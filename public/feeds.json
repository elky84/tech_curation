        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are excited to announce the latest Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Build Insights features. These updates provide developers with greater control and accuracy when diagnosing and optimizing C++ builds directly within Visual Studio.\nDownload Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview\nWe extend our thanks to the developer community, particularly our game studio partners, for providing invaluable feedback. Your input plays a vital role in shaping these new features.\nLearn more about Build Insights with our tutorials and documentation:\nC++ Build Insights | Microsoft Learn \nTutorial: Troubleshoot function inlining on build time | Microsoft Learn \nTutorial: Troubleshoot header file impact on build time | Microsoft Learn\nRun Build Insights on Selected Files\nThis feature is a game-changer for those who want to target specific files without analyzing the entire project. You can select a few files, run Build Insights on them, and see exactly how these files impact build performance. It’s perfect for fine-tuning your project and making targeted optimizations. \n\nFilter Projects \nWorking in a multi-project environment? The Project Filter feature allows you to focus your diagnostics on the projects most relevant to your current work. For instance, you can filter the analysis to focus solely on the core components of a specific project, making it easier to pinpoint areas that need optimization. \n \nFilter Files Using a Glob Pattern\nThe File Path Filter is incredibly useful for narrowing down your analysis to specific directories or excluding paths that aren’t relevant to your task. For example, you can exclude third-party libraries and focus only on parts of the codebase critical to the current build. \n \nView Explanation with Documentation Link\nYou can now see a short description of how each tab of Build Insights can be used, along with a link to the documentation for a detailed explanation. \n\nEnhanced Save Experience \nNow you can designate a folder to automatically store the reports so you can easily access them during your investigation. This will save you the work of manually specifying a folder each time you save your reports. \n \n \nPath Updates\nWe have added a File Name column for both files and translation units. displayed by default to help you quickly identify files without parsing lengthy paths. Additionally, we have hidden full and relative paths to reduce clutter. To see full paths, simply hover over the file.  \n\nNew Metrics \nWe have added two new columns, “Exclusive Duration” (Self) and “Inclusive Duration” (Total): \nExclusive Duration: Measures the time spent solely on the current task. \nInclusive Duration: Captures the total time spent on a task, including all nested tasks. \n \nRenaming of Time Column to Wall Time Responsibility \nWhen we introduced the “Time” column in Visual Studio Build Insights, we aimed to simplify the naming. However, we’ve found that it may cause confusion. While the column has always shown Wall Clock Time Responsibility (WCTR) or Wall Time Responsibility —which adjusts for parallelism by factoring in how tasks overlap — many users assumed it represented raw task duration. \nTo provide better clarity, we’re renaming this column to “Wall Time Responsibility”. This more accurately reflects what the data is measuring: the true impact of each task on the overall build time, especially in parallel environments. We believe this change will help developers gain clearer insights and optimize their builds more effectively. \nSend Us Your Feedback! \nReady to experience the new features in Visual Studio 2022 17.12? Download it today and start optimizing your C++ builds with Build Insights. Don’t forget to share your feedback with us to help shape future updates! \nLet us know your thoughts and what additional capabilities you’d like to see from this feature next!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Vidhya Arvind, Rajasekhar Ummadisetty, Joey Lynch, Vinay Chella\nIntroduction\nAt Netflix our ability to deliver seamless, high-quality, streaming experiences to millions of users hinges on robust, global backend infrastructure. Central to this infrastructure is our use of multiple online distributed databases such as Apache Cassandra, a NoSQL database known for its high availability and scalability. Cassandra serves as the backbone for a diverse array of use cases within Netflix, ranging from user sign-ups and storing viewing histories to supporting real-time analytics and live streaming.\nOver time as new key-value databases were introduced and service owners launched new use cases, we encountered numerous challenges with datastore misuse. Firstly, developers struggled to reason about consistency, durability and performance in this complex global deployment across multiple stores. Second, developers had to constantly re-learn new data modeling practices and common yet critical data access patterns. These include challenges with tail latency and idempotency, managing “wide” partitions with many rows, handling single large “fat” columns, and slow response pagination. Additionally, the tight coupling with multiple native database APIs — APIs that continually evolve and sometimes introduce backward-incompatible changes — resulted in org-wide engineering efforts to maintain and optimize our microservice’s data access.\nTo overcome these challenges, we developed a holistic approach that builds upon our Data Gateway Platform. This approach led to the creation of several foundational abstraction services, the most mature of which is our Key-Value (KV) Data Abstraction Layer (DAL). This abstraction simplifies data access, enhances the reliability of our infrastructure, and enables us to support the broad spectrum of use cases that Netflix demands with minimal developer effort.\nIn this post, we dive deep into how Netflix’s KV abstraction works, the architectural principles guiding its design, the challenges we faced in scaling diverse use cases, and the technical innovations that have allowed us to achieve the performance and reliability required by Netflix’s global operations.\nThe Key-Value Service\nThe KV data abstraction service was introduced to solve the persistent challenges we faced with data access patterns in our distributed databases. Our goal was to build a versatile and efficient data storage solution that could handle a wide variety of use cases, ranging from the simplest hashmaps to more complex data structures, all while ensuring high availability, tunable consistency, and low latency.\nData Model\nAt its core, the KV abstraction is built around a two-level map architecture. The first level is a hashed string ID (the primary key), and the second level is a sorted map of a key-value pair of bytes. This model supports both simple and complex data models, balancing flexibility and efficiency.\nHashMap<String, SortedMap<Bytes, Bytes>>\nFor complex data models such as structured Records or time-ordered Events, this two-level approach handles hierarchical structures effectively, allowing related data to be retrieved together. For simpler use cases, it also represents flat key-value Maps (e.g. id → {\"\" → value}) or named Sets (e.g.id → {key → \"\"}). This adaptability allows the KV abstraction to be used in hundreds of diverse use cases, making it a versatile solution for managing both simple and complex data models in large-scale infrastructures like Netflix.\nThe KV data can be visualized at a high level, as shown in the diagram below, where three records are shown.\n\nmessage Item (   \n  Bytes    key,\n  Bytes    value,\n  Metadata metadata,\n  Integer  chunk\n)\nDatabase Agnostic Abstraction\nThe KV abstraction is designed to hide the implementation details of the underlying database, offering a consistent interface to application developers regardless of the optimal storage system for that use case. While Cassandra is one example, the abstraction works with multiple data stores like EVCache, DynamoDB, RocksDB, etc…\nFor example, when implemented with Cassandra, the abstraction leverages Cassandra’s partitioning and clustering capabilities. The record ID acts as the partition key, and the item key as the clustering column:\n\nThe corresponding Data Definition Language (DDL) for this structure in Cassandra is:\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <ns>.<table> (\n  id             text,\n  key            blob,\n  value          blob,\n  value_metadata blob,\nPRIMARY KEY (id, key))\nWITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (key <ASC|DESC>)\nNamespace: Logical and Physical Configuration\nA namespace defines where and how data is stored, providing logical and physical separation while abstracting the underlying storage systems. It also serves as central configuration of access patterns such as consistency or latency targets. Each namespace may use different backends: Cassandra, EVCache, or combinations of multiple. This flexibility allows our Data Platform to route different use cases to the most suitable storage system based on performance, durability, and consistency needs. Developers just provide their data problem rather than a database solution!\nIn this example configuration, the ngsegment namespace is backed by both a Cassandra cluster and an EVCache caching layer, allowing for highly durable persistent storage and lower-latency point reads.\n\"persistence_configuration\":[                                                   \n  {                                                                           \n    \"id\":\"PRIMARY_STORAGE\",                                                 \n    \"physical_storage\": {                                                    \n      \"type\":\"CASSANDRA\",                                                 \n      \"cluster\":\"cassandra_kv_ngsegment\",                                \n      \"dataset\":\"ngsegment\",                                             \n      \"table\":\"ngsegment\",                                               \n      \"regions\": [\"us-east-1\"],\n      \"config\": {\n        \"consistency_scope\": \"LOCAL\",\n        \"consistency_target\": \"READ_YOUR_WRITES\"\n      }                                            \n    }                                                                       \n  },                                                                          \n  {                                                                           \n    \"id\":\"CACHE\",                                                           \n    \"physical_storage\": {                                                    \n      \"type\":\"CACHE\",                                                     \n      \"cluster\":\"evcache_kv_ngsegment\"                                   \n     },                                                                      \n     \"config\": {                                                              \n       \"default_cache_ttl\": 180s                                             \n     }                                                                       \n  }                                                                           \n] \n \nKey APIs of the KV Abstraction\nTo support diverse use-cases, the KV abstraction provides four basic CRUD APIs:\nPutItems — Write one or more Items to a Record\nThe PutItems API is an upsert operation, it can insert new data or update existing data in the two-level map structure.\nmessage PutItemRequest (\n  IdempotencyToken idempotency_token,\n  string           namespace, \n  string           id, \n  List<Item>       items\n)\nAs you can see, the request includes the namespace, Record ID, one or more items, and an idempotency token to ensure retries of the same write are safe. Chunked data can be written by staging chunks and then committing them with appropriate metadata (e.g. number of chunks).\nGetItems — Read one or more Items from a Record\nThe GetItemsAPI provides a structured and adaptive way to fetch data using ID, predicates, and selection mechanisms. This approach balances the need to retrieve large volumes of data while meeting stringent Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for performance and reliability.\nmessage GetItemsRequest (\n  String              namespace,\n  String              id,\n  Predicate           predicate,\n  Selection           selection,\n  Map<String, Struct> signals\n)\nThe GetItemsRequest includes several key parameters:\n\nNamespace: Specifies the logical dataset or table\nId: Identifies the entry in the top-level HashMap\nPredicate: Filters the matching items and can retrieve all items (match_all), specific items (match_keys), or a range (match_range)\nSelection: Narrows returned responses for example page_size_bytes for pagination, item_limit for limiting the total number of items across pages and include/exclude to include or exclude large values from responses\nSignals: Provides in-band signaling to indicate client capabilities, such as supporting client compression or chunking.\n\nThe GetItemResponse message contains the matching data:\nmessage GetItemResponse (\n  List<Item>       items,\n  Optional<String> next_page_token\n)\nItems: A list of retrieved items based on the Predicate and Selection defined in the request.\nNext Page Token: An optional token indicating the position for subsequent reads if needed, essential for handling large data sets across multiple requests. Pagination is a critical component for efficiently managing data retrieval, especially when dealing with large datasets that could exceed typical response size limits.\n\nDeleteItems — Delete one or more Items from a Record\nThe DeleteItems API provides flexible options for removing data, including record-level, item-level, and range deletes — all while supporting idempotency.\nmessage DeleteItemsRequest (\n  IdempotencyToken idempotency_token,\n  String           namespace,\n  String           id,\n  Predicate        predicate\n)\nJust like in the GetItems API, the Predicate allows one or more Items to be addressed at once:\n\nRecord-Level Deletes (match_all): Removes the entire record in constant latency regardless of the number of items in the record.\nItem-Range Deletes (match_range): This deletes a range of items within a Record. Useful for keeping “n-newest” or prefix path deletion.\nItem-Level Deletes (match_keys): Deletes one or more individual items.\n\nSome storage engines (any store which defers true deletion) such as Cassandra struggle with high volumes of deletes due to tombstone and compaction overhead. Key-Value optimizes both record and range deletes to generate a single tombstone for the operation — you can learn more about tombstones in About Deletes and Tombstones.\nItem-level deletes create many tombstones but KV hides that storage engine complexity via TTL-based deletes with jitter. Instead of immediate deletion, item metadata is updated as expired with randomly jittered TTL applied to stagger deletions. This technique maintains read pagination protections. While this doesn’t completely solve the problem it reduces load spikes and helps maintain consistent performance while compaction catches up. These strategies help maintain system performance, reduce read overhead, and meet SLOs by minimizing the impact of deletes.\nComplex Mutate and Scan APIs\nBeyond simple CRUD on single Records, KV also supports complex multi-item and multi-record mutations and scans via MutateItems and ScanItems APIs. PutItems also supports atomic writes of large blob data within a single Item via a chunked protocol. These complex APIs require careful consideration to ensure predictable linear low-latency and we will share details on their implementation in a future post.\nDesign Philosophies for reliable and predictable performance\nIdempotency to fight tail latencies\nTo ensure data integrity the PutItems and DeleteItems APIs use idempotency tokens, which uniquely identify each mutative operation and guarantee that operations are logically executed in order, even when hedged or retried for latency reasons. This is especially crucial in last-write-wins databases like Cassandra, where ensuring the correct order and de-duplication of requests is vital.\nIn the Key-Value abstraction, idempotency tokens contain a generation timestamp and random nonce token. Either or both may be required by backing storage engines to de-duplicate mutations.\nmessage IdempotencyToken (\n  Timestamp generation_time,\n  String    token\n)\nAt Netflix, client-generated monotonic tokens are preferred due to their reliability, especially in environments where network delays could impact server-side token generation. This combines a client provided monotonic generation_time timestamp with a 128 bit random UUID token. Although clock-based token generation can suffer from clock skew, our tests on EC2 Nitro instances show drift is minimal (under 1 millisecond). In some cases that require stronger ordering, regionally unique tokens can be generated using tools like Zookeeper, or globally unique tokens such as a transaction IDs can be used.\nThe following graphs illustrate the observed clock skew on our Cassandra fleet, suggesting the safety of this technique on modern cloud VMs with direct access to high-quality clocks. To further maintain safety, KV servers reject writes bearing tokens with large drift both preventing silent write discard (write has timestamp far in past) and immutable doomstones (write has a timestamp far in future) in storage engines vulnerable to those.\n\nHandling Large Data through Chunking\nKey-Value is also designed to efficiently handle large blobs, a common challenge for traditional key-value stores. Databases often face limitations on the amount of data that can be stored per key or partition. To address these constraints, KV uses transparent chunking to manage large data efficiently.\nFor items smaller than 1 MiB, data is stored directly in the main backing storage (e.g. Cassandra), ensuring fast and efficient access. However, for larger items, only the id, key, and metadata are stored in the primary storage, while the actual data is split into smaller chunks and stored separately in chunk storage. This chunk storage can also be Cassandra but with a different partitioning scheme optimized for handling large values. The idempotency token ties all these writes together into one atomic operation.\nBy splitting large items into chunks, we ensure that latency scales linearly with the size of the data, making the system both predictable and efficient. A future blog post will describe the chunking architecture in more detail, including its intricacies and optimization strategies.\nClient-Side Compression\nThe KV abstraction leverages client-side payload compression to optimize performance, especially for large data transfers. While many databases offer server-side compression, handling compression on the client side reduces expensive server CPU usage, network bandwidth, and disk I/O. In one of our deployments, which helps power Netflix’s search, enabling client-side compression reduced payload sizes by 75%, significantly improving cost efficiency.\nSmarter Pagination\nWe chose payload size in bytes as the limit per response page rather than the number of items because it allows us to provide predictable operation SLOs. For instance, we can provide a single-digit millisecond SLO on a 2 MiB page read. Conversely, using the number of items per page as the limit would result in unpredictable latencies due to significant variations in item size. A request for 10 items per page could result in vastly different latencies if each item was 1 KiB versus 1 MiB.\nUsing bytes as a limit poses challenges as few backing stores support byte-based pagination; most data stores use the number of results e.g. DynamoDB and Cassandra limit by number of items or rows. To address this, we use a static limit for the initial queries to the backing store, query with this limit, and process the results. If more data is needed to meet the byte limit, additional queries are executed until the limit is met, the excess result is discarded and a page token is generated.\nThis static limit can lead to inefficiencies, one large item in the result may cause us to discard many results, while small items may require multiple iterations to fill a page, resulting in read amplification. To mitigate these issues, we implemented adaptive pagination which dynamically tunes the limits based on observed data.\nAdaptive Pagination\nWhen an initial request is made, a query is executed in the storage engine, and the results are retrieved. As the consumer processes these results, the system tracks the number of items consumed and the total size used. This data helps calculate an approximate item size, which is stored in the page token. For subsequent page requests, this stored information allows the server to apply the appropriate limits to the underlying storage, reducing unnecessary work and minimizing read amplification.\nWhile this method is effective for follow-up page requests, what happens with the initial request? In addition to storing item size information in the page token, the server also estimates the average item size for a given namespace and caches it locally. This cached estimate helps the server set a more optimal limit on the backing store for the initial request, improving efficiency. The server continuously adjusts this limit based on recent query patterns or other factors to keep it accurate. For subsequent pages, the server uses both the cached data and the information in the page token to fine-tune the limits.\n\nIn addition to adaptive pagination, a mechanism is in place to send a response early if the server detects that processing the request is at risk of exceeding the request’s latency SLO.\nFor example, let us assume a client submits a GetItems request with a per-page limit of 2 MiB and a maximum end-to-end latency limit of 500ms. While processing this request, the server retrieves data from the backing store. This particular record has thousands of small items so it would normally take longer than the 500ms SLO to gather the full page of data. If this happens, the client would receive an SLO violation error, causing the request to fail even though there is nothing exceptional. To prevent this, the server tracks the elapsed time while fetching data. If it determines that continuing to retrieve more data might breach the SLO, the server will stop processing further results and return a response with a pagination token.\n\nThis approach ensures that requests are processed within the SLO, even if the full page size isn’t met, giving clients predictable progress. Furthermore, if the client is a gRPC server with proper deadlines, the client is smart enough not to issue further requests, reducing useless work.\nIf you want to know more, the How Netflix Ensures Highly-Reliable Online Stateful Systems article talks in further detail about these and many other techniques.\nSignaling\nKV uses in-band messaging we call signaling that allows the dynamic configuration of the client and enables it to communicate its capabilities to the server. This ensures that configuration settings and tuning parameters can be exchanged seamlessly between the client and server. Without signaling, the client would need static configuration — requiring a redeployment for each change — or, with dynamic configuration, would require coordination with the client team.\nFor server-side signals, when the client is initialized, it sends a handshake to the server. The server responds back with signals, such as target or max latency SLOs, allowing the client to dynamically adjust timeouts and hedging policies. Handshakes are then made periodically in the background to keep the configuration current. For client-communicated signals, the client, along with each request, communicates its capabilities, such as whether it can handle compression, chunking, and other features.\n\nKV Usage @ Netflix\nThe KV abstraction powers several key Netflix use cases, including:\n\nStreaming Metadata: High-throughput, low-latency access to streaming metadata, ensuring personalized content delivery in real-time.\nUser Profiles: Efficient storage and retrieval of user preferences and history, enabling seamless, personalized experiences across devices.\nMessaging: Storage and retrieval of push registry for messaging needs, enabling the millions of requests to flow through.\nReal-Time Analytics: This persists large-scale impression and provides insights into user behavior and system performance, moving data from offline to online and vice versa.\n\nFuture Enhancements\nLooking forward, we plan to enhance the KV abstraction with:\n\nLifecycle Management: Fine-grained control over data retention and deletion.\nSummarization: Techniques to improve retrieval efficiency by summarizing records with many items into fewer backing rows.\nNew Storage Engines: Integration with more storage systems to support new use cases.\nDictionary Compression: Further reducing data size while maintaining performance.\n\nConclusion\nThe Key-Value service at Netflix is a flexible, cost-effective solution that supports a wide range of data patterns and use cases, from low to high traffic scenarios, including critical Netflix streaming use-cases. The simple yet robust design allows it to handle diverse data models like HashMaps, Sets, Event storage, Lists, and Graphs. It abstracts the complexity of the underlying databases from our developers, which enables our application engineers to focus on solving business problems instead of becoming experts in every storage engine and their distributed consistency models. As Netflix continues to innovate in online datastores, the KV abstraction remains a central component in managing data efficiently and reliably at scale, ensuring a solid foundation for future growth.\nAcknowledgments: Special thanks to our stunning colleagues who contributed to Key Value’s success: William Schor, Mengqing Wang, Chandrasekhar Thumuluru, John Lu, George Cambell, Ammar Khaku, Jordan West, Chris Lohfink, Matt Lehman, and the whole online datastores team (ODS, f.k.a CDE).\n\nIntroducing Netflix’s Key-Value Data Abstraction Layer was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Early Access Program for CLion 2024.3 is officially launched. The first EAP build 243.12818.61 is now available, giving you an early glimpse into the enhancements we’ll include in the upcoming major release. You can download the build for free from the link below, via the Toolbox App, or as a snap package if you’re using Ubuntu.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 EAP\nGive it a try and let us know what you think about the changes. Share your feedback in the comments section or via our issue tracker.\nRead on to learn more about the key features and updates in CLion Nova, embedded development integrations, and other IDE components.\nEnhanced cloud code completion\nCLion’s cloud code completion powered by JetBrains AI Assistant has become faster and smarter thanks to the internally trained large language model (LLM) for C++. One of the most prominent results is the improved multiline code completion, with enhanced usage scenarios, syntax highlighting, and incremental acceptance of code suggestions.\n\n\n\n\nMultiline code suggestions work in conjunction with standard code completion and full line code completion (the latter uses the local LLM and doesn’t require sending data to the cloud). This allows you to review and accept suggestions gradually. You can also accept suggestions word by word using the shortcut ⌥→ for macOS and Ctrl+→ for Windows.\nThe updated cloud completion now offers a broader range of usage scenarios, with enhanced suffix matching ensuring that the predicted code fragment correctly completes the existing code.\nIf you have installed AI Assistant, the new cloud code completion is enabled by default. You can manage it via Settings | Editor | General | Inline Completion.\nNote that these features are available only to users with a trial or paid subscription to the JetBrains AI Assistant plugin.\nCLion Nova\nThe notable improvements can be broken down into two main categories: language-specific and those related to IDE memory usage.\nLanguage-specific improvements\nWe’ve added one of the most requested features – predefined code styles from other languages and frameworks, including LLVM, Qt, Google, GNU, and more (CPP-36365). You can select your preferred code style via Settings | Editor | Code Style | C/C++ | Set from… \nOne of the UI updates is support for a gutter icon for recursive calls:\n\n\n\n\nThis makes it easier to see where you are using recursive functions in your code and to avoid potentially harmful situations like stack overflows.\nWe’ve also enhanced CLion Nova with support for some of the newest standard library features and for switch cases with a range of values, which is a GNU extension.\nMemory usage improvements\nMany improvements in CLion Nova have helped reduce the memory footprint, which is especially noticeable in large projects. We’ve tested the result of these optimizations by comparing the memory usage of a Chromium project in CLion Nova 2024.2 and 2024.3 (EAP). The result showed that, in the new version, the IDE frontend uses 51% less memory while the IDE backend uses 15% less.\n\n\n\n\nFrom a user perspective, the most tangible result of these numbers is the following:\nThe IDE is now more responsive because it uses less memory, and the garbage collector is called less often. This is especially helpful on hosts with limited memory. \nThe IDE is ready to work faster and more responsive to project modifications.\nProject formats, build tools, and debugging\nWe’ve fixed an issue that was slowing down the reload of some medium and large CMake projects (CPP-39211). The reload time has been reduced from minutes to seconds.\nThe following bundles have been updated:\nCMake to 3.30.\nLLDB to 18. Note that the JetBrains LLDB fork used for the MSVC toolchain still uses an older version of LLDB.\nEmbedded development\nSeveral enhancements have been made to the PlatformIO integration, including the following:\nPlatformIO is now detected when installed via Homebrew and venv.\nCLion correctly identifies source files in PlatformIO projects, and code analysis works as it should.\nThe upload action is now available for all targets, even those not explicitly added to env.\nOther updates related to embedded development include:\nThe Serial Port Monitor plugin now correctly detects the ports of USB devices that are set via soft link paths. The plugin has also received UI improvements.\nThe Zephyr West config files now have syntax highlighting to make the code easier to read and understand.\nSupport for .dts and .dtsi files has been extended. C preprocessor directives such as #ifdef CONFIG_SPL and #ifdef CONFIG_ROCKCHIP_EXTERNAL_TPL are now processed correctly and do not cause syntax errors.\nOther improvements\nIf you are just starting with CLion, this update is for you. We’ve improved the onboarding tips so that you can try out some of CLion’s key features and get a clearer picture of its capabilities right from the start. The main goal is to help you learn the IDE faster.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, starting with v2024.3, the new terminal is the default. It provides features such as separating command output into distinct visual blocks and completion for command names, flags, arguments, and paths. To learn more about the new terminal, see our documentation.\nRead the full release notes on our YouTrack page. Learn more about our plans for this release in the CLion 2024.3 roadmap.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 EAP\nCall for feedback\nYour feedback is important to us, as your experiences and insights are essential to our mission of continuously improving CLion. Please share your ideas in the comments section below or submit them to our issue tracker. We would also be interested in setting up a quick call with you to learn more about your specific use cases.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With the new YouTrack 2024.3 release, one of the most hotly anticipated functionalities in the YouTrack roadmap – apps – goes live! Apps help teams customize YouTrack to fit their specific needs, improving project management, reporting, automation, and integration with other tools. You can now use and create apps to extend YouTrack’s functionality and add new features, tools, and integrations that aren’t available out of the box.\nFollowing this latest update, Text-to-Issue Transformation is also now available thanks to the power of AI. You can now effortlessly create tasks from any selected text. The AI scans your text for actionable items and enables you to convert them into issues with just a few clicks. This gives you the flexibility to quickly generate new issues whenever you need them, streamlining your workflow like never before. \nLet’s take a closer look at what’s available with this major update.\nCustomize YouTrack with apps\n\n\n\n\nWhat are YouTrack apps?\nApps extend and customize YouTrack so that it works exactly the way your team needs it to. They are small programs that project administrators can install into YouTrack to enhance or change its functionality. Apps may include workflows that automate some processes, or they can be designed to change the way YouTrack behaves – for example, they may add action buttons or widgets in various parts of your task view, as well as articles or even an additional section in the top bar menu leading to a separate page.\nApps can work as a connector between different systems. For example, this means you can get snapshots of data from an external source by registering a webhook (e.g., your customer data platform) in your customer tickets in the helpdesk or add buttons that transform the information from YouTrack and export it to a dashboard on your corporate portal – the possibilities are endless.\nApps functionality is available to both YouTrack Cloud and YouTrack Server customers. As a result, YouTrack is now even more flexible. If you need to extend YouTrack with some functionality that is not yet available out of the box, one option would now be to explore whether you could do this by building an app.\n\n\n\n\nWhere to get Apps\nUse the preinstalled Apps\nSeveral apps come bundled with YouTrack by default. They are intended to provide the functionality that used to be available via default workflows and widgets for dashboards. In the Administration – Apps menu, you will see apps that can be used to import tasks and projects from various sources, such as Jira Migration Manager, Widgets for Dashboards, as well as the other various predefined workflows that you can choose to enable for your projects. All your previously added workflows will also be displayed here, enabling admins to manage everything in one place.\n\n\n\n\nDashboard widgets\nWith this release, dashboard widgets are now taken care of by apps. This simplifies the management of widgets and also opens up new customization possibilities. Widgets can now be more easily modified or extended through apps, giving you greater control over how information is displayed on your dashboards.\n\n\n\n\nBrowse JetBrains Marketplace\nBeyond the default apps included with YouTrack, JetBrains has also developed several other apps that can already be downloaded for free from JetBrains Marketplace.\nThe Article Feedback app adds a widget that lets you collect and analyze reader feedback for articles in the YouTrack Knowledge Base.\nThe Vote Histogram app displays a visualization of voting activity over time for a specific issue.\nThe Slack User Status app adds a Slack widget to user cards. The widget displays the user’s name and title, their current status, and includes a button that you can click to open a direct message in your Slack workspace.\nBelow, you’ll find some examples of the apps that have been created by our partners and customized according to their clients’ needs.\nMulti-Sprint Planner for software developers by twenty20\nThis app helps software development teams working on scrum boards manage sprints and backlogs more easily. It adds a new section to YouTrack’s main menu where multiple sprints can be viewed at once – one sprint per lane. With such a view, it’s easier to structure the project into multiple sprints and better organize the development process.\nPlease feel free to check the app – it’s available in the JetBrains Marketplace for free.\n\n\n\n\nExtension for YouTrack for legal teams by AgiLawer\nFor the needs of legal teams, YouTrack consulting partner AgiLawyer recommends integrating YouTrack with LegiSpace, a platform that centralizes information and seamlessly connects with multiple other tools. This powerful combination simplifies daily operations by streamlining legal management processes, such as client case management, reporting of billable hours, invoicing, and many more, all enhanced by the LegiSpace app within YouTrack. The Legispace app connects the YouTrack task to the customer profile and the cases and documents in the Legispace app.\nIf you’re interested in expanding YouTrack’s capabilities for your legal needs, reach out to the AgiLawyer team for a demo to see how customization can benefit you.\n\n\n\n\nEveryone is welcome to publish any apps they’ve created on JetBrains Marketplace. When an app is submitted, the JetBrains team will check it, and once it has been successfully verified, the app will be made available for anyone to install. We hope that with the help of our strong user community, the collection of available apps will continue to grow.\nBring your app requests to your consulting partners or to the YouTrack team\nIn addition to those published on Marketplace, you can always create an app yourself or use one created by a consulting partner based on your needs and set it up directly in your YouTrack. Creating apps requires some coding experience. If you need a custom solution tailored to your company’s requirements but don’t have that resource in your team, please feel free to reach out to our consulting partners for help. When your YouTrack is upgraded to the 2024.3 version, the option for setting up apps becomes available automatically.\nYou can also share your business requirements with the YouTrack Support team, and we’ll discuss if it is possible to create a solution for you with our paid premium support service.\nMaking the app available for your team\nEach app can be used for your entire YouTrack instance on the global level or enabled for specific projects only. Administrators can manage the users and groups who will have access to an app by using visibility controls. YouTrack apps have a set of options that you can use to restrict visibility for certain users.\nCreate your own app\nYou can start developing your app right away. Here are some resources for getting started.\nBrowse through our documentation, including the Quick Start Guide for app creators.\nCheck out the sample app for reference, which you can then upload to your YouTrack. Please refer to this part of the documentation to help you install the demo app. This example will give you hands-on experience with the basic structure and functionality of an app, allowing you to see firsthand how modules are implemented and how they interact with YouTrack’s existing features. For example, it adds widgets directly to your task above custom fields, quotes to the top and bottom in the description, a toolbar in the Show more section, and a Main menu item.\nWhen your app is ready, you can choose to restrict its use to internal personnel only, share it with your customers directly, or publish it to JetBrains Marketplace for everyone to download.\nApp monetization and next steps\nWe have only just made apps available, so the collection of ready-to-download apps is still relatively small. However, we are confident that it will soon grow with the effort of our community, partners, and the JetBrains team. Furthermore, we hope that apps will help speed up the implementation of requested features from our YouTrack public issue tracker.\nFor now, all the apps available on JetBrains Marketplace can be downloaded for free. For newly created apps, it’s now possible to publish the app to JetBrains Marketplace so it’s free to download for everyone. However, if you have billing set up on your side, it’s also possible to have monetization built in as part of an app. \nIn time, we’re planning to add an option to publish paid apps, enabling app authors to be remunerated for the custom solutions they provide, though there is no firm date for introducing this option yet.\nWe at the YouTrack team will be happy to collaborate with app authors by inviting our technological and consulting partners to share information about brilliant, complex apps in our media to encourage customers to reach out to you for the paid version. Please feel free to contact us to discuss this opportunity further.\nText-to-Issue Transformation\nThe power of AI has made it possible to implement one of the most hotly anticipated functionalities in our roadmap, allowing users to create new tasks in seconds. With this feature, you can scan selected text for possible action items, choose which ones to transform into issues, and finally create them all at once.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can use the selected text to generate new issues. This helps to quickly create a hierarchy of tasks and subtasks for them using the meta issue.\n\n\n\n\nGeneric VCS Integrations\nSoftware development teams frequently use integrations with popular VCS systems available out of the box. With this in mind, we have added an option to integrate with VCS besides those included in the list.\nYou can now manually attach commits to issues in YouTrack, ensuring that your development process stays organized and transparent. Additionally, you can programmatically add links using webhooks.\n\n\n\n\nUI enhancements\nSeveral pages in YouTrack have been tidied up and polished. This includes dashboards, the project list, and the workflow administration page.\n \nCheck out the release notes for the full technical details and a comprehensive list of bug fixes and improvements in this release. For details on configuring the latest features, see the documentation.\nIf you use YouTrack Cloud, you’ll automatically be upgraded to YouTrack 2024.3 in accordance with our Maintenance Calendar.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "New and updated Java language features, core API, and the JVM – Java 23 packs it all – for new Java developers to senior developers. IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 is ready with its support for Java 23 features.\nKeeping pace with new Java version releases could be difficult – what changed, why, and how to use new and updated features. In this blog post, I’ll cover some of the new and updated features in Java 23 – the pain points they address for you, their syntax and semantics, and how IntelliJ IDEA can help you to use them.\nI’ll highlight Java 23 features, such as the inclusion of the primitive data types in pattern matching, the ability to import modules in code bases, the possibility to use Markdown in documentation comments, implicitly declared classes and instance main methods, and Flexible Constructor Bodies. If you are interested, this link includes a list of other Java 23 features.\nLet’s quickly configure IntelliJ IDEA before deep diving into the details of Java 23 features.\nIntelliJ IDEA Configuration\nJava 23 support is available in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2, released recently.\nIn your Project Settings, set the SDK to Java 23. You can both configure IntelliJ IDEA to use a downloaded version of JDK 23, or select to download it from a list of vendors, without exiting the IDE. For the language level, select ‘23(Preview) – Primitive types in patterns, implicitly declared classes, etc.’, as shown in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\n\nTo use production feature, such as, Markdown documentation comments, change the language level, to ‘23 – Markdown documentation comments.’, as shown in the below settings screenshot:\n\n\n\n\nWith the IntelliJ IDEA configuration under your belt, let’s deep dive into learning the new features. \nPrimitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview Feature)\nImagine you need to write a conditional construct that executes code based on whether the value of a long variable matches a few literal values, or falls in a range of values. \nHow would you do that? Until now, you could only use an if/else construct to do so. But, with Java 23, Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch, a preview language feature, you could code this functionality using the more expressive and easy-to-read switch constructs, using long values in the case labels. \nWhat does it mean to add primitive types to Pattern Matching?\nUntil Java 23, switch constructs (statements and expressions) worked with reference variables and some primitives data types, such as int, byte, short (with constraints). Also, the instanceof operator couldn’t be used with any primitive data type. \nWith Java 23, you will be able to use ALL the primitive data types, including boolean, long, float, double and long, with pattern matching in Switch constructs and instanceof operators. This applies to using it in nesting and top level contexts. \nWhy should you care about this feature? The worth of a feature depends on how large the codebase it affects and how often. Since conditional statements are one of the basics of programming, you could expect to see usage of this feature a lot in your codebase. Even if you might not write the code, you would read code written by someone else.\nLet’s understand this feature using an example.\nAn example (replacing long if-else statements with switch expression)\nImagine a method, say, getHTTPCodeDesc(int), accepts an HTTP server code as an int value and returns a corresponding String representation, checking it against a literal value or a range of values. \nThere doesn’t seem to be any obvious issue with this code – we all have either written or read similar code. However, it might take longer to process the flow of an if-else construct because they COULD define complicated conditions that are NOT limited to just one variable. Let’s keep it simple and assume that the method getHTTPCodeDesc() is defined as follows: \npublic String getHTTPCodeDesc(int code) {\n   if (code == 100) {\n       return \"Continue\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 200) {\n       return \"OK\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 301) {\n       return \"Moved permanently\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 302) {\n       return \"Found\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 400) {\n       return \"Bad request\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 500) {\n       return \"Internal server error\";\n   } \n   else if (code == 502) {\n       return \"Bad gateway\";\n   } \n   else if (code > 100 && code < 200) {\n       return \"Informational\";\n   } \n   else if (code > 200 && code < 300) {\n       return \"Successful\";\n   } \n   else if (code > 302 && code < 400) {\n       return \"Redirection\";\n   } \n   else if (code > 400 && code < 500) {\n       return \"Client error\";\n   } \n   else if (code > 502 && code < 600) {\n       return \"Server error\";\n   } \n   else {\n       return \"Unknown error\";\n   }\n}\nIn Java 23, the preceding code could be replaced using a switch expression (using primitives as patterns), as follows:\npublic String getHTTPCodeDesc(int code) {\n    return switch(code) {\n        case 100 -> \"Continue\";\n        case 200 -> \"OK\";\n        case 301 -> \"Moved Permanently\";\n        case 302 -> \"Found\";\n        case 400 -> \"Bad Request\";\n        case 500 -> \"Internal Server Error\";\n        case 502 -> \"Bad Gateway\";\n        case int i when i > 100 && i < 200 -> \"Informational\";\n        case int i when i > 200 && i < 300 -> \"Successful\";\n        case int i when i > 302 && i < 400 -> \"Redirection\";\n        case int i when i > 400 && i < 500 -> \"Client Error\";\n        case int i when i > 502 && i < 600 -> \"Server Error\";\n        default                            -> \"Unknown error\";\n    };\n}\nThe first obvious benefit in the preceding code is that it is much easier to read and understand than the version that uses if-else statements. You can understand the code logic at a glance. \nAnother not-so-obvious benefit (but an important one) is how the preceding code decreases the cognitive load for you. Cognitive load refers to the amount of information you have in your working memory (working memory space is limited). If you try to overload your working memory with instructions or information not directly related to your end goal then your productivity drops. Code snippets that are easier to read help you focus your attention on other areas of the code. Such small wins help a lot when we talk about how often we could benefit from them.\nLet’s talk about the simple parts now, I mean the syntax. As you can notice, the case labels can have both – constant values (such as 100, 200, etc.) and also a range of values specified using pattern matching, using type patterns (int i) with guards (when i > 100 && i < 200). You can also define a default clause.\nIn the preceding code, the method getHTTPCodeDesc() returns a value using the switch expression. Irrespective of the value that you pass to the method parameter, that is, code, the method must return a value. In other words, the switch expression must be exhaustive. If it isn’t IntelliJ IDEA can detect it and offer the addition of the default clause, as shown in the following GIF:\n\n\n\n\nThe preceding code switches on a variable of type int. Similarly you can switch on variables of all the other primitive types, such as, long, double, float, etc.\nAre you new to Pattern matching or recent changes to the switch construct?\nIf you are completely new to Pattern Matching, check out the section on its basics in my blog post Java 17 and IntelliJ IDEA. If you are interested in how Pattern Matching is being used with the switch constructs, I have another detailed blogpost on this topic: Evolution of the Switch Construct in Java—Why Should you Care? It covers how switch constructs use pattern matching to check reference values against different patterns and execute code conditionally, depending on the type of variable and its attributes.\nUsing pattern matching with boolean values\nIt is common to read and write code that returns a value based on whether the value of a boolean variable is true or false. For example, in the following code, the method calculateDiscount, calculates and returns a discount value depending on whether you pass true or false to the method parameter isPremiumMember:\npublic class DiscountCalculator {\n    private static final int PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 20;\n    private static final int REGULAR_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE = 5;\n\n    public int calculateDiscount(boolean isPremiumMember, int totalAmount) {\n        int discount;\n        if (isPremiumMember) {\n            // Calculate discount for premium members\n            discount = (totalAmount * PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE) / 100;\n        } else {\n            // Calculate discount for regular members\n            discount = (totalAmount * REGULAR_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE) / 100;\n        }\n        return discount;\n    }\n}\nInstead of an if-else construct, you can switch over the value of the boolean method parameter isPremiumMember, without requiring the definition of the local variable discount, as follows:\npublic int calculateDiscount(boolean isPremiumMember, int totalAmount) {\n    return switch (isPremiumMember) {\n        case true -> (totalAmount * PREMIUM_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE) / 100;\n        case false -> (totalAmount * REGULAR_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE) / 100;\n    };\n}\nSince the switch expression in the method calculateDiscount() is exhaustive, if you miss any of the true or false values, IntelliJ IDEA can detect it and suggest you to insert a default or the missing true/ false case, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nUsing primitive types with the instanceof operator \nUntil Java 23, none of the primitive types could be used with the instanceof operator.\nThe instanceof operator can be used to check the type of a variable, and execute code conditionally. With pattern matching for instanceof, you could also declare and initialize pattern variables if the type of a variable being compared matched without the type pattern without the need for an explicit casting. The instanceof variable can also use guard patterns.\nWith the addition of primitive types to the instanceof operator, you could define code such as the following:\nimport static java.io.IO.println;\n\nvoid main() {\n    var weight = 68;\n    if (weight instanceof byte byteWeight && byteWeight <= 70) {\n        println(\"Weight less than 70\");\n    }\n}\nNote that the feature Implicitly declared classes and instance main method in Java 23 defines java.io.IO with static methods that allows you to import it and use println() to output values to console, rather than using System.out.println() to do so.\nIf you plan to check for more types and conditions, you could use a switch construct with guard, as follows:\nvar weight = 68;\n\nswitch (weight) {\n    case byte b when b <= 70                    -> println(\"byte: less than 70\");\n    case int i  when i <= 700                   -> println(\"int: less than 7000\");\n    case long l when l >= 7_000 && l <= 70_000  -> println(\"long range: 7_000 - 70_000\");\n    case double d                               -> println(\"double\");\n}\n \nSafe conversion between data types \nWhen you use pattern matching with primitive data types, the Java compiler ensures that there is no loss of information. In the following example, the instanceof operator can convert between the double and byte data types when it detects it is safe to do so:\ndouble height = 67;\n\nif (height instanceof byte byteHeight)\n    System.out.println(byteHeight);\nSimilar code wouldn’t execute without an instanceof operator. The following code won’t compile:\ndouble height = 67;\n\nfinal byte convertToByte = height;\nRobust data flow analysis in IntelliJ IDEA\nIntelliJ IDEA offers robust support for primitive types in switch statements, and it also integrates sophisticated data-flow analysis to help developers avoid common issues. As shown in the following example, the data-flow analysis in IntelliJ IDEA can determine that the second case label, that is, case int _ and the rest of the case labels are not reachable (since the code exits from the method if the value of the variable weight is more than 70). IntelliJ IDEA warns you about unreachable code and offers appropriate suggestions:\n\n\n\n\nRecords and primitives data type components\nImagine you define a record Person as follows:\nrecord Person(String name, double weight) {}\nUntil now, you could decompose it to the exact data types. However, with this feature you could use other compatible data types, such as, int, long etc. Here is an example:\nPerson person = new Person(\"Java\", 672);\n\nswitch (person) {\n    case Person(String name, byte weight) -> println(\"byte:\" + weight);\n    case Person(String name, int weight) -> println(\"int:\"  + weight);\n    case Person(String name, double weight) -> println(\"double:\" + weight);\n    case Person(String name, long weight) -> println(\"long:\" + weight);\n    default -> throw new IllegalStateException(\"Unexpected value: \" + person);\n}\nYou could use it with the instanceof operator too, as follows:\n if (person instanceof Person(String name, byte weight)) {\n     System.out.println(\"Instanceof : \" + weight);\n }\nWhat’s next in IntelliJ IDEA to support this feature\nMore support on the primitive data types in Pattern Matching is in works, including the ability to use the postfix operator .switch on all the primitive data types to start writing a switch construct. Support is also in works to convert an existing if-else statement to a switch construct that uses primitive data types – so that it is more easier for you to adopt this new feature.\nMarkdown documentation comments (Production feature)\nUntil now the Java documentation comments were coded using HTML and JavaDoc tags. With this new feature, that is, \n\nDocumentation comments, you’ll also be able to use Markdown to write the JavaDoc comments. This is a production feature in Java 23.\nAre you wondering what is the reason for this change?\nOne of the reasons is that HTML is no longer a popular choice with new developers (even though it was a great choice back when Java was introduced in the late 1990s). It is not simple to write HTML manually. Also, Markdown is easier to write, read, and can be easily transformed to HTML. A lot of developers are using Markdown to document their code, write books, articles, blog posts, generate website pages, and much more. \nLet’s see how you can use Markdown to write Javadoc comments in your source code file and how IntelliJ IDEA can help.\nAn example\nThe Markdown documentation comments start with ///. \nThe choice for using three black slashes is interesting. Jonathan Gibbons, owner of this feature at Oracle, shared that it is not an easy task to change the syntax of features in the Java language. Multiline comments start with /* and end with */. This makes it difficult to include any code in the documentation that might include */. Hence, the Markdown documentation comments start with ///. \nThe old way of writing the documentation comments, that is, HTML and JavaDoc tags are supported too. Jonathan also mentioned that it was not feasible to convert JavaDoc tags to the Markdown equivalent. So, the developers can use a combination of Markdown comments and JavaDoc tags to get the best of both worlds.\nHere’s an example that uses Markdown and Javadoc tags for documenting a method:\n///\n/// **Getting started and having fun learning Java :)**\n///\n/// Prints a pattern of the letter 'P' using the specified character.\n///\n/// @param size the size of the pattern\n/// @param charToPrint the character to use for the pattern\n///\nprivate void printP(int size, char charToPrint) {\n    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\n        for (int j = 0; j < size; j++) {\n            if (j == 0 || (i == 0 || i == size / 2) && j < size - 1 || (j == size - 1 && i <= size / 2)) {\n                System.out.print(charToPrint + \" \");\n            } else {\n                System.out.print(\"  \");\n            }\n        }\n        System.out.println();\n    }\n}\nIntelliJ IDEA can help you switch between your views in the editor and check how the documentation comments would appear to anyone reading the Java documentation comments.\nViewing Java Documentation comments in IntelliJ IDEA\nJonathan Gibbons, owner of the JEP ‘Markdown Documentation Comments’ emphasized the need for all developers to check if the Java documentation comments they added to their codebase are correct. \nIntelliJ IDEA provides a ‘Reader mode’ that enables you to view Java documentation comments in your source code. You can also switch between the Java documentation comments code and how it is viewed using the feature ‘Toggle Rendered View’, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nWriting Markdown Documentation Comments in IntelliJ IDEA\nIntelliJ IDEA can detect you are using Markdown to document a method. When you start with /// and hit Enter, it will add /// on the next line too, as shown in the following GIF:\n\n\n\n\nShould you convert your existing documentation comments to use Markdown?\nHere’s a gif showing the documentation of the method hashCode written using markdown in IntelliJ IDEA. Using ‘Toggle Rendered View’ you can easily view the documentation in the reader view, which is much easier to read and understand. \n\n\n\n\nIdeally, I wouldn’t encourage you to convert your existing documentation to using Markdown, unless your developers or API users have major readability issues when they are viewing your (API, libraries, Framework) code base using tools that don’t offer an alternate view like IntelliJ IDEA. \nModule Import Declarations (Preview Feature)\nWith this feature, you can import a module library like the Java API in your class or interface using a single statement, such as, import module java.base, which will import all the packages that are exported by module java.base. \nYou wouldn’t need separate import statements to import packages like java.util, or say, java.io in your class because these are exported by java.base.\nAn example\nThe following code example uses classes from the package java.io and java.util. By including the statement ‘import java.base’, you don’t need to import the java.io and java.util packages individually since they are exported by the module java.base:\nimport module java.base;\npublic class ImportModuleHelloWorld {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n\n        try {\n            InputStream inputStream = new BufferedInputStream(\n                                            new FileInputStream(\n                                                   new File(\"abc.txt\")));\n        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n\n        Map<String, String> list = new HashMap<>();\n    }\n}\nHowever, if you delete the import module statement from the top, IntelliJ IDEA will import individual classes and interfaces from the packages java.io and java.util. This is shown in the following GIF:\n\n\n\n\nWhich packages are exported by the module java.base (or other modules)?\nIt is simple to answer this question when you are using IntelliJ IDEA. Click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut (Go to Declaration or Usages) and you could view the definition of this module to find out all the modules exported by this module. This is shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nImplicit Declared classes and Instance Main methods (Third Preview)\nIntroduced as a preview language feature in Java 21, this feature is in its third preview in Java 23.\nIt is here to change how new Java developers would get started learning Java. It simplifies the initial steps for students when they start learning basics, such as variable assignment, sequence, conditions and iteration. Students no longer need to declare an explicit class to develop their code, or write their main() method using this signature – public static void main(String []). With this feature, classes could be declared implicitly and the main() method can be created with a shorter list of keywords.\nIf you are new to this feature, I’d highly recommend you to check out my detailed blog post: ‘HelloWorld’ and ‘main()’ meet minimalistic on this feature. In this section, I’ll include the additions to this feature in Java 23. \nUsing packages exported by module java.base without importing them explicitly\nBy including just one import statement, that is, import module java.base, at the top of your implicit class, you’ll be able to automatically import the packages exported by java.base. This means that your implicit class will no longer need individual import statements for these classes or packages, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nSimplifying code to write to interact with the console\nInteraction with the console – printing messages, or consuming messages is one of the frequently used actions by new Java developers. This has been simplified further in this feature.  \nYour implicitly declared classes can output messages to he console by using methods println() and print() and read String messages using the readln() method without explicitly importing them in your class. All these methods are declared in a new top-level class java.io.IO, which is implicitly imported by implicit classes.\nTake a moment and see and how you need to explicit import them in a regular class, as shown in the following GIF:\n\nThe following gif shows you doesn’t need explicit imports when you use the same previous methods in an implicit class:\n\nFlexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)\nThis is the second preview of a feature in JDK 22, previously called “Statements before super()”. Apart from the change in the feature name, this feature has an important change. It is now possible to initialize fields before calling super() or this(). \nThis is useful when a superclass calls a method from its constructor and you want to override this method in a subclass and want to access a field from the subclass inside this method. Previously, the subclass field would not be initialized when the method was called from the superclass constructor. Now it is possible to initialize the field and prevent surprises. Here’s an example code to show this feature:\nabstract class Action {\n    public Action() {\n        System.out.println(\"performing \" + getText());\n    }\n    public abstract String getText();\n}\n\nclass DoubleAction extends Action {\n    private final String text;\n    private DoubleAction(String text) {\n        this.text = text; // this did not compile before Java 23 with preview features enabled.\n        super();\n    }\n\n    @Override public String getText() {\n        return text + text;\n    }\n}\nIf you are new to this feature, don’t miss checking out my detailed blog post on this feature, https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2024/02/constructor-makeover-in-java-22/, which talks about the why and how of this feature.\nPreview Features\n\n\nOf the features that I covered in this blog post, ‘Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch’, ‘Modeule Import Declarations’, ‘Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods’ and ‘Flexible constructor bodies’ are preview language features in Java 23. With Java’s new release cadence of six months, new language features are released as preview features. They may be reintroduced in later Java versions in the second or more preview, with or without changes. Once they are stable enough, they may be added to Java as a standard language feature.\n\n\nPreview language features are complete but not permanent, which essentially means that these features are ready to be used by developers, although their finer details could change in future Java releases depending on developer feedback. Unlike an API, language features can’t be deprecated in the future. So, if you have feedback about any of the preview language features, feel free to share it on the JDK mailing list (free registration required).\n\n\nBecause of how these features work, IntelliJ IDEA is committed to only supporting preview features for the current JDK. Preview language features can change across Java versions, until they are dropped or added as a standard language feature. Code that uses a preview language feature from an older release of the Java SE Platform might not compile or run on a newer release.\nSummary\nIn this blog post, I covered five Java 23 features – Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch, Markdown Documentation Comments, Module Import Declarations, Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods, and Flexible constructor bodies.\nCheck out these new features to find out how they can help you improve your applications.\nHappy Coding!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Many teams are using GraphQL for their API needs, thanks to its powerful query language and flexibility. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL lets you fetch the data you need in a single request, making your applications more efficient and responsive.\nHowever, it can be daunting getting started creating schemas, writing queries, and integrating GraphQL into your .NET application. Using JetBrains Rider’s GraphQL plugin and the StrawberryShake framework, building an application that consumes a GraphQL API is not that hard. \nIn this blog post, we’ll discuss setting up your environment, defining schemas, generating client code, and seamlessly integrating it all into a sample project. Here we go!\nDownload JetBrains Rider\n                                                    \nWhat is GraphQL?\nBefore we dig into building a sample application, let’s quickly recap GraphQL and its benefits. GraphQL, developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing queries based on a user-defined type system.\nIf you have been a .NET developer for a while, you may have already worked with OData. Conceptually, GraphQL is similar in that it lets you request exactly the data you need from an API, eliminating the typical over-fetching or under-fetching issues you may see in REST APIs. For example, in a typical REST API, you may want to retrieve customer data and either need to make a second request to get their address details or always get the address details in the response, even when they’re not always required..\nUnlike most REST APIs, a GraphQL API exposes a single endpoint you can query for any data you need. The endpoint can define several operations, all of which are self-documenting through a schema. A schema provides a comprehensive and queryable description of the API structure, types, and available operations. The schema also defines types and relationships between them, ensuring clients know exactly what data is available and receive helpful error messages when things go wrong.\nThere are a few concepts to keep in mind throughout this post:\nQueries – These are used to fetch data from the server, similar to GET requests in REST, but much more powerful thanks to their flexibility in fetching nested and related data in a single request.\nSubscriptions – These are used to subscribe to data from the server, and return new data or updates from the server when new data is available.\nMutations – Used to modify data on the server (e.g., creating, updating, deleting records), similar to POST, PUT, or DELETE in REST.\nSchema – defines the types and relationships in your API, specifying what queries and mutations are available. It ensures both the client and the server agree on the data structure and types.\nOne more thing to cover: when implementing a GraphQL API, you have two transport protocols to consider for data exchange: HTTP and WebSockets. HTTP is typically used for traditional query and mutation operations, where clients send HTTP GET and POST requests to the GraphQL server and receive responses containing the requested data. This method is straightforward and works well for most cases where data changes are infrequent or do not need to be immediately reflected on the client.\nOn the other hand, WebSockets are used for real-time applications requiring instant updates, such as live chat, online gaming, or real-time dashboards. GraphQL subscriptions use WebSockets to maintain a persistent connection between the client and the server, enabling the server to push updates to the client as soon as data changes occur. This reduces latency and provides a more responsive user experience compared to polling mechanisms often used with HTTP.\nChoosing between HTTP and WebSockets depends on your application’s specific requirements. For most standard operations, HTTP is sufficient and simpler to implement. However, for real-time data updates, integrating WebSockets with GraphQL subscriptions can significantly enhance your application’s interactivity and responsiveness. Also, both transports can be used in conjunction when building solutions. In this post, we’ll use an HTTP endpoint as our example to work with.\nNote: If you want to learn more about how REST, GraphQL, and gRPC compare, check out this talk from JetBrains .NET Days Online by Poornima Nayar.\nWhat is StrawberryShake?\nNow, let’s talk about StrawberryShake. This open-source .NET library simplifies building GraphQL clients by generating strongly-typed client-side code from your GraphQL schema and queries. This means less boilerplate and more focus on what matters – your application logic.\nIt uses source generators to generate all the client-side code based on the GraphQL schema you define or introspect from a GraphQL API.\nPrerequisites\nLet’s transition into a practical example. First, let’s make sure you have the GraphQL plugin installed in JetBrains Rider. This plugin is necessary for providing syntax highlighting, validation, and auto-completion for GraphQL schemas and queries, streamlining your development process.\nOpen JetBrains Rider and bring up the Settings/Preferences menu. Go to Plugins in the left-hand sidebar, and search for “GraphQL” in the Marketplace tab. Click Install to add the plugin to your Rider setup. You may need to restart Rider to activate the plugin.\n\n\n\n\nWe’re ready to jump into creating our project and setting everything up in JetBrains Rider. Let’s get to work!\nCreating the project in Rider\nLet’s look at what we’ll build first. Since we’re focusing on building a GraphQL client, we’ll need an API to interact with. We’re in luck, because there are plenty of GraphQL APIs available. In this blog post, we’ll use Trevor Blades’ Countries GraphQL API, which provides data about countries around the world. The sample application will be a page that shows information about the countries included in that API, and a way to get more details for each.\nThe countries API endpoint is available at https://countries.trevorblades.com/, which exposes a playground where you can test your queries against it.\nNote: Michael Staib, founder of ChilliCream (the company that also builds the StrawberryShake project we use in this blog post) was a guest in one of our livestreams to talk about building a GraphQL server with ASP.NET Core and HotChocolate.\nIn JetBrains Rider, create a new Web App project using the Razor Pages template. Give it a name, such as the very original “Countries” I used here:\n\n\n\n\nWhile not required, for this sample, I removed some of the default CSS in the project and included PicoCSS – a great small CSS framework that makes any web page look nice. Here’s my updated _Layout.cshtml:\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n   <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n   <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n   <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"light dark\">\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css\" />\n   <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"~/css/site.css\" asp-append-version=\"true\" />\n   <title>@ViewData[\"Title\"] - Countries</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<main class=\"container\">\n   <header>\n       <nav>\n           <ul>\n               <li><strong>Countries</strong></li>\n           </ul>\n           <ul>\n               <li><a href=\"/\">Index</a></li>\n           </ul>\n       </nav>\n   </header>\n   @RenderBody()\n</main>\n\n\n<script src=\"~/js/site.js\" asp-append-version=\"true\"></script>\n\n\n@await RenderSectionAsync(\"Scripts\", required: false)\n<script type=\"module\" defer>\n import { polyfillCountryFlagEmojis } from \"https://cdn.skypack.dev/country-flag-emoji-polyfill\";\n polyfillCountryFlagEmojis();\n</script>\n</body>\n</html>\nYou can also clone a copy of this project from GitHub, and explore individual commits if you want to follow along.\nWorking with GraphQL in Rider\nTime for GraphQL! In your C# project, use the context menu to add a new GraphQL Config file and paste the following contents into it:\nschema: schema.graphql\nextensions:\n endpoints:\n   production:\n     url: https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql/\n     headers:\n       Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}\ndocuments: '**/*.graphql'\nThis graphql.config.yml file will be used by Rider to access the schema for the countries API, and generate queries that can be executed inside the IDE. This configuration file also defines one or more endpoints, and potential headers required to access an endpoint, such as authorization headers. The countries API doesn’t require authentication, but we’ll see in a second why I added it here anyways.\nIn the left-hand gutter, right next to the production endpoint, you’ll see a Run icon:\n\n\n\n\nClick it to run an introspection of the remote schema. When you do, you’ll see a popup that lets you enter an authorization token. You can skip it, but this is why I added the ${TOKEN} placeholder earlier: to show you how to add variables into the GraphQL configuration.\nWhen finished, a schema.graphql file is automatically added to your project, listing all the types, fields, and operations exposed by the countries API. Note the toolbar at the top of the editor: you can switch to a different endpoint if you have e.g. a staging and production GraphQL API to work with, and there’s a Refresh button to re-run schema introspection and update the types, fields, and operations in the API.\n\n\n\n\nThe toolbar also contains a Run button, which is not very useful yet. Let’s change that! In our application, I’d like to show a list of all countries with their country code, name, and flag image. Add a new file called listcountries.graphql, and paste the following query into it:\nquery ListCountries {\n   countries {\n       code\n       name\n       emoji\n   }\n}\nThis snippet defines a GraphQL query (named “ListCountries”) that retrieves information from a collection on the API endpoint called “countries”. This query returns an array of Country elements, and each contains the code, name, and emoji. Note that you can Cmd+Click or Ctrl+Click on the name to navigate to the schema’s definition of available data and collections.\nNow is a good time to try the Run button in the editor. You’ll see Rider opens a tool window showing the query result:\n\n\n\n\nWhile we’re creating queries in Rider, let’s add one more file: getcountry.graphql, and paste the following contents into it:\nuery GetCountry($countryCode: ID!) {\n   country(code: $countryCode) {\n       code\n       name\n       emoji\n       capital\n       currency\n       languages {\n           code\n           name\n       }\n       ...Continent\n   }\n}\n\n\nfragment Continent on Country {\n   continent {\n       code\n       name\n   }\n}\nThis query will be used in our sample application to display details for a specific country. The query is named GetCountry, and requires a parameter $countryCode. It then requests data from the GraphQL API, requesting a country (by $countryCode) and returning various fields of information from it.\nAnother interesting bit in this query is that we’re not only fetching the country data but also its related continent. If you do not need that data, you can keep it out of the query and get a smaller response payload size. You will also see the fields queried for a continent are defined as a fragment. This is a way to make your GraphQL queries a bit more maintainable, as including the Continent on any query that works with Country now only means adding ...Continent and not the complete list of fields. This is not a requirement, and you can also write the entire query like this:\nquery GetCountry($countryCode: ID!) {\n   country(code: $countryCode) {\n       code\n       name\n       emoji\n       capital\n       currency\n       languages {\n           code\n           name\n       }\n       continent {\n           code\n           name\n       }\n   }\n}\nWith those two queries defined, let’s continue building our ASP.NET Core application.\nAdding StrawberryShake GraphQL source generation\nTo start generating the C# client for the countries GraphQL schema we just queried, you will need to add a NuGet package reference to StrawberryShake.Server. While named “server”, this package includes additional dependencies. to get you started with creating a GraphQL client.\nStrawberryShake also has a command line tool that can help set up code generation, but we’re not going to use that in this blog post.\nNext, add a file named .graphqlrc.json next to your graphql.config.yml. Paste the following contents into it:\n{\n \"schema\": \"schema.graphql\",\n \"documents\": \"**/*.graphql\",\n \"extensions\": {\n   \"strawberryShake\": {\n     \"name\": \"CountriesClient\",\n     \"namespace\": \"Countries.GraphQL\",\n     \"url\": \"https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql/\",\n     \"dependencyInjection\": true,\n     \"strictSchemaValidation\": true,\n     \"emitGeneratedCode\": true,\n     \"records\": {\n       \"inputs\": false,\n       \"entities\": false\n     },\n     \"transportProfiles\": [\n       {\n         \"default\": \"Http\",\n         \"subscription\": \"WebSocket\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n }\n}\nThis file looks similar to the graphql.config.yml file created earlier, but this time, it configures how StrawberryShake should generate C# code from the GraphQL API. It includes the API endpoint URL, the name of the generated client class (CountriesClient), its namespace, and whether to generate convenience extension methods to register the GraphQL client with ASP.NET Core’s service collection.\nIf you now build your solution, you should see a new type ICountriesClient you can work with, as well as an AddCountriesClient() extension method on IServiceCollection. \nIn Program.cs, you can use this extension method to wire up the generated GraphQL client:\n// ...\n\nvar builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);\n\n// Add services to the container.\nbuilder.Services.AddRazorPages();\nbuilder.Services.AddHttpClient();\nbuilder.Services\n   .AddCountriesClient()\n   .ConfigureHttpClient(\n       configureClient: client =>\n       {\n           client.BaseAddress = new Uri(\"https://countries.trevorblades.com/graphql/\");\n           // client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = AuthenticationHeaderValue.Parse($\"Bearer {Constants.ApiKey}\");\n       });\n\nvar app = builder.Build();\n\n// ...\nThe call to AddCountriesClient() will register all necessary services with ASP.NET Core. You will also need a call to ConfigureApiClient() to configure the GraphQL API endpoint URL. I left a comment in the code here showing how you would add bearer token authorization headers for authentication.\nWe’re ready to consume the GraphQL queries we defined earlier! In Index.cshtml.cs, add a constructor parameter that accepts an ICountriesClient and assign it to a field, or use a primary constructor.\npublic class IndexModel(ICountriesClient countriesClient) : PageModel\n{\n   // ...\n}\nIn the OnGet method, you can query the GraphQL endpoint and retrieve a list of countries. Here’s the full code for the IndexModel class that is used to render the page:\npublic class IndexModel(ICountriesClient countriesClient) : PageModel\n{\n   public IReadOnlyCollection<IListCountries_Countries> Countries { get; set; }\n\n   public async Task OnGet()\n   {\n       var countries = await countriesClient.ListCountries.ExecuteAsync();\n       if (countries.IsErrorResult())\n       {\n           // ...\n       }\n\n       Countries = countries.Data?.Countries ?? new List<IListCountries_Countries>(0);\n   }\n}\nYou’ll notice the countriesClient has a ListCountries property on which you can call ExecuteAsync() to fetch data. StrawberryShake generates this method, and the method may accept parameters as well. If you try calling the GetCountry method (which is generated based on the GetCountry query we defined in the previous section of this post), you’ll see the countryCode parameter can be passed in:\n\n\n\n\nThe ExecuteAsync() method always returns an object that contains information about the response. If an error is returned, you can check for it and log or otherwise handle the exception. If the response is successful, the Data property will contain an object representing the object defined in the *.graphql file earlier. In this example application, you can pass the data on to the Razor view.\nIn the Index.cshtml view, you can now consume the list of countries, and display each in a table:\n@page\n@model IndexModel\n@{\n   ViewData[\"Title\"] = \"Countries\";\n}\n\n\n<h1>Countries</h1>\n<table>\n   <thead>\n   <tr>\n       <th scope=\"col\">Country code</th>\n       <th scope=\"col\">Name</th>\n       <th scope=\"col\">Emoji</th>\n   </tr>\n   </thead>\n   <tbody>\n   @foreach (var country in Model.Countries)\n   {\n       <tr>\n           <td>@country.Code</td>\n           <td><a asp-page=\"Country\" asp-route-countryCode=\"@country.Code\">@country.Name</a></td>\n           <td>@country.Emoji</td>\n       </tr>\n   }\n   </tbody>\n</table>\nTry running it in your browser, and you should see a similar page to this:\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! You have successfully built an application that fetches data from a GraphQL API in C#. As a next step, try implementing the Details.cshtml page yourself (or check out the GitHub repository for this sample application to look at implementation details).\nConclusion\nIn this post, we’ve covered how to build a GraphQL client in .NET using JetBrains Rider and StrawberryShake. We’ve covered quite a bit of ground – from setting up your development environment and understanding the fundamentals of GraphQL, to defining schemas and queries, and finally integrating everything into a sample project.\nUsing JetBrains Rider’s GraphQL plugin and the StrawberryShake framework, we’ve seen how to create strongly-typed GraphQL clients and how to work with them in your C# projects.\nI encourage you to try this out on your projects. Experiment with different schemas and queries, and see how you can integrate GraphQL to make your applications more efficient and responsive.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to announce the public release of CodeCanvas, JetBrains’ new platform for orchestrating cloud development environments (CDEs). To better understand CodeCanvas and why it is important for JetBrains’ remote development strategy, let’s dive a bit into history and context.\nRemote development trend\nMany companies still rely on local development, a method that has several downsides, including onboarding difficulties, security risks, hardware limitations, and its inefficient use of developer time. All of this directly translates into higher costs for the business. \nTo address these issues, businesses have suggested using remote machines. Initially, this was supported through virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solutions, where only a “video stream” of the IDE from the remote machine was delivered to the local system. However, a major problem with this setup was the input lag when typing or moving the mouse.\nLater, a new approach evolved – IDEs began supporting a split model. Heavy backend processes would run on a remote machine, while a local client would run only a lightweight UI that connects to the backend. This setup improved responsiveness and is what we now know as remote development. It first appeared in VS Code and later in JetBrains IDEs. This solution seemed to resolve the main issues: Code no longer needed to reside on local machines, and remote machines could scale as needed.\n\n\n\n\nBut, as the number of these remote machines grew, managing them became more complex. Either users had to be granted access to the cloud services to create machines themselves, or the IT department had to manage the machines for them. Additionally, the cost of running these machines was significant, and ensuring they were used efficiently became essential.\nThis gave rise to a new category of tools: cloud development environment (CDE) orchestrators. These platforms manage the lifecycle of CDEs, scale resources, and ensure cost efficiency. \nCodeCanvas is JetBrains’ entry into this space that, in addition to general orchestration capabilities, offers many other valuable features.\nLooking to the future, remote development and CDEs perfectly align with the growing trend of AI-assisted development. As autonomous AI developers emerge, they will require scalable dev environments to execute tasks. CDE orchestrators, like CodeCanvas, will let these AI systems create and manage their own environments through APIs.\nCodeCanvas public release\nCodeCanvas was initially launched silently in May 2024 so that we could gather early feedback from select clients. Now, it’s finally ready for public release. We’re starting with version 2024.2, which is already available to install.\nWhy CodeCanvas\n\n\n\n\nThe remote development orchestration market is still young, and existing solutions often have limitations. By working closely with our customers who need remote development, we’ve identified these pain points and are addressing them with CodeCanvas. \nOur goal is to make working in a CDE feel no different than working in a local IDE, if not better. With CodeCanvas, developers no longer need to worry about cloning repositories, selecting the right IDE version, installing dependencies, starting services, first-time compilation, or indexing. In just 10–15 seconds, a fully prepared environment is ready, allowing developers to dive straight into coding.\nIn addition to core orchestration features, CodeCanvas offers:\nOn-premises installation: CodeCanvas is an on-premises solution deployed in Kubernetes clusters, currently supporting AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure. You can find more details about the architecture in the CodeCanvas documentation.\nAdvanced JetBrains IDE support: CodeCanvas provides first-class support for JetBrains IDEs, handling indexing, plugins, version management, and more. It supports most IntelliJ-based IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Rider, and others.\nVS Code support: For those who prefer a different editor.\nFlexible dev environment configurations: CodeCanvas allows you to configure dev environments with as much CPU, memory, and storage as needed. The only limit is your cloud provider’s resources.\nGPU support: Developers can create dev environments with GPU support, enabling them to run GPU workloads like ML training.\nAutomated preparation of CDEs: Use dev environment templates and lifecycle scripts to create pre-configured CDEs.\nReady-to-work environments: The warm-up feature helps developers start working in a CDE with already-built indexes, downloaded dependencies, and pre-built projects. Using a standby pool of pre-created CDEs, you can reduce the time to start a new environment almost to zero.\nSecurity: Multiple authentication options, connection to dev environments via SSH, personalized environment settings, and a robust permission system.\nEase of administration: A web-based UI allows administrators to manage users and their access to cluster resources, balance costs, and more.\nHow to get started\nTo try CodeCanvas or schedule a demo, contact our sales team. You can also check out our documentation to better understand how CodeCanvas works.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Jupyter notebooks allow you to tell stories by creating and sharing data, equations, and visualizations sequentially, with a supporting narrative as you go through the notebook.\nJupyter notebooks in PyCharm Professional provide functionality above and beyond that of browser-based Jupyter notebooks, such as code completion, dynamic plots, and quick statistics, to help you explore and work with your data quickly and effectively.  \nLet’s take a look at 7 ways you can use Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm to achieve your goals. They are:\nCreating or connecting to an existing notebook\nImporting your data\nGetting acquainted with your data\nUsing JetBrains AI Assistant \nExploring your code with PyCharm\nGetting insights from your code\nSharing your insights and charts\nThe Jupyter notebook that we used in this demo is available on GitHub.\n1. Creating or connecting to an existing notebook\nYou can create and work on your Jupyter notebooks locally or connect to one remotely with PyCharm. Let’s take a look at both options so you can decide for yourself.\nCreating a new Jupyter notebook\nTo work with a Jupyter notebook locally, you need to go to the Project tool window inside PyCharm, navigate to the location where you want to add the notebook, and invoke a new file. You can do this by using either your keyboard shortcuts ⌘N (macOS) / Alt+Ins (Windows/Linux) or by right-clicking and selecting New | Jupyter Notebook.\n\nGive your new notebook a name, and PyCharm will open it ready for you to start work. You can also drag local Jupyter notebooks into PyCharm, and the IDE will automatically recognise them for you. \nConnecting to a remote Jupyter notebook\nAlternatively, you can connect to a remote Jupyter notebook by selecting Tools | Add Jupyter Connection. You can then choose to start a local Jupyter server, connect to an existing running local Jupyter server, or connect to a Jupyter server using a URL – all of these options are supported.\nNow you have your Jupyter notebook, you need some data!\n2. Importing your data\nData generally comes in two formats, CSV or database. Let’s look at importing data from a CSV file first.\nImporting from a CSV file\nPolars and pandas are the two most commonly used libraries for importing data into Jupyter notebooks. I’ll give you code for both in this section, and you can check out the documentation for both Polars and pandas and learn how Polars is different to pandas. \nYou need to ensure your CSV is somewhere in your PyCharm project, perhaps in a folder called `data`. Then, you can invoke import pandas and subsequently use it to read the code in:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"../data/airlines.csv\")\nIn this example, airlines.csv is the file containing the data we want to manipulate. To run this and any code cell in PyCharm, use ⇧⏎ (macOS) / Shift+Enter (Windows/Linux). You can also use the green run arrows on the toolbar at the top.\nIf you prefer to use Polars, you can use this code:\nimport polars as pl\ndf = pl.read_csv(\"../data/airlines.csv\")\nImporting from a database\nIf your data is in a database, as is often the case for internal projects, importing it into a Jupyter notebook will require just a few more lines of code. First, you need to set up your database connection. In this example, we’re using postgreSQL. \nFor pandas, you need to use this code to read the data in:\nimport pandas as pd\nengine = create_engine(\"postgresql://jetbrains:jetbrains@localhost/demo\")\ndf = pd.read_sql(sql=text(\"SELECT * FROM airlines\"),\n                      con=engine.connect())\nAnd for Polars, it’s this code:\nimport polars as pl\nengine = create_engine(\"postgresql://jetbrains:jetbrains@localhost/demo\")\nconnection = engine.connect()\nquery = \"SELECT * FROM airlines\"\ndf = pl.read_database(query, connection)\n3. Getting acquainted with your data\nNow we’ve read our data in, we can take a look at the DataFrame or `df` as we will refer to it in our code. To print out the DataFrame, you only need a single line of code, regardless of which method you used to read the data in:\ndf\nDataFrames\nPyCharm displays your DataFrame as a table firstly so you can explore it. You can scroll horizontally through the DataFrame and click on any column header to order the data by that column. You can click on the Show Column Statistics icon on the right-hand side and select Compact or Detailed to get some helpful statistics on each column of data.   \n\nDynamic charts\nYou can use PyCharm to get a dynamic chart of your DataFrame by clicking on the Chart View icon on the left-hand side. We’re using pandas in this example, but Polars DataFrames also have the same option. \nClick on the Show Series Settings icon (a cog) on the right-hand side to configure your plot to meet your needs:\n\nIn this view, you can hover your mouse over your data to learn more about it and easily spot outliers:\n\nYou can do all of this with Polars, too. \n4. Using JetBrains AI Assistant\nJetBrains AI Assistant has several offerings that can make you more productive when you’re working with Jupyter notebooks inside PyCharm. Let’s take a closer look at how you can use JetBrains AI Assistant to explain a DataFrame, write code, and even explain errors. \nExplaining DataFrames\nIf you’ve got a DataFrame but are unsure where to start, you can click the purple AI icon on the right-hand side of the DataFrame and select Explain DataFrame. JetBrains AI Assistant will use its context to give you an overview of the DataFrame:\n\nYou can use the generated explanation to aid your understanding.\nWriting Code \nYou can also get JetBrains AI Assistant to help you write code. Perhaps you know what kind of plot you want, but you’re not 100% sure what the code should look like. Well, now you can use JetBrains AI Assistant to help you. Let’s say you want to use ‘matplotlib’ to create a chart that finds the relationship between ‘TimeMonthName’ and ‘MinutesDelayedWeather’. By specifying the column names, we’re giving more context to the request which improves the reliability of the generated code. Try it with the following prompt:\nGive me code using matplotlib to create a chart which finds the relationship between ‘TimeMonthName’ and ‘MinutesDelayedWeather’ for my dataframe df\nIf you like the resulting code, you can use the Insert Snippet at Caret button to insert the code and then run it:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n# Assuming your data is in a DataFrame named 'df'\n# Replace 'df' with the actual name of your DataFrame if different\n\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.bar(df['TimeMonthName'], df['MinutesDelayedWeather'], color='skyblue')\nplt.xlabel('Month')\nplt.ylabel('Minutes Delayed due to Weather')\nplt.title('Relationship between TimeMonthName and MinutesDelayedWeather')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n\nplt.show()\nIf you don’t want to open the AI Assistant tool window, you can use the AI cell prompt to ask your questions. For example, we can ask the same question here and get the code we need:\n\nExplaining errors\nYou can also get JetBrains AI Assistant to explain errors for you. When you get an error, click Explain with AI: \n\nYou can use the resulting output to further your understanding of the problem and perhaps even get some code to fix it!\n5. Exploring your code\nPyCharm can help you get an overview of your Jupyter notebook, complete parts of your code to save your fingers, refactor it as required, debug it, and even add integrations to help you take it to the next level.\nTips for navigating and optimizing your code\nOur Jupyter notebooks can grow large quite quickly, but thankfully you can use PyCharm’s Structure view to see all your notebook’s headings by clicking ⌘7 (macOS) / Alt+7 (Windows/Linux).\n\nCode completion\nAnother helpful feature that you can take advantage of when using Jupyter notebooks inside PyCharm is code completion. You get both basic and type-based code completion out of the box with PyCharm, but you can also enable Full Line Code Completion in PyCharm Professional, which uses a local AI model to provide suggestions. Lastly, JetBrains AI Assistant can also help you write code and discover new libraries and frameworks. \n\nRefactoring\nSometimes you need to refactor your code, and in that case, you only need to know one keyboard shortcut ⌃T (macOS) / Shift+Ctrl+Alt+T (Windows/Linux) then you can choose the refactoring you want to invoke. Pick from popular options such as Rename, Change Signature, and Introduce Variable, or lesser-known options such as Extract Method, to change your code without changing the semantics: \n\nAs your Jupyter notebook grows, it’s likely that your import statements will also grow. Sometimes you might import a package such as polars and numpy, but forget that numpy is a transitive dependency of the Polars library and as such, we don’t need to import it separately.  \nTo catch these cases and keep your code tidy, you can invoke Optimize Imports ⌃⌥O (macOS) / Ctrl+Alt+O (Windows/Linux) and PyCharm will remove the ones you don’t need. \nDebugging your code\nYou might not have used the debugger in PyCharm yet, and that’s okay. Just know that it’s there and ready to support you when you need to better understand some behavior in your Jupyter notebook. \nPlace a breakpoint on the line you’re interested in by clicking in the gutter or by using ⌘F8 (macOS) / Ctrl+F8 (Windows/Linux), and then run your code with the debugger attached with the debug icon on the top toolbar:\n\nYou can also invoke PyCharm’s debugger in your Jupyter notebook with ⌥⇧⏎ (macOS) / Shift+Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux). There are some restrictions when it comes to debugging your code in a Jupyter notebook, but please try this out for yourself and share your feedback with us. \nAdding integrations into PyCharm \nIDEs wouldn’t be complete without the integrations you need. PyCharm Professional 2024.2 brings two new integrations to your workflow: DataBricks and HuggingFace.\nYou can enable the integrations with both Databricks and HuggingFace by going to your Settings <kbd>⌘</kbd> (macOS) / <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+S</kbd> (Windows/Linux), selecting Plugins and searching for the plugin with the corresponding name on the Marketplace tab.\n6. Getting insights from your code\nWhen analyzing your data, there’s a difference between categorical and continuous variables. Categorical data has a finite number of discrete groups or categories, whereas continuous data is one continuous measurement. Let’s look at how we can extract different insights from both the categorical and continuous variables in our airlines dataset.\nContinuous variables\nWe can get a sense of how continuous data is distributed by looking at measures of the average value in that data and the spread of the data around the average. In normally distributed data, we can use the mean to measure the average and the standard deviation to measure the spread. However, when data is not distributed normally, we can get more accurate information using the median and the interquartile range (this is the difference between the seventy-fifth and twenty-fifth percentiles). Let’s look at one of our continuous variables to understand the difference between these measurements.\nIn our dataset, we have lots of continuous variables, but we’ll work with `NumDelaysLateAircraft` to see what we can learn. Let’s use the following code to get some summary statistics for just that column:\ndf['NumDelaysLateAircraft'].describe()\nLooking at this data, we can see that there is a big difference between the `mean` of ~789 and the ‘median’ (our fiftieth percentile, indicated by “50%” in the table below) of ~618.\n\nThis indicates a skew in our variable’s distribution, so let’s use PyCharm to explore it further. Click on the Chart View icon at the top left. Once the chart has been rendered, we’ll change the series settings represented by the cog on the right-hand side of the screen. Change your x-axis to `NumDelaysLateAircraft` and your y-axis to `NumDelaysLateAircraft`. \nNow drop down the y-axis using the little arrow and select `count`. The final step is to change the chart type to Histogram using the icons in the top-right corner:\n\nNow that we can see the skew laid out visually, we can see that most of the time, the delays are not too excessive. However, we have a number of more extreme delays – one aircraft is an outlier on the right and it was delayed by 4,509 minutes, which is just over three days!\nIn statistics, the mean is very sensitive to outliers because it’s a geometric average, unlike the median, which, if you ordered all observations in your variable, would sit exactly in the middle of these values. When the mean is higher than the median, it’s because you have outliers on the right-hand side of the data, the higher side, as we had here. In such cases, the median is a better indicator of the true average delay, as you can see if you look at the histogram.\nCategorical variables\nLet’s take a look at how we can use code to get some insights from our categorical variables. In order to get something that’s a little more interesting than just `AirportCode`, we’ll analyze how many aircraft were delayed by weather, `NumDelaysWeather`, in the different months of the year, `TimeMonthName`.\nUse this code to group `NumDelaysWeather` with `TimeMonthName`:\nresult = df[['TimeMonthName', 'NumDelaysWeather']].groupby('TimeMonthName').sum()\nresult\nThis gives us the DataFrame again in table format, but click the Chart View icon on the left-hand side of the  PyCharm UI to see what we can learn:\n\nThis is okay, but it would be helpful to have the months ordered according to the Gregorian calendar. Let’s first create a variable for the months that we expect:\nmonth_order = [\n   \"January\", \"February\", \"March\", \"April\", \"May\", \"June\",\n   \"July\", \"August\", \"September\", \"October\", \"November\", \"December\"\n]\nNow we can ask PyCharm to use the order that we’ve just defined in `month_order`:\n# Convert the 'TimeMonthName' column to a categorical type with the specified order\ndf[\"TimeMonthName\"] = pd.Categorical(df[\"TimeMonthName\"], categories=month_order, ordered=True)\n\n\n# Now you can group by 'TimeMonthName' and perform sum operation, specifying observed=False\nresult = df[['TimeMonthName', 'NumDelaysWeather']].groupby('TimeMonthName', observed=False).sum()\n\n\nresult\nWe then click on the Chart View icon once more, but something’s wrong!\n\nAre we really saying that there were no flights delayed in February? That can’t be right. Let’s check our assumption with some more code:\ndf['TimeMonthName'].value_counts()\nAha! Now we can see that `Febuary` has been misspelt in our data set, so the correct spelling in our variable name does not match. Let’s update the spelling in our dataset with this code:\ndf[\"TimeMonthName\"] = df[\"TimeMonthName\"].replace(\"Febuary\", \"February\")\ndf['TimeMonthName'].value_counts()\nGreat, that looks right. Now we should be able to re-run our earlier code and get a chart view that we can interpret:\n\nFrom this view, we can see that there is a higher number of delays during the months of December, January, and February, and then again in June, July, and August. However, we have not standardized this data against the total number of flights, so there may just be more flights in those months, which would cause these results along with an increased number of delays in those summer and winter months.\n7. Sharing your insights and charts\nWhen your masterpiece is complete, you’ll probably want to export data, and you can do that in various ways with Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm. \nExporting a DataFrame\nYou can export a DataFrame by clicking on the down arrow on the right-hand side:\n\nYou have lots of helpful formats to choose from, including SQL, CSV, and JSON:\n\nExporting charts\nIf you prefer to export the interactive plot, you can do that too by clicking on the Export to PNG icon on the right-hand side:\n\nViewing your notebook as a browser\nYou can view your whole Jupyter notebook at any time in a browser by clicking the icon in the top-right corner of your notebook:\n\nFinally, if you want to export your Jupyter notebook to a Python file, 2024.2 lets you do that too! Right-click on your Jupyter notebook in the Project tool window and select Convert to Python File. Follow the instructions, and you’re done!\nSummary\nUsing Jupyter notebooks inside PyCharm Professional provides extensive functionality, enabling you to create code faster, explore data easily, and export your projects in the formats that matter to you. \nDownload PyCharm Professional to try it out for yourself!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting a new project can be both exciting and challenging at the same time. Choosing what technologies will help you deliver your solution comes with the cost associated with those choices. Each additional technology can bring issues and dependencies that can lead to incremental decreases in progress that can grind your project to a stop. The front end is a common place where developers might experience decision fatigue. The popularity of frontend frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue brings a lot of value and expensive tradeoffs in tooling, security considerations, network traffic, and heavy initial payloads. If you’re feeling overwhelmed when making a front-end decision for your next project, this post is for you.\nIn this post, we’ll explore an up-and-coming library called Htmx that allows you to leverage your existing Spring Boot knowledge to deliver interactive user experiences while circumventing some of the frustrations you may have felt with other front-end frameworks. By the end of this post, you should be confident enough to add Htmx to a new or existing Spring Boot project.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA\n                                                    \nWhat is Htmx?\nTo understand what Htmx is, we must first understand philosophically what the library is attempting to accomplish. \nHtmx is unabashedly proud to be in the Hypermedia camp. Hypermedia is a term coined in 1965 by Ted Nelson, and it focuses on the idea that a single document may contain several interactive elements, such as text, images, videos, and links to other documents. If this sounds a lot like HTML, then you’d be right. HTML is the canonical example of this concept and has successfully delivered the internet we know today. Then, in 2015, the web development landscape changed.\nDuring the Web 2.0 era, web development began moving to separate the UI elements of web experiences into frontend and backend. Backend APIs delivered JSON or XML because these payloads were smaller than full HTML payloads. The front end was responsible for transforming data into presentational HTML using JavaScript. This pattern worked around limitations in the client and rendering speed and, at the time, delivered a better user experience to visitors. Since that time, a few things have changed:\nInternet speeds are significantly faster overall\nClients are much more efficient in rendering HTML\nJavaScript and JSON payloads have ballooned\nJavaScript tooling has become increasingly complex\nRegarding Htmx, in the context of modern applications, frontend frameworks may be a more considerable burden than the problems they claim to help solve. So, how does Htmx work differently?\nHtmx focuses on a declarative programming style, allowing you to decorate your existing HTML output with Htmx-specific attributes. These attributes give those HTML elements more functionality than they may typically have. The fundamental flow of all Htmx includes the following:\nA client-side trigger that raises an event\nThe event typically triggers a web request to a server backend\nThe server responds with an HTML fragment\nHtmx replaces an existing DOM element with the response\nLet’s look at a simple Htmx example, which we will implement using Spring Boot later.\n<button hx-post=\"/clicked\"\n    hx-trigger=\"click\"\n    hx-target=\"#parent-div\"\n    hx-swap=\"outerHTML\"\n>\n    Click Me!\n</button>\nThe hx- attributes allow this button to trigger an HTTP POST whenever clicked. Once the server responds, we will find the #parent-div and swap it with the resulting HTML.\nThese attributes are not exclusive to any HTML element and can be combined to create rich experiences. For example, here is a search box that triggers a request whenever the user changes the value:\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"q\"\n    hx-get=\"/trigger_delay\"\n    hx-trigger=\"keyup changed delay:500ms\"\n    hx-target=\"#search-results\"\n    placeholder=\"Search...\"\n>\n<div id=\"search-results\"></div>\nThis particular example also defines a delay of 500ms before making a request to the server, as a way to not make requests while the user is still typing, so that the server only receives the most relevant search queries and not all of them – a technique called “debouncing”.\nNow that you have a general idea of Htmx, let’s add it to a Spring Boot sample project and implement the backend for both snippets.\nYour first Htmx experience in Spring Boot\nBefore starting, I recommend installing the Htmx Support plugin for JetBrains IDEs. It will make your Htmx development experience that much better. Thanks, Hugo Mesquita!\nUse the New Project dialog in IntelliJ IDEA to create a new Spring Boot project. If you already have a Spring Boot project, skip this step.\n\n\n\n\nOn the next screen, choose the Spring Web and Thymeleaf dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start by first creating a new HomeController class. This will be where we add our application logic for our first sample.\npackage org.example.htmxdemo;\n\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\n\n@Controller\npublic class HomeController {\n    @GetMapping(\"/\")\n    public String home() {\n        return \"index\";\n    }\n}\nNext, let’s create our index HTML template file under resources/templates/index.html. Be sure to paste the following contents. The dependencies are already included in the head tag of the provided HTML and will be retrieved by the client when the page is rendered to users.\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html xmlns:th=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\" lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"light dark\" />\n    <title>Htmx Demo</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css\" >\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.1\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <main class=\"container\">\n        <section>\n        <h1>Htmx Demo</h1>\n        <div id=\"parent-div\"></div>\n        <button hx-post=\"/clicked\"\n                hx-trigger=\"click\"\n                hx-target=\"#parent-div\"\n                hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n            Click Me!\n        </button>\n        </section>\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\nHtmx is a no-build library, meaning you don’t need any additional dependencies to use it. As you notice, in the head element of our template, we only need a script reference to the library in our HTML. I’ve also included a CSS library, PicoCSS, to make things more aesthetically pleasing. Your output may look slightly different based on your development environment’s light/dark mode settings.\nEventually, you’ll want to download and store all third-party files alongside your code for a production setting.\nNext, return to the HomeController and implement the /clicked endpoint. Remember, this needs to be handled using the POST HTTP method. Using the appropriate HTTP methods to handle interactions can be essential to Htmx development. Generally, use GET for immutable calls and POST, PUT, and DELETE for mutating calls.\npackage org.example.htmxdemo;\n\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.ui.Model;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;\n\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime;\n\n@Controller\npublic class HomeController {\n    @GetMapping(\"/\")\n    public String home() {\n        return \"index\";\n    }\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/clicked\")\n    public String clicked(Model model) {\n        model.addAttribute(\"now\", LocalDateTime.now().toString());\n        return \"clicked :: result\";\n    }\n}\nFinally, let’s implement our HTML fragment in clicked.html, which we’ll place next to our other template files in resources/templates/.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n      xmlns:th=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\" lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n  <title>fragments</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div th:fragment=\"result\" id=\"parent-div\">\n    <p th:text=\"${now}\"></p>\n  </div>\n</body>\n</html>\nRunning our application, we can now click the button on our page and see the interface update in real-time.\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations. You have successfully handled the first of many Htmx requests to come!\nNow, let’s implement that search textbox for a more complex scenario.\nHtmx-powered Search in Spring Boot\nWe will add a new search feature to our sample, implementing the snippet previously shown. Let’s first update our HTML snippet to include the search user interface. In index.html, update the contents to match the following:\n<!DOCTYPE HTML>\n<html xmlns:th=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\" lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <title>Getting Started: Serving Web Content</title>\n    <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=UTF-8\"/>\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n    <meta name=\"color-scheme\" content=\"light dark\" />\n    <title>Htmx Demo</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@picocss/pico@2/css/pico.min.css\" >\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@2.0.1\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <main class=\"container\">\n        <section>\n        <h1>Htmx Demo</h1>\n        <div id=\"parent-div\"></div>\n        <button hx-post=\"/clicked\"\n                hx-trigger=\"click\"\n                hx-target=\"#parent-div\"\n                hx-swap=\"outerHTML\">\n            Click Me!\n        </button>\n        </section>\n\n        <section>\n            <input type=\"text\"\n                   name=\"q\"\n                   hx-get=\"/search\"\n                   hx-trigger=\"keyup changed delay:500ms\"\n                   hx-target=\"#search-results\"\n                   placeholder=\"Search...\"\n            >\n            <div th:replace=\"search::results\">\n            </div>\n        </section>\n\n    </main>\n</body>\n</html>\nCreate a new search.html file in resources/templates/ and copy the following content into the newly created file.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"\n      xmlns:th=\"http://www.thymeleaf.org\" lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <title>fragments</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"search-results\" th:fragment=\"results\">\n    <ul th:each=\"result: ${results}\">\n        <li th:text=\"${result}\"></li>\n    </ul>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>\nThis file contains our response fragment, which will display the results of the user-initiated search. Let’s update our HomeController one last time:\npackage org.example.htmxdemo;\n\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.ui.Model;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;\n\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@Controller\npublic class HomeController {\n\n    static List<String> searchResults =\n            List.of(\"one\", \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", \"five\");\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/\")\n    public String home(Model model) {\n        model.addAttribute(\"results\", searchResults);\n        return \"index\";\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/search\")\n    public String search(String q, Model model) {\n        var filtered = searchResults\n                .stream()\n                .filter(s -> s.startsWith(q.toLowerCase()))\n                .toList();\n\n        model.addAttribute(\"results\", filtered);\n        return \"search :: results\";\n    }\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/clicked\")\n    public String clicked(Model model) {\n        model.addAttribute(\"now\", LocalDateTime.now().toString());\n        return \"clicked :: result\";\n    }\n}\nLet’s pause here and consider what we’re doing with our HomeController class.\nOur home method sets the search results for the initial experience.\nOur index.html uses the search :: results fragment\nWhen the user types, the /search endpoint handles the query and returns the modified search :: results fragment with our new results.\nAll of this logic happens using our knowledge of Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. That’s pretty amazing. Rerun the application and start typing into the search box to see the filtered results.\n\n\n\n\nIt might not seem like it, but you implemented some complex Htmx scenarios. There’s still more to learn, and the basics described in this post are a great starting point.\nCommunity References\nHtmx has a growing community of excited developers, and we wanted to share some of their work with you. Knowing there is community enthusiasm for Htmx may help reduce your anxiety about adopting the technology.\nOfficial Htmx site and documentation – https://htmx.org/ \nJosh Long – HTMX and Spring Boot\nSivaLabs – Spring Boot Thymeleaf HTMX Tutorial\nDan Vega – Getting started with HTMX in Spring Boot with Thymeleaf\nWill Iverson –Spring Boot + HTMX = Easy Full Stack\nWim Deblauwe – Spring Tips: HTMX\nThose willing to look past the backend technology can also check out my guide series Htmx for ASP.NET Core developers, which has many samples and techniques that can be adapted to Spring Boot.\nFor folks seriously getting into Htmx development, check out the Spring Boot and Thymeleaf library for htmx, which adds helpful elements to your Spring Boot application.\nAlso, to get the sample code featured in this post, fellow Developer Advocate Marit van Djik pushed a complete sample to her GitHub repository. \nConclusion\nIf you suffer from front-end fatigue and prefer to work with backend tools like Spring Boot and Thymeleaf, you may consider Htmx for your next solution. In my opinion, one of Htmx’s strongest selling points is that you can layer it in incrementally. Some pages in your web application may utilize Htmx heavily, while others do not mention It. This can speed up your deliverables considerably, as you spend less time wrestling with JavaScript build tools and more time building solutions that users will love.\nWe hope you enjoyed this post. We’d love to hear about your experience integrating Htmx and Spring Boot. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to comment.",

Do you want to take advantage of the performance and power efficiency of running your apps natively on Arm64 devices? If so, you’ll be happy to hear that Visual Studio 2022 17.11 has a new feature that makes it easier than ever to do just that.\n\nVisual Studio 2022 natively supports building and debugging Arm64 apps on Arm-based processors. However, if you build your app with the AnyCPU setting, which is the default for most .NET projects, your app will run on an Arm64 device using x64 emulation. While this may seem counterintuitive, this approach allowed many apps with x64 dependencies to work reliably under emulation without requiring additional build or dependency changes.\nUnfortunately, under these conditions, it means your app won’t benefit from the native capabilities of the Arm64 CPU and may suffer from reduced performance and increased battery consumption.\nTo solve this problem, the Windows 24H2 update introduces a new setting for your app manifest files. This setting allows you to specify a list of supported architectures (currently amd64 or arm64) for your app, indicating that it should run natively on those platforms. For example, if you include arm64 in the list, your app will run using the Arm64 CLR on Arm64 devices when supported, even if it was built with the AnyCPU setting.\nHow to use the setting in Visual Studio 2022\nTo use the new setting in Visual Studio 2022, you need to do the following steps:\nMake sure you have the Windows 24H2 update installed on your development machine and your target device.\nOpen your .NET project in Visual Studio 2022 and right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select Properties.\n In the Build area confirm that the AnyCPU configuration is enabled and that the Prefer 32-bit option is unselected.\nSelect the new Prefer native ARM64 option.\nSave and rebuild your project.\nDeploy your app to your Arm64 device and run it. You can also debug it using Visual Studio 2022, which will automatically detect the correct architecture and launch the debugger accordingly.\n\nEnjoy the benefits of native Arm64 apps\nBy using the new setting in Visual Studio 2022, you can easily run and debug your .NET apps natively on Arm64 devices, without changing your code or your build configuration. This will help you improve the performance, reliability, and battery life of your apps, and give your users a better experience.\nWe hope you enjoy this new feature and find it useful for your development scenarios.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 introduced a new XAML designer for building WPF apps, with a goal of increasing the performance and reliability of the designer. The new designer can quickly open a XAML file by using WPF’s built-in parser and display. This new design has a nuanced behavior when the root XAML element derives from an abstract base class. This article helps with understanding implications for using an abstract base class and describes workarounds which can ensure a smooth design experience.\nThe Challenge with Abstract Base Classes\nWhen working with the XAML Designer, the base class of the root element is instantiated for display purposes. This allows developers to visualize and interact with their UI components directly within the designer, while the custom control is being developed. In the example screenshot below, the base class of the root element is UserControl. The custom control’s derived class is specified in the x:Class attribute as TestControl. Therefore, an instance of UserControl is instantiated for display in design view:\n\nHowever, an issue arises when the root element’s base class is abstract. Since abstract classes cannot be instantiated, the XAML Designer will find the first non-abstract base class and instantiate that instead. Most of the time, this will work well, but there are cases where this will break design view, possibly showing an error message. One case where design view breaks is when the abstract base class defines a property that is crucial for display, such as the Content property.\nIllustrative Example\nImagine you have an abstract base class as follows:\n\nIf this abstract class is the base class for your custom control, the XAML Designer will not be able to instantiate AbstractControlBase and will instead instantiate the Control class. The reason is that Control is the first non-abstract base class. This leads to any reference to AbstractControlBase being broken in design view. In the following screenshot, it shows how a ControlTemplate cannot be applied to AbstractControlBase, and the Content property cannot be used to display anything in design view:\n\nEffective Workarounds\nTo mitigate this issue, there are practical workarounds that ensure that the XAML Designer continues to function seamlessly.\n1. Move Display Properties to a Non-Abstract Base Class\nOne approach is to refactor your code by transferring the properties critical to design view to another level of base class that is not abstract. This adjustment allows the XAML Designer to instantiate and render the necessary components. The following code shows how the Content property was moved from AbstractControlBase to a new ControlBase class:\n\nIn the XAML file, the base class stays as AbstractControlBase, but the control template now applies to the concrete base class ControlBase:\n\n2. Utilize Standard Controls\nAnother strategy is to derive the abstract class from WPF’s ContentControl, which already provides common properties that are used for display in design view, such as the Content property. This method circumvents the instantiation issue associated with abstract classes, allowing your UI elements to be properly displayed while designing your XAML content.\n\n\nConclusion\nUnderstanding the implications of using abstract base classes and implementing effective workarounds can significantly enhance your design workflow. By moving properties to non-abstract base classes or utilizing standard controls, you can ensure that your UI components are rendered accurately, allowing you to harness the full potential of the XAML Designer.\nIf you have feedback about the XAML Designer, please let us know by using the Visual Studio Feedback Tool.

We encourage you to report bugs and suggest features via the issue tracker on our GitHub repo, where you can also find extension samples to help you get started.\nWhat’s new for VisualStudio.Extensibility?\nOur 17.11 release of VisualStudio.Extensibility includes the following features:\nCustomize your extensions further with settings support\nShow images and use context menus in Remote UI\nEnhance your tool windows with toolbars\nWe’ve also refreshed and updated the project query API documentation based on feedback from extension developers like you!\nCustomize your extensions further with settings support\nWith this release of VisualStudio.Extensibility, we’ve enabled a handful of APIs that allow you to define settings for your extensions. This allows your end users to alter the behavior of the extension by adjusting values you’ve elected to define as settings.\nIn order to support this scenario, you’ll now find APIs specific to defining, accessing, and writing settings in your extension. To add settings to your extension, first add a definition for your setting in a class in the extension.\nIf you’d like to learn more about how to define and leverage settings in your apps, refer to the VisualStudio.Extensibility settings article. You’ll find more details along with samples to get you coding quickly!\nNote that the settings API, like VisualStudio.Extensibility, supports Hot Loading of settings. This allows your extension’s settings to be discovered without requiring your users to restart Visual Studio.\nShow images and use context menus in Remote UI\nAs the VisualStudio.Extensibility model prioritizes extensions running outside of the Visual Studio process, it introduces a challenge when adding UI support to extensions as most UI frameworks are in-process. To get around this, there is a set of classes called Remote UI that allow you to define WPF controls in an out-of-process extension and then show them as part of the Visual Studio UI.\nWith this release, you can now add a context menu to a Remote UI control from XAML, a familiar experience if you’ve ever added a context menu in standard WPF. You’ll also be able to use Remote UI XAML to show either custom images or images that already exist in the Visual Studio catalog. This gives you additional options for providing users with useful information in a visual format and can help you increase your extension’s UI appeal!\nVisit the Other Remote UI concepts documentation for code samples and more information.\nEnhance your tool windows with toolbars\nYou can now use VisualStudio.Extensibility to add toolbars to your extension’s tool windows to give your users a quick and easy way to access or leverage features in your extension.\nSee the Add a toolbar to a tool window section in the tool window overview doc to learn more about creating, adding content to, showing, and controlling the visibility of tool windows – and of course to learn more about adding toolbars to those tool windows.\nProject Query API documentation updates\nIn response to your valuable feedback, we have revamped our documentation to better serve your needs. As we transition to a new model, our project query documentation is evolving to leverage VisualStudio.Extensibility project query wrappers for accessing and modifying solutions/projects. To explore the updated documentation, please refer to Query the Project API (VisualStudio.Extensibility). For details specific to project query using Visual Studio SDK, you can visit Query the Project API (Visual Studio SDK).\nAbout experimental APIs, breaking changes, and how we make decisions about VisualStudio.Extensibility\nIn reviewing feedback from our issue tracker, we realized it would be useful to outline information about some of the decisions we’ve made around VisualStudio.Extensibility. With this new extensibility model, we carefully consider exactly what should and should not be supported based on two major criteria: your feedback and the design goals of the project. One recent example: we decided not to support the ability to programmatically invoke VSCT (Visual Studio Command Table)-based commands via VisualStudio.Extensibility. This decision aligned with established principles for VisualStudio.Extensibility for a few reasons:\nVSCT based commands are synchronous. VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions operate asynchronously in a separate process.\nAs there’s no guarantee that UI state will remain coherent due to the asynchronous nature of the invocation from another process or thread, allowing invocation could lead to unpredictable user experiences.\nVSCT-based commands allow input and output of any type. VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions can run out of process. This imposes limitations around the types of input and output data that can be serialized.\nDirect command invocation breaks our commitment to having consistent, easy-to-use APIs as it would essentially introduce another set of APIs that are more macro/script-like.\nAs we continue increasing the surface area of the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK, we’ll rely on this framework to inform decisions on API coverage and availability. The API is growing and changing. We aim to minimize breaking changes and ensure stability and a consistent experience for you, our extension developers. When we make changes because of customer feedback or internal changes, we’ll communicate it formally with plenty of notice on the VisualStudio.Extensibility breaking changes page. We’ll use the following guidelines for breaking changes to experimental APIs:\nBreaking changes can be made as part of LTSC minor version releases of Visual Studio.\n\nA list of breaking changes for the release will be shared by Preview 2 of that release.\nThe list will be shared in the breaking changes doc linked above.\nRemoval of APIs may be formally deprecated by marking the type or by using the [Obsolete] attribute.\n\nThis will also happen by Preview 2 of the release in which they’ll be removed.\nMost APIs in VisualStudio.Extensibility are stable, which means we do not plan to make any breaking changes to them. For these, we want to replicate the stability expectations associated with the existing VS SDK:\nBreaking changes to VisualStudio.Extensibility APIs or RPC contracts will only happen as part of a major version release of Visual Studio.\n\nThe list of breaking changes will be available by Preview 1 of the release.\nAny API removal will happen formally by marking the type or by using the [Obsolete] attribute.\nDemotion of stable APIs to experimental is considered a breaking change and will be formally announced.\nWe can’t do this without you!\nThe time and effort you’ve spent reporting issues and sharing suggestions so far has been instrumental in shaping VisualStudio.Extensibility. We need your help as we continue to develop VisualStudio.Extensibility! Please try out this preview release and let us know what you think. Check out the docs, browse the code samples, and build your first extension. You can send feedback and report issues through our issue tracker.\nTo request features, look at Developer Community to see if someone else made a similar request first. Create a new one if you can’t find a similar request. By checking for similar requests and upvoting and commenting on them, you help us better prioritize requests.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "From search to organization, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made it easier for Dropbox users to discover and interact with their files. However, these advancements can also introduce new security challenges. Large Language Models (LLMs), integral to some of our most recent intelligent features, are also susceptible to various threats—from data breaches and adversarial attacks to exploitation by malicious actors. While hundreds of millions of users already trust Dropbox to protect their content, ensuring the security and integrity of these models is essential for maintaining that trust.\nLast year we evaluated several security solutions to help safeguard our LLM-powered applications and ultimately chose Lakera Guard. With its robust capabilities, Lakera Guard helps us secure and protect user data, and—as outlined in our AI principles—uphold the reliability and trustworthiness of our intelligent features.\nAddressing these challenges requires a multifaceted approach, incorporating stringent security protocols, continuous monitoring, and proactive risk management strategies. In this story, we’ll share insights into our approach to securing our LLMs, the criteria we used to evaluate potential solutions, and the key benefits of implementing Lakera's technology.\n\r\n\r\n    \n What we were looking for\n\r\n\r\n\n\nLLM security is comprised of many parts. Common problems include reliability, consistency, alignment, and adversarial attacks. However, the scope of the problem we were trying to solve was more customer-centric—specifically, using LLMs to chat about, summarize, transcribe, and retrieve information, in addition to agent/assistant use cases. These kinds of untrusted user inputs could result in moderation issues or prompt injection—a method sometimes used to manipulate models—which creates a lot of headaches, including undesirable model outputs.\nWe considered a variety of open source, in-house, and proprietary options before narrowing our criteria to either open source or commercial tools. Whatever we chose, we decided the following requirements were mandatory:\nWe couldn’t call out to a third party. The solution had to be deployable in-house on our existing infrastructure.\nLow latency. Dropbox is committed to maximizing performance for users across all of its products. We couldn’t add latency to LLM-powered features any more than absolutely necessary, so we determined upper latency numbers with the product teams.\nLatency for a given context length is also an important sub-problem here. Many options perform well on context lengths of 4,000. Excellent support for long context lengths—the ability for models to process greater amounts of information—was critical, as many customer use cases routinely exceed this number.\nConfidence scores. API integrations that not only allowed extensive control over the categories of blocking, but also the sensitivity, were key (eg., separating the danger classification jailbreak based on confidence scores in order to ensure we could meet the diverse needs of our product teams).\nFuture intelligence and continuous improvement. Since LLM security is a fast evolving space, we wanted a solution that could also give us actionable insights into attacks and payloads in a rapidly shifting environment.\nIn fact, given the rapidly shifting environment, our top priority was selecting a solution that gave us enough of a foothold to observe and reorient as needed.\n\r\n\r\n    \n How we tested\n\r\n\r\n\n\nOnce we had a short list of open-source and commercial tools that met our criteria, we set up each tool internally for evaluation. For our test suite, we used Garak, an open-source LLM vulnerability scanner customized to run Dropbox-specific security tests. With Garak, we could evaluate the security coverage of each of the potential solutions. This allowed us to conduct a range of tests involving prompt injection, jailbreak, and other security assessments developed by Dropbox. \nWe then tested each solution directly against a range of LLMs already in use or under evaluation by our product teams. This enabled us to establish a baseline of each model’s vulnerability. For example, if a security tool blocked 90% of malicious prompts, but the LLM had already mitigated 85% of these vulnerabilities, we measured a net improvement of only 5%.\nFinally, we needed a tool that did not add excessive latency to LLM calls and respected the privacy of customer data (e.g., did not store prompt content or send it outside the Dropbox network). For this, we measured the response time of each security test and also monitored network requests and file changes to detect any potential breaches of user data.\nAfter extensive testing, Lakera Guard emerged as the product meeting all our requirements, offering both the lowest latency and highest security coverage.\n\r\n\r\n    \n How we integrated Lakera Guard\n\r\n\r\n\n\nLakera provides a Docker container that we run as an internal service at Dropbox. This means Lakera Guard is just an RPC call away from any LLM pipeline. Conceptually, the LLM security architecture at Dropbox is designed using LangChain as shown in the figure below. \n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/lakera/lakera-diagram1.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/lakera/lakera-diagram1.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1446\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5b8c124b-6ee0-4211-98be-e604d783ae92:lakera-diagram1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/lakera/lakera-diagram1.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/lakera/lakera-diagram1.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1446\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5b8c124b-6ee0-4211-98be-e604d783ae92:lakera-diagram1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nA high-level representation of the internal AI/ML security infrastructure at Dropbox\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nHere, a textual LLM prompt is directed through one or more prompt security chains before hitting the model. We have a security chain that makes Lakera Guard security API endpoint requests to our internally-hosted Docker container, which responds with confidence scores for prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Dropbox services can then action on the returned Lakera Guard prompt security categories as appropriate for the application. \nPrompts that are deemed to be safe are then passed to the LLM—either a third-party model, like GPT-4, or an internally hosted open-source model, like LLaMA 3, depending on the use case—which produces a textual response. The LLM’s response is then passed through our content moderation chains, which analyze the text for potentially harmful topics. The moderation chain calls out to Lakera’s content moderation API endpoint to identify harassing or explicit content that the Dropbox feature or service can withhold from the user as configured.\nIntegrating Lakera Guard into our Dropbox infrastructure was a gradual process. We started with one product directly calling the Lakera-provided Docker container. Eventually, we created a custom Dropbox service that can automatically scale up more containers as needed—and can be called via the LLM security layer we built as part of Dropbox’s central machine learning libraries.\n\r\n\r\n    \n What we learned, and what’s next\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThroughout this process, several product teams had concerns about latency—especially since many LLM use cases at Dropbox have prompts of more than 8,000 characters. We worked closely with Lakera to minimize added latency as much as possible, and our current average latency is now a 7x improvement for prompts with more than 8,000 characters.\nOur belief in Lakera is so strong that we've invested in its continued success and have collaborated with its teams on numerous improvements to Lakera Guard itself. We found novel ways to cause LLM hallucination and collaborated with Lakera to increase efficacy for malicious prompt detection. We also shared internal research—such as our work on repeated token attacks—as well as some interesting false positives.\nFinally, by working closely with the machine learning and product teams, we were able to help them meet their requirements while also achieving our security goals. For example, some of the false positives we encountered were a result of poor user input sanitization—or the process of filtering any potentially harmful or unwanted characters—which we were able to pass back to the product teams for improvement. Lakera has also been very interested in understanding our product flows to ensure they’re delivering a product that meets us where we are. \nWe’re currently planning to expand our Lakera Guard integration to all products using LLMs at Dropbox. This will involve tuning the detections for each use case and determining other potential causes of false positives or high latencies that can occur with some of the different data structures currently in use.\nOne of our core commitments at Dropbox is being worthy of our customers' trust. Partnering with Lakera to protect our users and their data is a testament to this promise. There are also many more interesting problems yet to be solved, and we plan to share more about how our approach to LLM security continues to evolve in future posts.\n~ ~ ~\nIf building innovative products, experiences, and infrastructure excites you, come build the future with us!

This allows app developers to select what API functionality their apps can use, so that users can feel more comfortable granting apps access to their accounts. This can help give users peace of mind that the apps will only be able to perform the operations that the apps actually need. It may not be obvious though that you can further customize exactly which scopes your app requests and when. Let's look at the options for configuring and customizing scopes in more detail.\n\nFirst, it's important to note that the scopes you enable on the Permissions tab of the app's page on the App Console define the maximum, as well as the default, set of scopes that the app can request.

In that parameter, you can put a space-delimited list of scopes to specify just a sub-set of scopes to request for that authorization. This can be useful in scenarios where the app doesn't need all of the app's potential access, or as a way to more gradually gain the user's trust.\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=&response_type=code&scope=files.metadata.read\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-subset.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-subset.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"A screenshot of the app authorization page requesting a sub-set of the scopes registered to the app.\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"776\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"455\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"dff648aa-f841-43b0-bde1-a88c9c56d94b:authorize-subset.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-subset.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-subset.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"776\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"455\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"dff648aa-f841-43b0-bde1-a88c9c56d94b:authorize-subset.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nA screenshot of the app authorization page requesting a sub-set of the scopes registered to the app.\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nTip: Note how even though account_info.read is required to be enabled on the app itself, you don't have to request it during authorization. For more privacy-oriented scenarios where the app doesn't need access to the user's account information, you can set the scope parameter without the account_info.read scope as above. \nIf a user authorizes the app using that /oauth2/authorize URL, the app will then receive a payload like the following when it subsequently makes the corresponding call to /oauth2/token using the resulting authorization code:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \n\r\n{\r\n  \"access_token\": \"\",\r\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\r\n  \"expires_in\": 14400,\r\n  \"scope\": \"files.metadata.read\",\r\n  \"uid\": \"\",\r\n  \"account_id\": \"\"\r\n}\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\nIf the app needs additional scopes later, it can prompt the user to authorize the app again, with the scope parameter configured with more scopes, or without the scope parameter set at all, to request all of the app’s scopes.\n\nYou can also use the include_granted_scopes parameter to make it easier to request additional scopes without explicitly listing the previously granted scopes again. For example, if we then additionally want the app to be able to read the content of files in that same user’s account, we would construct another URL like this:\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=&response_type=code&scope=files.content.read&include_granted_scopes=user\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-additional.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-additional.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"A screenshot of the app authorization page requesting additional scopes registered to the app.\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"776\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"455\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"e0f65b7d-dac5-4075-a187-7a56e168ca8d:authorize-additional.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-additional.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2024/09/customizing-scopes/authorize-additional.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"776\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"455\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"e0f65b7d-dac5-4075-a187-7a56e168ca8d:authorize-additional.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nA screenshot of the app authorization page requesting additional scopes registered to the app.\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nIf the user authorizes the app using that /oauth2/authorize URL, the app will then receive a payload like the following when it subsequently makes the corresponding call to /oauth2/token using the resulting authorization code:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \n\r\n{\r\n  \"access_token\": \"\",\r\n  \"token_type\": \"bearer\",\r\n  \"expires_in\": 14400,\r\n  \"scope\": \"files.content.read files.metadata.read\",\r\n  \"uid\": \"\",\r\n  \"account_id\": \"\"\r\n}\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\nNote how this time, the access token has permission to both files.metadata.read as well as files.content.read.\nour \"Using OAuth 2.0 with offline access\" blog post for information on that.\nforum or via our contact form.",

        "content": "\n            \n            &lt;p&gt;Apache Flink를 처음 접하신 분이나 간단한 예제를 작성해보고 싶은 분들을 위해 작성한 글이에요. Architecture를 포함한 자세한 내부 동작 방식은 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Flink 공식 문서&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;를 참고해주시길 바랄게요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;apache-flink&quot;&gt;Apache Flink&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;stateful-computations-over-data-streams&quot;&gt;Stateful Computations over Data Streams&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/&quot;&gt;Apache Flink(이하 Flink)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;는 데이터 스트리밍 및 배치 처리용 오픈 소스 프레임워크입니다. 비슷하게 데이터 스트리밍이나 배치 프로세싱을 위해 Kafka Streams, Spark, Kinesis 등이 있는데요, Flink 공식 홈페이지에 들어가면 먼저 Catchphrase가 눈에 들어옵니다. &lt;strong&gt;Stateful Computations over Data Streams&lt;/strong&gt;. 왜 이 문구를 강조하고 있을까요?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/apache-flink.png&quot; alt=&quot;Apache Flink&quot; title=&quot;Apache Flink&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;스트림(Stream)&lt;/strong&gt;이란 &lt;strong&gt;특정 시점에 일어난 이벤트의 연속&lt;/strong&gt;을 의미합니다. 예를 들어, 온도, 습도 등의 데이터를 실시간으로 수집하는 IoT 디바이스에서는 변화하는 온도와 습도가 스트림으로 구성될 수 있어요. 사용자가 앱에서 특정 버튼을 클릭한다던가 피드에서 스크롤을 하는 등의 행동 데이터들도 스트림으로 구성될 수 있습니다. 이처럼 스트림은 특정 시점에 일어나는 작고 독립된 변하지 않는 불변 객체입니다. 입력 데이터가 고정된 크기의 데이터 셋으로 제공되는 &lt;strong&gt;배치 처리(Batch Processing)&lt;/strong&gt;와 다르게, 스트림 처리는(Stream Processing)은 입력 데이터가 지속적으로 발생하고 이걸 실시간으로 처리하는게 목표예요. Flink는 단순히 쏟아지는 데이터를 처리하는걸 목표로 하지 않고, 세션 윈도우(Session Window, 특정 시간 동안의 사용자 활동)나 집계(Aggregation, 평균, 총합 등) 등 &lt;strong&gt;메모리 내에서 상태를 유지하고 관리&lt;/strong&gt;할 수 있는 강력한 기능을 제공합니다. 웹 애플리케이션에서 사용자가 다양한 페이지를 방문하는 동안 각 사용자의 세션을 실시간으로 추적한다던가, 결제 시스템에서 실시간으로 거래 데이터를 모니터링하고 특정 패턴을 찾아 이상 거래를 탐지하는 등 실시간으로 발생하는 스트림 데이터에서 상태를 유지하면서 연산을 수행할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다. 그리고 Flink의 상태 관리 기능 덕분에 애플리케이션 개발자는 이 도구를 활용해서 다양한 실시간 애플리케이션을 구축하고 쉽게 운영할 수 있게 되었습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;도구를 잘 쓰려면 이 도구가 어떻게 돌아가는지, 그리고 어디에 쓰는 것이고 어떻게 쓰는 건지 아는게 중요하기 때문에 &lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-architecture/&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/a&gt;와 &lt;a href=&quot;https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-applications/&quot;&gt;API&lt;/a&gt;도 참고하시면 좋겠어요. Flink 학습을 위해 온라인 강의도 들어봤는데 아직까지는 공식 문서가 최고라 생각해요. 여기서 따로 설명은 하지 않겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/flink-task-manager.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flink Task Manager&quot; title=&quot;Flink Task Manager&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;Flink Runtime Flow&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages&quot;&gt;Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제가 서버 개발자니.. 개발자 관점에서 Flink의 가장 대표적인 특징을 꼽으라면 &lt;strong&gt;Standalone&lt;/strong&gt;과 &lt;strong&gt;Checkpoints&lt;/strong&gt;를 이야기하고 싶습니다. 일례로 데이터 스트리밍에 많이 활용되는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/&quot;&gt;Apache Kafka Streams&lt;/a&gt;은 애플리케이션의 일부로 실행되는 라이브러리인 반면, Flink는 자체 스트림 처리 엔진을 가지고 있는 프레임워크라서 독립적으로 배포와 실행이 가능합니다. IDEA에서 코드만 작성해서 실행하면 내장된 Mini Cluster를 기반으로 쉽게 디버깅까지 할 수 있습니다. 그리고 체크포인트(Checkpoints)를 통해 애플리케이션의 상태를 주기적으로 저장하여 장애 발생시 자동으로 복구해줍니다(Fault-tolerance). 정확히 한 번만(Exactly-Once) 처리한다던가 Two-Phase Commit 기반의 원자적 커밋을 통해 데이터 일관성을 보장할 수도 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그리고 하나만 더 꼽으라면 데이터 프로세싱을 위한 고수준의 API에 대해서 이야기하고 싶어요. &lt;a href=&quot;https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html&quot;&gt;Spark RDD&lt;/a&gt;를 다뤄 보신 분들이라면 아주 쉽게 사용해볼 수 있을거라 생각해요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/spark-flink-operator.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flink Task Manager&quot; title=&quot;Flink Task Manager&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 Operator들은 Spark RDD를 모르더라도 Java나 Kotlin을 사용하거나 함수형 프로그래밍의 고차 함수(Higher-order Functions)에 익숙한 분들이라면 쉽게 접근할 수 있을거라 생각합니다. 쉴 새 없이 들어오는 데이터 스트림을 다른 형태로 변환하고 싶을때에는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;과 같은 함수를 이용해서 새로운 데이터 스트림으로 변환하고, 특정 조건에 만족하는 데이터만 필터링하고 싶다면 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; 함수를 사용하면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-kotlin highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 입력 데이터 스트림 생성&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;py&quot;&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;DataStream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;env&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fromElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Filter: 짝수인 요소만 필터링&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;

alt=&quot;Event-driven Applications&quot; title=&quot;Event-driven Applications&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;Flink support event-driven applications&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/flink-usecases-analytics.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Analytics Applications&quot; title=&quot;Data Analytics Applications&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;Flink support data analytics applications&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/flink-usecases-datapipelines.png&quot; alt=&quot;Data Pipeline Applications&quot; title=&quot;Data Pipeline Applications&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;Flink support data pipelines&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;잠깐 아주 간단한 예시 하나를 살펴볼게요. 사용자의 요청을 받아서 처리하는 웹 서버가 Database(DB)에 쓰기를 하면서 동시에 검색을 위해 Elastic Search(ES)에도 데이터를 적재한다고 가정해볼게요. 이 때 DB의 쓰기 연산과 ES로의 쓰기 연산이 서로 원자적으로 묶일 수 없다면 어떤 문제가 생길까요? DB에 쓰기는 성공하고 ES에 쓰기는 실패했으면, 사용자가 게시글을 쓰는데에 성공했지만 검색에는 노출이 안되는 문제가 발생할거에요. 그래서 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해 DB 쓰기와 ES 쓰기를 Kafka와 같은 이벤트 브로커를 활용해서 분리하는 전략을 취할 수 있어요. 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해 다양한 방법이 존재하는데, Flink로는 어떻게 해결할 수 있는지 살펴볼게요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/sync-es.png&quot; alt=&quot;Sync Elastic Search&quot; title=&quot;Sync Elastic Search&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;별도 Worker를 통해 ES 데이터 적재&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Flink 생태계에서 인기 있는 것 중 하나는 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-cdc-docs-release-3.2/&quot;&gt;Flink CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;입니다. Flink CDC는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://debezium.io/&quot;&gt;Debezium&lt;/a&gt;을 기반으로 데이터베이스의 변경 로그를 실시간으로 캡쳐해서 타겟 시스템으로 반영할 수 있게 도와주는 도구입니다. &lt;strong&gt;사용자가 DB에 쓰기 연산을 실행하면 Flink CDC가 변경 사항을 캡쳐해서 Kafka에 데이터 변경점을 기록하고, Flink 앱에서 변경점을 받아 변환을 한 다음 ES에 데이터를 적재&lt;/strong&gt;합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/flink-cdc-usage.png&quot; alt=&quot;Flink CDC Usage&quot; title=&quot;Flink CDC Usage&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;center&gt;Flink CDC 기반 ES 데이터 적재&lt;/center&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kafka와 같은 이벤트 브로커를 중심으로 ES 쓰기를 실행하니, 언뜻 보기엔 바로 위에서 이야기한 ‘ES 적재를 이벤트 기반으로 분리’와 별반 다르지 않아 보입니다. 그런데 Flink 기반으로 문제를 해결할 때 취할 수 있는 장점은 위에서 잠깐 이야기한 체크포인트(Checkpoint)를 활용할 수 있다는 것입니다. 장애 복구 관점에서 Worker에서 ES 쓰기를 어디까지 했는지 별도 저장소에 관리를 해야 할 필요가 있는데, Flink 기반의 데이터 처리는 체크포인트와 상태 관리를 통해 장애 복구 뿐만 아니라 데이터의 일관성 보장을 높일 수 있습니다. 복잡한 상태 관리와 장애 복구 등의 작업은 플랫폼(라이브러리나 프레임워크)에 적절히 위임하고, 엔지니어는 이런 도구를 잘 활용하여 어떤 가치를 창출할 수 있을지에 집중하는게 중요합니다. 이런 고민과 선택은 사용자에게 일관된 최상의 경험을 제공하는 길로 이어질 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;여기서 살펴본 건 하나의 예시일 뿐, 중요한 건 &lt;strong&gt;&apos;흐르는 데이터에 어떤 빨때를 꽂아서 어디에 활용해 볼 수 있을까?&apos;&lt;/strong&gt;라는 질문을 가지고 계속해서 고민하는 것입니다. 관습적으로 배치 잡을 사용해 처리하던 작업들을 스트리밍 애플리케이션으로 전환해서 처리할 수는 없을까요? 만약 데이터 처리를 위해 Spring Batch 부터 떠올린다면 Stream Processing도 함께 살펴보시길 추천할게요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;quickstart&quot;&gt;Quickstart&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apache Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하기 위해서는 먼저 Flink Cluster 환경 구축이 필요합니다. 클러스터를 통해 데이터를 병렬 처리하거나 내결함성을 제공해 데이터를 효율적으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 그리고 애플리케이션을 실행한다는 말은 Flink에 정의한 Job을 실행한다는 의미이기도 합니다. Cluster에는 실행 가능한 Jar 파일을 제출하면 되는데, 자바 애플리케이션 코드를 작성해서 빌드한 결과로 나온 Jar 파일을 제출하면 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Production 환경에서 Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하려면 &lt;a href=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/managed-service-apache-flink/&quot;&gt;Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink&lt;/a&gt; 같은 솔루션을 써도 되고, &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-stable/docs/try-flink-kubernetes-operator/quick-start/&quot;&gt;Flink Kubernetes Operator&lt;/a&gt;를 이용해서 Kubernetes 위에서 Flink Cluster와 Job을 배포하고 관리할 수 있습니다. 여기서는 Mac OS 환경의 로컬 PC에서 Apache Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하는 여러 방법을 살펴보겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-idea에서-프로그램-실행&quot;&gt;1. IDEA에서 프로그램 실행&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;가장 편하고 유용한 방법은 IntelliJ IDEA에서 main 함수를 바로 실행하는 것입니다. Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하려면 Cluster에 실행 가능한 Jar 파일을 제출해야 되는데, IDEA에서 버튼만 누르면 바로 실행이 되고 디버깅까지 되니 신기할 따름입니다. 그 이유는 Apache Flink에서는 로컬 환경에서 Flink Cluster를 에뮬레이션할 수 있게끔 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/minicluster/MiniCluster.java&quot;&gt;MiniCluster&lt;/a&gt;를 제공하기 때문입니다. 그래서 Flink 애플리케이션을 만드는 개발자는 실제 클러스터를 구축할 필요 없이 로컬 환경에서 Flink Cluster에 앱을 실행하는 것처럼 시뮬레이션을 할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-flink-run-application.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Run Application&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Run Application&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-local-flink-cluster-구축&quot;&gt;2. Local Flink Cluster 구축&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;또 다른 방법은 직접 Flink Cluster를 로컬 환경에 구축해서 사용하는 것입니다. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/try-flink/local_installation/&quot;&gt;Apache Flink 공식 문서&lt;/a&gt;에서 Local Cluster를 구축할 수 있는 가이드를 제공하고 있습니다. Binary Release를 다운 받아서 압축을 푼 다음 아래 명령어를 실행해서 Flink Cluster를 시작하고 Jar 파일을 실행시켜서 Job을 제출할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Flink Cluser 중지\n$ ./bin/stop-cluster.sh\n\n# Flink Cluser 시작\n$ ./bin/start-cluster.sh\n\n# Flink Cluster에 Flink Job 제출(실행)\n$ ./bin/flink run examples/streaming/WordCount.jar\n\n# Flink Cluster 로그 확인\n$ tail -f log/flink-*\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-1-idea에-flink-plugin-설치&quot;&gt;2-1. IDEA에 Flink Plugin 설치&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IntelliJ IDEA에서 Big Data Tools 플러그인 번들로 함께 사용할 수 있는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/21702-flink&quot;&gt;Flink Plugin&lt;/a&gt;을 제공합니다. 이 플러그인을 사용하면 Flink Cluster를 모니터링하거나 직접 Flink Job을 제출할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-settings-flink.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Settings&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Settings&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-settings-flink-test-connection.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Test Connection&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Test Connection&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-2-local-cluster에-jar-제출&quot;&gt;2-2. Local Cluster에 Jar 제출&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;IDEA에 생성된 Flink Console에서 Submit New Job 클릭후 + 버튼을 누르면 빌드된 Jar 파일을 선택할 수 있습니다. Jar 파일을 선택하고 나서 실행(Run) 버튼을 클릭하면 Flink Cluster에 Jar 파일이 제출되고 정상이라면 Job이 실행됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-flink-submit-new-job.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Submit New Job&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Submit New Job&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-flink-run-jar.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Run Jar&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Run Jar&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/09/18/idea-flink-run-jar-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;IDEA Run Jar&quot; title=&quot;IDEA Run Jar&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-3-local-cluster-모니터링&quot;&gt;2-3.

문자열을 출력하는 것인데, 데이터 프로세싱에서는 단어 개수를 세는 Word Count를 입문용 예제로 다루고 있습니다. 여기서는 Flink를 활용해 문자열에 포함된 특정 단어들의 개수를 출력하는 Word Count Job을 만들어보겠습니다. 전체 코드는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sungjk/flink-hello-world&quot;&gt;Github - flink-hello-world&lt;/a&gt;에서 확인할 수 있어요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=&quot;language-kotlin highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;

Architecture를 포함한 자세한 내부 동작 방식은 <strong><a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\">Apache Flink 공식 문서</a></strong>를 참고해주시길 바랄게요.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"apache-flink\">Apache Flink</h1>\n\n<h3 id=\"stateful-computations-over-data-streams\">Stateful Computations over Data Streams</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Flink has been designed to run in all common cluster environments, perform computations at in-memory speed and at any scale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\">Apache Flink(이하 Flink)</a></strong>는 데이터 스트리밍 및 배치 처리용 오픈 소스 프레임워크입니다. 비슷하게 데이터 스트리밍이나 배치 프로세싱을 위해 Kafka Streams, Spark, Kinesis 등이 있는데요, Flink 공식 홈페이지에 들어가면 먼저 Catchphrase가 눈에 들어옵니다. <strong>Stateful Computations over Data Streams</strong>. 왜 이 문구를 강조하고 있을까요?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/apache-flink.png\" alt=\"Apache Flink\" title=\"Apache Flink\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>스트림(Stream)</strong>이란 <strong>특정 시점에 일어난 이벤트의 연속</strong>을 의미합니다. 예를 들어, 온도, 습도 등의 데이터를 실시간으로 수집하는 IoT 디바이스에서는 변화하는 온도와 습도가 스트림으로 구성될 수 있어요. 사용자가 앱에서 특정 버튼을 클릭한다던가 피드에서 스크롤을 하는 등의 행동 데이터들도 스트림으로 구성될 수 있습니다. 이처럼 스트림은 특정 시점에 일어나는 작고 독립된 변하지 않는 불변 객체입니다. 입력 데이터가 고정된 크기의 데이터 셋으로 제공되는 <strong>배치 처리(Batch Processing)</strong>와 다르게, 스트림 처리는(Stream Processing)은 입력 데이터가 지속적으로 발생하고 이걸 실시간으로 처리하는게 목표예요. Flink는 단순히 쏟아지는 데이터를 처리하는걸 목표로 하지 않고, 세션 윈도우(Session Window, 특정 시간 동안의 사용자 활동)나 집계(Aggregation, 평균, 총합 등) 등 <strong>메모리 내에서 상태를 유지하고 관리</strong>할 수 있는 강력한 기능을 제공합니다. 웹 애플리케이션에서 사용자가 다양한 페이지를 방문하는 동안 각 사용자의 세션을 실시간으로 추적한다던가, 결제 시스템에서 실시간으로 거래 데이터를 모니터링하고 특정 패턴을 찾아 이상 거래를 탐지하는 등 실시간으로 발생하는 스트림 데이터에서 상태를 유지하면서 연산을 수행할 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다. 그리고 Flink의 상태 관리 기능 덕분에 애플리케이션 개발자는 이 도구를 활용해서 다양한 실시간 애플리케이션을 구축하고 쉽게 운영할 수 있게 되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>도구를 잘 쓰려면 이 도구가 어떻게 돌아가는지, 그리고 어디에 쓰는 것이고 어떻게 쓰는 건지 아는게 중요하기 때문에 <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-architecture/\">Architecture</a>와 <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-applications/\">API</a>도 참고하시면 좋겠어요. Flink 학습을 위해 온라인 강의도 들어봤는데 아직까지는 공식 문서가 최고라 생각해요. 여기서 따로 설명은 하지 않겠습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/flink-task-manager.png\" alt=\"Flink Task Manager\" title=\"Flink Task Manager\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<center>Flink Runtime Flow</center>\n\n<h3 id=\"advantages\">Advantages</h3>\n\n<p>제가 서버 개발자니.. 개발자 관점에서 Flink의 가장 대표적인 특징을 꼽으라면 <strong>Standalone</strong>과 <strong>Checkpoints</strong>를 이야기하고 싶습니다. 일례로 데이터 스트리밍에 많이 활용되는 <a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams/\">Apache Kafka Streams</a>은 애플리케이션의 일부로 실행되는 라이브러리인 반면, Flink는 자체 스트림 처리 엔진을 가지고 있는 프레임워크라서 독립적으로 배포와 실행이 가능합니다. IDEA에서 코드만 작성해서 실행하면 내장된 Mini Cluster를 기반으로 쉽게 디버깅까지 할 수 있습니다. 그리고 체크포인트(Checkpoints)를 통해 애플리케이션의 상태를 주기적으로 저장하여 장애 발생시 자동으로 복구해줍니다(Fault-tolerance). 정확히 한 번만(Exactly-Once) 처리한다던가 Two-Phase Commit 기반의 원자적 커밋을 통해 데이터 일관성을 보장할 수도 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그리고 하나만 더 꼽으라면 데이터 프로세싱을 위한 고수준의 API에 대해서 이야기하고 싶어요. <a href=\"https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html\">Spark RDD</a>를 다뤄 보신 분들이라면 아주 쉽게 사용해볼 수 있을거라 생각해요.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/spark-flink-operator.png\" alt=\"Flink Task Manager\" title=\"Flink Task Manager\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>이 Operator들은 Spark RDD를 모르더라도 Java나 Kotlin을 사용하거나 함수형 프로그래밍의 고차 함수(Higher-order Functions)에 익숙한 분들이라면 쉽게 접근할 수 있을거라 생각합니다. 쉴 새 없이 들어오는 데이터 스트림을 다른 형태로 변환하고 싶을때에는 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">map</code>과 같은 함수를 이용해서 새로운 데이터 스트림으로 변환하고, 특정 조건에 만족하는 데이터만 필터링하고 싶다면 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">filter</code> 함수를 사용하면 됩니다.</p>\n\n<div

Cases</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-stable/\">Apache Flink Documentation</a>을 살펴보면 Source와 Sink라는 용어가 많이 보이는데, Apache Flink 뿐만 아니라 데이터 엔지니어링에서 흔히 사용되는 용어입니다. <strong>Source는 데이터 파이프라인의 시작 지점</strong>으로, 데이터를 수집하여 시스템에 입력하는 역할을 합니다. <strong>Sink는 데이터 파이프라인의 종료 지점</strong>으로, 데이터를 외부 시스템으로 출력하여 저장하거나 전송하는 역할을 합니다. 데이터 소스(Source)와 데이터 싱크(Sink)로서 외부 시스템과 데이터를 주고 받을 수 있도록 여러 Connector를 제공하고 있어요. 현재(2024.09.18) 기준으로 아래와 같은 Source, Sink Connector를 제공하고 있습니다. 이 내용은 <a

데이터 파이프라인에 구축의 기반을 다지는데 사용될 수 있다고 말하고 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/flink-usecases-eventdrivenapps.png\" alt=\"Event-driven Applications\" title=\"Event-driven Applications\"

서버가 Database(DB)에 쓰기를 하면서 동시에 검색을 위해 Elastic Search(ES)에도 데이터를 적재한다고 가정해볼게요. 이 때 DB의 쓰기 연산과 ES로의 쓰기 연산이 서로 원자적으로 묶일 수 없다면 어떤 문제가 생길까요? DB에 쓰기는 성공하고 ES에 쓰기는 실패했으면, 사용자가 게시글을 쓰는데에 성공했지만 검색에는 노출이 안되는 문제가 발생할거에요. 그래서 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해 DB 쓰기와 ES 쓰기를 Kafka와 같은 이벤트 브로커를 활용해서 분리하는 전략을 취할 수 있어요. 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해 다양한 방법이 존재하는데, Flink로는 어떻게 해결할 수 있는지 살펴볼게요.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/sync-es.png\" alt=\"Sync Elastic Search\" title=\"Sync Elastic Search\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<center>별도 Worker를 통해 ES 데이터 적재</center>\n\n<p>Flink 생태계에서 인기 있는 것 중 하나는 <strong><a href=\"https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-cdc-docs-release-3.2/\">Flink CDC</a></strong>입니다. Flink CDC는 <a href=\"https://debezium.io/\">Debezium</a>을 기반으로 데이터베이스의 변경 로그를 실시간으로 캡쳐해서 타겟 시스템으로 반영할 수 있게 도와주는 도구입니다. <strong>사용자가 DB에 쓰기 연산을 실행하면 Flink CDC가 변경 사항을 캡쳐해서 Kafka에 데이터 변경점을 기록하고, Flink 앱에서 변경점을 받아 변환을 한 다음 ES에 데이터를 적재</strong>합니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/flink-cdc-usage.png\" alt=\"Flink CDC Usage\" title=\"Flink CDC Usage\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<center>Flink CDC 기반 ES 데이터 적재</center>\n\n<p>Kafka와 같은 이벤트 브로커를 중심으로 ES 쓰기를 실행하니, 언뜻 보기엔 바로 위에서 이야기한 ‘ES 적재를 이벤트 기반으로 분리’와 별반 다르지 않아 보입니다. 그런데 Flink 기반으로 문제를 해결할 때 취할 수 있는 장점은 위에서 잠깐 이야기한 체크포인트(Checkpoint)를 활용할 수 있다는 것입니다. 장애 복구 관점에서 Worker에서 ES 쓰기를 어디까지 했는지 별도 저장소에 관리를 해야 할 필요가 있는데, Flink 기반의 데이터 처리는 체크포인트와 상태 관리를 통해 장애 복구 뿐만 아니라 데이터의 일관성 보장을 높일 수 있습니다. 복잡한 상태 관리와 장애 복구 등의 작업은 플랫폼(라이브러리나 프레임워크)에 적절히 위임하고, 엔지니어는 이런 도구를 잘 활용하여 어떤 가치를 창출할 수 있을지에 집중하는게 중요합니다. 이런 고민과 선택은 사용자에게 일관된 최상의 경험을 제공하는 길로 이어질 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>여기서 살펴본 건 하나의 예시일 뿐, 중요한 건 <strong>'흐르는 데이터에 어떤 빨때를 꽂아서 어디에 활용해 볼 수 있을까?'</strong>라는 질문을 가지고 계속해서 고민하는 것입니다. 관습적으로 배치 잡을 사용해 처리하던 작업들을 스트리밍 애플리케이션으로 전환해서 처리할 수는 없을까요? 만약 데이터 처리를 위해 Spring Batch 부터 떠올린다면 Stream Processing도 함께 살펴보시길 추천할게요.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"quickstart\">Quickstart</h1>\n\n<p>Apache Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하기 위해서는 먼저 Flink Cluster 환경 구축이 필요합니다. 클러스터를 통해 데이터를 병렬 처리하거나 내결함성을 제공해 데이터를 효율적으로 처리할 수 있습니다. 그리고 애플리케이션을 실행한다는 말은 Flink에 정의한 Job을 실행한다는 의미이기도 합니다. Cluster에는 실행 가능한 Jar 파일을 제출하면 되는데, 자바 애플리케이션 코드를 작성해서 빌드한 결과로 나온 Jar 파일을 제출하면 됩니다.</p>\n\n<p>Production 환경에서 Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하려면 <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/managed-service-apache-flink/\">Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink</a> 같은 솔루션을 써도 되고, <a href=\"https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-stable/docs/try-flink-kubernetes-operator/quick-start/\">Flink Kubernetes Operator</a>를 이용해서 Kubernetes 위에서 Flink Cluster와 Job을 배포하고 관리할 수 있습니다. 여기서는 Mac OS 환경의 로컬 PC에서 Apache Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하는 여러 방법을 살펴보겠습니다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-idea에서-프로그램-실행\">1. IDEA에서 프로그램 실행</h3>\n\n<p>가장 편하고 유용한 방법은 IntelliJ IDEA에서 main 함수를 바로 실행하는 것입니다. Flink 애플리케이션을 실행하려면 Cluster에 실행 가능한 Jar 파일을 제출해야 되는데, IDEA에서 버튼만 누르면 바로 실행이 되고 디버깅까지 되니 신기할 따름입니다. 그 이유는 Apache Flink에서는 로컬 환경에서 Flink Cluster를 에뮬레이션할 수 있게끔 <a href=\"https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/minicluster/MiniCluster.java\">MiniCluster</a>를 제공하기 때문입니다. 그래서 Flink 애플리케이션을 만드는 개발자는 실제 클러스터를 구축할 필요 없이 로컬 환경에서 Flink Cluster에 앱을 실행하는 것처럼 시뮬레이션을 할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/09/18/idea-flink-run-application.png\" alt=\"IDEA Run Application\" title=\"IDEA Run Application\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-local-flink-cluster-구축\">2. Local Flink Cluster 구축</h3>\n\n<p>또 다른 방법은 직접 Flink Cluster를 로컬 환경에 구축해서 사용하는 것입니다. <a href=\"https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.20/docs/try-flink/local_installation/\">Apache Flink 공식 문서</a>에서 Local Cluster를 구축할 수 있는 가이드를 제공하고 있습니다. Binary Release를 다운 받아서 압축을 푼 다음 아래 명령어를 실행해서 Flink Cluster를 시작하고 Jar 파일을 실행시켜서 Job을 제출할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code># Flink Cluser 중지\n$ ./bin/stop-cluster.sh\n\n# Flink Cluser 시작\n$ ./bin/start-cluster.sh\n\n# Flink Cluster에 Flink Job 제출(실행)\n$ ./bin/flink run examples/streaming/WordCount.jar\n\n# Flink Cluster 로그 확인\n$ tail -f log/flink-*\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-1-idea에-flink-plugin-설치\">2-1.

있는게 정말 많아졌습니다. 단순히 Apache Flink라는 새로운 도구에 익숙해진 건 단편적인 예시일 뿐, 데이터에 대해 눈이 떠졌다랄까요. 데이터 엔지니어 동료와 처음 티타임을 할 때 데이터에 무지한 저의 모습을 스스로 제 3자의 시각에서 바라보고 있는 느낌이 들었고, 머릿속에서는 새로운 터널에 들어서는 것만 같았습니다. 짧게는 3개월, 길게는 1년 뒤에 달라져 있을 제 모습이 상상되기도 했어요. 멋진 동료 덕분에 성장하고 있다는걸 느낄 수 있었고 도움이 필요하면 저도 많이 도와주고 싶다는 생각이 들었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이제 백엔드 엔지니어로서 다룰 수 있는 연장이 하나 더 늘어났습니다. 경계해야 할 건 모든게 다 못으로 보이지 않게 만드는 것. 실시간으로 데이터를 처리할 수 있는 능력이 생겼으니 모든 곳에 다 스트림 앱을 갖다 붙이고 싶을 수 있습니다. 그래서 이 도구로 해결하기에 적당한 문제가 무엇인지 알고 있는게 중요한데요. 처리할 데이터 소스와 싱크를 지원하는지 알아보고, 실시간성(Real-time) 그리고 Window 기반으로 이벤트를 처리해야 할 문제에 Flink를 추천하고 싶습니다. 실시간으로 발생하는 거래 데이터가 정상인지, 이상거래는 아닌지 <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-applications/#state\">State</a>와 <a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/what-is-flink/flink-applications/#time\">Time</a>을 활용해서 판단할 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p>마지막으로, 한국에도 Flink를 사용하는 회사들이 점점 많아지고 있는것 같은데, 기술 교류와 레퍼런스가 많아졌으면 좋겠다는 생각이 들었습니다. 생태계는 계속해서 발전하고 있다는 느낌이 드는데, 대부분 비슷하겠지만 구체적으로 어떤 니즈를 가지고 이 기술을 도입해서 사용하고 있는지가 궁금했습니다. 자주, 더 많은 기술 공유가 있기를!</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"references\">References</h1>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://flink.apache.org/\">Apache Flink</a></li>\n  <li><a

        "contentSnippet": "애플이 발표한 최신 아이폰 16, 하지만 많은 사람들이 기존의 아이폰을 교체할 이유를 찾지 못하고 있습니다. 성능, 배터리 수명, 새로운 기능이 부족한 점 등, 아이폰 16 업그레이드가 필요한지 고민하는 모든 이유를 다루어봅니다.\n\n\n \n 아이폰 16이 출시되었지만, 많은 사용자들은 새로운 모델로의 업그레이드에 대해 회의적인 반응을 보이고 있습니다. 특히, 이미 성능이 뛰어난 아이폰 13 프로 사용자들은 굳이 수백 달러를 더 써가며 새로운 기기로 전환할 필요성을 느끼지 못하고 있습니다. 이 글에서는 아이폰 16 업그레이드가 왜 많은 사람들에게 매력적이지 않은지, 그리고 기존 모델들이 여전히 충분히 강력한 이유를 알아봅니다.\n \n \n1. 아이폰 13 프로의 뛰어난 성능\n아이폰 13 프로는 여전히 최고의 성능을 자랑합니다. 출시된 지 3년이 지났음에도 불구하고, 일상적인 사용에서 성능 저하를 거의 느낄 수 없습니다. 물론 아이폰 16의 새 모델과 비교하면 웹페이지 로딩 속도나 고사양 게임의 처리 성능에서 약간의 차이가 있을 수 있지만, 실제 사용에서는 거의 느끼지 못할 정도입니다. 이는 특히 애플의 강력한 A15 바이오닉 칩과 120Hz 프로모션 디스플레이 덕분입니다. 반면, 아이폰 16의 기본 모델은 여전히 60Hz 주사율을 유지하고 있어 120Hz의 부드러운 화면 전환에 익숙해진 사용자들에게는 큰 매력이 없습니다.\n \n \n2. 배터리 성능과 지속성\n아이폰 13 프로의 배터리 성능도 눈에 띕니다. 3년 간의 헤비한 사용에도 불구하고 배터리 상태는 89%를 유지하고 있습니다. 이는 최적화된 충전 시스템과 최신 배터리 관리 기술 덕분에 가능한 일입니다. 예를 들어, 아이폰 11의 경우 새로운 배터리를 장착한 지 1년 만에 90%로 떨어진 반면, 아이폰 13 프로는 그 이상의 지속성을 보여주고 있습니다. 또한, 기기 외관도 거의 손상이 없으며, 약간의 기스 외에는 큰 문제가 없습니다.\n \n\n\n3. 새로운 기능의 부재\n아이폰 16의 새로운 기능들은 기존 사용자들에게 크게 매력적이지 않을 수 있습니다. 이번 모델은 애플의 대규모 언어 모델과 생성형 AI 기능을 포함하지만, 이는 맥북과 같은 고성능 장치에서 더 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 기능입니다. 예를 들어, 서리(Siri)의 향상된 인공지능 기능이나 애플 인텔리전스(Apple Intelligence)는 주로 데스크탑 작업에서 더 자주 활용될 가능성이 높습니다. 따라서 아이폰에서의 이러한 기능 부족은 사용자에게 큰 문제로 다가오지 않을 것입니다.\n \n \n4. 미래를 위한 업그레이드 대기\n 아이폰 16을 구매하지 않고 기다리는 것이 더 나은 이유도 있습니다. 예를 들어, 2025년에는 아이폰 17 에어와 같은 새로운 모델이 출시될 예정이며, 항상 켜져 있는 120Hz 디스플레이, 화면 아래에 있는 페이스 ID 센서 등 더욱 혁신적인 기능이 탑재될 가능성이 있습니다. 이러한 이유로, 많은 사용자가 현재의 기기를 계속 사용하면서 다음 모델을 기다리는 것이 더 현명한 선택일 수 있습니다.\n \n \n5. iOS 업데이트와 지속적인 지원\n애플은 자사 기기들에 대해 장기간의 소프트웨어 지원을 제공하고 있습니다. 현재 아이폰 XR조차도 iOS 18을 지원하며, 아이폰 13 프로는 2027년까지 소프트웨어 업데이트를 받을 것으로 예상됩니다. 이러한 장기적인 지원 덕분에, 사용자들은 더 오래 기존 기기를 사용할 수 있으며, 소프트웨어 지원이 끝날 때까지 새로운 기능과 보안 패치를 지속적으로 받을 수 있습니다.\n \n \n결론\n\n\n아이폰 16은 분명 매력적인 기능을 갖추고 있지만, 많은 사용자들에게는 충분한 업그레이드 이유가 되지 않습니다. 성능, 배터리 수명, 새로운 기능의 실용성 등을 고려할 때, 기존 아이폰을 사용하는 것이 여전히 충분히 만족스러운 선택이 될 수 있습니다. 다음 모델에 대한 기대감과 현재 기기의 뛰어난 성능은, 지금 당장 아이폰 16으로 업그레이드하지 않는 것이 더 나은 선택임을 보여줍니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Tomasz Tunguz’s recent article on selling AI and software struck a chord with me. As AI adoption grows, both buyers and sellers are facing new challenges—especially around scaling and discovery. Below are my thoughts on his key points, based on my live experiences selling the AI chatbot at Sendbird, and how they relate to what we’re seeing in the market. Check out the full article here: https://tomtunguz.com/software-playbook \nSelling AI is being discovered because the technology is new. Buyers don’t know how to use it or how to buy it.\nI fully agree with this and would emphasize it from two perspectives: selling to both enterprises and SMBs comes with discovery challenges. For enterprises, based on various studies and papers I’ve read, many buyers struggle with scaling their generative AI projects after initial adoption. They face issues expanding AI usage beyond a single application and unlocking its full potential while managing risks. For SMBs, there is still a significant technology and discovery gap. Similar to blockchain, the jargon and user interfaces of most generative AI applications remain too technical, and the product—as well as the introduction of the service—needs to be more user-friendly.\nBecause the sales motions are new, we can’t apply the previous playbook to the new sales process. The CEO/founder should hire a sales leader that they fully trust who focuses on ultimate success. The sales process is a part of the product.\nI strongly agree that the sales process is integral to the product experience. Beyond self-serve onboarding, we must also offer an easy pathway for mid-market and enterprise users to engage with our sales or technical teams when needed. Even during the sales demo, we can start by showcasing a prototype chatbot tailored to the prospect’s website. This not only accelerates technical due diligence but also delivers a faster ‘wow’ moment. The sales and product experience should be tightly integrated.\nBetween PLG vs. sales-led, more companies were sales-led. If starting with PLG, the template sells the product. Fight the empty box problem with great concrete templates that demonstrate how to use AI. If selling top-down, most of the conversations today are at the C-suite rather than the mid-market predominantly because the buying process is new.\nI firmly believe in this. Our platform, paired with strong templates, can effectively sell our AI chatbot product. For example, offering a user-friendly graphical interface for prompt templates instead of relying on text-based ones allows prospects to grasp the product’s potential without much technical effort. However, I remain cautious about top-down selling. If our SaaS product or PMF isn’t fully ready, customization efforts could disrupt our PLG motion. I’m not against taking on SI roles, but we must ensure we want to scale with our platform as a center of our growth\nFiguring out how to consistently produce wow moments with non-deterministic software is essential.\nAbsolutely. This is a key focus for our product and marketing teams, and one of our OKRs this quarter is to improve conversion rates by driving consistent wow moments for our users.\nThe room was split on the pricing model: seats, usage, or some hybrid. Ultimately, pricing captures 15-30% of the value the software/AI creates. Developing a strong case for this with buyers will be key because the ROI question from buyers is real, especially as the broader software market feels pressure.\nValue-based pricing is an excellent approach, but we also face perception challenges. Many customers still view AI products through the lens of past investments, like seat-based pricing models and ROI measured by traditional KPIs, such as cost per inbound/outbound call. We need to pioneer new value-based pricing anchors for AI, and while the challenges are significant, I’m ready to face them head-on.\nOnly VCs care about the word agents/agentic: for most enterprises, agents mean a customer support agent. Many teams don’t care about the underlying technology; they seek a solution to their problem.\nAgreed. We’re still refining our ICP. We’re seeing enterprise leads from Heads of Data Science who have developed their own LLMs but now seek alternatives like Sendbird, where they can achieve faster value. At the same time, Heads of CS/CX are looking to solve business challenges but are frustrated by stalled internal projects.\nThe post Tomasz Tunguz’s AI Sales Playbook: Insights from the Field appeared first on Kimchi hill.",

‘병원에 가야 할 때’의 기준이 있나요?\n오동훈(이하 ‘동훈'): 마음 건강의 이상 징후는 다양하게 나타납니다. 우울증을 예로 들면 기분의 저하를 직접적으로 느끼는 사람도 있지만, 피로감이나 에너지가 달린다는 느낌으로 나타나기도 하죠. 그래서 ‘이 증상이 있을 때'라고 한 가지를 꼽기는 쉽지 않습니다. 다만 정신과 질환을 진단할 때 공통적으로 적용하는 기준은 ‘사회적, 직업적 기능에 이상이 생겼을 때'예요.\n사회적 기능의 이상이란 평소보다 더 사람들을 만나고 싶지 않아서 대인관계를 피한다든지, 신경이 날카로워져서 다른 사람들과 트러블이 늘어난다든지 하는 변화를 말합니다. 직업적 기능의 변화는 업무 효율이 부쩍 떨어지고, 제시간에 출근을 못해서 부정적인 평가를 반복적으로 받는 것이 예시이고요. 이런 문제가 자꾸 생기면 마음에 이상이 생기지 않았나 고민해볼 필요가 있습니다. 가능하다면 믿을 만한 사람에게 직접 털어놓고 의견을 들어보는 것도 방법이에요. 내가 캐치하지 못한 부분을 주변에서는 이미 인지하고 있기도 합니다.\n김지용(이하 ‘지용'): 예전에 이 질문에 대해서 허규형 선생님이 했던 대답이 인상적이어서 저도 자주 쓰는데, ‘가야 되는 건가?’라는 생각이 들 때면 가야 할 때라고 생각합니다. 몸 어딘가가 아프면 스스로 정확한 병명을 몰라도 내과, 이비인후과, 정형외과 등에 자연스럽게 가서 진료를 먼저 받아보게 되죠. 그리고 별 문제 아니란 얘기를 들으면 정말 다행이라고 여기며 홀가분하게 나오고요. 그런데 정신과는 심리적 문턱이 높다 보니까 고민하시다가 초기에 치료할 타이밍을 놓치는 경우가 많습니다.\n허규형(이하 ‘규형'): 세 가지 변화가 있으면 고민이 필요해요..css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;} 수면의 변화, 식욕의 변화, 흥미의 변화입니다. 평소 내 패턴과 비교해서 잠이 너무 안 오거나 너무 많이 잘 때, 입맛이 너무 없거나 너무 많이 먹을 때, 재밌게 하던 것들에서 재미를 느끼지 못할 때는 점검해보시기 바랍니다.\nQ2. 온라인상에 ‘우울증 자가진단 체크리스트' 같은 것이 떠돌아 다니는데, 신뢰할 만한가요?\n규형: 출처가 불분명한 체크리스트만으로 속단하는 것은 조심하셔야 하고요, 검색해서 나오는 것 중 우울증 진단에 사용하는 ‘CES-D, PHQ-9’, ADHD 진단에 쓰는 ‘ASRS’는 저작권 없이 해볼 수 있는 검사 중에 추천할 만한 것들입니다. 보건복지부 국립정신건강센터에서 운영하는 .css-1ly3pih{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}국가정신건강정보포털이라는 웹사이트가 있는데요, 거기서 질환별 자가검진을 해보는 것도 추천드려요.\n지용: 마음이 힘들 때 체크리스트를 이용해 스스로를 돌아보는 것은 나쁘지 않다고 생각합니다. 대부분 DSM이라는, 정신과에서 사용하는 진단 편람상 등재된 기준을 바탕으로 만들어져 있어서 어느 정도 스크리닝하는 데 도움이 될 수 있어요.\n그런데 솔직히 정신과 진단은 간단한 일이 아닙니다. 전문가들도 헷갈릴 때가 많고, 오래 진료를 받아온 환자의 진단이 나중에 바뀌는 경우도 있지요. 같은 증상이라도 다양한 질병에서 비롯됐을 수 있기 때문에 테스트 결과는 ‘내가 의사를 한 번 만나봐야 하는 상태구나'라는 정도로 받아들여주시면 좋겠습니다.\nQ3. 마음건강 관리에 있어 우리나라 사람이 유독 힘들어하는 요인이 있는지요?\n동훈: 예전보다 많이 나아졌지만 여전히 정신과적 문제를 ‘의지의 문제'로 취급하는 경향이 남아 있어요. 그래서 우울증 같은 병이 생겨도 내가 나약해서 생긴 문제라고 생각해 병원 찾는 것을 미루고, 진단을 받아도 치부를 들킨 것처럼 부정하거나 치료를 거부하는 모습을 보입니다.\n그런데 다른 병들처럼 우울증도 증상 발생 후 얼마나 빨리 치료받느냐가 예후에 영향을 많이 미쳐요. 미룰수록 치료가 어렵고 회복에 더 긴 시간이 필요한 것도 똑같고요. 우리가 감기에 걸렸을 때 나약해서 생긴 거라고 생각하지 않듯이, 마음의 문제 또한 치료받아야 하는 질환으로 받아들여야 합니다.\n지용: 대부분 정신과 질환에는 수면 문제가 동반되고, 회복을 위해서는 충분한 수면 시간이 필요해요. 위에서 말씀하셨듯 정신질환은 의지의 문제가 아니라 뇌의 문제이기 때문이죠. 뇌과학 연구에 의하면 사람들의 99%는 7~9시간 사이가 적정 수면시간이라고 해요. 7시간 미만은 안 잔 것과 비슷하다는 연구 결과도 있고요. 그런데 우리나라 평균 수면 시간은 꾸준히 세계 최하위권으로, 7시간 미만으로 보고됩니다. 우리나라는 충분히 자는 것을 게으르다고 보는 시각이 있고, 스스로도 죄책감을 가지는 경우가 많아요. 수면 부족은 우리가 간과해온 정신질환 발병의 큰 원인이 될 수 있습니다.\nQ4. 처음 병원에 가면 어떤 방법으로 진료를 받게 되나요?\n동훈: 첫 진료(초진) 시에는 내원 목적과 심리 상태를 파악하기 위해 일정 분량의 설문지를 작성해요. 그러고 나서 응답 내용을 바탕으로 약 40분 정도 상담을 진행하고요. 지금 가진 가장 큰 불편함은 무엇인지, 언제부터 시작되었는지, 거기에 영향을 준 스트레스나 외부적 요인은 어떤게 있었는지 등을 면담을 통해 파악하고 진단을 내리게 됩니다.\n한 번의 면담으로 충분한 정보를 얻기 어렵다면 추가적인 세션을 갖거나, 심리검사를 진행해서 보다 정확하게 진단을 내리기도 해요. 면담 혹은 검사 결과를 바탕으로 치료 계획을 세우고 그에 맞춰서 실제 치료를 진행하게 되는데, 보통 초진 이후의 진료는 20분 내외로 진행되고 병원에 오시는 주기는 치료 경과에 따라 1~4주 사이에서 정합니다.\n지용: 지금까지 말씀드린 절차는 저희가 근무한 병원을 기준으로 한 것이고, 같은 개인 정신과 의원이라고 할지라도 병원마다 진료 방침과 절차가 다를 수 있어요. 저희 셋도 서로 약간씩 다르거든요. 짧게 증상만 물어보고 약물 처방 위주의 3분 진료를 위주로 진행되는 곳도, 충분한 상담시간을 두는 것을 목표로 하는 곳들도 있죠. 꼭 어디가 좋다 쉽게 정의내릴 수 없는 것이, 환자들도 각자 선호하는 스타일이 달라요. 저는 충분히 얘기 나눠보고 싶은데 그걸 불편해하시고 빠른 처방을 바라시는 분들도 꽤 계시거든요. 그래서 가장 좋은 건 방문하고자 하는 병원에 미리 문의를 하는 거예요. 초진 시간은 보통 얼마나 되는지, 기본적으로 진행되는 검사가 있는지, 대강의 진료비가 어떻게 되는지 등에 대해 알아보시면 좋겠습니다.\nQ5. 정신과 진료비나 치료비는 보통 얼마쯤 예상하면 될까요?\n규형: 치료비도 일괄적으로 말씀드리기는 어려워요. 치료 옵션이 다양하고, 면담 시간이나 기법 등에 따라 비용이 세분화되어 있기 때문이죠. 또 기관의 규모가 의원급인지, 대학병원 같은 상급 종합병원인지에 따라서도 환자가 지급해야 하는 부담률에 차등이 있어요.\n그래도 대략적인 선을 말씀드리자면 상담과 약물 처방을 포함해 초진 시에는 4~5만 원, 재진 시에는 2만 원대 정도를 생각하시면 됩니다. 심리 검사의 경우도 어떤 검사들이 포함되었는지 그 구성에 따라 20만 원대부터 40만 원대까지 다양해요.\nQ6. 정신과 치료는 의료보험과 실비보험 적용이 되나요?\n지용: 정신과 치료도 내과, 소아과 등 다른 의료 영역과 마찬가지로 건강보험 적용을 받아요. 뿐만 아니라 다른 과에 비해 환자가 부담해야 하는 비급여 영역이 굉장히 적은 편입니다.\n실비보험 적용되는지도 진료실에서 종종 질문을 받는데요, 가입한 상품마다 보장 범위가 달라서 바로 대답해드리기는 어려웠어요. 예전에는 정신과 치료가 기간이 오래 걸리고 예후가 좋지 않다는 이유로 대부분의 보험 상품에서 배제되는 경향이 강했지만, 금융감독원에서 실손보험 표준약관을 개선한 뒤로는 보장해주는 상품이 예전보다 늘어났습니다.\nQ7. 정신과 진료 기록이 나에게 불리하게 활용될 일, 정말 없을까요?\n동훈: 정신과 진료 기록은 본인 외에 가족을 포함해서 누구도 임의로 열람할 수 없어요. 면담 시 이야기한 것을 기록하는 진료기록부는 내용 또한 타 병원이나 건강보험공단에도 전송되지 않고요. 특정 질병으로 진료를 받았다는 질병 코드는 건강보험에 이력이 남지만 타인이 조회하는 것은 불가능합니다.\n몇몇 분들이 걱정하는 것처럼 입시나 취업 과정에서 불이익을 받을 가능성도 거의 없어요. ‘거의'라고 표현한 것은 국정원, 항공사 파일럿처럼 일부 특수 직군의 경우 본인의 동의를 얻어 정신과 치료 이력을 조회하기 때문입니다.\nQ8. 정신과 약은 의존성이 높아 평생 먹어야 한다는 걱정에 대해 어떻게 생각하시는지요?\n동훈: 정신과 약이 의존성이 높다는 것은 편견입니다. 물론 신경안정제나 수면제와 같은 몇몇 약을 장기간 복용하면 내성과 금단 증상이 나타나는 것이 사실인데, 일정 기간 동안 적정량을 사용한다는 전제하에서는 어렵지 않게 약을 줄여서 끊을 수 있어요. 그리고 그 외의 항우울제나 기분조절제, 항정신병약물 등 주 치료제로 사용되는 대부분의 약들은 의존성이 없습니다.\n그렇다면 왜 이런 편견이 생겼을까요? 우선 치료 기간이 비교적 길기 때문일 겁니다. 보통 초진으로 우울증 환자분이 오면 저는 9개월에서 1년가량 치료 유지가 필요하다고 말씀드려요. 충분히 좋아졌어도 일정 기간 치료를 해야 재발을 막을 수 있기 때문입니다. 그런데 ‘나는 다 좋아진 거 같은데 굳이 약을 계속 먹어야 할까?’ 하며 이 기간을 견디지 못하시는 경우가 많아요. 임의로 약을 중단하면 증상이 재발해 병원을 찾는 일도 생깁니다. 이러한 과정이 반복되면 “몇년간 약을 먹어도 병이 낫지 않는다\"는 인식이 생기게 돼요.\nQ9. 정신과 병원과 심리상담소는 각각 어떤 때 가야 하고, 받는 치료는 어떻게 다른지요?\n규형: 내가 어떤 문제를 가진 건지, 어떤 치료를 받아야 하는 건지 잘 모르는 상황이라면 우선 병원에 내원하는 것을 권유드려요. 정신과 의사들은 정해진 기준에 맞춰 어떤 정신질환인지 진단하도록 훈련받은 사람들이므로 문제를 정확히 파악해내는 데 좀 더 강점이 있다고 생각합니다.\n병원에서는 상담치료 외에 약물치료, 자기장이나 전류를 이용해 뇌를 직접 자극하는 TDCS나 TMS 같은 치료들도 이뤄져요. 이렇게 다양한 치료적 옵션이 존재하기 때문에, 적합한 선택지를 고를 수 있는 여지도 크다는 것을 참고하시면 좋을 것 같습니다.\n동훈: 심리상담소에서는 병원에 비해 더 긴 시간 동안 상담 전문가에게 내 이야기를 할 수 있다는 장점이 있어요. 병원마다 차이가 있겠지만 보통 재진 진료는 20분 내외로 이뤄집니다. 하지만 상담소에서는 한 세션당 40분에서 1시간가량을 할애하기 때문에 여유 있게 풀어놓고 싶었던 이야기를 할 수 있고, 결과적으로 좀 더 깊이 있는 상담이 이루어질 여지가 있다는 것이 이점이라고 생각합니다.\nQ10. 정신과와 심리상담소는 환자의 증상에 따라 서로 추천하기도 한다고 들었습니다. 자주 있는 일인가요?\n동훈: 심리상담소에서도 충분히 좋은 도움을 받을 수 있어요. 특히, 상대적으로 긴 면담을 정기적으로 원하시는 경우에 좋은 선택이 될 수 있습니다. 다만 특정 심리상담소 방문을 추천할 때는 저와 같이 근무했거나 직접 만나뵌 경험이 있어서 인품과 치료 방식을 알고 있을 때만 드려요. 환자분이 가셔서 잘 맞지 않거나 불편한 상황이 생길 수 있기 때문에 신중해질 수밖에 없습니다.\n규형: 저도 상담을 추천드리는 경우가 꽤 자주 있습니다. 기본적으로 긴 상담을 원하시는 분이나 부부 상담, 커플 상담, 가족 상담처럼 여러 사람이 함께 상담해야 하는 경우에 심리상담소를 권유해요. 저 역시 연계된 심리상담소가 따로 있는 것은 아니라서, 근처에 공인된 자격증을 가진 분을 찾아가도록 안내해 드립니다. 예를 들어 한국상담심리학회 공인 상담심리사나 보건복지부 공인 정신건강임상심리사 같은 자격증을 확인하시면 됩니다.\nQ11. 어떤 기준으로 좋은(혹은 나쁜) 정신과 의사나 심리상담사라는 판단을 할 수 있을까요? 치료 잘 받는 방법이 있나요?\n동훈: 심리 치료와 정신과 치료 모두 가능한 한 가까운 곳에서 받는 것이 좋다고 생각합니다. 짧지 않은 기간 동안 치료를 잘 받기 위해서는 회사나 집에서 가까워서 가기 편한 곳을 선택하는 게 중요해요. 근처 병원이나 상담소 중에서 치료자의 이력이나 첫인상을 보고 마음에 드는 곳을 찾았다면, 전화를 걸어 치료 절차에 대해 문의해보세요. 예를 들어, 일반적인 치료 시간, 대략적인 비용, 예약제로 운영되는지 여부 등을 물어볼 수 있습니다. 특히 정신과 병원의 경우, 약 처방 위주로 짧게 진료하는 곳도 있고, 상담을 충분히 하는 곳도 있어요. 그렇다고 해서 짧게 진료한다고 무조건 나쁜 것은 아니고, 상담을 길게 한다고 해서 항상 좋은 것도 아니에요. 각자의 필요와 상황에 맞게 결정하면 됩니다. 치료자가 자신과 잘 맞을지는 직접 경험해 보기 전에는 알 수 없지만, 이러한 과정을 거치면 시행착오를 줄이는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다.\n규형: 정신과 의사나 상담사와 환자(내담자) 간에도 '케미'가 분명히 존재합니다. 어떤 치료자가 누군가에게는 별로일 수 있지만, 다른 사람에게는 매우 좋은 치료자가 될 수 있고, 그 반대의 경우도 있죠. 만약 치료자가 자신과 맞지 않는 것 같다면 그 부분에 대해 솔직히 이야기하고 서로 맞춰 가는 것을 추천드립니다. 그래도 안 맞으면 치료자를 바꾸는 것도 얼마든지 가능하고요. 처음부터 딱 맞는 사람을 기대하지 않는 것도 좋은 방법입니다.\nQ12. 정신과 병원을 찾아가는 것도, 회당 10만 원 내외인 상담료를 부담하며 심리상담소를 찾아가는 것도 결심이 잘 서지 않는다면 시도해볼 방법이 있을까요?\n동훈: 각 지자체가 운영하는 정신건강복지센터에 일정 회기 동안 무료로 상담을 제공하는 프로그램이 있어요. 병원이나 상담소에 바로 가는 것이 부담스럽다면, 이러한 프로그램을 먼저 이용해보는 것도 좋은 방법입니다. 그 과정에서 만약 보다 전문적인 치료가 필요하다고 판단되면, 병원으로 연계해 줄 수도 있습니다.\n지용: 정신질환이 만성화되면 사회적 혹은 경제적으로 어려운 상황에 처하게 돼서 치료 자체가 힘들어지는 경우가 많습니다. 그래서 무료로 제공되는 치료 프로그램들이 매우 소중하죠. 하지만 무료 프로그램들은 제한된 자원으로 여러 사람에게 도움을 주려다 보니 아직 아쉬운 점들이 있고, 특히 장기간 지속되기가 어려워요. 이러한 한계를 인식하고 무료 프로그램을 본격적인 치료로 이어지는 첫 단계 정도로 생각해주시면 좋겠습니다.\n우리 사회에서는 아직도 정신 치료와 상담의 가치를 낮게 보는 경향이 있는 것 같아요. 예를 들어, \"말 좀 들어주고 누구나 할 수 있는 이야기해주면서 돈을 받느냐\"는 식의 시각이 있죠. 하지만 우리의 정신을 담는 그릇인 뇌는 우리 몸에서 가장 중요한 장기이며, 그 정신을 다루는 상담 치료는 우리의 인생에 매우 중요한 영향을 미칩니다. 자신의 삶을 변화시키기 위해 적절한 투자를 한다는 마인드를 지니면 더 큰 변화를 경험하실 수 있을 거라고 생각합니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은, 이지영 Graphic 조수희",

(중략)\n\n\n미국 연방준비제도(연준, Fed)가 마침내 금리 인하를 준비하고 있다는 신호를 보냈습니다. 물가상승률이 목표치인 2%에 점점 가까워지고 고용률 둔화가 가시화되면서, 이제 금리를 내릴 시기가 다가온 것이죠.\n기준 금리 인하가 확실시되는 상황에서 핵심은 얼마나 ‘강하게’ 금리를 내릴 것인가입니다. 현재 두 가지 시나리오가 제시되고 있습니다.\n첫 번째는 '빅 컷(Big Cut)'으로, 한 번에 0.5%p를 크게 인하하는 방식입니다. 지난 6일 발표된 8월 미국 비농업 부문의 신규 고용이 전월 대비 14만 2,000명 늘며, 월가 예상치(16만 4,000명)를 밑돌자, 빅 컷이 힘을 받기도 했어요.\n이렇게 되면 경기 부양 효과가 상당히 크겠지만, 그만큼 달러 가치가 크게 하락할 가능성도 있습니다. 달러가 약세를 보이면 미국 수출 기업들에게는 유리하지만, 수입품 가격이 오르면서 물가에 다시 압력이 가해질 수 있겠죠.\n두 번째 시나리오는 '베이비 컷(Baby Cut)'입니다. 0.25%p만 살짝 내리는 방법인데요. 주요국 중앙은행이 금리를 인하할 때 통상 0.25%p씩 수정하는 경우가 많기 때문에, 시장에서는 베이비 컷이 더 높은 확률로 점쳐지고 있는 상황입니다.\n이 경우 경기 부양 효과는 조금 덜하겠지만, 달러가 급격하게 약세로 돌아서지는 않을 가능성이 큽니다. 만약 연준이 이 방식을 선택한다면, 시장 변동성은 최소화하면서 신중하게 금리 조정을 이어가려는 선택이 되겠지요.\n결론적으로 미국 경제의 물가와 고용 상황은 금리 인하를 예고하고 있고, 얼마나 강하게 금리가 내릴지 모두가 주목하고 있는 상황입니다. 오는 9월 17~18일에 열리는 연방공개시장위원회(FOMC) 회의에서 최종 결정이 나올 것으로 예상되는데요. 이때 발표되는 결과에 따라 달러 가치와 원·달러 환율에 큰 영향이 미칠 것으로 예상돼요. 앞으로의 시장 반응과 경제 지표에 더욱더 주목해야 할 시점이라 볼 수 있겠습니다.\n기준금리 발표는 18일 오후 2시, 제롬 파월 연준 의장의 발언은 오후 2시 30분에 진행될 예정인데요. (한국 시간 기준으로는 연휴 다음날인 19일 새벽 3시, 3시 30분) 국내 투자자들 입장에서는 FOMC 직전 3일간 추석 연휴로 인해 포지션을 조정할 기회 없이 미국의 통화정책 결과를 받아들이게 되는 셈입니다.\n이에 전문가들은 현금 비중을 높이고 주식 비중을 축소하는 등 상대적으로 변동성이 작은 종목에 투자할 것을 권유하고 있어요. 특히 원/달러 환율이 하락하면서 단기간 내 환차익을 실현하고자 하는 욕구가 높아진 외국인이 국내 주식시장에 유입되며 지수를 끌어내릴 수 있기 때문에, 외국인 보유 비중이 적은 종목 중심으로 대응하는 것이 필요하다는 의견도 있습니다.\n앞으로의 시장은 경기 향방과 9월에 결정될 금리 인하 폭에 대한 설전이 오고가며 한두 차례 큰 변동성이 나타날 가능성이 있어 보입니다. 기술적 반등이 나올 수도 있으며, 반도체·IT·자동차·기계 등의 업종에서 단기 트레이딩의 움직임이 보일 수 있다는 것도 참고할 수 있겠습니다.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n기준 금리: 다른 금리들에 영향을 주는 기준점이 되는 금리. 중앙은행의 정책금리로, 경제 전반에 걸쳐 금리 수준을 결정하는 중요한 지표로 활용돼요. 경기 과열로 물가가 너무 오르면 기준금리를 올려 시중의 돈을 거둬들이고, 경기 침체로 시중에 돈이 돌지 못하면 기준금리를 낮춰 시중에 유동성을 공급함으로써 경제를 안정적으로 유지하려 합니다.\n양적 완화: 금리 인하를 통한 경기 부양 효과가 한계가 있을 때, 중앙은행이 국채나 금융자산을 대규모로 매입하여 시중에 유동성을 직접 공급하는 것. 중앙은행은 양적 완화를 통해 신용경색을 해소하고, 경제 성장을 촉진하기를 기대해요.\n물가안정 목표제: 중앙은행이 중기적으로 달성해야 할 물가상승률 목표치를 미리 제시하고 이를 유지하려는 제도. 현재 미국 연방준비제도(Fed)와 한국은행의 인플레이션 목표는 통상 2%인데요. 이 목표치에 근접하면 금리 인하나 인상이 고려됩니다.\n\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0 8px;cursor:pointer;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--adaptiveGrey700);}\n.css-1dzrkjz{width:16px;margin-right:8px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;}\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper >.svg-icon:empty+.svg-icon-fallback{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}.svg-icon{color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon svg,.svg-icon img{display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon--hide{display:none;}.svg-icon-fallback{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:0;z-index:z-index(hidden);visibility:hidden;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon-fallback--show{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}\n참고자료\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
