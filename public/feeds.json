        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting with Visual Studio 2026, we are introducing a new support lifecycle for the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools. We are also updating the MSVC release cadence.\nAs Visual Studio moves to a Modern Lifecycle with monthly feature updates and an annual new version, decoupling the compiler from the IDE offers you the best of both worlds – rapid iteration in the IDE and predictable, long-term stability for the build tools. This approach brings you the latest C++ advancements across both IDE and build tools while helping you maintain secure and compliant build environments, with enterprise-grade support, and flexible upgrades at your own pace.\nIn this post, we outline the key changes, what stays the same, and how we will help your organization with this transition.\nSummary of the MSVC release and support lifecycle changes\nVisual Studio 2026 version 18.0 released November 11 with MSVC version 14.50. This version of MSVC will be a long-term support release (LTS).\nWhat’s changing?\nStarting with this release, we are separating the lifecycle of MSVC from Visual Studio and adopting the Modern Lifecycle Policy.\n\nThese changes are specific to the Microsoft C++ Build Tools, which is the collection of Windows C++ compiler tools (e.g., cl.exe, link.exe), C and C++ libraries (STL, ATL/MFC, OpenMP, etc.), and VC Runtime redistributable files. These components are usually installed under [VS Folder]\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.NN.NNNNN\\.\nCadence: MSVC will ship a new release every six months (in May and November), as part of the Visual Studio monthly feature update released on the Stable channel, with 9 months of support.\nLong-Term Support (LTS): Every two years, we will designate the November release as an MSVC LTS release, receiving 3 years of support with bug fixes, security updates, and compatibility improvements.\nAvailability: All releases, including MSVC previews, will be available on the Stable Channel and the Insiders Channel for users to opt-in.\nThe following diagram depicts what our MSVC release schedule may look like for the upcoming years.\nImage: MSVC release cadence and support lifecycle (Illustrative timeline only: actual release dates are subject to change and will be officially announced through our regular channels)\nWhat stays the same?\nMSVC acquisition in Visual Studio: Visual Studio will continue to be the primary way to install MSVC using both the full Visual Studio IDE install or the Visual Studio Build Tools install.\nAccess to multiple versions of MSVC: Visual Studio continues to offer multiple MSVC versions, including unsupported ones for a limited time, allowing you to update your IDE while independently installing the build tools versions your project require.\nC++ binary compatibility: MSVC 14.50 will continue to be ABI compatible with MSVC versions dating back to Visual Studio 2015, allowing your team to more easily migrate between MSVC versions, independently of your other C++ dependencies.\nC++ Redistributable (VCRedist) follows the lifecycle of the MSVC Build Tools they ship with and continues to be a binary-compatible in-place upgrade (meaning that newer versions of VCRedist will replace older ones without breaking existing applications that were originally built with older versions).\nSupport for earlier MSVC releases: The MSVC versions that shipped with Visual Studio 2022 and earlier will continue to be supported according to the lifecycle of Visual Studio in which they first shipped. The new modern support lifecycle applies only to MSVC version 14.50 and up.\nSupport for other VS components: No other components installed by Visual Studio e.g., other toolsets, libraries, SDKs, or frameworks are impacted by this change.\nDrivers for change\nPreviously, MSVC followed Visual Studio’s support policy and release schedule. With Visual Studio 2026, MSVC’s lifecycle will prioritize stability, compliance, and modernization to better serve your needs. This shift allows us to deliver more predictable long-term support, help teams stay compliant with evolving regulations, and simplify upgrades with new tooling, all while reducing fragmentation and investing in secure, modern C++ practices:\nNew Visual Studio 2026 release cadence: Visual Studio will now be released monthly rather than quarterly, introducing new productivity features and AI workflows more frequently. As the IDE moves faster, we recognize that most customers won’t benefit from MSVC releases on the same new cadence as the IDE. To reflect this preference for stability, MSVC build tools will have a decoupled, less frequent release schedule. And for anyone that wants to move faster between MSVC versions, you can take advantage of our MSVC Preview releases that will be available in Visual Studio on both Insiders and Stable channels.\nAlign with .NET long-term support: .NET is already following a modern lifecycle policy. .NET 10 shipped this November, and it is an LTS release for .NET customers. For simplicity and convenience, we are aligning the MSVC build tools LTS schedule to the .NET LTS schedule by designating our November release (MSVC 14.50) as an LTS release.\nGetting current and compliant: Regulations like CyberEO (US) and CRA (EU) require up-to-date tools to secure the software supply chains. Meeting standards, such as NIST and CISA, means depending on outdated compilers is no longer acceptable. These standards are continually evolving to address new security challenges, making regular tool updates essential to maintain compliance. Updating to the latest tools also enables access to more secure and modern coding practices to tackle current threats.\nMore value with less fragmentation: Supporting 10-year-old compilers has become increasingly complex. Focusing on fewer MSVC versions lets us maintain the service and security updates you’ve come to expect while investing more towards improving C++ standards conformance, code safety, and performance.\nWith these reasons in mind, our goal is to modernize the MSVC lifecycle in a way that encourages agility and innovation while providing the best possible support for your enterprise needs.\nHelping your team upgrade\nTo keep your development environment up-to-date and secure, we recommend adopting a regular toolset upgrade rhythm aligned with our MSVC release cadence. We understand that upgrading can present challenges and comes with costs, especially for teams that haven’t prioritized frequent updates before. Based on your feedback, we’re investing in tools and workflows to make moving to the latest version easier, faster, and more predictable:\nImproved Upgrade Workflow in Visual Studio: Visual Studio 2026 introduces a more flexible upgrade experience called Setup Assistant that decouples toolset upgrades from the initial toolset acquisition experience, streamlining side-by-side installations of missing toolsets.\nThe overlap of support windows makes migrations easier, whether you upgrade with every release or stick with LTS. You get a one-year overlap for LTS versions and a three-month overlap for regular releases, giving you time to upgrade while staying supported.\nC++ Binary Compatibility for MSVC 14.50: It’s also easy to incrementally upgrade your solutions, taking full advantage of our ABI compatibility guarantee for MSVC 14.50. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and all your external dependencies at once. And for your third party open-source dependencies, you can count on the vcpkg package manager to rebuild them using the latest toolset.\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++: We’re also introducing a new AI-assisted toolset upgrade experience in Visual Studio as a Private Preview. This new functionality can, for example, adjust project settings, enable new recommended warnings or security flags, and even modify source code to eliminate classes of errors introduced by stricter compliance in our compiler. If you are interested, you can sign up for the Private Preview of our GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ today.\nSign up for the GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ Private Preview waitlist\n\nLooking ahead\nThank you for being a valued C++ customer. If you have any questions about how the new MSVC support lifecycle and release cadence may impact your team, you can reach out to us at vcupgrade@microsoft.com.\nWith the latest MSVC release alongside Visual Studio 2026, we’re excited to bring you significant performance enhancements, improved standards conformance and enhanced security features.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re introducing Zoomer, Meta’s comprehensive, automated debugging and optimization platform for AI. \nZoomer works across all of our training and inference workloads at Meta and provides deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains in our AI infrastructure. \nZoomer has delivered training time reductions, and significant QPS improvements, making it the de-facto tool for AI performance optimization across Meta’s entire AI infrastructure.\nAt the scale that Meta’s AI infrastructure operates, poor performance debugging can lead to massive energy inefficiency, increased operational costs, and suboptimal hardware utilization across hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The fundamental challenge is achieving maximum computational efficiency while minimizing waste. Every percentage point of utilization improvement translates to significant capacity gains that can be redirected to innovation and growth.\nZoomer is Meta’s automated, one-stop-shop platform for performance profiling, debugging, analysis, and optimization of AI training and inference workloads. Since its inception, Zoomer has become the de-facto tool across Meta for GPU workload optimization, generating tens of thousands of profiling reports daily for teams across all of our apps. \nWhy Debugging Performance Matters\nOur AI infrastructure supports large-scale and advanced workloads across a global fleet of GPU clusters, continually evolving to meet the growing scale and complexity of generative AI.\nAt the training level it supports a diverse range of workloads, including powering models for ads ranking, content recommendations, and GenAI features.  \nAt the inference level, we serve hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day.\nOperating at this scale means putting a high priority on eliminating GPU underutilization. Training inefficiencies delay model iterations and product launches, while inference bottlenecks limit our ability to serve user requests at scale. Removing resource waste and accelerating workflows helps us train larger models more efficiently, serve more users, and reduce our environmental footprint.\nAI Performance Optimization Using Zoomer\nZoomer is an automated debugging and optimization platform that works across all of our AI model types (ads recommendations, GenAI, computer vision, etc.) and both training and inference paradigms, providing deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains.  \nZoomer’s architecture consists of three essential layers that work together to deliver comprehensive AI performance insights: \nInfrastructure and Platform Layer\nThe foundation provides the enterprise-grade scalability and reliability needed to profile workloads across Meta’s massive infrastructure. This includes distributed storage systems using Manifold (Meta’s blob storage platform) for trace data, fault-tolerant processing pipelines that handle huge trace files, and low-latency data collection with automatic profiling triggers across thousands of hosts simultaneously. The platform maintains high availability and scale through redundant processing workers and can handle huge numbers of profiling requests during peak usage periods.\nAnalytics and Insights Engine\nThe core intelligence layer delivers deep analytical capabilities through multiple specialized analyzers. This includes: GPU trace analysis via Kineto integration and NVIDIA DCGM, CPU profiling through StrobeLight integration, host-level metrics analysis via dyno telemetry, communication pattern analysis for distributed training, straggler detection across distributed ranks, memory allocation profiling (including GPU memory snooping), request/response profiling for inference workloads, and much more. The engine automatically detects performance anti-patterns and also provides actionable recommendations.\nVisualization and User Interface Layer\nThe presentation layer transforms complex performance data into intuitive, actionable insights. This includes interactive timeline visualizations showing GPU activity across thousands of ranks, multi-iteration analysis for long-running training workloads, drill-down dashboards with percentile analysis across devices, trace data visualization integrated with Perfetto for kernel-level inspection, heat map visualizations for identifying outliers across GPU deployments, and automated insight summaries that highlight critical bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.\nThe three essential layers of Zoomer’s architecture.\nHow Zoomer Profiling Works: From Trigger to Insights\nUnderstanding how Zoomer conducts a complete performance analysis provides insight into its sophisticated approach to AI workload optimization.\nProfiling Trigger Mechanisms\nZoomer operates through both automatic and on-demand profiling strategies tailored to different workload types. For training workloads, which involve multiple iterations and can run for days or weeks, Zoomer automatically triggers profiling around iteration 550-555 to capture stable-state performance while avoiding startup noise. For inference workloads, profiling can be triggered on-demand for immediate debugging or through integration with automated load testing and benchmarking systems for continuous monitoring.\nComprehensive Data Capture\nDuring each profiling session, Zoomer simultaneously collects multiple data streams to build a holistic performance picture: \nGPU Performance Metrics: SM utilization, GPU memory utilization, GPU busy time, memory bandwidth, Tensor Core utilization, power consumption, clock frequencies, and power consumption data via DCGM integration.\nDetailed Execution Traces: Kernel-level GPU operations, memory transfers, CUDA API calls, and communication collectives via PyTorch Profiler and Kineto.\nHost-Level Performance Data: CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, storage access patterns, and system-level bottlenecks via dyno telemetry.\nApplication-Level Annotations: Training iterations, forward/backward passes, optimizer steps, data loading phases, and custom user annotations.\nInference-Specific Data: Rate of inference requests, server latency, active requests, GPU memory allocation patterns, request latency breakdowns via Strobelight’s Crochet profiler, serving parameter analysis, and thrift request-level profiling.\nCommunication Analysis: NCCL collective operations, inter-node communication patterns, and network utilization for distributed workloads\nDistributed Analysis Pipeline\nRaw profiling data flows through sophisticated processing systems that deliver multiple types of automated analysis including:\nStraggler Detection: Identifies slow ranks in distributed training through comparative analysis of execution timelines and communication patterns.\nBottleneck Analysis: Automatically detects CPU-bound, GPU-bound, memory-bound, or communication-bound performance issues.\nCritical Path Analysis: Systematically identifies the longest execution paths to focus optimization efforts on highest-impact opportunities.\nAnti-Pattern Detection: Rule-based systems that identify common efficiency issues and generate specific recommendations.\nParallelism Analysis: Deep understanding of tensor, pipeline, data, and expert parallelism interactions for large-scale distributed training.\nMemory Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of GPU memory usage patterns, allocation tracking, and leak detection.\nLoad Imbalance Analysis: Detects workload distribution issues across distributed ranks and recommendations for optimization.\nMulti-Format Output Generation\nResults are presented through multiple interfaces tailored to different user needs: interactive timeline visualizations showing activity across all ranks and hosts, comprehensive metrics dashboards with drill-down capabilities and percentile analysis, trace viewers integrated with Perfetto for detailed kernel inspection, automated insights summaries highlighting key bottlenecks and recommendations, and actionable notebooks that users can clone to rerun jobs with suggested optimizations.\nSpecialized Workload Support\nFor massive distributed training for specialized workloads, like GenAI, Zoomer contains a purpose-built platform supporting LLM workloads that offers specialized capabilities including GPU efficiency heat maps and N-dimensional parallelism visualization. For inference, specialized analysis covers everything from single GPU models, soon expanding to massive distributed inference across thousands of servers.\nA Glimpse Into Advanced Zoomer Capabilities\nZoomer offers an extensive suite of advanced capabilities designed for different AI workload types and scales. While a comprehensive overview of all features would require multiple blog posts, here’s a glimpse at some of the most compelling capabilities that demonstrate Zoomer’s depth:\nTraining Powerhouse Features:\nStraggler Analysis: Helps identify ranks in distributed training jobs that are significantly slower than others, causing overall job delays due to synchronization bottlenecks. Zoomer provides information that helps diagnose root causes like sharding imbalance or hardware issues.\nCritical Path Analysis: Identification of the longest execution paths in PyTorch applications, enabling accurate performance improvement projections. \nAdvanced Trace Manipulation: Sophisticated tools for compression, filtering, combination, and segmentation of massive trace files (2GB+ per rank), enabling analysis of previously impossible-to-process large-scale training jobs\nInference Excellence Features:\nSingle-Click QPS Optimization: A workflow that identifies bottlenecks and triggers automated load tests with one click, reducing optimization time while delivering QPS improvements of +2% to +50% across different models, depending on model characteristics. \nRequest-Level Deep Dive: Integration with Crochet profiler provides Thrift request-level analysis, enabling identification of queue time bottlenecks and serving inefficiencies that traditional metrics miss.\nRealtime Memory Profiling: GPU memory allocation tracking, providing live insights into memory leaks, allocation patterns, and optimization opportunities.\nGenAI Specialized Features:\nLLM Zoomer for Scale: A purpose-built platform supporting 100k+ GPU workloads with N-dimensional parallelism visualization, GPU efficiency heat maps across thousands of devices, and specialized analysis for tensor, pipeline, data, and expert parallelism interactions.\nPost-Training Workflow Support: Enhanced capabilities for GenAI post-training tasks including SFT, DPO, and ARPG workflows with generator and trainer profiling separation.\nUniversal Intelligence Features:\nHolistic Trace Analysis (HTA): Advanced framework for diagnosing distributed training bottlenecks across communication overhead, workload imbalance, and kernel inefficiencies, with automatic load balancing recommendations.\nZoomer Actionable Recommendations Engine (Zoomer AR): Automated detection of efficiency anti-patterns with machine learning-driven recommendation systems that generate auto-fix diffs, optimization notebooks, and one-click job re-launches with suggested improvements.\nMulti-Hardware Profiling: Native support across NVIDIA GPUs, AMD MI300X, MTIA, and CPU-only workloads with consistent analysis and optimization recommendations regardless of hardware platform.\nZoomer’s Optimization Impact: From Debugging to Energy Efficiency\nPerformance debugging with Zoomer creates a cascading effect that transforms low-level optimizations into massive efficiency gains. \nThe optimization pathway flows from: identifying bottlenecks → improving key metrics → accelerating workflows → reducing resource consumption → saving energy and costs.\nZoomer’s Training Optimization Pipeline\nZoomer’s training analysis identifies bottlenecks in GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and communication patterns. \nExample of Training Efficiency Wins: \nAlgorithmic Optimizations: We delivered power savings through systematic efficiency improvements across the training fleet, by fixing reliability issues for low efficiency jobs.\nTraining Time Reduction Success: In 2024, we observed a 75% training time reduction for Ads relevance models, leading to 78% reduction in power consumption.\nMemory Optimizations: One-line code changes for performance issues due to inefficient memory copy identified by Zoomer, delivered 20% QPS improvements with minimal engineering effort. \nInference Optimization Pipeline:\nInference debugging focuses on latency reduction, throughput optimization, and serving efficiency. Zoomer identifies opportunities in kernel execution, memory access patterns, and serving parameter tuning to maximize requests per GPU.\nInference Efficiency Wins:\nGPU and CPU Serving parameters Improvements: Automated GPU and CPU bottleneck identification and parameter tuning, leading to 10% to 45% reduction in power consumption.\nQPS Optimization: GPU trace analysis used to boost serving QPS and optimize serving capacity.\nZoomer’s GenAI and Large-Scale Impact\nFor massive distributed workloads, even small optimizations compound dramatically. 32k GPU benchmark optimizations achieved 30% speedups through broadcast issue resolution, while 64k GPU configurations delivered 25% speedups in just one day of optimization.\nThe Future of AI Performance Debugging\nAs AI workloads expand in size and complexity, Zoomer is advancing to meet new challenges focused on several innovation fronts: broadening unified performance insights across heterogeneous hardware (including MTIA and next-gen accelerators), building advanced analyzers for proactive optimization, enabling inference performance tuning through serving param optimization, and democratizing optimization with automated, intuitive tools for all engineers. As Meta’s AI infrastructure continues its rapid growth, Zoomer plays an important role in helping us innovate efficiently and sustainably. \nThe post Zoomer: Powering AI Performance at Meta’s Scale Through Intelligent Debugging and Optimization appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "pubDate": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 17:00:21 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to share another advancement in the security of your conversations on Messenger: the launch of key transparency verification for end-to-end encrypted chats. \nThis new feature enables an additional level of assurance that only you — and the people you’re communicating with — can see or listen to what is sent, and that no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\nEnd-to-end encryption on Messenger already ensures that the content of your direct messages and calls are protected from the moment they leave your device to the moment they reach the receiver’s device. As part of our end-to-end encrypted chat platform, we believe it’s also important that anyone can verify that the public keys (used by the sender’s device for encrypting each message) belong to the intended recipients and haven’t been tampered with.\nThis launch builds upon the valuable work and experiences shared by others in the industry. WhatsApp’s implementation of key transparency in 2023 demonstrated the feasibility of this technology for large-scale encrypted messaging. We’ve extended these pioneering efforts in our Messenger implementation to deliver a robust and reliable solution with similar security properties.\nWhat Is Key Transparency?\nKey transparency provides messaging users with a verifiable and auditable record of public keys. It allows them to confirm that their conversations are indeed encrypted with the correct keys for their contacts, and that these keys haven’t been maliciously swapped by a compromised server. This means you can be more confident that your messages are only accessible to the people you intend to communicate with.\n\nYou can already check your keys for end-to-end encrypted chats on Messenger, but this can be cumbersome for people who have logged in to Messenger on multiple devices, each of which has its own key. Moreover, these keys change when new devices are added or are re-registered, which necessitates another check of the key every time this happens. \nTo address this, we’ve added a new security feature, based on key transparency, that allows users to verify these keys without having to compare them manually with their contacts. Of course, anyone who wishes to continue manually verifying their keys is free to do so.\nHow We’re Handling Messenger Keys at Scale\nOur key transparency implementation leverages the Auditable Key Directory (AKD) library, mirroring the system already in place for WhatsApp. This system allows Meta to securely distribute and verify users’ public keys. To further enhance the security of this process, we use Cloudflare’s key transparency auditor to provide an additional layer of verification, ensuring that the distribution of keys is transparent and verifiable by anyone. Cloudflare’s auditor maintains a live log of the latest entries on the Key Transparency Dashboard, for both the WhatsApp and Messenger directories.\nImplementing key transparency on the scale of Messenger presented unique engineering challenges. One significant factor was the sheer volume and frequency of key updates. Messenger indexes keys for each and every device someone has logged in on, which means that a single user often has multiple, frequently-changing keys associated with their account.\nThis increased complexity leads to a much higher frequency of key updates being sequenced into our key transparency directory. Currently, we’re observing an epoch frequency of approximately 2 minutes per publish, with hundreds of thousands of new keys added in each epoch. Since we began indexing, our database has already grown to billions of key entries. We’ve implemented a number of advancements in our infrastructure and libraries to help manage this massive and constantly growing dataset, while ensuring high availability and real-time verification:\nWe improved the algorithmic efficiency of the existing key lookup and verification operations in the AKD library by optimizing for smaller proof sizes, even as the number of updates (versions) for a single key grows. Previously, these proofs grew linearly with the height of the transparency tree, which was still difficult to manage given the number of nodes in the tree.\nWe also updated our existing infrastructure to be more resilient to temporary outages and improved the process for recovering from long delays in key sequencing. These improvements were adapted from lessons learned from running WhatsApp’s key transparency log for the past two years.\nWith key transparency now live on Messenger, users will have the ability to automatically verify the authenticity of their contacts’ encryption keys for one-on-one chats. This represents another step forward in our ongoing investment in providing a secure and private service. \nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the security and privacy of end-to-end encryption in Messenger.\nThe post Key Transparency Comes to Messenger appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring’s AOT engine has been around since the Spring Native days, but Spring Data never really benefited from it – until now. Repository infrastructure is one of the most dynamic parts of the framework, and for years it relied heavily on proxies, reflection, and queries generated at runtime.\nThat flexibility has a price: it slows startup and forces the system to do considerable runtime processing just to interpret something as simple as findPersonByNameLike.\nWith the latest Spring Data release, repositories finally get proper AOT support. Method queries can now be pre-generated during the build process, so you don’t have to wait until runtime.\nAnd here’s where IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 comes in: you can now inspect, navigate, and debug these AOT-generated repository classes in the IDE. This article focuses on the developer experience, exploring how to configure build tools and how IntelliJ IDEA makes the development process faster, easier, and less error-prone.\nAOT repository internals overview\nEnabling AOT is an easy task. You can find a good manual in the official documentation for both:\nGradle \nMaven \n\n\n\n\nAfter running the build, by default, AOT-generated sources appear in:\nbuild/generated/aotSources for Gradle\ntarget/spring-aot/main/classes/ if you use Maven\n\n\n\n\nFor IntelliJ IDEA, two artifacts matter most:\nThe generated source code\nThe JSON metadata describing repository methods and their queries\n\n\n\n\nTo illustrate, let’s assume our application exposes quotes, and we need a method to fetch quotes by author:\nList<Quote> findAllByAuthor(String author);\nDepending on whether you use Spring Data JPA or JDBC, the generated implementation varies.\nExample: Spring Data JPA\nFor JPA repositories, IntelliJ IDEA shows the generated JPQL query above the method signature.\n\n\n\n\nClicking the   icon takes you straight to the AOT-generated implementation:\npublic List<Quote> findAllByAuthor(String author) {\n  String queryString = \"SELECT q FROM Quote q WHERE q.author = :author\";\n  Query query = this.entityManager.createQuery(queryString);\n  query.setParameter(\"author\", author);\n  \n  return (List<Quote>) query.getResultList();\n}\nThis is the actual code that will be executed at runtime when AOT mode is enabled.\nExample: Spring Data JDBC\nFor Spring Data JDBC, the picture is a bit different. We can see pure SQL and a list of fields selected for mapping to the Java object. This is the repository code with the query above the method: \n\n\n\n\nAnd this is the generated code:\npublic List<Quote> findAllByAuthor(String author) {\n  Criteria criteria = Criteria.where(\"author\").is(author);\n  StatementFactory.SelectionBuilder builder = getStatementFactory().select(Quote.class).filter(criteria);\n\n  RowMapper rowMapper = getRowMapperFactory().create(Quote.class);\n  List result = (List) builder.executeWith((sql, paramSource) -> getJdbcOperations().query(sql, paramSource, new RowMapperResultSetExtractor<>(rowMapper)));\n  return (List<Quote>) convertMany(result, Quote.class);\n}\nHow IntelliJ IDEA displays queries\nIntelliJ IDEA treats the AOT output as part of the project’s source set. This provides the following:\nDirect navigation into generated methods\nCode highlighting and analysis\nLinking compiled classes to their generated sources\n\n\n\n\nSpring Data’s AOT process also creates JSON metadata for every repository method. These files are a part of the project’s resources, and they provide the information about the actual JPQL/SQL query: \nFor JPA:\nAnd for JDBC:\n{\n  \"name\": \"findAllByAuthor\",\n  \"signature\": \"public abstract java.util.List<com.jetbrains.test.boot4.server.quote.Quote> com.jetbrains.test.boot4.server.quote.QuoteRepository.findAllByAuthor(java.lang.String)\",\n  \"query\": {\n    \"query\": \"SELECT \\\"quote\\\".\\\"id\\\" AS \\\"id\\\", \\\"quote\\\".\\\"text\\\" AS \\\"text\\\", \\\"quote\\\".\\\"author\\\" AS \\\"author\\\", \\\"quote\\\".\\\"source\\\" AS \\\"source\\\" FROM \\\"quote\\\" WHERE \\\"quote\\\".\\\"author\\\" = :author\"\n  }\n}\nIf the generated query needs refinement, you can use the Inline Query action to insert it into a @Query annotation in the Spring Data repository code. \n\n\n\n\nThe annotated query will then be used as is during AOT generation.\nMost importantly, AOT-generated repository code is fully debuggable. You can place breakpoints directly inside the generated method and observe the exact query being executed – without navigating proxies or JDBC driver internals. \nRunning applications with AOT\nBy default, Spring Boot applications do not load AOT-generated classes. Neither ./gradlew bootRun nor ./mvnw spring-boot:run nor clicking on the green triangle icon in IntelliJ IDEA will load AOT-generated classes into the JVM. You need to explicitly instruct the runner to use them. To do this, you pass the -Dspring.aot.enabled=true flag for the application’s JVM. \nLet’s have a look at the required setup for both Gradle and Maven.\nGradle\nThe simplest way to pass the spring.aot.enabled flag is to modify the build.gradle.kts and add the following lines:\ntasks.named<BootRun>(\"bootRun\") {\n    if (project.hasProperty(\"aot\")) {\n        jvmArgs(\"-Dspring.aot.enabled=true\")\n        systemProperty(\"spring.profiles.active\", \"aot\")\n    }\n}\nThis will make Gradle search for the project property aot, bind its value to the system property spring.aot.enabled for the running application, and load a profile with DB connection properties. To run the application with AOT code, use the following command:\n./gradlew bootRun -Paot\nMaven\nFor Maven, you need to:\nExecute the package lifecycle phase to generate AOT classes before running the application.\nPass the spring.aot.enabled flag to the app JVM.\n\n\n\n\nIt is usually a good idea to make a separate Maven profile to run the application with AOT classes:   \n<profile>\n    <id>aot</id>\n    <properties>\n        <spring-boot.run.profiles>aot,localdb</spring-boot.run.profiles>\n        <spring-boot.run.jvmArguments>-Dspring.aot.enabled=true</spring-boot.run.jvmArguments>\n    </properties>\n    <build>\n        <plugins>\n            <plugin>\n                <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n                <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n                <executions>\n                    <execution>\n                        <id>process-aot</id>\n                        <goals>\n                            <goal>process-aot</goal>\n                        </goals>\n                    </execution>\n                </executions>\n            </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n    </build>\n</profile>\nNow you can run the application using:\n./mvnw -Paot package spring-boot:run\n💡 Note: Spring Boot’s automatic Docker Compose integration doesn’t currently work when the application is launched in AOT mode. If your project uses Docker Compose integration, start required services manually and configure the proper connection properties (for example, via a dedicated Spring profile). Please note the `localdb` profile string in the provided settings. \nDebugging AOT code with IntelliJ IDEA\nIntelliJ IDEA can run and debug an application that was started by Gradle or Maven. Just create a proper run configuration, and you’re good to go. \nFor Gradle:\n\n\n\n\nFor Maven:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA’s native build system still has limitations when dealing with AOT. So, if you’re aiming to debug AOT repositories, we advise you to build the code using the external build system, then run the application with IntelliJ IDEA, and pass system variables and profile values as required. The run configuration will look like this (assuming you’re using Maven):\n\n\n\n\nPlease note the following in the screenshot above:\nThe Before launch task\nThe JVM Args field with the spring.aot.enabled variable\n\n\n\n\nWith either of these run configurations, you’ll be able to start the application and debug AOT repositories, while also having access to Spring Debugger features.\n\n\n\n\nSeeing a real query string and ongoing transaction – isn’t it exciting? \nLimitations\nThey say that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. And that’s certainly true when working with AOT, which is why we must bear several important points in mind.\nSpring Data JDBC dialect requirement\nSpring Data JDBC currently requires a dialect bean for AOT mode:\n@Configuration\nclass AotConfiguration {\n    @Bean\n    JdbcDialect dialect() {\n        return JdbcPostgresDialect.INSTANCE;\n    }\n}\nThis requirement will probably be removed in subsequent Spring Boot 4 updates (see issue #47781). Now this workaround is mentioned in the documentation, but it’s easy to overlook. \nDevTools incompatibility\nIf you see the following strange error during startup:\njava.lang.IllegalAccessError: failed to access class org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigurationPackages$BasePackages \nfrom class org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigurationPackages__BeanDefinitions$BasePackages (org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigurationPackages$BasePackages \nis in unnamed module of loader 'app'; org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfigurationPackages__BeanDefinitions$BasePackages \nis in unnamed module of loader org.springframework.boot.devtools.restart.classloader.RestartClassLoader @2b4a127a)\nThere’s a good chance that DevTools is on the classpath. At the moment, AOT and DevTools are not fully compatible, so just disable DevTools, and the application will start normally.  \nConclusion\nSpring Data AOT repositories introduce several meaningful improvements:\nFaster application startup \nReduced memory usage\nBetter native image performance\nAnd most importantly: real visibility into behavior that used to be hidden behind proxies and reflection\n\n\n\n\nWith IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, you can now see the exact SQL or JPQL queries used by your application, navigate directly into the generated repository methods, and debug them just like any other code. This removes much of the guesswork associated with Spring Data behavior and lets you focus on what matters most – building clean, reliable business logic.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In the previous article, we saw how to build a basic coding agent with list, read, write, and edit capabilities. Today, we’ll dive into how to extend the agents’ capabilities by creating additional tools within the Koog framework. As an example, we’ll be building an ExecuteShellCommandTool, teaching our agent to run code and close the feedback loop that real engineering depends on: running the code, observing failures, and improving the code based on real output.\nWhile LLMs tend to be good at avoiding syntax errors, they do struggle with integration issues. For example, they have a tendency to call nonexistent methods, miss imports, and only partially implement interfaces. The traditional approach of compiling and running the code immediately exposes these problems. But with a little additional prompting, we can push the LLM to run small tests to validate these kinds of behavior.\nSo, how do we build such a tool? Let’s start with the fundamentals.\nWhat is the anatomy of a Koog tool?\nFirst, we start by inheriting from the abstract ai.koog.agents.core.tools.Tool class, which tells us that we need to provide:\nName: In our team, we like to follow the convention of snake_casing, surrounding the name with two underscores, though that’s just a matter of individual preference.\nDescription: This field serves as the main documentation for the LLM, explaining what the tool does and why it should be called.\nArgs class: This class describes the parameters that the LLM needs to or can provide when calling the tool.\nResult class: This class defines the data that will be formatted into a message for the LLM. It can contain a textForLLM() function that formats the data into a string for the LLM to read. The Result class exists mainly for developer convenience so it is easier to log or render the tool result in a UI. The agent itself only requires the formatted string.\nExecute() method: This method takes an instance of Args and returns an instance of Result. It defines the logic of what happens when the LLM calls the tool.\nThese components form the foundation of every Koog tool, whether you’re building a database connector, an API client, or, as we’ll see today, a shell command executor. Let’s walk through building an ExecuteShellCommandTool to see these principles in action.\nA quick aside on safety\nBefore we dive into the specifics of the ExecuteShellCommandTool, we need to address a few key safety considerations.\nWhile LLMs are not bad actors intentionally trying to cause us problems, they do occasionally make unexpected mistakes that can lead to issues down the line. And if we’re going to give them the power of command-line execution, their mistakes could have serious consequences.\nThere are several methods of mitigating this risk, however, including sandboxing command execution in isolated environments and/or limiting the permissions you grant them. However, these can be quite complicated to implement, and our focus now is on creating actual tools.\nWith this in mind, we’ll provide the two simplest risk mitigation strategies:\nCommand execution confirmation for every command. This is the safest option as long as we take a minute to review every command the LLM wants to execute, but it does seriously limit the agent’s autonomy.\nBrave mode, in which every command is approved automatically. While this mode can pose a risk to the machine you’re working on if it is not properly sandboxed, we’ll only be using it inside our own benchmarks, which run in isolated environments that can be destroyed without consequence.\nImplementing an ExecuteShellCommandTool\nFor our ExecuteShellCommandTool, these components are as follows:\nName: __execute_shell_command__.\nDescription: Something like “Executes shell commands and returns their output”.\nArgs class: command, timeoutSeconds, workingDirectory\nResult class: output, exitCode, command (might seem surprising, but is convenient to report in logs or UI what command was run).\nExecute() method: Request confirmation, then execute the command (we’ll look closely at the implementation details below).\nExecute() method implementation\nNow, let’s look at how we implement our execute() method. We keep the method simple by delegating core logic to helper methods as follows:\noverride suspend fun execute(args: Args): Result = when (\n        val confirmation = confirmationHandler.requestConfirmation(args)\n    ) {\n        is ShellCommandConfirmation.Approved -> try {\n            val result = executor.execute(\n                args.command, args.workingDirectory, args.timeoutSeconds\n            )\n            Result(args.command, result.exitCode, result.output)\n        } catch (e: CancellationException) {\n            throw e\n        } catch (e: Exception) {\n            Result(\n               args.command, null, \"Failed to execute command: ${e.message}\"\n            )\n        }\n\n        is ShellCommandConfirmation.Denied ->\n            Result(\n                args.command, null, \n                \"Command execution denied with user response: ${confirmation.userResponse}\"\n            )\n    }\nThe flow is straightforward: Request user confirmation for running the command, execute if this is approved via the command executor, or return the denial message to the LLM.\nThis also allows us to catch exceptions and forward error messages to the LLM, enabling it to adjust its approach or try alternatives.\nConfirmationHandler configuration\n\n\n\n\nConfirmationHandler becomes configurable when you create the ExecuteShellCommandTool, allowing for various implementations. Currently, we offer two:\nPrintShellCommandConfirmationHandler: Prompts the user via the command line.\nBraveModeConfirmationHandler: Automatically approves everything.\nThe second implementation just approves without any conditions, but the first has some interesting nuances:\noverride suspend fun requestConfirmation(\n        args: ExecuteShellCommandTool.Args\n    ): ShellCommandConfirmation {\n        println(\"Agent wants to execute: ${args.command}\")\n        args.workingDirectory?.let { println(\"In: $it\") }\n        println(\"Timeout: ${args.timeoutSeconds}s\")\n        print(\"Confirm (y / n / reason-for-denying): \")\n\n        val userResponse = readln().lowercase()\n        return when (userResponse) {\n            \"y\", \"yes\" -> ShellCommandConfirmation.Approved\n            else -> ShellCommandConfirmation.Denied(userResponse)\n        }\n    }\nNote that while users perceive three options (approve, deny, deny with reason), the implementation treats both denial types identically: Both return to the LLM, which interprets and handles each type appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommandExecutor configuration\nLike the ConfirmationHandler, the CommandExecutor is also configurable, though we currently only provide a JVM implementation. Theoretically, you could create implementations for Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and other platforms, but without clear demand, we’ll defer these for now.\nHow do we handle timeouts?\nRegardless of the platform used, one aspect of the CommandExecutor – timeout handling – deserves special attention. Our current implementation doesn’t allow the agent to interrupt long-running commands.\nHumans often act from an impatience heuristic, which can lead to them using Ctrl+C to cancel an execution. But this behavior assumes multi-threaded, agentic awareness and an underlying concept of impatience. However, there is a simpler and more intuitive alternative that fits this context much better.\nBy requiring the LLM to specify a maximum execution time, we can safely interrupt commands that exceed this limit. This timeout value is shown to users, allowing them to reject execution if the requested duration appears unreasonable or excessive.\nInstead of simply terminating the process and returning a generic timeout message, we should aim to preserve as much output as possible. Even incomplete results can help the LLM extract useful information, or at least understand where the timeout occurred. With careful implementation, we can achieve this:\nval stdoutJob = launch {\n    process.inputStream.bufferedReader().useLines { lines ->\n        try {\n            lines.forEach { stdoutBuilder.appendLine(it) }\n        } catch (_: IOException) {\n            // Ignore IO exception if the stream is closed and silently stop stream collection\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nval isCompleted = withTimeoutOrNull(timeoutSeconds * 1000L) {\n    process.onExit().await()\n} != null\n\nif (!isCompleted) {\n    process.destroyForcibly()\n}\n\nstdoutJob.join()\nWhat changed at the agent level?\nAt the agent level, the modifications are minimal, roughly a dozen lines of code. As the diff shows, the majority of these updates involve extending the system prompt.\n\n\n\n\nWe could have made our change even smaller by simply adding the tool, but instead, we also introduced two additional, though still minor, modifications to our agent.\nA) BRAVE_MODE toggle\nThe implementation of this toggle is relatively straightforward; it just checks the BRAVE_MODE environment variable. We even use a lambda function for the Brave mode ConfirmationHandler to show that implementing your own can be very simple, but one could also use the BraveModeConfirmationHandler that was mentioned earlier. \nfun createExecuteShellCommandToolFromEnv(): ExecuteShellCommandTool {\n    return if (System.getenv(\"BRAVE_MODE\")?.lowercase() == \"true\") {\n        ExecuteShellCommandTool(JvmShellCommandExecutor()) {\n            _ -> ShellCommandConfirmation.Approved \n        }\n    } else {\n        ExecuteShellCommandTool(\n            JvmShellCommandExecutor(), \n            PrintShellCommandConfirmationHandler(),\n        )\n    }\n}\nB) Enhanced “definition of done” in the prompt\nTo ensure the LLM leverages this new capability to execute code effectively, we extended the prompt with a “definition of done” that strongly encourages writing and running tests:\n\"\"\"\n... // Previous prompt from step 01\n\nProduction-ready means verified to work—your changes must be proven correct and not introduce regressions.\n\nYou have shell access to execute commands and run tests. Use this to work with executable feedback instead of assumptions. Establish what correct behavior looks like through tests, then iterate your implementation until tests pass. Validate that existing functionality remains intact. Production-ready means proven through green tests—that's your definition of done.\n\"\"\"\nSo that’s it. We’ve built a complete ExecuteShellCommandTool component and integrated it into our agent with minimal changes. But the real question is: Does it actually improve performance?\nBenchmark testing results\nRunning both versions against the SWE-bench-verified set confirms the execution capabilities provide a clear benefit: The agent’s performance improved from 249/500 (50%) to 279/500 (56%) successful examples. While leaderboard scores reach around 70%, our results indicate that giving agents the ability to run and validate code is a step in the right direction. However, to understand where our agent is still struggling and what to improve next, we need better visibility into its behavior. That’s where logging becomes essential.\nConclusion: Building tools in Koog\nThroughout this article, we’ve seen how Koog’s tool structure works: Every tool needs a name, description and execute() method. We made our ExecuteShellCommandTool configurable via ConfirmationHandler and CommandExecutor components, showing how to delegate complex logic to swappable implementations.\nThese same patterns apply to any tool you might want to build: database connectors, API clients, file processors, or custom integrations. The framework provides the structure for LLM communication; you provide the specific capabilities. \nIn the next article, we’ll look at how to add logging and tracing to our agent, giving us the visibility we need to understand and improve its behavior. Understanding how your agent makes decisions is crucial for iteration, and proper tooling around observability is just as important as the tools you give the agent itself.",

Whether you are looking for architectural inspiration, hard data to convince your stakeholders, or just want to understand the engineering magic under the hood, the answers are out there.\n\n\n\n\nHere is your KMP marathon for the week.\n🌍 Part 1: Production Case Studies\nTheory is nice, but does it scale? These teams proved it does.\nDuolingo + KMP: A Case Study in Productivity |  John Rodriguez & Johnny Ye (2025)\nDuolingo ships weekly to 40M+ daily users across Android, iOS, and Web. Shipping that fast requires efficiency. This talk breaks down their specific rubric for deciding what to share, from Video Calls to Math lessons, and how they handle the velocity required to ship constantly without breaking platform quality.\nLeveraging KMP for Navigation in the McDonald’s App  | Cas van Luijtelaar & Anthony Bassey (2025)\nMost teams start by sharing the data layer, but McDonald’s went much further. They use KMP to drive the navigation state itself. In this talk, they show how they keep the UI 100% native (Compose & SwiftUI) but let the shared KMP layer decide where to go and what data to pass, effectively creating a scalable “dumb client” architecture.\nTwo Years with KMP: From Zero to 55% Shared Code | Rodrigo Sicarelli (2024)\nStoneCo is a fintech giant serving 4 million users. This isn’t a “hello world” story; it’s about training 130 mobile engineers to shift their paradigm. They break down how they achieved 55% code sharing across two massive apps and the measurable impact on developer satisfaction and velocity.\nMeetup with KMM Libraries | Colin Lee (2023)\nIf you are overwhelmed by the library ecosystem, watch this. Colin walks through the transition from a legacy codebase to a greenfield KMP app. He highlights the specific stack that saved them (Apollo GraphQL, SQLDelight, Moko Resources) and how they survived the initial “panic” from the iOS team to reach a point where everyone loves the shared workflow.\n\n\n\n\n🛠️ Part 2: Getting Your Hands Dirty\nOkay, you’re inspired. Now let’s look at the code.\nCompose Multiplatform for iOS: Ready for Production | Sebastian Aigner (2025)\nCompose Multiplatform is no longer experimental—it’s stable on iOS. Sebastian gives you the tour of the ecosystem, showing how to build production-grade UIs that share rendering logic while still feeling at home on Apple devices. Perfect for understanding the current state of the art.\nConfetti: Building a Conference App in 40 Minutes | John O’Reilly & Martin Bonnin (2023)\nThis is a live-coding masterclass in “Full Stack Kotlin.” Watch John and Martin build a working app from scratch in real-time. They spin up a Spring Boot backend with GraphQL, generate type-safe Kotlin models on the client with Apollo, and wire it up to native UIs (Compose & SwiftUI). It’s the best demo of how tight the loop can be when you use Kotlin end-to-end.\n\n\n\n\n🍎 Part 3: The iOS Perspective\nBecause your iOS teammates need to love this too.\nKMP in Action: A Production Case Study | Annyce Davis (2024)\nConvincing an iOS team is often the hardest part of adoption. Annyce details Meetup’s migration, specifically focusing on the “WIIFM” (What’s In It For Me) factor for skeptical engineers. The killer insight: after migrating networking to KMP, their iOS app actually got faster because it inherited optimized caching logic that was previously missing.\nKotlin Multiplatform for iOS Developers | Salomon Brys (2023)\nKMP is often pitched to Android devs, but what about the other side of the aisle? Salomon steps “behind enemy lines” to explain KMP from an iOS perspective. He covers the toolchain, the limitations, and how to create a workflow that doesn’t make iOS developers feel like second-class citizens.\nℹ️ The ecosystem has grown significantly since 2023. New features like experimental Swift Export now allow idiomatic Swift calls without Objective-C headers. However, Salomon’s core advice on team dynamics and workflow remains essential viewing.\n\n\n\n\n🤿 Part 4: The Deep Dive\nFor those who want to see how the magic trick is performed.\nUsing C & native platforms in Kotlin: Building a multi-platform advanced library | Salomon Brys (2024)\nSometimes you need to go low-level. Using cryptography as an excuse, this talk demonstrates how to build an advanced library that links against native C dependencies, aligns JNI with Kotlin/Native C-interop, and connects to Swift SDKs. Essential viewing for library authors.\nImplementing Compose Hot Reload | Sebastian Sellmair (2025)\nHot Reload is a productivity game-changer, but implementing it on the JVM required deep engineering work. Sebastian breaks down the journey, from fighting ClassLoaders to patching the Kotlin Compiler to handle “shifting lambda names.” A fascinating look under the hood of the tooling we take for granted.\n📺 Want to watch them all in one go? We’ve compiled every talk from this list into a single KMP Level Up Playlist on YouTube. Save it to your library and start your marathon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎫 Join us in the Real World\nThese talks represent the current state of the art, but the ecosystem is moving fast. The best way to stay ahead is to be where the conversations happen.\nKotlinConf 2026 tickets are on sale now!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Amper 0.9.0 is out, and it brings the first version of our extensibility prototype! Read on for all of the details, and see the release notes for the full list of changes and bug fixes.\nTo get support for Amper’s latest features, use IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 Beta (or newer).\nNew Amper website\nWe revamped our documentation and turned it into a brand new website! You no longer have to read Markdown files on GitHub. We hope you’ll enjoy the new structure, as well as the navigation and search functionality.\nCheck it out at https://amper.org.\n\n\n\n\nExtensibility preview\nIt’s finally here: our first preview of Amper’s extensibility!\nOur philosophy is to give a “batteries included” experience to our users, and this is why we want Amper to cover the most common use cases out of the box. However, a lot of projects have special needs, and the built-in behavior falls short eventually. To address this, Amper now offers the option to write custom tasks and expose them to your modules via plugins.\nNote: Only local plugins are supported at the moment, but we will soon add the ability to publish and share plugins.\nIn Amper 0.9.0, you can create modules with the new jvm/amper-plugin product type. These modules contain the Kotlin code implementing your custom tasks, and a plugin.yaml file to register your tasks and their inputs and outputs.\nWhy do you need to use both Kotlin and YAML? As usual with Amper, tooling is paramount. Thanks to this approach, you will get nice diagnostics in case you make mistakes with your task wiring. Don’t worry, though, navigating between YAML and Kotlin is already seamless with the current basic IDE support.\n\n\n\n\nTask dependencies are automatically inferred based on inputs and outputs, and task avoidance is already available by default. Inputs can be simple scalar values or files, or even your module’s compile or runtime classpath – thanks to the built-in Classpath type. Outputs can be regular files, but they can also be registered as generated sources or resources so the rest of the build takes them into account.\nBuild your own plugin from scratch by following our plugin quick-start guide, and tell us what you think in our Slack channel or in a YouTrack issue.\nPlease bear in mind that this preview is incomplete, and many more features will come in the future, including:\nThe ability to publish plugins and share them with other projects.\nTemplates that are bundled with your plugin to add configuration to the consumer module.\nReduced boilerplate when writing tasks that are only used in a single module.\nServices and libraries for common task-authoring needs.\nMore IDE quick-fixes and intention actions.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the current and future state in our plugin documentation.\nDependency resolution performance improvements\nThe dependency resolution phase was previously a performance bottleneck, especially during IDE import and sync.\nEven though all downloaded files are locally cached and reused, building the dependency graph itself takes time, as Amper needs to read all the local pom.xml and Gradle metadata files. Amper now caches the dependency graph itself and reuses it when your dependencies haven’t changed, which can sometimes save tens of seconds on hot caches!\nThere is certainly more we can do here, and we’ll continue improving dependency resolution performance, so stay tuned!\nIncremental compilation for Java\nAmper has had task avoidance since day one, which means that it skips the whole compilation task of a module if its sources and dependencies haven’t changed. However, this doesn’t help if you have a large module with lots of sources, because any change in any file will cause the recompilation of the whole module.\nThis is where incremental compilation comes in. In Amper 0.9.0, you can use our incremental Java compilation engine, which recompiles only what’s necessary based on the exact changes in the module sources. Any change in your sources will still cause the compilation task to run, but now the task itself will be faster.\nTo enable this feature, simply add the following to your module.yaml file:\nsettings:\n  java:\n    compileIncrementally: true\nMaven-like layout support\nAmper’s default directory layout is simple and concise, and we love it. That said, we do understand that transitioning from Maven or Gradle is quite tedious and error-prone if it involves moving all files around. This is particularly painful if you want to try out Amper in a separate long-lived Git branch and get updates from your main branch.\nAs of Amper 0.9.0, you can choose to keep your sources and resources in the conventional Maven directory layout, so you don’t have to move your existing files immediately:\n\nTo do so, add layout: maven-like to your module.yaml file. If you intend to do this for all your modules, use a template to handle this in a central place.\nNote: The maven-like layout is only available for the “jvm/app” and “jvm/lib” product types.\nLibrary catalog at the project root\nAmper now supports placing your Gradle-style version catalog (libs.versions.toml) in the project root instead of in the gradle folder. Of course, you are free to keep using gradle/libs.versions.toml if you want to keep compatibility with your Gradle layout.\nIn the IDE, using intention actions to extract dependencies to a new catalog will now create the catalog in the project root.\nNote: You can only use a single library catalog for your project, so you have to pick one of the locations.\nIDE improvements\nAuto-sync of the project configuration\nChanges to your Amper configuration files are now automatically taken into account, which means you no longer need to manually click the Sync  button!\nThis was made possible by the improvements in dependency resolution caching we’ve seen above.\nIf syncing involves downloading new dependencies or other lengthy processes, you’ll see a progress indicator in the status bar; otherwise, the sync should be seamless.\n\n\n\n                    \nNote: This behavior can be configured for the current project in “Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools”. If you want to change the default for future new projects, you can do so in “Settings | Advanced Settings | Build Tools. Amper”.\nSync details\nThe Build tool window now provides more insights into the stages of the sync process, and shows errors and warnings arising from them.\n\n\nIDE assistance for setting the main class\nYou can configure the entrypoint of a jvm/app module using settings.jvm.mainClass. Finding the fully-qualified name of your main class is never fun, though. This is why IntelliJ IDEA now provides completion for it directly in your YAML file!\nThe completion list includes all class names that have a valid main function. By default, only classes present in the module itself are shown, but you can also invoke completion a second time to get results from your dependencies too:\n\n\n\n\nThat’s not all. IntelliJ IDEA also provides assistance with navigation and resolution, and it will even warn you about the infamous missing Kt suffix when referring to the class Kotlin generates for top-level main functions.\n\nImproved quick-fix for overridden catalog versions\nAmper warns you when your module doesn’t get the requested version of a dependency because of dependency conflicts. However, when this happens with a library catalog dependency, it isn’t obvious what the fix should be, as it depends on your intent.\nTo address this issue, IntelliJ IDEA now offers two different quick-fixes: one to replace the catalog reference with an explicit version in the problematic module, and one to update the version in the catalog itself. Use Alt+Enter or click the More actions… option in the warning tooltip to access these fixes:\n\n\n\n\n\nDedicated color theme settings\nYou can now customize the colors in your Amper YAML files.\nHead over to File | Settings | Editor | Color Scheme | Amper and get creative!\n\nUpdated default versions\nWe updated some of our default versions for toolchains and frameworks:\nKotlin 2.2.21\nCompose Hot Reload 1.0.0-rc01\nKSP 2.3.0\nJUnit Platform 6.0.1\n\n\n\n\nAlso, the default value for settings.jvm.release is now 21.\nTry Amper 0.9.0\nTo update an existing project, use the ./amper update command.\nTo get started with Amper, check out our Getting started guide. Take a look at some examples, follow a tutorial, or read the comprehensive user guide depending on your learning style.\nTry Amper\n                                                    \nShare your feedback\nAmper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a YouTrack issue. Your input and use cases help shape the future of Amper!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the fifth post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nAll parts in the series:\nGetting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nEvaluating Kotlin in Real Projects\nGrowing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company\nHelping Decision-Makers Say Yes to Kotlin\nScaling Kotlin Adoption Across Your Organization\nSuccess Factors for Large-Scale Kotlin Adoption\nGaining developer buy-in and management support for Kotlin is a significant milestone, but it’s not the finish line. The real challenge begins when you’re faced with existing Java codebases that need to coexist with or transition to Kotlin. How do you navigate this hybrid world effectively?\nThe key to managing legacy codebases is developing a strategy that aligns with your organizational goals and operational realities. Here’s a proven approach that has worked out well in practice.\nApplication lifecycle strategy\nDifferent applications require different approaches based on their lifecycle phase. Let’s examine three distinct categories:\nEnd-of-life applications\nStrategy: Leave them alone.\nIf an application is scheduled for retirement, there’s no business case for migration. Keep these systems in Java and focus your energy where it matters most. The cost of migration will never be justified by the remaining lifespan of the application.\nNew systems\nStrategy: Default to Kotlin.\nIn organizations where Kotlin adoption is complete, greenfield projects naturally start with Kotlin. If the adoption process is in progress, teams often get the choice between Java and Kotlin. Choose wisely ;-).\nActive applications\nStrategy: Pragmatic, feature-driven migration.\nActive applications are the ones that require careful consideration: Rewriting for the sake of rewriting is a tough sell to your Product Owner. Instead, combine migration efforts with new feature development. This approach provides tangible business value while modernizing your codebase. The different attack angles we already discussed in the section: Extend/Convert an existing Java application.\nJava-to-Kotlin conversion approaches\nWhen converting Java to Kotlin, you have several options, each with distinct trade-offs:\n1. Complete rewrite\nBest for: Small codebases \nChallenge: Time-intensive for larger systems\nRewriting a codebase from scratch gives you the cleanest, most idiomatic Kotlin code. This approach is suitable for small codebases, like a MicroService. For large codebases, this approach generally tends to be prohibitively expensive.\n2. IDE auto-conversion with manual refinement\nBest for: Medium codebases with dedicated refactoring time\nChallenge: Manual refinements are mandatory \nIntelliJ IDEA’s Convert Java to Kotlin feature provides a literal translation that’s far from idiomatic. Consider this example:\nTake 1: \nJava\nrecord Developer(\n       String name,\n       List<String> languages\n) {}\nRaw auto-conversion result:\nKotlin\n@JvmRecord\ndata class Developer(\n   val name: String?,\n   val languages: MutableList<String?>?\n)\nThis conversion has several issues:\nEverything becomes nullable (overly defensive).\nJava Collections become Kotlin’s MutableList instead of  Kotlin’s default read-only List.\nImproving the conversion with jspecify annotations:\nLuckily, for the conversion of all Java types to Nullable types in Kotlin, there is a remedy in the form of @NonNull/@Nullable annotations. Different options are available; the most modern one is jspecify, which has recently also been officially supported by Spring:\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.jspecify</groupId>\n   <artifactId>jspecify</artifactId>\n   <version>1.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n\nimplementation(\"org.jspecify:jspecify:1.0.0\")\nWith jspecify, we can annotate the Java code with @Nullable and @NonNull.\nTake 2: \nJava\nimport org.jspecify.annotations.NonNull;\nimport org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable;\n\nrecord Developer(\n       @NonNull String name, \n       @NonNull List<@NonNull String> languages,\n       @Nullable String email\n) {}\nNow the auto-conversion produces much better results:\nKotlin\n@JvmRecord\ndata class Developer(\n   //😃 non-null as requested\n   val name: String, \n   //😃 both, collection and type are non-null\n  val languages: MutableList<String>,\n   //😃 nullable as requested\n  val email: String?, \n)\nLimitations of the auto conversion approach:\nEven with jspecify annotations, complex Java patterns don’t translate well. Consider this auto-converted code example shown in section: 3. No more checked Exceptions, yet safer code in Kotlin:\nKotlin\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: MutableList<String>): String? {\n     //🤨 using Stream, instead of Kotlin Collections\n     val contents = urls.stream().map { urlStr: String? ->\n     //🤨 still using Optional, rather than Nullable types\n     //🤨 var but we want val!\n     var optional: Optional<URL>\n     //🤨 useless try-catch, no need to catch in Kotlin\n     try {\n         optional = Optional.of(URI(urlStr).toURL())\n     } catch (e: URISyntaxException) {\n           optional = Optional.empty<URL>()\n     } catch (e: MalformedURLException) {\n           optional = Optional.empty<URL>()\n     }\n     optional\n   }.filter { it!!.isPresent() }//🤨 discouraged !! to force conversion to non-null\n    .map {it.get() }\n    .map { url: URL ->\n      //🤨 useless try-catch, no need to catch in Kotlin\n      try {\n        url.openStream().use { `is` -> \n           String(`is`.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8)\n        }\n      } catch (e: IOException) {\n         throw IllegalArgumentException(e)\n       }\n    }.toList()\n   //🤨 usage of Java collections…\n   return Collections.max(contents)\n}\nThe autoconversion is far away from the desired, idiomatic result:\nKotlin\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List<String>): String? =\n   urls.mapNotNull {\n       runCatching { URI(it).toURL() }.getOrNull()\n   }.maxOfOrNull{ it.openStream().use{ it.reader().readText() } }\nThe auto-conversion provides a starting point, but significant manual refinement and knowledge of idiomatic Kotlin is required to achieve truly idiomatic Kotlin.\n3. AI-assisted conversion\nBest for: Larger codebases with robust testing infrastructure\nChallenge: Manual review required\nAI can potentially produce more idiomatic results than basic auto-conversion, but success requires careful preparation:\nPrerequisites:\nComprehensive testing coverage: Since LLMs are unpredictable, you need reliable tests to catch AI hallucinations.\nWell-crafted system prompts: Create detailed instructions for idiomatic Kotlin conversions that are aligned with your standards. You can use this system prompt as a starting point.\nExtensive code review: AI output requires a thorough review for logical and idiomatic correctness, which can be mentally taxing for large codebases.\nUsing the proposed system prompt to guide the conversion, the result is quite satisfying, yet not perfect:\nKotlin\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List<String>): String? {\n   val contents = urls\n      .mapNotNull { \n            urlStr -> runCatching { URI(urlStr).toURL() }.getOrNull() \n      }.mapNotNull { url -> runCatching { \n            url.openStream().use { it.readAllBytes().toString(UTF_8)\n         } \n      }.getOrNull() }\n\n   return contents.maxOrNull()\n}\n4. Auto-conversion at scale\nBest for: Massive codebases requiring systematic transformation\nCurrently, there’s no official tooling for converting Java codebases to idiomatic Kotlin at scale. However, both Meta and Uber have successfully tackled this challenge for their Android codebases using approaches that work equally well for backend applications. The following documentation and talks provide insights into how Meta and Uber approach this quest:\nMeta’s approach:                                                                                    \n \nStrategy: Rule-based, deterministic transformation\nResources:                                                                                               \n\nEngineering blog post\nConference talk                           \nUber’s approach:                                                                                 \n \nStrategy: Rule-based, deterministic transformation using AI to generate conversion rules\nResource: KotlinConf presentation\nBoth companies succeeded by creating systematic, repeatable processes rather than relying on manual conversion or simple automation. Their rule-based approaches ensure consistency and quality across millions of lines of code.\nImportant: Converting Java to Kotlin at scale introduces a challenge on the social level: to be reliable, you still want ‘the human in the loop’ reviewing the generated code. However, if not planned carefully, Engineers can easily be overwhelmed by the flood of pull requests resulting from the automated conversion. Therefore, the social impact needs to be considered carefully. \nRemember, successful large-scale Kotlin adoption isn’t just about converting code – it’s about building team expertise, establishing coding standards, and creating sustainable processes that deliver long-term value to your organization.\nShort recap on when to use which approach:\nSmall application or being rewritten anyway?\n→ Rewrite in Kotlin (1)\n\nMedium codebases with dedicated refactoring time or team learning Kotlin?\n→ Intellij IDEA Auto-Conversion + refine (start with tests first) (2)\n\n\n\n\nMid/large code with repeated patterns and good tests?\n→ AI-assisted approach (3) \n\nOrg-level migration to Kotlin across many services?\n→ Auto-Conversion at scale with concrete plan (platform-led) (4)\nUnlock Kotlin’s full potential\nKotlin makes developers productive fast. Its concise syntax, safety features, and rich standard library help many developers write better code within weeks – often through self-study or on-the-job learning. But without guidance, many fall into the trap of using Kotlin in a Java-like way: sticking to mutable structures, verbose patterns, and missing out on idiomatic features.\nReaching the next level\nReaching the next level – embracing immutability, expression-oriented code, DSLs, and structured concurrency with Coroutines (with or without Virtual Threads) – is where many developers get stuck.\nAt this stage, I’ve found that external training makes a far greater difference than self-study. Even developers with years of Kotlin experience often benefit from focused coaching to adopt idiomatic patterns and unlock the language’s full potential.\n\n\n\n\nTo Kotlin or Not to Kotlin: What Kind of Company Do You Want to Be?\nUltimately, the decision to adopt Kotlin reflects your engineering culture. Do you value the:\nTraditional approach (Java): Conservative, ceremonial, stable.\nProgressive approach (Kotlin): Pragmatic, modern, adaptive.\nBoth have their merits. Java will get the job done. Kotlin will likely get it done better, with happier developers and fewer bugs. The question isn’t whether Kotlin is better – it’s whether your organization is ready to invest in being better.\nThe journey from that first Kotlin test to organization-wide adoption isn’t always smooth, but with the right approach, it’s remarkably predictable. Start small, prove value, build community, and scale thoughtfully.\nYour developers – current and future – will thank you.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring Boot 4.0 has officially landed. At JetBrains, we’ve been tracking the updates since the first milestones to ensure that IntelliJ IDEA delivers a smooth and reliable development experience.\nWhile many of the core capabilities come directly from Spring Framework 7, Spring Boot remains the adoption enabler that brings everything together: sensible defaults, consistent configuration, unified starters, and the familiar lightning-fast productivity when creating applications.\nAs the most popular framework in the Java world, Spring Boot also helps developers move from older JDK versions to newer ones that offer better performance, more efficient garbage collectors, and modern language features.\nThis major Spring Boot release introduces cleaner modularization to reduce memory usage, improved observability with Micrometer, JSpecify as the standard null-safety library, and many other small improvements that streamline daily development.\nFor JetBrains, the biggest news in Spring Boot 4 is that Kotlin 2.2 is now the official baseline version for the framework. This milestone is the result of a long-standing collaboration between the JetBrains Kotlin team and the Spring Framework team.\nLet’s take a closer look at Spring Boot 4’s new features through the lens of Kotlin 2.2. \nNullability\nThe Kotlin compiler and IntelliJ IDEA now support JSpecify annotations natively. You will receive a compiler warning if you use JSpecify-annotated Java code incorrectly. In addition, IntelliJ IDEA will warn you if you try to assign a Java variable annotated with @Nullable to a non-nullable variable in Kotlin, and vice versa. \nFor example, for the Java interface:\n@NullMarked\n\npublic interface QuoteProvider {\n\n    Quote findQuote(String text);\n\n}\nA Kotlin implementation must return a non-nullable Quote object from the overridden findQuote() method:\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll see the following error message:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA detects the issue and suggests changing the return type to non-nullable. JSpecify is now the default library for nullability checks across all Spring projects. This means that when you create a Spring Boot 4 project in Kotlin, you can be sure that the framework types that you use are null-aware. \nAPI versioning\nAPI versioning in Kotlin works much the same way as in Java. Thanks to Spring’s well-designed API versioning mechanism, adding a version takes only a few lines of configuration and a single annotation attribute. In Kotlin, the versioned API looks just as straightforward:\n@RestController\n\n@RequestMapping(\"/api\", produces = [MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE])\n\nclass QuoteController(private val klient: QuoteKlient) {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"quote\", version = \"1.0\")\n\n    fun fetchRandomQuote(): ResponseEntity<Quote> = \nResponseEntity.ok(klient.fetchRandomQuote())\n\n    @GetMapping(\"quote\", version = \"2.0\")\n\n    fun fetchRandomQuotes(): ResponseEntity<List<Quote>> = \nResponseEntity.ok(klient.fetchRandomQuotes())\n\n}\nThere’s nothing fancy here, just the usual Kotlin conciseness, with IntelliJ IDEA inspections helping you configure and validate version formats. \nBean registration\nBean registration is one of the areas where Kotlin truly shines. Thanks to its expressiveness and extensibility, it provides a powerful DSL for registering beans dynamically when the regular @ConditionalOn… annotation family is insufficient.\nFor example, instead of the following Java code:\npublic class QuoteProviderRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderDb\", QuoteProviderDb.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderFallback\",\n\n                QuoteProviderFallback.class,\n\n                spec -> {\n\n                    spec.fallback();\n\n                    spec.order(1);\n\n                }\n\n        );\n\n    }\n\n}\nYou can write a more elegant version without all the .class calls and lambda boilerplate:\nclass KuoteProviderRegistrar : BeanRegistrarDsl({\n\n    registerBean<QuoteProviderDb>(\"quoteProviderDb\")\n\n    registerBean<QuoteProviderFallback>(\n\n        name = \"quoteProviderFallback\",\n\n        fallback = true,\n\n        order = 1\n\n    )\n\n})\nMuch cleaner, right? \nConclusion\nSpring Boot is the most popular framework for Java development – and for good reason. With Spring Boot 4 establishing Kotlin 2.2 as the baseline and offering first-class support, we expect to see even broader Kotlin adoption among backend developers who want to use the latest language features. \nYou can try Spring Boot 4 in the 2025.3 Beta release or wait for the stable version, which is expected in early December.\nAt JetBrains, we continue to work closely with the Spring Framework team to ensure Kotlin remains well-integrated and fully supported in the Spring ecosystem.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The release of Visual Studio 2026 two weeks ago marks the next evolution in Microsoft’s 50-year commitment to deliver the tools that developers love and enterprises trust, built to move at the pace of modern development. Software development is moving faster than ever, and Visual Studio is evolving right along with you.\nToday, we’re announcing an important step forward in the lifecycle and release cadence for Visual Studio. Visual Studio will be a continuously updated modern IDE designed to deliver innovation as soon as it is ready, while maintaining the reliability and stability you count on every day. We’ll deliver this through monthly feature updates and a new annual major release.\nWhy We’re Modernizing\nVisual Studio now innovates at the pace of modern software. Whether you build desktop apps, cloud services, games, web APIs, or AI agents, the IDE will now ship the latest performance and capability improvements every month, with GitHub Copilot experiences always up to date.\nWe also heard the request for frictionless updates. Your existing projects, solutions, and extensions continue to work as they do today. We’re maintaining a high compatibility bar across monthly and annual releases, so you stay productive while the IDE evolves in place and your builds remain stable.\nBecause the IDE is decoupled from the build tools, these changes do not require you to modify existing projects or rebuild working applications. Visual Studio updates monthly, but your .NET or C++ compiler build tools, runtimes, and extensions continue to work exactly as before. Build tools and SDKs have their own multi-year lifecycles, so your build environment remains stable even as the IDE gets new features.\nBuilt for Modern Development\nSince Visual Studio 2017, we have been steadily increasing our release cadence, delivering quarterly feature updates, servicing releases, and flexible build tools choices. With Visual Studio 2026, we are taking the next step, moving to a modern support lifecycle that keeps you on the latest tools and features automatically.\nThis new approach means:\nFeature updates every month, not every quarter.\nA new annual version each year, released in November alongside the .NET release.\nPredictable servicing and support under the Modern Support Lifecycle, with one year of monthly feature updates followed by one year of security fixes.\nUpdate to the latest release to remain supported and serviced with new features, fixes, and security updates.\nIt is all about giving you updates as soon as they are ready.\nBuild Tools Freedom – You Are in Control\nWith these changes to how Visual Studio is updated and supported, it’s equally important to understand how build tools and components fit into this new model.\nWe know every team moves at its own pace. Visual Studio continues to carry a wide range of build tools and components to target the platforms you’ve come to expect. With multiple supported versions of these build tools included, you can choose when to move your projects forward. You can adopt the latest compiler, runtime, or SDK on your schedule while still benefiting from IDE improvements and AI features each month.\nThese build tools, SDKs, and runtimes are available under their own support lifecycles. For example, modern .NET releases every year, with Standard Term Support (STS) for 2 years and Long-Term Support (LTS) support for 3 years. The lifecycle for .NET Framework is tied to the Windows release in which it ships.\nFor C++ developers, we are also decoupling the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compilers and Build Tools from the Visual Studio lifecycle. This lets the compiler team ship faster, more agile updates every six months, with long-term supported versions every 2 years. For more details, see today’s blog post on the new MSVC lifecycle.\nInsiders and Stable Channels\nTo support this faster cadence, starting with Visual Studio 2026 two channels are available:\nInsiders Channel – Try upcoming features first, share feedback, and help shape what is next. To install go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/insiders/. (Insiders replaces the “Preview” Channel previously available.)\nStable Channel – Get validated, production-ready features every month. To install, go to https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/. (Stable replaces the “Current” Channel previously available.)\nFeatures that appear in the Insiders Channel will roll into the Stable Channel when they’re ready for broad adoption. If you are on Stable, you will receive a monthly feature update and servicing releases as needed. (For more information, see Visual Studio Channels and Release Rhythm and Visual Studio Product Lifecycle and Servicing.)\nEach year, the IDE will update to the next annual version, for example next November, Visual Studio 2026 will update in place to Visual Studio 2027, with no disruption to your environment.\nOur enterprise customers at times need more flexibility in when they schedule updates. To ensure they are fully supported, we’ll also offer a side-by-side Long-Term-Servicing Channel (LTSC) for the prior annual release. The LTSC provides security servicing for 1 year. For example, in November of 2026, you will be able to choose to switch to the Visual Studio 2026 LTS Channel to remain on a static feature set for an additional year.\nHowever, it’s important to note that Visual Studio LTSC is not necessary to maintain your project in a known state. If your project uses .NET 10 or MSVC 14.50 that ship with Visual Studio 2026, when you update to Visual Studio 2027 those build tools will still be available, and your projects should just build as before.\nFlexible Licensing and Registration\nThese changes for Visual Studio result in a shift in how we handle product registration. There are no changes to Visual Studio Community, it remains free for open-source projects, education, and small organizations. (See the license for details.)\nFor the Professional and Enterprise editions, if you have a Visual Studio Subscription, there’s no change to the registration process. You will continue signing in as before and automatically receive updates through the modern lifecycle or obtain your product key from the Visual Studio Subscribers portal. If you use a stand-alone Professional license, you simply purchase the new annual version each year. Product keys will continue to work for that annual version, and new keys will unlock the next year’s release.\nAdditionally, there are no changes to the lifecycle for Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio 2019, and Visual Studio 2017.\nAlways Current, Always Ready\nVisual Studio 2026 marks the start of a new era, an IDE that is modern, intelligent, and continuously improving. You will spend less time waiting for updates and more time building great software with the latest tools.\nWe are excited for you to experience this new cadence, share your feedback, and help shape the future of Visual Studio. The journey continues, and Visual Studio will be right there with you, every month, every release.\nThe post Visual Studio – Built for the Speed of Modern Development appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "복잡한 웹사이트 기획부터 코딩, 배포까지 단 5분 만에 끝낼 수 있다면 어떠세요? 2025년, AI 기술의 발전은 더 이상 꿈이 아닙니다. 비개발자도 전문가급 랜딩페이지를 만들고 싶은 분들을 위해, AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트가 어떻게 이 모든 과정을 혁신하는지 자세히 알아보겠습니다. 이제 여러분의 상상이 현실이 되는 시대가 도래했습니다.\n  왜 랜딩페이지가 필요할까요?\n\n\n음, 생각해 보면 많은 분들이 거창한 웹 애플리케이션보다는 자신을 소개하거나 특정 서비스를 홍보할 수 있는 간단하면서도 전문적인 랜딩페이지 하나를 더 필요로 하시는 것 같아요. 특히 개발 취업을 준비 중인 분들이나, 개인 사업을 시작하려는 분들에게는 명함처럼 내밀 수 있는 포트폴리오 사이트나 회사 홍보 페이지가 정말 필수적이죠.\n그런데 막상 만들려고 하면 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 막막할 때가 많습니다. 코딩 지식이 없어서 못 만드는 것보다, 사실은 '어떤 내용을 담아야 할까?', '디자인은 어떻게 해야 촌스럽지 않을까?' 같은 기획 단계에서부터 좌절하는 경우가 태반이에요. 저도 주변에서 그런 어려움을 자주 접하곤 했습니다.\n  '랜딩페이지 메이커' 젬 지침의 탄생과 한계\n이런 문제를 해결하고자 제가 처음 시도했던 것이 바로 '랜딩페이지 메이커' 젬(GEM) 지침입니다. 이 지침은 AI에게 랜딩페이지 제작에 필요한 모든 단계를 아주 구체적으로 알려주는 매뉴얼이라고 할 수 있죠. 크게 세 부분으로 나뉩니다.\nRole (역할): AI에게 구글의 수석 UX/UI 디자이너이자 전문 카피라이터라는 정체성을 부여합니다. 단순히 구조만 설계하는 것을 넘어, 사용자의 심리를 꿰뚫는 매력적인 문구와 실제 개발 가능한 수준의 디테일한 기획력을 갖추도록 명시했죠.\nContext (맥락): 최종 목표를 '메인 페이지와 4개의 서브 페이지가 완벽하게 연결된 고품질 웹사이트 제작'으로 설정하고, 웹사이트 주제, 타겟 고객, 핵심 목표를 입력받도록 했습니다.\nTask & Process (작업 절차): 이 부분이 핵심인데요. 총 3단계로 구성됩니다.\n\n스텝 1. 브랜드 아이덴티티: 사이트맵, Primary Color(Hex Code와 선택 이유), Typography, Mood Board(형용사 3가지)를 구체적으로 지시합니다.\n스텝 2. 메인 페이지 상세 기획: Hero Section (헤드라인, 서브 텍스트, CTA 버튼 2개), Problem & Solution, Key Features 3개, Social Proof까지 실제 들어갈 문구를 모두 작성하도록 합니다.\n스텝 3. 서브 페이지 4종: 각 페이지의 제목, 목표, 헤더 카피, 핵심 바디 콘텐츠, CTA를 상세하게 작성하도록 지시합니다.\n이 젬 지침을 활용하면, '열린 입 치과 의원 홈페이지'처럼 간단한 입력만으로도 브랜드 아이덴티티부터 아주 구체적인 UX/UI 방법론이 포함된 랜딩페이지 생성 지침을 바로 받아볼 수 있었습니다. 심지어 이 기획안을 기반으로 실제 코드를 짜서 프로토타입을 미리 확인하는 것도 가능했죠.\n⚠️ 하지만 젬 지침은 한 번 등록하면 제미나이에서 바로 사용 가능하고 응답도 빠르다는 장점이 있지만, 때로는 출력물의 내용이 많거나 복잡할 때 우리가 원하는 만큼 일관성 있는 결과를 제공하지 못하는 한계가 있었습니다. \n*GEM지침원본은 본문 하단에 있습니다.\n  2025년의 해결책: AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트\n이러한 한계를 극복하고 더 일관성 있고 강력한 결과물을 얻기 위해 앱으로 구현한 것이 바로 오늘 여러분께 소개해 드릴 'AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트'입니다. 2025년 현재, 이 앱은 랜딩페이지 제작 과정을 완전히 새로운 차원으로 끌어올렸다고 자신 있게 말씀드릴 수 있어요. 이제 앱을 사용해 보는 과정을 함께 살펴보시죠.\n간편한 웹사이트 기획안 생성\n메인 화면에서 웹사이트 주제, 타겟 고객, 핵심 목표만 입력하면, AI가 이 정보를 바탕으로 랜딩페이지 기획안을 생성합니다. 만약 주제를 어떤 걸로 해야 할지 고민된다면, 우측 상단의 '주제 예시 선택' 버튼을 눌러보세요. 개인 홈페이지, 포트폴리오, 회사 홍보 페이지 등 자주 사용되는 20가지 유형이 미리 준비되어 있습니다.\n예를 들어, 저는 '이력서/경력소개'를 선택하고 '20년 경력 공인중개사 박동산'이라고 입력해 보았습니다. 타겟 고객이나 핵심 목표 설정도 귀찮다면, 주제 입력칸 아래 '타겟과 목표 자동 완성' 버튼을 누르세요. AI가 주제를 분석해서 가장 적절한 타겟과 목표를 자동으로 채워줍니다. 물론, 이 내용은 언제든 자신의 상황에 맞게 수정할 수 있습니다.\n모든 입력이 완료되면 '기획안 생성 시작' 버튼만 누르면 됩니다. 잠시만 기다리면 전문가가 작성한 듯한 기획안이 순식간에 나옵니다! 젬 지침에서 구현했던 브랜드 아이덴티티, 전체 구조 전략, 메인 및 서브페이지 기획, 심지어 폴더 구조와 기타 가이드까지 랜딩페이지 기획안의 모든 것이 생성되는 것을 볼 수 있었어요. 정말 놀라웠습니다.\n기획안 기반 웹사이트 제작 및 프로토타입 확인\n생성된 기획안 내용을 복사하여 AI 스튜디오 빌드에 붙여넣기만 하면, AI가 이 기획안을 바탕으로 웹사이트를 만들어줍니다. 동시에, 'AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트' 앱 자체에서도 프로토타입을 미리 볼 수 있는 기능을 제공합니다. 기획안 생성 후 우측 상단의 'PROTO TYPE 만들기'를 클릭하면 잠시 후 프로토타입이 완성되죠.\n이 HTML 파일은 간단한 테스트나 클라이언트 시안 확인용으로 정말 유용합니다. 다운로드한 HTML 파일을 더블클릭만 해도 브라우저에서 바로 열리기 때문에, 시안을 빠르게 확인할 수 있어 효율적이죠. AI 스튜디오 빌드에서 최종 완성된 랜딩페이지를 확인하면, 20년 경력 공인중개사의 아이덴티티가 잘 반영된 브랜드 페이지가 생성되어 있을 겁니다. 사용자는 이제 이 기본 틀에 자신에게 맞는 내용을 추가하거나 수정하며 현실화할 수 있습니다.\n  완성된 랜딩페이지, Vercel로 배포하기\nAI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트로 생성한 랜딩페이지를 세상에 공개하는 방법은 매우 간단합니다. Vercel을 활용하면 되는데, 그 방법을 다시 한번 자세히 알려드릴게요.\n\n\n\nGitHub 저장소 생성: 먼저 '깃허브 저장' 버튼을 클릭하고, 사이트명과 설명을 입력한 후 '공개'로 변경합니다. 그리고 하단의 'Create Git Repo' 버튼을 클릭하면 잠시 후 업로드 파일 목록이 보이고, 그 아래 'Change' 버튼을 클릭하면 GitHub에 업로드가 완료됩니다.\nVercel로 Import: 이제 Vercel로 이동하여 우측의 'Add New' > 'Project'를 클릭합니다. 저장소 목록에서 방금 GitHub에 업로드한 프로젝트 옆의 'Import' 버튼을 클릭한 후, 화면이 바뀌면 'Deploy'를 클릭합니다.\n배포 완료 및 공개 설정: 잠시 기다리면 배포가 완료되고, 대시보드 화면에 배포된 주소가 나타납니다. 이 사이트를 공개하려면 대시보드 위 메뉴의 'Settings'에서 'Deployment Protection' 탭을 선택하고 'Vercel Authentication'에 있는 슬라이드 스위치를 '비활성화'해야 합니다.\n이 과정을 거치면 기본적인 웹사이트가 완성되어 누구나 접근할 수 있게 됩니다. 정말 간단하죠? 이전에는 상상하기 어려웠던 전문가급 웹사이트 배포가 이제는 몇 번의 클릭만으로 가능해진 셈입니다.\n[ AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트로 만들어 배포된 페이지 예시]\nhttps://visual-impact-portfolio.vercel.app/\nhttps://park-dong-san-real-estate-portfolio.vercel.app/\nhttps://insight-flow-zeta.vercel.app/\nhttps://cheonhataepyeong-super.vercel.app/\nhttps://career-momentum.vercel.app/\nhttps://creator-profile-card.vercel.app/\nhttps://digital-goods-store.vercel.app/\nhttps://kim-sang-dam-portfolio.vercel.app/\n ️ 이미지 관리: 시각적 매력을 더하는 마무리\n생성된 기획안에는 이미지 링크가 loremflickr로 되어있는 경우가 있습니다. 이는 임시 플레이스홀더 이미지인데요, 사이트 서비스 자체는 무료이고 무료 이미지가 많지만, 실제 배포를 위해서는 저작권 문제가 없는 무료 이미지나 자신만의 이미지로 교체하는 것이 중요합니다. 이 점은 꼭 주의하셔야 합니다.\n  팁: '이 페이지에 이미지의 위치와 이미지를 교체하기 위해 적합한 이미지 생성 프롬프트를 알려줘. 앱 수정이 아니야. 응답만 해.'라고 입력하면, AI가 해당 사이트에 포함된 모든 이미지와 대체할 이미지의 생성 프롬프트를 상세하게 보여줍니다. 여기서 AI로 생성한 이미지나 보유 중인 이미지를 클라우드 등에 공유한 후, 이미지 주소와 함께 '메인 프로필 이미지를 이 주소로 변경해달라'고 요청하면 됩니다.\n✨ 이제 당신도 전문가급 웹사이트 오너!\n지금까지 'AI 랜딩페이지 아키텍트'를 활용하여 코딩 지식 없이도 전문가 수준의 웹사이트를 기획하고, 제작하고, 배포하는 모든 과정을 살펴보았습니다. 솔직히 저도 처음에는 이렇게까지 쉽고 빠르게 구현될 줄 몰랐습니다. 물론, 코딩 지식이 있다면 더 세밀하게 커스터마이징하고 자신만의 개성을 더할 수 있겠지만, 없어도 충분히 훌륭한 결과물을 만들 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 매력이라고 생각해요.\n2025년, AI 기술은 정말 우리 삶의 많은 부분을 변화시키고 있습니다. 특히 웹 개발 분야에서는 비전문가도 창작자가 될 수 있는 강력한 도구를 제공하고 있죠. 이제 복잡한 개발 과정에 발목 잡히지 말고, 여러분의 아이디어를 마음껏 펼쳐보세요.

VC들이 회사에 해를 끼치고, 회사를 망가뜨리지만 않으면 이들은 좋은 VC다.”라고 말할 정도로 회사에 피해를 주고 회사의 부채가 되는 VC들이 너무 많다. 나는 스트롱이 그 어떤 상황에서도 창업가의 편에 서서 이들의 든든한 지원군이 되는 VC가 될 수 있다는 확신이 있었다.\n두 번째는, 똑똑하지 않은 VC가 될 수 있다는 확신이 있었다. 이건 또 무슨 개소리인가 의아해하는 분들을 위해 잠깐 설명하면,,,많은 분들이 우리가 첨단 사업에 투자하고, 창업가에게 온갖 어려운 질문을 많이 하는 걸 보고 VC들이 IQ가 높고 똑똑한 사람들이라고 생각하는데, 솔직히 내가 아는 대부분의 VC는 – 이건 나도 포함 – 그렇게 똑똑하지 않다. 아니, 오히려 그 반대이다. 내가 아는 많은 VC는 실제로는 멍청한데, 대부분 엄청 똑똑한 척한다. 지금도 그렇지만, 13년 전에도 비슷했다. 근데 당시 내 생각은 VC는 별로 똑똑하지 않아도 되지만, 이들이 투자하는 창업가들은 반드시 똑똑해야 한다는 것이었다. 특히 우리 같은 초기 VC의 가장 큰 능력은 똑똑한 창업가들을 다른 사람들보다 먼저 알아보고, 이 창업가가 다른 VC가 아닌 내 돈을 받게 설득할 수 있는 것이다. 그리고 나는 이건 자신 있었다.\n스트롱을 시작할 때, 나는 돈도 없었고, 네트워크도 없었고, VC라는 업에 대한 이해도도 한참 떨어졌었지만, 위에서 말 한 두 가지의 기본 자격에 대해서는 그 누구보다 확신이 있었다. 결국 나의 가장 소중한 고객은 창업가이니 무슨 일이 있어도 이들을 존중하고 이들의 편에 서는 것, 그리고 나는 멍청해도 상관없으니까, 자만심과 자존심 다 필요 없고 그냥 똑똑한 창업가를 먼저 알아보고 이들에게 먼저 투자하는 것. 우리가 시작할 땐 이것밖에 없었다. 그리고 13년이 지난 지금도 우리의 이 믿음과 확신은 변치 않고 잘 지켜지고 있다고 나는 생각한다.\nVC는 똑똑하지 않아도 된다는 스트롱의 믿음에 대해 조금 더 이야기해 보고 싶다. 만약에 어떤 VC가 창업가와 미팅하고 있는데, 그 회의실에서 그가 가장 똑똑한 사람이라면, 또는 가장 똑똑하다고 생각하고 자만한다면, 그는 방을 잘 못 찾아온 것이다. 왜냐하면 이런 경우, 투자 검토를 하기 위해 도움이 되는 정보를 얻을 수 없기 때문이다. 너무 똑똑한 척하면서 창업가가 말하는 모든 것에 대해서 반박하는 VC들 앞에서는 대부분의 창업가가 주눅이 들고, 짜증 나서 이들과 제대도 된 대화를 할 수 없기 때문이다. \n오히려 노련한 VC들은 절대로 회의실에서 가장 똑똑한 사람이 되려고 하지 않는다. 위에서 말한 대로 이런 분위기가 조성되면 창업가들이 자신의 마음을 열지 않고, 그러면 투자자들이 정말로 알고 싶어하는 것을 이들이 알려 주지 않기 때문이다. 그렇게 창업가들보다 본인들이 똑똑하고, 모든 것에 대해서 본인들이 더 잘 안다고 생각하면, 직접 사업을 해보면 된다. 물론, 그럴 용기는 없을 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "2주 전에 잠깐 동경에 갔었는데, 과거부터 친분이 있던 일본 VC들과 다양한 이야기를 했다. 자연스럽게 한국과 일본의 스타트업 생태계 이야기를 특히 많이 했는데, 한국에 집중적으로 투자하는 나 같은 VC는 당연히 일본 시장보단 한국 스타트업 시장이 더 좋다고 믿지만, 내가 만난 일본 VC들도 대부분 한국의 벤처생태계를 부러워하는 느낌을 강하게 받았다. 어떤 일본 VC는 대놓고 나에게 한국 벤처생태계를 볼 때마다 너무나 부럽고, 일본도 한국 시장과 창업가들로부터 A부터 Z까지 모든 걸 적극적으로 배워야 한다고 주장했다.\n일본의 상장 시장의 크기는 한국의 3.5배 정도가 된다. 상당히 크고, 난 한국이 조만간 일본의 상장 시장 규모를 뛰어넘을 것이라고 확신하지만 현재의 이 규모는 상당히 부럽다. 그런데 내가 만난 일본 VC들은 오히려 한국의 역동적이고 큰 IPO 시장이 부럽다고 이야기했다. 무슨 말인지 더 구체적으로 물어보니, 일본의 상장 시장은 크지만, 자세히 보면 tech IPO는 질보단 양으로 만들어지고 있다는 게 이들의 답변이다. 한국 창업가들은 꿈과 야망이 상대적으로 커서 항상 아주 큰 IPO를 꿈꾸면서 사업을 하는데 – 물론, 그렇다고 IPO를 다 하는 것도 아니고, 해도 큰 IPO가 되는 건 아니지만 – 일본 창업가들은 사업하다가 어느 시점에 그냥 작은 IPO를 하는 게 요샌 유행같이 번지고 있다고 했다. 한 1,000억 정도의 IPO를 하면 창업가들은 그래도 잘 먹고 잘살 수 있고, 일본에서 이런 작은 IPO를 하는 게 상대적으로 쉽기 때문에 너도나도 적당한 규모로 사업을 키우고 IPO를 한다고 들었다. 창업가들은 돈을 벌어서 좋지만, 이 회사에 투자한 VC는 큰 재미를 못 보고, 계속 창업가들의 꿈과 야망이 이렇게 줄어들면 일본 스타트업 생태계는 큰 성장을 할 수 없다는 우려를 대화 내내 표시했다. 정확하게 “작은 IPO가 하나씩 될 때마다 일본 창업가들의 야망도 하나씩 줄어드는 것 같다.”라는 말을 했는데, 곰곰이 생각해 보면 일리가 있는 말 같다.\n그리고 일본 VC들로부터 내가 반복적으로 들었던 주제이자, 이들이 한국에 대해서 가장 부러워하는 게 한국인들의 “소비자 DNA(Consumer DNA)”였다. 한국 시장엔 소비자 DNA가 매우 강하게 자리 잡고 있는데, 이는 우리가 네이버, 쿠팡, 카카오, 토스, 당근, 배달의 민족 등과 같은 좋은 자체 B2C 유니콘을 끊임없이 만들고 제품화할 수 있는 이유다. 그리고 계속 이렇게 좋은 소비자 제품들이 시장에 출시되면, 한국인 특유의 경쟁심과 질투가 발동하면서 계속 더 좋은 기능, 더 좋은 UI/UX, 더 좋은 가격의 경쟁 제품들이 나오면서 “양이 질을 만드는” 효과가 극대화된다.\n일본은 이 소비자 DNA가 점점 더 사라져서 이젠 거의 없다는 이야기를 들었다. 일본 창업가들은 대부분 B2B에만 집중하기 때문에 일본을 대표하는 일본의 B2C 제품이 한국과 같이 많지도 않고 다양하지도 않다. 하지만, 인구도 많고 시장이 크기 때문에 일본의 소비자 시장은 외국 회사들의 놀이터가 됐다. 검색은 구글, 동영상은 유튜브, 지도는 구글맵스, 이커머스는 아마존, 택시 호출은 우버 등, 일본을 지배하고 있는 대부분의 B2C 제품은 외산 제품들이다. 그러면서 내가 들었던 말은 일본은 전 세계에서 외국 B2C 소프트웨어 회사들이 가장 쉽게 진출할 수 있는, 가장 큰 시장이 될 것이고됐고, 이들은 일본의 소비자 DNA가 완전히 사라지는 것에 대한 걱정과 아쉬움을 많이 표시했다.\n그리고 한국은 여기서 멈추지 않고 계속 진화하고 발전하고 있다. 우리만의 소비자 DNA를 기반으로 케이팝, 케이푸드, 케이뷰티, 케이콘텐츠와 같은 새로운 무형의 소비자 DNA가 만들어지고 있고, 이 무형의 한국의 문화가 현재 일본 시장을 완전히 쓰나미같이 덮치고 있다. 실은 일본도 한 때는 다른 나라의 문화에 큰 영향을 미쳤는데, 지금은 이게 다 죽었고, 오히려 한국 문화가 과거 일본 문화보다 더 커지고 있는데, 이게 모두 다 일본의 소비자 DNA의 소멸로 인한 아주 좋지 않은 결과라는 결론을 이분은 내렸다.\n물론, 한두 명의 일본 VC가 일본과 한국의 시장을 아주 정확하게 파악하는 것도 아니고, 시장 현황을 일반화할 수도 없지만, 10년 넘게 일본에서 투자하고 있는 VC들에게 이날 내가 들었던 내용만을 기반으로 결론을 내려보면, B2C 분야에서는 한국 창업가들이 일본 시장을 접수할 수 있다는 것이다. 우리가 잘하는 B2C로 시작하지만, 남에게 지는 걸 배 아파하는 한국인 특유의 경쟁심과 질투심으로 결국엔 B2B 사업도 일본 시장에서 더 잘할 수 있을거라 믿는다. 정말로 더 많은 한국 창업가들이 일본 시장에 진출해서 거대한 사업을 만들 수 있길 바란다.\n마지막으로,,,내 친구이자 VC인 일본 투자자가 한국 시장이 부럽다고 하는 가장 큰 이유는 결국엔 우리의 창업가들이다. 한 골 먹으면 두 골을 넣어야지 직성이 풀리는 우리 특유의 성깔?, 절대로 죽지 않고 생존하는 바퀴벌레력, 이 모든 게 한국의 강점이라고 생각한다. 내가 전에 여러 번 포스팅 했지만, 이 강점을 우린 계속 살려야 하고, 이 강점을 살리기 위해서는 더 치열하게, 그리고 열심히 일해야 한다.",

모임 준비로 설레는 분들이 많으시죠. 하지만 그보다 먼저 챙겨야 할 것이 있어요. 바로 연말정산 준비입니다. 11월, 12월은 절세 준비를 할 수 있는 마지막 기회입니다. 특히 요즘처럼 금리는 낮고 투자 시장이 불안할 때는 세액공제만큼 확실한 수익도 없습니다. 예금금리가 2%대에 머무는 시대에 세액공제를 통해 확정 수익을 얻을 수 있는 기회는 흔치 않으니까요.\n연말정산의 핵심은 단연코 연금계좌입니다. 연금계좌를 활용한 세액공제는 단순한 절세를 넘어 안정적인 자산 축적의 출발점이 되어 줘요. 세액공제를 통해 확보한 환급금을 연금으로 재투자하면 장기 복리 효과도 극대화할 수 있습니다.\n그러므로 올해는 꼭 대표적인 연금계좌인 연금저축펀드와 개인형 퇴직연금(IRP)을 적극적으로 활용해 손에 쥘 수 있는 절세 효과, 그리고 노후 준비를 한 번에 챙겨봅시다.\n• 연금저축펀드: 소득·나이 제한 없이 누구나 은행·증권사에서 가입 가능합니다. 편의상 연저펀 또는 연금저축이라고 부릅니다.\n• 개인형 퇴직연금(IRP): 근로소득자·자영업자 등 소득이 있는 사람만 가입 가능합니다. 은행·증권사·보험사에서 가입할 수 있으며 한 금융사당 1개 계좌만 개설할 수 있습니다.\n정부는 왜 연금을 넣으면 세금을 깎아줄까?\n솔직히 당장 먹고사느라 바쁜 우리가 훗날을 대비하는 연금까지 신경 쓰기란 쉽지 않습니다. 특히 100세 시대에는 30-40년이나 경제활동을 하는 것도 버거운데, 동시에 은퇴 후 노후에 쓸 재원까지 미리 계획해서 투자를 해둬야 한다니요. 대부분은 연금 관리가 어려우니까 슬며시 뒷단으로 미뤄놓기 일쑤입니다.\n그래서 정부는 부담을 덜어주기 위해 강력한 당근, 즉 세제 혜택을 제공합니다. 세제 혜택이 있으면 국민들이 보다 적극적으로 연금에 관심을 가지고 스스로 준비하게 되기 때문입니다. 정부의 궁극적인 목표는 국민들의 노후 생활에서 국민연금에 대한 의존도를 점차 낮추고, 각자 주도적으로 금융자산을 쌓아가는 문화를 만드는 데 있습니다. 또한 부동산 시장으로 자금이 과도하게 몰리는 현상을 억제하고, 대신 금융시장으로 자금을 유도하여 기업의 성장을 뒷받침하며, 궁극적으로 일자리 창출과 경제 활성화로 이어지는 선순환 구조를 만들려는 의도도 담겨 있습니다.\n결국 연금 세제 혜택은 단순히 개인의 안정적인 노후 준비를 넘어, 국가 전체의 장기적인 재정 안정과 금융시장의 건전한 발전, 나아가 실물 경제의 활력을 위한 정책이라고 할 수 있습니다.\n연금계좌의 세제 혜택에 대해 궁금한 5가지\nQ1. 연금계좌를 통해 얻는 구체적인 세제 혜택은 무엇인가요?\n→ 연금계좌에서 얻을 수 있는 세제 혜택은 연금을 납입할 때, 연금을 수령할 때 각각 적용됩니다.\n연금을 납입할 때\n• 매년 연말정산 시, 연금저축과 IRP에 납입한 금액에 대해 세액공제 혜택을 받을 수 있어요.\n• 연금계좌는 투자수익에 대한 세금 납부를 연금 수령 시까지 미루는 과세이연 혜택이 있어, 수익을 재투자하며 복리 효과를 키울 수 있어요.\n• 건강보험료 산정 시 사적 연금 납입액(연금저축, IRP 등)은 제외되어, 은퇴 후 건강보험료 부담도 줄일 수 있어요.\n• ISA(개인종합자산관리계좌) 해지 후 연금계좌로 이전 시 세액공제 한도가 최대 300만 원까지 추가됩니다. 이전시키는 금액의 10%, 최대 300만 원까지 절세 효과를 더 얻을 수 있어요.\n연금을 수령할 때\n연금 수령 시 최대 1,500만 원까지 연금소득세율(3.3~5.5%) 적용 등 다양한 혜택을 누릴 수 있어요. 단,  연금수령액이 연 1,500만 원을 초과하는 경우에는 연금수령 전액을 다른 소득과 합산해 종합과세(6.6%~49.5%)하거나, 분리과세(16.5%)하는 방법 중 본인에게 유리한 방식을 선택해야 합니다. 그러므로 가급적 연1,500만 원 이하로 연금수령액을 맞추는 게 좋습니다.\nQ2. 연금을 납입하고 돌려받는 세금을 왜 ‘확정 수익’이라고 부르나요?\n→  연금저축의 세액공제 한도는 연간 600만 원, IRP는 연간 900만 원이지만, 두 계좌를 합쳐 최대 900만 원까지 세액공제 대상이 됩니다. 이 세액공제 한도까지 채워서 납입하면 연말정산 때 118만-148만 5천 원을 현금 환급받을 수 있는데, 이는 연 13~16% 수준의 확정 수익률과 동일한 효과라고 할 수 있어요. 저금리 시대에 이만한 수익률을 찾기 쉽지 않기에 반드시 챙겨야 할 혜택입니다. 내년 초에 연말정산 환급금이 ‘13월의 보너스’처럼 들어오니, 환급된 금액을 재투자해 복리 효과를 누려도 좋아요.\nQ3. 얼마나 환급받을 수 있나요?\n→ 연금을 세액공제 최대 한도까지 납입한다고 가정해 보겠습니다. 세액 공제율은 총급여 5,500만 원 이하라면 16.5%, 초과라면 13.2%가 적용됩니다. 따라서 근로자가 연금 저축과 IRP에 각각 600만 원, 300만 원 또는 IRP에 900만 원을 채운다면 총급여 5,500만 원 이하 근로자는 최대 148만 5,000원, 초과자는 118만 8,000원을 환급받을 수 있습니다.\n단, 세액공제 한도를 넘어서 납입한 금액에는 추가 세제 혜택이 적용되지 않으니 자신의 예상 급여와 세액공제율을 미리 확인하고 효율적으로 계좌를 활용하는 것이 중요합니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✱참고: 1인당 연간 연금계좌 납입 한도는 총 1,800만 원입니다. 이 중 세액공제 한도가 최대 900만 원인 것입니다.\nQ4. 연금저축펀드와 IRP 중 어떤 게 더 유리할까요?\n→ 두 계좌 모두 세액공제 혜택이 있지만, 운용의 유연성과 제약 조건에 차이가 있습니다. 연금저축펀드는 주식형 ETF나 펀드에 100% 투자 가능하고, 중도 해지가 상대적으로 자유로운 편입니다. 누구나 가입 가능하며, 상대적으로 연금계좌를 유연하게 운용하고 싶은 분들에게 적합합니다.\n반면, IRP는 납입해둔 전체 자산의 최소 30% 이상을 안전자산(예금, 채권 등)으로 반드시 포함해야 하며, 중도 해지는 거의 불가능합니다. 가입 대상이 근로소득자 및 자영업자로 제한되며, 안정성과 절세 효과를 중시하는 투자자에게 상대적으로 더 적합합니다.\nQ5. 한쪽을 선택하는 게 좋을까요?\n→ 가장 효과적인 방법은 두 계좌를 모두 개설해 장기적으로 꾸준히 납입하며, 연금저축의 투자 유연성과 IRP의 절세 및 안정성이라는 장점을 함께 활용하는 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 장기 복리의 효과가 극대화됩니다.\n• 투자 유연성이 더 중요하다면 → 연금저축\n• 절세 + 안정성이 더 중요하다면 → IRP\n• 유연성과 안정성을 모두 잡아 장기 복리 효과를 극대화하려면 → 두 계좌를 병행해 꾸준히 납입하는 것이 가장 효율적\n내 금융생활에 연금계좌 잘 활용하는 법\nAction1: 연금계좌로 자동이체하기\n연금계좌에도 꾸준히 납입하는 것이 중요합니다. 세액공제 혜택은 연말정산 시 한 번 적용되지만, 납입액이 ETF, TDF 등으로 굴려져야 한다는 것을 고려하면 가격 변동에 따른 코스트 애버리징(Cost Averaging) 효과를 누리기 위해 시간 간격을 두고 정기적으로 적립하는 방식이 훨씬 유리합니다. 그래서 연말에 몰아서 납입하는 것도 방법이지만, 매달 일정 금액을 자동이체로 납입하는 루틴을 만드는 것이 더 효과적이에요.\n예를 들어, 월 75만 원씩 12개월 동안 자동이체하면 연간 세액공제 한도인 900만 원을 자연스럽게 채울 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 연말에 급히 목돈을 마련할 필요가 없고, 시장 변동에 따른 투자 타이밍을 재는 스트레스도 줄어듭니다.\nAction2: 연금계좌 포트폴리오 만들기\n연금계좌는 그냥 납입만 하면 끝나는 저축이 아닙니다. 본인이 스스로 투자 상품을 정하고 꾸준히 관리해야 하는 투자계좌입니다. 그렇기 때문에 ETF나 펀드로 운용하여 장기 복리 효과를 크게 누릴 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 예를 들어 미국 S&P500과 나스닥, 그리고 KOSPI ETF를 50%, 채권 ETF 35%, 금현물 ETF 15% 등으로 자신만의 포트폴리오를 구성하여 장기적으로 리밸런싱(rebalancing)✱하며 운용하시면 좋습니다.\n✱시간이 지나면서 변동된 자산 비중을 원래 계획한 목표 비중으로 다시 맞추는 과정.\n만약 투자 선택과 관리가 어렵다면, IRP의 경우 자산을 자동으로 운용해주는 ‘.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}디폴트옵션’을 이용할 수 있습니다. 이는 투자 성향에 맞춰 미리 설정한 옵션대로 연금계좌를 관리해주기 때문에 초보자도 쉽게 연금을 굴릴 수 있는 편리한 방법이랍니다.\n연금계좌는 한 번의 납입으로 끝나는 절세가 아니라 매달 쌓이는 복리의 힘으로 내 노후를 단단하게 지켜주는 자산입니다. 올해의 연금 납입은 내년의 세금 환급으로 돌아오고, 재투자와 복리 수익으로 세월이 흐른 뒤에는 노후자금으로 든든한 몫을 하게 될 것입니다. 그러니 연금은 단기적인 수익이 아닌 ‘시간을 이기는 구조’를 만들어준다고 할 수 있습니다. 이 모든 시작은 지금 내 연금계좌를 채우는 것에서 비롯된다는 사실을 잊지 마세요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호",

비주얼 아티스트가 함께했습니다. 2D, 3D, 실사, AI, 일러스트 등 서로 다른 장르의 작품들을 하나의 영상으로 엮어냈어요. 토스는 왜 갑자기 뮤직비디오를 만들었을까요? \n이번 뮤직비디오는 토스의 새로운 브랜드 이니셔티브인 ‘토스임팩트’의 시작을 알리는 브랜드 필름이기도 합니다. 토스임팩트는 사용자가 만나는 토스의 다양한 서비스가 품고 있는 맥락과

키비주얼과 슬로건. \n이 새로운 출발을 숫자나 성과가 아닌, 진심 어린 방식으로 전하고 싶었습니다. 조금 더 나은 세상에 대한 기대와 희망이 떠오르길 바랐어요. 그래서 뮤직비디오를 선택했습니다. 음악은 사람의 마음을 가장 빠르게 여는 언어니까요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}어떤 세상에 살고 싶나요?\n\n뮤직비디오 〈Spectrum〉은 ‘토스가 만들어갈 세상’을 이야기하지 않습니다. 대신 ‘당신이 꿈꾸는 세상은 어떤 모습인가요?’라는 질문을 던졌어요. 이 질문은 곧 K-Pop, 인디음악 분야에서 유망주로 주목받는 16팀의 비주얼 아티스트들에게 전해졌고, 그 순간부터 이야기는 훨씬 다채로워졌어요.\n누군가는 걱정과 갈등 없는 세상을, 누군가는 땀의 가치를 잃지 않는 세상을, 또 누군가는 작은 엉뚱함이 허용되는 세상을 떠올렸어요. 각자의 상상과 바람이 모여 뮤직비디오 〈Spectrum〉이 완성되었습니다. 토스는 누구나 자신이 바라는 꿈과 세상을 이야기할 수 있고, 그 작은 이야기들이 모여 세상이 조금씩 달라질 수 있다고 믿어요. 〈Spectrum〉은 그 믿음을 담은, ‘함께 상상하는 미래’의 기록이기도 합니다. 이렇게 모인 상상의 조각들은 토스가 앞으로 그려갈 세상의 밑그림이 되어줄 거예요.\n〈Spectrum〉을 함께한 16팀의 비주얼 아티스트와 아트워크를 소개합니다. \n\n\nThe Shape That Changes — 변하는 형태\n김연우

맞춰 스스로 변해가는 생명의 형태로 바라봤어요. 우리 역시 변화 속에 있습니다. 변화 앞에서 두렵기도 하고 조급해지기도 하지만, 결국 변화된 모습보다 변화의 과정 자체가 더 아름답다고 믿습니다.\n\nMusic Spreads All Around\n이희찬 @heechaney\n일러스트레이터·그래픽디자이너. 자신과 주변의 세계와의 관계에 관심을 두고, 이를

인정하며 다 함께 음악을 향유하는 세상을 꿈꿉니다. 작업은 와우산지키미

fools\nHwang Jaehwan @hwangjaehwane\n애니메이션 감독. 머릿속 창의적인 상상들이 흩어지지 않도록, 움직이는 이미지로 만들어 내는 일을 한다. 세상을 다채롭게 만들고, 히데오 코지마처럼 독창적인 세계관을 만들길 꿈꾼다.\n작가의 말\n움직이지 않아도 많은 것을 할 수 있는 시대에, '육체가 살아있다'는 감각을 잊지 않는 세상을 이야기 하고 싶었습니다. 편리함이 커질수록 우리는 몸을 덜 쓰게 되고, 그만큼 생각도 식어가는 것 같아요. 심장이 뛰고, 근육이 찢어지고, 뜨거운 땀이 흐르는 순간이야말로 인간을 인간답게 만든다고 믿습니다. 애니메이션을 통해 들끓는 생명력과 원초적 에너지를 보여드리고 싶었습니다.\n\nIn Between\n토이카 @9toika9\n서울을 기반으로 활동하는 작가 토이카는 ‘괴물’이라는 상징과 캐릭터를 통해 자아와 감정의 형상을 탐구한다. 디지털과 회화, 애니메이션을 넘나들며 존재가 드러나는 순간과 그 변형의 과정을 시각화한다.\n작가의 말\n‘어떤 세상에 살고 싶나요?’라는 질문은 잊고 살던 마음속 생각들을 다시 꺼내게 해주었습니다. 살아오며 저는 싫어하던 것을 결국 좋아하게 되고, 좋아하던 것을 결국 싫어하게 되는 경험을 반복해왔습니다. 어쩌면 제가 좋아하는 것이 실은 두려워하는 것이고, 제가 싫어하는 것이 실은 정말 사랑하는 것일지도 몰라요. 저의 세상은 그렇게 끊임없이 모순되고, 서로 닮아가며 변해간다는 걸 배우고 있습니다.\n그리고 그런 세상이 좋습니다. 그게 제가 원하던 세상입니다. 뮤직비디오 작업을 통해 경계가 흐려지고, 서로의 형태가 스며드는 세상을 표현하고자 했습니다.\n\n작은 것들의 맛 The Taste of Small Things\nDonkeysoo @donkeysoo\n뉴욕과 서울을 기반으로 활동하는 믹스미디어 애니메이터. 클레이 스톱모션을 중심으로 K-Pop 아티스트들과 뮤직비디오 협업을 진행하며, 뉴욕에서는 조각과 애니메이션 중심의 전시 활동을 이어오고 있다. 어린 시절의 공상과 노스탤지아에서 영감을 받아 다양한 재료와 기법으로 새로운 애니메이션 세계를 탐구한다.\n작가의 말\n요즘 들어 현실이 너무 또렷하고, 때로는 냉정하게 느껴질 때가 있습니다. 상상이 들어갈 틈이 없을 만큼 선명한 세상 속에서, 틈을 살짝 벌려 조금이라도 엉뚱함을 집어넣고 싶었습니다. 제가 가장 좋아하는 영화 <녹차의 맛> 속에는 예기치 않은 장소에서 이상한 포즈를 취하는 인물들이 등장합니다. 그들을 볼 때마다 묘한 해방감과 자유를 느껴왔습니다. 미묘하지만 확실히 이상한 그들이 허용되는 세상에 살고 싶다는 생각이 들었습니다. \n이번 작업은 오랫동안 시도해보고 싶었던 ‘현실 속 클레이 애니메이션’을 구현한 프로젝트입니다. 클레이의 말랑하고 유연한 특성을 살려, 자유롭게 몸을 움직이는 캐릭터들을 만들며 저 또한 함께 포즈를 취해보며 엉뚱함이 가진 에너지를 몸으로 느낄 수 있었습니다. 관객들이 제 작품을 보고 어린 시절로 잠깐 돌아간 것처럼, 자신만의 작은 ‘엉뚱의 틈’을 느꼈으면 좋겠습니다. 적어도 제 작품을 마주하는 순간만큼은 마음껏 유치해지고 이상해졌으면 좋겠어요.\n\n충돌않는 충돌\n황보나현 @hwangbonahyun\nAI 아티스트. 현실과 비현실 사이의 묘한 경계선 위에서 AI를 기반으로 여러 시각 실험을 이어간다.\n작가의 말\n‘사람은 하나의 우주이고, 사람과 사람이 만나는 것은 서로 다른 거대한 우주가 만나는 일’, 그리고 ‘대혐오의 시대’. 이 두 문장에서 작업을 시작했습니다. 두 개의 큰 우주가 만나도 ‘혐오’로 가득 차지 않는 세상이 되길, 그런 비통한 단어에서 벗어난 세상이 다시 찾아오길 바라는 마음으로요. 다른 빛이 만나 새로운 색을 만들 듯, 다른 존재들이 충돌하지 않고 스며드는 순간을 꿈꿉니다. .그곳엔 경계도, 혐오도 없을 거예요.\n\nEndless Bloom\nANREAL지현 @an_realphoto\nAI와 상상을 도구 삼아 이미지 너머의 가능성을 실험한다. 예측보다는 가능성, 완성보다는 흐름을 믿으며 질문을 품고 자신만의

자유롭게 유영합니다. 그 여정 속에서 마주하는 비현실적인 자연은 모험과 우연, 환상과 발견이 어우러진 다채로운 확장의 세계를 상징합니다.\n우리가 바라보는 세상은 끊임없이 변화하지만, 우리 안의 ‘감각’은 언제나 그 자리에서 우리를 새로운 세계로 이끕니다. 잠시 멈춰 각자의 감각을 통해 세상을 바라보세요.\n\n몰입\n박지현

찾는 일과도 같습니다. 몰입은 미래를 기대하게 만드는 힘이 있습니다. 형태를 불문하고, 누구에게나 눈을 반짝이게 만드는 것들이 있다고 생각합니다. 다양한 몰입을 경험하고 공유하는 세상을 꿈꿉니다.\n\nWE NEED SOME LOVE\n러프초이 @rough_choi\n사진과 영상을 오가며 음악 패션 분야에서 작업을 이어오고 있다. 최근에는 힙노시스 테라피(HYPNOSIS THERAPY)의 〈UMJIGYEO! (MOVE!)〉 뮤직비디오를 연출했다.\n작가의 말\n수많은 불빛들을 모아 문장을 만들었습니다. 작은 불빛 하나하나는 도시에 살아가는 한 사람을 의미합니다. 각자의 자리에서 빛나던 불빛을 모아 하나의 메시지를 전하고자 했습니다. 직접 제작한 보케 필터를 통해 빛을 단어 형태로 담아 낼수 있었습니다. 작은 불빛들이 모여 도시를 밝히지만, 정작 그 속에 있는 우리는 서로를 비추지 않고 있는 것 같습니다. 우리가 더 사랑하고 서로를 비출 수 있는 세상에 살고 싶습니다.\n\n놀이터\n키숄 @kitschbaba\n갖고 싶은 장면들만을 모아 멋대로 바꾸고 연결하기를 즐기는 시각 작업자. 자신만의 향수를 감각하면서도 가보지 않은 길들에 호기심을 더하는 태도로 살아간다. 그 과정에서 포착하는 이미지들을 통해 자신이 속한 현실을 가장 가까우면서도 가장 멀게 그려낸다.\n작가의 말\n끌림을 거부하지 않고, 그 감정을 포착하고 때로는 불안정하더라도 연결하고 싶었어요. 진짜의 시간들과 조형물들이 제 감각으로 담기고 편집된 후, 다른 작가들의 작업과 함께 연결된다면 이질적으로 보이더라도 결국은 하나로 이어질 수 있다고 믿었습니다. 그 믿음 속에서, 불안함과 기대를 함께 안고 작업했습니다. 함께 올라탄 이 세상을 놀이터라 생각하고 즐기고 싶어요. 고통스러운 부분들도 더 큰 아름다움 안에 속한다고 믿는 요즘입니다.\n\nSingularity\nmareykrap @mareykrap\n패션디자인과 섬유미술을 전공했지만 2018년부터는 줄곧 그림을 그린다. 현실에 없는 장면을 그리며, 현실을 그릴 때에도 비틀어 비현실적으로 전환한다. 세계를 그린다는 일은 보이지 않던 것을 존재하게 만드는 일이며, 작가의 삶을 다루는 태도와도 닮아 있다. 지금은 K-pop 뮤직비디오와 그림 속에 그 세계가 놓여 있지만, 다른 매체로도 세계를 확장해갈 계획이다.\n작가의 말\n모두가 같은 모양과 자세로 멈춰 있는 세상. 아무도 움직이지 않고, 무채색으로 생명이 꺼져있습니다. 정지 속에서 단 하나의 존재가 미세하게 떨리자, 우주의 푸른 기운이 깃들고 자아가 깨어납니다. 그 푸름은 전염처럼 번져 잊힌 꿈들을 깨우고 세상은 다시 돌기 시작합니다. 개성의 각성은 세상에 생명을 불어넣습니다. 모든 존재가 각자 다른 푸른빛으로 물듭니다. 존재들은 제각기 다른 속도로 떠오르고, 각자의 우주로 확장된 그 흩어짐이 새로운 세상의 빅뱅이 됩니다.\n개성은 서로를 물들이지만, 복제되지는 않는 세상을 표현했습니다. 다른 빛으로 공존하며 번져나가 더 넓은 세상을 만드는 것을 꿈꿉니다.\n\n감각의 흐름 속 빛나는 찰나\n페이퍼 컴퍼니 @qaqer.comqany\n콜라주를 통해 서로 다른 이미지를 엮고, 협업과 실험으로 새로운 시각 경험을 만들어가는 비주얼 스튜디오. 음악, 브랜드, 영상 등 다양한 영역 속에서 유쾌한 감각으로 낯선 조합을 탐구하며, 이미지의 틈새에서 새로운 이야기를 찾아낸다.\n작가의 말\n이 작품은 각자의 취향과 취미, 저마다의 개성을 중심으로 펼쳐지는 작은 순간들을 시각적으로 담아냅니다. 아날로그 방식을 택한 이유는 행복과 낭만이 멀리 있지 않음을, 마음만 먹으면 큰 도움 없이도 손끝에서 시작될 수 있음을 보여주기 위함입니다. 손으로 직접 엮고 빚어내는 과정 속에서 느껴지는 따뜻함과 소소한 기쁨, 그리고 각자가 만들어내는 다채로운 감각의 흐름을 시각적으로 표현했습니다. 일상 속 가까운 곳에서 피어나는 작은 세계들을 마주하며, 여러분이 자신만의 감각과 순간을 떠올릴 수 있기를 바랍니다. Analog Never Die!\n\n나의 우주\nFOM FOM @fom__fom__\n3D 애니메이션과 일러스트레이션을 기반으로 활동한다. 뮤직비디오, 단편 애니메이션, 에디토리얼 프로젝트를 통해 꿈과 현실의 경계에 존재하는 이야기를 시각화한다. 낯설지만 익숙한 감정의 순간을 화면에 담아, 보는 이가 자신의 기억과 감정을 투영할 수 있는 세계를 만든다.\n작가의 말\n각자의 머릿속에는 자신만의 우주가 존재한다고 생각합니다. 이 작품은 ‘모자’를 머릿속의 상징으로 설정하고, 그 안에 각자의 이야기로 채워진 공간을 상상했습니다. 주인공이 모자를 벗는 순간, 그 안에서 또 다른 자신과 상상의 친구들이 나타나 별과 음표가 떠다니는 음악의 세계로 비상합니다. 이 장면은 현실과 상상의 경계가 스며드는 찰나를 포착하며, 내면의 감정이 빛과 소리로 피어나는 순간을 담고 있습니다.\n‘모자를 벗는 행위’는 자신의 내면을 열어 상상의 세계를 펼치는 용기의 표현이자, 마음속 우주가 현실로 이어지는 순간을 상징합니다. 우리 모두 잠시 현실을 벗어나 마음속에서 피어나는 빛과 음악을 따라가며, 자신의 세계를 즐겁게 마주하는 시간이 되었으면 합니다.\n\n손 안의 우주\n돌돌보이 @doldolboys\n3D 캐릭터 아티스트. 동시대 대중문화의 감각을 즉흥적 몽타주로 재구성한다.\n작가의 말\n각자의 세상을 품은 불안한 모습의 빛들이 소년을 향합니다. 그들은 저마다 고립된 세상 속 자신의 목소리만 낼 뿐이었습니다. 충돌하는 빛들은 소년의 손안에서 다양한 세상, 모든 것의 가능성을 느낍니다. 모든 빛들이 교차하고 스며들어 경계는 소멸하고, 세상은 조화와 평화가 깃든 하나의 순간으로 이어집니다. \n프리즘을 통과하며 펼쳐지는 색처럼, 다양한 삶이 만나 교차하고 공감하는 평화로운 세상이 펼쳐지길 바랍니다. 당신도 손안에 작은 우주를 품고 있다는 걸 기억하세요.\n\nClose-up\nEEHOSOO @eehosoo\n패션, 영상, 전시, 음악 등 다양한 분야에서 시각 기반의 아트워크와 영상 작업을 이어가고 있다. 최근에는 선미의 컴백 트레일러를 제작하며 독창적인 영상 연출을 선보였다.\n작가의 말\n랜덤한 상황에서 만들어지는 우연성에 요새 빠져있어서 AI로 작업을 했어요. 미래를 그리기보다, 당장 내 눈앞에 존재할 수 있는 유토피아를 보여주고 싶었어요. 완벽한 소통과 관계를 이룰 수 있는 세상에 살길 꿈꿉니다.\n\n악수 Handshake\n조경욱 @kyeongwookjo\n에스파, NCT 127의 초기 비주얼 작업을 비롯해 여러 아티스트들의 뮤직비디오 애니메이션을 그려왔다. 이미지와 움직임을 통해 감정을 시각화하는 작업을 즐기며, 감각과 리듬으로 이야기를 전한다.\n작가의 말\n최근 들어 필요에 의해 이루어지는 관계들에 회의감을 느꼈습니다. 그 감정과 경험을 ‘악수’라는 행위로 은유했습니다. 찰나의 마주침 같은 인사가 아닌, 서로의 심장을 내어주는 진심 어린 교감과 공감, 그리고 사랑 같은 것들이 결국 세상을 더 나은 방향으로 이끈다고 생각했습니다. 작품은 전쟁과 사고, 재난이 뒤섞인 어수선한 세상에서 시작해 다양한 사람들이 함께 살아가는 평화로운 세계로 향합니다. 그 변화를 짧지만 강렬한 이미지로 표현하고자 했습니다.\n여러 아티스트와 함께 콜라보할 기회는 흔치 않은데, 즐겁고 의미 있는 시간이었습니다. 이 영상을 보신 분들이 잠시라도 좋은 기분을 느끼신다면 저도 행복할 것 같습니다. 따뜻하고 반짝이는 연말 보내시길 바랍니다.",
