        "content:encodedSnippet": "How does Meta empower its product teams to harness GenAI’s power responsibly? In this post, we delve into how Meta addresses the challenges of safeguarding data in the GenAI era by scaling its Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI), with a particular focus on Meta’s AI glasses as an example GenAI use case. \nWe’ll describe in detail the technology behind data lineage, explain how modern infrastructure supports privacy at scale, and discuss how these advances accelerate product innovation while keeping privacy at the core.\nAI glasses are only one of the latest examples of how generative AI (GenAI) has been driving a range of new product experiences across all our platforms at Meta.\nWhile GenAI enables new features like hyper-personalized recommendations and responsive real-time assistants, it is also reinforcing the importance of earning and maintaining user trust by maintaining and protecting user data.\nAs AI products like our AI glasses ingest, process, and generate increasingly rich data, they also introduce new opportunities for embedding privacy into those processes. Our vision to empower our product teams to responsibly harness the power of GenAI is a bold one: We scale our Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) as a foundational backbone of AI innovation.\nBy empowering product teams with lineage insights and automated privacy controls, we accelerate GenAI product innovation while upholding user trust and privacy as foundational principles.\n\nThe Key Privacy Challenges of GenAI\nWe’ve encountered three primary challenges to ensuring privacy for GenAI:\nTechnological evolution and explosive data growth: The emergence of GenAI has introduced novel data types and dramatically increased data volumes, presenting new complexities in data observability and management.\nShifting requirements landscape: Advancements in technology continually generate new privacy and compliance requirements. Our ability to remain competitive and innovative hinges on how swiftly we can adapt to these evolving demands.\nAccelerated innovation cycles: GenAI-powered features drive faster product development, necessitating infrastructure that can scale rapidly and enforce privacy controls automatically.\nMeta’s AI glasses integrate wearable technology with GenAI to deliver  real-time information, personalized assistance, and creative capabilities—all contextualized to the wearer’s surroundings.\nReal-time scene understanding: Meta’s AI glasses leverage advanced cameras and sensors to interpret your surroundings, enabling you to ask questions like, “What is that building?” or “Can you read this sign to me?” and receive instant, relevant answers. \nContextual overlays: GenAI models deliver dynamic overlays and summaries, offering guidance and information tailored to your current location or activity for a more personalized experience.\nNatural and intuitive interactions: Innovative input methods such as the Meta Neural Band and advanced output technologies, like those featured in the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, enable seamless and intuitive interactions and low-latency, full-duplex conversations that go beyond simple commands.\nForward-looking use cases like these highlight the intricate data flows enabled by GenAI: continuous sensor inputs, real-time processing both on-device and in the cloud, and a dynamic feedback loop to the user. They also speak to our key challenges and underscore the need for robust, adaptable systems that prioritize privacy as GenAI continues to transform our products and data ecosystem.\nAt Meta, we tackle these challenges with integrated privacy via a scalable infrastructure that is deeply embedded from the ground up during product development.\nFor example, Figure 1 outlines how we use our PAI technologies to track and protect user interactions with the Meta AI app that happen through our AI glasses.\nFigure 1: System context for AI glasses interactions with the Meta AI app.\nAn Overview of Meta’s Privacy-Aware Infrastructure\nMeta’s PAI sits at the heart of our privacy strategy. PAI is a suite of infrastructure services, APIs, and monitoring systems designed to integrate privacy into every aspect of product development. \nAddressing the challenges listed in the section above, it includes:\nEnhanced observability: Automated data detection through advanced scanning and tagging identifies relevant data at the point of ingestion. This is further strengthened by data-lineage tracking, which maintains a real-time map of data origins, propagation paths, and usage—providing comprehensive visibility into how data flows across systems.\nEfficient privacy controls: Policy-enforcement APIs to programmatically enforce privacy constraints at the data storage, processing, and access layers. Policy automation that embeds regional and global requirements into automated checks and workflow constraints.\nScalability: Supports thousands of microservices and product teams across Meta’s vast ecosystem.\nPAI empowers engineers to innovate while automatically ensuring policy adherence and safety. Figure 2 summarizes this lifecycle and highlights the Discover stage we focus on below.\nFigure 2: Key privacy workflows.\nA Deep Dive Into the “Discover” Stage of Our PAI\nOne of PAI’s most transformative technologies is our approach to data lineage at scale. Our data lineage system continuously tracks and maps data flows across the entire infrastructure. While we discussed the technical foundations in our prior blog post on how Meta discovers data flows via lineage at scale, here we’ll explore a new perspective — highlighting how we’ve adapted our lineage capabilities to meet the unique challenges of GenAI’s rapidly evolving environment.\nMeta’s vast scale and diverse ecosystem of systems present significant challenges for observing data lineage. Our lineage solution must operate across millions of data and code assets, spanning hundreds of platforms and a wide array of programming languages. \nLet’s take a look at how this works.\nCollect Cross-Stack Lineage for Interaction Data\nTo maintain the privacy requirements for the data under consideration — for example, for user-interaction data from the scenario above with our AI glasses — we need a complete map of its movement. This traceability is what cross-stack lineage provides, as illustrated in Figure 3:\n[A] Within web: We capture data flows as the interaction data enters Meta’s web servers and further downstream between web components with privacy probes, so we know exactly what is collected and how it’s processed.\n[B] Web -> logger -> warehouse: When the web processing persists data, lineage tracks the logger that writes to the data-warehouse tables. Then, when the data is batch-processed downstream, we parse logger configs, SQL queries, and processing logs to extract data lineage.\n[C] Web <> inference: For large language model (LLM) calls, we collect lineage signals at service/RPC boundaries; for example, which model checkpoints are invoked, what are the inputs, and what are the responses returned to the app.\n[D] Warehouse -> training: Finally, lineage links warehouse tables into training jobs and the checkpoints they produce. This boundary is where we can enforce and demonstrate privacy requirements regarding the purposes that are allowed.\nFigure 3: Cross-stack lineage.\nPAI collects these lineage signals crossing all stacks, including web probes, logger, batch-processing lineage, RPC lineage, and training manifests. Together they form an end-to-end graph for interaction data. Figure 4 shows this graph. With this visibility, we can reason about privacy in concrete terms: We know exactly which systems are involved and which ones aren’t. That clarity is what enables us to enforce data flow at boundaries and prove policy adherence.\nFigure 4: End-to-end lineage for AI-glasses interaction.\nBuilding Comprehensive Lineage Observability\nA sound lineage-observability system must catch all actual data flows or I/O operations comprehensively when data is processed. To achieve that we:\nCapture and link all read operations to the write operation: When we write a data asset, we ensure that we log all relevant write operations with the same correlation key as the one used for the read operation. We perform this logging for both SQL and non-SQL queries, as well as when I/O operations occur in a distributed manner.\nCreate a common privacy library to log data flow information: Our privacy library (PrivacyLib) is designed to initialize and propagate privacy policies, offer a generic abstraction for diverse operations (e.g. reads, writes, remote calls), and standardize extensions such as logging. Figure 5 illustrates how PrivacyLib is being used to link reads and writes across systems.\nPlace library integration points in all involved data systems at Meta: We have integrated the library into all relevant data systems, implemented it in various programming languages, and ensured comprehensive coverage of I/O operations.\nFigure 5: Building lineage observability via PrivacyLib.\nFrom Lineage to Proof for AI Glasses\n​​Data lineage tells us which systems process AI-glasses-interaction data. Based on that, we can protect the data in the following manner:\nWe use lineage to guide the placement of Policy Zones, protecting interaction data. \nWe start the training job for a model using a data asset in this zone only if all training-data assets are permitted for this purpose; otherwise, we remediate it.\nFinally, our verifiers watch these edges over time, so that any new or changed data-processing jobs are identified early during feature development.\nAs shown in Figure 6, this set of workflows is how we transform lineage into protection: place Policy Zones, block boundary crossings, and continuously prove it.\nFigure 6: From lineage to proof via Policy Zones.\nZooming out: Privacy-Safe Data Across the GenAI Lifecycle\nScaling privacy from early prototypes to global rollouts requires infrastructure that adapts across products, regions, and evolving AI capabilities. PAI’s data understanding, data flow lineage, and policy enforcement facilitate safe and conformant data flows. This infrastructure enables Meta to launch products such as ourAI glasses confidently at a global scale, providing users with rich, personalized experiences powered by GenAI, while ensuring transparent and verifiable privacy guarantees.\nKey Takeaways: How PAI Scales GenAI Privacy\nMeta’s approach to privacy is straightforward: scale the infrastructure, not just the rules. By embedding PAI technologies including data lineage into the stack, Meta empowers engineers to deliver the next wave of GenAI products safely, quickly, and globally. \nLightning-fast advancements from GenAI and its powered products bring new privacy and policy challenges that require rapid development of privacy-aware infrastructure.\nPrivacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) provides reusable workflows (Understand -> Discover -> Enforce -> Demonstrate) that scale privacy enforcement for GenAI products as well.\nScalable data lineage technology facilitates privacy controls by giving us auditable, real-time insight into every data flow.\nAutomatic guardrails and instant development feedback help product teams move faster and safer, with lower friction..\nAs GenAI Evolves, So Does Privacy\nScaling privacy for GenAI is an ongoing journey. As AI capabilities advance, so do the complexity and expectations around privacy protection. Meta’s PAI is evolving in step—integrating smarter lineage analysis and increasingly developer-friendly tools to meet these new demands.\nAs GenAI ushers in the next era of digital experiences, our focus on privacy remains strong. By scaling privacy infrastructure as a product enabler, not a barrier, Meta is laying the groundwork for responsible AI-product innovation.\nInterested in learning more?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the highlights and key takeaways from the recently released Django Developers Survey. Now in its fourth year, this annual collaboration between the Django Software Foundation and PyCharm tabulates responses from over 4,600 Django developers worldwide. If you work with Python and the web more broadly, there’s a lot to learn from what’s happening in the vibrant Django ecosystem.\nMy name is Will Vincent, and I’m a longtime contributor to the Django community as well as a Developer Advocate at PyCharm. Over the last six years, I’ve co-written the weekly Django News newsletter alongside Jeff Triplett and co-hosted the Django Chat podcast with Carlton Gibson; in both venues, we find a seemingly inexhaustible supply of topics, packages, and people to discuss.\nDjango is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year and is settling in quite nicely, thank you, to its mature status. Backward-breaking changes are exceedingly rare, even as new feature versions (5.2, 6.0, 6.1, etc.) are released every eight months, double-digit PRs are merged into core each week, and the global community has never been stronger.\nThis thriving ecosystem exists thanks to the ongoing work of Django’s maintainers, reviewers, and mentors. Each year, PyCharm joins forces with the Django Software Foundation to support that work through the Annual Django Fundraiser.\nUntil November 9, 2025, you can get 30% off PyCharm Professional, and JetBrains will donate all proceeds to the DSF – directly funding the people who make Django stronger with every release. Over the past nine years, the campaign has raised more than $330,000 for Django’s continued growth and stability.\nGet PyCharm Pro with 30 % Off & Support Django\n                                \nBuild with Django. Build its future.\nOne final point before we dive into the results: despite being used by millions of developers and some of the world’s largest companies, Django itself remains largely unaware of its real-world usage. By design, there is no analytics tracking on the official Django website and no concrete metric of downloads aside from the admittedly imperfect measure of PyPI Stats.\nThis survey has become one of, if not the, primary way for the community to understand current Django usage. In recent years, survey results led to the Redis cache backend receiving official support in Django 4.0. More recently, MongoDB saw solid usage numbers and prioritized releasing an official django-mongodb-backend package for the first time this year.\nIn short, this survey is essential and provides the best glimpse any of us have into the actual usage trends and future feature desires of the wider Django community.\nKey Django trends in 2025\nLet’s take a look at the notable and sometimes surprising trends in this year’s Django survey.\n\n\n\n\nHTMX + Alpine.js Are Ascendant\nReact and jQuery remain the two most popular JavaScript frameworks to use with Django, but momentum continues to build for HTMX and Alpine.js. These technologies favor a server-rendered template approach with interactivity sprinkled in.\nTwenty years ago, when Django was first released, single-page applications (SPAs) were rare. Most websites relied on a hypermedia approach of server-rendered templates; the introduction of jQuery in 2006 provided a way to sprinkle in JavaScript-powered interactivity without needing to become a JavaScript expert.\nFast forward ten years, and many web frameworks, including Django, were being used to power RESTful API backends consumed by dedicated JavaScript frontends, such as React, Angular, and Vue.\nBut since the Django Survey began in 2021, the pendulum has shifted back towards server-side templates. HTMX has grown from 5% in 2021 to 24%, while Alpine.js has grown from 3% to 14% usage. At the same time, React and jQuery have consistently declined from 37% in 2021 to 32% for React and 26% for jQuery. It is interesting to note that Vue, the third-most popular JavaScript framework, has also declined over this time period from 28% to 17%.\n\n\n\n\nThe forthcoming Django 6.0 release adds official support for template partials, further cementing the HTMX/Alpine.js combination as a viable alternative for developers. The release of this new feature also speaks to one of the strengths of the Django ecosystem, which is the thousands of third-party packages available. Some eventually make their way into core, as this one did, first starting as django-template-partials by Carlton Gibson and formally brought into core with the help of Farhan Ali Raza during his Google Summer of Code program this year.\nWhat does this all mean for Django? It speaks to Django’s maturity and continued evolution that it can support multiple frontend patterns in web development: API backends via django-rest-framework or django-ninja for developers who prefer a SPA architecture, and also server-rendered templates enhanced by HTMX, Alpine.js, and soon template partials. Django continues to iterate to meet the needs of modern web developers, while retaining the stability and security that make it so indispensable to millions of existing users.\nAI Usage is Growing\nA majority of respondents (79%) still rely on official documentation as their primary learning resource, followed by Stack Overflow (39%), and both AI tools and YouTube (38%). For AI tools, this is a remarkable rise considering the category didn’t even exist several years ago. It is also worth noting that blogs (33%) and books (22%) now trail well behind.\n\n\n\n\nFor Django development, 69% reported using ChatGPT, followed by 34% for GitHub Copilot, 15% for Anthropic Claude, and 9% for JetBrains AI Assistant. The most popular tasks for AI were autocomplete (56%), generating code (51%), and writing boilerplate code (44%). We will likely see even greater rates of adoption in this area in next year’s survey results.\nAnecdotally, many hallway conversations at DjangoCon Europe and DjangoCon US this year centered on AI tooling. The options available — chat, autocomplete, and agents — are all relatively new, and there is yet to be a community consensus on how to best utilize them for Django development, despite ongoing discussions around AI Agent Rules and related topics on the Django Forum.\nDjango Developers are Experienced\nIn marked contrast to the Python Survey released earlier this year, which showed exactly half (50%) of respondents had less than two years of professional experience, Django developers are a very experienced bunch: 30% of respondents reporting 11+ years of experience, followed by 26% for 6-10 years, and 21% for 3-5 years. That means that 77%–or 3 out of 4–Django developers have at least three years of professional coding experience.\n\n\n\n\nAn overwhelming majority of respondents (82%) use Django professionally, in addition to personal usage. Roughly half (51%) report using Django for backend APIs with Django REST Framework, while a full 80% perform full-stack development, no doubt enhanced by the growing server-rendered templating options.\nStrong Support for Type Hints\nPerhaps it should come as no surprise, given the relative experience of respondents to this survey, that there was overwhelming support for Type Hints: 63% reported already using type hints in their Django code, with another 17% planning to, resulting in a remarkable 80% overall rate.\n\n\n\n\nWhen asked if type hints should be added to Django core — an ongoing point of discussion on the Django Steering Council — 84% said yes, with 45% indicating a willingness to contribute themselves.\nDjango, like Python, has long strived to be both welcoming to newcomers while also providing the more advanced tools experienced programmers often prefer, such as type hints.\nPostgreSQL Paces the Field\nWhen it comes to favored database backend, it is no surprise that those with built-in support reign supreme, starting with PostgreSQL at 76%, followed by SQLite at 42%, MySQL at 27%, and MariaDB at 9%. These percentages have remained remarkably consistent over the past four years.\n\n\n\n\nOracle continues to enjoy relative growth in usage, climbing from 2% in 2021 and 2022 to 10% in 2023 and 9% in 2024. Newer entrants, such as MongoDB, also deserve attention: even without official support, it managed an 8% share in 2023, indicating the desire for NoSQL options powered by Django. This survey result was a key component in the Mongo team’s decision to invest in an official Django MongoDB backend, which was fully released this year.\nIt will be interesting to track database support in the coming years, given a resurgence in interest around using SQLite in production — not just for local development — as well as NoSQL options from MongoDB, and to monitor whether Oracle continues to maintain its usage share.\nPopular Third-Party Packages\nWhen asked for their top five favorite third-party Django packages, there was a very long tail of responses, reflecting both the depth and breadth of packages in the Django ecosystem.  Resources such as djangopackages.org, the awesome-django repo, and the new Django Ecosystem page highlight that Django’s secret sauce is its ecosystem of third-party apps and add-ons.\nNotably, Django REST Framework was the runaway favorite with 49% followed by `django-debug-toolbar` at 27%, `django-celery` at 26%, `django-cors-headers` at 19%, `django-filter` at 18%, and `django-allauth` at 18%. Many different packages received support after these top few, again speaking to the breadth of options available to Django developers.\nThe Latest Django Version Reigns Supreme\nAn overwhelming majority of respondents (75%) report being on the latest version of Django, which is impressive given the cadence of feature releases, which occur approximately every eight months. For example, Django 5.1 was released in August 2024, Django 5.2 in April 2025, and Django 6.0 will come out in December 2025.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the regular release schedule, Django takes great efforts to remain stable and has a well-established depreciation and removal policy; breaking changes are rare. \nIt is also worth noting that certain feature releases — historically those ending in .2, such as 3.2, 4.2, and 5.2 — are designed as Long-Term Support (LTS) releases, receiving all security and data loss fixes for three years.\nAlthough updating every LTS release is one option, it is heartening to see so many Django developers opting for the latest release, as this ensures you are receiving the latest and greatest version of the framework. It is also far easier to update incrementally, with every feature release, rather than waiting a few years in between.\npytest Prevails\nIn the words of Django co-creator Jacob Kaplan-Moss, “Code without tests is broken by design.” Django has its own testing framework built on top of Python’s unittest library, which provides extra features tailored for web applications. Many developers also use `pytest`–similarly popular in the broader Python community–for even more testing help.\nThe survey showed that `pytest` remains the most popular option for testing Django projects, at 39%, followed closely by `unittest`, at 33%. Two Django-specific plugins, `pytest-django` and `django-test-plus`, also received strong support. The `coverage` library was used by 21% of developers; it provides a useful way to measure the test coverage present in a project. Further down the list were end-to-end testing options, such as Selenium and Playwright.\n\n\n\n\nThese results are consistent with others in the Python ecosystem: `unittest` and `pytest` are, by far, the two dominant ways to test Python libraries, so it is no surprise to see both rank so highly here.\nActionable Ideas\nNow that you’ve read my take on the highlights from this year’s results, what are the next steps? First, know that Django is a mature, boring technology by design; you can carry on being productive with your work, updating to the latest versions of Python and Django, and have confidence that the rug won’t be pulled out from under you with breaking changes.\nBut the broader Python and open-source ecosystems continue to innovate and mutate, and there are definitely productivity gains to be had if you experiment a little. In that spirit, here are four actionable ideas you can pursue:\nAction 1: Try out HTMX\nIf you haven’t yet taken the time to find out what the excitement is about, head over to the Examples section on the HTMX website to see common UI improvements. It is almost as easy as copy and paste for many interactive elements; there’s no need to fire up a dedicated JavaScript framework to achieve similar results.\nAction 2: Experiment with AI\nThe momentum is clearly swinging towards some flavor of AI tools becoming part of the standard Django developer workflow, although there is no clear consensus on what exactly that entails. \nOn one end of the spectrum are developers who want minimal to no assistance: catch typos and obvious language errors, nothing else, thank you. A step up are autocomplete options of various degrees, followed by chat-assisted programming, which includes either code snippets or entire codebases, and then asks the LLM questions about it. The final frontier, at the moment, is agents that can take a prompt and attempt to solve it on their own. \nMost Django developers are somewhere in the model, experimenting with these new AI tools, but not fully sold. As the tools and the IDE integrations improve over the next year, it will be interesting to see what next year’s survey respondents report in terms of their AI usage.\nAction 3: Update to the Latest Version of Django \nThe best way to take advantage of all that Django and Python have to offer is to be on the latest release. Both are mature and rarely implement breaking changes, so this has never been easier. In production codebases with tests, updates should be as straightforward as updating the version number, running the test suite, and fixing any errors that emerge.\nStaying current is like performing maintenance on your car: much easier to do a bit every so often rather than wait a few years before something breaks. It also means you are on the most secure and performant version of your tools.\nAction 4: Stay Informed of the Django Ecosystem\nDjango is a batteries-included framework and ecosystem: there is a lot going on. This can feel overwhelming at times, but the good news is that there are resources in whatever medium you prefer to keep you informed, from the official Django website to podcasts, newsletters, conferences, and more. The recently launched Django ecosystem page is a great starting point. \nInterested in learning more? Check out the complete Django Developers Survey Results here.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Let’s see how this works with Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains.\nWhat you’ll get from this guide\nDeveloping complex software features can be daunting. Such tasks often feel overwhelming due to the sheer size of the codebase, the uncertainty of dependencies, and the difficulty of keeping all requirements in mind. With the advent of AI coding agents like Junie, developers now have powerful new assistants to help them navigate this complexity.\nHowever, there’s a catch: these agents are most effective when they’re given clear structure and guidance. Handing them a vague instruction like “refactor this module” can result in unpredictable outcomes. The key lies in refining high-level requirements into a detailed development plan and task list. This structured approach ensures clarity, control, and predictability, turning ambitious goals into manageable, trackable units of work.\nStart with clear requirements\nEvery project starts with an idea of what needs to be built. Maybe you’re cleaning up legacy code, replacing an outdated algorithm, adding tests to a neglected module, or introducing persistence for new data. While these are all valid goals, they are too broad for an AI agent to act on directly.\nThat’s where high-level requirements come in. They describe what should happen, not how to do it. Think of them as your North Star: a short list of desired outcomes that provides context for the agent without boxing it in. Writing them down in a file, say requirements.md, is a small step that pays off later. It gives both you and the agent a shared starting point that doesn’t vanish after one conversation.\n\n\n\n\nSure, agents like Junie can scan your project and suggest improvements on their own. But when you define the initial direction yourself, you set the boundaries and priorities. You tell the agent what matters, and in return, the agent will help you to figure out how to get there. That’s a much better deal than letting AI guess.\nGenerating a detailed development plan\nOnce you’ve written down the high-level requirements, it’s time to move from what needs to be done to how you might approach it. This is where the development plan comes in. It’s a bridge between the big picture and the actual implementation.\nAsk Junie to read your requirements.md file and create a detailed implementation plan in plan.md. This step is important: you’re not asking the AI agent to start coding yet. You’re asking it to think first. It makes sense to enable the Think More toggle to force the agent to refine the plan in more details. “Think More” encourages Junie to think more deeply. It uses the LLM’s reasoning parameter and adjusts prompts and workflow to facilitate more careful thinking and result verification.\nBy writing the plan into a file, you create a checkpoint – a space where you can review the strategy before any code changes happen.\n\n\n\n\nA good plan outlines the approach, the sequence of work, and potential risks. Junie sometimes includes small code examples to illustrate ideas. That’s fine, but if you prefer a higher-level overview, you can tell it to focus only on the “what,” not the “how.” The goal is to create a document that describes the steps needed to turn your requirements into reality – something you can read, tweak, and approve before moving on.\nThis stage feels slower, but it’s where you gain control. You trade a bit of setup time for clarity and predictability later. The result? The agent doesn’t run off and “improve” parts of your project you didn’t ask it to touch.\nHere is the prompt for you to try:\nRead the contents of requirements.md and create a detailed development plan\ndescribing how to implement these requirements.\n\nThe plan should include:\n\n– A short overview of the goal.\n\n– The main steps or phases required to achieve it.\n\n– Any dependencies, risks, or considerations to keep in mind.\n\nDo not write or modify any code yet. Save the plan as plan.md.\n\n\n\n\nTip: If you prefer a strategy-only document, phrase your prompt explicitly: “Generate a plan focusing only on what needs to be done, without code examples.”\nCreating a task list for execution\nNow that the plan is in place, you have a solid overview of what needs to happen. However, plans are rarely ready to execute as is. They contain a mix of strategy, commentary, and implementation hints. The next step to making them useful in practice is breaking the plan down into a clear, ordered list of tasks that the agent can follow and that you can track.\nAsk Junie to take plan.md as input and based on that create a task list for implementing this plan, and store it in the tasks.md file, where each item represents a verifiable action. \nThe tasks should be specific enough that you can mark them as complete once finished, but not so granular that they devolve into meaningless busywork. Think “implement new data repository” rather than “write a function.”\n\n\n\n\nThis file becomes your control panel. It gives you a persistent, external record of what’s happening, independent of Junie’s internal context. You can review, reorder, or refine tasks at any time. You can also tell Junie to complete the next task, mark it as done, and then stop.\nIn short, plan.md explains the approach, but tasks.md makes it actionable. It turns the agent’s abstract reasoning into a list of steps you can monitor. That’s how you move from theory to execution without losing control of the process.\nHere’s a sample prompt:\nRead the contents of plan.md and generate a detailed, enumerated task list based on it.\n\nEach task should be clear, actionable, and written in a way that allows it to be marked as completed once done.\n\nMaintain a logical order of execution. Group the tasks logically into phases.\n\nSave the result as tasks.md, formatted as a numbered list with checkboxes (for example, - [ ] Implement data repository).\n\nDo not start implementing any tasks yet—only create the list.\nThe resulting markdown file will look like this:\n\n\n\n\nTip: Think of tasks.md as your project manager’s checklist – persistent, reviewable, and external to Junie’s memory.\nManaging execution and workflow with precision\nWith the task list in place, you’re ready to execute. Keep in mind, that the execution is a phase where control really matters. AI agents work best when they focus on a bounded unit of work, rather than trying to do everything simultaneously.\nBest Practices for Execution:\nWork in phases. Don’t ask Junie to “do everything in tasks.md” in one go. Instead, start with a subset: “Complete tasks 1–2 from tasks.md and mark them as completed.”\n\nMark progress. Require Junie to update tasks.md with checkmarks or completion notes. This gives you visibility into what’s done and what remains.\n\n\n\n\nReview after each phase. Before moving to the next set of tasks, review code changes, run tests, and confirm correctness.\n\n\n\n\nControl pacing. If a task uncovers unexpected complexity, update the task list to reflect new sub-tasks before proceeding.\nThis “controlled iteration” workflow keeps you firmly in the driver’s seat while still taking advantage of Junie’s ability to rapidly implement code.\nTip: Use descriptive prompts like:\nProceed with the implementation steps for Phase 1 according to the tasks listed in tasks.md. \nMark the tasks as done [x] upon completion\nThis phrasing naturally enforces boundaries, scoped to the tasks in Phase 1, without requiring a built-in stop command.\nComplete prompt for spec-driven development with Junie\nAll of the above practices are very generic and should work for any AI coding agent. However, the different agents have subtle differences in their configurations, instructions, and rules. This time we create a complete prompt that will prepare the spec-driven workflow artifacts, including requirements.md, plan.md, and tasks.md files, but also update the agent guidelines (.junie/guidelines.md).\nPaste this prompt into the Junie input and add your high-level task description into the input section in the prompt.\n# Spec-Driven Development Prompt\n\nTransform the provided high-level requirements into a complete set of project planning artifacts for spec-driven development.  \n\n## Instructions:\n\nYou must produce **four files** inside the `docs/` and `.junie/` directories:  \n\n- `docs/requirements.md`  \n- `docs/plan.md`  \n- `docs/tasks.md`  \n- `.junie/guidelines.md`  \n\nFollow the methodology below step by step:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Create `docs/requirements.md`\n\n- Title: **Requirements Document**  \n- Introduction: Summarize the application purpose and key functionality.  \n- Requirements section:  \n\n  - Use sequential numbering (1, 2, 3, …).  \n  - Each requirement must include:  \n    - **User Story** in the format:  \n\n      > As a user, I want [goal] so that [benefit/reason]  \n\n    - **Acceptance Criteria** in the format:  \n\n      > WHEN [condition] THEN the system SHALL [expected behavior]  \n\n- Guidelines:  \n\n  - Focus on user goals and benefits.  \n  - Make acceptance criteria specific, testable, and precise.  \n  - Cover normal flows, edge cases, error handling, persistence, and UI/UX.  \n  - Group related requirements logically.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Create `docs/plan.md`\n\n- Analyze `docs/requirements.md`.  \n- Develop a **detailed implementation plan**:  \n  - Link each plan item explicitly to the corresponding requirements.  \n  - Assign priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).  \n  - Group related plan items logically.  \n- Ensure comprehensive coverage of all requirements.  \n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Create `docs/tasks.md`\n\n- Based on the implementation plan in `docs/plan.md`, produce a **detailed enumerated technical task list**:  \n\n  - Each task must have a placeholder `[ ]` to mark completion.  \n  - Link each task both to:  \n    - the development plan item in `docs/plan.md`  \n    - the related requirement(s) in `docs/requirements.md`  \n- Group tasks into **development phases**.  \n- Organize phases logically (e.g., Setup → Core Features → Advanced Features → Testing & QA).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Update `.junie/guidelines.md`\n\n- Add **concise technical instructions** on how to work with the `docs/tasks.md` checklist.  \n- Instructions should include:  \n  - Mark tasks as `[x]` when completed.  \n  - Keep phases intact but add new tasks if needed.  \n  - Ensure every new or modified task stays linked to a requirement and plan item.  \n  - Keep formatting consistent with the existing style.  \n\n---\n\n## Input:\n\n[INSERT YOUR HIGH-LEVEL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE APPLICATION YOU WANT TO CREATE; ASK THE USER]  \n\n## Output:\n\n1. `docs/requirements.md` – structured requirements document  \n2. `docs/plan.md` – implementation plan with priorities and links  \n3. `docs/tasks.md` – detailed enumerated task list grouped into phases  \n4. `.junie/guidelines.md` – updated concise instructions for working with the task list\nConclusion\nSpec-driven development brings structure to how you work with AI agents. First, you establish clear requirements. Then, you refine them into a plan and break that plan down into tasks that the agent can execute step by step.\n\nThe real benefit here is a control. Instead of asking the agent to build an entire feature in one go, you guide it through small, scoped patches. You stay in the loop by reviewing, adjusting, and approving each change without losing perspective on the bigger goal.\nIt’s a steady, transparent way to develop complex software with AI: you keep the direction, the agent keeps the momentum.",

Supporting 40,000+ organizations across industries like finance, legal, and IT, BoldSign had to offer fast, secure document signing at scale without slowing down its own development cycles in the process. \nBut as adoption grew, so did the platform’s complexity.\n“We faced performance issues like freezes. It was tough to introduce modern coding practices while dealing with slowness.”\n– George Livingston Arulvetham, Head of Product, BoldSign\nRead the full Syncfusion/BoldSign case study for details.\nLike many .NET teams, BoldSign’s growing codebase and fragmented tooling made it hard to maintain momentum. The team needed an integrated environment that could keep up with a modern full-stack (.NET Core with Vue/React), containerized workflows, and cross-functional collaboration. \nA different approach to productivity\nAs development became more complex, so did the need for better tools.\nThe BoldSign team evaluated JetBrains Rider for performance and adopted JetBrains dotUltimate to bring multiple tools into one cohesive experience. Builds now complete in 15–20 seconds and the team reports no more freezing or slowness, even with large solutions.\nAdoption ramped steadily: A few engineers tried Rider, then more followed—today it’s the team standard. Beyond Rider, BoldSign uses dotTrace and dotMemory plus integrated database tooling (based on DataGrip) under a single organizational license. \nFrom code to quality: Catching issues earlier\nRider’s code analysis helped BoldSign raise quality without disrupting workflows.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe team also standardized on a shared .editorconfig, reducing style inconsistencies and PR friction from day one. \nDiagnosing performance before it’s a problem\nFor a platform that processes large batches of PDF and image files, performance isn’t optional. With dotTrace and dotMemory, the team traced a stubborn memory leak within minutes and reports roughly halved profiling time. Overall, profiling/debugging times are down 25–50%. \n“Switching to JetBrains Rider reduced build and debug cycles by over 30%. With faster builds, integrated tools, and smooth debugging, Rider enabled us to ship faster while maintaining high code quality – a game-changer for our fast-moving e-signature SaaS product.”\n– George Livingston Arulvetham, Head of Product, BoldSign \nAgentic AI development\nBoldSign’s engineers extended Rider with an in-house AI plugin that automates repetitive deployment steps. It supports multiple AI models, meets security requirements, and avoids extra licensing costs, keeping developers in their everyday IDE workflow. \nAutomates deployment boilerplate directly inside Rider\nLets the team switch between AI models as needs change\nNow an everyday productivity booster\nNext step: evaluate JetBrains AI Assistant alongside their bespoke solution \nFrom many tools to one workspace\nPreviously, engineers switched between external tools to manage PostgreSQL and Cosmos DB. Now they work inside Rider using built-in database tooling powered by DataGrip—with IntelliSense, result filtering, and safe read-only production access—reducing context switching and errors. \nOnboarding that works at scale\nNew engineers receive a JetBrains license on day one and follow an internal wiki with short screen-casts on Rider, dotTrace, and dotMemory. A shared .editorconfig enforces code style from the first commit, helping hires reach full productivity in about one month. \nResults that speak for themselves\nSince moving to JetBrains dotUltimate, BoldSign reports:\n~30% faster development cycles (measured internally)\n1–2 minute builds reduced to 15–20 seconds\n25–50% time savings in profiling/debugging\nZero performance complaints since switching\nConsistent code quality via standardized formatting and smart guidance\nLooking ahead\nAs BoldSign continues to scale, the tools provided by dotUltimate—Rider, dotTrace, dotMemory, and powerful DataGrip-based database management—are integral to how the team ships software. \n“We’re a very happy customer. That’s why we’re sharing this story. We want other teams to benefit the way we have.”\n– George Livingston Arulvetham, Head of Product, BoldSign\nLearn more\nInterested in streamlining your development workflows with Rider, dotTrace, dotMemory, and integrated database tooling powered by DataGrip? → Learn more about JetBrains dotUltimate.\n→ Learn more about JetBrains dotUltimate\n→ Contact us to request a demo or speak with sales",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\nPython’s flexibility and ease of use make it a go-to language for developers, but its interpreted nature and global interpreter lock (GIL) can lead to performance bottlenecks, especially in large-scale or resource-intensive applications. Whether you’re building web servers, data pipelines, or real-time systems, optimizing Python code can save time, reduce costs, and improve the user experience. \nDrawing from practical examples and insights from the Python community, this article explores proven performance hacks to help your applications run faster and more smoothly.\nUnderstanding Python’s performance characteristics\nPython’s interpreted nature fundamentally shapes its performance profile. Unlike compiled languages, like C, C++, or Rust, that translate source code directly into machine code before execution, Python follows a multi-step process that introduces inherent overhead. \nWhen you run a Python script, the interpreter first compiles your source code into bytecode – a lower-level, platform-independent representation. This bytecode is then executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which translates each instruction into machine code at runtime.\nThis interpretation layer, while providing Python’s trademark flexibility and cross-platform compatibility, comes with a performance cost. Each line of code must be processed and translated during execution, creating a bottleneck that becomes particularly pronounced in computation-heavy scenarios.\nThe global interpreter lock challenge\nCompounding Python’s interpreted nature is the global interpreter lock (GIL) – arguably one of the most significant performance limitations in CPython. The GIL is a mutex (mutual exclusion lock) that ensures only one thread can execute Python bytecode at any given moment, even on multi-core systems. While this design simplifies memory management and prevents race conditions in CPython’s internals, it effectively serializes execution for CPU-bound tasks.\nThe GIL’s impact varies significantly depending on your workload. I/O-bound operations – such as file reading, network requests, or database queries – can release the GIL during blocking operations, allowing other threads to proceed. However, CPU-intensive tasks like mathematical computations, data processing, or algorithmic operations remain largely single-threaded, unable to leverage multiple CPU cores through traditional threading.\nWith and without GIL\n\n\n\n\nCPU cores detected: 32\nWorkers: 4\n———————————————-\n=== GIL-BOUND: pure Python loop ===\nSingle thread (py): 0.86s\nThreads x4 (py): 3.24s\nProcesses x4 (py): 0.85s\n———————————————-\n=== GIL-RELEASED: PBKDF2 in C (hashlib) ===\nSingle thread (pbkdf2): 0.25s\nThreads x4 (pbkdf2): 0.67s\nProcesses x4 (pbkdf2): 0.31s\nBeyond language limitations: Code-level performance issues\nWhile Python’s architectural constraints are well-documented, many performance problems stem from suboptimal coding practices that are entirely within developers’ control. These inefficiencies can dwarf the overhead introduced by interpretation and the GIL, making code optimization both critical and highly impactful.\nCommon performance pitfalls include:\nUnnecessary looping\nString concatenation in loops\nNot using built-in functions or libraries\nMisusing lists instead of appropriate data structures\nOverusing global variables\nNot using generators for large datasets\nIgnoring the GIL in CPU-bound tasks\nExcessive function calls or recursion\nNot profiling or benchmarking\nOverusing list comprehensions for side effects\nRepeatedly accessing object attributes\nNot using enumerate() for index tracking\nInefficient dictionary key checks\nCopying large data structures unnecessarily\nIgnoring exception handling overhead\nOverusing regular expressions\nNot batching I/O operations\nDynamic type checking overhead\nNot using context managers for resources\nThe critical importance of optimization\nUnderstanding why performance optimization matters requires examining its impact across multiple dimensions of software development and deployment.\nResource efficiency and infrastructure costs\nUnoptimized code creates a cascading effect on system resources. CPU-intensive operations that could run in seconds might take minutes, tying up processors and preventing other tasks from executing efficiently. Memory inefficiencies can lead to excessive RAM usage, forcing systems to rely on slower disk-based virtual memory. Poor I/O patterns can saturate network connections or overwhelm storage systems.\nIn cloud environments, these inefficiencies translate directly into financial costs. Cloud providers charge based on resource consumption – CPU time, memory usage, storage operations, and network bandwidth. \nA poorly optimized algorithm that runs 10 times slower doesn’t just delay results; it increases your cloud bill by an order of magnitude. For organizations processing large datasets or serving high-traffic applications, these costs can quickly escalate from hundreds to thousands of dollars monthly.\nScalability and system limits\nPerformance issues that seem manageable during development or small-scale testing become exponentially worse under production loads. An application that handles dozens of users might crumble under thousands. A data processing pipeline that works with gigabytes of data might fail entirely when faced with terabytes.\nScalability challenges often emerge at predictable inflection points. Database queries that perform adequately with thousands of records may time out with millions. Web applications that respond quickly to individual requests may become unresponsive when handling concurrent users. Background processing jobs that complete within acceptable timeframes during off-peak hours may fall behind during high-demand periods, creating growing backlogs that eventually overwhelm the system.\nPoor performance characteristics make horizontal scaling – adding more servers or instances – less effective and more expensive. Instead of smoothly distributing load across additional resources, inefficient code often creates bottlenecks that prevent proper load distribution. This forces organizations to over-provision resources or implement complex workarounds that increase system complexity and operational overhead.\nUser experience and competitive advantage\nIn user-facing applications, performance directly impacts user satisfaction and business outcomes. Research consistently shows that users abandon applications and websites that respond slowly, with abandonment rates increasing dramatically for delays exceeding 2–3 seconds. Mobile applications face even stricter performance expectations, as users expect instant responsiveness despite potentially limited processing power and network connectivity.\nDevelopment velocity and technical debt\nCounter-intuitively, investing in performance optimization often accelerates development velocity over time. Slow test suites discourage frequent testing, leading to longer feedback cycles and increased bug detection costs. Development environments that respond sluggishly reduce programmer productivity and increase context-switching overhead. Build and deployment processes that take excessive time slow down iteration cycles and delay feature releases.\nPerformance problems also compound over time, creating technical debt that becomes increasingly expensive to address. Code that performs adequately during initial development may degrade as features are added, data volumes grow, or usage patterns evolve. Early investment in performance-conscious design and optimization practices prevents this degradation and maintains system responsiveness as complexity increases.\nOperational stability and reliability\nPerformance and reliability are intimately connected. Systems operating near their performance limits are inherently fragile, with little headroom to handle traffic spikes, data volume increases, or unexpected load patterns. What appears to be a reliability issue – application crashes, timeouts, or service unavailability – often traces back to performance problems that exhaust system resources or exceed operational thresholds.\nOptimized code provides operational resilience by maintaining acceptable performance even under stressful conditions. This resilience translates into better uptime, fewer emergency interventions, and more predictable system behavior. Organizations with performance-optimized systems spend less time firefighting production issues and more time delivering value to users.\nThe strategic imperative\nPerformance optimization isn’t merely a technical consideration – it’s a strategic business imperative that affects costs, user satisfaction, competitive positioning, and operational efficiency. While Python’s interpreted nature and GIL limitations create inherent performance constraints, the majority of performance issues stem from code-level inefficiencies that skilled developers can identify and address.\nThe key is approaching performance optimization systematically, with clear metrics, targeted improvements, and continuous monitoring. Rather than premature optimization that complicates code without measurable benefit, effective performance work focuses on identifying actual bottlenecks, implementing proven optimization techniques, and measuring results to ensure improvements deliver real value.\nDispelling common performance myths\nBefore exploring optimization techniques, it’s crucial to address widespread misconceptions that can lead developers down unproductive paths or cause them to dismiss Python entirely for performance-critical applications.\nMyth 1: Python is universally slow\nThis oversimplification ignores Python’s nuanced performance characteristics and the critical distinction between different types of computational workloads. Python’s performance varies dramatically depending on the nature of the task and how the code leverages the broader Python ecosystem.\nFor I/O-bound operations – tasks that spend most of their time waiting for external resources like file systems, databases, or network services – Python’s interpreted overhead becomes largely irrelevant. When your program spends 95% of its time waiting for a database query to complete or a web API to respond, the few milliseconds of interpretation overhead pale in comparison to the I/O latency. In these scenarios, Python’s expressiveness and rapid development capabilities far outweigh any performance concerns.\nMyth 2: The GIL eliminates all concurrency benefits\nThe global interpreter lock’s impact on performance is frequently misunderstood, leading developers to either avoid threading entirely or attempt inappropriate parallelization strategies. The reality is more nuanced and depends heavily on workload characteristics.\nFor I/O-bound tasks, threading remains highly effective despite the GIL. When a thread initiates an I/O operation – whether reading from disk, making a network request, or querying a database – it releases the GIL, allowing other threads to execute Python code. This means that a multi-threaded web scraper can achieve significant performance improvements by processing multiple requests concurrently, even though each individual request involves Python code execution.\nThe distinction is clear when comparing CPU-bound versus I/O-bound scenarios. A single-threaded program making sequential HTTP requests will be limited by network latency, regardless of CPU speed. Adding threads allows multiple requests to proceed simultaneously, dramatically reducing total execution time. Conversely, a CPU-intensive calculation like computing prime numbers or processing images will see minimal benefit from threading due to GIL contention.\nUnderstanding this distinction enables appropriate tool selection. Threading excels for I/O-bound parallelism, while CPU-bound tasks benefit from multiprocessing (which bypasses the GIL by using separate processes) or specialized libraries that release the GIL during computation-intensive operations.\nMyth 3: Hardware upgrades substitute for code optimization\nThe temptation to solve performance problems by upgrading hardware is understandable, but often ineffective and economically wasteful. While faster processors, additional memory, or improved storage can provide linear performance improvements, they cannot overcome fundamental algorithmic inefficiencies that exhibit quadratic, cubic, or exponential time complexity.\nConsider a sorting algorithm comparison: Upgrading from a 2GHz to a 4GHz processor will make Bubble Sort run twice as fast, but switching from Bubble Sort (O(n²)) to Quick Sort (O(n log n)) provides exponentially greater improvements as data size increases. For sorting 10,000 elements, the algorithmic improvement might yield a 100x speed gain, while the hardware upgrade provides only a 2x improvement.\nThis principle scales to real-world applications. A database query with poor indexing won’t be significantly helped by faster hardware, but adding appropriate indexes can reduce execution time from minutes to milliseconds. A web application that loads entire datasets into memory for simple filtering operations will struggle regardless of available RAM, but implementing database-level filtering can reduce both memory usage and execution time by orders of magnitude.\nHardware upgrades also carry ongoing costs in cloud environments. A poorly optimized application might require a server instance with 16 CPU cores and 64GB of RAM, while an optimized version could run efficiently on 2 cores and 8GB of RAM. Over time, the cost difference becomes substantial, especially when multiplied across multiple environments or scaled to handle increasing load.\nMyth 4: Performance optimization is about intuition and experience\nThe belief that experienced developers can reliably identify performance bottlenecks through code review or intuition leads to wasted effort and suboptimal results. Human intuition about code performance is notoriously unreliable, especially in high-level languages like Python where the relationship between source code and actual execution patterns is complex.\nProfiling tools provide objective, quantitative data about where programs actually spend their time, often revealing surprising results. That nested loop you suspected was the bottleneck might account for only 2% of execution time, while an innocuous-looking string operation consumes 60% of runtime. Library calls that appear lightweight might involve substantial overhead, while seemingly expensive operations might be highly optimized.\nTools like cProfile, line_profiler, and memory_profiler remove guesswork by providing detailed breakdowns of function call frequency, execution time, and resource usage. These tools not only identify actual bottlenecks but also quantify the potential impact of optimizations, helping prioritize improvement efforts.\nProfiling also reveals performance patterns that aren’t immediately obvious from source code inspection. Garbage collection overhead, import costs, attribute access patterns, and memory allocation behavior all contribute to runtime performance in ways that static analysis cannot predict. Data-driven optimization based on profiling results consistently outperforms intuition-based approaches.\nMoving beyond misconceptions\nRecognizing these myths enables more strategic thinking about Python performance optimization. Rather than dismissing Python for performance-sensitive applications or attempting blanket optimizations, developers can make informed decisions about when and how to optimize based on actual usage patterns and measured performance characteristics.\nThe key insight is that Python performance optimization is contextual and empirical. Understanding your specific workload characteristics, measuring actual performance bottlenecks, and selecting appropriate optimization strategies based on data rather than assumptions will yield far better results than following generic performance advice or avoiding Python entirely due to perceived limitations.\nThe critical role of profiling and benchmarking\nEffective performance optimization relies on measurement, not guesswork. Without systematic profiling and benchmarking, optimization efforts often miss the actual bottlenecks and waste valuable development time on improvements that don’t matter.\nWhy intuition fails\nDeveloper intuition about performance is notoriously unreliable. We naturally focus on complex-looking code, assuming it’s slow, while overlooking simple operations that actually dominate runtime. Python’s high-level abstractions make this worse – an innocent list comprehension might trigger massive memory allocations, while an apparently expensive algorithm contributes negligibly to total execution time.\nProfiling: Finding the real bottlenecks\nProfiling tools provide objective data about where your program actually spends time. Tools like cProfile show which functions are called most frequently and consume the most time, while line_profiler pinpoints specific statements within functions. Memory profilers track allocation patterns and identify memory leaks that trigger excessive garbage collection.\nThis data-driven approach replaces guesswork with facts. Instead of optimizing code that looks slow, you optimize the functions that actually dominate your application’s runtime.\nBenchmarking: Measuring success\nBenchmarking quantifies whether your optimizations actually work. Without systematic measurement, you can’t know if changes improve performance, by how much, or under what conditions.\nEffective benchmarking requires running multiple iterations to account for system variability, using representative datasets that match production workloads, and testing both isolated functions (microbenchmarks) and complete workflows (end-to-end benchmarks).\nBenchmarking with cProfile\nBenchmarking with cProfile reveals slow functions and call counts. For example, profiling a naive Fibonacci function shows millions of recursive calls, but memoization reduces this dramatically:\n# Naive Fibonacci\ndef fib(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)\n\ndef process_data(n):\n    results = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        results.append(fib(i) * 2)\n    return results\n\nimport cProfile\ncProfile.run(\"process_data(30)\")\n# Output: 4356620 function calls in 4.239 seconds\n\n# With memoization\ndef fib_memo(n, memo={}):\n    if n in memo:\n        return memo[n]\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    memo[n] = fib_memo(n-1, memo) + fib_memo(n-2, memo)\n    return memo[n]\n\ndef process_data_fast(n):\n    return [fib_memo(i) * 2 for i in range(n)]\n\ncProfile.run(\"process_data_fast(30)\")\n# Output: 91 function calls in 0.000 seconds\nTime measured:\nNaive Fibonacci: Output: 4,356,620 function calls in 4.239 seconds\n4356620 function calls (64 primitive calls) in 1.646 seconds\n\n   Ordered by: standard name\n\n   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n4356586/30    1.646    0.000    1.646    0.055 <ipython-input-45-6e8c229d1114>:3(fib)\n        1    0.000    0.000    1.646    1.646 <ipython-input-45-6e8c229d1114>:8(process_data)\n        1    0.000    0.000    1.646    1.646 <string>:1(<module>)\n        1    0.000    0.000    1.646    1.646 {built-in method builtins.exec}\n       30    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'append' of 'list' objects}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}\nWith memoization: 91 function calls in 0.000 seconds – Memoization helps by storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again.\n91 function calls (35 primitive calls) in 0.000 seconds\nOrdered by: standard name\n\n   ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <ipython-input-46-d2e1a597ad5b>:12(process_data_fast)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <ipython-input-46-d2e1a597ad5b>:13(<listcomp>)\n    86/30    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <ipython-input-46-d2e1a597ad5b>:4(fib_memo)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 <string>:1(<module>)\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {built-in method builtins.exec}\n        1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 {method 'disable' of '_lsprof.Profiler' objects}\nBenchmarking with time and timeit\ntime: Offers quick runtime estimates for rough comparisons.\ntimeit: Ideal for benchmarking small snippets and running them multiple times for accuracy.

Open your project\nOpen the Python project you want to analyze in PyCharm.\n2. Choose the file or function to profile\nOpen the Python file you want to profile. You can profile a full script or specific test functions.\n3. Run with the PyCharm profiler\nYou have two main options:\nOption A: Profile a script\nRight-click the Python script (e.g. main.py).\n\n\n\n\nSelect: Profile ‘<script name>’\n\nOption B: Use the menu\nGo to Run | Profile…\n\nChoose your script or configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Wait for execution\nThe script will run normally, but PyCharm will collect profiling data in the background.\n5. View profiling results\nOnce execution completes:\nPyCharm will open the Profiler window.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll then see:\nThe function call hierarchy\n\n\n\n\nThe execution time per function\n\n\n\n\nThe number of calls\n\n\n\n\nCPU time vs. wall time\n\n\n\n\nCall graphs (optional)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can sort by time, filter functions, and drill down into nested calls.\nUnderstanding the profiling report\nThe PyCharm IDE runs a Python script (test.py) that compares the performance of a naive Fibonacci implementation with a memoized version. The built-in profiler’s Statistics tab is open, revealing that the naive fib function was called over 4.3 million times, taking 603 ms in total, while the memoized version completed almost instantly.\n\n\n\n\nWe benchmark naive versus memoized Fibonacci calculations. The built-in profiler is open in the Flame Graph view, visually illustrating that the naive fib function dominates the execution time, while the memoized version’s impact is negligible, highlighting the performance gains from memoization.\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm spotlights a classic bottleneck: A naive Fibonacci thrashes in recursion while the memoized path sails through. The Call Tree view lays it bare – two deep fib branches swallow essentially the entire 603 ms runtime:\nIt attributes ~100% of total time to process_data() → fib(), split across the left/right recursive calls (~301 ms each).\n\n\n\n\n\nThis symmetry is typical of the exponential fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) pattern without caching.\n\n\n\n\nSince the memoized version doesn’t meaningfully appear in the tree, it indicates near-zero overhead after warm-up – evidence that memoization collapses the exponential recursion into linear-time lookups.\n\n\n\n\nTakeaway: for overlapping subproblems (like Fibonacci), memoization transforms runtime from O(φ^n) to O(n) and eliminates the recursion-dominated hotspots you see here.\n\n\n\n\nIn the PyCharm profiler’s Method List view, the naive Fibonacci routine makes its dominance clear – fib() consumes nearly all of the 603 ms execution time, while process_data() and the module’s entry point simply act as conduits:\nThe table shows fib() at 301 ms per branch, totaling the full runtime, which aligns with the exponential recursion tree where both subcalls expand almost equally.\nThe “Own Execution Time” column confirms that most of the cost is in the recursive body itself, not in overhead from process_data() or I/O.\nNo memoized calls appear here because the fast version runs so quickly it barely registers on the profiler. The pattern is a textbook example of performance profiling – identifying the hotspot and confirming that optimization should target the recursive core rather than the surrounding code.\n\n\n\n\nThe PyCharm profiler’s Call Graph view paints a clear picture –fib() dominates the execution time in bright red, clocking 603 ms over 4.3 million calls, while everything else barely registers.\nThe red nodes in the graph highlight performance hotspots, with fib() responsible for 100% of the total runtime. Both process_data() and the module’s main entry point route directly into this costly recursion, confirming there’s no other significant time sink.\nGreen nodes like fib_mem0() and append() in lists indicate negligible runtime impact, which aligns with the near-instant memoized execution path.\nThe visualization makes the optimization priority obvious – replace or cache the expensive fib() calls, and the program’s runtime collapses from hundreds of milliseconds to near zero.\nIn summary\nOptimize when your code creates noticeable bottlenecks in critical processes, especially as workloads grow. Key triggers include rising cloud costs from inefficient resource usage, user-facing delays (even 100 ms can hurt engagement), and when moving from prototype to production.\nPerformance optimization delivers efficiency gains, enables scalability for growth, controls costs, provides competitive advantages, ensures reliability under pressure, and improves user satisfaction.\nHow to approach optimization\nFollow a systematic approach. Profile first to identify real bottlenecks rather than guessing, leverage established libraries like NumPy and pandas, prioritize algorithmic improvements (better Big O complexity beats micro-optimizations), and always measure results to verify improvements.\nCPU-bound vs I/O-bound operations\nCPU-bound tasks are limited by processor speed and include computations like mathematical calculations, image processing, and machine learning training. Python’s global interpreter lock (GIL) restricts true multithreading for these tasks.\nI/O-bound operations involve waiting for input/output like file reads, network requests, or database queries. The CPU remains mostly idle during these operations, making them less affected by the GIL.\nGeneral optimization principles\nMeasure first: Use profiling tools (cProfile, timeit, line_profiler) to identify bottlenecks. Optimizing without data is guesswork.\nChoose the right tool: Match algorithms, data structures, and concurrency models to your task (CPU-bound vs. I/O-bound).\nMinimize overhead: Reduce Python’s interpretive and dynamic nature where it slows you down.\nTrade-offs: Balance speed, memory, and readability based on your needs.\nAbout the author\nDido Grigorov\nDido is a seasoned Deep Learning Engineer and Python programmer with an impressive 17 years of experience in the field.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis post opens The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\n                  “You don’t flip a switch to ‘go Kotlin’.\n                  You de-risk, you measure, you celebrate the wins,\n                   and only then do you double down.”\nAdopting Kotlin in an established Java environment isn’t just a technical decision – it’s a journey that requires careful planning, strategic thinking, and most importantly, winning the hearts and minds of your peers. \nAfter training over 1,000 developers and helping numerous organizations successfully transition to Kotlin, I’ve seen what works and what doesn’t. This guide will walk you through successful recipes for adopting Kotlin, which I have collected over time, from your first experimental playground to large-scale organizational transformation.\nThis is the journey this series will take you through:\nIt Always Starts With a Spark, Initiated by You!\nThe Play Around Stage: Start Small – With Tests\nThe Evaluation Stage: Beyond Kotlin as a Playground\nSpread the Word: Win the Hearts & Minds of Your Fellow Developers\nPersuading Management: Building the Business Case for Kotlin\nSuccess Factors for Large-Scale Kotlin Adoption\nTo Kotlin or Not to Kotlin: What Kind of Company Do You Want to Be?\nIt Always Starts With a Spark, Initiated by You!\n\n\n\n\nWhy take the effort to switch to Kotlin? Why not just stick with Java and move on? \nThe answer depends on numerous factors. While the data clearly shows Kotlin’s advantages across multiple domains, the decision isn’t purely technical. Subjectivity (“I like my language because I like it”) and skepticism towards something new, which is generally a good thing, play an important role. \nHowever, the evolution of programming languages shows that our preferences and needs change over time. Crucially, each new generation of languages incorporates fresh paradigms – (null)-safety, concise and light-weight syntax, functions as first class citizens, rich standard library, async concurrency, multiplatform support, generative-AI friendly, etc. – that give developers and organizations a decisive advantage. \nWithout this natural progression, we’d still be coding everything in COBOL or another archaic language, unable to meet today’s demands. Evolution is therefore not optional; it’s built into the history of our industry.\nFor this evolution to take root inside a company, though, it takes more than technical merit. It requires enablers – people willing to explore, advocate, and show the value of these new paradigms in practice. In my experience, three types of engineers typically become these catalysts for Kotlin adoption:\nThe pragmatic, productivity-focused Java Engineer: Experienced developers who see Java as a tool, not a religion. They’re always looking for better ways to get the job done faster.\nThe quality-minded, modern language enthusiast: Engineers who prioritize readable, concise, and maintainable code. These are often the same people who would have moved to Scala in the past.\nJunior Developers: Juniors who ask the simple but powerful question: “Why should I use Java if I can use Kotlin?” Without the baggage of years of Java experience, Kotlin is often a no-brainer for them.\nTo which group do you belong? \nThese early adopters ignite the first stage. But how do you start? Read on… ;-) \nThe Play Around Stage: Start Small – With Tests\nYou’ve heard about Kotlin and want to give it a try without committing to it immediately. \nSo the first thing you need is a developer tool where your very first Kotlin seeds can be planted. Here are some options:\nhttps://play.kotlinlang.org/ is a great online playground, simply type and run Kotlin code not only on the JVM but also for various other platforms (JS, WASM, etc.). \nKotlin Notebook is a powerful feature for IntelliJ IDEA that allows you to easily import dependencies, execute code, and even work with data, draw graphs, etc. Here is an example that shows how easy it is to do a REST call with Spring’s RestClient:\nIntelliJ IDEA has first-class support for Kotlin. This is no surprise, since JetBrains is the maker of Kotlin, and a large portion of IntelliJ IDEA is written in it. So, to start using Kotlin in IntelliJ IDEA – even in your existing Java project – is a breeze:\n\nFor Maven, simply configure the kotlin-maven-plugin and the Kotlin standard library kotlin-stdlib.\nFor Gradle, you configure the kotlin plugin.\n…and off you go!\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd there’s more! JetBrains recently released the Kotlin Language Server, bringing a full-featured Kotlin development experience to other IDEs beyond IntelliJ IDEA – such as VS Code. Check it out: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-lsp \nNow, you can write Kotlin in your favorite development environment. How can you evaluate the language in a real-world context with minimal impact and maximal insights? In the test suite of an existing Java project! \nThis safe and realistic approach to experimenting with Kotlin offers several advantages:\nLow Risk: Tests don’t affect production code.\nLearning Opportunity: You can explore the language features in a familiar context.\nGradual Introduction: Team members can get comfortable with Kotlin syntax without pressure.\nTips\nTry Kotest + MockK: to immediately feel the expressiveness of Kotlin’s testing DSLs (Domain-Specific Language), like the feature-rich assertions (shouldHaveSize(...), infix (value shouldBe 1), etc.\nUse the concise and powerful Kotlin Collections rather than Java Streams.\nPlay with various language features like Nullable types, destructuring, immutability (val, data classes), expression constructs (when, try-catch, if else), and many more.\nThis is what you get:\nJava\n@Test\nvoid shouldGetAverageRating() {\n   when(productRepository.findAll()).thenReturn(products);\n\n   Map<String, Double> ratings = productService.averageRatings();\n\n   assertAll(\n           () -> assertThat(ratings).hasSize(4),\n           () -> assertEquals(ratings, products\n                   .stream()\n                   .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(\n                           Product::getName,\n                           Collectors.flatMapping(\n                                   p -> p.getRatings()\n                                    .stream()\n                                    .mapToDouble(Integer::doubleValue)\n                                    .boxed(),   \n                              Collectors.averagingDouble(Double::doubleValue)\n                           )))\n           )\n   );\n   verify(productRepository).findAll();\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nKotlin\n@Test\nfun `should get average rating`() { //descriptive tests using ``\n   every { productRepository.findAll() } returns products\n\n   val ratings = productService.averageRatings()\n\n   assertSoftly(ratings) { \t\t//powerful testing DSLs (Kotest)\n       shouldHaveSize(4)\n       this shouldBe productRepository.findAll()\n           .groupBy { it.name }   \t\t\t//concise collections\n           .mapValues { (_, products) -> \t\t//destructuring\n                  products.flatMap { it.ratings }.average() }\n   }\n    verify { productRepository.findAll() }\n}\nNext in the series\nKotlin adoption usually starts with one person exploring and a few tests proving useful. Those first moments of discovery naturally lead to something larger: evaluating Kotlin in a real project.\nThe next post in this series will describe that stage and explain how to test Kotlin in production environments.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we’ve spent 25 years building tools for developers. Over the past two years, we’ve seen that AI isn’t just changing how developers write code – it’s beginning to reshape the entire process of product development.\nNot only is AI making developers more productive, helping with everything from code completion to testing and deployment, but we’re also seeing the rise of tools like Lovable, Replit, and Bolt, which enable people without coding skills to create simple apps. \nWhile these tools are great for building MVPs or quick prototypes, they hit a wall the moment you need multiple services, non-trivial business logic, or complex frontend operations. They’re built for solo creators, not teams working on production codebases.\nAt JetBrains, we believe great products still require teams. They depend on the work of product managers who understand the business, designers who craft great user experiences, and engineers who build solid architecture. They are built on collaboration, creative thinking, and the unique expertise and experience each role brings to the table.\nThat’s why we built Matter – an AI development companion for product teams working on complex codebases.\nToday, we’re opening the Early Access Program for Matter, and we would love for your team to check it out!\nAt this stage, Matter works with web-based projects only.\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nJoin the Matter EAP\n                                                    \nWhat is Matter?\nMatter is an AI-powered, cloud-based tool that allows your team to prototype and test new ideas directly in your existing codebase without writing code.\nIt enables real-time collaboration with teammates and live preview sharing – providing an experience similar to what you get with a design tool.\nMatter connects to your GitHub repository, where it provides an isolated environment for safe experimentation and allows you to see and share changes in real time. You can also create GitHub pull requests directly from its interface.\nHow it works:\nConnect your project\nLink Matter to your existing repository and get a live preview running in minutes. Everything happens in an isolated environment, so there’s no risk to your production code.\nInvite your teammates\nAdd your teammates, including product managers, designers, and developers, to the project, where you can all collaborate on prototypes.\nModify with Matter\nUse simple prompts like “Make this a single-page checkout“ or “Add a product review section“ to modify your app instantly. Matter’s AI agent handles the implementation so you don’t have to do any coding.\nSee changes instantly\nEvery change appears immediately in your live preview. Test interactions, click through flows, and see exactly how your ideas work in real-world implementations. \nCollaborate in real time\nSay goodbye to localhost:3000 – Matter lets you share working prototypes instantly with teammates and stakeholders. Whether you’re explaining ideas to decision-makers or validating ideas with customers, you get feedback in minutes with functional demos instead of static mockups.\nHand off what you built\nMatter integrates directly with GitHub and allows you to create a GitHub pull request from its interface. Used to a more traditional handoff? No problem – Matter can create an issue draft, generating both the code and the documentation for you.\nFor developers: Focus on what matters most\nDevelopers, what if your team’s designers could work on that “update button color” ticket themselves? What if the product manager could prototype the new checkout flow without pulling you into yet another alignment meeting?\nYou’d have more time for the things you enjoy the most – architectural decisions, performance optimizations, or other tasks that require deep engineering work.\nWith Matter, your non-technical teammates can work directly in the codebase. They can iterate on the UI, test interactions, and hand you a working prototype by creating a GitHub pull request. Everything happens in an isolated environment, so there’s no risk to your production code.\nThis changes the way you work, allowing you to:\nJoin design discussions earlier – When everyone works with actual code instead of specs and mockups, you can contribute to feature design from the start.\nReclaim your focus – No more P3 bug fixes for typos and padding tweaks. No more rebuilding Figma mockups from scratch. Designers iterate on the UI, while you focus on the architecture and complex challenges that require your expertise.\nShip faster, together – Tighter feedback loops mean faster iteration. When PMs and designers can validate ideas in hours, the whole team moves faster.\nThe best part? Your expertise remains essential, but is focused where it has the greatest impact.\nFor product managers and designers: Build independently\nYou’ve been designing in Figma, writing specs in Notion, and hoping developers interpret your vision correctly. Then comes the feedback: “This will take three sprints” or “We can’t do that with our current architecture”.\nWhat if you could test your ideas directly in the real codebase instead of just writing a spec?\nWith Matter, you can build functional prototypes and working features without having to do any coding.\nThis unlocks your ability to:\nShip faster – Speed up the time-to-market for new features and test product hypotheses faster.\nSpeak the same language – Hand off working prototypes simply by creating GitHub pull requests.\nMove independently – Make UI changes, fix copy, and adjust layouts without waiting for a developer’s calendar to open up.\nThe JetBrains way\nAt JetBrains, we’ve always believed in empowering people to do their best work. We build tools that enhance creativity and make the hard things easier.\nMatter is built on this same principle. We’re giving PMs and designers the ability to test ideas without creating bottlenecks for engineering. We’re giving developers the freedom to focus on the problems that most require their expertise. And we’re giving your business a more effective team thanks to a tighter feedback loop.\nWhether you’re a developer who wants to focus on complex problems, a designer who wants to see ideas come to life faster, or a PM who needs to validate hypotheses quickly, Matter gives you the tools to do your best work.\nJoin the Matter EAP",

        "pubDate": "Wed, 22 Oct 2025 11:29:44 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was written by an external contributor.\nMarcin Moskała\nMarcin is a highly experienced developer and Kotlin instructor, founder of Kt. Academy, an official JetBrains partner specializing in Kotlin training. He is also a Google Developers Expert and a well-known contributor to the Kotlin community. Marcin is the author of several widely recognized books, including Effective Kotlin, Kotlin Coroutines, Functional Kotlin, Advanced Kotlin, Kotlin Essentials, and Android Development with Kotlin.\nWebsite\nWhen it comes to writing short scripts or CRUDs, Python is a great choice. With its rich ecosystem and broad adoption, it can be easily used to scrape some data or to perform data analysis. However, maintaining a large codebase in Python can be very problematic.\nPython’s dynamic typing and mutable nature, while offering flexibility for rapid development, may present additional considerations in larger codebases. Event-loop-based coroutines can be tricky and may lead to subtle issues in practice . Finally, the single-threaded and dynamically typed nature of this language makes Python code significantly less efficient than most of its modern competitors. \nJVM is one of the fastest runtime platforms, making Java nearly as efficient as C. Most benchmarks show that Python code is 10 to 100 times slower than Java code. One big research paper compared the performance of multiple languages and showed that Python code is 74x more CPU-expensive than code in C, where Java code is only 1.8x more expensive. However, due to its long-standing commitment to backward compatibility, Java can feel verbose for certain tasks. Kotlin, building on that same ecosystem and offering the same efficiency, gives you access to a powerful typesystem, with modern language features focused on performance and developer ergonomics. \nThose are the key reasons we can hear from companies or teams that decide to switch from Python to Kotlin. The Kotlin YouTube channel recently published Wolt’s success story, but that is only one voice among many. Kotlin is an all-around sensible choice for a range of projects, as it shares many similarities with Python. At the same time, Kotlin offers better performance, safety, and a much more powerful concurrency model. Let’s see those similarities and differences in practice. \nSimilarities between Python and Kotlin\nWhen teaching Kotlin to both Python and Java developers, I was often surprised to discover that many Kotlin features are more frequently reported as intuitive by Python developers than their Java counterparts. Both languages offer concise syntax. Let’s compare some very simple use cases in both languages:\n\n\n\n\nval language = \"Kotlin\"\nprintln(\"Hello from $language\")\n// prints \"Hello from Kotlin\"\n\nval list = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\nfor (item in list) {\n  println(item)\n}\n// prints 1 2 3 4 5 each in a new line\n\nfun greet(name: String = \"Guest\") {\n  println(\"Hello, $name!\")\n}\ngreet() // prints \"Hello, Guest!\"\nlanguage = \"Python\"\nprint(f\"Hello from {language}\")\n# prints \"Hello from Python\"\n\nlist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nfor item in list:\n  print(item)\n# prints 1 2 3 4 5 each in a new line\n\ndef greet(name=\"Guest\"):\n  print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\ngreet()  # prints \"Hello, Guest!\"\nAt first glance, there are only minor syntactic differences. Kotlin presents features well-known to Python developers, like string interpolation, concise loops, and default parameters. However, even in this simple example, we can see some advantages that Kotlin has over Python. All properties are statistically typed, so language is of type String, and list is of type List<Int>. That not only allows for low-level optimizations, but it also brings enhanced safety and better IDE support. All variables in the code above are also defined as immutable, so we cannot accidentally change their values. To change them, we would need to use var instead of val. The same goes for the list I used in this snippet – it is immutable, so we cannot accidentally change its content. To create a mutable list, we would need to use mutableListOf and type it as MutableList<Int>. This strong distinction between mutable and immutable types is a great way to avoid accidental changes, which are often the source of bugs in Python programs.\nThere are other advantages of Kotlin over Python that are similarly apparent in the above example. Python’s default arguments are static, so changing them influences all future calls. This is a well-known source of very sneaky bugs in Python programs. Kotlin’s default arguments are evaluated at each call, so they are safer.\nKotlin\nfun test(list: MutableList<Int> = mutableListOf()) {\n  list.add(1)\n  println(list)\n}\ntest() // prints [1]\ntest() // prints [1]\ntest() // prints [1]\nPython\ndef test(list=[]):\n  list.append(1)\n  print(list)\n\ntest()  # prints [1]\ntest()  # prints [1, 1]\ntest()  # prints [1, 1, 1]\nLet’s talk about classes. Both languages support classes, inheritance, and interfaces. To compare them, let’s look at a simple data class in both languages:\nKotlin\ndata class Post(\n  val id: Int,\n  val content: String,\n  val publicationDate: LocalDate,\n  val author: String? = null\n)\nval post = Post(1, \"Hello, Kotlin!\", LocalDate.of(2024, 6, 1))\nprintln(post) // prints Post(id=1, content=Hello, Kotlin!, publicationDate=2024-06-01, author=null)\nPython\n@dataclass\nclass Post:\n  id: int\n  content: str\n  publication_date: date\n  author: Optional[str] = None\n    \npost = Post(1, \"Hello, Python!\", datetime.date(2024, 6, 1))\nprint(post)  # prints Post(id=1, content='Hello, Python!', publication_date=datetime.date(2024, 6, 1), author=null)\nKotlin has built-in support for data classes, which automatically allows such objects to be compared by value, destructured, and copied. Python requires an additional decorator to achieve similar functionality. This class is truly immutable in Kotlin, and thanks to static typing, it requires minimal memory. Outside of that, both implementations are very similar. Kotlin has built-in support for nullability, which in Python is expressed with the Optional type from the typing package.\nNow, let’s define a repository interface and its implementation in both languages. In Kotlin, we can use Spring Data with coroutine support, while in Python, we can use SQLAlchemy with async support. Notice that in Kotlin, there are two kinds of properties: Those defined inside a bracket are constructor parameters, while those defined within braces are class properties. So in SqlitePostRepository, crud is expected to be passed in the constructor. The framework we use will provide an instance of PostCrudRepository, which is generated automatically by Spring Data.\nKotlin\ninterface PostRepository {\n  suspend fun getPost(id: Int): Post?\n  suspend fun getPosts(): List<Post>\n  suspend fun savePost(content: String, author: String): Post\n}\n\n@Service\nclass SqlitePostRepository(\n  private val crud: PostCrudRepository\n) : PostRepository {\n  override suspend fun getPost(id: Int): Post? = crud.findById(id)\n\n  override suspend fun getPosts(): List<Post> = crud.findAll().toList()\n\n  override suspend fun savePost(content: String, author: String): Post =\n      crud.save(Post(content = content, author = author))\n}\n\n@Repository\ninterface PostCrudRepository : CoroutineCrudRepository<Post, Int>\n\n@Entity\ndata class Post(\n  @Id @GeneratedValue val id: Int? = null,\n  val content: String,\n  val publicationDate: LocalDate = LocalDate.now(),\n  val author: String\n)\nPython\nclass PostRepository(ABC):\n  @abstractmethod\n  async def get_post(self, post_id: int) -> Optional[Post]:\n      pass\n\n  @abstractmethod\n  async def get_posts(self) -> List[Post]:\n      pass\n\n  @abstractmethod\n  async def save_post(self, content: str, author: str) -> Post:\n      pass\n    \nclass SqlitePostRepository(PostRepository):\n  def __init__(self, session: AsyncSession):\n      self.session = session\n\n  async def get_post(self, post_id: int) -> Optional[Post]:\n      return await self.session.get(Post, post_id)  \n\n  async def get_posts(self) -> List[Post]:\n      result = await self.session.execute(select(Post))\n      return result.scalars().all()\n\n  async def save_post(self, content: str, author: str) -> Post:\n      post = Post(content=content, author=author)\n      self.session.add(post)\n      await self.session.commit()\n      await self.session.refresh(post)\n      return post\n\nclass Post(Base):\n  __tablename__ = \"posts\"\n  id: Mapped[int] = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)\n  content: Mapped[str] = Column(String)\n  publication_date: Mapped[date] = Column(Date, default=date.today)\n  author: Mapped[str] = Column(String)\nThose implementations are very similar in many ways, and the key differences between them result from choices made by the frameworks, not the languages themselves. Python, due to its dynamic nature, encourages the use of untyped objects or dictionaries; however, such practices are generally discouraged in modern times. Both languages provide numerous tools for libraries to design effective APIs. On the JVM, these languages often depend on annotation processing, whereas in Python, decorators are more common. Kotlin leverages a mature and well-developed Spring Boot ecosystem, but it also offers lightweight alternatives such as Ktor or Micronaut. Python has Flask and FastAPI as popular lightweight frameworks, and Django as a more heavyweight framework.\nIn a backend application, we also need to implement services, which are classes that implement business logic. They often do some collection or string processing. Kotlin provides a comprehensive standard library with numerous useful functions for processing collections and strings. All those functions are named and called in a very consistent way. In Python, we can make nearly all transformations available in Kotlin, but to do so, we need to use many different kinds of constructs. In the code below, I needed to use top-level functions, methods on lists, collection comprehensions, or even classes from the collections package. Those constructs are not very consistent, some of them are not very convenient, and are not easily discoverable. You can also see that complicated notation for defining lambda expressions in Python harms collection processing APIs. Collection and string processing in Kotlin is much more pleasant and productive.\nKotlin\nclass PostService(\n  private val repository: PostRepository\n) {\n  suspend fun getPostsByAuthor(author: String): List<Post> =\n      repository.getPosts()\n          .filter { it.author == author }\n          .sortedByDescending { it.publicationDate }\n\n  suspend fun getAuthorsWithPostCount(): Map<String?, Int> =\n      repository.getPosts()\n          .groupingBy { it.author }\n          .eachCount()\n\n  suspend fun getAuthorsReport(): String =\n      getAuthorsWithPostCount()\n          .toList()\n          .sortedByDescending { (_, count) -> count }\n          .joinToString(separator = \"n\") { (author, count) ->\n              val author = author ?: \"Unknown\"\n              \"$author: $count posts\"\n          }\n          .let { \"Authors Report:n$it\" }\n}\nPython\nclass PostService:\n  def __init__(self, repository: \"PostRepository\") -> None:\n      self.repository = repository\n\n  async def get_posts_by_author(self, author: str) -> List[Post]:\n      posts = await self.repository.get_posts()\n      filtered = [post for post in posts if post.author == author]\n      sorted_posts = sorted(\n          filtered,\n          key=lambda p: p.publication_date,\n          reverse=True\n      )\n      return sorted_posts\n\n  async def get_authors_with_post_count(self) -> Dict[Optional[str], int]:\n      posts = await self.repository.get_posts()\n      counts = Counter(p.author for p in posts)\n      return dict(counts)\n\n  async def get_authors_report(self) -> str:\n      counts = await self.get_authors_with_post_count()\n      items = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse=True)\n      lines = [\n          f\"{(author if author is not None else 'Unknown')}: {count} posts\"\n          for author, count in items\n      ]\n      return \"Authors Report:n\" + \"n\".join(lines)\nBefore we finish our comparison, let’s complete our example backend application by defining a controller that exposes our service through HTTP. Until now, I have used Spring Boot, which is the most popular framework for Kotlin backend development. This is how it can be used to define a controller:\nKotlin\n@Controller\n@RequestMapping(\"/posts\")\nclass PostController(\n   private val service: PostService\n) {\n   @GetMapping(\"/{id}\")\n   suspend fun getPost(@PathVariable id: Int): ResponseEntity<Post> {\n       val post = service.getPost(id)\n       return if (post != null) {\n           ResponseEntity.ok(post)\n       } else {\n           ResponseEntity.notFound().build()\n       }\n   }\n\n   @GetMapping\n   suspend fun getPostsByAuthor(@RequestParam author: String): List<Post> =\n       service.getPostsByAuthor(author)\n\n   @GetMapping(\"/authors/report\")\n   suspend fun getAuthorsReport(): String =\n       service.getAuthorsReport()\n}\nHowever, we noticed that many Python developers prefer a lighter and simpler framework, and their preferred choice for such functionality is Ktor. Ktor allows users to define a working application in just a couple of lines of code. This is a complete Ktor Server application that implements a simple in-memory text storage (it requires no other configuration or dependencies except Ktor itself):\nKotlin\nfun main() = embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {\n   routing {\n       var value = \"\"\n       get(\"/text\") {\n           call.respondText(value)\n       }\n       post(\"/text\") {\n           value = call.receiveText()\n           call.respond(HttpStatusCode.OK)\n       }\n   }\n}.start(wait = true)\n\n\n\n\nI hope that this comparison helped you see both the key similarities and differences between Python and Kotlin. As we’ve seen, Kotlin has many features that are very intuitive for Python developers. At the same time, Kotlin offers many improvements over Python, especially in terms of safety. It has a powerful static type system that prevents many common bugs, built-in support for immutability, and a very rich and consistent standard library.\nTo summarize, I believe it’s fair to say that both languages are very similar in many ways, but Kotlin brings a number of improvements – some small, some big. In addition, Kotlin offers some unique features that are not present in Python, the biggest one probably being a concurrency model based on coroutines.\nkotlinx.coroutines vs. Python asyncio\nThe most modern approach to concurrency in Kotlin and Python is based on coroutines. In Python, the most popular library for this purpose is asyncio, while in Kotlin, there is the Kotlin kotlinx.coroutines library. Both libraries can start lightweight asynchronous tasks and await their completion. However, there are some important differences between them.\nLet’s start with the hallmark feature of kotlinx.coroutines: first-class support for structured concurrency. Let’s say that you implement a service like SkyScanner, which searches for the best flight offers. Now, let’s suppose a user makes a search, which results in a request or the opening of a WebSocket connection to our service. Our service needs to query multiple airlines to return the best offers. Let’s then suppose that this user left our page soon after searching. All those requests to airlines are now useless and likely very costly, because we have a limited number of ports available to make requests. However, implementing explicit cancellation of all those requests is very hard. Structured concurrency solves that problem. With kotlinx.coroutines, every coroutine started by a coroutine is its child, and when the parent coroutine is cancelled, all its children are cancelled too. This way, our cancellation is automatic and reliable.\nOnce the user leaves the screen, all processes and ports get cancelled. For the above graphic, I used the free icons Close eyes by Iconic Panda and Landing page by Design Circle\n\n\n\nHowever, structured concurrency goes even further. If getting a resource requires loading two other resources asynchronously, an exception in one of those two resources will cancel the other one too. This way, kotlinx.coroutines ensures that we use our resources in the most efficient way. In Python, asyncio introduced TaskGroup in version 3.11, which offers some support for structured concurrency, but it is far from what kotlinx.coroutines offer, and it requires explicit usage.\nKotlin\nsuspend fun fetchUser(): UserData = coroutineScope {\n  // fetchUserDetails is cancelled if fetchPosts fails\n  val userDetails = async { api.fetchUserDetails() }\n  // fetchPosts is cancelled if fetchUserDetails fails\n  val posts = async { api.fetchPosts() }\n  UserData(userDetails.await(), posts.await())\n}\nThe second important difference is thread management. In Python, asyncio runs all tasks on a single thread. Notice that this is not utilizing the power of multiple CPU cores, and it is not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks. Using kotlinx.coroutines, coroutines can typically run on a thread pool (by default as big as the number of CPU cores). This way, coroutines better utilize the power of modern hardware. Of course, coroutines can also run on a single thread if needed, which is quite common in client applications.\nAnother big advantage of coroutines is their testing capabilities. kotlinx.coroutines provides built-in support for testing asynchronous code over a predetermined simulated timeframe, removing the need to wait while the code is tested in real time. This way, we can test asynchronous code in a deterministic way, without any flakiness. We can also easily simulate all kinds of scenarios, like different delays from dependent services. In Python, testing asynchronous code is possible using third-party libraries, but this method is not as powerful and convenient as with coroutines.\nKotlin\n@Test\nfun `should fetch data asynchronously`() = runTest {\n  val api = mockk<Api> {\n      coEvery { fetchUserDetails() } coAnswers {\n          delay(1000)\n          UserDetails(\"John Doe\")\n      }\n      coEvery { fetchPosts() } coAnswers {\n          delay(1000)\n          listOf(Post(\"Hello, world!\"))\n      }\n  }\n  val useCase = FetchUserDataUseCase(api)\n  val userData = useCase.fetchUser()\n  assertEquals(\"John Doe\", userData.user.name)\n  assertEquals(\"Hello, world!\", userData.posts.single().title)\n  assertEquals(1000, currentTime)\n}\nFinally, kotlinx.coroutines offer powerful support for reactive streams through the Flow type. It is perfect for representing websockets or streams of events. Flow processing can be easily transformed using operators consistent with collection processing. It also supports backpressure, which is essential for building robust systems. Python has async generators, which can be used to represent streams of data, but they are not as powerful and convenient as Flow.\nKotlin\nfun notificationStatusFlow(): Flow<NotificationStatus> =\n  notificationProvider.observeNotificationUpdate()\n      .distinctUntilChanged()\n      .scan(NotificationStatus()) { status, update ->\n          status.applyNotification(update)\n      }\n      .combine(\n          userStateProvider.userStateFlow()\n      ) { status, user ->\n          statusFactory.produce(status, user)\n      }\nPerformance comparison\nOne of the key benefits of switching from Python to Kotlin is performance. Python applications can be fast when they use optimized native libraries, but Python itself is not the fastest language. As a statically typed language, Kotlin can be compiled to optimized bytecode that runs on the JVM platform, which is a highly optimized runtime. In consequence, Kotlin applications are typically faster than Python applications.\nBenchmark comparing different languages performing the same nested loop iterations made by Ben Dicken and published on https://benjdd.com/languages/.\n\n\n\nBenchmark comparing different languages performing the same Naive Fibonacci calculation made by Ben Dicken and published on https://benjdd.com/languages/.\n\n\n\nKotlin applications also use fewer resources. One reason for this is Kotlin’s more efficient memory management (a consequence of static typing). Another reason is structured concurrency, which ensures that resources are cancelled when they are no longer needed. \nInteroperability\nKotlin is fully interoperable with Java. This means that Kotlin applications can use everything from the rich Java ecosystem. Everything that can be used in Java can easily be used in Kotlin as well (see interoperability guide). \nIt is also possible to bridge between Kotlin and Python using libraries like JPype or Py4J. Nowadays, some libraries support further interoperability, like zodable, which allows generating Zod schemas from Kotlin data classes.\nSummary\nI love Kotlin and I love Python. I’ve used both languages extensively throughout my career. In the past, Python had many clear advantages over Kotlin, such as a richer ecosystem, more libraries, and scripting capabilities. In some domains, like artificial intelligence, I still find Python to be a better choice. However, for backend development, Kotlin is clearly the better option today. It offers similar conciseness and ease of use as Python, but it is faster, safer, and scales better. If you consider switching from Python to Kotlin for your backend development, it is a transition worth making.\n.enlighter-l-kotlin {\n    background: #fff !important;\n}\nbody .is-layout-flex {\n    align-items: flex-start;\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);\n}\nbody .is-layout-flex>div {\n    height: 100%;\n}\nbody .is-layout-flex>div>div {\n    height: 100%;\n}\n\n@media (max-width: 1024px){\n\tbody .is-layout-flex {\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t}\n}",

You end up rewriting instructions, tweaking them constantly, and hoping the model stays on track. It gives Copilot a visible, structured path to follow, one that updates as it works and keeps you in control at every step.\nIn Agent Mode, Copilot can now create plans that research your codebase, break down big tasks, and run them step by step while iterating along the way. The result is a more predictable and transparent workflow that helps you understand exactly what it’s doing.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\n\n\n   Now available: Planning in Chat is in public preview in Visual Studio 2022 17.14. We’re rolling this out gradually, so you might already have it enabled. If not, you can turn it on via Tools > Options > Copilot > Enable Planning. \n\nHow It Works\nPlanning uses transparent tool calls to manage complex tasks in a structured way.\nWhen you ask Copilot to handle a multi-step task, it automatically determines whether to respond directly or switch into built in planning. Simple prompts get quick answers, while multi-step ones trigger a coordinated plan. When invoked, Planning creates a markdown file that defines the task, research steps, and progress updates as each execution begins. As Copilot works, it revises and refines the plan — adapting to new context or results.\nA few details to keep in mind:\nThe plan is written to a temporary file (%TEMP%\\VisualStudio\\copilot-vs\\). To reuse it across threads, add it to your repo. If you want longer-term storage options, upvote this request. \nIf you edit the plan while a response is running, changes may not take effect immediately. Stop the response, update the file or prompt, and restart it. We’re exploring ways to make mid-response edits smoother. Upvote this idea -> if you’d like to see it sooner.\nProgress is tracked directly in the plan file, so you can always see what’s completed and what’s next.\nHow Planning Impacts Response Quality\nPlanning makes Copilot more predictable and consistent by giving it a structured way to reason about your project. It builds on techniques from hierarchical and closed-loop planning research – enabling Copilot to plan at a high level, execute step-by-step, and adjust dynamically as it learns more about your codebase and issues encountered during implementation.\nIn our latest SWE-bench runs, both GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet 4 performed better with planning, around 15% higher success and 20% more tasks resolved and we’re continuing to test additional models to confirm the trend.\nThese early results show measurable gains in reliability and task completion, especially for larger, multi-step problems.\nWhat’s Next\nWe’re actively collecting feedback as we evolve Copilot’s planning system to better fit your workflow. This marks the foundation of planning-driven development in Visual Studio. Upcoming improvements will focus on smarter caching, refined reasoning, and deeper project context. It’s an early milestone – but one we believe will make Copilot a more predictable and transparent collaborator. Share your feedback here: Planning/To dos in Copilot Chat.\nThis remains a preview feature as we continue refining the planning format, expanding tests across newer models, and validating how these structured plans evolve alongside model improvements.\n\n \nThe post Introducing Planning in Visual Studio (Public Preview) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We have great news for extension users and developers: Visual Studio 2026 is introducing an extension compatibility model designed specifically to make your life easier. Our top priority is to ensure that your extensions continue to work seamlessly across Visual Studio releases – with no extra effort required from you. For users: extensions that work in Visual Studio 2022 will just automatically work in Visual Studio 2026. And when upgrading to Visual Studio 2026 the Installer will install most extensions you’re using in Visual Studio 2022.\nFor extension developers, gone are the days of needing to update version ranges or addressing broad sweeping compatibility issues with every major update. With this new model, your existing extension just works in Visual Studio 2026 – no need to publish updates! By raising the compatibility bar and stabilizing the extension environment, we are removing the friction from your update process and giving you the confidence that your users can rely on your extension, release after release. And for those of you who rely on extensions to get your work done, you can rest assured that your favorite extensions will continue to function smoothly with Visual Studio 2026.\nThe rest of this post will offer in-depth guidance for extension developers.\nPrinciples of a modern extension compatibility model\nIf you are an experienced developer in the Visual Studio ecosystem, you’re probably well-acquainted with vsixmanifest files and managing the version ranges in installation targets. Traditionally, each major release of Visual Studio meant updating the upper bound of your supported version range and checking for potential compatibility issues. However, with Visual Studio 2026, this routine has changed – extensions built for Visual Studio 2022 have transferred seamlessly to Visual Studio 2026 without any modifications required.\nThe new extension compatibility model for Visual Studio is guided by three core principles:\nExtensions specify the API versions they are built against. Visual Studio evaluates which API versions are supported at load time and only loads extensions compatible with those versions. This represents a shift from the previous approach, where extensions indicated the Visual Studio versions they supported. We understand that there are many parts to what make up the full API set for extending Visual Studio, and we are working on providing a clearer picture going forward.\nThe Visual Studio platform aims to minimize or eliminate breaking changes to stable APIs. We understand that Visual Studio 2022 was a disruptive transition for many extension authors with our shift from 32 to 64 bit. Going forward, we commit to a smoother and more streamlined migration process.\nAdditive changes will undergo an iterative process prior to being released as stable. As new features are introduced, we will add new APIs to extend these features. However, new APIs require a period of iteration during which modifications and potential breaks may occur. Preview APIs will be made available for evaluation, but extenders should refrain from using them in production extensions due to the possibility of breaking changes.\nImpact to Visual Studio 2026 extensions\nWhat does this mean for Visual Studio 2026? Simply put, if you have a Visual Studio 2022 extension, you don’t need to modify it for compatibility with Visual Studio 2026. This is because Visual Studio 2026 supports API version 17.x, and we determine API compatibility using only the lower bound of the installation target version range – ignoring the upper bound from now on. The following example demonstrates an extension that works with Visual Studio 2022, and no updates are necessary if this describes your situation.\n<InstallationTarget Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community\" Version=\"[17.0, 18.0)\">\nIf you use Visual Studio 2026 to create new extensions, you’ll notice that the lower bound will be automatically set to 17.0, with the upper bound left empty, as demonstrated in the example below.\n<InstallationTarget Id=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community\" Version=\"[17.0,)\">\nThis means that any new extensions created will now automatically target both Visual Studio 2022 and Visual Studio 2026!\nDespite the easy migration process, we still recommend that extenders test their extensions on Visual Studio 2026 to catch any compatibility bugs. If you find an issue is likely caused by the platform, please file a feedback ticket using Report a Problem.\nThe smooth migration process for getting extensions in Visual Studio only applies to VSIX-based extensions. Developers who maintain MSI-based extensions are responsible for managing how users install them, and these MSI installers would need to adapt to this updated approach. Our general recommendation is that extension authors do not create MSI installers and just use VSIX to distribute their extensions.\nWhat’s next?\nAre you wondering about new APIs that will support extending new features in Visual Studio 2026? These are part of the ongoing additive changes, and we’re not ready to release them yet because we are still refining their design. Once they are ready, we’ll make them available as preview packages first, allowing interested developers to test them and share feedback. Keep in mind that extensions built with these preview APIs cannot be uploaded to the Marketplace, since breaking changes are likely to impact extension users.\nAs Visual Studio keeps evolving, we are updating every part of extensibility to meet the needs of both extension developers and users. This includes new APIs in VisualStudio.Extensibility, improvements in extension build tooling, Marketplace enhancements, and easier extension acquisition. We’ll share more updates as development progresses.\nWe want to hear from you!\nThank you for sharing your issues and suggestions with us, and we hope you’ll keep providing feedback about what you like and what we can improve in Visual Studio. We understand this is a shift in how to think about extension compatibility in Visual Studio, so we are providing an opportunity for interested extension developers to engage with us directly through ecosystem partner calls. If you are interested, please fill out this survey to get on the list.\nFor those new and experienced to extending Visual Studio, we invite you to visit our documentation to learn more, or watch the video series on Visual Studio Toolbox where Visual Studio engineers take you through how to build extensions using our samples on GitHub. Feel free to share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones. If you want a closer engagement with other partners in the ecosystem, please visit our GitHub repo to report issues as well.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn.\nThe post Modernizing Visual Studio Extension Compatibility: Effortless Migration for Extension Developers and Users appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

AI의 똑똑한 역할 분담!</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">자, 그런데 여기서 정말 궁금한 점이 생길 거예요. \"이 앱은 대체 어떤 원리로 작동하는 걸까?\" 특히, \"보통 AI가 만든 이미지에는 일관성이 없고 한글이 깨지거나 이상하게 나오는데, 여기서는 어떻게 이렇게 완벽한 만화를 만드는 거지?\" 이런 의문이 드는 게 당연합니다. 이제 그 비밀을 하나씩 풀어드릴게요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>1. AI 대본 생성의 비밀: 체계적인 지시와 양식</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">여러분이 \"회사 회의\"라는 주제를 입력하면, 앱은 단순히 \"만화 대본 써줘\"라고 요청하는 게 아니에요. 마치 아주 꼼꼼한 주문서처럼, AI에게 매우 자세한 지침을 함께 보냅니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"개그 만화를 선택하셨네요? 그럼 1번 컷은 평범한 일상, 2~3번 컷은 상황 전개, 마지막 4번 컷은 웃긴 반전으로 끝내세요\"와 같이 구체적으로 지시하는 식이죠. 그리고 가장 중요한 것은, AI의 답변을 <b>정리된 형식</b>으로 받는다는 겁니다. 마치 학교 과제를 제출할 때 '이름은 여기, 학번은 여기, 내용은 여기'처럼 정해진 양식이 있듯이, '캐릭터 이름은 여기, 대사는 여기, 장면 설명은 여기'라고 미리 칸을 만들어두는 거죠. 이렇게 하면 컴퓨터가 AI의 답변을 정확히 이해하고, 다음 단계로 오류 없이 넘어갈 수 있게 됩니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>2. 캐릭터 일관성의 비밀: '캐릭터 시트'의 힘</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">일반적으로 AI에게 그림을 그려달라고 할 때, \"안경 쓴 남자\"라고 말로만 설명하면 AI가 상상해서 그리기 때문에 매번 조금씩 다른 사람이 나오기 마련입니다. 하지만 이 앱은 이 문제를 아주 영리하게 해결했어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">먼저 캐릭터의 모습을 한 번 그린 다음, 이를 <b>'캐릭터 시트'</b>로 만듭니다. 이 캐릭터 시트는 마치 신분증 사진처럼 캐릭터의 기준이 되는 이미지를 정면에서 찍은 것이라고 생각하시면 돼요. 그리고 각 컷을 그릴 때는, AI에게 이 캐릭터 시트를 함께 보여주면서 \"이 사람이랑 똑같이 생긴 캐릭터를 그려줘\"라고 요청하는 거죠. 마치 화가에게 모델 사진을 주고 \"이 사람을 그려주세요\"라고 하는 것과 같은 원리입니다. 그렇기 때문에 4개의 컷 모두에서 동일한 캐릭터가 일관성 있게 등장할 수 있는 거예요! 정말 똑똑하죠?</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>3. 한글 렌더링의 비밀: AI는 그림만, 브라우저는 텍스트를!</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">자, 이제 가장 신기한 부분입니다. 한글이 어떻게 그렇게 깨끗하게 나올 수 있을까요? 정답은 의외로 간단해요. <b>AI에게 한글을 그리라고 시키지 않았거든요!</b></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI는 오직 배경과 캐릭터의 표정, 동작만 그립니다. 말풍선이나 대사는 전혀 그리지 않아요. 오직 완전히 깨끗한 그림만 만들어내는 거죠. 그럼 말풍선과 대사는 누가 만들까요? 바로 여러분의 <b>웹 브라우저</b>입니다! AI가 깨끗한 그림을 넘겨주면, 브라우저가 그 위에 말풍선을 그리고, 한글 대사를 얹어주는 방식이에요. 마치 여러분이 지금 보고 있는 이 블로그 글이나 영상 자막처럼, 시스템 폰트를 사용해서 깨끗하고 선명하게 표시하는 원리인 거죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 방법의 장점은 한글뿐만 아니라 일본어, 중국어 등 어떤 언어든 완벽하게 표시될 수 있다는 점입니다. 게다가 말풍선의 모양이나 위치도 사용자가 자유롭게 바꿀 수 있다는 엄청난 유연성을 제공하죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론적으로, 이 앱의 핵심 비밀은 <b>\"역할 분담\"</b>에 있습니다. AI는 창의적이고 복잡한 그림을 그리는 일에 집중하고, 정확하고 안정적인 텍스트 표시는 웹 브라우저가 맡는 거죠. 각자 가장 잘하는 일만 하니까 이렇게 완벽하고 효율적인 결과물이 나올 수 있는 겁니다!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">[결과물 예시]</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

AI 기반 대본 생성 기능\n여러분은 그저 간단한 주제만 입력하면 됩니다. 그러면 AI가 자동으로 네컷 만화에 최적화된 완벽한 대본을 작성해줍니다. 캐릭터의 세부 설정부터 각 컷의 장면 묘사, 그리고 대사까지, 모든 것을 포함하는 완성된 시나리오를 받을 수 있죠. 덕분에 스토리 구성에 대한 부담을 확 덜 수 있어요.\n2. 독보적인 캐릭터 일관성 유지 기능\n이 기능은 정말 핵심적이고 놀라운 부분이에요! 기존의 AI 이미지 생성 서비스들을 사용해 보셨다면 아실 거예요. 매번 그림을 그릴 때마다 캐릭터의 모습이 미묘하게, 혹은 완전히 달라지는 문제가 발생했죠. 하지만 이 앱은 '캐릭터 시트'라는 것을 먼저 생성해서, 만화의 모든 컷에서 동일한 캐릭터가 일관성 있게 등장하도록 만들어줍니다. 마치 실제 웹툰 작가들이 캐릭터 설정을 통해 작업하는 방식과 흡사하죠.\n3. 다채로운 그림 스타일 지원\n만들고 싶은 만화의 분위기에 맞춰 다양한 그림 스타일을 선택할 수 있다는 것도 큰 장점입니다. 90년대 감성을 자극하는 명랑만화 스타일부터, 마블 코믹스처럼 역동적인 아메리칸 코믹스, 요즘 인기를 끄는 세련된 한국 최신 웹툰 스타일, 그리고 고풍스러운 유럽 클래식 만화 스타일까지. 원하는 스타일을 선택해서 나만의 개성을 담을 수 있어요.\n4. 완벽한 한글 렌더링\n보통 AI가 그린 이미지에는 한글이 깨지거나 의미를 알 수 없게 나오는 경우가 많아 불편함을 느꼈을 텐데요. 이 앱은 특별한 원리를 사용해서 한글 대사가 완벽하게, 그리고 아주 깔끔하게 표현됩니다. 이 부분이 정말 중요한데요, 뒤에서 이 신기한 원리에 대해 자세히 설명해 드릴게요.\n5. 인스타그램 포스팅 지원 기능\n만화가 완성되면 다양한 형태로 다운로드할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 인스타그램 같은 소셜미디어에 바로 올릴 수 있도록 매력적인 설명글과 관련 해시태그까지 자동으로 생성해줍니다. 이제 콘텐츠 제작부터 홍보까지, 모든 과정을 앱 하나로 끝낼 수 있게 된 거죠. 마케팅 콘텐츠로 활용하기에도 정말 유용하겠다는 생각이 들어요.\n  직접 사용해 봤습니다! 네컷 만능 만화 생성기 사용법\n그럼 이제 실제로 '네컷 만능 만화 생성기' 앱을 어떻게 사용하는지, 제가 직접 따라가 본 과정을 화면을 보면서 함께 설명해 드릴게요. 정말 간단하답니다!\n1. 브라우저 접속 및 초기 화면 확인\n먼저 웹 브라우저를 열어 앱 주소로 접속하면, 깔끔하고 직관적인 메인 화면이 나타납니다. 화면 상단에는 '주제 선정 → 대본 확인 → 등장인물 확인 → 만화 생성' 이렇게 4단계 진행 표시가 보이는데, 이 단계만 잘 따라가면 여러분의 만화가 완성됩니다.\n2. 그림 스타일 선택\n첫 번째 단계는 그림 스타일을 선택하는 것입니다. 드롭다운 메뉴를 클릭하면 네 가지 스타일이 나타나는데, 각 스타일의 특징을 잘 이해하고 선택하는 것이 중요해요.\n명랑만화: 90년대 감성의 귀엽고 코믹한 스타일로, 2등신에서 3등신 정도의 깜찍한 캐릭터가 특징이에요. 유머러스한 이야기를 만들 때 잘 어울리죠\n\n\n\n아메리칸 코믹스: 마블이나 DC 코믹스처럼 역동적이고 히어로적인 분위기를 낼 때 적합합니다. 강렬한 액션이나 판타지 장르에 도전하고 싶다면 추천해요.\n\n\n\n한국 최신 웹툰: 요즘 네이버나 카카오 웹툰에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 세련되고 감성적인 스타일입니다. 일상 드라마나 로맨스 장르에 최적화되어 있어요.\n\n\n\n복고풍 만화: 유럽의 클래식한 '라인 클레어' 스타일로, 고전적인 느낌의 이야기를 표현하고 싶을 때 좋습니다.\n\n\nTip: 선택한 스타일이 만화 전체의 분위기를 결정하니, 만들고 싶은 만화의 컨셉을 먼저 떠올린 후 그에 맞는 스타일을 신중하게 선택하는 것이 좋습니다.\n3. 텍스트 박스 디자인 및 장르, 만화 형식 선택\n그림 스타일을 골랐다면, 이제 텍스트 박스 디자인을 선택합니다. 만화의 대사가 들어갈 말풍선 형태나 전체 나레이션처럼 보이는 텍스트 박스 중 하나를 고를 수 있어요.\n다음으로는 장르를 선택해야 합니다. 시사 풍자 만화, 일상 공감 및 개그 만화, 자기계발 등 다양한 장르가 준비되어 있어요. 각 장르마다 AI가 대본을 작성할 때 그 장르의 고유한 특징을 살려서 글을 써줍니다. 예를 들어, '일상 공감 및 개그 만화'를 선택하면 마지막 컷에 웃음이나 공감 포인트를 넣어주고, '자기계발'을 선택하면 긍정적인 메시지와 용기를 주는 내용으로 흐름을 잡죠.\n마지막으로 만화 형식을 선택합니다. 네컷 만화로 끝낼지, 아니면 여러 편의 연속 만화로 만들지를 선택할 수 있어요. 이 설정은 AI가 대본을 생성하는 데 중요한 참고 자료가 됩니다.\n4. 주제 입력 또는 AI 아이디어 활용\n이제 가장 중요한 단계인 주제 입력 시간입니다. 만화로 만들고 싶은 내용을 주제 입력창에 간단히 입력하면 됩니다. 예를 들어, \"요즘 배달비가 너무 비싸\"처럼 짧게 입력해도 되고, \"재택근무하면서 집에서 운동 안 하게 되는 이야기\"처럼 좀 더 구체적으로 작성해도 좋아요. 아니면 아예 전체 스크립트를 직접 입력해도 됩니다.\n만약 마땅한 주제가 생각나지 않으시더라도 걱정 마세요! 오른쪽 상단의 전구  모양 아이콘을 클릭하면 AI가 선택한 장르에 딱 맞는 창의적인 아이디어 5개를 추천해줍니다. 마음에 드는 아이디어를 클릭하면 자동으로 주제 입력창에 들어가니, 정말 편리하죠. 주제가 결정되었다면 바로 '대본 생성하기' 버튼을 눌러주세요.\n5. 대본 및 캐릭터 확인 & 만화 생성\n대본 생성하기 버튼을 누르면, 등장인물 정보와 상세 대본이 출력됩니다. 여기서 등장인물 이름이나 대사를 수정할 수 있는데, 이 수정 내용은 만화 생성 시 그대로 반영됩니다. 모든 것이 마음에 든다면 '캐릭터 생성하기'를 클릭하세요. 대본에 맞춰 2명의 캐릭터 설정이 완료되면, '만화 생성하러 가기' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n바로 4개의 만화 패널이 눈앞에 펼쳐집니다! 각 패널에는 번호와 대사가 표시되어 있고, 중앙에는 '이미지 생성' 버튼이 있죠. 여기서 한 컷씩 천천히 확인하며 이미지를 만들 수도 있고, '모든 이미지 한 번에 생성' 버튼으로 4개 이미지를 동시에 생성할 수도 있습니다.\n\n\n만약 말풍선을 선택했다면, 마우스 왼쪽 버튼으로 말풍선의 크기, 위치, 회전, 꼬리 등을 자유롭게 조정할 수 있습니다. 마우스 오른쪽 버튼을 클릭하면 말풍선 형태나 외곽선 색상까지 변경할 수 있어요. 처음에는 조금 연습이 필요할 수 있지만, 말풍선 가장자리의 노란색 점에 마우스를 가져가 커서가 손 모양으로 바뀌는 순간을 놓치지 않으면 쉽게 수정할 수 있습니다!\n만화 생성이 완료되면 바둑판 형태, 가로 및 세로 형태, 개별 저장 등 다양한 옵션으로 저장할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로 '인스타그램 포스트 추천' 섹션에서 AI가 생성해 준 설명글과 해시태그를 확인하고 바로 SNS에 공유해 보세요!\n  그림 못 그려도 웹툰 작가 되는 비결? AI의 똑똑한 역할 분담!\n자, 그런데 여기서 정말 궁금한 점이 생길 거예요. \"이 앱은 대체 어떤 원리로 작동하는 걸까?\" 특히, \"보통 AI가 만든 이미지에는 일관성이 없고 한글이 깨지거나 이상하게 나오는데, 여기서는 어떻게 이렇게 완벽한 만화를 만드는 거지?\" 이런 의문이 드는 게 당연합니다. 이제 그 비밀을 하나씩 풀어드릴게요.\n1. AI 대본 생성의 비밀: 체계적인 지시와 양식\n여러분이 \"회사 회의\"라는 주제를 입력하면, 앱은 단순히 \"만화 대본 써줘\"라고 요청하는 게 아니에요. 마치 아주 꼼꼼한 주문서처럼, AI에게 매우 자세한 지침을 함께 보냅니다.\n예를 들어, \"개그 만화를 선택하셨네요? 그럼 1번 컷은 평범한 일상, 2~3번 컷은 상황 전개, 마지막 4번 컷은 웃긴 반전으로 끝내세요\"와 같이 구체적으로 지시하는 식이죠. 그리고 가장 중요한 것은, AI의 답변을 정리된 형식으로 받는다는 겁니다. 마치 학교 과제를 제출할 때 '이름은 여기, 학번은 여기, 내용은 여기'처럼 정해진 양식이 있듯이, '캐릭터 이름은 여기, 대사는 여기, 장면 설명은 여기'라고 미리 칸을 만들어두는 거죠. 이렇게 하면 컴퓨터가 AI의 답변을 정확히 이해하고, 다음 단계로 오류 없이 넘어갈 수 있게 됩니다.\n2. 캐릭터 일관성의 비밀: '캐릭터 시트'의 힘\n일반적으로 AI에게 그림을 그려달라고 할 때, \"안경 쓴 남자\"라고 말로만 설명하면 AI가 상상해서 그리기 때문에 매번 조금씩 다른 사람이 나오기 마련입니다. 하지만 이 앱은 이 문제를 아주 영리하게 해결했어요.\n먼저 캐릭터의 모습을 한 번 그린 다음, 이를 '캐릭터 시트'로 만듭니다. 이 캐릭터 시트는 마치 신분증 사진처럼 캐릭터의 기준이 되는 이미지를 정면에서 찍은 것이라고 생각하시면 돼요. 그리고 각 컷을 그릴 때는, AI에게 이 캐릭터 시트를 함께 보여주면서 \"이 사람이랑 똑같이 생긴 캐릭터를 그려줘\"라고 요청하는 거죠. 마치 화가에게 모델 사진을 주고 \"이 사람을 그려주세요\"라고 하는 것과 같은 원리입니다. 그렇기 때문에 4개의 컷 모두에서 동일한 캐릭터가 일관성 있게 등장할 수 있는 거예요! 정말 똑똑하죠?\n3. 한글 렌더링의 비밀: AI는 그림만, 브라우저는 텍스트를!\n자, 이제 가장 신기한 부분입니다. 한글이 어떻게 그렇게 깨끗하게 나올 수 있을까요? 정답은 의외로 간단해요. AI에게 한글을 그리라고 시키지 않았거든요!\nAI는 오직 배경과 캐릭터의 표정, 동작만 그립니다. 말풍선이나 대사는 전혀 그리지 않아요. 오직 완전히 깨끗한 그림만 만들어내는 거죠. 그럼 말풍선과 대사는 누가 만들까요? 바로 여러분의 웹 브라우저입니다! AI가 깨끗한 그림을 넘겨주면, 브라우저가 그 위에 말풍선을 그리고, 한글 대사를 얹어주는 방식이에요. 마치 여러분이 지금 보고 있는 이 블로그 글이나 영상 자막처럼, 시스템 폰트를 사용해서 깨끗하고 선명하게 표시하는 원리인 거죠.\n이 방법의 장점은 한글뿐만 아니라 일본어, 중국어 등 어떤 언어든 완벽하게 표시될 수 있다는 점입니다. 게다가 말풍선의 모양이나 위치도 사용자가 자유롭게 바꿀 수 있다는 엄청난 유연성을 제공하죠.\n결론적으로, 이 앱의 핵심 비밀은 \"역할 분담\"에 있습니다. AI는 창의적이고 복잡한 그림을 그리는 일에 집중하고, 정확하고 안정적인 텍스트 표시는 웹 브라우저가 맡는 거죠. 각자 가장 잘하는 일만 하니까 이렇게 완벽하고 효율적인 결과물이 나올 수 있는 겁니다!\n \n[결과물 예시]\n✨ 네컷 만능 만화 생성기: 베이직 vs 프로 버전 비교\n여러분들의 만화 창작 경험을 더욱 풍성하게 만들어 줄 '네컷 만능 만화 생성기'는 베이직(Basic)과 프로(Pro) 두 가지 버전으로 제공됩니다. 어떤 차이가 있는지 아래 표를 통해 자세히 살펴보시고, 여러분의 필요에 맞는 버전을 선택해 보세요.\n기능\n베이직 (Basic)\n프로 (Pro)\n\n\n\n\nAI 대본 생성\n✅\n✅\n\n\n캐릭터 일관성 유지\n✅\n✅\n\n\n다양한 그림 스타일\n일부 제한\n모든 스타일\n\n\n한글 렌더링\n✅\n✅\n\n\n인스타그램 포스팅 지원\n✅\n✅\n\n\n연속 만화 생성\n❌\n✅\n\n\n말풍선 및 텍스트 박스 고급 편집\n제한적\n모든 기능\n\n\n원본 소스 제공\n❌\n✅\n\n\n이용 방법\n무료 배포\n유튜브 채널 멤버십 가입\n\n\n\n[4컷 만능 만화 생성기 BASIC 무료 사용하기]\n\n \n로그인 - Google 계정\n이메일 또는 휴대전화\naccounts.google.com\n\n \n⚠️ 주의! 프로 버전의 고급 기능과 원본 소스 파일은 특정 유튜브 채널 멤버십에 가입해야만 이용할 수 있습니다. 자세한 내용은 해당 채널의 설명을 확인해 주세요.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 그림 실력 없이도 웹툰 작가의 꿈을 현실로!

VISTA 멀티 에이전트 시스템 기반의 'VISTA Prompt Enhancer' 무료 앱으로 Veo3 같은 최첨단 AI의 잠재력을 100% 끌어올려 보세요. 2025년, 더 이상 복잡한 프롬프트 엔지니어링에 시간 낭비하지 마세요!\n  AI 영상 제작의 새로운 지평을 열다: Veo3와 VISTA의 만남\n\n\n 우리는 상상 이상의 속도로 발전하는 AI 기술의 시대에 살고 있습니다. 특히 Google Veo3나 OpenAI Sora와 같은 텍스트-투-비디오(Text-to-Video) AI 모델들은 몇 줄의 문장만으로도 놀랍도록 현실적인 영상을 만들어내며 전 세계를 놀라게 했죠. 솔직히 말하면, 저도 처음엔 정말 놀랐습니다.\n하지만 멋진 아이디어를 AI에게 '어떻게' 설명해야 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있을까요? 단순한 아이디어와 AI 영상 사이에는 '프롬프트'라는 중요한 다리가 있습니다. 이 다리를 얼마나 정교하고 튼튼하게 놓느냐에 따라 영상의 품질이 하늘과 땅 차이로 달라지죠. 복잡한 영상은 시각, 청각, 시간 흐름까지 고려해야 해서 프롬프트 작성이 특히 어렵습니다.\n그래서 저희는 이 고민을 해결하고자 VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent)라는 혁신적인 멀티 에이전트 시스템을 기반으로 한 'VISTA Prompt Enhancer'를 개발했습니다. 그리고 기쁜 소식! 이 강력한 앱을 지금 바로 무료로 배포합니다! 이제 여러분의 소중한 영상 아이디어를 전문적인 비디오 제작 브리핑 수준의 프롬프트로 변환하여 AI의 잠재력을 100% 끌어낼 수 있습니다.\n  VISTA는 무엇이고, 왜 필요할까요?\nVISTA는 단순한 프롬프트 생성기가 아닙니다. 영상 제작 프로세스를 인간처럼 반복적으로 개선하는 방법을 AI에 적용한 멀티 에이전트 시스템이에요. 즉, AI가 스스로 자신의 결과물을 평가하고 더 나은 프롬프트를 만들도록 돕는 똑똑한 조교 같은 거죠. 영상은 한두 장의 이미지와 달리 움직임, 소리, 서사 등 복합적인 요소들이 얽혀 있어 프롬프트의 정교함이 더욱 중요합니다.\n  핵심 개념: 자기 개선형 영상 생성 에이전트\nVISTA는 주어진 프롬프트로 영상을 만들고, 그 영상을 스스로 비평한 후, 비평을 바탕으로 프롬프트를 다시 작성하는 과정을 반복합니다. 마치 감독이 영상을 보면서 '여기는 이런 부분을 수정해야겠다'고 생각하는 것과 똑같아요!\n이 시스템은 크게 두 가지 단계로 작동합니다.\n\n\n1. 초기화 (Initialization) 단계\n사용자의 초기 아이디어를 받으면, VISTA는 이를 구조화된 시간 계획으로 분해하고 다양한 후보 영상들을 생성해요. 이후 견고한 쌍대 토너먼트 방식으로 가장 적합하다고 판단되는 영상과 프롬프트 쌍을 1차적으로 선정합니다.\n2. 자기 개선 (Self-Improvement) 단계\n여기서 VISTA의 진정한 힘이 발휘됩니다. 선정된 영상을 시각, 청각, 그리고 전체적인 맥락에 초점을 맞춘 세 명의 전문 에이전트가 꼼꼼하게 평가해요. 이들은 각각 영상의 색감/구도, 음향 효과/배경 음악, 그리고 스토리텔링/사용자 의도 구현도를 분석합니다.\n시각 에이전트: 영상의 비주얼 요소가 얼마나 프롬프트와 일치하는지, 미학적으로 뛰어난지 평가.\n청각 에이전트: 오디오의 품질, 적절성, 프롬프트와의 조화 여부 분석.\n맥락 에이전트: 전체적인 서사와 사용자 의도가 영상에 잘 담겼는지 종합적으로 판단.\n이 세 에이전트의 피드백을 모아 추론 에이전트가 종합적으로 판단하고, 이를 바탕으로 다음 세대를 위한 더욱 정교하고 풍부한 프롬프트로 재작성합니다. 이 과정이 몇 차례 반복되면, 처음의 단순한 아이디어는 비교할 수 없을 정도로 완성도 높은 영상으로 탄생하게 되는 거죠.\n실험 결과, VISTA는 기존 방법론들이 보여주지 못했던 일관된 영상 품질 향상과 사용자 의도와의 정렬을 보여주며, 심지어 최신 AI 모델들과의 비교에서도 최대 60%의 승률을 기록했다고 해요. 인간 평가자들도 66.4%의 비교에서 VISTA의 결과물을 선호했다고 하니, 그 효과는 정말 놀랍다고 할 수 있습니다.\n  무료 앱 배포! VISTA Prompt Enhancer의 놀라운 기능\n이렇게 강력한 VISTA 방법론을 이제 누구나 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록 'VISTA Prompt Enhancer' 무료 앱으로 만들었습니다! 'GPT PARK'에서 Google의 강력한 Gemini AI와 VISTA 기술을 결합하여 제작한 이 앱은 영상 제작자, 마케터, 아티스트, 그리고 AI 영상 제작에 관심 있는 모든 분을 위한 필수 도구입니다. 정말 정말 강력한 기능이라고 생각해요.\n\n\n  프롬프트 엔지니어링, 이제 전문가에게 맡기세요!\n복잡한 프롬프트 작성 지식 없이도, 여러분의 멋진 아이디어를 세계 최고 수준의 AI 영상 모델에 즉시 사용할 수 있는 전문 영어 프롬프트로 변환해 드립니다.\n초간단 사용법: 10초 만에 프로처럼!\n영상 아이디어를 한국어로 입력하세요. 중앙 텍스트 상자에 만들고 싶은 영상의 컨셉을 자유롭게 적어주세요. 예: \"갑자기 쏟아지는 소나기를 맞으며 웃으며 물웅덩이를 첨벙거리는 커플\"처럼요.\n'프롬프트 생성' 버튼을 클릭하세요. 버튼을 누르면 Gemini AI가 여러분의 아이디어를 분석하기 시작합니다.\n두 가지 전문 프롬프트를 확인하고 활용하세요. 잠시 후, 화면 하단에 '기본 프롬프트'와 'VISTA 프롬프트' 두 가지 결과물이 나타납니다. 복사 버튼을 눌러 원하는 AI 영상 모델에 바로 붙여넣어 사용하면 끝!\n✨ 두 가지 강력한 프롬프트: 기본 vs. VISTA\nVISTA Prompt Enhancer는 여러분의 아이디어 하나로 두 가지 목적에 맞는 프롬프트를 제공합니다. 언제 어떤 프롬프트를 사용해야 할지 알려드릴게요.\n1. 기본 프롬프트 (Original Prompt)\n이 프롬프트는 여러분의 아이디어를 명확하고 간결한 한 문단의 영어 프롬프트로 번역한 것입니다. 컨셉을 빠르게 시각화하거나, 여러 아이디어를 신속하게 테스트해보고 싶을 때 가장 이상적이에요. 복잡한 설정 없이 직관적인 결과를 얻고 싶을 때 유용하죠.\n2.

F 키는 특정 프로그램에 고정된 목적이 없었기 때문에, 각 프로그램은 이 키들을 자신에게 유용한 기능으로 자유롭게 할당할 수 있었습니다. 덕분에 자주 쓰는 기능은 외워서 쓰고, 화면에 표시된 텍스트를 통해 어떤 F 키가 무슨 기능을 하는지 확인하면서 명령줄 프로그램 사용이 훨씬 쉬워졌어요.\n  알고 계셨나요? 레딧 사용자 Kufat에 따르면, 기능키가 가치 있었던 또 다른 깊은 이유가 있대요. 바로 컴퓨터에 명령을 전송하는 데 필요한 입력 횟수를 줄여주었다는 점인데요. 옛날 시스템은 키를 한 번 누를 때마다 메인프레임 작업을 중단시키는 경우가 많았기 때문에, 최소한의 키 입력으로 작업을 수행하는 것이 효율성에 정말 중요했다고 합니다!\n  왜 하필 12개일까? 그 숨겨진 이야기\n왜 기능키가 12개나 되는지에 대한 궁금증, 저도 예전부터 참 많았는데요. 이 질문에 대한 답은 1981년에 출시되어 엄청난 인기를 끌었던 IBM PC에서 찾아볼 수 있습니다. 이 기종이 컴퓨터 업계의 수많은 비공식적인 표준을 만들어냈거든요.\nIBM PC는 처음에는 왼쪽에 10개의 기능키가 달린 Model F 키보드와 함께 출시되었어요. 그런데 IBM은 나중에 더 저렴하고, 지금은 전설적인 키보드로 불리는 Model M 키보드로 이를 교체했습니다. 이 Model M 키보드의 폭발적인 인기는 수많은 복제품을 낳았고, 그 결과 상단에 12개의 기능키가 배열된 이 레이아웃이 오늘날 키보드의 사실상 표준이 되었답니다. 참 재미있죠?\n\n\n  2025년, F1~F12 키의 현대적 활용법 (Windows 기준)\n한때 프로그램별로 자유롭게 프로그래밍되었던 기능키들은 이제 어느 정도 정형화된 목적을 가지게 되었어요. 물론 다양한 프로그램에서 각기 다르게 사용되기도 하지만, 대부분의 앱에서 공통적으로 발견되는 유용한 기능들이 있답니다. 오늘은 2025년 현재 Windows 운영체제를 기준으로 F1부터 F12까지의 주요 기능들을 살펴볼게요. (참고로 Mac 키보드에서는 F 키에 화면 밝기 조절, 미디어 제어 등 다른 기능이 인쇄되어 있고, Fn 키를 눌러야 표준 기능키로 작동해요.)\n기능키\n주요 기능 (Windows)\n팁 & 활용\n\n\n\n\nF1\n대부분의 프로그램에서 도움말(Help) 메뉴 열기\nWin + F1은 Edge에서 \"Windows 11 도움말\"을 검색하니 주의하세요.\n\n\nF2\n파일/폴더 이름 변경, Excel/Google Sheets 셀 편집\n선택된 파일에 F2를 누르면 바로 이름 변경 가능! BIOS 진입 시에도 사용돼요.\n\n\nF3\n프로그램 내 검색 기능 실행 (Ctrl + F와 유사)\n검색 후 F3을 누르면 다음 결과로 이동! 명령 프롬프트에서 이전 명령 반복.\n\n\nF4\n파일 탐색기 주소 표시줄 활성화, Alt + F4로 창 닫기, Ctrl + F4로 탭 닫기\nAlt + F4는 의외로 자주 쓰게 되는 단축키죠!\n\n\nF5\n브라우저/파일 탐색기 새로고침, PowerPoint 슬라이드 쇼 시작\nCtrl + F5는 브라우저 캐시 무시하고 강제 새로고침! 개발자에게 유용해요.\n\n\nF6\n웹 브라우저 주소 표시줄로 커서 이동\n빠르게 검색하거나 다른 페이지로 이동할 때 편리해요.\n\n\nF7\nMS Office 맞춤법 검사, Shift + F7로 동의어 사전, 브라우저에서 '캐럿 탐색' 활성화\nOffice 작업이 많은 분들에게 특히 유용하겠네요.\n\n\nF8\nMS Office 매크로 창, Excel 선택 영역 확장\n예전 Windows에서는 안전 모드 진입 키였으나, 요즘은 사용 빈도가 낮아요.\n\n\nF9\nWord 문서 새로고침, Outlook 수동 송수신, Excel 수식 재계산\nOffice 사용자라면 알아두면 좋은 기능들이 많죠.\n\n\nF10\n앱 메뉴 바 활성화, Shift + F10으로 마우스 우클릭\n마우스가 고장 났거나 키보드만 쓸 때 Shift + F10은 정말 편리해요!\n\n\nF11\n대부분의 앱 전체 화면 모드 전환\n다른 방해 없이 하나의 앱에 집중하고 싶을 때 최고죠!\n\n\nF12\n브라우저 개발자 도구 활성화, 여러 앱에서 다른 이름으로 저장 대화 상자 열기\n웹 개발자들에게 F12는 없어서는 안 될 친구죠!\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의! F 키들은 프로그램에 따라 기능이 달라질 수 있어요. 특히 일부 노트북에서는 Fn 키와 함께 눌러야 본래의 F 키 기능을 하는 경우도 있으니, 사용 전 확인하는 것이 좋겠죠?\n  활용도를 높이는 방법: 기능키 재매핑\n앞서 살펴본 것처럼 F 키들은 여전히 유용하게 쓰이지만, 만약 자신에게 필요한 기능이 아니라면 어떻게 해야 할까요? 저는 개인적으로 F8 키는 거의 쓰지 않는 편인데요. 이런 경우 F 키들을 자신만의 방식으로 재매핑해서 활용도를 극대화할 수 있답니다!\n\n\n특히 Windows 사용자라면, 마이크로소프트의 숨겨진 보석 같은 도구 모음인 PowerToys 스위트에 포함된 '키보드 관리자(Keyboard Manager)' 유틸리티를 활용하는 것을 추천해요. 이 도구를 사용하면 특정 F 키에 원하는 다른 키 조합이나 명령을 할당할 수 있어서, 나만의 맞춤형 키보드를 만들 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 자주 사용하는 특정 프로그램을 실행하거나, 복잡한 단축키를 F8 하나로 대체하는 식이죠. 정말 편리하지 않나요?\n✨ 핵심 요약: F 기능키, 과거와 현재를 잇다\n  핵심 요약\n1. 기능키의 탄생 배경: 1960~70년대 그래픽 없는 컴퓨터 시대, 복잡한 명령어를 빠르게 입력하기 위한 효율적인 수단으로 개발되었습니다.\n2. 12개 표준의 비밀: 1981년 출시된 IBM PC와 Model M 키보드의 폭발적인 인기가 오늘날 12개의 기능키 배열을 표준으로 만들었습니다.\n3. 오늘날의 F 키 활용: 도움말(F1), 이름 변경(F2), 새로고침(F5), 전체 화면(F11) 등 다양한 프로그램에서 유용하게 사용되는 핵심 기능들이 많습니다.\n4. 나만의 기능키 만들기: PowerToys의 '키보드 관리자' 같은 도구를 이용해 F 키를 재매핑하여 자신만의 맞춤형 단축키로 활용할 수 있습니다.\n기능키는 단순한 키보드 버튼을 넘어, 컴퓨터 발전의 한 단면을 보여주는 흥미로운 유산입니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 기능키는 모든 운영체제에서 동일하게 작동하나요?\n아니요, 그렇지 않습니다. 오늘 글에서는 Windows 운영체제를 기준으로 설명했지만, Mac 키보드의 F 키는 기본적으로 밝기 조절, 미디어 제어 등 다른 멀티미디어 기능을 수행하며, Fn 키를 눌러야 일반적인 F 키로 작동합니다. Linux 등 다른 운영체제에서도 프로그램에 따라 기능이 달라질 수 있습니다.\nQ2: F 키의 원래 기능이 아닌 다른 기능으로 바꾸는 방법이 있나요?\n네, 가능합니다. Windows 사용자라면 Microsoft PowerToys 스위트에 포함된 '키보드 관리자(Keyboard Manager)' 유틸리티를 사용하면 F 키에 다른 키 조합이나 원하는 명령을 할당하여 재매핑할 수 있습니다. Mac 사용자 역시 시스템 설정에서 기능키를 재설정할 수 있습니다.\nQ3: F 키 중 가장 유용한 키는 무엇이라고 생각하세요?\n제 개인적인 경험으로는 F5 (새로고침), F2 (이름 변경/셀 편집), 그리고 Alt + F4 (창 닫기)가 가장 빈번하게 사용되고 유용하다고 생각합니다. 특히 웹 서핑이나 문서 작업 시 시간을 크게 절약해주는 기능들이죠. 물론 사용자마다 선호하는 기능은 다를 수 있습니다!\n { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"기능키는 모든 운영체제에서 동일하게 작동하나요?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"아니요, 그렇지 않습니다. 오늘 글에서는 Windows 운영체제를 기준으로 설명했지만, Mac 키보드의 F 키는 기본적으로 밝기 조절, 미디어 제어 등 다른 멀티미디어 기능을 수행하며, Fn 키를 눌러야 일반적인 F 키로 작동합니다.

시작됐습니다. 42.195km를 달리는 선수들의 얼굴에는 그 숭고한 정신이 고스란히 담겨 있죠. 그래서 마라톤은 인간이 한계를 넘어 도전하는 정신의 상징이 되어왔고, 오랫동안 ‘올림픽 정신’을 대표하는 엘리트 선수*들의 무대였습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*

위해 당시 보스턴 마라톤에는 출전할 수 없었던 여성들의 참여를 이끌어내기 위해 힘썼고, 마침 미국 사회에 불던 페미니즘 흐름과 맞물리며 양성평등의 가치를 실현한 대회로 정체성을 만들어 갔습니다.\n* 보스턴, 시카고, 뉴욕, 베를린, 런던, 도쿄, 시드니에서 열리는 세계 주요 마라톤 대회\n\n웰니스 라이프의 아이콘이 된 뉴욕 시티 마라톤 완주 메달 / 사진: Sipa USA\n1970년대, 미국 전역에는 러닝 붐이 일었습니다. 베트남전의 후유증과 히피문화, 시민운동의 물결을 지나며 사람들이 복잡한 세상 속에서 자기 삶의 균형을 찾기 시작했기 때문이죠. 달리기는 단순한 운동을 넘어 스스로를 건강하게 관리하는 수단이 되었고, 한 해 평균 200개에 달하는 마라톤 대회가 열릴 만큼 인기는 폭발적이었습니다. 도심 공원에서 러닝화를 신고 달리는 중산층에게 러닝은 자기 관리의 상징이 되었습니다.\n뉴욕 시티 마라톤을 주최하는 뉴욕 로드 러너스 클럽(New York Road Runners Club, NYRRC)은 이 흐름을 정확히 읽었습니다. 그들은 엘리트 중심의 대회 대신, 모든 성별과 연령에 열려 있을 뿐만 아니라 완주만으로도 의미가 있는 대회를 만들었습니다. 시간에 상관없이 끝까지 달릴 수만 있다면 누구나 피니시 라인에서 메달을 받을 수 있었고, 이 메달은 웰니스 라이프를 상징하는 의식으로 자리 잡았습니다.\n시간이 흐르며 뉴욕 마라톤은 러닝 문화와 젠더 평등, 그리고 도시 브랜딩이 맞물린 하나의 아이콘이 되었죠. 2025년 대회 참가 신청자는 20만 명. 완주자는 5만 명이 넘고, 경제효과는 약 1조 원에 이릅니다. 기록의 무대였던 마라톤이 사람들의 무대로 옮겨가면서 거대한 산업으로 발전하게 된 것입니다.\n러닝 슈즈의 대명사로\n떠오른 나이키\n이런 흐름 속에서 함께 성장한 브랜드가 있습니다. 바로 나이키입니다. 1970년대 초, 나이키는 가볍고 쿠션감이 뛰어난 러닝화 ‘코르테즈’를 선보였습니다. 이 모델은 높은 기술적 완성도로 주목받을 수 있었죠.\n러닝 붐 덕분에 매출이 급증한 나이키는 1973년에 미국 장거리 육상 스타 ‘스티브 프리폰테인’ 후원 계약에도 성공합니다. 트랙 위에서 누구보다 거침없던 그는 나이키가 추구한 ‘두려움 없는 도전’을 내세우기에 가장 적절한 인물이었습니다. 이 시기를 기점으로 나이키는 단순한 스포츠 용품 회사를 넘어 도전과 용기라는 철학을 담는 브랜드로 자리 잡습니다.\n\n스티브 프리폰테인이 실제 착용했던 나이키 코르테즈 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\n1971년에는 28억 원에 불과하던 나이키 매출은 1973년 410억 원, 1981년에는 642억 원으로 성장했습니다. 글로벌 기업으로 성장한 나이키 성공 신화의 시작점을 마라톤 붐이 불었던 1970년대로 평가하는 이유도 바로 여기에 있죠.\n포스트 팬데믹 시대,제2의 러닝 붐\n첫 번째 러닝 붐이 일어난 지 50년이 흐른 뒤, 코로나19가 다시 세상을 바꿨습니다. 실내 스포츠가 멈춘 팬데믹 시기, 사람들은 집 밖으로 나와 달리기 시작합니다. 헬스장 대신 공원이, 실내 트랙 대신 도심이 운동장이 되어, 러닝화를 신은 사람들로 거리가 채워졌습니다.\n영국 경제지 <이코노미스트>에 따르면, 2023년 전 세계 스포츠 슈즈 매출은 2018년에 비해 50%나 늘었습니다. 그 배경에는 팬데믹이 만든 새로운 습관이 있었죠. 야외를 달리는 경험이 ‘심리적 해방’과 ‘자기 회복’을 상징하게 된 겁니다.\n2024년 런던과 뉴욕 시티 마라톤 참가자는 각각 55,000명을 넘어 역대 최고치를 기록했습니다. 세계 곳곳에서 러닝 크루와 러너스 클럽이 생겨났고, SNS에는 해시태그 #RunningCrew, #RunForLife가 넘쳐났습니다.\n한국도 예외가 아니었습니다. 소셜 미디어를 통해 건강한 라이프스타일을 공유하는 문화가 퍼지면서, 젊은 세대에게 러닝은 ‘트렌디한 자기관리’가 되었습니다. 달리는 일은 곧 새로운 일상의 리추얼이 되었죠.\n러닝 아이콘으로 떠오른\n온 러닝과 호카\n제2의 러닝 붐은 스포츠 브랜드의 판도까지 바꿔놓았습니다. 그 중심에는 호카(HOKA)와 온 러닝(On Running)이 있습니다.\n얼핏 보면 다소 투박해 보이지만, 호카 러닝화는 압도적인 쿠셔닝으로 러너들의 발을 사로잡았습니다. 2024년 매출은 전년 대비 27.9% 증가한 2조 5,689억 원. 이 성장세에 힘입어 호카는 마라토너들이 가장 선호하는 브랜드 5위로 올라섰습니다.\n온 러닝은 기술과 디자인 두 가지 모두에서 혁신을 보여줍니다. 클라우드텍(CloudTec) 기술은 달릴 때 충격을 최소화하고, 지면을 부드럽게 밀어주는 추진력을 만들어냅니다. 최근에는 스페인의 로에베(Loewe), 한국의 포스트 아카이브 팩션(PAF)과 협업하며 패션 슈즈 시장까지 공략하고 있죠. 기술적 완성도에 더해 디자인 감각까지 인정받은 온 러닝은 2024년 매출 3조 5,672억 원을 기록하며 전년 대비 30% 이상 성장했습니다.\n\n호카와 온 러닝의 상승세는 주가에도 그대로 반영됐습니다. 2024년 한 해 동안 호카는 약 1.9배, 온 러닝은 2배 가까이 주가가 뛰었습니다. 반면 전통의 강자 나이키는 하락세를 면치 못했습니다. 판매 전략의 부진뿐 아니라, 기술과 디자인 모두에서 새로운 변화를 보여주지 못했기 때문입니다.\n1970년대 러닝 붐의 상징이 나이키였다면, 이제 포스트 팬데믹 세대를 대표하는 브랜드는 호카와 온 러닝입니다. 달리기가 다시 한 번 시대의 문화를 바꾸고 있는 셈이죠.\n하코네 에키덴,\n작은 온천 마을을 들썩이는 달리기\n일본의 온천 마을 ‘하코네’는 인구 12,000명 남짓한 작은 마을이지만, 새해 첫 이틀 동안은 전혀 다른 세상이 됩니다. 10명의 대학생이 한 팀을 이뤄 도쿄에서 하코네까지 왕복 200km를 달리는 ‘하코네 에키덴’이 열리면서 관광객과 취재진으로 가득 차기 때문이죠. 하코네 에키덴은 요미우리 신문사와 간토* 학생육상경기연맹이 공동 주최하는 대학생 릴레이 마라톤 대회입니다.\n*도쿄를 중심으로 하는 일본의 수도권 지역\n마라톤 대회가 펼쳐지는 이틀 동안 하코네에는 100만 명 넘는 관광객이 몰리고, TV 시청률은 30%에 육박합니다. 다매체·다채널 시대라는 점을 감안하면, 이 수치는 월드컵이나 올림픽에 견줄 만한 기념비적인 기록이죠. 일본에서는 “하코네 에키덴을 봐야 새해가 시작된다”는 말이 있을 정도로 관심이 뜨겁습니다.\n\n각 학교 이름이 적힌 띠를 두르고 릴레이로 달리는 하코네 에키덴 / 사진: KYODO\n일본 국민의 높은 관심과 대학 간 치열한 경쟁 덕분에, 하코네 에키덴의 광고 효과는 막대합니다. 일본 PR 리서치 기관의 조사에 따르면, 우승 대학의 광고 효과는 약 130억 원, 후원 기업의 광고 효과는 600억 원에 달합니다. 메인 스폰서인 삿포로 맥주는 매년 약 100억 원을 후원하고 있으며, 이 같은 후원금 덕분에 간토 학생육상경기연맹은 개최 비용을 제외하고도 매년 약 30억 원의 수익을 거두고 있습니다.\n하코네 에키덴이 특별한 이유는 경쟁의 바탕에 ‘이야기’가 있다는 점입니다. 교통사고 후유증을 이겨내고 달리는 학생, 부진한 기록에 책임감을 느껴 1년을 휴학하고 훈련에 매진한 학생 등 기록보다 대회에 참가한 선수들의 사연에 더 많은 응원이 쏟아집니다. 대회 기간 동안 마을 상점들은 대학별 깃발을 내걸고, 자원봉사자들은 관광객들과 함께 진심을 다해 호흡합니다. 온천 스튜빵 같은 지역 명물은 금세 동이 나죠.\n하코네는 이 대회의 영향 덕분에 겨울 비수기에도 활기를 잃지 않습니다. 2024년 하코네를 찾은 관광객은 2,000만 명을 넘어섰고, 이틀간의 대회는 1년 동안 마을에 원동력을 불어넣는 ‘축제의 경제’를 만들어냅니다. 하코네 에키덴은 마라톤이 도시를, 그리고 사람의 마음을 움직이는 힘을 가장 잘 보여주는 대회라고 할 수 있습니다.\n우리나라에도 찾아온\n달리기 붐\n이제 한국에서도 달리기가 새로운 도시 문화로 자리 잡고 있습니다. 국내 러닝 인구는 1,000만 명을 넘었고, 1년 동안 열리는 마라톤 대회만 400개가 넘습니다. 춘천마라톤, 경주국제마라톤, 제주국제마라톤은 이미 대표적인 오픈 대회로 자리 잡았고, 반려견과 함께 달리는 ‘댕댕런’, 완주 후 빵을 받을 수 있는 ‘빵빵런’ 같은 이색 대회도 생겨나고 있죠.\n한국의 마라톤 대회도 앞으로 ‘엘리트 러너들의 기록’이 아니라 ‘우리들의 스토리’로 채워져야 합니다. 기록이 아닌 이야기로 완주하는 마라톤이야말로, 도시를 움직이는 진짜 이벤트로 자라날 겁니다. 뉴욕 시티 마라톤과 하코네 에키덴이 그랬듯이 말입니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",

.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}미국인들은 한 해 평균 454달러(약 64만 원)를 팁으로 지출한다. 더구나 팬데믹 이후 팁 비율은 평균 15%에서 22%로 상승했다. 팁에 대한 부담이 날로 커지고 있으니, 미국인의 66%가 팁

change)”라는 인사와 함께 가볍게 잔돈을 남기는 문화도 있다. 나라마다 팁을 주는 방식이 다르다 보니 해외 여행을 갈 때  ‘팁 지불 요령’을 배우기도 한다. 팁은 오랜 세월 이어온 문화 현상이지만 경제적 의미는 여전히 흥미로운 질문으로 남겨져 있다.\n뉴질랜드 ‘경쟁 및 규제연구소(ISCR)’의 연구원 스틴 비데벡(Steen Videbeck)은 팁 문화에 관해 중요한 성찰을 남겼다. 그의 연구에 따르면 첫째, 팁 문화는 우선 고용주와 종업원 간의 문제(principal-agent problem)로 볼 수 있다. 고용주는 팁을 허용함으로써 종업원이 정해진 급여 외에 별도의 보상을 얻도록 한다. 이를 통해 종업원은 고용주가 없을 때도 더 열심히 일을 하고, 결과적으로 고용주 또한 가게 운영에서 이득을 본다. 둘째, 종업원 간의 공정한 경쟁을 유도하는 장치(separating equilibrium)로 작동한다. 일을 잘하고 손님을 만족시키는 종업원은 더 많은 팁을 받으며 자신이 인정받는다는 만족감을 느낀다. 반대로 그렇지 못한 종업원은 자신의 문제를 고치려 할 것이기 때문에, 이러한 구조 속에서 가게는 보다 활력있는 조직으로 유지될 수 있다.\n하지만 일반적인 경제 활동과 비교해 보았을 때 팁 문화는 역설적이다. 할인 경쟁이 치열하고, 소비자들이 ‘더 싸게 사기 위해’ 애쓰는 것이 요즘의 트렌드 아닌가. 하지만 팁은 소비자가 자발적으로 더 많은 돈을 내는 행위이다. 스틴 비데벡은 팁 문화가 ‘모든 인간은 자신의 효용을 극대화하는 합리적 존재’라는 경제학의 기본 전제와 어긋난다고 주장하며 부정적인 결론에 도달한다. \n2,547개의 식사 그룹을 설문 조사한 결과, 팁을 준 사람들이 서비스가 더 좋아졌다고 느낀 비율은 거의 없었다. 팁을 주는 이유 또한 인정이 넘쳐서 혹은 종업원에 대한 동정심 때문인 경우도 많지 않았다. 대부분은 단지 팁이 오래전부터 정례화된 관습이기 때문에, 물건값을 지불하듯 팁을 낼 뿐이었다. 결국 사람들은 팁을 주지 않았을 때 따라붙는 사회적 낙인(stigma)을 피하기 위해 돈을 더 내는, ‘합리적 인간이 되기 위한 비합리적인 선택’을 한다는 것이다.\n바로 이 지점에서 소비자들의 불만이 싹트기 시작한다. 팁을 내든 안 내든 서비스의 수준이 크게 다르지 않다면 왜 비용을 더 내야 한단 말인가. 더구나 요즘은 키오스크가 대세다. 종업원의 손길을 전혀 거치지 않은 화면 앞에서 “팁을 내시겠습니까?”라는 문구를 마주할 때, 소비자는 다시 한번 묻게 된다. ‘이건 누구를 위한 팁인가?’\n미국에서 팁은 왜 암묵적인 룰이 되었나\n팁 문화의 기원은 유럽이다. 다만 언제, 어떻게 이런 관습이 생겼는지에 대해서는 논의가 분분하다. 통상 중세 귀족과 농노 간의 관습으로 추청하는데 부유한 귀족이 가난한 농노에게 한두 푼 수고비를 얹어주는 문화에서 시작되었다고 본다. 그리고 19세기 중반 부유한 미국인들이 유럽을 여행하며 팁 문화를 배웠고 귀족처럼 굴기 위해 팁을 주기 시작했다는 것이 통설이다.\n캘리포니아 대학교 식품 노동 연구센터장 사루 자야라만(Saru Jayaraman)은 팁의 역사를 추적하며,  남북전쟁과 노예제도에 주목했다. 남북전쟁을 통해 노예제도는 종식되었지만 해방된 노예가 할 수 있는 일이 제한적이었고 따라서 그들은 하인, 웨이터, 이발사 같은 서비스 노동에 종사했다. 이 중 식당 종업원이나 철도 짐꾼은 임금을 받는 대신 소액의 팁을 받았는데 이것이 오늘날 미국 팁 문화의 기원이라는 것이다.\n1850~60년대 식당 노동자들은 주로 뉴욕과 같은 도시에 있었는데, 백인 노동자들이 농촌에서 공장 일을 찾아 도시로 이주해 오던 시기였다. 농장에서 일할 때는 집에서 식사를 해결했지만, 도시로 옮겨오면서 외식 수요가 급증했다 (...) 일종의 ‘초기형 패스트푸드 식당’들이 등장했다. 공장 노동자들에게는 약 15분 정도의 식사 시간이 주어졌다. 그들은 '페니 플레이스(penny places)'라는 곳으로 달려가 음식을 집어 들고, 옛 노예들이 음식을 차려줄 때처럼 테이블에 1페니 동전을 올려놓았다.\n- 워싱턴 포스트, 로베르토 A. 페르드먼, ‘I dare you to read this and still feel good about tipping’ 기사 중, 2016.2.18\n위의 기사 역시 같은 맥락이다. 19세기 미국에서 산업혁명이 일어났고 백인 노동자가 도시 공장으로 몰려들면서 식습관에 중대한 변화가 일어난다. 집에서 식사를 했던 백인 노동자는 이제 식당에서 끼니를 때워야 할 처지가 된 것이다. 빠르게 식사를 마치고 곧바로 일터로 돌아가야만 했다. 백인 노동자들의 수요에 부응하기 위해 식당은 값싸고 빠른 음식을 내놓을 수밖에 없었다. 낮은 임금으로 부릴 수 있는 흑인이 주방과 홀을 채웠다. 그리고 이들은 일정한 급여 대신 백인 손님이 건네는 팁으로 하루하루를 살아갔다.\n당시 흑인에 대한 열악한 처우는 사회 문제가 되었으며, 이런 불합리한 팁문화를 퇴출해야 한다는 반(反)팁운동(anti-tipping movement)이 강력하게 일어났다. 워싱턴주와 여러 남부 주를 포함해 전국의 6개 주에서는 반팁 법안이 통과 되기도 했다. 하지만 낮은 임금의 매력으로 인해 이 고용주들의 반발이 심했고 몇년만에 법안은 폐지되고 만다. 오히려 반팁운동이 결과적으로 성공을 거둔 곳은 미국이 아닌 유럽이었다.  유럽의 경우 사회주의를 비롯하여 각종 사회운동이 이어졌던데 반해 기업 문화가 강하고 전세계에서 이민자들이 밀려들어왔기 때문이다. “노동자는 팁에 의존해 살아서는 안 되며, 정당한 임금을 고용주로부터 받아야 한다”는 목소리를 외치며 결국 팁 문화가 옅어진 곳은 유럽이었고, 반대로 미국에서는 팁 문화가 끈질기게 이어져 오고 있다.\n오늘날 미국에서 벌어지는 팁 문화 논쟁의 중심에는 저임금 노동자의 임금 문제가 놓여 있다. 서빙 직원의 상당수가 유색인종인 경우가 많고, 이들은 동일한 노동을 하고도 백인 종업원과 같은 임금을 받지 못한다. 2022년 뉴욕시 의회가 발표한 자료를 보면, 유색인종 종업원의 평균 임금은 백인 대비 84% 수준에 불과했고, 그중 여성의 경우는 60% 수준에 그쳤다. 더구나 업주가 급여를 계산할 때 팁을 포함해서 최저임금을 맞추는 경우도 많다. 즉, 손님이 팁을 주지 않으면 법정 최저임금조차 보장받지 못하는 구조인 것이다. 한국인에게는 팁 문화가 그저 생소하거나 키오스크가 보편화되는 시대에 어울리지 않는  관습 정도로 여겨질 수 있다. 하지만 팁 문화가 일반적인 나라에서는 팁이 단순한 예의가 아니라 노동자의 생계와 직결된 중대한 문제인 것이다.\n우리나라에 팁이 없는 이유\n반면 한국에서는 팁 문화가 자리 잡지 못했는데, 이는 팁에 대한 부정적 인식이 강했기 때문이다. 팁문화는 유흥업소나 골프장 등 일부 서비스 업종에만 있었다. 팁은 소위 ‘가진 사람들’의 과시 행위에 불과했으며 이에 대한 비판 또한 거셌다.\n팁이 너무 많다면서도 ‘아낌없이 뿌리는 사람들’이 많다. 해가 기울고 네온이 켜지는 거리, 주로 도시 사람들의 경우, 나이트클럽, 캬바레 요정, 살롱 홀, 바 그리고 ‘니나노집’에 이르기까지 많은 술집에서 술을 마시고 춤을 추고나서 으레 팁을 준다. 꼭 밤의 이야기만도 아니다. 터키탕, 이발관, 미용실에서 몸을 씻고 그리고 머리를 다듬는다. 호텔이나 여관에서 묵고 나오는 외국손님, 시골손님들이 있다. 어떤 사람들은 골프장에서 한나절을 보낸다. 그러고 나선 거의 누구나 팁을 준다.\n- 동아일보, ‘폐습’ 기사 중, 1972\n위의 기사 내용은 팁을 ‘고마운 노고에 대해 고마운 뜻을 담아주는 것’이라 규정했으며 ‘터무니없이 많은 액수’가 오가서는 안 된다고 못을 박는다. 흥미로운 점은 팁 문화의 기원을 ‘놀이나 놀음이 끝난 뒤 기생이나 광대에게 주는 보수’로 보았다는 점이다. 1980년대 저명한 언론인 이규태는 “부잣집에서는 사랑방에 인정주머니를 걸어두고 심부름 온 종이나 가마꾼, 말꾼, 부고 전하는 인부 등등에 인정”을 주는 것이 팁 문화의 기원이라 설명하기도 했다. 즉, 팁 문화는 조선시대부터 내려온 일부 상류층의 문화 혹은 특별한 날에 여흥을 즐기는 소소한 문화에 불과한데 이를 남용하여 큰돈이 오가고, 손님은 부를 과시하고 종업원이 이를 즐기는 것은 도덕적으로 옳지 못하다는 주장이다.\n1970년대 후반 정부는 팁 문화가 사회 전반으로 확산되는 것을 경계했다. 당시 국세청과 서울시는 ‘건전사회 기풍조성과 소비절약운동’의 일환으로 대한요식업중앙회에 팁은 만 원 이상 받을 수 없다고 통보했다. 단순한 권고사항이 아니었다. ‘월 1회 정기점검과 불시점검을 통해 위반업소를 강력히 단속’하겠다며 업주들에게 으름장을 놓았으니 말이다. 이러한 움직임은 1990년대에도 이어졌다. 학계와 언론에서는 팁 문화를 사치나 과시의 상징으로 비판했고 정부는 유흥업소에서 벌어지는 좋지 못한 관행 중 하나로 분류했다. 한국에 팁 문화가 없는 이유이다.\n작은 관습에도 역사가 있고 경제가 있다. 오늘날 미국의 팁 문화 논쟁을 두고 후대의 역사가는 기술혁신의 가속화나 미국의 경제적 쇠퇴 등을 이유로 꼽을지도 모른다. 그렇다면 한국은 어떨까. 짜장면 위에 올려지던 메추리알과 오이가 사라진 지 오래고, 이제는 반찬값을 따로 받는 식당도 보인다. 최근에는 팁 박스를 비치했다가 악평에 시달린 가게도 등장했다. 해외의 팁 문화를 목격하며 놀라지만 우리 역시 정과 인심이 점점 비용으로 환산되고 있다. 일상의 사소한 변화가 우리 사회의 방향을 묻고 있는 것이다.\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

(중략) 스스로를 하나의 결정된 이미지로 생각하지 마시고 스펙트럼으로 바라보자는 거죠..css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n\n#2. 과학 커뮤니케이터, 이정모\n이정모 관장 / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n이정모 관장은 인간이 다른 동물에 비해 타인을 더 잘 구분할 수 있는 이유가 '방추상회'라는 뇌의 한 부분 때문이라고 말합니다. 뇌의 대부분은 일정 시기가 되면 성장을 멈추지만, 얼굴 정보를 인식하는 방추상회는 새로운 얼굴을 만날 때마다 계속 발달하죠.\n유전학적으로 보면 인류의 DNA는 99.9% 동일합니다. 유전자의 대부분이 같은데도 그 작은 0.1%의 차이가 사람 사이의 모든 차이를 만들어내는 것이죠. 인류의 진화 관점에서 보면 0.1%의 유전적인 차이와 그것을 알아보는 능력이 오랜 기간 유지되는 이유는 그만큼 인류에게 ‘고유성’이 중요했기 때문일 것입니다.\nQ. 과학자로서 얼굴에는 어떤 힘이 있다고 생각하시나요?\nA. 얼굴은 가장 본질적이고, 타인과 나를 구분짓는 것이라고 볼 수 있죠. 유전자의 0.1% 차이가 드러나는 가장 확실한 영역이 바로 얼굴이니까요. 다른 사람과 구분되는 유일한 것이 있다는 말은 그만큼, ‘내가 소중하고 귀한 존재’라는 의미로도 해석할 수 있습니다. 결론적으로 이 고유성이 인간의 가치를 증명하는 셈이기도 합니다.\n\n#3. 배우, 문소리\n문소리 배우 / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n문소리 배우에게 얼굴은 내면이 고스란히 드러나는 곳입니다. 캐릭터가 처한 상황, 역사, 감정을 내면화하다보면 그 모든 것이 자연스럽게 얼굴에 표현되기 때문입니다. '이런 모습이어야 한다'고 미리 정해두고 거기에 얼굴을 맞추려 하면 오히려 좋은 연기를 하기 어렵다고도 합니다. 몸과 마음, 정신과 감정이 유기적으로 결합될 때 꾸며내지 않은 진짜 얼굴이 만들어지는 거죠.\n하지만 배우에게 얼굴은 양가적인 주제입니다. 카메라 앞에서 가장 정면에 드러나기 때문에 얼굴이 중요하다고 느끼면서도, 동시에 '얼굴은 내 몸의 한 부분일 뿐, 전부가 아니라고’ 생각하기도 합니다. 특히 노화 앞에서 이 감정은 더욱 선명해집니다. 노화가 보이지 않도록 관리해야 할 것 같은 마음과 자연스러운 주름이 여과 없이 드러나길 바라는 마음이 늘 공존하죠.\n결국 배우 문소리가 도달한 지점은 '받아들임'입니다. 도서관에서 평생 일한 사람의 얼굴에는 도서관이 담기듯, 우리가 살아온 삶이 담긴 얼굴 그 자체를 인정하자는 의미이기도 합니다. 다시 말해 얼굴은 나의 모든 역사를 담고 있고, 그래서 좋아하는 부분도 미워하는 부분도 하나같이 소중한 흔적이라는 것이죠.\nQ. 배우 문소리에게 얼굴이란, 어떤 의미일까요?\nA. (내 얼굴을) 일단 받아들이게 된 것 같아요. 이게 내 얼굴인걸요. 달라지길 원하지도 않고, (내 얼굴의) 강점도 약점도 알고…결국은 그 얼굴을 우리가 얼만큼 받아들이고, 사랑하고 있는지가 (중요하지 않나).\n\n#4. 관상가, 신기원\n신기원 관상가 / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n신기원 관상가는 60년간 관상을 본 베테랑입니다. 흔히 관상은 ‘얼굴 생김새만’ 보고 판단하는 것으로 생각할 수 있지만, 사실은 내면까지도 들여다본다고 합니다. 구체적으로는 그 사람의 얼굴에 담긴 타고난 ‘기운’을 종합적으로 판단하는 것입니다.\n그는 아무리 모습이 비슷한, 설사 쌍둥이일지라도 완벽히 똑같은 얼굴이나 운명은 없다고 단언합니다. 이를 관상학적으로는 말하자면 하늘, 땅, 음과 양의 원리가 얼굴과 몸에 반영되어 ‘그 사람만의 고유한 기운이 생기기 때문’이죠.\nQ. 관상학적으로 ‘얼굴을 본다’는 것은 어떤 의미일까요?\nA. 얼굴에 담겨 있는 기운, 그 기운을 보는 거예요. 외모를 봐야 기운을 알죠.\n\n#5. 성형외과 의사, 유희진\n유희진 교수 / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n유희진 교수는 재건 성형 분야의 전문가입니다. 재건 성형이란 사고나 질병, 선천적 요인으로 잃어버린 부위를 복원하는 의학 분야로, 단순히 기능을 되찾는 것을 넘어 미용적 요소까지 고려해 환자가 '잃어버린 나'를 찾아가도록 돕습니다.\n흥미로운 점은 성형외과 의사인 그가 성형을 바라보는 관점입니다. 많은 사람들이 성형을 '단순히 더 나은 얼굴로 바꾸는 일’이라고 생각하지만, 그는 오히려 '고유성을 되찾는 과정'으로 봅니다. 환자들이 아예 새로운 얼굴을 원하기보다는 내가 원했던 ‘나의 얼굴’, 더 ‘나다웠으면’ 하는 얼굴을 찾으려 하기 때문이죠. 동시에 눈코입을 바꿔도 변하지 않는 것들이 있습니다. 바로 표정 근육의 움직임이나 그 사람 특유의 분위기는 그대로 남아 있죠.\nQ. 아무리 성형을 해도 달라지지 않는 것이 있다면요?\nA. 사람 얼굴이 가지고 있는 표정 근육이나 움직임은 잘 변하지 않아요. 눈코입이나 골격을 바꾼다 해도 미세한 움직임 등은 바뀌기가 어렵거든요. 첫 눈에는 ‘어 달라보인다’ 해도 자세히 들여다 보면 금방 그 사람인 것을 알아챌 수 있어요. 이런 건 단순히 외면이 아닌 내재된 것들이잖아요. 이런 것들이 사람들의 고유성을 규정짓는 것 같아요. 그게 가장 확실하게 드러나는 게 얼굴이고요.\n\n#6. 인공지능 연구자, 김익재 \n김익재 소장 / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n김익재 연구소장은 인공지능이라는 용어가 상용화되기도 전부터 이를 기반으로 얼굴의 움직임을 생성하고 재현하는 연구를 해왔습니다. 특히 2015년에는 광복 70주년을 맞아 ‘Age Progression’(나이 변환 기술)이라는 기술을 활용하여 이산가족들의 어릴 적 사진으로 현재의 나이든 모습을 구현하고, 전시하는 프로젝트에 참여했습니다. 당시 기술적 한계 속에서도 총 스물세 가족을 위해 현재의 예상 모습을 반영한 얼굴을 보여주었을 때 이산가족들이 큰 감동을 받았고, 연구자로서도 큰 보람을 느꼈습니다.\n그는 동시에 얼굴 인식의 궁극적인 목표가 사람을 통제하는 도구가 아닌, 인간 개개인의 유일성을 존중하고 보증하는 ‘수단’이 되어야 한다고 말합니다.\nQ. 앞으로 얼굴인식 기술은 어떻게 발전할까요?\nA. 단순히 이 사람이 ‘누구인지’ 확인하는 차원을 넘어서서, 각자의 얼굴에 담긴 고유성을 과학적으로 증명하는 것이 얼굴 인식 기술을 개발하는 지향점이 되지 않을까 싶습니다.\n\n#7. FacePay(페이스페이) 플랫폼PO, 신유진\n신유진 플랫폼PO / 출처: 오리지널 필름 <The Power of FACE>\n영상 끝에는 페이스페이를 개발한 신유진 플랫폼PO*가 등장해 토스가 기술을 대하는 방식을 설명합니다. 그에게 오프라인 결제 시장은 '사람들의 삶을 이롭게 바꿀 수 있는' 기회의 영역이었습니다. 카드와 휴대폰 결제만으로도 이미 충분히 편리해 보이지만, 토스는 여기서 안주하지 않았습니다. 사용자에게 더 나은 결제 경험을 주기 위해 고민 끝에 선택한 새로운 결제 수단은 바로 '얼굴'이었습니다. 왜 얼굴이었을까요?  \n*플랫폼PO는 토스에서 기술의 쓰임과 가치를 찾고, 사용자의 편리함과 신뢰를 설계하는 역할을 맡고 있어요.\n우리가 일상적으로 사용하는 기존의 결제 수단들은, 실제 결제를 하기까지 생각보다 많은 행동을 필요로 합니다. 지갑을 꺼내고, 카드를 고르거나 앱을 실행하고, 단말기 위치를 맞춰 인식하는 일련의 과정이 있죠. 하지만 결제 경험에서 중요한 것은 단순히 처리 속도가 아니라, 불필요한 조작 단계를 없애는 것입니다.\n시중의 모든 결제 수단을 분석한 결과, 결제 수단을 혁신하기 위해서는 크게 등록과 결제 과정의 불편함을 줄여야 했어요. 결제 수단으로서 ‘얼굴’은 시공간 제약 없이 누구나 쉽게 휴대폰으로 인증 및 등록할 수 있고, 결제할 때는 별다른 도구 없이도 결제할 수 있다는 점에서 이전의 경험과는 다른 가치를 줄 수 있을 것이라 확신했습니다.\nQ. 토스가 FacePay(페이스페이) 제품을 만드는 원동력이 있다면 무엇일까요?\nA. 사람들이 ‘이미 카드와 휴대폰 결제도 너무 충분히 편하지 않아?’라고 생각했을 때, ‘더 나아갈 수 있는 방법이 있지 않을까’하고 고민하는 게 토스의 DNA이고, 그런 점에서 유저들에게 훨씬 차별화된 가치를 줄 수 있을 것이라 믿고 있습니다. ‘왜 이렇게까지 해?’ 라는 이야기를 들을 때가 있는데, 사람들을 이롭게 할 것이라는 회사와 제품의 이 비전이 옳다고 믿고, 즐겁게 기꺼이 하는 동료들이 있기 때문에 더욱 힘이 나는 것 같아요.\n🙂\n토스가 ‘얼굴’을 \n이야기하는 이유\n\n7인의 전문가가 각자의 자리에서 건넨 언어는 달랐지만, 결국 하나의 의미로 이어집니다. 얼굴은 곧 ‘나’이며, 개개인의 고유성이 담긴 정체성 그 자체라는 점입니다. 토스는 페이스페이를 통해 이 고유성의 힘을 편리하고 안전한 결제 경험으로 만들고 있습니다.\n그런 의미에서 오리지널 필름 〈The Power of FACE〉에서는 얼굴이 지닌 본질을 묻습니다. 더 나아가 인간의 고유성을 이해하려는 시도를 담았습니다. 7인의 전문가가 각자의 언어로 발견한 얼굴의 의미를, 토스는 하나의 문장으로 압축하고자 합니다.\n‘얼굴, 그 힘을 마주하다’\n여러분에게 얼굴은 어떤 의미인가요? \n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 유서진 Graphic 이은호 이제현",

NASA 전시관에서도 ‘2030년대 화성 유인 탐사.’라는 문구를 확인할 수 있었어요. 이제 화성 탐사는 막연한 공상의 영역이 아니라, 국가 공식 기관의 장기 계획 안에서 차근 차근 진행되고 있습니다.\n\n정부에서 민간으로\n: 산업 구조의 변화\n미국이 처음 NASA를 설립할 때만 해도 우주 산업의 목적은 돈이 아니었습니다. 경쟁국 소련의 인공위성 발사를 보고 ‘우리도 질 수 없다’며 시작한 것이 아폴로 프로젝트였으니, 수익성은 고려하지 않고 막대한 국가 예산을 쏟아부었죠.\n하지만 지금은 완전히 달라졌어요. 이제 우주는 ‘기업의 무대’가 됐습니다. 2024년 미국에서 발사된 로켓 169기 중, 140기를 쏜 것은 스페이스X*였습니다. 민간 기업이 산업의 주도권을 가져간 겁니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 일론 머스크가 설립한 민간 우주기업\n\n기업이 산업을 주도하면 이익을 내야 한다는 명확한 목적이 생깁니다. 어떻게 하면 이익을 늘릴까, 비용을 더 줄일 순 없을까 끊임없이 고민하죠.\n스페이스X의 로켓 발사 비용은 약 7,000만 달러입니다. 1969년 유인 달 착륙에 쓰인 로켓 ‘새턴’ 발사 비용의 현재 가치(15억 달러)로 비교하면 20분의 1 수준이죠. 여기에 스페이스X가 개발 중인 ‘로켓 재사용 기술’까지 상용화된다면, 이 비용은 40분의 1까지 줄어들 수 있다고 합니다.\n비용이 낮아지면 기회는 커집니다. 스페이스X는 위성을 자주 쏘아올리며 ‘스타링크(저궤도 위성통신)’ 사업을 본격화했고, 덕분에 2020년대 들어 흑자로 돌아섰습니다.\n\n미국 출장에서 만난 현지 기업들 역시 우주를 새로운 성장 동력이자 ‘다음 시장’으로 보고 있었습니다. 안보 정보를 분석하는 CACI 인터내셔널(CACI)은 위성통신과 우주 방호 등 관련 기업들을 잇따라 인수하며 사업 영역을 넓히고 있었고, 레이도스 홀딩스(LDOS)는 사이버보안 전문 기업임에도 아예 우주 전담팀을 신설해 대응에 나서고 있었죠.\n소련에서 중국으로\n: 경쟁 상대의 변화\n우주 산업의 주도권이 민간으로 옮겨갔다고 해도, 우주는 여전히 국가 간 패권 경쟁의 무대입니다. 냉전 시절에 미국의 경쟁 상대가 소련이었다면, 지금은 중국으로 바뀌었을 뿐입니다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n“우주에 미국이 존재하는 것만으로는 충분하지 않다. 미국이 우주를 지배해야 한다. 다른 나라가 미국을 앞서나가는 것은 용납할 수 없다.”.css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n2018년 국가우주위원회 회의에서 트럼프 대통령이 한 말에서도, 미국 정부가 우주 패권을 중요하게 여기고 있음을 알 수 있습니다.\n이제 경쟁의 양상도 달라졌습니다. 누가 먼저 가느냐의 경쟁을 넘어, 누가 우주 질서를 만들 것이냐의 경쟁으로요. 미국과 중국은 ‘우주 지배’를 위해 각자 연합을 맺은 나라들과 공동 전선을 형성하고 있습니다.\n미국은 ‘아르테미스 협정’을 중심으로 56개국과 연합을 맺었어요. 아르테미스 협정에는 우주 탐사에서의 평화적 이용, 투명한 데이터 공유, 자원 활용 및 우주 보호 등의 질서가 규정되어 있죠. 중국은 러시아, 남아공 등과 함께 2035년까지 달 과학 연구기지 건설을 추진한다는 목표를 세웠습니다.\n광물 자원이라는 경제적 이익도 무시할 수 없습니다. 특히 달에는 희토류가 풍부한 것으로 알려져 있죠. 희토류는 IT 기기, 전기차, 배터리에 필수적인 자원입니다. 현재 전 세계 생산의 70%를 담당하는 중국과, 이를 견제하려는 미국의 경쟁은 더욱 치열해지고 있습니다.\n투자자에게 중요한 포인트\n그렇다면 투자자 입장에선 어떻게 접근해야 할까요?\n첫째, 우주는 더 이상 먼 미래가 아닙니다.\n아르테미스 2호 발사로 달 탐사가 재개되고, 미·중 경쟁이 격화될수록 우주에 대한 관심도 높아질 거예요. 둘 다 지금 당장 벌어지고 있는 일들이죠. 우주 산업이 현재의 투자처가 될 수 있다는 뜻이에요. 실제로 방위산업 기업처럼 이미 관련 산업군에서 수익을 거두고 있는 경우도 존재합니다.\n둘째, 우주 산업 투자의 시야를 넓혀야 합니다.\n우주 산업이라고 하면 가장 먼저 떠오르는 로켓 발사나 우주 여행은 비용이 워낙 커서 당장 돈을 벌기는 쉽지 않아요. 대신 우주 산업이 커지면서 함께 성장할 분야를 주목해야 합니다. 스페이스X의 스타링크 사업 같은 분야가 대표적이죠.\n셋째, 장기적 성장성만 믿고 방치해서는 안됩니다.\n상업화 관점에서 우주 산업은 아직 ‘태동기’에 불과합니다. 상황은 언제든 급변할 수 있고, 뉴스 하나에 촉망받던 기업의 주가가 크게 출렁일 수도 있어요. 그러니 장기 성장성이 높다고 무작정 사서 묻어두기보다는, 꾸준한 관심과 포트폴리오 점검이 필요해요. ETF 같은 간접 투자를 활용하는 것도 좋은 방법이 될 수 있습니다.\n\n💡 다음 글 예고\n\n다음 편에서는 텍사스에 직접 방문해 느낀 ‘성장 에너지’에 대해 전해드리려고 합니다. 이번 출장을 통해 ‘미국은 지금도 1등이지만, 앞으로도 계속 성장하겠다’라는 느낌을 받았습니다. 현장에서 직접 경험한 생생한 이야기로 다시 찾아뵙겠습니다. 감사합니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter 한상원 애널리스트 Edit 기명균 윤동해 Graphic 하정윤 최서윤",
