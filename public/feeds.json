Kakao Pay leverages Kotlin with Spring for backend development across various services, including its insurance offerings. Check out Kakao Pay’s story to see how Kotlin helps it address the complex requirements of the insurance industry and enables the reliable development and operation of services.\nNote: At Kakao Pay, each employees have their own nicknames to represent themselves. They address each other by calling their nickname instead of the actual name. Kuyho Chung, the writer of this post, uses ‘katfun.joy’ as his nickname.\n\n\n\n\nkatfun.joy, a backend developer at Kakao Pay, uses Kotlin to develop stable backend services. In this post, he introduces some of Kotlin’s most impressive features, such as value validation object creation, safe null handling, utility library creation using extension functions, and efficient unit tests, based on direct usage experience.

There are many good examples, so take a look!\nari.a: Why does Kakao Pay use Kotlin for the backend development of its services? For those curious, we recommend Katfun’s Kotlin use case!\nGetting Started\nHello. I am Katfun, and I develop and operate services such as insurance comparison recommendations and car management services at Kakao Pay Insurance Market department.\nAt Kakao Pay, we use Kotlin for backend service development, including for our insurance services and various other services.\nBefore joining Kakao Pay, I had no experience with Kotlin, but as I used it, I became captivated by its convenience and various advantages. For example, here are some of Kotlin’s charms.\nUsing Kotlin allows us to make the services we operate more robust, stable, and efficient.\nWe easily gathered and managed content for specific domains or created libraries exclusively for our services.\nWriting test codes with clear purposes and targets was also easily done through Kotlin.\nAfter joining Kakao Pay and developing and operating several services with Kotlin, I wanted to introduce the charm of Kotlin that I experienced firsthand. Of the many great things about Kotlin, I have focused on four of its key charming aspects. This is a particularly good read for backend developers interested in developing stable web services, like me.\nCreating objects with validated values at creation\nWhen creating a VO(1) representing a value, there are cases where input values need to be transformed or validated. Although validation logic can be separated into a different class, if you have to call the validation logic separately each time, there is a possibility of skipping validation by mistake. Here is an example of concise code that guarantees validation using various Kotlin features.\nIn this VO representing a car number, we use Kotlin’s value class.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber(val input: String)\nA value class is a wrapper class for representing values in Kotlin. It can only have a single immutable field, and in the JVM environment, the class is unwrapped during compilation and replaced with its internal value. Thanks to this, primitive type values can be handled like objects, and it also solves the overhead problem of using wrapper classes. For more details, please refer to the Project Valhalla content in the References section.\nLet’s assume the following rules for license plate numbers (car numbers).\nSpaces aren’t allowed\nThe car number format must be one of the following\n\n12가1234\n123가1234\n서울1가1234\n서울12가1234\nWhen creating a CarNumber instance, we want to remove the spaces and implement the following criteria:\nThe region name must be from the given list (Seoul, Gyeonggi, Daejeon, etc.), otherwise, an exception occurs.\nIf there is no region name, the first number must be 2–3 digits, and the last number must be 4 digits.\nIf there is a region name, the first number must be 1–2 digits, and the last number must be 4 digits.\nThis was added as validation in the factory method.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        private val CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"(\\\\d{2,3})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\")\n        private val OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"^([가-힣]{1,2})?(\\\\d{1,2})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\\$\")\n        private val LOCATION_NAMES = setOf(\"서울\", \"부산\", \"대구\", \"인천\", \"광주\", \"대전\", \"울산\", \"경기\", \"강원\", \"충북\", \"충남\", \"전북\", \"전남\", \"경북\", \"경남\", \"제주\")\n\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpaces())\t// Remove spaces\n        }\n    }\n\n    init {\n        validateCarNumber(value)\n    }\n\n    private fun validateCarNumber(number: String) {\n        val oldCarNumberMatch = OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matchEntire(number)\n        if (oldCarNumberMatch != null) {\n            val (location, _, _) = oldCarNumberMatch.destructured\n            require(location in LOCATION_NAMES) { \"Unknown registration region.\" }\t// Exception occurs if the region name of the old car number is not in the list\n        } else {\n            require(CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matches(number)) { \"Please check the car number format.\" }\t// Exception occurs if it does not match the car number forma\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the code may seem a bit complex, the steps are as follows.\nCall the CarNumber.from() factory method to remove hyphens and spaces.\nInvoke the logic during instance creation using the init { } block.\n\nVerify whether it matches one of the two regular expressions (new car number, old car number).\nIf it is an old car number, check whether the region name is in the list.\nThe regular expressions (regex) and region names used for validation are written in the companion object and used as a singleton.\nDoes writing the code like this solve all the problems? Unfortunately, there is still the issue of the constructor being exposed.\nval carNumber = CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\") // Exception occurs because spaces are not removed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the constructor is called directly, the space removal process created in the factory method cannot be applied. Fortunately, it is possible to prevent the constructor from being called directly. You can add the private constructor access modifier to it.\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n\n\n\n\nBy adding private constructor, you can enforce the creation of CarNumber instances only through the factory method. However, this implementation may be somewhat unfriendly to CarNumber users. Users may attempt to create an instance using the constructor like CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\"), but until they write the code, they won’t know that the constructor is blocked with private and that they need to use the factory method like CarNumber.from(\"123 가 4567\") instead.\n\n\n\n\nThis can be resolved by overloading Kotlin’s invoke operator. Kotlin provides guidance that “function-type values can be called using the invoke operator”.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        // ...\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpacesAndHyphens())\n        }\n\n        operator fun invoke(carNumber: String): CarNumber = from(carNumber)\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage example\nval carNumber = CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\")\t// Actually calls from instead of the constructor.\n\n\n\n\nThis allows users to create CarNumber instances as if they are directly calling the constructor, but internally, it hides the call to the factory method from.\nIn some cases, the factory method from can also be hidden with private. This makes it so users no longer need to worry about whether to use the constructor or the factory method when creating a CarNumber instance. At the same time, it also prevents the creation of CarNumber instances with broken consistency.\nFinally, when using Jackson for serialization and deserialization, add the @JsonCreator annotation to the from factory method to use it. This completes a VO that satisfies all intended conditions. Below is the final completed CarNumber class.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        private val CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"(\\\\d{2,3})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\")\n        private val OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"^([가-힣]{1,2})?(\\\\d{1,2})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\\$\")\n        private val LOCATION_NAMES =\n            setOf(\"서울\", \"부산\", \"대구\", \"인천\", \"광주\", \"대전\", \"울산\", \"경기\", \"강원\", \"충북\", \"충남\", \"전북\", \"전남\", \"경북\", \"경남\", \"제주\")\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpacesAndHyphens())\n        }\n\n        operator fun invoke(carNumber: String): CarNumber = from(carNumber)\n    }\n\n    init {\n        validateCarNumber(value)\n    }\n\n    private fun validateCarNumber(number: String) {\n        val oldCarNumberMatch = OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matchEntire(number)\n        if (oldCarNumberMatch != null) {\n            val (location, _, _) = oldCarNumberMatch.destructured\n            require(location in LOCATION_NAMES) { \"Unknown registration region.\" }\n        } else {\n            require(CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matches(number)) { \"Please check the car number format.\" }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing code like the example above in Kotlin, you can create VOs for various values and perform validation and transformation before instance creation. Writing the code this way allows you to delegate all roles and responsibilities related to car numbers to the VO. If policies related to car numbers change, you only need to check the CarNumber class. This naturally prevents unintended values from being used as car numbers and helps create stable services.\nExample\nLet’s take a closer look with a simple example. There is an API that receives input from users as shown below. If you declare the carNumber field in the request class as a CarNumber VO instead of a string, an exception will be immediately raised when the API is called with a car number that does not meet the conditions. There is no need to call separate validation logic, and if a CarNumber instance is successfully created, it guarantees that the car number value is valid.\n@RestController\nclass CarController {\n    @PostMapping(\"/car\")\n    fun carInformation(@RequestBody request: CarInformationRequest) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\ndata class CarInformationRequest(\n    val carNumber: CarNumber\n)\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring null safety\nKotlin provides various ways to handle null safely. Here’s an example of one that helps with writing and understanding logic through immutability and smart casting(2)\nThere is a retryLogic method that resends an existing request. It performs the following actions:\nExplore the retryUseCase that matches the received category code.\n– Throw an exception if not found.\nSend a retry request using the found retryUseCase.\nThe code is as follows:\nfun retryLogic(\n    categoryCode: CategoryCode,\n    transactionId: String,\n    request: RetryRequest\n) {\n    val retryUseCase: UseCase? = activeUseCases().firstOrNull { it.type == categoryCode }\n    requireNotNull(retryUseCase) { \"The retry request is currently unavailable.\" }\n\n    // Separate business logic\n\n    return retryUseCase.getPrice(transactionId, request)\n}\n\n\n\n\nval retryUseCase is a value of type UseCase?. This indicates that the value could either be a UseCase or null. In Kotlin, unless you explicitly specify that the value’s type is nullable by adding a ? after it, the value cannot hold null by default.\nNext, perform a null check on the received value. The commonly used method is to check for nullability using if.\nif (retryUseCase == null) throw IllegalArgumentException(\"The retry request is currently unavailable.\")\n\n\n\n\nIn Kotlin, you can write the exact same functionality using a contract called requireNotNull.\nEven after checking for nullability, the problem is not completely resolved. If the value changes in the middle after the null check, then even if you previously checked for null on retryUseCase, you cannot be certain that it is still not null. In the above code, this is represented as the ‘separate business logic’ section.\nThe reason Kotlin is particularly strong in this area is because of Kotlin’s immutability. Values are declared using either val or var, and values declared with val are immutable. In other words, once a value is assigned, it does not change. This also applies when checking for null; once a value is confirmed to be not null, it is guaranteed to remain not null. In the example above, after requireNotNull(retryUseCase), the value is guaranteed not to be null.\nThis is also confirmed from a Kotlin language perspective through smart casting.\n\n\n\n\nThrough smart casting, the Kotlin compiler treats the type of retryUseCase as UseCase rather than UseCase? after requireNotNull(retryUseCase). The green-highlighted part in the image above represents this. Thanks to this, when writing or debugging code, you can confirm that a value that could be null is not null and proceed with the logic with confidence. This is, of course, a great help in the stable operation of services.\nCreating a utility library using extension functions\nSeveral utility codes are commonly used in the development of insurance services. In particular, there are many cases where something is manipulated for primitive type fields or strings. These were gathered to create a library called insurance-common.\nKotlin’s extension functions and object declarations can be used in the creation of such a library. Kotlin’s extension functions allow you to extend methods without separate design patterns or the inheritance of specific classes. Object declarations are used to contain content independent of the state of a specific instance. At the language level, they are declared as singletons, which is good for preventing the unnecessary creation of the same content multiple times.\nFor example, a method called maskingName is written to mask the corresponding code when a specific pattern is found in strings.\nprivate val maskingNameRegex = Regex(\"(?i)Name=[^,)]++[,)]\")\n\n/**\n* Masks numbers surrounded by \"Number=\" and \",\" or \")\" in a string, except for the first digit\n*/\nfun maskingName(input: String): String {\n    return input.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n}\n\n// Usage example\nval maskedValue = maskingName(userName)\n\n\n\n\nIf the above code is refactored using Kotlin’s extension functions, it can be modified as follows.\nfun String.maskingName() = this.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n\n// Usage example\nval maskedValue = userName.maskingName()\nThe masking method was extended to the string class. This method is unrelated to the state of a specific instance. In other words, declaring it as a singleton(3) and reusing it is advantageous for resource management. It can be used as a singleton by using a Kotlin object declaration.\nobject StringUtils {\n    private val maskingNameRegex = Regex(\"(?i)Name=[^,)]++[,)]\")\n\n    /**\n     * Masks strings surrounded by \"Number=\" and \",\" or \")\", except for the first character\n     */\n    fun String.maskingName() = this.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExamples of its usage can be confirmed through unit tests.\n@DisplayName(\"Masks strings surrounded by Number= and , or ) except for the first character\")\n@Test\nfun maskingName() {\n    // given\n    val name = \"Kim Chun-sik\"\n    val text = \"userName=$name, result=\\\"success\\\"\"\n    val lowerText = \"name=$name, result=\\\"success\\\"\"\n\n    // when\n    val result = text.maskingName()\n    val lowerResult = lowerText.maskingName()\n\n    // then\n    val expectedMaskedResult = \"Kim*\"\n\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(\"userName=$expectedMaskedResult, result=\\\"success\\\"\")\n    assertThat(lowerResult).isEqualTo(\"name=$expectedMaskedResult, result=\\\"success\\\"\")\n    }\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, functions used throughout the insurance service are being turned into libraries. This has reduced duplicate code across multiple ongoing projects and allowed their use without any performance degradation or other drawbacks. All of this is thanks to Kotlin’s extension functions and object declarations. Code managed this way is easy to read and maintain, greatly aiding in service operation.\nSimple and efficient unit testing using data classes\nWhen writing unit tests, data classes can be useful for setting up situations for testing. A data class in Kotlin is, as the name suggests, a class for representing data. Unlike regular classes, equals() and hashCode() are redefined, and other methods like copy() are automatically generated. Using data classes is useful when writing classes that represent data, such as DTOs(4).\nThis is an example of a DTO that needs to be tested.\ndata class UserInformation(\n    val name: String,\n    val age: Int,\n    val birthDate: LocalDate,\n    val address: String,\n    val gender: Gender,\n    val isDisplay: Boolean\n) {\n    enum class Gender {\n        MALE,\n        FEMALE;\n    }\n\n    init {\n        require(age >= 18)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to test whether age validation works. If the age is 18 or older, no exception should be thrown, and if it is under 18, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown. Here’s one way to write the test:\nclass WhateverTest() {\n    @Test\n    fun `Throws IllegalArgumentException if age is under 18`() {\n        assertThrows {\n            val userInformation = UserInformation(\n                name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n                age = 17,\n                birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n                address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n                gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n                isDisplay = true\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `Does not throw exception if age is 18 or older`() {\n        assertDoesNotThrow {\n            val userInformation = UserInformation(\n                name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n                age = 18,\n                birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n                address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n                gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n                isDisplay = true\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDo you see the problem?\nThe target of the test is unclear.\nUnnecessary code is repeated.\nIt is difficult to determine from the test code above which values in UserInformation contribute to the exception. Adding comments could partially resolve this, but if the DTO has dozens of fields, it would be hard to identify which fields have comments at a glance. Additionally, to create a UserInformation instance, appropriate values must be assigned to fields other than age.\nTo address this, the copy() function of the data class can be used. copy() has the following characteristics:\nA completely identical data class instance is created. When compared with the original instance using equals(), they are considered equal.\nWhen calling copy(), you can specify values for parameters. In this case, only the specified values of the corresponding parameters are copied.\nReturning to the code above, let’s separate the common parts and revise it to make the test target clearer.\nclass WhateverTest() {\n    @Test\n    fun `Throws IllegalArgumentException if age is under 18`() {\n        val invalidAge = 17\n        assertThrows {\n            val userInformation = successUserInformation.copy(age = invalidAge)\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `Does not throw exception if age is 18 or older`() {\n        val validAge = 18\n        assertDoesNotThrow {\n            val userInformation = successUserInformation.copy(age = validAge)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val successUserInformation = UserInformation(\n        name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n        age = 28,\n        birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n        address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n        gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n        isDisplay = true\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere are the two versions of the code arranged side by side for comparison.\n\n\n\n\nDo you notice the difference? Using copy():\nReduced repeated code.\nClearly highlighted the target affecting the test.\nThis lowers the barrier to writing tests and improves their readability. As a result, tests can better serve as documentation, and they can be used to write stable services. This is also valid when writing tests in a BDD(5) style, such as given-when-then or arrange-act-assert.\nConclusion\nAs someone responsible for the server side of our system, my priority is building services that are stable, readable, and scalable. Since I started using Kotlin two years ago at Kakao Pay, I’ve been able to meet these goals step by step while developing a variety of applications.\nI wrote this blog post to share my experience in the hope that it helps others build and operate reliable backend systems.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Imagine you are proud of yourself for creating an amazing Java application, framework, or a library. You open one of its source files to make some changes and this is what you see:\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collector;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWiteLock;\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime;\n// more import statements\nWhile looking at this long list of imports, are you wondering why you need to know the name of every single class or interface used in your class (apart from its configuration)? It seems like a cognitive load to me. Most of the developers I know collapse this section in their IDE and don’t bother expanding it.\nThe business logic in this source file probably starts after line twenty. Can you do something about it because importing packages won’t help much. Don’t worry, Module Import Declarations can help address this import hell for you.\nWhat is ‘Module Import Declarations’?\nIntroduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and a production feature in Java 25, Module import declarations enable you to import an entire module using a single import statement. In the above example, you can replace all the import statements with the following line of code, since all those packages are defined as part of the java.base module:\nimport module java.base.*;\nYes, just one line of code. The source file can now use List, Map, Stream, Path, and many more classes. As a developer, you no longer need to think about which package they live in. With this single statement, you can import all of the packages exported by the module java.base.\nWhy should you care about this feature?\nApart from the obvious benefits of concise code and escaping from the import hell, this feature helps us developers focus on solving business problems rather than finding the fully qualified names for classes or interfaces to use. Do you think it is worth your time to find out whether the interface Function is defined in the package java.util.function or java.util?. An intelligent IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA helps you to get around it by adding the relevant imports as soon as you use a type in your code (more about it in a later section in this blog post).\nIt offers convenience for new developers. Imagine you are a new Java developer. Would you prefer having an umbrella import statement so that you need not be bothered about knowing which package defines the commonly used data structures, such as List, Map, or Stream? If you are teaching Java, talking about importing classes interfaces from packages before folks get comfortable using basic data structures could make them lose focus. It would be better for them to get started writing programs that use List and Stream, rather than having them figure out which Java package defines them. Module import declarations help beginners focus on learning Java without getting confused or frustrated by things they don’t need to worry about yet.\nIt enables faster prototyping. When we are prototyping, we try to get things to work as quickly as possible. In such cases, an umbrella import statement, such as the import module declaration, lets us jump straight into coding. It also keeps the code concise, cleaner and easier to read when we are using large APIs. But this doesn’t imply that you should define your code in a module to use a module import statement.\nBefore moving forward, let’s cover the IntelliJ IDEA configurations for using this feature.\nIntelliJ IDEA Configuration\nImport Module declaration was introduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and IntelliJ IDEA has supported this feature since version 2024.3. In soon to be released Java 25, it becomes a production feature (it is now a permanent language feature, and safe to use in your production code). \nJava 25 is scheduled to be released in September 2025. To use this feature as a production feature (without needing the --enable-preview flag during compilation and runtime), you should download the early access version of JDK. You can also do this from IntelliJ IDEA’s settings dialog (Yes! IntelliJ IDEA allows you to download and configure EA versions of the JDK):\n\n\n\n\nIn your Project Settings, set the SDK to Java 25. For the language level, select ‘X – Experimental features’ on both the Project and Modules tabs. This enables you to use all Java 25 features, including those currently under review. Java 25 is due to be released in September 2025, and we at JetBrains are working on adding more support. New language options will be accessible in IntelliJ IDEA soon.\nMore about Module Import Declarations\nKnowing why we need a feature is the first step to using it. Let’s look at how to use it and also answer some frequently asked questions from developers about this feature.\nSyntax of Module Import Declarations\nThe syntax is simple. It starts with the keyword import, followed by module and the name of the module (without a wildcard, that is, *):\nimport module java.base.*;\nThis feature doesn’t work with unnamed modules. Revisit the syntax of this feature: it requires you to name the module you want to import. The example in this section imports the java.base module. \nHow to determine the fully qualified name of types in your source code?\nAre you wondering how to determine the fully qualified name of a type or variable in your source code when using import module declarations? This was one of the main reasons for using individual imports in source files. This applies to all types of imports, including wildcard and static imports.\nMove your cursor to the type in a variable declaration and use the Quick Documentation feature (Ctrl+Q for Win/Linux, or F1 on macOS) to view a documentation popup that shows the package name at the top, followed by the name and its documentation—without having to open another source file in your editor window. You can also use the Quick Definition feature (Ctrl+Shift+I) to view the fully qualified name, along with the definitions of its members, in a popup window. Alternatively, you can hover over the type using your mouse to view the fully qualified name.\n\n\n\n\nOn a separate note, if you don’t like showing Quick Documentation popups on mouse hover, you can clear the ‘Show quick documentation on hover’ checkbox in the settings (find it using Shift+Shift). If you want to browse the source code of the used type, use the ‘Go to Declaration or Usages’ feature (Ctrl+B / Cmd+B), which opens the source code in a new editor window.\nIn the next section, let’s see how to use the import module statement with different libraries or APIs.\nHow to import JUnit 3.8.1 using import module declaration?\nI know it is an old version, but it is still around and in use. How would you import classes and interfaces defined in JUnit 3.8.1 (if you had to) in your source files? To import it using an import module declaration, you must use its module name. The short answer is you cannot because there is no module name for it. JUnit 3.8.1 was created before Java 9 introduced modules.\nWhat about other libraries? How do we find their module names? We usually use build tools, such as Maven, to import dependencies as jar files. If a dependency supports modules, its jar file includes module-info.class (mandatory for modules), which contains the module name. You’ll notice that the JUnit 3.8.1 jar doesn’t include module-info.class.\nIntelliJ IDEA users can view module info in External libraries, in the Project Structure window, as  shown below:\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you could ask the AI Chat window in IntelliJ IDEA how to find these module names.\nWhich packages are exported by the modules you import?\nEach module defines a module-info.java file that includes information about the packages that module exports to all modules or to specific other modules. \nLet’s try to understand this by checking out what happens when you import the module java.base using IntelliJ IDEA. Click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut (Go to Declaration or Usages) and you could view the definition of this module to find out all the modules exported by this module. This is shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nThe public API in these packages are available to source files that import these modules.\nWhat do you mean by on-demand import?\nDevelopers often argue about importing a single class or interface versus importing all public entities by importing a package using a wildcard character. Which of these do you think is better?\nWhen you import a module or a package using a wildcard (*), you import types on demand. This means you can use any public class, interface, or entity from a package or module without importing each one individually.\nOften, developers ask if importing a full module increases the size of their .class files. The short answer is no. On-demand imports make all public classes and interfaces in the module available to use in a source file, but the compiler includes only those that are actually used in your code.\nName conflicts (compilation error)\nWhen you import one or more modules, it is possible that packages within the same module or across modules define classes with the same name. For an example, in the example code below, code at line number 5 (Date date;) won’t compile because importing java.base module makes java.util.Date class available, and importing the java.sql module makes java.sql.Date available:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3. \n4.    public class NameConflicts {\n5.        Date date;  // compilation error\n6.    }\nLet’s assume you want to use the Date class from module java.sql. To address this issue, you could either add a single import statement, as follows:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3.    import java.sql.Date;\n4.    \n5.    public class NameConflicts {\n6.        Date date;  \n7.    }\nYou could also resolve it by using a fully qualified class name, as follows:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3. \n4.    public class NameConflicts {\n5.        java.sql.Date date;  \n6.    }\nIntelliJ IDEA can highlight name conflicts as you type your code. Invoke context actions to view a list of qualified class names (package name + class name) to choose from, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are wondering whether it is a good idea to import modules since it could lead to namespace conflicts, these issues can occur with importing packages too. Don’t worry; it results in a compilation error and can be fixed easily.\nAlso, a module and one of the packages it includes can have the same name. Notice that the module java.sql contains a package java.sql. The fully qualified name of a class or an interface includes its package name, not the name of the module the package is defined in.\nCompact Source Files integration\nGavin Bierman mentioned that the idea of this Import Module Declarations came up while the Java team was working on JEP Compact Source Files and Instance main Methods, which aim to reduce the ceremony to learning Java. \nCompact source files implicitly import the module java.base. It implies that the new developers can use any public class or interface from the multiple packages exported by the java.base module, without explicit import statements.\nJShell Integration\nOne of the main benefits of using JShell is that it allows you to quickly evaluate expressions, execute code statements or snippets (and much more) without the ceremony of defining classes.\nPrior to Import Module Declarations, JShell automatically imported the ten most used packages (and java.lang) so that developers could easily use those classes or interfaces without explicit import statements. However, you still need import statements for classes or interfaces not defined in these packages, such as the LocalDateTime class from the package java.time:\n\n\n\n\nWith import module declarations, JShell automatically imports the module java.base. This helps developers use many more classes (such as LocalDateTime), without needing explicit import statement, as shown in the following image:\n\n\n\n\nOne import statement to use the entire standard Java API\nBy importing the java.se module you can use the entire standard Java API in your source file. Here’s the module information for this module:\n\n\n\n\nThe java.se module is an aggregator module. It does not export any package, but requires other modules transitively. In other words, source files importing java.se import the packages exported by modules that are marked required transitive in java.se.\nInterview with creators of this feature\nWe also interviewed the owner of this feature, Gavin Bierman, Programming Language Designer at Oracle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGavin mentioned that this feature was co-developed with the JEP Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods. He covered the differences between single-type imports and type-import-on-demand declarations, explaining what they are and why individuals and organizations prefer one style over the other. He also talked about how the “Module Import Declarations” feature automatically imports on demand from transitive dependencies of modules. He discussed ambiguous imports and how to deal with them, name ambiguity, and how to submit relevant feedback on this feature to the teams at OpenJDK.\nPractical Tips\nPractical tips and wisdom are always useful when using a feature.\nMigrating your codebases to use import module declarations\nI’d recommend not replacing all the individual import statements or package statements with import module statements in your codebase. Try module imports in new files or when you’re already touching existing code.\nThis feature is syntactic sugar; it makes your code more readable but doesn’t offer any performance benefits. The folks who maintain your code are more important than using the latest shiny features in your codebase. If they understand the code in its existing format, respect that.\nGroup Your Imports\nWith module imports, Java offers multiple types of imports, such as, importing modules, importing packages, importing classes/interfaces, and static imports of fields or methods. Grouping imports could make them more readable.\nIntelliJ IDEA supports importing types as you type them\nWhether you are copy-pasting code or typing it, IntelliJ IDEA adds the relevant imports to your codebase, either automatically or by prompting you to select the correct version to import, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nJust in case, the preceding settings don’t work for you, ensure you have enabled the relevant import settings in ‘Intentions’ (use IntelliJ IDEA Settings), as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t been using this feature in IntelliJ IDEA, you are missing out on a great user experience.\nSummary\nIntroduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and a production feature in Java 25, Module Import Declarations allow importing an entire module with a single import statement.\nApart from the obvious benefits of replacing multiple import statements with a single import, this feature helps us developers escape import hell. It works only with named modules, not unnamed ones or older libraries without module definitions (such as JUnit 3.8.1). Classes and interfaces are imported on demand. Importing a module makes its public classes/interfaces available, but only those actually used are included by the compiler. Importing multiple modules might lead to class name conflicts, requiring specific imports or fully qualified names.\nJShell and compact source files automatically import java.base with this feature. If you want to extend it, try importing the java.se module, which provides access to the entire standard Java API. The release of Java 25 is scheduled for September, but IntelliJ IDEA already supports this feature. Try it out and let us know your feedback.\nHappy coding.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The concept of remote development is deceptively simple: spin up your development environment somewhere that’s not your local machine. The perks range from freeing up local resources to not panicking when your laptop gets stolen.\nYet, there are plenty of pitfalls, including flaky setups, poor visibility, and lousy monitoring. Let’s look at some best practices of remote development and see what JetBrains has to offer.\n1. Get rid of RDP/VNC/VDS\nIf you’re still “remote developing” by pixel-streaming, you’re wasting your time. Real remote development feels local, handles flaky networks gracefully, and scales far beyond your laptop.\nReality check: Streaming your whole desktop is like lugging a cinema projector over SSH. Every keystroke triggers massive pixel redraws, your IDE becomes sluggish, and one lost packet freezes everything. Why move video frames instead of code diffs? Modern remote protocols only send keystrokes and UI deltas. Latency plunges, and your IDE snaps back to life.\n2. Stay online, even when you’re not\nFlaky Wi-Fi isn’t an excuse anymore. A proper remote development client buffers your edits locally, shows a “reconnecting” notice, and pushes your changes when you’re back online. Linting, inspections, breakpoints – they pick up seamlessly. You keep context, and your work never vanishes into thin air.\n3. Enterprise-grade orchestration\nOne VM or container remotely? Sure, great for demos. But ten teams? A dozen projects? Manual SSH scripts crumble fast. You need a Cloud Dev Environment (CDE) orchestrator that addresses the following pain points:\n\nPain PointHand-Rolled SSH/Docker/VMCDE Orchestrator (e.g., CodeCanvas)\nResource scalingStatic, brittleAuto-scale, auto-stop, snapshots\nEnvironment drift“Works on my machine”Versioned templates, pre-built images\nProvisioningManual installsPre-warmed toolchains, secrets, plugins\nSecurityOpen SSH risksZero-trust relays, jump servers, air-gapped lockdown\nVisibilityDark – no metricsDashboards for usage, health, failures\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not automating this stuff, you’re putting your team at a disadvantage.\n4. CodeCanvas: JetBrains’ answer\nWe built CodeCanvas to cover every base:\nDev environment templates: Versioned, shareable, based on Docker images (build your own if needed), IDE backends included.\nAuto-provisioning: Plugins, VS Code extensions, secrets – everything installs itself.\nCost control: Idle workspaces auto-stop, warm-up snapshots and standby pools minimize startup delays.\nZero-trust security: WebSocket relays (no inbound pods), SSH jump servers as needed, and strict clipboard restrictions.\nObservability: Real-time dashboards to monitor environment creation, adoption rates, crashes, and idle times.\n5. Borrow, don’t reinvent – follow the leaders\nGitHub Codespaces: Uses devcontainer.json, spins up on GitHub’s infrastructure.\nGitpod: Declares workspace configuration via .gitpod.yml, provides consistent branch environments.\nCoder: Brings developers and AI coding agents together in secure self-hosted environments on your infrastructure.\nCodeCanvas: Scalable Kubernetes-based environments (EKS, AKS, GKE, or your bare-metal clusters) designed for distributed teams.\nIf you’re building your own, ask yourself: what do these platforms handle that I’m missing?\n6. Workflow orchestration beats task automation\nCreating a VM is just a task. Combining container builds, secret management, post-hooks, health checks, and cleanup – that’s orchestration. True CDE platforms handle this complexity gracefully. If you’re still scripting “docker run” in shell scripts, you’re reinventing the wheel.\n7. Short-lived environments are mandatory\nIf you try to cram everything into a single long-living environment, you’ll just be stuck twiddling your thumbs during branch switches and rebuilds. When environments spin up in seconds, they become disposable. This allows a fresh environment for each feature or code review, tossed away as soon as you’re done with it. Warm-up snapshots and standby pools have turned “cold start” into a thing of the past. Short-lived CDEs ensure consistency, security, and predictable costs.\n8. Security and compliance: don’t get pwned\nZero trust: Authenticate and authorize every single IDE connection.\nNetwork isolation: Use per-cluster relays and jump servers with no direct SSH. Restrict clipboard actions to prevent data leaks.\nPolicy enforcement: Align your practices with security benchmarks – development environments are vulnerable if left unguarded.\n9. Metrics that actually matter\nDashboards aren’t just window dressing – they drive optimization. Get an overview of:\nStartup latency: From spin-up to first build or indexing.\nResource utilization: CPU, memory, and I/O per workspace.\nIdle time: Triggers for auto-shutdown.\nFailure rates: Backend crashes, reconnections.\nUse tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Dynatrace, or cloud-native monitoring to correlate developer efficiency with infrastructure health.\n10. AI agent support – no longer optional\nYour CDE orchestration now has to treat AI agents like first-class citizens, not just humans. That means clean APIs, bulletproof permissions, and tight resource controls. Mistakes here mean you’ll find yourself quickly outdated in a landscape where AI isn’t optional anymore.\nBottom line\nIf you’re clinging to RDP, VDI, manual SSH hacks, or one-off VMs, you’re consciously choosing friction over productivity. Embrace protocol-smart remote dev clients, short-lived environment orchestration, zero-trust security, and meaningful metrics. Whether you adopt CodeCanvas, Coder, Codespaces, Gitpod, or AWS Cloud9 – these patterns aren’t optional if you care about scale, security, and developer velocity.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Progress Or Perfection? Staying Quality-Focused as a Team Under Pressure\nQodana Leadership Series: An interview with Vladislav Minaev and Konstantin Ulitin.\n\n\n\nEveryone from growth-mindset gurus to Agile die-hards talk about ways in which we can iterate as developers. Release an MVP, build as you go, “minimize waste, maximize value” to stay lean, and do it all while prioritizing user feedback. \nBut as much merit as these principles have, what is the biggest price we pay for doing things quickly and in stages? Some research suggests code quality and maintainability in the long term suffers when teams deliver new iterations too quickly – a sentiment that’s echoed by software development author Martin Fowler. \nSo, with this in mind, what does it take to find balance in a team that maintains one of the most popular IDEs in the world? We turned to Vlad (WebStorm Team Lead) and Konstantin (WebStorm Tech Lead) for some answers.\nIn your experience, what’s the biggest obstacle to defining ‘code quality’ within a development team? How do you tailor this definition to the JavaScript community specifically?\nVlad: Code quality is already subjective, and different devs have different backgrounds and personal preferences. Definitions of “clean” and “quality” can vary, especially from one ecosystem to another. In full-stack projects, where JavaScript parts are placed alongside the backend, developers have the ability to change code outside of their primary ecosystem. This can create friction, particularly when developers from the backend world start to engage in areas they’re less familiar with. This applies to frameworks as well. \nHow have you seen subjective interpretations of ‘good code’ lead to conflict or inefficiencies?\nOne particular example is when code reviews turn heated because reviewers have different opinions on naming, architectural choices, etc. Feedback loops can sometimes become more about personal preference. This can take time and affect output and maintainability.\nCan you share an example of a time when different team members had significantly different ideas about what constituted ‘high-quality code’ and how it impacted the project?\nI’ve noticed that it’s not necessarily just about code coverage – it’s a broader issue. In many cases, it comes down to code reviews and the different approaches to development. Each approach has its own strengths. One is very structured, involving detailed planning, feature design, and documentation. It’s a more analytic method. \nThe other is highly iterative, practical, and focused on implementing ideas quickly and adjusting on the fly. Rather than doing extensive upfront analysis, this approach favors immediate action. There’s no right or wrong here – both can work well depending on the context.\nSometimes, the structured approach pays off in the long run, especially when working with complex codebases that require collaboration between multiple developers. In these situations, a careful, well-documented process can be really beneficial. On the other hand, when it comes to building user-facing functionality, the choice between a documented versus agile process often depends on business needs. For example, in an MVP or startup environment, the main goal is usually to deliver results quickly – especially when deadlines are tight or events are coming up. In these cases, speed can sometimes outweigh quality.\nThat said, developers are often tightly aligned with business needs, and there are plenty of cases where skilled engineers, committed to code quality, find their priorities clashing with business demands. It really depends on the nature of the project. If you’re working on something long-term that will need ongoing support and evolution, enforcing quality standards is definitely valuable. But if you expect to frequently revisit or rework the code, strict standards might not always be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do you handle situations where strong opinions or ‘ego’ get in the way of establishing consensus on code quality standards?\n\nI can’t say that I have a silver bullet here, because as a manager, you can’t simply “fix people.” \nThe smarter approach is to try and harness their strengths. For example, if someone has a strong opinion, it might be helpful to assign them a specific part of the system or a dedicated project. That way, you’re matching their personality to the project. But sometimes, tension is unavoidable. What we can do is try to spark discussions and facilitate open dialogue. We can also collaborate on common practices, like code reviews.\nFor instance, we reviewed our code review practices with the WebStorm team. Konstantin can provide more technical details on that, but it was one of the artifacts.\nThe discussion was intense. It’s not simple. In real-life scenarios, you might have a strong tech lead who can enforce a clear vision, and if the rest of the team is aligned, it’s easy to agree on strict rules. But that’s not always the case. In larger teams, you’ll often have several high-level, passionate developers who each have strong opinions, and those differences can lead to conflict. Connecting those people is a really tough process.\nKonstantin: In addition to what Vlad said, I think it’s important for developers to have some freedom in the specific areas of code they’re responsible for. Common code quality standards are needed because everyone is working on the same codebase and reading their colleagues’ code, but also it’s important to have a feeling of ownership. As everyone works on the same codebase together, they naturally find common ground regarding standards.\nHave you ever had to mediate a conflict related to code quality standards? If so, what approach did you take?\nVlad: It’s crucial as a team leader to provide a safe and comfortable environment for people to share their opinions, but sometimes these discussions can lead to tense dialogues, and we have definitely experienced this. As a tech leader, you should default to the technical agreements in your team rather than focusing on personal preference and sometimes speak to your team members in private. For example, you can have a separate conversation and use phrases like “I really value your contribution” and “Thanks for a constructive and productive conversation” – sincerely, of course. \nA good example of this is applying overly strict code coverage and linting rules directly in the editor, which can be counterproductive. Pursuing exact code coverage numbers is often unnecessary and ineffective. I doubt there are exact numbers, as they vary related to the nature of the project. In some cases it leads to really weird constructions to test pieces of code, and people struggle and spend a lot of time doing that instead of moving forward with features. Being flexible on code coverage metrics is good because restrictions like 80 or 90 percent code coverage  might not work well, and things like this need to be discussed. \nI guess that’s also very tough. So one solution might be automated checks?\nIn our case, the IntelliJ department says you can’t push your changes into master if they don’t pass zero tolerance inspections (provided by Qodana), which are Java inspections followed by a comprehensive suite of tests. So yes, that can be one solution.\nHow important is documenting code quality standards, and what’s the best way to make them accessible and understandable to the entire team?\nIt depends on the project. If you’re working together with one developer, it’s easy enough to just communicate verbally. But other situations might call for the opposite approach. Imagine a huge open-source project with a bunch of external contributors. In that case, it’s crucial to create some sort of contribution guide and to access project resources. \nHow do you ensure that code quality standards are regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving project needs and best practices?\nIn practice, code quality standards are often revisited reactively, typically after an issue arises. It’s not something most teams schedule weekly or even annually. For open source projects, this often happens after the first few pull requests, when contributors submit code that doesn’t meet unstated expectations. If quality checks aren’t automated through CI tools at that point, it’s a clear signal that they need to be introduced.\nIf you anticipate a project will be long-running, it’s best to define and implement standards from the start. Experience plays a big role here. You start to recognize what’s necessary early on.\nIf I were to start a new project, especially in the open-source space, I’d make a point to study similar projects. I’d look at how their CI pipelines are structured, what tools they use (like Docker for isolation), and what quality gates they’ve implemented. That research often inspires improvements I bring into my own projects. It’s a continuous learning process driven both by necessity and by observing best practices in the wider development community.\nHow do you tailor code quality standards to the specific context of a project or tech stack?\nThe structure and architecture of a project play a significant role in shaping code quality standards. For example, in large monorepos or distributed systems composed of multiple microservices across separate repositories, integration testing often becomes more valuable than unit testing alone. You need to align your testing strategy and broader quality standards with the scale, structure, and operational requirements of the system.\nWhat works for a small library may not make sense for a large-scale, service-oriented architecture. Tailoring standards means considering not just the tech stack but also how the code fits into the overall architecture and deployment model.\nWhat code quality metrics do you find most valuable, and why?\nWhile metrics like cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index, and code coverage have their place, it’s important not to over-rely on any single one, especially code coverage. High coverage doesn’t always mean high-quality tests.\nStatic analysis tools are incredibly valuable because they catch issues early, often before code is even run. Even for small or personal projects, setting up basic static checks in a CI pipeline is worth the effort. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab make this easy, and these checks help enforce a consistent baseline of quality, especially when you’re likely to forget to run them manually.\nIn short, I prioritize metrics that contribute to early detection of issues and long-term maintainability, rather than just hitting arbitrary numerical targets.\nQodana can help you prioritize code quality while you iterate\nThanks for reading this installment of the Qodana Leadership Series.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re introducing a few changes to YouTrack prices, which will take effect on October 1, 2025. \nWhat’s not changing\nYouTrack remains free for teams of up to 10 users. \nHelpdesk projects remain free for teams of up to 3 agents with unlimited reporters. \nThe full feature set, support, and AI Assistance continue to be included at no additional cost with the YouTrack subscriptions. \n\n\n\n\nWhat will be changing\nAll active upgrade and support subscriptions will continue to work until the expiration date. \nYou can renew your subscription at the current pricing, but only until October 1, 2025. \nAfter October 1, any renewal or addition of users/agents will be at the new prices. \nRead on to learn about the reasons for this change, how to prepare, and what it means for YouTrack Cloud and Server customers.\nWhy are we making this change?\nOur current pricing has remained unchanged since 2020. In fact, many long-time customers have been using YouTrack under legacy pricing introduced more than a decade ago, with full access to all features.\nSince then, we’ve added significant value – Knowledge Base, Helpdesk functionality, AI Assistance, apps, and much more. The new prices reflect these enhancements and our continued investment in YouTrack.\nWe’re grateful to the teams that have chosen YouTrack over the years. This update will help us continue to improve YouTrack Cloud and Server for small teams and large enterprises alike.\nHow to prepare \nHere’s what license administrators need to know to plan ahead:\nYour existing Cloud or Server subscription will work at the current price until its expiration date. No immediate action is required on your side. \nHowever, you can renew early at the current pricing. This is only possible one last time until October 1, 2025.\nAfter that date, all renewals and user/agent additions will be at the new prices.\nBelow are details depending on your subscription type.\nUpdates for YouTrack Cloud Customers\nYouTrack Cloud per-user subscriptions\nIf you started using YouTrack Cloud in 2020 or later, you most likely have a per-user subscription. Here’s what the price change means for your team.\nYouTrack will continue to be free for teams of up to 10 users – no changes here. \nIf your team has more than 10 users, subscription prices will be adjusted starting October 1, 2025. For monthly plans, the new pricing starts at USD 5.40 per user per month. If you prefer an annual subscription, you’ll get two months free – the new starting price will be USD 4.50 per user per month. The larger your team, the lower your price, thanks to discount increasing as you add users. You can explore updated pricing examples in our FAQ.\nHelpdesk functionality remains fully included with your subscription. It stays free for teams with up to 3 support agents and unlimited reporters. For teams with 4 or more agents, new pricing will apply: USD 6 per agent per month with a monthly plan, or USD 5.50 per agent per month with an annual plan.\nAll features – including AI Assistance and support – continue to be part of the subscription at no extra cost. We’re also keeping all our discounts for startups, non-profits, educational institutions, and open-source projects.\nYouTrack Cloud legacy user-pack subscriptions\nIf you’ve been using YouTrack Cloud since before 2020 and haven’t switched to the per-user billing model, you may still be on a legacy plan with user packs. \nThese subscriptions will continue to work as usual until their expiration date, even after October 1, 2025. There’s no immediate action required on your side.\nHowever, this will be the last opportunity to renew under your current pricing. If you’d like to extend your subscription one more time on legacy terms, you can do so only until October 1, 2025. After that, renewals will require switching to the new per-user pricing.\nTo make this transition easier, we’re offering three extra months free when you switch to an annual per-user subscription. \nThis plan gives you access to more flexibility and features than legacy plans could offer:\nYou’ll be able to add or remove users as needed – no fixed-size user packs.\nYou’ll also get more cloud storage – 3 GB per user.\nYou gain access to Helpdesk projects, starting with 3 agents free and unlimited reporters.\nThe new per-user pricing will take effect on October 1, 2025. After that date, monthly plans will start at USD 5.40 per user, and annual plans at USD 4.50 per user, with increasing discounts as your team grows. You can check our FAQ for examples to estimate your cost.\nAs always, the full set of features, support, and AI assistance are included at no extra charge. Discounts for startups, educational and non-profit organizations, and open-source projects will remain available.\nUpdates for YouTrack Server customers \nIf you’re using YouTrack Server, here’s what will and won’t change starting October 1, 2025.\nWhat’s not changing\nYouTrack Server will remain free for teams of up to 10 users – no changes there. \nIf you’ve purchased a license, you still own it: all existing YouTrack Server licenses are perpetual and will continue to work. Your current upgrade and support subscription will also remain valid until its expiration date.\nAs always, every active subscription includes the full feature set, support, and AI Assistance at no additional cost. Discounts for startups, non-profit and educational institutions, and open-source projects remain unchanged.\nWhat will be changing\nYou can still extend your subscription at the current pricing, but only until October 1, 2025. After that, all renewals and the addition of new users or agents will be available only at the new prices.\nWe’ll continue to offer flexible user pack options, starting from 15 users and scaling up through 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and more. After October 1, 2025, these will be offered only at the new pricing.\nIf your team is larger than 2,000, feel free to reach out to the YouTrack team to get a custom quote.\nRenew and save 50%\nIf your support subscription is still active – or expired less than 12 months ago – you can renew it at 50% of the new license price. We’ll continue offering this renewal discount going forward.\nIf more than a year has passed since the expiration of your subscription, the discount no longer applies, but you can still purchase a new license and continue using YouTrack Server with all your data intact.\nHelpdesk prices\nHelpdesk projects remain free for 3 agents and unlimited reporters. \nStarting October 1, 2025, for teams with 4 or more agents, the price will be USD 72 per agent per year.\nNeed help?\nWe are always here to support you.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Fourteen years ago, Dropbox took its first steps toward building its own hardware infrastructure—and as our product and user base has grown, so has our infrastructure. What started with just a handful of servers has evolved into one of the largest custom-built storage systems in the world. We've scaled from a few dozen machines to tens of thousands of servers with millions of drives.\nThat evolution didn’t happen by accident. It took years of iteration, close collaboration with suppliers, and a product-first mindset that treated infrastructure as a strategic advantage. Now we’re excited to share what’s next: the launch of our seventh-generation hardware platform, now featuring Crush, Dexter, and Sonic for our traditional compute, database, and storage workloads, and our newest GPU tiers, Gumby and Godzilla. To make this leap possible, we dramatically increased storage bandwidth, effectively doubled our available rack power, and introduced a next-gen storage chassis designed to even further minimize vibration and heat.\nThis generation represents our most efficient, capable, and scalable architecture yet—and it’ll help us as we continue to build and scale helpful AI products like Dropbox Dash. Below, we’ll walk you through how we designed the latest version of our server hardware as well as key lessons we’ll carry into generations to come.\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019c63112e617513c94_AtlasGrotesk-Medium-Web-vfl38XiTL.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 500;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019711b648fd1ccd24a_AtlasGrotesk-Regular-Web-vflk7bxjs.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 400;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n.xf-content-height {margin: 0;}\r\n#cta { font-family: AtlasGrotesk,sans-serif; font-size: .900rem; text-decoration: none; background: #f7f5f2; line-height: 1.69; box-sizing: border-box;}\r\n#cta-box { padding: 15px 20px 15px 20px; }\r\n#cta-hed {font-weight: 500;}\r\n#cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #1e1919; padding-left:20px;}\r\n#cta a:link, #cta a:visited  {text-decoration: none;}\r\n#cta p { margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; }\r\n\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta {background: #000;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-box {border: 1px solid; border-bottom: 0;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #f7f5f2;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark .button {background: #000;}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n    background-color: #1e1919;\r\n    color:  #f7f5f2;\r\n    height: 2.5rem;\r\n    padding: 10px 5px 10px 20px;\r\n    font-size: 1rem;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    line-height: 1.2;\r\n    transition: all .3s;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button:hover { background-color: #0061ff; }\r\n\r\nimg {vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px 1px 2px 0px;}\r\n\r\n.c17-plain-html {margin-bottom: 50px}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Dropbox Dash: Find anything. Protect everything.\n\r\n\r\nFind, organize, and protect your work with Dropbox Dash. Now with advanced search for video and images—plus generative AI capabilities across even more connected apps.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSee what's new →\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n    \nDeveloping our strategy\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTo understand how we got to where we are today, it’s helpful to understand how we built the infrastructure foundation on which Dropbox runs. Back in 2015, we relocated all US customer data from off-premises hosts to on-site ones. The Magic Pocket team executed a massive migration project, bringing the bulk of Dropbox’s file storage into our own custom-built infrastructure. Over 90% of the roughly 600PB of data we stored at the time was moved into data centers we managed ourselves—a turning point that enabled better performance, cost control, and scale.\nIn the years following, we continued to grow—a lot. We ramped from 40PB of storage in 2012 to over 600PB by 2016. And today, we’re in our exabyte era, running on semi-custom hardware that we’ve designed to meet the unique needs of our platform. Along the way, we introduced new technologies such as SMR drives, which allow for higher storage density, and GPU accelerators for AI and compute-heavy tasks. And we’ve co-designed both hardware and software to serve our evolving workloads.\nSo, before committing to any designs for our seventh-generation server hardware, we set some high-level goals that drew from both what we’d learned from previous generations and opportunities from the latest hardware advancements in the industry. Three primary themes shaped our approach:\nEmbracing emerging tech\nInfrastructure hardware is evolving fast. CPUs are getting more powerful with higher core counts and better performance per core. AI workloads are growing rapidly. Networks are moving toward faster speeds like 200G and 400G. And a new band of storage areal density has finally arrived. We used this moment to guide our strategy, aiming to harness these trends to improve our performance, efficiency, and scalability.\nPartnering with suppliers\nStrengthening these relationships also continues to give us a strategic edge: We get earlier access to emerging technology, deeper hardware customization, and a more stable platform. \nDesigning with software in mind\nWe brought in our software teams early to find out what would actually move the needle for their services. That led to goals like packing more compute power into each rack, enabling GPU support for AI and video processing, and improving speed and responsiveness for our database systems. Co-designing was a central theme; we weren’t just designing servers, but building platforms that elevated our services.\nAll of these goals converged around a central question: How big of a leap do we want to make, and what technologies will help get us there? Instead of maxing out everything just because we could, we focused on what matters most: better performance per watt, higher rack-level efficiency, and unlocking the right features to support our next chapter.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1736\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d3d2769c-eb9f-495a-bf58-48c76d953541:Diagram 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1736\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d3d2769c-eb9f-495a-bf58-48c76d953541:Diagram 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nDropbox seventh-generation hardware\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \n A look under the hood of our next-gen hardware\n\r\n\r\n\n\nPerformance\nMaximizing system throughput at the server and rack level\nReducing latency of individual processes\nImproving price-performance for Dropbox workloads\nEnsuring balanced I/O and memory bandwidth \nWe ran tests using SPECintrate (a benchmark for multi-threaded workloads) and compared how each chip stacked up in performance per watt and per core.

At the heart of that upgrade was a shift from the 48-core AMD EPYC 7642 “Rome” processor to the 84-core AMD EPYC 9634 “Genoa.” This shift delivered some big gains:\n75% more cores per socket (48 cores → 84 cores), improving bin packing for containerized services\n2x the memory capacity (256GB → 512GB), boosting memory-heavy workloads\nDDR4 → DDR5, delivering higher bandwidth \n25Gb → 100Gb networking, aligning with growing internal traffic\nNVMe gen5, speeding up local disk access and system boot times\nWe did all of this while keeping the same compact 1U “pizza box” server design, allowing 46 servers per rack, with no extra space needed.\nDatabases\nOn the database side, we focused on boosting CPU performance. While our new Dexter platform keeps the same number of cores as the previous generation, it packs a punch with 30% more instructions per cycle (IPC) and an increased base frequency (from 2.1GHz to 3.25GHz). The shift from dual-socket to single-socket design also reduced delays from inter-socket communication. These upgrades led to up to 3.57x less replication lag—the delay between when data is written to a primary system and when it’s copied to a secondary one—which made a huge difference for high-demand workloads like Dynovault and Edgestore.\nEarly on, we realized our database and compute platforms had a lot in common when it came to requirements. That opened the door for us to use the same platform from our system vendor for both. Consolidating like this helped us simplify our support stack, making it easier to manage components, firmware, drivers, and OS updates. The result was a versatile, dual-use platform that removed key scaling bottlenecks without sacrificing density or efficiency.\nStorage\nFinally, on the storage front, our design goals evolved to keep pace with increasing drive capacities. As drives get bigger—some now hold over 30TB—we had to think ahead. One of our internal performance standards is 30Gbps per PB of data. But with future systems expected to push past 100Gbps, we aimed even higher: 200Gbps throughput. \nWe also reworked our SAS topology to evenly allocate bandwidth to each drive and provide total system bandwidth past 200Gbps. And since this scale demanded stronger networking, we teamed up with our network engineering team to design a new 400G-ready data center architecture.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Thermal and power architecture\n\r\n\r\n\n\nUpgrading to higher-core CPUs meant we had to rethink our approach to thermal and power management. Across the board, we saw power demands rise, so we needed a smarter way to stay within the limits of our existing data center infrastructure. First, we set a cap on processor thermal design power (TDP) to make sure we could pack in as many cores per rack as possible without blowing past our cooling or power budget.\nRather than taking worst-case “nameplate” power measurements—manufacturer-listed maximums that often overestimate real usage—we modeled real-world system usage. The models showed our servers could draw over 16kW per cabinet, which would’ve been a dealbreaker under our old 15kW per-rack power budget. To make it work without overhauling our entire power infrastructure, we teamed up with our data center engineering team and made a major change: We switched from two PDUs to four PDUs per rack, using existing busways and adding more receptacles.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1880\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"61fd1d7e-48bd-4888-936e-768831b0f915:Image 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1880\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"61fd1d7e-48bd-4888-936e-768831b0f915:Image 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nSeventh-generation compute and storage (left); quad PDUs to meet higher power requirements (right)\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nThis move effectively doubled our available rack power, giving us the breathing room to support current loads—and even future accelerator cards. Finally, we also worked closely with suppliers to improve airflow, upgrade heatsink designs, optimize fan curves, and test thermals under full-load conditions. It was a full-stack effort to keep things cool and efficient.\nFocus on storage\nOur storage strategy is all about getting more out of the same physical space. We’ve steadily increased the capacity of our traditional 3.5” hard drives from around 14TB to over 30TB in just a few years. This density improvement brings benefits: For one, it lowers cost per terabyte—and also reduces power usage per terabyte.\nHowever, higher densities also heighten sensitivity to acoustic and vibrational interference. And for Dropbox, since over 99% of our storage fleet uses shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology—which packs data in even tighter—the margin for error is razor-thin.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1748\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"459549f7-af28-4379-bc78-2a38bde3b4ac:Diagram 2.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1748\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"459549f7-af28-4379-bc78-2a38bde3b4ac:Diagram 2.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nDropbox continues to leap up to the next available areal density curve\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nHere’s the challenge: the read/write head inside these drives operates with nanometer precision. Even a tiny vibration can knock it off track. And when you’ve got fans spinning at over 10,000 RPM to cool a dense server, vibrations (and noise) can quickly stack up. That leads to something called a position error signal (PES)—and, in the worst case, a write fault that forces the drive to retry. That slows things down, increasing latency and reducing IOPS.\nAt the same time, we need that airflow to keep the drives cool. They operate best at around 40°C—and if things get too hot, drives age faster and error rates rise. This means we’re constantly balancing two opposing forces: cool enough to perform, quiet enough to be precise. To solve this, we co-developed our next-gen storage chassis with the system and drive suppliers. The key features we focused on were:\nVibration control: Acoustical isolation and damping \nThermals: Improved fan control and airflow redirection \nFuture-proofing: Compatibility with the next generation of large-capacity drives\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1800\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"688\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5188b6b9-ce1b-46a0-92f6-c9e3a6c3f3c8:pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1800\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"688\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5188b6b9-ce1b-46a0-92f6-c9e3a6c3f3c8:pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nRedirecting high-velocity air to augment cooling\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nThat work paid off. We were one of the first to adopt Western Digital’s Ultrastar HC690, which provides up to a 32TB SMR drive that fits 11 platters into a standard 3.5” casing. That’s more than a 10% bump in capacity compared to the last generation. \nLeveling up with GPUs\nTo support Dash, our universal search and knowledge management product, it was clear we needed to bring GPUs into the mix. Features like intelligent previews, document understanding, fast search, and video processing (plus more recent work with large language models) all require serious computing muscle. \nThese workloads demand high parallelism, massive memory bandwidth, and low-latency interconnects—requirements that traditional CPU-based servers can’t economically support. So as part of our seventh-generation hardware rollout, we introduced two new GPU-enabled server tiers: Gumby and Godzilla.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1680\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"fcf1e5ff-5a64-4481-b585-38cc69097c36:Diagram 3.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1680\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"fcf1e5ff-5a64-4481-b585-38cc69097c36:Diagram 3.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nGPU generations\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nGumby builds on our Crush compute platform but adds support for a wide range of GPU accelerators—hence the flexible name. It’s designed for flexibility, with support for TDPs ranging from 75W to 600W as well as both half-height half-length (HHHL) and full-height full-length (FHFL) PCIe form factors. Gumby is optimized for lightweight inference tasks like video transcoding, embedding generation, and other service-side machine learning enhancements.\nGodzilla is built for big jobs. It supports up to 8 interconnected GPUs, delivering the performance required for LLM testing, fine-tuning, and other high-throughput machine learning workflows.\nTogether, Gumby and Godzilla allow Dropbox to scale AI across our products while maintaining control over performance, cost, and energy efficiency.\nAcross compute, storage, and accelerators, we pushed performance while staying true to our principles: build right-sized, cost-efficient, and optimized systems tailored to our needs. This isn’t just next-gen tech—it’s hardware shaped by how Dropbox actually works.\n\r\n\r\n    \n What we learned along the way\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThermals and power are the new bottlenecks\nNo matter where we looked—compute, storage, or GPU platforms—one thing was clear: power demands are going up. To keep performance scaling, we had to rethink everything from airflow patterns to how power gets delivered at the rack level. That’s what led us to move from two to four PDUs per rack. The result? We can now support more power-hungry, high-density systems without compromising stability or performance. And while overall rack power increased, power consumption per petabyte and per core decreased, helping us stay on track with our sustainability goals.\nSupplier collaboration accelerates innovation\nSome of our biggest hardware wins came from teaming up early with suppliers. Whether it was redesigning hard drive acoustics, fine-tuning chassis layouts, or getting early access to cutting-edge components, collaboration made a huge difference. Instead of waiting for off-the-shelf solutions, we co-developed hardware that fits our needs—like vibration-optimized storage enclosures and systems that are ready for the next generation of storage technology.\nTaking a product-first approach pays off\nThe GPU tier is a prime example of where hardware strategy followed software needs. As AI-powered tools like Dash came online, we engaged early with our machine learning and video teams to understand what was needed. That early input helped us build platforms designed specifically for inference, video processing, and hosting large language models. This product-first mindset ensured the infrastructure was ready the moment the software needed it.\n\r\n\r\n    \nConclusion\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWith our seventh-generation rollout, we’ve made our in-house server hardware more strategically valuable than ever. Our latest Crush and Dexter platforms are powered by cutting-edge CPUs that give us a big lift in performance—especially when it comes to IPC and transaction speed. On the storage side, we worked closely with vendors to develop Sonic, a new system that supports higher capacities. And as demand for AI products continues to grow, we introduced a dedicated hardware tier built specifically for these workloads. \nLooking ahead, we’re already gearing up for the next wave of infrastructure change. Technologies like heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) promise huge capacity gains, and they’ll require us to get even more precise with acoustic and thermal management. Similarly, liquid cooling is transitioning from niche to necessity as compute densities continue to climb.\nThis generation of infrastructure isn’t just about meeting today’s challenges—it’s a launchpad for what’s next. We’ve built tightly integrated platforms optimized for Dropbox, strengthened our supplier partnerships, and created the flexibility to keep evolving. The next generation is already underway.\nSpecial thanks to Jesse Lee and Refugio Fernandez, who also contributed to this story.\n~ ~ ~\nIf building innovative products, experiences, and infrastructure excites you, come build the future with us!

Firefly, DALL·E, Midjourney는 익숙하지만, Google Labs에 조용히 숨어있는 진짜 강력한 도구가 있습니다. 바로 'ImageFX'입니다. 이 글에서 그 놀라운 성능과 활용법, 프롬프트 예시까지 모두 확인해보세요!\n미드저니 대체 무료 AI? 구글 ImageFX 잠재력과 프롬프트 완전 정복\n\n\n \n 다양한 AI 이미지 생성기를 사용해 보셨을 겁니다. 화려한 기능과 광고 속에서 어떤 걸 써야 할지 고민될 때가 많죠. 저도 그랬으니까요. 그런데 최근에 우연히, 마치 비밀 연구소에 숨겨진 보물처럼 조용하지만 강력한 성능을 자랑하는 도구를 발견했습니다. 바로 구글의 ImageFX입니다. 과대광고 없이, 오직 결과물로만 이야기하는 이 도구에 대해 솔직한 후기를 공유해 드릴게요.  \n \n구글의 숨겨진 보석, ImageFX ✨\n구글이 AI 분야의 강자라는 건 모두가 아는 사실이지만, 이상하게도 ImageFX는 전면에 나서지 않습니다. 이 도구는 구글의 가장 실험적인 프로젝트를 선보이는 'AI Test Kitchen'의 일부로, 홈페이지에서 직접 찾아 들어가야만 만날 수 있죠. 하지만 일단 사용해보면, 왜 구글이 자신감을 가졌는지 알 수 있습니다.\nImageFX는 구글의 최신 모델인 Imagen 3를 기반으로 작동합니다. 다른 AI들이 화려하고 예술적인 스타일에 집중할 때, ImageFX는 '사실감'과 '정확성'이라는 기본에 충실합니다. 놀라운 점은 유료 요금제나 광고 없이 이 모든 기능을 무료로 제공한다는 것이죠.\n \nImageFX 시작하기: 5단계 완전 정복  ‍ \n\"그래서 어떻게 사용하는 건데?\" 하고 궁금해하실 분들을 위해 준비했습니다. 구글 계정만 있다면 누구나 단 5단계 만에 전문가 수준의 이미지를 만들 수 있습니다. 아래 가이드를 따라 차근차근 시작해보세요.\n단계별 ImageFX 사용 가이드  \n사이트 방문: http://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx\nImageFX 선택 및 로그인: 화면에 보이는 여러 실험 도구 중 'ImageFX'를 선택하고, 본인의 구글 계정으로 로그인합니다.\n프롬프트 입력: 만들고 싶은 이미지에 대한 설명을 텍스트 입력창에 자유롭게 입력합니다. (예: \"해변에서 책을 읽고 있는 골든 리트리버\") : 최적의 결과를 위해서는 영문 프롬프트를 권장합니다.\n프롬프트 칩으로 다듬기: 프롬프트를 입력하면 하단에 [Cinematic], [35mm film], [Minimalist] 등 다양한 스타일의 '칩'이 나타납니다. 원하는 칩을 클릭하여 결과물을 더 세밀하게 다듬어 보세요.\n결과 확인 및 다운로드: 잠시 기다리면 4개의 이미지가 생성됩니다. 마음에 드는 이미지를 클릭하여 더 크게 보고, 다운로드 버튼을 눌러 저장하면 끝!\n \nImageFX 맞춤 프롬프트, 이렇게 써보세요! ✍️\nImageFX의 진정한 힘은 '현실 세계를 묘사하는' 프롬프트와 만났을 때 발휘됩니다. 추상적인 단어보다는 구체적인 상황, 조명, 재질을 묘사하면 훨씬 더 사실적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다. 아래 예시들을 참고하여 여러분만의 프롬프트를 만들어보세요.\n  인물 사진 프롬프트\nPrompt: A close-up portrait of an elderly female artisan meticulously painting pottery, her face shows intense concentration. Soft window light illuminates her grey hair and workshop. Shallow depth of field.\n(한글: 나이 든 여성 장인이 도자기에 세심하게 그림을 그리는 클로즈업 인물 사진. 그녀의 얼굴에는 깊은 집중력이 드러난다. 부드러운 창가의 빛이 그녀의 흰머리와 작업실을 비춘다. 얕은 피사계 심도.)\n\n\n \n ️ 풍경/배경 프롬프트\nPrompt: A wide-angle shot of a quiet library with towering wooden bookshelves filled with old books. sunbeams shining through a large arched window, dust particles floating in the air. Warm and nostalgic tones.\n(한글: 오래된 책으로 가득 찬 높은 나무 책장이 있는 조용한 도서관의 광각 사진. 커다란 아치형 창문으로 햇살이 들어오고, 공기 중에는 먼지 입자가 떠다닌다. 따뜻하고 향수를 불러일으키는 톤.)\n\n\n \n ️ 자연의 섬세함 \nPrompt: A photo focused on the wing of a butterfly resting on a colorful flower. The delicate patterns and textures of the translucent wing shimmer in the sunlight. Soft background blur, vivid colors, shallow depth of field. \n(한글: 화려한 꽃 위에 앉아있는 나비의 날개에 초점을 맞춘 사진. 반투명한 날개의 섬세한 무늬와 질감이 햇빛에 비쳐 반짝인다. 부드러운 배경 흐림, 생생한 색감, 얕은 피사계 심도. .)\n\n\n \n ️ 아늑한 실내 풍경 \nPrompt: A cozy and peaceful scene of a cat sleeping on a rocking chair next to a warm fireplace, covered with a fluffy blanket. The firelight gently illuminates the cat's fur. Realistic texture, warm and inviting tones. \n(한글: 따뜻한 벽난로 옆, 푹신한 담요가 덮인 흔들의자에 고양이 한 마리가 잠들어 있다. 벽난로의 불빛이 고양이의 털을 부드럽게 비추고 있다. 아늑하고 평화로운 분위기, 사실적인 텍스처.)\n\n\n \n☕ 사물/제품 프롬프트\nPrompt: A macro photograph of a steaming cup of black coffee on a rustic wooden table. A single drop of condensation trickles down the side of the ceramic mug. hyper-realistic, high detail.\n(한글: 러스틱한 나무 테이블 위에 놓인 김이 나는 블랙커피 한 잔의 매크로 사진. 세라믹 머그잔 옆으로 응결된 물방울 하나가 흘러내린다. 극사실주의, 고화질.)\n\n\n\n \nImageFX, 이런 분들께 추천해요!  \nImageFX는 모든 사람에게 유용한 도구이지만, 특히 다음과 같은 분들께 강력히 추천합니다. 여러분의 작업 효율을 극적으로 높여줄 거예요.\n콘텐츠 제작자/마케터: SNS 게시물, 블로그 썸네일, 광고 소재 등 사실적인 이미지가 필요할 때 저작권 걱정 없이 빠르게 고품질 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n디자이너/기획자: 아이디어 구체화 단계에서 레퍼런스 이미지나 시안을 신속하게 제작하여 커뮤니케이션 비용을 줄일 수 있습니다.\n학생/연구원: 프레젠테이션, 보고서, 논문에 필요한 시각 자료를 비용 부담 없이 만들 수 있어 학업의 질을 높일 수 있습니다.\nAI 입문자/취미 사용자: 복잡한 설정 없이 직관적인 인터페이스와 '프롬프트 칩' 기능으로 누구나 쉽고 재미있게 AI 이미지 생성을 경험할 수 있습니다.\n \n유료 모델을 위협하는 사실감  \nAI 이미지의 '티'가 나는 결과물에 실망한 적 있으신가요? ImageFX는 조명, 재질, 구도 표현에서 놀라운 사실감을 보여줍니다. 마치 전문 포토그래퍼가 촬영한 사진처럼 말이죠.\n요소\nImageFX 표현력\n\n\n\n\n조명\n강한 조명, 부드러운 조명, 골든 아워 등 실제 빛의 느낌을 정확하게 재현합니다.\n\n\n재질\n유리의 투명함, 금속의 반사, 피부의 유기적인 질감을 사실적으로 표현합니다.\n\n\n구도\n별다른 지시 없이도 안정적이고 균형 잡힌 구도를 자동으로 만들어냅니다.\n\n\n\n⚠️ 물론 한계도 있어요!\n모든 도구가 완벽할 순 없겠죠. ImageFX는 로고나 간판처럼 이미지 속 텍스트 생성에는 약한 모습을 보입니다. 또한, 초현실적이거나 특정 작가의 화풍을 강하게 따라하는 스타일 표현에는 다소 제한적일 수 있습니다. 하지만 무료라는 점을 감안하면 기대 이상의 성능입니다.\n \n \nImageFX 핵심 요약\n✨ 압도적 사실감: 별도 보정 없이 바로 사용 가능한 사진 수준의 결과물\n  직관적인 사용법: 프롬프트 칩 기능으로 누구나 쉽게 아이디어 확장 가능\n  100% 무료:\n광고나 유료 플랜 없이 모든 기능을 무료로 제공\n✍️ 맞춤 프롬프트: 구체적이고 서술적인 프롬프트로 최고의 결과물 도출\n조용하지만 가장 강력한 무료 이미지 생성기, 지금 바로 경험해보세요.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: ImageFX는 정말 무료인가요?\nA: 네, 현재 ImageFX는 구글의 AI Test Kitchen을 통해 별도의 비용이나 구독 없이 무료로 제공되고 있습니다.\nQ: ImageFX로 만든 이미지의 상업적 이용이 가능한가요?\nA: 현재 구글의 공식 약관에는 상업적 이용에 대한 명확한 허용 지침이 나와 있지 않습니다. 따라서 중요한 상업적 프로젝트에 사용하기보다는 개인적인 실험이나 비상업적 용도로 사용하는 것이 안전합니다. 항상 최신 이용 약관을 확인하는 것을 권장합니다.\nQ: Midjourney나 DALL·E와 비교했을 때 가장 큰 차이점은 무엇인가요?\nA: 가장 큰 차이점은 '사실감'에 대한 집중도와 '프롬프트 칩' 기능입니다.

AI 서비스는 복잡한 시스템으로 이루어져 있기 때문에, 한 부분이 고장 나더라도 전체 서비스가 멈추지 않도록 설계하는 것이 정말 중요해요.\n기술적 안정성 확보 방안\n시스템 이중화 및 분산화: 서버, 네트워크, 데이터베이스 등 핵심 인프라를 여러 곳에 분산시키고 복제해서 한 곳이 고장 나도 다른 곳에서 대신 작동할 수 있도록 해야 합니다.\n클라우드 기반 자동 확장: 사용자가 몰리면 자동으로 서버 용량을 늘려주고, 트래픽을 여러 지역으로 분산시키는 기술을 적극 활용해야 해요.\n운영적 신뢰성 강화\n1) 정확한 원인 분석(RCA): 장애가 발생하면 왜 발생했는지, 무엇이 문제였는지 근본 원인을 파악하고 재발 방지 대책을 세워야 합니다.\n2) 주기적인 모의훈련: 실제 장애처럼 상황을 만들어서 직원들이 빠르고 정확하게 대응하는 훈련을 꾸준히 해야 합니다.\n→ 이런 노력들이 합쳐져야 서비스가 더욱 튼튼해지고, 사용자들도 안심하고 AI를 이용할 수 있겠죠!\n이번 챗GPT 장애 보상처럼 사후 대응도 중요하지만, 무엇보다 중요한 건 장애를 미연에 방지하고 발생하더라도 빠르게 복구할 수 있는 시스템을 갖추는 것이라고 생각해요. AI가 우리 삶의 필수적인 부분이 되어가는 만큼, 그 신뢰성은 무엇보다 우선시되어야 할 가치니까요.\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약 \n오늘은 챗GPT 서비스 장애와 오픈AI의 보상 소식, 그리고 앞으로 AI 서비스의 안정성을 높이기 위한 노력들에 대해 이야기해봤어요.\n \n \n챗GPT 장애 보상, 핵심 요약!\n✨ 주요 장애: 2025년 6월 10~11일, 챗GPT 및 OpenAI 서비스의 대규모 오류 발생.\n  보상 대상: 챗GPT 유료 멤버십 이용자 및 API 유료 고객.\n  보상 방식: 월 구독료의 약 6.4% 자동 환불 진행 (예: 22달러 구독 시 약 1.41달러).\n환불 금액 = 월 구독료 × (장애 시간 / 총 월 사용 시간)\n ‍  미래 대응: 실시간 모니터링, 시스템 이중화, 주기적 모의훈련 등으로 안정성 강화 예정.\n서비스 안정성은 AI 시대의 핵심 가치입니다.\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 챗GPT 장애 보상은 누가 받을 수 있나요?\nA: 챗GPT 플러스, 프로, 팀, 엔터프라이즈 등 유료 멤버십 이용자와 API 유료 고객이 보상 대상입니다. 무료 사용자에게는 보상이 제공되지 않습니다.\nQ: 보상을 받으려면 따로 신청해야 하나요?\nA: 아니요, 별도 신청 절차 없이 자동 적용될 예정입니다. 다만, 웹사이트나 앱스토어(Apple, Google Play) 결제 건은 필요시 각 경로로 개별 환불 신청이 가능합니다.\nQ: 보상 금액은 얼마나 되나요?\nA: 월 구독료의 약 6.4%가 환불되는 것으로 확인되었습니다. 이는 장애 발생 시간에 비례하여 계산된 것으로 보입니다.\nQ: 챗GPT 서비스는 지금 정상적으로 작동하나요?\nA: 네, 2025년 7월 2일 현재 챗GPT를 포함한 모든 오픈AI 서비스는 정상적으로 운영 중임을 오픈AI가 공식 안내했습니다.\nQ: 앞으로 이런 장애를 예방하기 위한 오픈AI의 노력은 무엇인가요?\nA: 오픈AI는 실시간 모니터링 시스템 고도화, 자동 복구 프로세스 마련, 시스템 이중화 및 분산화, 주기적인 점검 및 모의훈련 등을 통해 서비스 안정성을 강화할 예정입니다.\nAI 기술이 우리 삶의 깊숙이 들어온 만큼, 서비스의 안정성과 신뢰성은 그 무엇보다 중요한 가치가 되고 있어요. 이번 챗GPT 장애 보상처럼 사후 대응도 물론 중요하지만, 앞으로는 더 튼튼한 시스템으로 우리를 불편하게 하는 일이 없었으면 좋겠습니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "미국 대통령이 AI를 알게 되면 어떤 일이 벌어질까요? 어쩌면 이미 시작되었을지도 모릅니다. 최근 미국 연방정부 전체에 AI를 도입하려는 거대한 계획이 실수로 유출되면서, 정부의 AI 활용이 상상보다 훨씬 가까이 다가왔음을 보여주었습니다.\n미국 대통령의 AI 활용법, 유출된 'ai.gov'에서 엿보다\n\n\n요즘 어딜 가나 AI 이야기뿐이죠? \"오늘 점심 뭐 먹지?\" 같은 소소한 고민부터 복잡한 업무까지 AI가 해결해 주는 시대가 됐으니까요. 그런데 만약, 한 나라의 정부가, 그것도 미국 연방정부가 \"정부 전체를 AI 중심으로 바꾸겠다!\"고 선언한다면 어떨까요? 공상 과학 영화 같은 이야기 같지만, 최근에 실제로 벌어진 일이랍니다. 바로 미국 정부의 비밀 AI 프로젝트 'ai.gov'가 실수로 대중에게 공개된 사건이죠!\n \n실수로 드러난 비밀 프로젝트, 'ai.gov'\n사건의 발단은 아주 사소한 실수였습니다. 미국 총무청(GSA)과 기술 혁신 서비스(TTS) 팀이 개발 중이던 'ai.gov' 웹사이트의 소스 코드가 담긴 저장소가 인터넷에 잠시 공개된 것이죠. 매의 눈을 가진 누리꾼들이 이를 발견했고, 언론의 질문이 시작되자마자 해당 저장소는 빛의 속도로 사라졌습니다.\n이 프로젝트를 이끄는 인물은 TTS의 새로운 책임자, 토마스 셰드(Thomas Shedd)입니다. 그는 과거 테슬라에서 소프트웨어 통합 엔지니어링 관리자로 일했으며, 일론 머스크의 측근으로도 알려져 있습니다. 그가 정부에 합류하면서 내세운 비전은 바로 '정부 전체의 AI 우선 전략'으로, 연방 공무원들의 업무 대부분을 자동화하겠다는 야심 찬 계획을 가지고 있었죠. 유출된 자료에 따르면, 이 'ai.gov'의 공식적인 시작일은 바로 7월 4일, 미국의 독립기념일로 계획되어 있었습니다.\n알아두세요!\n이 프로젝트는 단순한 아이디어가 아닙니다. 'ai.gov'는 미국 정부 기관들이 실제 업무에 AI를 도입하기 시작하는 공식적인 허브 역할을 할 예정입니다. 즉, 정부의 디지털 전환이 새로운 국면을 맞이하게 되는 것이죠.\nAI.gov의 예정된 출시일은 7월 4일입니다\n\n\n'ai.gov'의 세 가지 핵심 기능\n유출된 사이트의 내용을 종합해보면, 'ai.gov'는 크게 세 가지 핵심 요소로 구성됩니다. 정부 업무를 완전히 바꿔놓을 수도 있는 기능들이죠.\n핵심 기능\n설명\n\n\n\n\n1. 챗봇 (Chatbot)\n정확히 어떤 기능을 할지는 아직 불분명하지만, 대국민 서비스나 내부 업무 지원에 활용될 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n2. 통합 API (All-in-one API)\n정부 기관들이 자신들의 시스템을 OpenAI, 구글, 앤트로픽 같은 거대 AI 기업의 모델에 손쉽게 연결할 수 있도록 지원합니다. 아마존 베드록 같은 서비스를 통해 제공될 예정입니다.\n\n\n3. 콘솔 (CONSOLE)\n기관 내에서 직원들이 AI를 어떻게 사용하고 있는지, 어떤 도구를 선호하는지 등을 실시간으로 모니터링하는 획기적인 도구입니다.\n\n\n\n \n기대와 우려: 빛과 그림자\n정부 업무가 자동화되고 효율성이 높아진다는 점은 분명 큰 기대감을 갖게 합니다. 하지만 전문가들은 동시에 심각한 우려를 표하고 있습니다. AI 시스템이 시민들의 개인 식별 정보나 기밀 데이터를 대규모로 처리하게 될 경우, 엄청난 보안 위험을 초래할 수 있다는 것이죠.\n주의하세요!\n'ai.gov'는 정부 사용을 위해 보안 인증(FedRAMP)을 받은 AI 모델을 사용할 것이라고 밝혔습니다. 하지만 유출된 API 문서에는 아직 이 인증을 받지 않은 것으로 보이는 기업 '코히어(Cohere)'의 모델이 포함되어 있어, 보안 정책에 대한 의문을 낳고 있습니다.\n정부의 AI 도입은 대규모 해고나 중요한 의사결정을 AI에 의존하게 되는 문제로 이어질 수도 있습니다. 기술의 발전이 가져올 편리함 뒤에 가려진 그림자를 신중하게 살펴봐야 하는 이유입니다.\n \n이 기사가 시사하는 점\n이번 'ai.gov' 유출 사건은 단순한 해프닝을 넘어 몇 가지 중요한 시사점을 던져줍니다. 첫째, AI 기술이 이제 국가 경쟁력의 핵심 요소로 자리 잡았다는 점입니다. 미국 정부가 중앙에서 직접 AI 플랫폼을 구축하는 것은 AI를 국가 전략의 우선순위로 삼고 있음을 명확히 보여줍니다.\n둘째, 정부 행정에 민간 기업의 혁신 방식이 빠르게 이식되고 있습니다. 테슬라 출신 인사가 프로젝트를 이끄는 것처럼, '스타트업처럼 운영하겠다'는 생각은 공공 서비스의 효율성을 극대화할 수 있지만, 동시에 안정성보다 속도를 중시하는 문화가 가져올 부작용에 대한 고민도 필요해 보입니다.\n마지막으로, 데이터 보안과 거버넌스가 가장 중요한 화두로 떠오를 것입니다. 모든 기관의 AI 사용을 중앙에서 관리하고, 방대한 기밀 정보와 개인정보를 다루는 플랫폼은 전례 없는 수준의 보안 체계를 요구합니다. 이 프로젝트의 성공 여부는 기술력뿐만 아니라, 데이터를 얼마나 안전하고 윤리적으로 다룰 수 있느냐에 달려있다고 해도 과언이 아닙니다.\n \n\n'ai.gov' 유출 사건 한눈에 보기\n사건의 발단: 미국 정부의 AI 플랫폼 'ai.gov' 소스 코드가 GitHub에 실수로 유출되었습니다.\n핵심 인물: 전 테슬라 관리자 '토마스 셰드'가 정부의 AI 우선 전략을 주도하고 있습니다.\n주요 기능:\n챗봇 + 통합 API (OpenAI, Google 등) + 실시간 모니터링 '콘솔'\n가장 큰 우려: 시민들의 민감한 개인정보 및 기밀 데이터 처리 시 발생할 수 있는 보안 문제입니다.\n'ai.gov'는 7월 4일 공개를 목표로 하고 있었습니다.\n자주 묻는 질문\nQ: 'ai.gov'가 정확히 무엇인가요?\nA: 미국 연방정부 기관들이 AI 기술을 업무에 도입하고 활용할 수 있도록 만들어진 중앙 허브 플랫폼입니다.\nQ: 누가 이 프로젝트를 주도하고 있나요?\nA: 기술 혁신 서비스(TTS)의 책임자인 토마스 셰드가 주도하고 있습니다. 그는 과거 테슬라에서 근무한 경력이 있습니다.\nQ: 어떤 AI 모델을 사용할 수 있나요?\nA: OpenAI, 구글, 앤트로픽 등 주요 기업들의 AI 모델을 통합 API를 통해 사용할 수 있을 예정입니다.\nQ: 가장 큰 우려 사항은 무엇인가요?\nA: AI가 방대한 양의 시민 개인정보와 정부 기밀 데이터를 다루게 되면서 발생할 수 있는 보안 사고 및 데이터 유출 위험입니다.\nQ: 이 정보는 어떻게 알려지게 되었나요?\nA: 프로젝트의 소스 코드가 담긴 GitHub 저장소가 실수로 대중에게 잠시 공개되면서 알려지게 되었습니다.\n정부의 AI 활용, 여러분은 어떻게 생각하시나요? 편리한 미래를 위한 발돋움일까요, 아니면 새로운 위험의 시작일까요? 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 댓글로 자유롭게 의견을 나눠주세요.\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n    \"mainEntity\": [\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"'ai.gov'가 정확히 무엇인가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"미국 연방정부 기관들이 AI 기술을 업무에 도입하고 활용할 수 있도록 만들어진 중앙 허브 플랫폼입니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"누가 이 프로젝트를 주도하고 있나요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"기술 혁신 서비스(TTS)의 책임자인 토마스 셰드가 주도하고 있습니다. 그는 과거 테슬라에서 근무한 경력이 있습니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"어떤 AI 모델을 사용할 수 있나요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"OpenAI, 구글, 앤트로픽 등 주요 기업들의 AI 모델을 통합 API를 통해 사용할 수 있을 예정입니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"가장 큰 우려 사항은 무엇인가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"AI가 방대한 양의 시민 개인정보와 정부 기밀 데이터를 다루게 되면서 발생할 수 있는 보안 사고 및 데이터 유출 위험입니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"이 정보는 어떻게 알려지게 되었나요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"프로젝트의 소스 코드가 담긴 GitHub 저장소가 실수로 대중에게 잠시 공개되면서 알려지게 되었습니다.\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",

AI 모델들은 방대한 데이터로 학습하는데, 챗GPT나 클로드 같은 모델들은 공개된 웹을 크롤링하며 데이터를 학습하거든요. 이건 마치 수많은 웹페이지 중 하나로 유튜브를 보는 것과 같아요. 영상의 내부 데이터 구조나 스크립트의 정확한 형식, 메타데이터 체계까지 완벽하게 파악하기엔 한계가 명확할 수밖에 없죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">하지만 Gemini는 Google의 내부 AI잖아요? 말 그대로 <span style=\"background-color: #e0f2f7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">'YouTube의 설계도'를 보면서 학습</span>하는 거예요! 외부에서는 접근조차 불가능한, 완벽하게 정제된 수십억 개의 영상 데이터와 스크립트, 타임스탬프, 댓글, 심지어 추천 알고리즘 데이터 같은 초고품질의 내부 데이터셋으로 훈련받았다는 의미입니다. 그래서 Gemini는 유튜브 페이지의 HTML 구조를 봤을 때, 광고나 추천 영상 같은 불필요한 노이즈는 효과적으로 걸러내고 어디에 핵심 정보가 있는지 본질적으로 더 잘 찾아냅니다. 진짜 다르죠?

AI 도구 하나로 모든 유튜브 영상을 단 몇 초 만에 완벽하게 분석하고, 블로그 글부터 SNS 콘텐츠까지 자동으로 만들어낼 수 있는 비결을 공개합니다. 완전 무료!\n유튜브 영상 분석부터 콘텐츠 제작까지 한 번에\n\n\n \n오늘날, 세상의 모든 트렌드, 정보, 그리고 학습은 유튜브로 통하잖아요? 이제 유튜브는 단순한 영상 플랫폼을 넘어 우리 일상과 비즈니스에 엄청난 영향을 미치고 있죠. 이런 시대에 쏟아지는 유튜브 영상의 핵심을 빠르고 깊이 있게 파악하는 능력은 정말 선택이 아닌 필수 생존 기술이 되어버렸어요.  \n저도 유튜브에서 유용한 정보를 많이 얻는데, 가끔 너무 바빠서 긴 영상을 다 볼 시간이 없을 때가 많아요. 그럴 때 유튜브 요약을 할 일이 생기면 여러분은 어떤 방법을 쓰시나요? 아마 많은 분들이 'YouTube Summary' 같은 크롬 확장 프로그램을 사용하고 계실 거예요. 저도 오랫동안 유용하게 써왔는데, 솔직히 무료 버전은 아쉬운 점이 많았어요.  \n예를 들면, 가장 중요한 영상 요약 기능이 하루에 단 3개까지만 가능했어요. 중요한 영상 몇 개 보고 나면 그날은 더 이상 쓸 수 없어서 답답했죠. 그리고 더 깊이 있는 분석을 제공하는 '고급 요약' 기능은 아예 사용할 수 없었고요. 그래서 저는 이런 일일 사용량 제한이나 기능 제약 없이, 단순 요약을 넘어 분석부터 콘텐츠 재창조까지 한번에 처리하는, 진정으로 강력하고 자유로운 도구는 없을까 계속 고민했어요.\n바로 그 고민의 결과물이, 오늘 여러분께 완전 무료로 공개할 저의 최종 병기, '유튜브 분석 전문가' GEM입니다! 함께 보러 가시죠! ✨\n \n왜 하필 Gemini인가요? 기술적 팩트체크!  ️‍♀️\n아마 가장 궁금하실 질문일 거예요. \"왜 챗GPT나 클로드 같은 다른 AI는 유튜브 영상 분석에 실패하는데, 유독 Gemini만 안정적으로 분석이 가능한가?\" 저도 처음엔 같은 구글 서비스니까 그런가? 싶었는데, 단순한 이유를 넘어 여기에는 세 가지 명확한 기술적 이유가 숨어있습니다. 이 차이점을 이해하면, 왜 이 GEM이 Gemini를 기반으로 만들어졌는지 완벽하게 납득하실 거예요!\n첫째, 훈련 데이터의 '홈그라운드 어드밴티지'입니다.  \n이게 가장 결정적인 차이예요. AI 모델들은 방대한 데이터로 학습하는데, 챗GPT나 클로드 같은 모델들은 공개된 웹을 크롤링하며 데이터를 학습하거든요. 이건 마치 수많은 웹페이지 중 하나로 유튜브를 보는 것과 같아요. 영상의 내부 데이터 구조나 스크립트의 정확한 형식, 메타데이터 체계까지 완벽하게 파악하기엔 한계가 명확할 수밖에 없죠.\n하지만 Gemini는 Google의 내부 AI잖아요? 말 그대로 'YouTube의 설계도'를 보면서 학습하는 거예요! 외부에서는 접근조차 불가능한, 완벽하게 정제된 수십억 개의 영상 데이터와 스크립트, 타임스탬프, 댓글, 심지어 추천 알고리즘 데이터 같은 초고품질의 내부 데이터셋으로 훈련받았다는 의미입니다. 그래서 Gemini는 유튜브 페이지의 HTML 구조를 봤을 때, 광고나 추천 영상 같은 불필요한 노이즈는 효과적으로 걸러내고 어디에 핵심 정보가 있는지 본질적으로 더 잘 찾아냅니다. 진짜 다르죠?  \n둘째, 데이터 접근의 안정성과 정책의 차이입니다.  \n여러분께서 챗GPT에서 \"접근에 실패했습니다\"라는 오류를 자주 보셨을 텐데요, 그 주된 원인이 유튜브의 '웹 스크래핑 방지 정책' 때문이에요. 유튜브는 외부 서비스가 무분별하게 데이터를 긁어가는 것을 막기 위해 접속 빈도 제한이나 봇 차단 같은 강력한 정책을 사용하거든요.\n그런데 Gemini는 Google의 내부 서비스니까, 이런 외부용 차단 정책에서 자유롭습니다! 훨씬 더 안정적이고, 일관되게, 그리고 빠르게 필요한 데이터에 접근할 수 있는, 일종의 '내부 직원용 VIP 패스'를 가지고 있는 셈이죠. 역시 아는 길로 가는 게 최고 아니겠어요?  \n셋째, 모델 자체의 '기능 최적화'입니다. ⚙️\nGoogle은 자사의 핵심 서비스인 검색, 지도, 그리고 유튜브와의 연동을 Gemini 모델의 핵심 기능으로 설계하고 있어요. 그래서 모델 자체가 유튜브 URL을 입력받으면, '아, 이건 내가 잘 아는 유튜브 영상이구나' 하고 즉시 인지하고, 영상 콘텐츠를 분석하는 데 최적화된 내부 프로세스를 바로 가동합니다. 단순히 웹페이지 텍스트를 읽는 수준을 넘어 영상의 주제를 깊이 있게 추론하고, 핵심 메시지를 요약하며, 관련 키워드를 추출하는 능력이 다른 모델들보다 뛰어날 수밖에 없는 근본적인 이유가 바로 여기에 있습니다. 대박이죠?  \n \n \n'유튜브 분석 전문가' GEM 등록법: 단 30초면 충분! ⏱️\n자, 그럼 이 강력한 '유튜브 분석 전문가'를 어떻게 설치하는지 알아볼까요? 정말 간단해서 깜짝 놀라실 거예요!\n먼저 영상 설명란에 있는 링크를 클릭해서 지침 텍스트 전체를 복사하세요. 이 지침 파일에는 GEM이 작동하는 데 필요한 모든 코드와 규칙이 담겨 있어요.\n그다음 여러분의 Gemini 화면에서 왼쪽 메뉴의 '새 잼 만들기'를 클릭합니다.\n복사한 지침과 시각화 템플릿 파일을 그대로 붙여넣고 저장하면 끝! 잼 이름은 '유튜브 분석 전문가'로 저장하는 걸 추천해요.\n어떠세요? 이제 여러분의 Gemini는 완전히 새로운 AI로 진화했습니다! 설치는 진짜 단 30초면 충분해요. 참 쉽죠?  \n \nGEM 워크플로우 및 작동 원리: 마법의 3단계! ✨\n제가 개발한 '유튜브 분석 전문가' GEM이 어떻게 작동하는지 그 원리를 간단히 설명해 드릴게요. 이 GEM은 크게 3단계 프로세스로 똑똑하게 작동한답니다!\n데이터 수집 및 분석 단계: 사용자가 유튜브 URL을 제공하면, 영상의 스크립트와 메타데이터를 추출해요. 이때 Gemini의 유튜브 페이지 접근 기능을 활용해서 최대한 정확한 데이터를 가져옵니다. 마치 영상 내용을 스캔하듯이 말이죠!\n구조화된 분석 리포트 생성 단계: 수집된 데이터를 바탕으로 10가지 항목으로 구성된 체계적인 분석 리포트를 뚝딱 만들어냅니다. 영상 기본 정보부터 시작해서 한 줄 요약, 상세 분석, 키워드, 타임라인별 하이라이트, 분위기 분석, 타겟 오디언스, 실행 포인트, 마무리 요약, 그리고 생각해볼 질문까지! 완벽한 구조로 정리해줘서 너무 편해요.  \n8가지 후속 작업 제안 및 실행 단계: 분석 리포트 제공 직후, 8가지 추가 작업 옵션을 제시해요. 사용자가 원하는 작업의 번호를 선택하면 해당 작업을 즉시 수행해서 결과물을 제공한답니다! 여기서 핵심은 단순한 요약이 아니라, 콘텐츠의 재창조에 있어요. 원본 영상의 정보를 다양한 형태와 목적에 맞게 재구성해서 사용자에게 실질적인 가치를 제공하는 것이 이 GEM의 진짜 목표입니다!\n \n유튜브 주소 입력 후 출력되는 기본 결과: 1분 만에 영상 핵심 파악!  \nGEM을 설치한 후에는 사용법이 매우 간단해요. 그냥 유튜브 URL만 입력하면 됩니다.\n  사용 예시:\n\"분석해 주세요: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example\" 이렇게 입력하면 잠시 후 기본 분석 리포트가 자동으로 생성됩니다.\n이 리포트에는 영상 기본 정보, 한 줄 핵심 요약, 상세 분석 및 요약, 주요 키워드 및 태그, 타임라인별 하이라이트, 영상 분위기 및 스타일 분석, 타겟 오디언스, 핵심 실행 포인트, 마무리 요약, 그리고 시청 후 생각해볼 질문까지 총 10가지 섹션이 포함됩니다.\n이 기본 리포트만 있어도 10~15분짜리 영상을 1~2분 만에 완벽하게 이해할 수 있어요! 진짜 시간 절약 끝판왕이죠?  \n \n분석 리포트 후 제시되는 8가지 추가 작업: 콘텐츠 재창조의 시작!  \n이 GEM의 진짜 힘은 바로 이 부분에 있습니다! 분석 리포트를 받은 후에 제시되는 8가지 추가 작업 옵션인데요, 기본 리포트 아래에 \"분석이 완료되었습니다. 이 분석 결과를 바탕으로 아래와 같은 추가 작업을 도와드릴 수 있습니다. 원하시는 작업의 번호를 말씀해주세요.\"라는 메시지가 표시될 거예요. 이 옵션들을 활용하면 여러분의 콘텐츠 제작 효율이 엄청나게 높아질 겁니다!\n1. HTML 파일로 변환: 전문가용 보고서 생성  \n이 옵션을 선택하면 여러분은 멋진 단일 HTML 파일을 받게 돼요. 이 파일을 브라우저에서 열면, 아이콘과 색상으로 보기 좋게 디자인된 인포그래픽 스타일의 전문가용 보고서가 펼쳐진답니다. 그냥 이 파일 하나만 팀원에게 보내면 모든 설명이 끝나죠. 진짜 유용해요!\n2. 전체 스크립트 추출: 영상 대본 완벽 정리 ✍️\n영상의 전체 대본이 타임스탬프와 함께 정리된 텍스트 파일을 받을 수 있어요. 이 기능은 특히 Gemini 2.5 Pro 모델에서 더 안정적으로 작동합니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n유튜브 페이지는 단순한 텍스트 문서가 아니라 광고, 추천 영상, 댓글, 복잡한 코드 등이 얽혀있는 '복잡한 공사 현장'과 같아요. Flash 모델은 속도에 최적화되어 있어 기본적인 분석작업에서는 잘 작동하지만, 자동 생성된 자막처럼 형식이 다르거나 페이지 구조가 복잡한 경우에는 스크립트를 제대로 추출하지 못할 수 있습니다. 그래서 만약 스크립트 추출이 제대로 되지 않거나 불완전하다면, 왼쪽 상단에서 모델을 Pro로 변경한 후 다시 시도해보세요. 특히 긴 영상이나 복잡한 구조의 채널에서는 처음부터 Pro 모델을 사용하는 것이 시간을 절약하는 방법입니다!\n3. SEO 최적화 블로그 기사 생성: 발행 준비 끝!  \n이건 진짜 물건이에요! 단순 요약문이 아닌, 검색엔진 최적화(SEO)가 적용된 800자 이상의 완성형 블로그 초안을 받게 됩니다. 클릭을 유도하는 제목, 논리적인 소제목들, 본문에 자연스럽게 녹아든 핵심 키워드, 그리고 행동을 유도하는 결론까지! 거의 그대로 발행해도 될 수준의 결과물이라니, 완전 대박이죠?\n4.

ATM이나 앱에서 바로 돈을 인출할 수 있지만, 다음 결제일에 한꺼번에 갚아야 하고 이자도 바로 붙어요. 급하게 돈이 필요하다면 쓸 수 있지만, 반복해서 서비스를 이용한다면 신용점수에 좋지 않은 영향을 줄 수 있어요.\n장기카드대출(카드론): 현금서비스보다 기간이 길고, 갚는 방식도 여러 달에 걸쳐 나눠 갚는 대출 서비스예요. 카드값처럼 매달 원금과 이자를 나눠 내는 구조죠. 신청은 간편하지만 이자율은 꽤 높은 편이라 정말 필요한 상황에만 쓰는 것을 권해요.\n이월 잔액: 지난달에 다 갚지 못해 이번 달로 넘어온 카드값이에요. 명세서에서 자주 보이지만, 그냥 지나치기 쉬워요. 이자가 붙는 기준이 되기 때문에 꼼꼼히 확인해야 해요.\n선결제: 카드값을 결제일 전에 미리 갚는 기능이에요. 리볼빙이나 카드론처럼 이자가 붙는 서비스를 이용 중이라면, 선결제로 부담을 줄일 수 있어요.\n연체 이자율: 카드값을 제때 못 냈을 때 붙는 높은 이자율이에요. 일반 이자보다 더 비싸고, 연체 기간이 길어질수록 부담도 커져요. 자동이체나 결제 알림 설정으로 미리 방지하는 게 좋아요.\nCVV: 카드 뒷면에 있는 3자리 보안코드예요. 온라인 결제 시 인증용으로 쓰이는데, 이 번호만 알아도 결제가 가능하다는 점에서 유출 위험이 크기 때문에 보안에 신경 써야 해요.\n지금 알아두면\n나중에 도움 될 거예요\n지금 당장 쓸 일은 없어도, 알고 있으면 나중에 큰 도움이 될 수 있는 권리들을 알려드릴게요.\n할부 항변권: 할부로 산 물건에 문제가 있거나 가맹점에 문제가 생겼을 때, 잔여 할부금의 납입을 거부할 수 있는 소비자 권리예요. 20만 원 이상, 3개월 이상 할부일 때만 행사할 수 있으니 기억해두세요.\n할부 철회권: 상품 또는 서비스를 제공받은 날로부터 7일 이내라면, 단순 변심으로도 할부 계약을 철회할 수 있어요. 단, 상품을 이미 사용했거나 훼손시킨 경우에는 적용되지 않아요. 할부 항변권과 마찬가지로 20만 원 이상, 3개월 이상 할부 조건일 때 가능한 권리예요.\n부가서비스 해지: 카드 발급 시 나도 모르게 자동으로 가입된 유료 서비스가 있을 수 있어요. 내가 원하지 않았던 유료 서비스를 발견했다면 고객센터나 앱에서 해지할 수 있어요. 명세서를 꼼꼼하게 확인하지 않는다면 모르고 지나칠 수 있으니, 제대로 체크하는 습관이 필요해요.\n토스에서\n내게 맞는 신용카드 찾기\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n신용카드는 누구나 쉽게 만들고 쓸 수 있지만, 카드를 사용하며 만나게 되는 단어들은 결코 쉽지 않아요. 의미를 잘 모른 채 카드를 고르면, 혜택을 못 받거나 필요 없는 서비스에 가입하게 될 우려가 있어요.\n이 글을 통해 용어들을 꼼꼼하게 읽었다면, 이제 어떤 카드가 나에게 필요한지 찾고 비교하는 일만 남았을 거예요. 그런데 카드 정보를 찾아 여기저기 돌아다니는 일도 참 힘든 일입니다.\n.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스 카드라운지에서는 연회비, 실적 조건, 혜택 방식까지 내가 관심 있는 여러 카드를 비교함에 담아 한눈에 볼 수 있어요. 카드 선택부터 발급까지 한 번에 쉽게 끝낼 수 있으니, 지금 바로 토스 카드라운지에서 나에게 딱 맞는 카드를 찾아보세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✽준법감시인 심의완료(2025-361호)",

(참고로 항공기 한 대 가격이 워낙 비싸기 때문에, 항공사들은 항공기를 직접 구매하기 보다 리스를 주로 합니다)\n반면, 가변비용은 항공사가 항공편을 운영하는 데에 들어가는 비용 중 승객 수나 항공편 수에 따라 변하는 비용입니다. 연료비, 공항 이용료, 기내 서비스 비용 등이 있어요.\n고정비용 관점에서 보면, 승객이 많든 적든 항공기 리스 비용과 직원들에 대한 급여는 매달 고정적으로 나가야 하는데요. 경유 항공편은 한 항공기를 여러 구간으로 나누어 운영하기 때문에, 탑승률을 높일 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다. 한 항공기로 더 많은 승객을 태우면 원래 나가야 하는 고정비용이 여러 구간의 승객들에 의해 분산될 수 있는 것이죠.\nG: 몇 명이 탑승하든, 몇 번의 항공을 담당하든 고정비용은 어차피 나가야 하는 돈이니 항공사 입장에서 손해를 안 볼 수 있는 좋은 방법이겠네요.\nK: 맞습니다. 좀더 자세한 예시를 들어 볼게요. 서울에서 파리로 가는 직항 항공편은 한 번의 비행으로 전체 고정비용을 충당해야 합니다. 반면, 서울에서 두바이를 경유해 파리로 가는 항공편은 서울 - 두바이, 두바이 - 파리 두 구간으로 나누어 각 구간 승객들에게 고정비용을 분산하여 부담시킬 수 있는 것입니다.\n가변비용 관점에서 보면, 경유 항공편은 연료비와 공항 이용료 등이 직항편에 비해 증가할 수 있습니다. 그러나 경유편 운영을 통해 얻을 수 있는 고정비용 절감 효과에 비해 가변비용의 증가분은 크지 않을 수 있어요.\n서울에서 파리로 가는 두바이 경유 항공편의 경우, 두바이에서 추가 승객을 태워 얻을 수 있는 추가 이익이 추가로 발생하는 연료비와 공항 이용료보다 더 큰 것이죠.\nG: 결과적으로 항공사는 경유편 운영을 통해 비용을 절감할 수 있고, 이런 이유로 경유 항공편 가격이 직항 항공편보다 저렴하게 설정될 수 있는 것이군요.\nK: 그렇죠. 참고로 미국은 땅이 워낙 넓다 보니, 다른 도시로 이동할 때 (우리가 기차 타듯) 거의 모든 사람들이 비행기를 타잖아요. 비행기 사용량이 많아질 수밖에 없으니, 미국 주요 항공사들은 직항편보다 주요 허브 공항을 중심으로 여러 목적지를 연결하는 방식인 허브 앤 스포크(Hub-and-Spoke) 시스템을 운영합니다.\n델타 항공은 애틀랜타(Atlanta) 공항, 아메리칸 항공은 댈러스-포트워스(Dallas/Fort Worth) 공항, 유나이티드 항공은 시카고 오헤어(Chicago O’Hare) 공항을 허브 공항으로 사용하는데요. 경유 항공편을 통해 여러 승객을 허브 공항으로 모으고, 거기서 다시 다양한 목적지로 연결시킴으로써 비용을 절감할 수 있는 것이죠.\nG: 같은 이유로 미국 내 이동을 담당하는 항공편 역시 직항보다 경유가 저렴하군요. 직항 항공편은 허브 공항을 거치지 않고 바로 목적지로 가는 편리함을 제공하니, 더 높은 요금이 부과되는 경향이 있는 것이고요.\n3) 가격 차별 (price discrimination)\nK: 맞습니다. 한편, 경유 항공편이 직항 항공편보다 저렴한 이유를 ‘가격 차별’ 관점에서도 설명할 수 있는데요. 보통 기업은 수익을 극대화하기 위해 동일 제품이나 서비스에 가격을 다르게 설정하곤 합니다. 얼마나 비용을 지불할 능력과 의지가 있는지에 따라 고객군을 구분하죠.\n항공편을 예로 들어보겠습니다. 출장 목적으로 항공기를 이용하는 고객들은 시간에 민감해요. 출장 비용은 보통 회사에서 지원을 받기 때문에 시간을 아끼기 위해 더 비싼 직항 항공편을 선택할 가능성이 높고요.\n반면 상대적으로 시간에 여유가 있거나 비용을 중요하게 여기는 고객들은 시간이 더 걸리고 불편하더라도 비용을 아끼기 위해 경유 항공편을 선택할 가능성이 높습니다.\n항공사 입장에서는 이렇게 서로 다른 성격을 갖는 고객들에게 다른 가격을 책정한 항공편을 판매하고자 합니다. 직항 항공편과 경유 항공편에 서로 다른 가격을 책정하고, 더 많은 고객을 유치하고 수익을 늘리려 하는 것이죠.\n그래서 저가 항공사들은 더 싼 비용을 선호하는 고객들에게 다양한 경유 항공편을 낮은 가격에 제공합니다. 학생이나 예산이 한정되어 있는 여행객들을 주된 타겟으로 삼는 것이죠. 저가 항공사 입장에서는 고가의 직항 항공권 대비 저렴한 경유 항공권을 다양한 조건으로 판매하는 전략이 항공 시장 내 점유율을 높이는 것이라 판단한 것이죠.\nG: 그렇겠네요. 비용에 민감한 고객들을 데려올 수 있는 확실한 방법이니까요.\nK: 이러한 가격 차별 원리를 항공편이 아닌 다른 분야에서도 찾아볼 수 있는데요. 예전에 살펴본 학생 할인이 대표적인 예시입니다. 학생들은 직장인 대비 구매력이 떨어지는 고객이기에, 기업 입장에서는 아예 학생과 직장인 두 그룹으로 소비자를 구분해 서로 다른 가격을 매기는 것이죠.\n우리가 많이 이용하는 유튜브도 가격 차별 원리를 잘 이용하고 있습니다. 유튜브는 광고가 없는 유료 서비스와 중간에 광고가 포함되는 무료 서비스를 나누어 제공하고 있는데요. 비용을 내더라도 끊김 없이 시청하고자 하는 고객과 중간 광고가 좀 불편하더라도 비용을 아끼는 것이 더 중요한 고객을 아예 구분하고, 각각의 고객에 맞는 맞춤형 서비스를 제공하는 것입니다.\n넷플릭스도 마찬가지죠. 광고 없이 시청할 수 있는 상품에 비해, 중간 광고가 나오는 상품 가격이 더 저렴합니다. 시간이나 편의성을 중요시하는 고객에게는 프리미엄 버전을, 비용을 중시하는 고객에게는 보다 경제적인 버전을 제공하는 가격 차별 전략을 사용하는 것이죠.\n\n오늘은 경유 항공편이 직항 항공편을 비교해 보면서 항공사들이 어떻게 가격을 책정하고, 왜 일부 노선이 상대적으로 저렴한지에 대해 1) 수요와 공급의 원리, 2) 고정비용과 가변비용, 3) 가격 차별 - 세 가지 경제 이론으로 살펴보았는데요. 앞으로 여행 계획을 세울 때 이 개념을 떠올리면서 항공권의 가격을 비교해보면 좋을 것 같습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이제현\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}– 해당 콘텐츠는 2024. 07. 31. 기준으로 작성되고, 2025년 6월 30일 기준으로 업데이트됐습니다.",
