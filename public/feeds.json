        "content:encodedSnippet": "With the launch of Visual Studio 2026, we announced a Private Preview of GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++, which reduces the cost of adopting the latest version of the MSVC Build Tools. We used the feedback we received from our many Private Preview participants to make improvements that benefit all our users. After receiving feedback, we added support for CMake projects, reduced hallucinations, removed several critical failures, improved Copilot’s behavior when encountering an internal compiler error, and reinforced Copilot’s understanding of when project files need to be modified to do the upgrade.\nHere’s what one of our Private Preview participants said about their experience:\n“Having Copilot guide the upgrade flow and surface suggested changes in context has made that process smoother than doing it entirely by hand or by another agent.” – Private Preview participant\n\nWe are happy to announce that this feature is now available to all C++ users as a Public Preview in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nTo get started, check out the documentation on Microsoft Learn.\nWhat to expect\nAfter launching GitHub Copilot app modernization, Copilot will examine your project to see if there are any steps to take to update your project settings to move to the newer MSVC version. If so, it’ll assist you in making those changes.\nAssessment\nAfter the settings have been updated, Copilot will do an initial build to assess if there are any issues blocking your upgrade, such as stricter conformance, warnings whose warning level has changed, or non-standard extensions that have been deprecated or removed. After the assessment is complete, Copilot checks with you to confirm accuracy, and gives you a chance to give it further instructions like ignoring specific or entire categories of issues.\n\nPlanning\nAfter you and Copilot agree on the assessment, it will move into the planning stage, where Copilot will propose solutions to all the issues that need to be addressed. Again, it will produce a detailed description of these solutions and its reasoning for applying them, and it will check with you for any additional information. If you don’t like the proposed solution, you can direct it down another path.\n\nExecution\nOnce the plan is set, Copilot will break the plan down into concrete tasks for execution. You can direct it to approach the implementation in ways that fit your organization’s processes, such as by keeping similar changes in the same commit or using a particular style guideline when editing the code. Copilot will execute the tasks and initiate another build to check that all issues are resolved. If they aren’t, it will iterate until it has resolved the issues for you.\n\nYou are in control\nAt every step of the way, you can shape Copilot’s behavior, guiding it towards solutions that fit your own expectations, saving you time researching, diagnosing issues, designing solutions, and implementing those solutions. It can take a multi-person, multi-week task of upgrading your build tools and turn it into something you do on the same day as the release of the new tools.\nTalk to us!\nWe are excited for you to try out this feature. Get started by installing the latest build of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Let us know how well this feature is working for you and how we can make it even better. If you have any questions or general comments about the feature, feel free to leave a comment on this blog post. If you want to suggest an improvement, you can use the Help > Send Feedback menu directly in Visual Studio to post on Developer Community.\nThe post GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is now in Public Preview appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

This update brings a host of new additions, including project outline updates for filtering and bookmarking CMake targets in large CMake projects and expanded CTest support to customize this output. To view the full list of updates with this release, please look at our CHANGELOG.\nThis release features the following contributions from our open-source community. Thank you for your continued support!\nAdd bookmarks and filtering of outline view by @bradphelan\nAdd pre-fill project name using current folder name by @ho-cooh\nAdd API v5 which adds presets api by @OrkunTokdemir\nAdd output parser for include-what-you-use by @malsyned\nIn test explorer, associated CTest tests with outermost function or macro invocation that calls add_test() instead of with the add_test() call itself by @malsyned\nBetter support of cmake v4.1 and its error index files in cmake-file-api replies by @STMicroelectronics\nFix bug in which clicking “Run Test” for filtered tests executed all tests instead by @hippo91\nFix auto-focusing the “Search” input field in the CMake cache view by @simhof-basyskom\nProject Outline view updates: Filter and bookmark your CMake Targets\nNavigating through large CMake projects with many nested targets can sometimes be difficult. The Project Outline view has been updated to have filtering and bookmarking support, making it easier to manage your CMake targets.\nFilter through complex target outlines\nYou can now filter the Project Outline view to quickly locate specific targets in large projects. This is especially useful when working with projects that generate dozens of targets across multiple subdirectories.\n\nFor example, you might filter targets by a feature area or naming convention.\n\nBookmark commonly used CMake targets\nCMake Tools now supports bookmarking commonly used targets so they appear in a dedicated Bookmarks section in the CMake sidebar. This provides quick access to targets you build, debug, or run most often, without having to repeatedly search through the full project hierarchy.\nTo bookmark a target, navigate to the desired target in the Project Outline view and select Toggle Bookmark.\n\nThis will add the selected target to the separate Bookmarks section in the CMake sidebar. From here, commonly used targets can be built, debugged, or ran in the terminal.\nImproved CTest failure output.\nThis release also improves the CTest experience by adding support for configurable failure patterns. With the new Failure Patterns setting, you can tell CMake Tools how to interpret test output so failures surface more useful and structured information.\n\nThis is particularly helpful for test frameworks where important failure details, such as diffs or assertion outputs, are embedded in test logs. Instead of manually digging through raw output, you can define patterns that extract and highlight the relevant information directly after a test fails.\nFor example, you can define how CHECK_EQUAL shows diffing straight to the user.\nThis allows the user to have a transparent view of their test failures and quickly debug any test output.\n\nWhat do you think?\nDownload Visual Studio Code and our C++ extensions (CMake Tools and C/C++) and let us know what you think. We would love to see what you contribute to our repo.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats.\nWhatsApp’s experience creating and distributing our media consistency library in Rust to billions of devices and browsers proves Rust is production ready at a global scale.\nOur Media Handling Strategy\nWhatsApp provides default end-to-end encryption for over 3 billion people to message securely each and every day. Online security is an adversarial space, and to continue ensuring users can keep messaging securely, we’re constantly adapting and evolving our strategy against cyber-security threats – all while supporting the WhatsApp infrastructure to help people connect. \nFor example, WhatsApp, like many other applications, allows users to share media and other types of documents. WhatsApp helps protect users by warning about dangerous attachments like APKs, yet rare and sophisticated malware could be hidden within a seemingly benign file like an image or video. These maliciously crafted files might target unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries distributed by the operating system, or the application itself.\nTo help protect against such potential threads, WhatsApp is increasingly using the Rust programming language, including in our media sharing functionality. Rust is a memory safe language offering numerous security benefits. We believe that this is the largest rollout globally of any library written in Rust.\nTo help explain why and how we rolled this out, we should first look back at a key OS-level vulnerability that sent an important signal to WhatsApp around hardening media-sharing defenses.\n2015 Android Vulnerability: A Wake-up Call for Media File Protections\nIn 2015, Android devices, and the applications that ran on them, became vulnerable to the “Stagefright” vulnerability. The bug lay in the processing of media files by operating system-provided libraries, so WhatsApp and other applications could not patch the underlying vulnerability. Because it could often take months for people to update to the latest version of their software, we set out to find solutions that would keep WhatsApp users safe, even in the event of an operating system vulnerability. \nAt that time, we realized that a cross-platform C++ library already developed by WhatsApp to send and consistently format MP4 files (called “wamedia”) could be modified to detect files which do not adhere to the MP4 standard and might trigger bugs in a vulnerable OS library on the receiver side – hence putting a target’s security at risk. We rolled out this check and were able to protect WhatsApp users from the Stagefright vulnerability much more rapidly than by depending on users to update the OS itself.\nBut because media checks run automatically on download and process untrusted inputs, we identified early on that wamedia was a prime candidate for using a memory safe language. \n\nOur Solution: Rust at Scale\nRather than an incremental rewrite, we developed the Rust version of wamedia in parallel with the original C++ version. We used differential fuzzing and extensive integration and unit tests to ensure compatibility between the two implementations.\nTwo major hurdles were the initial binary size increase due to bringing in the Rust standard library and the build system support required for the diverse platforms supported by WhatsApp. WhatsApp made a long-term bet to build that support. In the end, we replaced 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) with 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests). The Rust version showed performance and runtime memory usage advantages over the C++. Given this success, Rust was fully rolled out to all WhatsApp users and many platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Web, Wearables, and more. With this positive evidence in hand, memory safe languages will play an ever increasing part in WhatsApp’s overall approach to application and user security.\nOver time, we’ve added more checks for non-conformant structures within certain file types to help protect downstream libraries from parser differential exploit attempts. Additionally, we check higher risk file types, even if structurally conformant, for risk indicators. For instance, PDFs are often a vehicle for malware, and more specifically, the presence of embedded files and scripting elements within a PDF further raise risks. We also detect when one file type masquerades as another, through a spoofed extension or MIME type. Finally, we uniformly flag known dangerous file types, such as executables or applications, for special handling in the application UX. Altogether, we call this ensemble of checks “Kaleidoscope.” This system protects people on WhatsApp from potentially malicious unofficial clients and attachments. Although format checks will not stop every attack, this layer of defense helps mitigate many of them.\nEach month, these libraries are distributed to billions of phones, laptops, desktops, watches, and browsers running on multiple operating systems for people on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This is the largest ever deployment of Rust code to a diverse set of end-user platforms and products that we are aware of. Our experience speaks to the production-readiness and unique value proposition of Rust on the client-side.\nHow Rust Fits In To WhatsApp’s Approach to App Security\nThis is just one example of WhatsApp’s many investments in security. It’s why we built default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls, offer end-to-end encrypted backups, and use key transparency technology to verify a secure connection, provide additional calling protections, and more.\nWhatsApp has a strong track record of being loud when we find issues and working to hold bad actors accountable. For example, WhatsApp reports CVEs for important issues we find in our applications, even if we do not find evidence of exploitation. We do this to give people on WhatsApp the best chance of protecting themselves by seeing a security advisory and updating quickly.\nTo ensure application security, we first must identify and quantify the sources of risk. We do this through internal and external audits like NCC Group’s public assessment of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted backups, fuzzing, static analysis, supply chain management, and automated attack surface analysis. We also recently expanded our Bug Bounty program to introduce the WhatsApp Research Proxy – a tool that makes research into WhatsApp’s network protocol more effective.\nNext, we reduce the identified risk. Like many others in the industry, we found that the majority of the high severity vulnerabilities we published were due to memory safety issues in code written in the C and C++ programming languages. To combat this we invest in three parallel strategies:\nDesign the product to minimize unnecessary attack surface exposure.\nInvest in security assurance for the remaining C and C++ code.\nDefault the choice of memory safe languages, and not C and C++, for new code.\nWhatsApp has added protections like CFI, hardened memory allocators, safer buffer handling APIs, and more. C and C++ developers have specialized security training, development guidelines, and automated security analysis on their changes. We also have strict SLAs for fixing issues uncovered by the risk identification process.\nAccelerating Rust Adoption to Enhance Security\nRust enabled WhatsApp’s security team to develop a secure, high performance, cross-platform library to ensure media shared on the platform is consistent and safe across devices. This is an important step forward in adding additional security behind the scenes for users and part of our ongoing defense-in-depth approach. Security teams at WhatsApp and Meta are highlighting opportunities for high impact adoption of Rust to interested teams, and we anticipate accelerating adoption of Rust over the coming years. \nThe post Rust at Scale: An Added Layer of Security for WhatsApp appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The AI Evolution of Graph Search at Netflix: From Structured Queries to Natural Language\nBy Alex Hutter and Bartosz Balukiewicz\nOur previous blog posts (part 1, part 2, part 3) detailed how Netflix’s Graph Search platform addresses the challenges of searching across federated data sets within Netflix’s enterprise ecosystem. Although highly scalable and easy to configure, it still relies on a structured query language for input. Natural language based search has been possible for some time, but the level of effort required was high. The emergence of readily-available AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), has created new opportunities to integrate AI search features, with a smaller investment and improved accuracy.\nWhile Text-to-Query and Text-to-SQL are established problems, the complexity of distributed Graph Search data in the GraphQL ecosystem necessitates innovative solutions. This is the first in a three-part series where we will detail our journey: how we implemented these solutions, evaluated their performance, and ultimately evolved them into a self-managed platform.\nThe Need for Intuitive Search: Addressing Business and Product Demands\nNatural language search is the ability to use everyday language to retrieve information as opposed to complex, structured query languages like the Graph Search Filter Domain Specific Language (DSL). When users interact with 100’s of various UIs within the suite of Content and Business Products applications, a frequent task is filtering a data table like the one below:\nExample Content and Business Products application view\nIdeally, a user simply wants to satisfy a query like “I want to see all movies from the 90s about robots from the US.” Because the underlying platform operates on the Graph Search Filter DSL, the application acts as an intermediary. Users input their requirements through UI elements — toggling facets or using query builders — and the system programmatically converts these interactions into a valid DSL query to filter the data.\nThe Complexity of filtering and DSL generation\nThis process presents a few issues.\nToday, many applications have bespoke components for collecting user input — the experience varies across them and they have inconsistent support for the DSL. Users need to “learn” how to use each application to achieve their goals.\nAdditionally, some domains have hundreds of fields in an index that could be faceted or filtered by. A subject matter expert (SME) may know exactly what they want to accomplish, but be bottlenecked by the inefficient pace of filling out a large scale UI form and translating their questions in order to encode it in a representation Graph Search needs.\nMost importantly, users think and operate using natural language, not technical constructs like query builders, components, or DSLs. By requiring them to switch contexts, we introduce friction that slows them down or even prevents their progress.\nWith readily-available AI components, our users can now interact with our systems through natural language. The challenge now is to make sure our offering, searching Netflix’s complex enterprise state with natural language, is an intuitive and trustworthy experience.\nNatural language queries translated into Graph Search Filter DSL\nWe’ve made a decision to pursue generating Graph Search Filter statements from natural language to meet this need. Our intention is to augment and not replace existing applications with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), providing tooling and capabilities so that applications in our ecosystem have newly accessible means of processing and presenting their data in their distinct domain flavours. It should be noted that all the work here has direct application to building a RAG system on top of Graph Search in the future.\nUnder the Hood: Our Approach to Text-to-Query\nThe core function of the text-to-query process is converting a user’s (often ambiguous) natural language question into a structured query. We primarily achieve this through the use of an LLM.\nBefore we dive deeper, let’s quickly revisit the structure of Graph Search Filter DSL. Each Graph Search index is defined by a GraphQL query, made up of a collection of fields. Each field has a type e.g. boolean, string, and some have their permitted values governed by controlled vocabularies — a standardized and governed list of values (like an enumeration, or a foreign key). The names of those fields can be used to construct expressions using comparison (e.g. > or ==) or inclusion/exclusion operators (e.g. IN). In turn those expressions can be combined using logical operators (e.g. AND) to construct complex statements.\nGraph Search Filter DSL\nWith that understanding, we can now more rigorously define the conversion process. We need the LLM to generate a Graph Search Filter DSL statement that is syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct.\nSyntactic correctness is easy — does it parse? To be syntactically correct, the generated statement must be well formed i.e. follow the grammar of the Graph Search Filter DSL.\nSemantic correctness adds some additional complexity as it requires more knowledge of the index itself. To be semantically correct:\n\nit must respect the field types i.e. only use comparisons that make sense given the underlying type;\nit must only use fields that are actually present in the index, i.e. does not hallucinate;\nwhen the values of a field are constrained to a controlled vocabulary, any comparison must only use values from that controlled vocabulary.\n\nPragmatic correctness is much more difficult. It asks the question: does the generated filter actually capture the intent of the user’s query?\nThe following sections will detail how we pre-process the user’s question to create appropriate context for the instructions that we will provide to the LLM — both of which are fundamental to LLM interaction — as well as post-processing we perform on the generated statement to validate it, and help users understand and trust the results they receive.\nAt a high level that process looks like this:\nGraph Search FIlter DSL generation process\nContext Engineering\nPreparation for the filter generation task is predominantly engineering the appropriate context. The LLM will need access to the fields of an index and their metadata in order to construct semantically correct filters. As the indices are defined by GraphQL queries, we can use the type information from the GraphQL schema to derive much of the required information. For some fields, there is additional information we can provide beyond what’s available in the schema as well, in particular permissible values that pull from controlled vocabularies.\nEach field in the index is associated with metadata as seen below, and that metadata is provided as part of the context.\nGraph Search index representation\nThe field is derived from the document path as characterized by the GraphQL query.\nThe description is the comment from the GraphQL schema for the field.\nThe type is derived from the GraphQL schema for the field e.g. Boolean, String, enum. We also support an additional controlled vocabulary type we will discuss more of shortly.\nThe valid values are derived from enum values for the enum type or from a controlled vocabulary as we will now discuss.\n\nA controlled vocabulary is a specific field type that consists of a finite set of allowed values, which are defined by a SMEs or domain owners. Index fields can be associated with a particular controlled vocabulary, e.g. countries with members such as Spain and Thailand, and any usage of that field within a generated statement must refer to values from that vocabulary.\nNaively providing all the metadata as context to the LLM worked for simple cases but did not scale. Some indices have hundreds of fields and some controlled vocabularies have thousands of valid values. Providing all of those, especially the controlled vocabulary values and their accompanying metadata, expands the context; this proportionally increases latency and decreases the correctness of generated filter statements. Not providing the values wasn’t an option as we needed to ground the LLMs generated statements- without them, the LLM would frequently hallucinate values that did not exist.\nCurating the context to an appropriate subset was a problem we addressed using the well known RAG pattern.\nField RAG\nAs mentioned previously, some indices have hundreds of fields, however, most user’s questions typically refer only to a handful of them. If there was no cost in including them all, we would, but as mentioned prior, there is a cost in terms of the latency of query generation as well as the correctness of the generated query (e.g. needle-in-the-hackstack problem) and non-deterministic results.\nTo determine which subset of fields to include in the context, we “match” them against the intent of the user’s question.\n\nEmbeddings are created for index fields and their metadata (name, description, type) and are indexed in a vector store\nAt filter generation time, the user’s question is chunked with an overlapping strategy. For each chunk, we perform a vector search to identify the top K most relevant values and the fields to which they belong.\nDeduplication: The top K fields from each chunk are both consolidated and deduplicated before being provided as context to the system instructions.\nField RAG process (chunking, merge, deduplicate)\nControlled Vocabularies RAG\nIndex fields of the controlled vocabulary type are associated with a particular controlled vocabulary, again, countries are one example. Given a user’s question, we can infer whether or not it refers to values of a particular controlled vocabulary. In turn, by knowing which controlled vocabulary values are present, we can identify additional, related index fields that should be included in the context that may not have been identified by the field RAG step.\nEach controlled vocabulary value has:\n\na unique identifier within its type;\na human readable display name;\na description of the value;\nalso-known-as values or AKA display names, e.g. “romcom” for “Romantic Comedy”.\n\nTo determine which subset of values to include in the context for controlled vocabulary fields (and also possibly infer additional fields), we “match” them against the user’s question.\n\nEmbeddings are created for controlled vocabulary values and their metadata, and these are indexed in a vector store. The controlled vocabularies are available via GraphQL and are regularly fetched and reindexed so this system stays up to date with any changes in the domain.\nAt filter generation time, the user’s question is chunked. For each chunk, we perform a vector search to identify the top K most relevant values (but only for the controlled vocabularies that are associated with fields in the index)\nThe top K values from each chunk are deduplicated by their controlled vocabulary type. The associated field definition is then injected into the context along with the matched values.\nControlled Vocabularies RAG\nCombining both approaches, the RAG of fields and controlled vocabularies, we end up with the solution that each input question resolves in available and matched fields and values:\nField and CV RAG\nThe quality of results generated by the RAG tool can be significantly enhanced by tuning its various parameters, or “levers.” These include strategies for reranking, chunking, and the selection of different embedding generation models. The careful and systematic evaluation of these factors will be the focus of the subsequent parts of this series.\nThe Instructions\nOnce the context is constructed, it is provided to the LLM with a set of instructions and the user’s question. The instructions can be summarised as follows: “Given a natural language question, generate a syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct filter statement given the availability of the following index fields and their metadata.”\n\nIn order to generate a syntactically correct filter statement, the instructions include the syntax rules of the DSL.\nIn order to generate a semantically correct filter statement, the instructions tell the LLM to ground the generated statement in the provided context.\nIn order to generate a pragmatically correct filter statement, so far we focus on better context engineering to ensure that only the most relevant fields and values are provided. We haven’t identified any instructions that make the LLM just “do better” at this aspect of the task.\nGraph Search Filter DSL generation\nAfter the filter statement is generated by the LLM, we deterministically validate it prior to returning the values to the user.\nValidation\nSyntactic Correctness\nSyntactic correctness ensures the LLM output is a parsable filter statement. We utilize an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser built for our custom DSL. If the generated string fails to parse into a valid AST, we know immediately that the query is malformed and there is a fundamental issue with the generation.\nThe other approach to solve this problem could be using the structured outputs modes provided by some LLMs. However, our initial evaluation yielded mixed results, as the custom DSL is not natively supported and requires further work.\nSemantic Correctness\nDespite careful context engineering using the RAG pattern, the LLM sometimes hallucinates both fields and available values in the generated filter statement. The most straightforward way of preventing this phenomenon is validating the generated filters against available index metadata. This approach does not impact the overall latency of the system, as we are already working with an AST of the filter statement, and the metadata is freely available from the context engineering stage.\nDSL verification & hallucinations\nIf a hallucination is detected it can be returned as an error to a user, indicating the need to refine the query, or can be provided back to the LLM in the form of a feedback loop for self correction.\nThis increases the filter generation time, so should be used cautiously with a limited number of retries.\nBuilding Confidence\nYou probably noticed we are not validating the generated filter for pragmatic correctness. That task is the hardest challenge: The filter parses (syntactic) and uses real fields (semantic), but is it what the user meant? When a user searches for “Dark”, do they mean the specific German sci-fi series Dark, or are they browsing for the mood category “dark TV shows”?\nThe gap between what a user intended and the generated filter statement is often caused by ambiguity. Ambiguity stems from the compression of natural language. A user says “German time-travel mystery with the missing boy and the cave” but the index contains discrete metadata fields like releaseYear, genreTags, and synopsisKeywords.\nHow do we ensure users aren’t inadvertently led to wrong answers or to answers for questions they didn’t ask?\nShowing Our Work\nOne way we are handling ambiguity is by showing our work. We visualise the generated filters in the UI in a user-friendly way allowing them to very clearly see if the answer we’re returning is what they were looking for so they can trust the results..\nWe cannot show a raw DSL string (e.g., origin.country == ‘Germany’ AND genre.tags CONTAINS ‘Time Travel’ AND synopsisKeywords LIKE ‘*cave*’) to a non-technical user. Instead, we reflect its underlying AST into UI components.\nAfter the LLM generates a filter statement, we parse it into an AST, and then map that AST to the existing “Chips” and “Facets” in our UI (see below). If the LLM generates a filter for origin.country == ‘Germany’, the user sees the “Country” dropdown pre-selected to “Germany.” This gives users immediate visual feedback and the ability to easily fine-tune the query using standard UI controls when the results need improvement or further experimentation.\nGenerated filters visualisation\nExplicit Entity Selection\nAnother strategy we’ve developed to remove ambiguity happens at query time. We give users the ability to constrain their input to refer to known entities using “@mentions”. Similar to Slack, typing @ lets them search for entities directly from our specialized UI Graph Search component, giving them easy access to multiple controlled vocabularies (plus other identifying metadata like launch year) to feel confident they’re choosing the entity they intend.\nIf a user types, “When was @dark produced”, we explicitly know they are referring to the Series controlled vocabulary, allowing us to bypass the RAG inference step and hard-code that context, significantly increasing pragmatic correctness (and building user trust in the process).\nExample @mentions usage in the UI\nEnd-to-end architecture\nAs mentioned previously, the solution architecture is divided into pre-processing, filter statement generation, and then post-processing stages. The pre-processing handles context building and involves a RAG pattern for similarity search, while the post-processing validation stage checks the correctness of the LLM-generated filter statements and provides visibility into the results for end users. This design strategically balances LLM involvement with more deterministic strategies.\nEnd-to-end architecture\nThe end-to-end process is as follows:\n\nA user’s natural language question (with optional `@mentions` statements) are provided as input, along with the Graph Search index context\nThe context is scoped by using the RAG pattern on both fields and possible values\nThe pre-processed context and the question are fed into the LLM with an instruction asking for a syntactically and semantically correct filter statement\nThe generated filer statement DSL is verified and checked for hallucinations\nThe final response contains the related AST in order to build “Chips” and “Facets”\n\nSummary\nBy combining our existing Graph Search infrastructure with the power and flexibility of LLMs, we’ve bridged the gap between complex filter statements and user intent. We moved from requiring users to speak our language (DSL) to our systems understanding theirs.\nThe initial challenge for our users was successfully addressed. However, our next steps involve transforming this system into a comprehensive and expandable platform, rigorously evaluating its performance in a live production environment, and expanding its capabilities to support GraphQL-first user interfaces. These topics, and others, will be the focus of the subsequent installments in this series. Be sure to follow along!\nYou may have noticed that we have a lot more to do on this project, including named entity recognition and extraction, intent detection so we can route questions to the appropriate indices, and query rewriting among others.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In December 2024, we published a year-in-review summary of our work on the Scala Plugin. By that time the following year, we were busy releasing IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala Plugin 2025.3, as well as preparing for the upcoming Scala 3.8 release. This was followed by a long holiday break.\nBut as they say, not all who wander are lost. Now, without further ado, let’s take a look back at the main Scala Plugin highlights of 2025.\n\n\n\n\nMain changes to the Scala Plugin\nScala 3 support\nSupporting Scala 3 sometimes feels like chasing a rabbit: While we’re working on delivering support for existing features, the compiler team is building new ones. But we’re closing the gap. Here are some of the features we added support for in 2025:\nNamed tuples\n“Better fors” and refutable patterns in for-comprehensions\nOpaque types\nContext bounds and givens\nThe new into modifier\n\n\n\n\nThe last point (support for into) is part of a larger project to ensure support for Scala 3.8 by the time it is released. Additionally, we introduced several improvements to code resolution and type inference, and addressed some “good code is red” issues in Compiler-based highlighting, making both Built-in and Compiler-based highlighting modes more reliable.\nNamed tuples and their support in Scala Plugin\n\n\n\nsbt\nThe new sbt modules layout is now enabled by default. We made several improvements to the new separate production/test modules and resolved many edge cases discovered since the feature was first released in 2024.3. We also directed a portion of our efforts toward supporting sbt 2.0, as its release is right around the corner.\n\n\n\n\nX-Ray mode\nX-Ray mode enhancements include displaying apply calls, name hints (including for all parameters, not just literals), and clearer indicators of when the apply method is being used instead of a regular constructor. We’ve also improved type hints and info for variable patterns, generators, literal parameters, underscore parameters, and kind projector syntax.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance improvements\nPerformance improvements include faster editor actions and fixes for occasional UI freezes during actions like Show Type Info and Show Implicit Argument. You can disable built-in inspections in Settings for better performance in cases where compiler highlighting will suffice. Tips and contact instructions are also available under Settings. But we’ve got plenty more where that came from and will be announcing further improvements in 2026 – stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\nYou can read about all these changes and many more in detail in our release notes:\nRelease Notes 2025.1\nRelease Notes 2025.2\nRelease Notes 2025.3\n\n\n\n\nAnd in a blog post about our support for Scala 3.8.\n\n\n\n\nState of Developer Ecosystem Survey 2025\nIn what has now become an annual tradition, JetBrains conducted a survey of users of our products. Here are a few key Scala-related insights:\n\n\n\n\nScala 3 popularity\nAmong the 446 people who answered this question, 274 (59%) answered that they use Scala 3 regularly. “Regularly” is a keyword here. We also asked about your usage of different Scala versions at home and at work. Although versions 2.13 and 2.12 are still in use, the percentage of developers who have already switched to Scala 3 but still use Scala 2 at work adds another 15% to the result.\n\n\n\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nScalaTest maintains its top position at 70% (down from 71% last year), but MUnit and ZIOTest are on the rise, coming in at 22% and 17%, respectively (as opposed to 19% and 8% last year).\n\n\n\n\nFrameworks and libraries\nCats, ZIO, and FS2 remain popular, with ZIO having the biggest increase in popularity among them, jumping from 27% in 2024 to 32% in 2025. Akka usage, on the other hand, is trending downward – it was at 35% two years ago, then fell to 30% last year, and is now at 28%. It’s clearly losing users to Pekko, which has risen from 15% to 22%.\n\n\n\n\nHead over to this page to compare this year’s numbers with those of last year. And feel free to check out The State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYouTube videos about the Scala Plugin\nIn December 2024, we released the first video in a new YouTube series about how IntelliJ IDEA supports Scala. Each video is approximately 10 minutes long and discusses one main feature, along with a few smaller, closely related ones. In 2025, we released seven more of these videos, covering various topics from enum support to the debugger. For our mobile users, we also whipped up a few YouTube Shorts addressing the same topics. You can watch them all here.\n\n\n\n\nConferences\nLast but not least, in 2025, we were Gold sponsors at two major Scala conferences: Scalar in March (Warsaw, Poland) and Scala Days in August (Lausanne, Switzerland). At Scalar, we gave a lightning talk on two closely connected Scala Plugin features: inlay hints and X-Ray mode. At Scala Days, we delivered two 40-minute talks. The first was a sort of two-for-one: It addressed how to stay productive with the Scala Plugin and gave a quick status update on Scala 3 and the contributions made to it thus far. The other talk was a walkthrough of AI tooling in IntelliJ IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for now! We hope your 2026 is off to a productive start.\n\n\n\n\nThe Scala team at JetBrains",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Rust vs JavaScript & TypeScript: performance, WebAssembly, and developer experience\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nRust and JavaScript/TypeScript aren’t competitors – they excel in different domains and are increasingly used together.\nJS/TS offers an unmatched ecosystem depth and rapid iteration, while Rust delivers performance, memory safety, and reliability.\nWebAssembly bridges the two, letting Rust power performance-critical logic inside JS/TS apps.\nHybrid Rust + JS/TS architectures are now common across major companies and open-source projects.\nRust adoption is accelerating, especially in backend, infrastructure, and Wasm-heavy workloads; JS/TS remains dominant for UI and full-stack flexibility.\nModern teams often use JS/TS for the product layer and Rust for the engine beneath it, combining speed with flexibility.\n\n\n\n\nRust and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS/TS) are often perceived as rivals, but in reality, they’re complementary languages that serve different purposes and excel across different domains. They were designed with different goals in mind, which dictate the best use cases for each.\nJavaScript/TypeScript offers benefits such as unmatched flexibility, a massive ecosystem, and rapid iteration. Meanwhile, Rust shines in projects that demand top-tier performance, memory safety, and system-level reliability. \nAnd thanks to technologies like WebAssembly, Rust code can now integrate seamlessly with JS/TS environments, effectively serving as a high-performance engine under a flexible frontend. Such hybrid projects combining Rust with JavaScript/TypeScript are on the rise, reflecting a broader trend of language collaboration. A good example of that is a Rust and TypeScript project using WebAssembly, where Rust handles performance-critical logic, and TS manages the web-facing side.\nThis article dives into the current adoption and use cases of Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript to help you explore how these two languages can work together, including real-world commercial applications.\nRust and JavaScript: Where they stand in 2025\n\n\n\n\nToday, Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript stand out as two languages shaping very different yet complementary domains. According to the 2025 Developer Ecosystem Survey, 10% of developers plan to adopt Rust next year, while TypeScript’s real-world adoption has been higher than any other language over the past five years. The survey’s Language Promise Index indicates that TypeScript, Rust, and Go have the highest perceived growth potential, while JavaScript, PHP, and SQL appear to have reached a plateau. \nLet’s take a closer look at Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript to understand their place in the current software development landscape. \n\nCategoryRustJavaScript / TypeScript\nPrimary strengthPerformance and memory safetyFlexibility and massive ecosystem\nTypical use casesSystems programming, backends, WebAssembly modules, tooling enginesFrontend apps, full stack via Node, prototyping, product layer logic\nExecution modelCompiled, strongly typed, predictable performanceInterpreted or JIT compiled, dynamic or gradually typed\nWebAssembly supportFirst class, highly optimizedWorks as host and integration layer\nDeveloper experienceSteeper learning curve but excellent tooling through Cargo and RustRoverVery fast iteration, strong tooling in VS Code and WebStorm\nEcosystemGrowing crates ecosystem and strong system level toolingLargest library ecosystem in the world\nIdeal role in hybrid stackPerformance engine under JS/TSUI layer, product logic, integration, DX\n\n\n\n\n\nRust\nIn 2024, Rust achieved a significant milestone, reaching an estimated 2.27 million developers, with 709,000 identifying it as their primary programming language. This year, Rust continues to gain traction in areas where performance and safety matter. Its commercial usage increased substantially – between 2021 and 2024, the share of Rust developers using it in production grew by 68.75%.\nRust’s ecosystem is thriving across industries, powering everything from operating systems and browsers to cloud infrastructure, WebAssembly apps, embedded devices, and blockchain platforms. Leaders like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta rely on Rust for its unmatched blend of speed, safety, and scalability – whether in the Linux kernel or the AWS Firecracker microVMs. \nThere’s another rising use case of Rust that points to its natural fit alongside JavaScript/TypeScript: web development. According to JetBrains ecosystem data from 2024, Rust for web development is the third most popular use case, showing how well Rust integrates with the web dev ecosystem.\nJavaScript / TypeScript\nJavaScript remains a ubiquitous choice among developers – it has the largest usage share among professional developers (68.8% in 2025). TypeScript’s tooling and large ecosystem adoption make it a strong “next step” for JS teams. To illustrate the rise of TS: in August 2025, TypeScript overtook both JavaScript and Python in GitHub contributor usage.\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons behind this expanding adoption are clear: the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems offer remarkable flexibility, making them one of the most powerful environments for modern software development. \nDevelopers can use both languages to build dynamic front-end interfaces and robust back-end services using frameworks like Node.js. This opens the door to developing full-stack applications with a single language. The speed and adaptability of JS/TS make them ideal for rapid prototyping, while the massive plugin and library ecosystems provide ready-made solutions for virtually any challenge, from UI frameworks to complex data handling. \n“Rust is undoubtedly the big star in JavaScript and TypeScript tooling and infrastructure. It addresses the most significant issue in the current tooling ecosystem: performance. And I’m 100% convinced that the safeguards from language and compiler make it easier to create successful tools to begin with.”\n\n            \nStefan Baumgartner\n                                                                Author of the TypeScript Cookbook and TypeScript in 50 Lessons\n                                    \nCommon Use Cases and Projects\nRust’s growing collection of web frameworks now mirrors many of the patterns familiar in JavaScript ecosystems, making it easier for teams to blend both worlds. Actix Web, Axum, Rocket, Warp, Loco, Cot, and full-stack tools like Leptos offer routing, middleware patterns, request handling, and component models that map conceptually to popular JS frameworks. \nFor example, Actix Web and Axum align with the role that Express or Fastify play in the Node.js ecosystem, while Leptos feels closer to React or Svelte in how it structures reactive UI logic, except it’s compiled to WebAssembly for performance.\nHow Rust Web Frameworks Map to Familiar JavaScript Patterns\nRust’s modern web frameworks feel approachable for developers coming from the JavaScript ecosystem. While they are different in typing and execution models, the core concepts like routing, middleware, handlers, and extractors follow patterns that JS developers already use daily.\nActix Web is known for its speed and mature async runtime. It uses an actor model that let’s you build highly concurrent services without complex coordination logic. For teams experienced with high-throughput Node servers or frameworks like Fastify, Actix Web offers a similar emphasis on efficiency, but with Rust’s predictability and stronger guarantees around memory safety and performance.\nAxum takes a modular, middleware-driven approach. It’s built on top of the Tower ecosystem, and it promotes clear separation between routing, request handling, and service composition. Developers who appreciate the flexibility of Koa or modern frameworks in the Deno ecosystem often find Axum intuitive because it leans on composable primitives and a clean, type-first design. If you want to see this approach in action, this short Axum tutorial walks through a real example. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket focuses on ergonomics. Its declarative routing and macro-powered syntax reduce boilerplate and make handler definitions straightforward. This resonates with developers who enjoy the expressiveness of decorator-driven frameworks such as NestJS, but want the reliability of a compiled language. With Rocket 1.0 stabilized, the framework has become a dependable option for production APIs and prototypes alike.\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these frameworks show how Rust’s server-side ecosystem has evolved into a space where JS/TS developers can transition smoothly, adopting familiar patterns with the added benefit of stronger safety guarantees and more predictable performance\nWhy These Frameworks Matter in Hybrid Architectures\nAs more teams blend Rust with JavaScript or TypeScript, frameworks like Actix Web, Axum, and Rocket become essential building blocks for the backend or core logic layer. They address the limits that Node services often encounter, especially under high load, CPU-heavy operations, or strict latency requirements. \nRust’s concurrency model and predictable throughput make these frameworks a strong fit for performance-sensitive backend logic, while JS/TS continues to drive the UI and application layer.\nThey also integrate cleanly with modern API tooling, making it easy to expose REST or gRPC interfaces that TypeScript clients consume reliably. For teams working with WebAssembly, these frameworks complement workflows where browser modules and backend services share Rust-based components. \nThe result is a hybrid architecture where JavaScript drives the user experience and rapid iteration, while Rust powers the critical paths that require precision and speed.\nRust’s WebAssembly Capabilities and JavaScript Integration\nWebAssembly serves as the practical bridge that allows Rust and JavaScript to collaborate within the browser. You can compile Rust directly to Wasm, allowing JavaScript to call into high-performance Rust functions whenever a task demands more speed or predictability than JS alone can provide. \nThis model is increasingly common as more teams use Rust-compiled Wasm for image processing, data visualization pipelines, physics simulations, cryptography, and other computation-intensive routines that would slow down or block a JS app if implemented purely in JavaScript.\nThe workflow is straightforward: JavaScript or TypeScript continues to handle the majority of the application, like UI rendering, event handling, state management, and routing, while Rust takes on focused, performance-critical modules. \nWhat you get is a JS/TS application with specialized Rust components quietly accelerating the hardest parts. \nMany teams now rely on this pattern, using Rust-powered WebAssembly modules to offload complex calculations while keeping the rest of the codebase in familiar JavaScript/TypeScript. It’s a complementary approach that strengthens modern web workflows without replacing established frontend practices (and causing lots of headaches!).\nReal-World Patterns for Introducing Rust Web Frameworks into JS/TS Workflows\nTeams adopting Rust alongside JavaScript and TypeScript often begin with incremental changes, using Rust frameworks as clean entry points into existing systems.\nA common starting point is replacing a single Node microservice with an Actix Web or Axum service, especially for tasks like data processing, authentication, or analytics where Node struggles under load. TypeScript clients generated from OpenAPI help keep the integration smooth.\nAnother pattern is using Rocket or Axum to build backend services for React or Next.js applications. These Rust services offer predictable latency under high concurrency, while the JS/TS frontend maintains flexibility and fast iteration cycles.\nFor teams working with WebAssembly, Rust’s web frameworks pair naturally with workflows where browser modules and server components share Rust-based logic.\nTogether, these patterns show how Rust frameworks extend JS/TS workflows by handling performance critical components without disrupting the broader development process.\nRust vs JavaScript: Ecosystem, Tooling, and Developer Experience\nEcosystem\nFor developers coming from the JavaScript world, the Rust ecosystem can feel both familiar and refreshingly different. JavaScript thrives on its extensive library ecosystem, rapidly evolving frameworks, and package managers. Rust offers a more streamlined environment, with its standard toolchain centered around Cargo, which serves as a unified build system, dependency manager, test runner, and project scaffolder. \nTooling\nOn the tooling side, JS developers often rely on WebStorm or VS Code, while Rust developers increasingly use RustRover, IntelliJ with a Rust plugin or CLion with Rust support for a more integrated development experience. \nAccording to the 2024 State of Rust Survey, VS Code remains the most commonly used editor for Rust, followed by Neovim and IntelliJ based IDEs, highlighting a split between lightweight editors and full featured IDEs depending on workflow preferences and project complexity.\nGet started with RustRover\n                                    \nCommunities\nWhen comparing communities, you can expect JavaScript’s scale to be unparalleled – reflecting decades of growth, numerous tutorials, and widespread industry adoption. Rust’s community is smaller but expanding rapidly, especially among developers seeking stronger safety guarantees or exploring alternatives to traditional Java-based backend stacks (this is why comparing Rust to Java makes so much sense!).\nDeveloper experience\nWhen surveyed using the JetBrains Language Promise Index, JavaScript sits firmly in the “mature and stable” category: widely adopted, battle-tested, and unlikely to fade. Rust, in contrast, scores high in terms of long-term potential and upward momentum. Its promise comes from a combination of safety, performance, and growing enterprise interest. These are traits that appeal to teams modernizing infrastructure or boosting their existing Java or JS stacks.\nIn practice, developers don’t have to choose between Rust and JavaScript. Rust brings predictability, performance, and modern tooling, such as Cargo and RustRover; JavaScript offers flexibility, a broad ecosystem, and a massive support network. Together, they form a complementary set of tools that let teams build faster, safer, and more maintainable software.\nDeveloper Adoption of Rust vs JavaScript\nRust learning curve and resources \nRust adoption today spans a wide range of organizations – from cloud platforms to fast-moving startups – giving the programming language solid credibility in real-world production systems. \nCompanies we all know, like Cloudflare, Figma, Discord, Amazon, and Dropbox, use Rust for performance-critical services, security-sensitive components, or infrastructure tooling. Startups building developer tools, edge runtimes, and data platforms increasingly choose Rust for its blend of speed and safety. \nIn the open-source space, many modern projects combine Rust and JavaScript, using Rust for core engines and JavaScript/TypeScript for the surrounding UI or integration layers. Examples include frameworks, linters, build tools, and WebAssembly-powered libraries that offload heavy tasks from JS/TS to Rust.\nIf you’re curious about how to get started after seeing these real-world use cases, our blog post How to Learn Rust walks through a practical learning path. \nStill, Rust’s learning curve can be steeper than JavaScript’s – especially in terms of the ownership and borrowing model. But once you understand these concepts, Rust tends to produce more predictable and maintainable systems. High-quality resources support this ramp-up: comprehensive documentation like Rust Book, courses and Rust exercises, and robust tooling such as RustRover. \nThis combination of industry adoption, open-source momentum, and strong educational materials makes Rust a reliable long-term skill for developers looking to expand beyond traditional JavaScript workflows.\nLearning curve and resources for JS/TS developers\nIf you’re a seasoned JavaScript developer looking to dip your toes into the world of Rust, you can use plenty of beginner-friendly resources, such as in-depth Rust guides or community-driven guides focused on WebAssembly and JavaScript integration. For experienced engineers who love to learn right inside the IDE, RustRover is a strong solution. You get a faster and more structured way to learn the language, thanks to its intelligent tooling, code insights, and smooth project setup.\nThe Rust community itself is a major advantage: active forums, Discord servers, meetups, and strong tooling support create a welcoming environment for newcomers. \nWhen exploring Rust, many JS/TS developers start small. For example, you can add a single Rust module to an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project to speed up a computationally intensive task, image transformation, or parsing operation – and then expand your Rust footprint as you gain confidence. \nThis incremental approach works well, especially in a job market where both junior developers (61%) and senior developers (54%) report challenges; expanding into Rust can open new opportunities without abandoning familiar JavaScript workflows. For JS/TS developers, experimenting with Rust isn’t about replacing what they know but enhancing their toolkit with a language that fits naturally alongside their existing skills.\nHow Rust and JS/TS Work Together\nModern teams are increasingly combining Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript in the same workflow, especially when performance is a key consideration. A common pattern is to compile Rust to WebAssembly and call it directly from JS/TS. \nThis is ideal for tasks such as data parsing, image processing, simulation code, or crypto routines, where Rust WebAssembly‘s performance offers a clear advantage. The approach complements the JS/TS side, which continues to manage UI, routing, and application logic. \nAs much as 85% of developers are already using AI assistants. The openness to adopt new tools opens the doors to experimenting with Rust and JavaScript hybrid architectures. \nJS/TS handles frontend and routine development tasks, while Rust modules (including those implemented via WebAssembly) take on performance-intensive tasks or critical backend services. This illustrates complementary usage without claiming one language is superior.\nExample: Calling a Rust-compiled Wasm module from TypeScript\nimport init, { compute_heavy_task } from \"./pkg/my_rust_module.js\";\n\nasync function run() {\n  await init(\"./pkg/my_rust_module_bg.wasm\");\n  const result = compute_heavy_task(500000);\n  console.log(\"Result:\", result);\n}\n\nrun();\nThis approach gives teams the best of both worlds: JS/TS drives the product experience, while Rust takes over for the parts that require speed, safety, or system-level control.\nCommercial usage of Rust and JS/TS: 3 Examples\nFigma\nFigma is a web-based design platform that pairs Rust and WebAssembly with a TypeScript- and React-driven interface. Its core graphics rendering and heavy computational tasks are compiled from Rust to Wasm, giving the browser near-native performance for operations like vector math, canvas manipulation, and real-time collaboration updates. \nMeanwhile, the application’s main interface, interaction logic, and overall user experience are built with TypeScript and React, allowing rapid iteration and a rich, responsive UI layer. This blend of Rust/Wasm for performance-critical work and JS/TS for product development speed is a central reason Figma feels both powerful and fluid inside the browser.\nBiome\nBiome is a performant toolchain for web projects. It provides developer tools that help maintain the health and consistency of those projects. It is designed to be used through LSP integrations in editors and the CLI to format and lint code.\nBiome is designed to be used through a CLI and editor integrations via the Language Server Protocol. While it supports both JavaScript and TypeScript projects, Biome itself does not rely on JavaScript or TypeScript internally. Instead, it replaces traditional JavaScript based tooling like Prettier and ESLint with a Rust implemented alternative focused on speed, reliability, and developer experience.\n“Biome aims to replace existing JavaScript tooling like Prettier and ESLint with a Rust-implemented toolchain that offers better performance and a more consistent developer experience.”\n\n            \nDenis Bezrukov, Core Contributor in Biome\n                                                        \nCloudflare\nCloudflare’s edge computing platform relies heavily on Rust to power its secure, high-performance serverless runtimes, including the foundation of Cloudflare Workers. Rust handles the low-level execution engine, network operations, isolation layers, and overall runtime reliability. \nOn top of this Rust-powered infrastructure, developers write their actual edge logic in JavaScript or TypeScript, which Cloudflare compiles and runs across its global network. This pairing enables Cloudflare to provide a fast and secure edge platform built on Rust while offering developers the familiarity and flexibility of the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript work best not as alternatives but as complementary layers of the same stack. Bringing together Rust’s speed, safety, and accuracy with the adaptability and rapid development of JS/TS provides teams with a well-rounded method that works for everything from web applications to backend systems. Hybrid workflows – whether through WebAssembly, shared services, or modular backends – let you select the appropriate tool for each part of your architecture. \nFor anyone exploring this path, experimenting with mixed Rust + JS/TS projects is one of the most effective ways to understand their combined strengths. And with tools like RustRover streamlining the Rust development experience, adopting these workflows has never been more accessible.\nIf you’re experimenting with Rust and JavaScript integration, RustRover provides a streamlined environment for managing your Rust toolchain, inspecting WASM, and working across hybrid projects.\nTry RustRover",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With more than 200 new members joining the JetBrains Content Creator community, we were bound to hear some exciting new things from them in 2025. Our members were steadily increasing in number, honing their YouTube videos, tirelessly keeping up with the posting schedule, and providing JetBrains perks directly to their audiences. But the real results of their work made us especially proud, so we decided to dedicate an entire article to our creators and their year!\nOur wins start with folks who improved their lives thanks to their unstoppable creativity:\n“One of my biggest accomplishments in 2025 has been taking my personal brand to the next level and turning it into something that now works very much like a company. This year I’ve been able to fully live off my content…largely thanks to the quality of the content and the steady growth of my community,”\n\n            \nsays Carlos Belenguer Jover, a TikTok creator and Twitch streamer working under the name @melenitasdev.\nThe growth, according to Carlos, is the result of people’s genuine desire to learn programming through accessible and fun content. To us, it was inspiring to hear how JetBrains products were a key part of that journey:\n“I use them daily in my own work and naturally across my videos and livestreams, and they’ve become deeply integrated into how I create, code, and teach.”\n\n            \nAn unexpected tool switch\nSome creator stories consisted of happy accidents, as was the case for YouTube creator Miguel Teheran:\n“My story started three months ago when my Windows laptop showed me a strange white screen and after that it couldn’t turn on again…I decided to buy a used MacBook and use the Apple ecosystem since I use macOS [at work] as well. I installed Rider [and] all of my content in my channel is now recorded with Rider and I am motivating people to try this tool.”\n\n            \nHitting massive reach and recognition\nFor all successful creators, personal highlights are connected to growth, and JetBrains creators grew big time in 2025. Anton Martynyuk’s newsletter at https://antondevtips.com has grown to more than 20K subscribers and Anton himself was recognized as a Microsoft MVP.\n“JetBrains tools have helped a lot on this journey, as I use Rider, DataGrip, AI Assistant, and Junie every day.”\n\n            \nThis wasn’t the first time Rider was mentioned to us. Adam Myhre frequently features it on the git-amend YouTube channel. As far as highlights go, Adam won Best Tutorial Series at Unity Awards 2025 and surpassed 2.5M views across his entire channel.\n“Rider continues to be a major part of every video! Thank you for your support!”\n\n            \nSome of our champions almost tripled their growth targets, like Luciano Souza’s YouTube channel and other social media:\n“In 2025 I’ve reached 140M views across networks (Instagram, X, and LinkedIn) and my goal was 50M through the year. I’m very happy with those results and all the effects that this brings to my career as a Software Engineer and Content Creator, and obviously JetBrains was with me on that.”\n\n            \nBeyond content: Books, OSS, and more\nTwo of our creators shone with projects outside of the content space: Jens Oliver Meiert wrote an entire book dedicated to web development, as did Ashley Allen, who published his Web Dev’s Guide to Freelancing.\n“It’s been a productive and impactful year, and I’m very happy about the results – thanks in good part to WebStorm!”\n\n            \n— Jens\n                                                        \n“I wrote the entire book in PhpStorm, using Markdown files for content, then wrote/ran scripts to generate the PDF and EPUB files. Being able to do all this inside PhpStorm was a massive help for my workflow because I could get instant feedback on the book as I was writing it, all without leaving my IDE. JetBrains also played a part in this book by providing a discount code for all the book’s readers, which I am incredibly grateful for!”\n\n            \n— Ashley\n                                                        \nHighlights for Ashley included using PhpStorm to maintain open-source Laravel/PHP packages totaling 3.1M downloads. For Jens, the entire year was dedicated to writing articles – more than a hundred of them – as well as various refactorings for Frontend Dogma and meiert.com.\nThese stories highlight something developers rarely talk about: using an IDE to manage the entire production – content, scripts, builds, and revisions – without constantly switching tools.\nLearning through community\nSeveral creators highlighted not just tools, but the broader ecosystem around them – from plugins and marketplaces to how new technologies reach developers. Saving the best for last, we decided to include Serena Sensini’s quote in full:\n“I’ve been using JetBrains tools for a long, long time, and I’m super happy to be a partner, because this gave me the opportunity to make our followers [explore] the different products you develop, but especially to give people [a chance] to explore different and innovative ways to code. Bringing emerging technologies to the community through the implementation of a huge marketplace and its plugins, your work with the external communication and community engagement, is incredible and I really need to thank you for that.”\n\n            \nThese stories go beyond individual wins. Creators’ workflows, feedback, and experiments shape how we think about the developer experience, tooling, and community. We’re grateful to everyone who shared their stories with us this year, with a special shoutout to Gerson Azabache Martinez, Ali Bouali, Artem Kondranin, and Faisal Memon.\nInspired by these stories?\nApplications to the JetBrains Content Creator Program are open. If you create developer-focused content and want support, tools, and a community that grows with you, we’d love to hear from you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Cameron Pavey, draft.dev.\nJenkins has served the development community well for over a decade, but it was designed for a different era of software development. Developers who are tired of fighting with plugin compatibility issues, slow builds, and brittle configurations are exploring alternatives.\nBut is your organization ready for the move? What is the actual work involved? And how do you communicate the benefits of a more modern CI/CD solution to leadership to get their buy-in?\nOur migration planning kit answers these questions:\nThe migration-readiness assessment scores and plots your organization’s readiness against the pain you’re experiencing with Jenkins to determine whether you are an ideal migration candidate, need to address foundational issues first, or ought to focus on other priorities.\nYou’ll see how Jenkins patterns compare to TeamCity to assess the effort required and plan for an effective migration.\nThe safe migration plan guides you through the five phases of a successful migration: discovery & assessment, pilot setup, incremental migration, optimization, and full cutover.\nYou’ll get templates and guidance on how to communicate the benefits of migration to management.\nThis guide contains a lot of information, so feel free to use the hyperlinks above to navigate to the information that’s most relevant for you right now.\nMigration-readiness checklist: Assessing your team’s preparation\nBefore considering any migration, you need an honest assessment of your current CI/CD maturity and readiness for change. The following self-evaluation will help you determine whether migration is the right next step and identify areas that need attention.\nOrganizational-readiness assessment\nStart by evaluating how your organization manages Jenkins infrastructure and pipeline development.\nDo you manage Jenkins centrally, or is it distributed across teams? Centralized management typically indicates better standardization and makes migration coordination easier. Distributed management may require more planning but often means teams have stronger pipeline ownership.\nDo you have standardized pipeline practices across your organization? If you have consistent patterns, shared libraries, and documented standards, you are typically better positioned for migration because you’ve already solved many of the organizational challenges. If your pipelines vary dramatically between projects, consider standardizing approaches before migrating.\nAre your builds reliable, or do you regularly experience flaky failures? This question reveals both technical debt and team practices. Reliable builds point to good testing practices and stable infrastructure, while frequent flakiness could be due to underlying issues that migration alone won’t solve.\nTechnical-inventory questions\nUnderstanding your current Jenkins footprint is essential for planning.\nHow many Jenkinsfiles do you maintain across all repositories? This gives you a scope estimate for the migration effort. Count both declarative pipelines and freestyle jobs that would need conversion.\nWhich Jenkins plugins are actively used in your pipelines? Create a comprehensive list including build tools, deployment integrations, notification systems, and reporting plugins. Research TeamCity equivalents for critical plugins, and identify any that might require custom development or workflow changes.\nDo you have custom integrations, scripts, or Jenkins extensions? Custom code represents the highest migration risk because it cannot be automatically translated to TeamCity: Each integration must be completely rebuilt using different APIs, often without clear documentation of the original business requirements or dependencies. Document any custom plugins, shared libraries, or external integrations that directly interact with Jenkins APIs.\nCI/CD pain point analysis\nConsider and identify the specific problems migration should solve for your team.\nAre your builds slow, or do you experience frequent bottlenecks? Common issues include slow build agents, inefficient artifact management, poor parallelization, and resource contention during peak hours. Having a clear goal is important as it will inform decisions throughout the migration process.\nDo you face debugging challenges regularly? Consider how much time your team spends investigating pipeline failures, tracking down build-environment issues, or understanding why tests behave differently in CI versus local environments.\nDo you have scalability issues that limit your current setup? Look for signs like build queues during busy periods, difficulty adding new projects, or infrastructure costs that grow faster than your team size.\nDo you want more control over your pipeline logic and infrastructure? If you are frequently working around Jenkins limitations or investing significant time in custom solutions, you would likely benefit greatly from TeamCity’s more flexible architecture.\nDo you need better visibility into flaky or slow tests? If your team struggles to identify unreliable tests or understand performance bottlenecks, TeamCity’s built-in test intelligence can provide immediate value.\nAre you spending more time maintaining CI infrastructure than building products? This is often the clearest signal that your current platform has become a productivity drain rather than an enabler.\nInterpreting your migration assessment\nLet’s now determine your readiness for migration.\nYou can find a printable version of this readiness checklist in the supporting files.\nFirst, calculate two separate scores:\nReadiness score:\nGive yourself 1 point for each “Yes”:\nCentralized Jenkins management\nStandardized pipeline practices across teams\nReliable builds with minimal flaky failures\nClear inventory of Jenkinsfiles and plugins\nDocumented custom integrations and dependencies\nPain score:\nGive yourself 1 point for each “Yes”:\nSlow builds or frequent bottlenecks\nRegular debugging challenges consuming team time\nScalability issues limiting growth\nNeed for more pipeline control and flexibility\nPoor visibility into test performance and failures\nMore time spent maintaining than building\nMigration recommendation\n\n\n\n\nLow readiness (0–3 points) + high pain (4–6 points): Address foundational issues first, but consider that TeamCity’s better tooling can help with cleanup. Start with organizational improvements and a small pilot.\nLow readiness (0–3 points) + low pain (0–3 points): Migration is not a priority. Focus on other improvements to your development process first.\nWhy choose TeamCity?\nKnowing when it’s time to migrate is only part of the puzzle. You also need to have a solid platform to migrate to. TeamCity addresses the core problems that drive teams away from Jenkins while providing capabilities that simply don’t exist in older CI/CD platforms. Consider the following, to list just a few:\nKotlin DSL for maintainable pipeline logic\nTeamCity’s Kotlin DSL provides type safety, IDE support, and compile-time validation. You can create reusable templates, refactor configurations with confidence, and catch errors before committing changes. Complex pipeline logic becomes maintainable code rather than fragile scripts that break unexpectedly.\nBuilt-in test intelligence\nFlaky test detection, automatic failure assignment, and a comprehensive test history are native platform features. TeamCity identifies which tests fail inconsistently, tracks patterns across builds, and assigns investigations based on recent changes. You’re not parsing logs or building custom solutions to understand test failures; the platform tells you what’s wrong and who should fix it.\nEnterprise orchestration without enterprise complexity\nBuild chains, artifact dependencies, and parallel execution work without extensive configuration or specialized expertise. Visual pipeline editors make complex workflows immediately comprehensible to new team members. You gain sophisticated orchestration capabilities without the operational overhead typically associated with enterprise platforms.\nHow do Jenkins pipelines compare to TeamCity?\nUnderstanding how your existing Jenkins patterns translate to TeamCity will help you determine what kinds of workflows you need to create as part of planning for an effective migration.\nPipelines vs. Build Chains\nTeamCity offers two complementary approaches for defining build workflows: Build Chains and Pipelines. Build Chains is an established method for modeling dependencies and complex workflows, while Pipelines, a new feature as of version 2025.07, provides a modern pipeline experience. While Pipelines is a newer feature that does not yet support as many use cases as the more battle-hardened Build Chains, it offers a more familiar and intuitive interface for teams migrating from Jenkins.\nThe specifics of the CI/CD processes you’re looking to implement will determine which option is best for you.\nOpt for Build Chains if:\nYou need mature, production-ready orchestration with advanced features like artifact dependencies, custom triggers, and snapshot isolation.\nYour workflows involve large monorepos or multiproject builds where many components must be built, tested, and deployed in a coordinated fashion.\nStability and long-term support matter more than having the latest pipeline syntax.\nOpt for Pipelines if:\nYou want a modern, YAML-based pipeline-as-code approach that feels closer to Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.\nYour workflows are relatively straightforward (build → test → deploy) and don’t require deep artifact or snapshot dependency modeling.\nYou value developer-friendly ergonomics and repo-first configuration over enterprise-grade complexity.\nSample patterns\nBoth Build Chains and Pipelines support Kotlin DSL for configuration (Kotlin DSL support is coming to Pipelines after 2025.11), which offers significant advantages over traditional Jenkinsfile syntax.\nThe following side-by-side examples compare common Jenkins pipeline patterns with TeamCity’s Kotlin DSL, showing syntax differences and TeamCity’s enhanced native capabilities.\nDeclarative pipeline definition\nJenkins’s declarative pipelines use a YAML-like syntax within Groovy that can become verbose and error-prone:\n// Jenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n\n    agent any\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Build') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh 'echo \"Building application...\"'\n\n                sh './gradlew build'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stage('Test') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './gradlew test'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stage('Deploy') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './deploy.sh'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity’s Kotlin DSL provides type safety and better IDE support:\n// .teamcity/settings.kts\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.*\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.buildSteps.script\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.triggers.vcs\n\nobject Build : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Build and Deploy\"\n\n    vcs {\n\n        root(DslContext.settingsRoot)\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Build\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"\"\"\n\n                echo \"Building application...\"\n\n                ./gradlew build\n\n            \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n        }\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Test\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./gradlew test\"\n\n        }\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Deploy\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./deploy.sh\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    triggers {\n\n        vcs {\n\n            branchFilter = \"+:*\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nTriggering builds on VCS commits\nJenkins requires either polling or webhook configuration with plugins:\npipeline {\n\n    triggers {\n\n        pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')  // Poll every 5 minutes\n\n        // OR\n\n        githubPush()  // Requires GitHub plugin\n\n    }\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Build on Commit') {\n\n            when {\n\n                anyOf {\n\n                    branch 'main'\n\n                    branch 'develop'\n\n                    changeRequest()\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './build.sh'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides native VCS integration with sophisticated branch filtering:\nobject BuildOnCommit : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Build on VCS Commit\"\n\n    vcs {\n\n        root(DslContext.settingsRoot)\n\n        branchFilter = \"\"\"\n\n            +:refs/heads/main\n\n            +:refs/heads/develop\n\n            +:refs/heads/feature/*\n\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    }\n\n    triggers {\n\n        vcs {\n\n            branchFilter = \"+:*\"\n\n            enableQueueOptimization = false\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Build Application\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./build.sh\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nEnvironment variables and configuration\nJenkins handles environment variables through pipeline syntax:\npipeline {\n\n    environment {\n\n        DATABASE_URL = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb'\n\n        API_KEY = credentials('api-key')\n\n    }\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Deploy') {\n\n            environment {\n\n                DEPLOY_ENV = 'staging'\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh 'echo \"Deploying to ${DEPLOY_ENV}\"'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides more flexible parameter management with type safety:\nobject Deploy : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Deploy Application\"\n\n    params {\n\n        text(\"database.url\", \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb\")\n\n        password(\"api.key\", \"credentialsJSON:api-key\")\n\n        select(\"deploy.environment\", \"staging\", options = listOf(\"staging\", \"production\"))\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script

stages and matrix builds\nJenkins’s conditional logic can become complex and hard to maintain:\npipeline {\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Deploy to Production') {\n\n            when {\n\n                branch 'main'\n\n                environment name: 'DEPLOY_PROD', value: 'true'\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh

approach become clear when you’re managing complex pipelines:\nType safety and IDE support: Your IDE can provide autocompletion, refactoring tools, and compile-time error checking for pipeline configurations. This eliminates the trial-and-error cycles common with Jenkinsfile development.\nReusability and modularity: You can create reusable functions, templates, and shared configuration objects. This reduces duplication and makes it easier to maintain consistent patterns across multiple projects.\nVersion-control integration: Kotlin DSL configurations are easier to review in pull requests, track changes over time, and understand the impact of modifications. The type system makes it clearer what each change affects.\nWhat does a safe migration plan look like?\nSuccessfully migrating from Jenkins to a more modern system requires a structured, phased approach that minimizes risk while incrementally proving value as you go.\nYou’ll get the most value out of your migration if you don’t treat it as a direct-translation exercise but as an opportunity to modernize and improve your CI/CD workflows.\nPhase 1: Discovery and assessment\nGoal: Understand your current Jenkins environment and identify the biggest challenges you want to overcome through migration.\nKey question: What are the most significant problems we want to solve by migrating, and how will you measure success?\nThe discovery phase involves conducting a comprehensive audit of your Jenkins instances and documenting all active jobs, pipelines, and their dependencies. Create an inventory that includes Jenkinsfiles, freestyle jobs, shared libraries, custom plugins, and external integrations. Pay special attention to identifying critical pipelines that cannot afford downtime and any custom functionality that might require special handling.\nThis audit should go beyond simple documentation. Ask what business goal each Jenkins pipeline was originally designed to accomplish. Many complex Jenkins configurations exist as workarounds for platform limitations rather than optimal solutions. Similarly, some pipelines may have evolved organically, accumulating complexity that can be eliminated in a fresh implementation.\nDuring this phase, engage with development teams to understand their pain points with the current system. Document specific examples of maintenance overhead, debugging challenges, and workflow inefficiencies. This information will guide your migration priorities and help you measure the success of your TeamCity implementation.\nPhase 2: Pilot setup\nGoal: Set up a low-risk TeamCity environment, and demonstrate core capabilities with a representative workload.\nKey question: Can you prove measurable value at a small scale before committing to a broader migration?\nChoose a pilot project that represents typical patterns in your organization but won’t impact critical business operations if problems occur. This might be an internal tool, a staging-environment pipeline, or a new feature-branch workflow. The goal is to validate TeamCity’s capabilities with real work while building team confidence.\nResist the temptation to simply recreate your Jenkins pipeline as is in TeamCity. Treat the pilot as an opportunity to implement best practices from the start. Use TeamCity’s visual build chains to clarify pipeline dependencies, leverage Kotlin DSL for maintainable configuration, and take advantage of built-in features like test parallelization and flaky test detection.\nSet up side-by-side comparisons where possible. Run the same builds in both Jenkins and TeamCity to compare performance, reliability, and developer experience. Document specific improvements, such as reduced build times, clearer failure diagnostics, or easier configuration management.\nCollect detailed feedback from the development team using the pilot system. Focus on daily workflow impact. Is it easier to understand build failures? Are configuration changes simpler to make? Does the system provide better visibility into test results?\nPhase 3: Incremental migration\nGoal: Migrate remaining pipelines based on complexity and business criticality while maintaining Jenkins as a fallback option.\nKey question: How can you migrate safely without disrupting team productivity or deployment capabilities?\nDevelop a migration priority matrix based on pipeline complexity, business criticality, and team readiness. Start with simpler, less critical pipelines to build expertise and confidence. Save the most complex or business-critical systems for later when your team has developed migration best practices.\nFor each pipeline migration, follow a consistent modernization approach. Review the original Jenkins implementation to understand its intended purpose. Then, design a TeamCity solution that accomplishes the same goals using native platform capabilities. This often results in simpler, more maintainable configurations.\nMaintain Jenkins pipelines in parallel during this phase so you can do quick rollbacks if issues arise. Use feature flags or branch-based routing to gradually shift traffic to TeamCity while keeping Jenkins as a safety net. This parallel operation also allows you to validate that TeamCity implementations produce identical results.\nUse Kotlin DSL consistently for new TeamCity configurations. This investment in type-safe, maintainable pipeline definitions pays dividends as your migration scales and more teams adopt the platform.\nPhase 4: Optimization\nGoal: Take full advantage of TeamCity’s advanced features to achieve benefits beyond basic pipeline migration.\nKey question: How can you unlock capabilities that weren’t possible with Jenkins to improve development velocity and quality?\nThis phase focuses on using TeamCity’s built-in intelligence and optimization features. Enable flaky test detection to automatically identify unreliable tests that waste developer time. Configure test parallelization to reduce build times and provide faster feedback on changes.\nImplement visual build chains to make complex workflows easier to understand and maintain. Use TeamCity’s dependency management to optimize resource utilization and reduce unnecessary work. Take advantage of TeamCity’s superior observability features. Set up dashboards that provide clear visibility into build performance, test results, and system health. Configure meaningful notifications that help developers focus on actionable issues rather than noise.\nConsider implementing TeamCity’s integration features with development tools like IDEs, issue trackers, and deployment platforms. These integrations can significantly improve developer workflow efficiency when working with TeamCity builds.\nPhase 5: Full cutover\nGoal: Complete the migration by retiring Jenkins and ensuring all teams are successfully operating on TeamCity.\nKey question: Are you confident enough in your TeamCity implementation to retire Jenkins and scale this success to other teams?\nEstablish comprehensive monitoring for your TeamCity environment before retiring Jenkins. This includes system performance metrics, build success rates, and developer satisfaction indicators. You want to catch any issues quickly and have data to demonstrate migration success.\nOnce you’re ready, create a formal Jenkins retirement plan that includes data archival, access revocation, and infrastructure decommissioning. Ensure you maintain access to historical build data and artifacts as needed for compliance or debugging purposes.\nDocument migration outcomes and lessons learned. Consider creating case studies that demonstrate measurable improvements in build performance, developer productivity, and system maintainability. This documentation will be valuable for expanding TeamCity adoption to other teams and for ongoing system optimization.\nIt may also be worth establishing an internal guild focused on CI/CD best practices with TeamCity. This group can help new teams adopt the platform effectively and continue evolving your implementation based on emerging needs.\nExplaining the migration to management\nTechnical migrations often fail not because of technology issues but because of inadequate stakeholder communication and buy-in. Leadership needs to understand both the business case for migration and the risk-mitigation strategies that make it a safe investment.\nKey benefits for leadership\nPresent migration benefits in terms of business impact rather than technical features.\nLower CI/CD maintenance overhead translates to engineering time that can be redirected from infrastructure firefighting to product development. Quantify this where possible: If senior engineers currently spend 10 percent of their time managing Jenkins, that represents a significant opportunity cost.\nFaster builds and deployment cycles directly impact time to market and customer responsiveness. Demonstrate how TeamCity’s optimizations can reduce feedback loops and enable more frequent releases. This is particularly compelling for organizations pursuing competitive advantages through rapid innovation.\nBetter test insights and quality visibility reduce production incidents and customer-impacting defects. TeamCity’s flaky test detection and failure-analysis capabilities help teams identify quality issues before they reach customers, reducing support burden and protecting brand reputation.\nRisk-mitigation talking points\nAddress leadership concerns about migration risk directly and specifically.\nTeamCity supports parallel CI environments, which means you can validate the new system thoroughly without disrupting current operations. This isn’t a risky “big bang” migration that puts business continuity at stake.\nNo full cutover is required until teams are ready, which allows for controlled, incremental adoption. Teams can migrate when they have capacity and confidence rather than being forced into arbitrary timelines that create unnecessary stress and risk.\nThe phased rollout approach means early phases can be reversed easily if issues arise, while later phases build on proven success. This creates multiple decision points where leadership can evaluate progress and adjust strategy based on actual results rather than theoretical projections.\nBusiness-case template\nBelow is a template you can adapt for your organization’s specific situation and leadership communication style. You can find an editable copy of this template in the supporting files.\nProposal: TeamCity Migration to Reduce CI/CD Maintenance and Improve Development Velocity\nExecutive summary\nOur engineering team is requesting approval to migrate from Jenkins to TeamCity for our CI/CD infrastructure. This migration will reduce maintenance overhead currently consuming [X hours per week] of senior engineering time, improve build performance by an estimated [Y percent], and provide better visibility into code-quality issues before they reach production.\nCurrent challenges\nOur [your team name] team currently experiences [current pain point] with our Jenkins infrastructure. For example, [pipeline example] requires [specific maintenance burden or performance issue]. These issues are consuming approximately [time estimate] of engineering capacity that could be better spent on [strategic initiatives].\nProposed solution\nTeamCity offers a modern CI/CD platform with built-in capabilities that address our current pain points:\nReduced maintenance: The Kotlin DSL configuration eliminates plugin-compatibility issues and provides IDE support for pipeline development.\nImproved performance: Built-in test parallelization and intelligent caching can reduce build times by [estimated percentage].\nBetter quality insights: Automatic flaky test detection and comprehensive failure analysis help teams identify issues faster.\nRisk mitigation\nThis migration uses a proven, low-risk approach:\nParallel operation: TeamCity will run alongside Jenkins during transition, allowing immediate rollback if issues arise.\nIncremental adoption: We’ll migrate one pipeline at a time, starting with noncritical systems to validate the approach.\nPilot validation: Initial implementation will focus on [specific low-risk project] to prove value before broader adoption.\nSuccess metrics\nWe will measure migration success through these metrics:\nEngineering efficiency: Reduction in CI/CD maintenance time from [current] to [target].\nBuild performance: Average build-time improvement of [estimated percentage].\nQuality indicators: Faster identification of test issues and deployment problems.\nTimeline and investment\nPhase 1 (discovery): [timeframe] – current system audit and TeamCity environment setup.\nPhase 2 (pilot): [timeframe] – single project migration and validation.\nPhase 3 (rollout): [timeframe] – incremental migration based on pilot results.\nRecommendation\nWe recommend proceeding with Phase 1 (discovery) and a pilot implementation. This low-risk initial investment of [resource estimate] will provide concrete data about TeamCity’s benefits for our specific use cases and inform decisions about broader adoption.\nNext steps\nWith your approval, we will:\nConduct a comprehensive Jenkins environment audit.\nSet up a TeamCity evaluation environment.\nExecute pilot migration with [specific project].\nReport our results and recommendations for Phase 3.\nPlease let me know if you have questions about this proposal or would like additional details about any aspect of the migration plan.\nConclusion: Making migration a strategic success\nJenkins isn’t an inherently bad tool: It served the industry well during the early days of continuous integration and enabled countless teams to adopt automated build and deployment practices. However, like many tools from that era, Jenkins was designed for constraints and expectations that were different from what modern software development teams face today.\nIf your team is spending more time maintaining CI/CD infrastructure than building products, experiencing frequent pipeline-reliability issues, or lacking visibility into build and test performance, migration to a modern platform like TeamCity represents a strategic investment in developer productivity and system reliability.\nThe key to successful migration is approaching it as a systematic, risk-managed process rather than a disruptive technology replacement. With the right planning framework, you can migrate safely while improving your development workflows and team efficiency.\nStart with the migration-readiness checklist to perform an honest assessment of your current situation and organizational readiness. This self-evaluation will help you determine whether migration makes sense for your team and identify areas that need attention regardless of platform choice.\nExperiment with Kotlin DSL samples to understand how TeamCity’s approach differs from Jenkins and what benefits it offers for your specific use cases. The type safety and IDE support alone often convince teams that the learning investment is worthwhile.\nExecute a focused pilot project to validate TeamCity’s benefits in your environment with real workloads and development patterns. This proof-of-concept approach allows you to make data-driven decisions about broader adoption while building team confidence and expertise.\nTeamCity is a modern, scalable CI/CD platform that supports powerful pipeline authoring via Kotlin DSL, built-in test intelligence, and visual pipeline chains. Whether you’re a team of five or five hundred developers, TeamCity helps you ship software with confidence through better tooling, clearer visibility, and reduced maintenance overhead.\nThe migration frameworks and templates in this guide provide the structure you need to execute a successful transition. However, every organization’s situation is unique, so keep in mind that you’ll likely adapt these approaches based on your specific constraints and requirements.\nReady to explore how TeamCity can improve your development workflow?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Previously in this series:\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 1: A Minimal Coding Agent\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 2: A Deeper Dive Into Tools\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 3: Under Observation\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 4: Delegation and Sub-Agent\nAgents eventually run out of context. When they do, they crash, and you lose everything mid-task.\nWe’ve been running GPT-5 Codex since Part 1. It scores 0.58 on SWE-bench Verified. We tried Claude Sonnet 4.5 next, which scored 0.6 and ran faster on most tasks. But complex problems hit Claude’s 200K context window faster. \nYou’ll probably find yourself switching models too, for better performance, lower cost, or to run locally. Sometimes that means smaller context windows, especially for local models limited by expensive memory. But even the biggest context windows fail on complex and long tasks. You can’t just keep buying more context.\nThe problem is that agents hold onto everything: every file, every command output, every search result, every user message. Eventually, there’s no room left.\nThat’s where compression comes in. But not the lazy kind that just drops old messages when you run out of space. Think about handing off a task to another developer. You don’t give them a transcript of everything you did. You tell them the goal, what files you changed, what worked, and what didn’t. That’s smart compression: Keep the context needed to continue; drop the verbose history.\nLet’s figure out how to implement this in Koog. First, we need to understand what strategy = singleRunStrategy() has been doing since Part 1. This is where you see how strategies control your agent’s loop and how you can modify them to create your own flow. We’ll examine singleRunStrategy(), and then build a version that compresses automatically. \nWhat that strategy line does\nIn the previous parts, you built a coding agent. You gave it tools, along with this line:\nstrategy = singleRunStrategy()\nHere, a strategy is the code that runs your agent loop. All strategies share the same core elements: call the LLM, execute tools, send results back, repeat. But they differ in when they stop and what they do between iterations.\nsingleRunStrategy() is the simplest possible version. It keeps iterating as long as the LLM returns tool calls. In other words: call the LLM → return tool call? → execute → call again → return text? → done.\n\n\n\n\nIt works fine for simple tasks. But on complex problems, the history keeps growing. Every command output, every file read, every search result stays in context. Eventually you hit the limit and crash mid-task.\nWhat we need instead is a strategy that runs the same loop but also checks the history size and compresses it when it grows too large.\nAdding compression\nWe’re swapping this:\nstrategy = singleRunStrategy()\nFor this:\nstrategy = singleRunStrategyWithHistoryCompression()\nThe loop is the same, but there’s now a checkpoint between Execute Tool and Send Tool Result. After each tool execution, the strategy asks:\nCheck: Is the history greater than the threshold?\nIf yes? Compress it: Extract the important facts. Drop the rest.\nIf no? Continue as usual.\n\n\n\n\nThat checkpoint is what lets your agent complete long-running tasks within tighter token budgets to avoid the error “context window exceeded”.\nBut you have to configure it. The strategy can’t guess when the history is too big or what facts matter for your task. You have to tell it two things: when to compress, and what to keep.\nWhen to compress \nFirst, you set thresholds – how many messages or characters you allow before compression kicks in:\nval CODE_AGENT_HISTORY_TOO_BIG = { prompt ->\n   prompt.messages.size > 200 || prompt.messages.sumOf { it.content.length } > 200_000}\nWhy these numbers? We experimented with different thresholds after seeing where errors appeared.\n\n\n\n\nThis agent hit 220K tokens and crashed. Claude’s limit is 200K tokens. We needed to compress before reaching that point.\nWe set compression at 200 messages or 200,000 characters, whichever comes first. Note that the code measures characters, not tokens. They’re different, but this threshold keeps us under the token limit – high enough to avoid over-compression, low enough to prevent hitting the limit.\nThese numbers aren’t fixed. If your agent hits the limit earlier, lower the threshold. Still completing tasks past these thresholds? Raise them. The choice depends on your use case: file sizes, message length, how verbose your tool outputs are, task complexity. Experiment and find what works.\nWhat to keep\nYou’ve set when compression triggers. Now choose what to keep.\nThere are two options: Either trust the LLM to decide what’s important, or tell it exactly what to extract.\nOption 1: Trust the LLM to summarize\nThe LLM decides what’s important using WholeHistory:\ncompressionStrategy = WholeHistory\nWhen compression triggers, Koog asks the LLM to create a TL;DR summary of the entire conversation history.\nBefore compression:\nAll messages up to the threshold: system prompt, user messages, assistant responses, tool calls, tool results.\nAfter compression:\nSystem prompt (preserved).\nFirst user message (preserved, so the agent remembers the original goal). \nOne TL;DR summary message (written by the LLM).\nThe tradeoff: This approach is simple and fast, but you’re trusting the LLM to decide what matters. Sometimes it keeps exactly the right details. Sometimes it drops something critical.\nOption 2: Tell the LLM exactly what to extract\nInstead of telling the model to summarize everything, you specify exactly what facts to extract using RetrieveFactsFromHistory:\ncompressionStrategy = RetrieveFactsFromHistory(\n   Concept(...),\n   Concept(...),\n   ...\n)\nHow it works:\nYou define Concept objects: specific questions about your task that the agent must remember. When compression triggers, Koog makes one LLM call per concept, sending the full conversation history each time and asking just that single question.\n\n\n\n\nWhy separate calls? LLMs get worse at answering when you ask multiple questions at once. We saw this in testing: Bundle eight concepts into one prompt, and some answers come back vague or incomplete. Ask them one at a time, and each response is more reliable.\nDefining a concept\nEach Concept instance has three parts:\nkeyword: a label for logs \ndescription: the actual question or instruction the LLM should answer \nfactType: the expected format of the answer\n\nMULTIPLE for lists\nSINGLE for single value\nConcept(\n    keyword = \"project-structure\",\n    description = \"What is the project structure?\",\n    factType = FactType.MULTIPLE\n)\nChoosing the right concepts\nFor our coding agent, the key question is: What information, if lost, would force the agent to start over? \nHere’s what happens when compression drops critical information:\nThe agent opens the same file twice as though it’s never seen it before.\nIt rewrites tests that already exist.\nIt drifts away from the task you originally gave it.\nEach failure shows what must survive compression:\nRe-exploring files → You need a project-structure concept.\nRedoing finished work → You need an important-achievements concept.\nLosing direction → You need an agent-goal concept.\nOur coding agent concepts\nWhen we tested on SWE-bench-Verified, we ended up with eight concepts. Here are three of them:\nval CODE_AGENT_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY = RetrieveFactsFromHistory(\n    Concept(\n        \"project-structure\",\n        \"What is the structure of this project?\",\n        FactType.MULTIPLE\n    ),\n    Concept(\n        \"important-achievements\",\n        \"What has been achieved during the execution of this current agent?\",\n        FactType.MULTIPLE\n    ),\n    Concept(\n        \"agent-goal\",\n        \"What is the primary goal or task the agent is trying to accomplish in this session?\",\n        FactType.SINGLE\n    ),\n    ...\nYour agent may need different concepts. The goal isn’t to copy the list; it’s to identify what state your agent needs to continue working and define concepts that preserve that information.\nYou can check out the full implementation of the eight concepts on GitHub. \nWhich model to use \nJust like with sub-agents (Part 4), you can use different models for different parts of the process. The retrievalModel parameters lets you specify which LLM handles the history compression. This parameter is optional – if not specified, compression uses your agent’s main model.\nretrievalModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4_1Mini\nHere’s the complete configuration for the coding-agent strategy:\nstrategy = singleRunStrategyWithHistoryCompression(\n   config = HistoryCompressionConfig(\n       isHistoryTooBig = CODE_AGENT_HISTORY_TOO_BIG,\n       compressionStrategy = CODE_AGENT_COMPRESSION_STRATEGY,\n       retrievalModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4_1Mini\n   )\n)\nThree parameters: when to compress (isHistoryTooBig), what to keep (compressionStrategy), and which model does the work (retrievalModel).\nConclusion\nAt this point, your agent can run longer tasks without hitting context limits. The compression problem is solved. Instead of crashing when it runs out of space, the agent compresses its history, keeping decisions and outcomes while dropping verbose outputs, and continues working within whatever token budget you have.\nIn this series, we started with a basic coding agent in Part 1. Since then, we’ve added tools, observability, sub-agents, and history compression. These five pieces give you what you need to build working AI agents in Kotlin that can operate within the constraints of real models.\nIf you want to keep building and practicing these patterns, planning and reasoning are interesting areas to explore: how agents decide what to do across multiple turns and how they break down complex problems. We didn’t cover those here, but they’re good practice once you’ve got these pieces working. \nThe full code’s on GitHub. If you run into any issues, leave a comment. We’re happy to help 😊",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve ever expanded a complex Unreal Engine variable in Rider’s debugger and had time to contemplate your life choices, this post is for you.\nWe’ve rewritten our expression evaluator, and the results are dramatic: Variable inspection is up to 87 times faster on warm runs and 16 times faster on cold ones. The debugger memory usage has dropped to just over a third of what it was. And there’s even a bonus benefit, but more on that at the end.\nThese improvements are already available for you to test in Rider 2026.1 EAP 1. But how did we get here? Buckle up – things are about to get very technical, but the payoff will be worth it.\nTest it in Rider 2026.1 EAP 1\n                                                    \nThe Natvis of it all\nVariable visualization is one of the most important features of any debugger. Without it, debuggers show just raw class fields – no array elements, no map contents, just raw pointers to memory, trees, and hash tables. There are many ways to tell debuggers how to display types nicely: pretty printers, data formatters, Natvis, and others.\nIf you use the MSVC C++ toolchain to build your programs, there’s a 99% chance you’re using Natvis. Natvis allows you to describe how to visualize your types. You can specify which items to show and describe that a type should be visualized as an array. Or, if you have a hash table, you can write complex expressions with temporary local variables, invisible to the debugged program, for extracting elements. Natvis also supports intrinsics – user-defined functions that prevent code duplication and make expressions more structured.\nTo understand what Natvis does, let’s look at a simple example with std::string using the standard stl.natvis:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the debugger must evaluate at least 6 expressions when you expand a simple string object.\nThe LLDB challenge\nRider supports Natvis, and uses it when you debug native C++ applications on Windows. But here’s the tricky part: Rider uses LLDB as its native C++ debugger, and LLDB doesn’t support Natvis natively. Instead, LLDB supports data formatters, which allow writing arbitrary Python code.\nWe thought we had it all figured out when we developed a special data formatter that implements Natvis support under Rider’s hood. The formatter parses Natvis files – matching types, creating items, generating summary strings, and building child hierarchies… Except we ran into some problems. \nWe had to use LLDB’s expression evaluator to evaluate Natvis expressions. This evaluator uses Clang under the hood, which is powerful but brings significant issues:\nMaintenance pains: Clang parsers are notoriously difficult to maintain. Sometimes, valid Natvis expressions simply wouldn’t compile, and debugging these failures was extremely challenging.\nPerformance problems: It’s slow – very slow.\nLimited intrinsic support: There’s no simple way to register and call intrinsics.\nMemory pollution: Declaring temporary variables for expressions injects those variables into the debugged process.\n\n\n\n\nTo work around these issues, we accumulated hacks everywhere. We had hacks in Clang, tried inlining intrinsics, and used top-level function declarations (an LLDB feature) for intrinsics that couldn’t be inlined. To improve performance, we cached Clang parsing results. But all these workarounds were unreliable and unstable.\nIf you use Rider for Unreal Engine, you’ve probably noticed that after updating the Unreal Engine version, TMap or TArray visualization sometimes stops working. This happens because Unreal.natvis becomes more complex with every update, and LLDB’s expression evaluator can’t handle the new expressions properly. Additionally, using LLDB’s expression evaluator within LLDB data formatters is fundamentally problematic.\nBuilding our own solution\nTo eliminate these issues, we decided to rethink how we work with Natvis entirely. Our first step: develop an alternative expression evaluator for Natvis without Clang. We knew about lldb-eval – another custom expression evaluator for LLDB that’s fast and powerful – but we wanted complete control, so we implemented our own evaluator from scratch.\nYes, we threw out an entire time-tested system and rewrote everything. Before you question our sanity, let us show you why it was worth it.\nThe results\nWe didn’t create artificial synthetic projects for testing. Instead, we used a standard Lyra game demo and created a script that recursively dumps variable children, emulating the scenario where you expand variables to see their contents. The script processes 6,000 values with two measurement scenarios: cold debugger (the very first evaluation, like a fresh debug session) and warm debugger (with all caches warmed up).\n\nColdWarmDebugger RAM usage\nStandard LLDB evaluator115 seconds7 seconds9 GB\nOur new evaluator7 seconds0.08 seconds3.5 GB\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s 16 times faster on cold starts and 87 times faster on warm runs! Plus, it takes just over a third of the memory as before. The difference is immediately noticeable during debugging. On massive Unreal Engine projects, the improvement is even more dramatic.\nThe bonus benefit we promised you\nOur new expression evaluator delivered two additional benefits we did not foresee.\n🎉 Core dumps finally work properly . The standard LLDB evaluator performs poorly with core dumps – almost every expression from Unreal.natvis fails, resulting in terrible visualization. With our new evaluator, Natvis works completely and reliably. The difference is striking:\nWhat Rider 2025.3 with the standard LLDB expression evaluator looks like in comparison to Rider 2026.1 EAP 1 with the alternative LLDB expression evaluator.\n\n\n\nPerformance is better across the board. Since this is a general expression evaluator, we also use it for:\nNormal expression evaluation (Add to Watches actions)\nConditional breakpoints\nWhile the performance boost here isn’t as dramatic and depends on the specific expression, even simple expressions make conditional breakpoints at least 20% faster. For complex expressions, the difference can be even larger!\nWhat do you think?\nThese improvements are already available for you to test in the Early Access Program builds for Rider 2026.1. Give one of the EAP builds a try (they’re free!) and let us know how much faster your debugging sessions become. \nTest it in Rider 2026.1 EAP 1\n                                                    \nIf you enjoyed this story, perhaps you’d also like a to know how we made LLDB’s stepping time 50 times faster in Rider.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We released Spring Debugger in May 2025 to bring more clarity to the “magic” behind Spring Boot – helping you see what’s really happening inside your running application. By the end of 2025, the plugin had reached more than 300,000 unique downloads and became a trusted tool within the developer community.\nWe’ve received a lot of valuable feedback, including feature requests, bug reports, and improvement ideas. Surprisingly, this was the most common question:\n“Can I debug remote applications?”\nIn this version, we’re happy to say that yes, you can.\nRemote debug with Spring Debugger\nWhen we started developing Spring Debugger, one of our cornerstone principles was:\n“We do not want to use any debug agents.”\nAdding agents to local code often makes setup harder, increases maintenance overhead, and can interfere with the debugging process. We decided to keep this approach for remote debugging as well.\nThe main challenge in remote debugging was gathering bean information after attaching to the app.\nIn the local setup, that’s simple – we set a non-suspending breakpoint in the method that finalizes Spring context initialization and then read all beans from the context. Remotely, however, the application is already running, and the context is fully initialized when we attach.\nContainer threading model and debugging\nOur current solution is to suspend one of the servlet-container threads and read the Spring context from that thread. This approach is where our decision to avoid using debug agents is truly tested.\nThe behavior of Spring Debugger depends on which embedded servlet container your Spring Boot app is using, as each container handles network I/O and worker threads differently.\nWith Apache Tomcat, the connector maintains a pool of worker threads as soon as the server starts. Because these threads are available and ready before any HTTP request arrives, the Spring Debugger can hook into one of them immediately after startup and fetch the Spring application context.\nBy contrast, with Eclipse Jetty or Undertow, the thread model is more layered. For example, Jetty uses separate producer (I/O) threads and worker (task) threads submitted to an Executor. \nUndertow uses I/O (event‐loop) threads for non‐blocking network handling and dispatches to worker threads for actual request processing. \nBecause a fully available worker thread with access to the Spring context can only appear once a request is processed, the debugger cannot load context information until the first incoming connection.\nIn short, when running on Tomcat, Spring Debugger can present the context immediately. When running on Jetty/Undertow, there is a slight delay in context loading before the first HTTP request. This is not a bug – it is a design trade-off linked to our agent-free inspection approach.\nYou can still debug remote Spring applications with nearly all Spring Debugger features – the main difference is when the context becomes available for inspection.\nHow to configure remote debugging\nThe process is the same as standard JVM remote debugging – run your application with an open debug port and connect using the Remote JVM Debug configuration.\nFor example, in a Docker Compose setup on a remote server:\nhttp-server:\n depends_on:\n   - postgresql\n image: 'jb/http-server:latest'\n environment:\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/db\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=user\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret\n   - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005\n ports:\n   - '8080:8080'\n   - '5005:5005'\n\n\n\n\nThe key line is:\nJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005\n\n\n\n\nThis is a well-known option for enabling remote debugging. It opens port 5005 for debugger connections and exposes it from the container.\nTo start debugging, create a Remote JVM Debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA and make sure to specify the correct module classpath.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it – you can now debug the remote application, inspect property values, evaluate bean expressions, and analyze transactions right inside your IDE.\nLimitations\nRemote debugging differs slightly from local debugging, but there are a few limitations:\nOnly embedded containers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) are currently supported.\nYou need to specify the module classpath in your run configuration.\nDatabase connections are shown, but the database structure view is not available.\nThe last point might be disappointing, but direct access to a remote database is often not technically possible – it may be inside a Docker network, a separate environment, or behind a firewall. We’re working on finding a solution, but this will take some time.\nConclusion\nThe new version of Spring Debugger takes another step toward application troubleshooting by adding remote attach support. Even if you’ve never tried remote debugging before, you’ll find the process almost identical to local debugging – just open a port and connect from IntelliJ IDEA.\nNo agents, no actuators, just a standard remote port and a regular debug session.\nSimply hit Debug and dive into your running application – inspect beans, properties, transactions, and use extended expression evaluation capabilities.\nWe’re exploring optional agent-based extensions for environments where deeper introspection is worth the trade-off, and we’d love to hear your feedback.\nHappy coding!",

Highlights include OpenAPI generation, Ztsd support for the compression plugin, duplex streaming for OkHttp, Structured concurrency integrations for the HTTP request lifecycle, and much more. For a detailed list of all the changes, check out the What’s new page.\nStability and performance\nWith its focus on stability and fixes for some long-standing issues, this release ensures Ktor is ready for another year of amazing development! \nBecause stability and performance remain among our top priorities heading into the new year, we want to invite all of you again to join the Ktor Early Access Program and help us test new versions and features. Start building your next project at start.ktor.io. Your suggestions and contributions are always welcome!\nGet Started With Ktor 3.4.0\n         \nOpenAPI generation from code\nIn 3.4.0, we completed the story for OpenAPI document generation by introducing a new API for dynamically documenting endpoints that works in tandem with a new compiler plugin. Now, instead of building your Swagger frontend from a static file, the model is built at runtime from details embedded in the routing tree.\nTo generate your documentation, you can enable it through the Ktor Gradle plugin, then it will automatically provide details in your code via the new describe API:\n/**\n * Our existing plugins work with the information found in the routes.\n */\nswaggerUI(\"/docs\") {\n    // Customize the result with general details\n    info = OpenApiInfo(\"KChat API\", \"1.0.0\")\n}\n\n/**\n * Get a list of messages.\n * \n * Query parameters: \n *  - search [String] a search query\n */\nget(\"/messages\") {\n    val query = call.parameters[\"search\"]?.parseQueryOrNull()\n    call.respond(messageTable.listMessages(query))\n}.describe {\n    // This code is generated from the code above\n    summary = \"Get a list of messages\"\n    parameters {\n        query(\"q\") {\n            description = \"a search query\"\n        }\n    }\n    responses {\n        HttpStatusCode.OK {\n            schema = jsonSchema<Message>()\n        }\n    }\n}\nDuplex streaming for OkHttp\nThe OkHttp client engine now supports duplex streaming, enabling clients to send request body data and receive response data simultaneously, in contrast to regular HTTP calls, where the request body must be fully sent before the response begins.\nDuplex streaming is available for HTTP/2 connections and can be enabled using the new duplexStreamingEnabled property in OkHttpConfig:\nval client = HttpClient(OkHttp) {\n    engine {\n        duplexStreamingEnabled = true\n        config {\n            protocols(listOf(Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE))\n        }\n    }\n}\nZstd compression support\nThe Compression plugin now supports Ztsd via the new ktor-server-compression-zstd module. Zstd is a fast compression algorithm that offers high compression ratios, low compression times, and a configurable compression level.  To set this level, call the zstd function from inside the compression block:\ninstall(Compression) {\n   zstd {\n       compressionLevel = 3\n       ...\n   }\n}\nHttpRequestLifecycle\nThe new HttpRequestLifecycle plugin allows you to cancel in-flight HTTP requests when the client disconnects, which is useful when you need to cancel a long-running or resource-intensive in-flight request. Simply install the HttpRequestLifecycle plugin and set cancelCallOnClose = true:\ninstall(HttpRequestLifecycle) {\n    cancelCallOnClose = true\n}\n\nrouting {\n    get(\"/long-process\") {\n        try {\n            while (isActive) {\n                delay(10_000)\n                logger.info(\"Very important work.\")\n            }\n            call.respond(\"Completed\")\n        } catch (e: CancellationException) {\n            logger.info(\"Cleaning up resources.\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nWhen the client disconnects, the coroutine handling the request is canceled, along with any launch or async coroutines started by it, and structured concurrency cleans all resources. This is currently only supported for the Netty and CIO engines.\n🚀 Thank you!\nWe want to thank everyone in the community for your support and feedback, as well as for reporting issues.\nStart building your next project at start.ktor.io.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Productivity Improvements\nThis month, we are bringing you a series of small yet long requested and popular features to let you better control and customize your editor.\nFast scrolling: Hold down the Alt key while scrolling the mouse wheel to move quickly when reviewing code or reading documentation. You can adjust the fast-scrolling speed in Tools > Options > Text Editor > Advanced > Touchpad and mouse wheel scrolling sensitivity.\nMiddle click scroll: Press down on your scroll wheel and move the mouse to quickly scroll through your document, making it easier to explore large files. This feature is off by default in 18.3 Insiders 2 and needs to be enabled via Tools > Options > Text Editor > Advanced > Middle click to scroll.\nHTML-rich copy paste: Visual Studio now supports HTML clipboard format when cutting or copying code from the editor. You can paste colorized code into web versions of Office apps, Azure DevOps work items, or other HTML-based controls. This feature is available in the latest Insiders and will be shipped in the Release channel soon.\nSyntactic line compression: Lines without letters or numbers are compressed by 25%, letting you see more code at once. Regular lines stay the same height. Enable this feature in Tools > Options > Text Editor > Advanced by checking Compress blank lines and Compress lines that do not have any alphanumeric characters.\nSlimmer left margin: We’ve heard you that you would like to see a slimmer left margin to have more horizontal space for your code! To save an extra column, we moved the Quick Actions icon (lightbulb or screwdriver) from the margin into the editor, where it appears inline with your code when fixes or refactoring are available. To try out the experience now, go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > Advanced and check Show Quick Actions icon inside the editor. We also have more customized margin controls coming, so stay tuned!\nColorized Code Completions\nCode completions are now colorized with syntax highlighting to help you quickly parse suggested code between variables, functions, and other elements! To try out this experience, go to Tools > Options > Text Editor > Code Completions and check “Use colorized text for code completions.”\nTo differentiate suggestions from actual code, colorized completions use lower opacity and italic styling. If you want to further customize the look, go to Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors and select “Code Completions” from the Display items list. From there, you can customize the font, size, foreground/background colors, and styles (bold, italicized…).\nClick to Accept Code Completions Partially\nHave you ever wanted to accept a code completion partially with a single click? With this new feature, you can click directly inside a suggestion to accept it up to the cursor position. As you hover over the suggestion, each segment highlights to show exactly what will be accepted.\n\nThis feature gives you more control over how much of a completion you want to accept. If you prefer using the keyboard, you can still press Ctrl + Right Arrow to accept one word at a time, or Ctrl + Down Arrow to accept one line at a time.\nStreamlined Markdown Preview Controls\nVisual Studio Markdown editor now gives you faster, clearer access to preview options:\nSwitch between preview modes: Split Preview shows the editor and preview side by side, Open Preview shows only the preview, and Edit Markdown shows just the editor. The preview-only mode helps you focus on rendered content, especially for large images or complex Mermaid diagrams.\nWhen previewing a Mermaid diagram, use the zoom controls in the top-left corner to zoom in or out for better readability.\nWhen Copilot Chat generates markdown content, click the Preview button at the top right corner of the chat window to see a rendered view. You can then edit and save the content directly. No need to copy and paste manually.\n \nTo try all this latest goodness, please update your Visual Studio regularly and join us in the Insiders Channel if you haven’t yet! (Note: All features shared in this blog post are available in Visual Studio 2026 only.) Please give them a try and let us know any feedback you have or the next thing you would like to see!\nThe post Visual Studio January Update — Enhanced Editor Experience appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

LargeSystemCache, DisablePagingExecutive  끄기\n혹시라도 이 설정을 켠 사람들은 아래 방법으로 끄면 된다. 먼저 regedit를 실행해서 레지스트리 편집을 시행한다.\nLargeSystemCache와 DisablePagingExecutive 설정\n\n\n여기서 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management 설정으로 이동하면 LargeSystemCache나 DisablePagingExecutive 설정이 보일 것이다. 이 값들은 on하는 것이 1이고, off하는 것이 0이다. 당연히 default값은 off인 0이다. 이 2가지 설정 값이 1이라면 0으로 수정하면 된다.\n \n혹시 이 값을 설정한 뒤에 페이징 파일(pagefile)을 0바이트로 설정했다면 원상복구하는 것을 추천한다. 원복을 위해서는 다음과 같이 sysdm.cpl 프로그램에 설정하는 것이 편하다. 먼저 Win + R 키를 누르면 나타나는 좌측 하단 입력창에 sysdm.cpl 을 타이핑해서 실행한다. 그리고 \"고급\" 탭에 \"성능\" 설정을 눌러서 \"성능 옵션\" 창을 띄운다. 여기서 다시 \"고급\" 탭으로 이동해서 \"가상 메모리\"의 변경 버튼을 누르면 아래 그림처럼 가상 메모리 설정을 볼 수 있다. 가상메모리 설정을 \"시스템이 관리하는 크기\"로 설정하면 원상복구가 된다. 간혹 가상메모리 크기를 고정값으로 \"사용자 지정 크기\" 로 16GB로 해두는게 좋다는 글도 있는데, 다 십수년전 옛날 설정 이야기다. 2026년 기준으로 보면 쓸데없는 설정이다.\nsysdm.cpl의 성능옵션, 가상 메모리 설정\n\n\n윈도10이나 윈도11은 옛날처럼 최적화 하는 기법이 대부분 작동하지 않는다. 오히려 요새 최적화 기법은 발열이 심각한 몇몇 랩탑의 CPU나 올인원 PC들의 CPU 성능을 80% 정도로 낮추는 기능이 유용하고, 알림을 꺼서 최적화 하는 정도만 제대로 쓸모가 있다. 그 외에는 그냥 디폴트 값을 쓰는게 좋다. 괜히 만져서 더 느려지거나 문제가 생길 수 있으니 주의하도록 하자.\n그러나 굳이 꼭 쓰고 싶다면 위에 레지스트리를 고쳐서 LargeSystemCache 정도만 쓰는 것을 추천한다. 간혹 엄청난 문서 파일들을 작업하거나 동영상 같은 것을 편집하는 경우에는 아주 조금 유용할 수는 있을 듯 하다.\n \n레퍼런스\n[1] 페이징 파일 소개, Microsoft Learn, https://learn.microsoft.com/ko-kr/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/introduction-to-the-page-file?source=recommendations\n[2] LargeSystemCache에 대한 설명, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc784562(v=ws.10)\n[3] DisablePagingExecutive 에 대한 설명, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/wpr-command-line-options\n \n \n히스토리\n2026.01.23 문서를 처음으로 작성",

PURE GLOW는 대표적인 필름 스톡을 모방한 필터를 제공하여 이러한 아날로그적인 느낌을 연출할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>코닥 포트라 400:</b> 따뜻하고 부드러운 색감으로, 특히 피부 톤을 아름답게 표현하는 데 탁월합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>후지 400H:</b> 살짝 차갑고 청량한 느낌으로, 현대적인 감성을 더할 때 유용합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>코닥 골드 200:</b> 따뜻하고 빈티지한 느낌을 선사하여 아련한 분위기를 연출할 수 있습니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">또한, 필름 사진 특유의 미세한 입자감, 즉 <b>그레인(Grain)</b> 효과는 오히려 이미지에 자연스럽고 따뜻한 감성을 불어넣어줍니다. PURE GLOW에서는 이러한 디테일한 옵션까지 조절할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; padding-left: 10px; border-left: 3px solid #1a73e8;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>2. 혼합광: 실제 환경의 빛을 재현하라</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">실제 실내 환경을 생각해보면, 단 하나의 광원만 있는 경우는 거의 없습니다. 창문으로 들어오는 차가운 자연광, 천장의 따뜻한 램프 조명 등 여러 광원이 섞여있는 것이 현실이죠. PURE GLOW의 <b>'아침 창가광'</b> 같은 조명 설정은 이처럼 복합적인 혼합광 효과를 재현하여 이미지에 극도의 사실감을 부여합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>팁:</b> 자연스러운 혼합광은 인물의 입체감을 살리고 그림자를 부드럽게 만들어, AI 이미지가 가진 평면적인 느낌을 효과적으로 줄여줍니다.</div>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; padding-left: 10px; border-left: 3px solid #1a73e8;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>3. 재질감: 고급스러움과 현실감의 결정적 요소</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">의상 설명을 할 때 단순히 &ldquo;예쁜 원피스&rdquo;라고 하는 대신, <b>&ldquo;실크 소재의 은은하게 빛나는 원피스&rdquo;</b>처럼 재질을 구체적으로 지정하는 것이 중요합니다. 재질마다 빛을 받았을 때 반사되는 방식이 다르기 때문이에요. 실크는 은은한 광택을, 린넨은 거친 반사를, 캐시미어는 부드러운 빛 흡수를 보여주죠. PURE GLOW 앱에서는 이러한 재질감 옵션을 세밀하게 조절하여 의상과 배경의 현실감을 높일 수 있습니다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bi9GKZ/dJMcadtZtAs/2NGKBlMbb8YNNj8h8q41I1/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bi9GKZ/dJMcadtZtAs/2NGKBlMbb8YNNj8h8q41I1/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bi9GKZ/dJMcadtZtAs/2NGKBlMbb8YNNj8h8q41I1/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fbi9GKZ%2FdJMcadtZtAs%2F2NGKBlMbb8YNNj8h8q41I1%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null;

        "contentSnippet": "혹시 AI로 만든 인물 이미지가 너무 부자연스러워서 실망한 적 있으신가요? 오늘은 플라스틱 같은 피부, 인형 같은 눈동자 등 이른바 ‘AI 티’ 나는 이미지를 피하고, 모공, 잡티, 솜털까지 섬세하게 표현하는 극사실적인 AI 인물 사진을 만드는 방법을 알려드립니다. 혁신적인 PURE GLOW 앱을 통해 조명, 카메라, 피부 질감, 움직임의 4가지 핵심 원칙을 적용하여 실제 사진처럼 보이는 이미지를 만드는 비법을 최신 정보로 공개합니다.\n\n\n✨ AI 인물 이미지, 왜 '진짜' 같지 않을까?\nAI 기술이 급속도로 발전하면서 이미지 생성 능력도 놀라워졌죠. 그런데 인물 사진만큼은 여전히 어딘가 어색하고 부자연스럽다는 느낌을 지울 수 없습니다. 분명히 “사실적인 인물 사진을 생성해줘”라고 요청했는데, 결과물은 플라스틱 같은 피부나 인형 같은 눈동자를 가진 이미지일 때가 많아요. 이를 우리는 흔히 “AI 티”가 난다고 표현하곤 합니다.\n이런 이미지를 SNS 피드나 블로그 포스팅 섬네일에 사용하면 어떤 일이 벌어질까요? 유저들은 한눈에 “아, 이건 그냥 대충 만든 이미지네”라는 인상을 받게 되고, 이는 곧 서비스나 콘텐츠에 대한 신뢰도 하락으로 이어지기 쉽습니다. 저도 이런 경험이 참 많았어요. 완벽한 것 같으면서도 어딘가 부족한, 이른바 ‘불쾌한 골짜기(Uncanny Valley)’ 현상이 바로 그 원인입니다.\n  제미나이와 함께 찾아낸 극사실 이미지의 비밀\n그렇다면 어떻게 해야 AI 티 없이 실제 사진처럼 보이는 극사실적인 인물 이미지를 만들 수 있을까요? 저는 이 질문을 제미나이(Gemini)에게 던져서 핵심 인사이트를 얻었습니다. 그리고 그 인사이트를 바탕으로 'PURE GLOW'라는 AI 인물 이미지 생성 앱을 직접 만들어봤어요. 제미나이의 답변은 정말 체계적이고 구체적이었습니다.\n제미나이는 AI 이미지가 부자연스러운 주된 이유로 너무 매끈한 피부, 완벽한 대칭, 과한 색감 등을 꼽았으며, 이를 해결하기 위한 네 가지 핵심 원칙을 제시했습니다. 바로 구체적인 시간대의 빛 지정, 실제 렌즈 스펙 활용, 피부의 불완전함 구현, 살아있는 움직임 담기입니다. 또한, 앱 개발 시 필요한 조명 설정, 카메라 설정, 피부 질감 옵션, 포즈 라이브러리, 필름 스톡 같은 기능들도 상세하게 제안했죠. 이제 이 인사이트들을 바탕으로 AI 이미지의 10가지 흔한 실수와 고급 테크닉을 자세히 살펴보겠습니다.\n  AI 티를 내는 10가지 흔한 실수와 개선 방안\n먼저, 왜 AI 이미지가 이상해 보이는지부터 정확히 아는 것이 중요합니다. 제미나이가 알려준 10가지 결정적인 실수를 파악하고 피하면, 여러분의 AI 이미지 퀄리티가 확연히 달라질 거예요. 제가 직접 이미지를 생성하며 겪었던 문제점들이기도 합니다.\n너무 매끈한 피부: AI는 기본적으로 완벽한 피부를 만들려 하지만, 실제 사람은 모공, 미세한 잡티, 솜털이 있어야 자연스럽습니다. 피부의 불완전함을 표현하는 디테일이 핵심이에요.\n완벽한 좌우 대칭: 사람의 얼굴은 완벽하게 대칭적이지 않습니다. 한쪽 눈썹이 살짝 높거나 입꼬리가 약간 다른 등 미묘한 비대칭이 오히려 자연스러움을 더하죠.\n비현실적인 눈동자: 너무 크거나 과하게 반짝이는 눈동자는 인형처럼 보입니다. 실제 눈은 주변 환경의 빛을 자연스럽게 반사하는 그 느낌이 중요해요.\n배경이나 간판의 깨진 글자: AI가 생성한 텍스트는 종종 이상하게 깨져 나옵니다. 배경에 간판이나 로고가 있다면, 아예 텍스트를 제외하는 것이 좋습니다.\n머리카락이 한 덩어리로 뭉쳐있음: 플라스틱 가발처럼 보이는 머리카락은 부자연스럽습니다. '바람에 자연스럽게 흩날리는 머리카락'처럼 디테일을 추가해야 합니다.\n배경이 너무 비현실적: 지나치게 깔끔하거나 과도하게 흐려진 배경은 오히려 어색해요. 실제 사진처럼 자연스러운 디테일과 보케(아웃포커싱)가 필요합니다.\nHDR처럼 색감이 과도함: 너무 선명하고 강렬한 색감은 게임 그래픽처럼 보일 수 있습니다. 좀 더 미묘하고 자연스러운 색감이 실제 사진에 가깝습니다.\n디테일이 지나치게 선명함: 모든 부분이 똑같이 선명하면 부자연스럽습니다. 실제 사진은 초점 맞은 부분만 선명하고 나머지는 살짝 흐릿하게 표현됩니다.\n포즈가 너무 과도함: 억지스러운 모델 화보 같은 포즈보다는 자연스러운 일상적 순간을 포착한 느낌이 훨씬 리얼합니다.\n조명이 너무 완벽함: 스튜디오 조명처럼 그림자가 전혀 없고 모든 것이 균일하게 밝으면 인공적으로 보입니다. 실제 환경은 빛과 그림자의 자연스러운 대비가 있어야 합니다.\n이 10가지 실수만 제대로 피해도 AI 이미지의 '티'는 정말 확연히 줄어들 것입니다. 저도 이 점들을 유의하면서 PURE GLOW 앱을 개발하고 사용하고 있습니다. 물론 처음부터 완벽하게 구현하기는 어렵지만, 꾸준히 시도하면 분명 좋은 결과를 얻을 수 있을 거예요.\n\n\n  극사실 표현을 위한 고급 테크닉: PURE GLOW의 핵심 원리\n앞서 언급된 실수들을 피하는 것을 넘어, 한 차원 높은 리얼리티를 구현하기 위한 제미나이의 고급 조언들이 있었습니다. PURE GLOW 앱은 이러한 기법들을 옵션으로 제공하여 사용자가 쉽게 적용할 수 있도록 했습니다.\n1. 필름 룩: 디지털 느낌을 없애고 아날로그 감성 더하기\n디지털 이미지는 때로 너무 선명하고 색감이 강렬해서 인공적으로 보입니다. 반면 실제 필름 카메라로 찍은 사진은 색이 좀 더 부드럽고 미묘하며, 특유의 감성을 담고 있죠. PURE GLOW는 대표적인 필름 스톡을 모방한 필터를 제공하여 이러한 아날로그적인 느낌을 연출할 수 있습니다.\n코닥 포트라 400: 따뜻하고 부드러운 색감으로, 특히 피부 톤을 아름답게 표현하는 데 탁월합니다.\n후지 400H: 살짝 차갑고 청량한 느낌으로, 현대적인 감성을 더할 때 유용합니다.\n코닥 골드 200: 따뜻하고 빈티지한 느낌을 선사하여 아련한 분위기를 연출할 수 있습니다.\n또한, 필름 사진 특유의 미세한 입자감, 즉 그레인(Grain) 효과는 오히려 이미지에 자연스럽고 따뜻한 감성을 불어넣어줍니다. PURE GLOW에서는 이러한 디테일한 옵션까지 조절할 수 있습니다.\n2. 혼합광: 실제 환경의 빛을 재현하라\n실제 실내 환경을 생각해보면, 단 하나의 광원만 있는 경우는 거의 없습니다. 창문으로 들어오는 차가운 자연광, 천장의 따뜻한 램프 조명 등 여러 광원이 섞여있는 것이 현실이죠. PURE GLOW의 '아침 창가광' 같은 조명 설정은 이처럼 복합적인 혼합광 효과를 재현하여 이미지에 극도의 사실감을 부여합니다.\n  팁: 자연스러운 혼합광은 인물의 입체감을 살리고 그림자를 부드럽게 만들어, AI 이미지가 가진 평면적인 느낌을 효과적으로 줄여줍니다.\n3. 재질감: 고급스러움과 현실감의 결정적 요소\n의상 설명을 할 때 단순히 “예쁜 원피스”라고 하는 대신, “실크 소재의 은은하게 빛나는 원피스”처럼 재질을 구체적으로 지정하는 것이 중요합니다. 재질마다 빛을 받았을 때 반사되는 방식이 다르기 때문이에요. 실크는 은은한 광택을, 린넨은 거친 반사를, 캐시미어는 부드러운 빛 흡수를 보여주죠. PURE GLOW 앱에서는 이러한 재질감 옵션을 세밀하게 조절하여 의상과 배경의 현실감을 높일 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  PURE GLOW 앱으로 만드는 '진짜' 같은 AI 인물 이미지\n제가 제미나이의 인사이트를 바탕으로 개발한 PURE GLOW 앱은 위에 언급된 모든 원칙과 고급 테크닉들을 손쉽게 적용할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 2026년 현재, 이 앱은 나노 바나나 프로(Nano Banana Pro) API를 활용하여 구체적인 설정값만 입력하면 누구든지 클릭 몇 번으로 극사실적인 AI 인물 이미지를 만들 수 있도록 돕습니다.\n\n\nPURE GLOW의 기본 기능\nPURE GLOW의 기본 설정은 다음과 같이 구성되어 있습니다:\n카테고리\n주요 설정 옵션\n\n\n\n\n외형 설정\n성별, 국적, 나이, 헤어스타일\n\n\n인물 디테일\n표정, 포즈, 의상, 장소\n\n\n사실감 강화\n조명 및 카메라 설정, 피부 질감 (모공, 잡티, 솜털)\n\n\n필터 및 기타\n필름 필터(코닥 포트라 400 등), 랜덤 생성 기능\n\n\n\n예를 들어, 20대 한국 여성에 오버사이즈 화이트 셔츠, 도서관 장소, 은은한 미소와 벽에 기대는 포즈, 아침 창가광 조명, 폰 카메라 후면 장비, 코닥 포트라 400 필름 필터, 그리고 초정밀 모공, 사실적 잡티, 솜털까지 적용한 피부 질감을 선택하면, 실제로 촬영한 것과 같은 높은 퀄리티의 이미지를 얻을 수 있습니다.\nPURE GLOW Pro: AI 인플루언서 기능으로 확장된 활용성\nPURE GLOW 프로 버전은 단순한 이미지 생성을 넘어, 가상 인플루언서의 하루 일과나 특정 이벤트를 AI가 자동으로 생성하고 여기에 광고까지 포함할 수 있는 획기적인 기능을 제공합니다. 이 기능은 특히 소셜 미디어 콘텐츠 제작자나 마케터에게 유용할 것입니다.\n인물 설정을 마친 후 '랜덤 일과'를 클릭하면 시간대별로 다양한 이벤트 목록이 생성되며, 이를 기반으로 레퍼런스 이미지를 등록하거나 바로 이미지를 생성하여 가상 인플루언서의 특별한 하루를 연출할 수 있습니다. 또한, 사용자가 직접 'AI 플래닝 입력 창'에 간단한 하루 일정을 입력하면, AI가 이를 바탕으로 맞춤형 이벤트 목록을 생성해주기도 합니다.\n  주목: 광고 모드에서는 특정 광고 유형을 선택하고 상품 사진과 제품명을 입력하면, 선택한 이벤트와 상품이 자연스럽게 적용된 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다. 이는 제품 홍보 콘텐츠 제작에 혁신적인 변화를 가져올 거예요.\n생성된 이미지와 함께 인스타그램에 바로 올릴 수 있는 적절한 캡션과 해시태그까지 자동으로 제공되니, 콘텐츠 제작 과정이 훨씬 간편해집니다. 만약 캡션이 마음에 들지 않는다면 '다시 생성' 버튼을 클릭하여 새로운 캡션을 받아볼 수도 있습니다. 제가 직접 해보니 정말 편리하고 아이디어를 얻기에도 좋았습니다.\n \n\n \nPureGlow: AI Influencer Studio\n \npure-glow-basic.vercel.app\n\n \n  핵심 요약: PURE GLOW가 선사하는 AI 이미지의 새 지평\n  핵심 요약\n1.

        "contentSnippet": "이더넷 케이블, 겉모습은 다 같아 보이지만 사실은 색상별로 숨겨진 의미가 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 흔히 성능이나 속도를 나타낸다고 오해하기 쉽지만, 이 색상 코드에는 우리가 미처 몰랐던 진짜 활용법과 네트워크 관리의 비밀이 숨어있습니다. 오늘은 이더넷 케이블의 외부 재킷 색상부터 내부 전선의 복잡한 색상 코드까지, 그 흥미로운 세계를 함께 탐험해볼까 합니다. 과연 색상들이 어떤 역할을 하는지, 또 어떤 점에 주의해야 하는지 최신 정보를 바탕으로 자세히 알아볼게요!\n\n\n이더넷 케이블 외부 색상, 그 진짜 의미는?  \n음, 우리가 흔히 보는 이더넷 케이블들, 그냥 다 똑같이 생겼다고 생각하셨을 거예요. 파란색, 노란색, 빨간색, 초록색, 회색 심지어 분홍색까지 다양하게 있긴 하지만, 사실 그냥 예쁘라고 만든 건 아니거든요. 많은 분들이 USB 포트 색깔처럼 속도나 성능을 나타내는 게 아닐까 오해하시곤 하는데, 그건 정말 아니에요. 이 케이블 색상들은 단순히 시각적인 요소도 아니고, 성능과도 전혀 무관하답니다.\n그렇다면 왜 이렇게 다양한 색깔이 존재할까요? 바로 \"조직화\"와 \"명확성\" 때문입니다. 상상해보세요. 복잡한 데이터 센터나 사무실에서 수백 가닥의 케이블이 얽혀있는 모습을요. 그때 특정 색깔의 케이블이 어떤 용도로 쓰이는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있다면 얼마나 편리할까요?\n  잠깐! 여기서 말하는 색상 코드는 케이블 외부 재킷의 색깔을 의미합니다. 케이블 내부에 꼬여있는 전선들의 색상 코드는 연결성과 신호 전송에 매우 중요한 역할을 하는데, 이건 나중에 따로 자세히 이야기해 드릴게요. 착각하시면 안 돼요!\n대규모 네트워크 환경에서는 말할 것도 없고요, 집에서도 유용해요. 여러분의 라우터, 스위치, 모뎀 연결에 각기 다른 색상의 케이블을 사용하면, 갑자기 네트워크가 안 될 때 문제의 원인을 훨씬 쉽게 찾아낼 수 있답니다. 정말 작은 차이 같지만, 실제로 써보면 엄청난 편리함을 가져다주죠.\n이 외에도 제조사들은 케이블 카테고리(예: Cat 5, Cat 6, Cat 7)를 구분하거나, 케이블 길이, 심지어는 설치 연도(예: 2025년 설치는 파란색, 2026년 설치는 노란색)를 나타내는 데 색상을 활용하기도 합니다. 결국, 케이블 색상은 작업과 유지보수를 더 빠르고 덜 헷갈리게 만드는 데 큰 도움을 준다고 볼 수 있어요. 성능에 영향을 주진 않지만, 네트워크 관리의 효율성에는 지대한 영향을 끼치는 거죠.\n주요 색상별 용도, 과연 정해진 규칙이 있을까?  \n자, 그렇다면 각 색상들이 정확히 어떤 의미를 가지고 있을까요? 음… 사실은 정해진 \"만국 공통\" 표준은 없어요. 이 점이 좀 중요합니다. 케이블 색상의 의미는 특정 조직, 공급업체 또는 설치자가 어떻게 사용하기로 결정했는지에 따라 전적으로 달라질 수 있어요. 하지만 제가 겪어본 바로는, 몇 가지 흔한 패턴은 분명히 존재합니다.\n  파란색: 대부분 표준 네트워크 연결에 사용돼요. 데스크톱 컴퓨터, 노트북 독, 사무실 프린터 등을 네트워크 스위치나 라우터에 연결할 때 말이죠. 가장 보편적이죠!\n  노란색: PoE(Power over Ethernet) 장치에 자주 사용됩니다. IP 보안 카메라, VoIP 전화, 무선 액세스 포인트처럼 케이블 자체에서 전력을 공급받는 장치들이요.\n⬛ 검은색 또는 회색: 사무실이나 가정에서 일상적인 연결에 많이 쓰입니다. 라우터를 모뎀에 연결하거나, 게임 콘솔을 네트워크 스위치에 연결하는 경우처럼요. 저도 집에서 주로 회색 케이블을 쓰고 있어요.\n  빨간색: 이건 정말 중요한 연결에만 사용되는 경우가 많습니다. 서버, 방화벽, 비상 백업 시스템처럼 절대로 연결이 끊기면 안 되는 곳에요. 때로는 제한되거나 보안이 강화된 네트워크 구간을 나타내기도 해요.\n  녹색: 크로스오버 연결(두 개의 유사한 장치를 직접 연결할 때, 예: 스위치-스위치 또는 컴퓨터-컴퓨터)이나 스마트 온도 조절기, 빌딩 제어 시스템 같은 환경 시스템에 사용되기도 합니다.\n  주황색 또는   보라색: 비교적 드물지만, 테스트 환경, 외부 연결, 게스트나 계약자를 위한 VLAN 세그먼트와 같은 특별한 네트워크 기능에 사용될 수 있어요.\n\n\n⚠️ 경고! 다시 한번 강조하지만, 위에 설명된 색상별 의미는 보편적인 표준이 아닙니다. 색상이 어떤 용도를 암시할 수는 있지만, 중요한 장비를 연결하거나 제거하기 전에는 반드시 해당 케이블의 문서나 네트워크 관리자에게 확인하는 것이 가장 안전합니다. 실수가 발생하면 큰 문제를 초래할 수 있으니까요.\n케이블 성능? 색상 대신 '카테고리'에 주목하세요!  \n가장 중요한 포인트 중 하나인데요, 케이블 재킷의 색상은 해당 케이블의 실제 성능과는 전혀 무관하다는 것입니다. 이더넷 케이블은 '카테고리'로 분류되며, 각 카테고리는 특정 속도와 대역폭을 위해 설계되었어요.\n예를 들어볼까요?\nCat 5e는 최대 1Gbps의 속도를 지원하고요,\nCat 6a는 더 긴 거리에서 최대 10Gbps까지 처리할 수 있습니다.\nCat 8은 대역폭의 헤비급 선수라고 할 수 있는데, 데이터 센터용으로 제작되어 짧은 거리에서는 최대 40Gbps까지 도달할 수 있어요. 정말 엄청난 속도죠!\n그러니까, 화려한 분홍색 Cat 6 케이블이 칙칙한 회색 Cat 5e 케이블보다 훨씬 뛰어난 성능을 발휘할 수 있다는 이야기예요. 중요한 것은 케이블 옆면에 인쇄된 '카테고리 등급'이지, 겉으로 보이는 색상이 아니라는 점을 꼭 기억해주세요. 이 카테고리는 단순히 속도뿐만 아니라, 전기적 간섭으로부터 케이블을 얼마나 잘 보호하는지, 그리고 안정적이고 신뢰할 수 있는 연결을 얼마나 잘 유지하는지까지 정의한답니다.\n이 때문에 오래된 Cat 5 케이블을 Cat 6 또는 Cat 6a로 업그레이드하면 현대 네트워크 환경에서 확연한 성능 차이를 느낄 수 있어요. 제 경험상, 특히 고화질 스트리밍이나 대용량 파일 전송이 잦다면 체감 효과가 상당합니다.\n\n\n내부 전선 색상 코드는 왜 중요할까?  \n외부 재킷 색깔 이야기는 이제 충분히 한 것 같고, 그럼 이제 케이블 '내부' 전선들의 색상 코드로 넘어가 볼까요? 사실 여기가 진짜 중요합니다. 외부 색상이 그저 \"편의\"를 위한 것이었다면, 내부 전선의 색상 코드는 이더넷 케이블이 제대로 작동하기 위한 \"필수\" 요소예요.\n이 내부 전선 색상 코드는 크게 두 가지 국제 표준으로 나뉘어요: T568A와 T568B입니다. 이 두 가지 표준은 8개의 내부 전선(4쌍의 꼬임선)을 RJ45 커넥터의 핀에 어떤 순서로 연결할지를 정의합니다. 이 순서가 틀어지면 네트워크 연결이 아예 안 되거나, 불안정해지죠.\n대부분의 상업용 및 주거용 건물에서는 T568B 표준을 사용하는 경우가 많지만, 오래된 건물이나 특정 환경에서는 T568A를 쓰기도 합니다. 중요한 건, 양쪽 끝 커넥터의 배열이 같아야 스트레이트(Straight-through) 케이블이 되고, 한쪽은 T568A, 다른 한쪽은 T568B로 배열해야 크로스오버(Crossover) 케이블이 된다는 점이에요. 크로스오버 케이블은 스위치 없이 두 대의 컴퓨터를 직접 연결하는 등 특정 상황에서만 사용됩니다.\n핀 번호\nT568A 색상\nT568B 색상\n\n\n\n\n1\n흰-녹\n흰-주\n\n\n2\n녹\n주\n\n\n3\n흰-주\n흰-녹\n\n\n4\n파\n파\n\n\n5\n흰-파\n흰-파\n\n\n6\n주\n녹\n\n\n7\n흰-갈\n흰-갈\n\n\n8\n갈\n갈\n\n\n\n아, 그리고 잊지 말아야 할 게 하나 더 있어요. 내부 전선은 모두 꼬여있다는 사실입니다. 이렇게 꼬여있는 형태는 외부 간섭으로부터 신호 손실을 최소화하고 안정적인 통신을 가능하게 해요. 그래서 \"꼬임쌍선(Twisted Pair)\" 케이블이라고 불리는 거고요. 혹시 직접 이더넷 케이블을 만드실 기회가 있다면, 이 내부 색상 코드를 정말 정말 신중하게 맞춰야 합니다. 잘못 연결하면 정말 곤란해지거든요!\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 외부 색상은 성능과 무관: 이더넷 케이블의 외부 재킷 색상은 속도나 성능이 아닌, 주로 '조직화'와 '식별'을 위한 도구입니다.\n✅ 정해진 표준은 없음: 외부 색상에 대한 보편적인 국제 표준은 없으며, 사용자의 재량이나 특정 조직의 규칙에 따라 의미가 달라질 수 있습니다.\n✅ 성능은 '카테고리'가 결정: 케이블의 실제 성능(속도, 대역폭, 안정성)은 Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 8과 같은 '카테고리 등급'에 의해 결정됩니다. 구매 시 반드시 이를 확인해야 해요.\n✅ 내부 색상 코드는 필수: 케이블 내부의 꼬임쌍선 색상 코드(T568A/B)는 RJ45 커넥터 연결에 필수적이며, 네트워크 연결 안정성에 직접적인 영향을 미칩니다.\n이더넷 케이블 선택과 사용에 있어 색상이 주는 시각적 정보는 분명 도움이 되지만, 그 본질적인 역할과 성능 기준을 정확히 이해하는 것이 중요합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 이더넷 케이블 색깔이 다르면 속도도 다른가요?\nA1: 아니요, 이더넷 케이블의 외부 색상은 데이터 전송 속도나 성능과는 전혀 무관합니다. 색상은 주로 네트워크 관리의 편의를 위해 케이블의 용도를 구분하는 데 사용됩니다. 실제 속도와 성능은 'Cat(카테고리)' 등급(예: Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 8)에 따라 결정됩니다.\nQ2: T568A와 T568B는 무엇이며, 왜 중요한가요?\nA2: T568A와 T568B는 이더넷 케이블 내부 꼬임쌍선의 RJ45 커넥터 연결 배열을 정의하는 두 가지 국제 표준입니다. 이 표준에 따라 정확하게 연결해야 데이터 신호가 올바르게 전송되고 안정적인 네트워크 연결이 가능합니다. 이 배열이 잘못되면 통신이 불가능해지거나 불안정해질 수 있습니다.\nQ3: 집에서 이더넷 케이블을 고를 때 어떤 점을 봐야 하나요?\nA3: 집에서 사용할 케이블을 고를 때는 외부 색상보다는 케이블의 '카테고리' 등급을 확인하는 것이 가장 중요합니다. 연결하려는 장비와 인터넷 속도에 맞춰 적절한 카테고리(예: 기가비트 인터넷에는 Cat 5e 이상, 더 높은 성능을 원하면 Cat 6 이상)를 선택하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ4: 오래된 Cat 5 케이블을 Cat 6로 바꾸면 효과가 있을까요?\nA4: 네, 상당한 효과를 볼 수 있습니다.

AI가 저의 취향에 딱 맞는 콘텐츠만 쏙쏙 골라주니, 시간을 절약할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 매번 만족스러운 시청 경험을 할 수 있게 되는 거죠. 서비스 제공자 입장에서는 사용자가 플랫폼에 더 오래 머물고, 재결제할 확률이 높아지니 서로 윈-윈이 되는 효과라고 볼 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  AI, 생각보다 훨씬 더 우리의 삶에 스며들었네요\n스마트 비서, 챗봇, 스트리밍 추천 외에도 AI는 정말 다양한 방식으로 우리의 삶을 풍요롭게 하고 있습니다. 스마트폰 카메라의 얼굴 인식 기능, 은행 앱의 이상 금융 거래 감지, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 맞춤형 상품 추천, 심지어는 차량 내비게이션의 실시간 교통 분석까지, 우리가 인지하지 못하는 사이에도 AI는 조용히, 그러나 강력하게 작동하고 있어요.\n물론, AI 기술의 발전이 항상 장밋빛 미래만을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다. 개인 정보 보호나 데이터 오남용, 딥페이크와 같은 윤리적인 문제들은 우리가 계속해서 논의하고 해결해나가야 할 숙제임은 분명해요. 하지만 이러한 우려에도 불구하고, AI가 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 긍정적인 측면이 훨씬 더 많다는 것을 부정하기는 어렵습니다.\n솔직히 처음에는 저도 AI가 너무 어렵고, '거대한 기술'이라고만 생각했어요. 하지만 이렇게 매일매일 사용하는 기술들을 되짚어보니, AI는 우리의 삶을 '더 쉽게' 만들어주는 '친근한 도구'라는 사실을 깨달았습니다. 미래의 AI는 또 어떤 모습으로 우리를 놀라게 할지, 정말 기대되지 않나요?\n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI는 스마트 비서처럼 이미 우리 일상에 깊이 스며들어 있습니다.\n✅ 챗봇은 정보 탐색을 넘어 창의적인 아이디어와 시각적 자료까지 제공합니다.\n✅ 스트리밍 서비스 추천은 AI가 우리의 취향을 섬세하게 분석한 결과입니다.\n✅ AI는 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 '친근한 도구'입니다.\nAI는 우리의 생각보다 훨씬 가까이에 있습니다. 조금만 관심을 가지면 AI의 놀라운 잠재력을 더욱 효과적으로 활용할 수 있을 거예요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\nA1: 네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\nQ2: AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\nA2: 개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\nQ3: 미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\nA3: 2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "창업가나 투자자라면 ‘피칭’이라는 말이 너무나 익숙할 것이다. 창업가라면 투자받기 위해서 VC들을 대상으로 셀 수 없을 정도로 사업에 관해서 설명하는 피칭을 했을 것이다. 우리도 작년에 수백 개의 피칭을 듣고 봤다. 그런데 우리 같은 VC도 투자하기 위해서는 남의 투자를 받아야 해서 우리도 펀드레이징을 하고, 꽤 많은 피칭을 한다. 우리는 작년 9월에 새로운 펀드를 만들었는데, 나중에 통계를 내보니까 이 펀드를 만들기 위해서 180명이 넘는 투자자를(=LP) 대상으로 피칭했다. 어떤 분들은 그냥 줌으로 한 번 온라인 미팅만 했지만, 어떤 해외 투자자는 10번 이상 대면 미팅한 경우도 있었다.\n물론, 이들이 스트롱에게 모두 다 돈을 준 건 아니다. 이 중 일부만 우리에게 출자했고, 대부분의 미팅을 전쟁에 임하는 태도로 열심히, 에너지 넘치게, 그리고 기세 넘치게 진행했기 때문에, 특히나 우리에게 자금을 출자한 분들과의 미팅은 아직도 머릿속에 생생하게 기억한다. 이 중 기억에 남는 미팅이 하나 있는데, 당시의 상황을 간략하게 설명하면, 펀드를 마무리해야 하는 데드라인이 몇 주 안 남았었고, 이 투자자의 돈은 꼭 받아야만 하는 상황이었다. 그런데 실은, 이미 이 투자자에게 과거에 두 번 피칭했다 두 번 모두 거절당했기 때문에, 세 번째 시도는(=삼수) 마지막 기회였다. 절박함에 대해서 우리는 자주 이야기하는데, 당시 내 심정은 절박함 그 자체였고, 정말로 비장한 각오로 줌 피칭 미팅을 시작했다.\n피칭하기 바로 전날 밤으로 상황을 리와인드 해보자. 실은 발표해야 하는 내용은 내가 14년 동안 직접 해왔던 거라서 아주 익숙했지만, 그래도 나는 전날 밤에 10번 연달아서 리허설을 했다. 약 20분 정도의 발표이니 거의 세 시간을 같은 내용을 미친 사람처럼 달달 다시 연습했던 것이다. 줌으로 파워포인트 발표를 해본 분들은 잘 아시겠지만, 화면 공유할 때 파워포인트의 포인터/펜 기능이 가끔 충돌을 일으킬 때가 있고, 강조해야 할 부분을 빨간펜으로 체크하면서 발표하다 보면 그다음 슬라이드로 넘어가지 않는 알려진 문제점도 있다. 나는 발표의 흐름을 끊을 수 있는 이런 문제점들을 사전에 모두 방지하기 위해서, 그 전날 10번 리허설을 상대편에는 아무도 없지만, 실제로 줌을 켜고 라이브로 연습했다. 그리고 연습하면서 파워포인트의 포인터 -> 펜 -> 줌의 화면 공유 상에서의 페이지 넘기기, 이 전환이 매끄럽게 될 수 있게 충분히 연습했다.\n다시 실제 피칭하는 순간으로 패스트포워드 해보자. 전날 연습을 충분히 했기 때문에 나는 자신감이 넘쳤고, 이번에도 돈을 못 받는 건 고려 대상이 아니라는 벼랑 끝에 선 각오로 엄청나게 기세 있게 발표했다. 온라인이고 작은 노트북 화면에서 발표하는 거지만, 반대편에 보이는 약 10명의 청중의 눈을 하나씩 맞추려고 노력했고, 엄청난 기세를 이들에게 100% 전달하겠다는 각오로 거의 샤우팅 하듯이 피칭했다. 그리고 이분들에게 우리는 돈을 받았다는 해피엔딩으로 이 피칭 이야기는 끝난다.\n나중에, 이 LP들에게 들었다. 화면으로만 나를 보고 들었지만, 정말로 스트롱이 돈을 꼭 받아야겠다는 독기를 품었다는 각오가 강하게 느껴졌고, 정말 그 엄청난 기세가 줌 화면을 통해서도 생생하게 온몸으로 전달됐다고.\n“인생은 기세다.”라는 말을 우리는 자주 한다. 밑바닥에서 시작해서 성공한 연예인들이 이 말을 하는 것을 나는 자주 들었다. 그런데 나도 좀 살아보고, 일도 좀 해보고, 투자도 좀 해보니 정말로 이 기세가 중요하다는 걸 느끼고 있다. 창업도 기세, 펀드레이징도 기세, 글로벌 진출도 기세, 심지어 우리 같은 VC가 하는 벤처 투자도 기세다. 이 모든 게 안 될 이유가 백만 가지가 있는, 했다 하면 실패할 게 거의 뻔한 일들이다. 그 와중에 되게 만들어야 하고, 되게 할 이유를 찾아야 하는데, 이건 자신감과 기세가 없으면 매우 힘든 일이다. 우리 주변에 불가능을 가능케 하는 사람들을 보면, 가끔 나는 이들이 짐승 같다고 생각한다. 그만큼 본인들이 목표하는 걸 무조건 해야겠다는 의지와 이를 막는 사람들은 모두 다 짐승같이 씹어 먹어버리겠다는 기세가 보이기 때문이다.\n기세는 실제로 그 일을 하는 사람에게 발동을 걸고, 누가 봐도 안 될 일을 계속 시도하게 만드는 희망과 에너지의 원동력이다. 하지만, 기세는 그 일을 하는 사람의 힘든 여정을 같이 하는 주변 사람들에게도 전류와 같이 흐르면서 안 될 일을 되게 만드는 방향으로 기운을 흐르게 만들 수도 있다고 생각한다. 내가 피칭할 때 내 기세가 분명히 발표를 듣는 분들에게도 전달됐고, 이들의 결정에 긍정적인 영향을 미쳤다고 나는 믿는다.\n그럼, 이 기세는 어디서 나오는 건가? 내 경험에 의하면 기세는 누구나 다 후천적으로 습득할 수 있는 기술이자 자산이다. 기세는 자신감에서 나온다. 그럼, 자신감은 어디서 나오나? 결국엔 수년, 수십 년 동안 반복하는 좋은 습관과 연습에서 나온다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "본인이 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피이거나, 또는 주변에 이렇게 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피 친구와 지인이 항상 몇 명씩 누구나 있을 것이다. 철면피는 말 그대로 얼굴이 두꺼워서 남의 비판을 신경 쓰지 않는 뻔뻔한 사람을 뜻하는데, ‘얼굴에 철판을 깔았다’라는 말도 우리는 자주 사용한다. 이 말은 어떻게, 언제 쓰이냐에 따라 긍정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있고, 부정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있는데, 오늘은 아주 긍정적인 의미에서의 철면피에 대해서 이야기해 보려고 한다.\n얼마 전에 미국의 슈퍼 어디에서나 볼 수 있는 저당 간식 스키니딥드(SkinnyDipped)의 창업 이야기를 팟캐스트로 들었다. 초코 코팅 아몬드인데, 주로 다크초콜릿을 사용하고 코팅을 아주 얇게 해서 다른 간식보다 당과 열량이 낮은 제품인데, 모든 창업 이야기가 웬만한 TV 드라마보다 드라마틱하듯이, 이 회사의 이야기도 너무 재미있었다. 이 회사의 창업 초기에는 내가 다른 스타트업의 창업 초기에서도 항상 발견하는 공통점이 있었는데, 바로 창업가들의 철면피와 뻔뻔스러움이다. 엄마와 딸이 창업한 회사인데 제품을 오프라인 유통업체에 입점시키기 위해서 초반에는 두 분이 별의별 짓을 다 했다. 일단 Whole Foods 입점을 위해 간식 담당자를 만나기 위해서 매일 매장에서 하염없이 기다린 이야기도 있고(우리가 투자한 회사의 대표도 실제로 이렇게 한 적이 있는데, 이건 요새도 잘 먹히는 방법이다.), 더 재미있었던 에피소드는 회사의 본사가 있던 시애틀의 구글 건물에 몰래 들어가서, 구내식당에서 어슬렁거리면서 쉐프를 찾았고, 스키니딥드 제품을 구글 직원들에게 간식으로 제공해야 한다고 설득한 이야기다.\n이런 두꺼운 낯짝으로 고객사, 투자사, 협력사에 쳐들어가는 건 내가 아는 매우 많은 창업가가 창업 초기에 했던할 수밖에 없었던 공통된 필수 코스인데, 실제로 사업을 하다 보면 누구나 다 이렇게 해야 하는 시점이 있다. 그리고 정말 성공하고 싶다면 모든 창업가들이 이렇게 철면피를 깔고, 일반인들은 쪽팔려서 절대로 하지 못하는, 그런 일들을 해야 한다.\n나도 오래전에 영업하면서 철면피 영업을 했었고, 뮤직쉐이크를 하면서도 여러 번 이런 경험이 있고, 스트롱을 처음 시작할 때도 그냥 여기저기 쳐들어가서 달성하고자 하는 일을 시도해 본 적이 있다. 모든 쳐들어감이 성공하진 못했고, 어떤 경우에는 철면피가 찢어지기도 했지만, 어쨌든 나는 정말 간절했고, 그 간절함이 당시에 이런 두꺼운 낯짝을 형성해 준 것 같다.\n나도 이런 경험을 직접 해봤기 때문에 우리 투자사 대표님들에게도 가끔 이렇게 해야 한다고 하는데, 많은 분들이 “저는 그런 거 원래 못해요” , “뭐, 그렇게까지 해야 하나요?”라는 말을 한다. 나는 “네, 그렇게까지 해야 합니다.”라고 하지만, 실제로 철면피를 깔고 행동할 수 있는 분들은 그렇게 많지 않다.\n그런데 이분들이 잘 모르는 사실이 하나 있다. 위에서 말한 스키니딥드 창업가나 과거의 나 같은 사람도 태어날 때부터 쪽팔림을 모르고, 남의 시선을 신경 쓰지 않고, 철면피였던 건 아니다. 이들도 당연히 안 만나주려고 하는 사람들의 사무실에 불쑥 쳐들어가거나, 누가 건물의 출입구를 열어주기를 하염없이 추위에서 기다리거나, 안 사겠다고 하는 잠재 고객사 대표의 새벽 출근길 자가용의 문을 기사님 대신 매일 열어주고 인사하는 짓을 너무너무 즐겁고 기쁘게 하진 않을 것이다. 이들에게도 아주 창피하고, 자존심 상하고, 하기 싫은 일이지만, 해야 하니까 하는 것이다.\n모든 창업가에겐 어느 정도의 철면피가 꼭 필요하다고 나는 생각한다. 이들이 회사를 처음 창업하고, 회사가 어느 정도 궤도에 올라가기 전까지는 대부분 투자자들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 협력업체들이 협업하고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 좋은 잠재 임직원분들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람인데, 나를 만나기 싫거나 나에게 관심이 없는 사람과 만나서 이야기할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 그냥 얼굴에 철판 깔고 쳐들어가는 것이다. 아주 힘들고, 아주 쪽팔리고, 아주 자존심 상하고, 굳이 이렇게까지 해야 하나 생각이 드는, 그런 행동이지만, 사업을 하기 위해서는 필요한 일이다. 왜냐하면, 이렇게 무리수를 둬서 일단 만나면 그 이후에 안 될 일도 되는 것을 나는 직접 경험해봤고, 여러 번 옆에서 목격했기 때문이다.\n다시 한번 강조한다. 그 누구도 철면피를 갖고 태어나진 않았다. 꼭 필요하고, 꼭 해야 하니까 낯짝을 두껍게 만든 것이다.",
