        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are pleased to announce AddressSanitizer (ASan) support for the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools for ARM64 targets. ASan is a runtime memory error detector that identifies difficult-to-find bugs with zero false positives and improves memory safety. More technical information on ASan can be found at aka.ms/asan. \nASan has long supported the x64 and x86 architectures. With the release of Visual Studio 2026 for production use, this support now extends to ARM64. The feature is currently in preview, so there may be build, runtime, or IDE integration issues. Cross-compiling for ARM64 targets from x86 or x64 hosts is supported. ARM64EC is not supported. \nTo use ASan in Visual Studio 2026: \nFrom the Visual Studio Installer: \nSelect MSVC AddressSanitizer under Desktop development with C++ \nTo support cross-compiling projects to ARM64, install MSVC Build Tools for ARM64/ARM64EC  \nTo enable ASan in your C++ project after installation: \nRight click the solution  \nClick Properties  \nClick C/C++ \nEnable AddressSanitizer > Yes (/fsanitize=address)\n \nA preview message will display when targeting ARM64 with ASan: \nARM64 support for MSVC AddressSanitizer is provided as a preview. \nWe’re eager to hear about bugs and suggestions for improvements. \nHowever, note that this feature is provided as-is without support as we’re working towards the full implementation. \nSee: https://aka.ms/asan \nBy default, the VCASan library is also used to improve the debugging experience inside Visual Studio. \nIf you’ve built your application on a host architecture other than ARM64, it must be executed on an ARM64 target machine from an ARM64 Visual Studio 2026 Developer Command Prompt or alongside the ASan binary clang_rt.asan_dynamic-aarch64.dll. Otherwise, the ASan binary must be manually copied from %VSINSTALLDIR%\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\<version>\\bin\\Hostarm64\\arm64 to the same directory of the executable under test. \nWe’d love for you to try it out and provide any feedback you may have! Please report any issues you find via Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem in Visual Studio.\nThe post Introducing MSVC AddressSanitizer for ARM64 targets appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

However, with GitHub Copilot agents, developers can now delegate these complex editing tasks to the agent, which understands your intent and can carry out codebase-wide edits, reducing the manual effort required to perform these refactors.\nTo make this experience even more powerful for C++ developers, we’re introducing C++ Code Editing Tools for GitHub Copilot, now available in Private Preview in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nThese tools bring the power of C++ IntelliSense to Visual Studio agent mode, enabling faster and more accurate codebase-wide edits. With these tools, GitHub Copilot can now access rich context for any C++ symbol, including:\nViewing all references across your codebase\nUnderstanding relevant metadata (e.g. type, declaration, and scope)\nVisualizing class inheritance hierarchies\nTracing function call chains\n\nBy grounding edits in semantic understanding rather than syntactic-level text matching, these tools help reduce the manual effort required for refactors.\n\nTo see these tools in action, please watch our demo below\n\nYou can invoke these tools directly in Copilot Chat and use prompt files for more complex refactoring tasks. For best results, we recommend that you be clear and specific with your prompts and break larger ideas into smaller, fine-grained tasks for the agent to execute.\nWant to try it out?\nThese tools are now available in Private Preview as we work to shape the user experience and gather feedback from our C++ developers.

For the most part, those problems have nothing to do with the language and how it is used, but instead all the “other” stuff, like dealing with long build times, getting consistent build environments, and managing the technical debt of an evolving tooling landscape.\nWhen the tools we use to build our applications and systems have new releases, we must make hard decisions. Do we adopt the latest and greatest and turn potential technical debt into realized technical debt, or do we err on the side of the stability of our systems, perhaps at the cost of critical performance or security improvements? A reasonable approach is to weigh the benefits we will gain against the costs of dealing with different codegen, stricter language conformance, and deprecated or removed features.\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++, available in Private Preview in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, tips the scale, greatly reducing the toil incurred when adopting newer versions of MSVC. Let GitHub Copilot churn through that technical debt while you focus on adding that great new feature or finding and resolving the root cause of that bug found by your most important customer.\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ can launch the upgrade process, analyze the project for any warnings or errors, create a detailed plan on how to fix those issues, and then implement those changes. Along the way, you’ll have the opportunity to direct Copilot to focus on specific issues and to adjust the plan to fit your exact situation and coding practices. You won’t need to spend hours or days tracking down all the places where that deprecated API is used and manually applying the same pattern to adopt its replacement. And you won’t need to stare at your screen trying to decide which of the hundreds of new warnings should be the first that you should tackle; Copilot may even resolve them all before you’ve had time to understand the work and decide where to start.\nWant to try it out?\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is now available in Private Preview so that we can gather feedback from users with real world C++ codebases. If you want to help others, including your future self, by helping us make the experience as awesome as possible, please join our Private Preview waitlist. And in the meantime, go ahead and get started with the latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders build!\n \nThe post Fix build issues using GitHub Copilot after upgrading MSVC Build Tools appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Get ready to level up your C++ productivity, because Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 is now generally available! You can take advantage of the new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements in your production environment. This post describes what’s new for C++ developers, including new features or improvements in these areas:\nA refreshed IDE UI\nSupport for Visual Studio 2022 extensions out of the box\nSeamless upgrade experience from an older version of Visual Studio\nMicrosoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50: Greater C++23 conformance and runtime performance improvements\nAddressSanitizer support for ARM64 targets (Preview)\nIDE productivity improvements:\n\nNew keyboard shortcuts\nSyntax highlighting for C++ attributes\nClass View substring searches and performance improvements\nGenerate preprocessed output\nEnhanced controls in the bottom margin, including viewing and setting file encoding\nFile exclusion options in Quick Find and Find in Files\nGitHub Copilot Chat: improved chat experience and new context menu options\nC++ project system changes (MSBuild and CMake)\nNew clang-tidy configuration options\nSet command line arguments for the debugger from the toolbar\nMermaid chart rendering\nPodman support in Container Tools\nGit tools improvements\nYou can also read the broader announcement on the Visual Studio Blog for more details on changes that are non-C++-specific. Let’s dive in!\nYour feedback matters to us\nYou can always give us feedback about your Visual Studio experience on Visual Studio Developer Community or from the Help > Send Feedback menu in the IDE.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we fixed 387 C++ related issues and implemented 29 C++ related feature requests in Visual Studio. Many of the new features described in this blog post were suggested by you!\nRefreshed UI with 11 themes to choose from\nUser Feedback: Update UI of Visual Studio 2022 like the new Windows 11 UI – Developer Community\nThe new IDE includes a UI refresh, from icon and spacing changes to 11 new themes.\n\nImproved settings UI\nUser Feedback: Unified Settings feedback – Developer Community\nThe Visual Studio settings (Tools > Options) UI is now integrated into the editor. You can also configure the settings from a JSON file accessible from the new UI.\n\nYour settings will carry forward from older Visual Studio versions with roaming support. However, settings will no longer sync back to older products to ensure a cleaner migration path and forward compatibility.\nBring your Visual Studio 2022 extensions\n\nVisual Studio 2026 works out of the box with your existing Visual Studio 2022 extensions.\nUpgrading existing projects to Visual Studio 2026\nCheck out our blog post, Upgrading C++ Projects to Visual Studio 2026, for an overview of what’s available to you to help you manage your transition to Visual Studio 2026, including continued binary compatibility for the C++ build tools and redistributable and the new Visual Studio setup assistant. Then, take a look at our updated porting and upgrading guide in our documentation.\nMicrosoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50\nVersion 18.0 of the IDE ships with Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools version 14.50, offering our best conformance, build performance, and runtime performance story yet, along with a multitude of bug fixes. To get access to all the new language features, be sure to build with /std:c++latest or go with /std:c++23preview if you only need features up to and including C++23.\nC++ language improvements in the compiler\nC++23 language updates in the compiler are summarized in the C++ Language Updates in MSVC Build Tools v14.50 blog post. They include, but are not limited to:\nP0849R8: auto(x): decay-copy in the language, for casting x into a prvalue as if passing it as a function argument by value.\nP2437R1: Implemented C++23 preprocessing directive #warning to allow code authors to generate a diagnostic message without stopping translation the way #error does.\nCWG Issue 2586: Explicit object parameter for assignment and comparison.\nP2280R4: Using unknown pointers and references in constant expressions.\nC++ language features and performance improvements in the standard library\nMicrosoft C++ standard library (STL) changes are summarized at: Changelog · microsoft/STL Wiki. As this is an open-source project, we welcome community contributions. With the help of the community, we implemented many improvements, including, but not limited to:\nP0472R3: Put monostate in <utility>.\nP3223R2: Making std::istream::ignore(n, delim) less surprising. This had surprising behavior if delim is a char with a negative value. This change removes the surprise to make code more robust.\nPartial support for P3697R1: minor additions to standard library hardening to improve memory safety.\nLWG-2503: multiline option should be added to syntax_option_type.\nLWG-4186: regex_traits::transform_primary mistakenly detects typeid of a function.\nLWG-4222: expected constructor from a single value missing a constraint.\nLWG-4242: ranges::distance does not work with volatile iterators.\nA multitude of performance improvements (see changelog for more):\n\nImproved performance for regex matching.\nStarted using [[msvc::no_unique_address]] as a space optimization in several C++23 components.\nAdded and improved vectorized implementations of many types and functions.\nUsed Clang’s builtin __is_trivially_equality_comparable to improve the performance of equal(), ranges::equal, and many vectorized algorithms for more types.\nImplemented an exponential speedup for minstd_rand and minstd_rand0's discard() member function\nImproved std::includes() to have the same performance as ranges::includes\nImproved the performance of count() for vector<bool>\nCompiler runtime performance improvements\nWorking closely with our game developer partners, we invested in runtime performance improvements for code built with MSVC. We measured these improvements using benchmarks from Unreal Engine City Sample (RenderThread and GameThread):\nUp to +6% faster runtime, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3% faster runtime, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nAddressSanitizer support for ARM64 builds (Preview)\nIn Visual Studio 2019 we added AddressSanitizer support for code built with MSVC to help developers identify memory safety issues with zero false positives using the /fsanitize=address flag. At the time, the support applied to code built for x86 and x64 architectures. This support is now extended to projects targeting ARM64. This ARM64 support is in preview, and we will continue to refine it and fix any incoming bugs in future updates.\nIDE productivity improvements\nWe worked on several developer productivity improvements in 18.0, many in response to feedback from you!\nMore keyboard shortcut consistency with other editors\nUser Feedback: Adding a shortcut Ctrl+W to close the file in VS – Developer Community\nSeveral keyboard shortcuts have been added from VS Code and other editors to give you a more consistent experience as you switch between these environments. In the past, this included Ctrl + / to toggle line comments and Ctrl + Shift + P to open Feature Search. But the following shortcuts are new in 18.0:\nCtrl + W now closes the current tab (in addition to Ctrl + F4)\nCtrl + P now opens Code Search (in addition to Ctrl + T and Ctrl + ,)\nSyntax highlighting for C++ attributes\nUser Feedback: Syntax highlighting: use a unique color for C++ attributes – Developer Community\nC++ attributes are now colored in the editor, making your code more visually distinctive and easier to read. By default, they use the same theme color as user-defined types.\n\nClass View substring searches and performance improvements\nUser Feedback: Search in Class View does not work, if search term is not the beginning of the class but part of it – Developer Community\nThe Class View window now supports substring searches, so you can have an easier time examining the architecture of your code.\n\nIn addition, Class View’s performance has been improved for Unreal Engine projects.\nGenerate preprocessed output\nUser Feedback: Make it possible to see preprocessed C++ source code (easily in IDE) – Developer Community\nYou can right-click a C++ file in Solution Explorer and select Preprocess to instantly generate its preprocessed output, making it easy to debug macros and includes, see errors immediately, and avoid manual changes to project settings or interruptions to full project builds.\n\nEnhanced controls in the bottom margin\nUser Feedback: I wish Visual Studio 2022 able to show file encoding in the editor. – Developer Community\nThe bottom margin in the editor has been upgraded to be more informative and customizable. Line, column, and character position are now unified into a single display. Clicking it opens the Go To Line dialog for faster navigation. When working with multiple selections, you’ll see total counts for selections, characters, and lines. Hovering over the selection margin reveals detailed info per selection.\n\nFile encoding is now displayed in the margin for quick reference. You can also save or reopen a file using a specific encoding, which helps ensure proper display of special characters, supports multiple languages, and maintains consistent readability across systems.\nClicking the encoding margin opens a context menu where you can choose to save or reopen the file. Selecting an option will launch an encoding dialog with a dropdown list of available encodings to choose from.\n\nA new context menu has been added to the margin, giving you full control over what information is shown. This menu includes all the bottom margins in the editor, from the zoom control all the way to the new encoding margin.\n\nYou can manage these settings through Tools > Options > Text Editor > General > Display > Show editing context in the editor. For quicker adjustments, right-click the bottom margin to open the new context menu and change what’s shown.\nFile exclusions in Find in Files / Quick Find\nUser Feedback: Find and Replace — option to exclude folders – Developer Community\nYou can now exclude files you never need to look at from Find in Files (Ctrl + Shift + F) and Quick Find (Ctrl + F). To set it up, go to Tools > Options > Environment > Search, and look for the new Exclude files from search results section. There, you can add, edit, or remove glob patterns to control exactly which files are left out of your search results.\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat\nGitHub Copilot Chat allows you to use natural language to get answers to questions (Ask mode) or even implement changes for you automatically (Agent Mode). We made several improvements to this feature (listed below), and we also have 3 new features available in Private Preview: New GitHub Copilot capabilities for C++ developers: Upgrade MSVC, improve build performance, and refactor C++ code.\nBetter responses in Copilot Chat\nUser Feedback: Visual Studio GitHub Copilot line number difference – Developer Community\nCopilot Chat is getting smarter with improved context for your everyday tasks. You can expect better results when searching your codebase and referencing specific lines in your code.\nCopilot Actions in context menu\nUser Feedback: Quickly Get Copilot Assistance from Your Context Menu – Developer Community\nA Copilot Actions option was added to the right-click context menu in the Visual Studio editor.\n\nYou can use this to interact with a specific file or lines of code in Copilot Chat. You can ask Copilot to explain what the code does, make optimizations, generate comments or unit tests, or just reference it in the chat for you to add your own custom prompt.\nReference commits and changes in the Git Changes window\nYou can now ask Copilot to summarize uncommitted code changes, explain a specific commit, and more.\n\nYou can reference uncommitted changes by adding #changes to your prompt or type #commit: to pull up a list of the most recent commits for you to select. You can also reference a specific commit id.\n\nWith the context of your changes or commits, you can then ask Copilot to answer questions in Ask Mode or perform tasks in Agent Mode like writing unit tests or finding bugs.\nReference URLs in your questions\nYou can paste a URL in the prompt box and Copilot will pull information from the web to prepare its response. For example, you can ask Copilot to write a readme file based on best practices from GitHub or to look at reference material while preparing an answer to a question.\n\nThis only works for public URLs and static HTML content.\nC++ Project Systems\nVisual Studio 2026 continues to maintain native support for MSBuild, CMake, and Unreal Engine projects.\nC++20 default for new MSBuild projects\nMany MSBuild projects generated using new project templates now target C++20 by default. This includes the Console App, Windows Desktop Application, Dynamic-Link Library, and Static Library.\nCMake projects in Visual Studio 2026\nVisual Studio 2026 now includes CMake 4.1.1 by default. CMake also includes a Visual Studio 2026 generator and modern SLNX projects, allowing you to build Visual Studio C++ projects directly from CMake.\nDiagnostic Tools now support CMake projects\nCMake projects now have native support for profiling tools including CPU Usage, Events Viewer, memory usage, and File IO tools in Visual Studio.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how we’ve enabled Dolby Vision and ambient viewing environment (amve) on the Instagram iOS app to enhance the video viewing experience.\nHDR videos created on iPhones contain unique Dolby Vision and amve metadata that we needed to support end-to-end\nInstagram for iOS is now the first Meta app to support Dolby Vision video, with more support coming across all of Meta’s apps coming in the future.\nEvery iPhone-produced HDR video encoding includes two additional pieces of metadata that help ensure the picture is consistent between different displays and viewing conditions:\nAmbient viewing environment (amve), which provides the characteristics of the nominal ambient viewing environment for displaying associated video content. This information enables the final device to adjust the rendering of the video if the actual ambient viewing conditions differ from those for which it was encoded.\nDolby Vision, which enhances color, brightness, and contrast to better match the video to the capabilities of the display.\nWhile the Instagram and Facebook iOS apps have supported high dynamic range (HDR) video since 2022, our initial rollout of HDR didn’t support Dolby Vision or amve delivery and playback. Our derived encodings were done with FFmpeg, which has traditionally lacked support for Dolby Vision and amve. Since our tooling was discarding this metadata, it meant that pictures were not entirely representative of the way they were meant to be viewed – something that was particularly noticeable at low screen brightness levels.\nNow, after hearing feedback from people using our iOS apps, we’ve worked with our partners to preserve the iOS-produced amve and Dolby Vision metadata from end-to-end and significantly enhanced the HDR viewing experience on iOS devices.  \nHow Meta Processes Video \nIt may first be helpful to give some background on the lifecycle of a video at Meta. \nThe majority of videos uploaded through our apps go through three main stages:\n1. Client Processing \nIn the client processing stage, the creator’s device flattens their composition into a single video file at a size appropriate for upload. For HDR videos produced by iOS devices this means encoding with HEVC using the Main 10 profile. This is the stage in which amve and Dolby Vision metadata are produced, added to the encoded bitstream, and uploaded to Meta’s servers.\n2.  Server Processing\nIn the server processing stage, our transcoding system generates different versions of the video for different consumers. As playback occurs across a variety of devices with different capabilities, we need to produce the video in a format which will be optimal for each device. In the scope of HDR uploads, this means producing an SDR version for devices that don’t support HDR, a VP9 version to satisfy the majority of players, and (for our most popular videos) an AV1 version with the highest quality at the lowest file size.\nEach of these versions is produced at a different bitrate (essentially, file size) to ensure that consumers with varying network conditions are all able to play the video without waiting for a large download to complete (the tradeoff is that lower bitrates have lower quality). All of our derived encodings are created with FFmpeg, which historically lacked support for amve and Dolby Vision. This is the stage where metadata was getting dropped.\n3. Consumption\nIn the consumption stage, the viewer’s device picks the version that will play back smoothly (without stalls), decodes it frame by frame, and draws each frame onto the screen. In the context of iOS, all HDR playback is done using Apple’s AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer (AVSBDL). This is the class that consumes amve and Dolby Vision metadata along with each decoded frame.\nHow We Added Support for amve\nWhen we first set off to support amve in 2022, we noticed something interesting. As we operate on a decoupled architecture of lower-level components rather than a typical high-level AVPlayer setup, we were able to inspect an intact video encoding and get a look at the amve metadata in between the decoder and AVSBDL. We observed that every frame of every video seemed to have exactly the same metadata. This allowed us to hold ourselves over with a quick fix and hardcode these values directly into our player pipeline.\nThis was not a great situation to be in. Even though the value seemed to be static, there was nothing enforcing this. Maybe a new iPhone or iOS version would produce different values, then we’d be using the wrong ones. amve is also not a concept on Android, which would mean that viewing an Android-produced HDR encoding on iPhone would result in an image that was not technically accurate.\nIn 2024, we worked with the community to land amve support in FFmpeg. We also built in some logging, which showed that our two-year-old assertion that the values never change still stood. But if they ever do, we will be properly set up for it. \nEnabling Dolby Vision\nDolby Vision was not as straightforward as amve to adopt.\nChallenge #1: The extant specification was for carriage of metadata within an HEVC bitstream. We don’t deliver HEVC.\niPhone-produced HDR uses Dolby Vision profile 8.4, where 8 indicates a profile using HEVC (the video codec) and .4 means cross-compatible with HLG (the standard for HDR video that players without Dolby Vision support would adhere to). \nIn order to deliver Dolby Vision metadata we needed to carry it within a codec that we do deliver. Fortunately, Dolby has created Profile 10 for carriage of Dolby Vision within AV1. As VP9 does not offer a facility for carriage of additional metadata there is no support for Dolby Vision at this time, but we are interested in exploring alternate delivery mechanisms.\nHowever, Dolby Vision Profiles 10 and 8 were not properly supported by our existing video processing tools, including FFmpeg and Shaka packager. Based on the specifications from Dolby, we collaborated with the FFmpeg developers to fully implement support for Dolby Vision Profile 8 and Profile 10. In particular, we enabled support within FFmpeg to transcode HEVC with Profile 8.4 into AV1 with Profile 10.4 using both the libaom and libsvtav1 encoders, and made fixes to other parts of the stack, including dav1d decoder and Shaka packager, to properly support Dolby Vision metadata.\nChallenge #2: Getting Dolby Vision into AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer\nWhen you feed AVSBDL an encoded bitstream in a supported format, e.g., HEVC from an iPhone camera, Dolby Vision just works for free. But we feed buffers that we decode independently, as we need to be able to decode formats that Apple does not offer out of the box (AV1 on devices before the iPhone 15 Pro, for example). Given this setup, it’s only fair that we’d have to extract Dolby Vision independently as well.\nFollowing the newly-minted specification for carriage of Profile 10 within an AV1 bitstream from Dolby, we implemented manual extraction of Dolby Vision metadata, packaged it into the same format that AVSBDL expected, and we were in business.\nTo prove that our setup was working as expected, we set up a series of identical Instagram posts with and without Dolby Vision metadata. Our partners at Dolby measured the brightness of each of these posts using a display color analyzer, at varying levels of screen brightness.\nThey captured the following:\nScreen brightness settings versus image brightness, with and without Dolby Vision.\nIn this chart, the X-axis represents the screen brightness setting and the Y-axis represents the observed image brightness. The results demonstrate that with Dolby Vision metadata present, the brightness of the content much more closely follows the brightness setting of the screen.\nIt worked!…But we were not done yet. \nTesting Our Dolby Vision Implementation\nAt Meta, we A/B test new features before shipping them to ensure they are performing as we expect. How do we A/B test metadata embedded within a video bitstream? The answer is that we produced an additional version of every video containing the new metadata. We delivered this new version to a randomly distributed test population while the randomly distributed control population continued receiving the existing experience. At our scale, we can assert that roughly an equal population will watch both flavors of each video.\nFor each flavor, we collected statistics such as how long the video was watched, how long it took to load, what type of connection it was watched on, and whether any errors were encountered during playback. Then we analyzed in aggregate to see how the flavor with metadata compared to the flavor without.\nWe hypothesized that if the metadata works as expected, videos with the new metadata would receive more watch time. But when we ran our initial test on Instagram Reels in 2024 we found that, on average, videos with Dolby Vision metadata were actually watched less than their standard counterparts.\nHow could this be possible? Isn’t Dolby Vision supposed to improve the image?\nOur First A/B Test With Dolby Vision Metadata \nOur data indicated that people were watching less Dolby Vision video because the videos were taking too long to load and people were just moving on to the next Reel in their feed.\nThere was a reasonable cause for the longer load times: The new metadata added on the order of 100 kbps to every video on average. It sounds petty, but our encodings are highly optimized for all kinds of diverse viewing conditions. Every bit counts in some situations, and a 100-kbps overhead was enough to regress engagement at the margins.\nThe answer to this was a compressed metadata format. The team at Dolby offered another specification which would lower the metadata overhead by a factor of four, to 25 kbps on average.\nWould it be enough? We had to run another test to find out. But there was more work to be done first.\nWe needed to implement support for Dolby Vision metadata compression (and decompression while we’re at it) in FFmpeg using a bitstream filter. Also, while the uncompressed format was something we could extract from the bitstream and hand off to Apple, the compressed format was not something that was supported by Apple out of the box. We had to implement client-side decompression on our own.\nAbout 2000 lines of code later, we were ready.\nOur Successful A/B Test \nThis time, we found that consumers viewing with Dolby Vision metadata were spending more time in the app. We attribute this to people spending more time watching HDR videos in lower-light environments, when their screens are set to lower brightness levels and the HDR videos with proper metadata are less taxing on the eyes.\nBecause including Dolby Vision metadata had a tangibly positive outcome, we were able to make the case for shipping it across Instagram for iOS, making it our first app to take advantage of Dolby Vision. As of June 2025, all of our delivered AV1 encodings derived from iPhone-produced HDR include Dolby Vision metadata.\nThe Future of Dolby Vision Across Meta\nThe final challenge in the scope of this post is that Dolby Vision is not widely supported within the web ecosystem across different browsers and displays. Thus, we cannot accurately show the difference that it makes on this page, and hope you will experience it on Instagram on iPhone for yourself. The support for Dolby vision and amve is now in our encoding recipes and as such it’s ready for deployment to other platforms as well as we’re currently working on extending the support to Facebook Reels.\nIn collaboration with Dolby, we’ve solved the perceptible problem of HDR metadata preservation and collaborated with the FFmpeg developers to implement its support and make it readily available to the  community to take advantage of.\nThis is just the beginning. We look forward to expanding Dolby Vision to other Meta apps and their corresponding operating systems.\nAcknowledgements\nWe’d like to thank Haixia Shi, the team at Dolby, and Niklas Haas from FFmpeg for their work supporting this effort.\nThe post Enhancing HDR on Instagram for iOS With Dolby Vision appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "link": "https://engineering.fb.com/2025/11/11/web/stylex-a-styling-library-for-css-at-scale/",
        "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 17:58:20 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "StyleX is Meta’s styling system for large-scale applications. It combines the ergonomics of CSS-in-JS with the performance of static CSS, generating collision-free atomic CSS while allowing for expressive, type-safe style authoring. StyleX was open sourced at the end of 2023 and has since become the standard styling system across Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, as well as external companies like Figma and Snowflake.\nAt its core, StyleX is a compiler that extracts styles at build time and generates a static stylesheet. But it’s also a philosophy: a framework for authoring, sharing, and maintaining CSS at scale. StyleX makes styling intuitive for everyday engineers by imposing constraints that encourage predictability, enable composition, and scale effortlessly across teams and codebases.\nHow Do We Build CSS at Scale?\nTo understand the purpose of StyleX, let’s look at the history of CSS at Meta. Serving CSS at such a scale resulted in collisions across bundles, difficulties in managing dependencies between stylesheets, and challenges in reconciling competing rules that frequently led to specificity wars. Engineers resorted to complex selectors and !important tags, making styles brittle and hard to maintain. Large, monolithic CSS bundles meant browsers were downloading hundreds of kilobytes of unused rules on every page load, slowing rendering and interaction. \nTo address these issues, Facebook built cx, a CSS-modules-like system that linked local CSS to JavaScript. cx resolved issues with namespace collisions and dependency management but remained limited to static styles defined in separate files.\n// ComponentName.css; class uses ComponentName/namespace syntax\r\n.ComponentName/header { margin-top: 10px }\r\n\r\n// ComponentName.js \r\n<div className={cx('ComponentName/header')} />\nWhen we rebuilt Facebook.com from the ground up, we had the opportunity to build something better. Around this time, the CSS-in-JS movement was gaining momentum. Developers increasingly wanted to colocate styles with component code, write dynamic styles based on runtime state, and leverage JavaScript paradigms like import graphs, module scoping, and type systems. But early CSS-in-JS systems relied on runtime injection: dynamically generating <style> tags and mutating the DOM during render, patterns that introduced measurable performance overhead.\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { margin: 10 }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({}) {\r\n  return <div {...styles.props(styles.foo)}/>\r\n}\r\n\nWe built on the lessons of this movement and made a system that is CSS-in-JS only in form, with styles compiling to static CSS. StyleX soon replaced our precursor cx system and transformed the way we approached styling. With StyleX, styles were now defined in JavaScript, enabling composition, conditional logic, and build-time compilation. Atomic classes reduced CSS size by 80% and made styling maintainable across a rapidly scaling codebase.\nToday, StyleX is the default styling system at Meta, powering everything from product surfaces to component libraries. Engineers use it to build interfaces that are expressive, reusable, and performant.\nInto the Compiler\nThe power of StyleX lies in its abstraction. We automatically handle CSS specificity, variable generation, and static compilation to generate predictable, collision-free atomic CSS. This avoids the maintenance overload of hand-authored CSS styles, allowing users to focus on style authoring. \nStyleX lives in a monorepo composed of several integrated packages. The core engine is a Babel plugin that runs a transform across a project and returns the extracted CSS. At a high level, the compiler traverses a set of files, extracts CSS metadata from style objects, and converts style declarations to atomic CSS classes. The collected metadata is then run through several processes: value normalization, at-rules wrapping, and legacy polyfills. Finally, the CSS rules are sorted and outputted into a static sheet.\n\nLet’s explore the behind-the-scenes of this process through the values of StyleX. \nScalability\nAt the heart of StyleX is its static compilation into atomic CSS. Styles are converted to classes containing a single style declaration for reuse across a codebase so CSS size plateaus as the application grows. Whenever possible, styles are compiled away and cached per file, so the system can analyze all reachable styles, deduplicate shared declarations, and emit only what’s needed at runtime.\nThe core API surface is intentionally lightweight:\nstylex.create() is used to define style objects. Objects are stripped away at build time and converted to atomic CSS. Each property: value pair is hashed and outputted as a CSS class. This API is designed for cacheability and only allows for statically resolvable values. \nstylex.props() handles merging and deduping of style objects. Each call is transpiled to an object containing a space-separated className string corresponding to each atomic style, and a style prop for dynamic styles. When styles are local to the module, we compile at build time; when styles are used across module boundaries, we defer to a tiny runtime merge.\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { margin: 10 }\r\n  bar: { margin: 10, color: 'red' }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({style}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n     <div {...styles.props(styles.foo)}/> \r\n     <div {...styles.props(styles.bar)}/> \r\n     <div {...stylex.props(style)}/> \r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\nIn each JavaScript file, API calls are replaced with the class names from the generated CSS and local styles are stripped away. The above component compiles to something like this:\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({style}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n     <div className=\"m-10\" />\r\n     <div className=\"c-red m-10\" /> \r\n     <div {...stylex.props(style)}/> \r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\nAfter the transform is run across files, we process the collected metadata, generate LTR/RTL variants, resolve constants, and order CSS rules by priority. The output is a string that can be emitted as a static stylesheet and post-processed by any of our bundlers.\n.m-10 { margin: 10px }\r\n.c-red { color: red }\r\n\nExpressiveness\nStyleX enforces constraints as design principles instead of limitations. We disallow conflict-prone patterns like styling at a distance and enforce patterns that are statically resolvable. Within these boundaries, however, StyleX remains expressive. We’ve designed for maximum flexibility within these constraints through the following APIs.\nShareable Values\nstylex.create()is designed for per-file cacheability: all CSS metadata must be derived solely from the JavaScript defined within that file. We use an extended version of Babel’s evaluate function to resolve values. The compiler never needs to read the contents of imported modules to generate the stylesheet. \nTo enable reusable values across files, we provide APIs like stylex.defineVars() and stylex.defineConsts(). These functions generate deterministic hashes based on variable name and import path that remain consistent across modules. This allows us to resolve variables anywhere they’re imported without traversing the file that declares them. At build time, shared constants are fully inlined, while shared variables become global CSS custom properties that can be referenced across components.\n// varsFile.stylex.js\r\nconst varColors = stylex.defineVars({primary: \"#eee\"})\r\n// constsFile.stylex.js\r\nconst constColors = stylex.defineConsts({primary: \"#fff\"})\r\n\r\n// Component.react.js\r\nimport {varColors} from 'varsFile.stylex.js' \r\nimport {constColors} from 'constsFile.stylex.js' \r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    foo: {color: varColors.primary} // → .x { var(--hash('varsFile.varColors.primary')) }\r\n    bar: {color: constColors.primary} // → hash('constsFile.constColors.primary') → #fff\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, StyleX is a system for styling components. Elements are styled using classnames. Global and complex selectors are disallowed to avoid styling at a distance: rules that affect elements indirectly from elsewhere in the DOM. Global baseline rules like element selectors or CSS resets must be defined in a separate stylesheet. This is to minimize indirect styling and promote encapsulation of styles.\n/* Unsafe: styles leak to child elements rather than being explicitly applied */\r\n.csuifyiu:hover > div { ... }\r\n\r\n/* Safe: styles are scoped to a specific element based on observed state */\r\ndiv:hover > .ksghfhjsfg { ... } \nHowever, we do allow observing from a distance using the stylex.when APIs. This API provides a suite of relational selectors to style a component based on the state of its ancestors, descendants, or siblings. Observed elements must be marked with stylex.defaultMarker(), ensuring styles remain directly applied while supporting contextual behavior.\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    foo: {\r\n      backgroundColor: {\r\n        default: 'blue',\r\n        [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover')]: 'red',\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\n<div {...stylex.props(stylex.defaultMarker())}>\r\n  <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo)}> Some Content </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\nPreserving CSS Features\nStyleX preserves most of the CSS feature set (media queries, pseudoclasses, keyframes, and more) through static transforms at build time. Wherever possible, we mirror native CSS behavior so styling feels expansive and familiar.\nWhile StyleX is built around static compilation, it also supports dynamic styles. When a value isn’t known at build time, the compiler emits a CSS variable reference, and the runtime writes it inline through the style prop. \nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    // Height is unknown until runtime\r\n    foo: (height) => ({\r\n      height,\r\n    }),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// { .d-height {var(--height)}, style: {--height: height} }\r\n<div {...stylex.props(styles.foo(height))}/> \r\n\nTheming APIs like stylex.defineVars() and stylex.createTheme() allow users to create and mutate shareable design tokens. defineVars() creates a variable grouping, and createTheme() allows users to create variants by redefining variable groups at a higher specificity.\n/* const spacing = stylex.defineVars({sm: 2px, md: 4px, lg: 8px}) */\r\n:root, .sp-group{--sp-sm:2px;--sp-md:4px;--sp-lg:8px;}\r\n\r\n/* const desktopSpacing = stylex.createTheme(spacing, {sm: 5px, md: 10px, lg: 20px}) */\r\n.sp-dktp.sp-dktp, .sp-dktp.sp-dktp:root{--sp-sm:5px;--sp-md:10px;--sp-lg:20px;}\r\n\nstylex.defineConsts() allows users to define shareable constants and media queries without overloading browser memory with CSS variables. During compilation, StyleX gathers metadata across all defineConsts() calls, generates placeholder hashes in  create() calls, and inlines the constant values directly into the generated stylesheet.\nFinally, APIs like stylex.keyframes() and stylex.viewTransitionClass() support animations by generating @keyframes and ::view-transition-* rules.\nPredictability\nStyleX is a system for styling components. We discourage global styling in favour of applying localized classnames on elements directly. Our design is centered around predictable style merging: The last style always wins! You can think of the stylex.props function as a deterministic merge of style objects: given stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar), bar always overrides foo. This makes it easy to share and combine styles predictably across files.\nCSS specificity follows a hierarchy where selectors are assigned different priorities. The calculation is based on a three-column value of IDs, classes, and types, commonly written as, (ID, Class, Type). Because StyleX is entirely class-based, resolving conflicts between style objects means determining which class names to apply and enforcing priorities between them. \nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { color: 'red', margin: 0 }\r\n  bar: { color: 'black', marginTop: 10 }\t\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  // becomes <div className=\"c-black m-0 mt-10\" /> \r\n  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar)} /> \r\n}\r\n\nDuring merge, repeated properties across style objects are deduplicated so that only the last value is applied. As a result, each class name in the DOM node corresponds to a single property. In the above example, the color: red class is dropped during merge so color: black takes precedence. But resolving overlaps between shorthands and constituent longhands is more complex. \nConsider the following HTML:\n<style>\r\n  .margin-top-10 { margin-top: 10px }\r\n  .margin-0 { margin: 0px }\r\n<style/>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"margin-0 margin-top-10\" />\r\n\nWhen multiple classes are applied on a div, the resulting styling is based solely on the specificity of the selectors (in this case, the order of the classes). Without additional handling, margin overrides margin-top here completely! \nThrow pseudoclasses and media queries in the mix and things become even more complex:\n{\r\n   [ \"m-0\", { \"css\": \".m-10 {margin: 0}\" }, 3000 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10\", { \"css\": \".mt-10 {margin-top: 10px}\", }, 4000 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10-mq\", { \"css\": \"@media (...) {.mt-10-mq {margin-top: 10px} }\", }, 4200 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10-mq\", { \"css\": \"@media (...) {.mt-10-mq:hover {margin-top: 10px} }\", }, 4320 ], \r\n}\r\n\nTo handle this ambiguity, we compute a numerical priority alongside each CSS rule. We use these priorities alongside a user-configured styleResolution to determine the specificity of each class selector using the @layer at-rule or equivalent polyfill. \nThe enforced ordering looks something like this: \n\nThe result? Longhands and shorthands merge predictably, :active states override :hover states, media queries override default behaviour, and user-authored order is respected when possible. This behind-the-scenes specificity handling allows developers to combine and reuse styles without manually resolving conflicts.\nLooking Forward\nStyleX is maintained by a team of CSS enthusiasts who aim to make styling accessible to everyone. Beyond the compiler, the monorepo includes an ESLint plugin for style validation, a CLI for easy stylesheet generation, a PostCSS plugin for post-processing, and an experimental CSS parser. \nThe open source community has played an important role in shaping the direction of StyleX, and been a massive force multiplier in our work. We continue to learn, grow, and ideate in collaboration with the companies and individuals adopting our work. Today, with the help of thousands of contributors, the ecosystem includes a community-built playground, VS Code extensions, an SWC compiler, multiple bundler integrations, and more!\nWe’re always exploring new ways to make StyleX the styling system for the modern web. Our work is an ongoing dialogue between the needs of the community and the values that guide our design. Roadmap highlights include an API for shareable functions, LLM-ready context files, support for inline styles, developer extensions, strict compiler validation, logical styles utilities, and an official unplugin for bundler integrations. Our goal is to continue to evolve alongside the browser and keep imagining what styling on the web can be.\nHappy style authoring! We make StyleX for you.\nLearn More\nTo hear the latest on StyleX, check out the StyleX website, GitHub, Bluesky and X. \nTo learn more about Meta Open Source, visit our website, subscribe to our YouTube channel, or follow us on Facebook, Threads, X, Bluesky and LinkedIn.\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to past maintainers Naman Goel and Sebastian McKenzie; contributors Frank Yan, Jerry Su, Ankit Sardesai, Joel Austin, Daniel Neiter, Nicolas Gallagher, Vincent Riemer, Ezzudin Alkotob, Andrey Sukhachev, Nitish Mehrotra, Nadiia D., Prakshal Jain, JC Pérez Chávez, Samantha Zhan, Chang Yan, Tina Gao, Anay Bhakat; advisors Christopher Chedeau, Baraa Hamodi, Dennis Wilkins, Chris Callahan, Richard Hansen, Robert Maratos, Will Hastings, Ricky Li, Andrew Imm, Tim Yung, Eli White; Modern CSS leads; the Web Platform org; the open source community; and the lineage of systems like React Native and Linaria that continue to inspire our work.\nThe post StyleX: A Styling Library for CSS at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Only prompt engineering matters now. Actually, I heard it’s overrated. You think we’re gonna be prompting in 5 years? 2 years? Nonsense. All this hype is being blown so out of proportion. Have some healthy skepticism. Have a lot of healthy skepticism. Doubt. Believe. Move to the woods. Bury your laptop in the back yard. Get bored. Dig it up again. Coding is back, baby! Start another course, work on it for a few days. Lose motivation. Panic. Repeat.\nYou’re not alone. As a writer, I’m also panicking. Why read this when you could ask the same question to your LLM of choice and have a lively discussion perfectly tuned to be as broad or technical, long or short, playful or serious, as you want it to be? This thought has tormented me for days and this post remained a blank document. The only thing that saved me was remembering why I made this series in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to create a resource for learners to better understand programming within the context of our new AI world. I made a case for why it’s still worth learning to code, explored the psychology of beginner programmers, and discussed whether you should use AI at all. So, now what? \nWe know that programming will change – that programming has changed. But how exactly? And how much? What knowledge can we be sure will remain fundamental? What should we learn to prepare for the worlds to come?\nThere are a variety of answers depending on where you as the answerer stand. Is your net worth positively correlated with AI hype? Is your job too complicated, social, or important for AI? How is your relationship with risk? How do you feel about change? What do you believe about what the future needs? \n\n\n\n\nThese are not questions anyone can answer for you. Not me, not a tech CEO, not your mom, and certainly not a chatbot. We live in a world with platforms and educational institutions jumping to answer “What can I learn?” (a small reminder to check out our catalog of free courses), but there are very few resources that will give good answers to questions like “What should I learn?”, “Can you really justify why?”, and “Can you promise me it will remain useful?”.\nI can’t guarantee that anything you learn will remain useful in the years to come, but I am certain that learning will. On that subject, here are a few short recommendations on how to prepare for the future of programming.\nUnderstand the flaws of your education\nAre you in a large institution that is slow to adapt? Is AI use being discussed openly or banned from the classroom? Are you self-studying at your own pace, but lack any network of peers or mentors? Is your education giving you a broad overview of a field (a Bachelor’s degree) or is it leading you toward specialization and a specific job (bootcamp/internship)? \nBoth of these approaches are useful, they’re just working on different timelines. A broad overview can give you more options when the field changes, while a specialization can help you in the short term. Either way, try to compensate in the direction of your weaknesses so you’re not left either overqualified and underemployed, or unemployable when your only skill becomes redundant.\n\n\n\n\n📚 An exercise: Take 10 to 20 minutes to reflect on your education from a zoomed-out perspective. Think about what it did or is doing well and what gaps you might be left with at the end of it. Below you’ll find a few recommendations on how to fill those gaps, but feel free to brainstorm your own as well.\nHow to broaden your knowledge\nIf you’ve got practical skills but worry about their shelf life, now is the time to foster curiosity about the wider scope of your field. This will feel different than learning a practical skill, since there are fewer concrete ways to assess your progress. Instead, pay attention to the moments when ideas from different domains click together. This is a sign that you’re starting to expand your general knowledge and get a clearer view of the big picture.\nHere are some practical ways to do this:\n🧑‍🎓 Follow short courses in other domains. Our knowledge map can help you visualize what subjects you might find interesting to explore, or you can even consider departing from computing altogether. Bringing technical expertise to a writing course might lead to great science fiction, or an interesting exercise in applied philosophy.\n🧰 Work on projects that use a broad skillset but don’t require professional excellence. Make a silly app that needs a little bit of frontend, a little bit of backend, knowledge of APIs, and even graphic design. It might be ugly and inefficient, the point is that you did it.\n\nSince motivation might be difficult to maintain on your own, find someone with a different skillset and swap roles.\n👯 If you consider yourself a “technical person”, focus especially on communication skills and critical thinking. These are particularly important in navigating the uncertain future we’re facing, since purely technical jobs are in many ways the easiest to automate away.\nHow to deepen your knowledge\nPersonally, I find it really hard to specialize. I jump between interests, rarely sticking with anything long enough to achieve mastery. This used to stress me out – how could I be good at my job if I couldn’t commit to one thing? But I’ve learned that the pressure to specialize is often about legibility, not capability. We like people who are easy to categorize. In practice, though, proficiency in one skill lends itself to an easier time with others.\nDepth is what makes you adaptable. Surface-level knowledge can get outdated quickly. Understanding underlying principles like how systems actually work, not just how to use them, means you can transfer what you know to new tools and frameworks. When the landscape shifts, you’re not starting from scratch.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll have to choose your approach depending on the specific skill you want to master. Here’s how to do this:\n🧑‍🏫 Get advice from someone who’s done it before, ideally someone who can personally mentor you. To get started, there are plenty of “Things I wish I’d known before becoming x” videos, which might help you wade through what’s necessary and what’s not. \n💻 Regarding coding, our specializations courses provide very comprehensive and practical assignments in various domains.\n💯 If you, like me, quickly lose interest once the novelty wears off, I can recommend tailoring your media diet toward your target subject. Reading books and listening to stories of people talking about your subject on a high level helps you remember what sparked your interest in the first place. To start, you could check out our video essay on the history of Git!\nGoodbye, AI world\nYou don’t need to understand tech to do things with it anymore. Now you can build apps, write code, or generate designs without understanding the underlying systems. There’s real value in that accessibility, but as a writer and coder, I worry about what we lose. If we go all-in on doing things, we might forget that developing deep knowledge and understanding can be fun and good for us. It might even be a requirement for our mental health and self-esteem. To not only be able to make an app, but to take pride in the fact that you learned how to.\nGet a free student license\n                                                                Explore our course catalog\n                                    \nThis is the fourth and final post in our series How to Learn to Program in an AI World.

You might sketch a part, adjust parameters, skip ahead, then revisit earlier sections to refine them. \nDiffusion models, and in particular diffusion large language models (d-LLMs), operate differently from current coding assistants. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate token by token in a strict left-to-right sequence, d-LLMs condition on both past and future context. This enables them to model edits and refinements more directly, reflecting how developers iteratively construct and adjust code. As shown by Gong et al. (2025): “the [d-LLM] model often plans token generation more globally, much like a programmer jumping back and forth through code to refine a code implementation.” This matches the reality of code authorship, which is non-linear: you sketch a bit, revise earlier parts, jump ahead, and keep iterating.\nOut-of-order generation feels more human\nOne of the most striking demos of diffusion-based models like DiffuCoder showed exactly this: the model skipped a parameter mid-function, continued writing later parts, then circled back to fill in what was missing.\n\n\n\n\n(The prompt used here is: “Write a Python function to implement binary search together with docstrings and type hints.” The example is generated using the apple/DiffuCoder-7B-Instruct model, configured to produce one token per forward pass with a limit of 256 new tokens. The blue slots illustrate positions that the model later revisits and refines during the diffusion process.)\nThis structure may mirror how many developers think. You may not know every detail upfront, but you can scaffold a function and refine as you go. A model that generates in a sequential way is better suited to support this process.\nBi-directional context improves reasoning\nAutoregressive models can be prompted to consider bidirectional context by providing both prefix and suffix in the prompt, but this remains a workaround rather than a native capability. Diffusion models, particularly diffusion large language models (d-LLMs), are designed from the ground up to condition on both past and future context during generation.\nThis design proves valuable for tasks requiring reversal reasoning, where coherence must hold in both directions, and for code generation, where a variable’s usage downstream should inform its earlier definition. As shown by Nie at al. (2025), d-LLMs exhibit “consistent zero-shot performance across both forward and reversal tasks.”\nFor developers, this translates into improved handling of structured logic, long-range dependencies, and code constraints that depend on order-sensitive relationships.\nFlexibility in editing and refactoring\nBecause diffusion models mask and unmask tokens gradually at any random position, they are naturally suited to infilling. If you ask a diffusion model to rewrite a block of code with a different parameter or to refactor a loop into a comprehension, it can directly operate on masked sections. \nThe distinction with autoregressive LLMs is subtle here, since both require the relevant code region to appear in the prompt. Where diffusion models add value is in integration with deterministic tooling such as IDEs. An IDE could highlight several problematic or incomplete regions, mask them, and allow the diffusion model to unmask and regenerate all affected parts in a single coherent pass. This distinguishes diffusion models from FIM-enabled autoregressive models, which can handle isolated infilling but struggle to maintain global consistency across multiple edits.\nExample: coordinated multi-region updates\nConsider adding a field to a class that must be initialised in the constructor, used in a method, and serialised elsewhere. Rather than orchestrating multiple FIM calls or regenerating entire methods, a diffusion model can mask the relevant locations and generate all necessary updates at once. \nThis makes diffusion models well-suited to refactoring tasks where changes must satisfy global constraints, such as ensuring a new parameter appears consistently in a function signature, its documentation, call sites, and test cases.\nFor example, an IDE might flag a type mismatch in a function signature. Instead of regenerating the entire function, a diffusion model could unmask just the problematic parameter declaration and rewrite it to match the expected type, leaving the rest of the code untouched. This localised editing process mirrors how developers typically fix errors and refactor code incrementally.\nPotential speed improvements\nAutoregressive models operate sequentially, generating one token per forward pass. Diffusion models, by contrast, can produce multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Benchmarks reveal a current practical shortcoming: increasing the number of tokens per step often reduces quality. The underlying mechanism, however, allows faster inference and is likely to improve in future.\nResearchers have proposed semi-autoregressive approaches to bridge the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based generation – most notably Block Diffusion – Arriola et al. (2025). This method generates blocks of tokens from left to right while allowing diffusion models to unmask flexibly within each block. In principle, this allows reuse of the KV cache, which plays a key role in the efficiency of autoregressive models. In practice, however, unmasking too many tokens in parallel creates a trade-off. Throughput increases, but quality often drops sharply, especially if the KV cache is not reused carefully.\nSemi-autoregressive generation represents an intermediate step between autoregressive and truly out-of-order inference. Diffusion-based language models work fundamentally out of sequence, yet current methods still borrow ideas from autoregressive design, such as KV cache reuse, because the optimisation tools for autoregressive generation remain highly developed and effective. Ironically, these mature autoregressive mechanisms improve generation speed even as research moves towards models that can generate fully out of order.\nCurrent limitations\nFor now, developers should temper expectations. Our internal experimentations with latest open-source models show that:\nThe best quality comes when unmasking one token per step, which slows things down and makes these models not differ much from AR models in practice.\nDiffusion models can repeat prefixes or suffixes, or even output incoherent text when pushed too far.\n\nRepetition: model re-outputs entire prefix blocks multiple times.\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef factorial(n):   # repeated\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef factorial(n):   # repeated again\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\nEarly termination: incomplete function bodies or truncated expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(   # truncated, no argument\nMalformed syntax: unmatched brackets, dangling commas, or gibberish tokens.\ndef factorial(n):\n    if (n == 0:\n        return 1,\n    else:\n        return n ** factorial[n - 1))\nBenchmarking current state-of-the-art d-LLMs – open source (DiffuCoder, Seed-Diffusion) and closed-source (Mercury, Gemini-Diffusion) – shows mixed performance when compared against strong autoregressive baselines such as Qwen2.5-Coder. See Gong et al. (2025) and Song, Yuxuan et al. (2025).\nDespite these issues, diffusion models still introduce valuable new possibilities for code generation and editing. At the same time, their ecosystem is very immature compared to autoregressive LLMs. \nTraining and inference techniques that help mitigate sequential bottlenecks in LLMs, such as chunked prefill, speculative decoding, or prefix caching, have no direct equivalents yet for diffusion models. \nDiffusion also requires defining output length in advance, which often leads to inefficiency compared to the <eos> termination signal in LLMs. \nFinally, the open-source diffusion models for code makes it harder for developers to experiment and refine these methods.\nWhere they can be useful today\nCode completion with context editing – filling in missing parts of a function rather than only extending text.\nRefactoring support – restructuring code blocks where order is less rigid.\nStructured text tasks – mathematical reasoning or reversal problems where bi-directional context matters.\n\n\n\n\nThese niches give developers a reason to experiment, even if production-ready tools remain a little way off. Beyond these early applications, the major promise of d-LLMs lies in their potential for much faster generation, since they can produce N tokens per forward pass rather than one. \nThis capability could eventually reshape performance expectations for coding assistants once the quality–efficiency trade-offs are better understood.\nLooking ahead\nDiffusion models won’t replace autoregressive models overnight. But they represent a new paradigm that better reflects how developers think and work. Their ability to edit flexibly, consider context in both directions, and potentially accelerate inference sets them apart.\nFor developers, the practical benefit is clear: more snappy generation, and more support for the unstructured, iterative way you actually write code.\nAs research continues, diffusion models could become the backbone of coding assistants that feels less like next token generators and more like principled, code structure-aware, programming collaborators.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Major Spring Framework releases don’t come around often – and when they do, they tend to reshape how we build applications for years to come. Spring Framework 7 is one of those releases. It simplifies many aspects of development, cleans up some long-standing pain points, and introduces features that previously required custom annotations or boilerplate-heavy workarounds.\nThe IntelliJ IDEA team has been keeping pace since the early milestones, working closely with the Spring Framework team to ensure smooth integration and reliable tooling support. We truly appreciate their collaboration, insights, and early feedback – this release wouldn’t have been possible without their help and expertise. If you’re already experimenting with Spring 7, you’ll be happy to know that IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 is ready for it out of the box.\nLet’s explore the most prominent features of Spring 7 and see how IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 helps you make the most of it.\nREST API Versioning\nIf you’ve ever had to version an API manually, you know the pain: URL gymnastics, header verification, parsing and comparing SemVer strings, etc. Spring 7 finally introduces a built-in, first-class versioning mechanism. You can now define versions right in your mapping annotations:\n@GetMapping(path = \"/quote\", version = \"1.0+\")\n\nResponseEntity<Quote> getQuote() {\n\n        Quote result = quoteService.getRandomQuote();\n\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);\n\n    }\nIntelliJ IDEA detects this automatically. The IDE checks whether versioning is configured in your app, identifies whether you’re using a property or the ApiVersionConfigurer class, and even warns you if something’s off. If you forgot to enable versioning, the IDE doesn’t just underline the issue – it tells you how to fix it.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, IntelliJ IDEA suggests using property-based configuration that enables versioning through a header attribute. It’s a safe starting point, and you can tweak it later if you’re doing something fancy.\nspring.mvc.apiversion.use.header=Api-Version\nAnd yes, you can Ctrl+Click on the version in the @GetMapping annotation to jump straight to your configuration code. The IDE also checks that your version values follow standard SemVer rules. \n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a custom version parser, IntelliJ IDEA won’t interfere.\nTesting versioned APIs\nWhen it comes to testing, you can do it in a straightforward way and keep things simple. \nmockMvc.perform(get(\"/api/quote\")\n\n                        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n\n                        .header(\"API-Version\", \"1.0\")\n\n                )\nOn the other hand, Spring 7 lets you configure API versioning for tests and provides a new API – apiVersion method:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA knows about this API and will help you to configure versioning for tests. For the header-based versioning, the code will look like this:\n@TestConfiguration\n\nstatic class QuoteControllerTestConfig implements MockMvcBuilderCustomizer {\n\n        @Override\n\n        public void customize(ConfigurableMockMvcBuilder<?> builder) {\n\n            builder.apiVersionInserter(ApiVersionInserter.useHeader(\"Api-Version\"));\n\n        }\n\n    }\nThis configuration lets you define your versioning approach in a single class, which greatly simplifies test maintenance.\nHTTP Interface Clients\nDeclarative HTTP clients have been part of Spring since version 6, but they used to require quite a bit of boilerplate code. Spring 7 makes it much simpler: one interface, one annotation, done. Versions are supported as well.\nExample:\n@HttpExchange(url = \"http://quotes.server.com:8080/api/\")\n\ninterface QuoteClient {\n\n    @GetExchange(url = \"/quote\", version = \"1.0\")\n\n    Quote fetchRandomQuote();\n\n}\nIn Spring 7, registration is very straightforward. Just add the following annotation to a @Configuration class:\n@ImportHttpServices(types = QuoteClient.class)\nAs of now, to support versioning in the HTTP Interface client, you still need to write configuration manually. We’ll improve it in the nearest IntelliJ IDEA updates.\nspring.http.serviceclient.default.apiversion.default-version=1.0.0\n\nspring.http.serviceclient.default.apiversion.insert.header=API-Version\nIntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 recognizes HTTP interfaces as beans – no more “red squiggly lines” or “cannot resolve bean” warnings. You get full autocompletion, navigation, and injection support wherever these clients are used.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see where each client is referenced – right from the gutter icons or in the Structure tool window. It’s a small thing, but it saves time when you’re tracing through yet another microservice.\nLooking ahead, we are working on inspections that will detect unregistered clients or incorrect imports, and even help generate clients from OpenAPI specs. In short, let developers spend less time wiring HTTP clients, and more time improving the API they call.\nDynamic Bean Registration\nHere’s something new: the BeanRegistrar interface. Sometimes you need to register beans dynamically, and @Conditional annotations just don’t cut it. Spring 7 now lets you do this cleanly:\npublic class QuoteProviderRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderDb\", QuoteProviderDb.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderFallback\", QuoteProviderFallback.class);\n\n    }\n\n}\nIf your bean construction logic gets complex or depends on multiple factors, programmatic bean registration is a neat way to handle it. IntelliJ IDEA recognizes these beans dynamically, so you won’t see those annoying “unresolved injection” warnings anymore. You can navigate straight from the injection point right to the registrar – those familiar little green bean icons in the gutter have got you covered.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the IDE can’t anticipate every edge case of dynamic registration – that’s where the Spring Debugger comes in. When you’re debugging a complex setup, it shows you exactly what’s injected at runtime. \nConclusion\nSpring 7 is packed with new features – from built-in resilience support and updated Jackson integration to Spring Data AOT repositories, just to name a few. \nThe IntelliJ IDEA team works hard to ensure everything runs seamlessly in your projects, so that you can stay productive and take advantage of the latest technologies. As Spring 7 adoption grows, we will continue adding features that help you focus on your code, not the framework.",

It’s a good example of the vague terms that occasionally make the rounds in developer circles without much to qualify them. \nWe’ve collected opinions on the subject, metrics, and code risks that you can use to discuss what “bad” quality is for your team and how to improve it. \nWhat is bad code?\nBad code is a general term that developers, project managers, and other stakeholders use as a catch-all for a range of coding problems – bugs, smells, security issues – that contribute to low readability, maintainability, and scalability. It doesn’t just refer to codebases that have issues or don’t work like they’re supposed to. \nIn different cases, bad code refers to anything not optimized for performance and maintenance, from confusing variable names to functions that loop using too much memory. \nYour code could be described as bad if it’s:\nDifficult for other people to understand during code reviews.\nHard to maintain or scale over time.\nNot written with correct styling and formatting.\nNot well documented. \nProne to bugs and breaking. \nInsecure or vulnerable to breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll get into each of these points in more depth, but it’s important to acknowledge that no codebase is perfect. There will be times when license incompatibilities take priority over style changes or security vulnerabilities trump other issues. The definition of bad code is contextual and changes depending on its surroundings. That said, there are some general red flags that can signal bad code. Let’s look at some of the most important ones. \nAndrei Petrov, DevOps Engineer in Qodana Cloud\nSimple is beautiful. Everything that is not simple and looks clever is “bad” for me. I want to cite Edsger W. Dijkstra on this: Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. If it is not simple it is not reliable.\nHard to read or understand\nWhether someone is peer reviewing your code or making changes, they have to know what everything means. Using variable names like x1, yz, or data can make your codebase hard to decipher. Likewise, a file called xyzService, which uses mixed indentation styles and has all of its work inside a 500-line function called doStuff, is hard to read and challenging to work with.\nDifficult to maintain\nWhen code is hard to understand, it’s also hard to maintain. For example, if you have one function that handles web requests, database logic, and data formatting, any tiny change to the code risks breaking it. Additionally, poorly written legacy codebases can lead to high technical debt when code needs to be refactored as a direct result of shortcuts in the original work.\nHard to scale\nGood code should be adaptable and able to grow functionally, handling more traffic or data without impacting performance. Hard-to-scale code can be bad code, as it leads to performance issues over time and can cause longer maintenance processes.\nInsecure or vulnerable\nSimple errors and issues with your code can lead to vulnerabilities and create the potential for breaches. Insecure code can be caused by issues such as inserting user input directly into an SQL query without sanitizing it. In this case, a malicious user could expose all user data with a simple input. At Qodana, we strongly emphasize security alongside code quality because unsafe code is bad code, especially in the context of the AI boom.\nProne to bugs and breaking\nIf your code doesn’t consider potential issues, it may be bad code. Any codebase that doesn’t account for invalid user inputs, loops, arrays, or other possible issues could cause problems when it inevitably breaks, especially if it does so after “hiding” for some time.\nLow performance or inefficiency\nPerformance problems make code bad, like a for loop that makes a database call for every single item in it. This can increase the time it takes a page to load or even cause timeouts. A study from the University of Washington showed the impact of inefficient database queries. The study found that fixing these types of issues led to a 98% decrease in webpage response time. \nNot aligned with ways of working\nWhen code doesn’t follow accepted workflows and style regulations, it forces your teammates to slow down, unpack differences, and guess the intent, even if it works. This can lead to significant technical debt. Examples include choosing to use horizontal or vertical indents, having defined line lengths, or figuring out early what your approach will be for using variables.\nPublic commentary from Marius Anderie on Medium\n\n\n\nDefining bad code is good practice\nDefining bad code vs. good code drives quality and efficiency in your output. It makes sure code is fit-for-purpose, helps teams collaborate more easily, lowers technical debt, and leads to the development of performance-led code designed for longevity and scalability.\nIt’s important that everyone working on a project knows what bad code looks like in their specific case. What might be considered bad code in one project could be considered fine in another. Being able to draw the line between the two makes expectations clearer and allows developers to better understand what bad code is. Our Leadership Series features an interview with Vlad Minaev, WebStorm Team Lead, that explores this topic.\nHaving defined parameters for bad code also helps developers understand what to avoid when they have to be more agile. For example, if there are time constraints to consider, what should they be sure to steer clear of to keep code quality high?\nThe impact of bad code\nWe spoke a little bit about how bad code can affect your ability to scale your products, maintain your codebase and preserve your team’s sanity. But let’s look at how bad code can have significant implications for your business in more detail:\nLowering scalability: Unoptimized loops or blocking calls that seem okay during testing can crash your system when user traffic increases. What worked before launch suddenly doesn’t when you need it the most. \nTechnical debt: Bad code makes it difficult and more expensive to correct issues or make future changes to the codebase. One study carried out in 2022 found that fixing technical debt issues consumes as much as 25% of development time.\nBreaching user trust: Bad code directly affects users. For example, a bug that exposes personal data or crashes during checkout can undo months of good customer acquisition work. Users remember bad experiences much more than good ones.\nLosing talent: Retaining good developer talent can also relate directly to the quality of your codebase. Top engineers don’t want to work on codebases filled with issues, where every file reveals a new layer of problems.\nDamaging productivity: Bad code wastes valuable time and impacts productivity, whether it’s causing developers to spend longer deciphering code or spending more time updating and maintaining trickier code. QA cycles may also get longer due to complexity, while fixes get more complex and time-consuming in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n    \nLev Liadov, Software Developer in the Qodana Frontend Team\nBad code is code that forces you into an infinite cycle of fixing one part and breaking another.\nHow to reduce bad code\nThere are plenty of ways to reduce bad code in your codebase, including: \nUnderstand the task: Don’t start coding straight away. Step back, ask questions, and ensure you fully understand the brief. Writing a problem summary will also help lay out expected inputs, outputs, and constraints and turn abstract concepts into real targets.\nChoose the simple option: A clever algorithm that saves time today could cost time tomorrow. If you can’t explain your code in under a minute, rewrite it with collaboration in mind. \nDon’t repeat yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicate code. When you duplicate lines of code, you duplicate bugs and other problems, which can lead to time-consuming fixes required in multiple areas. Follow the rule of three – if you have to write similar code more than twice, turn it into a reusable function.\nWrite small, focused functions: Ensure your functions do what’s intended and don’t creep too much. Small sections of code are easier to understand and test. Keep functions under 30 lines, each doing one job.\nUse meaningful names: Names in your codebase need to be usable. As they’re what people read most often, you should always ensure names for things like variables, functions, and any other identifiers make it clear what they are and what their purpose is to anyone reading your code.\nTest regularly: Implement tests that check overall behaviour and targeted tests for critical algorithms. Regular testing allows you to refactor without fear because you know that when you break something, you can go back to the previous version.\nUse static code analysis tools and peer reviews: Static code analysis tools check for issues in your code, like unused variables, unreachable branches, or security risks. Combine these checks with peer reviews for a tighter review system where everyone shares responsibility for code quality.\nStyle guides and governance: Agree on an internal style guide for your code and stick to it. Consistency allows developers to focus on what the code can do instead of how it looks.\nPrioritize security: Validate inputs, encode outputs, and handle secrets like ​​API keys and passwords correctly by storing them securely using environment variables or secret-management tools. When reviewing code, look for injection attacks and race conditions.\nDocument decisions: Grey areas cause bad code. Document the rationale behind approaches. Why did you choose optimistic locking over pessimistic? Why does the service process events asynchronously instead of synchronously?\nRefactor incrementally: Rebuilding from scratch can introduce new bugs, delaying production. Incremental refactoring processes like code cleanups, replacing legacy patterns, and optimizing slow database queries are often less disruptive, while also making it easier to spot coding problems along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nWise words from Smoothiride700 on Reddit \n\n\n\nBad code is a problem that can lead to costly problems for development teams, projects, and wider businesses. Removing the vagueness from the terminology and knowing what bad code looks like can help you catch problems earlier, make it easier to fix issues, and lower the impact of bad code on your bottom line.\nSpot bad code issues in your codebase with the Qodana code quality tool.",

        "pubDate": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 15:49:55 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Last year marked the first time we shipped ReSharper and Rider side by side with the official .NET SDK release – and we’re happy to announce that we’ve done it again with the 2025.3 release!\nDownload Rider 2025.3 Download ReSharper 2025.3\nWith .NET 10 and C# 14, both ReSharper and Rider are ready on day one to help you explore the latest language features. Whether you’re diving into extension members, testing out user-defined compound assignment operators, or cleaning up your code with the new field keyword, ReSharper and Rider have your back with inspections, quick-fixes, and refactorings that just work.\nExtension Members\nOne of the most anticipated features in C# 14 are extension members, which have been discussed for quite a while now. Previously, the concept was limited to extension methods (introduced with C# 3), which enabled us to add instance methods to any type we wanted. For instance, the popular Humanizer project is all about adding extensions to manipulate and display primitive types. Until now, you could be sure that all non-instance methods come from the original type – including properties, static members, and operators – but brace yourself! In the spirit of the original issue, we are about to extension everything in C# 14!\nargs <<= args.Count + string.ZeroWidthSpace; // 🫣\r\n\r\nfile static class ExtensionMembers\r\n{\r\n    extension<T>(T[] array)\r\n    {\r\n        public void operator <<= (T item) => array[^1] = item;\r\n        public int Count => array.Count;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    extension(string)\r\n    {\r\n        public static string ZeroWidthSpace => \"\\u200b\";\r\n    }\r\n}\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nIf you’ve been considering advancing your extension library with the use of extension members, now is a good time to do so. ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 come with quick-fixes and context actions to:\nConvert to Extension Block,\nConvert to Classic Extension Methods, and\nMove to Extension Block\nRefactor to extension block and back to classic extension methods\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our support for extension members, we also updated all our existing features to work smoothly, including the Change Signature, and Convert Method to Property refactoring, and the call tracking and value tracking.\nNull-Conditional Assignment\nThe null-conditional operator has been a great addition in C# 6 to reduce the number of null-checks we have to write in our codebase – whether for member access (?.) or element access (?[]). One limitation has been that expressions that use the operator could only be on the right side of an assignment. With C# 14, this constraint has been lifted, and ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 help you convert relevant fragments to use null propagation:\nQuick-fix to use null propagation\n\n\n\n\nField Keyword Updates\nThe field keyword for properties has been introduced in C# 13 as a preview feature. We added day-zero support in 2025.2 to help you convert from explicit backing fields and modernize your codebase quickly. In C# 14, the field keyword has matured to a fully stable language feature, but some details about the nullability of backing fields have changed. More specifically, the compiler now correctly infers the nullability of backing fields for lazy initializations, which allows us to stop emitting [field: AllowNull, MaybeNull] during conversion in ReSharper and Rider 2025.3:\nQuick-fix to replace backing field with field keyword\n\n\n\n\nPartial Constructors & Events\nFor the release of C# 13, we added support for partial properties and indexers. With C# 14, you can also use partial constructors and events. Just like with extension members, we can partial everything:\n// Declaration\r\npartial class WeatherService\r\n{\r\n    partial WeatherService();\r\n    partial event EventHandler DataReceived;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Implementation\r\npartial class WeatherService\r\n{\r\n    partial WeatherService() { }\r\n\r\n    partial event EventHandler DataReceived\r\n    {\r\n        add => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n        remove => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n    }\r\n}\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nWhile this feature enables more control for source generators, ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 also have you covered in pure user-code scenarios. You can implement partial constructors and events in multiple ways, including:\nUsing the Implement member in another part of class quick-fix\nUsing the Generate Code action from the Alt+Enter menu\nUsing code completion after typing partial\nGenerating partial constructors\n\n\n\n\nJust like for partial properties and methods, you can also:\nManage the visibility from any declaration\nMerge members into one declaration\nManipulating and merging partial constructors\n\n\n\n\nSimple Lambda Parameters with Modifiers\nSupport for this language feature was introduced in our 2025.1 release. You can read about it in this blog post here.\nNameof with Unbound Generics\nThat’s another feature our 2025.1 release introduced support for. More about that here. \nBreaking Changes involving Span<T>\nDue to the more refined span conversion and type inference rules, you might see compilation errors about ambiguity or incompatible return types. For instance, when targeting net9.0 with the language version 14.0 (which, after all, is an unsupported scenario), an enumerable.Reverse() call now resolves to MemoryExtensions.Reverse(this Span<T>). For this and all similar cases, we’ve added an inspection with an accompanying quick-fix to choose your preferred workaround:\nQuick-fix for breaking changes from Span<T> APIs\n\n\n\n\nUser-Defined Compound Assignment Operators\nImplementing operator overloads can be a lot of fun – especially the division operator / for path concatenation! But did you know that when rewriting an assignment like a = a + b as a compound assignment a += b, the new value is not created in the most efficient way? Essentially, the compiler still uses the original + operator overload to create a new value, which then replaces the original value of a. Especially when used with heavy data types, like BigInteger, this can have significant performance implications. C# 14 introduces user-defined compound assignments to solve this issue and allow in-place changes without new allocations:\nSyntax highlighting for used-defined compound assignment operators\n\n\n\n\nReSharper and Rider 2025.3 allow you to spot user-defined operators more easily due to their syntax highlighting, to find usages from declarations, as well as to navigate from usages to the declaration.\nAnd that’s it for now\nThese updates ensure that your favorite JetBrains tools are ready for everything C# 14 brings — from enhanced extension syntax to new compiler behaviors and smarter refactorings.\nFor a complete overview of the latest changes and performance improvements, check out the What’s New pages for ReSharper 2025.3 and Rider 2025.3.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 Download ReSharper 2025.3",

This update is the result of extensive collaboration with developers and incorporates valuable feedback from the community. We’ve improved typography, iconography, and the overall layout to minimize distractions and keep your code front and center. Each update is designed to support modern workflows, making Visual Studio a more intuitive, consistent, and personal experience.\nDownload the Insiders release and try our new visual improvements, AI integrated development capabilities, and latest performance improvements that reset expectations for speed at enterprise scale.\nA design that puts your code first\nOne of the biggest feedback themes we heard from you was clarity. Developers told us that small inconsistencies and visual noise add up, especially on dense screens and large solutions. To address that, we refined the visual details of many elements, improved the layout and overall spacing to make navigation clearer, and to reduce distractions. Our goal was to minimize distractions and enable greater productivity by allowing you to focus on your work more efficiently.\n\nFrom the moment you launch Visual Studio 2026, you’ll notice the updated Get Started and What’s New experiences. These aren’t just visual upgrades; they’re designed to preview a smoother, more developer-friendly workflow that keeps your code front and center.\n\n \nA new settings experience: modern, consistent, and transparent\nVisual Studio 2026 introduces a completely redesigned settings experience, built for transparency, consistency, and ease of use. Our aim was to modernize how settings are managed, making them easier to discover and adjust. The new interface provides a streamlined, intuitive way to configure your environment, an improved search that delivers more accurate and better organized results, and, for those who want direct control, a new underlying JSON file that makes every change visible and trackable in real time.\nThe settings interface is now fully themed, so your preferences carry through the look and feel of the IDE in a transparent and accessible way that fits modern development workflows.\n\nWe’ve converted most of the popular settings and are actively working to add more. For any settings not yet updated, you’ll find them under a More Settings node, which provides legacy links to their respective areas. This approach ensures your workflow remains uninterrupted as we continue to enhance the overall experience.\nThemes that feel personal (and accessible by default)\nPersonalization matters, but so does readability. That’s why we’re introducing 11 new tinted themes that incorporate subtle color accents onto Light or Dark backgrounds, enabling you to select an appearance that matches your environment or mood. Our built-in themes boost accessibility enhancements such as increased contrast and improved text legibility, designed to minimize eye strain and support users with specific needs.\n \n\nIf you develop themes or extensions, keep an eye out for updated guidance coming soon. We’ll provide tips and best practices to help you craft unique and engaging experiences in the refreshed Visual Studio 2026 environment.\nNew editor appearance: your code, your way\nWe recognize how important it is to customize your IDE experience. Alongside the new collection of themes, we’ve added an editor appearance setting that lets you choose whether the editor matches the IDE theme or stands apart.\nFor those who need or prefer higher contrast, there are now additional extra contrast options available specifically for the editor. These updates make it easier to personalize Visual Studio while also supporting accessibility and readability needs.\n\n\nYour editor font family, size, and style persist as you try different themes, so personalization doesn’t mean starting over.\nReady to dive deeper? Learn more about personalization and Visual Studio’s all-new UX in this companion video.\nTry it and tell us what you think\nReady to try out the new look, AI capabilities, and faster performance in Visual Studio 2026? You can install it alongside your current version, so it’s easy to explore what’s new without disrupting your current setup.\nLet us know what you think and share any problems or suggestions via Developer Community Feedback.\nThe post A first look at the all‑new UX in Visual Studio 2026 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Faster responses, a lower chance of rate limiting, and 10% off premium requests for paid users – auto picks the best available model for each request based on current capacity and performance. With auto, you don’t need to choose a specific model. Copilot automatically selects the best one for your task. Auto model selection in Chat is rolling out in preview to all GitHub Copilot users.\nHow auto model selection works\nAuto selects the best model to ensure that you get the optimal performance and reduce the likelihood of rate limits. Auto will choose between GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, GPT-4.1, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5 and other models, unless your organization has disabled access to these models. Once auto picks a model, it uses that same model for the entire chat session. As we introduce picking models based on task complexity, this behavior will change over the next iterations.\nFor paid users, we currently primarily rely on Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the model powering auto.\n\nWhen using auto model selection, Visual Studio uses a variable model multiplier based on the automatically selected model. If you are a paid user, auto applies a 10% request discount. For example, if auto selects Sonnet 4.5, it will be counted as 0.9x of a premium request.\nIf you are a paid user and run out of premium requests, auto will always choose a 0x model (for example, GPT-4.1), so you can continue using auto without interruption.\nWhat’s next\nOur long-term vision for auto. We aim to make auto the best model selection for most users and to achieve this, here’s what we plan next:\nDynamically switch between small and large models based on the task – this flexibility ensures that you get the right balance of performance and efficiency, while saving on requests\nAdd more language models to auto\nLet users on a free plan take advantage of the latest models through auto\nImprove the model dropdown to make it more obvious which models and discounts are used\nThanks \nThe post Introducing Copilot auto model selection (preview) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Dear developers,\nWe’re thrilled to announce that Visual Studio 2026 is now generally available! This is a moment we’ve built side by side with you. Your feedback has helped shape this release more than any before. Since the introduction of the Insiders Channel in September, more developers have downloaded and tested this preview than any other in Visual Studio’s history.\nIn the year leading up to this release, we fixed over 5,000 of your reported bugs and implemented 300 feature requests. That’s the most we’ve ever done, and we’re just getting started!\nWith several performance improvements, a redesigned user experience, and a major leap in AI-driven development, this release is built to help developers focus on what truly matters: creating. Every click, keystroke, and compile is now smoother, faster, and more intuitive – empowering you to turn ideas into code at unprecedented speed.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026\n\nYou know that sinking feeling when lag interrupts your flow? We’ve worked hard to make that a thing of the past. Blazing-fast performance means startup is significantly snappier, and the UI responds so smoothly you’ll barely notice it’s there, cutting hangs by over 50% and giving the IDE a lightweight, effortless vibe, even on massive projects. Whether you’re wrangling enterprise-scale repos or tinkering on smaller codebases, this sets a new bar for getting stuff done.\nFigure 1: Shows large .NET solution load time to interactive is faster than in VS 2022\nBut it’s not just about loading solutions faster. The UI stays more responsive while things are loading too. In fact, those annoying UI freezes have been cut by more than half.\nFigure 2: Shows the amount of time the UI is unresponsive is less than half of VS 2022 on large solution loads\nStats are cool, but what really matters is how it actually feels to use. The IDE just runs way faster, smoother, and more responsive. That’s something you can’t always see in the numbers.\n \n“Wow! I just opened a solution with over 100 projects, and I can’t believe how fast it came up and was ready! Well done, Visual Studio team!”\n– Steve Smith, Principal Software Architect, NimblePros\n \nVisual Studio 2026 is AI-native, making it the world’s first Intelligent Developer Environment (IDE). That doesn’t mean changing how you work. It means giving you intelligence when it matters most. If you’re debugging a tricky issue, profiling performance, or modernizing an application, AI steps in to remove friction and surface insights that help you move faster without disrupting your flow. It’s there to elevate the practices you already trust, not replace them.\nThis release also brings new C# and C++ agents, designed for professional developers who need precision and speed every day. These capabilities extend what you can do without adding complexity, so you stay in control while accomplishing more in less time. Visual Studio 2026 isn’t AI for the sake of AI, but a natural evolution of the tools you rely on to get the job done while boosting your productivity.\n \n\n \nThis evolution opens doors to possibilities that once felt out of reach, weaving AI naturally into your daily flow. GitHub Copilot has quickly become one of the most used features in Visual Studio, earning praise from developers who rely on it every day.\n \n“The Profiler Agent in Visual Studio immediately highlighted the bottlenecks and guided me to faster, cleaner performance – like having a built-in performance coach.”\n– Roberto Perez, Senior Global Solutions Architect, Redis\n \nWhen you’re using Visual Studio all day long, every interaction matters. We’ve doubled down on perfecting the essentials – removing friction, fixing those subtle “paper cuts,” and refining the flow of your work. This release introduces a flexible new settings system, a beautifully modern UI redesign, and hundreds of under-the-hood improvements that make the IDE feel better in every way.\nFigure 3: The amount of feedback tickets implemented by the Visual Studio team in the past 12 months\nOver the past 12 months, your feedback has helped us fix more than 5,000 bugs and added over 300 feature requests. Our biggest push leading up to a major Visual Studio release yet, and the momentum is still growing. With AI-driven tools accelerating how we identify and resolve issues, we’re delivering improvements faster than ever before.\n \n“What I love most about Visual Studio 2026 is the performance and the fresh and crisp UI – and support for Mermaid diagrams is the icing on the cake.”\n– Erik Ejlskov Jensen, Context& A/S\n \nHere’s the best part: Visual Studio 2026 is fully compatible with your projects and extensions from Visual Studio 2022. Open your existing solutions and start coding immediately. No migration steps, no surprises. All your favorite extensions are available too, so your workspace, tools, and projects transition seamlessly, making the IDE feel like home from the very first launch.\nThe over 4,000 extensions that works with Visual Studio 2022 today, all work with Visual Studio 2026 too. You can upgrade with peace of mind, and your setup will feel just as stable and familiar as ever.\n \n“Getting the extensions from Visual Studio 2022 was a definitive plus: I was ready to use VS 2026 immediately”\n– Didier Donner, Principal Software Engineer, Aspen Technology\n \nPlus, with GitHub Copilot app modernization, upgrades to .NET 10 and the latest C++ build tools are accelerated and guided with expertise, so you’re ready to take full advantage of all the latest performance enhancements and features. GitHub Copilot’s new C++ capabilities are available now in Private Preview.\nFor a long time, updating Visual Studio meant you also had to upgrade your .NET and C++ build tools, since those were tightly linked to the IDE. That often made things tricky, because you’d want the latest features and bug fixes, but the update could mess with your existing projects or force you into toolchain changes you weren’t ready for.\nVisual Studio 2026 changes all that. Now the IDE is decoupled from its build tools, so you can update Visual Studio itself any time you want without affecting your .NET or C++ compilers. Even better, you’ll get automatic monthly updates with fresh features, design tweaks, and productivity boosts delivered right to your IDE, while keeping your toolchains stable for as long as you need.\nIf you like to try out new features before everyone else, the Insiders Channel is for you. It receives frequent updates and allows you to evaluate the newest features without impacting your primary setup, as it can be installed alongside the Stable version. Many people already use it to stay up to date. Join the Insiders Channel to always have the newest features first.\nCurious about what else to find in this new version? Check out the Release Notes for the full scoop.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026 now and swing by the Visual Studio Developer Community to share what’s working, what you’re creating, or where we can step it up. We’re listening.\nWhat to expect next\nIf you’re a Visual Studio subscriber, simply sign in to Visual Studio 2026 and your license will activate automatically.\nSubscribers who use product keys can retrieve them anytime at my.visualstudio.com.\nFor developers who want to purchase a stand-alone Professional license, Visual Studio 2026 will be available through the Microsoft Store starting December 1, 2025.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026\n\nHuge thanks to our Insiders and MVPs for making this release something special. Let’s keep building the future of coding together.\nWith gratitude,\nThe Visual Studio Team\nThe post Visual Studio 2026 is here: faster, smarter, and a hit with early adopters appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'아, 이건 HTML 파일이네!' 하고 다 파악한 후 최적화된 설정을 보여주니, 우리는 그저 'Deploy' 버튼만 클릭하면 끝! 정말 쉽죠?\n잠시 후 '축하합니다!' 메시지와 함께 미리보기 화면이 나타나면, 정상적으로 배포(Deploy)가 완료된 겁니다. 화면 아래 버튼을 클릭하여 대시보드로 이동하세요.\n'Production Deployment' 화면에서 'Domains' 섹션을 보면 방금 배포가 완료된 우리 앱(웹페이지)의 주소가 보입니다. 이 주소를 공유하면 다른 사람들이 바로 접속해서 사용할 수 있어요.\n  팁: 버셀과 깃허브를 처음 연결할 때만 이런 복잡한(?) 과정이 필요하고, 그다음부터는 버셀 대시보드에서 우측 상단의 'Visit'를 클릭해 프로젝트를 선택하는 것으로 간단하게 관리할 수 있어요.\nCI/CD: 지속적인 통합과 배포의 마법\n그럼 배포한 앱에 수정사항이 발생하면 앞서 알려드린 연결에서 배포까지의 모든 과정을 다시 거쳐야 할까요? 물론 아니죠! 여기서 깃허브와 버셀 연동의 진짜 마법이 펼쳐집니다.\n이제 깃허브는 우리가 코드를 수정할 때마다 버셀에게 “방금 코드를 수정했어요!”라고 자동으로 알려줍니다. 그러면 버셀이 알아서 새로운 버전으로 다시 배포를 시작하고요. 이걸 바로 개발자들이 말하는 CI(Continuous Integration)/CD(Continuous Delivery), 즉 지속적 통합과 지속적 배포라고 해요. 제가 직접 테스트해 보니 정말 신기하고 편했어요. 한 번 예시를 통해 볼까요?\n깃허브에서 앞서 배포한 HTML 파일의 제목을 \"유용한 에이아이 도구 모음\"으로 수정합니다.\n'Commit changes'의 변경사항을 '제목 수정'이라고 입력하고 저장합니다.\n그러면 버셀로 이동해서 보면, 수정된 내용이 반영되어 자동으로 재배포가 진행되고, 실제 실행을 해보면 변경사항이 제대로 적용된 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 정말 편리하지 않나요?\n⚙️ AI Studio 앱 배포: API 유무에 따른 전략\n이제 단순 HTML 파일이 아닌, AI Studio 빌드에서 작업한 실제 AI 앱을 깃허브에 업로드하고 버셀로 배포하는 방법을 알려드릴게요. 이때 중요한 건, 앱이 API를 사용하는지 여부에 따라 접근 방식이 조금 달라진다는 점이에요.\nAI Studio 앱 깃허브 업로드\nAI Studio에서 만든 앱을 깃허브에 올리는 과정은 놀랍도록 간편합니다.\n먼저 AI Studio 빌드 채팅창에서 여러분이 만들었던 앱을 띄워놓습니다. 예를 들어, 휴대폰 배경화면을 생성하는 모바일 전용 한글 웹 앱을 만들어 달라고 요청했던 앱이 될 수 있겠죠.\n우측 상단의 깃허브 아이콘('GitHub에 저장' 버튼)을 클릭하고 '깃허브에 로그인하여 계속하기'를 클릭합니다.\n팝업창에서 아래로 스크롤하여 '설치 및 승인' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n저장소 이름과 설명을 입력하고 'Public'을 선택한 후 'Create Git Repo'를 클릭합니다.\n다음 화면에 업로드할 파일 목록이 보일 거예요. 화면 아래 'Stage and commit all changes' 버튼을 클릭하면 깃허브로 업로드하는 과정이 완료됩니다.\n버셀을 통한 AI Studio 앱 배포 (API 유무)\n이제 깃허브에 올라간 AI Studio 앱을 버셀로 배포해봅시다. 여기서 중요한 차이점을 발견할 수 있을 거예요.\n버셀로 가서 우측 상단에 'Visit'를 클릭해서 프로젝트를 선택한 후, 조금 전에 업로드한 깃허브 프로젝트를 'Import'하면 됩니다.\n우리가 앞서 배포한 건 단순한 HTML 파일이라 `index.html` 파일명이 중요했어요. 하지만 지금 배포한 AI 앱은, 버셀이 '이건 React 기반 앱이구나!' 하고 자동으로 인식합니다. 그래서 파일명 같은 것을 전혀 신경 쓸 필요 없이 'Import'와 'Deploy' 버튼만 누르면 배포가 완료돼요. 정말 똑똑하죠!\n이런 식으로 경주마 레이싱 게임 'Gee Wiz' 같은 AI를 사용하지 않는 (즉, API가 필요 없는) 앱은 에러 없이 제대로 배포되고 발행된 주소를 통해서도 잘 접속되며 정상 작동하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 저도 배포하고 나서 바로 게임을 플레이해봤는데 정말 만족스러웠어요.\n⚠️ 주의: 그런데 사실, 제미나이 API를 사용하는 첫 번째 앱은 배포 과정에서 문제는 없었지만 실행하면 아무 화면도 보이지 않았을 거예요. 왜냐하면 제미나이 API를 사용하고 있기 때문입니다. 물론 버셀에서 프로젝트를 세팅할 때 API 키를 등록할 수도 있지만, 이렇게 배포하게 되면 여러분의 API를 다른 사람들이 무단으로 사용하게 되어 보안이나 예상치 못한 비용 발생의 문제가 생길 수 있어요. 이 점은 정말 중요합니다!\n  API 키 보안: 사용자에게 키 관리 맡기기\n결국, 앱은 여러분이 만들어 배포하고 API는 사용자들의 것으로 사용하게 해야겠죠. 이게 가장 이상적인 방법입니다. 그래야 여러분의 API 키가 안전하게 보호되고 불필요한 비용 발생을 막을 수 있어요. 이제 AI Studio 앱을 수정하여 사용자 로컬 드라이브에 API 키를 암호화하여 저장하고 테스트하는 기능을 추가해볼게요.\nAI Studio 앱 수정: 외장형 API 키 관리로 전환\nAI Studio 빌드의 강력한 기능을 활용해 앱에 외장형 API 키 관리 기능을 추가해봅시다.\nAI Studio 빌드에서 첫 번째 앱(모바일 배경화면 생성기)을 다시 불러옵니다.\n채팅창에 \"API key 관리를 내장형이 아닌 외장형으로 변경해야 해. 버튼을 클릭하면 이 앱에 사용된 모든 API 키를 사용자 로컬 드라이브에 암호화해서 저장하고, 연결 테스트를 하는 팝업창을 생성해\"라고 요청합니다.\n요청이 완료되면, 완성된 앱에는 API 키를 입력하고 연결 테스트 한 후 저장하는 기능이 추가된 것을 확인할 수 있을 거예요. 이러면 앱 개발자도 내장된 API가 아닌, API 키를 발급받아 사용하게 됩니다.\n기능이 추가되었으니, 수정된 소스를 깃허브에 다시 업로드하는 것을 잊지 마세요!\nGoogle Cloud에서 API 키 발급받기\n이제 사용자에게 제공할 API 키를 Google Cloud에서 발급받는 방법을 알아볼게요. 이 키를 통해 사용자가 직접 자신의 환경에서 AI 모델을 활용할 수 있게 됩니다.\nGoogle Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)에 접속합니다.\n'프로젝트 만들기 또는 선택' 버튼을 클릭합니다. 이미 다른 프로젝트가 있다면, 화면처럼 순서대로 클릭해서 새 프로젝트를 만들 수 있어요.\n새 프로젝트에서 '프로젝트 명'을 입력하고 '만들기'를 클릭합니다.\n프로젝트가 제대로 생성이 되었는지 좌측 상단의 프로젝트 버튼을 클릭, 방금 생성된 프로젝트 명을 선택한 후 계정이 활성화된 것을 확인하세요.\n다시 AI Studio 빌드로 가서 우측 상단에 'Switch to API key' 아이콘을 클릭합니다.\n그다음 'Create a new key'를 선택하고 '프로젝트 가져오기'에서 좀 전에 만든 프로젝트를 체크하고 가져오기 합니다.\n가져온 프로젝트를 선택한 후, 키 이름을 입력하고 '키 만들기'를 클릭하세요. 이러면 API 키가 만들어지긴 하지만, 키 값을 바로 확인할 수는 없습니다.\n키 값을 얻기 위해 AI Studio 첫 화면에서 좌측 하단에 'Get API key'를 선택하면 보이는 프로젝트 목록 우측에, 복사 아이콘을 클릭하면 키 값이 복사됩니다. 이제 이 키를 여러분의 앱 사용자에게 제공할 수 있습니다.\nAPI 키 테스트 및 최종 확인\n발급받은 API 키가 제대로 작동하는지 확인하는 과정도 중요해요. 저는 제 스마트폰에서도 직접 확인해봤는데, 정말 뿌듯했어요.\n다시 앱으로 돌아와 우측 상단의 키 관리 창을 열고 방금 복사한 키 값을 넣고 '연결 테스트'를 합니다. 문제가 없다면 성공!\n마지막으로 버셀에서 배포된 앱의 주소로 가서 API 키 값을 테스트해도 아무런 문제가 없음을 확인합니다. 제 스마트폰에서도 완벽하게 동작하는 것을 확인했습니다. 이제 여러분의 AI 앱은 완벽한 독립 웹사이트로 전 세계에 서비스될 준비를 마친 겁니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1. GitHub는 코드와 파일을 안전하게 관리하고 협업하는 온라인 저장소입니다.\n2. Vercel은 GitHub와 연동하여 웹 앱을 전 세계에 무료로 배포할 수 있는 강력한 플랫폼입니다.\n3. AI 앱 배포 시, `index.html` 파일명과 CI/CD 자동 배포 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다.\n4. API 키 보안을 위해 AI Studio 앱을 수정하여 사용자가 직접 API 키를 관리하도록 설정해야 합니다.\n이 네 가지 핵심 사항만 잘 이해하고 적용한다면, 여러분도 2025년 최고의 AI 앱 개발자로 거듭날 수 있습니다!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 코딩을 전혀 몰라도 정말 AI 앱을 배포할 수 있나요?\n네, 물론입니다! AI Studio 빌드에서 앱을 만들고, GitHub와 Vercel은 직관적인 인터페이스를 제공하기 때문에 코딩 지식이 없어도 충분히 배포할 수 있습니다. 오늘 배운 가이드라인을 따라하면 누구든 가능해요.\nQ2: Vercel의 무료 요금제(Hobby 플랜)는 어느 정도까지 사용할 수 있나요?\nVercel의 Hobby 플랜은 개인 프로젝트 및 비상업적 용도에 매우 관대한 한도를 제공합니다. 월별 빌드 시간, 대역폭, 함수 실행 등 대부분의 개인 개발자가 충분히 사용할 수 있는 수준이에요. 신용카드 등록 없이 시작할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.\nQ3: AI Studio 앱의 API 키 보안이 왜 그렇게 중요한가요?\nAPI 키는 여러분의 계정과 연결되어 AI 모델 사용에 대한 비용이 발생할 수 있습니다. 만약 키가 노출되면 다른 사람이 무단으로 사용해 예상치 못한 과금이 발생하거나, 여러분의 API 사용 한도가 소진될 수 있기 때문에 철저한 보안이 필수적입니다. 사용자가 직접 키를 관리하게 하는 것이 가장 안전한 방법입니다.\n오늘 강의 내용을 다시 한번 정리해드리면서 마무리할까 합니다. 여러분은 오늘 AI Studio 빌드에서 만든 앱을 깃허브에 저장하고, 버셀을 통해 누구나 접속할 수 있는 실제 웹사이트로 배포하는 전 과정을 배우셨습니다. 정말 많은 것을 해내신 거예요!\n이 방법을 통해, 이제 여러분은 구글 로그인이나 소스 코드 노출 걱정 없이 안전하게 자신의 AI 앱을 공유할 수 있게 되었습니다. 특히 중요한 점은, 제미나이 API를 사용하는 앱의 경우, 여러분의 API 키를 보호하기 위해 반드시 '외장형'으로 관리 방식을 변경해야 한다는 것이었죠. 사용자가 직접 자신의 API 키를 입력하게 만들어, 보안과 비용 문제를 모두 현명하게 해결했습니다.\n  이 기사에서 사용된 2개의 앱 무료링크\n  AI 모바일 배경화면 생성기 \n공유용 : https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1tuSsk3Vc1ZNMDPwjzLZh_PYoKHQmrig1\n배포용 : https://mobile-wallpaper-generator.vercel.app/\n  GEE WIZ 경마게임 \n공유용 :  https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1whAHjrX-Wg7n4jWwjZZ3rVbGMsyU3nVz\n배포용 :  https://gee-wiz.vercel.app/",

        "contentSnippet": "특허 정보의 새로운 지평을 여는 획기적인 소식을 들고 왔습니다. 인공지능이 특허 검색의 오랜 장벽을 허물고 모두에게 IP 지식을 선사하는 시대, 바로 퍼플렉시티 특허가 그 시작을 알렸습니다. 과거의 복잡했던 특허 검색은 잊으세요. 이제 자연어 질문만으로도 혁신의 속도에 발맞춘 지식을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n✨ 2025년, AI 특허 시대의 서막: 퍼플렉시티 특허를 소개합니다\n\n\n 퍼플렉시티 팀은 전 세계에 획기적인 발표를 했습니다. 바로 퍼플렉시티 특허(Perplexity Patents)의 출시인데요. 제 생각에 이 서비스는 ‘AI 특허 연구 에이전트’라는 이름이 딱 어울리는, 정말 놀라운 기술이라고 할 수 있어요. 이전까지 특허 정보는 사실 전문가들만의 영역처럼 느껴졌잖아요? 복잡한 검색 시스템, 비싼 전문 플랫폼, 그리고 알 수 없는 구문들… 저 같은 일반인이나 심지어 숙련되지 않은 연구자들에게는 넘기 어려운 장벽이었죠.\n하지만 퍼플렉시티 특허는 이 모든 것을 바꿀 준비가 되어있습니다. 이제 누구나 특허 지능에 접근하고, 여러 질문에 걸쳐 맥락을 유지하면서 빠르고 명확한 답변을 얻을 수 있게 되었어요. 이건 마치 혁신의 속도에 맞춰 지식을 얻을 수 있는 새로운 문이 열린 것과 다름없다고 생각합니다.\n  주목할 점: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 인류의 호기심과 독창성이 실제 혁신으로 이어지는 과정에서 발생한 '특허'라는 지적 유물을, 모두가 접근할 수 있는 지식의 보고로 탈바꿈시키고 있습니다. 지식의 순환을 가속화하는 핵심적인 역할을 할 것으로 기대돼요.\n ️ 자연어와 특허 지능의 만남: 대화형 검색의 혁명\n퍼플렉시티 특허의 가장 큰 매력 중 하나는 바로 자연어 검색 기능입니다. 기존에는 복잡한 키워드 조합이나 전문적인 검색 구문을 익혀야만 원하는 특허를 찾을 수 있었죠. 그런데 퍼플렉시티는 달라요. 마치 친구에게 질문하듯이 편하게 물어보면 됩니다.\n“언어 학습을 위한 AI 관련 특허가 있을까?”\n“2024년 이후 주요 양자 컴퓨팅 특허는?”\n\n\n이런 식으로 질문하면 퍼플렉시티가 자동으로 특허 관련 쿼리를 이해하고, 관련 특허 컬렉션을 제공해줍니다. 게다가 인라인 뷰어와 원본 문서로의 직접 링크까지 제공하니, 제가 굳이 이리저리 찾아다닐 필요가 없는 거죠. 정말 편리하지 않나요?\n저는 이 ‘인용 중심(citation-first)’ 접근 방식이 특허 검색의 판도를 완전히 바꿀 거라고 확신해요. 권위 있는 출처와 AI 기반 지능의 이런 매끄러운 통합은 특허 연구를 그야말로 즐겁고 손쉬운 일로 만들어줍니다. 이건 단순히 검색이 아니라, 마치 전문가와 대화하는 것 같은 경험이에요.\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 아무리 자연어 검색이 편리하다 해도, 특정 용어나 기술에 대한 정확한 정보를 얻고 싶을 때는 핵심 키워드를 포함하는 것이 더 효율적인 결과를 가져올 수 있습니다. AI는 문맥을 이해하지만, 사용자의 의도를 명확히 전달하는 것은 중요합니다.\n\n\n더 깊이 파고들고 싶거나, 다른 발명품들을 비교하고 싶을 때도 걱정 없습니다. 후속 질문을 던지면 되니까요. 처음부터 다시 시작할 필요 없이, 퍼플렉시티는 관련 후속 주제까지 제안해주면서 새로운 연구 방향을 탐색하고 지식을 확장하는 데 도움을 줍니다. 솔직히 말하면, 제가 겪어본 바로는 이런 대화형 검색은 특허 연구의 생산성을 정말 엄청나게 끌어올려 줍니다.\n⚙️ 실제 특허 업무를 위한 설계: 숨겨진 선행 기술까지 찾아내다\n퍼플렉시티 특허는 단순히 키워드를 일치시키는 것을 넘어섭니다. 예를 들어, ‘피트니스 트래커’를 검색하면 기존 도구들은 그 정확한 용어가 포함된 특허만 보여주기 일쑤였죠. 하지만 퍼플렉시티 특허는 ‘활동 밴드’, ‘걸음 수 측정 시계’, ‘건강 모니터링 웨어러블’과 같이 다른 용어를 사용했더라도 중요한 발명품을 찾아냅니다.\n이게 가능한 이유는 바로 최첨단 에이전트 기반 연구 시스템(state-of-the-art agentic research system) 덕분입니다. AI 연구 에이전트가 복잡한 쿼리를 구체적인 정보 검색 작업으로 세분화하고, 이를 자체 엑사바이트(exabyte) 규모 검색 인프라에 호스팅된 특수 특허 지식 인덱스를 사용해 실행합니다. 그 결과는 에이전트가 후속 연구를 안내하고, 수십에서 수백 개의 보조 문서로 질문에 답변하는 데 사용됩니다.\n결국 사용자 입장에선 더 이상 정확한 키워드를 입력하거나 복잡한 절차를 거칠 필요가 없다는 거죠. 퍼플렉시티 특허는 고급 AI를 사용하여 실시간으로 실제 답변을 제공하며, 심지어 제가 미처 생각하지 못했을 질문에 대한 답까지 찾아줍니다. 이 부분은 정말 대단하다고 생각해요. 특허 전문 변리사님들도 이 기능에 감탄할 것 같습니다.\n\n\n  전통적인 특허 데이터베이스를 넘어서: 전체 혁신 생태계를 탐색하다\n엔지니어, 연구원, 특허 실무자, 그리고 비즈니스 리더들은 모두 알 겁니다. 실제 혁신은 하나의 정해진 틀 안에 깔끔하게 들어맞지 않는다는 것을요. 요즘 선행 기술은 블로그, 비디오, 심지어 컴퓨터 코드와 같이 점점 더 다양하고 비전통적인 형태로 나타나고 있어요.\n퍼플렉시티 특허의 진정한 강점은 바로 여기에 있습니다. 단순히 특허 문헌만 검색하는 데 그치지 않는다는 점이죠. 필요하다면 학술 논문, 공개 소프트웨어 저장소, 그리고 새로운 아이디어와 돌파구가 처음 나타나는 다른 출처까지 탐색합니다. 저는 이런 광범위한 접근 방식이 정말 중요하다고 봐요. 왜냐하면 혁신의 초기 단계 정보는 특허 출원보다 훨씬 먼저 블로그나 학술지에 등장하는 경우가 많기 때문이죠.\n이것은 곧 우리가 트렌드를 포착하고, 관련 기술을 발견하며, 혁신의 전체적인 그림을 볼 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 경쟁사 분석이나 새로운 시장 기회를 탐색하는 비즈니스 리더들에게는 정말 귀중한 도구가 될 거예요. 저도 개인적으로 신기술 동향을 파악할 때 이 기능을 유용하게 사용할 것 같습니다.\n\n\n  퍼플렉시티 특허, 이제 당신의 손안에! (베타 출시)\n퍼플렉시티는 퍼플렉시티 특허를 오늘부터 전 세계적으로 베타(beta) 제품으로 출시했습니다. 가장 좋은 소식은, 베타 기간 동안 모든 사용자에게 무료로 제공된다는 점입니다! (정말 놀랍지 않나요?)\nPro 및 Max 구독자는 추가 사용량 할당 및 모델 구성 옵션을 받게 됩니다. 저는 일반 사용자도 무료로 이 강력한 도구를 경험할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적이라고 생각합니다. 일단 특허 관련 질문으로 시작해보세요. 퍼플렉시티가 전 세계의 특허 지능을 여러분의 손끝으로 가져다줄 겁니다.\n  핵심 요약\n1. AI 특허 시대 개막: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 AI를 활용해 복잡했던 특허 검색을 대중화합니다.\n2. 자연어 대화형 검색: 키워드 대신 일반적인 질문으로 특허 정보를 얻고, 후속 질문으로 깊이 탐색할 수 있습니다.\n3. 강력한 선행 기술 탐색: 유연한 검색으로 숨겨진 관련 특허 및 비전통적인 선행 기술까지 찾아냅니다.\n4. 혁신 생태계 전체 분석: 특허 문헌 외 학술지, 코드 등 다양한 출처를 탐색해 전체적인 트렌드를 파악할 수 있습니다.\n이제 여러분도 IP 정보의 바다를 헤치고 혁신적인 아이디어를 발굴할 수 있습니다. 이 기회를 놓치지 마세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 기존 특허 검색 엔진과 무엇이 다른가요?\nA1: 기존 검색 엔진은 정확한 키워드와 복잡한 구문이 필요했지만, 퍼플렉시티 특허는 자연어 질문으로도 관련 특허를 찾아줍니다.

EM 크기는 상대적 단위의 크기로 일반적으로 1000 또는 2048 단위로 설정됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n좌표 공간을 지정했으면 폰트 메트릭을 결정할 차례입니다. 폰트 메트릭은 **폰트 모양이 좌표 내에 어디에 표시될지**를 결정하는 아주 중요한 지표입니다. 메트릭이 없으면 글자가 좌표 공간 내에서 멋대로 배치되어 글자가 삐뚤빼뚤하게 표시될 수 있습니다. 아래는 주요 폰트 메트릭에 대한 설명과 이해를 돕기 위한 그림입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text2.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n| 요소           | 설명                                                                                                        |\r\r\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\r\n| **EM Square**  | 글꼴의 모든 문자가 설계되는 가상의 좌표 공간<br>모든 글자는 이 가상의 정사각형 안에서 상대 좌표로 설계된다. |\r\r\n| **Baseline**   | 글자가 놓이는 기준 선                                                                                       |\r\r\n| **x-height**   | 소문자 ‘x’의 높이(소문자 기준 높이)                                                                        |\r\r\n| **Cap height** | 대문자 기준 높이(‘M’, ‘H’ 등)                                                                              |\r\r\n| **Ascender**   | ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘k’처럼 위로 튀어나온 부분의 최대 높이                                                            |\r\r\n| **Descender**  | ‘g’, ‘p’, ‘y’처럼 아래로 내려가는 부분의 깊이                                                               |\r\r\n\r\r\n즉, 폰트의 모든 글자는 Baseline을 기준으로 Descender 만큼 아래로 나타날 수 있고, Ascender 만큼 위로 나타날 수 있습니다. 또한 EM 크기는 기준이 되는 상대적 단위의 크기이므로 Ascender와 Descender의 합이 EM 크기보다 작거나 클 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 폰트 메트릭까지 설정했으니, 폰트의 각 글자의 모양만 만들면 폰트가 만들어집니다. 아래는 예제에서 사용한 폰트 Pretendard의 메트릭 정보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 그래서 폰트 크기는 어떻게 결정되는데?\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 우리가 `font-size`로 설정한 값이 실제 폰트 크기로 설정되지 않는 이유 중 하나는 `font-size`가 이렇게 나타나도록 만들어져 있기 때문이라고 했습니다. 이에 대해 결론부터 말하자면 `font-size`는 폰트의 문자 그 자체의 높이가 아닌 **폰트의 `em-square`의 크기를 결정**짓는 속성입니다.[<sup></sup>](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 Pretendard 폰트가 `font-size`값에 따라 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지 알아봅시다. Pretendard 폰트는 2048 단위의 EM 크기에서 1949(Ascender)+494(Descender) 단위를 사용합니다. 이는 EM 크기가 `2048px`로 결정되면 폰트의 크기는 `2443(=1949+494)px`이 된다는 의미입니다.[<sup></sup>](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-253&utm_medium=web)\r\r\n\r\r\n그러면 예제의 높이를 계산해 볼까요? `font-size: 50px`이라는 뜻은 EM 크기가 `50px`로 결정되었다는 뜻이고, 이에 따라 폰트의 크기는 `59.5(≈ 2443 / 2048 * 50)px`(2x 스케일링으로 `0.5px`까지 표현 가능)로 계산됩니다. 이 값은 예제가 갖는 값과 동일하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 우리는 메트릭 정보와 `font-size`를 이용해 실제로 폰트가 몇 픽셀로 나타날지 계산할 수 있습니다!\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n폰트 크기 = (${Ascender} + ${Descender}) / ${EM 크기} \\* ${font-size}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 내가 궁금한 건 폰트가 왜 치우치냐예요.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 폰트가 왜 치우쳐 나타나는지 알기 위해 폰트의 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지를 알아봤습니다. 폰트가 치우치는 것은 이렇게 결정된 폰트 크기 내에 문자가 어떻게 배치되는지에 따라 결정되는 것입니다. 우리는 폰트 메트릭에서 문자가 놓일 기준선과 문자의 기준 높이, 그리고 위/아래 최대 높이를 알 수 있었습니다. 이를 활용하면 문자가 위/아래에 얼마 만큼의 여백을 두고 나타날지(수직으로 어디에 정렬될지) 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 글자의 높이와 여백을 쉽게 측정하기 위해 예제의 `font-size`를 `51px`로 조정해서 폰트의 크기가 정수(`61px`)로 결정되도록 조정하겠습니다.[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/OPVPqax)\r\r\n\r\r\n![text4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text4.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 대문자 M의 크기와 위/아래 여백의 크기를 계산해 봅시다. 앞서 수식에서 `(${Ascender} + ${Descender})`을 계산하고자 하는 메트릭 값으로 치환하면 원하는 계산 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈ ${Cap height} / ${EM 크기} * ${font-size}\r\r\n1448 / 2048 * 51 =

그림에 따라 세 브라우저 모두 환경 무관하게 폰트 크기가 `61px`, 대문자 M의 크기는 1x 환경에서 `37px`, 2x 환경에서 `36.5px`로 동일하게 계산된 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 브라우저마다 각 환경에 따른 위/아래 여백 계산 결과에 차이를 보여 동일한 폰트에 동일한 문자라 할지라도 환경에 따라 텍스트가 시각적으로 중앙에 정렬되어 보일 수도, 그렇지 않을 수도 있음을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이번 예제는 그래도 폰트의 크기도, 대문자 M의 크기도 홀수로 계산되고 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 짝수여서 어떻게든 중앙에 나타날 수 있는 형태였습니다. 하지만, 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 홀수라면 어떻게 될까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n이번에는 `font-size`를 `11px`로 설정해서 폰트 크기는 홀수(`13px`), 대문자 M의 크기는 짝수(`8px`)로 나타내 보도록 하겠습니다.[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/azOOKEE) 먼저, 변경된 값과 폰트 메트릭에 따른 크기를 다시 계산해 봅시다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈

있어서 중앙 정렬이 잘 되어 보이지만, 1x 환경에서는 픽셀을 반으로 나누는 게 불가능해 한 쪽으로 `1px` 치우쳐 보일 수밖에 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 확인한 바와 같이 텍스트는 텍스트를 보는 환경에 따라 폰트 크기 내에서 수직 중앙 정렬이 될 수도, 아닐 수도 있다는 사실을 알았습니다. 다양한 CSS 수직 정렬 속성(`vertical-align`, `align-items`, `justify-content` 등)은 폰트 크기 내 텍스트를 정렬하는 것이 아니고 일정한 기준에 따라 폰트 자체의 위치를 조정하는 것으로 앞서 설명 드렸던 **치우쳐 보이는 이유**에서 벗어날 수 없습니다. 따라서 이것이 진정 수직 중앙 정렬한 텍스트가 치우쳐 보이는 이유입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n텍스트는 환경에 따라 정렬되어 보인다는 점이 다르다 해도 작게는 0.5px에서 크게는 2px 정도 치우쳐 보이게 됩니다. 이 정도 차이가 일반적으로 큰 문제를 일으키지는 않지만, 이 차이가 굉장히 중요한 문제를 일으키는 때가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없는 것 일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n꼭 그렇지만은 않습니다. **보편적인 환경에 대해 모든 문제를 해결하는 것은 어렵지만, 필요한 때에 필요한 곳에서는 제한적으로 대응할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### **실용적인 대응 방법**\r\r\n\r\r\n1. **CSS transform 활용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/OPVVwgR?editors=1100)\r\r\n   텍스트가 시각적으로 정확히 중앙에 보이도록 미세하게 조정이 필요한 경우 `transform` 속성을 사용하여 텍스트 위치를 조정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .vertically-centered-text {\r\r\n   display: flex;\r\r\n   align-items: center;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-0.5px); /_ 상황에 따라 값 조정 _/\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n2. **폰트별 보정 값 적용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/WbvvKzZ?editors=1400)\r\r\n   특정 폰트와 크기에서 반복적으로 발생하는 정렬 문제가 있다면, 해당 조합에 대한 보정 값을 미리 계산하여 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .apple-sd-gothic-neo {\r\r\n   font-family: 'Apple SD Gothic Neo';\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   .segoe-ui {\r\r\n   font-family: SegoeUI;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-3px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n3. **텍스트 대신 아이콘이나 SVG 사용하기**\r\r\n   정확한 수직 정렬이 매우 중요한 UI 요소(예: 버튼의 아이콘)의 경우, 텍스트 대신 SVG나 아이콘 폰트를 사용하면 더 정확한 배치가 가능합니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n4. **텍스트 박스에 패딩/마진 추가하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/pvJJZQK?editors=1400%3C/sup%3E)\r\r\n   텍스트를 담은 요소에 적절한 패딩/마진을 추가하면 미세한 정렬 차이를 눈에 덜 띄게 할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   /_ margin을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-margin {\r\r\n   margin-top: -3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   /_ padding을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-padding {\r\r\n   padding-bottom: 3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n5. **브라우저 환경 감지 및 조건부 스타일 적용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/EajjpJB)\r\r\n   특정 브라우저나 픽셀 밀도에 따라 다른 보정 값을 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```js\r\r\n   // 브라우저와 픽셀 밀도에 따른 보정 클래스 추가\r\r\n   const element = document.querySelector('.text');\r\r\n\r\r\n   if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Chrome')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('chrome-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Safari')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('safari-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Firefox')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('firefox-adjustment');\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   element.classList.add(`pixelratio-${window.devicePixelRatio}x-adjustment`);\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n

translateY(-2px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 결론\r\r\n\r\r\n폰트는 디자인적인 이유와 기술적인 제약으로 인해 완벽하게 수직 중앙 정렬되어 보이지 않을 수 있습니다. 이는 폰트 메트릭의 특성, 브라우저의 렌더링 방식, 픽셀 밀도 등 여러 요인이 복합적으로 작용한 결과입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n완벽한 수직 중앙 정렬을 위한 마법 같은 해결책은 없지만, 폰트의 동작 방식을 이해하고 특정 상황에 맞는 보정을 적용한다면 시각적으로 더 만족스러운 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n무엇보다 중요한 것은 이러한 차이가 '오류'가 아니라 폰트와 텍스트 렌더링의 본질적인 특성임을 이해하는 것입니다. 보통의 경우 이 미세한 차이는 사용자 경험에 큰 영향을 주지 않으므로, 지나친 완벽주의보다는 전체적인 디자인 일관성과 사용성에 집중하는 것이 바람직합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 NCUI개발팀은 NCUI 컴포넌트 라이브러리를 통해 NHN Cloud 콘솔 구현 시 더 쉽고 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있도록 돕고 있습니다. 이번 글은 그 과정에서 얻은 고민과

EM 크기는 상대적 단위의 크기로 일반적으로 1000 또는 2048 단위로 설정됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n좌표 공간을 지정했으면 폰트 메트릭을 결정할 차례입니다. 폰트 메트릭은 **폰트 모양이 좌표 내에 어디에 표시될지**를 결정하는 아주 중요한 지표입니다. 메트릭이 없으면 글자가 좌표 공간 내에서 멋대로 배치되어 글자가 삐뚤빼뚤하게 표시될 수 있습니다. 아래는 주요 폰트 메트릭에 대한 설명과 이해를 돕기 위한 그림입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text2.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n| 요소           | 설명                                                                                                        |\r\r\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\r\n| **EM Square**  | 글꼴의 모든 문자가 설계되는 가상의 좌표 공간\n모든 글자는 이 가상의 정사각형 안에서 상대 좌표로 설계된다. |\r\r\n| **Baseline**   | 글자가 놓이는 기준 선                                                                                       |\r\r\n| **x-height**   | 소문자 ‘x’의 높이(소문자 기준 높이)                                                                        |\r\r\n| **Cap height** | 대문자 기준 높이(‘M’, ‘H’ 등)                                                                              |\r\r\n| **Ascender**   | ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘k’처럼 위로 튀어나온 부분의 최대 높이                                                            |\r\r\n| **Descender**  | ‘g’, ‘p’, ‘y’처럼 아래로 내려가는 부분의 깊이                                                               |\r\r\n\r\r\n즉, 폰트의 모든 글자는 Baseline을 기준으로 Descender 만큼 아래로 나타날 수 있고, Ascender 만큼 위로 나타날 수 있습니다. 또한 EM 크기는 기준이 되는 상대적 단위의 크기이므로 Ascender와 Descender의 합이 EM 크기보다 작거나 클 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 폰트 메트릭까지 설정했으니, 폰트의 각 글자의 모양만 만들면 폰트가 만들어집니다. 아래는 예제에서 사용한 폰트 Pretendard의 메트릭 정보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그래서 폰트 크기는 어떻게 결정되는데?\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 우리가 `font-size`로 설정한 값이 실제 폰트 크기로 설정되지 않는 이유 중 하나는 `font-size`가 이렇게 나타나도록 만들어져 있기 때문이라고 했습니다. 이에 대해 결론부터 말하자면 `font-size`는 폰트의 문자 그 자체의 높이가 아닌 **폰트의 `em-square`의 크기를 결정**짓는 속성입니다.[](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 Pretendard 폰트가 `font-size`값에 따라 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지 알아봅시다. Pretendard 폰트는 2048 단위의 EM 크기에서 1949(Ascender)+494(Descender) 단위를 사용합니다. 이는 EM 크기가 `2048px`로 결정되면 폰트의 크기는 `2443(=1949+494)px`이 된다는 의미입니다.[](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-253&utm_medium=web)\r\r\n\r\r\n그러면 예제의 높이를 계산해 볼까요? `font-size: 50px`이라는 뜻은 EM 크기가 `50px`로 결정되었다는 뜻이고, 이에 따라 폰트의 크기는 `59.5(≈ 2443 / 2048 * 50)px`(2x 스케일링으로 `0.5px`까지 표현 가능)로 계산됩니다. 이 값은 예제가 갖는 값과 동일하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 우리는 메트릭 정보와 `font-size`를 이용해 실제로 폰트가 몇 픽셀로 나타날지 계산할 수 있습니다!\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n폰트 크기 = (${Ascender} + ${Descender}) / ${EM 크기} \\* ${font-size}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 내가 궁금한 건 폰트가 왜 치우치냐예요.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 폰트가 왜 치우쳐 나타나는지 알기 위해 폰트의 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지를 알아봤습니다. 폰트가 치우치는 것은 이렇게 결정된 폰트 크기 내에 문자가 어떻게 배치되는지에 따라 결정되는 것입니다. 우리는 폰트 메트릭에서 문자가 놓일 기준선과 문자의 기준 높이, 그리고 위/아래 최대 높이를 알 수 있었습니다. 이를 활용하면 문자가 위/아래에 얼마 만큼의 여백을 두고 나타날지(수직으로 어디에 정렬될지) 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 글자의 높이와 여백을 쉽게 측정하기 위해 예제의 `font-size`를 `51px`로 조정해서 폰트의 크기가 정수(`61px`)로 결정되도록 조정하겠습니다.[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/OPVPqax)\r\r\n\r\r\n![text4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text4.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 대문자 M의 크기와 위/아래 여백의 크기를 계산해 봅시다. 앞서 수식에서 `(${Ascender} + ${Descender})`을 계산하고자 하는 메트릭 값으로 치환하면 원하는 계산 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈ ${Cap height} / ${EM 크기} * ${font-size}\r\r\n1448 / 2048 * 51 = 36.05859375(px)\r\r\n//

그림에 따라 세 브라우저 모두 환경 무관하게 폰트 크기가 `61px`, 대문자 M의 크기는 1x 환경에서 `37px`, 2x 환경에서 `36.5px`로 동일하게 계산된 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 브라우저마다 각 환경에 따른 위/아래 여백 계산 결과에 차이를 보여 동일한 폰트에 동일한 문자라 할지라도 환경에 따라 텍스트가 시각적으로 중앙에 정렬되어 보일 수도, 그렇지 않을 수도 있음을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이번 예제는 그래도 폰트의 크기도, 대문자 M의 크기도 홀수로 계산되고 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 짝수여서 어떻게든 중앙에 나타날 수 있는 형태였습니다. 하지만, 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 홀수라면 어떻게 될까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n이번에는 `font-size`를

|\r\r\n\r\r\n대문자 M의 크기가 짝수(`8px`)로 결정됨에 따라 위/아래 여백으로 사용 가능한 크기가 홀수(`5px`)로 결정됩니다. 그러나 2x 환경에서는 `.5px`까지 렌더링할 수 있어서 중앙 정렬이 잘 되어 보이지만, 1x 환경에서는 픽셀을 반으로 나누는 게 불가능해 한 쪽으로 `1px` 치우쳐 보일 수밖에 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 확인한 바와 같이 텍스트는 텍스트를 보는 환경에 따라 폰트 크기 내에서 수직 중앙 정렬이 될 수도, 아닐 수도 있다는 사실을 알았습니다. 다양한 CSS 수직 정렬 속성(`vertical-align`, `align-items`, `justify-content` 등)은 폰트 크기 내 텍스트를 정렬하는 것이 아니고 일정한 기준에 따라 폰트 자체의 위치를 조정하는 것으로 앞서 설명 드렸던 **치우쳐 보이는 이유**에서 벗어날 수 없습니다. 따라서 이것이 진정 수직 중앙 정렬한 텍스트가 치우쳐 보이는 이유입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n텍스트는 환경에 따라 정렬되어 보인다는 점이 다르다 해도 작게는 0.5px에서 크게는 2px 정도 치우쳐 보이게 됩니다. 이 정도 차이가 일반적으로 큰 문제를 일으키지는 않지만, 이 차이가 굉장히 중요한 문제를 일으키는 때가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없는 것 일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n꼭 그렇지만은 않습니다. **보편적인 환경에 대해 모든 문제를 해결하는 것은 어렵지만, 필요한 때에 필요한 곳에서는 제한적으로 대응할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### **실용적인 대응 방법**\r\r\n\r\r\n1. **CSS transform 활용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/OPVVwgR?editors=1100)\r\r\n   텍스트가 시각적으로 정확히 중앙에 보이도록 미세하게 조정이 필요한 경우 `transform` 속성을 사용하여 텍스트 위치를 조정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .vertically-centered-text {\r\r\n   display: flex;\r\r\n   align-items: center;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-0.5px); /_ 상황에 따라 값 조정 _/\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n2. **폰트별 보정 값 적용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/WbvvKzZ?editors=1400)\r\r\n   특정 폰트와 크기에서 반복적으로 발생하는 정렬 문제가 있다면, 해당 조합에 대한 보정 값을 미리 계산하여 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .apple-sd-gothic-neo {\r\r\n   font-family: 'Apple SD Gothic Neo';\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   .segoe-ui {\r\r\n   font-family: SegoeUI;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-3px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n3. **텍스트 대신 아이콘이나 SVG 사용하기**\r\r\n   정확한 수직 정렬이 매우 중요한 UI 요소(예: 버튼의 아이콘)의 경우, 텍스트 대신 SVG나 아이콘 폰트를 사용하면 더 정확한 배치가 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n4. **텍스트 박스에 패딩/마진 추가하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/pvJJZQK?editors=1400%3C/sup%3E)\r\r\n   텍스트를 담은 요소에 적절한 패딩/마진을 추가하면 미세한 정렬 차이를 눈에 덜 띄게 할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   /_ margin을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-margin {\r\r\n   margin-top: -3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   /_ padding을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-padding {\r\r\n   padding-bottom: 3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n5. **브라우저 환경 감지 및 조건부 스타일 적용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/EajjpJB)\r\r\n   특정 브라우저나 픽셀 밀도에 따라 다른 보정 값을 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```js\r\r\n   // 브라우저와 픽셀 밀도에 따른 보정 클래스 추가\r\r\n   const element = document.querySelector('.text');\r\r\n\r\r\n   if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Chrome')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('chrome-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Safari')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('safari-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Firefox')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('firefox-adjustment');\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   element.classList.add(`pixelratio-${window.devicePixelRatio}x-adjustment`);\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-2px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 결론\r\r\n\r\r\n폰트는 디자인적인 이유와 기술적인 제약으로 인해 완벽하게 수직 중앙 정렬되어 보이지 않을 수 있습니다. 이는 폰트 메트릭의 특성, 브라우저의 렌더링 방식, 픽셀 밀도 등 여러 요인이 복합적으로 작용한 결과입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n완벽한 수직 중앙 정렬을 위한 마법 같은 해결책은 없지만, 폰트의 동작 방식을 이해하고 특정 상황에 맞는 보정을 적용한다면 시각적으로 더 만족스러운 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n무엇보다 중요한 것은 이러한 차이가 '오류'가 아니라 폰트와 텍스트 렌더링의 본질적인 특성임을 이해하는 것입니다. 보통의 경우 이 미세한 차이는 사용자 경험에 큰 영향을 주지 않으므로, 지나친 완벽주의보다는 전체적인 디자인 일관성과 사용성에 집중하는 것이 바람직합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 NCUI개발팀은 NCUI 컴포넌트 라이브러리를 통해 NHN Cloud 콘솔 구현 시 더 쉽고 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있도록 돕고 있습니다. 이번 글은 그 과정에서 얻은 고민과

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에, 우리와 공동투자도 많이 하고, 나랑 개인적으로도 친한 다른 투자자와 한국의 초기 AI 스타트업과 창업가들에 대해 이야기할 기회가 있었다. 요새 한국의 초기 AI 시장 분위기는 어떤지, AI 스타트업을 만드는 창업가들은 어떤 사람들인지, 그리고 한국은 이 혼란스러운 시장에서 어떤 플레이를 해야 하는지와 같은 흥미로운 내용이었다.\n우리는 초기 회사들을 많이 만난다. 그리고 평균적으로 매달 한두 개의 신규 회사에 투자한다. 요샌 아마도 10개 회사 중 7개는 AI 조미료가 가미된 스타트업이고, 미팅은 대부분 “AI 네이티브” , “AI 퍼스트” , “AI 기반” , “AI driven”으로 시작하는데, 이런 피칭을 너무 많이 듣고, 비슷한 생각과 비슷한 말을 하는 창업가를 너무 많이 만나니까 이제 농담 반 진담 반으로 우리 팀 동료분들에게 AI 회사 피칭 하나만 더 들으면 토할 것 같다고 말할 정도이다.\n이 중 아주 좋은 회사도 가끔 있다. 정말로 AI가 스타트업의 생산성을 높여주고, 이렇게 만든 소프트웨어가 고객들의 문제를 해결해 주는, product market fitting이 제대로 된 제품도 있는데, 이게 되면 돈을 벌 수 있는 사업이 된다. 하지만, 아직 이런 회사는 소수이고 대부분의 창업가들은 그냥 AI 조미료를 먹으면서 살고 있는 것 같고, 비슷한 사업을 하는 미국의 어떤 회사처럼 1년 만에 데카콘을 만들겠다는 의지만 강하다.\nAI 회사들의 강점은 명확하다. 그리고 아주 파워풀 한 강점이다. Web 2.0의 시대가 시작되고, 이후에 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 대세가 되면서 창업의 비용과 문턱이 현저하게 낮아졌는데, 물리적인 서버를 구매하지 않고 사용하는 만큼만 지불하는 클라우드, 소프트웨어를 구매하지 않고 무료로 사용할 수 있는 오픈 소스 코드의 대세, 비싼 마케팅보단 거의 무료로 하면서 더 큰 파급력을 만들 수 있는 소셜 미디어 마케팅 등이 당시에 “창업은 비싸다”는 개념을 완전히 박살 냈다. 그리고 실제로 우리도 이후에 정말 많은 질 좋은 창업가들을 만날 수 있었다. AI로 인해 이 창업의 장벽이 다시 한번 내려가고 있고, 이에 따라 창업에 대해서 고민하던 아주 똑똑하고 수준 높은 창업가들이 창업의 첫발을 내딛는 결정을 과거 대비 쉽게 하고 있다는 걸 요새 매일매일 체감하고 있다. 이제 대부분의 노가다를 AI가 완전히상당히 많이 대체할 수 있는 수준까지 올라왔고, 우선순위는 높지 않지만, 시간과 자원이 많이 소요되는 업무에 이런 AI 대체 효과가 가장 두드러지게 보이는 것 같다.\n그런데 이게 좋기만 한 걸까? 장점이 너무 많지만, 여기에 큰 함정도 있다. 바로 창업을 너무 쉽게 생각하는 부작용이다. 창업의 장벽이 낮아진 것과 모두 다 유니콘을 만들 수 있는 건 여전히 완전히 별개이고, 솔직히 아예 상관없는데, 이 두 가지가 같다고 착각하는 창업가들이 꽤 많다. 전에는 5명의 엔지니어가 필요했다면, 이제 이보다 더 적은 팀으로 괜찮은 제품을 만들 수 있긴 하지만, 결국 AI로 만든 이 제품을 고객에게 팔아서 돈을 버는 비즈니스를 만드는 건 여전히 어렵다. 오히려 훨씬 더 어려워졌다고 생각하는 게, 이제 비슷한 제품을 똑같은 AI 모델로 누구나 만들기 때문에 고객의 기대 수준은 더 높아졌고, 이들의 지갑을 여는 건 과거 그 어느 때보다 어려워졌다.\n그리고 왜 이런 생각을 쉽게 하는지 모르겠지만, AI 기반의 사업을 하면 창업 첫날부터 글로벌 사업을 만들 수 있다고 생각하는데 이건 정말 큰 착각이다. 영어로 된 UI와 글로벌 제품과 비슷한 UX는 과거보다 쉽게 만들 수 있는 건 맞지만, 결국 외국 시장에서 사업을 하려면 외국 고객들을 알아야 하고, B2B 사업이면 외국 기업 고객들에게 영업해야 하고, 그 나라에서 결국엔 팀을 만들어야 한다. AI 사업이든 아니든 그냥 똑같이 힘들고 어려운 해외 확장 과정을 거쳐야 한다. AI first 사업이라서 첫날부터 글로벌 사업을 할 수 있다는 창업가들에게 왜 그렇게 생각하는지 물어보면, 그냥 실체가 없는 “AI native 사업이기 때문입니다.”라는 말을 하는데 이분들은 AI 조미료를 너무 많이 처먹은 것 같다.\n그리고 또 한 가지는, 이 조미료로 인해 밸류에이션이 너무 높아졌다. 비슷한 팀인데, AI로 사업을 하는 팀은 오프라인 사업을 하는 팀보다 자신에게 매기는 밸류가 말도 안 되게 높고, 역시 물어보면 해외에서 비슷한 사업을 하는 회사의 밸류에이션이 그 근거이다.\nAI 자체는 나는 대단하다고 생각한다. AI 자체에는 거품이 별로 없지만, AI 조미료가 만드는 밸류에이션과 창업가들의 허세에는 거품이 너무 많이 껴 있다고 생각한다. 이런 AI 난리 지랄을 잘 구분하고, 기대 수준을 모두 잘 관리하지 않으면 결국 벤처 생태계에 또 한 차례의 위기가 올 것이다.",
