This release includes a new command for printing package SPDX licenses, binary caching optimizations, and support for visionOS, Solaris, and illumos systems.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,653 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n34 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n282 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n101 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,000 forks and 25,300 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.07.25 release)\nThe following notable changes were made in this release:\nAdded new vcpkg command license-report, which prints the SPDX licenses from the Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) of all installed packages. In addition, SPDX licenses now also get printed for packages being installed via classic mode vcpkg install <port names> (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1514).\nBinary cache restore optimization: Now decompressing zip files ordered by size, resulting in time savings of up to 14% (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1715, thanks @autoantwort!).\nvcpkg now uses azcopy to upload large artifacts for binary caching, which enables binary cache entries > 5GB in size (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1679, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1717, thanks @dg0yt!).\nAdded support for visionOS as an available target platform for vcpkg builds (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1681, thanks @colincornaby!).\nAdded support for building and using vcpkg on Solaris and illumos systems (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1684, thanks @trisk!).\nOther minor bug fixes and internal feature improvements.\nDocumentation changes\nMinor documentation fixes (thanks @bgilbert and @ impugachev!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2442\n\n\nx64-windows\n2564\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2564\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2437\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2494\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1439\n\n\narm64-windows\n2157\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2138\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1406\n\n\nx64-osx\n2433\n\n\narm64-osx\n2359\n\n\nx64-linux\n2551\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1980\n\n\nx64-android\n2041\n\n\narm64-android\n2003\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When working in a C++ repo, you often are maintaining and updating existing code just as often as you are writing new code. However, updating code in C++ can often require navigating to several different locations in a file to ensure consistency, which can disrupt your logical workflow. For example, changing a data member’s access level typically involves several steps: moving the member between the public and private sections of the class, adding getter/setter methods, and updating all references to respect this new access level.\nGitHub Copilot now supports Next Edit Suggestions (or NES for short) to predict the next edits to come. NES in GitHub Copilot helps you stay in flow by not only helping predict where you’ll need to make updates, but also what you’ll need to change next.\nExample: Converting C code to C++\nAt Microsoft Build, we showed how NES can dynamically update C++ code, including an example of updating code syntax that was using C functions to use the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).\nFor example, when updating code that reads from stdin from C-style code that uses raw character arrays to C++ code that uses the std::string type, NES predicts and suggests updates across all applicable areas near the cursor. NES replaces calls to fgets with calls to std::getline and replaces atoi with the C++ std::stoi, which has better error handling.\n\nYou can then review and make any relevant updates – for example, in this case, any other areas that call on strings.\nNext Edit Suggestions is now available in both Visual Studio and VS Code.  As you try out NES, we’d love to hear your feedback. Share your feedback on Developer Community for Visual Studio or on GitHub for VS Code to help shape what’s next and how we can improve. If NES streamlines your workflow or saves you time, let us know – drop a comment or email us at visualcpp@microsoft.com. We’re excited to see how you’re using NES for C++!\nAgent Mode and other new Copilot features\nGitHub Copilot is evolving beyond typical code completion, with features like Next Edit Suggestions, Agent Mode, and MCP transforming how developers interact with AI. The Visual Studio session at Build not only showcased NES in action, but also Agent Mode and MCP and how they each revolutionize the traditional Copilot interfaces. While NES predicts your next code edits in the editor, agent mode can work as an iterative AI assistant that understands your intent to provide dynamic edits and information.\nTo learn more about the C++ NES use cases detailed above and these other new features available for developers in Visual Studio, watch “Top GitHub Copilot features you missed in Visual Studio 2022”.\n\nWhat do you think?\nTry out the latest Copilot features for your C++ workflows today. To access these updates to Copilot, you’ll need an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the latest version of Visual Studio.\nOur team is working hard on improving C++ integrations with Copilot, so please let us know any other enhancements you’d like to see. Share your thoughts with us on Developer Community for Visual Studio or on GitHub for VS Code to help shape what’s next and how we can improve.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The state of the research\nDiff Risk Score (DRS) is an AI-powered technology built at Meta that predicts the likelihood of a code change causing a production incident, also known as a SEV. Built on a fine-tuned Llama LLM, DRS evaluates code changes and metadata to produce a risk score and highlight potentially risky code snippets. Today, DRS powers many risk-aware features that optimize product quality, developer productivity, and computational capacity efficiency. Notably, DRS has helped us eliminate major code freezes, letting developers ship code when they historically could not with minimal impact to customer experience and the business.\nWhy it matters\nSoftware development is fraught with risk, especially for intricate, rapidly evolving, and scaled products and technologies. Because Meta operates at a global scale, we need the best tools possible to mitigate risk and to protect both user experience and advertiser outcomes.\nAI is transforming how we build products, so we committed ourselves to applying AI to improve every aspect of the software development process. Production risk was one of the areas we tackled first. We theorized that, if equipped with a model that could predict if a code change might cause a SEV, we could build features and workflows to improve almost every aspect of writing and pushing code.\nSince DRS use cases are too numerous to cover in depth here, we’ll focus on one: code unfreeze. For Meta, production incidents can drive significant negative user experience and advertiser impact. For this reason, some teams have historically “frozen” major parts of the codebase for sensitive periods like Cyber 5 holiday shopping week, preventing engineers from shipping code to reduce incident risk. For certain teams, it has cut down their holiday shopping code freeze, leading to significant improvements in productivity.\nWhile this had clear reliability benefits, the tradeoff was a substantial reduction in productivity. DRS enabled a more nuanced approach, letting developers land lower-risk changes during these periods while minimizing production incidents, thus protecting the user experience, the business, and productivity. In fact, DRS has driven meaningful productivity gains across many sensitive periods. During one such period, a major partner event in 2024, we landed 10,000+ code changes (that previously could not have landed during a freeze) with minimal production impact, enabling continued innovation and customer success. What’s more, by managing productivity and risk in this way, we benefit twice: through more code landed and through less engineering time spent detecting, understanding, and mitigating production incidents.\nCode unfreeze works well, but it’s just the start of what the technology can do. Understanding risk, even imperfectly and at a statistical level, has driven improvements for Meta in more ways than we anticipated – there are 19 use cases for risk tooling and growing!\nWhere we’re headed next\nThe success of DRS has spurred the creation of new risk-aware features across Meta that span the entire development lifecycle, from planning to post-release monitoring. The demand to build such features also led us to build the Risk Awareness Platform to provide risk analysis APIs and tool integrations.\nWe envision four major directions for risk awareness in the coming months and years.\nFirst, while we’ve seen an explosion of DRS-powered features on the Risk Awareness Platform, from optimizing build and test selection to improving reliability, selecting code reviewers, and analyzing release risks, we believe this is only the beginning. A critical problem in software engineering is maximizing innovation rate subject to a reliability threshold, so the applications of risk understanding are virtually inexhaustible. We believe code risk can play a significant role in improving this tradeoff, so we will build more risk-aware features while improving their quality. As the risk model, feature data, and user experiences improve, we’ll see greater real-world benefits for people who use Meta’s products and businesses who advertise with Meta.\nSecond, we will expand beyond code change risk to configuration change risk. While code changes cause the plurality of SEVs at Meta, configuration changes are another large category. For this reason, we’ve expanded the RAP to include models that predict the risk of various config changes. These efforts are state of the art, focused on an open research area, and earlier on the research-to-production continuum, but we believe they will soon power feature families of their own, much like DRS does today.\nThird, we want to automate the risk mitigation step. Instead of flagging risky diffs and recommending appropriate reviewers or rollback mechanisms, we want to use AI agents to proactively generate risk-mitigating changes. This can be done for code in motion (i.e. diffs or pull requests) and for code at rest to lower baseline codebase risk. Additionally, once we are armed with a greater understanding of configuration risks, these agents will be able to operate flexibly across both code and config changes.\nFourth, we will increasingly use natural language outputs to show humans what these risk-aware technologies are doing and why. By helping engineers understand the rationale behind the risk score, we’ll empower them to either mitigate risks or give the model feedback to improve accuracy. This creates a learning loop for improving both our risk models and the end user experience. LLM explainability remains an open area of research, but our teams are actively working to offer answers to common questions.\nWe are excited for the future of risk-aware software development, and we look forward to learning from—and with—our colleagues in industry as we make progress in this valuable domain.\nRead the papers\n\n“Moving Faster and Reducing Risk: Using LLMs in Release Deployment“\n“Leveraging Risk Models to Improve Productivity for Effective Code Un-Freeze at Scale”\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank all the team members and the leadership that contributed to making the DRS effort successful at Meta.

To get started, make sure that your project is built using a language supported by Qodana, such as Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, or C#. \nQodana is compatible with various IDEs and any CI pipeline, including all JetBrains IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Rider), VS Code, and Visual Studio, as well as platforms like Jenkins and .NET. You can find a list of Qodana linters here.\nIf you’re running your own TeamCity agents, ensure that Docker is installed and accessible. For users of TeamCity Cloud with JetBrains-hosted agents, this is already set up for you.\nIt’s worth noting that Qodana doesn’t currently support Windows-based build agents in TeamCity.\nConfiguring Qodana in your build pipeline\nSetting up Qodana in TeamCity is easy.\nWhile the recommended and most straightforward approach is to place your `qodana.yaml` configuration file directly in the repository, Qodana also supports dynamic configuration through TeamCity’s command-line runner. This can be helpful in edge cases, for example, if your team needs to tailor inspections dynamically based on project type, team preferences, or environment.\nThat said, for most teams, using a versioned `qodana.yaml` file ensures consistency, clarity, and traceability across builds.\nTo learn how to set up dynamic configuration in TeamCity, view our response to this query. \nPrefer something more visual? Explore Qodana’s code coverage reports in the TeamCity UI – no scripting required.\nStep 1: In TeamCity, go to the configuration page of your build and add a new build step. \nStep 2: Select the Qodana build runner, and then expand the advanced options to customize its behavior.\nStep 3: Define the linter you’d like to use, specify a version, and point to either a default or custom inspection profile. If you’re using Qodana Cloud, you can also add a project token at this stage. This is required for commercial linters, but optional for community ones.\nbuildType {\n    steps {\n        qodana {\n            name = \"Qodana analysis\"\n            linter = jvm {\n                version = Qodana.JVMVersion.LATEST\n            }\n            inspectionProfile = embedded {\n                name = \"qodana.starter\"\n            }\n            cloudToken = \"%qodana.cloud.token%\"\n            additionalQodanaArguments = \"--baseline qodana.sarif.json\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOptional step: For more granular control, you can configure things like a unique report ID, working directory, or whether Qodana reports should be visible under the Tests tab in TeamCity. There’s also support for advanced parameters, such as Docker arguments or additional Qodana CLI options.\nFor more detailed instructions and more on the function of each step, view the docs. \nConfigure Qodana in TeamCity\n\n\n\n\nQuality gates and baseline comparisons\nQuality gates are tools that let you stop code from being merged to the main branch if it doesn’t meet specific requirements, or if too severe or too many issues are flagged. If a quality gate condition fails, Qodana terminates using exit code 255, which makes a CI/CD workflow or pipeline fail. \nQodana makes it easy to set up quality gates that fail a build when the number of issues exceeds a set threshold. It also supports baseline functionality, which allows you to compare the current analysis results with a previous state. This helps identify new problems instead of flagging the same issues with every analysis.\nBoth of these features are configured using simple command-line arguments in the Qodana runner. There are various ways you can set this up. For example, you can create a quality gate that considers the number of problems before allowing code to be merged (more flexible settings are available in `qodana.yaml`):\nfailureConditions:\n  severityThresholds:\n    any: 10 # Total problems\n    critical: 5 # Critical and other severities\n    high: 5\n    moderate: 10\n    low: 20\n    info: 20\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of quality gates and baseline functionality can help your team avoid a crisis as well as unnecessary noise from legacy issues.\nSet Up Quality Gates\nCustom configuration with scripts\nIf your project requires a custom inspection profile or specific exclusions, you can use a `qodana.yaml` file. You can either include this file in your repository or use a script in TeamCity to generate it on the fly.\n\n\n\n\nView Configuration Docs\nViewing results in TeamCity or Qodana Cloud\nOnce your build runs, Qodana offers flexible options for reviewing results. You can access detailed analysis directly in the Qodana tab within TeamCity, making it easy to spot issues alongside your other build diagnostics.\nAlternatively, you can explore the results in Qodana Cloud, which provides a web-based dashboard with collaboration tools, history tracking, and integration with issue trackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting pull requests and branch analysis\nQodana also works well in pull request workflows. The purpose of pull request analysis is to examine code changes in a pull request or merge request, detecting issues introduced or fixed by that specific change.\nQodana compares the current branch against the target branch (e.g. `main` or `develop`), and then it highlights issues only in the changed files or lines.\nBy configuring VCS triggers in TeamCity, you can analyze merge requests or specific branches before they’re integrated into your main codebase. This adds an essential layer of quality assurance to every code review.\nThen baseline track new problems introduced over time by comparing the current analysis results with a previous “clean” state.\nYou can generate a baseline file, and in future runs, Qodana compares the current issues against this baseline. Only new issues (not present in the baseline) are reported as problems.\nThese approaches can be combined for better quality gates and enforcement.\nTeamCity Cloud and Qodana Cloud for better quality software products\nIntegrating Qodana into your TeamCity pipeline gives you a solid foundation for a healthier codebase. With static analysis running automatically as part of your build process, you reduce the chance of bugs slipping through and can use Qodana to enforce quality as a team.\nTeamCity and Qodana compliment each other, with TeamCity managing your builds with Qodana ensuring that your code is clean and something you can be proud of. Both help prevent future issues, and together, they offer an automated, and scalable approach to CI/CD – with built-in code quality from day one.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I use Qodana to analyze .NET projects?\nTo analyze .NET projects, you can use the `qodana-dotnet` Docker image or the native solution based on Rider. There’s also a Community Edition available via the `qodana-cdnet` Docker image, but it’s better to use the trial version of a paid license for greater functionality.\nWhy is TeamCity often used with Qodana instead of other analyzers?\nTeamCity and Qodana are both created by JetBrains, which means deep integration that’s not easily reproduced by competitors. \nWhere can I get assistance if I have an issue? \nYou can visit this TeamCity Support page or email Qodana Support.\nDon’t have TeamCity?

We support multiple LLM providers across our AI products to ensure you have access to the right tools for your needs and the freedom to choose the ones you prefer.\nToday, we’re excited to announce that the latest model from OpenAI, GPT-5, is now available in our AI products: AI Assistant, Junie, and Kineto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA leap forward in developer AI\nIn one of the most exciting recent developments in AI news, OpenAI has just revealed the new GPT-5 model. At JetBrains, we had the opportunity to access and test GPT-5 early. \n“Iterative deployment helps ensure we approach and launch new model capabilities with the highest levels of rigor. Working with JetBrains on GPT-5 is the latest example of how their feedback and early testing will help us identify the API’s optimal impact where it matters most for their users.”\nOlivier Godement, Head of Business Products at OpenAI\nBased on our testing, we consider GPT-5 a game changer for coding. It can handle larger, more complex development tasks with greater accuracy and reliability.\nJunie, the coding agent, now powered by GPT-5\nWith GPT-5 integrated, Junie becomes significantly more capable. In our internal benchmarks, GPT-5 delivered 1.5× to 2× improvements in code quality, task complexity handling, and overall performance compared to the previous OpenAI models. GPT-5 is set as the default model for Junie, but you can always change it in the plugin’s settings. \nIn this example, Junie was asked to create a hidden snake game as an Easter egg in a footer. \n\n\n\n\nIt not only identified the precise place to inject the feature in a large codebase, but it also accounted for dependencies and layout constraints – delivering production-ready code, fully integrated and bug-free.\nJetBrains AI Assistant gets a boost with GPT-5\nWith the latest update, JetBrains AI Assistant now has GPT-5 selected as the default model for chat, as it offers the best generation quality currently available, balanced with optimized costs.\nIn the example below, we give AI Assistant a single prompt asking it to create an HTML5 page showing what a JetBrains IDE could look like in 2030. This single prompt was enough for GPT-5 to generate a fully responsive, styled, and interactive prototype, demonstrating its exceptional capabilities when paired with JetBrains AI Assistant.\n\n\n\n\nHow to try GPT-5 in your IDE\nYou can try GPT-5 in your JetBrains IDE (starting from version 2025.2) by updating to the latest versions of the AI Assistant and Junie plugins (Settings | Plugins). GPT-5 will be available in AI Assistant’s chat and Junie as your default model.\nGet Started\n                                                    \nPowering creators with no-code solutions via Kineto and GPT-5 \nGPT-5 is particularly useful when it comes to frontend-related tasks. This is why we set this model as the default for Kineto, our brand-new no-code AI platform for generating websites and apps. GPT-5 gave Kineto a significant boost in creating single-purpose apps from user prompts with no coding required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKineto is now in the Early Access Program. Join the waitlist to try it. \nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "You’ve seen it before. Someone says, “It works on my machine,” and suddenly you’re deep in a rabbit hole trying to understand why a project that works perfectly on one machine fails to build or test on another.\nThat’s configuration drift – when a developer’s actual environment starts to deviate from the project’s intended configuration. It’s subtle, builds up over time, and can create serious issues.\nWhy it happens\nRarely intentional, configuration drift occurs when your development environment, including its associated packages, versions, system tools, and environment variables, slowly strays from the standard setup everyone is supposed to use.\nSome collaborators update their version of Node.js or Python, others don’t. Someone installs a CLI tool globally. Someone else tweaks a config file and forgets to share it. Files like .env.local or ignored setup scripts go out of sync. None of this is malicious – it’s just difficult to keep track of every little change you make to your setup over time. However, when it happens across a team, the differences pile up fast.\nWhy configuration drift is a real problem\nOn small projects, config drift is annoying. On larger ones, it can quickly cause major headaches. Some of the main issues that configuration drift can lead to include:\nConfiguration discrepancies\nThis is where the classic “But it works on my machine” comment typically arises. You get a bug report from a teammate, but you can’t reproduce it because your environment isn’t quite the same as theirs. Now the team is stuck hunting for invisible differences in local setups.\nInconsistent test results\nOne dev runs the test suite, and everything passes. Another runs it, and half the tests fail. It turns out they had slightly different dependency versions or a missing env var. Nobody wins.\nBroken CI/CD pipelines\nThe code works fine locally but breaks during deployment. CI environments generally enforce stricter and more consistent configurations than local machines. If you forget to commit a config or miss a setup step, the CI server will quickly expose the issue.\nWasted time debugging the setup\nMuch of the onboarding process for new developers involves tracking down weird setup issues. Every little obstacle – whether a misconfigured shell, a missing Python version, or a random global package – chips away at productivity.\nNo matter the symptom, the result is the same: hours lost on non-coding work, slower teams, frustrated devs, and harder-to-maintain projects. And none of this work involves the actual product. It’s about addressing environment-related issues.\nSo, how do people usually deal with it?\nMost teams try to keep developer environments consistent. Some methods help a lot, while others just mask the problem. Let’s look at the most common approaches and where they fall short.\nPinning tool versions and environment variables\nThis is where most projects start. You pin your Node.js or Python version using tools like nvm, pyenv, or asdf. You commit a .tool-versions or .nvmrc file so that everyone runs the same runtime.\nNext comes the .env file. You insert your API URLs, tokens, and maybe a couple of feature flags and call it a day.\nThis works until someone forgets to source the .env file, uses a newer tool version locally, or runs into a weird bug because their shell config or OS version is slightly different.\nThe bottom line is this tactic sets expectations but doesn’t enforce anything.\nAutomating setup with scripts\nWhatever your team uses, whether Makefiles, Bash scripts, just, or Ansible, the idea is the same: one command sets up your whole development environment.\nAs this approach gives you reproducible setup instructions and helps new teammates onboard faster, it’s more effective. But it’s not a silver bullet. These scripts aren’t idempotent. They assume a clean state. If a developer tweaks something manually later, the script won’t fix it. And it can’t stop configuration drift once it starts.\nUsing dev containers or declarative environments\nDockerfiles and devcontainer.json definitions let you standardize development at the system level. Add Nix, Guix, or Devbox to the mix, and now you can describe everything (dependencies, system packages, and tooling) in a single config file.\nAs this approach allows you to rebuild the same environment every time, it’s a big step forward with no surprises.\nHowever, working inside Docker can feel clunky. Performance isn’t always great, debugging can be painful, and advanced tools like Nix, while powerful, are notoriously hard to learn. One wrong expression and you’re staring at a wall of cryptic errors.\nSo yes, these approaches reduce drift, but they also add friction. And you’re still ultimately running things on different machines with different host systems, hardware, and edge cases.\nA better solution: Cloud dev environments\nImagine if your dev environment didn’t live on your laptop, but it felt like it did. With today’s cloud development environments (CDEs), your workspace runs remotely, but the UI is streamed using optimized protocols designed specifically for coding and development tasks – no clunky VDI. The result? A native-like IDE experience that’s fast, responsive, and consistent, no matter where you are – no hidden state or outdated dependencies! It’s like getting a fresh, clean laptop every time you open your IDE.\nBut running CDEs at scale requires a way to define, manage, and connect those environments to the tools your team already uses. That’s where orchestration solutions like GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, and Coder come in, providing a control layer over CDEs.\nAt JetBrains, we’ve built our own CDE orchestrator: CodeCanvas. It gives you everything you’d expect from a CDE orchestration platform, including centralized templates, setup scripts, and security policies, but with one huge advantage – first-class support for JetBrains IDEs. And if you’re more into VS Code or Cursor, CodeCanvas supports those tools, too.\nJetBrains CodeCanvas\nIf you’re ready to give CDEs a try, install CodeCanvas in your AWS account. It takes only a few steps:\nLaunch the installation (an AWS account is required)\nFollow the installation instructions\n\n\n\n\nPlanning a more complex setup or looking to discuss how CodeCanvas can work in your infrastructure? Contact us – we’ll be happy to help!\nWant to learn more about the benefits of CDEs and whether your company should consider adopting them?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to this month’s Java Annotated Monthly – your pit stop for all things related to Java, Kotlin, frameworks, and the ever-shifting tech scene. From helpful reads to red-hot takes, we’ve lined up a range of articles for curious devs and ambitious teams.\nBut wait, there’s more! As always, our AI corner is here, and we’ve sprinkled in some thought-provoking, non-tech gems on building better teams and smarter products.\nOh, and don’t miss the special feature by A N M Bazlur Rahman! He’s bringing you his top picks, personal reflections, and sharp takes on where the dev world’s heading. Trust us, it’s a ride worth taking.\nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nA N M Bazlur Rahman\n\nA N M Bazlur Rahman is a Java Champion, Jakarta EE Ambassador, and Software Engineer with over 12 years of specialized experience in Java and related technologies. He is the founder and moderator of the Java User Group in Bangladesh, and has been organizing educational meetups and conferences since 2013. Bazlur is a veteran editor at InfoQ and a contributing editor at Foojay.io. He has authored six books on Java programming, including Modern Concurrency in Java with O’Reilly, scheduled for release in September. He is also working on his seventh book, Build Smart Java Applications with Large Language Models, with his friend Shaaf Syed and Manning Publications. When not coding or writing, you can find him speaking at conferences and Java User Groups, sharing his passion for Java, Jakarta EE, and the integration of AI technologies into enterprise applications.\n \n\n\nJava and AI integration takes center stage\nAs a Java developer with a recent interest in the AI integration space, I’m excited to share what I consider the most transformative period in Java’s 30-year history. The ecosystem has reached a tipping point where AI integration is no longer experimental. It’s production-ready, and Java developers are embracing it at an unprecedented pace. From my recent talk at GeeCON 2025 in Kraków to my hands-on experiments building AI-powered applications, I’ve witnessed firsthand how Java is becoming the go-to platform for enterprise AI development.\nThe foundation of this revolution lies in the language itself. JDK 25 is shaping up to be a landmark release, with features that directly benefit AI workloads. The game changer is JEP 519: Compact Object Headers, with Amazon reporting 22% less heap usage and 8% faster execution in production. However, what really excites me is JEP 505: Structured Concurrency (Fifth Preview), which I explored in depth in my article, Java’s Structured Concurrency: Finally Finding Its Footing. This feature simplifies concurrent programming by treating related tasks as single units, making them ideal for orchestrating multiple AI model calls. Combined with instance main methods becoming final in JDK 25, which provides a pleasing experience for beginners, Project Leyden and the evolving Vector API are positioning Java as a serious contender for AI workloads.\nThe framework landscape has me particularly excited. The general availability of Spring AI 1.0 streamlines AI app development with support for 20+ models and built-in RAG capabilities. LangChain4j’s 1.1.0 release introduces comprehensive guardrail support – something I’ve written about extensively in Building Robust AI Applications with LangChain4j Guardrails and Spring Boot, complete with plenty of code examples. Microsoft’s strategic partnership with LangChain4j has resulted in extensive security audits, making it truly enterprise-ready. However, the real showstopper is Rod Johnson’s Embabel agent framework, which he describes as “the most significant project since Spring Framework itself.” It brings goal-oriented action planning from gaming to create deterministic, explainable AI agents with strong typing. What’s equally exciting is seeing the integration of LangChain4j with MicroProfile and Jakarta specifications take shape, bringing AI capabilities to enterprise Java standards. \nTo help developers navigate this landscape, my friend Shaaf Syed and I created the llm-jakarta GitHub project, which provides a progressive learning path through Jakarta EE and LLM integration, comprising 10 practical steps. We plan to add more examples combining Spring Boot and Quarkus soon. \nFor those interested in GPU acceleration, I recommend checking out GPULlama3.java Brings GPU-Accelerated LLM Inference to Pure Java, which showcases how Java can leverage hardware acceleration for AI workloads.\nCloud providers are fully committed to Java’s AI future. Oracle launched generative AI with LangChain4j integration, and Google released their Agent Development Kit for Java, both of which are crucial for adopting modern AI features. Microsoft’s comprehensive Java and AI strategy includes native integration with Azure. \nI’ve been experimenting with these features extensively, documenting my findings in my newsletter, The Coding Café, where I share practical experiments, such as building FormPilot and creating an AI-powered flight tracker.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the first-ever standalone What’s Fixed overview of an IntelliJ IDEA release!\nWe are always working hard to make the IDE even more stable, reliable, and enjoyable to use. In previous releases, information about this work was blended into the What’s New content, making it very long and sometimes hard to grasp. To address this issue, we’ve decided to focus the What’s New only on the most impactful and noticeable changes and to introduce a dedicated What’s Fixed article that focuses on the stability and quality improvements.\nThe key areas we have been working on in this release are:\nSpring support\n\nKotlin support in Spring projects\nSpring Security and Spring Web\nRemote development\nSupport for WSL\nKotlin K2 mode\nKotlin Notebook\nMaven execution\nCloud tooling\nPerformance\nBut that’s not everything. For the full list of fixes and improvements, please refer to the release notes. \nImproved Kotlin support for Spring projects\nWith Kotlin proving itself as a good fit for the Spring Framework, more and more people are using it in Spring projects. To deliver the best developer experience, we formed a partnership between Kotlin and Spring, and we are actively improving IntelliJ IDEA’s Kotlin-Spring support. Version 2025.2 brings:\nLive templates and context menu actions for creating Spring beans quickly, along with improvements to the Logical structure view to make understanding the relations between application components easier.\nSmarter bean support: No more false injection points for constructor parameters for @SpringBootTest or for parameters with defaults, and improved handling of @ConditionalOnProperty beans.\nConfiguration made clear: The ability to go from @ConfigurationProperties to YAML or properties with a click, default values in code completion, and full support for nested properties.\nSpring MVC improvements: An easier experience with path variables in request handlers, thanks to clear feedback when something doesn’t match.\nSpring Data fixes: Better repository method completion for is properties, as well as cleaner support for varargs, projections, and named queries.\nSpring Framework support\nSpring Framework support is a key focus area for IntelliJ IDEA. In addition to new functionality such as Spring Debugger, we continue to enhance existing features.\nIn this release, we’ve resolved a couple of minor but frustrating issues related to rule parsing in Spring Security:\nCustom login and logout URLs are now processed correctly. \nComplex security configurations involving multiple role assignments for a single endpoint are now properly parsed.\nWe’ve also enhanced support for the widely used Spring Web library. URL references – especially in MockMvc tests – are now properly recognized and autocompleted.\nRemote development\nRemote development – connecting to a powerful remote host where the IDE runs from a thin frontend client – is becoming the norm, with many enterprises relying on it.\nWe are fully committed to making the remote development experience in IntelliJ IDEA equal to the local one. While it has proven to be a hard endeavor for such a complex product as IntelliJ IDEA, and achieving this goal is taking time, version 2025.2 marks a huge step in this direction:\nThe editor is now as responsive when working remotely as it is in a local setup.\nThis is also true for the Search Everywhere, Find in Files, and Git Branches popups.\nThe debugger has been reworked so that its backend is isolated from its frontend, making debugging work natively.\nPlugins and settings are properly synchronized between the client and host.\nLast but not least – remote development connections are now available directly in the Toolbox app, with support for all OS and OpenSSH connections. And you know what? They are at least 1.5x faster!\nFor more details, refer to this blog post.\nSupport for WSL\nThe majority of our users are on Windows, which is known to have some performance limitations and specific toolchains. That is where WSL comes in handy, and roughly one out of every five Windows users works with WSL eventually.\nIntelliJ IDEA has offered WSL support for some time. However, the way we chose to provide the integration proved unscalable and did not work well for large projects – with issues ranging from performance problems to the inability to run or even open projects.\nTo ensure you can stay productive regardless of where your project is, we started a rework of the WSL integration from the ground up. The IntelliJ Platform team created a new API that dramatically reduces communication overhead between the IDE and WSL and allows you to work with WSL projects natively as though they were in the same system as the host IntelliJ IDEA – without needing to spin up a full backend inside WSL.\nWhile this is still a work in progress, we have migrated significant parts of the integration to this new API. As a result, in 2025.2:\nMaven and Gradle projects can be reliably built and tested, with proper JDK detection and better overall performance.\nYou now have a consistent experience with application servers, whether you’re running Tomcat or WildFly servers locally or on WSL.\nFurther improvements to Kotlin K2 mode\nK2 mode, the new default implementation of Kotlin support that improves Kotlin code analysis stability and overall performance, continues to evolve. In this release, we’ve:\nProvided support for Kotlin 2.2 features.\nImproved the performance of code completion.\nAdded type-smart completion support. \nAdded new inspections with corresponding coroutine-specific quick-fixes and refactorings, like Convert Enum to Sealed Class, Extract Interface, Rearrange Code, and Create Test and Navigate for files and functions.\nResolved several false-positive errors in inspections.\nImproved the reliability of Kotlin script execution. \nLearn more about the state of K2 mode in our recent blog post.\nQuality upgrades for Kotlin Notebook\nKotlin Notebook is a go-to tool for performing ad hoc and prototyping tasks, presenting, writing documentation, and visualizing data, all while enjoying access to your project context and easy dependency management. Since its recent release, interest in it has been growing, and we’ve received a lot of feedback that we are now addressing, focusing on stability and the editing experience.\nAI Assistant cells now allow you to choose a model, view the prompt history, and get automatic suggestions.\nIncorrect syntax highlighting has been fixed.\nDependency management has been improved.\nKotlin intentions and inspections have been added to make the editing experience close to what you get in a regular .kt file. \nMaven execution\nMaven integration is used by half of our users. Historically, IntelliJ IDEA has additional configuration layers on top of Maven, and while they bring speed and control, some differences between execution from the IDE and from the CLI could occur. \nOne of the common reasons for such problems was that the specific environment configuration – the .m2/settings file, .mavenrc, or environment variables – was not properly inherited. Starting from 2025.2, IntelliJ IDEA starts Maven goals in such a way that the environment is fully respected.\nThanks to this change, it is now possible to use the Maven Daemon for goal execution. If you have one installed, specify it as a Maven home path in File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven, and all goals will be run using it, speeding things up a bit and reducing resource usage.\nProject sync and goal execution now also support plugins that supply custom M2E lifecycles, for example, Byte Buddy. When such plugins are present, the required pre-build and post-build steps will be configured and executed as necessary.\nCloud tooling\nInteraction with cloud services is now a major part of software development workflows. This includes the building, deployment, and sometimes managing remote environments. Terraform and Kubernetes are key tools in these scenarios, which is why they are our focus areas.\nFor Terraform, the 2025.2 update brings: \nBetter support for provider-defined functions:\n\nCorrect syntax highlighting.\nQuick navigation to provider definitions. \nOn-hover documentation.\nDefault code formatter.\nAuto-completion for object variables. \nSpecific support for the Keycloak provider.\nSupport for resources in Google Cloud Beta.\nAbility to use for_each in import blocks.\nAccurate binary detection on Windows.\nTerraform file recognition.\nFor Kubernetes, there are: \nImproved port-forwarding with automatic suggestions for ports and real-time checks for availability.\nBetter performance when working with large log files.\nMore information about pods.\nAuto-marking of the active cluster.\nOn top of that, this update improves the GitLab CI integration with: \nSmarter support for CI language variable expressions.\nRich code completion. \nOn-hover documentation. \nSupport for injecting shell code directly into your pipelines.\nDebugger\nDebugging and profiling are essential tools for developing high-quality software, and we strive to make sure that IntelliJ IDEA’s debugger remains best in class. On top of the huge rework to provide a native debugging experience when working remotely, we’ve also fixed issues and provided additional capabilities for existing use cases.\nYou can now evaluate code on any application pause during execution, not just at breakpoints.\nThe Analyze Stack Trace or Thread Dump action can now analyze outputs from the jstack and jcmd tools, including in the new JSON format.\nThe Collect Thread Dump action now works with the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM.\nGraalVM debugger\nCompiling JVM applications to native code significantly reduces CPU and memory usage, but debugging native images remains challenging. In this release, we’ve improved the native image debugger:\nVariable rendering provides richer information, for example, full object content and details about proxy objects.\nExpression evaluation has been enhanced, making reflection calls such as clazz.getMethod(“myMethod”).invoke(instance) work correctly. \nProfiler \nThe profiling experience depends on the Java version, and there used to be cases when it didn’t work with Java 24 and the upcoming Java 25. We fixed the failures and implemented support for new language features. You can now reliably profile your application on any Java version and also easily integrate Async-Profiler 4 into your workflow.\nPerformance\nTerminal\nIn 2025.2, we’ve enabled the reworked terminal for all users. This change brings significant improvements in rendering and overall terminal performance. For bash and zsh, it also brings some minor visual changes, but without compromising the shells’ behavior. \nWorking with data sources\nWhen working with large databases, the IDE used to load the entire schema, which produced overhead and was rather slow. Now, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server are introspected by levels, so only specific parts of the schema are loaded, reducing this overhead.\nPostgreSQL users also benefit from smart refresh, which updates only the objects affected by DDL changes.\nDeveloper experience\nWe have also invested effort into small UX improvements, especially in areas related to reading code. For example, we’ve reworked the Parameter Info popup to make it cleaner, more readable, and easier to use across all supported languages.\nThat’s it for now \nLet us know what you think about the fixes and priorities in this release. Your feedback helps us steer the product so it works best for you.\nUpdate to IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 now and see how it has improved. Don’t forget to join us on X, Bluesky, or LinkedIn and share your favorite updates. \nThank you for using IntelliJ IDEA!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The value of extensibility\nThe ability to extend and customize software, from game mods to browser extensions, gives users a sense of freedom and the chance to bring their ideas to life. JetBrains IDEs already provide this sense of freedom through their support for plugins.\nFor some time now, creating plugins for JetBrains IDEs has been possible, but getting started with these sorts of projects can be intimidating. Navigating documentation, project templates, IntelliJ Platform dependencies, and Gradle configurations can be overwhelming for those wanting to experiment and test their ideas in real-world scenarios. Luckily, there’s now a more efficient option!\nIntroducing Kotlin Notebook\nKotlin Notebook is an interactive platform for data analysis, visualization, and prototyping with Kotlin. Like Jupyter Notebook, it provides a robust environment for data scientists, engineers, and researchers to explore and showcase their work within a dynamic, executable document. It combines Kotlin’s capabilities with the interactiveness of notebooks, allowing you to write and run code while seeing the results and visualizations in the same environment. This encourages an iterative workflow, boosting productivity and collaboration on data projects.\nBuilding on the Kotlin Notebook plugin, we have started exploring how to connect it with the IntelliJ Platform. This enables the direct execution of IntelliJ Platform code from a notebook file within the active IDE runtime. The iterative workflow of Kotlin notebooks allows you to brainstorm, build, and test plugin features faster. The integration with the IntelliJ Platform makes moving the finished code into your plugin easy.\nThis initial idea has developed into a strong integration, and as of the 2025.2 release, the functionality is now available for use.\nGetting started: A practical guide\nTo get started, create a new Kotlin notebook either as a new file in your project or as a scratch file, using ⌘⇧N on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows/Linux.\nNotebooks are based on the concept of cells. To start using this integration, switch to Run in IDE Process mode, create a new code cell, and declare:\n%use intellij-platform\nDue to the technical issues on Windows, it’s recommended to explicitly request the latest available version until the IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2.1 is released using:\n%useLatestDescriptors\n%use intellij-platform\nOnce you do this, the necessary IntelliJ Platform libraries will be loaded into the notebook’s classpaths, making them available for import in the subsequent cells.\n\nCore features\nUI rendering made simple\nThe ability to run code within the same IDE environment removes the need to build a full plugin project to test UI components. The runInEdt {} The helper ensures that the code runs on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), catching any exceptions and showing them below your cell.\n\nReturning UI elements as a response when working with the Kotlin UI DSL or standard Swing components renders them immediately. All rendered components stay fully interactive.\n\nResource management with the Disposer\nThe integration uses the Disposer mechanism available in the IntelliJ Platform. A dedicated global notebookDisposable variable allows for registering and later disposing of specific notebook elements, such as extensions, listeners, actions, or UI components. This ensures the IDE manages the lifetime of your objects when you close the project or restart the notebook.\n// Register something that needs cleanup\nDisposer.register(notebookDisposable, myDisposable)\n\nDisposer.register(notebookDisposable) {\n  // Cleanup components directly\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading plugins\nWhen you integrate your notebook with the IntelliJ Platform, only the core platform is initially loaded into the classpath, similarly to when you’re working on a standalone plugin. However, you may need to depend on and use other plugins, whether bundled or installed from JetBrains Marketplace. To load plugins installed in your IDE, you must explicitly call the loadPlugins(vararg pluginIds: String) helper.\n// Load specific plugins\nloadPlugins(\"Git4Idea\", \"com.intellij.java\")\n\nExtension registration\nIn traditional plugin development, extensions are defined in the plugin.xml file. With Kotlin notebooks, you can dynamically register extensions using registerExtension(), avoiding the need for a structured plugin project.\nFor example, to register a custom ChatMessageHandler and ChatAgent for the AI Assistant plugin, you can simply run the following:\nloadPlugins(\"com.intellij.ml.llm\")\nclass MyChatMessageHandler : ChatMessageHandler {\n\n    override fun isApplicable(project: Project, kind: ChatKind, userMessage: UserMessage) = true\n\n    override fun createAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        userMessage: UserMessage,\n        kind: ChatKind,\n    ) = SimpleCompletableMessage(chat)\n\n    override suspend fun serveAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        answerMessage: ChatMessage,\n        smartChatEndpoints: List<SmartChatEndpoint>,\n    ) {\n        ChatAgent.EP_NAME.extensionList\n            .find { it.id == \"groot\" }\n            ?.serveAnswerMessage(project, chat, answerMessage)\n    }\n}\n\nregisterExtension(ChatMessageHandler.EP, MyChatMessageHandler())\nclass MyChatAgent : ChatAgent {\n\n    override val id = \"groot\"\n    override val name = \"I am Groot\"\n\n    override fun createAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        userMessage: UserMessage,\n        kind: ChatKind,\n    ) = SimpleCompletableMessage(chat)\n\n    override suspend fun serveAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        answerMessage: ChatMessage,\n    ) {\n        answerMessage as SimpleCompletableMessage\n        answerMessage.appendText(\"*I am Groot*\".privacyConst)\n    }\n}\n\nregisterExtension(ChatAgent.EP_NAME, MyChatAgent())\nSimilarly, you can register a custom UI theme as follows:\nimport com.intellij.ide.ui.UIThemeProvider\n\nval theme = UIThemeProvider().apply { \n    id = \"My Theme\"\n    path = \"Theme.json\"\n}\nregisterExtension(UIThemeProvider.EP_NAME, theme)\nThis approach allows you to experiment and test extensions instantly within the IDE runtime, streamlining development and saving time.\nExploring your IDE environment\nThe integration provides several ways to access the internal details of the currently running IDE, such as its build details and location in the file system. Exposed mechanisms such as the Plugin Manager and Plugin Repository allow for interacting with plugins available in JetBrains Marketplace, or even ones installed locally. All available variables and helper methods are documented in the relevant section in the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation.\n// Access IDE information\nproductInfo.name        // \"IntelliJ IDEA\"\nproductInfo.version     // \"2025.3\"\nproductInfo.buildNumber // \"253.xxxx\"\n\nidePath // “/Users/hsz/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.3 Nightly.app/Contents”\n\nide // com.jetbrains.plugin.structure.ide.Ide instance\n\n// Work with the plugin manager\npluginManager.findEnabledPlugin(PluginId.getId(\"com.intellij.java\"))\n\n// Request JetBrains Marketplace\npluginRepository.pluginManager.searchCompatibleUpdates(\n    build = \"${productInfo.productCode}-${productInfo.buildNumber}\",\n    xmlIds = listOf(“org.jetbrains.junie”),\n    channel = “default”,\n)\nOpportunities and improvements\nIntegrating Kotlin Notebook with the IntelliJ Platform represents a significant step forward for custom plugin development. With traditional barriers associated with project setup, compilation, and deployment removed, developers can now concentrate more effectively on implementing their ideas.\nWe already have great ideas for ways to improve this experience further:\nRapid prototyping of IDE features and plugins: This functionality allows for the development of features, with the potential for AI assistance in the refinement process. Once you’ve completed a scratch implementation of your plugin in your notebook file and it is ready to be adapted for use in a Plugin Template-based project, you can use Junie to convert it and give it a formal plugin structure.\nExpeditious testing of platform APIs and behaviors: The JetBrains QA teams are already using Kotlin notebooks to debug the IntelliJ Platform more quickly, achieving particular success when using them with a UI testing framework. Improving scripting and adding reusable helpers can make notebooks more adaptable and suited to this use case.\nInteractive documentation and tutorials for IntelliJ Platform development: The storytelling style of notebooks, combining runnable code snippets with explanatory comments, can create a more engaging learning experience.\nCompose/Jewel support: As development advances in this area, the ability to render Compose/Jewel components is a natural next step, mirroring the current functionality supplied by Java Swing or the Kotlin UI DSL. This can be especially useful for prototyping IDE-specific UI/UX elements, whether you’re developing plugins or working on an entire IDE based on the IntelliJ Platform.\nTake it for a spin and let us know what you think!\nFollow these simple steps to get started:\nCreate a new Kotlin Notebook.\nSwitch to Run in IDE Process mode.\nUnleash your creativity with %use intellij-platform.\nIf you’d like to share feedback, please visit the JetBrains Platform forum, where we can discuss any challenges and ideas for improving this integration. You can also join the #notebooks public Slack channel for discussions and questions.\nThe IntelliJ Platform integration and the examples featured in this article are now publicly accessible on GitHub, along with a dedicated section in the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation. We welcome pull requests with ideas to improve the user experience.\nHappy hacking!\nJakub",

Cloud-based features have credit-based limits.\nInstall AI Assistant\n                                                    \nDebugger: Remote targets, on-chip debugging, and more\nYou can now run the debugger on remote targets. Just start gdbserver and set up a remote debug configuration. That’s it; you’re all set to debug. Both GDB and LLDB are supported, as well as custom GDB executables.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use the remote debug configuration to debug embedded targets using OpenOCD.\nOther new debugger features include:\nThe ability to attach to unstarted processes\nImproved assembly support\nA parallel stacks view\nShadow variable support\nSupport for self-referential types\n\n\n\n\nLast but not least, the Windows distribution now also comes with LLDB-19 bundled and enabled by default. If you prefer, you can always switch back to LLDB-9 in the settings. Read more about debugger updates. \nNew color scheme\nWith a language as tricky as Rust, we wanted the colors and font styles to aid understanding by emphasizing important constructs and helping differentiate between elements that may look confusingly similar. And now, we are excited to present the new color scheme to you! It is enabled by default and can be adjusted for users with red-green color vision deficiency. Give it a try and let us know what you think!\n\n\n\n\nInlays for tracking implicit mutable borrows\nWe want to help you address borrow checker errors. As implicit mutable borrows and reborrows are a common source of these issues, we decided to mark them with special inlays. These make them easier to spot and may assist with troubleshooting or help you avoid errors altogether.\n\n\n\n\nSimplified module creation\nWe have added a quick way to add Rust modules. Simply select the parent module (directory or file) and then use the + menu in the Project view to add your desired module. The popup dialog will ask you to name the new module and specify whether it should be a file or a directory. RustRover will add the necessary definition for you.\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced UI for comparing mismatched types\nTypes in Rust can be complicated, especially if they are compound and nested. To make it easier to spot mismatched types, we have changed the way they are presented in the error tooltip. Hopefully, this will help you troubleshoot!\n\n\n\n\nNew to Rust? RustRover has got you covered\nFor newcomers to Rust, RustRover provides great ways to start learning. Besides the Learn Rust course by JetBrains Academy, which is based on the popular Rustlings exercises, we now also provide 100 Exercises to Learn Rust, based on a course of the same name by Mainmatter’s Luca Palmieri. Both JetBrains Academy courses provide a fun, hands-on way to learn Rust fundamentals and practice coding in a professional environment. Give it a try or, if you’re already a seasoned Rustacean, spread the word to a friend!\n\n\n\n\nRust plugin: Now free for CLion\nGood news for those who prefer coding in Rust while also having C/C++ tools at hand – the Rust plugin is now free for CLion! And with CLion now free for non-commercial use, this is a great opportunity to practice combining these stacks.\nNew Rename Cargo Package action\nFrom your feedback, we learned that RustRover needed a specific action for renaming whole packages. So, in 2025.2, we’ve added a Rename CargoPackage action. It propagates the new name to Cargo.toml and related usages. For now, the action works unless the crate name is referenced in other Cargo.toml files, but we will keep working on supporting this case too.\n\n\n\n\nRemote development updates\nFor remote development, our goal is to provide a coding experience that is just as reliable and consistent as working locally. In version 2025.2, improvements include quicker editor responsiveness, smoother debugging, and easier plugin management. Plus, JetBrains Toolbox benefits from better connection quality via Gateway, making remote development even smoother.",

        "pubDate": "Tue, 05 Aug 2025 13:57:48 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "In the last few TeamCity releases, we made some improvements to the Kotlin DSL. This is a summary of these enhancements.\nCustom path for Kotlin DSL files\nTeamCity has always had strict requirements regarding the directory location for Kotlin DSL files. It insisted on saving the files under the .teamcity directory, which had some drawbacks. For instance, directories starting with . are hidden by default on some operating systems. \nIt is also not very convenient to have this directory in a repository that stores DSL files only. In such cases, it would be more convenient to place all the files in the root directory instead. This would also simplify working with IntelliJ IDEA, which will be able to see the pom.xml right in the root directory and offer to open it as a Maven project.\nAll of this is possible in TeamCity since the 2024.07 version. Read more about this feature in our documentation.\nFor the sake of simplicity in the subsequent sections of this post, we’ll assume that the DSL code is stored in the .teamcity directory.\nSimplified code reuse with DSL libraries\nIf you’re employing the Kotlin DSL in several projects, you’ll notice that you’re using the same code again and again. Wouldn’t it be nice to share it somehow?\nUsually, when the need to share code arises, we recommend creating a Java library and publishing it to a Maven repository as a Maven artifact. If your company writes Java code, then these Maven repositories are likely already set up, and the process to publish new artifacts there is already familiar. \nOnce a library is published to Maven, developers can add a dependency to the DSL pom.xml file. The TeamCity server also understands these dependencies, so when it needs to generate configuration files from this DSL, it will download necessary dependencies as well.\nIf your company doesn’t have a Maven repository or if it’s too cumbersome to publish something there, TeamCity can act as a repository where you can publish your libraries with standard Maven versioning. Starting with TeamCity 2024.12, the Administration area includes a new page: DSL Libraries. This is where system administrators can manage these libraries.\n\n\n\n\nThe uploaded DSL library can then be added as a regular Maven dependency to your pom.xml.\nRead more in our documentation.\nChanges in DSL files and their impact on build reuse\nIt’s quite common to store DSL code in the main project repository in the .teamcity directory. When a new branch is created, the DSL files are also branched, allowing for running builds in branches with modified settings. However, when DSL files are stored in the same repository as the main source code, one potentially frustrating drawback emerges. \nLet’s imagine that we have a build chain of two build configurations (Run tests depends on Compile):\n\n\n\n\nSomeone then makes a commit to the .teamcity directory, which changes the settings of Run tests only. Since it’s a commit to the main repository, TeamCity computes a new revision for checkout on the agent, so when you run Run tests, it will rebuild Compile too, even though the only changes in the repository were in the DSL files.\nExperienced TeamCity users remember that there are checkout rules that allow excluding directories from checkout on the agent, and they would try to add something like this to the Compile build configuration’s checkout rules:\n-:.teamcity\nBut this would not work because internally, TeamCity always adds +:.teamcity to ensure that it doesn’t miss a revision that affects the build configuration settings.\nStarting with 2025.07, this no longer happens. Now, if .teamcity is excluded via checkout rules, it won’t be checked out on the agent and the build revision won’t be affected by commits to this directory. This allows reusing Compile builds from our example, where changes in the DSL do not affect their settings. At the same time, if DSL changes affect the build settings, a new build will be started.\nSo far, so good, but if checkout rules exclude the .teamcity directory, TeamCity will hide any changes from this directory in the builds of this build configuration. This is not ideal, as it can complicate the analysis of the build problems. \nFortunately, to bring back the changes, you just need to enable the Show settings changes in builds option on the versioned settings page:\n\n\n\n\nRead more about all the build reuse conditions in our documentation.\nMore precise changes of DSL settings in builds\nWith the Kotlin DSL, it’s not easy to determine whether a change in a .kt or .kts file actually affects a build configuration’s settings. As the DSL can be considered a collection of Kotlin files, there’s no correspondence between a Kotlin file name and a specific build configuration. \nMoreover, the entire project can be generated by a single settings.kts file. Without actually executing the DSL code, how would you understand that changes in a .kt file affect the settings of a particular build configuration?\nYou may ask why this is important. We’ve already mentioned that if the Show settings changes in builds option is enabled, the builds start showing all the changes made in the DSL on the Changes page, or in the Changes popup. These changes usually have a special icon to distinguish them from other commits:\n\n\n\n\nGiven that it is not possible to determine which DSL changes affect a specific build configuration’s settings simply by looking at the file names, TeamCity simply shows all the changes related to the .teamcity directory in all of the project’s build configurations. This can be rather distracting and was often the reason why the Show settings changes in builds option remained disabled.\nHowever, TeamCity 2025.03 introduced a significant improvement in this area. If a commit affects the .teamcity directory, then it will initially be shown as pending in all of the project’s build configurations. \nThen, when the actual builds are triggered, and the DSL is executed, TeamCity will perform an additional analysis of the settings produced by the DSL execution. If the settings generated for a build configuration are the same as in previous builds, then the DSL commits will be hidden.\nIncremental compilation of the Kotlin DSL (teamcity-configs:generate)\nIf you’re using the Kotlin DSL, you can run the DSL locally with the following command:\nmvn teamcity-configs:generate.\nThis command executes a task that is provided by the TeamCity Kotlin DSL plugin for Maven. The task will first compile the Kotlin files, then execute them, and finally generate the XML files.\nDuring the compilation phase, the task always recompiles everything, which can be time-consuming, especially if there are thousands of .kt files. Starting with 2025.07, you can enable Kotlin incremental compilation in your pom.xml file:\n<project>\n  …\n  <parent>\n    <groupId>org.jetbrains.teamcity</groupId>\n    <artifactId>configs-dsl-kotlin-parent</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n  </parent>\n\n  <properties>\n    <kotlin.compiler.incremental>true</kotlin.compiler.incremental>\n  </properties>\n\n  <repositories>\n    <repository>\n…\n</project>\nThe TeamCity Maven plugin will interpret this property and enable incremental Kotlin compilation. If properties are configured correctly, you should see the following output:\n[INFO] Generate TeamCity configs in <path to project>/target/generated-configs, format kotlin, dslDir: <path to project>\n\n[INFO] Kotlin incremental compilation enabled, compiler caches directory: <path to project>/target/kotlin-dsl-ic\nOur measurements show that incremental compilation can reduce the execution time of this task by as much as 50%!\nAdding build caches into the mix\nWe’ve improved the performance when locally generating TeamCity settings, but if you have a big DSL project where incremental compilation makes a difference, chances are you’re also running the same teamcity-configs:generate on your agents. There is often a validation build that is executed before merging changes to the default branch. \nEnabling incremental compilation can speed up this build, but only if it runs mostly on the same agents. This is because the Kotlin compiler needs caches produced by the previous compilation for incremental compilation to work. If the build runs on different agents, the caches will likely be empty, providing no benefit.\nFortunately, TeamCity comes with handy build caches. If you haven’t heard about this feature, now is a good time to try it out! \nThe typical build cache configuration in the DSL for our use case looks like this:\nfeatures {\n\n  buildCache {\n    name = \"DslCompilation-%teamcity.agent.jvm.os.name%\"\n    rules = \"\"\"\n        target/kotlin-dsl-ic\n        .m2\n    \"\"\".trimIndent()\n  }\n}\nThe corresponding Maven build step is defined as:\nsteps {\n  \n  maven {\n    goals = \"teamcity-configs:generate\"\n    runnerArgs = \"\"\"-Dmaven.repo.local=%teamcity.build.checkoutDir%/.m2\"\"\"\n    localRepoScope = MavenBuildStep.RepositoryScope.MAVEN_DEFAULT\n  }\n}\nNote that the cache name includes %teamcity.agent.jvm.os.name%. This allows using different caches for agents on different operating systems, which is important because the Kotlin compiler stores some OS specific information in the cache. Caches produced by the Windows agent won’t be used by the Kotlin compiler running on Linux. \nThe cache also includes the .m2 directory, allowing you to avoid re-downloading Maven dependencies again during the build.\nDue to additional overhead, like source code checkout or cache download, achieving a 50% performance boost with build caches on a freshly started TeamCity agent can be challenging. However, it’s still possible to experience a 20–30% improvement, which can be significant for large projects.\nConclusion\nFor your convenience, here’s a summary of the features discussed in this blog post alongside the corresponding TeamCity version in which they were introduced:\n\nCustom path to Kotlin DSL files2024.07\nDSL libraries2024.12\nMore precise changes in builds2025.03\nBetter reuse of builds2025.07\nIncremental Kotlin compilation for teamcity-configs:generate2025.07\nBuild caches2023.11\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hope that these features improve your day-to-day work as a Kotlin DSL developer. We look forward to your feedback, especially if you encounter any difficulties. Please share your experience in the comments below!\nAs always, happy building!",

When a bun.lockb or bun.lock file is present in your project, PhpStorm will automatically detect Bun and set it as the package manager. All relevant actions, such as running bun install, using context menu options for package.json, and resolving dependency suggestions, will default to Bun.\n\n\n\n\nUser experience\nParameter Info popup improvements\nPhpStorm 2025.2 introduces several improvements that make the Parameter Info popup easier to read and navigate.\n\n\n\n\nDatabases\nAbility to attach database objects to the AI chat\nThe database context you provide to the AI Assistant’s chat can now be more specific. Previously, only the whole schema could be attached. Now, you can attach the database object you need to work with – for example, a table or a view. \nTo attach a database object, type @ or # in the input field, select or type dbObject:, then select the object you want to attach from the list.\n\n\n\n\n[SQLite] WSL database file path\nPhpStorm now supports WSL file paths for SQLite database files.\nThis means that you can now access your SQLite database in WSL and work with it without the database file being locked for you. To do this, go to the Data Sources and Drivers dialog and use the following file path format: \\\\wsl$\\<os>\\home\\<username>\\<database_file_name>.sqlite. For example, \\\\wsl.localhost\\Ubuntu-24.04\\home\\john.smith\\identifier.sqlite.",

This is the reason why millions of great ideas remain little more than ideas and never end up becoming ready-to-use products. \nWe saw it as a challenge and inspiration to develop and introduce our new product, Kineto by JetBrains – a platform that helps create, deploy, and maintain ready-to-use websites and apps. \n\n\n\n\n\n    \nJoin the Waitlist\n                                                    \nFrom now on, anybody in the world will be able to effortlessly create their own personal or professional app and share it with their friends – just as easily as our phones allow us to take pictures, record videos, and share these on social media today. Why look for an existing app when you can create your own in 20 minutes? \nAs of yet, nobody has been able to develop technology capable of doing this: website constructors increase web development speeds, but they still require your input to actually build a website, and while there are generative AI platforms, these still need you to do some (vibe) coding. At this moment in time, there is no platform that allows people with no coding experience to build a ready-to-use app and actually enjoy the process of building it.\nNow, with the release of Kineto, we have taken a significant step toward making this dream a reality.\nWith Kineto, we’re building a bridge between creative people, small businesses, and no-code platforms, contributing to the emergence of a creative dev economy – a new era in which people will create their own personal web apps with minimal effort. \nThe key principle behind Kineto is no code for you at all. We and our tools take care of the coding, so you could focus on being creative. We’ve leveraged 25 years of experience building products for developers to create this technology that will help millions of people make their ideas happen – and truly enjoy the process of creation. \nToday, Kineto is perfect for creating small, “single value” applications. Whether we’re talking about a website, a plant care app, a fitness tracker, a personal blog, a day planner, or even a small quiz app – you can build them all without a single line of code. Kineto will create a fully functional app with a UI, backend, and database that can all be changed through the chat interface. Kineto needs some time to create your web app – usually it takes around 20 minutes to build the first prototype, and then it’s up to you how to improve it.\nFuture iterations of Kineto will bring even more complex and beautiful ideas to life, even taking care of hosting and suggesting helpful improvements to your apps along the way. \nLet us walk you through how Kineto works. \nIt all starts with an idea\nThe first step with Kineto is to formulate the prompt with a detailed explanation of what your app should do, and what it should look like. Every prompt is processed by Kineto and translated into appropriate functionality. You don’t need to explain every single button or provide extensive references; Kineto will think of all that for you and then propose a suitable interface and design.\n\n\n\n\nKineto helps you ship your web application\nIt’s okay if you don’t know exactly what you want your app to look like. Kineto will ask you to choose a basic design template, color scheme, and font in order to give it a solid starting point from which to build your app.\nAll you need is a prompt – and complex software architecture under the hood\nAll apps need a bit of fine-tuning. But you don’t want to write a new prompt every single time you need to make a minor change. This is where Kineto’s Meta Layer mode comes in – it lets you verify and modify functionality, user roles, and rules of your app.\nPreview your prototype\nYour prototype will be ready in ~20 minutes – it takes some time for Kineto to generate a fully functional website or web app. During this period, Kineto will create a complex app architecture and then build and test the right functionality based on your prompt.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop your app\nYou can add your desired features, rehash the design, embed AI-generated illustrations or your own images, and so much more. Make your ideas come to life!\nPublish your website or web app\nThe only step left now is to publish your app, share it, and start using it. When you’re happy with how Kineto implemented your app, share it with us so we can add it to our library of apps created by Kineto.\n\n\n\n\nThe Early Access Program is now open\nAt JetBrains, we’ve been building tools for professional developers, and now we want to offer our technologies to creators who’ve never coded – or even planned to.\nIf this describes you, we’d love for you to trial Kineto and share your experience with us. The Early Access Program is now open, and we invite you to join the waitlist to try it out for yourself. We’ll review all applications and grant free access to a select group of users with no coding experience, with priority being given to those who already know what they want to create. As a participant in our Early Access Program, you won’t just receive access to Kineto – you’ll also enjoy the full support of our team, who will assist you as you build and polish your app. \nOur goal is to help you close Kineto happy with your app – and hopefully welcome you back again later to make more.\nPlease understand that we won’t be able to provide access to all applicants in order to ensure that we can give those selected the required focus and attention.\nJoin us to build a creative dev future – together.\nJoin the Waitlist",

GPT-5는 속도와 정확도 모두 대폭 개선되었고, 가장 똑똑하고 신뢰할 수 있는 모델로 평가받고 있어요.\n  GPT-5의 '사고 과정' 알아보기!\nGPT-5의 Thinking 모델은 답변을 하기 전에 내부적으로 '사고 과정'을 먼저 생성합니다. 이 과정에서 스스로 전략을 점검하고, 실수를 인식하며, 안전 규칙을 지키도록 훈련되었어요. 덕분에 사용자의 유도나 우회 시도에도 흔들리지 않고 더 유용하고 신뢰성 높은 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다.\n \n벤치마크로 보는 GPT-5의 압도적 성능  \nGPT-5는 다양한 벤치마크에서 이전 모델들을 압도하는 성능을 보여줬습니다. 특히 복잡한 추론과 문제 해결 능력을 평가하는 벤치마크에서 두각을 나타냈는데요.\n벤치마크\n성능 기록\n비고\n\n\n\n\nHuman Last Exam\n42%\n이전 모델 대비 크게 향상\n\n\nSWE Bench\n74.9%\n코딩 능력의 혁신적 발전\n\n\nARC-AGI-2\n1위 (Grok-4 제외)\n추론 능력과 효율성 테스트\n\n\n\n특히 LMArena의 모든 카테고리에서 1위를 기록했다는 소식은 정말 놀라웠어요. 텍스트, 웹 개발, 이미지 처리, 수학, 창의력 등 분야를 가리지 않고 최고의 성능을 입증했죠. 내부 테스트에서도 'summit'이라는 코드명으로 역대 최고 점수를 받았다고 하니, 괜히 플래그십 모델이 아니라는 생각이 들었습니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nGPT-5는 복잡한 대화에서 기만적인 행동을 억제하도록 훈련되었지만, 여전히 안전 장치(guardrails)를 준수해야 합니다. 악용 사례(데이터 자동 추출, 계정 공유, 재판매 등)에 대해서는 언제든지 일시적 사용 제한이 있을 수 있습니다.\n \nGPT-5의 요금제별 사용 제한 및 특징  \nGPT-5의 강력한 기능은 챗GPT의 다양한 요금제에 따라 조금씩 다르게 적용됩니다. 무료 사용자와 유료 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)의 사용 제한 및 모델 선택 옵션에 대해 자세히 알아볼게요.\n요금제\n메시지 제한 (GPT-5)\n모델 선택\n추가 혜택\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT Free\n5시간마다 10개\nGPT-5 Thinking 1회/일\n-\n\n\nChatGPT Plus\n3시간마다 80개\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking 선택 가능 (Thinking은 주 200회 제한)\n \n\n\nChatGPT Pro/Team\n무제한 (악용 방지 정책 적용)\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking, GPT-5 Thinking Pro 선택 가능\n무제한 사용\n\n\n\n여기서 주목할 점은 GPT-5가 하나의 모델이 아니라, 여러 모델(gpt-5-main, gpt-5-thinking, mini, nano, pro 등)로 구성된 통합 시스템이라는 거예요. 기존의 GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini 모델들이 이 시스템 안으로 재편되었다고 보시면 됩니다.\nGPT-5의 컨텍스트 윈도우는 최대 40만 토큰까지 지원하고, 지식 컷오프는 2024년 9월입니다. 미니나 나노 모델은 2024년 5월 지식을 반영하고 있으니 참고하면 좋겠네요.\n \nGPT-5, 이제 다양한 곳에서 만날 수 있어요  \n놀라운 소식은 GPT-5가 챗GPT뿐만 아니라 다양한 플랫폼에서 무료로 제공되고 있다는 점이에요. 현재 Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티에서 GPT-5를 무료로 사용해볼 수 있습니다. 젠스파크에서는 GPT-5 PRO까지 사용 가능하다고 하니, 다양한 환경에서 직접 경험해보는 것도 좋은 방법일 것 같습니다.\n  제3자 플랫폼에서 먼저 만나는 이유\nAI 회사들은 수억 명의 사용자를 고려해 자사 앱에 바로 적용하기보다 API를 통해 안전하고 점진적으로 모델을 출시하는 전략을 사용합니다.\n반면 Perplexity나 젠스파크 같은 제3자 플랫폼은 여러 AI 모델을 유연하게 연결하는 구조를 갖추고 있어, 새로운 API가 공개되자마자 빠르게 통합하여 사용자에게 제공할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5가 출시되면서 기존 모델들이 단계적으로 은퇴합니다. GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o4-mini 등이 이에 해당하는데요. 만약 기존 대화창을 열면 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 버전으로 전환된다고 하니, 예전 대화를 이어갈 때 답변이 달라질 수 있다는 점을 염두에 두어야 해요.\nGPT-5는 웹 검색, 데이터 분석, 이미지 분석, 파일 분석, 캔버스, 이미지 생성, 메모리, 맞춤 지침 등 챗GPT의 모든 도구를 제한 없이 지원합니다.\n \n음성 모델의 대대적인 업그레이드!  ️\nGPT-5와 함께 챗GPT의 음성 모델도 대폭 개선되었어요. 이제 더 자연스럽고 똑똑하게 대화할 수 있게 되었는데요. 특히 가장 큰 변화는 GPTs에서 고급 음성 모델을 바로 사용할 수 있게 되었다는 점입니다.\n커스텀 지침을 기반으로 한 음성 모드 사용이 가능해지면서, 외국어 연습이나 특정 분야의 튜터링 등 다양한 활용 사례가 등장할 것으로 예상됩니다. 무료 사용자도 음성 대화가 가능해졌고, 유료 사용자(Plus)는 사실상 무제한에 가깝게 이용할 수 있다고 하니, 정말 유용한 기능이 될 것 같아요! 참고로, 현재 보이스 모드는 여전히 GPT-4o 기반이라고 합니다.\n \nAPI 가격과 모델 상세 정보  \nGPT-5의 API 가격은 꽤 합리적으로 책정된 것 같아요. 100만 토큰 기준으로 모델별 가격을 정리해보겠습니다.\n모델\n입력(Input)\n출력(Output)\n\n\n\n\nGPT-5\n$1.25\n$10.00\n\n\nGPT-5-mini\n$0.25\n$2.00\n\n\nGPT-5-nano\n$0.05\n$0.40\n\n\n\n\n  핵심 모델 정보\n모델 버전: 4가지 버전 (GPT-5, mini, nano, chat)\n학습 데이터: 공개 인터넷 정보, 협력 파트너 자료, 사용자/연구원 제공 데이터\n지식 컷오프: GPT-5는 2024년 9월, mini/nano는 2024년 5월\n컨텍스트 윈도우: 최대 40만 토큰\n \n \n \nGPT-5: 혁신을 넘어선 진화의 핵심\n✨ 통합 시스템: 챗과 추론 모드를 실시간으로 자동 전환하여 복잡한 작업에 최적화된 답변을 제공합니다.\n  압도적 성능: Human Last Exam 42%, SWE Bench 74.9% 등 주요 벤치마크에서 역대 최고 성능을 기록했습니다.\n  안전성 강화:\nsafe-completions 훈련을 통해 환각, 아첨 감소 및 기만 방지 성능을 높였습니다.\n ‍  접근성 확장: Cursor, 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등에서 무료 사용이 가능해졌고, GPTs에서 음성 모델을 바로 활용할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5는 단순히 성능을 개선한 것이 아닌, AI의 새로운 활용 방식을 제시합니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: GPT-5가 무료로 제공되나요?\nA: 네, ChatGPT의 무료 계정에서도 일부 메시지 제한과 함께 GPT-5를 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한, Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등 일부 외부 플랫폼에서도 무료로 이용 가능합니다.\nQ: GPT-5를 쓰려면 별도로 선택해야 하나요?\nA: 유료 요금제 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)는 모델 선택기에서 GPT-5를 수동으로 선택할 수 있습니다. 하지만 기본적으로는 모든 로그인 사용자에게 새로운 GPT-5가 기본 모델로 자동 적용됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 Thinking 모드는 무엇인가요?\nA: GPT-5가 복잡한 요청에 대해 답변하기 전에 더 깊은 추론을 적용하는 모드입니다. 코딩, 과학, 금융 분석 등 정밀한 분석이 필요한 작업에 특히 유용하며, 유료 요금제 사용자에게 제공됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 출시로 기존 대화가 사라지나요?\nA: 아니요, 기존 대화는 그대로 유지됩니다. 다만, 이전 모델을 사용했던 대화창을 열 경우 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 모델로 전환되어 이어서 대화하게 됩니다.\n \n오늘은 이렇게 GPT-5에 대해 자세히 알아보았는데요. 사실 GPT-5의 등장은 단순한 기술 발전이 아니라, 우리가 AI를 활용하는 방식 자체를 한 단계 끌어올리는 중요한 계기가 될 것 같아요. 특히 복잡한 문제 해결이나 창의적인 작업에서 얼마나 놀라운 결과를 보여줄지 정말 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n\n.single-summary-card-container {\nfont-family: 'Noto Sans KR', sans-serif;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\npadding: 20px 10px;\nbackground-color: #fce4ec;\nmargin: 20px 0;\n}\n.single-summary-card {\nwidth: 100%;\nmax-width: 700px;\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nborder-radius: 12px;\nbox-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);\npadding: 25px;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\noverflow: hidden;\nborder: 1px solid #ce93d8;\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-bottom: 2px solid #8e24aa;\npadding-bottom: 12px;\nmargin-bottom: 12px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 34px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin-right: 14px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 26px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin: 0;\nline-height: 1.3;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nflex-grow: 1;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\njustify-content: space-around;\nfont-size: 17px;\nline-height: 1.65;\ncolor: #444;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content strong {\ncolor: #7b1fa2;\nfont-weight: 600;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .highlight {\nbackground-color: #fff9c4;\npadding: 2px 6px;\nborder-radius: 3px;\nfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\nbackground-color: #f3e5f5;\npadding: 6px 10px;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\ntext-align: center;\nmargin-top: 5px;\ncolor: #4a148c;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 14px;\ncolor: #777;\ntext-align: center;\npadding-top: 12px;\nborder-top: 1px dashed #e1bee7;\nmargin-top: auto;\n}\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 18px;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 30px;\nmargin-right: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 22px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 15px;\nline-height: 1.6;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 8px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 5px 8px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 13px;\npadding-top: 10px;\n}\n}\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 15px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 28px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 20px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 14px;\nline-height: 1.55;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 4px 6px;\nfont-size: 0.8em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 12px;\npadding-top: 8px;\n}\n}",

현상입니다. 챗봇은 사실을 정확하게 제시하기보다는, 방대한 학습 데이터에서 찾은 문장 패턴을 기반으로 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">그럴듯하게 들리는 답변을 '창작'</span>하는 데 특화되어 있어요. 마치 능청스러운 이야기꾼 같다고 할까요? 그래서 때로는 있지도 않은 정보를 마치 실제 사실인 것처럼 자신 있게 이야기하기도 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">실제로 제 지인 중 한 명이 해외여행을 앞두고 비자 정보를 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"한국 여권 소지자가 태국에 갈 때 비자가 필요해?\"라고 물었더니, 챗봇은 \"네, 90일 관광 비자를 미리 발급받아야 합니다.\"라고 답했습니다. 하지만 태국은 한국 여권 소지자에 대해 30일 무비자 입국을 허용하고 있죠. 이 지인은 챗봇 답변을 믿고 비자 발급을 알아보다가, 다행히 다른 친구의 조언으로 잘못된 정보라는 걸 알게 되었습니다. 만약 공항에 갔다가 입국 거부라도 당했다면 여행을 망칠 뻔했죠. 챗봇은 검색처럼 정보의 출처를 명시하지 않기에 이런 실수가 더 위험하게 다가옵니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

        "contentSnippet": "티스토리, 워드프레스? 플랫폼 이전, 정말 당신의 수익을 바꿔줄까요? 워드프레스로의 이전을 고민하는 분들을 위해 현실적인 조언과 블로그 성공의 본질을 5단계로 나누어 심도 있게 짚어드립니다.\n\n\n \n최근 티스토리의 애드센스 광고 정책 변화와 카카오 분사 이슈로 뒤숭숭하시죠? 저도 마찬가지입니다. 많은 분들이 정든 티스토리를 떠나 워드프레스 같은 새로운 플랫폼으로의 이전을 심각하게 고민하고 계신 것 같아요. 하지만 새로운 시작에 대한 막연한 기대감만으로 섣불리 움직이기 전에, 우리 잠시 멈춰서 냉정하게 현실을 한번 돌아보는 건 어떨까요?  \n \n1. 플랫폼 이전, 그 전에 '나'를 진단하세요  \n플랫폼을 탓하기 전에, 내 블로그의 현주소를 정확히 파악하는 것이 우선입니다. 다음 질문들에 솔직하게 답해보세요.\n나의 수익은 얼마인가?: 구글 애드센스 수익이 하루에 꾸준히 최소 5달러를 넘기고 있나요? 이 기준을 넘지 못했다면, 플랫폼보다는 콘텐츠나 SEO 전략에 문제가 있을 확률이 큽니다.\n나의 방문자 수는?: 하루 평균 방문자 수가 100명도 채 되지 않나요? 100개의 글을 발행했는데도 방문자가 늘지 않는다면, 글의 방향성이나 키워드 전략을 점검해야 합니다.\n나의 트래픽 출처는?: 방문자의 대부분이 어디서 오나요? 검색 유입이 아닌 SNS나 직접 유입이 대부분이라면, SEO에 대한 이해가 부족하다는 신호입니다.\n이 진단에서 긍정적인 답변을 하기 어렵다면, 플랫폼 이전은 밑 빠진 독에 물 붓기가 될 수 있습니다. 지금 필요한 것은 새로운 집이 아니라, 집을 채울 '가구(콘텐츠)'를 제대로 만드는 법을 배우는 것입니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n수익이 없는 상태에서 워드프레스로 이전하면 호스팅 비용, 도메인 비용 등 연간 수십만 원의 추가 지출만 발생합니다. '일단 시작하면 어떻게든 되겠지'라는 막연한 기대는 금물입니다.\n \n2. 워드프레스의 '자유'와 '책임'  \n워드프레스의 가장 큰 장점은 '자유도'입니다. 하지만 이 자유에는 상당한 책임과 비용이 따릅니다. 티스토리처럼 알아서 해주는 것은 아무것도 없습니다. 모든 것을 직접 관리해야 하죠.\n구체적인 비용과 책임의 무게:\n항목\n예상 비용 (연간)\n관리 포인트\n\n\n\n\n호스팅\n12만원 ~ 24만원\n서버 속도, 트래픽 관리, 보안\n\n\n도메인\n1.5만원 ~ 2만원\n매년 갱신, DNS 설정\n\n\n유료 테마/플러그인\n5만원 ~ 20만원+\n주기적인 업데이트, 호환성 충돌 해결\n\n\n\n비용뿐만이 아닙니다. '하얀 화면의 공포'라 불리는 업데이트 오류, 갑자기 느려지는 사이트 속도, 끊임없이 들어오는 스팸 댓글과 해킹 시도 등 기술적인 문제에 직접 대응해야 합니다. 글쓰기보다 사이트 관리에 더 많은 시간을 쏟게 될 수도 있습니다.\n  실용적인 방안\n워드프레스를 시작한다면 처음에는 비용을 최소화하세요. 월 5천원 내외의 저렴한 공유 호스팅으로 시작하고, GeneratePress나 Kadence 같은 가볍고 빠른 무료 테마를 사용하세요. 필수 플러그인(SEO, 보안, 캐시) 몇 가지만 설치하여 관리 부담을 줄이는 것이 현명합니다.\n \n3. 한국 시장의 특수성을 이해하세요  \n\"워드프레스는 구글 SEO에 최적화되어 있으니 무조건 유리하다\"는 말은 반은 맞고 반은 틀립니다. 한국은 네이버의 검색 점유율이 여전히 높은 특수한 시장입니다. 내 블로그의 주력 타겟 독자들이 네이버를 통해 정보를 얻는다면, 구글 SEO에만 '올인'하는 전략은 위험할 수 있습니다.\n\n네이버와 구글, 다른 공략법:\n네이버: 최신성과 트렌드가 중요한 노출이 핵심입니다. 티스토리는 네이버 웹마스터 도구와의 연동이 원활하고, 비교적 노출에 유리한 측면이 있습니다.\n구글: 전문성과 신뢰도를 바탕으로 한 '정보성 콘텐츠'를 선호합니다. 잘 구축된 워드프레스 사이트는 기술적 SEO 설정을 통해 구글에 내 블로그의 전문성을 어필하기에 더 용이합니다.\n따라서 실용적인 대안은 '투 트랙 전략'입니다. 네이버 검색 노출에 아직 강점이 있는 티스토리는 그대로 유지하면서, 구글 검색과 브랜딩을 위한 워드프레스 사이트를 별도로 개설하여 함께 운영하는 방식입니다. 모든 계란을 한 바구니에 담지 않는 것이죠.\n  실용적인 방안: 투 트랙 전략 실행법\n플랫폼을 '이사'가 아닌 '확장'의 개념으로 접근해보세요. 예를 들어, 워드프레스에 '2024년 연말정산 총정리'라는 깊이 있는 핵심 글을 발행했다면, 티스토리에는 '연말정산 부양가족 등록 방법', '신용카드 소득공제 꿀팁' 등 세부 주제의 글을 발행하고 워드프레스의 핵심 글로 링크를 걸어주는 방식입니다. 티스토리가 네이버 유입을 위한 전초기지 역할을, 워드프레스가 전문적인 브랜딩과 구글 유입을 위한 본진 역할을 하게 됩니다.\n \n4. '그릇'이 아닌 '음식'에 집중하세요  \n결국 블로그의 성패는 플랫폼이라는 '그릇'이 아닌, 그 안에 담긴 '음식', 즉 콘텐츠와 SEO 전략에 달려있습니다. 지금 당장 당신이 실천할 수 있는 현실적인 방안은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n'일기'가 아닌 '정보'를 쓰세요: \"제주도 여행 후기\"가 아니라, \"50만원으로 즐기는 커플 제주도 2박 3일 코스 (숨은 맛집 포함)\"처럼 독자의 문제를 해결해주는 해결책 중심의 글을 작성하세요. 독자의 '검색 의도'를 파악하고 그에 맞는 답을 제공하는 것이 핵심입니다.\n키워드 도구와 친해지세요: '블랙키위', '키워드마스터' 같은 무료 키워드 도구를 활용하여 사람들이 무엇을 검색하는지, 경쟁은 얼마나 치열한지 분석하는 습관을 들이세요. 월간 검색량은 1000 이상이면서 블로그 문서 수는 1000 미만인 '황금 키워드'를 찾는 연습을 꾸준히 하세요.\n내부 링크로 거미줄을 만드세요: 발행한 글들을 서로 연결하는 내부 링크 작업을 통해 독자들이 내 블로그에 더 오래 머물게 하고, 검색엔진에게 내 블로그가 전문성이 있다는 신호를 보내세요. '연말정산'이라는 주제로 글을 썼다면, 과거에 썼던 '신용카드 소득공제' 글과 링크를 연결해주는 식입니다.\n제목과 서론에 승부를 거세요: 검색 결과 화면에서 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 매력적인 제목을 짓는 연습을 하세요. \"연말정산 하는 법\" 보다는 \"클릭 한 번으로 13월의 월급 2배 받는 연말정산 비법\"이 훨씬 클릭하고 싶어집니다.\n \n5. 당신의 레벨에 맞는 현명한 로드맵  ️\n자, 그럼 이제 우리는 무엇을 해야 할까요? 섣부른 플랫폼 이전으로 시간과 비용을 낭비하기보다는, 현재 자신의 상황에 맞는 전략을 세우는 것이 중요합니다.\n\nLv.1 초보 블로거 (수익 0원 ~ 월 10만원): 당신의 미션은 '수익'이 아니라 '기본기 훈련'입니다. 앞으로 3~6개월간 키워드 기반의 양질의 글 50개 발행, 일 방문자 100명 달성을 목표로 티스토리에서 훈련하세요.\nLv.2 중급 블로거 (월 30만원 이상 안정적 수익): 이제 '확장'을 고민할 때입니다. 티스토리의 상위 노출된 효자 포스팅 몇 개를 워드프레스로 옮겨 심화 콘텐츠로 발전시켜보세요. 3개월간 두 플랫폼을 병행하며 데이터 추이를 분석한 후, 완전 이전 여부를 결정해도 늦지 않습니다.\nLv.3 워드프레스 체험 희망자: 돈 쓰지 말고 연습부터 하세요. 'LocalWP' 같은 로컬 서버 환경 프로그램을 설치하면 내 컴퓨터에서 무료로 워드프레스를 마음껏 테스트할 수 있습니다.\n플랫폼은 당신의 성공을 보장해주지 않습니다. 당신의 노력과 전략이 성공을 만듭니다. 지금 당신이 글을 쓰고 있는 바로 그곳에서 콘텐츠의 깊이를 더하고, SEO의 기본기를 탄탄하게 다지는 것에 집중해 보세요. 그것이 가장 확실하고 빠른 성공의 길일 수 있습니다.\n \n \n티스토리 탈출? 5단계 자가진단\n1. 현실 점검: 나의 현재 수익은 얼마인가? (하루 5달러 이상?)\n2. 비용 분석: 워드프레스의 유지 비용을 감당할 수 있는가?\n3. 시장 이해: 네이버와 구글, 나의 타겟 시장은 어디인가?\n4. 본질 집중: 플랫폼 탓 대신, 콘텐츠와 SEO에 집중하고 있는가?\n5. 로드맵 수립: 현재 내 수준에 맞는 다음 스텝은 무엇인가?\n플랫폼 이전보다 중요한 것은 내실을 다지는 것입니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 티스토리에서 수익이 안 나면 워드프레스로 가도 정말 소용없나요?\nA: 네, 그럴 가능성이 매우 높습니다. 수익의 핵심은 플랫폼이 아닌 '콘텐츠의 가치'와 'SEO'입니다. 좋은 콘텐츠는 어떤 플랫폼에서도 결국 빛을 발합니다. 반면, 경쟁력 없는 콘텐츠는 비싼 워드프레스에서도 수익을 내기 어렵고 오히려 비용 부담만 커질 수 있습니다.\nQ: 워드프레스는 무조건 구글 SEO에 유리한가요?\nA: 워드프레스가 다양한 SEO 플러그인을 통해 세밀한 설정이 가능한 것은 사실이지만, 이것이 자동으로 상위 노출을 보장하지는 않습니다. SEO의 기본 원리(양질의 콘텐츠, 키워드 전략, 백링크 등)를 이해하고 적용하는 것이 훨씬 중요합니다. 티스토리에서도 이 원리들을 적용하면 충분히 구글 상위 노출이 가능합니다.\nQ: 그럼 언제 워드프레스로 이전하는 것이 좋을까요?\nA: 티스토리에서 월 30~50만 원 이상의 안정적인 수익 파이프라인을 구축했을 때, 그리고 블로그를 통해 더 큰 사업(예: 강의, 컨설팅, 전자책 판매 등)으로 확장하고 싶을 때가 가장 좋은 시기입니다. 이때는 워드프레스의 강력한 확장성이 큰 무기가 될 수 있습니다.\n혹시 더 궁금한 점이 있으시거나 다른 의견이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요. 함께 고민하고 성장해나가면 좋겠습니다!  \n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"티스토리에서 수익이 안 나면 워드프레스로 가도 정말 소용없나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  네, 그럴 가능성이 매우 높습니다. 수익의 핵심은 플랫폼이 아닌 '콘텐츠의 가치'와 'SEO'입니다. 좋은 콘텐츠는 어떤 플랫폼에서도 결국 빛을 발합니다. 반면, 경쟁력 없는 콘텐츠는 비싼 워드프레스에서도 수익을 내기 어렵고 오히려 비용 부담만 커질 수 있습니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워드프레스는 무조건 구글 SEO에 유리한가요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  워드프레스가 다양한 SEO 플러그인을 통해 세밀한 설정이 가능한 것은 사실이지만, 이것이 자동으로 상위 노출을 보장하지는 않습니다.

Google NotebookLM의 놀라운 기능들 ✨\nGoogle NotebookLM은 Google Labs에서 개발한 AI 기반의 혁신적인 도구입니다. 이 도구는 단순히 검색 결과를 찾아주는 것을 넘어, 사용자가 업로드한 문서를 기반으로 상호작용하며 정보를 분석하고 정리하는 데 특화되어 있어요. Google의 강력한 AI 모델인 Gemini를 활용해 복잡한 자료를 명확하게 바꿔주고, 여러분의 연구와 학습 과정을 효율적으로 만들어주는 온라인 서비스라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\nNotebookLM은 여러분의 작업 효율을 극대화할 수 있도록 다양한 기능을 제공하고 있습니다. 어떤 기능들이 있는지 자세히 알아볼까요?\n소스 업로드 및 분석: PDF, 웹사이트, Google 문서, 슬라이드 등 다양한 형식의 소스를 올릴 수 있어요. 놀랍게도 최대 50개의 소스, 총 2,500만 단어까지 한 번에 처리할 수 있다고 하니, 방대한 양의 자료도 걱정 없겠죠!\n요약 및 설명 생성: 업로드된 콘텐츠를 바탕으로 핵심 내용을 요약하고, 상세한 설명을 생성해 줍니다. 특히, 답변의 출처를 원본 소스에 대한 인용으로 제공해 줘서 정보의 신뢰성을 확실하게 보장합니다.\n오디오 오버뷰: 2024년 9월에 출시되어 큰 주목을 받았던 기능이에요. 문서를 대화형 팟캐스트 형식으로 요약해 주기 때문에, 단순히 읽는 것보다 훨씬 재미있고 쉽게 내용을 파악할 수 있답니다.\n형식 변환: 소스 문서를 학습 가이드, 브리핑 문서, 마인드맵 등 다양한 형식으로 변환해줘요. 복잡한 자료를 내가 원하는 형태로 즉시 바꿔주니, 콘텐츠 기획자나 학생들에게 정말 유용하겠죠.\n채팅 및 질문: 마치 친구와 대화하듯 노트북과 채팅하며 궁금한 점을 물어볼 수 있어요. 복잡한 추론이 필요한 질문에도 정확하고 신뢰성 있는 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n이렇게 NotebookLM은 아이디어를 다듬고 정리하는 데 특화된 강력한 도구랍니다. 더 높은 한도와 프리미엄 기능을 제공하는 기업용 버전(NotebookLM Plus)도 있으니 참고하시면 좋을 것 같아요.\n  알아두세요!\nNotebookLM은 업로드된 소스 자료에 근거해 답변을 생성하기 때문에, 잘못된 정보나 '환각' 현상(Hallucination)이 나타날 확률이 현저히 낮아요. 이 점이 NotebookLM의 가장 큰 장점 중 하나랍니다.\n \n2. 동영상 개요 기능, 한국어 사용자의 도전과제 ⚠️\n 최근 NotebookLM의 동영상 개요 기능이 처음 공개되었을 때, 저도 정말 기대가 컸어요. 그런데 사용해보니 한 가지 큰 벽에 부딪히더라고요. 바로 이 기능이 공식적으로 영문 콘텐츠에만 최적화되어 있다는 점이었죠. \n \n 음성과 슬라이드에 나타나는 텍스트는 영문으로만 생성되어, 우리말 콘텐츠를 만드는 크리에이터나 기획자 입장에서는 정말 답답할 수밖에 없죠. 이 좋은 기능을 그림의 떡처럼 바라만 봐야 하는 상황이었답니다.\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nAI가 만들어준 결과물이라고 해서 맹신하면 안 됩니다. 특히 복잡하거나 전문적인 내용을 다룰 때는 AI가 놓친 맥락이나 세부 사항이 없는지 반드시 최종 확인하는 과정이 필요해요.\n \n3. AI STUDIO를 활용한 한국어 최적화 가이드의 핵심 원리  \n그럼 이제부터 AI STUDIO의 맞춤 설정을 활용해 Google NotebookLM의 동영상 개요 기능을 우리말에 맞게 '길들이는' 방법을 알려드릴게요. 핵심은 AI에게 우리가 원하는 결과물을 명확하게 지시하는 세 가지 원칙을 적용하는 것입니다. 이 원칙만 잘 이해하면 여러분의 한국어 문서도 전문적인 영상 개요로 재탄생할 수 있어요!\n이 세 가지 핵심 원칙을 아래 표로 정리해 보았습니다.\n핵심 원칙\n상세 내용\n\n\n\n\n100% 한국어 현지화\n음성, 슬라이드, 자막 등 영상의 모든 요소를 한국어로만 제공하고, 기술 고유명사를 제외한 외국어 사용을 엄격히 금지합니다. 예시 또한 한국의 상황과 문화에 맞게 구성하여 몰입감을 높이는 것이 핵심입니다.\n\n\n시각적 디자인 강화\n텍스트만 나열하는 대신, 각 슬라이드 내용에 맞는 [아이콘]이나 [인포그래픽] 등을 구체적으로 제안하도록 지시합니다. 또한, 핵심 키워드는 굵게 처리하고, 긍정/부정적 내용을 색상(파란색, 빨간색)으로 구분하여 메시지를 직관적으로 전달하게 합니다.\n\n\n음성 나레이션 전달력\n나레이션 스크립트를 작성할 때, 딱딱한 기계음이 아닌 전문가의 신뢰감과 친근한 어조를 동시에 갖추도록 유도합니다. 중요한 내용 앞뒤에 (잠시停)과 같은 쉼표시를 넣어 강조 효과를 더하고 시청자가 내용을 소화할 시간을 제공합니다.\n\n\n\n \n핵심 내용 한눈에 보기  \n지금까지 설명드린 내용을 한눈에 보기 쉽게 요약해 보았습니다. 이 카드만 저장해 두셔도 AI STUDIO를 활용하는 데 큰 도움이 될 거예요.\n \n한국어 최적화 가이드 핵심 요약\n✨ 현지화: 모든 요소를 100% 한국어로! 문화적 배경에 맞는 예시를 활용해 몰입감을 높이세요.\n  디자인: 시각적 요소와 색상으로 강조! [아이콘]이나 [인포그래픽]을 명시하고, 중요한 내용은 파란색 또는 빨간색으로 구분해 메시지를 명확하게 전달하세요.\n ️ 전달력: 전문가적이면서 친근한 어조! (잠시후)과 같은 쉼표시를 활용해 자연스러운 흐름을 만드세요.\n이 지침을 활용하면 NotebookLM으로 최적화된 한국어 영상 개요를 만들 수 있습니다.\n \n4. AI STUDIO 맞춤 설정 지침 다운로드  \n위에 설명드린 핵심 원리를 직접 적용할 수 있는 맞춤 설정 지침 전문을 파일로 준비했습니다. 이 파일을 다운로드하여 AI STUDIO의 '맞춤 설정' 영역에 붙여넣기만 하면 됩니다. 이제 여러분의 한국어 문서도 전문가가 만든 것처럼 체계적인 영상 개요로 재탄생할 수 있습니다.\n\n    \n\n    \n노트북 LM 영상 개요 한글화 지침.zip\n0.00MB\n\n\n 사용법\n그림과 같이 동영상 개요 - 맞춤설정 에서 첨부한 지침을 붙여넣기 하면됩니다.\n단, 기본값이 영문 강제 설정이라..... 가끔씩 한글화가 안되는 경우가 있습니다.\n \n\n\n \n결과물\n\n\n\n \n \n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Google NotebookLM의 동영상 개요 기능은 한국어를 지원하나요?\nA: 현재 정식 기능으로는 한국어 음성 및 슬라이더 생성을 지원하지 않습니다. 하지만 AI STUDIO의 맞춤 설정 지침을 활용하면 한국어 영상 개요를 생성할 수 있습니다.\nQ: AI STUDIO 맞춤 설정 지침의 핵심은 무엇인가요?\nA: '100% 한국어 현지화', '시각적 디자인 및 텍스트 효과 강화', '음성 나레이션 및 전달력' 세 가지 원칙을 바탕으로, AI에게 한국어 영상에 최적화된 개요를 생성하도록 구체적으로 지시하는 것입니다.\nQ: 지침에 따라 생성된 개요를 수정해야 할까요?\nA: 네, AI가 생성한 결과물은 항상 초안으로 간주하고, 최종 사용 전에 내용을 꼼꼼하게 검토하고 수정하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 사실 관계나 어색한 표현이 없는지 확인해야 합니다.\n\n\n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"Google NotebookLM의 동영상 개요 기능은 한국어를 지원하나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  현재 정식 기능으로는 한국어 음성 및 슬라이더 생성을 지원하지 않습니다. 하지만 AI STUDIO의 맞춤 설정 지침을 활용하면 한국어 영상 개요를 생성할 수 있습니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"AI STUDIO 맞춤 설정 지침의 핵심은 무엇인가요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  '100% 한국어 현지화', '시각적 디자인 및 텍스트 효과 강화', '음성 나레이션 및 전달력' 세 가지 원칙을 바탕으로, AI에게 한국어 영상에 최적화된 개요를 생성하도록 구체적으로 지시하는 것입니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"지침에 따라 생성된 개요를 수정해야 할까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  네, AI가 생성한 결과물은 항상 초안으로 간주하고, 최종 사용 전에 내용을 꼼꼼하게 검토하고 수정하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 사실 관계나 어색한 표현이 없는지 확인해야 합니다.\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }",

Google AI Studio에서 제공하는 생성형 AI 기반의 앱 개발 도구인데요. 쉽게 말해, 우리가 \"이런 앱 만들어줘!\" 하고 자연어로 설명하면, AI가 데이터 구조 설계부터 화면 디자인, 기능 코딩까지 알아서 다 해주는 혁신적인 도구예요.\n솔직히 앱 하나 만들려면 React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 같은 복잡한 기술들을 배워야 해서 시작도 전에 포기하는 경우가 많잖아요. 하지만 제미나이 앱 빌더는 이 모든 최신 기술을 내부적으로 사용하면서도, 사용자는 전혀 알 필요가 없다는 게 가장 놀라운 점이에요. 마치 자동차 엔진의 원리를 몰라도 운전할 수 있는 것처럼요!\nAI가 사용하는 최신 기술 살짝 엿보기\nReact (리액트): 화면을 '레고 블록(컴포넌트)'처럼 여러 개의 독립적인 부품으로 나누어 조립하는 방식이에요. 할 일 목록, 할 일 추가 버튼 등이 각각의 블록처럼 독립적으로 작동해서 한 곳에 오류가 생겨도 다른 곳에 영향을 주지 않죠.\nTypeScript (타입스크립트): 코드의 '맞춤법 검사기' 같은 역할을 해요. 숫자만 입력해야 하는 곳에 문자를 넣으면 \"이거 타입이 안 맞아요!\" 하고 미리 알려줘서 버그를 줄여준답니다.\nTailwind CSS (테일윈드 CSS): 미리 만들어진 디자인 조각들을 조합해서 빠르고 세련되게 앱을 꾸며주는 도구예요. 덕분에 디자인 감각이 없어도 깔끔한 앱을 만들 수 있어요.\n이런 복잡한 기술들을 제미나이가 알아서 처리해주니, 우리는 아이디어만 있으면 할 일 관리 도구, 재미있는 게임, AI 챗봇 등 상상하는 모든 것을 몇 분 만에 현실로 만들 수 있습니다. 정말 대단하지 않나요?\n앱 빌더 시작하기: 화면 구성 및 기본 사용법\n자, 그럼 함께 제미나이 앱 빌더를 사용해볼까요? 먼저 인터넷 브라우저에서 Google AI Studio 홈페이지로 접속해주세요. 구글 계정 로그인은 필수입니다!\n로그인 후 왼쪽 메뉴에서 네 번째 '빌드' 메뉴를 클릭하면 앱 빌더의 세계로 들어갈 수 있습니다. 처음에는 여러 템플릿과 쇼케이스가 보일 텐데요, 우리는 빈 도화지에서 시작하기 위해 'Empty' 템플릿을 클릭해볼게요.\n화면은 크게 세 부분으로 나뉩니다.\n코드 어시스턴트 (왼쪽): 제미나이와 대화하며 앱 개발을 요청하는 곳입니다.\n코드 편집기 (가운데): AI가 생성한 코드를 직접 보거나 수정할 수 있는 곳입니다.\n미리보기 (오른쪽): 만들어지고 있는 앱의 실제 모습을 실시간으로 확인하는 곳입니다.\n알아두세요!\n코드 어시스턴트 영역의 'Checkpoint' 기능은 개발 과정을 저장하는 스냅샷이에요. 코드를 수정하다 문제가 생겼을 때, 이전 체크포인트로 쉽게 돌아갈 수 있어서 정말 유용하답니다. 단, 페이지를 나가면 체크포인트는 사라지니 주의하세요!\n실전! 앱 만들어보기\n백문이 불여일견이죠? 지금부터 저와 함께 3가지 앱을 직접 만들어 보겠습니다. 간단한 실용적인 앱부터 이미지로 게임을 만들고, 기존의 젬(Gem) 지침을 챗봇으로 변환하는 과정까지 단계별로 따라오시면 금방 감을 잡으실 수 있을 거예요!\n \n1. 할 일 관리(To-do) 앱 만들기\n가장 기본적이면서도 실용적인 앱인 할 일 관리 앱부터 만들어 볼게요.\n1단계: 첫 번째 요청하기\n우선, 어떤 앱을 만들고 싶은지 명확하고 구체적으로 요청하는 것이 중요해요. 코드 어시스턴트 대화창에 필요한 기능을 모두 담아 이렇게 입력해 보겠습니다.\n\"할 일을 추가하고 완료 상태를 체크할 수 있는 간단한 할 일 관리 앱을 만들어주세요. 할 일 제목, 설명, 우선순위, 완료 여부를 관리해야 하고, 할 일 목록을 볼 수 있어야 합니다.\"\n2단계: AI의 마법 확인하기\n정말 놀랍게도, 2분도 채 되지 않아 AI가 모든 코드를 작성하고 오른쪽 미리보기 화면에 완전한 할 일 관리 앱을 보여줍니다. 할 일 추가, 목록 관리, 완료 체크, 삭제 기능까지 완벽하게 구현된 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n3단계: 디테일 수정하기\n기본 기능은 완벽하지만, 디자인이 조금 아쉽네요. 다시 대화창에 추가 요청을 해볼게요.\n\"할 일 추가 버튼 색상을 녹색으로 바꿔주고, 할 일 제목 앞에 내용에 맞는 이모지를 추가해줘.\"\n할일 관리앱 예시 바로가기\n \n2. 버블 슈터 게임 만들기\n이번엔 좀 더 재미있는 게임을 만들어 볼까요? 이번에는 텍스트가 아닌 이미지를 활용하는 방법입니다.\n1단계: 이미지로 요청하기\n인터넷에서 마음에 드는 '버블 슈터' 게임 스크린샷을 찾아 업로드한 후, 아주 간단하게 요청합니다.\n\"이 이미지와 같은 버블 슈터 캐주얼 게임을 만들어줘.\"\n2단계: 게임 플레이 및 개선\n몇 분 뒤, 스크린샷과 제목만으로 바로 플레이가 가능한 수준의 게임이 완성되었습니다! 여기서 멈추지 않고 게임을 더 재미있게 만들어 볼게요.\n\"공을 좀 더 입체적으로 디자인하고, 공이 터질 때 폭발 효과를 추가해줘.\"\n버블 슈터 게임 예시 바로가기\n알아두세요!\n한 번에 너무 많은 것을 요청하기보다는, 이렇게 단계별로 조금씩 개선하고 수정하는 방식이 훨씬 안정적이고 좋은 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n \n3. 나만의 AI 코딩 도우미 챗봇 만들기\n마지막으로, 제가 실제로 만들어 사용 중인 '젬(Gem) 지침'을 안정적인 독립 앱으로 만들어 보겠습니다. 코딩 초보자가 만들고 싶은 앱을 말하면, 개발에 필요한 초기 질문 10개를 뽑아주는 챗봇이에요.\n \n2025.08.03 - [AI, 미래기술/AI 챗봇 및 지침 무료 배포] - 막막한 코딩, 이제 그만! AI 가 만들어주는 10가지 초기 개발 질문\n \n1단계: 지침을 앱으로 변환하기\n기존에 사용하던 젬 지침 전체를 복사해서 앱 빌더에 붙여넣고, 그 앞에 우리가 만들고 싶은 앱의 형태와 목적을 명확하게 설명하는 문장을 추가합니다.\n\"아래 젬 지침의 작동원리를 기반으로, 카카오톡 대화방 디자인의 채팅으로 사용자와 챗봇의 질의응답을 통해 바이브 코딩 빌더에게 할 초기 질문 10가지를 알려주는 앱을 만들어줘.\"\n[여기에 기존 젬 지침 전문 붙여넣기]\n2단계: 테스트 및 디버깅\n잠시 후 카카오톡을 닮은 챗봇이 만들어졌습니다. 바로 테스트를 해볼게요. \"테트리스 게임\"이라고 입력했는데, 전혀 관계없는 질문이 나왔습니다. AI가 아직 제 의도를 완벽히 파악하지 못한 거죠.\n3단계: 구체적인 예시로 AI 가르치기\n이럴 땐 구체적인 예시를 들어주는 것이 가장 효과적입니다. 이렇게 다시 요청해볼게요.\n\"예를 들어, '테트리스 게임'이라고 입력하면 다음 응답은 테트리스 게임과 관련된 추가 질문이어야 해.\"\n바이브코딩 아이디어 챗봇 예시 바로가기\n제미나이 '지침' vs 앱 빌더, 뭐가 다를까?\n이쯤 되면 \"그냥 제미나이 채팅에서 '지침' 기능을 쓰는 거랑 뭐가 다르지?\" 하고 궁금해하실 텐데요. 결론부터 말씀드리면, 똑같은 지침이라도 AI Studio 앱 빌더에서 '앱'으로 만들었을 때 훨씬 안정적이고 일관된 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다. 그 이유는 내부 작동 방식의 근본적인 차이 때문이에요.\n구분\n제미나이 채팅 (지침)\nAI Studio (앱 빌더)\n\n\n\n\n실행 환경\n대화형 (이전 대화가 누적되어 영향 O)\nAPI 호출형 (매번 독립적으로 실행, 영향 X)\n\n\n지침의 역할\n대화의 가이드라인 (유연함)\n강력한 시스템 명령 (엄격함)\n\n\n비유\n친한 개인 비서에게 말로 부탁\n회사의 공식 업무 매뉴얼 등록\n\n\n최적 활용\n개인화된 대화, 창의적 브레인스토밍\n안정적이고 반복적인 도구 제작\n\n\n\n주의하세요!\n제미나이 채팅은 이전 대화의 맥락에 따라 지침이 희석될 수 있지만, AI Studio 앱은 매번 깨끗한 상태에서 지침을 시스템 명령으로 엄격하게 실행합니다. 따라서 특정 작업을 안정적이고, 반복적이고, 예측 가능하게 수행하는 도구를 만들고 싶다면, AI Studio 앱 빌더를 사용하는 것이 정답입니다!\n물론 그렇다고 제미나이 지침 기능이 쓸모없는 것은 절대 아니에요. AI를 나만의 '대화 파트너'로 만들고 싶을 때, 창의적인 아이디어를 탐색할 때, 일시적인 작업을 간단히 시킬 때는 제미나이 지침이 훨씬 편리하고 효과적입니다. '도구'를 만드느냐, '대화 파트너'를 만드느냐의 차이로 이해하시면 쉽습니다.\n \n\n제미나이 앱 빌더 핵심 요약\n핵심 기능: 자연어(채팅)만으로 코딩 없이 실제 작동하는 앱을 제작할 수 있습니다.\n제작 가능 앱: 할 일 관리, 캐주얼 게임, AI 챗봇 등 아이디어만 있다면 무엇이든 가능합니다.\n기술 기반: 최신 기술인 React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS를 AI가 자동으로 적용하여 고품질 앱을 생성합니다.\n앱 빌더 vs 지침: 안정적이고 일관된 'AI 도구'를 만들고 싶다면 제미나이 채팅의 '지침' 기능보다 앱 빌더가 훨씬 유리합니다.\n아이디어만 있다면 누구나 개발자가 될 수 있는 시대, 지금 바로 도전해보세요!\n자주 묻는 질문\nQ: 제미나이 앱 빌더는 완전히 무료인가요?\nA: 네, 기본적인 앱 개발 및 테스트는 Google AI Studio에서 무료로 사용할 수 있습니다. 다만, 'Cloud Run'을 통해 앱을 공개적으로 배포하고 많은 사람들이 사용하게 되면 구글 클라우드 정책에 따라 소량의 비용이 발생할 수 있습니다.\nQ: 제가 만든 앱의 소스 코드를 직접 수정할 수도 있나요?\nA: 그럼요! AI가 생성한 코드는 React, TypeScript 기반의 실제 코드입니다. 다운로드 버튼을 통해 코드를 내려받아 Visual Studio Code와 같은 전문 코딩 프로그램에서 직접 수정하고 기능을 확장할 수 있습니다.\nQ: 복잡한 앱도 정말 만들 수 있나요? 한계는 없나요?\nA: 현재 단계에서는 데이터베이스 연동이 복잡하거나 매우 전문적인 기능을 가진 앱을 한 번에 만드는 데는 한계가 있을 수 있습니다. 하지만 아이디어를 빠르게 프로토타입으로 만들고 검증하는 용도로는 최고입니다. 간단한 요청부터 시작해서 단계적으로 기능을 추가하며 발전시키는 방식을 추천합니다.\nQ: '젬 지침'을 앱으로 만들면 왜 더 안정적인가요?\nA: 제미나이 채팅은 이전 대화의 영향을 받는 '대화형'이지만, 앱 빌더는 매번 독립적으로 실행되는 'API 호출형' 환경이기 때문입니다. 앱은 이전 대화에 방해받지 않고 오직 입력된 지침(시스템 명령)에 따라 엄격하게 작동하므로, 훨씬 더 예측 가능하고 일관된 결과를 보장합니다.\n이것으로 AI 스튜디오의 제미나이 앱 빌더를 활용한 노코드 앱 개발 강의를 마치겠습니다. 오늘 배운 내용으로 여러분도 아이디어만 있다면 누구나 실용적인 앱을 만들 수 있는 시대가 열렸다는 것을 확인하셨을 거예요. 오늘 강의가 도움이 되셨다면 구독과 좋아요 꼭 눌러주시고, 여러분이 만드신 멋진 앱도 댓글로 자랑해주세요! 감사합니다!",

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">《매일 아침 써봤니》</span>였어요. 책 전체를 요약하려는 부담은 내려놓고, 제가 정말 인상 깊게 읽은 문장들만 따로 모았죠. 종이책이라면 포스트잇이나 밑줄, 사진 찍기를 활용해도 좋고, 전자책은 밀리의 서재나 리디북스의 메모 기능으로 하이라이트를 정리할 수 있어서 편해요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이렇게 모은 문장들을 가지고 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 말했어요. \"제가 밑줄 친 문장을 각 장별로 3가지 핵심 포인트로 요약해 주세요.\" 챕터별로 깔끔하게 정리된 요약을 받아보니, 그 안에서 실천 아이디어로 확장할 수 있을 만한 포인트들이 하나둘씩 눈에 들어오기 시작했습니다. 진짜 신기하더라고요!</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px;

ChatGPT를 활용해 나만의 자기계발 워크북을 만드는 구체적인 방법을 소개합니다. 더 이상 책장에 꽂아두지만 말고, 내 삶의 변화를 위한 첫걸음을 시작해보세요.\n\n\n \n자기계발서, 좋아하시나요? 저도 참 좋아하는데요, 좋은 문장을 발견하면 밑줄을 긋고, 메모하고, 혼자 감탄까지 하죠. 근데 이상하게도, 그렇게 열심히 읽은 책들이 제 삶을 진짜로 바꿔줬던 적은 별로 없었던 것 같아요. 오히려 시간이 지나면 어떤 책을 읽었는지 가물가물해질 때가 더 많더라고요.  \n그러던 어느 날, 우연히 유튜브에서 \"책은 읽는 게 아니라 써야 내 것이 된다. 워크북을 만들어 보세요\"라는 한 크리에이터의 말을 듣게 됐습니다. 이 한마디가 머릿속을 쾅! 하고 울렸달까요? 그래서 저는 그날부터 책 속 문장들을 바탕으로 나만의 실천 워크북을 ChatGPT와 함께 만들기 시작했어요.\n1. 책의 핵심 문장을 정리하기  \n가장 먼저 시작한 책은 김민식 PD님의 베스트셀러, 《매일 아침 써봤니》였어요. 책 전체를 요약하려는 부담은 내려놓고, 제가 정말 인상 깊게 읽은 문장들만 따로 모았죠. 종이책이라면 포스트잇이나 밑줄, 사진 찍기를 활용해도 좋고, 전자책은 밀리의 서재나 리디북스의 메모 기능으로 하이라이트를 정리할 수 있어서 편해요.\n이렇게 모은 문장들을 가지고 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 말했어요. \"제가 밑줄 친 문장을 각 장별로 3가지 핵심 포인트로 요약해 주세요.\" 챕터별로 깔끔하게 정리된 요약을 받아보니, 그 안에서 실천 아이디어로 확장할 수 있을 만한 포인트들이 하나둘씩 눈에 들어오기 시작했습니다. 진짜 신기하더라고요!\n2. 감명 깊은 문장에서 실천 아이디어 뽑아내기  \n책을 읽으며 가장 마음에 남았던 문장은 바로 \"글을 쓰는 사람은 매일 자신을 편집해 나가는 사람이다.\"였어요. 이 문장을 보는 순간, '나도 매일 나를 조금씩 편집할 수 있을까?' 하는 생각이 들었죠. 그래서 바로 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 물어봤습니다.\n  ChatGPT 프롬프트 예시\n\"이 문장(‘글을 쓰는 사람은 매일 자신을 편집해 나가는 사람이다’)을 바탕으로 제가 일상에서 실천할 수 있는 3가지 방법을 알려주세요.\"\n그 결과 나온 제안들은 정말 현실적이었어요. 예를 들어, '하루 한 문장으로 나를 돌아보는 글 써보기', 'SNS 대신 5분간 일기 쓰기', '하루를 마무리하며 \"오늘 내가 가장 자랑스러운 선택은?\"이라고 스스로에게 질문하기' 같은 아이디어였죠. 이렇게 얻은 아이디어들을 바탕으로 자연스럽게 워크북에 넣을 질문과 과제들이 만들어지기 시작했습니다.\n3. 연습 문제는 다양하게 구성하기 ✨\n꾸준히 실천하려면 한 가지 형식보다는 여러 형식의 연습 문제를 섞는 게 좋아요. 제가 주로 사용한 대표적인 형식들을 표로 정리해봤습니다.\n문제 형식\n예시\n\n\n\n\n반성 질문 (Reflection)\n\"나는 어떤 글을 쓸 때 가장 내 마음에 솔직한가요?\"\n\n\n미니 프로젝트 (Mini Project)\n\"하루 5분, ‘감정 일기’ 실험해보기\"\n\n\n습관 추적기 (Habit Tracker)\n\"일주일간 글쓰기 습관 체크리스트 만들어보기\"\n\n\n시각화 질문 (Visualization)\n\"3개월 동안 매일 글을 쓴 나의 모습을 상상해보세요.\"\n\n\n\n이런 질문들은 단순한 ‘독서’를 넘어, 나 자신과 마주보게 하는 대화의 도구가 되어줍니다. 책의 내용을 내 삶으로 끌어당기는 힘이 생기는 거죠.  \n4. 한 챕터만 골라도 충분합니다  \n처음부터 책 전체를 다 워크북으로 만들려고 하면 정말 부담스럽잖아요. 그래서 저는 한 챕터씩, 딱 하나의 문장만 골라 연습 문제를 만들기 시작했습니다. 예를 들어 《매일 아침 써봤니》 중 ‘아침 루틴과 글쓰기’에 대한 챕터를 골라 이렇게 구성해봤어요.\n  실천 워크북 챕터 구성 예시\n핵심 아이디어: 아침은 하루 중 가장 순수한 시간이다.\n반성하기: 나는 아침을 어떻게 보내고 있는가?\n실천하기: 내일 아침 10분만 '마음 흘려쓰기' 실험하기\n기록하기: 7일간 아침 글쓰기 실천 결과 기록지 만들기\n이런 식으로 핵심 → 시도 → 반성 → 추적의 흐름을 따라가면 어떤 책이든 워크북 형식으로 재구성할 수 있습니다. 한 챕터만 완벽하게 내 것으로 만들어도 충분한 성과가 되잖아요.\n5. 나만의 워크북 만들기 (Google Docs 활용)  \n완성된 질문과 과제들은 Google Docs에 정리했어요. 노션(Notion)이나 티스토리 비공개 글 등 편한 도구를 활용하면 됩니다. 제 워크북의 구성은 대략 이랬어요.\n표지: 책 제목과 '나만의 성장 노트'\n시작 노트: 왜 이 책을 선택했고, 무엇을 실천하고 싶은지\n챕터별 연습 문제: 질문 + 실천 + 추적 템플릿\n중간 점검 페이지: \"지금까지 잘한 점은?\", \"아직 어려운 점은?\"\n마무리 편지: \"이 책을 읽고, 나는 이렇게 변했다.\", \"앞으로 무엇을 지속하고 싶은가?\"\nChatGPT에게 \"이 내용을 예쁘게 정리된 워크북 형식으로 만들어주세요 (Google Docs용)\"이라고 요청하면 서식 구성도 도와주니 참고해 보세요!\n \n마무리하며: 책은 곧 도구입니다  ️\n예전엔 책을 다 읽으면 배움도 끝났다고 생각했어요. 하지만 지금은 책을 다 읽은 순간이 진짜 실천의 시작점이 된다는 걸 깨달았죠. 책장에 꽂힌 책이 아니라, 손에 들고 직접 '쓰는' 책이 되어야 하니까요.\n하이라이트 한 줄, 인상적인 문장 하나면 충분합니다. 그걸 ChatGPT에게 보여주고, 질문을 던져보세요. 그 작은 문장이 여러분의 삶에 생각지 못한 작은 변화를 일으킬 수 있습니다. 책이 책장에 꽂혀 있기만 한다면, 너무 아깝지 않을까요? 지금 한 챕터만 골라서, 워크북으로 꺼내보세요. 저처럼 분명히 새로운 ‘무언가’가 시작될 거예요.  \n \n \nChatGPT와 함께 워크북 만들기\n✨ 핵심 문장 정리: 책 전체가 아닌, 인상 깊은 문장만 추려보세요!\n  실천 아이디어 확장: \"내가 일상에서 실천할 수 있는 방법\"을 ChatGPT에게 물어보세요.\n  다양한 문제 구성:\n반성 질문, 미니 프로젝트, 습관 추적기, 시각화 질문 등\n  부담 없이 시작: 한 챕터씩만 골라 연습 문제를 만들어봐도 충분해요!\n책을 '읽기'에서 '쓰기'로 바꿔 당신의 성장을 편집하세요.\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 워크북을 만드는 데 꼭 ChatGPT를 써야 하나요?\nA: 꼭 필요한 건 아니지만, ChatGPT는 실천 아이디어를 구체화하고 다양한 연습 문제를 만드는 데 큰 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 혼자 고민하는 시간을 줄이고, 아이디어를 빠르게 확장하는 좋은 도구죠.\nQ: 워크북을 만들 책은 어떻게 고르는 게 좋을까요?\nA: 가장 좋아하는 책, 혹은 최근에 읽으면서 '이거다!' 하고 감명 깊었던 문장이 있는 책으로 시작해 보세요. 처음부터 부담 없이 시작하는 것이 가장 중요합니다.\nQ: 책 전체를 다 다뤄야 한다는 부담이 있어요.\nA: 굳이 책 전체를 다 다룰 필요는 없습니다. 글에서 제안한 것처럼, 가장 인상 깊은 한 챕터나 문장만 골라 워크북을 만들어도 충분한 효과를 볼 수 있어요. 작게 시작해 보세요!\n\n\n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워크북을 만드는 데 꼭 ChatGPT를 써야 하나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  꼭 필요한 건 아니지만, ChatGPT는 실천 아이디어를 구체화하고 다양한 연습 문제를 만드는 데 큰 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 혼자 고민하는 시간을 줄이고, 아이디어를 빠르게 확장하는 좋은 도구죠.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워크북을 만들 책은 어떻게 고르는 게 좋을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  가장 좋아하는 책, 혹은 최근에 읽으면서 '이거다!' 하고 감명 깊었던 문장이 있는 책으로 시작해 보세요. 처음부터 부담 없이 시작하는 것이 가장 중요합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"책 전체를 다 다뤄야 한다는 부담이 있어요.\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  굳이 책 전체를 다 다룰 필요는 없습니다. 글에서 제안한 것처럼, 가장 인상 깊은 한 챕터나 문장만 골라 워크북을 만들어도 충분한 효과를 볼 수 있어요. 작게 시작해 보세요!\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "스트롱을 처음 시작할 때, 주위의 선배 VC 분들이 투자는 농부가 씨를 뿌리고, 식물이 죽지 않고 잘 자라기를 바라는 농부의 마음이 있어야 한다는 조언을 해줬다. 경험한 만큼만 알고, 아는 만큼만 안다는 말처럼, 그땐 이게 무슨 말인지 몰랐는데, 13년 동안 VC를 해보니 이제 이 농부의 마음이 어떤 건지 조금씩 알 것 같고, 실제로 매일 농사를 짓는 마음으로 투자하고, 투자사를 대하고 있다.\n이건 한국이나 미국이나 마찬가지라서 가장 초기에 투자하는 걸 시드(=seed) 투자라고 하는가 보다. 우리 같은 시드 투자자는 말 그대로 씨가 잘 자라기 위한 초기 자금을 제공하거나, 아니면 우리가 이 씨를 뿌린다고 생각할 수 있다. 우리는 농부와 같이 아주 넓은 농장이나 밭에 아주 랜덤하게 많은 씨를 뿌리고, 이 씨들이 잘 자랄 수 있게 다양한 지원을 한다. 일단 이 씨들이 잘 자라기 위한 필수 요소인 물과 토양은 VC들이 제공하는 자금이다. 씨앗이 자라서 큰 나무가 되려면 더욱더 많은 수분이 필요하고, 더 많은 영양소가 시기적절하게 필요한데, 스타트업이 성장하려면 더 많은 자금이 필요한 것과 비슷하다고 보면 된다.\n물과 비료는 농부가 제공할 수도 있다. 하지만, 씨앗이 나무가 되기 위해선 이 외에도 많은 게 필요하다. 비도 와야 하고, 충분한 햇빛도 필요하고, 바람도 불어야 하는데 날씨는 농부가 컨트롤할 수 없는 시장 상황과 비슷하다. 유동성이 풍부해서 투자를 잘 받는 시장 환경이 있는가 하면, 최근 몇 년과 같이 돈이 말라서 가뭄인 환경도 있는데, 이건 우리가 어떻게 할 수 없어서 그때마다 시장 상황에 따라서 적응하고 조절해야 한다. 아무리 노련한 농부도 항상 풍년만 경험하는 게 아니다. 농사하다 보면 날씨와 같은 여러 가지 외부 요소 때문에 풍년과 흉년을 번갈아 경험하는데, 노련한 농부는 이때마다 잘 적응하고 조절한다.\n농부의 마음으로 뿌린 씨가 잘 자라길 간절히 바라지만, 솔직히 이 중 어떤 씨앗이 생존해서 큰 나무가 될 진 아무도 모른다. 재수 없는 흉년이면 모든 씨앗이 전멸하고, 토양이 오염되거나 비가 너무 많이 오거나, 부족하거나, 또는 햇빛이 부족하면 씨는 작은 나무에서 성장을 멈춘다. 하지만, 모든 게 잘 맞아떨어지면, 시간이 지나면서 씨앗에도 복리의 힘이 작용하고, 작은 씨앗이 엄청나게 튼튼하고 큰 나무로 자라는 경우도 있다. 물론, 이런 회사들은 아웃라이어다. 일단 이렇게 나무가 무럭무럭 자라려면 시간이 엄청 많이 걸리고 그 긴 기간 동안 이 나무가 중간에 죽을 수 있는 수백만 가지의 일들이 일어날 수 있다. 농부는 매일 일어나서 하늘을 보면서 날씨를 확인하고, 나뭇잎을 확인하고, 물을 주고, 해충을 죽이고, 정기적으로 토양을 교체해 준다. 마치 우리가 경기의 맥을 확인하고, 투자사의 현금흐름을 확인하고, KPI를 확인하고, 창업가의 정신 상태를 확인하는 것과 비슷한 것 같다.\n가끔은 오랫동안 새싹이 안 올라와서 죽은 줄 알고 방치하는 경우도 있다. 물도 안 주고, 비료도 안 주는데, 어느 날 밭에 가보니까 잡초같이 잘 자라서 아주 큰 나무가 되는 경우도 있다. 크게 기대하지 않았고, 사업을 잘 못 해서 별로 신경 쓰지 않거나, 손실 처리한 회사가 갑자기 엄청나게 빠르게 성장하고, 아주 좋은 VC에게 후속 투자를 받는 게 이런 경우다. 솔직히 우리도 이런 잡초의 케이스를 몇 번 경험했는데, 아주 기분이 좋다. 이런 경우가 더 많으면 좋겠다.\n참고로, 우리같이 많은 스타트업에 투자하는 모델을 미국에서는 ‘spray and pray’ 모델이라고 한다. 많이 뿌리고, 이 중 몇 개가 잘 되길 기도한다는 의미인데, 대화의 컨텍스트에 따라서 많이 투자하고 무책임하게 기도만 하는 도박이라는 부정적인 의미일 수도 있고, 많이 투자하고 열심히 기도한다는(=도와준다는) 긍정적인 의미가 될 수도 있다. 나는 그래서 항상 농담처럼 “우린 spray and pray를 하는데, 나는 pray 하는데 더 많은 시간을 보낸다.”라고도 한다. 그만큼 어떤 회사가 잘 될지 아무도 모르고, 워낙 초기 회사라서 VC가 아무리 이 회사들을 도와줘도 그 결과는 항상 불확실하다는 의미이기도 하다.\n오늘도 열심히 일하러 밭으로 향하고 있고, 기도도 많이 하고 있다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "바로 이전 포스팅에 이어 비슷한 맥락의 글을 또 써본다.\n할 수 있는 여건이 되는데도 두려움과 매너리즘 때문에 국도에서 고속도로로 진입하지 못하는 많은 회사들은 언젠가는 망할 확률이 높다. 좋은 비즈니스 모델을 찾아서 돈을 버는 사업 구조를 만들긴 했지만, 이 상황에서는 수익성이 엄청나게 좋진 않을 것이고, 이런 사업은 너무나 다양한 내, 외부 요소의 변화에 대한 면역력이 떨어지기 때문이다. 갑자기 돈이 많은 경쟁사가 시장에 나타나서 시장점유율을 뺐을 수도 있고, 직원들이 대거 퇴사하면서 막대한 퇴직금으로 회복할 수 없는 수준으로 비용이 증가할 수도 있고, 의존하던 유통 채널에 큰 변화가 생길 수도 있고, 그냥 너무 성장이 없어서 직원들이 하나둘씩 떠나면서 사업의 규모가 쪼그라들 수도 있다.\n또한, 이런 비즈니스는 위에서 말한 대로 면역력이 그렇게 높지 않기 때문에, 매번, 매달, 매년 흑자를 내진 못할 것이다. 어떤 달은 살짝 적자가 날 수도 있고, 어떤 달은 일회성 비용이 확 증가할 수도 있다. 또한, 현금 보유량은 계속 유지되거나, 조금씩 증가할 수도 있지만, 물가상승률을 고려했을 때 임직원들의 연봉도 같이 올라야 하는데, 성장 없이 현 상태에서 이것저것 맞추다 보면 서서히 비즈니스는 줄어들 것이다. 이런 상황에서 갑자기 새로운 경쟁사가 출현하거나, 대기업이 이 시장으로 진입하면, 면역력이 약한 사람이 단순 감기 탓에 사망할 수 있듯이, 이 사업은 한 방에 망할 수 있다.\n즉, 계속 국도로만 가다 보면, 영어로 말하는 slow death를 맞이할 확률이 매우 높다. 그 속도가 너무 느려서 잘 못 느낄 뿐이지, 시간이 갈수록 이 사업은 천천히 침몰하는 배와 같이 천천히 속력이 줄어서 멈출 것이다. 우리 사업도 현재 느리게 죽고 있다면, 대표들은 아주 과감한 결정을 내릴 필요가 있다. 즉, 빨리 고속도로로 진입해야 한다.\n과감한 결정을 했는데 그 방향이 잘못됐다면, 빨리 죽을 수도 있지만, 어쩌면 이게 느린 죽음보다 더 나을 수 있다. 바로 죽든, 느리게 죽든, 어차피 결론은 똑같이 망하는 것이라면, 그냥 지금 당장 망해서 대표와 임직원들이 하루라도 젊었을 때 다른 곳에 취직하거나, 다른 시도를 하는 게 모두에게 더 좋을 수도 있기 때문이다.\n이 글을 다시 읽어보니, 조금 극단적이긴 하다. 어쨌든 우리 사업이 이렇게 천천히 죽어가는 건 아닌지, 대표들은 냉정하게 판단해 볼 필요가 있다.",

F1을 잘 몰랐던 시청자들도 이 시리즈를 통해 드라이버 간 경쟁과 팀 내부의 긴장감을 실감 나게 접할 수 있었고, F1을 하나의 콘텐츠로 받아들이기 시작했죠. 시즌 7까지 이어지고 있는 이 시리즈는 F1 관중 수 증가로도 이어졌어요. 2018년 410만 명이던 F1 대회 관중은 2024년 650만 명을 넘겼습니다.\n\n이 변화는 스폰서십 구조도 바꿔놓았습니다. 기존의 F1 매니아나 부자들이 아닌 대중들이 F1 대회에 큰 관심을 갖게 됐기 때문입니다. F1은 전통적으로 자동차, 에너지, 정유, 명품 브랜드 중심의 후원 구성이 많았습니다. 루이비통, 롤렉스 등이 대표적이었죠. \n하지만 대중적인 관심이 높아지자, 이제는 소비재 브랜드도 적극적으로 F1에 뛰어들고 있습니다. 펩시, 하이네켄, 네슬레 같은 기업들이 F1을 새로운 마케팅 무대로 삼았고, 태그호이어는 롤렉스를 대신해 공식 타임키퍼가 되었으며, 아디다스는 메르세데스 팀과 협업을 맺었습니다. 더 많은 사람들이 F1을 보기 시작하자, 다양한 브랜드가 F1을 찾기 시작한 겁니다.\n\n하이네켄 광고로 가득 찬 F1 서킷 광고판 / 사진: 로이터\n미국인은 F1을 안 본다는\n편견을 깬 신의 한 수\n리버티 미디어는 미국 기업답게 F1의 불모지였던 미국 시장 공략에 나섰습니다. F1을 대중 스포츠로 만들기 위해서는 글로벌 확장이 필수였고, 그 중심에는 미국이 있었습니다.\nF1은 미국 시장에서 철저히 외면받던 종목이었습니다. 미국인들은 내스카(NASCAR)나 인디카 같은 자국 중심의 레이스를 더 좋아했거든요. 하지만 리버티 미디어는 이 판을 흔들었습니다. 2022년 마이애미, 2023년 라스베이거스에 신규 그랑프리를 신설했고, 특히 라스베이거스에서는 결승전을 일요일이 아닌 토요일 밤에 열어 도시의 파티 문화와 F1을 연결하는 전략을 택했습니다.\n이는 일요일에 결선 레이스를 펼치는 다른 F1 대회와 차별화 되는 부분인데요. 결선 레이스를 토요일 밤에 배치함으로써 라스베이거스 특유의 야간 관광, 파티, 쇼 비즈니스와의 시너지를 극대화할 수 있었기 때문이죠.\n이 전략은 대성공을 거뒀습니다. 2024년 라스베이거스 F1 대회의 총수입은 1조 2,877억 원으로, 이는 내스카나 인디카 전체 연간 수입을 뛰어넘는 수준이었습니다. 평균 티켓 가격은 약 139만 원으로 24개 F1 대회 중 가장 비쌌고, 지역 경제에 미친 영향도 막대했습니다. 단 3일간 라스베이거스가 벌어들인 세금 수입만 620억 원에 달했죠.\n미국에서 F1에 대한 관심이 커지면서 중계권료도 크게 상승할 것으로 보여요. ESPN이 지불하는 현재 연간 중계권료는 약 1,254억 원 수준이지만, 넷플릭스와 애플TV가 차기 입찰에 뛰어들며 2배 이상 상승할 것이라는 전망이 나옵니다. 여기에 2026년부터는 미국 자동차 브랜드 캐딜락이 F1에 참가할 예정이고, 미국 출신 스타급 드라이버가 탄생한다면 F1에 대한 미국 내 열기는 더욱 커질 것으로 보입니다.\nF1 수익의 숨은 핵심\n레이스 프로모션 비용\n리버티 미디어가 디지털 플랫폼을 통한 대중화 전략과 미국 시장 공략에 성공하면서, F1의 매출 규모는 빠르게 성장했습니다. 2017년 약 2조 4,800억 원이었던 매출은 2024년 기준 약 4조 7,500억 원으로 늘었죠. 7년 동안 91%나 증가한 셈입니다.\n2024년 F1의 수익 구조를 살펴보면, 중계권료가 전체의 약 33%를 차지해 가장 큰 비중을 기록합니다. 이어서 29%는 레이스 프로모션 비용, 나머지 38%는 스폰서십과 패독 클럽을 포함한 기타 수익으로 구성됩니다.\n이 가운데 ‘레이스 프로모션 비용’은 F1만의 독특한 수익 모델이에요. F1은 전 세계 도시와 계약을 맺고, 그 도시에 대회를 열 수 있는 ‘개최권’을 판매합니다. 대회를 유치하려는 도시나 사업자는 매년 수백억 원에 달하는 비용을 F1에 지불해야 하죠. 이 비용이 바로 레이스 프로모션 비용입니다. 다른 프로 스포츠에서 찾아 볼 수 없는 중요한 비즈니스 모델이죠.\n\n2025년 기준, 레이스 프로모션 비용은 대회가 열리는 도시마다 다릅니다. 가장 많은 비용을 지불하는 도시는 아제르바이잔의 수도 바쿠로, 연간 793억 원에 달합니다. 사우디아라비아와 카타르도 각각 764억 원 수준의 비용을 부담하고 있죠.\n흥미로운 점은, 이들 국가에서 열리는 F1 대회는 관중 수가 매우 적다는 것입니다. 바쿠 그랑프리는 연간 7만 5,000명 수준으로 전체 F1 대회 중 최하위권에 머뭅니다. 관중이 적음에도 높은 비용을 지불하는 이유는, 국가 브랜드 홍보 목적이 크기 때문입니다. 오일머니를 기반으로 한 중동 국가들은 F1을 통해 자국의 이미지를 바꾸려는 전략을 취하고 있는 거죠.\n전 세계 도시들이수백억을 들여 F1을 유치하는 이유\nF1 대회를 개최하려면 수백억 원의 비용을 지불해야 합니다. 게다가 대부분의 경우 장기 계약이 필요하기 때문에, 한 도시가 수천억 원에 이르는 비용을 부담하는 일도 흔하죠. 그런데도 전 세계 많은 도시들이 F1 유치에 열을 올리는 이유는 무엇일까요? 답은 간단합니다. 관광 수입과 도시 브랜딩입니다.\n\n모나코 항구에서 펼쳐지는 F1 경기 모습 / 사진: 로이터\n대표적인 성공 사례는 인구 4만 명도 안 되는 도시국가 모나코입니다. 아름다운 항구 도시를 배경으로 펼쳐지는 모나코 그랑프리는 F1 역사상 가장 상징적인 대회로 꼽힙니다. 모나코 그랑프리는 1950년부터 시작돼 지금까지 이어지고 있고, 대회 기간 동안 전체 관광 수입의 약 30%를 벌어들일 만큼 경제적 효과도 큽니다. F1 역시 모나코를 특별하게 생각합니다. 상징성과 흥행력이 높기 때문에, 때로는 개최권료를 거의 받지 않거나 276억 원 수준의 상대적으로 낮은 비용만 받고 대회를 개최하기도 하죠.\n싱가포르 역시 F1 하면 빼놓을 수 없는 도시입니다. 2008년부터 시작된 싱가포르 그랑프리는 도심 스트리트 서킷에서 야간에 펼쳐지는 ‘나이트 레이스’로 유명합니다. 루프탑 바나 고층 빌딩에서도 경기를 관람할 수 있어 도시 전체가 축제 분위기로 바뀌죠. 지난 10년간 이 대회를 보기 위해 싱가포르를 찾은 관광객은 약 45만 명, 이들이 쓴 돈은 약 2조 원에 달합니다. 싱가포르 정부가 매년 487억 원의 개최권료를 기꺼이 지불하는 이유가 여기에 있습니다.\n한 번 실패했던 한국,\n다시 F1에 도전할 수 있을까\n한국도 한때 F1 대회를 개최한 적이 있습니다. 2010년부터 2013년까지 전남 영암에서 열렸지만, F1에 대한 낮은 인지도, 접근성 부족, 열악한 인프라 탓에 흥행에 실패했고, 높은 개최권 비용(약 480억 원)과 수익성 악화로 2014년부터 대회 개최를 포기했습니다. 영암 F1 대회조직위원회의 발표에 따르면 2010년에는 700억 원, 2011년에는 600억 원의 적자를 기록했습니다.\n\n2012년 영암에서 펼쳐진 코리아 그랑프리에 참가한 레드불 팀 / 사진: 로이터\n그런데 최근 인천시가 다시 F1 대회 유치에 나섰습니다. 싱가포르처럼 도심 스트리트 서킷을 고려하고 있고, 이를 위해 인천시는 전체 사업비의 30%를 국비로 지원받기 위해 노력 중입니다. 인천은 국제공항과 수도권 접근성이라는 이점을 갖췄고, 무엇보다 지금은 한국에서도 F1 콘텐츠의 팬층이 꽤 형성됐다는 점에서 성공 가능성이 있어 보입니다.\nF1 대회는 지구상에서 가장 빠른 스포츠 대회입니다. 하지만 F1 대회 개최 여부에 대한 논의는 다양한 문제를 검토해야 하기 때문에 빠르게 하면 안 됩니다. 인천의 F1 대회가 싱가포르 대회와 같은 성공을 거두려면 더더욱 그렇죠. 싱가포르도 F1 대회 유치를 결정하기까지 5~6년 동안 면밀한 검토를 했습니다.\n과연 한 차례 실패를 경험했던 한국에서 F1 대회는 성공할 수 있을까요?\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",
