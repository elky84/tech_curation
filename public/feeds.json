        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Microsoft C++ team attended CppCon, the largest C++ conference in the world. This year, the conference was held in Aurora, Colorado from September 16-20.\nMicrosoft Booth\nOur team managed a booth from Monday to Thursday of the week. This gave us an amazing opportunity to interact with the C++ community and discuss many topics of interest as well as hear feedback from our customers.\n\nThe following people worked at the booth (from left to right in the picture above):\nVictor Ciura, who works on Rust and C++ interop. He presented a talk called So You Think You Can Hash.\nMryam Girmay, who works on Visual Studio productivity features. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nSinem Akinci, who works on CMake tooling in the Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code. Sinem also works on GitHub Copilot. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nAugustin Popa (me), and I work on the vcpkg package manager. My talk was called 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them.\nAlexandra Kemper, who works on the C++ experience in Visual Studio Code. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nMichael Price, who works on C++ integration with developer services like GitHub and Microsoft Dev Box. He was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nMicrosoft works on several developer tools for C++, including the Visual Studio IDE, Visual Studio Code, the MSVC compiler toolset, GitHub Copilot for C++, and the vcpkg package manager. We interacted with hundreds of C++ developers across a variety of different industries, experience levels, and familiarity with our product offerings. There were folks who had been using our products before their names started with “Visual”, and some that had never used our tools at all.\nWe were excited to see so much interest from developers for C++ best practices and how to become more productive. We received some great feedback about how we could improve our tools, in terms of bug reports, user experience improvements, and feature requests. We were also able to have several 1 on 1 longer discussions away from the booth to help people solve more specific challenges using Microsoft C++ developer tools.\n\nAt the booth we also gave out some cool swag, including USB adapters, vcpkg bags, stickers, and the ever-popular Visual Studio socks.\nWe also held a raffle at the end of each day at our booth, for some Visual Studio backpacks and tote bags.\n\n\n\nKeynote Talk: Peering forward – C++’s next decade\nAs usual, Herb Sutter delivered an excellent talk at CppCon. This year it was a keynote that looks forward in time, describing the planned evolution of the C++ language. The main topics were reflection, safety, and simplicity. These topics were effectively previews for a number of other C++ talks that elaborated on these topics in great detail.\n\n\nMicrosoft Talks at CppCon 2024\nAside from Herb’s keynote, there were several other talks delivered by folks from Microsoft at CppCon this year.\nSo You Think You Can Hash\nVictor delivered a talk on fundamentals of data structure design, focusing on computing hashes for aggregated user-defined types and experimenting with various hash algorithms. He introduced a method for experimenting with and benchmarking different hash algorithms. This allows easy switching of hashing algorithms used by complex data structures, enabling easy comparisons. This way, hash algorithm designers can concentrate on designing better hash algorithms, with little worry about how these new algorithms can be incorporated into existing code. Type designers can create their hash support just once, without worrying about what hashing algorithm should be used.\n\nThe talk spurred a bunch of hallway conversations on tradeoffs between performance and flexibility of type design, with attendees sharing their project pains and workarounds in this space.\n10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them\nI presented a talk on 10 problems that large companies have with C++ dependency management, based on many conversations I had this year with enterprise teams. I also went over how these companies are solving these problems. About half of the problems are solvable with a modern package manager, but the rest require additional investments in development workflows. The talk was well attended and there were some good conversations afterward about the problems.\n\nToday, developers are still more likely to manually manage their dependencies than to use a package manager and consider managing libraries a top pain point for C++, according to ISO C++ surveys. I pointed out some ways that a package manager like vcpkg can mitigate the pain. Here are a few examples:\nSupporting build from source as a fallback without sacrificing the build-time savings of binary dependency acquisition.\nUpgrading dependencies as a set using baselines, rather than managing them individually, to avoid version conflicts / diamond problems.\nHow to continue working in an offline build environment using asset caching.\nGetting any open-source libraries installed and working with your project with minimal effort, while also automatically resolving transitive dependencies.\nIn the second half of the talk, I noted that security is top of mind for enterprises, so vulnerability monitoring, detection, and response is critical. Some enterprises have also started using Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to track their dependencies and manage risk. I also pointed out that vcpkg generates SPDX SBOM files for dependencies.\nLastly, I spoke about some workflow changes that make it more manageable to do C++ development at scale, at a large company with many distributed teams. This includes centralizing common development tasks with dedicated core teams, moving to container-based builds and a standardized global build toolchain, and how to handle a large migration to a new software system by breaking it down into smaller, manageable milestones where you get a win at each step.\n\nAfter my talk, I talked with several folks about the problems they were dealing with at their work and what they had in common with the themes of the talk. In my opinion, one of the best things about delivering a talk is the conversations that happen afterward, which lead to new ideas and approaches to improve our software.\nEmbracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security\nAmanda Rousseau delivered a compelling talk on thinking like an adversary with respect to C++ security. She walked through some attack scenarios, vulnerability trends, exploits that actually exist out in the wild, and general strategies for C++ development. For Microsoft, security is always top of mind, and it was interesting hearing from her experiences about how to address these growing concerns.\n\nWhat’s new for Visual Studio Code: Performance, GitHub Copilot, and CMake Enhancements\nThe annual Visual Studio Code talk, delivered this year by Alexandra Kemper and Sinem Akinci, was packed full of updates for C++ developers. Enhancing performance for C++ developers was a top priority for our team, and the talk announced several updates to make the C++ development process faster, including updates to project start-up time and time to colorization. The talk featured enhancements to C++ Copilot completions, sample AI-assisted workflows in C++ code, and new Copilot extensibility points available for developers to tailor the AI tool to their workflow. Demonstrating the chat extension API extensibility points to CppCon via a @CppCon chat participant piqued interest in the crowd. The docs to learn more about these APIs available can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat.\n\n\nThe demo code that was used can be found below. The first demo focused on C++, CMake, and Copilot functionality whereas the second demo focused on a CppCon chat participant for Copilot.\nsinemakinci1/Cpp-Copilot-VSC-Demo at alex-gui-2\nsinemakinci1/cppcon-chat-participant: Chat participant for CppCon\n\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers\nMryam Girmay and Michael Price presented the 10th annual session demonstrating new features for C++ developers in Visual Studio. Highlighted this year were features to make you a more productive C++ developer, from shrinking your build times with Build Insights and Include Diagnostics, to reducing the amount of time you spend crafting the perfect commit message for those changes you’ve accumulated throughout the day, by letting GitHub Copilot write a first draft for you.\n\nVisual Studio leverages the power of GitHub Copilot to reduce the burden of routine tasks like sketching out unit tests for a function you just wrote or wading through pages of template error messages to understand what you’ve done wrong. And in the talk, Michael and Mryam demonstrated the soon-to-be-generally available content exclusion feature that you can configure to prevent contents from specified files never get sent in a prompt to GitHub Copilot. They also showcased interactive demos, allowing developers to see firsthand how these new features can be leveraged in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nAfter the talk, developers shared valuable feedback on Visual Studio, the Microsoft C++ compiler, and GitHub Copilot. Attendees came with questions and offered several suggestions on how we can further improve our products for them. This input is crucial as the team continues to refine and enhance the tool to better meet the needs of C++ developers.\n\nSome Other Interesting Talks\nThere were many great talks this year. Below are a few that we enjoyed.\nCommon Package Specification (CPS) in practice: A full round trip implementation in Conan C++ package manager\nDiego Rodriguez-Losada Gonzalez of JFrog delivered a very interesting talk where he demoed integrated Common Package Specification (CPS) files with various build systems, including CMake, MSBuild, Autotools, and Meson. The Common Package Specification is a mechanism for describing the useful artifacts of a software package and is a collaborative effort between several software vendors, build system maintainers, library authors, and large companies to eventually standardize such a system across the industry.\nCreating a Sender/Receiver HTTP Server\nThis session was a live-coding demo with building an HTTP server from scratch and debugging problems using C++26 sender/receivers.\nPerformance engineering – Being friendly to your hardware\nExcellent crash course on hardware details, from DRAM inner-workings to CPUs and how to write software to avoid angering the machine.\nSender Patterns to Wrangle Concurrency in Embedded Devices\nSuperb introduction to bare-metal senders and receivers and very crisp explanations of the async examples.\nC++/Rust Interop: Using Bridges in Practice\nQuick tour of the Rust/C++ interop essentials and some of the friction points in hybrid-code projects.\nTheme: Reflection\nEvery CppCon, there tends to be a big focus on some major feature that is coming up in the language. For a long time, that used to be modules. Now that modules are successfully baked into many of our developer tools and are seeing some adoption, the biggest discussion topic has moved to reflection. Reflection is a significant feature improvement that many of us have looked forward to for years, and our patience is getting rewarded. Aside from Herb’s keynote, there were several talks, including Reflection based libraries to look forward to (by Saksham Sharma), Reflection is Not Contemplation (by Andrei Alexandrescu), and Implementing Reflection using the new C++20 Tooling Opportunity: Modules (by Maiko Steeman). Lastly, Daveed Vandevoorde’s Gazing Beyond Reflection for C++26 went into some excellent technical detail while giving a preview of what’s to come and is worth checking out.\nTheme: C++ Security\nWe have all seen the headlines from industry analysts and governments over the past few years citing concerns with code safety or security in C++. This is a big focus area for the C++ Committee as well as large companies that must worry about rising threats to their business. Some specialized talks included: Security Beyond Memory Safety – Using Modern C++ to Avoid Vulnerabilities by Design (by Max Hoffmann), Embracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security (by Amanda Rousseau), Building Safe and Reliable Surgical Robotics (by Milad Khaledyan), Modern C++ Error Handling (by Phil Nash), Mix Assertion, Logging, Unit Testing and Fuzzing: Build Safer Modern C++ Applications (by Xiaofan Sun), “Pick a random number… no, not that one!” – Tales of Real-World Exploits Based on Bad Randomness (by Max Hoffmann), and Compile-time Validation (by Alon Wolf).\nIn addition, LLVM’s Realtime Safety Revolution: Tools for Modern Mission Critical Systems (by Christopher Apple and David Trevelyan) introduced the new Realtime Sanitizer, which detects calls to malloc, pthread_mutex_lock, and other problematic functions in your realtime code at runtime!\nLastly, there was also an expert-led Safety and Security Panel to check out too.\nWomen’s Luncheon\nThe Women’s Networking Luncheon was a fun and resourceful event. Alexandra, Mryam, and Sinem from Microsoft’s team attended. Each table buzzed with interesting discussions: women in tech, inspirations to join the programming world, various work experiences, and ideas to inspire the next generation of women. With table rotations, attendees had the chance to talk to different people in the room. The relaxed atmosphere fostered connections among women from diverse companies and places who share an interest in C++ and programming.\nConclusion\nIt was great to meet many of you in person this year at CppCon. We enjoyed our time there and learned a lot from the C++ community and have taken back our learnings to our day-to-day work. If you didn’t get a chance to attend or missed out on some of the sessions, remember to check out all the CppCon talk on the conference’s YouTube channel as they get rolled out! We also made a playlist of past Microsoft CppCon sessions. We look forward to seeing you again next year.\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2024: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "pubDate": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 16:06:51 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Since the recent announcement of the Proxy 3 library, we have received much positive feedback, and there have been numerous inquiries regarding the library’s actual performance. Although the “Proxy” library is designed to be fast, fulfilling one of our six core missions, it is not immediately clear how fast “Proxy” can be across different platforms and scenarios.\nTo better understand the performance of the “Proxy” library, we designed 15 benchmarks, tested in four different environments, and automated them in our GitHub pipeline to generate benchmarking reports for every code change in the future. Everyone can download the reports and raw benchmarking data attached to each build. The rest of this article delves into the benchmarking details. The numbers shown below were generated from a recent CI build.\nIndirect Invocation\nBoth proxy objects and virtual functions can perform indirect invocations. However, since they have different semantics and memory layout, it should be interesting to see how they compare to each other.\nBecause make_proxy can effectively place a small object alongside metadata (similar to “small buffer optimization” in some other C++ libraries), the benchmarks are divided into two categories: invocation on small objects (4 bytes) and on large objects (48 bytes). By invoking 1,000,000 object of 100 different types, we got the first two rows of the report:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nIndirect invocation on small objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 261.7% faster\nproxy is about 44.6% faster\nproxy is about 71.6% faster\nproxy is about 4.0% faster\n\n\nIndirect invocation on large objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 186.1% faster\nproxy is about 15.5% faster\nproxy is about 17.0% faster\nproxy is about 10.5% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the report, proxy is faster in all four environments, especially on Windows Server. This result is expected because the implementation of proxy directly stores the metadata of the underlying object, making it more cache-friendly.\nLifetime Management\nIn many applications, lifetime management of various objects can become a performance hotspot compared to indirect invocations. We benchmarked this scenario by creating 600,000 small or large objects within a single std::vector (with reserved space).\nBesides proxy, there are three typical standard options for storing arbitrary types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::any. std::variant is not included because it is essentially a tagged union and can only provide storage for a known set of types (though useful in data context management).\nFor small objects, proxy and std::any usually won’t allocate additional storage. For large objects, proxy and std::shared_ptr offer allocator support (via pro::allocate_proxy and std::allocate_shared) to improve performance, while there is no direct API to customize std::unique_ptr or std::any.\nHere are the types we used in the benchmarks:\nSmall types\nLarge types\n\n\n\n\nint\nstd::array<char, 100>\n\n\nstd::shared_ptr<int>\nstd::array<std::string, 3>\n\n\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex>\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex> + void*[15]\n\n\n\nBy comparing proxy with other solutions, we got the following numbers:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 467.0% faster\nproxy is about 413.0% faster\nproxy is about 430.1% faster\nproxy is about 341.1% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (without memory pool)\nproxy is about 639.2% faster\nproxy is about 509.3% faster\nproxy is about 492.5% faster\nproxy is about 484.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (with memory pool)\nproxy is about 198.4% faster\nproxy is about 696.1% faster\nproxy is about 660.0% faster\nproxy is about 188.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::any\nproxy is about 55.3% faster\nproxy is about 311.0% faster\nproxy is about 323.0% faster\nproxy is about 18.3% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 17.4% faster\nproxy is about 14.8% faster\nproxy is about 29.7% faster\nproxy is about 6.3% slower\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 283.6% faster\nproxy is about 109.6% faster\nproxy is about 204.6% faster\nproxy is about 88.6% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both without memory pool)\nproxy is about 29.2% faster\nproxy is about 6.4% faster\nproxy is about 6.5% faster\nproxy is about 4.8% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both with memory pool)\nproxy is about 10.8% faster\nproxy is about 9.9% faster\nproxy is about 8.3% faster\nproxy is about 53.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 13.4% faster\nproxy is about 1.3% slower\nproxy is about 0.9% faster\nproxy is about 9.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 270.7% faster\nproxy is about 80.1% faster\nproxy is about 136.9% faster\nproxy is about 120.4% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the benchmarking results:\nproxy is much faster than any other 3 when the underlying object is small, or managed with memory pools.\nproxy is slightly slower than std::unique_ptr when the underlying object is large and not managed with a memory pool.\nThe performance of std::any varies in different environments, but is generally slower than proxy.\nSummary\nAlthough the test environments (GitHub-hosted runners) may differ from actual production environments, the test results show significant performance advantages of proxy in both indirect invocations and lifetime management. If you have more ideas for benchmarking the “Proxy” library, we welcome contributions to our GitHub repository.\nThe post Analyzing the Performance of the “Proxy” Library appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Amper 0.5.0 is now available! With this release, we’ve improved the IDE experience when working with multiple modules and project.yaml files, made nested completion in Amper configuration files more powerful, introduced support for Compose Resources and KSP2, improved Android release builds, and more!\nFor the full list of changes and bug fixes in Amper 0.5.0, see the release notes.\nTo get support for Amper’s latest features, use Fleet 1.42 or IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTooling support for working with modules and project files\nIn the previous update, we introduced project files for standalone Amper projects. With this release, you’ll now get additional tooling to work with these files.\nWhen working in the configuration file of a newly created module, you’ll see a warning and a quick-fix that helps you add it to the list of modules:\n\n\n\n\nWhen referencing a module that doesn’t exist yet, you can use a quick-fix to create that new module:\n\n\n\n\nImproved nested completion\nThe settings block in Amper files offers nested completion for all of the available values you can configure, letting you easily search for values even if you don’t know where in the structure they’re nested.\nTo make this even more convenient, you’ll now get this completion support even when you’re at the top level of a module file:\n\n\n\n\nCompose resources\nYou can now use Compose Multiplatform resources in standalone Amper projects, which allows you to easily access images, strings, fonts, and files in your Compose application.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure resources under settings.compose to change the package name or the visibility of the generated Res class:\nsettings:\n  compose:\n    enabled: true\n    resources:\n      packageName: com.example.app\n      exposedAccessors: true\nKotlin Symbol Processing\nThe standalone version of Amper now has support for Kotlin Symbol Processing. Many third-party libraries use KSP to generate code as part of the compilation process.\nAmper works with KSP2, so any processors used must be updated for KSP2 as well. We’re expecting most processors to make this upgrade soon, as KSP1 is deprecated and will no longer be supported in Kotlin 2.1. However, at the time of this release, you might still see some gaps in support, such as issues with native targets.\nTo add a processor to your module, use the settings.kotlin.ksp section. You can also specify the options that you want to pass to KSP here.\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\n      processorOptions:\n        room.schemaLocation: ./schema\nIn multiplatform modules, configuration in the settings block is applied to all platforms by default, including KSP processors. If you need to specify which platforms to run a KSP processor on, use a settings block with a platform qualifier:\nsettings@android:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\nAndroid release builds\nAmper can now create signed release builds of Android apps in both Gradle-based and standalone Amper projects. These builds will use R8 automatically, with minification and shrinking enabled.\nTo enable signing for release builds, use the new android.signing option in the settings block:\nsettings:\n  android:\n    signing: enabled\nYou can provide the signing details by creating a keystore.properties file in the module:\nstoreFile=/Users/example/.keystores/release.keystore\nstorePassword=store_password\nkeyAlias=alias\nkeyPassword=key_password\nThere are options available to customize R8’s obfuscation and to change the location of the properties file containing the signing details. Amper can also generate a new keystore for you if you don’t have one already.\nYou can refer to the documentation about configuring Android builds for more details, and you can also look at samples to see custom Proguard configuration in both standalone and Gradle-based Amper projects.\nParcelize support for Android\nIn projects using the standalone version of Amper, you can now turn on the Parcelize plugin for Android, using the new settings entry: \nsettings:\n  android:\n    parcelize: enabled\nThis lets you annotate Parcelable classes with @Parcelize to generate an implementation automatically:\nimport kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize\n\n@Parcelize\nclass User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable\nAs Parcelize is an Android-specific feature, it requires some additional configuration in multiplatform projects, which is described in the documentation.\nUpdated dependencies and defaults\nAmper now uses these new versions of dependencies and default values:\nKotlin 2.0.20\nKotlin language version 2.0\nAndroid Gradle Plugin 8.5.0\nAndroid compile SDK and target SDK 35\nThis release also uses kotlinx.serialization 1.7.3 by default and allows you to customize this version if needed:\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    serialization:\n      enabled: true\n      version: 1.7.3\nTo make it easier to set up serialization for various formats, the required dependencies are available from the built-in version catalog:\ndependencies:\n  - $kotlin.serialization.json\n  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf\nNew, unified cache folder\nThere is now a unified location for caching downloaded dependencies, whether Amper is invoked from the command line or used in an IDE. The ~/.amper folder that was used in previous versions can be safely deleted.\nThe new cache locations are as follows:\nOn Windows: ~/AppData/Local/Amper\nOn macOS: ~/Library/Caches/Amper\nOn Linux: ~/.cache/Amper (or if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined, $XDG_CACHE_HOME/.cache/Amper) \nUpdate your existing projects\nTo update a project using the standalone version of Amper, update your amper scripts by following the download instructions on the Usage page of the documentation.\nIf you’re using a Gradle-based Amper project, update your plugin version to 0.5.0:\nplugins {\n   id(\"org.jetbrains.amper.settings.plugin\").version(\"0.5.0\")\n}\nTry Amper\nTo get started with Amper, try the sample projects with standalone Amper or the samples with Gradle-based projects.\nFor full support of the latest Amper features, use Fleet 1.42 and IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTry Amper\n                                                    \nShare your feedback\nAmper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a YouTrack issue. Your input and your use cases help shape the future of Amper!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Java Annotated Monthly is here! Check out the latest news across Java, Spring, AI, and emerging technologies. We offer practical tutorials to enhance your skills, a curated list of November’s top tech events, both online and offline, and an exclusive feature by industry expert Mala Gupta.\nStay informed, and stay ahead!\nFeatured Content \nJava Developer Advocate with JetBrains, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Mala Gupta has authored multiple books with Manning, Packt, and O’Reilly Publications. She has more than two decades of experience in the software industry and is a regular speaker at industry conferences around the world. She is a vocal supporter of Java certification as a path to career advancement.\nIn this featured section, I want to highlight ‘JEP Explained‘ – a collection of heartfelt conversations with the Java architects and experts who helped bring Java 23 features to life. These conversations dive into JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), which are the key features planned for each JDK release. Our hope with this series is to help developers, teams, and anyone passionate about Java not just understand the new Java features, but to look beyond the syntax and dig into the bigger picture with behind-the-scenes stories and the experiences of experts. Here’s the link to the blog post and YouTube playlist.\nJava 23, released in September 2024, has twelve JEPs, and the ‘JEP Explained’ series covers eleven of them. Each conversation packs a bunch of information beyond the JEP itself. For instance, when we talked with Brian Goetz about JEP 455 (about the addition of primitive types to pattern matching), he also talked about balancing new features and complexity in software development, why compiler writers love pattern matching, how designing a feature is often a lesson in humility, and how the evolution of design is an organic process. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the complete interview for more insights from Brian, Aggelos Biboudis, and Tagir Valeev, as they all discuss the inclusion of primitive types in pattern matching.\n99% of developers I talked with believe that one of the reasons for deprecating an API in Java is the availability of better APIs. Ron Pressler stated this is never the case, when we talked with him about JEP 471 (deprecation of Memory-Access Methods in the sun.misc.Unsafe class). Ron also talked about ‘Tip and Tail: a smarter way to manage codebases for different JDKs’, whether folks are swimming naked when they use outdated code, the real secret to performance gains, and much more. Check out this conversation with Ron for more insights.\nWe had another interesting conversation with Viktor Klang and Tagir Valeev about Stream Gatherers in the Streams API. Apart from discussing JEP 473, Viktor touched on topics such as ‘The Power of Simplicity in Software Design’ and how bugs can’t hide in simplicity. He shared how the built-in gatherers can inspire folks, show what this feature can do, help them to get started using them, and then help them create custom gatherers. Viktor also shared why he loves to use JShell for prototyping. Tagir shared that the most complex code that he has ever written was for a Stream API library that he created, streamex. Check out the full interview for more stories.\nIt was a pleasure to talk about being able to use Markdown for writing documentation comments in JavaDoc with Jonathan Gibbons, owner of JEP 467, and Dmitry Chuyko. Jonathan talked about making Java more approachable by simplifying its documentation with Markdown. He discussed why Markdown is a game changer for JavaDoc and addressed which Markdown flavor to use. Dmitry talked about a challenge related to documentation at work – what happens when the documentation of a codebase is larger than its codebase? Check out the full interview here.\nIt was an honor and a privilege to interview all of these Java architects and experts for the JEP Explained interview series: Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, Ken Fogel, Rafael Winterhalter, José Paumard, Zoran Sevarac, Monica Beckwith, Paul Bakker, and Gavin Bierman.\nThough I would have loved to, it is not feasible to highlight all of the fantastic “aha!” moments and learning I experienced while talking with all the guests. Check out the playlist of JEP Explained interviews and this blog post for more details.\nJava News\nJava News Roundup 1, 2, 3, 4 – As usual, the most detailed news digest on all things Java is here.\nThe Inside Java Newsletter: Welcome Java 23! – All the news about the recent release of Java 23 and the related events is conveniently grouped here.\nCheck out some helpful info on the JEPs in progress: \nJEP 14: The Tip & Tail Model of Library Development\nJEP 485: Stream Gatherers\nJEP 484: Class-File API\nJEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1\nJEP 489: Vector API (9th Incubator)\nJEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI\nBig News from Project Valhalla – Inside Java Newscast #77 – Nicolai Parlog discusses Project Valhalla’s latest draft proposal, which introduces value classes, null-restricted types, and other enhancements.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As a language that emerged over 14 years ago, Go has many use cases. From web development, APIs, and CLIs to Wasm, cloud technologies, and even AI-powered tools, its applications are broad. \nThe same goes for demo projects, which have countless variations and purposes!\nNow, wouldn’t it be great if there was a full-stack, API-oriented, and well-maintained demo project for Go? If you’ve ever experienced a demo project fail during a live presentation, then you’d certainly appreciate a more stable project! \nIn this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of creating such a project – a full-stack app using Go and React.\nCheck out the source code here to follow along.\nIntroducing Go Eats\nGo Eats is an open-source project similar to the food delivery apps you’ve probably seen and used before. The project simulates the operations involved when placing an order in a real-world food delivery app.\nTo build Go Eats, I used Go as the programming language, Postgres as the database, React for the frontend, and NATS for messaging. While Go is a good choice for these complex full-stack applications, finding demos can be challenging.\nI used GoLand for this project because it takes care of setting up the Go SDK, installing packages, and much more straight out of the box.\nLet’s take a closer look at the entry point of the source code: main.go. \nThis code initializes several services and handlers, establishes a database connection, loads environment variables, and sets up middleware, NATS, and the WebSocket.\nfunc main() {\n\t// load .env file\n\terr := godotenv.Load()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Error loading .env file\")\n\t}\n\n\tenv := os.Getenv(\"APP_ENV\")\n\tdb := database.New()\n\t// Create Tables\n\tif err := db.Migrate(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error migrating database: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Connect NATS\n\tnatServer, err := nats.NewNATS(\"nats://127.0.0.1:4222\")\n\n\t// WebSocket Clients\n\twsClients := make(map[string]*websocket.Conn)\n\n\ts := handler.NewServer(db, true)\n\n\t// Initialize Validator\n\tvalidate := validator.New()\n\n\t// Middlewares List\n\tmiddlewares := []gin.HandlerFunc{middleware.AuthMiddleware()}\n\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\n\n\tlog.Fatal(s.Run())\n\n}\nThe journey\nI started by working on backend tasks, such as creating APIs, before moving to the frontend. I chose Gin as the framework to build these APIs.\nWhile I could have gone with Gorilla, Echo, Fiber, or any other framework, I felt Gin would be a better choice for this project. It’s more mature and stable, it’s widely used, and it’s also somewhat of a personal preference. \nBefore selecting any framework, you should carefully consider the problem you are trying to solve or the specific business goal you are trying to achieve. Then weigh up the potential solutions and opt for the best one for your specific use case.\nThe backend\nWhile creating a demo app, it’s important to ensure that the application is flexible enough to accommodate future changes and refactoring.\nFor Go Eats, I implemented a service layer pattern, along with dependency injection. Additionally, I utilized handlers for request and response communication with the service layer, which manages business logic and interacts with the database.\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t// Reviews\n\treviewService := review.NewReviewService(db, env)\n\trevw.NewReviewProtectedHandler(s, \"/review\", reviewService, middlewares, validate)\n\n\t// Cart\n\tcartService := cart_order.NewCartService(db, env, natServer)\n\tcrt.NewCartHandler(s, \"/cart\", cartService, middlewares, validate)\nThe project structure shown above ensures that the project is modular and flexible. Remember that creating too many nested directories can add unnecessary complexity. Especially if you’re just starting your programming journey, it’s best to focus on simplicity rather than going through multiple layers. Keep in mind that your code will inevitably need to be refactored at some point.\nThe famous quote by Donald Knuth, “Premature optimization is the root of all evil,” feels particularly apt here.\n\nI did something similar for the database. I used the lightweight Bun SQL client. \nHowever, I made sure that if I need to replace the ORM in the future, my code will be able to adapt to the new changes based on the interface I have defined below.\ntype Database interface {\n\tInsert(ctx context.Context, model any) (sql.Result, error)\n\tDelete(ctx context.Context, tableName string, filter Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tSelect(ctx context.Context, model any, columnName string, parameter any) error\n\tSelectAll(ctx context.Context, tableName string, model any) error\n\tSelectWithRelation(ctx context.Context, model any, relations []string, Condition Filter) error\n\tSelectWithMultipleFilter(ctx context.Context, model any, Condition Filter) error\n\tRaw(ctx context.Context, model any, query string, args ...interface{}) error\n\tUpdate(ctx context.Context, tableName string, Set Filter, Condition Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tCount(ctx context.Context, tableName string, ColumnExpression string, columnName string, parameter any) (int64, error)\n\tMigrate() error\n\tHealthCheck() bool\n\tClose() error\n}\nThis interface provides a blueprint for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations and other common database interactions, ensuring that any struct implementing this interface can be used to perform these operations.\nGoLand keeps track of class implementation, making navigation much smoother. \nTo navigate to the implementation, press ⌘⌥B / Ctrl+Alt+B.\n\nMost of the operations involve CRUD activities. I was also eager to experiment with server-sent events (SSE) and WebSockets, which I’ve not explored much in the past. This project was a good use case for these technologies.\nLet’s begin with SSE, a technology that enables the server to push notifications, messages, and events to clients over an HTTP connection.\nThe code snippet below reads data from a JSON file and pushes the information so the client renders and displays the relevant data. \nfunc (s *AnnouncementHandler) flashNews(c *gin.Context) {\n\t_, cancel := context.WithTimeout(c.Request.Context(), 5*time.Second)\n\tdefer cancel()\n\n\tevents, err := s.service.FlashEvents()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tc.AbortWithStatusJSON(500, gin.H{\"error\": err.Error()})\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Set headers for SSE\n\tc.Header(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\")\n\tc.Header(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-cache\")\n\tc.Header(\"Connection\", \"keep-alive\")\n\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(6 * time.Second)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\teventIndex := 0\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\t// Send the current event\n\t\t\tevent := (*events)[eventIndex]\n\t\t\tc.SSEvent(\"message\", event.Message)\n\t\t\tc.Writer.Flush()\n\n\t\t\t// Move to the next event\n\t\t\teventIndex = (eventIndex + 1) % len(*events)\n\t\tcase <-c.Request.Context().Done():\n\t\t\tticker.Stop()\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nWebSocket and NATS\nSomething else I’ve not worked with before but have always wanted to try is using WebSockets with the NATS messaging system. I evaluated these technologies as potential solutions for the project and ultimately decided to use them in the demo app.\nHere’s how the messaging process in the Go Eats app functions: \nWhenever a new order is created, a message is published to NATS informing the subscriber about the newly placed order.\nWhen the delivery person updates the order – whether it’s on the way, has failed, or has been delivered – the customer will receive this information in real time, a process that will be reflected in the UI.\n\nThe code below defines the two topics:\norders.new.*: Sends a notification to the customer when a new order is placed.\norders.status.*: Sends a notification to the customer when the delivery status is updated.\n\n\n\n\nFor each received message, the application logs the message, extracts the user ID and message data, and attempts to send the data to the corresponding WebSocket client. If sending fails, the app logs the error, closes the WebSocket connection, and removes the client from the active client’s map.\nNote: Using map[string]*websocket.Conn to manage WebSocket connections with keys as client identifiers, such as userID, will not handle multiple connections from the same client, as the map keys must be unique. This is something I am planning to expand on in a future blog post. \nWhy NATS over Kafka?\nKafka is capable of handling large amounts of data, offering database-level durability and being enterprise-ready. \nHowever, I have never used it before, and I needed something that would work well for my specific use case. In that context, I came across NATS, which is written in Go and is ideal for lightweight, low-latency messaging, particularly in microservices and cloud-native architectures. \nA key point I would like to highlight is its simplicity. NATS was easy to use even when just starting to work with it.\nThe code below initializes a NATS connection and defines methods to publish and subscribe to messages. It connects to a NATS server, publishes messages to a topic, and forwards received messages to WebSocket clients based on user IDs.\ntype NATS struct {\n\tConn *nats.Conn\n}\n\nfunc NewNATS(url string) (*NATS, error) {\n\tnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.Name(\"food-delivery-nats\"))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error connecting to NATS:: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\treturn &NATS{Conn: nc}, err\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Pub(topic string, message []byte) error {\n\terr := n.Conn.Publish(topic, message)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Sub(topic string, clients map[string]*websocket.Conn) error {\n\n\t_, err := n.Conn.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n\t\tmessage := string(msg.Data)\n\t\tslog.Info(\"MESSAGE_REPLY_FROM_NATS\", \"RECEIVED_MESSAGE\", message)\n\t\tuserId, messageData := n.formatMessage(message)\n\t\tif conn, ok := clients[userId]; ok {\n\t\t\terr := conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(messageData))\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Error sending message to client:\", err)\n\t\t\t\tconn.Close()\n\t\t\t\tdelete(clients, userId)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\nThe frontend\nTo build the Go Eats UI, I used React. I don’t come from a frontend background, and it was quite challenging to learn and apply unfamiliar concepts. Along the way, I took Stephen Grider’s Modern React with Redux course.\nWhile I’m certainly no expert in React, the course helped a lot. That said, it was the use of GoLand, the JetBrains IDE for Go, which proved to be most valuable throughout this process.\nGoLand has excellent support for full-stack development with less distraction and context switching. The IDE provides exceptional coding support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, React, and many other languages.\nUsing GoLand, I can develop frontend and backend applications with the same IDE.\n\nFinally, here is the final output of how the UI gets rendered through React. \n\nI haven’t gone into much detail about the process of developing the Go Eats frontend. However, if you’re interested, you can check out the source code here. \nSummary\nAs I reflect on my journey developing this demo app, I realize there is much to learn and many improvements that could be made.\nHere are some key lessons from this experience:\nFocus on functionality first!\nIf you’re someone who is just starting to work with Go, don’t worry about making your app scalable or more modular by focusing on dependency injection right away. These concepts will eventually be required, and you will observe the patterns and restructure accordingly. Whatever you build, it won’t be perfect at first, and that’s okay! The journey is one of incremental and constant improvements. \n\n\n\n\nPrioritize testing!\nDon’t forget the importance of regular testing. Making sure you test your project frequently provides confidence that your features work as expected. While I have worked on tests for Go Eats, I still need to improve them further. Additionally, I have tried different testing libraries, such as Testcontainers, which help me test features in a real database instead of using mock ones.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase design matters!\nSpending time on the database schema is extremely valuable. Additionally, there are database migrations, which I haven’t used, but they are quite important, especially when you’re looking for rollbacks, versioning changes, and ensuring that changes are applied in the correct order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I’m happy with what I’ve built so far, it’s just the beginning for Go Eats. Stay tuned for more updates soon! \nI’d also love to hear your feedback. If you’ve had similar experiences or if you have thoughts on what you liked or disliked, or if you have suggestions for improvement, please share them in the comments.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "On October 20, the original author of the Fernflower Java decompiler, Stiver, passed away after a long fight against glioblastoma. \nStiver was a German programmer of Russian origin, primarily developing software for medical equipment. Twenty years ago, he developed a deep professional interest in Java virtual machine internals. You may remember his research blog posts, like this one (in Russian) from 2006 about how to tweak the Java class hierarchy using Unsafe when Java 1.5 was just released. Around 2008, Stiver became fascinated by Java decompilation.\nThe Java decompilation landscape was very poor at that time. The first generation of decompilers like JAD or JODE came to an end. While Java as a language evolved, the existing decompilers were mainly unmaintained, which limited their usefulness. New language constructs like assertion statements, annotations, and generic types were not supported. Moreover, the deprecation of JSR/RET instructions in Java bytecode caused a significant difference in how try-finally blocks are compiled. The decompilers failed to handle the new bytecode.\nAnother big problem with existing decompilers was their approach to decompilation. They simply looked for specific bytecode patterns and translated them to the corresponding Java statements and expressions. While simple, this approach is fragile – any minor semantically equivalent change in generated bytecode made proper decompilation impossible. This severely limited the decompiler application.\nStiver decided to write his own decompiler as a side project. To overcome the weaknesses of existing alternatives, he took a different approach. After reading the bytecode, he constructed a control-flow graph in static single-assignment form, which is much better to express the program semantics abstracting the particular shape of bytecode. At the beginning of this project, Stiver knew little about static analysis and compiler design and had to learn a lot, but the effort was worth it. The resulting decompiler produced much better results than anything available at that time. It could even decompile the bytecode produced by some obfuscators without any explicit support.\nStiver did the main development himself between 2008 and 2010. The first public version became available in May 2009 as a web service. A user could upload an individual CLASS file or a whole JAR file and get the decompiled result. The decompiler quickly gained popularity – during the first four months, users decompiled more than half a million Java classes. There was no public standalone version, but Stiver sent it privately to a few Beta testers. After the release, Stiver made numerous improvements and fixed many bugs thanks to early adopters.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 2010, the active development of the decompiler stopped, as Stiver became busier with his primary job. A few third-party software vendors asked Stiver to provide the decompiler for their projects. Notably, it was used with permission in Mod Coder Pack, which is a toolkit for creating mods for the game Minecraft. Still, it became difficult for a regular Java user to find a working version of Fernflower.\nIn 2013, JetBrains approached Stiver with a suggestion to include Fernflower in IntelliJ IDEA. Part of the deal was making Fernflower open source. Everything went well, and the contract was signed. On July 11, 2014, the early access version of IntelliJ IDEA 14 was released, including the decompiler for the first time. You can still see the initial import of the Fernflower source code in the IntelliJ IDEA Git history, on March 4, 2014.\nWhile Stiver was never a JetBrains employee, he helped improve the decompiler for almost a year after the initial import. As Java 8 had just been released, it was necessary to support new language constructs like lambdas. Another big challenge was integrating the decompiler with the IntelliJ IDEA debugger. Line numbers in decompiled code differ from line numbers in the original source, and Stiver helped provide a transparent mapping between them so you can seamlessly debug decompiled code.\n\n\n\n\nAs Fernflower became open source, many other tools in the Java world used it – you can find a number of forks on GitHub. The Java team at JetBrains is constantly improving Fernflower, but it’s still mainly Stiver’s code. If Fernflower hadn’t existed, we likely would have had to invest substantial resources into developing our own decompiler. This could have resulted in IntelliJ IDEA lacking a decompiler or having one that was significantly less effective. Stiver’s work was a real game-changer for Java developers over the past 10 years. With no better alternative to decompile Java bytecode, his contributions have saved developers countless hours while debugging Java code without sources. \nThank you, Stiver! We are deeply saddened by the loss of such a brilliant pioneer whose work and dedication had such a lasting and profound impact.",

This enhancement aims to improve performance by reducing the overhead of initializing cURL handles each time. \n        Quoting Matthieu Napoli, the author of Bref, here:\n\n        Most PHP apps spend most of their time doing IO (not using the CPU). … But calling APIs (via HTTP) can take a very long time. Very different orders of magnitude.\n        Why? Because it establishes a TPC and HTTPS connection every time. That can take 100ms or 200ms (HTTPS is bonkers). On *every* request, because PHP (with FPM) recreates a connection every time. \n        That’s why switching to Laravel Octane or Symfony Runtime makes such a difference sometimes: by keeping the PHP process alive between requests, we can save these 100ms. Comparing that to what we save on the framework boot time, this is massive. \n        The RFC proposes to share HTTP connections between requests in PHP-FPM: that’s huge because it could bring some of these gains to all PHP apps out there, without having to switch to Octane/Runtime (and the downsides that come with it).\n        \n\n        And to further prove the point, here are a couple of real-world use cases and workarounds:\nWikipedia team: Impact of using HTTP connection pooling for PHP applications at scale.\nBedrock team: Increase performance and stability by adding an Egress Controller in a Kubernetes cluster at AWS.\n📣 RFC: Change behaviour of array sort functions to return a copy of the sorted array\n        Currently, PHP’s array sort functions take the array to sort by reference, modifying the original array in place. However, these functions always return `true` which often makes them not so convenient to use. \n        Gina Banyard proposes changing the return value of these functions sort(), rsort(), asort(), arsort(), ksort(), krsort(), natsort(), natcasesort(), usort(), uasort(), uksort(), array_multisort(), shuffle(), array_walk(), array_walk_recursive() from true to a copy of the array. \n        This change would allow for a more functional programming style, enabling to chain these functions and work with immutable data more easily.\n    \n✅ RFC: Change Directory class to behave like an opaque object\n    \n📣 RFC: Warn on conversions from resource to string\n    \nTools\nComposer 2.8.0\n--patch-only flag: This allows you to limit updates to patch-level changes, minimizing the risk of introducing breaking changes.\nAbility to explicitly decide if additional arguments/options should be passed to the underlying command.\nimliam/cpx – It’s like `npx` but for PHP.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In IntelliJ IDEA, you can leverage AI Assistant’s capabilities within Database Tools for more efficient data querying and handling. It can significantly speed up SQL query generation, explain code, suggest fixes, and even create tables and populate them with test data on your command! Let’s get started!\nGet IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate\nTo enable the AI Assistant plugin, navigate to View | Tool Windows | AI Assistant or Settings | Plugins | Marketplace | AI Assistant.\nIn-editor AI actions\nGenerate SQL code in the editor\nAI Assistant can generate SQL code right in the query console, which is accessible via the Database Tools window.\n\n\n\n\nSimply click on the AI Assistant icon or invoke it using ⌘\\ (macOS) or Ctrl+\\ (Windows/Linux), write your request in the input field, and watch AI Assistant transform your words into precise SQL code.\n\n\n\n\nModify existing SQL code\nYou can also alter existing SQL queries by following the same steps. Just select a block of code, call the AI Assistant’s input field, and type in the changes or additions you would like to make to your current query.\n\n\n\n\nTest data tables\nAI Assistant can create tables and populate them with sample data right in the editor. Click the AI Assistant icon to open the Generate Code with AI dialog and ask AI Assistant to, for example, “Add queries that will create a books table and populate it with three sample rows”.\n\n\n\n\nAfter AI Assistant generates the code, you can preview and apply the result.\n\n\n\n\nCloud completion\nAI-powered cloud completion autocompletes code in real time based on the context of your SQL query. You don’t need to perform any extra actions to invoke cloud completion in a console, as it’s enabled by default – just keep on querying!\n\n\n\n\nChat with AI\nIn the chat, you can ask AI Assistant any database or query-related question, get it to perform actions, and so much more!\nTip: Use /explain or /refactor with #thisFile for quick and precise responses in the current context.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the DDL of two tables\nIn the chat, you can also tell AI Assistant to compare the DDL of two tables to get a detailed response highlighting the differences between the tables’ structures. In our example, we use the following prompt: “compare the DDL of actor and film_actor tables”.\n\n\n\n\nAI Assistant will generate a detailed comparison analyzing primary keys, columns, indexes, foreign keys, default values, and constraints. It will even give you a summary:\n\n\n\n\nOptimize the query’s performance using Explain Plan\nExplain Plan is crucial for maintaining robust, scalable database applications by providing insights into how queries are executed. AI Assistant can help identify issues with a query and optimize its overall performance.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, run Explain Plan for a query. Right-click an SQL statement and select Explain Plan | Explain Plan (Raw) from the context menu. Then, copy and paste the results into a chat with a request for analysis and optimization. The initial cost in our example is 93.22..134.83.\n\n\n\n\nAI Assistant will suggest an optimized query code, which you can insert into the console right away by clicking on Insert Snippet at Caret.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now run the Explain Plan command once again and check the cost. Our example now shows the lower cost of 52.80..94.62.\n\n\n\n\nAI prompts\nTo invoke a list of AI prompts, right-click an SQL statement or press ⌥↩ (macOS) or Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux), select AI Actions from the context menu, and choose an action you’d like to perform.\n\n\n\n\nExplain a query\nIt’s pretty straightforward: Explain Code gives you context-aware explanations within your database environment.\n\n\n\n\nRefactor SQL code\nSelect Suggest Refactoring from the context menu, and AI Assistant will provide a refactored piece of code alongside an explanation of why these changes would work better.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check both versions side by side by clicking on Show Diff or selecting Apply Immediately to accept the changes right away.\n\n\n\n\nFind problems and suggest a fix\nAI Assistant can find and fix problems with SQL queries. Select Find Problems from the AI actions list and AI Assistant will provide an explanation in the chat.\n\n\n\n\nYou can then ask AI Assistant to fix the code right in the chat.\nAdd your own prompts\nYou can add custom prompts and use them via the AI Actions menu. You can set this up by going to Settings | Tools | AI Assistant | Prompt Library and clicking +.\n\n\n\n\nModify tables\nAI Assistant can help you modify tables. Call the Modify dialog by right-clicking on the table in the Database Tools window and selecting Modify Table. Click the AI Assistant icon and type in your request, for example: “Switch all the VARCHAR data types to CHAR”.\n\n\n\n\nOnce AI Assistant generates the requested code, you’ll be able to view it in the preview pane of the dialog and then accept the suggestion.\nAll these AI Assistant features can greatly enhance your productivity when working with Database Tools. \nPreviously we looked into the basics of Database Tools and how simple shortcuts can make querying data more efficient.

The class that controls the expansion is this one: OutliningMarginHeaderControl\n\nA quick internet search for the class name led me to this reference article for OutliningMarginHeaderControl Class where the definition contains the following valuable information:\nNamespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor\nAssembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nPackage: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187\nNow that we know where to find this class, it’s time to examine the assembly. For that we will use the excellent ILSpy tool, which you can install from the Microsoft Store: ILSpy Fresh\nOnce you’ve installed ILSpy, launch it and load the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll. You can find this assembly in the Visual Studio installation folder, usually in the following path:\n<VSInstallDir>\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\Editor\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nAfter the assembly is loaded, search for the class OutliningMarginHeaderControl in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor namespace and you will find the following code for the static constructor:\n\nThis is where the default style key for the control is being set. The next step is to find the XAML Style for the control. For that we open the Resources node where we find themes/generic.baml, which includes the entire style for the OutliningMarginHeaderControl:\n\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n    <Style.Resources> \r\n      <ResourceDictionary> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandRight\">F1M2.146.146a.5.5,0,0,1,.708,0l4,4a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708-.708L5.793,4.5,2.146.854A.5.5,0,0,1,2.146.146Z</Geometry> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandDown\">F1M8.854,2.146a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708,0l-4-4a.5.5,0,0,1,.708-.708L4.5,5.793,8.146,2.146A.5.5,0,0,1,8.854,2.146Z</Geometry> \r\n      </ResourceDictionary> \r\n    </Style.Resources> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"FrameworkElement.Cursor\" Value=\"Hand\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Template\"> \r\n      <Setter.Value> \r\n        <ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\"> \r\n          <Grid> \r\n            <Viewbox Name=\"ExpandCollapseIcon\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"> \r\n              <Border Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.background}\"> \r\n                <Rectangle Name=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"9\"> \r\n                  <FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                    <ResourceDictionary> \r\n                      <SolidColorBrush x:Key=\"canvas\" Opacity=\"0\" /> \r\n                    </ResourceDictionary> \r\n                  </FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                  <Shape.Fill> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                      <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandRight}\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush> \r\n                  </Shape.Fill> \r\n                </Rectangle> \r\n              </Border> \r\n            </Viewbox> \r\n          </Grid> \r\n          <ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n            <Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\"> \r\n              <Setter TargetName=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Property=\"Shape.Fill\"> \r\n                <Setter.Value> \r\n                  <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                      <DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandDown}\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingGroup> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                  </DrawingBrush> \r\n                </Setter.Value> \r\n              </Setter> \r\n            </Trigger> \r\n          </ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n        </ControlTemplate> \r\n      </Setter.Value> \r\n    </Setter> \r\n</Style> \r\n\nThis is the style for the new chevron symbols. Here we find interesting things like the geometry for the expand/collapse symbols, the colors, and the trigger that changes the symbol when the control is expanded. The next step is to find the original Style for the plus/minus symbols. For that we can either use an older VS installation or we can take advantage of the reference information above, which states that this control is included in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187 NuGet package. Now we know that the symbols changed in 17.9, so we will look for a version before that. For example, the last one before that is 17.8.222.\nWe can download the package, change its extension from .nupkg to .zip, and extract the assembly from the lib\\net472 folder. Once we have the assembly, we can load it in ILSpy and look for the original style for the control just like we did before:\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" />\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Template\">\r\n\t\t<Setter.Value>\r\n\t\t\t<ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"WhitePadding\" Height=\"11\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" BorderThickness=\"0,1,0,1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"TheSquare\" Height=\"9\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.verticalrule.foreground}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.background}\" BorderThickness=\"1\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line X1=\"1\" Y1=\"3.5\" X2=\"6\" Y2=\"3.5\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line Name=\"Vertical\" X1=\"3.5\" Y1=\"1\" X2=\"3.5\" Y2=\"6\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"Vertical\" Property=\"Visibility\" Value=\"Hidden\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"TheSquare\" Value=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Property=\"Border.Background\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Trigger>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t</ControlTemplate>\r\n\t\t</Setter.Value>\r\n\t</Setter>\r\n</Style>\r\n\nSince the new style no longer uses dynamic resources for outlining.square, we must assume that these resources are no longer available in the new version of VS. This means that we needed to replace these resources with other colors. For the foreground outlining.chevron.foreground made sense. The background was a little bit harder because outlining.chevron.background didn’t do anything. With a little experimenting I had settled on outlining.collapsehintadornment.background for the first version of the extension. Both were not ideal or what they used to be – the chevron foreground is quite a bit darker and the background for the plus symbol is a lot lighter than before, but this combination worked in both light and dark themes, and any other existing color resources would look wrong in one theme or another.\nHow to build a VSIX extension to override the style\nTo override the style, I started by creating a new VSIX project with an async package:\n\nThen I added a new ResourceDictionary file Style.xaml to the project and copied the style from the old assembly, pasted it into the ResourceDictionary, and updated it with the new color resource value. Make sure that the Build Action for this Style.xaml is set to Page. I also gave this style a key x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\", so that I can easily look it up later:\n\r\n<ResourceDictionary\r\n\txmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n\txmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\r\n\txmlns:textUiWpf=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor;assembly=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf\">\r\n\t<Style x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\" TargetType=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl\">\r\n\t\t...\r\n\nThe last thing that needed to be done was to override the style in the InitializeAsync method of the package. The following code loads the resource dictionary, looks up the style by its key, and places it in the current application’s resources using the implicit style key typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl), so that Visual Studio will find this Style first:\n\r\nprotected override async Task InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress progress) \r\n{ \r\n\t// When initialized asynchronously, the current thread may be a background thread at this point. \r\n\t// Do any initialization that requires the UI thread after switching to the UI thread. \r\n\tawait this.JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync(cancellationToken); \r\n\tvar resourceDictionary = new ResourceDictionary(); \r\n\tresourceDictionary.Source = new Uri(\"pack://application:,,,/BringBackPlusMinus;component/Style.xaml\"); \r\n\tvar style = resourceDictionary[\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\"]; \r\n\tApplication.Current.Resources[typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl)] = style; \r\n}\r\n\nBuilding and running the project launched the experimental instance of Visual Studio and voila – the plus/minus symbols were back!\nNow all that was left to do was to update the vsixmanifest, build the extension in Release mode, and upload it to the Visual Studio Marketplace following this Walkthrough: Publish a Visual Studio extension.\nAdding support for color customization\nWhen I started using the preview builds of Visual Studio 2022 17.12, I noticed that the rendering of the plus/minus symbols was broken because the chevron symbol color definition had changed. I decided to introduce a dedicated color definition for the plus/minus symbols to avoid such problems going forward:\n\r\n[Export(typeof(EditorFormatDefinition))] \r\n[Name(OutliningExpanderIdentifier)] \r\n[UserVisible(true)] \r\ninternal sealed class OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition : EditorFormatDefinition \r\n{ \r\n\tpublic const string OutliningExpanderIdentifier = \"outlining.plusminus\"; \r\n\tpublic OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition() \r\n\t{ \r\n\t\tthis.ForegroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0x55, 0x55, 0x55); \r\n\t\tthis.BackgroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0xE2, 0xE2, 0xE2); \r\n\t\tthis.DisplayName = Strings.OutliningMarginPlusMinus; \r\n\t} \r\n}\r\n\nAs an added benefit the colors are now consistent with the original plus/minus symbols, and they can be customized in Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors:\n\nTo make sure that the colors look correct in the dark theme as well, I added a ThemeColors.xml file to the project with the following content:\n\r\n<Themes> \r\n\t<Theme Name=\"Dark\" GUID=\"{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}\"> \r\n\t\t<Category Name=\"BringBackPlusMinus\" GUID=\"{063E9575-C1A8-4729-BB15-AAA2EFB44FC0}\"> \r\n\t\t\t<Color Name=\"outlining.plusminus\"> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" /> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Foreground Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFE2E2E2\" /> \r\n\t\t\t</Color> \r\n\t\t</Category> \r\n\t</Theme> \r\n</Themes>\r\n\nIt needs to be converted to a .pkgdef file using the VsixColorCompiler first, which is then included in the extension’s .vsixmanifest.\nConclusion\nIn summary, with a little bit of detective work we were able to locate the style for the outlining symbols, build a VSIX extension, and override the style with the original style that brings back the original plus/minus outlining buttons.\nThe source code for the extension is available on GitHub.\nThe post The making of Bring Back Plus/Minus appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

= null,\n    val email: Email,\n    var amount: Double\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            email: String,\n            amount: Double\n        ): Order {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(amount > 0) { \"Amount must be greater than zero\" }\n\n            return Order(\n                email = Email(email),\n                id = null,\n                amount = amount\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nValue Class를 통한 객체 관리의 이점\n\n명확한 타입 정의: Email이라는 값 클래스를 사용함으로써, 이메일 주소를 단순히 문자열로 다루는 대신 명확한 타입으로 관리할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 이메일 값이 기대하는 형태로만 사용되도록 강제할 수 있습니다.\n유효성 검사 통합: 이메일과 관련된 유효성 검사 로직을 Email 클래스 내부에 정의함으로써, 이메일이 생성되는 모든 곳에서 일관된 유효성 검사를 적용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드 중복을 줄이고 유지보수성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n가독성 향상: 이메일과 같은 값 타입을 별도로 정의함으로써, 코드의 가독성을 높이고, 객체의 의미를 보다 명확하게 전달할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드가 더 직관적이며 이해하기 쉬워집니다.\n재사용성: Email 클래스는 User 클래스뿐만 아니라, 예를 들어 Order와 같은 다른 도메인 객체에서도 재사용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 일관된 이메일 관리와 유효성 검사를 보장하며, 코드 중복을 최소화할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 공통적으로 사용되는 값 타입을 재사용함으로써 코드의 유지보수성과 확장성을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다.\n\nValue Class 사용 시 주의 사항\nvalue class로 감싼 타입은 JPA나 MongoDB와 같은 데이터베이스 접근 라이브러리를 사용할 때 자동으로 매핑되지 않기 때문에, 적절한 컨버터를 정의해줘야 합니다. 예를 들어, JPA에서는 AttributeConverter를 사용하여 Email 클래스를 문자열로 변환하고 다시 복원할 수 있는 컨버터를 구현해야 합니다.\n결론\n코틀린에서 객체를 생성하는 다양한 방법이 있지만, 제약 사항이 많은 경우에는 companion object와 invoke 연산자를 활용하는 방식이 매우 유용합니다. 또한, 값 타입을 별도로 관리하기 위해 value class를 사용하는 것도 좋은 접근법입니다. 이를 통해 외부에서 설정하지 말아야 할 필드를 보호하고, 객체 생성 시 발생할 수 있는 오류를 줄일 수 있으며, 값 타입에 대한 유효성 검사와 관리도 일관되게 할 수 있습니다.\n여러분도 코틀린을 사용할 때, 이러한 안전한 객체 생성 방식과 값 타입 관리를 적용해보세요! 필요에 따라 객체의 생성 로직을 유연하고 안전하게 제어할 수 있을 것입니다.",

CCR은 포트리스2로 유명한 회사였지만, 첫 면접이다 보니 준비하는 방법을 잘 몰랐다고 보는 게 맞을 거 같다.\n면접을 보러 가서 막상 질문은 아주 무난했다.\n최근에 읽은 책, C++ 기초 질문 후에 30분도 안 되서 면접이 끝났다.\n정확한 사유는 듣지 못했지만, 아주 떨려서 어버버 했고, 아마도 긴장해서 대화가 매끄럽게 이어지지 않아서 1시간의 반도 못 채우고 마무리 되었던 게 아닐까 싶다.\n그렇게 긴장 가득했던 첫 면접이 끝났다.\n내가 무엇이 부족한지 명확히 인지하지는 못했지만, 그래도 조금 더 후기도 찾아보고, 정보를 찾아가며 면접 대비를 하기 시작했다.\n당시에 페이퍼 코딩 또는, 필기 시험을 보는 회사가 종종 있었고, Quick Sort와 Linked List를 준비해두면 도움이 될거라는 말을 듣고 열심히 준비했고, 첫 구직 때는 아니었지만 이후에 종종 써먹을 수 있어서 좋았다.\nQuick Sort를 짤 수 있게 되면, 자연스레 더 쉬운 정렬들은 자연스레 외워진다는 장점이 있지만, 핸드 코딩 과정이나 페이퍼 코딩 과정에서 실수 할 수 있다는 단점이 있었는데, 컴파일러를 쓸 수 없는 환경인 만큼 조금의 오타나 버그가 있어도, 메커니즘을 이해했다는 것이 느껴지면 합격 점수를 주셨던 거 같다.\n여러 면접 후기 등으로 널리 퍼진 문제 등을 통한 면접 대비도 대비지만, 면접 횟수가 늘면서 면접이라는 시간을 덜 긴장하게 된 것도 영향이 있었을 테고, 한 달 정도의 구직 기간 끝에 당시 몇 년간 운영해오던 온라인 게임의 클라이언트 개발자로 업무를 시작하게 됐다.\n그리고 한참이 지난 지금의 결론은, 결국 첫 면접은 잘 못볼 확률이 높기 때문에, 면접 복기와, 면접 횟수를 최대한 늘려서 면접 스킬과, 자신만의 면접 노하우를 쌓는 것이 중요하다고 생각한다.\n첫 면접에 이어 구직 과정의 몇몇 회사의 질문 중 하나로 받게 되었던 20년 후의 내 미래인 나는 여전히 코딩을 하고 있다.\n20년 전 만큼은 아니지만 여전히 코딩이 재밌고, 성취감도 있고, 성장하고 배우는 것도 많게 느낀다.\n언제까지 내가 일할 수 있을지는 잘 모르겠지만, 적어도 아직은 행복한 마음으로 프로그래밍을 해오고 있다.\n그래서 지금까지 해올 수 있었던 거 같고, 앞으로도 더 오래 하고 싶은 마음이 드는 힘 인 것 같다. 아마도, 지금의 면접관 중 나와 비슷한 시대와 생각을 가진 사람도 적지 않을 것이다. 프로그래밍을 즐기는 모습을 보여주는 것도 또 다른 면접 성공 전략이 아닐까 싶다.",

Material 3를 처음부터 사용하지 않고 만들겠다면 이와 동일한 코드를 직접 작성하겠다는 의미이거나, 내부 코드를 복사해서 우리만의 Theme를 만들겠다는 의미이다.\n이걸 정말 하는 것이 맞을까는 다른 이야기다. 이 모든 걸 다 직접 만들고 관리할 수 있는가?\n어차피 선택은 팀과 개인의 자유이지만 Color 정도의 Custom만으로도 충분히 좋은 코드를 만들 수 있다는 점에서는 이 방식이 좋은 선택지인지는 모르겠다.\n\nCustom Theme를 만들면서 Material 3를 포함한다면?\n필자는 이 방식으로 내부에서 사용할 Components를 재정의하여 사용하고 있고, Theme 역시 Material 3를 따르도록 설계해두었다.\n2년 전만 해도 이렇게 문서에 이 색상이 어디에서 적용되는지 알지 못하였지만 이젠 문서만 잘 보아도 이 색상을 어디에서 사용할 수 있는지 알 수 있다.\n\n이걸 기반으로 Custom Theme를 내부에 정의하여 사용하고 있는데 아래와 같은 형태다.\n\nobject SomeColor {\n\n    @Stable\n    val Color = Color(0xFF000000)\n}\n\n@Immutable\ndata class SomeColorScheme(\n    val primary: Color,\n    //... Material 3 참고 color 정의\n) {\n   // 내부 코드 참고\n}\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeTheme(\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit,\n) {\n    MaterialTheme(\n        colorScheme = SomeColor.Colors.toMaterialTheme(),\n        content = content,\n    )\n}\n\n\n마지막에 toMaterialTheme를 이용해서 한번 복사하는 과정을 거치는데 이유는 Scaffold를 보면 알 수 있는데 다음과 같이 사용하고 있기 때문에 MaterialTheme를 한번 감싸서 처리하고 있다.\n\n@Composable\nfun Scaffold(\n    containerColor: Color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.background,\n    contentColor: Color = contentColorFor(containerColor),\n    content: @Composable (PaddingValues) -> Unit\n)\n\n\n모든 Components를 내부용으로 만들 것이라면 불필요한 작업이다.\n\n답은 없다.\n두가지 방법 중 2번째 방식을 선택한 이유와 고민 포인트는 아래와 같다.\n모든 컴포넌트를 내부에서 재정의하려면 시간이 걸린다.\n    \n따로 디자인 시스템을 가지는 것은 아니니 공통화의 목적으로 컴포넌트를 만들어간다.\n신경 안 쓰고 사용하더라도 기본 Theme는 따라갈 수 있도록 만들면 좋겠다.\n    \n내부의 SomeScaffold를 사용하지 않더라도 그냥 Scaffold를 사용하여도 동일하게 나와야 한다.\n여기서 중요한 포인트 lint를 만들어 사용하면 SomeScaffold 대신 Scaffold 사용하지 않게 만들 수 있지만 이런 부분을 고려하지 않았다.\nNow In Android lint - 링크\n결국 차이라고 해봐야 Material Theme를 호출할 것인가  말 것인가의 차이다.\nMaterial Theme를 호출하였을 경우에는 dynamicColor 역시 대응이 가능하다. 하지만 보통의 회사 서비스에서는 이를 고려할 이유는 많지 않을 것 같지만 개인은 충분히 선택할 수 있는 선택지이다.\n\n\nMaterial 3 Theme를 따라보자.\nMaterial 3 Theme를 사용한다는 것은 결국 ColorCode를 적절한 위치에 위치시켜야 한다는 이야기이다. Theme를 만드는 데 있어서 Color가 어느 지점에 적절하게 사용되어야 하는지를 알아야 하는데, 위에서도 언급했지만 다행히 구글이 문서를 갱신해 주었고, 적절한 위치의 색상 사용을 알 수 있다는 것이다.\nMaterial 3 Theme - 링크에서 Components를 확인.\n적용할 수 있는 Color set은 아래와 같은데 이 값들만 36가지 종류를 가진다는 점이다. 이 값을 모두 매핑해서 사용하기엔 부담이 크다.\n여담이지만 필자는 구글이 문서를 업데이트하기 전 이미 이 작업을 하였는데, 색상이 어디에서 사용되는지 일일이 다 찾아서 사용하였는데 이와 관련한 글을 남겼었다.\n안드로이드 Compose Material 2 컬러 정보를 알아보자 - 링크\n이 중에 중요하다고 생각 드는 부분만 몇 가지 남기면?\n이 부분은 GPT를 통한 번역\nprimary: 앱의 화면과 구성 요소에서 가장 자주 표시되는 주요 색상이다.\nonPrimary: 주요 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nsecondary: 보조 색상은 제품을 강조하고 구별하는 더 많은 방법을 제공합니다. 보조 색상은 다음에 가장 적합하다\nonSecondary: 보조 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\ntertiary: 주요 색상과 보조 색상의 균형을 맞추거나 입력 필드와 같은 요소에 더 높은 주의를 끌기 위해 사용할 수 있는 제3의 색상이다.\nonTertiary: 제3의 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nbackground: 스크롤 가능한 콘텐츠 뒤에 나타나는 배경색이다.\nonBackground: 배경색 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nsurface: 카드, 시트, 메뉴와 같은 구성 요소의 표면에 영향을 미치는 표면 색상이다.\nonSurface: 표면 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nerror: 오류 색상은 텍스트 필드의 잘못된 텍스트와 같이 구성 요소의 오류를 나타내는 데 사용한다.\nonError: 오류 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\n그래도 이만큼이다. 다행히 내부적으로 머트리얼 2에서 이상하게 사용하던 코드도 제거되어서 머트리얼 3는 그나마 괜찮아졌다는 점이다.\n이 코드를 기반으로 ColorScheme을 정의하고, 이를 Theme에 주입해 주는 역할을 하면 되는데, 기본으로 생성해 준 코드에서는 아래와 같다.\n3가지 파라메터로 Dark theme 여부, dynamicColor 여부, 마지막 람다 표현으로 content 시작점을 사용할 수 있는데, 결국 MaterialTheme에 colorScheme, typography, content를 지정하여 사용하게 된다는 점이다.\n\n@Composable\nfun MyApplicationTheme(\n    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(),\n    // Dynamic color is available on Android 12+\n    dynamicColor: Boolean = true,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    val colorScheme = when {\n        dynamicColor && Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S -> {\n            val context = LocalContext.current\n            if (darkTheme) dynamicDarkColorScheme(context) else dynamicLightColorScheme(context)\n        }\n\n        darkTheme -> DarkColorScheme\n        else -> LightColorScheme\n    }\n\n    MaterialTheme(\n        colorScheme = colorScheme,\n        typography = Typography,\n        content = content\n    )\n}\n\n\n이렇게 MaterialTheme를 사용하여 지정한 코드에서 특정 컬러를 적용하고 싶다면 MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary로 호출하여 사용한다.\n이 부분이 이미 적용되어 있는 Scaffold는 아래와 같이 사용하기만 해도 기본 또는 dynamicColor에 따라 색상이 적용된다.\n\n@Composable\nfun Screen() {\n    Scaffold {\n        Box(modifier = Modifier.padding(it)) {}\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nMaterialTheme에는 어떤 걸 포함하고 있을까?\nGetStream의 코드를 보기 전에 MaterialTheme에는 어떤 걸 외부로 제공하고 있는지 살펴보고 넘어가 보자.\ncolorScheme : 현재 테마의 색상 정보를 가져올 수 있으며 MaterialTheme.colorScheme.xxx으로 불러서 사용\ntypography : 현재 테마의 폰트 정보를 가지며 MaterialTheme.typography.xxx로 불러서 사용\nshapes : 현재 테마의 shapes 정보를 가지며 MaterialTheme.shapes.xxx로 불러서 사용\n\nobject MaterialTheme {\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [ColorScheme] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val colorScheme: ColorScheme\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalColorScheme.current\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [Typography] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val typography: Typography\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalTypography.current\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [Shapes] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val shapes: Shapes\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalShapes.current\n}\n\n\n이와 같이 Material Theme를 지정해두고 사용할 수 있다. 내부적으로 SomeTheme를 사용한다면 이와 같은 클래스를 직접 만들어 활용하게 되는 것이다.\n\nGetStream Theme 알아보기 전에\nMaterial 3의 Theme는 일반적인 앱에서 활용할 수 있는 정도의 가장 기본 가이드를 제공해 준다. 반면 GetStream - 링크 APIs and SDKs to Build In-App Chat & Video & Feeds Faster.에서 사용하기 위한 SDK 용도로 확장해 사용하고 있다.\nMaterial 3의 Theme 샘플을 통해서도 확장 가능하지만 SDK에서 활용될 수 있는 점을 적절하게 이용하면 Theme 사용을 좀 더 넓은 의미로 확장해 사용할 수 있음을 알 수 있으니 Theme를 사용하는 방식을 알아보자.\n\nGetStream에서 사용하는 Theme\n기본 Theme를 내부적으로 사용할 수 있도록 SomeTheme를 만들어 사용할 수 있음을 확인하였다. 그럼 GetStream에서 제공하는 Theme는 어디까지 제공하고 있을까?\nGetStream의 코드를 보기 전에 문서를 먼저 살펴보았다.\nGetStream ChartTheme에서의 Custom 제공 정보 - 링크\n이 문서에는 생각보다 Theme를 더 넓은 의미로 활용하고 있음을 알 수 있는데, 아래와 같이 나열해 보았다.\n기본 정보\n    \nGet Stream chart 관련 기본 설정\ntest 관련 옵션 제공\n권한과 관련\n    \nAudio/Video를 활용하기 위한 권한 처리\n파일 첨부 처리를 도와주는 제어, 팩토리, 권한 관련\nTheme와 관련\n    \nTheme에 대한 상세정보, 화면별로 필요한 Theme 정보, font 정보\n기타\n    \nStream MediaRecorder\nDateFormatter\n\n코드를 살펴보자\nGetStream ChartTheme에서의 Custom 제공 정보 - 링크\n이 코드는 GetStream ChatTheme.kt - 링크의 코드 중 일부를 적은 부분인데, SDK로서의 역할을 할 수 있는 모든 부분을 담고 있다고 보아도 좋을 것 같다.\nSDK라면 지정해 준 정보를 내부에서 바꾸지 않고 그대로 활용함을 보장해야 하며\n외부에서 주입해 주는 커스텀 역시 충분히 제공하는 것이 좋다.\n라는 관점으로 보면 이 GetStream의 SDK로써는 충분히 유용하게 작성되었다는 점이다.\n문맥상 매우 길어져서 몇 가지 정보만 가져와보았으니 참고해 보면 좋을 듯하다.\n\n@Composable\npublic fun ChatTheme(\n    /* 생략 */\n    autoTranslationEnabled: Boolean = false, // 각종 옵션들\n    /* 생략 */\n    colors: StreamColors = if (isInDarkMode) StreamColors.defaultDarkColors() else StreamColors.defaultColors(), // color 정의\n    /* 생략 */\n    rippleTheme: RippleTheme = StreamRippleTheme, // Ripple 정의\n    attachmentFactories: List<AttachmentFactory> = StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories(), // 파일 첨부 정보\n    /* 생략 */\n    allowUIAutomationTest: Boolean = false, // 테스트 관련\n    dateFormatter: DateFormatter = DateFormatter.from(LocalContext.current), // 채팅에 사용할 date formatter\n    /* 생략 */\n    messagePreviewFormatter: MessagePreviewFormatter = MessagePreviewFormatter.defaultFormatter(\n        context = LocalContext.current,\n        typography = typography,\n        attachmentFactories = attachmentFactories,\n        autoTranslationEnabled = autoTranslationEnabled,\n    ),\n    /* 생략 */\n    attachmentsPickerTabFactories: List<AttachmentsPickerTabFactory> =\n        if (useDefaultSystemMediaPicker) {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactoriesWithoutStoragePermissions()\n        } else {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactories()\n        },\n    /* Theme 관련 생략 */\n    streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder = DefaultStreamMediaRecorder(LocalContext.current),\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit,\n)\n\n\n\n함수 안에도 조금 살펴보자.\nChatTheme의 코드 중에 눈에 띄는 코드는 allowUIAutomationTest 옵션을 별도로 제공한다는 점이다.\nallowUIAutomationTest - true/false를 제공함으로써 semantics를 활용한 UI Test 대응을 미리 해두었다는 점이다. 컴포즈에서 Ui test를 아직 시도하지는 않아서 자세한 내용은 문서를 참고해 보시길\nsemantics - 링크\n그 외에는 LocalXXX로 시작하는 코드들이 상당히 많이 보인다. LocalXXX 부분의 코드가 많이 보인다는 건 이 부분을 살펴보는 것이 도움이 될 수 있다는 점이다.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColors provides colors,\n        /* 생략 */\n        LocalComposerLinkPreviewEnabled provides isComposerLinkPreviewEnabled,\n) {\n    if (allowUIAutomationTest) {\n            Box(\n                modifier = Modifier.semantics { testTagsAsResourceId = allowUIAutomationTest },\n            ) {\n                content()\n            }\n        } else {\n            content()\n        }\n}\n\n\n\nGetStream의 CompositionLocalProvider 적용 부분은?\nStream에서 사용하는 CompositionLocalProvider는 모두 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다는 점이다.\n사실 Theme의 시작점이고 값의 변경은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 UI가 다시 그려짐을 보장하여도 될 것 같은데, compositionLocalOf을 사용하고 있다는 점이다.\n\nprivate val LocalColors = compositionLocalOf<StreamColors> {\n    error(\"No colors provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\nprivate val LocalDimens = compositionLocalOf<StreamDimens> {\n    error(\"No dimens provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\n\n\n그리고 또 하나 중요한 포인트는 private으로 Theme 이외에서는 이 값들을 업데이트하지 않음을 보장해 주고 있다.\n구글의 대표적인 Color 처리하는 코드는 아래와 같은데, Stream에서는 이 부분을 모두 private으로 적용한 부분을 그대로 활용할 수 있음을 보장한다.\n\nval LocalContentColor = compositionLocalOf { Color.Black }\n\n\nLocalContentColor는 언제 어디서든 값을 변경하고 업데이트할 수 있다.\n\nGetStream은 Theme에서 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용하여 값을 부르는 건 알겠는데?\nTheme의 범위를 어디까지 잡아야 할까? Stream의 코드 아랫 부분에 외부에서 사용할 수 있는 값들을 매핑하였는데 아래와 같다.\n\npublic object ChatTheme {\n    public val colors: StreamColors\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalColors.current\n\n    /* 생략 */\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current list of [StreamMediaRecorder] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    public val streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalStreamMediaRecorder.current\n}\n\n\n모든 정보는 ChatTheme.colors.xxx로 부르거나 ChatTheme.streamMediaRecorder.xxxx로 바로 활용할 수 있다는 점이다.\n그런데 Theme인데 streamMediaRecorder를 바로 불러다 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\n개인적으론 SDK라서 이를 활용하는 방식도 좋은 방법이라고 생각한다. 결국 CompositionLocalProvider를 통해 사용 범위를 명확히 지정하여 사용하고 있고, 이 값들은 초기에 지정해 준 정보를 그대로 사용하고 있음을 명시적으로 작성해두었기 때문에 특별히 문제는 없는 듯하다.\n하지만 일반적인 서비스에서 이렇게까지 하는 게 맞을까는 고민이 필요한 점이다.\n\nSomeTheme.triggerEvent.xxxx // 이렇게 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\nLocalTriggerEvent.current.xxxx // 이렇게 활용하는 것이 더 좋을까?\n\n\n\nCompositionLocalProvider를 좀 더 알아보자.\nCompositionLocalProvider을 깊이 있게 탐구하는 것은 아니지만 문서에 나와있는 내용을 좀 더 알아보고 넘어가자.\n\n결국 Theme는 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용한다.\nCompositionLocalProvider를 이용해 필요한 정보를 라이프 사이클에 맞게 불러다 활용할 수 있는데, Material 3 Theme 내부도 Stream에서의 코드와 마찬가지로 적용하고 있다.\nMaterialTheme는 크게 ColorScheme, Shapes, Typography를 주입받고, 내부에서 필요한 정보를 추가로 Provider에 셋하고 있다.\n\n@Composable\nfun MaterialTheme(\n    colorScheme: ColorScheme = MaterialTheme.colorScheme,\n    shapes: Shapes = MaterialTheme.shapes,\n    typography: Typography = MaterialTheme.typography,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    val rippleIndication = androidx.compose.material.ripple.rememberRipple()\n    val selectionColors = rememberTextSelectionColors(colorScheme)\n    CompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColorScheme provides colorScheme,\n        LocalIndication provides rippleIndication,\n        androidx.compose.material.ripple.LocalRippleTheme provides MaterialRippleTheme,\n        LocalShapes provides shapes,\n        LocalTextSelectionColors provides selectionColors,\n        LocalTypography provides typography,\n    ) {\n        ProvideTextStyle(value = typography.bodyLarge, content = content)\n    }\n}\n\n\n이 중 colorScheme은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 초기화하고 있고,\n\ninternal val LocalColorScheme = staticCompositionLocalOf { lightColorScheme() }\n\n\nselectionColors은 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다.\n\nval LocalTextSelectionColors = compositionLocalOf { DefaultTextSelectionColors }\n\n\n결국 이 둘을 잘 알면 유용하게 사용할 수 있다는 의미이니 문서를 참고해 보자.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider란?\nLocally scoped data with CompositionLocal - 링크이란 공식 문서이다.\ncompostionLocalProvider에는 2개의 초기화 방법을 제공한다.\ncompositionLocalOf : 현재 범위 내에 compositionLocal의 정보가 변경되었을 경우 해당 범위 내의 이 값을 사용하는 범위를 갱신\n    \nContentColor를 범위 내에서 color 변경한다면 이 색상을 호출하여 사용하는 곳을 추적하여 UI를 갱신\nstaticCompositionLocalOf : 이 값은 범위 내의 값을 추적하지 않고 그냥 전부 새로 그림.\n    \nContentColor를 이 값으로 활용할 경우 화면을 전부 새로 그림\n이 두 함수의 영향 범위는 매우 다름을 알 수 있다.\n이전에 작성한 Compose에서 웹뷰를 유지하는 방법에서는 staticCompositionLocalOf 활용하는 방법을 소개했었으니 참고해 보셔도 좋다.\nCompose Navigation - WebView Recomposition 해결? - 링크\nstaticCompositionLocalOf은 값이 명확하게 1회 초기화하며 이후에는 변경하지 않음을 명시할 경우 활용하는 것이 좋고, compositionLocalOf는 언제든 변경되고, 이 값이 변경되었을 경우 값을 사용한 부분도 UI 갱신이 일어나야 하는 경우 이를 활용하는 것이 좋다.\n이 내용을 깊이 있게 알고 싶다면 Jetpack Compose Internals의 4장 Compose UI, 측정 정책 (Measuring policies) 부분에서 매우 상세하게 다루고 있으니 책을 참고하여 추가 학습하시길\nJetpack Compose Internals 한국어 번역(번역 엄재웅, 류기민) - 링크\n\n마무리\n이 글은 GetStream의 후원을 받아 작성하였다. GetStream의 내부 Theme 활용을 글로 담았는데, SDK를 만든다면 이런 형태로의 Theme를 활용할 수 있구나를 파악할 수 있었다.\n거기에 결국 Theme 값을 유지하면서 상태를 보장해 주는 방식을 private으로 잘 구분하여 사용해야 하며, Theme를 통해 더 많은 값을 불러다 활용할 수 있도록 만들어주는 것 역시 가능함을 알 수 있었다.\n이런 방식에서는 사실 호불호가 생길 수 있긴 하다.\nTheme인데 왜 Theme와 관련 없는 설정 정보를 포함하는 것인가?\n초기화만 하고, Theme가 아닌 접근 방법을 제공하면 더 좋은 거 아닐까?\n이 부분은 코드 컨벤션과 관련이 있지 않을까 싶다. SomeTheme.value.xxxx를 사용하였을 때 LocalXXX.current를 기억하고 사용하는 행위를 반대로 줄일 수 있으니 말이다.\n이 글로 Theme를 구성하는 전반적인 방법이나 CompositionLocal 사용을 다 알 수 있는 것은 아니지만 Theme를 이렇게까지 활용하고 접근 제어를 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을지만 이해해도 다행이라고 생각한다.\nMaterial 3에서 사용하는 Token 방식의 Color 지정을 논하진 않았는데 이 방식은 figma와 밀접한 관련이 있다고 하니 아래 링크를 참고하시길\nm3 Design tokens - 링크\nGetStream SDK 알아보기 - 링크",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 벤처파트너로 활동하고 있는 악셀러레이터 프라이머는 일 년에 두 번의 데모데이를 개최한다. 10~15개 회사가 5분 발표를 하는데, 데모데이가 끝나면 항상 참석자들에게 듣는 말은 회사들이 모두 발표를 너무나 잘 한다는 것이다. 어쩜 5분 동안 본인들이 하는 사업에 대해서 저렇게 명확하게 설명할 수 있는지 모두 다 감탄한다. 원래 발표를 잘하는 창업가들도 많지만, 실은 프라이머 회사들의 발표는 대부분 엄청난 연습과 리허설을 통해서 다듬어지고 만들어지는 훌륭한 무대 공연이다.\n대표 전원이 나를 포함한 한국에 있는 프라이머의 액팅 파트너분들과 약 4주에 걸쳐 세 번의 데모데이 리허설을 한다. 나도 이제 거의 8년째 프라이머 데모데이 리허설을 같이 준비하고 있는데, 매번 느끼는 거지만 첫 번째 리허설 이후엔 이 발표 실력으로 과연 데모데이를 할 수나 있을지 매우 의심스럽다. 자료도 못 만들었고, 어떤 사업을 하는지도 모르겠고, 발표를 들은 후에 오히려 이 회사에 투자하고 싶은 마음이 없어질 정도로 임팩트도 없고 재미가 없다. 하지만, 또 희한한 건, 매우 직설적이고 건설적인 피드백을 열심히 제공하면 두 번째 리허설에서 훨씬 발전된 모습을 볼 수 있다. 세 번째 리허설에서는 완전히 새로운 사람이, 새로운 사업으로, 새로운 발표를 하는 느낌이 들 정도로 모두가 무대 체질로 바뀌고, 실제 데모데이에서는 대부분 완벽한 피칭을 한다. 사람의 능력엔 한계가 없고, 연습을 열심히 하면 무조건 완벽한 발표를 할 수 있다. 그 누구든.\n첫 번째 리허설 이후에 내가 모든 창업가들에게 드리는 공통 피드백이 세 가지가 있다.\n첫째는 사업에 대해 설명을 하지 말고, 기-승-전-결이 있는 매우 재미있는 스토리텔링을 하라고 한다. 두 번째는 딱딱하게 이야기하지 말고 항상 재미있는 이야기를 하라고 한다. 세 번째는 본인들이 청중이라고 생각하고, 본인들이 듣고 싶은 발표를 하라고 한다.\n결국 위 세 가지 피드백 모두 사업가/창업가가 아니라 이야기꾼이 돼서 재미있는 이야기를 청중에게 하라는 것이다. 솔직히 사업 설명은 어떻게 보면 굉장히 딱딱하고 심각하고 재미가 없는 내용이 더 많다. 우리도 하루에 평균 3~5개의 미팅을 하는데, 정말 재미없는 창업가 5명과 만나는 날은 집에 갈 때 매우 피곤하다. 어떤 분은 미팅 시작 5분 만에 그냥 미팅룸을 나가고 싶을 정도로 에너지도 없고, 딱딱하고, 듣는 사람과 양방향 커뮤니케이션을 못 한다. 보통 이런 미팅을 하면 내 이야기에 상대방이 어떻게 반응하는지 리액션도 확인하고, 상대방의 눈빛도 보면서 분위기를 조절하면서 이야기해야 하는데, 이런 건 전혀 없고 그냥 본인이 하고 싶은 이야기만 한다. 이런 분과 이야기하면 미팅 시간 내내 집중이 잘 안되고, 끝난 후에는 어떤 이야기를 했는지 잘 기억도 안 난다.\n반면에 어떤 창업가들은 타고난 이야기꾼들이다. 이런 분들은 제품이 없어도, 매출이 없어도, 아직 뭐 하나 제대로 못 만들었어도, 1시간이라는 미팅 시간이 5분 같이 느껴질 정도로 스토리텔링을 완벽하게 한다. 창업가 본인은 어떤 사람인지, 왜 이 사업을 하는지, 마치 잘 짜인 단편소설 같은 이야기를 해준다. 목소리의 톤앤매너도 너무 좋고, 이런 이야기꾼들이 가장 잘하는 건, 본인의 말에 상대방이 어떻게 반응하는지, 그리고 어떤 리액션을 보이는지 잘 관찰한 후에 계속 대화를 이어 나간다. 표정, 제스처, 아이 컨택트, 이 모든 걸 자연스럽게 한다. 이런 창업가를 하루에 한 분만 만나도 그날 집에 갈 땐 기분이 좋다.\n물론, 모든 이야기꾼이 좋은 창업가나 사업가는 아니다. 하지만, 내 경험에 의하면 이 반대는 사실이다. 내가 아는 모든 좋은 창업가와 사업가는 괜찮은 이야기꾼이다. 이 세상에 재미있는 이야기를 싫어하는 사람은 없고, 재미있는 이야기로 투자자의 관심을 끌 수 있다면, 더 깊은 대화를 나눌 확률이 높아진다.\n난 원래 재미없는 사람인데 어떡하냐고 생각을 하고 있다면, 이 또한 연습하면 된다. 연습하고, 연습하고, 또 연습하면 좋은 이야기꾼이 될 수 있다.",

모셔야 한다는 목표로 한 분 한 분 컨택하던 중, 채용팀은 이런 생각을 하게 됐는데요. ‘업계에 있는 유능한 개발자는 모두 토스에 지원하게 해야 하는 거 아냐?’\n그러려면 이미 토스에 지원해본 사람이 아닌, ‘토스에 한 번도 지원한 적 없는 사람’도 토스에 관심을 가지게 만들어야겠다는 생각으로 이어졌어요. 토스 외부에 계신 분들을 대상으로 설문조사를 진행했고, 그분들이 이직할 때 우선순위로 고려하는 것이 무엇인지 알아내고자 했습니다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}공통적으로 나왔던 답변은 바로 ‘우수한 동료’. 이걸 힌트 삼아 토스가 가진 우수한 기술력과 팀원들의 뛰어난 역량을 더 적극적으로 외부에 알리기로 했어요.\n토스 외에도 토스뱅크, 토스증권, 토스페이먼츠 등 여러 계열사가 생겨날 때라, 다양하고 깊이 있는 기술 사례를 세션으로 풀어낼 수 있었습니다. 첫 SLASH 21은 총 19개의 세션으로 진행됐고, 토스 개발자들이 기술을 대하는 태도를 담은 오프닝 키노트부터 서버 인프라 모니터링 경험, SRE 사례 소개, 데이터의 흐름과 활용법, 프론트엔드 클린 코드까지 다양한 테크 영역의 이야기를 다뤘어요.\n당시 팬데믹으로 오프라인 행사 진행이 어려워 컨퍼런스는 온라인으로 진행되었는데도, 참가자분들이 보내주신 관심과 평가는 감동적이었습니다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px

잡았습니다. 2021, 2022, 2023년에는 온라인에서 2024년에는 오프라인에서 진행된 SLASH가 어떤 여정을 거쳐 발전해 왔는지 보여드리려 해요.\n온라인으로 진행되어 온 SLASH, 3년의 변천사\n매년 진행하는 컨퍼런스이지만, 사람들에게 늘 새롭게 기억될 수 있길 바라는 마음으로 기획해 왔습니다. 그 해에 꼭 담아내고 싶은 메시지를 뽑아내고, 이전에 본 적 없던 신선한 키 비주얼과 컨셉을 활용했어요. 전통적인 컨퍼런스 이미지에서 벗어나 ‘토스만의 이미지’를 보여주고자 했던 노력의 일환을 연도 별로 담아봤어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0

있을까?’\n‘토스 기술의 기반을 이루는 것은 어떤 것들일까?’\n토스에서 사용하는 기술 자체가 특별한 것은 아니지만, 토스팀 엔지니어들이 문제를 해결해 나가는 특별한 방식을 세션에 녹여냈는데요. 그 방식이 특별한 이유는, 사용자들이 가장 원하는 서비스, 해결하고 싶은 문제 자체를 실현하는 데에 토스 엔지니어링 팀의 기술과 에너지를 집중해왔기 때문입니다.\n오직 사용자 중심으로 진화해온 토스의 기술 혁신. 사용자 입장에서 이해하기 쉽고 직관적인 서비스를 만드는 것, 그와 동시에 기존의 금융 서비스를 이용하며 느끼는 불편과 의문을 해소시키는 일에는 항상 기술적인 도전이 뒤따랐습니다. 더 나아가 완전히 새롭고 혁신적인 경험을 줄 수 있는 방법을 모색하고 기술적으로 구현하는 과정도 있었기에, 이 이야기를 더 많은 분들과 나누고 싶었습니다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

21 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\nSLASH 21을 준비하는 과정을 돌이켜 보면, 컨퍼런스 이름을 정하는 과정에서부터 토스만의 색깔을 녹여내기 위해 많은 논의를 거쳤습니다. 컨퍼런스 이름인 SLASH는 개발할 때 명령어 앞에 사용되는 ‘/’ 기호를 말합니다. 토스 사용자들의 삶에 유의미한 변화를 만들어내기 위해, 관습을 깨고 기술 혁신의 획을 그었다는 의미로 ‘긋다'라는 중의적 의미도 담아냈어요. 더 나아가 컨퍼런스 전체를 관통하는 키 그래픽을 만드는 데도 공을 들였는데요. ‘/’ 기호를 3D 그래픽을 활용해 입체적으로 구현하고, 다각도로 움직이는 모습을 구현해 냈습니다.\n.css-oni540{position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;}\n.css-122y91a{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;}\n\n한발 더 나아가 개발 생태계 선순환에 기여하기 위한 깜짝 이벤트도 준비했었는데요. 참가자들이 컨퍼런스에 사전 신청을 하면 개발 커뮤니티의 성장과 생태계 발전에 기여할 수 있는 이벤트를 기획했어요. 총 1억 원이 넘는 금액이 모였고, 후원금은 토스에서 전액 지원하는 방식으로 개발자 컨퍼런스를 후원하였습니다.\n\n🚩 SLASH 22 - No User, No Technology\n\n2021년에 ‘토스가 첫 개발자 컨퍼런스를 열었다’는 메시지는 잘 전달되었는데, 우리가 꼭 알리고 싶었던 슬로건 ‘No User, No Technology’는 잘 전달이 안 됐다는 것을 설문조사를 통해 확인할 수 있었어요.\n늘 사용자 관점에서 기술을 고민하고 고객 중심으로 서비스를 만들어내는 토스인 만큼, 이 슬로건을 더 잘 알릴 필요가 있다는 생각으로 2022년에도 동일한 슬로건을 활용했습니다. 2022년에는 슬로건을 전면에 내세워 사람들에게 잘 인지시키도록 해보자는 목표로 컨퍼런스가 기획되었어요.\n2021년보다 2022년에 더 많이 신경썼던 것은 세션의 퀄리티인데요. 참가자분들이 따로 시간을 내어 참석하시는 만큼 세션에서 얻어가는 것이 많았으면 하는 바람이었습니다. 각 엔지니어링 챕터 리드, 테크니컬 라이터, 커뮤니케이션 팀까지 3단계 검수 프로세스를 거쳤고, 연사분들이 촬영에 들어가기 전까지 부족한 부분을 채울 수 있도록 리허설도 진행했습니다. 스피치 코치도 따로 모셔서 어디를 어떻게 강조해야 하는지, 어디에서 쉬어가야 하는지 등 세세한 피드백을 제공하며 세션 퀄리티를 높였고요.\n\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper

22 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\n키 비주얼 사이드에서는 ‘개발자 오브제'를 3D 에셋으로 만드는 작업이 진행됐어요. 개발자 컨퍼런스인 만큼 개발자분들에게 친숙한 오브제를 활용해 컨퍼런스도 친숙하게 느껴지게 만드는 것이 목표였습니다. 커피, 헤드셋, 키보드 등 개발자분들에게 친숙한 것들을 선정해 둥둥 떠다니는 3D 에셋으로 만들었죠. 세션 리스트에 하나하나 넣어서 토스다운 이미지를 전달하고자 했습니다.\n\n\n\n🚩 SLASH 23 - The Hidden Side of Technology\n\n2022년에는 세션 퀄리티를 높이는 방법을 시도했으니 2023년에는 키 비주얼, 컨셉 또한 더 세련되게 풀어내고자 했어요. 이전과 다르게 완전히 새로운 슬로건을 세우고, 토스에서도 이전에 해본 적 없던 방식의 크리에이티브한 키 비주얼을 활용했습니다. 여러모로 새로운 도전이 돋보인 SLASH였던 거죠.\n슬로건은 ‘The Hidden Side of Technology’로, 쉽고 간편한 토스 서비스 이면에 정말 꼼꼼하고 치열한 논의 끝에 채택된 기술이 흐르고 있다는 것을 보여주기 위해 선정됐습니다. ‘토스, 너무 편하고 쉬운데 보안은 약한 거 아냐?’라는 이미지를 깨기 위함이었죠. \n전체적인 세션 내용에서 편하고 쉽고 빠른 서비스를 제공하면서도 보안을 지키기 위해 토스 엔지니어링 조직의 치열한 노력이 수반된다는 것을 보여주면서, 토스 전반의 브랜딩에도 기여하기 위한 목표를 세웠어요.\n\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper

23 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\n키 비주얼은 그동안 토스에서 많이 활용해왔던 3D 에셋을 벗어나, 2D 애니메이션을 기획해보는 방향을 선택했습니다. ‘릭 앤 모티’ 2D 애니메이션 컨셉으로 5명의 개발자 캐릭터를 만들어 오프닝 필름을 만들었어요. ‘토스는 개발자 컨퍼런스도 다르다'는 이미지를 주기 위함이었습니다.\n\n\n\n실제로 설문을 통해서도 “개발자로서 자부심 느껴지는 애니메이션”, “토스가 브랜딩에 대해 많이 고민하는 모습이 보인다. 작년보다 훨씬 친근하게 각인됐다\", “감탄하면서 봤다. 진짜 작정했구나 싶어 소름 돋았다\" 등 오프닝 필름에 대한 긍정적인 의견을 많이 받아볼 수 있었고요.\n드디어 오프라인에서 진행된 SLASH 24\n\n왜 화면 밖으로 향했냐면\n2021년 SLASH를 처음 기획할 때부터 ‘컨퍼런스는 오프라인'이라는 생각이 있었어요. 하지만 당시에는 팬데믹 시기였기 때문에, 선택의 여지 없이 온라인으로만 진행해야 했죠.\n그런데 펜데믹 이전의 ‘컨퍼런스'를 떠올리면 직접 대면해 명함 주고받으며 네트워킹도 하고, 같은 시간 한 장소에 다같이 모여 행사의 열기를 느끼는 것이 일반적이었던 거예요. 제약이 없어진 만큼 이번 컨퍼런스는 오프라인에서 진행하지 않을 이유가 없었습니다.\n무엇보다 SLASH 컨퍼런스의 목표는 ‘채용’이었기 때문인데요. 컨퍼런스 참가자분들이 채용으로 이어지려면 온라인보다는 오프라인이 효과적일 거라 기대했습니다. 직접 만나 이야기 나눠보시면, 토스팀에 없던 관심을 충분히 이끌어낼 수 있다는 자신감이 있었어요.\n\nNo Limit: 풀지 못할 문제는 없다\n이번 SLASH 24 슬로건은 ‘한계 없는 도전, 그리고 실패해도 일어나는 끈기'라는 심상을 뽑아내는 데에 집중한 문장인데요. 그 기저에는 토스의 개발 문화가 큰 몫을 했습니다. 토스의 모든 엔지니어들이 한계없이 도전하고 있다는 것을 많은 곳에서 체감할 수 있었기 때문이죠.\n메시지 개발 단계에서는 크게 3가지 포인트에서 중점적으로 고민했습니다.\n1) 기술 관련 이야기 외에도 토스만이 할 수 있는 이야기가 무엇인가?\n2) 참가자에게도 울림을 줄 수 있는 메시지는 무엇인가?\n3) 오프라인에서 더 임팩트 있게 전달될 수 있는 메시지는 무엇인가?\n이 3가지를 모두 아우를 수 있는 교집합을 찾기 위해, 그간 SLASH에 참여해주셨던 분들의 피드백을 샅샅이 뒤졌어요. ‘기술에 대해 이야기하는 컨퍼런스이지만 틀을 깨는 도전과 시도를 많이 한다', ‘시행착오를 여러 번 겪더라도 될 때까지 하는 팀이라는 것을 느꼈다'는 말에서 단서를 찾을 수 있었습니다.\n\n끝까지 멈추지 않고 한계없이 도전하는 토스의 개발 문화를 표현하기 위해 “No Limit: 풀지 못할 문제는 없다\"는 슬로건을 뽑아낼 수 있었고, 더 나아가 ‘클라이밍'이라는 키 컨셉까지 선정할 수 있었어요. 한계를 규정하지 않고 늘 다음 ‘문제'를 찾아다니고, 처음부터 성공하지 못하더라도 수없이 많은 도전 끝에 결국은 정상을 찍는 클라이밍의 모습이 토스의 개발 문화와도 많이 닮아있었거든요. 재밌게도 클라이밍에서도 이 과정을 개발처럼 ‘문제'라고 부릅니다. ‘개발'이라는 단어를 직접적으로 사용하지 않으면서도 클라이밍과 개발 사이의 교집합을 보다 명확히 짚어주고자 했어요.\n브랜딩과 디테일에 힘쓴 결과\n처음에 키 컨셉 ‘클라이밍'을 잡고 실내 클라이밍에 집중해 키 비주얼을 구현하고 있었는데, 진행하다 보니 시각적 한계가 명확하게 보였습니다. 실내 클라이밍장은 일반적으로 배경 벽과 홀더로 구성되어 있으며, 다양한 크기의 홀더가 일정한 간격으로 배치되어 있는데요. 이러한 요소들을 활용해 SLASH와 연관된 시각적 장치를 만드는 것은 가능하지만, ‘No Limit’이라는 타이틀의 의미를 퇴색시키는 것 같았어요.\n고민을 이어가던 중, 차라리 ‘인간이 자연에 도전하는 야외 클라이밍 컨셉이 더 좋지 않을까?’ 하는 생각이 들었습니다. 높은 암벽을 맨손으로 오르는 야외 클라이밍 영상들을 보니, 불가능할 것 같은 한계에 도전하는 토스 개발자들의 정신과 잘 어우러진다는 확신이 생겼어요.\n그렇게 실내 클라이밍장의 배경 벽보다는 야외 클라이밍이 펼쳐지는 자연 컨셉으로, 일반적인 바위산보다는 슬래시(/) 형태의 비현실적인 형태의 산을 오르는 클라이머를 통해 불가능할 것 같은 한계에 도전하는 토스 개발자들의 정신을 담고자 했습니다.\n\n\n\n오프닝 필름은 SLASH를 처음 접하게 되는 첫인상인 만큼, 사람들에게 강렬하게 남아야 한다고 생각했어요. 후킹되는 비주얼을 만드는 동시에 클라이밍 컨셉과 No Limit 타이틀 심상까지 잘 전달할 수 있어야 하기 때문에 어려운 과제였고요. 담고 싶은 이야기는 너무 많았지만 임팩트와 집중도가 떨어질 것 같아서, 클라이밍 장면에서 슬래시(/)로 이어지는 키 비주얼을 통해 많은 내러티브를 생략하고, 최종 장면에서는 ‘No Limit’ 타이틀을 임팩트있게 담아내기로 했어요.\n짧은 영상으로 큰 임팩트를 주기 위해 초 단위로 디테일하게 고민해 나온 결과물인데, 유튜브 댓글에 ‘행사 영상 하나에도 토스 클래스가 느껴진다', ‘역시 토스는 토스다. 이 영화 언제 개봉해요?’ ‘와, 나 개발자 아닌데 왜 이렇게 마음이 웅장해지는지' 반응들을 보니 의도한 심상이 잘 전달될 것 같았어요.\n오프라인 행사 현장이었던 코엑스의 넓은 공간에도 키 비주얼을 일관성 있게 담아냈어요. 오프닝 필름에서의 경험을 확장하여 심상을 전달하는 한편, 야외 클라이밍이라는 컨셉에서 오는 개방감 있는 느낌으로 채웠습니다.\n코엑스 하면 떠오르는 커다란 ㄷ자형 미디어에는 키 비주얼 바위가 임팩트 있는 사이즈로 굉장히 크게 들어가게 했어요. 영상에서 봤던 말도 안 되는 사이즈의 바위 규모감을 현장에서도 전달하기 위해서였습니다.\n\n웹사이트에서도 차별화된 디자인 톤을 담아내기 위해 노력했는데요. 카드 UI를 각진 돌 형태로 변경하거나, 스크롤 바를 암벽 등반하는 모습으로 커스터마이징하는 등의 장치를 추가해 클라이밍 컨셉을 더욱 강조했어요. 기존에 토스에서 선보이던 것과 다른 톤앤매너로 개발자들에게도 신선한 느낌을 주고자 했고, 업계 트렌드를 주도하는 도전적인 이미지를 전달하고자 했습니다.\n토스에서 진행하는 첫 오프라인 개발 컨퍼런스인 만큼, 키 비주얼과 컨셉이 어느 한 매체에서 툭 튀는 것이 아니라 오프닝 필름, 웹사이트, 오프라인 현장까지 일관된 경험을 하도록 자연스럽게 설계하는 것이 가장 중요했습니다. 그래서 초반 얼개를 짜고 컨셉을 잡는 데에 많은 공을 들였던 거고요.\n행사 이후 진행한 설문조사에서 “온/오프라인으로 접한 SLASH 24 메시지와 비주얼이 컨퍼런스 이미지에 어떤 영향을 주었는지\" 물었는데요. 약 63%의 응답자가 ‘컨퍼런스에 대한 흥미가 높아졌다'고 답변했습니다. 뒤이어 58%의 응답자가 ‘컨퍼런스에 꼭 참여하고 싶어졌다', 33%의 응답자가 ‘영감을 받았다'는 답변을 기록했고요.\n2023년에 많은 사랑을 받았던 2D 애니메이션 같은 컨셉으로 가는 것도 고민했지만, 같은 걸 반복할 수 없다 생각한 보람이 있는 설문 결과였습니다. 어떤 분야든 늘 새롭게 도전하는 토스를 좋아해주시는 분들이 많다는 것을 알고 있으니, 이왕이면 새로운 컨셉으로 새로운 심상을 전달하고 싶었거든요.\n무엇보다 SLASH 24에 참여하는 분들이 기술적인 지식과 경험을 얻어가는 것 이상으로, ‘토스'를 온전히 경험하시길 바랐습니다. 그동안 토스를 모바일과 PC로만 만나셨을 개발자분들이 토스를 실제로 만나는 기회이기 때문에, 완성도 높고 오래도록 기억에 남을 수 있는 경험을 선물하고 싶었고요.\n그 어느 컨퍼런스보다 다채로운 경험을 선사하기 위해\n오프라인 행사 특성 상 단순히 세션을 듣는 것 그 이상의 경험이 필요하다 생각했기 때문에, 다양한 프로그램을 준비했습니다.\n세션과 연계해 더 깊이있는 경험을 제공하기 위해 세션 관련 질의응답 및 기술 관련 고민을 나눌 수 있는 소규모 네트워킹 프로그램을 구성했고, 커리어 고민과 연계해 맞춤 채용 상담을 받을 수 있는 리크루팅존도 운영했어요.\n\n가장 반응이 좋았던 것은 이벤트 월에서 경험할 수 있었던 러닝&인사이트 존인데요. 연사들의 모든 발표 자료를 바인딩해서 가져갈 수 있도록 한 체험 공간이었어요. 개별 카드에는 연사 정보 및 각 세션의 내용이 요약되어 있고, 발표 자료를 pdf로 다운로드받을 수 있는 QR코드도 넣어두었어요. 생각보다 더 많은 분들이 이 존을 경험하기 위해 긴 줄을 서서 기다리는 것을 보고, 컨퍼런스에 오는 분들의 열의가 엄청나다는 생각이 들었습니다.\n\n개발 지식 관련 세션 이외에도 조직 관리, 리더십, 일 잘하는 방법 등을 다룬 스페셜 세션이 진행됐는데요. 다양한 토픽 중 ‘Dear Future CTO’ 세션이 인상 깊었다는 피드백이 많았습니다. 이 세션은 토스뱅크와 토스증권의 Head of Technology 두 분이 참여하셨는데요. 앞으로 리더십 포지션을 꿈꾸는 분들에게 하고 싶은 말을 담아냈습니다.\n세션 하나하나에도 브랜드 가치를 녹여내기 위해 많은 고민을 했었는데요. 특히 이 세션을 기획할 때 가장 중요하게 여겼던 것은, ‘CTO를 커리어패스로서 소개하지 않기'였어요. 이 세션에서는 ‘CTO가 되려면 경력이 얼마나 필요한지' 이야기하지 않았습니다. 오히려 토스의 CTO는 어떤 리더십을 가지고 있고, 어떤 비전을 꿈꾸는지 나누는 것에 집중했어요. 왜냐하면 토스가 일하는 방식을 간접적으로 녹여내 토스팀 개발 문화를 좀더 과감하게 보여주고 싶었기 때문입니다.\n오프라인 컨퍼런스라는 장점을 십분 활용해, 스피커와 청중이 서로 공감하며 이야기를 나눌 수 있는 아고라 형태로 기획했는데 다른 세션과 달리 일방적으로 정보 전달하는 것을 넘어 서로 궁금한 점을 물어보고 답변받을 수 있도록 구성한 덕분에 많은 분들의 기억에 남을 수 있었던 것 같습니다.\n\n\n\n공간적인 측면에서는 평일에 진행되는 행사임을 감안해, 업무를 보셔야 하는 참가자분들의 편의를 고려한 ‘워크스테이션' 존도 마련했어요. 노트북, 스마트폰 등 기기를 충전하거나 잠시 앉아 일을 해야 하는 상황을 미리 배려한 것이었는데요. 시디즈라는 브랜드와의 협업을 통해, 개발자분들 타겟으로 만들어진 퍼포먼스공학 의자를 비치해두었고, 기대 이상으로 많은 분들이 이용해주셨습니다.\n굿즈에서도 일관된 브랜딩 경험을 할 수 있도록 키 비주얼의 여러 요소들을 적절히 적용했어요. 가방에는 오프닝 필름의 인트로에 코딩 텍스트를 이스터 에그로 담았었는데 가방 디자인에 활용했고요. No Limit 타이틀을 메인 오브젝트로 삼아 키링도 제작했어요. 카라비너, 와이어 키링 등 소재도 함께 사용해 클라이밍 컨셉을 제대로 보여주고자 했습니다.\n\nSLASH가 가져온 변화\n4년에 걸쳐 SLASH가 만들어온 브랜드의 크기가 새삼 어마어마하게 느껴집니다. 2021년에는 토스의 개발 문화를 잘 알리기 위해 온라인으로 컨퍼런스를 열었고, 2022년에는 모든 세션의 퀄리티를 업그레이드했고, 2023년에는 세련된 키 비주얼과 컨셉으로 개발자들의 시선을 사로잡았고, 2024년에는 화면 밖으로 나가 1,500여 명의 참가자들과 함께 현장에서 호흡하며 토스의 개발 문화를 널리 전파했죠.\n“토스 SLASH 올해는 언제 해요?” 라는 질문이 꽤 오는 걸 보면, 이제 매년 기다려지는 개발자 컨퍼런스로 자리매김했다 해도 과언이 아닙니다.\n실제로 SLASH는 토스팀에도 큰 영향을 미쳤습니다. 현재 토스팀에 있는 개발자의 60% 이상이 지원할 때 SLASH의 영향을 받았다고 해요. 좋은 동료분들을 모셔오는 데에 제 역할을 톡톡히 해내고 있는 셈이죠. 매년 컨퍼런스를 준비해온 길드는 해를 거듭할 때마다 러닝과 인사이트를 쌓아나가고 있고요.\n다음 SLASH는 또 어떤 모습으로 찾아올지 궁금해지는 가을입니다. 첫 오프라인 컨퍼런스를 성공적으로 치뤄낸 토스팀은, 언제나처럼 더 나은 컨퍼런스 경험을 제공하기 위해 치열하게 고민할 계획입니다. 앞으로도 ‘토스가 토스했다'는 피드백이 유효하기를 기대해주세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWords 차지현 조유현 정다솔 김태성 권영찬 Photo 김세희 Cover & Graphic 이서영",
