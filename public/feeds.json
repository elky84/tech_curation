        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2024.05.24 release as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout May. This month’s update also includes individual pages for each package on the vcpkg website as well as several new documentation articles.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,434 total ports available in the vcpkg public registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n11 new ports were added to the open-source registry.\n387 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n20 contributors submitted PRs, issues, or participated in discussions in the main repo.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,100 forks and 21,900 stars on GitHub.\nThere was no update this month to the vcpkg tool binary itself. However, we have made an important update to our website, vcpkg.io.\n \nIndividual pages for each port\nEach one of the 2,434 ports available in the vcpkg open-source registry now has a dedicated page on vcpkg.io with more information about them. You can access these pages by using the search features accessible under Packages at the top right of the site. Below are some example screenshots of the openssl port. You can also review it for yourself at vcpkg.io/en/package/openssl.\n\nEach port page contains the following elements:\nThe name of the port.\nThe most recently available version.\nA description of the port.\nThe license for the port.\nThe last updated date for the port.\nThe “Supports” expression for the port which lists which triplets are explicitly supported or not supported. If blank, all triplets are assumed to be supported.\nA link to documentation for the port, if available.\nA link to the homepage for the port, if available.\nInstallation instructions for both classic and manifest mode.\nFour tabs with additional information:\n\nDependencies: Lists the port’s dependencies.\nFeatures: Lists the port’s optional features.\nVersions: Lists all available versions of the port in the vcpkg registry.\nPort Content: Lists all the files that comprise the port.\nA view of the Features tab for openssl:\n\nA view of the Versions tab for openssl:\n\nA view of the Port Content tab for openssl:\n\nWe hope these new pages make it easier for anyone interested in vcpkg to learn more about libraries they can install out of the box from the open-source registry. And we would love your feedback on how we can make our website better!\n \nDocumentation changes\nSeparated previous binary caching article into separate concepts and reference articles. The concepts article is a good place to start if you are new to binary caching or want to learn best practices. The reference article lists all the interaction points of the feature and is useful when you are actually implementing or updating binary caching support for your libraries.\nAdded Port policies reference article. Documents various ways to change and customize vcpkg’s behavior, such as post-build checks, and how certain ports are categorized based on their intended functionality.\nAdded Continuous integration concepts article. Provides guidance for using vcpkg in continuous integration environments.\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\n \nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,298\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,208\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,184\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,216\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,873\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,267\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,233\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,256\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,144\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,067\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,565\n\n\nx64-android\n1,620\n\n\narm64-android\n1,594\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\n \nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "pubDate": "Thu, 30 May 2024 19:15:25 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code, while its outward functionality remains unchanged. By refactoring, you can simplify complex code structures, reduce code redundancy, and enhance code reusability. Visual Studio offers many tools to help refactor your C++ code. This article will delve into these tools, using the bullet3 open-source code as an example. \nRename \nThe renaming tool is useful when changing a symbol name that appears in multiple locations within your code. Manual renaming can lead to errors if one or more instances of your function or variable are overlooked. However, the renaming tool ensures all instances are renamed accurately and seamlessly. \nConsider the ExampleEntryPhysicsServer struct in the ‘InProcessExampleBrowser.cpp’ file. Suppose we want to rename the m_menuLevel variable to m_menuHierarchyLevel to make it more descriptive for clarity. Visual Studio’s Rename refactoring tool can accomplish this, by right-clicking on the variable name, selecting Rename, and then typing the new name. Visual Studio will automatically update all instances of m_menuLevel to m_menuHierarchyLevel, eliminating the need for manual renaming.\n\nAI-Powered Rename Suggestions \nGitHub Copilot‘ s AI-Powered Rename Suggestions is a new feature in Visual Studio 2022 that generates dynamic name suggestions for any C++ identifier, aiding in achieving a balance between descriptiveness and brevity. This allows you to dedicate your efforts towards evaluating the proposed names, rather than generating new ones. \n You can make this feature visible by selecting “Enable rename suggestions” Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot chat > Preview features.  \nLet’s use the AI-Powered Rename Suggestions to rename m_name to a more descriptive one. First, right-click on the variable and choose Rename. In the Rename window that appears, click on the new sparkle icon to generate name suggestions. Copilot chat will then offer suggestions based on how the identifier is used and the naming rules in your code. Let’s select m_entryName, and then preview and apply the change. \nmake it\nChange Signature  \nThe Change Signature feature helps you modify a function’s parameters in a safe and efficient manner. When we want to provide a new parameter for a description to the first instance of ExampleEntryPhysicsServer constructor, we will right-click on its name and select the ‘Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option or use the Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut. Select the Change Signature option to open a new window. Here, you can add, remove, or reorder parameters. We’ll add a constant string pointer m_description, by typing the type and name. Visual Studio will automatically update all function calls accordingly. \n\nSimilar to renaming, changing functions one by one can result in errors and this tool can do it automatically to eliminate those errors.\nExtract Function \nExtract Function is a great way to break down complex functions into smaller, more manageable parts, and allows for potential reusability of a block of code if similar functionality is needed elsewhere in the program. In this code, let’s extract the block of code from the ExampleBrowserThreadFunc function that calculates and updates deltaTimeInSeconds and then decides whether to update graphics or reset the clock based on deltaTimeInSeconds. This block of code is a logical unit that performs a specific task, so it makes sense to extract it into a separate function.  \nTo do so, select the block of code that we want to extract, then right-click on the editor, then select the ‘Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option. This will display the Extract Function tool. Choosing that option will open a new window that will allow you to choose a new function name and placement. A new function will be set up at the chosen location, with a matching prototype in the header file. The initial code will be revised to invoke this function. \n\nThis helps to avoid code duplication and makes your code easier to read and maintain.  \nImplement Pure Virtuals \nWhen dealing with a base class that has pure virtual functions, Visual Studio can help implement these functions in all derived classes. In this source code, all pure virtual functions of the base class are implemented. However, for the sake of an example, I modified the CommonRigidBodyBase struct to include a pure virtual function virtual void somePureVirtualFunction () = 0;. Now we will use Implement Pure Virtuals to provide an implementation for somePureVirtualFunction () in the BasicExample class. \nFirst, right-click on the derived class and select the ‘Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option from the context menu or use Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut. Then select the Implement all Pure Virtuals for class BasicExample option, and the pure virtual method will be added automatically. \n\nThis saves more time especially if you have a lot of virtual functions, because instead of doing it one by one, this tool will implement all pure virtual functions automatically. \nCreate Declaration / Definition \nThis feature enables you to easily generate a function’s declaration or definition. Let’s consider adding a new function, printExampleDetails that takes a pointer to an ExampleEntriesPhysicsServer object and prints the details of all the examples registered in the server. We can use Create Declaration/Definition tool, to seamlessly declare it.  \nSelect the block of code, then right-click on the editor, then select the ’Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option from the context menu or use Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut. This will display the Create Declaration/Definition option, which will automatically create the declaration for that function.  \n\nMove Definition Location \nNow that we have seen how to declare a function, we can move a function’s definition to its corresponding header file. In the ‘ExampleEntries.cpp’ file, we have a ExampleEntriesAll::registerExampleEntry function. For code reusability, let’s move the definition of this function to a header file. \nTo move function location, right-click on the function, then select the ‘Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option from the context menu or use Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut. Then choose the Move Definition Location option, to move the function to the corresponding header file. \n\nThis feature can be very useful when you want to organize your code by moving function definitions to appropriate header files without having to do it manually. \nConvert to Raw String Literal \nNext, let’s look at a string with special characters or escape sequences. For example, if you have a string Torus (Shape Match) and you want to add quotation marks around Torus, you would normally need to use escape characters, like this: \\\"Torus\\\" (Shape Match). However, this can make the string harder to read, especially if there are many special characters. To solve this problem, we can convert them to raw string literals by prefixing the string with R and enclosing it in parentheses, like this: R\"(\"Torus\" (Shape Match))\". This tells the program to interpret all characters within the parentheses as literal characters, not special characters.\nTo convert to Raw String Literal, right-click on the string and then select the ‘Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option from the context menu or use the Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut. Then, selecting the ‘Convert to Raw String Literal’ option will complete the process. Visual Studio will preserve the exact content of the string.\n\nConvert Macros to Constexpr \nMacros can be challenging to read and debug but converting them to constexpr functions can enhance code readability and maintainability. This feature identifies macros that can be converted to constexpr, and then offers a quick way to convert them to modern C++ constexpr expressions. \nTo convert #define ARRAY_SIZE_Y 5 to a constexpr, you can hover over the suggestion indicator (…) below the macro or select the macro and then chose ’Quick Actions and Refactorings…’ option from the context menu (Ctrl+. keyboard shortcut). This will display the Convert Macros to Constexpr option, which will complete the conversion to constexpr auto ARRAY_SIZE_Y = 5;. \n\nThis feature can process constants and basic expressions contained in function-like macros. Due to performance optimization, some macros may not display the ‘…’ indicator, however, the conversion option remains readily available in the lightbulb menu. To configure Convert Macros to Constexpr, navigate Tools > Options > Text Editor > C/C++ > View > Macros Convertible to constexpr. \nConvert Macros to Constexpr is a feature within our fix-it capabilities. In our forthcoming blog post, we will delve into additional fix-it features that are currently available in Visual Studio.\nGitHub Copilot for Refactoring  \nGitHub Copilot, an AI-powered coding assistant, can help C++ developers refactor their code. It offers a streamlined process for refactoring, making it an efficient and effective tool for code optimization. \nTo utilize GitHub Copilot for refactoring, begin by identifying the segment of code you wish to refactor. This could be a function, a class, or even a single line of code. Once identified, right-click on the selected code and request assistance from Copilot to refactor it. The command can be tailored to your specific needs. Upon generating a suggestion for the refactoring, it’s crucial to review this carefully. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure it aligns with your coding standards and project requirements. Once you’re satisfied with the proposed refactoring, proceed to implement the changes in your code. \nFor instance, suppose you’re working with a complex function in C++, like btCreateInProcessExampleBrowser in ‘InProcessExampleBrowser.cpp’. To simplify it, you’d highlight the function and ask GitHub Copilot for a simplification. Copilot suggested using auto for type inference, nullptr instead of 0, static_cast for safer type conversion, and limiting the scope of loop variables. These changes improve readability, safety, and maintainability. You can select preview, to compare and review the differences between the original and proposed code. If you’re satisfied with the changes, you can accept them to incorporate the refactored code directly into your existing codebase.\n\nSend us your feedback \nWe encourage you to continue exploring the C++ refactoring features in Visual Studio.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The May release of CMake Tools in VS Code is now available. With this release, we have some new updates to the extension to improve CMake integrations with the extension’s support.\nSome major highlights include improvements to the CMake: Quick Start command and support for CMake presets v7 and v8.\nTo view the full list of updates with this release, please look at our CHANGELOG. This release features 2 contributions from our open-source community (@OrkunTokdemir and @hippo91). We greatly appreciate your continued support!\nCMake: Quick Start Updates\nThe CMake: Quick Start command is a command that assists users in building an existing simple project with CMake when they do not have a CMakeLists.txt file in their project. It generates a CMakeLists.txt file for you, so that you can add CMake support to your project. \n\nThis command has been updated to integrate better with your pre-existing project needs by:\nAllowing you to add pre-existing .cpp files as targets in the generated CMakeLists.txt file\nAllowing you to dynamically add other support to your CMakeLists.txt file, such as CPack (packaging) and CTest (testing)\nAdding support to generate a CMakePresets.json file for your project based on custom configurations or pre-existing compilers on your machine.\nNow, when you are starting up a CMake project and need to onboard .cpp files to CMake, you are set up for ultimate levels of customizability and success.\nHow it works\nWhen you invoke CMake: Quick Start via the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), you’ll be prompted to name your project. From there, we’ve enhanced our experience to dynamically generate a CMakeLists.txt file and CMakePresets.json file.\nFor the CMakeLists.txt file, you will now have additional options to add CPack and CTest support to your CMakeLists.txt file.\nAdditionally, you can select to add any pre-existing .cpp files in your projects as CMake targets in your CMakeLists.txt file, so that you can run these with CMake. If you do not select a pre-existing .cpp file or you don’t have any pre-existing .cpp files, the extension will generate a new “Hello World” .cpp file and add it as a target.\nThis will generate the CMakeLists.txt file that your project will need to build with CMake.\nIt will then enter an optional workflow to generate a CMakePresets.json. CMake presets are a central JSON file that store CMake configurations for CMake actions like configure, build, test, and more. This allows you to seamlessly move your project between desired configurations, other colleagues, different operating systems, and other IDEs.\nIn this workflow, the command palette will prompt you to select a configuration type to use as a configure preset. You can generate from a custom configure preset, a toolchain file, or by scanning your machine for compilers. If you’re just getting started with CMake, we’d recommend creating from compilers. For more on configure presets, please read our docs.\n\nAfter going through the entire updated workflow, you’ll be able to build your .cpp files using CMake with a new CMakeLists.txt file and CMakePresets.json file.\nCMake Presets v7 and v8 Support\nWe have added support for CMake presets files up to version 8 in our VS Code extension.  \nCMake presets v7 includes the support for the trace property in your configure presets. To learn more about the trace property, please visit the CMake Presets official documentation by Kitware. \nWhat do you think?\nDownload the CMake Tools extension for Visual Studio Code and let us know what you think. We would love to see what you contribute to our repo and we are active on reviews and collaboration. Please create an issue if there’s anything you’d like to see and upvote/downvote any existing issues.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "To stay relevant in today’s world of AI revolution, a programming language should be well represented in the ML community and in language models. The less well represented a language is, the lower the quality of generated code, which results in decreased usage of the language and even worse representation. You might be wondering what exactly we mean by “representation”. Read on!\nTo support the future growth of Kotlin popularity and ensure the language is well represented in the new generation of developer tools, we introduce 💜Kotlin ML Pack: a set of necessary tools, data, and models to promote code modeling tasks for the Kotlin language. It is based on extensive research performed by the JetBrains Research team and provides ML researchers with more tools and ideas that they can apply to other programming languages.\nKotlin Data / Datasets\nGood data is the cornerstone of machine learning in any domain, programming languages included. While popular and high-quality datasets to teach and measure various aspects of Python language modeling already exist, such datasets were virtually non-existent for Kotlin. We bridge this gap by collecting and open-sourcing two main datasets: Kotlin language corpus and the dataset of instructions for Kotlin generation.\nLanguage corpus datasets\nThe following two datasets are the result of our research related to language corpus:\nKStack – Kotlin large language corpus. The most complete, permissively licensed, and up-to-date collection of open-source Kotlin code.\nKStack-clean – a curated dataset for better model training. A highly filtered version of KStack containing 25,000 high-quality examples.\n\n\n\n\nThe table below compares the descriptive statistics for these two new datasets and the Kotlin subset of The Stack v2.\n\nFilesRepositoriesLinesTokens\nThe Stack v22M109547162M1.7B\nKStack4M163310293M3.1B\nKStack-clean2500033662M22M\n\n\n\n\n\nKExercises: Kotlin instructions datasets\nAnother focus of our dataset development was the creation of the Kotlin dataset for instruct-tuning. Typically, such datasets consist of sets of instructions or tasks along with their solutions. Training on this data aids models in better comprehending the relationship between natural and programming languages.\nThere are a number of such datasets available, some for the Python programming language and others with multi-language representation. However, in these datasets, Kotlin only has a relatively modest representation, or they do not contain Kotlin at all.\nOur decision was to adapt one of the existing datasets by translating it from Python to Kotlin, rather than creating an entire dataset from scratch. For this purpose, we selected a dataset of Python exercises that demonstrated its functionality and effectiveness. We then used GPT-3.5-turbo to translate the data from Python to Kotlin. After the translation, we manually reviewed a subsample of the data to ensure the accuracy of the translations. Finally, we compiled an instruct dataset comprising 15,000 Kotlin tasks (approximately 3.5M tokens and 335,000 lines of code).\nEvaluation\nAnother vital aspect of machine learning is accurate and efficient evaluation procedures. Thankfully, HumanEval has become a standard for such evaluations in the world of code LLMs. Though initially designed for Python, HumanEval has been translated into multiple programming languages. It has also been adapted for use with compiled languages and has been expanded with new tasks.\nHumanEval for Kotlin\nUnfortunately, the existing HumanEval for Kotlin required significant improvement before it could be used. Therefore, we set out to redo the HumanEval from scratch using a different approach involving human experts.\nAll JetBrains HumanEval solutions and tests were written by an expert competitive programmer with six years of experience in Kotlin and independently checked by a programmer with four years of experience in Kotlin. The tests we implement are equivalent to the original HumanEval tests for Python, and we fix the prompt signatures to address the generic variable signature we describe above.\nThe new HumanEval benchmark is available on Hugging Face, together with usage instructions and benchmark evaluation results for different language models.\nTraining models for Kotlin\nTo showcase our datasets, we trained several models in different setups.\nCode Llama 7B is an autoregressive language model using optimized transformer architectures. It supports infilling text generation, was fine-tuned with up to 16,000 tokens, and supports up to 100,000 tokens at inference time.\nDeepSeek-coder-6.7B base model, implemented by DeepSeek, is a 6.7B-parameter model with Multi-Head Attention trained on two trillion tokens of natural language texts in English and Chinese. It is also pre-trained on project-level code corpus by employing a window size of 16,000 and an extra fill-in-the-blank task to support project-level code completion and infilling. \nDeepSeek-coder-1.3B shares the same architecture and training procedure, but with fewer parameters.\n\n\n\n\nWe used our three datasets mentioned above as part of the training setup. The fine-tuning was performed on an NVIDIA A100 GPU in bf16 precision, using the AdamW optimizer. Additionally, to stabilize the training process, we used a number of various techniques such as Z-loss, weight decay, gradient norm clipping, and others.\nAs a result, we have seen improvements across all approaches that we used. We achieve the most significant boost with a combination of DeepSeek-coder-6.7B and the fine-tuning on the KExercises dataset, resulting in a pass rate of 55.28%. Fine-tuning on instructions produced great results on the other two base models as well. At the same time, fine-tuning on the full dataset gave weak results, increasing the pass rate for CodeLlama by only three percentage points. The clean version of the KStack shows much better results during fine-tuning, but the pass rate is still lower than the one that we achieved with the KExercises dataset.\n\n\n\n\nWe will not stop here. Our goals go beyond just improving the quality of Kotlin code generation. We also strive to provide researchers with more tools and ideas to ensure that in result the developer tooling evolves further in the application of ML to code generation and software development in general.\nThis work and the Kotlin ML Pack that we’ve published cover the essentials of the Kotlin learning pipeline, like data and evaluation. However, the Kotlin and JetBrains ecosystems can offer much more to the language modeling and ML community, such as learning from tools like compilers or linters, additional code for datasets, and new benchmarks more relevant to day-to-day production development tasks.\nFor a deeper dive and a more detailed description of the research by the JetBrains Research team, read the Kotlin ML Pack: Technical Report.\nAlternatively, watch the related section of the KotlinConf’24 keynote.",

Enabling this feature through the Preview icon on the dialog’s toolbar will cause a preview pane to appear under the search results, offering additional context and making it easier to navigate through your project.\n\nAuto-detect proxy enabled by default for new users\nIntelliJ IDEA now automatically detects system proxy settings configured on your machine and uses them by default, facilitating seamless interaction with external resources and services.\n\n\n\n\nKotlin\nImproved K2 mode\nIn IntelliJ IDEA 2024.1, we launched K2 mode (Alpha), which effectively enables a brand-new mechanism for Kotlin support in the IntelliJ IDEA. It brings several stability and performance improvements, along with support for upcoming Kotlin language features. We benchmarked K2 mode against the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate source base and found that its code highlighting performance was nearly twice as good.\nIt will be compatible with all Kotlin versions from 1.9 onwards:\n\n\n\n\nTo activate it, go to Preferences/Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Kotlin and tick the Enable K2 Kotlin Mode checkbox. \n\n\n\n\nIn the current EAP build, K2 mode now enjoys improved stability and adds support for more of IntelliJ IDEA’s features, including:\nRefactorings (Extract Function/Parameter/Property, Inline declaration, Introduce constant)\nInlay hints\nSmart Step Into in the debugger\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of 2024, we aim to have support for most IntelliJ IDEA features and plan to enable K2 mode by default.\nThis is why we need your feedback now! Help us fine-tune K2 mode so we can launch it in top shape. You can share your experiences with us by posting in our public Slack channel or creating an issue in YouTrack. We value your insights!\nOther improvements coming for K2 mode\nVersion 2024.2 will include other major K2 mode features, such as support for the J2K converter, Kotlin Multiplatform, and .gradle.kts.\nWe’re also creating a migration guide for plugin developers to help them migrate their plugins quickly and ensure they are compatible with K2 mode. \nVersion control systems \nUpdated Local History dialog\nWe’ve modernized the UI of the Local History dialog. Additionally, when accessed for a directory, it now features a diff view next to the list of changes, making them easier to understand. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Recent Changes popup has been replaced by a tool window tab, providing a list of changes and a dedicated browser for more convenient navigation and review.\nEnhanced user experience with the Log tool window \nAll settings related to the Log tool window have been consolidated into a dedicated settings page, making it easy to customize its behavior in one convenient location. You can access this page through Settings / Preferences | Version Control | Log or via a new dropdown menu on the Log tool window’s toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can now open the Git log as a tab in the editor, providing more workspace and easier navigation through the list of commits and related details. This action is available through the same dropdown menu in the tool window’s toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains Runtime \nSwitch to JBR 21\nWith IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 EAP 2, we’re transitioning from JetBrains Runtime 17 (JBR17) to JetBrains Runtime 21 (JBR21). Starting with this build, all IntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 updates will come with JBR21, offering enhanced security and performance, as well as Wayland rendering support for Linux.\nThese are the main updates for this week.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "May 30, 2024 update:\n\n\n\nThe initial release of this blog post recommended that customers using older versions of TeamCity upgrade their servers to the latest 2022.x or 2023.x versions.\n\n\nDue to a technical error, bug-fix releases 2022.04.6, 2022.10.5, and 2023.05.5 did not include all of the stated security fixes. Additionally, 2022.04.6 wasn’t automatically compatible with older license keys, as previously stated.\n\n\nWe have now published updated bug-fix releases for 2022.04.x, 2022.10.x, and 2023.05.x. We advise all customers using any of these versions to upgrade to one of these new releases: 2022.04.7, 2022.10.6, or 2023.05.6. Version 2023.11.5 includes all of the previously stated security fixes.\n\n\nCustomers with old (out of maintenance) licenses using TeamCity 2022.04.x or earlier should upgrade to 2022.04.7, which has been made compatible with all older license keys.\n\n\nThe text in this blog post has been modified to reflect these updated recommendations.\n\n\nSummary\nEarlier this year, several critical vulnerabilities were discovered in TeamCity. All versions of TeamCity On-Premises through 2023.11.3 were affected by these vulnerabilities. TeamCity Cloud was not affected.\nWe offered our customers two options to mitigate the vulnerabilities – upgrading to a bug-fix release or installing a security patch plugin.\nWe have since discovered that the security patch plugin doesn’t provide an optimal long-term way of protecting a TeamCity server from these vulnerabilities. In specific edge cases, it might still be possible to bypass the plugin.\nIn our spirit of taking an ethical approach to vulnerability disclosure, we have filed CVE-2024-36470, sharing just enough information to inform our customers without providing full technical details. This minimizes the risk of exploitation. We will be adding more specific details on the issue within the next 60 days.\nWe are releasing bug-fix releases for several older versions of TeamCity, including non-supported versions (2022.04 through 2023.11) with the aforementioned security fixes built-in.\nWe are also enabling customers with much older, out-of-maintenance licenses to install a version of TeamCity with these security fixes built in (version 2022.04.6). Any older TeamCity license will automatically be compatible with this version.\nLastly, we are taking this opportunity to backport a number of fixes for previously disclosed security issues into these new bug-fix releases, enabling all customers to benefit from additional security fixes.\nDetails\nEarlier this year, several critical vulnerabilities were discovered in TeamCity. If abused, the flaws might have enabled an unauthenticated attacker with HTTP(S) access to a TeamCity server to bypass the authentication checks and gain administrative control of the TeamCity server.\nAll versions of TeamCity On-Premises through 2023.11.3 were affected by these vulnerabilities. Customers of TeamCity Cloud had their servers patched right away and weren’t affected.\nTo mitigate the risks introduced by these vulnerabilities, we offered our customers two options. The first option was updating their servers to the latest version, which included patches for the discovered vulnerabilities.\nFor customers who were unable to update their server, we offered a second option – applying a security patch plugin. However, we have since discovered the security patch plugin doesn’t provide an optimal long-term way of protecting a TeamCity server from these vulnerabilities. In specific edge cases, it might still be possible to bypass the plugin. \nIn our spirit of taking an ethical approach to vulnerability disclosure, we have filed CVE-2024-36470, sharing just enough information to inform our customers, without providing full technical details. This minimizes the risk of exploitation. We will be adding more specific details on the issue within the next 60 days.\nOur customers’ safety is our utmost priority. In order to protect our customers from any potential security threats, we’ve rolled out major bug-fix releases for several older versions of TeamCity (versions 2022.04 through 2023.11). These new releases include fixes for the aforementioned security vulnerabilities, negating the requirement to use a security patch plugin.\nWe have also taken this opportunity to backport a number of fixes for previously disclosed security issues into these new bug-fix releases, enabling all customers to benefit from additional security fixes.\nAll TeamCity customers are, therefore, able to upgrade to a fixed version:\nCustomers with versions 2021.2 and older can upgrade their servers to version 2022.04.6 free of charge. Any older Enterprise Server and Build Agent licenses that are out of maintenance will automatically be compatible with version 2022.04.6. See the FAQ for more details.\n\n\n\n\nCustomers using 2022.04 or a more recent version can upgrade to the respective bug-fix release within their major version (2022.04.7, 2022.10.6, 2023.05.6, 2023.11.5).\nTo update, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/download/other.html and download one of these bug-fix releases. Alternatively, you can perform an automatic update via Administration | Updates directly in TeamCity.\nPlease refer to the release notes relevant to your version of TeamCity for more details:\n2022.04.7\n2022.10.6\n2023.05.6\n2023.11.5\nThe vulnerabilities did not affect version 2024.03, so today we are releasing 2024.03.2 as a regular bug-fix update.\nWe strongly recommend that all TeamCity On-Premises customers upgrade their servers to the latest available version. If you have any questions regarding this announcement or encounter problems upgrading, please get in touch with the TeamCity Support team by submitting a ticket.\nFrequently asked questions\nI’m currently running an affected version of TeamCity but have the security patch plugin installed. Should I upgrade my server to one of the newly released versions? \nYes, we strongly recommend upgrading to one of the new bug-fix versions listed above, even if you have the security patch plugin installed. Fixes for the aforementioned security issues are now built into the product, along with a selection of less severe security fixes for previously disclosed vulnerabilities being backported to each of these new bug-fix releases. The security patch plugin can be uninstalled from the server after it has been updated to one of these new bug-fix releases.\nI am using TeamCity Enterprise 2017.2, and my paid licenses lapsed on their maintenance in 2018. Can I upgrade to 2022.04.7 free of charge?\nYes, we have specifically made the new 2022.04.7 bug-fix release compatible with all old license keys (even if you still use TeamCity 7.0, released back in 2012). It is important to note that only the 2022.04.7 release has been made compatible with all older license keys.\nThis will enable all customers to benefit from a more secure version of TeamCity, regardless of whether their licenses are under active maintenance.\nI am using TeamCity Enterprise 2023.05.4, and my licenses have since lapsed on their maintenance. Can I upgrade to the 2023.05.6 bug-fix release for no charge? \nYes, all bug-fix releases within a major version number (e.g. 2023.05) are compatible with the license keys for that version, meaning you can install the minor update for no charge. For example, license keys compatible with 2023.05 are valid for all minor versions within 2023.05.x.\nI am using the free TeamCity Professional license on version 2018.x and also purchased some additional build agent licenses in 2018. Those additional agent licenses have been out of maintenance since 2019. Can I upgrade to 2022.04.7 and still use my additional build agent licenses with that version?\nYes, any old build agent license keys will automatically be valid for use with the new 2022.04.7 bug-fix release.\nShould I manually remove the security patch plugin from the server after updating it to one of the new bug-fix releases?\nYes, the security patch plugin is no longer required after you upgrade to one of the new bug-fix releases (2022.04.7, 2022.10.6, 2023.05.6, or 2023.11.5) and will be ignored on server start-up. It can be safely removed after upgrading to one of these versions.\nI have been using a vulnerable version of TeamCity. How can I check my server hasn’t already been compromised?\nPlease check out our guide on investigating a compromised TeamCity on-premises server and its build environment.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we’re passionate about new technology and always excited to share our latest in-house fun. \nThis April, we kicked off our internal AI Hackathon in collaboration with Google and with the support of our internal JetBrains AI and AI Assistant team. It was designed to get our teammates to step out of their daily routines and challenge themselves with ambitious projects. Our partnership with Google gave us exclusive preview access to advanced LLMs like Gemini Pro and Ultra, and we then took things to the next level by using these models in our own projects.\nRepresentatives from Google participated in our hackathon at the Munich and Amsterdam offices. They provided on-site support, served on the jury board, and delivered pre-hackathon enablement sessions and keynotes.\n\n\n\n    \nDmitriy Novakovskiy – Head of Customer Engineering, Google Cloud | Digital Natives, Central & Eastern Europe\nIt is the most humbling and rewarding feeling for us at Google Cloud to see the great things developers make happen with our technology. With the recent Gemini x JetBrains hackathon, we were happy to see the community of brilliant engineers (at JetBrains) putting our latest Gemini Ultra and Pro 1.5 models through a rigorous test – in the most creative context possible! We were truly inspired by all of the useful projects that came out of just two short days, many of which were truly innovative and “production-worthy”.\nThe team and I really enjoyed co-hosting this event with the JetBrains team, and we are very much looking forward to doing more of those, always with the “best of Google” technology brought to the table.\nIn this blog, we’ll share more about this event, reveal the winners, and take a closer look at their amazing projects. Prepare to be inspired!\nWhat, why, and how \nPreps \nOne week before the hackathon, the Google team presented several “pre-hackathon” sessions focused on best practices for using Gemini models. These presentations were designed to get us fired up and ready for the event. \nRules \nOnce we were all ready to go, the rules and categories for the experiments were announced. \nThis hackathon was exclusively for JetBrains employees, and teaming up was allowed. Before the event started, teams could only brainstorm and prepare, no coding was permitted! Then for three days straight, our talented and creative teammates worked on turning their ideas into reality to compete in one of the following categories:\nUser Experience.\nFor those who wanted to use AI to make developer tools more interactive and personalized. This included things like voice interaction, new interactive elements to enhance daily tasks like tips and activity summaries, and IDE personalization.\nNew features for AI Assistant/ YouTrack with Google Gemini LLMs. \nFor those who wanted to design or improve software development tools with Google models. Possible activities in this category included code reviews for projects, new features for the AI Assistant plugin in IntelliJ, ReSharper, and Fleet, and functionality enhancements for YouTrack.\nAfter the Hackathon, the jury chose three winners, who received monetary prizes and some Google-sponsored gifts. Furthermore, every JetBrains employee got to cast their own vote for the winner of the AI Hackathon Trophy.\n\n\n\n\nWinners and their projects\nNow for the fun part! In this section, we’ll announce the winners and show you their projects. We’ve also gathered some thoughts on the event from participants, which we’ll share below. \nThe AI Hackathon Trophy \nWorkOut\nUI/UX\nAI Review Assistant\nHey, Fleet! Controlling your IDE through chat/voice\nDebug Simulator\nGoogle Models\nAI Review Assistant\nAI Assignee\nWorkOut \n\n\n\n\nLet’s see what the projects were about! \nWorkOut \nOxana Shumilova, Nikita Volkov, and Alexander Khokhlyavin\nEver feel out of the loop after taking a few days off or when you’re new to a project? Keeping up with the ongoing conversations and updates can be challenging.\nThat’s why we’ve developed a Slack bot to help you to avoid frustration! With just a simple command like /sum, you can get a customized summary of any channel, thread, or selected discussion group. \nKey benefits:\nQuick updates: Get briefed on all the essential updates without going through each conversation.\nSeamless onboarding: New to the team? Get a comprehensive summary to help you find your feet faster.\nCustomization: Choose the channels, threads, and time periods you’re interested in.\n\n\n\n    \nAlexander Khokhlyavin\nThe idea for the project came to me while I was on vacation. So, imagine this: I’m chilling on the beach, minding my own business, when I overhear some work chatter on the phone. Suddenly, all thoughts of sun and sand are replaced by dread about catching up on work stuff when I get back. But instead of letting it ruin my vibe, I think, “Hey, wouldn’t it be awesome if there was a tool that could do all this catching up for me?” And just like that, our AI Hackathon project was born!\nNikita Volkov\nWe started by surveying users with a Google Form, offering early access to the bot. This formed the basis for our advertising campaign. Then, we refined the concept and functionality. Some ideas came up during casual discussions with colleagues in the kitchen. We realized it was crucial to keep the solution simple and user-friendly, given the limited time. During the hackathon, we went from “Can we really pull this off?” to “This is gonna be epic!” It was a rollercoaster of emotions but it was worth it! \nOxana Shumilova\nDuring all our Hackathons together, we’ve always kept the positive vibes. So, for our presentation, we wanted to bring that same energy: positivity, humor, and fun. That’s when we had a brilliant idea: Let’s kick off with a hilarious sketch about someone coming back from vacation!\nAs the clock ticked down to the end of the hackathon, we were in a race against time. Sasha sent me our video just minutes before the deadline. I was also in charge of putting the final touches on the video. Easy, right? Not exactly – the video was taking forever to render. We were rushing, nervous, and on edge. The hackathon presentation started at 13:00, and our video was finally ready at 13:03! But hey – we made it! \nAI Review Assistant \nAnastasia Shabalina, Ivan Semenov, Nikolay Rykunov, Egor Bogomolov, and Alexander Koshevoy \nAnastasia Shabalina\nThe idea of integrating AI into the code review process made perfect sense, as this process is crucial but time-consuming for developers. Initially, our VCS team had about ten ideas for the hackathon and joked about selling them, but it was tough to choose the best. After pitching and voting, the AI Review Assistant didn’t make the initial cut.\nFeeling we might be overlooking something, I revisited our list and gathered feedback from 10 random colleagues. Many supported the AI Review Assistant and expressed their eagerness to use it immediately. Encouraged by this feedback, we decided to pursue it at the AI Hackathon. With Ivan Semenov, Nikolay Rykunov, Egor Bogomolov, and Alexander Koshevoy, we refined the idea.\nOriginally, we planned for AI to handle reviews independently, but it became clear that AI was better suited to assist. Thus, from the initial idea of generating ready-made comments, we expanded the concept. Now, AI Assistant includes a to-do guide plan for reviews with code navigation, AI-generated comments in the editor, and the ability to clarify details directly within the comments.\nBy the end of the first day, we’d built a working prototype and had all had a great time, complete with music and singing.\nUltimately, the AI Review Assistant emerged as our winning project, directly addressing real user needs and exciting the team. We were thrilled to win 1st place in both categories at the hackathon. We were already planning to bring our AI Review Assistant to production, but this victory has given us extra energy and motivation. We hope our users will soon see the AI Review Assistant in their IDEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHey, Fleet! Controlling your IDE through chat/voice \nValentin Fondaratov, Alina Mishina, Aleksandr Chernokoz, Artem Bobrov, Titouan Bion, and Vladislav Protasov\nThe team aimed to enable voice control for Fleet. The goal was to develop a natural language search that comprehends user commands and assists them by changing settings, executing actions, or explaining features based on their spoken requests.\nAleksandr Chernokoz\nOver the past year, we’ve been working hard to add AI features to Fleet, with the AI Assistant chat serving as a key starting point for using LLM-based features. We saw the potential for voice input and decided to develop our “voice control” project. The “voice” part refers to accepting spoken commands, but “control” goes deeper – it means allowing the LLM model to manage the IDE by triggering actions or changing settings.\nOur project is also interesting because it uses a wake-up word to activate the voice assistant and relies on four different models: a local model for the wake-up word, and remote models for speech-to-text, LLM, and text-to-speech. This setup makes it great for a hackathon, as it breaks down into separate tasks that team members can work on at the same time and then combine when ready.\nAI Assignee\nMaksim Zheltoukhov and Vladimir Zatsepin\nThe idea behind the project was to create a digital team member that handles development tasks just like a human colleague. AI Assignee was designed to perform straightforward coding assignments with a bit of guidance.\nHere’s how it works! Suppose there’s a task in YouTrack with a title such as “Ensure the FooBar REST API endpoint returns a BadRequest error if the ‘foo’ field is missing.” This task is seamlessly assigned to AI Assignee. Mimicking a typical developer’s workflow, AI Assignee takes charge of the task, asks any necessary clarifying questions, creates a merge request, implements the required fixes, and completes the task once the merge request is approved.\n\n\n\n    \nMaxim Zheltoukhov\nFirst of all, I’d like to emphasize what an amazing hackathon this was! Having Google there was incredible, as it gave us access to their advanced large language models (LLMs). These new tools really changed the game, opening up tons of new possibilities and taking our AI Hackathon participation to the next level.\nAs for our project, it started by wondering what AI could do beyond simple text chats. Could AI handle bigger tasks? This question led to a brainstorming session with Vladimir Zatsepin, where we developed some innovative technical solutions. We equipped the AI with developer tools and showed it how to use them. As a result, we created a system that can write code based on the tasks, manage merge requests, and handle comments. This project pushed AI beyond its current limits and shows a future where AI could become a reliable and innovative helper.\nDebug simulator \nElizaveta Shashkova, Pavel Karateev, and Aleksandr Slapoguzov\nUsing a debugger with real applications can be complicated and slow with lots of additional setups. Debug Simulator simplifies this! Debug Simulator is a tool that interprets debugging commands from an IDE and simulates responses, mimicking real runtime behavior without actual code execution. The team has designed the tool so that it can predict outcomes for variable states, method executions, and more.\nElizaveta Shashkova\nWe were a fortunate team because all three of us were located in Amsterdam. We came to the office, occupied one of the meeting rooms, and spent two wonderful days hacking together, discussing solutions, and drawing on a whiteboard – just like in the good old pre-COVID times!\nOur team had a great variety of skills: Alexander had experience in creating features for AI Assistant, Elizaveta had experience with debugger UIs, and Pavel was our expert in prompt engineering. Therefore, the tasks were naturally split amongst us, and we were able to implement them quickly without stepping on each other’s toes.\nAlthough we conducted a lot of experiments with different prompts, there was still a small sense of fear that once the implementation was complete, the LLM might stop providing us with desirable answers or start to hallucinate at some random moment. We were so surprised and delighted when, in the end, our debugger worked! And it worked exceptionally well on simple code snippets!\nTaking part in this hackathon and implementing some fun and unusual ideas was a truly enjoyable experience!\nOverall, the AI Hackathon was an amazing experience! Here is what Horia Niculescu had to say about it: \nHoria Niculescu – Customer Engineer – Data, AI, ML, Google\nI’ll start by saying a huge kudos to JetBrains for being such a fantastic partner to Google in the AI space. This hackathon is yet another chapter in the incredible collaboration and shared vision between our teams.\nDuring the hackathon I was blown away by the talent at JetBrains. All teams displayed a rare combo of business savviness and technical wizardry. It’s evident in the way they hacked together product features and organizational solutions that genuinely make a difference.\nWhether it’s the code writing or code reviewing, the productivity hacks have the potential to boost developer productivity tenfold. My favorite project is the catch-up-on-work-after-vacation assistant – brilliant, fun, and crazy useful. Where do I subscribe?\nI’m genuinely excited to see how these projects will be rolled out in production and how this partnership continues to unfold. I’m confident that together, we’ll deliver even more value to our customers in the months and years ahead. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries!\n43 projects were presented at the AI Hackathon, and we want to thank everyone for their participation! We’re looking forward to an equally successful event next year! And stay tuned for upcoming JetBrains AI Assistant updates – some amazing new features are on the way, including support for new LLMs. \nGet JetBrains AI Assistant",

In light of this, we’ve recently launched the EAP for Qodana’s C and C++ linter, a tool designed to run static code analysis and provide deep insights into your work.\nIn this post, we’ll dive into the essential features of Qodana’s C and C++ linter and explore how you can apply it in your project and software development workflow!\n\n\n\n\nExplore Qodana\nWrite safer code in C and C++ \nC and especially C++ languages are tricky for developers. They give you great power but also various challenges when dealing directly with memory, dangling pointers, null pointer dereferencing, and lifetime issues which are typical for C++ code. \nWhy use Qodana for C and C++ analysis?\nA powerful code analyser can save you from problems like these and keep your code in a good shape. This is especially important for areas where safe code is critical, like embedded development and automotive.\nAlso, Qodana can help you increase your source code’s MISRA compliance*, as well as extend standard Clang-Tidy inspections by supplying CLion’s additional inspections and some MISRA checks. These standards were created to prioritize safe, secure, and reliable code and are widely used in automotive as a must-follow standard. \nUltimately, server-side analysis with Qodana leads to a more efficient code analysis process, with a long list of benefits for software development teams that want to level up code quality.\n\n\n\n\nOn the team level, Qodana can help by providing reports with aggregated information about the project: the number of problems, their distribution by types, files, and so on. This allows teams to ensure that any code change undergoe the same code quality checks (instead of relying purely on IDEs), and provides an overview of the project state within the team.\nImprove codebase maintainability and readability\nAddress coding standard violations to improve product quality. Qodana’s C and C++ linter helps your team adhere to best practices, resulting in a more cohesive and maintainable codebase.\nWhat’s under the hood?\nDashboard view\nKnow for sure which project needs your immediate attention. Get an overview of your team’s progress in one dashboard, including the number and severity of detected problems.\nA Baseline feature for tabling issues\nPut less-critical issues (or simply all detected issues) to the baseline to stop receiving notifications about them. This can help your team stay focused on the issues that matter most.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration into CI/CD pipelines\nQodana integrates smoothly into your team’s CI/CD pipelines for continuous code quality checks. This identifies issues early in the development life cycle, helping you reduce the cost of fixing problems and prevent them from escalating. \nCustomizable quality gates\nYou can also tailor the linter to your project’s requirements with customizable quality gates. Define and enforce coding standards, as well as other quality metrics unique to your development team. This way you can help enforce rules and make sure nothing slips through the cracks. \nRun Qodana locally or in your CI pipeline\nQodana’s C/C++ linter can mean a leap forward in your team’s code quality while supporting your existing code analysis process. Run it locally or in your CI pipeline to get an overview of problems, detailed analysis, real-time feedback, and seamless IDE and CI/CD integration.\nWant to know more? \nlearn more about how Qodana can help your team and your business, post a comment here, tag us on X (formerly Twitter) or LinkedIn, or contact us at qodana-support@jetbrains.com.\nYou can also view the documentation for Qodana C/C++. \nExplore Qodana\n*Qodana currently supports analysis for some MISRA checks with more on the way.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introducing package managers into the modern development workflow has been nothing short of transformative. If you’ve been a .NET developer for a long time, you may remember when we shared .dll files on community sites and consumed them from a lib folder at the root of our solution. Thanks to NuGet, those dark days of .NET are over, and we are all the more productive for it.\nWhen a .NET developer mentions NuGet, they could refer to several concepts. \nFor instance, NuGet is a hosting service provided by Microsoft that makes community packages available through an API. This service also has a public UI in the form of NuGet.org. On the site, developers can search for new and existing packages to add to their applications.\nOther mentions of NuGet could refer to the local executable, a powerful tool that puts you in control of your package management. It manages interaction with the hosting service, package caches, package sources, and more. You can access the tool using the dotnet CLI tooling.\ndotnet nuget --help\nIn this post, we’ll look at nine exciting features of JetBrains Rider’s integration with NuGet, the service and tooling you may not have known. Let’s get into it!\nDownload JetBrains Rider\n                                                    \nThe NuGet Tool Window and Info Galore\nJetBrains Rider spoils us with the information found in the NuGet Tool Window. This window provides direct access to package search results and additional information about a package and its dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nIn the screenshot, you’ll see you have access to a package, any packages it implicitly installs, and any crucial links to repositories, documentation, licenses, and the supported target frameworks.\nNote: Use the arrow keys and press Alt+Enter to work with the NuGet tool window even faster.\nThis information can help you make an informed decision about whether to install any package. Rather than trying to remember packages by name and potentially installing an incorrect package, we’ve spent considerable time creating a well-thought-out experience that will significantly save JetBrains Rider users time.\nSources Management\nEnterprise developers typically rely on public and private NuGet package sources, and understanding where a package’s install source is is critical to professional software development.\nIn the NuGet Tool Window’s Sources tab, developers can see all the NuGet sources and their order of precedence concerning package resolution.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also manage sources by adding and removing feeds from each source layer. Have complete control over your package consumption workflow.\nCache Management\nThe NuGet tooling caches installed packages in system directories that many developers may be unfamiliar with. JetBrains Rider surfaces these NuGet cache folders so you can stay informed about the resources NuGet is utilizing in your development environment.\n\n\n\n\nThe cache helps improve package installation across solutions, but as packages get versioned and updated by authors, your cache can become weighed down by outdated, obsolete, and unused packages. \nUse JetBrains Rider to clear any caches and free up critical resources.\nOpen Packages in Assembly Explorer\nPackage authors and curious developers will appreciate that JetBrains Rider allows them to open any installed packages (explicitly or implicitly) in the Assembly Explorer.\nThis view can help you diagnose and quickly fix packing issues in a package.\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Explorer in JetBrains Rider is a powerful tool that allows you to open any assembly using the dotPeek decompiler integration. This feature enables you to explore the delivered code within each package, giving you a deeper understanding of the package’s functionality.\nPrerelease Checkbox\nPackage authors will publish prerelease packages on the NuGet service for those other developers who love living on the edge. These packages provide functionality that’s still early and evolving but ready for user feedback.\n\n\n\n\nTo try out newer .NET ecosystem features and libraries, check the Prerelease box for the experimental and preview packages.\nSecurity with Checkmarx\nSecurity is a serious subject, and our NuGet tool helps keep you informed about the latest security vulnerabilities in your dependencies with Checkmarx advisories.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have installed or will install a vulnerable package, you will see a warning in your tool window. Vulnerabilities will also surface in JetBrains Rider’s Problem View.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t miss a chance to keep your users safe from security threats.\nFind Dependent Code\nIf you’ve ever looked at a package and wondered, “What the heck does this do?” then you’re not alone. In JetBrains Rider, you can right-click any NuGet package, select Find Dependent Code, and find the parts of the codebase that rely on the code within the package.\n\n\n\n\nOnce selected, you’ll see a Find window with all the locations that depend on symbols from the package.\n\n\n\n\nThe feature can help you determine how critical a dependency is to your solution and whether it’s worth upgrading, removing, or leaving alone.\nUpgrade Packages All At Once\n.NET developers are famous (or infamous, depending on who you ask) for having many packages for one logical dependency. With JetBrains Rider, you can easily upgrade multiple packages using the Upgrade packages in Solution dialog.\n\n\n\n\nCheck the packages you want to upgrade collectively and hit the Upgrade button. The dialog and upgrade path will save you time and get you back into the flow.\nNote: If you start with search criteria in the NuGet tool window, only those matching installed packages will be carried over to the Upgrade packages in Solution dialog window. For large solutions with many dependencies, this can make the selective upgrade process more pleasant.\n\r\n\r\n\nAll Those “Extra” NuGet Settings\nNuGet is typically straightforward, but many intricate settings ensure you’re covered. In the Settings window, you can configure NuGet to change the restore behavior, the default credentials providers, search sources, and the uninstall behavior.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nI hope you found this short post informative and helpful. Nobody wants to mess around with opaque tooling where the only information to you exists in a package name. JetBrains Rider’s NuGet integration is a first-class experience thoughtfully designed to increase productivity. With these tips, you should now have the information to install, update, and remove packages confidently.\nCheck out our official documentation if you’d like to learn more about the NuGet integration. Also, please let us know if you have any questions or comments.\nimage credit: Jiawei Zhao",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/writerside/2024/05/come-to-writerside-we-get-docs-published/",
        "pubDate": "Tue, 28 May 2024 16:54:21 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "5 customer stories, 6 “aha moments”, and so many things to fix. 🤓\nAccording to the Developer Ecosystem Survey, 10–12% of software developers also write docs. Most developers dislike writing docs, viewing them as a necessary but tedious part of maintaining complex products. At Writerside, we see documentation as a crucial product feature that is just as important as the product UI. Not only do docs convey style and tone, but they also serve as a medium for providing product knowledge and user assistance. It’s our job and our mission to give developers a tool that allows them to enjoy writing documentation. And just like everyone else, we hate paying big bucks for a doc authoring tool.\nThat’s why we’ve poured our hearts and souls into developing Writerside – a solution for those who need to:\nProvide great user assistance for their products.\nStop choosing between markup languages.\nAchieve good-looking results by default, without the hassle of design and CSS.\nCollaborate on texts and images as seamlessly as they do on code.\nSave time and money.\nAchieve excellent results – fast!\nWith this in mind, we interviewed our first Early Access Program users to get an outside view on the product.\n1. “I…find myself suddenly enjoying writing documentation.”\n–Alex Suzuki, the author of STRICH, a popular barcode scanning library for web apps. \nAlex uses Writerside for the vast majority of STRICH’s documentation, including tutorials, integration guides, and sample code.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://docs.strich.io/getting-started.html\n\n\n\n\n🤩 The “aha” moment\nAlex is a heavy user of JetBrains IDEs, so the “aha” moment with Writerside was when he realized it had a familiar UI that “made [him] feel at home and gave [him] confidence”.\n Indeed, Writerside is based on the IntelliJ Platform, and this makes it a natural docs-as-code solution. The JetBrains tools that have been wowing developers for many years already are now being adopted and adapted for writing and publishing structured product content. This includes technical documentation first and foremost, but they are also useful for creators of any type of structured content.\n😿 What was missing? \nThe one feature Alex really misses right now is some way to integrate a TypeScript documentation generator to create an API reference directly from the source code.\n Is this something you’d be interested in, too? Add your vote to this ticket.\n2. “We now have a single source of truth for all of our product information (including documents, images, and pricing) that can be accessed both internally and externally by our wholesale network.”\n–Doug Niccum, Software Engineering Manager at Schier, which has undergone a relatively significant digital transformation. \nUnifying all product-related materials in Schier’s Product API has become a remedy against branding and informational disparity. Now Schier has a single source of truth for all types of information – documents, images, and even pricing – that is accessible both internally and externally to the wholesale network. To create this new Product API portal, the company has “hired” Writerside. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://api-docs.schierproducts.com/\n\n\n\n\n🤩 The “aha” moment\nFirst, it was working with the built-in UI elements that let them bring depth and personalization into documentation. To quote Doug, “If you want to create pages/documents that aren’t just ‘a wall of text’, Writerside really sets itself apart. Tabs, category blocks, and syntax-highlighted code blocks, all come out of the box with little to no customization.”\nAnother benefit for Doug was the ability to display the custom OpenAPI spec with requests, errors, and sample responses directly within the documentation. The OpenAPI parsing feature served them well and helped them make the documentation rich and organized. \n Here is a Writerside recipe for you:\nTake the Markdown files you have and import them into Writerside. \nAdd interactive components and publish docs that are compact and visually appealing, just like the IntelliJ IDEA docs, for instance. \n😿 What was missing? \nThe most cumbersome part of Doug’s Writerside experience was learning how to use the XML-based UI elements or some of the configuration files. That required a lot of trial and error. “If I had one wish granted, that would be a GUI for managing all of the meta, social images, and settings for my documentation. XML-based settings are way too difficult,” says Doug. \n With great power comes a lot of usability work. We’re not sure exactly what solution we’ll come up with, but we’re working on making the UI components more discoverable and less fragile. \n3. “The seamless integration with GitHub Pages saved me significant time.”\n–Ranit Malik, a second-year undergraduate student studying computer science. \nRanit prefers to document his learning journey online instead of using physical notes. Initially, Ranit stored his notes in GitHub repositories in the Markdown format. Now he uses Writerside to publish documentation on topics ranging from HTML and CSS to C, DSA, Java, and JavaScript. This is one of Ranit’s docs, which focuses on the C language: \nhttps://ranitmanik.github.io/C-documentation/page-01-02.html\n\n\n\n\n🤩 The “aha” moment\nOne of the biggest “aha’ moments was using seamless integration with GitHub Pages, which streamlined the deployment process. \n😿 What was missing? \nRanit has briefly identified what he sees as the main areas of improvement for Writerside: \nA custom search solution that would not require users to configure Algolia.\nImproved offline access.\nMore UI customization options and theming support. \nApart from the product features mentioned above, Ranit would also like to see YouTube tutorials and a free JetBrains AI trial. \nWe are glad (and quite proud!) to say that we’ve implemented two of the items from Ranit’s list in a recent EAP build, the JetBrains AI Assistant integration will be available in the next release that’s coming out in a few days, and we’re working on documentation customization right now (keep an eye on the issue and comments for more detail).\n4. “Not having to configure anything was a real game changer!”\n–Johann Pardanaud, the developer behind Akkurate, a validation library that helps constrain user input, mainly to avoid bugs and security issues. The validation code is written in Kotlin with a beautiful declarative API. \n\n\n\n\nhttps://akkurate.dev/docs/overview.html\n\n\n\n\n🤩 The “aha” moment\nThe documentation for Akkurate had to provide a large feature set, ideally without requiring much configuration. “With Writerside, everything worked out of the box,” says Johann, “and you can even preview all the changes right in the editor.”\n Live preview is one of the features we couldn’t live without either. You can use different markup languages in the editor and different formatting, but the preview always shows you the final look and feel of your doc, just as it will appear when published. For an even more immersive experience, you can also press the Open in Browser button in the top right corner of the preview. \n\n\n\n\n😿 What was missing? \nIn Johann’s case, the inability to customize the top bar or use custom icons on the starting page was one. of the biggest shortcomings. \n You’ve identified one of our most crucial missing features. But rest assured that we’re working on bringing it to you! It’s a big one, so thanks for your patience! 🤗\n5. “The one thing that was exceptionally impressive was the inclusion of Mermaid, LaTeX, and code highlighting!”\n–John Chang, Lead ML Engineer and PhD Student, who has successfully migrated 3 major projects to Writerside: FRDC-ML, MixMatch-PyTorch-CIFAR10, and ReamberPy.\n\n\n\n\n🤩 The “aha” moment\nIn John’s words:\n“Personally, I just want something that:\nWorks out of the box with Markdown (because it’s easy)\nIs publishable on GitHub Pages (because it’s free)\nLooks good enough by default\nI found out Writerside does all of that and more. It just works in the IDE. It has in-built dark and light modes, and docs can be versioned in the same repository with code. \nI’m also glad that Writerside is just a plugin that I can one-click download. I was dreading wrangling with npm, pyvenv, or whatever new environment I had to struggle with next.”\n Writerside comes in two flavors – a plugin for IntelliJ-based IDEs and a standalone editor. And while this means more maintenance work for us, we’re glad to offer support for those who would rather work on code and docs in the same IDE, and for those who want a separate tool for docs and another for code. \n😿 What was missing? \nThe biggest challenges for John were “the HTML-like tags, many indentations, and problems with code reformatting. Also, I’d like to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically from CI/CD. Besides, as a big fan of Obsidian, I’d love to edit docs right in the preview. That would solve that ‘HTML-tag’ indentation problem, but it’s probably a pretty big wish.”\n Giving users the ability to edit in the live preview would be a tough task indeed, but we might add this eventually, too. Don’t hesitate to share your ideas with us – we’re always keen to engage with our users. Get in touch via our Slack channel or the dedicated issue tracker.\nEarly access -> early success\nAt JetBrains, using our own tooling is the norm and the first proof that the product can do the job it was designed for. However, “dogfooding” can run the risk of narrowing our horizons and shifting our priorities to fit only our own use cases. To avoid this, we make our products public as early as possible. These releases are far from fully ready to market, but they’re still able to get some serious work done. A real person creating a real thing with our product can provide much more insight than a usability test or marketing analysis. \nJoin our Early Access Program, download Writerside, use it to build something, and tell us what worked and what didn’t. \nLet’s create the best tool for all those who write docs – together! 🤝",

If you haven’t already seen what to expect in WebStorm 2024.2, take a moment to explore our roadmap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Toolbox App is the easiest way to get the EAP builds and keep both your stable and EAP versions up to date. You can also manually download the EAP builds from our website.\nDOWNLOAD WEBSTORM 2024.2 EAP\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that WebStorm EAP builds are not fully tested and might be unstable.\nBelow, you can find the most interesting improvements available in WebStorm 2024.2 EAP 1 and 2. Try them out and share your feedback using our issue tracker or comment below.\nNew Features\nWebStorm now recognizes implicitly used configs of tools and frameworks\nMany configurations of tools and frameworks are often exported and used implicitly, leading to them being marked as unused by the IDE. WebStorm now recognizes such cases and eliminates annoying false positive warnings. The following configs are currently supported:\nPrettier\nESLint\nJest\nVite\nVitest\nCypress\nTailwind CSS\nPostCSS\nSvelte\nAstro\n\n\n\n\nSvelte 5 snippets support\nSvelte 5 is on the way, and in WebStorm EAPs, you can already try out the new Svelte snippets and render tags. These snippets are designed to create reusable chunks of markup within your components:\n\n\n\n\nNode.js test runner now supports TypeScript files\nWebStorm now provides the ability to run tests written in TypeScript using a Node.js test runner. The corresponding run configuration has auto-detection for ts-node and tsx loaders as well as the ability to set up a custom TypeScript loader.\n\n\n\n\nReworked inlay hints in TypeScript files\nWe’ve reworked inlay hints in TypeScript to better align with the information provided by the TypeScript service. Inlay hints are retrieved only for the currently visible screen and the screens immediately above and below it (though this can be configured in the settings). This may cause hints to appear gradually when scrolling quickly, and you might notice that previously rendered hints are re-rendered when you scroll back. This behavior is expected and designed to optimize performance. Please report any problems in the following issue.\nEnhanced user experience with the Log tool window\nAll settings related to the Log tool window are now consolidated into a dedicated settings page, making it easy to customize its behavior in one convenient location. You can access this page through Settings | Version Control | Log or via a new dropdown menu on the Log tool window’s toolbar:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can now open the Git Log as an editor tab, providing more workspace and easier navigation through the list of commits and related details:\n\n\n\n\n--first-parent and --no-merges options support in the Git log UI\nGit has a useful option for viewing the history of changes in a branch: --first-parent. This option simplifies the log by hiding individual commits that came with the merge, making it easier to track changes. We’ve also added filtering with the --no-merges command, which displays the history without any merge commits. \nBoth options can be selected under the Graph Options button in the Git tool window.\n\n\n\n\nPreview option in Search Everywhere\nThe Search Everywhere dialog now includes an option to preview the codebase elements you’re searching for. You can enable the preview through the icon on the dialog’s toolbar:\n\nOther highlights\nHere’s an overview of the key improvements for various technologies supported by WebStorm, along with some notable bug fixes:\nStarting from EAP 2, WebStorm comes with JetBrains Runtime 21, which offers enhanced security and performance, as well as Wayland rendering support for Linux. See the following issue for more details: JBR-5855.\nWe’ve fixed auto-completion for Tailwind CSS classes when using a remote Node.js interpreter (Docker/SSH) WEB-53172.\nWe’ve made fixes for auto-imports of Vue 3 components WEB-62179, WEB-65059.\nWe fixed applying auto-import in multi-caret mode WEB-41699.\nFor the full list of improvements available in WebStorm 2024.1 EAP 1 and 2, check out the release notes. Stay tuned for our next EAP digest sometime in the middle of the EAP cycle!\nThe WebStorm team",

We’ve streamlined the essential features into a modern UI to help you discover great new extensions and manage your installed extensions. \nWith this release, we still want to hear from you! As you use the Extension Manager in this last preview phase, please share your thoughts so we can bring you the best possible experience in our upcoming official release.\n \nMeet the new Extension Manager\nGone are the days of leaving Visual Studio to find additional information on extensions! We created the new Extension Manager to spotlight the most important content when searching for extensions, including a large pane for viewing detailed descriptions.\n\nThe left sidebar has lets you choose between primary views:\nBrowse the Visual Studio Marketplace for new extensions\nView and manage your Installed extensions\nDiscover and install any available Updates for your extensions\nInstall any extensions for which you have Roaming enabled\n\n \nFilter your searches\nYou can click the filter icon to the right of the search box to show the category and subcategory menus, which you can use to filter the search results. For example, you can search for tools to help with documentation or for ASP.NET controls.\n\n \nLet us know what you think!\nThe new Extension Manager is available to all Visual Studio 17.10 users and is on-by-default.\nIf for any reason you want to return to the previous Extension Manager, you can disable the preview feature by navigating to Tools > Manage Preview Features and unchecking the box for the feature called Extension Manager UI Refresh. To reenable the new Extension Manager, check the box for the preview feature and restart Visual Studio.\nAs you use the new Extension Manager, please use this ticket on Developer Community to share your thoughts and feedback.  We want to hear from you about anything that might be missing or that could be improved.\nIf you run into any bugs or issues, please report them so we can prioritize fixing them.\nThe post A modern Extension Manager has arrived with Visual Studio 17.10 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Imagine creating extensions that run faster and smoother than ever before! If you haven’t been following along lately, we’ve been working on improving the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK. VisualStudio.Extensibility helps you build extensions that run outside the main IDE process for improved performance and reliability. With it comes a sleek and intuitive .NET 8-based API and comprehensive, well-maintained documentation to help you develop awesome extensions.\nThis 17.10 release builds on our previous releases, and it brings with it a brand-new debugging experience to make it easier for you to get your extensions running just the way you’d expect. We’ve also enhanced our remote UI features, added a new way to prompt users, and continued to add features to our project query API.\nGet Started with VisualStudio.Extensibility\n\nPlease visit https://aka.ms/VisualStudio.Extensibility for the latest up-to-date docs and installation instructions. We encourage you to report bugs and suggest features via the issue tracker on our GitHub repo, where you can also find extension samples to help you get started.\n \nWhat’s new for VisualStudio.Extensibility?\nDo you want to develop and debug your extensions more quickly and more easily than before? Our 17.10 release adds the following features to help you do just that:\nDebug your extension using our new Diagnostics Explorer\nLeverage XAML Resources in your UI\nLet your extension users pick files or directories\nTrack project changes with an improved query API\n \nDebug your extension using our new Diagnostics Explorer\nWe’ve created a powerful new tool for debugging your extensions called the VisualStudio.Extensibility Diagnostics Explorer, available here in the Visual Studio Marketplace. With it, you’ll be able to see extensions the way that Visual Studio sees them to help ensure that you’ve configured yours correctly.\nThis tool, which itself was written as an in-process VisualStudio.Extensibility extension, can help you answer questions like “why isn’t my command showing up where I expect it to be in the IDE?” or “why isn’t my extension being activated when I expect it to be?”\nInspect configuration\nVisualStudio.Extensibility has already made it easier for you to configure your extensions by eliminating the need for you to manually maintain separate metadata files. Now, we’re building on that with the Diagnostics Explorer, which lets you see exactly which extensions and components were discovered by Visual Studio, along with the configuration of each discovered item.\nFor example, if you weren’t seeing your command in the IDE, you could use the Command tab Diagnostics Explorer to view any commands that have been contributed to Visual Studio. If it’s not present in the list, that’s a hint to double check your configuration to make sure it gets discovered. If it’s present, but not enabled or visible, you may want to check your activation constraints. And if it’s marked as enabled and visible, you could use the dropdown menu to view command placements to make sure you’ve placed it correctly.\n\nUsing the Commands tab, you can inspect commands, command sets, groups, menus and toolbars, command placements, and dynamic command anchors. Other tabs let you inspect components for other feature areas including tool windows, document types, text views, and more. As we add features in future releases, you’ll be able to inspect any new components alongside these in the Diagnostics Explorer.\nView live event log\nWe know that extension developers like you sometimes develop extensions that may need to handle events throughout the IDE, such as a command being executed, a tool window being opened, or a TextView being created, so we’ve added a live event viewer to enable you to observe these events and their properties in real time:\n\nCreate better activation constraints\nThe Activation Constraints tab in the Diagnostics Explorer gives you the current state for each of the values available to you when creating an activation constraint. Using this tab, you can get the IDE into the state that you want to use for your activation (such as building a project or opening a markdown file), and then you can inspect the values for each of the available expressions to help you create your constraint.\n\nFor example, suppose you wanted a command to be visible only if there’s a C# file open in the editor. With the Diagnostics Explorer, you could open a C# file and use the Activation Constraints tab to help you to determine which of the expressions you’ll need to craft your constraint:\nEnabledWhen = ActivationConstraint.ClientContext(ClientContextKey.Shell.ActiveEditorContentType, \"CSharp\").\r\n\n \nLeverage XAML Resources in your UI\nXAML resources accelerate your UI development by letting you define objects like colors, brushes, or styles that you can leverage throughout your project. With this release of VisualStudio.Extensibility, we’re adding support for XAML resources to help you develop great UIs for your extensions!\nConsistent with our other remote UI features such as UI controls, you’ll define any XAML files with ResourceDictionaries as embedded resources in your .csproj file:\n<ItemGroup>\r\n    <EmbeddedResource Include=\"\\XamlResources.*xaml\" />\r\n    <Page Remove=\"XamlResources.*xaml\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n\nOnce defined, it’s easy to include your resources in other components so that they can be referenced in your XAML throughout your project:\nResourceDictionaries.AddEmbeddedResource(\"XamlResources.xaml\")\r\n\nYou can even localize your resources: see the Modal Dialog sample for more information and let us know what you think!\n \nLet your extension users pick files or directories\nBuilding on our previous support for user prompts and custom dialogs, we’ve added the ability to display file and directory picker prompts from your extensions. For example, you can use the ShowOpenFileDialogAsync() method to prompt users to select a single file to open:\nVisualStudioExtensibility.Shell().ShowOpenFileDialogAsync(options, cancellationToken);\r\n\nUsing the new APIs, you can prompt users to:\nSelect a single file to open\nSelect one or more files to open\nSelect a single file to Save As\nSelect a directory to open\nAs always, if there are other types of user prompts that are important for your extensions, please let us know through our Issues Tracker.\n \nTrack project changes with an improved query API\nOur 17.10 release adds three new features to the project query API.\nTrack changes to query results\nThe TrackUpdatesAsync() method can be used in your project system queries to create an IObserver object to track changes to the state of the projects or solutions in your query. For example, if you want to track when updates made to the files in a project, you could use:\nvar query = await myProject\r\n    .Files\r\n    .With(f => f.FileName)\r\n    .TrackUpdatesAsync(new TrackerObserver(), CancellationToken.None);\r\n\nIn this example, the TrackerObserver implements IObserver<IQueryTrackUpdates<IFileSnapshot>>, so you can use your own custom logic to handle the update events.\nQuery project rules\nEach project in the project query API now contains a RulesResults attribute, which includes a rule name and a list of items. You can access these rules by calling RuleResultsByName() for a given configuration.\nvar results = await querySpace\r\n    .Projects\r\n    .With(p => p.Path)\r\n    .With(p => p.ActiveConfigurations\r\n        .With(c => c.RuleResultsByRuleName(\"CompilerCommandLineArgs\")\r\n            .With(r => r.RuleName)\r\n            .With(r => r.Items\r\n                .With(i => i.Name))))\r\n        .ExecuteQueryAsync();\r\n\nSkip results in a query\nWe’ve added the Skip() method to enable you to skip results in your query.\nvar projects = await queryableSpace.Projects\r\n    .With(proj => proj.Name)\r\n    .Skip(1)\r\n    .ExecuteQueryAsync();\r\n\nHere, the first project is skipped, and the remaining projects are returned.\n \nWe can’t do this without you!\nWe need your help as we continue to develop VisualStudio.Extensibility! Please try out this preview release and let us know what you think. Check out the docs, browse the code samples, and build your first extension. You can send feedback, report issues, or request features through our issue tracker.\nYou can also find information about breaking changes and known issues at our VisualStudio.Extensibility GitHub repo.\nWe’re prioritizing the features that our extenders ask for, so please give VisualStudio.Extensibility a try and share your thoughts with us!\nThe post VisualStudio.Extensibility 17.10: Debug your extensions with the Diagnostics Explorer appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

BS2B는 오랜시간 음악이나 영상을 볼 때 청력의 피로도를 줄여주는 장점도 있다고 한다. 그럼에도 불구하고 BS2B가 모든 사람에게 좋은 것은 아니므로 설정해보고 별로라면 끄면 그만이다.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" width=\"100%\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ZShYf/btsHLq21Xbp/Ee899HZPFw3TCxlr9HPTMK/img.png\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ZShYf/btsHLq21Xbp/Ee899HZPFw3TCxlr9HPTMK/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&amp;fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FZShYf%2FbtsHLq21Xbp%2FEe899HZPFw3TCxlr9HPTMK%2Fimg.png\" width=\"100%\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\"/></span></figure>\n</p>\n<p>BS2B 설정은 가장 많이 쓰이는 C.Moy를 사용하면 700Hz의 6.0dB로 설정된다. 각 설정을 만지면 미세하게 음향이 두상 가운데보다는 약간 앞쪽으로 치우치거나 공간감이 생기게 된다.</p>\n<h2>바이노럴(Binaural)에 대해</h2>\n<p>바이노럴(Binaural)에 대해서는 약간 설명이 필요하므로 첨언을 한다. 인간은 2개의 귀를 가지고 있어서 소리를 들을때 미세한 시간차가 발생한다. 예를 들어 오른쪽 몇 미터 떨어진 곳에서 소리가 가면 오른쪽 귀에 들어오는 소리와 왼쪽 귀에 들이는 소리가 약 0.0004초 정도 딜레이가 발생한다. 만일 대각선 방향이면 딜레이가 조금 달라지면서 인간은 1시방향, 5시 방향 같은 완전 오른쪽이 아닌 경우에도 공감감을 느끼게 되는 것이다. </p>\n<p>그래서 애초에 녹음할 때 인간의 두상 모양의 양쪽 귀에 마이크를 하나씩 두고 녹음하면 이를 바이노럴이라고 한다. 예를 들어 아래 그림처럼 인간 두상처럼 생겼거나 혹은 ASMR할 때 많이 보이는 3Dio 같은 장치로 녹음하는 것이다. 아래 출처의 글도 같이 보면 좋을 듯 하다.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" width=\"100%\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b5HCpZ/btsHKOJ0sWl/R1P93PoLnwvTjz02UJYIQK/img.jpg\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/b5HCpZ/btsHKOJ0sWl/R1P93PoLnwvTjz02UJYIQK/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&amp;fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fb5HCpZ%2FbtsHKOJ0sWl%2FR1P93PoLnwvTjz02UJYIQK%2Fimg.jpg\" width=\"100%\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\"/></span></figure>\n</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" width=\"100%\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bHAIbA/btsHKdDK16U/vMWa1TZR9MKbS8vbyXJXkk/img.webp\" data-lightbox=\"lightbox\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bHAIbA/btsHKdDK16U/vMWa1TZR9MKbS8vbyXJXkk/img.webp\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&amp;fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbHAIbA%2FbtsHKdDK16U%2FvMWa1TZR9MKbS8vbyXJXkk%2Fimg.webp\" width=\"100%\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\"/></span></figure>\n</p>\n<p>그림 출처 - <a href=\"https://emastered.com/ko/blog/binaural-audio\">https://emastered.com/ko/blog/binaural-audio</a></p>\n<p>하지만 바이노럴로 녹음을 하면 스피커로 음악을 감상하는데 방해가 되므로 대부분의 음원은 스피커 기준인 스테레오로 녹음을 한다고 한다. 문제는 최근의 음악 감상은 헤드폰이나 이어폰으로 더 많이 하므로 현실과 맞지 않는다. 그래서 앞서 플러그인의 BS2B(Bauer Sterophonic-to-Binaural) 기능으로 스테레오 녹음된 음원을 바이노럴로 흉내내는 것이다. 흉내이므로 애초 바이노럴 녹음된 소스처럼 완벽한 공간감이 생기는 것은 아니지만 그래도 없는 것보다는 낫다.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.schezade.co.kr/board/guide/board_view.html?no=293\">참고글 - 바이노럴이 뭐지? 바이노럴과 스테레오의 차이는?

BS2B는 오랜시간 음악이나 영상을 볼 때 청력의 피로도를 줄여주는 장점도 있다고 한다. 그럼에도 불구하고 BS2B가 모든 사람에게 좋은 것은 아니므로 설정해보고 별로라면 끄면 그만이다.\n\n\nBS2B 설정은 가장 많이 쓰이는 C.Moy를 사용하면 700Hz의 6.0dB로 설정된다. 각 설정을 만지면 미세하게 음향이 두상 가운데보다는 약간 앞쪽으로 치우치거나 공간감이 생기게 된다.\n바이노럴(Binaural)에 대해\n바이노럴(Binaural)에 대해서는 약간 설명이 필요하므로 첨언을 한다. 인간은 2개의 귀를 가지고 있어서 소리를 들을때 미세한 시간차가 발생한다. 예를 들어 오른쪽 몇 미터 떨어진 곳에서 소리가 가면 오른쪽 귀에 들어오는 소리와 왼쪽 귀에 들이는 소리가 약 0.0004초 정도 딜레이가 발생한다. 만일 대각선 방향이면 딜레이가 조금 달라지면서 인간은 1시방향, 5시 방향 같은 완전 오른쪽이 아닌 경우에도 공감감을 느끼게 되는 것이다. \n그래서 애초에 녹음할 때 인간의 두상 모양의 양쪽 귀에 마이크를 하나씩 두고 녹음하면 이를 바이노럴이라고 한다. 예를 들어 아래 그림처럼 인간 두상처럼 생겼거나 혹은 ASMR할 때 많이 보이는 3Dio 같은 장치로 녹음하는 것이다. 아래 출처의 글도 같이 보면 좋을 듯 하다.\n\n\n\n\n그림 출처 - https://emastered.com/ko/blog/binaural-audio\n하지만 바이노럴로 녹음을 하면 스피커로 음악을 감상하는데 방해가 되므로 대부분의 음원은 스피커 기준인 스테레오로 녹음을 한다고 한다. 문제는 최근의 음악 감상은 헤드폰이나 이어폰으로 더 많이 하므로 현실과 맞지 않는다. 그래서 앞서 플러그인의 BS2B(Bauer Sterophonic-to-Binaural) 기능으로 스테레오 녹음된 음원을 바이노럴로 흉내내는 것이다. 흉내이므로 애초 바이노럴 녹음된 소스처럼 완벽한 공간감이 생기는 것은 아니지만 그래도 없는 것보다는 낫다.\n참고글 - 바이노럴이 뭐지? 바이노럴과 스테레오의 차이는? (MD_내귀에공연장치)\nhttps://www.schezade.co.kr/board/guide/board_view.html?no=293\n참고영상 - 심리음향? 음향에 심리적인 요소가 있어? 싸이코 어쿠스틱? 그게 뭡니까? (김도현 대림대교수)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlUlztwn4Zk\nBS2B 플러그인 설명\nBS2B에 대해서는 아래 링크의 글을 보는 것이 더 좋을 듯 하다. 이 글에는 파라메터값과 자세한 설명이 있다. 음향쪽 전공이 아니라고 하더라도 천천히 읽어보면 어떤 효과인지 자세하게 설명해준다.\nBauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP.\n부드러운 클리핑, 리플레이게인(Replay gain)\n이외에 설정의 오디오 부분에 보면 부드러운 클리핑 기능과 리플레이게인 기능이 있는데, 이를 켜서 좋다는 사람도 있지만 개인적으로는 아무런 차이를 못느꼈다. 그래서 그냥 끄고 사용하는 중이다.(기본값은 모두 disabled 이다) 참고로 아래 그림은 Qt모드의 설정 화면이므로 Gtk모드의 경우와 약간 달라 보일 수 있다.",

NHN Cloud 서비스보안팀 지우중입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n처음 기술 공유 글을 맡은지라 어떤 주제로 작성할까 많은 고민을 하였습니다. 때마침 지난 설 연휴에 고향에 내려갔을 때 친척분이 보이스피싱 피해를 입었다는 소식을 접하였습니다. 그로 인해 자연스레 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에 관심을 가지게 되었고 기술 공유와 더불어 실생활에서 많은 사람들이 보이스피싱 범죄에 노출되지 않기를 바라는 마음으로 이 글을 준비하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 보안을 접하지 않은 분들도 이해하기 쉽도록 풀어 적었기 때문에 다소 글이 길어질 수 있는 점 이해 부탁드립니다. 그럼 시작하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 악성 애플리케이션이란?\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (1).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%201.png)\r\r\n<center><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:80%\">영화 '보이스'와 '스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데'</span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n혹시 '보이스[[1]](https://www.topdaily.kr/articles/76308)'와 '스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데[[2]](https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1007041378)'라는 영화를 보셨나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n안 보신 분들도 계실 것 같아 짧게 줄거리를 설명해 드리자면 일반 사용자의 스마트폰에 악성 애플리케이션을 설치하여 해커는 자신의 PC에서 스마트폰 주인의 취미, 취향, 직업, 동선, 경제력, 인간관계 등 모든 일상을 알아내 피해자의 삶을 붕괴시키는 이야기를 다룬 영화입니다. 이처럼 현재 우리는 스마트폰이라는 손바닥만 한 크기의 기계에 우리의 일거수일투족을 담고 살고 있습니다. 또한 은행 업무, 결제 등 스마트폰 하나만으로 수많은 업무를 처리할 수 있기 때문에 우리에게 스마트폰은 꼭 필요한 존재가 되었습니다. 나의 많은 정보를 작은 기기 하나에 다 담아낼 수 있다는 편리한 도구의 이면에는 그만큼 나의 수많은 개인정보와 금융 정보가 스마트폰 분실 시 모두 노출된다는 매우 치명적이고 위험한 단점이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그림으로 쉽게 표현하자면 아래의 시소 그림[[3]](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)처럼 사용(Usable)이 편하면 그만큼 보안성(Secure)이 떨어질 수밖에 없습니다. 즉, 사용성이 높아지면 보안은 그만큼 취약해질 수 있다고 이해해 주시면 될 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (2).gif](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%202.gif)\r\r\n<center><span class=\"size\" style=\"font-size:80%\">사용성과 보안성의 관계(source: [How Monerujo’s CrAzYpass (crazy secure password scheme) works](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)</span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n\r\r\n# 보이스피싱 애플리케이션이란?\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션은 금융 사기를 목적으로 제작된 것으로 사용자들이 신뢰할 수 있는 기관(금융권, 공공기관)을 사칭하여 개인정보나 금융 정보를 탈취하는 애플리케이션을 말합니다. 보이스피싱에는 일반적으로 검찰, 금융감독원 등 공공기관을 사칭하여 의심 계좌가 발견되었다며 수사를 할 것처럼 겁을 주어 안전한 계좌로 돈을 이체 또는 전달하라는 ‘기관 사칭형’, 저리에 대출을 하기 위해 거래 실적을 만들어야 한다거나 추가 대출을 위해서는 기존 대출금을 모두 상환해야 한다는 ‘대출 사기형’, 그 외에도 아들·딸 등 지인을 사칭하는 방법, ‘재난지원금’, ‘대환대출’ 등을 받기 위해서는 개인정보를 입력하고 관련 비용을 먼저 납부해야 한다는 ‘선비용 수법(advance payment)’ 활용[[4]](https://kostat.go.kr/boardDownload.es?bid=12312&amp;list_no=422196&amp;seq=2) 등 다양한 종류가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n최근 5년간(2018년~2023년 상반기, 전체 금융회사)[[5]](https://www.skypress.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4134) 보이스피싱 피해자 수는 148,760명, 피해 건수 237,859건, 피해 금액 1조 7천499억으로 드러났습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![피해현황.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/uD53CuD574uD604uD669.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이처럼 보이스피싱 범죄자들은 악성 애플리케이션 설치를 유도하여 개인정보 및 금융 정보를 탈취하는 조직적으로 범죄를 저지르고 나날이 수법을 달리하여 보이스피싱은 사회적 문제로 자리 잡았습니다. 따라서 이러한 사회적 문제를 해결하고자 보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 분석하였습니다. 이를 통해 이러한 앱들이 사용자의 신뢰를 얻어 정보를 탈취하는 수법과 보이스피싱의 위험성을 알리고자 이 글을 작성하게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 보이스피싱 애플리케이션 분석\r\r\n\r\r\n## 1 설치\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 본격적으로 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에 대한 분석 과정을 설명하겠습니다. 여기에서는 보이스피싱 범죄에 가장 많이 사용되는 '대출사기형'으로 분석을 해 보겠습니다. 보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 설치하면 아래와 같이 Google Play 프로텍트[[6]](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=ko)에 의해 차단되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (3)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%203e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n스마트폰에 어떤 애플리케이션을 설치할 때 차단되거나 아래와 같이 '출처를 알 수 없는 앱 설치'라는 문구가 발생하는 것 자체가 위험한 애플리케이션이라는 증거입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (4).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%204.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위의 Google Play 프로텍트나 기타 모바일 백신 애플리케이션에서 악성 애플리케이션이 탐지된다면 또 다른 악성 애플리케이션으로 수정하여 빠르게 다시 배포합니다. 이렇게 새로운 악성 애플리케이션을 배포하게 된다면 Google Play 프로텍트나, 기존의 악성 애플리케이션 탐지 솔루션에서는 빠르게 탐지하지 못할 수 있습니다. 따라서 Google Play 프로텍트, 모바일 전용 백신 등에서 차단 및 알람 문구를 보신다면 이 경우는 꼭 한번 다시 확인하시고 설치해 주시기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n하지만 저는 분석을 진행해야 하므로 Google Play 프로텍트 설정을 해제한 다음 단말기(스마트폰)에 설치해 봤습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (5)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%205e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n## 2 분석 탐지 우회\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 분석하는 도중 원활하게 분석하지 못하도록 방해하는 행위가 발견되었습니다. 방해하는 행위는 어떤 것이 있었는지, 또 어떻게 우회하고 분석을 진행했는지에 대해 설명하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nGoogle Play 프로텍트를 해제한 후 설치를 진행하면 '모바일 신청서'라는 악성 애플리케이션이 설치됩니다. 애플리케이션 아이콘도 'A 금융'으로 되어 있어 겉으로 보기에는 정상적인 애플리케이션으로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (6)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%206e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n분석 환경은 보이스 피싱 애플리케이션의 인앱(In-App) 활동을 분석하기 위해 루팅(안드로이드)[7](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/루팅_(안드로이드))된 단말기에 설치하였으며 C\\&C 서버[\\[8\\]](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%26C_(악성_소프트웨어))와의 통신도 분석하기 위해 웹 프락시 도구인 Fiddler[\\[9\\]](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)와 Burp Suite[[10]](https://portswigger.net/burp)를 사용하였습니다. 아래는 웹 프락시[[11]](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9D%EC%8B%9C_%EC%84%9C%EB%B2%84)를 사용하기 위해 Android 설정에서 프락시의 IP와 Port 번호를 설정해 주는 과정입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (7)(8).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2078.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위의 그림처럼 프락시를 설정해 준다면 오른쪽 그림처럼 Android에서 발생하는 모든 네트워크 패킷을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 분석 환경을 설정해 주고 루팅된 단말기에서 실행을 해 보니 바로 종료되는 현상이 발생하였습니다. Logcat으로 분석한 결과 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity에서 onDestroyed가 발생하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (9).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%209.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 onDestroyed가 발생한 원인을 찾기 위해 Android 애플리케이션 디컴파일 도구인 Jadx[[12]](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) 또는 JEB[[13]](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/)를 통해 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity를 검색하였지만 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity가 존재하지 않았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (10).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2010.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이처럼 디컴파일 도구로 특정 Activity, Class, Method, String 등의 값을 검색하였을 때 나오지 않는다면 크게 2가지로 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n1. 암호화된 DEX 파일 사용\r\r\n2. Dynamic Loading(동적 로딩) 사용\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 위의 2가지 중 어떤 기법을 사용하는지 분석하기 위해 애플리케이션의 시작점인 com.tkzCRw.ljYflr.apeuEe.wgrlYZrkff에서 분석을 진행하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (11).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2011.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 시작점인 com.tkzCRw.ljYflr.apeuEe.wgrlYZrkff 클래스의 attachBaseContext 메서드를 살펴보면 unZip이라는 메서드가 존재합니다.\r\r\n아래의 코드는 unZip 메서드 코드 중 일부인데 코드를 해석해 보면 classes.dex가 아니고 파일 확장자가 .dex인 파일이 존재하면 if문 안으로 진입하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (12).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2012.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nDEX 파일은 Android 시스템에서 실행될 수 있는 바이트코드로써 APK 파일 내부에 존재하는 파일입니다. 따라서 위의 코드로 보아 classes.dex가 아닌 dex라는 파일 확장자를 찾는 행위이고 해당 파일을 찾기 위해서는 APK 파일 내부를 살펴볼 필요성이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 APK 파일을 분석한 결과 classes.dex 파일 외 secret-classes.dex 파일이 존재하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (13).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2013.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이름으로 유추할 수 있듯이 secret-classes.dex 파일은 일반적인 DEX 파일의 포맷이 아닌 암호화된 파일이라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (14).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2014.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한, wgrlYZrkff.runFile(zipFile, zipEntry, file, arg15)의 3번째 인자인 file에는 secret-classes.dex가 전달되는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 그 후 runFile 메서드를 보면 최종적으로 loadXFile 메서드를 통해 secret-classes.dex 복호화를 진행합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (15).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2015.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n그 이유는 loadXFile 메서드를 살펴보면 아래 decrypt 메서드가 실행됩니다. 이는 아까 인자로 전달 받았던 secret-classes.dex 파일을 복호화하는 역할을 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (16).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2016.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 메서드명을 난독화하지 않으면 쉽게 해당 메서드 내부 코드를 분석하지 않아도 어떤 행위를 할 것인지 쉽게 유추할 수 있기 때문입니다. 아래의 decrypt 메서드를 살펴보면 아무런 내용이 없고 native라는 키워드가 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (17).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2017.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이는 해당 decrypt 메서드가 Java로 작성된 것이 아니라 dn\\_ssl\\.so 라는 파일에 정의되어 있다는 의미입니다\\. 따라서 decrypt 메서드가 어떤 암호화 알고리즘을 사용하고 어떤 key를 사용하는지 분석하기 위해서는 dn\\_ssl\\.so 파일을 추가로 분석해야 합니다\\. 그렇다면 왜 Java단이 아닌 굳이 Native단에서 수행하는 것일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n개발 측면에서 보자면 Java보다 C/C++로 작성된 Native 코드가 더 빠르다는 장점으로 Native 코드를 사용할 수 있지만 보안 측면에서 생각해 본다면 해당 로직을 숨기고 싶다는 의미로 볼 수 있습니다. 이런 이유로 모바일 보안 솔루션 업체나 악성 애플리케이션에서 숨기고 싶은 중요 로직은 Java단이 아닌 Native 코드단에서 실행하고 처리하는 이유입니다. 즉, 핵심 로직을 숨기고 싶다는 이유가 가장 큽니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nAPK는 Java로 이루어진 파일이기 때문에 Jadx나 JEB로 분석하였다면 Native 코드(.so) 파일을 분석하기 위해서는 IDA라는 프로그램을 이용해서 분석을 진행해야 합니다. 따라서 dn_ssl.so 파일을 IDA로 열어 분석을 진행해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n확인한 결과, 아래의 그림처럼 decrypt 함수가 보입니다. 해당 코드를 분석한 결과 aes/128/ecb 모드를 사용하고 있는 것으로 나타납니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (18).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2018.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한 EVP\\_CIPHER\\_CTX\\_new, EVP\\_aes\\_128\\_ecb, EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 등으로 코드가 작성되어 있는 것으로 보아 해당 암호화 로직은 OpenSSL에서 사용하고 있는 암호화 로직을 사용하는 것으로 파악됩니다\\.\r\r\n\r\r\nOpenSSL에서 사용하는 복호화 로직은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![OpenSSL 복호화 로직_대지 1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/OpenSSL%20uBCF5uD638uD654%20uB85CuC9C1uB300uC9C0%201.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nEVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 함수의 원형은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (18)-1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%20181.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n복호화하기 위해서는 암호화 과정에 사용한 알고리즘, key, iv 값을 알아야 하므로 EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 함수를 살펴보았습니다.

Superuser.apk 애플리케이션은 루팅과 관련된 애플리케이션으로 피싱 애플리케이션에서도 루팅 탐지 로직이 존재한다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (28).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2028.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이로써 피싱 애플리케이션에서도 자신의 악의적인 행위에 대해서 분석하지 못하도록 루팅된 단말기를 확인한다는 것도 알 수 있습니다. 네 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.b 메서드는 /proc/tty/drivers이라는 파일을 열어 수정이 가능한지 파악하는 메서드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (29).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2029.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n/proc/tty/drivers를 수정하기 위해서는 root 권한이 있어야 하며 따라서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.b 메서드도 루팅 탐지 로직으로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n다섯 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f 메서드는 adb_enabled이 설정되어 있는지, 즉 USB 디버깅 모드가 되어 있는지 확인하는 메서드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (30).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2030.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n해당 메서드의 역할은 동적으로 애플리케이션을 분석하기 위해서는 PC와 USB로 연결되어야 하는데 이것을 탐지하기 위해서 사용되는 메서드로 보입니다.\r\r\n다섯 번째 분기문에는 메서드가 2개가 있기 때문에 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.e 메서드를 분석하면 VPN을 사용하고 있는지 탐지하는 로직입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (31).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2031.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한 다섯 번째 분기문에서는 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f와 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.e 두 개의 메서드에서 true가 반환되어야만 분기문이 실행됩니다. 하지만 분석하는 단말기에서는 USB 디버깅은 사용하지만 VPN을 사용하고 있지 않기 때문에 최종적으로 다섯 번째 분기문은 실행되지 않고 다음 분기문으로 넘어가게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n여섯 번째 분기문 안에는 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f 메서드로 USB 디버깅을 사용 중이기 때문에 분기문이 실행됩니다. 분기문이 실행되면서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드가 실행되는데 해당 메서드는 단말기에서 프락시를 사용하고 있는지를 판단하는 로직으로 확인됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (32).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2032.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드에서 true가 반환되기 때문에 애플리케이션이 종료되는 것으로 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (33).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2033.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n그렇다면 악성 애플리케이션은 왜 루팅 탐지와 VPN, Proxy를 탐지하는 걸까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n정답은 간단합니다.\r\r\n자신의 악성 행위를 분석하지 못하게 하기 위해서입니다. 루팅은 양날의 검이라고 생각하면 쉬울 것 같습니다. 공격자의 입장에서는 편하게 공격하기 위해서 루팅을 하기도 하고, 방어하는 입장에서는 악성 행위를 편하게 분석하기 위해서도 루팅을 진행합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그렇다면 Proxy는 왜 탐지하는 걸까요?\r\r\n바로 악성 애플리케이션이 설치된 단말기 내부에 존재하는 민감한 정보를 공격자의 C&C 서버로 보내기 위해서 어쩔 수 없이 통신해야 하는데 프락시를 사용한다면 C&C 서버와 어떤 데이터를 주고받는지까지 알 수 있기 때문에 프락시를 탐지하는 것입니다. 따라서 프락시 탐지 메서드인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드를 변조하여 프락시를 사용해도 애플리케이션이 실행될 수 있게 코드를 다음과 같이 수정하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (34).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2034.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n코드를 수정한 뒤 apktool[[14]](https://apktool.org/)이라는 도구를 이용하여 리패키징을 진행하였습니다. Proxy 탐지를 우회한 APK 파일을 JEB로 디컴파일한 결과 변조가 성공적으로 이루어진 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (35).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2035.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n프락시 탐지 메서드를 우회한 APK를 설치한 결과 Proxy가 설정된 단말기에서도 정상적으로 실행할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 마치며\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션 분석 1편은 여기까지 진행하겠습니다. 다음 분석편에서는 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에서 어떤 데이터를 C&C 서버로 보내는지, 단말기에서는 어떤 것이 이루어지는지, 보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 핵심인 '전화 가로채기'의 원리는 무엇인지에 대한 내용을 공유하려고 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n'전화 가로채기'에 대해 먼저 짧게 설명해 드리자면 피해자가 보이스 피싱 조직원들에게 전화를 받고 확인하기 위해서 금융기관 등에 전화할 때 사용자에게 보이는 화면에서는 금융기관에 전화한 것처럼 보이지만 실제로는 보이스피싱 조직원들에게 연결되게 하는 기법입니다. '전화 가로채기'가 동작하는 방식을 아래 영상을 통해 확인하실 수 있는데요, 이 영상에서는 '엔에이치엔클라우드'라는 금융기관이 있다는 가정하에 보이스피싱 피해자가 확인을 위해 엔에이치엔클라우드 대표 번호로 발신하는 과정을 보여줍니다. 엔에이치엔클라우드 대표 번호로 발신하였음에도 정작 보이스 피싱 조직원에게 전화가 오는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![videoframe_843.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/alpha/2024/techblog/videoframe843.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n>  [영상 바로 가기](https://youtu.be/32bLJJcV4pU)\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼, 2편에서 다시 뵙겠습니다. 긴 글 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n## 참고 문헌\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1] [보이스](https://search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&amp;sm=tab_etc&amp;mra=bkEw&amp;pkid=68&amp;os=11213787&amp;qvt=0&amp;query=%EC%98%81%ED%99%94%20%EB%B3%B4%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4)\r\r\n* [2] [스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데](https://search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&amp;sm=tab_etc&amp;mra=bkEw&amp;pkid=68&amp;os=18904281&amp;qvt=0&amp;query=%EC%98%81%ED%99%94%20%EC%8A%A4%EB%A7%88%ED%8A%B8%ED%8F%B0%EC%9D%84%20%EB%96%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9C%A8%EB%A0%B8%EC%9D%84%20%EB%BF%90%EC%9D%B8%EB%8D%B0)\r\r\n* [3] [Playgrounds are full of useful metaphors.](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)\r\r\n* [4] [[범죄·안전] 보이스피싱 현황, 유형, 추이와 대응관련 시사점](https://kostat.go.kr/boardDownload.es?bid=12312&amp;list_no=422196&amp;seq=2)\r\r\n* [5] [최근 5년간(2018 ~ 2023년 상반기) 보이스피싱 피해금액 1조7천499억원](https://www.skypress.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4134)\r\r\n* [6] [Google Play 프로텍트로 앱을 안전하게 보호하고 데이터를 비공개로 유지하기](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=ko)\r\r\n* [7] [루팅 (안드로이드)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/루팅_(안드로이드))\r\r\n* [8] [C&C (악성 소프트웨어)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%26C_(악성_소프트웨어))\r\r\n* [9] [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)\r\r\n* [10] [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)\r\r\n* [11] [프록시 서버](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9D%EC%8B%9C_%EC%84%9C%EB%B2%84)\r\r\n* [12] [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)\r\r\n* [13] [JEB](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/)\r\r\n* [14] [apktool](https://apktool.org/)",

NHN Cloud 서비스보안팀 지우중입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n처음 기술 공유 글을 맡은지라 어떤 주제로 작성할까 많은 고민을 하였습니다. 때마침 지난 설 연휴에 고향에 내려갔을 때 친척분이 보이스피싱 피해를 입었다는 소식을 접하였습니다. 그로 인해 자연스레 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에 관심을 가지게 되었고 기술 공유와 더불어 실생활에서 많은 사람들이 보이스피싱 범죄에 노출되지 않기를 바라는 마음으로 이 글을 준비하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 보안을 접하지 않은 분들도 이해하기 쉽도록 풀어 적었기 때문에 다소 글이 길어질 수 있는 점 이해 부탁드립니다. 그럼 시작하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 악성 애플리케이션이란?\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (1).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%201.png)\r\r\n영화 '보이스'와 '스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데'\r\r\n\r\r\n혹시 '보이스[[1]](https://www.topdaily.kr/articles/76308)'와 '스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데[[2]](https://news.sbs.co.kr/news/endPage.do?news_id=N1007041378)'라는 영화를 보셨나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n안 보신 분들도 계실 것 같아 짧게 줄거리를 설명해 드리자면 일반 사용자의 스마트폰에 악성 애플리케이션을 설치하여 해커는 자신의 PC에서 스마트폰 주인의 취미, 취향, 직업, 동선, 경제력, 인간관계 등 모든 일상을 알아내 피해자의 삶을 붕괴시키는 이야기를 다룬 영화입니다. 이처럼 현재 우리는 스마트폰이라는 손바닥만 한 크기의 기계에 우리의 일거수일투족을 담고 살고 있습니다. 또한 은행 업무, 결제 등 스마트폰 하나만으로 수많은 업무를 처리할 수 있기 때문에 우리에게 스마트폰은 꼭 필요한 존재가 되었습니다. 나의 많은 정보를 작은 기기 하나에 다 담아낼 수 있다는 편리한 도구의 이면에는 그만큼 나의 수많은 개인정보와 금융 정보가 스마트폰 분실 시 모두 노출된다는 매우 치명적이고 위험한 단점이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그림으로 쉽게 표현하자면 아래의 시소 그림[[3]](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)처럼 사용(Usable)이 편하면 그만큼 보안성(Secure)이 떨어질 수밖에 없습니다. 즉, 사용성이 높아지면 보안은 그만큼 취약해질 수 있다고 이해해 주시면 될 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (2).gif](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%202.gif)\r\r\n사용성과 보안성의 관계(source: [How Monerujo’s CrAzYpass (crazy secure password scheme) works](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n# 보이스피싱 애플리케이션이란?\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션은 금융 사기를 목적으로 제작된 것으로 사용자들이 신뢰할 수 있는 기관(금융권, 공공기관)을 사칭하여 개인정보나 금융 정보를 탈취하는 애플리케이션을 말합니다. 보이스피싱에는 일반적으로 검찰, 금융감독원 등 공공기관을 사칭하여 의심 계좌가 발견되었다며 수사를 할 것처럼 겁을 주어 안전한 계좌로 돈을 이체 또는 전달하라는 ‘기관 사칭형’, 저리에 대출을 하기 위해 거래 실적을 만들어야 한다거나 추가 대출을 위해서는 기존 대출금을 모두 상환해야 한다는 ‘대출 사기형’, 그 외에도 아들·딸 등 지인을 사칭하는 방법, ‘재난지원금’, ‘대환대출’ 등을 받기 위해서는 개인정보를 입력하고 관련 비용을 먼저 납부해야 한다는 ‘선비용 수법(advance payment)’ 활용[[4]](https://kostat.go.kr/boardDownload.es?bid=12312&list_no=422196&seq=2) 등 다양한 종류가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n최근 5년간(2018년~2023년 상반기, 전체 금융회사)[[5]](https://www.skypress.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4134) 보이스피싱 피해자 수는 148,760명, 피해 건수 237,859건, 피해 금액 1조 7천499억으로 드러났습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![피해현황.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/uD53CuD574uD604uD669.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이처럼 보이스피싱 범죄자들은 악성 애플리케이션 설치를 유도하여 개인정보 및 금융 정보를 탈취하는 조직적으로 범죄를 저지르고 나날이 수법을 달리하여 보이스피싱은 사회적 문제로 자리 잡았습니다. 따라서 이러한 사회적 문제를 해결하고자 보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 분석하였습니다. 이를 통해 이러한 앱들이 사용자의 신뢰를 얻어 정보를 탈취하는 수법과 보이스피싱의 위험성을 알리고자 이 글을 작성하게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 보이스피싱 애플리케이션 분석\r\r\n\r\r\n## 1 설치\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 본격적으로 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에 대한 분석 과정을 설명하겠습니다. 여기에서는 보이스피싱 범죄에 가장 많이 사용되는 '대출사기형'으로 분석을 해 보겠습니다. 보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 설치하면 아래와 같이 Google Play 프로텍트[[6]](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=ko)에 의해 차단되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (3)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%203e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n스마트폰에 어떤 애플리케이션을 설치할 때 차단되거나 아래와 같이 '출처를 알 수 없는 앱 설치'라는 문구가 발생하는 것 자체가 위험한 애플리케이션이라는 증거입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (4).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%204.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위의 Google Play 프로텍트나 기타 모바일 백신 애플리케이션에서 악성 애플리케이션이 탐지된다면 또 다른 악성 애플리케이션으로 수정하여 빠르게 다시 배포합니다. 이렇게 새로운 악성 애플리케이션을 배포하게 된다면 Google Play 프로텍트나, 기존의 악성 애플리케이션 탐지 솔루션에서는 빠르게 탐지하지 못할 수 있습니다. 따라서 Google Play 프로텍트, 모바일 전용 백신 등에서 차단 및 알람 문구를 보신다면 이 경우는 꼭 한번 다시 확인하시고 설치해 주시기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n하지만 저는 분석을 진행해야 하므로 Google Play 프로텍트 설정을 해제한 다음 단말기(스마트폰)에 설치해 봤습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (5)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%205e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n## 2 분석 탐지 우회\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션을 분석하는 도중 원활하게 분석하지 못하도록 방해하는 행위가 발견되었습니다. 방해하는 행위는 어떤 것이 있었는지, 또 어떻게 우회하고 분석을 진행했는지에 대해 설명하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nGoogle Play 프로텍트를 해제한 후 설치를 진행하면 '모바일 신청서'라는 악성 애플리케이션이 설치됩니다. 애플리케이션 아이콘도 'A 금융'으로 되어 있어 겉으로 보기에는 정상적인 애플리케이션으로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (6)_e.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%206e.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n분석 환경은 보이스 피싱 애플리케이션의 인앱(In-App) 활동을 분석하기 위해 루팅(안드로이드)[7](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/루팅_(안드로이드))된 단말기에 설치하였으며 C\\&C 서버[\\[8\\]](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%26C_(악성_소프트웨어))와의 통신도 분석하기 위해 웹 프락시 도구인 Fiddler[\\[9\\]](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)와 Burp Suite[[10]](https://portswigger.net/burp)를 사용하였습니다. 아래는 웹 프락시[[11]](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9D%EC%8B%9C_%EC%84%9C%EB%B2%84)를 사용하기 위해 Android 설정에서 프락시의 IP와 Port 번호를 설정해 주는 과정입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (7)(8).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2078.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위의 그림처럼 프락시를 설정해 준다면 오른쪽 그림처럼 Android에서 발생하는 모든 네트워크 패킷을 모니터링할 수 있습니다. 기본적으로 분석 환경을 설정해 주고 루팅된 단말기에서 실행을 해 보니 바로 종료되는 현상이 발생하였습니다.

Dynamic Loading(동적 로딩) 사용\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 위의 2가지 중 어떤 기법을 사용하는지 분석하기 위해 애플리케이션의 시작점인 com.tkzCRw.ljYflr.apeuEe.wgrlYZrkff에서 분석을 진행하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (11).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2011.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 시작점인 com.tkzCRw.ljYflr.apeuEe.wgrlYZrkff 클래스의 attachBaseContext 메서드를 살펴보면 unZip이라는 메서드가 존재합니다.\r\r\n아래의 코드는 unZip 메서드 코드 중 일부인데 코드를 해석해 보면 classes.dex가 아니고 파일 확장자가 .dex인 파일이 존재하면 if문 안으로 진입하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (12).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2012.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nDEX 파일은 Android 시스템에서 실행될 수 있는 바이트코드로써 APK 파일 내부에 존재하는 파일입니다. 따라서 위의 코드로 보아 classes.dex가 아닌 dex라는 파일 확장자를 찾는 행위이고 해당 파일을 찾기 위해서는 APK 파일 내부를 살펴볼 필요성이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 APK 파일을 분석한 결과 classes.dex 파일 외 secret-classes.dex 파일이 존재하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (13).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2013.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이름으로 유추할 수 있듯이 secret-classes.dex 파일은 일반적인 DEX 파일의 포맷이 아닌 암호화된 파일이라는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (14).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2014.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한, wgrlYZrkff.runFile(zipFile, zipEntry, file, arg15)의 3번째 인자인 file에는 secret-classes.dex가 전달되는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 그 후 runFile 메서드를 보면 최종적으로 loadXFile 메서드를 통해 secret-classes.dex 복호화를 진행합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (15).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2015.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n그 이유는 loadXFile 메서드를 살펴보면 아래 decrypt 메서드가 실행됩니다. 이는 아까 인자로 전달 받았던 secret-classes.dex 파일을 복호화하는 역할을 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (16).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2016.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 메서드명을 난독화하지 않으면 쉽게 해당 메서드 내부 코드를 분석하지 않아도 어떤 행위를 할 것인지 쉽게 유추할 수 있기 때문입니다. 아래의 decrypt 메서드를 살펴보면 아무런 내용이 없고 native라는 키워드가 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (17).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2017.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이는 해당 decrypt 메서드가 Java로 작성된 것이 아니라 dn\\_ssl\\.so 라는 파일에 정의되어 있다는 의미입니다\\. 따라서 decrypt 메서드가 어떤 암호화 알고리즘을 사용하고 어떤 key를 사용하는지 분석하기 위해서는 dn\\_ssl\\.so 파일을 추가로 분석해야 합니다\\. 그렇다면 왜 Java단이 아닌 굳이 Native단에서 수행하는 것일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n개발 측면에서 보자면 Java보다 C/C++로 작성된 Native 코드가 더 빠르다는 장점으로 Native 코드를 사용할 수 있지만 보안 측면에서 생각해 본다면 해당 로직을 숨기고 싶다는 의미로 볼 수 있습니다. 이런 이유로 모바일 보안 솔루션 업체나 악성 애플리케이션에서 숨기고 싶은 중요 로직은 Java단이 아닌 Native 코드단에서 실행하고 처리하는 이유입니다. 즉, 핵심 로직을 숨기고 싶다는 이유가 가장 큽니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nAPK는 Java로 이루어진 파일이기 때문에 Jadx나 JEB로 분석하였다면 Native 코드(.so) 파일을 분석하기 위해서는 IDA라는 프로그램을 이용해서 분석을 진행해야 합니다. 따라서 dn_ssl.so 파일을 IDA로 열어 분석을 진행해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n확인한 결과, 아래의 그림처럼 decrypt 함수가 보입니다. 해당 코드를 분석한 결과 aes/128/ecb 모드를 사용하고 있는 것으로 나타납니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (18).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2018.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한 EVP\\_CIPHER\\_CTX\\_new, EVP\\_aes\\_128\\_ecb, EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 등으로 코드가 작성되어 있는 것으로 보아 해당 암호화 로직은 OpenSSL에서 사용하고 있는 암호화 로직을 사용하는 것으로 파악됩니다\\.\r\r\n\r\r\nOpenSSL에서 사용하는 복호화 로직은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![OpenSSL 복호화 로직_대지 1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/OpenSSL%20uBCF5uD638uD654%20uB85CuC9C1uB300uC9C0%201.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nEVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 함수의 원형은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (18)-1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%20181.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n복호화하기 위해서는 암호화 과정에 사용한 알고리즘, key, iv 값을 알아야 하므로 EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 함수를 살펴보았습니다. EVP\\_DecryptInit\\_ex 함수에서 off\\_19A004가 암호화 key을 의미하고, 0은 iv 값을 의미합니다. 따라서 off\\_19A004로 가보면 key가 dbcdcfghijklmaop로 하드 코딩된 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (19).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2019.png)\r\r\n![Untitled (20).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2020.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n암호화 알고리즘과 key 값, iv 값을 알았으니 암호화된 secret-classes.dex 파일을 복호화할 경우 아래처럼 원본의 dex 파일을 획득할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (21).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2021.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n원래의 목적인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity를 분석하기 위해서 복호화 된 원본의 secret-classes.dex 파일을 악성 APK 파일에 추가한 후 다시 리패키징하여 Jadx나 JEB 같은 디컴파일로 분석을 진행하였습니다. 복호화된 Dex 파일이 포함된 APK 파일을 디컴파일한 뒤 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity 검색하면 아래와 같이 코드를 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (22).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2022.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게까지 숨긴 이유를 생각해 보면 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity는 악성 행위를 하는 코드가 존재할 것으로 파악됩니다. com.fzbXad.kqfSua.MainActivity.onCreate 함수를 분석하면 super.onCreate 메서드로 부모 클래스인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.base.BaseActivity의 onCreteat 함수를 제일 먼저 호출합니다. 부모 클래스인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.base.BaseActivity의 onCreteat 메서드를 분석한 결과 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.j 메서드의 return 값이 true이면 finish() 메서드가 실행되기 때문에 Destroy() 메서드가 호출되었다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (23).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2023.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.j 메서드의 return 값을 알기 위해 해당 메서드를 분석하였습니다. com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.j 메서드는 6개의 if문으로 구성되어 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (24).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2024.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n각 분기문의 return 값이 true인 것으로 보아 각 분기에 존재하는 메서드에 대한 분석을 진행해야만 악성 애플리케이션이 종료되는 정확한 이유를 알 수 있기 때문에 모든 분기문에 대해서 분석을 시작하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n첫 번째 분기의 메서드 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.h는 애플리케이션이 설치된 단말기의 언어 설정이 한국어인지를 확인하는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (25).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2025.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 해당 보이스피싱 애플리케이션은 한국을 타깃으로 한 악성 애플리케이션인 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n두 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.d 메서드는 Android 애플리케이션에서 디바이스가 테스트용 키(testkeys)를 사용하고 있는지 확인하는 메서드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (26).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2026.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n일반적으로 단말기가 루팅되었거나 테스트용으로 사용되는 경우를 탐지할 때 사용하는 방법입니다. 분석하는 단말기도 루팅이 되어 있기 때문에 getprop | grep test-keys 명령어로 Build.TAGS에 test-keys가 있는지를 확인한 결과 존재하지 않기 때문에 애플리케이션이 종료되지 않고 다음 분기로 넘어간다는 것을 알 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (27).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2027.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n세 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.c 메서드에서는 /system/app/ 경로에 Superuser.apk 파일이 존재하는지 확인하는 메서드입니다. Superuser.apk 애플리케이션은 루팅과 관련된 애플리케이션으로 피싱 애플리케이션에서도 루팅 탐지 로직이 존재한다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (28).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2028.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이로써 피싱 애플리케이션에서도 자신의 악의적인 행위에 대해서 분석하지 못하도록 루팅된 단말기를 확인한다는 것도 알 수 있습니다. 네 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.b 메서드는 /proc/tty/drivers이라는 파일을 열어 수정이 가능한지 파악하는 메서드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (29).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2029.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n/proc/tty/drivers를 수정하기 위해서는 root 권한이 있어야 하며 따라서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.b 메서드도 루팅 탐지 로직으로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n다섯 번째 분기문인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f 메서드는 adb_enabled이 설정되어 있는지, 즉 USB 디버깅 모드가 되어 있는지 확인하는 메서드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (30).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2030.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n해당 메서드의 역할은 동적으로 애플리케이션을 분석하기 위해서는 PC와 USB로 연결되어야 하는데 이것을 탐지하기 위해서 사용되는 메서드로 보입니다.\r\r\n다섯 번째 분기문에는 메서드가 2개가 있기 때문에 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.e 메서드를 분석하면 VPN을 사용하고 있는지 탐지하는 로직입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (31).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2031.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n또한 다섯 번째 분기문에서는 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f와 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.e 두 개의 메서드에서 true가 반환되어야만 분기문이 실행됩니다. 하지만 분석하는 단말기에서는 USB 디버깅은 사용하지만 VPN을 사용하고 있지 않기 때문에 최종적으로 다섯 번째 분기문은 실행되지 않고 다음 분기문으로 넘어가게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n여섯 번째 분기문 안에는 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.f 메서드로 USB 디버깅을 사용 중이기 때문에 분기문이 실행됩니다. 분기문이 실행되면서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드가 실행되는데 해당 메서드는 단말기에서 프락시를 사용하고 있는지를 판단하는 로직으로 확인됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (32).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2032.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n따라서 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드에서 true가 반환되기 때문에 애플리케이션이 종료되는 것으로 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (33).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2033.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n그렇다면 악성 애플리케이션은 왜 루팅 탐지와 VPN, Proxy를 탐지하는 걸까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n정답은 간단합니다.\r\r\n자신의 악성 행위를 분석하지 못하게 하기 위해서입니다. 루팅은 양날의 검이라고 생각하면 쉬울 것 같습니다. 공격자의 입장에서는 편하게 공격하기 위해서 루팅을 하기도 하고, 방어하는 입장에서는 악성 행위를 편하게 분석하기 위해서도 루팅을 진행합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그렇다면 Proxy는 왜 탐지하는 걸까요?\r\r\n바로 악성 애플리케이션이 설치된 단말기 내부에 존재하는 민감한 정보를 공격자의 C&C 서버로 보내기 위해서 어쩔 수 없이 통신해야 하는데 프락시를 사용한다면 C&C 서버와 어떤 데이터를 주고받는지까지 알 수 있기 때문에 프락시를 탐지하는 것입니다. 따라서 프락시 탐지 메서드인 com.fzbXad.kqfSua.a.c.n 메서드를 변조하여 프락시를 사용해도 애플리케이션이 실행될 수 있게 코드를 다음과 같이 수정하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (34).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2034.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n코드를 수정한 뒤 apktool[[14]](https://apktool.org/)이라는 도구를 이용하여 리패키징을 진행하였습니다. Proxy 탐지를 우회한 APK 파일을 JEB로 디컴파일한 결과 변조가 성공적으로 이루어진 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Untitled (35).png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/Untitled%2035.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n프락시 탐지 메서드를 우회한 APK를 설치한 결과 Proxy가 설정된 단말기에서도 정상적으로 실행할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# 마치며\r\r\n\r\r\n보이스피싱 애플리케이션 분석 1편은 여기까지 진행하겠습니다. 다음 분석편에서는 보이스피싱 애플리케이션에서 어떤 데이터를 C&C 서버로 보내는지, 단말기에서는 어떤 것이 이루어지는지, 보이스피싱 애플리케이션의 핵심인 '전화 가로채기'의 원리는 무엇인지에 대한 내용을 공유하려고 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n'전화 가로채기'에 대해 먼저 짧게 설명해 드리자면 피해자가 보이스 피싱 조직원들에게 전화를 받고 확인하기 위해서 금융기관 등에 전화할 때 사용자에게 보이는 화면에서는 금융기관에 전화한 것처럼 보이지만 실제로는 보이스피싱 조직원들에게 연결되게 하는 기법입니다. '전화 가로채기'가 동작하는 방식을 아래 영상을 통해 확인하실 수 있는데요, 이 영상에서는 '엔에이치엔클라우드'라는 금융기관이 있다는 가정하에 보이스피싱 피해자가 확인을 위해 엔에이치엔클라우드 대표 번호로 발신하는 과정을 보여줍니다. 엔에이치엔클라우드 대표 번호로 발신하였음에도 정작 보이스 피싱 조직원에게 전화가 오는 모습을 볼 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![videoframe_843.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/alpha/2024/techblog/videoframe843.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n>  [영상 바로 가기](https://youtu.be/32bLJJcV4pU)\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼, 2편에서 다시 뵙겠습니다. 긴 글 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n## 참고 문헌\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1] [보이스](https://search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm=tab_etc&mra=bkEw&pkid=68&os=11213787&qvt=0&query=%EC%98%81%ED%99%94%20%EB%B3%B4%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4)\r\r\n* [2] [스마트폰을 떨어뜨렸을 뿐인데](https://search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm=tab_etc&mra=bkEw&pkid=68&os=18904281&qvt=0&query=%EC%98%81%ED%99%94%20%EC%8A%A4%EB%A7%88%ED%8A%B8%ED%8F%B0%EC%9D%84%20%EB%96%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9C%A8%EB%A0%B8%EC%9D%84%20%EB%BF%90%EC%9D%B8%EB%8D%B0)\r\r\n* [3] [Playgrounds are full of useful metaphors.](https://anhdres.medium.com/how-monerujos-crazypass-crazy-secure-password-scheme-works-dc4f99a99ff0)\r\r\n* [4] [[범죄·안전] 보이스피싱 현황, 유형, 추이와 대응관련 시사점](https://kostat.go.kr/boardDownload.es?bid=12312&list_no=422196&seq=2)\r\r\n* [5] [최근 5년간(2018 ~ 2023년 상반기) 보이스피싱 피해금액 1조7천499억원](https://www.skypress.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4134)\r\r\n* [6] [Google Play 프로텍트로 앱을 안전하게 보호하고 데이터를 비공개로 유지하기](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=ko)\r\r\n* [7] [루팅 (안드로이드)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/루팅_(안드로이드))\r\r\n* [8] [C&C (악성 소프트웨어)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%26C_(악성_소프트웨어))\r\r\n* [9] [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)\r\r\n* [10] [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp)\r\r\n* [11] [프록시 서버](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9D%EC%8B%9C_%EC%84%9C%EB%B2%84)\r\r\n* [12] [Jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)\r\r\n* [13] [JEB](https://www.pnfsoftware.com/)\r\r\n* [14] [apktool](https://apktool.org/)",

AI가 모든 걸 파괴하고 있고, 모든 걸 먹어 치우고 있고, 모든 걸 창작하고 있지만, 감동, 즐거움, 그리고 통찰력을 줄 수 있는 창작물은 사람만이 할 수 있고, 사람만이 해야 한다는 생각을 요샌 더욱더 많이 한다. 나도 그냥 기계를 사용하면 15분 만에 블로그 포스팅 하나를 뚝딱 만들 순 있을 것 같은데, 이렇게 해서 작성한 글을 읽어보면 뭔가 이상하고 맞지 않다는 느낌이 든다. 남들이 읽었을 땐, 이걸 배기홍이 쓴 건지, 기계가 쓴 건지, 구분을 못 할 수도 있지만, 나는 그 차이를 아주 명확하게 안다. 그리고 이건 나에겐 매우 중요하다.\n10년 뒤에 이 글을 다시 읽어보면, 기계가 맞았는지, 사람이 맞았는지, 조금 더 명확하게 판단할 수 있을 것이다.",

있겠지만 결혼식 비용이 오르다 보니 축의금 또한 오르고 있다. 진심을 다해 축하하지만 그래도 축의금의 무게를 외면하기는 어려운 법.\n사정이 이렇다보니 결혼식에 참여할 경우와 그렇지 않은 경우로 금액에 차등을 두는 문화도 생겨났다. 한 설문조사*에 따르면 축의금만 보내는 경우는 5만 원이 52.8%, 결혼식에 참석하는 경우는 10만 원을 내는 경우가 67.4%로 가장 많았다고 한다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*신한은행

것일까?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}조선시대 위시리스트는 ‘이것'\n우리나라도 원래는 선물을 주고받는 문화였다. 그것도 생각보다 호사스럽고 복잡다단하게 말이다. 조선 중기의 문신 유희춘이 남긴 『미암일기』를 보면 양반들끼리 어떤 선물을 주고받았는지 자세히 알 수 있다.\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}가장 흔했던 것은 술과 과일, 그리고 김이었다. 곶감도 자주 선물했다. 맛있는 것을 공유하는 차원의 선물이 일반적이었고, 지금과 마찬가지로 미식의 대표주자는 술이나 과일 혹은 별미류였다. 특별한 선물로는 전복이나 숭어, 오징어, 가물치 같은 수산물이었다. 숭어와 농어는 말려서 선물로 주었다고 한다.\n유희춘의 경우는 활동했던 곳, 인연을 맺었던 사람들이 강진, 영광, 진도, 무안 등 해안지역 사람들이 많았기 때문에 수산물을 얻고 나누기에 용이했을 것이다. 이런 점을 고려하더라도 수산물이 지금보다 구하기 어려웠다는 점, 운반이나 보관도 훨씬 까다로웠을 것을 생각한다면 당시 수산물은 홍삼세트나 갈비세트처럼 귀한 선물이었을 것이다.\n축의금의 시작은 율곡 이이?\n.css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;}경사(慶事)에 기증할 때는 예(禮)의 크고 작은 데 따라 예물의 다소(多少)를 정하는데, 많으면 무명 다섯 필과 쌀 열 말, 그 다음은 무명 세 필과 쌀 다섯 말이며, 적으면 무명 한 필과 쌀 세　말로 한다. 대과(大科) 급제와 같은 경우가 대례(大禮)이고 생원⋅진사가 그 다음이며, 그 나머지 아들의 관례(冠禮)나 처음 하는 벼슬, 품계가 오르는 따위가 소례(小禮)이다. 혼례에는 무명 세 필과 쌀 다섯 말을 부조한다.\n-『율곡전서』권16, 잡저, 해주향약 중\n위의 글은 율곡 이이가 쓴 『해주향약』에 나오는 내용이다. 향약은 마을 사람들이 지켜야 할 유교 윤리를 말한다. 율곡 이이는 유교적인 가치관을 일반 백성들도 쉽게 이해할 수 있게 정리했고, 마을 공동체에서 그 가치를 함께 지키며 살 수 있도록 글을 썼다. 해주향약은 황해도 해주 지역에서 유교적 이상을 실천하고자 했던 이이의 노력이었다.\n이 글에서 율곡 이이는 축의금에 대한 입장을 명확히 하고 있다. ‘혼례에는 무명 세 필, 쌀 다섯 말' 정도를 하면 된다는 것이 이이의 지론이었다. 앞서 이야기했듯 조선 시대에는 서로 간에 많은 현물을 주고받았다. 그러다 보니 선물이 뇌물로 둔갑하는 일이 흔했다. 누군가의 결혼을 축하하며 과도한 선물을 보내서 환심을 사는 것. 이이는 이를 경계했고 적당한 수준에서 축하할 것을 권고한 것이다.\n흥미로운 점은 당시 무명과 쌀이 화폐로 쓰였다는 점이다. 조선은 18세기 이전까지 화폐 경제가 활발하지 않았고, 옷감으로 쓰는 무명과 식생활의 기본인 쌀을 가지고 필요한 물품을 구입했다. 이 금액의 가치를 오늘날 기준으로 환산하기란 극히 어렵다. \n다만, 조선 전기 토질이 나쁜 토지에서 내는 세금의 양이 쌀 4~6말 정도였고, 당시 최고 부자들이 수만필의 무명을 가지고 있었다는 기록을 통해 가늠할 뿐이다. 아마도 오늘날 5만 원에서 10만 원 사이를 두고 느끼는 우리의 감정과 비슷한 수준일 듯 하다.\n이런 부분을 고려한다면 이이는 축의금의 원조라고 부를 수도 있다. 화려하고 비싼 선물을 통해 재력을 과시하는 것보다는 적당한 금액을 나눔으로 공동체의 화목을 도모하자는 발상이었으니 말이다.\n농촌은 선물, 도시는 현금\n조선 말기 그리고 일제강점기 들어 선물 대신 결혼 축의금 문화가 시작된다. 화폐 경제가 성장하고, 도시화 산업화가 조금씩 진척되었기 때문이다.  그렇다고 선물을 주고받는 문화가 쉽게 사라지지는 않았다. 특히 농촌에서는 1960년대만 하더라도 마을 잔치가 빈번했고 결혼식에는 다양한 형태의 선물이 전해졌다.\n경북 영양군에 있는 감천마을의 경우 ‘몸부조’라는 문화가 있었다. 잔치 음식을 만들거나 밥상이나 술상을 차릴 때 함께 도와주며 선물을 대신하는 문화였다. 젊은 남성들은 가축을 잡고, 나이가 많은 여성들은 음식 맛을 내는 식이었다. \n1970년대까지만 하더라도 농촌에서 결혼식을 하면 쌀밥을 대접하지 못해서 국수를 대접하기도 했고 술이나 감주 같이 마실 거리를 손님들이 준비하기도 했다. 양말, 내의, 런닝, 셔츠 같이 소박하지만 마음을 담은 선물도 전했다. 참으로 어려웠던 시절의 정성이었다.\n하지만 도시는 달랐다. 도시에서는 빠르게 축의금 문화가 정착했고 선물은 사회적 소수, 가진 자들의 문화로 바뀌어갔다. 한국의 혼인 문화는 결혼에 드는 물품과 비용인 ‘혼수’가 핵심이었다. 신부와 신랑이 결혼식 전 과정에서 엄청난 혼수를 준비했다. 신랑신부의 화려한 의상부터, 양가 부모님께 보내는 물품, 화려한 피로연 등 도시 결혼식에서 선물 문화는 재력을 과시하는 특권층의 문화와 결부되었다.\n결혼러시다. 청첩장과 답례품을 금한 가정의례에 관한 법률이 발효하는 6월 이전에 결혼식을 올리려는 사람들이 많은데다가 시즌이 겹쳤기 때문이다. 서울의 경우 식장 예약은 시내 중심가의 일류예식장 6,7개소가 3월말까지 예약을 마감했고 중심가에서 벗어난 예식장에 예약문의가 몰려들고 있다... 식장이 한 개뿐인 C호텔의 경우 평일엔 한 쌍, 토일요일엔 2,3쌍이 호화예식을 오리며 하루 문의 전화는 약 30통, S호텔의 경우 하루 한 쌍꼴로 예식을 올리며 문의 전화도 20~30통씩 온다고 했다.\n- <조선일보> 1973년 3월 8일 기사\n축의금 주고 받으면 벌금 50만 원\n때문에 1969년, ‘가정의례준칙’이 만들어지기도 했다. 쉽게 말하면 결혼식에 허례허식을 없애고 낭비를 최소화할 것을 나라 차원에서 강제한 것이다. 일종의 사치금지법이었는데 내용이 꽤 구체적이었다. 약혼식과 청첩장을 없애고, 결혼답례품은 주지 않고, 신랑신부 접수대를 없애서 축의금을 주고받지 못하게 했다. 또한 폐백과 화환도 없애고자 했다.\n심지어 청첩장을 돌리거나, 답례품을 주거나, 주류와 음식물 접대 등의 행위를 하면 50만 원 이하의 벌금을 매기기도 했다. 1960년대 군사독재정권 시절의 정서가 엿보이는 대목이다. 하지만 나라님도 못하는 일이 있는 법. 정부가 강제한 준칙들은 일반 국민들의 일상과는 어울리지 않는 이야기였다. 또한 힘 있고 권력 있는 사람들은 아랑곳하지않고 호화예식을 누렸고, 결국 가정의례준칙은 1999년 폐지된다.\n빠른 속도로 변화한 축의금 문화\n1980년대 이후 경제가 발전하면서 소득 수준이 증가하고, 도시화가 진척되면서 서구적인 생활 양식이 일반화되었다. 인구가 증가하고 그만큼 결혼식이 늘면서 1990년대 이후 현금 축의금 문화는 완연한 일상으로 자리잡았고 사회적 고민도 함께 시작된다.\n매년 봄이 되면 적정 축의금에 대한 설문조사나 기사가 쏟아지고, 거액의 축의금을 자녀에게 줄 경우 증여세 과세를 어떻게 할 것인가를 두고 논란이 벌어지고, 첫날밤에 축의금을 이야기하면서 부부싸움을 벌이는 내용이 드라마에 등장하기도 했다. 그만큼 현금 축의금은 1990년대 이후 지금까지 우리의 결혼 문화에서 공고한 지위를 누리고 있으며, 시간이 흐르며 차곡차곡 몸값(?)도 올라만 갔다. 잘 살게 된만큼 챙겨야 할 정성의 액수 또한 높아진 것이다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n자료= 1994년, 2005년은 갤럽, 2018년은 틸리언 프로\n한때는 선물 문화가 당연했던 시대도 있었지만, 어느덧 결혼에서 선물은 부수적인 것, 혹은 정말 가까운 친구 혹은 가족이 별도로 준비하는 예외적인 것이 되고 말았다. 그렇다고 선물은 따뜻하고, 돈은 차갑게 볼 필요는 없다.\n중국, 일본, 베트남, 인도네시아 등 아시아 국가들은 현금으로 결혼을 축하하는 문화가 일반적이다. 불가리아·루마니아·폴란드 같은 동유럽 국가들도 마찬가지. 결혼 선물 문화로 유명한 미국 역시 2000년대 들어 갈수록 현금 축의금이 늘고 있는 추세라고 한다. 세계사적 관점으로 보았을 때, 현금은 결혼을 축하하는 문화의 중심으로 우뚝 서고 있는 셈이다.\n축하할 일이 유난히 많은 계절, 한 번쯤 고민해보자. 주는 사람도 받는 사람도, 금액의 크고 작음을 너머 어떻게 하면 깊은 마음을 주고 받을 수 있는지 말이다. 결국 중요한 것은 돈으로도 살 수 없는 것은 진심어린 축하이니 말이다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

'노재팬'에 코로나19 팬데믹까지 겹치면서 발길이 뚝 끊겼던 일본에 다시 한국인 관광객이 늘고 있는 모양새다.\n이미 국내 주요 여행사가 판매 중인 7~8월 일본 여행 얼리버드 패키지의 좌석이 거의 찬 상황이다.\n한국 시장에서 철퇴를 맞았던 일본 브랜드 유니클로 등의 실적도 성장하고 있다. 일본 맥주도 인기를 끌면서 지난해 수입맥주 가운데 일본맥주가 1위로 뛰어 올랐다.\n1일 여행업계에 따르면 모두투어는 7~8월 성수기를 앞두고 판매 중인 일본 '얼리버드 패키지'의 예약이 이미 80% 마감됐다.\n.css-182qzvh{white-space:pre-wrap;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}기록적인 엔저가 이어지면서 일본 여행이 국내에서 인기를 끌고 있다. 국토교통부 실시간 항공 통계에 따르면 올해 1~3월 전체 국제선 여객(454만3517명) 중 일본으로 향한 여객수는 186만7575명으로 1위를 기록했다. 이는 1년 전인 2023년 1분기(1~3월) 133만6342명과 비교해 39.8% 증가한 것이다. (중략)\n\n\n코로나19 팬데믹으로 인해 눌려있던 여행 수요가 폭발하고 있고, 이에 슈퍼 엔저까지 합쳐지면서 일본 여행 수요가 폭발적으로 증가하고 있습니다.\n지난 3월 일본을 찾은 외국인은 사상 처음으로 300만 명을 돌파했어요. 그중 한국인이 가장 많았다고요. 슈퍼 엔저 현상이 지속되는 지금, 일본 여행 수요가 오른 이유를 조금 더 자세히 살펴볼까요?\n첫째, 엔화가 쌉니다. 지금 원·엔 환율은 최근 10년 중 최저 수준입니다. 앞으로도 한동안 더 엔저 현상이 이어질 것으로 예상되는데요. 지금 일본을 방문하면 3~4년 전보다 체감적으로 물가가 20% 정도 싸다고 느낄 수 있을 거예요.\n둘째, 일본 여행 상품 가격이 저렴해집니다. 엔저로 인해 지난해부터 꾸준히 늘고 있는 일본 여행객들로 항공사는 운항 횟수를 늘렸고, 여행사는 여행 상품을 늘리는 등 오랜만에 찾아온 기회를 잡기 위해 노력하고 있어요.\n셋째, 명품이나 위스키 등 사치재 구입에 유리합니다. 일본 백화점은 프로모션, 할인, 면세 쇼핑 및 다양한 혜택을 제공함으로써 더 많은 외국인 방문객을 유치하고 일본에 있는 동안 더 많은 소비를 하도록 유도하고 있습니다. 외국인 대상 백화점 할인 카드, 면세, 그리고 슈퍼 엔저를 활용한다면 국내에서 비싸서 못 샀던 물건들을 상대적으로 저렴한 가격에 구입할 수 있어요.\n반면 일본 내부에서는 이런 여행객 증가 현상이 반갑지만은 않다는 의견도 있습니다. 일본이 ‘가성비 좋은 여행지'로 변모한 것에 대한 안타까움, 여행객들이 소비하는 돈을 달러로 환산하면 크게 달라지지 않았기에 국익 측면에서 큰 수혜가 없다는 이유 때문입니다.\n\n\n엔고 현상: 엔저 현상과 반대로 엔화의 가치가 오르는 현상. 일본 엔화가 미국 달러화보다 가치가 높아지면, 수출입 가격에 영향을 주기 때문에 일본의 대외 수출이 불리해져요. 반면 일본과 경쟁 산업에 있는 우리나라 수출 기업은 상대적으로 수출에 유리할 수 있습니다. 엔저 현상과 완전히 반대되는 현상이 일어나요.\n플라자 합의: 1985년 미국·일본·독일·영국·프랑스 5개국이 뉴욕 플라자 호텔에 모여 엔화 가치를 상승시키기로 합의했던 사건. 일본의 수출품으로 미국이 대규모 적자를 이어가자, 엔화 가치를 상승(엔고 현상)시켜 미국 산업을 보호하려 했어요. 플라자 합의로 인해 일본은 수출 경쟁력이 약화되었고 ‘잃어버린 30년’에 접어들기 시작했습니다.\n아베노믹스: 일본 전 총리 아베 신조가 추진한 경제 정책. 20년 가까이 이어져 온 일본의 디플레이션과 엔고 탈출을 위해 엔화의 가치를 하락시켜 수출을 늘렸어요. 경제 성장을 촉진하기 위해 시행된 정책이었어요.\n\n\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 함영범\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}해당 콘텐츠는 2024.5.30. 기준으로 작성되었습니다.",

GDP가 오르고 경제 성장 지표가 좋아지면서 또 총수요를 자극하게 되고, 인플레이션의 압력도 올라갈 거예요.\n이렇게 국내 물가가 오를 가능성이 높아진다면, 한국은행은 물가를 잡기 위해 기준 금리를 올리게 될 수 있습니다. (금리가 오르면 돈을 빌리는 비용이 비싸지니, 돈을 덜 빌리게 됩니다. 이는 투자를 줄이고 경제 활동을 둔화시켜 인플레이션을 막기 위함이지요)\n2) 수요 경로(Demand Channel)\n미국이 금리 목표치를 올려 긴축적인 통화정책(monetary tightening)을 시행하게 되면, 돈을 빌리는 비용이 비싸지는 것이니 투자가 감소하고 경기가 둔화될 수 있습니다.\n이로 인해 외국 상품에 대한 미국 내 수요가 감소한다면 우리나라의 대미 수출도 줄어들 수 있을 거고요. 이와 같은 상황에서는 (첫 번째 환율 경로와 달리) 한국의 GDP와 물가상승률이 오히려 떨어질 수 있습니다.\n수요 경로를 통해 한국의 경제 성장에 부정적인 영향이 커진다면, 한국은행이 기준 금리를 인상하기는 힘들테고요.\n3) 금융 경로 (Financial Channel)\n초단기 금리인 연방기금금리에 대한 목표치가 올라가면, 장기 시장금리도 따라서 올라가는 경향을 보입니다.\n예를 들어, 연준의 금리 목표치 인상으로 미국의 장기 국채 금리가 다른 국가에 비해서 상대적으로 높아질 경우 글로벌 투자자들은 기존에 투자했던 나라에서 자금을 빼고 미국의 장기 채권에 투자를 하게 될 것입니다. (미 국채 상품은 잘 망하지 않을거라는 믿음이 있기 때문에 안 그래도 수요가 많은데요. 금리까지 오른다면 투자자들에게 더 매력적으로 느껴지겠죠)\n우리나라를 예시로 들어본다면 이 과정에서 외국인 자본이 급격하게 유출되면서 금융 시장이 큰 타격을 받게 됩니다. GDP와 물가에도 부정적인 영향을 줄 수 있고요.\n이렇게 급격한 외국인 자본 유출로 인한 부정적 충격이 걱정된다면, 한국은행 입장에서는 미국과의 금리 격차를 줄이기 위해 기준 금리를 올리는 것을 고려할 수도 있을 거예요.\nG: 미국 금리가 오른다 해서 우리나라 금리가 반드시 오르는건 아니군요. 어떤 경로로, 어디에, 어떤 영향을 미치느냐에 따라 각각 다른 양상을 그릴 수 있겠네요.\nK: 맞아요. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}미국의 금리 목표치 인상은 각 경로마다 다른 모습으로 우리나라 GDP와 물가에 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\n정리하면 아래 표와 같은데요. 각 경로 별로 발생할 수 있는 효과들을 종합적으로 고려해야만, 연준의 정책금리 인상이 우리나라 기준금리에 미치는 영향을 파악할 수 있습니다.\n\n자료: Caldara, D., Ferrante, F., & Queralto, A.

(링크)\n생각보다 훨씬 더 다양한 \n금리의 종류\nG: 그럼 뉴스에서 말하는 ‘금리'는 항상 기준금리라 이해하면 되는 걸까요?\nK: 우리가 뭉뚱그려서 ‘금리’라 부르지만, 실제로는 다양한 종류의 금리들이 존재한답니다.\n대표적으로는 뉴스에 가장 많이 나오는 한국은행의 기준금리가 있고요. 시장의 수요와 공급 원리를 따라가는 시장금리가 있습니다.\n시장금리는 금융상품에 따라 만기와 금리가 달라요. 만기 1년 이하인 단기금융시장(자금시장) 금리의 대표 사례로는 양도성예금증서(CD) 금리가 있고요. 만기 1년 이상인 장기금융시장(자본시장) 금리의 대표 사례로는 국고채 금리, 회사채 금리가 있어요. 그리고 은행에 가면 볼 수 있는 예금 금리와 대출 금리도 여기에 해당됩니다.\n\n🤑 조금은 어려울 수 있는 금융상품 금리, 자세히 설명해드릴게요\n\n✅ 양도성예금증서(CD: Certificate of Deposit) 금리\nCD는 은행이 예금의 탈을 쓰고 고객에게 돈을 빌리는 상품인데요. 보통의 예금 상품은 고객이 ‘돈을 맡겨야겠다'는 필요 때문에 은행에 돈을 맡기고 만기가 되면 이자를 받아가는 구조라면, 양도성예금은 은행이 돈 쓸 데는 많은데 예금하는 고객이 적어 더 많은 돈이 필요할 때 고객에게 돈을 빌리고 만기가 되면 이자를 주는 구조입니다. (이에 대한 증거로 양도성예금'증서'를 찍어 고객에게 제공하는 것이고요)\n돈을 운용하는 구조는 유사하나, 고객와 은행 중 누가 필요성을 느끼는지에 따라 살짝 달라집니다. CD와 예금이 크게 다르지 않다 느껴질 수 있지만, CD는 돈을 오래 묶어두지 않아도 된다는 점과 예금자보호법에 따른 예금자보호를 받을 수 없다는 점이 고객 입장에서 결정적으로 달라요. \n보통 은행에서 판매하는 정기예금 상품의 만기는 1년 이상인 반면, CD는 최소 30일 이상 1년 이내 범위에서 원하는 만기*를 정할 수 있습니다. 여유 자금을 짧게 굴리는 투자자들, 거액을 거래하는 법인기업이나 금융기관이 많이 거래하는 금융상품이에요.\n* 보통 91일(3개월물), 181일(6개월물) 단위로 거래\n주택담보대출에 적용하는 변동금리는 CD 금리와 연동되는 경우가 많습니다. 주택담보대출은 기본이 10년, 여차하면 20년, 30년, 40년이죠. 만약 3% 금리로 대출을 해줬는데, 5년 뒤 금리가 10%가 되면? 은행 입장에선 손해보는 장사겠죠. 아무리 금리가 올라도 몇십년간 3%만 이자를 받아야 하니까요. \n그래서 아무리 길어도 1년이 만기인 CD에 연동시키는 것입니다. 시시각각 변하는 금리 상황에 맞춰 이자를 받을 수 있으니까요.\n✅ 국고채 금리\n국고채는 정부가 돈이 필요해서 국민들에게 돈을 빌리고 그 증거로 나눠주는 차용증이고, 국고채 금리는 정부가 국고채를 발행해 돈을 빌릴 때의 금리입니다.\n국고채는 1년, 3년, 5년 만기부터 20년, 30년, 50년 만기까지 종류가 많습니다. 뉴스나 기사에서 주로 볼 수 있는 국고채 3년물 금리는 정부가 3년 간 돈을 빌릴 때의 금리, 국고채 5년물 금리는 5년 간 돈을 빌릴 때의 금리를 말하는 것이죠.\n보통은 만기가 길어질수록 금리가 높아집니다. 돈을 묶어두는 기간이 길어질수록 더 많은 이자를 주는 것이죠. 국고채의 위험은 매우 낮습니다. 나라가 망하지 않는 이상 돈을 떼먹힐 일이 없기 때문이죠. 투자자 입장에선 수익률은 낮지만 거의 100% 안전하게 수익을 올릴 수 있는 금융상품입니다.\n✅ 회사채 금리\n회사채는 기업이 돈이 필요해서 사람들에게 돈을 빌리고 그 증거로 나눠주는 차용증이고, 회사채 금리는 기업이 회사채를 발행해 돈을 빌릴 때의 금리입니다.\n회사채의 종류는 굉장히 다양하지만 기본적인 내용은 같아요. “10,000원을 빌려주시면 매년 N원의 이자를 드리고 원금은 M년 뒤에 갚겠습니다.”\n회사채는 국고채와 달리 믿을 만한 기업도 있고 못 믿을 만한 기업도 있어서, 엄청나게 많은 등급으로 나누어 관리됩니다. 돈 떼 먹힐 가능성이 낮은 기업부터 높은 기업까지 AAA, AA+, AA, AA-, A+, A, A-, BBB+, BBB, BBB- … CCC, CC, C, D 순으로 줄 세우는 것이죠.\n\nG: 아하, 뉴스에 나오는 ‘금리'가 모두 같은 ‘금리’가 아니었을 수 있겠군요. 그럼 기준금리만 미국의 영향을 받는 것인지, 아니면 다른 금리도 영향을 받는지 궁금해지네요.\nK: 기준금리 뿐 아니라 시장금리도 다양한 경로를 통해 미국 금리의 영향을 받게 됩니다. 가장 대표적인 것이 금융 경로인데요.\n만약 미국 국채 금리가 올라가게 되면, 글로벌 투자 자금이 미국으로 유입되고 달러가 강세를 보이게 됩니다. 반대로 우리나라에서 글로벌 투자 자금이 대규모로 유출된다면 원화의 가치는 떨어지고 원화 채권의 수요도 감소하겠죠.\n이러한 상황에서는 채권을 통한 자금 조달에 제한이 생기는데요. 우리나라 채권에 대한 투자 수요를 다시 끌어올리려면 더 높은 수익률을 제공해야 합니다. 결과적으로 미국 국채 금리가 올라가면 우리나라 국고채 금리도 올라가게 되는 것이죠.\nG: 글로벌 투자자들의 자금이 어떻게 움직이느냐에 따라 금리가 오르고 내리니, 시장금리도 당연히 영향을 받을 수밖에 없겠군요.\nK: 그렇습니다. 아래 그림은 2020년 1월부터 2024년 5월까지 한국과 미국의 10년 만기 국채 금리의 추이를 보여주고 있는데요. 두 국가의 장기 국채 금리가 비슷하게 움직이고 있는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n참고로, GDP 대비 양국에 투자하고 있는 자금의 비중이 높아질수록 금융연계성(Financial Linkage)이 올라간다고 말하는데요. 코로나19 이후 한국과 미국 간의 금융연계성이 높아졌고, 이로 인해 한국의 채권 금리가 미국의 채권 금리에 더 민감하게 반응하며 같은 방향으로 움직이는 경향도 강해졌습니다.\n\n자료: Refinitive\n오늘은 미국의 금리가 우리나라 금리에 어떻게 영향을 미칠 수 있는지를 살펴보았는데요. 앞으로 미국이 정책금리를 낮추는 방향으로 정책이 전환되면, 우리나라 금리의 반응도 새로운 양상을 보일 수 있습니다.\n오늘 알게 된 여러가지 경로와 연관성을 바탕으로, 양국의 금리가 앞으로 어떻게 변화할지 관심을 갖고 지켜 보도록 하시죠.\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0 8px;cursor:pointer;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--adaptiveGrey700);}\n.css-1dzrkjz{width:16px;margin-right:8px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;}\n\n[참고자료]\n\n\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이서영\n해당 콘텐츠는 2024.5.28. 기준으로 작성되었습니다.",
