        "content:encodedSnippet": "Getting real with virtual threads\nBy Vadim Filanovsky, Mike Huang, Danny Thomas and Martin Chalupa\nIntro\nNetflix has an extensive history of using Java as our primary programming language across our vast fleet of microservices. As we pick up newer versions of Java, our JVM Ecosystem team seeks out new language features that can improve the ergonomics and performance of our systems. In a recent article, we detailed how our workloads benefited from switching to generational ZGC as our default garbage collector when we migrated to Java 21. Virtual threads is another feature we are excited to adopt as part of this migration.\nFor those new to virtual threads, they are described as “lightweight threads that dramatically reduce the effort of writing, maintaining, and observing high-throughput concurrent applications.” Their power comes from their ability to be suspended and resumed automatically via continuations when blocking operations occur, thus freeing the underlying operating system threads to be reused for other operations. Leveraging virtual threads can unlock higher performance when utilized in the appropriate context.\nIn this article we discuss one of the peculiar cases that we encountered along our path to deploying virtual threads on Java 21.\nThe problem\nNetflix engineers raised several independent reports of intermittent timeouts and hung instances to the Performance Engineering and JVM Ecosystem teams. Upon closer examination, we noticed a set of common traits and symptoms. In all cases, the apps affected ran on Java 21 with SpringBoot 3 and embedded Tomcat serving traffic on REST endpoints. The instances that experienced the issue simply stopped serving traffic even though the JVM on those instances remained up and running. One clear symptom characterizing the onset of this issue is a persistent increase in the number of sockets in closeWait state as illustrated by the graph below:\n\nCollected diagnostics\nSockets remaining in closeWait state indicate that the remote peer closed the socket, but it was never closed on the local instance, presumably because the application failed to do so. This can often indicate that the application is hanging in an abnormal state, in which case application thread dumps may reveal additional insight.\nIn order to troubleshoot this issue, we first leveraged our alerts system to catch an instance in this state. Since we periodically collect and persist thread dumps for all JVM workloads, we can often retroactively piece together the behavior by examining these thread dumps from an instance. However, we were surprised to find that all our thread dumps show a perfectly idle JVM with no clear activity. Reviewing recent changes revealed that these impacted services enabled virtual threads, and we knew that virtual thread call stacks do not show up in jstack-generated thread dumps. To obtain a more complete thread dump containing the state of the virtual threads, we used the “jcmd Thread.dump_to_file” command instead. As a last-ditch effort to introspect the state of JVM, we also collected a heap dump from the instance.\nAnalysis\nThread dumps revealed thousands of “blank” virtual threads:\n#119821 \"\" virtual\n#119820 \"\" virtual\n#119823 \"\" virtual\n#120847 \"\" virtual\n#119822 \"\" virtual\n...\nThese are the VTs (virtual threads) for which a thread object is created, but has not started running, and as such, has no stack trace. In fact, there were approximately the same number of blank VTs as the number of sockets in closeWait state. To make sense of what we were seeing, we need to first understand how VTs operate.\nA virtual thread is not mapped 1:1 to a dedicated OS-level thread. Rather, we can think of it as a task that is scheduled to a fork-join thread pool. When a virtual thread enters a blocking call, like waiting for a Future, it relinquishes the OS thread it occupies and simply remains in memory until it is ready to resume. In the meantime, the OS thread can be reassigned to execute other VTs in the same fork-join pool. This allows us to multiplex a lot of VTs to just a handful of underlying OS threads. In JVM terminology, the underlying OS thread is referred to as the “carrier thread” to which a virtual thread can be “mounted” while it executes and “unmounted” while it waits. A great in-depth description of virtual thread is available in JEP 444.\nIn our environment, we utilize a blocking model for Tomcat, which in effect holds a worker thread for the lifespan of a request. By enabling virtual threads, Tomcat switches to virtual execution. Each incoming request creates a new virtual thread that is simply scheduled as a task on a Virtual Thread Executor. We can see Tomcat creates a VirtualThreadExecutor here.\nTying this information back to our problem, the symptoms correspond to a state when Tomcat keeps creating a new web worker VT for each incoming request, but there are no available OS threads to mount them onto.\nWhy is Tomcat stuck?\nWhat happened to our OS threads and what are they busy with? As described here, a VT will be pinned to the underlying OS thread if it performs a blocking operation while inside a synchronized block or method. This is exactly what is happening here. Here is a relevant snippet from a thread dump obtained from the stuck instance:\n#119515 \"\" virtual\n      java.base/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n      java.base/java.lang.VirtualThread.parkOnCarrierThread(VirtualThread.java:661)\n      java.base/java.lang.VirtualThread.park(VirtualThread.java:593)\n      java.base/java.lang.System$2.parkVirtualThread(System.java:2643)\n      java.base/jdk.internal.misc.VirtualThreads.park(VirtualThreads.java:54)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:219)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:754)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:990)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock$Sync.lock(ReentrantLock.java:153)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.lock(ReentrantLock.java:322)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.CountBoundedQueue.offer(CountBoundedQueue.java:54)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.AsyncReporter$BoundedAsyncReporter.report(AsyncReporter.java:230)\n      zipkin2.reporter.brave.AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.end(AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.java:214)\n      brave.internal.handler.NoopAwareSpanHandler$CompositeSpanHandler.end(NoopAwareSpanHandler.java:98)\n      brave.internal.handler.NoopAwareSpanHandler.end(NoopAwareSpanHandler.java:48)\n      brave.internal.recorder.PendingSpans.finish(PendingSpans.java:116)\n      brave.RealSpan.finish(RealSpan.java:134)\n      brave.RealSpan.finish(RealSpan.java:129)\n      io.micrometer.tracing.brave.bridge.BraveSpan.end(BraveSpan.java:117)\n      io.micrometer.tracing.annotation.AbstractMethodInvocationProcessor.after(AbstractMethodInvocationProcessor.java:67)\n      io.micrometer.tracing.annotation.ImperativeMethodInvocationProcessor.proceedUnderSynchronousSpan(ImperativeMethodInvocationProcessor.java:98)\n      io.micrometer.tracing.annotation.ImperativeMethodInvocationProcessor.process(ImperativeMethodInvocationProcessor.java:73)\n      io.micrometer.tracing.annotation.SpanAspect.newSpanMethod(SpanAspect.java:59)\n      java.base/jdk.internal.reflect.DirectMethodHandleAccessor.invoke(DirectMethodHandleAccessor.java:103)\n      java.base/java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:580)\n      org.springframework.aop.aspectj.AbstractAspectJAdvice.invokeAdviceMethodWithGivenArgs(AbstractAspectJAdvice.java:637)\n...\nIn this stack trace, we enter the synchronization in brave.RealSpan.finish(RealSpan.java:134). This virtual thread is effectively pinned — it is mounted to an actual OS thread even while it waits to acquire a reentrant lock. There are 3 VTs in this exact state and another VT identified as “<redacted> @DefaultExecutor - 46542” that also follows the same code path. These 4 virtual threads are pinned while waiting to acquire a lock. Because the app is deployed on an instance with 4 vCPUs, the fork-join pool that underpins VT execution also contains 4 OS threads. Now that we have exhausted all of them, no other virtual thread can make any progress. This explains why Tomcat stopped processing the requests and why the number of sockets in closeWait state keeps climbing. Indeed, Tomcat accepts a connection on a socket, creates a request along with a virtual thread, and passes this request/thread to the executor for processing. However, the newly created VT cannot be scheduled because all of the OS threads in the fork-join pool are pinned and never released. So these newly created VTs are stuck in the queue, while still holding the socket.\nWho has the lock?\nNow that we know VTs are waiting to acquire a lock, the next question is: Who holds the lock? Answering this question is key to understanding what triggered this condition in the first place. Usually a thread dump indicates who holds the lock with either “- locked <0x…> (at …)” or “Locked ownable synchronizers,” but neither of these show up in our thread dumps. As a matter of fact, no locking/parking/waiting information is included in the jcmd-generated thread dumps. This is a limitation in Java 21 and will be addressed in the future releases. Carefully combing through the thread dump reveals that there are a total of 6 threads contending for the same ReentrantLock and associated Condition. Four of these six threads are detailed in the previous section. Here is another thread:\n#119516 \"\" virtual\n      java.base/java.lang.VirtualThread.park(VirtualThread.java:582)\n      java.base/java.lang.System$2.parkVirtualThread(System.java:2643)\n      java.base/jdk.internal.misc.VirtualThreads.park(VirtualThreads.java:54)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:219)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:754)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:990)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock$Sync.lock(ReentrantLock.java:153)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock.lock(ReentrantLock.java:322)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.CountBoundedQueue.offer(CountBoundedQueue.java:54)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.AsyncReporter$BoundedAsyncReporter.report(AsyncReporter.java:230)\n      zipkin2.reporter.brave.AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.end(AsyncZipkinSpanHandler.java:214)\n      brave.internal.handler.NoopAwareSpanHandler$CompositeSpanHandler.end(NoopAwareSpanHandler.java:98)\n      brave.internal.handler.NoopAwareSpanHandler.end(NoopAwareSpanHandler.java:48)\n      brave.internal.recorder.PendingSpans.finish(PendingSpans.java:116)\n      brave.RealScopedSpan.finish(RealScopedSpan.java:64)\n      ...\nNote that while this thread seemingly goes through the same code path for finishing a span, it does not go through a synchronized block. Finally here is the 6th thread:\n#107 \"AsyncReporter <redacted>\"\n      java.base/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:221)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:754)\n      java.base/java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.awaitNanos(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1761)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.CountBoundedQueue.drainTo(CountBoundedQueue.java:81)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.AsyncReporter$BoundedAsyncReporter.flush(AsyncReporter.java:241)\n      zipkin2.reporter.internal.AsyncReporter$Flusher.run(AsyncReporter.java:352)\n      java.base/java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:1583)\nThis is actually a normal platform thread, not a virtual thread. Paying particular attention to the line numbers in this stack trace, it is peculiar that the thread seems to be blocked within the internal acquire() method after completing the wait. In other words, this calling thread owned the lock upon entering awaitNanos(). We know the lock was explicitly acquired here. However, by the time the wait completed, it could not reacquire the lock. Summarizing our thread dump analysis:\nhttps://medium.com/media/c09dd46b372e014eae5c9698b8a9e96d/href\nThere are 5 virtual threads and 1 regular thread waiting for the lock. Out of those 5 VTs, 4 of them are pinned to the OS threads in the fork-join pool. There’s still no information on who owns the lock. As there’s nothing more we can glean from the thread dump, our next logical step is to peek into the heap dump and introspect the state of the lock.\nInspecting the lock\nFinding the lock in the heap dump was relatively straightforward. Using the excellent Eclipse MAT tool, we examined the objects on the stack of the AsyncReporter non-virtual thread to identify the lock object. Reasoning about the current state of the lock was perhaps the trickiest part of our investigation. Most of the relevant code can be found in the AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java. While we don’t claim to fully understand the inner workings of it, we reverse-engineered enough of it to match against what we see in the heap dump. This diagram illustrates our findings:\n\nFirst off, the exclusiveOwnerThread field is null (2), signifying that no one owns the lock. We have an “empty” ExclusiveNode (3) at the head of the list (waiter is null and status is cleared) followed by another ExclusiveNode with waiter pointing to one of the virtual threads contending for the lock — #119516 (4). The only place we found that clears the exclusiveOwnerThread field is within the ReentrantLock.Sync.tryRelease() method (source link). There we also set state = 0 matching the state that we see in the heap dump (1).\nWith this in mind, we traced the code path to release() the lock. After successfully calling tryRelease(), the lock-holding thread attempts to signal the next waiter in the list. At this point, the lock-holding thread is still at the head of the list, even though ownership of the lock is effectively released. The next node in the list points to the thread that is about to acquire the lock.\nTo understand how this signaling works, let’s look at the lock acquire path in the AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.acquire() method. Grossly oversimplifying, it’s an infinite loop, where threads attempt to acquire the lock and then park if the attempt was unsuccessful:\nwhile(true) {\n   if (tryAcquire()) {\n      return; // lock acquired\n   }\n   park();\n}\nWhen the lock-holding thread releases the lock and signals to unpark the next waiter thread, the unparked thread iterates through this loop again, giving it another opportunity to acquire the lock. Indeed, our thread dump indicates that all of our waiter threads are parked on line 754. Once unparked, the thread that managed to acquire the lock should end up in this code block, effectively resetting the head of the list and clearing the reference to the waiter.\nTo restate this more concisely, the lock-owning thread is referenced by the head node of the list. Releasing the lock notifies the next node in the list while acquiring the lock resets the head of the list to the current node. This means that what we see in the heap dump reflects the state when one thread has already released the lock but the next thread has yet to acquire it. It’s a weird in-between state that should be transient, but our JVM is stuck here. We know thread #119516 was notified and is about to acquire the lock because of the ExclusiveNode state we identified at the head of the list. However, thread dumps show that thread #119516 continues to wait, just like other threads contending for the same lock. How can we reconcile what we see between the thread and heap dumps?\nThe lock with no place to run\nKnowing that thread #119516 was actually notified, we went back to the thread dump to re-examine the state of the threads. Recall that we have 6 total threads waiting for the lock with 4 of the virtual threads each pinned to an OS thread. These 4 will not yield their OS thread until they acquire the lock and proceed out of the synchronized block. #107 “AsyncReporter <redacted>” is a regular platform thread, so nothing should prevent it from proceeding if it acquires the lock. This leaves us with the last thread: #119516. It is a VT, but it is not pinned to an OS thread. Even if it’s notified to be unparked, it cannot proceed because there are no more OS threads left in the fork-join pool to schedule it onto. That’s exactly what happens here — although #119516 is signaled to unpark itself, it cannot leave the parked state because the fork-join pool is occupied by the 4 other VTs waiting to acquire the same lock. None of those pinned VTs can proceed until they acquire the lock. It’s a variation of the classic deadlock problem, but instead of 2 locks we have one lock and a semaphore with 4 permits as represented by the fork-join pool.\nNow that we know exactly what happened, it was easy to come up with a reproducible test case.\nConclusion\nVirtual threads are expected to improve performance by reducing overhead related to thread creation and context switching. Despite some sharp edges as of Java 21, virtual threads largely deliver on their promise. In our quest for more performant Java applications, we see further virtual thread adoption as a key towards unlocking that goal. We look forward to Java 23 and beyond, which brings a wealth of upgrades and hopefully addresses the integration between virtual threads and locking primitives.\nThis exploration highlights just one type of issue that performance engineers solve at Netflix. We hope this glimpse into our problem-solving approach proves valuable to others in their future investigations.\n\nJava 21 Virtual Threads - Dude, Where’s My Lock? was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Did you know? In 1936, Russian engineer Vladimir Lukyanov built a mechanical computer known as a Water Integrator that carefully manipulated water in a room full of interconnected pipes and pumps. The water level in various chambers represented stored numbers, and the computer could solve complex mathematical equations. I’m sure the last thing Vladimir wanted was a memory leak, am I right? 🤣\nWikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_integrator\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! This newsletter is the home of recent .NET and software development-related content.\n🌟 Featured Content\nThis month, we bring you featured content from Dan Clarke! Dan is an independent developer and consultant, specialising in .NET, Azure, and Kubernetes. He also hosts the Unhandled Exception Podcast; the .NET Oxford user-group; has a YouTube channel; newsletter; and a couple of Dometrain courses. Outside of work, Dan is a father of two, enjoys playing the guitar, and is an obsessive gym-goer.\nHey all! 👋 A massive thank you to JetBrains for inviting me on to be a guest author! As a huge fan of both ReSharper and Rider, this is a great honour!\nToday I want to talk about developer productivity. This is something I’ve always been interested in – perhaps because I don’t see myself as naturally being super-productive – so over time I’ve intentionally tried to learn tips and tricks to improve and get things done a bit faster.\nWhen reading about developer productivity, I come across the term “10x developer” quite a bit. I find this term interesting, but also quite detrimental. The main thing I dislike about it is the word “developer”. This suggests an individual that is an order of magnitude better than average. A so-called rockstar developer. Well, good for them. But let’s instead change the term to be more helpful to the average developer. Let’s call it “10x development” instead. In software development, there are massive multipliers to be had depending on how a task is approached. A developer who knows lots of productivity techniques and tools will be more productive. But I think the term “10x developer” focuses on the wrong thing. It focused on the individual, rather than the tasks themselves.\nHere are a few examples…\nYou need to fixup namespaces across your entire solution. Do you do it manually in each file? Or do you hit a keyboard shortcut so your IDE does it for you in seconds? How many “X” is that time-saving? 100-1000x maybe? Learning your IDE (Rider of course! 😉), and its various shortcuts – will mean you spend less time doing those things manually yourself.\nYou spend 2 months building a feature. Or you discover a library that does it for you. 2 months vs 1 hour? 300x?\nYou have a process that’s repeatable and needs to be done often. You manually do this process each day for the next few years. Or you automate it to get all that time back. 1000x?\nYou have a performance issue in your app. You manually try to work it out by putting logs and timers in code. Or you’ve previously learnt how to use a profiling tool which very quickly gives you a detailed analysis of what’s going on.\nAs developers, we have so much opportunity and power to automate tasks, leverage IDEs and tooling, and complete tasks WAY faster. I can’t think of another industry which allows the level of productivity hacking that we have.\nAnd lastly – of course, do make sure you’re being productive on the right things! You don’t want to be more productive at making your big ball of mud codebase even worse! Sometimes a great way to be more productive is to KISS (Keep It Super Simple) 🙂\nDeveloper productivity is a huge (and fascinating) topic, with many aspects to it. I wrote a blog post quite a few years ago that delves into more areas – eg. compound learning; note-taking; and focus. Speaking of focus – the Pomodoro technique is something I use heavily, which I’ve personally found has made a huge difference to my focus levels. I’ve recently recorded a short video about how I use this technique together with taking Pomodoro notes.\n🔗 Links\nHere’s the latest from the developer community.\nService Discovery in .NET – Microsoft Learn \nMoving from Controllers to Minimal API – Christian Brevik\nAuto-redirect in REST client tools – Damir Arh\nImage Analysis with Phi 3 Vision – Juanlu Elgurre\nAll the lists in .NET MAUI – David Ortinau\nHow to use the tasks view in JetBrains Rider – Khalid Abuhakmeh\nUnit Testing Best Practices in .NET C# – Ahmed Tarek\nBehind the Scenes of Collection Expressions Part 4: The Spread Element – Andrew Lock\nReadonly immutable and frozen collections in .NET and C# 13 Semi Auto-Properties– NDepend\nCreating Hashes in .NET – Damien Bowden\nAsync isn’t always async – Peter Toft Jølving\nIs .NET Aspire NuGet for Cloud Service Dependencies? – Phil Haack\nRefactoring a functional and reactive .NET MAUI app to a declarative UI using C# markup – Richard Woollcott\nTentative Roadmap for Wolverine 3.0 and Network Round Trips are Evil – Jeremy Miller\nDiscovering .NET codebases using code coverage and NCrunch – Tore Nestenius\nAutomate your .NET SDK updates for consistent and reproducible builds with global.json and Renovate – Anthony Simmon\nGetting to the (shadow)root of Vue 3 custom elements – Jaime Jones\nAvalonia and OpenGL Demo – Mårten Rånge\nShould Interfaces Be Asynchronous? – Mark Seemann\nBeef Lang (Where’s the Beef?!) – Beef Lang\nC# Wasm Recipes – SerratedSharp\nAppCenter is retiring!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Table of Contents\n\nWhy is prioritizing code quality so important?\nPutting the right team together\nCreating a culture of quality\nDefining and identifying performance challenges\nBalancing business needs with soft skills and the developer experience\nFinal words\n\nYou don’t have to do it alone – Meet Qodana for code quality\n\nWhy is prioritizing code quality so important?\nBuilding successful software products starts with getting the right team on board, but as any technical recruiter or team lead will tell you, this is often easier said than done. One of the greatest challenges leaders face is balancing culture, competency, and potential in order to grow teams that prioritize code and product quality as daily mantra – from the bottom up. \nCode quality standards are vital in business, as they enhance reliability and reduce errors and crashes for a better user experience. They facilitate easier updates and maintenance, improving team efficiency. This also allows for scaling business growth and, despite the upfront time investment, proves cost-efficient in the long run by reducing post-deployment hiccups. \nWell-structured code promotes better team collaboration. Therefore, maintaining code quality is a key strategy impacting product stability, team productivity, and overall business success.\nIn fact, the cost of poor code quality can be measured. According to Forbes, “poor software” cost the U.S. economy $2.08 trillion in 2020 alone.\nThat’s why this first installment of our new Qodana Leadership Series is a deep dive into the nuances of sourcing and nurturing developer talent in your team, especially if code quality is one of your main drivers. We’re also joined by educator, entrepreneur, and Team Lead (Orange Cyber Defence NL) Herman Du Preez, who offers insights into what this can look like in practice. Let’s dive in! \n\n\n\n\nPutting the right team together\n“A person who is underperforming or not a fit is a failure on my part. I chose them, I interviewed them, and I hired them. And in a worst case scenario, firing an underperformer can take a lot of time and effort” says Herman Du Preez, European Team Lead for a global cyber defense company, when asked about what he looks for in new team candidates. \n“So when I’m recruiting for my team, I’m looking for that fire. The people you want at your side need to share a passion for the thing you’re trying to do, whether they’re trying to configure a new tool, learn a new (coding) language, or brute force a bank’s VPN endpoint.\n\n\n\n\n“The reality of IT is that you can’t compete against the person who’s been up at night working on what they’re interested in, who lives and breathes solving problems, or who finds creative executions. I look for the people who are constantly thinking about the problems they couldn’t solve.” \nDu Preez’s sentiment seems to be echoed in results from the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, which show that more than 63% of employed developers and managers spend over 30 minutes a day searching for answers and solutions to problems. \nBut aside from “fire”, more specifically defined as drive, interest, and obsession, what other qualities can indicate compatibility with a quality-focused team? Attention to detail, a desire for continuous improvement, motivation, and familiarity with quality assurance frameworks could all suggest a candidate is a good fit.  \nFrom 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey\n\n\n\nCreating a culture of quality\nWhile attracting quality-focused developers is an important factor in itself, leaders can also foster a culture of quality in the team. Building this culture is a strategic move that can accelerate project completion and improve the end product. But what does this look like in practice?\n1. Setting clear quality standards: Leaders can establish clear, easy-to-understand standards for code quality that align with both the team’s capacity and the project’s goals. This can include detailing expected methods, defining naming conventions, emphasizing comment etiquette, and much more. It can also be a democratic process, taking into account the opinions and desires of the team. \n2. Leading by example: Leaders should embody the qualities they want to see. They can do this by diving into code reviews themselves, giving thorough feedback, and “walking the talk”. As renowned business educator Marshall Goldsmith once famously said: “One of the most important things a leader can do is to lead by example. If you want everyone else to be passionate, committed, motivated, and dedicated – you go first.”  \n“One of the most important things a leader can do is to lead by example. If you want everyone else to be passionate, committed, motivated, and dedicated – you go first.” – Marshall Goldsmith\n3. Encouraging peer reviews: Implementing and encouraging code review as a regular part of the development process enhances its importance in the team’s mind. This can lead to better knowledge sharing and a collaborative environment while improving overall code quality.\n“​​In a group of 11 programs developed by the same group of people, the first 5 were developed without reviews. The remaining 6 were developed with reviews. After all the programs were released to production, the first 5 had an average of 4.5 errors per 100 lines of code. The 6 that had been inspected had an average of only 0.82 errors per 100. Reviews cut the errors by over 80 percent.” – Steve McConall, CodeComplete\n4. Empowering education: High-quality training and resources can enhance your team’s knowledge of good programming habits and refactoring techniques, and the effective use of testing frameworks can support a team mentality that prioritizes quality. This training could be in the form of workshops, online courses, or knowledge-sharing sessions. \n“In a previous role in a small company, we would hire people only to find they had learned bad habits and didn’t follow methodologies properly. So we hired fresh out of university and trained them ourselves over 4 to 6 months to get them started,” says Du Preez. \n\n\n\n\n5. Utilizing quality assurance tools: Encourage the use of static analysis tools, linters, or advanced integrated development environments (IDEs) that spot and highlight issues in the code. Coupled with continuous integration tools, these can flag potential issues quickly. For example, in an empirical study on the effectiveness of static C code analyzers for vulnerability detection, 77% of open-source projects (from a sample of 168,214) used code analyzers to detect vulnerabilities, which makes sense given that C and C++ are among the languages that are at the root of most vulnerabilities.  \n6. Rewarding quality: Incorporate recognition or incentives for creating high-quality code. This could be in team meetings, via emails, or in performance reviews. By highlighting success stories within the team, others may be motivated to follow suit.\n7. Making quality a part of regular discussions: Regularly emphasize the importance of quality in meetings, reviews, and team check-ins. Also, constructively address issues or bottlenecks challenging the team’s ability to produce high-quality code. \n8. Promoting a psychologically safe environment: Encourage an environment where it’s safe to admit mistakes and learn from them. This can help you catch and rectify code issues earlier, and it reinforces a quality-first mindset.\nDu Preez’s take on this? “You’re allowed to make every mistake once. In fact, I encourage you to get out there and speed that process up. My career is a stack of failures propping up some successes and it’s working. Sometimes we are so focused on the impact of the mistake that we lose the opportunity.” \n\n\n\n\nWhen asked about practical ways to create safety, he added that “anonymous questions should be in place for learning, etc. It’s easy to implement with forms, and participants should be able to check the source code and see that it’s really anonymous.”\n9. Balancing quality and speed: Make sure that while striving for high-quality code, developers aren’t burdened with unrealistic expectations around speed. Overworking can lead to more errors in code, which defeats the purpose of a quality-first approach.\nBy incorporating these strategies, team leaders can foster a robust code quality culture, leading to better products and a more cohesive, empowered team. But what happens when this doesn’t work out?\nDefining and identifying performance challenges\nRobust analysis of your codebase can help you identify potential problems like code smells, security vulnerabilities, duplications, and discrepancies with coding standards. By reviewing these insights, you can pinpoint areas where your developers might be struggling. \nYou can also use tools to suggest solutions for the issues it identifies, allowing “underperforming” or inexperienced developers to learn and improve over time. This creates a learning opportunity that doesn’t require you to be actively involved at every step. You can focus on other leadership tasks like relationship building. \nOver and above this, detailed objective reports can help you track progress over time. By evaluating these reports, you can identify worrying patterns or failures to adhere to coding standards. This can help you spot underperformance or organizational challenges early.\nRemember, it’s important to use the insights from tools like Qodana as a basis for supportive discussions with your developers about opportunities for improvement and growth, rather than as a punitive measure. A feel of continuous learning and improvement can greatly boost a team’s performance.\nBalancing business needs with soft skills and the developer experience\nIt’s no secret that strong communication skills, the ability to problem solve, and a good level of emotional intelligence will take you far as a leader. But the will to delegate, resolve conflict, and mentor effectively are equally as important. \n“Don’t forget encouragement,” says Du Preez. “It’s a simple thing but I’ve seen people take ideas they never would have tried and run with them because they were encouraged to do so. Now its conference talks and new service lines as a result. What the average person often needs is someone to look at their work and encourage them to take action.”\nFinal words\nOne of the ways we can define a quality focused leader is by their flexibility and desire to navigate change. According to Du Preez, “it’s okay to try new things, and if it fails, fall back. But a bad leader gets locked into the rigidity of what a service looks like so they’re killing ideas.” \nYou don’t have to do it alone – Meet Qodana for code quality\nFind advocates in your team who want to support the goal of increasing product quality and code excellence.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2024/07/intellij-platform-gradle-plugin-2-0/",
        "pubDate": "Tue, 30 Jul 2024 17:26:35 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Version 2.0 of the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is now available! Previously called the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin, this updated plugin for the Gradle build system simplifies the configuration of environments for building, testing, verifying, and publishing plugins for IntelliJ-based IDEs. Redesigned and rewritten, it addresses community-reported issues and feature requests from previous versions.\nThe path to 2.0\nThe project to create this plugin began in 2015 with the goal of simplifying the development and testing of plugins for JetBrains IDEs. Initially, it was developed in Groovy, which remained the primary language for the first six years, during the 0.x releases.\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2021, version 1.0 was released, marking a complete migration to Kotlin. This transition addressed multiple issues thanks to Kotlin’s strong typing and null safety, though the core architecture remained unchanged. Around the same time, Gradle announced the configuration and build cache mechanisms. Those improvements in the Gradle build system highlighted fundamental weaknesses in the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin, revealing that maintaining it without workarounds was no longer viable.\nIn the summer of 2023, we started adjusting the core functionality – the beginning of a challenging, year-long journey towards the release of version 2.0.\n\nNew strategy for repository and dependency management\nOne of our main goals was fixing an architectural problem in the 1.x versions, which applied repositories and dependencies implicitly during task runtime. This approach had numerous side effects, addressed in the new 2.0 release.\nRepositories defined explicitly\nThe old version tried to keep configuration simple by adding all necessary repositories when the IntelliJ Platform dependency was resolved. The fixed repository list made Gradle search for dependencies in locations irrelevant to project needs or even unavailable for resolving.\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n\n    intellijPlatform {\n        // use the recommended repository list\n        defaultRepositories()\n\n        // or explicit set\n        jetbrainsIdeInstallers()\n        releases()\n        localPlatformArtifacts()\n        intellijDependencies()\n        // ...\n    }\n\n    maven(\"...\") {\n       authentication {\n           // ...\n       }\n    }\n}\nThe current solution allows using a recommended set of repositories or using only specific elements whenever you don’t need others or decide to replace them with a custom artifactory.\nAll resources as dependencies\nThe solution present in 1.x requested dependencies and tools in the task execution phase – this prevented Gradle from caching the project configuration or task output. This could also result in unsatisfied requests when working in environments with limited network capacity.\nWith the 2.x release, everything required for building, testing, and verifying the plugin is defined as a dependency.\nThe new approach requires explicit declarations of the IntelliJ Platform and all other dependencies:\ndependencies {\n   testImplementation(libs.junit)\n\n   intellijPlatform {\n       intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2023.2.7\")\n       instrumentationTools()\n       pluginVerifier()\n       testFramework(TestFrameworkType.Platform)\n   }\n}\nRelying fully on the Gradle approach for managing dependencies makes it possible to involve caching for every requested resource and avoid resolving dependencies eagerly.\nAdvanced dependency management\nChanges applied to repository and dependency configuration allow involving advanced Gradle techniques, like declaring centralized repositories. All of the project repositories can now be specified within the settings.gradle.kts file, which applies them to all declared project modules.\nimport org.jetbrains.intellij.platform.gradle.extensions.intellijPlatform\n      \nplugins {\n   id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform.settings\") version \"2.0.0\"\n}\n\n\ndependencyResolutionManagement {\n   repositoriesMode = RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS\n\n   repositories {\n       mavenCentral()\n\n       intellijPlatform {\n           defaultRepositories()\n       }\n   }\n}\nFrom now on, the repositories {} block in any build.gradle.kts  is redundant.\nPowerful DSL\nThe new intellijPlatform {} extension replaces the old intellij {} and facilitates the detailed configuration of all relevant plugin configuration values, as well as signing, verifying, and publishing plugins:\nintellijPlatform {\n   pluginConfiguration {\n       version = providers.gradleProperty(\"pluginVersion\")\n       name = \"My Awesome Plugin\"\n\n       description = ...\n       changeNotes = ...\n\n       ideaVersion {\n           sinceBuild = \"223\"\n           untilBuild = \"242.*\"\n       }\n   }\n\n   signing {\n       // ...\n   }\n\n   publishing {\n       // ...\n   }\n\n   pluginVerification {\n       // ...\n   }\n}\nAll extension properties and helper methods accept values passed either eagerly or lazily wrapped with Provider, which is available in the Gradle API. However, the simple property assignment in the Kotlin DSL, introduced in Gradle 8.2, keeps this change transparent.\nIn addition to the root intellijPlatform {} extension, new extensions have been introduced for the repositories {} and dependencies {} blocks. Each of these extensions provides dedicated helpers for applying repositories and dependencies related to the development of plugins for the IntelliJ Platform. This approach offers full control over what is applied to the configuration.\nImproved testing experience\nThe changes in how the IntelliJ Platform and dependencies in bundled and external plugins are applied to the project have opened up new possibilities in testing. You can now create custom run and test tasks targeting different IntelliJ Platform types and versions or plugin sets without changing the IntelliJ Platform version and type used to build the plugin.\nUsing the new intellijPlatformTesting {} extension, you can register tasks of various types and purposes:\nval runPhpStorm by intellijPlatformTesting.runIde.registering {\n   type = IntelliJPlatformType.PhpStorm\n   version = \"2024.2\"\n\n   plugins {\n       plugin(\"pluginId\", \"1.0.0\")\n       disablePlugin(\"bundledPluginId\")\n   }\n}\nThe code above creates a new runPhpStorm task for running PhpStorm 2024.2 locally for manual testing purposes with the pluginId installed from JetBrains Marketplace and the bundledPluginId plugin disabled.\nThis approach helps with running manual or automated tests for different scenarios, such as ones where bundled plugins are disabled or optional plugins are installed.\nMulti-project builds support\nTo address previous issues with multi-project builds, the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin has been restructured into several sub-plugins. These sub-plugins can be applied selectively based on the architecture of your project.\nThis modular approach allows for the application of specific features, such as providing IntelliJ Platform dependencies to a project submodule, without introducing unnecessary tasks.\n\nFor projects using IntelliJ-based IDEs, the main module should always include the org.jetbrains.intellij.platform plugin in its configuration file. In contrast, other submodules should utilize the org.jetbrains.intellij.platform.module plugin. This ensures the proper export of output archives and optimizes the build process. For submodules that require only access to the IntelliJ Platform dependency, the org.jetbrains.intellij.platform.base plugin should be applied.\n\nNew name and requirements\nThis release brings major configuration and conceptual changes. In order to help distinguish the new configuration from the old one, version 2.0 of the plugin has a new ID: org.jetbrains.intellij.platform.\nAnother reason for the name change was confusion of the Gradle IntelliJ Plugin with the Gradle plugin, which is bundled in IntelliJ IDEA and offers actual Gradle integration features. The name “IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin” highlights that it is the “IntelliJ Platform Plugin” for the “Gradle” build system.\nTo make it possible to introduce solutions that address almost all of the issues reported over the last few years, it was necessary to limit support for older versions of the IntelliJ Platform, Gradle, and Java Runtime. IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.0 requires the following minimal versions:\nIntelliJ Platform – 2022.3\nGradle – 8.2\nJava Runtime – 17\nThose constraints helped us focus more on recent IntelliJ Platform versions and developer environments, allowing us to close over 100 reported issues, improve project quality, and cover it with more unit and integration tests.\nThe importance of updating\nIntelliJ IDEA 2024.2 introduces changes to the layout of IntelliJ Platform modules. To use version 2024.2+ of an IntelliJ-based IDE for building plugins, migrating to version 2.0 of the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is essential, as the new layout changes cannot be easily backported to the 1.x branch.\nAdditionally, Android Studio 2024.1 on macOS has discontinued the use of ZIP archives and now only provides DMG installers, which the 1.x version of the Gradle plugin cannot handle.\nAs of the 2.0 release, the development of 1.x is now frozen and no more updates are planned.\nNext steps\nTo start using version 2.0 of the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin, visit the documentation pages at IntelliJ Platform SDK | Tooling | IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.x, where you will find a proper introduction to all of the new features and changes, a migration guide, and examples of various configurations you may be interested in.\nFor projects created with the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template, we advise taking a look at the 2.0.0 pull request applied on top of the obsolete Gradle IntelliJ Plugin 1.x configuration: https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-platform-plugin-template/pull/458/files\nIf you have any issues or requests, please submit them to our GitHub Issues page or the JetBrains Platform Slack.\nTo submit questions or suggestions related to the documentation, please use the feedback form at the bottom of the article.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Airbnb’s Use of A New Flink platform evolved from Apache Hadoop® Yarn\n\nIntroduction\nAt Airbnb, Apache Flink was introduced in 2018 as a supplementary solution for stream processing. It ran alongside Apache Spark™ Streaming for several years before transitioning to become the primary stream processing platform. In this blog post, we will delve into the evolution of Flink architecture at Airbnb and compare our prior Hadoop Yarn platform with the current Kubernetes-based architecture. Additionally, we will discuss the efforts undertaken throughout the migration process and explore the challenges that arose during this journey. In the end we will summarize the impact, learnings along the way and future plans.\nArchitecture Evolution\nThe evolution of Airbnb’s streaming processing architecture based on Apache Flink can be categorized into three distinct phases:\nPhase One: Flink jobs operated on Hadoop Yarn with Apache Airflow serving as the job scheduler.\nAround 2018, several teams at Airbnb adopted Flink as their streaming processing engine, mainly due to its superior low-latency capabilities compared to Spark Streaming. During this period, Flink jobs were running on Hadoop Yarn, and Airflow was employed as the workflow manager for task scheduling and dependency management.\nThe selection of Airflow as the workflow manager was largely influenced by its widespread use in addressing various job scheduling needs, as there were no other user-friendly open-source alternatives readily available at that time. Each team was responsible for handling their Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), job source code, and the requisite dependency JARs. Typically, Flink JAR files were locally built before deployment to Amazon S3.\n\nThe architecture catered to our requirements during that period with a limited range of use cases.\nFrom 2019 onwards, Apache Flink gained significant traction at Airbnb, replacing Spark Streaming as the primary stream processing platform. With the scaling in usage of Flink we encountered various challenges and limitations in this architecture. To begin with, Airflow’s batch-oriented design, relying on polling intervals, did not match Airbnb’s needs, and we experienced significant delays in job start and failure recovery, often causing SLA violations for low-latency use cases. Airflow also caused a singleton issue as duplicate job submissions occasionally occur due to race conditions among Airflow workers and user operations not following expected patterns. Besides, Airflow’s Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structure is complex and does not function well with some of Airbnb’s streaming use cases. We also encountered engineering context mismatch in this architecture: product engineers might find themselves unfamiliar with Apache Airflow and Hadoop, resulting in a steep learning curve when setting up new Apache Flink jobs.\nTo tackle the above technical and operational challenges, we started to explore new possibilities. Our initial step involved replacing Airflow with a customized lightweight streaming job scheduler, marking the inception of Phase Two.\nPhase Two: Flink jobs operated on Hadoop Yarn, with a lightweight streaming job scheduler.\n\nAt a high level, Airflow was replaced by a lightweight streaming job scheduler operating on Kubernetes. The job scheduler contains a master node and a pool of worker nodes:\nThe master node is responsible for managing the metadata of all Flink jobs and ensuring the proper life cycle of each worker node. This includes tasks such as parsing user-provided job configurations, synchronizing metadata and job statuses with Apache Zookeeper™, and ensuring that worker nodes consistently maintain their expected states.\nA worker node is responsible for handling the dependencies and life cycle of a single Flink job. Workers package the necessary dependencies, submit the Flink job to Hadoop Yarn, continuously monitor its status, and in the event of a failure, it triggers an immediate restart.\nThe Phase 2 design resulted in faster turnaround time and reduced downtime during job restarts. It also resolved single point of failure issues with Zookeeper.\nAs usage of Flink grew, we encountered new challenges in Phase Two:\n\nLack of CI/CD: Flink developers had to devise their own version control strategies.\nAbsence of native secrets management: There is no vanilla secrets management on Hadoop Yarn.\nLimited resource and dependency isolation: Each supported Flink version had to be manually preinstalled on the Yarn cluster. While Yarn’s resource queues could provide some level of resource isolation, job-level isolation was absent.\nService Discovery complexity: As more use cases were onboarded, each potentially requiring access to various internal Airbnb services, configuring service access on Yarn proved to be cumbersome. It forced a binary choice between enabling service access for the entire cluster or none at all.\nMonitoring and debugging challenges: Managing and maintaining the logging pipeline and SSH access became non-trivial tasks on a multi-tenant Yarn cluster.\nOngoing complexity and dependencies: Although the Flink job scheduler was lightweight compared to Airflow, it introduced additional complexities.\n\nPhase Three (current state): Flink jobs run on Kubernetes, and the job scheduler is eliminated.\nDeploying Flink on Kubernetes allows direct Flink deployment on a running Kubernetes cluster. With this integration we can explore enabling efficient autoscaling and the Kubernetes operator to simplify the management of Flink jobs and clusters.\nFlink on Kubernetes offers several advantages over Hadoop Yarn addressing the above challenges:\n\nDeveloper experience: Standardized by integrating with the existing CI/CD systems.\nSecrets Management: With Flink on Kubernetes, each Flink job can securely store its own secrets within the pods. This provides a more secure way to manage sensitive information.\nIsolated Environment: Jobs running on Flink on Kubernetes benefit from isolation at both the resource and dependency levels. Each job can run on its dedicated Flink version if supported by its image, allowing for better management of dependencies.\nEnhanced Monitoring: Integration with Airbnb’s pre-defined logging and metric sidecars on Kubernetes simplifies setup and improves monitoring. This enables detailed insights into individual pods and rate limiting for logging per pod, making it easier to track and troubleshoot issues.\nService Discovery: Flink jobs now adhere to Airbnb’s standardized approach for service discovery, using the cluster mesh. This ensures consistent and reliable communication between services.\nSimplified SSH access: Users with the appropriate permissions can now SSH into the Flink pod without the need for an SSH tunnel. This provides greater flexibility and control over SSH permissions per job.\n\nAdditionally, we’ve observed an increasing level of Kubernetes support and adoption within the Flink community, which increased our confidence in running Flink on Kubernetes.\nIt’s worth mentioning that Kubernetes brings its own risks and limitations. For instance, a single Flink task manager failover can lead to the pause of the entire job process. This can pose issues in scenarios with frequent node rotations within Kubernetes and large jobs deployed with hundreds of task managers. For context, node rotation on Kubernetes is performed to ensure the operability and stability of the cluster. It involves replacing existing nodes with new ones, typically with updated configurations or to perform maintenance tasks, with the goals of applying host configuration changes, maintaining node balance and enhancing operational efficiency. In comparison, node rotations on Yarn occur less frequently, so the impact on job availability is less significant. We will explore how we are mitigating these challenges in the Future Work section.\nComponents Deep Dive\nBelow is an overview of our current architecture:\n\nTo provide a better understanding of the system, below is a deep dive of the five primary components, as well as how users interact with them when setting up a new Flink job:\n\nJob configurations: This serves as an abstraction layer over Kubernetes and CI/CD components, providing Flink users with a simplified interface for creating Flink application templates. It shields users from the complexities of the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure. Flink users define the core specifications of their Flink job via a configuration file. This includes critical information like the entrypoint class name, job parallelism, and the necessary ingress services and sinks.\n\nImage management: This component involves the pre-construction of Flink base images, which are bundled with essential dependencies required to access Airbnb resources. These images are stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry and can be readily deployed with user Jars or further customized to meet specific user needs.\n\nCI/CD: By introducing a few customizations to support Flink’s stateful deployment, we’ve integrated Flink with our existing CI/CD system, providing a standardized version control and continuous delivery experience. Flink jobs are deployed within Kubernetes, each residing in its distinct namespace to ensure isolation and effective administration.\n\nFlink portal: an API service that offers essential features for managing the states of Flink jobs. These features include stopping a Flink job with a savepoint and querying completed checkpoints on Amazon S3. Additionally, it provides a self-service UI portal, enabling users to monitor and check the status of their jobs. Users also gain access to critical job state management functionalities, empowering them to either initiate the job from a bootstrapped savepoint or resume it from a previous checkpoint.\n\nFlink job runtime: Each Flink job is deployed as an independent application cluster on Kubernetes. To ensure fault tolerance and state storage, Zookeeper, ETCD, and Amazon S3 are utilized. Additionally, pre-configured sidecar containers accompany the Flink containers to provide support for critical functions such as logging, metrics, DNS, and more. A service mesh is employed to facilitate communication between Flink jobs and other microservices.\n\nImpact\nImproved Developer Velocity\nOnboarding Flink jobs is faster, where our developers noted that it takes hours instead of days, and developers can focus more on their application logic.\nImprovement in Flink Job Availability and Latency\nThe architecture of Flink on Kubernetes improves job availability and scheduling latency by eliminating certain components of the Flink client and job scheduler found in Flink on Yarn.\nCost Savings in Infrastructure\nThe streamlining of Flink infrastructure complexity and the removal of certain components, such as the job scheduler, have resulted in cost savings in our infrastructure. Additionally, by running Flink jobs on a shared Kubernetes cluster at Airbnb, we could potentially improve the overall cost efficiency of our company’s infrastructure.\nFuture Work\nImprovement in Job Availability\nIn the Flink world, node rotations in Kubernetes can cause job restarts and result in downtime. While Flink itself can recover from job restarts without data loss, the potential downtime and availability impact may be unfavorable for highly latency-sensitive applications. To address this, there are a few approaches we are evaluating.\n\nReducing the number of node rotations to minimize job restarts.\nFaster job recovery.\n\nEnable Job Autoscaling\nWith the introduction of Reactive Mode in Flink 1.13, users can dynamically adjust the parallelism of their jobs without the need for a job restart. This job auto scaling feature can enhance job stability and cost efficiency. In the future we could enable autoscaling for Flink Kubernetes workloads by leveraging system metrics (such as CPU usage) and Flink metrics (such as backpressure), to determine the appropriate parallelism.\nFlink Kubernetes Operator\nThe Flink Kubernetes Operator utilizes Custom Resources and functions as a controller to manage the entire production lifecycle of Flink applications. By leveraging the operator, we can streamline the operation and deployment processes for Flink jobs. It provides better control over deployment and lifecycle of jobs, and an out of box solution for autoscaling and auto tuning.\nConclusion\nTo summarize, the migration of Airbnb’s streaming processing architecture based on Apache Flink from Hadoop Yarn to Kubernetes has been a significant milestone in enhancing our streaming data processing capabilities. This transition has resulted in a more streamlined and user-friendly experience for Flink developers. By overcoming challenges that were complex to address on Yarn, we have laid the foundation for more efficient and effective streaming data processing.\nAs we look ahead, we are committed to further refining our approach and resolving any remaining challenges. We are enthusiastic about the ongoing growth and potential of Apache Flink within our company, and we anticipate continued innovation and improvement in the future.\nIf this kind of work sounds appealing to you, check out our open roles — we’re hiring!\nAppreciations\nThe Flink on Kubernetes platform would not have been possible without cross-functional and cross-org collaborators as well as leadership support.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "201x년 스쿼드의 경험은 고통이었다. 첫 제품을 만들어야하는 스타트업이 3명의 디자이너와 4명의 개발자를 5개의 스쿼드에 나눠서 배치했다. 그럼에도 멋있는 조직도를 갖고 싶은 욕심일 뿐 10여명의 제품팀에게 무슨 의미가 있겠냐고 안일하게 생각했다. 그러나, 조직구조가 구성원들에게 지대한 영향을 준다는 것을 깨닫는 계기가 되었다. 그리고 2020년 스포티파이 출신의 직원들이 스포티파이 조직 모델은 실패했으나 회사 이미지와 채용을 위해 비밀로 했다고 고백했다.\n참고: 스포티파이의 ‘Scaling Agile’ 백서 (Scaling Agile @ Spotify)\n참고: Spotify의 Squad 팀 모델은 실패였다. (Failed #SquadGoals)\n그럼에도 불구하고 스타트업들은 여전히 스쿼드 조직 구조에 집착한다. 하지만, 그것들은 대부분 스포티파이 모델도 아니고 매트릭스 조직도 아니고 애자일은 더더욱 아니다. 스쿼드는 구성원들이 제품을 위해 미친듯이 달리는 멋진 애자일 조직처럼 보일 수 있다. 그러나, 현실 세계에서 운영을 시작하는 순간 인간의 정신 모델과 심각하게 충돌한다. 상기 링크의 “Spotify의 Squad 팀 모델은 실패였다.”에 포함된 원인 분석은 매우 피상적이다. 스포티파이 모델에는 그 이상의 근본적인 문제가 있다.\n뜯어 볼수록 괴랄한 이 조직 모델이 왜 정상적으로 동작하기 힘든지에 대해 분석해보고, 실패라는 공식적인 고백에도 불구하고 여전히 왜 스쿼드에 집착하는지 고찰해본다.\n1. 대기업의 사업부 조직 모델이란?\n2. 스포티파이 조직 모델과 스쿼드란?\n3. 왜 스포티파이 조직 모델인가?\n4. 왜 스포티파이 조직 모델은 동작하지 않는가?\n5. 왜 스쿼드 조직 모델에 집착하는가?\n6. 그럼에도 스포티파이 조직 모델을 성공시키고 싶다면?\n2012년 백서가 발표된 후 한국 스타트업계에서 스포티파이 모델의 스쿼드는 종교와 같이 되었다. 아무리 준비를 철저히 해도 스포티파이 모델은 한번만 시행해보면 단번에 문제들이 속출한다. 심지어 스쿼드를 부르짓는 대부분은 백서도 읽어본 적이 없고 진짜 스포티파이 모델이 뭔지도 모른다. 스포티파이 모델에 성공했다고 자평하는 곳들이 있다고? 뜯어보면 스포티파이 모델에서 일부 단어만 차용했을 뿐 사업부 모델에 더 가깝다.\n1. 대기업의 사업부 조직 모델이란?\n\n과거에 몸 담았던 삼성전자를 예시로 전통적인 기업들의 사업부 조직 구조를 설명한다.\n삼성전자는 전세계 26만명 이상의 임직원들이 소속된 글로벌 대기업으로 4개의 부문을 갖고 있으며 각 부문 산하에 여러 개의 사업부와 조직을 갖고 있다. 부회장이 CEO를 맡고, 각 부문의 최고 책임자는 부회장 또는 사장 직함을 갖고 있으며, 사업부의 최고 책임자들은 대부분 사장 직함을 갖고 있다.\n부문은 사업부의 집합이다. 규모가 작다면 부문이 없을 수 있다. 삼성전자 규모에서는 시너지가 나는 사업부들을 하나로 묶고 부문 하위에 사업부들을 지원할 수 있는 공통 조직들을 배치한다. 구성은 다음과 같다.\n\nDX (Device eXperience) 부문: 완제품\nDS (Device Solutions) 부문: 반도체\nSDC (Samsung Display Corporation): 디스플레이(패널)\nHARMAN: 음향기기\n\n사업부는 하나 또는 공통적인 성격을 갖는 사업들을 하나로 묶는 단위이다. 예를 들어 VD사업부의 경우 디스플레이와 거실이 키워드이다. 원래 TV와 모니터 사업을 하고 있었으며, 보르도TV의 성공 이후 오디오 사업을 통합하면서 TV와 홈씨어터를 묶어 시너지를 노렸다. 삼성전자의 사업부 중 아래는 DX 부문의 사업부만 나열했다.\n\nVD 사업부: TV, 모니터, 오디오\nDA 사업부: 가전제품\nMX 사업부: 휴대폰 및 모바일기기\n의료기기 사업부\n네트워크 사업부: B2B 통신 인프라 장비\n\n그리고 사업부에 속하지 않은 수많은 조직이 있다. 아래는 DX부문과 DS부문의 일부 조직들이다. 사업부에서 현재의 사업에 집중하면서 병행이 원활하지 못한 일이나 여러 사업부에서 공통적으로 필요하여 한 곳에서 진행하는 것이 효율적인 일들을 진행한다. 또한, 일부 조직들은 부문을 넘어 삼성전자 전체에 영향을 주기도 한다.\n\n생산기술연구소\n디자인경영센터\n글로벌마케팅실\n경영혁신센터\n반도체연구소\n설비기술연구소\n\nTF는 특수한 목적을 이루기 위해 적임자들을 다양한 조직에서 차출하여 한시적으로 활동한 후 목적을 달성하면 원래의 조직으로 복귀하도록 하는 조직 형태이다.\n2. 스포티파이 조직 모델과 스쿼드란?\nScaling Agile @ Spotify\n스포티파이 모델은 스쿼드와 챕터라는 두 개의 큰 축을 중심으로 하는 매트릭스 조직이다. 다수의 스쿼드 및 챕터들이 바둑판의 선처럼 격자 모양으로 구성되며, 스쿼드의 구성원은 동시에 챕터의 구성원이다.\n스쿼드는 비지니스 목표를 위한 목적 조직이다. 스쿼드 안에서 PO/PM/UX/SWE 등과 같은 다양한 직군이 하나의 팀으로 긴밀하게 협력한다. 비지니스 중심이기 때문에 PO가 mini-CEO처럼 동작한다고 설명한다. 그리고 복수의 스쿼드 묶음은 트라이브다.\n챕터는 전문성을 기준으로 하는 기능 조직이다. 그로스챕터, 서버챕터, 모바일챕터, UX챕터 같은 식으로 구분된다. 스쿼드가 비지니스에 집중한다면 챕터는 직군들이 스스로의 직무 생산성을 혁신하는 것을 목적으로 한다.\n또한, 다양한 직군들이 함께 해결해야 하지만 스쿼드의 성격은 아닐 때, 길드라는 단위로 활동한다.\n3. 왜 스포티파이 조직 모델인가?\n스포티파이 모델이 관심을 받은 이유는 애자일 그룹이 열망하는 매트릭스 조직에 대하여 명확한 실행 가이드라인을 제공하고 있기 때문이다. 전통적인 조직은 목적 조직 또는 기능 조직 중 선택해왔고, 양쪽 모두 각자의 문제들을 겪고 있으며 애자일 커뮤니티에서는 이러한 한계를 매트릭스 조직으로 풀고자 고민해왔다.\n목적 조직의 경우 비지니스 기준의 사일로 현상을 피할 수 없다. 회사에서의 평가는 각자가 속한 조직의 성과에 연동된다. 그렇다면 모든 직군은 결국 단기적인 비지니스 성과에 의해 그들의 가치를 평가 받는다. 이런 기준에서는 매출을 직접 견인하는 영업의 입김이 가장 강해질 수 있다. 최악의 경우는 영업이 고객사에서 원하는 것은 다 해줄 수 있다고 큰소리 치고 들어와서 제품팀을 닥달하며 경영진에게 제품팀이 무능해서 자신이 어렵게 가져온 매출 기회를 날려버리고 있다고 정치질을 하고, 제품팀은 죽어라 일해도 고운 소리 못듣는다. 이런 상황이 되면 제품팀은 비지니스 결정에 멱살 잡혀서 끌려다닐 수 밖에 없다. 당연히 제품의 품질이 좋을 수 없고 구성원들의 사기가 높을 수 없다. 기업의 체질이나 잠재력이 발전하기도 힘들다. 우리나라 중소기업에서 흔하게 일어나는 일이고 나도 많이 겪어봤다.\n기능 조직의 경우 두 가지 문제 중 하나가 발생할 수 있다. 우선 리더(ex: CTO)가 무조건 비지니스 편에 선다면 외부 조직의 요청에 의해 파도 위의 가랑잎처럼 휩쓸리며 제대로 책임을 다 할 수 없게 되며 기능조직으로 운영하는 의미가 없게 된다. 반면에 리더가 회사의 목표보다 자신의 조직과 직군의 열망에 더 민감하게 반응한다면, 각 직군은 회사의 가치와 괴리되어 자신들의 이상향과 예술적 목표를 달성하기 위해 다른 조직과 끊임없는 마찰을 빚게 된다.\n두 극단의 균형을 잡는 것은 어렵지만, 해낸다면 회사는 현재의 성과와 미래의 성장 동력을 모두 확보할 수 있다. 우리나라의 오래된 대기업들은 대규모 사업부로 외형을 분할 한 뒤 내부를 기능 조직으로 구성하며, 사업부 외부에 공통역량 및 장기적인 비전을 위한 조직을 별도로 구성한다.\n이러한 상황에서 스포티파이 모델이 주장하는 매트릭스 조직은 마치 두 마리 토끼를 다 잡는 것처럼 현혹한다. 스쿼드라는 목적 조직과 챕터라는 기능 조직이 동시에 동일한 레벨로 존재한다. 게다가 하나의 사업부에는 수십에서 수천명이 근무하지만, 하나의 스쿼드는 직군별로 한두명씩만 있어도 시작할 수 있다. 그래서 스타트업계는 적은 인원으로도 체계적인 조직을 꾸밀 수 있는 것처럼 보이는 스포티파이 모델에 열광한다.\n4. 왜 스포티파이 조직 모델은 동작하지 않는가?\nEverybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\n누구나 그럴싸한 계획은 가지고 있다. 처맞기 전까지는.\n- Mike Tyson (마이크 타이슨)\n스포티파이 모델은 트라이브, 스쿼드, 챕터, 길드라는 단어를 사용한다. 그런데, 각 조직의 목적이 대기업의 사업부 모델의 조직들과 완벽하게 동일하다.\n\n트라이브 = 부문 : 다수의 사업부들을 묶은 상위 집합이다.\n스쿼드 = 사업부 : 단기적인 성과를 위해 독립된 사업을 진행하는 조직이다.\n챕터 = 사업부에 속하지 않은 연구소/센터/실/총괄 : 다수의 사업부들과 전사에 공통적으로 필요한 역량을 개발하고 제공하여 전문성과 생산성을 높인다. 또한 회사에 일관성을 부여한다.\n길드 = TF : 범 조직적인 목적을 위해 다양한 능력의 인재들을 모아 한시적으로 구성되고 목적을 이루면 해체된다.\n\n차이점은 전통적인 조직들은 각 단위가 독립된 그룹인 반면 스포티파이 모델의 조직 단위들은 모두 겹쳐져 있다. 사람이 조직과 일을 인지하는 방식을 이해를 한다면 스포티파이 모델과 매트릭스 조직의 태생적 한계를 이해할 수 있다.\n첫째, 한번에 하나씩\n사람은 여러 개의 목표를 동시에 처리할 수 없다. 여러 개의 목표가 주어진다면 보통은 우왕좌왕하며 모든 목표를 놓치게 된다. 유능한 사람이 되려면 우선순위를 정하고 하나씩 목표를 달성하라고 조언하는 이유이다. 많은 사람들이 우선순위 선정과 순차적 실행에 어려움을 느낀다. 때문에 체계적인 조직과 업무 프로세스 그리고 리더의 도움이 필요한 것이다.\n스포티파이 모델은 한사람에게 스쿼드와 챕터의 책임을 모두 준다. 두 조직의 목표는 완전히 다르기 때문에 우선순위를 가늠하기 어렵다. 백서에 의하면 스쿼드의 PO는 mini-CEO로 강조될 정도로 많은 권한을 위임받는다. 반면, 챕터 리드에 대해서는 인상적인 표현이 없다. 즉, 스포티파이 모델은 매트릭스 조직이라고 하지만 명백하게 스쿼드를 중심으로 동작한다. 그래서 개인의 평가는 스쿼드의 성과와 기여에 좌우된다. 따라서 대부분의 구성원은 내면의 충돌에서 스쿼드의 업무를 최우선으로 인식하며 챕터와 길드의 목표는 뒤로 미룰 수 밖에 없다. 일부 생산성과 일관성에 민감한 구성원은 스쿼드의 목표를 뒤로 미루고 챕터에 더 관심을 둘 수도 있다. 이 경우에도 여전히 스쿼드에 대한 책임은 함께 가져간다. 이와 더불어 길드에도 포함된다면? 한 사람에게 도저히 병행할 수 없는 세 개의 책임이 부여된다. 만약, 길드의 구성원이 사업 목표나 전문성보다도 복잡하고 형이상학적인 전사적 문제 해결에 관심이 많다면 길드의 목표에 가장 집중할 수 있다. 그러나 역시 스쿼드와 챕터에 대한 책임이 사라지는 것은 아니다.\n결과적으로 스포티파이 모델은 구성원의 강점과 관심사에 관계없이 스쿼드, 챕터, 길드의 책임을 동시에 한 사람에게 부여한다. 셋 중 가장 막중한 책임은 스쿼드의 단기적인 사업 성과이다. 만약, 구성원의 성향이나 능력이 챕터나 길드에 더 부합하다면 PO와의 갈등과 낮은 평가를 감내해야 한다. 다양한 사람들이 자신의 강점을 기반으로 서로를 보완하며 조직을 발전시켜나가야 한다고 생각한다면, 성향과 능력에 관계없이 모두를 스쿼드에 가두고 챕터나 길드 활동을 병행하는 형태는 시너지가 나지 않는다.\n대기업 모델에서는 현재의 사업 성과를 우선하는 사업부와 공통 역량을 관리하고 미래를 준비하는 각종 연구소/실/센터/총괄이 서로를 보완한다. 또한, TF의 경우 구성원들의 소속은 기존 조직이지만, TF 활동 기간에는 원래의 업무에서 분리되어 TF의 목표에만 집중하고 목표 달성 후 기존 조직으로 복귀하는 형태를 통해 한번에 하나의 목표에만 집중하도록 강제한다.\n대기업 모델의 약점은 소통의 질이다. 비사업부에서 사업화에 대한 긴밀한 이해가 없는 경우 현실성 없는 결과들이 도출되거나 각 조직들의 이해상충 문제가 발생한다. 예를 들어 연구소의 아이템이 사업부에 이관되는 경우 경영진은 이미 개발된 기능을 제품에 탑재하는 과정만 기대하지만, 종종 양산에 대한 고려가 부족하여 컨셉만 취하고 처음부터 재개발하기도 한다. 또는 이미 잘 사용하고 있는 환경을 전사 조직의 공용화 추진을 위해 재구축하고 안정화하느라 긴시간 고통 받기도 한다. 이런 문제를 해결하기 위해서는 매우 긴밀한 소통과 이해를 바탕으로 협력해야한다.\n매트릭스 조직의 약점은 형태 그 자체이다. 애자일이라는 수식이 무색하게 모두에게 획일적으로 상충하는 책임들을 부여하여 고도의 자기 관리를 강요한다. 조직 구조가 구성원을 도와야 하는데, 거꾸로 유능한 사람만 살아남을 수 있도록 혼란속에 밀어넣고 압박하는 것이다. 그러므로 사용하지 않는 것이 답이다.\n둘째, PO는 리더가 아니다\n스포티파이 모델은 PO가 각 스쿼드의 mini-CEO가 된다고 어필한다. 하지만, CEO는 조직을 통솔하는 리더이지 제품 책임자가 아니다. 실리콘밸리 CEO의 다수는 엔지니어 출신이다. MS의 암흑기인 스티브 발머 시대나 보잉의 추락은 숫자만으로 경영하는 비지니스맨들의 공적이다. 그러나 엔지니어가 비지니스맨보다 CEO에 적합하다는 말은 아니다. 인텔의 미래를 삭제한 브라이언 크르자니치는 엔지니어 출신이며, 스티브잡스 사후 애플이 세계 제일의 자리를 굳건하게 지키는 것은 OM(Operation Management) 전문가였던 팀 쿡의 공적이다. 즉, 성공적인 CEO의 자질은 특정 직군에서만 나타나는 것이 아니다. 그러나 스포티파이 모델은 mini-CEO라는 막중한 표현을 만들고 PO만 수행할 수 있도록 한다. CEO는 사업의 성과만 아니라 조직의 건강과 미래를 함께 책임져야하므로, 스쿼드 조직은 PO가 아니라 리더가 이끌어야 한다.\n대기업 모델에서는 사업부가 스쿼드와 동일한 성격이다. 그리고 사업부의 수장을 맡는 사장들은 매우 다양한 배경을 갖고 있다. 내가 재직하던 당시에 VD사업부의 경영진은 다수가 엔지니어 출신이었다.\n대기업 모델의 약점은 리더를 선임하는 시스템의 품질에 달려있지만, 스포티파이 모델처럼 룰에 근본적인 문제를 내포하고 있다고 보기는 어렵다.\n즉, mini-CEO라는 자리는 리더의 자질과 능력이 있는 사람에게 맡겨야 하며, PO는 리더가 이끄는 조직의 일원으로 그 전문성을 발휘하는 것이 옳다.\n셋째, 의사결정의 불균형\n회사 내부에는 경영진으로 불리는 수많은 CxO들이 있다. 경영진은 자신의 전문분야에서 커리어를 쌓아 회사의 경영에 기여하고 각 직군을 통솔한다.\n스포티파이 모델에서 스쿼드의 PO는 mini-CEO이고 PO는 CPO의 통솔을 받는다. 이에 따라 제품 조직의 전권을 CPO가 갖으며 다른 CxO들을 챕터 리드로서 조언자의 역할에 머물 수 밖에 없다. 전통적으로 CxO들이 함께 협력하는 것과 대조적이다. 과거에 스쿼드 조직 때문에 CMO(Chief Marketing Officer)와 CLO(Chief Legal Officer), CX(Customer eXperience)리더가 CPO에게 가로막혀 손가락만 빨며 발을 동동 굴렀던 경험이 있다. 심지어 CTO의 결정을 독단적으로 모두 폐기하고 비공식적으로 각각의 엔지니어에게 개별적인 기술적 지시를 하기도 했다. 스쿼드 조직에서 CPO의 영향력이 얼마나 막강한지 알 수 있었다.\n이 문제를 해결하려면 스포티파이의 백서 뒤에 감추어진 고도의 전문적 의사 결정 구조를 직접 디자인하고 운영하며 개선해야 한다. 다만, 애초에 실패한 조직 구조를 잘 동작하도록 백서에서 생략된 부분을 유추한다는 것은 넌센스이다.\n5. 왜 스쿼드 조직 모델에 집착하는가?\n전통적인 대기업의 사업부 모델은 글로벌 기업들을 지탱하고 성장시켜 왔지만, 스포티파이 모델은 왜 처음부터 정상적으로 동작할 수 없었는지에 대해 비교하고 분석해 보았다.\n이제 2020년의 실패 고백에도 불구하고 왜 여전히 스타트업들이 스쿼드 모델에 집착하는지 설명한다.\n첫째, 정답 찾기\n학창시절의 시험들은 언제나 정답이 있다. 출제자의 의도를 파악해서 준비를 한다. 하지만, 세상은 그렇게 단순하지 않고 정답보다 선택으로 가득하다. 그럼에도 사람들은 스스로 문제를 정의하고 해결하기 보다는 깔끔한 정답을 찾아 헤매인다.\n그럼 스쿼드는 왜 조직 구조의 정답이 되었을까? 이유는 두 가지, 애자일이고 알려진 정답이 그것 뿐이니까. 전통적인 조직 구조에서는 앞에서 언급한 부문과 사업부만 있는 것이 아니라 부/과/실/그룹/팀/파트 등 다양한 명칭의 하위 조직이 있으며 회사마다 그 구성이 전부 상이하다. 우리는 이 조직들의 책임 범위 및 포함 관계를 명확히 그릴 수 있을까? 어느 명칭이 상위 조직이고 하위 조직일까? 어떤 명칭은 반드시 있어야 하고 어떤 명칭은 생략이 가능할까? 각 조직의 규모는 몇 명 정도일까? 어떤 명칭들이 같은 그룹이고 아닐까? 각 조직에는 어떤 사람이 리더가 되어야 할까? 정답은 없다. 룰이 전혀 없는 것은 아니지만, 회사마다 모두 다르다. 게다가 이러한 체계적인 조직을 갖춘 회사들은 수백에서 수십만명이 속한 큰 규모이다. 십여명에서 수십명 규모의 스타트업을 위한 조직 레퍼런스가 아니다.\n그에 반해 스쿼드는 쉽고 명확하다. 다 생략하고 스쿼드와 PO라는 단어만 있어도 된다. 내가 하고 싶은 일이 있다면 스쿼드를 만들고 사람들을 나열한다. 그리고 PO를 리더로 임명한다. 전부 스쿼드니까 수평조직처럼 보인다. 스쿼드는 스타트업 커뮤니티에 알려진 대표적인 애자일 조직 구조이며 가장 성공적이라고 주장하는 매트릭스 조직 구조이다. 2020년에 실패를 고백했다고? 알게 뭐람. 여전히 모두들 스쿼드를 좋아하고 많은 스타트업들이 스쿼드 조직이라고 자랑한다.\nIT업계에게 이런 정답이 몇 가지 있다. 스포티파이 모델의 스쿼드 조직을 만든다. 애자일하게 2주 단위 스크럼을 한다. 구글의 OKR을 도입하고, 넷플릭스처럼 컬처덱을 만든다. 수평조직이기 때문에 이름이나 별명을 부르며 심지어 반말도 한다. 솔직한 피드백을 한다며 막말이 오가고, 피어리뷰를 해서 동료들이 너를 싫어한다고 말한다. 올핸즈 미팅으로 투명한 소통을 한다고 주장한다. 아마존의 제프베조스처럼 주주서한을 보내며, 빅테크들처럼 MSA를 한다. 시니어 백엔드는 대용량 데이터와 대규모 트래픽 경험이 있어야 한다. 완전히 상이한 문화와 조직 구조를 갖는 다수의 회사들에서 유명한 단어들만 가져와 담는다. 프랑켄슈타인의 탄생이다. 심지어 가이드는 전혀 따르지 않으면서 단어만 사용한다.\n둘째, 조직 관리의 편리함\n스쿼드가 동작하기 힘든 이유로 PO가 리더가 되면서 의사 결정이 CPO에게 집중되어 다양한 직군의 리더들이 의사 결정에 균형을 잡기 힘들기 때문이라는 것을 앞서 언급했다. 반면에 창업자(또는 CEO)는 조직 관리가 엄청나게 편해진다.\n스쿼드 모델 이전에는 기능조직의 리더들이 모여서 목적을 위해 각 직군들이 어떻게 협력하고 자원을 분배할지 긴밀하게 논의했다. 실행 타당성에 대해서도 직군 리더들의 의견을 청취하고 협의하고 타협해야 했다. 실무자들이 움직이기 위해서는 직군 리더들의 검토와 지시가 필요했다.\n그러나 스쿼드 모델이라고 주장하는 조직 구조를 차용하면 CEO는 CPO에게만 지시하면 된다. 그리고 CPO는 PO에게 지시하면 된다. 전문적인 부분에 대한 검토는 스쿼드 내부에서 이루어지며 각 직군은 mini-CEO인 PO를 거역하기 어렵다. 스쿼드 외부의 직군 전문가의 의견은 참고사항일 뿐 PO의 지시가 우선한다. 애자일 매트릭스 조직의 대표주자인 스포티파이 모델이 사업 성과를 최우선으로 하는 완벽한 수직 명령 조직을 만들어 내는 마법을 부린다.\n이로써 CEO는 천상천하 유아독존이 되며, CPO는 일인지상 만인지하의 위치를 획득한다. 실제로 스쿼드 모델을 가장 많이 거론하는 사람들이 스타트업의 CEO와 CPO들이다. 이 중에는 CEO보다 더 CEO처럼 행동하는 CPO도 있다.\n셋째, 멋있어 보이는 조직\n꼭 스쿼드 모델을 사용하지 않는 회사라고 하더라도 잦은 빈도로 볼 수 있는 모습 중 하나가 인적 규모 대비 조직을 지나치게 잘게 자른다는 것이다. 아마 체계적으로 조직을 운영한다는 자기만족과 착각 때문인 것 같다.\n조직 구조는 분업과 협업을 위해 R&R과 관계를 명확히 보여야 한다. 구성원들은 협업을 위해 그룹을 만들며 분업을 위해 그룹의 책임과 권한을 정의하고 다시 그룹간의 협업 관계를 명확하게 한다. 풀어서 말하면 특정 목표나 전문성을 위해 시너지가 나는 사람들끼리 그룹으로 함께 실무를 하고 실무적 권한과 강점이 침해당하지 않도록 독립성을 존중하며 독립된 그룹들이 어떻게 협력해야 하는지 소통 방법을 고도화한 결과가 조직 구조라는 것이다.\n그런데 한국의 스타트업 조직도의 중심에는 사람이 없다. 조직도의 레이아웃은 회사의 사정과 부푼 희망에 따라 그려지며, 그 후에 사람들의 이름을 네모 상자 안에 적는다. 그 결과 자신들이 왜 이런 이름의 조직에 속했는지 혼란스러워 하는 사람들이 속출하고 조직들 사이에 불통의 영역이 광범위하게 발생하면서 업무 마비에 가까운 혼란이 발생한다. 스쿼드 모델은 이런 기준에서 그리기 매우 쉽다. 사업을 구분하여 스쿼드라는 상자를 그리고 각 직군을 1/n로 상자 안에 이름을 적으면 나름 짜임새 있는 조직처럼 보이는 조직도가 완성된다.\n6. 그럼에도 스쿼드 조직 모델을 성공시키고 싶다면?\n첫째, 독립적으로 일 할 수 있는 최소 인원이 하나의 스쿼드이다.\n대부분의 스타트업은 스쿼드를 먼저 만들고 사람을 스쿼드에 분배한다. 그래서는 하나의 스쿼드에 필요한 인적 구성이 만족되지 않는다. 이때 필패의 지름길은 한 명을 복수의 스쿼드에 소속시키는 것이다. 반드시 독립적으로 서비스 및 제품을 책임질 수 있는 인적 구성을 한 후 스쿼드라고 이름 붙이고 서비스를 할당한다.\n만약, 하고 싶은 서비스의 수가 스쿼드 수보다 많다면? 하나의 스쿼드에 복수의 서비스를 배분하고 우선순위를 조정해라. 가장 중요한 명제는 스쿼드가 하나의 서비스를 독립적으로 책임질 수 있다는 것이다. 구성원이 다른 스쿼드의 일을 겸직하느라 하나의 스쿼드에 집중할 수 없다면 반드시 망한다.\n또한, 스쿼드의 각 직군에는 스스로 일을 분석하고 의사 결정이 가능한 시니어가 최소한 한명은 있어야 한다. 그렇지 않으면 주니어만 있는 직군은 비전문가인 다른 시니어 직군에게 휘둘려 일이 좌초하고 팀워크가 손상될 수 있다.\n둘째, mini-CEO는 잊고 매니저를 두라.\nPO는 직군이지 직책이 아니다. 조직을 이끄는 리더는 직책이며 리더십이 가장 중요하다. 스쿼드를 결집시키고 의사 결정을 조율할 수 있는 적임자가 리더가 되어야 한다. 그리고 스쿼드 리더는 CPO가 아니라 경영진의 협의체 및 CEO와 투명하게 소통하며 특정 직군이 아닌 회사의 비전과 골에 얼라인되어야 한다. 따라서 PO가 mini-CEO라는 명제는 잊고, 팀의 전반적인 상황을 돌볼 수 있는 매니저를 두는 것이 낫다.\n셋째, 챕터에는 스쿼드에 소속되지 않은 별동대가 필요하다.\n스포티파이 모델은 한 명에게 스쿼드와 챕터의 의무를 중임시킨다고 말했다. 따라서, 챕터가 원활하게 동작하기 위해서는 정기적인 챕터 활동과 더불어 스쿼드에 속하지 않으면서 챕터의 의무를 다하고 스쿼드에 속한 챕터원들에게 도움을 줄 수 있는 별동대가 필요하다.\n“Spotify의 Squad 팀 모델은 실패였다.”의 회고에서 mini-CEO와 균형을 맞출 mini-CTO가 필요했다고 반성했다. 나는 동의하지 않는다. CEO나 CTO의 자질은 흔하지 않다. 좋은 TPM이나 테크리더 채용도 어려운데, 스쿼드마다 mini-CTO가 있다는 것은 불가능하다. 챕터의 리더들이 별동대를 이끌고 스쿼드에 속한 챕터원들을 지원하거나 전사적인 업무를 처리하는 것이 현실적이다.\n이 모든 것을 만족시킨다면 …\n결국 스포티파이 조직 모델이 아닌 사업부 조직 모델이 완성된다.\n이제 스쿼드는 그만!!\n지금까지 왜 스포티파이 모델이 유행하는지, 그러나 왜 잘 동작하기 힘든지에 대해 설명해 보았다. 우리가 애자일이나 스쿼드라는 단어를 필요로 하는 가장 큰 이유는 성공하고 싶기 때문이다. 그러나 아이러니하게도 가장 성공한 빅테크들(구글, 마이크로소프트, 아마존, 페이스북, 애플 등)은 그런 단어를 사용하지 않고 관심도 없다.\nLG전자 코딩전문가들이 실리콘밸리의 유명한 기업들을 탐방하고 한국인 개발자들과 대화를 갖는 기회가 있었다. 페이스북의 개발자들과 만났을 때 질문했다. “페이스북은 어떻게 회사에 애자일 문화를 잘 정착시킬 수 있었습니까?” 그러자 한 명이 옆 사람을 툭툭치며 ‘애자일이 뭐야?’라고 물었다. 그러자 옆 사람이 ‘우리 아침마다 스탠드업 미팅하잖아. 그게 애자일이야.’라고 답했다. 우리는 크게 당황했다.\n우리 주위에는 언제나 문제가 끊이지 않는다. 이런 문제를 해결하는 방법은 인터넷에서 유행하는 무언가에 기대는 것이 아니다. 문제를 탐색하고 발견하고 관찰하고 분석해서 원인을 제거하고 재발을 방지해야 한다. 매우 힘든 일이다. 그러나 해야만하고 해내야한다. 인터넷의 베스트 프랙티스는 일종의 간접적인 PR이고 세일즈다. 그래서 맥락을 요약하고 과정을 생략하고 실패를 숨긴다. 따라서 그대로 믿고 따른다면 큰 곤경에 빠질 수 있다.\n많은 사람들이 소규모 스타트업에는 베이스캠프의 Shape Up을 추천한다. 조직 모델은 아니지만 스쿼드와 스크럼보다 필드에서 잘 동작한다고 평가된다.\n최근 개발자 채용 JD가 스쿼드라는 단어는 없으나 챕터라는 표현을 두드러지게 사용하고 있다. 그냥 개발팀이나 개발조직이라고 말하는 것이 직관적이고 누구나 이해할 수 있음에도 말이다. 스포티파이가 업계에 독을 풀었다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "안녕하세요. minieetea 입니다.\n오랜기간 블로그에 아무런 글을 남기지 않았습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 꾸준히 찾아주시고 지난 글을 읽어주신 분들이 계셨는데요. 이 자리를 빌어 감사의 인사를 전해드리고 싶습니다.\n1년 반이 넘는 기간 동안 글쓰기를 멈추면서 저에겐 많은 시련과 도전과 모험과 변화들이 있었는데요. 다시금 글을 쓸 수 있도록 작은 프로젝트를 시도해보려고 합니다.\n저에게 코칭이 주는 가치\n저는 타인을 돕고 변화시키는 것에서 많은 에너지를 얻습니다. 하루짜리 세미나, 컨퍼런스 발표는 일방적인 정보전달에 그칠 때가 많았고, 커피챗을 통한 1on1 의 경우에 열과 성의를 다해 조언을 드려보았지만, 실제로 변화가 일어났는지 어떤 성장을 하고 있는지 지켜보기 어려웠던 것 같아요. 덕분에 한동안 커뮤니티 활동에 대해 회의감을 가지고 있기도 했습니다.\n이런 활동들을 지켜볼 수 있는 회사 내에서 해야겠다, 라는 생각도 많이 했었어요. 하지만 우리 팀이 아니라면 영향을 주고 받기가 어려운 것이 사실인 것 같아요. 어떠한 권한도 갖지 않은 상태에서 타 팀의 PM의 성장에 기여를 하기란 정말 어려운 일이었습니다.\n그러다 최근에는 코칭을 공부하면서, 여러가지 도구들을 공부하게 되고 연습하게 되었어요. 물론 팀 내에서도 적용해볼 수 있겠지만, 코칭이란 알지 못하는 사람들도 변화할 수 있게 돕는 일이다 보니 아예 새로운 분들을 돕는 일을 시도해야 배움의 가치를 진정으로 느낄 수 있을 것이라 외부 코칭 프로젝트를 결심하게 되었어요.\n여러분들에게 코칭이 주게될 의미\n많은 교육과 워크샵의 가장 큰 어려움이 현실세계의 나의 문제를 해결하려면 뭔가가 애~매하게? 맞아떨어지지 않아 적용하지 못하는 것입니다. 아마도 많은 책이나 강의들을 들으면서 성장의 갈증을 느끼셨을 것 같아요. 저 또한 정말 수 많은 책들을 읽으면서 지식의 축적으로만 성장감을 찾을 수 밖에 없었는데요. 책을 읽을 시간이 없거나, 더이상 업무지식에 도움이 되지 않는 순간에 도달하더라구요.\n코칭하는 법을 배우고, 또 코칭을 받아보면서 느낀 점은 효용감이라는 게 돌파구를 찾아내는 굉장히 큰 에너지를 만들어 준다는 점이었습니다. 특별히 새로운 지식을 얻은 것도 아니지만, \"내가 할 수 있겠다\" 또는 \"내가 할 수 있는 방법을 찾을 수 있겠다\" 라는 자신감이 이미 내 안에서 자라나고, 문제를 해결해내는 것을 보는 과정이 굉장히 짜릿했어요.\n사수가 없고, 일에 확신이 없고, 내가 무엇을 잘하는지 모를 때 내 안에서 정답을 찾아가는 방법으로 극복할 수 있다면 어떤 변화가 일어날까요?\n내가 스스로 찾을 수 있다는 효용감을 채워드릴 수 있을 것입니다.\n어떻게 진행되나요?\n멘토링이 아니기 때문에, 제가 가진 경험을 공유하기 보다는 여러분들이 가진 내제화된 잠재력을 끌어내기 위한 방식으로 진행됩니다. 주기는 주 1회 30분의 온라인 미팅으로 4주간 진행됩니다. 미팅 전에 미리 코칭받고자 하는 주제나 문제에 대해 알려주시면 됩니다. 코칭이 끝나면, 본인 변화에 대한 회고와 코칭 전/후에 대한 평가를 남겨주시면 코칭이 마무리됩니다.\n8월 한달간 진행될 3분을 선정할 계획이며, 이 분들께는 무료로 코칭이 진행됩니다.  (이후 9월부터는 아직 계획되지 않았습니다.)\n신청에 자격이 있나요?\n없습니다. 다만, PM/PO 에게 더 우선순위를 높여 드리고자 해요.\n신청하기 전에 꼭 읽어주세요.\n저 또한 배운 것을 적용해보고자하여 시작하는 작은 프로젝트다 보니, 여러분들의 문제점을 제가 도와드리기 어려운 순간이 생길 것 같아요. 이럴 때에는 동료 코치나 선배 코치들로 부터 조언을 요청하고 얻어야 할 수도 있을텐데, 반드시 제가 사전에 여러분께 동의를 구하고, 문제 상황에 대한 조언을 얻도록 하겠습니다.\n또, 코칭 질문과 답변들이 도움이 된 케이스에 대해서는 조금 더 정제하여, 블로그 글을 통해 더 많은 분들께 도움이 될 수 있도록 2차 기여를 하는 부분에 대해서도 상호 동의하에 공유될 수 있도록 하겠습니다.\n신청은 이렇게 해주세요~\nminieetea@gmail.com 으로, [8월코칭] 이라는 말머리를 달고, 왜 이 코칭을 받아보고 싶은지에 대해 메일을 보내주세요.\n신청 마감은 8월 2일까지(금요일 자정) 받고, 주말간 연락을 드리도록 하겠습니다. 선정되지 않으신 경우에도 메일을 드릴 예정이니 답장을 기다려주세요. 메일 답장까지 완료되면 이후로는 이메일 주소를 지워둘 예정이라, 이 글에 메일주소가 적혀있다면 일단 보내주셔도 됩니다.\n부디 3분을 만날 수 있기를 바라며 peace- \n 썸네일사진: Unsplash의Olena Bohovyk",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "미국 사업가들이 자주 하는 말과 비즈니스 관련 글을 보면 가끔 등장하는 어휘 중 force multiplier라는 단어가 있다. 원래 군대에서 유래된 말인데 찾아보니 우리말의 정확한 어휘는 ‘전력 증강자’ 또는 ‘전력 승수’이고, 사전적인 의미는 전투 부대에 추가적으로 사용되었을 때 부대의 전투력을 두드러지게 증가시키고 나아가서 부대의 임무 성공 가능성을 높이는 역량 혹은 능력이다. 이런 전력 증강자의 대표적인 사례가 특수부대, GPS와 같은 기술, 또는 육해공군의 연합 등이다.\n이 단어는 스타트업 분야에서도 꽤 다양한 의미로 자주 사용되는데, 2주 전에 미국에서 어떤 창업가와 이야기하다가 이 force multiplier라는 말을 내가 오랜만에 언급됐다.\n나는 모르는 사람이랑 절대로 말을 안 한다. 특히나 비행기에서는 조용히 가는 걸 선호해서 옆 사람이랑 눈도 되도록 맞추지 않고, 누가 말을 걸어도 두 번째 질문은 못 하게 아주 단답형으로 대답하는 편이다. 이날은 어떤 젊은 백인 여성분이 내 옆에 앉았고, 3시간 반 비행을 같이 하게 됐다. 비행 내내 둘 다 각자의 노트북을 열심히 두드리고 있었는데 불규칙한 키보드 타격 소리와 속도로 봤을 때 아마도 글을 쓰거나 콘텐츠를 만들고 있는 것 같았다. 그런데 비행 내내 글이 잘 안 써지거나, 생각이 정리가 안 되거나, 영감이 안 떠오르는지 혼자 계속 한숨을 쉬면서 중얼거렸다. 실은 나도 뭔가를 쓸 때, 정리가 안 되거나, 영감이 안 떠오르면 이런 행동을 하므로 금방 알 수 있었는데, 이분은 이런 행동과 동작이 좀 과격했다.\n그래서 이분에게 “그냥 궁금해서 그런데, 뭐 쓰고 있어요? 잘 안되나 보죠?”라고 물어봤고 그때부터 한 15분 정도 우린 이야기를 나눴다. 본인은 시카고 외곽 동네에서 수공예품을 직접 만들어서 파는 작은 가게를 운영하는 자영업자인데, 그동안 오프라인 가게에서만 제품을 판매하다가 이제 미국의 다른 도시나 주에서 구매 문의가 와서 Shopify로 만든 사이트로 최근에 이커머스를 시작한 초보 창업가라고 소개했다.\n돈이 별로 없어서, 직원 고용은 아직 생각도 못 하고 있고, 혼자서 제품을 직접 만들고, 혼자서 사이트도 운영하고, 혼자서 포장과 배송도 직접 하고 있는데, 어쨌든 힘들지만, 굉장히 재미있고 보람찬 일이라고 자랑했다. 온라인 마케팅 예산이 없어서 공짜이면서 동시에 효율이 좋다고 하는 블로그와 뉴스레터 기반의 콘텐츠 마케팅을 이제 3개월째 하고 있는데, 막상 없는 콘텐츠를 만드는 작업이 시간과 에너지가 많이 투입되는 상당히 고통스러운 일이고, 이렇게 투자하는 에너지와 시간 대비 눈에 띄는 결과가 전혀 안 보여서, 이런 콘텐츠 마케팅이 정말 될까 굉장히 회의적이라고 고민을 토로했다. 그리고 지금 이 비행기에서도 다음 주에 발송할 뉴스레터에 실을 내용에 대해서 고민하고 있고, 격주로 포스팅하는 블로그에 올릴 소재가 이미 다 떨어져서 계속 한숨만 쉬고 있었던 것이다.\n나는 내가 VC라는 말은 안 했다. 하지만, 내 블로그에 관해서 이야기를 좀 해줬다. 내가 운영하는 개인 블로그를 2007년부터 쓰기 시작했고, 지금도 꾸준히 17년째 쓰고 있는데, 이게 확실히 개인적이든 사업적이든 force multiplier가 될 수 있다는 건 내가 경험적으로 보장할 수 있다고 해줬다. 그런데 이게 진정한 전력 승수가 되려면, 최소 2년은 꾸준히 해야 하고, 여기서 명심해야 하는 건 블로그의 첫 2년은 최소한의 노력으로 최대의 효과를 만드는 force multiplier가 아니라 그 반대인 force divider라는 점도 알려줬다.\n전력 승수를 위한 기반을 만들기 위한 첫 2년은 콘텐츠를 만드는데 정말 많은 시간과 노력을 투입하지만, 그로 인한 효과는 눈에 거의 보이지 않는다. 일단 아무도 이런 콘텐츠가 있다는 걸 모르고, 아무리 좋은 포스팅이라도 이런 블로그가 존재한다는 것도 모른다. 이 기간 동안엔 블로그나 뉴스레터를 활용하는 콘텐츠 마케팅은 전형적인 force divider가 된다.\n하지만, 세상 모든 일이 그렇듯이, 결국 복리의 마법은 항상 작동한다. 꾸준히, 정기적으로, 그리고 오랜 기간 동안 양질의 콘텐츠를 만들면, 누군가는 읽을 것이고, 남들과 계속 공유할 것이다. 그러다가 어느 순간이나 어떤 계기를 통해서 그동안 꾸준히 만들었던 양질의 콘텐츠는 엄청난 전력 증강자가 될 것이다.\n뭐, 대충 이런 이야기를 비행기에서 옆 좌석 분과 했다. 그리고 이제 시작했고, 아직은 결과가 나오지 않지만, compounding과 force multiplier라는 단어를 무조건 기억하라고 했다.\n누구나 다 인생에서, 또는 직장에서 이런 전력 증강자를 원할 것이다. 실은, 누구에게나 가능하고 누구나 스스로 만들 수 있다고 생각한다. 단지 약간의 노력과 꾸준함이 필요할 뿐이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새도 MBTI 이야기를 사람들이 많이 하는지 모르겠지만, 한때는 우리가 검토했던 회사 자료의 팀 슬라이드에 각 팀원의 MBTI가 보일 정도로 이게 유행했을 때가 있었다. 나는 MBTI를 맹신하진 않지만, 나름의 과학은 있다고 생각한다. 나는 이 MBTI 풀 버전을 2005년 마이크로소프트에서 일할 때 처음 했던 기억이 난다. 당시엔 내가 E 성향이 강했는데, 그동안 이게 I로 바뀌었고, 요샌 나는 아주 행복한 I의 삶을 살고 있다. 성향이 I라서 그런지, 아니면 그냥 바빠서 그런지, 나는 외부 활동을 잘 안 하고, 사람들을 잘 안 만난다. 정확히 말하자면, 원래 아는 사람들과 친구들은 자주 만나지만, 새로운 사람들은 되도록 잘 안 만난다.\n그래도 예외를 두고, 가능하면 시간을 만들면서 꼭 만나는 사람들도 있는데, 이제 막 본인의 이름으로 VC를 시작해서 첫 번째 펀드를 만들고 있는 투자자들, 그리고 우리가 투자는 안 했지만, 음악 분야에서 스타트업하는 창업가들이다.\n이제 첫 번째 펀드를 만들고 있는 VC들을 보면 내가 12년 전에 스트롱 1호 펀드 만들 때가 생각난다. 남의 돈을 받는 건, 그때도 어려웠고 지금도 어렵고 앞으로도 항상 어려울 것이다. 참고로 우린 이제 5호 펀드를 만들고 있는데, 1호 펀드보다 규모만 커졌지 돈 모으는 건 항상 더럽게 어렵다. 그런데 성적이 전혀 없는 첫 번째 펀드를 만드는 VC를 뭘 믿고 누가 돈을 줄까? 그래서 나는 이런 분들을 보면, 우리가 첫 번째 펀드 만들 때가 많이 생각난다. 그때 참 힘들고, 외롭고, 서럽기도 했는데, 그나마 계속할 수 있었던 이유 중 하나가 나보다 먼저 이 힘든 길을 지나왔던 선배 VC들의 격려와 조언이었다. 그때 가장 많이 들었던 말이 “원래 처음엔 힘든데, 계속 지치지 않고 하다 보면 더 쉬워질 거야.” , “그래도 너는 내가 처음 시작했을 때보다 훨씬 잘하고 있으니까 너무 걱정하지 마.” , “원래 펀드 못 만들 것 같아도, 계속하다 보면 다 하게 된다. 그냥 시간이 걸릴 뿐이야.” 뭐, 이런 말들이었는데, 그땐 이 조언들이 얼마나 힘이 됐는지 모른다.\n근데 참 웃긴 게, 나도 이제 시작하는 후배 VC 분들을 만나면, 12년 전에 내가 들었던 말과 거의 동일한 조언을 해준다. 그리고 이들이 아직 경험하지 못한 걸 내가 이미 경험했다면, 가감 없이 모든 경험을 다 공유하고, 가능한 선에서 되도록 많은 사람들을 소개해 주고 연결해 준다. 그래서 이분들이 힘든 길을 가는데 조금이나마 위안과 도움이 됐으면 하는 생각을 항상 한다.\n음악 분야에서 스타트업하는 창업가들에게도 내가 아주 오래전에 뮤직쉐이크를 하면서 경험하고 느꼈던 점들을 아주 솔직하게 공유해주고 이들이 시행착오를 줄이고 조금이라도 정신적인 평화를 찾을 수 있길 바란다. 나도 15년 전에 뭘 어떻게 해야 할지 완전히 아무것도 모를 때 이미 그 길을 걸었던 선배들에게 큰 도움을 받았기 때문이다.\n최근 미국 출장에서 수년 동안 내가 알고 지낸 잠재 투자자를 만났다. 유명하고 큰 투자자인데, 누구나 다 만나고 싶어 하는 사람이라서 아주 바쁜 분이다. 그런데 이 분은 내가 미국에 올 때마다 연락하면 항상 시간을 만들어서 나를 만난다. 시간이 많을 땐 밥도 같이 먹고, 정말 바쁘면 15분이라도 짧게 시간을 내서 얼굴이라도 본다. 나를 볼 때마다 20년 전에 본인이 투자를 시작했을 때가 생각난다고 하면서 원래 남의 돈 받는 건 무지하게 어려운데, 그래도 스트롱은 아주 잘하고 있다는 큰 격려의 말을 해줬다. 그리고 본인도 시작할 때, 이렇게 만나서 긍정의 말 한마디 해주는 선배 투자자들이 정말 고마웠다고 한다.\n이런 말을 들을 때마다 항상 나 자신을 되돌아보게 된다. 아무리 바쁘지만, 내가 처음에 어떻게 시작했고, 어디서 왔는지 기억하자는 다짐을 한다. 나는 아직 개구리로 완벽하게 변신하진 못했지만, 올챙이 시절은 벗어났다고 생각한다. 누구에게나 애송이 시절이 있었고, 누구나 다 올챙이를 거쳐서 개구리가 된다. 내가 어디서 왔는지 절대로 잊지 말자는 다짐을 오늘도 해본다.",

권리적인 사항\n① 계약 해제 시 위약금에 대한 내용\n아래와 같은 위약금 조항이 없으면, 상대방의 단순변심으로 계약 해제를 하더라도 별도의 손해배상을 받기가 쉽지 않다.\n\n✅ 일방의 계약 해제 또는 계약 위반에 따른 손해배상으로 매도자는 받은 계약금의 두 배의 금액을 매수자는 계약금을 위약금으로 약정한다.\n\n\n② 매수한 주택에 세를 놓아야 하는 경우\n매수자가 실입주하지 않는 경우, 새로운 임차인을 구해야 하기 때문에 이러한 점을 사전에 매도자에게 알리고 협조를 구한다.\n\n✅ 매도자(또는 점유자)는 매수인이 새로운 임대차 계약을 체결하는 것에 최대한 협조하기로 하며, 매수자와 부동산의 요구가 있을 경우 집을 보여주는 것에 적극 협조하기로 한다.\n\n\n③ 매수자가 잔금을 새로운 임차인의 보증금으로 충당하려 할 때\n다음과 같은 특약이 없을 경우, 매수자에게 권한이 없기 때문에 새로운 임차인이 소유권이전등기(잔금) 후에 입주할 경우 매도자와 임대차계약서를 작성하고, 입주한 뒤에 매수자와 계약서를 다시 작성해야 하는 번거로움이 발생할 수 있다.\n\n✅ 매수자의 잔금 중 일부를 새로운 임차인의 보증금으로 충당하기로 하며, 이때 매도자는 새로운 임대차계약체결 권한을 매수자에게 부여하기로 한다.\n\n\n④ 기존 임대차를 매수자가 승계할 경우\n매수자는 계약 체결 시 해당 주택의 임대차계약서 사본을, 잔금 시에는 원본을 매도자에게 받아야 한다. 특히 다가구주택의 경우에는 각 호실별로 임대내역(보증금 및 월세, 계약기간)을 모두 매매계약서에 기재해야 한다.\n\n✅ 매수자는 해당 주택의 모든 임대차를 승계하기로 한다. 현 임차인(임차인 ○○○, 보증금 ○○원, 만기 ○○년 ○○월 ○○일)은 매수자가 그대로 승계한다.\n\n참고로 임차인은 계약기간 도중 임대인(소유자)이 바뀔 경우, 계약기간의 잔존 여부와 상관없이 계약을 해지하고 임대차를 종료할 수 있다.(대법원 1998.9.2. 자98마100결정)\n그러므로 임대 목적으로 매수할 경우 매매계약서를 작성할 때, 안전 장치로 ‘임대인 변경에 대한 임차인 동의서’ 또는 기존의 임차인과 ‘재계약서’를 바로 작성해놓는 것이 좋다.\n\n⑤ 임차인 있는 주택에 매수자가 실입주를 해야 하는 경우\n계약 당시에 해당 주택에 임차인이 거주하고 있는 경우, 매수자가 실입주를 하기 위해서는 잔금 시까지 임차인을 내보내야 한다. 이때 누구의 책임하에 임차인을 내보낼지를 명확하게 해둬야 한다.\n\n✅ 매수자는 해당 주택에 실입주할 예정이므로 매도자는 잔금 시까지 현 임차인에 대한 명도를 책임지기로 한다. \n✅ 임차인 명도에 차질이 생겨 발생하는 모든 비용은 매도자가 부담하기로 한다.\n\n\n⑥ ‘.css-wi4a2c{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-weight:bold;}토지거래허가구역’ 내의 주택일 경우\n소유권이전등기를 하기 위해서 토지거래허가를 받아야 하는 지역 내 주택이라면 계약서 특약 사항란에 허가 여부에 따른 향후 조치에 대한 내용을 반드시 기재해 놓아야 한다.\n\n✅ 해당 주택의 소재 지역은 토지거래허가구역으로 만일 토지거래허가가 나지 않을 경우 본 매매계약은 무효로 하며, 매도자는 아무런 조건 없이 계약금을 즉시 매수자에게 반환하기로 한다. 매도자와 매수자는 이와 관련하여 상대방에게 그 어떠한 손해배상도 청구하지 않기로 한다.\n\n\n⑦ 단독주택 등에서 대지면적에 대한 차이가 있을 경우\n오래된 단독주택은 건물보다는 땅의 가치가 매매가에서 큰 비중을 차지하게 된다. 그래서 ‘평당 얼마’라는 식으로 매매가가 정해지는 경우가 있다. 이때 향후 대지면적에 차이가 생길 경우 어떻게 해결할 것인지를 기재해 놓아야 한다.\n\n✅ 면적은 등기사항증명서 및 토지대장을 기준으로 하며, 차후 수량의 차이가 발견되어도 매수자는 매도자에게 일체의 이의 제기를 하지 않기로 한다. → 매도자 유리\n✅ 본건 토지대장 등 공부상의 면적을 기준으로 한 매매이며, 잔금 후 30일 이내에 실측 후 공부상면적과 실측면적에 차이가 발생할 경우 평당 ○○만원을 감액하기로 한다. → 매수자 유리\n✅ 본 매매계약은 ‘수량지정매매’이며, 총매매대금 ○○만원(평당 ○○만원×○○평)으로 산정되었으므로 향후 거래평수와 실제평수가 차이가 날 경우 차이 나는 금액만큼 반환하기로 한다.  → 매수자 유리\n\n수량지정매매란 거래 대상물의 가격을 산정할 때 ‘평당 얼마’ 혹은 ‘개당 얼마’ 등의 식으로 수량으로 매매가를 산정하는 방식이다. 이 방식은 아파트, 빌라 등의 공동주택 매매에서는 크게 의미가 없지만, 단독주택과 같이 대지의 비중이 큰 주택 거래 시에는 의미가 있다. 특히 신축을 목적으로 하는 주택은 대지의 면적에 따라 건물의 크기와 설계 등이 달라질 수 있으므로 중요한 의미를 갖는다.\n\n⑧ 부가세(VAT) 관련 비용\n일반적으로 주택의 경우에는 부가세 문제가 없어 특별히 신경 쓸 부분이 없으나, 상가주택의 상가에는 부가세가 발생한다. 이때 부가세를 누가 부담할지에 대해 명확하게 기재해 놓아야 한다.\n\n✅ 해당 주택의 1층은 근린생활시설(상가)로 부가세는 매수자가 부담하기로 한다.\n\n참고로 부가세에 대한 언급이 없을 경우 매매 가격에 포함된 것으로 간주되어 매도자가 부담하게 된다.\n2. 매매 시 특약 문구 - 물리적인 사항\n① 옵션과 관련된 사항\n최근에는 가전제품이 옵션으로 설치되어 있는 경우가 많다. 처음부터 빌트인되어 있던 제품이라면 관계없지만, 매도자 입장에서는 자신이 살면서 나중에 설치한 제품이라면 해당 주택의 매매와는 별도라고 생각하는 경우가 의외로 많다. 그러므로 옵션에 대한 특약 사항을 명확하게 기재함으로써 분쟁을 미연에 방지하도록 한다. 특히 단독주택의 경우 고가의 나무, 조형물(암석) 등이 있을 경우 소유권의 범위를 특약 사항에 명확하게 기재해 놓아야 한다.\n\n✅ 현재 해당 주택에 설치되어 있는 전기인덕션, 식기세척기, 김치냉장고, 디지털도어록은 매매 목적물에 포함된 것이다. → 매수자 유리\n✅ 현재 해당 주택에 주방에 설치되어 있는 전기인덕션는 잔금 시 매도자가 가지고 가기로 한다. → 매도자 유리\n✅ 대문을 기준으로 우측에 식재되어 있는 소나무는 잔금 시 매도자가 가지고 가기로 한다. → 매도자 유리\n\n\n② 하자담보책임 범위 및 기간\n집을 사자마자 하자가 발생하면 매수자의 입장에서는 금전적, 정신적 피해를 받게 된다. 그러므로 범위와 일정 기간을 정해서 최소한 그 사이에 발생하는 하자에 대한 책임을 매도자에게 지도록 하는 내용의 특약 사항을 기재해 놓는 것이 좋다.\n\n✅ 매도자는 해당 부동산의 잔금일로부터 6개월 내에 발생하는 모든 하자에 대한 책임을 지기로 한다. 단, ‘누수’와 ‘균열’과 같은 중대한 하자는 그 기간을 1년으로 한다. → 매수자 유리\n✅ 매매계약 시, 중대한 하자(내부누수 등)에 대하여 미고지 후 발생하는 하자는 매도인이 책임지기로 한다. → 매수자 유리\n\n\n③ 현 시설 상태에서 매매계약인 경우\n‘현 시설 상태에서’라는 말은 향후 매수자가 매도자에게 부동산의 사소한 하자에 대하여 책임을 물을 수 없다는 말과 같다. 계약서 작성 전에 해당 주택의 시설상태를 확인하고 진행했기 때문에 매도자의 고의가 아니라면 어느 정도 책임을 면할 수 있다는 조항이 될 수 있다.\n\n✅ 매수자의 현장 방문 확인 후, 쌍방 협의에 따라 현 시설 상태에서 진행하는 계약이다. → 매도자 유리\n\n\n④ 제세공과금 및 기타 관리비 정산 관련\n일반적으로 공과금 정산 시점은 ‘잔금일(입주일)’이다. 상호 협의 하에 다른 날을 기준일로 정할 수도 있다.\n\n✅ 잔금일까지의 제세공과금 및 기타 관리비는 매도자가 부담하기로 한다.\n\n\n⑤ 잔금 지급 이전에 리모델링에 관한 사항\n간혹 잔금 전에 리모델링을 사유로 매매 목적물을 먼저 인수받는 매수자 중에서 새로운 흠집(하자) 등을 근거로 매매금액을 깎으려고 시도하거나 새로운 요구사항을 제시하는 경우가 있다. 매도자의 입장에서는 이러한 특약 사항을 미리 넣어놓음으로써 매수자의 새로운 요구사항을 자연스럽게 거절할 수 있다.\n\n✅ 매도자는 매수자가 잔금 지급 전에 리모델링 공사를 하는 것에 동의(협조)한다. → 매수자 유리\n✅ 매도자는 매수자가 리모델링 공사를 시작하기 전날까지 일체의 공과금 및 세금을 정산하고 열쇠(비밀번호)와 함께 매수자에게 인도하며, 이 시점을 기준으로 관리비 등 일체의 공과금은 매수자가 부담하기로 한다. → 매도자·매수자 모두 유리\n✅ 매도자는 잔금 전 매수자가 리모델링 공사를 하는 것에 동의하기로 하며, 매수자가 리모델링 공사 시작일부터 본 부동산에 관하여 매매대금을 포함하여 그 어떠한 이의를 제기하지 않기로 한다. → 매도자 유리\n✅ 집수리 시부터 관리비는 매수자가 부담하기로 하며, 이때부터 매도자는 해당 주택에 대한 하자담보의 책임에서 면책하기로 한다. → 매도자 유리\n\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호\n해당 콘텐츠는 2024.08.02. 기준으로 작성되었습니다.",

(중략)\n\n\n트럼프 전 대통령은 자국 상품의 가격 경쟁력을 높이기 위해 해외 수입품에 높은 관세를 부과하겠다고 밝혔습니다. 중국산 제품에는 60~100%, 그외 다른 나라 제품에는 10% 정도로요. 대미 수출이 중요한 나라들 입장에서는 관세 폭탄을 맞은 느낌일 겁니다.\n우리나라는 기사에서 언급된 2018년 트럼프 전 대통령 집권 당시 관세 폭탄을 맞은 경험이 있는데요. 당시 최대 30%의 관세가 부과됐어요. 그때 발동된 세이프가드(긴급수입제한조치)는 자국에 심각한 피해가 우려될 경우, 관세를 대폭 올리거나 수입 물량을 줄이는 등의 방법으로 자국 무역을 보호하기 위한 장치였다 볼 수 있겠습니다.\n트럼프 전 대통령은 미국의 경제와 일자리를 보호하기 위해 중국산 제품에 높은 관세를 부과하고, 필요할 경우 세이프가드 같은 조치까지 감행해 외국산 제품의 수입을 제한하려는 정책을 추진하고자 합니다.\n밴스 상원의원은 17일 진행된 공화당 전당대회에서 트럼프보다도 강한 미국 우선주의를 강조하기도 했어요. 부통령 후보 수락 연설 중 일자리를 늘리고, 미국의 제조업을 부활시킬 것이라며 보호무역주의 색을 강하게 드러냈는데요. 그는 “우리는 무한한 글로벌 무역을 위해 공급망을 희생하는 것을 끝내고, 더 많은 제품에 ‘메이드 인 아메리카(Made in America)’라는 아름다운 라벨을 붙일 것\"이며, “미국에 공장을 다시 짓고, 미국 노동자들의 손으로 만든, 진짜 제품들을 만드는 일에 사람들을 투입할 것\"이라고도 말했습니다.\n이에 따라 국내 가전업계는 미국 시장의 큰 변화에 대응할 수 있는 전략을 마련하고, 정부는 국내 기업의 피해를 최소화하기 위해 미국과의 무역 협상에서 적극적으로 대처해야 할 필요가 있겠습니다.\n보통 자국 무역보호주의에서 이어지는 각국의 수입규제 조치가 확대되면, 기업들은 해외투자를 늘려 현지에 공장 등 생산시설을 짓거나 물류 경로 및 수출선 다변화 등을 꾀하기도 합니다. 최근 몇 년간 미국과 중국 간 갈등이 고조되면서 기업들 입장에서는 글로벌 공급망 재배치 및 재구축을 고민해야 하는 상황에 마주했고요.\n특히 미국은 적극적인 기업유치 활동을 통해 미국에 직접 투자할 것을 권하며, 이에 많은 기업이 미국에 대한 투자를 늘리고 현지 생산시설을 건설합니다. 특히 미국이 중국 제품에 대한 대규모 관세를 부과하게 되면 중국에 공장을 두고 중간재를 수출하는 한국 기업 입장에서도 큰 타격을 받게 됩니다.\n따라서 미중 갈등을 계기로 중국에 대한 의존도를 낮출 필요성이 제기되고 있으며, 중국 이외의 지역으로 공장을 옮기는 방안을 포함해 물류와 생산 방식을 다변화하고 기업 공급망을 재편하는 방안을 검토해볼 수 있을 것입니다.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n자유 무역: 국제 무역에서 상품 교역에 대한 정부의 간섭을 최소화하는 무역 제도로 보호 무역과 대비되는 개념. 자유 무역을 통해 국가 간 상호 이익이 늘어나고 경제 성장을 이룰 수 있습니다. 자유 무역이 활성화되면 자국 산업을 보호하기 위한 관세나 수입 제한 등의 규제가 최소화돼요.\n최혜국 대우: 특정 국가에 다른 국가들보다 더 유리한 관세율과 통관 절차를 제공하는 것. 이러한 대우를 받는 나라를 최혜국이라 하며, 조약에 들어 있는 그러한 조항을 최혜국 조항이라고 합니다. 무역 협정에서 흔히 볼 수 있으며, 무역 상대국에게 가장 유리한 조건을 제공함으로써 양국 간의 무역을 활성화하려는 목적이 있어요.\n관세율: 수입품에 부과되는 세금의 비율. 관세율은 국가별로 다르게 적용되며, 수입품의 종류와 가격에 따라 다르게 적용될 수 있습니다. 높은 관세율은 수입품의 가격을 상승시켜 자국 제품을 보호하고, 낮은 관세율은 수입품의 가격을 낮추어 소비자들이 다양한 국가의 상품 중 본인에게 가장 잘 맞는 것을 선택할 수 있는 넓은 선택권을 가져다 줄 수 있어요.\n\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0 8px;cursor:pointer;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--adaptiveGrey700);}\n.css-1dzrkjz{width:16px;margin-right:8px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;}\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper >.svg-icon:empty+.svg-icon-fallback{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}.svg-icon{color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon svg,.svg-icon img{display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon--hide{display:none;}.svg-icon-fallback{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:0;z-index:z-index(hidden);visibility:hidden;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon-fallback--show{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}\n참고 자료\n\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",

(참고로 항공기 한 대 가격이 워낙 비싸기 때문에, 항공사들은 항공기를 직접 구매하기 보다 리스를 주로 합니다)\n반면, 가변비용은 항공사가 항공편을 운영하는 데에 들어가는 비용 중 승객 수나 항공편 수에 따라 변하는 비용입니다. 연료비, 공항 이용료, 기내 서비스 비용 등이 있어요.\n고정비용 관점에서 보면, 승객이 많든 적든 항공기 리스 비용과 직원들에 대한 급여는 매달 고정적으로 나가야 하는데요. 경유 항공편은 한 항공기를 여러 구간으로 나누어 운영하기 때문에, 탑승률을 높일 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다. 한 항공기로 더 많은 승객을 태우면 원래 나가야 하는 고정비용이 여러 구간의 승객들에 의해 분산될 수 있는 것이죠.\nG: 몇 명이 탑승하든, 몇 번의 항공을 담당하든 고정비용은 어차피 나가야 하는 돈이니 항공사 입장에서 손해를 안 볼 수 있는 좋은 방법이겠네요.\nK: 맞습니다. 좀더 자세한 예시를 들어 볼게요. 서울에서 파리로 가는 직항 항공편은 한 번의 비행으로 전체 고정비용을 충당해야 합니다. 반면, 서울에서 두바이를 경유해 파리로 가는 항공편은 서울 - 두바이, 두바이 - 파리 두 구간으로 나누어 각 구간 승객들에게 고정비용을 분산하여 부담시킬 수 있는 것입니다.\n가변비용 관점에서 보면, 경유 항공편은 연료비와 공항 이용료 등이 직항편에 비해 증가할 수 있습니다. 그러나 경유편 운영을 통해 얻을 수 있는 고정비용 절감 효과에 비해 가변비용의 증가분은 크지 않을 수 있어요.\n서울에서 파리로 가는 두바이 경유 항공편의 경우, 두바이에서 추가 승객을 태워 얻을 수 있는 추가 이익이 추가로 발생하는 연료비와 공항 이용료보다 더 큰 것이죠.\nG: 결과적으로 항공사는 경유편 운영을 통해 비용을 절감할 수 있고, 이런 이유로 경유 항공편 가격이 직항 항공편보다 저렴하게 설정될 수 있는 것이군요.\nK: 그렇죠. 참고로 미국은 땅이 워낙 넓다 보니, 다른 도시로 이동할 때 (우리가 기차 타듯) 거의 모든 사람들이 비행기를 타잖아요. 비행기 사용량이 많아질 수밖에 없으니, 미국 주요 항공사들은 직항편보다 주요 허브 공항을 중심으로 여러 목적지를 연결하는 방식인 허브 앤 스포크(Hub-and-Spoke) 시스템을 운영합니다.\n델타 항공은 애틀랜타(Atlanta) 공항, 아메리칸 항공은 댈러스-포트워스(Dallas/Fort Worth) 공항, 유나이티드 항공은 시카고 오헤어(Chicago O’Hare) 공항을 허브 공항으로 사용하는데요. 경유 항공편을 통해 여러 승객을 허브 공항으로 모으고, 거기서 다시 다양한 목적지로 연결시킴으로써 비용을 절감할 수 있는 것이죠.\nG: 같은 이유로 미국 내 이동을 담당하는 항공편 역시 직항보다 경유가 저렴하군요. 직항 항공편은 허브 공항을 거치지 않고 바로 목적지로 가는 편리함을 제공하니, 더 높은 요금이 부과되는 경향이 있는 것이고요.\n3) 가격 차별 (price discrimination)\nK: 맞습니다. 한편, 경유 항공편이 직항 항공편보다 저렴한 이유를 ‘가격 차별’ 관점에서도 설명할 수 있는데요. 보통 기업은 수익을 극대화하기 위해 동일 제품이나 서비스에 가격을 다르게 설정하곤 합니다. 얼마나 비용을 지불할 능력과 의지가 있는지에 따라 고객군을 구분하죠.\n항공편을 예로 들어보겠습니다. 출장 목적으로 항공기를 이용하는 고객들은 시간에 민감해요. 출장 비용은 보통 회사에서 지원을 받기 때문에 시간을 아끼기 위해 더 비싼 직항 항공편을 선택할 가능성이 높고요.\n반면 상대적으로 시간에 여유가 있거나 비용을 중요하게 여기는 고객들은 시간이 더 걸리고 불편하더라도 비용을 아끼기 위해 경유 항공편을 선택할 가능성이 높습니다.\n항공사 입장에서는 이렇게 서로 다른 성격을 갖는 고객들에게 다른 가격을 책정한 항공편을 판매하고자 합니다. 직항 항공편과 경유 항공편에 서로 다른 가격을 책정하고, 더 많은 고객을 유치하고 수익을 늘리려 하는 것이죠.\n그래서 저가 항공사들은 더 싼 비용을 선호하는 고객들에게 다양한 경유 항공편을 낮은 가격에 제공합니다. 학생이나 예산이 한정되어 있는 여행객들을 주된 타겟으로 삼는 것이죠. 저가 항공사 입장에서는 고가의 직항 항공권 대비 저렴한 경유 항공권을 다양한 조건으로 판매하는 전략이 항공 시장 내 점유율을 높이는 것이라 판단한 것이죠.\nG: 그렇겠네요. 비용에 민감한 고객들을 데려올 수 있는 확실한 방법이니까요.\nK: 이러한 가격 차별 원리를 항공편이 아닌 다른 분야에서도 찾아볼 수 있는데요. 예전에 살펴본 학생 할인이 대표적인 예시입니다. 학생들은 직장인 대비 구매력이 떨어지는 고객이기에, 기업 입장에서는 아예 학생과 직장인 두 그룹으로 소비자를 구분해 서로 다른 가격을 매기는 것이죠.\n우리가 많이 이용하는 유튜브도 가격 차별 원리를 잘 이용하고 있습니다. 유튜브는 광고가 없는 유료 서비스와 중간에 광고가 포함되는 무료 서비스를 나누어 제공하고 있는데요. 비용을 내더라도 끊김 없이 시청하고자 하는 고객과 중간 광고가 좀 불편하더라도 비용을 아끼는 것이 더 중요한 고객을 아예 구분하고, 각각의 고객에 맞는 맞춤형 서비스를 제공하는 것입니다.\n넷플릭스도 마찬가지죠. 광고 없이 시청할 수 있는 상품에 비해, 중간 광고가 나오는 상품 가격이 더 저렴합니다. 시간이나 편의성을 중요시하는 고객에게는 프리미엄 버전을, 비용을 중시하는 고객에게는 보다 경제적인 버전을 제공하는 가격 차별 전략을 사용하는 것이죠.\n\n오늘은 경유 항공편이 직항 항공편을 비교해 보면서 항공사들이 어떻게 가격을 책정하고, 왜 일부 노선이 상대적으로 저렴한지에 대해 1) 수요와 공급의 원리, 2) 고정비용과 가변비용, 3) 가격 차별 - 세 가지 경제 이론으로 살펴보았는데요. 앞으로 여행 계획을 세울 때 이 개념을 떠올리면서 항공권의 가격을 비교해보면 좋을 것 같습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이제현",
