        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details about Glean, Meta’s open source system for collecting, deriving, and working with facts about source code.\nIn this blog post we’ll talk about why a system like Glean is important, explain the rationale for Glean’s design, and run through some of the ways we’re using Glean to supercharge our developer tooling at Meta.\nIn August 2021 we open-sourced our code indexing system Glean. Glean collects information about source code and provides it to developer tools through an efficient and flexible query language. We use Glean widely within Meta to power a range of developer tools including code browsing, code search, and documentation generation.\nCode Indexing\nMany tools that developers use rely on information extracted from the code they’re working on. For example:\nCode navigation (“Go to definition”) in an IDE or a code browser;\nCode search;\nAutomatically-generated documentation;\nCode analysis tools, such as dead code detection or linting.\nThe job of collecting information from code is often called code indexing. A code indexing system’s job is to efficiently answer the questions your tools need to ask, such as, “Where is the definition of MyClass?” or “Which functions are defined in myfile.cpp?”\nAn IDE will typically do indexing as needed, when you load a new file or project for example. But the larger your codebase, the more important it becomes to do code indexing ahead of time. For large projects it becomes impractical to have the IDE process all the code of your project at startup and, depending on what language you’re using, that point may come earlier or later: C++ in particular is problematic due to the long compile times.\nMoreover, with a larger codebase and many developers working on it, it makes sense to have a shared centralized indexing system so that we don’t repeat the work of indexing on every developer’s machine. And as the data produced by indexing can become large, we want to make it available over the network through a query interface rather than having to download it.\nThis leads to an architecture like this:\nIn practice the real architecture is highly distributed:\nIndexing can be heavily parallelized and we may have many indexing jobs running concurrently;\nThe query service will be widely distributed to support load from many clients that are also distributed;\nThe databases will be replicated across the query service machines and also backed up centrally.\nWe’ve found that having a centralized indexing infrastructure enables a wide range of powerful developer tools. We’ll talk about some of the ways we’ve deployed Glean shortly, but first we’ll dive into the rationale for Glean’s design.\nHow is Glean different?\nCode indexing systems have been around for a while. For example, there’s a well-established format called LSIF used by IDEs that caches information about code navigation.\nWhen we designed Glean we wanted a system that wasn’t tied either to particular programming languages or to any particular use case. While we had some use cases in mind that we wanted to support—primarily code navigation of course—we didn’t want to design the system around one use case, in the hope that a more general system would support emerging requirements further into the future.\nTherefore:\nGlean doesn’t decide for you what data you can store. Indeed, most languages that Glean indexes have their own data schema and Glean can store arbitrary non-programming-language data too. The data is ultimately stored using RocksDB, providing good scalability and efficient retrieval.\nGlean’s query language is very general. It’s a declarative logic-based query language that we call Angle (“Angle” is an anagram of “Glean”, and means “to fish”). Angle supports deriving information automatically, either on-the-fly at query time or ahead of time; this is a powerful mechanism that enables Glean to abstract over language-specific data and provide a language-neutral view of the data.\nStoring arbitrary language-specific data can be very powerful. For example, in C++ we use the detailed data to detect dead code such as unused #include or using statements. The latter in particular is rather tricky to do correctly and requires the data to include some C++-specific details, such as which using statement is used to resolve each symbol reference.\nOn the other hand, clients often don’t want the full language-specific data. They want to work at a higher level of abstraction. Imagine asking questions like, “Give me the names and locations of all the declarations in this file”, which should work for any language, and which you could use to implement a code outline feature in a code browser. Glean can provide this language-neutral view of the data by defining an abstraction layer in the schema itself – the mechanism is similar to SQL views if you’re familiar with those. This means that we don’t have to compromise between having detailed language-specific data or a lowest-common-denominator language-neutral view; we can have both.\nThis generality has allowed Glean to extend to a number of use cases beyond what we originally envisaged. We’ll cover some of those later in this post.\nA taste of Angle\nGlean has a unified language, Angle, for specifying both schemas and queries. As mentioned above, each language that we index has its own schema. To give you a flavor of this, here’s a fragment of the schema for C++ function declarations:\n\nDefining a schema for Glean is just like writing a set of type definitions. The braces surround a record definition, with a set of fields and their types. \nA FunctionDeclaration is a predicate (roughly equivalent to a table in SQL). \nThe instances of a predicate are called facts (roughly equivalent to rows in SQL). \nA predicate is a thing that you can query, and a query returns facts. \nTo query efficiently you specify a prefix of the fields. So, for example, we can retrieve a particular FunctionDeclaration efficiently if we know its name.\nLet’s write a query to find the function folly::parseJson:\n\nWithout going into all the details, at a high level this query specifies that we want to find FunctionDeclaration facts that have a particular name and namespace. Glean can return results for this query in about a millisecond.\nAngle supports more complex queries too. For example, to find all classes that inherit from a class called exception and have a method called what that overrides a method in a base class:\n\nThis query returns the first results in a few milliseconds, and because there might be a lot of results we can fetch the results incrementally from the query server.\nIncremental indexing\nAn important innovation in Glean is the ability to index incrementally. As the codebase grows, and the rate of change of the codebase increases (a monorepo suffers from both of these problems) we find that we can’t provide up-to-date information about the latest code because indexing the entire repository can take a long time. The index is perpetually out of date, perhaps by many hours.\nThe solution to this scaling problem is to process just the changes. In terms of computer science big-O notation, we want the cost of indexing to be O(changes) rather than O(repository).\nBut actually achieving this is not as straightforward as it might sound.\nWe don’t want to destructively modify the original data, because we would like to be able to provide data at multiple revisions of the repository, and to do that without storing multiple full-sized copies of the data. So we would like to store the changes in such a way that we can view the whole index at both revisions simultaneously.\nEven if we figure out a way to represent the changes, in practice it isn’t possible to achieve O(changes) for many programming languages. For example, in C++ if a header file is modified, we have to reprocess every source file that depends on it (directly or indirectly). We call this the fanout. So in practice the best we can do is O(fanout).\nGlean solves the first problem with an ingenious method of stacking immutable databases on top of each other. A stack of databases behaves just like a single database from the client’s perspective, but each layer in the stack can non-destructively add information to, or hide information from, the layers below. \n\nThe full details are beyond the scope of this post, for more on how incrementality works see: Incremental indexing with Glean.\nFinding the fanout of a set of changes is different for each language.  Interestingly the fanout can often be obtained using Glean queries: for example for C++, the fanout is calculated by finding all the files that #include one of the changed files, and then repeating that query until there are no more files to find.\nHow we use Glean at Meta\nCode navigation\nCode navigation at scale, on large monorepos containing millions of lines in diverse programming languages, is a challenging problem. But what makes it different from the code navigation support available in modern IDEs, other than scale? In our experience, code indexing a la Glean offers the following advantages over IDEs:\nInstantly available: Just open the code browser web app (our internal tool uses Monaco) and navigate without waiting for the IDE, build system, and LSP server to initialize\nMore widely available: You can integrate code navigation in pretty much any app that shows code! One particularly useful integration is in your code review tool (ours is called Phabricator), but more on that later.\nFull repo visibility: Glean allows you to, for example, find all the references to a function, not just the ones visible to the IDE. This is particularly useful for finding dead code, or finding clients of an API that you want to change.\nSymbol search for all the languages across the whole repository.\nCross language navigation: A common situation that comes up is a remote procedure call (RPC). When browsing the code you might want to jump to the service definition or, indeed, to the service implementation itself. Another case is languages with a foreign function interface (FFI), where you would like to browse from an FFI call to the corresponding definition in the target language.\nOur architecture for code navigation is based on Glass, a symbol server that abstracts all the complexities of Glean by implementing the usual code navigation logic in a simple but powerful API. The code browser needs only a single Glass API call, documentSymbols(repo,path,revision), to obtain a list of all the definitions and references in a source file, including source and target spans. The list of definitions is used to render an outline of the file, and the list of references to render underlines that can be hovered over or clicked to navigate. Finally, other code browser features like Find References or Call Hierarchy are also driven by API calls to Glass. \n\nThe code for Glass is also open-source, you can find it in glean/glass on GitHub.\nSpeeding up the IDE\nUsing an IDE such as VS Code on a large project, or a project with a large set of dependencies, or in a large monorepo tends to lead to a degraded experience as the IDE isn’t able to analyze all the code that you might want to explore. At Meta we’re using Glean to plug this gap for C++ developers: Because Glean has already analyzed the whole repository, C++ developers have access to basic functionality such as go-to-definition, find-references, and doc comment hovercards for the whole repository immediately on startup. As the IDE loads the files the developer is working on, the C++ language service seamlessly blends the Glean-provided data with that provided by the native clangd backend.\nOur target was C++ developers initially because that group typically has the worst IDE experience due to the long compile times, but the approach is not specific to C++ and we imagine other languages following the same path in the future.\nDocumentation generation\nThe data we store in Glean includes enough information to reconstruct the full details of an API: classes, methods, type signatures, inheritance, and so on. Glean also collects documentation from the source code when it uses the standard convention for the language, e.g., in C++ the convention is /// comment or /** comment */. With API data and documentation strings in Glean we can produce automatically-generated documentation on demand. \nHere’s an example page for the folly::Singleton type:\n\nThe data for these pages is produced by Glass and rendered by a client-side UI. The documentation is fully hyperlinked so the user can navigate around all the APIs throughout the repository easily. Meta engineers get consistent code documentation integrations across all the programming languages supported by Glean.\nSymbol IDs\nGlass assigns every symbol a symbol ID, a unique string that identifies the symbol. For example, the symbol ID for folly::Singleton would be something like, REPOSITORY/cpp/folly/Singleton. The symbol ID can be used to link directly to the documentation page for the symbol, so there’s a URL for every symbol that doesn’t change even if the symbol’s definition moves around. \nWe can use the symbol ID to request information about a symbol from Glass, for example to find all the references to the symbol throughout the repository. All of this works for every language, although the exact format for a symbol ID varies per language.\nAnalyzing code changes\nGlean indexing runs on diffs (think, “pull requests”) to extract a mechanical summary of the changeset that we call a diff sketch. For example, a diff might introduce a new class, remove a method, add a field to a type, introduce a new call to a function, and so on. The diff sketch lists all of these changes in a machine-readable form.\nDiff sketches are used to drive a simple static analysis that can identify potential issues that might require further review. They can also be used to drive non-trivial lint rules, rich notifications, and semantic search over commits. One example of the latter is connecting a production stack trace to recent commits that modified the affected function(s), to help root-cause performance issues or new failures.\nIndexing diffs also powers code navigation in our code review tools, giving code reviewers access to accurate go-to-definition on the code changes being reviewed, along with other code insights such as type-on-hover and documentation. This is a powerful lift to the code review process, making it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and provide valuable review feedback. At Meta this is enabled for a variety of different languages, including C++, Python, PHP, Javascript, Rust, Erlang, Thrift, and even Haskell.\nMore applications for Glean\nAside from the primary applications described above, Glean is also used to\nAnalyse build dependency graphs.\nDetect and remove dead code.\nTrack the progress of API migrations.\nMeasure various metrics that contribute to code complexity.\nTrack test coverage and select tests to run.\nAutomate data removal.\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) in AI coding assistants\nFurthermore, there are an ever-growing number of ad-hoc queries made by various people and systems to solve a variety of problems. Having a system like Glean means you can ask questions about your code: we don’t know all the questions we might want to ask, nor do we know all the data we might want to store, so Glean deliberately aims to be as general as possible on both of these fronts.\nTry Glean today\nVisit the Glean site for more details, technical documentation, and information on how to get started.\nThe post Indexing code at scale with Glean appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Berg*, David Casler^, Romain Cledat*, Qian Huang*, Rui Lin*, Nissan Pow*, Nurcan Sonmez*, Shashank Srikanth*, Chaoying Wang*, Regina Wang*, Darin Yu*\n*: Model Development Team, Machine Learning Platform\n^: Content Demand Modeling Team\nA month ago at QConSF, we showcased how Netflix utilizes Metaflow to power a diverse set of ML and AI use cases, managing thousands of unique Metaflow flows. This followed a previous blog on the same topic. Many of these projects are under constant development by dedicated teams with their own business goals and development best practices, such as the system that supports our content decision makers, or the system that ranks which language subtitles are most valuable for a specific piece of content.\nAs a central ML and AI platform team, our role is to empower our partner teams with tools that maximize their productivity and effectiveness, while adapting to their specific needs (not the other way around). This has been a guiding design principle with Metaflow since its inception.\nMetaflow infrastructure stack\nStanding on the shoulders of our extensive cloud infrastructure, Metaflow facilitates easy access to data, compute, and production-grade workflow orchestration, as well as built-in best practices for common concerns such as collaboration, versioning, dependency management, and observability, which teams use to setup ML/AI experiments and systems that work for them. As a result, Metaflow users at Netflix have been able to run millions of experiments over the past few years without wasting time on low-level concerns.\nA long standing FAQ: configurable flows\nWhile Metaflow aims to be un-opinionated about some of the upper levels of the stack, some teams within Netflix have developed their own opinionated tooling. As part of Metaflow’s adaptation to their specific needs, we constantly try to understand what has been developed and, more importantly, what gaps these solutions are filling.\nIn some cases, we determine that the gap being addressed is very team specific, or too opinionated at too high a level in the stack, and we therefore decide to not develop it within Metaflow. In other cases, however, we realize that we can develop an underlying construct that aids in filling that gap. Note that even in that case, we do not always aim to completely fill the gap and instead focus on extracting a more general lower level concept that can be leveraged by that particular user but also by others. One such recurring pattern we noticed at Netflix is the need to deploy sets of closely related flows, often as part of a larger pipeline involving table creations, ETLs, and deployment jobs. Frequently, practitioners want to experiment with variants of these flows, testing new data, new parameterizations, or new algorithms, while keeping the overall structure of the flow or flows intact.\nA natural solution is to make flows configurable using configuration files, so variants can be defined without changing the code. Thus far, there hasn’t been a built-in solution for configuring flows, so teams have built their bespoke solutions leveraging Metaflow’s JSON-typed Parameters, IncludeFile, and deploy-time Parameters or deploying their own home-grown solution (often with great pain). However, none of these solutions make it easy to configure all aspects of the flow’s behavior, decorators in particular.\nRequests for a feature like Metaflow Config\nOutside Netflix, we have seen similar frequently asked questions on the Metaflow community Slack as shown in the user quotes above:\n\nhow can I adjust the @resource requirements, such as CPU or memory, without having to hardcode the values in my flows?\nhow to adjust the triggering @schedule programmatically, so our production and staging deployments can run at different cadences?\n\nNew in Metaflow: Configs!\nToday, to answer the FAQ, we introduce a new — small but mighty — feature in Metaflow: a Config object. Configs complement the existing Metaflow constructs of artifacts and Parameters, by allowing you to configure all aspects of the flow, decorators in particular, prior to any run starting. At the end of the day, artifacts, Parameters and Configs are all stored as artifacts by Metaflow but they differ in when they are persisted as shown in the diagram below:\nDifferent data artifacts in Metaflow\nSaid another way:\n\nAn artifact is resolved and persisted to the datastore at the end of each task.\nA parameter is resolved and persisted at the start of a run; it can therefore be modified up to that point. One common use case is to use triggers to pass values to a run right before executing. Parameters can only be used within your step code.\nA config is resolved and persisted when the flow is deployed. When using a scheduler such as Argo Workflows, deployment happens when create’ing the flow. In the case of a local run, “deployment” happens just prior to the execution of the run — think of “deployment” as gathering all that is needed to run the flow. Unlike parameters, configs can be used more widely in your flow code, particularly, they can be used in step or flow level decorators as well as to set defaults for parameters. Configs can of course also be used within your flow.\n\nAs an example, you can specify a Config that reads a pleasantly human-readable configuration file, formatted as TOML. The Config specifies a triggering ‘@schedule’ and ‘@resource’ requirements, as well as application-specific parameters for this specific deployment:\n[schedule]\ncron = \"0 * * * *\"\n[model]\noptimizer = \"adam\"\nlearning_rate = 0.5\n[resources]\ncpu = 1\nUsing the newly released Metaflow 2.13, you can configure a flow with a Config like above, as demonstrated by this flow:\nimport pprint\nfrom metaflow import FlowSpec, step, Config, resources, config_expr, schedule\n@schedule(cron=config_expr(\"config.schedule.cron\"))\nclass ConfigurableFlow(FlowSpec):\n    config = Config(\"config\", default=\"myconfig.toml\", parser=\"tomllib.loads\")\n    @resources(cpu=config.resources.cpu)\n    @step\n    def start(self):\n        print(\"Config loaded:\")\n        pprint.pp(self.config)\n        self.next(self.end)\n    @step\n    def end(self):\n        pass\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    ConfigurableFlow()\nThere is a lot going on in the code above, a few highlights:\n\nyou can refer to configs before they have been defined using ‘config_expr’.\nyou can define arbitrary parsers — using a string means the parser doesn’t even have to be present remotely!\n\nFrom the developer’s point of view, Configs behave like dictionary-like artifacts. For convenience, they support the dot-syntax (when possible) for accessing keys, making it easy to access values in a nested configuration. You can also unpack the whole Config (or a subtree of it) with Python’s standard dictionary unpacking syntax, ‘**config’. The standard dictionary subscript notation is also available.\nSince Configs turn into dictionary artifacts, they get versioned and persisted automatically as artifacts. You can access Configs of any past runs easily through the Client API. As a result, your data, models, code, Parameters, Configs, and execution environments are all stored as a consistent bundle — neatly organized in Metaflow namespaces — paving the way for easily reproducible, consistent, low-boilerplate, and now easily configurable experiments and robust production deployments.\nMore than a humble config file\nWhile you can get far by accompanying your flow with a simple config file (stored in your favorite format, thanks to user-definable parsers), Configs unlock a number of advanced use cases. Consider these examples from the updated documentation:\n\nYou can choose the right level of runtime configurability versus fixed deployments by mixing Parameters and Configs. For instance, you can use a Config to define a default value for a parameter which can be overridden by a real-time event as a run is triggered.\nYou can define a custom parser to validate the configuration, e.g. using the popular Pydantic library.\nYou are not limited to using a single file: you can leverage a configuration manager like OmegaConf or Hydra to manage a hierarchy of cascading configuration files. You can also use a domain-specific tool for generating Configs, such as Netflix’s Metaboost which we cover below.\nYou can also generate configurations on the fly, e.g. fetch Configs from an external service, or inspect the execution environment, such as the current GIT branch, and include it as an extra piece of context in runs.\n\nA major benefit of Config over previous more hacky solutions for configuring flows is that they work seamlessly with other features of Metaflow: you can run steps remotely and deploy flows to production, even when relying on custom parsers, without having to worry about packaging Configs or parsers manually or keeping Configs consistent across tasks. Configs also work with the Runner and Deployer.\nThe Hollywood principle: don’t call us, we’ll call you\nWhen used in conjunction with a configuration manager like Hydra, Configs enable a pattern that is highly relevant for ML and AI use cases: orchestrating experiments over multiple configurations or sweeping over parameter spaces. While Metaflow has always supported sweeping over parameter grids easily using foreaches, it hasn’t been easily possible to alter the flow itself, e.g. to change @resources or @pypi/@conda dependencies for every experiment.\nIn a typical case, you trigger a Metaflow flow that consumes a configuration file, changing how a run behaves. With Hydra, you can invert the control: it is Hydra that decides what gets run based on a configuration file. Thanks to Metaflow’s new Runner and Deployer APIs, you can create a Hydra app that operates Metaflow programmatically — for instance, to deploy and execute hundreds of variants of a flow in a large-scale experiment.\nTake a look at two interesting examples of this pattern in the documentation. As a teaser, this video shows Hydra orchestrating deployment of tens of Metaflow flows, each of which benchmarks PyTorch using a varying number of CPU cores and tensor sizes, updating a visualization of the results in real-time as the experiment progresses:\nhttps://medium.com/media/e1e6d120dc74e75d9e52956b6cee7efe/href\nMetaboosting Metaflow — based on a true story\nTo give a motivating example of what configurations look like at Netflix in practice, let’s consider Metaboost, an internal Netflix CLI tool that helps ML practitioners manage, develop and execute their cross-platform projects, somewhat similar to the open-source Hydra discussed above but with specific integrations to the Netflix ecosystem. Metaboost is an example of an opinionated framework developed by a team already using Metaflow. In fact, a part of the inspiration for introducing Configs in Metaflow came from this very use case.\nMetaboost serves as a single interface to three different internal platforms at Netflix that manage ETL/Workflows (Maestro), Machine Learning Pipelines (Metaflow) and Data Warehouse Tables (Kragle). In this context, having a single configuration system to manage a ML project holistically gives users increased project coherence and decreased project risk.\nConfiguration in Metaboost\nEase of configuration and templatizing are core values of Metaboost. Templatizing in Metaboost is achieved through the concept of bindings, wherein we can bind a Metaflow pipeline to an arbitrary label, and then create a corresponding bespoke configuration for that label. The binding-connected configuration is then merged into a global set of configurations containing such information as GIT repository, branch, etc. Binding a Metaflow, will also signal to Metaboost that it should instantiate the Metaflow flow once per binding into our orchestration cluster.\nImagine a ML practitioner on the Netflix Content ML team, sourcing features from hundreds of columns in our data warehouse, and creating a multitude of models against a growing suite of metrics. When a brand new content metric comes along, with Metaboost, the first version of the metric’s predictive model can easily be created by simply swapping the target column against which the model is trained.\nSubsequent versions of the model will result from experimenting with hyper parameters, tweaking feature engineering, or conducting feature diets. Metaboost’s bindings, and their integration with Metaflow Configs, can be leveraged to scale the number of experiments as fast as a scientist can create experiment based configurations.\nScaling experiments with Metaboost bindings — backed by Metaflow Config\nConsider a Metaboost ML project named `demo` that creates and loads data to custom tables (ETL managed by Maestro), and then trains a simple model on this data (ML Pipeline managed by Metaflow). The project structure of this repository might look like the following:\n├── metaflows\n│   ├── custom                               -> custom python code, used by\n|   |   |                                       Metaflow\n│   │   ├── data.py\n│   │   └── model.py\n│   └── training.py                          -> defines our Metaflow pipeline\n├── schemas\n│   ├── demo_features_f.tbl.yaml             -> table DDL, stores our ETL\n|   |                                           output, Metaflow input\n│   └── demo_predictions_f.tbl.yaml          -> table DDL,\n|                                               stores our Metaflow output\n├── settings\n│   ├── settings.configuration.EXP_01.yaml   -> defines the additive\n|   |                                           config for Experiment 1\n│   ├── settings.configuration.EXP_02.yaml   -> defines the additive\n|   |                                           config for Experiment 2\n│   ├── settings.configuration.yaml          -> defines our global\n|   |                                           configuration\n│   └── settings.environment.yaml            -> defines parameters based on\n|                                               git branch (e.g. READ_DB)\n├── tests\n├── workflows\n│   ├── sql\n│   ├── demo.demo_features_f.sch.yaml        -> Maestro workflow, defines ETL\n│   └── demo.main.sch.yaml                   -> Maestro workflow, orchestrates\n|                                               ETLs and Metaflow\n└── metaboost.yaml                           -> defines our project for\n                                                Metaboost\nThe configuration files in the settings directory above contain the following YAML files:\n# settings.configuration.yaml (global configuration)\nmodel:\n  fit_intercept: True\nconda:\n  numpy: '1.22.4'\n  \"scikit-learn\": '1.4.0'\n# settings.configuration.EXP_01.yaml\ntarget_column: metricA\nfeatures:\n  - runtime\n  - content_type\n  - top_billed_talent\n# settings.configuration.EXP_02.yaml\ntarget_column: metricA\nfeatures:\n  - runtime\n  - director\n  - box_office\nMetaboost will merge each experiment configuration (*.EXP*.yaml) into the global configuration (settings.configuration.yaml) individually at Metaboost command initialization. Let’s take a look at how Metaboost combines these configurations with a Metaboost command:\n(venv-demo) ~/projects/metaboost-demo [branch=demoX] \n$ metaboost metaflow settings show --yaml-path=configuration\nbinding=EXP_01:\nmodel:                     -> defined in setting.configuration.yaml (global)\n  fit_intercept: true\nconda:                     -> defined in setting.configuration.yaml (global)\n  numpy: 1.22.4\n  \"scikit-learn\": 1.4.0\ntarget_column: metricA     -> defined in setting.configuration.EXP_01.yaml\nfeatures:                  -> defined in setting.configuration.EXP_01.yaml\n- runtime\n- content_type\n- top_billed_talent\nbinding=EXP_02:\nmodel:                     -> defined in setting.configuration.yaml (global)\n  fit_intercept: true\nconda:                     -> defined in setting.configuration.yaml (global)\n  numpy: 1.22.4\n  \"scikit-learn\": 1.4.0\ntarget_column: metricA     -> defined in setting.configuration.EXP_02.yaml\nfeatures:                  -> defined in setting.configuration.EXP_02.yaml\n- runtime\n- director\n- box_office\nMetaboost understands it should deploy/run two independent instances of training.py — one for the EXP_01 binding and one for the EXP_02 binding. You can also see that Metaboost is aware that the tables and ETL workflows are not bound, and should only be deployed once. These details of which artifacts to bind and which to leave unbound are encoded in the project’s top-level metaboost.yaml file.\n(venv-demo) ~/projects/metaboost-demo [branch=demoX] \n$ metaboost project list\nTables (metaboost table list):\nschemas/demo_predictions_f.tbl.yaml (binding=default):\n    table_path=prodhive/demo_db/demo_predictions_f\nschemas/demo_features_f.tbl.yaml (binding=default):\n    table_path=prodhive/demo_db/demo_features_f\nWorkflows (metaboost workflow list):\nworkflows/demo.demo_features_f.sch.yaml (binding=default):\n    cluster=sandbox, workflow.id=demo.branch_demox.demo_features_f\nworkflows/demo.main.sch.yaml (binding=default):\n    cluster=sandbox, workflow.id=demo.branch_demox.main\nMetaflows (metaboost metaflow list):\nmetaflows/training.py (binding=EXP_01): -> EXP_01 instance of training.py\n    cluster=sandbox, workflow.id=demo.branch_demox.EXP_01.training   \nmetaflows/training.py (binding=EXP_02): -> EXP_02 instance of training.py\n    cluster=sandbox, workflow.id=demo.branch_demox.EXP_02.training\nBelow is a simple Metaflow pipeline that fetches data, executes feature engineering, and trains a LinearRegression model. The work to integrate Metaboost Settings into a user’s Metaflow pipeline (implemented using Metaflow Configs) is as easy as adding a single mix-in to the FlowSpec definition:\nfrom metaflow import FlowSpec, Parameter, conda_base, step\nfrom custom.data import feature_engineer, get_data\nfrom metaflow.metaboost import MetaboostSettings\n@conda_base(\n    libraries=MetaboostSettings.get_deploy_time_settings(\"configuration.conda\")\n)class DemoTraining(FlowSpec, MetaboostSettings):\n    prediction_date = Parameter(\"prediction_date\", type=int, default=-1)\n    @step\n    def start(self):\n        # get show_settings() for free with the mixin\n        # and get convenient debugging info\n        self.show_settings(exclude_patterns=[\"artifact*\", \"system*\"])\n        self.next(self.get_features)\n    @step\n    def get_features(self):\n        # feature engineers on our extracted data\n        self.fe_df = feature_engineer(\n            # loads data from our ETL pipeline\n            data=get_data(prediction_date=self.prediction_date),\n            features=self.settings.configuration.features +\n                [self.settings.configuration.target_column]\n        )\n        self.next(self.train)\n    @step\n    def train(self):\n        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n        # trains our model\n        self.model = LinearRegression(\n            fit_intercept=self.settings.configuration.model.fit_intercept\n        ).fit(\n            X=self.fe_df[self.settings.configuration.features],\n            y=self.fe_df[self.settings.configuration.target_column]\n        )\n        print(f\"Fit slope: {self.model.coef_[0]}\")\n        print(f\"Fit intercept: {self.model.intercept_}\")\n        self.next(self.end)\n    @step\n    def end(self):\n        pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    DemoTraining()\nThe Metaflow Config is added to the FlowSpec by mixing in the MetaboostSettings class. Referencing a configuration value is as easy as using the dot syntax to drill into whichever parameter you’d like.\nFinally let’s take a look at the output from our sample Metaflow above. We execute experiment EXP_01 with\nmetaboost metaflow run --binding=EXP_01\nwhich upon execution will merge the configurations into a single settings file (shown previously) and serialize it as a yaml file to the .metaboost/settings/compiled/ directory.\nYou can see the actual command and args that were sub-processed in the Metaboost Execution section below. Please note the –config argument pointing to the serialized yaml file, and then subsequently accessible via self.settings. Also note the convenient printing of configuration values to stdout during the start step using a mixed in function named show_settings().\n(venv-demo) ~/projects/metaboost-demo [branch=demoX] \n$ metaboost metaflow run --binding=EXP_01\nMetaboost Execution: \n - python3.10 /root/repos/cdm-metaboost-irl/metaflows/training.py\n   --no-pylint --package-suffixes=.py --environment=conda\n   --config settings\n   .metaboost/settings/compiled/settings.branch_demox.EXP_01.training.mP4eIStG.yaml\n   run --prediction_date20241006\nMetaflow 2.12.39+nflxfastdata(2.13.5);nflx(2.13.5);metaboost(0.0.27)\n  executing DemoTraining for user:dcasler\nValidating your flow...\n    The graph looks good!\nBootstrapping Conda environment...

It employs a configuration system that combines git based parameters, global configurations and arbitrarily bound configuration files for use during execution against internal Netflix platforms.\nIntegrating this configuration system with the new Config in Metaflow is incredibly simple (by design), only requiring users to add a mix-in class to their FlowSpec — similar to this example in Metaflow documentation — and then reference the configuration values in steps or decorators. The example above templatizes a training Metaflow for the sake of experimentation, but users could just as easily use bindings/configs to templatize their flows across target metrics, business initiatives or any other arbitrary lines of work.\nTry it at home\nIt couldn’t be easier to get started with Configs! Just\npip install -U metaflow\nto get the latest version and head to the updated documentation for examples. If you are impatient, you can find and execute all config-related examples in this repository as well.\nIf you have any questions or feedback about Config (or other Metaflow features), you can reach out to us at the Metaflow community Slack.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Outerbounds for their collaboration on this feature; for rigorously testing it and developing a repository of examples to showcase some of the possibilities offered by this feature.\n\nIntroducing Configurable Metaflow was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Year in Review\nTime flies. Only a year ago, we saw the release of Scala 3.4.0-RC1, and now we’re trying out Scala 3.6.2 with many new experimental features. The last 12 months have brought many new features to the IntelliJ Scala Plugin as well. A year ago we introduced X-Ray mode, which lets you easily augment the code you see in the editor with information about inferred types and other details. We’ve improved Scala 3 support, compiler-based highlighting, and the debugger. We’ve improved auto-completion, both the standard and the AI-powered versions. We’ve introduced support for named tuples, which are still an experimental feature, and we’ve implemented a new way to work with sbt projects. On top of all that, this year, JetBrains joined the Scala Advisory Board. You can read about those changes in our release notes and other blog posts:\nThe X-Ray Mode\nRelease Notes 2024.1\nRelease Notes 2024.2\nRelease Notes 2024.3\nNew Module Layout for sbt Projects\nJetBrains Joins the Scala Advisory Board\n\n\n\n\nState of Developer Ecosystem Survey\nThis year, JetBrains conducted its eighth annual State of Developer Ecosystem Survey. We compared your answers about your Scala development preferences to the results from last year, and we learned a few interesting things:\nWhich versions of Scala do you regularly use?\nThe most significant shift is the jump in Scala 3 usage from 45% in 2023 to 51% in 2024. However, the usage of Scala 2.13 fell a little bit, and even Scala 2.12, though it lost popularity, sits at a modest 23%. What can we make of this? The additional breakdown of responses regarding which versions are used at work and which are used for hobby projects gave us a pretty clear picture. The community has embraced Scala 3 in open-source projects, libraries, and new projects written from scratch, but Scala 2.13 still plays a prominent role in the professional world.\n\nWhich Scala 3 features do you use?\nWhen it comes to adopting Scala 3 features, the features with the most growth (enums, given and using clauses, top-level definitions) are those that simplify common patterns or reduce boilerplate. This suggests developers prioritize tools that enhance productivity and readability. Other, more advanced features have also become more popular, which corresponds to the rise in popularity of Scala 3 overall. Niche features – like dependent function types and kind polymorphism – will likely remain specialized tools for advanced library authors or specific applications.\nNext year, we will move this question from the main Developer Ecosystem Survey to a separate small opinion poll.\n\nWhich unit testing frameworks do you regularly use, if any?\nWith 71% of users, ScalaTest is the clear leader. This reflects its maturity, ease of use, and extensive feature set – all reasons why many teams see it as a go-to solution. MUnit and ScalaCheck have retained stable fan bases, even though they both lost a few points. On the other hand, the decline of ZIO Test’s popularity might be surprising, given that ZIO remains a popular framework.\n\nWhich frameworks and libraries do you regularly use?\nCats has experienced a small rise, solidifying its position as one of the most widely used libraries in the Scala ecosystem. This trend might be connected with a shift toward more rigorous functional programming in the community since F2 and ZIO, both mature projects built on functional programming principles, also experienced small bumps.\nAkka lost 5 points but maintained a solid user base. It looks like Pekko, a fully open-source fork of Akka, has attracted some Akka users seeking a familiar framework without licensing constraints. This is the first year we have asked about Pekko in the Developer Ecosystem Survey, and it already has a 15% share of the responses.\nThe other libraries either maintained their user bases or experienced slight losses. This may mean that Scala development is moving towards and consolidating around tried and trustworthy solutions. Scala developers still like to experiment but we leave it more for hobby projects, sticking instead to what we know in our full-time jobs. The results for frameworks and libraries used in web development seem to confirm this conclusion: not much has changed; we still see the dominance of a few mature solutions without any new experimental projects significantly rising in popularity.\n\n\n\n\nWhich editors or IDEs do you use for Scala development?\nFinally, when it comes to the popularity of IDEs and editors used to write Scala code, IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala Plugin is still on top at 80%. VS Code is next with 25%, and Emacs and Vim are in third and fourth place. Many people don’t use just one IDE for all their work, which is why the results don’t add up to 100%. As we already learned from the questions about Scala 3 and its features, Scala developers like to experiment in their hobby projects, but they stick to mature solutions in their professional work. Maybe this explains these results as well.\n\nShare of top-paid employees\nAnd one more thing before we finish: This year’s Developer Ecosystem Survey shows that, just as in 2023, Scala is the programming language with the largest percentage of top-paid developers, i.e. those whose salaries are in the top quartile of their country or region.\n\nCheck out the State of Developer Ecosystem Report to learn more about the results.\nTo conclude, we wish you a peaceful end of the year, a lovely holiday season, and… happy development!\nThe IntelliJ Scala Plugin team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve begun work on our next major release, 2025.1, which we’ll introduce early next year. After reading through your valuable feedback and feature requests, and taking into account our own strategic goals, we’ve prioritized the following areas for development:\n🚀 The CLion Nova language engine\n🛠️ The debugger \n🤖 Embedded development\n🏗️ Project formats and build tools\nRead on to learn more about our planned updates.\nOur team is committed to creating an IDE that makes development smooth and productive. However, the following is a preliminary roadmap only – we can’t guarantee that all the issues listed below will be addressed in CLion 2025.1. It’s possible that unforeseen circumstances could require us to modify our plans or implementation timelines for some items.\nCLion Nova\nWe’re still working to improve our new, faster, and more powerful CLion Nova language engine by optimizing its performance and expanding its feature set. With each passing day, it’s becoming even more capable of serving as the default engine for all users, new and existing.\nFor the 2025.1 release, our CLion Nova development efforts will focus on some of the most requested features, including out-of-project file support, multiple settings and actions, and smart keys.\nOut-of-project files\nCLion Nova doesn’t properly support header and source files that are not included in a project and, therefore, doesn’t provide the necessary information about a compiler. This causes various problems with code analysis and code assistance.\nSupport for these kinds of out-of-project files in CLion Nova is one of the most anticipated features we’ve been working on for upcoming releases (CPP-38040). We’re pleased to report that we’ve made some progress in this area and hope to introduce this feature in 2025.1. \nIt’s worth mentioning that, historically, the ReSharper C++ backend used in CLion Nova was designed to work with projects where every file, including header files, is explicitly mentioned in the build scripts. This is not the case for most build systems CLion supports. For this reason, we need to restore the set of tradeoffs and heuristics that CLion Classic uses for such cases.\nWith this in mind, it would be helpful if you could share any use cases involving header files that are not included anywhere else in your project or source files that are not used during the build process. Would you like for them to be included in project-wide actions like Find Usages? Or would you like to see error highlighting there? Please share your use cases in the ticket or in the comments section below.\nSettings and actions\nWe plan to implement several settings and actions available in CLion Classic but missing in CLion Nova, which will make development with the new engine more convenient. These include:\nC/C++ auto-import options, such as Auto import local files with quotes and Auto import on completion (CPP-35360).\nStyle settings for header guards, which help keep their names according to the format you prefer and allow you to create custom templates (CPP-36933).\nThe ability to move a caret to a code block end or start using a shortcut (CPP-36147).\nSmart keys\nSmart keys are editor actions that allow you to write code faster and make working in the IDE even smoother. Several of these actions are available in CLion Classic but are still missing in CLion Nova. Here are some of the smart keys we’ll be adding in the next release:\nJump outside closing bracket/quote with Tab when typing (CPP-24705).\nUnindent on Backspace (CPP-35995).\nReformat block on typing `}` (CPP-38777).\nDebugger\nRegarding new debugger features for v2025.1, we plan to focus on some of the most long-awaited, such as:\nQt pretty printers: We’ll add support for Qt pretty printers to improve the readability of Qt variables, arrays, and other data types during debugging (CPP-605).\nCustom LLDB binary: Users who can’t use the CLion’s bundled LLDB will soon be able to switch to a custom LLDB binary (CPP-3589).\nEmbedded development\nFor embedded development, we’re focusing on improving debug servers and adding the ability to monitor variables and memory values in real-time while debugging.\nDebug servers\nWe’re continuing to refine our experimental Debug Servers configuration option introduced in v2024.3. This option allows you to configure a debug server for a specific debug probe and use it to run or debug a build target. As a result, debug servers make it easier to set up and run debugging for embedded and remote development.\nFor the next release, we’ll make the feature easier to configure by adding the following:\nESP32 Debug Server: In addition to the Generic and SEGGER J-Link preconfigured debug server templates, we’ll add a new template for ESP32 MCUs. This will simplify flashing these chips and debugging applications.\nUX improvements: We also plan to improve the user experience when working with debug servers, focusing on streamlining the setup process and the Debug Servers dialog UI.\n\n\n\n\nWe encourage you to try the Debug Servers option and share your feedback. To do so, use Help | Submit Feedback… in the main IDE menu or leave a comment under this post.\nWatching variable values and memory changes in real time\nObserving variable values and memory changes in real time without stopping a program is critical for many embedded developers. It allows them to monitor the device state and application performance, which is especially helpful for testing and error detection.\nIf you’re a developer waiting for this feature, or are interested in trying it, we’d appreciate it if you’d take a few minutes to fill out our survey and share your use cases and challenges. This will help us address the most important user needs and improve the feature.\nProject formats and build tools\nAmong the many enhancements to project formats and build tools, the most significant relate to support for Zephyr, Bazel, and a remote Docker toolchain.\nSysbuild support for Zephyr\nOne of the Zephyr-related updates planned for the upcoming release is support for sysbuild. This is a high-level build system that combines other build systems, such as West and CMake. The main strength of sysbuild is that it provides the ability to build multiple images for boards with multiple SoCs (systems on chip) or SoCs with multiple CPU cores. Another popular example of using sysbuild is when one application is built for a boot loader while another is built for the core CPU.\nBazel plugin enhancements\nWe’re planning several improvements to CLion’s Bazel support, the most important of which are as follows:\nSupport for qsync to import C/C++ projects: Query sync, or qsync, is one of the two ways to import Bazel projects for C/C++. The other is aspect sync, which CLion currently uses. In short, qsync is faster because it allows you to import only the parts of a project that you need. We aim to add basic support for qsync in the next release (CPP-42253).\nSupport for Google Test and Catch2 when working with Bazel projects using CLion Nova. We’ve already added this to v2024.12.17 of the Bazel plugin, and it will be available in CLion Nova soon.\nThe latest CMake and CMake Presets versions\nIn the previous release, we updated the CMake bundle to 3.30. For CLion v2025.1, we plan to update the build system to the latest CMake, v3.31, which will also include support for CMake Prestes v10. CMake Presets are useful when you want to specify common build options and share them with other users.\nRemote Docker toolchain\nCurrently, CLion’s Docker toolchain only allows working with containers locally. There are two modes for working with containers running remotely: via Gateway and with local sources. In v2025.1, we plan to add support for a remote Docker toolchain, allowing users to work with remote containers via an SSH connection (CPP-42340).\nCall for feedback\nWe value your feedback – your experiences and insights are essential to our mission to continuously improve CLion. Please share your ideas in the comments section below or submit them to our issue tracker.\nThe free Early Access Program, which will give you the chance to try all of the new features planned for the next major release, is just around the corner. In the meantime, upgrade to CLion 2024.3 if you haven’t already done so, and let us know what you think!\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3",

In the past, for example with Azure Storage, we’d inject the entire connection string into your configuration. With this update, we’ve removed the secrets from the UX – and from what we save to configuration – altogether. This means your code has fewer secrets in it, so you won’t push those into your source control repository inadvertently.\n\nIntegrated authentication, by default\nPrior to this update, Connected Services would inject secret-inclusive connection strings for resources like Azure Storage into your secrets. If you were using secrets.json for local storage, this would result in your secrets being stored in files on disk.\n\nAfter this update, your secrets.json will contain no actual secrets, but rather the Azure Storage endpoints for your service instance. Using the latest Azure SDKs, your code connects to your Azure resources using your Visual Studio or Azure CLI login. Locally, your logged-in credential does the magic; in Azure, the app service’s managed identity takes over!\n\nBenefits with this update\nEnhanced security: Fewer secrets on disk means your development process is automatically more secure, since you mitigate the potential for these secrets to be inadvertently committed to source control.\nSimplified development and deployment: Focus on what you do best – coding – while Connected Services handles the tedious parts, more securely than ever.\nAutomated configuration: During publishing, your app is seamlessly configured with the necessary identity and roles needed to access resources, making the process smoother than ever.\nThank You for Your Feedback\nYour invaluable feedback drives our continuous improvement. We’re thrilled to bring you these enhancements and can’t wait to hear about your experiences with the new Connected Services feature.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 introduces a new feature to improve the security of publishing applications to Azure App Service. This feature is designed to disable Basic Authentication and enable integrated security for a more secure publishing process.\n\nBasic Authentication has been identified as a less secure method for managing app deployments. Visual Studio 2022 addresses this issue by offering you an option to disable Basic Authentication, which enhances security by using integrated authentication.\nThe problem with Basic Authentication\nBasic Authentication involves sending user credentials in a format that is not highly secure, making it vulnerable to interception. This poses a risk to the integrity of applications.\nSecure publishing with integrated authentication\nThe new feature in Visual Studio 2022 disables Basic Authentication and enables integrated security for publishing to Azure App Service. This ensures that publishing credentials is handled securely, reducing the risks associated with Basic Authentication.\nWhen publishing to an Azure App Service that has Basic Authentication enabled (which is not recommended), users will see the Turn on Basic Authentication option, and it will be unchecked by default. Customers who need to retain Basic Authentication can check the box, but given the recommendation is to disable Basic Authentication it’s unchecked by default, so you start secure if this is the first time you’re publishing or, you get secure once you go through the publishing process after you update Visual Studio.\n\nIf you’ve created the Web App recently via the portal or this or any future version of Visual Studio, Basic Authentication will be disabled by default. For any Web App that’s already got Basic Authentication disabled, we circumvent inadvertently making the Web App less secure by disabling the checkbox altogether, so you stay secure.\n\nThis feature improves the overall security of the publishing process, ensuring that sensitive credentials are not exposed. It also simplifies the process by defaulting to a more secure option, reducing the need for manual security configurations. If, at any point, you need to re-enable Basic Authentication, this is always possible in the Azure Portal.\nConclusion\nWe deeply appreciate your invaluable feedback, which plays a crucial role in enhancing Visual Studio. Thank you for being a vital part of our community.\nThe post Security updates to Azure publishing from Visual Studio appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "페도라 리눅스를 처음 설치하면 쓸데없는 패키지 저장소(dnf repository)들이 기본으로 많이 설치된다. 따라서 dnf 명령을 내릴 때마다 속도가 상당히 느려진다. 만일 약간의 시간을 들여서 저장소 설정를 튜닝해주면 dnf 명령시 패키지 검색이나 다운로드 속도가 많이 개선된다.\nDNF 저장소 튜닝은 크게 3가지이다. 첫째는 불필요한 저장소를 비활성화하는 것이다. 둘째는 저장소를 자주 업데이트하지 않도록 expiration 시간을 늘려주는 것이다. 세번째는 국내 미러 사이트를 직접 접속하도록 지정하는 방법이다.\nFedora DNF5\n\n\n \n1. 불필요한 저장소 비활성화\n현재 저장소 목록을 확인하기 위해 dnf repolist 명령을 내려보면 이런저런 저장소가 많이 보인다. 기본적으로 활성화된(enabled) 저장소만 나타난다. 비활성활된 저장소 목록까지 모두 포함해서 보려면 --all 옵션을 추가하여 dnf repolist --all이라고 명령한다. 반대로 비활성화된 목록만 볼 때는 --disabled 옵션을 사용해서 dnf repolist --disabled 라고 명령하면 된다.\n# dnf repolist\nrepo id                                                                             repo name\ncopr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:atim:gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons             Copr repo for gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons owned by atim\ncopr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:phracek:PyCharm                                      Copr repo for PyCharm owned by phracek\ndocker-ce-stable                                                                    Docker CE Stable -

x86_64 - Updates\n위 저장소 목록들이 어떤 역할을 하는지는 우측에 설명(repo name)이 나와있다. 중요한 것들로는 fedora는 기본 패키지들이 있는 곳이고, updates는 업데이트 된 패키지들이 들어있다. rpmfusion은 기본적으로 추가적인 패키지들을 제공하는 저장소이다. 이외에 remi나 vscode, google-chrome 등도 많이 사용하는데 설치 후 쓸데없이 활성화 되어있으면 dnf 명령을 느리게 한다.\n \n1.1. dnf config-manager 명령어 사용하기\n저장소 중에 docker-ce-stable을 비활성화하기 위해 아래와 같이 config-manager 기능을 사용해보자. 비활성화는 enabled=0 으로 속성을 변경하는 것이고, 이는 실제로는 /etc/yum.repos.d/docker-ce-stable.repo 파일의 enabled=0 항목을 설정하는 것과 같다. 반대로 enabled=1이 되면 활성화된다. 설정 변경후 dnf repolist 를 내려보면 docker-ce-stable이 사라진 것을 볼 수 있다.\n# dnf config-manager setopt docker-ce-stable.enabled=0\n\n# dnf repolist\nrepo id                                                                             repo name\ncopr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:atim:gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons             Copr repo for gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons owned by atim\ncopr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:phracek:PyCharm                                      Copr repo for PyCharm owned by phracek\nfedora                                                                              Fedora 41 -

x86_64 - Updates\n이렇게 PyCharm이나 gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons, rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver, rpmfusion-nonfree-steam도 비활성화해보자. 구글 크롬 저장소인 google-chrome도 자주 업데이트 하지 않는다면 비활성화 해두면 좋다. 가끔 1~2개월마다 업데이트 하라고 할 때만 잠시 활성화 해서 업데이트하면 된다. 이럴 때는 dnf --enable-repo=google-chrome 옵션을 추가해서 업데이트하면 잠시 활성화 될 뿐 전체 설정을 건드리지는 않는다.\n# dnf config-manager setopt copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:atim:gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons.enabled=0\n\n# dnf config-manager setopt copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:phracek:PyCharm.enabled=0\n\n# dnf config-manager setopt rpmfusion-nonfree-steam.enabled=0\n\n# dnf config-manager setopt rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver.enabled=0\n\n#  dnf config-manager setopt google-chrome.enabled=0\n\n# dnf repolist\nrepo id                                                       repo name\nfedora                                                        Fedora 41 -

Updates\n이제 활성화된 저장소의 갯수가 7개로 줄었다. 이 정도만 해둬도 dnf 명령이 상당히 빨라진다. 처음 설치 이후 새로운 패키지를 거의 설치하지 않는 경우라면 fedora도 빼도 된다.\n여기서 좀 더 타이트하게 하려면 rpmfusion-free와 rpmfusion-nonfree도 비활성화하면 더 빨라진다.\n \n1.2. dnf config-manager의 작동 방식 이해하기\n저장소 파일은 /etc/yum.repos.d에 있지만 이 파일들을 직접 수정하면 나중에 저장소 패키지가 업데이트 될 때 덮어 쓰여진다. 따라서 dnf에서는 override 기법을 이용하여 추가 설정한다.\ndnf의 오버라이드 설정 파일의 위치는 /etc/dnf/repos.override.d 디렉토리에 있다. 앞서 설정한 부분이 여기에 어떻게 저장되는지 살펴보자.\n # cd /etc/dnf/repos.override.d\n \n # ls\n 99-config_manager.repo\n\n# cat 99-config_manager.repo\n# Generated by dnf5 config-manager.\n# Do not modify this file manually, use dnf5 config-manager instead.\n[docker-ce-stable]\nenabled=0\n[copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:atim:gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons]\nenabled=0\n[copr:copr.fedorainfracloud.org:phracek:PyCharm]\nenabled=0\n[rpmfusion-nonfree-steam]\nenabled=0\n[rpmfusion-nonfree-nvidia-driver]\nenabled=0\n[google-chrome]\nenabled=0\n오버라이딩 설정 파일인 99-config_manager.repo 를 보면 어떤 방식으로 저장되는지 직관적으로 알 수 있다. 이 파일을 직접 vim으로 수정해도 결과는 같지만, 주석문에 Do not modify... 쓰여있듯이 직접 수정하는 것은 좋지 않다. (어느 정도 리눅스 전문가라면 무시하고 직접 편집해도 된다. 애초에 전문가라면 이런 초보 글을 읽지도 않겠지만...)\nsetopt로 설정한 값을 변경하는게 아니라 아예 제거해야 하는 경우, 즉 default값으로 되돌리려면 unsetopt를 사용하면 된다. unsetopt를 사용할 때는 뒤의 값은 적을 필요가 없다. 예를 들어 dnf config-manager unsetopt docker-ce-stable.enabled 식으로만 명령하면 된다.\n참고로 dnf config-manager는 wildcard를 지원한다. 따라서 rpmfusion으로 시작하는 모든 저장소를 disabled 하려면 아래와 같이 와일드카드를 사용해서 명령할 수 있다.\n# dnf config-manager setopt rpmfusion-*.enabled=0\n\n# dnf repo list\nrepo id                                                       repo name\nfedora                                                        Fedora 41 - x86_64\nupdates                                                       Fedora 41 - x86_64 - Updates\n \n1.3. 구형 dnf 기능인 --disable 옵션\n간혹 옛날 명령인 dnf config-manager --disable docker-ce-stable 같이 명령하는 경우가 있는데, 이건 옛날 dnf 의 기능이고, 최신의 dnf에서는 삭제되었다. 최신의 dnf 에서 이 명령을 사용하면 아래와 같이 에러가 발생한다.\n# dnf config-manager --disable docker-ce-stable\nUnknown argument \"--disable\" for command \"config-manager\". Add \"--help\" for more information about the arguments.\n \n \n2. expire 시간 늘리기\ndnf 명령을 내릴 때 마다 목록을 자주 받아오면 그것만큼 귀찮은 것이 없다. 패키지 목록은 자주 변경되는 것이 아니므로 expire 시간을 좀 넉넉하게 해주면 편리하다. 예를 들어 updates 저장소의 expire 시간을 12시간 혹은 1일로 변경하는 명령을 살펴보면 다음과 같다.\n# dnf config-manager setopt updates.metadata_expire=12h\n\n# tail -4 /etc/dnf/repos.override.d/99-config_manager.repo\n[google-chrome]\nenabled=0\n[updates]\nmetadata_expire=12h\n위의 12h를 1d로 변경하는 것은 직접 연습해 보기를 바란다. 그리고 rpmfusion이나 다른 저장소도 12h나 1d로 변경해보자.\n그런데 expire를 무시하고 당장 업데이트 받아야 하는 경우가 있다면 dnf clean all로 모든 캐시를 지우고 명령하면 모든 데이터를 처음부터 다시 받을 수 있다. 캐시만 다시 받을 경우에는 dnf makecache 명령을 쓰면 된다.\n \n3. 미러 사이트 설정하기\n기본적으로 dnf는 실행할 때 미러 사이트를 탐색하는 방식을 사용하는데, 이게 생각보다 똑똑한 편이 아니다. 예를 들어 dnf -y update 명령을 실행할 때 가끔은 느린 사이트로 연결되어 속도가 엄청 느려진다. 이런 경우에는 CTRL-C로 dnf 를 끊고 다시 명령하면 빠른 사이트로 접속되는 경우도 있다. 하지만 계속 느린 사이트로 붙으면 상당히 귀찮아진다. 그래서 애초에 한국의 미러 사이트로 고정해두면 이런 걱정을 안해도 된다. (미국에 있다면 미국의 사이트로, 호주에 있다면 호주의 사이트로 자국내 사이트로 연결해두는 것이 좋다)\n미러 사이트 목록은 아래 주소에서 볼 수 있다. 마지막의 41은 버전 숫자이다.\n https://mirrormanager.fedoraproject.org/mirrors/Fedora/41 \n목록에 보면  중에서 KR 코드가 한국의 미러 사이트이다. 이 중에서 5번째 숫자가 대역폭인데, 대역폭이 높을 수록 좋은 편이다. 대역폭만 보면 카이스트가 좋지만, 자잘한 버그가 많아서 사실상 관리가 잘되는 것은 아니다. 그래서 2024년 12월 기준으로는 cicku의 미러 사이트가 더 좋은 편이다.\nFedora mirror sites - KR (Korea)\n\n\n먼저 현재 updates 저장소의 상태를 살펴보기 위해 dnf repo info updates 명령을 내려보자.\n# dnf repo info updates\nUpdating and loading repositories:\nRepositories loaded.\nRepo ID              : updates\nName                 : Fedora 41 -

When the original flow emits a new value, the previous flow produced by transform block is cancelled.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>제미나이에게 해석을 요청한 부분은 다음과 같다.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>이 코드는 원본 flow가 값을 내보낼 때마다 transform 함수에 의해 생성된 새로운 flow로 전환하는 flow를 반환합니다.</p>\n\n<p>좀 더 자세히 설명하면,</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>flow는 코루틴에서 비동기적으로 데이터를 처리하는 데 사용되는 자료 구조입니다. 마치 시간에 따라 값을 내보내는 스트림과 같습니다.</li>\n  <li>transform은 flow의 각 값을 변환하는 함수입니다. 이 함수는 새로운 flow를 생성할 수도 있습니다.\nflatMapLatest는 flow의 각 값에 대해 transform 함수를 호출하여 새로운 flow를 생성하고, 이 flow들의 값을 순차적으로 내보내는 연산자입니다.</li>\n  <li>중요한 점은, 원본 flow가 새로운 값을 내보낼 때마다 이전에 transform 함수에 의해 생성된 flow는 취소된다는 것입니다. 즉, 항상 최신 값에 대한 flow만 활성화됩니다.\n예를 들어, 사용자가 검색어를 입력할 때마다 검색 결과를 가져오는 flow가 있다고 가정해 보겠습니다. flatMapLatest를 사용하면 사용자가 새로운 검색어를 입력할 때마다 이전 검색 결과에 대한 flow는 취소되고 새로운 검색어에 대한 flow가 생성됩니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>이러한 방식은 최신 값만 처리해야 하는 경우에 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 사용자 인터페이스에서 최신 데이터만 표시해야 하는 경우 flatMapLatest를 사용하면 불필요한 작업을 방지하고 성능을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>여기서 마지막의 cancel 부분이 궁금하여 상세 코드를 좀 더 살펴보았는데, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">collect {}</code> 처리 후 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">apply</code> 부분에서 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">cancel()</code>과 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">join()</code>을 처리하고 있음을 알 수 있는데, 항상 최신의 값만을 흘려보냄을 코드로 알 수 있다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin

Flow 활용 - link\nCallback으로 전달받은 데이터를 Coroutines의 Channel로 처리해보자. - link\n이 글에서는\n2025 안드로이드 탐구 영역에 나온 문제 일부를 정리한다.\nCoroutiens flow에 대한 이해가 필요하다.\n문제를 살펴보자\n아래가 문제에서 나온 전체 코드이다.(Test 부분은 수정)\n\n@Test\nfun test() = runTest {\n    val stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(1)\n\n    val flow = flow {\n        emit(1)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(2)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(3)\n    }\n        .flatMapLatest { value ->\n            stateFlow\n                .map {\n                    value + it\n                }\n        }\n\n    launch {\n        delay(999L)\n        stateFlow.emit(2)\n        delay(999L)\n        stateFlow.emit(3)\n    }\n\n    flow\n        .collect { value -> println(\"value: $value\") }\n}\n\n\n이 문제에서는 1 개의 StateFlow와 1 개의 flow {}를 초기화하고, flow 다음에 flatMapLatest를 사용하여 StateFlow를 통해 새로운 흐름을 만드는 문제이다.\n\nflatMapLatest는 무엇인가?\nflatMapLatest - link의 함수 원형은 아래와 같다.\n\n@ExperimentalCoroutinesApi\npublic inline fun <T, R> Flow<T>.flatMapLatest(@BuilderInference crossinline transform: suspend (value: T) -> Flow<R>): Flow<R> =\n    transformLatest { emitAll(transform(it)) }\n\n\n문서의 설명 그대로를 가져오면\nReturns a flow that switches to a new flow produced by transform function every time the original flow emits a value. When the original flow emits a new value, the previous flow produced by transform block is cancelled.\n제미나이에게 해석을 요청한 부분은 다음과 같다.\n이 코드는 원본 flow가 값을 내보낼 때마다 transform 함수에 의해 생성된 새로운 flow로 전환하는 flow를 반환합니다.\n좀 더 자세히 설명하면,\nflow는 코루틴에서 비동기적으로 데이터를 처리하는 데 사용되는 자료 구조입니다. 마치 시간에 따라 값을 내보내는 스트림과 같습니다.\ntransform은 flow의 각 값을 변환하는 함수입니다. 이 함수는 새로운 flow를 생성할 수도 있습니다.\nflatMapLatest는 flow의 각 값에 대해 transform 함수를 호출하여 새로운 flow를 생성하고, 이 flow들의 값을 순차적으로 내보내는 연산자입니다.\n중요한 점은, 원본 flow가 새로운 값을 내보낼 때마다 이전에 transform 함수에 의해 생성된 flow는 취소된다는 것입니다. 즉, 항상 최신 값에 대한 flow만 활성화됩니다.\n예를 들어, 사용자가 검색어를 입력할 때마다 검색 결과를 가져오는 flow가 있다고 가정해 보겠습니다. flatMapLatest를 사용하면 사용자가 새로운 검색어를 입력할 때마다 이전 검색 결과에 대한 flow는 취소되고 새로운 검색어에 대한 flow가 생성됩니다.\n이러한 방식은 최신 값만 처리해야 하는 경우에 유용합니다. 예를 들어, 사용자 인터페이스에서 최신 데이터만 표시해야 하는 경우 flatMapLatest를 사용하면 불필요한 작업을 방지하고 성능을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.\n여기서 마지막의 cancel 부분이 궁금하여 상세 코드를 좀 더 살펴보았는데, collect {} 처리 후 apply 부분에서 cancel()과 join()을 처리하고 있음을 알 수 있는데, 항상 최신의 값만을 흘려보냄을 코드로 알 수 있다.\n\ninternal class ChannelFlowTransformLatest<T, R>(\n    private val transform: suspend FlowCollector<R>.(value: T) -> Unit,\n    flow: Flow<T>,\n    context: CoroutineContext = EmptyCoroutineContext,\n    capacity: Int = Channel.BUFFERED,\n    onBufferOverflow: BufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.SUSPEND\n) : ChannelFlowOperator<T, R>(flow, context, capacity, onBufferOverflow) {\n    override fun create(context: CoroutineContext, capacity: Int, onBufferOverflow: BufferOverflow): ChannelFlow<R> =\n        ChannelFlowTransformLatest(transform, flow, context, capacity, onBufferOverflow)\n\n    override suspend fun flowCollect(collector: FlowCollector<R>) {\n        assert { collector is SendingCollector } // So cancellation behaviour is not leaking into the downstream\n        coroutineScope {\n            var previousFlow: Job? = null\n            flow.collect { value ->\n                previousFlow?.apply { // 이 부분\n                    cancel(ChildCancelledException())\n                    join()\n                }\n                // Do not pay for dispatch here, it's never necessary\n                previousFlow = launch(start = CoroutineStart.UNDISPATCHED) {\n                    collector.transform(value)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n결국 flatMapLatest를 사용하면 2 개의 flow 흐름을 합칠 수 있으며, 이전 흐름의 데이터는 언제나 최신 데이터 흐름을 사용함을 알 수 있다.\n\n돌아가서\nMutableStateFlow는 가장 마지막 최신 데이터 1 개를 사용할 수 있는 상태를 저장하기 위한 용도이며, HotFlow이다. 언제나 최신 데이터만을 가진다.\n반대로 flow는 구독하기 전에는 동작하지 않는 ColdFlow에 속한다.\nKotlin Coroutines Flow의 Cold/Hot flow(Stream)의 데이터 흐름(Data flow) 이해해 보기 - link\n\nval stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(1)\n\nval flow = flow {\n    emit(1)\n    delay(1_000L)\n    emit(2)\n    delay(1_000L)\n    emit(3)\n}\n    .flatMapLatest { value ->\n        stateFlow\n            .map {\n                value + it\n            }\n    }\n\n\n그럼 이 코드에서의 구독 시점은 이어서 나오는 코드에서 알 수 있는데, launch {}를 실행하고 나서 바로 collect를 하고 있음을 알 수 있다.\n\nlaunch {\n    delay(999L)\n    stateFlow.emit(2)\n    delay(999L)\n    stateFlow.emit(3)\n}\n\nflow\n    .collect { value -> println(\"value: $value\") }\n\n\n\n구독한 데이터의 순서\n이 문제는 테스트가 가능하고, 이해할 수 있는 형태로 제공해야 해서 delay를 명확하게 제공해 주고 있다.\n구독이 시작되면 emit(1)을 시작하고, 1초의 대기가 걸린다. 그럼 StateFlow의 1과 emit 1을 합산하여 2 출력, 이어서 999ms 후에 stateFlow에 2를 전달하였으므로 1+2의 결과 3을 출력한다.\n이후의 결과를 통합하면 2, 3, 4, 5, 6이 순차로 출력된다.\n\n이 문제의 답은\n사실 위 코드를 해석할 필요도 없는 간단한 문제이다.\nStateFlow에 emit(2)를 하면 flow {} emit(1)부터 다시 발행되어진다. 라는 부분이다.\nflatMapLatest에 걸어둔 StateFlow에 값을 넘기더라도 flow {}  부터 실행한다는 건 일어날 수 없다. 하지만 exception이 발생하고, retry를 걸었다면 flow {}부터 실행할 수 있다.\nretry 위치가 매우 중요한데, 이전에 작성한 글의 최하단 시나리오 2 번 부분을 살펴보길\nKotlin Coroutines Flow의 Cold/Hot flow(Stream)의 데이터 흐름(Data flow) 이해해 보기 - link\n\nStateFlow가 아니라 SharedFlow를 함께 사용하면?\n문제를 조금 바꿔 StateFlow 대신 SharedFlow를 사용한다면 코드의 동작은 어떻게 될까?\n\n@Test\nfun test() = runTest {\n    val sharedFlow = MutableSharedFlow<Int>()\n\n    val flow = flow {\n        emit(1)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(2)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(3)\n    }\n        .flatMapLatest { value ->\n            sharedFlow\n                .map {\n                    value + it\n                }\n        }\n\n    launch {\n        delay(999L)\n        sharedFlow.emit(2)\n        delay(999L)\n        sharedFlow.emit(3)\n    }\n\n    flow\n        .collect { value -> println(\"value: $value\") }\n}\n\n\n이 코드의 응답은 확연하게 달라지는데 3, 5 만이 출력된다.\nSharedFlow는 replay를 하지 않기 때문에 값이 오기 전에는 반응 자체를 하지 않기 때문이다.\n그래서 이 코드는\nemit(1)을 하더라도 println하지 않고 sharedFlow에 2가 들어와야 만 1+2하여 3이 출력된다.\n\nStateFlow, SharedFlow, flow를 셋 다 합성한다면?\nmerge, combine, zip을 활용하는 것이 아니라 MutableStateFlow를 하나 더 추가하고 flatMapLatest를 하나 더 추가하여 활용하는 경우를 아래와 같이 추가해 보았다.\n\n@Test\nfun test() = runTest {\n    val sharedFlow = MutableSharedFlow<Int>()\n    val stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(false)\n\n    val flow = flow {\n        emit(1)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(2)\n        delay(1_000L)\n        emit(3)\n    }\n        .flatMapLatest { value ->\n            sharedFlow\n                .map {\n                    value + it\n                }\n        }\n        .flatMapLatest { // 여기에 추가\n            stateFlow\n                .filter { it }\n        }\n\n    launch {\n        delay(999L)\n        sharedFlow.emit(2)\n        delay(999L)\n        sharedFlow.emit(3)\n        stateFlow.value = true // 여기에 추가\n    }\n\n    flow\n        .collect { value -> println(\"value: $value\") }\n}\n\n\n이 코드는 앞에 코드보다 더 쉽게 딱 한 번의 값만이 출력되는데, 이 값은 true이다.\n왜 true인지는 flatMapLatest를 이해한다면 매우 쉽게 알 수 있다.\n\n마무리\n이전에 작성한 글 보다 flow가 더 쉽게 느껴질 수 있다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "💬\n우아콘2024 PM멘토링 세션의 Q&A를 바탕으로 내용을 보완하여 작성한 글입니다. 질문/답변은 녹화되지 않았지만, 본 세션의 영상은 이전 포스팅을 참고해주세요. \n\n연차가 올라갈수록 PM이 만나야 되는 유관 부서가 많아집니다. 처음에는 기획 디자인 개발 이렇게 만났지만, 점점 다른 업체도 만나고, 봐야 되는 업무 범위가 많이 넓어져요. 그러다 보니까 회사에서 하루 종일 사람들 만나고 회의하고 회의록 정리하고 나면은 제가 일할 시간이 거의 없어지는 걸 많이 느끼거든요.\n그래서 이제 점점 버려야 될 거나 이제 덜어내야 될 거가 뭔지를 좀 생각해 봐야겠다는 생각이 드는데, 멘토님은 이제 점점 이 업무가 많아질 때 가장 먼저 뭘 덜어내는 게 필요하다고 생각하시는지 궁금합니다.\n\n\n회사가 기대하는 리더, 그리고 ‘무엇을 덜어낼 수 있을까?’\n우선, 회사마다 ‘리더나 매니저’에게 기대하는 모습이 천차만별이더라고요. 어떤 곳은 “임팩트 조금 덜해도 되니까 일단 빨리 진행해야 한다”가 핵심 가치인 반면, 또 어떤 곳은 “중요한 건 심도 있게 논의하고, 제대로 된 결과물을 내야 한다”라고 말하거든요.\n그러니까 회사(또는 상위 결정권자)가 어떤 의사결정 스타일을 지향하는지에 따라, 내가 취해야 할 스케줄링 방식이 달라질 수밖에 없다는 겁니다. 예를 들어, ‘빨리빨리’를 강조하는 회사라면, 제 경험상 회의나 일을 덜어내기란 쉽지 않습니다. 대신 회의를 빠르게 끝내거나, 빠르게 의사결정을 내려야만 하죠. 반면 심도 있는 논의를 선호하는 회사에서는, 한 번의 회의만으로 끝낼 수 없는 주제들이 많아지니 또 다른 식의 스케줄 관리가 필요한 거예요.\n어쨌든, 회사의 문화가 어떻든 간에 “무언가를 덜어낼 수 있느냐”는 결국 내 업무 범위와 역할을 명확히 아는 것에서 시작됩니다. 내가 ‘어떤 파트에 기여할 수 있고, 어떤 파트는 과감히 남에게 넘길 수 있는지’를 스스로 구분해야, 비로소 회의나 잡무를 줄일 수 있으니까요.\n1. 비즈니스팀에서 ‘빠른 의사결정’이 중요했을 때\n제가 한창 ‘비즈니스팀’에서 일할 때에는, 빠른 의사결정이 정말 중요했습니다. 과제의 목표와 일정이 분명하니까, 회의가 곧 실행이고 실행이 곧 결과였어요. 그래서 하루 종일 회의실에서 여러 팀과 의견 맞추다 보면, 정작 제 일을 할 시간은 없었죠.\n한 번은 “이렇게 회의를 몰아서 다 하는 게 맞나?” 싶어서 일부 미팅을 팀원들에게 넘겨봤는데, 그 결과 의사결정을 못 내린 회의들이 도로 저에게 돌아오더라고요. ‘아, 결국 결론이나 방향성 제시는 내 몫이었구나’ 하고 깨닫게 됐죠. 그래서 그 뒤로는 ‘의사결정이 필요한 단계인가, 아닌가’를 분명히 갈라서, 결정이 필요한 타이밍이라면 제가 직접 들어가고, 아직 목표나 일정이 확실치 않은 상황이라면 팀원들에게 먼저 탐색하게 했습니다.\n2. 지원팀에서 '명확한 역할분배'가 중요했을 때\n지금은 ‘공통서비스기획팀’이라는 곳에서 일고 있는데, 이 부서는 이름부터 ‘공통’이라서인지, 영역이 명확하지 않다는 특성이 있더라고요. 누가 뭘 담당해야 하는지 애매하다 보니, 팀원들에게 회의를 위임해놓으면 결국엔 일이 다시 제게 돌아오는 경우가 많았어요. 그래서 이제는 R&R이 확실하게 정리될 때까진 제가 회의에 참여하고, 이후부터는 팀원들에게 전권을 주는 식으로 바꾸었습니다.\n예전에는 “아, 중요한 회의니까 내가 일단 다 들어가야지”라고만 생각했다면, 이제는 “어떤 회의에 내가 꼭 참여해야 하고, 어떤 회의는 다른 분들이 잘 진행할 수 있을까?”를 먼저 판단합니다. 결과적으로, 의사결정이 필요하거나 R&R이 불확실한 미팅에는 제가 들어가지만, 어느 정도 가이드만 있어도 충분히 돌아갈 만한 회의는 팀원들이 주도하도록 넘기는 편이죠.\n믿고 맡긴다고 하더라도 “아, 그래도 내가 회의를 빠지면 뭔가 놓치는 게 아닐까?” 하고 불안하실 수 있어요. 저도 그랬어요. 팀원들이 대신할 수 있는 부분이 있어도, 놓칠까 봐 전부 챙기려다 보니 결국 제 본업에 쓸 시간이 너무 부족해지더라고요.\n그런데 막상 해보면, ‘의사결정이 필요한 회의 vs. 그렇지 않은 회의’를 구분하고 적절히 넘기는 게 훨씬 효율적입니다. 디자인 회의에서 이미 UI/UX 방향이 확정된 상태라면, 저는 PM이 빠져도 괜찮다고 생각해요. 컨셉과 정책이 이미 정해졌다면, 디자이너와 개발자가 세부를 더 자유롭게 논의해도 됩니다. 물론 큰 변수가 생길 것 같으면 다시 제가 회의에 들어가서 방향을 잡아주긴 하지만요.\n\n'위임'과 '거절' 사이엔 많은 옵션이 있어요. \n사실 “그거 팀 리더니까 가능한 거 아니야?”라고 많이들 여쭤보세요. 근데 저는 리더가 아니어도 할 수 있는 일이 많다고 봅니다. 예를 들어, 기획 단계에서의 정책 결정에는 꼭 참여해야 하겠지만, 이후 디자인·개발 단계로 넘어가면 실제 작업자들이 더 많이 알고 있을 수 있잖아요. 그렇다면 굳이 내가 모든 회의에 다 들어가서 가이드할 필요는 없는 거죠.\n스스로 “내 역할에서 무엇을, 어떤 속도감으로, 어디까지 책임질 건지”를 정해두면, 자연스럽게 어떤 회의에 들어가고 어떤 회의는 넘길지 기준이 잡히거든요. 단순히 회의가 많으니 ‘아무 회의나 막 덜어내자’가 아니라, ‘지금 이 단계에서 내가 반드시 결정해야 할 게 있는가?’를 면밀히 살펴보는 게 포인트예요.\n즉, 나의 역할에서 무엇을, 어떤 속도감으로, 원하는 결정을 할 것인가에 따라서 스케쥴링 전략을 다르게 가져가야 합니다. 단순이 회의가 많다는 현상은 제대로 된 문제정의가 아니에요. \n하지만 막상 현실에선 “거절해도 되나?” 하는 마음이 들 수 있죠. ‘내가 빠지면 민폐 아닐까?’ ‘결국 일이 또 내게 돌아오진 않을까?’ 이런 불안감도 있고, 회의를 거절하는 게 왠지 미안하게 느껴지기도 하고요. 그런데 생각보다 회의를 거절하는 건 훨씬 다양한 방법이 있습니다. '안갈거임'과 '나는 아님', '아직 아님'만 구분해도 훨씬 마음이 편해집니다. \n\n자신보다 의사결정력이 높은 분에게 위임\n서면회의록만 공유받고 중요한 부분만 확인\n목적이 불분명하면 주제 세팅을 다시 요청\n\n이런 식으로 스마트하게 거절하거나 재조정해보세요. 제 시간과 에너지는 한정되어 있으니까요. 그리고 무작정 거절을 표하기보다는 어떻게 해야 회의가 더 나아질 수 있는지 “이 회의는 목표가 불분명하니 한 번 더 정리된 다음에 만나요” 식으로 의견을 내면 오히려 상대도 시간을 아낄 수 있습니다. 이렇게 작은 태도 변화만으로도, “회의로 하루 종일 바빴다”는 피로감을 크게 줄일 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n\n이번 회의의 결과에 기대를 낮춰보세요\n“그런데 그렇게 해도 회의가 줄어들지 않는다”는 분들도 있을 겁니다. 저도 그럴 때가 있어요. 어떤 이슈들은 한 번 만에 해결되지 않고, 2~3번쯤은 모여야 진전이 생기는 경우가 흔하니까요. 그래서 “도대체 언제 한 방에 결론이 나지?” 하고 짜증이 날 때가 있죠.\n이럴 땐 회의의 목적을 아주 작게나마 설정해두는 것이 도움이 됩니다. 예를 들어, “이 회의에서는 내가 무엇만 얻어가면 되겠다”라는 식으로 스스로 목적을 작게나마 설정해두는 거죠. 이렇게 목적 자체를 다양화해두면, “이 시간 자체가 헛되지 않았다”는 느낌을 조금 더 쉽게 가질 수 있습니다. \n또한, 이 시간을 나에게 어떻게 유리하게 쓸 수 있을지 고민해보시면 좋겠습니다. 아무리 불필요해 보이는 회의라 해도, 그 안에서 내가 놓치면 안 되는 정보나 사람들의 생각 흐름 등을 파악할 기회가 될 수 있거든요. 이렇게 의도적으로 에너지를 분배하면, 회의가 덜 비효율적으로 느껴집니다.\n조금 더 구체적으로 말씀드리면, 하나의 아젠다가 한 번에 해결되는 경우는 드물다고 생각하시고, “이 이슈는 약 3번 정도 회의를 하게 되겠다” 하고 미리 예상해보는 겁니다. 그리고 첫 번째 회의에서는 “서로 어떤 어려움이 있고, 어떤 맥락에서 고민하는지” 정도만 이해해오겠다고 내 회의 목적을 세팅해두는 거죠.\n그러면 회의 중간에라도 어느 정도 목적 달성이 이뤄졌다 싶을 때,\n“지금 회의 시간이 얼마 남지 않아서 결론까지 도출하기는 어려울 것 같습니다. 그래도 서로의 상황은 어느 정도 이해한 것 같으니, 다음 회의 전까지 각자 3~4개 정도 방안을 검토해오면 어떨까요?”\n라고 제안하면서 회의를 일찍 마무리할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 다음 번 회의가 훨씬 더 명확해지고, 실제로 문제 해결 가능성이 높아집니다.\n\n결국, 회의가 많아지면 “어떻게 덜어낼 수 있을까?”라는 고민은 모두가 하게 됩니다. 그렇지만 정답은 “회의를 다 없애자”가 아니라, ‘내가 꼭 챙겨야 하는 회의와 그렇지 않은 회의를 구분’하고, “이 회의에서 무엇만 얻어가면 되는지” 목적을 명확히 하는 데 있습니다.\n특히 연차가 올라갈수록 일은 늘고, 유관부서도 많아지죠. 그래서 제 경험상, 의사결정이 필요한 단계에는 직접 뛰어들되, 아직 목표나 일정이 불투명하거나 실행만 하면 되는 단계는 팀원·동료에게 과감히 넘기는 게 답이었습니다. 그렇게 해야 비로소 제가 해야 할 ‘진짜 일’에 시간을 쏟을 수 있었으니까요.\n여러분에게 정말 '중요한 일'은 무엇인가요? 혹시 '중요해 보이는 일에 뛰어다니는 일'은 아니었을까요? 이번주 캘린더를 돌아보고 중요하지 않은 일 하나를 거절해보세요. 처음은 힘드니까요. '해서는 안될 일은 아니니까 해도 괜찮다'고 스스로에게 말해주세요.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "지난 주말에 영화 ‘머니볼’을 다시 봤다. 탄핵 관련 의견과 시각이 궁금해서 여러 가지 뉴스 채널을 왔다 갔다 하다가 우연히 영화 채널을 지나쳤는데, 마침 이 오래된 클래식을 상영하고 있고, 시작한 지 10분도 안 돼서, 오랜만에 이 영화를 다시 봤다. 책도 그렇고, 영화도 그렇고, 인생의 모든 게 그렇듯이, 아는 만큼만 보인다는 게 이 영화에도 그대로 적용됐다. 이미 그 원작이 꽤 유명한 책이라서 영화가 만들어질 때부터 많은 관심이 집중됐고, 2011년에 영화가 개봉되자마자 나도 봤는데, 그때도 너무 재미있게 봤다.\n그런데 13년 후 이 영화를 다시 봤을 땐, 이전엔 나에게 없었던 인생과 사업의 경험이 어느 정도 축적돼 있었다. 영화의 모든 장면, 그리고 등장인물들의 대사와 행동을 이런 개인적인 경험, 지식과 계속 비교하면서 봤는데, 이것도 너무 즐거운 경험이었다. 머니볼을 2011년도에 봤을 때도 명작이라고 생각했지만, 두 번째 시청했을 땐 인생을 잘 살아갈 수 있는 좋은 철학, 자세와 태도가 담긴 정말 훌륭한 작품이라는 감탄을 하면서 단톡방에서 친구들에게 이 영화에 대한 예찬을 하기도 했다.\n특히 내가 가장 인상 깊었던 건 주인공 빌리 빈의 남에 대한 생각이었다. 한국이나 미국이나 대부분의 리더와 조직원들은 남에게 인정받기 위해서 직장 생활을 하고 있고, 얼마 전에 읽었던 기사는 좋은 리더의 대표적인 인재상이 바로 남한테 인정받는 사람이라는 내용으로 가득 차 있었다. 남한테 인정받는 직원이 좋은 직원이고, 남한테 인정받는 리더가 좋은 리더라는 고정관념이 우리 모두의 머릿속에 너무나 강하게 박혀있는데, 빌리 빈의 모든 대사와 행동은 이 고정관념과 반대로 설정되어 있었다. 그는 그 누구에게도 인정받지 않는 방법을 사용해서 야구의 새로운 역사를 쓴다. 남에게 인정받기 위한 구단주를 지향했다면 이렇게 하지 않았을 것이다. 그는 스스로 살고, 오클랜드 A’s가 살기 위해서 스스로 믿는 길을 택했고, 남이 인정하지 않는 결정을 계속했다.\n나도 요새 이런 생각을 꽤 많이 하고 있다. 둘이 시작했던 스트롱벤처스가 이제 나를 포함해서 8명의 조직으로 성장했고, 이제 나는 좋든 싫든 7명의 동료이자 팀원들의 리더가 됐다. 리더십이라는 말을 우린 너무나 남발하는데, 열 명에게 좋은 리더에 관해서 물어보면, 이 중 아홉은 아마도 남한테 인정받는 리더가 좋은 리더라고 말할 정도로 우리 사회는 리더에 대한 강한 고정 관념을 갖고 있다.\n솔직히 나는 우리 동료들에게 인정받기 위해서 고민하진 않는다. 우리 동료들에게 인정받기 위해 결정을 하지도 않는다. 스트롱이 계속 살아남을 수 있게, 그리고 외부 환경이 변하고 모든 것이 바뀌어도 우리가 시대에 뒤처지지 않고 중요한 존재로 남을 수 있기 위한 결정을 하기 위해서 고민한다. 이런 결정을 계속하다 보면, 남이 나를 인정할 때도 있고, 인정하지 않을 때도 있는데, 별로 상관하지 않는다. 나는 남한테 인정받는 사람이 되는 덴 별로 관심이 없다. 오히려 나 스스로에게 인정받는 사람이 되는데 관심이 많다. 리더로서는, 내가 리더로서 한 결정들로 인해서 우리 조직이 계속 번창했으면 좋겠다. 이거 하나밖에 없다.\n우리도 이건 모두 한 번씩 고민해 봤으면 좋겠다. 특히, 한국같이 남에게 인정받아야지만 인간 구실을 할 수 있는 사회에서는. 과연, 남한테 인정받는 리더가 좋은 리더인지, 남한테 인정받는 직장 동료가 좋은 동료인지, 남한테 인정받는 사람이 좋은 사람인지. 남한테 인정받는 사람보단, 오히려 스스로에게 인정받는 사람이 더 좋은 사람이 아닌진.",

Rockefeller)가 설립한 회사인데요. 19세기 말에 스탠더드 오일은 미국 석유 시장의 약 90%를 장악하며 독점적인 지위를 구축했습니다. 이를 위해 경쟁사들의 계약을 방해하거나, 가격 덤핑 전략을 사용하여 소규모 석유 회사들을 하나씩 퇴출시켜 버렸고요.\n이렇게 시장을 지배하며 더 이상 경쟁을 할 필요가 없게 되자, 스탠더드 오일은 가격을 인위적으로 인상했습니다. 소비자들은 울며 겨자 먹기로 높은 연료비를 부담해야 했죠.\n이와 같이 시장이 소수의 기업에 의해 지배되면 가격은 더 이상 자유롭게 조정되지 않고, 자원의 배분도 왜곡됩니다.\nG: 소비자 입장에서는 동일한 재화에 대해 서로 다른 가격을 가진 여러 개의 제품이 있어야 더 나은 선택을 할 수 있는 기회를 가질 수 있는 것인데, 이렇게 되면 아무 비교도 없이 하나의 기업이 제공하는 재화만 하나의 가격에 구입해야 하니… 시장 독점이 위험한 이유겠네요.\nK: 그렇습니다. 지난 시간에 “부자는 반드시 사회에 환원해야 할까?” 아티클에서 살펴본 것처럼, 국방 서비스와 같은 공공재는 누군가 소비하더라도 다른 사람이 동일한 재화를 소비하는 데에 제한이 없습니다. \n또한 대가를 지불하지 않은 사람도 자유롭게 사용할 수 있죠. 이렇게 공공재는 경합성과 배제성이 낮기 때문에, 시장에 맡겨두면 공급이 제대로 이루어지지 않을 것입니다.\n이와 같이 외부효과, 시장지배력, 공공재의 공급 제한 등과 같은 상황에서는 보이지 않는 손이 제 역할을 하지 못하게 돼요. 결국 정부의 개입이 필요하게 됩니다.\nG: 정부가 개입하면 어떤 일들이 일어나나요?\nK: 대표적으로 ‘세금’이 있겠죠. 정부는 오염 물질을 배출하는 기업에게 세금을 부과할 수 있고, 오염 물질을 상대적으로 덜 배출하는 재생 에너지를 사용할 경우 보조금을 지급하는 방식 등을 통해 외부효과를 완화할 수 있습니다.\n또한 정부는 ‘공정거래법’ 등을 통해 기업의 독과점을 규제하여 시장에서 경쟁이 제대로 이루어지도록  유도할 수 있습니다. 앞서 살펴본 스탠더드 오일의 경우 ‘셔먼법(Sherman Act)’이라 불리는 반독점법에 따라 34개의 기업으로 분할하라는 판결을 미국 연방대법원이 내리게 됩니다.\n최근 구글이 인터넷 검색시장에서 독점적인 시장지배력을 남용하여 경쟁을 저해했다는 이유로 미국 법무부가 구글에 대한 기업 분할 조치를 검토하고 있는 것도 비슷한 맥락으로 이해할 수 있습니다.\n\n정부의 시장 개입에 대한 경제학자들의 생각들\nG: 앞서 설명주신 상황 외에도 정부의 개입이 필요한 상황이 있을까요?\nK: 경제가 대규모의 침체기에 빠졌을 때도 정부의 개입이 필요합니다. 1920년대 후반에 대공황(The Great Depression)이 발생했을 당시만 해도, 경제학자들은 가격 메커니즘을 신봉했습니다.\n대규모 경제 침체가 일어나면, 사람들은 일자리를 잃고 소비도 줄겠죠. 물건이 팔리지 않아 재고가 계속 쌓이게 되면 가격은 점점 떨어지게 되고요. 이렇게 가격이 계속 떨어지게 되면 어느 시점에는 다시 수요가 증가하게 될 것이고, 경제는 결국 스스로 제 자리를 찾아가게 될 것이라는 것이 이들의 논리였어요.\nG: 실제로는 어떠했나요?\nK: 예상과 다르게 흘러갔어요. 미국의 실업률이 지속적으로 치솟아 25%까지 오르고, 국민 소득은 반 토막이 났거든요. 보이지 않는 손은 침묵을 지키게 됩니다.\n이때 경제학계에 한 줄기 빛이 내려오는데요. 바로 존 메이너드 케인스(John Maynard Keynes) 입니다.\n케인스는 불황이 발생하는 원인에 대해 이렇게 말했어요. 시장의 수요가 충분하지 않았기 때문이며, 정부가 직접 나서서 돈을 지출하거나 세금을 삭감함으로써 경기 침체에서 벗어날 수 있을 것이라고요.\n실제로 케인스는 미국의 루즈벨트 대통령에게 편지를 보냅니다. 정부가 지출을 늘리게 되면 시간이 지나면서 그 효과가 눈덩이처럼 불어나고, 전체 경제에 영향을 주게 되는 승수효과(multiplier effect)를 근거로 미국이 대규모 공공부문 지출 프로그램을 시행할 것을 촉구하기도 했어요.\nG: 정부의 적극적 개입이 필요하다 강조한 거군요.\nK: 맞습니다. 케인스는 보이지 않는 손에게 모든 것을 맡기는 시장의 자율성에 의문을 제기하며, 정부의 적극적 개입이 필요함을 강조한 대표적인 경제학자라고 할 수 있습니다.\n그러나, 케인스의 이론에 모든 경제학자들이 동의한 것은 아닙니다.\n특히 시카고대학교의 밀턴 프리드먼(Milton Friedman)은 “과도한 정부 개입은 오히려 경제적 비효율성을 초래하고 개인의 자유를 침해할 수 있다”고 주장했어요. 또한 그는 “경제의 안정을 위해서는 케인스가 주장한 정부의 재정 정책보다는 통화 정책이 더 효과적”이라고 말했습니다.\nG: \"과도한 정부 개입이 비효율을 초래한다\"는 프리드먼의 주장에 대해 조금 더 자세히 설명해 주실 수 있을까요?\nK: 물론입니다. 프리드먼은 시장이 스스로 균형을 찾아가는 메커니즘을 신뢰했어요. 정부가 지나치게 개입하면 자원의 효율적인 배분이 왜곡될 것을 걱정했습니다. 정부가 대규모 재정 정책으로 소비를 촉진하려 할 때, 자금이 오히려 비효율적인 부문으로 흐를 수 있다는 우려도 있었어요. 이 과정에서 개인의 선택과 자유가 침해당할 가능성도 있다고 본 거죠.\n당시 정부의 과도한 개입으로 인해 물가는 상승하고 경제는 침체되었는데, 프리드먼은 이를 방지하려면 통화 정책이 더 적합하다고 봤습니다.\nG: 그렇군요. 그래서 그는 정부가 직접 돈을 쓰는 방향보다, 통화량을 조절하는 방식으로 시장의 흐름을 ‘간접적으로’ 조정해야 한다 주장했군요.\nK: 맞습니다. 케인스의 이론을 따르는 경제학자들과 프리드먼의 이론을 따르는 경제학자들은 1950년대부터 1970년대까지 설전을 이어갔는데요.\n프리드먼은 만약 정부가 인플레이션을 방치한 채 더 많은 일자리를 창출하는 데에만 정책 목표를 둔다면, 결국에는 물가 상승만을 초래하고 기존의 일자리를 파괴하게 될 것이라고 주장했습니다.\n그의 주장은 특히 1970년대에 발생한 경기침체와 인플레이션이 합쳐진 ‘스태그플레이션’ 시기에 주목받았어요. 프리드먼의 주장이 사실로 증명되었거든요. 이때부터 이른바 ‘통화주의’가 힘을 얻게 됩니다.\n한편, 굳이 정부가 개입하지 않아도 시장의 실패를 극복할 수 있다는 새로운 시각도 등장했는데요. 바로 로널드 코즈(Ronald Coase)가 제시한 ‘코즈의 정리(Coase Theorem)’입니다.\n코즈에 따르면 “외부효과와 같은 시장 실패가 발생하는 상황에서도, 소유권이 명확히 정의되어 있고, 정보의 수집과 협상에 들어가는 비용 등과 같은 거래 비용(transaction cost)이 낮다면, 시장 참여자 간의 협상을 통해 자원이 얼마든지 효율적으로 배분될 수 있다”고 주장합니다.\nG: 코즈는 프리드먼과 다른 의견이었군요. 시장에 문제가 생기는 경우, 누구에게 어떤 권리가 있는지 명확하고 사람들이 서로 대화하거나 합의하는 데에 드는 비용이 크지 않다면, 정부가 개입하지 않아도 된다는 말일까요?\nK: 맞습니다. 이는 정부의 개입 없이도 가격 메커니즘이 작동할 수 있는 가능성을 열어줍니다. 정부가 개입하지 않아도 사람들이 스스로 문제를 해결하고 자원을 효율적으로 나눌 수 있다는 뜻이죠.\n예를 들어, 공장이 오염 물질을 배출해서 주변에 거주하는 주민들에게 피해를 주었을 때, 피해 주민과 공장 소유자가 협상을 통해 오염 물질을 줄이도록 서로 합의한다면, 굳이 정부가 중간에 개입하지 않더라도 문제를 해결할 수 있다고 본 것입니다.\n\n오늘은 “시장은 정말 보이지 않는 손에 의해 움직이는가?”에 대해 살펴보았는데요. 보이지 않는 손은 가격 메커니즘을 통해 시장이 자율적으로 작동할 수 있음을 보여줍니다.\n그러나 현실 경제에서는 외부효과, 독과점, 공공재 공급 제한 등으로 인해 보이지 않는 손이 제대로 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다. 이렇게 시장이 스스로 자원을 효율적으로 배분하지 못하는 상황에서는 정부의 적절한 개입이 필요하고요.\n다만, 시장이 항상 완벽하지 않은 것처럼 정부도 완벽하지 않습니다. 시장과 정부는 대립하는 관계이기 보다는 서로의 불완전한 부분을 보완해주는 관계에 가깝습니다.\n앞으로 경제 뉴스를 보실 때는 시장의 ‘보이지 않는 손’과 정부의 ‘보이는 손’이 어떻게 서로 협력하는지를 유심히 관찰해보면 좋을 것 같네요.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

(주로 12월쯤 나타나요)\n날씨가 평소와 다르게 바뀌어요. 북미·남미에는 폭우와 홍수가, 아시아·호주에는 가뭄과 폭염이 발생하기도 해요. \n우리나라 기준으로 보면 겨울철 기온이 올라가고, 겨울에 비가 내리는 날이 늘어나요.\n\n2. 라니냐\n\n엘니뇨와 반대로, 태평양 바닷물 온도가 평소보다 낮아지는 현상이에요.\n무역풍이 평소보다 더 강하게 불면, 따뜻한 바닷물이 서태평양(아시아)으로 빠르게 밀려갑니다.\n그러면 동태평양에서는 이 빈자리를 채우기 위해 심해의 차가운 바닷물이 수면 위로 올라오게 되죠. 이 때문에 동태평양 해수 온도가 낮아지고, 라니냐가 발생합니다. (주로 엘니뇨가 끝난 뒤 나타나는 경우가 많고, 여름에 시작해서 겨울에 가장 강해져요) \n날씨도 엘니뇨와 반대로 나타나요. 북미·남미 날씨는 건조해지고, 북미에는 강추위가 찾아오기도 하고요. 아시아·호주에는 폭우와 홍수가 발생할 수 있어요. \n우리나라 기준으로 보면  여름 무더위가 심해지고 폭염이 더 길어져요. 태풍이 자주 발생하고 한반도로 북상할 가능성도 커집니다. 겨울에는 한파가 더 자주 발생하고, 눈이 많이 내릴 수 있습니다.\n\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}\"커피 한 잔 합시다\" 이 말도 이젠 부담?…원두 가격 계속 오를까\n(머니투데이 2024.11.26.)\n5일 인베스팅닷컴에 따르면 영국 런던국제금융선물거래소(LIFFE)에서 거래되는 로부스타 원두 선물 가격은 지난 22일 기준으로 전일 대비 4.14% 오른 4985달러에 마감했다. 최근 일 년간 로부스타 원두 선물 가격은 89%대 뛰었다. 지난해 9월에는 역대 최고가를 기록하기도 했다.\n커피 강세의 배경에는 엘니뇨가 있다. 엘니뇨는 열대 동태평양 표층 수온이 평년보다 높아지는 현상이다. 무역풍 약화가 원인으로 꼽히지만 정확한 원인은 알려지지 않았다. 엘니뇨가 발생하면 미국 남부와 멕시코 지역은 강우량이 높아지고, 미 북부와 캐나다, 아시아 등에는 가뭄이 찾아온다.\n이 때문에 엘니뇨는 커피를 비롯한 연성 원자재(소프트 커머디티)의 가격을 올려놓는 주범으로 꼽힌다. 올해도 엘니뇨는 세계 최대 커피 산지인 브라질과 로부스타 원두의 주요 산지인 베트남, 인도네시아 등에 가뭄을 불러왔다. 커피 원두 생산량이 줄어들자 가격도 지난해 말부터 강세를 보였다.\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}기후 변화가 심화되는 만큼 커피 가격의 변동성이 커질 것이라는 관측이 나온다. 피치 솔루션의 찰스 하트 애널리스트는 외신과의 인터뷰에서 \"향후 10년 동안 기후 변화로 커피 부문에 구조적인 리스크가 더욱 심화될 것\"이라며 \"전 세계의 커피 생산량이 영향을 받으면서 가격 변동성도 커질 것\"이라고 봤다.\n다만 단기적으로 커피 가격의 강세는 이어지지 않을 전망이다. 엘니뇨가 끝나고 라니냐가 찾아오며 커피, 코코아 등 연성 원자재의 가격이 하락할 수 있어서다. 정한솔 대신증권 연구원은 \"소프트 가격 강세를 야기했던 엘니뇨가 종료되면서 원당/커피/코코아 등 소프트 가격이 내년 하락 전환할 것\"이라고 분석했다.\n대신 라니냐가 찾아오면서 소프트 대신 곡물가가 강세를 보일 것이라는 예상이다. 라니냐는 전 세계에 옥수수와 대두를 공급하는 핵심 생산지인 북미에서 강추위를, 남미에서는 가뭄을 유발한다. 이에 따라 소프트 가격은 하락하지만 옥수수, 대두, 소맥 등 곡물 가격이 올라갈 가능성이 있다. (후략)\n\n\n올해 엘니뇨는 주요 커피 산지인 브라질, 베트남, 인도네시아에 심각한 가뭄을 불러왔고, 커피 원두 생산량도 감소했습니다.\n브라질은 세계 커피 시장의 약 40%를 차지하는 주요 커피 산지로, 가뭄으로 인한 수확량 감소는 세계 시장에 큰 파장을 미칠 수밖에 없어요. 베트남, 인도네시아는 로부스타 커피를 주로 생산하는 국가로, 가뭄이 길어질수록 원두 가격이 급등할 가능성이 크겠죠. 이렇게 작황이 좋지 않으니 공급량이 줄어들고, 커피 가격이 폭등할 수밖에 없는 경제적 결과를 불러옵니다.\n한편 엘니뇨가 끝나고 라니냐가 찾아오면, 북미에 강추위를 가져오면서 옥수수와 대두 생산에 차질이 생길 수 있습니다.\n특히 미국은 전 세계 옥수수와 대두의 주요 수출국이기 때문에, 생산량 감소가 세계 곡물 시장에 큰 영향을 미칠 수 있어요. 남미에는 가뭄을 가져오는데, 이로 인해 브라질과 아르헨티나 같은 곡물 생산국에 큰 피해를 주어 소맥(밀) 등 작물의 공급을 위협합니다. 엘니뇨가 커피에 미친 영향과 마찬가지로, 라니냐는 옥수수, 대두, 소맥 등 곡물 가격 상승을 유발할 것으로 보이고요.\n\n기후 변화가 심각해지면서 엘니뇨와 라니냐의 발생 빈도와 강도가 더 커질 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 특정 농산물의 생산량 변동성이 커지고 가격도 급등락을 반복하게 될 가능성이 높고요.\n이렇게 주요 식량의 가격이 급격하게 오르내리는 것이 우리 삶에 어떤 변화를 주는지 좀더 자세히 살펴볼까요? 커피를 예시로 들어볼게요.\n많은 사람들의 기호 식품인 커피 가격이 오른다는 것은, 단순히 커피를 좋아하는 소비자들에게만 영향을 주는 것이 아닙니다. 커피 시장에 다양한 변화를 불러올 수 있어요. 대형 커피 체인은 원가 상승 압박으로 제품 가격 인상을 고려할 수밖에 없고, 소규모 커피숍이나 자영업자들은 원가 부담이 더 크게 다가오기 때문에 소비자가 빠르게 이탈하며 폐업까지 이어지는 케이스가 많아질 수 있습니다. 또한 커피 가격이 오르면, 초콜릿(코코아)이나 설탕(원당) 등 다른 연성 원자재 가격에까지 영향을 미칠 수 있어요.\n이렇게 음료 전반의 가격이 지속적으로 오르면, 소비자들은 소비 습관을 바꾸려 할 거예요. 집에서 직접 커피를 만들어 마시는 빈도가 높아지겠죠. 홈카페 트렌드가 더욱 강화될 수 있습니다. 커피 대신 차(tea), 에너지 음료, 건강 음료 등 대체재를 찾는 수요도 증가할 수 있어요. 프리미엄 고급 커피에서 상대적으로 저렴한 커피 원두로 바꾸는 경향성도 보일거고요.\n더 나아가 정부와 산업에도 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 커피 같은 주요 작물의 공급 불안정이 계속되면, 대응책을 세우기 위해 기후 변화에 강한 품종 개발, 스마트 농업 기술 도입 등 혁신을 일으킬 수 있어요. 그리고 커피 수출국은 국내 수급 안정을 위해 수출 규제, 재고 비축을 강화할 수 있습니다. 반면 수입하는 국가들은 공급망 리스크를 줄이려 하겠죠.\n이렇게 엘니뇨·라니냐 같은 기후변화 현상은 개인은 물론 사회 전체에도 큰 영향력을 끼칩니다. 단순히 커피와 곡물의 문제를 넘어, 지구 전체의 식량 안보를 위협하고 있기에 관심을 기울여야 합니다.\n\n\n로부스타 원두: 세계적으로 널리 소비되는 커피 원두 중 하나. 카페인이 아라비카 원두보다 약 2배 많아, 커피의 강도와 쓴맛을 선호하는 사람들에게 인기 있어요. 아라비카 원두와 함께 커피 시장을 양분하는 커피 종류예요.\n연성 원자재: 주로 재배하거나 생산해야 하는 상품으로, 농산물·식품·목재 등 자연에서 얻어지는 원자재. 금·석유 같은 광물이나 에너지 원자재와 구분하여 쓰는 말이에요.\n농산물 선물 거래: 농산물을 미래 일정 시점에 정해진 가격으로 거래하기로 계약하는 금융 상품. 농민, 유통업자, 투자자 등 다양한 참여자들이 가격 변동 리스크를 줄이거나 이익을 추구하기 위해 활용해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
