        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Microsoft C++ team attended CppCon, the largest C++ conference in the world. This year, the conference was held in Aurora, Colorado from September 16-20.\nMicrosoft Booth\nOur team managed a booth from Monday to Thursday of the week. This gave us an amazing opportunity to interact with the C++ community and discuss many topics of interest as well as hear feedback from our customers.\n\nThe following people worked at the booth (from left to right in the picture above):\nVictor Ciura, who works on Rust and C++ interop. He presented a talk called So You Think You Can Hash.\nMryam Girmay, who works on Visual Studio productivity features. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nSinem Akinci, who works on CMake tooling in the Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code. Sinem also works on GitHub Copilot. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nAugustin Popa (me), and I work on the vcpkg package manager. My talk was called 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them.\nAlexandra Kemper, who works on the C++ experience in Visual Studio Code. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nMichael Price, who works on C++ integration with developer services like GitHub and Microsoft Dev Box. He was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nMicrosoft works on several developer tools for C++, including the Visual Studio IDE, Visual Studio Code, the MSVC compiler toolset, GitHub Copilot for C++, and the vcpkg package manager. We interacted with hundreds of C++ developers across a variety of different industries, experience levels, and familiarity with our product offerings. There were folks who had been using our products before their names started with “Visual”, and some that had never used our tools at all.\nWe were excited to see so much interest from developers for C++ best practices and how to become more productive. We received some great feedback about how we could improve our tools, in terms of bug reports, user experience improvements, and feature requests. We were also able to have several 1 on 1 longer discussions away from the booth to help people solve more specific challenges using Microsoft C++ developer tools.\n\nAt the booth we also gave out some cool swag, including USB adapters, vcpkg bags, stickers, and the ever-popular Visual Studio socks.\nWe also held a raffle at the end of each day at our booth, for some Visual Studio backpacks and tote bags.\n\n\n\nKeynote Talk: Peering forward – C++’s next decade\nAs usual, Herb Sutter delivered an excellent talk at CppCon. This year it was a keynote that looks forward in time, describing the planned evolution of the C++ language. The main topics were reflection, safety, and simplicity. These topics were effectively previews for a number of other C++ talks that elaborated on these topics in great detail.\n\n\nMicrosoft Talks at CppCon 2024\nAside from Herb’s keynote, there were several other talks delivered by folks from Microsoft at CppCon this year.\nSo You Think You Can Hash\nVictor delivered a talk on fundamentals of data structure design, focusing on computing hashes for aggregated user-defined types and experimenting with various hash algorithms. He introduced a method for experimenting with and benchmarking different hash algorithms. This allows easy switching of hashing algorithms used by complex data structures, enabling easy comparisons. This way, hash algorithm designers can concentrate on designing better hash algorithms, with little worry about how these new algorithms can be incorporated into existing code. Type designers can create their hash support just once, without worrying about what hashing algorithm should be used.\n\nThe talk spurred a bunch of hallway conversations on tradeoffs between performance and flexibility of type design, with attendees sharing their project pains and workarounds in this space.\n10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them\nI presented a talk on 10 problems that large companies have with C++ dependency management, based on many conversations I had this year with enterprise teams. I also went over how these companies are solving these problems. About half of the problems are solvable with a modern package manager, but the rest require additional investments in development workflows. The talk was well attended and there were some good conversations afterward about the problems.\n\nToday, developers are still more likely to manually manage their dependencies than to use a package manager and consider managing libraries a top pain point for C++, according to ISO C++ surveys. I pointed out some ways that a package manager like vcpkg can mitigate the pain. Here are a few examples:\nSupporting build from source as a fallback without sacrificing the build-time savings of binary dependency acquisition.\nUpgrading dependencies as a set using baselines, rather than managing them individually, to avoid version conflicts / diamond problems.\nHow to continue working in an offline build environment using asset caching.\nGetting any open-source libraries installed and working with your project with minimal effort, while also automatically resolving transitive dependencies.\nIn the second half of the talk, I noted that security is top of mind for enterprises, so vulnerability monitoring, detection, and response is critical. Some enterprises have also started using Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to track their dependencies and manage risk. I also pointed out that vcpkg generates SPDX SBOM files for dependencies.\nLastly, I spoke about some workflow changes that make it more manageable to do C++ development at scale, at a large company with many distributed teams. This includes centralizing common development tasks with dedicated core teams, moving to container-based builds and a standardized global build toolchain, and how to handle a large migration to a new software system by breaking it down into smaller, manageable milestones where you get a win at each step.\n\nAfter my talk, I talked with several folks about the problems they were dealing with at their work and what they had in common with the themes of the talk. In my opinion, one of the best things about delivering a talk is the conversations that happen afterward, which lead to new ideas and approaches to improve our software.\nEmbracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security\nAmanda Rousseau delivered a compelling talk on thinking like an adversary with respect to C++ security. She walked through some attack scenarios, vulnerability trends, exploits that actually exist out in the wild, and general strategies for C++ development. For Microsoft, security is always top of mind, and it was interesting hearing from her experiences about how to address these growing concerns.\n\nWhat’s new for Visual Studio Code: Performance, GitHub Copilot, and CMake Enhancements\nThe annual Visual Studio Code talk, delivered this year by Alexandra Kemper and Sinem Akinci, was packed full of updates for C++ developers. Enhancing performance for C++ developers was a top priority for our team, and the talk announced several updates to make the C++ development process faster, including updates to project start-up time and time to colorization. The talk featured enhancements to C++ Copilot completions, sample AI-assisted workflows in C++ code, and new Copilot extensibility points available for developers to tailor the AI tool to their workflow. Demonstrating the chat extension API extensibility points to CppCon via a @CppCon chat participant piqued interest in the crowd. The docs to learn more about these APIs available can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat.\n\n\nThe demo code that was used can be found below. The first demo focused on C++, CMake, and Copilot functionality whereas the second demo focused on a CppCon chat participant for Copilot.\nsinemakinci1/Cpp-Copilot-VSC-Demo at alex-gui-2\nsinemakinci1/cppcon-chat-participant: Chat participant for CppCon\n\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers\nMryam Girmay and Michael Price presented the 10th annual session demonstrating new features for C++ developers in Visual Studio. Highlighted this year were features to make you a more productive C++ developer, from shrinking your build times with Build Insights and Include Diagnostics, to reducing the amount of time you spend crafting the perfect commit message for those changes you’ve accumulated throughout the day, by letting GitHub Copilot write a first draft for you.\n\nVisual Studio leverages the power of GitHub Copilot to reduce the burden of routine tasks like sketching out unit tests for a function you just wrote or wading through pages of template error messages to understand what you’ve done wrong. And in the talk, Michael and Mryam demonstrated the soon-to-be-generally available content exclusion feature that you can configure to prevent contents from specified files never get sent in a prompt to GitHub Copilot. They also showcased interactive demos, allowing developers to see firsthand how these new features can be leveraged in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nAfter the talk, developers shared valuable feedback on Visual Studio, the Microsoft C++ compiler, and GitHub Copilot. Attendees came with questions and offered several suggestions on how we can further improve our products for them. This input is crucial as the team continues to refine and enhance the tool to better meet the needs of C++ developers.\n\nSome Other Interesting Talks\nThere were many great talks this year. Below are a few that we enjoyed.\nCommon Package Specification (CPS) in practice: A full round trip implementation in Conan C++ package manager\nDiego Rodriguez-Losada Gonzalez of JFrog delivered a very interesting talk where he demoed integrated Common Package Specification (CPS) files with various build systems, including CMake, MSBuild, Autotools, and Meson. The Common Package Specification is a mechanism for describing the useful artifacts of a software package and is a collaborative effort between several software vendors, build system maintainers, library authors, and large companies to eventually standardize such a system across the industry.\nCreating a Sender/Receiver HTTP Server\nThis session was a live-coding demo with building an HTTP server from scratch and debugging problems using C++26 sender/receivers.\nPerformance engineering – Being friendly to your hardware\nExcellent crash course on hardware details, from DRAM inner-workings to CPUs and how to write software to avoid angering the machine.\nSender Patterns to Wrangle Concurrency in Embedded Devices\nSuperb introduction to bare-metal senders and receivers and very crisp explanations of the async examples.\nC++/Rust Interop: Using Bridges in Practice\nQuick tour of the Rust/C++ interop essentials and some of the friction points in hybrid-code projects.\nTheme: Reflection\nEvery CppCon, there tends to be a big focus on some major feature that is coming up in the language. For a long time, that used to be modules. Now that modules are successfully baked into many of our developer tools and are seeing some adoption, the biggest discussion topic has moved to reflection. Reflection is a significant feature improvement that many of us have looked forward to for years, and our patience is getting rewarded. Aside from Herb’s keynote, there were several talks, including Reflection based libraries to look forward to (by Saksham Sharma), Reflection is Not Contemplation (by Andrei Alexandrescu), and Implementing Reflection using the new C++20 Tooling Opportunity: Modules (by Maiko Steeman). Lastly, Daveed Vandevoorde’s Gazing Beyond Reflection for C++26 went into some excellent technical detail while giving a preview of what’s to come and is worth checking out.\nTheme: C++ Security\nWe have all seen the headlines from industry analysts and governments over the past few years citing concerns with code safety or security in C++. This is a big focus area for the C++ Committee as well as large companies that must worry about rising threats to their business. Some specialized talks included: Security Beyond Memory Safety – Using Modern C++ to Avoid Vulnerabilities by Design (by Max Hoffmann), Embracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security (by Amanda Rousseau), Building Safe and Reliable Surgical Robotics (by Milad Khaledyan), Modern C++ Error Handling (by Phil Nash), Mix Assertion, Logging, Unit Testing and Fuzzing: Build Safer Modern C++ Applications (by Xiaofan Sun), “Pick a random number… no, not that one!” – Tales of Real-World Exploits Based on Bad Randomness (by Max Hoffmann), and Compile-time Validation (by Alon Wolf).\nIn addition, LLVM’s Realtime Safety Revolution: Tools for Modern Mission Critical Systems (by Christopher Apple and David Trevelyan) introduced the new Realtime Sanitizer, which detects calls to malloc, pthread_mutex_lock, and other problematic functions in your realtime code at runtime!\nLastly, there was also an expert-led Safety and Security Panel to check out too.\nWomen’s Luncheon\nThe Women’s Networking Luncheon was a fun and resourceful event. Alexandra, Mryam, and Sinem from Microsoft’s team attended. Each table buzzed with interesting discussions: women in tech, inspirations to join the programming world, various work experiences, and ideas to inspire the next generation of women. With table rotations, attendees had the chance to talk to different people in the room. The relaxed atmosphere fostered connections among women from diverse companies and places who share an interest in C++ and programming.\nConclusion\nIt was great to meet many of you in person this year at CppCon. We enjoyed our time there and learned a lot from the C++ community and have taken back our learnings to our day-to-day work. If you didn’t get a chance to attend or missed out on some of the sessions, remember to check out all the CppCon talk on the conference’s YouTube channel as they get rolled out! We also made a playlist of past Microsoft CppCon sessions. We look forward to seeing you again next year.\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2024: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "pubDate": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 16:06:51 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Since the recent announcement of the Proxy 3 library, we have received much positive feedback, and there have been numerous inquiries regarding the library’s actual performance. Although the “Proxy” library is designed to be fast, fulfilling one of our six core missions, it is not immediately clear how fast “Proxy” can be across different platforms and scenarios.\nTo better understand the performance of the “Proxy” library, we designed 15 benchmarks, tested in four different environments, and automated them in our GitHub pipeline to generate benchmarking reports for every code change in the future. Everyone can download the reports and raw benchmarking data attached to each build. The rest of this article delves into the benchmarking details. The numbers shown below were generated from a recent CI build.\nIndirect Invocation\nBoth proxy objects and virtual functions can perform indirect invocations. However, since they have different semantics and memory layout, it should be interesting to see how they compare to each other.\nBecause make_proxy can effectively place a small object alongside metadata (similar to “small buffer optimization” in some other C++ libraries), the benchmarks are divided into two categories: invocation on small objects (4 bytes) and on large objects (48 bytes). By invoking 1,000,000 object of 100 different types, we got the first two rows of the report:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nIndirect invocation on small objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 261.7% faster\nproxy is about 44.6% faster\nproxy is about 71.6% faster\nproxy is about 4.0% faster\n\n\nIndirect invocation on large objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 186.1% faster\nproxy is about 15.5% faster\nproxy is about 17.0% faster\nproxy is about 10.5% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the report, proxy is faster in all four environments, especially on Windows Server. This result is expected because the implementation of proxy directly stores the metadata of the underlying object, making it more cache-friendly.\nLifetime Management\nIn many applications, lifetime management of various objects can become a performance hotspot compared to indirect invocations. We benchmarked this scenario by creating 600,000 small or large objects within a single std::vector (with reserved space).\nBesides proxy, there are three typical standard options for storing arbitrary types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::any. std::variant is not included because it is essentially a tagged union and can only provide storage for a known set of types (though useful in data context management).\nFor small objects, proxy and std::any usually won’t allocate additional storage. For large objects, proxy and std::shared_ptr offer allocator support (via pro::allocate_proxy and std::allocate_shared) to improve performance, while there is no direct API to customize std::unique_ptr or std::any.\nHere are the types we used in the benchmarks:\nSmall types\nLarge types\n\n\n\n\nint\nstd::array<char, 100>\n\n\nstd::shared_ptr<int>\nstd::array<std::string, 3>\n\n\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex>\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex> + void*[15]\n\n\n\nBy comparing proxy with other solutions, we got the following numbers:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 467.0% faster\nproxy is about 413.0% faster\nproxy is about 430.1% faster\nproxy is about 341.1% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (without memory pool)\nproxy is about 639.2% faster\nproxy is about 509.3% faster\nproxy is about 492.5% faster\nproxy is about 484.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (with memory pool)\nproxy is about 198.4% faster\nproxy is about 696.1% faster\nproxy is about 660.0% faster\nproxy is about 188.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::any\nproxy is about 55.3% faster\nproxy is about 311.0% faster\nproxy is about 323.0% faster\nproxy is about 18.3% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 17.4% faster\nproxy is about 14.8% faster\nproxy is about 29.7% faster\nproxy is about 6.3% slower\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 283.6% faster\nproxy is about 109.6% faster\nproxy is about 204.6% faster\nproxy is about 88.6% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both without memory pool)\nproxy is about 29.2% faster\nproxy is about 6.4% faster\nproxy is about 6.5% faster\nproxy is about 4.8% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both with memory pool)\nproxy is about 10.8% faster\nproxy is about 9.9% faster\nproxy is about 8.3% faster\nproxy is about 53.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 13.4% faster\nproxy is about 1.3% slower\nproxy is about 0.9% faster\nproxy is about 9.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 270.7% faster\nproxy is about 80.1% faster\nproxy is about 136.9% faster\nproxy is about 120.4% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the benchmarking results:\nproxy is much faster than any other 3 when the underlying object is small, or managed with memory pools.\nproxy is slightly slower than std::unique_ptr when the underlying object is large and not managed with a memory pool.\nThe performance of std::any varies in different environments, but is generally slower than proxy.\nSummary\nAlthough the test environments (GitHub-hosted runners) may differ from actual production environments, the test results show significant performance advantages of proxy in both indirect invocations and lifetime management. If you have more ideas for benchmarking the “Proxy” library, we welcome contributions to our GitHub repository.\nThe post Analyzing the Performance of the “Proxy” Library appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "On October 20, the original author of the Fernflower Java decompiler, Stiver, passed away after a long fight against glioblastoma. \nStiver was a German programmer of Russian origin, primarily developing software for medical equipment. Twenty years ago, he developed a deep professional interest in Java virtual machine internals. You may remember his research blog posts, like this one (in Russian) from 2006 about how to tweak the Java class hierarchy using Unsafe when Java 1.5 was just released. Around 2008, Stiver became fascinated by Java decompilation.\nThe Java decompilation landscape was very poor at that time. The first generation of decompilers like JAD or JODE came to an end. While Java as a language evolved, the existing decompilers were mainly unmaintained, which limited their usefulness. New language constructs like assertion statements, annotations, and generic types were not supported. Moreover, the deprecation of JSR/RET instructions in Java bytecode caused a significant difference in how try-finally blocks are compiled. The decompilers failed to handle the new bytecode.\nAnother big problem with existing decompilers was their approach to decompilation. They simply looked for specific bytecode patterns and translated them to the corresponding Java statements and expressions. While simple, this approach is fragile – any minor semantically equivalent change in generated bytecode made proper decompilation impossible. This severely limited the decompiler application.\nStiver decided to write his own decompiler as a side project. To overcome the weaknesses of existing alternatives, he took a different approach. After reading the bytecode, he constructed a control-flow graph in static single-assignment form, which is much better to express the program semantics abstracting the particular shape of bytecode. At the beginning of this project, Stiver knew little about static analysis and compiler design and had to learn a lot, but the effort was worth it. The resulting decompiler produced much better results than anything available at that time. It could even decompile the bytecode produced by some obfuscators without any explicit support.\nStiver did the main development himself between 2008 and 2010. The first public version became available in May 2009 as a web service. A user could upload an individual CLASS file or a whole JAR file and get the decompiled result. The decompiler quickly gained popularity – during the first four months, users decompiled more than half a million Java classes. There was no public standalone version, but Stiver sent it privately to a few Beta testers. After the release, Stiver made numerous improvements and fixed many bugs thanks to early adopters.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 2010, the active development of the decompiler stopped, as Stiver became busier with his primary job. A few third-party software vendors asked Stiver to provide the decompiler for their projects. Notably, it was used with permission in Mod Coder Pack, which is a toolkit for creating mods for the game Minecraft. Still, it became difficult for a regular Java user to find a working version of Fernflower.\nIn 2013, JetBrains approached Stiver with a suggestion to include Fernflower in IntelliJ IDEA. Part of the deal was making Fernflower open source. Everything went well, and the contract was signed. On July 11, 2014, the early access version of IntelliJ IDEA 14 was released, including the decompiler for the first time. You can still see the initial import of the Fernflower source code in the IntelliJ IDEA Git history, on March 4, 2014.\nWhile Stiver was never a JetBrains employee, he helped improve the decompiler for almost a year after the initial import. As Java 8 had just been released, it was necessary to support new language constructs like lambdas. Another big challenge was integrating the decompiler with the IntelliJ IDEA debugger. Line numbers in decompiled code differ from line numbers in the original source, and Stiver helped provide a transparent mapping between them so you can seamlessly debug decompiled code.\n\n\n\n\nAs Fernflower became open source, many other tools in the Java world used it – you can find a number of forks on GitHub. The Java team at JetBrains is constantly improving Fernflower, but it’s still mainly Stiver’s code. If Fernflower hadn’t existed, we likely would have had to invest substantial resources into developing our own decompiler. This could have resulted in IntelliJ IDEA lacking a decompiler or having one that was significantly less effective. Stiver’s work was a real game-changer for Java developers over the past 10 years. With no better alternative to decompile Java bytecode, his contributions have saved developers countless hours while debugging Java code without sources. \nThank you, Stiver! We are deeply saddened by the loss of such a brilliant pioneer whose work and dedication had such a lasting and profound impact.",

Check out the latest PHP Core Roundup #19.\n        Secondly, The PHP Foundation has joined The Open Source Pledge which aims to encourage companies using open-source software to donate back to projects and help build a sustainable ecosystem. As part of this initiative, three PHP companies even made it onto the Nasdaq billboard.\n        Thirdly, commissioned by the German government-backed Sovereign Tech Fund, the foundation delivered the Web Services Tool for PHP-FPM.\n        And last but not least, The PHP Foundation is calling for sponsors. Sponsor the foundation and help shape the future of PHP!\n    \nPHP Core\n📣 RFC: Support Closures in constant expressions\n        This one has some interesting use-cases:\nfinal class Locale\n{\n    #[Validator\\Custom(static function (string $languageCode): bool {\n        return \\preg_match('/^[a-z][a-z]$/', $languageCode);\n    })]\n    public string $languageCode;\n}\n📊 RFC: Add persistent curl share handles\n        Eric Norris proposes to add a new function curl_share_init_persistent(), which would allow cURL handles to be stored in global memory and reused in subsequent requests. This enhancement aims to improve performance by reducing the overhead of initializing cURL handles each time. \n        Quoting Matthieu Napoli, the author of Bref, here:\n\n        Most PHP apps spend most of their time doing IO (not using the CPU). … But calling APIs (via HTTP) can take a very long time. Very different orders of magnitude.\n        Why? Because it establishes a TPC and HTTPS connection every time. That can take 100ms or 200ms (HTTPS is bonkers). On *every* request, because PHP (with FPM) recreates a connection every time. \n        That’s why switching to Laravel Octane or Symfony Runtime makes such a difference sometimes: by keeping the PHP process alive between requests, we can save these 100ms. Comparing that to what we save on the framework boot time, this is massive. \n        The RFC proposes to share HTTP connections between requests in PHP-FPM: that’s huge because it could bring some of these gains to all PHP apps out there, without having to switch to Octane/Runtime (and the downsides that come with it).\n        \n\n        And to further prove the point, here are a couple of real-world use cases and workarounds:\nWikipedia team: Impact of using HTTP connection pooling for PHP applications at scale.\nBedrock team: Increase performance and stability by adding an Egress Controller in a Kubernetes cluster at AWS.\n📣 RFC: Change behaviour of array sort functions to return a copy of the sorted array\n        Currently, PHP’s array sort functions take the array to sort by reference, modifying the original array in place. However, these functions always return `true` which often makes them not so convenient to use. \n        Gina Banyard proposes changing the return value of these functions sort(), rsort(), asort(), arsort(), ksort(), krsort(), natsort(), natcasesort(), usort(), uasort(), uksort(), array_multisort(), shuffle(), array_walk(), array_walk_recursive() from true to a copy of the array. \n        This change would allow for a more functional programming style, enabling to chain these functions and work with immutable data more easily.\n    \n✅ RFC: Change Directory class to behave like an opaque object\n    \n📣 RFC: Warn on conversions from resource to string\n    \nTools\nComposer 2.8.0\n--patch-only flag: This allows you to limit updates to patch-level changes, minimizing the risk of introducing breaking changes.\nAbility to explicitly decide if additional arguments/options should be passed to the underlying command.\nimliam/cpx – It’s like `npx` but for PHP. This tool allows you to run any command from any Composer package, even if it’s not installed in your project.\nphp.new – A one-line PHP installer from Laravel and Herd teams.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In IntelliJ IDEA, you can leverage AI Assistant’s capabilities within Database Tools for more efficient data querying and handling. It can significantly speed up SQL query generation, explain code, suggest fixes, and even create tables and populate them with test data on your command! Let’s get started!\nGet IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate\nTo enable the AI Assistant plugin, navigate to View | Tool Windows | AI Assistant or Settings | Plugins | Marketplace | AI Assistant.\nIn-editor AI actions\nGenerate SQL code in the editor\nAI Assistant can generate SQL code right in the query console, which is accessible via the Database Tools window.\n\n\n\n\nSimply click on the AI Assistant icon or invoke it using ⌘\\ (macOS) or Ctrl+\\ (Windows/Linux), write your request in the input field, and watch AI Assistant transform your words into precise SQL code.\n\n\n\n\nModify existing SQL code\nYou can also alter existing SQL queries by following the same steps. Just select a block of code, call the AI Assistant’s input field, and type in the changes or additions you would like to make to your current query.\n\n\n\n\nTest data tables\nAI Assistant can create tables and populate them with sample data right in the editor. Click the AI Assistant icon to open the Generate Code with AI dialog and ask AI Assistant to, for example, “Add queries that will create a books table and populate it with three sample rows”.\n\n\n\n\nAfter AI Assistant generates the code, you can preview and apply the result.\n\n\n\n\nCloud completion\nAI-powered cloud completion autocompletes code in real time based on the context of your SQL query. You don’t need to perform any extra actions to invoke cloud completion in a console, as it’s enabled by default – just keep on querying!\n\n\n\n\nChat with AI\nIn the chat, you can ask AI Assistant any database or query-related question, get it to perform actions, and so much more!\nTip: Use /explain or /refactor with #thisFile for quick and precise responses in the current context.\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare the DDL of two tables\nIn the chat, you can also tell AI Assistant to compare the DDL of two tables to get a detailed response highlighting the differences between the tables’ structures. In our example, we use the following prompt: “compare the DDL of actor and film_actor tables”.\n\n\n\n\nAI Assistant will generate a detailed comparison analyzing primary keys, columns, indexes, foreign keys, default values, and constraints. It will even give you a summary:\n\n\n\n\nOptimize the query’s performance using Explain Plan\nExplain Plan is crucial for maintaining robust, scalable database applications by providing insights into how queries are executed. AI Assistant can help identify issues with a query and optimize its overall performance.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, run Explain Plan for a query. Right-click an SQL statement and select Explain Plan | Explain Plan (Raw) from the context menu. Then, copy and paste the results into a chat with a request for analysis and optimization. The initial cost in our example is 93.22..134.83.\n\n\n\n\nAI Assistant will suggest an optimized query code, which you can insert into the console right away by clicking on Insert Snippet at Caret.\n\n\n\n\nYou can now run the Explain Plan command once again and check the cost. Our example now shows the lower cost of 52.80..94.62.\n\n\n\n\nAI prompts\nTo invoke a list of AI prompts, right-click an SQL statement or press ⌥↩ (macOS) or Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux), select AI Actions from the context menu, and choose an action you’d like to perform.\n\n\n\n\nExplain a query\nIt’s pretty straightforward: Explain Code gives you context-aware explanations within your database environment.\n\n\n\n\nRefactor SQL code\nSelect Suggest Refactoring from the context menu, and AI Assistant will provide a refactored piece of code alongside an explanation of why these changes would work better.\n\n\n\n\nYou can check both versions side by side by clicking on Show Diff or selecting Apply Immediately to accept the changes right away.\n\n\n\n\nFind problems and suggest a fix\nAI Assistant can find and fix problems with SQL queries. Select Find Problems from the AI actions list and AI Assistant will provide an explanation in the chat.\n\n\n\n\nYou can then ask AI Assistant to fix the code right in the chat.\nAdd your own prompts\nYou can add custom prompts and use them via the AI Actions menu. You can set this up by going to Settings | Tools | AI Assistant | Prompt Library and clicking +.\n\n\n\n\nModify tables\nAI Assistant can help you modify tables. Call the Modify dialog by right-clicking on the table in the Database Tools window and selecting Modify Table. Click the AI Assistant icon and type in your request, for example: “Switch all the VARCHAR data types to CHAR”.\n\n\n\n\nOnce AI Assistant generates the requested code, you’ll be able to view it in the preview pane of the dialog and then accept the suggestion.\nAll these AI Assistant features can greatly enhance your productivity when working with Database Tools. \nPreviously we looked into the basics of Database Tools and how simple shortcuts can make querying data more efficient.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Maybe you’ve heard complicated-sounding phrases such as ‘“Students t-test”, “regression models”, “support vector machines”, and so on. You might think there’s so much you need to learn before you can explore and understand your data, but I am going to show you two tools to help you go faster. These are summary statistics and graphs.\nSummary statistics and graphs/plots are used by new and experienced data scientists alike, making them the perfect building blocks for exploring data.\nWe will be working with this dataset available from Kaggle if you’d like to follow along. I chose this dataset because it has several interesting properties, such as multiple continuous and categorical variables, missing data, and a variety of distributions and skews. I’ll explain each variable I work with and why I chose each one to show you the tools you can apply to your chosen data set.\nIn our previous blog posts, we looked at where to get data from and bring that data into PyCharm. You can look at steps 1 and 2 from our blog post entitled 7 ways to use Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm to create a new Jupyter notebook and import your data as a CSV file if you need a reminder. You can use the dataset I linked above or pick your own for this walkthrough.\nWe’re going to be using the pandas library in this blog post, so to ensure we’re all on the same page, your code should look something like the following block in a Jupyter notebook –  you’ll need to change the spreadsheet name and location to yours, though. Make sure you’ve imported matplotlib, too, as we will be using that library to explore our data.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib as plt\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../data/AmesHousing.csv')\ndf\nWhen you run that cell, PyCharm will show you your DataFrame, and we can get started.\n      \n        Try PyCharm Professional for free\n    \n\n\n\n\nSummary statistics\nWhen we looked at where to get data from, we discussed continuous and categorical variables. We can use Jupyter notebooks inside PyCharm to generate different summary statistics for these, and, as you might have already guessed, the summary statistics differ depending on whether the variables are continuous or categorical.\nContinuous variables summary statistics\nFirst, let’s see how we can view our summary statistics. Click on the small bar graph icon on the right-hand side of your DataFrame and select Compact:\n\n\n\n\nLet me give you a little tip here if you’re unsure which variables are continuous and which are categorical, PyCharm shows different summary statistics for each one. The ones with the mini graphs (blue in this screenshot) are continuous, and those without are categorical.\nThis data set has several continuous variables, such as Order, PID, MS SubClass, and more, but we will focus on Lot Frontage first. That is the amount of space at the front of the property.\nThe summary statistics already give us some clues:\n\n\n\n\nThere’s a lot of data here, so let’s break it down and explore it to understand it better. Immediately, we can see that we have missing data for this variable; that’s something we want to note, as it might mean we have some issues with the dataset, although we won’t go into that in this blog post!\nFirst, you can see the little histogram in blue in my screenshot, which tells us that we have a positive skew in our data because the data tails off to the right. We can further confirm this with the data because the mean is slightly larger than the median. That’s not entirely surprising, given we’d expect the majority of lot frontages to be of a similar size, but perhaps there are a small number of luxury properties with much bigger lot frontages that are skewing our data. Given this skew, we would be well advised not to use the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion because that is calculated by using all data points, so it’s affected by outliers, which we know we have on one side of our distribution.\nNext, we can calculate our interquartile range as the difference between our 25th percentile of 58.0 and our 75th percentile of 80.0, giving us an interquartile range of 22.0. Alongside the interquartile range, it’s helpful to consider the median, the middle value in our data, and unlike the mean, it is not based on every data point. The median is more appropriate for Lot Frontage than the mean because it’s not affected by the outliers we know we have.\nSince we’re talking about the median and interquartile range, it is worth saying that box plots are a great way to represent these values visually. We can ask JetBrains AI Assistant to create one for us with a prompt such as this:\nCreate code using matplotlib for a box plot for  ‘Lot Frontage’. Assume we have all necessary imports and the data exists.\nHere’s the code that was generated:\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.boxplot(df['Lot Frontage'].dropna(), vert=False)\nplt.title('Box Plot of Lot Frontage')\nplt.xlabel('Lot Frontage')\nplt.show()\nWhen I click Accept and run, we get our box plot:\n\n\n\n\nThe median is the line inside the box, which, as you can see, is slightly to the left, confirming the presence of the positive or right-hand skew. The box plot also makes it very easy to see a noticeable number of outliers to the right of the box, known as “the tail”. That’s the small number of likely luxury properties that we suspect we have.\nIt’s important to note that coupling the mean and standard deviation or the median and IQR gives you two pieces of information for that data: a central tendency and the variance. For determining the central tendency, the mean is more prone to being affected by outliers, so it is best when there is no skew in your data, whereas the median is more robust in that regard. Likewise, for the variation, the standard deviation can be affected by outliers in your data. In contrast, the interquartile range will always tell you the distribution of the middle 50% of your data. Your goals determine which measurements you want to use. \nCategorical variables summary statistics\nWhen it comes to categorical variables in your data, you can use the summary statistics in PyCharm to find patterns. At this point, we need to be clear that we’re talking about descriptive rather than inferential statistics. That means we can see patterns, but we don’t know if they are significant.\nSome examples of categorical data in this data set include MS Zoning, Lot Shape, and House Style. You can gain lots of insights just by looking through your data set. For example, looking at the categorical variable Neighborhood, the majority are stated as Other in the summary statistics with 75.8%. This tells you that there might well be a lot of categories in Neighborhood, which is something to bear in mind when we move on to graphs. \nAs another example, the categorical variable House Style states that about 50% of the houses are one-story, while 30% are two-story, leaving 20% that fall into some other category that you might want to explore in more detail. You can ask JetBrains AI for help here with a prompt like:\nWrite pandas code that tells me all the categories for ‘House Style’ in my DataFrame ‘df’, which already exists. Assume we have all the necessary imports and that the data exists.\nHere’s the resulting code:\nunique_house_styles = df['House Style'].unique()\n\n\nprint(\"Unique categories for 'House Style':\")\nprint(unique_house_styles)\nWhen we run that we can see that the remaining 20% is split between various codes that we might want to research more to understand what they mean:\nUnique categories for ‘House Style’:\n['1Story' '2Story' '1.5Fin' 'SFoyer' 'SLvl' '2.5Unf' '1.5Unf' '2.5Fin']\nHave a look through the data set at your categorical variables and see what insights you can gain!\nBefore we move on to graphs, I want to touch on one more piece of functionality inside PyCharm that you can use to access your summary statistics called Explain DataFrame. You can access it by clicking on the purple AI icon on the top-right of the DataFrame and then choosing AI Actions | Explain DataFrame.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains AI lists out your summary statistics but may also add some code snippets that are helpful for you to get your data journey started, such as how to drop missing values, filter rows based on a condition, select specific columns, as well as group and aggregate data. \nGraphs\nGraphs or plots are a way of quickly getting patterns to pop out at you that might not be obvious when you’re looking at the numbers in the summary statistics. We’re going to look at some of the plots you can get PyCharm to generate to help you explore your data.\nFirst, let’s revisit our continuous variable, Lot Frontage. We already learned that we have a positive or right-hand skew from the mini histogram in the summary statistics, but we want to know more! \nIn your DataFrame in PyCharm, click the Chart View icon on the left-hand side:\n\n\n\n\nNow click the cog on the right-hand side of the chart that says Show series settings and select the Histogram plot icon on the far right-hand side. Click x to clear the values in the X axis and Y axis and then select Lot Frontage with group and sort for the X axis and Lot Frontage with count for the Y axis:\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm generates the same histogram as you see in the summary settings, but we didn’t have to write a single line of code. We can also explore the histogram and mouse over data points to learn more. \nLet’s take it to the next level while we’re here. Perhaps we want to see if the condition of the property, as captured by the Overall Cond variable, predicts the sale price.\nChange your X axis SalePrice group and sort and your Y axis to SalePrice count and then add the group Overall Cond:\n\n\n\n\nLooking at this chart, we can hypothesize that the overall condition of the property is indeed a predictor of the sale price, as the distribution and skew are remarkably similar. One small note is that grouping histograms like this works best when you have a smaller number of categories. If you change Groups to Neighborhood, which we know has many more categories, it becomes much harder to view! \nMoving on, let’s stick with PyCharm’s plotting capabilities and explore bar graphs. These are a companion to frequency charts such as histograms, but can also be used for categorical data. Perhaps you are interested in Neighbourhood (a categorical variable) in relation to SalesPrice.\nClick the Bar [chart] icon on the left-hand side of your series setting, then select Neighbourhood as Categories and SalesPrice with the median as the Values:\n\n\n\n\nThis helps us understand the neighborhoods with the most expensive and cheapest housing. I chose the median for the SalesPrice as it’s less susceptible to outliers in the data. For example, I can see that housing in Mitchel is likely to be substantially cheaper than in NoRidge. \nLine plots are another useful plot for your toolkit. You can use these to demonstrate trends between continuous variables over a period of time. For example, select the Line [graph] icon and then choose Year Built as the X axis and SalePrice with the mean as the Y axis:\n\n\n\n\nThis suggests a small positive correlation between the year the house was built and the price of the house, especially after 1950. If you’re feeling adventurous, remove the mean from SalePrice and see how your graph changes when it has to plot every single price! \nThe last plot I’d like to draw your attention to is scatter plots. These are a great way to see a relationship between two continuous variables and any correlation between them. A correlation shows the strength of a relationship between two variables. To dig deeper, check out this beginner-friendly overview from Real Python.\nFor example, if we set our X axis to SalePrice and our Y axis to Gr LivArea, we can see that there is a positive correlation between the two variables, and we can also easily spot some outliers in our data, including a couple of houses with a lower sale price but a huge living area!\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nHere’s a reminder of what we’ve covered today. You can access your summary statistics in PyCharm either through Explain DataFrame with JetBrains AI or by clicking on the small graph icon on the right-hand side of a DataFrame called Column statistics and then selecting Compact. You can also use Detailed to get even more information than we’ve covered in this blog post. \nYou can get PyCharm to create graphs to explore your data and create hypotheses for further investigation. Some more commonly used ones are histograms, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots.\nFinally, you can use JetBrains AI Assistant to generate code with natural language prompts in the AI tool window.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring Boot is an application framework for the Java platform designed to make it easy to build Spring-powered applications. Its opinionated convention-over-configuration approach to building Spring applications improves developer productivity.\nIntelliJ IDEA provides extensive coding assistance for Spring, including a dedicated project wizard, code highlighting, intelligent context actions, embedded documentation, navigation, and highly customizable run configurations. For a detailed description of the supported features, refer to IntelliJ IDEA for Spring Developers.\nWe are going to build a REST API to manage bookmarks using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL database by implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints.\nIn this article, we are going to cover the following:\nCreate a Spring Boot project from IntelliJ IDEA\nRun a PostgreSQL database instance\nConnect to the database using IntelliJ IDEA’s database tools support\nDatabase setup using an SQL script\nGenerate entities from the database\nCreate a Spring Data JPA repository\nAdd custom finder methods to the repository\nUsing Spring Data JPA projection\nInvoke the repository methods using the JPA console\nImplement API endpoint handler methods\nTest API endpoints using the HTTP Client\nWhile building the CRUD REST API using Spring Boot, we are going to use various features offered by IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate. If you haven’t already installed it, please download and install IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA\nIf you are using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, you can manually create the classes using the code snippets in this article.\nCreate a Spring Boot project\nLet’s start with creating a new Spring Boot project. When you open the IntelliJ IDEA New Project wizard, you can see there is dedicated support for creating Spring Boot projects.\nSelect Java as the language and provide values for Group, Artifact, and Package name. We are going to use Gradle – Groovy as the build tool in this article, but you can choose other alternatives if you prefer. We are going to use Java 21 and Jar packaging.\n\n\n\n\nClick Next, select the following dependencies, and then click the Create button.\nSpring Web\nValidation\nSpring Data JPA\nPostgreSQL Driver\n\n\n\n\nNow, the project will be created and opened in the IDE.\nRun a PostgreSQL database instance\nWe need a PostgreSQL database instance for running our application. You can download and install the PostgreSQL database from https://www.postgresql.org/download/. If you have Docker installed, you can use Docker to run a PostgreSQL database container using the following command:\ndocker run -p 5432:5432 \\\n -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \\\n -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \\\n -e POSTGRES_DB=postgres \\\n postgres:17\nThe above command will pull the Docker image postgres:17 from Docker Hub, if not already pulled, start a Postgres container, and map container port 5432 to host port 5432. The username, password, and database values are passed using environment variables. You can check whether Postgres is running by running the docker ps command as follows:\n\n\n\n\nConnect to PostgreSQL using IntelliJ IDEA’s database tools support\nNow that the PostgreSQL database is running, let’s connect to it using IntelliJ IDEA’s database tools support and the following connection parameters:\nHost: localhost\nPort: 5432\nUsername: postgres\nPassword: postgres\nDatabase: postgres\nYou can open the Database tool window either by clicking on the database icon on the right-hand side toolbar or by going to View | Tool Windows | Database.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new data source of type PostgreSQL by providing the following information:\n\n\n\n\nYou can click on Test Connection to verify whether the database connection can be established successfully or not.\nDatabase setup using an SQL script\nSelect the PostgreSQL datasource from the Database tool window and open the query console. Now, let’s create a database table called bookmarks and then populate some sample data by running the following SQL script:\ncreate sequence bookmark_id_seq start with 1 increment by 50;\n\ncreate table bookmarks\n(\n    id         bigint       not null default nextval('bookmark_id_seq'),\n    title      varchar(200) not null,\n    url        varchar(500) not null,\n    created_at timestamp    not null default now(),\n    updated_at timestamp,\n    primary key (id)\n);\n\ninsert into bookmarks(title, url, created_at) values\n('IntelliJ IDEA documentation', 'https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html', '2021-06-26'),\n('IntelliJ IDEA YouTube channel', 'https://www.youtube.com/intellijidea', '2021-10-10'),\n('JetBrains Guide', 'https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/', '2023-12-05'),\n('Java Guide', 'https://www.jetbrains.com/guide/java/', '2024-08-15');\nNow, let’s configure the database connection properties in the src/main/resources/application.properties file as follows:\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/postgres\nspring.datasource.username=postgres\nspring.datasource.password=postgres\nWhen we start our Spring Boot application, a database connection pool will be created connecting to the configured Postgres database.\nGenerate entities from the database\nJPA (Jakarta Persistence API) is a standard Jakarta EE API for ORM (Object Relational Mapping) frameworks. JPA allows you to map the relational data model with an object model, providing an object-oriented way to work with databases.\nIntelliJ IDEA Ultimate provides support for working with JPA, code assistance, etc. From IntelliJ IDEA, we can generate JPA entities from an existing database schema.\nIntelliJ IDEA provides Reverse Engineering capabilities for generating JPA entities from an existing database out of the box. However, we will use the JPA Buddy plugin, which provides a lot more features that make working with JPA and Spring Data JPA much easier.\nGo to Settings | Plugins | Marketplace, search for “jpa buddy”, and install the JPA Buddy plugin.\nNow, you can generate JPA entities from a database by right-clicking on a Java package in the Project tool window and selecting New | JPA Entities from DB from the context menu.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you will have a Bookmark JPA entity generated as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport jakarta.persistence.*;\nimport jakarta.validation.constraints.NotNull;\nimport jakarta.validation.constraints.Size;\nimport org.hibernate.annotations.ColumnDefault;\nimport java.time.Instant;\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"bookmarks\")\npublic class Bookmark {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = \"bookmarks_id_gen\")\n    @SequenceGenerator(name = \"bookmarks_id_gen\", sequenceName = \"bookmark_id_seq\")\n    @Column(name = \"id\", nullable = false)\n    private Long id;\n\n    @Size(max = 200)\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = \"title\", nullable = false, length = 200)\n    private String title;\n\n    @Size(max = 500)\n    @NotNull\n    @Column(name = \"url\", nullable = false, length = 500)\n    private String url;\n\n    @NotNull\n    @ColumnDefault(\"now()\")\n    @Column(name = \"created_at\", nullable = false)\n    private Instant createdAt;\n\n    @Column(name = \"updated_at\")\n    private Instant updatedAt;\n\n    // setters & getters\n}\nCreate Spring Data JPA repository\nThe JPA Buddy plugin also makes it easy to create a Spring Data JPA repository for a JPA entity.\nRight-click on a Java package and then select New | Spring Data JPA Repository.\nSelect Bookmark as Entity and click OK.\n\n\n\n\nThe BookmarkRepository will be created as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\npublic interface BookmarkRepository extends JpaRepository<Bookmark, Long> {\n}\nTo get all the bookmarks in reverse chronological order of their creation, we can use the inherited findAll(Sort sort) method as follows:\nSort sort = Sort.by(Sort.Direction.DESC, \"createdAt\");\nList<Bookmark> bookmarks = bookmarkRepository.findAll(sort);\nAlternatively, we can also leverage Spring Data JPA’s derived query method feature and create the following method to achieve the same:\npublic interface BookmarkRepository extends JpaRepository<Bookmark, Long> {\n    List<Bookmark> findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc();\n}\nWith the findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc() method name, Spring Data JPA automatically prepares the SQL query that uses the order by created_at desc clause.\nWhile this works fine, it is not recommended to return JPA entities as HTTP API responses. Instead, we can return Spring Data JPA interface-based projections.\nAssuming we just want to return only the id, title, url, and createdAt fields of Bookmark, we can create a Spring Data JPA projection using the JPA Buddy plugin as follows:\nRight-click on Bookmark.java and select New | Other | Spring Data Projection.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can change the Projection class name if needed, select the desired fields, and then click OK.\nThe BookmarkInfo.java interface will be generated as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport java.time.Instant;\n\n/**\n * Projection for {@link Bookmark}\n */\npublic interface BookmarkInfo {\n    Long getId();\n\n    String getTitle();\n\n    String getUrl();\n\n    Instant getCreatedAt();\n}\nNow, let’s update the BookmarkRepository to return the projection as follows:\npublic interface BookmarkRepository extends JpaRepository<Bookmark, Long> {\n    List<BookmarkInfo> findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc();\n}\nLet’s also add a method to find a bookmark for the given id as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Optional;\n\npublic interface BookmarkRepository extends JpaRepository<Bookmark, Long> {\n    List<BookmarkInfo> findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc();\n\n    Optional<BookmarkInfo> findBookmarkById(Long id);\n}\nWe are returning Optional<BookmarkInfo> because a bookmark with the given id may or may not exist.\nIntelliJ IDEA provides the ability to invoke Spring Data JPA repository methods using the JPA console. So, we can call the repository methods and check whether they are returning the expected result or not.\nClick on the gutter icon to run the query in the JPA console:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Gradle, you’ll need to select a persistence unit from the ones available. Select the bookmarks.main Persistence Unit.\nNow, provide inputs to the method if required, and then you’ll see the results as follows:\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: In a typical three-layered architecture, there will be the Web, Service, and Persistence layers. In the Service layer, we usually implement business logic as a unit of work, which might involve multiple database operations, as a transactional operation. In our sample application, as we don’t have any complex business logic, the controller will directly talk to the repository.\nImplement Controller API handler methods\nLet’s implement the API endpoint handlers for performing CRUD operations.\nFirst, let’s create a BookmarkNotFoundException, which we will throw when the requested bookmark is not found.\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\npublic class BookmarkNotFoundException extends RuntimeException {\n    public BookmarkNotFoundException(String message) {\n        super(message);\n    }\n}\nNow, let’s create BookmarkController as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/api/bookmarks\")\nclass BookmarkController {\n    private final BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n\n    BookmarkController(BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository) {\n        this.bookmarkRepository = bookmarkRepository;\n    }\n\n    //CRUD API handler methods\n}\nTIP: With IntelliJ IDEA, you don’t need to manually define and inject the dependencies before using them. When you need to use another Spring bean, you can start typing the dependent bean name, and IntelliJ IDEA will show the matching beans. When you select a bean, IntelliJ IDEA will automatically define and autowire the dependent bean using a constructor.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s implement API handler methods to get all bookmarks (GET /api/bookmarks) and get bookmark by id( GET /api/bookmarks/{id}) as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/api/bookmarks\")\npublic class BookmarkController {\n    //...\n\n    @GetMapping\n    List<BookmarkInfo> getBookmarks() {\n        return bookmarkRepository.findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc();\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/{id}\")\n    ResponseEntity<BookmarkInfo> getBookmarkById(@PathVariable Long id) {\n        var bookmark = \n             bookmarkRepository.findBookmarkById(id)\n             .orElseThrow(()-> new BookmarkNotFoundException(\"Bookmark not found\"));\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(bookmark);\n    }\n}\nNOTE: For the GET /api/bookmarks API, we are returning all the bookmarks, but in a real-world application, we would recommend using pagination.\nNext, let’s implement the create bookmark (POST /api/bookmarks) handler method.\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport jakarta.validation.Valid;\nimport jakarta.validation.constraints.NotEmpty;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\nimport org.springframework.web.servlet.support.ServletUriComponentsBuilder;\n\nimport java.time.Instant;\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/api/bookmarks\")\npublic class BookmarkController {\n    //...\n    record CreateBookmarkPayload(\n            @NotEmpty(message = \"Title is required\")\n            String title,\n            @NotEmpty(message = \"Url is required\")\n            String url) {}\n\n    @PostMapping\n    ResponseEntity<Void> createBookmark(\n            @Valid @RequestBody CreateBookmarkPayload payload) {\n        var bookmark = new Bookmark();\n        bookmark.setTitle(payload.title());\n        bookmark.setUrl(payload.url());\n        bookmark.setCreatedAt(Instant.now());\n        var savedBookmark = bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark);\n        var url = ServletUriComponentsBuilder.fromCurrentRequest()\n                .path(\"/{id}\")\n                .build(savedBookmark.getId());\n        return ResponseEntity.created(url).build();\n    }\n}\nWe have created a local record CreateBookmarkPayload to represent the request payload and used the Jakarta Bean Validation API to validate the required fields. If the request payload is valid, then we create the Bookmark object and persist it in the database. Then, we construct the URL for the newly created bookmark and send it as the Location header. If the request payload is invalid, then by default, Spring Boot will handle this error by returning the HTTP status code 400 - BAD_REQUEST with the default error response.\nNext, let’s implement Update (PUT /api/bookmarks/{id}) and delete the bookmark (DELETE /api/bookmarks/{id}) handler methods.\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n//imports\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/api/bookmarks\")\npublic class BookmarkController {\n    //...\n    record UpdateBookmarkPayload(\n            @NotEmpty(message = \"Title is required\")\n            String title,\n            @NotEmpty(message = \"Url is required\")\n            String url) {\n    }\n\n    @PutMapping(\"/{id}\")\n    ResponseEntity<Void> updateBookmark(\n            @PathVariable Long id,\n            @Valid @RequestBody UpdateBookmarkPayload payload) {\n        var bookmark =\n              bookmarkRepository.findById(id)\n                .orElseThrow(()-> new BookmarkNotFoundException(\"Bookmark not found\"));\n        bookmark.setTitle(payload.title());\n        bookmark.setUrl(payload.url());\n        bookmark.setUpdatedAt(Instant.now());\n        bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark);\n        return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();\n    }\n\n    @DeleteMapping(\"/{id}\")\n    void deleteBookmark(@PathVariable Long id) {\n        var bookmark =\n             bookmarkRepository.findById(id)\n             .orElseThrow(()-> new BookmarkNotFoundException(\"Bookmark not found\"));\n        bookmarkRepository.delete(bookmark);\n    }\n}\nWe have created a local record UpdateBookmarkPayload to represent the update request payload and used the Jakarta Bean Validation API to validate the required fields. If the request payload is valid, then we try to load the Bookmark object from the database. If the bookmark doesn’t exist, the code will throw a BookmarkNotFoundException. Otherwise, we will update the bookmark data in the database.\nSimilarly, for the delete bookmark API endpoint, we try to delete the bookmark if it exists. Otherwise, a BookmarkNotFoundException is thrown.\nWhen we throw a BookmarkNotFoundException from our handler methods, by default, Spring is going to handle it and return a response with the HTTP status code 500 - INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR. But when the bookmark is not found, it makes sense to send the 404 - NOT_FOUND status code. So, let’s implement an ExceptionHandler as follows:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n//imports\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/api/bookmarks\")\npublic class BookmarkController {\n    //...\n    \n    @ExceptionHandler(BookmarkNotFoundException.class)\n    ResponseEntity<Void> handle(BookmarkNotFoundException e) {\n        return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();\n    }\n}\nNow, when any handler method in BookmarkController throws a BookmarkNotFoundException, it will be handled by the ExceptionHandler and return the HTTP status code 404 - NOT_FOUND.\nWhen you create a Spring Boot application in IntelliJ IDEA, it automatically creates a Spring Boot run configuration. Now run/debug the application using the BookmarksApplication run configuration, which should start the application on port 8080.\n\n\n\n\nTest API endpoints using the HTTP Client\nIntelliJ IDEA provides a built-in HTTP Client, which we can use to invoke our API endpoints and assert the responses.\nYou can open the HTTP Client by selecting Tools | HTTP Client | Create request in HTTP Client. Alternatively, you can also click on the API gutter icon on the API handler methods in BookmarkController.\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA will open a .http file. Once the application is started, you can invoke the GET /api/bookmarks endpoint and assert the response status code as follows:\n### Get all bookmarks\nGET http://localhost:8080/api/bookmarks\n\n> {%\nclient.test(\"Should get bookmarks successfully\", function () {\nclient.assert(response.status === 200, \"Response status is not 200\");\n});\n%}\nYou can click on the Run icon in the gutter to execute the API call.\nSimilarly, you can invoke other API endpoints as follows:\n### Get bookmark by id\nGET http://localhost:8080/api/bookmarks/1\n\n> {%\nclient.test(\"Should get bookmark successfully\", function () {\nclient.assert(response.status === 200, \"Response status is not 200\");\n});\n%}\n\n\n### Create bookmark successfully\nPOST http://localhost:8080/api/bookmarks\nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\n  \"title\": \"bookmark title\",\n  \"url\": \"https://bookmark.com\"\n}\n\n> {%\nclient.test(\"Should create bookmark successfully\", function () {\nclient.assert(response.status === 201, \"Response status is not 201\");\n});\n%}\nI will leave the rest of the API call invocations as an exercise for you. To learn more about the HTTP Client, you can refer to the documentation or watch The New HTTP Client presentation.\nSummary\nIn this article, we learned how to create a REST API performing CRUD operations using Spring Boot talking to a PostgreSQL database. We have verified whether the application is working as expected or not using the HTTP Client.\nYou can find the complete code in this GitHub repository.\nThe bookmarks application built in this article can also be implemented using Kotlin and IntelliJ IDEA offers the same features for Kotlin as well. You can checkout the Kotlin based implementation of the bookmarks application in kotlin branch of the repository.\nAs we have seen, IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate supports Spring in a way that makes it easy to build Spring Boot applications. Also, the JPA Buddy plugin makes developers more productive while using JPA and Spring Data JPA-based applications.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA\nTo learn more about JPA Buddy, you can watch this presentation or read the official documentation.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As Kotlin Multiplatform is now firmly established, development teams across the globe – including major companies like Shopify, Forbes, Haier, and Zürcher Kantonalbank – can harness its power in production environments. During Google I/O 2024 in May, Google announced their official support for Kotlin Multiplatform for sharing business logic across Android and iOS. This and other remarkable advancements set a strong foundation for further stabilizing and refining the technology.\nFor 2025, JetBrains is focused on enhancing the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem, including upgrading Compose Multiplatform for iOS to Stable, the first public releases of Kotlin-to-Swift export and the all-in-one KMP IDE, as well as other significant improvements to the core technology, tooling, and libraries. Read on to explore our key priorities and goals for the upcoming year.\nAdditionally, we recently updated our Kotlin roadmap to reflect our evolving vision. Be sure to check it out for more insights into our plans.\nCompose Multiplatform\nWe are committed to making Compose Multiplatform a framework that enables developers to create beautiful and performant applications, ensuring a consistent look across all supported platforms. Our primary focus is driving the iOS target to a Stable release, which will also enhance the experience for other targets.\nCurrently, we are concentrating on several key areas:\nJetpack Compose feature parity. We are working to ensure that all core APIs and components are multiplatform. Significant progress has been made, but we still have some remaining elements to address before the Stable release. Our focus is on infrastructural changes that will streamline this process.\niOS rendering performance. We have delivered significant improvements in rendering performance for iOS. Our next steps include implementing benchmarking infrastructure to catch regressions and to ensure that the performance of the framework is transparent to users.\nFeature completeness for core components. We are prioritizing the completion of essential features, including navigation, resource management, accessibility, and internationalization.\nStabilizing the interoperability between Compose and native views is also a key objective.\nGeneral stabilization of the framework. We are committed to improving the overall stability of the framework and enhancing the user experience through Compose Multiplatform Previews.\nDocumentation. Our goal is to provide users with all the resources they need to learn and use Compose Multiplatform in a single place. \nIn addition, for the web target, we are focusing on achieving feature parity with other platforms. This includes implementing drag-and-drop support, improving text input and rendering, and ensuring interoperability with HTML page contents. Compose Multiplatform for Desktop, already used in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA codebase, will also benefit from adopting newer APIs from Jetpack Compose, along with continuous performance improvements.\nThrough these initiatives, we aim to make Compose Multiplatform the best choice for building applications, allowing you to support any platform with just a single line of configuration.\nTooling\nWe remain committed to delivering an excellent development experience for Kotlin Multiplatform. Our goal is to reduce the need for developers to switch between different IDEs, offering a seamless and integrated workflow across platforms.\nWe aim to ensure that Kotlin Multiplatform integrates seamlessly with the IDEs commonly used for KMP development, such as IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio, making it more straightforward to share business logic or UIs.\nWhile we continue to prioritize strong KMP support for all existing platforms, we also believe there’s a place for a dedicated IDE. With this in mind, we are working towards the public release of a standalone KMP IDE. This IDE, based on JetBrains Fleet, will be tailored specifically for Kotlin Multiplatform development, offering an optimized, all-in-one environment. With this release, we focus on mobile scenarios and aim to:\nEnsure that developers no longer need to switch between different IDEs.\nProvide enhanced language support, delivering an equally great experience in both Kotlin and Swift, with a focus on seamless interoperability between the two.\nCreate a unified and simplified workflow that helps developers with experience in either iOS or Android to feel confident and productive when working with both platforms, offering clarity and consistency.\nLooking ahead, we are also exploring new areas to enhance the development experience:\nInvestigating the possibility of building apps for iOS platforms using cloud machines, which could help developers who don’t have access to Apple devices.\nExploring deeper integration with AI tools to assist not only in code generation but also in solving more complex development tasks, improving efficiency across the board.\nKotlin-to-Swift export\nWe are progressing rapidly with the direct Kotlin-to-Swift export. In 2024, we laid the foundation of the architecture and are now iterating to support more Kotlin features. Our current goal for 2025 is to release the first public version. This initial release aims to provide a user experience comparable to the existing Objective-C export, while overcoming the constraints of Objective-C. This will enable broader Swift language support and facilitate more seamless API exporting, paving the way for future improvements that will fully leverage the advantages of exporting to Swift.\nYou can track our progress on YouTrack or join the discussions in the #swift-export channel in our public Slack.\nLibrary ecosystem\nAs the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem rapidly expands, ensuring the backward compatibility of libraries becomes crucial. To achieve this, the JetBrains team and library creators must collaborate closely. Here’s what we plan to do:\nImprove the klib format to allow library creators to leverage their knowledge of building JVM libraries.\nImplement the same code-inlining behavior in Kotlin Multiplatform libraries as for the JVM.\nProvide a tool that ensures your multiplatform library public API remains compatible.\nWe’re also looking to improve the publishing process for Kotlin Multiplatform libraries, which includes:\nProviding templates and comprehensive guidelines for creating and publishing KMP libraries.\nStabilizing klib cross-compilation on different platforms.\nLaunching a fully re-designed KMP library publication process.\nSignificantly improving the libraries documentation process.\nEven though Kotlin Multiplatform is now Stable, we’re still planning significant updates. But don’t worry: Libraries built with the current format will still work with newer Kotlin versions.\nSearch for multiplatform libraries on the web\nWe are currently working on simplifying the search process for multiplatform libraries on the web. The library ecosystem is rapidly growing; there are now around 2,500 Kotlin Multiplatform libraries available. However, despite the extensive selection, it can often be challenging for developers to find libraries that meet their specific needs and support their chosen platforms.\nOur goal is to introduce a solution that facilitates the discovery of these libraries and allows developers to try them out easily, enhancing their overall experience within the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem. We’ll share more details about this initiative throughout the year, so stay tuned!\nAmper\nAmper, an experimental project configuration and build tool by JetBrains, has received positive feedback from early adopters, along with valuable bug reports, blockers, use cases, and feature requests. We appreciate this input, as it really helps us refine the scope and improve the product.\nIn 2025, we’ll be focusing on making Amper fully suitable for multiplatform mobile app development for Android and iOS, complete with shared Compose Multiplatform UI. This includes:\nRunning and testing applications (locally, on physical devices, and on CI).\nSigning applications and publishing them on Google Play and App Store.\nNumerous IDE features to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience.\nWe’ll also explore scenarios around server-side development, such as projects that include a backend for the mobile application with shared business logic.\nYou can follow the posts on the Amper blog to keep up-to-date with our latest releases and join the discussion in the #amper channel on the Kotlinlang Slack.\nGradle and other build tools\nAs we look ahead to 2025, our work on Gradle enhancements is outlined in the Kotlin roadmap. Here are some key areas we will be working on:\nSupport for declaring Kotlin Multiplatform dependencies at the project level. This will make it easier for developers to manage their project dependencies effectively.\nImproving integration of the Kotlin/Native toolchain into Gradle.\nImplementing the next-generation distribution format for multiplatform libraries. This initiative can simplify the dependencies model and publication layout for multiplatform libraries, making them easier to use with third-party build tools and reducing complexity for library authors.\nProviding full support for Kotlin Multiplatform in Declarative Gradle. Our work on the Experimental Kotlin Ecosystem Plugin, which supports Declarative Gradle, aims to help developers explore a declarative approach to their Gradle builds.\nWe’re also working on support for Gradle project isolation, publicly available API references for the Kotlin Gradle Plugin, and other initiatives. You can read about our other projects in the detailed Kotlin roadmap document.\nFurther reading\nKotlin roadmap\nCompose Multiplatform 1.7.0\nAmper Update August 2024\nKotlin 2.0.20",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "It’s time for the WebStorm 2024.3 EAP digest, which will walk you through the new features and improvements in the upcoming release!\n\n\n\n\nThe Toolbox App is the easiest way to get the EAP builds and keep both your stable and EAP versions up to date. You can also manually download the EAP builds from our website.\nDOWNLOAD WEBSTORM 2024.3 EAP\n\n\n\n\nImportant! WebStorm EAP builds are not fully tested and might be unstable. Please try the latest EAP build and share your feedback with us. You can do so using our issue tracker or by leaving a comment on this blog post.\n\n\n\n\nKey highlights\nImproved navigation and Rename refactoring for framework components\nStarting from version 2024.3, the Show component usages action for Vue, Svelte, and Astro detects component usages both in imports and templates. You can also use this functionality by invoking the Find Usages action on the component file in the Project view:\n\n\n\n\nThe Rename refactoring has been enhanced to include component usages renaming. When renaming a component file or explicitly defined name, the associated usages in templates will also be updated! This behavior can be disabled by toggling the Search for component usages option during the renaming process and in the Find dialog.\nAI Assistant\nImproved AI-based code completion\nIn 2024.3 we are significantly improving AI-driven code completion for JavaScript and TypeScript. The new approach combines fast, local full-line completion with powerful cloud-based suggestions powered by JetBrains’ in-house LLMs. This hybrid approach enhances speed, accuracy, and usability while reducing the frequency of lengthy and irrelevant suggestions.\nHere are some of the key improvements:\nHighlighting is now applied to the suggested code, which previously was just plain gray text.\nPartial acceptance allows you to apply suggestions granularly, giving you more control over changes to your code:\n\nAccept suggestions word by word – ⌥ → / Alt + Right.\nAccept suggestions line by line – ⌘ → / Ctrl + Right.\nAs before, you can explicitly call completion with ⇧ ⌥ / / Shift + Alt.\nWe’ve enhanced context collection using RAG strategies.\nCompletion suggestions are now provided in more locations, and are now triggered during typing, not only on Enter keystrokes.\n\n\n\n\nIn EAP 3, support for AI-based code completion has also been extended to HTML and CSS (including .css, .less, .scss, .sass, .pcss). Please refer to this blog post for more insights.\nInline AI prompts\nYou can now interact with AI Assistant directly in the editor thanks to an experimental inline input feature that detects and processes your requests as you type. This lets you express your intentions in natural language, which AI Assistant instantly interprets and converts into code changes without any extra steps. This feature is currently available for JavaScript and TypeScript:\n\n\n\n\nThe IDE leaves a purple mark in the gutter next to lines added or changed by AI Assistant so you can easily see what has been updated.\nIf you don’t like the initial suggestion, you can generate a new one by pressing Tab. You can also adjust the initial prompt by clicking on the purple block in the gutter or simply pressing Ctrl + / (Windows/Linux) or ⌘/ (macOS).\nPlease note that these improvements are available only when using the AI Assistant plugin.\nColor preview for Tailwind CSS classes\nColor previews for Tailwind CSS classes are now shown inline in the editor. We’ve added support for the textDocument/documentColor method of the Language Server Protocol (LSP), so all LSP-based plugins now support this functionality out of the box.\n\n\n\n\nBun debugger support for Windows\nIn EAP 2, we’ve introduced Bun debugger support for Windows. This update includes program traversal (Step Into, Step Over, and Run to Cursor), expression evaluation, and support for line breakpoints, exceptions, and conditional breakpoints.\nBun debugger support is currently unavailable on WSL. If you would like to see it added, consider voting for WEB-69167.\nCode style options for decorators\nWe have implemented new code style options for decorators in JavaScript and TypeScript. EAP 1 introduces four new items in the Wrapping and Braces subsection of the Code Style settings:\n\n\n\n\nUser experience\nUpdates to Find in Files\nThe Find in Files feature has a new search scope option: Project Files Excluding Git-Ignored. This option excludes any files ignored in .gitignore  from your search results, helping you narrow down the search scope to the relevant parts of your project.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight occurrences of selected text \nBy default, WebStorm will now automatically highlight all instances of the text you select within a file. You can toggle this feature in Settings | Editor | General | Appearance.\n\n\n\n\nOther highlights\nThe Database Tools and SQL plugin is now bundled in the IDE, and its licensing model will be changed in the upcoming major release.\nWebStorm now displays the .idea directory in the Project view by default. You can use the projectView.hide.dot.idea registry option to toggle this behavior (WEB-68009). \nThe Install dependencies notification will now automatically disappear once the required dependencies have been installed via the command line (WEB-65147).\nWe have improved navigation to built-in Nuxt components (WEB-65589, WEB-66625).\nYou can now use nx as the karma package to run unit tests in Nx projects (WEB-58994).\nThat’s it for today. For the full list of improvements introduced throughout the latest 2024.3 EAPs, check out the release notes.\nThe WebStorm team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "How Airbnb’s conversational AI platform powers LLM application development.\n\nBy Chutian Wang, Zhiheng Xu, Paul Lou, Ziyi Wang, Jiayu Lou, Liuming Zhang, Jingwen Qiang, Clint Kelly, Lei Shi, Dan Zhao, Xu Hu, Jianqi Liao, Zecheng Xu, Tong Chen\nIntroduction\nArtificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs) are a rapidly evolving sector at the forefront of technological innovation. AI’s capacity for logical reasoning and task completion is changing the way we interact with technology.\nIn this blog post, we will showcase how we advanced Automation Platform, Airbnb’s conversational AI platform, from version 1, which supported conversational systems driven by static workflows, to version 2, which is designed specifically for emerging LLM applications. Now, developers can build LLM applications that help customer support agents work more efficiently, provide better resolutions, and quicker responses. LLM application architecture is a rapidly evolving domain and this blog post provides an overview of our efforts to adopt state-of-the-art LLM architecture to keep enhancing our platform based on the latest developments in the field.\nOverview of Automation Platform\nIn a previous blog post, we introduced Automation Platform v1, an enterprise-level platform developed by Airbnb to support a suite of conversational AI products.\nAutomation Platform v1 modeled traditional conversational AI products (e.g., chatbots) into predefined step-by-step workflows that could be designed and managed by product engineering and business teams.\nFigure 1. Automation Platform v1 architecture.\nChallenges of Traditional Conversational AI Systems\nFigure 2. Typical workflow that is supported by v1 of Automation Platform.\nWe saw several challenges when implementing Automation Platform v1, which may also be broadly applicable to typical conversational products:\n\nNot flexible enough: the AI products are following a predefined (and usually rigid) process.\nHard to scale: product creators need to manually create workflows and tasks for every scenario, and repeat the process for any new use case later, which is time-consuming and error prone.\n\nOpportunities of Conversational AI Driven by LLM\nOur early experiments showed that LLM-powered conversation can provide a more natural and intelligent conversational experience than our current human-designed workflows. For example, with a LLM-powered chatbot, customers can engage in a natural dialogue experience asking open-ended questions and explaining their issues in detail. LLM can more accurately interpret customer queries, even capturing nuanced information from the ongoing conversation.\nHowever, LLM-powered applications are still relatively new, and the community is improving some of its aspects to meet production level requirements, like latency or hallucination.So it is too early to fully rely on them for large scale and diverse experience for millions of customers at Airbnb. For instance, it’s more suitable to use a transition workflow instead of LLM to process a claim related product that requires sensitive data and numbers of strict validations.\nWe believe that at this moment, the best strategy is to combine them with traditional workflows and leverage the benefits of both approaches.\nFigure 3. Comparison of traditional workflows and AI driven workflows\nArchitecture of LLM Application on Automation Platform v2\nFigure 4 shows a high level overview of how Automation Platform v2 powers LLM applications.\nHere is an example of a customer asking our LLM chatbot “where is my next reservation?”\n\nFirstly, user inquiry arrives at our platform. Based on the inquiry, our platform collects relevant contextual information, such as previous chat history, user id, user role, etc.\nAfter that, our platform loads and assembles the prompt using inquiry and context, then sends it to LLM.\nIn this example, the first LLM response will be requesting a tool execution that makes a service call to fetch the most recent reservation of the current user. Our platform follows this order and does the actual service call then saves call responses into the current context.\nNext, our platform sends the updated context to LLM and the second LLM response will be a complete sentence describing the location of the user’s next reservation.\nLastly, our platform returns LLM response and records this round of conversion for future reference.\nFigure 4. Overview of how Automation Platform v2 powers LLM application\nAnother important area we support is developers of LLM applications. There are several integrations between our system and developer tools to make the development process seamless. Also, we offer a number of tools like context management, guardrails, playground and insights.\nFigure 5. Overview of how Automation Platform v2 powers LLM developers\nIn the following subsections, we will deep dive into a few key areas on supporting LLM applications including: LLM workflows, context management and guardrails.\nWhile we won’t cover all aspects in detail in this post, we have also built other components to facilitate LLM practice at Airbnb including:\n\nPlayground feature to bridge the gap between development and production tech stacks by allowing prompt writers to freely iterate on their prompts.\nLLM-oriented observability with detailed insights into each LLM interaction, like latency and token usage.\nEnhancement to Tool management that is responsible for tools registration, the publishing process, execution and observability.\n\nChain of Thought Workflow\nChain of Thought is one of AI agent frameworks that enables LLMs to reason about issues.\nWe implemented the concept of Chain of Thought in the form of a workflow on Automation Platform v2 as shown below. The core idea of Chain of Thought is to use an LLM as the reasoning engine to determine which tools to use and in which order. Tools are the way an LLM interacts with the world to solve real problems, for example checking a reservation’s status or checking listing availability.\nTools are essentially actions and workflows, the basic building blocks of traditional products in Automation Platform v1. Actions and workflows work well as tools in Chain of Thought because of their unified interface and managed execution environment.\nFigure 6. Overview of Chain of Thought workflow\nFigure 6 contains the main steps of the Chain of Thought workflow. It starts with preparing context for the LLM, including prompt, contextual data, and historical conversations. Then it triggers the logic reasoning loop: asking the LLM for reasoning, executing the LLM-requested tool and processing the tool’s outcome. Chain of Thought will stay in the reasoning loop until a result is generated.\nFigure 7. High level components powering Chain of Thought in Automation Platform\nFigure 7 shows all high-level components powering Chain of Thought:\n\nCoT (Chain of Thought) IO handler: assemble the prompt, prepare contextual data, collect user input and general data processing before sending it to the LLM.\nTool Manager: prepare tool payload with LLM input & output, manage tool execution and offer quality of life features like retry or rate limiting.\nLLM Adapter: allow developers to add customized logic facilitating integration with different types of LLMs.\n\nContext Management\nTo ensure the LLM makes the best decision, we need to provide all necessary and relevant information to the LLM such as historical interactions with the LLM, the intent of the customer support inquiry, current trip information and more. For use cases like offline evaluation, point-in-time data retrieval is also supported by our system via configuration.\nGiven the large amount of available contextual information, developers are allowed to either statically declare the needed context (e.g. customer name) or name a dynamic context retriever (e.g. relevant help articles of customer’s questions ).\nFigure 8. Overall architecture of context management in Automation Platform v2\nContext Management is the key component ensuring the LLM has the access to all necessary contextual information. Figure 8 shows major Context Management components:\n\nContext Loader: connect to different sources and fetch relevant context based on developers’ customizable fetching logic.\nRuntime Context Manager: maintain runtime context, process context for each LLM call and interact with context storage.\n\nGuardrails Framework\nLLMs are powerful text generation tools, but they also can come with issues like hallucinations and jailbreaks. This is where our Guardrails Framework comes in, a safe-guarding mechanism that monitors communications with the LLM, ensuring it is helpful, relevant and ethical.\nFigure 9. Guardrails Framework architecture\nFigure 9 shows the architecture of Guardrails Framework where engineers from different teams create reusable guardrails. During runtime, guardrails can be executed in parallel and leverage different downstream tech stacks. For example, the content moderation guardrail calls various LLMs to detect violations in communication content, and tool guardrails use rules to prevent bad execution, for example updating listings with invalid setup.\nWhat’s Next\nIn this blog, we presented the most recent evolution of Automation Platform, the conversational AI platform at Airbnb, to power emerging LLM applications.\nLLM application is a rapidly developing domain, and we will continue to evolve with these transformative technologies, explore other AI agent frameworks, expand Chain of Thought tool capabilities and investigate LLM application simulation. We anticipate further efficiency and productivity gains for all AI practitioners at Airbnb with these innovations.\nWe’re hiring!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Unreal Engine modules help keep your code organized and modular. However, creating modules can be a tedious and error-prone process that involves manually editing configuration files and adding boilerplate code.\nVisual Studio 2022 version 17.11 comes with a new dialog to help with this process. With the new Add Module dialog, you can quickly add new modules to your project without leaving Visual Studio or manually editing configurations.\nHow to use the Add Unreal Engine Module dialog\nTo use the Add Unreal Engine Module dialog, you need to have an Unreal Engine project open in Visual Studio. You can do this by opening the .sln file generated by the Unreal Editor from your project folder, or by opening the Unreal Engine project directly by opening the folder containing the *.uproject file through File->Open->Folder….\n\nOnce you have your project open, right click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Add > Unreal Engine Item. This will open the Add New Item dialog, where you can select Empty Unreal Engine Module to launch the Add Unreal Engine Module dialog. This dialog lets you specify the name, type, loading phase, and path of your new module.\n\nAfter you click OK, Visual Studio will create the module folder and files for you and update the project settings accordingly. Visual Studio also updates the *.uproject file, registering the module there and makes sure that the module builds. You can then start writing your module code right away or use the Add Unreal Engine Class dialog to add new classes to your module.\nWhy use Unreal Engine modules\nUnreal Engine modules are a way of organizing your code into self-contained units that can be loaded and unloaded at runtime. Modules can contain C++ code, assets, shaders, blueprints, and other resources that are related to a specific functionality or feature.\nUsing modules has several benefits, such as:\nImproving code readability and maintainability by separating concerns and reducing coupling.\nEnhancing performance and memory usage by loading only the modules needed for a given context.\nEnabling code reuse and sharing by creating libraries of common or generic modules that can be used across different projects or platforms.\nSimplifying packaging and deployment by bundling modules together into plugins or DLCs.\nTo learn more about Unreal Engine modules, check out the official documentation.\nGive us your feedback\nWe hope you enjoy using the new Add Module dialog and find it useful for your Unreal Engine development. We’d love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how we can improve this feature and make Visual Studio even better for you.\nThank you for your continuous support and feedback, which helps us make Visual Studio the best tool for your development needs.\nThe post Create Unreal Engine modules faster appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

You can also choose to which module to add your class, so you can keep your code organized and modular.\n\nTo use this feature, you need to have an Unreal Engine project open in Visual Studio. Right click on the project in Solution Explorer and select Add > Unreal Engine Item. In the Add New Item dialog, select Unreal Engine Common Classes to open the Add Unreal Engine Class dialog. This dialog shows you a list of common Unreal Engine classes that you can use as a base for your new class. Once you select a base class, you can enter the name of your new class. You can also specify the module to which Visual Studio should add your class.\nWhen you click OK, Visual Studio will generate the header and source files for your new class and add them to your project. You can then open the files and start writing your code.\nBenefits of using the Add Unreal Engine Class dialog\nThe Add Unreal Engine Class dialog has several benefits over the previous way of adding Unreal Engine classes to your project. Some of the these benefits are:\nYou can choose from an expanded list of base classes by simply selecting one from the Base class list.\nYou can specify the module name for your class, which helps you organize your code into logical units. Modules are Unreal Engine plugins or projects that contain related classes and assets. By creating separate modules for your classes, you can improve the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of your code.\nYou can avoid naming conflicts and errors when adding classes to your project. The Add Unreal Engine Class dialog checks the validity of your class name and path and warns you if they conflict with an existing class or file. It also ensures that your class inherits from the correct base class and includes the necessary headers and macros.\nTry it out\nWe hope you enjoy using the Add Unreal Engine Class dialog in Visual Studio. This feature is part of our ongoing effort to improve the C++ development experience for game developers. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how we can make it even better. Please share your thoughts with us on Developer Community or Twitter.\nWe also want to thank you for your continuous feedback and support, which helps us make Visual Studio the best tool for developing games with Unreal Engine. Stay tuned for more updates and features coming soon.\nThe post Easily add Unreal Engine classes to your C++ project appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "코틀린에서 객체 생성과 값 타입 관리의 안전성을 강화하는 다양한 방법에 대해 알아보겠습니다. 이번 포스팅에서는 User라는 엔티티 클래스를 예로 들어 생성자 제약 사항을 안전하게 처리하는 방법과, value class를 활용해 값 타입을 효율적으로 관리하는 방법에 대해 설명하겠습니다.\n기존 생성자 코드의 문제점\n아래는 간단한 User 클래스입니다. 이 클래스는 JPA 엔티티로 정의되어 있으며, 데이터베이스와 매핑되는 사용자 정보를 나타냅니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\n@Entity(name = \"user\")\n@Table(name = \"user\")\nclass User(\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    var id: Long? = null,\n    var name: String,\n    val email: String,\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    var stats: UserStats\n)\n\n\n위 코드를 보면 객체 생성 시 다음과 같은 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n// 잘못된 객체 생성 예시\nval user = User(\n    id = 1L,  // 외부에서 설정하면 안 됨\n    name = \"  John Doe  \",  // 공백 제거 불가\n    email = \"  john.doe@example.com  \",  // 공백 제거 불가\n    stats = UserStats.ACTIVE  // 생성 시 초기값은 무조건 NORMAL이어야 함\n)\n\n\nid는 데이터베이스에서 자동으로 생성되기 때문에, 외부에서 객체 생성 시 값을 전달하면 안 됩니다.\nstats 필드는 초기 생성 시 무조건 UserStats.NORMAL이어야 하므로, 외부에서 제어권을 가지면 안 됩니다.\nname과 email 필드는 공백을 제거해야 하는데, 현재 생성자로는 이러한 처리가 어렵습니다.\n그 외에도 객체 생성 시 내부적으로 유효성 검사를 하는 것이 제한적입니다.\n\n이러한 문제들을 해결하기 위해, 우리는 안전한 객체 생성 방식을 도입할 수 있습니다.\nCompanion Object를 활용한 객체 생성 안전성 강화\n이 문제를 해결하기 위해, companion object와 operator fun invoke를 활용한 객체 생성 방식을 제안합니다. 아래는 수정된 코드입니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\nclass User private constructor(\n    var id: Long? = null,\n    var name: String,\n    val email: String,\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    var stats: UserStats\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            name: String,\n            email: String\n        ): User {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(name.isNotBlank()) { \"Name must not be blank\" }\n            require(email.isNotBlank()) { \"Email must not be blank\" }\n\n            return User(\n                name = name.trim(),\n                email = email.trim(),\n                id = null,\n                stats = UserStats.NORMAL\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n이제 외부에서 객체를 생성할 때는 다음과 같이 사용할 수 있습니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n// 안전한 객체 생성 예시\nval user = User(\n    name = \"  John Doe  \",\n    email = \"  john.doe@example.com  \"\n)\n\n\n위 코드는 기존의 생성자 호출 방식과 동일하게 사용할 수 있지만, 내부적으로는 안전한 로직을 적용하여 객체를 생성하도록 유도합니다. 이를 통해 불필요한 오류를 방지하고 객체 생성 과정을 간소화할 수 있습니다.\n주요 개선 사항\n\n기본 생성자 막기: private constructor를 사용해 기본 생성자를 외부에서 호출하지 못하게 막았습니다. 이를 통해 객체 생성을 companion object 내부의 로직으로만 유도할 수 있게 되었습니다.\ninvoke 연산자 활용: companion object에 operator fun invoke를 정의하여 객체 생성 시 사용자가 보다 명확한 API를 사용할 수 있게 했습니다. 이는 기존의 생성자 호출 방식과 동일하게 사용할 수 있으면서도 name과 email의 앞뒤 공백을 자동으로 제거하고, stats 필드는 무조건 UserStats.NORMAL로 설정하게 되었습니다.\n안전한 필드 초기화: id와 같이 외부에서 설정되면 안 되는 필드는 생성자에서 제외하여, 개발자가 실수로 이를 설정하는 것을 방지했습니다.\n\nValue Class를 활용한 값 타입 관리\n또한, 이메일과 같은 값 타입을 별도로 관리하기 위해 코틀린의 value class를 활용하는 것도 좋은 방법입니다. 아래는 Email이라는 값 클래스를 정의하고 사용하는 예시입니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n@JvmInline\nvalue class Email(val value: String) {\n    init {\n        require(value.isNotBlank()) { \"Email must not be blank\" }\n        require(value.contains(\"@\")) { \"Email must contain '@'\" }\n    }\n}\n\n\nEmail Value Class 적용\n위에서 정의한 Email 클래스를 User 클래스와 Order 클래스에 적용해보겠습니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n\nclass User private constructor(\n    var id: Long? = null,\n    var name: String,\n    val email: Email,\n    var stats: UserStats\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            name: String,\n            email: String\n        ): User {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(name.isNotBlank()) { \"Name must not be blank\" }\n\n            return User(\n                name = name.trim(),\n                email = Email(email),\n                id = null,\n                stats = UserStats.NORMAL\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Order 클래스 정의\nclass Order private constructor(\n    var id: Long?

CompositionLocalProvider을 좀 더 살펴보자.\n본문을 통해 하나씩 이야기해 보겠다.\nGetStream SDK 알아보기 - 링크\n읽기 전에\nXML Theme는 다루지 않는다.\nCompose component에 대해 설명하지 않는다.\nMaterial 3에서 사용하는 Token 방식의 Color 지정을 논하진 않는다.\nGetStream 후원으로 작성한 글이다.\n\nCompose에서 Theme가 필요할까?\nAndroid에서 Theme가 필요할까? XML을 다룰 때는 특별히 테마를 신경 쓰지 않고, 필요할 때(투명, 바텀, alert 등) 사용하고, XML 코드에 대부분 색상을 직접 지정하였다.\nCompose에서도 Theme 없이 만들 수 있지 않을까? Compose Theme가 필요한지 먼저 따져보기 전에 Android Studio에서 제공하는 기본 코드를 살펴보자.\nEmpty Activity 프로젝트를 생성하면 바로 확인할 수 있는 코드로, Material 3 기반 코드로 작성되어 있다.\nsetContent부터 MyApplicationTheme, Compose Component 조합으로 화면을 그리고 있다.\n\nclass MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        enableEdgeToEdge()\n        setContent {\n            MyApplicationTheme {\n                Scaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->\n                    Greeting(\n                        name = \"Android\",\n                        modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)\n                    )\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n기본 코드에서도 알 수 있지만 MyApplicationTheme {}이 시작 부분에 적용됨을 알 수 있다.\n여기서 고민해 볼 수 있는데 Theme {} 시작 부분을 꼭 가져야 할까?\n답은, 없는것보단 적용하는 것이 좋으며, Material을 따르지 않더라도 CustomTheme를 가지는 것이 좋다.\n우선 Theme가 없다면 아래와 같이 직접 코드 작성 시 Color와 TextStyle을 일일이 지정해야 한다.\n\nText(\n    text = \"Hello $name!\",\n    color = Color.Blue,\n    modifier = modifier\n)\n\n\n한두 줄이라면 크게 상관없겠지만 Theme라는 틀을 활용하면 요구사항을 빠르고, 유연하게 적용할 수 있다.\n없는 것보단 있는 것이 당연하지만 좋다.(Material을 따르지 않고 CustomTheme 사용하는 것은 또 다른 이야기가 된다.)\n\n구글에서 제공하는 Material 3를 사용하지 않는다면?\nTheme를 가지는 것은 당연하지만 좋은 선택이다. 하지만 Material 3을 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\n우선 Compose Material 3 라이브러리에는 아래와 같이 3개의 디펜던시를 필요로 한다.\nandroidx.compose.material3 - Material3 Theme를 포함하여 UI 요소를 포함\nandroidx.compose.foundation - UI 위에 가장 기본이 되는 Text/TextField 와 같은 부분을 적용\nandroidx.compose.ui - Compose 레이아웃을 포함한 구성\nandroidx.compose.runtime - 컴포즈의 프로그래밍 모델 및 상태 관리의 기본 구성 요소를 포함하는 핵심\n\n공식 문서 Jetpack Compose architectural layering - link 참고\n이 중 Material 3를 포함하지 않는 것을 말하거나, Material 3을 사용은 하지만 Theme는 따로 구성하는 것 역시 가능한 선택지이다.\n여기서 2가지를 이야기해 보겠다.\n\nCustom Theme를 만들면서 Material 3를 포함하지 않는다면?\n시간과 여유가 있다면 이 방식을 선택해도 무관하다. Compose 처음 나왔을 때는 Material Theme를 사용하지 않아도 된다는 이야기들이 많았었다.\n하지만 Material Theme 기반으로 제공해 주는 UI가 상당한데, 모든 Components 정보는 Material 3의 Components - 링크을 참고하길\nScaffold : TopBar, BottomBar, Content 영역을 포함하는 틀이다.\n    \n안드로이드 Compose Scaffold, TopAppBar 활용한 개발 - 링크\n안드로이드 Compose Material 2 컬러 정보를 알아보자 - 링크\nText : 기본 Material UI 가이드를 포함\nCheckbox\nRadioButton\nBottomSheet\nSnackbar\n등 이후에 새로 추가되는 요소들도 여기에 모두 포함된다. Material 3를 처음부터 사용하지 않고 만들겠다면 이와 동일한 코드를 직접 작성하겠다는 의미이거나, 내부 코드를 복사해서 우리만의 Theme를 만들겠다는 의미이다.\n이걸 정말 하는 것이 맞을까는 다른 이야기다. 이 모든 걸 다 직접 만들고 관리할 수 있는가?\n어차피 선택은 팀과 개인의 자유이지만 Color 정도의 Custom만으로도 충분히 좋은 코드를 만들 수 있다는 점에서는 이 방식이 좋은 선택지인지는 모르겠다.\n\nCustom Theme를 만들면서 Material 3를 포함한다면?\n필자는 이 방식으로 내부에서 사용할 Components를 재정의하여 사용하고 있고, Theme 역시 Material 3를 따르도록 설계해두었다.\n2년 전만 해도 이렇게 문서에 이 색상이 어디에서 적용되는지 알지 못하였지만 이젠 문서만 잘 보아도 이 색상을 어디에서 사용할 수 있는지 알 수 있다.\n\n이걸 기반으로 Custom Theme를 내부에 정의하여 사용하고 있는데 아래와 같은 형태다.\n\nobject SomeColor {\n\n    @Stable\n    val Color = Color(0xFF000000)\n}\n\n@Immutable\ndata class SomeColorScheme(\n    val primary: Color,\n    //...

Theme를 만드는 데 있어서 Color가 어느 지점에 적절하게 사용되어야 하는지를 알아야 하는데, 위에서도 언급했지만 다행히 구글이 문서를 갱신해 주었고, 적절한 위치의 색상 사용을 알 수 있다는 것이다.\nMaterial 3 Theme - 링크에서 Components를 확인.\n적용할 수 있는 Color set은 아래와 같은데 이 값들만 36가지 종류를 가진다는 점이다. 이 값을 모두 매핑해서 사용하기엔 부담이 크다.\n여담이지만 필자는 구글이 문서를 업데이트하기 전 이미 이 작업을 하였는데, 색상이 어디에서 사용되는지 일일이 다 찾아서 사용하였는데 이와 관련한 글을 남겼었다.\n안드로이드 Compose Material 2 컬러 정보를 알아보자 -

링크\n이 코드는 GetStream ChatTheme.kt - 링크의 코드 중 일부를 적은 부분인데, SDK로서의 역할을 할 수 있는 모든 부분을 담고 있다고 보아도 좋을 것 같다.\nSDK라면 지정해 준 정보를 내부에서 바꾸지 않고 그대로 활용함을 보장해야 하며\n외부에서 주입해 주는 커스텀 역시 충분히 제공하는 것이 좋다.\n라는 관점으로 보면 이 GetStream의 SDK로써는 충분히 유용하게 작성되었다는 점이다.\n문맥상 매우 길어져서 몇 가지 정보만 가져와보았으니 참고해 보면 좋을 듯하다.\n\n@Composable\npublic fun ChatTheme(\n    /* 생략 */\n    autoTranslationEnabled: Boolean = false, // 각종 옵션들\n    /* 생략 */\n    colors: StreamColors = if (isInDarkMode) StreamColors.defaultDarkColors() else StreamColors.defaultColors(), // color 정의\n    /* 생략 */\n    rippleTheme: RippleTheme = StreamRippleTheme, // Ripple 정의\n    attachmentFactories: List<AttachmentFactory> = StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories(), // 파일 첨부 정보\n    /* 생략 */\n    allowUIAutomationTest: Boolean = false, // 테스트 관련\n    dateFormatter: DateFormatter = DateFormatter.from(LocalContext.current), // 채팅에 사용할 date formatter\n    /* 생략 */\n    messagePreviewFormatter: MessagePreviewFormatter = MessagePreviewFormatter.defaultFormatter(\n        context = LocalContext.current,\n        typography = typography,\n        attachmentFactories = attachmentFactories,\n        autoTranslationEnabled = autoTranslationEnabled,\n    ),\n    /* 생략 */\n    attachmentsPickerTabFactories: List<AttachmentsPickerTabFactory> =\n        if (useDefaultSystemMediaPicker) {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactoriesWithoutStoragePermissions()\n        } else {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactories()\n        },\n    /* Theme 관련 생략 */\n    streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder = DefaultStreamMediaRecorder(LocalContext.current),\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit,\n)\n\n\n\n함수 안에도 조금 살펴보자.\nChatTheme의 코드 중에 눈에 띄는 코드는 allowUIAutomationTest 옵션을 별도로 제공한다는 점이다.\nallowUIAutomationTest - true/false를 제공함으로써 semantics를 활용한 UI Test 대응을 미리 해두었다는 점이다. 컴포즈에서 Ui test를 아직 시도하지는 않아서 자세한 내용은 문서를 참고해 보시길\nsemantics - 링크\n그 외에는 LocalXXX로 시작하는 코드들이 상당히 많이 보인다. LocalXXX 부분의 코드가 많이 보인다는 건 이 부분을 살펴보는 것이 도움이 될 수 있다는 점이다.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColors provides colors,\n        /* 생략 */\n        LocalComposerLinkPreviewEnabled provides isComposerLinkPreviewEnabled,\n) {\n    if (allowUIAutomationTest) {\n            Box(\n                modifier = Modifier.semantics { testTagsAsResourceId = allowUIAutomationTest },\n            ) {\n                content()\n            }\n        } else {\n            content()\n        }\n}\n\n\n\nGetStream의 CompositionLocalProvider 적용 부분은?\nStream에서 사용하는 CompositionLocalProvider는 모두 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다는 점이다.\n사실 Theme의 시작점이고 값의 변경은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 UI가 다시 그려짐을 보장하여도 될 것 같은데, compositionLocalOf을 사용하고 있다는 점이다.\n\nprivate val LocalColors = compositionLocalOf<StreamColors> {\n    error(\"No colors provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\nprivate val LocalDimens = compositionLocalOf<StreamDimens> {\n    error(\"No dimens provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\n\n\n그리고 또 하나 중요한 포인트는 private으로 Theme 이외에서는 이 값들을 업데이트하지 않음을 보장해 주고 있다.\n구글의 대표적인 Color 처리하는 코드는 아래와 같은데, Stream에서는 이 부분을 모두 private으로 적용한 부분을 그대로 활용할 수 있음을 보장한다.\n\nval LocalContentColor = compositionLocalOf { Color.Black }\n\n\nLocalContentColor는 언제 어디서든 값을 변경하고 업데이트할 수 있다.\n\nGetStream은 Theme에서 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용하여 값을 부르는 건 알겠는데?\nTheme의 범위를 어디까지 잡아야 할까? Stream의 코드 아랫 부분에 외부에서 사용할 수 있는 값들을 매핑하였는데 아래와 같다.\n\npublic object ChatTheme {\n    public val colors: StreamColors\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalColors.current\n\n    /* 생략 */\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current list of [StreamMediaRecorder] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    public val streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalStreamMediaRecorder.current\n}\n\n\n모든 정보는 ChatTheme.colors.xxx로 부르거나 ChatTheme.streamMediaRecorder.xxxx로 바로 활용할 수 있다는 점이다.\n그런데 Theme인데 streamMediaRecorder를 바로 불러다 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\n개인적으론 SDK라서 이를 활용하는 방식도 좋은 방법이라고 생각한다. 결국 CompositionLocalProvider를 통해 사용 범위를 명확히 지정하여 사용하고 있고, 이 값들은 초기에 지정해 준 정보를 그대로 사용하고 있음을 명시적으로 작성해두었기 때문에 특별히 문제는 없는 듯하다.\n하지만 일반적인 서비스에서 이렇게까지 하는 게 맞을까는 고민이 필요한 점이다.\n\nSomeTheme.triggerEvent.xxxx // 이렇게 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\nLocalTriggerEvent.current.xxxx // 이렇게 활용하는 것이 더 좋을까?\n\n\n\nCompositionLocalProvider를 좀 더 알아보자.\nCompositionLocalProvider을 깊이 있게 탐구하는 것은 아니지만 문서에 나와있는 내용을 좀 더 알아보고 넘어가자.\n\n결국 Theme는 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용한다.\nCompositionLocalProvider를 이용해 필요한 정보를 라이프 사이클에 맞게 불러다 활용할 수 있는데, Material 3 Theme 내부도 Stream에서의 코드와 마찬가지로 적용하고 있다.\nMaterialTheme는 크게 ColorScheme, Shapes, Typography를 주입받고, 내부에서 필요한 정보를 추가로 Provider에 셋하고 있다.\n\n@Composable\nfun MaterialTheme(\n    colorScheme: ColorScheme = MaterialTheme.colorScheme,\n    shapes: Shapes = MaterialTheme.shapes,\n    typography: Typography = MaterialTheme.typography,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    val rippleIndication = androidx.compose.material.ripple.rememberRipple()\n    val selectionColors = rememberTextSelectionColors(colorScheme)\n    CompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColorScheme provides colorScheme,\n        LocalIndication provides rippleIndication,\n        androidx.compose.material.ripple.LocalRippleTheme provides MaterialRippleTheme,\n        LocalShapes provides shapes,\n        LocalTextSelectionColors provides selectionColors,\n        LocalTypography provides typography,\n    ) {\n        ProvideTextStyle(value = typography.bodyLarge, content = content)\n    }\n}\n\n\n이 중 colorScheme은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 초기화하고 있고,\n\ninternal val LocalColorScheme = staticCompositionLocalOf { lightColorScheme() }\n\n\nselectionColors은 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다.\n\nval LocalTextSelectionColors = compositionLocalOf { DefaultTextSelectionColors }\n\n\n결국 이 둘을 잘 알면 유용하게 사용할 수 있다는 의미이니 문서를 참고해 보자.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider란?\nLocally scoped data with CompositionLocal - 링크이란 공식 문서이다.\ncompostionLocalProvider에는 2개의 초기화 방법을 제공한다.\ncompositionLocalOf : 현재 범위 내에 compositionLocal의 정보가 변경되었을 경우 해당 범위 내의 이 값을 사용하는 범위를 갱신\n    \nContentColor를 범위 내에서 color 변경한다면 이 색상을 호출하여 사용하는 곳을 추적하여 UI를 갱신\nstaticCompositionLocalOf : 이 값은 범위 내의 값을 추적하지 않고 그냥 전부 새로 그림.\n    \nContentColor를 이 값으로 활용할 경우 화면을 전부 새로 그림\n이 두 함수의 영향 범위는 매우 다름을 알 수 있다.\n이전에 작성한 Compose에서 웹뷰를 유지하는 방법에서는 staticCompositionLocalOf 활용하는 방법을 소개했었으니 참고해 보셔도 좋다.\nCompose Navigation - WebView Recomposition 해결? - 링크\nstaticCompositionLocalOf은 값이 명확하게 1회 초기화하며 이후에는 변경하지 않음을 명시할 경우 활용하는 것이 좋고, compositionLocalOf는 언제든 변경되고, 이 값이 변경되었을 경우 값을 사용한 부분도 UI 갱신이 일어나야 하는 경우 이를 활용하는 것이 좋다.\n이 내용을 깊이 있게 알고 싶다면 Jetpack Compose Internals의 4장 Compose UI, 측정 정책 (Measuring policies) 부분에서 매우 상세하게 다루고 있으니 책을 참고하여 추가 학습하시길\nJetpack Compose Internals 한국어 번역(번역 엄재웅, 류기민) - 링크\n\n마무리\n이 글은 GetStream의 후원을 받아 작성하였다. GetStream의 내부 Theme 활용을 글로 담았는데, SDK를 만든다면 이런 형태로의 Theme를 활용할 수 있구나를 파악할 수 있었다.\n거기에 결국 Theme 값을 유지하면서 상태를 보장해 주는 방식을 private으로 잘 구분하여 사용해야 하며, Theme를 통해 더 많은 값을 불러다 활용할 수 있도록 만들어주는 것 역시 가능함을 알 수 있었다.\n이런 방식에서는 사실 호불호가 생길 수 있긴 하다.\nTheme인데 왜 Theme와 관련 없는 설정 정보를 포함하는 것인가?\n초기화만 하고, Theme가 아닌 접근 방법을 제공하면 더 좋은 거 아닐까?\n이 부분은 코드 컨벤션과 관련이 있지 않을까 싶다. SomeTheme.value.xxxx를 사용하였을 때 LocalXXX.current를 기억하고 사용하는 행위를 반대로 줄일 수 있으니 말이다.\n이 글로 Theme를 구성하는 전반적인 방법이나 CompositionLocal 사용을 다 알 수 있는 것은 아니지만 Theme를 이렇게까지 활용하고 접근 제어를 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을지만 이해해도 다행이라고 생각한다.\nMaterial 3에서 사용하는 Token 방식의 Color 지정을 논하진 않았는데 이 방식은 figma와 밀접한 관련이 있다고 하니 아래 링크를 참고하시길\nm3 Design tokens - 링크\nGetStream SDK 알아보기 - 링크",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 벤처파트너로 활동하고 있는 악셀러레이터 프라이머는 일 년에 두 번의 데모데이를 개최한다. 10~15개 회사가 5분 발표를 하는데, 데모데이가 끝나면 항상 참석자들에게 듣는 말은 회사들이 모두 발표를 너무나 잘 한다는 것이다. 어쩜 5분 동안 본인들이 하는 사업에 대해서 저렇게 명확하게 설명할 수 있는지 모두 다 감탄한다. 원래 발표를 잘하는 창업가들도 많지만, 실은 프라이머 회사들의 발표는 대부분 엄청난 연습과 리허설을 통해서 다듬어지고 만들어지는 훌륭한 무대 공연이다.\n대표 전원이 나를 포함한 한국에 있는 프라이머의 액팅 파트너분들과 약 4주에 걸쳐 세 번의 데모데이 리허설을 한다. 나도 이제 거의 8년째 프라이머 데모데이 리허설을 같이 준비하고 있는데, 매번 느끼는 거지만 첫 번째 리허설 이후엔 이 발표 실력으로 과연 데모데이를 할 수나 있을지 매우 의심스럽다. 자료도 못 만들었고, 어떤 사업을 하는지도 모르겠고, 발표를 들은 후에 오히려 이 회사에 투자하고 싶은 마음이 없어질 정도로 임팩트도 없고 재미가 없다. 하지만, 또 희한한 건, 매우 직설적이고 건설적인 피드백을 열심히 제공하면 두 번째 리허설에서 훨씬 발전된 모습을 볼 수 있다. 세 번째 리허설에서는 완전히 새로운 사람이, 새로운 사업으로, 새로운 발표를 하는 느낌이 들 정도로 모두가 무대 체질로 바뀌고, 실제 데모데이에서는 대부분 완벽한 피칭을 한다. 사람의 능력엔 한계가 없고, 연습을 열심히 하면 무조건 완벽한 발표를 할 수 있다. 그 누구든.\n첫 번째 리허설 이후에 내가 모든 창업가들에게 드리는 공통 피드백이 세 가지가 있다.\n첫째는 사업에 대해 설명을 하지 말고, 기-승-전-결이 있는 매우 재미있는 스토리텔링을 하라고 한다. 두 번째는 딱딱하게 이야기하지 말고 항상 재미있는 이야기를 하라고 한다. 세 번째는 본인들이 청중이라고 생각하고, 본인들이 듣고 싶은 발표를 하라고 한다.\n결국 위 세 가지 피드백 모두 사업가/창업가가 아니라 이야기꾼이 돼서 재미있는 이야기를 청중에게 하라는 것이다. 솔직히 사업 설명은 어떻게 보면 굉장히 딱딱하고 심각하고 재미가 없는 내용이 더 많다. 우리도 하루에 평균 3~5개의 미팅을 하는데, 정말 재미없는 창업가 5명과 만나는 날은 집에 갈 때 매우 피곤하다. 어떤 분은 미팅 시작 5분 만에 그냥 미팅룸을 나가고 싶을 정도로 에너지도 없고, 딱딱하고, 듣는 사람과 양방향 커뮤니케이션을 못 한다. 보통 이런 미팅을 하면 내 이야기에 상대방이 어떻게 반응하는지 리액션도 확인하고, 상대방의 눈빛도 보면서 분위기를 조절하면서 이야기해야 하는데, 이런 건 전혀 없고 그냥 본인이 하고 싶은 이야기만 한다. 이런 분과 이야기하면 미팅 시간 내내 집중이 잘 안되고, 끝난 후에는 어떤 이야기를 했는지 잘 기억도 안 난다.\n반면에 어떤 창업가들은 타고난 이야기꾼들이다. 이런 분들은 제품이 없어도, 매출이 없어도, 아직 뭐 하나 제대로 못 만들었어도, 1시간이라는 미팅 시간이 5분 같이 느껴질 정도로 스토리텔링을 완벽하게 한다. 창업가 본인은 어떤 사람인지, 왜 이 사업을 하는지, 마치 잘 짜인 단편소설 같은 이야기를 해준다. 목소리의 톤앤매너도 너무 좋고, 이런 이야기꾼들이 가장 잘하는 건, 본인의 말에 상대방이 어떻게 반응하는지, 그리고 어떤 리액션을 보이는지 잘 관찰한 후에 계속 대화를 이어 나간다. 표정, 제스처, 아이 컨택트, 이 모든 걸 자연스럽게 한다. 이런 창업가를 하루에 한 분만 만나도 그날 집에 갈 땐 기분이 좋다.\n물론, 모든 이야기꾼이 좋은 창업가나 사업가는 아니다. 하지만, 내 경험에 의하면 이 반대는 사실이다. 내가 아는 모든 좋은 창업가와 사업가는 괜찮은 이야기꾼이다. 이 세상에 재미있는 이야기를 싫어하는 사람은 없고, 재미있는 이야기로 투자자의 관심을 끌 수 있다면, 더 깊은 대화를 나눌 확률이 높아진다.\n난 원래 재미없는 사람인데 어떡하냐고 생각을 하고 있다면, 이 또한 연습하면 된다. 연습하고, 연습하고, 또 연습하면 좋은 이야기꾼이 될 수 있다.",

최소 50%는 저축해야 나중에 잘 살 수 있다고 하지만, 그게 쉽지만은 않죠.\n그래도 미래의 나를 위해 현재의 소비를 줄이고 자금을 모아 불리려는 노력을 하는 분들이 많을 것입니다. 10년, 20년 뒤의 내 소득이 지금과 같거나 비슷할거라 보장할 수 없고, 나이가 들수록 일자리를 얻는 것이 쉽지 않기 때문에 소득은 지금보다 줄어들 가능성이 크기 때문이에요.\n많은 사람들이 젊을 때 돈을 아껴서 저축하고, 나이가 들어 소득이 줄어들면 그동안 모은 자산을 꺼내 쓰며 소비를 유지하려고 합니다. 이렇게 하면 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}노후에 소득이 줄어도 인생 전체에서 소비 수준을 일정하게 유지할 수 있기 때문입니다.\n이처럼 현재 소비하는 기준이 현재 소득만 고려하는 것이 아니라, 평생의 소득을 염두하여 결정해야 한다는 이론을 ‘생애주기가설’이라고 합니다. 이 이론은 이탈리아 경제학자 프랑코 모딜리아니(Franco Modigliani)가 1950년대에 제안한 것인데요. 1980년대에 접어들며 은퇴 설계의 중요한 이론으로 자리 잡았습니다.\n생애주기가설에 따라 각 생애주기 별 금융생활을 어떻게 설계하면 좋을지 예시를 들어드릴게요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}\n① 유아기: 아동수당 적금 상품 가입, 백일·돌 선물로 받는 금 모아두기\n② 아동, 청소년기: 예금·주식·채권 등 금융 상품 공부, 용돈 관리를 위한 용돈기입장 작성하기\n③ 20대: 월급의 50% 저축, 세금 혜택 있는 금융 상품 가입하기\n④ 30대: 개인 연금 가입, 주택 마련 준비\n⑤ 40대: 대출 상환, 양육·노후 등 목적별 자산 분리\n⑥ 50대: 은퇴 설계, 중위험·중수익 투자로 전환\n⑦ 60대 이상: 현금흐름 관리\n\n이 예시가 반드시 따라야 하는 정답은 아니지만, 어느 정도 발맞춰 따라간다면 노후에 소득이 부족해 허덕이는 일을 미리미리 예방할 수 있을 겁니다. 지금 이 아티클을 확인했을 때가 가장 빠른 때라 생각하고, 바로 시작할 수 있는 것은 무엇일지 생각해보고 실천에 옮겨보시길 추천드립니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}\"'장수의 축복' 누리려면…어릴때부터 재테크 공부해야\n(연합뉴스 2024.9.30)\n경제학자 프랑코 모딜리아니는 이러한 문제를 예견한 듯 생애 주기 가설(Life-Cycle Hypothesis)을 제시했습니다. 그는 사람들이 생애 전반에 걸쳐 소득의 변화를 감안해 소비와 저축을 조율한다고 설명했으며, 이 이론으로 1985년 노벨 경제학상을 수상했습니다.\n이 가설에 따르면 사람들은 경제활동을 활발히 하는 청·장년기에는 저축을 하고, 노년기에는 그 저축을 사용해야 합니다. 그러나 오늘날 한국 사회에서 경제활동 인구의 사회 진출은 늦어지고, 은퇴는 앞당겨졌지만, 수명은 길어졌습니다. 즉 소득이 높은 경제활동 기간은 짧아지고, 소득이 낮은 노년기는 더 길어진 셈입니다.\n모딜리아니의 이론에 따르면 지금의 청·장년 세대는 부모 세대보다 더 높은 저축률을 유지해야 합니다. 하지만 현실은 그렇지 않습니다. 저축률보다 가계부채가 더 빠르게 증가하고 있기 때문입니다. 국민연금과 국민건강보험 등 사회적 안전망이 저출산과 고령화로 인해 한계에 부딪히고 있다는 사실을 많은 사람이 인식하고 있음에도 실제 노후 준비에는 반영되지 않고 있습니다. 이는 노후 대비가 더욱 복잡하고, 개인적인 차원의 준비가 중요해졌음을 시사합니다.\n과거 장수(長壽)는 축복으로 여겨졌습니다. 돌잔치에서 아이가 돌잡이 상에서 장수의 상징인 '실'을 잡으면 모두가 기뻐했고, 장수한 노인은 마을의 자랑이 되곤 했습니다. 하지만 이제는 장수가 축복만은 아닙니다. 생명보험 업계에서는 질병, 사고와 더불어 '장수 리스크'라는 새로운 개념이 등장했습니다.\n사람들은 장수로 인해 더 오랜 시간 동안 경제적·사회적 지원이 필요하게 되었고, 이는 노후 준비를 더욱 복잡하게 만들었습니다. 앞으로는 더 많은 사람이 이 '장수 리스크'를 직시하고 준비해야 합니다. 부모 세대의 노후 준비 방식을 그대로 답습하는 것이 아니라, 자신의 수명과 경제적 상황을 고려한 맞춤형 준비가 필요합니다. 장수는 여전히 축복일 수 있지만, 그것을 어떻게 준비하느냐에 따라 그 축복은 달라질 것입니다.(중략)\n\n\n노후 준비의 중요성은 누구나 공감하는 바지만, 여전히 많은 사람들이 적절한 대비를 하지는 못하고 있습니다. 사회 진출 시기가 늦어지고 은퇴 시기는 빨라지면서 경제활동 기간은 점점 짧아지고 있기 때문인데요. 더군다나 평균 수명까지 늘어나면서 소득이 없는 노년기가 점차 길어지고 있습니다.\n이런 상황 속에서 많은 이들이 짧은 경제활동 기간 동안 벌어들인 소득만으로 길어진 노후를 대비하는 데에 여전히 부족함을 느끼고 있어요. 은퇴 후 살아야 할 시간이 늘어났지만, 충분한 저축을 하지 못한 채로 은퇴를 맞이한 많은 사람들이 노후 빈곤에 허덕이고 있습니다.\n이렇게 오래 살게 될 것이라는 불확실성은 ‘장수 리스크'라는 새로운 경제적 고민을 동반하게 합니다. 젊을 때 소비를 줄이고 저축을 늘리게 만들고요. 그러나 저축만 하는 것은 근본적인 해결책이 되기 어렵습니다. 본인에게 맞는 자산 불리는 방법을 반드시 찾아내어, 각자의 상황에 맞는 맞춤형 노후 준비를 철저히 해야 합니다.\n우선 국민연금만으로는 충분하지 않기 때문에, .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}퇴직연금 등 다양한 방법으로 소득을 보충해야 합니다. 특히 저금리 시대에는 저축만으로는 충분한 노후 자금을 마련하기 어렵기 때문에, 투자를 통한 자산 증식도 필수적입니다. 최근에는 인컴 자산, 임대 수입, 배당주 투자를 통해 은퇴 후에도 소득원을 만드는 방법도 다양해지고 있으니까요, 내게 맞는 방법을 찾아 반드시 ‘실행’하는 게 가장 중요합니다.\n길어진 노후를 대비해 다양한 소득원을 확보하고, 더 이상 은퇴 이후 삶이 불안하지 않도록 미리 젊을 때부터 준비가 절실합니다. 그래야 장수가 다시금 축복으로 여겨질 수 있을 테니까요.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n장수 리스크: 사람들이 더 오래 살게 되면서 노후 자금이 부족해질 위험을 의미. 예상보다 긴 수명으로 인해 경제적 준비가 충분하지 않다면 은퇴 후 빈곤층으로 떨어질 수 있어요.\n사회적 안전망: 국민연금, 국민건강보험 등 정부가 제공하는 제도. 국민의 노후와 건강을 지원하는 제도이기는 하나, 고령화와 저출산의 영향으로 사회적 안전망의 지속 가능성에 대한 우려가 심각해요.\n개인연금: 국민연금 외에 개인이 추가적으로 가입하는 연금 상품. 노후 자금을 더 탄탄히 준비하기 위해 꼭 필요한 수단이에요. 특히 길어진 노후를 대비하기 위해 개인연금의 역할이 점점 더 중요해지고 있어서, 정부에서도 세제 혜택을 강화하는 중입니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",

모셔야 한다는 목표로 한 분 한 분 컨택하던 중, 채용팀은 이런 생각을 하게 됐는데요. ‘업계에 있는 유능한 개발자는 모두 토스에 지원하게 해야 하는 거 아냐?’\n그러려면 이미 토스에 지원해본 사람이 아닌, ‘토스에 한 번도 지원한 적 없는 사람’도 토스에 관심을 가지게 만들어야겠다는 생각으로 이어졌어요. 토스 외부에 계신 분들을 대상으로 설문조사를 진행했고, 그분들이 이직할 때 우선순위로 고려하는 것이 무엇인지 알아내고자 했습니다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}공통적으로 나왔던 답변은 바로 ‘우수한 동료’. 이걸 힌트 삼아 토스가 가진 우수한 기술력과 팀원들의 뛰어난 역량을 더 적극적으로 외부에 알리기로 했어요.\n토스 외에도 토스뱅크, 토스증권, 토스페이먼츠 등 여러 계열사가 생겨날 때라, 다양하고 깊이 있는 기술 사례를 세션으로 풀어낼 수 있었습니다. 첫 SLASH 21은 총 19개의 세션으로 진행됐고, 토스 개발자들이 기술을 대하는 태도를 담은 오프닝 키노트부터 서버 인프라 모니터링 경험, SRE 사례 소개, 데이터의 흐름과 활용법, 프론트엔드 클린 코드까지 다양한 테크 영역의 이야기를 다뤘어요.\n당시 팬데믹으로 오프라인 행사 진행이 어려워 컨퍼런스는 온라인으로 진행되었는데도, 참가자분들이 보내주신 관심과 평가는 감동적이었습니다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px

잡았습니다. 2021, 2022, 2023년에는 온라인에서 2024년에는 오프라인에서 진행된 SLASH가 어떤 여정을 거쳐 발전해 왔는지 보여드리려 해요.\n온라인으로 진행되어 온 SLASH, 3년의 변천사\n매년 진행하는 컨퍼런스이지만, 사람들에게 늘 새롭게 기억될 수 있길 바라는 마음으로 기획해 왔습니다. 그 해에 꼭 담아내고 싶은 메시지를 뽑아내고, 이전에 본 적 없던 신선한 키 비주얼과 컨셉을 활용했어요. 전통적인 컨퍼런스 이미지에서 벗어나 ‘토스만의 이미지’를 보여주고자 했던 노력의 일환을 연도 별로 담아봤어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0

User, No Technology\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\nSLASH 21에서는 이런 질문들에 대한 답을 담았습니다.\n‘토스에서는 어떤 기술을 쓰고 있을까?’\n‘그 기술은 어떻게 구현되고 있을까?’\n‘토스 기술의 기반을 이루는 것은 어떤 것들일까?’\n토스에서 사용하는 기술 자체가 특별한 것은 아니지만, 토스팀 엔지니어들이 문제를 해결해 나가는 특별한 방식을 세션에 녹여냈는데요. 그 방식이 특별한 이유는, 사용자들이 가장 원하는 서비스, 해결하고 싶은 문제 자체를 실현하는 데에 토스 엔지니어링 팀의 기술과 에너지를 집중해왔기 때문입니다.\n오직 사용자 중심으로 진화해온 토스의 기술 혁신. 사용자 입장에서 이해하기 쉽고 직관적인 서비스를 만드는 것, 그와 동시에 기존의 금융 서비스를 이용하며 느끼는 불편과 의문을 해소시키는 일에는 항상 기술적인 도전이 뒤따랐습니다. 더 나아가 완전히 새롭고 혁신적인 경험을 줄 수 있는 방법을 모색하고 기술적으로 구현하는 과정도 있었기에, 이 이야기를 더 많은 분들과 나누고 싶었습니다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

21 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\nSLASH 21을 준비하는 과정을 돌이켜 보면, 컨퍼런스 이름을 정하는 과정에서부터 토스만의 색깔을 녹여내기 위해 많은 논의를 거쳤습니다. 컨퍼런스 이름인 SLASH는 개발할 때 명령어 앞에 사용되는 ‘/’ 기호를 말합니다. 토스 사용자들의 삶에 유의미한 변화를 만들어내기 위해, 관습을 깨고 기술 혁신의 획을 그었다는 의미로 ‘긋다'라는 중의적 의미도 담아냈어요. 더 나아가 컨퍼런스 전체를 관통하는 키 그래픽을 만드는 데도 공을 들였는데요. ‘/’ 기호를 3D 그래픽을 활용해 입체적으로 구현하고, 다각도로 움직이는 모습을 구현해 냈습니다.\n.css-oni540{position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;}\n.css-122y91a{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;}\n\n한발 더 나아가 개발 생태계 선순환에 기여하기 위한 깜짝 이벤트도 준비했었는데요. 참가자들이 컨퍼런스에 사전 신청을 하면 개발 커뮤니티의 성장과 생태계 발전에 기여할 수 있는 이벤트를 기획했어요. 총 1억 원이 넘는 금액이 모였고, 후원금은 토스에서 전액 지원하는 방식으로 개발자 컨퍼런스를 후원하였습니다.\n\n🚩 SLASH 22 - No User, No Technology\n\n2021년에 ‘토스가 첫 개발자 컨퍼런스를 열었다’는 메시지는 잘 전달되었는데, 우리가 꼭 알리고 싶었던 슬로건 ‘No User, No Technology’는 잘 전달이 안 됐다는 것을 설문조사를 통해 확인할 수 있었어요.\n늘 사용자 관점에서 기술을 고민하고 고객 중심으로 서비스를 만들어내는 토스인 만큼, 이 슬로건을 더 잘 알릴 필요가 있다는 생각으로 2022년에도 동일한 슬로건을 활용했습니다. 2022년에는 슬로건을 전면에 내세워 사람들에게 잘 인지시키도록 해보자는 목표로 컨퍼런스가 기획되었어요.\n2021년보다 2022년에 더 많이 신경썼던 것은 세션의 퀄리티인데요. 참가자분들이 따로 시간을 내어 참석하시는 만큼 세션에서 얻어가는 것이 많았으면 하는 바람이었습니다. 각 엔지니어링 챕터 리드, 테크니컬 라이터, 커뮤니케이션 팀까지 3단계 검수 프로세스를 거쳤고, 연사분들이 촬영에 들어가기 전까지 부족한 부분을 채울 수 있도록 리허설도 진행했습니다. 스피치 코치도 따로 모셔서 어디를 어떻게 강조해야 하는지, 어디에서 쉬어가야 하는지 등 세세한 피드백을 제공하며 세션 퀄리티를 높였고요.\n\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper

22 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\n키 비주얼 사이드에서는 ‘개발자 오브제'를 3D 에셋으로 만드는 작업이 진행됐어요. 개발자 컨퍼런스인 만큼 개발자분들에게 친숙한 오브제를 활용해 컨퍼런스도 친숙하게 느껴지게 만드는 것이 목표였습니다. 커피, 헤드셋, 키보드 등 개발자분들에게 친숙한 것들을 선정해 둥둥 떠다니는 3D 에셋으로 만들었죠. 세션 리스트에 하나하나 넣어서 토스다운 이미지를 전달하고자 했습니다.\n\n\n\n🚩 SLASH 23 - The Hidden Side of Technology\n\n2022년에는 세션 퀄리티를 높이는 방법을 시도했으니 2023년에는 키 비주얼, 컨셉 또한 더 세련되게 풀어내고자 했어요. 이전과 다르게 완전히 새로운 슬로건을 세우고, 토스에서도 이전에 해본 적 없던 방식의 크리에이티브한 키 비주얼을 활용했습니다. 여러모로 새로운 도전이 돋보인 SLASH였던 거죠.\n슬로건은 ‘The Hidden Side of Technology’로, 쉽고 간편한 토스 서비스 이면에 정말 꼼꼼하고 치열한 논의 끝에 채택된 기술이 흐르고 있다는 것을 보여주기 위해 선정됐습니다. ‘토스, 너무 편하고 쉬운데 보안은 약한 거 아냐?’라는 이미지를 깨기 위함이었죠. \n전체적인 세션 내용에서 편하고 쉽고 빠른 서비스를 제공하면서도 보안을 지키기 위해 토스 엔지니어링 조직의 치열한 노력이 수반된다는 것을 보여주면서, 토스 전반의 브랜딩에도 기여하기 위한 목표를 세웠어요.\n\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper

23 세션 top 3 살펴보기 \n\n키 비주얼은 그동안 토스에서 많이 활용해왔던 3D 에셋을 벗어나, 2D 애니메이션을 기획해보는 방향을 선택했습니다. ‘릭 앤 모티’ 2D 애니메이션 컨셉으로 5명의 개발자 캐릭터를 만들어 오프닝 필름을 만들었어요. ‘토스는 개발자 컨퍼런스도 다르다'는 이미지를 주기 위함이었습니다.\n\n\n\n실제로 설문을 통해서도 “개발자로서 자부심 느껴지는 애니메이션”, “토스가 브랜딩에 대해 많이 고민하는 모습이 보인다. 작년보다 훨씬 친근하게 각인됐다\", “감탄하면서 봤다. 진짜 작정했구나 싶어 소름 돋았다\" 등 오프닝 필름에 대한 긍정적인 의견을 많이 받아볼 수 있었고요.\n드디어 오프라인에서 진행된 SLASH 24\n\n왜 화면 밖으로 향했냐면\n2021년 SLASH를 처음 기획할 때부터 ‘컨퍼런스는 오프라인'이라는 생각이 있었어요. 하지만 당시에는 팬데믹 시기였기 때문에, 선택의 여지 없이 온라인으로만 진행해야 했죠.\n그런데 펜데믹 이전의 ‘컨퍼런스'를 떠올리면 직접 대면해 명함 주고받으며 네트워킹도 하고, 같은 시간 한 장소에 다같이 모여 행사의 열기를 느끼는 것이 일반적이었던 거예요. 제약이 없어진 만큼 이번 컨퍼런스는 오프라인에서 진행하지 않을 이유가 없었습니다.\n무엇보다 SLASH 컨퍼런스의 목표는 ‘채용’이었기 때문인데요. 컨퍼런스 참가자분들이 채용으로 이어지려면 온라인보다는 오프라인이 효과적일 거라 기대했습니다. 직접 만나 이야기 나눠보시면, 토스팀에 없던 관심을 충분히 이끌어낼 수 있다는 자신감이 있었어요.\n\nNo Limit: 풀지 못할 문제는 없다\n이번 SLASH 24 슬로건은 ‘한계 없는 도전, 그리고 실패해도 일어나는 끈기'라는 심상을 뽑아내는 데에 집중한 문장인데요. 그 기저에는 토스의 개발 문화가 큰 몫을 했습니다. 토스의 모든 엔지니어들이 한계없이 도전하고 있다는 것을 많은 곳에서 체감할 수 있었기 때문이죠.\n메시지 개발 단계에서는 크게 3가지 포인트에서 중점적으로 고민했습니다.\n1) 기술 관련 이야기 외에도 토스만이 할 수 있는 이야기가 무엇인가?\n2) 참가자에게도 울림을 줄 수 있는 메시지는 무엇인가?\n3) 오프라인에서 더 임팩트 있게 전달될 수 있는 메시지는 무엇인가?\n이 3가지를 모두 아우를 수 있는 교집합을 찾기 위해, 그간 SLASH에 참여해주셨던 분들의 피드백을 샅샅이 뒤졌어요. ‘기술에 대해 이야기하는 컨퍼런스이지만 틀을 깨는 도전과 시도를 많이 한다', ‘시행착오를 여러 번 겪더라도 될 때까지 하는 팀이라는 것을 느꼈다'는 말에서 단서를 찾을 수 있었습니다.\n\n끝까지 멈추지 않고 한계없이 도전하는 토스의 개발 문화를 표현하기 위해 “No Limit: 풀지 못할 문제는 없다\"는 슬로건을 뽑아낼 수 있었고, 더 나아가 ‘클라이밍'이라는 키 컨셉까지 선정할 수 있었어요. 한계를 규정하지 않고 늘 다음 ‘문제'를 찾아다니고, 처음부터 성공하지 못하더라도 수없이 많은 도전 끝에 결국은 정상을 찍는 클라이밍의 모습이 토스의 개발 문화와도 많이 닮아있었거든요. 재밌게도 클라이밍에서도 이 과정을 개발처럼 ‘문제'라고 부릅니다. ‘개발'이라는 단어를 직접적으로 사용하지 않으면서도 클라이밍과 개발 사이의 교집합을 보다 명확히 짚어주고자 했어요.\n브랜딩과 디테일에 힘쓴 결과\n처음에 키 컨셉 ‘클라이밍'을 잡고 실내 클라이밍에 집중해 키 비주얼을 구현하고 있었는데, 진행하다 보니 시각적 한계가 명확하게 보였습니다. 실내 클라이밍장은 일반적으로 배경 벽과 홀더로 구성되어 있으며, 다양한 크기의 홀더가 일정한 간격으로 배치되어 있는데요. 이러한 요소들을 활용해 SLASH와 연관된 시각적 장치를 만드는 것은 가능하지만, ‘No Limit’이라는 타이틀의 의미를 퇴색시키는 것 같았어요.\n고민을 이어가던 중, 차라리 ‘인간이 자연에 도전하는 야외 클라이밍 컨셉이 더 좋지 않을까?’ 하는 생각이 들었습니다. 높은 암벽을 맨손으로 오르는 야외 클라이밍 영상들을 보니, 불가능할 것 같은 한계에 도전하는 토스 개발자들의 정신과 잘 어우러진다는 확신이 생겼어요.\n그렇게 실내 클라이밍장의 배경 벽보다는 야외 클라이밍이 펼쳐지는 자연 컨셉으로, 일반적인 바위산보다는 슬래시(/) 형태의 비현실적인 형태의 산을 오르는 클라이머를 통해 불가능할 것 같은 한계에 도전하는 토스 개발자들의 정신을 담고자 했습니다.\n\n\n\n오프닝 필름은 SLASH를 처음 접하게 되는 첫인상인 만큼, 사람들에게 강렬하게 남아야 한다고 생각했어요. 후킹되는 비주얼을 만드는 동시에 클라이밍 컨셉과 No Limit 타이틀 심상까지 잘 전달할 수 있어야 하기 때문에 어려운 과제였고요. 담고 싶은 이야기는 너무 많았지만 임팩트와 집중도가 떨어질 것 같아서, 클라이밍 장면에서 슬래시(/)로 이어지는 키 비주얼을 통해 많은 내러티브를 생략하고, 최종 장면에서는 ‘No Limit’ 타이틀을 임팩트있게 담아내기로 했어요.\n짧은 영상으로 큰 임팩트를 주기 위해 초 단위로 디테일하게 고민해 나온 결과물인데, 유튜브 댓글에 ‘행사 영상 하나에도 토스 클래스가 느껴진다', ‘역시 토스는 토스다. 이 영화 언제 개봉해요?’ ‘와, 나 개발자 아닌데 왜 이렇게 마음이 웅장해지는지' 반응들을 보니 의도한 심상이 잘 전달될 것 같았어요.\n오프라인 행사 현장이었던 코엑스의 넓은 공간에도 키 비주얼을 일관성 있게 담아냈어요. 오프닝 필름에서의 경험을 확장하여 심상을 전달하는 한편, 야외 클라이밍이라는 컨셉에서 오는 개방감 있는 느낌으로 채웠습니다.\n코엑스 하면 떠오르는 커다란 ㄷ자형 미디어에는 키 비주얼 바위가 임팩트 있는 사이즈로 굉장히 크게 들어가게 했어요. 영상에서 봤던 말도 안 되는 사이즈의 바위 규모감을 현장에서도 전달하기 위해서였습니다.\n\n웹사이트에서도 차별화된 디자인 톤을 담아내기 위해 노력했는데요. 카드 UI를 각진 돌 형태로 변경하거나, 스크롤 바를 암벽 등반하는 모습으로 커스터마이징하는 등의 장치를 추가해 클라이밍 컨셉을 더욱 강조했어요. 기존에 토스에서 선보이던 것과 다른 톤앤매너로 개발자들에게도 신선한 느낌을 주고자 했고, 업계 트렌드를 주도하는 도전적인 이미지를 전달하고자 했습니다.\n토스에서 진행하는 첫 오프라인 개발 컨퍼런스인 만큼, 키 비주얼과 컨셉이 어느 한 매체에서 툭 튀는 것이 아니라 오프닝 필름, 웹사이트, 오프라인 현장까지 일관된 경험을 하도록 자연스럽게 설계하는 것이 가장 중요했습니다. 그래서 초반 얼개를 짜고 컨셉을 잡는 데에 많은 공을 들였던 거고요.\n행사 이후 진행한 설문조사에서 “온/오프라인으로 접한 SLASH 24 메시지와 비주얼이 컨퍼런스 이미지에 어떤 영향을 주었는지\" 물었는데요. 약 63%의 응답자가 ‘컨퍼런스에 대한 흥미가 높아졌다'고 답변했습니다. 뒤이어 58%의 응답자가 ‘컨퍼런스에 꼭 참여하고 싶어졌다', 33%의 응답자가 ‘영감을 받았다'는 답변을 기록했고요.\n2023년에 많은 사랑을 받았던 2D 애니메이션 같은 컨셉으로 가는 것도 고민했지만, 같은 걸 반복할 수 없다 생각한 보람이 있는 설문 결과였습니다. 어떤 분야든 늘 새롭게 도전하는 토스를 좋아해주시는 분들이 많다는 것을 알고 있으니, 이왕이면 새로운 컨셉으로 새로운 심상을 전달하고 싶었거든요.\n무엇보다 SLASH 24에 참여하는 분들이 기술적인 지식과 경험을 얻어가는 것 이상으로, ‘토스'를 온전히 경험하시길 바랐습니다. 그동안 토스를 모바일과 PC로만 만나셨을 개발자분들이 토스를 실제로 만나는 기회이기 때문에, 완성도 높고 오래도록 기억에 남을 수 있는 경험을 선물하고 싶었고요.\n그 어느 컨퍼런스보다 다채로운 경험을 선사하기 위해\n오프라인 행사 특성 상 단순히 세션을 듣는 것 그 이상의 경험이 필요하다 생각했기 때문에, 다양한 프로그램을 준비했습니다.\n세션과 연계해 더 깊이있는 경험을 제공하기 위해 세션 관련 질의응답 및 기술 관련 고민을 나눌 수 있는 소규모 네트워킹 프로그램을 구성했고, 커리어 고민과 연계해 맞춤 채용 상담을 받을 수 있는 리크루팅존도 운영했어요.\n\n가장 반응이 좋았던 것은 이벤트 월에서 경험할 수 있었던 러닝&인사이트 존인데요. 연사들의 모든 발표 자료를 바인딩해서 가져갈 수 있도록 한 체험 공간이었어요. 개별 카드에는 연사 정보 및 각 세션의 내용이 요약되어 있고, 발표 자료를 pdf로 다운로드받을 수 있는 QR코드도 넣어두었어요. 생각보다 더 많은 분들이 이 존을 경험하기 위해 긴 줄을 서서 기다리는 것을 보고, 컨퍼런스에 오는 분들의 열의가 엄청나다는 생각이 들었습니다.\n\n개발 지식 관련 세션 이외에도 조직 관리, 리더십, 일 잘하는 방법 등을 다룬 스페셜 세션이 진행됐는데요. 다양한 토픽 중 ‘Dear Future CTO’ 세션이 인상 깊었다는 피드백이 많았습니다. 이 세션은 토스뱅크와 토스증권의 Head of Technology 두 분이 참여하셨는데요. 앞으로 리더십 포지션을 꿈꾸는 분들에게 하고 싶은 말을 담아냈습니다.\n세션 하나하나에도 브랜드 가치를 녹여내기 위해 많은 고민을 했었는데요. 특히 이 세션을 기획할 때 가장 중요하게 여겼던 것은, ‘CTO를 커리어패스로서 소개하지 않기'였어요. 이 세션에서는 ‘CTO가 되려면 경력이 얼마나 필요한지' 이야기하지 않았습니다. 오히려 토스의 CTO는 어떤 리더십을 가지고 있고, 어떤 비전을 꿈꾸는지 나누는 것에 집중했어요. 왜냐하면 토스가 일하는 방식을 간접적으로 녹여내 토스팀 개발 문화를 좀더 과감하게 보여주고 싶었기 때문입니다.\n오프라인 컨퍼런스라는 장점을 십분 활용해, 스피커와 청중이 서로 공감하며 이야기를 나눌 수 있는 아고라 형태로 기획했는데 다른 세션과 달리 일방적으로 정보 전달하는 것을 넘어 서로 궁금한 점을 물어보고 답변받을 수 있도록 구성한 덕분에 많은 분들의 기억에 남을 수 있었던 것 같습니다.\n\n\n\n공간적인 측면에서는 평일에 진행되는 행사임을 감안해, 업무를 보셔야 하는 참가자분들의 편의를 고려한 ‘워크스테이션' 존도 마련했어요. 노트북, 스마트폰 등 기기를 충전하거나 잠시 앉아 일을 해야 하는 상황을 미리 배려한 것이었는데요. 시디즈라는 브랜드와의 협업을 통해, 개발자분들 타겟으로 만들어진 퍼포먼스공학 의자를 비치해두었고, 기대 이상으로 많은 분들이 이용해주셨습니다.\n굿즈에서도 일관된 브랜딩 경험을 할 수 있도록 키 비주얼의 여러 요소들을 적절히 적용했어요. 가방에는 오프닝 필름의 인트로에 코딩 텍스트를 이스터 에그로 담았었는데 가방 디자인에 활용했고요. No Limit 타이틀을 메인 오브젝트로 삼아 키링도 제작했어요. 카라비너, 와이어 키링 등 소재도 함께 사용해 클라이밍 컨셉을 제대로 보여주고자 했습니다.\n\nSLASH가 가져온 변화\n4년에 걸쳐 SLASH가 만들어온 브랜드의 크기가 새삼 어마어마하게 느껴집니다. 2021년에는 토스의 개발 문화를 잘 알리기 위해 온라인으로 컨퍼런스를 열었고, 2022년에는 모든 세션의 퀄리티를 업그레이드했고, 2023년에는 세련된 키 비주얼과 컨셉으로 개발자들의 시선을 사로잡았고, 2024년에는 화면 밖으로 나가 1,500여 명의 참가자들과 함께 현장에서 호흡하며 토스의 개발 문화를 널리 전파했죠.\n“토스 SLASH 올해는 언제 해요?” 라는 질문이 꽤 오는 걸 보면, 이제 매년 기다려지는 개발자 컨퍼런스로 자리매김했다 해도 과언이 아닙니다.\n실제로 SLASH는 토스팀에도 큰 영향을 미쳤습니다. 현재 토스팀에 있는 개발자의 60% 이상이 지원할 때 SLASH의 영향을 받았다고 해요. 좋은 동료분들을 모셔오는 데에 제 역할을 톡톡히 해내고 있는 셈이죠. 매년 컨퍼런스를 준비해온 길드는 해를 거듭할 때마다 러닝과 인사이트를 쌓아나가고 있고요.\n다음 SLASH는 또 어떤 모습으로 찾아올지 궁금해지는 가을입니다. 첫 오프라인 컨퍼런스를 성공적으로 치뤄낸 토스팀은, 언제나처럼 더 나은 컨퍼런스 경험을 제공하기 위해 치열하게 고민할 계획입니다. 앞으로도 ‘토스가 토스했다'는 피드백이 유효하기를 기대해주세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWords 차지현 조유현 정다솔 김태성 권영찬 Photo 김세희 Cover & Graphic 이서영",
