This month’s updates includes partial support for Visual Studio 2026 and platform toolset v145, NetBSD platform support, and minor improvements and bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,691 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n38 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n395 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n81 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,100 forks and 26,000 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.10.17 release)\nSupport for v145 platform toolset (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1787, thanks @huangqinjin!).\nAdded support for NetBSD platform (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1789, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1785, thanks @cqundefine!).\nOther minor improvements and bug fixes.\nDocumentation changes\nOver the past month we had minor documentation improvements.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Another year and another CppCon is all wrapped up! Microsoft was pleased to once again be an exhibitor and to have several of our employees present sessions at the conference. Here are my major takeaways from the keynotes, sessions, conversations, and the general vibe.\nAI tooling is finding a footing with the C++ community. The next year is going to see the reliability and usefulness of those tools jump drastically.\nVisual Studio users consistently name the debugger as one of the best features of the product.\nLots of folks are getting excited about the static reflection capabilities in C++26.\nThe week before CppCon, we announced Visual Studio 2026 and Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50, and the conference gave us a great opportunity to let you know what you can expect in the new release and for you to give us your feedback. We highly encourage you to try out the Insiders release and let us know what your experience is like.\nThis is a long post, so here’s a table of contents to help you navigate if you are only interested in specific parts:\nThe Microsoft Booth\nKeynotes\nMicrosoft Sessions\nOther Sessions of Interest\nWrapping It Up\nNow, let’s get into some of the details from the conference.\nThe Microsoft Booth\n     \n \nConference attendees often describe the “hallway track” as a hidden gem of in-person attendance, and as a tool vendor, the exhibition hall serves a similar function: providing a way to broadly understand what the community and our users are looking for from our products. We really do value your feedback, and we appreciate everyone who came by to talk to us or to fill out our feedback survey. We even managed to get in a couple of deeper, private, in-person conversations with users to really dig into what they want from their tools.\nSurvey\nThe survey we conducted ended up with over 170 unique entries, and from those entries, we randomly selected raffle winners for some great LEGO® prizes. Congratulations to the winner!\n        \n\nKeynotes\nConcept-Based Generic Programming – Bjarne Stroustrup\n\nBjarne’s keynote on generic programming with C++ concepts was focused on showing how concepts, which were added in C++20, are one tool in the toolbox for writing code that can reinforce safety and encapsulate differences between types so that code can be written in a way that it doesn’t have to repeatedly handle all the special cases.\nI was particularly fond of the idea of using values as concept parameters to encode into the type system certain expectations about a type, such as maximum object size, which is important in many serialization, caching, and performance optimization scenarios. It’s a much better solution than my existing preference of using static_assert to check object size directly after the type declaration.\nCrafting The Code You Don’t Write: Sculpting Software in an AI World – Daisy Hollman\n\nI didn’t get a chance to see Daisy’s talk live at the conference, but I caught it on the CppCon Video Archive afterwards. Daisy gives a great talk as usual, balancing sharp technical insight and examples that make them relevant to the viewers’ everyday problems. In this case, it was about understanding LLMs and how they work so that you might understand why they give the sorts of completions that they give based on your prompt. Ultimately, they respond to our prompts and the context we provide, and each model will respond differently.\nOne of my favorite things from the talk was the idea that you should think of LLM-based AI assistants “like junior engineers who have read the whole internet.” This is very similar to my description from my Meeting C++ 2023 talk AI Assistants for C++ Developers “as a very eager, over-confident beginner with access to an enormous library and the skills to quickly find and collate information.” Of course, Daisy puts it much more succinctly.\nReflection: C++’s Decade-Defining Rocket Engine – Herb Sutter\n\nI haven’t gotten around to watching Herb’s talk, but I’m looking forward to it soon. Let us know in the comments what you think about it if you were there or after you’ve watched it on YouTube!\nMore Speed & Simplicity: Practical Data-Oriented Design in C++ – Vittorio Romeo\n\nLike with Herb’s talk, I haven’t gotten a chance to watch Vittorio’s keynote. I’m a pretty big fan of data-oriented design so I’m interested in what Vittorio has to say about it. Let us know what you think of his talk in the comments!\nC++: Some Assembly Required – Matt Godbolt\n\nMatt’s closing keynote session was wide-ranging and quite good, as usual. He walked through the different dictionary definitions of assembly and how they applied to C++ and the C++ community, often in surprisingly meaningful ways. Of course, he’s most well known for Compiler Explorer, which lets you view the generated binary code for your C++ code in a variety of assembly language syntaxes. There was content on technical topics like that, but also some rather inspiring and thoughtful content on softer topics as well. Highly recommended viewing.\nMicrosoft Sessions\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025 – David Li and Augustin Popa\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk, Augustin and David go into a lot more detail of the changes that are coming in the new versions of Visual Studio and the MSVC Build Tools. Here are some of the highlights:\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode is now available in Visual Studio. Agents can better understand intent, plan actions, and carry out tasks with less user guidance. You can provide further context to GitHub Copilot by using a custom instructions file to let it know about the preferred conventions and rules for your repo or organization, like how to add unit tests, what style you prefer for comments, and what your priorities are in terms of the quality of your code.\n\nOne of our biggest features this year is Dynamic Debugging, which allows you to deoptimize code on the fly while debugging, making the debugger more useful for projects that are performance sensitive. You will be able to see all your local variables, step reliably, and step into force inline functions. While this feature was inspired by our game dev partners, it is useful for all C++ applications that use debug and release configurations.\n\nFor the MSVC Build Tools, we continue our progress towards C++23 conformance with support for formatting ranges, std::generator, lambda attributes, and more. We also continued to improve the runtime performance of code built with the latest build tools.\nWe fixed 387 C++ issues and implemented 29 C++ feature requests in the past year.\nThere are many UI improvements in Visual Studio 2026, including 11 colorful themes to choose from, an updated Settings experience, and a dockable all-in-one search window.\nOther productivity improvements include automatic word wrap indentation, enhanced line and column navigation, a better Change Signature experience, and the ability to save files with your preferred encoding format.\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents – Alexandra Kemper\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis session highlighted several important improvements and new features, covering extensions like the C/C++ extension, the CMake Tools extension, and GitHub Copilot extension.\nPerformance is one of the major areas of feedback received for the C/C++ extension, and the latest versions have changes that significantly speed up project startup times and reduce the time for source to be parsed and colorized in the editor. Benchmarks show up to 4x faster colorization for large codebases.\nThe CMake Tools extension now supports version 10 of CMake Presets which adds features like adding comments in the JSON presets files via the “$comment” field and additional support for generating a project dependency graph with Graphviz. By popular demand, the CMake Tools extension now has full language service protocol (LSP) support for CMake, as well as the option to exclude specific CMake folders from the project view for easier code navigation.\nGitHub Copilot support in Visual Studio Code is also improving rapidly, with various AI agents available to users today. Visual Studio Code also has great support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables the creation of tools to perform specific actions and exposes those tools to agents. Beyond the agent improvements, Visual Studio Code has also been making GitHub Copilot completions more context-aware and tailored to common C++ coding patterns, and next edit suggestions (NES) can predict the next expected change based on your previous changes and the coding patterns, making changes that span many lines in your codebase much easier.\nAll features covered in the talk are already publicly available; try them out today and let us know what you think!\n\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugger: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code – Eric Brumer\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nEric’s talk covered the use of C++ Dynamic Debugging to effectively debug your optimized code. You don’t have to worry about any more ‘variable was optimized away’ messages, and taking normal debugger actions like step-over and step-into behaves exactly as you would expect it to. It also covered the underlying technical details which make the feature powerful, easy to use, and fast to build.\nLearn more at https://aka.ms/vcdd and https://aka.ms/dynamicdebugging.\n   \nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]! – Inbal Levi\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThe talk introduces the static reflection feature that was voted into the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) in the C++ standard committee, which reviewed the design of the library side of the reflection feature. The session introduced reflection and its transformative potential within our codebases. After a brief history and introduction of utilities from the latest reflection proposal, Inbal explored the possibilities for “Reflection Libraries” and demonstrated potential directions for future improvements.\n  \nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Ben McMorran\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nBen’s talk was all about why the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is needed to address a variety of problems that AI assistants encounter when they want to evolve beyond a simple chat interface. The MCP solves these problems by providing an open and standard way for tools to provide context and actions to AI agents. For me, the most interesting part of the talk was seeing an MCP agent get implemented and seeing just how simple, yet powerful, they can be. They really form a major backbone of a successful agentic AI system.\n\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI – Ion Todirel\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIon’s talk was about practical advice for using AI tools, specifically for embedded and systems programming tasks. The advice offered was based on real-world problems and attempts to solve them using the AI tools that exist today. I’d say that a lot of the points made are relevant to tasks outside of that domain as well, and a key takeaway I had was that if at first your prompt doesn’t succeed, prompt again. Eventually, with enough experience (and advice) you’ll improve your prompts to get the most effective results and save you time when using an AI assistant.\n    \nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial – Michael Price\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis was my talk and I had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it. I walk through some of the key things that a C++ developer needs to know to get started with game development, focusing on Blender, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio 2026. The key takeaway for this talk is that while getting into game development can be intimidating due to unfamiliar tools and techniques, modern tools really lower the barrier. You can make simple 3D game assets in just a few minutes and easily import them into your project, and making your existing C++ code available to Unreal Engine is actually not that hard.\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop – Victor Ciura\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nHybrid C++/Rust codebases are quickly becoming more common – at Microsoft and everywhere in the industry. Having seamless interop between the C++ and Rust components is essential for the success of this symbiosis. There are many challenges in this process, but people found various ways to make things work – from dealing with ABI compatibility and platform/toolchain guarantees, to going down to C and FFI, to various techniques and tools for generating glue-code between the two languages. Many of the explored solutions so far by the community fail to deliver on all the needed requirements, swinging the wide range between performant and ergonomic. Victor highlighted all the interop challenges, some of the good solutions out there, and teased out the avenues at the forefront of this pursuit.\n\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Bharat Kumar\n\nC++ remains a foundational language for high-performance applications, but its lack of inherent memory safety and prevalence of undefined behaviors pose serious challenges. Rewriting the vast corpus of existing C++ code into a memory-safe language isn’t feasible in the short term, especially for large-scale projects like Microsoft Edge, which is built atop Chromium’s predominantly C++ codebase. Fortunately, meaningful safety improvements are possible without a full rewrite. Chandranath and Bharat explore how the Edge team systematically addresses safety across four core dimensions: bounds checking, lifetime management, initialization correctness, and type safety. These efforts are grounded in real-world engineering constraints and aim to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities while preserving performance. They also delve into complementary initiatives targeting thread safety, definition safety, and the mitigation of other undefined behaviors. By combining targeted refactoring, static analysis, and safer abstractions, the Microsoft Edge team is charting a pragmatic path toward more resilient C++ code. The session offers insights into scalable safety strategies that can be adopted across large legacy codebases.\n    \nBack to Basics: Code Review – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk Chandranath and Kathleen examined examples of common C++ coding mistakes the Microsoft Edge team has come across when reviewing code and shared practical strategies to avoid them. They explored best practices for variable scoping, iteration, function and class design, and useful STL functions and algorithms. The talk also provided clang-tidy checks and warnings to use to catch these common issues.\nC++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects – Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nPrithvi and Kathleen’s session focused on techniques to prevent copying or moving objects in favor of in-place construction. It included many code examples with clang-tidy checks and warnings you can use to point out the potential areas of improvement in your own code. They highlighted guidelines such as passing non-trivial objects by reference, using view types, leveraging in-place constructors, best practices for containers like using emplace and transparent comparators, and finally eliminating runtime cost by moving computation to compile time.\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second – Daniel Lemire (Université du Québec) and Francisco Geiman Thiesen (Microsoft)\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIt is fair to say that reflection was one of the latest additions to the library that has attracted the most attention and it was a subject discussed in many of the talks in this edition of CppCon.\nIn this talk Daniel and Francisco discussed their experience integrating the latest C++26 reflection proposal into the open source simdjson library. A few interesting takeaways from the talk:\nReflection allows the user to deserialize/serialize their types without having to write any boilerplate code; something that previously took a LOT of boilerplate.\nYou can get best-in-class performance by using reflection together with several optimizations, even when extending a library that was designed only with deserialization in mind.\nFor now this is an experimental feature already available in the library. It should gain more traction whenever the latest reflection proposal is added to MSVC, GCC, and\nHandling JSON is a poster-child use case for reflection and they went above and beyond to integrate that into the simdjson library, while still following its design principles and guaranteeing the absolute best performance.\nSlides are publicly available in: C++26 Reflection for JSON Serialization – A Practical Journey\n\nOther Sessions of Interest\nIn addition to the keynotes and our own Microsoft sessions, here are some sessions I managed to catch during my very busy week that I thought were interesting.\nPanel: What We Learned About AI Tools For C++ Engineers – Guy Davidson, Daisy Hollman, Inbal Levi, Jason Turner, Matt Godbolt, Michael Wong\nThe conference hosted a panel on the topic of AI for C++ Engineers, on which senior members of the C++ training, tooling, and authoring community offered their experience of using these tools, how they have improved their workflow, where the shortcomings are, and what the ideal future will hold. They are also keen to hear the experiences of other engineers who have experimented with AI tools.\nCommittee Fireside Chat – Herb Sutter, Jeff Garland, Andrei Alexandrescu, Bjarne Stroustrup, Gabriel Dos Reis, Inbal Levi, Guy Davidson, Timur Doumler, Barry Revzin, Nina Ranns, Khalil Estell, Vittorio Romeo, Ruslan Arutyunyan, Daisy Hollman\nIf you’d like to learn more about C++26’s additions of static reflection, async model (std::execution), contracts, and significant safety improvements, this is the session for you.\nWrapping It Up\nCongrats, you made it to the end! Thanks for reading through all the way. Be sure to come back and check out the Microsoft C++ blog (this one!) over the coming weeks as we make new announcements for Visual Studio 2026 and all of our other C++ products, and we hope to see you all next September in Aurora!\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 getting closer to General Availability (GA), we want to share with you how you can upgrade your projects from your current versions of Visual Studio and the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools to the latest versions. The new IDE ships with the v145 platform toolset for MSBuild C++ projects and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. In this post, I will walk you through the process step-by-step, while explaining some of the features available to you to make the transition as painless as possible. Overall, our goal is to help you get current and stay current.\nStep 1: Try out Visual Studio 2026\nAs of September 9, 2025, you can install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Once the stable release of Visual Studio 2026 ships, you will be able to download it from the same link. You can choose between Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise as before. Visual Studio instances can be installed side-by-side from the Visual Studio Installer application, so you can keep your current version of Visual Studio while exploring 2026.\nIf you are not ready to fully migrate yet, you can load your existing Visual Studio MSBuild (.sln/.vcxproj) projects in Visual Studio 2026 and retain compatibility with your existing copy of Visual Studio without having to upgrade the project files.\nStep 2: Migrate to Visual Studio 2026, stay on existing MSVC Build Tools\nIf you’re satisfied with your Visual Studio 2026 experience and are ready to use it daily, you can do so without needing to use the latest MSVC Build Tools. The installer for Visual Studio 2026 gives you the ability to install your existing C++ build tools going back as far as Visual Studio 2015. You can select multiple components/versions to include for your Visual Studio instance.\n\nHowever, there is an even easier way to get started in Visual Studio 2026 and stay on your existing MSVC toolset version.\nInstall missing tools with Visual Studio setup assistant\nYou can use the new setup assistant experience to install missing tools and/or retarget any projects that are ready to move forward. You do not have to install and upgrade everything all at once.\n\nThis assistant will appear by default when you load your solution for the first time, or you can right-click the solution and select Retarget solution. To stay on a project’s existing toolset version and install any missing tools, choose the “Install missing Platform Toolset…” option. You can also click the Install All button to instantly set all the dropdowns to that option. If you already have the correct toolset version installed and want to stay on it, no action needs to be taken.\nYou will also see options to retarget your projects. You can go back and select these later when you are ready to move your projects and toolset version forward to the latest. Retargeting will update the Windows SDK Version, Platform Toolset, and MSVC Build Tools Version project properties. You may select what to do for each project or retarget all of them at once with the Retarget all button.\nFundamentally, the setup assistant allows you to upgrade gradually at your own pace.\nStep 3: Upgrade MSVC Build Tools to version 14.50\nWhen you decide it’s the right time to upgrade and explore the latest MSVC toolset, the process is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Visual Studio aims to support you to get current and stay current on the latest tools.\nWhy you should upgrade your C++ build tools\nBy upgrading, you get access to new C++ language updates and bug fixes in the Microsoft C++ compiler and standard library. In addition, if you upgrade, you get runtime performance improvements:\nUp to +6%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nRetarget your projects with the setup assistant\nAs mentioned previously, the setup assistant can help you retarget your projects, so they build with the latest MSVC Build Tools.\n\nBelow is a quick video demonstration of the setup assistant in action to install missing tools and retarget projects.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4\n\nThere are the new MSVC components in the Visual Studio Installer.\n\nComponents marked as “Latest” will be updated to the latest available version when you update the IDE, while components with a major and minor version number will remain on that minor version and only receive servicing updates while in support.\nC++ binary compatibility for step-by-step upgrades\nWe’re announcing that MSVC Build Tools version 14.50 preserves binary compatibility with any code built with MSVC tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 or later. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and external dependencies all at once. The Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable, which ships the Visual C++ v14 Runtime, also continues to maintain this binary compatibility. Note: there are a few restrictions with the binary compatibility experience, which you should review in our documentation.\nAs a result of this binary compatibility, you can upgrade your code step-by-step, component by component. You can also update your main application while your external dependencies remain on an older version. For your third party open-source dependencies, you can use the vcpkg package manager to rebuild them with the latest toolset or any previous MSVC toolset shipping in Visual Studio 2026.\nStep 4: Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++\nBut wait, there’s more! GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ helps you migrate your C++ projects to the latest MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, you may need to make additional source code or project system changes due to deprecations or fixes in the newer toolset. Copilot will help you iterate through these changes until all warnings and errors are resolved. GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is coming soon to Visual Studio 2026 in Private Preview. Check out our announcement post for more information and join the waitlist.\nGet Current, Stay Current\nOur goal is for you to have a painless upgrade to Visual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At Meta, we use invisible watermarking for a variety of content provenance use cases on our platforms.\nInvisible watermarking serves a number of use cases, including detecting AI-generated videos, verifying who posted a video first, and identifying the source and tools used to create a video.\nWe’re sharing how we overcame the challenges of scaling invisible watermarking, including how we built a CPU-based solution that offers comparable performance to GPUs, but with better operational efficiency.\nInvisible watermarking is a powerful media-processing technique that allows us to embed a signal into media in a way that’s imperceptible to humans but detectable by software. This technology offers a robust solution for content provenance tagging (an indication of where the content came from), enabling the identification and tracking of content to support various use cases. At its core, invisible watermarking works by subtly modifying pixel values in images, waveforms in audio, or text tokens generated by large language models (LLMs) to embed a small amount of data. The design of watermarking systems adds necessary redundancy; this ensures the embedded identification remains persistent through transcodes and editing, unlike metadata tags that can be lost.\nBringing an invisible watermarking solution to production at scale presents many challenges. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how we overcame challenges with deployment environments, bitrate increases, and visual quality regressions to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nSome Helpful Definitions\nDigital watermarking, steganography, and invisible watermarking are related concepts, but it’s important to understand their differences:\nFeature\nDigital Watermarking\nSteganography\nInvisible Watermarking\n\n\nPurpose\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\nSecret communication\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\n\n\nVisibility\nVisible or invisible\nInvisible\nInvisible\n\n\nRobustness\nagainst content modifications\nMedium to high\nUsually low\nHigh (survives edits)\n\n\nPayload / Message  Capacity\nMedium (varies)\nVaries\nMedium (e.g., >64 bits)\n\n\nComputational Cost\nLow (visible) to high (invisible)\nVaries\nHigh (advanced ML models)\n\n\n\n\nThe Need for Robust Content Tagging\nIn today’s digital landscape, where content is constantly shared, remixed, and even AI-generated, important questions arise:\nWho Published the Video First?\nIn the photos in Figure 1, you can see two different user names, but there’s no visual indicator of who uploaded this image first. Invisible watermarking can help identify the first time a video was uploaded.\nFigure 1: Screenshots of what appear to be the same video uploaded by two users on Instagram Reels.\nIs It Even a Real Image?\nWith increasingly realistic generative AI (GenAI) videos, distinguishing between real and AI-generated content is increasingly challenging. Invisible watermarking can be used to infer if content such as in Figure 2 is AI-generated.\nFigure 2: An AI-generated image.\nWhat Camera Was Used? \nWhen encountering a compelling image or video like the one in Figure 3, people often wonder about the source and tools used for creation. Invisible watermarking can infer this information directly.\nFigure 3: A screenshot from a video captured with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nTraditional methods such as visual watermarks (which can be distracting) or metadata tags (which can be lost if a video is edited or re-encoded) do not address these challenges adequately and robustly. Due to its persistence and imperceptibility, invisible watermarking presents a superior alternative.\nThe Scaling Journey: From GPUs to CPUs\nEarlier digital watermarking research (starting in the 1990s) employed digital signal-processing techniques (such as DCT and DWT) to modify an image’s spectral properties to hide imperceptible information. Although these methods proved highly effective for static images and were considered a “solved problem,” they are not adequately robust against the various types of geometric transformations and filtering we see in social media and other real-world applications. \nToday’s state-of-the-art solutions (such as VideoSeal) use machine-learning (ML) techniques providing significantly improved robustness against the type of edits seen in social media. However, the application of solutions to the video problem domain (i.e., frame-by-frame watermarking) may be prohibitively computationally expensive without the necessary inference optimizations. \nGPUs may seem an obvious solution for deploying ML-based video watermarking solutions. However, most types of GPU hardware are specialized for the training and inference of large-scale models (such as LLMs and diffusion models). They have partial or no support for video transcoding (compression and decompression). Enabling invisible watermarking for videos has therefore posed unique challenges for our existing video-processing software (FFmpeg) and hardware stack (GPUs without video-transcoding capabilities or other custom accelerators for video processing without efficient ML-model inference capabilities). \nGPU Optimization Attempts and the Shift to CPUs\nOur embedding architecture uses FFmpeg with a custom filter to compute and apply invisible watermark masks to the videos. The filter acts as a reusable block that can be added easily to existing video processing pipelines. Migrating to a more optimal inference service for warmed-up models would mean sacrificing the flexibility of our FFmpeg filter, so for our application that was not an option.\nProfiling our invisible watermarking filter revealed low GPU utilization. We implemented frame batching and threading in the filter, but these efforts yielded no significant improvements to latency or utilization. GPUs with hardware video encoders and decoders can more easily reach high throughput, but the GPUs available for our service lack video encoders, requiring frames to be sent back to the CPU for encoding. Here a software video encoder can end up being a major bottleneck for pipelines using low-complexity ML models on a GPU.\nSpecifically, we encountered three primary bottlenecks:\nData transfer overhead: Transferring high-resolution input video frames back and forth between CPUs and multiple GPUs posed challenges to thread and memory optimizations, yielding suboptimal GPU utilization. \nInference latency: Processing multiple invisible watermarking requests across multiple GPUs in parallel on the same host led to a dramatic increase in inference latency.\nModel loading time: Despite the model’s small size, loading the model consumed a significant portion of the total processing time. Relying on FFmpeg prevented us from using warmed-up, pre-loaded models on the GPUs.\nRecognizing these limitations, we began investigating CPU-only inference. The embedder’s neural network architecture is more favorable to GPUs, and initial benchmarks showed that end-to-end (E2E) performance was more than two times slower on CPUs. By adjusting threading parameters for the encoder, decoder, and PyTorch, and optimizing sampling parameters used by the invisible watermarking filter, we saw significant improvements. \nUltimately, with properly tuned threading and embedding parameters, the E2E latency for running invisible watermarking on a CPU in a single process was within 5% of GPU performance. Crucially, we could run multiple FFmpeg processes in parallel on CPUs without increased latency. This breakthrough allowed us to calculate the capacity needed and achieve a more operationally efficient solution compared to a GPU-based solution.\nTo validate our CPU solution’s scalability in a distributed system, we conducted comprehensive load tests. Given a pool of CPU workers, we generated test traffic at increasing request rates to identify the peak performance point before per-request latency began to rise. For comparison, we used the same parameters with GPU inference on a pool of GPU workers with similar capabilities. The results confirmed that our CPU solution could perform at scale, comparable to our local test findings. This achievement allowed us to provision the required capacity with greater operational efficiency compared to a GPU-based approach.\nOptimization Considerations and Trade-offs\nDeploying invisible watermarking at scale presented several optimization challenges, primarily involving trade-offs between four metrics:\nLatency: The speed at which the watermarking process occurs\nWatermark detection bit-accuracy: The accuracy of detecting embedded watermarks\nVisual quality: Ensuring the embedded watermark is imperceptible to the human eye\nCompression efficiency (measured by BD-Rate): Ensuring the embedded watermark does not significantly increase bitrate\nOptimizing for one metric may negatively impact others. For example, a stronger watermark for higher bit accuracy might lead to visible artifacts and increased bitrate. We can’t create a perfectly optimal solution for all four metrics si\nManaging BD-Rate Impact\nInvisible watermarking, while imperceptible, introduces increased entropy, which can lead to a higher bitrate for video encoders. Our initial implementation showed a BD-Rate regression of around 20%, meaning users would need more bandwidth to watch a watermarked video. To mitigate this, we devised a novel frame-selection method for watermarking so that the BD-Rate impact is largely reduced while increasing visual quality and minimally impacting watermark bit detection accuracy.\nAddressing Regressions in Visual Quality \nWe need to ensure the “invisible” watermark remains truly invisible. We initially observed noticeable visual artifacts despite high-quality metric scores (VMAF and SSIM).\nWe addressed the visual-quality evaluations by implementing a custom post-processing technique and iterating through different embedding settings through crowdsourced manual inspections. This subjective evaluation was crucial for unblocking us, as traditional visual quality metrics proved insufficient for detecting the type of artifact an invisible watermark can at times introduce. As we tuned the algorithm for human invisibility, we closely monitored the bit accuracy impact to achieve an optimal balance between visual quality and detection accuracy.\nLearnings and the Road Ahead\nOur journey to deploy a scalable, invisible watermarking solution provided valuable insights:\nWith proper optimizations, CPU-only pipelines can reach performances comparable to GPU pipelines for specific use cases at much lower cost. Contrary to our initial assumptions, with the right optimizations CPUs offered us a more operationally efficient and scalable solution for our invisible-watermarking system. While GPUs are still faster for the invisible watermark model inference, we were able to use optimizations to bring down the overall compute and latency with the CPU fleet.\nTraditional video quality scores are insufficient for invisible watermarking: We learned that metrics like VMAF and SSIM do not fully capture the perceptual quality issues introduced by invisible watermarking, necessitating manual inspection. More research is needed to develop a metric to programmatically detect the visual-quality loss incurred by invisible watermarking.\nThe quality bar for production use is high: Watermarking techniques may not directly apply to real-world use cases due to the impact on BD-Rate and downstream video compression. We needed to expand upon the literature to keep BD-Rate impacts low while maintaining excellent bit accuracy for detection.\nWe successfully shipped a scalable watermarking solution with excellent latency, visual quality, detection bit accuracy, and a minimal BD-Rate impact.\nAs our North Star goal, we aim to continue to improve the precision and copy-detection recall with invisible watermark detection. This will involve further tuning of model parameters, pre- and post-processing steps, and video encoder settings. Ultimately, we envision invisible watermarking as a lightweight “filter block” that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of video use cases without product-specific tweaks, providing minimal impact on the user experience while offering robust content provenance.\nThe post Video Invisible Watermarking at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This edition is packed with insightful, practical, and curiosity-fueling reads. From hands-on advice to thought-provoking pieces, we’ve gathered a nice selection of stories that will help you stay sharp and inspired in the tech world.\nWe’re also happy to have Josh Long as our featured content author this month! Expect some top-notch insights and a good dose of Spring.\nSo, grab your coffee and dive in – there’s plenty worth reading inside!\nFeatured Content\nJosh Long \nJosh Long works on the Spring team as its number one fan. You can find more of his content – blogs, Youtube content, podcasts, etc. – on his website.\nHi, Spring fans! Spring Boot 4 comes out in November 2025! With this in mind, lLet’s at least look at some of my favorite features together. Jakarta EE 11 is the new baseline. We’ve retained a Java 17 baseline but strongly encourage a Java 25 posture whenever possible. We’ve moved the baseline to GraalVM 25 for native images and updated our Kotlin support to Kotlin 2.2. The new generation of projects assumes the new Jackson 3. We’ve introduced JSpecify nullability annotations across the portfolio to finally eliminate Tony Hoare’s $1 billion dollar mistake – null references. Spring Boot 4 has decomposed the autoconfiguration artifact into smaller, more modular autoconfigurations.\nOne of my favorite new features is API versioning. Here’s a Spring MVC controller with two endpoints, each designated a particular version, the default version of which we can specify with spring.mvc.apiversion.default=1.1.\n@RestController\n\nclass DogsController {\n\n    ...\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\",version=\"1.0\")\n\n    Collection<Map<String, Object>> dogsClassic() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\", version = \"1.1\")\n\n    Collection<Dog> dogs() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\nI also love the new easy-mode declarative HTTP clients. Let’s build a client to talk to the Cat Facts API and then activate it using @ImportHttpServices(CatFacts.class):\nrecord CatFact(@JsonProperty(\"fact_number\") int factNumber, String fact) { }\n\nrecord CatFactsResponse(Collection<CatFact> facts) { }\n\ninterface CatFacts {\n\n    @GetExchange(\"https://www.catfacts.net/api\")\n\n    CatFactsResponse facts();\n\n}\nWe built a simple client, and it should work, but what if the service is down? In this case, we can enable resilient methods with Spring’s new @EnableResilientMethods annotation. This gives us two new features: @ConcurrencyLimit and @Retryable (and the related RetryTemplate).\n...\n\n    @ConcurrencyLimit(10)\n\n    @Retryable(maxAttempts = 4, includes = BadException.class)\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/facts\")\n\n    Collection<CatFact> facts()  throws Exception {\n\n        ...\n\n    }\n\n    ...\n    \nSpring Framework 7 brings BeanRegistrar configuration, which is a more dynamic alternative to Java configuration that can be used in conjunction with Java configuration and component scanning with the usual @Import annotation.\nclass MyBeanRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class, spec -> spec\n\n                .description(\"description\")\n\n                .supplier(supplierContext -> new Runner(\n\n                        supplierContext.bean(DogRepository.class), supplierContext.beanProvider(CatFacts.class)\n\n                        .getIfUnique())\n\n                ));\n\n    }\n\n}\nSpring Security brings with it a lot of nice new features. Two of my favorites are multi-factor auth, allowing you to require that multiple authentication factors be present, and Customizer<HttpSecurity> beans for additive changes to the HttpSecurity configuration.\n@EnableGlobalMultiFactorAuthentication(\n\n    authorities = { FactorGrantedAuthority.PASSWORD_AUTHORITY, FactorGrantedAuthority.OTT_AUTHORITY })\n\n@Configuration\n\nclass SecurityConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n\n    Customizer<HttpSecurity> httpSecurityCustomizer() {\n\n        return httpSecurity -> httpSecurity\n\n                .webAuthn(w -> ... )\n\n                .oneTimeTokenLogin(ott -> ... );\n\n    }\n\n}\nThe code is here for your reference.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the third post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nAll parts in the series:\nGetting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nEvaluating Kotlin in Real Projects\nGrowing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company\nSpread the Word: Win the Hearts and Minds of your Fellow Developers\nBy now, you have a core team convinced of Kotlin’s benefits. Now comes the critical phase: How do you expand adoption? \nKey in this phase is to win the hearts and minds of skeptical Java developers. Hard and soft factors can make the difference here:\nHard factors: the code\nLet the code speak\nSoft factors: support and connect developers\nFacilitate easy onboarding\nOffer self-study material\nEstablish an in-house Kotlin community\nBe patient…\nLet the code speak\nDouble down on the experience you gained by (re-)writing an application in Kotlin and show the benefits in a tangible, accessible way:\nShow, don’t tell: present the gained conciseness of Kotlin by comparing Java with Kotlin snippets. \nZoom out to focus on the overarching paradigms: Kotlin is not just different from Java: Kotlin is built on the foundation of safety, conciseness for maximal readability and maintainability, functions as a first-class citizen, and extensibility, which together solve fundamental shortcomings of Java, while still being fully interoperable with the Java ecosystem.\nHere are some tangible examples:\n1. Null-safety: No more billion-dollar mistakes \nJava\n//This is why we have the billion-dollar mistake (not only in Java…)\nBooking booking = null; //🤨 This is allowed but causes:\nbooking.destination; //Runtime error 😱\n\nOptional<Booking> booking = null; //Optionals aren’t safe from null either: 🤨\nbooking.map(Destination::destination); //Runtime error 😱\nJava has added some null-safety features over time, like Optional and Annotations (@NotNull etc.), but it has failed to solve this fundamental problem. Additionally, project Valhalla (Null-Restricted and Nullable types) will not introduce null-safety to Java, but rather provide more options to choose from. \nKotlin\n//Important to realize that null is very restricted in Kotlin:\nval booking:Booking? = null //…null can only be assigned to Nullable types ✅ \nval booking:Booking = null //null assigned to a Non-nullable types yields a Compilation error 😃 \n\nbooking.destination //unsafely accessing a nullable type directly causes a Compilation error 😃\nbooking?.destination //only safe access is possible  ✅\nThe great thing about Kotlin’s null-safety is that it is not only safe, but also offers great usability. A classic example of “have your cake and eat it, too”:\nSay we have this Domain:\nKotlin\ndata class Booking(val destination:Destination? = null)\ndata class Destination(val hotel:Hotel? = null)\ndata class Hotel(val name:String, val stars:Int? = null)\nJava\npublic record Booking(Optional<Destination> destination) {\n\n   public Booking() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Booking(Destination destination) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(destination));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Destination(Optional<Hotel> hotel) {\n\n   public Destination() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Destination(Hotel hotel) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(hotel));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Hotel(String name, Optional<Integer> stars) {\n\n   public Hotel(String name) {\n\n       this(name, Optional.empty());\n\n   }\n\n   public Hotel(String name, Integer stars) {\n       this(name, Optional.ofNullable(stars));\n   }\n}\nConstructing objects\nJava\n//Because Optional is a wrapper, the number of nested objects grows, which doesn’t help readability\nfinal Optional<Booking> booking = Optional.of(new Booking(\n      Optional.of(new Destination(Optional.of(\n            new Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5))))));\nKotlin\n//Since nullability is part of the type system, no wrapper is needed: The required type or null can be used. \nval booking:Booking? = Booking(Destination(Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5)))\nTraversing nested objects\nJava\n//traversing a graph of Optionals requires extensive unwrapping\nfinal var stars = \"*\".repeat(booking\n                          .flatMap(Booking::getDestination)\n                          .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n                          .map(Hotel::getStars).orElse(0)); //-> \"*****\"\nKotlin\n//Easily traverse a graph of nullable types with: ‘?’, use  ?: for the ‘else’ case.\nval stars = \"*\".repeat(booking?.destination?.hotel?.stars ?: 0) //-> \"*****\"\nUnwrap nested object\nJava\n//extensive unwrapping is also needed for printing a leaf \nbooking.getDestination()\n       .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n       .map(Hotel::getName)\n       .map(String::toUpperCase)\n         .ifPresent(System.out::println);\nKotlin\n//In Kotlin we have two elegant options:\n//1. we can again traverse the graph with ‘?’\nbooking?.destination?.hotel.?name?.uppercase()?.also(::println)\n\n//2. We can make use of Kotlin’s smart-cast feature\nif(booking?.destination?.hotel != null) {\n   //The compiler has checked that all the elements in the object graph are not null, so we can access the elements as if they were non-nullable types\n   println(booking.destination.hotel.uppercase())\n}\nThe lack of null-safety support in Java is a key pain-point for developers, leading to defensive programming, different nullability constructs (or none at all), including increased verbosity. Moreover, NullPointerExceptions are responsible for roughly one-third of application crashes (The JetBrains Blog). Kotlin’s compile-time null checking prevents these runtime failures entirely. That’s why, still today, Null-safety is the primary driver for migration to Kotlin.\n2. Collections are your friend, not your enemy\nThe creator of Spring, Rod Johnson, stated in a recent interview that it was not Nullable-types that made him try out Kotlin, but the overly complicated Java Streams API: Creator of Spring: No desire to write Java. \nThe following example depicts the various reasons why the Java Streams API is so horribly complicated and how Kotlin solves all of the issues:\nJava\npublic record Product(String name, int... ratings){}\nList<Product> products = List.of(\n  new Product(\"gadget\", 9, 8, 7), \n  new Product(\"goody\", 10, 9)\n);\n\nMap<String, Integer> maxRatingsPerProduct =\n\n   //🤨 1. Stream introduces indirection\n   products.stream()\n     //🤨 1. Always to and from Stream conversion\n      .collect(\n        //🤨 2. Lacks extension methods, so wrappers are required\n        Collectors.groupingBy(\n           Product::name,\n            //🤨 2. Again…\n           Collectors.mapping( groupedProducts ->\n                //🤨 3. (too) low-level types, arrays, and primitives cause extra complexity\n                //🤨 4. No API on Array, always wrap in stream \n               Arrays.stream(groupedProducts.ratings())\n                   .max()\n                      //🤨 5. Extra verbosity due to Optional\n                      .orElse(0.0),\n               //🤨 6. No named arguments: what does this do?\n                Collectors.reducing(0, Integer::max)\n              )\n            ));\nKotlin\n//😃 rich and uniform Collection API - even on Java collections - due to extension methods\nval maxRatingsPerProduct = products.\n      .groupBy { it.name }\n      .mapValues { (_, groupedProducts) -> //😃 destructuring for semantic precision\n            //😃 built-in nullability support, and the same API for \n            //arrays like other Collections\n            groupedProducts.flatMap { it.ratings }\n                  .maxOrNull() ?: 0 \n            }\n      }\nDue to Kotlin’s uniform Collection framework, converting between different collection types is very straightforward:\nJava\nint[] numbers = {1, 3, 3, 5, 2};\n\nSet<Integer> unique = Arrays.stream(numbers).boxed().collect(Collectors.toSet());\n\nMap<Integer, Boolean> evenOrOdd = unique.stream()\n       .collect(Collectors.toMap(\n               n -> n,\n               n -> n % 2 == 0));\nKotlin\nval numbers = arrayOf(1, 3, 3, 5, 2)\n\nval unique: Set<Int> = numbers.toSet() //😃 simply call to<Collection> to do the conversion\n\nval evenOrOdd: Map<Int, Boolean> = unique.associateWith { it % 2 == 0 }\nNet effect:\nFeature-rich, intuitive Collection API: pipelines read left-to-right like English, not inside nested collector calls.\nLess boilerplate and complexity: no Collectors.groupingBy, no Stream, no Optional, no Arrays.stream.\nOne mental model: whether you start with a List, Set, Array, or primitive array, you reach for the same collection operators.\nPerformance without pain: the compiler inserts boxing/unboxing only where unavoidable; you write normal code.\n​​Null-safety integrated: Collection API fully supports nullability with various helpers often suffixed with orNull(...).\nSeamless Java-interop with idiomatic wrappers: Due to extension methods, you get the “best of both worlds” – feature-rich Collections on top of Java collections.\nPut simply, Kotlin lifts the everyday collection tasks – filtering, mapping, grouping etc. – into first-class, composable functions, so you express what you want, not the ceremony of how to get there.\n3. No more checked Exceptions, yet safer code in Kotlin\nJava is one of the only languages that still supports checked Exceptions. Though initially implemented as a safety feature, they have not lived up to their promise. Their verbosity, pointless catch blocks that do nothing or rethrow as an Exception as a RuntimeException, and their misalignment with lambdas are a few reasons why they get in the way rather than making your code safer.\nKotlin follows the proven paradigm used by almost all other programming languages –C#, Python, Scala, Rust, and Go – of using exceptions only for unrecoverable situations.\nThe following examples highlight the obstacles that checked Exceptions introduce into your code, without adding any safety:\nJava\npublic String downloadAndGetLargestFile(List<String> urls) {\n   List<String> contents = urls.stream().map(urlStr -> {\n               Optional<URL> optional;\n               try {\n                   optional = Optional.of(new URI(urlStr).toURL());\n                   //🤨 Within lambdas checked exceptions are not supported and must always be caught...\n               } catch (URISyntaxException | MalformedURLException e) {\n                   optional = Optional.empty();\n               }\n               return optional;\n           }).filter(Optional::isPresent)       //Quite a mouthful to get rid of the Optional...\n           .map(Optional::get)\n           .map(url -> {\n               try (InputStream is = url.openStream()) {\n                   return new String(is.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n               } catch (IOException e) {\n                   //🤨… or re-thrown, which is annoying, I don’t really care about IOE\n                   throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);\n               }\n           }).toList();\n   //🤨 An empty List results in a NoSuchElementException, so why is it not checked? The chance that the List is empty is as high as the other two cases above...\n   return Collections.max(contents);\n}\nKotlin\n//😃 safe return type\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List<String>): String? =\n   urls.mapNotNull {    //😃 convenient utility methods to rid of null\n       //😃 try catch is possible, yet runCatching is an elegant way to convert an exception to null\n       runCatching { URI(it).toURL() }.getOrNull()\n   }.maxOfOrNull{  //😃 safe way to retrieve the max value\n       it.openStream().use{ it.reader().readText() }  //😃 convenient extension methods to make java.io streams fluent\n   }\n4. Functions as first-class citizens\nKotlin treats functions as first-class citizens, which may raise questions if you’re coming from Java: What does that mean, and why does it matter?\nThe key difference lies in Java’s limited approach – its functional capabilities focus mostly on the call-site via lambdas, while the declaration-side remains tied to verbose and less intuitive functional interfaces. In Kotlin, you can define, pass, return, and compose functions without any boilerplate, making functional programming far more expressive and natural.\nJava\npublic void doWithImage(\n      URL url, \n      //🤨 Function interfaces introduce an indirection: because we don’t see the signature of a Function we don’t know what a  BiConsumer does, unless we look it up\n      BiConsumer<String, BufferedImage> f) throws IOException {\n        f.accept(url.getFile(), ImageIO.read(url));\n}\n\n//🤨 Same here\npublic void debug(Supplier<String> f) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled()) {\n      logger.debug(\"Debug: \" + f.get());\n   }\n}\n\n//🤨 calling no-argument lambdas is verbose\ndebug(() -> \"expensive concat\".repeat(1000));\nKotlin\nfun doWithImage(\n   url: URL,\n  //😃 Kotlin has a syntax for declaring functions: from the signature, we see what goes in and what goes out \n   f:(String, BufferedImage) -> Unit) = \n      f(url.file, ImageIO.read(url))\n\n  //😃 same here: nothing goes in, a String goes out\nfun debug(msg: () -> String) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled) {\n            logger.debug(msg())\n   }\n}\n\n//😃 convenient syntax to pass a lambda: {<lambda body>}\ndebug{\"expensive concat\".repeat(1000)}\nKotlin provides a clear and concise syntax for declaring functions – just from the signature, you can immediately see what goes in and what comes out, without having to navigate to an external functional interface. \nJava “leaks” its functional programming features through a large set of java.util.function.* interfaces with verbose and complex signatures, which often makes functional programming cumbersome to use. Kotlin, by contrast, treats functions as first-class citizens: these interfaces remain hidden from the developer, yet remain fully interoperable with Java’s approach:\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, using functions in Kotlin is significantly more straightforward and intuitive, which lowers the threshold considerably for leveraging this powerful programming concept in your own code. \n5. Headache-free concurrency with coroutines\nIf you need high throughput, parallel processing within a single request, or streaming, the only option you have in Java is a reactive library, like Reactor and RxJava, available in frameworks like Spring WebFlux, Vert.X, Quarkus etc.\nThe problem with these libraries is that they are notoriously complicated, forcing you into functional programming. As such, they have a steep learning curve, yet it is very easy to make errors that can have dire consequences when the application is under load. That’s most probably why reactive programming never became mainstream. \nNote: VirtualThreads are not a replacement for reactive libraries, even though there is some overlap. VirtualThreads offer non-blocking I/O, but do not provide features such as parallel processing or reactive streams. Structured concurrency and Scoped Values will also enable parallel processing once the major frameworks have support for it. For reactive streams, you will always have to rely on a reactive library.\n\r\n\n        \nSo let’s assume you are a Java developer using Spring Boot and you want to make a parallel call within a single request. This is what you end up with: \n@PostMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\npublic Mono<User> storeUser(@RequestBody User user) {\n   Mono<URL> avatarMono = avatarService.randomAvatar();\n   Mono<Boolean> validEmailMono = emailService.verifyEmail(user.getEmail());\n   //🤨 what does ‘zip’ do?\n   return Mono.zip(avatarMono, validEmailMono).flatMap(tuple -> \n       if(!tuple.getT2()) //what is getT2()? It’s the validEmail Boolean…\n        //🤨 why can I not just throw an exception?\n         Mono.error(new InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid Email\"));\n       else personDao.save(UserBuilder.from(user)\n                                          .withAvatarUrl(tuple.getT1()));\n     );  \n  }\nEven though, from a runtime perspective, this code performs perfectly well, the accidental complexity introduced is enormous: \nThe code is dominated by Mono/Flux-es, throughout the whole call chain, which enforces you to wrap all domain objects.\nThere are many complex operators everywhere, like zip, flatMap, etc.\nYou cannot use standard programming constructs like throwing exceptions \nThe business intent of your code suffers significantly: the code focuses on Monos and flatMap, thereby obscuring what is truly happening from a business perspective.\nThe good news is that there is a powerful remedy in the form of Kotlin Coroutines. Coroutines can be framed as a reactive implementation on the language level. As such, they combine the best of both worlds: \nYou write sequential code like you did before.\nThe code is executed asynchronously / in parallel at runtime.\nThe above Java code converted to coroutines looks as follows:\n@GetMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\nsuspend fun storeUser(@RequestBody user:User):User = coroutineScope {\n   val avatarUrl = async { avatarService.randomAvatar() }\n   val validEmail = async { emailService.verifyEmail() }\n   if(!validEmail.await()) throw InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid email\")\n   personRepo.save(user.copy(avatar = avatarUrl.await()))\n}\nKotlin’s suspend keyword enables structured, non-blocking execution in a clear and concise manner. Together with async{} and await(), it facilitates parallel processing without the need for deeply nested callbacks or complex constructs such as Mono or CompletableFuture.\nThat’s why complexity will decrease, and developer joy and maintainability will increase, with the exact same performance characteristics. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Not all major Java-based web frameworks support Coroutines as well. Spring does an excellent job, as does Micronaut. Quarkus currently offers limited Coroutine support.\n6. But hey, Java is evolving too!\nJava keeps moving forward with features like records, pattern matching, and upcoming projects such as Amber, Valhalla, and Loom. This steady evolution strengthens the JVM and benefits the entire ecosystem.\nBut here’s the catch: most of these “new” Java features are things Kotlin developers have enjoyed for years. Null safety, value classes, top-level functions, default arguments, concise collections, and first-class functions are all baked into Kotlin’s design – delivered in a more unified and developer-friendly way. That’s why Kotlin code often feels cleaner, safer, and far more productive.\nAnd there is more: Kotlin also profits from Java’s innovation. JVM-level advances like Virtual Threads and Loom in general, or Valhalla’s performance boosts apply seamlessly to Kotlin too.\nIn short: Java evolves, but Kotlin was designed from day one to give developers the modern tools they need – making it a safe, modern, and forward-looking choice for building the future.\n\n\n\n\n7. Kotlin’s evolutionary advantage\nOlder programming languages inevitably carry legacy baggage compared to modern alternatives. Updating a language while supporting massive existing codebases presents unique challenges for language designers. Kotlin enjoys two crucial advantages:\nStanding on the shoulders of giants: Rather than reinventing the wheel, Kotlin’s initial design team gathered proven paradigms from major programming languages and unified them into a cohesive whole. This approach maximized evolutionary learning from the broader programming community.\nLearning from Java’s shortcomings: Kotlin’s designers could observe Java’s pitfalls and develop solid solutions from the ground up.\nFor deeper insights into Kotlin’s evolution, Andrey Breslav from Kotlin’s original design team gave an excellent talk at KotlinDevDay Amsterdam: Shoulders of Giants: Languages Kotlin Learned From – Andrey Breslav\nSoft factors: Support and connect developers in their Kotlin adoption journey\n1. Facilitate easy onboarding\nThe goal of the expressive Java vs. Kotlin code snippets is to whet the appetite for Kotlin. Code alone, however, is not enough to win the hearts and minds of Java developers. To accelerate adoption and ensure a smooth start, provide:\nSample project: A ready-to-run project with both Java and Kotlin code side-by-side, giving teams a practical reference during migration.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in quality checks: Preconfigured with tools like SonarQube, ktlint, and detekt to promote clean, consistent, and maintainable code from day one. This will enable you to apply consistent lint rules, testing frameworks, libraries, and CI pipelines to reduce friction across teams.\n\n\n\n\nCoaching and support: Experienced Kotlin engineers available to coach new teams, answer questions, and provide hands-on advice during the early stages of development.\n\nThis one is particularly important: with only a few hours of guidance from an experienced developer from another team who has gone through these stages before, much damage and technical debt can be prevented. \nA bit of support and coaching is the most powerful way to nurture lasting enthusiasm for Kotlin.\n2. Offer (self-)study material\nEspecially when coming from Java, learning the Kotlin basics can be done on your own. Providing some resources upfront eases the path to getting productive with Kotlin and lowers the threshold. \nJetBrains “Tour of Kotlin” (Get Started guide)\nA short, browser-based tutorial on the official Kotlin site.\nKotlin Koans\nA set of bite-sized coding challenges maintained by JetBrains.\nUdacity “Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers”\nA full video-based course created in partnership with Google.\nNote: Although self-study is valuable for grasping the basics, it also has some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is an optionality: being caught up in the day’s frenzy, it’s tempting to skip self-study. Moreover, you will lack feedback from a practitioner who knows the subtle nuances of correctly applied idiomatic Kotlin. There is a big chance that after a self-study course, you will write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits but does not unlock the full potential of the language. \nUnless you don’t have good coaching, a classical course can be very beneficial. There is a need to attend; you can exchange with peers of the same level and have your questions answered by an experienced professional, which will get you up to speed much faster with less non-idiomatic Kotlin during the initial transition. \n3. Establish an in-house Kotlin community\nOne of the fastest ways to level up Kotlin expertise across your company is to create and foremost nurture an in-house community.\nLaunch an internal Kotlin community\n\nFirst look for a core-team of at least 3–6 developers who are willing to invest in a Kotlin community. Also ensure they get time and credits from their managers for their task.\nOnce the team is formed, organize a company-wide kick-off with well-known speakers from the Kotlin community. This will ignite the Kotlin flame and give it momentum.\nSchedule regular meet-ups (monthly or bi-weekly) so momentum never drops.\nCreate a shared chat channel/wiki where questions, code snippets, and event notes live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvite (external) speakers\n\nBring in engineers who’ve shipped Kotlin in production to share candid war stories.\nAlternate between deep-dive technical talks (coroutines, KMP, functional programming) and higher-level case studies (migration strategies, tooling tips).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent lessons learned from other in-house projects\n\nAsk project leads to present their Kotlin learnings – what worked, what didn’t, and measurable outcomes.\nThese insights can be captured in a “Kotlin playbook” that new teams can pick up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your own developers the stage\n\nRun lightning-talk sessions where anyone can demo a neat trick, library, or failure they overcame in 5–10 minutes.\nCelebrate contributors publicly – shout-outs in all-hands or internal newsletters boost engagement and knowledge-sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep feedback loops tight\n\nAfter each session, collect quick polls on clarity and usefulness, then tweak future agendas accordingly.\nRotate organizational duties so the community doesn’t hinge on a single champion and stays resilient long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Many of the suggestions above sound straightforward. However, the effort needed to keep a community vibrant and alive should not be underestimated. \n4. Be patient…\nCultural change takes time. The danger of being enthusiastic about a tool that makes a difference for you is pushing things, which can be counterproductive. An effective approach is to nurture the adoption process with all the activities discussed above, with show, don’t tell as prior guidance.\nUp next in the series\nWe shift focus from convincing developers to persuading decision-makers. The next post shows how to build a compelling business case for Kotlin adoption, grounded in real data and measurable outcomes. You’ll learn how to translate developer wins into management arguments, link productivity gains to cost savings, and demonstrate why Kotlin is more than a technical upgrade – it’s a strategic move for teams and companies alike.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving domain of software development, Python has established itself as a premier language, renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It underpins a vast range of applications, from web development to artificial intelligence and data engineering. However, beneath its elegant syntax lies a potential challenge: performance bottlenecks that can transform otherwise efficient scripts into noticeably sluggish processes.\nWhether the task involves processing large datasets, developing real-time systems, or refining computational efficiency, optimizing Python code for speed can be a decisive factor in achieving superior results.\nThis guide presents 10 rigorously tested performance-enhancement strategies. Drawing upon Python’s built-in capabilities, efficient data structures, and low-level optimization techniques, it offers practical methods to accelerate code execution without compromising the language’s characteristic clarity and elegance. Supported by empirical benchmarks and illustrative code examples, these techniques demonstrate how incremental improvements can yield substantial performance gains – empowering developers to transition from proficient practitioners to true experts in high-performance Python programming.\nLet’s dive in and turbocharge your Python prowess!\nHack 1: Leverage sets for membership testing\nWhen you need to check whether an element exists within a collection, using a list can be inefficient – especially as the size of the list grows. Membership testing with a list (x in some_list) requires scanning each element one by one, resulting in linear time complexity (O(n)):\nbig_list = list(range(1000000))\nbig_set = set(big_list)\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_list)\nprint(f\"List lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_set)\nprint(f\"Set lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\nTime measured:\nList lookup: ~0.015000s\nSet lookup: ~0.000020s\nIn contrast, sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, which allow for constant-time (O(1)) lookups on average. This means that checking whether a value exists in a set is significantly faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.\nFor tasks like filtering duplicates, validating input, or cross-referencing elements between collections, sets are far more efficient than lists. They not only speed up membership tests but also make operations like unions, intersections, and differences much faster and more concise.\nBy switching from lists to sets for membership checks – particularly in performance-critical code – you can achieve meaningful speed gains with minimal changes to your logic.\nHack 2: Avoid unnecessary copies\nCopying large objects like lists, dictionaries, or arrays can be costly in both time and memory. Each copy creates a new object in memory, which can lead to significant overhead, especially when working with large datasets or within tight loops.\nWhenever possible, modify objects in place instead of creating duplicates. This reduces memory usage and improves performance by avoiding the overhead of allocating and populating new structures. Many built-in data structures in Python provide in-place methods (e.g. sort, append, update) that eliminate the need for copies.\nnumbers = list(range(1000000))\ndef modify_list(lst):\n    lst[0] = 999\n    return lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = modify_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"In-place: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef copy_list(lst):\n    new_lst = lst.copy()\n    new_lst[0] = 999\n    return new_lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = copy_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"Copy: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nIn-place: ~0.0001s\nCopy: ~0.0100s\nIn performance-critical code, being mindful of when and how objects are duplicated can make a noticeable difference. By working with references and in-place operations, you can write more efficient and memory-friendly code, particularly when handling large or complex data structures.\nHack 3: Use __slots__ for memory efficiency\nBy default, Python classes store instance attributes in a dynamic dictionary (__dict__), which offers flexibility but comes with memory overhead and slightly slower attribute access.\nUsing __slots__ allows you to explicitly declare a fixed set of attributes for a class. This eliminates the need for a __dict__, reducing memory usage – which is especially beneficial when creating many instances of a class. It also leads to marginally faster attribute access due to the simplified internal structure.\nWhile __slots__ does restrict dynamic attribute assignment, this trade-off is often worthwhile in memory-constrained environments or performance-sensitive applications. For lightweight classes or data containers, applying __slots__ is a simple way to make your code more efficient.\nclass Point:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\nstart = time.time()\npoints = [Point(i, i+1) for i in range(1000000)]\nprint(f\"With slots: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nWith __slots__: ~0.1200s\nWithout __slots__: ~0.1500s\nHack 4: Use math functions instead of operators\nFor numerical computations, Python’s math module provides functions that are implemented in C, offering better performance and precision than equivalent operations written in pure Python.\nFor example, using math.sqrt() is typically faster and more accurate than raising a number to the power of 0.5 using the exponentiation (**) operator. Similarly, functions like math.sin(), math.exp(), and math.log() are highly optimized for speed and reliability.\nThese performance benefits become especially noticeable in tight loops or large-scale calculations. By relying on the math module for heavy numerical work, you can achieve both faster execution and more consistent results – making it the preferred choice for scientific computing, simulations, or any math-heavy code.\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm makes it even easier to take advantage of the math module by providing intelligent code completion. Simply typing math. triggers a dropdown list of all available mathematical functions and constants – such as sqrt(), sin(), cos(), log(), pi, and many more – along with inline documentation. \nThis not only speeds up development by reducing the need to memorize function names, but also encourages the use of optimized, built-in implementations over custom or operator-based alternatives. By leveraging these hints, developers can quickly explore the full breadth of the module and write cleaner, faster numerical code with confidence.\nimport math\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [math.sqrt(n) for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Math sqrt: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [n ** 0.5 for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Operator: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nmath.sqrt: ~0.2000s\nOperator: ~0.2500s\nHack 5: Pre-allocate memory with known sizes\nWhen building lists or arrays dynamically, Python resizes them in the background as they grow. While convenient, this resizing involves memory allocation and data copying, which adds overhead – especially in large or performance-critical loops.\nIf you know the final size of your data structure in advance, pre-allocating memory can significantly improve performance. By initializing a list or array with a fixed size, you avoid repeated resizing and allow Python (or libraries like NumPy) to manage memory more efficiently.\nThis technique is particularly valuable in numerical computations, simulations, and large-scale data processing, where even small optimizations can add up. Pre-allocation helps reduce fragmentation, improves cache locality, and ensures more predictable performance.\nstart = time.time()\nresult = [0] * 1000000\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result[i] = i\nprint(f\"Pre-allocated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result.append(i)\nprint(f\"Dynamic: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nPre-allocated: ~0.0300s\nDynamic: ~0.0400s\nHack 6: Avoid exception handling in hot loops\nWhile Python’s exception handling is powerful and clean for managing unexpected behavior, it’s not designed for high-frequency use inside performance-critical loops. Raising and catching exceptions involves stack unwinding and context switching, which are relatively expensive operations.\nIn hot loops – sections of code that run repeatedly or process large volumes of data – using exceptions for control flow can significantly degrade performance. Instead, use conditional checks (if, in, is, etc.) to prevent errors before they occur. This proactive approach is much faster and leads to more predictable execution.\nReserving exceptions for truly exceptional cases, rather than expected control flow, results in cleaner and faster code – especially in tight loops or real-time applications where performance matters.\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    if i % 2 != 0:\n        total += i // 2\n    else:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Conditional: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    try:\n        total += i / (i % 2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Exception: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nConditional: ~0.3000s\nException: ~0.6000s\nHack 7: Use local functions for repeated logic\nWhen a specific piece of logic is used repeatedly within a function, defining it as a local (nested) function – also known as a closure – can improve performance and organization. Local functions benefit from faster name resolution because Python looks up variables more quickly in local scopes than in global ones.\nIn addition to the performance gain, local functions help encapsulate logic, making your code cleaner and more modular. They can also capture variables from the enclosing scope, allowing you to write more flexible and reusable inner logic without passing extra arguments.\nThis technique is particularly useful in functions that apply the same operation multiple times, such as loops, data transformations, or recursive processes. By keeping frequently used logic local, you reduce both runtime overhead and cognitive load.\nHint: Use AI Assistant’s Suggest Refactoring\nIf you’re using PyCharm (or any JetBrains product) with the AI Assistant plugin, one particularly powerful tool is Suggest Refactoring. With it, you can select a segment of code, invoke the AI Assistant, and ask it to propose cleaner or more efficient alternatives – all in one go. \nThe assistant shows you a “refactored” version of your code, lets you view the diff (what would change), and you can accept either selected snippets or the whole block. This helps maintain consistency, enforce best practices, and catch opportunities for improvement you might otherwise miss.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Suggest Refactoring\nHere are step-by-step instructions (as per JetBrains’ documentation) on how to use this feature:\nSelect the code fragment you want to refactor.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the popup appears (e.g. small lightbulb or context menu), click the AI Assistant icon.\n\n\n\n\nChoose Suggest Refactoring in the menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe AI Chat pane then opens with its proposed refactorings. In it, you can:\nClick Show Diff to compare the original against the proposed code.\n\n\n\n\nOr if you prefer, you can select Apply Immediately to skip the diff and apply the suggestion directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the suggested changes, click Accept on individual snippets (in the gutter) or Accept All to replace the entire selected fragment.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t like the suggestions, you can always close the diff or dialog without applying.\ndef outer():\n    def add_pair(a, b):\n        return a + b\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(10000000):\n        result = add_pair(result, i)\n    return result\nstart = time.time()\nresult = outer()\nprint(f\"Local function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef add_pair(a, b):\n    return a + b\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(10000000):\n    result = add_pair(result, i)\nprint(f\"Global function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nLocal function: ~0.4000s\nGlobal function: ~0.4500s\nHack 8: Use itertools for combinatorial operations\nWhen dealing with permutations, combinations, Cartesian products, or other iterator-based tasks, Python’s itertools module provides a suite of highly efficient, C-optimized tools tailored for these use cases.\nFunctions like product(), permutations(), combinations(), and combinations_with_replacement() generate elements lazily, meaning they don’t store the entire result in your computer’s memory. This allows you to work with large or infinite sequences without the performance or memory penalties of manual implementations.\nIn addition to being fast, itertools functions are composable and memory-efficient, making them ideal for complex data manipulation, algorithm development, and problem-solving tasks like those found in simulations, search algorithms, or competitive programming. When performance and scalability matter, itertools is a go-to solution.\nfrom itertools import product\nitems = [1, 2, 3] * 10\nstart = time.time()\nresult = list(product(items, repeat=2))\nprint(f\"Itertools: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor x in items:\n    for y in items:\n        result.append((x, y))\nprint(f\"Loops: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nitertools: ~0.0005s\nLoops: ~0.0020s\nHack 9: Use bisect for sorted list operations\nWhen working with sorted lists, using linear search or manual insertion logic can be inefficient – especially as the list grows. Python’s bisect module provides fast, efficient tools for maintaining sorted order using binary search.\nWith functions like bisect_left(), bisect_right(), and insort(), you can perform insertions and searches in O(log n) time, as opposed to the O(n) complexity of a simple scan. This is particularly useful in scenarios like maintaining leaderboards, event timelines, or implementing efficient range queries.\nBy using bisect, you avoid re-sorting after every change and gain a significant performance boost when working with dynamic, sorted data. It’s a lightweight and powerful tool that brings algorithmic efficiency to common list operations.\nimport bisect\nnumbers = sorted(list(range(0, 1000000, 2)))\nstart = time.time()\nbisect.insort(numbers, 75432)\nprint(f\"Bisect: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nfor i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n    if num > 75432:\n        numbers.insert(i, 75432)\n        break\nprint(f\"Loop: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nbisect: ~0.0001s\nLoop: ~0.0100s\nHack 10: Avoid repeated function calls in loops\nCalling the same function multiple times inside a loop – especially if the function is expensive or produces the same result each time – can lead to unnecessary overhead. Even relatively fast functions can accumulate significant cost when called repeatedly in large loops.\nTo optimize, compute the result once outside the loop and store it in a local variable. This reduces function call overhead and improves runtime efficiency, particularly in performance-critical sections of code.\nThis technique is simple but effective. It not only speeds up execution but also enhances code clarity by signaling that the value is constant within the loop’s context. Caching function results is one of the easiest ways to eliminate redundant computation and make your code more efficient.\ndef expensive_operation():\n    time.sleep(0.001)\n    return 42\nstart = time.time()\ncached_value = expensive_operation()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += cached_value\nprint(f\"Cached: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += expensive_operation()\nprint(f\"Repeated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nCached: ~0.0010s\nRepeated: ~1.0000s\nIn summary\nFrom leveraging the inherent efficiency of Python’s built-in functions and high-performance libraries such as NumPy to employing memory-conscious techniques with __slots__ and generators, these fifteen Python performance strategies provide a comprehensive set of tools for enhancing execution speed. \nThe methods explored include optimizing iterative processes with comprehensions, utilizing sets for rapid membership checks, avoiding unnecessary data copies and exception handling overhead, and applying bitwise operations as arithmetic shortcuts.\nSpecialized modules such as itertools, bisect, and collections further streamline complex tasks, while adherence to best practices – such as minimizing the use of global variables, pre-allocating memory, and implementing caching – ensures lean, efficient code execution. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that even minor adjustments can yield significant time savings in large-scale operations, reinforcing the principle that effective optimization does not necessitate a complete code rewrite.\nWhether refining a standalone script or scaling a production-level application, these techniques, when applied judiciously, can significantly enhance performance while conserving system resources. Ultimately, the most effective optimizations strike a balance between speed and clarity.\nAbout the author\nDido Grigorov\nDido is a seasoned Deep Learning Engineer and Python programmer with an impressive 17 years of experience in the field.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "PhpStorm comes with a ton of built-in features, and you can add even more with plugins. They bring new languages, tools, and small improvements that make everyday coding smoother.\nMany of the best ones come from independent developers. One of them is Dmitrii Derepko, who built several handy tools for working with web projects and PHP. Below are a few of his creations worth checking out.\nIf you’re curious about plugin development, don’t miss the JetBrains Plugin Developer Conference 2025  – free online conference. Dmitrii will be speaking there and will walk you through plugin creation basics: from the initial setup to releasing it on JetBrains Marketplace.\n.​gitattributes support\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever worked with libraries distributed through Composer, NPM, or other package managers, you’ve probably seen a .gitattributes file. It controls how your project looks when archived (via git archive) and which files get included or excluded when users install your package.\nThe .gitattributes Support plugin adds first-class editing experience for this file in PhpStorm. It highlights syntax, recognizes attribute rules, and even suggests valid options while you type so you don’t have to look them up each time.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Modern IDEs are powerful tools with many useful features. When we talk about developer productivity, one thing that comes to mind is mastering the IDE – learning its features, like refactorings, navigation, or code generation, and remembering how to invoke them.\nHowever, discovering all the relevant features of your IDE, and knowing when and how to use them can be challenging. Once you know a given feature exists, there are different ways to invoke it:\n Shortcuts are fast, but it is hard to remember all of them.\n Search Everywhere (⇧⇧) is great, but it pulls you out of your flow.\n Intention actions (Alt+Enter) help, but they are discoverable only when the IDE points them out.\nOur research shows that most developers can only confidently recall a few shortcuts, for example (often three or fewer). The number of useful IDE actions we need is far greater than this. When the right shortcut is hard to find or remember, we rely on menus, hints, and other visual helpers. That’s how IDEs have evolved for years: layering discoverability tools around a keyboard-driven core.\nOne feature every developer does use is code completion. Start typing, and the IDE suggests keywords, variables, or method names. Press the dot button (.) and see relevant API members and templates – it’s so natural that modern development feels impossible without it. Now, we aim to extend this familiar experience beyond code – to the IDE itself. This way, you can discover and execute actions the same way you complete code: context-aware, inline, and without breaking your flow.\n\n\nA brief overview of the command completion feature\n\n\n\nIntroducing command completion\nTo help you unlock the full potential of your IDE, we are offering a universal entry point to relevant actions. \nCommand completion is our attempt to provide a new way to access context-aware actions directly from your editor. It extends the existing code completion (accessible via .) that many developers are already using. Command completion works like regular completion, but in addition to classes, methods, and templates, the popup also suggests actions relevant to your current context.\nType . to see code completion, postfix completion, and action suggestions.\nType .. to filter completion suggestions to actions only.\nSelect the action to see the exact context and preview what the action will do if applied.\nTo enable this Beta feature in 2025.2, go to Settings | Editor | General | Code Completion | Command Completion and select Enable command completion.\nEnable Command Completion in settings (IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2)\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with command completion\nCommand completion offers you context-sensitive relevant actions. Depending on where you are in the editor, the list of suggestions may include:\nFixes for issues – quick-fixes and warnings directly from the completion popup.\nCode transformations – actions like Introduce local variable, Reformat code, or Convert to Markdown documentation comment (Java 23+), for example.\nRefactoring and navigation – commonly used actions such as Rename or Go to declaration, as well as context-specific ones like Change signature, may appear when relevant.\nCode generation – options to generate things like constructors or getters/setters, as well as toString() or test methods.\nIn frameworks, IntelliJ IDEA may also suggest relevant actions (e.g. Spring bean wiring). The feature is still evolving, and more framework- and file-type support will be added. Our goal is to provide a seamless typing experience with commands in every environment, even binaries. \nHow does command completion compare to existing features?\nIntelliJ IDEA already has multiple ways to use existing features. Let’s see how command completion compares:\nShortcuts – are great for speed, especially for frequently used actions, but learning shortcuts requires effort. This means there is a steep learning curve, and powerful features often go underused. The pool of meaningful key combinations is limited, and most shortcuts are not intuitive or memorable. Command completion is easier to use, since it does not require you to remember shortcuts; only the action you want to perform.\nIntention actions (Alt+Enter) – IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code and highlights issues or improvements. Intention actions provide quick-fixes, but excessive highlighting can sometimes be distracting. Quick-fixes are reactive and limited to detected issues. Intention actions offer only a limited set of actions. Command completion offers you all the actions that are relevant to your current context. The list of actions is searchable, so you can find what you need.\nPostfix completion – Built-in templates let you quickly transform an existing expression with a single, meaningful suffix. For example,  .var transforms an existing expression into a properly declared variable, allowing you to keep moving forward when writing code. They require you to know about them, to know a template exists, or to be able to quickly find it. Command completion extends this idea to all actions, without requiring you to know the exact names of templates or commands.\nSearch Everywhere (⇧⇧) – This feature allows you to find anything inside IntelliJ IDEA. However, it requires multiple steps to perform an actual action: You have to open the dialog, type the name of the desired action (which requires you to know the name), navigate the results, and confirm the action; all of which pull you out of your coding flow. More importantly, it’s detached from the current code context. Command completion keeps you in the editor, in your current context, offering only actions that are relevant there.\nCode completion – In IntelliJ IDEA, code completion will automatically appear where relevant. It can also be explicitly invoked by typing a dot (.) or the shortcut (⌃␣ on macOS) / Ctrl+Space on Windows/Linux). In addition to classes, methods, and templates, command completion adds a list of context-relevant actions. You will find them in the list of regular completion. You can filter this list to commands only, using double dot (..). You can also type ”..” anywhere in your editor to see which commands are available in that context.\nCommand completion is a new and complementary way to work with IntelliJ IDEA, not a replacement for existing features. It combines the speed of shortcuts with the discoverability of Search Everywhere, in an easily accessible, context-aware experience. It helps you discover relevant, powerful features, in the context where you are working. We hope it feels like a natural extension of your existing workflow and helps you to be more productive.\nIn short: Command completion doesn’t replace existing features – it extends and complements them. \nWhy this matters\nIntelliJ IDEA is designed to keep you in the coding flow. Command completion helps with this by offering the following benefits:\nContext-awareness: Suggestions adapt to where you are in your code.\nCollaboration: Easier for experienced users to guide newcomers – just type “.change signature” – no shortcut knowledge required.\nConsistency: Works across different keymaps, OSes, and workflows.\nDiscoverability: See what actions are possible without leaving the editor.\nCommand completion allows you to think about what you want to achieve, instead of how to do so. This will also make pair programming easier, as you only need to describe what you want to do without having to interrupt your flow to find how to do it.  \nLooking ahead\nCommand completion is still in Beta in 2025.2, with improvements ongoing. At the moment, we have support for Java and Kotlin, as well as a few framework-specific actions that are also provided as intention actions, like Autowire Bean when you are using Spring Framework, or Extract JPQL Query for a Spring Data repository. \nMore actions, file types, and framework-specific commands will appear in future releases, not only for Spring, but also for Hibernate and other frameworks. For example, in the 2025.3 EAP, you can already navigate read-only files with .., Go to Declaration, or Go to Implementation – even in external libraries. Also in 2025.3 EAP, commands come with aliases, so you don’t have to remember the exact names. \nThe feature will be turned on by default in 2025.3, but there will be further improvements after that. We are also planning to add the option to add your own actions to command completion. Finally, we’re exploring integration with AI, so you could type things like “.suggest better name” or “.explain this”.\nInitial feedback\nWe very much appreciate your feedback and will be using it to guide the development process. So far, our first Beta users have indicated that the feature is promising. \nA lot of comments were provided under the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream where the command completion feature was introduced:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also received some direct feedback on LinkedIn and other Social Media: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out: Go to Settings, enable Command Completion, type . in the editor, and explore. You might discover powerful IDE features you never knew were there!\nPlease let us know what you think. We would love to hear how you are using command completion in your daily work and what we could add to make it even better. Thank you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the most recent JetBrains.NET Days Online 2025 event, Maarten Balliauw delivered a comprehensive session on migrating existing codebases to use C# nullable reference types, a feature that’s been available since C# 8 but remains underutilized in many legacy projects. Through practical examples and migration strategies, Maarten demonstrated how to bring null safety to your existing code without drowning in thousands of warnings.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\n#nullable enable – Unlock the Power of C# Nullability — Maarten Balliauw\nIt’s not for runtime safety\nMaarten opens with a crucial clarification that sets realistic expectations for the entire migration journey: “There is no runtime safety for nullable reference types. It is design time and compile time that help to check whether something can be null or not.” This isn’t a silver bullet that will eliminate all null reference exceptions – it’s a tool to help developers make better decisions while writing code.\nThe feature essentially flips the traditional C# paradigm. As Maarten explains, “The idea is that when you’re writing code, every single type that you have is going to be non-nullable by default. And there is a syntax to annotate a reference type as being nullable.” This inversion makes nullability explicit rather than implicit, forcing developers to think intentionally about null handling.\nThe Boy Scout Rule for migration\nWhen it comes to migrating existing codebases, Maarten advocates for a pragmatic approach. For smaller projects, you might enable nullability project-wide and plow through the warnings. But for larger codebases, he recommends the Boy Scout Rule: \n“Keep it disabled at the project level. And whenever you touch a piece of code, you enable it file by file and just work your way through until the entire project is converted.”\nThe key insight for where to begin? “Start at the center and work outwards” (29:59). Maarten suggests starting with classes that have few dependencies but are used extensively throughout the codebase, typically data transfer objects and domain models. A small change in these central classes can eliminate warnings across your entire codebase.\nThe temptation of the dammit operator\nThroughout the presentation, Maarten repeatedly warns against one particular anti-pattern: the null-forgiving operator (!), also known as the “dammit operator”. His stance is unequivocal: “The null forgiving operator is an anti-pattern.”\nWhy such strong language? “You’re lying to the compiler. You’re lying to yourself when you are working in this codebase a couple of months after you first wrote the code.” While the operator can be useful during migration to temporarily suppress warnings, Maarten emphasizes that production code should never ship with these suppressions.\nEmbracing null, not fighting it\nIn a refreshing perspective shift, Maarten reminds developers: “Don’t be afraid of null. Nullable reference types will help you get more confidence in compiler and IDE flow analysis. It’s impossible to get rid of all of the null usages in code” (37:23). The goal isn’t to eliminate null entirely, it’s to build a safety net for dealing with it effectively.\nThis philosophy extends to library authors, who need to consider consumers using different languages. Since nullable reference types are C# only, libraries should still include runtime null checks for robustness, especially when the API might be consumed by F# or VB.NET code that won’t benefit from the nullable annotations.\nEntity Framework’s surprise\nOne of the most valuable warnings in the presentation concerns Entity Framework Core, which has a potentially breaking behavior: “The Entity Framework Core team, unfortunately, did look at this, and they are actually updating your database schema based on nullable reference types.”\nThis means that enabling nullable reference types can inadvertently trigger database schema changes, something that might slip past developers but certainly won’t escape the notice of your DBA. It’s a “gotcha” that Maarten admits makes sense from Entity Framework’s perspective, but one that can be an unwelcome surprise during migration.\nPractical tools for the journey\nMaarten highlights several tools that make migration more manageable (38:28). The value tracking feature in Microsoft Visual Studio and Rider helps trace where properties are set, making it easier to determine if something can actually be null. The automatic migration tools can get you quite far along the way by running flow analysis and making educated guesses about nullability.\nFor JSON serialization scenarios, Maarten presents multiple strategies, with his personal favorite being the use of the required keyword combined with proper validation, rather than littering code with null-forgiving operators or losing type safety by making everything nullable.\nThe takeaway\nMaarten’s session demystifies the migration to nullable reference types, presenting it not as an all-or-nothing proposition but as a gradual improvement process. His closing summary captures the essence perfectly: “Nullable reference types give you design time and compile time safety in .NET, not at runtime.”\nThis session serves as both a technical guide and a philosophical framework for approaching nullability. It’s not about achieving perfection or eliminating all nulls – it’s about making your codebase more predictable, maintainable, and explicit about its null-handling intentions.\nFor teams sitting on legacy codebases wondering if the migration effort is worth it, the essence of Maarten’s argument is that the investment in nullable reference types pays dividends in code clarity, reduced bugs, and better communication of intent between team members, including your future self.\nFollow Maarten Balliauw’s work on nullable reference types and other C# topics on his blog, X, and Bluesky.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI Qith Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nThe Null-Forgiving Operator in C# Is a Code Smell(!)  by Matthew Champion.\nNullable reference types in C# – Migrating to nullable reference types by Maarten Balliauw. \nNullable reference types and nullability in EF Core by Damir Arh.\nNull & Void – Everything About Nothing in .NET – a presentation given by Stefan Pölz at .NET Days Online 2021.",

Recently, you’ve shared important feedback about AI usage limits, transparency, and the freedom to choose which AI providers you use. We heard you loud and clear.\nThat’s why we are working to introduce bring-your-own-key (BYOK) support for JetBrains AI Assistant and Junie. Simply put, BYOK will allow you to connect your personal accounts from OpenAI (or any compatible API) and Anthropic so you can use them directly in your JetBrains IDE. This feature will later be extended to work with Google Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and even self-hosted local models, and you will even be able to use it without a JetBrains AI subscription.\nWhy BYOK?\nWe understand that quotas can feel restrictive, and unclear usage policies can lead to frustration. With the BYOK feature, you will no longer be limited to JetBrains-managed quotas. Instead, you will use your own existing AI provider accounts, gaining clear visibility into your usage and costs directly from your provider.\nWhat will this mean for you?\nFreedom of choice: Pick your preferred AI model or provider. Whether it’s the latest cutting-edge model from Anthropic or Google, or a cost-efficient local model hosted on your own servers, you will decide what best suits your workflow.\n\n\n\n\nFull transparency: Clearly see how much each AI interaction costs in real time on your selected platform, without worrying about hidden quotas or unexpected interruptions.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and security: Your API keys will remain securely stored and managed on your own machine and will never be shared with JetBrains. Your data will stay between you and your chosen AI provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an open ecosystem\nWith planned support for industry standards like the OpenAI API, ACP (Agent Client Protocol), Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol, and other common interfaces, JetBrains is committed to creating an open ecosystem. This approach means your IDE will become a hub that’s open to all current – and future – AI providers, without forcing vendor lock-in.\nWhat’s next?\nWe expect to add this feature by the end of the year, and this is just the beginning of our journey. We’re currently also working on expanding the range of supported AI providers, simplifying configurations, and refining features based on your feedback.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and learn which features you’d like us to prioritize next.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we approach the release of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we would like to share key information about changes that may impact your plugin development process. This post addresses common questions from the developer community and provides guidance on maintaining compatibility with the latest IntelliJ Platform versions.\nNo Immediate Upgrade Required\nIf you built your plugin against the IntelliJ Platform 2025.2 or earlier, it should remain compatible with 2025.3. You don’t need to rush to update right away.\nTip: Check compatibility locally by running the verifyPlugin Gradle task. This performs the same IntelliJ Plugin Verifier checks that are automatically run on JetBrains Marketplace when you upload plugin updates.\nThe IntelliJ Platform maintains strong backward compatibility, which generally preserves between minor versions. It means you can take your time testing and migrating your plugins.\nMajor Change: Unified Platform Distribution\nWhat’s Changing?\nStarting with version 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA Community and Ultimate will be delivered as a unified platform. This marks a significant architectural change that makes plugin development and distribution easier. Read the full announcement: IntelliJ IDEA Moves to the Unified Distribution.\nStarting with 2025.1, PyCharm has undergone the same unification. Learn more in the PyCharm Unified blog post.\nNote: These updates only affect plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later. If your plugin still uses the IntelliJ Platform in version 2025.2 or earlier, no changes are needed at this time. References to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Community for older versions continue working.\nKey Implications for Plugin Developers\nWith the unified distribution:\nIntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (IC) builds for 2025.3 and later are no longer available. Trying to resolve artifacts using IC-2025.3, IC-253.x.y, or the intellijIdeaCommunity() dependency helper will cause an error.\nFor version 2025.3 and future versions, you must target intellijIdea() as a platform artifact.\nWhen targeting PyCharm 2025.1 and above, use ⁠pycharm(version) instead of ⁠pycharmCommunity(version) and ⁠pycharmProfessional(version).\nThe unified distribution retains the same IU product code as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nThe difference between Community and Ultimate now depends on licensing and feature access, not separate IDE distributions. All IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate plugins are included in the distribution but are disabled if there is no active subscription.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) is available in a unified distribution and does not require a subscription.\nDepending on Paid Functionality\nIf your plugin requires subscription-based features, you can explicitly depend on com.intellij.modules.ultimate. This module represents the licensing mechanism; when a user doesn’t have an active subscription, this module and all plugins that depend on it are disabled.\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.ultimate</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nWhat Does This Mean for Your Users?\nUsers upgrading from IntelliJ IDEA Community 2025.2  will be smoothly transitioned to the unified IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 as part of a regular version update. All plugins will continue working. \nThe free tier now offers additional features:\nBasic database functions (schema viewing, SQL completion).\nProject wizards for Spring Boot, Ktor, and other frameworks.\nBasic syntax highlighting for frameworks.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration (previously only available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate).\nRequirements\nTo work with version 2025.3, update the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\nplugins {\n  id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nWhen targeting 2025.3 for development, you must use the new ⁠intellijIdea() dependency helper—whether your plugin targets IntelliJ IDEA specifically or all other IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform.\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        // or intellijIdeaUltimate(\"2025.2\")\n\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\nWhen targeting PyCharm specifically, use the pycharm() dependency:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharmCommunity(\"2024.3\")\n        // or pycharmProfessional(\"2024.3\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharm(\"2025.3\")\n    }\n}\nSee the Step-by-Step Migration Guide below for detailed instructions on updating your plugin.\nOpen Source and Custom IDEs\nFor developers building custom IDEs or using the open source version:\nThe open source code remains available on GitHub at JetBrains/intellij-community.\nGitHub Actions are now provided to simplify the process of building the IDE from source.\nPre-built open source versions can be found on GitHub Releases.\nThe open-source build utilizes the Community Edition (IC) product code and is compatible with all plugins that work with the Community Edition.\nCustom IDEs, like Android Studio, continue to function as before.\nKey API Changes in 2025.3\nModule Extraction and Explicit Dependencies\nSeveral modules have been separated from the core plugin into their own modules, each with its own individual classloader. While this does not affect binary compatibility, it is advisable to explicitly depend on the modules you need using bundledModule(moduleName):\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth.base\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.backend\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.protocolReaderRuntime\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.ui\nintellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\nintellij.platform.vcs.log\nintellij.platform.vcs.log.graph\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.log\")\n    }\n}\nIntelliLang Plugin Dependency Change\nIf your plugin relies on the org.intellij.intelliLang plugin, declare a dependency on the bundled module intellij.platform.langInjection:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"org.intellij.intelliLang\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.langInjection\")\n    }\n}\nStorage Annotation Restriction\nThe @Storage annotation can no longer be used at the top level. It must only be used within @State.storages.\n@Service\n@State(name = \"MySettings\", storages = [Storage(\"MySettings.xml\")])\nclass MySettings : PersistentStateComponent<MySettings> {\n\n  var myProperty = false\n\n  override fun getState() = this\n\n  override fun loadState(state: MySettings) = XmlSerializerUtil.copyBean(state, this)\n\n  companion object {\n    fun getInstance(): MySettings = service()\n  }\n}\nWhy Explicit Dependencies Matter\nDeclaring explicit dependencies on the plugins and modules your plugin uses is a best practice. It makes your plugin’s requirements clear to both the platform and other developers, ensures proper dependency loading order, and helps JetBrains Marketplace determine product compatibility.\nUnderstanding Dependencies: Gradle Build Script vs plugin.xml\nDependencies on plugins and modules defined in your Gradle build script, using the plugin(), bundledPlugin(), and bundledModule() dependency helpers, interact with the compilation classpath to ensure they are available during plugin development. However, to make them available at runtime for your plugin, it’s also required to define them in your plugin.xml file. See the Plugin Dependencies documentation for details.\nExample with plugin dependencies\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.java</depends>\n    <depends>org.intellij.scala</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nExample with plugin and bundled module dependencies\nIf your plugin depends on bundled modules, you must use the plugin model v2 dependencies definition, which requires the <dependencies> block with a clear separation between plugin and module dependencies.\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <dependencies>\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.modules.platform\" />\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.java\" />\n        <plugin id=\"org.intellij.scala\" />\n        <module name=\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\" />\n    </dependencies>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nThis ensures that your plugin can compile with these dependencies during development and access them at runtime when users install it.\nStep-by-Step Migration Guide\nUpdate Your Gradle Plugin Version\nUpdate the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version, currently 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\n[org.jetbrains.intellij.platform] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is outdated: 2.10.0. Update `org.jetbrains.intellij.platform` to: 2.10.4\nTo update your setup to the latest version, simply increase the plugin version in the build.gradle.kts file or the ./gradle/libs.versions.toml if applicable.\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nTesting Against 2025.3 Before Official Release\nEven if your plugin is designed for older versions of the IntelliJ Platform, it can still be used in future releases. To ensure compatibility with newer IDEs than the SDK you use, utilize the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier tool to check binary compatibility against other IntelliJ Platform versions.\nIn build.gradle.kts specify:\nintellijPlatform {\n   pluginVerification {\n        ides {\n            recommended()\n        }\n    }\n}\nNext, run the verifyPlugin Gradle task to perform the verification and identify any potential issues that require attention.\nIt is also possible to manually run a specific IDE with a different version than the one set for development, with your plugin loaded. To do this, register a new runEap Gradle task and execute it immediately afterward.\nval runEap by intellijPlatformTesting.runIde.registering {\n    type = IntelliJPlatformType.IntellijIdea\n    version = \"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\"\n    useInstaller = false\n}\nSwitching to 2025.3 for development\nImportant: The installer for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 will only be available once 2025.3 is officially released. Until then, if you want to test your plugin against 2025.3 early, you have two options:\nUse a specific EAP release\nAll published JetBrains IDEs available for download are ready for use by all users and should also be used for plugin development to reflect our customers’ needs. To do this, you can simply add the IntelliJ Platform dependency using intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). However, if such a version is not yet available, you can refer to early access releases, which include their build numbers, available on the IntelliJ IDEA EAP download page or in a machine-readable JSON feed.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253.27864.23\")\n    }\n}\nUse snapshot versions\nJetBrains IDEs are also released as snapshots in the IntelliJ Platform Artifacts Repositories. To switch to these intermediate releases, you need to opt out of the installer artifacts and use a version specific to the IntelliJ Snapshots Maven Repository.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\") {\n            useInstaller = false\n        }\n    }\n}\nOnce 2025.3 is officially released, simply use intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). For more details, see the Target Versions documentation.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I need to update my plugin immediately when 2025.3 is released?\nNo, plugins built for 2025.2 or older versions should still work with 2025.3.\nWhat if my plugin only supports versions earlier than 2025.3?\nNo changes needed. The older syntax (intellijIdeaCommunity(version), intellijIdeaUltimate(version), pycharmCommunity(version), and pycharmProfessional(version)) still works for older versions.\nWill my plugin work with both free-tier and paid subscription users?\nYes, using the intellijIdea(\"2025.3\") makes your plugin work for all users regardless of subscription status.\nDo I need to build multiple versions of my plugin for 2025.2 and 2025.3?\nNo. The platform type you specify in your build script is only used during plugin development. Your plugin.xml file contains the actual compatibility information through <depends> declarations and the since-build attribute. A single plugin build can work across multiple IDE versions.\nGradle fails with “Could not find idea:ideaIC:253.x.x”. What should I do?\nThis occurs because Community Edition builds are not available for versions 2025.3 and later. You have two options:\nUse an older version of IntelliJ IDEA Community for building, which will still make your plugin compatible with 2025.3.\nUpgrade the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to 2.10.4 and switch to intellijIdea(version).\nIf 2025.3 has not been released yet, you can use EAP by specifying a build number as the version.\nSet the version to 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT and set useInstaller = false.\nHow do I know which modules to include explicitly in dependencies?\nThe IntelliJ Plugin Verifier will report missing dependencies. Refer to the Key API Changes in 2025.3 section above.\nHow can I test against 2025.3 before the official release?\nUse specific EAP build numbers or snapshot versions, such as 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT, with useInstaller set to false. See Testing Against 2025.3 Before Official Release above.\nWhat versioning scheme should I use if I need separate builds for different versions?\nUse a SemVer-compatible scheme with suffixes, such as 1.2.3-251 for the 2025.1 version and 1.2.3-253 for the 2025.3 version. JetBrains Marketplace will automatically serve the correct version based on the user’s IDE version and your since-build and until-build attributes.\nConclusion\nThe IntelliJ Platform 2025.3 release introduces a unified IntelliJ IDEA distribution while maintaining strong backward compatibility. Plugins built for earlier IntelliJ Platform versions will still work with 2025.3, giving you time to migrate at your own pace.\nWhen you’re ready to target 2025.3, update to IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.10.4 or later and switch to the new intellijIdea() dependency helper. The platform APIs stay consistent across all license types, ensuring that your plugin works the same way for all users. Declare explicit dependencies on the modules you need, and use the verifyPlugin task to test compatibility before publishing.\nGot questions? Contact us on the JetBrains Platform Forum.

That means, as you prompt how you normally would, Copilot is looking for instances where you correct its behavior, explicitly indicate a standard, or ask it to remember something. When detected, you’ll see a confirmation nudge to save the preference. Copilot will then categorize the preference into one of three files: \n.editorconfig for coding standards \nCONTRIBUTING.md for best practices, guidelines, architectural standards, etc. \nand README.md for high level project information \nSo, as you prompt, you’re not only teaching Copilot how to respond better to you in the future, but you’re also helping out your team by documenting your development best practices, and augmenting their future Copilot responses as well! \nPlanning \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\n\nCopilot Chat now includes built-in planning to help guide large, multi-step tasks.  \nWhen you ask a complex question, Copilot automatically creates a markdown plan file with: \nA task list  \nThe files it plans to edit  \nContext for its approach \nAs it works, Copilot updates the plan in real time – tracking progress, adapting to blockers, and keeping its logic transparent. \nPlanning is fully visible, scoped to your goal, and implemented through tool calling, making behavior more predictable, reliable, and easy to follow. \nTry it out: Ask Copilot to refactor a component, add a new feature, or fix bugs across multiple files. \n Plan files are temporary by default. To reuse or share them across threads, save the file into your repo. \nTo learn more about planning or share your feedback, check out the blog post. \nInstruction Files \n\nGetting Copilot to respond the way you want can be a challenge. You may have different coding standards, best practices, or architectural patterns in different areas of your codebase. With instruction files, you can now target specific instructions to specific folders or files in your repository, making Copilot truly project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nEnable the feature \nTurn on the feature at Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat > Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files and added to requests. \nWrite instruction files \nFormat your instructions with the applyTo header and specify a glob pattern for which files you want these instructions to be included for. \n--- \n \napplyTo: \"src/**/*.cs\" \n \n---\nIn the file body, you can use natural language to specify your content and reference other instruction files to compose instructions together.  \nSave the file with the .instructions.md file extension in the root of your repository in the .github/instructions folder. \nTip: You can even get Copilot’s help refining your instructions to be more detailed. \nHow it works \nWhen you prompt Copilot, it will automatically detect which instruction files apply to the files in your current context and attach them as references. You can see which instructions were attached by clicking on the references in the response card. \nBring Your Own Model with Azure Foundry\nWant the ultimate layer of control over which models you’re using in GitHub Copilot Chat? Try out the new Azure Foundry integration to bring your own models.\nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything in Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions. \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Visual Studio October Update – new models, memories, planning, and more appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'USB는 USB지!' 하는 마음이었달까요. 그런데 자세히 살펴보니, 노트북, 자동차, 게임 콘솔, TV 등 우리 주변의 USB 포트들이 겉으로는 비슷해 보여도 실제로는 다 다르다는 걸 알게 됐습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 색깔들이 바로 각 포트가 무엇을 할 수 있는지 정확히 알려주는 비밀스러운 언어였던 거죠. USB 포트의 핵심은 <b>속도와 전력</b>입니다. 어떤 포트는 충전을 위해 더 많은 전력을 공급하도록 설계되었고, 또 어떤 포트는 파일 전송 속도를 최우선으로 하며, 둘의 장점을 적절히 조합한 포트도 있습니다. 아, 그런데 이 사실을 깨닫고 나니 제가 그동안 얼마나 비효율적으로 USB 포트를 사용해왔는지 알 수 있었어요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"blob\" data-origin-width=\"1024\" data-origin-height=\"576\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/kMs0S/dJMcacalgTM/EopKrsHOP0hNKU6zzozmVk/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/kMs0S/dJMcacalgTM/EopKrsHOP0hNKU6zzozmVk/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/kMs0S/dJMcacalgTM/EopKrsHOP0hNKU6zzozmVk/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FkMs0S%2FdJMcacalgTM%2FEopKrsHOP0hNKU6zzozmVk%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"다양한 색상의 USB-A 포트가 나란히 배열된 모습. 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강, 노랑, 하양 포트의 플라스틱 삽입부가 선명하게 보여 기능적 차이를 암시한다.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-filename=\"blob\" data-origin-width=\"1024\" data-origin-height=\"576\"/></span></figure>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이게 왜 중요하냐고요?

        "contentSnippet": "USB 포트의 색깔이 단순한 디자인이라고 생각하셨나요? 사실 각 색상에는 USB 포트의 숨겨진 능력, 즉 데이터 전송 속도와 전력 공급량이 담겨 있습니다. 이 글을 통해 여러분의 기기들이 최적의 성능을 낼 수 있도록 올바른 USB 포트 사용법을 알려드릴게요. 지금 바로 당신의 USB 포트를 확인해보세요!\n\n\n 혹시 여러분은 노트북이나 컴퓨터, 심지어 TV나 자동차에 있는 USB 포트들을 무심코 사용하고 계시지는 않나요? 저도 오랫동안 그랬답니다. 그냥 빈 곳에 아무거나 꽂으면 되는 줄 알았죠. 하지만 USB 기술이 워낙 발전해서 이제는 단순히 ‘꽂으면 된다’고 생각하기에는 놓치는 부분이 너무 많아졌어요.\nUSB-A 포트는 우리 주변 어디에나 존재해요. 노트북, 모니터, TV, 게임 콘솔, 심지어 자동차까지 정말 많은 기기에서 볼 수 있는 흔한 직사각형 커넥터죠. 하지만 시간이 흐르면서 USB-A 포트도 정말 많이 진화했답니다. 그래서 이제는 모든 포트가 다 같은 기능을 하는 게 아니라는 사실! 어떤 포트는 키보드나 마우스 같은 기본적인 주변 기기용으로, 또 다른 포트는 엄청나게 빠른 속도로 데이터를 전송하거나 더 높은 전력을 공급해서 기기를 빠르게 충전할 수 있도록 설계되었어요.\n그렇다고 기기의 사용자 매뉴얼을 일일이 찾아볼 필요는 없어요. 다행히도 많은 USB-A 포트는 어떤 기능을 하는지 시각적인 힌트를 제공하고 있거든요. 바로 포트 안쪽의 플라스틱 삽입 부분 색깔이죠! 일반적으로 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강 또는 노랑 같은 색깔이 포트가 표준인지, 고속인지, 아니면 고전력 충전용인지 알려주는 역할을 합니다. 정말 신기하죠?\n왜 USB 포트 색깔이 중요한가요? 숨겨진 언어를 해독하다!  \n솔직히 저도 대부분의 사람들처럼 USB 포트의 색깔 같은 건 전혀 신경 쓰지 않았어요. 그냥 편하거나 가까운 곳에 아무 기기나 연결했죠. 'USB는 USB지!' 하는 마음이었달까요. 그런데 자세히 살펴보니, 노트북, 자동차, 게임 콘솔, TV 등 우리 주변의 USB 포트들이 겉으로는 비슷해 보여도 실제로는 다 다르다는 걸 알게 됐습니다.\n이 색깔들이 바로 각 포트가 무엇을 할 수 있는지 정확히 알려주는 비밀스러운 언어였던 거죠. USB 포트의 핵심은 속도와 전력입니다. 어떤 포트는 충전을 위해 더 많은 전력을 공급하도록 설계되었고, 또 어떤 포트는 파일 전송 속도를 최우선으로 하며, 둘의 장점을 적절히 조합한 포트도 있습니다. 아, 그런데 이 사실을 깨닫고 나니 제가 그동안 얼마나 비효율적으로 USB 포트를 사용해왔는지 알 수 있었어요.\n\n\n이게 왜 중요하냐고요? 생각보다 큰 차이를 만듭니다. 예를 들어, 잘못된 포트를 사용하면 스마트폰이 충전되는 데 한참 걸리거나, 파일 전송이 끝없이 늘어질 수 있습니다. 외장 하드 드라이브나 USB 메모리를 연결할 때도 마찬가지예요. 부적절한 포트를 사용하면 데이터 전송 시간이 몇 분씩 더 길어질 수 있죠. 꽤 답답한 상황이 벌어질 수 있습니다. 정말로요!\nUSB 포트가 실제로 어떤 기능을 하는지 이해하려면 해당 포트의 버전을 알아야 해요. 하지만 그 모든 정보를 외우거나 매뉴얼을 찾아볼 필요 없이, 포트의 색깔에만 주의를 기울여도 충분합니다. 이 간단한 지식만으로도 각 기기가 필요로 하는 전력이나 속도를 제대로 공급받을 수 있게 할 수 있죠. 제가 이 사실을 깨닫고 나서는, 그냥 아무 데나 꽂던 옛 습관이 얼마나 비효율적이었는지 분명히 알게 되었답니다.\n검정, 파랑, 빨강… USB 포트 색깔별 의미 완전 정복!  \n이제부터 가장 중요한 정보를 알려드릴게요. 우리가 일상에서 가장 흔하게 접하는 USB 포트 색깔은 파랑, 검정, 하양이고, 때로는 빨강이나 노랑 포트도 볼 수 있습니다. 각 색깔이 무엇을 의미하는지 지금부터 자세히 알려드릴게요!\n  알고 계셨나요? USB 버전은 1.1, 2.0, 3.0(3.1 Gen1), 3.1 Gen2, 3.2, 4 등으로 계속 진화하고 있습니다. 숫자가 높을수록 일반적으로 더 빠른 속도와 높은 전력을 제공해요.\n색상\n주요 USB 버전\n주요 특징\n추천 용도\n\n\n\n\n검정 (Black)\nUSB 2.0\n안정적이지만 느린 데이터 전송. 충전 속도는 느린 편.\n키보드, 마우스, 프린터 등 저속 주변 기기\n\n\n파랑 (Blue)\nUSB 3.0 (3.1 Gen 1)\nUSB 2.0보다 최대 10배 빠른 데이터 전송. 보통 수준의 충전 속도.\n외장 하드 드라이브, USB 메모리, 고속 데이터 전송 기기\n\n\n틸 (Teal)\nUSB 3.1 Gen 2 이상\n매우 빠른 데이터 전송과 함께 높은 전력 출력 제공.\n고성능 외장 SSD, VR 헤드셋 등 속도와 전력 모두 중요한 기기\n\n\n빨강/노랑 (Red/Yellow)\n고출력 충전 포트\n컴퓨터 전원이 꺼져 있거나 절전 모드일 때도 전력 공급 (Always-on). 고속 충전 가능.\n스마트폰, 태블릿, 보조배터리 등 전력 소모가 큰 기기 충전\n\n\n하양 (White)\nUSB 1.1 또는 구형\n매우 느린 데이터 전송 속도.\n아주 오래된 주변 기기. 요즘은 거의 보기 어려움.\n\n\n\n여기서 한 가지 알아두실 점이 있습니다. USB 색깔 규격이 모든 브랜드나 모든 기기에 걸쳐 아주 엄격하게 표준화되어 있는 것은 아니라는 사실이죠. 이론적으로는 어떤 제조업체가 USB 1.1 포트에 파란색을 사용할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 대부분의 잘 알려진 브랜드는 위에서 설명한 표준 색상 관례를 따르는 편이에요. 만약 확실하게 알고 싶다면, 사용하시는 기기의 설명서나 제조사 사양을 확인하는 것이 가장 정확합니다.\n이제는 스마트하게! 올바른 포트 사용 전략  \nUSB 포트 색깔이 의미하는 바를 제대로 이해하고 나니, 저의 기기 사용 습관도 완전히 바뀌었어요. 이전에는 그저 아무 데나 꽂았던 것을 이제는 각 기기에 가장 적합한 포트를 찾아 연결하기 시작한 거죠. 솔직히 말하면, 이 작은 변화가 가져온 효율성 향상에 정말 놀랐습니다.\n이제 제 스마트폰은 가능한 한 항상 빨간색이나 노란색 포트에 연결해서 충전합니다. 덕분에 배터리가 훨씬 빠르게 채워져서 더 이상 충전 때문에 애태우는 일이 없어요. 외장 하드 드라이브는 주저 없이 파란색이나 틸색 포트로 직행합니다. 덕분에 파일 백업이나 대용량 파일 전송이 예전보다 훨씬 빨라졌어요. 이전에 겪었던 긴 기다림은 이제 옛말이 되었죠. 키보드와 마우스 같은 경우는 검은색 USB 2.0 포트에도 충분히 잘 작동해서, 더 빠른 포트들은 정말 속도가 필요한 기기들을 위해 아껴둘 수 있게 되었습니다. 이렇게 전략적으로 사용하니, 괜히 느린 포트에 중요한 기기를 꽂아 시간을 낭비할 일이 없어져서 너무 좋아요!\n\n\nUSB-A 포트의 기능을 파악하는 데 색깔이 첫 번째 단서이긴 하지만, 그것이 전부는 아닙니다. 색깔 외에도 USB-A 포트에는 추가 정보를 제공하는 기호들이 종종 있어요. 예를 들어, 'SS' 또는 'SuperSpeed'라는 글자는 빠른 데이터 전송 기능을 의미하며, 때로는 'SS10'처럼 숫자가 함께 표시되어 10Gbps의 USB 3.1 Gen 2 속도를 나타내기도 합니다. 충전 전용 포트의 경우, 번개 모양이나 배터리 아이콘이 함께 표시되어 전력 출력만을 위한 포트임을 알려주기도 하니, 이런 작은 디테일에도 신경을 쓰는 것이 좋겠죠?\n이러한 USB 포트 색깔의 차이를 알게 되면서, 이제 제 기기들을 연결하는 행위는 단순한 습관이 아니라 의도적인 행동이 되었습니다. 이 지식은 단순히 PC를 사용할 때뿐만 아니라, 자동차, TV, 다른 여러 가전제품에 이르기까지 확장되어 모든 기기가 마땅히 받아야 할 최적의 전력과 속도를 누리게 해줍니다. 여러분도 오늘 알려드린 정보를 바탕으로 USB 포트를 더 스마트하게 사용하시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n✔️ USB 포트 색깔은 기능을 나타내는 비밀 코드: 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강/노랑, 하양 등 각 색깔은 데이터 전송 속도와 전력 공급량을 의미합니다.\n✔️ 잘못된 포트 사용은 성능 저하를 초래: 기기 특성에 맞지 않는 포트 사용 시 충전이 느려지거나 파일 전송 시간이 길어질 수 있습니다.\n✔️ 스마트한 매칭으로 효율 극대화: 스마트폰은 고출력(빨강/노랑), 외장하드는 고속(파랑/틸), 키보드/마우스는 표준(검정) 포트에 연결하세요.\n✔️ 색깔 외 추가 표식도 확인: 'SS', 'SuperSpeed' 문구나 번개/배터리 아이콘 등도 포트의 기능을 알려주는 중요한 단서입니다.\n이 정보를 통해 여러분의 디지털 라이프가 한층 더 편리해지기를 바랍니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\nA1: 일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\nQ2: 제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\nA2: 빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ3: USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\nA3: USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다.

Google AI Gemini와 Imagen이 탄생시킨 '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱으로 음식물 쓰레기는 줄이고, 요리의 즐거움은 키워보세요. 당신의 주방이 완전히 새로워집니다.\n\n\n매일 아침, 점심, 저녁. \"오늘 뭐 먹지?\"라는 질문은 우리 삶에서 영원히 끝나지 않을 숙제 같지 않나요? 냉장고 문을 열고 가득한 재료들을 보지만, 정작 뭘 해 먹어야 할지 막막했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 거예요. 결국 배달 앱을 켜면서 '아, 저 재료들 다 어떻게 하지…' 하고 죄책감을 느꼈던 순간들도 많았죠. 이런 우리 모두의 오래된 고민을 시원하게 해결해 줄 아주 특별한 주방 동반자가 드디어 세상에 나왔습니다. 바로 냉장고 사진 한 장으로 잠자고 있던 식재료에 새로운 생명을 불어넣어 주는 AI 요리 비서, '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱입니다.\n솔직히 말하면, 처음 이 아이디어가 생각났을때 '진짜 가능할까?' 하고 반신반의했어요. 하지만 Google의 개발자 지원 프로그램인 'Build with Google AI (바이브코딩)'를 통해 이 놀라운 아이디어가 현실이 되었답니다. 개발자들은 Google AI Studio라는 정말 강력한 웹 기반 도구를 활용해서, 최첨단 AI 모델인 Gemini와 Imagen을 손쉽게 테스트하고 앱에 빠르게 통합할 수 있었죠. 덕분에 복잡하고 어려운 AI 기술이 이제 우리 주방 안으로 쏙 들어와서, 요리 경험 자체를 완전히 바꿔놓을 준비를 마쳤습니다. 2025년, 이제 '오늘 뭐 먹지?' 고민은 이 앱에게 맡겨도 될 것 같아요.\n오늘은 이 혁신적인 앱이 어떻게 우리의 식생활을 혁신하는지, 그 심층적인 기능과 사용법을 저와 함께 자세히 파헤쳐 볼까 합니다. 기대되지 않으세요?\n  '냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 핵심 기능 Deep Dive\n이 앱이 시중에 나와 있는 수많은 레시피 앱들과 차원이 다르다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있는 이유는 바로 AI 기술이 접목된 네 가지 강력한 차별점 때문입니다. 단순히 레시피를 찾아주는 것을 넘어, 요리의 전 과정을 스마트하게 도와주는 진정한 파트너라고 할 수 있죠.\n\n\n① 눈으로 보고 '이해'하는 AI, Gemini\n'냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 가장 핵심적인 강점은 단연 Google의 막강한 멀티모달 AI, Gemini에 있습니다. 사용자가 냉장고 사진을 업로드하면, Gemini는 단순하게 이미지 속에서 형태만 인식하는 것을 넘어, 사진 속 식재료 하나하나를 마치 사람처럼 '이해'하기 시작합니다. 음… 예를 들면, 어지럽게 놓인 채소 더미, 누가 봐도 반쯤 사용한 소스병, 심지어 우유팩의 브랜드까지 식별해서 정확한 재료 목록을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 만들어내죠.\n제가 직접 테스트해 봤는데, 정말 놀랍더군요. 단순히 '채소'라고 인식하는 게 아니라 '시들기 시작한 상추', '반 개 남은 양파' 이런 식으로 상태까지 추론하더라고요! 이게 단순히 재료를 나열하는 것을 넘어서, 각 재료의 신선도나 현재 상태까지 고려해서 가장 최적의, 그리고 창의적인 레시피를 제안하는 기반이 됩니다. 이 부분이 정말 중요한데, 음식물 쓰레기를 줄이는 데 크게 기여할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요.\n② 상상력을 현실로, Imagen으로 보는 완성 요리\n\"이 레시피, 과연 맛있어 보일까?\" 요리 초보자든 베테랑이든, 이 질문은 요리에 대한 동기를 부여하는 아주 중요한 요소일 겁니다. 솔직히 글로만 된 레시피로는 감이 잘 안 올 때가 많잖아요?

ISA 계좌나 연금 계좌에서도 투자할 수 있는 국내 투자운용사의 금현물 ETF 등은 투자가 쉬우면서 인플레이션 방어 역할을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n(3) 대출금 상환 우선순위 설정하기\n금리가 내려가면 대출 이자가 줄어들어 숨통이 트일 수 있지만, 부채가 많다면 우선 갚는 게 최선입니다. 특히 금리가 높은 신용대출 상환은 최우선순위로 둬야 하고요. 금리가 오를 때는 변동금리 대출의 부담이 커지므로, 저금리 시기에 미리 갚거나 고정금리로 바꿔두는 게 안전합니다. 매달 일정 비율을 정해 꾸준히 상환하고, 보너스나 여윳돈이 생기면 추가로 갚아나가면 부채 관리가 조금 더 수월해질 수 있어요.\n물가와 금리는 서로 맞물리며 경제의 큰 균형을 만들어 갑니다. 금리가 오르고 내리는 과정은 결국 과열을 식히고, 또 침체를 막으며 경제가 스스로 균형을 찾아가는 흐름이 반복되는 거예요. 그 안에서 우리는 때론 불안에 떨고, 때론 기회를 기대하기도 합니다. 투자자로서 이 파도 같은 변동성에 휩쓸리지 않으려면 길게 보는 안목과 인내심을 가져야 합니다. 그리고 자산을 분산 투자하고, 주기적인 리밸런싱을 통해 포트폴리오를 점검하며 시장의 흐름에 유연하게 대응하는 게 중요합니다. 이렇게 하면 금리와 물가의 파동 속에서도 자산을 지켜내고 성장시킬 수 있습니다.\n경제는 늘 변하지만, 물가와 금리가 가리키는 신호를 이해하면 변동성은 두려움의 대상이 아니라 기회의 신호입니다. 우리가 경제를 공부하는 건 이 거대한 흐름 속에서 흔들리지 않고 내 자산을 지키기 위한 것이라는 점을 기억하세요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 이제현",
