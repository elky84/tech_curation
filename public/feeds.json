This update is based on your feedback and focuses on improving code blocks, but there is more! Thank you all for sharing your ideas. It’s a pleasure to keep improving our product for you.\nDownload Writerside\n                                    \nCode samples in documentation: Stick to the basics\nWhen I first started thinking about presenting code samples in technical documentation, the initial idea was about advanced features, like interactivity, robust linking between text and code, and sophisticated presentation options, such as substituting placeholders on the fly. \nHowever, the recent Unconference session at the Write The Docs Atlantic conference revealed something surprising – the most pressing concerns regarding code blocks weren’t about cutting-edge features, but about getting the fundamentals right.\n\n\n\n\nReality check: Know your audience\nAt the conference, the discussion quickly shifted from “How can we make our code samples more interactive?” to “What does our audience actually need?” This pivot highlighted a fundamental truth in technical writing: understanding your readers’ goals is more important than implementing cutting-edge features.\nThe 4 key insights regarding code blocks\nContext and purpose\nIt’s not about “short” versus “long” code samples – what matters is context and purpose. Tutorials need complete, real-world examples. API docs benefit from focused code blocks that demonstrate specific functionality. \nCopy-paste is the reality \nThere’s no way around it – regardless of experience level, people consistently copy and paste code samples. We can’t fight it, but we can use code blocks that are complete enough to work even when directly copy-pasted, or that indicate what to do to make them work. \nAs Chris Chinchilla points out in “Technical Writing for Software Development”, developers frequently copy and paste a series of code snippets into an editor because it’s a fundamental part of learning.\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent strokes for different folks\nCode samples serve as learning material, and, like any other learning resource, one size does not fit all – different learning styles call for different examples. Beginners might need step-by-step breakdowns, while expert developers might prefer more comprehensive examples that they can tweak to fit their own needs without much hassle.\nComplementary tools\nSwagger specs and Postman collections are great companions to documentation, but not replacements. They help users move from learning to doing, once the concepts are clear.\nCode block maintenance: The hidden challenge\nAs products evolve, keeping code samples up to date is crucial – and challenging.\nHow can you efficiently update examples across documentation?\nWhen should you remove or deprecate outdated examples?\nWhat are the best strategies for version management?\nThese challenges aren’t new to us at JetBrains. We’ve explored several automation strategies in our previous post about keeping documentation up to date. Building on those insights, we’re now focusing on code sample maintenance.\nChris Chinchilla, in his recent book, outlines two approaches to documentation testing:\nManual testing: Writers regularly verify examples from a newcomer’s perspective.\nAutomated testing: Tests are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for continuous verification.\n\n\n\n\nAnother approach, called Docs as Tests, is being actively explored by Manny Silva. We highly recommend checking out both Chris’s book and Manny’s project for further inspiration.\nAs we continue to evolve Writerside’s code sample capabilities, we’re keeping this lesson in mind: the best features aren’t always the flashiest – they’re the ones that help writers meet their readers’ needs, whoever those readers may be.\nNew in Writerside EAP 9: Code block enhancements\nThe latest Writerside release focuses on practical improvements that directly address common challenges with code blocks:\nExternal code block references provides a single source of truth for code samples, reducing maintenance overhead.\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced language support ensures accurate syntax highlighting across more programming languages.\n\n\n\n\nNative support for .puml and .mermaid files streamlines the integration of diagrams with code samples.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with code samples? Help us stay up to date\nWe’ve learned that the best documentation improvements come from understanding real-world needs. Have you faced challenges with code samples in documentation? Which features make a difference in your daily work? \nWhether you’re a technical writer crafting examples or a software developer, we’d love to hear your perspective. Join the conversation in our Slack community and help shape the future of code samples in Writerside.\nJoin our Slack community 🤓\n                                    \nBut wait, there are more features and improvements!\nWriterside EAP 9 offers more than just improved code blocks:\nPDF CLI: Our builder can now produce PDFs alongside the web output.\nThe Good Docs integration: We’ve improved our recent integration of The Good Docs project templates.\nAPI documentation generation: You can now generate API docs as a new instance.\nTable of contents: This long-awaited feature provides a table of contents for topics with API docs.\nMulti-specification support: Generate documentation from multiple specification files.\n\n\n\n\n👉 Read the full release notes\nWe hope you like the new features.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR:\nIn this post, I walk through the process of enhancing a chatbot project from Hyperskill by adding a web interface with Flask, JavaScript, and HTML. I tried out JetBrains AI Assistant and documented how it helped me with common coding tasks like installing frameworks, debugging, and generating code snippets, streamlining my development workflow. \nFrom CLI to web UI: Exploring generative AI with Hyperskill\nWhile searching for new generative AI coding challenges, I came across the Simple Python CLI Chat project on Hyperskill, which teaches the basics of working with a generative AI API through the process of creating a basic chat assistant. The project was engaging, but I wanted to add an extra challenge by building a web interface to interact with the chat assistant in a more user-friendly way. After a bit of research, I decided to go with a setup that used Flask, JavaScript, and HTML. I already had experience with Flask from Hyperskill’s Python Backend Developer track, but my JavaScript knowledge from university was a bit rusty – that motivated me to look for tools that could help fill in the gaps.\n\n\n\n\nGetting started with JetBrains AI Assistant\nA colleague shared his experience using JetBrains AI Assistant to convert code from Kotlin to Python. Inspired, I decided to try it out myself and document my experience here. First, I cloned my Hyperskill project from GitHub and installed the JetBrains AI Assistant plugin through the AI Assistant tab. Installation went smoothly, and after restarting my IDE, I was ready to dive in.\n\n\n\n\nMultilingual feature test: Trying out Dutch\nAs soon as I started, AI Assistant asked if I wanted to receive responses in a custom language. Living and working in the Netherlands, I’m currently learning Dutch, so I switched the response language to Dutch to test out the multilingual capabilities. \nLong story short: it worked flawlessly! I later switched back to English, as my Dutch still has some room for improvement, but the feature left an impression. It made me think how useful it could be in multilingual work environments, especially here in Amsterdam, where developers often juggle multiple languages. With setup complete, I was ready to dive into my project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEasy Flask installation with JetBrains AI\nTo test out AI Assistant, I asked it how to install Flask. It recommended running the pip install Flask command, which I could execute directly in the terminal with a single click on Run Snippet. This quick execution feature saved time and was super convenient.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the frontend: JavaScript and HTML\nWith Flask installed, I moved on to creating the frontend. I started with a JavaScript file for handling user inputs, server interactions, and keeping the UI updated, and an HTML file for structuring a simple chat interface. But before diving into these details, I had to transform my Hyperskill project into a working Flask app to act as a basic web server.\nSetting up the Flask server for AI communication\nTo start, I initialized a basic Flask app and created a route to handle POST requests from the chat interface. This route captured the user’s message, processed it, and returned a JSON response containing the AI’s reply. I also added error handling to ensure the server could respond with clear error messages. \nDebugging and fixing errors with AI Assistant\nAfter setting up the basic server, I ran it locally to make sure everything worked as expected. I encountered an error, so I used AI Assistant’s Explain with AI option, and within seconds, it suggested a solution, including a code snippet. By clicking Insert Snippet at Caret, I applied the fix, and my server finally started up! With this first hurdle cleared, I was able to move on to refining the JavaScript and HTML files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a dynamic chat with the real-time Fetch API\nIn the JavaScript file, I wanted to ensure that messages could be fetched and displayed in real time, without the need for page reloads. Back in university, I would have achieved this with AJAX. But since that was nearly a decade ago, this time I opted for the more modern Fetch API. As I typed, AI Assistant offered code completion suggestions, which were especially useful for building a new file from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLetting AI generate HTML: A little experiment\nWhen it came time to set up the HTML layout, I decided to let AI Assistant generate the initial structure for me. The result needed tweaking (for example, the Send button wasn’t functional and the layout wasn’t ideal), but it saved me a lot of time. While AI is great for generating code, it’s important to have enough knowledge to adjust and refine the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaunching the web app and… getting hungry!\nAfter some final adjustments, my web app was ready. I launched it, and everything worked seamlessly! But by this point, I was starving. As a lighthearted test, I asked the chatbot to give me a recipe for my favorite pasta, cacio e pepe – and it delivered! Having a functional AI chatbot and a pasta recipe felt like a win-win.\n\n\n\n\nCommitting code with AI’s help\nWith my app up and running, it was time to commit and push my changes to GitHub. AI Assistant even helped generate a commit message. While it was a bit too detailed, I kept the essential parts, which added a nice finishing touch to my coding session.\n\n\n\n\nDiscovering AI Assistant’s full range of features\nCurious to see what else the assistant could do, I explored the Options I Discover Features section. There’s a wealth of capabilities here to streamline the coding process, from multi-language support to debugging assistance and documentation generation.\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts: AI as a coding companion\nJetBrains AI Assistant proved to be a powerful tool throughout this project. It helped me accomplish key tasks like installing frameworks, troubleshooting server errors, generating code snippets, and even suggesting commit messages – all of which streamlined my workflow and saved time. Experimenting with its multilingual support also gave me insight into its flexibility for developers in diverse work environments.\nFor developers in multilingual or fast-paced settings, tools like AI Assistant can make a big difference. However, its effectiveness ultimately increases when paired with foundational coding knowledge. My advice to new programmers is this: try fixing errors independently before relying on AI. Doing so will sharpen your problem-solving skills and help you get the most out of AI assistance when you need it.\nThanks for joining me on this coding journey! Hopefully, this post inspires you to give JetBrains AI Assistant a try in your own projects. Explore its features, experiment, and make coding a little more fun. And don’t forget to reward yourself with some delicious pasta afterward!\nTill next time!",

        "pubDate": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:06:26 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Recently, we announced the public rollout of the Fleet Plugins SDK – a step that finally allows plugins to be created and shared among the Fleet community at large.\nBelieve it or not, this did not mark the very beginning of extensibility in Fleet. Fleet has always featured a variety of bundled plugins (currently upwards of 50!) to streamline your coding process.\nWe designed Fleet to be minimalist and focus on the essentials of programming so that you can avoid extension fatigue. Does this mean Fleet users should shy away from plugins? Of course not! We’re still working on finalizing Fleet’s extensibility program, but you can already make use of its existing bundled plugins.\nThese plugins can be selectively added to and removed from your Fleet workspace, or even marked as required for a given workspace. Here’s a quick rundown of how you can manage bundled plugins in Fleet.\nFleet’s default set of bundled plugins can be roughly broken down into the following categories:\nIntegrated tools and frameworks\nAI features\nLanguage-specific support\nCustomization\nRemote development\nIntegrated Tools and Frameworks\nFleet comes bundled with plugins supporting a plethora of integrated tools and frameworks, including Amper, Docker, Git, Gradle, Maven, and a whole host of others. Here’s the full list at a glance:\n\n\n\n\nWorthy of special mention is Amper, a JetBrains tool designed to provide a smoother experience with project configuration and toolability when working with Kotlin Multiplatform.\nMany of these plugins will require you to have Smart Mode running, but there are some (such as Prettier) that you can use even when running Fleet as a lightweight text editor.\nPlugins Supporting AI Features\nHere’s a quick glance at all the languages for which AI plugins are offered in Fleet by default. Keep in mind that this is just the beginning – we’ve got plenty of additional features on the way for even more languages.\n\n\n\n\nThis is in addition to Fleet’s support for AI Completion and Grazie – JetBrains’ AI writing companion for smoothing out your grammar and style.\nIf you want to give Fleet’s AI features a try, go ahead and request an AI Pro trial (free of charge for seven days).\nLanguage Support\nFrom a language standpoint, Fleet has always been highly versatile. It supports most major languages straight out of the box – no matter how simple or in-depth your project may be. Fleet analyzes your code to automatically detect your project configuration, including which language you’re coding in.\nTo get the most out of each language when Smart Mode is enabled (such as code completion, error detection, documentation, code reformatting, and navigation to usages and definitions), you can make use of pre-installed plugins for any the following languages:\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nThe Fleet user experience is becoming ever more customizable. Members of the Fleet community can publish custom color theme plugins, but there are a few bundled plugins for this as well. The Grey Theme comes pre-installed, for instance, allowing you to tweak the look and feel of Fleet.\nFleet’s potential for customization does not stop at mere aesthetics. If you happen to be migrating from VSCode, the VSCode Keymap plugin will let you stick to the shortcuts you’re used to. As of the 1.41 release, Fleet gives you even more keymap options, including IntelliJ IDEA Classic, Emacs, Sublime Text, and Eclipse.\nThose who want to take things a step further with custom language support can use the TextMate plugin. This plugin makes it possible to add TextMate bundles – for example, in cases where you need code highlighting while Smart Mode is off or while coding in a language that isn’t supported in Fleet.\nRemote Development\nFleet has built-in support for remote development. When you’re on the go, you can use your local machine as a thin client while letting a more powerful machine at your home or office handle more resource-intensive tasks.\nFleet provides this out of the box, in contrast to VS Code, which requires you to install and configure extensions before you can use remote development features.\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to add more to Fleet’s expandability program.",

Below is a brief overview of the major features and bug fixes that will be included in CLion 2024.3 and are already available in Beta.\nThe key features\nThroughout the 2024.3 EAP, we’ve added a variety of features for CLion Nova, embedded\ndevelopment, debugging, and more. Here are the most important ones.\nCLion Nova\nSome editor-related features, such as the call hierarchy, the gutter icon for recursive calls, and the Quick Definition popup have improved the user experience when working with CLion Nova.\nThe IDE frontend and backend improvements have significantly reduced CLion Nova’s memory footprint. This is particularly evident when handling large projects like Chromium.\nPredefined code styles from other projects allow you to choose from LLVM, Google, Qt, GNU, and more.\nEmbedded development\nThe Debug Servers configuration option helps you streamline the process of configuring debugging for embedded and remote development.\nSupport for debugging Zephyr West applications makes it easy to configure and run West debugging sessions directly in the IDE.\nEditable peripheral register values allow you to test different configurations and device states during debugging sessions without recompiling your source code or reloading your application or board.\nCLion’s static analysis toolset now includes a significant number of MISRA C++: 2023 checks, offering recommendations for using C++17 in safety-critical systems.\nDebugger\nWith the OpenCV image viewer, you can now view a two-dimensional OpenCV array as an image while debugging. Such an image is displayed in a separate dialog with various editing options.\nThe ability to attach the debugger to an unstarted process is helpful when you need to debug an executable launched by a third-party program or a script.\nYou can now view strings with JSON, XML, or HTML data formatted according to their code style directly in the debugger.\nOther features\nUpdated cloud completion powered by JetBrains AI Assistant now offers a wider range of usage scenarios and improved multiline code suggestions.\nProject status notifications have been moved from the top of the editor to a new widget in the status bar, making them less distracting.\nIf you’re just starting with CLion, you’ll notice the improved onboarding tips, which give you a clearer picture of the IDE’s capabilities right from the start.\nThe key bug fixes\nHere are the major bug fixes that we’ve included in CLion 2024.3 Beta:\nWhen a board is not defined for a new Zephyr West project or a West executable path is incorrect, CLion now warns you of the problem and offers to fix it. You’ll get a link that will take you to the corresponding section of your project settings, where you can define the board or path.\nThe Refresh button in the Call Hierarchy tool window now works as intended when the actual call hierarchy in the source code has been changed.\nAI Assistant again highlights C/C++ code in the chat when you ask it to explain code or suggest a refactoring, for example.\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 BETA\nYour CLion team\nJetBrains\nThe Drive to Develop",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2024/11/unreal-engine-plugin-ugs-integration-and-open-sourcing/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:44:18 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve got a few exciting updates about the Unreal Engine plugin announced in the previous blog post. \nTL;DR – we’re adding Unreal Game Sync (UGS) integration and open-sourcing the plugin. These updates are all about making the CI/CD experience smoother for Unreal Engine devs and getting the community more involved.\nUGS\nBefore diving in, let’s quickly go over what Unreal Game Sync (UGS) is for anyone who might not be familiar with it or could use a refresher. In essence, UGS is a lightweight UI for Perforce. Typically, you need to build it from source to get started, and while its graphical client is a WinForms application available only on Windows, there is a command-line interface (CLI) version for other platforms. UGS has been around for a while and is widely used by game studios working with Unreal Engine as a collaboration tool.\nFrom a CI/CD perspective, UGS provides valuable insights into a project’s status (if properly set up), such as build statuses, the ability to flag specific changelists as problematic, and more. To give a better overview, here’s a rough diagram of the components involved:\n\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few components here, with the central one being the Metadata Server. While deploying it isn’t strictly necessary, it does enable the full feature set of UGS. This is also where CI/CD systems post build information. As shown, there are different possible implementations of the Metadata Server, and it’s worth briefly discussing each:\nEpic Metadata Service. This is the original and longest-standing version of the Metadata Server. It requires Windows, IIS, and the older .NET Framework 4.6.2.\nThird-party implementation. Thanks to the open-source nature of the server, it’s possible to create your own implementation. One example is RUGS, which is much easier to set up since it supports Docker.\nHorde. Technically, this is a full-fledged automation platform recently introduced by Epic. It includes a built-in UGS Metadata Server as well as its own build system. Although it has a built-in metadata server, it doesn’t allow publishing from external sources – the transition to Horde assumes that all metadata is generated internally. Horde is a bit outside the scope of this blog post, so we’re only mentioning it for the sake of completeness.\nEntities that the build system is supposed to post to the metadata server are called “badges” in UGS terms. These badges will then show up in the CIS (continuous integration status) column in UGS. It usually looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nAs far as we know, the metadata server endpoints don’t currently have authentication. It appears that the server is intended to be used within a secure, closed network, but this is just our understanding and not an official statement.\nFor a more complete definition of UGS please refer to the official documentation.\nUGS Integration in TeamCity\nLet’s take a look at UGS integration in TeamCity. As of the most recent plugin update, we support these two scenarios:\nPublishing a badge as a build status via the Commit Status Publisher.\nPublishing an arbitrary set of badges defined in your BuildGraph script.\nThis applies to the “distributed” execution mode – a special runner mode in which the BuildGraph definition of the build is converted into a set of builds in TeamCity (build chain). For more details, please refer to our previous blog post or the plugin documentation.\nThe first scenario is pretty straightforward. You only need to configure the Commit Status Publisher build feature and set up a few required parameters.\n\n\n\n\nThe second scenario is more complex. In your script, you can define a set of badges and link them to specific nodes to be tracked. Before diving into the scripts, here’s a quick reminder of how the plugin maps BuildGraph entities to TeamCity entities:\n\nBuildGraphTeamCity\nNodeBuild step\nAgentBuild\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if your build process includes compiling an editor, the script might look like this (with unimportant details omitted):\n<Agent Name=\"Build Editor and tools\" Type=\"...\">\n    <Node Name=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Tools\" Requires=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Editor\" Requires=\"Compile Tools\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"Compile Editor\" Project=\"//UE5/Main/Samples/Games/Lyra\" Requires=\"Compile Editor\"/>\nHere, we define a badge named “Compile Editor” to track the execution of a node with the same name. In distributed BuildGraph mode, TeamCity will recognize this badge and update the build status as the process progresses.\nYou can define multiple badges to track different sets of nodes, and TeamCity will monitor all of them based on the specified dependencies:\n<Agent Name=\"Build A\" Type=\"A\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 1\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build B\" Type=\"B\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 2\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build C\" Type=\"C\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 3\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"BuildProject\" Project=\"//foo/bar/project\" Requires=\"Node A;Node B;Node C\"/>\nIn this example, there are three agents (each with a single node) that can potentially run concurrently, as they are assigned to different agents and have no dependencies on each other. Each build is tracked by a corresponding badge.\nThe badge will behave as follows:\n“Starting” – displayed as soon as any tracked dependency begins execution.\n“Success” – shown when all dependencies complete successfully.\n“Failure” – Indicated if any dependency encounters an error.\nFor complete examples, please refer to the plugin’s user guide on GitHub.\nOpen-sourcing the Plugin\nWe have received a lot of feedback since the plugin was introduced in May this year. Thank you to everyone who shared ideas for further development, submitted feature requests, or reported bugs! We’ve also been asked several times whether we’re going to open-source the plugin and, if so, when. That time is now!\nWith this step, we hope to:\nIncrease transparency and trust in the plugin’s codebase.\nEngage the community for contributions and improvements.\nSpeed up bug fixes and feature implementations.\nThe source code is now available on GitHub and the latest release is ready for download on the marketplace. We encourage you to submit feature requests, report any bugs you encounter, suggest enhancements, or fork the plugin and customize it to fit your needs.\nCheers!",

With this release, we’ve improved the IDE experience when working with multiple modules and project.yaml files, made nested completion in Amper configuration files more powerful, introduced support for Compose Resources and KSP2, improved Android release builds, and more!\nFor the full list of changes and bug fixes in Amper 0.5.0, see the release notes.\nTo get support for Amper’s latest features, use Fleet 1.42 or IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTooling support for working with modules and project files\nIn the previous update, we introduced project files for standalone Amper projects. With this release, you’ll now get additional tooling to work with these files.\nWhen working in the configuration file of a newly created module, you’ll see a warning and a quick-fix that helps you add it to the list of modules:\n\n\n\n\nWhen referencing a module that doesn’t exist yet, you can use a quick-fix to create that new module:\n\n\n\n\nImproved nested completion\nThe settings block in Amper files offers nested completion for all of the available values you can configure, letting you easily search for values even if you don’t know where in the structure they’re nested.\nTo make this even more convenient, you’ll now get this completion support even when you’re at the top level of a module file:\n\n\n\n\nCompose resources\nYou can now use Compose Multiplatform resources in standalone Amper projects, which allows you to easily access images, strings, fonts, and files in your Compose application.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure resources under settings.compose to change the package name or the visibility of the generated Res class:\nsettings:\n  compose:\n    enabled: true\n    resources:\n      packageName: com.example.app\n      exposedAccessors: true\nKotlin Symbol Processing\nThe standalone version of Amper now has support for Kotlin Symbol Processing. Many third-party libraries use KSP to generate code as part of the compilation process.\nAmper works with KSP2, so any processors used must be updated for KSP2 as well. We’re expecting most processors to make this upgrade soon, as KSP1 is deprecated and will no longer be supported in Kotlin 2.1. However, at the time of this release, you might still see some gaps in support, such as issues with native targets.\nTo add a processor to your module, use the settings.kotlin.ksp section. You can also specify the options that you want to pass to KSP here.\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\n      processorOptions:\n        room.schemaLocation: ./schema\nIn multiplatform modules, configuration in the settings block is applied to all platforms by default, including KSP processors. If you need to specify which platforms to run a KSP processor on, use a settings block with a platform qualifier:\nsettings@android:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\nAndroid release builds\nAmper can now create signed release builds of Android apps in both Gradle-based and standalone Amper projects. These builds will use R8 automatically, with minification and shrinking enabled.\nTo enable signing for release builds, use the new android.signing option in the settings block:\nsettings:\n  android:\n    signing: enabled\nYou can provide the signing details by creating a keystore.properties file in the module:\nstoreFile=/Users/example/.keystores/release.keystore\nstorePassword=store_password\nkeyAlias=alias\nkeyPassword=key_password\nThere are options available to customize R8’s obfuscation and to change the location of the properties file containing the signing details. Amper can also generate a new keystore for you if you don’t have one already.\nYou can refer to the documentation about configuring Android builds for more details, and you can also look at samples to see custom Proguard configuration in both standalone and Gradle-based Amper projects.\nParcelize support for Android\nIn projects using the standalone version of Amper, you can now turn on the Parcelize plugin for Android, using the new settings entry: \nsettings:\n  android:\n    parcelize: enabled\nThis lets you annotate Parcelable classes with @Parcelize to generate an implementation automatically:\nimport kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize\n\n@Parcelize\nclass User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable\nAs Parcelize is an Android-specific feature, it requires some additional configuration in multiplatform projects, which is described in the documentation.\nUpdated dependencies and defaults\nAmper now uses these new versions of dependencies and default values:\nKotlin 2.0.20\nKotlin language version 2.0\nAndroid Gradle Plugin 8.5.0\nAndroid compile SDK and target SDK 35\nThis release also uses kotlinx.serialization 1.7.3 by default and allows you to customize this version if needed:\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    serialization:\n      enabled: true\n      version: 1.7.3\nTo make it easier to set up serialization for various formats, the required dependencies are available from the built-in version catalog:\ndependencies:\n  - $kotlin.serialization.json\n  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf\nNew, unified cache folder\nThere is now a unified location for caching downloaded dependencies, whether Amper is invoked from the command line or used in an IDE. The ~/.amper folder that was used in previous versions can be safely deleted.\nThe new cache locations are as follows:\nOn Windows: ~/AppData/Local/Amper\nOn macOS: ~/Library/Caches/Amper\nOn Linux: ~/.cache/Amper (or if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined, $XDG_CACHE_HOME/.cache/Amper) \nUpdate your existing projects\nTo update a project using the standalone version of Amper, update your amper scripts by following the download instructions on the Usage page of the documentation.\nIf you’re using a Gradle-based Amper project, update your plugin version to 0.5.0:\nplugins {\n   id(\"org.jetbrains.amper.settings.plugin\").version(\"0.5.0\")\n}\nTry Amper\nTo get started with Amper, try the sample projects with standalone Amper or the samples with Gradle-based projects.\nFor full support of the latest Amper features, use Fleet 1.42 and IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTry Amper\n                                                    \nShare your feedback\nAmper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a YouTrack issue. Your input and your use cases help shape the future of Amper!",

We offer practical tutorials to enhance your skills, a curated list of November’s top tech events, both online and offline, and an exclusive feature by industry expert Mala Gupta.\nStay informed, and stay ahead!\nFeatured Content \nJava Developer Advocate with JetBrains, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Mala Gupta has authored multiple books with Manning, Packt, and O’Reilly Publications. She has more than two decades of experience in the software industry and is a regular speaker at industry conferences around the world. She is a vocal supporter of Java certification as a path to career advancement.\nIn this featured section, I want to highlight ‘JEP Explained‘ – a collection of heartfelt conversations with the Java architects and experts who helped bring Java 23 features to life. These conversations dive into JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), which are the key features planned for each JDK release. Our hope with this series is to help developers, teams, and anyone passionate about Java not just understand the new Java features, but to look beyond the syntax and dig into the bigger picture with behind-the-scenes stories and the experiences of experts. Here’s the link to the blog post and YouTube playlist.\nJava 23, released in September 2024, has twelve JEPs, and the ‘JEP Explained’ series covers eleven of them. Each conversation packs a bunch of information beyond the JEP itself. For instance, when we talked with Brian Goetz about JEP 455 (about the addition of primitive types to pattern matching), he also talked about balancing new features and complexity in software development, why compiler writers love pattern matching, how designing a feature is often a lesson in humility, and how the evolution of design is an organic process. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the complete interview for more insights from Brian, Aggelos Biboudis, and Tagir Valeev, as they all discuss the inclusion of primitive types in pattern matching.\n99% of developers I talked with believe that one of the reasons for deprecating an API in Java is the availability of better APIs. Ron Pressler stated this is never the case, when we talked with him about JEP 471 (deprecation of Memory-Access Methods in the sun.misc.Unsafe class). Ron also talked about ‘Tip and Tail: a smarter way to manage codebases for different JDKs’, whether folks are swimming naked when they use outdated code, the real secret to performance gains, and much more. Check out this conversation with Ron for more insights.\nWe had another interesting conversation with Viktor Klang and Tagir Valeev about Stream Gatherers in the Streams API. Apart from discussing JEP 473, Viktor touched on topics such as ‘The Power of Simplicity in Software Design’ and how bugs can’t hide in simplicity. He shared how the built-in gatherers can inspire folks, show what this feature can do, help them to get started using them, and then help them create custom gatherers. Viktor also shared why he loves to use JShell for prototyping. Tagir shared that the most complex code that he has ever written was for a Stream API library that he created, streamex. Check out the full interview for more stories.\nIt was a pleasure to talk about being able to use Markdown for writing documentation comments in JavaDoc with Jonathan Gibbons, owner of JEP 467, and Dmitry Chuyko. Jonathan talked about making Java more approachable by simplifying its documentation with Markdown. He discussed why Markdown is a game changer for JavaDoc and addressed which Markdown flavor to use. Dmitry talked about a challenge related to documentation at work – what happens when the documentation of a codebase is larger than its codebase? Check out the full interview here.\nIt was an honor and a privilege to interview all of these Java architects and experts for the JEP Explained interview series: Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, Ken Fogel, Rafael Winterhalter, José Paumard, Zoran Sevarac, Monica Beckwith, Paul Bakker, and Gavin Bierman.\nThough I would have loved to, it is not feasible to highlight all of the fantastic “aha!” moments and learning I experienced while talking with all the guests.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "How Airbnb leverages machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to solve a unique information retrieval task in order to provide guests with unique, affordable, and differentiated accommodations around the world.\nBy: Dillon Davis, Huiji Gao, Thomas Legrand, Weiwei Guo, Malay Haldar, Alex Deng, Han Zhao, Liwei He, Sanjeev Katariya\nIntroduction\nAirbnb has transformed the way people travel around the globe. As Airbnb’s inventory spans diverse locations and property types, providing guests with relevant options in their search results has become increasingly complex. In this blog post, we’ll discuss shifting from using simple heuristics to advanced machine learning and reinforcement learning techniques to transform what we call location retrieval in order to address this challenge.\nThe Challenge of Location Retrieval\nGuests typically start searching by entering a destination in the search bar and expect the most relevant results to be surfaced. These destinations can be countries, states, cities, neighborhoods, streets, addresses, or points of interest. Unlike traditional travel accommodations, Airbnb listings are spread across different neighborhoods and surrounding areas. For example, a family searching for a vacation rental in San Francisco might find better options in nearby cities like Daly City, where there are larger single-family homes. Thus, the system needs to account for not just the searched location but also nearby areas that might offer better options for the guest. This is evidenced by the locations of booked listings when searching for San Francisco shown below.\n\nGiven Airbnb’s scale, we cannot rank every listing for every search. This presented a challenge to create a system that dynamically infers a relevant map area for a query. This system, known as location retrieval, needed to balance including a wide variety of listings to appeal to all guests’ needs while still being relevant to the query. Our search ranking models can then efficiently rank the subset of our inventory that is within the relevant map area and surface the most relevant inventory to our guests. This system and more is outlined below\n\nStarting with Heuristics: The Cold Start Problem\nInitially, Airbnb relied on heuristics to define map areas based on the type of search. For example, if a guest searched for a country, the system would use administrative boundaries to filter listings within that country. If they searched for a city, the system would create a 25-mile radius around the city center to retrieve listings.\nImproving these heuristics proved to be profoundly impactful. One such example is the introduction of a log scale parameterized smooth function to compute an expansion factor for the diagonal size of the administrative bounds of the searched destination. We applied this for very precise locations like addresses, buildings, and POI’s resulting in a 0.35% increase in uncancelled bookers on the platform when tested in an online A/B experiment against the baseline heuristics. Figures below demonstrate how search results for a building in Ibiza, Spain improved dramatically with this heuristic by surfacing significantly more and higher quality inventory.\n\nThese heuristics were simple and worked well enough to start, but they had limitations. They couldn’t differentiate between different types of searches (e.g., a family looking for a large home versus a solo traveler looking for a small apartment), and they didn’t adapt well to new data as Airbnb’s inventory and guest preferences evolved.\nExploring Statistics to Help Improve Location Retrieval\nWith more data available over time from these intuition based heuristics, we thought there might be a way to take advantage of this historical user booking behavior to improve location retrieval. We built a dataset for each travel destination that recorded where guests booked listings when searching for that destination. Based on this data, the system could create retrieval map areas that included 96% of the nearest booked listings for a given destination.\nWe tested these newly constructed retrieval map areas in lieu of the intuition based heuristics outlined above based on the hypothesis that it would provide guests a more bookable selection of inventory. While this statistical approach was more aligned with guest booking behavior, it still had limitations. It treated all searches for a location the same, regardless of specific search parameters like group size or travel dates. This uniform approach meant that some guests might not see the best listings for their particular needs. As a result, this statistics based method had no detectable increase in uncancelled bookers on the platform when tested against the heuristics outlined above in an online A/B experiment. This led us to believe that location retrieval may require more advanced techniques such as machine learning.\nAdvancing to Machine Learning\nInstead of only relying on past booking data, the new system could learn from various search parameters, such as the number of guests and stay duration. By analyzing this data, a model could predict more relevant map areas for each search, rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach.\nFor example, a group of ten travelers searching for a San Francisco vacation rental might prefer larger homes in the suburbs, while solo travelers might prioritize central locations. The machine learning model could distinguish between these different preferences and adjust the retrieval map areas accordingly, providing more tailored results.\nWe constructed our machine learning model in the following manner. This is a result of three iterations that introduced the machine learning model, expanded its feature set, and expanded search attribution. The architecture is depicted in the figure below.\n\nTraining Examples: Searches issued by a booker by entering a destination in the search bar or manipulating the map that contained the booked listing in their search results on the same day or one day before the booking. We discard any bookings that are canceled 7 days after booking.\nTraining Features: We derive features directly from the search request such as location name, stay length, number of guests, price filters, location country, etc. There are 9 continuous features and 19 categorical features in total.\nTraining Labels: The latitude and longitude coordinates of the booked listing attributed to the search\nArchitecture: A two layer neural network of size 256 was chosen in order to have more flexibility for loss formulation compared to traditional regression and decision tree based approaches.\nModel Output: 4 floats that define the latitude and longitude offsets from the center latitude and longitude coordinates of the searched destination that represent the relevant map area.\nLoss: Trained to predict map areas that contain their associated booked listing while minimizing the size of the predicted map area and the occurrence of predictions that cannot construct a valid rectangular map area.\n\nThe machine learning system increased the recall of booked listings (i.e., how often the system retrieved a listing that was eventually booked) by 7.12% and reduced the size of the retrieval map area by 40.83%. It had a cumulative impact of +1.8% in uncancelled bookers on the platform. The initial model was evaluated against the baseline and each subsequent model iteration was evaluated against the preceding outgoing model.\nFigures below demonstrate how search results for a specific street in Lima, Peru improved dramatically with the model by surfacing results that are much closer to the searched street.\nBefore\n\nAfter\n\nExploring New Frontiers with Reinforcement Learning\nWhile machine learning improved the system’s ability to differentiate search results, there was still room for improvement, particularly in learning whether locations that had never been surfaced before were relevant to guests for a search. To address this, Airbnb introduced reinforcement learning to the location retrieval process.\nReinforcement learning allowed the system to continuously learn from guest interactions by surfacing new areas for a given destination and adjusting the retrieval map area based on guest booking behavior. This approach, known as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem, involved balancing exploration (surfacing new locations) with exploitation (surfacing previous successful locations). The system could actively experiment with different retrieval map areas learning from guest bookings to refine its predictions.\nApplying a contextual multi-armed bandit traditionally requires defining an active contextual estimator, a method for uncertainty estimation, and an exploration strategy. We took the following approach given product constraints, system constraints, and the nature of our model formulation. The architecture is depicted in the figure below.\n\nActive contextual estimation: We employed our existing machine learning model for location retrieval retrained on a daily basis to regularly learn from any new bookings data that we collect while surfacing previously unshown locations.\nUncertainty estimation: We modified our model architecture with a random dropout layer to generate 32 unique predictions for a given search (Monte Carlo Dropout). This allows us to measure the mean and standard deviation of our prediction while minimizing negative impact to system performance and changes to our existing model formulation.\nExploration Strategy: We compute an upper confidence bound using the mean and standard deviation of our prediction in order to construct larger retrieval map areas based on the model’s confidence in its prediction for the search.\n\nThis system successfully explored more for less-traveled locations where it was less confident and explored less for locations that are often searched and booked. For example, pictured below are the mean (inner) and upper confidence bound (outer) estimates of retrieval map areas for San Francisco, CA (left) and Smith Mountain Lake, Virginia (right). San Francisco is searched almost 25x more than Smith Mountain Lake with proportionately more bookings as well. As a result, the model is more confident in its retrieval map area estimate for San Francisco vs Smith Mountain Lake resulting in 2–3x less exploration for San Francisco queries vs Smith Mountain Lake.\n\nThe reinforcement learning system was also tested against the outgoing machine learning model in online A/B experiments showing a cumulative 0.51% increase in uncanceled bookers and 0.71% increase in 5 star trip rate over two iterations that introduced reinforcement learning and optimized scoring of the more complex model.\nConclusion: A Transformative Journey\nAirbnb’s journey from simple heuristics to sophisticated machine learning and reinforcement learning models demonstrates the power of data-driven approaches in transforming complex systems. By continually iterating and improving its location retrieval process, Airbnb has not only enhanced the relevance of its search results but also helped guests experience more 5 star trips.\nThis transformation cumulatively results in a 2.66% increase in uncanceled bookers — a major achievement for a company operating at Airbnb’s scale.

While this approach was helpful, we have discovered that including more relevant context can greatly improve the quality of these suggestions.\nWith this latest update, GitHub Copilot now automatically considers semantically relevant files for additional context, even if these files are not open in your editor.

Today, we’re excited to share our latest innovation – a guided chat experience within GitHub Copilot that reshapes how developers interact with AI. This guided chat experience is available in Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 3 and above.\nThis guided way to chat was created with one clear goal in mind: to make interactions between developers and AI more natural, effective, and aligned with everyday workflows. It is our deep belief that conversational AI is the future of development, and we’re committed to leading that transformation.\nMaking Copilot Conversations Smarter and Simpler\nAs we’ve refined GitHub Copilot, one thing has become clear: while users appreciate the potential of AI-driven tools, there’s a learning curve. Developers have shared that crafting the right prompt can sometimes feel like a challenge—understanding how to phrase a question, knowing what context to include, and making the most of Copilot’s capabilities. In some cases, the experience left users feeling like they were getting too much or too little from their interactions.\nCustomer feedback highlights the challenge:\n“The chat experience is helpful, but I wish it felt more like an assistant—something that could help guide me and give me only what I need without extra noise.”\n“I love how Copilot just starts generating, but it sometimes feels like I have to sift through a lot to get to what I actually wanted.”\nThese insights inspired us to rethink how AI should work for developers. Rather than relying only on intent-based commands or predefined prompts, this chat allows for a more fluid, conversational experience—one that adapts to the user’s context and needs.\nHow does this work? \nOur guided chat experience takes Copilot beyond simple input-output exchanges, turning it into a collaborative assistant. When the context is clear, Copilot provides direct and relevant answers. When it isn’t, Copilot guides you by asking follow-up questions to ensure clarity and precision.\n\nThe implications are significant:\nMore Engagement: Developers spend less time figuring out how to phrase their prompts and more time focused on the task at hand.\nLess Complexity: Copilot’s ability to guide and clarify reduces the need for developers to navigate complex intent systems.\nIncreased Productivity: With less back-and-forth and more focused responses, developers can move faster through their workflows.\nIn our early trials, we’ve seen encouraging signs that Guided Chat makes a real difference. So we are excited for you all to try it out.\nAs we continue refining this guided way to chat, user feedback and engagement will be at the center of our improvements, ensuring that it delivers the intelligent and seamless experience developers need.\nThank you for your continuous feedback\nWe owe much of our progress to our users’ invaluable feedback. Your insights and suggestions have been instrumental in making Visual Studio better with each update. We appreciate your continuous support and look forward to bringing you more innovative features.\nThe post Introducing a new, more conversational way to chat with GitHub Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "지난해 8월에 한국에 들어와서 KAIST에서 근무한 지 1년이 지났다. 그동안 국내외에 계신 분들을 만날 때면, 한국에 들어가서 어떠냐, 좋으냐는 질문을 많이 들었고, 그때마다 “너무 좋아요, 행복해요”라는 말을 많이도 하고 다녔다.\n최근에 ‘나는 왜 한국 생활이 행복한가?’라는 질문에 대해 자세히 살펴볼 기회가 있었다. 내가 한국 생활에서 만족스러운 점들, 어떤 순간들에 재미를 느꼈는지는 어렴풋하게는 파악하고 있었지만, ‘왜?’라는 질문에 답하려고 시도한 것은 처음이다.\n \n\nKAIST 부임 벌써 1년. 바쁜지, 행복한지 묻는 중요한 질문 앞에서, 오늘 저녁 메뉴를 생각하며 고뇌에 빠진 모습이다.\n\n \n \n우선 정말 단순하게도 내가 태어나고 자란 나라, 한국이기 때문이다. 한국을 떠난 지 20년이나 됐기 때문에 나도 한국도 여러 가지 의미로 달라진 것은 사실이지만, 여전히 내가 태어난 나라이고, 언어적·문화적 뿌리를 공유하는 사람들이 많이 모여 사는 나라다. 이런 환경이 주는 알 수 없는 심리적 안정감이 있다.\nKAIST이기 때문이다. 이것은 몇 가지 의미를 갖고 있다. 첫째로는 내 모교라는 점이다. 내 추억이 있는 곳에서 일하는 것이 단순한 직장 이상의 의미를 준다. 둘째로는 한국 사회에서 KAIST가 가지는 지위 때문에 내게 주어지는 많은 기회들이 있다. 좋은 학생들을 만나기에도, 좋은 연구 프로젝트를 만나기에도 유리한 환경이다. 셋째로는 사회에 기여하기를 바라는 KAIST의 미션 때문이다. 한국 사회에 기여할 기회가 KAIST 교수에게만 주어지는 것은 아닐 테지만, 내가 개인적으로 갖고 있는 미션과 내가 속한 기관의 미션이 일치하는 점이 있다는 것에 대한 만족감이 있다.\n자극이 되는 동료 교수님들 때문이다. 내가 속한 학과 안팎에 지적으로 자극을 주시는 여러 동료 교수님들이 계시고, 그런 분들과 편안하게 어울리기도 하고 함께 일하기도 한다. 그분들의 프로페셔널한 모습도 자극이 많이 되지만, 그분들과 사적이며 내밀한 이야기를 나누기도 하며, 서로의 개인사를 공유하기도 한다. 그 과정에서 서로의 가치관에 대해 이야기도 해보는데, 그 과정이 많은 자극이 된다. 당연히, 미국이라고 그런 분들이 없었던 건 아니지만, 한국에는, KAIST에는 바로 옆 방에 계시기도 하고, 같은 건물, 같은 캠퍼스에 계신다. 그러다 보니 아무래도 그런 자극의 빈도가 높다.\n오믈렛 때문이다. 한국에 들어오면서 같은 학과 교수님과 창업을 하게 되었고, 아직까지는 순항 중이다. 창업하고, 동료를 모으고, 투자받고, 회사의 모양을 가꾸어 가면서 여러 가지 어려움이 있지만, 학교에서는 볼 수 없었던 새로운 도전을 맞이하고 있다. 그 도전들을 극복해나가는 과정에서 ‘내가 왜 그랬을까’라는 생각이 들 때도 있었지만, 내가 하고 있는 연구를 기반으로 한 회사를 만들고 있다는 것이 즐겁다. 훌륭한 동료들을 맞이했다는 것도 자랑스럽고, 그 사이에서 내가 할 수 있는 역할이 있다는 점도 흥미롭다. 나는 CTO 역할을 맡고 있지만, 인사, 법무, 계약, 재무, 세무 등 관련 일들도 많이 하면서 새로운 도전을 즐기고 있다. 교원의 기술 기반 회사 창업이라는 점이 KAIST의 미션과 부합한다는 것도 동기부여에 도움이 된다.\n그리고, 가장 중요하게, 내 학생들 때문이다.\n나는 한국에 와서 지금 만난 학생들을 지도하는 것이 매우 즐거운데, 그 이유에 대해 조금 더 곰곰이 생각해봤다. 이 말 하고 싶어서 이 글을 쓴다.\n내가 만난 KAIST 학생들은 그 누구보다 재능 넘치고 성실한 학생들이다. Work ethic이 매우 훌륭하고, 노력을 많이 기울이는 것에 대한 인내심이 높은 편이다. 이런 학생들을 마다할 교수가 어디 있겠나? 나는 이것만으로도 복받았다. 독립적인 사고, 자신의 의견에 대한 고집, 비정형 문제 해결 능력 등은 아직 부족한 편으로 보일 때도 있는데, 아직 학부 졸업한 지 1년밖에 안 된 학생들이니 당연할 것이라 생각된다. 부족한 점은 지도교수인 내가 잘 가이드해주고 조언해주면 될 일이다.\n언어와 문화를 공유하는 학생들이라는 점이 주는 이점이 꽤 있다. 학생들과 공부만 하고 연구만 하면 될 일이겠지만, 나는 그 과정에서 섬세한 피드백을 주는 것을 즐기는 사람이라는 것을 알게 되었다. 학생과 대화할 때 모국어가 아닌 영어로만 대화할 때와 비교해서는 커뮤니케이션의 해상도가 매우 높아진다. “잘 이해되었나요? 네, 이해했습니다.”와 같은 단순한 대화에서도 내가 그 학생에 대해 파악할 수 있는 것들이 많다. 그 학생의 표정과 몸짓, 말하는 억양 같은 것에서 읽을 수 있는 것들이 많고, 그에 맞게 내 다음 행동을 이어나갈 수 있다. 모든 사람들이 이런 해상도 높은 커뮤니케이션을 즐기는 것은 아니겠지만, 나는 그런 걸 즐기는 사람이었다. 미국에서는 경험하기 어려운 것들이었다. 물론, 이런 방식의 커뮤니케이션을 학생들도 즐기고 있는지, 학생들의 성장에 정말 도움이 될 것인지에 대해서는 아직 의문이 있으나, 다만 이런 방식이 내가 선호하고 즐기는 방식이라는 거다.\n한국 학교에서 한국 학생들을 가르치고 지도하여 성장에 도움을 주고 있다는 사실 그 자체가 주는 충족감이 있다. 한국으로 돌아오면서 남긴 글에서 미국에서 지낼 때는 내가 속한 커뮤니티를 명확히 구분하기가 쉽지 않아서 혼란스러웠다고 말한 바 있는데, 한국에 돌아와서야 아무래도 그 점들이 좀 더 명확해졌다. 한국 학생들을 성실히 지도한다는 것 자체가 내가 속한 커뮤니티에 기여할 수 있는 점이라고 생각되며, 그 점에서 학생 지도에 대한 동기부여가 잘 되고 있다.\n그런데, 아무리 이렇다고 한들, 학생들을 지도하는 점이 나를 그렇게까지 행복하게 만들 일인가?\n대체 왜?\n둘째 아이 키우는 것 같다. 이게 내 결론이다.\n흔히 첫째 아이는 부부가 직업적으로 경제적으로 가장 도전적인 상황에서 맞게 되는 경우가 많고, 부모로서의 경험 미숙 등으로 좀 더 엄격하게 대하게 되는 경향이 있다. 사랑스러운 아이지만, 필요 이상의 텐션을 유지하며 키우게 되어 부모와 아이 양쪽의 스트레스가 높아지기도 한다. 반면에 둘째 아이는 대체로 부부가 조금 더 안정되었을 때, 그리고 아이 양육 경험도 충분히 쌓였을 때 맞이하게 되며, 그래서 좀 더 여유가 있다. 흔히 ‘숨만 쉬어도 예쁘다’라는 표현으로 둘째 아이의 사랑스러움에 대해 이야기한다. 적어도 내 개인적인 경험과는 일치한다. 내 첫째 아이는 박사과정 막학기에 태어났고 엄마, 아빠가 모두 테뉴어 트랙 조교수일 때 자랐다. 둘째 아이는 엄마, 아빠가 모두 테뉴어를 받을 때쯤 나고 자랐다. 여전히 바쁘고 힘들었지만, 둘째 양육은 첫째 때와는 양상이 좀 다를 수밖에 없었다. 이런저런 이유로 첫째 아이는 좀 더 차분하고, 둘째 아이는 좀 더 애교 넘친다.\n한국에서 바로 테뉴어트랙을 시작한 교수님들도 첫 지도 학생 그룹이 기억에 많이 남으실 거다. 서로 혼란스러운 시기를 같이 공부하고 같이 연구하며 헤쳐 나가면서 교수와 학생 모두 성공적으로 커리어에 안착하고 독립적인 학자가 되어 졸업하는 시기를 보내면 서로 미운 정 고운 정 다 들 것이다. 하지만 그 과정에서 겪는 테뉴어 트랙 조교수의 스트레스가 무시무시할 수 있다. 미래에 대한 불확실성, 연구비 확보의 어려움, 연구 성과가 잘 나오지 않을 때 겪는 초조함 등으로 교수는 스트레스를 받고, 어쩌면 학생들에게 불필요하게 모질게 대하는 경우도 있을 테다. 학생들도 그 과정에서 힘들고 스트레스를 많이 받을 테고, 졸업할 때쯤이면 지도교수가 미워질지도 모른다. 첫째 아이를 양육하는 것과 비슷한 일이 생긴다.\n나는 미국에서 15년간 15명의 박사과정 학생을 지도하면서 이 과정을 모두 다 겪고 한국에 왔다. 다양한 유형의 학생을 이미 지도 해 본 적 있으며, 연구 역량도 쌓았고, 인적 네트워크도 갖추었으며, 테뉴어도 받아서 마음 조급할 일들은 많이 줄어들었다. 그래서 여유롭다. 위에서 말한 KAIST의 여러 이점들 때문에, 또 여러 멋진 동료 교수님들의 도움으로 첫해부터 매우 운이 좋게도 연구비에 대한 걱정도 많이 없는 상황이다. 내가 학생들에게 해주고 싶은 걸 충분히 해줄 수 있는 상황인 것 같다.\n이런 심적으로 물적으로 여유 있는 상황에서 학생 지도를 하니, 성실하고 재능 있는 내 학생들이 안 예뻐 보일 리 없다. 학생들을 지도하기 위해 만나는 주간 미팅이 즐겁지 않을 리 없다. 학생들이 조금씩 성장해 나가고 성취를 이뤄 나가는 걸 지켜보는 것이 조마조마하면서도 매우 즐겁다. 학생들에게 아쉬운 소리를 하는 경우가 없는 것은 아니지만, 학생들에게 좀 더 관대한 마음으로 조언을 해 줄 수 있다. 운 좋게 여유로운 상황에서 내 마음에 드는 훌륭한 학생들을 만나게 되었고, 그 과정이 매우 즐겁다. 학생들은 훌륭하고, 나만 잘하면 된다.\n‘숨만 쉬어도 예쁜’ 내 학생들은, 다만 숨을 좀 열심히 쉬어야 하기는 한다. 아직 대학원 1~2년 차들이라 수업 들으면서 숙제도 많은데, 내가 진행하고 있는 연구 프로젝트들도 좀 있고, 개인 연구도 진행해야 한다. 그걸 모두 다 해내야 하는데, 또 내가 신나서 벌리는 일들이 좀 있다. 그런 것들 서포트하느라 힘들어하기도 하지만, 아직까지는 모든 학생들이 다 잘 해나가고 있는 것 같다. 한계점에 가까워질 뻔한 일들도 몇 차례 있었던 것 같은데, 해상도 높은 커뮤니케이션의 도움으로 일단은 잘 지나간 것으로 믿고 있다. (이건 학생들 말도 들어봐야…)\n즐거운 마음으로 학생들을 지도하고 있고, 앞으로 좋은 연구자가 될 수 있도록 성실히 잘 지도해야겠다고 다짐한다. 내가 즐기는 만큼, 내 학생들도 나와 함께 공부하고 연구하는 것을 즐길 수 있으면 좋겠다. 학위 과정 중 언젠가 밑바닥으로 내려가는 학생들도 있을 텐데, 그때도 내가 도움이 될 수 있으면 좋겠다. 5년 뒤에도, 10년 뒤에도 계속 학생 지도하는 것이 이렇게 즐거웠으면 좋겠다는 생각을 많이 하고, 그러기 위해 지금부터 내가 해야 할 일이 무엇인지 고민이 많다.\n…\n셋째가 그렇게 예쁘다던데…",

수 있는 관련 글 2개를 링크로 추가한다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://haeti.palms.blog/effective-kotlin\">Item 1. 가변성을 제한하라 - 안정성 - link</a></li>\n  <li><a

/></p>\n\n<h2>UDF(unidirectional data flow)</h2>\n\n<p>아키텍처를 적극 사용하는 현재는 데이터 흐름이 복잡할 수밖에 없다. 이를 가장 쉽게 설명할 수 있는 부분이 바로 UDF이다.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture\">Architecting your Compose UI - UDF 부분 참고 - link</a></p>\n\n<p>UDF는 단방향 데이터 플로우인데, 위에서 설명한 blocking, nonblocking 역시 단방향 플로우를 가진다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A 함수를 실행</li>\n  <li>B 함수의 처리</li>\n  <li>다시 A 함수로 돌아와 이어가기</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>데이터 흐름상 단방향이다.</p>\n\n<p>Observer pattern + stream에서는?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A 함수를 실행</li>\n  <li>B 함수에 구독을 요청하고, stream으로 데이터 흐름을 전달 받는 대기</li>\n  <li>A 함수로 돌아와 A 함수는 끝나고, Stream의 데이터 흐름을 대기</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>동기와 비동기가 적절하게 포함되어 있는 형태이다.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h3>아키텍처에서의 UDF</h3>\n\n<p>UDF는 데이터 흐름을 쉽게 이해하는 데 이를 아주 쉽게 설명한 설명이다.</p>\n\n<p>모든 흐름은 함수의 호출과 그 함수 안에서 새로운 함수의 호출 또는 구독으로 이루어진다. 이를 설명하는 가장 쉬운 방법이 UDF 인 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 아래의 코드에 대해서 UDF로 설명해 보자.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin

        "contentSnippet": "제미나이에게 개발에서 데이터 흐름이란?를 알려달라고 했다.\n개발에서 데이터 흐름은 어떤 시스템이나 소프트웨어에서 데이터가 생성되고, 변환되며, 저장되고, 전송되는 과정을 의미합니다. 마치 물이 강을 따라 흐르듯이, 데이터는 시스템 내에서 특정한 경로를 따라 이동하며 가치를 창출합니다.\n위키백과도 한번 확인해 보았다.\n위키 백과 데이터 흐름 - 링크\n데이터 흐름(Data flow, 데이터 플로)란 하나의 작업을 수행하기 위하여 실행되는 각각의 세부 작업들 사이에서 자료가 입력되고 출력되는 모습을 의미한다.\n결국 같은 말이다.\n우리가 매우 흔하게 사용하는 데이터 흐름을 가볍게 이해하는 표현으로 서문을 작성해 보았다.\n이 글에서 데이터 다양한 데이터 흐름을 이해하는 데 도움이 될만한 내용을 정리해 본 글인데, 실제 함수 위주이니 참고만 한다고 생각하길\n이 글에서는\n함수의 blocking vs nonblocking\nObserver pattern + stream\nUDF(unidirectional data flow)\n매우 주관적으로 작성한 글이다.\n데이터 흐름(Data flow)에 대한 새로운 형태를 만드는 짝퉁 설명이니 재미로 읽기를\n함수의 blocking vs nonblocking\n함수에는 blocking과 nonblocking으로 구분된다.\n\nfun main() {\n    println(\"main\")\n    someA()\n    println(\"end)\n}\n\nfun someA() {\n    println(\"run some a\")\n}\n\n\n이 함수의 결과는 다음과 같다.\n\nmain\nrun some a\nend\n\n\n이유는 간단하다. blocking이기 때문이다.\n그럼 아래의 코드는?\n\nfun main() {\n    println(\"main\")\n    someA()\n    println(\"end\")\n}\n\nfun someA() = CoroutinesScope().launch {\n    println(\"run coroutines)\n}\n\n\n이 함수의 결과는 다음과 같을 수 있다.\n\nmain\nend\nrun coroutines\n\n\n이는 nonblocking이니 가능한 결과이지만 end 전에 coroutines이 실행되어 순서대로 나올 순 있다.\n여기서의 흐름은 처음 예제는 명확히 순서를 보장한다는 점이고, 후자는 비동기가 필요하기에 순서의 보장이 필요 없는 경우를 말한다.\n데이터 흐름에서 가장 중요한 부분은 비동기라고 할 수 있다.\n\n그럼 아래의 코드는 blocking, nonblocking 중 어느 것일까?\n아래 링크에 포함되어 있는 코드를 그대로 가져왔다.\ncoroutineScope - link\n\nfun main() {\n    CoroutinesScope().launch {\n        println(\"main\")\n        showSomeData()\n        println(\"end\")\n    }\n}\n\nsuspend fun showSomeData() = coroutineScope {\n    val data = async(Dispatchers.IO) { // <- extension on current scope\n     ... load some UI data for the Main thread ...\n    }\n\n    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {\n        doSomeWork()\n        val result = data.await()\n        display(result)\n    }\n}\n\n\nmain 함수는 blocking\nmain 함수의 CoroutinesScope().launch의 시작점은 nonblocking\nlaunch { } 안의 내용은 blocking\nshowSomeData()의 async 시작 부분은 nonblocking\nshowSomeData()의 async 내부는 blocking\nshowSomeData()의 withContext 부분은 blocking\n이 코드는 blocking과 nonblocking이 매우 많이 뒤섞여있다.\n이런 코드가 아주 흔한 일이다. 여기서 동기와 비동기 부분을 명확히 이해해야 데이터 흐름을 빠르게 파악할 수 있다.\n이 코드는 이 글의 핵심은 아니지만 동기와 비동기를 이해하는 데 있어 중요한 코드이며, coroutines은 일반적인 함수의 사용만큼이나 쉽다는 점이다.\n\nObserver pattern + stream\n다음 문장은 어떤 부분을 설명하는 걸까?\n\n물이 흐르고 있다. 이 흐르는 물에 새로운 물줄기를 추가했다.\n\n\n이 설명은 개발에서 HotFlow/HotObserve에 대한 설명일 수 있지만 내가 적었으니 맞다.\n여기서 중요한 부분은 무엇일까?\n바로 흐름(flow)이다. Observer pattern에서 데이터 흐름을 설명하는 쉬운 방법 중 하나이다.\n물이 흐른다는 표현을 적었으니 흐르는구나를 알 수 있고, 지속적인 흐름을 의미할 수 있다.\n반대로 흐르지 않는 경우도 있는데 어떻게 설명해 볼 수 있을까?\n\n나는 얼음이다. 땡 해주기 전에는 움직일 수 없다.\n\n\n\nCoroutines flow는?\nAsynchronous Flow - link\nA suspending function asynchronously returns a single value, but how can we return multiple asynchronously computed values? This is where Kotlin Flows come in.\n코루틴 flow는 단일 값을 한 번씩 호출하여 사용할 수 있는 suspend 대신 지속적인 흐름을 가지기 위한 개념을 포함한다. 바로 Observer + stream을 포함한다.\n\nHotFlow/ColdFlow?\n서문에 적은 설명은 오류를 가질 수 있지만 HotFlow/ColdFlow를 각각 설명하기 쉬운 주제라고 생각하여 필자가 주로 설명하는 방식이다.\nHotFlow는 두 가지가 존재하는데\nStateFlow\nSharedFlow\n사용법이 다를 뿐 둘 다 HotFlow이다.\nColdFlow는\nflow {}\nflowOf()\nflow의 시작점이다.\n\n추가로 - O 어떤 걸로 구성되어 있을까?\n이 글에서는 상세한 내용을 알아보기 위해서 적는 글은 아니니 가볍게 가볍게 어떤 구성으로 이루어져 있을까만 적어본다.\n얼음이거나 물이 흐르거나로 표현할 수 있었던 이유는 흐르는 물 사이에 새로운 물줄기를 만들거나 얼음을 깨어 새로운 데이터 흐름을 추가할 수 있다는 소리인데\n요즘 안드로이드에서는 잘 사용하지 않는 ReactiveX 문서에는 여전히\n\nReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from\nthe Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming\n\n\n이라고 표현하고 있다.\n이 데이터 흐름을 이해하기 위해서는 결국 Observer pattern과 Iterator pattern 만 알아도 충분히 이해할 수 있다는 이야기다.\n그럼 안드로이드 개발에서 상태의 기억을 가지는 3가지 나열해 보면 아래와 같다.\nRxJava - Subject 패턴들 4가지가 있으나 상황에 따라 다른 사용을 가짐\nStateFlow\nLiveData\n이들은 모두 데이터의 제공과 이를 소비하는 패턴으로 만들어져있다.\n이때 중요한 부분은 불변으로 데이터를 소비할 수 있도록 만들어주는 데 있다. 불변과 equals/hashCode의 중요성을 각각 확인할 수 있는 관련 글 2개를 링크로 추가한다.\nItem 1. 가변성을 제한하라 - 안정성 - link\n[Kotlin/Java] HashSet, HashMap 내부 구현 살펴보기 - link\n추가로 RxJava를 제외한 Flow와 LiveData는 Android에서 라이프 사이클에 따른 처리가 잘 되어있는 반면 RxJava는 직접 처리해야 할 부분이 많고 현재는 레거시로 취급되니 궁금하신 분은 RxJava 관련 문서를 참고하시길\n\nUDF(unidirectional data flow)\n아키텍처를 적극 사용하는 현재는 데이터 흐름이 복잡할 수밖에 없다. 이를 가장 쉽게 설명할 수 있는 부분이 바로 UDF이다.\nArchitecting your Compose UI - UDF 부분 참고 - link\nUDF는 단방향 데이터 플로우인데, 위에서 설명한 blocking, nonblocking 역시 단방향 플로우를 가진다.\nA 함수를 실행\nB 함수의 처리\n다시 A 함수로 돌아와 이어가기\n데이터 흐름상 단방향이다.\nObserver pattern + stream에서는?\nA 함수를 실행\nB 함수에 구독을 요청하고, stream으로 데이터 흐름을 전달 받는 대기\nA 함수로 돌아와 A 함수는 끝나고, Stream의 데이터 흐름을 대기\n동기와 비동기가 적절하게 포함되어 있는 형태이다.\n\n아키텍처에서의 UDF\nUDF는 데이터 흐름을 쉽게 이해하는 데 이를 아주 쉽게 설명한 설명이다.\n모든 흐름은 함수의 호출과 그 함수 안에서 새로운 함수의 호출 또는 구독으로 이루어진다. 이를 설명하는 가장 쉬운 방법이 UDF 인 것이다.\n그럼 아래의 코드에 대해서 UDF로 설명해 보자.\n\n@Composable\nfun Screen(viewModel: SomeViewModel) {\n    val someUiState by viewModel.someUiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()\n    \n    Screen(\n        someUiState = someUiState,\n        onClick = { viewModel.fatchSome() },\n    )\n}\n\n@Composable\nfun Screen(\n    someUiState: SomeUiState,\n    onClick: () -> Unit,\n) {\n    Button(\n        onClick = onClick,\n    )\n}\n\nclass SomeViewModel(\n    private val someRepository: SomeRepository,\n) {\n    private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(SomeUiState.Default)\n    val uiState = _uiState.asStateFlow()\n\n    init {\n        someRepository.flowSome()\n            .map { it.toState() }\n            .onEach { _uiState.value = it }\n            .launchIn(viewModelScope)\n    }\n\n    fun fatchSome() = viewModelScope.launch {\n        someRepository.fatchSome()\n    }\n}\n\ninterface SomeRepository {\n\n    fun flowSome(): Flow<SomeEntity>\n\n    suspend fun fatchSome()\n}\n\ncalss SomeRepsotiryImpl(\n    private val api: SomeApi,\n) : SomeRepository {\n\n    private val flowSome = MutableStateFlow<SomeEntity?>(null)\n\n    override fun flowSome(): Flow<SomeEntity> =\n        flowSome.filterNotNull()\n\n    override suspend fun fatchSome() {\n        val resutl = api.fatchSome()\n        flowSome.value = result.toEntity()\n    }\n}\n\n\n코드에 대한 설명은 제외하고 데이터 흐름만을 알아보자.\n사용자의 onClick Event를 Composable 함수 Screen에서 발생\nViewModel fatchSome() 함수가 호출\nViewModel에서는 fatchSome() 함수에서 repository의 fatchSome() 함수를 호출\n    \nrepository에서는 fatchSome 함수의 응답을 지속적인 흐름을 가지기 위해 flow를 별도로 가진다\nrepository에서는 someApi를 통해 fatchSome()을 호출한다.\n응답받은 fatchSome()의 결과를 flowSome에 전달한다.\nViewModel에서는 구독 중인 flowSome으로부터 응답을 받고, 상태를 변환하여 UI에 통지하여 UI를 갱신한다.\n이 코드는 아주 일반적인 UiState를 서버와의 통신을 통해 갱신하기 위한 부분이다. 여기서 조금 더 나아가면 리엑트의 이펙트까지 포함할 수 있다.\n말은 길지만 이 방식은 UDF로 설명하지 않았을 뿐 오래전부터 써오던 방식이다.\n그리고 다른 사람들에게 설명하는 가장 간단한 프로세스인데, 필자의 블로그에서도 다양하게 확인할 수 있는 과거의 글들이 많이 있다.\nUDF. 단방향을 통해 데이터 흐름을 설명할 수 있다는 부분이 중요한 포인트이다.\n이 시점에서 추가로 알아두면 좋은 글들을 나열한다.\nJetpack Compose로 UI 조합(Composition)하기 심화 - link\nCompose 함수는 어떤 조건으로 나누는것이 좋을까?(Stateful, stateless) - link\nMVVM에서 MVI로 - link\n[Android / Compose] Circuit 찍먹 해보기 - link\nComposable 함수를 어떻게 분리하는 것이 좋을지에 대한 글과 MVI에 대한 설명의 글이다.\n그리고 직전에 작성했던 Theme를 다루는 내용도 있으니 함께 보아도 좋을 듯하다.\n안드로이드 Theme와 GetStream Theme를 알아보고 CompositionLocalProvider의 역할을 알아본다. - link\n\n서버와의 데이터 흐름\n데이터 흐름의 마지막을 서버와 데이터 흐름을 이야기해 볼 수 있지만 자세한 내용은 없이 어떤 도구를 활용하는지 정도만 이야기해 보려 한다.\n클라 입장에서는 서버와의 데이터 통신할 때는 json을 주로 활용한다. 최근에는 protobuf를 활용하는 곳도 많은데 장/단점이 있으니 각각 기술은 서버 개발자와 논의하면 좋다.\njson : JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) - link\nxml : Extensible Markup Language (XML) - link\nprotobuf : Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) - link\n데이터 흐름을 얼마나 더 넓게 보는지에 따라 서버에서 제공하는 직전까지의 데이터 흐름으로 설명할 것인지, 이를 넘어가서 설명할 것인지도 정의할 수 있을 것 같다.\n우리는 string 형태의 데이터를 주고받는 것이 일반적이지만 결국 이런 데이터는 0/1의 데이터로 변환된다.\n\n서버까지 포함하여 데이터의 개념은?\n필자는 클라 개발자라 서버에 대해 자세한 이해는 없으니 가볍게 설명해 보겠다.\n클라에서의 데이터 응답을 http 통신을 통해 요청하게 된다.\n    \n이때 http는 블로킹 상태로 클라에서는 서버가 응답을 주기 전까지 대기하는데, 이때 클라에서는 UI 상 사용자에게 처리 중임을 알려준다.\n서버는 캐싱 상태를 체크하고, DB 서버에 응답을 요청한다.\nDB 서버는 동기/비동기 상태로 entity를 전달해 주고, 이를 기반으로 클라와 약속한 json 데이터로 변환 후 bloking 상태의 http에 응답해 준다.\n클라 입장에서는 nonblocking이겠지만 nonblocking 이후에는 모두 blocking 상태로 서버도 동작한다는 점이다.\n서버는 사실상 blocking 작업 상태처럼 보이지만 nonblocking으로 보일 수 있다. 그 안에서 또 nonblocking 작업들이 일어나는 것이다.\n모든 처리가 완료되면 클라이언트는 이를 바탕으로 UI에 표현하는 작업을 할 수 있다.\n여기서는 아키텍처 개념이 포함될 수 있지만 이 글에서는 다루지 않고, 좀 더 넓은 개념의 아키텍처에 대한 이야기를 준비 중이다.\n\n데이터 흐름으로 리액트를 이해할 수 있을까?\n리덕스에 대해 제미나이의 응답은 아래와 같다.\n\n리덕스(Redux)는 자바스크립트 애플리케이션의 상태 관리를 위한 예측 가능한 상태 컨테이너이다.\n쉽게 말해, 애플리케이션의 데이터를 효율적으로 관리하고 예측 가능하게 만들어주는 도구라고 할 수 있다.\n\n\n이미 많은 안드로이드 개념에서 리덕스 개념이 포함되어 있는데, UiState와 UDF? 부분일 것 같다.\n필자가 직접 iOS TCA를 접하고 있는데, 직접 써보고, 설명을 통해 파악한 리덕스 개념은 아래와 같다.\nThe Composable Architecture - link\n이벤트의 흐름 : 이벤트의 흐름은 최종 사용자가 가장 아래에 있으니 이를 거슬러 올라가듯 설명한다.\n  현재 나의 이벤트가 보이는 화면상이라면 이를 이전 화면에 전달한다. 이런 흐름의 설명이 업스트림으로 설명할 수 있다.\n데이터 흐름 : 데이터는 위에서 아래로 흘러간다.\n  데이터 최신화 시 아래로 아래로 흘러간다. 이런 데이터 흐름을 통해 내가 필요한 부분을 캐치하고 화면을 갱신할 수 있다.\n검색과 짧은 지식으로 정리할 수 있는 개념은 딱 요 정도일 것 같다.

앞으로 어떻게 발전해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n대략 2-3년 차에 많이 생각하는 주제(그러나 그 이후에도 이 고민은 계속된다. 답은 없고, 환경이 변하기 때문. 연차가 쌓이면 새로운 환경에 가고 새로운 의사 결정을 하게 될 수 있음)\n입사하고 초반엔 새로운 일들이 많아서 해당 내용들을 습득하고, 주어진 일을 하나씩 하면서 정신없이 보냄\n        \n그러다가 1, 2년이 지나고 일이 익숙해질 때쯤 커리어에 대해 고민함\n이런 고민을 하게 된 배경은 다양하게 존재할 수 있는데, 업무가 지루하다고 생각하거나, 스스로가 생각하는 이 직무가 해야 하는 일이 정의되어 있지만 그걸 안하 고 있어서 고민하는 경우도 있음\n아마 일이 즐겁고, 보람차고 프로젝트를 잘 진행하고 있다면 이런 고민은 하지 않을 가능성이 존재\n컨퍼런스에서 발표를 보거나, 외부 요소(취업 시장이 어렵다는 이야기), 친구들과의 비교 등을 통해 이런 고민을 하게 될 수도 있음\n제 생각\n    \n이 직무를 왜 시작하게 되었는지가 중요하고, 나에 대한 인지(메타인지)가 있으면 더 깊은 고민을 할 수 있음\n        \n내가 이 직무를 왜 하고 싶었는지, 초심은 무엇이었는지 등\n내가 처음 원했던 방향을 계속 고수해야 한다는 생각은 아니고, 내가 최초의 방향을 잘 생각하고 있는지 고민하며, 그 이후 자신의 경험을 얹어서 새로운 길로 가야 할지 정리하는 것도 괜찮음\n살다 보면 초심을 잊고 살아가는 경우가 많고, 초심에 대한 내용을 블로그 등에 작성하고 지속적으로 보는 것도 좋다고 생각함\n좋은 커리어의 기준은 누가 정해주는 것이 아니라 스스로가 정의해야 함\n        \n다른 사람이 좋다는 A라는 기준이 나중에 시간이 흐르면 다르게 될 수도 있음. 과거의 시기와 요즘은 또 다르게 생각할 수도 있음\n학생이나 신입은 경험이 없어서 기준이 적을 수 있고, 이럴 땐 다른 사람의 의견을 들어보기도 하는 것도 다 한 번쯤 경험함\n            \n그러나 나의 경험을 늘리면서 나만의 생각, 기준을 만들게 됨\n일반적으로 많이 나오는 연봉, 워라밸, 동료 등도 중요할 수 있지만 나의 근본적인 욕구나 이 직무를 선택한 이유에 따라 다를 수 있음\n            \n인정 욕구가 큰 사람에겐 워라밸보단 내 인정이 더 중요할 수 있음. 인정받기 위해 회사에서 성과를 높이려고 하고, 열심히 일하는 것이 즐거울 수 있음\n제가 생각하는 좋은 커리어는 “직무 하나에 나를 한정하지 말고 여러 경험을 하는 것. 문제 해결에 집중하는 것. 꾸준하게 계속 무언가를 시도하는 것”\n        \n여러 경험을 하다 보면 하고 싶지 않은 일을 할 수도 있지만, 그런 일도 경험으로 생각하는 편\n다른 사람들이 하지 않았던 여러 경험들이 합쳐지면 나만의 고유한 영역이 될 수 있다. 제너럴한 영역을 여러 개가 있고, 각 영역을 아주 잘하면 그게 또 새로운 스페셜이 될 수 있다고 생각함\n직무 관점에서도 MLOps나 Analytics Engineer가 하나의 직무에서 시작된 것이 아닌 다른 직무에서 확장되면서 생기는 직무라고 볼 수 있는데, 이와 유사하다고 생각\n저도 고민했던 시기가 있었음. 레트리카에서 데이터 분석가, 데이터 엔지니어 일을 조금씩 했었고 쏘카에선 데이터 분석가, 데이터 과학자, 머신러닝 엔지니어, 데이터 엔지니어, Engineering Manager 등을 경험했는데 너무 여러 가지를 경험해서 고민되기도 했지만 회사에서 요구하는 나의 역할을 최대한 잘 수행해 보자고 생각함\n        \n여러 경험을 했기에 직무의 협업 구조를 알 수 있고, 어떻게 프로젝트를 시작해야 할지, 사업부에선 어떤 관점으로 생각하는지 등을 모두 이해하게 됨\n조직을 키우는 경험도 해보면서, 조직의 규모에 따라 어떤 방식으로 운영해야 할지에 대해 고민을 할 수 있게 되었음\n때론 지금 하는 행동들에 너무 의지를 부여하지 않아도 괜찮았음. 시간이 지나서 그 의미를 찾는 경우도 있었음\n        \n의미를 너무 찾다가 시간이 지나갈 수도 있다는 이야기. 과거에 했던 것을 생각해보니 의미를 찾은 경우도 있기에 너무 의미를 찾는데 오래 걸린다면 잠시 실행해보는 것도 좋은 방법이라 생각(의미와 실행의 적절한 밸런스가 중요하다고 생각)\n좋은 커리어의 기준은 시간의 흐름에 따라 다를 수 있다. 내가 어떤 결정을 할지 기준을 가지고 있는지가 더 중요할 수 있음\n저는 연차별로 성장의 정의가 다 달랐음. 1-2년 차의 성장은 나의 성장, 3-6년차의 성장은 팀과 조직의 성장, 그 이후의 성장은 잘 회복하며 지금 현상 유지하기가 성장이였음. 지금의 성장도 다른 방향으로 가는 중\n\n정리하면 좋은 커리어의 정의는 내가 하는 것이고, 타인이 정해주지 않음. 나에 대해 생각을 해보고 나의 기준을 만드는 것을 추천함. 또한 시간의 흐름에 따라 성장은 달라질 수 있고 과거의 경험들이 갑자기 깨달음을 주는 경우도 있으니 걱정하지 말고 지금 순간을 잘 지내는 것을 추천함\n\n\n2) 데이터 과학자, 데이터 분석가. 데이터 직무의 고민. 커리어를 어떻게 발전해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n데이터 과학자나 데이터 분석가는 직무의 구분이 명확하지 않아 많은 사람들이 혼란스러워함(저도 과거에 그랬고, 요즘 커리어를 준비하는 분들도 여전히 혼란스러워함)\n        \n다양한 데이터 분석 직군 글을 보면 직무의 이름으로 판단하지 말고 실제 하는 일을 기반으로 판단하라고 작성했음\n1번의 고민(좋은 커리어)와 연결되는 부분인데 데이터 직무는 데이터 분석가지만 하는 일이 회사마다 정말 다양함\n        \n어떤 회사에선 데이터 엔지니어링을 하면서 인프라도 구축해야 하고,\n어떤 회사에선 대시보드 제작 위주로 진행되고\n어떤 회사에선 데이터 추출 요청 위주의 업무가 진행되기도 함\n위 상황과 더불어 데이터 관련 컨퍼런스에서 보면 다른 사람들은 멋진 업무 위주로 하는 것 같아서 자신과 업무를 비교하게 되는 경우도 존재\n제 생각\n    \n이럴 때 현타가 오고 이직 준비를 할 수 있음\n그러나 저는 데이터 관련 어떤 업무를 하더라도, 회사에서 필요한 업무라고 생각함. 다만 회사의 조직 규모의 차이가 있거나 데이터 문화의 차이가 존재할 뿐. 그 시기에 내가 다니고 있을 뿐이라 생각함\n데이터 문화가 아직 잘 정착하지 못했다면 직접 데이터를 추출해서 제공해야 할 수 있고, 대시보드도 데이터 직무가 만들어야 할 수 있음\n        \n이런 상황은 왜 만들어지고, 개선하려면 어떻게 해야 할까?를 고민하는 것도 좋다고 생각\n그럼 조직의 규모가 점점 커지면서 그 안에서 필요한 역할들이 무엇인지 알 수 있게 됨\n이 부분은 국가의 발전, 역사 공부를 하면서 어떻게 해야 더 좋은 조직의 구조를 갖출 수 있을까를 생각했음\n이왕 업무를 진행할 때, 너무 부정적으로 생각하는 것보다 이 업무를 한국 또는 세상에서 제일 잘하려면 어떻게 해야 할지를 고민함\n        \n단순 데이터 추출도 정말 빠르게 잘하려면? => 데이터를 잘 정리해 두는 것도 필요하고, 마트를 만드는 것도 필요하고, 쿼리를 실수 없이 작성하는 것도 필요\n하나의 Task도 더 구체적으로 쪼개보면 필요한 역량이 여러 가지고, 그것을 더 잘하도록 시도할 수 있음\n게임에서 하기 싫은 노가다 퀘스트를 하는 느낌일 수 있지만, 이런 퀘스트가 있어야 다음 퀘스트를 수월하게 진행할 수 있다고 생각함\n다른 사람과 비교하는 순간 자존감이 떨어질 수 있음. 왜냐하면 비교 대상이 대부분 자신보다 더 좋은 상황인 사람과 비교하는 경우가 더 많기 때문\n        \n컨퍼런스에서 발표하는 내용은 부정적인 것보단 긍정적인 것, 인사이트가 있는 것을 주로 발표할 수 있음. 그리고 그 발표가 그 사람의 전부가 아니라 특정 단면을 공유한 것일 수 있음\n다른 사람의 길이 아닌, 그냥 나의 길을 가보자고 생각하는 것을 추천\n내 이야기를 영화로 치면 지금 기승전결에서 중간에 있다고 생각하고, 어려운 상황이 나오면 역시 영화에 위기 한번 와야지! 이런 생각을 하곤 함\nLLM이 발전하면서 1인 생산성이 늘어나고, 단순한 데이터 추출은 LLM으로 대체하려는 시도가 엄청 많이 존재함. 조만간 SQL 작성은 데이터 직무의 일이 아닐 수 있을 것 같음\n        \n대신 데이터 직무가 무엇을 해야 할까? 생각해 보면 사내의 컨설턴트 역할이 될 수도 있고, 데이터 문화를 만드는 역할, 의사 결정을 위주로 하는 역할 등 다양한 역할이 나올 수 있음\n그러나 미래에도 과거처럼 작은 규모에선 직접 쿼리를 작성하는 시기도 있을 수 있음. 그래서 너무 걱정하는 것보단, 지금 하는 일을 잘하게 되면 나중에 도움이 되지 않을까 싶음\n커리어는 점진적으로 발전할 수 있으므로, 너무 조급하게 생각하지 말고 지금 할 수 있는 일부터 점진적으로 하는 것을 추천\n저도 시간이 지나서 8년 차가 되었음. 그동안의 경험이 아직도 생생한데 시간이 참 빠름.\n        \n커리어 초반, 학생 시절엔 ‘내가 될까?’에 집중했고 가능성이 있는지에 대한 질문을 많이 했음\n그러다가 경력을 쌓으면서 ‘내가 뭐가 될까’에 집중했음. 뭐가에 집중하면서 어떻게 해야 할까를 고민했음\n그러다가 요즘은 ‘내가 뭐든 되네’라는 생각을 함. 시간이 지나면 무엇이든 된다. 특정 시기에 내가 노력하지 않아도 회사의 업무를 하면서 경험이 쌓이고 있음. 혹은 내 개인 삶의 경험을 풍성하게 만들 수도 있는 것\n            \n무엇이든 되니 너무 걱정하지 말고 지금 하고 싶은 것이 뭘까, 어떻게 시간을 보낼까를 고민하고 하나씩 해보는 것이 좋지 않을까 싶음\n저는 ‘커리어의 목표가 무엇인가요?’라는 질문을 받으면 딱히 없고 그냥 오늘같이 하루하루 잘 보내는 것이 목표라고 말함. 장기적인 비전은 있으면 좋지만, 너무 큰 목표같이 느껴질 수 있어서 현실적인 오늘을 잘 살려고 함\n직무 관점에서 너무 직무 하나에 매몰되지 말고, 내가 얼마나 회사에 기여할 수 있고 사람들에게 도움을 줄 수 있을지를 생각하며 이 기준이 확장될 수 있는 기준으로 일하고 있음\n정리하면 어떤 일을 하더라도 회사에서 제일 잘하고, 세계에서 제일 잘하려면 어떻게 해야할까를 생각하면서 나의 길을 가려고 함. 좋은 커리어의 정의는 내가 하는 것이므로 내가 어떻게 하고 싶은지에 기반해서 하나씩 실행함. 직무에 한정되는 사람이 되지 말고 직무를 넘어서는 사람이 되려고 함\n\n\n3) 좋은 선택, 의사 결정이란 무엇일까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n의사 결정이 중요하다는 것은 많이 듣는데 그걸 어떻게 잘하는가에 대해서는 배운 적이 적음. 그러다 보니 How를 고민하게 됨\n멘토링 때도 종종 받는 질문으로 가장 중요한 순간의 선택, 후회하는 선택 등의 질문을 받음\n        \n아마 좋은 의사 결정, 좋은 선택하는 방법을 물어보는 질문이었던 것 같음\n의사 결정이 뭔가 한 번에 잘 돼야 할 것 같고, 틀리면 안 될 것 같은 고정 관념이 있었음\n제 생각\n    \n일단 저는 과거의 선택에 크게 연연하지 않는 성격. 과거 성격을 만약 돌릴 수 있다면 생각을 계속할 것 같은데, 그게 아니니까 현실을 직시한다. 그래서 과거 이야기를 물어봐도 잘 떠오르진 않음\n이렇게 된 계기를 생각해 보면 20대 중반부터 뭘 해도 잘 되는 경험이 없었음. 실패, 불합격 등이 많았는데 그게 너무 많아지니까 오히려 현실을 너무 낙관하지 않고 적절한 상태로 바라보곤 했다. 그러다가 니체 책을 보고 니체의 사상에 영감을 받음\n우선 “좋은” 이란 부분에 대한 정의가 필요함. 좋다라는 것은 상황에 따라 다를 수 있고, 구체적으로 정의가 된다면 지표로 나올 수 있음. 다만 지표로 나오지 않는다고 하면 너무 “좋은”에 집중하지 않으려고 함\n어떤 결정을 할 때, 들뜨지 않고 객관적으로 생각함\n        \n만약 지표로 표시할 수 있다면 지표를 정의한다. 숫자로 특정 상황을 표시하고, 이게 더 좋아지면 간다 등\n이 숫자가 높아질 때, 낮아질 때 어떤 Action을 할지 생각한다. 이런 과정을 Mental Simulation이라 부름\n            \n멘탈 시뮬레이션은 특정 행동을 하는 것을 상상하고, 행동하기 전에 예상되는 결과를 시뮬레이션하는 능력\n멘탈 시뮬레이션을 한다면 특정 순간의 지표가 좋지 않아도, 오르기 위해 어떤 것을 해야 할지 생각했으므로 다시 또 실행하면 됨\n과거에 아쉬움이 있다면, 한 번 더 시도해서 아쉬움을 타파하면 그만이 아닐까 생각\n한 번에 잘 되었던 적이 없어서 이 생각을 기본적으로 가지고 있는 것 같음\n어떤 경험을 하고, 주기적으로 회고를 하면서 고민한다. 이 순간에 내가 왜 이 선택을 했지? 이때 뭐가 중요하다고 생각했지?\n        \n그 당시 기록이 있다면 그 기록을 보면서 다음엔 어떻게 해볼까를 고민한다\n의사 결정 자체에 집중하는 것보다, 의사 결정을 대하는 태도나 의사 결정을 하는 과정에 신경을 쓰게 됨\nPM을 위한 데이터 리터러시 강의에 의사 결정 파트가 있는데, 그때 의사 결정 TIP을 다음과 같이 공유했음\n        \n(1) 답을 내린다는 표현 대신 베팅한다는 표현하기 : 답을 내린다는 것은 너무 부담이 생김\n(2) 에너지 레벨 고려하기 : 결정을 내리는 과정은 에너지를 많이 소모한다. 에너지를 덜 소모하며 결정할 방법을 고민함(같이 진행하기 등)\n(3) 당연한 것은 없다 : 당연하다고 생각하지 말고 항상 다시 고민해 보기\n(4) 개인적인 의사 결정에선 과감히 도전하는 것도 방법 : 회사에서 결정하는 것은 보수적으로 갈 수 있지만, 개인 관점에선 개방적으로 해보는 것도 방법. 이런 시도가 나의 안전지대(Comfort Zone)를 넘어설 수 있게 됨\n(5) 결정했으면 그 결정이 좋은 결과를 내도록 노력하기 : 결정하고 아무것도 안 하는 것이 아닌 그게 되도록 하는 것이 중요함\n(6) 사람은 결정으로 인한 실패를 피하고 싶은 성향이 있다 : 결과에 대해 받아들이고, 어떻게 개선할지 생각해 보는 것이 더 중요한 것 같다\n(7) 큰 결정은 누구나 어렵다. 작은 결정부터 하나씩 : 작은 결정에서 점점 큰 결정으로 가자. 대표님들은 어떻게 결정하고 있는지 살펴보고 간접적으로 나라면? 생각해 보거나 대표님들이 어떤 결정을 어떤 흐름으로 했는지 물어보는 것도 방법\n의사 결정, 선택에 대한 원칙을 만들었다.\n        \n대표적인 원칙은 “만약 내일 내가 죽는데, 어떤 일을 하지 않아서 무덤 속에서 뛰쳐나올 것 같다면 지금 하자”\n            \n무덤 속에서 뛰쳐나올 것 같다고 하면 너무 답답해서 해야 할 것으로 생각한다. 그래서 “이거 무덤에서 뛰쳐나올 정도인가?”를 생각하는 편\n좋은 결정보단, 상황에서 적절한 결정만 존재한다고 생각함. 그리고 결정하고 그 후의 실행이 중요하다\n이런 결정 원칙을 여러 개 만들고 주기적으로 수정하면 된다\n또 다른 저의 원칙은 데이터 과학자 원칙에 작성되어 있음. 목차를 공유해 드리면\n            \n의도적으로 남다른 선택해보기\n주기적으로 일하는 목적 찾기\n제너럴리스트, 스페셜리스트 이분법으로 생각하지 않기\n업무도 메타인지하며 목적 중심으로 생각하기\n나의 세상 정의하기\n회사에서 필요한 일과 내 흥미를 일치시키기\n팀 현황을 파악해서 개선점 만들기\n더 나은 커뮤니케이션 능력 기르기\n비즈니스 모델과 데이터의 접점 분석하기\n지금 힘들다면 여유가 있는지 생각해보기\n정리하면 좋은 의사 결정에 집중하는 것이 아닌 현재 상황이 어떤지, 지표로 표시해보고, 앞으로 뭘 해야할지 멘탈 시뮬레이션을 한 후에 결정한다. 결정을 한 후엔, 결정이 잘 될 수 있도록 노력함\n        \n순간 순간엔 좋지 않다고 판단할 수 있지만, 시간이 지나면서 경험이 쌓이면 그런 경험들이 좋은 순간이 될 수 있음\n그래서 이 결정이 좋은가에 대해 생각하지 않게 된 것 같음. 그냥 내게 있는 정보를 가지고 최선의 수를 두고, 계속 고민할 뿐\n\n\n4) 번아웃이 오면 어떻게 해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n요즘 너무 번아웃이 심하거나 힘든 경우 이런 고민을 하게 된다\n제 생각\n    \n살다 보면 또 번아웃이 올 수 있다. 물론 회사에서 번아웃이 안 오는 사람들도 있고, 적당히 잘 유지하는 사람들도 있다. 어떤 경우엔 번아웃이었는데 시간이 지나고 깨닫는 경우도 있음\n번아웃은 열심히 한 사람이 온다고 생각한다\n        \n일단 번아웃을 인정하기\n번아웃을 나쁘게 생각하지 말고 긍정적으로 승화하기\n잘 하고 있고, 잘 하다가 에너지가 부족해서 번아웃이 된 것. 에너지만 잘 채우면 된다\n번아웃 원인 분석하기\n        \n번아웃이 왜 오게 되었는가를 생각함\n회사의 일이 많아서 그럴 수도 있고, 개인 약속이 너무 많아서 그럴 수도 있고, 제대로 쉬지 못해서, 다른 사람들은 잘 하는데 내가 상대적으로 뒤처진다고 생각해서 등 다양한 이유가 있음\n여러 이유가 있을 수 있는데, 그 이유를 천천히 보면서 어떤 요인이 나를 이렇게 만들었는지 살펴본다. 과거의 경험과 비슷하면 그 요소가 내게 더 영향을 미칠 수 있다고 생각한다\n번아웃을 겪을 때 기록을 자주 해놓고, 번아웃에 대해 한판 정리를 했음\n        \n나만의 번아웃 패턴을 통해 어떻게 해야 해소할 수 있는지도 알 수 있게 되었음\n인스타그램에 번아웃에 빠졌을 때 번아웃을 극복하는 10가지 방법이란 글을 작성했음\n\n번아웃과 관련되는 것이 잘 쉬는 것\n    \n잘 쉬어야 번아웃도 안 온다고 생각함\n그래서 나만의 쉼 전략에 대해서도 고민했음. 잘 쉬는 법에 대한 고찰\n내가 언제 어떤 환경에 있어야 잘 쉰다고 생각하는지, 에너지가 채워지는지 등을 보고 정리함\n이런 것들이 정리되니까 내가 에너지가 없으면 바로 그 행동을 하면 됨\n청소하기 : 5 회복, 해외여행 가기 : 50 회복 등 이렇게 나만의 숫자를 채워봤다(숫자는 나중에 바뀔 수 있음)\n너무 힘든 경우엔 아무것도 안 해도 괜찮음. 그런 시기도 충분히 있을 수 있고, 잘 회복에 집중해야 함\n    \nIT 업계에 있으면서 성장 지향적으로 살아야 한다는 말을 많이 듣는다. 나도 그렇게 살아왔는데, 어느 순간 너무 성장 성장!보다 나만의 삶을 정의하고 그런 삶을 형성하면 된다고 생각했다\n이런 삶을 형성하는 과정에선 직무 관점에서 발전을 덜 할 수도 있음. 그러나 이게 문제는 아니라고 생각함\n힘들 땐 잘 회복하는 것도 중요함. 회복하는 시기엔 회복에 집중하는 것을 추천\n저 또한 6~7년 차 시절에, 회복에 집중했던 시기가 있음. 성장이란 것은 누적치라 생각해서 그냥 버티기만 해도 유지될 수 있어서 괜찮다고 생각함\n정리하면 번아웃의 원인을 분석해보고, 나의 번아웃 경험을 한판 정리한 후 앞으로 어떻게 번아웃에 빠질 수 있을지 도식을 그림. 또한 어떻게 쉬어야 할지에 대해서도 같이 생각함\n\n\n그 외에 자주 나오는 고민, 질문\n여러분들은 경력을 쌓으면서 어떤 고민을 하고 계신가요? 고민들도 궁금하네요\n또 자주 나오는 질문들은 다음과 같음. 다음에 시간이 될 때 아래 내용으로 글을 작성해보려고 함\n    \n혹 다른 질문이 있다면 댓글 남겨주시면 참고해서 글을 작성해 볼게요\n추가로 자주 받는 질문들\n    \n제가 잘하고 있는지 확인하려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n시간 관리는 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n새로운 트렌드는 어떻게 따라가야 할까요?\n기술을 추구하는게 맞을까요? 어떤 기술을 공부해야 할까요?\n이직은 언제 해야 할까요?\n전 물경력인 것 같아요\n정리\n위에 나온 것은 모두 제 생각이고 정답은 아니라고 생각함. 사람마다 다르게 생각할 수 있는 주제\n제 이야기의 핵심은 나에 대해 인지(메타인지)하기, 나의 목표(비전) 정해보기, 계속 시도하기, 나만의 원칙 만들기\n\n\n글 작성하는데 걸린 시간 : 75분\n    \n하고자 하는 이야기, 개요 정리 : 8분\n초안 글 작성 : 52분\n클로드/Cursor와 셀프 글 피드백 : 5분\n2차 글 작성 : 10분",

Bridging the Gap Between Community and Contributing Orgs\r\r\n\r\r\n![7.jpg](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/7.jpg)\r\r\n\r\r\n강의 형태로 진행되는 세션이 아닌 참석자들과 함께 자유롭게 토의하는 포럼 형태의 세션도 제공되었습니다. 그중 하나인 **Bridging the Gap Between Community and Contributing Orgs**은 오픈 소스 커뮤니티를 더욱 활성화하기 위해 자유롭게 의견을 공유하는 자리였습니다. 주요 논의는 신규 기여자와 기존 기여자가 모두를 위한 커뮤니케이션을 활성화하고 기여자 경험을 개선하기 위한 방안을 논의하는 세션이었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n다양한 국가의 수많은 사람들이 오픈인프라 프로젝트에 기여하고 있는 만큼 커뮤니케이션의 한계를 극복하고 다양성을 높이고자하는 열정이 느껴지는 세션이었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## OpenStack’s Role in the Future\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n오픈인프라 서밋 아시아 2024는 클라우드 산업의 혁신을 선도하는 오픈소스 커뮤니티의 중요성을 다시 한 번 강조한 행사였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n특히 VMware에서 오픈스택으로의 마이그레이션이 주목을 받으면서 확장 가능하고, 안전하며, 비용 효율적인 솔루션으로 오픈스택을 도입하려는 기업들이 전 세계적으로 많다는 것을 느낄 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n또한, AI와 같은 고성능 컴퓨팅을 위한 지속 가능한 인프라에 대한 요구가 커지고 있는 상황에서, 오픈인프라 커뮤니티는 혁신적이고 획기적인 솔루션으로 이러한 글로벌 과제에 대응할 준비가 충분히 갖추어져 있음을 확인할 수 있었습니다. 이번 서밋을 통해 오픈소스 기반 인프라의 미래와 지속 가능한 기술 개발에 대한 기대감이 더욱 커졌습니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새 VC들이 소비재 쪽의 사업은 상당히 보수적으로 검토하거나 아예 투자하지 않는 것 같은데, 우린 이런 분위기와는 상관없이 계속 이 분야에서 재미있는 일을 하고 있는 창업가들을 만나고, 투자하고 있다. 최근에도 생필품, 의류, 그리고 음식 분야에서 사업하고 있는 여러 창업가를 만났다. 자체 브랜드를 만들어서 직접 고객에게 자사몰, 그리고 다른 온라인 플랫폼이나 오프라인 유통 채널을 통해서 판매하고 있는데, 대부분 내가 이 글에서 말했던 그런 어려움을 사업의 단계와는 상관없이 직접 경험하고 있는 것 같았다.\n이분들과 이야기를 하면, 항상 등장하는 주재가 ‘해자(垓字)’이다. 사업의 종류에 상관없이 VC들이 창업가들에게 물어보는 게 그 사업만의 차별점, 진입장벽, 보호 장벽, 해자 관련 질문인데, “지금까지 비슷한 사업을 여러 번 검토했는데, 모두 다 비슷한 방식으로 비슷한 비즈니스 모델로 같은 시장에서 경쟁하는 것 같네요. 우리가 다른 경쟁사보다 더 잘할 수 있는, 우리만의 해자가 있나요?” , “이 사업이 잘되면 분명히 대기업도 같은 사업을 할 텐데요, 그 상황에서 우리가 이길 수 있는 우리만의 해자가 있을까요?”와 같은 유의 질문이다. 솔직히 이 질문에 대한 정답은 없다. 만약, 이 질문에 대한 답변이 투자에 결정적인 영향을 미친다면, 이런 질문을 한 VC는 결국엔 이 사업에 투자하지 않겠다는 의미다. 비슷한 분야에서 경쟁하는 회사들이 투자자를 설득할 만한 명확하고 논리적인 해자를 갖추긴 어렵고 – 특히, 이제 막 시작하는 초기 스타트업은 – 대기업이 이 분야에 진출했을 때 다윗 같은 스타트업이 골리앗 같은 대기업을 이길만한 해자는 없기 때문이다. 아니, 이론적으로 명확하고 논리적인 상상 속의 해자가 있더라도, 아마도 투자자는 이 말을 믿지 않을 것이다.\n특히나, 기술력이 뒷받침되는 소프트웨어 회사가 아니라, 공장에서 뭔가를 만들어서 판매하는 브랜드나 D2C 회사들은 이런 해자를 만드는 건 거의 불가능하다. 우리도 이 분야에서 사업하는 한국과 미국 회사에 꽤 많이 투자하면서 이 힘든 현실을 간접적으로 경험했고, 나는 몇 년 전부터 이런 현실을 인정하기 시작했다. 그리고, 이제 브랜드를 만드는 사업 분야에서 해자라는 건 존재하지 않는다는 걸 잘 받아들이고 있고, 아예 이 분야에서 사업하는 창업가들에겐 본인이 하는 사업의 해자는 무엇인지라는 질문을 하지 않는다.\n최근에 우리가 투자한 이런 D2C/브랜드 사업들을 보자: 제주 귤을 원료로 주스와 같은 다양한 시트러스 제품을 만드는 귤메달; 파워레이드나 게토레이드랑 같은 카테고리에 속한 기능성 스포츠 드링크 얼티밋포텐셜을 만드는 어센트스포츠; 그리고 반려동물을 위한 영양제 페노비스를 만드는 노즈워크. 모두 다 잘하고 있는 스타트업이지만, 다른 스타트업도 충분히 이 분야로 들어올 수 있고, 돈/시간/인력이 압도적으로 많은 대기업도 진출할 수 있는 매력적이고 규모가 나오는 시장이다. 이런 무시무시한 회사들이 우리 투자사들과 경쟁하기 시작하면 우리 창업가들은 어떤 해자를 만들면서 이길 수 있을까?\n정답은, 이들이 구축할 수 있는 해자는 없다. 이 치열한 분야에서 이기기 위해선 수단과 방법을 가리지 말고 모든 합법적인 방법을 동원해야 하고, 되도록 많은 소비자들의 눈에 노출되고, 그냥 무조건 많이 팔아서 매출 잘 만들어야 한다. 어떻게 많이 팔고, 어떻게 매출을 많이 만들 수 있을까? 이 또한 정답도 없고, 이를 위한 해자라는 것도 없다. 그냥 좋은 제품 만들고, 최대한 많은 채널을 통해서 유통하고, 동시에 마케팅도 잘 해야 한다. 나중에, 아주 나중에, 혹시나 자체 공장을 만들거나 우리 제품을 OEM 제조하는 공장을 인수해서 생산의 전 과정을 수직통합 할 수 있다면, 어쩌면 이건 품질관리, 공정관리, 수량 조정, 가격 조정 면에서 우리에게 해자가 될 수도 있다. 그런데 자체 공장에 대해서 고민하는 단계까지 왔다면, 이미 우린 시장에서 알아주고 인정해 주는 브랜드가 됐을 것이고, 여기에서 말한 대로, 특정 분야에서 가장 먼저 떠오르는 브랜드가 됐다면, 이 자체가 엄청난 해자가 될 수 있다.\n하지만, 누구나 다 아는 그 강력한 브랜드가 되기 전까지는, 해자라는 건 존재하지 않으니, 자꾸 우리만의 차별점이나 해자를 만들기 위해서 고민하지 말고, 그 시간에 그냥 물건 하나라도 더 팔아라. 대신, 남들보다 더 빠르게 움직이고, 너무 깊이 생각하기보단 get things done 전략으로 실행에 집중해라.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "영어에서 많이 사용하는 문장 중 “You are in good hands”라는 말이 있다. 말 그대로 믿을만한 손이 나를 잘 잡고 있으니 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 된다는 의미다. 다양한 상황에서 이 말을 하는데, 비즈니스 상황 외에 내가 가장 많이 이 말을 들었던 건 미국 영화나 드라마에서 주인공이 적진에 침투해서 인질을 구출하면서 안심시키는 장면이 아닐까 싶다. 나도 영어로 대화할 땐 이 말을 꽤 자주 사용하는데, 투자자로서 내가 우리 투자사 대표님들에게 주로 하는 말이다.\n스트롱이 첫 번째 기관 투자를 했다면, 이 스타트업의 대표에게 “우리가 한국에서 투자를 제일 잘하는 VC도 아니고, 우리한테 투자를 받으면 회사가 꼭 성공하는 것도 아니지만, 그래도 you are in good hands 입니다. 저희는 회사들이 힘들 때 뒤에서 같이 고민하고 같이 궂은일을 할 준비가 되어 있는 투자자예요.”라는 말을 자주 한다. 우리 투자사 중 80% 이상이 우리가 첫 번째 기관투자를 했으니, 대부분의 대표님들에게 이런 말을 한다고 봐도 된다.\n솔직히 한국어로 “우리랑 같이 하니까 앞으론 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 됩니다.”라고 말하는 거랑 영어로 “You are in good hands”라고 하는 거랑 느낌이나 어감이 많이 다르긴 하다. 영어로 하는 게 임팩트가 훨씬 더 크긴 한데, 어쨌든 이 말은 내가 투자자로서 창업가들에게 자주 하는 말이다.\n그런데 얼마 전에 이 반대의 상황을 경험했다. 우리가 여러 번 투자한 스타트업의 대표가 나한테 “You are in good hands.”라고 했는데, 이 말을 듣고 뭔가 기분이 묘하긴 했다. 기분이 묘했다는 게 나빴다는 건 전혀 아니고, 오히려 그 반대였다. 내가 항상 불안해하는 창업가분들에게 이 말을 하면, 이분들의 표정이 조금은 더 편해지고, 심적으로 안정감을 찾는 것 같았는데, 나도 그런 느낌이 들었다고나 할까? “아, 이 말을 들으니, 이런 기분이 드네. 좋구먼.” 뭐, 이런 생각을 했던 것 같다.\n그 회사의 자세한 상황에 대해서 여기서 말하진 않겠다. 그런데 모든 스타트업이 그렇듯이 항상 돈은 없고, 항상 사업은 불안하고, 항상 원하는 수치는 안 나오는, 그런 전형적인 초기 스타트업이 대부분 거치는 긴 어둠의 터널을 지나는 중이었다. 우리는 사업을 직접 하는 사람은 아니지만, 이런 힘든 시기를 겪고 있는 창업가들과 워낙 많이 교류하다 보니, 이들과의 대화 속에서 항상 우리의 걱정과 근심이 직간접적으로 반영된다. 그날도 이야기하면서 이런 나의 우려가 표출됐던 것 같은데, 이분이 나를 똑바로 보면서, “걱정하지 마세요. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 했다. 이 말을 듣고 정말로 얼마나 안심이 되던지, 아마도 그분은 잘 모를 것이다.\n그래서 어느 순간부터 나는 우리에게 자금을 제공해 주는 해외 LP 분들이 글로벌 경기, 한국의 경기, 북한, 스트롱의 포트폴리오, 스트롱의 어려운 상황들 등에 대해서 우려를 표시하면, “Don’t worry. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 하기 시작했다. 우리의 창업가분들이 우리에게 큰 안심을 제공하듯이, 내가 하는 이 말도 우리의 LP들에게 큰 안심을 줄 수 있길 바란다.",

ASCAP(미국 음악 저작권협회), BMI(방송음악협회), GMR(Global Music Rights) 및 SESAC 같은 공연 권리 단체들이 포함된다.\n\n미국의 음악 산업 전문 법무/컨설팅 회사인 매나트, 펠프스 앤 필립스(Manatt, Phelps & Phillips)는 음원 로열티를 지급하는 다수의 기업을 조사한 데이터를 기반으로 ‘.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}음악 스트리밍 로열티 계산기’를 만들었다. 복잡한 수식은 뒤로 숨기고, 스포티파이나 애플뮤직의 재생수를 입력하면 총매출의 추정치가 나오는 계산기다. 추정치일 뿐이지만 대략 얼마 정도의 매출을 거뒀는지 짐작할 수는 있다.\n이제 ⟨APT.⟩의 숫자를 입력할 차례다. 이 노래는 전 세계 기준으로 단 2주 만에 스포티파이에서 1억 8,336만 9,499회 재생됐다. 사실 이 계산기는 미국 내 스트리밍 로열티만 계산하기 때문에 전 세계 누적 스트리밍 횟수를 그대로 넣으면 안 되지만(미국 내 스트리밍 횟수와 국가별 환율도 고려해야 하므로) 우리의 목적은 추정치를 확인하는 것이므로, 그냥 무식하게 이대로 넣어보자.\n결괏값은 두 개다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}.css-wgpbp3{display:block;margin-top:6px;}로제와 브루노 마스의 ⟨APT.⟩를 음악 스트리밍 로열티 계산기에 넣어본 결괏값 \n스포티파이는 87만 7,932달러(약 12억 1,198만 원)를, 애플뮤직은 155만 7,129달러(약 21억 4,961만 원)를 로열티로 제공한 것으로 추정된다. 음원이 발매된 지 단 2주 만에 33억 원의 매출을 낸 것이다. 물론 로제와 브루노 마스가 이 돈을 다 가져가는 건 아니다. 이들은 여기서 작곡, 작사, 편곡, 가창의 몫을 가져갈 것이다. 글로벌에서 성공한 히트곡이란 대략 이 정도의 매출을 만드는군, 이라는 참고 자료다. 그런데 모두가 스트리밍으로 이렇게 돈을 벌 수 있을까? 이건 정말 예외적인 경우가 아닐까?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}스트리밍이 정말 돈이 될까?\n스트리밍 시장은 계속 성장하고 있다. 2023년 기준 전 세계 음악 스트리밍 시장 규모는 364억 9,000만 달러로 추정된다. 50조 569억 8,200만 원 정도의 규모다. 2023년부터 2031년까지의 음악 스트리밍 시장의 연평균 성장률(CAGR)은 8.7%를 기록할 것으로 전망되고, 규모도 거의 두 배에 달하는 713억 2,000만 달러에 이를 것으로 예상된다. 스트리밍 이전 시대와 비교하면 사실상 그 규모*를 넘어선 수치다.\n*세계 음악시장 매출은 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}1999년 278억 달러를 기록한 뒤, 2011년까지 12년 연속 감소했다.\n지금이야말로 음악을 사랑하는 사람들이 늘 꿈꾸던 ‘음악으로 충만한 세상’이다. 하지만 그 결과는 우리의 상상과는 완전히 다르다. 스포티파이에 등록된 음악은 1억 곡이 넘지만, 한 번도 재생되지 않은 곡도 수백만 곡에 이른다. 에드 시런과 테일러 스위프트는 2022년까지 스포티파이에서 약 7~8천만 달러를 정산받았지만, 어떤 싱어송라이터는 1년에 100달러 미만을 정산받는다.\n시장이 성장하면서 잠재적 기회는 많아졌지만, 대부분의 수익은 상위 10% 미만의 메이저에게 돌아간다. 소위 ‘메이저’라고 불리는 이들도 모두가 큰돈을 버는 건 아니다. 더 많은 재생 수를 위해서는 더 큰 비용을 써야 하고, 그마저도 지속 가능하고 안정적인 수익을 약속해 주지 않기 때문이다.\n만약 ⟨APT.⟩가 1980년대처럼 5,000원짜리 싱글 음반으로 판매됐다면 12억 1,198만 5,126원의 매출을 위해 1억 8,336만 9,499회의 스트리밍 대신 24만 장의 CD를 파는 것으로 충분했을 것이다. 이처럼 실물 음반에 비하면 스트리밍의 수익성은 낮다. 그렇다면 이런 환경에서 ‘디지털 콘텐츠’ 형태의 음악은 어떤 역할을 하고 있을까?\n유명하지만 돈을 못 버는, 콘텐츠의 역설\n20세기에는 ‘콘텐츠’란 말 자체가 없었다. 콘텐츠의 사전적 의미는 ‘네트워크로 유통되는 멀티미디어 파일’이니까. 전자 네트워크가 생기고 콘텐츠란 말이 태어나기 전의 음악 사업은 음반을 판매하는 것이 거의 유일한 수익 모델이었다. 음악은 음반으로 듣고, 영화는 DVD로 보고, 게임은 게임 타이틀로 하고, 책은 책을 읽어야 했던 것처럼 다른 걸 고려할 수 없었기 때문이다.\n다시 말해 20세기의 음악 산업은 제조업이었다. 음반을 만들고 판매해서 돈을 벌었다. TV에 출연하거나 뮤직비디오를 만들거나 심지어 콘서트를 여는 것도 피지컬(physical) 음반을 판매하기 위한 홍보 활동이었다. (이는 영화, 게임, 출판도 마찬가지였다.)\n그런데 21세기에 디지털 전환이 일어나면서 물리적인 제품에서 멀티미디어가 분리되어 통신망으로 유통되기 시작했고, 음악과 게임의 비즈니스 모델이 무너지기 시작했다. (영화와 출판은 이제야 비슷한 문제를 겪는 중이다). 유선 인터넷, 무선 인터넷, LTE와 5G까지 네트워크 기술이 발전하는 동안 음악과 게임은 다운로드, 스트리밍, 구독 모델을 만들며 새로운 환경에 대응해 왔고, 게임 산업은 ‘인앱 결제’라는 방식으로 비즈니스 모델 문제를 해결하기도 했다.\n그런데 이건 유통 및 공급자의 입장이다. 실제로 음악이나 게임을 만드는 저작권자들은 늘어난 경쟁과 줄어든 수익성의 틈에서 버티기 어려워지고 있다. 음악(콘텐츠)의 초과 공급 아래 콘텐츠 판매 수익은 0에 수렴하기 때문이다. 스포티파이에 하루 동안 업로드되는 신곡의 수, 유튜브에 1분 동안 업로드되는 콘텐츠의 개수, 1년에 발간되는 책의 권수, 킨들에서 발행되는 전자책의 양, 넷플릭스에 업로드되는 비디오 개수… 이 모든 숫자들은 커지고 있지만, 저작권자에게 돌아가는 수익은 적어지고 있다는 점에서 그야말로 풍요 속의 빈곤이다.\n앞서 언급한 ⟨APT.⟩의 사례처럼 ‘유명해지면 되는 것 아닌가?’라고 생각할 수 있다. 하지만 일단 넘치는 콘텐츠 시대에서 유명해지기 위해서는 (매우 운이 좋지 않은 이상) 돈이 많이 들 수밖에 없다. 수많은 콘텐츠 중에서 사람들의 높은 관심을 끌어야 하기 때문이다. 앞서 우리는 스포티파이를 통해 발생한 매출이 12억 원 정도일 것으로 추정했다.\n그런데 제작비는 얼마였을까? 2020년에 니키 미나즈의 피처링 가격이 곡당 6억 원 정도였다는 자료를 참고해, 2024년 브루노 마스의 피처링 비용은 적어도 10억 원이 들었을 것으로 예상해 보자. 그 외 작곡, 편곡, 레코딩, 뮤직비디오 제작비와 마케팅 비용 등을 감안한다면 ⟨APT.⟩ 한 곡의 제작비는 최소 15억 원으로 추정해 볼 수 있을 것이다.\n이렇게 돈을 써서 스트리밍 차트에서 1위를 했더라도, 유명세를 수익으로 전환하는 건 정말 어렵다. 음악이 좋다고 모두가 음반을 구매하거나 공연장에 가는 건 아니기 때문이다. 이런 상황에서 스트리밍만으로 손익분기점을 넘는 건 일반적으로 쉽지 않다. 음악 산업에서의 깔때기 구조*에 따르면, 추상적인 인기를 구체적인 사업으로 전환하는 건 매우 복잡하다. 이게 바로 ‘콘텐츠의 역설’, 유명한데 돈을 못 버는 상황이다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n💡 음악 산업에서의 깔때기 구조 \n\n소비자 행동 이론 중에 고객 퍼널 구조, 혹은 깔때기 구조라고 불리는 모델이 있다. 잠재적 소비자가 고객으로 변해 가는 과정을 분석하는 도구로, 음악에 빗대면 다음과 같다. \n\n음악에서 깔때기 구조는 스트리밍→음악→콘서트로 심화된다. 여기서 스트리밍은 관여도가 낮은 첫 단계다. 그 후 여러 요인들(듣기에 좋아서, 화제가 되어서, 추천곡으로 떠서 등) ‘좋아요’를 누르고 팔로우를 하면서 관여도가 높은(돈을 쓸 가능성이 높은) 고객으로 전환되고, 음반을 구매하거나 콘서트에도 올 수 있는 고객이 된다.\n\n그럼에도 스트리밍이 중요한 이유\n그렇다면 스트리밍 차트 1위는 수익과 관련해서는 아무런 쓸모도 없는 걸까? 아니, 그럼에도 차트 1위라는 화제는 여전히 필요하다. 스트리밍 차트 성적은 더 많은 기회를 만들기 때문이다. ⟨APT.⟩의 1위로 로제가 얻을 기회는 대략 다음과 같다.\n\n후속곡의 성공: ⟨APT.⟩는 로제가 올해 말에 발매할 솔로 1집의 선공개 싱글이었다. ⟨APT.⟩의 성공으로 이후 발표될 곡들에 대한 기대감이 높아졌고 수록곡들도 큰 인기를 얻을 수 있다.\n로제의 섭외비: 방송 출연료, 페스티벌 섭외비, 광고 출연료, 피처링 비용 등이 상승한다.\n로열티 정산 비율이 달라질 수 있다.\n\n이렇게 보면 스트리밍은 단순히 깔때기 구조의 하단에 위치하는 게 아닌, 기회비용을 높이는 전략이 된다. 이 과정에서 팬의 역할이 무엇보다 중요하다. 스트리밍은 팬을 만드는 도구이기도 하지만, 동시에 팬들이 스트리밍에 영향을 주기도 하기 때문이다.\n일반적으로 팬은 음악을 발표하고 활동을 지속하는 과정에서 만들어진다고 여겨졌다. 그러나 지금은 처음부터 팬이 필요하다. 1화에서 말했듯 팬은 소비자나 부가 가치가 아닌, 수익 그 자체를 만드는 존재이면서 산업을 지탱하는 기반이기 때문이다. 과거의 음악 산업이 팬을 아티스트 활동의 결과물로 여겼다면, 지금의 음악 산업은 팬을 처음부터 필요한 존재로 여긴다. 그렇기 때문에 데뷔와 함께, 혹은 데뷔 전에 이미 팬을 모을 수 있는 방법론을 고민한다. 신인 팀을 위한 오디션, 데뷔 전의 소셜 미디어 활동 등이 바로 그중 일부다.\n이렇게 처음부터 만들어진 팬은 (일반 소비자와 다르게) 아티스트와 밀도 높은 관계를 형성하고, 그로부터 지속 가능한 성장을 만든다. 미디어가 산산이 쪼개진 현재, 팬들은 자신의 취향과 맞는 콘텐츠를 찾아가며 그 과정에서 본인이 직접 브이로그 등의 콘텐츠를 제작해 아티스트를 알리는가 하면, 스트리밍 순위를 올리기 위한 집단행동을 하며 기업의 미디어 비용을 줄이는 역할도 맡는다.\n하지만 우리는 로제도, 브루노 마스도 아닌데 어떻게 팬을 만들 수 있을까? 여기에 정답은 없다. 당신이 뮤지션이라면 오디션 프로그램을 통해 팬을 만들 수도 있지만, 인스타그램 라이브나 소셜 미디어 활동 등을 통해 먼저 팬을 만들 수도 있다. 음악을 먼저 발표하는 게 아니라 여러 활동으로 팬을 구한 다음, 진짜 하고 싶은 것을 하는 시대가 온 것이다.\n음악에만 국한되는 얘기는 아니다. 영화도, 게임도, 글을 쓰는 저자도 마찬가지다. 지금 팬이 필요한 상황이라면, 팬이 모이고 성장하는 5단계를 참고해 보길 바란다. 아래는 내가 직접 만든 팬의 행동 변화 5단계로, 팬 비즈니스의 기반이 되는 구조다.\n팬의 행동 변화 5단계 .css-hokoge{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;counter-reset:numberedList;}.css-hokoge ul,.css-hokoge ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-hokoge>li{counter-increment:numberedList;margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-hokoge>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-hokoge>li>span{position:relative;}.css-hokoge>li>span>:first-child::before{content:counter(numberedList) '.';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n접촉(contact): 미디어 노출로 콘텐츠를 접하는 단계\n몰입(dive): 팔로우, 검색 등을 통해 적극적이지만 가벼운 관계를 형성하는 단계\n재미(play): 공유를 통해 제3자에게 정보를 공유하는 즐거움을 느끼는 단계\n사랑(love): 깊어지는 관계를 통해 감정과 관계의 밀도가 높아지는 단계\n헌신(devotion): 자신의 안정적인 감정 상태를 지키기 위해 행동하는 단계\n\n좋은 마케팅으로 짧은 성과는 낼 수 있다. 그러나 지속적이고 안정적인 성과를 내기 위해서는 반드시 팬이 필요하다. 그게 우리가 해결해야 할 문제다. \n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 송수아 Graphic 이은호 이제현",

(1) 기업과 같은 생산자가 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우, (2) 소비자가 상품을 사용함으로써 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우입니다.\n예를 들어, 기업이 공정을 개선해 고효율 냉장고를 생산했다면 생산 과정에서 탄소 발자국을 감축했다 = 즉, 탄소 손자국을 늘렸다 볼 수 있는 것이고요. 소비자가 냉장고 사용 과정에서 전력 소비를 절감하기 위해 노력했다면 또 한 번 탄소 손자국을 확보한 것입니다.\n이처럼 저탄소 제품을 생산하고 사용하는 과정에서 줄인 온실가스 배출량은 해당 제품을 제공한 기업의 성과로 인정되며, 친환경 이미지를 강화하는 데에 기여할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}\"극적으로 탄소배출량 줄인 이 남자가 소·양 대신 먹은 것“\n(한겨례 21 2024.8.17)\n1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서가 나온 이후, 개별적으로 실험하는 시민들이 등장했다. 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는 2019년 보고서를 바탕으로 1년간 1t의 탄소만을 배출하는 삶을 시도했다. 처음엔 2050년 목표치인 0.7t에 도전했지만, 현재의 인프라로는 불가능하다고 판단해 1t으로 목표치를 바꾸고 성공했다. 올터는 리드헤드로부터 실험에 관한 이야기를 직접 듣고 실험에 참여하기로 결심했다. “사실 연간 1t은 불가능하다고 생각했어요. 연구소에서 제시한 (2030년 목표인) 2.5t을 목표로 해보기로 했죠.”\n연간 2.5t이라는 배출량도 하루로 치면 약 6.8㎏이다. 붉은 육류 위주의 한 끼 식사에서 배출되는 탄소가 약 7.7㎏ 정도이니, 연 배출 2.5t을 달성하기 위해선 먹거리부터 이동, 소비 등 삶의 전반적인 방식을 바꿔야 했다. 어떻게 가능했을까. 그의 첫 번째 전략은 교통수단의 변화였다. “북미 지역에서 발생하는 탄소배출량의 가장 큰 부분이 자동차입니다. 저는 1년 동안 운전을 완전히 포기했어요.”\n캐나다의 1명당 평균 탄소배출량 구성을 보면 교통이 35%로 가장 많다. 14.2t 중에 5t이 교통에서 배출된다. 올터가 운전을 포기할 수 있었던 이유는 부동산 개발업을 그만두고 환경 관련 웹사이트에 글을 올리는 작가 일을 시작했기 때문이다.\n“저는 운이 좋은 편이었어요. 집에서 일할 수 있었고 아이들도 근처에 있었고요. 제가 사는 도시는 쇼핑도 대부분 도보나 자전거로 할 수 있었어요. 또 대학에 강의를 나갈 때도 자전거를 타고 다닐 수 있었습니다.” 1년 동안 한 번 미국 뉴욕에 다녀온 것 외에는 비행기도 타지 않았다. 식단도 바꿨다. “고기를 포기하는 것은 어렵지만 소나 양을 포기하고 탄소 배출이 훨씬 적은 돼지와 닭만 먹는 것은 그리 어렵지 않았어요. 문제가 되는 건 소나 양과 같은 반추동물이죠.”(중략)\n\n\n전 세계적으로 기후변화에 대응하기 위한 목표는 ‘온실가스 배출을 크게 줄이는 것’입니다. ‘기후변화에 관한 정부간 협의체(IPCC)’는 지구의 온도를 1.5도 이하로 유지하기 위해서는, 개인이 3.4톤 이하의 탄소만 배출해야 한다고 발표했는데요. 이는 전체 온실가스 배출량을 인구 수로 나눈 단순 결과값이었습니다.\n하지만 2019년에 발표된 일본과 핀란드의 '1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서'는 더욱 현실적인 접근을 제안합니다. 각 개인의 생활 방식을 기준으로 탄소 배출을 분석한 것인데요. 보고서에 따르면, 전체 탄소 배출량의 72%가 가정에서의 소비와 관련 있으니 개인이 연간 2.5톤의 탄소만 배출하도록 더 노력해야 한다고 합니다. 더 나아가 2040년에는 1.4톤, 2050년에는 0.7톤까지 줄여야 한다고 했고요.\n기사에 나온 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는, 실제로 이 보고서에서 제안하는 방향으로 1년간 1톤의 탄소만 배출하는 삶에 도전했습니다. 기사의 또다른 주인공 로이드 올터도 2.5톤 이내로 탄소배출량을 줄이기 위해 이전과 완전히 다른 라이프스타일을 택했고요.\n그렇다면 개인이 배출하는 탄소 양을 줄이기 위해, 우리는 실생활에서 어떤 방법들을 실천해볼 수 있을까요?\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

바꾸기: 자동차 운전을 줄이고, 걷기, 자전거 타기, 대중교통 이용하기 등의 습관을 만들어 보세요. 특히 출퇴근할 때 자전거와 대중교통을 사용하면, 자연스럽게 운동이 되기 때문에 건강에도 좋습니다.\n식단 조절: 사육 과정에서 많은 탄소를 배출하는 소와 양 같은 붉은 고기 대신, 돼지나 닭 같이 탄소 배출이 적은 고기를 선택해 보세요. 더 나아가 채식 위주의 식사를 시도하는 것도 좋은 방법입니다.\n소비 습관 바꾸기: 전자제품과 의류 등의 제품을 최대한 오래 사용하고, 새로운 제품을 자주 구매하지 않도록 해요. 하나의 제품을 오래 사용하는 습관을 길러보는 것은 탄소 배출을 줄이는 데 큰 도움이 되겠죠.\n도시 환경 활용: 가까운 곳은 도보로 다니거나 자전거를 활용하는 등, 도시의 친환경적인 구조를 최대한 활용해 봅시다. 네덜란드와 같이 걷기, 자전거 타기에 최적화된 도시에서는 일상생활 속에서 자연스럽게 탄소 손자국을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 이처럼 도시 내 교통수단과 도보, 자전거 사용을 통해 배출량을 줄이는 습관은 탄소 손자국을 늘리는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n\n이렇게 개인의 작은 생활 습관 변화로도 탄소 손자국을 확대할 수 있답니다. 동시에 정부와 기업 역시 탄소 배출을 줄이기 위해 힘을 모아야 합니다. 정부는 탄소 배출을 줄일 수 있도록 도시 설계를 하고, 기업은 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출이 적으면서 친환경 제품을 만들기 위해 노력해야겠죠.\n탄소 손자국을 늘리는 것은 단순히 환경 보호를 위한 수단을 너머, 장기적으로 지구에서 살아가는 우리 모두가 함께 기후 변화에 대응하는 중요한 역할을 하게 될 것입니다.\n\n\n탄소 중립: 최종적으로 탄소 배출량이 ‘0’이 되도록 하는 것을 목표로 하는 개념. 배출한 만큼의 탄소를 흡수하거나 상쇄하는 방법을 함께 수행해요. 나무 심기 같은 활동이 이에 해당됩니다.\n지속 가능한 생활(Sustainable Living): 현 세대가 사용하는 자원이 미래 세대의 자원까지 고갈시키지 않도록, 환경을 생각하며 생활하는 방식. 일회용품을 줄이고 재활용하는 것, 새 제품을 계속 구입하는 것보다 하나의 제품이나 서비스를 오래도록 이용하는 것이 지속 가능한 생활을 실천하는 방법이 될 수 있겠죠.\n\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0
