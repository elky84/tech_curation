        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nThe Kotlin DataFrame library makes extracting values from structured data an easy task. As discussed in our documentation, there are four separate APIs that can be used for this purpose, with the optimal choice depending on your individual situation and requirements. \nTo demonstrate, let’s read in a JSON document containing information about users:\nval rawUserData = DataFrame.read(\"https://dummyjson.com/users\")\n   .getFrameColumn(\"users\")\n   .first()\n\nrawUserData.select { cols(0..2) }.head(3)\nThe final line selects the first three columns from the first three rows (for illustration purposes only):\n\n\n\n\nDon’t worry about how the final line works just yet – we’ll get to that later.\nHaving obtained our sample data, let’s now extract some values. In the example below, you:\nTake the last five users as strongly typed DataRow objects, using the tail operation.\nCapture each user’s name four times, using a different API each time.\nPrint the captured values, so you can be sure that they’re identical.\ndata class Person(val firstName: String)\n\nrawUserData.tail().forEach {\n   val name1 = firstName               // Extension Properties API\n   val name2 = \"firstName\"<String>()   // String API\n   val firstName by column<String>()   // Column Accessors API\n   val nameRef = Person::firstName     // KProperties API\n  \n   println(\"$name1 $name2 ${firstName()} ${this[nameRef]}\")\nThis should be the resultant output:\nEvelyn Evelyn Evelyn Evelyn\nDaniel Daniel Daniel Daniel\nLily Lily Lily Lily\nHenry Henry Henry Henry\nAddison Addison Addison Addison\nImpressive as this is, selecting individual values is not enough for real world scenarios. When using functions like select, remove, or update, you will typically need to select values from multiple columns. \nThese columns might all be at the top level, but when dealing with hierarchical data (like JSON), you’ll need to select columns from within nested column groups. This functionality is provided by the Columns Selection DSL.\nThe DataFrame library has always had a DSL for selecting multiple (potentially nested) columns, but in this release, we’ve added new functions and improved the overall syntax and readability. \nAn initial example of selection\nIn the example below, you:\nSelect the firstName column.\nUse the and operator to combine this column with further selections.\nAccess the nested data within the address column.\nUse the cols function to select multiple columns from the nested data.\nOnly keep the final five records via tail.\nrawUserData.select {\n   firstName and address.cols(\"city\", \"state\")\n}.tail()\nAs you can see from the results, you can use the and operator to select multiple columns individually, and the cols function to select multiple columns in one go.\n\n\n\n\nSelecting by index\nColumns can also be selected by index, with the first column having an index of zero. The code below would give you the same result:\nrawUserData.select {\n   firstName and address.cols(1, 2)\n}.tail()\nIf you were to include the column with index zero, then the results would include the street number and name. You could list the three indexes individually, but a range is more convenient:\nrawUserData.select {\n   firstName and address.cols(0..2)\n}.tail()\nThese would be the results:\n\n\n\n\nSelecting based on a predicate\nThe value passed to cols can also be a lambda. This allows you to select columns based on an arbitrary predicate – typically involving their name or content. Let’s look at two examples.\nThis first example selects all columns whose name ends with “Name”:\nrawUserData.select {\n   cols { it.name.contains(\".+Name\".toRegex()) }\n}.tail()\nAs you can see, this gives us three results:\n\n\n\n\nThe second example selects all columns whose values contain either the word “Lee” or the number 31.\nrawUserData.select {\n   cols { \"Lee\" in it.values() } and\n   cols { 31 in it.values() }\n}.tail()\nAs is visible below, this gives us two columns:\n\n\n\n\nHandling nested data\nWhat if you want to search within nested data? The function isValueColumn returns true if a column contains regular data. Otherwise the column is a column group or a frame column.\nThis test can be repeated recursively to descend the hierarchy. That sounds like a lot of work, but fortunately the library provides a colsAtAnyDepth function that handles the recursion for you. Let’s look at some examples.\nIn the code below, you select columns from anywhere in the column group hierarchy that contain regular data and have a name of length six:\nrawUserData.select {\n   colsAtAnyDepth {\n       it.name.length == 6 && it.isValueColumn()\n   }\n}.tail()\nThese are the results:\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, this code contains a bug. You cannot have multiple columns with the same name in the results. For example let’s say you search for columns of length four:\nrawUserData.select {\n   colsAtAnyDepth {\n       it.name.length == 4 && it.isValueColumn()\n   }\n}.tail()\nThe results will include two columns called “city” – one from the column group describing the user’s address, and the other from the column group describing the address of the company the user works for. This duplication will cause an exception to be raised:\nDuplicate column names: [city]\n\nAll column names: [type, city, iban, name, city, coin, role]\norg.jetbrains.kotlinx.dataframe.exceptions.DuplicateColumnNamesException: Duplicate column names: [city]\nThe solution is to create a new version of the data, where the column names encode the full path down the hierarchy:\nval renamedUserData = rawUserData.rename {\n   colsAtAnyDepth()\n}.into { it.path.joinToString(\".\") }\nYou can query this new data to see how the column names have changed:\nrenamedUserData.select {\n   colsAtAnyDepth()\n}.columnNames().forEach(::println)\nFor example, these are the columns relating to the address of the user:\naddress\naddress.address\naddress.city\naddress.state\naddress.stateCode\naddress.postalCode\naddress.coordinates\naddress.coordinates.lat\naddress.coordinates.lng\naddress.country\nIf you now select columns you will need to split up the column name:\nrenamedUserData.select {\n   colsAtAnyDepth {\n       val isLength6 = it.name.split(\".\").last().length == 6\n       isLength6 && it.isValueColumn()\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nThe benefit is that searching by length 4 no longer produces an exception:\nrenamedUserData.select {\n   colsAtAnyDepth {\n       val isLength4 = it.name.split(\".\").last().length == 4\n       isLength4 && it.isValueColumn()\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nNote that colsAtAnyDepth replaces the dfs and recursively functions, which have now been deprecated and removed.\nProcessing data by column order\nMost of the specificities of Column Selection DSL will be intuitive to folks who have experience with SQL. However, there is one area that might catch them off guard. Unlike in relational database theory (RDT), the order of the columns in a DataFrame is significant, and can be used in queries.\nWe already saw this with the example of indexing, but ordering can be used in many ways. Let’s try to find all of the top-level columns whose name begins with the letter “i”:\nrawUserData.select {\n   cols {\n       it.name.startsWith(\"i\")\n   }\n}.tail()\nYou can see that there are three such columns:\n\n\n\n\nUnlike in SQL, it’s meaningful to ask which column comes first:\nrawUserData.select {\n   first {\n       it.name.startsWith(\"i\")\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nBy that logic, it’s also meaningful to ask which column comes last:\nrawUserData.select {\n   last {\n       it.name.startsWith(\"i\")\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nYou can even traverse across the columns, selecting all columns until a specified one is reached or a condition is met. In the example below you select all columns until you encounter the first one whose name starts with “e”:\nrawUserData.select {\n   allUpTo {\n       first {\n           it.name.startsWith(\"e\")\n       }\n   }\n}.tail()\nIn our sample data, this is the column named “email”:\n\n\n\n\nAdditional helper functions\nThere are a number of helper functions you can explore, which simplify common scenarios. Let’s explore three examples.\nThe valueCols function \nThis function only selects value columns. That means we can take this earlier example:\nrawUserData.select {\n   cols {\n       it.name.length == 6 && it.isValueColumn()\n   }\n}.tail()\nAnd simplify it into:\nrawUserData.select {\n   valueCols {\n       it.name.length == 6\n   }\n}.tail()\nBoth will produce the following results:\n\n\n\n\nIf you did not exclude nested data, then the users cryptocurrency information will be included as well:\nrawUserData.select {\n   cols {\n       it.name.length == 6\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nThe colsOfKind function\nThis function lets you select any combination of group, frame, and value columns. If you only wanted to find the names of the group columns you could do this:\nrawUserData.select {\n   colsOfKind(ColumnKind.Group)\n}.first().run {\n   columnNames().forEach(::println)\n}\nIn which case, the results are:\nhair\naddress\nbank\ncompany\ncrypto\nAlternatively, you could select group and value columns like this:\nrawUserData.select {\n   colsOfKind(ColumnKind.Group, ColumnKind.Value)\n}.first().run {\n   columnNames().forEach(::println)\n}\nBecause the scope of the query is wider, more results will be selected:\naddress\nmacAddress\nuniversity\nbank\ncompany\nein\nssn\nuserAgent\ncrypto\nrole\nThe colsOf function\nIn the DataFrame library every column created infers its type based on the data inside. This being the case, you can select columns based on the type of data they contain:\nrawUserData.select {\n   colsOf<Int>()\n}.tail()\nIn this example, the top level data contains two columns holding integer values:\n\n\n\n\nThe colsOf function is polymorphic, meaning that it will select columns whose data type is a subtype of the type you specify. For example, if you specify Number as the type, then columns containing both integer and floating-point values will be selected. \nrawUserData.select {\n   colsOf<Number>()\n}.tail()\nIn this case, that gives us an additional two columns:\n\n\n\n\nIf you wanted, you could create a new version of the data, where all numeric values were doubles. This could be achieved as follows:\nval convertedUserData = rawUserData.convert {\n   colsAtAnyDepth().colsOf<Number>()\n}.toDouble()\nNow, selecting the integer columns would give us no results, whereas selecting all the doubles would give us four:\nconvertedUserData.select {\n   colsOf<Double>()\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nOperators and subtracting columns\nThe square brackets operator can be used as a shortcut for the cols function. Consider the following example:\nrawUserData.select {\n   bank.cols {\n       it.name.startsWith(\"card\")\n   }\n}.tail()\nThis selects the nested data within the “bank” column, specifically all those columns whose name starts with “card”:\n\n\n\n\nYou can achieve the same result using the operator as follows:\nrawUserData.select {\n   bank[{ it.name.startsWith(\"card\") }]\n}.tail()\nWhich syntax you prefer is a matter of personal preference, but consistency is recommended to avoid confusing your code’s maintainers.\nIt’s also possible to select columns by subtraction, rather than addition. To show this, let’s create a simpler data set:\nval employeeData = rawUserData.mapToFrame {\n   \"name\" from { \"$firstName $lastName\" }\n   university into \"education\"\n   \"employment\" from { \"${company.title} at ${company.name}\" }\n   +birthDate\n   +email\n}.tail()\nThis gives us the following values:\n\n\n\n\nYou already know how to specify which columns you want:\nemployeeData.select {\n   cols(name, employment, birthDate)\n}\nBut it’s also possible to obtain the same result by specifying which columns you wish to leave out:\nemployeeData.select {\n   allExcept(email, education)\n}.tail()\nBoth of these examples give the following result:\n\n\n\n\nSubtraction can be used when working with nested data. In the example below, you return to the original data set and select the user’s first name and all elements of their address with three exceptions:\nrawUserData.select {\n   firstName and\n   address.allColsExcept {\n       cols(coordinates, stateCode, postalCode)\n   }\n}.tail()\n\n\n\n\nInteractive grammars\nAs you can see, there’s a huge amount of functionality within the Column Selection DSL. When you first encounter the library, it’s easy to be confused by both the number of operations and the different ways in which they can be combined. \nTo assist with this, we now provide grammars for each function in the associated KDocs. You might have encountered these grammars on the website already, but in KDocs, they’re fully interactive!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nHopefully this blog has given you some insight into the power and versatility of the Column Selection DSL. This latest (0.13.1) update brings a more organized and consistent way to select columns with detailed and interactive documentation. All examples from this article are available as a Kotlin Notebook on GitHub. \nAs always, we’re keen to receive feedback on our products, and what areas could be extended or improved. You can find more information about column selectors on this page of our Kotlin DataFrame documentation site. Each function is introduced with examples and explanations, which is a great way to get an overview of what’s possible. Happy coding!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are delighted to announce that, starting with the 2024.2 Early Access Program (EAP), IntelliJ-based IDEs will offer preliminary support for the Wayland display server protocol on Linux, including Windows Subsystem for Linux a.k.a. WSLg.\nHow To Opt In\nOn Linux, IntelliJ-based IDEs were using exclusively the X11 protocol and an X server to show their user interface (UI), even if you were running a Wayland-based desktop. All Wayland servers include an X server implementation (XWayland) for backward compatibility with applications that aren’t ready to work with Wayland directly.\nStarting with the 2024.2 EAP, however, users can run IntelliJ-based IDEs on Wayland natively by adding:\n-Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit\nto their VM options (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…). This will completely bypass the XWayland compatibility layer and provide all the benefits that Wayland has to offer.\nThis initial support aims to provide the foundational functionality necessary for operating an IDE on Wayland. While we have made significant progress, it’s important to note that there are features still in development and known bugs yet to be fixed.\nX11 or Wayland?\nIt’s not always possible to tell visually whether your IntelliJ-based IDE is running through X11 or natively on Wayland. One way to be sure is by using the About dialog (`Help | About`) to obtain full system information. Just click on the Copy and Close button. Towards the top of the copied text the toolkit’s name will be listed as follows:\nToolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nWLToolkit means that the IDE is talking directly to the Wayland server, while XToolkit – as the name would imply – means that the X11 protocol is used.\nThe same information is also available in idea.log; for example:\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nWhat’s Included\nIt goes without saying that this release includes the essential features that make a graphic user interface functional like showing the UI, typing text, moving the mouse pointer around, etc. Some features are worthy of mention.\nSharp Picture\nThe top complaint about running IntelliJ-based IDEs on modern Wayland desktops was the blurry picture you’d get when you scaled your desktop to a fractional value, not an integer multiple of 100%, e.g. 150% or 215%. While this wasn’t an inherent problem with X11, Wayland addresses fractional scale in a more robust way, and our new graphical subsystem supports any desktop scale, including fractional.\nThis area of Wayland is still under development, with improvements being made both on the protocol side and in implementations (such as KWin, Mutter, etc). We follow this work closely and will make the necessary updates to our graphical subsystem as the situation evolves.\nWSLg\nOn the WSLg side, switching to Wayland will mean no more unsightly window decorations imposed by the X server (something many people complained about), since the X server will no longer be involved in any stage of the operations.\nResponsive UI\nThe current implementation delivers a decent frames-per-second performance, which is mainly visible upon scrolling or resizing, as that’s when the window needs to be updated dozens or even hundreds of times per second. At the same time, when things are quiet and only the cursor is blinking, the graphical subsystem will not drain your battery by refreshing the entire screen at 60 FPS. Wayland allows both high-performance screen updates and slow pace periods to coexist in one application, and our graphical subsystem takes full advantage of that.\nThe work in this area is far from over, and utilization of Vulkan is expected to bring even better performance.\nBetter Multi-Monitor Support\nWayland generally handles window placement so that the application doesn’t have to. This is a paradigm change for many graphical applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs included. Among the positive effects of this change is better handling of popups and other utility windows that should now appear on the correct monitor and not cross the monitor boundary regardless of how complex your setup is. This used to be a somewhat weak point with modern systems that allowed different scales to be specified for each monitor and that used to cause a lot of confusion when running through the XWayland compatibility layer.\nWork in Progress\nDespite the advancements, full parity with X11 features has yet to be achieved. There are several areas listed below that we focus on in the near term.\nInput Methods\nInput methods are essential for developers who work with multiple languages and scripts. They provide a standardized way to enter characters that aren’t readily available on a standard keyboard.\nIn 2024.2 EAPs, no input methods are supported on Wayland. Since there is no working around this limitation, this particular feature is at the very top of our priorities list.\nNote, however, that Wayland already supports languages that don’t quite require the sophistication of input methods.\nNative Window Decorations\nThere are still a few utility windows in IntelliJ-based IDEs that are decorated by the OS, such as, for example, the About dialog or the differences window. For the moment, when running on Wayland those decorations (by which we essentially mean the window’s title bar and its buttons) are painted by the JetBrains Runtime and do not adhere to the desktop’s theme.\nAt a later date, we plan to implement native decoration support, similar to what is available currently with X11. In the meantime, the decorations will follow the overall desktop’s dark/light style, for those desktop environments where such notifications are available.\nDrag And Drop\nIn the 2024.2 release cycle, drag and drop within the IDE or between the IDE and other applications will not be supported on Wayland. In many cases, you’ll be able to just copy and paste as a work-around.\nStability\nAs with any major platform shift, there are bound to be some rough edges. We review and prioritize incoming issues on a daily basis so that the most important issues can be addressed as quickly as possible.\nFeedback\nWe deeply appreciate our users’ patience and enthusiasm. Many have already shared their feedback about IntelliJ-based IDEs on Wayland, and this has been instrumental in delivering a robust preview with many “paper cuts” having already been dealt with.\nYour insights and experiences are invaluable to us. By reporting issues and suggesting improvements, you can directly influence the development journey and help us refine Wayland integration in IntelliJ-based IDEs. We encourage you to create new issues on YouTrack and/or upvote the existing ones.\nGet started with the 2024.2 EAP today and join us in shaping the future of IntelliJ-based IDEs on Wayland!\nStay tuned for more updates and improvements in our upcoming releases.",

We designed the new UI to reduce visual clutter, ensuring easy access to essential features while gradually revealing more advanced functionality as needed. The new UI is clean and modern, providing bigger, easier-to-use controls, a consistent color palette, light and legible icons, increased contrast, and better accents.\n\n\n\n\nWork on the new UI began in 2021. We analyzed the issues with the old UI, carefully worked on solutions, released preview and Beta versions, gathered feedback, and conducted over 10 UX studies.\nThere was a lot of positive feedback from our users:\nThe new IntelliJ UI is so good. Minimalistic, modern, and still powerful, good job @jetbrains!\nWow, @WebStormIDE @jetbrains New UI is AWESOME, it looks very fresh.\nI’ve been using it for a few weeks and I absolutely love it. The tiny interface elements in the old UI really felt out of place in modern desktop environments.\nI’ve been using it for several weeks now with IntelliJ Ultimate, and I absolutely love it. I was afraid it was too minimal when I first started using it (I even went back to the “old look” for a little while), but after a few days, I realized everything I needed was still right where I needed it (and when I needed it), and all I’ve lost is the distractions. Everything works, and the look and feel is fresh, responsive and (ok, I’ll say it) modern.\nOf course, there was also negative feedback, and it greatly helped us make the new UI better – we fixed more than 2,000 bugs and made numerous improvements. For example, we added a compact mode, removed the bright blue Run button from the toolbar, added the ability to easily customize the main toolbar, added an option to enable tool window names, and polished color themes.\nFor more information about the main changes in the new UI, see the documentation. For known issues and future plans, see the Knowledge Base.\nCurrently, 87% of our users have adopted the new UI, despite it not being the default option for existing users.\nHow long will we continue to support the old UI?\nThe classic UI is available as a plugin in JetBrains Marketplace. Starting with the 2024.2 version, you will see a popup with the link to the plugin, or you can find the plugin in Settings | Plugins.\nWe plan to support the plugin for at least one year, which means that we will test and release it with every major IDE release. We will evaluate the new UI adoption rate and feedback, and based on this information, we will decide how long we will continue to support the classic UI.\nUnfortunately, the Classic UI plugin won’t work correctly with Gateway and when running the IDEs remotely.\nResources\nWe published the Int UI Kit and Icons pack for the new UI. Currently, we are updating the UI Guidelines to refer to the new UI.",

It’s available from our website, via the Toolbox App, or as a snap package.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.2 EAP\nZephyr West support\nIn this EAP build, we introduce a new project model supported by CLion – it’s called the West project model. As we previously mentioned in our roadmap for this release, a West project makes it much easier to set up, open, and build a project that uses Zephyr RTOS.\nFor existing projects that have installed Zephyr, West, and the Zephyr SDK, CLion detects Zephyr usage and automatically sets up the project to provide code insight features, such as code competition, code navigation, and others.\nIn addition, the new bundled CLion Integration for Zephyr® Project plugin provides the following features:\nAutomatic creation of a Python interpreter and setting it as the current interpreter if there is a directory with a Python virtual environment next to the .west directory in the Zephyr workspace.\nBuilding a project using the west build command.\nAutomatic creation of a run/debug configuration that flashes the built binary to a board using the west flash command (please note that you may need to install Flash Host Tools, like OpenOCD, to flash your binary).\nDevice tree integration uses the same board that is configured for the project.\nAn optional Change Project Root suggestion to set the project’s root to the root of Zephyr’s workspace. By default, the Project view shows all the project’s source roots, which may sometimes be inconvenient.\n\nTo change the path to the West executable, board name, and build directory, go to Settings/Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Embedded Development | West.\n\nA Zephyr project opened previously as a CMake project can be re-opened as a West project using the Convert to West Project action. And vice-versa, a West project can be converted back to a CMake project with the Convert to CMake Project action.\n\nAdditional options for the west flash command can be set in the settings of the West run/debug configuration.\n\nZephyr support is a work in progress, and we’d like to hear your feedback! Let us know your thoughts by commenting below or in our issue tracker.\nFull line code completion for C++\nPreviously introduced for Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, PHP, Go, and Ruby, full line code completion becomes available for C++ with this build.\n\nThe full line code completion feature suggests entire lines of code using a locally run deep learning model. It works completely locally and doesn’t send any data outside your IDE. Also note that it’s included with your active JetBrains IDE subscription at no additional cost.\n❗️Full line code completion works only with the new ReSharper C++ language engine (also known as CLion Nova). Go to Settings/Preferences | Advanced Settings | CLion | Use the ReSharper C++ language engine (CLion Nova) to enable it.\nTo tweak the feature or download models for languages other than C++, go to Settings/Preferences | Editor | General | Inline Completion.\n\nThe full release notes are available here.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hello everyone!\nThe RubyMine team is constantly striving to provide support for new technologies for Ruby and Rails. One of the most exciting recent additions to Rails is undoubtedly Hotwire, so we’ve prepared an overview of this suite of frameworks and a tutorial on how to use the most important Turbo and Stimulus features in your Rails app with RubyMine. This post covers Turbo; to learn more about Stimulus support, stay tuned for our next blog post.\nHotwire and Turbo\nWhat is Hotwire?\nHotwire simplifies web development by sending HTML instead of JSON over the wire (hence the name: it stands for “HTML over the wire”). This reduces the amount of JavaScript written and sent to the browser and keeps template rendering on the server. Hotwire is made up of several frameworks: Turbo, Stimulus, and Strada. In this post, we’ll take a look at Turbo.\nWhat is Turbo?\nTurbo provides simple ways of delivering live partial updates to the page without having to write any JavaScript at all. It also speeds up all link clicks and form submissions in your app thanks to Turbo Drive. In this tutorial, we’ll focus on splitting the pages into separate contexts that can be updated in real time without reloading the full page. For this, we’ll use the other two core concepts of Turbo: Turbo Streams and Turbo Frames.\nWhat are Turbo Frames?\nTurbo Frames let you decompose the page into independent contexts. If you wrap a part of your Document Object Module (DOM) inside a Turbo Frame, you can update just that frame without having to reload the rest of the page.\nWhat are Turbo Streams?\nTurbo Streams can be used to update parts of the DOM without reloading the entire page. A server can send a Turbo Stream message instead of HTML of the entire page; the message will contain HTML fragments, the target element ID, and the action that will be applied to them (add to the target, remove from the target, update the target, etc.: for a full list, please consult the documentation). Much like Turbo Frames, Turbo Streams let you deliver real-time partial page changes. In some ways, the functionality of Turbo Streams is more robust: they let you change multiple parts of DOM and not just the corresponding frame, as well as perform a variety of updates, such as appending or removing elements.\nThe turbo-rails gem is shipped by default with Rails 7, so you can start using it in your applications right away!\nRubyMine, an IDE for Ruby and Rails developers, provides code insight support for Turbo, such as code completion and navigation, which we encourage you to use as you follow this tutorial.\nTutorial: how to use Turbo in Rails apps with RubyMine\nIn this tutorial, we’ll show you how to use the basic building blocks of Turbo. We’ll use a sample Rails application that allows users to make accounts, create microposts, follow each other, and read the microposts in a feed.\nClone the sample Rails app\nFollow these steps to clone our sample app and get it running:\nStep 1. Check out the sample application as described in Check out a project from a remote host (git clone). In the URL field, insert the following address: https://github.com/JetBrains/sample_rails_app_7th_ed.git\nStep 2. Specify the Ruby interpreter and install gems.\n\n\n\n\nAlice’s feed in the sample app\nHow to use Turbo Frames \nWe can currently delete posts in this sample app. Let’s add editing, too.\nOpen the file _micropost.html.erb and add an “Edit” link next to the “Delete” link in the timestamp.\n<!--_micropost.html.erb-->\n\n<span class=\"timestamp\">\n  Posted <%= time_ago_in_words(micropost.created_at) %> ago.\n  <% if current_user?(micropost.user) %>\n    <%= link_to \"delete\", micropost, data: { \"turbo-method\": :delete,\n                                            turbo_confirm: \"You sure?\" } %>\n    <%= link_to \"edit\", edit_micropost_path(micropost) %>\n  <% end %>\n</span>\n2. Add edit and update methods to the micropost controller (don’t worry – the routes have already been added to routes.rb).\n// micropost_controller.rb\n\ndef edit\n  @micropost = Micropost.find(params[:id])\nend\n\ndef update\n  @micropost = Micropost.find(params[:id])\n  if @micropost.update(micropost_params)\n    redirect_to root_url\n  else\n    render :edit, status: :unprocessable_entity\n  end\nend\nThe edit button will redirect us to the micropost/[id]/edit route, which will want to load the view template. Click on the gutter icon next to def edit to create a template file edit.html.erb.\n\n\n\n\nClick the gutter icon to create a view template next to a controller action\n3. Add the following code to your microposts/edit.html.erb file: \n<!--microposts/edit.html.erb-->\n\n<%= render 'shared/micropost_form'%>\nIn order to edit a post, we simply need to render the existing partial shared/micropost_form which we already use for creating microposts. If we click on edit now, we’ll be redirected to a new page.\n\n\n\n\nThe Edit button takes us to a new page \nBut what we’d like to do here is to have in-place editing: instead of loading a new page, let’s replace the existing micropost body with a form, update the text, save it – and stay on the same page throughout. \nTo do that, we can utilize Turbo Frames. \nWith Turbo Frames, we’ll be able to load the form in place of the micropost, update its content, and then render the updated micropost without having to reload the rest of the page.\n4. Add a turbo_frame_tag view helper to _micropost.html.erb:\n<!--_micropost.html.erb-->\n\n<%= turbo_frame_tag micropost do %>\n  <%= link_to avatar_for(micropost.user, size: 50), micropost.user %>\n  <span class=\"user\"><%= link_to micropost.user.name, micropost.user %>\n</span>\n  <span class=\"content\">\n    <%= micropost.content %>\n    <% if micropost.image.attached? %>\n      <%= image_tag micropost.image.variant(:display) %>\n    <% end %>\n  </span>\n  <span class=\"timestamp\">\n    Posted <%= time_ago_in_words(micropost.created_at) %> ago.\n    <% if current_user?(micropost.user) %>\n      <%= link_to \"delete\", micropost, data: { \"turbo-method\": :delete,\n                                               turbo_confirm: \"You sure?\" } %>\n      <%= link_to \"edit\", edit_micropost_path(micropost) %>\n    <% end %>\n  </span>\n<% end %>\nWe’ll be able to use this frame to specify which parts of HTML should be replaced when the server processes a request. A frame should have a unique ID which is passed as an argument to turbo_frame_tag. It can be a string or a symbol, but in our case, we need it to be unique to make sure we’re working with the right frame, so it needs to depend on the specific record. Luckily, Turbo Frames are very convenient to use: we can just pass the micropost object, and turbo_frame_tag will automatically apply the dom_id helper to it and use that as the frame ID. \nSince we’d like to replace our micropost with a form to edit it, we’ll need edit.html.erb to contain a matching Turbo Frame.\n5. In microposts/edit.html.erb, add the turbo_frame_tag helper:\n<!--microposts/edit.html.erb-->\n\n<%= link_to \"Back\", root_path %>\n<%= turbo_frame_tag @micropost do %>\n  <%= render \"shared/micropost_form\", micropost: @micropost %>\n<% end %>\nPlease note that the frame IDs passed to the turbo_frame_tag helper should match on both pages. \nNow, when we click on the Edit link, the controller responds to the microposts/[id]/edit request with a Turbo Frame. The content of this new Turbo Frame replaces the old content, and we now see a micropost form instead of the micropost content and can edit its text. When we click on Post and send a request to the microposts/[id]/update route, the controller once again sends us a response containing Turbo Frames; Turbo finds the matching frame and uses its contents to replace the existing ones: in this case, the updated micropost. You can check the console to see how Rails processes the requests.\nEdit with Turbo\nAny link or form inside a Turbo Frame will be intercepted and will try to find a Turbo Frame of the same ID as its parent frame or its target (links can target different frames; to do that, add a data: { turbo_frame: [frame id] } as an argument for link_to).\nBut what if you want to update multiple elements on the page with a single click of a link? Or append or remove elements instead of replacing them? This is where Turbo Streams come in handy.\nHow to use Turbo Streams\nTo demonstrate the power of Turbo Streams, we’ll add an unfollow link to each micropost and update the user.following count in real time when the current user unfollows someone from their feed. We’ll also remove all the posts by the unfollowed user.\nOpen _micropost.html.erb and add an unfollow link to each micropost not made by the current user:\n<!--microposts/edit.html.erb-->\n\n<% if current_user?(micropost.user) %>\n  <%= link_to \"delete\", micropost, data: { \"turbo-method\": :delete,\n                                           turbo_confirm: \"You sure?\" } %>\n  <%= link_to \"edit\", edit_micropost_path(micropost) %>\n<% elsif !current_user.nil? && current_user.following?(micropost.user) %>\n  <%= link_to \"unfollow\",\n  relationship_path(current_user.active_relationships.find_by(followed: micropost.user), user_to_update: current_user),\n  data: {turbo_method: :delete, turbo_confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>\n<% end %>\nWhere does the path come from? The current app already implements functionality that allows users to follow and unfollow each other; moreover, this functionality even uses Turbo Streams. To achieve a better understanding of Turbo, we’ll take that implementation up a step and allow users to unfollow other users not just from the user page, but also from their feed.\nThe User model maintains the list of all the users a user follows (active_relationships) and all the users that follow that user (passive_relationship). To unfollow a user, we need to destroy this active_relationships association between the two users; therefore, we need to obtain the correct path and set the link to use the DELETE method (which, thanks to Turbo, we can do out of the box).\nLet’s see what happens when we click on unfollow:\n\n\n\n\nUnfollow: initial implementation\nNot only are the posts of the user we just unfollowed still present on our feed, but the counter update, although live, is also wrong.\nTo fix this, let’s first take a look at the controller that manages relationships.\n2. Open the file relationships_controller.rb.\nThe current code is as follows:\n# relationships_controller.rb\n\n@user = Relationship.find(params[:id]).followed\ncurrent_user.unfollow(@user)\nrespond_to do |format|\n  format.html { redirect_to @user, status: :see_other }\n  format.turbo_stream\nend\nIt is designed for unfollowing users from the Users page of the sample app: as the current user, you unfollow another user and then see their follower count decrease. However, in our case, we’d like to unfollow a user from our feed page and then see the current user’s following count decrease. To do that, we just need to know which user (current or unfollowed user) we’re about to update the counters for.\n3. Open the file routes.rb and add a route with an extra parameter that will let us pass the ID of the user for whom we want to update the counter:\n# routes.rb\n\nresources :relationships, only: [:create, :destroy]\ndelete '/relationships/:id/:user_to_update', to: 'relationships#destroy_with_counter_update\nNow that we’re passing a parameter and using a custom route, we’ll need to update the path we’ll be using for the unfollow link:\n<!--microposts/edit.html.erb-->\n\n<%= link_to \"unfollow\", \"/relationships/#{current_user.active_relationships.find_by(followed: micropost.user).id}/#{current_user.id}/\",\n                data: {turbo_method: :delete, turbo_confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>\nWe can now retrieve the user from the parameters when updating relationships_controller.rb.\n4. Add the following code to relationships_controller.rb:\n# relationships_controller.rb\n\ndef destroy_with_counter_update\n  relationship = Relationship.find(params[:id])\n  @unfollowed_user = relationship.followed\n  current_user.unfollow(@unfollowed_user)\n\n  @user = User.find(params[:user_to_update])\n  @microposts = Micropost.where(:user_id => @unfollowed_user)\n\n  respond_to do |format|\n    format.html { redirect_to @unfollowed_user, status: :see_other }\n    format.turbo_stream\n  end\nend\nThis method handles unfollowing users from the feed and immediately updating the following counters.\nBy this point, you may be wondering what format.turbo_stream is and what this method does.\nTurbo interjects its special turbo_stream format into the Accept header of the request (this is done by default if the form is submitted with a POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE method, but you can manually add this format to your GET requests as well; see the documentation). The controller can then send a response in this format or ignore it and fall back on HTML. This is exactly what’s happening in the code for RelationshipsController#destroy: the controller can send responses in both HTML and Turbo Stream formats.\nformat.turbo_stream can render the response inline in the controller:\nformat.turbo_stream { render turbo_stream: turbo_stream.update \"following\", @user.following.count }\nIf you’d like to update multiple targets, it’s preferable to use the corresponding view template with the extension .turbo_stream.erb.\n5. Create a file named relationships/destroy_with_counter_update.turbo_stream.erb and paste the following code there:\n<%= turbo_stream.update \"followers\" do %>\n  <%= @user.followers.count %>\n<% end %>\n<%= turbo_stream.update \"following\" do %>\n  <%= @user.following.count %>\n<% end %>\n<%= microposts = Micropost.where(:user_id => @unfollowed_user) %>\n<% microposts.each do |post| %>\n  <%= turbo_stream.remove post %>\n<% end %>\nLet’s take a closer look at the code that updates the Following count:\n<%= turbo_stream.update \"following\" do %>\n  <%= @user.following.count %>\n<% end %>\nWhat do these lines do?\nThe controller needs to send some HTML in response to a request. Turbo lets us send fragments of HTML without sending the entire page. In this case, only those fragments are updated, without a full page reload. These lines specify the Turbo Streams message that the controller will send.\nThe HTML for those messages takes on the following form:\n<turbo-stream action=\"[action name]\" target=\"[target element or Turbo Frame ID]\">\n  <template>\n    The contents of this tag will be applied to the target element as per the specified action, e.g. deleted, appended, replaced, etc.\n  </template>\n</turbo-stream>\nTurbo Streams let the users execute eight actions in total: append, prepend, replace, update, remove, before, after, and morph. For more information, please consult the documentation.\nLet’s take a look at the code we added to destroy.turbo_stream.erb again:\n<%= turbo_stream.update \"following\" do %>\n  <%= @user.following.count %>\n<% end %>\nWe want to perform the update action on the following target (you may find the DOM element with this ID in the shared/_stats.html.erb partial), and we want the target to be updated with the @user.following.count HTML.\nNow let’s take a look at the code that removes all the posts by the unfollowed user from the feed:\n<%= microposts = Micropost.where(:user_id => @unfollowed_user) %>\n<% microposts.each do |post| %>\n  <%= turbo_stream.remove post %>\n<% end %>\n\n\n\n\nUnfollow with Turbo Streams\nAs you can see, now we can unfollow users right from the feed. The following count will update correctly and in real time, and the posts will disappear from the feed – all without a full-page reload!\nHow to use broadcasting\nAnother way to achieve this is broadcasting.\nTurbo Streams can be broadcast from models upon updates to the record. There are several basic actions that can be broadcast: remove, replace, append, prepend, before, after, and update. For more information, please consult the documentation.\nIn our case, we’d like to broadcast updates when one user unfollows another – that is, when an instance of Relationship is destroyed.\nFirstly, we’ll need to destroy the record in RelationshipsController#destroy.\nOpen relationships_controller.rb, navigate to the destroy_with_counter_update method, and add the following line:\n#relationships_controller.rb\n\nrelationship.destroy!\nSince broadcasting is done in a model callback, we’ll need to explicitly destroy the record first.\n2. Open the file relationship.rb and add the following line:\n# relationship.rb\n\nafter_destroy { broadcast_update_to \"following_stream_#{follower.id}\", target: \"following\", html: \"#{follower.following.count}\" }\nafter_destroy is the callback that executes after a Relationship record has been destroyed. broadcast_update_to is the method that allows us to broadcast the update action to Turbo Streams. You can broadcast other actions, too:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompletion for broadcast\nLet’s take a look at the arguments to broadcast_update_later_to. First, we have to specify the stream we’ll be broadcasting to. In our case, we’d like the stream name to depend on the user ID to ensure we’re broadcasting the right information to the right users; otherwise, we might, for example, decrease the counter for all the users and not just for the current one. Therefore, let’s name our stream following_stream_#{follower.id}. We also have to specify the target: it’s still the same DOM element with the ID following. Finally, we need to provide the HTML fragment to be rendered. Frequently, it is a partial view, in which case the arguments would look like this:\nafter_destroy { broadcast_update_later_to \"[stream name]\", target: \"[target ID]\", partial: \"[partial name]\", locals: { ... } }\nIn our case, it is enough to pass the HTML.\nIn order to receive broadcasts, we have to subscribe to streams of the corresponding name in the view files.\n3. Open the file shared/_stats.html.erb. After the first line, add the following:\n<!--shared/_stats.html.erb-->\n\n<% @user ||= current_user %>\n\n<%= turbo_stream_from \"following_stream_#{@user.id}\" %>\nAnd don’t forget to remove the code we added to destroy.turbo_stream.erb that updates the following counter, since we’re now updating it via broadcasting instead.\nNow, if we load the page and unfollow a user, we’ll see the counter being updated in real time.\nWhen should we use broadcasting instead of sending Turbo Streams from the controller?\nYou should use broadcasting if: \nThe update should be visible not just to the current user, but to everyone viewing the same page \nThe update is asynchronous\nIf neither of those is required, you can use Turbo Streams from the controller.\nConclusion\nIn this tutorial, we’ve explored the Turbo framework and its core concepts: Turbo Streams and Turbo Frames. We’ve learned to use Turbo Frames and Turbo Streams in our Rails applications to deliver real-time partial updates to the pages.\nTurbo Frames let us deliver partial live updates to certain DOM elements, while Turbo Streams let us target multiple elements and perform a variety of actions. However, sometimes we might want more interactivity than Turbo Streams allow, and thus, we must turn to JavaScript.\nLuckily, Hotwire provides another component to do just that: Stimulus.\nFor more information about Stimulus, please stay tuned for our next blog post.\nTake advantage of Hotwire support in your favorite JetBrains IDE for Ruby and Rails.

Previously, neXDos prototyped, backtested, and future-proofed their trading algorithms by hosting JupyterLab and JupyterHub. But this approach was problematic due to complexity in many areas, including managing the server environment, carrying out frequent updates, and handling the associated plugins within JupyterLab.\n“Hosting JupyterHub on a Kubernetes cluster was a hard task, primarily due to the complexities of managing regular upgrades and installing and maintaining numerous plugins.”\n\n            \nDr. Steffen Möllenhoff\n                                                                Managing Partner at neXDos\n                                    \nFurther complications arose due to security requirements and Germany’s stringent data protection regulations, which necessitated hosting neXDos’ operations on bare metal servers. To maintain compliance, management of user permissions and access rights was critical. This entailed developing custom LDAP authentication scripts – a process that posed complex security risks, especially in granting interns temporary access to certain data.\n“Managing access rights was quite a challenge, especially when it came to temporary permissions for interns. Granting access and later rescinding this access often presented security concerns.”\n\n            \nDr. Steffen Möllenhoff\n                                                                Managing Partner at neXDos\n                                    \nIn the face of these challenges, neXDos required a solution that would fulfill their technical requirements:\nCompatibility with bare metal servers\nCompliance with German data protection requirements\nSimplified user access control, along with easy team collaboration \nEnhanced Workflow with Datalore: Streamlined, Collaborative, and Secure\nneXDos turned to Datalore as it catered to their needs, offering an on-premises installation, built-in SSO authentication, and streamlined collaboration and permission management within Jupyter notebooks.\n“Datalore’s streamlined workflow allowed us to go from strategy prototyping to testing and deployment with ease.” – Dr. Steffen Möllenhoff, Managing Partner\nAdopting Datalore as a data science platform gave neXDos an efficiency boost in the following steps of their workflow:\nFor each new project, the neXDos team would create a new team workspace and grant view and edit permissions to certain team members. The team lead would pre-configure the necessary workspace-wide SQL database connections and environment configurations using init.sh scripts. \nQuantitative analysts would then create a new Datalore notebook to gather all necessary data from stock market APIs and the corporate PostgreSQL database using Python and SQL and prototype a bespoke investment strategy.\nAnalysts would then backtest results and future-proof the strategy by using Datalore’s Scheduled runs feature to run a daily analysis. \nAfter the strategy was proven to be successful out of sample, a Python Engineer would then turn the Jupyter notebook into a Python script and deploy it to perform sell and buy advice orders.  \n\n\n\n\n“Datalore’s coding assistance feature greatly enhanced our productivity. It helped us in quick prototyping and made coding in Python and SQL much easier.” – Henry Eitel, Software Engineer at neXDos\n      \n      See Datalore in Action\n    \n\n\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n    \n“With Datalore, we discovered a reliable platform that provided us with the right balance of collaboration, efficiency, and data security.”\n\n            \nDr. Steffen Möllenhoff\n                                                                Managing Partner at neXDos\n                                    \nImplementing Datalore as their primary data science platform led to improvements in neXDos’ performance and productivity. The process of prototyping, backtesting, and deploying trading strategies became more efficient.\n“Datalore’s collaborative workflows and integrated environment, permission, and data management significantly accelerated our move from prototyping investment strategies to testing and actual deployment.” – Dr. Steffen Möllenhoff, Managing Partner at neXDos\nneXDos also found Datalore’s reliability to be beneficial. With zero incidents of service downtime, neXDos’ operations went uninterrupted, boosting productivity. \n“Datalore’s uninterrupted service and easy upgrades give me peace of mind and one less tool in our stack to think about.” – Henry Eitel, Software Engineer at neXDos\nAnother positive of Datalore is the way its robust permission management features allowed neXDos to incorporate interns into specific projects. \n“Datalore’s robust permission management enabled us to invite interns into our projects while adhering to our strict data security obligations” – Dr. Steffen Möllenhoff, Managing Partner at neXDos\n      \n      See Datalore in Action\n    \n\n\n\n\nAbout neXDos\nneXDos is a Germany-based asset management company primarily focusing on listed equities. With its team of data professionals and industry experts, neXDos utilizes extensive quantitative research and data analysis to help manage clients’ investments efficiently. The company has recently launched its first public investment fund, marking a significant milestone in its journey.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the July edition of Java Annotated Monthly!\nWe’re excited to feature insights from the ever-brilliant Trisha Gee, who’s been busy curating some top-class content over the past month.\nThis edition is packed with Java news and tips, including a spotlight on the upcoming Java 23. You’ll also find articles on Kotlin, Spring, AI, and more. Whether you’re a professional developer or just starting out on your Java journey, there’s something for everyone.\nDon’t forget to check out our list of events happening in July. From conferences to meetups, there are plenty of opportunities to connect and learn with fellow enthusiasts.\nDive in and enjoy!\nFeatured content\nTrisha Gee is a software engineer, Java Champion and author. Trisha has developed Java applications for a range of industries of all sizes, including finance, manufacturing and non-profit, and she’s a lead developer advocate at Gradle. She has expertise in Java high-performance systems and dabbles with Open Source development.\nI’m back! Ahhh, Java Annotated Monthly… It’s like home to me. Don’t get your hopes up though, I’m not Back For Good (yes I will be seeing Take That in concert when they come to my city next month), I’ve just been invited to write a short piece for this month’s annotated monthly. Short? Me? It’s a challenge.\nAt the front of my mind at the moment is developer productivity engineering and testing. While there are sexier and more interesting topics than testing in the developer productivity/platform engineering space, to me, testing and productivity are inextricably linked.\nFirstly, running automated tests is something that can impact our productivity, especially if they take a long time. It’s even worse if the tests fail frequently, slowing us down and forcing us to context switch. And if those tests are flaky? Don’t get me started on flaky tests. You should fix your flaky tests.\nSecondly, the very fact that we have automated tests that can tell us the code we wrote is working the way we expect, and that we haven’t broken anything unexpected, gives us high levels of confidence in the work we’re doing. For me, developer productivity is all about the joy we feel when we write code, particularly when we write the right code. When my test goes green, it gives me a lovely dopamine hit.\nThe things I’ve been reading or watching about developer productivity and testing don’t really count as “news”, as nothing here is particularly new. Some of these pieces are reminders of what we should be thinking about with regards to testing, and some show the evolution of tools and practices that can help us:\nTesting in the Twenties (blog) by Tim Bray.\nKent Beck On Testing (video). Kent has a great discussion with Dave Farley about testing and TDD.\nWe need to talk about testing (blog) by Dan North.\nHolistic Approach to Testing (podcast with transcript) with Lisa Crispin.\nDeveloper Experience and Testing in Production (podcast with transcript) with Kelsey Hightower.\nAll about test automation: best practices (podcast) with Angie Jones. \nDid you know you can run your Maven builds in parallel? For more tips for speeding up Maven builds, check out my colleague Brian Demers’ Maven courses on DPE University.\nThere are also a bunch of talks about different aspects of automated testing in the DevoxxUK conference videos.\nMaybe you’re the sort of developer who isn’t excited about testing – who can blame you? So let’s leave you with my favorite IntelliJ IDEA tip for writing test methods quickly, a great conversation with Dr Nicole Forsgren about how to measure developer productivity, the purpose of metrics from Lisa Crispin which refers to both DORA and SPACE, a related article about why using data from humans to measure productivity is at least as valid as using “real” data from machines, and Dan North’s humorous yet damning response to That Terrible Article About Developer Productivity.

        "contentSnippet": "알리에서 M.2 NVMe enclosure 중에 USB4 40Gbps 제품 중에 ASM2464PD 칩셋을 사용한 제품이 있길래 테스트 해봤다. 기존의 USB4(혹은 썬더볼트3/썬더볼트4) 제품은 썬더볼트인 경우에는 40Gbps로 작동하지만, USB3.x로 연결하면 대개 10Gbps 혹은 5Gbps로 작동한다. 하지만 ASM2464PD 칩셋은 USB 3.2 Gen2x2 20Gbps로도 작동이 되는 특성이 있어서 구매 후 이리저리 테스트 해봤다.\n \n1. Maiwo k1625 제품의 스펙, 특징\nMaiwo K1625는 Asmedia의 ASM2464PD 칩셋을 사용한 것이 특징이다. 기존의 썬더볼트나 USB4는 모두 인텔사의 칩셋을 사용하는데, 2023년에 드디어 asmedia도 USB4 (썬더볼트 호환) 칩셋을 내놓은 것이다.\n보통 NVMe 외장 케이스(enclosuer)의 속도는 USB3 계열로는 5Gbps, 10Gbps, 20Gbps 제품이 있고, 썬더볼트3, 썬더볼트4나 USB4의 40Gbps 제품이 있다. 보통 USB3 계열은 하위 호환이 잘되지만 썬더볼트는 USB와의 하위 호환은 별도의 칩셋으로 해결했었다. 주로 JMicron의 JMS582 칩셋을 추가로 사용했는데, Asmedia의 ASM2464PD 제품은 USB4 40Gbps 및 USB3.2의 20Gbps/10Gbps/5Gbps를 모두 지원하는 특징이 있다. 한 마디로 하나의 칩셋에 USB의 현재 기능을 다 넣었다고 보면 된다.\n참고로 해당 제품의 실제 탐색기의 전송속도는 평균 1.6GB/s 정도 나온다고 보면 된다. 물론 몇 기가바이트 이내로 작은 경우 캐시 효과로 잠깐동안 2GB/s 이상의 속도가 나오기도 한다.\nMAIWO K1625 USB4 SSD Enclosure 40Gbps 20Gbps 10Gbps 5Gbps\n\n\n참고로 USB4는 썬더볼트의 기술을 사용해서 만들었기 때문에 실질적으로는 썬더볼트3/4의 기술이다. 이에 관해서는 일전에 써둔 글이 있으니 이를 참고하기 바란다.\n썬더볼트와 USB4, 전송속도 및 호환성 https://sunyzero.tistory.com/291\n \n2. 구성 및 외관\n제품 박스에는 본품과 약 15cm 정도의 USB4케이블, 써멀패드, 고무패킹이 있다. 본품을 열때는 딱히 툴이 필요없고, 스프링의 힘으로 고정되는 걸쇠가 2가 있는데, 생각보다 짱짱해서 스스로 풀릴 위험은 없다. \nMAIWO K1625\n\n\n내부에는 별것이 없고 보이는 면의 기판은 별다른 것이 없다. 나사를 4개 풀면 들어낼 수 있다.\nMAIWO K1625 and asm2464pd chipset\n\n\n뒷면에는 각종 부속품들이 보이고, 위 그립 상단 왼쪽에 가장 큰 칩셋이 ASM2464PD 칩셋이다. 해당 칩셋을 약간 근접샷으로 찍어보면 정확하게 칩셋 이름이 보인다.\nMAIWO K1625, asm2464pd\n\n\nASM2464PD 칩셋은 위와 같이 생겼다.\n \n3. 속도 측정\n속도 측정은 벤치마크 프로그램과 실제 탐색기의 속도를 비교해봤다. NVMe SSD는 디램리스 제품인 SN550 1TB와 디램탑재된 제품인 SN850X 및 PM9A1으로 테스트해보았다.\n참고로 간혹 잘못 연결되어서 썬더볼트나 USB4가 아닌 USB 3.2로 인식되면 윈도우에서는 경고 메시지로 느린 속도로 연결되었다고 나온다. 혹은 크리스탈디스크인포에 보면 전송 방식이 PCIe 로 표시되면 썬더볼트나 USB4로 인식된 것이고, UASP로 나오면 USB 3.2로 인식된 것이다.\nMaiwo K1625 and SN550 1TB\n\n\n디램리스 제품인 SN550으로는 읽기 2450MB/s, 쓰기 2021MB/s 정도로 trim 후 몇번을 테스트를 해봐도 비슷한 수치가 나온다. \nMaiwo K1625 and SN850x 2TB SSD\n\n\n디램 탑제 제품인 SN850x로는 읽기/쓰기가 3080MB/s, 2811MB/s 정도가 나오는데, 이보다 더큰 차이는 랜덤 4k쪽의 차이가 컸다. 하지만 실사용에서는 큰 차이가 없었다. PM9A1도 SN850x와 속도가 거의 비슷하게 나왔다.\n하지만 벤치마크와 달리 실제 사용시에는 위와 같은 속도는 나오지 않는다. 실제 탐색기에서 20GB 정도크기의 파일을 복사해보면 아래와 같은 속도가 나온다. (원본 파일은 SN850x로 PCIe 4에 장착된 SSD에 있었고, Maiwo k1625에는 PM9A1을 넣고 테스트했다.) 아래 캡쳐했을때는 캡쳐 프로그램이 작동하면서 잠깐 속도가 떨어진 상태이고, 실제로는 평균은 1.5GB/s이고, 최대로는 1.8GB/s 정도로 나왔다.\nMaiwo K1625의 탐색기 실제 복사 속도 (USB4 40Gbps 연결시)\n\n\n \nUSB3.2 Gen2 10Gbps에 연결한 경우 700~800MB/s의 속도밖에 안나온다. 간혹 PC를 다른곳에 연결하면 속도가 떨어지는 경우도 있는데, 이건 윈도11에서 외장 디스크는 캐시를 쓰지 않도록 되어있어서 그렇다. 아래와 같이 캐시를 사용하도록 해주면 해결된다. (장치관리자에서 디스크 드라이브에서 해당 목록을 선택하면 된다.)\n장치관리자 디스크 드라이브의 정책 설정\n\n\n중요한 점은 이와 같이 사용하다가 디스크를 뺄 때는 하드웨어 안전하게 제거를 선택하는 것이 좋다. 아니면 다른 글에서 쓴 것처럼 sync 기능을 사용해서 캐시 버퍼를 디스크에 기록하도록 명령하고 빼면 된다.\n윈10 디스크 rescan, flush(sync) 기능 : 안전 제거 https://sunyzero.tistory.com/275\n \n4. 발열 측정\n기본적으로 썬더볼트 외장 디스크는 발열이 꽤 높다. 평상시에도 섭씨 50도를 넘는다. 크리스탈 디스크 인포로 확인해보면 보통 55도 정도를 유지하고, 열화상 카메라로 찍어봐도 50도 정도로 보인다. 심지어 저 사진은 아무것도 안할 때 찍은 것이다. 실제로 벤치마크나 쓰기를 시작하면 55~58도 정도로 올라간다.\nMAIWO K1625, temperature\n\n\n \nMaiwo K1625의 윗 뚜껑을 따고 내부를 확인해보면 확실히 더 뜨겁다. (아무것도 안하는 idle 상태의 온도다)\nMAIWO K1625, temperature\n\n\n완전히 탈거해서 아랫쪽에 있는 ASM2464PD 칩셋을 보면 컨트롤러의 온도는 80도에 유박한다. 손으로 만지면 그냥 화상을 입을 것이다. 신기한 것은 ASM2464PD 칩셋외에는 온도가 높은 칩셋이 없었다. (아무것도 하지 않는 상태의 온도다)\n\n\n어떤 분은 PCIe의 절전 기능인 ASPM(Active State Power Management)를 켜면 발열이 줄어든다고 했다. 그래서 BIOS에서 해당 기능을 찾아서 켜주고, 윈도우 제어판에서 PCIe 절전 기능을 켰다.\nWin11 - control panel - power option - PCIe link state power management - powersave\n\n\nASPM을 설정하니까 평균적으로 섭씨 3~4도 정도는 떨어졌다. 그럼에도 불구하고 여전히 뜨겁긴 하다. 전원 관리 정책(power management policy)으로 Maiwo k1625의 발열을 획기적으로 낮추는 것은 불가능해 보인다.\n하지만 신기하게도 USB 연결로 작동할 때는 절전 기능이 매우 잘 작동해서 빠르게 열을 낮춘다. 조금이라도 사용하지 않으면 즉시 1W의 전력을 소비하면서 온도가 착해지는 장점이 있었다.\n \n5. 펌웨어 및 장치 상태\nMPtool로 펌웨어 버전을 확인하면 다음과 같이 231005850000 이다. 이 제품의 구입이 올 초였으니까 이후에 구입한 사람은 펌웨어 버전이 더 높을 가능성이 있다.\nasmedia MPtool - Maiwo K1625 asm2464PD firmware\n\n\nHWinfo 툴로 확인해보면 다음과 같이 보인다. 현재 상태는 ASPM을 켜놓아서 L1 entry가 활성화 되어있음을 볼 수 있다.\nMAIWO K1625 , asm2464pd\n\n\n \n6. 총평\n인텔의 썬더볼트 인클로저에 비해서 딱히 강점이라는 것은 없어 보인다. USB3.2 Gen2x2 20Gbps를 지원하는 장점이 있긴 하지만 사장되는 분위기라 사용하는 시스템이 많지 않고, 앞으로 점점 USB4로 옮겨갈 듯 싶다.\n그래도 장점으로는 복사 성능이 10Gbps USB 3.2 제품보다 거의 2배의 수준이라 한 번에 수백기가씩 옮기는 경우에는 확실히 이점이 있다. 하지만 이것도 발열이라는 복병으로 인해서 급격하게 성능이 꺽일 수 있다.\n따라서 가장 큰 약점은 발열이다. 발열이 심해도 너무 심한데, 위에 본 것처럼 컨트롤러 칩셋은 아무것도 안해도 80도 가까운 온도를 보여준다. 한번에 100기가가 넘는 파일을 옮겨보면 더 심하게 온도가 발생해서 외부 온도도 60도를 넘어서 손으로 잡기 힘들 정도였다. 나중에 보니까 Maiwo k1625에 팬이 달린 모델이 나왔는데, 쓰기를 많이 한다면 진짜 팬이 있는 모델을 써야 할 것 같다. 썬더볼트 외장을 구매한다면 팬 달린 제품을 권장하는데, 이게 또 소음이 있을 수 있다는 단점이 있다.\n \n \n레퍼런스\n[1] List of SSD enclosure chipset, https://dancharblog.wordpress.com/2024/01/01/list-of-ssd-enclosure-chipsets-2022/#thundebrolt-5-enclosuresusb4-asm2464pd-ssd-enclosures\n \n \n히스토리\n2024.07.07 초고",

OFF 하는 방법을 소개합니다.\n \n \n다크모드가 모바일에서 편하고 PC에서 불편한 이유\n1. 모바일 기기와 PC 화면의 차이\n모바일 기기는 상대적으로 작은 화면을 가지고 있어서 눈에 주는 피로가 적습니다. 다크모드를 사용할 때 모바일 화면의 빛 반사가 줄어들어 눈의 부담이 감소합니다. 반면, PC 화면은 크고, 사용자가 화면에 더 가까이 앉아 있는 경우가 많아 밝고 어두운 전환이 눈에 더 큰 부담을 줄 수 있습니다.\n \n2. 사용 시간과 환경\n모바일 기기는 짧은 시간 동안 자주 사용하는 경향이 있습니다. 예를 들어, 스마트폰은 잠깐씩 확인하고 다시 주머니나 가방에 넣는 경우가 많습니다. 이로 인해 다크모드가 눈의 피로를 줄여주고 편리하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 반면, PC는 장시간 사용되는 경우가 많아 다크모드가 눈에 피로를 줄 수 있습니다.\n \n3. 주변 조명\n모바일 기기는 주로 다양한 환경에서 사용됩니다. 예를 들어, 침대에서나 어두운 방에서 스마트폰을 사용하는 경우가 많아 다크모드가 특히 유용합니다. 반면, PC는 주로 고정된 위치에서 사용되며, 일반적으로 더 밝은 환경에서 사용됩니다. 이로 인해 다크모드가 눈에 더 큰 부담을 줄 수 있습니다.\n \n4. 콘텐츠의 종류\n모바일에서는 텍스트 기반의 콘텐츠를 주로 소비합니다. 예를 들어, 메시지, 이메일, 뉴스 등을 읽을 때 다크모드가 더 편안하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 그러나 PC에서는 텍스트 외에도 그래픽, 비디오, 복잡한 작업을 많이 하므로 다크모드가 시각적으로 불편할 수 있습니다.\n \n5. 눈의 피로\n모바일 기기는 눈에서 멀리 떨어져 있고, 일반적으로 더 작은 글꼴 크기를 사용하므로 다크모드가 눈의 피로를 줄여주는 데 도움이 됩니다. 반면, PC는 더 큰 화면과 더 큰 글꼴 크기를 사용하므로 밝은 모드가 눈에 더 편안할 수 있습니다.\n \n \nPC 버전 X 다크모드 해제 방법\n1. X에 접속하여 좌측 하단에 있는 '더 보기'를 클릭합니다. ▼\n\n\n \n \n2. '설정 및 개인정보'를 클릭합니다. ▼ \n\n\n \n \n3.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "창업가들의 가장 큰 장점이자, 동시에 가장 큰 단점이 될 수 있는 것 중 하나가 너무 멀리, 그리고 너무 넓게 보는 능력이다.\n너무 멀리 본다는 건, 좋게 말하면 장기적인 비전이 있고, 큰 그림을 그릴 수 있고, 이 그림을 완성하기 위한 계획성이 있다는 것이지만, 나쁘게 말하면 작은 것도 못 하는데 너무 큰 것만 생각하는 공상가/망상가라는 의미다. 이제 막 시작한 창업가가 월 매출 10만 원도 못 하면서 월 매출 100억 원을 하기 위한 구체적인 계획을 세울 때, 어떤 투자자들은 대단한 비저너리라고 좋아하지만, 어떤 투자자들은 꿈만 꾸는 사람이라고 비난한다.\n너무 넓게 본다는 건, 좋게 말하면 한 번에 다양한 분야로 확장해서 큰 시장을 먹을 수 있다는 의미지만, 나쁘게 말하면 하나에도 제대로 집중하지 못하고 일만 벌이는 스타일이라는 의미일 수도 있다. 하나의 기능도 제대로 못 만들고 있는데, 계속 슈퍼 앱을 만들겠다는 창업가들이 대표적인 사례이다.\n이제 시작하는 창업가들이 나한테 지금까지 봤던 회사 중 잘 된 회사들의 공통점을 자주 물어본다. 회사마다 다르고, 창업가마다 다르기 때문에, 딱 하나의 공통점은 없지만, 오랫동안 사업을 하기로 결심한 분들에겐 작은 것들이 차곡차곡 쌓이면, 복리의 힘으로 인해서 나중에 폭발적인 성장이 만들어진다는 걸 믿으라고 한다. 간단하게 말하면, 성공하는 회사들의 공통점은 작은 것들의 힘과 복리의 힘을 믿는다는 점이다. 이걸 믿지 않으면 창업과 사업이라는 외로운 싸움을 오래 할 수가 없다.\n그럼 작은 것엔 어떻게 집중할 수 있을까? 지금 하는 일, 지금 만들고 있는 기능, 지금 쓰고 있는 이메일, 이게 내가 이 세상에서 하는 마지막 일이라고 생각하면 된다. 그러면 여기에 100% 집중하고, 아무리 작은 일이라도 완벽하게 하려고 노력한다. 매사에 이런 자세로 임하면, 결국엔 작은 것들이 완벽하게 만들어지고, 이렇게 완벽하고 작은 것들이 차곡차곡 쌓이다 보면 아주 크고 아주 완벽한 것으로 성장한다. 폭발적으로 성장한다.\n역사상 가장 완벽한 테니스 선수였던 로저 페더러가 얼마 전에 다트머스 대학교 졸업식 축사에서 이런 명언을 했다. “테니스 경기에서 가장 중요한 건 바로 지금 치고 있는 포인트다. 이게 세상에서 가장 중요하다. 이기기 위해서 최선을 다해야 한다. 하지만, 이기든 지든, 이 포인트가 끝났다면, 이젠 잊어버리고 다음 포인트에 집중해야 한다…지금 이 시점에 모든 걸 집중해야 한다.”\n창업가들도 이런 마인드로 사업을 해야 한다. 이 세상에서 가장 어려운 경기는 지금, 현재 내가 하고 있는 경기다. 이 경기에서 가장 어렵고 중요한 건 바로 지금 치고 있는 포인트다. 그다음으로 중요하고 어려운 건 바로 다음 포인트고, 다음 경기다.\n점수를 하나씩 이기다 보면, 게임에 이기고, 세트를 이기고, 시합에 이긴다. 이 순서대로 인생은 흘러가지, 그 반대로 흘러가지 않는다.\n이제 사업을 막 시작한 어떤 창업가가 본인은 몇백억짜리 회사를 만들 계획이었으면 그냥 대기업에 취직했지, 창업하지 않았을 거라고 했다. 처음부터 본인은 유니콘이 목표라고 하면서. 참고로 이 분은 내가 보기엔 아직 30억짜리 회사도 못 만들었다. 위에서 말한 이유로 나는 이런 창업가들이 싫다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 블로그 방문자 중 나이키 주주가 있을지 모르겠지만, 나는 2005년부터 나이키 주식을 소량으로 꾸준히 사고 있다. 주식을 사는 이유가 그 회사에 대한 확신이 있어서 결국 돈을 벌기 위해서지만, 한 편으로는 그냥 나이키라는 회사와 이 회사가 만드는 제품의 팬으로서 회사의 일부를 소유하고 싶은 팬심도 크게 작용하고 있다.\n지난주에 나이키가 분기 실적을 발표했는데, 월가의 예상보다 낮은 실적이기도 했지만, 이보다 장기적으로 훨씬 더 우려되는 내용들이 많아서, 주가가 하루 만에 20% 폭락했다. 찾아보니 2001년 이후로 최악의 단일 주가 폭락이었고, 하루에 한화로 30조 원이 넘는 시가총액이 증발해 버렸다.\n주가 폭락에는 여러 가지 이유가 있었는데, 장기적으로 봤을 때 가장 큰 위협은 나이키가 요새 혁신에 소극적이고, 이에 따라 좋은 제품을 못 만들고 있다는 점이다. 동시에 그동안 죽었다고 생각됐던 뉴밸런스와 아식스 같은 오래된 브랜드가 지속적인 혁신으로 러닝 시장에서 나이키를 앞지르고 있고, Alo, Hoka와 On과 같은 새로운 브랜드가 MZ 세대뿐만 아니라 X 세대의 취향까지 잘 파악해서 나이키의 시장 점유율을 야금야금 먹어 치우고 있다는 게 전문가들의 분석이다. 이 외에도 중국 시장에서의 고전, 오프라인 매장을 버리고 온라인으로만 판매 채널을 집중한 점 등이 나이키 실적 부진의 직, 간접적인 원인이라고 한다.\n나이키 주주로서는 참 안타까운 일이고, 이제 나이키도 서서히 맛이 가고 있는 것 같으니 다른 종목으로 갈아타는 사람들도 상당히 많은 것 같다. 하지만, 거의 20년 동안 나이키의 주식을 보유하면서 이 회사가 위기와 역경에 어떻게 반응하고 대응하는지를 간접적으로 봤던 일인으로서 내 즉각적인 반응은, “time to buy more”였다.\n기업은 생명체와 같이 유기적으로 성장과 하락을 반복한다. 수년 동안 매일 운동하고 건강했던 사람도 조금만 방심하면 몇 달 만에 체중이 수십 킬로 불면서 비만이 될 수 있듯이, 기업 또한 계속 잘하다가 조금만 방심하거나, 몇 가지 중요한 결정을 잘 못 하면 금방 위기가 올 수 있다. 이건 우리가 투자하는 스타트업이나, 나이키와 같은 글로벌 No.1 대기업이나 마찬가지다. 두 기업 간에 큰 차이가 있다면, 스타트업은 한 번 이렇게 하락하면 버틸 수 있는 체력과 자금이 없어서 망할 확률이 높고, 대기업은 다시 재정비해서 반등할 수 있는 기회가 몇 번 더 있다는 것이지만, 여기서 내가 말하고자 하는 건 기업의 실적은 계속 up and down의 연속이라는 점이다.\n나이키는 어떻게 이 위기를 극복할까? 60년의 비즈니스 역사에서 이런 위기가 올 때마다 취했던 전략을 이번에도 똑같이 구사하지 않을까 생각한다. 그건 바로 본질로 돌아가고, 다시 기본기를 탄탄하게 다지는 것이다. 혁신과 좋은 제품으로 창업된 회사인만큼, 다시 한번 시장을 wow 시킬 수 있는 혁신적이고, 질 좋은 제품을 만들 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있다. 누구나 다 사업하다 보면 옆길로 빠질 수 있고, 본질을 잊어버릴 때가 있지만, 중요한 건 그럴 때마다 다시 기본으로 돌아올 수 있다면, 다시 시작할 수 있다. 이건 나이키나 우리가 투자하는 스타트업이나 다 마찬가지다.\n내가 너무너무 좋아해서, 아예 종이로 출력해서 가방에 항상 소지하고 다니는, 나이키의 창업가 필 나이트가 1970년대에 직원들과 공유했던 메모 내용을 여기에 한 번 적어본다. 이런 철학, 정신, 원칙 위에 만들어진 회사는 꼭 리바운드할 것이라고 믿는다:\n1/ Our business is change.\n2/ We’re on offense. All the time.\n3/ Perfect results count, not a perfect process.\nBreak the rules: fight the law.\n4/ This is as much about battle as about business.\n5/ Assume nothing.\nMake sure people keep their promises.\nPush yourselves push other.\nStretch the possible.\n6/ Live off the land.\n7/ Your job isn’t done until the job is done.\n8/ Dangers\nBureaucracy\nPersonal ambition\nEnergy takers vs. energy givers\nKnowing our weaknesses\nDon’t get too many things on the platter\n9/ It won’t be pretty.\n10/ If we do the right things we’ll make money damn near automatic.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "배경\n최근 특정 데이터를 Apache POI를 사용해서 엑셀 파일로 만들어서 유저에게 서빙하는 기능을 개발했었다. 유즈 케이스를 조금 찾아보았는데, Apache POI로 규모가 큰 데이터를 다룰 때 Out of Memory 가 쉽게 발생한다는 사실을 알게 되었다. 다른 중요한 기능도 수행하고 있는 서버인데, 엑셀 파일을 만들다가 Out of Memory가 발생하면 서버 자체가 죽어버리므로, 발생해서는 안되는 문제였다. 따라서 해당 기능을 동시에 요청할 수 있는 최대 수를 제어할 필요가 있었다. 그렇게 Bulkhead 패턴을 공부하게 되었다.\n💭 사실 가장 좋은 방법은 해당 기능을 수행하는 별개의 서비스를 만들어서 물리적으로 장애를 격리하는 방법이겠지만, 실무를 하다보면 항상 일정, 운영비용과 완성도 사이를 저울질하게 되는 것 같다. 나는 별개 서비스를 만드는 것은 오버 엔지니어링이라고 판단하였고, 기존 서비스에 해당 기능을 붙이되 Bulkhead 패턴을 사용해서 요청량을 제어하는 것이 합리적이라고 판단했다.\n💡 POI의 엑셀 파일 접근을 위한 구현체는 HSSF, XSSF, SXSSF 3개가 있는데, 이 중 SXSSF는 스트리밍 방식을 사용하여 메모리를 과도하게 점유하는 문제를 해결한 구현체이다. 실제로 운영에서는 SXSSF를 사용하여, 눈에 띄게 메모리 사용량이 늘지 않았다.\n\nBulkhead Pattern\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    출처: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)\n  \nBulkhead는 한국어로 격벽을 의미한다. 격벽이란 선박의 공간을 여러 구획으로 나누기 위해 사용되는 벽을 의미한다. 선박의 공간을 격벽으로 구획을 나누면, 어느 한 곳에 물이 차더라도 다른 구획은 이에 영향 받지 않기 때문에, 선박은 안전하게 항해할 수 있다.\nBulkhead 패턴은 선박의 격벽으로부터 영감을 얻어 만들어진 패턴으로, 리소스를 격리하여, 일부 컴포넌트에 문제가 발생하더라도, 그것이 시스템 전체로의 장애로 전파되지 않게끔 만들어주는 패턴이다.\n\nwithout bulkhead vs with bulkhead\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    Bulkhead 를 사용하지 않은 케이스와 사용한 케이스\n  \n예를 들어보자. MSA 환경에서 서비스 A, B, C가 존재한다. 서비스 A의 B API 는 서비스 B를 호출해 응답을 만들고, C API 는 서비스 C를 호출해 응답을 만들어낸다고 가정해보자.\n그런데 서비스 B에 장애가 발생하여, 응답을 매우 느리게 주는 상황이라면? 이런 상황에서 서비스 A의 B API 호출이 발생한다면, 서비스 B의 응답을 기다리느라 계속 쓰레드를 점유할 것이고, 장애가 길어짐에 따라 서비스 A의 톰캣 쓰레드 풀이 고갈될 것이다. 그렇다면 C API 는 서비스 B에 의존하지 않지만, 톰캣 쓰레드를 할당 받지 못해 덩달아 장애의 영향을 받게 된다.\n여기에 Bulkhead 패턴을 사용하여, 두 쓰레드 풀을 격리하면 어떻게 될까? 여전히 서비스 B에 의존적인 B API 의 요청을 처리하는 쓰레드 풀은 고갈 상태가 유지되겠지만, 서비스 C에 의존적인 C API 의 요청을 처리하는 쓰레드 풀은 고갈 상태가 아니므로 서비스 B 장애 여부와 무관하게 요청을 잘 처리할 것이다.\n즉, Bulkhead 패턴의 핵심 아이디어는 ‘리소스 격리를 통한 장애 격리’ 이다. 예시에서는 쓰레드 풀을 예로 들었지만, 커넥션 풀과 같은 다른 자원에도 적용해볼 수 있다. 또한 꼭 리소스 풀을 물리적으로 분리하지 않고, 세마포어1 등의 상호배제 메커니즘 등을 사용하여 Bulkhead 를 구현할 수도 있다.\n\n장애 전파 재현 및 Bulkhead 구현\n코틀린 코드로 아주 간단하게 리소스 고갈로 인한 장애 전파를 재현해보고, 이를 격벽으로 나누어 장애 전파를 차단하는 Bulkhead 패턴을 구현해보자.\n\n리소스 고갈로 인한 장애 전파 재현\nfun main() {\n    val tomcatThreadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)\n\n    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n\n    for (i in (1..4)) {\n        tomcatThreadPool.execute { callBService(startTime) }\n    }\n\n    for (i in (1..4)) {\n        tomcatThreadPool.execute { callCService(startTime) }\n    }\n}\n\nfun callBService(callTime: Long) = println(\"* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: ${System.currentTimeMillis() - callTime}ms\")\nfun callCService(callTime: Long) = println(\"* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: ${System.currentTimeMillis() - callTime}ms\")\n\n이해를 돕기 위해 아래와 같이 가정한다.\nmain 함수 = 서비스 A 애플리케이션\ntomcatThreadPool = 서비스 A의 톰캣 쓰레드 풀 (사이즈 4)\ntomcatThreadPool.execute() = 서비스 A로 들어온 HTTP 요청\ncallBService() , callCService() = 서비스 B, C의 API를 호출하는 함수\n위 코드를 실행하면, tomcatThreadPool 의 쓰레드들은 서비스 B를 호출하기 위해 모두 할당된 후, 작업을 잘 마치고 난 뒤 서비스 C를 호출하기 위해 할당될 것이다. 그럼 아래와 같이 정상적으로 작업이 완료될 것이다.\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 1ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 1ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 1ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 1ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 6ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 6ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 6ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 6ms\n\n그런데 서비스 B의 데이터베이스에 장애가 발생해서, 서비스 B가 굉장히 느리게 응답을 하기 시작했다. 이를 아래와 같이 Thread.sleep() 을 사용하여 표현한다.\nfun callBService(callTime: Long) {\n    Thread.sleep(20_000) // 데이터베이스 장애 발생으로, 굉장히 느리게 응답한다고 가정한다.\n    println(\"* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: ${System.currentTimeMillis() - callTime}ms\")\n}\n\n이렇게 서비스 B에 장애가 발생한 상황에서는, 서비스 B를 호출하기 위한 쓰레드를 비정상적으로 오래 점유한다. 그렇게 되면 서비스 C만 필요한 요청이 톰캣 쓰레드를 할당받지 못하고, 아래와 장애가 전파된다.\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20008ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20026ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20027ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20027ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20027ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20008ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20007ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20007ms\n\n서비스 C를 호출하는 함수는 호출 즉시 결과를 반환할 수 있었으나, 서비스 B 호출로 인해 쓰레드 풀이 밀려 정상적으로 쓰레드를 할당받지 못하게 되었고, 그 결과 서비스 C를 호출하는 함수의 응답까지 덩달아 굉장히 느려졌다. 장애가 전파된 것이다. 실제 스프링 애플리케이션이었다면, 타임아웃이 발생하여 아예 응답을 주지 못하고 예외가 발생했을수도 있다.\n\nBulkhead 적용\n그럼 이제 tomcatThreadPool 을 격벽으로 분리해보자. 이를 bulkheadForB 쓰레드 풀과 bulkheadForC 쓰레드 풀을 만들고, 서비스 B와 서비스 C를 호출하는 메소드를 각각의 쓰레드 풀로 격리할 것이다.\nfun main() {\n    val bulkheadForB = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)\n    val bulkheadForC = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4)\n\n    val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()\n\n    for (i in (1..4)) {\n        // 서비스 B를 호출하는 함수는, bulkheadForB 쓰레드 풀에서 실행\n        bulkheadForB.execute { callBService(startTime) }\n    }\n\n    for (i in (1..4)) {\n        // 서비스 C를 호출하는 함수는, bulkheadForC 쓰레드 풀에서 실행\n        bulkheadForC.execute { callCService(startTime) }\n    }\n}\n\n그럼 결과는 아래와 같을 것이다. 서비스 C를 호출하는 메서드는 더이상 서비스 B의 장애에 영향을 받지 않는다.\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 2ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 2ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 2ms\n* 서비스 C 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 2ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20010ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20009ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20008ms\n* 서비스 B 호출 완료 | 소요 시간: 20009ms\n\n\nResilience4j의 Bulkhead\n실제 업무에서는 위와 같이 직접 Bulkhead 를 구현할 필요 없이 라이브러리를 사용하면 간단하게 Bulkhead 를 구현할 수 있다. 나는 이미 팀에서 Resilience4j 를 사용중이었으므로, 이 라이브러리가 제공하는 Bulkhead 기능을 사용하였다.\nResilience4j의 Bulkhead 는 쓰레드 풀 또는 세마포어를 사용하여 동시 호출 수를 제어하며, 이에 따라 특정 작업으로 인해 과도한 리소스를 차지하지 않도록 리소스를 격리할 수 있도록한다.\n공식 가이드는 여기에 접속해서 읽어보면 되고, 이 글에서는 간단히 적용만 해보겠다. 아래와 같이 resilience4j 의존성부터 추가한다.\nimplementation(\"io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-spring-boot2:2.2.0\")\n\n그리고 application.properties 에 아래와 같이 추가한다.\nresilience4j.bulkhead.instances.backendA.maxConcurrentCalls=4\nresilience4j.bulkhead.instances.backendA.maxWaitDuration=0\n\nmaxConcurrentCalls 는 허용할 최대 동시 호출 수, maxWaitDuration 은 최대 동시 호출 수에 도달했을 때 추가 요청이 들어온 경우 얼마나 기다려줄 것인지를 나타낸다. 지금과 같은 설정은 최대 4개의 동시 요청을 허용하며, 5번째 요청부터는 즉시 실패하도록 한다. backendA 는 벌크헤드의 이름이다.\n@RestController\nclass BulkheadController {\n\n    @Bulkhead(name = \"backendA\", type = Bulkhead.Type.SEMAPHORE)\n    @GetMapping(\"/bulkhead\")\n    fun bulkhead(): String {\n        Thread.sleep(10_000)\n        return \"DONE\"\n    }\n}\n\n위와 같이 간단하게 컨트롤러를 작성했다. type 은 Bulkhead.Type.SEMAPHORE 와 Bulkhead.Type.THREADPOOL 두가지가 있으며, 생략하면 기본값은 세마포어이다. 해당 엔트포인트로 4개를 초과한 동시 요청을 넣게 되면, 아래와 같이 BulkheadFullException 이 발생하는 것을 볼 수 있다.\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    BulkheadFullException 발생\n  \nhttps://hudi.blog/race-condition-critical-section-mutual-exclusion/#세마포어-semaphore",

이것은 그저 Clustered Index1에서 데이터가 PK 기준으로 물리적인 정렬이 되어 있어 가장 빠르게 탐색할 수 있는 방법이었기 때문이다.\n\n정렬을 보장해야한다면, Order By를 반드시 명세하자\n물론 데이터 조회 순서에 영향을 주는 모든 요소를 파악하고 동작을 예측해서, 데이터 정렬 순서를 예상해보는게 가능이야 하겠다만… 그런 수고를 들이느니 간단하게 SELECT 쿼리 마지막에 ORDER BY 를 추가하는게 훨씬 더 경제적이다.\nmysql> SELECT * FROM user WHERE age > 25 AND email LIKE '%@test.com' ORDER BY id  LIMIT 10;\n+----+---------------+-----+----------------------------+--------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+\n| id | address       | age | created_at                 | email                    | first_name | last_name | phone_number |\n+----+---------------+-----+----------------------------+--------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+\n|  1 | 802 Main St   |  77 | 2022-10-09 12:32:10.119311 | grace.jones1@test.com    | Grace      | Jones     | 555-8533     |\n|  3 | 592 Birch St  |  53 | 2024-06-17 12:32:10.119348 | john.miller3@test.com    | John       | Miller    | 555-4130     |\n| 10 | 732 Willow St |  54 | 2023-10-27 12:32:10.119395 | john.smith10@test.com    | John       | Smith     | 555-4544     |\n| 14 | 824 Maple St  |  37 | 2021-02-11 12:32:10.119419 | david.smith14@test.com   | David      | Smith     | 555-3876     |\n| 16 | 616 Birch St  |  31 | 2021-02-10 12:32:10.119432 | alice.johnson16@test.com | Alice      | Johnson   | 555-2375     |\n| 17 | 404 Birch St  |  56 | 2021-11-25 12:32:10.119438 | charlie.doe17@test.com   | Charlie    | Doe       | 555-9786     |\n| 19 | 201 Birch St  |  75 | 2023-08-13 12:32:10.119450 | hank.jones19@test.com    | Hank       | Jones     | 555-9836     |\n| 24 | 808 Maple St  |  45 | 2024-05-23 12:32:10.119480 | david.jones24@test.com   | David      | Jones     | 555-7736     |\n| 28 | 274 Main St   |  35 | 2022-05-16 12:32:10.119504 | bob.davis28@test.com     | Bob        | Davis     | 555-4227     |\n| 31 | 640 Cedar St  |  40 | 2019-11-08 12:32:10.119522 | jane.doe31@test.com      | Jane       | Doe       | 555-8499     |\n+----+---------------+-----+----------------------------+--------------------------+------------+-----------+--------------+\n10 rows in set (0.02 sec)\n\nORDER BY 를 추가하고 나서야, (당연하게도) id 기준으로 정렬되어 결과를 보여주는 것을 볼 수 있다.\n\nSQL-92 명세\n사실 SQL의 이런 동작 방식은 SQL-92 이라는 SQL 표준 명세2를 보아도 알 수 있다.\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    SQL-92 내용 발췌\n  \nIf an <order by clause> is not specified, then the ordering of the rows of Q is implementation-dependent.\nSQL-92 문서를 읽어보면 중후반부에 ‘만일 order by 절이 명세되지 않았다면, Q(쿼리)의 정렬은 구현에 의존한다.’ 라는 내용이 명확히 존재하는 것을 알 수 있다.\n따라서 예시를 MySQL로 들었지만, 이런 특징은 비단 MySQL 뿐 아니라 Oracle, SQL Server 와 같은 다른 벤더의 DBMS 도 마찬가지이다3.\n\nDBMS는 굳이 PK 기준 정렬을 해줄 의무가 없다\n그럼 MySQL을 포함한 여러 DBMS 들은 배려심이 없어서 이렇게 개발자를 당황하게 만드는 걸까?\n이건 내 개인적인 생각이지만, 잘 생각해보면 MySQL은 굳이 ORDER BY 가 없는 질의에 대해서 PK 기준으로 정렬을 해줄 의무가 없다. 대부분의 경우 PK를 auto_increment 로 사용하지만, UUID 처럼 sequential 하지 않은 값을 사용하는 경우도 충분히 존재한다. 이런 경우 애써 MySQL이 정렬을 해준다고 한들, 그 순서는 별 의미가 없을 것이다.\n\n흔한 실수: 커서 기반 페이지네이션\n관련하여 나의 실수를 하나 공유해본다. 매일 새벽에 해당 일자에 발생한 어떠한 데이터를 집계하는 배치 잡을 작성하던 때였다. 아무래도 배치이기 때문에 많은 양의 데이터를 다루게 되는데, 이때 다량의 데이터를 제한 없이 모두 읽어오게 되면, OOM이 발생하게 되어 배치 잡 프로세스가 죽을수도 있다.\n따라서 이런 경우 페이지네이션을 사용해야 안전하다. 페이지네이션은 크게 오프셋 기반과 커서 기반 방식으로 나뉘게 되는데, 커서 기반의 페이지네이션 방식이 오프셋 기반 방식에 비해 여러 이점이 있어 (이건 별개 포스팅으로 다뤄보겠다), 커서 기반 페이지네이션을 선택했다.\n커서 기반 페이지네이션은 커서 기준으로 삼을 sequential 한 컬럼이 하나 필요한데, 위 예제와 비슷하게 당시 테이블도 PK인 id 컬럼이 sequential 했으므로 이 컬럼을 기준으로 잡고 로직을 작성했다. 위 예제를 예로 들자면, 아래와 같이 JPA Repository 메소드를 작성한것이다.\ninterface UserRepository : JpaRepository<User, Long> {\n    fun findByIdGreaterThanAndAgeGreaterThanAndEmailEndsWith(\n        id: Long,\n        age: Int,\n        email: String,\n        pageable: Pageable,\n    ): List<User>\n}\n\n그리고 여러분의 예상처럼, 배치는 어떤 데이터는 중복으로 집계되고, 어떤 데이터는 누락되면서 난리가 났고, 나는 새벽 한밤중에 부랴부랴 대응하느라 정신이 없었다. 하필 다음날 오전에 출국하는 비행기가 있었는데, 잠을 늦게 자서 비행기를 놓칠뻔했다.\n그러니까, 커서기반 페이지네이션 할 때 꼭 ORDER BY 를 넣어서 정렬을 보장하자. MySQL은 여기까지 배려해주지 않는다.\n\n참고\nhttps://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/6051/what-is-the-default-order-of-records-for-a-select-statement-in-mysql\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/8746519/sql-what-is-the-default-order-by-of-queries\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/49815703/what-is-the-default-order-by-for-a-mysql-innodb-query-that-omits-the-order-by\nhttps://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt\nhttps://hudi.blog/db-clustered-and-non-clustered-index/\nhttps://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~shadow/sql/sql1992.txt\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/conor_cunningham_msft/no-seatbelt-expecting-order-without-order-by",

'불닭볶음면'으로 북미·유럽에서 선풍적인 인기를 얻고 있는 삼양식품이 1분기에 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}어닝 서프라이즈를 내면서 식료품주들은 최근 한 달 코스피 주가 상승률 상위 종목 대부분을 차지하고 있다.\n한 달간 CJ씨푸드 주가가 120.6% 오른 것을 비롯해 해태제과식품은 72.4%, 빙그레는 46.1% 상승했다. 코스피는 연초 이후 3% 올랐지만 음식료 업종은 24% 상승했다. 사조대림, 사조산업, 사조씨푸드는 지난 14일 동시에 상한가를 기록했다. 냉동김밥이 미국에 수출될 것이란 기대 때문이다.\n식료품주 상한가는 최근 한 달간 드문 일이 아니다. 식료품 업종 내 투자자들이 관심을 갖는 테마가 바뀌면서 여러 종목이 차례로 상한가를 기록하고 있다.\n1분기 어닝 서프라이즈 발표로 5월 17일 삼양식품이 상한가를 기록한 데 이어 지난 10일에는 빨리 찾아온 더위로 빙과류 매출이 늘어날 것이라는 기대에 크라운제과와 해태제과식품이 상한가를 쳤다. 11일엔 막걸리 수출 기대로 국순당이, 13일엔 불닭볶음면 소스를 생산하는 에스앤디가 가격제한폭까지 주가가 치솟았다. 주가가 계속 상승하는 섹터이다 보니 호재성 뉴스가 바로 반영된다.\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}식품주들의 동반 주가 랠리는 수출 모멘텀 영향이 크다. 내수 방어주였던 식품주들이 K컬처와 K푸드 유행으로 '수출 성장주'가 됐다. 국내 음식료 시장 규모가 89조원 수준이라면 글로벌 음식료 시장 규모는 9000조원에 달한다.(중략)\n\n\nK-팝에서 시작된 K-콘텐츠가 글로벌에서 큰 인기를 얻으면서, K-뷰티는 물론 K-푸드까지 열풍을 일으키고 있습니다. 한국국제문화교류진흥원이 발간한 ‘2024 해외한류실태조사’에 따르면, 한류 경험자 중 한국 음식을 이용한 사람의 비율은 75.2%로 11개 콘텐츠 중 가장 높은 것으로 나타났어요.\n한식이 마음에 드는 이유로는 ‘맛이 있어서’(55.4%)가 가장 높고, 다음으로 ‘영화, 드라마 등에서 본 한식 문화를 경험할 수 있어서’(25.3%), ‘가격이 적당해서’(24.1%) 등이 꼽혔습니다. 특히 1위인 맛에 대한 만족감이 2위 응답률보다 2배 격차로 높았고, 대륙별 호감 요인 1위 역시 ‘맛이 있어서’로 조사되었는데요. 단순히 콘텐츠에서 접하고 나서 경험하는 것 이상으로 맛 자체에 대한 호감도가 높아 인기가 많은 것으로 해석할 수 있겠습니다.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}출처: 2024 해외한류실태조사, 한국국제문화교류진흥원 KOFICE\n코스트코, 월마트 같은 미국 주류 유통채널에도 K-푸드 진출이 확대되고 있어요. 이는 K-푸드가 단순히 교민들을 위한 향수의 대상만이 아니라, 세계인들에게 사랑받는 가치있는 상품으로 자리매김했다는 의미입니다.\n앞서 예시로 든 빙그레의 메로나는 달콤하고 시원한 맛으로 전 세계 소비자들의 입맛을 사로잡은 아이스크림이 되었고요. 삼양식품의 불닭볶음면은 핵불닭, 오리지널, 짜장, 크림 까르보 등 여러가지 맛을 출시하며 매운 정도의 레벨을 다양한 맛 시리즈로 풀어내고 있습니다. BBQ 치킨도 프라이드 치킨 이외에 양념, 간장, 마늘 등 세계인들의 입맛에 맞게 다양한 조리법을 개발했고요.\nK-푸드의 해외 시장 진출 확대와 더불어 관련 기업과 ETF에 대한 투자도 활발하게 이루어지고 있습니다. K-식품주 대표로는 빙그레, 삼양식품, CJ제일제당, 농심, 오리온, 오뚜기, 사조산업, 사조대림, 동원F&B 등이 있고요. ETF로는 HANARO Fn K-푸드 ETF, KRX300 필수소비재 지수 ETF 등이 있습니다.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n푸드테크(Food-Tech): 식품(Food)과 기술(Technology)의 합성어. 식품 산업에 정보통신기술(ICT), 인공지능(AI), 빅데이터 등의 기술을 접목하여 혁신적인 서비스나 제품을 개발하는 것을 말해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
