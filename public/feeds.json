This feature allows you to ask questions about your project, and GitHub Copilot will provide you with detailed responses.\n\nAn example use case for the @workspace command in GitHub Copilot is identifying where the ship’s turning logic is handled in the OSS (Open-Source Software) Pioneer project. Without using @workspace, GitHub Copilot would provide general steps on how to identify the ship’s turning logic, such as searching for relevant functions and reviewing code sections related to movement. \n\nWhen you ask, “@workspace, identify where the ship’s turning logic is handled in this project,” it will give specific and actionable insights, directly pointing to the relevant sections of code where the ship’s turning logic is implemented, as showcased in the GIF below. \n\nGitHub Copilot Chat lists the sources it uses to generate responses, providing transparency and helping users verify the information. Additionally, the Content Exclusion feature allows you to customize which files Copilot can access, ensuring sensitive information is never sent to Copilot. This helps enforce company-wide security policies while still benefiting from Copilot’s capabilities across your development workflow. \n\n@workspace is also supported in VS Code. For more information, you can visit the Making Copilot Chat an expert in your workspace page. \nReference Classes and Functions with Copilot Chat \nWhile @workspace is used to dynamically gather workspace context to navigate and understand an entire codebase, references allow you to be super specific about particular classes and functions when you have targeted questions. \nYou can now use GitHub Copilot Chat to reference your classes and functions. This feature allows Copilot to access relevant code segments directly, enabling it to provide answers that directly apply to the code in your project.  \n  \nFor example, in the OSS Pioneer project, you can ask GitHub Copilot, “What are common issues when working with the #StarSystem?” Copilot will then provide pertinent answers based on that specific class. Make sure to add a ‘#’ symbol at the beginning of the name, as demonstrated in this example. \n\nLet us know what you think \nTo access these features, you need the latest version of Visual Studio and an active GitHub Copilot subscription.  \nWe hope you enjoy these new updates to GitHub Copilot.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At Open Compute Project Summit (OCP) 2024, we’re sharing details about our next-generation network fabric for our AI training clusters.\nWe’ve expanded our network hardware portfolio and are contributing two new disaggregated network fabrics and a new NIC to OCP.\nWe look forward to continued collaboration with OCP to open designs for racks, servers, storage boxes, and motherboards to benefit companies of all sizes across the industry.\nAt Meta, we believe that open hardware drives innovation. In today’s world, where more and more data center infrastructure is being devoted to supporting new and emerging AI technologies, open hardware takes on an important role in assisting with disaggregation. By breaking down traditional data center technologies into their core components we can build new systems that are more flexible, scalable, and efficient. \nSince helping found OCP in 2011, we’ve shared our data center and component designs, and open-sourced our network orchestration software to spark new ideas both in our own data centers and across the industry. Those ideas have made Meta’s data centers among the most sustainable and efficient in the world. Now, through OCP, we’re bringing new open advanced network technologies to our data centers, and the wider industry, for advanced AI applications.\nWe’re announcing two new milestones for our data centers: Our next-generation network fabric for AI, and a new portfolio of network hardware that we’ve developed in close partnership with multiple vendors.\nDisaggregated network fabrics offer significant advantages in scalability over modular-chassis fabric switches.\nDSF: Scheduled fabric that is disaggregated and open \nNetwork performance and availability play an important role in extracting the best performance out of our AI training clusters. It’s for that reason that we’ve continued to push for disaggregation in the backend network fabrics for our AI clusters. Over the past year we have developed a Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF) for our next-generation AI clusters to help us develop open, vendor-agnostic systems with interchangeable building blocks from vendors across the industry. DSF-based fabrics allow us to build large, non-blocking fabrics to support high-bandwidth AI clusters.\nDSF extends our disaggregating network systems to our VoQ-based switched systems that are powered by the open OCP-SAI standard and FBOSS, Meta’s own network operating system for controlling network switches. VoQ-based traffic scheduling ensures proactive congestion avoidance in the fabric rather than reactive congestion signaling and reaction.\nThe DSF fabric supports an open and standard Ethernet-based RoCE interface to endpoints and accelerators across several xPUs and NICs, including Meta’s MTIA as well as from several vendors. \nDSF platforms for next-generation AI fabrics \nArista 7700R4 series\nThe DSF platforms, Arista 7700R4 series,  consist of dedicated leaf and spine systems that are combined to create a large, distributed switch. As a distributed system, DSF is designed to support high scale AI clusters.\n\n7700R4C-38PE: DSF Leaf Switch\nDSF Distributed Leaf Switch (Broadcom Jericho3-AI based)\n18 x 800GE (36 x 400GE) OSFP800 host ports\n20 x 800Gbps (40 x 400Gbps) fabric ports\n14.4Tbps of wirespeed performance with 16GB of buffers\n\n7720R4-128PE: DSF Spine Switch\nDSF Distributed Spine Switch (Broadcom Ramon3 based)\nAccelerated compute optimized pipeline\n128 x 800Gbps (256 x 400Gbps) fabric ports\n102.4Tbps of wirespeed performance\n51T switches for  next-generation 400G/800G fabrics\nMinipack3 (Broadcom Tomahawk5 based, designed by Meta and manufactured by Celestica) 51.2T switch.\nMeta will deploy two next-generation 400G fabric switches, the Minipack3 (the latest version of Minipack, Meta’s own fabric network switch) and the Cisco 8501, both of which are also backward compatible with previous 200G and 400G switches and will support upgrades to 400G and 800G.\nThe Minipack3 utilizes Broadcom’s latest Tomahawk5 ASIC while the Cisco 8501 is based on Cisco’s Silicon One G200 ASIC. These high-performance switches transmit up to 51.2 Tbps with 64x OSFP ports, and the design is optimized without the need of retimers to achieve maximum power efficiency. They also have significantly reduced power per bit compared with predecessor models.\nMeta will run both the Minipack3 and Cisco 8501 on FBOSS.\nCisco 8501 (Cisco Silicon One G200 based, designed and manufactured by Cisco) 51.2T switch.\nOptics: 2x400G FR4 optics for 400G/800G optical interconnection \n \n\nMeta’s data center fabrics have evolved from 200 Gbps/400 Gbps to 400 Gbps/800 Gbps and we’ve already deployed 2x400G optics in our data centers.\nEvolving FBOSS and SAI for DSF\n\nWe continue to embrace OCP-SAI to onboard the new network fabrics, switch hardware platforms, and optical transceivers to FBOSS. We have collaborated with vendors, and the OCP community, to evolve SAI. It now supports new features and concepts like DSF and other enhanced routing schemes.\nDevelopers and engineers from all over the world can work with this open hardware and contribute their own software that they, in turn, can use themselves and share with the wider industry.\nFBNIC: A multi-host foundational NIC designed by Meta\n\nWe are continuing to design more ASICs, including the ASIC for FBNIC. FBNIC is a true multi-host foundational NIC and contains the first of our Meta-designed network ASICs for our server fleet and MTIA solutions. It can support up to four hosts with complete datapath isolation for each host.The FBNIC driver has been upstreamed (available from v6.11 kernel). The NIC module was designed by Marvell and has been contributed to OCP.\nFBNIC’s key features include:\nNetwork interfaces for up to 4×100/4×50/4×25 GE with SerDes support for up to 56G PAM4 per lane.\nUp to 4 independent PCIe Gen5 slices\nHW offloads including LSO, Checksum\nLine rate timestamping (for each host all the way from PHY) for PTP\nHeader-Data split to assist Zero-Copy\nCompliant with OCP NIC 3.0, version 1.2.0, design specification\nThe future is open\nAdvancing AI means building data center infrastructure that goes beyond scale. It also has to allow for flexibility and perform efficiently and sustainably. At Meta, we envision a future of AI hardware systems that are not only scalable, but also open and collaborative.\nWe encourage anyone who wants to help advance the future of networking hardware for AI to engage with OCP and Meta to help share the future of AI infrastructure. \nThe post OCP Summit 2024: The open future of networking hardware for AI appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the Open Compute Project (OCP) Global Summit 2024, we’re showcasing our latest open AI hardware designs with the OCP community.\nThese innovations include a new AI platform, cutting-edge open rack designs, and advanced network fabrics and components. \nBy sharing our designs, we hope to inspire collaboration and foster innovation. If you’re passionate about building the future of AI, we invite you to engage with us and OCP to help shape the next generation of open hardware for AI.\nAI has been at the core of the experiences Meta has been delivering to people and businesses for years, including AI modeling innovations to optimize and improve on features like Feed and our ads system. As we develop and release new, advanced AI models, we are also driven to advance our infrastructure to support our new and emerging AI workloads.\nFor example, Llama 3.1 405B, Meta’s largest model, is a dense transformer with 405B parameters and a context window of up to 128k tokens. To train a large language model (LLM) of this magnitude, with over 15 trillion tokens, we had to make substantial optimizations to our entire training stack. This effort pushed our infrastructure to operate across more than 16,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs, making Llama 3.1 405B the first model in the Llama series to be trained at such a massive scale. \nPrior to Llama, our largest AI jobs ran on 128 NVIDIA A100 GPUs. ​But things have rapidly accelerated. ​Over the course of 2023, we rapidly scaled up our training clusters from 1K, 2K, 4K, to eventually 16K GPUs to support our AI workloads. Today, we’re training our models on two 24K-GPU clusters.\nWe don’t expect this upward trajectory for AI clusters to slow down any time soon. In fact, we expect the amount of compute needed for AI training will grow significantly from where we are today.\nBuilding AI clusters requires more than just GPUs. Networking and bandwidth play an important role in ensuring the clusters’ performance. Our systems consist of a tightly integrated HPC compute system and an isolated high-bandwidth compute network that connects all our GPUs and domain-specific accelerators. This design is necessary to meet our injection needs and address the challenges posed by our need for bisection bandwidth.\nIn the next few years, we anticipate greater injection bandwidth on the order of a terabyte per second, per accelerator, with equal normalized bisection bandwidth. This represents a growth of more than an order of magnitude compared to today’s networks!\nTo support this growth, we need a high-performance, multi-tier, non-blocking network fabric that can utilize modern congestion control to behave predictably under heavy load. This will enable us to fully leverage the power of our AI clusters and ensure they continue to perform optimally as we push the boundaries of what is possible with AI.\nScaling AI at this speed requires open hardware solutions. Developing new architectures, network fabrics, and system designs is the most efficient and impactful when we can build it on principles of openness. By investing in open hardware, we unlock AI’s full potential and propel ongoing innovation in the field.\nIntroducing Catalina: Open Architecture for AI Infra\nCatalina front view (left) and rear view (right).\nToday, we announced the upcoming release of Catalina, our new high-powered rack designed for AI workloads, to the OCP community. Catalina is based on the NVIDIA Blackwell platform full rack-scale solution, with a focus on modularity and flexibility. It is built to support the latest NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip, ensuring it meets the growing demands of modern AI infrastructure. \nThe growing power demands of GPUs means open rack solutions need to support higher power capability. With Catalina we’re introducing the Orv3, a high-power rack (HPR) capable of supporting up to 140kW.\nThe full solution is liquid cooled and consists of a power shelf that supports a compute tray, switch tray, the Orv3 HPR, the Wedge 400 fabric switch, a management switch, battery backup unit, and a rack management controller.\nWe aim for Catalina’s modular design to empower others to customize the rack to meet their specific AI workloads while leveraging both existing and emerging industry standards.\nThe Grand Teton Platform now supports AMD accelerators\n\nIn 2022, we announced Grand Teton, our next-generation AI platform (the follow-up to our Zion-EX platform). Grand Teton is designed with compute capacity to support the demands of memory-bandwidth-bound workloads, such as Meta’s deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs), as well as compute-bound workloads like content understanding.\nNow, we have expanded the Grand Teton platform to support the AMD Instinct MI300X and will be contributing this new version to OCP. Like its predecessors, this new version of Grand Teton features a single monolithic system design with fully integrated power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces. This high level of integration simplifies system deployment, enabling rapid scaling with increased reliability for large-scale AI inference workloads.\nIn addition to supporting a range of accelerator designs, now including the AMD Instinct MI300x, Grand Teton offers significantly greater compute capacity, allowing faster convergence on a larger set of weights. This is complemented by expanded memory to store and run larger models locally, along with increased network bandwidth to scale up training cluster sizes efficiently.\n​Open Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric \n\nDeveloping open, vendor-agnostic networking backend is going to play an important role going forward as we continue to push the performance of our AI training clusters. Disaggregating our network allows us to work with vendors from across the industry to design systems that are innovative as well as scalable, flexible, and efficient.\nOur new Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF) for our next-generation AI clusters offers several advantages over our existing switches. By opening up our network fabric we can overcome limitations in scale, component supply options, and power density. DSF is powered by the open OCP-SAI standard and FBOSS, Meta’s own network operating system for controlling network switches. It also supports an open and standard Ethernet-based RoCE interface to endpoints and accelerators across several GPUS and NICS from several different vendors, including our partners at NVIDIA, Broadcom, and AMD.\nIn addition to DSF, we have also developed and built new 51T fabric switches based on Broadcom and Cisco ASICs. Finally, we are sharing our new FBNIC, a new NIC module that contains our first Meta-design network ASIC. In order to meet the growing needs of our AI \nMeta and Microsoft: Driving Open Innovation Together\nMeta and Microsoft have a long-standing partnership within OCP, beginning with the development of the Switch Abstraction Interface (SAI) for data centers in 2018. Over the years together, we’ve contributed to key initiatives such as the Open Accelerator Module (OAM) standard and SSD standardization, showcasing our shared commitment to advancing open innovation.\nOur current collaboration focuses on Mount Diablo, a new disaggregated power rack. It’s a cutting-edge solution featuring a scalable 400 VDC unit that enhances efficiency and scalability. This innovative design allows more AI accelerators per IT rack, significantly advancing AI infrastructure. We’re excited to continue our collaboration through this contribution.\nThe open future of AI infra\nMeta is committed to open source AI. We believe that open source will put the benefits and opportunities of AI into the hands of people all over the word. \nAI won’t realize its full potential without collaboration. We need open software frameworks to drive model innovation, ensure portability, and promote transparency in AI development. We must also prioritize open and standardized models so we can leverage collective expertise, make AI more accessible, and work towards minimizing biases in our systems.​\nJust as important, we also need open AI hardware systems. These systems are necessary for delivering the kind of high-performance, cost-effective, and adaptable infrastructure necessary for AI advancement.​\nWe encourage anyone who wants to help advance the future of AI hardware systems to engage with the OCP community. By addressing AI’s infrastructure needs together, we can unlock the true promise of open AI for everyone.​\nThe post Meta’s open AI hardware vision appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By: Hechao Li and Marcelo Mayworm\nWith special thanks to our stunning colleagues Amer Ather, Itay Dafna, Luca Pozzi, Matheus Leão, and Ye Ji.\nOverview\nAt Netflix, the Analytics and Developer Experience organization, part of the Data Platform, offers a product called Workbench. Workbench is a remote development workspace based on Titus that allows data practitioners to work with big data and machine learning use cases at scale. A common use case for Workbench is running JupyterLab Notebooks.\nRecently, several users reported that their JupyterLab UI becomes slow and unresponsive when running certain notebooks. This document details the intriguing process of debugging this issue, all the way from the UI down to the Linux kernel.\nSymptom\nMachine Learning engineer Luca Pozzi reported to our Data Platform team that their JupyterLab UI on their workbench becomes slow and unresponsive when running some of their Notebooks. Restarting the ipykernel process, which runs the Notebook, might temporarily alleviate the problem, but the frustration persists as more notebooks are run.\nQuantify the Slowness\nWhile we observed the issue firsthand, the term “UI being slow” is subjective and difficult to measure. To investigate this issue, we needed a quantitative analysis of the slowness.\nItay Dafna devised an effective and simple method to quantify the UI slowness. Specifically, we opened a terminal via JupyterLab and held down a key (e.g., “j”) for 15 seconds while running the user’s notebook. The input to stdin is sent to the backend (i.e., JupyterLab) via a WebSocket, and the output to stdout is sent back from the backend and displayed on the UI. We then exported the .har file recording all communications from the browser and loaded it into a Notebook for analysis.\n\nUsing this approach, we observed latencies ranging from 1 to 10 seconds, averaging 7.4 seconds.\n\nBlame The Notebook\nNow that we have an objective metric for the slowness, let’s officially start our investigation. If you have read the symptom carefully, you must have noticed that the slowness only occurs when the user runs certain notebooks but not others.\nTherefore, the first step is scrutinizing the specific Notebook experiencing the issue. Why does the UI always slow down after running this particular Notebook? Naturally, you would think that there must be something wrong with the code running in it.\nUpon closely examining the user’s Notebook, we noticed a library called pystan , which provides Python bindings to a native C++ library called stan, looked suspicious. Specifically, pystan uses asyncio. However, because there is already an existing asyncio event loop running in the Notebook process and asyncio cannot be nested by design, in order for pystan to work, the authors of pystan recommend injecting pystan into the existing event loop by using a package called nest_asyncio, a library that became unmaintained because the author unfortunately passed away.\nGiven this seemingly hacky usage, we naturally suspected that the events injected by pystan into the event loop were blocking the handling of the WebSocket messages used to communicate with the JupyterLab UI. This reasoning sounds very plausible. However, the user claimed that there were cases when a Notebook not using pystan runs, the UI also became slow.\nMoreover, after several rounds of discussion with ChatGPT, we learned more about the architecture and realized that, in theory, the usage of pystan and nest_asyncio should not cause the slowness in handling the UI WebSocket for the following reasons:\nEven though pystan uses nest_asyncio to inject itself into the main event loop, the Notebook runs on a child process (i.e., the ipykernel process) of the jupyter-lab server process, which means the main event loop being injected by pystan is that of the ipykernel process, not the jupyter-server process. Therefore, even if pystan blocks the event loop, it shouldn’t impact the jupyter-lab main event loop that is used for UI websocket communication. See the diagram below:\n\nIn other words, pystan events are injected to the event loop B in this diagram instead of event loop A. So, it shouldn’t block the UI WebSocket events.\nYou might also think that because event loop A handles both the WebSocket events from the UI and the ZeroMQ socket events from the ipykernel process, a high volume of ZeroMQ events generated by the notebook could block the WebSocket. However, when we captured packets on the ZeroMQ socket while reproducing the issue, we didn’t observe heavy traffic on this socket that could cause such blocking.\nA stronger piece of evidence to rule out pystan was that we were ultimately able to reproduce the issue even without it, which I’ll dive into later.\nBlame Noisy Neighbors\nThe Workbench instance runs as a Titus container. To efficiently utilize our compute resources, Titus employs a CPU oversubscription feature, meaning the combined virtual CPUs allocated to containers exceed the number of available physical CPUs on a Titus agent. If a container is unfortunate enough to be scheduled alongside other “noisy” containers — those that consume a lot of CPU resources — it could suffer from CPU deficiency.\nHowever, after examining the CPU utilization of neighboring containers on the same Titus agent as the Workbench instance, as well as the overall CPU utilization of the Titus agent, we quickly ruled out this hypothesis. Using the top command on the Workbench, we observed that when running the Notebook, the Workbench instance uses only 4 out of the 64 CPUs allocated to it. Simply put, this workload is not CPU-bound.\n\nBlame The Network\nThe next theory was that the network between the web browser UI (on the laptop) and the JupyterLab server was slow. To investigate, we captured all the packets between the laptop and the server while running the Notebook and continuously pressing ‘j’ in the terminal.\nWhen the UI experienced delays, we observed a 5-second pause in packet transmission from server port 8888 to the laptop. Meanwhile, traffic from other ports, such as port 22 for SSH, remained unaffected. This led us to conclude that the pause was caused by the application running on port 8888 (i.e., the JupyterLab process) rather than the network.\n\nThe Minimal Reproduction\nAs previously mentioned, another strong piece of evidence proving the innocence of pystan was that we could reproduce the issue without it. By gradually stripping down the “bad” Notebook, we eventually arrived at a minimal snippet of code that reproduces the issue without any third-party dependencies or complex logic:\nimport time\nimport os\nfrom multiprocessing import Process\nN = os.cpu_count()\ndef launch_worker(worker_id):\n  time.sleep(60)\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  with open('/root/2GB_file', 'r') as file:\n    data = file.read()\n    processes = []\n    for i in range(N):\n      p = Process(target=launch_worker, args=(i,))\n      processes.append(p)\n      p.start()\n     for p in processes:\n      p.join()\nThe code does only two things:\n\nRead a 2GB file into memory (the Workbench instance has 480G memory in total so this memory usage is almost negligible).\nStart N processes where N is the number of CPUs. The N processes do nothing but sleep.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is the most silly piece of code I’ve ever written. It is neither CPU bound nor memory bound. Yet it can cause the JupyterLab UI to stall for as many as 10 seconds!\nQuestions\nThere are a couple of interesting observations that raise several questions:\n\nWe noticed that both steps are required in order to reproduce the issue. If you don’t read the 2GB file (that is not even used!), the issue is not reproducible. Why using 2GB out of 480GB memory could impact the performance?\nWhen the UI delay occurs, the jupyter-lab process CPU utilization spikes to 100%, hinting at contention on the single-threaded event loop in this process (event loop A in the diagram before). What does the jupyter-lab process need the CPU for, given that it is not the process that runs the Notebook?\nThe code runs in a Notebook, which means it runs in the ipykernel process, that is a child process of the jupyter-lab process. How can anything that happens in a child process cause the parent process to have CPU contention?\nThe workbench has 64CPUs. But when we printed os.cpu_count(), the output was 96. That means the code starts more processes than the number of CPUs. Why is that?\n\nLet’s answer the last question first. In fact, if you run lscpu and nproc commands inside a Titus container, you will also see different results — the former gives you 96, which is the number of physical CPUs on the Titus agent, whereas the latter gives you 64, which is the number of virtual CPUs allocated to the container. This discrepancy is due to the lack of a “CPU namespace” in the Linux kernel, causing the number of physical CPUs to be leaked to the container when calling certain functions to get the CPU count. The assumption here is that Python os.cpu_count() uses the same function as the lscpu command, causing it to get the CPU count of the host instead of the container. Python 3.13 has a new call that can be used to get the accurate CPU count, but it’s not GA’ed yet.\nIt will be proven later that this inaccurate number of CPUs can be a contributing factor to the slowness.\nMore Clues\nNext, we used py-spy to do a profiling of the jupyter-lab process. Note that we profiled the parent jupyter-lab process, not the ipykernel child process that runs the reproduction code. The profiling result is as follows:\n\nAs one can see, a lot of CPU time (89%!!) is spent on a function called __parse_smaps_rollup. In comparison, the terminal handler used only 0.47% CPU time. From the stack trace, we see that this function is inside the event loop A, so it can definitely cause the UI WebSocket events to be delayed.\nThe stack trace also shows that this function is ultimately called by a function used by a Jupyter lab extension called jupyter_resource_usage. We then disabled this extension and restarted the jupyter-lab process. As you may have guessed, we could no longer reproduce the slowness!\nBut our puzzle is not solved yet. Why does this extension cause the UI to slow down? Let’s keep digging.\nRoot Cause Analysis\nFrom the name of the extension and the names of the other functions it calls, we can infer that this extension is used to get resources such as CPU and memory usage information. Examining the code, we see that this function call stack is triggered when an API endpoint /metrics/v1 is called from the UI. The UI apparently calls this function periodically, according to the network traffic tab in Chrome’s Developer Tools.\nNow let’s look at the implementation starting from the call get(jupter_resource_usage/api.py:42) . The full code is here and the key lines are shown below:\ncur_process = psutil.Process()\nall_processes = [cur_process] + cur_process.children(recursive=True)\nfor p in all_processes:\n  info = p.memory_full_info()\nBasically, it gets all children processes of the jupyter-lab process recursively, including both the ipykernel Notebook process and all processes created by the Notebook. Obviously, the cost of this function is linear to the number of all children processes. In the reproduction code, we create 96 processes. So here we will have at least 96 (sleep processes) + 1 (ipykernel process) + 1 (jupyter-lab process) = 98 processes when it should actually be 64 (allocated CPUs) + 1 (ipykernel process) + 1 (jupyter-lab process) = 66 processes, because the number of CPUs allocated to the container is, in fact, 64.\n\nThis is truly ironic. The more CPUs we have, the slower we are!\nAt this point, we have answered one question: Why does starting many grandchildren processes in the child process cause the parent process to be slow? Because the parent process runs a function that’s linear to the number all children process recursively.\nHowever, this solves only half of the puzzle. If you remember the previous analysis, starting many child processes ALONE doesn’t reproduce the issue. If we don’t read the 2GB file, even if we create 2x more processes, we can’t reproduce the slowness.\nSo now we must answer the next question: Why does reading a 2GB file in the child process affect the parent process performance, especially when the workbench has as much as 480GB memory in total?\nTo answer this question, let’s look closely at the function __parse_smaps_rollup. As the name implies, this function parses the file /proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup.\ndef _parse_smaps_rollup(self):\n  uss = pss = swap = 0\n  with open_binary(\"{}/{}/smaps_rollup\".format(self._procfs_path, self.pid)) as f:\n  for line in f:\n    if line.startswith(b”Private_”):\n    # Private_Clean, Private_Dirty, Private_Hugetlb\n      s uss += int(line.split()[1]) * 1024\n    elif line.startswith(b”Pss:”):\n      pss = int(line.split()[1]) * 1024\n    elif line.startswith(b”Swap:”):\n      swap = int(line.split()[1]) * 1024\nreturn (uss, pss, swap)\nNaturally, you might think that when memory usage increases, this file becomes larger in size, causing the function to take longer to parse. Unfortunately, this is not the answer because:\n\nFirst, the number of lines in this file is constant for all processes.\nSecond, this is a special file in the /proc filesystem, which should be seen as a kernel interface instead of a regular file on disk. In other words, I/O operations of this file are handled by the kernel rather than disk.\n\nThis file was introduced in this commit in 2017, with the purpose of improving the performance of user programs that determine aggregate memory statistics. Let’s first focus on the handler of open syscall on this /proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup.\n\nFollowing through the single_open function, we will find that it uses the function show_smaps_rollup for the show operation, which can translate to the read system call on the file. Next, we look at the show_smaps_rollup implementation. You will notice a do-while loop that is linear to the virtual memory area.\nstatic int show_smaps_rollup(struct seq_file *m, void *v) {\n  …\n  vma_start = vma->vm_start;\n  do {\n    smap_gather_stats(vma, &mss, 0);\n    last_vma_end = vma->vm_end;\n    …\n  } for_each_vma(vmi, vma);\n  …\n}\nThis perfectly explains why the function gets slower when a 2GB file is read into memory. Because the handler of reading the smaps_rollup file now takes longer to run the while loop. Basically, even though smaps_rollup already improved the performance of getting memory information compared to the old method of parsing the /proc/<pid>/smaps file, it is still linear to the virtual memory used.\nMore Quantitative Analysis\nEven though at this point the puzzle is solved, let’s conduct a more quantitative analysis. How much is the time difference when reading the smaps_rollup file with small versus large virtual memory utilization? Let’s write some simple benchmark code like below:\nimport os\ndef read_smaps_rollup(pid):\n  with open(\"/proc/{}/smaps_rollup\".format(pid), \"rb\") as f:\n    for line in f:\n      pass\nif __name__ == “__main__”:\n  pid = os.getpid()\n  \n  read_smaps_rollup(pid)\n  with open(“/root/2G_file”, “rb”) as f:\n    data = f.read()\n  read_smaps_rollup(pid)\nThis program performs the following steps:\n\nReads the smaps_rollup file of the current process.\nReads a 2GB file into memory.\nRepeats step 1.\n\nWe then use strace to find the accurate time of reading the smaps_rollup file.\n$ sudo strace -T -e trace=openat,read python3 benchmark.py 2>&1 | grep “smaps_rollup” -A 1\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, “/proc/3107492/smaps_rollup”, O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3 <0.000023>\nread(3, “560b42ed4000–7ffdadcef000 — -p 0”…, 1024) = 670 <0.000259>\n...\nopenat(AT_FDCWD, “/proc/3107492/smaps_rollup”, O_RDONLY|O_CLOEXEC) = 3 <0.000029>\nread(3, “560b42ed4000–7ffdadcef000 — -p 0”…, 1024) = 670 <0.027698>\nAs you can see, both times, the read syscall returned 670, meaning the file size remained the same at 670 bytes. However, the time it took the second time (i.e., 0.027698 seconds) is 100x the time it took the first time (i.e., 0.000259 seconds)! This means that if there are 98 processes, the time spent on reading this file alone will be 98 * 0.027698 = 2.7 seconds! Such a delay can significantly affect the UI experience.\nSolution\nThis extension is used to display the CPU and memory usage of the notebook process on the bar at the bottom of the Notebook:\n\nWe confirmed with the user that disabling the jupyter-resource-usage extension meets their requirements for UI responsiveness, and that this extension is not critical to their use case. Therefore, we provided a way for them to disable the extension.\nSummary\nThis was such a challenging issue that required debugging from the UI all the way down to the Linux kernel. It is fascinating that the problem is linear to both the number of CPUs and the virtual memory size — two dimensions that are generally viewed separately.\nOverall, we hope you enjoyed the irony of:\n\nThe extension used to monitor CPU usage causing CPU contention.\nAn interesting case where the more CPUs you have, the slower you get!\n\nIf you’re excited by tackling such technical challenges and have the opportunity to solve complex technical challenges and drive innovation, consider joining our Data Platform teams.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As developers, we spend more time maintaining existing code than we do writing new code. Any tools that can help make this easier can save us a lot of time.\nIn this blog post series, we’ll look at several ways that code analysis in IntelliJ IDEA can help you find and fix problems in your code. In the previous post, we looked at how the IDE can help you prevent problems while working with code. \nPart 1: Introduction to code analysis in IntelliJ IDEA\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA can also help you resolve problems throughout your entire project, not only in the file you’re currently working on.\nFind and fix a specific problem throughout your project\nTo check if a particular problem is present elsewhere in your project, you can run a specific inspection on your whole project or a section of the project. To do so, open the Run Inspection by Name dialog using the shortcut (⌘⌥⇧I on macOS / Alt+\\ on Windows/Linux). Or, find any action in IntelliJ IDEA using Find Action (⌘⇧A on macOS / Ctrl+Shift+A on Windows/Linux) and search for “Run Inspection by Name” in the popup field.\nRun Inspection by Name\n\n\n\nIn the Enter inspection name dialog that opens, enter the name of the inspection you want to run. For example, you may want to replace all `var`s in your code base with explicit types using the Variable type can be explicit inspection. Or, if you prefer the opposite, you can replace explicit types with `var`s by using the Local variable type can be omitted inspection. Note that you don’t need to know the full or exact name of an inspection, as you can search for it in the popup. There are many inspections available for different languages and frameworks, including Java, Kotlin, and Spring.\nEnter inspection name\n\n\n\nSelect the scope to run this inspection on, and select either Analyze or Fix all: \nIf you’re sure you want to apply the suggested fix everywhere in your selected scope, click Fix all. \nIf you’d like to see what might change first or apply individual fixes, select Analyze.\nInspection Scope\n\n\n\nIf you select Analyze, the Problems tool window opens. The tab Inspections on <selected scope> shows the Inspection Results on the left and a description of the inspection on the right.\nInspection Results\n\n\n\nInspection Results show the files that have problems based on the inspection you ran. Some files might have multiple occurrences of the problem; expand the files to see them all and click the file to open a preview on the right. Here, you have the option to either execute the suggested fix, in this example, Replace ‘var’ with explicit type, or Suppress the warning. Double-click the file to open it in the editor, fix any problems there, and check the results.\nIf you have selected Fix instead of Analyze, you can open the Commit tool window (⌘0 on macOS / Alt+0 on Windows/Linux) to look at the applied changes.\nRelated problems\nIf you’re making changes to your code that lead to problems elsewhere in your code base, IntelliJ IDEA will warn you with an inlay hint, for example if you change the method signature of a method that is called elsewhere. This works for classes and fields as well.\nRelated problems\n\n\n\nCheck for problems when committing new code\nYou can also configure IntelliJ IDEA to analyze your code when you create a commit and which checks should be performed on your commits. To do so, select Show Commit Options from the Commit tool window (⌘0 on macOS) / Alt+0 on Windows/Linux).\nShow Commit Options\n\n\n\nIf you select Analyze code here, IntelliJ IDEA will run the inspections according to the chosen profile on the changed file(s) in your commit.\nAnalyze code\n\n\n\nSuppose IntelliJ IDEA finds any code that may need your attention. In that case, a popup will appear in the bottom right corner, with the message Commit contains problems and listing the number and severity of these problems. Click Review code analysis to open the Code Analysis tab in the Problems tool window. Double-click any of the problems to navigate to that problem in the code and use ⌥⏎ (macOS) or Alt+Enter (Windows/Linux) to fix them. Amend your commit to include those fixes (if you haven’t pushed your commit), or create a new commit with your fixes.\nCommit contains problems\n\n\n\nFind problems throughout the project\nYou may also want to check for any problems throughout your entire project. Run inspections across your entire project using Code / Inspect Code from the main menu. Alternatively, open the Problems tool window (⌘6 on macOS) / Alt+6 on Windows/Linux), go to the Project Errors tab, and select Inspect Code… there.\n\n\n\n\nYou can specify the scope to run the inspections on and the profile to use. Use the Project Default profile, or create a custom profile. A custom profile can be used to run a subset of inspections or to include some inspections that are not run as part of the default profile. For example, if you are upgrading from one Java version to the next, you might want to create a profile to run relevant inspections, like the Java / Java language level migration aids. \nJava language level migration aids\n\n\n\nTo create a custom profile, go to Settings / Editor / Inspections. Click on the Settings icon, select Duplicate, and change the profile name. Next, select the inspections you want to include in this profile. \nIf you want to add only a handful of inspections to the profile, start with none by clicking on Reset to Empty to unselect all inspections. Select the inspections you want to include in this profile and click OK. Now, when you run Inspect Code, you can select the newly created profile.\n\n\n\n\nCustom Profile\n\n\n\nSimilar to when you run an inspection by name, IntelliJ IDEA will show any potential problems in the Problems tool window in the Inspections on <selected scope> tab. The Inspection Results are grouped into categories, with their severity shown. To group them differently, for example, by severity, open the View Options and select Severity. You can expand the Inspection Results to drill down to a specific result to see what the problem is and how to fix it.\nNote that project-wide inspections only work on Java projects.\nRun inspections in CI/CD pipelines with Qodana\nIn addition to running inspections in your IDE, you can inspect your code using Qodana. Using Qodana, you can run IntelliJ IDEA inspections locally and include them in your CI/CD pipelines, which we will discuss later.\nTo try out Qodana, you can enable Qodana locally for your project by going to the Problems tool window (⌘6 on macOS) / Alt+6 on Windows/Linux) and clicking on the button Try Locally.\nQodana – Try locally\n\n\n\nThis will add a `qodana.yaml` configuration file to your project and run Qodana inspections on your project as defined in that configuration file. You can see the Inspection Results in the Problems tool window / Server-Side Analysis tab or open them in the browser using the link Open Qodana report in browser. See the results in your browser and add additional inspections to your configuration as needed.\nTry Qodana\n\n\n\nYou can also run Qodana in your CI/CD pipelines. This allows you to run resource-consuming inspections in your CI/CD pipelines and to enforce quality standards with quality gates in your CI system. It enables you to access inspections that are only available in Qodana, like license audits and security checks, for example, finding hard-coded passwords in your code base. In addition, you can access historical overviews of inspection results and compare the current state of your project with a baseline to see new, unchanged, and resolved problems.\nAdd Qodana to CI/CD pipeline\n\n\n\nTo integrate Qodana with your CI system, have a look at the documentation. Integration guides are available for the most popular CI tools. If you’d like to learn how to integrate Qodana static analysis into your project, we recommend watching this livestream.\nQodana now also includes Spring-specific inspections. You can find the full list of inspections for Spring Framework in IntelliJ IDEA under Settings / Editor / Inspections by searching for “Spring” to filter out irrelevant inspections. For more information on inspections for Spring, see this blog post.\nOverview of inspections\nYou can see the full list of inspections in your IDE. Open Settings (⌘, on macOS) / Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows/Linux), and go to Editor / Intentions. Inspections are grouped by languages and frameworks.\nSettings – Inspections\n\n\n\nEach group has a checkbox next to it. A check mark indicates that all inspections in this category have been enabled. A missing check mark or any other mark indicates that all inspections have been disabled, and a minus sign indicates that some of the inspections are enabled and some are disabled, which also means that not all the inspections are enabled by default. You can enable or disable inspections depending on how applicable they are to your project. You can also change the severity of inspections, for example, if you want to make sure to use new language features.\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can find more information about available inspections on the Inspectopedia website.\nConclusion\nRunning automated checks on your project can help you find and fix problems throughout your entire project. Run checks locally using IntelliJ IDEA and/or Qodana, or add automated checks to your CI/CD pipeline using Qodana. You can use inspections to improve the style and quality of your code, as well as to prevent security issues.\nIn the next part of this series, we will look at some more advanced code analysis features in IntelliJ IDEA.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2024/10/compose-multiplatform-1-7-0-released/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 16 Oct 2024 10:58:27 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Compose Multiplatform is a declarative UI framework built by JetBrains that allows developers to share UI implementations across different platforms. The 1.7.0 release brings more components to common code, support for type-safe navigation, significant performance improvements on iOS, and changes from the latest Jetpack Compose update.\nHere are the highlights of this release:\nMaterial3 adaptive and WindowSizeClass are now available in common code.\nCompose Multiplatform now provides compile-time safety for your navigation graph.\nCompose Multiplatform 1.7.0 paired with Kotlin 2.0.20 performs significantly faster and smoother on iOS than the combination of previous stable releases.\n\n\n\n\nFor the complete list of changes, refer to our What’s New page or release notes on GitHub.\nGet Started with Compose Multiplatform\nNew common modules\nWith Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0, the following components have become available in common code:\nMaterial3 adaptive modules from material3.adaptive, such as adaptive, adaptive-layout, and adaptive-navigation.\nThe Material3 adaptive navigation suite.\nMaterial3 WindowSizeClass classes.\nThe material-navigation library.\nType-safe navigation\nYou can now rely on Compose Multiplatform for compile-time safety in navigation graphs. To ensure type safety, we adopted Jetpack Compose’s type-safe approach to passing objects along a navigation route.\nSee the Type safety in Navigation Compose guide for API details.\nPerformance improvements on iOS\nIn Kotlin 2.0.20, the Kotlin/Native team contributed significantly to making Compose apps on iOS perform faster and smoother. The Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0 release makes the best of these optimizations, along with performance improvements from Jetpack Compose 1.7.0.\nWe benchmarked Compose Multiplatform 1.6.11 paired with Kotlin 2.0.0 and Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0 paired with Kotlin 2.0.20, and the comparison shows the following improvements:\nThe LazyGrid benchmark simulates LazyVerticalGrid scrolling, which is closest to real-life use cases, and performs ~9% faster on average. It also shows a significantly reduced number of missed frames. Take a look at the p1/p50 percentile graph below: It shows increased frame stability and confirms that there are now hardly any missed frames, as the average processing time is less than the standard 8.33 ms latency of a 120Hz iPhone screen.\nThe VisualEffects benchmark renders many randomly placed components and works 3.6 times faster – the average CPU time per 1000 frames was reduced from 8.8 to 2.4 seconds.\nThe AnimatedVisibility composable animates showing and hiding an image and demonstrates ~6% faster rendering.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to test it yourself and let us know whether your iOS app feels smoother!\nOn top of that, Kotlin 2.0.20 introduces experimental support for concurrent marking in the garbage collector (GC). Enabling concurrent marking shortens GC pauses and demonstrates even bigger improvements for all benchmarks. We measured only half as many missed frames as before, as well as a drop in the worst p25 GC pause time from 1.7 ms to 0.4 ms for the LazyGrid benchmark. Give it a try and share your feedback.\nUpdate to Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0\nImproved touch interop between Compose Multiplatform and native iOS\nThis release improves touch handling for iOS interop views. Imagine a large interop video player used in a scrollable context such as a lazy list – it would be quite an unpleasant experience to scroll through the list when most of the screen is taken up by a video that intercepts all touches while Compose Multiplatform is unaware of them.\nCompose Multiplatform now tries to detect whether a touch is meant for an interop view or should be processed by Compose. This makes it possible to process touch events that happen in a UIKit or a SwiftUI area inside your Compose Multiplatform app.\nCheck out our Handling touch events with interop on iOS documentation page for details.\nDrag and drop on desktop\nCompose Multiplatform 1.7.0 implements drag and drop for desktop. You can now use the dragAndDropSource and dragAndDropTarget modifiers to specify which composable is a starting drag point and which one accepts the dropped data.\n\n                        \n\n\nShared element transitions\nCompose Multiplatform now supports seamless transitions between composables that share consistent elements. These transitions are often useful in navigation, helping users follow the trajectory of changes in the UI. Check out the Jetpack Compose documentation for details on API and Android samples, and give the new animation a try on other platforms.\n\n                        \n\n\nResources updates and improvements\nThis release brings a variety of updates for resources – let’s take a look at the most notable ones:\nThe resource library now supports using test resources in Compose Multiplatform projects.\nAll multiplatform resources are now packed into Android assets, allowing Android Studio to generate previews for Compose Multiplatform composables in Android source sets.\nYou can now directly access Android resources via URI from external libraries such as WebView and media player.\nThe new customDirectory setting in the configuration DSL allows you to associate a custom directory with a specific source set.\nResources are now mapped to string IDs for easy access.\nWhat else to read\nCompose Multiplatform 1.7.0 – release notes on GitHub\nWhat’s new in Compose Multiplatform 1.7.0 – detailed release notes on the documentation portal\nGet started with Compose Multiplatform – tutorial\nKotlin 2.0.20 Released – blog post",

        "pubDate": "Thu, 10 Oct 2024 15:18:14 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This new version uses Kotlin 2.0 and switches to kotlinx-io, making Ktor more up to date and better connected with other Kotlin tools. Ktor 3.0 works faster and gives you more options for building client-server applications.\nIf you’re new to Ktor or need a reminder about how it works, our recent blog post, Ktor 101: Efficient JVM HTTP Toolkit, explains its main features.\nThe following post will give you a solid overview of what’s new and improved in Ktor 3.0.\nBuild now with Ktor 3.0!\n\n\n\n\nMigrating to kotlinx-io\nThe biggest change in this new version is the switch to the kotlinx-io library, which is based on Okio. This change may affect you if you use Ktor’s low-level IO APIs. We made this change to standardize IO functionality across Kotlin libraries and improve performance, as shown in our benchmarks.\nBreaking changes\nThe changes mainly affect low-level IO APIs, including classes like Input, Output, ByteReadChannel, and ByteWriteChannel. If you use these classes directly, you’ll see deprecation warnings. You should update your code to use the alternatives provided by the kotlinx-io library. Don’t worry – we’ll keep supporting the old APIs until version 4.0, giving you ample time to migrate.\nThe new kotlinx-io library offers a multiplatform API that can handle various data sources and provides a range of capabilities, including working with files, using compression, and more. For more details, check out the kotlinx-io API documentation.\nPerformance improvements\nBy switching to kotlinx-io, we’ve cut down on the unnecessary copying of bytes between ByteReadChannel, ByteWriteChannel, and network interfaces. This allows for more efficient byte transformations and parsing, making room for future performance improvements.\nOur IO benchmark tests, based on real-world Ktor applications, show impressive results. Some tests saw over 90% improvement, and we’re working on even more enhancements.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport for server-sent events (SSE)\nIn Ktor 3.0, we added the initial support for server-sent events (SSE) both for the server and the client.\nServer-sent events is a technology that enables servers to push events to clients over an HTTP connection. SSE provides a one-way communication channel from the server to the client. This approach is useful for scenarios where the server needs to send event-based updates without requiring the client to repeatedly poll for new information.\nTo implement SSE support in the Ktor application, first, add the SSE dependency to your project’s build script:\nimplementation(\"io.ktor:ktor-server-sse-jvm\")\n\n\n\n\nNext, install the SSE plugin in your Ktor application, and create an endpoint using the sse{} function:\nimport io.ktor.server.application.*\nimport io.ktor.server.engine.*\nimport io.ktor.server.netty.*\nimport io.ktor.server.routing.*\nimport io.ktor.server.sse.*\nimport io.ktor.sse.*\nimport kotlinx.coroutines.delay\n\nfun main() {\n   embeddedServer(Netty, port = 8080) {\n       install(SSE)\n       routing {\n           sse {\n               repeat(42) {\n                   val name = call.parameters[\"name\"] ?: \"World\"\n                   send(ServerSentEvent(data = \"Hello, $name! $it\"))\n                   delay(1000)\n               }\n               close()\n           }\n       }\n   }.start(wait = true)\n}\nWithin the sse {...} block, you have access to a ServerSSESession instance with the following capabilities.\nsend(): Create and send a ServerSentEvent to the client.\ncall: Access the associated ApplicationCall that initiated the session.\nclose(): End the session and terminate the connection with the client.\nPlease note that currently, Ktor does not provide support for data compression of SSE responses. If you use the Compression plugin, it will skip compression for SSE responses by default.\nTo consume the events using the Ktor client, in the simplest case, you only need to invoke the sse function on the client instance as follows:\nimport io.ktor.client.*\nimport io.ktor.client.engine.cio.*\nimport io.ktor.client.plugins.sse.*\nimport kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking\n\nfun main() {\n   val client = HttpClient(CIO) {\n       install(SSE)\n   }\n\n   runBlocking {\n       client.sse(host = \"127.0.0.1\", port = 8080, path = \"/sse\") {\n           incoming.collect { event -> println(event) }\n       }\n   }\n}\nIn the example above, the client will consume the events as long as the server is sending the data.\nServing static resources from ZIP archives\nThe new function, staticZip, allows users to serve the contents of a ZIP archive as static content. \nHere’s a basic example of how to use it:\nrouting {\n   staticZip(\n       remotePath = \"/\",\n       basePath = \"base\", \n       Path(\"files/text-files.zip\")\n   ) {\n       default(\"file.txt\")\n\n       //modify the response by adding the HTTP Etag header\n       modify { path, call ->\n           call.response.headers.append(HttpHeaders.ETag,\n        path.fileName.toString())\n       }\n   }\n}\nLet’s break down the example into the key components:\nremotePath – the base URL path where the ZIP contents will be accessible.\nbasePath – the base path within the ZIP file you wish to serve. In our example, we assume that the ZIP archive contains the base directory. All paths inside the specified basePath will be accessible recursively at \"remotePath/path/to/resource\". This means you can organize your ZIP file with subfolders, and they’ll be reflected in the URL structure.\nPath(\"files/text-files.zip\")– the path to the ZIP file you want to serve.\nThe default() function – this allows you to specify a default file to serve if no specific file is requested.\nThe modify block – this enables you to customize the response. In this example, we’re adding an ETag header based on the file name.\nSee the full example on the Ktor samples repository on GitHub.\nSupport for CSRF\nSupport for CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection was added with the new plugin. Protection is enabled for state-changing operations including POST, PUT, and DELETE.\nGenerally, it’s applicable only for projects that use session cookies and forms, since enabling this can unnecessarily complicate your application.\nTo enable CSRF support in the Ktor application, first, add the following dependency to your project’s build script:\nimplementation(\"io.ktor:ktor-server-csrf-jvm\")\nNext, you can enable the CSRF protection for the selected routes in the application as follows:\nroute(\"/csrf\") {\n   install(CSRF) {\n       allowOrigin(\"https://localhost:8080\")\n\n       originMatchesHost()\n\n       checkHeader(\"X-CSRF\") { csrfHeader ->\n           request.headers[HttpHeaders.Origin]?.let { origin ->\n               csrfHeader == origin.hashCode().toString(32) // 1ndrgg9\n           } == true\n       }\n\n       onFailure {\n           respondText(\"Access denied!\", status = HttpStatusCode.Forbidden)\n       }\n   }\n   post {\n       call.respondText(\"CSRF check was successful\")\n   }\n}\nIn the configuration block, the plugin provides a few methods for verifying the requests:\nallowOrigin specifies that only the requests from the predefined origin are allowed. In our example, it’s https://localhost:8080.\noriginMatchesHost enforces that the request’s origin must match the application’s host.\ncheckHeader enables arbitrary header validation.\nIf you run the application with the code above and send a POST request to the /csrf endpoint using the curl command, you will see the following:\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{}' http://localhost:8080/csrf\nAccess denied!\nAdding the required headers will make it pass the checks:\ncurl -X POST -H \"X-CSRF: 1ndrgg9\" -H \"Origin: http://localhost:8080\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" --data '{}' http://localhost:8080/csrf\nCSRF check passed!\nKtor client for Wasm\nThe Ktor client now supports WebAssembly (Wasm) as a build target. While Kotlin/Wasm is still in its early stages (Alpha), adding Wasm support to the Ktor client is an important step in expanding the Kotlin Multiplatform ecosystem. To showcase this new capability, we’ve created a sample Compose Multiplatform project that uses the Ktor client with a WebAssembly (wasmJs) target.\nTo use the Ktor client, you need to add the corresponding dependency to your project’s build script:\nimplementation(\"io.ktor:ktor-client-core:$ktor_version\")\nMigration Guide\nKtor 3.0 brings some significant changes. We have prepared a migration guide for you to make the transition easier. Here, we highlight the most notable changes.\nWhether you upgrade your existing projects to Ktor 3.0 or not, you can start building your new projects with Ktor 3.0 right away!\nStart a new project with Ktor 3.0\nExplicit loading of modules﻿ in TestApplication\nFrom now on, the TestApplication class requires explicit loading of modules. The following test will start an empty application and will not load any modules:\n @Test\n fun testRoot() = testApplication {// TestApplication scope\n   client.get(\"/\").apply {\n     assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, status)\n     assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", bodyAsText())\n   }\n }\nInstead, you must explicitly load your modules within the testApplication function or load the configuration file manually.\n@Test\n fun testRoot() = testApplication {\n   application {\n     configureRouting()\n   }\n   client.get(\"/\").apply {\n     assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, status)\n     assertEquals(\"Hello World!\", bodyAsText())\n   }\n }\nPlugin updates\nThe CallLogging plugin package has been renamed, fixing a typo:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Locations plugin has been replaced with the new Resources plugin for type-safe routing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese changes aim to improve Ktor’s architecture, security, and developer experience. Users upgrading from Ktor 2.x should refer to the detailed migration guide to ensure a smooth transition to the new version.\nWhat else to read and watch\n📰 The Ktor Roadmap for 2024\n📰 The Ktor Plugin Registry Has Launched!\n📰 Ktor 101: Efficient JVM HTTP Toolkit\n🎥 Managing Complexity With Ktor \n🎥 Extending Ktor: Unleash the Full Potential of Kotlin’s Web Framework\nYour Ktor team\nJetBrains\nThe Drive to Develop",

You can download it for free from the link below, via the Toolbox App, or as a snap package if you’re using Ubuntu.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 EAP\nThis build includes new features for embedded development, such as debug servers, the ability to edit peripheral register values, and support for debugging Zephyr West projects. Also, while debugging, you can now view string values that contain newline characters or JSON, XML, or HTML data with the relevant formatting.\nDebug servers\nConfiguring debugging for embedded systems can be challenging, especially when working with different boards, probes, and run/debug configurations. We’ve decided to streamline this process by adding a new Debug Servers configuration option. It’s a separate section in Settings | Debugger where you can set up a debug server based on gdbserver. This new feature offers two great advantages:\nUsing a pre-configured debug server, you can run any run/debug configuration or build system target, such as CMake, West, Makefile, etc. Previously, you had to set up a separate run/debug configuration for each build system.\nThis also allows you to run long-living debug server sessions, meaning the server does not shut down when you stop debugging.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that this is an experimental feature. It’s intended to provide a simpler and more intuitive approach to debug configuration than the current version of CLion offers. We encourage you to try it and share your feedback. We would also be happy to arrange a quick call with you to learn more about your specific use cases and challenges.\nHow to get started\nTo use debug servers, first enable them in Settings | Advanced Settings | Debugger. Then, you’ll be able to find the Debug Servers dialog in Settings | Debugger or via Edit Debug Servers from the main toolbar switcher.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Debug Servers dialog, you can select from two template types:\nGeneric templates are more customizable and offer a wider range of options for any debug probe. \nSEGGER J-Link templates are specifically designed for J-Link debug probes. They are more straightforward and less flexible than generic ones, providing only the necessary options.\n\n\n\n\nAfter you configure your debug server, it will be available in the Debug Servers switcher in the main toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional features\nIf you already have a gdbserver run configuration in CLion, the IDE will recognize it and allow you to import it into a generic template. You can also convert a SEGGER J-Link configuration into a generic one, which allows you to customize the debug server in more detail.\nAdditionally, in the Debugger tab, we’ve added a new option for remote debugging, Persistent connection (target extended-remote), which maintains the connection to the debug server even after the session is closed. Using a persistent connection is useful when you want a debug server to be ready for the next session without having to wait for it to start back up. It’s often used in embedded development and is recommended by OpenOCD as the default mode.\nEditable peripheral register values\nWhen debugging board peripherals like GPIO pins or timers, you can immediately see the effects of your changes by editing peripheral registers. This allows you to test different configurations and device states without recompiling your source code or reloading your application or board.\nThe ability to edit register values was one of the most requested features (CPP-16747), and we’ve added it in this EAP. You can now change register values during debugging sessions in the Peripherals pane of the Debug tool window.\n\n\n\n\nFormatted view for strings with JSON, XML, or HTML data\nC++ string variables can store JSON, XML, and HTML data for configuration management, parsing structured data, and other purposes. Debugging such strings, as well as those containing newline characters (\\n), is now more convenient, as you can view them directly in the debugger formatted according to their code style (CPP-40257). You no longer need to copy unformatted values into a third-party tool to examine them.\n\n\n\n\nTo view a string’s values, click the View button, which is displayed next to it in the Threads & Variables pane. A separate dialog will appear where you can view the values as formatted or raw data.\nDebugging support for West\nWe added support for Zephyr West in CLion 2024.2. In this EAP, we’ve extended the initial functionality, adding the ability to debug West projects. This makes it easy to configure and run debugging sessions directly in the IDE.\nWhen you import your Zephyr West project, a West run/debug configuration is automatically created in the Run/Debug Configurations switcher.\nYou can also create a new run/debug configuration. Simply select Run | Edit Configurations… in the main menu, click +, and select a Zephyr West template:\n\n\n\n\nYou can copy the command line arguments you used to run west debug and paste them into the Debug options field.\nOnce configured, the new West run/debug configuration will be available in the Run/Debug Configurations switcher. You can launch a debug session using the green Debug button on the main toolbar or the shortcut – ⌃D (macOS) or Shift+F9 (Windows/Linux).\n\n\n\n\nOther new features in this EAP\nTo learn more about other recent improvements in the 2024.3 EAP, check out these blog posts:\nThe CLion 2024.3 Early Access Program Is Open covers enhanced cloud code completion, CLion Nova updates, and features for embedded development.\nCLion 2024.3 EAP 3 highlights the OpenCV image viewer and the ability to attach the debugger to unstarted processes.\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 EAP\nCall for feedback\nYour feedback is important to us, as your experiences and insights are essential to our mission of continuously improving CLion.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I learn so much from watching conference talks, especially live, when I’m vibing with the crowd. But sometimes I watch and think: “Wow, I wish I could show you how awesome that would be in PyCharm.”\nThat just happened. Here’s the explainer, with a little special something at the end.\nHello, DjangoConf\nI recently attended DjangoConf 2024 which kicked off this year’s DSF-PyCharm fundraiser. I attended Felipe’s DRF tutorial where he showed off using PyCharm and even a little bit about endpoints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfterwards, I ran into a PyCharm fan who told me what he really likes when using PyCharm for Django. It matched what I really like. Hence, a blog post.\n\n\nThe end is the point\nMy superfan friend was an early adopter of endpoints, our feature for rethinking the API developer experience (DX) in Django, FastAPI, and Flask. Me too. It’s cool to have a listing of endpoints, jumping to the definition, and most of all – issuing an HTTP request right there in the IDE. No going out to Postman. \n\n\n\n\nI covered endpoints and the HTTP client in my previous blog post. One extra point: he said Postman pricing is going up. I guess I should talk more about the HTTP Client.\nAlways be debugging\nMost folks know that I’m a debugger stan, probably because I just won’t shut up about it. It turns out that he also uses the debugger first, meaning he runs the Django server, under the debugger, all the time, even when he isn’t debugging.\n\n\n\n\nWhy? First, it’s so fast, you don’t notice the speed hit. As he also knew, Python 3.12 lowers the impact of debugging and PyCharm uses this automatically. The bigger point though: when you want to poke around, you don’t need to stop the regular “run”, launch under “debug”, then return to “run.” That’s disruptive, so people just do print. Which makes me a sad panda.\nIf you’re always debugging, then poking around is already RIGHT THERE. Even if you don’t have a bug and just want to investigate. Even if you are in a template.\n\n\n\n\nThis is great with endpoints, as you can click a breakpoint in your code and issue a request without leaving the tool.\nHe made one last point – PyCharm’s Django support and debugger is more mature and polished. We’ve been doing this for a while!\nI didn’t know there would be a test\nThere’s one more step to the higher-zen of using PyCharm to the fullest with Django. Why use the browser or an HTTP client at all? Why not just sit in a test module and let PyCharm + pytest bring joy to your world? In fact – don’t even run Django. No server process, less hassle.\nDjango makes it really easy to issue fake requests in a test, get the results back, and make sure things are cool. I like having my code on the left, my test on the right, and the test output on the bottom. In fact, I also like combining Always Be Testing with Always Be Debugging, which makes it crazy-easy to stop in the middle of a view and see what’s going on.\nI like it so much, here’s a little video:\n\n\n\n\nThis works great for how code works. You can skip going to the browser, reloading, and poking around. You stay in the IDE, the flow. But there’s a catch.\nSeeing is believing\nSometimes you need to see how the page looks. In the browser. With your eyeballs. Any chance PyCharm can improve the DX for this?\nAs it turns out, in 2023.3 we shipped Django Preview, a feature-rich browser in the IDE that keeps up as you type.\n\n\n\n\nA love letter to Django\nThis concludes my speaking from the heart about my way of doing Django API development in PyCharm: endpoints, debugger, testing, and preview.\nBut I’d like to close by speaking from the heart about Django, leading with an odd little twist of fate about Django killing my project.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Do you ever wish you could quickly test different queries on your collections or datasets while debugging? Do you want to save time and avoid writing code just to inspect your data? If you answered yes, then you will love the new editable expression feature in the Visual Studio debugger.\nThis feature allows you to modify the expressions textbox on the top of the IEnumerable visualizer dialog with your desired LINQ expressions. The visualizer updates in real-time, reflecting the data change resulting from your query. You can easily apply different filters or sort orders to your collections based on your needs.\nIn this blog post, we will show you how to use this powerful feature and how it can help you debug more efficiently and effectively.\nGetting started\nIn a debugging session, launch the IEnumerable visualizer by hovering over a collection or dataset variable in the debugger and clicking on the magnifying glass icon. Alternatively, you can right-click on the variable and select View Visualizer from the context menu.\n\nThis will open the IEnumerable visualizer dialog, where you will see the expressions textbox on the top. You can type any valid LINQ expression in this textbox and hit <ENTER> to apply it to your collection. The visualizer will update the data grid below with the result of your query.\n\nUse cases for editable expressions\nThe editable expression feature can be very useful for debugging dense datasets and complex collection manipulations. You can experiment with different data transformations and filters directly within the Visual Studio debugger, without having to write any code or switch to another tool.\nFor example, suppose you have a collection of products that you want to inspect. You can use the editable expression feature to filter out the products that are out of stock, sort them by price, and select only the name and price properties. Here is how you can do that:\n\nAs you can see, the editable expression feature allows you to quickly and easily manipulate your data and see the results in the visualizer. You can also copy the expression from the textbox and paste it into your code if you want to use it in your application logic.\nGive us your feedback\nWe hope you enjoy using the editable expression feature in the Visual Studio debugger. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions on how we can improve it further. Please leave a comment below or use the Report a Problem tool in Visual Studio to let us know what you think.\nWe also want to thank you for your continuous feedback and support, which helps us make Visual Studio better for you. Stay tuned for more exciting features and updates coming soon!\nHappy debugging!\nThe post Improve your debugger game with editable expressions appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

ROEMO 스티커 아래 한개와 앞바퀴 옆 전극 옆 두개, 그리고 뒷바퀴 아래쪽 두개를 풀어줍니다.\n \n\n\n \n앞바퀴 바로 아래 파란색 배터리를 발견할 수 있습니다. 로이모 프로는 안 쓰지만 밑판을 다른 모델과 공유하는지 회전 브러쉬를 위한 여분의 구멍도 있습니다.\n \n\n\n \n조심스럽게 꺼내서 커넥터를 분리한 원래의 배터리는 이렇게 생겼습니다. 5,200mAh 용량입니다.\n \n\n\n \n새 제품과 비교하면 크기가 거의 같죠. 원래 자리에 잘 들어갈 것 같습니다.\n \n\n\n \n중요한 연결 커넥터가 잘 맞습니다.\n \n\n\n \n이렇게 들어가네요.\n \n\n\n \n그리고 하루 쯤 충전하라고 놔둔 후 다시 작동해 봤더니 잘 됩니다. 처음 쓸 때처럼 온 집안을 한번에 다 청소할 수 있는 용량으로 거듭났네요.\n이렇게 로이모 프로 배터리 DIY 교체 작업은 해피엔딩으로 끝나나 했습니다만, 뭔가 찜찜한게 남았습니다.\n \n\n\n \n원래 있던 배터리 말입니다.\n \n\n\n \n분명히 로이모 프로의 상자에는 LG 배터리라고 적혀있는데,\n \n\n\n \n \n실제로 안에 들어있는 녀석은 LG가 아니라 BYD 제품이었습니다.\n \n......\n....\n..\n \n배터리로 시작해서 지금은 전기자동차까지 만드는 BYD가 그렇게까지 무시할만한 회사는 아니겠지만 그래도 기재되어 있는 정보와 다른 건 매우 실망스럽습니다.로이모 프로를 판매한 에스엔케이는 대체 왜 LG 배터리라고 홍보한 걸까요?\n \n몇년 동안 LG 배터리라 믿고 써 왔는데 사실은 중국산 BYD 배터리... 원효대사 해골물 생각납니다.\n \n로이모 프로(SYB2 Pro) 배터리 DIY 교체기는 정말 끝.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 소프트웨어가 핵심인, 소위 말하는 전통적인 테크 회사에도 많이 투자하지만, 겉으로 봤을 땐 테크가 핵심이 아닌 회사에도 많이 투자한다. 대표적인 사례가 소비자들이 일상생활에서 구매해서 사용하는 제품을 만드는 소비재 브랜드 회사들인데, 화장품, 음식, 의류 등이 이 카테고리에 포함된다. 우린 이 카테고리에 상당히 많이 투자했고, 지금도 계속 좋은 창업가가 있으면 투자하고 있는데, 이 분야에 투자하면 할수록 돈도 많이 들고, 안정적인 사업으로 성장하는 길이 멀고 험하다는 걸 매일 느끼면서 매일 새로운 것들을 배우고 있다.\n뭔가를 제조해서 판매한다는 건, 소프트웨어 사업의 큰 장점 중 하나인 “zero 한계 비용”의 이점이 없다는 뜻이다. 소프트웨어는 만드는 과정이 힘들고, 돈이 들지만, 일단 만들어 놓으면 한 개를 판매하나 10,000개를 판매하나 생산비는 증가하지 않지만, 반려동물 사료를 만드는 사업을 하면 1개 만들어서 판매하는 것과 10,000개 만들어서 판매하는 건, 들어가는 비용에 큰 차이가 난다.\n그리고 초기 스타트업이 자체적인 생산 시스템을 갖추는 건 어렵기 때문에 대부분 외부 공장에 OEM 제조를 위탁하는데, 이런 제조 방식에는 회사에 여러 가지로 불리한 단점이 존재한다. 일단 미래에 만들어질 매출에 대해서 오늘 제품을 만들어야 하는데, 그 제조 비용은 대부분 매출이 만들어지기 전에 100% 집행되어야 한다. 또한, 제조 수량이 많지 않으면 최소 주문 수량이라는 게 있어서 최소로 반드시 나가야 하는 비용이 발생한다. 예를 들어 제조 비용이 3,000원이고, 실제 판매가는 10,000원인 사료를 10,000개 만들기 위해서는 공장에 오늘 즉시 지급해야 하는 비용은 3,000만 원이다. 물론 이 3,000만 원으로 만드는 제품이 다 팔리면 우리에게 들어오는 매출은 1억 원이라서 두 개의 숫자만 비교해 보면 좋은 사업이지만, 1억 원이라는 매출이 앞으로 3개월에 걸쳐서 입금될지, 2년에 걸쳐서 입금될지 모르기 때문에 항상 현금이 잠기는 문제가 발생한다. 그리고 중간 중간에 계속 여러 가지 제품을 제조해야 하므로 나가는 돈은 항상 발생하는데, 이게 매출로 회수되려면 너무 오랜 시간이 걸려서 항상 재정 상태는 좋지 않다. 여기에다가 시장의 인지도가 낮은 새로운 제품이기 때문에 계속 마케팅해야 하는데, 이렇게 따져보면 어느 정도 인지도가 발생하고, 어느 정도 판매 물량이 항상 보장되기 전까지, 이런 사업은 절대로 돈을 벌 수가 없는 악성 사이클에 빠지게 된다.\n이런 사업이 조금이라도 현금 걱정 없이 사업을 하기 위해서는 그 회사 자체가 좋은 브랜드가 돼야 한다. 단순히 좋은 제품을 팔기 위해서는 이 제품이 왜 좋고, 어떤 장점들이 있는지를 한없이 홍보해야 한다. 여기엔 그만큼 마케팅 비용이 필요한데, 좋은 제품이 잘 팔리는 건 회사엔 축복이지만, 그 뒤의 현금 흐름은 축복이 아니라 저주가 될 수 있다. 제품이 계속 팔리면, 결국엔 이 제품을 계속 주문하고 만들어야 하는데 이게 다 돈이다. 그리고 계속 마케팅해야 하는데 이 또한 다 돈이다. 그렇다고 다른 회사들은 가만히 있을까. 경쟁사들이 계속 출현해서 서로 더 좋은 제품이라고 마케팅하므로 마케팅 비용은 계속 오른다. 아마도 이런 사업을 하는 대표들은 내가 무슨 말을 하는지 잘 알 것이다. 매일매일 경험하는 현상이니까.\n이 악성 고리를 끊기 위해서는, 우리 제품이 좋다고 마케팅할 필요가 없는 뭔가 강력한 한 방이 필요한데, 이게 바로 좋은 브랜드가 되는 것이다. 좋은 브랜드는 좋은 제품보다 한 단계 위에 있는 강력한 무형의 권력이다. 좋은 브랜드가 되어 소비자들의 머리와 가슴속에 그 브랜드가 각인되는 순간, 엄청난 해자가 만들어진다. 명품들이 그 대표적인 사례라고 난 생각한다. 샤넬이나 에르메스 같은 명품은 워낙 강력한 브랜드가 됐기 때문에, 이들이 만드는 제품은 소비자들이 웬만하면 따지지도 않고 묻지도 않고 그냥 구매한다. 그냥 “저 브랜드가 만드는 제품은 당연히 좋지.”라는 생각이 아주 강하게 뇌리에 박히고, 그 생각은 자연스럽게 손으로 이어지면서 지갑을 열게 된다.\n그래서 우리가 투자사 대표들에게 항상 이야기하는 게 있는데, “가장 강력한 해자는 특정 분야에 대해서 생각하자마자 가장 먼저 떠오르는 브랜드가 되는 것이에요. 즉, 영어에서 말하는 household brand가 되는 것만큼 강력한 진입장벽은 없습니다.”이다.\n하지만, 스타트업이 강력한 브랜드를 만들기 위해서 우리가 아는 많은 명품처럼 수백 년을 기다릴 순 없다. 한정된 돈, 시간, 자원을 기반으로 가장 빠른 시간 내에 가장 강력한 브랜드를 만들기 위해선 나만의 방식과 노력이 필요하다. 다시 원점으로 돌아오는 것 같지만, 좋은 브랜드가 되기 위해서는 기본적으로 가장 좋은 제품을 만들어야 하고, 가장 좋은 마케팅을 해야 한다. 그리고 일단은 소비자들에게 많이 노출돼야 하고, 많이 팔려야 한다. 제품이 좋지 않으면 아무리 많이 노출돼도 잘 안 팔리지만, 좋은 제품이라면 많이 노출되면 많이 팔린다. 이런 식으로 가면서 중간마다 계속 찾아오는 현금 흐름의 문제를 잘 해결하고, 망하지 않고 계속 링에서 버티다 보면 결국엔 누구나 다 알고 인정하는 브랜드를 만들 수 있다. \nGood luck.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 무라카미 하루키의 ‘직업으로서의 소설가’를 완전히 집중해서 정독했다. 내가 이 블로그에서 서평은 웬만하면 안 하는데, 정말 좋은 책을 읽은 후에는, 생각을 어느 정도 정리하고 가끔 올리긴 한다. 이전에 하루키의 에세이 ‘달리기를 말할 때 내가 하고 싶은 이야기’를 감명 깊게 읽어서 이 책에 대한 서평을 간략하게 올리긴 했고, 이 책은 지금까지 읽었던 책 중 내가 좋아하는 책 중 하나이다.\n‘직업으로서의 소설가’ 에세이도 나는 별 5개를 줬고, 이 책 대부분의 내용이 나에게 큰 울림을 줬다고 생각한다. 나는 하루키의 소설은 하나도 안 읽었지만, 에세이는 많이 읽었다. 에세이들의 주제와 내용은 다르지만, 모든 이야기에는 이 뛰어난 작가의 인생철학과 원칙이 잘 스며 있다고 생각한다. 그건 내가 지향하는 인생철학, 원칙과 비슷해서 더 재미있게 읽었고, 읽을수록 무라카미 하루키를 한 명의 작가로서 좋아하게 됐지만, 결국엔 한 명의 인간으로서 존경하게 된 것 같다. 내가 정의한 하루키의 인생철학과 원칙은 ‘꾸준함’과 ‘복리의 힘’이다. 그리고 내가 매번 강조하는 세상의 모든 큰일은 모두 작은 일을 계속 하는 것에서 시작된다는 믿음이다.\n이 책에서 가장 감명 깊게 읽었던 내용을 요약하자면 다음과 같다.\n우리가 보통 소설가라고 하면, 회사원보단 자유로운 영혼을 지닌 예술가라고 생각하는 경향이 크다. 그런데 하루키가 말하는 직업으로서의 소설가는 그냥 일반 직장인이랑 크게 다른 점이 없는 것 같다. 소설이란 특별한 재능을 갖고 태어난 소수만이 쓸 수 있는 게 아니라, 소설이라는 건 오히려 누구나 마음만 먹으면 쉽게 진입할 수 있는 프로레슬링이라고 하는데, 그 이유는 프로레슬링 링은 매우 넓고, 로프의 틈새도 넓고 편리한 발판도 있어서 누구나 다 올라갈 수 있기 때문이다. 링에 올라가는 걸 저지하는 경비원도 없고 심판도 빡빡하게 굴지 않아서, 그냥 어느 정도 기본 실력이 있거나, 연습을 좀 하면 다 올라갈 수 있는데, 마치 소설이 이와 비슷하다고 한다.\n하지만, 링에 오르기는 (상대적으로)쉬워도 거기서 오래 버티는 건 쉽지 않은데, 이게 소설 한두 편을 써내는 건 그다지 어렵지 않지만, 소설을 오래 지속적으로 쓰고, 소설로 먹고살고, 결국 소설가로서 살아남는다는 건, 정말 어렵다는 말이다.\n하루키는 이 책을 쓴 시점 기준으로 삼십 년이 넘는 시간 동안 아주 많은 사람들이 신인 작가로 등단하는 것을 봤는데, 이 중 현역 소설가로서 활동하고 있는 분은 거의 없다고 한다. 뛰어난 소설 한 편을 써내는 것은 쉬운 일은 아니지만, 사람에 따라서는 못할 정도는 아니다. 하지만, 소설을 지속적으로 써낸다는 것은 상당히 어렵고, 누구나 할 수 있는 일이 아니고, 이걸 하기 위해선 재능과는 다른 ‘어떤 특별한 자격’이 필요하다고 한다. 다행인 점은 이 자격은 선천적인 경우도 있지만 후천적으로 고생하면서 습득하는 게 충분히 가능하다는 점을 이 책에서 계속 강조한다. 그리고 나는 하루키가 강조하는 이 자격이라는 건 바로 꾸준함, 끈기, 그리고 복리의 힘이라고 확신한다.\n우리가 하는 투자도 마찬가지라고 생각한다. VC가 되는 건 아무나 할 수 있다. 누구나 투자자가 될 수 있고, 투자를 시작할 수 있다. 그리고 누구나 좋은 회사를 찾아서 한두 개의 좋은 투자를 할 수 있다고 생각한다. 즉, 링에는 누구나 다 올라갈 수 있다. 하지만, 아주 오랜 세월 동안 지속적으로 계속 투자하면서, 투자로 먹고살고, 직업으로서의 투자자가 되는 사람은 그렇게 많지 않다. 즉, 링에서 버틸 수 있는 투자자는 별로 없다. 하루키의 말을 그대로 빌려 쓰자면, 이건 단순히 좋은 투자자의 재능보단 특별한 자격이 필요한데, 이 자격 또한 후천적으로 습득하는 게 충분히 가능하다. 꾸준히 투자해야 하고, 작은 일을 계속 해서 아주 큰 일로 만들 수 있는 복리의 힘을 믿어야 한다.\n스트롱도 이제 12년을 잘 살아남았고, 앞으로의 12년도 잘하기 위해서는 좋은 투자자의 재능보단, 계속 이렇게 링 위에 올라가서 오래 버틸 수 있는 뭔가 특별한 자격이 필요하다. 나도 아직은 잘 모르겠지만, 한 20년 뒤엔 이게 뭔지 알 수 있길 바란다. 앞으로 몇 년은 투자자로서 링에서 계속 버틸 수 있는 자격이 무엇인지 공부하는 기간으로 삼아야겠다.\n그런데 내가 이야기 한 모든 것은 비단 소설가나 투자자에게만 적용되는 게 아니라, 창업가에게도 그대로 적용된다. 한 번 좋은 제품을 만들고, 한 번 좋은 투자를 받고, 한 번 좋은 밸류에이션을 받는 건, 다른 많은 창업가도 하지만, 이걸 계속 연속적으로, 오랜 세월 동안 지속하는 건 정말 어렵다.\n결국엔 꾸준함과 그리고 그 꾸준함이 만들어내는 복리의 힘을 믿고 실행해야 한다.",

들리더라고요.\n.css-12p6bv8{white-space:pre-wrap;color:#15c47e;font-weight:bold;}교수 K (이하 K):.css-1p9vrlv{white-space:pre-wrap;color:#15c47e;} 그러게요. 나들이하기 좋은 날씨에 점점 공연을 즐기는 분들이 많아지겠군요. 에디터 님은 어떤 공연을 가장 좋아하시나요?\nG: 사실 공연을 아주 즐기는 편은 아닌데요. 얼마 전 여름휴가 때 런던 웨스트엔드에서 뮤지컬을 보고 정말 감동받은 경험이 있어요. 이야기도 풍부하고 볼 거리, 들을 거리가 많은 뮤지컬을 선택할 수 있겠어요.\nK: 그렇군요. 저는 종종 내한 공연을 오는 해외 오케스트라의 공연에 관심을 가지는 편인데요. 2023년에 내한한 베를린 필하모닉 오케스트라의 공연이 클래식 음악 애호가들 사이에서 큰 화제를 모았었어요. ‘베를린 필하모닉’은 전 세계에서 가장 권위 있는 오케스트라 중 하나이기 때문에, 클래식 음악을 즐겨 듣는 사람이라면 누구나 한번 쯤은 직접 공연장에 가서 연주를 들어보고 싶어하겠죠.\n그러나, 유명한 오케스트라인 만큼 티켓 가격이 만만치 않았습니다. 가장 비싼 좌석의 가격은 50만 원이 넘었는데요. 유럽 현지에서 같은 오케스트라의 공연을 관람하는 것과 비교해보면 훨씬 높은 금액이었습니다.\nG: 맞아요. 뮤지컬도 해외에서 잘 된 공연이 국내에 들어올 때 가격이 더 높아지는 것 같았어요.\nK: 도대체 공연 티켓 가격은 어떻게 결정되는 것일까요? 오늘은 공연 티켓의 가격에 숨어 있는 경제학 원리를 한번 살펴보도록 하겠습니다.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n1. 공연 티켓의 가격 차별화 원리\nK: 공연 티켓은 ‘가격 차별’이 발생할 수 있는 대표적인 재화인데요. 예전에 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}학생 할인 아티클에서 살펴본 것처럼, 가격 차별은 동일한 재화나 서비스에 대해 소비자의 지불 능력이나 선호도에 따라 서로 다른 가격을 부과하는 전략입니다.\nG: 기억나요. 왜 항상 학생들은 할인 가격을 적용받는지에 대해, 각 구매자가 지불하려는 혹은 지불할 수 있는 가격에 맞춰 서로 다른 판매 가격을 책정하는 가격 차별 원리에 대해 설명해주셨었어요. 학생들은 직장인들에 비해 소득이 낮고 상대적으로 구매력이 떨어지니, 이런 특성을 고려해 학생과 일반인에게 서로 다른 가격을 매길 수 있다고요.\nK: 맞아요. 잘 기억하고 계시네요. 공연 티켓에서도 주로 사용되는 가격 차별화 역시 소비자를 여러 그룹으로 나누고, 각 그룹마다 서로 다른 가격을 책정하는 방식으로 이루어지는데요.\n가장 대표적인 것이 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}좌석 위치에 따른 가격의 차별화입니다. 소비자들의 지불 의사(willingness to pay)는 좌석의 위치에 따라 달라지며, 공급자는 이를 기반으로 다양한 가격대를 설정하게 됩니다. 예를 들어, 무대와 가까운 중앙 좌석은 관객들이 가장 선호하는 자리이므로 지불 의사가 가장 높습니다. 따라서 더 높은 가격을 부과할 수 있는 것이죠.\n다음으로, 무대와 어느 정도 거리가 있거나, 측면에 위치한 좌석은 시야와 음향에서 다소 불리하지만 여전히 관람 가치가 있는 자리로, 중간 가격대를 형성합니다. 반면, 무대에서 멀거나, 시야가 제한된 좌석은 공연을 감상하기에 최적의 위치가 아니므로, 관객의 지불 의사가 낮습니다. 이를 반영해 티켓 가격이 저렴하게 설정됩니다.\nG: 어떤 좌석에서 보는지에 따라 공연 경험이 달라질 수 있으니, 더 좋은 자리일 수록 더 비싸게 팔릴 수밖에 없겠어요.\nK: 그렇죠. 다음으로 생각해 볼 수 있는 것은 시간에 따른 가격 차별화입니다. 예를 들어, 공연 당일에 판매 되는 공연 티켓인 데이 시트(Day Seat)는 미리 예약된 티켓보다 저렴하게 제공되는 경우가 많습니다.\n일반적으로 공연장의 좌석 수는 한정되어 있고, 공연 날짜와 시간 역시 고정되어 있습니다. 공연일이 다가오는데 판매되지 않은 티켓은 그 자체로 매몰 비용(sunk cost)이 되는데요. 만약 남은 좌석이 판매되지 않으면, 그 좌석은 공연이 끝날 때까지 빈자리로 남아서 아무런 수익을 창출하지 못하게 됩니다.\n따라서 남은 좌석을 저렴하게라도 판매하여 수익을 확보하는 것이 공연 제작자에게는 더 유리합니다. 이와 같이 데이 시트 티켓은 공연 당일 남은 좌석을 저렴하게 판매함으로써 수익을 회수하는 전략입니다.\nG: 아무리 뮤지컬 본고장인 런던이라 해도 미리 예매하려니 너무 비싸서, 저도 데이 시트를 노렸었거든요. <라이온 킹> 뮤지컬을 Royal Circle 자리에서 봤는데, 50% 가까이 할인된 가격으로 구매할 수 있었어요. 데이시트 좌석은 대부분 한 자리씩 남는지라 일행과 떨어져서 봐야한다는 단점이 있지만… 그래도 저렴한 가격에 좋은 자리에서 멋진 뮤지컬을 감상할 수 있으니, 어느 정도 감수할 수 있었답니다.\nK: 데이 시트 장점을 정말 잘 활용하셨네요. 에디터 님처럼 당일에 티켓을 구매하는 사람들도 있지만, 좋은 자리를 미리 사수하고 싶어하는 사람들은 티켓을 미리 구매하려 할텐데요.\n이렇게 미리 티켓을 구매하는 소비자에게 할인을 제공할 수도 있답니다. 조기 예매 할인은 공연 기획자에게 초기 수요를 파악할 수 있다는 이점이 있거든요. 공연 티켓 판매가 어떻게 진행될지 미리 알 수 없는 상황에서, 조기 예매를 통해 수요를 예측하고 그에 따라 공연의 마케팅 및 운영 전략을 조정할 수 있는 것이죠.\n만약, 초기 판매가 부진하면 더 적극적인 홍보나 추가 할인을 고려할 수 있고, 수요가 높다면 가격을 유지하거나 인상할 수 있습니다. 공연이 임박한 시점에 티켓이 남아 있으면 매진되지 않을 위험이 있지만, 조기 예매로 일부 티켓을 미리 판매하면 이러한 위험을 줄일 수도 있고요.\n또한, 조기 예매 할인은 초기 매출을 확보하는 중요한 방법입니다. 공연 준비에는 상당한 비용(대관료, 인건비, 홍보비 등)이 들어가며, 이러한 비용을 충당하기 위해서는 초기 자금이 필요합니다. 조기 예매를 통해 일찍 매출을 확보함으로써, 공연 운영에 필요한 현금 흐름을 안정적으로 유지할 수 있는 것이죠.\nG: 얼마 전에 관심있는 사진전 티켓을 사전예약 판매한다는 광고를 봤는데, 정가의 50% 가격으로 판매하더라고요. 원래도 가고 싶었던 사진전이기도 하고 전시 기간 동안만 방문하면 되니, 어차피 갈거면 미리 구매하는게 이득이겠다 싶어서 티켓을 샀어요. 전시, 공연 기획자들에게 사전예약 판매는 여러모로 큰 장점이 있기 때문에 이 정도 할인율을 매기는 거군요!\nK: 맞아요. 공연 티켓 뿐 아니라 수많은 기업, 판매자들이 사전예약을 진행하는 이유가 다 여기에 있다 보시면 돼요.\n앞서 설명한 것과 같이, 좌석 위치와 시간에 따라서 공연 티켓의 가격을 다르게 매기는 현상의 기저에는 수요의 가격 탄력성(elasticity)이라는 경제학 원리가 숨어 있습니다. 수요의 가격 탄력성은 가격 변화에 따라 수요가 변하는 정도를 나타내는 개념입니다. 즉, 가격이 오르거나 내릴 때, 소비자의 수요가 얼마나 민감하게 반응하는지를 나타내는 것이죠.\nG: 가격 변화에 따라 수요가 변하는 정도를 나타낸다면, 각각의 상황을 어떻게 이해하는 것이 좋을까요?\nK: 탄력적(elastic) 수요는 가격이 조금만 올라가도 수요가 크게 줄어드는 경우인데요. 가격에 민감한 소비자들이 많을 때, 수요는 탄력적입니다.\n반면, 비탄력적(inelastic) 수요는 가격이 올라도 수요가 크게 변하지 않는 경우를 말합니다. 가격에 덜 민감한 소비자들이 많을 때, 수요는 비탄력적이죠.\nG: 아하! 그럼 공연 티켓도 이런 특성을 이용해 차별화된 가격이 설정될 수 있겠군요?\nK: 맞습니다. 조금 전 살펴본 것처럼 공연 주최자는 좌석 위치와 공연 시간에 따라 차별화된 가격을 책정함으로써 수익을 극대화하는데요. 이때 각 소비자 그룹의 수요의 ‘가격 탄력성’을 고려하게 됩니다.\n예를 들어, 무대와 가까운 프리미엄 좌석은 일반적으로 수요가 비탄력적입니다. 이 좌석을 원하는 관객들은 좋은 시야와 경험을 위해 더 높은 가격을 기꺼이 지불하려는 경향이 강하고, 가격 상승에 덜 민감해요. 즉, 티켓 가격이 높게 책정될 수 있습니다.\n반면, 무대에서 멀거나 시야가 제한된 좌석에 대한 수요는 일반적으로 탄력적입니다. 꼭 특정한 자리를 선호하는 것이 아니라, 공연 자체를 편하게 즐기러 오는 관객들이 많기 때문에 가격에 비교적 민감하게 반응할 수 있어요. 이 경우, 티켓 가격이 오르면 좌석에 대한 수요가 크게 줄어들 수 있겠죠. 따라서 공연 주최 측은 이 좌석들의 티켓 가격을 상대적으로 낮게 책정하여 더 많은 수요를 유도하려고 한답니다.\n실제로 작년에 내한한 베를린필의 공연 티켓의 경우, 가장 비싼 좌석의 가격은 50만 원이 넘었지만, 가장 낮은 등급의 좌석은 10만 원으로 책정되었어요. 좌석 위치에 따른 가격 차별화의 대표적인 예라고 할 수 있겠죠.\nG: 좌석 위치에 따라 소비자 그룹 수요의 가격 탄력성을 고려한다는 것은 이해가 됐어요. 그럼 공연 시간에 따라 다른 가격을 책정하는 것도 가격 탄력성 때문이라 볼 수 있나요?\nK: 그럼요. 공연 시간에 따라서도 수요의 가격 탄력성이 달라질 수 있습니다. 주말이나 저녁 시간대 공연에 대한 수요는 비탄력적인 경향이 있습니다. 이 시간대는 대부분의 사람들이 일하지 않는 시간대기 때문에, 관람을 선호하는 사람들이 많습니다. 이 시간대를 선택해야 하는 관객은 가격이 다소 오르더라도 여전히 티켓을 구매하려는 경향이 있습니다. 따라서 공연 주최 측은 이러한 시간대에 더 높은 가격을 설정할 수 있죠.\n반면, 평일 낮 시간대나 당일에 상연하는 공연 티켓은 상대적으로 탄력적 수요를 가집니다. 낮 시간이나 당일 티켓의 잠재적 구매자들은 상대적으로 가격에 민감하며, 가격이 높으면 수요가 크게 줄어들 수 있습니다. 이 때문에 공연 주최 측은 티켓 가격을 할인해서 더 많은 관람객을 유도하려고 하는 것이죠.\n2. 공연 종류 별로 티켓 가격에 차이가 나는 이유\nG: 교수님, 그렇다면 오페라, 연극, 클래식 콘서트 등 각 공연의 종류별로 티켓 가격에 차이가 나는 이유는 무엇일까요?\nK: 각 공연의 티켓 가격은 해당 공연의 특성, 비용 구조, 수요와 공급, 그리고 시장 경쟁 상황에 의해 결정되는데요.\n예를 들어, 오페라는 공연 예술 중에서도 가장 비싼 티켓 가격을 형성하는 경우가 많습니다. 대규모 오케스트라, 성악가, 무대 세트, 의상 등 다양한 측면에서 큰 비용이 발생하기 때문입니다.\n특히, 유명 성악가의 출연료와 화려한 무대 장치는 비용을 크게 증가시키는 요인입니다. 또한, 오페라 공연은 한정된 기간 동안만 열리며, 특정 작곡가의 작품이나 전 세계적으로 유명한 성악가가 참여하는 경우 희소성이 높아집니다.\n그리고 오페라 관객들은 상대적으로 가격 변화에 민감하지 않은 경향성이 있어요. 그 결과, 오페라 티켓의 가격은 다른 공연들에 비해 비싸게 매겨집니다.\n반면, 연극의 티켓 가격은 보통 오페라보다는 낮은 편입니다. 연극은 오페라에 비해 상대적으로 적은 인원과 기술적 장비를 요구하는 경우가 많습니다. 배우의 인건비를 제외하고는 세트, 음향, 조명 등의 비용이 상대적으로 적게 들어가기 때문에, 총 제작비가 낮습니다.\n또한, 연극 관객들은 오페라 관객보다 상대적으로 가격에 민감할 수 있습니다. 특히 실험적이거나 덜 알려진 작품일 경우 수요가 탄력적이기 때문에, 가격을 높게 설정하면 수요가 급감할 위험이 큽니다. 이는 연극 티켓 가격이 다른 공연들에 비해 상대적으로 낮게 설정되는 이유 중 하나입니다.\n클래식 콘서트의 경우, 공연의 규모나 연주자의 명성에 따라 티켓 가격에 차이가 납니다. 클래식 음악 연주는 고도의 기술을 요구하기 때문에 연주자들에게 지불해야 하는 인건비가 높습니다. 특히 유명 지휘자나 솔리스트의 출연료는 상당히 비싸기 때문에, 이 비용이 티켓 가격에 반영됩니다.\n또한, 특정 유명 오케스트라나 지휘자가 이끄는 클래식 공연은 자주 열리지 않기 때문에, 이러한 희소성이 티켓 가격을 높이는 요인이 됩니다. 수요가 공급을 초과하면 티켓 가격이 올라가기 때문이죠.\n다만, 일부 클래식 공연은 공공 또는 민간의 후원으로 보조를 받을 수 있어 티켓 가격이 상대적으로 낮게 책정될 수도 있습니다. 후원이 부족한 경우, 가격이 높게 유지될 가능성이 있고요.\n3. 해외 유명 오케스트라 공연 티켓이 비싼 이유\nG: 지금까지 교수님께서 알려주신 사실들을 바탕으로, 해외 오케스트라의 내한 공연이 왜 국내 오케스트라 공연보다 상대적으로 비싼지 설명할 수 있겠어요. 바로 ‘희소성' 때문이겠네요.\nK: 정확해요. 한국에서 해외 유명 오케스트라 공연에 대한 수요는 매우 높은 반면, 해외 오케스트라가 한국을 자주 방문할 수 없기 때문에 공급은 상대적으로 제한적입니다. 조금 전 말씀드린 것처럼, 수요와 공급의 불균형은 티켓 가격을 자연스럽게 끌어올리는 대표적인 요인이죠.\n다음으로 생각해볼 수 있는 것은 비용입니다. 세계적으로 유명한 오케스트라를 한국으로 초청하는 데는 출연료, 항공료, 악기 운반료, 숙박, 식사, 그리고 공연 준비 비용 등과 같은 막대한 비용이 발생합니다. 이렇게 비용이 높다 보니 티켓 가격도 자연스럽게 올라갈 수 밖에 없는 것이죠. 그러나 아무리 티켓 가격이 높아도 티켓 판매만으로는 이 비용들을 다 충당하기에는 역부족인데요. 해외 유명 오케스트라의 경우 티켓을 전부 판매해도 제작비의 50% 수준 정도만 커버할 수 있는 것으로 알려져 있습니다.\nG: 헉, 그럼 나머지 50%는 어떻게 커버하나요?\nK: 이런 상황에서 기업의 후원이 중요한 역할을 합니다. 기업은 공연을 후원함으로써 공연 제작사에게 상당한 재정적 지원을 제공합니다. 기업의 후원으로 공연 주최자는 높은 제작비를 충당할 수 있고, 티켓 가격을 낮출 여유가 생깁니다. 후원의 대가로 기업은 자사의 고객, 임직원, 파트너들에게 공연 관람 혜택을 제공할 수 있는 초대권을 대량으로 확보해서 마케팅 도구로 활용할 수 있고요.\nG: 아하…! 간혹 카드사에서 유명한 공연을 정가보다 훨씬 저렴한 가격에 예약할 수 있다는 혜택 알림 문자가 왔었는데, 바로 이런 경우였군요.\nK: 에디터 님도 받아본 적 있으시군요. 맞아요. 해당 카드사가 후원한 공연일 가능성이 높겠죠. 다만, 경제학적으로 바라 보면 기업의 후원이 오히려 티켓 가격을 올리는 유인으로 작용할 가능성도 존재할 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어, 공연 티켓 가격이 오르면 동일한 초대권의 금전적 가치가 상승하게 됩니다. 이는 초대권을 제공하는 기업에게는 더 높은 가치를 지닌 혜택을 제공하는 것으로 해석될 수 있습니다. 초대권은 비용을 지불하지 않고 얻는 혜택이기 때문에, 티켓 가격이 높을수록 그 혜택의 상대적 가치는 더욱 커지게 됩니다. 즉, 초대권을 받은 사람들(고객, 임직원 등)에게 더 큰 보상으로 인식될 가능성이 큰 것이죠.\n또한 공연 후원을 통해 고가의 공연 티켓을 확보할 수 있는 기업이라는 사실은 해당 기업의 브랜드 이미지를 강화하는 데 기여할 수 있습니다. 프리미엄 공연에 초대권을 제공하는 기업은 그만큼 고객이나 파트너에게 특별한 경험을 선사하는 회사로 인식되는 것이죠. 그리고 초대권의 금전적 가치 상승을 통해 기업이 후원에 지출한 금액에 대한 투자 대비 수익률(ROI)도 향상될 수도 있습니다.\nG: 그렇군요. 후원 기업 입장에서는 이왕이면 티켓 가격이 높아야 생색(?)도 낼 수 있으니 티켓 가격이 높을수록 이득이 되겠어요.\nK: 맞아요. 이를 반영하여 공연 주최측에서는 해외 유명 오케스트라의 티켓 가격을 높은 수준에서 설정할 유인이 존재하는 것입니다.\n결국, 우리가 보게 되는 해외 유명 오케스트라의 최종 티켓 가격에는 가격 차별화, 수요의 가격 탄력성, 수요와 공급의 원리, 공연 비용, 기업의 후원 등이 복합적으로 반영된 것임을 알 수 있습니다.\n이제 날씨가 많이 선선해져서 공연 보러 가기 참 좋은 계절이에요. 이번 가을에 공연을 관람할 예정이라면, 내가 구매하는 티켓의 가격에는 어떤 요소들이 반영되었는지를 한번쯤 생각해보면 좋을 것 같습니다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

ETF로는 미국, 중국, 일본, 인도는 물론, 유럽과 라틴아메리카 등 전 세계 시장에 투자할 수 있으며, 주식뿐 아니라 국채, 회사채 등 다양한 채권, 달러, 엔화 등의 통화, 리츠, 원자재에도 투자할 수 있다. 퇴직연금 계좌인 DC와 IRP에 적립한 금액으로도 거래할 수 있어서 은퇴 자금을 더욱 풍요롭게 만들기 위한 투자로도 적합하다. 오늘은 퇴직연금 계좌로 투자할 수 있는 ETF의 종류와 조건에 대해 알아보자.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n주식 대신 ETF 투자를 고려하는 이유는?\n개별 종목을 직접 고르는 주식 대신 ETF를 선택할 때는 대개 이런 점을 고려한다. 첫째, 한정된 자금으로 다양한 투자 기회를 가질 수 있다. 100만 원으로 테슬라에 투자하고 싶다면 3주를 겨우 살 수 있지만(2024년 9월 기준), S&P500 ETF에 투자하면 테슬라를 포함한 미국을 대표하는 여러 기업에 동시에 투자할 수 있다. 둘째, 저절로 분산 투자를 하게 되어 위험 관리에 유리하다. 셋째, 거래 비용이 상대적으로 저렴하다. 주식을 개별적으로 매수하는 것보다 ETF는 운용 보수가 낮아 효율적이다. 넷째, ETF는 주식처럼 실시간으로 매수와 매도가 가능해 시장 상황에 즉각적으로 대응할 수 있다. 다섯째, 투명성이 높은 편이다. ETF는 편입 종목이 공개되어 있어 투자자가 어떤 자산에 투자하는지 쉽게 확인할 수 있다.\n일반 펀드보다 ETF가 유리한 점은?\n일반적으로 증권사에서 가입하는 펀드로 알고 있는 상품은 ‘뮤추얼펀드'로, 다수의 투자자로부터 자금을 모아 주식, 채권 등 주제별 여러 자산에 투자하고 수익률에 따라 이익을 얻는다. ETF 또한 Exchange Traded Fund의 약어로, 증권거래소에서 거래가 가능한 펀드로서 기본적인 속성은 같지만 투자자로서 이용할 때는 여러 가지 차이점이 있다.\nETF는 투자자들이 펀드의 지분(share)을 직접 회사로부터 사고팔 수 없으며, 주식처럼 증권거래소에서 실시간으로 거래한다. 이에 따라 뮤추얼펀드와 달리, 거래 가격을 확인하기 위해 그날 주식시장이 마감될 때까지 기다릴 필요가 없다. 예를 들어, ETF를 통해 미국 주식시장에 투자할 경우, 지수의 가격 변화를 실시간으로 확인하며 투자 결정을 할 수 있다.\n또, ETF는 뮤추얼펀드와 비슷한 비용 구조를 가지지만, 운용 방식의 차이로 인해 일반적으로 비용이 더 저렴한 경향이 있다. 특히 최근 한국 ETF 시장에서는 대형 자산운용사들이 운용수수료를 낮추는 경쟁을 벌이며 ETF 수수료 인하 경쟁이 더욱 치열해지고 있다.\n퇴직연금으로 ETF 투자할 때, 은행보다는 증권사?\n만약 퇴직연금 계좌를 은행권에서 만들었다면, 생각보다 투자할 수 있는 ETF 상품의 선택지가 많지 않을 수 있다. 퇴직연금 사업자는 크게 은행, 증권사, 보험사로 나뉘며, 각 사업자마다 투자할 수 있는 상품의 종류와 개수가 다르다. 이 중 증권사가 ETF 상품에서는 강점을 보인다. 대표 증권사들의 경우 퇴직연금 계좌에서 투자할 수 있는 ETF가 약 700개에 이른다.\n최근에는 은행과 보험사도 ETF 상품을 점차 늘리고 있는 추세다. 이는 투자자들이 ETF에 대한 관심이 높아졌음을 반영하는 변화로 볼 수 있다. 국민은행, 우리은행, NH농협은행, 신한은행 등 대표 은행들 모두 2024년 4분기까지 퇴직연금으로 투자 가능한 10~30개 정도의 ETF를 추가해 다양한 상품 라인업을 갖출 계획이라고 밝혔다.\n퇴직연금 계좌로 투자할 수 있는 ETF 종류는?\n퇴직연금 계좌에서 투자할 수 있는 ETF에는 몇 가지 제한 조건이 있다. 첫째, 국내 증시에 상장된 ETF에만 투자할 수 있다는 점이다. 따라서 해외 증시에 상장된 ETF에는 투자할 수 없지만, 해외 주가지수를 추종하는 ETF에는 투자할 수 있다. 예를 들어, 투자자들에게 익숙한 S&P500, 나스닥, CSI 300과 같은 해외 지수를 추종하는 다양한 ETF가 이미 국내 증시에 상장되어 있기 때문이다.\n둘째, 위험성이 높은 ETF에는 투자할 수 없다. ETF에도 다양한 투자 전략이 있는데, 그중 하나가 지수의 등락 폭을 2~3배로 증폭시키는 레버리지 ETF다. 레버리지 ETF는 지수의 변동 폭을 확대해, 일반적인 지수 변화보다 더 큰 수익률 또는 손실을 제공하는 ETF이다. 예를 들어, 레버리지 ETF가 S&P 500 지수를 2배로 추종한다고 가정하면, S&P 500 지수가 1% 오를 때 레버리지 ETF는 2% 오르고, 반대로 1% 하락하면 2% 손실을 입게 된다.\n그러나 퇴직연금과 같이 장기 투자가 기본인 계좌에서는 단기 투자에 적합한 고위험성 상품은 투자 대상에서 제외된다. 지수와 반대로 움직이는 인버스 ETF도 마찬가지다. 또한, 파생상품 위험평가액 비중이 40%를 초과하는 ETF 역시 퇴직연금 계좌에서 투자할 수 없다. 대표적으로 KODEX 골드선물, TIGER 원유선물, KOSEF 미국달러선물과 같은 상품명을 가진 금, 원유, 통화 선물 관련 ETF가 이에 해당한다.\n위험도에 따라 투자할 수 있는 비중도 제한되어 있다\nETF는 주식, 채권, 원자재, 리츠 등 다양한 자산에 투자할 수 있는 상품이다. 그중에서도 국채에 투자하는 ETF는 안전자산으로 분류되어 퇴직연금 계좌에 들어 있는 적립액에서 100%까지 투자가 가능하다. 반면, 주식이나 하이일드 채권*에 투자하는 ETF는 더 높은 위험성을 고려해 투자 비중이 70%로 제한된다. 이는 퇴직연금 계좌 내에서 위험 분산과 자산 보호를 위한 규제이다. 이러한 제한 사항은 퇴직연금 계좌에서 상품을 선택할 때 확인할 수 있도록 명시되어 있어, 투자자들이 어렵지 않게 투자 한도를 확인할 수 있다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*.css-1ebvaan{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}하이일드 채권(High Yield Bond): 신용등급이 낮은 기업이 발행한 채권을 의미한다. 신용등급이 낮기 때문에 해당 채권은 높은 이자율(즉, 높은 수익률)을 제공하여 투자자들을 끌어들인다. 하지만 이와 동시에 해당 기업이 채무를 이행하지 못할 가능성이 더 크기 때문에 고위험 고수익의 특성을 지닌다.\nETF로 미국 주식에 투자해서 고수익, 고배당 가능할까?\n미국 주식시장은 코로나 팬데믹 이후에도 꾸준한 성장을 이어가며 국내 투자자들에게 매력적인 투자처로 떠올랐다. 이 같은 흐름은 ETF 시장에서도 반영되어, 미국 주식지수를 추종하는 ETF에 대한 관심이 크게 증가했다.\n그렇다면 ETF를 통해 미국 주식에 투자해 고수익과 고배당을 기대할 수 있을까? 물론 선택하는 ETF에 따라 다르며, ETF도 주식 투자와 마찬가지로 시장 상황에 따라 수익이 달라질 수 있다. 주식시장이 상승세일 때는 수익이 커질 가능성이 있지만, 시장이 하락세를 보일 경우 손실을 입을 위험도 존재한다. 따라서 투자자들은 시장 흐름을 면밀히 분석하고 신중하게 투자 결정을 내려야 한다.\n국내 시장에도 이미 미국 나스닥이나 S&P500 같은 지수를 추종하는 다양한 ETF가 상장되어 있다. 아래는 퇴직연금 계좌에서 투자 가능한 미국 주식 관련 ETF 예시다. 나스닥과 S&P500을 추종하는 ETF만 해도 20개가 넘는다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n퇴직연금을 통해 투자할 수 있는 나스닥과 S&P500 관련 ETF 예시\n수익률을 살펴보면, 지난 1년 동안 20% 이상의 수익률을 기록한 ETF 상품도 많다. 하지만 과거 수익률은 미래의 수익을 보장하지 않는다는 점을 반드시 염두에 두어야 한다. 투자 결정 시에는 과거의 성과보다는 현재 시장 상황과 전망을 고려하는 것이 중요하다.\n배당주 투자를 고려할 때, 많은 투자자들이 미국의 대표적인 배당성장 ETF인 SCHD(Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF)를 떠올린다. 현재 국내 운용사들도 미국 배당주에 투자할 수 있는 다양한 ETF를 출시하고 있어, ETF를 통해 충분히 미국 배당주에 투자할 수 있다.\n아래는 실제로 미국 배당주에 투자 가능한 ETF 리스트다. 이 목록은 참고용 예시일 뿐이며, 특정 상품을 소개하거나 권유하는 것은 아니다.\n\n퇴직연금을 통해 투자할 수 있는 배당주 관련 ETF 예시\n실제 내야 하는 ETF 수수료 확인하는 방법\n최근 삼성자산운용이 ETF 운용보수를 국내 최저 수준인 연 0.0099%까지 내렸다는 소식이 전해졌다. 그러나 이 운용보수는 투자자가 내야 하는 총수수료와는 다르다는 점에 유의해야 한다. 실제로 투자자가 부담하는 비용은 이보다 더 복잡하다. .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}금융투자협회 전자공시에서 검색해보면 최저 수수료를 적용했다고 알려진 'KODEX 미국나스닥100TR'의 총비용비율(Total Expense Ratio, TER)은 0.1055%다. 그렇다면 금융투자협회에서 확인한 삼성 KODEX 미국나스닥100 Total Return ETF에서 실제로 투자자가 부담하는 총 비용은 ‘TER(A+B)+판매수수료율(C)+매매·중개수수료율(D)’을 모두 더한 금액이다. 이 경우 투자자가 부담해야 할 총 비용은 투자액의 0.1748%가 된다.\n\nETF 수수료, 더 꼼꼼하게 따져보기\nETF 수수료는 크게 세 가지로 나뉜다. 첫째는 총보수로, 이는 운용수수료, 판매수수료, 수탁수수료, 사무관리수수료를 포함한다. 둘째는 기타비용으로, 회계감사비, 지수사용료, 예탁원 결제보수 등 실제로 투자자들이 잘 알지 못하는 비용들이 여기에 속한다. 셋째는 매매중개수수료로, 이 역시 투자자들이 쉽게 눈치채기 어려운 비용 중 하나다.\n이렇게 세 가지 항목을 모두 합해 총수수료가 산출된다. 다만, 매매중개수수료가 차지하는 비중은 상대적으로 작기 때문에, 전자공시에서 간단히 총보수와 기타비용을 합한 총비용비율(TER)만 확인해도 비교적 정확한 수수료를 추정할 수 있다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은, 김현미(아이랩) Graphic 조수희\n✱<노후 준비 액션플랜> 시리즈는 퇴직연금을 통해 투자하는 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}ETF 상품의 배분율, 수익률, 수수료를 한눈에 보기 쉽도록 전달하는 🔗아이랩 글라이드와 함께 만듭니다.",

SK하이닉스(-5.01%), 현대차(-4.13%), 기아(-4.68%) 등 다른 주요 종목도 일제히 하락하며 하방 압력을 키웠다.\n현재 밸류업지수에 포함된 100개 종목 중 기업가치 제고 계획을 공시한 기업은 7곳에 그친다. 이 중 제조업 계열은 현대차와 DB하이텍 등 두 곳뿐이다. 앞으로 지배구조, 주주환원, 수익성, 성장성 등 각 기업에 필요한 부분을 얼마나 충실하게 계획에 담느냐에 따라 밸류업지수에 대한 평가도 달라질 것으로 보인다.(중략)\n\n\nK-밸류업 지수에는 삼성전자, SK하이닉스, 현대차, 기아, 셀트리온, 신한지주 등 업계를 선도하는 대기업들이 포함되었습니다. 하지만 KB금융은 PBR이 높음에도 ROE가 낮아 제외되었고, 고배당 기업으로 알려진 SK텔레콤도 리스트에서 빠졌죠. 반면, 최근 두산로보틱스의 합병 과정에서 주주들에게 불리한 추진으로 논란이 있었던 두산밥캣은 선정되기도 했습니다.\n또 다른 지적 사항은 K-밸류업 지수에 포함된 기업 100개 중 88개가 이미 코스피 200이나 코스닥 150에 포함된 기업이라는 점입니다. 이로 인해 기존 지수와의 차별성이 부족하다는 의견도 제기되고 있어요. 선정 기준이 모호하다는 비판이 이어지면서 한국거래소는 100개 구성 종목의 연내 변경 가능성 또한 열어둔 상태고요.\nK-밸류업 지수에 포함된 기업들은 주로 배당 확대나 자사주 매입 같은 주주 친화적 정책을 펼칠 가능성이 높습니다. 실제로 이들 기업의 배당 성향은 23.9%로 코스피 200 기업들의 평균 배당 성향인 17.5%보다 높거든요.\n그러나, 지수에 포함되었다고 해서 자동으로 기업 가치나 주가가 상승하는 것은 아닙니다. 주주 친화 정책이 제대로 실행되지 않으면 큰 변화는 기대하기가 어렵고요. 더군다나 정부가 주주 친화 정책을 권장하고 있지만 규제는 하지 않겠다고 했으니, 이런 정책들이 실제로 실행될지도 미지수입니다. 예를 들어 자사주 소각 시 법인세 감면 같은 실질적인 인센티브가 없다면, 기업들이 굳이 주주 친화적 정책을 실행하지 않을 수도 있으니까요.\n하지만 K-밸류업 지수의 부족한 지점이라 지적되는 부분이 보완되고, 연말에 ETF 상품까지 출시된다면 분위기가 달라질 가능성이 상당히 높습니다. 투자자들이 보다 쉽게 K-밸류업 지수에 포함된 기업들에 접근할 수 있고, 주주 친화적 정책들이 강화되면서 장기적으로는 기업 가치와 주가 상승을 기대할 수 있을 테니까요.\n연말까지 이런 변화들이 보다 더 구체화되기를 기대하며, K-밸류업 지수가 한국 증시의 중요한 변곡점이 될 수 있을지 살펴봐도 좋겠습니다.\n\n\n코리아 디스카운트: 한국 기업들이 글로벌 시장에서 실제 가치보다 낮게 평가되는 현상. 한국 경제의 구조적 문제, 지배구조, 그리고 외부 요인들이 복합적으로 작용해 주가가 외국 경쟁사들보다 저평가되고 있는데요. 이는 한국 기업들에게 장기적으로 불리하게 작용하며, 투자 유치에 장애물이 될 수 있습니다.\n주주환원정책: 기업이 이익을 창출한 후 주주들에게 그 가치를 돌려주는 정책. 대표적으로 배당금 지급과 자사주 매입 및 소각 등의 방법 등이 있어요. 이러한 정책은 주주의 신뢰를 강화하는 데 중요한 역할을 합니다.\nROE(Return on Equity, 자기자본이익률): 기업이 자기 자본을 얼마나 효율적으로 활용하여 이익을 창출하는지를 나타내는 지표. ROE는 순이익을 자기 자본으로 나누어 산출되며, 이는 기업의 수익성 및 자본 효율성을 평가하는 데 중요한 역할을 해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
