        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re introducing Zoomer, Meta’s comprehensive, automated debugging and optimization platform for AI. \nZoomer works across all of our training and inference workloads at Meta and provides deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains in our AI infrastructure. \nZoomer has delivered training time reductions, and significant QPS improvements, making it the de-facto tool for AI performance optimization across Meta’s entire AI infrastructure.\nAt the scale that Meta’s AI infrastructure operates, poor performance debugging can lead to massive energy inefficiency, increased operational costs, and suboptimal hardware utilization across hundreds of thousands of GPUs. The fundamental challenge is achieving maximum computational efficiency while minimizing waste. Every percentage point of utilization improvement translates to significant capacity gains that can be redirected to innovation and growth.\nZoomer is Meta’s automated, one-stop-shop platform for performance profiling, debugging, analysis, and optimization of AI training and inference workloads. Since its inception, Zoomer has become the de-facto tool across Meta for GPU workload optimization, generating tens of thousands of profiling reports daily for teams across all of our apps. \nWhy Debugging Performance Matters\nOur AI infrastructure supports large-scale and advanced workloads across a global fleet of GPU clusters, continually evolving to meet the growing scale and complexity of generative AI.\nAt the training level it supports a diverse range of workloads, including powering models for ads ranking, content recommendations, and GenAI features.  \nAt the inference level, we serve hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day.\nOperating at this scale means putting a high priority on eliminating GPU underutilization. Training inefficiencies delay model iterations and product launches, while inference bottlenecks limit our ability to serve user requests at scale. Removing resource waste and accelerating workflows helps us train larger models more efficiently, serve more users, and reduce our environmental footprint.\nAI Performance Optimization Using Zoomer\nZoomer is an automated debugging and optimization platform that works across all of our AI model types (ads recommendations, GenAI, computer vision, etc.) and both training and inference paradigms, providing deep performance insights that enable energy savings, workflow acceleration, and efficiency gains.  \nZoomer’s architecture consists of three essential layers that work together to deliver comprehensive AI performance insights: \nInfrastructure and Platform Layer\nThe foundation provides the enterprise-grade scalability and reliability needed to profile workloads across Meta’s massive infrastructure. This includes distributed storage systems using Manifold (Meta’s blob storage platform) for trace data, fault-tolerant processing pipelines that handle huge trace files, and low-latency data collection with automatic profiling triggers across thousands of hosts simultaneously. The platform maintains high availability and scale through redundant processing workers and can handle huge numbers of profiling requests during peak usage periods.\nAnalytics and Insights Engine\nThe core intelligence layer delivers deep analytical capabilities through multiple specialized analyzers. This includes: GPU trace analysis via Kineto integration and NVIDIA DCGM, CPU profiling through StrobeLight integration, host-level metrics analysis via dyno telemetry, communication pattern analysis for distributed training, straggler detection across distributed ranks, memory allocation profiling (including GPU memory snooping), request/response profiling for inference workloads, and much more. The engine automatically detects performance anti-patterns and also provides actionable recommendations.\nVisualization and User Interface Layer\nThe presentation layer transforms complex performance data into intuitive, actionable insights. This includes interactive timeline visualizations showing GPU activity across thousands of ranks, multi-iteration analysis for long-running training workloads, drill-down dashboards with percentile analysis across devices, trace data visualization integrated with Perfetto for kernel-level inspection, heat map visualizations for identifying outliers across GPU deployments, and automated insight summaries that highlight critical bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.\nThe three essential layers of Zoomer’s architecture.\nHow Zoomer Profiling Works: From Trigger to Insights\nUnderstanding how Zoomer conducts a complete performance analysis provides insight into its sophisticated approach to AI workload optimization.\nProfiling Trigger Mechanisms\nZoomer operates through both automatic and on-demand profiling strategies tailored to different workload types. For training workloads, which involve multiple iterations and can run for days or weeks, Zoomer automatically triggers profiling around iteration 550-555 to capture stable-state performance while avoiding startup noise. For inference workloads, profiling can be triggered on-demand for immediate debugging or through integration with automated load testing and benchmarking systems for continuous monitoring.\nComprehensive Data Capture\nDuring each profiling session, Zoomer simultaneously collects multiple data streams to build a holistic performance picture: \nGPU Performance Metrics: SM utilization, GPU memory utilization, GPU busy time, memory bandwidth, Tensor Core utilization, power consumption, clock frequencies, and power consumption data via DCGM integration.\nDetailed Execution Traces: Kernel-level GPU operations, memory transfers, CUDA API calls, and communication collectives via PyTorch Profiler and Kineto.\nHost-Level Performance Data: CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, storage access patterns, and system-level bottlenecks via dyno telemetry.\nApplication-Level Annotations: Training iterations, forward/backward passes, optimizer steps, data loading phases, and custom user annotations.\nInference-Specific Data: Rate of inference requests, server latency, active requests, GPU memory allocation patterns, request latency breakdowns via Strobelight’s Crochet profiler, serving parameter analysis, and thrift request-level profiling.\nCommunication Analysis: NCCL collective operations, inter-node communication patterns, and network utilization for distributed workloads\nDistributed Analysis Pipeline\nRaw profiling data flows through sophisticated processing systems that deliver multiple types of automated analysis including:\nStraggler Detection: Identifies slow ranks in distributed training through comparative analysis of execution timelines and communication patterns.\nBottleneck Analysis: Automatically detects CPU-bound, GPU-bound, memory-bound, or communication-bound performance issues.\nCritical Path Analysis: Systematically identifies the longest execution paths to focus optimization efforts on highest-impact opportunities.\nAnti-Pattern Detection: Rule-based systems that identify common efficiency issues and generate specific recommendations.\nParallelism Analysis: Deep understanding of tensor, pipeline, data, and expert parallelism interactions for large-scale distributed training.\nMemory Analysis: Comprehensive analysis of GPU memory usage patterns, allocation tracking, and leak detection.\nLoad Imbalance Analysis: Detects workload distribution issues across distributed ranks and recommendations for optimization.\nMulti-Format Output Generation\nResults are presented through multiple interfaces tailored to different user needs: interactive timeline visualizations showing activity across all ranks and hosts, comprehensive metrics dashboards with drill-down capabilities and percentile analysis, trace viewers integrated with Perfetto for detailed kernel inspection, automated insights summaries highlighting key bottlenecks and recommendations, and actionable notebooks that users can clone to rerun jobs with suggested optimizations.\nSpecialized Workload Support\nFor massive distributed training for specialized workloads, like GenAI, Zoomer contains a purpose-built platform supporting LLM workloads that offers specialized capabilities including GPU efficiency heat maps and N-dimensional parallelism visualization. For inference, specialized analysis covers everything from single GPU models, soon expanding to massive distributed inference across thousands of servers.\nA Glimpse Into Advanced Zoomer Capabilities\nZoomer offers an extensive suite of advanced capabilities designed for different AI workload types and scales. While a comprehensive overview of all features would require multiple blog posts, here’s a glimpse at some of the most compelling capabilities that demonstrate Zoomer’s depth:\nTraining Powerhouse Features:\nStraggler Analysis: Helps identify ranks in distributed training jobs that are significantly slower than others, causing overall job delays due to synchronization bottlenecks. Zoomer provides information that helps diagnose root causes like sharding imbalance or hardware issues.\nCritical Path Analysis: Identification of the longest execution paths in PyTorch applications, enabling accurate performance improvement projections. \nAdvanced Trace Manipulation: Sophisticated tools for compression, filtering, combination, and segmentation of massive trace files (2GB+ per rank), enabling analysis of previously impossible-to-process large-scale training jobs\nInference Excellence Features:\nSingle-Click QPS Optimization: A workflow that identifies bottlenecks and triggers automated load tests with one click, reducing optimization time while delivering QPS improvements of +2% to +50% across different models, depending on model characteristics. \nRequest-Level Deep Dive: Integration with Crochet profiler provides Thrift request-level analysis, enabling identification of queue time bottlenecks and serving inefficiencies that traditional metrics miss.\nRealtime Memory Profiling: GPU memory allocation tracking, providing live insights into memory leaks, allocation patterns, and optimization opportunities.\nGenAI Specialized Features:\nLLM Zoomer for Scale: A purpose-built platform supporting 100k+ GPU workloads with N-dimensional parallelism visualization, GPU efficiency heat maps across thousands of devices, and specialized analysis for tensor, pipeline, data, and expert parallelism interactions.\nPost-Training Workflow Support: Enhanced capabilities for GenAI post-training tasks including SFT, DPO, and ARPG workflows with generator and trainer profiling separation.\nUniversal Intelligence Features:\nHolistic Trace Analysis (HTA): Advanced framework for diagnosing distributed training bottlenecks across communication overhead, workload imbalance, and kernel inefficiencies, with automatic load balancing recommendations.\nZoomer Actionable Recommendations Engine (Zoomer AR): Automated detection of efficiency anti-patterns with machine learning-driven recommendation systems that generate auto-fix diffs, optimization notebooks, and one-click job re-launches with suggested improvements.\nMulti-Hardware Profiling: Native support across NVIDIA GPUs, AMD MI300X, MTIA, and CPU-only workloads with consistent analysis and optimization recommendations regardless of hardware platform.\nZoomer’s Optimization Impact: From Debugging to Energy Efficiency\nPerformance debugging with Zoomer creates a cascading effect that transforms low-level optimizations into massive efficiency gains. \nThe optimization pathway flows from: identifying bottlenecks → improving key metrics → accelerating workflows → reducing resource consumption → saving energy and costs.\nZoomer’s Training Optimization Pipeline\nZoomer’s training analysis identifies bottlenecks in GPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and communication patterns. \nExample of Training Efficiency Wins: \nAlgorithmic Optimizations: We delivered power savings through systematic efficiency improvements across the training fleet, by fixing reliability issues for low efficiency jobs.\nTraining Time Reduction Success: In 2024, we observed a 75% training time reduction for Ads relevance models, leading to 78% reduction in power consumption.\nMemory Optimizations: One-line code changes for performance issues due to inefficient memory copy identified by Zoomer, delivered 20% QPS improvements with minimal engineering effort. \nInference Optimization Pipeline:\nInference debugging focuses on latency reduction, throughput optimization, and serving efficiency. Zoomer identifies opportunities in kernel execution, memory access patterns, and serving parameter tuning to maximize requests per GPU.\nInference Efficiency Wins:\nGPU and CPU Serving parameters Improvements: Automated GPU and CPU bottleneck identification and parameter tuning, leading to 10% to 45% reduction in power consumption.\nQPS Optimization: GPU trace analysis used to boost serving QPS and optimize serving capacity.\nZoomer’s GenAI and Large-Scale Impact\nFor massive distributed workloads, even small optimizations compound dramatically. 32k GPU benchmark optimizations achieved 30% speedups through broadcast issue resolution, while 64k GPU configurations delivered 25% speedups in just one day of optimization.\nThe Future of AI Performance Debugging\nAs AI workloads expand in size and complexity, Zoomer is advancing to meet new challenges focused on several innovation fronts: broadening unified performance insights across heterogeneous hardware (including MTIA and next-gen accelerators), building advanced analyzers for proactive optimization, enabling inference performance tuning through serving param optimization, and democratizing optimization with automated, intuitive tools for all engineers. As Meta’s AI infrastructure continues its rapid growth, Zoomer plays an important role in helping us innovate efficiently and sustainably. \nThe post Zoomer: Powering AI Performance at Meta’s Scale Through Intelligent Debugging and Optimization appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to share another advancement in the security of your conversations on Messenger: the launch of key transparency verification for end-to-end encrypted chats. \nThis new feature enables an additional level of assurance that only you — and the people you’re communicating with — can see or listen to what is sent, and that no one else, not even Meta, can do so.\nEnd-to-end encryption on Messenger already ensures that the content of your direct messages and calls are protected from the moment they leave your device to the moment they reach the receiver’s device. As part of our end-to-end encrypted chat platform, we believe it’s also important that anyone can verify that the public keys (used by the sender’s device for encrypting each message) belong to the intended recipients and haven’t been tampered with.\nThis launch builds upon the valuable work and experiences shared by others in the industry. WhatsApp’s implementation of key transparency in 2023 demonstrated the feasibility of this technology for large-scale encrypted messaging. We’ve extended these pioneering efforts in our Messenger implementation to deliver a robust and reliable solution with similar security properties.\nWhat Is Key Transparency?\nKey transparency provides messaging users with a verifiable and auditable record of public keys. It allows them to confirm that their conversations are indeed encrypted with the correct keys for their contacts, and that these keys haven’t been maliciously swapped by a compromised server. This means you can be more confident that your messages are only accessible to the people you intend to communicate with.\n\nYou can already check your keys for end-to-end encrypted chats on Messenger, but this can be cumbersome for people who have logged in to Messenger on multiple devices, each of which has its own key. Moreover, these keys change when new devices are added or are re-registered, which necessitates another check of the key every time this happens. \nTo address this, we’ve added a new security feature, based on key transparency, that allows users to verify these keys without having to compare them manually with their contacts. Of course, anyone who wishes to continue manually verifying their keys is free to do so.\nHow We’re Handling Messenger Keys at Scale\nOur key transparency implementation leverages the Auditable Key Directory (AKD) library, mirroring the system already in place for WhatsApp. This system allows Meta to securely distribute and verify users’ public keys. To further enhance the security of this process, we use Cloudflare’s key transparency auditor to provide an additional layer of verification, ensuring that the distribution of keys is transparent and verifiable by anyone. Cloudflare’s auditor maintains a live log of the latest entries on the Key Transparency Dashboard, for both the WhatsApp and Messenger directories.\nImplementing key transparency on the scale of Messenger presented unique engineering challenges. One significant factor was the sheer volume and frequency of key updates. Messenger indexes keys for each and every device someone has logged in on, which means that a single user often has multiple, frequently-changing keys associated with their account.\nThis increased complexity leads to a much higher frequency of key updates being sequenced into our key transparency directory. Currently, we’re observing an epoch frequency of approximately 2 minutes per publish, with hundreds of thousands of new keys added in each epoch. Since we began indexing, our database has already grown to billions of key entries. We’ve implemented a number of advancements in our infrastructure and libraries to help manage this massive and constantly growing dataset, while ensuring high availability and real-time verification:\nWe improved the algorithmic efficiency of the existing key lookup and verification operations in the AKD library by optimizing for smaller proof sizes, even as the number of updates (versions) for a single key grows. Previously, these proofs grew linearly with the height of the transparency tree, which was still difficult to manage given the number of nodes in the tree.\nWe also updated our existing infrastructure to be more resilient to temporary outages and improved the process for recovering from long delays in key sequencing. These improvements were adapted from lessons learned from running WhatsApp’s key transparency log for the past two years.\nWith key transparency now live on Messenger, users will have the ability to automatically verify the authenticity of their contacts’ encryption keys for one-on-one chats. This represents another step forward in our ongoing investment in providing a secure and private service. \nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance the security and privacy of end-to-end encryption in Messenger.\nThe post Key Transparency Comes to Messenger appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve released Ax 1.0, an open-source platform that uses machine learning to automatically guide complex, resource-intensive experimentation.\nAx is used at scale across Meta to improve AI models, tune production infrastructure, and accelerate advances in ML and even hardware design.\nOur accompanying paper, “Ax: A Platform for Adaptive Experimentation” explains Ax’s architecture, methodology, and how it compares to other state-of-the-art black-box optimization libraries.\nHow can researchers effectively understand and optimize AI models or systems that have a vast number of possible configurations? This is a challenge that is particularly prevalent in domains characterized by complex, interacting systems, such as modern AI development and deployment. Optimizing under these settings demands experimentation, and efficiency is of the utmost importance when evaluating a single configuration is extremely resource- and/or time-intensive.\nAdaptive experimentation offers a solution to this problem by actively proposing new configurations for sequential evaluation, leveraging insights gained from previous evaluations\nThis year, we released version 1.0 of Ax, an open source adaptive experimentation platform that leverages machine learning to guide and automate the experimentation process. Ax employs Bayesian optimization to enable researchers and developers to conduct efficient experiments, identifying optimal configurations to optimize their systems and processes.\nIn conjunction with this major release, we published a paper titled, “Ax: A Platform for Adaptive Experimentation” that explores Ax’s core architecture, provides a deeper explanation of the methodology powering the optimization, and compares Ax’s performance against other black-box optimization libraries.\nAx has been successfully applied across various disciplines at Meta, including:\nTraditional machine learning tasks, such as hyperparameter optimization and architecture search.\nAddressing key challenges in GenAI, including discovering optimal data mixtures for training AI models.\nTuning infrastructure or compiler flags in production settings.\nOptimizing design parameters in physical engineering tasks, such as designing AR/VR devices.\nBy utilizing Ax, developers can employ state-of-the-art methodology to conduct complex experiments, ultimately gaining a deeper understanding and optimizing their underlying systems.\nHow to Get Started With Ax\nTo start using Ax to efficiently tune parameters in complex systems install the latest version of the library via `pip install ax-platform` and visit the Ax website for a quickstart guide, tutorials, and deep dives on the methods that Ax uses under the hood.\nAx Is for Real World Experimentation\nAdaptive experiments are incredibly useful, but can be challenging to run. Not only do these experiments require the use of sophisticated machine learning methods to drive the optimization, they also demand specialized infrastructure for managing experiment state, automating orchestration, providing useful analysis and diagnostics, and more. Additionally, the goals of any given experiment are often more complex than simply improving a single metric. In practice experimentation is usually a careful balance between multiple objective metrics subject to multiple constraints and guardrails.\nWe built Ax to empower users to easily configure and run these dynamic experiments using state-of-the-art techniques, and to provide a robust and mature platform for researchers to integrate cutting-edge methods directly into production systems.\nAx for Understanding\nIn addition to finding optimal configurations efficiently, Ax is a powerful tool for understanding the underlying system being optimized. Ax provides a suite of analyses (plots, tables, etc) which helps its users understand how the optimization is progressing over time, tradeoffs between different metrics via a Pareto frontier, visualize the effect of one or two parameters across the input space, and explain how much each input parameter contributes to the results (via sensitivity analysis). \nThese tools allow experimenters to walk away with both an optimal configuration to deploy to production and a deeper understanding of their system, which can inform decisions moving forward.\n   \nHow Ax Works\nBy default Ax uses Bayesian optimization, an effective adaptive experimentation method that excels at balancing exploration – learning how new configurations  perform, and exploitation – refining configurations previously observed to be good. Ax relies on BoTorch for its implementation of Bayesian optimization components.\n\nBayesian optimization is an iterative approach to solving the global optimization problem  which does not assume any information about the form of the function f. In practice, this means optimizing systems by evaluating some candidate configurations  (i.e., trying some configurations out and measuring their effect), building a surrogate model using this data, using that surrogate to identify the most promising configuration to evaluate next, and repeating until an optimal solution has been found or the experimental budget is exhausted.\nUnder typical settings Ax uses a Gaussian process (GP) as the  surrogate model during the Bayesian optimization loop, a flexible model which can make predictions while quantifying uncertainty and is especially effective with very few data points. Ax then uses an acquisition function from a family called expected improvement (EI) to suggest the next candidate configurations to evaluate by capturing the expected value of any new configuration compared to the best previously evaluated configuration.\nThe following animation shows this loop with a GP modeling the goal metric plotted above in blue and EI plotted below in black; the highest value of EI informs the next value of x to evaluate. Once the new value of x has been evaluated, the GP is re-fit with the new data point and we calculate the next EI value.\n\nThis 1-dimensional example can be expanded for many input and output dimensions, allowing Ax to optimize problems with many (potentially hundreds) of tunable parameters and outcomes. In fact, higher-dimensional settings, in which covering the search space becomes exponentially more costly, is where the surrogate-based approach really shines compared to other approaches.\nYou can read more about Bayesian optimization on Ax website’s Introduction to Bayesian Optimization page.\nHow We Use Ax at Meta\nAx has been deployed at scale at Meta to solve some of the company’s most challenging optimization problems. Thousands of developers at Meta use Ax for tasks like hyperparameter optimization and architecture search for AI models, tuning parameters for online recommender and ranking models, infrastructure optimizations, and simulation optimization for AR and VR hardware design.\nThese experiments optimize nuanced goals and leverage sophisticated algorithms. For instance, we’ve used multi-objective optimization to simultaneously improve a machine learning model’s accuracy while minimizing its resource usage. When researchers were tasked with shrinking natural language models to fit on the first generation of  Ray-Ban Stories they used Ax to search for models that optimally traded off size and performance. Additionally, Meta engineers use constrained optimization techniques for tuning recommender systems to optimize key metrics while avoiding regressions in others.\nRecently, Ax was used to design new faster curing, low carbon concrete mixes that were deployed at one of our data center construction sites. These new mixes are playing an important role in advancing our goal of net zero emissions in 2030.\nWe see problems across every domain where the ultimate quality of a system is affected by parameters whose interactions are complex to reason about without experimentation and where experimentation has a meaningful cost: Ax addresses these challenges by employing a data-driven approach to adapt experiments as they unfold, enabling us to solve these problems efficiently and effectively.\nThe Future of Ax\nWe are always working to improve Ax by building new features for representing innovative experiment designs, exciting new optimization methods, or integrations for using Ax with external platforms.

This project is the result of years of collaboration, innovation, and a shared vision to connect communities, accelerate economic growth, and enable transformative digital experiences across Africa and beyond.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2Africa_Impact_Captions_1920x1080_Stereo_MPEG-4-1.mp4\n \nUnprecedented Scale and Reach\n2Africa is the first cable to connect East and West Africa in a continuous system and link Africa to the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. With a current reach of 33 countries and still counting, we’re enabling connectivity for 3 billion people across Africa, Europe, and Asia – more than 30% of the world’s population. This scale is unprecedented and we are proud to have partnered with stakeholders across the ecosystem to deliver new levels of connectivity at such scale.\nThe 2Africa Subsea Cable reaches 3 continents and lands in 33 countries, connecting over 3 billion people.\nBuilding 2Africa: Partnership, Scale, and Open Access\nAfrica’s digital future depends on robust, scalable infrastructure built in partnership with local communities and stakeholders. As demand for high-speed internet grows, a consortium of global partners led by Meta, including Bayobab (MTN Group), center3 (stc), CMI, Orange, Telecom Egypt, Vodafone Group, and WIOCC, came together to design and invest in what would become the world’s longest open access subsea cable system. With the Pearls extension scheduled to go live in 2026, 2Africa’s complete system length of 45,000 kilometers is longer than the equivalent of the Earth’s circumference. \nRealizing this vision required close collaboration across both private and public sectors. We managed the project and facilitated engagement with local partners for cable landing, construction, and regulatory processes. The deployment spanned 50 jurisdictions and nearly six years of work, relying on the active engagement of regulators and policymakers to navigate requirements and keep progress on track.\nThe consortium’s shared goal is to develop an open, inclusive network that fosters competition, supports innovation, and unlocks new opportunities for millions. This open-access model ensures that multiple service providers can leverage the infrastructure, accelerating digital transformation and AI adoption across the region. New partners including Bharti Airtel and MainOne (an Equinix Company) collaborated on specific segments and data center integration, further expanding the cable’s impact and reach.\nEngineering Innovation and Overcoming Challenges\nBuilding 2Africa required us to push the boundaries of what’s possible in subsea infrastructure. We deployed advanced spatial division multiplexing (SDM) technology, supporting up to 16 fiber pairs per cable. This is double the capacity of older systems. It is the first 16-fiber-pair subsea cable to fully connect Africa. We incorporated undersea optical wavelength switching, enabling flexible bandwidth management and supporting evolving demands for AI, cloud, and high-bandwidth applications.\n\nWe increased 2Africa’s burial depth by 50% over previous systems and carefully routed the cable to avoid seabed hazards such as seamounts at hot brine pools, improving resilience and network availability. The system features two independent trunk powering architectures across its West, East, and Mediterranean segments, optimizing capacity and providing additional resiliency against electrical faults. Our branching unit switching capability allowed us to optimize for trunk capacity and reliability by utilizing routes much further offshore from hazards such as the Congo Canyon turbidity currents, while efficiently serving branches to West African nations. To further ensure the integrity and reach of the cable, we engineered compatible crossing solutions for over 60 oil and gas pipelines. \n\nOver the course of construction, we deployed 35 offshore vessels, amounting to nearly 32 years of vessel operations, while dedicated shore-end operations required even more inshore vessels, locally mobilized for cable pulling, guarding, security, and dive support. In remote locations, we imported and mobilized specialist equipment such as dive decompression chambers and shore-end burial tooling to locally operated vessels.\nEconomic Impact and Community Transformation\n2Africa is delivering a step change in international bandwidth for Africa, with technical capacity that far exceeds previous systems. For example, on the West segment, stretching from England to South Africa, and landing in countries such as Senegal, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Gabon, the Republic of Congo, DRC, and Angola, the cable supports 21 terabits per second (Tbps) per fiber pair, with 8 fiber pairs on the trunk. This results in a total trunk capacity of up to 180 Tbps. \nBut what does 180 Tbps mean for people?\nTo put in perspective:\n180 Tbps is enough to stream over 36 million HD movies simultaneously (assuming 5 megabits per second (Mbps) per stream).\nFor an individual, this means the potential to download 15,000 full-length Nollywood films (each about 1.5 GB) per second, or enable students to access a remote university’s full library in a minute.\nFor a city like Lagos, it means millions of people can video call, stream, and work online at the same time – without experiencing slowdowns or congestion.\nThis massive capacity ensures a near-limitless supply of international internet bandwidth, allowing internet service providers (ISPs) and mobile network operators (MNOs) to secure capacity at much lower wholesale prices. This creates market competition, redundancy, and supports modern digital infrastructure including cloud services, data centers, and 5G deployment. \nThe impact is profound: 2Africa is expected to contribute up to 36.9 billion US dollars to Africa’s GDP within just the first two to three years of operation. The cable’s arrival will boost job creation, entrepreneurship, and innovation hubs in connected regions. Evidence from previous cable landings shows that fast internet access increases employment rates, improves productivity, and supports shifts toward higher-skill occupations. \nMeta’s vision is to empower African entrepreneurs, creators, and businesses to innovate and collaborate. By partnering with policymakers, regulators, and stakeholders, we advance Africa’s digital transformation and support its position as an emerging major player in the global digital economy.\nBuilding Connections, Empowering Progress\nThe completion of 2Africa is a defining moment for Africa’s digital future. By leading the design, funding, and deployment of the world’s longest subsea cable system to date, we are building the infrastructure that will power transformative new experiences, drive economic growth, and connect billions of people. We are laying the foundation for the next generation of digital experiences. This subsea cable will enable faster, more reliable internet and support AI-driven services through digital access.\n2Africa is part of Meta’s mission to build the future of human connection, opening more pathways for communities across Africa to help shape and play a critical role in the next chapter of the global digital economy. \nThe post Announcing the Completion of the Core 2Africa System: Building the Future of Connectivity Together appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how we’ve enabled Dolby Vision and ambient viewing environment (amve) on the Instagram iOS app to enhance the video viewing experience.\nHDR videos created on iPhones contain unique Dolby Vision and amve metadata that we needed to support end-to-end\nInstagram for iOS is now the first Meta app to support Dolby Vision video, with more support coming across all of Meta’s apps coming in the future.\nEvery iPhone-produced HDR video encoding includes two additional pieces of metadata that help ensure the picture is consistent between different displays and viewing conditions:\nAmbient viewing environment (amve), which provides the characteristics of the nominal ambient viewing environment for displaying associated video content. This information enables the final device to adjust the rendering of the video if the actual ambient viewing conditions differ from those for which it was encoded.\nDolby Vision, which enhances color, brightness, and contrast to better match the video to the capabilities of the display.\nWhile the Instagram and Facebook iOS apps have supported high dynamic range (HDR) video since 2022, our initial rollout of HDR didn’t support Dolby Vision or amve delivery and playback. Our derived encodings were done with FFmpeg, which has traditionally lacked support for Dolby Vision and amve. Since our tooling was discarding this metadata, it meant that pictures were not entirely representative of the way they were meant to be viewed – something that was particularly noticeable at low screen brightness levels.\nNow, after hearing feedback from people using our iOS apps, we’ve worked with our partners to preserve the iOS-produced amve and Dolby Vision metadata from end-to-end and significantly enhanced the HDR viewing experience on iOS devices.  \nHow Meta Processes Video \nIt may first be helpful to give some background on the lifecycle of a video at Meta. \nThe majority of videos uploaded through our apps go through three main stages:\n1. Client Processing \nIn the client processing stage, the creator’s device flattens their composition into a single video file at a size appropriate for upload. For HDR videos produced by iOS devices this means encoding with HEVC using the Main 10 profile. This is the stage in which amve and Dolby Vision metadata are produced, added to the encoded bitstream, and uploaded to Meta’s servers.\n2.  Server Processing\nIn the server processing stage, our transcoding system generates different versions of the video for different consumers. As playback occurs across a variety of devices with different capabilities, we need to produce the video in a format which will be optimal for each device. In the scope of HDR uploads, this means producing an SDR version for devices that don’t support HDR, a VP9 version to satisfy the majority of players, and (for our most popular videos) an AV1 version with the highest quality at the lowest file size.\nEach of these versions is produced at a different bitrate (essentially, file size) to ensure that consumers with varying network conditions are all able to play the video without waiting for a large download to complete (the tradeoff is that lower bitrates have lower quality). All of our derived encodings are created with FFmpeg, which historically lacked support for amve and Dolby Vision. This is the stage where metadata was getting dropped.\n3. Consumption\nIn the consumption stage, the viewer’s device picks the version that will play back smoothly (without stalls), decodes it frame by frame, and draws each frame onto the screen. In the context of iOS, all HDR playback is done using Apple’s AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer (AVSBDL). This is the class that consumes amve and Dolby Vision metadata along with each decoded frame.\nHow We Added Support for amve\nWhen we first set off to support amve in 2022, we noticed something interesting. As we operate on a decoupled architecture of lower-level components rather than a typical high-level AVPlayer setup, we were able to inspect an intact video encoding and get a look at the amve metadata in between the decoder and AVSBDL. We observed that every frame of every video seemed to have exactly the same metadata. This allowed us to hold ourselves over with a quick fix and hardcode these values directly into our player pipeline.\nThis was not a great situation to be in. Even though the value seemed to be static, there was nothing enforcing this. Maybe a new iPhone or iOS version would produce different values, then we’d be using the wrong ones. amve is also not a concept on Android, which would mean that viewing an Android-produced HDR encoding on iPhone would result in an image that was not technically accurate.\nIn 2024, we worked with the community to land amve support in FFmpeg. We also built in some logging, which showed that our two-year-old assertion that the values never change still stood. But if they ever do, we will be properly set up for it. \nEnabling Dolby Vision\nDolby Vision was not as straightforward as amve to adopt.\nChallenge #1: The extant specification was for carriage of metadata within an HEVC bitstream. We don’t deliver HEVC.\niPhone-produced HDR uses Dolby Vision profile 8.4, where 8 indicates a profile using HEVC (the video codec) and .4 means cross-compatible with HLG (the standard for HDR video that players without Dolby Vision support would adhere to). \nIn order to deliver Dolby Vision metadata we needed to carry it within a codec that we do deliver. Fortunately, Dolby has created Profile 10 for carriage of Dolby Vision within AV1. As VP9 does not offer a facility for carriage of additional metadata there is no support for Dolby Vision at this time, but we are interested in exploring alternate delivery mechanisms.\nHowever, Dolby Vision Profiles 10 and 8 were not properly supported by our existing video processing tools, including FFmpeg and Shaka packager. Based on the specifications from Dolby, we collaborated with the FFmpeg developers to fully implement support for Dolby Vision Profile 8 and Profile 10. In particular, we enabled support within FFmpeg to transcode HEVC with Profile 8.4 into AV1 with Profile 10.4 using both the libaom and libsvtav1 encoders, and made fixes to other parts of the stack, including dav1d decoder and Shaka packager, to properly support Dolby Vision metadata.\nChallenge #2: Getting Dolby Vision into AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer\nWhen you feed AVSBDL an encoded bitstream in a supported format, e.g., HEVC from an iPhone camera, Dolby Vision just works for free. But we feed buffers that we decode independently, as we need to be able to decode formats that Apple does not offer out of the box (AV1 on devices before the iPhone 15 Pro, for example). Given this setup, it’s only fair that we’d have to extract Dolby Vision independently as well.\nFollowing the newly-minted specification for carriage of Profile 10 within an AV1 bitstream from Dolby, we implemented manual extraction of Dolby Vision metadata, packaged it into the same format that AVSBDL expected, and we were in business.\nTo prove that our setup was working as expected, we set up a series of identical Instagram posts with and without Dolby Vision metadata. Our partners at Dolby measured the brightness of each of these posts using a display color analyzer, at varying levels of screen brightness.\nThey captured the following:\nScreen brightness settings versus image brightness, with and without Dolby Vision.\nIn this chart, the X-axis represents the screen brightness setting and the Y-axis represents the observed image brightness. The results demonstrate that with Dolby Vision metadata present, the brightness of the content much more closely follows the brightness setting of the screen.\nIt worked!…But we were not done yet. \nTesting Our Dolby Vision Implementation\nAt Meta, we A/B test new features before shipping them to ensure they are performing as we expect. How do we A/B test metadata embedded within a video bitstream? The answer is that we produced an additional version of every video containing the new metadata. We delivered this new version to a randomly distributed test population while the randomly distributed control population continued receiving the existing experience. At our scale, we can assert that roughly an equal population will watch both flavors of each video.\nFor each flavor, we collected statistics such as how long the video was watched, how long it took to load, what type of connection it was watched on, and whether any errors were encountered during playback. Then we analyzed in aggregate to see how the flavor with metadata compared to the flavor without.\nWe hypothesized that if the metadata works as expected, videos with the new metadata would receive more watch time. But when we ran our initial test on Instagram Reels in 2024 we found that, on average, videos with Dolby Vision metadata were actually watched less than their standard counterparts.\nHow could this be possible? Isn’t Dolby Vision supposed to improve the image?\nOur First A/B Test With Dolby Vision Metadata \nOur data indicated that people were watching less Dolby Vision video because the videos were taking too long to load and people were just moving on to the next Reel in their feed.\nThere was a reasonable cause for the longer load times: The new metadata added on the order of 100 kbps to every video on average. It sounds petty, but our encodings are highly optimized for all kinds of diverse viewing conditions. Every bit counts in some situations, and a 100-kbps overhead was enough to regress engagement at the margins.\nThe answer to this was a compressed metadata format. The team at Dolby offered another specification which would lower the metadata overhead by a factor of four, to 25 kbps on average.\nWould it be enough? We had to run another test to find out. But there was more work to be done first.\nWe needed to implement support for Dolby Vision metadata compression (and decompression while we’re at it) in FFmpeg using a bitstream filter. Also, while the uncompressed format was something we could extract from the bitstream and hand off to Apple, the compressed format was not something that was supported by Apple out of the box. We had to implement client-side decompression on our own.\nAbout 2000 lines of code later, we were ready.\nOur Successful A/B Test \nThis time, we found that consumers viewing with Dolby Vision metadata were spending more time in the app. We attribute this to people spending more time watching HDR videos in lower-light environments, when their screens are set to lower brightness levels and the HDR videos with proper metadata are less taxing on the eyes.\nBecause including Dolby Vision metadata had a tangibly positive outcome, we were able to make the case for shipping it across Instagram for iOS, making it our first app to take advantage of Dolby Vision. As of June 2025, all of our delivered AV1 encodings derived from iPhone-produced HDR include Dolby Vision metadata.\nThe Future of Dolby Vision Across Meta\nThe final challenge in the scope of this post is that Dolby Vision is not widely supported within the web ecosystem across different browsers and displays. Thus, we cannot accurately show the difference that it makes on this page, and hope you will experience it on Instagram on iPhone for yourself. The support for Dolby vision and amve is now in our encoding recipes and as such it’s ready for deployment to other platforms as well as we’re currently working on extending the support to Facebook Reels.\nIn collaboration with Dolby, we’ve solved the perceptible problem of HDR metadata preservation and collaborated with the FFmpeg developers to implement its support and make it readily available to the  community to take advantage of.\nThis is just the beginning. We look forward to expanding Dolby Vision to other Meta apps and their corresponding operating systems.\nAcknowledgements\nWe’d like to thank Haixia Shi, the team at Dolby, and Niklas Haas from FFmpeg for their work supporting this effort.\nThe post Enhancing HDR on Instagram for iOS With Dolby Vision appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/11/spring-boot-4/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 20:11:35 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring Boot 4.0 has officially landed. At JetBrains, we’ve been tracking the updates since the first milestones to ensure that IntelliJ IDEA delivers a smooth and reliable development experience.\nWhile many of the core capabilities come directly from Spring Framework 7, Spring Boot remains the adoption enabler that brings everything together: sensible defaults, consistent configuration, unified starters, and the familiar lightning-fast productivity when creating applications.\nAs the most popular framework in the Java world, Spring Boot also helps developers move from older JDK versions to newer ones that offer better performance, more efficient garbage collectors, and modern language features.\nThis major Spring Boot release introduces cleaner modularization to reduce memory usage, improved observability with Micrometer, JSpecify as the standard null-safety library, and many other small improvements that streamline daily development.\nFor JetBrains, the biggest news in Spring Boot 4 is that Kotlin 2.2 is now the official baseline version for the framework. This milestone is the result of a long-standing collaboration between the JetBrains Kotlin team and the Spring Framework team.\nLet’s take a closer look at Spring Boot 4’s new features through the lens of Kotlin 2.2. \nNullability\nThe Kotlin compiler and IntelliJ IDEA now support JSpecify annotations natively. You will receive a compiler warning if you use JSpecify-annotated Java code incorrectly. In addition, IntelliJ IDEA will warn you if you try to assign a Java variable annotated with @Nullable to a non-nullable variable in Kotlin, and vice versa. \nFor example, for the Java interface:\n@NullMarked\n\npublic interface QuoteProvider {\n\n    Quote findQuote(String text);\n\n}\nA Kotlin implementation must return a non-nullable Quote object from the overridden findQuote() method:\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll see the following error message:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA detects the issue and suggests changing the return type to non-nullable. JSpecify is now the default library for nullability checks across all Spring projects. This means that when you create a Spring Boot 4 project in Kotlin, you can be sure that the framework types that you use are null-aware. \nAPI versioning\nAPI versioning in Kotlin works much the same way as in Java. Thanks to Spring’s well-designed API versioning mechanism, adding a version takes only a few lines of configuration and a single annotation attribute. In Kotlin, the versioned API looks just as straightforward:\n@RestController\n\n@RequestMapping(\"/api\", produces = [MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE])\n\nclass QuoteController(private val klient: QuoteKlient) {\n\n    @GetMapping(\"quote\", version = \"1.0\")\n\n    fun fetchRandomQuote(): ResponseEntity<Quote> = \nResponseEntity.ok(klient.fetchRandomQuote())\n\n    @GetMapping(\"quote\", version = \"2.0\")\n\n    fun fetchRandomQuotes(): ResponseEntity<List<Quote>> = \nResponseEntity.ok(klient.fetchRandomQuotes())\n\n}\nThere’s nothing fancy here, just the usual Kotlin conciseness, with IntelliJ IDEA inspections helping you configure and validate version formats. \nBean registration\nBean registration is one of the areas where Kotlin truly shines. Thanks to its expressiveness and extensibility, it provides a powerful DSL for registering beans dynamically when the regular @ConditionalOn… annotation family is insufficient.\nFor example, instead of the following Java code:\npublic class QuoteProviderRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderDb\", QuoteProviderDb.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderFallback\",\n\n                QuoteProviderFallback.class,\n\n                spec -> {\n\n                    spec.fallback();\n\n                    spec.order(1);\n\n                }\n\n        );\n\n    }\n\n}\nYou can write a more elegant version without all the .class calls and lambda boilerplate:\nclass KuoteProviderRegistrar : BeanRegistrarDsl({\n\n    registerBean<QuoteProviderDb>(\"quoteProviderDb\")\n\n    registerBean<QuoteProviderFallback>(\n\n        name = \"quoteProviderFallback\",\n\n        fallback = true,\n\n        order = 1\n\n    )\n\n})\nMuch cleaner, right? \nConclusion\nSpring Boot is the most popular framework for Java development – and for good reason. With Spring Boot 4 establishing Kotlin 2.2 as the baseline and offering first-class support, we expect to see even broader Kotlin adoption among backend developers who want to use the latest language features. \nYou can try Spring Boot 4 in the 2025.3 Beta release or wait for the stable version, which is expected in early December.\nAt JetBrains, we continue to work closely with the Spring Framework team to ensure Kotlin remains well-integrated and fully supported in the Spring ecosystem.",

From day one, it powers AI Chat and Junie, our coding agent, giving you smarter reasoning, stronger instruction following, and seamless integration into your workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s new\nGemini 3 Pro shows clear improvements that matter in day-to-day development:\nUnderstands your codebase and adapts to your style. Gemini 3 Pro learns from your code to replicate your project’s conventions, so changes feel native to your repository and pass review with fewer edits.\nFollows instructions precisely. Built to reason across text, code, and visuals, Gemini 3 Pro understands complex prompts and long documents and delivers more accurate results.\nExcels at frontend development. Gemini 3 Pro shows major progress in multimodal frontend generation and complex UI work.\nOverall, it’s strong at planning and executing multi-step tasks, handling complex instructions, and reasoning across multiple contexts – helping you move from idea to production-ready code faster.\nSee Gemini 3 Pro and Junie in action\nTo demonstrate how Gemini 3 Pro and Junie handle real creative workflows, we built a full landing page experience starting from nothing but a sketch. We uploaded the sketch, provided a detailed prompt, and let Gemini 3 Pro interpret the structure, layout, and visual hierarchy.\nUsing these instructions, Junie, our coding agent, generated the first functional version of the landing page. The output included a clean layout, responsive sections, and components directly inferred from the sketch.\nNext, we asked Gemini 3 Pro and Junie to refine the page and “make it fancy”, transforming the rough structure into a polished, interactive design inspired by modern AI product websites like Adaline.ai. The agent applied animations, smooth transitions, and an elevated visual style while keeping the original structure intact. This clearly shows Gemini 3 Pro’s strong multimodal understanding and Junie’s ability to turn raw ideas into production-ready interfaces. See the result below:\n\n\n\n\nHow to try Gemini 3 Pro in your IDE\nTo access Gemini 3 Pro, you’ll need an active JetBrains AI subscription. If you don’t have one, you can start a free trial directly from your IDE – open the JetBrains AI widget in your IDE, start the installation, and follow the on-screen instructions. Once activated, you can try it in:\nAI Chat: Simply start a new chat – the model is set to Auto.\nJunie: Open Junie’s settings (Settings | Junie | Models) and choose Gemini 3 Pro. (Make sure you have the latest version of the Junie plugin installed.)\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try and let us know what you think in the comments!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting today, you can download the second EAP release for MPS 2025.3 and try all the latest updates.\nDOWNLOAD MPS 2025.3 EAP 2\nThis release includes several noteworthy improvements:\nJavaDoc language overhaul\nThe JavaDoc language has been completely migrated to use the jetbrains.mps.lang.text language for text representation and editing. This change should have minimal impact on the overall user experience. However, it fixes numerous problems:\nThe editing experience is now consistent with other MPS languages that use jetbrains.mps.lang.text, such as BaseLanguage comments or structure language documentation. Find more information about editing text on the documentation facet page.\nText can be copied and pasted between JavaDoc, BaseLanguage comments, language documentation comments, and other places where jetbrains.mps.lang.text is used. Copy/pasting a piece of plain text also works.\nText can now include styling like bold or italics. This styling gets generated as HTML tags in the resulting Java source files.\nAlong the way, several problems associated with the JavaDoc language have been resolved:\nThe description for block tags was changed to use jetbrains.mps.lang.text instead of string properties, so the same edit/copy/paste/style functionality is available inside block tags.\nBlock tags now support multiple lines of description.\nBoth block tags and inline tags are now correctly parsed from Java sources.\nA new {@literal …} inline tag was added as mandated by the Java language specification.\nCode inside CodeSnippet correctly resolves local variables.\nNodeWrapper correctly textgens the contained nodes.\n\nPaste as JavaDoc action available in BaseLanguage\nIn addition to the existing Paste as Java Statement and Paste as Class Content actions, the redesigned JavaDoc language supports a new action that enables easy pasting of textual JavaDoc code into BaseLanguage. Most importantly, this new action ensures that your JavaDoc code is properly parsed into JavaDoc text lines, block tags, and inline tags, including potential reference resolutions (e.g. for the @param or {@link } tags).\n\nThis new Paste as JavaDoc action parses the text from the clipboard and pastes it into a JavaDoc comment at the current position of the cursor. If the cursor is not positioned within an existing JavaDoc comment, the action attaches the parsed JavaDoc elements to the following field/method/class definition’s JavaDoc, creating a new JavaDoc file for them, if needed.\n\nContributions to generator plans\nWe’ve made some major improvements to generator plans, enhancing the user’s experience with complex model transformations. A new notion of PlanContribution supersedes and completely replaces the experimental fork as functionality that we introduced back in 2024.1.\ntargetFacet (see jetbrains.mps.generator.extensions.common model), which tells <mps.make> which GenerationTargetFacet/ModuleFacet to consult when determining an appropriate output location for a model.\n\nConditional forks with generator plans\nBoth the fork step and a PlanContribution in a generator plan support conditional activation. It’s now possible to activate certain branches of a plan only when certain criteria are met. At the moment, MPS comes with a conditional statement that checks the values of specified plan parameters. We intend to eventually extend statements to support logical operations (and/or), as well as other potential operations, while maintaining a strict interpretation of generator plans (i.e. no BaseLanguage code in plans).\nParameterDeclaration classes. Values for these parameters can be contributed using a PlanParameterContributor extension point. MPS comes with a few predefined parameters that are usable straight out of the box – see the jetbrains.mps.generator.extensions.common model for full details of these.\n\nUsing keyboard shortcuts in the Project view\nThe process of creating new elements in the Logical pane of the Project view using keyboard shortcuts has been significantly improved. New modules, models, and nodes can now be introduced without the use of a mouse.\nYou can also check out the blog post announcing the previous 2025.3 EAP 1 version to find out more about the improvements brought to you by that release.\nYou can find the full list of issues we’ve fixed here.\nYour JetBrains MPS team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the fourth post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nAll parts in the series:\nGetting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nEvaluating Kotlin in Real Projects\nGrowing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company\nPersuading Management: Building the Business Case for Kotlin\nOnce you have achieved a critical mass of Kotlin supporters, presenting a compelling business case to management requires moving beyond code demonstrations to hard data and strategic considerations.\nMarket momentum and industry validation\nKotlin has demonstrated remarkable growth, with 2.5 million developers worldwide now using the language. This represents sustained adoption since Google’s pivotal 2017 announcement declaring Kotlin the official language for Android development, followed by Spring Boot’s embrace of Kotlin as a first-class citizen.\nSource: Keynote KotlinConf 2025\nThe momentum has accelerated significantly. Spring Boot, which commands approximately 90% of the backend market share, formalized a strategic partnership with JetBrains in 2025 – a clear signal of Kotlin’s enterprise viability and long-term trajectory.\nFraming the strategic decision\nWhile these adoption metrics demonstrate Kotlin’s market validation, management decisions require a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis. Technology adoption at scale involves significant investments in training, tooling, and potential migration efforts. The key is presenting both the tangible benefits and realistic implementation costs, allowing leadership to make an informed strategic decision rather than a purely technical one.\nThe business gains unlocked by embracing Kotlin\nThese are the business gains when choosing Kotlin:\n\nAdvantageDetailsBusiness/Team impact\n~30% less code. Better code clarity.~30% less to write, read, fix, and maintain.➜ Increased productivity.\n➜ Improved maintainability.\n25% fewer bugs thanks to safety featuresKotlin reduces defects out of the box – no extra skills required – through features like null safety, safe APIs, and sensible defaults.➜ Better quality – happier customers and developers.\n➜ More time for new features.\n➜ Faster time-to-market.\nInvest in just one new language: KotlinKeep existing frameworks (e.g. SpringBoot, Micronaut, Quarkus).➜ Framework knowledge is preserved.\nBetter choice for AIKotlin is more AI-friendly due to noise reduction, clarity, fluency, and more, which aligns with how LLMs process code.➜ Better productivity with AI, which is increasingly influencing coding.\nFully interoperable with JavaKotlin is fully interoperable with Java; no rewrite of libraries required.➜ Investments based on Java are preserved.\nWell supportedBacked by strong players: JetBrains, Google, and Meta.➜ Future-proof choice.\nGradual adoptionKotlin supports incremental migration paths.➜ No “Big Bang” needed.\nIncrease in developer happinessIn surveys and studies, Kotlin developers consistently report better developer experience and higher job satisfaction.➜ Attract new developers.\n➜ Better retention 😃😃😃.\nFaster audit, safer complianceKotlin’s type safety, immutability, and clear data structures make systems easier to trace, validate, and certify. These qualities support transparent and reliable software processes across regulated domains. For a real-world example, see Kotlin in Payment Gateways and Fintech: A Strategic Fit for 2026 Architectures.➜ Easier internal and external audits.  \n➜ Lower compliance effort and risk. \n➜ Greater organizational transparency.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome words on developer happiness\nLooking at my career, I was greatly rewarded for letting go of my attachment to the seemingly safe career choice of Java. Daily, I’m empowered with a language that is a joy to work with and helps me express what I want to achieve in the best possible way, concisely, safely, and productively. \nIt’s a fact that, personally, I’ve become a happier developer (human ;-)?) using Kotlin. Though this is subjective, developer satisfaction data tells the same unmistakable story:\nBackend developers who migrate from Java to Kotlin report dramatically higher happiness levels across every major industry survey. \nStack Overflow’s Developer Survey data shows Kotlin consistently ranking among the top five most loved languages at ~63% satisfaction, significantly outpacing Java’s ~54% rating.\nThe Mercedes-Benz.io backend team documented “significantly more concise code than Java, reducing boilerplate and improving readability” while achieving measurable productivity gains in their microservices architecture.\nTyler Russell, a backend developer with 15 years of Java experience, reports after four years with Kotlin: “I really like Kotlin… it feels like it enables productivity significantly more than it hinders it”, and never wants to return to Java.\nCorporate Kotlin to Java backend migrations demonstrate that these happiness improvements scale effectively across enterprise environments. \nN26’s backend engineering team converted 60% of their microservices to Kotlin within two years, reporting enhanced developer satisfaction and reduced production issues.\nING’s five-year backend adoption journey shows sustained organic growth, with 8% of their 20,000+ technical staff repositories now using Kotlin, demonstrating that developers voluntarily choose Kotlin when given the option.\nThe cost / return on investment of embracing Kotlin:\nThese are the investments required for choosing Kotlin. \n\nInvestment DescriptionExpected Return / Impact\nDeveloper trainingTraining sessions, workshops, and onboarding materials.➜ Experienced developers new to Kotlin are productive in 2–3 weeks.\n➜ ROI in ~1–4 months.\nCodebase migration (if applicable)A gradual rewrite or a mixed Kotlin/Java code setup strategy is required.➜ No need for big bang rewrite\n➜ Maintains delivery speed.\nKnowledge sharingInternal Kotlin champions, brown bag sessions, shared repos with examples.➜ Faster team-wide adoption.\n➜ Reuse of best practices.\nHiring / upskillingHire Kotlin-experienced devs or upskill existing Java devs.➜ Higher retention.\n➜ Broader talent pool.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the most common concerns when considering Kotlin adoption is the perceived shortage of experienced Kotlin developers. But rather than a roadblock, this can be a strategic advantage:\n✅ Fast upskilling for Java developers\nKotlin is designed to be intuitive for Java developers. With the right guidance, most can become productive in just 2–3 weeks.\n✅ Kotlin attracts high-quality developers\nThose who actively pursue Kotlin are often curious, modern, and quality-driven – traits you want in your engineering team.\n✅ Kotlin enhances your company image\nAdopting Kotlin signals that you embrace modern, forward-looking technology, which helps attract top-tier talent.\n✅ Kotlin boosts developer happiness and retention\nKotlin developers consistently report higher job satisfaction, making it easier to retain engaged and motivated team members.\nIn short: Kotlin isn’t just a smart tech choice – it’s a strategic people decision.\nUp next in the series\nWe shift focus from convincing developers to persuading decision-makers. The next post shows how to build a compelling business case for Kotlin adoption, grounded in real data and measurable outcomes. You’ll learn how to translate developer wins into management arguments, link productivity gains to cost savings, and demonstrate why Kotlin is more than a technical upgrade – it’s a strategic move for teams and companies alike.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we love seeing the developer community grow and thrive. That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference — the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and to contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this post, we highlight five open‑source projects from different ecosystems, written in established languages like Python and JavaScript or fast‑growing ones like Rust. Different as they are, each shares the same goal: elevating the developer experience. Together, they show how the right tools boost productivity and make workflows more enjoyable.\nRatatui\nBorn as the community-driven successor to the discontinued tui-rs library, Ratatui brings elegance to terminal UIs. It’s modular, ergonomic, and designed to help developers build interactive dashboards, widgets, and even embedded interfaces that go beyond the terminal.\nJetBrains IDEs help me focus on the code rather than the tooling. They’re self-contained, so I don’t need to configure much to get started – they just work. With powerful code highlighting, automatic fixes, refactorings, and structural search, I can easily jump around the codebase and make edits.\n— Orhun Parmaksız, Ratatui Core Maintainer\nThe upcoming 0.30.0 release focuses on modularity, splitting the main crate into smaller, independently usable packages. This change simplifies maintenance and makes it easier to use widgets in other contexts. And with new no_std support, Ratatui is expanding to power a wide range of use cases beyond the terminal.\nDjango\nIf Ratatui brings usability to the terminal, Django brings it to the web. Originally created in 2003 to meet both fast-paced newsroom deadlines and the demands of experienced developers, Django remains the go-to framework for “perfectionists with deadlines”. It eliminates repetitive tasks, enforces clean, pragmatic design, and provides built-in solutions for security, scalability, and database management – helping developers write less code and achieve more.\nJetBrains IDEs, especially PyCharm, boost productivity with built-in Django support – including project templates, automatic settings detection, and model-to-database migrations – as well as integrated debugging and testing tools that simplify finding and fixing issues. The version control integration also makes it easier for contributors to refine and polish their work.\n— Sarah Boyce, Django Fellow\nBacked by a thriving global community, Django’s roadmap includes composite primary key support, built-in CSP integration, and a focus on making Django accessible by default. Every eight-month release delivers incremental improvements while maintaining backward compatibility – clear proof that long-term stability and innovation can coexist.\nJHipster\nBoth Django and JHipster help developers move fast, but they take different paths. JHipster began as the “anti-mullet stack” – serious in the back, party in the front – created to help developers quickly bootstrap full-stack applications with Spring on the backend and Angular.js on the frontend. Today, it’s still one of the most comprehensive open-source generators, offering a complete full-stack solution with built-in security, performance, and best practices.\nJHipster has always been about great productivity and great tooling, so naturally, we’ve always been IntelliJ IDEA fans – we even have our own JHipster IntelliJ IDEA plugin! What I love most is the clean UI, the performance, and all the plugins that make my life so much easier. I use Maven and Docker support all the time, and they’re both absolutely top-notch.\n— Julien Dubois, JHipster Creator\nThe project is now split into two teams – JHipster Classic, which focuses on the original full-stack generator written in JavaScript, and JHipster Lite, which develops a modernized, DDD-oriented version written in Java and targeted primarily at the backend. This structure allows the community to experiment more freely and attract new contributors.\nAs AI-assisted generation evolves, JHipster’s mission remains the same: empowering developers with the latest cutting-edge technology and a true full-stack approach.\nBiome\nOnce the structure is in place, consistency becomes the next challenge. That’s where Biome, a modern, all-in-one toolchain for maintaining web projects, comes in. It supports every major web language and maintains a consistent experience between the CLI and the editor. The goal of its creators was simple: make a tool that can handle everything from development to production, with fewer dependencies, less setup time, faster CI runs, and clear, helpful diagnostics.\nI’m a long-term user of JetBrains IDEs! RustRover has greatly improved since launch – its debugging features and new JavaScript module mean I can maintain all Biome projects, even our Astro-based website, in a single IDE. It’s great that JetBrains really listens to users and their feedback.\n— Emanuele Stoppa, Biome Creator\nBiome’s roadmap includes adding Markdown support, type inference, .d.ts file generation, JSDoc support, and embedded-language support. As a community-led project, Biome welcomes contributions of all kinds – every bit of help makes a difference.\nVuestic UI\nWhen it’s time to polish the frontend, Vuestic UI takes over. This open-source project focuses on accessibility, theming, and a delightful developer experience. Built for Vue 3, it offers a flexible, easy-to-use component library that scales effortlessly from quick prototypes to enterprise-grade dashboards.\nThe right development environment makes a huge difference when building complex open-source tools like Vuestic UI and Vuestic Admin. Our team relies on JetBrains IDEs every day for their best-in-class refactoring tools that let us make bold changes with confidence, fast and reliable code navigation, and rock-solid performance. Most of what we need works right out of the box – no extra plugins or setup required. For us, JetBrains isn’t just a preference – it’s a productivity multiplier.\n— Maxim Kobetz, Senior Vue.js Developer\nAfter 12 years in frontend development, WebStorm – along with IntelliJ IDEA and PyCharm – has always been my trusted toolkit. Even now, when I’m not coding every day, I know I can rely on WebStorm for quick tweaks – every update feels smooth and never disrupts my workflow. It’s intuitive, beautiful, and just works the way I expect it to. I know switching IDEs is always a time sink, but with JetBrains, it’s absolutely worth it – you’ll never want to switch again.\n— Anastasiia Zvenigorodskaia, Community Manager at Vuestic UI & Viuestic Admin\nThese projects showcase a common truth: Great developer experience happens when tools get out of your way. With JetBrains IDEs enhancing everything from code navigation to collaboration, these teams turn ideas into usable, elegant tools.\nExplore these projects, contribute if you can, or start your own! RustRover, WebStorm, and PyCharm are free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute.\nDownload RustRover\n                                                                Download WebStorm\n                                                                Download PyCharm",

Only prompt engineering matters now. Actually, I heard it’s overrated. You think we’re gonna be prompting in 5 years? 2 years? Nonsense. All this hype is being blown so out of proportion. Have some healthy skepticism. Have a lot of healthy skepticism. Doubt. Believe. Move to the woods. Bury your laptop in the back yard. Get bored. Dig it up again. Coding is back, baby! Start another course, work on it for a few days. Lose motivation. Panic. Repeat.\nYou’re not alone. As a writer, I’m also panicking. Why read this when you could ask the same question to your LLM of choice and have a lively discussion perfectly tuned to be as broad or technical, long or short, playful or serious, as you want it to be? This thought has tormented me for days and this post remained a blank document. The only thing that saved me was remembering why I made this series in the first place.\n\n\n\n\nI wanted to create a resource for learners to better understand programming within the context of our new AI world. I made a case for why it’s still worth learning to code, explored the psychology of beginner programmers, and discussed whether you should use AI at all. So, now what? \nWe know that programming will change – that programming has changed. But how exactly? And how much? What knowledge can we be sure will remain fundamental? What should we learn to prepare for the worlds to come?\nThere are a variety of answers depending on where you as the answerer stand. Is your net worth positively correlated with AI hype? Is your job too complicated, social, or important for AI? How is your relationship with risk? How do you feel about change? What do you believe about what the future needs? \n\n\n\n\nThese are not questions anyone can answer for you. Not me, not a tech CEO, not your mom, and certainly not a chatbot. We live in a world with platforms and educational institutions jumping to answer “What can I learn?” (a small reminder to check out our catalog of free courses), but there are very few resources that will give good answers to questions like “What should I learn?”, “Can you really justify why?”, and “Can you promise me it will remain useful?”.\nI can’t guarantee that anything you learn will remain useful in the years to come, but I am certain that learning will. On that subject, here are a few short recommendations on how to prepare for the future of programming.\nUnderstand the flaws of your education\nAre you in a large institution that is slow to adapt? Is AI use being discussed openly or banned from the classroom? Are you self-studying at your own pace, but lack any network of peers or mentors? Is your education giving you a broad overview of a field (a Bachelor’s degree) or is it leading you toward specialization and a specific job (bootcamp/internship)? \nBoth of these approaches are useful, they’re just working on different timelines. A broad overview can give you more options when the field changes, while a specialization can help you in the short term. Either way, try to compensate in the direction of your weaknesses so you’re not left either overqualified and underemployed, or unemployable when your only skill becomes redundant.\n\n\n\n\n📚 An exercise: Take 10 to 20 minutes to reflect on your education from a zoomed-out perspective. Think about what it did or is doing well and what gaps you might be left with at the end of it. Below you’ll find a few recommendations on how to fill those gaps, but feel free to brainstorm your own as well.\nHow to broaden your knowledge\nIf you’ve got practical skills but worry about their shelf life, now is the time to foster curiosity about the wider scope of your field. This will feel different than learning a practical skill, since there are fewer concrete ways to assess your progress. Instead, pay attention to the moments when ideas from different domains click together. This is a sign that you’re starting to expand your general knowledge and get a clearer view of the big picture.\nHere are some practical ways to do this:\n🧑‍🎓 Follow short courses in other domains. Our knowledge map can help you visualize what subjects you might find interesting to explore, or you can even consider departing from computing altogether. Bringing technical expertise to a writing course might lead to great science fiction, or an interesting exercise in applied philosophy.\n🧰 Work on projects that use a broad skillset but don’t require professional excellence. Make a silly app that needs a little bit of frontend, a little bit of backend, knowledge of APIs, and even graphic design. It might be ugly and inefficient, the point is that you did it.\n\nSince motivation might be difficult to maintain on your own, find someone with a different skillset and swap roles.\n👯 If you consider yourself a “technical person”, focus especially on communication skills and critical thinking. These are particularly important in navigating the uncertain future we’re facing, since purely technical jobs are in many ways the easiest to automate away.\nHow to deepen your knowledge\nPersonally, I find it really hard to specialize. I jump between interests, rarely sticking with anything long enough to achieve mastery. This used to stress me out – how could I be good at my job if I couldn’t commit to one thing? But I’ve learned that the pressure to specialize is often about legibility, not capability. We like people who are easy to categorize. In practice, though, proficiency in one skill lends itself to an easier time with others.\nDepth is what makes you adaptable. Surface-level knowledge can get outdated quickly. Understanding underlying principles like how systems actually work, not just how to use them, means you can transfer what you know to new tools and frameworks. When the landscape shifts, you’re not starting from scratch.\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll have to choose your approach depending on the specific skill you want to master. Here’s how to do this:\n🧑‍🏫 Get advice from someone who’s done it before, ideally someone who can personally mentor you. To get started, there are plenty of “Things I wish I’d known before becoming x” videos, which might help you wade through what’s necessary and what’s not. \n💻 Regarding coding, our specializations courses provide very comprehensive and practical assignments in various domains.\n💯 If you, like me, quickly lose interest once the novelty wears off, I can recommend tailoring your media diet toward your target subject. Reading books and listening to stories of people talking about your subject on a high level helps you remember what sparked your interest in the first place. To start, you could check out our video essay on the history of Git!\nGoodbye, AI world\nYou don’t need to understand tech to do things with it anymore. Now you can build apps, write code, or generate designs without understanding the underlying systems. There’s real value in that accessibility, but as a writer and coder, I worry about what we lose. If we go all-in on doing things, we might forget that developing deep knowledge and understanding can be fun and good for us. It might even be a requirement for our mental health and self-esteem. To not only be able to make an app, but to take pride in the fact that you learned how to.\nGet a free student license\n                                                                Explore our course catalog\n                                    \nThis is the fourth and final post in our series How to Learn to Program in an AI World.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Developers spend much of their time editing, refactoring, and debugging rather than producing entirely new code. Code creation tends to involve non-sequential back-and-forth refinement rather than typing out a complete function in one uninterrupted sequence. You might sketch a part, adjust parameters, skip ahead, then revisit earlier sections to refine them. \nDiffusion models, and in particular diffusion large language models (d-LLMs), operate differently from current coding assistants. Unlike autoregressive models, which generate token by token in a strict left-to-right sequence, d-LLMs condition on both past and future context. This enables them to model edits and refinements more directly, reflecting how developers iteratively construct and adjust code. As shown by Gong et al. (2025): “the [d-LLM] model often plans token generation more globally, much like a programmer jumping back and forth through code to refine a code implementation.” This matches the reality of code authorship, which is non-linear: you sketch a bit, revise earlier parts, jump ahead, and keep iterating.\nOut-of-order generation feels more human\nOne of the most striking demos of diffusion-based models like DiffuCoder showed exactly this: the model skipped a parameter mid-function, continued writing later parts, then circled back to fill in what was missing.\n\n\n\n\n(The prompt used here is: “Write a Python function to implement binary search together with docstrings and type hints.” The example is generated using the apple/DiffuCoder-7B-Instruct model, configured to produce one token per forward pass with a limit of 256 new tokens. The blue slots illustrate positions that the model later revisits and refines during the diffusion process.)\nThis structure may mirror how many developers think. You may not know every detail upfront, but you can scaffold a function and refine as you go. A model that generates in a sequential way is better suited to support this process.\nBi-directional context improves reasoning\nAutoregressive models can be prompted to consider bidirectional context by providing both prefix and suffix in the prompt, but this remains a workaround rather than a native capability. Diffusion models, particularly diffusion large language models (d-LLMs), are designed from the ground up to condition on both past and future context during generation.\nThis design proves valuable for tasks requiring reversal reasoning, where coherence must hold in both directions, and for code generation, where a variable’s usage downstream should inform its earlier definition. As shown by Nie at al. (2025), d-LLMs exhibit “consistent zero-shot performance across both forward and reversal tasks.”\nFor developers, this translates into improved handling of structured logic, long-range dependencies, and code constraints that depend on order-sensitive relationships.\nFlexibility in editing and refactoring\nBecause diffusion models mask and unmask tokens gradually at any random position, they are naturally suited to infilling. If you ask a diffusion model to rewrite a block of code with a different parameter or to refactor a loop into a comprehension, it can directly operate on masked sections. \nThe distinction with autoregressive LLMs is subtle here, since both require the relevant code region to appear in the prompt. Where diffusion models add value is in integration with deterministic tooling such as IDEs. An IDE could highlight several problematic or incomplete regions, mask them, and allow the diffusion model to unmask and regenerate all affected parts in a single coherent pass. This distinguishes diffusion models from FIM-enabled autoregressive models, which can handle isolated infilling but struggle to maintain global consistency across multiple edits.\nExample: coordinated multi-region updates\nConsider adding a field to a class that must be initialised in the constructor, used in a method, and serialised elsewhere. Rather than orchestrating multiple FIM calls or regenerating entire methods, a diffusion model can mask the relevant locations and generate all necessary updates at once. \nThis makes diffusion models well-suited to refactoring tasks where changes must satisfy global constraints, such as ensuring a new parameter appears consistently in a function signature, its documentation, call sites, and test cases.\nFor example, an IDE might flag a type mismatch in a function signature. Instead of regenerating the entire function, a diffusion model could unmask just the problematic parameter declaration and rewrite it to match the expected type, leaving the rest of the code untouched. This localised editing process mirrors how developers typically fix errors and refactor code incrementally.\nPotential speed improvements\nAutoregressive models operate sequentially, generating one token per forward pass. Diffusion models, by contrast, can produce multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Benchmarks reveal a current practical shortcoming: increasing the number of tokens per step often reduces quality. The underlying mechanism, however, allows faster inference and is likely to improve in future.\nResearchers have proposed semi-autoregressive approaches to bridge the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based generation – most notably Block Diffusion – Arriola et al. (2025). This method generates blocks of tokens from left to right while allowing diffusion models to unmask flexibly within each block. In principle, this allows reuse of the KV cache, which plays a key role in the efficiency of autoregressive models. In practice, however, unmasking too many tokens in parallel creates a trade-off. Throughput increases, but quality often drops sharply, especially if the KV cache is not reused carefully.\nSemi-autoregressive generation represents an intermediate step between autoregressive and truly out-of-order inference. Diffusion-based language models work fundamentally out of sequence, yet current methods still borrow ideas from autoregressive design, such as KV cache reuse, because the optimisation tools for autoregressive generation remain highly developed and effective. Ironically, these mature autoregressive mechanisms improve generation speed even as research moves towards models that can generate fully out of order.\nCurrent limitations\nFor now, developers should temper expectations. Our internal experimentations with latest open-source models show that:\nThe best quality comes when unmasking one token per step, which slows things down and makes these models not differ much from AR models in practice.\nDiffusion models can repeat prefixes or suffixes, or even output incoherent text when pushed too far.\n\nRepetition: model re-outputs entire prefix blocks multiple times.\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef factorial(n):   # repeated\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\ndef factorial(n):   # repeated again\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\nEarly termination: incomplete function bodies or truncated expressions.\n\n\n\n\n\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return n * factorial(   # truncated, no argument\nMalformed syntax: unmatched brackets, dangling commas, or gibberish tokens.\ndef factorial(n):\n    if (n == 0:\n        return 1,\n    else:\n        return n ** factorial[n - 1))\nBenchmarking current state-of-the-art d-LLMs – open source (DiffuCoder, Seed-Diffusion) and closed-source (Mercury, Gemini-Diffusion) – shows mixed performance when compared against strong autoregressive baselines such as Qwen2.5-Coder. See Gong et al. (2025) and Song, Yuxuan et al. (2025).\nDespite these issues, diffusion models still introduce valuable new possibilities for code generation and editing. At the same time, their ecosystem is very immature compared to autoregressive LLMs. \nTraining and inference techniques that help mitigate sequential bottlenecks in LLMs, such as chunked prefill, speculative decoding, or prefix caching, have no direct equivalents yet for diffusion models. \nDiffusion also requires defining output length in advance, which often leads to inefficiency compared to the <eos> termination signal in LLMs. \nFinally, the open-source diffusion models for code makes it harder for developers to experiment and refine these methods.\nWhere they can be useful today\nCode completion with context editing – filling in missing parts of a function rather than only extending text.\nRefactoring support – restructuring code blocks where order is less rigid.\nStructured text tasks – mathematical reasoning or reversal problems where bi-directional context matters.\n\n\n\n\nThese niches give developers a reason to experiment, even if production-ready tools remain a little way off. Beyond these early applications, the major promise of d-LLMs lies in their potential for much faster generation, since they can produce N tokens per forward pass rather than one. \nThis capability could eventually reshape performance expectations for coding assistants once the quality–efficiency trade-offs are better understood.\nLooking ahead\nDiffusion models won’t replace autoregressive models overnight. But they represent a new paradigm that better reflects how developers think and work. Their ability to edit flexibly, consider context in both directions, and potentially accelerate inference sets them apart.\nFor developers, the practical benefit is clear: more snappy generation, and more support for the unstructured, iterative way you actually write code.\nAs research continues, diffusion models could become the backbone of coding assistants that feels less like next token generators and more like principled, code structure-aware, programming collaborators.",

        "contentSnippet": "혹시 AI 앱을 만들고도 소스 노출, 로그인 불편함 때문에 배포를 망설였나요?  GitHub와 Vercel을 활용해 코딩 없이도 AI 앱을 전 세계에 안전하게 배포하고 독립적인 웹사이트로 만드는 방법을 알려드립니다. 특히 API 키 보안까지 완벽하게 해결하는 노하우를 공개합니다. 이제 여러분의 아이디어를 전 세계와 공유하세요!\n\n\n 여러분이 어렵게 만든 AI 앱, 혹시 여전히 AI Studio 빌드 링크로만 공유하고 계셨나요? 물론 편리하긴 하지만, 저는 그 방법이 항상 아쉬웠어요. 로그인해야 볼 수 있고, 무엇보다 내 소스 코드가 그대로 노출된다는 점이 너무 신경 쓰였거든요. 아이디어가 고스란히 공개되는 기분이라고 해야 할까요? 게다가 API 키 유출 걱정까지… 정말 답답한 부분들이 많았죠.\n하지만 걱정 마세요! 오늘은 이 모든 고민을 한 번에 날려버릴 수 있는 아주 특별한 방법을 알려드리려고 해요. 코딩을 전혀 몰라도, 여러분이 만든 AI 앱을 진짜 전문가처럼 독립적인 웹사이트 형태로 전 세계에 공개하는 방법! 그것도 단 몇 분 만에 가능하답니다. 지금 보고 계신 이런 멋진 웹사이트도 이 방법으로 만들 수 있어요. 어때요, 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n이 강의 하나면 여러분의 앱은 더 이상 구글 로그인도, AI Studio 빌드 사용법 숙지도 필요 없이 그저 링크만 클릭하면 바로 사용할 수 있게 됩니다. 무엇보다 소스 코드까지 안전하게 보호되니, 이제 마음 놓고 여러분의 멋진 아이디어를 세상에 보여줄 수 있을 거예요. \n  GitHub: 내 코드의 안전한 온라인 저장소\n먼저, 우리의 소스 코드와 파일들을 안전하게 보관하고 관리해 줄 든든한 온라인 저장소, GitHub(깃허브)에 대해 간단히 알아볼게요. 사실 깃허브는 개발자들에게는 거의 필수적인 서비스라고 할 수 있어요. 쉽게 말해 우리가 만든 코드나 파일을 안전하게 저장하고 관리할 수 있는 온라인 저장소라고 보시면 됩니다. 마치 구글 드라이브나 네이버 클라우드처럼 파일을 올려두는 공간인데, 특히 개발자들이 코드를 저장하고 공유하는 데 특화되어 있죠. 전 세계 개발자들이 모여 함께 작업하고 공유하는 공간, 그렇게 이해하면 좀 더 쉽지 않을까 싶어요.\n\n\n깃허브 계정 생성하기\n깃허브 계정을 만드는 건 정말 간단해요. 이미 많은 분이 구글 계정을 가지고 계실 테니, 그걸 활용하면 1분도 채 걸리지 않을 거예요. 정말 편해졌죠!\ngithub.com에 접속 후 메인 화면 중앙의 'Sign Up' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n다음 화면에서 'Continue with Google'을 선택하고 사용할 구글 아이디를 클릭하세요.\n깃허브 로그인 화면에서 '계속'을 클릭한 후, 깃허브에서 사용할 사용자명(Username)을 확인하고 'Create account'를 클릭합니다.\n잠시 기다리면 바로 여러분의 깃허브 사용자 화면으로 이동할 거예요.\n첫 번째 저장소(Repository) 만들기\n깃허브에서는 코드나 파일을 저장하는 공간을 '저장소(Repository)'라고 부르는데요. 이 저장소를 만드는 것부터 시작해볼게요.\n왼쪽에 있는 'Create Repository' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n'Repository name'과 'Description'을 입력하세요. 간단한 HTML 랜딩 페이지를 예시로 든다면, 이름과 설명을 'first-homepage'로 지정할 수 있겠죠.\n참고로, 깃허브에서는 이 저장소명이 여러분의 웹페이지 주소 일부가 됩니다 (예: github.com/사용자명/first-homepage). 나중에 소스 공유할 때 요긴하게 쓰이니 기억해두세요.\n파일 업로드 및 관리\n이제 저장소가 생겼으니 파일을 추가해야겠죠? 깃허브에서는 직접 코드를 입력하거나 소스 파일을 업로드할 수 있어요.\n화면 중앙의 'creating a new file'을 클릭하면 코드 편집 화면에서 직접 소스를 입력할 수 있습니다.\n'uploading an existing file'을 클릭하면 외부 파일을 업로드할 수 있어요. 우리는 미리 만들어 둔 HTML 파일을 등록해 봅시다.\n파일 업로드가 끝나면 'Commit changes' 란에 간단한 변경사항과 설명을 입력하고 'Commit changes' 버튼을 클릭하면 업로드가 완료됩니다.\n  꿀팁: 업로드한 파일은 언제든지 수정할 수 있어요. 파일을 클릭해 미리보기 화면으로 이동한 후 우측 상단의 연필 모양 아이콘을 클릭하면 편집 화면으로 전환됩니다. 수정 후 다시 'Commit changes' 버튼을 클릭하면 되죠. 깃허브는 이렇게 여러 파일들의 변경사항을 한눈에 확인할 수 있어서 정말 편리합니다.\n아, 그리고 중요한 점! 메인 HTML 파일명은 반드시 'index'로 변경해주세요. 대부분의 웹 서버는 기본적으로 `index.html` 파일을 해당 디렉터리의 메인 페이지로 인식하거든요. 이 부분은 꼭 기억해야 할 핵심 포인트예요.\n  Vercel: 내 앱을 전 세계로 배포하는 마법\n자, 이제 깃허브에 잘 올려둔 우리의 소중한 파일들을 실제 웹사이트로 만들어주는 Vercel(버셀)이라는 서비스를 사용해 볼 시간입니다. 버셀은 우리가 만든 웹사이트를 전 세계 누구나 접속할 수 있는 실제 인터넷 주소로 만들어주는, 정말 고마운 서비스예요. 특히 개인 프로젝트나 비상업적 용도에 적합한 무료 요금제(Hobby 플랜)를 제공하는데, 신용카드 등록 없이도 사용할 수 있을 정도로 상당히 관대한 한도를 제공합니다. 부담 없이 시작할 수 있다는 거죠! 제가 직접 써보니 개인 개발자에게 이만한 서비스가 없었어요.\n\n\n버셀 계정 생성 및 깃허브 연결\n버셀 계정 생성도 깃허브만큼이나 간단해요. 그리고 무엇보다 중요한 건 깃허브와 연동하는 과정이죠.\n주소창에 vercel.com을 입력하고 접속합니다. 메인 페이지 오른쪽 위의 'Sign Up' 버튼을 클릭하세요.\n구독 플랜 중 무료인 'Hobby'를 선택하고 사용자명(Username)을 입력한 후 'Continue' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n여기서 중요! 반드시 'GitHub' 버튼을 클릭하세요. 팝업창 아래 'Authorize Vercel'을 클릭하면 버셀 가입이 완료됩니다.\n다음으로 깃허브 설치를 위해 중앙의 'Install' 버튼을 클릭합니다. 팝업창에서 'All repositories'를 선택하고 'Install' 버튼을 다시 클릭하면, 깃허브와 버셀의 연동 작업이 끝납니다.\n첫 앱 배포하기\n이제 깃허브와 버셀이 연결되었으니, 우리가 깃허브에 올려둔 프로젝트를 배포해 볼 차례예요.\n연결이 완료되면 좀 전에 깃허브를 통해 작업한 저장소 목록이 보일 거예요. 여기서 우리가 배포하고 싶은 저장소 옆의 'Import' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n버셀은 정말 똑똑해서 프로젝트에 포함된 소스를 자동으로 분석해요. '아, 이건 HTML 파일이네!' 하고 다 파악한 후 최적화된 설정을 보여주니, 우리는 그저 'Deploy' 버튼만 클릭하면 끝! 정말 쉽죠?\n잠시 후 '축하합니다!' 메시지와 함께 미리보기 화면이 나타나면, 정상적으로 배포(Deploy)가 완료된 겁니다. 화면 아래 버튼을 클릭하여 대시보드로 이동하세요.\n'Production Deployment' 화면에서 'Domains' 섹션을 보면 방금 배포가 완료된 우리 앱(웹페이지)의 주소가 보입니다. 이 주소를 공유하면 다른 사람들이 바로 접속해서 사용할 수 있어요.\n  팁: 버셀과 깃허브를 처음 연결할 때만 이런 복잡한(?) 과정이 필요하고, 그다음부터는 버셀 대시보드에서 우측 상단의 'Visit'를 클릭해 프로젝트를 선택하는 것으로 간단하게 관리할 수 있어요.\nCI/CD: 지속적인 통합과 배포의 마법\n그럼 배포한 앱에 수정사항이 발생하면 앞서 알려드린 연결에서 배포까지의 모든 과정을 다시 거쳐야 할까요? 물론 아니죠! 여기서 깃허브와 버셀 연동의 진짜 마법이 펼쳐집니다.\n이제 깃허브는 우리가 코드를 수정할 때마다 버셀에게 “방금 코드를 수정했어요!”라고 자동으로 알려줍니다. 그러면 버셀이 알아서 새로운 버전으로 다시 배포를 시작하고요. 이걸 바로 개발자들이 말하는 CI(Continuous Integration)/CD(Continuous Delivery), 즉 지속적 통합과 지속적 배포라고 해요. 제가 직접 테스트해 보니 정말 신기하고 편했어요. 한 번 예시를 통해 볼까요?\n깃허브에서 앞서 배포한 HTML 파일의 제목을 \"유용한 에이아이 도구 모음\"으로 수정합니다.\n'Commit changes'의 변경사항을 '제목 수정'이라고 입력하고 저장합니다.\n그러면 버셀로 이동해서 보면, 수정된 내용이 반영되어 자동으로 재배포가 진행되고, 실제 실행을 해보면 변경사항이 제대로 적용된 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 정말 편리하지 않나요?\n⚙️ AI Studio 앱 배포: API 유무에 따른 전략\n이제 단순 HTML 파일이 아닌, AI Studio 빌드에서 작업한 실제 AI 앱을 깃허브에 업로드하고 버셀로 배포하는 방법을 알려드릴게요. 이때 중요한 건, 앱이 API를 사용하는지 여부에 따라 접근 방식이 조금 달라진다는 점이에요.\nAI Studio 앱 깃허브 업로드\nAI Studio에서 만든 앱을 깃허브에 올리는 과정은 놀랍도록 간편합니다.\n먼저 AI Studio 빌드 채팅창에서 여러분이 만들었던 앱을 띄워놓습니다. 예를 들어, 휴대폰 배경화면을 생성하는 모바일 전용 한글 웹 앱을 만들어 달라고 요청했던 앱이 될 수 있겠죠.\n우측 상단의 깃허브 아이콘('GitHub에 저장' 버튼)을 클릭하고 '깃허브에 로그인하여 계속하기'를 클릭합니다.\n팝업창에서 아래로 스크롤하여 '설치 및 승인' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n저장소 이름과 설명을 입력하고 'Public'을 선택한 후 'Create Git Repo'를 클릭합니다.\n다음 화면에 업로드할 파일 목록이 보일 거예요. 화면 아래 'Stage and commit all changes' 버튼을 클릭하면 깃허브로 업로드하는 과정이 완료됩니다.\n버셀을 통한 AI Studio 앱 배포 (API 유무)\n이제 깃허브에 올라간 AI Studio 앱을 버셀로 배포해봅시다. 여기서 중요한 차이점을 발견할 수 있을 거예요.\n버셀로 가서 우측 상단에 'Visit'를 클릭해서 프로젝트를 선택한 후, 조금 전에 업로드한 깃허브 프로젝트를 'Import'하면 됩니다.\n우리가 앞서 배포한 건 단순한 HTML 파일이라 `index.html` 파일명이 중요했어요. 하지만 지금 배포한 AI 앱은, 버셀이 '이건 React 기반 앱이구나!' 하고 자동으로 인식합니다. 그래서 파일명 같은 것을 전혀 신경 쓸 필요 없이 'Import'와 'Deploy' 버튼만 누르면 배포가 완료돼요. 정말 똑똑하죠!\n이런 식으로 경주마 레이싱 게임 'Gee Wiz' 같은 AI를 사용하지 않는 (즉, API가 필요 없는) 앱은 에러 없이 제대로 배포되고 발행된 주소를 통해서도 잘 접속되며 정상 작동하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 저도 배포하고 나서 바로 게임을 플레이해봤는데 정말 만족스러웠어요.\n⚠️ 주의: 그런데 사실, 제미나이 API를 사용하는 첫 번째 앱은 배포 과정에서 문제는 없었지만 실행하면 아무 화면도 보이지 않았을 거예요. 왜냐하면 제미나이 API를 사용하고 있기 때문입니다. 물론 버셀에서 프로젝트를 세팅할 때 API 키를 등록할 수도 있지만, 이렇게 배포하게 되면 여러분의 API를 다른 사람들이 무단으로 사용하게 되어 보안이나 예상치 못한 비용 발생의 문제가 생길 수 있어요. 이 점은 정말 중요합니다!\n  API 키 보안: 사용자에게 키 관리 맡기기\n결국, 앱은 여러분이 만들어 배포하고 API는 사용자들의 것으로 사용하게 해야겠죠. 이게 가장 이상적인 방법입니다. 그래야 여러분의 API 키가 안전하게 보호되고 불필요한 비용 발생을 막을 수 있어요. 이제 AI Studio 앱을 수정하여 사용자 로컬 드라이브에 API 키를 암호화하여 저장하고 테스트하는 기능을 추가해볼게요.\nAI Studio 앱 수정: 외장형 API 키 관리로 전환\nAI Studio 빌드의 강력한 기능을 활용해 앱에 외장형 API 키 관리 기능을 추가해봅시다.\nAI Studio 빌드에서 첫 번째 앱(모바일 배경화면 생성기)을 다시 불러옵니다.\n채팅창에 \"API key 관리를 내장형이 아닌 외장형으로 변경해야 해. 버튼을 클릭하면 이 앱에 사용된 모든 API 키를 사용자 로컬 드라이브에 암호화해서 저장하고, 연결 테스트를 하는 팝업창을 생성해\"라고 요청합니다.\n요청이 완료되면, 완성된 앱에는 API 키를 입력하고 연결 테스트 한 후 저장하는 기능이 추가된 것을 확인할 수 있을 거예요. 이러면 앱 개발자도 내장된 API가 아닌, API 키를 발급받아 사용하게 됩니다.\n기능이 추가되었으니, 수정된 소스를 깃허브에 다시 업로드하는 것을 잊지 마세요!\nGoogle Cloud에서 API 키 발급받기\n이제 사용자에게 제공할 API 키를 Google Cloud에서 발급받는 방법을 알아볼게요. 이 키를 통해 사용자가 직접 자신의 환경에서 AI 모델을 활용할 수 있게 됩니다.\nGoogle Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/)에 접속합니다.\n'프로젝트 만들기 또는 선택' 버튼을 클릭합니다. 이미 다른 프로젝트가 있다면, 화면처럼 순서대로 클릭해서 새 프로젝트를 만들 수 있어요.\n새 프로젝트에서 '프로젝트 명'을 입력하고 '만들기'를 클릭합니다.\n프로젝트가 제대로 생성이 되었는지 좌측 상단의 프로젝트 버튼을 클릭, 방금 생성된 프로젝트 명을 선택한 후 계정이 활성화된 것을 확인하세요.\n다시 AI Studio 빌드로 가서 우측 상단에 'Switch to API key' 아이콘을 클릭합니다.\n그다음 'Create a new key'를 선택하고 '프로젝트 가져오기'에서 좀 전에 만든 프로젝트를 체크하고 가져오기 합니다.\n가져온 프로젝트를 선택한 후, 키 이름을 입력하고 '키 만들기'를 클릭하세요. 이러면 API 키가 만들어지긴 하지만, 키 값을 바로 확인할 수는 없습니다.\n키 값을 얻기 위해 AI Studio 첫 화면에서 좌측 하단에 'Get API key'를 선택하면 보이는 프로젝트 목록 우측에, 복사 아이콘을 클릭하면 키 값이 복사됩니다. 이제 이 키를 여러분의 앱 사용자에게 제공할 수 있습니다.\nAPI 키 테스트 및 최종 확인\n발급받은 API 키가 제대로 작동하는지 확인하는 과정도 중요해요. 저는 제 스마트폰에서도 직접 확인해봤는데, 정말 뿌듯했어요.\n다시 앱으로 돌아와 우측 상단의 키 관리 창을 열고 방금 복사한 키 값을 넣고 '연결 테스트'를 합니다. 문제가 없다면 성공!\n마지막으로 버셀에서 배포된 앱의 주소로 가서 API 키 값을 테스트해도 아무런 문제가 없음을 확인합니다. 제 스마트폰에서도 완벽하게 동작하는 것을 확인했습니다. 이제 여러분의 AI 앱은 완벽한 독립 웹사이트로 전 세계에 서비스될 준비를 마친 겁니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1. GitHub는 코드와 파일을 안전하게 관리하고 협업하는 온라인 저장소입니다.\n2. Vercel은 GitHub와 연동하여 웹 앱을 전 세계에 무료로 배포할 수 있는 강력한 플랫폼입니다.\n3. AI 앱 배포 시, `index.html` 파일명과 CI/CD 자동 배포 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다.\n4. API 키 보안을 위해 AI Studio 앱을 수정하여 사용자가 직접 API 키를 관리하도록 설정해야 합니다.\n이 네 가지 핵심 사항만 잘 이해하고 적용한다면, 여러분도 2025년 최고의 AI 앱 개발자로 거듭날 수 있습니다!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 코딩을 전혀 몰라도 정말 AI 앱을 배포할 수 있나요?\n네, 물론입니다! AI Studio 빌드에서 앱을 만들고, GitHub와 Vercel은 직관적인 인터페이스를 제공하기 때문에 코딩 지식이 없어도 충분히 배포할 수 있습니다. 오늘 배운 가이드라인을 따라하면 누구든 가능해요.\nQ2: Vercel의 무료 요금제(Hobby 플랜)는 어느 정도까지 사용할 수 있나요?\nVercel의 Hobby 플랜은 개인 프로젝트 및 비상업적 용도에 매우 관대한 한도를 제공합니다. 월별 빌드 시간, 대역폭, 함수 실행 등 대부분의 개인 개발자가 충분히 사용할 수 있는 수준이에요. 신용카드 등록 없이 시작할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.\nQ3: AI Studio 앱의 API 키 보안이 왜 그렇게 중요한가요?\nAPI 키는 여러분의 계정과 연결되어 AI 모델 사용에 대한 비용이 발생할 수 있습니다. 만약 키가 노출되면 다른 사람이 무단으로 사용해 예상치 못한 과금이 발생하거나, 여러분의 API 사용 한도가 소진될 수 있기 때문에 철저한 보안이 필수적입니다. 사용자가 직접 키를 관리하게 하는 것이 가장 안전한 방법입니다.\n오늘 강의 내용을 다시 한번 정리해드리면서 마무리할까 합니다. 여러분은 오늘 AI Studio 빌드에서 만든 앱을 깃허브에 저장하고, 버셀을 통해 누구나 접속할 수 있는 실제 웹사이트로 배포하는 전 과정을 배우셨습니다. 정말 많은 것을 해내신 거예요!\n이 방법을 통해, 이제 여러분은 구글 로그인이나 소스 코드 노출 걱정 없이 안전하게 자신의 AI 앱을 공유할 수 있게 되었습니다. 특히 중요한 점은, 제미나이 API를 사용하는 앱의 경우, 여러분의 API 키를 보호하기 위해 반드시 '외장형'으로 관리 방식을 변경해야 한다는 것이었죠. 사용자가 직접 자신의 API 키를 입력하게 만들어, 보안과 비용 문제를 모두 현명하게 해결했습니다.\n  이 기사에서 사용된 2개의 앱 무료링크\n  AI 모바일 배경화면 생성기 \n공유용 : https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1tuSsk3Vc1ZNMDPwjzLZh_PYoKHQmrig1\n배포용 : https://mobile-wallpaper-generator.vercel.app/\n  GEE WIZ 경마게임 \n공유용 :  https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1whAHjrX-Wg7n4jWwjZZ3rVbGMsyU3nVz\n배포용 :  https://gee-wiz.vercel.app/",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새 한국의 어린이들 10명에게 나중에 커서 뭐 하고 싶은지 물어보면 절반 이상이 연예인, 가수 또는 유튜버가 되고 싶다고 대답한다는 이야기를 전에 어디서 들었다. 관련 자료를 찾아보려고 했는데, 공식적인 시장 조사 자료는 없지만 한국 사회의 분위기를 보면 대충 맞을 것 같고 아마도 몇 년 후에는 이렇게 대답하는 어린이들이 10명 중 10명이 될 것 같은 느낌도 든다.\n나이가 좀 있는 분들과의 식사 자리였는데, 당시 모임에서 대부분 한국의 장래가 어둡고, 요새 젊은 애들 정말 문제가 많다는 분위기 속에서 이런 이야기가 나오긴 했는데 솔직히 나는 이게 그렇게 한국의 미래에 나쁜 영향을 미칠 건 아니라고 했던 기억이 난다. 내가 초등학생일 때 “너희 장래 희망이 뭐니? (너희 커서 뭐가 되고 싶니?)”라고 물어보면 대부분 대통령, 과학자, 교수님, 의사, 변호사, 경찰관, 소방관, 올림픽 금메달리스트 등과 같은 사회에서 전반적으로 존경받고, 좋고 안정적으로 인식되는 직업을 택했다. 나도 아마도 과학자라고 항상 대답했던 것 같은데, 지금 생각해 보면 솔직히 내가 원하는 것보단 주위 사람들이 바라던 답을 했던 것 같다.\n연예인과 유튜버가 과연 과학자나 대통령보다 못 한 직업일까? 일단 위에서 이야기한 모임에 있던 분들 대부분은 그렇게 생각했던 것 같다. 실은 나도 몇 년 전까지만 해도 연예인과 유튜버는 제대로 된 직업이 아니라고 생각했었지만, 이젠 완전히 생각이 바뀌었다. 정확히 말하자면 그동안 보고 검토했던 사업들과 빠르게 변하고 있는 세상 때문에 바뀌기도 했지만, 내가 스스로 내 생각과 인식을 바꾸기 위해서 부단히 노력하기도 했다. 어쨌든, 나는 위의 모임에서 왜 유튜버, 인플루언서 등을 지칭하는 크리에이터라는 업종이 우리가 아는 일반적인 직장과 크게 다르지 않고 실은 왜 훨씬 더 좋은 직업인지 열심히 내 생각을 말했고, 그분들에게 계속 이런 고리타분한 생각을 하면 빠르게 변하는 세상에서 점점 더 도태될 수밖에 없다는 경고도 여러 번 날렸다.\n우리 아버지 세대, 그리고 우리 세대 초반까지만 해도 돈을 벌 수 있는 유일한 수단은 회사에 출근하는 것이었다. 9시에 출근해서 6시에 퇴근하는 게 남과 내가 생각하는, 합법적으로 돈을 벌 수 있는 정상적인 직장 생활이었다. 그런데 요새 우리는 회사로 출근은커녕, 침대에서 잠옷 입고 전 세계 1억 명을 대상으로 말도 안 되는 이야기와 행동을 하면서 연 매출 10억 원을 만들 수 있는, 나같이 올드한 세대가 봤을 땐 참으로 신기한 세상에 살고 있다. 그리고 앞으로 이런 변화와 신기함은 계속 가속화될 것이다. 우리가 만나는 창업가들을 보면서 나는 이 변화를 직접 매일매일 느낄 수 있다. 왜냐하면 점점 더 많은 창업가와 이들이 하는 사업에 대해서 듣다 보면 가장 먼저 떠오르는 생각은, “이게 뭐야 ?”이고, 어떤 사업은 내가 전혀 이해할 수가 없기 때문이다.\n실은, 이런 창업가와 사업을 접할 때마다 “이런 건 사업이 아냐. 제대로 된 직장 경험도 없는 어린애가 폰 앞에서 말도 안 되는 이야기 하는 걸 누가 봐.”라고 생각하면서 그냥 무시하고 패스하는 게 속 편할 수도 있지만, 새로운 시각과 생각으로 모든 걸 바라봐야 한다는 걸 나는 잘 알기 때문에, 불편하기도 하지만 열심히 노력하고 있다.\n새로운 세상에는 새로운 시각과 새로운 생각이 필요하다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새같이 창업 scene이 재미있고 짜릿했을 때가 없을 정도로 좋은 기술과 좋은 창업가들이 이 생태계에서 많이 보인다. 일어나서 다시 잘 때까지, 이 짧은 시간 동안 매일매일 뭔가 새로운 기술과 제품이 시장에 홍수같이 쏟아져서 남들보다 앞서가긴커녕, 남들과 페이스를 맞추고 따라가기도 힘들 정도로 벅차고, 가끔은 공황 상태에 빠지기도 하지만, 일상이 항상 똑같아서 매너리즘에 빠져 있는 다른 직장인들에 비하면 너무나 행복한 고민이다.\n이런 행복한 고민을 하면서 매우 정신없지만, 동시에 정신적으로 만족하고 있는 와중에 요새 내 심기를 건드리는 사람들이 몇 명 있는데, 굳이 하지 않아도 되는 돈지랄을 하는 창업가들이다. 원래 개인적으로 돈이 많거나, 아니면 엑싯을 해서 돈을 번 창업가 이야기가 아니다. 개인적으로 돈 많다고 자랑하고, 본인이 직접 열심히 번 돈을 어떻게 쓰든, 그건 전혀 상관없는데, 내가 여기서 말하는 돈지랄 하는 창업가들은 남의 돈을 마치 자기 돈으로 착각하고, 뭐 여기까진 봐줄 만하지만, 자기 돈같이 생각하는 걸 넘어서 자기 돈같이 쓰는 그런 어리석은 사람들이다.\n일단 시작은 쓸데없이 비싼 음식점에서의 회식, 그리고 안 가도 되는 술집으로 시작하는 것 같다. 모두 다 접대와 영업이라는 명목하에 진행되는데, 결국 돈은 개인 지갑에서 나오는 게 아니라 전부 법카로 처리한다. 법카 비용은 누구 돈으로 정산되는가? 투자받은 돈이다. 큰 계약을 하기 위해서, 좋은 인재 채용을 위해서, 경영진의 리더십 워크샵 때문에,,,뭐 갖다 붙이면 그럴싸한데, 회사에 돈 없으면 못 하는, 회사에 돈 있어도 안 해도 되는 돈지랄이다. 이런 거 안 해도 회사 잘 굴러간다. 나는 오히려 본인들이 회삿돈으로 골프 치고 싶어서 법인 골프 회원권 샀고, 그냥 맛있는 음식 먹고 싶어서 호텔 양식집에서 법카 긁었다고 솔직하게 말하는 게 덜 밉다.\n분수에 넘치는 법인 차량이 그다음인 것 같다. 영업해야 하면 법인 차량을 마련하는 건 이해한다. 하지만, 돈도 못 버는 회사가 비싼 외제 차를 법인 차량으로 구매해서 고객을 만나러 가는 영업이 아니라 임원들 출퇴근과 주말에 놀러 다니는 용도로 제공하면 이 또한 이해할 수 없다.\n이 외에 어이가 없었던 건, 아직 한국에서도 헐떡거리고 있는데 해외 지사를 동시에 여러 개 설립하고, 그 지사에 채용할 인재들을 말도 안 되게 높은 연봉을 지급하면서 영입하는 행동들, 그러면서 글로벌 회사가 되려면 이에 걸맞은 글로벌 인재를 영입해야 한다는 단순한 1차원적인 논리를 갖다 붙이면서 이들에게 정말 과한 혜택을 주는 이해할 수 없는 결정들도 몇 번 봤다. 회사는 아직도 비즈니스 모델을 못 찾아서 계속 마이너스가 발생하고, 제대로 사업하라는 의미로 투자한 돈을 이렇게 개념 없이 펑펑 쓰는 걸 보면 이 분들에게 – 우리 포트폴리오든 아니든 – 무슨 말을 어떻게 해줘야 할지 고민된다. 이렇게 기본적인 비용 관리의 개념도 없는 분들이 사업을 도대체 어떻게 하고, 이 책임을 어떻게 감당할지 정말 걱정된다.\n이런 창업가들의 공통점이 있다. 마치 이 돈이 본인이 사업을 잘해서 번 돈으로 착각하고, 남들이 보고 듣는 자리에서 그 자랑을 한다. 그리고 투자받은 돈을 자기 돈처럼 펑펑 쓴다. 도덕성이 없는 건지, 기본 개념이 없는 건지, 아마도 이 두 가지의 어느 중간 지점에서 모두 왔다 갔다 하고 있을 것이다.\n이미 마이너스의 구간을 지나서 회사가 돈을 벌고 있다면 이야기가 조금 달라질 수 있다. 이익이 발생하면 비즈니스 모델을 잡았다는 의미이고, 이 이익을 극대화하기 위해서 돈을 써야 한다면, 내가 봤을 땐 정확히 어디에 돈을 쓰면 어떤 결과물이 나올지 알고 있는 것 같은데, 이런 경우엔 돈 쓰는 걸 그렇게 말리지 않는다. 그런데 이 정도의 사업을 만든 분들이면, 기본적인 비용 개념은 확실히 잡힌 창업가일 확률이 높고, 위에서 말한 이상한 돈지랄을 절대로 하지 않는다. \n창업가들은 남의 돈과 내 돈을 제대로 구분할 줄 알아야 한다. 이건 노력이 필요한 일도 아니고 그냥 기본 상식인데, 의외로 많은 분들이 이걸 잘 못 한다.",
