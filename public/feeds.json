        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing a novel approach to enabling cross-device passkey authentication for devices with inaccessible displays (like XR devices).\nOur approach bypasses the use of QR codes and enables cross-device authentication without the need for an on-device display, while still complying with all trust and proximity requirements.\nThis approach builds on work done by the FIDO Alliance and we hope it will open the door to bring secure, passwordless authentication to a whole new ecosystem of devices and platforms.\nPasskeys are a significant leap forward in authentication, offering a phishing-resistant, cryptographically secure alternative to traditional passwords. Generally, the standard cross-device passkey flow, where someone registers or authenticates on a desktop device by approving the action on their nearby mobile device, is done in a familiar way with QR codes scanned by their phone camera.  But how can we facilitate this flow for XR devices with a head-mounted display or no screen at all, or for other devices with an inaccessible display like smart home hubs and industrial sensors? \nWe’ve taken a  novel approach to adapting the WebAuthn passkey flow and FIDO’s CTAP hybrid protocol for this unique class of devices that either lack a screen entirely or whose screen is not easily accessible to another device’s camera. Our implementation has been developed and is now broadly available on Meta Quest devices powered by Meta Horizon OS. We hope that this approach can also ensure robust security built on the strength of existing passkey frameworks, without sacrificing usability, for users of a variety of other screenless IoT devices, consumer electronics, and industrial hardware.\n\nThe Challenge: No Screen, No QR Code\nThe standard cross-device flow relies on two primary mechanisms:\nQR code scanning: The relying party displays a QR code on the desktop/inaccessible device, which the mobile authenticator scans to establish a secure link.\nBluetooth/NFC proximity: The devices use local communication protocols to discover each other and initiate the secure exchange.\nFor devices with no display, the QR code method is impossible. Proximity-based discovery is feasible, but initiating the user verification step and confirming the intent without any on-device visual feedback can introduce security and usability risks. People need clear assurance that they are approving the correct transaction on the correct device.\nOur Solution: Using a Companion App for Secure Message Transport\nScanning a QR code sends the authenticator device a command to initiate a hybrid (cross-device) login flow with a nonce that identifies the unauthenticated device client. But if a user has a companion application – like the Meta Horizon app – that uses the same account as the device we can use that application to pass this same request to the authenticator OS and execute it using general link/intent execution.\nWe made the flow easy to navigate by using in-app notifications to show users when a login request has been initiated, take them directly into the application, and immediately execute the login request.\nFor simplicity, we opted to begin the hybrid flow as soon as the application is opened since the user would have had to take some action (clicking the notification or opening the app) to trigger this and there is an additional user verification step in hybrid implementations on iOS and Android.\nHere’s how this plays out on a Meta Quest with the Meta Horizon mobile app:\n\n1. The Hybrid Flow Message Is Generated\nWhen a passkey login is initiated on the Meta Quest, the headset’s browser locally constructs the same payload that would have been embedded in a QR Code – including a fresh ECDH public key, a session-specific secret, and routing information used later in the handshake. Instead of rendering this information into an image (QR code), the browser encodes it into a FIDO URL (the standard mechanism defined for hybrid transport) that instructs the mobile device to begin the passkey authentication flow.\n2. The Message Is Sent to the Companion App\nAfter the FIDO URL is generated, the headset requires a secure and deterministic method for transferring it to the user’s phone. Because the device cannot present a QR code, the system leverages the Meta Horizon app’s authenticated push channel to deliver the FIDO URL directly to the mobile device. When the user selects the passkey option in the login dialog, the headset encodes the FIDO URL as structured data within a GraphQL-based push notification. \nThe Meta Horizon app, signed in with the same account as the headset, receives this payload and validates the delivery context to ensure it is routed to the correct user. \n3. The Application Sends a Notification of the Login Request\nAfter the FIDO URL is delivered to the mobile device, the platform’s push service surfaces it as a standard iOS or Android notification indicating that a login request is pending. When the user taps the notification, the operating system routes the deep link to the Meta Horizon app. The app then opens the FIDO URL using the system URL launcher and invokes the operating system passkey interface.\nFor users that have the notification turned off or disabled, launching the Meta Horizon app directly will also trigger a query to the backend for any pending passkey requests associated with the user’s account. If a valid request exists (requests expire after five minutes), the app automatically initiates the same passkey flow by opening the FIDO URL.\nOnce the FIDO URL is opened, the mobile device begins the hybrid transport sequence, including broadcasting the BLE advertisement, establishing the encrypted tunnel, and producing the passkey assertion. In this flow, the system notification and the app launch path both serve as user consent surfaces and entry points into the standard hybrid transport workflow.\n4. The App Executes the Hybrid Command\nOnce the user approves the action on their mobile device, the secure channel is established as per WebAuthn standards. The main difference is the challenge exchange timing:\nThe inaccessible device generates the standard WebAuthn challenge and waits.\nThe mobile authenticator, initiates the secure BLE/NFC connection.\nThe challenge is transmitted over this secure channel.\nUpon UV success, the mobile device uses the relevant key material to generate the AuthenticatorAssertionResponse or AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.\nThe response is sent back to the inaccessible device.\nThe inaccessible device then acts as the conduit, forwarding the response to the relying party server to complete the transaction, exactly as a standard display-equipped device would.\nImpact and Future Direction\nThis novel implementation successfully bypasses the need for an on-device display in the cross-device flow and still complies with the proximity and other trust challenges that exist today for cross-device passkey login. We hope that our solution paves the way for secure, passwordless authentication across a wider range of different platforms and ecosystems, moving passkeys beyond just mobile and desktop environments and into the burgeoning world of wearable and IoT devices. \nWe are proud to build on top of and collaborate the excellent work already done in this area by our peers in the FIDO Alliance and mobile operating systems committed to this work and building a robust and interoperable ecosystem for secure and easy login.\nThe post No Display?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Today, we’re introducing the JetBrains Console, which provides enhanced AI management and analytics for organizations, including new capabilities to manage, observe, and control AI usage and costs across teams.\nAI is no longer an experiment for most development teams. It’s becoming part of the core toolchain. As usage increases, so does the need for clarity. Leaders need to understand how AI is used, how it affects day-to-day work, and how to manage it responsibly in an organization.\nAs a first step, these new capabilities are designed to provide that clarity, with governance and observability built in from the start. We will continue to further develop AI governance functionalities to provide even greater transparency.\nCentralized AI governance across teams\nOrganizations can now use the JetBrains Console to manage AI usage and costs at the company or team level. In the AI settings section, you can:\nEnable AI on the organization or team level.\nControl access to AI tools and agents, including Junie, Claude Agent, and OpenAI Codex.\nManage a shared pool of AI Credits.\nSet default and per-user credit limits.\nConfigure data collection options.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce enabled, AI capabilities are available directly inside developers’ JetBrains IDEs, with no additional setup or workflow changes required. This makes it possible to roll out AI incrementally and avoid ungoverned usage.\n\n\n\n\nManaging AI Credits and licenses\nAs AI usage grows, visibility into licenses and consumption becomes critical.\nThe Users and licensing tab in the AI management section provides a single view of:\nLicense availability and assignment throughout the organization.\nIncluded AI Credit usage.\nRemaining top-up credits.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmins can assign licenses that include AI Credits, such as AI Pro, AI Ultimate, All Products Pack, and dotUltimate, to individual users. Access can be granted or restricted as needed, with changes taking effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\nFor teams or individuals with higher usage needs, additional AI Credit limits can be configured per user or applied in bulk. This allows organizations to support power AI users without removing default values in the company.\n\n\n\n\nObservability into AI usage and adoption\nAI adoption rarely looks the same across teams. Some developers integrate it deeply into their workflow, while others use it occasionally or not at all.\nThe console provides clear visibility into how AI is used throughout the organization, helping you understand adoption patterns and plan budgets better.\nTrack AI adoption and engagement over time\nThe Active AI users chart shows how many developers actively use AI, making it easier to understand adoption trends and engagement levels across teams. You can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nMonitor AI Credit consumption\nAI Credit usage can be analyzed over any time period, both for credits included in your AI license and top-up credits. This data supports more informed planning around budgets and usage limits.\n\n\n\n\nSpot when developers reach their AI Credit limits\nThe console also shows how frequently users reach their monthly AI Credit limits. This makes it easier to identify friction points and adjust limits where needed, whether at the team or individual level.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how AI influences development work\nBeyond usage and cost, the console provides early insights into how AI is used and received by developers. The AI activity and impact charts are intended to support comparison and informed decisions. \nIn upcoming releases, we will introduce more advanced metrics and API access to help organizations assess the impact of AI on engineering and business outcomes.\nAcceptance of AI-generated code\nThe AI-generated code and acceptance rate charts show how often AI-generated code is accepted by developers and act as indicators of quality and relevance.\nYou can use this data to compare the tools or agents you have integrated into AI Assistant (Junie, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and others that will be supported in the future). This helps you identify where suggestions consistently fall short of expectations and decide where configuration, enablement, or tool choice should be revisited. \nYou can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nAI-modified code\nThe AI-modified code charts highlight the relative footprint of different AI tools and features within the codebase.\nThis helps teams understand exactly where AI is making meaningful contributions to development.\n\n\n\n\nAI feature activity\nThe AI feature activity chart shows how developers interact with AI inside the IDE, including chat usage and suggestion volume.\nThese insights help distinguish experimentation from sustained use and identify mismatches between enabled capabilities and actual developer behavior.\n\n\n\n\nGet started\nAI management and analytics are now available at no additional cost to all commercial customers with AI licenses via the JetBrains Console. Access is role-based, allowing organizations to define who can manage AI settings, view usage and adoption data, and assign licenses. \nTo get started, open the AI management section in the JetBrains Console. For more details, refer to the documentation or visit the AI for Business page.\n\n\n\n    \nExplore JetBrains Console now\n                                                    \nWe’re working to further enhance AI management and governance capabilities for organizations. Upcoming features include:\nCentralized Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) management for AI providers.\nMCP management for your organization.\nCentralized codebase indexing (RAG).\nAI guardrails and AI audit.\nMore advanced usage analytics dashboards and API access.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to stay updated on what’s next?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from version 2026.1, IntelliJ-based IDEs will run natively on Wayland in supported desktop configurations. This follows Wayland’s ascendance to the position of primary display server across contemporary Linux distributions.\nBy making this change in our EAP releases first, we hope to be able to give more Linux users the opportunity to try the native Wayland mode in their IDE, gather their feedback, and prepare more comprehensively for the general rollout in one of the upcoming major versions.\nWhat changes?\nInstead of running as X applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs will now automatically enable native Wayland support in a Wayland-capable desktop environment.\n\n\n\n\nSince the last preview in 2024.2, we have enhanced stability across several Wayland server implementations, added drag-and-drop functionality and input methods (IMs) support, and made a significant step towards native-looking window decorations.\nWayland differs profoundly from X11 in several technical ways. As a result, even though the user interface should largely look and feel the same, these underlying distinctions may be noticeable:\nSome windows and dialogs, e.g. Project Structure and Alerts, may not be centered on the screen or keep their previous location. This is due to the window manager having total control over windows’ locations in Wayland, which it is not always possible to override on the application side.\nThe splash screen on IDE startup will not appear as it cannot be reliably centered on the screen.\nSome popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\nWindow decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme.\n\n\n\n\nSome of these distinctions affect many Wayland users across other applications, and the Wayland community is actively addressing them. It is possible that they will be resolved in future versions of Wayland implementations and IntelliJ-based IDEs.\nX11 is still supported\nIn a Linux desktop environment that does not support Wayland, IntelliJ-based IDEs will continue to work as X applications. It is also possible to switch to using X11 on any Wayland desktop because an X.Org implementation called XWayland is always available for compatibility with older applications. To do that, add -Dawt.toolkit.name=XToolkit to the VM options list (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…) and restart the IDE.\nIs my IDE running in X11 or Wayland mode?\nIf you are curious about which mode your IntelliJ-based IDE is currently running in, you can find out by going to the About dialog (Help | About) and checking which toolkit is in use. Click on the Copy and Close button, and you’ll then see the toolkit’s name towards the top of the copied text:\nToolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nThis information is also available in idea.log; for example:\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nConfigurations supported in the future\nWayland support for Remote Development mode is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, Remote Development mode will continue to operate as before and not enable native Wayland support automatically.\nTechnical details\nNative Wayland support is mostly concentrated in one subsystem called WLToolkit. If you were one of the early adopters of this mode, you had to specify the -Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit VM option manually. This will continue to work, but it is no longer necessary.\nThe launcher will supply a new option to the IDE: -Dawt.toolkit.name=auto. The “auto” option will be resolved into either WLToolkit or XToolkit based on the following rule:\nIf wl_display_connect() succeeds, “auto” is replaced with WLToolkit, and therefore the application is launched in the native Wayland mode.\nOtherwise, “auto” is replaced with XToolkit, and the application is launched in X11 mode.\nLike every other aspect of JetBrains Runtime, the platform that powers IntelliJ-based IDEs, WLToolkit is fully open-source. JetBrains is also a key contributor to the OpenJDK project Wakefield, which is dedicated to ensuring that all Java applications execute natively on Wayland. New features and fixes are regularly published to the project’s GitHub repository. \nFeedback\nWe are very grateful for the dedication and valuable input from our users who participated in the Wayland Preview program. The time and effort you invested in reporting issues were instrumental, not only in identifying critical bugs but also in helping us accurately prioritize the roadmap for improvements and the implementation of key features.\nWe are pleased to announce that the upcoming version 2026.1 incorporates fixes for a substantial number of the reported problems. These fixes address a wide range of stability, performance, and desktop integration issues, marking a major milestone in the maturity of our Wayland support.\nThis major platform transition is a work in progress. We are actively investigating and developing fixes, prioritizing core areas like rendering, popups, window management, input methods (IMs), and desktop integration. Please subscribe to and vote for relevant issues for updates. Your patience and feedback are crucial as we work toward a stable, performant, modern, and feature-complete experience.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR:\nThe Kotlin Foundation is launching a mentorship program that pairs experienced open-source maintainers with new Kotlin contributors to help them make their first meaningful contributions, with branded swag and a chance to win a trip to KotlinConf.\nI still remember my first contribution to an open-source library. It was Typhoon, a widely popular dependency injection framework for iOS apps. The easiest part was the actual change. Much harder, but still manageable, was everything that came with it – from onboarding to learning the project structure to figuring out how things were tested.\nWhat required the most effort in terms of emotional energy was something different – deciding that I was worthy of contributing at all. Typhoon was one of the most popular iOS libraries at the time. Most of the apps I knew depended on it. Folks from my community used it daily and considered it a very clever and complex project. I had to convince myself that I was good enough and that I wouldn’t make things worse.\nIronically, I actually did make things worse by introducing a pretty nasty bug. But the world didn’t end. I learned a lot and fixed it later myself!\nThe same thing still happens today to many people who want to make their first open-source contribution. In some ways, it has become even harder, as AI has made the picture worse. It’s now much easier to implement a change without deeply understanding the project and the problem being solved, which has led to a wave of low-quality PRs. As a result, many maintainers have become skeptical about reviewing contributions from outsiders.\nThat’s why we’re launching a new pilot program at the Kotlin Foundation – Kotlin Ecosystem Mentorship. We help experienced project maintainers team up with enthusiasts who want to make their first meaningful contribution, whether that’s code, documentation, or something else. Project maintainers act as mentors. They guide mentees through the full contribution journey – helping to set up the project and understand how the work is organized, reviewing changes, and giving feedback until a contribution is successfully merged. Mentees are expected to work on a real project, ask questions, respond to feedback, and gradually learn how to contribute independently.\nBy the end of the program, each mentor-mentee pair should have at least one meaningful contribution merged into a real project. Ideally, the project also gains a new regular contributor who continues picking up tasks in the future.\nWe’re starting with a small-scale pilot for roughly 10 pairs. It will run from mid-February, when mentor-mentee pairs will be formed, to the beginning of April. We expect it to be relatively lightweight, with mentors spending around 30–60 minutes per week, and mentees around 2–4 hours per week, depending on the task.\nThere’s no formal evaluation at the end. Instead, we’ll collect feedback from both sides. Every pair with a successfully merged meaningful contribution will receive a Kotlin-branded merchandise pack, and one randomly selected pair will win a trip to KotlinConf 2026, with all expenses covered.\nWe know that work on open-source projects is very demanding. The most important asset is people who are motivated to spend some of their time giving back to the ecosystem they rely on. We believe this program can help maintainers pass on not just knowledge but also confidence to a new generation of Kotlin open-source contributors!\nHow to apply\nIf you want to participate as a mentor, please complete this survey. You should be a maintainer of a Kotlin open-source project and be ready to spend some time working with a mentee.\nIf you want to participate as a mentee, please complete this survey.\nFAQ\nQ: What are the requirements for mentees?\nWe don’t impose any hard requirements beyond your willingness to contribute to a project. That said, the program is limited in size, so we unfortunately won’t be able to accept everyone this time.\nQ: Is this limited to code contributions?\nWe accept what we call meaningful contributions – anything that a project maintainer (acting as a mentor) considers valuable for their project. This can include documentation, tooling, examples, or other forms of contribution.\nQ: When will the pairs be formed?\nWe’ll get in touch with participants by February 16, 2026.\nQ: Where can I get more details?\nFeel free to contact us at hello@kotlinfoundation.org or join the #kotlin-foundation channel in the public Kotlin Slack.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We hope you’re staying up to date with our latest posts and have checked out our tutorials on how to create coding agents in Koog and connect ACP-compliant agents to your JetBrains IDE. As useful as these guides are, one important piece was hitherto missing from the puzzle: How do you make your Koog agent ACP-compliant in the first place?\nThis is where Koog’s native integration with the ACP comes into play, providing a streamlined path from agent implementation to IDE integration. Let’s review some basics first.\nWhat is the ACP?\nThe Agent Client Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that defines how agents and clients communicate. Its main uses include notifying the client about things like an LLM’s response or a tool call, or requesting permissions to edit a file. \nACP provides extensive documentation and SDKs for Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Rust, all of which fully implement the agent-client communication layer. As a result, developers don’t need to reimplement protocol logic; they can simply use the already-implemented notifications and request handlers.\nThis significantly reduces the effort required to integrate agents with clients and makes interoperability the default: Any ACP-compatible agent can be used with any ACP-compatible editor or client. Several existing coding agents already follow the ACP and can be easily connected with a wide range of clients, including AI Chat in JetBrains IDEs.\nSo if you want to build your own coding or code-related agent and connect it to an IDE, the first step is choosing an agent framework. And a perfect choice here is Koog.\nWhat is Koog?\nKoog is a Kotlin-based framework for building AI agents that targets JVM, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and in-browser applications. It’s suitable for any kind of agent and provides various ready-made components, including:\nMultiple agent strategies and execution patterns.\nSupport for various LLM providers.\nAgent tracing and state persistence.\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent2Agent protocol) integration.\nA feature mechanism to make the agent extensible.\nWhat’s more, our recent Koog blog post series walks through the entire process of building coding agents from prompt design to tool implementation, making it an excellent starting point for getting familiar with the framework. With that foundation in place, we can now take the next step: applying Koog’s agent-building capabilities to create an ACP-compliant agent.\nHow Koog and ACP work together?\nKoog x ACP integration is built on top of the ACP Kotlin SDK and implemented using Koog’s feature mechanism.\nThe Kotlin ACP SDK provides an API for defining an ACP-compatible agent and for declaring the logic of agent instantiation and execution. \nFirst is AgentSupport, which manages client-agent sessions:\nclass KoogAgentSupport: AgentSupport {\n\n    override suspend fun initialize(clientInfo: ClientInfo): AgentInfo {\n    \t// Client establishes connection with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun createSession(sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client creates a new interactive session with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun loadSession(\n        sessionId: SessionId,\n        sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters,\n    ): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client loads a previous interactive session with the agent\n    }\n}\nThe createSession method must return an AgentSession, which represents a single client-agent interaction. The session begins when the client sends a prompt request, triggering agent execution:\nclass KoogAgentSession(\n    override val sessionId: SessionId,\n) : AgentSession {\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Client sends prompt, agent starts execution and emits notification into the events flow, which are sent back to client\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        // Agent stops execution\n    }\nNow, let’s build a simple Koog coding agent that can read and edit files directly in your project from the IDE. The place to define and run the agent is the prompt method in AgentSession:\n    private var agentJob: Deferred<Unit>? = null\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Define config with agent prompt and model of your choice\n        val agentConfig = AIAgentConfig(\n            prompt = prompt(\"acp\") {\n                system(\"You are coding agent.\")\n            // NB: append client prompt\n            }.appendPrompt(content),\n            model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n            maxAgentIterations = 1000\n        )\n\n        // Register file system tools\n        val toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n            tool(::listDirectory.asTool())\n            tool(::readFile.asTool())\n            tool(::editFile.asTool())\n        }\n\n       // Implement your custom agent strategy\n       val strategy = strategy<Unit, Unit>(\"acp-agent\") {\n            val executePlan by subgraphWithTask<Unit, Unit> {\n                \"Execute the task.\"\n            }\n            nodeStart then executePlan then nodeFinish\n        }\n\n       // Combine everything and run\n       val agent = AIAgent<Unit, Unit>(\n            promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n            agentConfig = agentConfig,\n            strategy = strategy,\n            toolRegistry = toolRegistry,\n        ) {\n            // NB: add ACP feature\n            install(AcpAgent) {\n                this.sessionId = this@KoogAgentSession.sessionId.value\n                this.protocol = this@KoogAgentSession.protocol\n                this.eventsProducer = this@channelFlow\n                // To allow default notifications about basic llm and tool events\n                this.setDefaultNotifications = true\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // To make sure the agent is cancellable, wrap it in a job\n        agentJob = async { agent.run(Unit) }\n        agentJob?.await()\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        agentJob?.cancelAndJoin()\n    }\nHaving AgentSupport and AgentSession implemented, it becomes possible to execute a Koog agent in ACP mode. Try it using the terminal client – you can find an example implementation here.\nBut now let’s move on and try to connect this Koog coding agent to some ACP-capable client, for example, your IntelliJ-based IDE.\nHow to connect the Koog ACP agent to your IDE?\nAll IntelliJ-based IDEs support the ACP. This means you can connect any ACP-compatible agent and use it directly via the AI Chat.\nWhen a new AI Assistant chat is opened, the IDE instantiates the configured ACP agent and connects to it via the built-in ACP client using standard I/O transport. The client processes all notifications and requests emitted by the running agent, displaying them in the chat and reflecting permission requests directly in the IDE UI.\nAn ACP agent can be connected to the 25.3 version of IntelliJ-based IDEs via the ~/.jetbrains/acp.json config file, where the agent run command, arguments, and environment variables should be defined in JSON format:\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to create an agent executable is to package it as an application. To do this, we place the agent entry point in a separate AcpAgentKt file, where STDIO transport is initialized. This transport captures the process’s standard input and output streams and launches the agent connected to the transport, using the previously defined KoogAgentSupport.\nsuspend fun main() = coroutineScope {\n    val token = System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ?: error(\"OPENAI_API_KEY env variable is not set\")\n\n    val agentTransport = StdioTransport(\n        this, Dispatchers.IO,\n        input = BufferedInputStream(System.`in`).asSource().buffered(),\n        output = BufferedOutputStream(System.out).asSink().buffered(),\n        name = \"koog-agent\"\n    )\n\n    val promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(token)\n\n    try {\n        val agentJob = launch {\n            val agentProtocol = Protocol(this, agentTransport)\n\n            Agent(\n                agentProtocol,\n                KoogAgentSupport(\n                    protocol = agentProtocol,\n                    promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n                    clock = Clock.System,\n                )\n            )\n\n            agentProtocol.start()\n        }\n        agentJob.join()\n\n    } finally {\n        agentTransport.close()\n        promptExecutor.close()\n    }\n}\nUsing Gradle, configure the application entry point, then run the installDist task to generate the executable distribution in projectRoot/build/install/coding-agent/bin/coding-agent.\napplication {\n    mainClass = \"ai.coding.agent.AcpAgentKt\"\n}\nProvide this path in the IDE ACP configuration JSON – and voilà! You can now connect your Koog agent to the AI chat and send prompts directly from the UI…and let the agent code for you!\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nYou can find a complete example of the ACP × Koog coding agent here and use it as a template for building your own in-IDE and external assistants. You can implement an agent for any existing ACP-compatible client or build your own client using the ACP SDKs.\nWith the ACP, Koog, and just a few lines of code, you can connect your agent to your web page or desktop application, receive notifications about the agent lifecycle, and surface them directly in the UI.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When people think about tooling for Android development, the conversation often gravitates towards platform-specific concerns: UI performance, layout validation, device compatibility, or resource management. Yet for many Android teams, the most persistent challenges don’t sit at the platform level – they’re in the team’s Kotlin codebase itself.\nAs Android projects scale, Kotlin brings strong language features, but it doesn’t eliminate complexity. Null safety can still be misused, functions grow unchecked, architectural boundaries blur, and code style diverges across teams. This is where Qodana for Android becomes more relevant.\nQodana is not an Android framework tool, and it doesn’t aim to replace Android-specific tooling such as Android Lint. Instead, it focuses on Kotlin code quality, automation, and consistency, which are central concerns for modern Android development.\nIn the past, you might have seen Developer Advocate Anton Arhipov showing users how Qodana works with Kotlin to improve code quality for Android developers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQodana has advanced significantly since then, and the needs of Android developers have grown, too. \nKotlin as the common denominator in Android teams\nAt JetBrains, we’re proud of having created Kotlin. While Kotlin is a powerful, multi-purpose language used for backend development and for building cross-platform applications across mobile, desktop, and web, it’s also widely recognized as the primary language for Android development. That’s why bringing strong code quality tooling like Qodana to Android teams is so important.\nWithin these teams, Kotlin is also used beyond the mobile app itself. Shared libraries, test infrastructure, build tooling, and even backend services are increasingly written in the language.\nThis creates a need for consistent Kotlin standards across different parts of an organization. In practice, however, consistency is difficult to maintain. Local IDE inspections vary, CI checks are often incomplete, and code review standards depend heavily on individual reviewers.\nQodana for Android addresses this gap by allowing Android teams to enforce Kotlin inspections automatically and consistently in CI systems, using the same inspection engine that developers already rely on in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. This alignment is critical. When local feedback and automated checks disagree, developers lose trust in both.\nCreating a CI-first quality gate with code analysis\nMost issues that slow Android teams down are not catastrophic runtime failures. They are incremental quality regressions: overly complex methods, fragile null handling, unused code, or visibility issues that make refactoring harder over time.\nQodana runs Kotlin static analysis as part of the software development lifecycle, shifting quality checks earlier and making them repeatable. Rather than relying on manual code reviews to catch everything, teams can use Qodana as a quality gate that highlights high-impact issues before code is merged.\nThis is particularly valuable for Android projects with multiple modules, long-lived feature branches, or distributed teams. Automated analysis ensures that quality expectations don’t change depending on who reviews the pull request.\nWhat Qodana for Android is, and what it’s not\nIt is important to be precise about what Qodana does in an Android context.\nWhat Qodana for Android does:\nAnalyze Kotlin code used in Android projects\nAutomate Kotlin quality checks in CI\nAlign IDE inspections with automated enforcement\nSupport scalable quality management across teams\nAnalyze project layouts and resources\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Qodana for Android does not do:\nReplace Android Lint\nAnalyze device-specific behavior\nProvide Android framework diagnostics\nQodana can complement existing Android tooling rather than compete with it.\nAutomation and the reality of scale\nAs Android teams grow, review capacity does not scale linearly with team size. Kotlin helps reduce certain classes of errors, but it doesn’t replace the need for disciplined code structure and readability.\nQodana supports this reality through automation. By codifying Kotlin quality rules and running them consistently, teams can remove repetitive review comments and focus human attention on business logic and product decisions.\nThis is not about replacing developers’ judgment – it’s about reserving that judgment for where it adds the most value.\nKotlin quality beyond the Android boundary\nOne of the less obvious advantages of using Qodana in Android contexts is that it does not stop at the Android module boundary. Many Android teams share Kotlin code across mobile and non-mobile components, and maintaining consistent standards across those environments is often challenging.\nBecause Qodana operates at the language and project level, it allows teams to apply the same Kotlin inspections across shared libraries and supporting systems. This reduces fragmentation and helps organizations treat Kotlin as a strategic language rather than a platform-specific implementation detail.\nIn fact, the official Kotlin team even uses Qodana for internal quality and security. \n\n\n\n\nRead Case Study\nPractical quality check adoption for existing Android codebases\nOne of the biggest barriers to adopting stricter quality checks is existing technical debt. Many Android projects are years old, and introducing a new tool that flags thousands of issues is rarely productive.\nQodana is designed to support gradual adoption. Teams can baseline existing issues, focus on preventing new regressions, and incrementally tighten standards over time. This makes it viable for real-world Android projects rather than only greenfield applications.\nThe ability to configure inspections, tailor rulesets, and control enforcement levels is essential for long-term success.\nA Kotlin-centric view of Android development\nSeen through a Kotlin-first lens, Qodana for Android is less about the platform and more about discipline. It helps teams treat code quality as an automated, shared responsibility rather than a manual afterthought.\nFor Android teams working primarily in Kotlin, especially those operating at scale or across multiple domains, this focus is both practical and necessary. Quality issues compound quietly over time, and automation is one of the few reliable ways to keep them under control.\nIncrease quality and security with Qodana\nAndroid development today is as much about managing complexity as it is about building features. Kotlin provides powerful tools, but without consistent enforcement and automation, even well-intentioned teams drift.\nQodana for Android offers a way to bring Kotlin code quality into the foreground of the development process, embedding it into CI and aligning it with developers’ existing workflows. It is not an Android-specific analyzer, but for Kotlin-driven Android teams, that is precisely its strength.\nView Docs\nLet’s talk at KotlinConf 2026!\nJoin JetBrains for the most important Kotlin event of the year and find out how Qodana can help your team boost code quality – right from the source.

Our State of Game Development 2025 report reveals critical insights that provide a clearer picture of where the industry is heading.\nExplore the report\n                                                    \nLayoffs and job security concerns\nThe game development sector has experienced significant turbulence. More than half of industry professionals reported experiencing layoffs within their organizations. This figure is notably higher than in previous years. Job security has sharply declined, placing game developers among the least confident in the tech industry. Studios may need to revisit their organizational strategies, hiring practices, and retention policies to foster stability.\n\n\n\n\nEngine preferences: Unity still leads, but Godot is rising\nUnity remains dominant among indie and mid-sized studios due to its versatility and ease of use. Unreal Engine remains a strong competitor, especially for graphics-intensive projects. However, the most notable trend is the rapid growth of Godot, an open-source engine that has become increasingly popular among indie developers and hobbyists for its flexibility, openness, and community-driven nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform priorities: Mobile and desktop dominate\nIndie developers maintain their focus primarily on mobile and desktop platforms, with Android being the most targeted, closely followed by Windows and iOS. This aligns with the industry’s shift toward platforms that offer wider user bases and easier market entry points compared to traditional consoles.\n\n\n\n\nIDEs and developer tools: JetBrains Rider emerges as a favorite\nIn 2025, JetBrains Rider emerged as the top IDE for indie developers, surpassing both Visual Studio and VS Code. Rider’s robust feature set and seamless workflow integration have made it the preferred tool for daily coding.\n\n\n\n\nPractical AI adoption: From experimental to essential\nAI technology has moved beyond experimentation to become a standard part of game development workflows. Nearly half of developers regularly use AI for feature implementation, and many leverage it for streamlined code reviews. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and JetBrains AI Assistant have become staples in developers’ toolkits, while Junie, JetBrains’ AI coding agent released in April 2025, is quickly gaining popularity. AAA studios show a strong interest in incorporating AI coding agents into their pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the full report to dive deeper into these game-changing trends  and leverage our data to benchmark your studio’s strategies and decisions against current industry standards.\nExplore the report",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you use editor productivity extensions for Visual Studio 2026, there’s good news—they can now load faster! Extension developers with existing MEF-based editor productivity extensions should read this blog to learn about recent changes and how they might be affected. \nWe introduced VisualStudio.Extensibility to simplify the creation of Visual Studio extensions for developers. Previously, handling threads in VSSDK-based extensions was often difficult, requiring knowledge of thread affinity and even the ins and outs of COM just to avoid freezing Visual Studio. The new extensibility model abstracts these technical details away seamlessly. \nDespite this advancement, we recognize most Visual Studio extensions still use VSSDK, so we’re striving to make targeted improvements there as well – especially regarding performance. For Visual Studio 2026, we’ve added the ability to load MEF-based editor extensions on a background thread, which significantly speeds up startup times for users. A major highlight of Visual Studio 2026 is its improved performance, and the proposed change we’re making to MEF is just one of many enhancements planned to make it even faster. We hope you’ll be pleased with the results. \nWhat changed? \nVisual Studio editor components use the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), which requires that objects be constructed in a free-threaded manner. Despite official MEF guidelines, we’ve often loaded components on the UI thread, resulting in many extensions relying on this behavior and limiting our ability to enhance startup performance. \nWith Visual Studio 2026, we’re shifting to a free-threaded model, loading MEF components on background threads. This means extensions with UI thread dependencies might fail to load. We’ve been rigorously testing this approach in recent Visual Studio 2022 updates, and we are aware that some extensions that expect to load on the UI thread will fail to load with this optimization. To support extension developers through this transition, we’ve provided a setting and an analyzer that allows you to experiment with background loading and detect if your extension could be impacted by this change before we push it out more broadly. This initiative reflects our commitment to reducing disruptive changes and help extenders adapt when updates are necessary for the overall improvement of the product. \nDoes it impact my extension? \nTo help extension developers better detect if this change impacts you, we created an analyzer to identify potential issues. We hope that this will give you the opportunity to bring your extension in compliance with MEF rules, so that your extension can also get a startup performance boost like the rest of Visual Studio 2026. \nThe example below shows the analyzer running and reporting access to the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ThreadHelper  and DTE2.StatusBar require UI thread. \n \n To use the analyzer, add a reference to the latest version of the Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers package: \n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers\" Version=\"17.7.98\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\nTo validate your extension can adapt to this change, enable the Preview Feature flag “Initialize editor parts asynchronously during solution load”. \n \nWhen debugging, you may set a breakpoint in MEF part constructors and evaluate System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId. If it’s different than 1, then your code executes on the background thread.  \n \nCall to action \nLoading MEF parts on a background thread is essential for improving Visual Studio’s performance, and we have gradually enabled this change in Visual Studio 2026. We recognize that code changes can be inconvenient, so we’ve made it straightforward to spot and resolve any issues. To see examples of removing UI thread affinity, please see our documentation or a sample PR on how we made this change ourselves.  \nWe want to hear from you! \nThank you for sharing your issues and suggestions with us, and we hope you’ll keep providing feedback about what you like and what we can improve in Visual Studio. For those new and experienced to extending Visual Studio, we invite you to visit our documentation to learn more, or watch the video series on Visual Studio Toolbox where Visual Studio engineers take you through how to build extensions using our samples on GitHub. Feel free to share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones. If you want a closer engagement with other partners in the ecosystem, please visit our GitHub repo to report issues as well. \nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn. \nThe post Performance improvements to MEF-based editor productivity extensions appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

Linear를 선택한 이유는 Opinionated issue tracker이기 때문이다. Opinionated software란 특정 use case에 맞게 purpose-built된 소프트웨어를 의미한다. Linear의 공동창업자 Jori Lallo는 Figma 블로그 인터뷰에서 이렇게 설명한다:\n“We design it so that there’s one really good way of doing things. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.”\n자유도가 높은 도구는 모든 사람이 각자의 워크플로우를 만들어내고, 팀이 커질수록 혼란이 가중된다. Linear는 이슈 상태, 워크플로우, 브랜치 네이밍(gitBranchName), GitHub 연동 방식이 사전 정의되어 있고, 사용자가 이 흐름을 따르도록 유도한다. 이런 설계는 코딩 에이전트와의 통합에 유리하다. 워크플로우가 명확하게 정의되어 있으면, 에이전트에게 “Linear 방식대로 해”라고 지시하는 것만으로 일관된 결과를 기대할 수 있다. 선택지가 많으면 에이전트도 혼란스럽다.\nGitHub-Linear Integration\nLinear와 GitHub 연동은 물 흐르듯 매끄럽다. 몇 가지 규칙만 따르면 별도의 작업 없이 자동으로 동기화된다. GitHub + Linear integration을 설정하면 PR 자동 연결과 머지 시 이슈 상태 동기화가 활성화된다.\n이슈 ID 기반 브랜치 생성\n\nLinear 이슈 화면에서 Copy git branch name 액션을 쓰면, username + issue ID + title 처럼 Linear – GitHub 간 연동을 위한 ID 정보를 포함한 브랜치 이름을 바로 만들어 GitHub에서 쓸 수 있다. 이 포맷은 GitHub 인테그레이션 설정에서 팀 규칙에 맞게 변경 가능하다.\nPR 관리 (이슈  PR 자동 링크)\n\n브랜치 이름이나 PR 제목에 이슈 ID를 포함하면 PR 생성 시 자동으로 Linear 이슈와 연결되고, PR 본문/커밋 메시지에 Fixes ENG-123 같은 “magic word + 이슈 ID”를 쓰면 여러 PR·커밋을 하나의 이슈에 링크할 수 있다.\nMagic Words\n\nPR 본문이나 커밋 메시지에 Fixes ENG-123 같은 형식으로 이슈 ID 앞에 Fixes, Closes, Resolves 같은 magic word를 쓰면 해당 PR/커밋이 머지될 때 Linear 이슈가 자동으로 Done 상태로 변경된다. 여러 이슈를 한꺼번에 닫을 수도 있다.분류Magic words (대소문자 무시)Linear에서의 효과사용처예시Closing (머지 후 Issue 자동 완료)close, closes, closed, closing, fix, fixes, fixed, fixing, resolve, resolves, resolved, resolving, complete, completes, completed, completingPR/MR 머지 시 ‘Done’으로 이슈 상태 변경PR/MR descriptionFixes ENG-123Non-closing / Contributing (참조 링크)ref, references, part of, related to, contributes to, towards머지 후에도 이슈 상태 변경 안됨PR/MR descriptionRelated to ENG-123\n이슈 상태 자동 관리\n\nGitHub PR이 draft → open → merged 로 이동할 때, 팀별 워크플로 설정에 따라 Linear 이슈 상태를 In Progress / Done 등으로 자동으로 옮길 수 있다. PR revert 시 이슈를 다시 여는 동작도 지원한다.\nGitHub Issues 동기화(선택)\n\n필요하면 특정 리포지토리의 GitHub Issues를 Linear 팀과 연결해, 새로 생성되는 이슈의 제목·설명·상태·라벨·assignee·댓글 등을 양방향으로 동기화할 수 있다.\n시도 1: linear mcp를 이용한 이슈 트래커 동기화\nMCP(Model Context Protocol)는 “로컬 세션에서 만든 계획을 Linear에 바로 반영”하는 가장 직관적인 방법이다. 개발자는 Claude Code와 대화하며 구현 계획(체크리스트/작업 단위)을 만들고, 그 내용을 바탕으로 Linear MCP(Multi-Client/Model Context Protocol) 툴 호출을 명시적으로 지시해서 이슈를 생성/갱신한다.\n진행 흐름\n1) 목적/스펙 합의: Claude Code와 대화로 요구사항과 범위를 정리한다.\n2) 구현 계획 작성: 구현 계획을 TODO/체크리스트 형태로 만든다.\n3) Linear 이슈 반영(수동 트리거): linear mcp를 이용하여 지금까지의 구현 계획을 바탕으로 Linear에 이슈를 만들고 업데이트할 것을 지시한다.\n4) 개발 진행 중 동기화(반복): 진행 상황이 바뀔 때마다(작업 착수/PR 생성/막힌 점 발생/완료) 다시 MCP 호출을 시켜 상태/코멘트/체크리스트를 업데이트한다.\nLinear MCP 사용례\nMCP 사용법은 어렵지 않다. 아래와 같이 “어떤 이슈를 어떤 내용으로 만들지/바꿀지”를 구체적으로 기술하여 Tool call을 유도하면 된다.\n이슈 생성: 제목/설명/우선순위/라벨/담당자/팀/프로젝트 등을 포함해 생성\n이슈 업데이트: 상태(In Progress/Done), 설명(계획 상세), 코멘트(결정사항/제약/진행상황) 등을 갱신\n이슈 생성 예시\n지금까지 정리한 구현 계획을 Linear에 반영해줘.\n- 팀: ENG\n- 프로젝트: Agent Workflow\n- 이슈 제목: \"Claude Code Hooks로 Linear 동기화 자동화\"\n- 설명에는 아래 계획을 체크리스트로 포함\n- 우선순위 P2, 라벨: agenticai, tooling\n\n\n\n\n이슈 업데이트 예시\n방금 PR을 만들었어. Linear 이슈에 PR 링크를 코멘트로 남기고 상태를 In Progress로 바꿔줘.\n그리고 문제점(권한 이슈)을 'Blocker' 코멘트로 기록해줘.\n\n\n\n\n이 방식의 문제는 대화를 통해 명시적으로 이슈트래커 동기화 지시를 해야만 한다는 점이다. 개발자는 매 변경점 마다 이슈를 갱신하기 위해 코딩 에이전트와 대화를 해야 한다.\n문제점\n작업 병목: 계획을 세우는 흐름과, Linear에 반영하는 흐름이 분리되어 있어 매 작업마다 “등록/업데이트” 지시가 요구된다.\n누락 가능성: 깜박하고 작업 내역을 동기화하지 않는 등 인간의 실수 개입 여지가 있다.\n일관성 부족: 코딩 에이전트와 대화를 통해 이슈 본문/제목/prefix 등을 기술하다 보면 일관성을 보장하기 어렵게 된다.\n시도 2: CLAUDE.md 및 Sub-Agent 를 이용한 이슈 트래커 동기화 자동화\n이번에는 매번 Linear 업데이트를 지시하는 대신, 계획 단계에서 정리한 내용을 자동으로 등록/업데이트하도록 CLAUDE.md에 규칙을 기술한다.\nCLAUDE.md: 구현 전에 반드시 이슈 트래커를 업데이트하도록 명시하는 규칙 문서\nSub-Agent: 이슈 작성 형식과 예제를 프롬프트에 고정해, 항상 같은 템플릿으로 작성하게 하는 전담 에이전트\n진행 흐름\n1) CLAUDE.md에 동기화 규칙 명시: 구현에 들어가기 전에, 계획 내용을 이슈 트래커에 등록/업데이트하도록 규칙을 박아둔다.\n2) Sub-Agent에 작성 형식 기술: 제목 규칙, 본문 섹션, 라벨/우선순위 등을 Sub-Agent 프롬프트로 템플릿 화한다.\n3) 계획 수립: Claude Code와 대화로 스펙을 구체화하고 구현 계획을 체크리스트로 정리한다.\n4) 구현: CLAUDE.md에 명시된 규칙에 따라 구현에 들어가기 전 이슈트래커에 계획과 진행사항을 갱신한다.\n사용례\nCLAUDE.md 예시\n# CLAUDE.md\n\n## Issue Tracker Sync\n- 계획이 확정되면 항상 \"구현 계획\"을 체크리스트로 만든다.\n- 구현을 시작하기 전에는 항상 구현 계획을 기반으로 Linear 이슈를 생성한다.\n\n\n\n\nSub-Agent 예시\n[You are Issue Tracker Agent]\n- Convert the current plan into a Linear issue update.\n- Title rule: <PREFIX>: <verb> <object>\n- Body sections: Background / Decisions / Alternatives / Checklist\n- Default labels: agenticai, tooling\n- Default priority: P2\n\n\n\n\n문제점\n누락: CLAUDE.md에 규칙을 명시해도, 그 내용이 반드시 실행됨을 보장하지는 않는다. 대화 흐름이 길어지거나 컨텍스트가 여러 번 바뀌면, 계획 → 구현 전환 시점에서 동기화 스텝이 건너뛰어질 수 있다.\n진행사항 반영: CLAUDE.md 만으로는 구현 도중에 발생하는 모든 이력을 이슈 트래커에 반영하도록 제어하기 어렵다. 마찬가지로 누락이 발생한다.\n유연성 부족: 이미 논의된 이슈를 구현하거나, 존재하는 브랜치를 체크아웃 하는 등의 유연성을 워크플로우에 반영하기 어렵다.\nClaude Code Hooks\n위와 같이 특정 작업에 대해 반드시 실행을 보장해야 하는 경우, Claude Code의 Hooks 기능이 해결책이 될 수 있다.\nHook은 Claude Code의 특정 생명주기 이벤트에서 자동으로 실행되는 사용자 정의 셸 명령이다. 대화형으로 LLM에게 요청하거나 사전에 프롬프트로 기재하여 지시하는 방식과는 달리, Hook은 특정 상황에서 특정 동작을 강제할 수 있다.\n다시 말해 Hook은 반드시 실행된다.\n이벤트 발생 → Hook 트리거 → 스크립트 실행 → Exit Code에 따라 진행/차단\nHook은 다음과 같은 문제들을 해결할 수 있다.\n1. 반복 작업 자동화: 파일 수정 후 진행사항 요약, 구현 전에 이슈 및 브랜치 생성 등\n2. 프로젝트 규칙 강제: 특정 명령 차단, 파일 경로 검증, 네이밍 컨벤션 준수\n3. 컨텍스트 자동 주입: 세션 시작 사전에 체크리스트 로드\n예를 들어 PreToolUse 이벤트에 Write|Edit matcher를 설정하면 Claude가 파일을 수정하려 할 때마다 스크립트가 실행된다. 또한 PreCompact 이벤트를 활용하면 컨텍스트 윈도우가 압축되기 전에 현재까지의 작업 내용을 Linear 이슈에 코멘트로 남길 수 있다.\nClaude Code Hook 이벤트 종류\n\n이벤트발생 시점matcher 지원주요 용도\n\nUserPromptSubmit사용자 프롬프트 제출 직후, Claude 처리 전X프롬프트 검증, 컨텍스트 주입, 보안 필터링\nPreToolUse도구 파라미터 생성 후, 실행 전O특정 명령 차단, 민감 파일 보호, 입력 수정\nPermissionRequest권한 다이얼로그 표시 시O특정 도구 자동 승인/거부\nPostToolUse도구 실행 성공 직후O자동 포매팅, 로깅, 결과 검증\nStop메인 에이전트 응답 완료 시X품질 게이트 (lint, test), 작업 완료 검증\nSubagentStop서브에이전트 작업 완료 시X서브태스크 완료 검증, 추가 작업 강제\nPreCompact컨텍스트 윈도우 압축 전X트랜스크립트 백업, 진행 상황 저장\nSessionStart세션 시작 또는 재개 시X개발 컨텍스트 로드, 환경 초기화\nSessionEnd세션 종료 시X정리 작업, 세션 통계 로깅\nNotificationClaude Code가 알림 전송 시O데스크톱 알림, 사운드 재생\n\n\n\n\n\n이때 실행된 스크립트에서 반환하는 Exit Code에 따라 이후 진행을 제어할 수 있다.\n예를 들어 main 브랜치에서 직접 파일을 수정하려는 시도를 감지하면 스크립트가 exit 2를 반환하고, stderr에 “main 브랜치에서는 직접 수정할 수 없습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "영상 편집 프로그램 하나 없어도 문제없어요! 이제는 웹 브라우저만으로도 감성 가득한 로파이 유튜브 채널을 만들 수 있는 시대입니다. AI와 무료 웹 앱을 활용해 단 수십 분 만에 프로급 영상을 제작하는 모든 과정을 지피티팍이 쉽고 자세하게 알려드립니다. 초보자도 바로 시작할 수 있는 감성 채널, 지금 바로 만들어보세요!\n여러분, 혹시 유튜브를 보다가 창가에서 비를 맞으며 공부하는 여학생과 함께 흘러나오는 차분한 로파이 음악 채널을 접해보신 적 있으신가요? 전 세계 수백만 명이 공부할 때나 일할 때, 또는 휴식할 때 틀어놓는 이른바 '로파이 걸' 스타일의 24시간 음악 채널 말이에요. 그런 영상을 보면서 '나도 저런 감성적인 음악 채널을 만들어보고 싶다'는 생각, 한 번쯤 해보셨을 겁니다.\n\n\n하지만 막상 시작하려고 하면 막막하게 느껴지는 게 사실이죠. 프리미어 프로나 애프터 이펙트 같은 무겁고 전문적인 프로그램을 배워야 할 것 같고, 영상 편집 경험도 필수적이며, 심지어 고사양 컴퓨터까지 필요할 거라고 지레짐작하게 됩니다. 솔직히 말씀드리면, 저도 처음엔 그랬습니다. 이런 고정관념 때문에 시작조차 못 해본 분들도 많으실 거예요.\n그런데 오늘, 제가 그 모든 고정관념을 완전히 깨드리겠습니다! 무거운 프로그램을 설치할 필요도 없고, 비싼 컴퓨터도 필요 없습니다. 오직 웹 브라우저 하나만 있으면 여러분도 감성 유튜브 채널의 주인이 될 수 있습니다. 2026년, 기술은 정말 놀랍도록 발전했거든요.\n오늘 이 포스트에서는 AI와 무료 웹 앱만을 활용해서, 영상 편집 경험이 전무한 초보자도 단 수십 분 만에 프로급 로파이 플레이리스트 영상을 만드는 방법을 알려드릴게요. 제가 직접 여러 방법들을 시도해보고 가장 효율적인 과정을 정리했으니, 끝까지 따라오시면 분명 여러분만의 감성 넘치는 음악 채널을 바로 시작하실 수 있을 거예요. 자, 그럼 시작해볼까요?\n✨ 웹 브라우저 기반 감성 채널, 핵심 6단계 로드맵\n강의에 들어가기 앞서, 오늘 우리가 배울 전체 과정을 간단히 소개해드릴게요. 총 6단계로 진행되는데, 생각보다 복잡하지 않으니 너무 걱정 마세요!\n1단계: 구글 제미나이로 로파이 감성 애니메이션 이미지 생성\n2단계: 그록 AI로 정지 이미지를 6초 애니메이션 영상으로 변환\n3단계: 제가 만든 '심리스 루프 스튜디오'로 짧은 영상을 무한 루프 영상으로 변환\n4단계: 역시 제가 만든 '스핀젠'으로 음악에 맞춰 회전하는 CD 영상 제작\n5단계: 'Suno 5.0 Generator GPTs'와 SUNO를 활용해 실제 로파이 음악 생성\n6단계: 업그레이드된 '스펙트럼 스튜디오 프로'에서 모든 요소를 합쳐 최종 영상 완성\n어때요? 이 모든 과정이 웹 브라우저에서 이루어지기 때문에 프로그램 설치가 전혀 필요 없습니다. 다만, 마지막 렌더링 단계에서는 쾌적한 작업을 위해 GTX 1050급 이상의 그래픽카드가 있으면 더욱 좋습니다. 그럼 지금부터 하나씩 차근차근 따라 해 볼까요?\n ️ 1단계: 구글 제미나이로 감성 이미지 만들기\n우리 영상의 배경이 될 첫 이미지를 만드는 단계입니다. 여기서는 구글의 AI인 제미나이(Gemini)를 사용할 거예요. 제미나이는 이미지 생성 능력이 꽤나 뛰어나서 이런 감성적인 배경 만들기에 제격입니다.\n  Tip! 제미나이 채팅창에서 기본 모드 대신 '사고 모드'를 선택하면, '나노바나나 프로'라는 더 강력한 모델을 사용할 수 있어서 훨씬 더 나은 이미지 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다. 이건 꼭 기억해두세요!\n프롬프트는 최대한 구체적이고 감성적으로 작성하는 것이 중요합니다. 예를 들어 이렇게 입력해 보세요:\n\"90년대 감성의 애니메이션 스타일. 따뜻한 분위기의 방 안에서 헤드셋을 끼고 공부하는 여학생의 낭만적인 장면. 필기 중. 16대9 비율\"\n잠시 기다리면 영상과 비슷한 감성적인 이미지가 생성될 겁니다. 마음에 드는 이미지가 나오면 바로 저장해주세요. 만약 한 번에 마음에 드는 이미지가 나오지 않는다면, 프롬프트의 세부 내용을 조금씩 바꿔가며 여러 번 시도해보세요. AI는 명령어를 어떻게 주느냐에 따라 천차만별의 결과물을 보여주니까요.\n  2단계: 정지 이미지를 움직이는 영상으로! 그록 AI 활용\n이제 우리가 만든 정지된 이미지를 살아 숨 쉬는 움직이는 영상으로 만들 차례입니다. 여기서 사용할 도구는 그록 AI(Grok AI)입니다. 그록은 X(구 트위터)에서 제공하는 AI인데요, 이미지를 영상으로 만들어주는 기능이 특히 강력해서 최근 인기를 얻고 있습니다. 무료 사용자도 하루에 6초 영상을 20개 정도 만들 수 있으니, 충분히 활용 가능합니다.\n그록 좌측 메뉴에서 '이미지'를 선택한 후, 제미나이에서 생성한 이미지를 업로드합니다. 그다음 채팅창에 이렇게 입력해 보세요.\n\"고정샷, 필기를 하다 잠시 생각에 잠긴다\"\n여기서 '고정샷'이라고 명시하는 것이 정말 중요해요! 카메라가 움직이면 나중에 영상을 무한 루프로 만들 때 어색해질 수 있거든요. 몇 번의 시도 후에 적합한 영상이 나오면, 우측 상단의 설정에서 '동영상 업스케일'을 선택하여 화질 개선을 진행합니다. 잠시 후에 필름 아이콘에 HD 표시가 뜨면 이제 저장하시면 영상 생성도 완료됩니다.\n⚠️ 주의! 생성된 영상이 항상 여러분이 원하는 대로 완벽하게 나오지 않을 수도 있다는 점을 명심하세요. AI가 아직은 완벽하게 인간의 의도를 이해하는 건 아니거든요. 만약 영상이 마음에 안 드신다면 프롬프트를 조금씩 바꿔가면서 다시 시도해보시면 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는 보통 두세 번 정도 시도하면 꽤 괜찮은 결과물이 나오더라고요.\n  3단계: 6초 영상을 무한 루프로! 심리스 루프 스튜디오\n자, 이제 우리에게는 6초짜리 짧은 영상이 생겼습니다. 그런데 이 영상을 그냥 반복 재생하면 어떻게 될까요? 영상이 끝나는 지점에서 처음으로 돌아갈 때 '툭' 하고 끊기는 느낌이 들 겁니다. 이런 부자연스러운 끊김은 감성 채널의 몰입감을 크게 해치죠. 동일한 영상을 부드럽게 이어주려면 일반적으로 '크로스페이드' 같은 효과를 줘야 하는데, 캡컷 같은 비교적 쉬운 앱에서도 여러 단계를 거쳐야 하니 초보자에게는 당연히 엄두가 나지 않는 작업일 수밖에 없습니다.\n\n\n여기서 정말 유용한 앱이 바로 제가 직접 만든 '심리스 루프 스튜디오(Seamless Loop Studio)'입니다. 이 웹 앱은 무한 루프 영상을 아주 쉽게 만들어줍니다.\n앱을 실행한 후 무한 루프를 적용할 영상 소스를 업로드하고 '구간 분석 시작'을 클릭하면, 전체 구간에서 가장 자연스럽게 이어질 수 있는 끝 부분을 자동으로 찾아주는 '스마트 매칭' 기능이 바로 작동합니다. 그리고 다음 두 가지 옵션도 있습니다:\n강제 오버랩: 영상의 끝 1초 구간을 오버랩하고 크로스페이드를 강제 적용하는 방식입니다. 원본 영상이 스마트 매칭을 적용하기에 불안정한 경우에 사용하면 좋습니다.\n바운스: 영상이 끝까지 재생된 다음 다시 거꾸로 되감기면서 처음으로 돌아가는 걸 반복합니다. 영상 내에 상하좌우로의 명확한 움직임이 없는 고정된 장면에서 작은 움직임이 있을 때 특히 유용합니다.\n두 번째 단계에서 그록 AI로 만든 영상으로 직접 작업해볼게요. 해당 영상을 업로드한 후 '구간 분석 시작'을 클릭합니다. 영상처럼 스마트 매칭으로는 매우 짧은 구간 반복 재생이 되어 적합하지 않을 때가 많습니다.\n이번엔 '강제 오버랩'을 적용해보니, 영상의 끝부분과 시작 부분이 부드럽게 겹쳐지면서 끊김 없는 화면 전환이 이루어집니다. 나쁘지 않은데요?\n마지막으로 '바운스'를 적용해보니, 필기하던 학생이 고개를 들었다가 다시 숙이는 동작이 화면 오버랩도 없이 정말 자연스럽게 반복되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 음, 제 생각엔 이 '바운스' 기능이 이번 영상에는 가장 좋겠네요! '렌더링 시작'을 클릭하면 잠시 후 영상으로 저장됩니다. 정말 놀랍도록 간편하죠?\n\n \n심리스 루프 스튜디오\n \nseamless-loop-studio.vercel.app\n\n \n  4단계: 회전하는 감성 CD 이미지 추가! 스핀젠\n이 단계는 필수는 아니지만, 영상의 완성도를 높이고 감성을 살리는 데 아주 큰 도움이 됩니다. 단순히 배경 영상만 있는 것보다 음악과 어울리는 회전하는 CD 이미지가 있다면 훨씬 더 전문적인 느낌을 줄 수 있거든요.\n\n\n이런 작업을 직접 하려면 포토샵 같은 프로그램으로 앨범 커버를 만들고, 영상 편집 앱으로 회전 기능을 추가하는 등 여러 단계를 거쳐야 하는데, 여간 귀찮은 작업이 아닙니다. 하지만 걱정 마세요! 이 모든 작업을 이번에도 제가 만든 '스핀젠(SpinGen)'이라는 웹 앱이 단번에 해결해줍니다.\n앱을 실행한 후, 앨범 제목, 아티스트 이름, 세부 정보를 우리가 오늘 작업할 '공부할 때 듣기 편한 로파이 음악'과 관련된 내용으로 입력합니다.

분명 중요하고 흥미로운 글인데, 몇 문단 읽기도 전에 스크롤을 내리거나 다른 탭으로 넘어가 버리는 경험 말이에요. 텍스트가 조금만 어려워져도 금세 집중력을 잃고, 결국엔 &ldquo;다 읽긴 읽었는데&hellip; 뭘 읽었지?&rdquo; 하는 허무함에 사로잡히곤 하죠. 솔직히 말씀드리면,&nbsp; 저는 이런 현상이 점점 더 심해지는 것 같다고 느껴요. 긴 에세이, 깊이 있는 보도 자료, 연구 기반의 글들을 마치 SNS 피드처럼 쓱 훑어보고 넘기는 습관이 우리에게 너무나도 익숙해져 버린 거죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저 역시 다르지 않았습니다. 수많은 글들을 북마크에 쌓아두고 &ldquo;나중에 읽어야지&rdquo; 하면서도, 결국엔 제대로 소화하지 못하는 날들이 이어졌죠. 그러다 문득 깨달았어요. 익숙함이 곧 이해는 아니라는 사실을요. 단순히 읽는 행위를 넘어, 진정으로 내용을 내 것으로 만들고 싶다는 갈증이 커졌습니다. 처음에는 더 좋은 노트 필기법을 찾아 헤맸고, 다음에는 구글 NotebookLM이라는 도구를 만났습니다. 그리고 이 도구를 &lsquo;느린 읽기&rsquo;의 강력한 동반자로 활용하기 시작했죠. 이미 수많은 글들을 NotebookLM으로 처리하고 있었기에, 이걸 장문 글에 적용하는 것은 저에게 아주 자연스러운 실험이자 전환점이었습니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  집중력 저하 시대, 왜 &lsquo;느린 읽기&rsquo;가 필요한가요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">생각해 보면, 현대 사회는 우리에게 끊임없이 '빠르게'를 요구합니다. 정보의 양은 폭발적으로 증가하고, 우리는 그 속도에 발맞추지 못하면 뒤처질 것 같은 불안감에 시달리죠. 하지만 정말 역설적으로, 이럴 때일수록 '느리게' 읽는 습관이 더욱 중요해진다고 저는 생각합니다. 빠르게 훑고 지나가버리는 것은 결코 진정한 학습이나 사고의 확장을 가져다주지 못해요. 오히려 미묘한 맥락, 숨겨진 전제, 그리고 깊은 통찰을 놓치게 만들 뿐입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">느린 읽기는 단순히 속도를 늦추는 것을 넘어선, 하나의 <b>사고방식의 전환</b>입니다. 텍스트와 진정으로 대화하고, 저자의 의도를 파고들며, 나아가 나 자신만의 관점을 형성하는 과정이죠. 이 과정에서 필요한 것이 바로 '인내심'입니다. 그런데 이 인내심, 혼자서 기르기 정말 어렵지 않나요?

        "contentSnippet": "넘쳐나는 정보의 홍수 속에서 우리는 점점 더 짧은 집중력을 갖게 됩니다. 길고 복잡한 글 앞에서 쉽게 좌절하고, 피상적인 이해에 만족하곤 하죠. 이제는 달라져야 합니다. 이 글은 구글 NotebookLM을 활용해 '느린 읽기' 습관을 되찾고, 정보의 깊이를 완전히 내 것으로 만드는 혁신적인 방법을 제안합니다. 단순한 요약을 넘어, 진정한 사고의 파트너로서 NotebookLM이 여러분의 지적 성장에 어떻게 기여하는지 함께 탐구해 보세요.\n\n\n혹시 이런 경험 없으신가요? 분명 중요하고 흥미로운 글인데, 몇 문단 읽기도 전에 스크롤을 내리거나 다른 탭으로 넘어가 버리는 경험 말이에요. 텍스트가 조금만 어려워져도 금세 집중력을 잃고, 결국엔 “다 읽긴 읽었는데… 뭘 읽었지?” 하는 허무함에 사로잡히곤 하죠. 솔직히 말씀드리면,  저는 이런 현상이 점점 더 심해지는 것 같다고 느껴요. 긴 에세이, 깊이 있는 보도 자료, 연구 기반의 글들을 마치 SNS 피드처럼 쓱 훑어보고 넘기는 습관이 우리에게 너무나도 익숙해져 버린 거죠.\n저 역시 다르지 않았습니다. 수많은 글들을 북마크에 쌓아두고 “나중에 읽어야지” 하면서도, 결국엔 제대로 소화하지 못하는 날들이 이어졌죠. 그러다 문득 깨달았어요. 익숙함이 곧 이해는 아니라는 사실을요. 단순히 읽는 행위를 넘어, 진정으로 내용을 내 것으로 만들고 싶다는 갈증이 커졌습니다. 처음에는 더 좋은 노트 필기법을 찾아 헤맸고, 다음에는 구글 NotebookLM이라는 도구를 만났습니다. 그리고 이 도구를 ‘느린 읽기’의 강력한 동반자로 활용하기 시작했죠. 이미 수많은 글들을 NotebookLM으로 처리하고 있었기에, 이걸 장문 글에 적용하는 것은 저에게 아주 자연스러운 실험이자 전환점이었습니다.\n  집중력 저하 시대, 왜 ‘느린 읽기’가 필요한가요?\n생각해 보면, 현대 사회는 우리에게 끊임없이 '빠르게'를 요구합니다. 정보의 양은 폭발적으로 증가하고, 우리는 그 속도에 발맞추지 못하면 뒤처질 것 같은 불안감에 시달리죠. 하지만 정말 역설적으로, 이럴 때일수록 '느리게' 읽는 습관이 더욱 중요해진다고 저는 생각합니다. 빠르게 훑고 지나가버리는 것은 결코 진정한 학습이나 사고의 확장을 가져다주지 못해요. 오히려 미묘한 맥락, 숨겨진 전제, 그리고 깊은 통찰을 놓치게 만들 뿐입니다.\n느린 읽기는 단순히 속도를 늦추는 것을 넘어선, 하나의 사고방식의 전환입니다. 텍스트와 진정으로 대화하고, 저자의 의도를 파고들며, 나아가 나 자신만의 관점을 형성하는 과정이죠. 이 과정에서 필요한 것이 바로 '인내심'입니다. 그런데 이 인내심, 혼자서 기르기 정말 어렵지 않나요? 그래서 저는 NotebookLM을 활용해 이 여정을 함께할 파트너를 만들기로 했습니다.\n  NotebookLM, 요약 도구를 넘어선 ‘사고의 동반자’로\n  요약 기계에서 벗어나 깊이 있는 이해로\n많은 분들이 NotebookLM을 ‘빠르게 답을 얻기 위한 요약 도구’로 활용하실 거예요. 문서를 업로드하고, 요약을 요청한 다음, 핵심만 쓱 훑어보는 방식 말이죠. 물론 이런 활용법도 유용하지만, 솔직히 이건 우리가 다른 콘텐츠를 소비하는 성급한 방식과 크게 다르지 않다고 봅니다. 저 역시 그랬고요. 그러다 어느 순간, 이렇게 얻은 지식은 뇌리에 오래 남지 않는다는 좌절감을 느끼기 시작했습니다. 이 경험이 저를 변화시켰어요.\n저는 NotebookLM에 전체 문서를 요약해 달라는 요청을 멈췄습니다. 대신, 제가 인내심을 가지고 장문의 글을 읽는 동안 함께 걸어가는 ‘읽기 파트너’로 대하기 시작했죠. 지름길을 찾는 대신, 목적지에 도달하는 여정 자체를 중요하게 여기는 방식으로요. 목표는 더 이상 속도가 아니었습니다. 요약 과정에서 사라질 수 있는 모든 미묘한 뉘앙스, 숨겨진 의미까지 완벽하게 이해할 만큼 충분히 콘텐츠와 함께 머무는 것. 그것이 저의 새로운 목표가 되었어요.\n\n\n  텍스트 중심 접근: 하나의 글로 하나의 노트를!\n이러한 새로운 읽기 및 학습 시스템을 구축하기 위해, 저는 길거나 까다로운 텍스트 하나당 별도의 NotebookLM 노트북을 하나씩 만들어요. 예를 들어, 경제학 논문 하나를 읽을 때 그 논문만을 위한 노트북을 따로 만드는 식이죠. 이 ‘단일 텍스트 중심 접근’은 생각보다 훨씬 중요합니다. 왜냐하면 이렇게 해야만 글의 맥락을 온전히 유지할 수 있고, 아직 충분히 이해되지 않은 아이디어가 마구잡이로 섞여 혼란이 가중되는 것을 막을 수 있거든요. 하나의 기사나 PDF가 NotebookLM에서 저의 연구와 학습을 위한 지식 기반을 구축하는 출발점이 되는 셈이죠.\n⚙️ 느린 읽기를 강제하는 나만의 맞춤 지침\n제가 NotebookLM을 ‘느린 읽기 파트너’로 활용할 수 있었던 핵심적인 이유 중 하나는 바로 간단한 ‘사용자 지정 지침(Custom Instruction)’ 덕분입니다. NotebookLM의 ‘Configure notebook > Custom’ 메뉴에서 자신만의 지침을 입력할 수 있는데, 제 설정은 대략 이렇습니다.\n\n\n  나만의 NotebookLM 맞춤 지침 예시\n너는 나의 느린 읽기 파트너다. 내가 명시적으로 요청하지 않는 한, 전체 섹션을 요약하지 말 것.\n내가 문단을 붙여넣으면, 그것을 신중하게 바꿔 말해 주고, 전제(assumptions)를 드러내며, 모호한 부분을 강조해 달라.\n결론보다 질문을 우선해 달라.\n이 단 한 가지 지침이 NotebookLM과의 모든 대화 톤을 완전히 바꿔 놓았어요. 때로는 NotebookLM의 속도를 늦추는 ‘과속 방지턱’처럼 작동해서, 제가 텍스트에 더 오래 머물게 해 줍니다. NotebookLM은 제가 잠시 멈춰 서서, 글이 던지는 질문들을 깊이 곱씹어 보도록 만들어요. 덕분에 저는 피상적인 이해를 넘어, 글의 심층적인 구조와 의미를 탐구할 수 있게 됩니다.\n  한 문단씩 뜯어보기: ‘혼란’을 ‘진전’으로 만드는 비법\n✍️ 지름길을 거부하는 탐구적 프롬프트 활용\n첫 번째 읽기에서는 NotebookLM이 제안하는 질문들을 활용해 전체적인 맥락을 한번 훑어봅니다. 중요한 것은 두 번째 읽기부터예요. 정말 복잡하고 어려운 글을 만났을 때, 저는 주요 출처를 선택 해제한 상태에서 한 문단 또는 몇 개의 문단만 NotebookLM에 붙여넣습니다. 이처럼 제한적으로 접근하는 것은 의도적인 전략입니다. 어려운 글은 종종 몇 문장 안에 여러 아이디어를 압축해 담고 있는데, 우리가 너무 빠르게 읽으면 피상적인 해석에 머물러 핵심을 놓치기 쉽거든요. 한 문단씩 천천히 읽으면 자연스럽게 속도가 느려질 수밖에 없습니다.\nNotebookLM의 기본 질문을 그대로 사용하는 대신, 저는 저만의 ‘후속 탐구 질문’을 던집니다. 예를 들어, 이런 식이죠.\n이 문단의 복잡성을 알아차리도록 신중한 독자를 강제로 느리게 만들 다섯 가지 탐구 질문을 생성해 달라.\n이 문단은 독자나 더 넓은 맥락에 대해 어떤 전제를 깔고 있는가?\n이 논증의 어느 부분이 앞선 텍스트의 섹션들에 가장 크게 의존하는가?\n이 문단은 훑어읽을 경우 어떻게 오해될 수 있는가?\n사려 깊은 비평가는 여기서 무엇을 문제 삼을까?\n이러한 프롬프트들은 제 이해의 엄청난 공백을 여과 없이 드러냅니다. 그런데 이게 바로 목적이에요! 질문과 함께 다시 읽을 때, 혼란은 더 이상 실패처럼 느껴지지 않고, 오히려 진정한 진전처럼 느껴지기 시작합니다. 시간이 지나면서 저는 미묘하지만 중요한 변화를 알아차렸어요. 한 문단을 세 번째로 읽을 때는 더 이상 단순히 ‘저자가 무엇을 말하는가?’를 묻지 않고, ‘왜 이런 방식으로 말했는가?’라는 관점에 초점을 맞추게 된다는 점이죠. 저자의 의도와 배경까지 파고드는 겁니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n구분\n빠른 훑어읽기 (Superficial Reading)\nNotebookLM 활용 느린 읽기 (Deep Reading)\n\n\n\n\n목표\n정보의 핵심 파악, 빠른 소비\n맥락, 뉘앙스, 저자의 의도 심층 이해\n\n\n활용 방식\n요약 기능 위주, 자동 질문 활용\n문단별 탐구 프롬프트, 맞춤 지침\n\n\n결과\n피상적인 이해, 빠른 망각\n깊이 있는 지식 축적, 비판적 사고력 증진\n\n\n\n✅ 능동적 마이크로 드릴: 이해를 위한 작은 근육 운동\n  수동적 노트 대신 짧고 집중적인 연습으로\n전통적인 노트 필기 방식, 특히 복잡한 자료 앞에서는 한계를 드러내는 경우가 많습니다. 하이라이트를 아무리 쳐도 쌓이기만 할 뿐, 실제 이해로 이어지지 않는 경우가 허다하죠. 요약 역시 뉘앙스를 죽이고 핵심을 뭉뚱그려 버리기 일쑤고요. 더 나쁜 것은, 단순히 읽거나 훑어보는 것만으로도 ‘내가 이해하고 있다’는 착각에 빠지기 쉽다는 점입니다. 저는 이런 함정을 피하기 위해 새로운 방법을 찾았습니다.\n저는 각 주요 섹션을 읽고 난 뒤, NotebookLM에게 작고 표적화된 ‘마이크로 드릴(Micro Drill)’을 생성해 달라고 요청합니다. 이것들은 전통적인 의미의 학습 보조 도구라기보다는, NotebookLM의 강력한 학습 기능을 활용해 저의 약한 이해 포인트를 초기에 드러내는 역할을 해요. 제가 자주 사용하는 프롬프트는 다음과 같습니다.\n이 논증을 정말로 이해했는지 확인하는 세 문항 퀴즈를 생성해 달라.\n이 섹션을 주장과 이유를 연결하는 “왜–왜냐하면” 사슬로 바꿔 달라.\n하나의 전제가 제거되면 이 섹션에서 어떤 아이디어가 무너질까?\n이 마이크로 드릴들이 정말 효과적인 이유는 그 ‘범위’에 있습니다. 즉시 완료할 수 있을 만큼 짧지만, 동시에 제 이해의 공백을 명확히 드러낼 만큼 충분히 까다롭죠. 만약 막히는 지점이 생긴다면, 저는 억지로 앞으로 밀고 나가지 않습니다. 대신, 마찰을 일으킨 바로 그 문단으로 돌아가 다시 읽으며 문제의 핵심을 파고들어요.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n막히는 부분이 생겼을 때 절대 서둘러 넘어가거나 ‘이해한 척’하지 마세요. 그 부분이 바로 여러분의 깊은 이해를 방해하는 지점입니다. 다시 돌아가 꼼꼼히 확인하고 질문하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요해요.\n제가 직접 만든 퀴즈 프롬프트는 NotebookLM의 기본 퀴즈나 플래시카드 도구와는 다른 결과물을 내놓습니다. 물론 NotebookLM의 기본 도구들도 글 전체를 다 읽은 뒤 최종 점검용으로 사용하기에 가치가 있지만, 제가 만든 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 제 이해도를 점검하고 사고를 강제하는 상호작용형 테스트에 가깝습니다. 덕분에 저는 훨씬 더 능동적으로 텍스트와 씨름하며 지식을 쌓아갈 수 있게 되었어요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. NotebookLM을 요약 도구가 아닌 '느린 읽기 파트너'로 인식하고, 질문을 우선시하는 맞춤 지침을 설정하세요.\n2. 복잡한 텍스트는 한 문단씩 집중적으로 읽으며, 지름길 프롬프트를 통해 저자의 숨겨진 전제와 미묘한 뉘앙스를 파악하세요.\n3. 각 섹션 뒤에 짧은 '마이크로 드릴'을 활용해 능동적으로 이해도를 점검하고, 약한 부분을 즉시 보완하세요.\n4. 결정적인 요소는 '인내심'! 작은 단위로 시작하여 점진적으로 느린 읽기 습관을 길러나가세요.\n이러한 전략을 통해 NotebookLM은 단순한 정보 처리 도구를 넘어, 여러분의 사고를 심화시키고 진정한 지식 습득을 돕는 강력한 조력자가 될 것입니다.\n✨ 느린 읽기는 하루하루 다시 길러갈 수 있는 기술\n이런 방식으로 NotebookLM을 활용한다고 해서 글을 더 빨리 끝내게 된 것은 아닙니다. 아니, 정확히 말하면, 더 빨리 끝내기보다는 글 속으로 다시 돌아오게 만드는 힘을 얻었습니다. 유튜브 긴 재생목록으로 학습할 때도 비슷한 접근법을 사용하고 있는데, 확실히 이해도가 남달라요. 속도를 늦추고, 범위를 제한하며, 더 나은 질문을 끊임없이 던지면, 다시 읽는 행위 자체가 호기심을 자극하고 즐거움을 주는 과정이 됩니다.\n물론, 어떤 AI 도구도 대신해 줄 수 없는 한 가지 필수 요소가 있습니다. 바로 ‘인내심’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하게 모든 글에 적용하려 하지 마세요. 어려운 텍스트를 위해 NotebookLM을 사용해 보고 싶다면, 작게 시작하는 것이 중요해요. 하나의 긴 기사, 그중에서도 하나의 문단, 딱 한 번의 ‘다시 읽기’부터 시작해 보세요. 그것만으로도 2026년 여러분의 깊이 읽는 습관을 재부팅하기에 충분할 겁니다. 새로운 지적 여정을 응원합니다!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: NotebookLM의 ‘느린 읽기’ 방법이 모든 유형의 글에 효과적인가요?\nA1: 아니요, 이 방법은 주로 복잡하거나 깊이 있는 이해가 필요한 장문의 텍스트에 특히 효과적입니다. 뉴스 기사나 짧은 정보성 글에는 일반적인 NotebookLM의 요약 기능을 활용하는 것이 더 효율적일 수 있습니다. 중요한 것은 글의 목적과 자신의 학습 목표에 맞춰 유연하게 적용하는 것입니다.\nQ2: NotebookLM 맞춤 지침을 설정하는 것이 정말 큰 차이를 만드나요?\nA2: 네, 예상보다 훨씬 큰 차이를 만듭니다. 맞춤 지침은 NotebookLM이 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 정보를 처리하고 응답하도록 유도하여, 단순한 답변을 넘어 사고를 촉진하는 파트너 역할을 수행하게 합니다. ‘질문을 우선해 달라’는 지침이 특히 효과적이에요.\nQ3: ‘마이크로 드릴’이 전통적인 퀴즈와 다른 점은 무엇인가요?\nA3: 마이크로 드릴은 짧고 특정 섹션에 집중하며, 정답을 맞히기보다 이해의 공백을 드러내고 사고를 유도하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 전통적인 퀴즈가 전체적인 지식 점검이라면, 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 미묘한 이해 부족을 파고드는 ‘근육 운동’에 가깝습니다.\nQ4: ‘느린 읽기’ 습관을 들이는 데 가장 중요한 것은 무엇인가요?\nA4: 가장 중요한 것은 ‘인내심’과 ‘작게 시작하는 용기’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하려 하기보다, 작은 성공 경험을 통해 점진적으로 습관을 확장해 나가는 것이 중요해요. 혼란을 실패로 여기지 않고, 더 깊이 파고들 기회로 삼는 태도가 필요합니다.\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"NotebookLM의 ‘느린 읽기’ 방법이 모든 유형의 글에 효과적인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"아니요, 이 방법은 주로 복잡하거나 깊이 있는 이해가 필요한 장문의 텍스트에 특히 효과적입니다. 뉴스 기사나 짧은 정보성 글에는 일반적인 NotebookLM의 요약 기능을 활용하는 것이 더 효율적일 수 있습니다. 중요한 것은 글의 목적과 자신의 학습 목표에 맞춰 유연하게 적용하는 것입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"NotebookLM 맞춤 지침을 설정하는 것이 정말 큰 차이를 만드나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 예상보다 훨씬 큰 차이를 만듭니다. 맞춤 지침은 NotebookLM이 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 정보를 처리하고 응답하도록 유도하여, 단순한 답변을 넘어 사고를 촉진하는 파트너 역할을 수행하게 합니다. ‘질문을 우선해 달라’는 지침이 특히 효과적이에요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"‘마이크로 드릴’이 전통적인 퀴즈와 다른 점은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"마이크로 드릴은 짧고 특정 섹션에 집중하며, 정답을 맞히기보다 이해의 공백을 드러내고 사고를 유도하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 전통적인 퀴즈가 전체적인 지식 점검이라면, 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 미묘한 이해 부족을 파고드는 ‘근육 운동’에 가깝습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"‘느린 읽기’ 습관을 들이는 데 가장 중요한 것은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"가장 중요한 것은 ‘인내심’과 ‘작게 시작하는 용기’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하려 하기보다, 작은 성공 경험을 통해 점진적으로 습관을 확장해 나가는 것이 중요해요. 혼란을 실패로 여기지 않고, 더 깊이 파고들 기회로 삼는 태도가 필요합니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `<Activity />` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등 v19에서 도입된 주요 기능들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/3-ways-to-build-forms-in-react)\r\r\n* [Building Reusable Components with

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Rust 전환 시 기존 대비 10-100배의 성능 향상이 가능하기 때문에, 복잡해진 프론트엔드 생태계에서 이 흐름은 이제 거스르기 어려워 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n가장 두드러진 성과를 내는 곳은 VoidZero로 보입니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다. '이게 좋다' 하면 모두가 몰려가고, '저게 정답이다' 하면 또 그쪽으로 쏠리는 흐름이 반복됐습니다. 그 와중에 인상 깊었던 LLM 사용 사례와 아티클, 도구를 정리해 공유합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI 코딩의 한계와 책임\r\r\n\r\r\nLLM 기반 개발의 한계점과 개발자 책임에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to \"write better code?\"](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)\r\r\n* [Why you shouldn't use AI to write documentation](https://zeroheight.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-documentation/)\r\r\n* [Why Your AI Coding Assistant Keeps Doing It Wrong, and How To Fix It](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)\r\r\n* [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\r\r\n* [dead framework theory](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/)\r\r\n* [How to Fix Any Bug](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기업 도입 사례\r\r\n\r\r\nSpotify, Airbnb 등 대규모 조직의 AI 도입 경험입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1,500+ PRs Later: Spotify’s Journey with Our Background Coding Agent (Part 1)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/spotifys-background-coding-agent-part-1)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b)\r\r\n\r\r\n### MCP와 컨텍스트 엔지니어링\r\r\n\r\r\nModel Context Protocol과 효과적인 AI 활용을 위한 컨텍스트 설계입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [MCP explained without hype of fluff](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/12/mcp-explained-without-hype-or-fluff)\r\r\n* [Chrome DevTools MCP Server](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp)\r\r\n* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\r\r\n* [Minification isn't obfuscation - Claude Code proves it](https://martinalderson.com/posts/minification-isnt-obfuscation-claude-code-proves-it/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI시대의 개발 방법론\r\r\n\r\r\nAPI 설계, 문서화, 추상화 등 AI와 함께하는 개발 방법론입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Design APIs for an AI World ](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world)\r\r\n* [Writing documentation for AI: best practices](https://docs.kapa.ai/improving/writing-best-practices/)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Conversation: LLMs and Building Abstractions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html)\r\r\n* [Attention Is the New Big-O](https://alexchesser.medium.com/attention-is-the-new-big-o-9c68e1ae9b27/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 유용한 도구\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 개발에 활용할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) - 전체 Repository를 AI 친화적인 단일 파일로 압축\r\r\n* [repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt) - GitHub Repository를 단일 텍스트로 변환, GUI 기반으로 파일 선택 가능\r\r\n* [ai-digest](https://github.com/khromov/ai-digest) - 코드베이스를 하나의 마크다운 파일로 생성\r\r\n* [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) - Claude 기반 AI 에이전트를 여러 개 연결해 협업, 복잡한 작업을 단계별 워크플로우로 자동화\r\r\n* [agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules) - Cursor, Claude Code 같은 AI 코드 어시스턴트에게 일관된 행동 지침을 적용하는 규칙 템플릿 모음\r\r\n* [Conductor](https://conductor.build/) - Claude Code를 여러 개 동시에 실행하며 관리하는 도구\r\r\n* [Terragon](https://www.terragonlabs.com/) - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex 등 AI 코딩 에이전트를 클라우드에서 병렬 실행\r\r\n* [react-grab](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) - 페이지의 모든 요소를 선택해 AI 코딩 에이전트에게 컨텍스트로 전달, 단일 스크립트 태그로 설치\r\r\n* [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) - GitHub에서 다양한 MCP 서버를 모아둔 레지스트리\r\r\n* [streamdown](https://streamdown.ai/) - AI Chat 서비스처럼 마크다운 스트리밍 렌더링 지원\r\r\n* [lean-spec](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec) - 경량 SDD(Spec-Driven Development) 프레임워크\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그 외 분야별 소식\r\r\n\r\r\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년도 JavaScript와 TypeScript 생태계는 활발하게 움직였습니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "올해는 여러 가지 거시적인 수치나 분위기를 봤을 때 작년보다는 벤처 시장이 좋아지지 않을지 나는 개인적으로 조심스럽게 예상한다. 아직 호황기와는 거리가 멀지만, 그래도 지금 창업하는 분들은 지난 3년 동안 창업했던 분들보단 덜 쪼들리면서 사업을 할 수 있을 것 같다.\n우리는 워낙 포트폴리오가 많아서 항상 잘 되는 회사보단 힘든 회사가 더 많은데, 특히나 지난 3년 동안 어둡고 어두운 터널 속에서 길을 잃은 회사가 그 어느 때보다 많았다. 며칠 전에 아주 오래된 우리 포트폴리오 대표님과 정말 힘든 대화를 나눴던 미팅을 했다. 둘 다 바빠서 오후 6시에 우리 사무실 구글캠퍼스에서 간단하게 저녁을 배달시켜서, 먹으면서 working dinner를 했는데, 이날의 느낌이 내 안에 오랫동안 남아서 – 마치 트라우마처럼 – 이 상처를 떨치기 위해 글로 한 번 적어본다.\n아주 오랫동안 사업을 한 회사인데 그동안 성장은 없었고, 돈은 다 까먹었고, 공동창업자를 포함한 많은 직원도 회사를 떠났다. 돈이 없다 보니 대표이사가 개인적으로 대출받아서 회사에 가수금을 너무 많이 집어넣었고, 지인들에게도 손을 내밀어 돈을 빌렸고, 부모님과 처가댁을 비롯한 가족들에게도 돈을 빌렸다. 그럼에도 회사는 단 한 번도 돈을 벌어본 적이 없고 이젠 세금과 4대 보험이 밀리는 상황까지 왔다. 협력업체에 지급할 비용도 밀렸고, 투자자들에게 빌린 돈도 다 까먹었다. 나는 이 창업자가 현실을 똑바로 직시하지 못한다고 생각했고, “조금만 더하면 잘될 거다”라는 비현실적인 희망 고문을 스스로에게 하고 있다고 생각했다. 하루이틀도 아니고 수년 동안 이 회사를 옆에서 봤던 터라 이날 나는 이분에게 여기서 그냥 접는 게 맞지 않냐고 강하게 말했다.\n실은, 과거에 사업 그만하라는 내 조언을 반대하고 계속 사업을 해서 잘 된 경우도 많았기 때문에 이런 말을 하는 게 꽤 조심스럽긴 했지만, 우리 투자금 손실은 이미 확실한 이 시점에서 이 분이 너무 힘들게 사는 게 안타까웠다. 사업하면서 온갖 고생 다 했고, 온갖 정신병을 다 얻었는데, 그냥 이제 조금은 더 편안하게 인생을 살았으면 하는 마음에서 이런 말을 했다. 그런데 여전히 내 앞에 있는 이 창업가는 아직도 조금만 더 하면 잘될 거라고 믿고 있어서스스로에게 주문을 외우는 것 같아서, 정신 좀 차리라고 조금 세게 말했다.\n그러자 이 분은 울음을 터뜨리고 말았다. 그러면서 실은 너무너무 불안하고, 너무너무 힘들고, 뭘 어떻게 해야 할지 모르겠다고 이야기하면서 계속 울었다. 그 순간부터 나도 밥이 입으로 들어갔는지, 내가 밥을 다 먹었는지 기억이 잘 안 난다.\n거의 8시가 돼서 미팅은 끝났고, 이 분은 다시 사무실로 돌아갔다. 나는 조금 전까지 우리가 이야기했던 미팅룸으로 다시 돌아와서 앉았다. 앉자마자 눈물이 찔끔 났다.\n인생을 걸고 모든 것을 바친 창업가들에게 내가 뭔데 사업을 그만하라고 해서 이들을 울게 만드는 걸까? 이분들은 편안하게 인생을 살 수도 있는데 왜 굳이 이런 고생을 사서 할까? 무엇이 이 창업가들을 이렇게 극한 상황으로 밀어붙였을까? 나는 뭐 하는 사람인가? 등,,,온갖 생각이 머릿속을 맴돌았다.\n난 잘 안 운다. 그런데 이 추운 날 밤만큼은 모두 다 퇴근한 썰렁한 구글캠퍼스에서 울고 싶었다. 힘들어하는 모든 창업가들을 위해서, 그리고 이들을 가끔은 몰아붙여야 하는 나를 위해서.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "침몰하는 일본 경제에 대한 비판을 소신 있게 하는 것으로 유명한 일본의 경제학자 노구치 유키오의 “일본이 선진국에서 탈락하는 날”을 작년말에 매우 흥미롭게 읽었다. 한때 전 세계 최강국이었던 일본이 어떤 내, 외적 요소 때문에 침몰하고 있는지, 그리고 일본의 정치인과 기업인이 어떻게 연속적으로 잘못된 결정을 하면서 이 실수가 차곡차곡 쌓여서 일본이 선진국에서 탈락했는지에 대한 다소 주관적이지만, 나는 어느 정도 공감했던, 그런 분석이 주된 내용이다.\n흥미롭게 읽긴 했지만, 한편으로는 바짝 긴장하면서 읽었다. 왜냐하면, 일본이 갔던 이 내리막길을 한국이 그대로 갈 수도 있다고 생각했기 때문이다. 하지만, 책을 다 읽고 덮은 후 내 개인적인 생각을 좀 공유하자면, 한국은 일본같이 쉽게 선진국에서 탈락하진 않을 것 같다.(물론, 한국이 현재 선진국인가에 대해서는 찬반이 갈리지만). 하지만, 우리는 일본과는 여러 가지 면에서 같기도 하지만 시스템 자체가 다르고, 정치인들도 병신도 많지만, 꽤 괜찮은 사람도 있고, 가장 중요한 건, 일본인과 한국인은 근본적으로 다르기 때문에 – 물론, 한국인이 모든 면에서 월등하다고 생각한다 – 오히려 한국의 장래는 밝다고 생각한다.\n이 책을 재미있게 읽었던 또 다른 이유는 저자인 노구치씨가 한국에 대한 이야기를 상당히 많이 했는데, 모두 다 한국을 칭찬하는 긍정적인 내용이었고, 평소의 내 생각과 크게 다르지 않았기 때문이다. 한국이 어떻게 일본을 상대적으로 단기간에 따라잡았으며, 일단 선진국의 반열에 오르면 – 책이 써진 시점에는 아직 안 올랐지만, 지금은 이미 우리는 선진국이라고 생각한다 – 왜 일본같이 쉽게 탈락하지 않을지에 대한 노구치씨의 생각을 한번 정리해 보면 다음과 같다.\n이 분은 한국의 성장에 크게 기여한 사건으로 1990년대 말 아시아통화 위기를 손꼽는다. 흔히 우리가 말하는 IMF 사건이다. 1997년도에 태국의 바트가 폭락하면서 한국을 비롯한 아시아 각국의 통화도 폭락했는데, 이때 한국의 재벌 기업이 줄지어 도산하고 금융 시스템이 붕괴하면서 우리나라는 거의 망할뻔했다. 어쩔 수 없이 IMF의 도움을 받아야 했는데, 그 대가로 IMF의 깐깐한 관리 체제하에 놓이게 됐다.\n일본도 이때 큰 경제위기를 겪었지만, 이 위기 상황에 대처하는 방식이 한국과는 판이했다. 노구치씨의 의견에 의하면 이때 한국은 뼈와 살을 깎는 노력으로 체질을 완전히 개선하는 동시에 탄탄한 기초체력을 만든 반면, 일본은 눈앞에 보이는 위기에만 대처하느라 선진국과는 점점 더 멀어졌다는 것이다. 한국은 IMF 관리를 계기로 경제인과 정치인뿐만 아니라 전 국민 사이에 강한 위기의식이 생겼다. IMF 관리 체제를 벗어나기 위해서는, 기업은 돈을 벌어서 수익성과 생산성을 개선해야 하고, 정부와 기업은 빠른 글로벌화를 해야지만 이 위기를 극복할 수 있다는 데 동의했다. 그리고 위기 극복의 열쇠는 한국인 전원의 인적 능력 향상이라는 점에도 동의했다. 이 점에 착안하여 좋은 인재를 배출하는 대학교의 교육, 연구 능력과 학생 전원의 영어 실력을 갈고닦는데 한국 정부, 기업, 학교는 집중적으로 투자했다. 이 모든 것을 한국인 특유의 앞만 보고 밀어붙이는 방식으로 했기 때문에 단시간 내에 글로벌화의 발판을 만들 수 있었고, 졸업하기 어렵다는 IMF의 관리에서 조기졸업 하는 놀라운 성과를 만들어냈다.\n아마도 이런 위기의식과 애국심 때문에 온 국민이 나라 살리기 운동의 하나로 그 유명한 금 모으기 운동까지 한 게 아닐까 생각한다. 지금 생각해 보면 정말 한국이기에 할 수 있었고, 한국만이 할 수 있는, 개인적으로도 너무 뿌듯하고 자랑스러운 운동이라고 생각한다.\n노구치씨는 글로벌화에 있어서 가장 중요한 영어에 대해서도 한국을 칭송한다. 이 분과 비슷한 세대 한국인들의 영어 실력은 정말 형편없었지만, 지금은 상황이 완전히 바뀌었다고 한다. TOEFL 점수를 보면 한국은 아시아 국가 중 10위 안인데, 이는 영어를 공용어로 사용하는 홍콩과 거의 비슷한 수준이다. 물론, 시험 점수가 그렇다는 것이고, 실제 영어를 일상생활에서 구사하는 실력은 홍콩이 한국보다 훨씬 높다. 일본은 아시아 29개국 중 27위로 거의 꼴찌인데 일본 정부, 기업 또는 국민들은 크게 개의치 않는 것 같다. 그만큼 일본은 글로벌화에 대해서는 크게 신경 쓰지 않거나 포기했다는 게 이 분의 주장이다.\n책을 다 읽고 생각해 봤는데, 실은 한때 미국보다 더 잘 살던 세계 최강국 일본과 우리가 비교당하는 것 자체가 대단한 영광이라고 생각한다. 한국은 한때 세계에서 가장 가난한 나라였는데 이젠 전 세계의 문화에 영향을 미치는 global cultural power가 됐다. 이 작은 나라가 전 세계에서 가장 좋은 차를 만들고, 가장 좋은 가전제품을 만들고, 가장 좋은 배를 만들고, 가장 좋은 핸드폰을 만들고, 가장 좋은 반도체를 만들고, 가장 좋은 화장품을 만들고, 가장 좋은 콘텐츠를 만든다는 사실을 우리 모두 잘 알고 있지만, 이게 의미하는 바를 곰곰이 생각해 보면 정말 엄청나다.\n우리는 여기서 과연 어디까지 더 올라갈 수 있을까?\n많은 분이 한국은 이제 끝났고, 일본과 같이 선진국에서 탈락할 것이라고 말하지만, 내 생각은 그 반대다. 나는 한국은 이제 막 시작했고, 훨씬 더 높이 오를 수 있다고 믿고 있다. 물론, 쉽진 않을 것이다. 그 어느 때보다 우리 앞에는 도전적이고 복잡한 장애물과 과제가 놓여 있고, 하나라도 잘못되면 우린 한 방에 다시 최빈국이 될 수도 있을 것이다. 하지만 과거가 미래에 대한 힌트를 줄 수 있다면, 우린 이미 수많은 어려움을 극복했고, 그 어려움으로부터 배움을 얻는 과정을 너무 많이 겪어서, 점진적 개선에 최적화된 민족이다. 내 이전 세대가 열심히 일했듯이, 우리 세대도 열심히 일하고 있고, 우리 다음 세대도 열심히 일할 것이라고 나는 믿는다. 우리 그 누구도 한국이 일본처럼 선진국에서 탈락하는 걸 보고 싶지도 않고, 경험하고 싶지도 않을 것이다. 그러려면 정말 열심히 일해야 하고, 여기에서 더 높이 올라가고 싶다면 더욱더 열심히 일해야 한다.\n이 글을 읽고 또 여러 가지 부정적인 댓글이 많이 달릴 건데 나는 상관없다. 열심히 일하기 싫으면 하지 말아라. 그건 본인의 자유다. 대신, 주변에 열심히 살려고 하는 사람들을 욕하지 말고, 이들을 방해하지 말았으면 한다.",

4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}대학 스포츠에서 출발한\n아메리칸 풋볼의 탄생\n아메리칸 풋볼의 뿌리는 19세기 말 미국 유수의 명문 대학들이 모여 있는 아이비리그에서 시작되었습니다. 1869년 러트거스 대학과 프린스턴 대학의 경기로 거슬러 올라가는 이 스포츠는 1880년대 예일 대학의 코치 월터 캠프가 스크리미지 라인*과 다운 시스템** 같은 현대적 규칙을 정립하며 본격적인 틀을 갖추게 됩니다.\n*공격과 수비 팀이 대치하는 가상의 선\n** 공격팀이 4번의 기회 안에 10야드(약 9m) 이상 전진해야 공격권을 유지하는 규칙\n흥미로운 점은 아메리칸 풋볼이 보여주는 철저한 포지션 분화입니다. 각자의 역할이 명확히 나뉘고 전술적 협업이 필수적인 이 종목은 미국을 세계 최고의 산업 강대국으로 키운 분업화의 상징으로 자리 잡으며 미국인의 정체성에 깊이 스며들었습니다.\n대학 풋볼의 인기가 높아지면서 1920년에는 프로 리그가 탄생했고, 1922년부터는 NFL이라는 이름을 사용하게 됩니다. 본격적인 전환점은 1960년대였습니다. 1960년 AFL(아메리칸 풋볼 리그)이라는 경쟁 리그가 등장하며 치열한 선수 영입 경쟁이 벌어졌고, 결국 1966년 NFL과 AFL은 합병에 합의하게 됩니다. 이 합병의 결과로 1967년, 첫 슈퍼볼이 열렸습니다.\n슈퍼볼이라는 명칭은 1968년 2회 대회부터 사용됐습니다. 캔자스시티 치프스의 구단주 라마 헌트가 딸이 가지고 놀던 탱탱볼(Super Ball)에서 영감을 받아, Ball과 발음이 비슷한 Bowl을 붙여 사발 모양 경기장을 표현한 것이죠. 이 재치 있는 제안은 그대로 받아들여졌고, 지금은 세계에서 가장 유명한 스포츠 이벤트 이름이 됐습니다.\n\n미국 대학 스포츠에서도 최고의 인기를 자랑하는 대학 풋볼 리그 / 사진: Reuters\nNFL이 추구하는\n최대 다수의 최대 행복\nNFL이 압도적인 인기를 유지할 수 있었던 비결은 평등에 기초한 리그 설계에 있습니다. 1994년부터 시행된 하드 샐러리캡(연봉 총액 상한제)은 특정 부자 구단이 우수한 선수를 독점하지 못하도록 원천적으로 차단했습니다.\n엄격한 전력 균형 덕분에 팬들은 “우리 팀도 언제든 우승할 수 있다”는 희망을 품게 됐고, 실제로 하드 샐러리캡 도입 이후 슈퍼볼 3연패를 달성한 팀은 단 한 곳도 나오지 않았습니다. 철저한 하드 샐러리캡 시스템은 팬층의 고른 분포로 이어졌고, 2025년 기준 리그 전체 티켓 판매율 97.6%라는 놀라운 기록을 만들어냈습니다.\n2025년 홈구장 평균 관중 1위 팀은 댈러스 카우보이스로 약 9만 3,000명을 기록했고, 최하위 시카고 베어스도 약 5만 8,000명을 기록했습니다. 하지만 댈러스의 홈구장 수용 인원이 10만 명, 시카고가 6만 2,500명이라는 점을 감안하면 두 팀 모두 경기장을 거의 가득 채운 셈입니다. 격차는 팬덤의 차이라기보다 경기장 규모의 차이에서 비롯된 결과였죠.\n\n평균 관중 1위 팀 댈러스 카우보이스가 홈구장으로 사용하는 AT&T 스타디움 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\n슈퍼볼 광고비가\n천문학적으로 오르는 이유\n슈퍼볼의 가치를 가장 직관적으로 보여주는 지표는 단연 광고비입니다. 1967년 첫 대회 당시 4만 달러 수준이었던 30초 광고비는, 2025년 평균 800만 달러(약 117억 5,000만 원)까지 치솟았습니다. 총 광고시간이 약 51분에 달한다는 점을 고려하면 전체 광고비는 1조 2,000억 원에 이릅니다.\n2025년 슈퍼볼 시청자 수는 1억 2,771만 명이었습니다. 이는 1967년 2,443만 명에 비해 약 6배 가까이 늘어난 수치죠. 단일 경기로는 UEFA 챔피언스리그 결승전에 이어 두 번째로 많은 시청자를 기록한 이벤트이기도 합니다.\n\n하지만 단순히 시청자 수만으로는 슈퍼볼 광고비의 비밀을 설명하기 어렵습니다. 챔피언스리그 결승전보다 시청자는 적지만, 광고비는 훨씬 비싸기 때문이죠. 슈퍼볼 광고가 비싼 진짜 이유는 시청자들이 광고를 집중해서 찾아본다는 점에 있습니다. 일반 스포츠 경기에서는 광고 시간에 자리를 비우는 경우가 많지만, 오히려 슈퍼볼에서는 광고만 보기 위해 TV 앞에 앉는 사람들도 적지 않을 정도죠.\n슈퍼볼 광고가 주목받기 시작한 건 리들리 스콧 감독이 연출한 애플의 '1984' 광고를 선보인 1984년부터입니다. 조지 오웰의 소설을 모티브로 IBM 독점 시장에 도전장을 내민 이 광고는 단순한 제품 홍보를 넘어 하나의 예술 작품으로 평가받았고, 이후 슈퍼볼 광고는 기업들이 창의성과 사회적 메시지를 겨루는 격전장이 되었습니다.\n\n역사상 가장 영향력 있는 광고로 평가받는 애플의 1984 광고 스틸컷\n슈퍼볼 광고가 이처럼 특별해진 데는 구조적 요인도 작용했습니다. 먼저 시청자 대부분이 미국인이라는 점입니다. 참여하는 60여 개 업체에게 슈퍼볼은 미국 시장을 공략할 수 있는 1년에 단 한 번뿐인 골든타임이죠. 게다가 하프타임이 약 30분으로 길어 광고 시간도 충분합니다. 무엇보다 광고 자체가 문화적 이벤트가 되었습니다. 슈퍼볼 다음날 언론과 소셜미디어에서 '올해 최고의 슈퍼볼 광고'로 회자되면 그 자체로 엄청난 추가 홍보 효과를 얻으니까요.\n이런 환경 속에서 광고주들은 더 화려한 스케일과 더 높은 실험성으로 시청자들의 기억에 남기 위해 경쟁합니다. 영상미가 떨어지거나 스토리가 부족한 광고는 금세 잊히기 때문에, 기업들은 수백억 원을 투자해서라도 최고의 작품을 만들려고 합니다. 그 결과 광고의 완성도는 계속 높아지고, 시청자들의 집중도 역시 함께 올라가게 됩니다. 그리고 이 흐름은 지속적인 광고비 상승으로 이어지고 있습니다.\n전 세계가 열광하는\n슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼\n미국에서 당대 최고의 뮤지션으로 인정받으려면, 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼 출연 경력이 있어야 한다는 말이 있습니다. 마이클 잭슨, 롤링 스톤즈, 폴 매카트니, 레이디 가가, 비욘세 등 전설적인 스타들은 모두 이 무대를 거쳐갔습니다.\n하지만 처음부터 하프타임 쇼가 이렇게 주목받았던 건 아닙니다. 초기에는 대학 마칭 밴드*가 소박하게 하프타임을 채웠습니다. 변화는 1990년대에 시작됐습니다. 경쟁 방송사들이 슈퍼볼 하프타임 시간대에 특별 프로그램을 편성하며 시청률 경쟁을 벌이자, NFL은 1991년 뉴키즈 온더 블록을 시작으로 슈퍼스타들을 무대에 올리기 시작했습니다.\n* 행진하며 악기를 연주하는 미국 대학의 관악대\nNFL은 1993년 마이클 잭슨의 공연이 폭발적인 반응을 얻으면서, 하프타임 쇼를 본격적으로 상업화했습니다. 흥미로운 점은 NFL이 출연 뮤지션에게 출연료를 지급하지 않는다는 사실입니다. 대신 밴드와 스태프는 물론, 가족과 친구를 포함한 모든 수행원의 경비만 부담합니다. 그럼에도 뮤지션들이 기꺼이 무료 공연에 나서는 이유는 분명합니다. 하프타임 쇼 출연 소식만으로도 음원 차트가 급상승하고, 1억 명 이상이 지켜보는 무대는 그 어떤 광고보다 강력한 홍보 효과를 만들어내기 때문입니다.\n\n2025 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼로 전 세계 음원 차트를 휩쓴 켄드릭 라마 / 사진:  Imago Images Sports\n초기 하프타임 쇼의 스폰서십 가격은 약 15억 원 수준이었습니다. 하지만 하프타임 쇼에 대한 관심이 높아지면서, 스폰서십 가격은 50배 가까이 올랐습니다. 타이어 제조회사 브리지스톤은 2008년부터 2012년까지 연간 약 150억 원, 펩시는 2013년부터 2022년까지 매년 361억 원을 스폰서십 비용으로 지출했습니다.\n2023년부터는 애플 뮤직이 스폰서로 나서며 연간 735억 원이라는 천문학적 금액을 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 음악 스트리밍 시장에서 스포티파이와 치열하게 경쟁 중인 애플 뮤직에게 이 투자는 결코 헛되지 않았습니다. 2025년 켄드릭 라마의 공연은 1억 3,350만 명이 시청하며 1993년 마이클 잭슨 이후 역대 최다 기록을 갈아치웠기 때문이죠.\n이제 FIFA 역시 슈퍼볼을 벤치마킹하기 시작했습니다. 오는 6월 열릴 북중미 월드컵 결승전에서 사상 첫 하프타임 쇼를 계획하고 있기 때문입니다. 다만 축구의 15분 하프타임 안에, 30분 이상이 소요되는 슈퍼볼 수준의 쇼를 구현할 수 있을지는 여전히 의문으로 남아 있습니다. FIFA가 자신들의 규칙을 지키면서 어떤 묘안을 내놓을지, 관심이 쏠립니다.\n미국인들의 버킷리스트\n슈퍼볼 직관\n슈퍼볼 입장권 가격 역시 상상을 초월합니다. 2025년 기준 평균 입장권 가격은 약 950만 원이었고, 가장 저렴한 좌석도 44만 원에 달했습니다. 이마저도 경기장 맨 꼭대기 층에 위치해, 실제로는 대형 스크린으로 경기를 봐야 할 정도입니다.\n이 금액은 미국 중산층에게도 부담스러운 수준입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아메리칸 풋볼에 열광하는 미국인들은 슈퍼볼 직관을 일생일대의 기회로 여깁니다. NFL의 인기가 높아질수록 이 꿈을 꾸는 사람은 늘어나고, 티켓 가격은 계속 오르지만 관중석은 늘 가득 찹니다.\n실제로 슈퍼볼 입장권 총 수익은 2010년 약 900억 원에서 2025년 약 2,400억 원으로 15년 사이 2.7배 증가했습니다. 7만~8만 명 규모의 경기장이 매년 거의 만석을 기록하면서 티켓 가격 상승이 곧바로 수익 증가로 이어지는 구조가 완성된 것이죠.\n\n하루 만에 맥주 24억 잔이 팔리는\n슈퍼볼 경제 효과\n2025년 루이지애나주 뉴올리언스에서 열린 제59회 슈퍼볼의 개최지 경제 효과는 약 1조 8,100억 원으로 추산됩니다. 이 가운데 절반은 외지에서 몰려든 팬들이 만들어낸 관광 특수였습니다. 10만 명이 넘는 팬들이 개최지를 찾았고, 이 중 92%가 평균 4일간 머물렀습니다. 그 결과 호텔 공실률은 4%에 불과했고, 슈퍼볼 준비 과정에서만 1만 개가 넘는 일자리가 새로 생겨났습니다. 세수 증대 효과 역시 1,000억 원을 훌쩍 넘었습니다.\n막대한 인프라 투자가 필요한 올림픽이나 월드컵과 달리, 슈퍼볼은 기존 시설만으로도 엄청난 수익을 만들어냅니다. 그래서 미국의 도시들은 슈퍼볼 유치를 두고 치열한 경쟁을 벌입니다. 과거에는 32개 NFL 구단의 투표로 개최지를 정했지만, 경쟁이 과열되자 2018년부터는 NFL이 도시들과 장기 협상을 통해 개최지를 결정하는 방식으로 바뀌었습니다.\n슈퍼볼 당일의 소비 규모도 놀랍습니다. 2025년 슈퍼볼 당일 미국에서는 맥주 12억 리터, 치킨 윙 14억 7,000개, 감자 칩 1,900만 개, 피자 290만 개가 팔렸습니다. 슈퍼볼은 미국에서 가장 많은 맥주가 소비되는 날이기도 합니다.\n\n슈퍼볼을 대표하는 음식이 된 치킨 윙 / 사진: Imagn Images\n슈퍼볼에는 미국의 역사가 깊이 새겨져 있습니다. 아메리칸 풋볼 자체가 영국의 럭비에서 독립해 만들어진 스포츠입니다. 19세기 말 미국 대학들이 영국의 영향에서 벗어나 자신들만의 규칙을 만들며 탄생시킨 아메리칸 풋볼은 문화적 독립의 상징이었죠.\n슈퍼볼 대표 음식 치킨 윙에는 더 아픈 역사가 담겨 있습니다. 백인 농장주들이 버린 닭 날개를 흑인 노예들이 모아 만들어 먹던 것이 1980년대 레스토랑과 바의 인기 메뉴가 되었고, 짜고 매운 소스가 맥주 판매를 늘리는 효과 덕분에 슈퍼볼의 상징이 되었습니다. 굶주림 속에서 태어난 음식이 미국 최대 축제의 주인공이 된 셈입니다.\n2026년 슈퍼볼이 열릴 경기장 역시 미국 역사의 한 장면을 보여줍니다. 캘리포니아주 산타 클라라의 리바이스 스타디움은 19세기 골드러시 시대 광부들을 위해 탄생한 청바지 브랜드 리바이스의 이름을 따왔습니다. 튼튼한 청바지로 황금을 찾아 나선 개척자들의 꿈을 지탱했던 리바이스는 이제 새로운 꿈을 좇는 미국인들이 모이는 성지가 되었죠.\n평등을 추구하는 리그 철학, 광고가 문화가 된 독특한 생태계, 그리고 모든 미국인의 꿈이 된 축제. 슈퍼볼은 이 모든 요소를 품고 성장했기에 미국인이 가장 사랑하는 지상 최대 스포츠 이벤트로 거듭날 수 있었습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희",

(예: 타지 대학생 자녀를 위해 빌린 오피스텔 등)\n내 집 마련 대출, 소득공제도 실수 없이!\n전세자금대출이나 주택담보대출을 갚고 있다면 이 항목을 주목하세요.\n⓵ 전세자금대출(주택임차자금): 2025년 12월 31일 기준 무주택 세대의 세대주여야 원리금 상환액을 공제받을 수 있습니다.\n⓶ 주택담보대출(장기주택저당차입금): 2025년 12월 31일 기준 무주택 또는 1주택 보유 세대의 세대주여야 이자 상환액을 공제받을 수 있어요. (세대주가 공제받지 않는 경우 세대원도 가능)\n⓷ 집값과 명의도 중요해요: 기준시가가 6억 원을 초과하는 주택이거나, 주택 소유자 명의가 아닌 대출은 공제 대상이 아닙니다. (6억 원 기준은 2024년 1월 1일 이후 취득분부터 적용돼요.)\n의료비 세액공제는 '실제로 낸 돈'만 계산해요\n나와 가족을 위해 쓴 의료비, 하지만 내가 직접 부담한 금액이 아니라면 제외해야 합니다.\n⓵ 보험금은 빼주세요: 의료비를 지출하고 실손 의료보험금을 수령했다면, 그 금액만큼은 공제 대상 의료비에서 제외해야 합니다.\n⓶ 사후환급금도 제외: 본인 부담 상한제 등으로 나중에 돌려받은 금액이 있다면 이 역시 공제 대상에서 제외해야 해요. 다만, 나중에 환급금이 발생해 수정신고를 하는 경우에는 가산세가 적용되지 않으니 안심하세요.\n국세청은 과다공제를 받은 것으로 추정되는 근로자를 대상으로 매년 하반기에 점검을 실시합니다. 실수로 공제를 더 많이 받았다가 나중에 가산세까지 더해 세금을 부담할 수 있으니 유의해야 합니다. 더 궁금한 점은 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}국세청 누리집이나 국세상담센터(126)를 통해 확인할 수 있습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}※ 해당 콘텐츠는 2026.01.23. 배포된 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}국세청 보도자료를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.",

While iconic American companies were born in college dorm rooms or in garages, Toss took root in the ordinary streets of Seoul, where people’s everyday lives take place.\nAround that time, four team members were scattered across Seoul, searching for the right business idea. They observed how people behaved, what inconveniences they faced, and where they spent most of their time. From these field observations came more than a hundred potential ideas like services for rating restaurant menus, a platform for amateur singers to upload performance videos, an app that takes photos of and stores receipts, and among them was making “money transfers and payments frictionless.”\nToss, in other words, didn’t set out from the start to be a “fintech startup.” The goal was simply to build something people genuinely needed, whatever that might be. This determination wasn’t built overnight. Before launching Toss, its founder Seunggun Lee had spent five years pursuing projects he wanted to do and building products he wanted to create. He failed eight times. Those repeated disappointments came to a costly and painful realization : it’s not about what I want to do, it’s about what people want.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\nThe reasons for his repeated failures finally became clear. At the same time, Seunggun Lee found himself in turmoil. He had started a company to pursue what he loved, only to realize that chasing what he wanted would never lead to success. (...) “It was a wake-up call. I told myself to stop messing around. Forget what you want , forget your ego. From now on, chase what will succeed. Let go of the pride. You’re just someone who makes what people want.”\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-1ebvaan{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}- .css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}Kyounghwa Jung, No Ordinary Challenge, Bookstone, 2022, p.29–30.css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\nIt was clear that people wanted ‘convenient’ finance. In the early 2010s, sending money online in Korea was likened to performing a small ritual. You had to install specific software, import your accredited certificate, dig out your security card to enter the code, and then type in a one-time password. Even the simplest everyday moments of splitting a dinner bill with a friend or paying for something online were unnecessarily cumbersome. The world was rapidly moving online, but money transfers and payments remained stuck in the past. Overseas, things were different. In the United States, PayPal and Cash App were already well established, and in the UK, TransferWise (now Wise) had gained traction. Toss began with a simple question : Why should sending and receiving money be so difficult?\nA few years earlier, Seunggun Lee had been making donations to the Purme Foundation, a relationship that began while he was working at a dental hospital for people with disabilities. One day, a question crossed his mind: “What authority does the Purme Foundation have to withdraw money directly from my bank account?” That single thought became the starting point. (...) The answer was in recurring payments. He discovered that recurring payments weren’t just used for nonprofit donations, but also for things like paying for milk deliveries or newspaper subscriptions. When a business used such recurring payments, it could automatically withdraw funds from a customer’s account on a set date and deposit them into the designated account. (…) Finally, it seemed as though he had found a solution.\n- Kyounghwa Jung, No Ordinary Challenge, Bookstone, 2022, p.35–36\nOn February 23, 2015, Toss officially introduced its simple money transfer service to the world. Open the app, enter the amount, type in an account number or contact, and finish with a password made of just four digits and one letter. That was it. The transfer was complete. To reassure users who thought it was almost too easy, Toss displayed a message on the screen: .css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;}“The transfer is complete. Really.”\nPeople responded quickly. Three out of ten users came back the following week, and seven out of ten returned a month later.* The daily transaction volume and number of active users grew 1.4 times every week. That meant four to five times more activity in just a month, a pace rarely seen in financial apps. After a long, arduous journey, Toss finally found itself at the real starting line. Along the way, it embedded two lessons into its DNA: create services people truly need, and never be afraid of failure.\n* In the weeks right after launch, Toss’ weekly retention exceeded 30%, and its monthly retention reached as high as 70%.\nI realized that victory comes with humility, and with the courage to admit your weaknesses. To me, success begins when you no longer fear the sting of failure. Two teams can pursue the same idea, but it’s the mindset that determines which team succeeds.\n- Seunggun Lee, Toss Team Leader, ”The Beginning of Toss: PO SESSION”, Toss YouTube channel\nToss started to raise more questions. “Why should people have to pay to check their credit?” “Why does getting a loan take so long?” “Why is investment so complicated?” These were the kind of questions that were so plain and ordinary that most people overlooked. But Toss didn’t let them pass. It started searching for answers, and those answers turned into services that changed the market. From industry-first offerings like free credit checks and a loan comparison service to Toss Securities, which made investing accessible directly from your phone, and Toss Bank, which made banking as easy and casual as daily life, each question became a spark for everyday change.\nBy the summer of 2025, Toss had surpassed 30 million cumulative users. What began as a simple money transfer app had grown to offer more than 100 services, present at nearly every moment when money moves. The number of services has expanded, but the North Star remains unchanged: to question the obvious, find better answers, and redefine the standards of the world. The questions drawn from people’s everyday lives remain at the heart of Toss, fueling its extraordinary challenge even today.\nFollow us on .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}LinkedIn and explore more detailed updates about Toss.",
