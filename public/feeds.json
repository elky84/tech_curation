We are excited to see you all at CppCon this year, where we’ll once again be delivering a variety of presentations, from the latest advancements in debugging technology to extensibility frameworks for AI agents. See the end of this post for a listing of all of the sessions involving Microsoft staff. And yes, there’ll be plenty of information on the freshly announced Visual Studio 2026.\nWe’ll also have a booth through the first four days of the conference. Come on by and let us know what matters to you or ask any burning questions you may have regarding C++ at Microsoft. We will be well stocked with our most popular swag, so come on by and have a chat with us. There may even be appearances by speakers in case you didn’t get a chance to ask that all important question after their session.\nOur annual survey is now open and will be available all week throughout the conference. It’s super lightweight, and upon completion, CppCon attendees will be entered into a raffle for one of four great prizes. You do have to be onsite for the daily drawing to win (see official rules here), but even if you aren’t going to be at the conference, you can still complete the survey to let us know what you think of our C++ products. New this year on the survey is an option to select a dedicated time to talk with Microsoft staff about the topics you care about. So, if you don’t want to lose your voice in a crowded expo hall you can find that right time that fits into your busy schedule.\nTry out Visual Studio 2026 Insiders – Get Started Here\nVisual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools v14.50 Preview are already available on the Insiders Channel (which replaces the previous Visual Studio 2022 Preview channel), with a Stable Channel going live later in 2025. We want to hear from you at CppCon about your experiences with Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, so give it a spin and come chat with us about your experiences.\nTalks from Microsoft employees (and friends)\nMonday 15th​\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach, by Chandranath Bhattacharyya & Bharat Kumar\nTuesday​ 16th​\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents, by Alexandra Kemper\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025, by David Li and Augustin Popa\nBack to Basics: Code Review, by Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\n​Wednesday 17th\nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), by Ben McMorran\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI, by Ion Todirel\nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]!, by Inbal Levi\n C++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects, by Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\n Thursday 18th​​\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugging: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code, by Eric Brumer\nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial, by Michael Price\nFriday 19th​​\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second, by Daniel Lemire and Francisco Geiman Thiesen\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop, by Victor Ciura\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025 appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "GitHub releases are fantastic for distributing your open-source projects, as they let you turn any code revision into ready-to-go assets with a detailed version history. What makes them particularly popular, though, is that they give users a proper Download button (because not everyone dreams of compiling source code).\nIn TeamCity, the traditional approach for publishing GitHub releases is to run custom scripts via the Command Line build step. While certainly viable, this approach comes with a catch: You need to write and maintain that script and handle authentication on your own. Even more frustrating, TeamCity already has a perfectly good authentication token tucked away in your VCS root – an authentication token that you cannot directly reuse.\nThe new GitHub Releases Support plugin aims to eliminate this inconvenience once and for all. No more guesswork, no more custom scripting. With just a few clicks, you can publish your builds as GitHub releases and focus on shipping features instead of wrangling scripts.\nInstall\nThis is an unbundled plugin, which means you’ll need to download it from our Marketplace and install it on your server. To do this, click the Get button in the top right corner of the plugin page, or go directly to the Admin | Plugins page of your TeamCity server and click Browse plugins repository.\nSee also: Installing Additional Plugins\nConfigure\nOnce the plugin is installed, you can add the GitHub Release step to build configurations as you would any other build step.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the key settings:\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Repository – The GitHub repository where your release will be published. TeamCity automatically lists repositories based on the VCS roots attached to the parent build configuration.\nRelease Tag – The unique tag to label your new release. Use a parameter reference (%teamcity_parameter_name%) to fetch this value from a TeamCity parameter. You can provide this value before the build starts (via the Run Custom Build dialog) or calculate it during a build.\nRelease Title and Release Notes –  Additional details that are optional, but highly recommended. Your users will appreciate a concise description and some context. You can import the content for these fields from TeamCity parameters and let GitHub append its own auto-generated notes to your custom ones.\nAsset Paths – Files you want to publish as release assets. If you’ve run the build before, you can simply browse and select files using the folder browser instead of typing paths manually.\nRelease Options – A field where you can mark the release as a draft or pre-release, or flag it as the latest release.\n\n\n\n\nThe plugin supports multiple authentication methods, seen in the Commit Status Publisher or similar TeamCity build features.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse VCS root credentials — Reuse the same authentication method your VCS root already uses.\nAccess Token — Provide a personal GitHub access token, issued on your GitHub profile settings page.\nGitHub App access token — Use an existing GitHub App token, or create a new one, directly from TeamCity. See this documentation article for more information.\nKotlin DSL\nFor those who enjoy configuration as code, here’s how the step settings look in the Kotlin DSL:\ngitHubRelease {\n    name = \"Publish release\"\n    targetVcsRootId = \"${myVcsRoot.id}\"\n    githubUrl = \"https://api.github.com\"\n    tagName = \"v%release.version.number%\" // Supports parameter references\n    releaseName = \"Release %release.version.number%\" // Optional, uses 'tagName' if omitted\n    releaseNotes = \"\"\"\n            ## Changelog:\n            %release.changelist%\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    // Optional, specified files will be uploaded as release assets.\n    // Paths are relative to the checkout directory, files should be present when this step runs\n    assetPaths=\"\"\"\n            library/build/libs/library-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n            app/build/libs/app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    latest = true // Optional, labels the published release as the latest one\n    authType = vcsRoot()\n}\nRun\nOnce everything is set up, hit that big blue Run button.\nWhen the build finishes, you’ll see a Release Details section on the Build Results page. From there, click the provided link to open your freshly minted GitHub release. (Cue a sigh of relief, and maybe a small celebration.)\n\n\n\n\nYour Feedback Matters!\nThe GitHub Releases Support plugin may not come bundled in TeamCity, but we hope you find it as handy as many of the bundled ones.\nHave any ideas or requests? Would you like to give our developers a virtual high-five? Drop by JetBrains Marketplace to leave a review, or get in touch through our regular feedback channels. We listen closely to user requests and always value your feedback.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The ICPC World Finals 2025 in Baku was an unforgettable event, and we were honored to be part of it once again. It’s always a joy to see the brightest students from across the globe. The Finals reminds us why supporting the ICPC is such a vital mission – it’s about community, talent, and the future of technology.\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Finals brought together the brightest students and ICPC teams from around the world, and we were glad to see that participants from the JetBrains-supported program at Neapolis University Pafos (NUP) also qualified to compete among the best. Their team, Sigma++, proudly represented their university in Baku and was awarded an Honors distinction at the World Finals.\nIn his welcome speech, Andrey Ivanov, Senior VP of People, Research, and Investments at JetBrains, highlighted what makes the ICPC so special for us:\n\n“What I enjoy most about the ICPC and all its events is the feeling of a growing family and community. Every year we meet wonderful people – last year in Astana, this year here in Baku – and I know our paths will cross again and again.”\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to everyone who made the event possible:\n\n“I want to thank all the organizers for making this event possible. The spirit of the ICPC is alive thanks to your efforts, and it’s a real joy to see such an incredible setting for the Finals here in Baku.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis words reflected our long-standing commitment to the ICPC and the values we share with its community.\n\n\n\n\nHighlights from JetBrains at the Finals\nThe booth and chillzone areas\nThroughout the Finals week, we met with participants in two locations. At our booth, they enjoyed tackling the Kotlin Challenge, tested their predictions for the Finals outcomes, sent postcards to family and friends, and posed with Kodee. We also talked about JetBrains tools, including our new AI agent Junie, which we presented for the first time to such a large global ICPC audience.\nIn the bustling JetBrains chillzone area, participants tried the new Nav&Code Challenge (where one teammate sees the screen and the other types), snapped instant team photos, and took part in a fun quiz about JetBrains and the ICPC. They also tested their skills in our super-fun Junie challenge, where teams prompted Junie to build an app from a mockup, with twist cards adding surprises. \nThis setup worked especially well because, for the first time in years, all participants were staying in the same hotel – a unique opportunity that made it possible to create a shared space with our photo wall and activities. Right after the quiz and the Junie challenge, a participant came up to us and said:\n\n“I just wanted to thank you for being here. It’s JetBrains that creates this amazing atmosphere.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth locations became lively hubs where contestants, coaches, and volunteers connected and shared their excitement for the competition. Another familiar detail was JetBrains notebooks on every team’s desk, a tradition we’ve maintained for years at both the ICPC Finals and regional contests. These special notebooks help participants structure their thoughts on paper during the contest – much like our tools support them in writing great code.\nJetBrains Tech Trek and Kotlin Heroes\nThe highlight of our presence at the Finals was the JetBrains Tech Trek. JetBrains Developer Advocate Sebastian Aigner opened the session by introducing Junie, our smart coding agent. He then talked about JetBrains IDEs that help in competitions and real-world development, providing students and teachers with access to modern development tools and AI in classrooms worldwide. Sebastian also explored how Kotlin – one of the official ICPC languages – is used in education and industry, and can now help with building modern AI libraries using koog.ai, a new Kotlin framework for building AI agents.\nThis seamlessly led into the live stage contest, where two of the world’s top competitive programmers, Andrew ‘ecnerwala’ He and David ‘SecondThread’ Harmeyer, went head to head in a live coding race on stage. They were solving problems from the Kotlin Heroes: Episode 13 practice round, now open to all. The main contest will take place on September 12, which means you still have time to register and compete for a chance to win a T-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nIn addition to demonstrating the power of algorithms and teamwork, the Finals in Baku reinforced the sense of community that connects ICPC participants worldwide. We were inspired to see students work hard, collaborate, discover solutions under time pressure, and just have fun together.\nWe were especially proud to see the majority of participants who had joined our Pafos Programming Camp 2025 in August. Eight of the teams made it into the top 50 worldwide:\nUniversity of Novi Sad – 11th place, bronze medal 🥉\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology – 13th place (Highest Honors)\nUniversity of Maryland – 14th place (Highest Honors), with 7 out of 9 elegant solutions written in Kotlin\nHasso Plattner Institute – 29th place (High Honors)\nUniversità di Pisa – 39th place (High Honors)\nDelft University of Technology – 40th place (Honors)\nJagiellonian University in Krakow – 42nd place (Honors)\nUniversity of Wroclaw – 43rd place (Honors)\n\n\n\n\nThe full scoreboard can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s fantastic to see how well the teams prepared for the Finals, and we’re glad that Pafos Camp was part of their journey.\nWe congratulate all the medalists and finalists who made it to Baku. To every participant, coach, and organizer – thank you for your energy, passion, and determination!\nHere’s to another year of the ICPC, to many more collaborations, and to the friendships and ideas that will keep growing beyond the Finals. Stay tuned for what’s next – and we’ll see you at future contests, camps, and challenges!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nAI coding agents are no longer research experiments. They are quickly becoming practical tools that can help developers solve real problems. \nBut how do you know whether an agent is good enough for serious use? How do you measure progress when its answers are not always predictable and when there may be various correct solutions to the same task?\nThis is where systematic testing comes in. At JetBrains, we needed a way to test our own coding agent, Junie, on real-world development tasks. To achieve this, we built an evaluation pipeline powered by TeamCity and SWE-bench, a popular benchmark that provides real bugs and fixes from open-source projects.\n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I will walk you through how it works, the challenges we faced, and the solutions we found.\nPrerequisites\nIn our GitHub project, you can find a repository that contains the TeamCity Kotlin DSL and describes every component you need. You can plug it into your own TeamCity and run the full pipeline, just as I’ll demonstrate in this blog post.\n👉 Check out and fork the project 👈\nWhy this matters\nTesting AI coding agents is not like testing ordinary software. With regular programs, you can rely on unit and integration tests. With agents, things are different. Their output can vary from run to run, and there are often multiple valid ways to solve the same problem. This makes traditional testing methods ineffective.\nTo use coding agents effectively, you must answer a few critical questions: Are the results correct? Are they consistent over time? What does each run cost in compute and API usage? \nAt JetBrains, Junie’s team tracks metrics such as solved-task percentage, cost per run, common failure types, and performance across versions. This data provides clear evidence of progress and ensures that development decisions are based on facts rather than impressions.\n💡Read also: How Junie Uses TeamCity to Evaluate Coding Agents\nSWE-bench: Your benchmark toolkit\nBenchmarks give us a consistent way to test agents. SWE-bench is one of the most widely used because it is based on real issues from real projects. For every task, we know:\nThe exact project and commit where the problem appeared.\nThe correct fix.\nTests that prove both the bug and the solution.\nThe evaluation method is straightforward: Provide the agent with the project and task, let it propose a fix, run the tests, and see if they pass. SWE-bench also provides Python tooling to prepare Docker images with the correct dependencies and environments, as well as scripts to evaluate solutions.\nIn our project, we used SWE-bench Lite, a smaller variant of the full benchmark. The pipeline is flexible, so you can adapt it to any benchmark you prefer.\nBuilding stable, reusable pipelines\nOne of the biggest challenges is ensuring that every run happens in a stable, identical environment. Without this, it is impossible to know whether a failure was due to the agent or some minor setup difference.\nWhy stability matters\nTo reproduce each task, we must download the code, install dependencies, and prepare the environment. Any external hiccup, like a slow package server or rate limits on Hugging Face (which hosts the datasets), can cause tasks to fail incorrectly.\nThe Hugging Face bottleneck\nIf every TeamCity agent downloads datasets directly from Hugging Face, the requests quickly hit limits. This results in HTTP 429 errors and failed runs – not because the agent was wrong, but because the dataset could not be retrieved.\nThe solution: Caching with artifacts\nTo fix this, we created a dedicated TeamCity job that downloads the dataset and tooling once, packages them into ZIP archives, and publishes them as artifacts. All other build configurations use these cached artifacts instead of contacting Hugging Face.\nThe dataset download build type uses a Python script to cache the SWE-bench Lite dataset:\n# Download the dataset with caching\ndataset = load_dataset(\n    \"princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite\",\n    cache_dir=cache_dir,\n    split=\"test\"\n)\nSource: scripts/download_dataset.py\nThe build configuration packages the cache as artifacts:\nartifactRules = \"\"\"\n    dataset_cache/** => dataset_cache.zip\n    .venv => venv.zip\n\"\"\".trimIndent()\nSource: SWE_bench_Lite.kt\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits include:\nNo more rate limits.\nFaster builds with less wasted time.\nMore reliable runs.\nConsistent datasets across all tests.\nDocker image caching\nWe extended this same caching approach to Docker images. Each task gets its own image with the project source code, Python version, dependencies, and test environment. These images are cached and reused. When new tasks are added, only their images are rebuilt.\npython {\n    name = \"Build Docker image for $taskId\"\n    command = module {\n        module = \"swebench.harness.prepare_images\"\n        scriptArguments = \"--instance_ids $taskId --tag $instanceImageOrigTag\"\n    }\n}\n\ndockerCommand {\n    name = \"Save Docker Image for $taskId\"\n    commandType = other {\n        subCommand = \"save\"\n        commandArgs = \"-o $taskId.tar $instanceImageOrig\"\n    }\n}\nSource: SWE_Bench_lite_TaskEnv.kt \nThis ensures stability and lowers costs, and it has the added advantage of making results reproducible.\n\n\n\n\nCost-efficient and scalable execution\nThough possible, running hundreds of tasks at once is wasteful. Instead, we built configurations that run smaller subsets: 10 tasks, 30 tasks, or 50 tasks.\n\n\n\n\nThe project creates different-sized task sets for cost-efficient testing:\nval tenTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\nval thirtyTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\nval fiftyTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\n\ntasks.forEachIndexed { index, task ->\n    val taskConfiguration = createTaskForGeminiBuildType(task)\n    if (index % 10 == 0 && tenTasksSet.size < 10) tenTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n    if (index % 7 == 0 && thirtyTasksSet.size < 30) thirtyTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n    if (index % 5 == 0 && fiftyTasksSet.size < 50) fiftyTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n}\n\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(tenTasksSet, agentGemini))\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(thirtyTasksSet, agentGemini))\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(fiftyTasksSet, agentGemini))\nSource: Google_Gemini_CLI_AI_Agent.kt \nThis setup gives us flexibility: Daily runs can use the smaller sets for quick checks, while strong-performing agents can be scaled up to larger runs. If an agent fails early, we can stop immediately and save resources.\nThe 10-task run in particular works like a build verification test. It is fast and inexpensive, yet still provides statistical insight into the agent’s health.\nInfrastructure stability and resource control\nBy caching datasets and Docker images, our pipelines no longer depend on unstable network downloads. Failures now reflect the agent’s quality, not infrastructure problems.\nTeamCity’s resource management features also help us control concurrency. Since providers may limit request rates, we can set a maximum number of parallel agent runs. This prevents overload, avoids provider errors, and keeps the evaluation system available for everyone on the team.\nThis defines a shared resource with a quota of 20 concurrent connections, which limits how many builds can simultaneously access Hugging Face services, preventing rate limit issues:\nsharedResource {\n    id = \"HuggingFaceConnections\"\n    name = \"HuggingFaceConnection\"\n    resourceType = quoted(20)\n}\nSource: settings.kt\nfeatures {\n    sharedResources {\n        readLock(\"HuggingFaceConnection\")\n    }\n}\nSource: SWE_Bench_Lite_TaskEnv.kt\nA summary of the benefits\nWith this setup, we gain:\nEconomy: We can reuse datasets and environments efficiently.\nStability: The setup leads to fewer random failures.\nReproducibility: Runs are carried out in identical environments.\nTrustworthy metrics: Results reflect agent performance rather than noise.\nFlexibility: The Kotlin DSL makes it easy to generate hundreds of configurations.\nVisibility: We gain clear insight into agent quality over time.\nPower: TeamCity proves itself useful beyond CI/CD by serving as a robust testing platform.\nOur pipeline automatically tags runs with visual indicators for quick assessment:\nresolved_instances = data.get('resolved_instances', 0)\nunresolved_instances = data.get('unresolved_instances', 0)\nerror_instances = data.get('error_instances', 0)\n\nif resolved_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '✅ Good solution']\")\nif unresolved_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '❌ Bad solution']\")\nif error_instances > 0 or empty_patch_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '  Error']\")\nSource: scripts/tag_task_execution.py\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe built a reliable and efficient system for testing AI coding agents with TeamCity and SWE-bench Lite. Repeatable, cost-effective, and adaptable, the pipeline provides reliable metrics.\nTeamCity is not just for continuous integration and deployment – it is also an excellent platform for evaluating AI agents.\nYou can find all repositories and resources linked in our project.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting with version 2025.2.1, CLion now supports Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, thanks to an integration that is currently in Beta.\nDevelopers working on embedded systems, projects written in C or C++, or performance-critical software can now experience the full benefit of Junie’s project insights and tooling, directly in CLion. With Junie, you get the structure and visibility you’ve been missing. No more grepping through build logs or reverse-engineering target configs – Junie does it all.\nLet’s take a look at what makes this integration so powerful and why it’s great news for C and C++ developers.\nTRY JUNIE IN CLION\nThe power of Junie in CLion\nJunie, the AI coding agent created by JetBrains, gives developers deep visibility into projects and helps supercharge their development workflows, right inside the IDE. It was built to address their specific needs, independently completing tasks like testing code, fixing bugs, bootstrapping and prototyping, searching inside projects, writing behavioral specifications and documentation, describing execution paths, and more! By bringing Junie into CLion, we’re providing a unified experience. Now, you get all the benefits of Junie without ever leaving your IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with Junie in CLion\nGet answers\nYou can put Junie in Ask mode, and it will then answer any questions you give it about modules, directories, execution paths, project setup and configuration, and other complex topics. To fully understand the context of your project, Junie uses many of the tools available in the IDE, such as Search Everywhere, the file structure, code analysis, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAsking about a method’s functionality\nAsk mode is designed for question-and-answer tasks. If you want Junie to change code or create files, use Code mode.\nGenerate README\nJunie can help you understand your codebase and project structure, and it can even generate README files for this purpose. Below is an example of generating a README file for one of the demo projects shipped with the Bullet Physics SDK:\n\n                        \n\n\nGenerating a README for a C++ project\nUse Code mode to generate tests\nIn Code mode, you can have Junie create tests that use frameworks such as GoogleTest, Catch2, or CppUnit.\n\n                        \n\n\nCreating a Google test\nJunie will even run the tests for you, and when a test is done, you will receive a report detailing all the files Junie modified or created:\n\n\n\n\nJunie’s report about the test results\nIf you’re not satisfied with the test implementation, you can undo the changes by clicking the Rollback button in the Junie tool window.\nReview your code and fix bugs\nYou can ask Junie to review your code changes to ensure they are correct before you commit them. Junie will examine different aspects of your changes, including behavior and compatibility, code quality, and style. Junie will also share recommendations for improvements.\n\n                        \n\n\nReviewing code changes\nIn Code mode, Junie can fix any bugs it finds and immediately test the solution. After updating files, Junie provides links that allow you to view the code changes in the Diff Viewer. You can then accept or reject the results.\nGive Junie more autonomy\nIn Code mode, Junie requires your approval to make potentially sensitive changes, execute terminal commands, and perform other actions. However, if you trust Junie and don’t want to spend effort on micromanaging its decisions, you can enable Brave mode in the task window. This mode will allow Junie to execute all actions without your approval.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Brave mode\nBrave mode can save you time and is helpful, for example, when you need to execute certain routine tasks regularly.\nImplement guidelines\nYou can document testing scripts, third-party tool usage, and development guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md at the project root. Junie will then follow these guidelines while working on every task. You can either add the file manually or ask Junie to generate it for you.\nCurrent limitations\nJunie doesn’t yet work well with remote or WSL toolchains. The Beta release of this Junie integration mainly focuses on CMake projects, so you may need to manually reload the project model for other project types. We’ll notify you as soon as these issues are addressed.\nStart using Junie in CLion today \nGetting Junie set up in CLion is simple. There are three main options to make it happen: \nInstallation from the JetBrains AI widget﻿\nInstallation from the in-IDE Marketplace﻿ tab\nInstallation from disk\nFor more details to help you choose the installation option that best fits your needs, take a look at our general guidelines, and if you have any additional questions, check out the documentation.\nWe value your feedback! If you have anything to share or if you run into any problems, please let us know through our issue tracker.",

You can now provide icons using factory methods, and the platform has been updated with a range of enhancements.\nDOWNLOAD MPS 2025.2\nImportant notice: Update the MPS merge driver\nWe’ve changed the logic in the MPS merge driver, which detects the persistence approach used for individual files, and we’ve also dropped a few old persistence hacks. It is important to allow MPS to update the merge driver when it detects that an older version is specified in your projects.\n\nWhat’s new\nCheck out all the updates available in the latest release.\nBinary launchers for Windows and Linux\nMPS now includes native binary launchers for Windows and Linux. These launchers provide a more robust and convenient way to start MPS than the script-based launchers, for example, by allowing you to pin the application to the taskbar and to the start menu.\ncreate updated build scripts, so you don’t need to take any additional action when working on a new project.\nAdding binary launchers and product-info.json to existing build scripts\nIf you’re updating an older MPS-based distribution to include the new binary launchers, please follow the steps mentioned in the documentation.\n\nFactory method icons\nIn addition to the existing TextIcon, FileIcon, and ConstantFieldIcon concepts, a new FactoryMethodIcon concept is now available. It allows an icon to be specified by reference to a concrete static factory method declaration that creates and returns an instance of javax.swing.Icon.\n\nResolve-info updated during copy-paste\nResolve-info is now correctly updated when copying references to the clipboard. When you rename the target of a reference, such as a variable, without using the Rename refactoring, the resolve-info of references pointing to that target will not be updated. However, as soon as you copy such references to the clipboard, their resolve-info gets updated correctly, and the references will be correctly re-resolved when pasted.\nRaising the bar to Java 21\nMPS is keeping pace with the evolving Java ecosystem. In this release, we’ve updated both the source and target compatibility to Java 21, unlocking access to new language features and improved runtime performance.\nMore new features…\nCheck out the What’s New page to learn all about the new features.\nhere.\nGive all the new features a try, and let us know what you think.\nYour JetBrains MPS team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "You have probably seen this picture occasionally and wondered what is happening with your IDE and why it freezes! This is a tricky question, and many types of bugs and performance issues may lead to UI freezes.\nJetBrains IDEs are built on top of a UI framework (the Java AWT) that uses a single thread, the event dispatch thread (EDT), to perform painting operations and process user input events.\nA UI freeze occurs when the IDE cannot execute operations on the EDT, preventing interaction with the IDE. This blog tries to consolidate our knowledge about freezing reasons and causes. Use it to investigate and resolve UI freezes in your IDE plugins!\nThe IntelliJ Platform’s UI architecture\nBecause our UI frameworks are built on top of a single thread, it is important to keep the EDT from remaining blocked for a long time. The EDT runs an event loop that processes AWT events. Typical examples of these events are user input (such as typing or moving the mouse) and repaint requests from Swing.\nEvents need to be processed within 16 ms. Otherwise, the IDE is not able to render 60 frames per second.\nInvestigating UI freezes\nIn the vast majority of cases, simply looking at the thread dump will give you the information you need about a UI freeze. The investigation should start with the thread AWT-EventQueue-N – this is the EDT. Normally, its name should be AWT-EventQueue-0. If you see a bigger number in the suffix, there might be a platform issue.\nIn the event of a UI freeze, the EDT is usually blocked on some kind of lock.\nFreezes caused by the read-write lock\nIf you are unfamiliar with the concept of the IntelliJ Platform’s read-write lock, you can learn more about it from this notebook.\nDue to the IntelliJ Platform’s architecture, the write lock is often acquired on the EDT. Since it often isn’t possible to acquire the write lock immediately, you will sometimes see the following lines in the stack trace of the EDT:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer@3a946cba\nat java.base@21.0.8/java.lang.Object.wait0(Native Method)\n...\n(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.upgradeWritePermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:370)\n...\nat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:921)\n...\nat com.intellij.ide.IdeEventQueue.dispatchEvent(IdeEventQueue.kt:347)\n...\nat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThe key line here is marked with (!). This line indicates that the EDT is blocked on the acquisition of the write lock. In this case, there is no need to look above. The IntelliJ Platform usually enters emergency mode if it detects a UI freeze and runs some of its internal procedures.\nThe EDT being blocked on the write lock is a sign that a thread is running under the read lock. The next step in our investigation is to find this background thread. This can be done by searching for a substring readAction (case-insensitive) in the thread dump.\nFor example, we may find the following thread:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 1/11\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 runnable\n     java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.QuantifierNounCompatibility.<clinit>(QuantifierNounCompatibility.java:38)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.AgreementSet.<clinit>(AgreementSet.java:42)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.PluralsInCompounds.<clinit>(PluralsInCompounds.java:21)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.Articles.<clinit>(Articles.java:250)\n\t...\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.toolkit.LanguageToolkit.allParameters(LanguageToolkit.java:87)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.grazie.pro.TreeRuleChecker.calcParameters(TreeRuleChecker.java:234)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.codeInsight.daemon.impl.AnnotatorRunner$$Lambda/0x00000070047e8000.run(Unknown Source)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.tryRunReadAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:826)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nThis thread is taken from ForkJoinPool, and we see that it is currently running a read action (at (!)). We also see AnnotatorRunner in the stack trace, which means that this thread is currently running highlighting. The read actions in highlighting are canceled on a pending write action, which means that the UI freeze is caused by the code not checking for ProgressManager.checkCanceled. In the middle of the block, we see some traces from the Grazie plugin (starting from (!!)). This concludes our investigation. We’ve found the problem – Grazie does not check for checkCanceled frequently enough, which causes the UI to freeze.\nFreezes caused by a background write action\nThe IntelliJ Platform gradually moves write actions to background threads, but this functionality is currently unstable, and it can cause additional UI freezes and deadlocks.\nWhile a write action can run in the background, the EDT still often acquires a write-intent lock, resulting in stack traces like the following:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #91 [119043] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=71985.87ms elapsed=1065.05s tid=0x00000001610c4c00 nid=119043 sleeping [0x0000000398429000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.sleep0(java.base@21.0.8/Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.acquireWriteIntentPermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:416)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThis means that the EDT cannot immediately acquire a write-intent lock. Our next step is to search for a write action. In this case, it may appear in coroutine dumps. For example:\n- \"RefreshQueue pool\":StandaloneCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5, Rete(abortOnError=false, commands=capacity=2147483647,data=[onReceive], reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516, dbSource=ReteDbSource(reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516)), DbSourceContextElement(kernel Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5), ComponentManager(ApplicationImpl@106897812), com.intellij.codeWithMe.ClientIdContextElementPrecursor, Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)]\n\tat com.intellij.core.rwmutex.WriteIntentPermitImpl.acquireWriteActionPermit(RWMutexIdea.kt:263)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl.processEventsSuspending(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:191)\n  ...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl$queueAsyncSessionWithCoroutines$3$1.invokeSuspend(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:177)\nHere we see that a coroutine is SUSPENDED on acquisition of the write lock. In particular, VFS refresh cannot proceed, which means that a read action is alive. Indeed:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 7/9\" #201 [175107] daemon prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=153605.15ms elapsed=1039.57s tid=0x0000000142955a00 nid=175107 runnable  [0x00000003610e7000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\tat com.intellij.psi.impl.file.impl.MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.get(MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.kt:67)\n\t...\n\tat org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeInsight.lineMarkers.KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.collectSlowLineMarkers(KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.kt:35)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(java.base@21.0.8/ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nHere we again arrive at the conclusion that some code cannot be canceled due to the read action. The process of resolving this freeze is similar to what we have discussed above.\nSuvorovProgress\nSometimes the EDT is blocked in a class named SuvorovProgress:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer@215bb938\n\tat java.base@21.0.7/java.lang.Object.wait0(Native Method)\n\tat java.base@21.0.7/java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:366)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer.dispatchAllEventsForTimeout(SuvorovProgress.kt:261)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.SuvorovProgress.processInvocationEventsWithoutDialog(SuvorovProgress.kt:125)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.SuvorovProgress.dispatchEventsUntilComputationCompletes(SuvorovProgress.kt:73)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.lambda$postInit$14(ApplicationImpl.java:1434)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl$$Lambda/0x000076ace059cff8.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.RunSuspend.await(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:1517)\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupportKt.runSuspendWithWaitingConsumer(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:1472)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:921)\n\t...\n\tat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:105)\n\tat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nSuvorovProgress is merely a symptom of a UI freeze, however. It indicates that the IntelliJ Platform is in emergency mode, where it is still able to run certain trusted AWT events or draw a freeze popup UI.\nIt is very rarely a cause of a freeze, so the problem is likely somewhere else.\nFreezes caused by thread starvation\nThe IntelliJ Platform uses the Kotlin Coroutines library a lot. In coroutines, there are two major thread pools: Dispatchers.Default and Dispatchers.IO. Both are bounded, with Dispatchers.Default containing as many threads as there are cores in your machine and Dispatchers.IO containing 64 threads. If all these threads are blocked on some operation, then the IDE encounters thread starvation – a situation where coroutine machinery cannot progress because all threads in a thread pool are blocked.\nThe usual symptom of thread starvation is coroutines being stuck in the Cancelling state. They cannot move into Cancelled because they cannot execute cleanup actions on their respective thread pools.\nTo investigate thread starvation of the Default dispatcher, you need to find all blocked threads that contain runDefaultDispatcherTask.\nFor example:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-9@28483\" daemon prio=5 tid=0xa0 nid=NA waiting\n  java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Unsafe.java:-1)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:269)\n\t...\n\t\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Builders.kt:48)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Unknown Source:1)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.platform.pluginManager.frontend.BackendUiPluginManagerController.awaitForResult(BackendUiPluginManagerController.kt:293)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler.runSafely(CoroutineScheduler.kt:610)\n\t(!) at kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runDefaultDispatcherTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:882)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.executeTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:906)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runWorker(CoroutineScheduler.kt:775)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:762)\nIf there are as many such threads as cores in your machine (at (!)), then you have signs of thread starvation. Similarly, if you’re dealing with thread starvation of the IO dispatcher, you’ll have 64 blocked threads named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N.\nNB: It is not enough to look at all threads that are named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N to conclude that there is thread starvation of the Default dispatcher. The coroutine scheduler shares physical threads between the Default and IO dispatchers, so it is difficult to say which thread belongs to which dispatcher without actually looking at the source code.\nTo fix thread starvation, blocking operations need to be moved out of the Default dispatcher. Here we see that runBlocking is used in the line with (!!), and it needs to be moved to a different dispatcher.\nFreezes caused by service initialization\nAnother frequent source of locks in the IntelliJ Platform is service initialization. Since services are initialized once, a thread that tries to access a service can block while waiting for initialization on another thread.\nHere’s an example of this scenario:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #59 [128003] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=3011.23ms elapsed=172.40s tid=0x000000012c07ae00 nid=128003 waiting on condition  [0x000000039b0ae000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImplKt.runBlockingInitialization$lambda$9(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:1660)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImpl.getService(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:672)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebuggerManager.getInstance(XDebuggerManager.java:32)\n\t...\n\t(!!!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:939)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nWe see that the EDT is blocked on the initialization of a service in the line marked (!). The service is XDebuggerManager (at (!!)), so there might be something wrong inside it. Additionally, we note that this process is running under the write action (at (!!!)), an observation that will be useful later.\nBy searching for XDebuggerManager, we can find the following thread:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-4\" #55 [130051] daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=1537.10ms elapsed=172.41s tid=0x000000012b883c00 nid=130051 in Object.wait()  [0x000000036b607000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (on object monitor)\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait0(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.runReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1028)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.breakpoints.XBreakpointManagerImpl.loadState(XBreakpointManagerImpl.java:536)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:388)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:81)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.configurationStore.ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.initComponentBlocking(ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.kt:43)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:765)\nThe service instance initialization at (!!) tries to acquire the read lock (at (!)). The problem is clear – the write action on the EDT is blocked on the lock in service init, and service init is blocked on the read lock acquisition. This is a deadlock because of the incorrect order of the two locks.\nThe best way to fix it is to move the read action out of service initialization. If this is not possible, you can preload the service in the read action. This way, service initialization will inherit read access.\nHow to deal with runBlocking\nSometimes, you may notice that a thread is blocked in runBlocking. This means that it is trying to execute coroutines synchronously.\nFor example:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 6/15\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on kotlinx.coroutines.BlockingCoroutine@41813fd4\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$BuildersKt__BuildersKt(Builders.kt:85)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.progress.CoroutinesKt.runBlockingCancellable(coroutines.kt:117)\n\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner.run(CheckerRunner.kt:53)\n\t...\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nFirst, we need to make sure that runBlockingCancellable is present (at (!)). This is a special platform version of runBlocking that works well with our cancellation machinery.\nSince this thread runs the read action (at (!!)), we now need to figure out why it cannot be canceled. To do this, we need to look in the coroutine dump and search for the coroutine tree starting with BlockingCoroutine (this is the name of the coroutine corresponding to runBlocking). Here’s what we find:\n- JobImpl{Active}\n\t- BlockingCoroutine{Active}@41813fd4, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:69)\n\t\t- DeferredCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.SentenceBatcher$forSentences$1.parseAsync(SentenceBatcher.kt:96)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.CloudOrLocalBatchParser.parseAsync(CloudOrLocalBatchParser.kt:20)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.ParsedSentence$Companion.getSentences(ParsedSentence.kt:104)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker.checkExternally$suspendImpl(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:18)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker$Style.checkExternally(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:48)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1$deferred$1$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:56)\nWe see that this coroutine runs at com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner, which means that this BlockingCoroutine corresponds to runBlocking in the above trace. Now we can inspect the coroutine tree and try to find out the cause of the freeze.\nSince the state of the coroutine is DeferredCoroutine{Active}, it is not canceled. This means something is wrong with cancellation in the platform, as the platform should cancel all read actions on an incoming write action; hence, all coroutines should also be canceled. Normally, we should see BlockingCoroutine{Cancelling} here. \nTo fix this UI freeze, we need to figure out why the coroutine cannot transition to the {Cancelled} state. Most likely, the code does not call ProgressManager.checkCanceled() frequently enough.\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we explored common sources of UI freezes in IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform. Most often, the freezes are caused by insufficient cooperation between plugin code and the IntelliJ Platform. By using the IntelliJ Platform’s primitives for executing cancellable operations, we can greatly improve the responsiveness of JetBrains IDEs.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Note: This is a guest post from John Arundel, a Go writer and teacher who blogs at bitfieldconsulting.com. His most recent book is The Deeper Love of Go.\nHow do you break it to someone that they’ve wasted most of their life? Well, I worked with a guy who didn’t know how to copy and paste. Every time he wanted to move some code, he’d delete it and then grimly re-type the whole thing somewhere else, as I watched in silent dismay: “How do I tell him?”\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t want to be able to copy and paste. He just had no idea that he could – he’d never taken the time to fiddle around and find out.\nThat guy is all of us, in a way. Even if we can copy and paste, what other editor superpowers are we missing out on? And how much time are we wasting by not knowing about them? I’m just going to confidently say “Some”, right?\nA modern IDE is more than just a text editor – it’s also a file manager, debugger, linter, AI assistant, and so on. Even better, an IDE like GoLand actually understands Go, so it can make suggestions as you type, highlight errors, annotate your code, and refactor automatically.\nHere are ten things you might not know GoLand can do, and each one will make you more productive as a Go developer.\nSearch everywhere\n90% of software engineering is just finding stuff, I reckon: where is that function defined? Where did I put that struct type?\nDouble-tap the Shift key in GoLand and type to search everywhere”: definitions, symbols, filenames, or even editor features. For example, enter search to see all search-related settings.\n\n\n\n\nGo to implementation\nCmd-click a function or variable name and GoLand will take you straight to its definition, even in another package or file (or even the standard library or your dependencies). And you can keep drilling down further until you find what you need, then use Cmd-[ to jump back.\n\n\n\n\nStructure view\nFor a high-level overview of your constants, functions, types, and their associated methods, press Cmd-F12 to open the Structure view of your file or package. Click on any item to go to its definition.\n\n\n\n\nParameter names\nGoLand shows inline hints for function calls, giving parameter names for each function argument. This makes reading code easier, especially when arguments are nil, for example. You’ll also see name hints for results in a return statement, and field names for struct literals that omit them.\n\n\n\n\nErrors and warnings\nSure, GoLand can point out compile errors – an angry red underline indicates the offending code, and you can hover the mouse over it to see what’s wrong (or use the Inspection Lens plugin to see all errors inline without hovering). Saved you a compile-edit-fix cycle.\nThat’s great, but GoLand will also warn you about probable mistakes: unreachable code, unhandled errors, unused functions, redundant type conversions, or variable names that shadow the name of a package. Even though they’re technically legal (the best kind of legal), they’re likely not what you meant, and GoLand will pick these up and offer to auto-fix them.\n\n\n\n\nNil pointer analysis\nAh, pointers! The cause of – and solution to – all programming problems. Specifically, pointers can be nil (meaning “doesn’t point to any value”). That’s a problem if you try to dereference such a pointer (that is, ask Go to give you the value it points to), and by “problem” I mean “horrible crash”.\nBut how can you tell whether a pointer will be nil at run time without running the program? Only by understanding the complete history of that variable throughout the code. Unfortunately, even GoLand isn’t yet smart enough to *touches earpiece* and I’m being told that in fact GoLand is now smart enough to do that.\nThe experimental data flow analysis feature simulates the execution of your program to catch run-time errors like nil pointers even before you run it. That’s something I’ve never seen before in an IDE, and it’s pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nCompletions and templates\nYou’d expect GoLand to offer inline completions of function and variable names and so on, but that’s table stakes. Even more powerful are live templates: parameterized code snippets you can insert and complete interactively.\nFor example, if you want to write a for ... range loop, type for, and select For range loop from the picklist (or type forr and press Tab). You’ll get a skeleton for loop with placeholders for you to fill in the loop variables and body.\nSimilarly, if you get bored typing if err != nil... repeatedly (but how could anyone find that boring?) GoLand can fill in the error-handling block for you, if you ask nicely.\nLive templates automate dozens of the most common Go patterns and idioms, and you can create your own, with placeholders like $INDEX$ for parameters you want users to fill in.\nAlso, if you have a blob of JSON data that you need to turn into a Go type, just paste it into the editor. GoLand will offer to generate the struct definition for you automatically, complete with json tags to make it parseable.\n\n\n\n\nRefactoring\nDo you ever wish you’d named your child something different? It might be a bit late to revisit that one, but fortunately it’s always possible to rename things in your Go programs, like functions and variables.\nManually retyping them everywhere would be annoying, and normal search-and-replace is error-prone (the Scunthorpe problem). GoLand is smarter about this because it understands Go: it knows if a word is a variable or function name, and avoids replacing it if it’s in some other context like inside a string or a comment.\nAlso, you can edit a function’s signature, adding or removing parameters as you like, and GoLand will automatically change the calls to that function everywhere.\nOr try this one weird tip to slim down your chubby functions, and make your code beach body ready: select some lines and use Extract method to replace them with a call to a method that does the same thing. By eliminating paperwork, you make the program more readable and focus on what’s actually relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nNow, I’m not saying you ever write bugs – perish the thought. Shall we say rather that programs occasionally don’t behave exactly the way we expect them to? Figuring out just where and why things are going wrong can be difficult, unless you can shrink down to the size of an electron and go inside the computer to see what’s happening (I’m still waiting on that Kickstarter).\nFailing this, though, GoLand’s debugger is a pretty acceptable substitute. For example, set a breakpoint on a suspicious line and the debugger will stop the program there, keeping all variables intact so that you can inspect them (or edit them). Breakpoints can be conditional, too, so you only stop if a certain expression is true.\nThen, if the problem still isn’t clear, you can Step Over to continue executing the code line by line, or Step Into to follow function calls down the rabbit hole.\nTo get really inside baseball, you can set a watch on the variables you’re interested in, or even arbitrary Go expressions, and see their values change as the program runs.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains AI tools\nYou were expecting this, right? Everything has AI now (or as I like to say, “Everything’s computer”). GoLand’s optional AI Assistant plugin is there, not to supplant your wonderfully human intelligence, but to support it.\nFor example, you can highlight some code and ask the assistant to explain it,  suggest refactorings, or generate tests. You can ask it questions about the language or the standard library – all those “at this point I’m afraid to ask” things, and it won’t judge you.\nNaturally, you can also use Junie, the JetBrains AI coding agent, as part of GoLand. You can ask Junie to write whole packages or programs for you, or to read a bunch of user requirements and sketch out a system design, then implement it.\nIf there’s some project you’ve always wanted to write, but you aren’t sure how to get started, collaborating with Junie could get you unblocked. Think of Junie as a pair programmer who doesn’t get bored or lose focus, and who can help you out with program structure and algorithms while still letting you have the fun of writing the interesting parts yourself.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more\nWhat’s that? Ten superpowers aren’t enough for you? You’ve got some attitude, mister. Look, GoLand can do more than we’ve had time to cover here – a lot more. But these ten things are a great place to start. Once you’ve mastered them, feel free to explore: read the docs, click around, try stuff out.\nDon’t be like my non-copy-pasting friend, always too busy cutting wood to stop and sharpen the saw. A few minutes a day invested in really learning your IDE is time well spent. Pretty soon, these superpowers will become part of your muscle memory, just like copy and paste. (GoLand has that too. You’re welcome.)",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Watch behind the scenes of the Profiler Agent\nHead on over to the Copilot Profiler Agent to watch.\n\n\nWe’re excited to announce the Copilot Profiler Agent available in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, it’s an AI-powered performance assistant built directly into Visual Studio. Forget staring at endless call trees or walls of mysterious numbers that leave you asking, “where do I even start?” The Copilot Profiler Agent changes that.  \nInstead of raw data, you now get an AI partner that not only points out the real bottlenecks but also explains what’s going on, suggests fixes, writes benchmarks, and even validates improvements all in a smooth, guided loop. \nIt’s like having a performance engineer sitting next to you. Without the coffee runs. And starting today, it’s ready for action in the latest version of Visual Studio, powered by GitHub Copilot. Download Visual Studio 2026 Insiders today.\n\nCopilot Profiler Agent \nMeet the Copilot Profiler Agent \nThe Profiler Agent is the first-of-its-kind AI assistant in Visual Studio, designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot. \nHere’s what it can do for you:\nAnalyze CPU usage, memory allocations, and runtime behavior\nSurface the most expensive bottlenecks in your code\nGenerate new BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks (or optimize existing ones)\nSuggest actionable performance improvements you can apply instantly\nValidate fixes with before/after metrics, all in a smooth guided loop\nAnd the best part, it’s as easy as asking a question in Copilot Chat. You can:\nTag it directly: @profiler Why is my app slow?\nOr just ask in plain language in Copilot agent mode: “Why is my frame rate dropping?”\n(Just make sure the Profiler Agent is enabled in the Copilot Chat tool menu.)\nNow, let’s take a look at it in action. In the demo below, you will see I pointed the agent at an existing benchmark in SharpZipLib and asked it to optimize. From there, it handled everything: running the benchmark, guiding me through the changes, applying targeted performance fixes, and validating the results by re-running the benchmark. The result was a measurable performance improvement, all from a single prompt.\n\nReal Code. Real Impact\nWhen we set out to build the Copilot Profiler Agent, we knew one thing for sure: showing it off on a “hello world” app wasn’t going to prove anything. Real developers don’t struggle with toy code. The real test was whether it could handle messy, performance-critical, production-grade projects. \nSo we aimed high: pointing the Profiler Agent at the top 100 most widely used open-source libraries and applications the kind of code that powers frameworks, services, and apps you probably use every single day. \nThe results blew past our expectations. The Profiler Agent : \n Surfaced hidden bottlenecks you wouldn’t spot on your own \nSuggested practical, actionable fixes \n Auto-generated benchmarks to validate improvements \n Turned insights into real pull requests on real projects \nWe’ve already contributed PRs to CSVHelper, NLog, Serilog, and more all powered by the Profiler Agent’s insights. \nAnd the feedback from the community says it all: \nSaw the YouTube video and it is almost magical. Amazing how it was able to recognize that multiple expression-compiles could be merged into a single expression-compile.– NLog Maintainer \nWe’ll be publishing a detailed case studies soon, walking through exactly how the Profiler Agent tackled these projects step by step. \nThis isn’t just OSS, either. We rolled out the Profiler Agent for internal dogfooding across Microsoft teams, and the results have been equally eye-opening. \nHere’s one story from a Principal Engineer: \nI had a class that wrapped a dictionary and exposed a limited set of operations. I wanted to support foreach on the class, so I added IEnumerable<TKey, TValue>, but this caused a big jump in memory use and execution time compared to iterating directly over the inner dictionary. After several prompt iterations with the profiler agent, it nudged me toward the realization that .NET supports duck typing for foreach. I didn’t need IEnumerable at all just exposing GetEnumerator that forwards to the inner dictionary worked.  \nHonestly, I’m not sure I would have figured this out on my own. I even asked several principal-level engineers with deep .NET experience, and none of them knew about this either. When focused on allocation optimization, the profiler agent does a great job of spotting improvements. \nWhat’s Next \nThis is just the beginning. The Profiler Agent currently supports high CPU usage analysis and .NET object allocations and memory usage analysis and more coming soon. \nWe’re excited to see how you use this in your own workflows whether it’s tuning a game engine, optimizing a service, or just speeding up a slow UI. So please try it out and don’t forget to Share your results by taking this short survey.  \nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nDemocratizing profiling, one performance wins at a time.   \n \n \n \nThe post Democratizing Performance: The Copilot Profiler Agent in Action on Real Code appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Watch the Visual Studio 2026 Insiders release party\nHead on over to the Visual Studio YouTube channel to watch.\n\nVisual Studio 2026 Insiders is here – and it marks one of the most ambitious steps forward we’ve taken with the IDE.\nThis release brings AI woven directly into the developer workflow, performance improvements that reset expectations for speed at enterprise scale, and a modern design that makes the environment feel lighter and more focused.\nAnd for the first time, we’re introducing the new Insiders Channel, which replaces the long-standing Preview Channel as the way developers can get early access to upcoming features.\nThis is a release you can feel the moment you start using it – download the Insiders release and check out the release notes and see for yourself. And don’t miss out on Copilot Free to unleash the full power of AI in Visual Studio 2026.\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.It’s all part of a simple but powerful goal: keeping developers in flow so you can spend less time fighting the tooling and more time solving the hard problems that matter. The IDE is made by developers, for developers – and you will always be at the center of the experience. Here’s a teaser of some of the things you can find in this new version:\nAI Integrated Development\nAI in Visual Studio 2026 isn’t bolted on. It’s woven into the daily rhythms of coding. Think of it as a quiet partner that knows your solution, respects your muscle memory, and offers help that’s timely rather than intrusive.\nYou’ll notice it when you drop into a new codebase and the IDE helps you understand what you’re looking at, suggests the kinds of tests that usually get written in your repo, and keeps your docs and comments in step with your code. You’ll feel it when a “paste and fix” moment becomes a single confirmation because the editor adapts the snippet to your project’s patterns and conventions. And when performance questions pop up, you won’t be guessing – guidance is grounded in real traces and validated with benchmarks, so fixes come with confidence, not hope.\nCode reviews start with clear, actionable insights about correctness, performance, and security – on your machine, before you ever open a pull request. Through it all, you stay in control. The IDE takes the busy-work; you keep the judgment. The result is simple: you move faster, and your code gets better.\n\nThe Profiler Agent can identify and fix performance issues in your code.\nBlazing fast performance\nSpeed shapes what you can build in a day. In 2026, the loops you run most – opening solutions, navigating code, building, and pressing F5 – tighten up. You’ll notice that first launch feels snappier, big solutions feel lighter, and the time between an idea and a running app keeps shrinking. The gains show up on large codebases and they hold across both x64 and Arm64, so your machine’s power turns directly into developer velocity.\nYou’ll feel it when you can jump between branches without losing your stride, when a full build doesn’t break your flow, and when pressing F5 is something you do instinctively because the wait is measured in moments.\nEarly feedback says it plainly:\n“HOLY […] this is FAST.” – early previewer\n“It’s blazing fast on all my projects.” – Visual Studio MVP\nA modern look and feel\nClarity matters when you live in an IDE. Visual Studio 2026 introduces a cleaner and more modern visual language. The result is a workspace that feels calm and intentional.\nYou’ll notice crisper lines, improved iconography, and better spacing of visual elements. Options feel approachable rather than overwhelming, so tuning the IDE to your preferences is quick instead of delicate.\nManaging extensions is straightforward, and a plethora of new color themes help your environment feel personal – comfortable for long sessions, focused when the pressure is on, and accessible by default.\nIt’s a design that respects your attention and helps you stay oriented, even in the largest solutions.\n\nVisual Studio 2026 redesigned using Fluent UI and ships with 11 new tinted themes\nTry it today\nReady to see the future of Visual Studio? You can get started right now:\nDownload Visual Studio 2026 Insider\nGet GitHub Copilot Free\nRead the release notes\nDeveloper Community Feedback\nVisual Studio 2026 installs side-by-side with earlier versions, and if you’re on Visual Studio 2022 you can import components and settings to get coding right away.\nThis is just the beginning. We’ll ship monthly updates that bring the latest performance improvements, design refinements, and AI innovations. And over the coming weeks, we’ll share deeper dives right here on the blog, so make sure to come back soon.\nThank you\nVisual Studio has always been about more than code – it’s about the community of developers who build, grow, and push us to make the IDE better every day. Thank you for being part of this journey and for making Visual Studio the IDE trusted by millions worldwide.\nHappy coding,\nThe Visual Studio Team\nKnown issue\nThere’s a known issue that can cause errors to show up for some users. Learn more about the issue and follow the ticket for more information.\nThe post Visual Studio 2026 Insiders is here! appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

그래서 저는 그림판으로 앱의 UI를 대략적으로 스케치해서 업로드하는 방식을 택했습니다. 인터페이스 디자인을 직접 그리는 것만으로도 LLM이 이를 기반으로 앱을 만들어 줄 수 있다는 점이 정말 놀라웠어요!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 화면을 크게 세 부분으로 나누었어요. 왼쪽에는 <b>CASE 목록</b>을, 중앙에는 이미지를 편집하는 <b>작업 목록</b>을, 그리고 오른쪽에는 <b>결과물</b>을 출력하도록 말이죠. 이렇게 작업 프로세스의 순서대로 한 화면에 구성하면 사용자가 훨씬 직관적으로 앱을 사용할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/uI13Q/btsQzzcqivZ/pitKKJA0GPMRkhhnNKN7qK/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/uI13Q/btsQzzcqivZ/pitKKJA0GPMRkhhnNKN7qK/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/uI13Q/btsQzzcqivZ/pitKKJA0GPMRkhhnNKN7qK/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FuI13Q%2FbtsQzzcqivZ%2FpitKKJA0GPMRkhhnNKN7qK%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"AI 앱 개발의 초기 UI/UX 디자인 스케치. 3단계 패널 구성의 웹 인터페이스 와이어프레임.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 12px; border-left: 5px solid #1a73e8; padding-left: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>3단계: 성공적인 앱 개발을 위한 사전 고려사항</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">본격적인 앱 개발에 앞서 몇 가지 중요한 고려사항을 정리했습니다. 이 과정을 거치면 처음 시도하는 작업에서도 비교적 원하는 결과물을 얻을 확률이 높아져요.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><b><span style=\"color: #1a73e8;\">한글 앱 지원</span></b>: 사용자 편의성을 위해 당연히 한글로 앱이 구동되어야 했습니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><b><span style=\"color: #1a73e8;\">카테고리 분류</span></b>: 168개나 되는 CASE를 무작정 나열하면 사용성이 떨어질 테니, 카테고리별 분류가 필수였죠.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><b><span style=\"color: #1a73e8;\">컨텍스트 용량 고려</span></b>: AI 코딩 시 컨텍스트 용량은 아주 중요한데요. 168개 CASE의 제목과 프롬프트가 모두 하나의 파일에 들어가면 에러가 발생하거나 수정이 어려울 수 있습니다. 이를 분할하는 전략이 필요했어요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><b><span style=\"color: #1a73e8;\">원문 프롬프트 유지</span></b>: 한글 앱이지만, AI 이미지 생성의 최적 결과물을 위해서는 프롬프트는 원문 그대로 영어로 유지해야 한다는 점을 인지했습니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 12px; border-left: 5px solid #1a73e8; padding-left: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>4단계: AI Studio 앱빌더와 함께하는 구현 과정</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이제 그림판 스케치와 정리된 데이터를 가지고 AI Studio 앱빌더로 향했습니다. 미리 그려둔 UI 이미지를 업로드하고, 프롬프트 데이터가 담긴 `README.md` 파일을 `txt` 확장자로 변경하여 함께 올렸어요. 그리고 대화창에 <b>\"2개 문서에 있는 CASE 별 프롬프트를 이용한 나노바나나를 활용한 이미지 생성 편집 한글 앱\"</b>이라고 입력하며, 앞서 메모장에 정리한 요청사항들을 상세히 덧붙여 앱 생성을 요청했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">처음 앱이 생성되었을 때는 아쉬움이 좀 있었어요. 왼쪽 CASE 목록에 168개보다 훨씬 적은 수의 케이스만 보였거든요. 하지만 걱정 마세요!

'나노바나나'가 무엇인가요?\n나노바나나는 구글 Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 모델의 커뮤니티 별명이에요. 이 혁신적인 AI 모델은 캐릭터 일관성 유지, 다중 이미지 합성, 정확한 텍스트 표현 같은 놀라운 기능들을 자랑합니다. 오래된 사진 복원, 이미지 속 물체 제거, 여러 이미지를 자연스럽게 합성하는 등 정말 다양한 작업이 가능해서 많은 크리에이터들이 주목하고 있죠.\n분명 AI 이미지 생성이나 편집할 때 어떤 프롬프트를 써야 할지 막막했던 경험, 한 번쯤 있으실 거예요. 복잡한 프롬프트 작성에 시간을 허비하거나, 원하는 결과물을 얻기 위해 수없이 시도하며 좌절했던 순간들... 이제 걱정 마세요! 이 앱 하나면 여러분의 그런 고민을 시원하게 해결해 드릴 수 있을 거라고 확신합니다.\n  나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 왜 지금 필요할까요?\n현재 많은 분들이 나노바나나 프롬프트를 활용하기 위해 전문가들이 공유한 웹사이트를 직접 방문하고, 마음에 드는 프롬프트를 일일이 복사해서 Gemini나 AI STUDIO 같은 툴에 붙여넣어 실행하는 번거로운 과정을 거치고 계실 거예요. 이런 수작업은 시간이 많이 들 뿐만 아니라, 168개나 되는 프롬프트를 모두 효율적으로 관리하기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니죠.\n그래서 저는 이런 불편함을 완전히 해소하고 싶었습니다. 168개의 프롬프트를 단 하나의 웹앱에서 한눈에 보고, 클릭 몇 번으로 원하는 기법을 선택해서 바로 테스트해볼 수 있는 혁신적인 도구, 바로 '나노바나나 쇼케이스 앱'을 개발하게 된 배경입니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분의 AI 이미지 작업이 훨씬 더 빠르고, 편리하고, 즐거워질 거라 기대해요.\n ️ 나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 , 개발 과정 엿보기\n이 앱이 탄생하기까지 어떤 과정들을 거쳤는지 궁금하지 않으신가요? 제 생각엔, 이러한 개발 과정이 여러분이 직접 AI 앱을 만들 때도 좋은 참고가 될 수 있을 것 같아요. 몇 단계를 거쳐 이 편리한 앱이 완성되었는지 함께 살펴보시죠!\n1단계: 핵심 재료, 프롬프트 데이터 준비\n모든 요리에 좋은 재료가 필요하듯, 앱 개발의 첫걸음은 바로 '핵심 재료'인 프롬프트 모음을 준비하는 것이었어요. 전 세계 전문가들이 나노바나나를 활용해 만든 결과물과 프롬프트가 공유된 깃허브(GitHub) 저장소에서 이 귀중한 데이터들을 수집했습니다. 각 케이스별로 어떤 결과물이 나오는지, 그리고 어떤 프롬프트가 사용되었는지 꼼꼼하게 확인하는 과정이 필요했죠.\n특히, 데이터를 효과적으로 사용하려면 그 구조를 미리 파악하는 게 중요합니다. 케이스 제목, 만든이 정보, 상세 설명, 그리고 핵심 프롬프트가 어떻게 구성되어 있는지 분석하는 데 시간을 들였어요. 이렇게 정리된 데이터가 앱의 뼈대가 되었습니다.\n2단계: UI/UX 디자인, 스케치부터 시작!\n요즘 LLM(거대 언어 모델)들은 멀티모달 기능을 기본적으로 지원하는 경우가 많잖아요? 그래서 저는 그림판으로 앱의 UI를 대략적으로 스케치해서 업로드하는 방식을 택했습니다. 인터페이스 디자인을 직접 그리는 것만으로도 LLM이 이를 기반으로 앱을 만들어 줄 수 있다는 점이 정말 놀라웠어요!\n저는 화면을 크게 세 부분으로 나누었어요. 왼쪽에는 CASE 목록을, 중앙에는 이미지를 편집하는 작업 목록을, 그리고 오른쪽에는 결과물을 출력하도록 말이죠. 이렇게 작업 프로세스의 순서대로 한 화면에 구성하면 사용자가 훨씬 직관적으로 앱을 사용할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n3단계: 성공적인 앱 개발을 위한 사전 고려사항\n본격적인 앱 개발에 앞서 몇 가지 중요한 고려사항을 정리했습니다. 이 과정을 거치면 처음 시도하는 작업에서도 비교적 원하는 결과물을 얻을 확률이 높아져요.\n한글 앱 지원: 사용자 편의성을 위해 당연히 한글로 앱이 구동되어야 했습니다.\n카테고리 분류: 168개나 되는 CASE를 무작정 나열하면 사용성이 떨어질 테니, 카테고리별 분류가 필수였죠.\n컨텍스트 용량 고려: AI 코딩 시 컨텍스트 용량은 아주 중요한데요. 168개 CASE의 제목과 프롬프트가 모두 하나의 파일에 들어가면 에러가 발생하거나 수정이 어려울 수 있습니다. 이를 분할하는 전략이 필요했어요.\n원문 프롬프트 유지: 한글 앱이지만, AI 이미지 생성의 최적 결과물을 위해서는 프롬프트는 원문 그대로 영어로 유지해야 한다는 점을 인지했습니다.\n4단계: AI Studio 앱빌더와 함께하는 구현 과정\n이제 그림판 스케치와 정리된 데이터를 가지고 AI Studio 앱빌더로 향했습니다. 미리 그려둔 UI 이미지를 업로드하고, 프롬프트 데이터가 담긴 `README.md` 파일을 `txt` 확장자로 변경하여 함께 올렸어요. 그리고 대화창에 \"2개 문서에 있는 CASE 별 프롬프트를 이용한 나노바나나를 활용한 이미지 생성 편집 한글 앱\"이라고 입력하며, 앞서 메모장에 정리한 요청사항들을 상세히 덧붙여 앱 생성을 요청했습니다.\n처음 앱이 생성되었을 때는 아쉬움이 좀 있었어요. 왼쪽 CASE 목록에 168개보다 훨씬 적은 수의 케이스만 보였거든요. 하지만 걱정 마세요! AI와의 대화는 계속됩니다. 저는 곧바로 \"2개 파일에 총 168개의 CASE가 있어. 누락되는 CASE 없이 모두 적용해. CASE가 너무 많아 소스 DATA도 카테고리별로 생성해\"라고 다시 요청했습니다. 잠시 후, 모든 CASE가 완벽하게 적용된 것을 확인했고, '일러스트를 피규어로' 같은 기능을 테스트해보니 동작도 제대로 하는 것을 알 수 있었습니다. 아, 정말 뿌듯하더라고요!\n✨ 사용자 경험을 극대화하는 앱 기능 업그레이드\n앱이 기본적인 형태를 갖추었으니, 이제 사용자 경험을 한층 더 끌어올릴 시간이었어요. 몇 가지 핵심 기능을 추가하고 개선하는 과정을 거쳤습니다.\n\n\n1단계: 결과물 확대 및 다운로드 기능 추가\n처음에는 생성된 이미지가 너무 작아서 불편하다는 생각이 들었어요. 그래서 \"결과물을 클릭하면 확대하고 다운로드 버튼을 추가해\"라고 요청했습니다. 놀랍게도 클릭 시 이미지가 확대되고, 한 번의 클릭으로 이미지를 저장할 수 있는 다운로드 버튼까지 완벽하게 추가되었습니다. 사소하지만 정말 편리한 기능이죠!\n2단계: 카테고리 시각화 및 넘버링으로 가독성 향상\n168개의 프롬프트는 결코 적은 수가 아니잖아요? CASE 목록의 카테고리 명이 눈에 잘 띄지 않아 불편할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요. \"카테고리명을 눈에 더 잘 띄게 버튼 형태로 변경해\"라는 요청과 함께, \"CASE에 넘버를 추가해\"라고 요청했습니다. 덕분에 이제 원하는 프롬프트를 훨씬 빠르고 쉽게 찾을 수 있게 되었습니다.\n3단계: AI 프롬프트 제안 기능으로 창작의 날개를 달다!\n이 앱의 가장 강력한 기능 중 하나가 바로 'AI 프롬프트 제안' 기능이라고 생각해요. 기존 프롬프트만 사용하는 것을 넘어, 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 추가 요청사항에 맞춰 AI가 개선된 프롬프트를 제안해주도록 요청했습니다.\n예를 들어, CASE 6번 '캐릭터 디자인'으로 테스트해봤어요. 기본 프롬프트는 입력한 이미지를 다양한 포즈의 디자인 시트로 만들어주는 것인데, 여기에 '교복 대신 체육복'이라는 추가 입력을 하고 AI에게 프롬프트를 제안받아 실행해보니, 와! 이미지에 체육복이 제대로 적용되는 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다. 이건 정말 창작의 가능성을 무한히 넓혀주는 기능이라고 할 수 있죠!\n4단계: 최종 마무리! 패널 조절 및 웹페이지 링크\n마지막으로, 사용자의 편의를 위해 메인 3개 패널의 폭을 자유롭게 조절할 수 있도록 했어요. 그리고 각 CASE별 실제 사용법을 자세히 볼 수 있도록 해당 웹페이지의 링크까지 추가하여 앱을 완벽하게 마무리했습니다. 이 작은 디테일들이 모여 사용자에게 큰 만족감을 줄 거라고 믿어요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n✔ 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱 무료 공개: AI 이미지 작업을 위한 필수 도구!\n✔ Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 모델 완벽 활용: 혁신적인 AI 이미지 생성 및 편집 가능.\n✔ 직관적인 웹앱 인터페이스: 168개 프롬프트를 한눈에, 클릭 한 번으로 실행.\n✔ AI 프롬프트 제안 기능: 사용자의 요청과 이미지를 기반으로 최적화된 프롬프트 자동 생성.\n이 앱은 AI 이미지 작업의 효율성을 극대화하고 창작의 재미를 더해줄 것입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 어떻게 사용할 수 있나요?\nA1: 앱은 웹 기반으로 제공되며, 별도의 설치 없이 인터넷 브라우저를 통해 접속할 수 있습니다. 각 섹션에 설명된 개발 과정을 통해 앱의 주요 기능과 사용법을 익히실 수 있습니다. 링크는 블로그 포스트 하단에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\nQ2: AI 프롬프트 제안 기능은 어떤 식으로 작동하나요?\nA2: 이 기능은 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 텍스트로 추가하는 요청사항을 분석하여, 기존 프롬프트를 더욱 개선하거나 사용자 의도에 맞는 새로운 프롬프트를 생성해줍니다. 이를 통해 더 정교하고 독창적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\nQ3: 앱이 무료로 제공되는데, 기능 제한은 없나요?\nA3: 네, 현재 공개된 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 모든 기능을 제한 없이 무료로 제공됩니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분이 부담 없이 AI 이미지 생성의 즐거움을 만끽하시길 바랍니다.\n{\"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\": [{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 어떻게 사용할 수 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"@type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"앱은 웹 기반으로 제공되며, 별도의 설치 없이 인터넷 브라우저를 통해 접속할 수 있습니다. 각 섹션에 설명된 개발 과정을 통해 앱의 주요 기능과 사용법을 익히실 수 있습니다. 링크는 블로그 포스트 하단에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\"}},{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"AI 프롬프트 제안 기능은 어떤 식으로 작동하나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"@type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"이 기능은 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 텍스트로 추가하는 요청사항을 분석하여, 기존 프롬프트를 더욱 개선하거나 사용자 의도에 맞는 새로운 프롬프트를 생성해줍니다. 이를 통해 더 정교하고 독창적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\"}},{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"앱이 무료로 제공되는데, 기능 제한은 없나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"네, 현재 공개된 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 모든 기능을 제한 없이 무료로 제공됩니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분이 부담 없이 AI 이미지 생성의 즐거움을 만끽하시길 바랍니다.\"}}]} \n마무리하며: 새로운 창작의 문을 열다!\n이렇게 해서 많은 분들의 기대를 모았던 '나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 모음 앱'이 드디어 완성되었습니다! 이 앱은 단순히 프롬프트를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, AI Studio 앱빌더를 활용하여 개발 과정에서 겪었던 시행착오와 해결 과정까지 담은, 저에게는 참 의미 있는 결과물이에요.\nAI 이미지 생성과 편집이 이렇게 쉽고 강력해질 수 있다는 사실에 저 스스로도 다시 한번 놀라곤 합니다. 여러분의 소중한 시간과 노력을 아껴주고, 동시에 창작의 영감을 불어넣어 줄 이 앱을 지금 바로 무료로 경험해보세요!\n앱 링크는 아래에서 확인하실 수 있습니다. 많은 관심과 활용 부탁드리며, 여러분의 멋진 AI 작품들을 기대하겠습니다!\n나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 바로가기\nhttps://ai.studio/apps/drive/1aRW7y-kpscwD7QKyVQfP8Mf6vyuNjtSm\n\n \n로그인 - Google 계정\n이메일 또는 휴대전화\naccounts.google.com",

        "contentSnippet": "사진 편집, 아직도 어렵고 복잡하게 느끼시나요? 포토샵의 높은 문턱에 좌절했던 분들이라면 주목해주세요! 2025년, 구글 Gemini의 강력한 AI 모델 '나노바나나'가 사진 편집의 판도를 바꾸고 있습니다. 초보자도 전문가처럼, 단 몇 번의 대화만으로 놀라운 결과물을 얻을 수 있는 이 혁신적인 도구에 대해 자세히 알아보겠습니다.\n  포토샵은 옛말? AI 기반 이미지 편집의 도래\n\n\n예전에는 멋진 사진을 만들려면 포토샵 같은 전문 프로그램을 다루는 기술이 필수적이었죠. 하지만 수십 가지의 도구와 슬라이더, 복잡한 레이어 개념까지… 숙련된 편집자가 아니라면 원하는 결과를 얻기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니었습니다. 저 역시 처음 포토샵을 배울 때 수많은 튜토리얼을 찾아보며 진땀을 뺐던 기억이 생생합니다. 바로 이런 지점에서 AI 기술이 사진 편집의 새로운 지평을 열고 있습니다.\n최근 저는 제 셀피를 픽셀(Pixel)의 AI 편집 기능으로 수정해봤는데, 결과가 정말 훌륭했어요. 그러나 이제는 Gemini를 통해 편집하면 포토샵이 필요 없을 정도로 놀라운 경험을 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 특히 Gemini의 최신 모델인 ‘나노바나나(Nano Banana)’는 이미지 편집에 특화되어, 마치 마법처럼 사진을 변신시켜줍니다.\n✂️ 포토샵, 그 익숙함 뒤의 불편함\n포토샵은 분명 놀라운 소프트웨어입니다. 전문적인 결과물을 만들어낼 수 있는 다양한 도구들을 제공하며, 일부는 AI 기술로 구동되기도 하죠. 막히는 부분이 있다면 인터넷에 넘쳐나는 튜토리얼이 큰 도움이 됩니다. 하지만 포토샵을 제대로 활용하려면 몇 가지 넘어야 할 산이 있습니다.\n높은 진입 장벽: 기술과 비용\n기술적 난이도: 포토샵은 일정 수준의 기술 숙련도를 요구합니다. 수많은 기능들을 익히는 데 상당한 시간과 노력이 필요하죠.\n고사양 컴퓨터: 프로그램을 원활하게 실행하려면 강력한 사양의 컴퓨터가 필요합니다.\n구독료 부담: 어도비(Adobe)의 구독료는 적지 않은 재정적 투자를 요구합니다. 첫 사진을 열어보기도 전에 비용 지불이 선행되어야 합니다.\n복잡한 사용법과 시간 투자\n물론 포토샵이 제공하는 정밀한 제어 기능은 훌륭합니다. 하지만 사실 전문 사진작가나 그래픽 디자이너가 아니라면 그 모든 기능이 다 필요하지 않을 때가 많습니다. 대부분의 일반적인 사진 편집에는 포토샵이 제공하는 복잡성이 과도하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 가파른 학습 곡선 때문에 원하는 결과물을 얻기까지 오랜 시간 시행착오를 겪어야 한다는 점도 큰 부담입니다.\n  팁! 전문적인 작업이 아니라면, 포토샵 대신 무료로 이용할 수 있는 다양한 대체 프로그램들도 많습니다. 하지만 AI 편집 도구는 그마저도 뛰어넘는 간편함을 제공하죠.\n  나노바나나의 등장: 이미지 편집의 새로운 기준\nGemini의 2.5 Flash 모델, 코드명 나노바나나(Nano Banana)는 이미지 편집의 패러다임을 완전히 바꾸고 있습니다. 이제 수백 개의 슬라이더와 도구를 조작하는 대신, 여러분이 원하는 변경 사항을 단순히 입력하거나 말하기만 하면 Gemini가 알아서 편집을 처리해 줍니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n간편함의 미학: 직관적인 AI 편집\n나노바나나를 사용하는 방법은 매우 간단합니다. 데스크톱에서 Gemini 웹사이트에 접속하거나 Gemini 앱을 열고 ‘이미지 생성(Create images)’ 모드를 선택합니다. 그 다음, “+” 아이콘을 눌러 편집하고 싶은 이미지를 업로드하고 원하는 편집 내용을 텍스트로 입력하기만 하면 됩니다. 정말 이보다 더 쉬울 수 있을까요?\n구독료도, 고사양 컴퓨터도 필요 없습니다. 그냥 원하는 편집을 Gemini에게 알려주기만 하면 끝입니다. 나노바나나는 특히 다음과 같은 작업에 매우 강력한 성능을 보여줍니다.\n기능\n설명\n\n\n\n\n객체 제거 및 추가\n사진 속 불필요한 요소를 지우거나 새로운 객체를 자연스럽게 추가합니다.\n\n\n배경 교체\n원하는 배경으로 사진의 분위기를 완전히 바꿀 수 있습니다.\n\n\n이미지 간 스타일 전환\n특정 이미지의 스타일을 다른 이미지에 적용하여 독특한 결과물을 만듭니다.\n\n\n색상 및 조명 조정\n사진의 색감과 밝기를 최적화하여 분위기를 살립니다.\n\n\n여러 사진 합성\n두 장 이상의 사진을 자연스럽게 하나로 합쳐줍니다.\n\n\n\n ️ 대화형 편집: 창의력의 날개를 달다\n나노바나나로 사진을 편집할 때 가장 매력적인 점은 바로 ‘다단계 대화형 편집’이 가능하다는 것입니다. 한 번의 프롬프트에서 모든 변경 사항을 지정할 필요 없이, 마치 친구와 대화하듯 편집을 이어나갈 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 첫 번째 요청으로 하늘을 바꾸고, 다음 요청으로 조명을 미세하게 조절하거나 배경 요소를 추가·삭제하는 식이죠.\n단계별 편집의 자유\n이러한 대화형 편집 방식은 여러분의 편집 경험 자체를 변화시킵니다. 더 이상 복잡한 도구와 기술 수준에 얽매이지 않고, 오롯이 자신의 창의적인 아이디어 구현에 집중할 수 있게 됩니다. 편집 속도가 빠르고 노력도 적게 들기 때문에, 다양한 아이디어를 주저 없이 시도해볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 장점입니다. 이제는 기술이 아니라 여러분의 창의적인 비전이 편집의 중심이 됩니다.\n음성 편집, 아직은 성장 중\n만약 타이핑이 번거롭다면, 음성 모드로 전환해 Gemini에게 말로 편집을 요청할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 제 경험상 아직 음성 모드는 완벽하게 작동하지는 않았습니다. 가끔 설명 없는 오류가 반복적으로 발생하곤 했어요. 원인은 알 수 없지만, 텍스트 입력은 언제나 안정적으로 작동했으니 참고하시면 좋겠습니다.\n✍️ 나노바나나 프롬프트, 이렇게 활용해 보세요!\n나노바나나의 AI 편집 능력은 여러분의 프롬프트에 달려있습니다. 원하는 결과를 얻기 위해서는 명확하고 구체적인 설명이 중요합니다. 다음은 효과적인 프롬프트를 작성하기 위한 몇 가지 팁입니다.\n구체적인 지시: 단순히 ‘배경을 바꿔줘’보다는 ‘배경을 울창한 열대우림으로 바꿔주고, 빛은 나뭇잎 사이로 스며드는 듯한 효과를 줘’와 같이 구체적으로 설명해주세요.\n명확한 목표: ‘사진을 더 밝게’보다는 ‘전체적으로 따뜻한 색감으로 밝기를 한 단계 올려줘’와 같이 목표를 명확히 제시합니다.\n단계별 접근: 복잡한 편집은 한 번에 처리하기보다 여러 단계로 나누어 요청하는 것이 좋습니다. 예를 들어, 먼저 객체를 제거하고, 그 다음 배경을 교체한 후, 마지막으로 색상 보정을 하는 식입니다.\n예시 활용: 특정 스타일이나 느낌을 원한다면, ‘인상주의 화풍으로 바꿔줘’처럼 예시를 들어 설명할 수도 있습니다.\n  팁! 처음에는 간단한 편집부터 시작하여 나노바나나의 작동 방식을 익히는 것이 좋습니다. 점점 더 복잡한 요청을 시도하며 여러분만의 노하우를 쌓아가세요!\n⏱️ 복잡한 작업도 순식간에: 시간 절약의 마법\n포토샵에서 배경을 바꾸는 단순한 작업조차 숙련자에게도 몇 분, 초보자에게는 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 레이어 작업이나 마스킹을 통해 객체를 제거하거나 배경을 교체하고, 요소를 옮기는 데 많은 집중과 시간이 필요하죠. 하지만 나노바나나에서는 같은 작업을 불과 몇 초 만에 끝낼 수 있습니다.\n제가 직접 경험한 일화가 있습니다. 친구가 자전거 사고를 당해서 병원에 있었고, 사고 난 자전거 사진을 보내주기를 원했어요. 손상된 자전거가 수리점으로 운반 중인 사진이었는데, 저는 나노바나나에게 사진을 산속에 주차된 것처럼 편집해 달라고 요청했습니다. 결과는 정말 놀라웠어요! 자전거와 헬멧까지 정확하게 표현했고, 심지어 그림자, 조명, 흙먼지까지 자연스럽게 반영되어 있었죠. 이 정도 편집을 포토샵에서 했다면 훨씬 오랜 시간이 걸렸을 뿐 아니라 반드시 책상 앞에 앉아 작업해야 했을 겁니다. 나노바나나는 워터마크 제거, 배경 교체, 객체 추가·삭제를 거의 요청과 동시에 수행해냅니다.\n✅ 일관성 유지: AI 편집의 신뢰성 확보\n기존 AI 편집 도구의 가장 큰 문제점 중 하나는 바로 ‘일관성’이었습니다. 특히 인물의 얼굴이나 주요 피사체가 편집 과정에서 미묘하게 바뀌어 버리는 경우가 많았죠. 나 자신이나 지인의 사진을 편집할 때 작은 변화만 있어도 어색하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 비슷하지만 똑같지 않은 AI 편집 결과물은 사실상 쓸모가 없었습니다.\n인물, 반려동물 사진 편집의 안정성\n하지만 구글은 Gemini, 특히 나노바나나를 개발하면서 이러한 문제점을 해결하는 데 집중했습니다. 나노바나나는 사람, 가족, 친구, 반려동물의 사진을 편집할 때 원래 모습의 일관성을 유지할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 따라서 어떤 편집을 하든 인물의 모습은 그대로 유지될 가능성이 매우 큽니다. 이제 AI가 임의로 추가하는 왜곡된 결과물이 아닌, 여러분이 지정한 편집만 정확히 반영된 결과물을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n여러 사진 합성도 자연스럽게\n이러한 일관성 유지 기능은 특히 여러 이미지를 합성하여 한 장의 결과물을 만들 때 더욱 유용합니다. 두 장의 사진 속에 있던 사람들이 하나의 프레임에 함께 있어도 각자의 모습이 자연스럽게 유지되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이제 여러분의 소중한 추억을 AI의 도움으로 더욱 아름답게 만들 수 있습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 간편한 접근성: 포토샵과 달리 고사양 PC나 유료 구독 없이 Gemini 웹사이트나 앱에서 즉시 이용 가능합니다.\n✅ 직관적인 대화형 편집: 복잡한 도구 없이 자연어 프롬프트(텍스트 또는 음성)로 원하는 편집을 명령할 수 있습니다.\n✅ 시간 절약과 효율성: 배경 교체, 객체 제거 등 복잡한 작업도 수 초 만에 처리하여 작업 시간을 혁신적으로 단축합니다.\n✅ 일관성 유지: 인물이나 주요 피사체의 원래 모습을 정확히 보존하며, 여러 사진 합성 시에도 자연스러운 결과물을 제공합니다.\n나노바나나는 전문가뿐만 아니라 일반 사용자에게도 사진 편집의 즐거움을 선사하는 강력한 도구입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n ️ 대화형 편집: 창의력의 날개를 달다\n1.  애니메이션을 실제 모델로 변경\nGenerate a photo of a girl cosplaying this illustration, with the background set at Comiket\n\n\n \n2.  다양한 헤어스타일로 변경\n\n\nGenerate avatars of this person with different hairstyles in a 3x3 grid format\n \n 3.  드로잉과 사진의 합성\n\n\nChange the pose of the person in Figure 1 to that of Figure 2, and shoot in a professional studio\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 나노바나나는 포토샵을 완전히 대체할 수 있나요?\nA1: 나노바나나는 일반적인 사진 편집 작업을 매우 쉽고 빠르게 처리하여 포토샵의 필요성을 크게 줄여줍니다. 하지만 그래픽 디자인이나 고도로 정밀한 수작업이 필요한 전문적인 작업에서는 여전히 포토샵이 주된 도구로 사용될 수 있습니다. 나노바나나는 포토샵의 훌륭한 대안이자 보완재 역할을 합니다.\nQ2: 나노바나나를 사용하려면 별도 프로그램 설치나 구독이 필요한가요?\nA2: 아니요, Gemini의 2.5 Flash 모델인 나노바나나는 Gemini 웹사이트나 앱에서 ‘이미지 생성’ 모드를 통해 바로 사용할 수 있습니다. 별도의 프로그램 설치나 유료 구독 없이 무료로 주요 편집 기능을 이용할 수 있어 접근성이 매우 뛰어납니다.\nQ3: AI 편집 시 인물이나 배경이 부자연스러워지지는 않나요?\nA3: 나노바나나는 인물, 가족, 친구, 반려동물 등의 주요 피사체를 편집할 때 원래 모습의 일관성을 유지하도록 설계되었습니다. 배경 교체나 객체 추가 시에도 자연스러운 그림자, 조명, 질감을 반영하여 전체적인 조화를 해치지 않는 뛰어난 결과물을 제공합니다.\n포토샵은 여전히 그래픽 디자이너와 전문 사진작가들의 강력한 도구로 남을 것입니다. 하지만 Gemini의 나노바나나는 훌륭한 대안이자 혁신적인 미래를 제시합니다. 복잡한 제어나 기술적인 도구 다루는 것에 어려움을 느끼는 분들에게, 나노바나나는 사진을 쉽고 빠르게 원하는 대로 편집할 수 있는 최고의 도구가 될 것입니다. 지금 바로 나노바나나로 여러분의 사진 편집 경험을 한 단계 업그레이드해보세요!\n\n \n나노바나나를 가장 스마트하게 사용하는 법. 바나나 캔버스 무료 공개\nAI 이미지 생성과 편집의 새로운 지평을 연 구글의 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image, 일명 나노바나나를 가장 스마트하게 활용하는 법을 소개합니다. 특히 나노바나나의 강력한 기능을 누구나 쉽게 사용할\nmuzbox.tistory.com",

(2가지 경로)\n이 GEM은 분석의 시작에서부터 아주 똑똑하게 접근해요. 먼저 오디오 파일의 주된 콘텐츠가 음성인지 음악인지 판별하는 '오디오 유형 식별' 단계를 거칩니다. 그리고 그 결과에 따라 최적화된 분석 경로를 선택해 진행하게 되죠. 마치 길을 잘 아는 전문가처럼요.\n경로 A: 음성 기반 오디오 분석\n회의록, 인터뷰, 강의 녹음본 같은 음성 기반 오디오는 정말 중요한 정보를 담고 있죠. 이 GEM은 단순히 받아쓰기하는 것을 넘어, 대화의 본질을 파악합니다.\n✅ 내용 분석: 3~5문장의 핵심 요약부터 주요 주제, 키워드 추출, 그리고 가장 중요한 실행 항목 및 결정 사항(담당자, 기한 포함)까지 리스트업 해줍니다. 심지어 오디오에 포함된 모든 음성 대화를 화자 분리까지 완벽하게 변환하여 전문으로 제공해요.\n✅ 감성 및 표현 방식 분석: 대화의 전반적인 감정, 화자별 감정 변화, 어조(Tone) 분석은 물론, 발화 속도, 리듬, 의미 있는 침묵, 필러 단어 사용 빈도 같은 비언어적 요소까지 분석하여 그 의미를 추론해줍니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n✅ 기술 및 환경 분석: 사용된 언어, 총 화자 수, 재생 시간은 물론, 배경 소음이나 웃음, 기침 같은 특정 음향 이벤트까지 식별하고 오디오 선명도 같은 기술적 품질까지 평가해줍니다.\n✅ 종합 인사이트: 이 모든 분석을 바탕으로 내용, 감정, 표현 방식을 아우르는 최종적인 통찰력과 결론을 제공하니, 그냥 회의록을 읽는 것과는 차원이 다르죠.\n\n\n경로 B: 음악 기반 오디오 분석\n음악은 복잡한 예술 형태인데, 이걸 어떻게 분석할까 궁금하셨을 거예요. 이 GEM은 음악의 아주 미묘한 부분까지 파고듭니다.\n✅ 음악 개요 및 핵심 특징: 추정 장르, 분위기, 주요 악기 구성은 기본이고, BPM, 박자표, 리듬 특징, 화성 및 조성(키, 스케일, 코드 진행)까지 상세하게 해석해줍니다.\n✅ 내용 및 구조 분석: 보컬이 있다면 가사 전문을 완벽하게 변환하고, 연주곡일 경우 명확히 알려줘요. 곡의 구조를 인트로, 벌스, 코러스 등으로 자동 분할하고 각 구간의 특징까지 설명해줍니다.\n✅ 사운드 및 악기 분석: 정말 신기한 부분인데요, Spectral Centroid (밝기), Spectral Bandwidth (대역폭), Zero Crossing Rate (타격감/고주파 잡음), Spectral Rolloff (고역 에너지) 같은 스펙트럼 특징값을 분석해서 각 값이 음색에 미치는 영향을 설명하고, 이를 토대로 주요 악기까지 추정하고 분류해준답니다.\n✅ 음악적 특성 및 기술 사양: 스포티파이 스타일의 에너지, 댄스 가능성, 정서적 밝기 같은 음악적 특성과 총 길이, 샘플레이트, 채널 같은 기본 기술 사양도 기록해요.\n  시각적 분석: 파형, 스펙트로그램, 구조 시각화\n이 GEM의 또 다른 강점은 분석 결과를 시각적으로 보여준다는 거예요. 시간에 따른 음량 변화를 파형으로 시각화해주고, 시간에 따른 주파수 분포를 보여주는 스펙트로그램으로 저음, 중음, 고음역대의 에너지 분포를 한눈에 파악할 수 있게 해줍니다. 음악의 구조(인트로, 코러스 등)도 타임라인 위에 시각적으로 표시해주니, 정말 직관적이고 이해하기 쉬웠어요.\n  놓치지 마세요: 단순히 텍스트 분석이 아닌, 시각화를 통해 오디오의 복잡한 정보를 더욱 명확하게 전달한다는 점이 이 GEM의 차별점입니다!\n  왜 이 GEM 지침이 게임 체인저일까요?\nGemini에서 오디오 파일 업로드를 지원하게 되면서, 이런 통합 분석 GEM 지침이 탄생했다는 것은 정말 큰 의미가 있습니다. 제 생각엔 이 GEM은 단순히 새로운 도구가 아니라, 우리가 오디오 데이터를 다루는 방식 자체를 바꿀 수 있는 게임 체인저라고 생각해요. 개발자, 연구자, 콘텐츠 크리에이터 모두에게 엄청난 잠재력을 열어줄 것이 분명합니다.\n  복잡한 분석의 간소화: 수동으로 진행하기 어렵고 시간이 많이 드는 음성 및 음악 분석 작업을 GEM이 한 번에 처리해줍니다.\n  새로운 인사이트 발굴: 기존에는 놓쳤을 법한 비언어적 요소나 스펙트럼 특징값 분석을 통해 더욱 깊이 있는 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n  접근성의 확대: 전문가가 아닌 일반 사용자도 복잡한 오디오 분석을 손쉽게 수행할 수 있게 됩니다.\n  시각화를 통한 이해 증진: 복잡한 데이터를 직관적인 시각 자료로 제공하여 이해도를 높여줍니다.\n⚠️ 주의: 강력한 도구인 만큼, 분석 결과는 사용자의 목적과 맥락에 맞춰 신중하게 해석하고 활용해야 합니다. 인공지능의 분석은 참고 자료로 활용하며 최종적인 판단은 항상 사람이 해야 한다는 점을 잊지 마세요!\n  통합 오디오 분석 GEM 지침, 지금 바로 무료로 만나보세요!\n이처럼 혁신적인 '통합 오디오 분석 GEM 지침'을 여러분께 무료로 배포한다는 소식은 정말 반갑죠.

있다.\n다만, 지금의 우리는 교육으로 글로벌 시장을 노리는 것으로 에너지를 집중하고 있다.\n3개 꼭지점을 모두 다 달성한 플랫폼은 국내/국외 어디에도 없다.\n아마도 가장 근접한 건 링크드인이다.\n커뮤니티와 채용에 있어서는 세계 최고가 되었고, 린다닷컴을 인수해서 교육쪽으로도 계속해서 시도하고 있으니 말이다.\n국내에서는 확실하게 이 영역을 모두 확보한 플랫폼이 없다.\n하지만 많은 커리어 플랫폼이 이 영역들을 확보하기 위해 도전하고 있다.\n그러다보니 퍼블리를 비롯해 비슷한 결의 서비스들은 어떻게 시도하는지 자주 지켜봤다.\n마침 퍼블리에는 좋아하는 콘텐츠들도 많았어서 구독제 멤버십도 가입해서 자주 사용했다.\n\n\n퍼블리를 자주 이용하던 중,\n개발자들을 위한 SNS 서비스 '커리어리'를 시작한다는 소식을 들었다.\n'위하이어' 라는 ATS 서비스를 시작하신다는 것도 들었다.\n그리고 어느 순간 퍼블리에 읽고 싶은 콘텐츠가 더이상 추가되지 않았다.\n내 취향의 콘텐츠가 없다보니 얼마되지 않는 그 구독료도 아까웠다.\n그래서 훨씬 더 내 취향인 폴인의 구독을 시작했고, 지금까지도 연간 구독으로 계속해서 콘텐츠를 보고 있다.\n2023년엔 대표인 쭈와 함께 박소령 대표님, 이승국 CPO님과 함께 저녁식사를 먹으면서 스타트업에 대한 이야기를 나누기도 했다.\n커리어리와 위하이어로 개발자와 채용에 관해서 집중하신다는 것도 알게 됐다.\n그래서 어떤 과정으로 퍼블리와 그 외 서비스들이 시작했는지, 비중은 어떻게 되는지, 시리즈 B 투자로 받은 135억을 어떻게 활용하셨는지 등등 많이 궁금했었다.\n한국 콘텐츠 스타트업에서 퍼블리가 남긴 족적은 분명히 크다.\n그래서 퍼블리가 어떻게 10년을 보내왔는지 그 기록이 너무나 중요하다고 생각했는데, 이번에 이렇게 책으로 정리해주셔서 정말 감사했다.\n금, 토 이틀만에 다 읽으면서 지금 스타트업 시리즈 A, B 단계의 회사에서는 이 노트가 얼마나 귀한 기록인지 감사한 마음뿐이다.\nVC와의 관계와 투자는 어떻게 진행해야하는지,\n투자 받은 자금을 어떻게 활용해야하는지,\n레이오프는 어떻게 해야 덜 후회하고 앞으로를 위해 도움이 되는지 등등.\n아직 유니콘이 되지 못한 스타트업에 다니시는 분들이라면 무조건 적으로 읽어보시라고 추천하고 싶다.\n책 제목이 \"실패를 통과하는 일\"이다.\n인프런은 꼭 통과하지 않기로 몇번이고 다짐했다.\n책 속 문장\n매월 달성해야하는 재무 목표는 곧 매주, 매일의 목표로도 환산되기에 업무 우선순위에 대한 감각이 더 예민해지면서 긴장감을 가질 수 있었음.\n팀과 커뮤니케이션을 할 때도 단순히 \"BEP를 달성하자\"가 아니라 \"2023년 4월에 ㅇㅇ곳의 신규고객사가 ㅇㅇ원을 결제해서 매출이 00원 발생하면 BEP를 덜상할 수 있으니 집중하자\" 라고 말하면,

데에는 엄청난 노력을 쏟으면서 기대치를 관리하는 데에는 거의 신경을 쓰지 않는 것은 말이 안된다.\n특히 우리가 훨씬 더 쉽게 통제할 수 있는 것은 현실이 아닌 기대치이므로 더욱 그렇다.\n...\n정말로 원하는 것은 기대한 것과 실제 결과의 차이를 경험하는 일이다.\n우리는 기대한 것보다 더 좋은 결과를 얻었을 때 만족과 성취감을 느낀다.\n커리어

Kubernetes에서 컨테이너를 실행할 때는 Pod를 사용하는데요. Pod를 사용할 때 컨테이너의 리소스를 얼마나 할당할 것인가는 클러스터의 안정성과 연결되어 있기 때문에 중요한 문제 중 하나입니다. Pod의 컴퓨팅 리소스는 보통 다음과 같이 **requests**와 **limit**으로 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: v1\r\r\nkind: Pod\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: frontend\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  containers:\r\r\n  - name: app\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n  - name: log-aggregator\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n리소스를 설정할 때 우리는 보통 메모리를 중심으로 정하는데요, 컨테이너의 메모리 사용량이 한계값에 도달하면 Pod는 재실행됩니다.\r\r\n그렇다면, CPU 사용량의 경우에는 어떨까요? 자주 사용되진 않지만 한 번쯤 알아두면 좋은 CPU 사용량 제한에 대해 알아보았습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## Kubernetes CPU Resource 설정\r\r\n먼저 Pod의 Resource 항목에서 설정 가능한 CPU의 Request와 Limit, 그리고 단위에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU Requests\r\r\nCPU requests는 컨테이너가 정상적으로 실행하기 위한 최소한의 CPU 양을 의미합니다. requests는 kube-scheduler가 Pod를 노드에 할당하는 스케줄링 작업에서 사용합니다. kube-scheduler는 Pod의 requests 값을 합산하여 할당 가능한 노드를 찾아서 Pod를 배치합니다. 노드에 Pod의 requests를 수용할 만한 여유가 있어야 할당이 되는 것이죠. 이 조건을 만족하는 노드가 없다면 Pod는 pending 상태로 스케줄링되지 않습니다.\r\r\nPod가 특정 노드에 스케줄링되었다면 요청된 CPU의 양은 보장됩니다. 이 말은 requests의 양만큼 CPU를 항상 점유한다는 뜻은 아닙니다. CPU 사용에 경합이 발생했을 때도 요청한 만큼의 CPU 시간을 할당 받는 것을 보장합니다. requests의 값이 없다면 Pod가 비효율적으로 배치될 수 있고 필요 이상의 클러스터 자원을 사용하여 불필요한 비용 지출이 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU Limits\r\r\nCPU limits는 컨테이너가 사용할 수 있는 CPU의 절대적인 최댓값을 의미하며 kubelet이 관리합니다. Pod의 컨테이너가 limits를 초과하여 CPU를 사용하려 할 때 해당 컨테이너의 CPU 사용을 인위적으로 낮추는 스로틀링(Throttling)을 통해 상한선을 강제합니다. limits는 여러 서비스가 동시에 실행되고 있는 Kubernetes 클러스터에서 하나의 컨테이너가 CPU를 과점하여 다른 컨테이너의 성능에 영향을 주거나 노드의 안정성을 해치는 CPU 기아 상태를 방지하는 데 의미가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. CPU Unit\r\r\nKubernetes에서 CPU의 단위는 절대적인 양으로 사용되며 1 Kubernetes CPU는 1vCPU 또는 물리적인 1 CPU 코어의 컴퓨팅 파워와 동일한 것으로 간주합니다.\r\r\nKubernetes에서는 코어를 밀리코어(millicore)로 더 작게 나누어 설정할 수 있습니다. 1000m은 1 CPU와 동일하며 0.5 CPU는 500m과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 4. QoS(quality of service, 서비스 품질) 클래스\r\r\nKubernetes는 설정한 requests와 limits에 따라서 자동으로 QoS 클래스를 할당합니다.\r\r\n• **Guaranteed (보장)**: Pod 내의 모든 컨테이너가 CPU와 메모리에 대해 requests와 limits를 모두 설정하고, 그 값이 서로 동일할 때(requests.cpu == limits.cpu) 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 높은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드에 리소스 압박이 발생했을 때 가장 마지막에 축출(eviction)됩니다.\r\r\n• **Burstable (버스트 가능)**: Pod 내에 최소 하나 이상의 컨테이너가 CPU 또는 메모리 requests를 설정했지만, Guaranteed 클래스의 조건을 충족하지 못할 때 할당됩니다(예: requests.cpu < limits.cpu). 이 Pod들은 노드에 여유 리소스가 있을 경우, 요청한 양보다 더 많은 리소스를 \"버스트(burst)\"하여 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n• **BestEffort (최선 노력)**: Pod 내의 어떤 컨테이너도 CPU나 메모리에 대한 requests나 limits를 설정하지 않았을 때 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 낮은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드 리소스가 부족해지면 가장 먼저 축출 대상이 됩니다. \r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 리눅스 커널의 CPU 관리 메커니즘\r\r\nKubernetes에서 설정한 requests와 limits를 리눅스 커널이 어떻게 실제로 CPU를 할당하고 제한하는지 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 여기에는 컨테이너 기술을 탄생시킨 cgroup(Control Group)과 CFS(Completely Fair Scheduler)가 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. 리눅스 컨트롤 그룹(cgroup)\r\r\ncgroup은 프로세스들의 집합에 대해 CPU, 메모리, I/O와 같은 시스템 리소스의 사용량을 제한하고, 추적하며, 격리합니다. cgroup은 /sys/fs/cgroup/이라는 가상 파일 시스템 내에 계층적 구조로 구성됩니다. Kubernetes는 이 구조 내에 kubepods.slice라는 전용 경로를 만들어 Pod들의 리소스를 관리합니다.\r\r\nCPU 리소스 관리를 담당하는 cgroup의 특정 모듈을 ‘컨트롤러’ 또는 ‘서브시스템’이라 부르며, Kubernetes가 CPU requests와 limits를 구현하기 위해 사용하는 것이 바로 CPU 서브시스템입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. Completely Fair Scheduler(CFS)\r\r\nCFS는 리눅스 커널의 기본 프로세스 스케줄러로, 그 이름처럼 ‘완전한 공정성’을 목표로 합니다. CFS는 마치 ‘이상적인 멀티태스킹 CPU’가 존재하는 것처럼, 실행 가능한 모든 태스크(프로세스)가 정확히 동일한 비율의 CPU 시간을 할당 받도록 노력합니다.\r\r\n실제 하드웨어는 한 번에 하나의 작업만 실행할 수 있기 때문에, CFS는 ‘가상 런타임(virtual runtime, vruntime)’이라는 개념을 사용합니다. CFS는 항상 가장 작은 vruntime 값을 가진 작업, 즉 지금까지 가장 적게 실행된 작업을 선택하여 실행함으로써 장기적인 관점에서 공정성을 보장합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. Kubernetes와 커널의 매핑\r\r\nkubelet은 Kubernetes의 yaml 명세를 실제 커널에 적용하기 위해서 변환 작업을 수행합니다. kubelet은 resources 설정을 읽어 해당 컨테이너의 cgroup 디렉터리 내 특정 파일에 값을 덮어쓰는 방식으로 커널에 지시를 내립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.1. Requests와 cpu.shares: 상대적 가중치 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.requests.cpu 값은 cgroup의 cpu.shares 파일 값으로 변환됩니다. 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.shares=requests.cpu (millicores)×1024/1000.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, 1000m(1 코어) 요청은 1024 shares로, 500m 요청은 512 shares로 변환됩니다. 가장 중요한 점은 cpu.shares가 **노드에 CPU 경합이 있을 때만 의미를 가지는 상대적 가중치**라는 것입니다. 만약 CPU 자원을 두고 경쟁하는 두 컨테이너가 있고, 하나는 2048 shares, 다른 하나는 1024 shares를 가지고 있다면, 전자는 후자보다 두 배의 CPU 시간을 할당 받게 됩니다. 하지만 노드가 유휴 상태이고 CPU 경합이 없다면, 컨테이너는 자신의 shares 값과 무관하게 필요한 만큼의 CPU를 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.2. Limits와 cpu.cfs_period_us & cpu.cfs_quota_us: 절대적 시간 할당량 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.limits.cpu 값은 CFS 대역폭 제어라는 메커니즘을 통해 강제됩니다. 이 메커니즘은 두 가지 파라미터에 의해서 결정됩니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_period_us: 할당량을 정산하는 주기로 단위는 마이크로초입니다. Kubernetes는 기본값인 100000(즉 100ms)을 사용합니다. 이 한 window 내에서 할당량이 정해집니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_quota_us: 위에서 정의된 period 동안 cgroup이 소비할 수 있는 총 CPU 시간을 정의합니다. 단위는 마이크로초입니다. 이 값은 resources.limitscpu로부터 계산됩니다. limits가 없을 경우 -1로 할당량 없음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n변환 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.cfs_quota_us=limits.cpu (cores)×cpu.cfs_period_us.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, limits.cpu를 500m(0.5 코어)로 설정하면, cpu.cfs_quota_us=0.5×100000=50000이 됩니다. 이는 해당 컨테이너가 매 100ms 주기마다 최대 50,000 마이크로초(50ms)의 CPU 시간만 사용할 수 있음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 요약\r\r\n| Kubernetes 설정 | Kubernetes에서의 목적 | 리눅스 cgroup 파일 | 동작 |\r\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\r\n| resources.requests.cpu | 스케줄링 및 경합 시 최소 CPU 보장 | cpu.shares | 상대적 가중치; CPU 경합 시에만 활성화 |\r\r\n| resources.lmits.cpu | 런타임 시 최대 CPU사용량 제한 | cpu.cfs_quota_us | 절대적 시간 할당량; 항상 활성화, 스로틀링 발생 |\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## Limits 적용으로 발생할 수 있는 현상\r\r\nCPU limits를 설정했을 때 발생하는 가장 중요하고 종종 오해 받는 현상이 바로 CPU 스로틀링입니다. 스로틀링은 단순히 성능을 약간 늦추는 것이 아니라, 애플리케이션의 지연 시간에 심각하고 예측 불가능한 영향을 미칠 수 있는 ‘정지-대기(stop-wait)’ 프로세스입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU 스로틀링과 발생 원인\r\r\nCPU 스로틀링은 컨테이너 내의 프로세스들이 현재의 cfs_period_us(보통 100ms) 동안 할당된 cfs_quota_us를 모두 소진했을 때 발생합니다. 할당량을 모두 사용한 컨테이너의 프로세스들은 커널 스케줄러에 의해 실행이 '정지'됩니다. 그리고 다음 100ms 주기가 시작되어 할당량이 다시 채워질 때까지 대기해야 합니다.\r\r\n이 현상은 특히 멀티 스레드 애플리케이션에서 증폭되어 나타납니다. 예를 들어, 한 컨테이너가 1 코어(cfs_quota_us=100000)의 limit을 가지고 있지만, 4개의 바쁜 스레드를 동시에 실행한다고 가정해 봅시다.\r\r\n이 컨테이너는 4개의 코어를 동시에 사용하여 단 25ms의 실제 시간만에 100ms의 CPU 시간 할당량을 모두 소진할 수 있습니다. 그 후, 해당 컨테이너는 남은 75ms 동안 노드에 유휴 코어가 있더라도 완전히 스로틀링되어 아무 작업도 수행할 수 없게 됩니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit1.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit2.png)\r\r\n스로틀링은 애플리케이션 요청 처리 시간에 직접적으로 지연을 추가합니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 작업을 완료하는 데 순수하게 300ms의 CPU 시간이 필요한 애플리케이션이 100ms 주기당 50ms의 limit에 의해 제한된다고 가정해 봅시다. 이 작업은 다른 시스템 부하가 전혀 없더라도 최소 6개의 주기, 즉 600ms의 실제 시간이 걸려야 완료될 수 있습니다. 이러한 지연은 타임아웃, 연쇄적인 장애, 그리고 궁극적으로는 나쁜 사용자 경험으로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n스로틀링은 전통적인 CPU 사용률 지표로는 확인하기가 힘든 경우가 있습니다. 어떤 컨테이너가 CPU 사용률 50%(자신의 limit 값)를 보이고 있더라도, 실제로는 심각하게 스로틀링되어 매우 느린 상태일 수 있습니다. 이 경우 CPU는 전통적인 의미에서 '최대치로 사용'되는 것이 아니라, 인위적으로 억제되고 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. '시끄러운 이웃' 오해\r\r\nlimits가 ‘시끄러운 이웃(noisy neighbor)’ 문제, 즉 하나의 애플리케이션이 리소스를 독점하여 다른 애플리케이션에 영향을 주는 것을 막아 줄 수 있을 것처럼 보입니다. 하지만 실제로는 requests에 의해 결정되는 cpu.shares가 경합 상황에서도 적절하게 리소스를 배분할 수 있는 시스템이라고 할 수 있습니다. 만약 모든 Pod에 적절한 requests가 설정되어 있다면, CFS 스케줄러는 shares 값에 비례하여 CPU 시간을 분배함으로써 특정 Pod가 다른 Pod들이 기아 상태에 빠지는 것을 방지합니다. 반면 limits는 다른 누구도 CPU를 필요로 하지 않는 상황에서조차 Pod의 사용량을 제한하는 무딘 도구에 가깝습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 스로틀링 테스트\r\r\n테스트를 위해 한 웹 애플리케이션을 만들었습니다. 이 애플리케이션에 1 CPU를 할당하면 작업을 완료하는 데 대략 12초 정도 걸립니다.\r\r\n이 애플리케이션에 각각 1 CPU, 0.1 CPU를 할당하여 CPU 사용량과 작업 시간을 확인하여 지금까지 확인한 현상이 발생하는지 테스트해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 테스트용 Pod 준비\r\r\n아래와 같이 CPU limit만 다르게 설정하여 Pod를 생성하였습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8081\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n---\r\r\n# 1 코어 제한 버전\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8080\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 응답 시간 비교\r\r\n0.1 CPU를 할당한 애플리케이션에서는 122초가 소요된 반면 1 CPU가 할당된 애플리케이션에서는 11.51초만 소요된 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 그라파나를 통한 스로틀링 현상 확인\r\r\n* <span style=\"background-color:#DCFFE4\">초록색: 1 CPU</span>\r\r\n* <span style=\"background-color:#fff5b1\">노란색: 0.1 CPU</span>\r\r\n\r\r\nCPU 사용률에서 노란색 그래프가 CPU limits가 0.1로 설정되어 그 이상 사용하지 못하는 모습을 보여줍니다. CPU 할당 횟수에서 노란색이 Limits에 걸려서 더 많은 cpu 할당이 발생한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이것은 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가 시뮬레이션과 일치하는 결과입니다. 당연하게도 스로틀링 비율도 노란색이 더 높은 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit4.png)\r\r\n중요한 지표는 스로틀링 비율로서 비율이 5%를 지속적으로 넘는 현상이 발생한다면 스로틀링이 빈번하게 발생하여 성능에 제약을 받아 서비스가 느려져 있을 가능성이 있으므로 조치를 취해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 스로틀링 비율 지표 예시\r\r\n```\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n/\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 나가며\r\r\n결론은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n* 일반적인 경우,\r\r\n\t* request만 설정하여 자원이 더 필요할 때는 노드의 가용 자원을 사용하고 자원이 모자랄 때는 비율로 할당 받도록 하는 것이 좋은 것 같습니다.

Kubernetes에서 컨테이너를 실행할 때는 Pod를 사용하는데요. Pod를 사용할 때 컨테이너의 리소스를 얼마나 할당할 것인가는 클러스터의 안정성과 연결되어 있기 때문에 중요한 문제 중 하나입니다. Pod의 컴퓨팅 리소스는 보통 다음과 같이 **requests**와 **limit**으로 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: v1\r\r\nkind: Pod\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: frontend\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  containers:\r\r\n  - name: app\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n  - name: log-aggregator\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n리소스를 설정할 때 우리는 보통 메모리를 중심으로 정하는데요, 컨테이너의 메모리 사용량이 한계값에 도달하면 Pod는 재실행됩니다.\r\r\n그렇다면, CPU 사용량의 경우에는 어떨까요? 자주 사용되진 않지만 한 번쯤 알아두면 좋은 CPU 사용량 제한에 대해 알아보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Kubernetes CPU Resource 설정\r\r\n먼저 Pod의 Resource 항목에서 설정 가능한 CPU의 Request와 Limit, 그리고 단위에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU Requests\r\r\nCPU requests는 컨테이너가 정상적으로 실행하기 위한 최소한의 CPU 양을 의미합니다. requests는 kube-scheduler가 Pod를 노드에 할당하는 스케줄링 작업에서 사용합니다. kube-scheduler는 Pod의 requests 값을 합산하여 할당 가능한 노드를 찾아서 Pod를 배치합니다. 노드에 Pod의 requests를 수용할 만한 여유가 있어야 할당이 되는 것이죠. 이 조건을 만족하는 노드가 없다면 Pod는 pending 상태로 스케줄링되지 않습니다.\r\r\nPod가 특정 노드에 스케줄링되었다면 요청된 CPU의 양은 보장됩니다. 이 말은 requests의 양만큼 CPU를 항상 점유한다는 뜻은 아닙니다. CPU 사용에 경합이 발생했을 때도 요청한 만큼의 CPU 시간을 할당 받는 것을 보장합니다. requests의 값이 없다면 Pod가 비효율적으로 배치될 수 있고 필요 이상의 클러스터 자원을 사용하여 불필요한 비용 지출이 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU Limits\r\r\nCPU limits는 컨테이너가 사용할 수 있는 CPU의 절대적인 최댓값을 의미하며 kubelet이 관리합니다. Pod의 컨테이너가 limits를 초과하여 CPU를 사용하려 할 때 해당 컨테이너의 CPU 사용을 인위적으로 낮추는 스로틀링(Throttling)을 통해 상한선을 강제합니다. limits는 여러 서비스가 동시에 실행되고 있는 Kubernetes 클러스터에서 하나의 컨테이너가 CPU를 과점하여 다른 컨테이너의 성능에 영향을 주거나 노드의 안정성을 해치는 CPU 기아 상태를 방지하는 데 의미가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. CPU Unit\r\r\nKubernetes에서 CPU의 단위는 절대적인 양으로 사용되며 1 Kubernetes CPU는 1vCPU 또는 물리적인 1 CPU 코어의 컴퓨팅 파워와 동일한 것으로 간주합니다.\r\r\nKubernetes에서는 코어를 밀리코어(millicore)로 더 작게 나누어 설정할 수 있습니다. 1000m은 1 CPU와 동일하며 0.5 CPU는 500m과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 4. QoS(quality of service, 서비스 품질) 클래스\r\r\nKubernetes는 설정한 requests와 limits에 따라서 자동으로 QoS 클래스를 할당합니다.\r\r\n• **Guaranteed (보장)**: Pod 내의 모든 컨테이너가 CPU와 메모리에 대해 requests와 limits를 모두 설정하고, 그 값이 서로 동일할 때(requests.cpu == limits.cpu) 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 높은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드에 리소스 압박이 발생했을 때 가장 마지막에 축출(eviction)됩니다.\r\r\n• **Burstable (버스트 가능)**: Pod 내에 최소 하나 이상의 컨테이너가 CPU 또는 메모리 requests를 설정했지만, Guaranteed 클래스의 조건을 충족하지 못할 때 할당됩니다(예: requests.cpu < limits.cpu). 이 Pod들은 노드에 여유 리소스가 있을 경우, 요청한 양보다 더 많은 리소스를 \"버스트(burst)\"하여 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n• **BestEffort (최선 노력)**: Pod 내의 어떤 컨테이너도 CPU나 메모리에 대한 requests나 limits를 설정하지 않았을 때 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 낮은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드 리소스가 부족해지면 가장 먼저 축출 대상이 됩니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n## 리눅스 커널의 CPU 관리 메커니즘\r\r\nKubernetes에서 설정한 requests와 limits를 리눅스 커널이 어떻게 실제로 CPU를 할당하고 제한하는지 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 여기에는 컨테이너 기술을 탄생시킨 cgroup(Control Group)과 CFS(Completely Fair Scheduler)가 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. 리눅스 컨트롤 그룹(cgroup)\r\r\ncgroup은 프로세스들의 집합에 대해 CPU, 메모리, I/O와 같은 시스템 리소스의 사용량을 제한하고, 추적하며, 격리합니다. cgroup은 /sys/fs/cgroup/이라는 가상 파일 시스템 내에 계층적 구조로 구성됩니다. Kubernetes는 이 구조 내에 kubepods.slice라는 전용 경로를 만들어 Pod들의 리소스를 관리합니다.\r\r\nCPU 리소스 관리를 담당하는 cgroup의 특정 모듈을 ‘컨트롤러’ 또는 ‘서브시스템’이라 부르며, Kubernetes가 CPU requests와 limits를 구현하기 위해 사용하는 것이 바로 CPU 서브시스템입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. Completely Fair Scheduler(CFS)\r\r\nCFS는 리눅스 커널의 기본 프로세스 스케줄러로, 그 이름처럼 ‘완전한 공정성’을 목표로 합니다. CFS는 마치 ‘이상적인 멀티태스킹 CPU’가 존재하는 것처럼, 실행 가능한 모든 태스크(프로세스)가 정확히 동일한 비율의 CPU 시간을 할당 받도록 노력합니다.\r\r\n실제 하드웨어는 한 번에 하나의 작업만 실행할 수 있기 때문에, CFS는 ‘가상 런타임(virtual runtime, vruntime)’이라는 개념을 사용합니다. CFS는 항상 가장 작은 vruntime 값을 가진 작업, 즉 지금까지 가장 적게 실행된 작업을 선택하여 실행함으로써 장기적인 관점에서 공정성을 보장합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. Kubernetes와 커널의 매핑\r\r\nkubelet은 Kubernetes의 yaml 명세를 실제 커널에 적용하기 위해서 변환 작업을 수행합니다. kubelet은 resources 설정을 읽어 해당 컨테이너의 cgroup 디렉터리 내 특정 파일에 값을 덮어쓰는 방식으로 커널에 지시를 내립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.1. Requests와 cpu.shares: 상대적 가중치 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.requests.cpu 값은 cgroup의 cpu.shares 파일 값으로 변환됩니다. 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.shares=requests.cpu (millicores)×1024/1000.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, 1000m(1 코어) 요청은 1024 shares로, 500m 요청은 512 shares로 변환됩니다. 가장 중요한 점은 cpu.shares가 **노드에 CPU 경합이 있을 때만 의미를 가지는 상대적 가중치**라는 것입니다. 만약 CPU 자원을 두고 경쟁하는 두 컨테이너가 있고, 하나는 2048 shares, 다른 하나는 1024 shares를 가지고 있다면, 전자는 후자보다 두 배의 CPU 시간을 할당 받게 됩니다. 하지만 노드가 유휴 상태이고 CPU 경합이 없다면, 컨테이너는 자신의 shares 값과 무관하게 필요한 만큼의 CPU를 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.2. Limits와 cpu.cfs_period_us & cpu.cfs_quota_us: 절대적 시간 할당량 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.limits.cpu 값은 CFS 대역폭 제어라는 메커니즘을 통해 강제됩니다. 이 메커니즘은 두 가지 파라미터에 의해서 결정됩니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_period_us: 할당량을 정산하는 주기로 단위는 마이크로초입니다. Kubernetes는 기본값인 100000(즉 100ms)을 사용합니다. 이 한 window 내에서 할당량이 정해집니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_quota_us: 위에서 정의된 period 동안 cgroup이 소비할 수 있는 총 CPU 시간을 정의합니다. 단위는 마이크로초입니다. 이 값은 resources.limitscpu로부터 계산됩니다. limits가 없을 경우 -1로 할당량 없음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n변환 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.cfs_quota_us=limits.cpu (cores)×cpu.cfs_period_us.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, limits.cpu를 500m(0.5 코어)로 설정하면, cpu.cfs_quota_us=0.5×100000=50000이 됩니다. 이는 해당 컨테이너가 매 100ms 주기마다 최대 50,000 마이크로초(50ms)의 CPU 시간만 사용할 수 있음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 요약\r\r\n| Kubernetes 설정 | Kubernetes에서의 목적 | 리눅스 cgroup 파일 | 동작 |\r\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\r\n| resources.requests.cpu | 스케줄링 및 경합 시 최소 CPU 보장 | cpu.shares | 상대적 가중치; CPU 경합 시에만 활성화 |\r\r\n| resources.lmits.cpu | 런타임 시 최대 CPU사용량 제한 | cpu.cfs_quota_us | 절대적 시간 할당량; 항상 활성화, 스로틀링 발생 |\r\r\n\r\r\n## Limits 적용으로 발생할 수 있는 현상\r\r\nCPU limits를 설정했을 때 발생하는 가장 중요하고 종종 오해 받는 현상이 바로 CPU 스로틀링입니다. 스로틀링은 단순히 성능을 약간 늦추는 것이 아니라, 애플리케이션의 지연 시간에 심각하고 예측 불가능한 영향을 미칠 수 있는 ‘정지-대기(stop-wait)’ 프로세스입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU 스로틀링과 발생 원인\r\r\nCPU 스로틀링은 컨테이너 내의 프로세스들이 현재의 cfs_period_us(보통 100ms) 동안 할당된 cfs_quota_us를 모두 소진했을 때 발생합니다. 할당량을 모두 사용한 컨테이너의 프로세스들은 커널 스케줄러에 의해 실행이 '정지'됩니다. 그리고 다음 100ms 주기가 시작되어 할당량이 다시 채워질 때까지 대기해야 합니다.\r\r\n이 현상은 특히 멀티 스레드 애플리케이션에서 증폭되어 나타납니다. 예를 들어, 한 컨테이너가 1 코어(cfs_quota_us=100000)의 limit을 가지고 있지만, 4개의 바쁜 스레드를 동시에 실행한다고 가정해 봅시다.\r\r\n이 컨테이너는 4개의 코어를 동시에 사용하여 단 25ms의 실제 시간만에 100ms의 CPU 시간 할당량을 모두 소진할 수 있습니다. 그 후, 해당 컨테이너는 남은 75ms 동안 노드에 유휴 코어가 있더라도 완전히 스로틀링되어 아무 작업도 수행할 수 없게 됩니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit1.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit2.png)\r\r\n스로틀링은 애플리케이션 요청 처리 시간에 직접적으로 지연을 추가합니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 작업을 완료하는 데 순수하게 300ms의 CPU 시간이 필요한 애플리케이션이 100ms 주기당 50ms의 limit에 의해 제한된다고 가정해 봅시다. 이 작업은 다른 시스템 부하가 전혀 없더라도 최소 6개의 주기, 즉 600ms의 실제 시간이 걸려야 완료될 수 있습니다. 이러한 지연은 타임아웃, 연쇄적인 장애, 그리고 궁극적으로는 나쁜 사용자 경험으로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n스로틀링은 전통적인 CPU 사용률 지표로는 확인하기가 힘든 경우가 있습니다. 어떤 컨테이너가 CPU 사용률 50%(자신의 limit 값)를 보이고 있더라도, 실제로는 심각하게 스로틀링되어 매우 느린 상태일 수 있습니다. 이 경우 CPU는 전통적인 의미에서 '최대치로 사용'되는 것이 아니라, 인위적으로 억제되고 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. '시끄러운 이웃' 오해\r\r\nlimits가 ‘시끄러운 이웃(noisy neighbor)’ 문제, 즉 하나의 애플리케이션이 리소스를 독점하여 다른 애플리케이션에 영향을 주는 것을 막아 줄 수 있을 것처럼 보입니다. 하지만 실제로는 requests에 의해 결정되는 cpu.shares가 경합 상황에서도 적절하게 리소스를 배분할 수 있는 시스템이라고 할 수 있습니다. 만약 모든 Pod에 적절한 requests가 설정되어 있다면, CFS 스케줄러는 shares 값에 비례하여 CPU 시간을 분배함으로써 특정 Pod가 다른 Pod들이 기아 상태에 빠지는 것을 방지합니다. 반면 limits는 다른 누구도 CPU를 필요로 하지 않는 상황에서조차 Pod의 사용량을 제한하는 무딘 도구에 가깝습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 스로틀링 테스트\r\r\n테스트를 위해 한 웹 애플리케이션을 만들었습니다. 이 애플리케이션에 1 CPU를 할당하면 작업을 완료하는 데 대략 12초 정도 걸립니다.\r\r\n이 애플리케이션에 각각 1 CPU, 0.1 CPU를 할당하여 CPU 사용량과 작업 시간을 확인하여 지금까지 확인한 현상이 발생하는지 테스트해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 테스트용 Pod 준비\r\r\n아래와 같이 CPU limit만 다르게 설정하여 Pod를 생성하였습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8081\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n---\r\r\n# 1 코어 제한 버전\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8080\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 응답 시간 비교\r\r\n0.1 CPU를 할당한 애플리케이션에서는 122초가 소요된 반면 1 CPU가 할당된 애플리케이션에서는 11.51초만 소요된 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 그라파나를 통한 스로틀링 현상 확인\r\r\n* 초록색: 1 CPU\r\r\n* 노란색: 0.1 CPU\r\r\n\r\r\nCPU 사용률에서 노란색 그래프가 CPU limits가 0.1로 설정되어 그 이상 사용하지 못하는 모습을 보여줍니다. CPU 할당 횟수에서 노란색이 Limits에 걸려서 더 많은 cpu 할당이 발생한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이것은 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가 시뮬레이션과 일치하는 결과입니다. 당연하게도 스로틀링 비율도 노란색이 더 높은 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit4.png)\r\r\n중요한 지표는 스로틀링 비율로서 비율이 5%를 지속적으로 넘는 현상이 발생한다면 스로틀링이 빈번하게 발생하여 성능에 제약을 받아 서비스가 느려져 있을 가능성이 있으므로 조치를 취해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 스로틀링 비율 지표 예시\r\r\n```\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n/\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n## 나가며\r\r\n결론은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n* 일반적인 경우,\r\r\n\t* request만 설정하여 자원이 더 필요할 때는 노드의 가용 자원을 사용하고 자원이 모자랄 때는 비율로 할당 받도록 하는 것이 좋은 것 같습니다. (QoS는 Burstable로 설정됨)\r\r\n\t* QoS가 Burstable로 설정되지만 CPU는 Eviction의 조건이 아니기 때문에 throttling이 발생할지언정 pod가 eviction 되지는 않습니다.\r\r\n* limit만 설정하는 경우는 피해야 합니다. limit만 설정할 경우 request가 0이 되어 자원 가용량이 없는 노드에도 스케줄링 될 수 있으며 런타임 시 예측이 어려워집니다.\r\r\n* CPU request는 Pod가 노드에 할당될 때는 절댓값으로 사용되고 할당된 뒤에는 상대적인 비율로 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n### 참고 문헌\r\r\n• Kubernetes, Resource Management for Pods and Containers, https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/\r\r\n• KubeBlog, Understanding CPU Requests and Limits, 2023. 10. 5., https://www.kubeblog.com/basics/understanding-cpu-requests-and-limits/\r\r\n• Itiel Shwartz, Kubernetes CPU Limits: What’s the Right Way to Assign CPU Resources?, 2025. 1. 14., https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-cpu-limits-throttling/\r\r\n• Eliran Cohen, For the love of god, learn when to use CPU limits on Kubernetes., 2023. 3. 5., https://medium.com/@eliran89c/for-the-love-of-god-learn-when-to-use-cpu-limits-on-kubernetes-2225341e9dbd\r\r\n• Max Levin, Kubernetes CPU Throttling: What it is, and Best Practices, 2024. 6. 6., https://www.groundcover.com/blog/kubernetes-cpu-throttling\r\r\n• CODE FARM, Linux CGroups and Containers, 2024. 2. 3., https://blog.codefarm.me/2021/11/23/linux-cgroups-containers/\r\r\n• Andreas Karis Blog, Quick guide for cgroups, 2020. 9. 3., https://andreaskaris.github.io/blog/linux/cgroups/\r\r\n• Martin, Cgroups - Deep Dive into Resource Management in Kubernetes, 2023. 2. 20., https://martinheinz.dev/blog/91\r\r\n• Jianhao, Kubernetes CPU requests and limits, 2021. 11. 11., https://jaanhio.me/blog/kubernetes-cpu-requests-limits/\r\r\n• Red Hat, Resource Management Guide > CPU, https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-cpu\r\r\n• Real-time Ubuntu, Linux kernel schedulers, https://documentation.ubuntu.com/real-time/latest/explanation/schedulers/\r\r\n• Rifewang, Kubernetes: CPU Configuration, Linux CFS, and Performance Issues with Programming Languages, 2024. 12. 11., https://medium.com/@rifewang/kubernetes-cpu-configuration-linux-cfs-and-performance-issues-with-programming-languages-ccef783ed22e\r\r\n• JettyCloud, Making Sense of Kubernetes CPU Requests And Limits, 2023. 3. 20., https://medium.com/@jettycloud/making-sense-of-kubernetes-cpu-requests-and-limits-390bbb5b7c92\r\r\n• Tania Duggal, PerfectScale, Kubernetes CPU Limit: Best Practices for Optimal Performance, 2024. 10. 24., https://www.perfectscale.io/blog/kubernetes-cpu-limit-best-practises\r\r\n• Shane Corbett, AWS Blogs, Using Prometheus to Avoid Disasters with Kubernetes CPU Limits, 2022. 9. 21., https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-prometheus-to-avoid-disasters-with-kubernetes-cpu-limits/\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_blue_202509.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooterblue202509.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

        "contentSnippet": "오랜만에 인사드립니다. 스포카에서 제품 디자인을 하고 있는 김동환(Donny)입니다.\n이전에 개인 블로그에 바이브 코딩으로 Swift 앱을 제작한 이야기를 공유한 적이 있었는데요, 이번에는 피그마 플러그인을 직접 제작하고, 업무에 적용한 경험을 나눠보고자 합니다.\n매일 2~3시간, 총 3일 정도 걸려 완성했습니다. 사실 이런 단순한 통신과 Mapping을 다루는 플러그인은 이미 흔한 사례지만, 대부분은 TF 단위로 기획되고 만들어집니다.\n그런 점에서 이번 이야기는 PD 혼자서 가볍게 기획하고 제작할 수 있다는 가능성에 더 큰 의미가 있다고 생각합니다.\n프로젝트 커틀러리\n시간적인 이유로 아래와 같은 화면으로 디자인/설계 공유를 하는 분들이 많으실 것 같습니다. 저도 마찬가지였습니다.\n더미 데이터는 공유받는 사람, UT 참여자의 진지한 몰입에 도움이 됩니다. 하지만, 한땀한땀 넣기에는 시간, 체력, 멘탈적인 문제가 있을 수밖에 없습니다.\n특히 B2B SaaS 제품 같은 경우, 테이블이 아주 많습니다. Column이 8개, Row가 30개만 되더라도 도저히 채울 엄두가 나지 않는 것이 사실입니다. 그래서 Mapping 플러그인을 구상하게 되었습니다.\n프로젝트명은 커틀러리(식기)입니다. 손으로 먹지 말고, 도구를 써서 먹자는 바람을 담았습니다.\n어떻게 만들지?\n피그마에서 제공하는 공식 가이드를 참고하면, 생각보다 손쉽게 기본 환경 설정을 마칠 수 있습니다.\n구조를 간단히 살펴보면, 플러그인의 로직을 담당하는 code.ts와 실질적인 화면을 구성하는 ui.html로 이루어져 있습니다.\n팁으로 피그마 플러그인 같이 특수한 룰이 있는 환경에서는 AI 답변의 품질 향상을 위해 별도의 룰 문서나 오답 노트를 .md로 만드시면 좋습니다.\n목표를 명확하게 세워 봅시다. 우선 문자열과 이미지로 구성된 더미 데이터 뭉치가 있어야 하고, 그것들을 피그마 플러그인을 통해 레이어에 주입해야 합니다.\n문자 데이터는 Google Spreadsheets, 이미지는 Google Drive에 넣어 GCP API로 연결하는 것을 머릿속에 그렸습니다.\n주입 방식은 텍스트 레이어 이름과 칼럼명을 대조해 일치한다면, 하위 row 데이터를 랜덤으로 전달하는 방식입니다.\n여기까지만 해도 저는 완벽하다고 생각했습니다. 후후…\n도전 1.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "“한국은 시장이 작다.”\n이 말은 내가 13년 넘게 한국에 투자하면서 셀 수 없을 정도로 너무나 많이 듣던 말이다. 우리 같은 VC에게 자금을 제공하는 한국과 외국 투자자들이 입에 달고 다닐 정도로 너무 많이 하는 지적이고, 심지어 창업가들도 한국 시장이 너무 작기 때문에 항상 해외 시장을 타겟 하거나 아예 본사를 해외로 옮기는 걸 고민하는 경우를 너무 자주 본다. 시장이 작다는 건 다양한 방식으로 해석할 수 있지만, 한국 시장이 작다고 말하는 분들은 대부분 한국의 5,000만 명 인구를 의미한다. 5,000만 인구로 만들 수 있는 GDP와 같은 출력은 한정되어 있기 때문에 한국 시장은 완전히 의미 없을 정도로 작진 않지만, 아무리 커져도 확실히 한계가 있다는 의미이다.\n내가 전에 이 글에서 이제 한국 창업가들이 드디어 글로벌 시장으로 나갈 능력, 배짱, 그리고 자신감이 생겼기 때문에 이제 우리의 TAM(Total Addressable Market)은 한국의 5,000만 명으로 국한되는 게 아니라 일본이나 동남아 시장도 우리의 시장이라고 볼 수 있다고 했다. 이렇게 보면 한국이라는 나라는 인구 5,000만 명의 나라지만, 한국 창업가들의 시장은 이보다 훨씬 더 크다고 할 수 있다.\n물론, 이 외에도 경제 전문가들이 말하는 한국 시장 크기의 한계를 극복하는 두 가지 방법은 북한과의 통일, 그리고 더 많은 외국인을 수입하는 것이다. 현실적으로 북한과의 통일은 단기간 내에 이룩하기 어렵고, 솔직히 요새 많은 분과 이야기해 보면 통일을 오히려 원치 않는다는 느낌을 받기도 한다. 더 많은 외국인을 – 그리고 여기서 말하는 외국인은 외국인 노동자보단, 지식근로자를 의미한다 – 한국으로 수입하기 위해서는 한국의 외국인 비자 정책을 더 쉽고 간단하게 만들어야 한다. 한국의 외국인 비자 프로그램은 생각보다 더 복잡하고 까다로워서 외국인들이 한국에 와서 일하고 사는 게 은근히 어렵다. 그리고 아직도 일부는 한국 젊은이들도 취업을 못 하는데, 외국인들이 한국에 와서 그나마 없는 일자리를 다 “뺐어” 가는 것에 대해서 상당한 불만을 표시하는 분들도 있어서 이 또한 단시간 내에 해결하기 어려운 문제 같다.\n내가 요새 생각하는 한국의 경제 규모와 시장 크기를 확장하는 다른 한 가지 방법은 조금 뜬금없지만, 우리의 가깝고도 먼 이웃 일본과 경제공동체를 만드는 것이다. 그리고 조금 더 나아가선 한국-일본-대만, 이렇게 세 나라가 EU와 같은 경제공동체 AU(Asian Union)를 만드는 것이다. 세 나라는 공통점이 많다. 모두 다 아시아 문화권이고, 모두 다 잘 사는 나라들이고, 모두 다 인구밀도도 비슷해서 이 바닥에서 말하는 ARPU가 높게 나올 수 있다. 그리고 모두 다 서로를 좋아하고 교류가 많다. 이런 말을 전에 공개적으로 했는데, 어떤 분들은 일본과 우리가 경제공동체를 만들어야 한다는 아이디어에 매우 민감하게 반응했다. 대부분 나이가 든 노인들이었는데, 나는 이분들에게 얼마나 많은 한국 젊은이가 일본을 좋아하고, 얼마나 많은 일본 젊은이가 한국을 좋아하는지 강조했다. 솔직히 잘 먹히진 않았지만, 어차피 노인들은 곧 죽을 것이고, 양국의 정치 또한 젊은이들이 할 것이라서 나는 이 아이디어가 그렇게 가능성이 없다고 생각하지 않는다.\n솔직히 대만은 중국이 있어서 좀 어렵긴 할 것 같지만, 이미 월드 클래스인 세 나라가 공동체를 만들 수 있다면, 시장 크기, 인구 크기, 경제 크기, 이 모든 면에서 정말 거대하고 대단한 규모의 시장을 만들 수 있을 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 한 팟캐스트에서 습관에 대해 연구하는 작가의 인터뷰를 들었다. 이분이 최근에 출시한 책은 습관은 무엇이고, 어떻게 하면 큰 목표를 달성하기 위한 습관을 형성할 수 있는지에 대한 내용인데, 이 책을 출간하면서 가장 많이 참고했던 게 군대이고, 가장 많이 인터뷰했던 사람들이 군인이라고 한다. 특히 작가가 했던 말 중 내 기억에 인상 깊게 남았던 말은 “군대는 습관을 인위적으로 형성하는 거대한 기계”였다. 이 말을 하면서 예로 들었던 건, 이제 갓 고등학교를 졸업하고 입대한, 정말로 아무것도 모르는 18살짜리 애도 수색하다가 폭탄이 발견되면 완전히 기계같이 행동한다는 내용이었다.\n위의 예처럼 폭탄이 발견되면 기계같이 행동하는 군인들이 있지만, 또 그렇게 하지 않는 군인도 있는데, 어쨌든 전반적으로 군대 자체가 모두의 습관을 형성하는 거대한 기계의 역할을 하므로, 입대하면 어쩔 수 없이 이런 습관들이 다른 업종 사람들보다 더 잘 형성된다는 내용이었다. 나는 이 팟캐스트를 들으면서, 군대만큼 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계는 바로 스타트업이라는 생각을 했다.\n내가 아는 모든 창업가 중 사업을 오랫동안, 꾸준히 잘하는 분들은 모두 다 습관의 동물들이다. 실은 나도 스트롱벤처스를 만들었으니까 굳이 분류하자면 창업가라고 할 수 있는데, 나에게도 스트롱벤처스는 지난 13년 동안 습관을 – 좋은 습관도 있고 좋지 않은 습관도 있지만, 대부분 너무 좋은 습관 – 형성해 준 작은 기계와도 같다. 아마도 투자자로서의 습관, 그리고 실제로 사업을 운영하는 창업가로서의 습관은 조금 다르겠지만, 내가 창업가들을 관찰하면서 느끼는, 이들이 스타트업을 하기 때문에 형성된 가장 두드러진 습관은 우선순위를 파악하는 인지적 습관이다. 사업을 하다 보면 해야 할 일은 너무 많은데, 그 모든 것을 할 수 있는 시간과 돈은 턱없이 부족하다. 그리고 주위에서 잔소리와 훈계를 얼마나 많이 하는지. 이 모든 것을 무시하면서, 실제로 나에게 도움을 주는 조언과 도움이 전혀 되지 않는 잡음을 구분하고, 우리 회사에 도움이 되는 일에만 우선순위를 매기는 습관은 내가 아는 사람 중 창업가들이 가장 잘 한다.\n스타트업이 창업가들에게 기계적으로 형성시켜 주는 또 다른 습관은 행동하고, 이를 계속 반복하는 행동이다. 내가 자주 사용하는 말 중 하나가 “founders are machines of iteration”인데, 한정된 자원으로 좋은 제품을 만들다 보면, 어쩔 수 없이 이론보단 실제로 뭔가를 만들어 테스팅하고, 답이 없는 문제에 대해 오래 끙끙 고민하기보단 그냥 바로 실행하는 게 창업가들이다. 아주 훌륭한 습관이다.\n그리고 또 다른 습관은 위기에서 빠져나가서 살 수 있는 기회와 패턴을 남들보다 더 잘 볼 수 있는 것도 스타트업이 창업가들에게 단련시키는 습관 중 하나인 것 같다. 위기 앞에서 남들은 감정적으로 휩쓸리면서, 가장 덜 고통스럽게 포기하는 방법을 찾지만, 창업가들은 절대로 포기하지 않고, 이 위기를 극복할 방법을 습관적으로 찾게 되는데, 이건 스타트업이 아니었으면 아마도 형성되기 어려운 습관이지 않을까 생각한다.\n마지막으로, 아무리 좋아도 별로 좋아하지 않고, 아무리 나빠도 별로 낙담하지 않는, 일희일비하지 않는 습관이다. 내가 아는 대부분의 경험 많은 창업가들은 일희일비하지 않는다. 실은, 나도 비슷한 성향이긴 하지만, 그래도 너무 좋을 땐 기뻐하고, 너무 화가 날 땐 슬퍼하는 감정에 빠진다. 하지만, 내가 아는 정말 노련한 창업가들은 “이기면 다음 시합을 준비하고, 져도 다음 시합을 준비한다.”라는 덤덤한 마인드로 사업을 하고 인생을 사는데, 이것 또한 스타트업이라는 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계가 아니면 생길 수 없는 좋은 습관인 것 같다.\n위에서 언급한 습관들은 내가 지난 13년 동안 창업가들과 가깝게 지내면서 항상 감탄하면서 동시에 나도 내 습관으로 만들기 위해서 부단하게 노력하고 있는 그런 좋은 장점들인데, 어떻게 보면 이런 습관은 내가 항상 강조하는 창업가의 바퀴벌레와 같은 특성을 기반으로 형성되기도 하는 것 같다. 원래 바퀴벌레 특성을 가진 사람들이 창업하는 건지, 아니면 창업하게 되면 스타트업이라는 기계가 바퀴벌레의 습관을 형성하는 건진 잘 모르겠지만, 아마 둘 다이지 않을까 싶다.",
