        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2026/01/how-to-avoid-common-pitfalls-with-jpa-and-kotlin/",
        "pubDate": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:25:41 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This post was written together with Thorben Janssen, who has more than 20 years of experience with JPA and Hibernate and is the author of “Hibernate Tips: More than 70 Solutions to Common Hibernate Problems” and the JPA newsletter.\nKotlin and Jakarta Persistence (also known as JPA) are a popular combination for server-side development. Kotlin offers concise syntax and modern language features, while Jakarta Persistence provides a proven persistence framework for enterprise applications.\nHowever, Jakarta Persistence was originally designed for Java. Some of Kotlin’s popular features and concepts, like null safety and data classes, help you tremendously when implementing your business logic, but they don’t align well with the specification.\nThis article outlines a set of best practices to help you avoid problems and build reliable persistence layers with Kotlin and Jakarta Persistence. And to share some good news before diving in, IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1 will automatically detect many of these issues, highlight them with warnings, and provide support through various inspections.\nEntity class design\nJakarta Persistence defines several requirements for entity classes that form the foundation for how persistence providers manage entity objects.\nAn entity class must:\nProvide a no-argument constructor\nThe persistence provider uses reflection to call the no-argument constructor to create entity instances when loading data from the database.\nHave non-final attributes\nWhen fetching an entity object from the database, the persistence provider sets all attribute values after it calls the no-argument constructor to instantiate the entity object. This process is called hydration.\nAfter that is done, the persistence provider keeps a reference to the entity object to perform automatic dirty checks, during which it detects changes and updates the corresponding database records automatically.\nBe non-final\nThe persistence provider often creates proxy subclasses to implement features such as lazy loading for @ManyToOne and @OneToOne relationships. For this to work, the entity class can’t be final.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these specification requirements, it is a widely accepted best practice to:\nImplement equals, hashCode, and toString carefully\nThese methods should rely only on the entity’s identifier and type to avoid unexpected behavior in persistence contexts. You can find approaches for better implementing those here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese rules are easy to follow in Java but conflict with some of Kotlin’s defaults, such as final classes, immutable properties, and constructor-based initialization.\nThe following sections show how to adapt your Kotlin classes to meet these requirements while still using Kotlin’s language features effectively.\nData classes vs. entities\nKotlin’s data classes are designed to hold data. They are final and provide several utility methods, including getters and setters for all fields, as well as equals, hashCode, and toString.\nThis makes data classes a great fit for DTOs, which represent query results and are not managed by your persistence provider.\nBelow is a typical usage of a data class to fetch data:\ndata class EmployeeWithCompany(val employeeName: String, val companyName: String)\n\nval query = entityManager.createQuery(\"\"\"\n   SELECT new com.company.kotlin.model.EmployeeWithCompany(p.name, c.name)\n    FROM Employee e\n       JOIN e.company c\n    WHERE p.id = :id\"\"\")\n\nval employeeWithCompany = query.setParameter(\"id\", 1L).singleResult;\nHowever, entities differ because they are managed objects. And that causes problems when you model them as a data class.\nFor entities, the persistence provider automatically detects changes and uses lazy loading for relationships. To support this, it expects entity classes to follow the requirements defined in the Jakarta Persistence specification, which we discussed at the beginning of this chapter. \nAs you can see in the following table, that makes Kotlin’s data classes a bad fit for entity classes.\n\nKotlin Data ClassJakarta Persistence Entity\nClass TypeFinalMust be open (non-final) so the provider can create proxy subclasses\nConstructorsPrimary constructor with required parametersMust provide a no-argument constructor, used by the persistence provider\nMutabilityImmutable by default (val properties)Must have mutable, non-final attributes so the provider can perform lazy loading as well as detect and persist changes\nequals and hashCodeUse all propertiesShould rely only on type and primary key\ntoStringIncludes all propertiesShould only reference eagerly loaded attributes to avoid additional queries\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended approach is to use regular open classes to model your entities. They are mutable and proxy-friendly, and they don’t cause any issues with Jakarta Persistence.\n@Entity\nopen class Person {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n}\nNon-final classes and no-argument constructors\nAs discussed earlier, Jakarta Persistence requires entity classes to be non-final and provide a no-argument constructor. \nKotlin’s classes are final by default and don’t have to offer a no-argument constructor.\nBut don’t worry, it’s easy to fulfill the requirements without changing your code or implementing your entity classes in a specific way. Just add the no-arg and all-open plugins and add kotlin-reflect to your dependencies. This adds the required constructor and marks annotated classes as open at build time.\nCurrently, you need the compiler plugins plugin.spring and plugin.jpa, which will automatically add the no-arg and all-open plugins. When creating a new Spring project using the New Project wizard in IntelliJ IDEA or via start.spring.io, both plugins are automatically configured for you. And starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1, this will also be the case when you add a Kotlin file to an existing Java project.\nplugins {\n   kotlin(\"plugin.spring\") version \"2.2.20\"\n   kotlin(\"plugin.jpa\") version \"2.2.20\"\n}\n\nallOpen {\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Entity\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.MappedSuperclass\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Embeddable\")\n}\nWhen configuring this manually, pay close attention to both parts of this setup. plugin.jpa appears to provide the required configuration, but it only configures the no-arg plugin, not the all-open one. This will be improved with the upcoming JPA plugin update. You will then no longer have to add the allOpen section. See: KT-79389\nMutability\nAs a Kotlin developer, you’re used to analyzing whether information is mutable or immutable and modelling your classes accordingly. And when defining your entities, you might want to do the same. But that creates potential issues.\nvar vs. val\nIn Kotlin, you use val to define an immutable field or property and var for mutable ones. Under the hood, val is compiled in Java to a final field. But as discussed earlier, the Jakarta Persistence specification requires all fields to be non-final.\nSo, in theory, you can’t use val when modelling your entities. However, if you look at various projects, you can find several entities that use val without causing any bugs.\n@Entity\nclass Person(name: String) {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String = name\n}\nThat’s because your Jakarta Persistence implementation, the persistence provider, populates entity fields through reflection if you use field-based access, which is usually the case when implementing Jakarta Persistence entities in Kotlin. final fields can also be modified using reflection. As a result, your persistence provider can modify val fields, but this contradicts Kotlin’s immutability guarantees.\nSo, practically, you can use val to model immutable fields of your entity class. Still, it’s not in line with the Jakarta Persistence specification, and your fields are not as immutable as you might expect. To make it even worse, JEP 500: Prepare to Make Final Mean Final discusses introducing a warning and future changes to restrict final field modifications via reflection. This would prevent you from using val on your entity fields and break many persistence layers using Jakarta Persistence and Kotlin.\nBe careful when using val for your entity fields and make sure everyone on your team understands the implications.\nStarting with version 2026.1, IntelliJ IDEA will display a weak warning indicating that a val field will be modified when the persistence provider, such as Hibernate or EclipseLink, instantiates the entity object.\nAccess types\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification defines two access types that determine if your persistence provider uses getter and setter methods to access your entity’s fields or reflection.\nYou can define the access type explicitly by annotating your entity class with the @Access annotation. Or, as almost all development teams do, define it implicitly by where you place your mapping annotations:\nAnnotations on entity fields → field access = direct access using reflection\nAnnotations on getter methods → property access = access via getter or setter methods\nMost Kotlin developers put their annotations on properties, which Hibernate treats as field access by default.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nIn this example, it might look like the getter and setter methods will be called to access the name property. But that’s only the case for your business logic. Because we annotated the fields, the persistence provider will use reflection to access them directly, bypassing the getter and setter methods.\nAs a general best practice, it’s recommended to stick to field access. It’s easier to read and lets your persistence provider access the entity’s fields directly. You can then provide getter and setter methods that help your business code without affecting your database mapping.\nIf you want to use property access, you can either annotate your entity class with @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY) or annotate the accessors explicitly:\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nHowever, when you do this, you must ensure that all fields are defined as var. Kotlin doesn’t provide setter methods for fields defined as val.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String? = null \n}\nYou can see this when checking Kotlin’s decompiled bytecode of a snippet above.\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport kotlin.Metadata;\nimport org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;\n\n\n@Entity\n…\npublic final class Company {\n  @Nullable\n  private Long id;\n  @Nullable\n  private final String name;\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  @Nullable\n  public final Long getId() {\n     return this.id;\n  }\n\n  public final void setId(@Nullable Long var1) {\n     this.id = var1;\n  }\n\n  @Nullable\n  public final String getName() {\n     return this.name;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYour persistence provider will check that each field has a getter and a setter method. As long as you use var to define your entity fields, property access works with Kotlin.\nNull safety and default values\nNull safety and default values are two popular features in Kotlin that don’t exist in that form in Java. It’s no surprise that you have to pay special attention if you want to use them in your Jakarta Persistence entities.\nNullability considerations (including primary key fields)\nKotlin allows you to define whether a field or property supports null values. Unfortunately, reflection can bypass Kotlin’s null prevention, and as explained earlier, the persistence provider uses reflection to initialize your entity objects.\nEven if you define an entity attribute as non-nullable, your persistence provider will set it to null if the database contains a null value. In your business code, this can lead to runtime exceptions similar to those seen in Java.\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"user\")\nclass User(\n   @Id\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String\n)\n\nfun testLogic(){\n   // Suppose the row with id = 1 has name = NULL in the database\n   val user = userRepository.findById(1).get()\n   println(\"Firstname: ${user.name}\") // null, because Hibernate saves null via reflection\n}\nAnd unfortunately, solving this problem is not as easy as it seems.\nYou could argue that all non-nullable entity fields should map to a database column with a not-null constraint. So, your database can’t contain any null values.\nIn general, this is a great approach. But it does not eliminate the risk completely. Constraints can get out of sync between different environments or during migrations. Therefore, using not-null constraints on your database is highly recommended, but it doesn’t provide an unbreakable guarantee that you will never fetch a null value from the database.\nTo make it even worse, all Jakarta Persistence implementations call the no-argument constructor of your entity class to instantiate an object and then use reflection to initialize each field. This means that technically, all your entity fields must be nullable.\nWhat does that mean for your entities? Should you use val or var to model your fields?\nThat decision is ultimately up to you. Both of them work, but we recommend sticking to the Kotlin way: Use val if an entity field is not supposed to be changed by your business logic, and var otherwise. However, due to the issues discussed earlier, it is also essential to ensure that everyone on your team is aware that your Jakarta Persistence implementation may set those fields to null if your database lacks a not-null constraint.\n@Id and generated value\nThe previous paragraphs already discussed why all entity fields should be nullable. However, many developers consider primary key attributes to be distinct because the database requires a primary key value, and the Jakarta Persistence specification defines it as immutable. Primary keys are mandatory and immutable as soon as you persist the entity object in your database. But let’s quickly discuss why this doesn’t mean that primary key values should be not-nullable, especially if you’re using database-generated primary key values.\nWhen you want to store a new record in your database, you create a new entity object without a primary key and persist it. \nUnfortunately, the Jakarta Persistence specification doesn’t clearly define how to implement the persist operation. But it requires generating a primary key value if none is provided. The handling of provided primary key values differs across implementations, but that’s a topic for a different article. \nThe important thing here is that all persistence providers treat null as a not-provided primary key value. They then use a database sequence or an auto-incremented column to generate a primary key value and set it on the entity object. Due to this mechanism, the primary key value is null before the entity gets persisted, and changes during the persist operation.\nAn interesting side note is that Hibernate handles the primary key value 0 differently when calling the persist or the merge method. The persist method throws an exception because it expects the object to be an already-persisted entity. In contrast, Hibernate’s merge method generates a new primary key value and inserts a new record into the database. That’s why you can model a primary key with the default value 0 and save the new entity object using Spring Data JPA. The default repository implementation recognizes the already set primary key value and calls the merge method instead of the persist method.\nNow, returning to the initialization of primary key fields.\nWhen you fetch an entity object from the database, your persistence provider uses the parameterless constructor to instantiate a new object. It then uses reflection to set the primary key value before it returns the entity object to your business code.\nAll of this clearly shows that the Jakarta Persistence specification expects the primary key field to be mutable, even though the primary key value is not allowed to change after it was assigned. To avoid any portability issues across different Jakarta Persistence implementations, use null to represent an undefined primary key value.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n}\nDeclaring default values\nKotlin’s support for default values can simplify your business code and prevent null values. \n@Entity\nclass Company(\n   @Id @GeneratedValue \n   var id: Long? = null,\n\n   @NotNull\n   var name: String = \"John Doe\",\n\n   @Email\n   var email: String = \"default@email.com\"\n)\nHowever, please be aware that these default values will have no effect when your persistence provider fetches an entity object from the database.\nval companyFromDb = companyRepository.findById(1).get()\nprintln(companyFromDb.email) // <- If email in DB is empty, it will not set to \"default@email.com\"\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification requires a parameterless constructor that the implementations call when fetching an entity object from the database. After that, they use reflection to map all values retrieved from the database to the corresponding entity fields. As a result, the default values defined in your constructor will not be used, and some fields of your entity object might not be set even though you expect your constructor to assign default values. This may not cause any issues in your application, but it is something you and your team should be aware of.\nAnnotation placement\nIn Java, annotations are typically applied directly to the field, method, or class you annotate. In Kotlin, by contrast, annotations can target different elements, such as constructor parameters, properties, or fields.\nBefore Kotlin 2.2, this often caused problems because annotations applied to properties were applied only to the constructor parameter by default. This often caused problems for Jakarta Persistence and validation frameworks. Annotations like @NotNull, @Email, or even @Id didn’t end up where the framework expected them to be. This led to missed validations or mapping issues.\nThe good news is that this has been improved in Kotlin 2.2. With the new compiler option, which IntelliJ IDEA will suggest enabling, annotations will be applied to the constructor parameter and the property or field by default. So, your code now works as expected without requiring any changes.\nTo learn more, check out the blog post.\nIntelliJ IDEA to the rescue!\nIn the upcoming 2026.1 release, IntelliJ IDEA will provide inspections and quick-fixes to address many of the problems mentioned in this article, thereby improving your overall experience.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2026/01/platform-debugger-architecture-redesign-for-remote-development-in-2026-1/",
        "pubDate": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:15:50 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "The IntelliJ Platform provides a powerful debugger framework that plugins can extend to support various programming languages and runtime environments. To enable remote development scenarios – where the IDE interface runs on your local machine while code executes on a remote server – we’ve redesigned the debugger architecture. This guide walks you through the changes and shows you how to migrate your plugin for 2026.1 and beyond.\nWhy split the debugger?\nIn the last several releases, we re‑architected the IntelliJ Platform debugger to support Remote Development mode. The major change visible to users is that the Debugger tool window and breakpoints are now rendered on the frontend, while the backend hosts the active debugger session and communicates with the target process. As a result, the debugger experience in Remote Development mode is much more responsive and stable. However, these changes have modified the debugger implementation and might affect existing plugins.\nTo provide the same experience in both Remote Development and Local IDE modes, we use a single implementation for both. Therefore, the changes described in this guide can affect plugins in both modes.\nImportant: This guide focuses primarily on plugin support in Local mode. For migration steps for Remote Development mode, see the section below.\nWhat’s changed?\nTo support Remote Development mode, we split the debugger into two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend is responsible for rendering the Debugger tool window (frames, variables’ tree, inlays, etc.). The backend hosts the active debugger session started by a plugin and provides data to the frontend via RPC (Remote Procedure Call).\nAs a result of these changes, several debugger API contracts have changed.\nThe debugger UI is now created asynchronously, so older methods that access the debugger UI or the Debugger tab may cause race conditions.\nThe frontend implementation no longer works directly with entities provided by plugins via XDebugProcess and XSuspendContext. For example, XStackFrame, XValue, and other instances are no longer available on the frontend. Instead, we use FrontendXValue wrappers that cannot be cast to plugin‑specific XValue implementations.\nExample: Suppose you have a plugin that implements a custom debugger. The plugin extends XDebugProcess as MyDebugProcess and provides custom implementations: MyStackFrame (which extends XStackFrame), MyValue (which extends XValue), and other entities. In addition to the backend implementation, the plugin provides an action that assumes the platform debugger UI operates on those entities directly (e.g. XValueNodeImpl contains MyValue).\nNow that the debugger has been split, the platform debugger UI operates with FrontendXValue and other frontend wrappers instead (e.g. XValueNodeImpl now contains FrontendXValue). As a result, actions operating on the debugger UI may unexpectedly access frontend entities and fail to cast them to plugin entities (e.g. FrontendXValue is not an instance of MyValue). See the following sections for more details.\nWhat should I do?\nTest your plugin with the 2026.1 EAP. UI components and actions are the areas most likely to be affected.\nPay attention to error messages in the IDE log. Incorrect debugger API usage will be logged with the [Split debugger] message prefix and an explanation of the migration steps.\nTwo migration paths:\nDepending on your plugin requirements, choose one of the following migration paths:\nLocal mode only – Migrate from the affected APIs below to the recommended ones. Your plugin will work in Local IDE mode, but some functionality may work incorrectly in Remote Development.\nLocal + Remote Development modes – Follow the Remote Development mode migration steps below to support both modes.\nIf you encounter unexpected API behavior, please report it in YouTrack.\nWhich APIs are affected in Local IDE mode?\nThe following APIs related to the debugger UI are deprecated and unsafe to use since 2026.1:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getRunContentDescriptor – deprecated and must not be used, as the frontend UI should not be accessed from the backend. See the Javadoc for more details.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI – deprecated and must not be used. Can lead to race conditions due to asynchronous creation of the frontend UI.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab (internal) – deprecated and must not be used. Can also lead to race conditions.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady.\nWhich APIs are safe to use in Local IDE mode?\nAll APIs that provide data to the backend are valid and safe to use in Local mode, such as XDebugProcess, XSuspendContext, and the data they provide.\nFor creating debugger‑related actions, the following APIs are supported:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.actions.handlers.XDebuggerActionHandler\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XDebuggerTreeActionBase\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XFetchValueActionBase\nThese actions should not require changes in Local IDE mode. They have been adapted to use plugin‑specific entities instead of frontend wrappers to preserve compatibility with the older implementation.\nRemote Development mode migration steps\nThe following APIs will NOT work in Remote Development mode:\nUI and Debugger tab access:\n\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady\nBase action classes that work with debugger nodes:\n\nXDebuggerTreeActionBase\nXFetchValueActionBase\nUse these alternatives instead:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter – use this to provide additional tabs in the Debugger tool window.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady – also works for adding tabs, but com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter is the recommended approach.\nXDebuggerTreeBackendOnlyActionBase – an alternative to XDebuggerTreeActionBase that works only with XValue instead of nodes.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Android Gradle plugin 9.0 is now available, and it includes two major changes that will affect existing Kotlin projects:\nAndroid apps need to start using AGP 9.0’s built-in Kotlin support.\nKotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Android need to migrate to the new Android KMP library plugin.\nThis post provides some details about these changes and points you to the resources that you’ll need to update your existing projects.\nYou’ll also need to update tools and plugins that depend on AGP to their latest versions with support for AGP 9.0. If you use Android Studio, you’ll need to use Otter 3 Feature Drop or later.\nNote: Support for AGP 9.0 is coming soon to IntelliJ IDEA, expected to arrive in Q1 2026.\nFor information about Gradle plugin compatibility, you can refer to this community-maintained page.\nWe are working on adopting AGP 9.0 in our documentation, samples, and wizards. This means that they will all use AGP 9.0 by default and already include these changes in their respective configurations.\nUse built-in Kotlin\nPreviously, Android projects had to apply the Kotlin Android plugin (org.jetbrains.kotlin.android) to add support for Kotlin source files. With AGP 9.0, Kotlin support is built in and enabled by default, so you no longer need to apply the Kotlin Android plugin separately for Android apps.\nThe main migration step here is to remove usages of the Kotlin Android plugin from your projects. However, if your project uses kapt for annotation processing or sets custom kotlinOptions, you’ll need to update those configurations as well.\nRead the migration guide in the Android documentation for step-by-step instructions.\nWith AGP 9.0, you can still opt out of these changes temporarily by adding android.builtInKotlin=false and android.newDsl=false to your gradle.properties. However, this will no longer work in AGP 10.0, which is expected sometime in 2026.\nUse the new Android KMP library plugin\nIn previous versions, the Android Gradle plugin provided two different plugins you could apply to a module:\nThe Android library plugin (com.android.library).\nThe Android application plugin (com.android.application).\nEither of them could be used in combination with the KMP plugin (org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform) to set up a multiplatform module.\nAGP 9.0 introduces a new, simplified Android KMP library plugin (com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library), built specifically for multiplatform projects. The previously used Android library and Android application plugins are no longer compatible with the KMP plugin in the same module, which means you’ll need to migrate any multiplatform modules to the new plugin. This migration will be different for library and application modules; you can learn more about both scenarios below.\nWith AGP 9.0, you can still opt out of these changes temporarily by adding android.enableLegacyVariantApi=true to your gradle.properties. However, this will no longer work in AGP 10.0, which is expected sometime in 2026.\nMigrating a library module\nIf you have a module that uses the Android library plugin and the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin together, you’ll have to replace the Android library plugin with the Android KMP library plugin. This means you’ll have to update the build configuration of your existing module, but generally no changes are required to your project structure or source code.\nThe new Android KMP library plugin has default settings that are designed for Kotlin Multiplatform and optimized for build speed and stability. Some previous configuration options have been removed or moved to new APIs.\nRead the migration guide to learn about the differences and get step-by-step instructions on how to migrate a library module to the new plugin.\nMigrate a library module\n                                                    \nMigrating an application module\nMany projects apply both the Android application plugin and the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin in the same module. A module like this contains shared multiplatform code as well as an Android application with all of its related build configuration. This was the recommended structure in the past, and if you created your project using the KMP wizard, your project probably has a single composeApp module that’s set up like this.\nThe starting setup\nModules like this also have to be migrated to use the new Android KMP library plugin in the module that contains shared code, which requires multiple steps.\nFirst, you’ll have to create a new module for the entry point of your app and apply the Android application plugin there. This new module can be relatively small and simple, containing the build configuration to package an Android app and its entry point, such as Activity and Application classes (all represented by MainActivity in the illustrations here).\nWhen using AGP 9.0, this new module doesn’t need to apply a Kotlin plugin, as it can use the built-in Kotlin support (as detailed above).\nThen, this new application module should depend on the existing multiplatform module to have access to its contents. The multiplatform module can now become an Android library, which means you should migrate it to the new Android KMP library plugin.\nThe migrated project\nTo migrate an Android application module to AGP 9.0, follow the detailed steps in the migration guide.\nMigrate an application module\n                                                    \nConclusion\nWe recommend making these configuration changes in your existing projects as soon as possible to ensure smooth upgrades to the latest versions of AGP in the future.\nIn addition to the links above, you can read the full release notes for AGP 9.0 to learn more about what’s new.\nIf you encounter any issues with AGP 9.0 itself, create a new issue in the Android Studio component of the Google issue tracker.\nFor problems related to the Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin, create an issue in the KMT tracker.\nTo provide feedback on Kotlin documentation, create an issue on YouTrack or report it in the #multiplatform channel on the Kotlinlang Slack.",

AI is already a daily tool for 85% of developers, and 68% expect AI proficiency to become a non-negotiable part of job descriptions within the next few years (according to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025).\nAt JetBrains, we leverage it every day. AI is changing how we write, review, and ship code. We build AI-powered products like AI Assistant and Junie, train models like Mellum, and create frameworks like Koog so others can build their own AI agents.\nWhile everyone’s talking about AI, the conversations vary wildly, from doomsday scenarios to starry-eyed optimism, and everything in between. TransformConf is our attempt to create space for practical discussions. We want you to bring home more than cool merch – we want you to leave with insights you can immediately apply to your work.\nSince 2017, we’ve organized KotlinConf, the biggest yearly Kotlin event and a true celebration of the community. We know how impactful offline events can be. Our hope is that TransformConf becomes the place to discuss AI in software development in a way that impacts both today and tomorrow, a community where you feel at home, and a source of development and inspiration.\nKey details\nThe first TransformConf will take place September 15–16, 2026, at Tobacco Dock in London, UK.\nWho is it for?\nAnyone who is building AI, using AI tools, integrating AI into their products, platforms, and workflows, or preparing to do so. Developers are always at the heart of everything we do, so expect an engineering focus, but we also want to see ML researchers and engineers, DevOps specialists, technical leaders, architects, developer experience and productivity engineers, and anyone on product teams working with AI in production.\nWhat to expect?\nTwo days in London, packed with educational talks, peer discussions, booth meetings, professional reflection, and some fun activities. We’re planning 45-minute and 15-minute talks across three parallel tracks. The program will cover these practical and forward-looking topics:\nBuilding, deploying, and maintaining AI systems end to end\nAligning AI development across disciplines\nAdvanced modeling and training techniques\nDeveloper education and techniques in an AI-driven landscape\nLong-term changes to programming, teams, and the software industry\nSeparating myths from reality, addressing ethics, compliance, and long-term impact\nRethinking developer productivity and human-AI collaboration\nHow do I stay in touch?\nIf TransformConf is something you’re interested in, subscribe to our newsletter for updates on speakers, the program, tickets, and more. \nWhat about speaking and partnership opportunities?\nThe call for speakers is open!

        "pubDate": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:08:14 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hello everyone,\nAs I write these words, the Scala compiler team is wrapping up the Scala 3.8 release. It’s the last major release before a feature freeze. The next one, 3.9, will be the new Long-Term Support version. The compiler team decided that most of the work between 3.8 and 3.9 will go into stabilization, while new features and other improvements will be released with Scala 3.8. By providing support for the new Scala 3.8 features now, we’re able to give you the opportunity to enjoy and test them immediately. This will give both our team and the compiler team the opportunity to collect more and better feedback from you.\n\n\n\n\nThe into modifier\nThere’s a new modifier in Scala syntax, into, that can be used in two ways: as a wrapper over a type or as a soft keyword in front of classes, traits, opaque type aliases, and enum types. By wrapping a type with into[T] – for example, a type of a function parameter – we indicate that any type implicitly convertible to the declared type inside the into wrapper is accepted without requiring the implicitConversions import. The Scala plugin understands this mechanism, correctly infers types, and highlights cases where the conversion isn’t possible. In the future, using an implicit conversion without the implicitConversions import will be treated as an error.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that into is used as a type wrapper for elems, but at the same time we can still use elems.iterator as if elems was of the underlying type IterableOnce[A].\nAlternatively, if the type is in your codebase, you can also add the into modifier to indicate that implicit conversions into that type should always be allowed.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the warning displayed in the video appears only if Compiler-Based Highlighting is enabled.\nYou can read more about the into modifier in the Scala 3 documentation.\n\n\n\n\nScala 3.8 requires JDK 17+\nIn the new Scala release, the minimum required JDK version has been updated to 17. The latest version of the Scala plugin supports this requirement in two ways:\nIn the New Project Wizard: If you select Scala 3.8+ or newer, but choose a JDK version older than 17, a warning popup that reads “JDK >= 17 is required with Scala 3.8” will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn existing projects: If your Scala project or any of its modules requires Scala 3.8+ but is being compiled on a JDK version lower than 17, IntelliJ IDEA will display a special warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Better fors”\n“Better fors” might sound a bit awkward for a feature name, but it introduces a significant and long-anticipated syntax relaxation for Scala’s for-comprehensions. Previously, a for-comprehension had to start with a generator, such as number <- List(1, 2, 3). If you wanted to use an alias, like list = List(1, 2, 3), you had to place it after a generator or define it before the entire for-comprehension and save the result as a value. Now, Scala 3.8 and the Scala plugin support having just the alias before a generator and transforming it into a value automatically. \n\n\n\n\n\nBasic support for capture checking\nThe Scala standard library is now compiled and published using Scala 3. You can see it in the Project view of a Scala 3.8 project. Simply scroll down and unfold the following path: External Libraries | sbt:org.scala-lang.scala-library-3.8.0:jar | scala-lang.scala-library-3.8.0:jar. There, you can find and open standard library source files, for example IterableOnce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the screenshots, the code in the Scala 3.8 version of this class already uses one of the new features: capture checking. Currently, the Scala plugin only supports basic syntax for capture checking, and even this support is experimental. Our goal was to enable you to navigate the Scala standard library code without encountering error highlighting, view type information for captures, and jump to their declarations.\n\n\n\n\nThe runtimeChecked method\nThe runtimeChecked method is an extension method defined in scala.Predef that can be called on any expression. When an expression ends with .runtimeChecked, it is exempt from certain static checks in the compiler, such as pattern match exhaustivity. The Scala plugin supports this feature out of the box. For example, if you write a pattern match that misses some cases – as in the screenshot below that defines all days of the week, but then uses only five of them in a match case – the Scala plugin displays a warning that the pattern matching is not exhaustive. If you decorate the value used for pattern matching with .runtimeChecked, the warning will not be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nThe features highlighted in this article are where the Scala plugin’s support is most visible to users. However, there are numerous other changes we’ve made in preparation for the Scala 3.8 release. In the near future, we will continue to improve our Scala 3 support, including some of the new Scala 3.8 features. Expect more updates in the form of blog posts, release notes, and videos.\nThe features highlighted in this article are where the Scala plugin’s support is most visible to users.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "JPA를 사용하다 보면 대량의 데이터를 삽입해야 하는 상황에서 saveAll의 성능 한계에 부딪히게 됩니다. 이번 포스팅에서는 JPA saveAll의 성능 이슈를 살펴보고, QueryDSL의 SQLQueryFactory를 활용한 Batch Insert로 성능을 획기적으로 개선하는 방법을 소개합니다.\n개요#\n대량의 데이터를 데이터베이스에 저장해야 할 때, 일반적으로 JPA의 saveAll 메서드를 사용합니다. 하지만 데이터의 양이 늘어날수록 saveAll의 처리 속도는 급격히 느려질 수 있습니다. 특히 ID 생성 전략이 IDENTITY인 경우, JPA는 Batch Insert를 지원하지 않아 단건으로 Insert 쿼리가 실행되는 문제가 있습니다.\n이전 포스팅(Spring Batch에서 Exposed를 이용한 Batch Insert)에서 Exposed를 활용한 성능 개선 방법을 소개한 적이 있습니다. 하지만 오직 Batch Insert만을 위해 JPA 환경에 Exposed라는 새로운 ORM을 도입하고 혼합해서 사용하는 것은 설정의 복잡함이나 학습 곡선 측면에서 비효율적일 수 있습니다.\n만약 이미 프로젝트에서 JPA와 QueryDSL을 사용하고 있다면, 추가적인 ORM 도입 없이 QueryDSL-SQL 모듈을 활용하여 Type-Safe하게 Batch Insert를 구현할 수 있습니다. 이번 포스팅에서는 그 방법을 소개합니다.\nJPA saveAll의 성능 이슈#\nJPA(Hibernate)는 엔티티의 ID 생성 전략이 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)로 설정되어 있을 때, JDBC 레벨의 Batch Insert를 비활성화합니다. 이는 영속성 컨텍스트가 엔티티를 관리하기 위해 Insert 즉시 ID 값을 알아야 하기 때문입니다. 결과적으로 1,000개의 데이터를 저장하면 1,000번의 Insert 쿼리가 데이터베이스로 전송되어 성능 저하의 주원인이 됩니다.\n일반적인 JPA의 saveAll 사용 코드는 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n@Transactional\nfun saveAllWriters(writers: List<Writer>) {\n    writerRepository.saveAll(writers)\n}\n\n\n위 코드는 사용하기 매우 편리하지만, 대량의 데이터를 처리할 때는 각 엔티티마다 개별적인 Insert 쿼리가 발생하여 네트워크 오버헤드와 데이터베이스 처리 비용이 증가하게 됩니다.\nQueryDSL Batch Insert 구현#\nQueryDSL-SQL 모듈을 사용하면 JPA 엔티티가 아닌 JDBC 레벨에서 직접 SQL을 구성하여 실행할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 addBatch 기능을 활용한 Bulk Insert를 구현할 수 있습니다.\n의존성 설정#\nQueryDSL-SQL을 사용하기 위해 build.gradle.kts에 아래 의존성을 추가합니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\ndependencies {\n    // QueryDSL JPA (기본 사용)\n    implementation(\"com.querydsl:querydsl-jpa:5.1.0:jakarta\")\n\n    // QueryDSL SQL (Batch Insert를 위해 필요)\n    implementation(\"com.querydsl:querydsl-sql:5.1.0\")\n}\n\n\nQueryDSL-SQL 소개:\nQueryDSL-SQL은 JPA 엔티티 모델이 아닌 데이터베이스 스키마를 기반으로 쿼리를 작성할 수 있게 해주는 모듈입니다. JPA가 제공하지 않는 세밀한 SQL 제어(예: Batch Insert, 특정 벤더 전용 구문 등)가 필요할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있습니다. SQLQueryFactory를 통해 JDBC 레벨의 기능을 Type-Safe하게 사용할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.\n구현 코드 예시#\nSQLQueryFactory를 사용하여 Batch Insert를 구현하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n@Service\nclass BatchInsertService(\n    private val dataSource: DataSource\n) {\n    @Transactional\n    fun executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(writers: List<Writer>): Long {\n        // 1. 테이블 메타데이터 정의\n        val writerTable = RelationalPathBase(Writer::class.java, \"writer\", null, \"writer\")\n        // 2. SQLQueryFactory 생성 (MySQL 템플릿 사용)\n        val sqlQueryFactory = SQLQueryFactory(Configuration(MySQLTemplates()), dataSource)\n        val insert = sqlQueryFactory.insert(writerTable)\n        // 3. 데이터를 Batch에 추가\n        for (writer in writers) {\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.name, writer.name)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.email, writer.email)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.score, 1)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.reputation, 1.toDouble())\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.active, true)\n            insert.addBatch() // 메모리에 쿼리 적재\n        }\n\n        // 4. 일괄 실행\n        return insert.execute()\n    }\n}\n\n\n코드 설명\n\nRelationalPathBase: SQL 쿼리 작성을 위해 대상 테이블의 메타데이터를 정의합니다.\naddBatch(): 루프를 돌며 데이터를 즉시 Insert 하지 않고, JDBC의 Batch 기능을 활용하기 위해 메모리에 쿼리 파라미터들을 쌓아둡니다.\nexecute(): 쌓여있는 Batch 쿼리를 데이터베이스로 한 번에 전송하여 실행합니다.\n\nMySQL 최적화 옵션: rewriteBatchedStatements#\nMySQL을 사용하는 경우, JDBC 연결 URL에 rewriteBatchedStatements=true 옵션을 반드시 추가해야 합니다.\n\n\n1\n\njdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb?rewriteBatchedStatements=true\n\n\n이 옵션이 필요한 이유:\n기본적으로 MySQL JDBC 드라이버는 addBatch()로 들어온 쿼리들을 개별적인 Insert 구문으로 전송합니다. 하지만 이 옵션을 활성화하면 드라이버 레벨에서 여러 개의 Insert 구문을 하나의 INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...), (...), (...) 형태의 Multi-Value Insert 구문으로 재작성(Rewrite)하여 전송합니다. 이를 통해 네트워크 패킷 수를 획기적으로 줄이고 데이터베이스의 파싱 비용을 절감하여 성능을 극대화할 수 있습니다.\n성능 비교#\n성능 측정 코드#\n정확한 성능 측정을 위해 saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch의 실행 시간을 각각 측정했습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n\n    @Test\nfun `saveAll test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            writerRepository.saveAll(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 saveAll 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n@Test\nfun `executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            batchInsertService.executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 QueryDSL Batch Insert 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n\n측정 방식 설명\n\n반복 측정: 각 데이터 구간(100건 ~ 10,000건)마다 총 5회 반복하여 측정했습니다.\nWarm-up 고려: 테스트 실행 시 첫 번째 회차는 결과에서 제외했습니다. 이는 데이터베이스 커넥션 풀(Connection Pool)에서 커넥션을 처음 생성하는 초기 비용 등 초기화 작업에 소요되는 시간이 포함되어 결과가 왜곡되는 것을 방지하기 위함입니다.\n평균값 산출: 첫 회차를 제외한 나머지 4회의 실행 시간을 합산하여 평균값을 산출함으로써 보다 신뢰성 있는 성능 데이터를 얻었습니다.\n\n성능 측정 결과#\n\nJPA saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch를 사용했을 때의 성능 차이를 비교한 결과입니다. 데이터 개수가 늘어날수록 성능 차이가 확연하게 벌어지는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\nrowssaveAll (ms)add batch (ms)성능 개선율\n\n1001041288.50%\n200174.51690.80%\n500370.2527.592.60%\n1,0006955691.90%\n2,0001,5746895.70%\n5,0003,77814096.30%\n10,0007,50526596.50%\n\n\nsaveAll: JPA Repository의 saveAll 메서드 사용\nadd batch: QueryDSL SQLQueryFactory의 addBatch 사용\n\n10,000건 기준으로 약 96.5%의 성능 개선 효과가 있었습니다. saveAll이 약 7.5초 걸리는 작업을 Batch Insert로는 0.26초 만에 처리할 수 있습니다.\n결론#\n대량의 데이터를 처리해야 하는 배치성 작업이나 초기 데이터 적재 시에는 JPA의 saveAll보다는 JDBC Batch Insert를 사용하는 것이 필수적입니다.\n특히, 오직 Batch Insert 성능 개선만을 위해 Exposed와 같은 새로운 ORM을 도입하는 것은 프로젝트의 복잡도를 높일 수 있습니다. 이미 JPA와 QueryDSL을 사용 중인 환경이라면, QueryDSL-SQL을 활용하는 것이 추가적인 학습 곡선이나 설정의 번거로움 없이 Type-Safe하게 성능을 극대화할 수 있는 가장 효율적인 대안입니다.\n프로젝트에서 대량 Insert가 필요한 구간이 있다면, 별도의 라이브러리 추가 없이 QueryDSL-SQL을 통해 성능과 생산성을 동시에 챙겨보시기를 권장합니다.",

AI가 저의 취향에 딱 맞는 콘텐츠만 쏙쏙 골라주니, 시간을 절약할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 매번 만족스러운 시청 경험을 할 수 있게 되는 거죠. 서비스 제공자 입장에서는 사용자가 플랫폼에 더 오래 머물고, 재결제할 확률이 높아지니 서로 윈-윈이 되는 효과라고 볼 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  AI, 생각보다 훨씬 더 우리의 삶에 스며들었네요\n스마트 비서, 챗봇, 스트리밍 추천 외에도 AI는 정말 다양한 방식으로 우리의 삶을 풍요롭게 하고 있습니다. 스마트폰 카메라의 얼굴 인식 기능, 은행 앱의 이상 금융 거래 감지, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 맞춤형 상품 추천, 심지어는 차량 내비게이션의 실시간 교통 분석까지, 우리가 인지하지 못하는 사이에도 AI는 조용히, 그러나 강력하게 작동하고 있어요.\n물론, AI 기술의 발전이 항상 장밋빛 미래만을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다. 개인 정보 보호나 데이터 오남용, 딥페이크와 같은 윤리적인 문제들은 우리가 계속해서 논의하고 해결해나가야 할 숙제임은 분명해요. 하지만 이러한 우려에도 불구하고, AI가 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 긍정적인 측면이 훨씬 더 많다는 것을 부정하기는 어렵습니다.\n솔직히 처음에는 저도 AI가 너무 어렵고, '거대한 기술'이라고만 생각했어요. 하지만 이렇게 매일매일 사용하는 기술들을 되짚어보니, AI는 우리의 삶을 '더 쉽게' 만들어주는 '친근한 도구'라는 사실을 깨달았습니다. 미래의 AI는 또 어떤 모습으로 우리를 놀라게 할지, 정말 기대되지 않나요?\n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI는 스마트 비서처럼 이미 우리 일상에 깊이 스며들어 있습니다.\n✅ 챗봇은 정보 탐색을 넘어 창의적인 아이디어와 시각적 자료까지 제공합니다.\n✅ 스트리밍 서비스 추천은 AI가 우리의 취향을 섬세하게 분석한 결과입니다.\n✅ AI는 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 '친근한 도구'입니다.\nAI는 우리의 생각보다 훨씬 가까이에 있습니다. 조금만 관심을 가지면 AI의 놀라운 잠재력을 더욱 효과적으로 활용할 수 있을 거예요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\nA1: 네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\nQ2: AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\nA2: 개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\nQ3: 미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\nA3: 2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "contentSnippet": "여러분은 브레인스토밍을 할 때 막막함을 느끼시나요? 방대한 아이디어가 필요한데 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 모르겠다고요? 2026년, 이제 ChatGPT는 단순한 정보 제공자를 넘어 여러분의 '생각의 수준'을 한 차원 높여줄 유능한 브레인스토밍 파트너가 될 수 있습니다. 오늘은 제가 직접 사용하며 효과를 본, 창의적인 사고를 돕는 8가지 ChatGPT 프롬프트를 공개합니다. 평범한 아이디어를 벗어나 실용적이고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 얻고 싶은 분들을 위해 준비했어요.\n\n\n솔직히 말하면, 우리는 ChatGPT를 너무 쉽게 생각하는 경향이 있는 것 같아요. 그냥 질문을 던지면 답을 뱉어내는 '아이디어 자판기'처럼 말이죠. 하지만 제가 직접 겪어보니, 제대로 활용하면 정말 놀라운 '브레인스토밍 파트너'가 될 수 있다는 걸 깨달았습니다. 우리가 머리를 쥐어짜며 생각의 흐름을 만들 때, ChatGPT는 그 아이디어의 볼륨과 구조를 잡아주는 역할을 톡톡히 해내죠. 제가 오랫동안 마케팅과 웹 개발 분야에서 일하며 숱하게 브레인스토밍을 해왔는데, 최근 챗GPT와 함께하면서 아이디어의 명확성과 범위가 확연히 넓어지는 것을 경험하고 있습니다. 수많은 선배들의 지혜와 레딧 같은 커뮤니티에서 얻은 영감을 바탕으로, 퍼져 있던 생각들을 실행 가능한 아이디어로 다듬는 데 최적화된 프롬프트 8가지를 소개할게요. 저의 뉴스레터를 장기적으로 흥미롭게 유지하는 방법이라는 주제로 같이 고민해보면 더 와닿으실 거예요.\n1. 맥락을 이해시키는 것부터 시작하세요: 일반적인 아이디어를 피하는 첫걸음\n아무리 인공지능이라도 우리 마음을 꿰뚫어 볼 수는 없잖아요? 그래서 저는 항상 브레인스토밍 세션을 시작하기 전에 ChatGPT에게 명확한 지침을 줍니다. 마치 유능한 팀원에게 프로젝트 브리핑을 하듯이요. 이 '핵심 프롬프트'는 전체 대화의 틀을 잡고, 챗GPT가 뻔하거나 피상적인 아이디어를 내놓는 걸 미리 방지해 주는 역할을 해요. 복잡한 콘텐츠 기획이나 개인적인 목표 설정 같은 작업에 특히 유용하더라고요. 처음부터 이렇게 세부적으로 조율해두면 나중에 불필요한 노력을 훨씬 줄일 수 있습니다. 핵심은 맥락, 명확성, 그리고 의도라는 점, 잊지 마세요!\n  프롬프트 활용 팁:\nGoal(목표): 최종적으로 무엇을 얻고 싶은지 명확히 하세요.\nContext(맥락): 대상, 제약 조건, 시간, 자원 등 배경 정보를 상세히 설명하세요.\nProcess(과정): 어떤 방식으로 진행할지 (예: 질문 개수, 프레임워크 제안 등) 구체적으로 알려주세요.\n당신은 저의 구조화된 브레인스토밍 파트너입니다.\n목표: [주제/문제/결과물 설명]에 대해 브레인스토밍하는 것을 도와주세요.\n맥락: [대상, 제약 조건, 기한, 자원].\n과정: 최대 5개의 명확화 질문을 하나씩 해주세요.\n사용할 수 있는 3-5가지의 다른 브레인스토밍 프레임워크를 제안해주세요 (예: SCAMPER, 마인드맵, 가정, 제약, 첫 번째 원칙).\n제가 하나를 선택하면, 간결하고 번호가 매겨진 목록으로 브레인스토밍을 안내해주세요. 이때 구체성과 실용성을 목표로 합니다.\n궁극적으로, 최고의 아이디어를 3-5가지 테마로 분류하고 구체적인 다음 단계를 제안해주세요.\n간결한 글머리 기호를 사용하고 일반적인 조언은 피해주세요.\n        \n2. 다양한 아이디어로 물꼬를 트세요: 양으로 승부하는 발산적 사고\n아이디어가 막힐 때 가장 빠르고 확실한 방법은 일단 많은 아이디어를 쏟아내는 것이라고 생각해요. 심지어 좀 터무니없는 아이디어라도 괜찮아요! 초기 단계에서는 아이디어의 질보다는 속도와 범위가 훨씬 중요합니다. 이 프롬프트는 ChatGPT와 우리 뇌의 시동을 거는 역할을 해요. 나중에 걸러내고 우선순위를 정하는 건 그때 가서 해도 늦지 않습니다.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시:\n뉴스레터의 메인 콘텐츠를 짧은 숏폼 비디오로 전환 (요즘 대세죠!)\n구독자들이 직접 참여하는 '익명 고민 상담소' 코너 운영\n매주 다른 분야의 전문가를 초대해 인터뷰 시리즈 진행\n프롬프트의 마지막 단계가 정말 중요해요. '가장 유망한 아이디어 5가지 표시'가 없다면, 그냥 방치되는 목록으로 끝나버릴 수도 있거든요. 번호가 매겨진 목록은 나중에 특정 아이디어를 참조할 때도 편리하고요. 개인적인 경험으로는, 종종 목록의 뒷부분에 숨어있는 기발한 아이디어들이 많았습니다. ChatGPT와 마인드맵 도구를 함께 사용하면 아이디어 간의 연관성을 찾는 데 큰 도움이 될 거예요.\n\n\n\n[주제]에 대해 발산적 브레인스토밍을 해봅시다.\n제약 조건: [예산/시간/산업/대상/기타].\n1단계: 명확한 것부터 파격적인 것까지 20가지의 빠르고 대략적인 아이디어를 번호가 매겨진 목록으로 생성해주세요.\n2단계: 각 아이디어에 대해 왜 효과적일 수 있는지에 대한 짧은 문구를 추가해주세요.\n3단계: 영향력 대비 노력 측면에서 가장 유망해 보이는 5가지 아이디어를 표시해주세요.\n        \n3. 역 브레인스토밍으로 숨겨진 문제점 찾기: 실패를 통해 성공 배우기\n생각해보니, 성공하는 방법만 고민할 필요는 없더라고요. 역 브레인스토밍(Reverse Brainstorming)은 문제를 뒤집어서 '어떻게 하면 실패할 수 있을까?'를 묻는 기법입니다. 마치 일이 터지기 전에 미리 사후 검토(Pre-mortem)를 하는 것과 비슷하죠. 저는 이 프롬프트를 통해 어떤 아이디어가 '괜찮긴 한데 뭔가 부족하다'고 느껴질 때 그 이유를 파악하는 데 활용합니다.\n⚠️ 뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (역발상):\n문제: 뉴스레터 이탈률을 높이는 방법은?\n해결책: 과도한 광고 삽입 (뒤집으면: 광고를 최소화하고 콘텐츠 집중)\n해결책: 매주 비슷한 내용만 반복 (뒤집으면: 다양한 형식과 주제로 신선함 유지)\n해결책: 발행 주기를 불규칙하게 (뒤집으면: 일관된 발행 주기 유지)\n이 프롬프트는 약한 아이디어와 흔한 실수를 빠르게 파악하게 해줘요. 만약 아이디어가 너무 일반적이라 실패한다면, 더 틈새시장을 노리는 것이 해결책이 될 수 있고, 너무 복잡해서 실패한다면 간단하게 만드는 것이 답이 될 수 있죠. 정말 유용한 전략입니다!\n[주제]에 대해 역 브레인스토밍을 사용하세요.\n이 문제를 악화시킬 수 있는 15가지 방법을 나열하세요.\n각각의 \"악화\" 아이디어를 건설적인 아이디어 또는 보호 장치로 전환하세요.\n전환된 목록을 구체적이고 테스트 가능한 행동 또는 개념으로 제시하세요.\n        \n4. 무작위 단어로 상상력 점프하기: 기발한 연결고리 만들기\n모든 아이디어가 비슷하게 들리기 시작할 때, 저는 가끔 '무작위성'의 도움을 받아요. 예전에는 사전을 펼치거나 신문을 보면서 뜬금없는 단어에서 영감을 얻기도 했죠. 이 프롬프트는 전혀 관련 없어 보이는 입력값들을 한데 모아 새로운 연결고리를 찾도록 강제합니다. 아, 그런데 이거 뇌세포에 정말 무리가 갈 때도 있어요... 그래서 챗GPT가 이렇게 도움이 될 줄은 몰랐네요!\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (무작위 단어: '나무'):\n은유: 나무의 나이테처럼 구독자들의 성장 과정을 담는 콘텐츠 시리즈 기획\n제약: '나무'라는 단어의 의미를 벗어나지 않게 친환경, 지속 가능성 테마의 콘텐츠만 다루기\n관점: 뉴스레터를 '지식의 숲'으로 비유하여 구독자들이 각자 나무를 심고 가꾸는 커뮤니티 조성\n사실 무작위 단어 그 자체는 중요하지 않아요. 중요한 건 그 단어들을 은유, 제약, 또는 평소에는 고려하지 않았을 관점으로 번역하는 과정에서 가치가 생긴다는 점입니다. 정말 신기하죠?!\n[주제]에 대한 창의적이고 명확하지 않은 아이디어를 원합니다.\n1단계: 무작위의 관련 없는 트리거 단어 5개를 생성하세요.\n2단계: 각 단어에 대해 아이디어를 영감을 주거나 수정할 수 있는 세 가지 방법을 보여주세요.\n3단계: 도출된 가장 흥미로운 방향 5가지를 요약하세요.\n        \n5. SCAMPER 프레임워크로 체계적인 사고 확장하기\n에드워드 드 보노(Edward de Bono)가 측면 사고(Lateral Thinking)를 대중화시켰죠. SCAMPER는 측면 사고를 위한 고전적인 창의성 프레임워크인데, AI와 함께 사용하면 정말 눈부시게 빠릅니다! 이 프레임워크는 특정 아이디어를 다양한 각도에서 질문하고 변형하며 새로운 가능성을 탐색하도록 돕습니다.\n요소\n의미\n뉴스레터 아이디어 예시\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute\n대체하기\n텍스트 콘텐츠를 짧은 오디오 클립으로 대체\n\n\nCombine\n결합하기\n주간 칼럼과 독자 Q&A 코너를 결합하여 '전문가에게 묻다' 시리즈\n\n\nAdapt\n적응하기\n타 산업의 성공적인 콘텐츠 전략을 뉴스레터에 적용\n\n\nModify\n수정/확대/축소\n메인 칼럼의 길이를 확 줄이고 대신 인포그래픽으로 시각화\n\n\nPut to other uses\n다른 용도로 활용\n뉴스레터 콘텐츠를 활용해 소셜 미디어 카드뉴스 제작\n\n\nEliminate\n제거하기\n모든 광고 제거, 오직 순수 콘텐츠에만 집중\n\n\nReverse\n뒤집기/재배열\n결론을 먼저 보여주고 그 이유를 설명하는 콘텐츠 구성\n\n\n\n\n\n이 프롬프트는 이미 어느 정도 구체화된 아이디어에 적용할 때 빛을 발합니다. 그래서 저는 브레인스토밍 과정의 후반부에 이 프롬프트를 사용하는 편이에요. 특정 기능을 제거하거나 두 가지 요소를 결합하는 것 같은 작은 변화가 아이디어의 명확성이나 유용성을 극적으로 향상시키는 것을 자주 경험할 수 있을 겁니다.\nSCAMPER 프레임워크를 사용하여 [제품/프로젝트/주제]에 대해 브레인스토밍하세요.\n각 요소(Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse)에 대해:\n일반적인 조언이 아닌 3-5가지 구체적인 아이디어를 생성하세요.\n각 아이디어를 한 문장으로 유지하세요.\n모든 SCAMPER 단계에서 가장 좋은 아이디어 5가지의 짧은 목록으로 마무리하세요.\n        \n6. SWOT 분석으로 아이디어를 현실에 대입하기: 전략적 점검\n아이디어가 아무리 좋아 보여도 현실성이 없으면 무용지물이잖아요? SWOT 분석 스타일의 프롬프트는 브레인스토밍을 현실 세계로 끌어와 앞으로 발생할 수 있는 상충 관계(Trade-offs)를 미리 보여줍니다. 저는 종종 이 프롬프트를 통해 '보기에는 좋은 아이디어'가 실질적으로 어떤 문제점을 안고 있는지 파악하고 싶을 때 사용하곤 해요.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (SWOT):\n강점 활용: '전문가 인터뷰' 강점을 살려 해당 분야 최고 권위자를 초빙하는 특별 시리즈 기획\n약점 보완: '콘텐츠 제작 시간 부족' 약점을 해결하기 위해 구독자 참여형 콘텐츠 비중 확대\n기회 포착: '트렌드 변화' 기회를 활용해 AI 기술 트렌드를 빠르게 분석하는 섹션 신설\n위협 방어: '경쟁사 증가' 위협에 대비해 뉴스레터만의 독점적인 커뮤니티 기능 강화\n이 분석을 통해 얻은 통찰력은 아이디어의 질을 높이고 실행력을 개선하는 데 결정적인 역할을 합니다. 시각적인 다이어그램 도구를 함께 사용하면 아이디어를 한눈에 파악하는 데 더욱 효과적일 거예요. 솔직히 말해서, 이 과정 없이는 뭔가 중요한 걸 놓치고 있는 느낌이 들 때가 많아요.\n[아이디어 또는 프로젝트]에 대해 SWOT 방식의 브레인스토밍 세션을 실행하세요.\n5-7가지 강점, 5-7가지 약점, 5-7가지 기회, 5-7가지 위협을 나열하세요.\n이것들로부터 다음을 나열하세요:\n강점을 두 배로 활용하는 아이디어 3가지\n약점을 고치거나 우회하는 아이디어 3가지\n기회를 포착하는 아이디어 3가지\n위협에 대비하는 아이디어 3가지\n모든 것을 간결한 글머리 기호로 제시하세요.\n        \n7. 역할극으로 다양한 관점 얻기: 미처 몰랐던 니즈 발굴\n우리는 모두 자기만의 시각에 갇히기 쉬워요. 역할극 브레인스토밍(Rolestorming)은 다른 사람의 입장이 되어 생각해보는 기법인데, 제품이나 프로세스의 페인 포인트(Pain Point)를 찾는 데 정말 탁월한 효과를 발휘합니다. 내가 미처 생각하지 못했던 필요나 개선점들을 발견하게 해주거든요.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (페르소나):\n초보 사용자: '용어가 너무 어려워요. 초보자를 위한 쉬운 설명이나 용어 사전이 필요해요.'\n파워 사용자: '심화 자료나 다른 전문가와의 네트워킹 기회가 있으면 좋겠어요.'\n경쟁사: '이 뉴스레터는 특정 주제에 대한 심층 분석이 부족하고, 인터랙티브 요소가 약해.'\n작가로서, 저는 이 프롬프트 덕분에 다양한 독자층의 니즈를 파악하고 콘텐츠를 미세 조정하는 데 큰 도움을 받았습니다. 여러 페르소나에서 공통적으로 발견되는 인사이트는 콘텐츠를 더 넓은 독자층에 맞게 다듬는 데 정말 핵심적이라고 할 수 있죠. 아마 여러분도 이 과정을 통해 예상치 못한 보물을 발견하실 거예요.\n[주제]에 대해 \"역할 브레인스토밍\"을 할 것입니다.\n다음 관점에서 생각하세요:\n– 초보자\n– 파워 사용자\n– 주요 이해관계자\n– 경쟁사\n각 페르소나에 대해 그들이 주장할 5가지 아이디어, 요청 또는 개선 사항을 나열하세요.\n그리고 최고의 아이디어를 하나의 우선순위 목록으로 통합하세요.\n        \n8. 아이디어를 실행 가능한 로드맵으로 전환하기: 실질적인 계획\n브레인스토밍이 아무리 멋진 아이디어를 쏟아냈어도, 그것들이 그냥 문서 속에서 잠들어버린다면 아무 소용이 없겠죠? 이 프롬프트는 아이디어를 실제 행동으로 옮길 수 있는 구체적인 로드맵으로 전환시켜 줍니다. 단순히 직감에만 의존하는 것이 아니라, 영향력(Impact)과 노력(Effort)을 기준으로 아이디어를 평가하게 함으로써 가장 효과적인 계획을 세울 수 있도록 도와줘요. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 최상의 아이디어는 직감과 어느 정도의 객관적인 증거 사이의 균형에서 나온다고 생각합니다.\n  아이디어 분류 기준:\nQuick wins (빠른 성과): 적은 노력으로 큰 영향력을 낼 수 있는 아이디어\nLong bets (장기 투자): 큰 노력이 필요하지만 장기적으로 엄청난 영향력을 가져올 아이디어\nExperiments (실험): 시도해 볼 만하지만 불확실성이 있는 아이디어\nCancel (취소): 영향력은 낮고 노력은 많이 드는 비효율적인 아이디어\n\n\n제대로 된 브레인스토밍의 마지막은 항상 실행 가능한 계획이어야 한다고 생각해요. 챗GPT와 함께라면 이런 과정도 훨씬 체계적이고 효율적으로 진행할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 뉴스레터 관련 아이디어 3가지에 대해 2주간의 실행 계획을 세우는 거죠. 정말 생산적이지 않나요?\n제가 제공하는 아이디어 목록을 실용적인 실행 로드맵으로 전환하세요.\n각 아이디어를 영향력(1-5)과 노력(1-5) 기준으로 평가하고 간략한 설명을 덧붙이세요.\n이를 빠른 성과(Quick wins), 장기 투자(Long bets), 실험(Experiments), 취소(Cancel)로 분류하세요.\n최고의 아이디어 3개를 테스트하기 위한 구체적인 작업이 포함된 2주 실행 계획을 제안하세요.\n        \n생산적인 브레인스토밍은 단순히 더 좋은 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 우리 자신의 맹점(Blind Spots)을 이해하는 과정이기도 합니다. 모든 프롬프트를 다 사용할 필요는 없어요 (물론 다 사용하면 좋긴 합니다!). 초기 설정 프롬프트로 시작한 뒤, 발산적 프롬프트 하나와 SWOT 분석 같은 '아이디어 검증용' 프롬프트를 조합해보세요. 아마 생각지도 못했던 명확성의 비약적인 상승을 경험하게 될 겁니다. 2026년, ChatGPT와 함께 여러분의 생각의 지평을 더욱 넓혀나가시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1. 명확한 컨텍스트 설정: ChatGPT에게 구체적인 목표와 제약 조건을 미리 알려 일반적인 답변을 방지하세요.\n2. 다양한 사고 확장: 발산적 사고, 역 브레인스토밍, 무작위 단어, SCAMPER를 활용해 사고의 폭을 넓히세요.\n3. 아이디어 현실 점검: SWOT 분석과 역할극을 통해 아이디어의 강점, 약점, 기회, 위협을 파악하고 다양한 관점을 통합하세요.\n4. 실행 가능한 로드맵: 아이디어를 영향력과 노력 기준으로 평가하고, 단기 성과, 장기 투자, 실험, 취소 항목으로 분류하여 구체적인 실행 계획을 세우세요.\n  이 프롬프트들을 활용하면 여러분의 브레인스토밍이 훨씬 더 깊고 실용적으로 변할 거예요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: ChatGPT 브레인스토밍 프롬프트를 사용할 때 가장 중요한 점은 무엇인가요?\n가장 중요한 건 명확한 컨텍스트와 목표를 설정하는 거예요. ChatGPT를 단순한 아이디어 자동판매기가 아닌, 구조화된 브레인스토밍 파트너로 생각하고 구체적인 지침을 제공할수록 훨씬 더 유용하고 깊이 있는 결과를 얻을 수 있답니다. 마치 유능한 팀원에게 정확한 프로젝트 브리핑을 하는 것과 비슷하다고 보면 돼요!\nQ2: 여러 프롬프트를 어떻게 조합해서 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\n저는 보통 초기 설정 프롬프트(#1)로 시작해서, 발산적 사고를 위한 프롬프트(#2)로 아이디어의 양을 늘려요. 그 다음, 역 브레인스토밍(#3)이나 SWOT 분석(#6) 같은 '검증용' 프롬프트로 아이디어를 점검하죠. 이렇게 하면 초기 아이디어의 맹점을 파악하고 보완할 수 있어서 정말 도움이 된답니다. 상황에 따라 SCAMPER(#5)나 역할극(#7)을 추가해서 더 깊이 있는 아이디어를 발굴하기도 해요.\nQ3: ChatGPT가 생성한 아이디어가 너무 일반적일 때는 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n음, 이런 경우도 자주 있죠! 그럴 때는 먼저 컨텍스트를 더 구체적으로 설명하는 게 좋아요. 예를 들어, \"이 아이디어를 20대 여성 직장인을 위한 뉴스레터에 적용한다면?\" 같이 대상 독자나 특정 상황을 더 명확히 제시하는 거죠. 그리고 역 브레인스토밍(#3)을 통해 '어떻게 하면 이 아이디어를 망칠 수 있을까?'를 고민해보면, 의외로 신선한 해결책이 나올 때가 많아요.\nQ4: 이 프롬프트들을 어디에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\n개인적으로는 콘텐츠 기획, 마케팅 전략 수립, 제품 개발 아이디어 도출, 개인적인 목표 설정 등 다양한 분야에서 활용도가 높았어요. 특히 혼자서 막막할 때나 팀원들과 새로운 시각이 필요할 때 ChatGPT를 유능한 동료 삼아 이 프롬프트들을 적용해보면, 생각지도 못한 인사이트를 얻을 수 있을 거예요.\n\n\n        {\n          \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n          \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n          \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n              \"@type\": \"Question\",\n              \"name\": \"ChatGPT 브레인스토밍 프롬프트를 사용할 때 가장 중요한 점은 무엇인가요?\",\n              \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"가장 중요한 건 명확한 컨텍스트와 목표를 설정하는 거예요.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "본인이 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피이거나, 또는 주변에 이렇게 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피 친구와 지인이 항상 몇 명씩 누구나 있을 것이다. 철면피는 말 그대로 얼굴이 두꺼워서 남의 비판을 신경 쓰지 않는 뻔뻔한 사람을 뜻하는데, ‘얼굴에 철판을 깔았다’라는 말도 우리는 자주 사용한다. 이 말은 어떻게, 언제 쓰이냐에 따라 긍정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있고, 부정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있는데, 오늘은 아주 긍정적인 의미에서의 철면피에 대해서 이야기해 보려고 한다.\n얼마 전에 미국의 슈퍼 어디에서나 볼 수 있는 저당 간식 스키니딥드(SkinnyDipped)의 창업 이야기를 팟캐스트로 들었다. 초코 코팅 아몬드인데, 주로 다크초콜릿을 사용하고 코팅을 아주 얇게 해서 다른 간식보다 당과 열량이 낮은 제품인데, 모든 창업 이야기가 웬만한 TV 드라마보다 드라마틱하듯이, 이 회사의 이야기도 너무 재미있었다. 이 회사의 창업 초기에는 내가 다른 스타트업의 창업 초기에서도 항상 발견하는 공통점이 있었는데, 바로 창업가들의 철면피와 뻔뻔스러움이다. 엄마와 딸이 창업한 회사인데 제품을 오프라인 유통업체에 입점시키기 위해서 초반에는 두 분이 별의별 짓을 다 했다. 일단 Whole Foods 입점을 위해 간식 담당자를 만나기 위해서 매일 매장에서 하염없이 기다린 이야기도 있고(우리가 투자한 회사의 대표도 실제로 이렇게 한 적이 있는데, 이건 요새도 잘 먹히는 방법이다.), 더 재미있었던 에피소드는 회사의 본사가 있던 시애틀의 구글 건물에 몰래 들어가서, 구내식당에서 어슬렁거리면서 쉐프를 찾았고, 스키니딥드 제품을 구글 직원들에게 간식으로 제공해야 한다고 설득한 이야기다.\n이런 두꺼운 낯짝으로 고객사, 투자사, 협력사에 쳐들어가는 건 내가 아는 매우 많은 창업가가 창업 초기에 했던할 수밖에 없었던 공통된 필수 코스인데, 실제로 사업을 하다 보면 누구나 다 이렇게 해야 하는 시점이 있다. 그리고 정말 성공하고 싶다면 모든 창업가들이 이렇게 철면피를 깔고, 일반인들은 쪽팔려서 절대로 하지 못하는, 그런 일들을 해야 한다.\n나도 오래전에 영업하면서 철면피 영업을 했었고, 뮤직쉐이크를 하면서도 여러 번 이런 경험이 있고, 스트롱을 처음 시작할 때도 그냥 여기저기 쳐들어가서 달성하고자 하는 일을 시도해 본 적이 있다. 모든 쳐들어감이 성공하진 못했고, 어떤 경우에는 철면피가 찢어지기도 했지만, 어쨌든 나는 정말 간절했고, 그 간절함이 당시에 이런 두꺼운 낯짝을 형성해 준 것 같다.\n나도 이런 경험을 직접 해봤기 때문에 우리 투자사 대표님들에게도 가끔 이렇게 해야 한다고 하는데, 많은 분들이 “저는 그런 거 원래 못해요” , “뭐, 그렇게까지 해야 하나요?”라는 말을 한다. 나는 “네, 그렇게까지 해야 합니다.”라고 하지만, 실제로 철면피를 깔고 행동할 수 있는 분들은 그렇게 많지 않다.\n그런데 이분들이 잘 모르는 사실이 하나 있다. 위에서 말한 스키니딥드 창업가나 과거의 나 같은 사람도 태어날 때부터 쪽팔림을 모르고, 남의 시선을 신경 쓰지 않고, 철면피였던 건 아니다. 이들도 당연히 안 만나주려고 하는 사람들의 사무실에 불쑥 쳐들어가거나, 누가 건물의 출입구를 열어주기를 하염없이 추위에서 기다리거나, 안 사겠다고 하는 잠재 고객사 대표의 새벽 출근길 자가용의 문을 기사님 대신 매일 열어주고 인사하는 짓을 너무너무 즐겁고 기쁘게 하진 않을 것이다. 이들에게도 아주 창피하고, 자존심 상하고, 하기 싫은 일이지만, 해야 하니까 하는 것이다.\n모든 창업가에겐 어느 정도의 철면피가 꼭 필요하다고 나는 생각한다. 이들이 회사를 처음 창업하고, 회사가 어느 정도 궤도에 올라가기 전까지는 대부분 투자자들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 협력업체들이 협업하고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 좋은 잠재 임직원분들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람인데, 나를 만나기 싫거나 나에게 관심이 없는 사람과 만나서 이야기할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 그냥 얼굴에 철판 깔고 쳐들어가는 것이다. 아주 힘들고, 아주 쪽팔리고, 아주 자존심 상하고, 굳이 이렇게까지 해야 하나 생각이 드는, 그런 행동이지만, 사업을 하기 위해서는 필요한 일이다. 왜냐하면, 이렇게 무리수를 둬서 일단 만나면 그 이후에 안 될 일도 되는 것을 나는 직접 경험해봤고, 여러 번 옆에서 목격했기 때문이다.\n다시 한번 강조한다. 그 누구도 철면피를 갖고 태어나진 않았다. 꼭 필요하고, 꼭 해야 하니까 낯짝을 두껍게 만든 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나는 개인적으로 학생 창업가를 좋아하고, 이들이 창업하는 걸 적극적으로 추천하고 응원한다. 우리가 학생 창업가에게만 전문적으로 투자하거나 이들에게만 투자하는 펀드가 있는 건 아니지만, 스트롱은 지금까지 꾸준히 대학생 창업팀에 투자하고 있고 이들이 하는 몇 개의 이벤트를 후원하고 있다. 그리고 우린 모두 다 바빠서 외부 강연이나 발표는 거의 안, 못 하고 있는데, 학생들 대상의 강연이나 발표, 또는 해커톤 심사는 웬만하면 시간을 만들어서 참석하고 있다. 창업가들의 나이는 점점 더 낮아지고 있는데, 우리가 지향하는 첫 번째 기관투자자가 되기 위해서는 이제는 학생들에게 투자해야 하기 때문이다. 결국 이 학생들은 스트롱의 미래의 고객이기 때문에 우리가 학생들 대상으로 하는 모든 활동은 잠재 고객에 대한 영업/마케팅 활동이라고 봐도 무방하다. 이들이 지금 또는 나중에 창업할 때, 가장 먼저 생각나는 VC가 스트롱벤처스가 되는 게 우리의 목표다.\n내가 스트롱을 시작한 2012년만 해도 학생들은 창업을 거의 하지 않았다. 창업이 뭔지도 몰랐고, 어떻게 하는지도 몰랐고, 이들에게 투자해 주는 VC도 없었다. 창업은 취업하지 못하면 어쩔 수 없이 선택해야 하는 마지막 옵션이었기 때문에 내가 당시에 만났던 학생 창업가들은 준비도 안 됐고, 실력도 없었다. 실은, 아직도 대부분의 학부생이나 대학원생들은 취업을 선호하긴 하지만, 요샌 창업을 1순위로 생각하는 학생들이 점점 더 많아지고 있다는 게 내 개인적인 생각이다.\n요새도 우린 더 많은 학생 창업가를 만나기 위한 방법에 대해서 고민하고 있는데, 혹시 이 글을 읽는 학생분들 중 좋은 방법이 있다면 언제든지 제안해 주시면 좋겠다.\n이미 창업했거나, 창업을 생각하는 학생들에게 내가 몇 가지 해주고 싶은 조언이 있다. 꼭 이렇게 하라는 건 아니지만, 창업하기 전에 충분히 생각해 봐야 하는 주제들이고, 몇 개는 나중에 회사가 켜졌을 때 이 회사를 완전히 망가뜨릴 수 있는 중요한 내용이라고 생각한다.\n일단 가장 첫 번째 조언은, 사업은 학교 과제가 아니라는 것이다. 내가 만나는 많은 학생 창업가는 실은 학생 창업가가 아니라 그냥 창업 과제를 하는 학생이다. 이들은 사업할 준비가 전혀 되지 않았고, 그냥 학업 외 재미있는 일을 하고 싶고, 멀리서 다른 창업가를 보니까 본인들도 할 수 있을 것 같다는 생각으로 법인설립하고 대표이사 명함 만들고, 코파운더 명함 만들면서 여기저기 기웃거리는 수준의 활동을 하고 있다. 어떤 분은 소위 말하는 스타트업 대표이사 놀이에 빠져있고, 졸업하고 대기업에 취직하는 게 목적인데, 이력서에 “ABC 창업 경험” 한 줄 달기 위해서 창업을 하는 경우도 있었다. 이렇게 하다 보니, 당연히 사업을 풀타임으로 안 한다. 학업을 하면서 사업을 병행하는데, 이렇게 대충대충, 건성건성 해서 제대로 된 사업을 만들 수 있다면, 우리가 14년 동안 투자한 290개의 회사는 모두 다 유니콘이 돼야 했다.\n그래서 내가 학생 창업가에게 가장 먼저 드리고 싶은 조언은, 정말로 제대로 사업을 하려면 일단 그 마음가짐부터 제대로 가지고, 이를 실제로 행동에 옮기려면 학업을 휴학하거나, 아니면 자퇴하라는 것이다. 이렇게 하지 않고서는 절대로 제대로 사업을 할 수가 없다. 너무 이진법적인 생각 같지만, 창업은 all in or nothing이다.\n두 번째 조언은, 교수님의 말을 맹신하지 말라는 것이다. 그리고 되도록 창업하는 회사의 주주명부에서 교수님은 빼거나, 아니면 이들의 지분을 2% 이하로 낮추라는 조언을 드리고 싶다. 내가 만나는 대부분의 학생 창업 스타트업은, 그리고 특히 지도교수가 있는 대학원생이 창업한 스타트업의 창업팀에는 지도교수가 들어가 있다. 그리고 대부분의 경우 이들은 30% 이상의 지분을 보유하고 있다. 이게 왜 틀렸는지는 내가 전에 이 글에서 대략 설명했는데, 다시 한번 간략하게 요약하자면, 스타트업의 코파운더는 1년 365일 하루 24시간 이 사업 생각만 해야 하고, 이 사업에 그 무엇보다 높은 우선순위를 둬야 한다. 교수들은 이게 구조적으로 안 된다. 왜냐하면 학교가 이들의 직장이라서 항상 학교가 이들의 우선순위이기 때문이다. 나는 회사가 잘 되면 가장 고생하고 기여를 많이 한 사람들이 가장 많은 돈을 벌어야 한다고 생각하는데 지분이 이걸 결정한다. 회사가 안 되면 역시 지분이 가장 많은 분들이 모든 책임과 비난을 받아야 한다. 하지만, 이 회사에 all in 하지 않고, 시간이 날 때마다 와서 파트타임으로 조언과 훈수를 하는 교수들이 지분을 이렇게 많이 보유하는 건 확실히 불공평하다고 생각한다. 어떤 교수들은 학교에서 가르치고, 본인이 창업한 회사가 있고, 지도하는 학생들이 창업한 3~4개 회사의 높은 지분을 보유한 C 레벨 임원으로 활동하고 있는데, 이런 구조로 회사가 나중에 투자받고, 좋은 사람을 채용하고, 잘 되는 건 쉽지 않다.\n그래서 되도록 교수는 창업팀에서 빼라. 꼭 이들의 조언이나 도움이 필요하다면 스톡옵션을 0.5% 이하로 주고 고문으로 모시는 걸 권장한다. 전에 어떤 학생 대표에게 이런 이야기를 하니까 굉장히 곤란해하면서 나에게 다음과 같은 말을 했다. 본인도 졸업해야 하는데, 지도교수님이 승인하지 않으면 졸업을 못 하므로 이런 껄끄러운 대화를 하는 게 너무 힘들다고. 그래서 내가 위에서 말한 대로 진짜로 사업을 하려면 그냥 학업을 중단하는 게 이런 졸업의 고민으로부터 자유로워질 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법이다. 아니면, 교수님과 이 힘든 대화를 해서 쇼부를 봐야 한다. 사업하면 이보다 훨씬 더 어려운 대화를 많이 해야 하고 훨씬 더 힘든 결정을 많이 해야 하는데, 여기서부터 막힌다면 사업 못 한다.\n마지막 조언은, 스타트업은 돈을 버는 사업을 만드는 곳이지, 그 누구도 따라 할 수 없는 기술을 개발하는 조직이 아니라는 점이다. 본인이 현재 개발하고 연구하는 분야가 세계 최고 수준이라면 이건 정말 대단하고 축하할만하다. 하지만, 그렇다고 이게 세계 최고의 사업이 된다는 보장은 없다. 아니, 그렇게 되는 경우는 거의 없다. 그럼, 노벨상 받은 모든 이론과 기술이 유니콘 사업이 돼야 한다. 기술은 그냥 단지 기술일 뿐이다. 이 기술을 기반으로 비즈니스 모델을 만들고, 더 나아가서는 돈을 버는 사업으로 진화시키는 건 완전히 다른 일이다. 연구보다 사업이 더 어렵다는 말이 아니다. 그냥 완전히 다르다는 말이다.\n우리 같은 VC는 기술에 투자하지 않는다. 그 기술로 만드는 돈을 버는 사업에 투자한다. 이걸 명확하게 이해해야 한다. \n나는 젊고, 똑똑하고, 에너지 넘치는 학생 창업가를 정말 좋아한다. 이들이 맘먹고 사고 치면 유니콘이 아니라 데카콘 몇 마리 만들 수 있다고 믿는다. 나는 더 많은 학생이 창업해야 한다고 생각한다. 특히, 위에서 말한 내용에 대해서 충분히 고민해 본 학생 창업가들이라면 언제든지 스트롱에 연락해 주시길.",

《사하촌》 중, 1936\n김정한의 소설 《사하촌》을 보면 일제강점기 소작제도의 현실이 얼마나 고단했는지가 잘 묘사된다. 풍년이면 쌀값이 싸져서 돈을 못벌고, 흉년이면 내다 팔 쌀이 없어서 돈을 못벌었다. 조선 후기 민중들의 삶은 팍팍하기 그지없었다. 그래도 삶은 계속되어야 하고 자식들은 먹여살려야 하지 않겠는가. 오늘날 우리가 대출 이자에 시달리듯 그때의 민중들은 동네 양반지주들에게 땅과 쌀을 빌렸다. 그런데 이게 문제였다. 당시 ‘장리’라고 불렸던 이자가 너무 컸기 때문이다. \n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}‘1년에 5할’, 보릿고개 시절 쌀을 빌리면 50%를 더하여 갚는 방식인데 ‘십오지사채’라고도 불렸다. 자기 땅을 가지고 있으면 20%의 세금을 내지만 땅을 빌리면 이자를 두 배 이상을 내야 했다. 비율제였기 때문에 쌀 100석을 생산하면 50석, 150석을 생산하면 75석을 내야하는 식이었다. 식량이 부족한 봄철, 이른바 춘궁기에 쌀을 빌리면 또다시 50%의 이자가 붙었다. 그 결과 추수 때가 되면 생산량의 60~80%를 이자로 내야 하는 경우도 적지 않았다. 임술농민봉기(1862), 동학농민운동(1894) 등 구한말 농민들의 저항이 계속된 이유도 결국은 무자비한 이자 때문이었다.\n소작 문제는 일제강점기 들어 더욱 악화되었다. 제국주의 본국에서 식민지 백성들의 고통에 무슨 관심이 있겠는가. 순사들은 모른 척으로 일관했고 총독부는 지주 편이었기 때문에 농민은 소작권마저 보장받지 못했다. 소설 《사하촌》에서는 갑자기 소작권을 빼앗겨서 어려움을 겪게 되는 농민 이야기부터 위에 나온 것처럼 빚을 감당하지 못하다 자신의 땅마저 빼앗기는 온갖 비극적인 이야기가 담겨있다.\n이자는 시대마다 다른 이름으로 불려 왔지만, 그 역사는 오래됐다. ‘돈놀이’나 ‘사채’ 같은 표현이 말해주듯, 돈을 빌려주고 이자를 받는 행위에 대한 경계와 불신은 고대부터 존재해왔다. 돈이나 땅을 빌려주어 이익을 얻는 사람들이 생겨났고, 이자를 감당하며 생계를 이어가는 방식 역시 시대와 지역을 가리지 않고 반복됐다.\n하지만 근대 산업혁명을 거치며 이자의 의미는 달라지기 시작한다. 금융 제도가 정비되고 경제를 운영하는 방식에 대한 이해가 깊어지면서, 이자는 개인 간 거래를 넘어 보다 조직적이고 전문적인 경제 활동의 일부로 자리 잡게 된다. 이 변화의 흐름 속에서, 이자를 다루는 방식으로 시대를 앞서간 ‘지아니니’라는 사람이 있었다.\n기회: 뱅크 오브 아메리카와 백설공주\n아마데오 지아니니(1870~1949)는 이탈리아 이민자 가정에서 태어났다. 미국 남북전쟁 이후 산업화와 국가 재건이 본격화되면서, 많은 이탈리아 이민자들이 미국에 자리를 잡았고 지아니니의 가족도 그중 하나였다. 당시 많은 이민자들이 그렇듯 지아니니 역시 13살의 어린 나이에 일을 시작했고 우연한 기회에 임대사업을 접한 후 장인의 부동산 사업을 도우며 돈의 흐름을 익혀갔다.\n31살이 되던 해 장인이 세상을 떠나자 지아니니는 샌프란시스코에 ‘뱅크 오브 이탈리아(Bank of Italy)’라는 작은 회사를 차렸다. 금융에 대한 이해가 부족하고 신용도가 낮아 기존 은행에서는 담보를 통한 대출이 불가능한 이들을 상대로 한 회사였다. 일종의 틈새시장을 노린 셈이지만, 대출 규모가 낮고 연체 위험 또한 높기 때문에 큰 수익을 보기 어려운 구조이기도 했다.\n2년간 어렵게 회사를 꾸려오던 1906년 4월 18일, 샌프란시스코를 강타한 대지진이 모든 것을 뒤흔들었다. 지아니니는 곧장 은행으로 달려가 200만 달러 규모의 금과 현금, 유가증권 등을 간신히 챙겨 나온다. 이날 지진은 규모 8.3으로, 약 3,000명의 사망자와 도시 인구의 절반을 넘는 23만 명의 이재민을 남긴 미국 역사상 최악의 지진 재해였다. 지진의 여파로 화재가 잇따르면서 지역의 군소 은행들은 무너졌고, 일부 은행은 금고가 녹아내릴 정도였다. 수많은 사람들의 재산이 하루아침에 공중으로 사라졌다.\n하지만 빠른 대응으로 자신과 고객의 자산을 지켜낸 지아니니에게 재난은 기회가 되었다. 그는 샌프란시스코 북쪽 해변 근처 부두에 자리를 잡고 나무 판자와 배럴을 책상 삼아, 삶의 터전을 잃은 사람들을 직접 만났다. 대지진과 화재로 모든 것을 잃은 이탈리아 이민자들에게 기존 은행들은 뻣뻣하게 굴었다. 담보가 없다는 이유로 대출을 거절했기 때문이다.\n하지만 지아니니의 선택은 달랐다. 그는 이민자들의 이야기를 직접 듣고, 사업 계획이 분명하다면 구매 물품을 담보 삼아 대출을 실행했다. 소문은 빠르게 퍼졌고, 작은 술집을 개조해 쓰던 은행은 곧 샌프란시스코 리틀 이탤리의 상징인 콜럼버스타워로 자리를 옮기게 된다. 소상공인의 사정을 이해하고 그에 맞는 금융을 설계한 지아니니의 방식이 힘을 발휘한 순간이었다.\n당시만 하더라도 금융은 미국 동부, 특히 뉴욕의 금융기관들이 꽉 잡고 있었고, 이들은 미국 서부를 변방으로 여겼다. 급변하던 샌프란시스코와 캘리포니아의 경제를 제대로 이해하지 못한 것도 사실이었다. 당시 미국 서부는 뜨거웠다. 일명 골드러시. 수많은 사람들이 몰려 들었고 항구와 철도같은 대단위 사업은 물론이고 이민자를 중심으로 과일, 와인, 통조림 등 농업과 식품산업이 커나가고 있었다. 지진에도 불구하고 재건 붐이 일며 서부는 빠르게 변화하고 있었다.\n20세기 초 호황기와 전쟁기를 거치며 그는 적극적인 대출을 이어갔고, 주법 은행과 국법 은행으로 나뉘어 있던 미국의 금융 시스템을 유연하게 활용해 사업을 빠르게 확장했다. 기존의 사업을 키우고 새로운 은행을 인수합병하는 가운데 그의 은행은 1928년 ‘뱅크 오브 아메리카(Bank of America)’로 이름이 바뀌었으며 이후 미국을 대표하는 금융기관으로 자리 잡는다.\n가난한 이탈리아 이민자를 상대하던 꼬마은행 사업가에서 미국을 대표하는 은행으로 성장하기까지. 지아니니는 합병과 인수를 거듭하며 기업이나 정치권과 교묘히 결탁하는 등 미국 금융계를 시끌벅적하게 만든 인물이기도 하다. 하지만 그의 뚝심과 소외된 영역에 과감히 투자하는 방식은 통했다.\n그는 월트 디즈니 스튜디오의 대출을 주관하기도 했다. 당시만 해도 ‘동화로 만든 만화영화를 누가 보겠느냐’는 인식이 투자자들 사이에서 지배적이었다. 하지만 지아니니는 제작 중이던 영화의 일부를 직접 확인한 뒤, 영화 필름 자체를 담보로 자금을 내주었다. 당시 디즈니는 제작비가 200만 달러 이상 초과되어 난항을 겪고 있었는데, 지아니니의 투자로 탄생한 작품이 바로 《백설공주와 일곱난쟁이》다. \n이후 찰리 채플린을 비롯해 20세기 폭스, 컬럼비아 영화사 등 여러 창작자와 기업이 지아니니의 금융 지원을 받으며 성장했다. 20세기 미국 대중문화사에서 그의 안목있는 투자 방식은 문화 산업의 위상을 바꾸어놓았다고 해도 과언이 아니다.\n질서: 세계의 시선을 한 몸에 받는 FED의 정책\n조선 후기와 일제강점기 조선 농민을 괴롭혔던 소작료, 그리고 산업혁명기 이탈리아 이민자들과 새로운 사업에 도움을 주었던 지아니니의 대출 사업. 두 사례에서 알 수 있듯 '이자'는 매우 이중적인 성격을 지니고 있다. 과도한 이자는 삶을 위협하지만, 이자 수익을 전제로 한 과감한 투자가 없으면 산업은 앞으로 나아가기 어렵다. 생계와 성장, 개인의 삶과 국가 경제. 이자는 이 두 세계가 만나는 지점에서 가장 현실적인 문제이기도 하다.\n아마 이 지점에서 자신의 역할을 가장 분명하게 수행한 인물이 매리너 애클스(Marriner Stoddard Eccles, 1890~1977)일 것이다. 사업가 출신이었던 그는 민주당 정부에서 연방준비제도(이하 연준)*의 위상을 이전과는 다른 차원으로 끌어올린 인물로 평가받는다.\n*미국의 통화금융정책을 수행하는 중앙은행제도, 보통 약자인 FED(Federal Reserve System)로 불린다.\n애클스가 프랭클린 루스벨트 대통령 시절 정부에 합류했을 당시만 해도, 연준은 여전히 19세기의 원칙을 그대로 따르고 있었다. 이른바 ‘진성어음주의’라 불리던 원칙에 따라, 경제활동에 적정한 상업어음을 할인해주는 것이 중앙은행의 역할이라고 여겼기 때문이다. 경제에 직접 개입하기보다는, 실물경제를 조용히 뒷받침하는 역할에 가까웠다.\n하지만 애클스가 살았던 시대는 그야말로 격변의 시기였다. 1929년 대공황으로 대량 실업이 발생했고, 설상가상으로 제2차 세계대전에, 6.25전쟁까지 벌어졌다. 국가도 개인도, 급변하는 정세에 위협받던 시기였다. 애클스가 보기에 적정한 통화정책과 규제정책의 실천은 단순히 나라 경제를 일으키는 것을 넘어 국민들의 삶을 돌보는 중요한 수단이었다. 경기가 침체될 때는 숨통을 틔워주고, 반대로 과열될 때는 속도를 늦춰야 한다는 것이 그의 생각이었다. 시장의 성장을 무작정 뒷받침하기보다, 물가 안정과 지속적인 성장을 함께 관리하는 기준이 필요하다고 보았다.\n애클스는 루스벨트 대통령을 설득했고, 연방준비제도법 개정 등 굵직한 제도 개혁을 이끌어냈다. 무엇보다 그는 연준의 독립과 자율성을 위한 제도적인 방안을 마련하는 데 동분서주했다. 재무부 장관과 차관의 연준 참여를 제한하고, 연준 이사의 교체 주기도 정권 교체에 영향을 받지 않는 방식으로 조정했으며, 대통령의 임기 동안 연준 위원 임명에 제한을 두었다. 즉, 로비스트들에 크게 영향을 받는 정권의 이해 관계를 벗어나 거시적인 경제정책을 추진하기 위한 제도적 기반을 만들었다. 소위 ‘금리 정책’을 통해 국민 경제의 안정을 기하는 방식, 대출 이자의 적정성을 도모하면서 기업과 가계에 도움이 되는 전통이 애클스에 의해 본격화된 것이다.\n침식: 나라를 담보로 한 대출\n조선 말 국가의 재정 상태는 엉망이었다. ‘나라에는 한 달 쓸 비축도 없다’라는 말이 나올 지경이었다. 서양 열강과 청나라, 일본의 간섭을 막으려면 국가 주도의 적극적인 근대화 정책이 필요했다. 하지만 철도를 놓고 전신을 연결하는 대단위 산업을 위해서는 막대한 양의 자금이 필요했고, 조선은 결정적으로 자금이 부족했다.\n이 와중에 1882년 임오군란을 진압하기 위해 청나라 군대가 조선에 파견됐고, 이때 중국의 정치인 이홍장은 자신의 심복인 원세개(위안스카이)를 함께 보낸다. 원세개의 목표는 명확했다. 막대한 자금을 대출해주고 조선을 청나라에 예속시킬 것. 정치력을 극대화하여 일본의 간섭을 뿌리치고 조선을 식민지로 만들 것. 이러한 원칙하에 원세개는 적극적인 차관 정책을 추진하였다.\n1882년 8월 조선은 청나라로부터 50만 냥의 돈을 연이자 8리(0.8%), 거치 7년 상환 조건으로 빌렸다. 개화 정책을 추진하기 위해 빌려온 대규모 차관이었다. 1885년 6월에는 ‘의주전선 조약’을 체결했는데 전신 시설을 위해 5년 거치 20년 기한으로 10만 냥의 차관을 또 빌렸다. 이 조약은 파격적이었다. 이자를 받지 않았기 때문이다. 대신 매년 5,000냥씩 무이자 상환을 하되 상환이 어려울 경우 전선부설권 및 관리권을 청나라가 갖는 것을 조건으로 했다. 1889년이 되면 조선이 청나라에게 빌린 돈이 130만 냥에 달했다.\n당시 조선은 갑신정변 때 피해를 이유로 배상금을 요구했던 일본의 5만 냥을 갚지 못해 세창양행* 같은 해외 기업으로부터 돈을 빌리고 있었다. 하지만 원세개는 끊임없는 내정간섭을 통해 청나라 이외의 나라에서부터 차관을 들여오는 것을 막았고, 그만큼 조선의 시장과 산업을 지배하였다. 물론 이 시도는 1894년 청일전쟁에서 청나라가 일본에 의해 완전히 패배하면서 끝나게 된다. 하지만 이후 일본은 같은 방식으로 조선을 집어삼키는 데 성공한다.\n*1884년 독일 마이어 상사(Meyer 商社)의 제물포 지점으로 설립된 무역상사. 근대화 정책을 명분으로 독일산 기계와 기술자 도입을 담당하며 각종 이권을 확보한 창구 역할을 했다.\n이 사례는 19-20세기 제국주의 국가들이 약소국을 지배해온 전형적인 방식이기도 하다. 자금에 의존하게 한 후, 빚은 점차 통제와 간섭으로 이어졌다. 돈을 빌려 감당할 수 없는 이자의 늪에 빠지는 것은 개인의 생계를 넘어, 때로는 국가의 존망까지 좌우하는 문제로 확장된다.\n사실 대출이자 몇 퍼센트가 올랐냐, 떨어졌냐를 두고 희비가 엇갈리는 것이 평범한 우리의 일상이다. 하지만 금리라는 숫자 뒤에는 언제나 더 큰 이야기가 놓여있다. 앞서 살펴본 네 가지 역사적 사례처럼 정부의 정책, 경기의 흐름, 그리고 국제사회의 변화 같은 구조적인 배경이 있다는 사실을 기억해야 한다. 지아니니와 애클스가 좋은 선례를 만들었던 것처럼, 이자와 금리는 책임 있게 다뤄질 때 기회와 질서가 된다.\n당연한 이야기지만, 좋은 정책을 통해 안정적으로 금리가 관리될 때 사람들은 삶을 잘 꾸리고 미래를 계획해 나갈 수 있다. 그리고 좋은 정책의 출발점에는 ‘세상이 어떻게 흘러가고 변화하는가’를 냉정하게 바라보는 국민들의 시선이 있다. 정부는 언제나 국민의 눈치를 보기 때문이다. 따라서 우리의 시선은 보다 이성적이면서도 공공적인 방향을 가리킬 필요가 있다.",
