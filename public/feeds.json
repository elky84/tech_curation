        "content:encodedSnippet": "WHAT IT IS\nThe rise of agentic software development means code is being written, reviewed, and shipped faster than ever before across the entire industry. It also means that testing frameworks need to evolve for this rapidly changing landscape. Faster development demands faster testing that can catch bugs as they land in a codebase, without requiring regular updates and maintenance.\nJust-in‑Time Tests (JiTTests) are a fundamentally novel approach to testing where tests are automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) on the fly to catch bugs – even ones that traditional testing might not catch – just-in-time before the code lands into production.\nA Catching JiTTest focuses specifically on finding regressions introduced by a code change. This type of testing reimagines decades of software testing theory and practice. While traditional testing relies on static test suites, manual authoring, and ongoing maintenance, Catching JiTTests require no test maintenance and no test code review, meaning engineers can focus their expertise on real bugs, not false positives. Catching JiTTests use sophisticated techniques to maximize test signal value and minimize false positive drag, targeting test signals where they matter most: on serious failures.\nHOW TESTING TRADITIONALLY WORKS\nUnder the traditional paradigm, tests are manually built as new code lands in a codebase and continually executed, requiring regular updates and maintenance. The engineers building these tests face the challenge of needing to check the behavior, not only of the current code, but all possible future changes. Inherent uncertainty about future changes results in tests that don’t catch anything, or when they do, it’s a false positive. Agentic development dramatically increases the pace of code change, straining test development burden and scaling the cost of false positives and test maintenance to breaking point. \nHOW CATCHING JITTESTS WORK\nBroadly, JiTTests are bespoke tests, tailored to a specific code change, that give engineers simple, actionable feedback about unexpected behavior changes without the need to read or write test code. LLMs can generate JiTTests automatically the moment a pull request is submitted. And since the JiTTest itself is LLM-generated, it can often infer the plausible intention of a code change and simulate possible faults that may result from it.\nWith an understanding of intent, Catching JiTTests can significantly drive down instances of false positives.\nHere are the key steps of the Catching JiTTest process:\nNew code lands in the codebase.\nThe system infers the intention of the code change.\nIt creates mutants (code versions with faults deliberately inserted) to simulate what could go wrong.\nIt generates and runs tests to catch those faults.\nEnsembles of rule-based and LLM-based assessors focus the signal on true positive failures.\nEngineers receive clear, relevant reports about unexpected changes right when it matters most.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCatching JiTTests are designed for the world of AI-powered agentic software development and accelerate testing by focusing on serious unexpected bugs. With them engineers no longer have to spend time writing, reviewing, and testing complex test code. Catching JiTTests, by design, kill many of the issues with traditional testing in one stroke:\nThey are generated on-the-fly for each code change and do not reside in the codebase, eliminating ongoing maintenance costs and shifting effort from humans to machines.\nThey are tailored to each change, making them more robust and less prone to breaking due to intended updates.\nThey automatically adapt as the code changes.\nThey only require human review when a bug is actually caught.\nThis all amounts to an important shift in testing infrastructure where the focus moves from generic code quality to whether a test actually finds faults in a specific change without raising a false positive. It helps improve testing overall while also allowing it to keep up with the pace of agentic coding.\nREAD THE PAPER\nJust-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta\nThe post The Death of Traditional Testing: Agentic Development Broke a 50-Year-Old Field, JiTTesting Can Revive It appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details of the role backend aggregation (BAG) plays in building Meta’s gigawatt-scale AI clusters like Prometheus.\nBAG allows us to seamlessly connect thousands of GPUs across multiple data centers and regions.\nOur BAG implementation is connecting two different network fabrics – Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF).\nOnce it’s complete our AI cluster, Prometheus, will deliver 1-gigawatt of capacity to enhance and enable new and existing AI experiences across Meta products. Prometheus’ infrastructure will span several data center buildings in a single larger region, interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs.\nA key piece of scaling and connecting this infrastructure is backend aggregation (BAG), which we use to seamlessly connect GPUs and data centers with robust, high-capacity networking. By leveraging modular hardware, advanced routing, and resilient topologies, BAG ensures both performance and reliability at unprecedented scale\nAs our AI clusters continue to grow, we expect BAG to play an important role in meeting future demands and driving innovation across Meta’s global network.\nWhat Is Backend Aggregation?\nBAG is a centralized Ethernet-based super spine network layer that primarily functions to interconnect multiple spine layer fabrics across various data centers and regions within large clusters. Within Prometheus, for example, the BAG layer serves as the aggregation point between regional networks and Meta’s backbone, enabling the creation of mega AI clusters. BAG is designed to support immense bandwidth needs, with inter-BAG capacities reaching the petabit range (e.g., 16-48 Pbps per region pair).\nWe use backend aggregation (BAG) to interconnect data center regions to share compute and other resources into large clusters.\nHow BAG Is Helping Us Build Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters \nTo address the challenge of interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs, we’re deploying distributed BAG layers regionally.\nHow We Interconnect BAG Layers\nBAG layers are strategically distributed across regions to serve subsets of L2 fabrics, adhering to distance, buffer, and latency constraints. Inter-BAG connectivity utilizes either a planar (direct match) or spread connection topology, chosen based on site size and fiber availability.\nPlanar topology connects BAG switches one-to-one between regions following the plane, offering simplified management but concentrating potential failure domains.\nSpread connection topology distributes links across multiple BAG switches/planes, enhancing path diversity and resilience.\nAn example of an inter-BAG network topology.\nHow a BAG Layer Connects to L2 Fabrics\nSo far, we’ve discussed how the BAG layers are interconnected, now let’s see how a BAG layer connects downstream to L2 fabrics.\nWe’ve used two main fabric technologies, Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) to build L2 networks.\nBelow is an example of DSF L2 zones across five data center buildings connected to the BAG layer via a special backend edge pod in each building. \nA BAG inter-building connection for DSF fabric across five data centers.\nBelow is an example of NSF L2 connected to BAG planes. Each BAG plane connects to matching Spine Training Switches (STSWs) from all spine planes. Effective oversubscription is 4.98:1.  \n\nA BAG inter-building connection for NSF fabric.\nCareful management of oversubscription ratios assists in balancing scale and performance. Typical oversubscription from L2 to BAG is around 4.5:1, while BAG-to-BAG oversubscription varies based on regional requirements and link capacity.\nHardware and Routing \nMeta’s implementation of BAG uses a modular chassis equipped with Jericho3 (J3) ASIC line cards, each providing up to 432x800G ports for high-capacity, scalable, and resilient interconnect. The central hub BAG employs a larger chassis to accommodate numerous spokes and long-distance links with varied cable lengths for optimized buffer utilization.\nRouting within BAG uses eBGP with link bandwidth attributes, enabling Unequal Cost Multipath (UCMP) for efficient load balancing and robust failure handling. BAG-to-BAG connections are secured with MACsec, aligning with network security requirements.\nDesigning the Network for Resilience\nThe network design meticulously details port striping, IP addressing schemes, and comprehensive failure domain analysis to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of failures. Failure modes are analyzed at the BAG, data hall, and power distribution levels. We also employ various strategies to mitigate blackholing risks, including draining affected BAG planes and conditional route aggregation.\nConsiderations for Long Cable Distances\nAn important advantage of BAG’s distributed architecture is it keeps the distance from the L2 edge small, which is important for shallow buffer NSF switches. Longer, BAG-to-BAG, cable distances dictate that we use deep buffer switches for the BAG role. This provides a large headroom buffer to support lossless congestion control protocols like PFC.  \nBuilding Prometheus and Beyond\nAs a technology, BAG is playing an important role in Meta’s next generation of AI infrastructure. By centralizing the interconnection of regional networks, BAG helps enable the gigawatt-scale Prometheus cluster, ensuring seamless, high-capacity networking across tens of thousands of GPUs. This thoughtful design, leveraging modular hardware and resilient topologies, positions BAG to not only meet the demands of Prometheus but also to drive the future innovation and scalability of Meta’s global AI network for years to come.\nThe post Building Prometheus: How Backend Aggregation Enables Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Baolin Li, Lingyi Liu, Binh Tang, Shaojing Li\nIntroduction\nPre-training gives Large Language Models (LLMs) broad linguistic ability and general world knowledge, but post-training is the phase that actually aligns them to concrete intents, domain constraints, and the reliability requirements of production environments. At Netflix, we are exploring how LLMs can enable new member experiences across recommendation, personalization, and search, which requires adapting generic foundation models so they can better reflect our catalog and the nuances of member interaction histories. At Netflix scale, post-training quickly becomes an engineering problem as much as a modeling one: building and operating complex data pipelines, coordinating distributed state across multi-node GPU clusters, and orchestrating workflows that interleave training and inference. This blog describes the architecture and engineering philosophy of our internal Post-Training Framework, built by the AI Platform team to hide infrastructure complexity so researchers and model developers can focus on model innovation — not distributed systems plumbing.\nA Model Developer’s Post-Training Journey\nPost-training often starts deceptively simply: curate proprietary domain data, load an open-weight model from Hugging Face, and iterate batches through it. At the experimentation scale, that’s a few lines of code. But when fine-tuning production-grade LLMs at scale, the gap between “running a script” and “robust post-training” becomes an abyss of engineering edge cases.\nFigure 1. Simple steps to post-train an open-weight model.\nGetting the data right\nOn paper, post-training is straightforward: choose a tokenizer, preprocess the dataset, and build a dataloader. In practice, data preparation is where things break. High-quality post-training — instruction following, multi-turn dialogue, Chain-of-Thought — depends on precisely controlling which tokens contribute to the loss. Hugging Face chat templates serialize conversations, but don’t specify what to train on versus ignore. The pipeline must apply explicit loss masking so only assistant tokens are optimized; otherwise the model learns from prompts and other non-target text, degrading quality.\nVariable sequence length is another pitfall. Padding within a batch can waste compute, and uneven shapes across FSDP workers can cause GPU synchronization overhead. A more GPU-efficient approach is to pack multiple samples into fixed-length sequences and use a “document mask” to prevent cross-attention across samples, reducing padding and keeping shapes consistent.\nSetting up the model\nLoading an open-source checkpoint sounds simple until the model no longer fits on one GPU. At that point you need a sharding strategy (e.g., FSDP, TP) and must load partial weights directly onto the device mesh to avoid ever materializing the full model on a single device.\nAfter loading, you still need to make the model trainable: choose full fine-tuning vs. LoRA, and apply optimizations like activation checkpointing, compilation, and correct precision settings (often subtle for RL, where rollout and policy precision must align). Large vocabularies (>128k) add a further memory trap: logits are [batch, seq_len, vocab] and can spike peak memory. Common mitigations include dropping ignored tokens before projection and computing logits/loss in chunks along the sequence dimension.\nStarting the training\nEven with data and models ready, production training is not a simple “for loop”. The system must support everything from SFT’s forward/backward pass to on-policy RL workflows that interleave rollout generation, reward/reference inference, and policy updates.\nAt Netflix scale, training runs as a distributed job. We use Ray to orchestrate workflows via actors, decoupling modeling logic from hardware. Robust runs also require experiment tracking (model quality metrics like loss and efficiency metrics like MFU) and fault tolerance via standardized checkpoints to resume cleanly after failures.\nThese challenges motivate a post-training framework that lets developers focus on modeling rather than distributed systems and operational details.\nThe Netflix Post-Training Framework\nWe built Netflix’s LLM post-training framework so Netflix model developers can turn ideas like those in Figure 1 into scalable, robust training jobs. It addresses the engineering hurdles described above, and also constraints that are specific to the Netflix ecosystem. Existing tools (e.g., Thinking Machines’ Tinker) work well for standard chat and instruction-tuning, but their structure can limit deeper experimentation. In contrast, our internal use cases often require architectural variation (for example, customizing output projection heads for task-specific objectives), expanded or nonstandard vocabularies driven by semantic IDs or special tokens, and even transformer models pre-trained from scratch on domain-specific, non-natural-language sequences. Supporting this range requires a framework that prioritizes flexibility and extensibility over a fixed fine-tuning paradigm.\nFigure 2. The post-training library within Netflix stack\nFigure 2 shows the end-to-end stack from infrastructure to trained models. At the base is Mako, Netflix’s internal ML compute platform, which provisions GPUs on AWS. On top of Mako, we run robust open-source components — PyTorch, Ray, and vLLM — largely out of the box. Our post-training framework sits above these foundations as a library: it provides reusable utilities and standardized training recipes for common workflows such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Knowledge Distillation. Users typically express jobs as configuration files that select a recipe and plug in task-specific components.\nFigure 3. Main components developed for the post-training framework\nFigure 3 summarizes the modular components we built to reduce complexity across four dimensions. As with most ML systems, training success hinges on three pillars — Data, Model, and Compute — and the rise of RL fine-tuning adds a fourth pillar: Workflow, to support multi-stage execution patterns that don’t fit a simple training loop. Below, we detail the specific abstractions and features the framework provides for each of these dimensions:\n\nData: Dataset abstractions for SFT, reward modeling, and RL; high-throughput streaming from cloud and disk for datasets that exceed local storage; and asynchronous, on-the-fly sequence packing to overlap CPU-heavy packing with GPU execution and reduce idle time.\nModel: Support for modern architectures (e.g., Qwen3, Gemma3) and Mixture-of-Experts variants (e.g., Qwen3 MoE, GPT-OSS); LoRA integrated into model definitions; and high-level sharding APIs so developers can distribute large models across device meshes without writing low-level distributed code.\nCompute: A unified job submission interface that scales from a single node to hundreds of GPUs; MFU (Model FLOPS Utilization) monitoring that remains accurate under custom architectures and LoRA; and comprehensive checkpointing (states of trained parameters, optimizer, dataloader, data mixer, etc.) to enable exact resumption after interruptions.\nWorkflow: Support for training paradigms beyond SFT, including complex online RL. In particular, we extend Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) style SFT workloads to run online RL with a hybrid single-controller + SPMD execution model, which we’ll describe next.\n\nToday, this framework supports research use cases ranging from post-training large-scale foundation models to fine-tuning specialized expert models. By standardizing these workflows, we’ve lowered the barrier for teams to experiment with advanced techniques and iterate more quickly.\nLearnings from Building the Post-Training Framework\nBuilding a system of this scope wasn’t a linear implementation exercise. It meant tracking a fast-moving open-source ecosystem, chasing down failure modes that only appear under distributed load, and repeatedly revisiting architectural decisions as the post-training frontier shifted. Below are three engineering learnings and best practices that shaped the framework.\nScaling from SFT to RL\nWe initially designed the library around Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): relatively static data flow, a single training loop, and a Single Program, Multiple Data (SPMD) execution model. That assumption stopped holding in 2025. With DeepSeek-R1 and the broader adoption of efficient on-policy RL methods like GRPO, SFT became table stakes rather than the finish line. Staying close to the frontier required infrastructure that could move from “offline training loop” to “multi-stage, on-policy orchestration.”\nSFT’s learning signal is dense and immediate: for each token position we compute logits over the full vocabulary and backpropagate a differentiable loss. Infrastructure-wise, this looks a lot like pre-training and maps cleanly to SPMD — every GPU worker runs the same step function over a different shard of data, synchronizing through Pytorch distributed primitives.\nOn-policy RL changes the shape of the system. The learning signal is typically sparse and delayed (e.g., a scalar reward at the end of an episode), and the training step depends on data generated by the current policy. Individual sub-stages — policy updates, rollout generation, reference model inference, reward model scoring — can each be implemented as SPMD workloads, but the end-to-end algorithm needs explicit coordination: you’re constantly handing off artifacts (prompts, sampled trajectories, rewards, advantages) across stages and synchronizing their lifecycle.\nIn our original SFT architecture, the driver node was intentionally “thin”: it launched N identical Ray actors, each encapsulating the full training loop, and scaling meant launching more identical workers. That model breaks down for RL. RL required us to decompose the system into distinct roles — Policy, Rollout Workers, Reward Model, Reference Model, etc. — and evolve the driver into an active controller that encodes the control plane: when to generate rollouts, how to batch and score them, when to trigger optimization, and how to manage cluster resources across phases.\nFigure 4. Architectural differences of SFT and RL framework\nFigure 4 highlights this shift. To add RL support without reinventing distributed orchestration from scratch, we integrated the core infrastructure from the open-source Verl library to manage Ray actor lifecycle and GPU resource allocation. Leveraging Verl’s backend let us focus on the “modeling surface area” — our Data/Model/Compute abstractions and internal optimizations — while keeping orchestration concerns decoupled. The result is a hybrid design: a unified user interface where developers can move between SFT and RL workflows without adopting an entirely different mental model or API set.\nHugging Face-Centric Experience\nThe Hugging Face Hub has effectively become the default distribution channel for open-weight LLMs, tokenizers, and configs. We designed the framework to stay close to that ecosystem rather than creating an isolated internal standard. Even when we use optimized internal model representations for speed, we load and save checkpoints in standard Hugging Face formats. This avoids “walled garden” friction and lets teams pull in new architectures, weights, and tokenizers quickly.\nThis philosophy also shaped our tokenizer story. Early on, we bound directly to low-level tokenization libraries (e.g., SentencePiece, tiktoken) to maximize control. In practice, that created a costly failure mode: silent training–serving skew. Our inference stack (vLLM) defaults to Hugging Face AutoTokenizer, and tiny differences in normalization, special token handling, or chat templating can yield different token boundaries — exactly the kind of mismatch that shows up later as inexplicable quality regressions. We fixed this by making Hugging Face AutoTokenizer the single source of truth. We then built a thin compatibility layer (BaseHFModelTokenizer) to handle post-training needs — setting padding tokens, injecting generation markers to support loss masking, and managing special tokens / semantic IDs — while ensuring the byte-level tokenization path matches production.\nWe do take a different approach for model implementations. Rather than training directly on transformers model classes, we maintain our own optimized, unified model definitions that can still load/save Hugging Face checkpoints. This layer is what enables framework-level optimizations — e.g., FlexAttention, memory-efficient chunked cross-entropy, consistent MFU accounting, and uniform LoRA extensibility — without re-implementing them separately for every model family. A unified module naming convention also makes it feasible to programmatically locate and swap components (Attention, MLP, output heads) across architectures, and provides a consistent surface for Tensor Parallelism and FSDP wrapping policies.\nThe trade-off is clear: supporting a new model family requires building a bridge between the Hugging Face reference implementation and our internal definition. To reduce that overhead, we use AI coding agents to automate much of the conversion work, with a strict logit verifier as the gate: given random inputs, our internal model must match the Hugging Face logits within tolerance. Because the acceptance criterion is mechanically checkable, agents can iterate autonomously until the implementation is correct, dramatically shortening the time-to-support for new architectures.\nToday, this design means we can only train architectures we explicitly support — an intentional constraint shared by other high-performance systems like vLLM, SGLang, and torchtitan. To broaden coverage, we plan to add a fallback Hugging Face backend, similar to the compatibility patterns these projects use: users will be able to run training directly on native transformers models for rapid exploration of novel architectures, with the understanding that some framework optimizations and features may not apply in that mode.\nProviding Differential Value\nA post-training framework is only worth owning if it delivers clear value beyond assembling OSS components. We build on open source for velocity, but we invest heavily where off-the-shelf tools tend to be weakest: performance tuned to our workload characteristics, and integration with Netflix-specific model and business requirements. Here are some concrete examples:\nFirst, we optimize training efficiency for our real use cases. A representative example is extreme variance in sequence length. In FSDP-style training, long-tail sequences create stragglers: faster workers end up waiting at synchronization points for the slowest batch, lowering utilization. Standard bin-packing approaches help, but doing them offline at our data scale can add substantial preprocessing latency and make it harder to keep datasets fresh. Instead, we built on-the-fly sequence packing that streams samples from storage and dynamically packs them in memory. Packing runs asynchronously, overlapping CPU work with GPU compute. Figure 5 shows the impact: for our most skewed dataset, on-the-fly packing improved the effective token throughput by up to 4.7x.\nFigure 5. Training throughput on two of our internal datasets on A100 and H200 GPUs\nWe also encountered subtler performance cliffs around vocabulary expansion. Our workloads frequently add custom tokens and semantic IDs. We found that certain vocabulary sizes could cause the language model head to fall back from a highly optimized cuBLAS kernel to a much slower CUTLASS path, tripling that layer’s execution time. The framework now automatically pads vocabulary sizes to multiples of 64 so the compiler selects the fast kernel, preserving throughput without requiring developers to know these low-level constraints.\nSecond, owning the framework lets us support “non-standard” transformer use cases that generic LLM tooling rarely targets. For example, some internal models are trained on member interaction event sequences rather than natural language, and may require bespoke RL loops that integrate with highly-customized inference engines and optimize business-defined metrics. These workflows demand custom environments, reward computation, and orchestration patterns — while still needing the same underlying guarantees around performance, tracking, and fault tolerance. The framework is built to accommodate these specialized requirements without fragmenting into one-off pipelines, enabling rapid iteration.\nWrap up\nBuilding the Netflix Post-Training Framework has been a continual exercise in balancing standardization with specialization. By staying anchored to the open-source ecosystem, we’ve avoided drifting into a proprietary stack that diverges from where the community is moving. At the same time, by owning the core abstractions around Data, Model, Compute, and Workflow, we’ve preserved the freedom to optimize for Netflix-scale training and Netflix-specific requirements.\nIn the process, we’ve moved post-training from a loose collection of scripts into a managed, scalable system. Whether the goal is maximizing SFT throughput, orchestrating multi-stage on-policy RL, or training transformers over member interaction sequences, the framework provides a consistent set of primitives to do so reliably and efficiently. As the field shifts toward more agentic, reasoning-heavy, and multimodal architectures, this foundation will help us translate new ideas into scalable GenAI prototypes — so experimentation is constrained by our imagination, not by operational complexity.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work builds on the momentum of the broader open-source ML community. We’re especially grateful to the teams and contributors behind Torchtune, Torchtitan, and Verl, whose reference implementations and design patterns informed many of our training framework choices — particularly around scalable training recipes, distributed execution, and RL-oriented orchestration. We also thank our partner teams in Netflix AI for Member Systems for close collaboration, feedback, and shared problem-solving throughout the development and rollout of the Post-Training Framework, and the Training Platform team for providing the robust infrastructure and operational foundation that makes large-scale post-training possible.\n\nScaling LLM Post-Training at Netflix was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

Internal evaluations revealed that Aurora PostgreSQL had supported over 95% of the applications and workloads running on other relational databases across our internal services.\nIndustry momentum had continued to shift toward PostgreSQL, driven by its open ecosystem, strong community support, and broad adoption across modern data platforms.\nAurora’s cloud-native, distributed architecture provided clear advantages in scalability, high availability, and elasticity compared to traditional single-node PostgreSQL deployments.\nAurora PostgreSQL offered a rich feature set, along with a strong, forward-looking roadmap aligned with the needs of large-scale, globally distributed applications.\n\nA Clear Migration Path Forward\nAs part of this strategic shift, one of our key initiatives for 2024/2025 was migrating existing users to Aurora PostgreSQL. This effort began with RDS PostgreSQL migrations and will expand to include migrations from other relational systems in subsequent phases.\nAs a data platform organization, our goal is to make this evolution predictable, well-supported, and minimally disruptive. This allows teams to adopt Aurora PostgreSQL at a pace that aligns with their product and operational roadmaps, while we move toward a unified and scalable relational data platform across the organization.\nDatabase Migration: More Than a Simple Transfer\nMigrating a database involves far more than copying rows from one system to another. It is a coordinated process of transitioning both data and database functionality while preserving correctness, availability, and performance. At scale, a well-designed migration must minimize disruption to applications and ensure a clean, deterministic handoff from the old system to the new one.\nMost database migrations follow a common set of high-level steps:\n\nData Replication: Data is first copied from the source database to the destination, typically using replication, so that ongoing changes are continuously captured and applied.\nQuiescence: Write traffic to the source database is halted, allowing the destination to fully catch up and eliminate any remaining divergence.\nValidation: The system verifies that the source and destination databases are fully synchronized and contain identical data.\nCutover: Client applications are reconfigured to point to the destination database, which becomes the new primary source of truth.\n\nChallenges\nOperational Challenges\nMigrating to a new relational database at Netflix scale presents substantial operational challenges. With a fleet approaching 400 PostgreSQL clusters, manually migrating each one is simply not scalable for the data platform team. Such an approach would require a significant amount of time, introduce the risk of human error, and necessitate considerable hands-on engineering effort. Compounding the problem, coordinating downtime across the many interconnected services that depend on each database is extremely cumbersome at this scale.\nTo address these challenges, we designed a self-service migration workflow that enables service owners to run their own RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL migrations. The workflow automatically handles orchestration, safety checks, and correctness guarantees end-to-end, resulting in lower operational overhead and a predictable, reliable migration experience.\nTechnical challenges\n\nZero data loss — We must guarantee that all data from the source cluster is fully and safely migrated to the destination within a very tight window, with no possibility of data loss.\nMinimal downtime — Some downtime is unavoidable during migration, as applications must briefly pause write traffic while cutting over to Aurora PostgreSQL. For higher-tier services that power critical parts of the Netflix ecosystem, this window must be kept extremely short to prevent user-facing impact and maintain service reliability.\nNo control over client applications — As the platform team, we manage the databases, but application teams handle the read and write operations. We cannot assume that they have the ability to pause writes on demand, nor do we want to expose such controls to them, as mistakes could lead to data inconsistencies post migration. Therefore, building a self-service migration pipeline requires creative control-plane solutions to halt traffic, ensuring that no writes occur during the validation and cutover phases.\nNo direct access to RDS credentials — The migration automation must perform replication, quiescence, and validation without requesting database credentials from users or relying on manual authentication. Source databases are often tightly secured, allowing access only from client applications, but more importantly, requiring credential access — even if it were possible — would significantly increase operational overhead and risk. At the same time, the migration platform may operate in environments without direct access to the source database, making traditional verification or parity checks impossible.\nNo Degradation in Performance — The migration process must not impact the performance or stability of production databases once they are running in the Aurora PostgreSQL ecosystem.\nFull Ecosystem Parity — Beyond migrating the core database, associated components such as parameter groups, read replicas, and replication slots must also be migrated to ensure functional equivalence.\n\nMinimal User Effort — Since we rely on teams who are not database experts to perform migrations, the process must be simple, intuitive, and fully self-guided.\nAWS recommended migration techniques\nUsing a snapshot\nOne of the simplest AWS-recommended approaches for migrating from RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL is based on snapshots. In this model, write traffic to the source PostgreSQL database is first stopped. A manual snapshot of the RDS PostgreSQL instance is then taken and migrated to Aurora, where AWS converts it into an Aurora-compatible format.\n Once the conversion completes, a new Aurora PostgreSQL cluster is created from the snapshot. After the cluster is brought online and validated, application traffic is redirected to the Aurora endpoint, completing the migration.\nReference\nUsing an Aurora read replica\nIn the read-replica–based approach, an Aurora PostgreSQL read replica is created from an existing RDS PostgreSQL instance. AWS establishes continuous, asynchronous replication from the RDS source to the Aurora replica, allowing ongoing changes to be streamed in near real time.\nBecause replication runs continuously, the Aurora replica remains closely synchronized with the source database. This enables teams to provision and validate the Aurora environment — including configuration, connectivity, and performance characteristics — while production traffic continues to flow to the source.\nWhen the replication lag is sufficiently low, write traffic is briefly paused to allow the replica to fully catch up. The Aurora read replica is then promoted to a standalone Aurora PostgreSQL cluster, and application traffic is redirected to the new Aurora endpoint. This approach significantly reduces downtime compared to snapshot-based migrations and is well-suited for production systems that require minimal disruption.\nMigration Strategy Trade-Offs\nThese differences represent the key considerations when choosing a migration strategy from RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL. For our automation, we opted for the Aurora Read Replica approach, trading increased implementation complexity for a significantly shorter downtime window for client applications.\nNetflix RDS PostgreSQL Deployment Architecture\nIn Netflix’s RDS setup, a Data Access Layer (DAL) sits between applications and backend databases, acting as middleware that centralizes database connectivity, security, and traffic routing on behalf of client applications.\nOn the client side, applications connect through a forward proxy that manages mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication and establishes a secure tunnel to the Data Gateway service. The Data Gateway, acting as a reverse proxy for database servers, terminates client connections, enforces centralized authentication and authorization, and forwards traffic to the appropriate RDS PostgreSQL instance.\nThis layered design ensures that applications never handle raw database credentials, provides a consistent and secure access pattern across all datastore types, and delivers isolated, transparent connectivity to managed PostgreSQL clusters. While the primary goal of this architecture is to enforce strong security controls and standardize how applications access external AWS data stores, it also allows backend databases to be switched transparently via configuration, enabling controlled, low-downtime migrations.\nMigration Process\nThe Platform team’s goal is to deliver a fully automated, self-service workflow that helps with the migration of customer RDS PostgreSQL instances to Aurora PostgreSQL clusters. This migration tool orchestrates the entire process — from preparing the source environment, initializing the Aurora read replica, and maintaining continuous synchronization, all the way through to cutover — without requiring any database credentials or manual intervention from the customer.\nDesigned for minimal downtime and seamless user experience, the workflow ensures full ecosystem parity between RDS and Aurora, preserving performance characteristics and operational behavior while enabling customers to benefit from Aurora’s improved scalability, resilience, and cost efficiency.\nData Replication Phase\nEnable Automated Backups\nAutomated backups must be enabled on the source database because the Aurora read replica is initialized from a consistent snapshot of the source and then kept in sync through continuous replication. Automated backups provide the stable snapshot required to bootstrap the replica, along with the continuous streaming of write-ahead log (WAL) records needed to keep the read replica closely synchronized with the source.\nPort RDS parameters to an Aurora parameter group\nWe create a dedicated Aurora parameter group for each cluster and migrate all RDS-compatible parameters from the source RDS instance. This ensures that the Aurora cluster inherits the same configuration settings — such as memory configuration, connection limits, query planner behavior, and other PostgreSQL engine parameters that have equivalents in Aurora. Parameters that are unsupported or behave differently in Aurora are either omitted or adjusted according to Aurora best practices.\nCreate an Aurora read replica cluster and instance\nCreating an Aurora read replica cluster is a critical step in migrating from RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL. At this stage, the Aurora cluster is created and attached to the RDS PostgreSQL primary as a replica, establishing continuous replication from the source RDS PostgreSQL instance. These Aurora read replicas stay nearly in sync with ongoing changes by streaming write-ahead logs (WAL) from the source, enabling minimal downtime during cutover. The cluster is fully operational for validation and performance testing, but it is not yet writable — RDS remains the authoritative primary.\n\nQuiescence Phase\nThe goal of the quiescence phase is to transition client applications from the source RDS PostgreSQL instance to the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster as the new primary database, while preserving data consistency during cutover.\nThe first step in this process is to stop all write traffic to the source RDS PostgreSQL instance to guarantee consistency. To achieve this, we instruct users to halt application-level traffic, which helps prevent issues such as retry storms, queue backlogs, or unnecessary resource consumption when connectivity changes during cutover. This coordination also gives teams time to prepare operationally, for example, by suppressing alerts, notifying downstream consumers, or communicating planned maintenance to their customers.\nHowever, relying solely on application-side controls is unreliable. Operational gaps, misconfigurations, or lingering connections can still modify the source database state, potentially resulting in changes that are not replicated to the destination and leading to data inconsistency or loss. To enforce a clean and deterministic cutover, we also block traffic at the infrastructure layer. This is done by detaching the RDS instance’s security groups to prevent new inbound connections, followed by a reboot of the instance. With security groups removed, no new SQL sessions can be established, and the reboot forcibly terminates any existing connections.\nThis approach intentionally avoids requiring database credentials or logging into the PostgreSQL server to manually terminate connections. While it may be slower than application- or database-level intervention, it provides a reliably automated and repeatable mechanism to fully quiesce the source RDS PostgreSQL instance before Aurora promotion, eliminating the risk of divergent writes or an inconsistent WAL state.\nValidation Phase\nTo determine whether the Aurora read replica has fully caught up with the source RDS PostgreSQL instance, we track replication progress using Aurora’s OldestReplicationSlotLag metric. This metric represents how far the Aurora replica is behind the source in applying write-ahead log (WAL) records.\nOnce client traffic is halted during quiescence, the source RDS PostgreSQL instance stops producing meaningful WAL entries. At that point, the replication lag should converge to zero, indicating that all WAL records corresponding to real writes have been fully replayed on Aurora.\nHowever, in practice, our experiments show that the metric never settles at a steady zero. Instead, it briefly drops to 0, then quickly returns to 64 MB, repeating this pattern every few minutes as shown in the figure below.\nOldestReplicationSlotLag\nThis behavior stems from how OldestReplicationSlotLag is calculated. Internally, the lag is derived using the following query:\nSELECT\n  slot_name,\n  pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_current_wal_lsn(), restart_lsn) AS slot_lag_bytes\nFROM pg_replication_slots;\nConceptually, this translates to:\nOldestReplicationSlotLag = current_WAL_position_on_RDS \n                           – restart_lsn \nSee AWS references here and here.\nThe restart_lsn represents the oldest write-ahead log (WAL) record that PostgreSQL must retain to ensure a replication consumer can safely resume replication.\nWhen PostgreSQL performs a WAL segment switch, Aurora typically catches up almost immediately. At that moment, the restart_lsn briefly matches the source’s current WAL position, causing the reported lag to drop to 0. During idle periods, PostgreSQL performs an empty WAL segment rotation approximately every five minutes, driven by the archive_timeout = 300s setting in the database parameter group.\nImmediately afterward, PostgreSQL begins writing to the new WAL segment. Since this new segment has not yet been fully flushed or consumed by Aurora, the WAL position in source RDS PostgreSQL advances ahead of the restart_lsn of Aurora PostgreSQL by exactly one segment. As a result, OldestReplicationSlotLag jumps to 64 MB, which corresponds to the configured WAL segment size at database initialization, and remains there until the next segment switch occurs.\nBecause idle PostgreSQL performs an empty WAL rotation approximately every five minutes, this zero-then-64 MB oscillation is expected. Importantly, the moment when the lag drops to 0 indicates that all meaningful WAL records have been fully replicated, and the Aurora read replica is fully caught up with the source.\nCutover Phase\nOnce the Aurora read replica has fully caught up with the source RDS PostgreSQL instance — as confirmed through replication lag analysis — the final step is to promote the replica and redirect application traffic. Promoting the Aurora read replica converts it into an independent, writable Aurora PostgreSQL cluster with its own writer and reader endpoints. At this point, the source RDS PostgreSQL instance is no longer the authoritative primary and is made inaccessible.\nBecause Netflix’s RDS ecosystem is fronted by a Data Access Layer (DAL), consisting of client-side forward proxies and a centralized Data Gateway, switching databases does not require application code changes or database credential access. Instead, traffic redirection is handled entirely through configuration updates in the reverse-proxy layer. Specifically, we update the runtime configuration of the Envoy-based Data Gateway to route traffic to the newly promoted Aurora cluster. Once this configuration change propagates, all client-initiated database connections are transparently routed through the DAL to the Aurora writer endpoint, completing the migration without requiring any application changes.\nThis proxy-level cutover, combined with Aurora promotion, enables a seamless transition for service owners, minimizes downtime, and preserves data consistency throughout the migration process.\nCustomer Experience: Migrating a Business-Critical Partner Platform\nOne of the critical teams to adopt the RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL migration workflow was the Enablement Applications team. This team owns a set of databases that model Netflix’s entire ecosystem of partner integrations, including device manufacturers, discovery platforms, and distribution partners. These databases power a suite of enterprise applications that partners worldwide rely on to build, test, certify, and launch Netflix experiences on their devices and services.\nBecause these databases sit at the center of Netflix’s partner enablement and certification workflows, they are consumed by a diverse set of client applications across both internal and external organizations. Internally, reliability teams use this data to identify streaming failures for specific devices and configurations, supporting quality improvements across the device ecosystem. At the same time, these databases directly serve external partners operating across many regions. Device manufacturers rely on them to configure, test, and certify new hardware, while payment partners use them to set up and launch bundled offerings with Netflix.\nSimplified Enablement Applications Overview\nDevice Lifecycle Management\nNetflix works with a wide range of device partners to ensure Netflix streams seamlessly across a diverse ecosystem of consumer devices. A core responsibility of Device Lifecycle Management is to provide tools and workflows that allow partners to develop, test, and certify Netflix integrations on their devices.\nAs part of the device lifecycle, partners run Netflix-provided test suites against their NRDP implementation. We store signals that represent the current stage for each device in the certification process. This certification data forms the backbone of Netflix’s device enablement program, ensuring that only validated devices can launch Netflix experiences.\nPartner Billed Integrations\nIn addition to device enablement, the same partner metadata is also consumed by Netflix’s Partner Billed Integrations organization. This group enables external partners to offer Netflix as part of bundled subscription and billing experiences.\nAny disruption in these databases affects partner integration workflows. If the database is unavailable, partners may be unable to configure or launch service bundles with Netflix. Maintaining high availability and data correctness is essential to preserving smooth integration operations.\nThe global nature of these workflows makes it difficult to schedule downtime windows. Any disruption would impact partner productivity and risk eroding trust in Netflix’s integration and certification processes.\nPreparation\nGiven the criticality of the Enablement Applications databases, thorough preparation was essential before initiating the migration. The team invested significant effort upfront to understand traffic patterns, identify all consumers, and establish clear communication channels.\nUnderstand Client Fan-Out and Traffic Patterns\nThe first step was to gain a complete view of how the databases were being used in production. Using observability tools like CloudWatch metrics, the team analyzed PostgreSQL connection counts, read and write patterns, and overall load characteristics. This helped establish a baseline for normal behavior and ensured there were no unexpected traffic spikes or hidden dependencies that could complicate the migration.\nJust as importantly, this baseline gave the Enablement Applications team a rough idea of the post-migration behavior on Aurora. For example, they expected to see a similar number of active database connections and comparable traffic patterns after cutover, making it easier to validate that the migration had preserved operational characteristics.\nIdentify and Enumerate All Database Consumers\nUnlike most databases, where the set of consumers is well known to the owning team, these databases were accessed by a wide range of internal services and external-facing systems that were not fully enumerated upfront. To address this, we leveraged a tool called flowlogs, an eBPF-based network attribution tooling was used to capture TCP flow data to identify the services and applications establishing connections to the database(link).\n This approach allowed the team to enumerate active consumers, including those that were not previously documented, ensuring no clients were missed during migration planning.\nEstablish Dedicated Communication Channels\nOnce all consumers were identified, a dedicated communication channel was created to provide continuous updates throughout the migration process. This channel was used to share timelines, readiness checks, status updates, and cutover notifications, ensuring that all stakeholders remained aligned and could respond quickly if issues arose.\nMigration Process\nAfter completing application-side preparation, the Enablement Applications team initiated the data replication phase of the migration workflow. The automation successfully provisioned the Aurora read replica cluster and ported the RDS PostgreSQL parameter group to a corresponding Aurora parameter group, bringing the destination environment up with equivalent configuration.\nUnexpected Replication Slot Behavior\nHowever, shortly after replication began, we observed that the OldestReplicationSlotLag metric was unexpectedly high. This was counterintuitive, as Aurora read replicas are designed to remain closely synchronized with the source database by continuously streaming write-ahead logs (WAL).\nFurther investigation revealed the presence of an inactive logical replication slot on the source RDS PostgreSQL instance. An inactive replication slot can cause elevated OldestReplicationSlotLag because PostgreSQL must retain all WAL records required by the slot’s last known position (restart_lsn), even if no client is actively consuming data from it. Replication slots are intentionally designed to prevent data loss by ensuring that a consumer can resume replication from where it left off. As a result, PostgreSQL will not recycle or delete WAL segments needed by a replication slot until the slot advances. When a slot becomes inactive — such as when a client migration task is stopped or abandoned — the slot’s position no longer moves forward. Meanwhile, the database continues to generate WAL, forcing PostgreSQL to retain increasingly older WAL files. This growing gap between the current WAL position and the slot’s restart_lsn manifests as a high OldestReplicationSlotLag.\nIdentifying and addressing these inactive replication slots was a critical prerequisite to proceeding safely with the migration and ensuring accurate replication state during cutover.\nSuccessful Migration After Remediation\n After identifying the inactive logical replication slot, the team safely cleaned it up on the source RDS PostgreSQL instance and resumed the migration workflow. With the stale slot removed, replication progressed as expected, and the Aurora read replica quickly converged with the source. The migration then proceeded smoothly through the quiescence phase, with no unexpected behavior or replication anomalies observed.\nFollowing promotion, application traffic transitioned seamlessly to the newly writable Aurora PostgreSQL cluster. Through the Data Access Layer, new client connections were automatically routed to Aurora, and observability metrics confirmed healthy behavior — connection counts, read/write patterns, and overall load closely matched pre-migration baselines. From the application and partner perspective, the cutover was transparent, validating both the correctness of the migration workflow and the effectiveness of the preparation steps.\nOpen questions\nHow do we select target Aurora PostgreSQL instance types based on the existing production RDS PostgreSQL instance?\nWhen selecting the target Aurora PostgreSQL instance type for a production migration, our guidance is intentionally conservative. We prioritize stability and performance first, and optimize for cost only after observing real workload behavior on Aurora.\nIn practice, the recommended approach is to adopt Graviton2-based instances (particularly the r6g family) whenever possible, maintain the same instance family and size where feasible, and — at minimum — preserve the memory footprint of the existing RDS instance.\nUnlike RDS PostgreSQL, Aurora does not support the m-series, making a direct family match impossible for those instances. In such cases, simply keeping the same “size” (e.g., 2xlarge → 2xlarge) is not meaningful because the memory profiles differ across families. Instead, we map instances by memory equivalence. For example, an Aurora r6g.xlarge provides a memory footprint comparable to an RDS m5.2xlarge, making it a practical replacement. This memory-aligned strategy offers a safer and more predictable baseline for production migrations.\nDowntime During RDS → Aurora Cutover?\nTo achieve minimal downtime during an RDS PostgreSQL → Aurora PostgreSQL migration, we front-load as much work as possible into the preparation phase. By the time we reach cutover, the Aurora read replica is already provisioned and continuously replicating WAL from the source RDS instance. Before initiating downtime, we ensure that the replication lag between Aurora and RDS has stabilized within an acceptable threshold. If the lag is large or fluctuating significantly, forcing a cutover will only inflate downtime.\nDowntime begins the moment we remove the security groups from the source RDS instance, blocking all inbound traffic. We then reboot the instance to forcibly terminate existing connections, which typically takes up to a minute. From this point forward, no writes can be performed.\nAfter traffic is halted, the next objective is to verify that Aurora has fully replayed all meaningful WAL records from RDS. We track this using OldestReplicationSlotLag. We first wait for the metric to drop to 0, indicating that Aurora has consumed all WAL with real writes. Under normal idle behavior, PostgreSQL triggers an empty WAL switch every five minutes. After observing one data point at 0, we wait for an additional idle WAL rotation and confirm that the lag oscillates within the expected 0 → 64 MB pattern — signifying that the only remaining WAL segments are empty ones produced during idle time. At this point, we know the Aurora replica is fully caught up and can be safely promoted.\nWhile these validation steps run, we perform the configuration updates on the Envoy reverse proxy in parallel. Once promotion completes and Envoy is restarted with the new runtime configuration, all client-initiated connections begin routing to the Aurora cluster. In practice, the total write-downtime observed across services averages around 10 minutes, dominated largely by the RDS reboot and the idle WAL switch interval.\nOptimization: Reducing Idle-Time Wait\nFor services requiring stricter downtime budgets, waiting the full five minutes for an idle WAL switch can be prohibitively expensive. In such cases, we can force a WAL rotation immediately after traffic is cut off by issuing:\nSELECT pg_switch_wal();\nOnce the switch occurs, OldestReplicationSlotLag will drop to 0 again as Aurora consumes the new (empty) WAL segment. This approach eliminates the need to wait for the default archive_timeout interval, which can significantly reduce overall downtime.\nHow do we migrate CDC consumers?\nAs part of the data platform organization in Netflix, we provide a managed Change Data Capture (CDC) service across a variety of datastores. For PostgreSQL, logical replication slots is the way of implementing change data capture. At Netflix, we build a managed abstraction on top of these replication slots called datamesh to manage customers who are leveraging them (link).\nEach logical replication slot tracks a consumer’s position in the write-ahead log (WAL), ensuring that WAL records are retained until the consumer has successfully processed them. This guarantees ordered and reliable delivery of row-level changes to downstream systems. At the same time, it tightly couples the lifecycle of replication slots to database operations, making their management a critical consideration during database migrations.\nA key challenge in migrating from RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL is transitioning these CDC consumers safely — without data loss, stalled replication, or extended downtime — while ensuring that replication slots are correctly managed throughout the cutover process.\nEach row-level change in PostgreSQL is emitted as a CDC event with an operation type of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or REFRESH. REFRESH events are generated during backfills by querying the database directly and emitting the current state of rows in chunks. Downstream consumers are designed to be idempotent and eventually consistent, allowing them to safely process retries, replays, and backfills.\nHandling Replication Slots During Migration\nBefore initiating database cutover, we temporarily pause CDC consumption by stopping the infrastructure responsible for consuming from PostgreSQL replication slots and writing into datamesh source. This also drops the replication slot from the database and cleans up our internal state around replication slot offsets. This essentially resets the state of the connector to one of a brand new one.\nThis step is critical for two reasons. First, it prevents replication slots from blocking WAL recycling during migration. Second, it ensures that no CDC consumers are left pointing at the source database once traffic is quiesced and cutover begins. While CDC consumers are paused, downstream systems temporarily stop receiving new change events, but remain stable. Once CDC consumers are paused, we proceed with stopping other client traffic and executing the RDS-to-Aurora cutover.\nReinitializing CDC After Cutover\nAfter the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster has been promoted and traffic has been redirected, CDC consumers are reconfigured to point to the Aurora endpoint and restarted. Because their previous state was intentionally cleared, consumers initialize as if they are starting fresh.\nOn startup, new logical replication slots are created on Aurora, and a full backfill is performed by querying the database and emitting REFRESH events for all existing rows. These events let the consumer know that a manual refresh was done from Aurora and to treat this as an upsert operation. This establishes a clean and consistent baseline from which ongoing CDC can resume. Consumers are expected to handle these refresh events correctly as part of normal operation.\nBy explicitly managing PostgreSQL replication slots as part of the migration workflow, we are able to migrate CDC consumers safely and predictably, without leaving behind stalled slots, retained WAL, or consumers pointing to the wrong database. This approach allows CDC pipelines to be cleanly re-established on Aurora while preserving correctness and operational simplicity.\nHow do we roll back in the middle of the process?\nPre-quiescence\nRolling back before the pre-quienscence phase is quite easy. Your primary RDS database is still the source. Rolling back before the quiescence phase is straightforward. At this stage, the primary RDS PostgreSQL instance continues to serve as the sole source of truth, and no client traffic has been redirected.\nIf a rollback is required, the migration can be safely aborted by deleting the newly created Aurora PostgreSQL cluster along with its associated parameter groups. No changes are needed on the application side, and normal operations on RDS PostgreSQL can continue without impact.\nDuring-quiescence\nRolling back during the quiescence phase is more involved. At this point, client traffic to the source RDS PostgreSQL instance has already been stopped by detaching its security groups. To roll back safely, access must first be restored by reattaching the original security groups to the RDS instance, allowing client connections to resume. In addition, any logical replication slots removed during the migration must be recreated so that CDC consumers can continue processing changes from the source database.\nOnce connectivity and replication slots are restored, the RDS PostgreSQL instance can safely resume its role as the primary source of truth.\nPost-quiescence \nRolling back after cutover, once the Aurora PostgreSQL cluster is serving production traffic, is significantly more complex. At this stage, Aurora has become the primary source of truth, and client applications may already have written new data to it.\nIn this scenario, rollback requires setting up replication in the opposite direction, with Aurora as the source and RDS PostgreSQL as the destination. This can be achieved using a service such as AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). AWS provides detailed guidance for setting up this reverse replication flow, which can be followed to migrate data back to RDS if necessary.\nConclusion\nStandardizing and reducing the surface area of data technologies is crucial for any large-scale platform. For the Netflix platform team, this strategy allows us to concentrate engineering effort, deliver deeper value on a smaller set of well-understood systems, and significantly cut the operational overhead of running multiple database technologies that serve similar purposes. Within the relational database ecosystem, Aurora PostgreSQL has become the paved-path datastore — offering strong scalability, resilience, and consistent operational patterns across the fleet.\nMigrations of this scale demand solutions that are reliable, low-touch, and minimally disruptive for service owners. Our automated RDS PostgreSQL → Aurora PostgreSQL workflow represents a major step forward, providing predictable cutovers, strong correctness guarantees, and a migration experience that works uniformly across diverse workloads.\nAs we continue this journey, the Relational Data Platform team is building higher-level abstractions and capabilities on top of Aurora, enabling service owners to focus less on the complexities of database internals and more on delivering product value. More to come — stay tuned.\nAcknowledgements\nSpecial thanks to our other stunning colleagues/customers who contributed to the success of the RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL migration.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Adeyinka Adegbenro, draft.dev.\nDevelopers know the frustration well. Code works perfectly on their laptop, then breaks the moment it hits staging or production. It’s easy to overlook slight environmental differences that hide latent bugs like race conditions, platform-specific library loading failures, data inconsistencies (large data sets can expose hidden edge cases like timeouts), network variations, flaky tests, and memory issues.\nEven with careful testing, some issues only surface in shared environments. You can’t catch every edge case with local checks alone, and sometimes, pushing unverified changes is unavoidable. That’s why it’s important to catch test failures before code reaches the shared repository. It prevents integration issues and ensures only green commits make it to the shared branch.\nIn this article, you’ll learn how TeamCity’s pretested commits feature stops broken code from reaching your repository. We’ll explain what pretested (gated) commits are and walk through TeamCity’s workflow using remote runs and IDE integration.\nThe problem: Broken builds from unverified commits\nIn software development, unverified commits are common. They speed up individual workflows yet also increase the risk of failed builds.\nTypically, developers run local tests, commit their changes, and push to a shared repository before peer review or validation by the continuous integration server. If there’s an error (especially one caused by differences between local and production environments), it can disrupt the entire team’s workflow.\nTake database connections. Locally, you might connect one service to your DB and stay well within the database’s max connection limits. But in production, several worker processes connect to the same database, quickly hitting the maximum number of connection limits and triggering timeouts.\nWhen these differences go unnoticed, the result is often a cascading chain of failures. Anyone who pulled that branch as their base now has bad code. Other developers who depend on that branch might also have to spend time debugging the code, especially if the original developer who introduced the bug is not available. This is a massive waste of time and resources, and it could have been avoided by enforcing a pretested commit workflow that uses the validation of a powerful CI server like TeamCity.\nOver time, if the main branch is frequently broken, developers become hesitant to pull their latest changes for fear that they could be unstable. This loss of confidence can lead to developers working in isolation and eventually result in multiple merge conflicts, which defeats the whole purpose of using version control as a tool for collaborative development.\nWhat are pretested commits in TeamCity?\nTeamCity’s pretested commits, also known as gated or delayed commits, reverse the build-after-commit workflow. Instead of the typical edit, commit, push, and build flow where you hope that the build passes on the continuous integration platform’s server, it’s flipped. You edit the code and then build the change on the TeamCity servers before committing it.\nThe CI build includes code compilation, tests, linting, and any other predetermined checks defined in your build configuration. If that build fails, the code is not committed, and the developer can fix the issue without affecting the entire team’s process. But if the code build passes the tests, TeamCity or the developer can automatically commit the changes to version control.\n\n\n\n\nThe pretested commit workflow\nThe pretested commit workflow guarantees code quality by running a full build and test cycle before changes hit the main branch. The implementation varies significantly depending on the type of version control system (VCS) being used.\nFor distributed systems like Git, pretested commits are built around feature branches, so there’s no need to apply patches directly to the main branch. This keeps parallel development safe through local, isolated testing and committing. TeamCity can test against a temporary patch of staged changes you made locally, but stops short of performing the final automatic commit to avoid race conditions. Instead, it uses dedicated validation branches through what is known as the branch remote run.\nThe workflow described below is built around Git.\nCreate a project\nOnce you have a TeamCity instance, you need to create a project either manually or by entering the repository URL (e.g., git@github.com:your-org/your-repo.git) of an existing project. If you select the repository option, you’ll be prompted to log in to the version control host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket), and you’ll need to provide the necessary authentication credentials:\n\n\n\n\nConfigure the project\nNext, you’ll need to enter some preliminary settings: the build name, the default branch name, and the branch specifications. For most Git projects, the default branch is either refs/heads/main or refs/heads/master.\nIn the branch specification option, make sure you enter at least one branch, with each branch on a new line. This tells TeamCity which branches to monitor for changes. Here’s a sample branch specification:\n// Default branch\n\nrefs/heads/main\n\n// Regular feature branches\n\nrefs/heads/feature/*\n\n\n\n\nClick Proceed to continue to the build step.\nAdd your build steps\nAfter clicking Proceed, you have to add build steps by clicking the Build Steps tab on your build page. The build steps define the actual sequence of commands required to validate the code. These steps run regardless of the branch type (main or feature/*). A minimal command-line build configuration for a hypothetical Node.js project might look like this:\nset -e\n\nnpm install # Download and install required packages for the project.\n\nnpm run build # Compile source code (e.g., TypeScript, Babel, webpack) into deployable artifacts.\n\nnpm run test # Execute all unit and integration tests. The build will fail if any test fails.\n\nnpm run lint # run linting checks for files\n\n\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your changes and run the build to make sure it works on the default branch.\nPretest validation\nAfter you’ve added build steps, developers need to work on their isolated feature branch locally, making and committing changes frequently (e.g. a branch named feature/login-flow). To initiate the pretest, the developer pushes their local feature branch to the remote repository remote-run/ prefix. TeamCity automatically watches any branches with the prefix remote-run and will run an automatic build once code is pushed there.\n# Pushes feature/login-flow to the remote as remote-run/login-flow\n\ngit push origin feature/login-flow:remote-run/login-flow\n\n\n\n\nIntegration\nOnce the remote-run/login-flow build completes, the status dictates the next step. If it fails, the developer reviews the build log, fixes the issues locally on their feature branch, and repeats the push to the temporary remote-run/login-flow branch.\n\n\n\n\nIf the build is successful, the developer deletes the temporary remote branch. The feature branch (feature/login-flow) is now proven stable and is ready for the final action:\n\n\n\n\nThe developer can now commit and merge with the main branch or create a pull request from their pretested feature branch.\nIn centralized version control systems like SVN or Perforce, TeamCity’s remote run feature allows developers to validate uncommitted local changes using a patch (a bundle of uncommitted changes). A developer uses an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA and the TeamCity plugin to send a patch to the build server, then TeamCity builds and tests the patch. If that’s successful, TeamCity automatically commits the changes to the main repository, completing the pretested commit.\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of using pretested commits\nPretested commits shift the verification from the developer’s machine to the team’s agreed CI environments. Code only gets added to the main branch after passing the specified checks, so failed builds never disrupt other people’s work.\nThis keeps integration clean and catches regressions early. Everyone gets a stable base to branch from. You know the latest version actually works, and you won’t have to spend hours chasing errors introduced by someone else’s build.\nIt also cuts down on frustration. When teams aren’t wasting time fixing someone else’s mistakes, they can focus on their own features. And because you get immediate feedback during pretesting, you catch your own issues before they become someone else’s problem.\nThese benefits add up. Your commit history stays focused on real progress instead of getting cluttered with commit messages like “fixed typo”, “fixed linting issue”, “added missing dependency that caused build failure”, or “added type checks”. Reviewers can focus on meaningful code changes instead of other noise. Your project history tells the story of how the code evolved, not how often it broke.\nUltimately, pretested commits support continuous delivery goals, especially for agile teams that ship frequently and rely on stable releases. Teams can rest easy knowing that their production code has gone through automated, enforced checks.\nVCS and configuration considerations\nTo get pretested commits running smoothly in TeamCity, there are a few version control and configuration details you should pay attention to:\nExtensive VCS integrations: TeamCity supports all major version control platforms. Centralized systems such as Subversion, Perforce, and TFVC can use remote run in the IDE, while distributed systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps) and Mercurial use the branch remote run.\nIDE plugin setup: Using the pretested commit feature within an IDE (remote run) depends on the installation of the TeamCity IDE plugin. The plugin lets you select local, uncommitted changes and send them directly to the TeamCity server for verification.\nBranch specifications: Your build configurations in the TeamCity UI need proper branch specifications (e.g. +:refs/heads/*) so that TeamCity knows which branches to monitor and test automatically.\nParameters and secrets: Define all build parameters (especially secure secrets) at the project or build configuration level in the TeamCity UI. TeamCity will securely insert them during the personal build. This separation ensures the code remains clean of sensitive configuration details. Parameter settings can be found in the project and build settings, after enabling the Settings mode in the upper-right corner of your dashboard.\nMatching repository URLs: If you’re using remote run in the IDE, make sure the repository URL configured in IntelliJ IDEA (or your IDE) matches exactly what is defined in the TeamCity server site. Even small differences (e.g. https://github.com/acct/repo.git vs. https://github.com/acct/repo) can prevent TeamCity from recognizing the patch as belonging to the right VCS root.\nBuild triggers: Triggers let you control when your builds run under the specific circumstances/events that you have configured in the settings. For example, you can skip triggering a build if a certain user commits changes or if a phrase is present in a commit message. Configure this in the Triggers tab of your build settings.\nBuild configuration: Make sure you match your build configuration as close as possible to your branch/commit workflow for consistency. This helps make sure that the logic used to test a developer’s changes is similar to that used for the final merge made to the main branch. For example, if your main branch runs database migrations, your personal build should include the same setup.\nWhen to use pretested commits vs. alternatives\nPretested commits are powerful, but they’re not always the right tool for every project. You need to consider project size, branch stability, and how long your tests take to run before incorporating them in your workflow.\nPretested commits work best for teams with a single stable branch where stability is important. They’re also a good fit when you have solid automated tests, and you’re pushing toward continuous integration and delivery.\nIf your test suites and checks are large, take a long time (i.e. 15 minutes), take up memory, or use production-grade data, running pretested commits remotely frees up developers’ machines and keeps them productive.\nBut if your team relies heavily on feature branches and long-lived branch workflows, pull requests and merge gates may be a better fit. And if your test suite is incomplete or flaky, pretested commits won’t help much; they’re only as good as the tests backing them up.\nCode reviews and staging environments, used along with pretested commits, may be helpful for exploratory testing of the kinks that the flaky test suites cannot cover. Manual commits with quick feedback may be simpler for small teams, solo developers, or teams with tiny codebases.\nIt’s not always a question of choosing one or the other. Pretested commits can be layered on top of existing workflows. For example, a feature branch might have multiple developers contributing. Each developer uses pretested commits to ensure that only passing commits reach the shared feature branch. Once the feature is complete, the team still opens a PR to merge into main (or master). At that stage, the PR process provides an additional layer of code review and CI checks before the final merge.\nConclusion\nPretested commits give teams a way to guarantee that only tested, working code enters the main branch. This shifts the responsibility of integration checks onto the CI server, allowing developers to focus on writing features and trust that the system enforces quality.\nWhile this workflow isn’t the best fit for every team, it can be transformative for environments where stability and continuous delivery are priorities. Keep in mind that a pretested commit workflow is only as good as its tests and checks. If your tests are unreliable, errors can slip through the cracks and cause problems.\nJetBrains TeamCity gives teams everything they need to automatically enforce quality checks, from IDE plugins that let you trigger remote runs directly to flexible branch remote runs.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Working on an existing Go project rarely starts with a plan to modernize it. More often, you open a file to make a small change, add a field, or adjust some logic. The code compiles, tests pass, and everything looks fine, but the language has moved forward, and your code hasn’t kept up.\nAs you bump your project’s Go version, you may start noticing small patterns from older code that stay around for years. A helper variable here. A brittle error check there. You fix them by hand, but as the work spreads across files, you lose context fast.\nIn GoLand, Go 1.26 syntax updates now show up as focused inspections with quick-fixes. You see the change where you are already working, and you can apply the same change throughout the project when you are ready.\nDownload GoLand\n                                                    \nApplying syntax updates\nAs soon as you switch the language version of your project to 1.26, GoLand treats that as a signal: It can now look for patterns that suit Go 1.26 better.\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing you’ll notice is subtle. A blue underline appears under code that is safe to modernize. The underline uses a dedicated severity level named Syntax updates, with a language updates icon (). It is not an error. It is instead an indication that the code can be updated without changing its behavior.\nGoLand adds two Go 1.26 syntax update inspections:\nPointer creation with new()\nType-safe error unwrapping with errors.AsType\nWe started with the latest Go 1.26 changes, and we plan to add more inspections for important language and standard library updates from recent years.\nType-safe error unwrapping with errors.AsType\nGo 1.26 adds errors.AsType, which gives you a typed result. It avoids the pointer setup that errors.As needs and prevents type-mismatch panics. GoLand suggests the safer form and offers the Replace with errors.AsType quick-fix. You can read more about errors.AsType in the GoLand or official documentation.\nBefore\n\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nPointer creation with new()\nGo 1.26 lets new() accept expressions. This removes temporary variables that exist only so you can take their address. GoLand highlights the pattern and offers the Replace with new()  quick-fix. You can read more about new()in the GoLand or official documentation.\nBefore\n\n\n\n\nAfter\n\n\n\n\nExpanding from one fix to the whole project\nOnce you apply the first quick-fix, you can move from a single change to a project-wide update. GoLand gives you several entry points, depending on how you work:\nRight after a quick-fix: Just click Analyze code for other syntax updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Search Everywhere: Open Search Everywhere (press Shift twice) and select the Update Syntax action.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom go.mod: Open the module file containing the go 1.26 directive and click Analyze code for syntax updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Refactor menu: Click Refactor and select Update Syntax.\n\n\n\n\nGoLand collects the results in a separate tab under the Syntax updates node in the Problems tool window. You can review the updates one by one or apply them in bulk.\n\n\n\n\nGoLand shows a before-and-after diff for each suggested update, so you can review the exact rewrite before you apply it.\n\n\n\n\nWhat this approach to syntax updates changes in practice\nMigration to a new Go version is rarely one big rewrite. It usually happens over the course of dozens of small, safe modernizations mixed into daily work.\nGoLand supports this workflow in a few connected steps:\nIt helps you notice update candidates early. When you edit code that can be modernized, GoLand highlights it in the editor.\nIt offers a safe rewrite. You can apply a quick-fix that rewrites the code to the Go 1.26 form without changing its behavior.\nIt scales to the whole project. When you are ready, run Analyze code for other syntax updates on a wider scope and review the suggested updates before you apply them.\nIt lets you apply updates in bulk. From the list of results in the Problems tool window, you can apply fixes one by one or apply a grouped fix to update many occurrences at once.\nThis combination lets you move your codebase forward without turning the migration into a separate project. You update a line, you see a better form, you apply it, and you keep going.\nHappy coding!\nThe GoLand team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This tutorial was written by an external contributor.\nVivek Kumar Maskara\nVivek Kumar Maskara is an Associate Software Engineer at JP Morgan. He loves writing code, developing apps, creating websites, and writing technical blogs about his experiences. His profile and contact information can be found at maskaravivek.com.\nWebsite | Twitter\nOver a decade ago, Netflix became one of the early adopters of microservice architecture, showcasing its potential at a large scale. Since then, many companies have jumped on the microservices bandwagon, building their backends this way from day one. While microservices offer isolation and independent scaling, their distributed nature requires managing multiple deployments, monitoring interservice communication, and handling network failures across service boundaries.\nAs teams have gained real-world experience with this complexity, there’s been a shift back toward monoliths, but not the tightly coupled monoliths of the past. Instead, developers are embracing modular monoliths: an architectural pattern where single deployable applications are organized into well-defined modules based on logical boundaries or business domains. Think of an e-commerce platform where users, products, and orders live in separate modules that interact through clear contracts, such as APIs for synchronous calls and events for async communication. This separation lets teams work in parallel for faster development and better maintainability, while single-unit deployment keeps releases simple and avoids microservice operational complexity.\nIn this guide, we explore how modular monoliths differ from traditional monoliths, why they’re gaining traction, and how to build them using Spring Modulith and Kotlin.\nThe Need for Modular Monoliths\nThe growing modular monolith countertrend makes more sense when viewed against the shortcomings of traditional approaches.\nTraditional Monoliths\nTraditional monoliths bundle the entire backend into a single codebase with tight coupling between user interfaces, business logic, and data access patterns. In an e-commerce platform, for example, the product catalog, checkout, payments, and order history services are in a single codebase and are deployed together. A monolith uses function calls for internal communication, and often, the call patterns and interdependencies become messy or difficult to maintain.\nMicroservices\nMicroservices emerged to solve these maintainability challenges by splitting backends into loosely coupled services, each handling a specific domain. A cab-hailing platform may separate users, drivers, ride matching, payments, and notifications into independent services. However, this introduces distributed system challenges, including complex service discovery, coordinating deployments across dependent services, and debugging interservice communication issues. Without proper expertise, tooling, and observability, this can slow down development.\nBenefits of Modular Monoliths\nModular monoliths strike a balance by keeping everything in a single codebase and deploying it as one artifact, while structuring the application into logical modules with well-defined interfaces. This addresses the challenges of distributed systems while maintaining the structural benefits of well-defined interfaces and independent development workflows. Some benefits of a modular monolith include:\nSimplified deployment: A single deployment artifact simplifies the release process because you don’t need to coordinate multiple service rollouts, manage service meshes, or handle distributed database migrations and rollbacks.\nReliable testing: As modules in a monolith communicate in-process rather than over a network, integration tests are faster and more stable. You can use mocks where needed, avoid brittle network dependencies, and run end-to-end (E2E) and performance tests in a controlled environment.\nStronger domain modeling: Modular monoliths group related business logic into modules, with clear ownership and communication boundaries between modules. It enforces communication only through well-defined interfaces and enables domain objects to be shared directly without serialization or cross-service APIs. This makes the system easier to maintain and improves development velocity.\nIn-process communication: Since modules communicate through direct method invocations instead of network calls, it reduces latency and points of failure.\nDesigning a Modular Monolith\nWhen you’re building a modular monolith, you first identify the business domains and split the application into multiple loosely coupled modules with clear boundaries and dependencies. Unlike the tightly interwoven code of a traditional monolith, the modular design ensures that the modules can be developed and maintained independently while still being deployed as a single unit. For example, you can break down an e-commerce platform into separate modules such as users, product catalog, shopping cart, payments, and orders:\n\n\n\n\nEach module encapsulates a specific entity or capability. A product catalog module would manage product details and categories, and an order processing module would handle order and payment entities. \nUnlike traditional monoliths, where internal calls often use ad hoc dependencies, in a modular monolith, the interactions with other modules are performed using explicit interfaces and well-defined contracts. This ensures that the intermodule dependencies remain clear and intentional. The communication between the modules uses in-process function calls, so it’s faster and less error-prone compared to network-based interservice calls in microservices.\nThe modular structure allows logical separation between the modules and enforces fixed boundaries, increasing development speed, improving maintainability, and making testing more reliable. Each module defines its user interface, business logic, and data access layers separately:\n\n\n\n\nThese boundaries also lay the groundwork for extracting a particular module as a microservice based on the scaling requirements.\nIntegrate Spring Modulith\nSpring Modulith is a Spring Boot framework that’s based on modular monolith architectural principles. It helps identify, structure, and enforce application modules. It also includes tools for verifying module boundaries and observing their behavior, along with module-level testing capabilities, making Spring Boot applications easier to build and maintain.\nHere’s how to integrate Spring Modulith into a Kotlin-based Spring Boot application.\nAll the code samples are drawn from a fully working Kotlin example, which you can find in this GitHub repository.\nRepository with the companion code for the tutorial\nGo to GitHub\n                                                    \nQuick Start Kotlin Example\nSpring Modulith can be added to any Spring Boot application by including its dependencies in the project’s build.gradle.kts:\n// build.gradle.kts\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\"org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter\")\n    implementation(\"org.springframework.modulith:spring-modulith-starter-core:1.4.3\")\n}\nNote: If your project uses Maven, you can add these dependencies to the pom.xml file.\nTo define the modules, you need to add relevant package directories to the src directory. This code snippet illustrates order and product packages added to the application, each handling its own business logic, data, and services:\nSpringModulithExample\n└── src/main/java\n    ├── example\n    │   └── SpringmonolithApplication.kt\n    └── example.order\n        └── …\n    └── example.product\n        └── …\n    └── example.payment\n        └── …\nWithin each of the modules, you can define the business logic, service, and data access layers based on your application’s requirements. The following code snippet shows a ProductService within the example.product package that returns a static greeting message:\npackage com.example.springmonolith.product\n\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Service\n\n@Service\nclass ProductService {\n\n    fun getGreeting(): String {\n        return \"Hello from Product Module!\"\n    }\n}\nSimilarly, define an OrderService within the example.order package that invokes ProductService::getGreeting() and returns a combined greeting message:\npackage com.example.springmonolith.order\n\nimport com.example.springmonolith.product.ProductService\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Service\n\n@Service\nclass OrderService(\n    private val productService: ProductService\n) {\n\n    fun getGreeting(): String {\n        return \"Hello from Order Module!\"\n    }\n    \n    fun getCombinedGreeting(): String {\n        return \"Hello from Order Module and: ${productService.getGreeting()}\"\n    }\n}\nAfter adding similar business logic for each of the modules (eg ProductService, PaymentService), you also need to add the @Modulithic annotation to the Spring Boot Application class to mark it as modular. \nThe annotation tells Spring Modulith to automatically detect modules based on package structure and enable the tooling for verification, testing, and observability:\npackage com.example.springmonolith\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication\nimport org.springframework.boot.runApplication\nimport org.springframework.modulith.Modulithic\n\n// add this annotation to the application\n@Modulithic\n@SpringBootApplication\nclass SpringmonolithApplication\n\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    runApplication<SpringmonolithApplication>(*args)\n}\nDefining allowed module dependencies\nNext, you can update the package info file for each of the modules to define the allowed module dependencies. Since the order module depends on the methods defined in the product module, you’ll need to add the following annotation in the order/package-info.java file:\n// add this annotation\n@org.springframework.modulith.ApplicationModule(allowedDependencies = {\"product\"})\n@org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi\npackage com.example.springmonolith.order;\nFinally, you can update the product/package-info.java file to set an empty dependency list for the product module:\n// add this annotation\n@org.springframework.modulith.ApplicationModule(allowedDependencies = {})\n@org.springframework.lang.NonNullApi\npackage com.example.springmonolith.product;\nThe above annotation ensures that if a class or object defined in the product module tries to invoke a method defined outside the module, Spring Modulith verification tests will flag the violation. You will see an example of this scenario in later sections.\nSpring Modulith Features\nSpring Modulith supports various tools for working with modules, including module verification, documentation, and runtime observability. With @Modulithic, the application automatically recognizes its modules (based on package structure) and enables the modulith tooling. Let’s look at how these work.\nModular Structure Checks\nSpring Modulith provides built-in tooling to verify that the module boundaries adhere to the constraints. It checks for cyclic dependencies, validates that modules access other modules only through their public API packages (not internal code), and enforces explicit dependency rules. In your tests, you can use the ApplicationModules.verify() to verify the modular structure:\nApplicationModules.of(Application::class.java).verify()\nRefer to the source code on GitHub for a complete example of the ModularityTest. With the above test configured, if the ProductService tries to invoke an order module method, the module verification test will fail. You can test the behavior by extending the ProductService to call getGreeting as shown below:\n// add import\nimport com.example.springmonolith.order.OrderService\n\n@Service\nclass ProductService(\n    private val orderService: OrderService\n) {\n    \n    // add this after getGreeting()\n    fun getCombinedGreeting(): String {\n        return \"Hello from Product Module and: ${orderService.getGreeting()}\"\n    }\n}\nSince product module is configured to disallow all intermodule dependencies, when you run unit tests (./gradlew test), you would get a module violation error as shown below:\n— TRUNCATED OUTPUT —\nModularityTests > verifiesModularStructure() FAILED\n    org.springframework.modulith.core.Violations at ModularityTests.kt:20\nYou can replace direct intermodule calls with application events that let one module publish a domain event and another module listens to it. This preserves boundaries and avoids compile-time coupling between modules. For example, the order module can publish an event when an order is created, as shown below:\n// order module\nimport org.springframework.context.ApplicationEventPublisher\n\n@Service\nclass OrderService(private val events: ApplicationEventPublisher) {\n\n    fun completeOrder(orderId: String) {\n        events.publishEvent(OrderCompleted(orderId))\n    }\n}\n\ndata class OrderCompleted(val orderId: String)\nNotice that the completeOrder method publishes the OrderCompleted event, and other modules (eg, InventoryPolicy) could react to the event using @ApplicationModuleListener, as shown below:\n// product module\nimport org.springframework.modulith.events.ApplicationModuleListener\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Component\n\n@Component\nclass InventoryPolicy {\n\n    @ApplicationModuleListener\n    fun on(event: OrderCompleted) {\n        println(\"Updating inventory for order: ${event.orderId}\")\n    }\n}\nNotice that the InventoryPolicy component has a listener configured for the OrderCompleted event that prints the order ID when it receives the event. Refer to the refactor branch on GitHub for a complete example on domain events.\nModular Level Testing\nModulith supports writing integration tests scoped to a single module. You can annotate a test class with @ApplicationModuleTests to test the module and its dependencies in isolation. This avoids the need to spin up the entire application, reducing setup overhead and making tests more reliable. For example, this code snippet shows a bare-bones integration test for the product module:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\nimport org.springframework.modulith.test.ApplicationModuleTests\n\n@ApplicationModuleTests\nclass ProductModuleTests {\n\n    @Test\n    fun testProductServiceGreeting() {\n        val greeting = productService.getGreeting()\n        assertTrue(greeting.contains(\"Product Module\"))\n    }\n}\nFor the OrderService test, since it depends on the product module, you need to set the extraIncludes parameter in the @ApplicationModuleTests annotation to include it as shown below:\npackage com.example.springmonolith.order\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired\nimport org.springframework.modulith.test.ApplicationModuleTest\nimport org.springframework.test.context.junit.jupiter.SpringJUnitConfig\nimport kotlin.test.assertTrue\n\n@ApplicationModuleTest(extraIncludes = [\"product\"])\n@SpringJUnitConfig\nclass OrderModuleTests {\n\n    @Autowired\n    private lateinit var orderService: OrderService\n\n    @Test\n    fun testOrderServiceGreeting() {\n        val greeting = orderService.getGreeting()\n        assertTrue(greeting.contains(\"Order Module\"))\n    }\n}\nObservability into Module Interactions\nSpring Modulith helps generate developer documentation using the Documenter abstraction. This tool can generate Unified Modeling Language (UML) component diagrams describing the relationship between modules and can also generate a tabular view of the key elements of a module. \nThis code snippet generates an application module component diagram using Documenter:\nclass DocumentationTests {\n    private val modules = ApplicationModules.of(SpringmonolithApplication::class.java)\n\n    @Test\n    fun writeDocumentationSnippets() {\n        Documenter(modules)\n            .writeModulesAsPlantUml()\n            .writeIndividualModulesAsPlantUml()\n    }\n}\nSpring Modulith also integrates with Micrometer to capture spans for module interactions. These spans can be sent to tracing tools such as Zipkin to generate runtime visualizations, making it easier to inspect which modules depend on each other, see how events flow across modules, and monitor interactions in production.\nDeciding When to Use a Modular Monolith\nAlthough a modular monolith can be the ideal balance between simplicity and structure in many cases, it isn’t universally the right choice.\nModular Monolith Use Cases\nEarly-stage development or limited resources: In the early stages of a product or when working with small teams, a modular monolith reduces operational overhead. Developers can focus on delivering features quickly without the complexity of distributed systems. The modular design still enforces boundaries between business capabilities, so if the system grows, you can gradually migrate high-demand modules into separate microservices.\n\nExample: A food delivery platform can start with modules for restaurants, menu, and orders inside a single deployable unit, but it can later extract and deploy one of the modules as a microservice.\nComplex business domains: Applications that involve complex business logic, workflows, or dependencies can benefit from a modular structure. By encapsulating each business capability in its own module, the system becomes easier to develop, test, and maintain.\n\nExample: An insurance platform can split policy management, claims processing, and customer support into separate modules to avoid creating interdependencies that can become difficult to maintain.\nWhen Modular Monoliths Aren’t Always the Right Choice\nSystems with independent scaling needs: Some systems have uneven load patterns where certain components handle millions of requests daily, while others are rarely used. Because modular monoliths deploy as one unit, you can’t scale individual parts independently. A microservice-based approach can more easily scale components that expect a higher load than others.\n\nExample: In an e-commerce platform, the product catalog or recommendation services may experience higher request volumes than order or payment services.\nSystems that use diverse tech stacks: In some organizations, different teams rely on different programming languages, runtimes, or specialized infrastructure for different parts of the system. A modular monolith requires the entire application to use the same stack, which can limit flexibility. In these cases, a microservice-based architecture can provide the isolation needed to mix and match technologies.\n\nExample: Machine learning or analytics teams may want to use Python or Go for their services, while client-facing or internal services can be based on Kotlin or Java.\nConclusion\nModular monolith architecture allows you to split the application logic into isolated modules with their own business logic, while still being deployed as a single artifact. It combines the benefits of a modular design while maintaining the development and release-related benefits of a monolithic architecture. Additionally, modern programming languages such as Kotlin provide tools that can help you achieve monolith stability without giving up the productivity that draws people to microservices.\nSpring Modulith and Kotlin provide the tools to design and enforce clear module boundaries, test modules independently, and monitor their interactions. Try out Spring Modulith to build modular Kotlin applications, while keeping the flexibility to evolve into microservices if your scaling needs change.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post is available as well as a YouTube video.\nIn Scala 2, Scaladoc used Wikidoc syntax, which has advanced features like templates, categories, and metadata. These are useful for organizing and structuring large volumes of documentation, but they are rarely used in code comments.  On the other hand, Markdown offers a simpler, more readable syntax; in many cases, you can read it as raw text without any issues. Markdown is also much more popular and already used in README files and other documentation files, so it simply makes sense to use it in Scaladoc as well.\nThe best example of this is probably how tables are written in Markdown. \n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the raw version of the table is simply a table made in ASCII which, at least in case the data is short and simple, can be read without rendering.\nIn Scala 3, both Wikidoc and Markdown are supported, but Markdown has been chosen as the default syntax. In other words, if you add a documentation comment (i.e. one starting with a slash and two asterisks, /** … */) to a class, method, or field declaration, by default we will assume its formatted with Markdown.\nMarkdown syntax\nIn the new release, IntelliJ Scala Plugin provides support for the new Scaladoc. That means all the following syntax features are supported:\nHeaders starting with a hash (#) in front of it, as well as headers made by underlining the text with the equality signs (=) in the next line.\nSmaller, “sub-chapter”, headers with multiple hashes or with the hyphens (-) in the next line.\nOrdered and unordered lists – on top of rendering them, the Scala plugin also automatically generates new indices and bullet points when you write them. You can make sub-lists too: When rendered, the ordered list will have deeper indentation for its sub-lists, while a sub-list of the unordered one will have different bullet points.\nBlock quotes with the “greater than” sign (>). If you start writing multiline quotes, the Scala Plugin will automatically generate signs for the next lines. Just as with lists, you can also write nested block quotes.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBold, italic, and bold italic font, made with either  asterisks (*) or underscore (_) signs. If you type just one asterisk or one underscore sign, the Scala Plugin will generate the other, closing one, and whatever you type between them will be rendered in italics. If you use two asterisks or two underscores on one side, the text in the middle will become bold. If you use three, the text will be rendered both italic and bold.\nSame for strike-through text, made with two tildes (~~).\nLinks with [link](text). If you render it and click it, IntelliJ IDEA will open your default web browser and direct you to the given webpage.\nCode anchors with [[name]]. The text within double square brackets should be a name of an existing class, trait, etc. While you write it, the Scala Plugin will display a code completion popup to help you find it. After rendering, you will see the anchor highlighted as if it was a link, but when you click on it, instead of redirecting you to that element, the Scala Plugin will display the documentation comment attached to it.\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizontal lines, made with an empty line followed by three hyphens (—). The empty line is important because otherwise the line made of hyphens will be understood as a sub-chapter header.\nInline code – both started with upper ticks and the <code> tag. \nMultiline code blocks – both started with curly braces {{{ … }}} and backticks “` … “`.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd tables, which we already discussed above, but there’s one more thing to add – with the following syntax you can control the text alignment within the table’s columns:\n\n\n\n\nBackward compatibility\nIf you want to switch back to the old wikidoc syntax, put the @syntax wiki directive in the directives section at the end of the comment block. This is important because the @syntax directive is treated similarly to other directives like @param and @return and should be put together with them. If you make a mistake and put it at the top or inside the comment, everything below the directive will fail to render.\nHow to render\nThere are three ways to render Scaladoc in IntelliJ IDEA with the Scala Plugin:\nClick the gutter icon to the left of the first Scaladoc line. The documentation will render directly in the editor.\nHover the cursor over the comment block. A popup with rendered content will appear.\nIf the comment block is attached to a code element, such as a class or a method, you can hover the cursor over its name, regardless if it’s its definition or a call to it from another place in the code. This will also display a popup with rendered content.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following sources:\nScaladoc | Style Guide | Scala Documentation\nGuide to Scaladoc | Baeldung on Scala\nScaladoc for Library Authors | Scaladoc | Scala Documentation\n\n\n\n\nHappy developing!\nThe Scala team at JetBrains",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "(This opinion piece by JetBrains’ Team Lead in AI Development Experience reflects on key takeaways from NeurIPS 2025, a major AI research conference. It explains why these insights matter and considers related signals emerging from other recent research.)\nMass layoffs, robots taking control of the planet, a post-truth world. Which of these comes to mind first when we talk about the disruptive innovation AI brings?\nIn her NeurIPS talk, “Are We Having the Wrong Nightmares About AI?”, Zeynep Tufekci argues that societies systematically misread the impact of major technological transformations in their early stages. We prepare for risks we already understand, like generals organizing for the previous war, while missing the challenges that actually matter.\nA growing theme in the research community is that AI’s intelligence is categorically different from human intelligence. That directly challenges the mental model of linear AI progress – the assumption that AI will “grow up” as a person does. \nNot less capable, but differently capable\nLLMs can beat humans on many benchmarks and tests, yet they still struggle with basic tasks beyond their generative capabilities. A simple physical task makes this gap tangible. \nThe image below illustrates the simple task of how to open a glass beer bottle with a metal house key; the model fails, despite the task being familiar and rather straightforward for most people. \n\n\n\n\nPrompt: You need to open a glass bottle of beer, but you don’t have a bottle opener handy. However, you have a metal house key. Illustrate how to use the key to open the bottle. Model: gpt-image-1.5.\nThis contrast shows a recurring pattern. LLMs can perform well above a professional level on some structured, text-based problems, then fail on others that even children can handle with ease. The issue is not a question of capability; rather, it is a matter of frame of reference. These systems do not sit higher or lower on a human scale. They operate on a different scale altogether.\nAI as another form of intelligence\nIn 2025, a widespread view was that AI in its current form represents another kind of intelligence, one that cannot be directly projected onto a human talent scale. Despite rapid progress, an old research goal remains unresolved: How do we help large language models to perform the kinds of practical tasks that every human can?\nLLMs can match or outperform humans in structured, text-based evaluations, yet they continue to lag behind when it comes to working out genuinely novel solutions and adapting when faced with complex, non-stationary settings.\nSeveral researchers argue that this gap reflects a deeper mismatch between human and model learning. Zeynep Tufekci stresses that generative AI is not a form of human intelligence, while Blake Lemoine puts it more bluntly: “Only one thing is clear: LLMs are not human.”\nStudies comparing children and models show that young children can infer causal structures from only a handful of observations. In contrast, large language models struggle to identify the relevant causal relationships at all.\nOther experiments demonstrate that in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs fail to match human adaptability, particularly when effective directed exploration matters.\nStrong evaluations don’t translate into impact (yet?)\nThis disconnect may help explain what Ilya Sutskever described as one of the confusing aspects of current models. They perform extremely well on evaluations, yet the economic impact trails far behind. \nStrong benchmark results do not translate directly into robust performance in open-ended, real-world settings.\nIn a software development context, this has direct implications. We should not align LLMs with humans, neither in the requirements we impose on development processes nor in the outputs we expect them to produce. \nAs we involve LLMs more deeply, with their distinct strengths and limitations, the surrounding processes will need to change accordingly. Effective use will come less from forcing models into human-shaped roles and more from reshaping workflows to fit the kind of intelligence they actually provide.\nLLMs will transform ecosystems\nWhen we talk about technology ecosystems, we often focus on tools. Biological ecosystems remind us that this view is incomplete. An ecosystem includes not only the organisms, but also the environment they live in, and that environment is neither static nor passive. \nOrganisms actively shape it, and in doing so, they create conditions that favour their own survival and reproduction, while sometimes destroying environments that no longer serve them.\nSoftware development has followed a similar pattern. Codebases, programming languages, build systems, and deployment practices have repeatedly reshaped not only the code itself, but also collaboration and development processes. These elements form the environment in which development tools operate, and they co-evolve with those tools.\nGiven the pace of LLM adoption, we should expect a comparable shift. LLMs are unlikely to remain passive inhabitants of today’s development environment. Instead, the ecosystem itself will change to better suit their strengths. \nLanguages, best practices, and workflows will emerge, evolve, or disappear based on how compatible they are with an LLM-dominated environment and how effectively they enable AI-driven work.\nThe sweetness of the bitter lesson\nRichard Sutton, one of the pioneers of reinforcement learning, formulated what he called the “bitter lesson” after decades of AI research. \nHis observation was that many apparent breakthroughs come from injecting human knowledge into systems, for example, by hand-crafting rules, heuristics, or domain-specific structures. \nThese approaches often deliver quick wins. Over time, however, they tend to lose to more general methods that rely on learning and search capabilities, and that scale with increases in computation and data.\nSutton’s point was not that human knowledge is useless, but that it becomes a limiting factor. Systems built around general methods continue to improve as computing grows, while systems constrained by human-designed shortcuts eventually hit a ceiling.\nApplied to software development, the implication is significant. If we treat development processes, tools, and workflows as methods, then approaches that maximize effective AI utilization are likely to win over time. \nIn contrast, approaches that restrict AI involvement or introduce friction, including heavy human-in-the-loop dependencies, risk becoming bottlenecks as models and infrastructure continue to scale.\nA view towards the future\nPredictions in 2026 are hard. Still, the research points in a consistent direction. LLMs are a different beast, and we should stop treating them as junior humans who will replace us one by one. \nThey will reshape the software development environment to suit their particular kind of intelligence. \nAlongside incremental improvements to today’s workflows, we should explore more radical shifts, deliberately reshaping codebases and processes to maximize effective AI utilization.",

The survey shows that developers continue to adopt Rust across learning, hobby, and professional contexts, indicating sustained interest rather than short-term experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The survey provides statistically meaningful insights into Rust adoption, developer experience levels, and usage patterns across different types of projects.\n65% of respondents say they use Rust for side or hobby projects, while 52% report that they are currently learning the language. At the same time, 26% of developers already use Rust in professional projects. This mix highlights a healthy adoption pattern in which experimentation and learning coexist with real-world usage.\nNewcomers continue to fuel Rust’s popularity\nRust’s momentum is reinforced by a steady influx of new users. In 2025, 30% of respondents reported that they started using Rust less than a month ago. This is a significant increase compared to previous years and a clear sign that interest in Rust is not slowing down.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the share of developers who have been using Rust for 3 years or more continues to grow, showing that Rust not only attracts newcomers but also retains long-term users.\n\n\n\n    \n“My teaching experience this year has been a lot of groups moving to Rust from existing C and C++ projects, particularly in the government and government-adjacent sector. They are generally having a pretty positive experience, and the language has evolved sufficiently that the learning curve doesn’t feel vertical anymore to these users.”\n\n            \nHerbert Wolverson\n                                                                Author of Hands-on Rust book and consultant at Ardan Labs\n                                    \nWhy does Rust remain popular? \nDevelopers continue to choose Rust for its performance, memory safety, and reliability. As tooling, documentation, and learning resources improve, Rust becomes easier to adopt without losing its core strengths.\nTogether, these factors explain why Rust remains popular. Developers are not just talking about Rust – they are learning it, experimenting with it, and increasingly using it in real projects.\nWho uses Rust today?\nTo understand the changing demographics in the Rust ecosystem, it helps to look beyond raw numbers and focus on who these developers are. The Rust community in 2025 combines a large number of newcomers with a strong base of experienced developers, making for a unique and balanced ecosystem.\nMost Rust users are experienced developers\nThe majority of Rust users already had programming experience before they started learning it. This means Rust adoption is largely driven by developers who have worked with other languages and systems and are making a conscious choice to explore Rust. These are not beginners picking a first language, but professionals and hobbyists looking for better tools.\n\n\n\n    \n“Wow – what a fascinating graph. Although many would see this and think only 1 in 20 Rust programmers learned it as their first language, I am delighted to see that we attract so many. I hope that they are enjoying building. \n\r\n\r\nIt must be said though that Rust generally attracts programmers with more experience. I see two main reasons for this – one positive and one negative. \n\r\n\r\nOn the positive side for Rust, it’s clearly attracting people who are frustrated with the alternatives. Rust offers a viable alternative to brittle and insecure software. It’s wonderful that the language is a magnet for smart people. Learning a language requires a certain amount of grit. Rust justifies that investment.\n\r\n\r\nViewed more negatively though, there could be a warning here. It seems Rust’s reputation for being too difficult has become quite sticky. It definitely took a few attempts before I learned the language, and I’ve been hoping that we’ll be better at enabling “Rust as a first programming language” for some time.\n\r\n\r\nAI agents are not intimidated by the Rust learning curve, though. Its type hints and error messages mean that coding agents can learn Rust very well. And given that learners will be driving those agents, we can expect that more learners will explore “hard” languages, including Rust.\n\r\n\r\nWith all that said however, perhaps this graph just shows that Rust is still small. Non-dominant language communities will always have a high proportion of members with experience from elsewhere.”\n\n            \nTim McNamara\n                                                                Founder of Accelerant.dev, author of Rust in Action\n                                    \n\n\n\n\nDevelopers come to Rust from many ecosystems\nMany developers who adopt Rust arrive from widely used languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, C++, and JavaScript. This diversity helps explain why Rust appears in so many different contexts. Web developers, backend engineers, and systems programmers all bring their own expectations and use cases, pushing the ecosystem to grow in multiple directions at once.\n\n\n\n\nThis mix of experience and backgrounds helps Rust mature faster. Newcomers benefit from an ecosystem shaped by real-world demands, while experienced developers help validate Rust as a serious option for long-term projects.\n“All roads lead to Rust!\n\r\nFurthermore, Rust is increasingly a brownfield language: it shows up alongside the languages people already know, not instead of them.\n\r\nPython developers reach for Rust (via PyO3/maturin) to speed up hot paths without rewriting their entire codebase. Ruby and Elixir shops do the same via native extensions. Meanwhile, C and C++ teams use Rust to incrementally harden their systems: new modules in Rust, old ones migrated over time, the two coexisting at the FFI boundary for months or years.\n\r\n”\n\n            \nLuca Palmieri\n                                                                Author of 100 Exercises to Learn Rust and Principal Engineering Consultant at Mainmatter\n                                    \nWhy newcomers choose Rust\nWhile many Rust users are experienced programmers, a large share are still new to Rust itself. This steady flow of newcomers is one of the most important forces shaping the ecosystem.\nMany developers begin exploring Rust with clear motivations: They want performance without sacrificing safety, or stronger guarantees than they’ve experienced in other languages. Rust’s focus on memory safety, correctness, and predictability aligns well with these goals.\nTo help developers navigate Rust’s learning curve, JetBrains provides several educational resources designed to support different learning styles and experience levels.\nHow to Learn Rust: Vitaly Bragilevsky’s guide lays out a practical approach to learning Rust, explaining the language’s core concepts, common beginner challenges, and how tools like RustRover can support the learning process. It offers clear strategies, recommended resources, and a realistic path for newcomers to build confidence with Rust.\nLearn Rust plugin: This guided learning plugin teaches Rust fundamentals through interactive lessons, editor hints, and instant feedback. It works in both RustRover and CLion, so developers can learn inside the IDE while writing real code.\n100 Exercises to Learn Rust: Based on 100 Exercises to Learn Rust by Mainmatter’s Luca Palmieri, this course offers a hands-on, test-driven path through Rust, starting with your first println! and progressing to advanced concepts like ownership, lifetimes, pattern matching, and generics.\nThese resources make it easier for you to move from curiosity to confidence. They help explain not just how Rust works, but why it works the way it does, which is key to mastering the language.\nThe Rust Ecosystem Today: Tools, Workflows, and Maturity\nA language’s success with newcomers depends not only on syntax or features, but on how well developers can work with it day to day. These workflows reduce friction, making Rust easier to pick up and Rust projects easier to maintain over time. In 2025, Rust’s ecosystem shows clear signs of maturity.\nTooling plays a central role in this progress. Cargo provides a consistent foundation for building, testing, and managing dependencies, while formatting and linting tools help teams maintain quality and consistency. These workflows reduce friction and make Rust projects easier to maintain over time.\nTry RustRover\n                                    \nWhat developers build with Rust in 2025\nRust’s use cases offer a clear view of where the ecosystem stands today. Let’s look at what developers are actually building with it.\n\n\n\n\nSystems programming and command-line tools continue to sit at the heart of Rust’s identity. These domains reflect the problems Rust was originally designed to solve, and they still attract developers who need performance, control, and safety.\nAt the same time, Rust’s role has broadened significantly. Web and backend development are now common use cases, showing that Rust is increasingly trusted for building services and APIs. This shift matters because backend systems are often long-lived and business-critical, so choosing Rust here signals confidence in its stability and ecosystem support.\nBeyond its core areas, Rust is used in networking, embedded systems, security, scientific computing, and early AI-related tooling. While some of these domains are still smaller, their presence shows that developers are willing to apply Rust to a wide range of challenges. The ecosystem no longer fits a narrow definition, and that flexibility supports long-term growth.\nRust rarely lives alone in real projects\nRust is most often used alongside other programming languages rather than in isolation. JavaScript and TypeScript lead this list, followed by Python, SQL, and shell scripting languages. This reflects how Rust is commonly integrated into existing stacks, powering performance-critical components while working alongside higher-level languages.\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of languages like C, C++, Java, and Go further highlights Rust’s role in mixed environments, especially in systems, backend, and infrastructure projects. At the same time, more than one-third of respondents report using Rust on its own, showing that the language is also mature enough to support complete projects end to end.\n“Rust is often described as a true all-purpose language that successfully covers a wide range of tasks. The data confirms this, as the top entries among complementary languages ​​are JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. JavaScript/TypeScript holds an exclusive position in the world’s largest runtime, the browser, and this is difficult to challenge. Python, on the other hand, is indispensable in many sectors due to its accessibility and incredibly rich ecosystem. And well, I think SQL falls into this category as well. However, when you consider all the other languages, there’s no reason not to switch to Rust, except perhaps to keep legacy projects alive. I’m curious how this will change in the future. My prediction is that the bars at the bottom of this chart will become much smaller over the years.”\n\n            \nStefan Baumgartner\n                                                                Author of TypeScript Cookbook (O’Reilly) – oida.dev\n                                    \nRust targets production platforms first\nRust projects overwhelmingly target production environments. Linux is by far the most common platform, used by three-quarters of respondents, reflecting Rust’s strong presence in server, cloud, and infrastructure workloads. Windows and macOS also see substantial usage, confirming Rust’s role in cross-platform development. This focus on production and infrastructure aligns with broader industry adoption trends discussed in the LWN analysis of Rust’s role in modern systems software.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond traditional operating systems, Rust continues to expand into specialized environments. WebAssembly and embedded targets are used by a meaningful share of developers, while mobile platforms appear less frequently. These results show that Rust is primarily chosen for reliability and performance in production systems, with growing interest in newer deployment models.\nAI adoption in the Rust developer workflow\nArtificial intelligence has become a visible part of everyday development work, and Rust developers are no exception. The 2025 survey shows a community that is actively experimenting with AI tools while remaining thoughtful about how these technologies fit into long-term workflows.\nHow Rust developers feel about AI\nRust developers approach AI with a mix of optimism and caution. One-third of respondents describe themselves as hopeful about AI’s increasing role in society, while others express uncertainty or anxiety. This balance reflects a community that values progress but also cares deeply about correctness, safety, and long-term impact.\n\n\n\n\nRather than reacting emotionally, many Rust developers appear to be evaluating AI through a practical lens. They are interested in productivity gains, yet remain aware of the limitations and risks. This mindset aligns closely with Rust’s broader culture of deliberate design and explicit trade-offs.\n“It makes perfect sense! We’re a community that explicitly chose strict correctness over quick hacks. The ‘Hopeful’ group sees a tool to handle the boilerplate; the ‘Anxious’ group is just worried about debugging hallucinations. Optimism is high, but the code review standards remain higher. Cheers!”\n\n            \nFrancesco Ciulla\n                                                                Rust educator, International Public speaker, Docker Captain\n                                    \nAI tools are already part of everyday development\nAI tools became a familiar part of Rust development in 2025. According to the survey, 89% of respondents have tried at least one AI tool, and 78% are actively using AI-powered coding assistants. ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot lead in regular usage, while dedicated AI editors and JetBrains AI Assistant are also widely explored.\n\n\n\n\nUsage patterns show diversity rather than dominance by a single tool. Developers combine general-purpose AI assistants with IDE-integrated solutions, choosing what fits their workflow rather than committing to one approach. This flexibility suggests that AI is becoming another tool in the toolbox, not a replacement for developer judgment.\nTry AI for Free\n                                    \nRegular usage and interest in AI coding agents\nAI tools are clearly embedded in day-to-day work. About one-third of Rust developers regularly use ChatGPT, with GitHub Copilot close behind. IDE-integrated assistants are also gaining traction, reflecting a preference for AI support that fits naturally into existing development environments.\nHere are the AI coding assistants, agents, and code editors most commonly used for Rust development in 2025:\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, interest in AI coding agents is strong but measured. Around one-quarter of respondents say they are very likely to try coding agents in the next year, while others remain unsure or cautious. This split highlights a familiar Rust pattern: curiosity paired with a desire for control, transparency, and reliability.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data suggests that Rust developers are not resisting AI, but rather integrating it carefully. They adopt tools that provide real value today, while remaining selective about more autonomous systems. This thoughtful adoption mirrors how the Rust ecosystem itself has evolved – steadily, intentionally, and with a focus on long-term quality.\n“Newer models are growing more capable of working in large, complex codebases. Rust’s built-in documentation, expressive type system, and readable compiler errors provide agents the context they need to work effectively. Whether using them for code review, complex refactors, expanding test coverage, or exploring new features, I am excited to see how experimenting with these new tools can help us all ship more robust and resilient software.”\n\n            \nBen Brandt \n                                                                Software Engineer at Zed\n                                    \nWhat 2025 tells us about Rust’s future\nData from the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 points to a strong and stable future for Rust. A growing community of newcomers ensures continued interest, while experienced developers bring production-grade use cases that deepen trust in the language. Expanding adoption across backend services, infrastructure, embedded systems, and emerging AI tooling suggests that Rust’s role will continue to broaden.\nImprovements in tooling and workflows further support long-term adoption. As Rust becomes easier to learn and more comfortable to use at scale, it is well-positioned to remain relevant as industry needs evolve. Rust’s trajectory reflects steady growth built on reliability and thoughtful design, rather than short-term trends.\nA huge thank you to the Rust experts who contributed their expertise, helping us turn these numbers into a much more meaningful story!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI models and coding assistants have become essential tools for developers. Today, developers rely on large language models (LLMs) to accelerate coding, improve code quality, and reduce repetitive work across the entire development lifecycle. From intelligent code completion to refactoring, debugging, and documentation, AI-powered tools are now embedded directly into daily workflows.\nDrawing on insights from the latest JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, this guide compares the top large language models (LLMs) used for programming. It focuses on how leading LLMs balance accuracy, speed, security, cost, and IDE integration, helping developers and teams choose the right model for their specific needs. \nThroughout the article, we also highlight how tools like JetBrains AI Assistant bring these models directly into professional development environments, backed by real-world usage data from the report.\nPlease note that the models listed in the article reflect those available during the research period, and may not reflect the most recent versions.\nTable of contents\nWhat are AI models for coding?\nHow developers choose between AI models\nTop AI models in 2025\nEvaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\nOpen-source vs. proprietary models\nEnterprise readiness and security\nHow to select the right AI coding model for you\nFAQ\nConclusion\nWhat are AI models for coding?\nAI models for coding are large language models (LLMs) trained on vast collections of source code, technical documentation, and natural language text. Their purpose is to understand programming intent and generate relevant, context-aware responses that assist developers during software creation. Unlike traditional static tools, these models can reason about code structure, explain logic, and adapt to different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe best LLMs for programming support a wide range of everyday development tasks, most typically being used for code completion, refactoring, debugging, documentation writing, and test creation. By delegating such repetitive or boilerplate-related tasks to an LLM, developers can turn their attention to more complex problem-solving and system design tasks.\nMost developers interact with AI coding tools through IDE integrations, browser tools, or APIs. This is where IDE-based assistants, such as JetBrains AI Assistant, are particularly valuable, as they operate directly within the development context, using project structure, files, and language semantics to improve accuracy and relevance.\nThe use of AI coding tools is influenced by several critical factors, including accuracy, latency, cost efficiency, and data privacy. According to the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, AI adoption was increasingly widespread, with up to 85% of developers regularly using AI tools for coding and development in 2025.\nAs AI capabilities expand, developers face an important challenge: selecting those AI models that best fit their workflow. The next section discusses how developers can evaluate the various options and make the best decision for their needs.\nHow developers choose between AI models\nDevelopers’ adoption of AI coding tools in 2025 was driven by how well an AI model integrated into real-world workflows and delivered consistent output. This often goes beyond technical specs alone and involves various practical and trust-based factors. \nThe top concern identified in the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 was code quality. IDE integration was another major priority. AI tools for developers that work seamlessly inside familiar environments, such as JetBrains IDEs, are far more likely to be adopted than standalone interfaces. Pricing and licensing also mattered for developers, especially for individual developers and small teams who need predictable or affordable access.\nFor professional teams, data privacy and security increasingly shape decision-making around AI model selection. The ability to control how prompts and code are processed, whether models can be deployed locally, and how data is retained or logged are all critical considerations. Customization options, including fine-tuning and contextual prompts, are also becoming more relevant as teams seek domain-specific optimization.\nOverall, insights from the report indicated a clear divide. Individual developer AI preferences prioritized usability, responsiveness, and cost efficiency. But for organizations, the principal focus areas were compliance, governance, and long-term scalability.\nKey selection factors for AI coding assistants\nThis table summarizes the core criteria developers use for quick comparison.\n\nCriterionWhy it mattersHow to assess\nCode qualityDetermines whether generated code is correct, maintainable, and consistent with best practicesEvaluate accuracy and reasoning in real coding scenarios\nIDE integrationAffects workflow continuity and adoption rateCheck for native support in JetBrains IDEs or other editors\nPrice and licensingInfluences accessibility for individuals and teamsCompare pricing tiers, free limits, and scalability costs\nData privacy and securityEnsures that code and prompts are handled safelyVerify local execution, encryption, and data policy\nLocal or self-hosted optionsImportant for teams with compliance or IP control needsAssess support for private model deployment\nFine-tuning and customizationEnables domain-specific improvements and internal optimisationCheck whether the model supports custom training or contextual prompts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these criteria in mind, the next section explores the top AI models developers used in 2025 and how they compare in practice.\nTop AI models used in 2025\nThe JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 showed that developers did not rely on a single LLM. Instead, they used a small set of the best AI models for coding, depending on accuracy needs, workflow integration, cost constraints, and data-handling requirements.\nBased on developer survey data, the report identified the following AI models in 2025 as the most commonly used and trusted for coding tasks. It forms the basis of an AI coding assistants comparison guide that is grounded in real-world adoption rather than theoretical benchmarks:\nGPT models (OpenAI): Models like GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 were widely used and recognized as some of the best LLMs for programming in day-to-day development, particularly for code generation, refactoring, and explanation tasks. These models were incorporated in daily workflows due to their consistent output quality and large context windows. Their trade-off is cost, especially for teams with heavy usage.\nClaude models (Anthropic): Claude 3.7 Sonnet was commonly chosen by developers working with large files, monorepos, or documentation-heavy projects. It was frequently cited among top AI code assistants for its ability to reason over long inputs and maintain structure in explanations and generated code. However, compared to GPT-based tools, it offered fewer native integrations.\nGemini (Google): Gemini 2.5 Pro appeared most often in workflows tied to Google’s ecosystem. Developers reported using it for tasks that combine coding with documentation, search, or collaborative environments. While it performed well in speed and accessibility, it was less flexible for teams that require deep customization or private deployments when evaluating AI models in 2025.\nDeepSeek: DeepSeek R1 gained attention among developers seeking lower-cost AI coding assistance or local deployment options. It was increasingly included in AI coding assistant comparisons for teams experimenting with AI at scale while maintaining tighter control over data and infrastructure.\nOpen-source models: These models, such as Qwen and StarCoder, represented another category of best LLMs for programming for a smaller but growing segment of developers. They are most popular among teams with strong DevOps capabilities or strict data-governance requirements. While they offer maximum control, they also require significant operational effort.\nOverall, differences in reasoning accuracy, speed, context length, and IDE integration significantly influenced developer preferences when selecting among the best AI models for coding. For instance, some developers prioritized performance and reasoning depth with GPT-4o or Claude 3.7. Others chose more cost-efficient or private alternatives, such as DeepSeek and open-source models, depending on workflow and organizational constraints.\nCapabilities of leading AI models for coding\n\nModelDeployment modelConfig / InterfaceBest forStrengthTrade-off\nGPT-5 / GPT-5.1Cloud / APIText + code inputBroad coding and reasoning tasksHigh accuracy and large contextHigher cost per token\nClaude 3.7 SonnetCloud / APINatural language focusStructured code and documentationContextual reasoning, long input handlingLimited tool integrations\nGemini 2.5 ProCloudMultimodal, Google ecosystemWeb-based workflowsFast response, cloud collaborationLimited fine-tuning\nDeepSeek R1Cloud / LocalAPI and SDKCost-efficient large-scale codingCompetitive performance, local optionSmaller ecosystem\nOpen-source models (Qwen, StarCoder, etc.)Local / Self-hostedVariousPrivacy-first or custom useControl, modifiabilitySetup complexity, maintenance\n\nDisclaimer: models listed reflect those available at the time the research concluded and may not represent the most recent versions.\n\n\n\nPricing and total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison\n\nModel typeCost profileScaling considerations\nGPT familyUsage-based, higher per-token costScales well but requires budget planning\nClaude familyUsage-based, mid-to-high costEfficient for long-context tasks\nGeminiBundled cloud pricingOptimized for cloud environments\nDeepSeekLower usage costsAttractive for frequent queries\nOpen-sourceInfrastructure-dependentNo license fees, higher ops cost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next section builds on this by presenting a clear framework for objectively evaluating these models.\nEvaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\nSelecting an AI coding assistant requires balancing multiple factors rather than optimizing for a single metric, a reality reflected in any meaningful comparison of AI coding assistants. Accuracy, speed, cost, integration, and security all play a role, and their relative importance depends on whether the tool is used for personal productivity, enterprise compliance, or research and experimentation when identifying the best AI for software development.\nDevelopers surveyed in the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 consistently cited code accuracy and IDE integration as top priorities when evaluating LLMs. However, organizational users also emphasized governance, transparency, and scalability as part of a broader AI model assessment.\nCore evaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\n\nCriterionWhy it mattersHow to assess\nAccuracy and reasoningDetermines the reliability of code suggestions, explanations, and test generationCompare model output on real codebases or benchmark problems\nIntegration and workflow fitEnsures smooth adoption inside IDEs and CI/CD pipelinesVerify compatibility with JetBrains IDEs, VS Code, or API connectors\nCost and scalabilityAffects accessibility for individual and organizational usersReview token pricing, API quotas, or enterprise licensing\nSecurity and data privacyProtects proprietary code and complies with organizational standardsCheck data retention policies, encryption, and local deployment options\nContext length and memoryImpacts how well the model understands complex projects or filesEvaluate maximum input size and conversational continuity.\nCustomization and fine-tuningEnables adaptation to specific domains or internal librariesDetermine whether the model allows prompt tuning, embeddings, or private training\nTransparency and governanceImportant for auditability and complianceConfirm whether logs, audit trails, and explainability tools are available\n\n\n\n\n\nThese criteria underscore a fundamental choice developers must make between open-source and proprietary AI models, discussed in the next section.\nOpen-source vs. proprietary models\nAI coding assistants generally fall into two categories: open-source or locally deployed models and commercial, cloud-managed models. A choice between them affects everything from data handling to performance and maintenance.\nThe JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 showed that most developers rely on cloud-based proprietary AI coding tools, but a growing segment preferred local or private deployments due to security and compliance requirements. This group increasingly turned to local LLMs for coding and leveraged open-source models.\nGeneral industry patterns, specifically when it comes to a comparison of AI platforms, suggest there are different reasons behind this choice. Teams that choose open-source AI models for coding often seek transparency, customization, and infrastructure control. Proprietary models, on the other hand, offer faster onboarding, reliability, and vendor-managed updates.\nWhile there is no single “best” option, the selection of either an open-source or proprietary model comes down to organizational priorities such as compliance, scalability, and available DevOps resources. The following comparison table summarizes each type’s advantages, limitations, and best-fit scenarios.\nComparison of open-source and proprietary AI coding models\n\nTypeAdvantagesLimitationsBest fit\nOpen-source / Local models (e.g. StarCoder, Qwen, DeepSeek Local)Full control of infrastructure and data, ability to customize and fine-tune, no recurring license feesRequires setup and maintenance effort; updates and security are handled internally; performance may depend on local hardwareTeams with strong DevOps capabilities or strict data-governance requirements\nProprietary / Managed models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 3.7, Gemini Pro)Fast setup, robust integrations, vendor-handled compliance, predictable performance, and enterprise supportCosts scale with usage; potential vendor lock-in; less transparency in training dataIndividual developers and growing teams focused on speed and reduced operational overhead\n\nDisclaimer: models listed reflect those available at the time of research conclusion and may not represent the most recent versions.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have explored the various models open to developers, we will examine enterprise-readiness and security and consider how organizations evaluate governance, compliance, and reliability when adopting AI coding solutions.\nEnterprise readiness and security\nEnterprise AI coding tools must meet requirements far beyond accuracy or productivity gains. Security, compliance, and governance also play a decisive role.\nAccording to the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, many companies hesitated to adopt AI coding tools due to concerns about data privacy, IP protection, and model transparency.  These need to be addressed to ensure secure AI for developers.\nTo achieve this, enterprise-ready AI models typically offer flexible deployment, role-based access control, encryption, audit logs, policy enforcement, and AI governance and compliance.\nSome tools, such as JetBrains AI Assistant, support both cloud and on-premises integration, which suits teams that need a balance between agility and compliance. The table below also summarizes the capabilities and example tools required to create enterprise-ready LLMs.\nEnterprise evaluation matrix for AI coding tools\n\nCapabilityWhy it mattersExample tools\nDeployment flexibilityEnterprises need to control where data and models run to meet compliance and integration requirementsTeamCity, JetBrains AI Assistant (self-hosted), GitLab, DeepSeek Local\nRole-based access control (RBAC) and SSOCentralizes identity management and reduces risk of unauthorized accessJetBrains AI Assistant, Harness, GitLab\nAudit and traceabilitySupports compliance with ISO, SOC, and internal governance auditsTeamCity, Jenkins (plugins), JetBrains AI Assistant\nPolicy as code / ApprovalsEnables automated enforcement of deployment and review policiesHarness, GitLab, TeamCity\nData privacy and encryptionProtects source code and proprietary data during inference or storageJetBrains AI Assistant, Claude 3.7 (enterprise), DeepSeek Local\nDisaster recovery and backupsMinimizes downtime and preserves continuity in case of system failuresJetBrains Cloud Services, GitLab Self-Managed\nCompliance standardsEnsures alignment with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, or regional equivalentsJetBrains AI Assistant, GitLab, Harness\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we understand how to create an enterprise evaluation matrix, the next section will explain how teams can choose the right AI coding model based on their specific needs, balancing control, speed, and compliance.\nHow to select the right AI coding model for you\nThe best AI for developers depends on context. They must balance control, cost, integration, and compliance to find the best LLM for team workflows, rather than look for a single winner.\nAs you have seen, each model is suited to meet specific needs, be they speed, governance, or flexibility. This 8-step selection framework will guide you on how to find the right AI coding model for your requirements when choosing an AI assistant.\nStep-by-step selection framework\n\nStepQuestionIf “yes” →If “no” →\n1Need full data control or on-premises security?Use local or self-hosted models (DeepSeek Local, Qwen, open-source)Continue\n2Primarily using JetBrains IDEs?Use JetBrains AI Assistant (supports multiple LLMs)Continue\n3Need a model optimized for GitHub workflows?Choose GPT-4o or GitHub CopilotContinue\n4Require large context handling for complex codebases?Claude 3.7 Sonnet or Gemini 2.5 ProContinue\n5Need cost efficiency for frequent queries?DeepSeek R1 or open-source alternativesContinue\n6Require enterprise compliance (RBAC, SSO, audit logs)?JetBrains AI Assistant, Harness, or GitLabContinue\n7Prefer minimal setup and fast onboarding?Managed cloud models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini)Continue\n8Working with multi-language or monorepo projects?JetBrains AI Assistant or GPT-4o.Continue\n\nDisclaimer: models listed reflect those available at the time of research conclusion and may not represent the most recent versions.\n\n\n\nSummary takeaways\nHow to choose an AI coding model:\nNeed control → local or open-source models\nNeed speed → GPT or Claude\nNeed compliance → JetBrains AI Assistant\nFocus on collaboration → IDE-integrated tools\nAlign your tool choice with your team’s priorities.\nNow that you have the right AI coding model, in the next section, we will answer the most common developer questions about AI coding tools.\nFAQ\nQ: Which AI model was most popular among developers in 2025?\n A: GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were the most frequently used AI models for coding tasks, according to the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025.\nQ: Are there free or affordable AI models for coding?\n A: Yes.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we build tools that help teams work with complex systems in a more productive and enjoyable way. As AI becomes part of everyday workflows, a new challenge is emerging for data teams: How can you enable AI-assisted analytics without sacrificing accuracy, transparency, or control over data?\nToday, we’re introducing Databao, a new data product from JetBrains designed to bring reliable semantic context to data teams, with the ability to build your own AI agents on top of it. We’re aiming to build an AI-native analytics tool that business users can rely on, alongside the dashboards that teams use every day.\nAs part of this work, we invite data teams to get in touch with us and launch a Proof of Concept to enable self-serve analytics for business users, discuss your team needs and share feedback throughout the journey. \n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nWhy Databao?\nDatabao’s mission\nModern data workflows are evolving quickly. Teams need flexibility and scalability as AI becomes a core part of how insights are generated. Sharing and reusing domain context, trusting AI-generated results, and scaling analytics without increasing complexity are some of the main challenges for companies.\nDatabao was built to solve practical problems that data teams face nowadays:\nEnabling business users to ask their own data questions in plain language.\nRelying on consistent, governed business definitions across analyses.\nGetting more accurate, repeatable results from AI-assisted workflows.\nReducing manual back-and-forth and ad-hoc requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, this means enabling personalized, self-service analytics that are controllable, scalable, and continuously improve over time.\nProviding a self-maintaining semantic layer for companies’ data\nDatabao’s CLI tool, the context engine, is designed to extract schema and metadata from data sources and give teams a governed layer that captures business logic and definitions from databases, BI tools, and documentation. This keeps context consistent and reusable.\nAs one of our Alpha users puts it:\n“Before the context engine, I had to copy and paste my database schema into the LLM. Now I just point it to the data source and ask it to generate a query – and it works. No more incorrect column types, format mismatches, or hallucinations.”\nEnabling agentic analytics\nIn addition to the context engine, the data agent, available as an open-source and local Python SDK, uses this context to enable users to query, clean, and visualize enterprise data, generating production-quality SQL and outputs that business users can trust.\nAnother of our early users shared: “The Databao agent joined three to four tables perfectly, which no other data agent can do. I’m literally happy with this.”\nThe platform that brings it all together\nDatabao is designed for teams and the people who implement and own data tooling: analytics leads, data engineers, and platform teams.\nIt starts with a simple local setup and grows naturally as usage and complexity increase. From the first open-source building blocks, we are now evolving into a team-ready SaaS layer that brings shared context, collaboration, and production-grade reliability.\nBy avoiding vendor lock-in, working across tools, and adapting to different organizational setups, we also aim to make our platform suitable for any production environment, not just for experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nDatabao’s trust milestones\nOver the past year, we’ve focused on understanding how structured context and a semantic layer can improve the accuracy of agentic answers. This research has informed the foundations of Databao and how we started building our product.\nAs a result, we recently reached two important milestones: achieving a first-place ranking in the DBT track of the SPIDER 2.0 Text-to-SQL benchmark – one of the most widely recognized evaluations for SQL generation – and joining the Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), an open-source initiative led by Snowflake and other industry leaders to define a shared, vendor-neutral standard for semantic models.\nLet’s turn AI analytics into a working POC, together\nWe are excited to invite teams to build a proof of concept together with the Databao team. We’ll work with you to understand your use case, define a context-building process, and give the agent access to a selected group of business users. Together, we’ll then evaluate the quality of the responses and overall satisfaction with the results.\n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nAnd if you’d like to explore Databao, you can already try both our context engine and data agent through our open-source libraries.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Anna Sulkina has always been a traveler, and we’re lucky her travels have brought her to Airbnb. Anna is a Senior Director of Engineering, and she’s responsible for Application & Cloud infrastructure. She brings over two decades of industry experience to Airbnb, including work spanning the stack from the frontend to the backend to the plumbing that makes everything come together. Anna is a mother, a passionate trail runner, and an accomplished leader. Here’s Anna’s story in her own words.\n\nDiscovering a passion after the Soviet Union\nI grew up in Eastern Ukraine, and the year I was graduating from high school, the Soviet Union collapsed. Despite the political turmoil, it was an interesting time to get into technology, and I have my brother to thank for that.\nI was always a nerdy kid, at school and at home, and my older brother really stoked that curiosity. He was studying computer hardware in Moscow, and he’d bring home computer parts to play with. I still remember the first computer he’d assembled, which required a cassette player to load programs. Only after many minutes of buzzing and clicking would the computer finally whirr to life.\nThinking back, that was really my first inspiration to work in technology. Seeing the inner workings of this new thing, a computer, and watching how the parts came together to form a whole — that’s what made me realize I wanted to work with computers, too.\nOf course, I didn’t know the Soviet Union would end, which made studying in Moscow impossible. But technology was still my future.\nEnglish: Harder than any programming language\nI got my start learning programming in a local Ukrainian university, and after four years of studying, I immigrated to America.\nWhen I arrived, I knew how to program, and I knew how to write and read English, but I couldn’t communicate well. I took ESL classes at a community college and, in parallel, enrolled in Berkeley Extension classes to advance my C++ knowledge and learn Java, which was still very new at the time.\nThroughout my first couple of jobs, I was more likely to run into challenges with the English language rather than with programming languages.\nMy first job was in computer hardware diagnostics at a tiny company with only five engineers, where we communicated directly with hardware manufacturers. This was right before the dot-com bubble burst.\nI almost didn’t get the job, though. The interview process for this job included a written portion that tested my knowledge of key computer science terms before getting to solve the coding problems. Given my prior education, I knew all the terms, but I ran out of time because the language gap slowed me down. Luckily, my interviewer happened to be taking the same Java class at Berkeley, and when I explained what happened, he gave me the chance to come back. I finished the test, got the job, and the rest is history.\nIn subsequent jobs, I transitioned fully from C++ to Java, which became my primary programming language for many years. I eventually got the hang of speaking English more confidently, but for a while, it still felt like Russian was my first language, Java was my second, and English was only my third.\nGoing deeper in the stack and taking on leadership roles\nAt various times, my career often felt all over the place. But looking back, I see a trajectory I wasn’t aware of at the time. I started with a brief stint in hardware diagnostics, but after that, I worked in the frontend and, over time, descended the software stack from frontend to backend to the deeper infrastructure I work with today.\nParallel to this trajectory down the stack was an upward trajectory in responsibility. Leadership wasn’t an obvious path for me at first — I had to be pitched multiple times — but the more I tried it, the more interesting and enjoyable it felt.\nWhen I worked at Caymas Systems, a telecom startup, my manager was quick to recognize my leadership potential. He was really encouraging, but even more encouraging was witnessing the difference between teams with good leaders and those without.\nAfter Caymas Systems, I worked at Comcast, where I eventually switched from an IC to an engineering manager. Once I experienced the joys of coaching people, building cool software together, and developing high-performing teams, I knew this was the path I wanted to take.\nFail whales and distributed systems\nThis path took me through a formative time in my career: the almost nine years I spent working at Twitter. I began as a first-line manager and, over time, worked through some of Twitter’s biggest events, including the “fail whale” era and the Ellen DeGeneres “selfie that broke Twitter” moment.\nThis was an exciting time. I was working at the heart of Twitter’s tech stack, supporting teams that powered its consumer and revenue verticals. This is where I grew into a senior manager and, eventually, a director. Looking back over nearly a decade of work, two major lessons stand out: one technical and one cultural.\nThe technical lesson was about failure — namely, its inevitability.\nOver my tenure, the Twitter stack transitioned from a monolith to a microservices architecture. This resulted in a set of robust, high-scale, low-latency distributed systems, and it was here that I learned that, when building resilient distributed systems, you need to design for failure, not hope to avoid it.\nI often think back to How Complex Systems Fail — the more complex a system, the more likely it is to fail. I remembered that lesson every time we were called to the Twitter command center to deal with an incident; it was all hands on deck until everything was back online.\nThe cultural lesson was about adoption and what it takes to fuel great ideas.\nToday, almost two-thirds of enterprises use GraphQL in production, but in its early days, it was a new, largely untested idea. During a hack week, a couple of engineers laid the groundwork for using this technology at Twitter. I worked closely with them and bootstrapped the team that eventually built Twitter’s GraphQL API, replacing the legacy REST services.\nI still think about this experience today. It required convincing leadership and building consensus across numerous teams and stakeholders, but once we did, the payoff was significant: this one technical choice accelerated the velocity of product feature teams across the company.\nWhy I picked Airbnb\nWhen Airbnb reached out in 2022, I realized my time at Twitter was coming to a close. By that point, my organization was well-run and high-performing — a success, but also a sign that I was ready for my next adventure.\nAirbnb immediately stood out because the company offered, for the first time in my career, a true alignment between my personal and technical interests. I love traveling, and I have been a long-time Airbnb guest since 2013. I had always wanted to work for a company that built a product I truly cared about, and this was my chance.\nI only got more excited when I learned about the people and teams I’d be working with. The Developer Platform organization, which was responsible for supporting all of Airbnb’s engineers, faced challenges I’d seen before. There was a lot of good work happening in silos, and folks were longing for a clear strategy and direction. Also, I saw an opportunity to not only improve developer experience but also build trust with the rest of the engineers and stakeholders.\nSo, I started at the beginning. We focused on setting up the organization, coaching leadership, and building internal alignment within the team, as well as external alignment across all the teams we supported. Fundamental questions like “Why are we here together?” and “Where are we going?” all had to be answered.\nAfter a year or two of this work, we had a high-performing team with a clear strategy and strong execution, consistently delivering business value and improving the developer experience and productivity at Airbnb. Even more importantly, we earned the rest of the engineers’ trust, and we enabled our technical teams to perform better.\nWe saw this reflected in the bi-annual DevX surveys (which we built out), and the results showed overall developer satisfaction increasing about 10% year over year during my time on the team.\nSolving new problems while working from anywhere\nToday, I’m Senior Director of Engineering for Application & Cloud Infrastructure, which includes compute, networking, core services, and the GraphQL application platform. Our mission is to deliver reliable, secure, and efficient platforms for building, operating, and scaling applications, services, and workloads at Airbnb.\nMy primary users are still the engineers at Airbnb. When they need to compute, they don’t wrangle AWS themselves — we provide a layer of abstraction that helps them use low-level infrastructure. Similarly, if they need authorization, authentication, configuration management, and a host of other services, they come to us rather than starting from scratch.\nI’m excited to come to work every day because of the people I get to work with and the opportunities we face together. The culture is excellent, the people are smart and collaborative, and the engineers we support appreciate the work we do.\nThe setup is empowering, too, and as you solve problems, you can grow and expand to tackle bigger problems that span teams and organizations. Add in the ability to work from anywhere, and for me, it feels like the sky is the limit.\nAs I look back on my career, and really, my entire life, I tend to see it now through the lens of long-distance trail running — a major hobby of mine.\nAfter working at a startup, having twins, and running my first marathon, I felt like I could do anything. At work and on the trails, I think about how to prepare for the journeys ahead and how to maintain a pace that allows me and the people around me to thrive in the long run. Recovery is necessary, but so is strategy, drive, discipline, and finding the people who will go with you as well as cheer you on along the way.\nI’m happy this path, as unpredictable as it has been, has taken me to Airbnb. Airbnb is in that ideal position between a startup and a long-established company. The systems and workflows are mature, but there are still many interesting problems to solve and opportunities to pursue. If that’s of interest to you, I encourage you to check out openings at Airbnb.\n\nMy Journey to Airbnb — Anna Sulkina was originally published in The Airbnb Tech Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Refactoring at scale is a time-consuming and error-prone process for developers. In large codebases, developers have relied on manual searches and incremental edits across multiple files to accomplish these tasks.\nModern development workflows depend on fast and accurate code navigation to avoid these pitfalls. When developers refactor existing code, explore unfamiliar areas of a large codebase, or make targeted changes, they naturally rely on IDE language service features such as Find All References, Go to Definition, and Go to Implementation to understand how code is structured and connected.\nAgent mode now has access to these same language-aware capabilities through the new find_symbol tool. This goes beyond traditional text or file search traditionally available in agent mode by enabling symbol-level reasoning powered by enterprise-grade language services.\n\nWhat is find_symbol?\nFind_symbol exposes rich, language-specific symbol information to Copilot Agent Mode, allowing the agent to reason about symbols (including functions, classes, interfaces, and variables).\nSpecifically, this tool allows Copilot agent mode to:\nView all references of a given symbol across the entire codebase\nUnderstand symbol metadata such as type, declaration, implementation, and scope\nThe find_symbol tool is available today in the latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders version 18.4. Supported languages include: C++, C#, Razor, TypeScript, and any other language for which you have a supported Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension installed.\nFor best results, write clear prompts and use AI models that support tool-calling. Learn more at AI model comparison – GitHub Docs\nExample scenarios\nAll examples below were showcased using bullet3, an open-source C++ physics simulation engine.\nAdding additional functionality to existing code\nAs applications evolve, you often need to enhance existing functions without breaking current behavior. This can include adding logging or performance metrics.\nThese tools help the agent quickly identify all relevant references, ensuring complete and accurate updates for feature additions.\n\nAPI Refactoring\nRefactoring an API, such as hardening it, requires deep understanding of how the API is consumed across a codebase. With symbol-level insight, the agent can discover all usages, distinguish between call paths, and propose safe refactors with minimal breakage.\n\nTell us what you think\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. You can share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, X, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn\n \nThe post Unlock language-specific rich symbol context using new find_symbol tool appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ai-slop-removal/\">Android Police</a>가 보도한 내용에 따르면, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠, 즉 'AI 슬롭'에 대한 대대적인 정화 작업을 벌이고 있다고 해요. 이들의 분석은 온라인 영상 편집 회사인 Kapwing의 2025년 11월 보고서에 기반한 것인데, 정말 놀라운 결과가 나왔습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">보고서 발표 이후 불과 두 달 만에, Kapwing이 선정한 <b>상위 100개 AI 콘텐츠 채널 중 16개가 플랫폼에서 사라졌다고 합니다.</b> 이 16개 채널은 총 3천5백만 명의 구독자를 보유하고 있었으며, 무려 <b>47억 뷰가 넘는 조회수</b>를 기록했었어요. 단순히 영상만 삭제된 경우도 있지만, 아예 채널 자체가 사라진 사례도 상당수라고 하니, 유튜브의 의지가 얼마나 강력한지 짐작할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히 눈에 띄는 것은 'CuentosFacianantes'라는 채널입니다. 595만 명의 구독자를 거느렸던 이 채널은 드래곤볼 관련 AI 생성 쇼츠로 2025년 말까지 12.8억 뷰를 쓸어 담았지만, 지금은 사라진 상태입니다. 이 외에도 587만 구독자의 'Imperio de Jesus', 421만 구독자의 'Super Cat League' 같은 대형 채널들도 함께 문을 닫았죠. 이쯤 되면 유튜브가 정말 작정하고 나섰다는 생각이 듭니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 인간적인 독창성과 통찰력을 더하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI는 데이터를 학습하고 패턴을 찾아내는 데는 탁월하지만, 고유한 경험, 감정, 그리고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 만들어내지는 못합니다. 여러분만의 시각, 분석, 혹은 개인적인 스토리를 AI 콘텐츠에 녹여내세요. 예를 들어, AI로 생성된 정보를 바탕으로 하더라도, 그 정보를 해석하고 독자에게 공감을 불러일으킬 만한 자신만의 서사를 추가하는 식이죠. 결국 사람의 마음을 움직이는 건 사람의 이야기 아니겠어요?</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. AI 사용의 투명성을 확보하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">유튜브는 2026년부터 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 <b>표시 의무</b>를 강화하고 있습니다. 이제 단순히 'AI가 만들었나?' 하고 의심받는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터 스스로 AI 사용 여부를 명확히 밝히는 것이 신뢰를 구축하는 핵심이 될 것입니다. 시청자들은 정직함을 더 높이 평가할 거예요. 저라면, 영상 시작이나 설명란에 '이 영상은 AI 기술의 도움을 받아 제작되었습니다'라고 명확히 밝힐 것 같아요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. '양'보다 '질'에 집중하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저품질 AI 슬롭이 넘쳐나는 시대에, 대량 생산은 더 이상 답이 아닙니다. 오히려 하나의 고품질 콘텐츠에 시간과 노력을 투자하는 것이 훨씬 효과적입니다. 좋은 프롬프트 엔지니어링, AI 결과물의 세심한 후반 작업, 그리고 인간의 검토와 편집은 필수적입니다. AI를 단순한 생산 도구로 생각하기보다, 여러분의 창의적인 비전을 실현하는 '협력자'로 활용해야 합니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">4. 커뮤니티와 적극적으로 소통하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">진정성 있는 커뮤니케이션은 AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 영역입니다. 시청자의 댓글에 응답하고, 라이브 스트리밍을 통해 직접 소통하며, 설문조사 등을 통해 콘텐츠 기획에 참여시키는 것은 강력한 팬덤을 구축하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 결국 팬들은 AI가 아닌, 여러분이라는 <b>인간 크리에이터</b>와 소통하고 싶어 할 거예요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.png\" data-origin-width=\"1344\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FdEEPEN%2FdJMcaiCdQcZ%2FrTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"지루하고 반복적인 AI 슬롭과 독창적이고 생동감 넘치는 고품질 AI 콘텐츠 흐름이 명확히 구분되는 추상적인 디지털 시각화.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.png\" data-origin-width=\"1344\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">정리하자면, 2026년 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에서 <b>'질'</b>과 <b>'인간적인 가치'</b>를 더욱 중요하게 여기는 방향으로 진화하고 있습니다. 아래 표를 통해 'AI 슬롭'과 '고품질 AI 콘텐츠'의 차이를 한눈에 비교해보세요.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; overflow-x: auto;\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #dadce0;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead style=\"background-color: #e8eaed;\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">항목</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">AI 슬롭</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">고품질 AI 콘텐츠</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>주요 목표</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">조회수, 광고 수익 극대화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">가치 제공, 시청자 만족, 브랜드 구축</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f1f3f4;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>콘텐츠 특징</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">반복적, 자극적, 의미 없음, 독창성 결여</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">독창적, 통찰력, 고품질 편집, 인간적 감성</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>AI 활용 방식</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">생성 도구에 전적으로 의존, 무단 사용</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">크리에이터의 비전을 돕는 보조 도구</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f1f3f4;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>플랫폼 반응</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">삭제 및 채널 제재</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">긍정적 평가, 노출 기회 증가</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #dadce0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 25px; margin: 40px 0;\">\n<div style=\"font-size: 26px; color: #1a73e8; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 2px solid #1a73e8; margin-bottom: 20px;\">  핵심 요약</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">1. <b>유튜브는 저품질 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포했습니다.</b> 2026년 현재 수십억 뷰가 삭제되고 수많은 채널이 제재를 받았습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">2. 닐 모한 CEO는 AI를 <b>'표현의 도구'</b>로 보며, 유해하거나 질 낮은 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 강력한 조치를 예고했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">3. 크리에이터는 <b>인간적인 독창성, 투명성, 품질 중심 전략</b>으로 변화에 대응해야 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">4.

        "contentSnippet": "2026년, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠 '슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포하며 플랫폼의 질을 높이는 데 주력하고 있습니다. 크리에이터들은 어떻게 변화하는 유튜브 생태계에서 살아남아 고품질 AI 콘텐츠로 인정받고 성공할 수 있을까요? 단순히 AI가 생성한 '슬롭'을 넘어, 인간적인 통찰과 창의성이 담긴 콘텐츠로 시청자를 사로잡을 수 있는 핵심 전략을 이 글에서 자세히 소개합니다.\n\n\n요즘 유튜브 피드, 혹시 좀 달라진 것 같지 않으세요? 특히 로그인하지 않은 상태로 쇼츠를 보다 보면, 기이하고 반복적인 AI 콘텐츠들이 넘쳐나는 것을 느끼셨을 거예요. 아, 이런 걸 'AI 슬롭(AI Slop)'이라고 부르는데, 솔직히 좀 피곤하죠. 의미도 없고 재미도 없이 그저 조회수만 노리는 영상들이 너무 많아서, 저조차도 가끔은 피로감을 느끼곤 했습니다.\n그런데 2026년인 지금, 유튜브가 이 'AI 슬롭'과의 전면전을 선포했습니다. 제가 볼 때는, 이건 단순히 플랫폼의 정화 작업을 넘어 크리에이터들에게는 정말 중요한 변화의 시그널이에요. 과거에는 양으로 승부하는 시대였다면, 이제는 질과 진정성이 훨씬 더 중요해진 거죠. 대체 유튜브가 왜 이런 결정을 내렸고, 우리는 어떻게 이 변화에 발맞춰 나가야 할까요?\n⚔️ 유튜브, 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포하다\n최근 Android Police가 보도한 내용에 따르면, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠, 즉 'AI 슬롭'에 대한 대대적인 정화 작업을 벌이고 있다고 해요. 이들의 분석은 온라인 영상 편집 회사인 Kapwing의 2025년 11월 보고서에 기반한 것인데, 정말 놀라운 결과가 나왔습니다.\n보고서 발표 이후 불과 두 달 만에, Kapwing이 선정한 상위 100개 AI 콘텐츠 채널 중 16개가 플랫폼에서 사라졌다고 합니다. 이 16개 채널은 총 3천5백만 명의 구독자를 보유하고 있었으며, 무려 47억 뷰가 넘는 조회수를 기록했었어요. 단순히 영상만 삭제된 경우도 있지만, 아예 채널 자체가 사라진 사례도 상당수라고 하니, 유튜브의 의지가 얼마나 강력한지 짐작할 수 있습니다.\n특히 눈에 띄는 것은 'CuentosFacianantes'라는 채널입니다. 595만 명의 구독자를 거느렸던 이 채널은 드래곤볼 관련 AI 생성 쇼츠로 2025년 말까지 12.8억 뷰를 쓸어 담았지만, 지금은 사라진 상태입니다. 이 외에도 587만 구독자의 'Imperio de Jesus', 421만 구독자의 'Super Cat League' 같은 대형 채널들도 함께 문을 닫았죠. 이쯤 되면 유튜브가 정말 작정하고 나섰다는 생각이 듭니다.\n  'AI 슬롭(AI Slop)'이란?\n의미 있는 내용이나 독창성 없이 단순히 AI 도구를 이용해 대량으로 생성된, 저품질의 반복적이고 자극적인 콘텐츠를 지칭합니다. 주로 조회수나 광고 수익만을 목적으로 하며, 시청자에게 피로감만 안겨주는 경우가 많아요.\n\n\n  모한 CEO의 2026년 비전: AI, 도구인가 대체재인가?\n유튜브의 이러한 움직임은 닐 모한(Neal Mohan) CEO의 비전과 정확히 일치합니다. 그는 2026년 1월 21일 발표한 '2026년 유튜브의 비전'이라는 글에서 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 회사의 입장을 명확히 밝혔어요.\n모한 CEO는 AI가 창의적인 사람들에게 엄청난 기회가 될 것이라고 말하며, 포토샵이나 CGI 같은 도구에 비유했습니다. \"AI는 표현을 위한 도구이지, 인간을 대체하는 것이 아니다\"라고 강조했죠. 저도 이 말에 정말 공감하는데요, 결국 기술은 사람이 어떻게 쓰느냐에 따라 달라지는 것 아니겠어요?\n하지만 그는 AI 콘텐츠의 위험성도 동시에 지적했습니다. 진짜 영상과 AI 생성 영상을 구별하기 어려워지는 현실을 우려하며, \"커뮤니티 가이드라인을 위반하는 유해한 합성 미디어를 제거하고, 딥페이크를 식별하고 차단하는 도구를 크리에이터에게 제공할 것\"이라고 밝혔습니다. 이는 창의성을 존중하되, 윤리적 책임도 다하겠다는 유튜브의 강한 의지를 보여주는 대목이죠.\n특히 흥미로웠던 점은 그가 직접 'AI 슬롭 관리(Managing AI slop)'라는 섹션을 만들었다는 거예요. 모한 CEO는 유튜브의 목표가 '자유로운 표현의 장'인 동시에 '사람들이 시간을 보내면서 기분 좋게 느낄 수 있는 곳'이라고 말했습니다. 이를 위해 \"저품질 AI 콘텐츠의 확산을 줄이기 위해 스팸 및 클릭베이트 퇴치에 성공했던 기존 시스템을 적극적으로 활용하고 있다\"고 덧붙였죠.\n결론적으로 유튜브는 AI 생성 콘텐츠 자체를 반대하는 것이 아니라, 의미 없고 반복적이며 질 낮은 '슬롭'을 근절하겠다는 분명한 선을 그은 것입니다. 이는 유튜브 사용자 모두에게 좋은 소식일 뿐만 아니라, 앞으로 AI 콘텐츠를 제작하려는 크리에이터들에게도 명확한 가이드라인이 될 것이라고 생각합니다.\n⚠️ 경고: AI 콘텐츠 제작 시 유의할 점!\n유튜브는 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 투명성 의무를 강화하고 있습니다. 콘텐츠가 AI에 의해 변경되었거나 생성된 경우, 이를 명확히 밝히지 않으면 불이익을 받을 수 있습니다. 항상 유튜브의 커뮤니티 가이드라인을 준수해주세요.\n  고품질 AI 콘텐츠를 위한 크리에이터 생존 전략\n그렇다면 우리는 이 변화의 물결 속에서 어떻게 살아남고, 심지어 더 큰 기회를 만들 수 있을까요? 제 생각에는, 결국 '인간적인 터치'와 '가치 전달'에 달려 있다고 봅니다. 단순히 AI가 뽑아낸 결과물을 그대로 올리는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터의 역할이 더욱 중요해지는 시점이죠. 다음은 제가 제안하는 고품질 AI 콘텐츠 생존 전략입니다.\n1. 인간적인 독창성과 통찰력을 더하라\nAI는 데이터를 학습하고 패턴을 찾아내는 데는 탁월하지만, 고유한 경험, 감정, 그리고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 만들어내지는 못합니다. 여러분만의 시각, 분석, 혹은 개인적인 스토리를 AI 콘텐츠에 녹여내세요. 예를 들어, AI로 생성된 정보를 바탕으로 하더라도, 그 정보를 해석하고 독자에게 공감을 불러일으킬 만한 자신만의 서사를 추가하는 식이죠. 결국 사람의 마음을 움직이는 건 사람의 이야기 아니겠어요?\n2. AI 사용의 투명성을 확보하라\n유튜브는 2026년부터 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 표시 의무를 강화하고 있습니다. 이제 단순히 'AI가 만들었나?' 하고 의심받는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터 스스로 AI 사용 여부를 명확히 밝히는 것이 신뢰를 구축하는 핵심이 될 것입니다. 시청자들은 정직함을 더 높이 평가할 거예요. 저라면, 영상 시작이나 설명란에 '이 영상은 AI 기술의 도움을 받아 제작되었습니다'라고 명확히 밝힐 것 같아요.\n3. '양'보다 '질'에 집중하라\n저품질 AI 슬롭이 넘쳐나는 시대에, 대량 생산은 더 이상 답이 아닙니다. 오히려 하나의 고품질 콘텐츠에 시간과 노력을 투자하는 것이 훨씬 효과적입니다. 좋은 프롬프트 엔지니어링, AI 결과물의 세심한 후반 작업, 그리고 인간의 검토와 편집은 필수적입니다. AI를 단순한 생산 도구로 생각하기보다, 여러분의 창의적인 비전을 실현하는 '협력자'로 활용해야 합니다.\n4. 커뮤니티와 적극적으로 소통하라\n진정성 있는 커뮤니케이션은 AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 영역입니다. 시청자의 댓글에 응답하고, 라이브 스트리밍을 통해 직접 소통하며, 설문조사 등을 통해 콘텐츠 기획에 참여시키는 것은 강력한 팬덤을 구축하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 결국 팬들은 AI가 아닌, 여러분이라는 인간 크리에이터와 소통하고 싶어 할 거예요.\n\n\n정리하자면, 2026년 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에서 '질'과 '인간적인 가치'를 더욱 중요하게 여기는 방향으로 진화하고 있습니다. 아래 표를 통해 'AI 슬롭'과 '고품질 AI 콘텐츠'의 차이를 한눈에 비교해보세요.\n항목\nAI 슬롭\n고품질 AI 콘텐츠\n\n\n\n\n주요 목표\n조회수, 광고 수익 극대화\n가치 제공, 시청자 만족, 브랜드 구축\n\n\n콘텐츠 특징\n반복적, 자극적, 의미 없음, 독창성 결여\n독창적, 통찰력, 고품질 편집, 인간적 감성\n\n\nAI 활용 방식\n생성 도구에 전적으로 의존, 무단 사용\n크리에이터의 비전을 돕는 보조 도구\n\n\n플랫폼 반응\n삭제 및 채널 제재\n긍정적 평가, 노출 기회 증가\n\n\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. 유튜브는 저품질 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포했습니다. 2026년 현재 수십억 뷰가 삭제되고 수많은 채널이 제재를 받았습니다.\n2. 닐 모한 CEO는 AI를 '표현의 도구'로 보며, 유해하거나 질 낮은 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 강력한 조치를 예고했습니다.\n3. 크리에이터는 인간적인 독창성, 투명성, 품질 중심 전략으로 변화에 대응해야 합니다.\n4. AI는 단순한 생산 도구가 아닌, '인간 크리에이터의 가치를 높이는 협력자'로서 활용되어야 합니다.\n*위 내용은 2026년 2월 12일 기준 유튜브 정책 및 시장 동향을 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 2026년에도 AI 콘텐츠를 유튜브에 올려도 괜찮을까요?\nA1: 네, 물론입니다. 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠 자체를 금지하는 것이 아니라, 저품질의 'AI 슬롭'을 제재하는 것입니다. 중요한 것은 콘텐츠에 여러분의 독창적인 아이디어와 인간적인 가치를 담고, AI 사용 여부를 투명하게 공개하는 것입니다. AI는 강력한 창작 도구가 될 수 있습니다.\nQ2: 유튜브가 'AI 슬롭'을 판단하는 구체적인 기준은 무엇인가요?\nA2: 유튜브는 공식적으로 구체적인 기준을 명시하지는 않지만, 닐 모한 CEO의 발언을 통해 유추할 수 있습니다. 반복적이고 의미 없는 내용, 조회수나 광고 수익만을 위한 자극적인 콘텐츠, 커뮤니티 가이드라인을 위반하는 유해한 합성 미디어 등이 주요 대상입니다. 또한, AI 생성 여부를 숨기거나 오해를 불러일으키는 콘텐츠도 제재 대상이 될 수 있습니다.\nQ3: AI 콘텐츠 제작 시 크리에이터가 가장 중요하게 생각해야 할 것은 무엇인가요?\nA3: 단연 '품질'과 '진정성'입니다. AI는 보조 도구일 뿐, 콘텐츠의 기획, 스토리텔링, 편집 등 모든 과정에 크리에이터의 인간적인 노력과 통찰력이 들어가야 합니다. 시청자에게 실질적인 가치를 제공하고, 신뢰를 쌓는 것이 장기적인 성공의 열쇠입니다.\n2026년, 유튜브의 AI 콘텐츠 생태계는 새로운 전환점을 맞이하고 있습니다. '슬롭'을 피하고 고품질 콘텐츠로 인정받는 것은 더 이상 선택이 아닌 필수입니다. 여러분의 창의적인 열정과 인간적인 통찰력을 담아, 변화하는 유튜브에서 새로운 기회를 잡으시길 바랍니다! 감사합니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "AI 기술의 눈부신 발전 속에서 우리 인류는 어떤 능력을 키워야 할까요? AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 5가지 핵심 특성과, AI와 상생하며 미래를 주도할 수 있는 새로운 마인드셋 전환에 대해 깊이 있게 탐구해 봅니다. 급변하는 시대에 흔들리지 않는 여러분만의 경쟁력을 찾는 여정에 함께해요!\n\n\n  AI 시대, 사라지지 않는 인간의 가치\n음, 여러분, 정말 놀랍지 않나요? 지금 이 순간에도 전 세계 수많은 직장에서 AI는 우리 일상의 많은 부분을 대신하고 있어요. 데이터 분석부터 문서 작성, 심지어는 복잡한 일정 관리까지, AI는 이 모든 것을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 처리해내죠. 그런데 여기서 정말 흥미로운 현상이 하나 나타나고 있더라고요. 바로 AI가 정해진 일을 더 빠르게 처리할수록, 역설적으로 인간의 고유한 가치가 더욱 빛을 발하고 있다는 점입니다.\n저 역시 처음엔 \"혹시 내 일자리도 AI에게 뺏기는 건 아닐까?\" 하는 불안감이 있었어요. 하지만 2026년 현재, 많은 기업과 조직들이 깨달은 건 AI 도입이 인간의 일자리를 없애는 것이 아니라, 어떤 능력을 갖춘 인간이 앞으로 더 필요한지를 명확하게 보여준다는 것이에요. 작년에 Workday가 전 세계 직원을 대상으로 진행한 설문조사를 보면, 무려 83%의 직원들이 AI가 오히려 인간 고유의 능력의 중요성을 높일 것이라고 동의했다고 해요. 세계경제포럼(WEF)도 2025년까지 65%의 일자리가 강력한 소프트 스킬을 요구하게 될 것이라고 예측했고요.\n그렇다면 우리 인간만이 가진, AI가 절대 대체할 수 없는 능력은 과연 무엇일까요? 오늘은 이 다섯 가지 핵심 특성에 대해 좀 더 깊이 있게 이야기해보려 합니다.\n❤️ 1. 공감 능력과 감정 지능\nAI는 감정을 진정으로 이해할 수 있을까요?\nAI가 할 수 있는 것, 참 많죠. 고객의 감정을 '감지'하고, 분노의 신호를 인식해서 특정 감정 상태를 분류하는 건 이제 식은 죽 먹기예요. 하지만 제가 겪어본 바로는, AI가 아무리 정교해져도 진정으로 타인의 감정을 이해하고 공감하는 일은… 글쎄요, 불가능에 가깝다고 생각합니다.\n챗봇이 \"안타깝습니다\"라는 문구를 보낸다고 해도, 우리는 본능적으로 그게 진정한 감정이 아니라는 걸 알죠. 기계는 우리처럼 희로애락을 느낄 수 없으니까요. 반면, 잘 훈련된 리더나 뛰어난 영업사원, 그리고 마음을 치유하는 상담가들은 상대방의 미묘한 표정 변화, 목소리 톤, 숨겨진 의미까지 포착해서 그 순간에 가장 적절한 반응을 보입니다. 바로 이게 진짜 '공감' 아닐까요?\n왜 AI 시대에 공감 능력이 더 중요해질까요?\nWEF의 2025년 보고서에 따르면, 직장인 82%가 AI 시대일수록 오히려 더 인간적인 연결을 갈망하고 있다고 해요. 특히 HR, 리더십, 고객 서비스, 교육, 의료 분야에서는 이런 수요가 정말 폭발적이죠.\n한번 이런 상황을 상상해볼까요? 어려운 구매 결정을 앞둔 고객이 있어요. AI 기반 챗봇은 아주 논리적이고 효율적인 답변을 척척 내놓습니다. 하지만 경험 많은 인간 영업 담당자는 고객의 불안감을 감지하고, \"아, 많이 망설여지시죠? 충분히 이해합니다\"라며 그 감정을 먼저 인정해준 다음 차근차근 설득하죠. 결과는요? AI 챗봇은 거래 성사율이 낮은 반면, 인간 영업사원의 성약률은 훨씬 높다는 통계가 있습니다. AI 시대의 경쟁력은 더 이상 데이터를 얼마나 빠르게 처리하는가가 아니에요. 고객이나 팀원의 감정을 얼마나 잘 읽고, 그에 맞춰 반응할 수 있는가가 핵심이 될 거라고 저는 확신합니다.\n\n\n\n  팁: 일상생활에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학 작품이나 영화를 통해 다양한 감정을 간접 경험하는 것도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n  2. 비판적 사고와 판단력\nAI는 데이터의 한계를 모릅니다\nAI는 정말 대량의 데이터를 분석해서 패턴을 찾고, 그럴듯한 결론을 제시하는 데는 탁월해요. 이건 정말 인정할 수밖에 없죠. 그런데 AI가 절대 할 수 없는 게 있습니다. 바로 그 데이터가 정말 맞는지 의심하고, 혹시 숨겨진 편향은 없는지 감지하고, 복잡한 상황에 맞는 최종 판단을 내리는 일입니다.\nAI 시스템이 어떤 권장안을 제시했다고 가정해봅시다. AI는 학습한 데이터 안에서는 이 권장안이 논리적으로 '가장 최적'이라고 자신할 거예요. 하지만 우리 인간은 다르죠. 비판적 사고를 가진 사람은 이렇게 질문을 던질 겁니다. \"이 데이터가 최신 정보인가?\", \"여기에 특정 집단에 불리한 편향은 숨겨져 있지 않을까?\", \"이 권장안이 다른 예상치 못한 변수들까지 고려했을까?\", \"과연 실제 현장에서도 통할까?\" 바로 이런 질문을 던지는 것이 진정한 비판적 사고의 시작점이라고 생각합니다.\nAI 시대에 비판적 사고가 필수인 이유\nMcKinsey 연구에 따르면, 2026년에는 AI 윤리 문제가 정말 폭발적으로 증가할 것으로 예상된다고 합니다. 자동화된 시스템이 내린 결정이 자칫하면 차별로 이어지거나, 개인정보 보호에 위협이 될 수도 있잖아요. 이런 문제들을 감시하고, 올바른 방향으로 이끌어갈 인간의 역할이 정말 필수적이라는 거죠.\n현재 AI가 데이터 분석의 절반이 넘는 51%를 담당하고 있다고 해요. 하지만 아무리 AI가 분석을 잘해도, 결국 누군가는 그 분석 결과를 검토해야 합니다. \"이게 정말 맞는가?\"라고 근본적인 질문을 던지고, 상황에 맞춰 최선의 판단을 내리는 것. 그것은 여전히 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 귀한 능력이라고 확신합니다.\n✨ 3. 창의성과 혁신\nAI는 조합할 뿐, 창조는 못 합니다\nGenerative AI가 그림을 그리고, 음악을 작곡하고, 심지어 시나 소설 같은 텍스트까지 써내는 모습을 보면 정말 대단하다는 생각이 들어요. 기존 패턴을 조합해서 새로운 결과물을 만들어내는 데는 능수능란하죠. 하지만 이런 AI의 결과물을 '창의성'이라고 부르기에는 저는 좀 위험하다고 봐요. 왜냐하면 AI의 모든 출력은 결국 학습 데이터의 통계적 최적화에 불과하거든요.\n진정한 창의성은 완전히 다른 이야기입니다. 예를 들어, 스티브 잡스가 음악 산업을 완전히 뒤집어 놓은 사례를 생각해봅시다. 그는 기존 음악 구조의 패턴을 단순히 조합한 것이 아니에요. 그는 \"음악은 어떻게 소비되어야 하는가?\"라는 정말 근본적인 질문을 던졌고, 그 질문에 대한 답으로 아이팟과 아이튠즈라는 새로운 패러다임을 창조했습니다. 기존의 규칙을 깨고, 세상을 변화시키는 이런 능력이 바로 진정한 창의성이죠.\n왜 2026년, 창의력이 더욱 중요할까요?\n세계경제포럼은 창의성이 2026년 AI 시대의 혁신을 정의할 핵심 요소라고 예측했습니다. 특히 R&D, 전략 기획, 신사업 개발 분야에서는 창의력 있는 인간 리더의 수요가 앞으로도 계속 증가할 것으로 보고 있어요.\n여기 재미있는 통계가 하나 있습니다. AI가 생성한 콘텐츠가 많아질수록, 역설적으로 '인간이 직접 만든 것'의 가치가 더 높아지고 있다는 사실이에요. 예술 시장, 패션 산업, 게임 개발 등 다양한 분야에서 모두 비슷한 현상을 보여주고 있죠. AI가 할 수 있는 것이 점점 더 많아질수록, 인간만이 만들 수 있는 진정한 창의성의 가치는 더욱 빛을 발할 거라고 저는 확신해요.\n\n\n ‍♀️ 4. 적응력과 회복력\nAI는 프로그래밍된 틀 밖으로 나갈 수 없습니다\nAI는 주어진 범위 내에서 정말 효율적으로 작동하고, 예상된 문제는 기가 막히게 잘 해결합니다. 그런데 말이죠, 예상하지 못한 상황에 맞닥뜨렸을 때, 빠르게 적응하고 완전히 새로운 방식으로 생각하는 일은 AI에게는 정말 어려운 일이에요.\n2020년 COVID-19 팬데믹을 한 번 떠올려볼까요? 세상이 갑자기, 정말 하루아침에 변했어요. 직장은 원격근무로 전환됐고, 고객의 수요는 급변했죠. 이 와중에 수많은 AI 시스템들은 학습 데이터에 없는 전례 없는 상황에 직면하며 혼란스러워했습니다. 하지만 우리 인간들은 어땠나요? 놀랍도록 빠르게 적응했습니다! 새로운 업무 방식을 배웠고, 새로운 도구를 익혔으며, 심지어 완전히 새로운 기회를 찾아 커리어를 전환한 사람들도 많았죠. 이게 바로 인간의 진정한 강점, 적응력과 회복력입니다.\n\"무엇을 아는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우는가\"가 중요한 시대\n변화의 속도는 정말이지 점점 더 빨라지고 있습니다. 기술 산업의 반감기(기술이 절반으로 쓸모없어지는 시간)는 지속적으로 단축되고 있고요. 이런 급변하는 환경에서는 솔직히, \"지금 무엇을 알고 있는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우고 새로운 것에 적응할 수 있는가\"가 훨씬, 정말 훨씬 더 중요하다고 저는 생각해요.\nWEF 연구에 따르면, 관리자급 직원의 65%가 적응력을 직원 유지의 핵심 요소로 평가했다고 합니다. AI는 기존 업무를 더 효율적으로 처리하도록 돕지만, 완전히 새로운 업무 영역으로 뛰어들 수는 없어요. 새로운 길을 개척하고, 불확실성 속에서 빛을 찾는 것은 여전히 우리 인간의 영역인 거죠.\n  5. 윤리적 판단과 신뢰 구축\nAI는 알고리즘만 따를 뿐입니다\nAI는 주어진 규칙을 정확하게 따르고, 프로그래밍된 원칙에 따라 아주 일관되게 행동합니다. 이건 정말 강점이죠. 하지만 도덕적 회색지대에서 섬세한 판단을 내리고, 복잡한 문화적 맥락을 이해하며, 무엇보다 사람과의 '신뢰'를 구축하는 일은 AI에게는 불가능에 가깝다고 저는 단언할 수 있습니다.\n윤리적 판단의 아주 중요한 예를 들어볼까요? 의료 현장에서 신약을 승인할지 말지 결정해야 하는 상황이 왔다고 칩시다. AI는 모든 임상시험 데이터를 분석해서 \"이 약은 80% 효과가 있고, 20%의 부작용이 있습니다\"라고 아주 명확한 결론을 내릴 수 있습니다. 그런데 우리 인간은 여기서 멈추지 않죠. 우리는 이렇게 질문할 겁니다. \"그 20%의 부작용은 생명에 치명적인가?\", \"이 약이 도움이 되는 집단은 누구이며, 고가의 약값이 소외 계층을 배제하지는 않을까?\", \"장기적인 부작용까지 충분히 고려되었는가?\" 이런 질문들에 답하려면 의학적 지식뿐만 아니라 윤리, 사회학, 인문학적 깊은 이해가 필요해요. AI는 여기서 한계를 드러낼 수밖에 없죠.\n신뢰가 곧 자산인 시대, 인간의 윤리적 판단이 필수입니다\n현재 AI가 모든 데이터 분석의 51%를 담당하고 있다는 것은, 바꿔 말하면 51%의 의사결정이 이미 자동화되었다는 뜻입니다. 하지만 Workday 연구에 따르면, 직장에서 가장 중요하게 여기는 인간적 능력 중 하나가 바로 윤리적 의사결정 능력이라고 합니다.\n신뢰는 어떤 조직이든 가장 기본적인, 그리고 가장 소중한 자산이죠. AI가 의사결정을 돕는 것은 맞지만, 최종 책임과 그에 따른 신뢰는 여전히 인간이 져야 합니다. 고객들은 알고리즘을 맹목적으로 신뢰하는 것이 아니라, 그 알고리즘을 설계하고 감시하는 우리 인간을 신뢰하니까요. 또한 전 세계 기업들이 직면한 'AI 윤리' 이슈는 차별 문제, 개인정보 보호, 환경 영향, 노동 문제 등 점점 더 복잡해지고 있어요. 이 모든 영역에서 우리 인간의 윤리적 판단력은 필수불가결한 요소라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  핵심 인사이트: AI 시대, 일자리는 '변한다'는 것을 기억하세요!\n뉴욕 타임스의 칼럼니스트 토마스 프리드먼(Thomas Friedman)은 이런 말을 남겼죠:\n\"AI가 너를 대체하지는 않겠지. 하지만 AI를 잘 쓰는 누군가가 너를 대체할 수도 있다.\"\n이 말은 정말 많은 의미를 담고 있어요. 제 생각에는 크게 두 가지로 해석할 수 있습니다.\n첫째, AI 기술 자체는 중립적이라는 거예요. AI가 어떻게 쓰이는지는 전적으로 우리 인간의 결정에 달려있다는 거죠.\n둘째, 앞으로의 경쟁력은 단순히 기술 하나만으로는 안 되고, 기술 + 인간 능력의 스마트한 조합에서 나온다는 점입니다. 기술만 뛰어나도 안 되고, 인간 능력만 뛰어나도 안 되는, 그런 시대가 온 거죠.\n ️ 2026년의 현실: 지금 당장 이 능력들을 키워야 하는 이유\n현재 많은 기업과 조직에서는 직원을 채용하거나 임금을 결정할 때, 기술 능력과 함께 인간 능력의 균형을 정말 중요하게 보고 있어요. 한 번 생각해볼까요?\n능력 기준\nA 직원\nB 직원\n\n\n\n\n기술 능력\n매우 높음\n평균 수준\n\n\n인간 고유 능력 (공감, 리더십, 적응력 등)\n평균 이하\n매우 뛰어남\n\n\n회사의 선택은?\n점점 더 B 직원을 선호하는 추세!\n\n\n\n왜냐고요? 기술은 정말 빠르게 변하지만, 우리 인간의 기본 능력, 그러니까 공감 능력, 비판적 판단력, 그리고 창의력 같은 것들은 시간이 지나도 그 가치를 잃지 않기 때문입니다. 오히려 그 가치는 더욱 커지고 있어요.\n당신이 지금 바로 해야 할 일들\n공감 능력을 키우세요: 일상에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학을 읽고, 영화를 보고, 다양한 배경의 사람들과 대화하며 시야를 넓히는 것도 좋습니다.\n의문을 던지는 습관을 가지세요: 주어진 정보를 무조건 받아들이기보다는 \"왜?\", \"이게 정말 최선일까?\", \"다른 관점은 없을까?\"와 같은 질문을 끊임없이 던지는 습관을 길러보세요.\n창의력을 개발하세요: 때로는 기존의 규칙을 깨어보고, 새로운 조합을 시도해보세요. 실패를 두려워하지 않는 용기가 중요합니다.\n변화를 즐기세요: 새로운 기술을 배우는 데 주저하지 말고, 새로운 업계를 탐험하고, 낯선 분야의 사람들과 네트워킹하며 끊임없이 성장하는 자신을 발견해 보세요.\n윤리 감각을 기르세요: 어떤 의사결정을 할 때든 \"이것이 과연 옳은가?\"라는 질문을 항상 던지고, 단기적인 이익보다는 장기적인 영향까지 깊이 생각하는 습관을 들이세요.\n  핵심 요약\nAI는 감정을 이해하고 공감할 수 없으므로, 인간적인 연결이 더욱 중요해집니다.\nAI는 데이터만 처리할 뿐, 비판적 사고와 상황에 맞는 판단은 인간의 몫입니다.\nAI는 기존 패턴을 조합하지만, 완전히 새로운 패러다임 창조는 인간의 창의력에 달려있습니다.\n급변하는 시대에 AI는 예측된 문제만 해결, 인간의 적응력과 회복력이 더욱 빛을 발합니다.\nAI는 훌륭한 도구이지만, 결국 그 가치를 극대화하는 것은 우리 인간의 고유한 능력임을 잊지 마세요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\nA1: 제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\nQ2: 소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\nA2: 네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\nQ3: AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\nA3: 창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\"}}]} \n  결론: AI와 인간, 경쟁이 아닌 협력의 미래!\nAI 기술의 발전은 이제 피할 수 없는, 우리 삶의 자연스러운 일부가 되었죠. 하지만 중요한 건, 이 기술이 결코 우리 인간을 완전히 대체하는 것이 아니라는 점입니다. 오히려 제가 오늘 말씀드린 것처럼 AI는 우리 인간만이 가진 고유한 가치를 더욱 선명하게 드러내고, 그 중요성을 부각시키는 강력한 도구가 될 거예요.\nWorkday의 글로벌 설문 결과도 이를 명확하게 보여줍니다. 83%의 직원들이 AI가 인간 고유의 능력을 더욱 중요하게 만들 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있었으니까요. 이제 우리는 질문을 바꿔야 할 때가 왔다고 생각합니다.\n\"AI가 나를 대체할까?\"\n라는 막연한 불안감 대신,\n\"나는 AI와 함께 무엇을 만들 수 있을까?\"\n라고 긍정적이고 미래지향적인 질문을 던져보는 거죠.\n여러분이 공감할 수 있고, 비판적으로 생각할 수 있으며, 새로운 것을 상상하고, 변화에 빠르게 적응할 수 있고, 마지막으로 옳은 선택을 할 수 있다면—이 다섯 가지 능력이 바로 여러분의 미래를 단단하게 보장해 줄 거라 저는 확신합니다.\n기억하세요. AI 시대의 진정한 경쟁력은 단순한 기술 지식이 아닙니다. 바로 인간다움, 그 자체에 있습니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "짐 발실리가 영화 블랙베리에 대해 자신의 입장을 밝힌 인터뷰 기사도 함께 보면 더 재밌다.\n\n박소령 대표님의 실패를 통과하는 일을 다 보고, 이어서 넷플릭스에서 블랙베리를 봤다.\n2시간이 너무 짧았다.\n더 깊게 이야기를 보고 싶었는데, 2시간 동안 십수 년의 기록을 담아두려니 생략된 이야기가 많아서 아쉬웠다.  \n아쉬움과는 별개로 마음에 확 와닿는 대화 내용들이 몇 개 있었다.  \n더그 프레긴은 블랙베리 특유의 분위기를 계속해서 유지하려고 하며, 그와 같은 생각을 했던 마이크는 점점 기업의 CEO로 변해갔다.\n베스트 프렌드이자 공동 창업자였던 더그 프레긴과 마이크 라자리디스의 대화다.  \n\n더그: \"저거 봤어?\"\n마이크: \"아니\"\n더그: \"짐이 영화의 밤을 없앴어.\n직접 할 배짱도 없어서 140kg 덩치를 불러서는 소리 지르고 다니게 했잖아.\n앨런을 해고하겠다고 했대\"\n마이크: \"... 일을 하긴 해야 해\"\n더그: \"이 친구들이 일주일에 80시간을 기꺼이 일하는 이유를 알긴 해? 가족도 못 만나고, 인정도 못 받는데?\"\n마이크: \"알지, 세계 최고의 휴대폰을 만들고 있으니까\"\n더그: \"그래. 그런가 보다\"\n\n스타트업에서는 일을 일처럼 보지 않는 문화가 많다.\n그런 문화가 성과를 최적화하는 데는 방해가 된다.\n그래서 조직이 커지다 보면 그런 문화가 점점 옅어지게 된다.  \n반면에, 새로운 시도는 그런 문화 속에서 더 쉽게 시작할 수 있는 것 같다.\n만약에 블랙베리가 일반적인 대기업으로 변해가지 않고, 위 문화를 유지했다면 아이폰의 등장을 어떻게 봤을까?\n분해하고, 해체하고, 모방하고, 시도하고 그러면서 자연스레 블랙베리만의 스마트폰을 만들어가지 않았을까? 생각이 들었다.  \n아이폰의 발표 이후 투자자들의 기대를 충족시키기 위해 마이크는 공수표를 남발한다.\n\n마이크: \"짐은 지금 워터루에 있어요.\n다른 얘기는 하지 않기로 약속했는데, 아직 완성 단계는 아니지만 극비에 개발 중인 기술이 있거든요.\n시제품이 나오려면 몇 주가 더 필요하지만.\n큰 틀은 우리 블랙베리에요.\n다만 여기 있는 키보드가 화면이에요.\n전체가 다 스크린이죠.\n대신 우리 제품은 이걸 누르면 그대로 경험할 수 있어요.\n달칵하는 블랙베리의 키감을 느낄 수 있죠.\n스크린, 키보드, 전화.\n감이 오시나요?\"  \n\n이 발표로 마이크는 버라이즌에 100만대를 판매한다.  \n그리고 몇 주 내 시제품을 보여줘야 하기 때문에 엔지니어링 팀에게 갑작스러운 요구 사항을 전달한다.\n\n마이크: \"아니, 아니야 잘 들어.\n스크린이긴 한데 내가 여기 쓴 대로 경첩이든 액추에이터든 다는 거야.\n화면이랑 몸체 사이에.\n그러면 화면을 누를 때마다 달칵거리겠지.\"  \n폴 스태노스: \"이걸 왜 하는지 궁금해요\"  \n마이크: \"지금 여기에서 그런 질문은 하면 안되지.\n'왜' 는 몰라도 돼! 알겠어?\n내가 하라잖아.\n내가 이걸 팔았다고, 알겠어?\n근데 누구야?\"  \n\n\"'왜'는 몰라도 돼\" 라는 말을 나는 몇 번을 했을까? 란 생각이 들었다.\n스스로는 하지 않았다고 생각하지만, 막상 또 팀원들이 보기엔 표현 방식만 다를 뿐이지 같은 뜻으로 전달받기도 했겠지?  \n해야 할 일을 당장 시작하기 위해서 설명을 하다가 나 스스로 설명을 포기하고 \"일단 해\"라고 얘기한 적은 없을까 기억을 많이 뒤적이게 된다.  \n마이크는 점점 거대기업의 CEO가 되어간다.\n블랙베리 초반, 팀이 풀지 못했던 엔지니어링 문제를 풀기 위해 데려왔던 구글 엔지니어링 팀장인 폴 스태노스를 더 이상 기억하지 못하기도 하는 장면이기도 했다.    \n이 장면이 특히나 기억에 남았던 것은 영화 초반에 마이크는 짐에게 핸드폰을 더 판매하지 말아달라는 부탁을 했기 때문이다.  \n현재 블랙베리의 완성도와 안정성을 위해 더 이상 판매하지 말고 물량을 조절해야 한다는 의견을 계속 피력한다.  \n그랬던 마이크가 이제는 공수표를 남발하면서까지 세일즈를 한다.\n납득할 수 없는 납기일과 사전에 얘기되지 않은 기능까지 요구하면서 결국은 고객이 등을 돌리게 만드는 제품을 출시하게 된다.  \n마이크는 자신이 만든 제품에 대한 자부심이 강했기에 후발주자이자 블랙베리와 완전히 대척점에 선 제품인 아이폰을 용납할 수 없다.\n그래서 같은 터치폰을 만드는 과정에서도 결코 '아이폰 같은' 이란 표현은 쓰지 않는다.\n병적으로.\n\n더그: \"정리하면 블랙베리만의 키감을 유지하면서 아이폰의 화면을 접목하면 돼.\n그게 다야.\"\n마이크: \"아니야, 그게 아니지!\n애플의 무언가를 접목하는 게 아니야.\n여러분 어려운 일이 아니야.\n돈을 많이 받았잖아.\n어렵지 않아.\n결국 키보드야.\n화면 위에 키보드.\n어떻게 생각하든 상관 없어\"\n\n\n조화로워보였던 짐과 마이크의 협업도 점점 서로간의 방임으로 가기 시작했다.  \n\n팀원: \"아이폰에 대한 소비자 기대치가 사상 최고를 기록했어요.\n세계 1위 휴대폰에서 아이폰 이전 휴대폰이 되게 생겼다고요.\"\n짐: \"괜찮아. 마이크가 해결할 거야\"\n\n\n\n마이크: \"증권 거래 위원회가 왜 우릴 조사해요? 스톡옵션 일이라던데\"\n짐: \"별일 아닐 거예요\"\n마이크: \"별일 아니에요?\"\n짐: \"그럼요. 애플 일은 어때요? 우리 위험해요?\"\n마이크: \"아뇨.\"\n짐: \"어째서요?\"\n마이크: \"기기당 데이터 사용량이 블랙베리 5,000대고 키보드도 없고 그냥 말이 안 되니까요.\"\n짐: \"다들 우리가 끝났다고 떠들어 대는데요?\"\n마이크: \"다들 멍청이거든요.\"\n\n서로가 서로의 영역을 모니터링하지 않았다.\n제품이 뒤처지고 있어도 \"마이크가 알아서 하겠지\"라고 생각했고,\n세일즈가 무리한 약속을 해도 \"짐이 알아서 하겠지\"라고 넘겼다.\n공동 CEO 체제의 장점은 전문성의 분담이지만, 단점은 책임의 분산이다.\n블랙베리에서는 그 단점이 극대화되었다.\n서로의 영역에 간섭하지 않는 것이 신뢰가 아니라 무관심이 되어버린 것이다.  \n만약 단일 CEO였다면 어땠을까?\n영업과 제품 둘 다 문제가 있을 경우 둘 다 CEO가 강력하게 개입했을 것이다.  \n각 분야별 C레벨이 있더라도 결국은 CEO가 최종적으로 결정을 내리는 구조로 갈 수밖에 없는 이유를 영화로 본 것 같았다.\n레딧에서 흥미로운 질문을 봤다.\n마이크와 짐 중에 블랙베리 몰락에 더 책임이 있는 사람은 누구일까?\n같은 회사를 이끌면서도 서로 다른 꿈을 꾸고 있었다.\n실제로 짐 발실리는 NHL 하키팀 인수에 집착하느라 회사 일에 소홀했다는 비판을 받는다.\n피츠버그 펭귄스, 내슈빌 프레데터스, 피닉스 코요테스까지 세 번이나 팀 인수를 시도했고, 모두 실패했다.\n2008~2010년 RIM에서 일했던 한 직원은 레딧에 이렇게 썼다.\n\n\"짐은 하키팀 사는 데 너무 몰두해서 시장에서 눈을 떼버렸다.\n나는 실리콘밸리에 살았는데, 아이폰에 대한 열광이 진짜라는 걸 봤다.\n하지만 RIM 임원들은 그걸 믿지 않았다.\"\n\n한편 마이크 라자리디스는 물리 키보드에 대한 자부심에 갇혀 터치스크린으로의 전환을 거부했다.\n아이폰이 2007년 6월에 나왔는데, 블랙베리가 터치스크린 폰을 내놓은 건 짐 발실리가 경영에서 물러난 이후였다.  \n상호 보완적인 상위 레벨의 구조는 \"역할 분담\"만 있어서는 안 되고 \"상호 이해\"도 있어야 한다는 걸 새삼 느끼게 됐다.  \n나와 대표님도 역할이 나뉘어 있다.\n대표님은 비즈니스와 전략을, 나는 기술과 제품을 담당한다.\n하지만 그것이 상호보완이 되려면, 서로의 영역에 대한 관심과 이해가 필요하다.\n\"저건 대표님 영역이니까\", \"저건 CTO 영역이니까\"라고 선을 긋는 순간, 우리도 블랙베리처럼 동상이몽에 빠질 수 있다.  \n역할만 나누고 이해가 없으면, 그건 그냥 분리일 뿐이다.\n블랙베리의 두 CEO는 역할은 완벽히 나눴지만, 상호 이해는 없었다.\n그래서 위기가 왔을 때 서로를 도울 수 없었다.\n기술 리더로서 비즈니스를 이해하려는 노력,\n비즈니스 리더로서 기술을 이해하려는 노력,\n이 양방향의 노력이 있어야 진정한 파트너십이 된다.\n그렇지 않으면 \"저 사람이 알아서 하겠지\"라는 방치로 이어지고, 결국 조직 전체가 무너진다.  \n요즘 회계 공부를 시작한 것도 그런 맥락이다.\n기술만 잘하면 된다고 생각했던 때가 있었다.\n하지만 대표님이 보는 숫자를 나도 읽을 수 있어야, 같은 그림을 보고 대화할 수 있다.\n서로의 언어를 이해하려는 노력 없이는 결국 \"마이크가 알아서 하겠지\", \"짐이 알아서 하겠지\"가 되어버린다.\n역할을 나누되, 관심은 나누지 말아야 한다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "미국 출장 중에 어떤 미국 VC가 혹시 스트롱이 이런 회사에 투자 관심이 있는지 물어봤는데, 이 분은 우리가 어떤 전략으로, 어떤 시장에, 어떤 조건으로 투자하는지 전혀 모르기 때문에 이런 딜을 공유해 준 것 같다. 희토류 관련 사업을 하는 미국 회사인데 현재 약 3조 원 밸류로 여러 VC와 이야기를 하고 있었다. 우리가 투자하기엔 너무나 비싼 회사였고, 분야도 좀 그렇고, 시장도 한국이 아니라서 듣자마자 바로 패스이긴 했는데, 그냥 희토류 시장 자체가 좀 궁금해서 여러 가지 질문을 했다.\n15분 정도의 대화를 통해서 알게 된 사실은 전 세계 희토류 시장의 90%가 중국에 있어서 우리가 이야기하던 이 3조 원 밸류의 회사는 남은 10%의 시장에서 사업을 하고 있다는 점이다. 그리고 더 충격적인 사실은 현재 실제 매출은 전혀 없고, 예약된 매출만 있다는 것이었다. 예약된 매출이란 중국과 미국의 마찰 때문에 미국 정부가 희토류 확보를 위해서 이 회사를 엄청나게 밀어주고 있어서 미국 정부로부터 부킹?된 매출이다. 나는 이 사업이 과연 잘 될지, 그리고 매출 0원인 회사의 기업가치가 3조 원이라는 게 말이 되는지, 도대체 이 회사에 이미 커밋한 투자자들은 누구이고 이들은 무슨 생각을 하는지 진짜 궁금하긴 했다.\n미래에 예약된(=부킹된) 매출이 발생하는 영역에서 사업하는 우리 투자사들도 있는데, 이 부킹이 된 매출 중 실제 매출로 전환되는 금액은 대부분 0이거나 매우 작다. 아마도 위에서 이야기한 희토류 회사는 미국 정부로부터 부킹된 매출이라서 전환율은 조금 더 높을 것 같지만, 현재 미국 정부가 하는 걸 보면 이 또한 불확실성 투성이다.\n이런 사업을 우리는 정치적인 사업(political business)이라고 한다. 상업적인 사업(commercial business)과는 완전히 다른 성격의 사업이고, 조금 더 쉽게 풀어 설명하면 제대로 된 사업이 아니라는 말이다. 중국과의 마찰 때문에 미국 정부가 밀어주는 분야라서 갑자기 떴고, 주목받는 사업이라서 이런 회사에 3조 원 밸류에이션에 돈을 쏘는 투자자도 있는 것 같은데, 갑자기 미중 관계가 좋아지거나, 또는 미국 정부의 희토류에 대한 기조가 바뀐다면 하루 만에 망할 수도 있는 그런 사업이다.\n한국에서도 가끔 이런 사업을 하는 창업가들을 만난다. 자생할 수 있는 기술, 제품, 서비스는 없고 정부의 기조 때문에 운 좋게 큰 계약을 하거나 큰 매출을 만드는 정치적인 사업이 실은 한국에도 꽤 많다. 워낙 한국 정부가 과감한 드라이브를 많이 걸고, 특정 분야가 뜬다고 하면 이 분야에 막대한 투자를 하면서 온갖 정부 과제와 보조금이 갑자기 생기기 때문이다.\n창업자나 투자자도 본인들이 하는 사업과 투자 검토하는 사업이 정치적인 사업인지 시장의 논리로 돌아가는 상업적인 사업인지 잘 구분해야 한다. 관건은 이 사업에서 정치적인 부분이 없어져도 자생할 수 있는 제품, 매출, 그리고 고객을 보유하고 있는 사업인지 여부다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 미국에 한 10일 정도 갔다 왔다. 짧은 일정이었지만, 꽤 많은 업계 분과 투자자들을 만나서 요새 미국 tech 시장에서 어떤 일들이 일어나고 있고, 우리보다 훨씬 큰 투자자들은 어떤 생각을 하고 있고, 어떤 딜들을 보고 있고, 어떤 고민을 하고 있는지 들을 수 있었고, 동시에 많이 배울 수 있었다. 내가 이 글에서는 우리 같은 VC는 창업가에게 엄청 많이 배운다고 했는데, 이건 배움의 절반에 대해서만 이야기한 것 같다. 나머지 절반은 우리가 투자할 수 있게 소중한 자금을 제공해 주는 우리의 LP들에게 배우는 것 같다.\n아무래도 미국 벤처투자자들과 가장 많이 이야기했던 주제는 올해 예정된 스페이스엑스, 오픈AI, 그리고 앤쓰로픽의 IPO였는데 이 세 회사가 원하는 기업가치 총액은 거의 $3.5 trillion이다. 스페이스엑스가 공개적으로 이야기하는 기업가치가 $1.5T인데 이는 한국 GDP의 4분의 3이다. 정말 어마어마한 숫자이고 나도 이 일을 하면서 꽤 큰 금액에 대해 이야기하고 billion이라는 단어도 가끔 말하지만, trillion은 입에 담기조차 부담스러운 단위이다.\n요새 이 시장에선 billion과 trillion이라는 단위가 너무 남발되고 있고, 내가 느끼는 걸 영어로 표현해 보면 “$100 billion is the new $100 million(이제 1,000억 달러가 과거의 1억 달러다.)”이다. 솔직히 몇 년 전만 해도 미국의 대형 VC를 제외하곤 대부분의 VC가 $10B 밸류에 투자유치를 하는 회사들을 상당히 부담스러워했다. 일단 한화로 15조 원이라는 기업 가치 자체가 너무 컸고, 이 밸류에 투자하면 정말로 돈을 벌 수 있을지에 대한 의구심이 앞섰던 것 같다. 그리고 너무 비싸다는 불평을 계속하면서 아주 꼼꼼하고 깐깐하게 실사하고, 여러 번 고민했던, 그런 시절이 있었다.\n몇 년 전에는 전 세계에서 가장 비싼 유니콘 회사가 Stripe과 ByteDance였는데 가장 고점을 쳤을 때가 아마도 $100 B 정도였던 것 같다. 이 시기에 두 회사가 시장에서 펀드레이징을 돌 때, 회사를 소개해 주는 기존 주주들도 약간 민망해하면서 딜을 공유했던 기억이 난다. 왜냐하면 본인들의 포트폴리오지만, 본인들이 생각해도 말도 안 되게 비싼 것 같고 $100 B이라는 금액 자체가 너무나 큰돈이라서 감이 잘 안 잡혔던 것 같다. 그런데 요새는 상황이 완전히 반대다. $100B은 마치 과거의 $100M 같고 – 실은 $100M도 우리같이 작은 투자자에겐 너무나 큰 돈이다 – 스페이스엑스의 구주를 $1T에 구매하고 싶다는 투자자들도 충분히 있다는 소문은 나에게는 꽤 충격적인 시장의 현실이 아닐 수 없다. 그 누구도 오픈AI와 앤쓰로픽이 $1T이라는 숫자를 이야기할 때 비싸다는 이야기를 안 하고, 그 비싼 가격에 사면 누군가는 더 비싸게 살 사람이 있다는 생각으로만 – 이건 전형적인 바보들의 이론이다 – 이런 비싼 딜을 바라보고 있다. 마치 요샌 그냥 이 정도 가격을 내야 한다는 생각이 기본적으로 깔린 것 같다.\n지금 우리 주위에서 일어나는 이런 현상을 어떻게 설명해야 할까? 절대 금액의 의미 자체가 희석되어 숫자의 인플레이션이 일어나고 있는 것 같다. 숫자의 인플레이션이 아니라면 정말로 이 세상에 몇 년 전 대비 돈이 그렇게 많아졌을까? 종이 상으로는 많아졌을 수도 있지만, 정말로 $100B이라는 돈을 마치 $100M 같이 취급할 정도로? “이걸 더 높은 가격에 사는 다른 바보가 있다면, 현재의 가격이 맞는지는 중요하지 않다” 전략은 거품 시장에서 우리가 과거에도 몇 번 봤던 현상인데, 더 이상 더 높은 가격에 사는 바보들이 없어진다면 – 그리고 생각보다 빨리 없어질 수도 있다 – 이야기의 결말은 해피 엔딩이 아닐 것이다. 특히나 금액이 이렇게 커진 상황에서 시장이 무너지면 정말 전세계적인 재앙이 될 것이다.\n물론, 미국이라는 나라는 한국보다 GDP가 15배나 높은, 비교할 수 없을 정도의 강대국이다. 그래도 미국의 로켓 회사 하나, 그리고 두 개의 AI 회사의 총 기업가치가 전세계에서 13번째로 잘사는 나라인 대한민국 GDP의 거의 두 배라는 건 잘 모르겠다. 내가 걱정하는 이 재앙이 제발 오지 않았으면.",

'투자의 힘을 모두에게.' 국내에서 증명한 방식을 글로벌로 확장하고, 소수의 전유물이었던 자산관리를 누구나 접근할 수 있는 영역으로 만들겠다는 비전이었죠. 매출 규모를 키우는 것보다 매출의 질을 높이는 것, 투자라는 영역 전체를 토스증권의 무대로 만들겠다는 포부가 담겨 있었습니다.\n\n”뱅킹의 본질로 돌아가다”\n— 토스뱅크 리더 이은미 \n은미 님은 토스뱅크가 이룬 성과를 나열하기에 앞서 \"기술이 이렇게 발전했는데도, 왜 뱅킹은 여전히 어렵고 불편할까?\"라는 질문을 던졌습니다. 이 질문을 통해 토스뱅크가 추구해온 뱅킹의 본질이 무엇인지 다시 돌아보게 된다고 했습니다.\n\n이에 대해 은미 님이 제안하는 방향은 분명했습니다. 뱅킹의 본질은 사람들에게 금융 자원을 온전히 다룰 힘을 주는 것. 개인이든 사업자든, 현금이든 디지털 화폐든, 형태와 관계없이 고객이 더 나은 선택을 할 수 있도록 돕는 일이라는 것이죠. 그래서 앞으로 토스뱅크는 이 본질을 더 정확하고 완전하게 구현하는 데 집중한다고 했습니다. 금융을 향한 모든 질문이 사라질 때까지요.\n\n”Tax를 넘어 Income으로”\n— 토스인컴 리더 최성희 \n2025년 토스인컴은 '숨은 환급액 찾기'를 중심으로 빠르게 성장했습니다. 성희 님은 유입 고객 수, 신고 전환율, 유저당 결제액이라는 세 가지 핵심 지표를 개선해온 과정을 짚었어요. 서비스 성장의 레버가 되는 지표에 집중했던 것이, 더 많은 유저에게 더 많은 환급액을 돌려주는 결과로 이어졌다는 설명이었습니다.\n이어서 토스인컴은 앞으로 ‘세금’을 넘어 ‘소득 전체’를 다루는 서비스로 확장하겠다는 비전을 제시했어요. 개인의 세금은 물론, 사업자의 매출과 비용까지 아우르며 소득이 발생하는 순간부터 세금으로 이어지는 전 과정을 더 쉽고 단순하게 만들겠다는 목표입니다. 토스인컴이 소득이 있는 모두에게 꼭 필요한 서비스가 될 때까지요.\n\n“We make the way”\n— 토스플레이스 리더 최재호\n토스플레이스는 빠르게 성장하고 있습니다. 어느덧 전국 가맹점은 28만 개를 넘어섰고* 오프라인 인프라 중에서도 손꼽히는 속도를 만들었죠. 재호 님은 이 성장은 가맹점 운영 전체의 과정을 이해하려고 한 덕분이라고 했습니다. 단순히 단말기를 빠르게 보급하는 데서 멈추지 않고, 가맹점의 하루를 처음부터 끝까지 세부적으로 설계한 선택이 쌓인 결과라는 이야기였습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 2026년 2월 기준\n재호 님은 앞으로 토스플레이스가 POS*를 하나의 기능이 아니라, 가맹점 운영을 떠받치는 플랫폼으로 만들 것이라고 강조했어요. 결제부터 재고, 직원, 매출 데이터까지 한 흐름으로 연결하고, 현장의 기준을 바꾸겠다는 거죠. 재호 님은 이를 두고 \"길이 없으면, 우리가 만든다\"고 표현했어요. 앞으로도 토스플레이스만의 유니크한 길을 만들어 갈 것이라는 자신감 넘치는 메시지였습니다.\n* 매장 주문·결제·매출 관리 서비스\n\n“One & Only”\n— 토스페이먼츠 리더 임한욱\n2025년 토스페이먼츠는 분명한 변화를 만들었습니다. 오랜 시간 이어졌던 구조를 정리하고, 사업의 체질을 하나씩 바꿔나갔죠. 한욱 님은 이 변화가 ‘Focus on Impact’ 라는 토스의 핵심 가치에 집중하고 반복해온 덕분이라고 강조했습니다.\n토스페이먼츠는 많은 것을 동시에 진행하려 하지 않았습니다. 가맹점 경험을 중심에 두고, 결제의 흐름을 단순하게 만들며, 시스템을 하나의 방식으로 묶어가는 선택을 이어왔죠. 한욱 님은 이를 'One & Only 전략'이라고 설명했습니다. 토스페이먼츠의 Way to Win은 남들과 비슷해지기보다 하나의 방향을 끝까지 밀고 나간 것에 있었습니다.\n\n“성공의 시간축을 '될 때까지'로 세팅한다”\n— 토스인슈어런스 리더 조병익\n병익 님이 정의하는 보험의 본질은 명확합니다. 위험이 닥치기 전에 최소한의 선택지는 남겨두는 것. 그래서 토스인슈어런스는 고객이 선택한 선택지가 최선의 선택이 될 수 있도록 설계사를 빠르게 늘리면서도, 퀄리티를 잃지 않는 데 집중하고 있습니다.\n병익 님은 보험을 '시간의 게임'이라고 표현했습니다. 국내 보험 시장은 연간 200조 원이 넘는 규모의 거대한 시장*이지만, 새로운 시도가 쉽지 않고 변화의 속도도 느린 곳입니다. 그렇기 때문에 토스인슈어런스는 단기 성과보다, 얼마나 오래 버티며 제대로 해낼 수 있는지를 먼저 고민한다고 말했습니다. 병익 님은 이를 두고 '성공의 시간축을 될 때까지로 설정하면 되는 일'이라고 표현했는데요. 보험이 꼭 필요한 순간에 외면 받는 고객이 없도록 토스인슈어런스가 계속 나아가겠다는 약속이었습니다.\n* 자료: 보험연구원\n\n”Back to Basics, 만족을 향한 집요함”\n— 토스CX 리더 강진석 \n2025년 토스CX는 지금의 방식으로도 상담을 계속 이어갈 수 있을지, 이 구조가 앞으로도 지속 가능할지에 대한 과제를 안고 있었습니다. 진석 님은 이를 '생존의 문제'라고 표현했죠. 이 과제는 토스CX가 해온 모든 가정을 다시 점검하게 만들었습니다. 그 결과, 더 많은 것을 시도하기보다 무엇이 정말 중요한지부터 다시 정의하는 선택을 했다고 말했습니다.\n\"We're not going to do anything fancy.\" 진석 님은 NBA를 대표하는 전설적인 감독 그렉 포포비치 감독의 말을 인용했습니다. 화려한 전략 대신 탄탄한 기본기를 강조한 철학이죠. 이 말과 함께 토스CX가 커뮤니티 전체의 성장을 함께 떠받치는 파트너가 되겠다고 했습니다. 상담의 품질과 속도, 비용의 균형을 지키며 고객 만족을 향해 나아가는 토스CX의 기본을 끝까지 지켜내겠다는 선언이었습니다.\n\n2026년 상반기 얼라인먼트 위크에서는 Way to Win이라는 슬로건 아래 지난 학기의 성과와 실패를 공유하고, 앞으로의 방향을 함께 확인하며 원팀으로 뭉칠 수 있었습니다. \n토스팀의 실험과 도전은 지금 이 순간에도 이어지고 있습니다. 그리고 이 과정에서 쌓이는 이야기들은 다음 얼라인먼트 위크에서 다시 펼쳐질 겁니다. 언제나 그랬듯이요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n얼라인먼트 위크는 반년마다 열리는 토스 커뮤니티의 가장 큰 이벤트입니다. 일주일간 이어지는 이 행사에서는 전 계열사 팀원들이 함께 지난 6개월을 돌아보고, 다가올 여정의 방향을 함께 나눕니다.\n\n얼라인먼트 위크에서는 성과뿐만 아니라 실패와 시행착오, 그 과정에서 얻은 인사이트까지 솔직하게 공유하는 자리를 가져요. 이 과정을 통해 각자의 영역에서 서로 다른 문제를 풀고 있지만, 결국에는 모두가 하나의 목표를 향하고 있다는 사실을 다시금 확인하죠.\n\n토스팀의 얼라인먼트 위크에 대해 더 잘 알고 싶다면 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}이 아티클을 통해 자세히 확인할 수 있어요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Photo 이욱영",
