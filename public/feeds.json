        "content:encodedSnippet": "Over the past 5 years, we’ve had many incredible opportunities to engage with game developers. From AAA studios to indie developers, the passion for slashing iteration times is significant. Amidst all the fantastic feedback we’ve received for Visual Studio, one sentiment has rung loud and clear: a desire to debug optimized C++ code without sacrificing performance. Although game developers have voiced this need the loudest, we know that solving this issue will benefit many other C++ workflows. While we’ve consistently rolled out many productivity and performance enhancements over the years, debugging optimized code has always been at the top of everyone’s wish list.\nCurrent Issues with Debugging Optimized Code\nThrough our conversations with game developers, we’ve heard about some common problems when debugging optimized code:\nTrying to inspect locals often yields the “Variable is optimized away” message in the watch window.\nStep-over and step-into don’t always step over, or into, the expected code paths.\nLosing time while iterating with #pragma optimize to try and undo optimizations, requiring a rebuild and restart of the debugger.\nThanks to your feedback, the team has been hard at work to come up with a creative solution.\nAnnouncing: C++ Dynamic Debugging\nWe are thrilled to announce that C++ Dynamic Debugging is now available as a preview feature exclusively with the MSVC toolset. This feature dynamically deoptimizes code that you set breakpoints on or step into, giving you the performance of optimized code with the debugging experience of unoptimized code.\nTry C++ Dynamic Debugging today in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 Preview 2.\nDownload\n\nWithout C++ Dynamic Debugging\nWith C++ Dynamic Debugging\n“The new feature is exceptional. I now have reliable stepwise debugging, variable inspection, and program counter jumping without needing to recompile with pragma optimize.”\n– Jess Kube, Principal Software Engineer, The Coalition\nUsing it daily, the new feature improved my ability to debug and investigate quicker. I don’t need to manually deoptimize my files anymore”\n– Matthew Koch, Principal Software Engineer, Halo Studios\n“With the new feature, breakpoints in inlined functions will now be hit. Previously, I had to use a debug build or #pragma optimize and remember to remove it before code review”\n– Keith Stockdale, Senior Software Engineer, Rare\n\nGetting Started with C++ Dynamic Debugging\nYou only need a few short clicks to turn on C++ Dynamic Debugging for your project. After activating these options, you must rebuild to start using C++ Dynamic Debugging.\nMSBuild C++ Projects\nTo begin, change your configuration to Release mode. Next, right-click on your project and click on Properties to open the Configuration Properties menu. In this menu, click on Advanced > Use C++ Dynamic Debugging > Yes. Lastly, rebuild your project.\nSetting this property will turn off Whole Program Optimization.\nConfiguration Properties\nOther Build Systems\nPass the new /dynamicdeopt switch to cl.exe, lib.exe, and link.exe\nFor Unreal Engine developers, UE 5.6 will support the bDynamicDebugging Windows platform flag.\nPlease see documentation for more details.\nSystem Requirements\nVisual Studio 2022 Version 17.14 Preview 2\nMSVC Toolset 19.44\nX64 architecture\nNot compatible with LTCG, PGO, OPT-ICF flags\nUsing C++ Dynamic Debugging\nTurning on C++ Dynamic Debugging and rebuilding unlocks familiar debugging patterns for optimized code without compromising on performance.\nBreakpoints\nYour breakpoints will get hit in deoptimized code. Look for the [Deoptimized] tag in the Call Stack window to know that you can view all your locals.\nConditional and Dependent Breakpoints\nSet Conditional and Dependent Breakpoints as if the code was unoptimized; you can add conditional breakpoints to variables that have been optimized away in your optimized binaries.\nStepping Actions\nStep Over to the next line of your source code as if the code was unoptimized.\nStepping Actions\nStep In to any function, and those functions will be deoptimized as well. In addition, Step In will now step into __forceinline functions.\nStep Into __forceinline functions\nSet Next Statement\nUsing Set Next Statement in a deoptimized frame works as if the code was unoptimized.\nSet Next Statement\nCall Stack Window\nIn your Call Stack window, you will see that any frames that have been deoptimized will have a [deoptimized] tag.\nCall Stack Window\nVisual Studio only deoptimizes the frame corresponding to your breakpoint or functions stepped into. Frames higher up in the call stack remain optimized for performance. You can select additional frames in the Call Stack window and click “Deoptimize on next entry” to deoptimize those functions when they are entered the next time.\n\nManaging “Deoptimize on next entry” breakpoints\nBreakpoints added through “Deoptimize on next entry” are listed in the Breakpoints window. You can export these Breakpoints for later use. To return your application to full optimization, delete these breakpoints.\nDeoptimized Breakpoints\nMiddleware Support\nWe have been working closely with our middleware partners to ensure that C++ Dynamic Debugging works with popular middleware tools.\nUnreal Engine\nIn Unreal Engine version 5.6, Unreal Build Tool and Unreal Build Accelerator will support C++ Dynamic Debugging natively. To try the feature today, please manually apply the change, temporarily disable Unreal Build Accelerator, and see our documentation for more details.\nIncrediBuild\nIncrediBuild 10.24 or later supports C++ Dynamic Debugging.\nFastBuild\nTo use C++ Dynamic Debugging with FastBuild, please see this Pull Request.\nXbox GDK\nOut-of-the-box support for C++ Dynamic Debugging will be available in an April 2025 update. To try this feature today, please refer to the official GDK documentation.\nOverhead Considerations\nWhile using C++ Dynamic Debugging, it’s important to acknowledge the following considerations. Despite these overhead costs, we are confident that your overall iteration time will benefit significantly.\nFile Output Size\nIn our assessments, using a modified version of the Lyra Sample project, we observed a 2.4x increase in the build output size.\nBuild Time\nEnd-to-end Build Time\nDepending on the project, we saw an increase in end-to-end build time ranging from 1.05x to 1.15x.\nIteration Build Time\nFor small and medium-sized binaries, the increase in iteration build time was less than 1.2x. For larger binaries, such as monolithic games, the increase was up to 1.8x.\nMitigations for Iteration Build Time\nIf the increase in iteration time is too burdensome for large binaries, you can try the undocumented /d2DDTrimInlines compiler switch. This switch, subject-to-change and removal, reduces the iteration time overhead from 1.8x to 1.4x at the cost of increased end-to-end build time. The switch also removes the ability to step into small __forceinline/inline functions.\nKnown Issues\nBy design:\nUnexpected PDB error, LIMIT (12), check for insufficient disk space, invalid path, or insufficient privilege.\nStepping in disassembly window remains optimized.\nFixed in Visual Studio 2022 17.4 Preview 3:\nCrash with memcmp and other intrinsic imports with /MD\nIncorrect emission of C4714\nMissing feature from x86_x64 compiler\nInstrumentation-based profiling doesn’t work\nCrash stepping past C++ exception catch handlers\nActive Issues:\nStarting the debugger with F10 or F11 keeps main() optimized\nImageBase is 0 when debugging\nCrash stepping into __try block that has access violation\nConclusion\nTry C++ Dynamic Debugging today: Experience the benefits of debug builds and the speed of optimized builds.\nDownload\n\nC++ Dynamic Debugging is a preview feature. Thank you to everyone who gave us feedback on debugging optimized code. This feature would not have been possible without your feedback. We love to hear how much time this feature has saved you and how you’re incorporating it into your workflow. Furthermore, we invite you to keep sending feedback so we can make C++ Dynamic Debugging even better. We truly appreciate your feedback and encourage you to keep sharing your thoughts and ideas with us through Developer Community, X (@VisualC), or email at visualcpp@microsoft.com.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe post C++ Dynamic Debugging: Full Debuggability for Optimized Builds appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Slow build times are a major headache for developers, especially in large, complex C++ codebases like game engines. Every minute spent waiting on a build is time that could be used to refine features, resolve issues, or push development forward. Activision faced this challenge with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II, where prolonged build times were slowing down iteration and impeding workflows. By leveraging Build Insights, they identified key inefficiencies, optimized bottlenecks, and successfully reduced build times from 27:49 minutes to just 14:25 minutes—cutting them in half. Read more about their journey in our detailed breakdown on Microsoft Game Dev.\n\nBuild times impact every aspect of development. When builds are slow, valuable engineering time is lost—time that could be spent improving features, optimizing performance, or debugging critical issues. Slow builds also create bottlenecks in our continuous integration pipelines, delaying the verification of every piece of code and content that goes into our games. To keep our development workflow efficient, we need our builds to be as fast as possible, and Build Insights provides that capability to our teams. — Michael Vance, SVP & Fellow Software Engineer, Activision\n\nThrough a collaboration between Activision, the Xbox Advanced Technology Group (ATG), and the MSVC team, optimizations were made to force inlining, linker efficiency, and whole-program analysis, leading to dramatic improvements in build performance. These insights not only benefited Call of Duty but also contributed to broader enhancements in MSVC’s LTCG and linker performance, positively impacting other major projects like Fortnite, Chrome, and TensorFlow.\nTo dive deeper into how these optimizations were achieved and how Build Insights can help your own development workflow, read the full article on How Build Insights Reduced Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II’s Build Times by 50%.

It’s packed with new features, including massive UI updates, a new Run in Docker build feature, and JetBrains-crafted recipes available in our Marketplace.\nUI updates\nIn line with our commitment to make TeamCity easier and more intuitive to use, this release introduces significant UI improvements:\nSimplified navigation: The Edit Project/Configuration button is now a Settings toggle, with distinct accent colors for View and Edit modes. Once you switch to Edit mode, you can navigate across multiple projects without exiting it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized settings: Project settings are now grouped into categories for easier navigation, while build configuration settings are arranged as tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefined layout: The headers of project, configuration, and build pages are now more compact, and build pages highlight key details like the repository branch, build time, and queue time. The Actions menu is now conveniently accessible via an ellipsis button next to Run.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing recipes (goodbye meta-runners!)\nThis release marks the beginning of meta-runners’ evolution into recipes. While the core idea remains, recipes offer new advantages. For example, you can:\nDefine them in XML or, in future TeamCity versions, YAML\nUse ones hand-crafted by JetBrains from Marketplace\n\n\n\n\nIn upcoming releases, we plan to add support for sharing your own recipes on Marketplace. Share your feedback and public recipe design ideas in the comments under this YouTrack ticket: TW-91941.\nEnhanced parameter control\nThe Parameters tab now separates input and output parameters:\nInput parameters are your standard pre-2025.03 parameters designed to be used directly by their parent configurations.\nOutput parameters are parameters with explicit access permissions, shareable with dependent configurations via the dep.<config_name>.<parameter_name> syntax.\n\n\n\n\nThis clear separation serves two purposes: enhancing security by keeping parameters that were never meant to be shared private, and allowing configuration developers to focus on adjusting their input parameters without worrying about breaking other configurations that import them.\nPerforce manual and automatic merge support\nTeamCity now supports manual and automatic code merges between Perforce streams:\nThe automatic merge feature supports configurations that use Perforce VCS roots.\nThe Actions build menu includes an option to merge changes to a target Perforce stream manually.\nImproved Docker and Podman integration\nVersion 2025.03 also includes a few updates that widen your options for running builds inside containers.\nYou can run all configuration steps in a single container using the new Run in Docker build feature.\nKotlin script build steps now support the Container Wrapper, which allows them to run in Docker and Podman containers.\nThe Docker Support feature is now called Docker Registry Connections, better reflecting its role in managing private container registry logins and image cleanup.\nThe complete list of implemented features and fixed issues is available in our documentation: \nWhat’s New \nRelease Notes\nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us in the comments below or via the support form.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This year, the TeamCity team is working on a number of new initiatives, including updating the UI, TeamCity recipes, Jenkins migration tools, and many others. Read on to learn what our focus is for 2025.\nModernizing the TeamCity Enterprise interface\nIn 2025, we’re taking a major step forward in enhancing the TeamCity experience. The modern TeamCity Pipelines interface is making its way to TeamCity Enterprise, bringing a fresh, intuitive UI to enterprise users.\n\n\n\n\nThis move aligns with our broader vision of making Pipelines accessible to all TeamCity Enterprise customers. Why? Because we believe it delivers value on multiple levels:\nSimplifies project setup. Getting started should be effortless, whether you’re a new user or an experienced DevOps engineer.\nEnhances the build chain editing experience. We’re improving how you configure and visualize your CI/CD pipelines.\nProvides YAML support. YAML is a popular way of configuring pipelines as code, and we want to provide this option to those customers who need it.\nIntroduces full branching support. Work seamlessly with feature branches, pull requests, and complex Git workflows to improve collaboration and automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned for more improvements as we continue updating the product UI!\nVCS integrations: UX improvements\nThis year, we’re focusing on redesigning the user experience to make it easier to configure connections, manage VCS roots, and streamline repository setup. \nWe’re also enhancing TeamCity’s integration with Perforce, GitHub, and other VCS roots.\nTeamCity recipes\nRecipes are reusable YAML-based actions that simplify build configuration by handling tasks like setting up tools, running tests, or validating source files.\n\n\n\n\nHow it works\nWhen adding a build step, you can search for actions that fit your needs (e.g. “lint”).\nTeamCity suggests matching actions, and you can then select and apply the desired action. \nThis feature will make the build configuration process faster, more flexible, and easier to share, as we’re planning to make recipes shareable.\nDependency cache\nTeamCity’s dependency cache enhances the existing build caching mechanism by automatically managing commonly used build system directories. Currently, you must manually specify which directories to cache between build agents within the artifact storage. \nWith this improvement, TeamCity will automatically detect and cache well-known directories for supported build systems, reducing manual setup and ensuring a seamless experience. This is particularly beneficial for teams using ephemeral cloud agents and TeamCity Pipelines, where maintaining persistent build data is crucial. \nFor now, the feature will support Maven, Gradle, and NuGet build runners.\nThere are two main benefits that the feature brings:\nSignificantly improved out-of-the-box usability, aligning with our goal of delivering a top-tier CI/CD experience with minimal configuration.\n\n\n\n\nMinimized end-user spending. By caching dependencies, you can significantly reduce build duration, thus reducing costs.\nImproving build feature usability\nMany important build features in TeamCity are hard to discover and configure due to their placement in the Build Features list. To improve discoverability and usability, we’re integrating build features directly into the execution page, making them easier to access and configure. \nThis update streamlines workflows while maintaining compatibility with plugins and the Kotlin DSL, ensuring a more intuitive and efficient setup.\n[Experimental] Jenkins migration tool\nJenkins remains one of the most popular CI/CD solutions. According to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report, 46% of respondents reported using it regularly in their organization.\nWhile it’s a great open-source product, it comes with its limitations, including a cumbersome UI, complex setup, and numerous plugins to handle – all this can be a hassle to manage. \nWe’re building a migration tool to make it easier for teams to switch from Jenkins to TeamCity. If you’re looking for a powerful CI/CD solution that supports complex workflows, this tool will help you migrate your pipelines without the hassle of moving everything manually.\nMeanwhile, if you’d like to explore how you can migrate your CI/CD projects from Jenkins to TeamCity, we can help! Please reach out to us via this form.\nDynamic pipelines: flexible build chains in TeamCity\nCurrently, build chains in TeamCity are static, requiring manual updates to build configurations and dependencies when changes are needed. While this works well for stable pipelines, it becomes cumbersome in scenarios requiring flexibility.\nFor example, if test suites are distributed across multiple build configurations, adding a new suite means modifying the build chain for all branches and ensuring the new configuration is disabled where it’s not needed. This manual process makes it difficult to efficiently manage dynamic workflows.\nTo address this, we are exploring the ability to dynamically generate pipelines at runtime, allowing build configurations to be defined programmatically based on branch-specific logic, test distribution strategies, or other dynamic factors. This would eliminate the need for rigid, pre-defined build chains and offer more adaptability for complex CI/CD workflows.\nSimilar to Jenkins’ Pipeline plugin, this approach could introduce a DSL-based scripting mechanism that allows teams to define pipelines in version control, ensuring greater flexibility and automation in pipeline execution.\nFollow our progress on YouTrack.\nEnhancing the Kotlin DSL with the K2 compiler\nKotlin is introducing the K2 compiler, a next-generation compiler that brings improved performance and new language features. One key benefit for TeamCity is the reduced compilation time for versioned settings, minimizing the delay between configuration changes and their application.\nTo leverage these improvements, we plan to adopt the K2 compiler for processing the Kotlin DSL. However, since K2 introduces some breaking changes, we will carefully evaluate its impact on existing configurations to ensure a smooth transition for users.\nReading configurations from Git for multi-node setups\nIn multi-node TeamCity installations, configuration files are currently stored on a shared disk, which introduces several challenges. Nodes simultaneously reading and modifying configuration files can cause consistency issues, and setting up a shared disk with acceptable performance is often complex.\nTo address these challenges, we plan to store and synchronize configuration files in Git, leveraging the existing repository used by TeamCity for tracking configuration changes. This approach will ensure reliable, conflict-free configuration management across multiple nodes while eliminating the need for a dedicated shared disk.\nAlibaba Cloud support\nWe are exploring Alibaba Cloud integration to expand TeamCity’s support for diverse cloud environments. This will enable users to seamlessly connect TeamCity with Alibaba Cloud services, improving scalability, resource management, and automation for CI/CD workflows. \nWe hope that the integration will be especially valuable for teams leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure for build agents, storage, and deployments, ensuring a smoother experience for users in the Asia-Pacific market and beyond. If you’re using Alibaba Cloud, we’d love to talk with you!\nAgent autoscaling\nTo enhance efficiency and flexibility in TeamCity, we are introducing agent autoscaling, allowing users to better manage cloud-based build agents. This feature addresses two key user needs:\nMinimum available agents. Ensures a baseline number of agents are always ready, reducing wait times, especially when agents have long startup durations.\nScheduled scaling. Allows users to adjust the maximum number of agents dynamically based on a predefined schedule, optimizing resource allocation during peak and off-peak hours.\nBy automating agent availability, this feature improves CI/CD performance, reduces manual scaling efforts, and helps teams control costs while ensuring builds run smoothly.\nTeamCity Pipelines\nAt the moment, TeamCity Pipelines is a lightweight, easy-to-use, yet powerful CI/CD product for smaller teams. It cuts your runtime by up to 40%, helping you build and deliver faster, thanks to smart features like the visual pipeline editor and optimization center.\nHere’s what we’re working on this year for TeamCity Pipelines.\nJob debugging: pause and investigate failures in real time\nDebugging failed builds often means reacting after the fact – opening the terminal and investigating what went wrong. But what if you could pause a job right at the moment an issue occurs?\nWith our new job debugging feature, you’ll be able to set breakpoints before or after specific build steps, making it easier to pinpoint problems as they happen.\n\n\n\n\nThis brings a more interactive debugging experience inspired by familiar concepts from IntelliJ IDEA, such as breakpoint toggling and a dedicated Debug button.\nIn the future, we plan to refine this further by allowing breakpoints within individual CLI script commands.\nMore VCS integration options\nYou can now build your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Git projects in TeamCity Pipelines. This year, we’ll be expanding VCS integration functionality to include the Commit Status Publisher and other powerful features. Stay tuned!\nPersonal notifications\nYou can now subscribe to receive notifications when a pipeline fails. Sometimes, however, you might want to receive more (or less) information about build statuses, etc. You’ll be able to choose the events that you want to be notified about, for example, when a pipeline fails to start, when the first build error occurs, and others.\nIntegration with IntelliJ IDEA\nWe’re working on a seamless integration between IntelliJ IDEA and TeamCity Pipelines. The integration will make it easier to manage CI/CD workflows directly from the IDE. Developers will be able to trigger builds and monitor results without leaving their coding environment. \nThis seamless connection helps streamline development, reducing context switching and making CI/CD an integral part of the development process.\nRestricting incoming dependencies for enhanced security\nTo improve security and control, we are working on a feature that will allow project administrators to restrict and view incoming snapshots and artifact dependencies for build configurations.\nThe new restriction mechanism will empower administrators to define and control which projects and configurations can establish dependencies, reducing security risks and ensuring better oversight of build relationships.\nThat’s it for now! If you have a feature request, please feel free to share it with us via this form.\nSubmit feature request",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Debugging computational notebooks can be quite frustrating for a variety of reasons, including issues like out-of-order cell execution, missing data files, and library conflicts. Traditional AI tools often struggle with these problems due to the interactive nature of notebooks, but at JetBrains, we are exploring new solutions.\nOur research team has developed a prototype of an AI agent that autonomously fixes notebook errors by modifying and executing cells until the problems are solved. \nIn this post, we’ll explore how the prototype works, how it improves the debugging process, and how it compares to simpler LLM-based solutions in terms of cost and user experience.\nWhy automate notebook debugging\nComputational notebooks are widely used for data analysis, research, and hypothesis testing because they allow users to integrate different data types and execute cells non-linearly. This creates vast opportunities for experimentation and use in data science.\nHowever, this flexibility and interactivity come at the cost of reproducibility and having to deal with frequent bugs. Studies show that up to 75% of Jupyter notebooks cannot be re-run without issues. At the same time, debugging them is particularly difficult, as it requires the interactive, iterative inspection of errors and their context rather than simple static analysis.\nUsing LLMs like GPT-4 is standard practice for other debugging tasks. However, for notebook debugging, it is rather challenging due to context size limitations. Notebooks require runtime information to reflect their state, which means they often need a large context window for error resolution. AI agents address this by interacting with notebooks iteratively – much like humans do, but significantly faster.\nThe JetBrains Research team has created a prototype of just such an AI agent for Datalore. It is capable of creating, editing, and executing cells to resolve runtime exceptions.\nHere’s a short demo showcasing the debugging AI agent in action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see a detailed report on this project, check out this preprint. These results were also presented at EMNLP, a leading conference for natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\nHow does the debugging AI agent work?\n\nLet’s start with a broad overview of our AI agent system. It consists of three main components – the LLM module, the environment, and the user interface – which work together as follows:\nStart: Whenever the execution of a cell results in an exception, the debugging AI agent can be called with a Fix with AI Agent button that appears below the error message. When clicked, it starts the agentic debugging cycle, which is shown as an interaction with an LLM in a separate window. \n\n\n\n\n\nCycle: At each iteration of the debugging cycle, the LLM module collects the required information and adds it to the debugging prompt passed to the LLM, in this case, GPT-4. The LLM then generates an answer, which includes some reasoning as well as the next action, such as editing and executing cells or finishing the debugging process once the error has been resolved. The action suggested by the model is then executed in the environment, and the results are added to the prompt for the next round of debugging. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinish: This iterative loop continues until the error is resolved or until the limit on time or the number of iterations is reached. In our experiments, most of the debugging runs ended in the error being successfully resolved after only a few steps, so the limits were rarely required in practice.\nHow does the AI agent prompt the LLM?\nLet’s take a closer look at the core of our AI agent system, namely, the LLM module. Our AI agent prompts the LLM using a “system prompt” that covers the general approach to the task and a “user prompt” containing specific details about the current stage of the debugging run. Below, you can see shortened versions of the two prompts.\n\nSystem prompt\nGeneral purposeYou are a coding assistant that should help solve the user’s error in a computational notebook. You should use functions to help handle real-time user queries and return outputs only in the form of valid JSON.\nAvailable toolsYou have a few ways of interacting with the environment:\nchange the code of the existing cells, run it, and give the output.add a new cell with your own code, run it, and give the output.run any cell as is and give the output.If you’re sure the error won’t show up in the cell where it was found, you can run finish.\nWorkflow guidelinesKeep trying for at least 10 steps before you stop, but if you think you’ve solved the problem, you can run finish right away.If you can fix the error without changing any code, do that. Don’t edit the existing code or add new code unless you really need to.Use only the functions given to you. If you have many functions to choose from, pick the one that solves the problem quickest.When you think you’ve fixed the problem, run finish to say you’re done.\nHacksJust adding try – except is not a solution. Commenting out the code that produced the error is not a solution. You should propose only meaningful solutions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial user promptHere’s a Jupyter notebook. It uses {separator} as a separator between cells. Note that cell indexes START FROM 1! {notebook} An error occurred in the cell with num {cell_num}. The error trace is the following: {error} Please resolve the error. You must use only the tools defined above to resolve the error. Return output only as valid JSON. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe system prompt opens with a general description of the problem, provides some guidelines on how it should be solved, and then closes with instructions about actions. We use reflection as the algorithm for choosing the next action, asking the LLM to reflect on the outcomes of the previous actions taken before selecting the next tool to call. The reflections are output as comments for each selected action and are available at all following steps. The guidelines also encourage the LLM to explore the environment and discourage large outputs and “hacks”, such as deleting the error cell or commenting out the problematic code. \nThe user prompt initially consists of the notebook code and the error cell number, again accompanied by a short task description. After each step, the actions suggested by the LLM are converted into commands and executed, and the result is collected as an input for the next user prompt, along with the conversation history.\nYou can observe the entire debugging process in real time via the interface where the conversation and the actions are visualized.\nHow costly is the AI agent?\nA significant cost with any AI system comes from running large language models, with costs primarily driven by the number of request and response tokens processed.\nTo compare costs, we evaluated the AI agent against a simpler zero-shot debugging approach in Datalore, using 100 hours of hackathon coding records. The dataset featured an extensive notebook action history, so the errors that occurred could be reproduced and addressed by either of the AI solutions. On average, resolving an error with the AI agent was 2.5 times as expensive, costing $0.22 per error with GPT-4 versus $0.09 with the simpler method.\nThe AI agent’s higher cost came mainly from using three times as many request tokens for its memory stack, while the number of response tokens was similar between methods. Nevertheless, the cost remained practical for industry use since input tokens are cheaper and most errors were fixed on the first step.\nUser feedback about the AI agent\nWe used the same zero-shot baseline to compare the user experiences with these two AI algorithms. In particular, we wanted to know how well users thought the AI agent resolved problems and how much they believed it could improve their productivity. We had two groups of programmers complete the same data-filtering task. One group used the zero-shot baseline, and the other used our agentic solution.\n\n\n\n\nWe found that the users were quite satisfied with both solutions, rating them either good or excellent, and they slightly favored the AI agent. The users also seemed to rely more on the AI agent. However, the participants also reported that the agentic solution was less easy to use. We suspect this may be due to the lack of user control over its actions as well as the speed at which it acts. \nIn the feedback, the users suggested that slowing down the conversation and highlighting the introduced changes in the notebook would provide more insight into the AI agent’s thought process and solution. They also proposed making the agentic solution process more interactive so they have a way of interrupting or changing the actions suggested by the AI agent. Finally, they asked for a way to access the agent before any error has occurred.\nBenefits of AI debugging: Looking forward\nFinally, we compared the AI agent to the unaided human debugging process that comprised our dataset. In this comparison, the agentic solution offers obvious benefits:\nFaster debugging: The AI agent typically fixed issues in under a minute, while humans took an average of 3.5 minutes and up to 20 minutes for more complex cases.\nEffectiveness for common small errors: The agent quickly resolved small bugs, like incorrect pandas functions or arguments.\nInsights into root causes: The agent highlighted and explained changes, which helped to identify root causes of and solutions for errors.\nThe main takeaways of the study for the agentic debugging research concern the areas of improvement:\nReduced cost: One solution to the higher cost of the agentic approach could be history caching, which can reduce the number of request tokens used. \nIncreased user control: The study of user experience highlighted that users would prefer to have more control over the process, such as the option to call the agent before any error occurs. \nBuilding on top of this work, we will continue making Datalore smarter with AI-based features.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve been following our journey, you might’ve read our recent blog post on the Complete the Un-Completable: The State of AI Completion in JetBrains IDEs. From that post, you might remember this cool chart on code completions. In April, something exciting happened: our acceptance rate went up while the explicit cancel rate dropped.\n\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll break down why and how we got the results without retraining our generation model. \nMan shall not live on LLM alone\nThe LLM that provides your code suggestions is the heart of AI-powered code completion, but it’s not the whole show. There’s a ton happening behind the scenes, in particular on the plugin side, like deciding:\nWhen to show a suggestion. \nIf a suggestion should be single-line or multi-line.\nWhich suggestions to show or conceal – for instance, a suggestion could be semantically incorrect, score too low, or use offensive or inappropriate language. \nBut sometimes, defining the filtering rules is not that straightforward.\nWhat we are trying to achieve\nSimply put, we want to show you only the suggestions you’ll actually use. That means fewer unwanted suggestions – ones you’ll cancel, edit, or delete – without losing the power of our code completion feature. In terms of metrics, we’re working to: \nIncrease the acceptance rate.\nCut down the explicit cancel rate and the percentage of edited/deleted suggestions.\nMaintain or increase the ratio of completed code. \nAll you need is logs\nSo, how do we achieve all of this? The obvious answer is to improve the completion model. \nHowever, it’s not that simple:\nIt’s expensive and time-consuming. Training a better model takes a lot of resources.\nWe can’t see where things go wrong. We don’t store users’ code, so we can’t analyze bad suggestions.\nContext alone isn’t enough – things like user behavior and how a suggestion fits with nearby lines also matter.\nLightweight local filter model\nInstead of going down that long road of improving the completion LLM, we took a different approach: a lightweight local filter model.\nThis model runs on top of the completion LLM and is trained using anonymized logs.\nThe model helps decide whether a suggestion should be shown by analyzing:\nContext: The file/project context (like the language used as well as the number and type of imports) and the completion context (like features that describe a caret location). \nUser behavior: The typing speed and the time spent since last typing.\nThe suggestion itself: Whether references are resolved, if the suggestion repeats itself or is similar to surrounding lines, and additional model outputs like token scores and token entropy.\n\n\n\n\nThe job of the lightweight local filter model is simple: it decides whether to accept or reject a suggestion based on your actions. However, we’ve guided the model a bit during training. We gave extra weight to explicit user actions, like when you explicitly accept or cancel a suggestion. If you edit or delete a suggestion after accepting it, we treat it as less of a win – the more you change, the less weight it gets.\nTechnically speaking, the model is built with CatBoost, which is efficient and doesn’t need tons of data. The model is specifically designed to be lightweight – once trained, it becomes a compact 2.5 MB file and runs directly in Kotlin on users’ machines, making predictions in 1–2 milliseconds.\nWhat we have achieved\nOur A/B tests in the EAP showed great results, and they’re getting even better. The filter model boosted the acceptance rate by ~50% and cut the explicit cancel rate by ~40%, all while keeping the ratio of completed code steady.\nWe officially rolled out the filter model in version 2024.1 of JetBrains IDEs for a range of languages, including Java, Kotlin, Python, PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, CSS, and Ruby. In later versions we also covered C#, C++, Rust, and HCL, plus the local filter model for cloud completion with Mellum in Python, Java, and Kotlin. We plan to cover even more languages soon.\nMeanwhile, both the local code completion model and the lightweight local filter model continue to evolve and improve together.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we have learned\nEven if your LLM is already doing a great job, there’s always room for improvement. You don’t always need massive, complex models to make a difference. Sometimes, the smart use of extra data like logs can do the trick. So, what’s next for AI-powered code completion? How far can we push it?\nShare your thoughts and ideas in the comments below!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA has supported Java 24 since an earlier release, with more enhancements being added in the later releases!\nI’m often asked, “What’s the best feature of Java 24?” My answer? Why pick just one? 🙂\nJava 24 continues to enhance the language with improvements like Simple source files and instance main methods, Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch, Module Import Declarations, Flexible constructor bodies, and API enhancements such as Stream Gatherers – plus many more.\nOne of Java’s greatest strengths is its predictable six-month release cadence, allowing developers to explore both production and preview features regularly. However, keeping up with new features every six months can feel overwhelming. In this blog post, I’ll walk you through a few key Java 24 features – what they are, how you can use them, and how IntelliJ IDEA supports them. But first, let’s make sure you have the right setup in place.\nSimple source files and instance main methods (JEP 495)\nImplicit classes and import statements, shorter main() method, ‘println()’, to output values – make it easier for beginners to get started in Java. If you are an experienced developer, these features can help you create scripts, games, and utilities using fewer lines of code.\nIf you are new to this feature, I’d recommend you to check out my introductory blog post – Java 24: ‘HelloWorld’ and ‘main()’ meet minimalistic and detailed blog post – Java 24: Build Games, Prototypes, Utilities, and More –With Less Boilerplate, that talks about its practical use cases. This feature can not only help new developers get started with writing programs like simple calculations, printing patterns, enjoy joy of programming by creating simple console and gui based games, but also help create utilities for experienced developers such as processing files, or access web resources.\nIn this section, I’ll focus on IntelliJ IDEA’s support for this Java feature.\nCreate a simple source file with instance main method\nWhen you use IntelliJ IDEA to create and run your simple files, you could run it like any other executable class (saves you from specifying the compilation or run time command line parameters that you must use otherwise). If you miss setting the language level to 24, IntelliJ IDEA can detect that and prompt you to do so (as shown below):\n\n\n\n\nChanging an implicit class to a regular class\nWhen you are ready to level up and work with other concepts like user defined classes, you might want to convert your implicit classes to a regular class. You can use context action ‘Convert implicitly declared class into regular class‘, as shown below (this action will add relevant import statements):\n\n\n\n\nConverting a regular class to an implicit class\nSometimes a packaged class might be better off as an implicit class because it might not be using the concepts meant for a regular class. If so, you could do that by using the action ‘Convert into implicitly declared class’ (as shown below). During the conversion, IntelliJ IDEA will remove the import statements that are no longer required:\n\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes – implicit class with instance method main()\nBehind the scenes, the Java compiler creates an implicit top level class, with a no-argument constructor, so that these classes don’t need to be treated in a way that is different to the regular classes.\nHere’s a gif that shows a decompiled class for you (via Decompiler feature in IntelliJ IDEA) for the source code file AnimateText.java:\n\n\n\n\nInteracting with console – println() vs. System.out.println() calls\nTo make it simpler for new developers to interact with the console, that is, output messages to console and to read input from it, a new class – java.io.IO was created in Java 23. It contains just a handful of overloaded readln() and println() methods (as shown below):\n\n\n\nClass java.io.IO is automatically imported in implicit classes. So, instead of using System.out.println(), you can now use println() to output messages to a console (and readln() to read from console). Interestingly, println() was added to this class in Java 24.\nOverloaded main method in the implicit class\nWhen you overload main() method in an implicit class, there would be an order of preference to be considered ‘the’ main() method. All of these following methods are valid signatures of main() methods in an implicit class:\npublic static void main(String args[]) {}\npublic void main(String args[]) {}\npublic static void main() {}\nstatic void main() {}\npublic void main() {}\nvoid main() {}\n\n\n\nWhen you have overloaded main() method in your implicit class, IntelliJ IDEA would show the run icon next to the correct or preferred ‘main’ method:\n\n\n\n\nMissing main method in an implicit class\nIf there is no valid main method detected in an implicit class, IntelliJ IDEA could add one for you, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nPrimitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview Feature)\nCurrently in its second preview, the feature Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch enhances Java’s pattern matching capabilities by incorporating primitive types across all pattern. This allows you to use primitive type patterns directly with instanceof and switch expressions (which was earlier restricted to objects), streamlining code and reducing the need for manual type conversions.\nA quick example\nThis feature enables you to use primitive types in switch expressions with guard patterns, as follows:\npublic String getHTTPCodeDesc(int code) {\n   return switch(code) {\n       case 100 -> \"Continue\";\n       case 200 -> \"OK\";\n       case 301 -> \"Moved Permanently\";\n       case 302 -> \"Found\";\n       case 400 -> \"Bad Request\";\n       case 500 -> \"Internal Server Error\";\n       case 502 -> \"Bad Gateway\";\n       case int i when i > 100 && i < 200 -> \"Informational\";\n       case int i when i > 200 && i < 300 -> \"Successful\";\n       case int i when i > 302 && i < 400 -> \"Redirection\";\n       case int i when i > 400 && i < 500 -> \"Client Error\";\n       case int i when i > 502 && i < 600 -> \"Server Error\";\n       default                            -> \"Unknown error\";\n   };\n}\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you could use primitives with instanceof operator. \nThis feature is being previewed again without any change. I covered this feature together with how IntelliJ IDEA supports it in my previous blog post – Java 23 and IntelliJ IDEA. I’d suggest you check it out for details. This blog post answers questions, such as what does it mean to add primitive types to Pattern Matching, to multiple examples and robust data flow analysis in IntelliJ IDEA.\nInterview with creators of this feature\nWe also interviewed the owner of this feature, Aggelos Biboudis, Principal Member Technical Staff, Oracle, Brian Goetz, Java language Architect with Oracle, Tagir Valeev, Java Team Technical Lead, JetBrains.\n\n    \nCheck it out to find out the bigger picture of why primitive data types are being added to the Java language and the finer details of the changes they propose. \nModule Import Declarations\nIn its second preview, Module Import Declarations enables you to import all packages exported by a module in a single declaration. It simplifies the reuse of modular libraries without requiring the importing code to be modularized itself. For example, the declaration import module java.base; imports all public top-level classes and interfaces from packages exported by the java.base module, eliminating the need for multiple individual import statements. This improves readability of code, especially when working with extensive APIs.\nA quick example\nImagine your code includes multiple import statements, such as the following:\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.util.HashMap;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport java.nio.*;\nThese could be replaced by an import module statement, as follows:\nimport java.base.*;\nWhich packages are exported by the module java.base (or other modules)?\nIt is simple to answer this question when you are using IntelliJ IDEA. Click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut (Go to Declaration or Usages) and you could view the definition of this module to find out all the modules exported by this module. This is shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nInterview with creators of this feature\nWe also interviewed the owner of this feature, GavinBierman, Programming Language Designer at Oracle.\n\n    \nGavin covered the differences between single-type import and type-import-on-demand declarations, explaining what they are and why individuals and organizations prefer one style over the other. He also talked about how the “Module Import Declarations” feature automatically imports on demand from transitive dependencies of modules. He covered ambiguous imports and how to deal with them, name ambiguity, and how to submit relevant feedback on this feature to the teams at OpenJDK. \nFlexible Constructor bodies\nIn its third preview, this feature is useful when a superclass calls a method from its constructor and you want to override this method in a subclass and want to access a field from the subclass inside this method. Previously, the subclass field would not be initialized when the method was called from the superclass constructor. Now it is possible to initialize the field and prevent surprises. Here’s an example code to show this feature:\nabstract class Action {\n   public Action() {\n       System.out.println(\"performing \" + getText());\n   }\n   public abstract String getText();\n}\nclass DoubleAction extends Action {\n   private final String text;\n   private DoubleAction(String text) {\n       this.text = text; // this did not compile before Java 23 with preview features enabled.\n       super();\n   }\n   @Override public String getText() {\n       return text + text;\n   }\n}\n\n\n\nIf you are new to this feature, don’t miss checking out my detailed blog post on this feature, Constructor Makeover in Java 22 | The IntelliJ IDEA Blog, which talks about the why and how of this feature.\nPreview Features\nThe features covered in this blog post are preview and not production features. With Java’s new release cadence of six months, new language features are released as preview features. They may be reintroduced in later Java versions in the second or more preview, with or without changes. Once they are stable enough, they may be added to Java as a standard language feature.\nPreview language features are complete but not permanent, which essentially means that these features are ready to be used by developers, although their finer details could change in future Java releases depending on developer feedback. Unlike an API, language features can’t be deprecated in the future. So, if you have feedback about any of the preview language features, feel free to share it on the JDK mailing list (free registration required).\nBecause of how these features work, IntelliJ IDEA is committed to only supporting preview features for the current JDK. Preview language features can change across Java versions, until they are dropped or added as a standard language feature. Code that uses a preview language feature from an older release of the Java SE Platform might not compile or run on a newer release.\nSummary\nJava 24 introduces key enhancements like Simple Source Files, Primitive Type Patterns, Module Import Declarations, and Flexible Constructor Bodies. IntelliJ IDEA has supported Java 24 since an earlier release, with more enhancements being added in the later releases!\nWith intelligent assistance, IntelliJ IDEA simplifies adopting Java 24’s features by offering smart code suggestions, seamless conversions, and robust analysis. Its support ensures a smooth development experience as Java evolves.",

You can download build 251.23774.112 for free from the link below, via the Toolbox App, or as a snap package if you’re using Ubuntu.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 BETA\nRead the full release notes on YouTrack. Below is a brief overview of the major features and bug fixes that are now available in Beta ahead of their inclusion in the stable CLion 2025.1 release.\nThe key features\nThroughout the 2025.1 EAP, we’ve added a variety of new features for CLion Nova, debugging, embedded development, project formats, and more. Here are the most important ones.\nCLion Nova\nSupport for out-of-project files. Header and source files that are not included in a project now get full code analysis and code assistance functionality, just like regular project files. The current implementation covers the vast majority of known use cases, though there are still some edge cases that we plan to address after receiving user feedback.\nBasic support for Objective-C. You can now work with Objective-C source files and see syntax highlighting, warnings, code completion suggestions, and other Clangd-based features.\n\n\n\n\nSupport for GoogleTest and Catch2 in Bazel projects. CLion Nova now supports the GoogleTest and Catch2 testing frameworks when working with Bazel projects.\nWe’ve also implemented several settings, actions, and smart keys that were available in CLion Classic but missing in CLion Nova, making development with the new engine more convenient:\nC/C++ auto-import options such as Auto import local files with quotes and Auto import on completion.\nEditor actions, including the ability to move a caret to a code block end or start using a shortcut.\nSmart keys such as Unindent on Backspace and Surround selection on typing quote or brace. Learn more about these features in our blog post.\nDebugger\nSupport for Qt renderers. Qt renderers, also known as Qt pretty printers and Qt debugging helpers, allow you to view Qt variables such as QString, QByteArray, and other data types in a human-readable form.\n\n\n\n\nSupport for a custom LLDB debugger. You can now use a custom LLDB when working on macOS or Linux in addition to the bundled LLDB v19.1.3. This allows you to choose the LLDB version best suited to the requirements of your project.\nViewing two-channel OpenCV matrices as images. When you’re debugging code that uses a two-channel OpenCV matrix, such as cv::Mat m(2, 3, CV_8UC2), CLion’s debugger gives you the option to view it as an image.\n\n\n\n\nCustom location for .natvis files. When working with the MSVC debugger, you can now specify a custom location for your .natvis files. This provides more flexibility when using Git or other version control systems.\nEmbedded development\nThe new STM32CubeMX Project Wizard. We’ve reworked the approach to creating new STM32CubeMX projects to make it more convenient and provide support for more STM32 chips and project types. CLion now relies on the native STM32CubeMX generation of CMake, so project creation in CLion aligns with the vendor’s approach and toolset.\nHowever, we understand that the current method of creating an STM32CubeMX project is still not ideal. We’ll continue to improve it and make it easier to use. Your feedback on the new STM32CubeMX Project Wizard is greatly appreciated (CPP-42553).\nThe ST-LINK debug server. When debugging STM32 projects, you can now use the ST-LINK debug server template. Designed specifically for STM32 chips, it simplifies the configuration process.\n\n\n\n\nDebug Servers is still an experimental feature with some limitations. See our documentation for more information.\nSerial Port Monitor plugin improvements. We’ve added the ability to view and manage hardware control signals, as well as the ability to view timestamps in the monitor output. This gives you more control over your attached devices and makes tracking serial monitor data easier when debugging or troubleshooting.\nProject formats and build tools\nWest build options. You can use West project settings to pass additional parameters for the west build command, such as a path to a custom board or options for the underlying build tool.\n\n\n\n\nSysbuild support. This high-level build system allows you to build multiple images for boards with multiple SoCs (systems on chip) or SoCs with multiple CPU cores.\nCMake 3.31.4 bundled with CMake Presets v10. We’ve updated the bundled CMake version to the latest, v3.31.4. Among other things, it includes support for CMake Presets v10. CMake Presets are stored as JSON files and are useful when you want to specify common configuration and build options for a CMake project to share them with other users.\nOther features\nNatural language inline prompts for C/C++. You can now interact with AI Assistant directly in the editor using natural language prompts. After you write a prompt and press Tab, AI Assistant interprets it and translates it into code changes, taking into account the project context.\n\n                        \n\n\nYou can undo the changes, modify your prompt, or add a follow-up message if you want to improve some of the suggested changes. The feature is only available to users with a trial or paid subscription to the JetBrains AI Assistant plugin.\nCl6x compiler support improvements. CLion now parses cl6x output more accurately when configuring this compiler as a custom compiler option with the corresponding YAML file.\nKey bug fixes\nHere are the major bug fixes that we’ve included in CLion 2025.1 Beta:\nWhen using CLion Nova, changes to the tab width in the Code Style settings are no longer reset after a project reloads.\nCLion Nova now correctly handles _Float types in the implementation of the std::format, which means resolving std::format when using GCC now works as expected.\nCreating a new PlatformIO project from CLion’s Welcome screen now works as intended.\nOpening a file in LightEdit mode no longer crashes the IDE.\nThe debugger now works correctly when using an OpenOCD run/debug configuration with a path to a board that contains spaces.\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 BETA\nYour CLion team\nJetBrains\nThe Drive to Develop",

Do you often struggle to find detailed instructions on using certain features effectively?\nNow, there’s a solution to get you the information you need right in the IDE.\n\nVisual Studio now makes it easy to access GitHub Copilot Chat from Feature Search (Ctrl+Q). Clicking “Ask Copilot” will send your query to GitHub Copilot Chat and get detailed responses, without leaving Visual Studio and search for docs online.\nThis tool interprets the semantic meaning of your query, considers your Visual Studio version, and provides accurate answers. This means no more guessing the correct terminology or navigating through multiple menus.\nFor instance, typing ‘prettify file’ in the traditional search might not bring up the ‘format document’ option. However, GitHub Copilot Chat understands the intent behind your query and can guide you to the correct setting with all the information you need to use it.\nHow it works\nNotice the @vs label in the sent chat message? When your search query gets sent over to the GitHub Copilot chat, the @vs agent is called. This @vs agent has in-depth knowledge about the workings of Visual Studio, with strong context on the features available in the current version you’re using and how those work.\nThe @vs agent works in the Visual Studio GitHub Copilot Chat even if you’re not starting from Feature Search. You can invoke the agent on your own by adding @vs to your chat message.\nAppreciation for your feedback\nYour insights help us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support.\nYour feedback is invaluable in shaping Visual Studio’s future. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Find the IDE features you need with GitHub Copilot and Search appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

Our latest update overhauls the GitHub account management experience and improves how you work with multiple accounts, especially for GitHub Copilot and version control scenarios. In this post, we’ll detail how these changes will make your GitHub workflow smoother, from the moment you start using Visual Studio to your everyday coding.\nOnboarding Improvements\nThe latest Visual Studio 2022 update streamlines your GitHub experience right from the very start. You can now Sign in with your GitHub account during the first launch experience:\n\nIf you would rather configure your account at a later stage, you can also sign in with GitHub accounts directly from the Visual Studio shell, regardless of whether a Microsoft account is present.\n\nPlease note that roaming settings are not currently available for GitHub accounts. You’ll need to add a Microsoft account if you want to roam your Visual Studio settings across devices.\nMultiple GitHub Accounts\nWe’re happy to announce that you can now add and manage multiple GitHub accounts! Multi-account support was a top request from you, and the latest update enables it for all Visual Studio 2022 users.\nYou can add multiple public GitHub accounts effortlessly from all the same identity controls you normally interact with. For instance, you can open the profile card, click on “Add another account,” sign in to your GitHub account, and repeat as needed!\n\nSeamless Switching Between Accounts\nOnce you successfully add your first GitHub account, Visual Studio will automatically If you have multiple accounts, switching the active accounts is effortless; just open the profile card, access the account options and select the “Set as active account” button.\n\nGitHub Copilot Integration\nThe active GitHub account drives the activation of GitHub Copilot. If your active account is subscribed to GitHub Copilot Free, GitHub Copilot for Individuals or GitHub Copilot for Business, the Copilot feature will activate automatically.\nYou can check the GitHub Copilot badge to quickly assess if your active account has valid entitlements, as its status will indicate whether GitHub Copilot is active.\n\nVersion Control Integration\nManaging multiple accounts also impacts version control-related scenarios. If you are working on GitHub pull requests or issues, Visual Studio prompt you to set a GitHub account and will remember your preference for each repository.\n\nThat means that you won’t need to worry about switching accounts for regular Git operations like push, pull, and fetch. between it and the repository preferences,\nConclusion\nWe’ve been working hard to make your GitHub experience in Visual Studio 2022 even better, and we think you’ll love these updates!  From easier onboarding and managing multiple GitHub accounts to automatic GitHub Copilot activation and smart Git handling, this update has you covered.\nThank you for your continuous feedback, which helps us make Visual Studio better with every release.  Please remember that you can keep sharing your thoughts and suggestions by visiting our developer community portal.\nThe post Boost your GitHub productivity with our new multi-account support! appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

This new feature aims to streamline your documentation process and enhance your coding experience.\nTo access these updates, you will need a GitHub Copilot subscription. If you don’t already have GitHub Copilot, you can sign up for free here.\nAI doc comment generation\nIf you have automatic doc comment generation enabled via your settings, you can simply type what would trigger your doc comment format (such as ///) and Copilot suggestions will automatically fill out the function description based on the contents of the function, including a summary and any parameters and return types (if available). You can then accept these suggestions using a single tab, just like regular Copilot code completions.\n\nHow to enable doc comments\nTo access this feature, you will need to have automatically generating doc comments enabled.\nFor C++ projects, you can configure the generated documentation comment styles using the following setting in Tools > Options. Both XML and Doxygen style comments are supported by this feature.\n\nFor C#, you would need to enable the following setting in your Tools > Options\n\nShare your feedback\nThis feature is available for Visual Studio 17.14 Preview 2 for both C# and C++ project files. We encourage you to explore this feature and see how GitHub Copilot can transform and simplify your coding experience.\nWe deeply appreciate the continuous feedback from our users, which drives us to improve and innovate.

 \n  Q&A\nQ1. 다음(Daum)은 왜 네이버에게 1위 자리를 빼앗겼나요?\nA. 네이버가 검색 엔진을 강화하고, ‘지식iN’ 같은 차별화된 서비스를 제공하면서 검색 점유율을 급격히 끌어올렸기 때문입니다. 또한 모바일 시장 대응이 늦어지면서 점유율을 잃었습니다.\nQ2. 티스토리는 왜 네이버 블로그보다 인기가 많았나요?\nA. 티스토리는 HTML/CSS 편집이 가능하고, 애드센스를 통한 수익화가 가능했기 때문에 많은 블로거들에게 인기가 있었습니다. 반면, 네이버 블로그는 폐쇄적인 운영 방식을 고수했습니다.\nQ3. 카카오는 왜 다음을 인수했나요?\nA. 카카오는 다음을 인수하여 포털 검색 트래픽을 활용하고, 뉴스·커뮤니티·광고 플랫폼을 강화하려 했습니다. 하지만 시간이 지나면서 검색보다는 카카오톡, AI, 금융 등 다른 사업에 집중하게 되었습니다.\nQ4. 다음이 카카오에서 분리되면 티스토리는 어떻게 될까요?\nA. 티스토리가 다음과 함께 독립할지, 아니면 카카오가 유지할지가 관건입니다. 카카오가 유지하면 브런치, 카카오뷰와의 연계가 강화될 가능성이 높고, 다음과 함께 독립한다면 기존 포털 검색 기반 블로그로 남을 가능성이 큽니다.\nQ5. 티스토리를 떠나야 할까요?\nA. 티스토리의 미래가 불확실한 만큼, 워드프레스, 브런치, 네이버 블로그 같은 대체 플랫폼을 고려해 대비하는 것이 좋습니다.\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"다음(Daum)은 왜 네이버에게 1위 자리를 빼앗겼나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네이버가 검색 엔진을 강화하고, ‘지식iN’ 같은 차별화된 서비스를 제공하면서 검색 점유율을 급격히 끌어올렸기 때문입니다. 또한 모바일 시장 대응이 늦어지면서 점유율을 잃었습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"티스토리는 왜 네이버 블로그보다 인기가 많았나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"티스토리는 HTML/CSS 편집이 가능하고, 애드센스를 통한 수익화가 가능했기 때문에 많은 블로거들에게 인기가 있었습니다. 반면, 네이버 블로그는 폐쇄적인 운영 방식을 고수했습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"카카오는 왜 다음을 인수했나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"카카오는 다음을 인수하여 포털 검색 트래픽을 활용하고, 뉴스·커뮤니티·광고 플랫폼을 강화하려 했습니다. 하지만 시간이 지나면서 검색보다는 카카오톡, AI, 금융 등 다른 사업에 집중하게 되었습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"다음이 카카오에서 분리되면 티스토리는 어떻게 될까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"티스토리가 다음과 함께 독립할지, 아니면 카카오가 유지할지가 관건입니다. 카카오가 유지하면 브런치, 카카오뷰와의 연계가 강화될 가능성이 높고, 다음과 함께 독립한다면 기존 포털 검색 기반 블로그로 남을 가능성이 큽니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"티스토리를 떠나야 할까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"티스토리의 미래가 불확실한 만큼, 워드프레스, 브런치, 네이버 블로그 같은 대체 플랫폼을 고려해 대비하는 것이 좋습니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Go로 포팅하면 다음과 같은 이점이 명확히 나타납니다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>컴파일 성능 대폭 향상 (최대 10배)</strong>: 초기 테스트에서 VS Code 전체 빌드 시간을 77.8초에서 7.5초로 단축하여 약 10배의 성능 향상을 입증했습니다.</li>\n<li><strong>멀티코어 활용 가능</strong>: Go의 멀티스레딩 지원 덕분에 병렬로 파싱, 바인딩, 타입 검사를 실행할 수 있게 되었습니다.</li>\n<li><strong>메모리 효율성 향상</strong>: 네이티브 코드의 메모리 효율 개선과 공유 메모리 활용으로 메모리 사용량이 최대 50% 감소했습니다.</li>\n<li><strong>간편한 배포 및 유지보수성 향상</strong>: Go는 정적 컴파일을 지원하여 단일 바이너리 형태로 배포할 수 있어 환경 설정 및 CI/CD가 간편해집니다. 또한, 정적 타입 덕분에 컴파일러 자체의 안정성도 높아집니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>결과적으로 개발자들이 더욱 빠르고 안정적인 개발 경험을 얻을 수 있게 되며, IDE의 초기 로딩과 코드 편집 응답 속도가 획기적으로 빨라질 것으로 기대됩니다.</p>\n<h2>왜 Rust가 아니라 Go인가?</h2>\n<p>발표 직후 가장 큰 논쟁거리는 왜 Rust가 아니라 Go를 선택했느냐는 것이었습니다. Rust는 최근 JavaScript 도구 생태계에서 성능을 높이는 새로운 표준처럼 여겨졌기 때문입니다. Rust를 선택하지 않은 이유는 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>구조적 호환성 문제</strong>: 기존 TypeScript 컴파일러(tsc)는 JS의 GC와 가변 객체 그래프를 광범위하게 활용합니다. Rust로 옮기려면 공유 가변성(shared mutability) 문제로 인해 수많은 부분을 재설계해야 했고, 이는 호환성을 깨고 버그를 초래할 위험이 컸습니다.</li>\n<li><strong>복잡성 증가</strong>: Rust의 엄격한 메모리 관리 규칙을 준수하면서 기존 기능을 그대로 구현하려면 과도하게 <code inline=\"\">unsafe</code> 코드를 사용하는 등 Rust의 장점을 살리지 못하는 결과를 초래할 수 있었습니다.</li>\n<li><strong>개발자 경험의 일관성</strong>: 타입스크립트 설계자 Anders Hejlsberg는 \"새로운 패러다임으로 재설계하는 리스크보다는 기존의 동작 방식을 최대한 유지하는 것이 중요했다\"고 밝혔습니다. Go는 JS와 유사한 가비지 컬렉터를 사용하며 메모리 관리와 코드 스타일 측면에서 기존 코드베이스와 호환성이 높았습니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>실제 Rust 기반의 SWC 컴파일러 개발자(kdy1) 역시 과거 타입스크립트 컴파일러를 Rust로 포팅하는 시도를 했지만, 구조적 한계 때문에 중단한 사례도 있습니다.</p>\n<h2>앞으로의 로드맵과 일정</h2>\n<p>마이크로소프트는 이번 프로젝트를 TypeScript 7.0 버전에서 공식적으로 출시할 예정입니다. 구체적인 로드맵은 다음과 같습니다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2025년 중반까지 Go로 작성된 TypeScript 컴파일러의 <strong>프리뷰 버전</strong> 제공 예정</li>\n<li>2025년 말까지 타입 검사 및 언어 서비스까지 기능 완비(feature-complete) 예정</li>\n<li>이후 기존 JS 버전(TypeScript 6.x 버전)은 상당 기간 유지하면서 개발자가 점진적으로 전환하도록 지원</li>\n</ul>\n<p>현재 GitHub에 Go 포팅 버전의 초기 코드가 공개되어 있어, 개발자들이 직접 테스트하고 피드백을 줄 수 있습니다.</p>\n<h2>커뮤니티 및 전문가들의 반응: 기대와 우려 사이</h2>\n<p>커뮤니티에서는 대체로 긍정적인 평가가 많습니다. 특히 현업 개발자들은 \"10배 빨라진 컴파일 속도\"에 큰 기대를 나타냈습니다. 하지만 Rust가 아니라 Go를 선택한 것에 대한 일부 아쉬움과 우려도 있었습니다. 특히 WebAssembly 번들 크기나 성능 측면에서 Rust보다 불리할 수 있다는 점에 대한 지적도 나왔습니다.</p>\n<p>그럼에도 불구하고, 마이크로소프트가 공개한 포팅 이유와 기술적 설명을 접한 뒤에는 다수의 개발자가 납득하고 긍정적으로 평가했습니다. 무엇보다 \"중요한 건 컴파일러의 성능 향상과 안정성이며, 결과가 좋다면 언어 선택은 부차적이다\"라는 의견이 힘을 얻고 있습니다.</p>\n<h2>결론: TypeScript의 새로운 도약을 기대하며</h2>\n<p>결론적으로 마이크로소프트의 이번 선택은 TypeScript의 향후 10년을 대비한 전략적인 결정으로 평가됩니다. Go로의 포팅이 성공적으로 이루어진다면, 앞으로 더 많은 프로젝트들이 TypeScript의 강력한 타입 시스템과 함께 더욱 향상된 성능과 생산성을 경험할 수 있을 것입니다. Rust 등 다른 후보 언어를 둘러싼 초기 논쟁도 있었지만, 결과적으로 이번 포팅 결정은 실용적이고 현실적인 선택이라는 평가를 받고 있습니다.</p>\n<p>타입스크립트의 새로운 시대가 열리고 있습니다. 마이크로소프트의 이번 결정이 실제 어떤 성과로 이어질지, 커뮤니티와 함께 기대하며 지켜볼 일입니다.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>출처 및 참고자료</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GitHub 공식 저장소: <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go\">microsoft/typescript-go</a></li>\n<li>Microsoft 공식 블로그: <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/typescript-native-port/\">A 10x Faster TypeScript</a></li> \n<li>개발자 커뮤니티 (Hacker News): <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43333156\">A 10x Faster TypeScript</a></li>\n<li>개발자 커뮤니티 (Reddit): <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/1j8s467/a_10x_faster_typescript/\">A 10x Faster TypeScript : r/typescript</a></li>\n<li>2ality 기술 블로그: <a href=\"https://2ality.com/2025/03/typescript-in-go.html\">A closer look at the details behind the Go port of the TypeScript compiler</a></li>\n<li>Simon Willison 기술 블로그: <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/ryan-cavanaugh/\">A quote from Ryan Cavanaugh</a></li>\n<li>YouTube 영상 요약 및 분석 (ChainDesk.ai 요약 페이지): <a href=\"https://www.chaindesk.ai/tools/youtube-summarizer/microsoft-goes-nuclear-on-type-script-codebase-PQ2WjtaPfXU\">Microsoft goes nuclear on TypeScript codebase…</a></li>\n</ul>",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 공간을 통해서도 과거에 몇 번 글을 쓴 적이 있는데, 내가 2012년에 스트롱을 시작하고 첫 2년 동안 투자자로서 가장 스트레스를 많이 받았던 건, 우리가 투자한 회사의 창업가보다 내가 그 사업에 대해서 더 많이 알고, 내가 그 사업을 하면 더 잘할 수 있을 것 같은데, 대표가 항상 내 생각과 말과 다르게 생각하고 행동할 때였다. 아마도 이걸 보면 공감하는 투자자들이 꽤 있을 것이다.\n예를 들면, B2C를 해야 하는데 B2B를 하고 있거나, 아주 좁고 깊게 시장을 공략해야 하는데 넓고 얕게 공략하거나, 싸게 많이 팔아야 하는데 비싸게 적게 팔고 있거나, 뭐, 이런 것부터, 제품을 만드는 방법, 펀딩 전략, 채용 전략 등과 같은 중, 장기적인 회사의 방향에 대해서 하나부터 열까지 내가 동의하지 못하는 경우가 지금도 많지만, VC 초창기 시절에는 투자하는 회사마다 이런 갈등이 있었다. 지금 생각해 보면, 그땐 나는 VC가 아니라 VC 흉내를 내는 거였는데, 하루 종일 일하고 집에 와서 침대에 누우면, 엄청난 고민과 스트레스 때문에 잠을 설쳤는데, “왜 저분은 사업을 저렇게 할까? 내가 하면 훨씬 더 잘할 수 있을 것 같은데 왜 내 말을 안 들을까?”와 같은 생각을 하면서 참 괴로웠다.\n그런데, 더 많은 회사에 투자하고, 훨씬 더 많은 창업가들을 만나면서 이 부분에 대한 생각이 완전히 바뀌었다. 그리고 다행히도, 점점 더 시간이 지나면서 내가 VC 초창기에 스트레스받았던 이런 고민이 쓸데없고, 시간이 지나면서 내가 완전히 틀렸다는 게 점점 더 증명되고 있어서 다행이다.\n시간이 지나면서 우리가 과거에 투자한 회사들의 실적과 결과가 조금씩 명확해지고 있는데, 잘되고 있는 회사들은 실은 내가 주장했던 이 회사들이 가야 하는 방향과 취해야 하는 전략과는 완전히 다른 방법으로 사업을 하는 회사들이 훨씬 더 많다. 즉, 내가 창업가들에게 “사업은 이렇게 해야 한다.”라고 훈수했던 내용과 완전히 다른, 창업가들이 주장한 방식으로 사업한 회사들이 잘 되고 있다. 내가 주장했던 방식으로 사업을 했다면, 아마도 망했을 것이다. 이와 반대로, 내가 너무 세게 주장해서, 내 말을 듣고 본인의 의지와는 다르게 사업했던 창업가들은 지금은 회사가 망했거나 잘 못 하고 있다. 나 때문에 사업이 잘 안됐다고 할 것까진 아니지만, 그래도 이분들이 내 말은 무시하고, 본인이 생각하는 대로만 사업을 했다면, 어쩌면 더 잘 할텐데라는 생각을 요새 가끔 한다.\n내가 맞을 확률보단, 틀릴 확률이 훨씬 높다는 걸 직접 몸으로 체험하면서 요새 나는 내가 창업가들보다 사업을 더 잘 한다는 틀린 믿음으로 인한 고민을 잘 안 하고, 스트레스도 거의 안 받는다. 이건 생각해 보면 너무 당연한 건데, 나는 VC 초반에는 정말 아마추어 같은 생각을 했던 것 같다. 나 같이 수백 개 회사에 투자해서 한 회사에 대해 진지하게 고민하고 생각하는 시간이 짧고 얕은 초기 VC가 어떻게 1년 365일, 하루 24시간 한가지 사업과 제품에 대해서만 고민하는 창업가보다 그 사업을 더 잘 알거나, 잘할 수가 있겠는가? 솔직히 과거에 내가 몇몇 대표님들에게 “나 같으면 그렇게 안 할 것 같은데요” , “그 사업은 이렇게 해야죠” 등의 발언을 했던 걸 생각해 보면 얼굴이 약간 화끈거린다.\n그래서 어느 순간부터 나는 선을 명확하게 긋기 시작했다. 나는 사업을 운영하는 사람이 아니라 그 사업을 운영하는 믿을만한 창업가들에게 투자하고 이들을 응원하는 사람이라는 선을. 흑백논리로 따져보면 이건 네 사업이지, 내 사업이 아니라는 사고다. 그리고 이렇게 선을 명확하게 그으니까 긍정적인 일들이 생기고 있다. 일단, 내 스트레스 관리 차원에서 너무 좋다. 투자한 회사 대표가 사업을 잘 못 해도, 내가 할 수 있는 건 많이 없다고 명확하게 구분하니까 스트레스를 잘 안 받는다. 그리고, 내가 창업가들보다 사업을 못하는 게 명백하기 때문에, 내가 하는 이야기를 그들이 듣지 않아도 스트레스가 없다. 이런 생각으로 창업가들을 대하다 보니, 서로 웃는 얼굴로 할 말을 편안하게 할 수 있고, professional 한 관계가 오래 유지되는 걸 요새 직접 경험하고 있다.\n주주총회나 이사회에 가보면, 아직도 내가 투자한 회사의 대표보다 내가 사업을 더 잘할 수 있고, 시장을 더 잘 알고, 제품을 더 잘 만들 수 있다고 생각하는 VC가 있는데, 이들에게 같은 조언을 드리고 싶다. 투자자와 창업가 사이에는 명확한 선이 있고, 그 선을 되도록 넘지 않길 바란다. 왜냐하면, VC가 창업가보다 사업을 더 잘 알고, 잘할 수 있다는 생각은 100% 착각이기 때문이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "2월 26일 엔비디아가 4Q 실적 발표를 했다. 이렇게 큰 회사가 아직도 이렇게 빠르게 성장하면서 AI 시장을 장악하는 동시에 스스로 시장을 만들어가고 있다는 점에서 대단하다고 생각했다. 이때 나는 출장 중이었는데, 호텔에서 CNBC의 실적 발표 후 젠승황과의 인터뷰를 봤다. 여러 가지 재미있는 내용, 젠슨황의 자신감, AI가 가져올 큰 변화 등이 그대로 느껴지는 인터뷰 내용이었다.\n젠슨은 일도 잘하고, 영어도 완전히 미국인처럼 유창하게 하고, 자기 관리도 철저해서 언론에 나오면 항상 보기도 좋고 듣기도 좋은 CEO라고 생각한다. 그와의 인터뷰는 항상 배울 점이 많다고 생각하는데, 이 인터뷰에서 가장 기억에 남는 이런 의미심장한 말을 했다.\n“소프트웨어는 알아서 방법을 찾는다(software finds a way)”\n대충 무슨 말인진 모두 다 알 것이다. 엔비디아 하면 대부분의 사람이 GPU 칩을 만드는 하드웨어 회사라고 생각하는데, 실제로 엔비디아는 소프트웨어 회사라고 하는 게 더 정확한 설명이다. 이들은 사람들이 별로 관심을 두지 않을 때, 일찍이 GPU를 만들기 시작했고, 남들보다 너무 일찍 시작했기 때문에 지난 30년 동안 GPU 하드웨어에 대한 독보적인 경험과 노하우를 축적했다. 실은, 이 하드웨어 경험만으로도 따라잡기 힘들 텐데, 여기에 세계 최고의 소프트웨어 실력도 그동안 연마할 수 있었다. 결국엔 하드웨어를 잘 구동 시켜서 같은 환경에서 더 높은 성능을 뽑기 위해선 소프트웨어가 더 중요하다는 걸 그동안 배웠기 때문에, 내가 여기저기서 듣기로는, 엔비디아의 높은 기업가치는 하드웨어보단 이런 소프트웨어 실력 덕분인 것 같다.\n하드웨어는 한 번 만들면 고치기 힘들고, 그 구조 자체가 경직되어 있어서 유연성과는 거리가 멀다. 반면에, 소프트웨어는 추가 비용 없이 초기 버전을 얼마든지 수정하면서 비약적인 개선이 가능하다. 유연한 소프트웨어는 물과 같이 흐르면서, 물리적으로 제한된 하드웨어, 나라마다 다른 산업적 규제, 그리고 계속 변화하는 세상 속에서 기술을 진화시키고 최적화하면서 지금, 이 시점에 우리에게 가장 필요한 제품을 만들 수 있는 방향으로 제자리를 항상 찾아간다.\n그런데, 젠슨의 이 말을 조금 더 깊게 들어가서 해석해 본다면, 아마도 이분은 항상 방법을 찾는 소프트웨어를 찬양한 게 아니라, 이 소프트웨어를 직접 만드는 엔지니어들을 찬양하기 위해서 이 말을 한 게 아니었을까 생각한다.\n우리 투자사 창업가분들과 오랫동안 같이 일하다 보면, 항상 많은 걸 배우면서 느끼는데, 역시 가장 놀라운 건 이들의 생존력과 적응력이다. 아무리 상황이 좋지 않아도, 이들은 절대로 망하지 않고, 어떻게든 사업을 지속하기 위한 방법을 알아서 찾는다. 내가 이런 분들을 보고 바퀴벌레 같다는 존경의 비유를 자주 하는데, 절대로 빠져나갈 수 없는 공간에 바퀴벌레를 가두어도 결국엔 방법을 찾아서 탈출하는 상황과 비슷하다. 큰 위기에 봉착해서 더 이상 길이 안 보이는데, 우리의 창업가들은 무조건 방법을 찾는다.\n이런 사람들이 만든 소프트웨어는 젠슨이 말 한대로, 불가능을 가능케 할 것이고, 길이 없는 곳에서 길을 만들 것이다. 나는 젠슨의 인터뷰를 보면서, 이분이 엔비디아의 뛰어난 소프트웨어를 칭찬하는 게 아니라, 실제로는 뛰어난 엔지니어들을 찬양한다는 느낌을 강하게 받았다.\n알아서 방법을 찾는 사람들은 엔비디아의 소프트웨어 엔지니어만 있는 게 아니다. 우리가 매일 만나고 투자하는 창업가들이야말로 항상 알아서 방법을 찾는 사람들이다.",

심지어 같은 월급을 받더라도 이런 차이가 생기기도 하죠. 이는 미리 낸 세금과 실제 부담해야 할 세금이 다르기 때문이에요.\n언뜻 들으면 이게 무슨 말인가 싶지만, 나라에서 세금을 어떻게 걷어가는지 조금만 이해하면 세금 환급 구조를 쉽게 이해할 수 있어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}우리는 세금을\n미리 내고 있어요\n우리나라는 납세의 의무가 있어 소득이 있는 대한민국 국민이라면 누구나 세금을 내야 합니다. 하지만 전국에서 동시다발적으로 발생하는 세금을 실시간으로 정확하게 계산하기란 현실적으로 어려운 일이겠죠. \n그래서 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}국세청은 효율적으로 세금을 걷기 위해 원천징수라는 방식을 사용합니다. 원천징수란 소득을 지급하는 쪽에서 소득세, 보험료 등을 포함해 일정 금액을 미리 떼고 세금으로 대신 납부하는 제도예요. 근로자의 세전·세후 월급의 차이가 큰 이유, 프리랜서가 돈을 받을 때 3.3%를 떼고 받는 이유가 바로 이 때문입니다.\n다만, 원천징수는 편의상 추정해 낸 세금이기 때문에 연말정산이나 종합소득세 신고를 통해 납세자가 1년 동안 실제로 부담했어야 할 세금을 정확히 산정하게 됩니다. 이렇게 최종적으로 결정된 세금을 결정세액이라고 하고, 1년간 원천징수로 미리 냈던 세금은 기납부세액이라고 불러요. 이 둘을 비교해 기납부세액이 더 크다면 환급을 받고, 반대로 적다면 세금을 추가로 납부해야 합니다. \n연말정산과 종합소득세 신고는 미리 낸 세금과 실제 부담해야 할 세금을 비교하고 조정하는 과정인 셈이에요.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n내야 할 세금은\n이렇게 매겨져요\n소득금액, 과세표준, 산출세액, 결정세액. 이 네 가지만 알면 세금이 산출되는 구조를 쉽게 이해할 수 있어요.\n사람들은 돈을 버는 과정에서 일하는 데 꼭 필요한 비용을 쓰기도 하고, 매달 기본적인 생활비도 부담하며 살아가요. 그래서 나라에서는 일정 금액을 어느 정도 소득에서 빼주는데, 이를 소득공제라고 해요. 소득금액에서 소득공제를 적용한 금액을 과세표준이라고 합니다. 말 그대로 세금이 부과되는 기준이죠. 그리고 과세표준에 소득세율을 곱하면 산출세액이 정해져요.\n산출세액을 계산한 후에는 세액공제를 적용해 일정 금액을 차감합니다. 세액공제는 특정한 소비나 투자를 유도하기 위해 세금 자체를 줄여주는 제도예요. 세액공제까지 반영되면 내야 할 세금이 정해지는데, 이게 바로 결정세액이에요.\n한 문장으로 정리해볼게요. 소득공제로 과세표준을 정한 뒤 산출세액을 계산하고, 세액공제를 적용하면 납세자가 최종적으로 부담할 결정세액이 산출된다. 단계별로 차근차근 살펴보니 복잡하지 않죠?\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}과세표준이

아티클을 통해 확인해보세요.\n세금 환급,\n이렇게 하면 잘 받을 수 있어요\n같은 소득을 얻었더라도, 소득공제와 세액공제를 어떻게 활용하느냐에 따라 부과되는 세금은 크게 달라져요. 따라서 세금 환급을 잘 받으려면 소득공제를 활용해 과세표준은 최대한 줄이고, 다양한 세액공제 항목을 적용해 결정세액을 낮추는 게 중요해요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0

많다고\n꼭 좋은 걸까요?\n세금 환급을 많이 받으면 보너스를 받은 것 처럼 기분은 좋지만, 사실 환급금이 많은 게 꼭 좋은 것만은 아닙니다. 세금을 돌려받았다는 건 그만큼 내가 실제로 내야 할 세금보다 더 냈었다는 뜻이니까요. \n결국, 세금을 많이 낸 뒤 돌려받든, 적게 내고 추가로 납부하든 결과적으로는 같은 돈을 내는 셈이죠. 오히려 처음부터 세금을 덜 냈다면, 그 돈을 투자금으로 활용하거나 예·적금에 넣어 이자를 받을 수도 있었을 겁니다.\n그럼에도 불구하고\n내가 놓친 환급금\n세금 신고 기간이 지나면 작년 세금에 대해서는 다 끝났다고 생각하기 쉬워요. 하지만 그동안 미처 챙기지 못한 세금 환급액이 남아 있을 수도 있습니다. 전문가가 아닌 이상 공제 혜택을 매번 완벽하게 챙기기는 쉽지 않으니까요. 혹시 내가 더 돌려받을 수 있었던 세금을 놓친 건 아닐까 걱정된다면, 토스에서 확인해 보세요.\n토스 앱에서는 지난 5년간 납부한 세금 중 돌려받을 수 있는 금액이 있는지, 있다면 얼마나 받을 수 있는지 쉽게 확인할 수 있어요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현",
