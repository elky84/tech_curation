        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how Meta is applying machine learning (ML) and diversity algorithms to improve notification quality and user experience. \nWe’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework to reduce uniformity and deliver a more varied and engaging mix of notifications.\nThis new framework reduces the volume of notifications and drives higher engagement rates through more diverse outreach.\nNotifications are one of the most powerful tools for bringing people back to Instagram and enhancing engagement. Whether it’s a friend liking your photo, another close friend posting a story, or a suggestion for a reel you might enjoy, notifications help surface moments that matter in real time.\nInstagram leverages machine learning (ML) models to decide who should get a notification, when to send it, and what content to include. These models are trained to optimize for user positive engagement such as click-through-rate (CTR) – the probability of a user clicking a notification – as well as other metrics like time spent.\nHowever, while engagement-optimized models are effective at driving interactions, there’s a risk that they might overprioritize the product types and authors someone has previously engaged with. This can lead to overexposure to the same creators or the same product types while overlooking other valuable and diverse experiences. \nThis means people could miss out on content that would give them a more balanced, satisfying, and enriched experience. Over time, this can make notifications feel spammy and increase the likelihood that people will disable them altogether. \nThe real challenge lies in finding the right balance: How can we introduce meaningful diversity into the notification experience without sacrificing the personalization and relevance people on Instagram have come to expect?\nTo tackle this, we’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework that helps deliver more diverse, better curated, and less repetitive notifications. This framework has significantly reduced daily notification volume while improving CTR. It also introduces several benefits:\nThe extensibility of incorporating customized soft penalty (demotion) logic for each dimension, enabling more adaptive and sophisticated diversity strategies.\nThe flexibility of tuning demotion strength across dimensions like content, author, and product type via adjustable weights.\nThe integration of balancing personalization and diversity, ensuring notifications remain both relevant and varied.\nThe Risks of Notifications without Diversity\nThe issue of overexposure in notifications often shows up in two major ways:\nOverexposure to the same author: People might receive notifications that are mostly about the same friend. For example, if someone often interacts with content from a particular friend, the system may continue surfacing notifications from that person alone – ignoring other friends they also engage with. This can feel repetitive and one-dimensional, reducing the overall value of notifications.\nOverexposure to the same product surface: People might mostly receive notifications from the same product surface such as Stories, even when Feed or Reels could provide value. For example, someone may be interested in both reel and story notifications but has recently interacted more often with stories. Because the system heavily prioritizes past engagement, it sends only story notifications, overlooking the person’s broader interests. \nIntroducing Instagram’s Diversity-Aware Notification Ranking Framework\nInstagram’s diversity-aware notification ranking framework is designed to enhance the notification experience by balancing the predicted potential for user engagement with the need for content diversity. This framework introduces a diversity layer on top of the existing engagement ML models, applying multiplicative penalties to the candidate scores generated by these models, as figure1, below, shows.\nThe diversity layer evaluates each notification candidate’s similarity to recently sent notifications across multiple dimensions such as content, author, notification type, and product surface. It then applies carefully calibrated penalties—expressed as multiplicative demotion factors—to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive. The adjusted scores are used to re-rank the candidates, enabling the system to select notifications that maintain high engagement potential while introducing meaningful diversity. In the end, the quality bar selects the top-ranked candidate that passes both the ranking and diversity criteria.\nFigure.1: Instagram’s diversity-aware ranking framework where the diversity layer sits on top of the existing modeling layer and penalizes notifications that are too similar to recently sent ones.\nMathematical Formulation \nWithin the diversity layer, we apply a multiplicative demotion factor to the base relevance score of each candidate. Given a notification candidate 𝑐, we compute its final score as the product of its base ranking score and a diversity demotion multiplier:\n\n\nwhere R(c) represents the candidate’s base relevance score, and D(c) ∈ [0,1] is a penalty factor that reduces the score based on similarity to recently sent notifications. We define a set of semantic dimensions (e.g., author, product type) along which we want to promote diversity. For each dimension i, we compute a similarity signal pi(c) between candidate c and the set of historical notifications H, using a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) approach:\n\nwhere simi(·,·) is a predefined similarity function for dimension i. In our baseline implementation, pi(c) is binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a threshold 𝜏i and 0 otherwise. \nThe final demotion multiplier is defined as: \n\n\nwhere each wi  ∈ [0,1] controls the strength of demotion for its respective dimension. This formulation ensures that candidates similar to previously delivered notifications along one or more dimensions are proportionally down-weighted, reducing redundancy and promoting content variation. The use of a multiplicative penalty allows for flexible control across multiple dimensions, while still preserving high-relevance candidates.\nThe Future of Diversity-Aware Ranking\nAs we continue evolving our notification diversity-aware ranking system, a next step is to introduce more adaptive, dynamic demotion strategies. Instead of relying on static rules, we plan to make demotion strength responsive to notification volume and delivery timing. For example, as a user receives more notifications—especially of similar type or in rapid succession—the system progressively applies stronger penalties to new notification candidates, effectively mitigating overwhelming experiences caused by high notification volume or tightly spaced deliveries.\nLonger term, we see an opportunity to bring large language models (LLMs) into the diversity pipeline. LLMs can help us go beyond surface-level rules by understanding semantic similarity between messages and rephrasing content in more varied, user-friendly ways. This would allow us to personalize notification experiences with richer language and improved relevance while maintaining diversity across topics, tone, and timing.\nThe post A New Ranking Framework for Better Notification Quality on Instagram appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the start of the year, we announced a partnership with Mend.io to maximize code security in JetBrains tools. The partnership provided us with quality data about vulnerable and malicious packages, allowing our IDEs and Qodana to spot them for you in your projects.\nOver the last few months, we have been working on integrating additional data about vulnerable APIs in open-source libraries, provided by the software composition analysis (SCA) data provider. That data has now been delivered to our Package Checker plugin, making it an even more effective tool for maintaining code security.\nThe Vulnerable API feature\nThe Package Checker plugin is powered by data from Mend.io about vulnerable APIs and provides code security analysis to detect the usage of vulnerable methods from open-source libraries. \nOur team has recently been working on enriching Mend.io data to cover more public methods from open-source libraries by analyzing call graphs. This means that the plugin has more data at its disposal than ever before, covering more cases.\nThe plugin’s Vulnerable API feature works for various languages, including Java, Kotlin, C# (in Rider and ReSharper), JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. Here’s how to make sure all the necessary inspections are enabled in the active inspection profile:\nFirst, open the IDE settings (⌘, on macOS or Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows/Linux) and go to Editor | Inspections. \nIn the search bar, type “Vulnerable API” and you’ll see the list of related inspections (the final list depends on the plugins you have installed). \nSimply select the ones you need from the list.\n\n\n\n\nThe Settings window\nHow to use it\nThe inspections provided by the Vulnerable API feature will highlight vulnerable methods from open-source libraries in your code. When you hover over the highlighted code, you’ll see a list of vulnerabilities found in a given API call. To address the problem, pull up the context actions (⌥⏎ on macOS or Alt+Enter on Windows/Linux) and select Go to file with declared dependency from the menu. \n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API highlighting \nThis will take you to the place in the build file where the dependency is declared. There, you can again use ⌥⏎ (on macOS) or Alt+Enter (on Windows/Linux) and select Update to unaffected version. The vulnerability list contains links to additional information in the Mend.io vulnerability database.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable dependency highlighting\nThe Package Checker plugin also provides a way to see the list of vulnerabilities in a dedicated window inside the IDE without opening a browser. You can simply use the Show all… link. This will take you to the Vulnerable Dependencies window, which shows the overall state of the project and provides information about every detected vulnerable dependency.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerable Dependencies window\nThe Vulnerable API and Vulnerable Dependencies features are available in Qodana and can be used in CI/CD or security assessment processes.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API feature in Qodana\nLooking ahead\nThese improvements strengthen the existing code security features in JetBrains IDEs and Qodana by providing enhanced vulnerability detection capabilities. Update your IDE to the latest version and enable the Vulnerable API inspections to identify security risks in your codebase.\nYou can learn more about the Package Checker plugin from its page on JetBrains Marketplace, and you can find more information about how to use it in the documentation.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Whether you’re building APIs, dashboards, or machine learning pipelines, choosing the right framework can make or break your project.\nEvery year, we survey thousands of Python developers to help you understand how the ecosystem is evolving, from tooling and languages to frameworks and libraries. Our insights from the State of Python 2025 offer a snapshot of what frameworks developers are using in 2025.\nIn this article, we’ll look at the most popular Python frameworks and libraries. While some long-standing favorites like Django and Flask remain strong, newer contenders like FastAPI are rapidly gaining ground in areas like AI, ML, and data science.\n1. FastAPI\n2024 usage: 38% (+9% from 2023)\nTop of the table is FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+. It was designed to combine Python’s type hinting, asynchronous programming, and OpenAPI standards into a single, developer-friendly package. \nBuilt on top of Starlette (for the web layer) and Pydantic (for data validation), FastAPI offers automatic request validation, serialization, and interactive documentation, all with minimal boilerplate.\nFastAPI is ideal for teams prioritizing speed, simplicity, and standards. It’s especially popular among both web developers and data scientists.\nFastAPI advantages\nGreat for AI/ML: FastAPI is widely used to deploy machine learning models in production. It integrates well with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, and supports async model inference pipelines for maximum throughput.\nAsynchronous by default: Built on ASGI, FastAPI supports native async/await, making it ideal for real-time apps, streaming endpoints, and low-latency ML services.\nType-safe and modern: FastAPI uses Python’s type hints to auto-validate requests and generate clean, editor-friendly code, reducing runtime errors and boosting team productivity.\nAuto-generated docs: FastAPI creates interactive documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc, making it easy for teams to explore and test endpoints without writing any extra docs.\nStrong community momentum: Though it’s relatively young, FastAPI has built a large and active community and has a growing ecosystem of extensions, tutorials, and integrations.\nFastAPI disadvantages\nSteeper learning curve for asynchronous work: async/await unlocks performance, but debugging, testing, and concurrency management can challenge developers new to asynchronous programming.\nBatteries not included: FastAPI lacks built-in tools for authentication, admin, and database management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these manually.\nSmaller ecosystem: FastAPI’s growing plugin landscape still trails Django’s, with fewer ready-made tools for tasks like CMS integration or role-based access control.\n2. Django\n2024 usage: 35% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango once again ranks among the most popular Python frameworks for developers.\nOriginally built for rapid development with built-in security and structure, Django has since evolved into a full-stack toolkit. It’s trusted for everything from content-heavy websites to data science dashboards and ML-powered services.\nIt follows the model-template-view (MTV) pattern and comes with built-in tools for routing, data access, and user management. This allows teams to move from idea to deployment with minimal setup.\nDjango advantages\nBatteries included: Django has a comprehensive set of built-in tools, including an ORM, a user authenticator, an admin panel, and a templating engine. This makes it ideal for teams that want to move quickly without assembling their own stack.\nSecure by default: It includes built-in protections against CSRF, SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities. Django’s security-first approach is one reason it’s trusted by banks, governments, and large enterprises.\nScalable and production-ready: Django supports horizontal scaling, caching, and asynchronous views. It’s been used to power high-traffic platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus.\nExcellent documentation: Django’s official docs are widely praised for their clarity and completeness, making it accessible to developers at all levels.\nMature ecosystem: Thousands of third-party packages are available for everything from CMS platforms and REST APIs to payments and search.\nLong-term support: Backed by the Django Software Foundation, Django receives regular updates, security patches, and LTS releases, making it a safe choice for long-term projects.\nDjango disadvantages\nHeavyweight for small apps: For simple APIs or microservices, Django’s full-stack approach can feel excessive and slow to configure.\nTightly coupled components: Swapping out parts of the stack, such as the ORM or templating engine, often requires workarounds or deep customization.\nSteeper learning curve: Django’s conventions and depth can be intimidating for beginners or teams used to more minimal frameworks.\n3. Flask\n2024 usage: 34% (+1% from 2023)\nFlask is one of the most popular Python frameworks for small apps, APIs, and data science dashboards. \nIt is a lightweight, unopinionated web framework that gives you full control over application architecture. Flask is classified as a “microframework” because it doesn’t enforce any particular project structure or include built-in tools like ORM or form validation.\nInstead, it provides a simple core and lets you add only what you need. Flask is built on top of Werkzeug (a WSGI utility library) and Jinja2 (a templating engine). It’s known for its clean syntax, intuitive routing, and flexibility.\nIt scales well when paired with extensions like SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, or Flask-RESTful. \nFlask advantages\nLightweight and flexible: Flask doesn’t impose structure or dependencies, making it ideal for microservices, APIs, and teams that want to build a stack from the ground up.\nPopular for data science and ML workflows: Flask is frequently used for experimentation like building dashboards, serving models, or turning notebooks into lightweight web apps.\nBeginner-friendly: With minimal setup and a gentle learning curve, Flask is often recommended as a first web framework for Python developers.\nExtensible: A rich ecosystem of extensions allows you to add features like database integration, form validation, and authentication only when needed.\nModular architecture: Flask’s design makes it easy to break your app into blueprints or integrate with other services, which is perfect for teams working on distributed systems.\nReadable codebase: Flask’s source code is compact and approachable, making it easier to debug, customize, or fork for internal tooling.\nFlask disadvantages\nBring-your-own everything: Unlike Django, Flask doesn’t include an ORM, admin panel, or user management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these yourself.\nDIY security: Flask provides minimal built-in protections, so you implement CSRF protection, input validation, and other best practices manually.\nPotential to become messy: Without conventions or structure, large Flask apps can become difficult to maintain unless you enforce your own architecture and patterns.\n4. Requests\n2024 usage: 33% (+3% from 2023)\nRequests isn’t a web framework, it’s a Python library for making HTTP requests, but its influence on the Python ecosystem is hard to overstate. It’s one of the most downloaded packages on PyPI and is used in everything from web scraping scripts to production-grade microservices.\nRequests is often paired with frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to handle outbound HTTP calls. It abstracts away the complexity of raw sockets and urllib, offering a clean, Pythonic interface for sending and receiving data over the web.\nRequests advantages\nSimple and intuitive: Requests makes HTTP feel like a native part of Python. Its syntax is clean and readable – requests.get(url) is all it takes to fetch a resource.\nMature and stable: With over a decade of development, Requests is battle-tested and widely trusted. It’s used by millions of developers and is a default dependency in many Python projects.\nGreat for REST clients: Requests is ideal for consuming APIs, integrating with SaaS platforms, or building internal tools that rely on external data sources.\nExcellent documentation and community: The official docs are clear and concise, and the library is well-supported by tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and GitHub issues.\nBroad compatibility: Requests works seamlessly across Python versions and platforms, with built-in support for sessions, cookies, headers, and timeouts.\nRequests disadvantages\nNot async: Requests is synchronous and blocking by design. For high-concurrency workloads or async-native frameworks, alternatives like HTTPX or AIOHTTP are better.\nNo built-in retry logic: While it supports connection pooling and timeouts, retry behavior must be implemented manually or via third-party wrappers like urllib3.\nLimited low-level control: Requests simplifies HTTP calls but abstracts networking details, making advanced tuning (e.g. sockets, DNS, and connection reuse) difficult.\n5. Asyncio\n2024 usage: 23% (+3% from 2023\nAsyncio is Python’s native library for asynchronous programming. It underpins many modern async frameworks and enables developers to write non-blocking code using coroutines, event loops, and async/await syntax.\nWhile not a web framework itself, Asyncio excels at handling I/O-bound tasks such as network requests and subprocesses. It’s often used behind the scenes, but remains a powerful tool for building custom async workflows or integrating with low-level protocols.\nAsyncio advantages\nNative async support: Asyncio is part of the Python standard library and provides first-class support for asynchronous I/O using async/await syntax.\nFoundation for modern frameworks: It powers many of today’s most popular async web frameworks, including FastAPI, Starlette, and AIOHTTP.\nFine-grained control: Developers can manage event loops, schedule coroutines, and coordinate concurrent tasks with precision, which is ideal for building custom async systems.\nEfficient for I/O-bound workloads: Asyncio excels at handling large volumes of concurrent I/O operations, such as API calls, socket connections, or file reads.\nAsyncio disadvantages\nSteep learning curve: Concepts like coroutines, event loops, and task scheduling can be difficult for developers new to asynchronous programming.\nNot a full framework: Asyncio doesn’t provide routing, templating, or request handling. It’s a low-level tool that requires additional libraries for web development.\nDebugging complexity: Async code can be harder to trace and debug, especially when dealing with race conditions or nested coroutines.\n6. Django REST Framework\n2024 usage: 20% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango REST Framework (DRF) is the most widely used extension for building APIs on top of Django. It provides a powerful, flexible toolkit for serializing data, managing permissions, and exposing RESTful endpoints – all while staying tightly integrated with Django’s core components.\nDRF is especially popular in enterprise and backend-heavy applications where teams are already using Django and want to expose a clean, scalable API without switching stacks. It’s also known for its browsable API interface, which makes testing and debugging endpoints much easier during development.\nDjango REST Framework advantages\nDeep Django integration: DRF builds directly on Django’s models, views, and authentication system, making it a natural fit for teams already using Django.\nBrowsable API interface: One of DRF’s key features is its interactive web-based API explorer, which helps developers and testers inspect endpoints without needing external tools.\nFlexible serialization: DRF’s serializers can handle everything from simple fields to deeply nested relationships, and they support both ORM and non-ORM data sources.\nRobust permissions system: DRF includes built-in support for role-based access control, object-level permissions, and custom authorization logic.\nExtensive documentation: DRF is well-documented and widely taught, with a large community and plenty of tutorials, examples, and third-party packages.\nDjango REST Framework disadvantages\nDjango-dependent with heavier setup: DRF is tightly tied to Django and requires more configuration than lightweight frameworks like FastAPI, especially when customizing behavior.\nLess flexible serialization: DRF’s serializers work well for common cases, but customizing them for complex or non-standard data often demands verbose overrides.\nBest of the rest: Frameworks 7–10\nWhile the most popular Python frameworks dominate usage across the ecosystem, several others continue to thrive in more specialized domains. These tools may not rank as high overall, but they play important roles in backend services, data pipelines, and async systems.\n\nFrameworkOverviewAdvantagesDisadvantages\nhttpx\n2024 usage: 15% (+3% from 2023)Modern HTTP client for sync and async workflowsAsync support, HTTP/2, retries, and type hintsNot a web framework, no routing or server-side features\naiohttp\n2024 usage: 13% (+1% from 2023)Async toolkit for HTTP servers and clientsASGI-ready, native WebSocket handling, and flexible middlewareLower-level than FastAPI, less structured for large apps.\nStreamlit\n2024 usage: 12% (+4% from 2023)Dashboard and data app builder for data workflowsFast UI prototyping, with zero front-end knowledge requiredLimited control over layout, less suited for complex UIs.\nStarlette\n2024 usage: 8% (+2% from 2023)Lightweight ASGI framework used by FastAPIExceptional performance, composable design, fine-grained routingRequires manual integration, fewer built-in conveniences\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right framework and tools\nWhether you’re building a blazing-fast API with FastAPI, a full-stack CMS with Django, or a lightweight dashboard with Flask, the most popular Python web frameworks offer solutions for every use case and developer style.\nInsights from the State of Python 2025 show that while Django and Flask remain strong, FastAPI is leading a new wave of async-native, type-safe development. Meanwhile, tools like Requests, Asyncio, and Django REST Framework continue to shape how Python developers build and scale modern web services.\nBut frameworks are only part of the equation. The right development environment can make all the difference, from faster debugging to smarter code completion and seamless framework integration.\nThat’s where PyCharm comes in. Whether you’re working with Django, FastAPI, Flask, or all three, PyCharm offers deep support for Python web development.

This is a case of “just because you could doesn’t mean you should”.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! This newsletter is the home for recent .NET and software development related information.\n🌟 Featured Content\nThis month’s featured content is from Chris Woodruff! Chris has been at the forefront of software development since before the first .COM boom, building a career that spans enterprise web development, cloud solutions, software analytics, and developer relations. As an Architect, he applies his deep technical expertise to tackle complex challenges, with a particular focus on API design and scalable architectures. He is recognized as a Microsoft MVP specializing in .NET and Web Development. Woody’s impact extends beyond his professional responsibilities; he is a dedicated mentor and educator, teaching courses that help individuals transition into tech careers. His passion for sharing knowledge has made him a sought-after speaker at international conferences, where he discusses topics such as database development, web APIs, and software architecture. He contributes to the developer community by co-hosting The Breakpoint Show podcast and creating content that aids engineers in refining their skills.\nEntity Framework Core (EF Core) has emerged as the preferred Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for modern .NET developers. However, effectively utilizing it requires more than just familiarity with methods like .Add() and .SaveChanges(). This concise newsletter summarizes the essential insights from a full-day EF Core workshop (contact Woody for details below if interested), equipping you with the knowledge necessary to build fast, secure, and scalable data access layers.\nGetting Started with EF Core\nEF Core is a lightweight, extensible, and high-performance data access framework. It supports a clean code-first approach while allowing database-first flexibility when needed.\nKey Concepts:\n✅ DbContext is your gateway to the database. It manages connections change tracking, and query execution.\n✅ Use DbSet<T> to represent your entity collections.\n✅ Code-First is ideal for domain-driven development; use Fluent API to fine-tune schema mappings.\n💡Pro Tip: Always register your DbContext as Scoped. Avoid Singleton lifetimes to prevent memory issues and concurrency errors.\nModeling Relationships Like a Pro\nEF Core handles common relationship types easily, but it’s up to you to configure them correctly.\nModeling Must-Knows:\n✅ Define one-to-many with .HasMany().WithOne()\n✅ Use explicit foreign keys in your model for clarity.\n✅ Prefer eager loading (.Include()) for web APIs to avoid runtime surprises.\n💡Pro Tip: Don’t rely on lazy loading in APIs. It hides performance issues and can cause excessive database queries.\nQuerying with Power and Precision\nLINQ is a powerful abstraction, but be intentional.\nPerformance-First Query Tips:\n✅ Use .Select() to shape the result into DTOs, avoid sending entire entities.\n✅ Apply .AsNoTracking() for read-only queries to reduce memory use.\n✅ Chain .Where() and .OrderBy() before projection to reduce query size.\n💡Pro Tip: Avoid over-fetching by skipping unnecessary .Include() chains. Smaller queries are faster queries.\nSQL Server: Tune What EF Core Generates\nYou’re still writing SQL, it’s just hidden behind LINQ.\nSQL Server Optimization: \n✅ Use SSMS to inspect EF-generated SQL.\n✅ Read execution plans to diagnose slow queries.\n✅ Tune indexes based on frequent query filters or sorts.\n✅ Leverage Query Store to monitor historical query behavior\n💡Pro Tip: Computed columns and filtered indexes can supercharge performance when used intentionally.\nSecure Your Data Layer\nEF Core doesn’t protect you from bad design. Data security must be implemented in your access layer.\nSecurity Strategies:\n✅ Use DTOs to prevent overposting.\n✅ Filter by user role or claim inside the query, not afterward.\n✅ Never interpolate raw SQL, always parameterize inputs.\n✅ Store secrets securely: Use User Secrets in dev, Managed Identity in Azure.\n💡Pro Tip: Your DbContext is an attack surface. Secure it like you would any API.\nTesting EF Core with Confidence\nTesting EF Core doesn’t have to be painful, use the right tools.\nApproach by Test Type:\n✅ Use In-Memory provider for fast unit tests, but be aware it behaves differently from SQL Server.\n✅ Prefer SQLite in-memory for a closer match to production.\n✅ Use Testcontainers or local SQL Server for full integration testing.\n💡Pro Tip: Seed data should be scenario-specific and reset between tests. Use Respawn or EF-based seeding for consistency.\nScaling for the Cloud\nCloud-readiness means EF Core must handle concurrency, resiliency, and high throughput.\nCloud-Ready Practices:\n✅ Use DbContextPool for high-performance APIs.\n✅ Configure retry logic with EnableRetryOnFailure(), and even better, learn and use Polly, which is a library for .NET designed for resilience and transient-fault handling. It enables developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent, thread-safe manner.\n✅ Apply distributed caching at the service layer, not the EF level.\n✅ Use sharded/multi-tenant strategies carefully: filtered queries, schema separation, or even DB-per-tenant.\n💡Pro Tip: Azure SQL + EF Core is a battle-tested combo, just don’t forget to tune your retry strategies and monitor connection health.\nCommon Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\nEven experienced developers can fall into subtle traps when working with EF Core. Here are some of the most common mistakes, and how to dodge them in your projects.\n❌ Lazy Loading in APIs\nLazy loading can cause unexpected multiple queries per request. In web APIs, it often results in the dreaded N+1 problem.\n✅ Use Eager Loading or Projections\nExplicitly load related data with .Include() or shape the query using .Select() and DTOs.\n❌ Leaking Entities to the Client\nExposing EF entities directly in your controllers or UI tightly couples your domain to your database schema.\n✅ Use DTOs or ViewModels\nMap to dedicated types that represent what the consumer needs. Nothing more, nothing less.\n❌ Overusing .Include() Chains\nDeep includes may look convenient, but can result in massive SQL joins and redundant data loading.\n✅ Load Only What You Need\nBe intentional. Use shaped queries and projections for complex object graphs.\n❌ Ignoring Execution Plans and SQL Output\nIf you’re not inspecting the SQL your LINQ generates, you’re flying blind.\n✅ Use SSMS and Query Store\nAlways review generated SQL for critical paths. Use SQL Server tooling to optimize indexes and execution plans.\nReady to Go Deeper?\n👉 Explore Chris’s GitHub repo with all of his EF Core demos. \n🗣️ Need help applying this in production or want to discuss the workshop? Book some time or have a code review with Chris. \n🔗 Links\nHere’s the latest from the developer community.\nTechnical Coaching: From One Team to Many Teams 🎥 – Emily Bache\nWhy Most .NET Developers Don’t Need MediatR 🎥 – Gui Ferreira\n2code ^ !2code [S2025E11] Multi-targeting Roslyn Components – Part 1 🎥 – FlashOWare by Eva Ditzelmüller & Stefan Pölz\nThe #1 Reason Your Software System Gets Messy 🎥 – CodeOpinion by Derek Comartin \nSteve Smith on How Generative AI is the New Offshoring 🎥- Technology and Friends by David Giard\nStop Wasting Time: Use the 70/20/10 Rule to grow as a developer 🎙️ – Andrea Angella\nConverting an xUnit test project to TUnit – Andrew Lock\nImplementing BFF Pattern in ASP.NET Core for SPAs and BFF in ASP.NET Core #7 – Introducing the Duende BFF Library – Tore Nestenius\nExploring .NET MAUI: Popups, Messages, and Data Validation – Paul Sheriff\nMastering Incremental Source Generators in C#: A Complete Guide with Example – Ali Hamza Ansari\nCreating Trusted Document Containers with PDF/A-3b in .NET C# – Bjoern Meyer\nHow I Reduced API Response Time by 70% in a Large .NET Project – Ali Hamza Ansari\nEntity Framework or Dapper: which one is better for .NET/C#? – Denis Makarenko\nOptimizing ASP.NET Core Web Site Performance – Duende’s Need for Speed – Khalid Abuhakmeh\nHow to Apply SOLID Principles in AI Development Using Prompt Engineering – Jeyasri Murugan\n🔦 From our .NET Guide\nEach month we feature tutorials or tips from our .NET Guide.\nAzure Functions\nDeveloping and managing cloud solutions often requires a seamless and efficient workflow.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hold on to your helper methods – RubyMine is now FREE for non-commercial use! Whether you’re learning Ruby and Rails, pushing open-source forward, creating dev content, or building your passion project, we want to make sure you have the tools to enjoy what you do even more… for free.\nGet RubyMine for free\n                                                    \nAnother chapter in the story\nWe recently introduced a new licensing model for WebStorm, RustRover, Rider, and CLion – making them free for non-commercial use. RubyMine is now joining the party! For commercial use, our existing licensing model still applies.\nWhy are we doing this?\nWe believe developers do their best work when the right tools are accessible. We’ve been listening closely to the Ruby and Rails community – their feedback, success, challenges, and passion for building with joy. Now, we’re making a change that reflects what we’ve heard.\nBy making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, we hope to lower the barrier to starting and help more people write clean, confident Ruby code from day one. It’s our way of supporting the unique Ruby community – from those who choose Ruby for their projects to maintainers of gems and frameworks who contribute to the Ruby ecosystem. Whether you’re debugging at midnight, crafting clever DSLs, or launching your first Rails app, RubyMine is here to help you build smarter (and crash less).\nCommercial vs. non-commercial use\nAs defined in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, commercial use means developing products and earning commercial benefits from your activities. However, certain categories are explicitly excluded from this definition. Common examples of non-commercial uses include learning and self-education, open-source contributions without earning commercial benefits, any form of content creation, and hobby development.\nIt’s important to note that, if you’re using a non-commercial license, you cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics. We use this information to improve our products. The data we collect is exclusively that of anonymous feature usages of our IDEs. It is focused on what actions are performed and what types of functionality of the IDE are used. We do not collect any other data. This is similar to our Early Access Program (EAP) and is in compliance with our Privacy Policy.\nFAQ\nBelow are answers to the most common questions. Check out the full FAQ for more information.\nLicensing\nWhat features are included under the free license?\nWith the new non-commercial license type, you can enjoy a full-featured IDE that is identical to its paid version. The only difference is in the Code With Me feature – you get Code With Me Community with your free license.\nWhich license should I choose if I want to use RubyMine for both non-commercial and commercial projects?\nIf you intend to use RubyMine for commercial development for which you will receive direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation within the meaning of the definitions provided in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, you will need to purchase a commercial subscription (either individual or organizational). This license can then also be used for non-commercial development.\nHow do renewals and upgrades work now?\nNon-commercial subscriptions are issued for one year and will automatically renew after that. However, for the renewal to happen, you must have used the assigned license at least once during the last 6 months of the subscription period. If it has been more than 6 months since you last used an IDE activated with this type of license and the renewal did not occur automatically, you can request a new non-commercial subscription again at any time.\nAm I eligible for a refund if I’ve already bought a paid subscription but do non-commercial development?\nIf you’re unsure whether you qualify for a refund, you’ll find full details of our policy here. Please note that if you also work on projects that qualify as commercial usage, you can’t use the free license for them.\nAnonymous data collection \nDoes my IDE send any data to JetBrains?\nThe terms of the non-commercial agreement assume that the product may also electronically send JetBrains anonymized statistics (IDE telemetry) related to your usage of the product’s features. This information may include but is not limited to frameworks, file templates used in the product, actions invoked, and other interactions with the product’s features. This information does not contain personal data.\nIs there a way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics?\nWe appreciate that this might not be convenient for everyone, but there is unfortunately no way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics to JetBrains under the terms of the Toolbox agreement for non-commercial use. The only way to opt out is by switching to either a paid subscription or one of the complimentary options mentioned here.\nGetting a non-commercial subscription \nWhat should I do to apply for this subscription? \nIt can be easily done right inside your IDE:\nInstall RubyMine and run it.\nUpon startup, there will be a license dialog box where you can choose the Non-commercial use option.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nIf you’ve already started a trial period or have activated your IDE using a paid license, you still can switch to a non-commercial subscription by following these steps:\nGo to Help | Register.\nIn the window that opens, click on the Deactivate License button.\nChoose Non-commercial use.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nI don’t see the Non-commercial use option in my IDE. What should I do? \nThe most likely explanation for this is that you’re using an older version of RubyMine. Unfortunately, we don’t support obtaining the non-commercial license for any releases prior to RubyMine 2025.2.1.\nThat’s it for today! If you don’t find an answer to your question, feel free to leave a comment or contact us at sales@jetbrains.com.\nThe RubyMine team\nJetBrains\nMake it happen. With code.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Picture this: You’re working on your MSc thesis as an intern in software engineering, not just as an academic exercise, but side-by-side with an industry team, tackling real projects and real problems, refining code, and witnessing your ideas come alive. By the time you’ve graduated, you’re already a valued team member, ready to hit the ground running . \nIn a short series of posts, we will tell you about four recent graduates who have done exactly that, thanks to our AI for Software Engineering ( AI4SE ) research partnership with Delft University of Technology ( TU Delft ). Having recently completed their MSc thesis work as interns here at JetBrains, they are now starting full-time positions with us. \nThis first post will tell you a little about them and their experiences at JetBrains so far, and the second will go deeper into their new roles.\nIncoming AI4SE graduates to JetBrains \nWhile working on their MSc theses, these students got hands-on experience in the tech world. And now they’re full-time innovators sharing how their internships became the launchpad for their careers. Here are Milan, Nadine, Saga, and Sergey:\n\nMilan de Koning, Nadine Kuo, Saga Rut Sunnevudóttir, and Sergey Datskiv\nDuring their time as interns with us, they worked on projects covering various topics and contributed important research. For many of them, their work will grow into journal papers in the coming months. \nOur AI4SE Partnership\nThe AI4SE program merges academic research with industry collaboration. Together with our partners at TU Delft, we are committed to advancing cutting-edge research on the impact and utilization of AI methodologies in software engineering, focusing on areas such as software development, testing, and programming education.\nAI4SE was launched in 2023, and each year four to five students work together with researchers on topics within the five research tracks (more details on who is involved can be found on the AI4SE People  page). Several of our teams participate: Software Testing Research, HAX, Dynamic Program Analysis, Education Research teams; alongside teams from the TU Delft side: AISE and CISE research labs from the Software Engineering Research Group and the Center of Education and Learning . The program additionally is part of the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI).\nWhat it’s like to be an AI4SE intern at JetBrains\nOverall, the interns enjoyed the same status as full-fledged employees, with the encouragement to ask questions and present their own ideas. The environment is intellectually stimulating and the company culture is very supportive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI4SE students’ research topics\nThis cohort researched topics from different AI4SE tracks and worked with various JetBrains departments. \n“The opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology is something that I am very grateful for.”\n\n            \nMilan\n                                                        \nHere are more details on their thesis work:\nMilan’s thesis looked at data leakage, or when a model sees parts of the test data during training. For the thesis, he:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research team.\nUsed metamorphic testing, which changes code without altering its meaning, to reveal when models rely on memorization rather than true understanding.\nStudied how this can lead to inflated results in automated bug-fixing systems.\nNadine’s thesis involved designing and evaluating a proactive AI assistant in enterprise integrated development environments (IDEs), to supplement earlier related work confined to controlled laboratory settings. For the thesis, she:\nWorked within Track 3 and with our Human-AI eXperience (HAX) and Fleet teams.\nDeveloped a system that proactively suggests code improvements via in-editor cues and the AI Chat, based on heuristics for help-seeking moments. \nEvaluated the final design with an in-the-wild study, engaging professional developers to understand how timing, representation, and context influence user experience and perceptions.\nSaga’s thesis focused on evaluating the current status of state-of-the-art test generation tools for JavaScript and TypeScript. For the thesis, she:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research and  WebStorm teams. \nBuilt a benchmark for assessing these tools, specifically JetBrains AI Assistant.\nSergey’s thesis concerned improving the current state-of-the-art unit test-case generation approach with LLMs. For the thesis, he:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research team.\nStudied the possible challenges and benefits of using LLMs for test case generation and integration into existing tools.\nTips for incoming students\n“ It was inspiring to connect with like-minded peers who were also passionate about the future of AI in software engineering.”\n\n            \nNadine\n                                                        \nStarting an internship at a new company might be daunting. Here, our graduates share some tips for future interns on how to get the most out of their experience:\n\n\n\n\nFrom what we’ve seen so far, it’s clear that our graduates’ willingness to learn, ask questions, and jump right into challenging projects has created a rich experience both for them and for us. We look forward to sharing more about their experiences as they continue to grow with us. Stay tuned for Part II!\nIf you are a TU Delft student interested in joining AI4SE, contact Mitchell Olsthoorn for general questions about the thesis procedures, or reach out to the university track leads to learn about project opportunities.",

        "pubDate": "Mon, 01 Sep 2025 09:02:50 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "The way developers create plugins implementing the Language Server Protocol (LSP) in JetBrains IDEs is undergoing a significant shift. With PyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA adopting a unified distribution model, we’re removing a key obstacle that has been limiting LSP adoption within the IntelliJ Platform ecosystem. Starting with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.2, users can continue using a limited set of features, including the LSP API, even after their subscription expires. Community Edition (CE) will still be available in 2025.2 but will not include LSP support. See our other announcement to learn more.\nKey changes in LSP availability\nThe most important update affects how LSP functionality is distributed in JetBrains IDEs:\nImmediate impact (2025.2): The LSP API, which is already available to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate users, will now be accessible for free within a limited feature set when their subscription expires. This change addresses long-standing feedback from plugin developers and smaller language communities, ensuring users no longer need to consider licensing restrictions when choosing between platforms.\nFuture changes (2025.3): With the new unified distribution, the traditional Community Edition will be sunset. All users will download a single IntelliJ IDEA installer, with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate features requiring a subscription to be unlocked, but LSP support will remain available to everyone.\nThe LSP implementation itself stays closed-source and commercial, but we’ll keep it fully accessible for third-party plugins at no charge. This means plugin developers can now target a much broader user base without requiring their users to purchase the IntelliJ IDEA license.\nWhat does this mean for plugin developers \nThis change addresses one of the most persistent complaints from the developer community. Previously, plugins using the LSP were essentially limited to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate users, creating a significant barrier for:\nOpen-source plugin developers who wanted to provide LSP-based language support without restricting their user base.\nNiche language communities, where requiring a paid subscription made adoption impractical, especially for small teams or individual contributors.\nEducational environments, where managing different IDE editions added unnecessary complexity and friction.\nThe unified approach means plugin developers can now:\nBuild LSP-based plugins that work for users of all JetBrains IDEs.\nReduce the complexity of explaining installation requirements to users.\nCompete more effectively with competitors’ extensions, which have had universal LSP support.\nCurrent LSP capabilities and setup\nThe LSP API in the IntelliJ Platform has matured significantly since its introduction in 2023.2 and currently supports the following:\nCore language features:\nCode completion with resolve support\nGo to definition and type definition\nHover documentation\nFind references definition\nSemantic highlighting\nDiagnostics (both push and pull models)\nAdvanced features:\nCode actions and quick-fixes\nDocument formatting\nDocument links and color preview\nIntention actions\nWorkspace commands\nPlugin developers should target IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.2.1+ and include the optional dependency on the com.intellij.modules.lsp module in the plugin.xml file.\n<idea-plugin>\n  <depends optional=”true” config-file=\"lsp.xml\">com.intellij.modules.lsp</depends>\n</idea-plugin>\nTo ensure the plugin is only available for installation in 2025.2.1+ and later, specify the since-build property in your build.gradle.kts file with:\nintellijPlatform {\n    pluginConfiguration {\n        ideaVersion {\n            sinceBuild = \"252.25557\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nIf your project is based on the Plugin Template, set the relevant build number in the gradle.properties file:\npluginSinceBuild=252.25557\nTo integrate the Kotlin LSP, two components are needed:\nAn LSP server descriptor that specifies supported files and offers a command line to launch the server as a standalone process.\nAn LSP support provider that ensures the server is accessible for a given file.\nServer Descriptor\nThe following KotlinLspServerDescriptor creates an LSP support provider for the Language Server for Kotlin that handles Kotlin files (.kt extension). The provider will ensure that the language server runs in a separate process from the kotlin-lsp binary available in the PATH environment variable.\nprivate class KotlinLspServerDescriptor(project: Project)\n    : ProjectWideLspServerDescriptor(project, \"KN Kotlin LSP\") {\n\n    override fun isSupportedFile(file: VirtualFile) =\n        file.extension == \"kt\"\n\n    override fun createCommandLine() =\n        GeneralCommandLine(\"kotlin-lsp\", \"--stdio\")\n}\nLSP Support Provider\nCreate an LSP support provider that initiates the LSP server when needed, using the appropriate server descriptor.\nclass KotlinLspServerSupportProvider : LspServerSupportProvider {\n\n    override fun fileOpened(\n        project: Project,\n        file: VirtualFile,\n        serverStarter: LspServerSupportProvider.LspServerStarter,\n    ) {\n        if (file.extension == \"kt\") {\n            serverStarter.ensureServerStarted(\n                KotlinLspServerDescriptor(project)\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe LSP support provider must be registered in the plugin descriptor, next to the main plugin.xml, within the existing lsp.xml file.\n<idea-plugin>\n  <extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <platform.lsp.serverSupportProvider\n      implementation=\"com.example.KotlinLspServerSupportProvider\"/>\n  </extensions>\n</idea-plugin>\nYou can find the above LSP implementation as a Kotlin Notebook example here: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-notebook-intellij-platform/blob/master/examples/lsp.ipynb\nTrade-offs\nThe IntelliJ Platform documentation is clear about positioning: The LSP approach shouldn’t be considered as a replacement for the existing language API but rather as an added value. While LSP development offers significant advantages, such as reduced maintenance effort, faster development cycles, and cross-platform consistency, it is important to keep the following limitations in mind:\nLimited IDE integration: The LSP approach provides less access to the IntelliJ Platform’s robust native features, which are deeply integrated via the Program Structure Interface (PSI).\nPerformance considerations: Using an LSP-based plugin introduces communication overhead compared to native implementations.\nFeature parity gaps: Some advanced IDE features may not currently have LSP equivalents, limiting the scope for certain plugin developers.\nThe LSP serves as a practical, lightweight solution for plugin developers seeking to reduce complexity and expand their reach while delivering consistent language support. For those who need deeper integration with IntelliJ Platform features, native APIs like the PSI remain the preferred choice.\nGetting started with LSP development\nTo explore LSP integration, plugin developers should:\nReview the comprehensive documentation available in the IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK.\nExamine existing implementations like the open-source Prisma ORM plugin.\nStart with basic features and gradually add more sophisticated capabilities.\nPlan for the 2025.2 release to leverage universal LSP support.\nWrapping up and looking ahead\nRemoving commercial licensing for LSP integration on the IntelliJ Platform eliminates a significant problem for plugin developers, allowing them to prioritize efficiency and feature work.\nMore importantly, this shift represents more than a purely technical change; it underscores JetBrains’ recognition that language server development should be accessible to the broader developer community, not just those building commercial products.\nWhile LSP integration won’t replace every native API, it provides a practical, lightweight solution for delivering consistent language support across all JetBrains IDEs. This fosters competition and presents an opportunity for plugin creators to target a broader audience. With the 2025.2 release, plugin authors can now evaluate and adopt the LSP on its technical merits, free from licensing constraints.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Featuring Langfuse and W&B Weave Support, Ktor Integration, Native Structured Output, iOS Target, GPT-5, and More.\nKoog 0.3.0 was about making agents smarter and persistent. Koog 0.4.0 is about making them observable, seamlessly deployable in your stack, and more predictable in their outputs – all while introducing support for new models and platforms.\nRead on to discover the key highlights of this release and the pain points it is designed to address.\nLearn more\n🕵️ Observe what your agents do with OpenTelemetry support for W&B Weave and Langfuse\nWhen something goes wrong with an agent in production, the first questions that pop up are “Where did the tokens go?” and “Why is this happening?”. Koog 0.4.0 comes with full OpenTelemetry support for both W&B Weave and Langfuse.\nSimply install the desired plugin on any agent and point it to your backend. You’ll be able to see the nested agentic events (nodes, tool calls, LLM requests, and system prompts), along with token and cost breakdowns for each request. In Langfuse, you can also visualize how a run fans out and converges, which is perfect for debugging complex graphs.\nW&B Weave setup:\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    ...\n) {\n    install(OpenTelemetry) {\n        addWeaveExporter(\n            weaveOtelBaseUrl = \"WEAVE_TELEMETRY_URL\",\n            weaveApiKey = \"WEAVE_API_KEY\",\n            weaveEntity = \"WEAVE_ENTITY\",\n            weaveProjectName = \"WEAVE_PROJECT_NAME\"\n        )\n    }\n}\nThis will allow you to see the traces from your agent in W&B Weave:\n\n\n\n\nLangfuse setup:\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    ...\n) {\n    install(OpenTelemetry) {\n        addLangfuseExporter(\n            langfuseUrl = \"LANGFUSE_URL\",\n            langfusePublicKey = \"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\",\n            langfuseSecretKey = \"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"\n        )\n    }\n}\nThis allows you to see the agent traces and their graph visualisations in Langfuse:\n\n\n\n\nOnce everything is connected, head to your observability tool to inspect traces, usage, and costs.\n🧩 Drop-in Ktor integration to put Koog behind your API in minutes\nAlready have a Ktor server? Perfect! Just install Koog as a Ktor plugin, configure providers in application.conf or application.yaml, and call agents from any route. No more connecting LLM clients across modules – your routes just request an agent and are ready to go.\nNow you can configure Koog in application.yaml:\nkoog:\n  openai.apikey: \"$OPENAI_API_KEY:your-openai-api-key\"\n  anthropic.apikey: \"$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:your-anthropic-api-key\"\n  google.apikey: \"$GOOGLE_API_KEY:your-google-api-key\"\n  openrouter.apikey: \"$OPENROUTER_API_KEY:your-openrouter-api-key\"\n  deepseek.apikey: \"$DEEPSEEK_API_KEY:your-deepseek-api-key\"\n  ollama.enabled: \"$DEBUG:false\"\nOr in code:\nfun Application.module() {\n    install(Koog) {\n        llm {\n            openAI(apiKey = \"your-openai-api-key\")\n            anthropic(apiKey = \"your-anthropic-api-key\")\n            ollama { baseUrl = \"http://localhost:11434\" }\n            google(apiKey = \"your-google-api-key\")\n            openRouter(apiKey = \"your-openrouter-api-key\")\n            deepSeek(apiKey = \"your-deepseek-api-key\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nNext, you can use aiAgent anywhere in your routes:\nrouting {\n    route(\"/ai\") {\n        post(\"/chat\") {\n            val userInput = call.receive<String>()\n            val output = aiAgent(\n                strategy = reActStrategy(),\n                model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4_1,\n                input = userInput\n            )\n            call.respond(HttpStatusCode.OK, output)\n        }\n    }\n}\n🏛️ Structured output that actually holds up in production\nCalling an LLM and getting exactly the data format you need feels magical – until it stops working and the magic dries up. Koog 0.4.0 adds native structured output (supported by some LLMs) with a lot of pragmatic guardrails like retries and fixing strategies.\nWhen a model supports structured output, Koog uses it directly. Otherwise, Koog falls back to a tuned prompt and, if needed, retries with a fixing parser powered by a separate model until the payload looks exactly the way you need it to.\nDefine your schema once:\n@Serializable\n@LLMDescription(\"Weather forecast for a location\")\ndata class WeatherForecast(\n    @property:LLMDescription(\"Location name\") val location: String,\n    @property:LLMDescription(\"Temperature in Celsius\") val temperature: Int,\n    @property:LLMDescription(\"Weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy)\") val conditions: String\n)\nYou decide which approach fits your use case best. Request data from the model natively when supported, and through prompts when it isn’t:\nval response = requestLLMStructured<WeatherForecast>()\nYou can add automatic fixing and examples to make it more resilient:\nval weather = requestLLMStructured<WeatherForecast>(\n    fixingParser = StructureFixingParser(\n        fixingModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n        retries = 5\n    ),\n    examples = listOf(\n        WeatherForecast(\"New York\", 22, \"cloudy\"),\n        WeatherForecast(\"Monaco\", 29, \"sunny\")\n    )\n)\n👋 Introducing the new Koog target – iOS\nKoog is now available on iOS as part of our focus on Kotlin Multiplatform. Build your agent once and ship it to iOS, Android, and JVM backends – all with the same strategy graphs, tests, and observability hooks. Note: Please use Koog version 0.4.1 to build for iOS.\n🤔 Tune how models think with GPT-5 and custom parameters\nWant your model to think harder on complex problems, or say less in chat-like flows? Version 0.4.0 adds GPT-5 support and custom LLM parameters, including settings like reasoningEffort, so you can balance quality, latency, and cost for each call.\nval params = OpenAIChatParams(\n    /* other params... */\n    reasoningEffort = ReasoningEffort.HIGH\n)\nval prompt = prompt(\"test\", params) {\n    system(\"You are a mathematician\")\n    user(\"Solve the equation: x^2 - 1 = 2x\")\n}\nopenAIClient.execute(prompt, model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5)\n🔄 Fail smarter – production-grade retries for flaky calls and subgraphs\nIt’s inevitable – sometimes LLM calls time out, tools misbehave, or networks hiccup. Koog 0.4.0 introduces RetryingLLMClient, with Conservative, Production, and Aggressive presets, as well as fine-grained control when you need it:\nval baseClient = OpenAILLMClient(\"API_KEY\")\nval resilientClient = RetryingLLMClient(\n    delegate = baseClient,\n    config = RetryConfig.PRODUCTION  // or CONSERVATIVE, AGGRESSIVE, DISABLED\n)\nBecause retries work best with feedback, you can wrap any action (even part of a strategy) in subgraphWithRetry, approve or reject results programmatically, and give the LLM targeted hints on each attempt:\nsubgraphWithRetry(\n    condition = { result ->\n        if (result.isGood()) Approve\n        else Reject(feedback = \"Try again but think harder! $result looks off.\")\n    },\n    maxRetries = 5\n) {\n    /* any actions here that you want to retry */\n}\n📦 Out-of-the-box DeepSeek support \nPrefer DeepSeek models? Koog now ships with a DeepSeek client that includes ready-to-use models:\nval client = DeepSeekLLMClient(\"API_KEY\")\nclient.execute(\n    prompt = prompt(\"for-deepseek\") {\n        system(\"You are a philosopher\")\n        user(\"What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?\")\n    },\n    model = DeepSeekModels.DeepSeekReasoner\n)\nAs DeepSeek’s API and lineup of models continue to evolve, Koog gives you a simple and straightforward way to slot them into your agents.\n✨ Try Koog 0.4.0\nIf you’re building agents that must be observable, deployable, predictable, and truly multiplatform, Koog 0.4.0 is the right choice. Explore the docs, connect OpenTelemetry to W&B Weave or Langfuse, and drop Koog into your Ktor server to get an agent-ready backend in minutes.\n🤝 Your contributions make the difference\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to extend a huge thank-you to the entire community for contributing to the development of Koog through your feedback, issue reports, and pull requests!\nHere’s a list of this release’s top contributors:\nNathan Fallet added support for the iOS target.\nDidier Villevalois – added contextLength and maxOutputTokens to LLModel.\nSergey Kuznetsov – fixed URL generation in AzureOpenAIClientSettings.\nMicah – added the missing Document capabilities for LLModel across providers.\njonghoonpark – refined the NumberGuessingAgent example.\nAteş Görpelioğlu helped with adding tool arguments to OpenTelemetry events",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio power users love ReSharper’s deep analysis, but the cost has been the occasional UI hiccup that breaks the flow of work. In ReSharper 2025.2, analysis runs in a separate 64-bit worker out of Visual Studio’s UI process. Previously, ReSharper shared Visual Studio’s UI process, so long analyses could stall the UI thread. Now, Visual Studio keeps repainting while ReSharper crunches. \nWe tested this new approach on the Orchard Core solution. During Visual Studio launch, total UI freezes of 100 ms or longer fell from 26 s with ReSharper 2025.1.4 (in-process) to 10.1 s with ReSharper 2025.2 running out of process — a 61% reduction. The side-by-side UI-pause visualizer shows the experience during startup. Here’s how we measured it. \nTesting methods\nWe ran two measurements on the Orchard Core solution (about 223 projects). First, we used ETW MessageCheckDelay to detect UI freezes. For greater flexibility, we later switched to custom tooling that detects periods when the UI thread becomes unresponsive.\nWe then summed all UI freezes of 100 ms or longer occurring during Visual Studio launch, regardless of source.\nWe measured ReSharper 2025.1.4, ReSharper 2025.2 (in-process), ReSharper 2025.2 (out of process), and Visual Studio without any extension installed.\nStartup results – Visual Studio launch (100 ms or longer, all sources)\nThe graph below shows cumulative UI freezes of 100 ms or longer during Visual Studio startup: \n\n\n\n\nFor context, Visual Studio without ReSharper measured 6.3 s during Visual Studio startup in our lab. Deviation from our previous measurements is possible, as the tests were performed locally in different environments by different people using different methods. We are currently implementing even more optimizations for Out-of-Process mode.\nWhat changed under the hood\nMost analysis now runs out of process, so heavy work no longer blocks the Visual Studio UI thread.\nSmarter scheduling reduces contention during typing, completion, and navigation.\nCaches and indexes live in a separate process to avoid extra work inside Visual Studio.\nVisual comparison\nBelow is the side-by-side UI-pause visualizer demo, recorded in similar conditions to the previous table. It demonstrates opening and working in the Orchard Core solution on the same machine with both versions.\nLeft: ReSharper 2025.1.4 (in-process) · Right: ReSharper 2025.2 (out of process)\n\n\n\n\nThe bars at the bottom indicate intervals when the UI thread is unresponsive. A bar turns red when an interval is 100 ms or longer. During those times, typing or clicking in the IDE has no effect. At a glance, you’ll see fewer red bars on the right (out of process), indicating a smoother user experience.\nIf you’ve seen Visual Studio warn that ReSharper is slowing down your computer, Out-of-Process mode targets the root causes behind that warning, so you should now see fewer alerts.\nKnown limitations in 2025.2 (out of process)\nOut-of-Process mode still has some limitations, as it does not yet support the following functionality:\nAI-powered features\nDebugger integrations\nDPA, dotMemory, dotTrace, and dotCover integrations\nTemplate editor\nDiagramming tools\nWe’re actively working to bring these features into Out-of-Process mode, and you can follow our progress in YouTrack.\nLearn more about Out-of-Process mode and how to enable it on this page.\nWhat we’re improving next\nRight-click latency: Profiling highlighted hot spots in PsiFiles.GetPsiFiles and SqlInjectionPsiProvider.ComputeDataForFileContext. We’ve reduced the impact for 2025.2 and will continue to monitor them in real-world projects.\nMethodology and thresholds: We’ll keep validating on larger solutions and may adjust freeze thresholds as we learn more.\nTry it today\n\n\n\n\nThere are four ways to enable Out-of-Process mode in ReSharper 2025.2 or later.\nFrom the menu, go to Extensions | ReSharper | R# Out-of-Process and select Switch to Out-of-Process mode.\nFrom the menu, go to Extensions | ReSharper | Options | Environment | Products & Features and select Run ReSharper in a separate process (preview). When you click Apply, you may be prompted to restart ReSharper.\nUse the Go to action, Ctrl+Shift+A, and then simply type “Switch to Out-of-Process mode” and press Enter.\nIn the status bar (after you’ve enabled Out-of-Process mode at least once), click the R# Out-of-Process indicator and choose Switch to Out-of-Process mode.\nTo revert, you can use any of the paths above and select Switch to In-Process mode. If none of these work, you can start Visual Studio with /ReSharper.InProcess to temporarily revert to In-Process mode and save your choice in the options.\nPower user tip: Start Visual Studio with /ReSharper.OOP to launch directly in Out-of-Process mode.\nCall for feedback\nWhile we are encouraged by the results of our tests, we really want to know if the editor feels faster to you. We invite you to share frame drops, trace files, or even a quick screen recording GIF. We read every report.\nOptionally share anonymous usage statistics\nTo help us validate performance improvements at scale, you can opt in to ReSharper’s Usage Statistics program.\nOpt in: From the menu, go to Extensions | ReSharper | Options | Environment | Usage Statistics, check Participate anonymously in the Usage Statistics program, and then click Save.\nOnly aggregate, anonymous data is sent — no project names or source code. See the Options panel for details.Beyond raw speed, Out-of-Process mode helps ensure ReSharper remains a first-class bridge for Visual Studio users and a stepping-stone for anyone curious about our standalone IDE, Rider.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Writing effective prompts for AI tools can be time-consuming and challenging. Cement those efforts by leveraging reusable prompt files. These custom prompts allow for quick access at the prompt box, and they’re automatically stored and shared with your teammates to make it easy to multiply your Copilot successes.  \n\nReusable prompt files solve the prompt-writing challenge \nReusable prompt files let you write, save, and run prompts right inside Visual Studio. Simply craft your prompt in a .github/prompts/[title].prompt.md file, save it, and reference it whenever you need to engage Copilot. This means your best prompts are always at your fingertips—no more hunting through old files, emails, or notes. \nSpeed up your workflow and collaborate effortlessly \nWhether you work solo or as part of a team, reusable prompt files save you time working with Copilot. The files are shared in the repository, ensuring consistent results across your projects and making them available to your colleagues. Everyone can benefit from tested, effective prompts that accelerate understanding and solution discovery. The days of reinventing the wheel are over! \nTips for maximizing your reusable prompt files \nLeverage the awesome-copilot repository to get started with Microsoft and community contributed prompt files. \nUse #prompt: or the context menu to add prompts in the prompt box. You can add more specific content or simply run it. \nWrite your prompts in the prompt box to easily grab the prompt syntax for referencing files (#files:“filename.md”) and other context types. \nOrganize prompt files by topic, project, or workflow for easy access. \nReview and refine your most-used prompts regularly to keep them sharp and relevant. \nEncourage team members to contribute their most effective prompts, building a shared resource library. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions.  \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Boost Your Copilot Collaboration with Reusable Prompt Files appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

UiState를 활용해 데이터를 처리하도록 만들었고, 이때 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@Immutable</code>, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@Stable</code>을 붙여 사용하였다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nd\">@Immutable</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">data class</span> <span class=\"nc\">SomeUiState</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">val</span> <span class=\"py\">items</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nc\">ImmutableList</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nc\">String</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;,</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">val</span> <span class=\"py\">showProgress</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nc\">Boolean</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">val</span> <span class=\"py\">showPlaceholder</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nc\">Boolean</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n\n    <span class=\"k\">companion</span> <span class=\"k\">object</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        \n        <span class=\"kd\">val</span> <span class=\"py\">Default</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">SomeUiState</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">persistentListOf</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">showProgress</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">false</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">showPlaceholder</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">false</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n\n        <span class=\"kd\">val</span> <span class=\"py\">Placeholder</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nc\">Default</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">copy</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">showPlaceholder</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">true</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n            <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"nf\">persistentListOf</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"a\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"b\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>위와 같은 형태이다. 리컴포지션을 중요하게 생각하니 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">ImmutableList</code> 역시 사용한다.</p>\n\n<p>Compose는 일반적인 방식이며, Stateful, Stateless를 구분하여 사용하며</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>SomeRoute: Navigation에서 불러지는 화면</li>\n  <li>SomeScreen: Route에서 불러다 사용하는 내부의 internal fun SomeScreen()</li>\n  <li>SomeComponent: Screen을 조합하는 모든 구성 요소는 Component를 활용한다.\n    <ul>\n      <li>당연하지만 Component는 Stateless 형태로 작성해야 한다. 다만 모듈의 위치에 따라 data class를 전달받기도 한다.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>시나리오 기반 테스트</h2>\n\n<p>모든 ViewModel의 로직은 UnitTest를 포함하는데, <a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/taehwandev/android-mvvm-paeteonyi-jeobgeunbeob-2023-deuroideu-naiceu\">2023 드로이드 나이츠</a> 발표자료에서 일부 소개한 방식을 사용한다.</p>\n\n<p>아래와 같은 시나리오 기반의 코드가 가능하다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>사용자가 버튼을 누른다.</li>\n  <li>입력값이 있다면 flow를 진행하고, 그렇지 않다면 filter에 걸린다.</li>\n  <li>UiState 상 프로그레스를 실행한다.</li>\n  <li>동의 화면이(Alert/BottomSheet 등)이 뜨면 응답에 따라 동작이 달라진다.\n    <ul>\n      <li>Yes 진행하고 네트워크 통신을 시작한다.</li>\n      <li>No 진행을 중단하고 프로그레스를 원래 상태로 되돌린다.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>네트워크 응답에 따라\n    <ul>\n      <li>실패하면 서버에서 내려주는 Alert/Toast 등을 노출하고 프로그레스를 되돌린다.</li>\n      <li>성공하면 완료 처리한다.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>위의 모든 단계를 UnitTest에서 테스트하고 버튼의 복구까지 이어지는 UiState의 상태를 확인하는 식으로 개발하였다. 모두 완벽하진 않다. 다만 UiTest를 하지 않아도 UnitTest 만으로 어느 정도 범위에서 안정적인 서비스가 가능하다는 장점을 가진다.</p>\n\n<p>이런 테스트는 1,000개가 넘게 포함되어 있었다.</p>\n\n<h2>KSP를 활용한 Hilt Module 정의</h2>\n\n<p>메모리상 빠르게 사라질 수 있도록 하려고 Data 모듈에 대한 정의는 Activity 라이프사이클에 따르도록 만들었고, 정말 필요한 경우가 아니라면 싱글턴은 최소한으로 사용하였다.</p>\n\n<p>이런 부분도 자동화를 하고 싶었고, KSP를 활용해 자동화했다. 기존에는 Dagger를 활용하였는데, Hilt를 사용함으로써 더 간결해졌다.</p>\n\n<p>KSP를 활용해 Hilt 모듈을 자동으로 생성할 수 있도록 만들어 사용하였는데, <a href=\"https://github.com/taehwandev/Kilt\">Kilt(Kotlin + Hilt)</a>를 별도로 만들어 두었다.</p>\n\n<p><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@KiltGenerateModule</code>을 추가하면 자동으로 Hilt의 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@Module</code>을 만들어주는 역할을 한다.</p>\n\n<p>참고 : Dagger를 사용하면 사실상 빌드 시간이 더 단축된다.

        "contentSnippet": "+270만, -240만, 290개\n이건 내가 처음부터 끝까지 서비스 하나를 만들고 약 4년간 작성해본 코드 양이며, 모듈 숫자이다.\n혼자 서비스를 하면서 선택한 아키텍처 덕분에 안정적인 서비스를 해볼 수 있었다. 정승욱님이 발표한 코드 제로 관련에 나온 코드를 기반하여 수정하고 개선한 프로젝트를 사용했다.\n최근엔 iOS 개발도 약 10개월 진행하였는데 iOS TCA를 이해하면서 작성한 코드 역시 +46만 줄, -32만 줄 수정하였다.\n안드로이드 개발자가 본 iOS TCA 살펴보기\n이 글에서는\n4년간 서비스를 만들며 다듬어온 실용적인 모듈화 전략\n인터페이스 분리 원칙(ISP)을 적용해 빌드 속도를 개선한 경험을 소개\n시나리오 기반의 유닛 테스트 방법\n모듈화\n모듈화의 목적은 무엇일까? 클린 아키텍처를 사용하기 위해서는 모듈화를 해야 한다는 이야기가 있다.\n그렇지 않다. 필자의 모듈은 크게 4가지로 나뉜다.\nCore: UI를 제외한 기본 동작을 처리하는 모듈, 여기에는 테스트용 모듈도 포함된다.\nCore-App: 앱 내에서 사용하기 위한 디자인 시스템, UI를 포함하는 모듈이다. 이 역시 테스트 용도 모듈이 포함된다.\nData: 일반적으로 클린 아키텍처의 data, domain, data store 등을 포함한다.\nFeature: 화면을 기준으로 정리한 모듈\n2개의 Core를 나눈 이유는 완전 기본 동작을 위한 코드와 앱 내에서 UI를 포함하는 부분을 나누기 위함이다. 그 말은 core는 어디서든 사용할 수 있음을 뜻하는 완전 코어한 모듈이다.\nISP(인터페이스 분리 원칙)\n모든 코드는 인터페이스 분리 원칙을 기반한 모듈화 구성이다.\n다음 구성에 대한 참고 : 드로이드 나이츠 코드를 참고하면 이를 볼 수 있다.\ninterface를 정의하는 모듈 하나\n구현체를 정의하는 모듈\n테스트 시에 가져다 사용할 Fake 모듈\nFeature에는 interface를 기반하여 모든 코드를 구성하고, 테스트를 위한 fake 모듈을 기반하여 테스트를 진행할 수 있다.\n구현체 모듈을 수정하더라도 interface를 바라보는 모듈은 재빌드 대상에서 제외되기 때문에 더 빠른 개발이 가능한데, 일반적으로 1분에서 최대 3분 이내 빌드 가능해 빠른 개발이 가능했었다.\n이건 단순 모듈의 분리가 아닌 interface를 바라보도록 만든 구조 덕분에 가능했다고 생각한다.\n다만, core를 수정한다면 implementation이 feature의 구현체들이 참조하기 때문에 오랜 시간 걸릴 수 있다.\n서버에서 내려주는 오류에 따른 응답 처리\n서버 응답에 대한 처리는 서버에서 Alert/Toast 등의 노출도 제어할 수 있도록 개발하였다.\n이에 따라 Error 발생 시 모든 기본 응답은 서버에서 내려주는 대로 노출할 수 있게 되었다. 화면 별로 처음 로드하는 기준을 정하고, 재시도 가능한 형태를 구분하여 개발하였다.\n데이터\n네트워크 모듈의 interface를 주입받아 사용한다. 로컬 데이터는 앱의 성격상 정말 필요한 경우가 아니라면 사용할 일은 없다. 보통 금융 관련은 로컬에 데이터를 저장하는 선택보단 실시간 데이터가 더 중요하다.\n금융 앱의 특성상 데이터를 저장할 때는 기본 Android Keystore를 활용하여 저장하고 값을 꺼내 사용한다.\n도메인은 사용했나?\n도메인은 이전 글에서 작성했지만 클라이언트 아키텍처에 대한 단상 - ‘서버’가 진짜 ‘도메인’ 아닐까? 정말 필요하지 않은 이상 사용하지 않았다.\n1개 이상의 repository에 접근해서 서로 다른 데이터의 합이 필요한 경우 사용하였다. 지금 공부하는 개발자들은 안드로이드 아키텍처에 가깝다고 생각하겠지만, 지금까지 꾸준히 MVP > MVVM > 클린 아키텍처 적용을 해본 개발자들이라면 원래 그런 것 아니야? 라는 생각을 하는 것은 당연하다. 필자도 오랜 기간 단순 포워딩하는 것이 필요하지 않음을 알고 있다.\nView\n뷰와 뷰모델의 사용은 그냥 흔한 방식이다. UiState를 활용해 데이터를 처리하도록 만들었고, 이때 @Immutable, @Stable을 붙여 사용하였다.\n\n@Immutable\ndata class SomeUiState(\n    val items: ImmutableList<String>,\n    val showProgress: Boolean,\n    val showPlaceholder: Boolean,\n) {\n\n    companion object {\n        \n        val Default = SomeUiState(\n            items = persistentListOf(),\n            showProgress = false,\n            showPlaceholder = false,\n        )\n\n        val Placeholder = Default.copy(\n            showPlaceholder = true,\n            items = persistentListOf(\"a\", \"b\"),\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\n위와 같은 형태이다. 리컴포지션을 중요하게 생각하니 ImmutableList 역시 사용한다.\nCompose는 일반적인 방식이며, Stateful, Stateless를 구분하여 사용하며\nSomeRoute: Navigation에서 불러지는 화면\nSomeScreen: Route에서 불러다 사용하는 내부의 internal fun SomeScreen()\nSomeComponent: Screen을 조합하는 모든 구성 요소는 Component를 활용한다.\n    \n당연하지만 Component는 Stateless 형태로 작성해야 한다. 다만 모듈의 위치에 따라 data class를 전달받기도 한다.\n시나리오 기반 테스트\n모든 ViewModel의 로직은 UnitTest를 포함하는데, 2023 드로이드 나이츠 발표자료에서 일부 소개한 방식을 사용한다.\n아래와 같은 시나리오 기반의 코드가 가능하다.\n사용자가 버튼을 누른다.\n입력값이 있다면 flow를 진행하고, 그렇지 않다면 filter에 걸린다.\nUiState 상 프로그레스를 실행한다.\n동의 화면이(Alert/BottomSheet 등)이 뜨면 응답에 따라 동작이 달라진다.\n    \nYes 진행하고 네트워크 통신을 시작한다.\nNo 진행을 중단하고 프로그레스를 원래 상태로 되돌린다.\n네트워크 응답에 따라\n    \n실패하면 서버에서 내려주는 Alert/Toast 등을 노출하고 프로그레스를 되돌린다.\n성공하면 완료 처리한다.\n위의 모든 단계를 UnitTest에서 테스트하고 버튼의 복구까지 이어지는 UiState의 상태를 확인하는 식으로 개발하였다. 모두 완벽하진 않다. 다만 UiTest를 하지 않아도 UnitTest 만으로 어느 정도 범위에서 안정적인 서비스가 가능하다는 장점을 가진다.\n이런 테스트는 1,000개가 넘게 포함되어 있었다.\nKSP를 활용한 Hilt Module 정의\n메모리상 빠르게 사라질 수 있도록 하려고 Data 모듈에 대한 정의는 Activity 라이프사이클에 따르도록 만들었고, 정말 필요한 경우가 아니라면 싱글턴은 최소한으로 사용하였다.\n이런 부분도 자동화를 하고 싶었고, KSP를 활용해 자동화했다. 기존에는 Dagger를 활용하였는데, Hilt를 사용함으로써 더 간결해졌다.\nKSP를 활용해 Hilt 모듈을 자동으로 생성할 수 있도록 만들어 사용하였는데, Kilt(Kotlin + Hilt)를 별도로 만들어 두었다.\n@KiltGenerateModule을 추가하면 자동으로 Hilt의 @Module을 만들어주는 역할을 한다.\n참고 : Dagger를 사용하면 사실상 빌드 시간이 더 단축된다. Hilt는 수동으로 구성하던 많은 코드를 자동으로 만드는데 이 역할은 Android Studio의 플러그인이 해주고 있다. 다만 빌드 시간이 늘어날 수밖에 없다.(사실 Dagger일 때 1-2분이었지만 3분 이상으로 늘기도 했다)\n수많은 모듈\n수많은 모듈에서는 당연하지만 결국 모듈의 관리가 가장 중요하다.\nAndroid에서 효율적인 모듈 디펜던시 관리하기, build-logic으로 전환하기?\nbuild-logic을 사용하는 것은 어찌 보면 필수이다. 최소한의 코드를 사용하여 build.gradle.kts를 관리하여야 한다.\n그리고 필자는 사실상 App 모듈을 수정하지 않는 것을 선호한다. 사실 만들고 나면 고칠 일은 거의 없다. 모두 피처 모듈의 형태를 띠고 있으니 더더욱 수정할 일은 없다.\n그럼 implementation은 어떻게 하는가? 위 글에도 나오긴 하지만 이제 저 방식으로도 힘들다.\n그래서 수정한 코드 방식은 아래와 같다.\n\ndependencies {\n    rootProject.subprojects.filterProject {\n        implementation(it)\n    }\n}\n\n\n필터는 왜 필요한가? 모든 모듈이 하위에 바로 위치하는 것은 아니다. :폴더:폴더:모듈 의 형태를 가지는 경우가 더 흔하다. 그래서 filter를 통해 구분한다.\n\nfun Set<Project>.filterProject(\n    body: (target: Project) -> Unit,\n) {\n    forEach { project ->\n        if (project.name != \"app\" && project.buildFile.isFile) {\n            body(project)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n사실상 위에서부터 순서대로 settings.gradle.kts에 정의한 모든 모듈을 참조하기에 app 모듈이 아닌 경우를 구분해야 한다.\n어찌 보면 단점이다. 기존엔 그냥 특정 모듈을 바로 공통으로 접근할 수 있었는데, 그렇지 않아서 수정한 상태다.\n레거시 ViewModel에서 AAC-ViewModel로\nAAC-ViewModel을 사용하지 않았다. 이유는 굳이 써야 할 이유가 없었다.\n하지만 안드로이드 16이 나오면서 이제 AAC-ViewModel을 꼭 사용하긴 해야 한다. 그렇지 않다면 데이터 savedstate를 처리해 주어야 한다. 안드로이드 16부터는 폴더블 기기 600dp 부터 화면 회전이 강제화된다. 회전을 막는다고 하더라도 무시되고 동작한다.\n예외를 하면 회전했을 때 좌우에 여백을 공백으로 만들 뿐 회전을 막는 것 역시 아니다. 근데 최근에 이거 안 쓰는 개발자가 있을까 싶다.\niOS TCA\nTCA를 처음부터 한 것은 아니고 중간부터 투입되어 개발하게 되었다.\n안드로이드 개발자가 본 iOS TCA 살펴보기\nTCA는 리덕스로 작성되어 있다. 다행히도 안드로이드 개발에서 사용하던 플로우 이벤트 처리 방식을 그대로 이어가면서 개발이 가능하였다는 점이다. 적응하는 시간은 오래 걸렸다. 일반적으로 UiState를 리턴하는 리액트 방식과는 다르게 다음 액션을 전달하는 방식의 차이가 있다. 그래서 이후 안드로이드 아키텍처를 만들면서 소개한 내용과 이어진다.(블로그 글 참고)\n10개월이라는 짧은 기간 동안 TCA를 사용해보면서 느낀 점은 딱 하나. 오류 위치를 알려주지 않는다. 의외로 해결법은 간단한데, 코드를 분리해야 한다. 코드를 분리한다고 하여도 오류를 잘 알려주는 것은 아니다.\n그냥 어딘가 문법 오류가 있다. 끝. 일일이 주석 처리해 가면서 찾아야 한다. 다행히 런타임 오류가 아닌 것이 어디인가 싶다.\n그리고 또 하나 경험한 내용은 앱의 이름 덕분에 앱이 그냥 종료되어지는 오류도 만나보았다. 특정 버전의 OS에서만 오류가 발생하였다. 의심 가는 걸 Gemini와 GPT 둘 다에게 질문했지만 찾지 못했다. 결국 감으로 찾은 이유는 앱 이름이 겹쳐서였다는 사실이다.\n앱이 그냥 아무 이유 없이 꺼지는데 분석을 자세히 해보면 더 빨리 찾았겠지만 iOS 경험이 많지 않은 상태에서 AI가 없었다면 며칠 걸렸을지도 모르지만 다행히 하루 만에 이유를 찾고 해결해보았다.\n결국\n결국 요구사항을 잘 반영하는 코드를 만들고 싶은 욕심과 AI를 더 잘 활용하는 방법 등이 있다.\nTCA를 하면서 한 가지 느낀 점은 굳이 Data 모듈도 나누어야 할까? 라는 의문이다. 자동화를 통해 Data 모듈도 KSP로 JSON 통신하는 것을 만들고, 이것을 API 정의한 것에 연동하는 과정을 만들면 더 쉬운 개발도 가능하다는 점이다.\n그런 관점에서 이전에 작성한 도메인 관련 글의 인사이트를 다시 얻게 되었다.\n마무리\n약 4년 동안 입력한 코드 양만 합산 316만 줄이다. 여기에는 자동으로 생성되어지는 json이나 파일들이 있을 거니 이런 걸 제외하더라도 300만 줄의 코드를 쳤다는 것이긴 하다. 단순히 파일 이동도 있으니 더 제외하면 더 줄어들겠지만.\n코드양이 많다고 많은 걸 해본 것도 아니다. 그냥 즐겁게 코드를 입력하고, 이해하기 위해서 기존의 코드를 가져와 그대로 사용하지 않고 직접 입력하면서 이해하는 것을 우선하려고 노력하였다. 다행히 이를 통해 더 많은 코드를 수정하고 반영할 수 있었다.\n다만 누구나 이 코드를 수정할 수 있는가? 뷰는 가능하지만 core는 어렵다. 기본적인 이해를 바탕으로 하기에는 프레임워크를 이해해야 하는 것과 같다.",

마치 가게 문 앞에 멋진 간판이 없으면 손님들이 들어올 생각조차 하지 않는 것과 같아요. 제목은 독자와 검색엔진 모두에게 내 글의 첫인상을 결정하는 가장 중요한 요소입니다. 단순히 키워드를 나열하는 시대는 지났어요. 이제는 롱테일 키워드의 잠재력과 독자의 숨겨진 심리까지 파고드는 전략이 필요합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히 2025년에는 검색 알고리즘이 더욱 고도화되면서, 단순히 검색량 높은 키워드만 따라가는 방식으로는 한계가 명확해졌어요. 사용자의 <b>&lsquo;진짜 검색 의도&rsquo;</b>를 파악하고, 이를 제목에 녹여내는 것이야말로 죽어가는 키워드도 살려내고 상위 노출을 가능하게 하는 핵심 비법이 됩니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  기존 블로그 제목, 무엇이 문제일까요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 많은 블로그들을 분석하면서 느낀 점인데요, 많은 분들이 제목을 만들 때 몇 가지 공통적인 패턴을 보이시더라고요. 예를 들어, '손흥민 LAFC 이적설' 같은 주제를 다룬다고 할 때, 단순히 '손흥민 LAFC 이적설 정리'처럼 작성하는 경우가 많아요. 물론 나쁘다는 건 아니지만, 아쉽게도 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 좀 부족하다고 해야 할까요? 한번 기존 제목들의 일반적인 특징을 살펴볼게요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">기존 제목 분석 (일반적인 경향)</h3>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>핵심 키워드 중심:</b> 대부분 주제의 핵심이 되는 단어(예: 손흥민, 오이무침, 맥시부펜)만으로 제목을 구성하려는 경향이 강해요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>클릭 유도/특징 키워드 부족:</b> '공개', '비법', '간단한', '아삭하게' 등 사용자의 행동이나 감정을 유도하는 매력적인 단어들이 부족한 경우가 많아요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>구체적인 숫자/인물/고유 키워드 활용 미흡:</b> '백종원', '메시', 'BEST 50'처럼 신뢰나 호기심을 주는 구체적인 요소들이 잘 보이지 않아요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>자극적인 문구 지양:</b> 너무 자극적인 문구는 지양하지만, 반대로 너무 평범해서 클릭 욕구를 떨어뜨리는 경향도 있어요.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론적으로, 기존 제목들은 <b>정보 전달에는 충실하지만, 차별성이 부족하고 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 약하다</b>는 단점이 있어요. 검색 결과 페이지에서 수많은 경쟁 글들 사이에서 내 글을 돋보이게 만들기가 어렵다는 거죠.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>TIP:</b> 당신의 블로그 제목이 혹시 위에서 언급한 단점들을 가지고 있지는 않나요?

        "contentSnippet": "블로그 제목, 그냥 만드시나요? 2025년에는 검색엔진과 사용자 심리를 동시에 사로잡는 전략이 필수입니다. 죽은 키워드도 살려내는 롱테일 키워드와 사용자 의도 분석의 만남, 그리고 네이버 상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM) 활용 팁까지, 이 글 하나로 당신의 블로그 클릭률을 폭발적으로 끌어올릴 비밀을 공개합니다.\n  왜 블로그 제목 전략이 중요할까요?\n\n\n \n 블로그 글을 아무리 열심히 써도, 사람들이 클릭하지 않으면 아무 소용 없겠죠? 마치 가게 문 앞에 멋진 간판이 없으면 손님들이 들어올 생각조차 하지 않는 것과 같아요. 제목은 독자와 검색엔진 모두에게 내 글의 첫인상을 결정하는 가장 중요한 요소입니다. 단순히 키워드를 나열하는 시대는 지났어요. 이제는 롱테일 키워드의 잠재력과 독자의 숨겨진 심리까지 파고드는 전략이 필요합니다.\n특히 2025년에는 검색 알고리즘이 더욱 고도화되면서, 단순히 검색량 높은 키워드만 따라가는 방식으로는 한계가 명확해졌어요. 사용자의 ‘진짜 검색 의도’를 파악하고, 이를 제목에 녹여내는 것이야말로 죽어가는 키워드도 살려내고 상위 노출을 가능하게 하는 핵심 비법이 됩니다.\n  기존 블로그 제목, 무엇이 문제일까요?\n제가 많은 블로그들을 분석하면서 느낀 점인데요, 많은 분들이 제목을 만들 때 몇 가지 공통적인 패턴을 보이시더라고요. 예를 들어, '손흥민 LAFC 이적설' 같은 주제를 다룬다고 할 때, 단순히 '손흥민 LAFC 이적설 정리'처럼 작성하는 경우가 많아요. 물론 나쁘다는 건 아니지만, 아쉽게도 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 좀 부족하다고 해야 할까요? 한번 기존 제목들의 일반적인 특징을 살펴볼게요.\n기존 제목 분석 (일반적인 경향)\n핵심 키워드 중심: 대부분 주제의 핵심이 되는 단어(예: 손흥민, 오이무침, 맥시부펜)만으로 제목을 구성하려는 경향이 강해요.\n클릭 유도/특징 키워드 부족: '공개', '비법', '간단한', '아삭하게' 등 사용자의 행동이나 감정을 유도하는 매력적인 단어들이 부족한 경우가 많아요.\n구체적인 숫자/인물/고유 키워드 활용 미흡: '백종원', '메시', 'BEST 50'처럼 신뢰나 호기심을 주는 구체적인 요소들이 잘 보이지 않아요.\n자극적인 문구 지양: 너무 자극적인 문구는 지양하지만, 반대로 너무 평범해서 클릭 욕구를 떨어뜨리는 경향도 있어요.\n결론적으로, 기존 제목들은 정보 전달에는 충실하지만, 차별성이 부족하고 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 약하다는 단점이 있어요. 검색 결과 페이지에서 수많은 경쟁 글들 사이에서 내 글을 돋보이게 만들기가 어렵다는 거죠.\n  TIP: 당신의 블로그 제목이 혹시 위에서 언급한 단점들을 가지고 있지는 않나요? 지금 바로 확인해보세요!\n✨ 2025년형 블로그 제목 전략: 롱테일과 사용자 심리 분석\n그럼 이제 어떻게 해야 할까요? 2025년에는 롱테일 키워드의 힘과 사용자 심리 분석을 결합한 제목 전략이 필요합니다. 상위 노출에 최적화된 제목은 단순히 정보를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 독자의 문제를 해결해주고, 궁금증을 자극하며, 명확한 가치를 제안해야 해요.\n롱테일 키워드, 왜 중요할까요?\n롱테일 키워드는 검색량은 적지만, 특정 의도를 가진 사용자가 검색할 확률이 높고 경쟁이 덜한 키워드를 말해요. 예를 들어, '블로그 제목'보다 '초보 블로거를 위한 클릭률 높이는 블로그 제목 전략'이 롱테일 키워드에 해당하죠. 이런 키워드를 공략하면 적은 노력으로도 상위 노출의 기회를 잡을 수 있답니다.\n사용자 심리 분석, 어떻게 제목에 녹여낼까요?\n사용자 심리 분석은 크게 세 가지 질문으로 시작해요.\n사용자의 문제점(Pain Point)은 무엇인가? (예: 블로그 제목을 어떻게 지어야 할지 모르겠다)\n사용자가 원하는 해결책은 무엇인가? (예: 클릭률이 높은 제목을 만들고 싶다)\n내 글이 제공하는 특별한 가치(Value Proposition)는 무엇인가? (예: 2025년형 최신 전략, GEM 활용 비법)\n이 세 가지 질문에 대한 답을 제목에 응축하여 담아내는 거죠. 정말 쉽지 않죠? 그래서 제가 오늘 아주 특별한 도구를 소개해 드리려고 합니다.\n  상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM) 활용 가이드\n네이버에서 제공하는 ‘상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM)’는 제가 위에서 설명한 복잡한 분석 과정을 자동으로 수행하여 최적의 제목을 제안해주는 정말 강력한 도구예요. 저도 블로그 글을 쓸 때 자주 활용하는데, 정말 만족도가 높았어요. 이 도구를 어떻게 활용하면 좋을지 구체적으로 알려드릴게요.\n \nGEM 만들기\n1. 새 GEM 만들기 : GEMINI 좌측 메뉴 - Gems 탐색하기 -  '+ 새 Gem' 버튼을 클릭합니다. \n\n\n \n2. GEM 생성 : 제목을 입력하고, 본문 아래 첨부된 TEXT 파일의 모든 내용을 요청사항에 붙여넣고 저장하면 GEM 이 만들어 집니다.\n\n\n \n \nGEM 활용\n프로세스 (네이버 Creator Advisor 연동)\n1. Creator Advisor 방문: 먼저 creator-advisor.naver.com에 접속해서 현재 트렌드 키워드와 관련 네이버 블로그 상위 기사 제목들을 파악하세요. 시장의 흐름과 경쟁 블로그들의 전략을 엿볼 수 있는 아주 좋은 기회예요. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n2. 주제 및 핵심 키워드 입력:  위의 제목 리스트를 캡쳐한후  GEM 실행후 업로드 하고 엔터만 하면!!\n3. GEM의 기존 제목 분석: GEM은 입력된 정보를 바탕으로 기존 제목들의 공통점을 분석해줍니다. 핵심 키워드, 클릭 유도 키워드, 구체적인 정보, 자극적인 문구 등을 카테고리별로 분류해서 보여줄 거예요. 이 부분이 정말 유용해요! 내 제목에 어떤 요소가 부족했는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있거든요. \n4. 최적화 제목 제안: 분석 결과를 토대로, GEM은 상위 노출에 최적화된 새로운 제목 대안 3가지를 제시합니다. 단순히 키워드 조합이 아니라, 앞서 설명했던 사용자의 Pain Point, 해결책, 가치 제안이 녹아든 제목들이에요. 각 제안별로 어떤 강점이 있는지 구체적으로 설명해줘서 왜 그 제목이 효과적인지 바로 이해할 수 있어요.\n\n\n\n4. 최종 제목 선택 및 개선: 제시된 제목들 중에서 가장 마음에 드는 것을 선택하거나, 또는 이를 바탕으로 나만의 개성을 담아 조금 더 다듬어 최종 제목으로 확정합니다. GEM이 준 제목을 그대로 써도 좋지만, 내 목소리를 더하면 더 좋겠죠!\n⚠️ 주의: GEM은 강력한 도구지만, 맹신은 금물! 도구의 제안을 참고하되, 최종적으로는 자신의 글 내용과 독자의 특성을 가장 잘 이해하는 블로거인 당신의 판단이 중요합니다.\n  분석 기반 상위 노출 최적화 제목 제안 (예시)\n위에서 설명드린 GEM의 프로세스를 거쳐 제가 직접 몇 가지 제목들을 생성해봤어요. 단순히 정보를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 신뢰도와 객관성을 향상시키고, 사용자의 Pain Point를 해결하여 완결성 있는 가치를 제안하는 제목들입니다.\n제안 1 (가장 추천): 문제 해결 및 가치 제안 강조 스타일\n2025 블로그 제목, 죽은 키워드도 살리는 롱테일 & 심리 분석 필승 전략\n강점: '2025'로 최신성을 강조하고, '죽은 키워드도 살리는'이라는 자극적인 문구로 독자의 호기심과 문제 해결 욕구를 동시에 자극합니다. '필승 전략'으로 해결책에 대한 기대감을 높여요.\n강점: '롱테일'과 '심리 분석'이라는 핵심 키워드를 명확히 제시하여 글의 전문성과 가치를 드러냅니다.\n제안 2: 구체적인 방법론 제시 및 전문가적 신뢰 강조 스타일\n클릭률 300% 상승? 롱테일과 사용자 의도 분석으로 블로그 제목 마스터하기\n강점: '클릭률 300% 상승?'이라는 구체적인 수치와 질문 형식으로 독자의 궁금증과 성과에 대한 기대를 불러일으킵니다.\n강점: '롱테일과 사용자 의도 분석'으로 핵심 방법론을 명확히 제시하고, '블로그 제목 마스터하기'로 최종적인 목표와 전문성을 강조해요.\n제안 3: 독자의 Pain Point 공감 및 실용적 해결책 제시 스타일\n“내 블로그 글 왜 안 읽지?” 네이버 상위 1%만 아는 제목 공식 대공개!\n강점: 독자의 흔한 고민을 직접적인 질문('내 블로그 글 왜 안 읽지?')으로 제시하여 강한 공감대를 형성합니다.\n강점: '네이버 상위 1%만 아는'이라는 희소성과 비밀스러운 정보에 대한 기대감을 높여 클릭을 유도합니다. '제목 공식 대공개'로 명확한 해결책을 제시해요.\n  핵심 요약\n1. 제목은 블로그의 얼굴: 단순히 정보 전달을 넘어 클릭을 유도하는 첫인상이자 검색엔진 최적화의 핵심입니다.\n2. 롱테일 키워드의 힘: 경쟁은 적고 의도는 명확한 롱테일 키워드로 상위 노출의 기회를 잡으세요.\n3. 사용자 심리 분석: 독자의 문제점, 원하는 해결책, 글의 특별한 가치를 제목에 녹여내세요.\n4. GEM으로 제목 마스터: 네이버 상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM)를 활용해 효율적으로 최적의 제목을 찾아보세요.\n이 핵심 전략들을 통해 당신의 블로그 글이 더 많은 독자에게 가닿고, 더 큰 영향력을 발휘하기를 바랍니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 롱테일 키워드는 어떻게 찾나요?\nA1: 네이버 키워드 도구나 구글 키워드 플래너, 그리고 네이버 Creator Advisor 같은 도구를 활용하여 핵심 키워드와 연관된 확장 검색어들을 찾아볼 수 있습니다. 실제 사용자들이 어떤 질문을 하는지 파악하는 것이 중요해요.\nQ2: GEM이 제시한 제목을 꼭 그대로 사용해야 하나요?\nA2: 아니요, GEM은 최적화된 제목을 제안하는 도우미 역할을 합니다. 제안된 제목을 바탕으로 자신의 글의 개성과 문체에 맞춰 조금 더 다듬거나, 아이디어를 얻어 새로운 제목을 창조하는 것도 좋은 방법이에요.\nQ3: 모든 블로그 글에 제목 전략을 적용해야 하나요?\nA3: 네, 가능하면 모든 글에 적용하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 검색 유입이 중요한 정보성 글이나 리뷰 글의 경우, 제목 전략이 클릭률과 상위 노출에 결정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 꾸준한 적용이 중요해요.\n자, 이제 2025년 블로그 제목 전략의 핵심과 GEM 활용법까지 모두 아셨으니, 여러분의 블로그 글이 더 많은 독자들에게 사랑받을 일만 남았네요! 이 전략들을 꾸준히 적용해서 여러분의 블로그가 상위 노출의 꿈을 이루시길 진심으로 응원합니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n \n\n    \n\n    \ngem 지침.txt\n0.00MB",

(VS 포토샵)</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">혹시 이런 생각 해보셨을 수도 있어요. \"이런 기능들, 포토샵 같은 전문 이미지 편집 프로그램으로도 할 수 있는 거 아닌가?\" 네, 맞아요. 기존 툴로도 할 수 있는 작업들이었죠. 하지만 여기서 우리가 주목해야 할 <b>결정적인 차이점들</b>이 있습니다. AI가 가져온 혁신이 무엇인지 명확히 알 수 있는 부분이에요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 압도적인 작업 시간 단축</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">가장 먼저 체감할 수 있는 차이는 <b>작업 시간의 엄청난 격차</b>입니다. 포토샵에서 한 사람의 얼굴 표정을 바꾸려면 숙련된 디자이너라도 몇 시간은 걸릴 작업일 겁니다. 그런데 나노바나나는 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘\"라고 한 마디만 하면 <b>10초 안에 결과</b>를 보여줍니다. 이게 바로 AI의 힘이자, 우리가 AI를 주목해야 하는 이유죠.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. 전문가 수준의 기술적 난이도 해소</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">두 번째는 <b>기술적 난이도</b>입니다. 포토샵으로 자연스러운 합성을 하려면 조명, 그림자, 색온도, 원근감까지 모든 요소를 수동으로 맞춰야 합니다. 이건 전문 지식과 경험이 없으면 불가능에 가까운 작업이에요. 나노바나나는 이 모든 것을 <b>AI가 알아서 계산하고 처리</b>해줍니다. 일반 사용자 입장에서는 정말 꿈같은 일이죠.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. 무한한 창의적 가능성 확장</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">마지막은 <b>창의적 가능성</b>입니다. 포토샵은 '기존 편집' 도구에 가깝지만, 나노바나나는 '없던 것을 새로 만들어내는' <b>생성형 AI</b>예요. \"이 사람을 중세 시대 기사로 만들어줘\"라고 입력하면, 갑옷부터 배경까지 모든 것을 새로 생성해서 자연스럽게 합성해줍니다. 포토샵으로는 상상하기 힘들 정도로 복잡한 작업이죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>  핵심 포인트:</b> 나노바나나는 <b>속도, 쉬운 접근성, 무한한 생성력</b> 면에서 기존 툴을 압도합니다. 전문 지식 없이도 높은 퀄리티의 결과물을 얻을 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 매력이죠.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>⚠️ 주의해야 할 점도 있어요</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">물론 나노바나나가 혁신적인 도구인 건 분명하지만, 만능은 아닙니다. AI 기반 도구들이 가진 <b>몇 가지 주의할 점</b>들도 분명히 존재해요. 이 점들을 잘 이해하고 사용한다면 훨씬 더 스마트하게 나노바나나를 활용할 수 있을 거예요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 정확성과 일관성 문제</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">포토샵은 사용자가 원하는 대로 정확히 조작할 수 있지만, AI는 가끔 <b>예상과 다른 결과</b>를 만들어내기도 해요. 복잡한 요구사항일수록 원하는 결과를 얻기까지 여러 번 시도하거나 프롬프트를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. 세밀한 컨트롤의 한계</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">포토샵은 픽셀 단위로 정밀하게 수정 가능하지만, AI는 아직 그 정도의 <b>세밀한 조정 능력</b>은 부족합니다. 전체적인 느낌은 훌륭하지만, 특정 부분의 디테일한 요청은 한계가 있을 수 있어요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. 예측 불가능성</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">같은 프롬프트를 입력해도 AI는 매번 <b>조금씩 다른 결과</b>를 내놓을 수 있습니다. 이것이 창의성 측면에서는 장점이지만, 정확히 예측 가능한 결과가 필요한 작업에서는 단점이 될 수 있죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론적으로, AI 이미지 편집은 <b>빠르고, 쉽고, 창의적인 작업</b>에는 혁신적입니다. 하지만 정밀하고 예측 가능한 전문 작업에서는 기존 툴들과 <b>함께 사용하는 것이 현명</b>하다고 생각해요. 특히 우리 같은 일반 사용자들에게는 나노바나나 같은 AI 도구가 정말 <b>게임 체인저</b>가 될 수 있다는 사실은 변함없죠. 무료로 사용할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  나노바나나로 나만의 앱 만들기: 두 가지 접근법</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이렇게 강력한 나노바나나 기능을 활용해서 나만의 AI 앱을 직접 만들어 볼 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 저는 두 가지 방법으로 접근해봤고, 과정이 정말 흥미로웠답니다!</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1.

AI 이미지 작업에 관심 있는 분들이라면 이 글을 통해 놀라운 신세계를 경험하게 되실 겁니다.\n  나노바나나, 과연 무엇일까요?\n\n\n여러분, 혹시 나노바나나라는 이름을 들어보셨나요? 이름만 들어도 뭔가 귀엽고 동시에 최첨단 느낌이 들죠? 사실 이 매력적인 이름은 구글이 공식 발표한 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image 모델에 커뮤니티에서 붙여준 별명이에요. 왜 하필 '나노바나나'인지는 정확히 알려지지 않았지만, 확실히 더 친숙하게 느껴지는 건 저뿐만이 아닐 겁니다.\n중요한 점은 나노바나나가 단순히 이미지를 생성하는 수준을 넘어섰다는 거예요. 기존 AI 이미지 도구들과는 차원이 다른 성능을 보여줍니다. 텍스트 기반 생성 및 편집 기능이 업그레이드되었을 뿐만 아니라, 특히 캐릭터 일관성 유지와 다중 이미지 합성 능력을 혁신적으로 강화했죠. 이제 어떤 놀라운 일들을 할 수 있는지 구체적으로 파고들어 볼까요?\n✨ 나노바나나의 핵심 기능 3가지\n1. 놀라운 캐릭터 일관성 유지\n이 기능은 정말 많은 분들이 기다려왔던 혁신일 거예요. 기존 AI 도구들은 같은 캐릭터를 여러 장면에서 그릴 때마다 얼굴이 미묘하게 달라지는 문제가 있었거든요. 마치 쌍둥이인데 디테일이 조금씩 다른 느낌이랄까요? 나노바나나는 이 문제를 완전히 해결했습니다!\n비밀은 '정체성 임베딩 고정 기술'에 있습니다. 캐릭터의 얼굴 윤곽, 눈코입 비율, 헤어스타일, 의상 특징 등을 디지털 지문처럼 저장하고, 새로운 장면을 만들 때마다 이 지문을 참조해서 동일한 캐릭터를 완벽하게 유지하는 거죠. 예를 들어, 원본 캐릭터에게 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘. 안경을 씌워줘.\"라고 명령하면, AI는 캐릭터의 고유 지문에 웃는 표정과 안경을 자연스럽게 적용해준답니다. 정말 대단하지 않나요?\n2. 여러 이미지를 하나로 합치는 마법 같은 합성 능력\n두 번째 핵심 기능은 다중 이미지 합성 능력입니다. 예를 들어, 가족사진과 환상적인 풍경 사진이 있다고 해보세요. 나노바나나에게 \"이 가족을 저 배경에 자연스럽게 배치해줘\"라고 요청하면, AI는 조명, 그림자, 원근감까지 모두 고려해서 원래부터 그 배경에서 찍었던 것처럼 완벽하고 자연스러운 합성 이미지를 만들어줍니다. 합성 티가 전혀 나지 않는다는 게 정말 핵심이죠.\n3. 오차 없는 정확한 텍스트 표현\n마지막은 이미지 내 텍스트를 정확하게 표현하는 능력입니다. 기존 AI 이미지 도구들은 글자를 넣어달라고 하면 뒤틀리거나 깨지는 경우가 많았어요. 하지만 나노바나나는 로고, 포스터, 간판 등 어떤 시각물을 만들 때도 글자를 정확하고 깔끔하게 넣어줍니다.\n예를 들어, 특정 웨비나 안내 포스터를 \"텍스트는 영어로\" 지정해서 만들어달라고 하면, 텍스트 내용까지 정확하게 반영된 이미지를 생성해줍니다. 아직 한글 렌더링은 지원하지 않지만, 현재 결과물을 보면 조만간 한글도 완벽하게 지원할 날이 머지않았다는 생각이 들어요. 정말 기대되는 부분이죠.\n  나노바나나, 기존 툴과 무엇이 다를까? (VS 포토샵)\n혹시 이런 생각 해보셨을 수도 있어요. \"이런 기능들, 포토샵 같은 전문 이미지 편집 프로그램으로도 할 수 있는 거 아닌가?\" 네, 맞아요. 기존 툴로도 할 수 있는 작업들이었죠. 하지만 여기서 우리가 주목해야 할 결정적인 차이점들이 있습니다. AI가 가져온 혁신이 무엇인지 명확히 알 수 있는 부분이에요.\n1. 압도적인 작업 시간 단축\n가장 먼저 체감할 수 있는 차이는 작업 시간의 엄청난 격차입니다. 포토샵에서 한 사람의 얼굴 표정을 바꾸려면 숙련된 디자이너라도 몇 시간은 걸릴 작업일 겁니다. 그런데 나노바나나는 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘\"라고 한 마디만 하면 10초 안에 결과를 보여줍니다. 이게 바로 AI의 힘이자, 우리가 AI를 주목해야 하는 이유죠.\n2. 전문가 수준의 기술적 난이도 해소\n두 번째는 기술적 난이도입니다. 포토샵으로 자연스러운 합성을 하려면 조명, 그림자, 색온도, 원근감까지 모든 요소를 수동으로 맞춰야 합니다. 이건 전문 지식과 경험이 없으면 불가능에 가까운 작업이에요. 나노바나나는 이 모든 것을 AI가 알아서 계산하고 처리해줍니다. 일반 사용자 입장에서는 정말 꿈같은 일이죠.\n3. 무한한 창의적 가능성 확장\n마지막은 창의적 가능성입니다. 포토샵은 '기존 편집' 도구에 가깝지만, 나노바나나는 '없던 것을 새로 만들어내는' 생성형 AI예요. \"이 사람을 중세 시대 기사로 만들어줘\"라고 입력하면, 갑옷부터 배경까지 모든 것을 새로 생성해서 자연스럽게 합성해줍니다. 포토샵으로는 상상하기 힘들 정도로 복잡한 작업이죠.\n  핵심 포인트: 나노바나나는 속도, 쉬운 접근성, 무한한 생성력 면에서 기존 툴을 압도합니다. 전문 지식 없이도 높은 퀄리티의 결과물을 얻을 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 매력이죠.\n⚠️ 주의해야 할 점도 있어요\n물론 나노바나나가 혁신적인 도구인 건 분명하지만, 만능은 아닙니다. AI 기반 도구들이 가진 몇 가지 주의할 점들도 분명히 존재해요. 이 점들을 잘 이해하고 사용한다면 훨씬 더 스마트하게 나노바나나를 활용할 수 있을 거예요.\n1. 정확성과 일관성 문제\n포토샵은 사용자가 원하는 대로 정확히 조작할 수 있지만, AI는 가끔 예상과 다른 결과를 만들어내기도 해요. 복잡한 요구사항일수록 원하는 결과를 얻기까지 여러 번 시도하거나 프롬프트를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n2. 세밀한 컨트롤의 한계\n포토샵은 픽셀 단위로 정밀하게 수정 가능하지만, AI는 아직 그 정도의 세밀한 조정 능력은 부족합니다. 전체적인 느낌은 훌륭하지만, 특정 부분의 디테일한 요청은 한계가 있을 수 있어요.\n3. 예측 불가능성\n같은 프롬프트를 입력해도 AI는 매번 조금씩 다른 결과를 내놓을 수 있습니다. 이것이 창의성 측면에서는 장점이지만, 정확히 예측 가능한 결과가 필요한 작업에서는 단점이 될 수 있죠.\n결론적으로, AI 이미지 편집은 빠르고, 쉽고, 창의적인 작업에는 혁신적입니다. 하지만 정밀하고 예측 가능한 전문 작업에서는 기존 툴들과 함께 사용하는 것이 현명하다고 생각해요. 특히 우리 같은 일반 사용자들에게는 나노바나나 같은 AI 도구가 정말 게임 체인저가 될 수 있다는 사실은 변함없죠. 무료로 사용할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.\n  나노바나나로 나만의 앱 만들기: 두 가지 접근법\n이렇게 강력한 나노바나나 기능을 활용해서 나만의 AI 앱을 직접 만들어 볼 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 저는 두 가지 방법으로 접근해봤고, 과정이 정말 흥미로웠답니다!\n1. '바이브 코딩 아이디어 챗봇' 활용\n\n\n\n\n'바이브 코딩 아이디어 챗' 실행 후, 나노바나나의 새 기능(일관성 유지, 자연스러운 합성, 정밀 수정)을 활용한 앱 아이디어(원본 사진 업로드 후 합성/복원/컬러화)를 요청했습니다.\n챗봇과 대화하며 앱 제작 질문 10개를 완성, 이를 복사하여 AI STUDIO의 BUILD에 순차적으로 입력했습니다. (한 번에 다 넣기보단 한두 개씩 빌드업 추천!)\n처음엔 UI가 영어로, 합성 기능에 에러가 있었지만, '한국어 버전으로 변경', '프롬프트 결과를 흰색으로 변경', 'Auto Fix' 기능 등을 활용해 해결했습니다. 사진 복원 기능도 나중에 복원, 컬러화, 업스케일 기능을 추가 요청하여 완성했죠. 바이브 코딩은 때론 디버깅이 필요하답니다.\n바이브코딩 아이디어 챗 + 나노바나나 활용 앱 바로가기\n \n2. 구글 나노바나나 프롬프트 가이드 기반 제작\n\n\n\nAI STUDIO 설정에서 나노 이미지 문서 페이지로 이동, '프롬프트 엔지니어링' 섹션의 가이드 내용을 메모장에 저장했습니다.\nBUILD 섹션에서 저장한 가이드를 업로드하고 \"첨부 문서를 분석하고, 문서에 포함된 모든 이미지 생성, 편집과 프롬프트 기법이 반영된 한글 앱을 만들어\"라고 요청했습니다.\n프롬프트 가이드 기반 앱도 잘 작동하는 것을 확인했어요. 바이브 코딩은 직접 요청, 디자인 제공, 문서 학습 등 다양한 방식으로 사용자가 원하는 결과를 얻을 수 있도록 돕는 유연한 플랫폼입니다.\n \n나노바나나 프로프트 엔지니어링 가이드 활용한 앱 바로가기\n \n  바나나 캔버스 무료 공개! 스마트 이미지 작업의 시작\n\n\n이런 과정을 거쳐 제가 만든 앱이 바로 '바나나 캔버스'입니다. 이 앱은 구글의 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image (나노바나나)와 이마젠 4.0을 기반으로 한 올인원 이미지 생성 및 편집 도구예요. 직접 써보니 정말 상상 이상의 편리함을 제공하더군요.\n바나나 캔버스는 텍스트 설명만으로 이미지를 창조하고, 기존 이미지를 전문가 수준으로 편집하며, 여러 이미지를 창의적으로 합성하는 등 다채로운 시각적 작업을 지원합니다. 핵심 차별점은 강력한 '프롬프트 제안' 기능이에요. AI가 사용자의 의도를 분석해 최적의 지시문을 자동 생성해주므로, 복잡한 프롬프트 지식 없이도 누구나 전문가 수준의 결과물을 손쉽게 얻을 수 있습니다.\n ️ 바나나 캔버스 화면 구성 한눈에 보기 (입력-제어-결과)\n바나나 캔버스는 사용자가 직관적으로 작업 흐름을 따라갈 수 있도록 '입력, 제어, 결과'의 3단 구조로 화면이 설계되어 있어요. 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 자연스럽게 작업이 진행되어 처음 사용하는 분들도 어렵지 않을 겁니다.\n1. 왼쪽: 모든 작업의 시작점 '입력'\n모든 작업의 시작점. 텍스트로 새 이미지를 만들거나, PC 이미지를 불러와 '빠른 작업'을 실행할 수 있습니다.\n2. 중앙: 핵심 제어 영역 '편집 및 합성'\n이미지 편집과 합성의 핵심. 불러온 이미지의 스타일 변경이나 여러 이미지 합성 등 구체적인 지시를 내리는 곳입니다.\n3. 오른쪽: 최종 결과 확인 영역 '결과'\nAI가 생성한 최종 결과물 표시 영역. 로딩, 오류, 완성 이미지 확인 및 저장 공간입니다.\n ️ 바나나 캔버스의 주요 기능 상세 가이드\n이제 바나나 캔버스가 제공하는 주요 기능들을 좀 더 자세히 알아볼 시간이에요. 정말 다재다능한 툴이라는 걸 느끼실 겁니다.\n1. 텍스트로 새 이미지 만들기\n아이디어만으로 완전히 새로운 이미지를 만들어내는 기능. 아이디어 입력 → 카테고리 선택 → 종횡비 선택 → 이미지 생성 순으로 진행합니다. \"밤하늘을 나는 고래\"처럼 간단한 아이디어를 입력해도 AI가 전문적인 지시문으로 자동 변환해주니, 프롬프트 지식 없이도 전문가 수준의 결과물을 얻을 수 있어요.\n2. 이미지를 업로드하고 '빠른 작업' 활용하기\nPC 이미지를 불러와 모든 작업의 기준으로 삼는 기능. 업로드 후 '빠른 작업'으로 자주 사용하는 편집을 원클릭으로 실행할 수 있습니다.\n배경 제거: 피사체만 깔끔하게 제거, 투명 PNG 파일로 저장.\n부분 삭제: 지우고 싶은 부분을 칠하면 AI가 주변과 어울리게 채워줍니다.\n증명사진 변환: 인물 사진을 정장/흰색 배경으로 변환, 정면 사진이 아니어도 정면으로 변환까지!\n평면도를 3D로: 2D 건축 평면도를 가구가 배치된 사실적인 3D 아이소메트릭 뷰로 시각화.\n만화 패널 변환: 이미지를 만화 장면처럼 변환 (느와르, 웹툰, 코믹스 스타일 선택 가능). 텍스트 언어 지정 (한국어 렌더링은 아직 완벽하지 않음).\n3. 중앙 제어 영역의 고급 기능들\n더 강력하고 전문적인 기능들을 살펴볼 차례입니다.\n복원 기능: 오래된 사진 손상 채우기, 흑백 컬러화, 2~4배 업스케일.\n채색하기: 스케치/라인 아트에 색과 명암을 칠해 완성된 일러스트로.\n스타일 변환: 원본의 구도/내용 유지, 아트 스타일만 재창조 (예: 피규어, 애니메이션).\n이미지 합성: 여러 이미지를 놀랍도록 자연스럽게 합성 (예: 가족+바다, 모델+가방+선글라스+한복).\n인생 앨범 제작: 인물 사진 한 장으로 유아기부터 노년기까지의 모습이 담긴 콜라주 앨범 생성. 정말 특별한 기능이에요!\n바나나 캔버스 (BANANA CANVAS) 바로 사용하기\n  핵심 요약\n1. 나노바나나는 구글 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image의 별명으로, 캐릭터 일관성, 다중 이미지 합성, 정확한 텍스트 렌더링 등 혁신적 성능을 자랑합니다.\n2. 포토샵 등 기존 툴 대비 압도적인 작업 시간 단축, 낮은 기술적 난이도, 무한한 창의적 가능성을 제공합니다.\n3.

앤트로픽의 새로운 크롬 확장 프로그램이 우리의 웹 브라우징 경험을 어떻게 바꾸고, 어떤 잠재적 위험을 안고 있는지 심층적으로 분석합니다. 이 혁신적인 기능이 과연 그 값어치를 하는지 함께 고민해 보세요.</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">요즘 AI 기술 발전 속도가 정말 무섭다는 생각을 많이 하는데요, 여러분은 어떠세요? 특히 앤트로픽(Anthropic)의 클로드(Claude) AI가 최근 공개한 기능은 저를 깜짝 놀라게 했습니다. 바로 '브라우저 제어' 기능인데요. 아니, AI가 내 브라우저를 직접 조작한다고? 솔직히 처음 들었을 때 기대보다는 좀 묘한 불안감이 앞섰어요. 과연 이 기능이 우리에게 어떤 의미를 가지며, 또 월 20만원에 달하는(?) 구독료가 과연 합당한지, 오늘은 저와 함께 이 흥미로운 주제를 파헤쳐볼까 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">앤트로픽은 최근 클로드 AI의 크롬 확장 프로그램을 공개하며, 특정 사용자들을 대상으로 이 기능을 시험하고 있다고 발표했어요. 이 확장 프로그램은 클로드가 사용자의 브라우저 활동을 '볼 수' 있게 할 뿐만 아니라, 심지어는 사용자를 대신해 '작업을 수행할 수' 있도록 한다고 합니다. 마치 미래 영화에서 보던 일이 현실이 되는 것만 같은 느낌이죠. 그런데 말입니다, 이 미래가 정말 우리가 원하던 미래일까요?

확장 프로그램 내 챗봇 창을 통해 이런 상호작용이 가능하다고 합니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">브라우저 직접 제어: 미래인가, 과도한 개입인가?</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">앤트로픽의 비전은 여기서 멈추지 않습니다. 클로드는 단순히 맥락을 파악하는 것을 넘어, 직접 브라우저를 조작하여 사용자를 대신해 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 상상만 해도 대단하지 않나요? 몇 가지 예시를 통해 이 기능을 좀 더 구체적으로 살펴보겠습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>예시 1: 아파트 매물 찾기</b><br />여러분, 이사할 집을 찾아본 경험 있으시죠? 앤트로픽은 사용자가 Zillow(해외 부동산 웹사이트)에서 아파트를 찾을 때, 클로드에게 원하는 조건을 말하면 클로드가 직접 Zillow에 접속해 매물을 검색하고, 가장 적합한 목록을 찾아 공유해 줄 수 있다고 설명합니다. 심지어 어떤 페이지 콘텐츠를 읽어야 하는지 등 필요한 권한까지 사용자에게 알려준다고 해요.</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>예시 2: 음식 주문하기</b><br />저녁 메뉴를 고르다가 '마늘 면'이 갑자기 당기는 날이 있죠? 클로드에게 DoorDash(해외 배달 앱)에서 평점 좋은 마늘 면 식당을 찾아 장바구니에 담아달라고 요청할 수 있습니다. 클로드는 DoorDash 홈페이지를 인식하고, '마늘 면'을 검색창에 입력한 뒤 엔터 키를 누르는 일련의 과정을 직접 보여준다고 합니다. 이거, 거의 SF 영화의 한 장면 아닌가요?</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">음... 솔직히 말해서, 광고하는 대로 작동한다면 정말 엄청난 기능임은 분명합니다. 하지만 제가 직접 써보니, 아니 솔직히 말하면 아직 써보지 못했지만 상상해볼 때, 과연 모든 일에 AI의 도움을 받아야 할까 하는 의문이 들어요. 저는 새로운 아파트를 찾아보는 과정이나, 맛있는 저녁 식당을 고르는 과정에서 나름의 즐거움을 느끼거든요. 클로드가 어떤 기준으로 '나에게 맞는' 아파트를 고르고, 어떤 식당의 '마늘 면'이 가장 맛있을 거라고 판단할 수 있을까요? 이런 주관적인 선택들은 여전히 사람의 몫이라고 생각합니다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"클로드 AI가 웹 브라우저에서 검색 버튼을 누르고 텍스트를 입력하는 모습.

        "contentSnippet": "월 20만원이라는 거액을 들여 클로드 AI의 브라우저 제어 기능을 구독해야 할까요? 앤트로픽의 새로운 크롬 확장 프로그램이 우리의 웹 브라우징 경험을 어떻게 바꾸고, 어떤 잠재적 위험을 안고 있는지 심층적으로 분석합니다. 이 혁신적인 기능이 과연 그 값어치를 하는지 함께 고민해 보세요.\n요즘 AI 기술 발전 속도가 정말 무섭다는 생각을 많이 하는데요, 여러분은 어떠세요? 특히 앤트로픽(Anthropic)의 클로드(Claude) AI가 최근 공개한 기능은 저를 깜짝 놀라게 했습니다. 바로 '브라우저 제어' 기능인데요. 아니, AI가 내 브라우저를 직접 조작한다고? 솔직히 처음 들었을 때 기대보다는 좀 묘한 불안감이 앞섰어요. 과연 이 기능이 우리에게 어떤 의미를 가지며, 또 월 20만원에 달하는(?) 구독료가 과연 합당한지, 오늘은 저와 함께 이 흥미로운 주제를 파헤쳐볼까 합니다.\n앤트로픽은 최근 클로드 AI의 크롬 확장 프로그램을 공개하며, 특정 사용자들을 대상으로 이 기능을 시험하고 있다고 발표했어요. 이 확장 프로그램은 클로드가 사용자의 브라우저 활동을 '볼 수' 있게 할 뿐만 아니라, 심지어는 사용자를 대신해 '작업을 수행할 수' 있도록 한다고 합니다. 마치 미래 영화에서 보던 일이 현실이 되는 것만 같은 느낌이죠. 그런데 말입니다, 이 미래가 정말 우리가 원하던 미래일까요?  \n\n\n  클로드 AI의 브라우저 제어 기능, 무엇이 가능할까?\n클로드 AI의 브라우저 제어 기능은 크게 두 가지 측면에서 작동합니다. 하나는 '맥락 이해 능력'의 강화이고, 다른 하나는 '실제 브라우저 조작'입니다. 이 두 가지가 합쳐지면 상상 이상의 시너지를 낼 수 있다고 하는데요, 자세히 한번 들여다보죠.\n \n\n\n\n \n브라우저 내용 파악 및 응답 개선\n가장 기본적인 기능은 클로드가 사용자가 브라우저에서 무엇을 하고 있는지 실시간으로 파악하는 것입니다. 예를 들어, 제가 어떤 기사를 읽고 있다면 클로드는 그 내용을 이해하고 제가 던지는 질문에 훨씬 더 정확하고 맥락에 맞는 답변을 해줄 수 있게 되는 거죠. 마치 옆에서 제 활동을 지켜보며 언제든 조언해 줄 준비가 된 비서 같다고 할까요? 확장 프로그램 내 챗봇 창을 통해 이런 상호작용이 가능하다고 합니다.\n브라우저 직접 제어: 미래인가, 과도한 개입인가?\n앤트로픽의 비전은 여기서 멈추지 않습니다. 클로드는 단순히 맥락을 파악하는 것을 넘어, 직접 브라우저를 조작하여 사용자를 대신해 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 상상만 해도 대단하지 않나요? 몇 가지 예시를 통해 이 기능을 좀 더 구체적으로 살펴보겠습니다.\n  예시 1: 아파트 매물 찾기\n여러분, 이사할 집을 찾아본 경험 있으시죠? 앤트로픽은 사용자가 Zillow(해외 부동산 웹사이트)에서 아파트를 찾을 때, 클로드에게 원하는 조건을 말하면 클로드가 직접 Zillow에 접속해 매물을 검색하고, 가장 적합한 목록을 찾아 공유해 줄 수 있다고 설명합니다. 심지어 어떤 페이지 콘텐츠를 읽어야 하는지 등 필요한 권한까지 사용자에게 알려준다고 해요.\n  예시 2: 음식 주문하기\n저녁 메뉴를 고르다가 '마늘 면'이 갑자기 당기는 날이 있죠? 클로드에게 DoorDash(해외 배달 앱)에서 평점 좋은 마늘 면 식당을 찾아 장바구니에 담아달라고 요청할 수 있습니다. 클로드는 DoorDash 홈페이지를 인식하고, '마늘 면'을 검색창에 입력한 뒤 엔터 키를 누르는 일련의 과정을 직접 보여준다고 합니다. 이거, 거의 SF 영화의 한 장면 아닌가요?\n음... 솔직히 말해서, 광고하는 대로 작동한다면 정말 엄청난 기능임은 분명합니다. 하지만 제가 직접 써보니, 아니 솔직히 말하면 아직 써보지 못했지만 상상해볼 때, 과연 모든 일에 AI의 도움을 받아야 할까 하는 의문이 들어요. 저는 새로운 아파트를 찾아보는 과정이나, 맛있는 저녁 식당을 고르는 과정에서 나름의 즐거움을 느끼거든요. 클로드가 어떤 기준으로 '나에게 맞는' 아파트를 고르고, 어떤 식당의 '마늘 면'이 가장 맛있을 거라고 판단할 수 있을까요? 이런 주관적인 선택들은 여전히 사람의 몫이라고 생각합니다.\n\n\n⚠️ 편리함 뒤에 숨겨진 위험: 클로드 AI와 보안 문제\n아무리 편리하다고 해도, AI가 내 브라우저를 직접 제어한다는 것은 필연적으로 보안 문제와 연결될 수밖에 없습니다. 앤트로픽 역시 이 부분에 대해 투명하게 언급하고 있는데요, 중요한 것은 우리가 어떤 위험을 감수해야 하는지 정확히 알아야 한다는 점입니다.\n프롬프트 인젝션 공격의 위험성\n앤트로픽은 AI 브라우저가 '프롬프트 인젝션 공격'에 취약할 수 있다고 인정했습니다. 이는 악의적인 행위자가 AI 모델에 악성 지시를 삽입하여 오작동을 유도하는 사이버 공격의 일종입니다. 테스트 결과, 안전장치를 구현하기 전에는 이런 공격의 성공률이 무려 23.6%에 달했다고 해요.\n⚠️ 끔찍한 예시: 메일함 삭제 공격\n실제로 앤트로픽의 한 테스트에서, 클로드 AI는 악성 지시가 담긴 이메일을 읽고는 사용자의 메일함에 있는 모든 이메일을 삭제하는 명령을 그대로 수행했다고 합니다. 상상만 해도 아찔하죠? 소중한 메일들이 한순간에 사라진다면... 정말 생각하기도 싫습니다.\n앤트로픽의 안전장치와 현재의 한계\n다행히 앤트로픽은 이러한 보안 우려를 해소하기 위해 여러 안전장치를 마련하고 있다고 밝혔습니다. 사용자에게 사이트별 권한을 제어할 수 있는 기능을 제공하고, 콘텐츠 게시, 구매, 개인 정보 공유와 같은 '고위험' 작업 전에 반드시 사용자에게 확인을 거치도록 한다고 해요. 또한, 클로드의 개인 데이터 처리 방식에 대한 지침을 개선하고, 금융 거래나 성인/불법 콘텐츠 관련 사이트 등 '고위험 사이트'에 대해서는 아예 접근을 차단했다고 합니다. 이런 노력들은 분명 긍정적입니다. 하지만... 그럼에도 불구하고 아직은 초기 단계라 조심스러울 수밖에 없다는 게 제 생각입니다. 계속해서 안전장치를 보강 중이며, 그래서 현재는 테스트 규모도 매우 제한적이라고 하네요.\n\n\n  월 20만원? 클로드 AI 브라우저 제어 기능, 어떻게 사용할 수 있나?\n자, 그럼 이 혁신적이면서도 논란의 여지가 있는 기능을 어떻게 하면 사용할 수 있을까요? 현재로서는 접근이 상당히 제한적입니다. 앤트로픽은 초기 테스트를 오직 1,000명의 클로드 맥스(Claude Max) 구독자에게만 제공하고 있습니다. 여기서 중요한 건 '맥스' 구독료인데요, 월 100달러 또는 200달러에 달하는, 우리 돈으로 치면 대략 월 13만원에서 26만원(환율에 따라 변동) 정도의 어마어마한 금액입니다.  \n앤트로픽은 향후 몇 주에 걸쳐 더 많은 맥스 구독자에게 초기 접근 권한을 확대할 예정이라고 합니다. 제 생각에는 언젠가는 프로 구독자(월 20달러)에게도 테스트 기회가 주어지지 않을까 조심스럽게 예측해봅니다만, 현재로서는 '그들만의 리그'라고 볼 수 있겠습니다. 지금 당장이라도 기다림 명단에 등록할 수는 있지만, 앞서 언급된 위험을 감수해야 한다는 경고 문구를 간과해서는 안 됩니다. 즉, 악의적인 사용자들로부터 다음과 같은 위험에 노출될 수 있다는 거죠.\n여러분의 계정이나 파일에 접근\n개인 정보 공유\n여러분을 대신한 구매 진행\n의도하지 않은 행동 수행\n음, 단순히 편리함을 얻기 위해 감수하기에는 위험 부담이 너무 크지 않나 하는 생각이 강하게 듭니다. 특히나 월 20만원 이상의 비용을 지불해야 한다는 점을 고려하면 말이죠.\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n브라우저 제어 기능: 클로드 AI가 사용자의 브라우저 활동을 파악하고, 직접 웹사이트를 조작하여 작업을 대신 수행합니다.\n잠재적 편리성: 아파트 검색, 음식 주문 등 반복적이거나 시간 소모적인 작업을 AI가 대신 처리해줄 수 있습니다.\n심각한 보안 우려: 프롬프트 인젝션 공격에 취약하며, 초기 테스트에서 악성 지시에 따라 이메일을 삭제한 사례가 보고되었습니다.\n높은 구독료와 제한된 접근: 현재 월 100~200달러의 클로드 맥스 구독자에게만 제공되며, 여전히 여러 위험을 안고 있습니다.\n이 기능은 미래 기술의 한 단면을 보여주지만, 개인 정보 보호와 보안에 대한 신중한 고려가 필요합니다. 과연 그 값어치를 할지는 사용자의 판단에 달려 있습니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 클로드 AI 브라우저 제어 기능의 구독료는 얼마인가요?\n현재 이 기능은 앤트로픽의 최상위 플랜인 클로드 맥스(Claude Max) 구독자에게만 제공되며, 월 100달러 또는 200달러(한화 약 13만원~26만원, 환율에 따라 변동)입니다. 상당히 높은 가격대입니다.\nQ2: 브라우저 제어 기능은 어떤 작업을 대신 해줄 수 있나요?\n웹사이트 탐색, 특정 정보 검색, 온라인 양식 작성, 아파트 매물 찾기, 음식 주문하기 등 사용자를 대신하여 브라우저에서 다양한 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 맥락을 이해하고 적절한 조치를 취하는 것이 가능하다고 합니다.\nQ3: 클로드 AI 브라우저 제어 기능 사용 시 보안 위험은 없나요?\n앤트로픽은 '프롬프트 인젝션 공격'과 같은 잠재적 보안 위험이 있음을 인정하고 있습니다. 현재 안전장치를 마련하고 있지만, 사용자의 계정 접근, 개인 정보 공유, 무단 구매 등 악의적인 행위에 노출될 위험이 여전히 존재할 수 있습니다. 아직 초기 테스트 단계라 주의가 필요합니다.\nQ4: 일반 사용자도 이 기능을 곧 사용할 수 있을까요?\n현재는 극히 제한된 클로드 맥스 구독자에게만 초기 접근이 허용되고 있습니다. 앤트로픽은 점진적으로 더 많은 맥스 구독자에게 확대한 뒤, 향후에는 프로 구독자에게도 기회가 주어질 가능성이 있다고 예측해 볼 수 있습니다. 하지만 일반 사용자가 바로 접근하기까지는 상당한 시간이 걸릴 것으로 예상됩니다.\n월 20만원이라는 높은 비용을 감수하면서 클로드 AI의 브라우저 제어 기능을 구독할 가치가 있을까요? 편리함의 극대화를 추구하는 사람들에게는 매력적인 제안일 수 있습니다. 하지만 제 개인적인 생각으로는, 아직은 보안 문제와 주관적인 판단의 영역에서 넘어야 할 산이 많아 보입니다. 당장은 제가 직접 브라우징하고 선택하는 즐거움을 포기할 만큼의 매력은 못 느끼는 게 솔직한 심정입니다.\n물론, 앞으로 기술이 발전하고 안전장치가 더욱 견고해진다면 이야기는 달라질 수 있겠죠. 여러분은 이 혁신적인 기능에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나요?

저희는 ‘정복’이 아니라 ‘개척’을 선택했습니다. 이미 거대한 플랫폼이 버티고 있는 시장에서 똑같이 싸우는 건 답이 아니었죠. 대신 우리가 열 수 있는 새로운 항로, 새로운 사용자 경험을 찾아 나섰습니다.\n우선 UX를 전면 개편해 단순한 ‘딜 나열’이 아니라 ‘피드 기반 탐색’으로 전환했고, 광고 모델도 성과 중심의 CPC 구조로 바꿨습니다. 모든 지면을 카탈로그화하고 결제 퍼널을 간소화했지만, 거래액 감소와 추천 시스템 한계라는 벽도 마주했습니다. 그럼에도 우리가 만들고 싶었던 건 단 하나였습니다. 사용자가 수많은 상품 속에서 ‘운명의 상품’을 만나는 경험이었죠.\n이어지는 항해는 노출량을 늘려 전환율을 보완하는 전략이었습니다. 이 과정에서 ‘Traffic = Revenue’라는 공식을 직접 검증하며 체력을 붙였고, 동시에 추천 시스템도 근본부터 다시 만들고 있습니다.\n물론 넘어야 할 난관은 여전히 많습니다. “토스답지 않은 디자인”, “왜 토스에서 쇼핑을 하냐”는 피드백도 직접 들었습니다. 하지만 변명 대신 개선을 택했습니다. 배송은 재무적으로 지속 가능한 구조를 만들고, 가품과 저품질은 셀러 정책으로 걸러내며, 가격 경쟁력은 데이터 기반으로 확보해 가고 있습니다. 현재는 수만 명의 셀러와 함께 상품을 쌓아가고 있습니다. 지난 학기에 얻은 러닝은 분명합니다. 커머스는 정복이 아니라 개척이라는 것. 앞으로도 정해진 길을 따르기보다, 유저의 즐거운 경험을 위해 해적정신을 발휘하겠습니다.”\n\nwow, who made this?\n— 토스인컴 Toss Income Product team 윤주승, 한다솜\n\n“이번 학기 토스인컴의 핵심 동력은 ‘환급 엔진’이었습니다. 국내 어떤 서비스보다 정확한 엔진을 갖추고 있었기에 때로는 경쟁사보다 적은 환급액을 보여주기도 했지만, 저희는 신뢰를 더 중요하게 생각했습니다.\n세금 환급 과정에서도 끊임없이 새로운 제품 타입을 시도했습니다. 리워드형, 참여형, 시즌형 등 다양한 실험을 거쳤고, UX 라이팅·ML·디자인 챕터와 협업해 다양한 메시지를 만들었습니다. 전환율을 높이기 위한 과감한 실험도 병행했고, 그 과정에서 사용자의 ‘현재 편향성’을 직접 검증할 수 있었죠. 이런 시도가 쌓여 결국 ‘선정산/후결제’ 같은 파격적인 기능이 탄생했습니다.\n이번 학기 경험을 통해 확인한 핵심은 단순합니다. 과감한 실험과 정확한 엔진이 만나야 사용자 신뢰와 성장을 동시에 잡을 수 있다는 것. 앞으로도 저희 팀은 과감하면서도 정확하게 나아가겠습니다.”\n\n수신제가치국평천하\n— 토스플레이스 POS Home 1 Team, POS Home 2 Team 김민주, 김태형\n\n“저희 팀이 올해 붙잡은 화두는 ‘수신제가치국평천하’였습니다. 스스로를 단단히 세우고 집안을 정리해야 나라를 다스릴 수 있듯, POS 홈팀이 바로 서야 토스포스 전체가 성장할 수 있다고 믿었거든요.\n사장님들 눈에는 토스 포스가 여전히 부족해 보였습니다. 저희는 그 생생한 불편함에 귀 기울이며 하나씩 개선했습니다. 영수증·주문서 개선, KDS 런칭, 후불 결제 보완 등 운영에 필요한 기능을 촘촘히 채우며 핵심 기능들을 보완했죠. 설치 과정도 자동 테이블 생성, 자유로운 편집, 복제 버튼으로 훨씬 간단해졌습니다. 덕분에 이제는 대리점과 사장님들 모두 “토스 포스 덕분에 일이 편해졌다”는 피드백을 주고 계십니다.\n여기에 ‘나중에 적립’ 기능으로 POS 고객을 토스 회원과 연결하기 시작했습니다. 현재는 수천 개 매장에서 가능하며, 사장님들의 높은 동의율을 이끌어 내고 있죠. \n이 과정을 통해 배운 점은 명확합니다. 제품이 고객의 일상에 깊숙이 들어가려면 사소한 불편부터 차근차근 해결해야 한다는 것. 작은 개선이 쌓여야 비로소 플랫폼의 힘이 생긴다는 사실이었습니다.”\n\n인증왕이 될 거야\n— 토스뱅크 Auth Team 강동훈\n\n“저희 팀의 목표는 단순했습니다. 인증에서 고객이 겪는 불편을 없애고, 더 쉽고 안전한 경험을 제공하는 것. 하지만 현실은 녹록지 않았습니다. 인증 성공률은 기대에 못 미쳤고, 영상통화 인증은 비용도 크고 시간이 오래 걸렸습니다.\n그래서 기존 방식을 깨보기로 했습니다. “왜 인증을 따로따로 거쳐야 하지?”라는 질문에서 출발해, 두 가지 인증을 한 번에 처리하는 새로운 방식을 설계했습니다. 토스인증서와 셀피 인증을 묶거나, 휴대폰과 생체 인증을 결합하는 식이었죠. \n덕분에 영상통화 인증은 몇 분 걸리던 과정을 단 30초로 줄였고, 신분증 거래 제한도 간단한 인증으로 대체해 수일 걸리던 절차를 즉시 해결할 수 있었습니다. 인증 수단은 점점 늘어났고, 성공률은 높아졌으며, 비용과 민원은 크게 줄어들었습니다.\n저희가 확인한 진실은 분명합니다. 인증은 ‘어쩔 수 없이 거치는 절차’가 아니라, 곧 사용자 경험 자체라는 것. 그리고 허들을 낮추고 불필요한 단계를 없애야만 성공률·비용·만족도를 동시에 잡을 수 있다는 것!”\n\n묻지도 따지지도 않는 안심정산플랜\n— 토스페이먼츠 Merchant Enabling Tribe 최희정, 김수영\n\n“온라인 가맹점이 PG를 이용할 때 가장 먼저 마주하는 벽은 ‘보증보험’입니다. 매년 반복되는 번거로운 갱신, 산더미 같은 서류, 스타트업에 불리한 심사와 높은 보험료까지. 사업자에게는 큰 부담이었습니다.\n저희는 스스로에게 물었습니다. “꼭 보험이어야 할까?” 데이터를 하나하나 뜯어보고, 수차례 실패를 반복하며 정책 설계의 근거를 다듬었습니다. 그렇게 탄생한 것이 ‘안심정산플랜’입니다. RMS(리스크 관리 시스템)와 취소 한도를 기반으로 리스크를 줄이고, 불필요한 절차 대신 멤버십 구조로 정산 혜택을 제공하는 방식이었습니다.\n반응은 뜨거웠습니다. 단순히 설문만 보여줬을 뿐인데도 대부분의 사업자가 쓰겠다고 답했습니다. 기존의 관행을 전환하는 것만으로도 의미 있는 효과가 확인됐습니다.\n금융에서 당연하게 여겨지던 관행도 데이터와 기술을 근거로 새롭게 설계할 수 있다는 것을 깨달았죠. 앞으로도 사업자의 부담을 덜고, 더 나은 경험을 만들 수 있는 방법을 계속 찾아 나가겠습니다.”\n\n\"아직도 할 게 있어요?”\n— 토스증권 Community Silo 김유경, 최보금\n\n“지난 2년간 토스증권 커뮤니티는 빠른 속도로 성장했습니다. 성장의 원동력은 좋은 글을 중심으로 한 ‘플라이휠’ 구조였습니다. 투자 고수들의 글이 팔로우와 재방문을 만들고, 다시 좋은 글을 낳는 선순환이 굴러가기 시작한 거죠.\n하지만 확장은 쉽지 않았습니다. 종목 토론을 넘어 관심사별로 소통할 수 있는 ‘주제별 커뮤니티’를 출시했지만 참여는 저조했습니다. 대신 우리가 발견한 건 의외의 영역이었습니다. 투자와 일상을 섞은 글, 모두가 관심을 가지는 시사 이슈, 가볍게 웃을 수 있는 아무말 대잔치. 이런 콘텐츠에서 사용자들의 활발한 반응이 일어났습니다.\n커뮤니티의 방향은 유저가 쓰는 글이 만든다는 것. 커뮤니티가 건강하게 자라려면 우리가 원하는 콘텐츠가 아니라, 유저가 쓰고 싶은 글을 중심에 두어야 한다는 걸 알게 되었죠.\n이 배움을 바탕으로 약관을 개정해 UGC(사용자 생성 콘텐츠)를 외부로 확산할 수 있게 했고, 광고·파트너십을 통한 배포 전략도 준비했습니다. 다음 학기의 목표는 이제 더 명확합니다. 유저가 쓴 좋은 글로 신규 유저를 불러오고, 팔로우로 재방문을 늘리며, 이를 다시 콘텐츠 투자로 연결하는 ‘그로스 루프’를 완성하는 것. 그리고 주식 커뮤니티 분야에서 세계 1위를 향해 나아가는 것입니다.”\n앞으로의 항해\n\n언제나 그랬듯 이번 학기에도 토스에는 수많은 도전이 있었습니다. 때로는 거친 파도를 맞고, 예상치 못한 암초에 부딪히기도 했지만, 그 과정에서 더 단단해질 수 있었어요. 가장 중요한 건 멈추지 않고 계속 유난하게 항해했다는 점이겠죠.\n해적정신이 테마였던 이번 얼라인먼트 기간 내내 <원피스(ONE PIECE)>의 밀짚모자 해적단을 떠올렸어요. 주인공 루피와 동료들은 강한 적을 만나 고전하면서도 결국 똘똘 뭉쳐 이겨내고, 위대한 항로를 나아갑니다. 어느덧 10년이 넘는 항해를 하고 있지만, 여전히 처음처럼 서로를 믿고 의지하며 강해지고 있는 토스 해적단. 앞으로도 우리는 더 큰 바다를 향해 나아갈 것입니다. 원피스를 찾는 그날까지요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",

MAGA는 사라지지 않을 구호다⟩\n토스증권 리서치센터 애널리스트들은 최근 미국 정치의 심장 워싱턴 D.C.를 다녀왔습니다. 트럼프 당선 이후 정치가 글로벌 주식시장을 흔드는 지금, 현장에서 투자 아이디어를 찾기 위해서였죠.\n그곳에서 얻은 첫 번째 인사이트는 분명했습니다. 트럼프가 퇴임하더라도, MAGA(Make America Great Again)로 상징되는 미국 우선주의는 쉽게 사라지지 않을 것이라는 사실이었어요.\n\n워싱턴 D.C. 출장 기간 동안 백악관, 국회의사당, 허드슨 연구소 같은 싱크탱크까지 두루 돌아보고 왔습니다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}이 과정에서 특히 인상적이었던 건 곳곳에서 발견한 ‘미국 우선주의’의 흔적이었습니다. 실제로 백악관 근처 노점에는 America First나 MAGA(Make America Great Again) 문구가 새겨진 모자와 티셔츠를 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있었죠.\n이 문구들은 트럼프 대통령을 상징하는 슬로건인데요. 트럼프 정부 출범 직후 높은 관세, 제조업 부흥 등 미국의 이익을 최우선에 두는 정책들이 시행됐고, 이는 상반기 주식시장을 크게 흔든 요인이 되었습니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}백악관 주변 노점상에서 판매 중인 MAGA 기념품 / 사진: 로이터\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\nMAGA는\n트럼프가 만든 구호가 아니다\n‘MAGA’와 ‘America First’ 같은 구호는 트럼프의 전유물처럼 보이지만, 사실 그가 처음 만든 말은 아닙니다.\n워싱턴 D.C.에 있는 국회의사당 돔 천장과 벽화에는 독립선언, 서부 개척, 남북전쟁 장면이 새겨져 있었고, 국립문서관과 의사당 도서관에는 미국 정치사의 중요한 순간들이 보존되어 있습니다. 기록들을 읽어보니, 건국 초기부터 미국은 ‘자국 우선주의’라는 메시지를 일관되게 반복해 왔다는 점을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\n초대 대통령 조지 워싱턴은 고별사에서 “외국과의 영속적 동맹을 경계하라”고 말했습니다. 제임스 먼로 대통령이 공표한 ‘먼로 독트린’에는 “외국의 체제 확장 시도는 우리의 평화와 안전에 위협이 된다”는 문장이 담겨 있었습니다. 자국 우선주의를 외교 정책의 핵심 원칙으로 못 박은 것이죠.\n\n미국의 주요 역사, 정치 서적 등이 있는 국회의사당 도서관 / 사진: 토스증권\n이후 ‘America First’는 시대마다 되살아났습니다. 1930~40년대 대공황 시기에는 은행 파산과 중산층 붕괴 속에서 미국우선위원회(America First Committee, AFC)가 결성돼 전국적 운동을 벌였고, 정부의 2차 세계대전 유럽 지원을 막아내기도 했습니다. 진주만 공습으로 미국이 전쟁에 참여하면서 미국우선위원회는 해체되었지만, 반공주의나 이민 제한, 방위비 감축 등의 정책 기조로 이어졌습니다.\n1970년대 후반, 베트남전에서 사실상 패배하고, 경기 침체까지 이어지며 자신감을 잃은 미국은 또 한 번 위기를 맞았습니다. 이때 로널드 레이건 대통령이 내세운 슬로건이 바로 ‘MAGA’였습니다.\n트럼프의 MAGA는 새로 등장한 구호가 아니라, 위기 때마다 반복돼 온 ‘미국 우선주의’ 전통의 최신 버전이라 할 수 있습니다.\n\n미국우선위원회 로고와 레이건 MAGA 캠페인 로고\n바이든도 사실은\n자국 우선주의였다\n민주당 출신으로 국제 협력과 동맹 복원을 강조해 온 바이든 정부조차, 실제로는 미국 우선주의에 기반한 정책을 펼쳤습니다. 핵심은 보조금과 투자 인센티브를 통해 글로벌 기업들을 미국으로 끌어들인 것이었습니다.\n특히 제조업 기반을 회복하고, 중국을 견제하려는 의도가 뚜렷했습니다. 중국이 희토류와 반도체 같은 핵심 자원을 무역 무기로 활용할 가능성이 커지면서, IRA*와 CHIPS법**으로 새로운 무역 장벽을 세운 것이죠.\n.css-1ebvaan{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 인플레이션 감축법: 보조금 지급 조건으로 미국산 부품 사용과 현지 생산을 의무화, 해외 기업의 미국 투자 유도\n** 반도체 지원법: 중국 내 첨단 반도체 투자를 제한하며, 미국과 동맹국 중심의 공급망을 구축\n이 때문에 워싱턴 현지에서는 바이든 정부의 기조를 ‘바이든 버전의 MAGA’라고 부르기도 했습니다. 겉으로는 동맹과 협력을 내세웠지만, 실제 정책은 미국 산업과 기술 주권 강화를 지향했고, 트럼프 정부의 노선과 본질적으로 크게 다르지 않았기 때문입니다.\n\nMAGA는 앞으로도\n계속될 것이다\n트럼프의 MAGA는 새롭게 등장한 구호가 아니라, 오래전부터 이어져 온 ‘미국 우선주의’의 현대적 반복입니다. 그리고 이 흐름은 앞으로도 쉽게 사라지지 않을 가능성이 큽니다.\n지금도 미국은 위기 속에 있습니다. 중국의 추격, 기업들의 해외 이전, 줄어드는 제조업 일자리, 높아진 물가, 불안정한 공급망, 격화되는 기술 패권 경쟁. 이러한 환경은 다시금 자국 우선주의 전략을 강화하는 배경이 되고 있죠.\n미국 우선주의는 미국 정치사의 오랜 전통인 만큼 앞으로도 지속될 가능성이 큽니다. 강도가 잠시 완화될 수는 있어도, 언제든 다시 강화될 수 있죠.\n따라서 투자자라면 중장기 전략을 세울 때 반드시 이 흐름을 고려해야 합니다. 미국 우선주의는 글로벌 산업 전반을 흔들고, 결국 주식시장에도 직접적인 영향을 미치기 때문입니다.\n이어지는 다음 글에서는 미국 우선주의가 주요 산업에 어떤 영향을 미칠지, 투자자들이 취할 전략은 무엇일지 구체적으로 짚어드리겠습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 기명균 이준혁 윤동해 Writer 이영곤 애널리스트",
