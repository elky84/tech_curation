        "content:encodedSnippet": "vcpkg is a free and open-source C/C++ package manager maintained by Microsoft and the C++ community that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Over the years we have heard from companies using vcpkg to manage dependencies at enterprise-scale. In this interview, I spoke to Dimitri Rochette, a lead developer at Askia, an Ipsos company, about vcpkg’s impact on their team.\n\nAfter switching to vcpkg and CMake, Askia was able to reduce build times for their dependencies by using the vcpkg binary caching feature and reduce their code size by about 300,000 lines by eliminating project files, scripts, and copied dependencies. Switching to vcpkg also allowed them to ensure consistent and reproducible builds across multiple platforms, access a vast array of libraries, streamline their onboarding process as their development team grew, and standardize the use of microservices in a multi-repository environment.\nQ: Can you tell us about your company and team?\nAskia, a software company with two decades of experience, specializes in the development of tools for survey creation, response collection, and data analysis. In 2020, Ipsos, a global leader in market research, acquired Askia with the aim of collaboratively developing a platform that aligns with their ambitious goals. At the time of acquisition, Askia was a team of 30. However, with substantial investment from Ipsos, the team expanded rapidly to 90 members within just two years.\nQ: Can you tell us about your C++ development environment?\nAll our teams utilize the latest Visual Studio 2022. For C++ development, we employ two compilers: MSVC and GCC13. Our projects are all built with CMake and vcpkg. We’ve also implemented additional setup scripts in PowerShell 7 (PWSH) to ensure portability between Windows and Linux. These scripts handle the setup of developer and CI machines, GitHub tokens, NuGet caching, the initial cloning of vcpkg, and database creation for clusters or unit tests. We’re quite satisfied with CMake, despite the initial setup being challenging. The integration with Visual Studio continues to improve, and maintaining a single project for two platforms has been a significant advantage.\nWithin our project scope, the majority of our code is written in C++. We initially started with C++17 and have now transitioned to C++23. We strive to stay updated with the latest stable compilers for MSVC and GCC. Occasionally, we face challenges waiting for implementations to be available on both compilers. C++ code is on our critical path, and we aim to minimize latency as much as possible. We also have numerous services in C#.Net8, which is the most commonly used language company wise. We have a significant amount of T-SQL code as we heavily rely on SQL Server for our C++ services. For the frontend, we took a chance on Svelte before its 1.0 release, and we are extremely satisfied with the outcome today.\nOur development environment is based on Windows, while our production target is Ubuntu 22.04, housed within Docker containers. Despite this, all our code is compatible with Windows and is compiled using MSVC. This allows us to exchange services between both platforms.\nOur Docker container is structured in four layers, all built on Ubuntu 22.04:\nBase Image: This includes additional apt repositories, security measures, and an ODBC driver.\n\nDev: This layer is equipped with all the necessary tools for developers. It’s used as a workspace by developers and by the continuous integration (CI) system to execute unit tests.\n\nStatic Analysis: This layer is used by the CI system for static analysis and includes SonarCloud and its prerequisites.\nProduction: This is the image that runs the release version. It’s used by the CI system to install binaries of the Dev build on a clean image and is then uploaded for Kubernetes consumption.\nWe utilize the same images for both developers and CI, leveraging vcpkg binary caching (with GitHub serving as a NuGet server). This means that each build by a developer or CI either downloads or builds and uploads the result to the shared cache. We have 274 packages, with the main ones being downloaded 300 times per month. The ability to save even a single compilation of packages like OpenSSL or Python is greatly appreciated by the team and reduces our CI build times and costs.\nOur current codebase is relatively compact, comprising approximately 40,000 lines of C++ code, which are divided across various repositories for services and components. Our legacy codebase is significantly larger, containing more than 2 million lines of C++ code. The introduction of CMake and vcpkg to our main repository resulted in a reduction of about 10% (or 300,000 lines), which included project files, scripts, and copied dependencies.\nWe utilize GitHub as our continuous integration system. Given that we have scripts to configure developer tools and machines, as well as standard Docker images, we leverage these in our CI environment. The same image used by developers for their work is also used in GitHub CI. Additionally, on GitHub, we employ the other layers of our Docker container for building our release version and executing unit tests.\nQ: What kinds of C++ libraries do you consume?\nFor first-party private/internal libraries, we have established a vcpkg registry with our shared library. Those packages are allowed to use any other library provided by vcpkg. This includes a wrapper for asynchronous messaging (librabbitmq), a wrapper for logging (spdlog), a configuration file with an override system (nlohmann-json), our HTTP server (boost-beast), plugins for our HTTP server (boost asio, curl, fmt), a JWT token checker (jwt-cpp, cppcodec, OpenSSL), and Python scripts (boost-python, python3). The most crucial package for us is our CMake scripts, which define all output folders, all parameters per platform (compiler, C++ version, debug/release, Windows SDK, UNICODE, _UNICODE, NOMINMAX, etc.), our CMake function for tagging versions with git hash and version files, branch name, scripts to create zip or NuGet as output of build, and scripts to copy dependency DLLs.\nAs for open-source dependencies, we directly utilize boost, fmt, gtest, magic-enum, nanodbc, nlohmann-json, spdlog, pybind11, librabbitmq, openssl, and libcurl.\nWe also have a significant amount of MFC and some third-party controls in our legacy codebase. In our new codebase, LaunchDarkly is used by C# projects, so it may be used in C++ in the future.\nQ: How were you managing C++ dependencies before vcpkg?\nIn our legacy stack, which is based on the Windows GUI in MFC, we had a variety of methods for managing dependencies. These included:\nIncluding them as source\nIncluding them as source with modifications\nUsing public NuGet packages with MSBuild projects\nIncluding them as pre-compiled binaries\nThe system was functional, but it was challenging to keep track of what was used and in which version. The ABI break before 2015 served as a useful reminder to consider upgrading our NuGet packages. Our initial inventory of repository candidates for the CMake/vcpkg migration took some time, but all the standard ones were relatively easy to identify.\nQ: When did your team move to vcpkg and why did you ultimately choose it?\nI had previously used vcpkg at another company to develop a Windows/Linux Qt tool. The use of CMake/vcpkg was a lifesaver, eliminating the need to manage both Visual Studio and Xcode projects. When I joined the company in 2019, I found the build process to be quite cumbersome. We were heavily reliant on Jenkins, with numerous scripts and file copies pre/post-build. Many projects required relative builds of other projects. My first proof of concept was converting some projects to CMake, which involved converting NuGet dependencies to vcpkg. The integration of cmakeconfig.json into Visual Studio 2019 facilitated user acceptance. We maintained both sln + CMake in the repository for about a year in case we encountered any issues.\nThe acquisition by Ipsos brought significant changes. The need for scalability necessitated major modifications. We had to develop new microservices, and as the team became more familiar with the advantages of CMake/vcpkg, we made vcpkg mandatory for all new projects. The primary goal at this stage was to expedite the onboarding of new developers. We aimed to minimize the steps required to launch and debug a unit test as much as possible. We have iteratively improved this process, and today, the steps take less than half a day.\nThe steps include:\nInstalling Visual Studio with C++\nInstalling ODBCDriver\nCloning vcpkg\nCreating a GitHub token for binary caching\nWith these steps, all our C++ projects could be cloned, compiled, and debugged in unit tests. If you install Docker and create the reference image, you can target both Windows and Linux.\nSo, yes, vcpkg has been instrumental in our onboarding process. We have tripled the team size in a few years. Standardizing the tools helps developers working on one repository to easily transition to another.\nQ: What is your overall impression of vcpkg?\nvcpkg has been a game-changer in my 25 years of working with C++. It has revolutionized the way we manage dependencies by ensuring consistent and reproducible builds across multiple platforms. With a vast array of libraries at our disposal, we have the flexibility to create or extend libraries as needed. The caching feature significantly speeds up our build process. Moreover, vcpkg has streamlined our onboarding process and standardized the use of microservices in a multi-repository environment.\nLearn More About vcpkg\nIf you want to learn more about vcpkg, check out our website at vcpkg.io and read the vcpkg overview in our documentation.\nIf you have a story you would like to share with us about your experiences with vcpkg, feel free to contact us at vcpkg@microsoft.com.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2024.08.23 release, 2024-08-01 tool release, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout August. This month’s release includes several notable changes as well as bug fixes and documentation improvements. The most notable changes were:\nThe shell function used to run vcpkg artifacts commands has been renamed to vcpkg-shell. Artifacts users will need to update their commands to use this new identifier.\nA triplet variable called VCPKG_POST_PORTFILE_INCLUDES was added to allow users to specify a list of CMake files to include after the execution of portfile.cmake.\nDocumentation articles were added for using vcpkg to target Windows with MSVC as well as Universal Windows Platform (UWP).\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,475 total ports available in the vcpkg public registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n20 new ports were added to the open-source registry.\n267 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n30 people contributed to this release.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,300 forks and 22,700 stars on GitHub.\nLastly, it’s CppCon season, and I am giving a talk on 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them on Tuesday, September 17, 2024, from 16:45-17:45 MDT. If you are coming to the conference, check it out! If you are unable to make it, the talk should go up on YouTube sometime after the event.\nvcpkg changelog (2024.08.23 release)\nThe following notable changes were made in this release:\nThe shell function used to run vcpkg artifacts commands has been renamed from vcpkg to vcpkg-shell. This addresses some issues when running vcpkg from a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt. If you are an artifacts user, you will need to update your commands. For example: vcpkg activate should be changed to vcpkg-shell activate. Note: most vcpkg commands do not use the shell script, and you should still be able to run them as before (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1442).\nAdded VCPKG_POST_PORTFILE_INCLUDES triplet variable. Allows users to optionally specify a list of CMake files to include after the execution of portfile.cmake (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1417, thanks @Neumann-A!).\nBug fixes:\n\nFixed a crash if \"platform\": \"mips64\" is used (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1454, thanks @autoantwort!).\nAdded error checking for http binary caching when some incorrect URL formats are specified (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1459, thanks @autoantwort!).\nFixed several typos in console output (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1461).\nFixed JSON configuration schemas for vcpkg manifest files not correctly supporting ports with wildcards (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1429).\nFixed filesystem registry schema not including a \"baseline\" property (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1463).\nDocumentation changes\nUpdated the vcpkg Maintainer Guide to elaborate on port naming guidelines and add a guideline about downloading patch files (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#371).\nAdded vcpkg_msbuild_install maintainer function to Table of Contents (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#378, thanks @HNegus!).\nAdded articles for using vcpkg to target Windows with MSVC and Universal Windows Platform (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#77, thanks @walbourn!).\nDocumented triplet naming requirements and usage of VCPKG_CXX_FLAGS, along with some additional typo fixes and clarifications (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#384, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nFormatting improvements to several deprecation warnings in documentation (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#380, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nOther typo, formatting, and bug fixes (thanks @Thomas1664, @HNegus!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,337\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,239\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,214\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,249\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,929\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,293\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,263\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,306\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,185\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,105\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,608\n\n\nx64-android\n1,683\n\n\narm64-android\n1,657\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "PyCharm is one of the most well-known data science tools, offering excellent out-of-the-box support for Python, SQL, and other languages. PyCharm also provides integrations for Databricks, Hugging Face and many other important tools. All these features allow you to write good code and work with your data and projects faster. \nPyCharm Professional’s support for Jupyter notebooks combines the interactive nature of Jupyter notebooks with PyCharm’s superior code quality and data-related features. This blog post will explore how PyCharm’s Jupyter support can significantly boost your productivity.\n\n\n\n\nWatch this video to get a comprehensive overview of using Jupyter notebooks in PyCharm and learn how you can speed up your data workflows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed up data analysis\nGet acquainted with your data\nWhen you start working on your project, it is extremely important to understand what data you have, including information about the size of your dataset, any problems with it, and its  patterns. For this purpose, your pandas and Polars DataFrames can be rendered in Jupyter outputs in Excel-like tables. The tables are fully interactive, so you can easily sort one or multiple columns and browse and view your data, you can choose how many rows will be shown in a table and perform many other operations.\n\n\n\n\nThe table also provides some important information for example:\nYou can find the the size of a table in its header. \n\n\n\n\n\n You can find the data type symbols in the column headers.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also use JetBrains AI Assistant to get information about your DataFrame by clicking on the  icon.\n\n\n\n\nEasily spot issues with the data\nAfter getting acquainted with your data, you need to clean it. This an important step, but it is also extremely time consuming because there are all sorts of problems you could find, including missing values, outliers, inconsistencies in data types, and so on. Indeed, according to the State of Developer Ecosystem 2023 report, nearly 50% of Data Professionals dedicate 30% of their time or more to data preparation. Fortunately, PyCharm offers a variety of features that streamline the data-cleaning process.\nSome insights are already available in the column headers. \nFirst, we can easily spot the amount of missing data for each column because it is highlighted in red. Also, we may be able to see at a glance whether some of our columns have outliers. For example, in the bath column, the maximum value is significantly higher than the ninety-fifth percentile. Therefore, we can expect that this column has at least one outlier and requires our attention.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you might suspect there’s an issue with the data if the data type does not match the expected one. For example, the header of the total_sqft column below is marked with the  symbol, which in PyCharm indicates that the column contains the Object data type. The most appropriate data type for a column like total_sqft would likely be float or integer, however, so we may expect there to be inconsistencies in the data types within the column, which could affect data processing and analysis. After sorting, we notice one possible reason for the discrepancy: the use of text in data and ranges instead of numerical values.\n\n\n\n\nSo, our suspicion that the column had data-type inconsistencies was proven correct. As this example shows, small details in the table header can provide important information about your data and alert you to issues that need to be addressed, so it’s always worth checking.You can also use no-code visualizations to gather information about whether your data needs to be cleaned. Simply click on the  icon in the top-left corner of the table. There are many available visualization options, including histograms, that can be used to see where the peaks of the distribution are, whether the distribution is skewed or symmetrical, and whether there are any outliers.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you can use code to gather information about your dataset and fix any problems you’ve identified. However, the mentioned low-code features often provide valuable insights about your data and can help you work with it much faster.\nCode faster \nCode completion and quick documentation\nA significant portion of a data professional’s job involves writing code. Fortunately, PyCharm is well known for its features that allow you to write code significantly faster. For example, local ML-powered full line code completion can provide suggestions for entire lines of code.\n\n\n\n\nAnother useful feature is quick documentation, which appears when you hover the cursor over your code. This allows you to gather information about functions and other code elements without having to leave the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nRefactorings\nOf course, working with code and data is an interactive process, and you may often decide to make some changes in your code – for example, to rename a variable. Going through the whole file or, in some cases, the entire project, would be cumbersome and time consuming. We can use PyCharm’s refactoring capabilities to rename a variable, introduce a constant, and make many other changes in your code. For example, in this case, I want to rename the DataFrame to make it shorter. I simply use the the Rename refactoring to make the necessary changes.\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm offers a vast number of different refactoring options. To dive deeper into this functionality, watch this video.\nFix problems\nIt is practically impossible to write code without there being any mistakes or typos. PyCharm has a vast array of features that allow you to spot and address issues faster. You will notice the Inspection widget in the top-right corner if it finds any problems.  \n\nFor example, I forgot to import a library in my project and made several typos in the doc so let’s take a look how PyCharm can help here. \nFirst of all, the problem with the library import:\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, with Jupyter traceback, you can see the line where the error occurred and get a link to the code. This makes the bug-fixing process much easier. Here, I have a typo in line 3. I can easily navigate to it by clicking on the blue text.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally if you would like to get more information and suggestion how to fix the problem, you can use JetBrains AI Assistant by clicking on Explain with AI. \n\n\n\n\nOf course, that is just the tip of the iceberg. We recommend reading the documentation to better understand all the features PyCharm offers to help you maintain code quality.\nNavigate easily\nFor the majority of cases, data science work involves a lot of experimentation, with the journey from start to finish rarely resembling a straight line.\nDuring this experimentation process, you have to go back and forth between different parts of your project and between cells in order to find the best solution for a given problem. Therefore, it is essential for you to be able to navigate smoothly through your project and files. Let’s take a look at how PyCharm can help in this respect.\nFirst of all, you can use the classic CMD+F (Mac) or CTRL+F (Windows) shortcut for searching in your notebook. This basic search functionality offers some additional filters like Match Case or Regex.\n\n\n\n\nYou can use Markdown cells to structure the document and navigate it easily.\n\n\n\n\nIf you would like to highlight some cells so you can come back to them later, you can mark them with #TODO or #FIXME, and they will be made available for you to dissect in a dedicated window.\n\n\n\n\nOr you can use tags to highlight some cells so you’ll be able to spot them more easily.\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases, you may need to see the most recently executed cell; in this case, you can simply use the Go To option. \n\n\n\n\nSave your work\nBecause teamwork is essential for data professionals, you need tooling that makes sharing the results of your work easy. One popular solution is Git, which PyCharm supports with features like notebook versioning and version comparison using the Diff view. You can find an in-depth overview of the functionality in this tutorial.\nAnother useful feature is Local History, which automatically saves your progress and allows you to revert to previous steps with just a few clicks.\n\n\n\n\nUse the full power of AI Assistant\nJetBrains AI Assistant helps you automate repetitive tasks, optimize your code, and enhance your productivity. In Jupyter notebooks, it also offers several unique features in addition to those that are available in any JetBrains tool. \nClick the  icon to get insights regarding your data. You can also ask additional questions regarding the dataset or ask AI Assistant to do something – for example, “write some code that solves the missing data problem”.\n\n\n\n\nAI data visualization\nPressing the icon  will suggest some useful visualizations for your data. AI Assistant will generate the proper code in the chat section for your data.\n\n\n\n\nAI cell\nAI Assistant can create a cell based on a prompt. You can simply ask it to create a visualization or do something else with your code or data, and it will generate the code that you requested. \n\n\n\n\nDebugger\nPyCharm offers advanced debugging capabilities to enhance your experience in Jupyter notebooks. The integrated Jupyter debugger allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions directly within your notebooks. This powerful tool helps you step through your code cell by cell, making it easier to identify and fix issues as they arise. Read our blog post on how you can debug a Jupyter notebook in PyCharm for a real-life example.\n\n\n\n\nGet started with PyCharm Professional\nPyCharm’s Jupyter support enhances your data science workflows by combining the interactive aspects of Jupyter notebooks with advanced IDE features.

Please donate if you can and help reshare ❤️‍🩹\n\"PHP is beautiful and powerful\"\n        \n    \nPHP Core\n✅ RFC: Asymmetric Visibility v2 💜\n        Thanks to Ilija Tovilo’s and Larry Garfield’s proposal, PHP 8.4 will have asymmetric visibility, i.e. possibility to make properties public for reading (get) and private for changing (set). The syntax was inspired by Swift.\n    \n✅ RFC: Lazy Objects 💜\n        Lazy objects are standard objects except that their initialization is deferred until one of their properties is accessed (including non-existing ones). This can be useful\nVery likely, the lazy objects won’t be used directly by most PHP users, but package and framework authors will benefit from it a lot as it allows them to remove a lot of boilerplate code. Here is for example how symfony/var-exporter will be simplified:\n        \n    \n✅ RFC: Transform exit() from a language construct into a standard function 💜\nGina Peter Banyard proposed to make exit() a proper function with the following signature: function exit(string|int $status = 0): never {}\nThe benefit is that it will properly validate the arguments passed and throw a TypeError if you pass something irrelevant, such as an array or resource.\n📣 RFC: Improve language coherence for the behaviour of offsets and containers 💜\nPHP supports offset accesses using brackets [] with the following notation $container[$offset]. However, the behavior of such accesses depends not only on the container type and offset, but also on the operation that is performed when accessing the offset.

This decision was primarily based on EAP usage statistics and early research. It also allowed us to price RustRover more competitively.\nHowever, after the release, we received a large number of requests from our community asking us to support these technologies. Another piece of feedback we received was that the single subscription model (commercial), as opposed to our existing one for all our other products (for individual use and for organizations), made it difficult for many to choose the right subscription for their needs.\nIn response to this feedback, we’re making some changes as of v2024.2.

        "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Sep 2024 14:16:13 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we move through 2024, Laravel continues to solidify its position as one of the most popular PHP frameworks, powering a multitude of web applications across the globe. In this blog post, we’ll analyze the recently published State of Laravel 2024 survey results, highlighting key takeaways and what they mean for developers, companies, and the broader PHP community. \nThis year’s survey saw participation from 4,090 respondents across all continents (excluding Antarctica), with the majority hailing from Europe and Asia (49.8% and 20.15%, respectively). Notably, most respondents are experienced developers with 10–20 years of overall experience and 5–10 years of experience with Laravel.\n\n\n\n\nThe growing popularity of Laravel\nLaravel’s appeal has only grown over the years, as evidenced by the recent JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey. According to this survey, Laravel remains the most popular PHP framework, with a significant number of developers reporting they use it regularly in their projects. \n\nTop primary code editors\nA notable result of the State of Laravel survey pertains to the preferred primary code editors among Laravel developers. PhpStorm has been the most popular choice for ages, and in this iteration of the survey it was favored by 54.01% of respondents. This IDE, enhanced by the Laravel Idea plugin, offers a comprehensive feature set specifically tailored for Laravel development.\nFollowing PhpStorm, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the editor of choice for 40.24% of respondents, while Sublime Text ranks third with 2.18% of responses.\n\n\n\n\nLaravel versions and use cases\nOne key trend in the results is the widespread adoption of newer Laravel versions. With the recent release of Laravel 11, many developers are eager to upgrade their projects to leverage the latest improvements and features. However, the results also indicate that a significant number of projects are still running on Laravel 9 and 10. This suggests that while the community is enthusiastic about new versions, the migration process can be challenging, particularly for larger or more complex applications.\n\n\n\n\nThe results also provide valuable insights into the application contexts where Laravel is most commonly used. Almost all respondents (95.40%) reported using Laravel for business applications, while 57.90% use it for hobby projects.\nPHP version preferences\nFrom the survey results, it is evident that there is a strong preference among Laravel developers for using the latest PHP version. This trend is not surprising given the new features introduced in PHP 8.3, such as readonly clones, the #[Override] attribute, and the json_validate function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebugging approaches\nIt is also interesting to look at the approaches developers take to debugging within Laravel. According to the survey results, most developers (89.63%) rely heavily on traditional debugging techniques such as using the dd() and dump() functions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n“It’s interesting that the majority of PHP and Laravel developers still prefer var_dump equivalents over a debugger. My experience, and that of many developers, is that there’s still too much friction in setting up and toggling Xdebug on a day-by-day basis. I hope PhpStorm will be able to remove some, if not all, of that friction in the near future, as we’re working on improved Xdebug support.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate\n                                    \nCheck out Brent’s reflections on the 2024 State of Laravel results in his latest video stream:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrations and the expanding Laravel ecosystem\nLaravel’s ability to integrate seamlessly with other technologies is another reason for its growing popularity. The survey results show that many Laravel projects are built with a wide range of integrations, from APIs and third-party services to complex database architectures.\nIn particular, Laravel’s own tools for the ecosystem like Laravel Forge (for server management), Laravel Vapor (for serverless deployment on AWS), and Laravel Nova (an administration panel for Laravel applications) are gaining traction. These tools simplify many aspects of development, deployment, and maintenance, allowing developers to focus more on coding and less on infrastructure management.\n\n\n\n\nThe future of Laravel\nLooking ahead, the survey results indicate a promising future for Laravel. The framework’s maintainers consistently deliver regular updates and introduce new features to keep Laravel at the cutting edge of PHP development. For the latest on these updates, including new features and improvements, you can explore the detailed Laravel Release Notes.\nThe Laravel community is also incredibly active, with numerous online courses, YouTube videos, and vibrant forums, as well as a wealth of resources tailored to various learning preferences. For a comprehensive compilation of resources and tutorials to support your journey, check out Laracasts, a platform offering high-quality video tutorials and courses on Laravel and other web development topics, designed to help developers of all skill levels enhance their knowledge and skills.\nConclusion\nThe State of Laravel survey results offer a comprehensive snapshot of the current trends and challenges within the Laravel ecosystem. For developers and companies working with Laravel, it is essential to stay informed about these trends and adapt accordingly. By leveraging the insights from this survey and staying active in the Laravel community, you can ensure that your projects remain at the forefront of web development in 2024 and beyond.",

If you want to know more than just the syntax of these new features – the bigger picture, behind-the-scenes stories, and real-life experiences of experts – then this is what JEP Explained is all about!\nJEP Explained is a series of interviews with Java leaders and experts that are closely involved with creating the new Java features. We aim to help developers, organizations, and anyone interested to understand the new Java features beyond just their syntax and learn how to use them effectively.\nInterviews published till date\nWe have published a couple of interviews in this series till date. Here’s the list of the published interviews, with a link to the interview recording and quick details about each episode.\nJEP Explained. JEP 455: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch\nIn this episode, we were privileged to interview Brian Goetz, Java language Architect with Oracle, Aggelos Biboudis, Principal Member Technical Staff, Oracle, and Tagir Valeev, Java Team Technical Lead, JetBrains on JEP 455.\n\nFind out the bigger picture of why primitive data types are being added to the Java language and the finer details of the changes they propose, while also getting a quick demo on how to use them in your codebase.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where all these experts try their luck with tongue twisters, clarify whether some statements are a myth or a fact, and the super fun section when they respond to statements by enacting emojis.\n JEP Explained. JEP 482: Flexible Constructor Bodies\nThis episode of “JEP Explained” covers JEP 482, about proposed changes to constructors that relaxing rules to make them more flexible. With this proposed change, you can execute statements before calling super() or this() in a constructor and initialize members of a derived class before calling a parent constructor.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, a prize winning author, long time professor, Java Champion, and organizer of the Dev2Next conference in Denver.\nIn this interview, Dr. Venkat talks about and demos the issues in your codebase without this change and the benefits of this feature.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Dr. Venkat tries his luck with tongue twisters, clarifies whether some statements are fact or fiction, and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP 477: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods\nThis episode of “JEP Explained” covers JEP 477, which deals with implicitly declared classes and instance main methods.\n\nThe goal of this JEP is to simplify getting started with Java for new Java developers. It does so by introducing simple yet significant changes, like changing the signature of the ‘main’ method from ‘public static void main(String[])’ to ‘void main()’, changing the need to use ‘System.out.println()’ to using ‘println()’, and much more.\nIn this episode, I interviewed Ken Fogel, Department Chairperson Program Coordinator of the Computer Science Technology Program at Dawson College,\nIn this interview, Ken talks about the relevance of these changes for new Java developers and how it will help those teaching “Java 101” to focus on the concepts that benefit beginners the most. Ken also talks about how the new feature can help students to stay focused on building strong computing and logic-building foundations and be introduced to new concepts in an incremental manner.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Ken tries his luck with tongue twisters (he aced it), and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP 466: Class-File API\nThis episode of JEP Explained focuses on JEP 466, which covers the Class-File API, which is designed for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed Rafael Winterhalter, a Java Champion, consultant, blogger, conference speaker, and author of Byte Buddy – a Runtime code generator for the Java virtual machine.\nIn the interview, Rafael talks about the relevance of the Class-File API; which applications, frameworks, or libraries would use it; and how the developers have been parsing, generating, and transforming source code files until now. He covers the different kinds of transformations that are available and how Byte Buddy, a file transformation tool he authored, works.\nRafael also talked about the benefits and drawbacks of the Class-File API, drawing on his hands-on experience with Byte Buddy.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Rafael tries his luck with tongue twisters (he aced it) and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP480: Structured Concurrency\nThis episode of JEP Explained focuses on JEP 480, which covers structured concurrency and introduces an API for this new feature. You can find more information on structured concurrency and virtual threads here.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed José Paumard, Java Champion, author, speaker, developer advocate, oracle, former university professor, JUG leader, conference organizer, JavaOne Rockstar, and presenter of the JEP Cafe series on Java’s YouTube channel.\nJosé started the interview by discussing who this JEP is for and the benefits and shortcomings of structured concurrency. He then went on to highlight the essence of structured concurrency – how it makes it easy to debug, test, and observe concurrent applications. He also demonstrated structured concurrency using hands-on examples.\nDon’t miss the fun segments at the end, where José tries his luck with tongue twisters, and the part when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nIn the last section, José mentioned a couple of unconferences. Here are the links to them if you are interested:\nJalapeño, Mexico\nJChateau, France\n JAlbas, Scotland\nJCrete, Greece\nInterviews in pipeline\nWe are planning, recording or editing more JEP Explained interviews and we’ll publish them soon. You can expect to view interviews on the following listed JEPs:\nJEP 467: Markdown Documentation Comments\nSummary\nWith JEP Explained Interview series, we hope to help you not just understand and use new Java features, but also know about their stories, their relevance and importance. We want you to understand Java features beyond their syntax by bringing to you insights from JEP owners and authors, or leaders and experts with hands-on experience.\nHappy watching and learning!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Have you ever spent hours debugging your C++ code, struggling to set up the right conditional breakpoint or tracepoint? Or wished for a smarter way to obtain detailed runtime information without manually crafting complex expressions? You’re in luck! With Visual Studio 2022, the latest GitHub Copilot feature now offers AI-generated expressions for both conditional breakpoints and tracepoints, available from C# 17.10 and now extended to C++. With these AI-generated conditional breakpoints and tracepoints, you can now automate the creation of intelligent expressions tailored to your specific debugging needs, significantly speeding up the process and enhancing your ability to diagnose and resolve issues.\n\nWhat are conditional breakpoints and tracepoints?\nConditional breakpoints and tracepoints are powerful debugging tools that enhance your ability to control and monitor code execution. A conditional breakpoint pauses execution only when a specified condition is true, making it ideal for targeting specific scenarios. For example, you can halt code only when a variable exceeds a certain value or a function is called with particular parameters, while a Tracepoints enable logging of messages to the output window or a file without interrupting code execution and replaces traditional ‘printf’ statements, offering detailed runtime insights without the need for code recompilation.\nThese tools are invaluable for identifying bugs, testing various scenarios, and tracking variables and expression values without manually stepping through each line of code. However, crafting the correct expressions for conditional breakpoints or tracepoints can be challenging and time-consuming, especially when remembering the correct syntax in complex codebases.\nFortunately, with GitHub Copilot you have the flexibility to choose from predefined conditions that suit your needs or to define custom conditions for precise and efficient debugging.\nHow can AI-generated expressions help you debug faster?\nVisual Studio 2022 integrates with GitHub Copilot, AI-powered code completion tool that suggests lines of code or entire functions, effectively acting as a pair programmer that enhances coding efficiency. When you position the cursor in the textbox for a conditional breakpoint or tracepoint, GitHub Copilot promptly provides three AI-generated expression suggestions based on your codebase. You can choose the most suitable condition or create your own custom conditions as needed.\nWith AI-generated expressions, you can save time and effort by letting GitHub Copilot do the hard work for you. You can also discover new ways of writing expressions that you might not have thought of before. AI-generated expressions can help you debug your code faster and more effectively and learn from the suggestions along the way.\nHow to use AI-generated expressions in Visual Studio 2022 ?\nTo use AI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints in Visual Studio 2022, you need to have a GitHub account and sign in with GitHub in Visual Studio. You also need to make sure Tools > Options > Debugging > enable AI suggestions for breakpoint expressions” is enabled.\nOnce you have enabled GitHub Copilot, you can start using AI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints in your C++ code.\n\nYou can also use keyboard shortcuts to navigate and select the suggestions. Use Ctrl+Space to invoke the suggestion list, use the up and down arrow keys to move through the list, and use Enter to select a suggestion.\nTry it and let us know what you think\nWe hope you enjoy using AI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints in Visual Studio 2022. This feature aims to make debugging your C++ code faster and easier. We’d love your feedback and suggestions for improvement.

Applications like Visual Studio rely on token-based authentication to access resources on your behalf. While effective, token-based authentication can be susceptible to attacks if not properly protected. Today, we are happy to announce that starting with the Visual Studio 17.11 update, we are helping better protect your credentials by making the Windows authentication broker, also known as WAM (Web Access Manager), the default authentication method for Visual Studio 2022.\nDownload Visual Studio 17.11\n\n\nBenefits of Using WAM\nEnhanced Security\nOne of the most significant advantages of WAM is the enhanced security it offers you. By supporting conditional access policies that create a cryptographically secure tie between the token and your device, WAM helps mitigate common vulnerabilities associated with token-based authentication. In addition, WAM can leverage rich OS capabilities such as Windows Hello & FIDO (Fast ID Online) keys to streamline your experience while helping ensure your credentials are better protected against bad actors.\nSimplified User Experience\nBeyond enhancing your security, WAM seamlessly integrates with the Windows account infrastructure, helping to provide you with a consistent and reliable authentication experience across your applications.\nThis integration helps reduce the overall number of authentications prompts you see inside Visual Studio and allows you to leverage your accounts without having to remember and constantly re-enter your credentials.\nGetting started with WAM\nTo begin leveraging the benefits of WAM, ensure that your Visual Studio is updated to version 17.11 or later. Once updated, WAM will be enabled by default, and you can start experiencing the enhanced security and productivity it offers.\nYou can validate that WAM is enabled by opening the Accounts settings under Tools > Options:\n\nCheck our docs for additional details regarding using WAM inside Visual Studio 2022.\nLet us know about your experience\nWe continue to prioritize the security and usability of Visual Studio and are committed to providing the tools and resources you need to build secure, high-performing applications.\nWe look forward to sharing more about what’s next for security. In the meantime, we hope that you enjoy the new WAM authentication experience in Visual Studio and that it makes your development workflow more productive.\nIf you experience any issues or have feedback, please let us know by using the Report a Problem tool in Visual Studio or by posting on the Developer Community or in the comments below.

B2B 제품을 만들고 있는데 영업 속도가 느리고 매출 성장이 너무 더뎌서 매우 초조해하고 스트레스 받고 있는 분과의 미팅이었다.\n일단, 기업에 판매할 B2B 제품은 소비자에게 직접 판매하는 B2C 제품보단 주로 시간과 노력이 많이 들어간다. 우리가 투자한 어떤 B2B SaaS 회사들은 제품만 만드는 데 1년이 걸리는 경우도 있다. 이렇게 힘들게 제품을 만들었는데, 이 제품을 기업 고객에게 판매하는 건, 더 힘들고 시간이 많이 필요하다. 첫 번째 B2B 고객을 확보하기 위해서 한 달 이상 영업하는 경우도 자주 보는데, 이렇게 해서 확보한 고객에게 발생하는 매출은 기대 이하이다. 이분은 이런 식으로 하면, 일 년 열심히 영업해도 유료 고객이 15개도 안 될 것이고, 이들로부터 나오는 매출도 크지 않아서, 과연 내가 맞는 방법으로 사업을 하고 있는지, 이렇게 고객 한 명 한 명씩 영업하는 방법이 맞는 건지 스스로에 대한 불신이 있었다. 그리고 주위에서 ‘미친 성장’을 하는 다른 스타트업같이 아주 효율적으로 노가다 없이 스케일 할 수 있는 방법에 대해 깊은 고민을 하고 있었다.\n나는 개인적으로 이 회사는 아주 잘될 것이라고 믿는다. 내 솔직한 의견은, B2C 제품이나, B2B 제품이나, 노가다 없이 스케일 할 수 있는 방법은 없다. 언론에서는 마치 쉽게 사업을 확장하고, 스케일이라는 말을 모든 스타트업이 가져야 할 필수 덕목같이 포장하는데, 나는 큰 스케일은 수많은 작은 노가다가 축적될 때 나올 수 있다고 생각한다. 요샌 웬만한 사람들이 다 사용하는 드롭박스 같은 제품도 사업 초반에는 창업자가 직접 지인들 사무실을 방문해서 이들의 PC에 제품을 설치해 주고, 사용법을 가르쳐주면서 성장했고, 에어비앤비도 창업자들이 직접 호스트의 숙소를 방문해서 사진을 찍어서 대신 올려주면서 성장했다. 우리 투자사 당근도 판교에서 아주 작게 시작했는데, 창업자들이 직접 물건을 하나씩 올려서 판매하면서 시작했다.\n동네 가게를 위한 B2B 제품을 만들고 있다면, 우리가 만든 제품을 어떻게 하면 최소한의 노력으로 가장 많은 동네 가게 사장님들에게 한 방에 크게 노출할 수 있는지 고민할 시간에, 그냥 하루 종일 동네 가게 문 두드리고 찾아가서 영업하는 게 맞는 방법이라고 생각한다. 이렇게 하루 종일 뚜벅뚜벅 걸어 다니면서 고객의 목소리를 직접 듣고, 이들에게 직접 제품을 설치해 주다 보면, 진짜 사업에 대해서 배울 수 있고, 세상이 정확히 어떻게 돌아가는지 몸으로 배우게 된다. 그러면서도 이렇게 고객 한 명씩 상대하면서 노가다 작업을 하는 게 맞는 방법인지 계속 스스로 의심하겠지만, 고객 한 명이 두 명이 되고, 두 명이 다섯 명이 되고, 다섯 명이 50명이 되면서, 그때부터 사업엔 스케일이 생길 것이다. 하지만, 스케일이 생기기 전 까진 그냥 옛날 방식대로 하나씩 해야 한다. 소위 말하는 노가다를 뛰어야 한다.\n스케일은 가만히 책상에 앉아서 손가락으로 만들어지지 않는다. 직접 발로 뛰어야 하고, 이런 노가다를 계속하다 보면 어느 순간 큰 스케일이 만들어진다. 대신, 멈추지 말고 계속 해야 한다. 내가 이전 포스팅에서도 말했지만, 세상의 모든 큰 일은 아주 작은 일을 계속하는 것에서 시작된다.",

(나도 소셜 포지션이 있답니다~) 대신, ‘이제는 덕질이 커리어와 같은 레벨이 되었구나’라는 생각이 떠올랐다.\n그리고 8년이 지났다. 지금 ‘아미’는 팬덤의 대명사이자 케이팝의 글로벌 영향력을 상징하는 단어가 되었다. 또한 팬덤은 일종의 개념으로도 자리잡고 있다. 2016년엔 대기업 상무님의 ‘덕밍아웃’이 쿨하게 여겨졌다면, 2024년엔 신입 마케터 채용 조건에 ‘덕질’을 언급할 만큼 일반화되었다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}이제 팬덤은 사업적으로도, 산업적으로도 중요한 요소가 되었다.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}음악 산업에서 팬덤이 중요해진 이유\n2024년 현재, 스포티파이 기준 하루에 업로드되는 음악은 12만 곡 정도다. 오타가 아니다. 12만 곡이다. 1곡 당 최소 3분으로 잡으면(음악의 길이는 점점 짧아져서 이젠 3분 30초가 보통이다) 총 6천 시간, 250일이 된다. 하루에 업로드되는 음악을 듣는 데에만 거의 1년의 시간이 필요하다. 그런데 음악만 이럴까? 유튜브는 더하다. 2018년 기준으로 유튜브에는 1분마다 약 500시간 분량의 콘텐츠가 업로드되는데, 이걸 다 보려면 82년이 걸린다.\n그러니까 콘텐츠의 생산 수준은 이미 상식을 벗어났다는 얘기다. 그래도 생산 속도가 좀 느리진 않을까? 천만에. 생성형 AI가 가세하면서 그 속도는 상상 이상으로 빨라지고 있다. 1년만 지나도 영상과 음악 콘텐츠는 지금의 몇 배는 늘어날 수 있다. 우리는 인류 역사상 한 번도 경험하지 못한 콘텐츠 무한공급의 시대를 살고 있다. 그리고 이 시대야말로 문화예술을 사랑하는 사람들이 상상하던 바로 그 ‘문화 예술이 일상이 된 시대’다. 어서오세요, 문화 예술 콘텐츠가 흘러넘치는 디스토피아에.\n생산자로서는 노출이 중요해질 수밖에 없다. 세상 어딜 둘러봐도 ‘마케팅’이 문제고, 곳곳에서 마케터가 자주 눈에 띄는 이유다. 그런데 마케팅의 역할은 애초에 광고 집행이 아니라 효율적인 시장을 개발하는 것이다. 시장이 있어야 광고도 쓸모 있으니까. 그런데 지금은 미디어가 많아도 너무 많다. 기껏해야 텔레비전, 신문, 잡지, 라디오가 전부였던 ‘매스 미디어’ 시대에는 몇 개의 광고만으로도 큰 관심을 얻을 수 있었다. 우리 제품을 사주세요! 우리 음악을 들어주세요! 우리 영화 보러 극장에 오세요!\n하지만 지금은 무수히 많은 콘텐츠 채널과 앱 서비스가 알아서 돌아가는 시대다. 스마트폰 사용자는 전세계 55억명을 돌파했고, 이들은 스마트폰을 개인용 TV, 극장, 오디오, 게임기로 쓰고 있다. 55억개의 미디어가 존재하는 셈이다. 있는 줄도 몰랐던 유튜브 채널의 구독자가 5만, 10만, 20만이라는 걸 알게 되었을 때 얼마나 당황스러웠는지 떠올려보자. 2024년은 콘텐츠도 많은데 그걸 안내하고 유통하는 채널도 무수히 많은 시대다.\n그래서 팬덤이 중요해졌다. 팬덤의 부상은 미디어 분화의 결과다. 팬덤은 명확한 타깃의 총합이다. 홍보 효과가 큰 반면, 마케팅 비용은 적게 든다. 전환율도 높다. 팬은 기능이나 가격이 아니라 스토리와 드라마에 끌리는 사람들이다. 그래서 공감이 중요하다. 소비자들은 천천히 마음을 열다가  마침내 시간과 애정이라는 고귀한 ‘자원’을 쓰는 팬이 된다. 한국의 케이팝 팬들은 이들을 ‘덕후’라고 부른다. 다른 업계에서는 ‘찐팬’이라고 부른다. 해외에서는? ‘슈퍼 팬’이라고 부른다.\n슈퍼 팬은 왜 중요할까? \n음악 업계에서 ‘슈퍼 팬’이란 말이 유행한 것은 최근의 일이다. 음악, 영화, TV에 대한 방대한 데이터를 분석하는 회사 루미네이트(1990년에 빌보드 차트의 현대적 솔루션을 만든 회사다)는 2023년 7월에 50페이지 분량의 상반기 음악시장 보고서를 발표했는데, 여기서 ‘슈퍼 팬’이라는 개념이 본격적으로 등장했다.\n음악 산업에서 슈퍼 팬은 스트리밍 청취, 뮤직비디오 시청, 음반 구매*, 공연 참여, 굿즈 구매 등 최소 5가지 이상의 방법으로 한 아티스트의 콘텐츠를 소비하고 관계를 맺는 사람들로 정의한다. 미국의 슈퍼 팬은 일반 리스너와 비교해서 매달 음악에 80% 이상의 돈을 쓰는데 루미네이트는 이러한 슈퍼 팬이 미국 음악 시장 전체에서 최소한 15%를 차지한다고 분석했다. 특히 밀레니얼 세대(22% 이상), Z세대(13% 이상)가 주요 그룹이다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*일단 피지컬(실물) 앨범을 구매한다면 슈퍼 팬이 될 가능성이 2배 이상 높다.\n우리는 이 슈퍼 팬이 대부분 케이팝 팬일 거라고 예상하지만 놀랍게도 아니다. 압도적으로 높은 것은 아프로-팝(블랙뮤직)의 팬들이고, 그 다음이 케이팝, 그 다음에 EDM이다. 다만 케이팝 팬들은 다른 장르 팬들에 비해 음반과 굿즈를 더 많이 구매한다. 그래서 미국 음악 업계는 요즘 케이팝에 관심이 많다. 대체 무슨 요술을 부리길래 저렇게 많은 팬들이 저렇게 많은 CD와 굿즈를 사는 걸까? 2024년인데! 딱 이런 궁금증이 케이팝에 대한 관심과 호감을 키운다. 유니버설뮤직그룹(UMG)이 하이브와 계약을 맺고, 워너뮤직그룹(WMG)이 위버스와 비슷한 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}팬덤 플랫폼을 만들겠다고 하는 것도 같은 이유다.\n사실 음악 산업의 비즈니스 모델은 슈퍼 팬을 찾는 방법에서부터 시작된다. 이때 팬을 찾는 방법론은 기존의 마케팅 방법론과는 다를 수밖에 없다. 팬은 소비자가 아니다. 팬은 부가 가치도 아니다. 팬은 수익 그 자체를 만드는 존재이면서 동시에 산업을 지탱하는 기반이기도 하다. 콘텐츠 비즈니스에서 슈퍼 팬은 비즈니스 모델의 처음이자 끝이다. 그런데 또한, 팬은 비즈니스 관점으로만 설명할 수 없는 존재다. 수익율과 전환율 같은 이런저런 지표를 관통하면서 팬은 마침내 문화를 만든다. 그래서 중요하다. 팬을 찾고 싶다면 결국 팬을 관찰하고 팬 문화를 경험할 수밖에 없다. 그걸 통해 팬을 어떻게 정의하고, 팬과 어떤 관계를 맺으며, 팬과 무엇을 함께 할 것인지 발견할 수밖에 없다. 그게 바로 팬덤 비즈니스다.\n팬덤 비즈니스를 하고 싶다면\n음악 산업의 슈퍼 팬을 이해해야 한다\n사실, 음악계 뿐 아니라 누구든 팬을 원하는 시대다. 여기서 ‘누구나’란 말이 질소로 빵빵한 과자 포장지 같을지 모르겠지만, 사실은 사실이다. 정말로 누구나 팬을 원한다.\n2021년부터 ‘팬덤 경영’을 강조한 LG는 지금도 팬을 만들기 위해 다양한 전략을 구사하고 있다. 애플은 말할 것도 없고, 짝퉁으로 놀림받던 샤오미와 다이소도 이제는 팬덤을 기반으로 사업을 확장한다. [어벤저스4: 엔드 게임] 이후 지지부진하던 마블은 어떤가? 얼마 전 공개한 [어벤져스5: 둠스데이]의 메인 빌런 ‘닥터 둠’으로 로버트 다우니 주니어를 섭외했다. 그가 연기한 슈퍼히어로이자 팬층이 두터웠던 ‘아이언 맨’은 전작에서 사망해 MCU에서 영영 사라졌는데, 신작에서 갑자기 우주 최강 빌런으로 부활한 것이다. 마블은 이제 꽤 복잡한 퍼즐을 맞춰야겠지만, 팬들은 일단 열광했다.\nF&B 업계에서도 팬은 중요하다. 올해 4월, ‘한식의 글로벌'이라는 주제로 [난로 인사이트 2024]라는 컨퍼런스가 열렸다. 행사에는 월드 챔피언 레스토랑으로 꼽히는 스페인의 센트럴(Central)과 디스푸르타르(Disfrutar)의 셰프들, 미국에서 한식 푸드트럭의 신화를 쓴 컵밥(CUPBOP)의 송정훈 대표, 유럽에서 한식 프랜차이즈를 개척 중인 요리(YORI)의 김종순 대표와 같은 사업가들이 참여했는데, 그곳에서 나는 케이팝과 뉴진스, 팬덤 비즈니스에 대해 발표했다. 행사가 끝나고도 여러 셰프들과 자리를 옮기며 글로벌, 브랜딩, 팬덤에 대해 동이 틀 때까지 대화를 나눴다.\n유튜브가 매년 발행하는 ‘컬쳐 & 트렌드 리포트’의 2024년 주제*도 '팬덤'이었다. 유튜버만큼 팬들이 중요하다는 얘기였다. 그야말로, 지금은 팬의 시대다. 그래서 아티스트나 크리에이터들 뿐 아니라 브랜드 마케터, 콘텐츠 기획자들은 팬을 관찰하고, 팬 문화를 더 많이 경험할 필요가 있다. \n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n📝 유튜브의 컬쳐 & 트렌드 리포트 2024에서는 \n\n팬이 콘텐츠 소비자가 아니라 적극적인 창작자로 진화하고 있다는 점을 짚었다. 숏폼 동영상 제작 툴과 생성형 AI 등 기술 발전으로 팬 참여가 급진적으로 쉬워지면서 캐주얼 팬이 적극적으로 돈을 지불하는 빅 팬이 되거나, 팬심으로 수익까지 창출하는 프로 팬으로 변화하고 있다는 것이다. \n특히 미국의 Z세대 65%가 자신을 ‘크리에이터'로 인식하고, 그 중 8%가 프로 팬으로서 수익을 창출한다는 부분이 흥미로웠다. 20세기의 팬들이 대상을 동경하면서 추종했다면, 21세기 팬들은 대상을 가지고 놀면서 수평적인 관계를 만든다.\n\n앞서 언급한 루미네이트의 보고서에는 음악의 슈퍼 팬이 왜 중요할 수밖에 없는지에 대한 이유가 등장한다. 음악의 슈퍼 팬은 스포츠 팬*에 비해 브랜드 파트너십에 매우 호의적이다. 쉽게 말해 아티스트가 어떤 브랜드의 광고 모델이 된다고 해도 거부감이 거의 없다. 음악이 브랜드 광고에 쓰여도 그러려니 한다. 오히려 자연스럽게 브랜드 구매로 이어지거나, 다른 사람들에게 적극적으로 그 브랜드를 알리기도 한다. 심지어 음악 팬들은 스포츠 팬에 비해 온라인 쇼핑이나 화장품, 배달 음식에 대해서도 더 호의적이다. \n*미국 사회에서 팬은, 한국과 달리 여전히 서브컬쳐에 머무는 존재다. 할리우드 청춘 영화나 드라마에서 사회성 부족한 인물이 ‘덕후’나 ‘너드’ 캐릭터로 등장하는 것도 그런 이유다. 그나마 ‘의미있는 집단’으로서의 슈퍼 팬은 스포츠에 국한되는데, 보통 미식축구, 농구, 야구 팬들을 대상으로 한 연구가 많았다. 음악의 슈퍼 팬에 대한 연구는 이제 시작 단계다. 그래서 종종 스포츠의 팬들과 비교된다. \n쉽게 말해, 음악 팬들은 일반 소비자보다 자신이 좋아하는 것에 더 많은 돈과 시간을 쓴다. 우리 비즈니스의 팬덤을 음악의 슈퍼 팬처럼 만들 수 있다면 얼마나 좋을까? 이게 바로 화장품 회사든 대기업이든, 음악 팬들을 이해하고 음악 산업을 살펴야봐야 할 이유다. \n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 송수아 Graphic 이은호",

아니 그래 갑자기 이 집이 망하기라도 했다는게냐 엉? 항창 그렇다 치자. 네 남편을 통해 얘기하는거야.”\n- 1973. 1. 4. 동아일보\n위의 내용은 ‘제삿날’이라는 1970년대 동아일보 기사의 일부이다. 치솟는 물가와 부담스러운 제사 비용 때문에 장손의 며느리가 제사 비용을 분담하자고 했다가 숙부들의 분노와 반발을 샀다는 내용이다. 숙부들은 ‘너가 며느리로 들어온 후 제사상이 형편없어졌다.’, ‘할 얘기 있으면 너가 아니라 네 남편이 해야 한다’ 등 모욕적인 말도 서슴치 않았다.\n1960년대 이후 한국 사회는 과도한 제사 비용을 해소하기 위해 머리를 맞대기 시작한다. 정부에서는 전통적인 관혼상제의 허례허식을 줄이고, 절차의 간소화를 위한 ‘가정의례준칙’을 만들어 검소한 제사상을 강제했다. 가족끼리 제사와 차례 비용을 분담하는 방식 역시 이때부터 나온 이야기다.\n첫째, 제사를 꼭 맏아들이 주관할 필요는 없다. 둘째, 형식보다는 내면이기 때문에 고인이 평소 좋아하던 음식으로 제사상을 차리거나 고인의 유품 같은 것을 놓을 것을 권장한다. 셋째, 축문은 한문이 아닌 한글로 써서 조상과 자손 간의 유대 관계를 강화한다. 1970년대 유신 시절 정부는 한바탕 제사상과의 전쟁을 치렀는데 그럼에도 불구하고 제사 자체를 폐지하는 데는 이르지 못했다.\n1980년대가 되면 더욱 구체적인 제사상 가이드가 등장한다. ‘다섯 명 기준으로 2~3만 원 정도’를 적정 제사 비용으로 보았고 이를 실천하기 위해 소고기가 아닌 돼지고기나 닭고기 사용을 권장했고 갈비찜보다는 사태찜, 버섯은 송이버섯보다는 표고버섯이나 느타리버섯, 식혜보다는 화채를 사용하면 비용을 낮출 수 있다는 것이다. 유신 체제 때 강제하던 가정의례준칙은 1999년 폐지되었지만, 90년대 초반까지 보다 실용적인 해법을 도모하며 제사 비용을 아끼려는 노력은 계속 이어졌다.\n하마터면 사라질 뻔했던 추석\n사실 제사 비용보다 문제가 되었던 것은 추석을 비롯한 명절 자체를 없애버리려는 시도였다. 1927년 조선을 점령한 일본은 공휴일제도를 법제화했다. 원시제(양력 1월 3일), 신무천황제(양력 4월 3일), 신상제(양력 10월 17일), 명치절(양력 11월 3일) 등 새롭게 마련된 절기는 철저하게 일본의 문화를 바탕으로 했다.\n그중 신상제는 천황이 신에게 햇곡식을 바치는 제도로써 추석을 대체하는 제도였다. 우리 민족의 명절은 음력을 따라 계산되었는데 일제는 서구화를 도모하면서 양력 공휴일제를 강요한 것이다. 심지어 명절을 맞이해 단체 삭발을 강요하기도 했다. 소위 '스포츠 머리'로 깨끗하고 단정하게 머리를 밀어버리라는 근본없는 문화가 생기기도 했다.\n해방이 되고나니 미국의 영향을 받아 추석을 ‘추석감사일’, 즉 추수감사절과 같은 날로 만들고자 했으니 이 또한 웃지 못할 해프닝이었다. 우여곡절을 거치며 1989년이 되어서야 지금과 같이 음력을 바탕으로 한 설·추석 3일 연휴제가 만들어졌다.\n놀라운 것은 이 기간에도 명절 문화는 유지가 되었다는 점이다. 공휴일이 아니더라도, 일제가 억압을 하고, 정부가 못하게 하더라도 사람들은 명절이 되면 모였고, 세시 풍속을 즐겼고, 덕담을 나누었다. 따져보니 추석은 100년 만에 부활한 셈이다. 앞으로 명절 풍경은 어떻게 변하게 될까? 시대에 어울리는 풍요롭고, 스트레스 없는 추석 명절 문화가 만들어지길 기대해본다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0 8px;cursor:pointer;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--adaptiveGrey700);}\n.css-1dzrkjz{width:16px;margin-right:8px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;}\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper >.svg-icon:empty+.svg-icon-fallback{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}.svg-icon{color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon svg,.svg-icon img{display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon--hide{display:none;}.svg-icon-fallback{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:0;z-index:z-index(hidden);visibility:hidden;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon-fallback--show{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}\n참고자료\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호",

토스의 원앱(One App) 전략이 그 기반이 되어줍니다. 투자, 뱅킹, 보험, 결제 등의 영역에 따라 별도의 앱을 만드는 대신, 하나의 토스 앱에서 모든 영역의 서비스를 제공하는 것을 말해요. \n토스증권, 토스뱅크가 토스 앱 안에서 순차적으로 런칭한 2021년 이후, 토스는 사용자들에게 ‘금융의 슈퍼앱’으로 자리 잡았습니다.\n투자자들은 세 가지 지표를 보고 금융 슈퍼앱 토스가 한국 디지털 금융 시장에서 독보적인 1위라는 사실에 고개를 끄덕입니다.\n첫 번째는 1,900만(2023년 말, 와이즈앱 기준)에 이르는 MAU입니다. 우리나라 인구 3명 중 1명 이상이 토스를 매달 한 번 이상 사용한다는 의미이지요. 두 번째, 무려 600조원을 초과하는 토스 플랫폼의 연간 금융 거래액입니다.\n마지막으로 투자자들이 제일 중요하게 여기는 지표는 ‘인게이지먼트(Engagement)’ 수준입니다. 고객 참여도 또는 앱 활성도라고도 표현하는데요. ‘사용자 수가 많은 것은 알겠는데, 그들이 토스 앱을 얼마나 자주, 유용하게 쓰고 있느냐’고 묻는 것입니다. \n토스팀은 “월간 활성 사용자 중에서도 ‘매일 토스 앱을 쓰는 사용자(DAU)’의 비중이 50% 이상”이라는 답을 내놓습니다.\n여기서 많은 투자자들이 놀랍니다. 소셜 네트워크 서비스나 채팅 앱에서나 가능한 숫자이기 때문이에요. 전 세계에서 가장 많이 쓰는 채팅 앱 왓츠앱의 DAU/MAU가 50% 초반이라고 하니, 토스는 이미 핀테크의 영역을 넘어섰습니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n\n특히 토스 사용자들이 하루 평균 9번 토스 앱을 켠다는 데이터에 해외 투자자들은 감탄합니다. 스스로 ‘슈퍼 앱’이라고 주장하는 앱이 많지만, 토스처럼 ‘슈퍼 앱’ 전략이 제대로 작동해 압도적인 인게이지먼트를 만들어 내는 앱은 전세계적으로 찾아보기 힘들기 때문이에요. \n앞으로의 성장 전략,\n시간이 갈수록 늘어나는 ARPU\n토스는 현재 70가지 넘는 서비스를 11개 카테고리로 구분하는데, 2024년 3월 기준 사용자들은 평균 4.1개 카테고리의 서비스를 넘나들며 토스 앱을 적극적으로 이용하고 있습니다. 또 이렇게 4개 이상 카테고리를 이용하는 사용자의 월간 리텐션은 90%에 달해요. 다음 달에도 토스 앱을 이용하고 있을 확률이 90%라는 뜻입니다.\n토스 앱을 자주 켜고 다양한 서비스를 이용하는 사용자의 행위는 곧 토스의 매출 성장 잠재력으로 이어집니다. 아래 표에서 보는 것처럼 토스의 각 서비스는 ‘전략적인 목표’를 가지고 있는데요.\n\n\n\n송금이나 금융 대시보드, 혜택 등은 토스가 돈을 버는 구조의 서비스는 아니지만, 사용자들이 토스에 가입하고 계속 쓰는 유인이 됩니다. 이후 토스 앱에 모인 사용자들이 간편결제, 금융상품 가입, 주식투자, 뱅킹 등 토스가 매출을 창출해 낼 수 있는 서비스까지 이용하기 시작합니다.\n커머스, 광고, 세금환급 등 새로운 서비스를 론칭했을 때에도, 사용자들은 여전히 토스 앱 안에서 쉽게 접근하고 탐색합니다. 투자자들에게는 “사용자를 획득하고 리텐션 시키는 비용을 최소화하면서 사용자 1인당 매출은 극대화하는 전략”으로 받아들여집니다.\n사용자 1명이 발생시키는 매출을 ARPU(Average Revenue Per User)라고 부르는데요. 사용자가 이용하는 서비스 개수가 늘어날수록 ARPU도 늘어납니다. 토스팀은 특히 사용자의 가입 시점에 따른 서비스 이용 개수와 ARPU의 변화를 유의해서 지켜보고 있어요.\n지난 2018년 토스에 가입한 사용자들은 1개 이하의 서비스만 쓰다가 6년이 지난 지금 평균 4개 이상의 서비스를 이용하는데요. 최근 가입한 사용자들은 처음부터 평균 2.4가지 서비스를 사용하고, 빠르게 4개 이상에 도달하는 추이를 보입니다.\n그만큼 토스의 사용자 대상 서비스 ARPU 역시 빠른 속도로 증가하고 있어요. 2022년 연 22.6달러였던 ARPU는 2023년 26.7달러, 2024년 1분기에는 연환산 기준 34달러로 늘었습니다. 반면 사용자 획득 비용과 서비스 운영 비용은 안정화되며 토스 전체의 수익성은 개선되고 있지요.\n토스의 내일을 기대하는 까닭 \n토스는 사용자 인게이지먼트가 높은 플랫폼 서비스가 더 많은 ARPU를 창출하며 수익성을 확보할 수 있다는 가설을 매순간 증명해 내고 있습니다.\n2024년 2분기에는 처음으로 영업이익(연결 기준)이 흑자로 전환하는 성과를 거뒀어요. 상반기 매출은 작년 같은 기간 대비 40% 가까이 늘어났습니다. 토스증권 등 계열사의 실적도 뛰어났지만, 이번에는 간편결제와 광고, 세무 서비스 등 토스 코어의 사용자 대상 서비스가 크게 성장했던 것도 한 몫 했습니다.\n연 매출 1조원 넘는 기업이 매년 이처럼 큰 폭의 성장세를 기록하는 사례는 굉장히 드뭅니다. 전 세계의 핀테크 회사들을 지켜보는 투자자들이 ‘토스는 아직 더 클 여지가 있구나’ 흥분을 불러 일으키는 대목이자, 토스의 다음 분기, 반기, 내년을 기대하는 까닭입니다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWords 김민우 Edit 정경화 Graphic 조수희・이서영",

5단계\n.css-14on8x8{font-size:17px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:normal;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);margin:24px 0 8px;}\n이사할 때 인테리어를 고치는 사람이 늘어나고 있다. 지어진 지 10년 이상 된 집에 입주할 때뿐 아니라 새 아파트 입주 시에도 인테리어를 취향껏 하고 싶어서 ‘마이너스 옵션(아파트 분양에 있어서, 벽지, 바닥재 등 마감재 품목의 설치 여부를 입주자가 선택하게 하는 것)’을 이용하거나 기본 인테리어를 뜯어내고 다시 할 정도다.\n잡지에 소개된 집처럼 세련되고 개성 있게 고치고 싶지만, 대부분 인테리어에 대한 경험과 지식이 부족하고 예산이 한정되어 있어 공사 시작 전부터 막막하다. 그래서 초보자도 큰 실수 없이 인테리어를 할 수 있는 방법을 5단계로 정리해 보았다.\n1단계. 공사 범위 및 예산 정하기\n무작정 업체부터 방문해서 인테리어 상담을 받기보다는, .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}나중에 수정하더라도 .css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}‘어느 부분을 어떻게 고칠 것인지’를 미리 계획하고 방문하는 것이 좋다. ‘전체 수리’를 할지 아니면 ‘부분 수리’를 할지 결정한 다음, 원하는 스타일을 생각해보는 것이다.\n먼저 수리할 부분을 항목별로 나눠 리스트를 작성한다. 리스트에는 자신이 생각하는 콘셉트 및 총 예산을 쓰고 나서 항목별 원하는 스타일이나 예상하는 예산을 적는다. 인테리어를 진행하다 보면 처음에 계획한 것보다 비용이 초과되는 경우가 많기 때문에 공사 범위, 콘셉트 및 예산 계획을 미리 세우는 것이 중요하다.\n2단계. 견적받기\n적어도 세 곳 이상의 다른 업체에서 견적을 받아 가격을 비교해 봐야 감을 잡을 수 있다. 다섯 곳이 넘어가면 중복되는 내용이 많고 오히려 결정을 늦출 수 있어 일반적으로 서너 곳 정도에서 받아보는 것이 무난하다.\n견적을 받을 때는 반드시 실제 공사할 현장에 방문해서 실측이 이루어져야 한다. 간혹 해당 아파트 단지 공사 경험이 많다는 이유 등으로 현장 방문을 생략하고 견적을 내려는 업체가 있는데, 이런 업체는 과감하게 패스하는 것이 좋다. 아무리 같은 단지, 같은 구조의 아파트라 하더라도 각각의 집마다 공사 여건과 환경 등이 달라질 수 있기 때문이다. 가격은 유독 저렴한 업체와 비싼 업체는 피하고 중간 정도의 가격대를 꼼꼼히 확인해서 내주는 업체로 하는 것이 좋다.\n3단계. 인테리어 업체 선정하기\n인테리어 업체는 믿을 만한지(공사 경험과 A/S), 의뢰인의 의견을 잘 반영해 주는지 등을 중점적으로 살펴본다. 계약서를 작성하기 전에 지역 맘카페에 글을 올려 해당 인테리어 업체에 대한 평판과 반응, 공사 후기 등을 댓글로 살펴보는 것도 좋다. 단, 인테리어 업체에 대한 질문을 올릴 때에는 상호명을 직접적으로 노출하는 것은 피해야 한다. 의도치 않게 업체에 대한 악플이 달려 민원을 받을 수도 있기 때문이다. 구체적인 동네와 초성 처리한 상호 정도로 올려도 같은 지역 사람들은 어느 업체인지 다 알기 때문에 조언의 댓글을 받을 수 있다.\n또한 업체의 대표가 실제 공사에 어느 정도 관여하는지도 중요하다. 일부 업체에서는 견적 및 전체적인 일정만 관리하고 모든 공사와 감독을 하청업체에 맡기기도 한다. 물론 인테리어 업체의 대표가 모든 공정의 기술자가 아니기 때문에 항목별로 하청을 주는 것은 당연하다. 하지만 현장은 늘 대표나 담당직원이 직접 관리·감독하면서 부분적이라도 공사에 직접 참여하고 있어야 한다. 대표가 현장을 관리·감독하는 업체일수록 공사의 만족도도 높고 A/S도 빠른 편이다.\n4단계. 계약서 작성하기\n계약서를 작성할 때는 각 항목별 ‘세부 내역서’도 포함되어 있어야 한다. 전체 공사금액뿐만 아니라 각 항목별 세부금액과 어떠한 자재로 시공되는지 기재해야 한다.\n가끔 ‘싱크대 상급으로 시공’, ‘전등 LED로 시공’ 등과 같이 두루뭉술하게 내역서를 작성하기도 한다. 고객이 생각한 수준 이상으로 시공이 되는 경우도 있지만 반대로 그 이하의 제품으로 시공이 될 수도 있기 때문에 분쟁의 소지가 다분하다. 그러므로 반드시 계약서 작성 시, 공사 항목별로 세분화하여 꼼꼼하게 작성한 내역서가 첨부되어야 한다.\n예를 들어 ‘욕실공사’라는 항목이 있을 때 단순히 ‘욕실 전체 공사 450만 원’이라고 적으면 안 된다. ‘바닥방수재 시공 60만 원, 타일 시공(벽면 250×400, 바닥 200×200) 190만 원, 변기(대림,모델 No.OO) 40만 원…, 합계 450만 원’과 같이 세부적으로 항목별 금액과 제품의 사이즈 또는 모델 번호까지 기재해야 한다.\n또한 공사 기간, A/S 기간 및 범위, 추가 비용 등의 내용이 반드시 포함되어야 한다. 특히 추가 비용에는 공사 현장 여건상 불가피하게 추가로 발생하는 경우와 의뢰인의 요구사항이나 변경사항으로 인해 추가로 발생하는 경우를 나누어 상황별로 어떻게 비용을 처리할지를 명확하게 기재하는 것이 좋다. 세부 내역서를 포함한 계약서는 2부 작성하여 각각 1부씩 보관하고 있어야 한다.\n계약서를 작성할 때는 너무하다는 생각이 들 정도로 꼼꼼하게 작성하는 것이 좋다. 분쟁의 소지가 그만큼 줄어들기 때문이다.\n✅.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}’인테리어 계약서 잘 쓰는 법' 자세히

금액은 참고용이며, 인테리어 공사비는 물가 상승에 따라 꾸준히 오르고 있다.\n5단계. 비용 지급하기\n일반적으로 전체 공사비의 10~20% 정도의 계약금을 계약서 작성 시 지급한다. 중도금은 한 번에 50~60%를 지급하는 경우가 있고, 1차와 2차로 나누어 지급하는 경우도 있다. 한 번에 낼 때는 대개 철거공사가 완료되고 본격적으로 인테리어 공사가 진행될 때 지급한다. 중도금을 나누어 낼 때는 철거공사가 시작될 때와 공사 공정이 중간을 넘기는 시점에 지급하는 경우가 많다.\n잔금 20~30%는 최종적으로 모든 공사가 완료되고 의뢰인이 현장을 점검한 뒤 이상이 없을 경우 지급하면 된다. 의뢰인의 입장에서는 공사가 완료되었다고 해서 바로 잔금을 지급하기보다는 3~4일 정도 후에 지급하는 것이 좋다. 눈에 바로 보이는 하자도 있지만, 실제 사용했을 때 나타나는 하자도 있기 때문이다. 그러므로 며칠 생활을 해보면서 점검 및 확인을 꼼꼼하게 한 후에 잔금을 지급하도록 한다.\n인테리어 공사의 일반적인 진행 순서\n① 공사 준비\n공사가 시작되기 1~2주 전에 아파트 관리사무소에 방문해서 공사의 범위 및 일정을 알린다. 대부분의 관리사무소에서는 해당 동의 같은 라인(혹은 동 전체)에 살고 있는 입주민 2/3 이상의 공사동의서를 받아올 것을 요구한다. (공사동의서와 공사안내문은 대부분 인테리어 업체에서 알아서 진행해준다.) 아파트라면 단지별로 정해진 엘리베이터 사용료도 확인해야 한다.\n② 공사 시작\n본격적인 공사를 시작하기 3~4일 전 엘리베이터, 건물 출입구 등에 공사안내문을 게시한다. 공사안내문에는 공사기간 및 공사의 범위 등을 기재한다. 공사로 인해 소음이 가장 심하게 발생하는 날(욕실, 바닥 타일 등의 철거, 발코니 확장 등)이 언제인지 함께 기재하는 것이 좋다.\n③ 철거 공사\n싱크대와 몰딩 철거는 크게 소음이 나지 않지만, 욕실 타일 철거와 발코니 확장으로 인한 철거 작업 시에는 소음과 먼지가 많이 발생한다. 주변 입주민에게 민원이 들어올 수도 있기 때문에 너무 이른 시간과 늦은 오후 시간에 작업하는 것은 피한다.\n④ 전기 및 설비 공사\n싱크대의 구조를 변경하거나 욕실 배관 등을 교체할 때는 설비 공사가 필요하다. 거실이나 방 발코니를 확장하는 경우, 확장되는 부분 바닥에 보일러 배관 설치가 진행된다.\n⑤ 새시 및 문틀 교체\n발코니 확장 또는 새시 교체, 내부 문(문틀) 교체가 있을 경우, 기존의 틀을 철거 한 후 새로운 틀로 교체한다. 이때 공사의 원활한 진행을 위해 틀만 먼저 설치하고 문(창문)은 공사가 어느 정도 진행된 후에 설치하게 된다.\n⑥ 목공사\n목공사는 목재를 써서 하는 모든 공사를 일컫는 용어다. 인테리어 현장에서 천장 작업, 몰딩 작업, 거실 아트월, 중문 설치 시 가벽 작업 등이 목공사로 진행된다. 이 단계에서 천장에 설치되는 전등의 위치가 최종적으로 정해지기 때문에 자신이 원하는 위치가 있다면 사전에 공사 관계자에게 정확한 위치를 알려주는 것이 좋다. 발코니 확장을 위한 벽면 단열재 공사도 대부분 이때 함께 진행된다.\n⑦ 타일 공사\n인테리어 공사에서 의외로 타일 공사가 차지하는 비중이 크다. 현관 바닥, 싱크대 벽면, 발코니 바닥, 욕실(벽면, 바닥) 등을 동시에 진행하는 경우가 많다. 타일 공사 양이 많을 경우에는 욕실만 따로 작업하기도 한다.\n⑧ 필름지 공사 및 페인트 작업\n필름지(일명 시트지) 공사는 기존의 문이나 가구 등의 표면에 새로운 필름지를 입히는 작업으로 일종의 리폼이라고 생각하면 된다. 예전에는 문, 문틀 등에 페인트칠을 하는 경우가 많았는데, 최근에는 대부분 필름지 작업을 한다.\n필름지의 장점은 작업 후에 냄새가 없고, 색상이 다양하고 면처리가 깔끔해서 리폼의 완성도를 높일 수 있다는 것이다. 단점은 페인트에 비해 가격이 비싸다는 것이다. 최근 페인트 작업은 발코니와 창고 벽면에만 하는 추세다.\n⑨ 도배 및 바닥 공사\n도배와 바닥 시공은 가구가 설치되기 전에 해야 일의 진행속도가 빠르고 편하다. 하지만 가구 공사를 먼저 하는 경우도 있다. 싱크대 같은 가구를 먼저 설치하고 도배해야 가구와 벽면 또는 천장 사이의 이음새 부분을 도배지로 자연스럽게 덮어 가릴 수 있어 마감처리면에서 효과적이기 때문이다.\n반대로 도배를 먼저 한 후 가구를 설치하게 되면 이음새 부분에 미세하게 틈이 생긴다. 미세한 틈을 투명 실리콘으로 마감해도 상관은 없지만 섬세한 작업 결과를 원한다면 가구 설치를 먼저 한 후에 도배 및 바닥공사를 시공하는 것이 좋다.\n참고로 도배 대신 페인트로 시공하려는 경우가 있다. 페인트는 도배지에 비해 색상을 다양하게 연출할 수 있고 비용이 저렴하다는 장점이 있지만, 벽면이 고르지 않을 경우 퍼팅 작업이 병행되어야 하므로 오히려 비용이 추가될 수 있다.\n⑩ 가구 공사\n싱크대, 붙박이장, 신발장 등이 시공된다. 대부분 사전에 디자인과 사이즈 측량이 완료되어 제작된 완성품이 배송되기 때문에 설치만 하면 된다.\n⑪ 전등 및 전기콘센트 커버 교체\n전등과 콘센트 커버는 외관상 노출되는 효과가 크다. 특히 거실과 주방(식탁) 전등의 경우 디자인이나 색상에 따라 집 안의 전체적인 분위기가 달라질 수 있다. 그러므로 업체에서 임의로 설치해주기 전에 본인의 취향에 맞는 디자인을 직접 선택하는 것이 좋다.\n⑫ 액세서리 설치\n발코니 천장의 빨래건조대, 문 손잡이(실린더), 욕실 액세서리(선반, 휴지걸이, 수건걸이 등), 방충망 등을 설치하면서 공사 관계자가 모든 일정을 마무리한다. 이때 커튼 설치를 위한 커튼봉 시공, 액자를 걸기 위한 못질, 인테리어 선반 설치 등등이 필요할 경우 부탁하면 거의 대부분 서비스로 해준다.\n⑬ 입주 청소\n찌든 때는 없지만 먼지가 많기 때문에 입주 청소를 해야 한다. 닦기를 수차례 반복해도 계속해서 먼지가 나오고 생각보다 청소가 쉽지 않다. 그러므로 비용이 들더라도 웬만하면 청소 전문가에게 입주 청소를 맡기는 것이 효율적이다.\n매일 현장에 방문해서 진행사항 체크하는 건 필수\n공사가 진행되는 기간 동안 바쁘더라도 매일 현장에 방문해보는 것이 좋다. 의뢰인이 현장에 자주 방문하면 일하는 사람들이 부담스러워할 수도 있기 때문에 아무도 없는 저녁시간에 방문하는 것을 추천한다. 그날그날 진행사항들을 체크하면서 계약 내용과 다르게 시공된 것이 있거나 수정 또는 보완 사항이 있을 경우 업체대표(또는 현장담당자)에게 바로 이야기하는 것이 좋다. 나중에는 공사 순서와 일정 또는 물리적인 상황 때문에 수정사항을 반영해주지 못하는 경우도 있기 때문에 미루지 말고 그때그때 바로 말하고 의견을 조율하는 것이 좋다.\n세금계산서(또는 부가세 영수증)를 발급받아야 할까?\n인테리어(집 수리)를 할 때 규모가 크지 않은 동네 업체에게 견적을 받을 때 부가세 10%를 내고 영수증을 발급받을지, 아니면 영수증을 발급받지 않고 부가세 10%를 절약할지 선택하라고 할 때가 있다.\n나중에 해당 주택을 매도할 때 양도소득세가 비과세라면 굳이 부가세를 끊을 필요가 없다. 그러나 다주택자이거나 혹은 향후 양도가액이 12억 원 초과로 양도소득세 부과가 예상될 경우 부가세 10%를 지급하고 영수증을 발급받아 놓는 것이 좋다.\n양도소득세 계산 시 필요경비로 공사비를 인정받을 수 있어서 절세를 할 수 있기 때문이다. 단, 부가세 영수증을 발급받을 때는 품목을 양도소득세에서 필요경비로 인정받을 수 있는 공사품목으로 발급받아야 한다.\n\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 윤여진",
