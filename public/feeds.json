        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are thrilled to announce that Proxy 3, our latest and greatest solution for polymorphism in C++, is now feature complete! Since the library was initially open-sourced, we have heard much positive feedback and received many brilliant feature requests. Big thanks to all of you who have contributed any code or idea that made the library better!\nOur Mission\n“Proxy” is a modern C++ library that helps you use polymorphism (a way to use different types of objects interchangeably) without needing inheritance.\n“Proxy” was created by Microsoft engineers and has been used in the Windows operating system since 2022. For many years, using inheritance was the main way to achieve polymorphism in C++. However, new programming languages like Rust offer better ways to do this. We have improved our understanding of object-oriented programming and decided to use pointers in C++ as the foundation for “Proxy”. Specifically, the “Proxy” library is designed to be:\nPortable: “Proxy” was implemented as a single-header library in standard C++20. It can be used on any platform while the compiler supports C++20. The majority of the library is freestanding, making it feasible for embedded engineering or kernel design of an operating system.\nNon-intrusive: An implementation type is no longer required to inherit from an abstract binding.\nWell-managed: “Proxy” provides a GC-like capability that manages the lifetimes of different objects efficiently without the need for an actual garbage collector.\nFast: With typical compiler optimizations, “Proxy” produces high-quality code that is as good as or better than hand-written code. In many cases, “Proxy” performs better than traditional inheritance-based approaches, especially in managing the lifetimes of objects.\nAccessible: Learned from user feedback, accessibility has been significantly improved in “Proxy 3” with intuitive syntax, good IDE compatibility, and accurate diagnostics.\nFlexible: Not only member functions, the “abstraction” of “Proxy” allows any expression to be polymorphic, including free functions, operators, conversions, etc. Different abstractions can be freely composed on demand. Performance tuning is supported for experts to balance between extensibility and performance.\nThe New Look\nComparing to our previous releases, there are some major improvements in the syntax and utilities. Let’s get started with some examples!\nHello World\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\n#include \"proxy.h\"\r\n\r\nstruct Streamable : pro::facade_builder\r\n    ::add_convention<pro::operator_dispatch<\"<<\", true>, std::ostream&(std::ostream& out) const>\r\n    ::build {};\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  std::string str = \"Hello World\";\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p1 = &str;\r\n  std::cout << \"p1 = \" << *p1 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p1 = Hello World\"\r\n\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p2 = std::make_unique<int>(123);\r\n  std::cout << \"p2 = \" << *p2 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p2 = 123\"\r\n\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p3 = pro::make_proxy<Streamable>(3.14);\r\n  std::cout << \"p3 = \" << *p3 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p3 = 3.14\"\r\n}\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n#include <iostream>: For std::cout.\n#include <string>: For std::string.\n#include \"proxy.h\": For the “Proxy” library. Most of the facilities of the library are defined in namespace pro. If the library is consumed via vcpkg or conan, this line should be changed into #include <proxy/proxy.h>.\nstruct Streamable : pro::facade_builder ... ::build {}: Defines a facade type Streamable. The term “facade” is how the “Proxy” library models runtime abstraction. Specifically,\n\npro::facade_builder: Provides capability to build a facade type at compile-time.\nadd_convention: Adds a generalized “calling convention”, defined by a “dispatch” and several “overloads”, to the build context.\npro::operator_dispatch<\"<<\", true>: Specifies a dispatch for operator << expressions where the primary operand (proxy) is on the right-hand side (specified by the second template parameter true). Note that polymorphism in the “Proxy” library is defined by expressions rather than member functions, which is different from C++ virtual functions or other OOP languages.\nstd::ostream&(std::ostream& out) const: The signature of the calling convention, similar with std::move_only_function. const specifies that the primary operand is const.\nbuild: Builds the context into a facade type.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p1 = &str: Creates a proxy object from a raw pointer of std::string. p1 behaves like a raw pointer, and does not have ownership of the underlying std::string. If the lifetime of str ends before p1, p1 becomes dangling.\nstd::cout << *p1: This is how it works. It prints “Hello World” because the calling convention is defined in the facade Streamable, so it works as if by calling std::cout << str.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p2 =std::make_unique<int>(123): Creates a std::unique_ptr<int> and converts to a proxy. Different from p1, p2 has ownership of the underlying int because it is instantiated from a value of std::unique_ptr, and will call the destructor of std::unique_ptr when p2 is destroyed, while p1 does not have ownership of the underlying int because it is instantiated from a raw pointer. p1 and p2 are of the same type pro::proxy<Streamable>, which means you can have a function that returns pro::proxy<Streamable> without exposing any information about the implementation details to its caller.\nstd::cout << *p2: Prints “123” with no surprise.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p3 = pro::make_proxy<Streamable>(3.14): Creates a proxy from a double without specifying the underlying pointer type. Specifically,\n\nSimilar with p2, p3 also has ownership of the underlying double value, but can effectively avoid heap allocation.\nSince the size of the underlying type (double) is known to be small (on major 32- or 64-bit platforms), pro::make_proxy realizes the fact at compile-time and guarantees no heap allocation.\nLibrary “Proxy” explicitly defines when heap allocation occurs or not to avoid users falling into performance hell, which is different from std::function and other existing polymorphic wrappers in the standard.\nstd::cout << *p3: Prints “3.14” with no surprise.\nWhen main returns, p2 and p3 will destroy the underlying objects, while p1 does nothing because it holds a raw pointer that does not have ownership of the underlying std::string.\nMore Expressions\nIn addition to the operator expressions demonstrated in the previous example, the library supports almost all forms of expressions in C++ and can make them polymorphic. Specifically,\nThe PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH macro: Defines a dispatch type for member function call expressions.\nThe PRO_DEF_FREE_DISPATCH macro: Defines a dispatch type for free function call expressions.\nThe pro::operator_dispatch class template: Dispatch type for operator expressions.\nThe pro::conversion_dispatch class template: Dispatch type for conversion expressions.\nNote that some facilities are provided as macros, because C++ templates today do not support generating a function with an arbitrary name. Here is another example that makes member function call expressions polymorphic:\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <sstream>\r\n\r\n#include \"proxy.h\"\r\n\r\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemDraw, Draw);\r\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemArea, Area);\r\n\r\nstruct Drawable : pro::facade_builder\r\n    ::add_convention<MemDraw, void(std::ostream& output)>\r\n    ::add_convention<MemArea, double() noexcept>\r\n    ::support_copy<pro::constraint_level::nontrivial>\r\n    ::build {};\r\n\r\nclass Rectangle {\r\n public:\r\n  Rectangle(double width, double height) : width_(width), height_(height) {}\r\n  Rectangle(const Rectangle&) = default;\r\n\r\n  void Draw(std::ostream& out) const {\r\n    out << \"{Rectangle: width = \" << width_ << \", height = \" << height_ << \"}\";\r\n  }\r\n  double Area() const noexcept { return width_ * height_; }\r\n\r\n private:\r\n  double width_;\r\n  double height_;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstd::string PrintDrawableToString(pro::proxy<Drawable> p) {\r\n  std::stringstream result;\r\n  result << \"entity = \";\r\n  p->Draw(result);\r\n  result << \", area = \" << p->Area();\r\n  return std::move(result).str();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  pro::proxy<Drawable> p = pro::make_proxy<Drawable, Rectangle>(3, 5);\r\n  std::string str = PrintDrawableToString(p);\r\n  std::cout << str << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"entity = {Rectangle: width = 3, height = 5}, area = 15\"\r\n}\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n#include <iostream>: For std::cout.\n#include <sstream>: For std::stringstream.\n#include \"proxy.h\": For the “Proxy” library.\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemDraw, Draw): Defines a dispatch type MemDraw for expressions of calling member function Draw.\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemArea, Area): Defines a dispatch type MemArea for expressions of calling member function Area.\nstruct Drawable : pro::facade_builder ... ::build {}: Defines a facade type Drawable. Specifically,\n\nadd_convention: Adds calling conventions to the build context.\nsupport_copy<pro::constraint_level::nontrivial>: Specifies the underlying pointer type shall be copyable, which also makes the resulting proxy type copyable.\nclass Rectangle: An implementation of Drawable.\nFunction PrintDrawableToString: Converts a Drawable into a std::string. Note that this is a function rather than a function template, which means it can generate ABI in a larger build system.\npro::proxy<Drawable> p = pro::make_proxy<Drawable, Rectangle>(3, 5): Creates a proxy<Drawable> object containing a Rectangle.\nstd::string str = PrintDrawableToString(p): Converts p into a std::string, implicitly creates a copy of p.\nstd::cout << str: Prints the string.\nOther Useful Features\nIn addition to the features mentioned above, here is a curated list of the most popular features based on user feedback:\nOverloading: facade_builder::add_convention is more powerful than demonstrated above. It can take any number of overload types and perform standard overload resolution when invoking a proxy.\nFacade composition: facade_builder::add_facade allows flexible composition of different abstractions.\nWeak dispatch: When an object does not implement a convention, and we do not want it to trigger a hard compile error, it is allowed to define a “weak dispatch” with macro PRO_DEF_WEAK_DISPATCH from an existing dispatch type and a default implementation.\nAllocator awareness: Function template allocate_proxy is able to create a proxy from a value with any custom allocator. In C++11, std::function and std::packaged_task had constructors that accepted custom allocators for performance tuning, but these were removed in C++17 because “the semantics are unclear, and there are technical issues with storing an allocator in a type-erased context and then recovering that allocator later for any allocations needed during copy assignment”. These issues do not apply to allocate_proxy.\nConfigurable constraints: facade_builder provides full support for constraints configuration, including memory layout (by restrict_layout), copyability (by support_copy), relocatability (by support_relocation), and destructibility (by support_destruction).\nReflection: proxy supports type-based compile-time reflection for runtime queries, specifically with facade_builder::add_reflection and function template proxy_reflect.\nSummary\nWe hope this library could empower more C++ users outside Microsoft to write polymorphic code easier. The full documentation of Proxy 3 will be published soon. Please stay tuned for more technical details. We are also actively working on several ISO C++ proposals for further standardization.\nThe post Announcing the Proxy 3 Library for Dynamic Polymorphism appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By Jiangwei Pan, Gary Tang, Henry Wang, and Justin Basilico\nIntroduction\nOur mission at Netflix is to entertain the world. Our personalization algorithms play a crucial role in delivering on this mission for all members by recommending the right shows, movies, and games at the right time. This goal extends beyond immediate engagement; we aim to create an experience that brings lasting enjoyment to our members. Traditional recommender systems often optimize for short-term metrics like clicks or engagement, which may not fully capture long-term satisfaction. We strive to recommend content that not only engages members in the moment but also enhances their long-term satisfaction, which increases the value they get from Netflix, and thus they’ll be more likely to continue to be a member.\nRecommendations as Contextual Bandit\nOne simple way we can view recommendations is as a contextual bandit problem. When a member visits, that becomes a context for our system and it selects an action of what recommendations to show, and then the member provides various types of feedback. These feedback signals can be immediate (skips, plays, thumbs up/down, or adding items to their playlist) or delayed (completing a show or renewing their subscription). We can define reward functions to reflect the quality of the recommendations from these feedback signals and then train a contextual bandit policy on historical data to maximize the expected reward.\n\nImproving Recommendations: Models and Objectives\nThere are many ways that a recommendation model can be improved. They may come from more informative input features, more data, different architectures, more parameters, and so forth. In this post, we focus on a less-discussed aspect about improving the recommender objective by defining a reward function that tries to better reflect long-term member satisfaction.\nRetention as Reward?\nMember retention might seem like an obvious reward for optimizing long-term satisfaction because members should stay if they’re satisfied, however it has several drawbacks:\n\nNoisy: Retention can be influenced by numerous external factors, such as seasonal trends, marketing campaigns, or personal circumstances unrelated to the service.\nLow Sensitivity: Retention is only sensitive for members on the verge of canceling their subscription, not capturing the full spectrum of member satisfaction.\nHard to Attribute: Members might cancel only after a series of bad recommendations.\nSlow to Measure: We only get one signal per account per month.\n\nDue to these challenges, optimizing for retention alone is impractical.\nProxy Rewards\nInstead, we can train our bandit policy to optimize a proxy reward function that is highly aligned with long-term member satisfaction while being sensitive to individual recommendations. The proxy reward r(user, item) is a function of user interaction with the recommended item. For example, if we recommend “One Piece” and a member plays then subsequently completes and gives it a thumbs-up, a simple proxy reward might be defined as r(user, item) = f(play, complete, thumb).\n\nClick-through rate (CTR)\nClick-through rate (CTR), or in our case play-through rate, can be viewed as a simple proxy reward where r(user, item) = 1 if the user clicks a recommendation and 0 otherwise. CTR is a common feedback signal that generally reflects user preference expectations. It is a simple yet strong baseline for many recommendation applications. In some cases, such as ads personalization where the click is the target action, CTR may even be a reasonable reward for production models. However, in most cases, over-optimizing CTR can lead to promoting clickbaity items, which may harm long-term satisfaction.\nBeyond CTR\nTo align the proxy reward function more closely with long-term satisfaction, we need to look beyond simple interactions, consider all types of user actions, and understand their true implications on user satisfaction.\nWe give a few examples in the Netflix context:\n\nFast season completion ✅: Completing a season of a recommended TV show in one day is a strong sign of enjoyment and long-term satisfaction.\nThumbs-down after completion ❌: Completing a TV show in several weeks followed by a thumbs-down indicates low satisfaction despite significant time spent.\nPlaying a movie for just 10 minutes ❓: In this case, the user’s satisfaction is ambiguous. The brief engagement might indicate that the user decided to abandon the movie, or it could simply mean the user was interrupted and plans to finish the movie later, perhaps the next day.\nDiscovering new genres ✅ ✅: Watching more Korean or game shows after “Squid Game” suggests the user is discovering something new. This discovery was likely even more valuable since it led to a variety of engagements in a new area for a member.\n\nReward Engineering\nReward engineering is the iterative process of refining the proxy reward function to align with long-term member satisfaction. It is similar to feature engineering, except that it can be derived from data that isn’t available at serving time. Reward engineering involves four stages: hypothesis formation, defining a new proxy reward, training a new bandit policy, and A/B testing. Below is a simple example.\n\nChallenge: Delayed Feedback\nUser feedback used in the proxy reward function is often delayed or missing. For example, a member may decide to play a recommended show for just a few minutes on the first day and take several weeks to fully complete the show. This completion feedback is therefore delayed. Additionally, some user feedback may never occur; while we may wish otherwise, not all members provide a thumbs-up or thumbs-down after completing a show, leaving us uncertain about their level of enjoyment.\n\nWe could try and wait to give a longer window to observe feedback, but how long should we wait for delayed feedback before computing the proxy rewards? If we wait too long (e.g., weeks), we miss the opportunity to update the bandit policy with the latest data. In a highly dynamic environment like Netflix, a stale bandit policy can degrade the user experience and be particularly bad at recommending newer items.\nSolution: predict missing feedback\nWe aim to update the bandit policy shortly after making a recommendation while also defining the proxy reward function based on all user feedback, including delayed feedback. Since delayed feedback has not been observed at the time of policy training, we can predict it. This prediction occurs for each training example with delayed feedback, using already observed feedback and other relevant information up to the training time as input features. Thus, the prediction also gets better as time progresses.\n\nThe proxy reward is then calculated for each training example using both observed and predicted feedback. These training examples are used to update the bandit policy.\nBut aren’t we still only relying on observed feedback in the proxy reward function? Yes, because delayed feedback is predicted based on observed feedback. However, it is simpler to reason about rewards using all feedback directly. For instance, the delayed thumbs-up prediction model may be a complex neural network that takes into account all observed feedback (e.g., short-term play patterns). It’s more straightforward to define the proxy reward as a simple function of the thumbs-up feedback rather than a complex function of short-term interaction patterns. It can also be used to adjust for potential biases in how feedback is provided.\nThe reward engineering diagram is updated with an optional delayed feedback prediction step.\n\nTwo types of ML models\nIt’s worth noting that this approach employs two types of ML models:\n\nDelayed Feedback Prediction Models: These models predict p(final feedback | observed feedbacks). The predictions are used to define and compute proxy rewards for bandit policy training examples. As a result, these models are used offline during the bandit policy training.\nBandit Policy Models: These models are used in the bandit policy π(item | user; r) to generate recommendations online and in real-time.\n\nChallenge: Online-Offline Metric Disparity\nImproved input features or neural network architectures often lead to better offline model metrics (e.g., AUC for classification models). However, when these improved models are subjected to A/B testing, we often observe flat or even negative online metrics, which can quantify long-term member satisfaction.\nThis online-offline metric disparity usually occurs when the proxy reward used in the recommendation policy is not fully aligned with long-term member satisfaction. In such cases, a model may achieve higher proxy rewards (offline metrics) but result in worse long-term member satisfaction (online metrics).\nNevertheless, the model improvement is genuine. One approach to resolve this is to further refine the proxy reward definition to align better with the improved model. When this tuning results in positive online metrics, the model improvement can be effectively productized. See [1] for more discussions on this challenge.\nSummary and Open Questions\nIn this post, we provided an overview of our reward engineering efforts to align Netflix recommendations with long-term member satisfaction. While retention remains our north star, it is not easy to optimize directly. Therefore, our efforts focus on defining a proxy reward that is aligned with long-term satisfaction and sensitive to individual recommendations. Finally, we discussed the unique challenge of delayed user feedback at Netflix and proposed an approach that has proven effective for us. Refer to [2] for an earlier overview of the reward innovation efforts at Netflix.\nAs we continue to improve our recommendations, several open questions remain:\n\nCan we learn a good proxy reward function automatically by correlating behavior with retention?\nHow long should we wait for delayed feedback before using its predicted value in policy training?\nHow can we leverage Reinforcement Learning to further align the policy with long-term satisfaction?\n\nReferences\n[1] Deep learning for recommender systems: A Netflix case study.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The release of Java 23 is around the corner, September 17, 2024, to be precise.\nWhat’s new in this Java version and why should you care about it? If you want to know more than just the syntax of these new features –  the bigger picture, behind the scenes stories, and real life experiences of experts – then this is what JEP Explained is all about!\n‘JEP Explained’ is a series of interviews with Java leaders and experts that are closely involved with creating the new Java features and can help you use them.\nThe intent of these interviews with leaders and experts is to help developers, organizations, and anyone interested understand the new Java features beyond just their syntax.\nInterviews published till date\nWe have published a couple of interviews in this series till date. Here’s the list of the published interviews, with a link to the interview recording and quick details about each episode.\nJEP Explained. JEP 455: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch\nIn this episode, we were privileged to interview Brian Goetz, Java language Architect with Oracle, Aggelos Biboudis, Principal Member Technical Staff, Oracle, and Tagir Valeev, Java Team Technical Lead, JetBrains on JEP 455.\n\nFind out the bigger picture of why primitive data types are being added to the Java language and the finer details of the changes they propose, while also getting a quick demo on how to use them in your codebase.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where all these experts try their luck with tongue twisters, clarify whether some statements are a myth or a fact, and the super fun section when they respond to statements by enacting emojis.\n JEP Explained. JEP 482: Flexible Constructor Bodies\nThis episode of “JEP Explained” covers JEP 482, about proposed changes to constructors that relaxing rules to make them more flexible. With this proposed change, you can execute statements before calling super() or this() in a constructor and initialize members of a derived class before calling a parent constructor.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, a prize winning author, long time professor, Java Champion, and organizer of the Dev2Next conference in Denver.\nIn this interview, Dr. Venkat talks about and demos the issues in your codebase without this change and the benefits of this feature.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Dr. Venkat tries his luck with tongue twisters, clarifies whether some statements are fact or fiction, and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP 477: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods\nThis episode of “JEP Explained” covers JEP 477, which deals with implicitly declared classes and instance main methods.\n\nThe goal of this JEP is to simplify getting started with Java for new Java developers. It does so by introducing simple yet significant changes, like changing the signature of the ‘main’ method from ‘public static void main(String[])’ to ‘void main()’, changing the need to use ‘System.out.println()’ to using ‘println()’, and much more.\nIn this episode, I interviewed Ken Fogel, Department Chairperson Program Coordinator of the Computer Science Technology Program at Dawson College,\nIn this interview, Ken talks about the relevance of these changes for new Java developers and how it will help those teaching “Java 101” to focus on the concepts that benefit beginners the most. Ken also talks about how the new feature can help students to stay focused on building strong computing and logic-building foundations and be introduced to new concepts in an incremental manner.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Ken tries his luck with tongue twisters (he aced it), and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP 466: Class-File API\nThis episode of JEP Explained focuses on JEP 466, which covers the Class-File API, which is designed for parsing, generating, and transforming Java class files.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed Rafael Winterhalter, a Java Champion, consultant, blogger, conference speaker, and author of Byte Buddy – a Runtime code generator for the Java virtual machine.\nIn the interview, Rafael talks about the relevance of the Class-File API; which applications, frameworks, or libraries would use it; and how the developers have been parsing, generating, and transforming source code files until now. He covers the different kinds of transformations that are available and how Byte Buddy, a file transformation tool he authored, works.\nRafael also talked about the benefits and drawbacks of the Class-File API, drawing on his hands-on experience with Byte Buddy.\nDon’t miss the fun sections at the end, where Rafael tries his luck with tongue twisters (he aced it) and the section when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nJEP Explained. JEP480: Structured Concurrency\nThis episode of JEP Explained focuses on JEP 480, which covers structured concurrency and introduces an API for this new feature. You can find more information on structured concurrency and virtual threads here.\n\nIn this episode, I interviewed José Paumard, Java Champion, author, speaker, developer advocate, oracle, former university professor, JUG leader, conference organizer, JavaOne Rockstar, and presenter of the JEP Cafe series on Java’s YouTube channel.\nJosé started the interview by discussing who this JEP is for and the benefits and shortcomings of structured concurrency. He then went on to highlight the essence of structured concurrency – how it makes it easy to debug, test, and observe concurrent applications. He also demonstrated structured concurrency using hands-on examples.\nDon’t miss the fun segments at the end, where José tries his luck with tongue twisters, and the part when he responds to statements by enacting emojis.\nIn the last section, José mentioned a couple of unconferences. Here are the links to them if you are interested:\nJalapeño, Mexico\nJChateau, France\n JAlbas, Scotland\nJCrete, Greece\nInterviews in pipeline\nWe are planning, recording or editing more JEP Explained interviews and we’ll publish them soon. You can expect to view interviews on the following listed JEPs:\nJEP 467: Markdown Documentation Comments\nSummary\nWith JEP Explained Interview series, we hope to help you not just understand and use new Java features, but also know about their stories, their relevance and importance. We want you to understand Java features beyond their syntax by bringing to you insights from JEP owners and authors, or leaders and experts with hands-on experience.\nHappy watching and learning!",

To address these pain points, in Visual Studio 17.11 we’ve introduced a new feature that allows you to refine your completions by adding extra context or asking clarifying questions. Now, you can move directly into Inline Chat and view the suggested code in a more accessible way, without having to accept and modify everything in the editor.\nRefining GitHub Copilot Completions with Inline Chat\n\nYou now have more control over the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot. Instead of merely accepting or ignoring a suggestion, you can now modify and retry! This feature allows you to fine-tune the suggestions given by GitHub Copilot, by adding context or tweaking the suggestion.\n\nPromoting Inline Chat to the Chat Window for More Context\nPreserve the history of your Inline Chat by promoting it to the Chat Window. This feature enables you to maintain a record of the conversation and continue the Chat Window at your convenience on a larger screen. To do this, simply select ‘Continue in chat window…’.\n\nWe’ve adjusted the length of responses from Copilot to ensure they are easily accessible and readable in Inline Chat. When you want to learn more or expand, you can switch to the Chat Window for a larger screen real estate. This will easily enable you to refer back to things later and chat outside of the context of your file.\nUnderstand your symbols right from your editor\nGitHub Copilot can now help you understanding descriptions of various symbols at different invocations within their codebase right from your editor. and select Generate Copilot summary to get provide AI-generated summaries of the selection. This is available for both C# and C++ developers.\n\nLeveraging LLMs, GitHub Copilot enhances existing or lacking code documentation by providing insightful explanations and context within hover tooltips.\n(Coming Soon) Fix code with GitHub Copilot\nNow integrated into the lightbulb and error list, GitHub Copilot provides fixes and explanations for code issues in both C# and C++ development. This feature helps developers understand and resolve various code issues within their codebase. By invoking the lightbulb and selecting Fix with Copilot, GitHub Copilot will open inline chat with an explanation and available fix. Additionally, selecting the Copilot icon from the error list will take you to the chat panel with an explanation and available fix.\n\nLeveraging LLMs, GitHub Copilot enhances code fixes by providing insightful explanations and solutions directly within the lightbulb and error list.\nThese changes make it easier to refer back to previous conversations and continue discussions outside of your file. We hope this new feature enhances your experience with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio. As always, we value your feedback and look forward to hearing your thoughts. Please use the thumbs up and down in chat to provide feedback.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this update to Visual Studio and all the new developments happening within GitHub Copilot, and we look forward to hearing what you think. You can share feedback with us by using the thumbs up or down within the Chat, via Developer Community, by reporting issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn and on Microsoft Learn.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nThe post Incorporate GitHub Copilot into your daily flow appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The current cyber security climate demands that applications not only provide outstanding features but also prioritize the security of user data. Applications like Visual Studio rely on token-based authentication to access resources on your behalf. While effective, token-based authentication can be susceptible to attacks if not properly protected. Today, we are happy to announce that starting with the Visual Studio 17.11 update, we are helping better protect your credentials by making the Windows authentication broker, also known as WAM (Web Access Manager), the default authentication method for Visual Studio 2022.\nDownload Visual Studio 17.11\n\n\nBenefits of Using WAM\nEnhanced Security\nOne of the most significant advantages of WAM is the enhanced security it offers you. By supporting conditional access policies that create a cryptographically secure tie between the token and your device, WAM helps mitigate common vulnerabilities associated with token-based authentication. In addition, WAM can leverage rich OS capabilities such as Windows Hello & FIDO (Fast ID Online) keys to streamline your experience while helping ensure your credentials are better protected against bad actors.\nSimplified User Experience\nBeyond enhancing your security, WAM seamlessly integrates with the Windows account infrastructure, helping to provide you with a consistent and reliable authentication experience across your applications.\nThis integration helps reduce the overall number of authentications prompts you see inside Visual Studio and allows you to leverage your accounts without having to remember and constantly re-enter your credentials.\nGetting started with WAM\nTo begin leveraging the benefits of WAM, ensure that your Visual Studio is updated to version 17.11 or later. Once updated, WAM will be enabled by default, and you can start experiencing the enhanced security and productivity it offers.\nYou can validate that WAM is enabled by opening the Accounts settings under Tools > Options:\n\nCheck our docs for additional details regarding using WAM inside Visual Studio 2022.\nLet us know about your experience\nWe continue to prioritize the security and usability of Visual Studio and are committed to providing the tools and resources you need to build secure, high-performing applications.\nWe look forward to sharing more about what’s next for security. In the meantime, we hope that you enjoy the new WAM authentication experience in Visual Studio and that it makes your development workflow more productive.\nIf you experience any issues or have feedback, please let us know by using the Report a Problem tool in Visual Studio or by posting on the Developer Community or in the comments below. We value your input, and we are always working to improve Visual Studio based on your needs and suggestions.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nThe post Enhancing your Visual Studio authentication experience appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

To try these new features, download the update, make sure to activate your GitHub Copilot account and check out the release notes for more detailed information.\nGitHub Copilot is getting smarter\nGitHub Copilot Chat now enables you to reference your complete solution, which allows you to gain an even deeper, holistic understanding of your solution to get better results! To reference your solution, simply use @workspace, and Copilot will respond to high-level questions regarding your solution, files, and their interactions.\n\nAdditionally, GitHub Copilot Enterprise users in Visual Studio can now use @GitHub to get answers enriched with context from their entire repository and Bing search results.\n\nNaming things made easy\nGitHub Copilot can now generate naming suggestions for your C++ identifiers (variables, methods, or classes) based on how your identifier is being used and the style of your code.\n\nTo try it out, you’ll need an active GitHub Copilot subscription. Navigate to any variable you wish to rename, right-click -> Rename (Keyboard: Ctrl+R, Ctrl+R). You’ll notice a GitHub Copilot sparkle icon that you can click or toggle to generate naming suggestions.\nAI-generated breakpoint expressions\nAI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints are now supported in C++. GitHub Copilot analyzes your code and offers insightful breakpoint expressions, streamlining your debugging process.\n\nWhen you place the cursor in the condition text for a conditional breakpoint/tracepoint in the breakpoint settings window, GitHub Copilot will instantly generate AI-based expression suggestions tailored to your code. You can choose the condition that best suits your needs.\nUnderstand your symbols with GitHub Copilot\nWe’ve integrated GitHub Copilot into the tooltip on hover over symbols to provide AI-generated summaries of the selected symbol. This is available for both C# and C++ developers.\n\nThis feature assists developers in understanding descriptions of various symbols at different invocations within their codebase. By hovering over a symbol and selecting the ‘Tell me more’ option, GitHub Copilot can generate documentation for the selected symbol.\nRefine your GitHub Copilot suggestions\nIn Visual Studio 17.11, you can now refine code completions by adding context or asking questions without accepting them first. This update allows you to modify and retry GitHub Copilot’s suggestions before having to accept, saving you the hassle to accepting and refining again! Just press Alt+/ to modify, or if you’re happy with the suggestion, press tab to accept.\n\nGitHub Copilot is even more secure\nIntroducing GitHub Copilot Content Exclusion, a new feature that allows admins to Copilot to ignore specific files in a repository or organization, ensuring sensitive information is protected while using AI for efficient coding. This applies to Completions, Inline, Chat, for GitHub Copilot for Business and Enterprise users. Additionally, exclusions also apply to other non-chat features, like rename suggestions and hover text. Additionally, content exclusion works with repos on platforms other than GitHub, including Azure DevOps.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this update to Visual Studio and all the new developments happening within GitHub Copilot, and we look forward to hearing what you think. You can share feedback with us by using the thumbs up or down within the Chat, via Developer Community, by reporting issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn and on Microsoft Learn.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nDownload Visual Studio 17.11\n\nThe post New GitHub Copilot features in Visual Studio 2022 17.11 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

UCM은 계량 경제학 등 분야에서 사용되고 있다. \n\n\nUCM 모델에서 시계열 데이터는 트랜드(trend), 계절성(seasonality), 사이클(cycle), 불규칙성(irregular component) 등 구성요소로 분해될 수 있다.\n\n\n트렌드(Trend) 컴포넌트: 장기적인 상승 또는 하강 경향을 나타내는 요소이다. 예를 들어, 경제 성장으로 인한 판매 증가와 같은 장기적인 패턴을 설명할 수 있다.\n계절성(Seasonality) 컴포넌트: 주기적으로 반복되는 패턴을 설명하는 요소이다. 예를 들어, 계절에 따른 기후 변화로 인해 매년 여름에 증가하는 에어컨 판매량이 이에 해당한다.\n사이클(Cycle) 컴포넌트: 계절성보다 더 길고 불규칙한 주기를 나타내는 요소이다. 주로 경제적 사이클(경기 순환)과 같이 장기적인 변동성을 설명할 때 사용된다.\n불규칙성(Irregular) 컴포넌트: 예측할 수 없는 무작위적인 변동 요소로, 모델로 설명할 수 없는 데이터를 설명한다.\n\nUCM은 다양한 분야 시계열 데이터 분석 및 예측에 사용된다. \n\n\n이제 UCM 모델을 사용한 시계열 데이터 처리 프로세스를 확인해 보자. \n\n\nUCM 학습 데이터 처리 프로세스\n데이터 준비\n이 글에서 사용될 데이터셋은 Kaggle의 '시간당 에너지 소비량'이다. 이 소스는 미국 전역 서비스 지역에서 매시간 보고된 에너지값(Mega watts)이 포함되어 있다(예.

Markdown 기반: 옵시디언은 마크다운을 사용하여 포맷팅하며, 이는 가볍고 휴대가능한 텍스트 포맷을 가능하게 합니다.\n2. 로컬 저장소: 모든 노트는 플레인 텍스트 파일로 기기에 로컬로 저장되어 데이터 개인 정보 보호 및 소유권을 보장합니다.\n\n\n\n3. 링크 및 그래프 뷰: 옵시디언은 노트 간의 연결을 생성하는 데 뛰어나며, 아이디어 간의 관계를 볼 수 있는 시각적 그래프 뷰를 제공합니다.\n\n\n\n4. 사용자 정의 가능: 앱은 플러그인과 테마를 지원하여 사용자가 필요에 따라 경험을 맞춤 설정할 수 있습니다.\n5. 크로스 플랫폼: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android에서 사용 가능합니다.\n \n \n  프로그램 장단점\n Obsidian은 사용자의 작업 공간을 최적화하기 위해 다양한 화면 분할 및 고정 기능을 제공합니다. 화면을 무한대로 분할하고 크기를 조절할 수 있어, 여러 노트를 동시에 열어보며 교차 참조를 손쉽게 할 수 있습니다. 특정 노트를 고정하여 해당 내용이 항상 표시되도록 하거나, 서로 다른 노트의 다른 뷰를 보여주는 방식으로 연결할 수도 있습니다. 이러한 기능들은 큰 화면을 사용하는 사용자나, 짧고 핵심적인 노트를 다루는 사용자에게 특히 유용합니다. \n또한, '빠른 전환기' 기능은 키보드만으로도 원하는 노트로 즉시 이동하거나 새 노트를 만들 수 있게 하여, 작업 효율성을 극대화합니다. '명령어 팔레트'를 통해서는 마우스를 사용하지 않고도 모든 기능을 활용할 수 있어, 보다 빠르고 직관적인 작업 흐름을 유지할 수 있습니다. \nObsidian 의 장점과 단점은 다음과 같습니다.\n \n 장점\n1. 강력한 링크 및 지식 관리 기능을 갖추고 있습니다. \n2. 플러그인 및 테마로 고도로 사용자 정의가 가능합니다. \n3. 개인 사용은 무료입니다. \n4. 로컬 저장소는 데이터 개인 정보 보호 및 소유권을 보장합니다. \n5. 빠른 성능과 반응형 인터페이스를 제공합니다.\n 단점\n1. 마크다운에 익숙하지 않은 사람들에게는 배우기가 어렵습니다. \n2. 웹 버전이 없습니다. \n3. 일부 사용자가 매력적이지 않다고 여기는 기본 인터페이스 미학입니다. \n4. 데이터가 로컬에 저장되므로 수동 백업이 필요합니다.\n \n \n \n  라이센스 정책\n Obsidian은 개인 사용에 대해서는 무료로 제공됩니다. 개인적인 노트 작성, 학습, 연구 목적으로 누구나 제한 없이 사용할 수 있습니다. 즉, 개인이 비상업적인 목적으로 노트를 작성하고 관리하는 데 사용하는 경우 별도의 비용을 지불할 필요가 없습니다. \n옵시디언은 아래와 같이 여러 가격 등급을 제공합니다.\n1. 개인 사용: 모든 핵심 기능을 포함하여 무료입니다. \n2. 상업적 사용: 사용자당 연 $50입니다. \n3. 동기화 추가 기능: 기기 간 동기화를 위해 월 $4-$5입니다. \n4. 출판 추가 기능: 웹 출판을 위해 사이트당 월 $8-$10입니다.\n \n \n \n⬇️ 프로그램 다운로드\n \n\n \nObsidian - Sharpen your thinking\nObsidian is the private and flexible note‑taking app that adapts to the way you think.\nobsidian.md",

Ubuntu, Microsoft Korea, NHN Cloud, 안랩 클라우드메이트, GroMetric, WhaTap Labs와 한빛미디어에서 큰 도움을 주셨습니다.**\n무엇보다 서울 시내에서 원활하게 행사를 진행할 수 있도록 올해도 도움을 주신 Microsoft Korea의 공로를 뺴놓을 수 없습니다. ”우분투 리눅스“에서 주최하는 커뮤니티 행사를 위해서 금요일 저녁과 토요일 아침에 지원을 와주신 MS Korea 담당자님에게 다시 한번 감사드립니다. 서울 시내에 위치한 경관좋은 곳에서 이런 큰 행사를 진행할 수 있도록 지원해주신 Microsoft Korea뿐만 아니라 분들에게 감사의 인사를 드립니다. 내년에도 혹은 다음에도 좋은 인연으로 계속할 수 있기를 바랍니다.\n배포\n올해 주제는 ‘배포’입니다. 아마 국내에서 가장 많은 사용자를 가지고 있는 리눅스 배포판은 AL2일 것으로 예상됩니다. 도커와 같은 가상화 도구가 많이 활용되면서 어쩌면 Alpine Linux가 많이 활용될지도 모르겠습니다. 웹서비스를 사용하는 대부분의 팀은 최종 배포에 리눅스 운영체제를 선택하는 경우가 많아지고 있습니다.\n단순히 서비스를 배포한다는 관점에서 벗어나서 “전달” 혹은 “연결”이라는 개념을 포괄해서 구성된 세션으로 구성되었습니다. 개발의 끝단이자, 서비스의 시작이라 할 수 있는 배포라는 개념을 여러 분야의 활용 사례를 보여드릴 수 있도록 노력하였습니다. 리눅스 그 중에서 우분투 리눅스를 활용해서 서비스를 “전달”하고, 이기종 컴퓨터를 “연결”하고, 더 나아가 우리가 만든 소프트웨어를 “배포”하는데 활용할 수 있다는 개념이나 관점이 작게나마 전달되었기를 바랍니다. 올해 행사가 많은 분들에게 리눅스에서 무언가를 전달하는 것에 대한 개념이나 관점에 작은 도움이 되었기를 희망해봅니다.\n마지막으로, 2025년에 다시 뵙겠습니다.",

NHN Cloud에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 도입하여 시스템의 안정성을 높이고, 더 큰 장애 상황으로 이어질 수 있는 문제를 효과적으로 예방할 수 있었습니다. 이번 글에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 적용하며 경험한 내용을 중심으로 아래의 주제에 대해 자세히 소개하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker의 동작 원리\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\n## 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n\r\r\n### 서비스 장애 발생\r\r\n\r\r\n현대의 많은 서비스들은 API(application programming interface)나 RPC(remote procedure call)를 통해 데이터를 주고받습니다. 그런데 만약 특정 서비스가 응답하지 않는다면 어떤 일이 발생할까요? 호출한 서비스는 설정된 타임아웃 시간이 지날 때까지 응답을 기다리게 되고, 이로 인해 다른 서비스에도 **연쇄적인 영향을 미쳐 심각한 장애**로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_01_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j012408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 타임아웃이 왜 서비스 장애로 이어질까?\r\r\n\r\r\n애플리케이션은 작업을 처리하기 위해 스레드를 할당받아 실행합니다. 그러나 스레드 풀은 유한하기 때문에 동시에 처리할 수 있는 작업의 수에도 한계가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_02_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j022408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위 그림에서처럼 서비스 A와 관련된 요청이 증가하면서, 스레드 풀이 점점 더 많은 요청을 처리하게 되고, 결국 모든 스레드를 점유하게 됩니다. 이후 들어오는 요청들은 대기 큐에 쌓이게 되며, 대기 시간 동안 처리되지 못한 요청은 타임아웃이 발생합니다. 즉, 스레드 풀이 가득 찬 상태에서는 새로운 요청을 처리할 수 없어 서비스 장애가 발생하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Circuit Breaker로 문제 해결하기\r\r\n\r\r\n위와 같은 상황에서 Circuit Breaker를 도입하면 문제를 효과적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 서비스 호출의 실패율이 설정된 임곗값을 초과할 경우, 해당 서비스 호출을 즉시 차단하고 오류를 발생시킵니다. 이렇게 하면 A 서비스가 응답하지 않아 스레드 풀의 모든 스레드를 장시간 점유하는 상황을 방지할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 문제 발생 시 즉시 대응하여 시스템 전체에 미치는 영향을 줄이고, 장애가 전파되는 것을 방지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Resilience4j란?\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 소개에 앞서 Resilience4j가 무엇인지 간단하게 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j는 Netflix Hystrix로부터 영감을 받은 **함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)으로 설계된, 경량의 내결함성(fault tolerance) 라이브러리**입니다. Resilience4j는 Circuit Breaker 이외에 다른 핵심 모듈인 Bulkhead, RateLimiter, Retry, TimeLimiter, Cache을 제공하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 현재 Netflix Hystrix는 maintenance 모드이며, Resilience4j 사용을 권장하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker란?\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **CLOSED**, **OPEN** 및 **HALF\\_OPEN**의 세 가지 일반 상태와 **DISABLED** 및 **FORCED\\_OPEN**의 두 가지 특수 상태를 갖는 **유한 상태 머신**입니다.\r\r\n그리고 Circuit Breaker 동작을 이해하기 위해 필요한 `상태`와 `슬라이딩 윈도우`라는 2가지 주요 요소가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 상태(State)\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_03_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j032408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* 일반 상태\r\r\n    * CLOSED: 정상적으로 요청을 처리할 수 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * OPEN: 장애 상황으로 간주하여 이후 모든 요청에 대해 거부하는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * HALF\\_OPEN: 연동된 서비스의 장애 여부를 확인하기 위해 일시적으로 호출을 허용하는 상태이고 결과에 따라 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n* 특수 상태\r\r\n    * DISABLED: Circuit Breaker가 비활성화된 상태입니다. 즉, Circuit Breaker를 적용하지 않았을 때와 동일하게 동작합니다.\r\r\n    * FORCED\\_OPEN: 특정 조건에서 강제로 OPEN 상태로 변경되어 요청에 대해 처리할 수 없는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 슬라이딩 윈도우(Sliding Window)\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우는 시간 기반(Time-Based)과 개수 기반(Count-Based)의 2가지 타입을 갖습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Time-Based: **특정 기간(Duration)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n* Count-Based: **특정 개수(Count)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 동작\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **슬라이딩 윈도우 기반으로 호출(call) 결과를 기록 및 집계하고 그 결과에 따라 상태를 전환**합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기본적으로 CLOSED 상태로 시작되며, 연동된 서비스의 호출 결과를 `성공` 또는 `실패`로 기록합니다.\r\r\n이때, 실패로 기록된 호출 결과의 비율이 설정한 임계치를 초과하게 되면 연동된 서비스를 장애 상태로 판단하여 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이후 Circuit Breaker는 설정에 의해 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환될 수 있습니다. HALF\\_OPEN 상태에서는 일부 요청을 연동된 서비스로 호출하고 그 결과에 따라 CLOSED 또는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j Circuit Breaker의 각 설정 옵션에 대한 정확한 이해를 바탕으로 보다 명확하게 사용자의 의도에 맞게 설정할 수 있습니다. 공식 문서에 명시된 설명과 유의 사항을 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### failureRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < failureRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 50\r\r\nfailureRateThreshold(float failureRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallDurationThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nslowCallDurationThreshold(Duration slowCallDurationThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린 요청의 판단 기준을 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과를 받기까지의 시간이 설정한 값 이상으로 소요될 때 느린 요청으로 결과가 집계됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 호출 결과를 받기까지 소요된 시간을 기준으로 판단합니다. 실패했지만 느린 요청은 요청 횟수뿐 아니라 요청 실패 횟수도 증가합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_04_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j042408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuitBreakerStateMachine 클래스에는 내부적으로 AbstractAggregation을 상속 받은 TotalAggregation 객체를 가지고 있고, 이 객체에서 호출 결과에 따라 그 수를 각각 저장합니다. 위 화면에서 호출 결과가 SLOW\\_SUCCESS, SLOW\\_ERROR일 때 numberOfSlowCalls 카운트를 증가시키고 있습니다. 즉 **호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 느린 요청의 수를 증가**시킵니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < slowCallRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 100\r\r\nslowCallRateThreshold(float slowCallRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린(slow) 요청 비율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n느린 요청 비율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowType\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = COUNT_BASED\r\r\nslidingWindowType(SlidingWindowType slidingWindowType)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우 타입을 설정합니다.\r\r\nCOUNT\\_BASED와 TIME\\_BASED 2가지 타입이 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowSize\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nslidingWindowSize(int slidingWindowSize)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈를 설정합니다. 슬라이딩 윈도우 타입에 따라 설정한 값의 의미가 다릅니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* TIME\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 초(second) 단위이며, 600으로 설정할 경우 600초를 의미합니다.\r\r\n* COUNT\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 개수 단위이며, 100으로 설정할 경우 100개의 요청 수를 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nTime/Count Based 2가지 타입 모두 현재를 기준으로 합니다.\r\r\n즉, Time-Based는 최근 x초 동안의 호출을 기록하고, Count-Based는 최근 x개의 호출 수를 기록합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### minimumNumberOfCalls\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nminimumNumberOfCalls(int minimumNumberOfCalls)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위한 최소 호출 수에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Q. 만약 이 값이 없다면?\r\r\n> 최초 1개의 요청이 실패하면 즉시 실패율이 100%가 되어 Circuit Breaker 상태가 변경될 수 있습니다.\r\r\n> 따라서, 임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위해 최소한의 호출 수가 필요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **유의 사항**\r\r\n\r\r\n이 설정 값의 실제 동작에서의 역할과 유의 사항은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 최소 호출 수에 도달할 때까지 Circuit Breaker는 CLOSED 상태를 유지합니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우에도 이 설정 값은 시간이 아닌 `개수`입니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우 시간이 지나면서 이전 호출 결과가 슬라이딩 윈도우에 포함되지 않을 경우가 있습니다.\r\r\n    * 따라서 슬라이딩 윈도우에 기록 및 집계된 호출 결과의 수가 최소 요청 수를 만족할 때까지 상태를 전환하지 않습니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: 슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈가 30분일 때 14시 30분~15시까지 100개의 요청이 있고 15시부터 요청이 없다면, 15시 30분 기준에서는 단 하나의 요청도 없기 때문에 다시 최소 요청 수에 도달하기 전까지 임계치 초과 여부를 판단할 수 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState에 설정된 값과 minimumNumberOfCalls 값 중 최솟값을 사용**합니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=10, minimumNumberOfCalls=5일 경우, Circuit Breaker는 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 5개의 호출 결과에 대해 임계치를 계산하여 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 10\r\r\npermittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(int permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 허용 가능한 호출 수를 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> minimumNumberOfCalls 유의 사항 4번 참고\r\r\n\r\r\n### waitDurationInOpenState / waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nwaitDurationInOpenState(Duration waitDurationInOpenState)\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState(IntervalFunction waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환하기 위해 필요한 대기 시간을 설정합니다.\r\r\n이 설정 값만큼 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태를 유지해야 함을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState를 사용하면 interval function에 대해 커스터마이징이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 반드시 하나만 설정해야 하고, 모두 설정하면 오류가 발생합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nautomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled(boolean enableAutomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpen)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환 시 자동화 여부에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n만약 true로 설정되었다면, waitDurationInOpenState에서 설정한 시간이 지나면 자동으로 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default : minimumNumberOfCalls 값만큼 호출 후 OPEN 또는 CLOSED 상태로 전환될 때까지 HALF_OPEN 상태 유지 \r\r\nmaxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState(Duration maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 최대 몇 초 동안 유지될지에 대한 값을 설정합니다.\r\r\n설정된 시간이 지나면 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN

NHN Cloud에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 도입하여 시스템의 안정성을 높이고, 더 큰 장애 상황으로 이어질 수 있는 문제를 효과적으로 예방할 수 있었습니다. 이번 글에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 적용하며 경험한 내용을 중심으로 아래의 주제에 대해 자세히 소개하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker의 동작 원리\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\n## 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n\r\r\n### 서비스 장애 발생\r\r\n\r\r\n현대의 많은 서비스들은 API(application programming interface)나 RPC(remote procedure call)를 통해 데이터를 주고받습니다. 그런데 만약 특정 서비스가 응답하지 않는다면 어떤 일이 발생할까요? 호출한 서비스는 설정된 타임아웃 시간이 지날 때까지 응답을 기다리게 되고, 이로 인해 다른 서비스에도 **연쇄적인 영향을 미쳐 심각한 장애**로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_01_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j012408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 타임아웃이 왜 서비스 장애로 이어질까?\r\r\n\r\r\n애플리케이션은 작업을 처리하기 위해 스레드를 할당받아 실행합니다. 그러나 스레드 풀은 유한하기 때문에 동시에 처리할 수 있는 작업의 수에도 한계가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_02_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j022408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위 그림에서처럼 서비스 A와 관련된 요청이 증가하면서, 스레드 풀이 점점 더 많은 요청을 처리하게 되고, 결국 모든 스레드를 점유하게 됩니다. 이후 들어오는 요청들은 대기 큐에 쌓이게 되며, 대기 시간 동안 처리되지 못한 요청은 타임아웃이 발생합니다. 즉, 스레드 풀이 가득 찬 상태에서는 새로운 요청을 처리할 수 없어 서비스 장애가 발생하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Circuit Breaker로 문제 해결하기\r\r\n\r\r\n위와 같은 상황에서 Circuit Breaker를 도입하면 문제를 효과적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 서비스 호출의 실패율이 설정된 임곗값을 초과할 경우, 해당 서비스 호출을 즉시 차단하고 오류를 발생시킵니다. 이렇게 하면 A 서비스가 응답하지 않아 스레드 풀의 모든 스레드를 장시간 점유하는 상황을 방지할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 문제 발생 시 즉시 대응하여 시스템 전체에 미치는 영향을 줄이고, 장애가 전파되는 것을 방지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Resilience4j란?\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 소개에 앞서 Resilience4j가 무엇인지 간단하게 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j는 Netflix Hystrix로부터 영감을 받은 **함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)으로 설계된, 경량의 내결함성(fault tolerance) 라이브러리**입니다. Resilience4j는 Circuit Breaker 이외에 다른 핵심 모듈인 Bulkhead, RateLimiter, Retry, TimeLimiter, Cache을 제공하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 현재 Netflix Hystrix는 maintenance 모드이며, Resilience4j 사용을 권장하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker란?\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **CLOSED**, **OPEN** 및 **HALF\\_OPEN**의 세 가지 일반 상태와 **DISABLED** 및 **FORCED\\_OPEN**의 두 가지 특수 상태를 갖는 **유한 상태 머신**입니다.\r\r\n그리고 Circuit Breaker 동작을 이해하기 위해 필요한 `상태`와 `슬라이딩 윈도우`라는 2가지 주요 요소가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 상태(State)\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_03_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j032408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* 일반 상태\r\r\n    * CLOSED: 정상적으로 요청을 처리할 수 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * OPEN: 장애 상황으로 간주하여 이후 모든 요청에 대해 거부하는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * HALF\\_OPEN: 연동된 서비스의 장애 여부를 확인하기 위해 일시적으로 호출을 허용하는 상태이고 결과에 따라 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n* 특수 상태\r\r\n    * DISABLED: Circuit Breaker가 비활성화된 상태입니다. 즉, Circuit Breaker를 적용하지 않았을 때와 동일하게 동작합니다.\r\r\n    * FORCED\\_OPEN: 특정 조건에서 강제로 OPEN 상태로 변경되어 요청에 대해 처리할 수 없는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 슬라이딩 윈도우(Sliding Window)\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우는 시간 기반(Time-Based)과 개수 기반(Count-Based)의 2가지 타입을 갖습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Time-Based: **특정 기간(Duration)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n* Count-Based: **특정 개수(Count)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 동작\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **슬라이딩 윈도우 기반으로 호출(call) 결과를 기록 및 집계하고 그 결과에 따라 상태를 전환**합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기본적으로 CLOSED 상태로 시작되며, 연동된 서비스의 호출 결과를 `성공` 또는 `실패`로 기록합니다.\r\r\n이때, 실패로 기록된 호출 결과의 비율이 설정한 임계치를 초과하게 되면 연동된 서비스를 장애 상태로 판단하여 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이후 Circuit Breaker는 설정에 의해 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환될 수 있습니다. HALF\\_OPEN 상태에서는 일부 요청을 연동된 서비스로 호출하고 그 결과에 따라 CLOSED 또는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j Circuit Breaker의 각 설정 옵션에 대한 정확한 이해를 바탕으로 보다 명확하게 사용자의 의도에 맞게 설정할 수 있습니다. 공식 문서에 명시된 설명과 유의 사항을 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### failureRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < failureRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 50\r\r\nfailureRateThreshold(float failureRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallDurationThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nslowCallDurationThreshold(Duration slowCallDurationThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린 요청의 판단 기준을 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과를 받기까지의 시간이 설정한 값 이상으로 소요될 때 느린 요청으로 결과가 집계됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 호출 결과를 받기까지 소요된 시간을 기준으로 판단합니다. 실패했지만 느린 요청은 요청 횟수뿐 아니라 요청 실패 횟수도 증가합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_04_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j042408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuitBreakerStateMachine 클래스에는 내부적으로 AbstractAggregation을 상속 받은 TotalAggregation 객체를 가지고 있고, 이 객체에서 호출 결과에 따라 그 수를 각각 저장합니다. 위 화면에서 호출 결과가 SLOW\\_SUCCESS, SLOW\\_ERROR일 때 numberOfSlowCalls 카운트를 증가시키고 있습니다. 즉 **호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 느린 요청의 수를 증가**시킵니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < slowCallRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 100\r\r\nslowCallRateThreshold(float slowCallRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린(slow) 요청 비율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n느린 요청 비율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowType\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = COUNT_BASED\r\r\nslidingWindowType(SlidingWindowType slidingWindowType)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우 타입을 설정합니다.\r\r\nCOUNT\\_BASED와 TIME\\_BASED 2가지 타입이 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowSize\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nslidingWindowSize(int slidingWindowSize)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈를 설정합니다. 슬라이딩 윈도우 타입에 따라 설정한 값의 의미가 다릅니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* TIME\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 초(second) 단위이며, 600으로 설정할 경우 600초를 의미합니다.\r\r\n* COUNT\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 개수 단위이며, 100으로 설정할 경우 100개의 요청 수를 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nTime/Count Based 2가지 타입 모두 현재를 기준으로 합니다.\r\r\n즉, Time-Based는 최근 x초 동안의 호출을 기록하고, Count-Based는 최근 x개의 호출 수를 기록합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### minimumNumberOfCalls\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nminimumNumberOfCalls(int minimumNumberOfCalls)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위한 최소 호출 수에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Q. 만약 이 값이 없다면?\r\r\n> 최초 1개의 요청이 실패하면 즉시 실패율이 100%가 되어 Circuit Breaker 상태가 변경될 수 있습니다.\r\r\n> 따라서, 임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위해 최소한의 호출 수가 필요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **유의 사항**\r\r\n\r\r\n이 설정 값의 실제 동작에서의 역할과 유의 사항은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 최소 호출 수에 도달할 때까지 Circuit Breaker는 CLOSED 상태를 유지합니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우에도 이 설정 값은 시간이 아닌 `개수`입니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우 시간이 지나면서 이전 호출 결과가 슬라이딩 윈도우에 포함되지 않을 경우가 있습니다.\r\r\n    * 따라서 슬라이딩 윈도우에 기록 및 집계된 호출 결과의 수가 최소 요청 수를 만족할 때까지 상태를 전환하지 않습니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: 슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈가 30분일 때 14시 30분~15시까지 100개의 요청이 있고 15시부터 요청이 없다면, 15시 30분 기준에서는 단 하나의 요청도 없기 때문에 다시 최소 요청 수에 도달하기 전까지 임계치 초과 여부를 판단할 수 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState에 설정된 값과 minimumNumberOfCalls 값 중 최솟값을 사용**합니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=10, minimumNumberOfCalls=5일 경우, Circuit Breaker는 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 5개의 호출 결과에 대해 임계치를 계산하여 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 10\r\r\npermittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(int permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 허용 가능한 호출 수를 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> minimumNumberOfCalls 유의 사항 4번 참고\r\r\n\r\r\n### waitDurationInOpenState / waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nwaitDurationInOpenState(Duration waitDurationInOpenState)\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState(IntervalFunction waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환하기 위해 필요한 대기 시간을 설정합니다.\r\r\n이 설정 값만큼 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태를 유지해야 함을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState를 사용하면 interval function에 대해 커스터마이징이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 반드시 하나만 설정해야 하고, 모두 설정하면 오류가 발생합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nautomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled(boolean enableAutomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpen)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환 시 자동화 여부에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n만약 true로 설정되었다면, waitDurationInOpenState에서 설정한 시간이 지나면 자동으로 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default : minimumNumberOfCalls 값만큼 호출 후 OPEN 또는 CLOSED 상태로 전환될 때까지 HALF_OPEN 상태 유지 \r\r\nmaxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState(Duration maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 최대 몇 초 동안 유지될지에 대한 값을 설정합니다.\r\r\n설정된 시간이 지나면 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### writableStackTraceEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nwritableStackTraceEnabled(boolean writableStackTraceEnabled)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n오류 발생 시 stackTrace 출력 여부에 대한 설정 값입니다.\r\r\nfalse로 설정된다면 Exception.getStackTrace() 호출 시 길이가 0인 배열을 반환합니다.\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태일 때 받는 요청은 이미 CLOSED 상태에서 인지한 오류와 동일할 가능성이 크기 때문에 스팸성 로그를 줄이는 데 유용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordException\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordException(Predicate\\ predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n실패로 기록될 오류를 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n조건문에 의해 true가 반환되면 해당 오류는 실패로 기록됩니다. 반대로 오류가 성공으로 간주되어야 하는 경우 false로 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> IgnoreExceptions, ignoreException에 의해 설정된 오류는 제외 가능\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordResult\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordResult(Predicate\\ predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n응답 결과의 성공/실패에 대해 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n오류가 발생하지 않더라도 특정 응답 결과가 실패로 기록되어야 한다면 해당 조건문에 의해 true가 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n###

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이전 글 part 1에서 못 담았던 자신감 관련 이야기를 조금 더 해보고 싶다. 우리가 시작했던 LA 시장에서도 이런 창업가와 VC들의 자신감이 크게 상승했던 큰 이벤트가 있었는데, 바로 Snap(구 Snapchat)의 IPO였다.\n스냅챗은 아주 LA스러운 창업가 Evan Spiegel에 LA의 Venice Beach에서 창업했고, 2017년 3월 2일에 IPO를 했다. 최근 시가총액은 20조 원을 왔다 갔다 하고 있어서 IPO 당시 시총보단 한참 작지만, 높을 땐 40조 원이 넘는, 디즈니와 Amgen에 이어 LA 지역에서 세 번째로 시총이 높은 회사였다. 스냅의 IPO가 LA의 스타트업 생태계에 미친 영향은 엄청났는데, 가장 큰 건 이전 포스팅에서 내가 강조한 ‘자신감’이다. 당시에 LA는 전 세계에서 가장 빠르게 성장하고 있는 벤처생태계 중 하나였고, 그동안 많은 좋은 스타트업이 창업되고 엑싯도 잘했다. 그런데 이 엑싯들을 보면 대부분 수백억 원에서 수천억 원 대의 M&A였고, 아주 가끔은 조 단위의 엑싯도 LA 지역에서 일어나기도 했다. 스냅 IPO 이전에는 대부분의 LA 창업가들은 적당히 회사를 키운 후에 수백억 ~ 수천억 원 규모에 더 큰 회사에 파는 엑싯 전략을 기반으로 사업을 했고, 그 이유는 그 정도의 자신감밖에 없었기 때문이기도 하다.\n하지만, 26살의 젊은 창업가 Evan이 스냅챗을 수십조 원짜리 회사로 상장시켰을 때, LA 지역의 창업가들은 이 IPO로 인해 굉장한 자신감을 갖게 됐다. LA에서 수천억 원 ~ 수조 원의 엑싯은 심심찮게 나왔지만, 수십조 원의 IPO도 가능하다는 걸 스냅이 입증해 줬기 때문에, 더 많은 창업가가 “나도 굳이 실리콘밸리나 다른 곳으로 가지 않아도, 내가 사랑하는 따뜻한 LA에서 잘만 하면 수십조 원짜리 회사를 만들어서 상장시킬 수 있다.”라는 생각을 하면서 엄청난 자신감을 갖게 됐다. 스냅의 IPO 이후엔 더 많은 LA의 창업가가 더 큰 꿈과 비전을 갖고, 이왕 시작한 회사를 가능하면 대형 IPO가 가능한 규모로 키울 생각을 하게 됐는데, 나는 이게 엄청난 긍정적 자신감의 변화라고 생각한다.\n스냅의 성공적인 IPO로 인해서 다양한 변화가 생기기 시작했는데, 가장 눈에 띄는 변화 몇 가지에 대해서 적어보고 싶다. 일단 LA의 북동쪽에 위치한 캘리포니아공대(Caltech) 학생들의 창업이 활발해지기 시작했다. 나는 개인적으로 칼텍 학생들이 전반적으로 MIT나 스탠포드 보다 더 똑똑하다고 생각하는데(smart이기도 하지만, 훨씬 더 geeky하고 nerdy 하다), 이들은 전통적으로 창업보다는 연구에 관심이 많았다. 이 학교 졸업생들은 대부분 석사/박사 과정까지 하고, 이후에는 교수, 또는 NASA나 JPL(제트추진연구소)에 취직해서 인류가 직면한 가장 어려운 문제에 대한 솔루션을 찾는 커리어를 선호한다. 하지만, 스냅 IPO 이후에는 칼텍 학생들도 창업에 관심을 갖게 됐고, 이렇게 좋은 창업가들이 뭔가를 시작한다는 건 LA의 창업 생태계에는 엄청난 긍정적인 변화와 자신감을 가져오는 계기가 됐다.\n또한, 스냅의 IPO로 인해, 굉장히 많은 부자들이 탄생했다. 스냅에 투자한 투자자들이 이 IPO로 번 돈은 엄청났고, 이들은 LA 생태계에 계속 돈을 투입하면 더 많은 성공적인 회사들이 나올 것이고, 더 많은 돈을 벌 수 있다는 확고한 자신감이 생겼다. 또한, 이들에게 자금을 제공해 주는 LP 들도 LA의 스타트업 생태계에 대한 신념이 생기면서 계속 대규모 자본이 LA 스타트업에 투입되는 선순환 사이클이 만들어졌다.\n스냅의 많은 직원들도 이 IPO로 인해서 백만장자가 됐다. 이들은 성공적인 회사를 만들었고, 돈도 벌면서 새로운 레벨의 자신감을 경험하기 시작했다. 이들은 다른 스타트업에 개인 투자를 하거나, 후배 양성을 위한 액셀러레이터나 VC 펀드를 설립해서 본인이 사업하면서 남들한테 받았던 도움을 다시 pay it forward 하기 시작했다. 이런 사이클이 몇 번 반복되면서 LA도 실리콘밸리와 같은 두터운 창업가와 투자자의 인프라가 형성되기 시작했다. 내가 말하는 자신감이 여기저기서 생기기 시작한 것이다. 스냅의 IPO로 큰돈을 못 번 직원들도 작은 회사가 초고속 성장해서 IPO까지 가는 걸 경험했기 때문에, 이러한 경험, 배움, 그리고 자신감을 다른 스타트업으로 그대로 가져가서 스냅과 같은 성공 케이스를 계속 만들기 시작하면서, LA 스타트업 생태계의 자신감이 폭발하기 시작했다. \n나는 이런 현상이 한국에서도 이제 막 일어나고 있다고 생각한다. 그래서 많은 스타트업 분들이 기대하고 있는 토스의 IPO가 초대박이 나길 바라고 있고 마켓컬리 같은 회사도 아주 잘 되길 바란다. 참고로, 우린 토스나 마켓컬리 투자자는 아니다.",

5단계\n.css-14on8x8{font-size:17px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:normal;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);margin:24px 0 8px;}\n이사할 때 인테리어를 고치는 사람이 늘어나고 있다. 지어진 지 10년 이상 된 집에 입주할 때뿐 아니라 새 아파트 입주 시에도 인테리어를 취향껏 하고 싶어서 ‘마이너스 옵션(아파트 분양에 있어서, 벽지, 바닥재 등 마감재 품목의 설치 여부를 입주자가 선택하게 하는 것)’을 이용하거나 기본 인테리어를 뜯어내고 다시 할 정도다.\n잡지에 소개된 집처럼 세련되고 개성 있게 고치고 싶지만, 대부분 인테리어에 대한 경험과 지식이 부족하고 예산이 한정되어 있어 공사 시작 전부터 막막하다. 그래서 초보자도 큰 실수 없이 인테리어를 할 수 있는 방법을 5단계로 정리해 보았다.\n1단계. 공사 범위 및 예산 정하기\n무작정 업체부터 방문해서 인테리어 상담을 받기보다는, .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}나중에 수정하더라도 .css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}‘어느 부분을 어떻게 고칠 것인지’를 미리 계획하고 방문하는 것이 좋다. ‘전체 수리’를 할지 아니면 ‘부분 수리’를 할지 결정한 다음, 원하는 스타일을 생각해보는 것이다.\n먼저 수리할 부분을 항목별로 나눠 리스트를 작성한다. 리스트에는 자신이 생각하는 콘셉트 및 총 예산을 쓰고 나서 항목별 원하는 스타일이나 예상하는 예산을 적는다. 인테리어를 진행하다 보면 처음에 계획한 것보다 비용이 초과되는 경우가 많기 때문에 공사 범위, 콘셉트 및 예산 계획을 미리 세우는 것이 중요하다.\n2단계. 견적받기\n적어도 세 곳 이상의 다른 업체에서 견적을 받아 가격을 비교해 봐야 감을 잡을 수 있다. 다섯 곳이 넘어가면 중복되는 내용이 많고 오히려 결정을 늦출 수 있어 일반적으로 서너 곳 정도에서 받아보는 것이 무난하다.\n견적을 받을 때는 반드시 실제 공사할 현장에 방문해서 실측이 이루어져야 한다. 간혹 해당 아파트 단지 공사 경험이 많다는 이유 등으로 현장 방문을 생략하고 견적을 내려는 업체가 있는데, 이런 업체는 과감하게 패스하는 것이 좋다. 아무리 같은 단지, 같은 구조의 아파트라 하더라도 각각의 집마다 공사 여건과 환경 등이 달라질 수 있기 때문이다. 가격은 유독 저렴한 업체와 비싼 업체는 피하고 중간 정도의 가격대를 꼼꼼히 확인해서 내주는 업체로 하는 것이 좋다.\n3단계. 인테리어 업체 선정하기\n인테리어 업체는 믿을 만한지(공사 경험과 A/S), 의뢰인의 의견을 잘 반영해 주는지 등을 중점적으로 살펴본다. 계약서를 작성하기 전에 지역 맘카페에 글을 올려 해당 인테리어 업체에 대한 평판과 반응, 공사 후기 등을 댓글로 살펴보는 것도 좋다. 단, 인테리어 업체에 대한 질문을 올릴 때에는 상호명을 직접적으로 노출하는 것은 피해야 한다. 의도치 않게 업체에 대한 악플이 달려 민원을 받을 수도 있기 때문이다. 구체적인 동네와 초성 처리한 상호 정도로 올려도 같은 지역 사람들은 어느 업체인지 다 알기 때문에 조언의 댓글을 받을 수 있다.\n또한 업체의 대표가 실제 공사에 어느 정도 관여하는지도 중요하다. 일부 업체에서는 견적 및 전체적인 일정만 관리하고 모든 공사와 감독을 하청업체에 맡기기도 한다. 물론 인테리어 업체의 대표가 모든 공정의 기술자가 아니기 때문에 항목별로 하청을 주는 것은 당연하다. 하지만 현장은 늘 대표나 담당직원이 직접 관리·감독하면서 부분적이라도 공사에 직접 참여하고 있어야 한다. 대표가 현장을 관리·감독하는 업체일수록 공사의 만족도도 높고 A/S도 빠른 편이다.\n4단계. 계약서 작성하기\n계약서를 작성할 때는 각 항목별 ‘세부 내역서’도 포함되어 있어야 한다. 전체 공사금액뿐만 아니라 각 항목별 세부금액과 어떠한 자재로 시공되는지 기재해야 한다.\n가끔 ‘싱크대 상급으로 시공’, ‘전등 LED로 시공’ 등과 같이 두루뭉술하게 내역서를 작성하기도 한다. 고객이 생각한 수준 이상으로 시공이 되는 경우도 있지만 반대로 그 이하의 제품으로 시공이 될 수도 있기 때문에 분쟁의 소지가 다분하다. 그러므로 반드시 계약서 작성 시, 공사 항목별로 세분화하여 꼼꼼하게 작성한 내역서가 첨부되어야 한다.\n예를 들어 ‘욕실공사’라는 항목이 있을 때 단순히 ‘욕실 전체 공사 450만 원’이라고 적으면 안 된다. ‘바닥방수재 시공 60만 원, 타일 시공(벽면 250×400, 바닥 200×200) 190만 원, 변기(대림,모델 No.OO) 40만 원…, 합계 450만 원’과 같이 세부적으로 항목별 금액과 제품의 사이즈 또는 모델 번호까지 기재해야 한다.\n또한 공사 기간, A/S 기간 및 범위, 추가 비용 등의 내용이 반드시 포함되어야 한다. 특히 추가 비용에는 공사 현장 여건상 불가피하게 추가로 발생하는 경우와 의뢰인의 요구사항이나 변경사항으로 인해 추가로 발생하는 경우를 나누어 상황별로 어떻게 비용을 처리할지를 명확하게 기재하는 것이 좋다. 세부 내역서를 포함한 계약서는 2부 작성하여 각각 1부씩 보관하고 있어야 한다.\n계약서를 작성할 때는 너무하다는 생각이 들 정도로 꼼꼼하게 작성하는 것이 좋다. 분쟁의 소지가 그만큼 줄어들기 때문이다.\n✅.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}’인테리어 계약서 잘 쓰는 법' 자세히 보기\n\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0

금액은 참고용이며, 인테리어 공사비는 물가 상승에 따라 꾸준히 오르고 있다.\n5단계. 비용 지급하기\n일반적으로 전체 공사비의 10~20% 정도의 계약금을 계약서 작성 시 지급한다. 중도금은 한 번에 50~60%를 지급하는 경우가 있고, 1차와 2차로 나누어 지급하는 경우도 있다. 한 번에 낼 때는 대개 철거공사가 완료되고 본격적으로 인테리어 공사가 진행될 때 지급한다. 중도금을 나누어 낼 때는 철거공사가 시작될 때와 공사 공정이 중간을 넘기는 시점에 지급하는 경우가 많다.\n잔금 20~30%는 최종적으로 모든 공사가 완료되고 의뢰인이 현장을 점검한 뒤 이상이 없을 경우 지급하면 된다. 의뢰인의 입장에서는 공사가 완료되었다고 해서 바로 잔금을 지급하기보다는 3~4일 정도 후에 지급하는 것이 좋다. 눈에 바로 보이는 하자도 있지만, 실제 사용했을 때 나타나는 하자도 있기 때문이다. 그러므로 며칠 생활을 해보면서 점검 및 확인을 꼼꼼하게 한 후에 잔금을 지급하도록 한다.\n인테리어 공사의 일반적인 진행 순서\n① 공사 준비\n공사가 시작되기 1~2주 전에 아파트 관리사무소에 방문해서 공사의 범위 및 일정을 알린다. 대부분의 관리사무소에서는 해당 동의 같은 라인(혹은 동 전체)에 살고 있는 입주민 2/3 이상의 공사동의서를 받아올 것을 요구한다. (공사동의서와 공사안내문은 대부분 인테리어 업체에서 알아서 진행해준다.) 아파트라면 단지별로 정해진 엘리베이터 사용료도 확인해야 한다.\n② 공사 시작\n본격적인 공사를 시작하기 3~4일 전 엘리베이터, 건물 출입구 등에 공사안내문을 게시한다. 공사안내문에는 공사기간 및 공사의 범위 등을 기재한다. 공사로 인해 소음이 가장 심하게 발생하는 날(욕실, 바닥 타일 등의 철거, 발코니 확장 등)이 언제인지 함께 기재하는 것이 좋다.\n③ 철거 공사\n싱크대와 몰딩 철거는 크게 소음이 나지 않지만, 욕실 타일 철거와 발코니 확장으로 인한 철거 작업 시에는 소음과 먼지가 많이 발생한다. 주변 입주민에게 민원이 들어올 수도 있기 때문에 너무 이른 시간과 늦은 오후 시간에 작업하는 것은 피한다.\n④ 전기 및 설비 공사\n싱크대의 구조를 변경하거나 욕실 배관 등을 교체할 때는 설비 공사가 필요하다. 거실이나 방 발코니를 확장하는 경우, 확장되는 부분 바닥에 보일러 배관 설치가 진행된다.\n⑤ 새시 및 문틀 교체\n발코니 확장 또는 새시 교체, 내부 문(문틀) 교체가 있을 경우, 기존의 틀을 철거 한 후 새로운 틀로 교체한다. 이때 공사의 원활한 진행을 위해 틀만 먼저 설치하고 문(창문)은 공사가 어느 정도 진행된 후에 설치하게 된다.\n⑥ 목공사\n목공사는 목재를 써서 하는 모든 공사를 일컫는 용어다. 인테리어 현장에서 천장 작업, 몰딩 작업, 거실 아트월, 중문 설치 시 가벽 작업 등이 목공사로 진행된다. 이 단계에서 천장에 설치되는 전등의 위치가 최종적으로 정해지기 때문에 자신이 원하는 위치가 있다면 사전에 공사 관계자에게 정확한 위치를 알려주는 것이 좋다. 발코니 확장을 위한 벽면 단열재 공사도 대부분 이때 함께 진행된다.\n⑦ 타일 공사\n인테리어 공사에서 의외로 타일 공사가 차지하는 비중이 크다. 현관 바닥, 싱크대 벽면, 발코니 바닥, 욕실(벽면, 바닥) 등을 동시에 진행하는 경우가 많다. 타일 공사 양이 많을 경우에는 욕실만 따로 작업하기도 한다.\n⑧ 필름지 공사 및 페인트 작업\n필름지(일명 시트지) 공사는 기존의 문이나 가구 등의 표면에 새로운 필름지를 입히는 작업으로 일종의 리폼이라고 생각하면 된다. 예전에는 문, 문틀 등에 페인트칠을 하는 경우가 많았는데, 최근에는 대부분 필름지 작업을 한다.\n필름지의 장점은 작업 후에 냄새가 없고, 색상이 다양하고 면처리가 깔끔해서 리폼의 완성도를 높일 수 있다는 것이다. 단점은 페인트에 비해 가격이 비싸다는 것이다. 최근 페인트 작업은 발코니와 창고 벽면에만 하는 추세다.\n⑨ 도배 및 바닥 공사\n도배와 바닥 시공은 가구가 설치되기 전에 해야 일의 진행속도가 빠르고 편하다. 하지만 가구 공사를 먼저 하는 경우도 있다. 싱크대 같은 가구를 먼저 설치하고 도배해야 가구와 벽면 또는 천장 사이의 이음새 부분을 도배지로 자연스럽게 덮어 가릴 수 있어 마감처리면에서 효과적이기 때문이다.\n반대로 도배를 먼저 한 후 가구를 설치하게 되면 이음새 부분에 미세하게 틈이 생긴다. 미세한 틈을 투명 실리콘으로 마감해도 상관은 없지만 섬세한 작업 결과를 원한다면 가구 설치를 먼저 한 후에 도배 및 바닥공사를 시공하는 것이 좋다.\n참고로 도배 대신 페인트로 시공하려는 경우가 있다. 페인트는 도배지에 비해 색상을 다양하게 연출할 수 있고 비용이 저렴하다는 장점이 있지만, 벽면이 고르지 않을 경우 퍼팅 작업이 병행되어야 하므로 오히려 비용이 추가될 수 있다.\n⑩ 가구 공사\n싱크대, 붙박이장, 신발장 등이 시공된다. 대부분 사전에 디자인과 사이즈 측량이 완료되어 제작된 완성품이 배송되기 때문에 설치만 하면 된다.\n⑪ 전등 및 전기콘센트 커버 교체\n전등과 콘센트 커버는 외관상 노출되는 효과가 크다. 특히 거실과 주방(식탁) 전등의 경우 디자인이나 색상에 따라 집 안의 전체적인 분위기가 달라질 수 있다. 그러므로 업체에서 임의로 설치해주기 전에 본인의 취향에 맞는 디자인을 직접 선택하는 것이 좋다.\n⑫ 액세서리 설치\n발코니 천장의 빨래건조대, 문 손잡이(실린더), 욕실 액세서리(선반, 휴지걸이, 수건걸이 등), 방충망 등을 설치하면서 공사 관계자가 모든 일정을 마무리한다. 이때 커튼 설치를 위한 커튼봉 시공, 액자를 걸기 위한 못질, 인테리어 선반 설치 등등이 필요할 경우 부탁하면 거의 대부분 서비스로 해준다.\n⑬ 입주 청소\n찌든 때는 없지만 먼지가 많기 때문에 입주 청소를 해야 한다. 닦기를 수차례 반복해도 계속해서 먼지가 나오고 생각보다 청소가 쉽지 않다. 그러므로 비용이 들더라도 웬만하면 청소 전문가에게 입주 청소를 맡기는 것이 효율적이다.\n매일 현장에 방문해서 진행사항 체크하는 건 필수\n공사가 진행되는 기간 동안 바쁘더라도 매일 현장에 방문해보는 것이 좋다. 의뢰인이 현장에 자주 방문하면 일하는 사람들이 부담스러워할 수도 있기 때문에 아무도 없는 저녁시간에 방문하는 것을 추천한다. 그날그날 진행사항들을 체크하면서 계약 내용과 다르게 시공된 것이 있거나 수정 또는 보완 사항이 있을 경우 업체대표(또는 현장담당자)에게 바로 이야기하는 것이 좋다. 나중에는 공사 순서와 일정 또는 물리적인 상황 때문에 수정사항을 반영해주지 못하는 경우도 있기 때문에 미루지 말고 그때그때 바로 말하고 의견을 조율하는 것이 좋다.\n세금계산서(또는 부가세 영수증)를 발급받아야 할까?\n인테리어(집 수리)를 할 때 규모가 크지 않은 동네 업체에게 견적을 받을 때 부가세 10%를 내고 영수증을 발급받을지, 아니면 영수증을 발급받지 않고 부가세 10%를 절약할지 선택하라고 할 때가 있다.\n나중에 해당 주택을 매도할 때 양도소득세가 비과세라면 굳이 부가세를 끊을 필요가 없다. 그러나 다주택자이거나 혹은 향후 양도가액이 12억 원 초과로 양도소득세 부과가 예상될 경우 부가세 10%를 지급하고 영수증을 발급받아 놓는 것이 좋다.\n양도소득세 계산 시 필요경비로 공사비를 인정받을 수 있어서 절세를 할 수 있기 때문이다. 단, 부가세 영수증을 발급받을 때는 품목을 양도소득세에서 필요경비로 인정받을 수 있는 공사품목으로 발급받아야 한다.\n\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 윤여진",
