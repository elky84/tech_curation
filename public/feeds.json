        "content:encodedSnippet": "Previously in this series:\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 1: A Minimal Coding Agent\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 2: A Deeper Dive Into Tools\nTwo articles in, and our coding agent can already do quite a bit. It can explore projects, read and write code, execute shell commands, and run tests. Adding a definition of done (DoD) in our last article gave it the feedback loop it needed – the agent now iterates until all tests pass, not until it decides it’s done.\nWe should be celebrating, right? Well, yes and no.\nAs the agent gets more capable, debugging becomes more challenging. Each tool adds surface area. The DoD loop adds more calls and tokens. Evaluation runs can take hours, and when something fails, it is often unclear what failed or where the issue started.\nOur agent can solve tasks now. Too bad we can’t see how.\nThis becomes a problem when you want to improve the agent, debug failures, or estimate costs. In this article, we work through this visibility gap. We start with the obvious options (they don’t quite work), review common observability tools for LLM apps, and integrate tracing with Langfuse. The result is a step-by-step view of the agent’s actions, including cost per action. Along the way, we uncover behavioral patterns and even find a bug we didn’t know existed.\nLet’s start by understanding what we’re missing.\nYour agent story\nWhen your agent completes a coding task, it produces a chain of decisions and actions: Read this file, analyze that function, modify this code, run those tests. This chain is the agent’s trajectory, and it tells the story of how the agent works.\nTrajectories matter because they reveal where the agent wastes time and where it goes off track. They show you when the agent reads the same file 47 times, or why it rewrites half your codebase when you asked for a simple bug fix. In short, you can’t improve what you can’t observe.\nUp to now, we’ve been getting by with this simple setup:\nhandleEvents {  \n    onToolCallStarting { ctx ->  \n        println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")  \n    }  \n}\nThis was fine for the early steps. It at least showed activity. But we’ve outgrown it. Without full parameters and observations, we can’t understand agent behavior in enough detail. And if we print everything, the console turns into noise: object dumps, file contents, and error messages all mixed together.\nWe need something better.\n“Just turn on logging”\nLet’s try the obvious solution first. Koog has built-in debug logging, so we switch Logback from ERROR to DEBUG and run it again:\n\n\n\n\nThree minutes and thousands of lines later: Informative? Yes. Convenient? No! \nVerbose logs have their place. In production, they help with postmortems. They also help when you want to extract insights and analyze behavior patterns across many runs. But when you’re debugging a single run and trying to understand why your agent is stuck in a loop, you need something built for humans, not statistical analysis.\nThe money trail\nWhile those logs aren’t ideal for debugging, they did remind us about something else we should be tracking: usage statistics. OpenAI’s dashboard provides detailed breakdowns of API consumption per key. It answers one question quickly: Are we burning through our budget?\nBut it still doesn’t answer the question that matters during development: What does one run cost?\n\n\n\n\nOkay, $25 in one week. Useful, but not the complete picture. The OpenAI dashboard does what it’s designed to do: track organization-level API usage. But for agent development, we need run-level insights. We can see the total, but not which tasks cost $0.50 and which cost $5.00.\nNow add more moving parts. If we split work across sub-agents and use different providers for specific steps (to be discussed in upcoming articles), we end up with multiple dashboards and no single view of the true cost of a run. And if several people share the same agent setup, it gets even harder to see who spent what and where.\nThe API key approach works for one agent, one provider, and limited runs. It’s a start, but it doesn’t scale. We need observability.\nThe four-line integration\nWe’re not the first to encounter this issue. Over the last few years, an ecosystem of observability tools has formed around LLM apps and agents. There are proprietary tools such as Weights & Biases Weave and LangSmith, as well as open-source options like Langfuse, Opik, Arize Phoenix, OpenLLMetry, Helicone, OpenLIT, and Lunary. Some are cloud-based, others support self-hosting, and some offer both. Each comes with its own strengths and trade-offs.\nAfter evaluating several options, our team chose Langfuse. The decision came down to practical factors: It’s open source with a self-hosted option (so traces stay under your control), it offers a free cloud tier for getting started, the UI makes it easier to inspect traces, and the team is responsive when questions come up.\nThe integration itself is straightforward. Koog needs four lines to connect to Langfuse:\n) {\n+   install(OpenTelemetry) {  \n+       setVerbose(true) \n+       addLangfuseExporter()  \n+   }\n    handleEvents {  \n        // existing handlers remain\n    }\n}\nThat’s it.\nIf you use another OpenTelemetry-compatible service, generic OpenTelemetry integration works as well.\nA quick note about the setVerbose(true): Koog sends only telemetry metadata by default. Full details are sent only if you enable verbose mode. Prompts and responses remain hidden, which makes sense when traces can include customer data. During agent development, you often need full visibility, and verbose mode enables that.\nSetting up Langfuse takes about five minutes. For this article, we’re using their free cloud instance, but you can also run the full stack locally in Docker.\nCreate an account at cloud.langfuse.com.\nCreate an organization.\nCreate a project.\nClick Create API Key.\nYou’ll get three values:\nexport LANGFUSE_HOST=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\nexport LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=\"<your-public-key>\"\nexport LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=\"<your-secret-key>\"\nKoog reads these values from the execution environment. If you need to pass them in code, you can pass them directly to addLangfuseExporter. Here’s our complete agent with observability enabled:\nval executor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    promptExecutor = executor,\n    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5Codex,\n    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n        tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))\n        tool(ExecuteShellCommandTool(JvmShellCommandExecutor(), PrintShellCommandConfirmationHandler()))\n    },\n    systemPrompt = \"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled programmer tasked with updating the provided codebase according to the given task.\n        Your goal is to deliver production-ready code changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase and solve given task.\n        Ensure minimal possible changes done - that guarantees minimal impact on existing functionality.\n        \n        You have shell access to execute commands and run tests.\n        After investigation, define expected behavior with test scripts, then iterate on your implementation until the tests pass.\n        Verify your changes don't break existing functionality through regression testing, but prefer running targeted tests over full test suites.\n        Note: the codebase may be fully configured or freshly cloned with no dependencies installed - handle any necessary setup steps.\n        \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n    strategy = singleRunStrategy(ToolCalls.SEQUENTIAL),\n    maxIterations = 400\n) {\n    install(OpenTelemetry) {\n        setVerbose(true) // Send full strings instead of HIDDEN placeholders\n        addLangfuseExporter()\n    }\n    handleEvents {\n        onToolCallStarting { ctx ->\n            println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe first trace\nLet’s start with a simple task: Find the main() function in your project. Run it, wait for it to finish, and then open the Tracing tab in your Langfuse project.\n\n\n\n\nImmediately, the table displays something useful: the Total Cost column. Koog reports token counts, Langfuse applies pricing, and you can see that finding main() costs $0.016.\nOpen the trace to see the full run.\n\n\n\n\nThe left-hand panel shows your agent’s trajectory: messages, tool calls, and observations in order, with indentation indicating the call hierarchy. The right-hand panel displays details for each step: prompts, responses, tool parameters, and per-span cost breakdown.\nAt the bottom, you’ll also see an execution graph that visualizes the flow. For more details on Koog’s graph-based strategies, check out the documentation. You can also read a deep dive by the Koog tech lead: Mixing the Secret AI Sauce: How to Design a Flexible, Graph-Based Strategy in Koog.\nDiscovering issues through observability\nWhile preparing examples for this article, we noticed a failed tool call highlighted in red.\n\n\n\n\nThe observation was:\nendLine=400 must be <= lineCount=394 or -1\nThe agent requested lines 0–400, but the file had only 394 lines. This points to a limitation in our tool implementation. Instead of failing, it should clamp the range and return the available lines (0–394), allowing the agent to continue. Without traces, this kind of issue often gets buried in logs. With traces, you see it in the exact run, at the exact step, and with the exact input.\nThat’s why observability matters. It shows not just that something failed, but also how and why, which makes fixes much easier.\nWorking with evaluation runs\nSingle traces are great for debugging, but evaluation runs need a batch view. \nWhen you run your agent across multiple SWE-bench Verified tasks (a standard benchmark for coding agents), you want grouped traces and aggregated cost.\nLangfuse supports this through sessions. Add a session ID as a trace attribute:\ninstall(OpenTelemetry) {\n    setVerbose(true)\n    addLangfuseExporter(  \n        traceAttributes = listOf(  \n            CustomAttribute(\"langfuse.session.id\", \"eval-run-1\"),  \n        )  \n    )\n}\nYou can also add other attributes, such as user IDs or environment tags. See the trace-level attributes documentation if you need them. For now, session grouping is enough.\nWith this configuration, traces from the evaluation share a session ID. In Langfuse, navigate to the Sessions tab to see aggregate duration and total cost.\n\n\n\n\nIn our run, we executed 50 SWE-bench Verified tasks (out of 500). With ten parallel instances, the run took 30 minutes and cost $66. This gives a baseline for future experiments: success rate, runtime, and cost.\nLangfuse doesn’t show success scores by default. That’s expected. Tracing records what happened, not whether a run passed. If you want success metrics in Langfuse, your evaluation harness needs to score each attempt and report custom scores. It’s worth implementing if you have the supporting infrastructure.\nLooking ahead\nObservability isn’t just about debugging. It’s also how you learn about the agent’s behavior. \nWith a few lines of code, we turned the agent from a black box into something you can inspect. We caught that line-range error that would likely have gone unnoticed. We learned that our 50-task evaluation costs $66. And we can now see which tasks consume tokens and which run efficiently.\nIn the next article, we’ll introduce a sub-agent pattern: Delegate specific tasks to smaller, cheaper models. With traces in place, you can decide what to delegate based on what the agent does in each run. No more guessing.\nResources\nComplete code for this article\nKoog OpenTelemetry documentation\nKoog Langfuse integration\nLangfuse OpenTelemetry support\nThank you for reading!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we love seeing the developer community grow and thrive. That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference — the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and to contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this edition, we highlight four projects spanning Rust, Go, and JavaScript. Different as they are, each shares the same goal: keeping systems reliable.\nfrp\nOriginally created to make it easier to share local APIs with teammates, frp (Fast Reverse Proxy) has grown into a global open-source favorite. It’s lightweight, easy to configure, and supports multiple protocols – perfect for developers who need to share local services or access remote environments without complex network setup.\nAs frp grew into a complex codebase, I switched to GoLand, which significantly improved my productivity. Intelligent code completion, a powerful debugger, seamless refactoring, and intuitive navigation became indispensable in my everyday workflow.\nSince frp attracts contributors with different levels of experience, GoLand has become a vital tool in simplifying their workflows – with its ready-to-use, beginner-friendly environment, it drastically reduces the learning curve and the setup work that often frustrates beginners. I confidently recommend GoLand as the go-to IDE for contributing to frp or any other Go project.\n— fatedier, frp creator\nThe team’s roadmap includes lightweight VPN-like capabilities that will allow multiple frpc nodes to form virtual networks, along with a major v2 overhaul aimed at delivering advanced functionality across both Layer 7 (application) and Layer 4 (transport) features.\nSniffnet\nSniffnet, written entirely in Rust, lets users visualize network traffic in real time. It was designed as an intuitive, easy-to-use monitoring tool that allows anyone – not just network experts – to comfortably analyze their internet activity. Instead of unreadable packet data, Sniffnet displays clear, flow-level details such as domain names, countries, and services, giving users an immediate understanding of their network traffic.\nWhat I love most about RustRover is how seamlessly it integrates with my usual workflows – using rustfmt, clippy, and testing tools. And since I’ve used other JetBrains IDEs in the past, RustRover instantly feels like home with its familiar, intuitive interface.\n— Giuliano Bellini, Sniffnet creator\nSniffnet’s upcoming roadmap includes process identification, custom IP blacklists, remote host monitoring via an agent, and OS-level firewall integrations – all aimed at making network monitoring secure and approachable for everyone.\nVitest\nVitest was designed to be a simple testing tool for Vite applications, with a focus on the shared build configuration. Over time, it’s evolved into a go-to testing framework for fast, reliable JavaScript testing across ecosystems.\nSince the early days, JetBrains has collaborated with the team to provide the best IDE experience. My favorite feature is the debug button – I always struggled with JavaScript’s built-in debugger before trying it in WebStorm.\n— Vladimir, Vitest maintainer\nThe Vitest team continues to innovate with the latest developments of the Browser Mode and upcoming improvements to benchmarking and type-checking support – all in service of making testing easy and approachable.\nbottom\nbottom started as a personal spin on gotop and similar tools. Originally a résumé project, it gradually evolved into a popular terminal-based system monitor built in Rust. The project was originally called “rustop”, but since that name was already taken, the creator simply took things in the opposite direction and called it “bottom”!\nI regularly use RustRover for open-source projects like bottom – it’s packed with great features, and it’s convenient to stay within the JetBrains ecosystem since I use other JetBrains products at work.\n— Clement Tsang, bottom creator\nBottom proves that even the simplest tools can evolve into powerful, community-driven utilities, and that approachable design matters, even on the command line.\nThese projects showcase a common truth: Great developer experience happens when tools get out of your way. With JetBrains IDEs enhancing everything from code navigation to collaboration, these teams turn ideas into usable, elegant tools.\nExplore these projects, contribute if you can, or start your own! RustRover, WebStorm, CLion, Rider, RubyMine, DataGrip, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm are free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute.\nMore from this series\n                                                        \nCLion and the Open-Source Community: Growing Together\nFrom the beginning, CLion has been shaped by the needs of C and C++ developers around the world.

The kotlinx-benchmark library helps you measure and compare performance across different implementations or hardware configurations.\nHowever, raw text results only take you so far. Sometimes you need to visualize your data, not just read it. That’s where Kotlin notebooks come in.\nKotlin notebooks combine the expressiveness of Kotlin with the interactivity of notebook-style development.

This release contains important bug-fixes as well as feature updates.\nLet’s take a look at what’s been improved.\nRider 2025.3.0.4\nMulti-agent experience in the AI Chat window: Junie and Claude Agent\nClaude Agent has become the first third-party AI agent natively integrated into JetBrains IDEs. With its addition, JetBrains introduces a multi-agent experience that brings even more flexibility and power to your development workflow. Now that Claude Agent and Junie are available in the same chat interface, you can switch between agents seamlessly and get the right kind of assistance for every task.\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to start working with any agent now is to launch it directly from the AI chat. However, the Junie plugin (and some of its features exclusively) will still be available for you if you prefer to use Junie it this way.\nLearn more here.\nTransparent AI quota tracking in the IDE\nYou can now view your remaining AI credits, renewal date, and top-up balance directly inside your IDE, and if you run out of credits, you can initiate a top-up from there as well. This update makes it easier to monitor and manage your AI resources – bringing more clarity and convenience to your AI usage. \n\n\n\n\nIn Junie, if your task uses more than 1.2 AI credits, you will get a notification. This feature is currently available in the Junie plugin and will be coming to the AI chat soon.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about AI quotas in this blog post.\n[Coming Soon] Bring Your Own Key\nWith BYOK, you will be able to connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI API-compatible local model using your own API key, without logging into JetBrains AI. This gives you more control over how you use AI in IntelliJ IDEA, and it’s ideal if you prefer to work with a specific provider.\nThis setup is particularly powerful when paired with a JetBrains AI subscription (including the free tier), which provides enhanced completion, extra models, and bonus credits while still allowing you to use your own key for chat and agents.\nLearn more here. \nGame development\nRider now provides cloud-powered multi-line code completion for shaders in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot projects.For Godot developers, cloud completion suggestions are also available for GDScript files.\nWorking with databases\nRider replaces the term query console with query file – because consoles have essentially always been files, and it’s time the UI reflected that. We’ve also simplified the workflow, making it more discoverable and consistent. You can learn more about the change in this post. \nNotable fixes included in this build:\nWe’ve resolved the issue of excessive memory usage when opening .NET 6 solutions [RIDER-132952].\nRider now ships with the correct IJent version, restoring full WSL support. Git, Docker integration, terminals, and device discovery over WSL work reliably again. [IJPL-219668]\nDeploying to Android devices now works reliably again. Rider correctly uploads the application APK file, even when a previous version is already installed on the device. [RIDER-132740]\nRendered documentation now correctly displays code containing < and > characters. [RIDER-119249]\nSearch Everywhere now returns results in a stable, predictable order. [RIDER-132113]\nSource-generated files from System.Text.Json are now detected correctly and no longer produce false errors. [RIDER-132634]\nFor the complete list of resolved issues, please refer to our issue tracker. \nDownload Rider 2025.3.0.4\n                                                    \nReSharper 2025.3.0.4 \n\n\n\n\nHere are the most notable fixes included in this update:\nSQL/NoSQL support can now be excluded from the dotUltimate installer. An installation key is available for silent setups, allowing teams to omit these features when not needed. [RSRP-501992]\nThe Unit Test Output panel in Out-of-Process mode now shows vertical scrollbars correctly, making long test output fully navigable again. [RSRP-501537]\nFor the full list of issues resolved in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.\nDownload ReSharper 2025.3.0.4\n                                                    \nYou can download the latest builds from our website (Rider, ReSharper) or via the Toolbox App. You can also update Rider as a snap.",

Whether you’re trying to keep reports error-free, managing user roles, or setting up environments, Datalore 2025.6 adds new tools that will help you stay organized and productive. \nIssue center\nThe issue center is available to help your teams monitor and resolve errors in published reports. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike notebooks, reports run code behind the scenes and hide technical details from viewers, so identifying and fixing issues in them can be difficult. The issue center tracks the errors from all reports in a workspace and displays them in one place, where you can search, filter, and resolve them with ease. Read more\nUsages tab for databases\nDatabase connections now include a Usages tab, where you can see all the notebooks and cells that rely on a particular connection. This makes it easier to understand where a connection is used, track dependencies, and quickly reuse or update code across your workspace. Read more\nOption to change a user role to viewer\nIn Datalore On-Premises, you can now directly change someone’s role from user to viewer without having to delete the existing user account and then create a viewer from scratch. Because the licensing for Datalore On-Premises is based on the number of user seats, this streamlined role change can help you optimize license usage. Read more\nWe also improved the viewer UI to deliver a cleaner experience for those who can view notebooks and reports but don’t need to edit them.\nAll reports and Recents tabs\nA new All reports tab on the home page allows you to access all the reports available to you, including those shared with you directly or via a workspace, as well as any publicly available reports that you have previously accessed. The Recents tab now includes recently opened reports in addition to notebooks.\n\n\n\n\nInteractive report recalculation\nWhen reports are opened, it’s crucial that they contain accurate data. Datalore users can configure whether report viewers are prompted to recalculate interactive reports on open, and instance administrators can select the default behavior in the Admin panel. \nWe’ve added the option to recalculate all reports automatically, ensuring that viewers always see the most up-to-date results without requiring manual confirmation.\nAbility to share individual reports from shared workspaces\nYou can now share individual reports without sharing the whole workspace or making the report public.\nAutomatic environment installation\nWe’ve added automatic environment installation for pip-based environments on machine start. When you specify an environment and Python version in the Admin panel, they will be installed as the machine boots. This feature uses uv as the package manager.\nTo learn more about all the updates, see the What’s new page in the Datalore documentation.\n      \n      Upgrade to 2025.6",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Search Everywhere dialog is one of the most important entry points in the IntelliJ Platform. To future-proof this core feature and ensure its optimal performance in remote development, we have completely rewritten the underlying architecture, and we’re introducing a brand-new API for plugin developers.\nThis is a critical update for anyone contributing custom results to Search Everywhere, particularly for plugins that need to support remote environments.\nWhy the rewrite? The challenge of remote development\nThe need for a new API stemmed directly from our ongoing commitment to remote development.\nThe original SearchEverywhereContributor extension point was designed for the traditional, monolithic (local) IDE architecture. It coupled the search result data with the UI renderer responsible for displaying that data. This tight coupling became a significant blocker for our split-architecture remote solution:\nThe backend/frontend problem: In remote development, search logic often runs on a powerful backend machine, but the results must be displayed on the lightweight frontend.\nSerialization issue: Because SearchEverywhereContributor coupled data and presentation, it was impossible to reliably serialize third-party search results – both the data and its appearance – and safely send them across the network from the backend process to the frontend client.\nTo solve this, we initiated a deep rewrite of Search Everywhere to separate data and logic from UI presentation, enabling seamless and performant remote execution for all plugins.\nThe new API: Separation of data and UI\nFrontend components\nThese components primarily manage the user interface and presentation logic.\nSeTab\n\nAn interface representing a single tab within the Search Everywhere dialog.\nLives on the frontend only.\nSeTabFactory\n\nA factory for creating SeTab instances.\nServes as an extension point for adding new tab types.\nCore data and logic (backend/frontend)\nThese components are responsible for fetching and structuring the search results.\nSeItemsProvider\n\nThe conceptual analog of the older SearchEverywhereContributor.\nCan run on both the backend and frontend.\nReturns search results that include a serializable presentation – a standardized way to describe the item’s appearance. By ensuring that the results returned by SeItemsProvider include a serializable presentation, we can transmit them over the network and reliably render the results on the client, regardless of which process generated them.\nSeItemsProviderFactory\n\nA factory for creating SeItemsProvider instances.\nServes as an extension point for adding new result sources.\nMigration and compatibility\nSeLegacyItemPresentationProvider\n\nA simplified mechanism designed to help existing SearchEverywhereContributor implementations adapt quickly for remote development compatibility.\nWhat this means for your plugin\nWe have implemented adapters for all existing legacy SearchEverywhereContributor implementations.\nIn a monolith (local) environment: Existing plugins should continue to work almost exactly as before, with no immediate changes required.\nIn a remote development environment (2025.2 onwards): The new Search Everywhere architecture is now enabled by default. Plugins supporting remote execution must either implement the new API or ensure their legacy results use a serializable presentation format that our adapters can manage. For a simpler, temporary presentation method, you can use SeLegacyItemPresentationProvider.\nThe path forward – Migration recommended\nWhile the adapters provide a temporary bridge, we encourage all plugin developers to try the new API and provide feedback while it’s in the experimental phase. Once the new API has been refined based on the community’s input, we will start deprecating the old API.\nRollout plan\nWe are committed to a smooth transition and are rolling out the new Search Everywhere architecture gradually:\n2025.2: The new Search Everywhere architecture is enabled by default in remote development.\n2026.1 (planned): The new architecture is enabled by default in monolith environments.\n2026.2 (tentative): The new API is no longer experimental, and the old API is deprecated\nWe understand that changing a core API is a significant step, but this rewrite is essential for the future of the IntelliJ Platform and your ability to serve users in modern, remote environments.\nWe are excited to see the improved performance and remote capabilities this change will bring to your plugins!\n\n\n\n\nThe IntelliJ Platform team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Running TeamCity in Kubernetes has always been possible, but it often required knowing your way around both systems pretty well.\nTeamCity is flexible and easy to tune, and Kubernetes provides excellent tools for running applications at scale. However, bringing the two together smoothly wasn’t always straightforward.\nThe new TeamCity Operator is designed to change that. It uses custom resources to automate the management of your TeamCity server life cycle. For example, it allows you to automatically deploy new servers and perform zero-downtime upgrades (see the Kubernetes documentation for more details).\nAlthough the TeamCity Operator was originally designed to support internal use cases, interest from users running sizable Kubernetes-based installations encouraged us to make it open source. It’s now publicly available and ready for you to explore.\nWhy an operator?\nThe most common way to deploy applications to Kubernetes is through Helm charts. Helm works well for many services, but it has limitations when it comes to applications that require orchestrated, stateful operations, such as controlled upgrades, multi-node setups, or zero-downtime updates.\nTeamCity fits squarely into this category. Its life cycle is complex and nuanced. Updates require sequencing, certain states must be preserved, and there are moments when two versions must temporarily coexist.\n\nTeamCity OperatorTeamCity Helm charts\nGo applicationCollection of templated YAML files\nSingle object that controls everything needed for TeamCityNo control over the life cycle\nMinimal need to think about dependencies in KubernetesUpdateable fields in objects only\n\n\n\n\n\nKubernetes operators exist precisely for these cases. An operator is an application that runs inside a cluster and encodes expert knowledge about how to deploy, upgrade, and maintain a particular system. Instead of asking you to understand every nuance of TeamCity’s Kubernetes behavior, the TeamCity Operator takes on that work.\nHow it works\nThe TeamCity Operator introduces a new Kubernetes custom resource that represents a TeamCity installation. When you apply it to the cluster, the TeamCity Operator inspects this object and turns it into a fully configured, running TeamCity instance.\nIn practice, this means the TeamCity Operator:\nCreates and configures the necessary StatefulSets.\nEnsures the startup and shutdown sequences are executed correctly.\nApplies changes to the TeamCity installation based on updates to the custom resource specification.\nManages upgrades, including optional zero-downtime ones.\nCoordinates the main and secondary nodes in multi-node setups.\n\n\n\n\nThe TeamCity Operator continuously watches the Kubernetes API for changes. When you update the TeamCity custom resource spec (for example, by changing the version or resource settings), the TeamCity Operator reconciles the actual state with the desired one.\nIn other words, you declare what TeamCity should look like, and the TeamCity Operator makes your vision a reality.\nExample: Deploying a TeamCity main node with an external database\nTo give you a concrete idea of how the TeamCity Operator is used in practice, here is an example of deploying a standalone TeamCity main node that connects to an external database.\nThis example demonstrates how database configuration is passed via a Kubernetes Secret and how the TeamCity custom resource defines the main node, resources, and storage.\napiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  connectionProperties.password: DB_PASSWORD\n  connectionProperties.user: DB_USER\n  connectionUrl: DB_CONNECTION_STRING # format jdbc:mysql://DB_HOST:DB_PORT/SCHEMA_NAME\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: database-properties\n---\napiVersion: jetbrains.com/v1beta1\nkind: TeamCity\nmetadata:\n  name: teamcity-with-database\n  namespace: default\n  finalizers:\n    - \"teamcity.jetbrains.com/finalizer\"\nspec:\n  image: jetbrains/teamcity-server\n  databaseSecret:\n    secret: database-properties\n  mainNode:\n    name: main-node\n    spec:\n      env:\n        AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: \"eu-west-1\"\n      requests:\n        cpu: \"900m\"\n        memory: \"1512Mi\"\n  dataDirVolumeClaim:\n    name: teamcity-data-dir\n    volumeMount:\n      name: teamcity-data-dir\n      mountPath: /storage\n    spec:\n      accessModes:\n        - ReadWriteOnce\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\nBuilt-in life cycle management\nWe’ve spent years refining the life cycle of a TeamCity server (startup, updates, and clean shutdown) for TeamCity Cloud. The new operator brings these practices to self-hosted users.\nFor upgrades, the TeamCity Operator can perform a quick update with downtime or run an orchestrated, zero-downtime upgrade process, keeping at least one TeamCity node available while switching versions behind the scenes\nThese workflows go far beyond what a Helm chart can reliably encode.\nConfiguration as code with the TeamCity Operator, Terraform, and the Kotlin DSL\nThe TeamCity Operator is focused on life cycle and cluster-level configuration. It gives you a running TeamCity instance but intentionally leaves higher-level configuration to other tools.\nYou can combine it with:\nThe Terraform Provider for TeamCity for managing server-level settings, cleanup rules, VCS roots, project templates, and other global configuration elements.\nThe Kotlin DSL or YAML for per-project build configurations.\nTogether, these create a complete and consistent code-driven setup:\nThe TeamCity Operator installs, scales, upgrades, and tears down TeamCity.\nTerraform configures global server behavior.\nThe Kotlin DSL or YAML defines the builds themselves.\nThis allows you to manage every part of TeamCity with code and keep the configuration fully version-controlled.\nWhy use the TeamCity Operator?\nTo put it simply, the TeamCity Operator offers a hassle-free way to run TeamCity in Kubernetes.\nIt gives you:\nA minimal starting manifest for quick setups.\nAn extended manifest for more advanced installations.\nAn automated life cycle that reduces the risk of misconfiguration.\nConsistent behavior across environments.\nA path toward a fully code-driven, reproducible CI/CD infrastructure.\nIf you’re running TeamCity as part of your CI/CD setup (especially in a Kubernetes-heavy environment), the TeamCity Operator helps take some of the pressure off. It reduces your day-to-day workload and makes long-term maintenance much easier.\nWhat’s next\nWe’re preparing official documentation to accompany the TeamCity Operator. In the meantime, you can explore the GitHub repository, which includes solid documentation in the README.\nFor now, the GitHub repository includes examples and technical notes, and we’ll expand them over time. We also plan to publish migration guides and usage examples, particularly around combining the TeamCity Operator with Terraform and the Kotlin DSL.\nYou’ll also see the TeamCity Operator featured at industry events such as KubeCon, where our engineers will be available to give a walk-through of the design and answer questions.\n👉 Check out the GitHub repository 👈",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is the first guest post in a two-part series from José Luis González. José Luis has a PhD in software development and is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer, who works with developers and engineering teams to deepen their Kotlin skills and apply the language effectively in real projects. At Hyperskill, he runs Kotlin instructor-led training for teams at Hyperskill that focus on advanced topics and practical problem-solving rather than theory.\n1. What are the top 3 Kotlin anti-patterns from self-taught teams, and how do you fix each one?\nThis is a good question. The basic anti-pattern I see in self-taught Kotlin teams is that they still design hierarchies of abstract classes, factories, and deep inheritance trees because that’s how they learned Java. But Kotlin thrives on data-oriented, sealed, and expression-based designs. Overusing inheritance leads to fragile hierarchies, bloated APIs, and code that fights Kotlin’s strengths.\nThe simplest improvement is to flatten your design. Use sealed classes, data classes, and when expressions to model domain state declaratively instead of relying on polymorphism. Prefer composition and smart constructors over inheritance.\nMoving to what’s catching my attention in the last 2 years, I see subtler issues from teams that already “know Kotlin,” but haven’t kept up with how the language evolved. \nA major issue I still see is the use of ambient singletons: things like global object repositories or custom service locators. They make code look simpler at first, but in reality they hide dependencies and make testing much harder. \nContext parameters would fix it: the successor to context receivers, so functions declare the services they need and callers supply them, no globals required:\ninterface Clock { \n  fun now(): Instant\n}\n\ncontext(_: Clock) \nfun stamp() = now()\n\nwith(object: Clock{ override fun now() = Clock.System.now() }) { \n  stamp() \n}\nThis is Beta in Kotlin 2.2 and replaces context receivers with IDE-assisted migration.\nAnother common trap is the illusion of type safety through typealias.\ntypealias UserId = String doesn’t create a new type as it’s only an alias, so UserId and String are fully interchangeable. In 2025, the idiomatic solution is to use value classes (inline classes), which introduce true domain types while remaining allocation-free at runtime.\n@JvmInline \nvalue class UserId(\n  val v: String\n)\n\nfun load(u: UserId) {}\n\n// load(\"abc\")    // not good\n\nload(UserId(\"abc\")) // better\nA more subtle anti-pattern I still see is treating coroutines as ‘threads with nicer syntax.’ The telltale signs are GlobalScope.launch, random runBlocking calls in production, and code that ignores structured concurrency entirely. The modern fix: stop launching in GlobalScope, tie every coroutine to a real scope or lifecycle, keep runBlocking in main() or tests, and use coroutineScope/supervisorScope to compose concurrent work instead of escaping it.\nsuspend fun load() = supervisorScope {\n  val a = async { repo.a() }; \n  val b = async { repo.b() }; \n  a.await() to b.await()\n}\nGlobalScope is a @DelicateCoroutinesApi escape hatch, and official guidance frames runBlocking as a bridge for tests and entry points, not production call paths.\n(Author’s remark: since Kotlin 2.0, K2 is the default compiler across JVM/Native/JS/Wasm: lean on these features confidently in KMP codebases.)\n2. When teams ask you about testing async Kotlin code, what’s the exact testing pattern you show them that works reliably in CI/CD?\n I show them one reliable pattern that scales and never flakes. The key is to inject dispatchers, not hardcode Dispatchers.IO, and test with runTest plus a StandardTestDispatcher (or MainDispatcherRule on Android). This lets you control virtual time deterministically using advanceTimeBy() or advanceUntilIdle(), so no real delays or sleeps are needed. Always assert both results and cancellation: tests should prove that CancellationException propagates and does not get swallowed.\nHere’s the compact pattern:\n@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)\n@Test fun flow_is_deterministic() = runTest {\n    val testDispatcher = StandardTestDispatcher(testScheduler)\n    val repo = Repo(svc = FakeSvc(), dispatchers = object : AppDispatchers {\n        override val io = testDispatcher; override val default = testDispatcher\n    })\n\n    val job = launch { assertEquals(\"A\" to \"B\", repo.load()) }\n    advanceUntilIdle()              // run coroutines deterministically\n    assertTrue(job.isCompleted)     // also test job.cancel() + advanceUntilIdle()\n}\nIf you’re testing a Flow, use Turbine instead of assertEquals:\nflow.test {\n    assertEquals(\"A\", awaitItem())\n    cancelAndIgnoreRemainingEvents()\n}\nThis pattern works consistently in CI/CD because it avoids timing flakiness, doesn’t rely on real delays, and enforces proper structured concurrency.\n3. A team just deployed their first Kotlin microservice and it’s using 3x more memory than expected. What’s your diagnostic checklist, and what are the most likely culprits?\nIf a new Kotlin microservice suddenly uses three times more memory than expected, I start by checking whether it’s really a Kotlin issue or just how the JVM behaves under load. The first thing is to see what kind of memory grows.\nIf the heap is flat but RSS keeps rising, it’s usually thread stacks or direct buffers. Each thread costs around 1-2 MB, and Dispatchers.IO can easily spin up hundreds under blocking I/O. Limit it:\n val io = Dispatchers.IO.limitedParallelism(64)\n❗ And make sure you’re not using raw threads where coroutines would do. That’s a common “Java habit” that quietly kills memory efficiency.\nNext, if the heap itself grows, look for unbounded coroutines or collections: things like Channel.UNLIMITED, flow.buffer() without limits, or caches that never evict. Backpressure fixes most of these:\nflow.buffer(256, onBufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST)\nThen check the HTTP layer. Frameworks like Ktor with CIO or Netty may buffer entire requests in memory. Stream instead of aggregating:\ncall.receiveChannel().copyTo(File(\"upload.bin\").outputStream())\nOn the JVM side, always set explicit container limits so it doesn’t grab all available RAM:\n-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60 -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=128m\nFinally, profile before guessing. I usually attach an async-profiler or JDK Flight Recorder to see where allocations come from, and combine that with jcmd VM.native_memory summary for off-heap diagnostics.\nIn short: use real coroutines, not threads; set memory caps; limit dispatcher parallelism; bound every buffer; and verify with profiling. That’s how you fix 90 % of “why is our Kotlin service eating all the RAM?” cases.\nJosé Luis González\nJosé Luis González, PhD, is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer who teaches Kotlin and advanced techniques to development teams.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "You’re a .NET developer with a busy morning, and an Azure DevOps ticket drops: “Login endpoint 500s under load.” You’ve got to fix it, review a teammate’s feature branch, and keep your repo clean – all before lunch. Visual Studio’s Git tools turn this everyday Git workflow of creating topic branches, stashing changes, committing, and handling PRs into a smooth, fast process.\nLet’s walk through your morning, showing how Visual Studio keeps Git friction out of your way.\n9:00 AM: Spin up a topic branch for your bug fix\nYour repo’s open in VS (View → Git Repository), and you’re on main, fresh from last night’s CI run. To keep your bug-fix isolated, you right-click main in the Git Repository Window, select New Local Branch From, and name it fix/auth-race-1, linking it to your DevOps ticket. You’re switched to the new branch instantly, and the 2026 Git status bar shows your branch and sync status, so you’re never lost.\n\nYou update AuthService.cs with an async lock to fix the race condition.\nA Slack ping from the PM interrupts: they need you to review a feature branch for a demo. Time to pause your work without losing it.\n9:30 AM: Stash changes to juggle tasks\nYou’re mid-fix with unsaved changes, not ready to commit. In the Git Changes Window (View → Git Changes), you select your modified files, click Stash All, and add a note: “WIP: Auth fix before demo.” Visual Studio shelves everything, leaving your directory clean.\n\nBranch switching in Visual Studio is a lot faster now thanks to optimized solution load and indexing. You polish the feature and push it to remote, all while your bug fix stays safely stashed.\nWith the feature review done, you’re ready to return to your bug fix and polish it before committing.\n10:15 AM: Pop stash and review code\nYou switch back to fix/auth-race-1, and Visual Studio’s fast branch switching keeps you moving. To restore your work, go to Git Changes Window, hit the Stash tab, right-click, and select Pop Stash. Your changes come back seamlessly.\nBefore committing, you want to catch any slip-ups. In Git Changes Window, click the Copilot Code Review button. Copilot scans your diff and leaves a few comments in the editor. You apply the suggestions with one click.\n\nFor extra confidence, open Copilot Chat (View → Copilot Chat), type “#changes Check security,” and get: “Add rate limiting for brute-force protection.” You tweak the code, catching more issues early, which makes your eventual PR cleaner.\nWith your code polished, you’re ready to commit your changes.\n10:45 AM: Time to commit\nYour code’s solid, so it’s time to commit. In the Git Changes Window, click the Generate Commit Message button. It’s formatted to your team’s standard (learn how to set that up in an earlier blog post), tied to DevOps, and saves you a minute. Push your changes with a click, keeping your history clean and team friendly.\n\nNow it’s time to share this with your team.\n11:15 AM: Create PR and review inline\nYour work is now ready for a review! Upon pushing, you get a banner in the Git Changes window and click the link to create a pull request. (Alternatively, you can also go to Git Repository Window and right-click fix/auth-race-1 → Create Pull Request.) In the PR creation UI, select your lead, Sarah, and another teammate, Mike, as reviewers by clicking the Add Reviewers field and choosing their names from the dropdown. Since there’s just one commit, VS automatically pulls Copilot’s commit message into the Azure DevOps PR description. You could also generate a PR description to ensure it matches your team’s standards. Click Create, and it’s up for review.\n\nSarah can easily review the PR right in Visual Studio, finding it assigned to her in the Git Repository Window.\n\nShe opens the PR and adds comments directly inside Visual Studio. The Markdown renders right in the diff, threaded and clear. No browser tabs needed!\n\nYou reply inline, make updates, and push your new changes. Visual Studio syncs the diff instantly. Reviews feel less cluttered, and Sarah and Mike approve. You merge to main and delete the branch to keep the repo clean.\nWrap-up: Git that flows\nVisual Studio’s Git tools – fast branch switches, visual diffs, Copilot commits, AI reviews, inline comments – save you time in your daily grind. Branching, stashing, and PRs are smoother than ever before, letting you focus on code. The AI review before committing catches mistakes early, setting your PRs up for success.\nTry it out and let us know what other Git topics you want to know more about in the comments below.\nHappy coding!\n \n \n \n \nThe post Streamlining your Git workflow with Visual Studio 2026 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

This setting directs new package installations to the fastest available mirror site, saving time during the upgrade process.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 2:</b> Clear any versionlock settings if they exist. This is especially important if versionlock was used to prevent kernel or other critical component updates for service stability. The upgrade will fail if versionlock restrictions remain in place, so they must be removed.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 3:</b> Install the Rocky Linux 10 packages on your system: rocky-gpg-keys, rocky-release, and rocky-repos.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 4:</b> If the rocky-repos package maintains old repository files pointing to Rocky Linux 9's GPG keys, errors will occur. Find and overwrite any *.rpmnew files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 5:</b> Install Rocky Linux 10 using the command: dnf distro-sync</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 6:</b> If you use the rpmfusion nonfree repository, the old EL9 version may remain on your system. Remove the outdated version and reinstall the Rocky Linux 10 version.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 6a:</b> Reboot the system after completing Step 6.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 7:</b> Re-enable the fastestmirror=1 option. This setting is removed during the reinstallation process and must be reconfigured.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 8:</b> Clean all temporary files using: dnf clean all</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 9:</b> Remove any remaining EL9 (old version) files. Use the command: rpm -e $(rpm -qa | grep '.el9.') 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'is needed by' | awk '{print $1}' to identify packages with dependencies. For packages with unresolvable dependencies, verify if they can be updated; otherwise, force remove them.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><b>Step 10:</b> Rebuild the rpm database.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">There are two bash scripts for automation, written below.

        "contentSnippet": "지난 7월 Rocky Linux 10이 출시되었다.[1] 하지만 로키리눅스는 오피셜한 업그레이드 방법을 제공하지 않기 때문에 약간 편법으로 업그레이드를 해야한다. 오리지널 레퍼런스는 reddit에 올라온 \"RHEL 10 upgrade from 9.6\"이다.[2] 하지만 원문에 몇 가지 자잘한 버그가 있어서 본인이 약간 수정했다. 그리고 자동화를 위해 bash script도 작성했다. 우선 오류를 수정한 원문을 요약, 정리하면 다음과 같다.\n \nHow to Upgrade Rocky Linux 9 to Rocky Linux 10\nNote: All commands require root user privileges.\nStep 0: Ensure you have root user access for all commands.\nStep 1: Enable the fastestmirror=1 option. This setting directs new package installations to the fastest available mirror site, saving time during the upgrade process.\nStep 2: Clear any versionlock settings if they exist. This is especially important if versionlock was used to prevent kernel or other critical component updates for service stability. The upgrade will fail if versionlock restrictions remain in place, so they must be removed.\nStep 3: Install the Rocky Linux 10 packages on your system: rocky-gpg-keys, rocky-release, and rocky-repos.\nStep 4: If the rocky-repos package maintains old repository files pointing to Rocky Linux 9's GPG keys, errors will occur. Find and overwrite any *.rpmnew files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.\nStep 5: Install Rocky Linux 10 using the command: dnf distro-sync\nStep 6: If you use the rpmfusion nonfree repository, the old EL9 version may remain on your system. Remove the outdated version and reinstall the Rocky Linux 10 version.\nStep 6a: Reboot the system after completing Step 6.\nStep 7: Re-enable the fastestmirror=1 option. This setting is removed during the reinstallation process and must be reconfigured.\nStep 8: Clean all temporary files using: dnf clean all\nStep 9: Remove any remaining EL9 (old version) files. Use the command: rpm -e $(rpm -qa | grep '.el9.') 2>&1 | grep 'is needed by' | awk '{print $1}' to identify packages with dependencies. For packages with unresolvable dependencies, verify if they can be updated; otherwise, force remove them.\nStep 10: Rebuild the rpm database.\nThere are two bash scripts for automation, written below. If the first script completes successfully, reboot the system and then run the second script.\n업그레이드 자동화 bash script\n위 프로세스를 자동화 하는 bash 스크립트는 다음과 같다. 스크립트 파일은 2개이며 첫번째 스크립트가 성공하면 재부팅한 뒤에 두번째 스크립트를 실행하면 된다. \nUpgrade to Rocky Linux 10\n\n\n \n업그레이드 bash script 1\n첫번째 스크립트는 Rocky Linux 9.x 에서 10.1로 업그레이드하는 스크립트이다. 본인이 작업하거나 서비스하는 서버, 컨설팅해주는 회사의 서버는 9.4와 9.6이었는데 해당 스크립트로 업그레이드에 성공하였다. 그래도 만일 실행 오류가 있다면 적절하게 AI에게 물어서 해결하도록 하면 될 것이다. 아마도 gemini, claude, copilot, chatGPT 등에 물어보면 아주 잘 대답해 줄 것이다. 참고로 docker-ce나 nvidia-driver의 업그레이드 문제는 뒤에 적어두었다.\n이 스크립트는 최대한 안전 코드를 넣어서 root 유저가 아니면 실행이 안되고, Rocky Linux 버전도 확인해서 9.x가 아니라면 작동하지 않도록 해두었다. 만일 업그레이드를 이미 한 뒤에 재실행하면 버전 체킹 때문에 실행이 중지될 것이다.\n#!/bin/bash\nROCKY_VER_SOURCE=9\nROCKY_VER=10.1\nREPO_URL=\"https://mirror.kakao.com/linux/rocky/${ROCKY_VER}/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/r/\"\nPKGS_FILENAME=(\n    rocky-gpg-keys-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    rocky-release-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    rocky-repos-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    )\n\nPKGS_URL=(\n    \"${PKGS_FILENAME[@]/#/$REPO_URL}\"\n    )\n\ncheck_el10_packages() {\n    local installed_count=0\n\n    for pkg_file in \"${PKGS_FILENAME[@]}\"; do\n        # .rpm을 제거하여 패키지명 추출\n        local pkg_name=\"${pkg_file%.rpm}\"\n\n        # rpm -q로 설치 여부 확인\n        if rpm -q \"$pkg_name\" > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n            ((installed_count++))\n        fi\n    done\n\n    # 1개 이상 EL10 프로그램이 설치되어 있으면 return 0\n    if [ $installed_count -gt 0 ]; then\n        return 0\n    else\n        return 1\n    fi\n}\n\necho \"Before you proceeding with the upgrade tasks below, you must first perform an update and reboot.\"\necho \"If you have already done so, press Enter.

미드저니(Midjourney)나 스테이블 디퓨전(Stable Diffusion) 같은 이미지 생성 AI들은 놀라운 예술 작품을 만들어내지만, 썸네일 제작에는 치명적인 단점이 하나 있었습니다. 바로 <b>'글자(Text)'를 정확하게 써내지 못한다는 점</b>이에요. 썸네일의 핵심은 시선을 끄는 이미지와 함께 명확한 메시지를 전달하는 카피라이팅인데, AI가 꼬불꼬불한 외계어만 그려 놓으니 결국 사용자가 포토샵으로 다시 텍스트 작업을 해야 하는 번거로움이 있었죠. 아, 정말 번거로웠어요!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이 근본적인 문제를 해결했습니다.</b> 이 앱에는 <b>구글의 최신 모델인 'Gemini Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)'가 탑재</b>되어 있어요. 이 모델은 단순히 그림을 잘 그리는 것을 넘어, <b>이미지 내에 정확한 텍스트를 렌더링하는 혁신적인 능력</b>을 갖췄습니다. 그리고 놀랍게도, 단순한 이미지 생성을 넘어 사용자의 의도를 파악하고 '기획(Strategy)'까지 할 수 있는 지능적인 AI로 진화했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발팀은 \"디자이너의 뇌(Brain)와 손(Hand)을 합치자\"는 목표로, 썸네일 기획부터 제작, 그리고 최종 보정까지 전 과정을 자동화하기 위해 이 앱을 만들었다고 해요. 2025년 현재, 이런 기능을 가진 AI는 정말 드물다고 생각합니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #8e44ad, #6200ea); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>'썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'의 핵심 기능들 ✨</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이제 여러분만의 <b>'수석 아트 디렉터'</b>가 되어줄 거예요. 마치 전담 디자이너를 둔 것처럼 든든하겠죠?

        "contentSnippet": "유튜브 영상의 성공은 단 1초, 썸네일에서 결정됩니다. 아무리 좋은 콘텐츠라도 클릭받지 못하면 빛을 볼 수 없죠. 디자이너 고용 비용, 직접 디자인하는 감각의 한계… 이 모든 고민을 단숨에 해결해 줄 혁신적인 AI 앱, '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'가 드디어 등장했습니다. 이제 여러분의 유튜브 채널도 30초 만에 떡상 시킬 수 있습니다!\n썸네일, 왜 그렇게 중요한가요?  \n\n\n\"내 영상은 왜 클릭이 안 될까?\" 유튜브 크리에이터라면 한 번쯤은 해봤을 고민일 거예요. 정말 정성 들여 만든 영상인데, 막상 업로드하고 나면 조회수가 기대에 못 미쳐서 실망했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 겁니다. 사실 유튜브 알고리즘의 핵심은 단순합니다. 바로 CTR(클릭률)이죠. 클릭이 많이 발생해야 알고리즘이 \"어, 이 영상 인기 있네?\"라고 판단하고 더 많은 사람들에게 노출시켜 주기 때문이에요.\n그런데 이 '클릭을 부르는 썸네일'을 만드는 게 생각보다 쉽지 않습니다. 단순한 그림 그리기나 예쁜 이미지 넣기가 아니거든요. 썸네일 속에는 사람의 시선을 사로잡는 고도의 심리학과 디자인 법칙이 숨어 있답니다. 예를 들어, 전 세계적으로 유명한 유튜버 MrBeast를 보면 그의 썸네일에는 몇 가지 일관된 특징이 있어요. 바로 고대비 색상, 과장된 표정, 그리고 3단어 이하의 짧고 강렬한 텍스트입니다. 이런 요소들이 시청자들의 호기심을 자극하고 클릭으로 이어진다는 거죠.\n  팁: 타겟 오디언스별 썸네일 전략\n썸네일 디자인은 타겟 오디언스에 따라 달라져야 합니다. 10대들은 도파민을 자극하는 화려하고 역동적인 이미지에 반응하지만, 시니어 층은 크고 명확한 글씨와 편안한 색감에 더 끌리죠.\n이처럼 성공하는 썸네일에는 명확한 공식이 존재합니다. 하지만 이 공식을 매번 직접 연구하고 디자인에 적용하기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니죠. 디자이너를 고용하자니 비용이 만만치 않고, 직접 포토샵을 켜자니 디자인 감각이 부족하다고 느끼는 분들이 많을 겁니다. 바로 이런 분들을 위해 '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'가 탄생했어요. 이 앱은 단순한 그림 도구가 아닙니다. '성공하는 썸네일 공식'을 완벽하게 학습한 AI가 기획부터 디자인까지 모든 과정을 원스톱으로 처리해 줍니다. 이제 디자이너에게 매번 의뢰비를 주는 대신, AI와 함께 커피 한 잔 값도 안 되는 비용으로 무한대의 썸네일 시안을 뽑아볼 수 있게 된 거죠. 정말 매력적이지 않나요?\n기존 AI의 한계를 넘어서: 탄생 배경  \n\"기존 AI 그림 도구들은 왜 썸네일을 제대로 못 만들까?\" 이런 의문을 가져본 적 없으신가요? 미드저니(Midjourney)나 스테이블 디퓨전(Stable Diffusion) 같은 이미지 생성 AI들은 놀라운 예술 작품을 만들어내지만, 썸네일 제작에는 치명적인 단점이 하나 있었습니다. 바로 '글자(Text)'를 정확하게 써내지 못한다는 점이에요. 썸네일의 핵심은 시선을 끄는 이미지와 함께 명확한 메시지를 전달하는 카피라이팅인데, AI가 꼬불꼬불한 외계어만 그려 놓으니 결국 사용자가 포토샵으로 다시 텍스트 작업을 해야 하는 번거로움이 있었죠. 아, 정말 번거로웠어요!\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이 근본적인 문제를 해결했습니다. 이 앱에는 구글의 최신 모델인 'Gemini Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)'가 탑재되어 있어요. 이 모델은 단순히 그림을 잘 그리는 것을 넘어, 이미지 내에 정확한 텍스트를 렌더링하는 혁신적인 능력을 갖췄습니다. 그리고 놀랍게도, 단순한 이미지 생성을 넘어 사용자의 의도를 파악하고 '기획(Strategy)'까지 할 수 있는 지능적인 AI로 진화했습니다.\n개발팀은 \"디자이너의 뇌(Brain)와 손(Hand)을 합치자\"는 목표로, 썸네일 기획부터 제작, 그리고 최종 보정까지 전 과정을 자동화하기 위해 이 앱을 만들었다고 해요. 2025년 현재, 이런 기능을 가진 AI는 정말 드물다고 생각합니다.\n'썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'의 핵심 기능들 ✨\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이제 여러분만의 '수석 아트 디렉터'가 되어줄 거예요. 마치 전담 디자이너를 둔 것처럼 든든하겠죠? 어떤 놀라운 기능들이 있는지 자세히 살펴볼까요?\n\n\n\n이중 전략 제안 (Dual Track Strategy): AI가 하나의 정답만을 강요하지 않습니다. 시청자의 시선을 끄는 방식에도 여러 가지가 있다는 것을 아니까요. Option A(직관/팩트형)와 Option B(호기심/어그로형) 두 가지 전략을 동시에 제안하여, 크리에이터가 영상의 성격과 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 최적의 썸네일을 선택할 수 있도록 폭넓은 선택지를 제공합니다.\n타겟 오디언스 분석: 10대, 2040 직장인, 5060 시니어 등 영상의 타겟층을 설정하면, AI가 해당 오디언스가 선호하는 폰트 크기, 색상 대비, 디자인 스타일을 자동으로 적용해줍니다. 이 기능은 정말 핵심적이에요. 아무리 잘 만들어도 타겟이 외면하면 소용없으니까요!\n완벽한 텍스트 렌더링: 기존 AI의 가장 큰 단점이었던 '글자' 문제를 완벽하게 해결했습니다. 별도의 편집 툴 없이, 이미지 생성 시점에 썸네일 문구가 완벽하게 합성되어 나옵니다. 이제 꼬불꼬불한 외계어와는 작별입니다!\n일관된 캐릭터 유지: 채널의 개성을 살리는 데 중요한 요소 중 하나가 바로 일관성입니다. 성별, 나이, 인종 등 페르소나를 설정하면, AI가 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 고정 캐릭터를 썸네일에 계속 유지해 줍니다. 얼굴 없는 채널이라면 물론 이 부분은 건너뛸 수 있고요.\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro, 100% 활용 가이드  \n전문적인 지식이 없어도 괜찮아요. 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 누구나 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 제가 직접 해보니, 정말 몇 번의 클릭만으로 전문가 수준의 썸네일을 만들 수 있더라고요. 자, 그럼 함께 사용법을 알아볼까요?\nSTEP 1. 주제 입력 및 대본 분석\n가장 먼저, 만들고 싶은 영상의 주제를 한 줄로 간단하게 입력하거나, 이미 작성된 영상 대본 파일(.txt)을 그대로 업로드해 보세요. AI가 대본 내용을 꼼꼼히 분석하여, 시청자의 클릭을 가장 강력하게 유도할 수 있는 핵심 키워드와 문구를 자동으로 추출해냅니다. 이 단계에서부터 AI의 기획력이 빛을 발한답니다.\nSTEP 2. 캐릭터 설정 (페르소나)\n내 채널의 주인공, 즉 페르소나를 설정하는 단계입니다. \"20대 한국인 여성 유튜버\", \"귀여운 고양이 캐릭터\", \"중년 남성 전문가\" 등 구체적으로 설정할수록 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 일관성 있고 매력적인 썸네일이 만들어집니다. 만약 얼굴 없는 채널을 운영하신다면 이 단계를 건너뛰어도 무방해요.\nSTEP 3. 타겟 오디언스 선택\n이 영상은 누가 보게 될까요? 타겟 오디언스를 명확히 설정하는 것은 매우 중요합니다.\n10대: 화려한 네온 효과, 강렬한 색상, 도파민을 터뜨리는 듯한 역동적인 스타일\n시니어: 검정 배경에 눈에 띄는 노란 글씨, 압도적인 가독성을 최우선으로 하는 디자인\n2040 직장인: 깔끔하고 세련된 디자인, 정보 전달에 효율적인 레이아웃 등\n타겟에 맞춰 썸네일 스타일을 자동으로 최적화해주니, 클릭률 상승에 정말 큰 도움이 됩니다.\nSTEP 4. 전략 확인 및 생성\n이제 AI가 제안한 A안(직관/팩트형)과 B안(호기심/어그로형)의 카피라이팅과 대략적인 시안을 확인해 보세요. 마음에 드는 안이 있다면 '생성하기' 버튼을 한 번만 클릭하면 됩니다. 그러면 고화질 썸네일 2장이 동시에 만들어집니다. 채널의 브랜딩을 위해 테두리 스타일이나 채널명 워터마크도 쉽게 추가할 수 있어서 편리했어요.\n\n\n⚠️ 주의: AI가 제안하는 카피라이팅은 강력한 클릭 유도에 초점을 맞추지만, 채널의 톤앤매너와 영상 내용의 진정성을 해치지 않는 범위 내에서 신중하게 선택하는 것이 중요합니다. 너무 과도한 어그로는 장기적인 채널 성장에 독이 될 수도 있다는 점, 기억해 주세요!\nSTEP 5. 수정 및 다운로드\n혹시 결과물이 완벽하지 않다고 느껴지나요? 걱정 마세요! \"표정을 더 놀라게 해줘\", \"글씨 색을 빨간색으로 바꿔줘\"처럼 채팅하듯 자연어로 입력하면 부분 수정(Inpainting)이 가능합니다. AI가 사용자의 요청을 정확히 파악하고 반영해 주니, 마치 옆에 디자이너가 있는 것 같았어요. 최종적으로 만족스러운 이미지가 완성되면 JPG 파일로 즉시 다운로드하여 유튜브 스튜디오에 업로드하면 끝! 정말 간편하죠?\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 썸네일 기획부터 디자인까지 원스톱으로 처리합니다.\n2. 구글 Gemini 3 Pro 기반으로, 이미지 내 정확한 텍스트 렌더링이 가능해요.\n3. 타겟 오디언스별 맞춤 전략과 이중 전략 제안으로 최적의 썸네일을 찾아줍니다.\n4. 간편한 사용법과 AI 채팅 기반의 부분 수정으로 누구나 전문가처럼 활용할 수 있어요.\n이제 썸네일 걱정은 그만! 콘텐츠에만 집중할 시간입니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 무료인가요?\nA1: 현재 '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'는 유료 구독 서비스로 운영되고 있습니다. 하지만 디자이너 고용 비용이나 기타 유료 이미지 툴 비용에 비하면 매우 합리적인 가격으로 책정되어 있으며, 무료 체험 기간을 제공하기도 합니다. 자세한 요금제는 공식 웹사이트에서 확인해 보세요.\nQ2: 모든 종류의 유튜브 채널에 적용 가능한가요?\nA2: 네, 엔터테인먼트, 교육, 브이로그, 정보성 채널 등 거의 모든 종류의 유튜브 채널에 적용 가능합니다.

        "contentSnippet": "좋은 제품을 어렵게 소싱했지만, '팔리는' 상세페이지 제작에 매번 발목 잡히셨나요? 이제 더 이상 디자인과 카피라이팅 때문에 밤샘 고민할 필요 없습니다. AI 기술의 발전은 쿠팡, 스마트스토어 셀러들에게 상세페이지 제작의 새로운 지평을 열어주었죠. 오늘 이 글에서는 사진 한 장만으로 전문 MD와 디자이너가 만든 듯한 고퀄리티 상세페이지를 1분 만에 완성해주는 마법 같은 AI 솔루션을 소개해 드립니다.\n\n\nAI가 생성한 고품질 상세페이지를 태블릿으로 확인하며 만족하는 셀러의 모습. 이커머스 작업 효율성을 보여주는 미래지향적 이미지.\n\"물건은 정말 좋은데, 상세페이지 만들 시간이 도저히 없어서….\" 아마 많은 초보 셀러와 1인 창업가분들이 입버릇처럼 하는 말이 아닐까 싶어요. 저도 과거에 이런 고민 때문에 밤잠을 설치던 기억이 납니다. 포토샵은 너무 어렵고, 그렇다고 외주를 맡기자니 건당 수십만 원에 달하는 비용이 정말 큰 부담으로 다가오죠.\n \n제품 사입부터 배송, 고객 응대까지 하루 24시간이 모자란데, 여기에 디자인과 카피라이팅까지 신경 쓰기란 정말 쉽지 않은 일이죠. 저도 겪어봐서 잘 압니다. 하지만 이커머스 시장에서 상세페이지는 단순한 정보 전달을 넘어, 고객의 구매를 유도하는 '영업사원'과도 같은 역할을 합니다. 잘 만들어진 상세페이지 하나가 매출을 좌우한다고 해도 과언이 아니에요.\n오늘 소개해 드릴 ShopGenie AI는 바로 이런 셀러분들의 깊은 고민에서 출발했습니다. 사진 한 장과 간단한 설명만 있으면, 마치 전문 MD가 기획하고 전문 디자이너가 작업한 것처럼 보이는 고퀄리티 상세페이지를 자동으로 만들어주는, 말 그대로 '마법 같은' 도구죠. 이제 시간과 비용 걱정 없이 오직 좋은 제품을 소싱하는 데만 집중할 수 있게 될 겁니다.\n  탄생 배경: \"누구나 1등 셀러가 될 수 있도록\"\n현재 이커머스 시장은 그야말로 전쟁터라고 해도 지나치지 않습니다. 매일같이 수많은 신제품과 새로운 셀러들이 쏟아져 나오죠. 아무리 좋은 제품이라도 고객의 눈길을 단번에 사로잡지 못하면, 그 제품은 결국 수많은 경쟁 제품 속에서 잊히고 맙니다. 대기업이야 전문 스튜디오 촬영에 비싼 카피라이터를 고용할 수 있지만, 소상공인에게는 사실상 불가능에 가까운 일이었죠. 솔직히 저도 늘 부러워만 했습니다.\n이런 현실 속에서 \"AI 기술을 활용해 누구나 '팔리는 페이지'를 만들 수 있다면 어떨까?\"라는 질문이 ShopGenie AI의 시작점이 되었습니다. 2025년 현재, 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 Gemini 2.5 Flash와 Gemini 3 Pro를 탑재하여, 텍스트 생성부터 고화질 이미지 렌더링까지 한 번에 해결하는 올인원 솔루션으로 진화했죠. 복잡한 디자인 툴을 배우거나 비싼 외주에 의존할 필요 없이, 클릭 몇 번으로 전문가 수준의 결과물을 얻는 것이 핵심 목표입니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n  왜 ShopGenie AI가 필요한가요?\n많은 셀러분들이 상세페이지 제작에 엄청난 시간과 비용을 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 외주 업체에 맡기면 건당 수만 원에서 수십만 원은 기본이고, 작은 수정 하나에도 며칠씩 소요되곤 했죠. 그런데 ShopGenie AI는 이 모든 과정을 획기적으로 바꿔놓았습니다. 왜 지금 당신에게 이 AI 솔루션이 절실한지, 구체적인 이유들을 살펴볼까요?\n\n\n\n✅ 비용과 시간의 획기적인 절약: 외주 비용 0원! 수정 대기 시간 0! ShopGenie AI는 단 1~2분 만에 상세페이지 하나를 뚝딱 만들어냅니다. 기존에 며칠씩 걸리던 작업을 점심시간에 잠깐 투자하는 것만으로도 충분하죠. 저도 처음엔 믿기지 않았어요.\n✅ '똥손'도 '금손'으로! 고퀄리티 이미지 생성: 비싼 스튜디오 촬영은 이제 옛말입니다. 핸드폰으로 대충 찍은 누끼 사진도 괜찮습니다. AI가 제품에 가장 잘 어울리는 조명, 배경, 그림자를 완벽하게 재구성하여 전문 스튜디오에서 촬영한 듯한 4K 고화질 연출컷으로 바꿔줍니다. 상세페이지의 퀄리티가 확 달라지는 것을 체감할 수 있을 겁니다.\n✅ 플랫폼별 맞춤 최적화: 쿠팡은 '세로형 스크롤', 네이버 스마트스토어는 '블로그형' 등 플랫폼마다 고객이 선호하고 검색 엔진이 좋아하는 상세페이지 양식이 제각각입니다. ShopGenie AI는 타겟 플랫폼을 선택하면 그 규정에 딱 맞는 구조와 이미지 개수(예: 쿠팡은 12장 이상, 네이버는 9장 이상)를 자동으로 맞춰줍니다. 번거롭게 수동으로 조절할 필요가 전혀 없는 거죠.\n\n\n  핵심 팁: 상세페이지는 단순한 제품 소개가 아니라, 고객의 '문제 해결'에 초점을 맞춰야 합니다. ShopGenie AI는 이런 고객 중심의 접근을 도와주는 강력한 도구라는 점을 잊지 마세요!\n✨ ShopGenie AI 개요: 단순한 툴을 넘어선 전략적 파트너\n간혹 ShopGenie AI를 단순한 이미지 생성기로 오해하는 분들이 있습니다. 하지만 저는 이 AI 솔루션을 '스마트한 팀원'이라고 부르고 싶어요. 기획자, 카피라이터, 디자이너의 역할을 동시에 수행하며 셀러의 비즈니스 성장을 돕는 올인원 도구이기 때문이죠. 특히 다음과 같은 기능들은 정말 인상 깊습니다.\n✒️ 전문 MD급 카피라이팅: 후킹 메시지는 기본이고, 고객의 문제점(Pain Point)을 날카롭게 지적하며 솔루션을 제시하는 논리적인 설득 구조, 스펙 설명, 그리고 자주 묻는 질문(FAQ)까지! 전문 MD가 쓴 듯한 완벽한 카피라이팅을 자동으로 완성해줍니다.\n ️ 다양한 장면 연출: 제품만 덩그러니 있는, 흔해 빠진 사진은 이제 그만! AI가 제품을 사용하는 실제 장면(Lifestyle), 특정 기능을 강조하는 클로즈업 컷(Close-up), 계절별 이벤트 배너 등을 자동으로 생성하여 고객의 상상력을 자극합니다.\n✍️ AI 매직 에디터: 이미지가 마음에 들지 않아도 걱정 마세요. 마치 친구에게 채팅하듯 \"배경을 고급 대리석으로 바꿔줘\", \"조명을 더 밝게 해줘\"라고 입력하면 이미지가 즉시 수정됩니다. 이 기능은 정말이지 저의 디자인 고민을 단숨에 해결해줬습니다.\n\n\n⚠️ 주의 사항: 아무리 AI가 뛰어나더라도, 제품의 핵심 가치와 타겟 고객을 명확히 이해하고 입력하는 것이 중요합니다. AI는 당신이 제공한 정보 위에서 최고의 결과물을 만들어낸다는 점을 기억하세요!\n⚙️ 사용법: 4단계로 끝내는 '팔리는' 상세페이지\n혹시 사용법이 복잡할까 봐 걱정되시나요? 저도 그랬는데, 막상 써보니 정말 놀라울 정도로 간단했습니다. 단 4단계만 거치면 전문가 수준의 상세페이지가 완성됩니다.\nSTEP 1. 정보 입력: 제품명, 가격, 간단한 특징을 입력하세요. 만약 제품 설명이 어렵다면 '정보 자동검색' 버튼을 눌러보세요. AI가 구글 검색을 통해 제품 정보를 찾아 자동으로 채워줍니다. 가지고 있는 PDF 설명서가 있다면 업로드만 해도 AI가 분석을 끝내주니, 이보다 더 편할 수는 없겠죠?\nSTEP 2. 사진 업로드 & 옵션 선택: 제품 사진(가능하면 누끼컷 권장)을 업로드하고, 판매할 플랫폼(쿠팡/스마트스토어)과 원하는 AI 모델(빠른 속도/고화질)을 선택합니다.\nSTEP 3. 생성하기: '상세페이지 생성하기' 버튼을 누르고 잠시만 기다리세요. AI가 제품을 심층적으로 분석하여 매력적인 문구와 고퀄리티 이미지를 마치 마법처럼 쏟아냅니다.\nSTEP 4. 편집 및 저장: 완성된 페이지를 미리보기로 확인하세요. 텍스트가 마음에 안 들면 \"조금 더 감성적으로 바꿔줘\"라고 요청하고, 이미지가 아쉽다면 매직 에디터로 수정하면 됩니다. 완벽하다면 '전체 저장(JPG)' 또는 '이미지 개별 다운로드(ZIP)'를 눌러 쇼핑몰에 바로 업로드하면 끝! 정말 쉽고 빠르죠?\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 상세페이지 제작 시간과 비용 획기적 절감: 몇 분 만에 전문가 수준의 페이지 완성, 외주 비용 제로.\n✅ '똥손'도 고퀄리티 이미지 생성: AI가 배경, 조명, 그림자까지 완벽 재구성하여 4K 연출컷 제공.\n✅ 플랫폼별 맞춤 최적화 기능: 쿠팡, 스마트스토어 등 플랫폼별 최적화된 구조와 이미지 개수 자동 설정.\n✅ 올인원 AI 솔루션: MD급 카피라이팅, 다양한 장면 연출, AI 매직 에디터로 수정까지 한 번에.\n이 4가지 핵심 가치는 당신의 이커머스 비즈니스를 한 단계 더 성장시킬 강력한 엔진이 될 것입니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: ShopGenie AI를 사용하면 정말 디자인을 몰라도 상세페이지를 만들 수 있나요?\nA1: 네, 물론입니다!

        "contentSnippet": "AI와의 소통 방식이 진화하고 있습니다. 영어 프롬프트도 좋지만, 마크다운 문법을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 정확하고 원하는 형식으로 답변하게 만들 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 효율적인 AI 활용을 위한 마크다운 프롬프트의 모든 것을 친근하고 실용적인 예시와 함께 알려드릴게요!\n  AI와 더 똑똑하게 대화하는 비법, 왜 마크다운일까요?\n\n\n  AI는 우리 일상과 업무에 깊숙이 스며들었어요. 다들 챗GPT 같은 인공지능 도구들과 한 번쯤은 대화해보셨을 텐데요. 그런데 혹시 이런 경험 없으신가요? 꽤 긴 프롬프트를 입력했는데, AI가 엉뚱한 방향으로 답변하거나, 아니면 제가 원하는 형식과는 전혀 다른 결과물을 내놓을 때 말이에요. 정말이지 답답할 때가 한두 번이 아니었죠. 제 경험상 처음엔 단순히 영어로 프롬프트를 길게, 자세하게 쓰면 되는 줄 알았어요. 하지만 시간이 지날수록 무언가 더 중요한 것이 있다는 걸 깨닫게 되더라고요.\n사실, AI와 효과적으로 소통하는 데에는 언어 선택만큼이나 '구조'가 중요해요. AI는 우리가 던지는 문장들을 분석해서 의미를 파악하지만, 그 의미가 어떤 '형식'으로 이루어져야 하는지는 명확히 알려주지 않으면 헤맬 때가 많거든요. 이때 빛을 발하는 것이 바로 마크다운 문법입니다. 마치 설계도면처럼 AI에게 정확한 구조를 제시해서, 우리가 원하는 대로 정보를 구성하고 답변하게 만드는 거죠.\n  마크다운, AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'인 이유\n제가 왜 마크다운을 AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'라고 부르는지 궁금하시죠? 몇 가지 핵심적인 이유가 있어요. 단순히 영어를 잘 쓰는 것을 넘어서, 마크다운을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 똑똑해지고, 여러분의 작업 효율은 비약적으로 상승합니다.\n명확한 구조 전달: 마크다운은 헤더, 목록, 코드 블록, 표 등 정해진 문법으로 텍스트의 구조를 명확하게 정의할 수 있어요. AI는 이 구조를 보고 여러분이 원하는 답변의 형태를 정확하게 파악하게 됩니다.\n정보 손실 최소화: 모호하거나 중의적인 표현을 줄이고, 정보의 계층을 분명히 함으로써 AI가 프롬프트를 오해할 가능성을 현저히 낮춥니다.\n일관된 출력: 한 번 마크다운 문법으로 형식을 지정해두면, AI는 항상 그 형식에 맞춰 답변을 생성합니다. 반복적인 작업을 할 때, 수동으로 편집하는 시간을 크게 절약할 수 있어요.\n효율적인 작업: 특히 보고서 초안, 코드 스니펫 요청, 자료 요약 등 구조화된 정보가 필요한 경우, 마크다운은 개발자, 작가, 기획자 등 모든 직군에서 생산성을 폭발적으로 높여줍니다.\n  팁: 마크다운은 복잡한 프로그래밍 언어가 아니에요! 몇 가지 규칙만 알면 누구나 쉽게 활용할 수 있답니다. HTML처럼 복잡한 태그를 외울 필요도 없어서 정말 간편하죠.\n  초보자도 쉽게 따라 하는 마크다운 프롬프트 작성법\n그럼 이제 실전으로 들어가 볼까요? 마크다운 문법, 생각보다 정말 쉬워요. 몇 가지만 기억하면 됩니다. 제가 가장 많이 사용하는 핵심 문법들을 소개해 드릴게요.\n1. 헤더 (제목)\n문서의 제목이나 소제목을 만들 때 사용해요. `#`의 개수로 크기를 조절합니다.\n# 대제목\n## 중제목\n### 소제목\n2. 목록 (리스트)\n순서가 없는 목록은 `-`나 `*`로, 순서 있는 목록은 숫자로 시작합니다. 들여쓰기로 하위 목록을 만들 수 있어요.\n- 첫 번째 항목\n* 두 번째 항목\n1. 순서 있는 첫 번째\n  2. 하위 항목\n3. 코드 블록\n코드나 특정 텍스트를 강조하고 싶을 때 사용해요. 백틱(`) 세 개로 감싸면 됩니다.\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, AI!\")\n```\n4. 굵게/기울게\n텍스트를 굵게 하려면 `**`로, 기울게 하려면 `*`로 감싸세요.\n**굵은 글씨** -> 굵은 글씨\n*기울인 글씨* -> 기울인 글씨\n5. 표 (Table)\n데이터를 구조적으로 표현하는 데 유용해요. 생각보다 어렵지 않습니다!\n문법\n설명\n예시\n\n\n\n\n#\n헤더(제목)\n# 메인 제목\n\n\n- / *\n순서 없는 목록\n- 항목 1\n\n\n1.\n순서 있는 목록\n1. 첫째\n\n\n```\n코드 블록\n```코드```\n\n\n** / *\n굵게 / 기울게\n**강조**\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의: 지나치게 복잡한 마크다운은 오히려 AI를 혼란스럽게 할 수 있어요. 핵심적인 구조 위주로 간단하게 사용하는 것이 중요합니다. 너무 많은 문법을 한 번에 쓰려고 하지 마세요!\n  실제 사례로 보는 마크다운 프롬프트의 위력\n이론만으로는 와닿지 않으실 수도 있어요. 그래서 제가 직접 AI에게 마크다운 문법을 활용해서 프롬프트를 작성해본 몇 가지 사례를 보여드릴까 해요. 정말 놀라울 정도로 결과물의 질이 달라지는 걸 체감하실 겁니다.\n사례 1: 보고서 초안 작성 요청\n단순히 \"AI 기술 동향에 대한 보고서 초안을 써줘\"라고 요청했을 때와, 아래처럼 마크다운으로 구조를 명확히 제시했을 때의 결과는 하늘과 땅 차이였습니다. AI는 제가 원하는 목차와 내용 구성을 정확히 파악하고 깔끔하게 작성해 주더라고요.\n# 2025년 AI 기술 동향 보고서 초안\n\n## 1. 서론: AI 기술의 현재와 미래\n\n## 2. 주요 기술 동향\n### 2.1. 생성형 AI의 발전\n### 2.2. 소형 LLM의 등장\n### 2.3. 멀티모달 AI의 확장\n\n## 3. 산업별 적용 사례\n### 3.1. 제조 산업\n### 3.2. 의료 산업\n### 3.3. 금융 산업\n\n## 4. 결론 및 제언\n사례 2: 아이디어 브레인스토밍\n새로운 웹사이트 디자인 아이디어를 얻고 싶을 때, 단순히 \"웹사이트 디자인 아이디어 줘\"라고 하는 대신, 다음과 같이 리스트 형태로 요청했어요. 그랬더니 AI가 각 카테고리별로 핵심 아이디어를 깔끔하게 정리해 줘서 아이디어 구체화에 엄청난 도움이 되었습니다.\n다음 주제에 대해 5가지 혁신적인 웹사이트 디자인 아이디어를 제안해주세요.\n\n- 사용자 경험 (UX) 측면\n- 시각적 디자인 (UI) 측면\n- 기술적 구현 측면\n- 마케팅 활용 측면\n- 지속 가능성 측면\n사례 3: 코드 설명 요청\n특정 코드에 대한 설명을 요청할 때도 마크다운은 정말 유용해요. 코드를 코드 블록으로 감싸서 전달하면, AI가 해당 코드를 정확히 인식하고 구문별 설명, 기능 요약 등을 체계적으로 제공해 줍니다. 개발자라면 이 기능이 얼마나 강력한지 바로 이해하실 거예요.\n\n\n다음 Python 코드를 설명해주세요.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# 예시 사용\nfor num in fibonacci(10):\n    print(num)\n```\n\n- 이 함수는 무엇을 하는 함수인가요?\n- 각 줄의 기능은 무엇인가요?\n- 제너레이터(yield)를 사용한 이유는 무엇인가요?\n✨ AI 시대, 마크다운은 선택이 아닌 필수\n생각해보면, 우리는 AI와 대화할 때 마치 사람과 대화하듯 편하게 접근하곤 해요. 물론 기본적인 대화는 그것만으로도 충분하죠. 하지만 좀 더 전문적이고, 구체적이며, 원하는 형식의 결과물을 얻고 싶다면? 마크다운 문법은 이제 선택이 아니라 필수적인 소통 도구라고 자신 있게 말씀드릴 수 있습니다.\n2025년 현재, AI 기술은 계속해서 발전하고 있지만, 우리의 '프롬프트' 역시 그만큼 진화해야 해요. 마크다운은 AI의 이해도를 높여주고, 우리의 생산성을 극대화하며, 궁극적으로는 AI를 더욱 강력한 파트너로 만들어 줄 겁니다. 여러분도 오늘부터 AI와 대화할 때 마크다운 문법을 적극적으로 활용해보세요! 분명히 새로운 AI 활용의 지평이 열릴 거예요.\n  핵심 요약\nAI와 효과적인 대화의 핵심은 '명확한 구조'입니다.\n마크다운은 AI가 정보를 정확히 이해하고 원하는 형식으로 출력하게 돕는 강력한 도구입니다.\n헤더, 리스트, 코드블록 등 몇 가지 기본 문법만 알아도 활용도가 엄청나요.\n단순한 영어 대화보다 훨씬 효율적이며, AI 작업의 질을 혁신적으로 높여줍니다.\nAI와의 소통, 이제 더 이상 감에 의존하지 마세요. 마크다운으로 스마트하게!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: 마크다운 문법을 꼭 사용해야 하나요?\nA: 필수는 아니지만, AI로부터 원하는 형식과 내용의 답변을 얻으려면 마크다운 사용을 강력히 추천해요. 특히 복잡하거나 구조화된 정보를 요청할 때 그 효과가 극대화됩니다.\nQ: 어떤 AI 모델에 마크다운 프롬프트가 잘 작동하나요?\nA: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 등 대부분의 주요 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)은 마크다운 문법을 잘 이해하고 처리하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 오히려 마크다운을 통해 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있어요.\nQ: 마크다운을 너무 많이 사용하면 AI가 혼란스러워하진 않을까요?\nA: 아니요, 오히려 명확한 구조를 제공하여 혼란을 줄여줍니다. 다만, 지나치게 복잡하거나 불필요한 문법을 남용하는 것은 피하는 것이 좋습니다. 핵심 정보를 전달하는 데 필요한 만큼만 활용하세요.\n\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n      \"mainEntity\": [\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"마크다운 문법을 꼭 사용해야 하나요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"필수는 아니지만, AI로부터 원하는 형식과 내용의 답변을 얻으려면 마크다운 사용을 강력히 추천해요. 특히 복잡하거나 구조화된 정보를 요청할 때 그 효과가 극대화됩니다.\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"어떤 AI 모델에 마크다운 프롬프트가 잘 작동하나요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 등 대부분의 주요 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)은 마크다운 문법을 잘 이해하고 처리하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 오히려 마크다운을 통해 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있어요.\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"마크다운을 너무 많이 사용하면 AI가 혼란스러워하진 않을까요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"아니요, 오히려 명확한 구조를 제공하여 혼란을 줄여줍니다. 다만, 지나치게 복잡하거나 불필요한 문법을 남용하는 것은 피하는 것이 좋습니다. 핵심 정보를 전달하는 데 필요한 만큼만 활용하세요.\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }",

Nano Banana Pro와 Sora 2.0/VEO 3.1의 환상적인 조합으로 탄생한 이 혁신적인 워크플로우를 지금 바로 만나보세요.\n  놀랍지 않나요? 30분 걸리던 영상 제작이 단 1분 만에!\n\n\n솔직히 처음 이 이야기를 들었을 때 저도 깜짝 놀랐습니다. 불과 얼마 전까지만 해도 15초 분량의 영상을 만들기 위해선 프레임을 일일이 추출하고, 중간 프레임을 생성하며 사운드까지 수작업으로 입히는 등 꽤나 지난한 과정을 거쳐야 했거든요. 그런데 지금은 그 모든 과정이 단 몇 번의 클릭으로 끝난다는 겁니다. 특히 X에서 엄청난 화제를 모았던 Underwood의 혁신적인 AI 스토리보드 시스템은 이런 변화를 가능하게 했어요.\n핵심은 바로 Nano Banana Pro와 Sora 2.0 (또는 VEO 3.1)의 조합입니다. 고품질의 이미지를 만들어내는 Nano Banana Pro로 단 한 장의 이미지를 생성하고, 이를 Sora 2.0이나 VEO 3.1에 넣으면 놀랍도록 자연스러운 영상으로 확장되죠. 심지어 사운드 디자인까지 자동으로 처리해주니, 예전처럼 복잡한 편집 단계는 이제 정말 옛말이 되어버렸습니다.\n  AI 스토리보드 시스템의 마법: 이미지 생성(Nano Banana Pro) → 영상 확장 및 사운드 자동 생성(Sora 2.0/VEO 3.1) = 초고속 영상 제작! ✨\n  Underwood의 '그' 복잡한 프롬프트, 완벽 분석!\nUnderwood가 X에 공개했던 원본 프롬프트는 사실 굉장히 전문적이고 복잡했습니다. 수백 줄에 달하는 영화 문법, 카메라 워킹, 조명 설정 등이 총망라되어 있었죠. 이 프롬프트의 구조를 자세히 들여다보면 그야말로 '영화 감독' 수준의 지식이 필요함을 알 수 있습니다.\nUnderwood 원본 프롬프트의 핵심 요소\n역할 정의: 당신은 트레일러 감독이자 촬영 감독이자 스토리보드 아티스트다. 이미지 하나를 영화적 시퀀스로 확장하고, AI 비디오용 키프레임을 출력하라.\n5가지 절대 규칙:\n\n모든 피사체를 정확히 분석 (누가, 어디, 뭘 하는지).\n추측 금지, 보이는 것만 묘사.\n완벽한 일관성 (같은 의상, 환경, 조명. 액션과 표정만 변화).\n현실적 피사계 심도 (와이드는 깊게, 클로즈업은 얕게).\n새로운 요소 추가 금지 (긴장감은 화면 밖에서, 그림자, 소리, 시선으로 암시).\n4단계 프로세스:\n\n1단계, 장면 분석: 피사체 분석 및 시각적 고정점 정의.\n2단계, 테마와 스토리: 테마 정의, 도입, 상승, 전환, 클라이맥스 감정 아크 설계.\n3단계, 영화적 접근: 샷 전략, 카메라 움직임, 렌즈, 조명 결정.\n4단계, 키프레임 디자인: 9~12개 프레임 디자인 (번호, 시간, 샷 타입, 구도, 액션, 카메라, 렌즈, 조명, 사운드 등 상세 정의). 와이드, 클로즈업, 익스트림 클로즈업, 파워 앵글 각 1개 필수.\n5단계, Contact Sheet 출력: 모든 키프레임을 3x3 그리드로 만들어 각 패널에 번호, 샷 타입, 시간 라벨 부착.\n어떠세요? 이 프롬프트를 원본 그대로 사용하기란 정말 쉽지 않겠죠? 전문 영상 제작자가 아니라면 엄두도 내기 어려울 정도의 복잡성과 전문성을 요구합니다. 하지만 걱정 마세요! 바로 이 복잡한 과정을 누구나 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록 앱으로 구현한 것이 바로 '시네마틱 스토리보드 AI'입니다.\n  이제는 버튼 몇 번으로 끝!

(카탈루냐 광장에서 도보 5 ~ 10분 사이)\n  \n우선 호텔이 아니라 호스텔이라 그런지 입구부터 1층도 아니고, 엘레베이터도 없고 저 긴 계단을 캐리어를 끌고 올라가야한다.\n맨처음에는 아무런 안내도 없어서 여기가 맞나?? 싶어서 반신반의 하면서 올라갔다.\n데스크에는 사람이 없을 때가 태반인데 그거 때문인가 나한테 언제 체크인하는지 물어봤는데 그 시간에만 자리를 지키고 나머지 시간에는 농땡이를 피우는 것 같았다.\n그리고 바르셀로나 같은 경우에 숙소에 관광세(숙소 등급 * 몇박 묵는지에 따라 다름)까지 내야해서 관광세로 €10.5 (17,825원)을 현장에서 결제해야했다. (다행히 카드 결제 가능)\n    \n그리고 가장 경악했던 게 화장실이 너무 좁아서 똥을 쌀 때면 벽과 거의 마주봐야하고 그리고 온수가 안 나온다는 것이었다.\n데스크에 문의해봐도 보일러가 고장이 난 거 같다고만 말하고 내가 또 영어도 잘 안 되고, 상대방도 영어를 잘 못해서 언어가 통하지 않아서 있는동안 샤워는 못하고 그냥 머리만 찬물로 감았다.\n호스텔이라 그런지 별로 정감 가지 않는 숙소였고, 근데 여기는 물가도 높고 관광객이 많아서 그런지 좀만 좋은 호텔로 가면 3박에 90만원 정도도 나와서 큰 고민 없이 이 호스텔로 예약한 건데 후회가 됐다.\n보일러가 고장나지 않았는지 확인하고 고장났다면 절대절대 예약하지 않는 걸 추천한다.\n구글 리뷰를 보면 1점 테러도 많은 걸 보면 여기는 정말정말 비추 한다.\n\n카탈루냐 광장 근처로 가니 버스킹을 하는 사람들이 보였는데 이 추운 날씨에 반팔이라니 그 열정이 엄청났다. \n그리고 너무 배고파서 이른 저녁을 먹으려고 한식당을 뒤지다보니 하나 식당이라고 나름 유명한 한식당이 나왔다.  \n  \n근데 가니까 문이 닫혀있는 게 아닌가?? 구글에도 Closed라고 돼있긴 했지만 오늘 저녁 장사를 하는 걸 봤기 때문에 혹시나 하는 마음에 같는데 역시나 닫혀있던 것이었다.\n찾아보니 점심 장사는 4시 반에 끝나고 저녁 장사는 7시 반에 한다고 돼있었다.\n그러면 브레이크 타임이라는 의미인데 아예 불까지 꺼져있는 게 이해가 안 갔다.\n챗GPT한테 물어보니 한국처럼 가게는 열어두고 휴식/저녁장사 준비를 하는 게 아니라 진짜로 퇴근했다가 다시 출근하는 거라고 했다.\n그리고 왜 이렇게 늦게 저녁장사를 시작하냐고 물어보니 뭐 얘네가 원래 타임존도 +00:00이었는데 과거에 중앙 유럽 표준시(CET)로 한시간 땡기면서 원래 시간대보다 한시간 빠르게 살고 있다고 한다.\n그래서 그렇게 저녁을 늦게 먹는 거라고 한다.\n내가 갔을 때가 5시 쯤이어서 2시간 반을 돌아댕겨야 했다. (밖이 너무 추웠는데 이 때 돌아다니면 안 됐었을 것 같다.)\n  \n돌아다니다 보니 사람들이 줄지어 서있길래 뭔가 싶어서 찾아보니 츄러스 맛집 Xurreria Laietana라고 한다.\n나는 좀이따 저녁으로 한식을 맛있게 먹어야하니 먹고 싶은 걸 참았다.  \n  \n그리고 쓰레기통 주변에 쓰레기가 너무 지저분하게 널브러져있어서 여기는 제대로 청소를 안 하나? 싶었다.\n        \n그리고 튀르키예에서 이미 많이 봐서 유럽풍 건물에는 큰 감흥이 없었지만, 그래도 바르셀로나 분위기가 나는 건물이나 풍경이 많아서 볼만했다.  \n    \n그리고 락을 주제로 한 기념품 가게도 보여서 둘러볼만 했다.  \n        \n그리고 라 람블라 거리 근처에 있는 라 보케리아 시장에서도 이것 저것 파는 걸 보는 묘미가 있었다.  \n  \n대충 관광을 마치고 7시 반경에 다시 하나식당으로 가니 문이 열려있었다.\n이 얼마만에 먹는 한식인가… 혼자 가니 눈치보여서 순두부찌개 + 제육볶음 두개를 시켜서 과식을 하였다.\n처음에는 순두부찌개가 얼큰한 것처럼 느껴졌다가 먹다보니 그냥 그랬고, 제육볶음도 좀 달아서 그저 그랬다.\n그래도 스페인에서 이정도 한식을 누릴 수 있다는 게 참 좋았고, 근데 가격은 사악했다. (€32.4로 54,903원을 냈다.)\n한끼에 5만 4천원이라니… 엄청난 플렉스를 했다고 생각을 했고 그래도 메뉴 두개를 시켰고 여기 물가를 고려하면 나름 합당하다고는 생각했다.  \n\n  \n숙소로 돌아오는 길에 카탈루냐 광장의 분수대를 볼 수 있었다.  \n  \n그리고 스페인에서 자라를 보았는데 자라가 스페인의 브랜드인 건 처음 알았다.\n그래서 한국 대비 옷이 싸다고 해서 따뜻한 옷이나 하나 살까… 고민하다가 귀찮아서 그냥 숙소로 가서 잤다.\n2일차 (구엘 공원 + 응급실)\n2일차에는 새벽에 깨서 화장실을 가는데 뭔가 좀 어지럽다는 느낌이 들었다.\n근데 뭐 가끔씩 어지럼증을 약하게 느낄 때가 있곤 하다보니 뭐 별일이 아닌 줄 알았다.  \n  \n아침이 되어 구엘 공원으로 가기 위해 지하철을 타러 갔다.\n스크린도어가 없는 지하철역은 오랜만에 가다보니 뭔가 무서웠다.\n  \n그리고 교통카드도 코팅된 종이를 사용해서 찍는 게 신기했다. 일반적인 플라스틱 카드가 아니라 훼손되는 건 아닐까 걱정이 됐다.  \n  \n길거리에 다니는 버스도 지하철처럼 중간에 이어지는 부분이 있는 게 신기했다.  \n  \n구엘공원으로 가기 전에 카페에서 간단하게 아침을 먹었다. (€9.75로 16,542원이었다.)\n근데 먹고 나서 나중에 알고보니 이게 위에 엄청난 자극을 주는 조합이었다.\n이베리코 염장햄 샌드위치(나트륨) + 오렌지 주스(산성) + 커피(카페인)이 공복에 확 들어가니 위에 무리를 줬던 것 같다.\n  \n구엘 공원으로 가는 계단인데 건물 외부에 저렇게 에스컬레이터가 있는 것도 신기했다.  \n        \n구엘공원은 건축가인 가우디가 후원자인 구엘의 의뢰를 받아 고급 전원 주택 단지를 조성할 계획으로 만들어진 공간이라고 알고 있다.\n그래서인지 볼만한 거리들이 많았고 가이드를 통해 설명을 받는 관광객이 많았고 심지어 한국인 무리들도 꽤나 보였다.\n구엘공원의 입장료는 €28(47,503원)이었다.\n  \n구엘 공원 내부에 놀이터도 있었는데 이건 여기에 왜 있는 거지?? 하는 생각이 들었다.\n가족끼리 왔다가 아이가 지쳐하면 여기서 놀아주는 건가?? 싶었다.\n\n구엘 공원 안에서도 신기한 악기를 가지고 버스킹을 하는 아줌마가 있었다. 뭔가 음악 CD를 팔고 있었는데 본인이 연주한 음원인 것 같았다.\n그리고 다른 버스킹하는 사람들은 듣는사람이 있던 없던 상관없이 본인의 예술혼을 불태우며 연주를 하는데 이 아줌마는 관광객 무리가 지나가지 않으면 바로 연주를 중단하는 모습을 보고 자본주의의 노예구나 싶었다.\n구엘공원 관광을 마치고 공원 내부에 있는 공짜 화장실에 가서 볼일을 보고 나니 갑자기 토가 하고 싶어졌다.\n뭔가 몸상태가 이상해졌다는 것을 느껴서 뒤에 있던 일정들은 생각하지 않고 숙소로 가서 토를 하고 쉬었다.\n토를 하니 좀 나아지는 것 같아서 좀만 쉬면 괜찮아지겠지~ 하고 있었는데 30분 정도 지나자 또 토를 하고 싶어져서 토를 했다.  \n      \n그리고 챗GPT에게 내 상황을 설명하고, 뭐 때문에 그런 건지 지금 내 몸이 어떤 상황인 건지, 앞으로 어떻게 해야하는지 등등 자세히 물어보았다.\n근데 계속 쉬어도 나을 기미가 보이지 않자 병원을 가야하나 고민이 들어서 또 챗GPT한테 엄청 상담을 했더니 현재 내 상황이라면 응급실을 가는 게 좋을 거 같다고 얘기했다.\n말도 잘 안 통하고, 외국인 신분이고 돈이 엄청 깨질텐데… 하는 걱정에 가고 싶지 않았지만 이건 도저히 가만히 있어서는 해결이 될 문제가 아닐 거 같았다.\n그래서 어떤 응급실을 가야하는지 물어봤는데 우버는 택시 잡는데 기다리고 또 내 숙소 앞까지 택시가 못 올수도 있고, 차타면 오히려 멀미가 더 심해질 거 같았다.\n그래서 걸어가기로 마음을 먹었는데 한 2~30분 정도 걸리는 거리였는데 속이 안 좋다보니 더 천천히 갔다. 고개를 좌우로 돌리기만 해도 머리가 핑 도는 거 같아서 최대한 고개를 고정한 채로 천천히 걸어갔다.  \n그래서 Hospital Clínic de Barcelona로 갔는데 옆건물을 잘못 찾아갔는데 거기는 응급실이 아니라 뭔가 박물관? 전시관? 이었던 거 같기도 하다.\n그 건물 앞에서 관광객 무리가 있고 현지 가이드에게 뭔가 설명을 듣는 것 같아 보였다.\n그래서 어디로 가야하는지 다시 설명을 듣고 응급실로 갔다.  \n    \n응급실에는 3시 쯤에 도착해서 접수를 하다가 한 20분 정도 대기하다가 의사를 만나서 간단히 증상을 설명했다.\n그리고 나서 무한 대기의 시작이었다. 여기서부터 또 한 3시간을 대기한 것 같다.\n그리고 나서 내 순서가 되어 엘리베이터를 타고 4층으로 갔는데 장소를 이동해서인지 또 구토감이 올라와서 화장실로 가서 토를 하였다.\n그리고 여기서도 한 30분 ~ 1시간 정도 대기를 한 거 같고 그 다음에는 뭔가 빨간 젤리 같은 걸 먹어보라고 했다.  \n  \n내 위가 이것들을 먹을 준비가 됐는지 확인하는 거 같은데 먹고 나서 한 20분 지나니까 또 바로 토를 했다.\n그리고 또 한 30분 정도를 기다리니 그제서야 수액을 놔줬다.\n수액을 다 맞고나니 물을 줘서 물을 마셨는데 또 20분 정도 지나니까 토를 했다.\n그러니까 이번에는 수액을 한번 더 놔줬다.\n이 때 수액을 맞느라 옷을 벗었더니 체온이 35.9도까지 떨어져서 몸이 달달달 떨려서 가지고 온 잠바를 덮었다.\n그리고 수액을 다 맞고 나니 나보고 “Home! Go home!” 이러는 것이었다.\n나는 아직 어지럽다고 했는데도 그냥 집으로 가라고 했다. 말 안 통하는 해외에서 아프기까지 하니 정말 서러웠다.\n그리고 응급실 비용은 €295(500,679원)이 나왔다. (다행히 여행자 보험에서 100% 돌려받았다.)\n1층으로 내려가니 또 구토감이 몰려와서 한번 개워냈다.\n그리고 응급실을 나오니 10시가 넘은 시간이었다. 유럽의 병원이 얼마나 느리고 답답한지, 한국의 병원이 얼마나 쾌적한 건지 깨닫게 되었다.\n한시간만 기다려도 너무 답답하다고 생각했는데 그건 아주 선녀였다.\n아직 어지럼증이 남아있기 때문에 고개를 고정한 채로 천천히 숙소로 이동했다.\n근데 숙소에 들어서자마자 또 구토감이 밀려와서 한번 더 토를 했다.  \n이렇게 오늘 하루는 반나절은 관광을, 반나절은 응급실 신세를 졌다.\n아마 내 생각에는 아래와 같은 원인 때문에 이 지경에 이르른 것 같다.  \n\n튀르키예에서부터 공복(페티예에서 저녁 굶었고, 그 다음날 바르셀로나로 이동하면서 경유하느라 점심을 굶었고)을 반복\n스페인에 오자마자 폭식(바르셀로나 도착한 날 저녁에 한식으로 순두부찌개+제육볶음)을 했고  \n2주가 넘는 여행 기간동안 피로와 스트레스가 누적되고\n바르셀로나로 오니까 갑자기 추위가 시작되어 이 또한 몸에 영향을 준 거 같음.\n그리고 아침으로 공복에 위에 자극을 아주 강하게 줌 (나트륨 덩어링인 이베리코 염장햄 + 산성을 띄는 오렌지 쥬스 + 카페인 덩어리 커피)\n\n그리고 오늘 원래 가려고 예약했던 코스들을 하나도 가지 못해 피해가 막심했다.  \n\n카사 바트요 입장료 €29 (49,200원)  \n카사 밀라 입장료 €29 (49,200원)\n\n3일차 (숙소에서 휴식)\n아침까지도 공복으로 계속 있었다.\n그리고 계속 쉬다보니 속은 많이 편해졌지만 아직 어지럼증은 좀 있었다. 그래도 물 정도는 마실 수 있을 것 같아 물을 조금씩 한모금 마셔보았다.\n그런데 물을 마시니까 토하고 싶다는 생각이 또 들었는데 여기서 또 토를 하면 몸에 자극을 줄 수도 있다고 하여 몸을 세우고 억지로 참았다.\n좀 쉬니 안정이 되었고, 물 한 모금도 천천히 나눠마셔야하는데 너무 답답해서 한 번에 먹은 게 문제였던 것 같았다.\n그래서 물도 아주 천천히 나눠서 마셨다.\n고개를 돌리기만 해도 어지러우니 핸드폰도 제대로 하지 못하고 근데 심심은 또 하고 그래서 라디오 같은 게 필요했다.  \n\n  \n전에 문득 봤었던 침착맨의 대항해시대 2가 떠올랐다.\nBGM이 잔잔해서 듣다보면 잠이 올 거 같아서 플레이리스트를 재생하고 그냥 아무생각 없이 듣고만 있다보니 잠이 들었다.\n그리고 일어나서 또 대항해시대를 듣다가 자다가를 반복하다가 저녁이 되었다.\n계속 물만 먹다보니 뭔가 회복이 더딘 것 같아 바나나 같이 뭔가 에너지를 좀 더 공급할 수 있는 것을 먹어야 좀 더 빠르게 회복이 되지 않을까 싶었다.  \n\n그래서 챗GPT한테 물어서 어디가 문을 열었는지, 어디서 뭘 사면 좋을지 물어봐서 바나나, 배, 사과를 사왔다.\n일요일이라 주변에 있는 까르푸가 열지 않아 왕복 30분 거리에 있는 까르푸 익스프레스에 다녀왔다.\n30분을 걸어갔다오느라 정말 힘들었고, 일행이 왔더라면 부탁을 하면 될텐데… 하고 혼자 온 게 더 서러워지는 순간이었다.\n머리도 못 감고 거의 폐인 몰골로 다녀왔는데 어제보다는 그래도 확실히 어지럼증이 좀 줄어들긴 했지만 여전히 고개를 돌리면 어지러워서 차가 오나 안 오나 보는 것 자체가 고역이었다.\n가는 길에 팔레스타인 시위도 하고 멋진 장식도 있어서 사진을 찍고 싶기는 했지만 너무 어지럽고 도무지 그걸 찍을 여력이 되지 않아 사진은 하나도 못 찍었다.\n24시간 넘게 아무것도 먹지도 못하고 속도 편해져서 바나나 1개를 순식간에 먹어 치우고 배도 조금 먹었는데 조금 지나자 더부룩해졌다.\n좀 나아진 거 같다고 너무 성급하게 먹은 것 같았다.  \n그리고 이 상태로 더이상 여행을 강행할 수는 없어서 하루 빨리 한국으로 돌아가 제대로 치료도 받고 회복하고 싶어졌다.\n지금 상태라면 내일은 비행기를 탈 수 있을 거 같았다. 날이 바뀌어서 항공권 예약을 못 할 수도 있기 때문에 얼른 예약을 했다.\n그리고 내일은 숙소에서 체크아웃을 해야하기 때문에 더더욱 좋은 타이밍이었다.\n누군가와 함께 왔다면 일행에게 양해를 구하거나 굉장히 미안한 상황이었는데 그나마 이럴 때는 혼자서 결정을 하면 되기 때문에 다행이었다.  \n원래 오늘은 사그라다 파밀리아를 관광하기로 했는데 그것도 못가서 57,300원을 손해 보았다.  \n4일차 (한국으로 복귀)\n아침이 되니 어제 사온 과일들을 다 먹었다. (사과는 너무 푸석푸석해서 먹다가 말았다.)\n그래서 숙소 근처 까르푸에서 저녁까지 먹을 걸 사와야했다.  \n  \n그래서 챗GPT한테 뭘 사먹으면 좋을지 물어보았다.\n지금 내 어지럼증을 보완하려면 전해질 보충을 위해서 이온음료까지 추천해준 게 참 신기했다.  \n    \n다행히 오늘은 월요일이라 숙소 근처에 있는 까르푸가 열어서 여기서 바나나/플레인 요거트/이온음료/마르게리타 쿠키를 샀다.\n그리고 숙소에서 점심으로 바나나와 플레인 요거트, 이온음료를 먹었다.  \n12시가 돼서 체크아웃을 한 이후에는 바로 공항으로 이동하였다.\n그냥 한시라도 빨리 한국으로 귀국하고 싶어서 어디 관광하고 싶다는 생각도 들지 않았고 그러다보니 그냥 공항에서 기다리는 게 마음이 편할 것 같았다.\n그래서 2시간 단위로 바나나와 요거트를 먹으며 견뎠다. 그리고 좀 나아진 것 같아서 핸드폰으로 유튜브나 넷플릭스를 계속 봤는데 한 5시간 정도 보니까 너무 어지러워서 그냥 눈을 감고 대기했다.  \n  \n오후 8시 반에 출발해서 12시간 20분의 기나긴 여정이었다.\n항공권은 93만원이 들었다.\n근데 청천벽력같은 소식이 들렸다. 지연이 됐다는 소식이다. 공항에서만 대략 7시간 정도를 기다렸는데 더 기다려야한다는 소식에 절망이었다.\n그렇게 1시간이 지연돼서 9시 반에 출발을 했다.\n그리고 아직 속이 완전히 나은 게 아니기 때문에 기내식은 하나도 먹지 않고 물만 마셨다.\n근데 잠은 오지 않고 자세는 뭔가 불편한 거 같고, 자도 10분 자고 깨고 반복하다보니 너무 스트레스였다.\n언제 도착하는 걸까… 계속 핸드폰 시간만 보았고 정말 고통의 시간이었다. 그래도 시간은 흘러 결국 인천공항에 도착하였다.\n원래는 집에 혼자 가려고 했는데 몸이 이래서 부모님께 부탁을 해서 부모님 차를 타고 집에 가서 흰죽을 먹으니 살 것만 같았다.  \n그리고 몸을 좀 추스르고 보니 앞으로 남은 예약 내역들이 취소 안 되는 것들이 태반이어서 엄청난 손해를 봤다는 사실을 깨달았다. (요금을 좀 싸게하는 대신 취소가 안 되는 옵션으로 예약함.)\n좀 여유롭게 생각을 해야하는데 너무 타이트하게 일정을 잡았던 게 화근이었고, 몸이 아프니까 돈이 아깝다는 생각이 들지 않았는데 지금 와서 보니 정말 아까웠다 ㅠㅠ…\n\n바르셀로나 -> 세비야 항공권 32만원 (당일에 취소하려고 하니 2,900원만 환불되었다.)  \n세비야 숙소 3박 4일 37만원 (이건 하나도 환불을 받지 못했다.)  \n알카사르 궁전 입장료 €15.5 (26,351원)  \n세비야 대성당 + 히랄다 탑 입장료 €19 (32,298원)  \n세비야 <-> 론다 당일치기 왕복권 기차표 €83.35 (141,534원)  \n세비야 -> 포르투갈 리스본 항공권 29만원 (이것도 하나도 환불받지 못했다.)  \n포르투 -> 인천공항 항공권 26만원 (113만원인데 그나마 환불 받아서 이정도였다.)\n\n스페인 여행을 마치며\n  \n한국으로 북귀하고 3~4일 정도 쉬니까 몸이 많이 나아서 삼겹살과 된장찌개 같은 일반식은 가능하게 되었다.\n이비인후과를 가니 왼쪽으로 고개를 돌리면 눈이 한박자 늦게 따라온다고 하여 재활운동을 알려줘서 그것도 열심히 따라하니 어지러운 것도 말끔히 나았다.  \n한번 외국에 가서 아파보니 역시 건강이 최고란 사실을 깨닫기도 하고, 그렇게 나가서 고생할 바에 또 가야하나?? 란 생각도 들었다.\n유럽을 가긴 갔는데 하루만 제대로 관광하고 나머지는 다 아팠다보니 뭔가 아쉽기도 했는데 이게 트라우마가 되어 나중에 또 갈 수 있을까? 란 생각이 들었고, 누군가와 함께 가는 게 아니면 나 혼자의 의지로는 굳이 유럽을 가지는 않을 것 같다.\n이미 체험할 것이나 볼 거는 대충 본 거 같고 또 나는 건축이나 그런 것보다는 자연 & 동물파라서 그런 걸 볼 수 있는 곳으로 더더욱 가지 않을까 싶었다.\n당분간 해외를 나갈 일은 없겠지만 그래도 이렇게 길게 쉰 김에 좋은 경험을 했던 것 같다.\n그리고 다른 곳에서도 챗GPT의 도움을 많이 받았지만 스페인에서는 응급실부터 그 이후 휴식/식사까지 정말 많은 도움을 받았다.\nAI가 세상을 이롭게 하는 순간이라고 느꼈고 나도 누군가에게 도움이 되는 것을 만들고 싶다는 생각을 하였다.",

        "contentSnippet": "튀르키예는 동물 친화적인 곳이어서 자연을 사랑하는 내 입장에서는 매우 만족스러웠다.  \n시리즈\n\n해외여행 1편 - 케냐\n해외여행 3편 - 스페인\n\n튀르키예로 떠나기\n원래는 튀르키예(터키)를 갈 생각은 크게 없었다. 근데 탄자니아로 가려고 계획하던 당시 튀르키예에서 경유하는 항공권이 있길래 ‘겸사겸사 튀르키예를 먼저 여행하고, 다음에 탄자니아로 가면 경유 없이 직항으로만 갈 수 있지 않을까??’하는 생각에 튀르키예도 여행 계획을 세우게 되었다.\n하지만 큰 일을 뭔가 빨리 해치우고 싶어서 먼저 사파리를 해치우고 그 다음에 느긋하게 내 일정대로 여행할 수 있는 튀르키예로 가기로 마음 먹었다.\n튀르키예에서 뭔일이 나면 케냐에 일정대로 못 들어갈 수도 있어서 사파리를 못 즐길 수도 있다는 걱정이 들어 먼저 케냐에 가서 사파리를 해치우고 튀르키예로 향하게 되었다.\n  \n근데 케냐에서 튀르키예까지 직항이 하루에 한 번, 새벽에 밖에 없는 것이었다.\n케냐에서 새벽에 나와서 택시타고 돌아다니는 건 너무 위험하다고 생각이 됐다.  \n\n어쩔 수 없이 에티오피아의 아디스 아바바 공항을 경유하는 항공권으로 끊었다.\n케냐까지 오는 만큼 길지는 않았지만, 아디스 아바바 공항까지 2시간, 그리고 아디스 아바바 공항에서 5시간 10분 가량 대기, 이스탄불 공항까지 5시간 55분 가량 소요되는 총 13시간 5분의 긴 여정이었다.\n항공권은 172만원이 들었다.\n  \n아디스 아바바 공항까지는 2시간 밖에 걸리지 않았지만 기내식이 나왔다. 에티오피아의 대표 항공사다보니 이런 서비스 측면에서는 좋았던 것 같다.\n그리고 아프리카(?)답게 기내식에도 콩이 나왔다.  \n    \n그리고 아디스 아바바 공항에서 이제 5시간 10분을 대기해야하다보니 커피를 사서 노트북으로 여행 계획이나 짜려고 했다.\n그래서 커피를 주문하고 자리에 앉으려고 하니 테이블은 식사고객 전용이라고 내쫓는 것이었다.\n새삼 한국 스타벅스에서 노트북만 들고 죽치고 있는 게 얼마나 감사한 일인지 깨달았고, 공항 내를 방황하다가 겨우 자리를 발견해서 노트북으로 스페인 여행 계획을 짰다.\n근데 공항의 무료 와이파이를 이용하다보니 인터넷이 너무 자주 끊겼지만, 챗GPT는 그래도 쓸만한 수준이었다. (이번 여행은 챗GPT가 없었더라면 불가능했을 것이다.)  \n  \n오랜 대기 끝에 이스탄불 행 비행기를 탔고 여기서도 기내식이 나왔다.  \n\n  \n이스탄불로 가는 야간 비행 중 찍은 건데 야경이 참 예뻤다. 비행기를 타면서 보는 풍경은 어디든 예쁜 것 같다.\n그리고 시꺼먼 바다만 보다가 불빛을 보면 ‘아~ 곧 도착하겠구나!’ 하는 희망도 생겨서 더 좋았다.  \n1일차 (이스탄불 구시가지 + 신시가지)\n  \n긴 여정 끝에 이스탄불 공항에 도착할 수 있었다.\n튀르키예(+03:00)와 한국(+09:00)의 시차는 6시간이었기 때문에 한국 시간으로는 12:35 쯤으로 점심 먹을 시간이었다.\n그리고 케냐와 튀르키예는 시차가 없기 때문에 별도로 시차 때문에 고생할 일은 없었다.\n  \n이스탄불은 크게 3가지 구역으로 나뉘어져있는데 나는 세 구역을 다 둘러볼 생각이었기 때문에 그 중간 지점인 구시가지에 숙소(Sirkeci Mansion Hotel)를 잡았다. (2박 3일 기준 조식포함 263,316원)  \n    \n먼저 공항에서 Havaist라는 공항 버스를 타고 이동(버스 내에서 카드로 결제)해서 숙소 근처 정류장에 내렸는데 페리(배로 이동하는 대중교통) 선착장 근처에 내리게 되었다.\n탁 트인 바다와 배를 보니 뭔가 시원시원 했다.  \n    \n그리고 한국에서는 고층빌딩만 보다가 뭔가 유럽풍의 건물들을 보다보니 새삼 ‘내가 튀르키예에 온 게 맞구나~’하는 생각이 들었다.  \n\n  \n그리고 이스탄불에는 또 신기한 교통수단인 ‘트램’이라는 게 존재한다. 지상에 사람들도 다니는 도로에 저렇게 전철이 움직인다는 게 신기했다. 사람들이 무단횡단도 많이하고, 부정탑승도 많이 할 거 같은데 괜찮으려나…? 하는 생각이 들었다.  \n  \n그리고 이스탄불은 길냥이들의 천국이라고 들었는데 가자마자 나한테 앵기는 길냥이를 볼 수 있었다. 아마 사람들이 먹을 걸 주다보니 사람을 겁내지 않는 것 같았다.\n동물을 싫어하는 사람이라면 이스탄불에 와서는 못 살 거 같았다.  \n      \n아직 체크인 시작이 되지 않아 숙소에 짐만 맡기고 가려고 했는데 아침도 먹어도 된다고 해서 맛있게 먹었다.\n지중해 근처에 있는 나라라 그런지 올리브와 치즈가 종류별로 있어서 이들만의 건강 비결도 무엇인지 살짝 알 것 같았다.  \n    \n그리고 바로 톱카프 궁전을 구경하러 갔는데 아주 돈독이 올라서 풀패키지로만 판매를 하는 것이었다.\n나는 톱카프 궁전이랑 정원만 좀 구경하고 싶었는데 ‘하렘구역 + 톱카프 궁전 + 아야 이리니 교회’까지 포함된 패키지만 팔았고 가격은 $57 정도 하였다.  \n        \n주로 가이드를 끼고 오는 사람들이 대부분이었고, 나는 그냥 있는 느낌 그대로 느끼러 오디오 가이드만 들으면서 이동했는데 비슷한 전시품에 질리기만 하였다.  \n\n그리고 어디서 기도 소리 같은 게 들려오길래 녹음된 걸 트는 줄 알았는데 실제 사람이 앉아서 소리를 내고 있어서 신기했다.  \n  \n나는 8만원 넘게 내고 들어왔는데 고양이는 공짜로 들어왔을 생각을 하니 ‘여기는 고양이 팔자가 상팔자구나’하는 생각이 들었다.  \n      \n하렘 구역을 지나 정원 구역으로 들어서니 힐링이 되는 느낌이었다. 뭔가 탁 트인 광경에 새들도 보이고 ‘역시 나는 자연파구나’싶었다.\n    \n그리고 시계 박물관 같은 것도 있어서 대충 둘러보고 나왔다.\n오후에 신시가지 구경을 가려고 계획했는데 톱카프 궁전에서 너무 많은 시간을 써버렸다. 돈이 아까우니 조금이라도 더 보자는 생각으로 둘러봤는데 솔직히 하렘구역은 별 감흥이 없어서 돈과 시간 모두 아까웠다.  \n  \n톱카프 궁전을 나와 아야 소피아로 향했는데 내부를 구경하려면 티켓을 사야하는 것 같았다.\n티켓 사는 줄도 있고, 시간도 없고, 내부는 뭐 비슷비슷 할 거 같아서 그냥 바깥만 구경했다.  \n  \n그리고 바로 맞은편에는 블루 모스크(술탄 아흐메트 모스크)가 있는데 기도 시간이라 내부에 출입이 불가능해서 여기도 그냥 바깥만 구경했다.  \n  \n그리고 점심은 챗GPT가 추천해준 Sultanahmet Köftecisi라는 식당에서 소고기 쾨프테를 먹었다.\n소고기 완자라고 하길래 소고기이기도 하고 양고기도 아니니까 고기 잡내 같은 건 없겠지? 싶었는데 기름향인지 뭔지 너무 느끼한 냄새랑 맛이 확 올라왔다.\n결국 2/3만 먹고 나올 수 밖에 없었다. 혼자서 먹는데 $16.9(24,632원)이 들었다.\n그리고 식전에 저런 빵을 거의 대부분 주는데 저런 빵을 에크맥이라고 불렀다.  \n  \n점심을 먹고 신시가지로 이동하기 위해 트램을 탔는데 생각보다 사람이 많아서 뭔가 소매치기를 당하지는 않을까 무서워서 정신을 바짝차렸다.  \n    \n신시가지로 이동하니 여기서도 팔자좋게 꾸벅꾸벅 졸고있는 길냥이를 볼 수 있었다. 이스탄불은 그냥 길냥이 천국이다.  \n  \n그리고 여기는 관광객 뿐만 아니라 현지인들의 모습도 조금 볼 수 있었는데 놀이터에서 노는 가족들이 보였다.\n    \n그리고 신시가지 거리를 걸었는데 역시나 사람들이 굉장히 많았고 유럽풍 건물을 굉장히 많이 볼 수 있어서 좋았다.\n그리고 저렇게 큰 창문을 닦는 모습을 보니 옛날 영화의 시녀? 같은 그런 느낌의 사람처럼 보여서 뭔가 신기했다.  \n          \n성 안토니오 성당을 왔는데 천주교도가 아니지만 그래도 성당이 주는 분위기와 웅장함에 관광할만 한 것 같았다.  \n    \n그리고 고양이 뿐만 아니라 강아지들도 굉장히 평화롭게 살고 있었지만 살이 너무 뒤룩뒤룩 찐 강아지는 좀 걱정이 될 정도였다.\n    \n그리고 여기에 카이막 맛집이 있다고 해서 Karaköy Özsüt라는 카이막 집에 방문했는데 여기는 짠내투어에서도 방문한 곳이라고 한다.\n들어가니까 거의 한국인 정모하듯이 한국인 손님들로 가득하였고, 호불호 없이 달달하고 맛있을만한 아주 대중적인 디저트라는 느낌이 들었다.\n백종원 카이막은 Börekçi’nin Yeri라는 가게인데 내가 있는 곳과는 거리가 멀어서 그냥 신시가지에 있는 카이막 가게만 가서 먹어보았다.\n    \n그리고 갈라타 타워 구경을 갔는데 여기는 석양을 보는 게 참 이쁘다고 했는데 4시 경인데도 불구하고 일요일 주말이라 그런지 사람이 너무 많아서 밖에서만 구경을 했다.  \n      \n갈라타 타워를 구경하지 못하는 게 아쉬워서 돌마바흐체 궁전 & 시계탑까지 30분 가량을 걸어갔다.\n근데 궁전은 또 돈내고 구경해야하는데 비슷비슷한 풍경일 거 같아서 그냥 주변에 있는 모스크나 들어가서 구경했다.  \n\n  \n그리고 오늘의 하이라이트 장소를 만났다. 돌마바흐체 궁전 쪽으로 가는 내내 무슨 공원이 있어서 한번 가보았는데 바다와 공원의 조화가 너무나 아름다웠고 평화로웠다.\n8만원짜리 톱카프 궁전은 저리가라 할 정도로 나에게 너무나 큰 만족감을 선사한 곳이었고, 이 곳에 살고 싶다는 생각이 처음으로 들게 만든 장소였다.  \n\n  \n그리고 자유롭게 날아다니는 새들을 보며 ‘나도 한마리 새가 되어 여기저기 자유롭게 날아다니고 싶다’는 생각을 하였다.  \n\n  \n물론 새가 너무 많다보니 하늘을 뒤덮을 정도이고 새똥을 맞지는 않을까 걱정이 되기도 했다.\n\n  \n그리고 신시가지에서 구시가지로 넘어가는 다리를 걸어가는데 주변에 바다가 있다보니 낚시꾼들이 참 많았고 하나의 관광상품처럼 보이기도 했다. (아마 낚시대도 빌려주지 않을까 싶다.)  \n  \n그리고 신기한 게 저렇게 거대한 모스크가 여기 저기 널려있다는 것이다.\n국민 대부분이 이슬람교(90% 이상으로 알고 있다.)를 믿다보니 모스크에 진심인 것 같았다.  \n  \n저녁을 먹으러 Osman Kasap이라는 식당에 왔다. 챗GPT가 추천해준 식당은 ‘Kasap Osman’이었는데 근처에 가니 호객행위도 하고 이름도 비슷해서 내가 가려는 곳인 줄 알았다. (Kasap Osman은 일요일에 영업을 안 해서 어차피 갈 수도 없었지만…)  \n  \n챗GPT가 추천해준 아이란을 먹어봤는데 요거트 맛이 좀 나기도 하고 좀 심하면 위액맛 같이 느껴지기도 했지만 그정도까지 느껴지지는 않았다.  \n  \n또 챗GPT가 추천해준 렌틸수프로 속 달래기 용으로 먹어봤는데 레몬을 넣기 전에는 괜찮았지만 레몬을 너무 많이 넣어서 시큼해서 많이 못 먹어서 아쉬웠다.  \n  \n그리고 거의 모든 식당에서는 이렇게 식전에 에크맥 빵을 주었다.  \n  \n또 챗GPT가 추천해준 요거트 케밥을 먹었는데 점심에 먹은 소고기 쾨프테마냥 너무 느끼했다. 요거트 때문에 더 니글니글 대는 거 같았고 내 스타일이 전혀 아니었다.\n소고기인지 양고기인지 고기 잡내도 조금 나는 거 같았고 이건 절반 가까이 남긴 것 같다.\n$16.75로 24,350원을 냈는데 이렇게 비싼 돈을 들이고도 만족스럽지 못한 식사를 못해서 화가 났다.\n하지만 현지에서만 할 수 있는 경험을 해야된다고 생각해서 비축해둔 육개장 사발면은 아껴두었다.\n    \n관광을 모두 마치고 숙소로 왔는데 욕조도 있고 피로를 풀기 좋아 매우 만족스러웠다.  \n2일차 (이스탄불 아시아지구(카디쿄이 + 위스키다르))\n    \n호텔에서 조식을 먹었는데 벌꿀이 진짜 자연 그대로 모습으로 돼있는 게 신기했고, 흰색 달걀도 되게 신기했다.\n\n  \n그리고 숙소 근처에 있는 에미네뉘 선착장(Eminönü iskele)에서 카디쿄이 선착장(Kadıköy iskele)으로 이동했다.  \n  \n이동하는 중에 공사중인 모스크를 봤는데 마치 한국에 교회처럼 모스크가 정말 많은 것 같았다.  \n  \n길냥이 천국답게 사람이 앉아있어야할 곳에 고양이가 앉아있는 모습도 볼 수 있다.  \n        \n그리고 진짜 시장다운 시장을 보아서 튀르키예의 전통시장은 이렇구나~ 하고 느낄 수 있었다.\n    \n점심은 챗GPT가 추천해준 Çiya Sofrası라는 식당에서 Tavuk Şiş라는 치킨 케밥을 먹었다.\n하나도 느끼하지 않았고 채소들도 다 내 스타일이었고(고수가 없어서 다행이다), 너무 맛있게 먹었다.\n닭고기가 그나마 제일 무난하고 나한테 맞는 거 같아서 앞으로 닭고기 요리만 먹어야겠다고 생각했다.\n점심은 $21.77(31,789원)이 들었지만 정말 아깝지 않고 맛있는 한끼를 먹은 것 같아 만족스러웠다.\n    \n모다 해변 공원을 산책하다보니 다양한 생활체육 시설이 보여서 여기도 정말 살기 좋은 것 같았다.  \n      \n이스탄불은 정말 동물의 왕국인 거 같았다. 나는 자연/동물파이다보니 어딜가나 보이는 동물을 환영했지만 동물을 싫어하는 사람은 다시 한 번 살기 힘들 거 같다는 생각이 들었다.\n그정도로 동물이 정말 많았다.\n    \n해변 공원이라 역시 경치는 끝내주었고 여기서도 한번 살아보고 싶었다.  \n  \n그리고 우리 동네에는 오랫동안 있던 공중전화를 최근에 철거했는데 이스탄불에 와서 공중전화를 보니 왠지 반가웠다.\n근데 튀르키예에서도 공중전화 사용율이 얼마나 되는지 궁금했다.\n  \n그리고 유럽에서는 화장실도 돈내고 가야한다고 들어서 항상 현금이 필수라고 들었는데 이제 세상이 변했는지 카드를 찍고 화장실을 갈 수 있는 세상이 되었다.  \n  \n카디쿄이 관광을 마치고 위스키다르로 가는 도중에 길가에 퍼질러 자는 강아지를 보았다.\n보통은 좀 모퉁이나 울타리에 붙어서 자는데 얘는 길 너무 한복판에 누워서 자길래 정말 팔자가 좋구나~ 싶었다.\n    \n그리고 이제 위스키다르로 가기위해 위스키다르 선착장으로 왔다.\n  \n페리를 타고 이동하는데 물살을 가르고 가는 풍경이 시원시원했다.\n    \n그리고 위스키다르 선착장에서 내리자마자 보이는 모스크를 구경왔는데 신발을 벗고 들어가다보니 밖에서 발을 닦는 사람들이 보여서 신기했다.\n\n  \n그리고 실내 뿐만 아니라 밖에서도 예배가 이루어지고 다른 곳에서 진행하는 예배 소리가 들리는 것도 신기했다.  \n    \n아마 Glow Juice라는 가게인 거 같은데 천연 착즙쥬스가 먹고 싶어서 간 곳인데 가성비도 좋고 맛도 너무 좋았다.\n사장님이 예전에 농구선수를 해서 한국에 왔었다고 하다보니 내적 친밀감도 생기는 거 같았다.\n  \n쥬스를 마시며 산책을 했는데 어느 공원이 보였고 어린이들이 뛰어노는 걸 보니 뭔가 뿌듯하고 사람사는 냄새가 나는 것 같았다.\n확실히 나는 관광지보다는 자연, 동물, 가족들이 모여있는 곳이 나하고 어울리는 것 같았다.\n    \n도심에는 고양이가, 해변에는 갈매기가 점령한 모습도 볼 수 있었다.\n  \n관광객들이 많다보니 노점들도 많았는데 익숙한 옥수수도 보이니 반가웠다. 근데 우리나라처럼 찌는 거보다는 더 노랗고 뭔가 탄 자국도 보여서 우리 방식이랑은 좀 달라보였다.  \n  \n그리고 모스크가 모두 거대한 게 아니고 그냥 일반 건물 안에 예배할 수 있는 곳도 존재했다.\n마치 우리나라 상가 건물 2층에 교회가 있는 그런 느낌이었다.\n  \n그리고 구시가지로 다시 복귀해서 저녁을 먹으러 Eminönü Balıkçısı로 왔다.\n이틀 연속 케밥을 먹다보니 이제 케밥은 질려서 다른 음식을 추천해달라고 하니 챗GPT가 생선은 비리지도 않고 느끼하지도 않다고 해서 에미네뉘 선착장 근처에 있는 식당을 추천해주었다.\n  \n챗GPT가 추천해준 생선수프를 먹었는데 너~~~~무너무 느끼하고 니글거렸다. 보기만해도 너무 기름졌고 레몬을 넣어도 간에 기별도 안 가는 느끼함이었다.  \n  \n그리고 밥도 없이 저런 반찬으로 생선을 먹으려니 얼마 들어가지도 않고, 기름투성이 수프랑 먹으려니 더더욱 별로였다…\n$20.23(29,535)라는 거금을 들이고 이런 식사를 하니 또 너무 화가났다.\n3일차 (이스탄불에서 파묵칼레로…)\n  \n이스탄불에서 마지막 조식을 했는데 흰 계란은 봐도봐도 신기하고 탁구공 같다는 생각이 들었다.\n      \n그리고 첫날 블루모스크를 보지 못한 게 아쉬워서 가서 내부도 간단히 구경을 했다.  \n  \n그리고 아야소피아도 내부에 일부 구역은 구경할 수 있지 않을까… 싶었는데 입장권이 없으면 내부를 전혀 볼 수 없는 구조라서 그냥 돌아왔다.  \n        \n그랜드 바자르라고 대형 시장이 있다고 해서 구경을 갔는데 굉장히 크고 블록 단위로 테마(옷, 그릇, 향신료 등등)이 있어서 구경하는 재미가 있었다. \n  \n그리고 그랜드 바자르를 나와서 다시 숙소로 돌아가는데 총포상 같은 게 보였다.\n우리나라는 총포상이라 할지라도 저렇게 밖에서 보이듯이 총을 전시하지는 않는데 여기는 총을 대놓고 판매하는 게 신기했다.\n    \n그리고 숙소에서 짐을 찾아 이스탄불 공항으로 가기 위해 Havaist 버스 정류장에 도착을 했다.\n근데 갑자기 거기에서 안내를 하는 아저씨가 나에게 오더니 몇시 비행기냐고 물어보았다. 왜 물어보는지 몰랐는데 다가오는 버스에 2자리 밖에 없고, 나보다 늦게온 2명이 비행기 시간이 촉박한 상황이었다.\n그래서 양보해달라는 눈치였고 나는 넉넉하게 나왔기 때문에 눈물을 머금고 양보해주었다. 원래는 공항에 가서 여유롭게 점심을 먹으려고 했는데 이제 공항에 가서 촉박할지 모르기 때문에 그냥 노점에 있는 군밤과 쥬스로 점심을 간단히 떼웠다.  \n  \n그리고 이스탄불 공항에 와서 아아를 마셨는데 무슨 8천원 가까이 하는 것이었다. 너무 비싸다는 생각이 들어서 어글리 코리안의 면모를 보여주었다.\n탑승까지 남은 시간동안 휴대폰/노트북을 충전하면서 콘센트를 두개나 차지했다.\n  \n파묵칼레로 가기 위해서는 데니즐리 공항을 가야했는데 국내선이라 그런지 1시간 10분 정도 밖에 걸리지 않았다.\n항공권은 5만원이 들었다.\n  \n근데 한시간 정도 밖에 가지 않는데도 기내식이 나와서 신기했다. 물론 간단한 샌드위치 형태로 나왔고, 물이 생수병이 아닌 요플레 같은 플라스틱 통에 담겨나오는 것도 신기했다.\n  \n파묵칼레로 가기 위해서는 데니즐리 공항에서 버스를 타고 데니즐리 오토가르(버스정류장)으로 갔다가 돌무쉬를 타고 파묵칼레로 가면 된다.\n아래 두 블로그 글이 큰 도움이 되었다.

(1박 2일 기준 조식포함 44,166원)\n저녁 늦게 도착하다보니 밖에 나가서 저녁을 먹기 애매해서 아껴뒀던 육개장 사발면을 먹어서 행복했다.  \n4일차 (파묵칼레 석회붕 + 히에라폴리스)\n    \n호텔에서 조식은 매우 고급스럽게 나왔고, 직접 가져다주셨다. 그리고 오므라이스를 원하면 얘기하라길래 한국식으로 볶음밥에 계란을 덮어주는 형태인 줄 알았는데 튀르키예에서는 그냥 계란후라이를 오므라이스라고 부르는 것 같았다.  \n  \n저녁에 못 본 풀장도 봤는데 너무 추워보여서 수영할 엄두는 나지 않았다. \n  \n그리고 열기구는 카파도키아 지역에서만 하는 줄 알았는데 파묵칼레에서도 열기구를 탈 수 있는 것 같았다.\n  \n숙소에서 조금만 가니 파묵칼레 석회붕이 나오기 시작했다.\n입장료를 내려고 하는데 클레오파트라 풀은 겨울이라 종료됐다고 해서 아쉬웠고, 무슨 무선 이어폰(+오디오 가이드)까지 포함한 풀패키지 밖에 없었던 것 같고 가격은 $45.95(68,297원)나 하였다.\n뭔가 상술에 당한 것 같아보였지만 톱카프 궁전에 비하면 선녀였고, 톱카프 궁전보다 만족도는 훨~~~~씬 높았다.\n  \n입장하자마자 귀여운 댕댕이가 있어서 반가웠다. 역시 튀르키예는 어딜가나 동물이 있는 것 같다.  \n  \n파묵칼레 석회붕 보호를 위해 맨발로 걸어 올라갔어야하는데 11월 아침이기도 했고, 해가 들지 않는 곳을 지나갈 때면 발이 너무 차가웠다.  \n\n  \n이렇게 물이라도 있는 곳은 너무 차가워서 진짜 숨참고 겨우겨우 지나갔다.\n    \n그래도 꼭대기로 올라오니 온천수가 나오는 것 같았고, 이쪽은 물이 따뜻해서 사람들이 제법 있었다.  \n    \n그래도 꼭대기로 오니 올라온 보람이 있을 정도로 경치가 정말 아름다웠다.\n  \n그리고 너무 발이 따갑다보니 네발로 걸어오고 그랬는데 그러다보니 손에 묻은 석회들로 인해 가방도 지저분해졌다.\n  \n꼭대기에는 귀여운 고양이가 물을 마시고 있었다.  \n이제 파묵칼레 석회붕을 모두 구경한 후에는 히에라폴리스 유적지 관광을 할 차례였다.\n사실 튀르키예에서는 히에라폴리스가 제일 기대됐다.  \n  \n마치 내가 중세시대 RPG 게임 속 주인공이 되어 맵을 돌아다니는 기분이 들 것만 같았다. (게임은 ‘킹덤 컴: 딜리버런스’이다.)  \n            \n예상은 적중했고, 그 시대 그대로 건축물들이나 흔적들이 남아있다보니 마치 내가 그 시대를 살아가는 듯한 느낌이 들어서 정말 재미있었다.  \n  \n원형극장은 정말 웅장했고, 가끔 여기서 음악 공연도 한다는데 라이브로 보면 정말 소름이 돋지 않을까 싶었다.\n조카들에게도 영상통화를 걸어서 보여주니 매우 신기해했고 나보고 여기저기 가보라고 시켜서 진짜 게임 케릭터가 된 듯한 느낌이었다.\n근데 히에라폴리스의 단점은 너무 커서 걸어서 돌아다니면서 보기에는 거리가 너무 멀다는 것이어서 시간이 촉박해서 엄청 여유롭게 보지는 못했다.\n그리고 거의 3만보 가까이 걸어서 다리가 아프기도 했다.  \n  \n그리고 유적지 안에 쓰레기와 속옷이 있는 것을 보았다. 이전에 케냐에서 같이 여행하던 일행 중에 이렇게 길가에 버려진 쓰레기를 보면 ‘What the fxxx’을 연발하던 에스토니아 사람이 있었는데 그 사람의 목소리가 들리는 것만 같았다.\n  \n관광을 모두 마치고 점심을 먹으러 왔는데 아래 블로그에서 추천해준 맛집이라서 와봤는데 너~~~무 내 취향이었다.  \n\n24 튀르키예 #33.

(2박 3일 기준 조식포함 238,262원)  \n또 저녁 늦은 시간이라 밖에서 저녁을 먹기는 애매하고, 육개장을 지금 또 먹기는 아깝고… 했는데 다행히 숙소에서 레스토랑을 운영한다고 했다.  \n    \n근데 올라와보니 식사보다는 술을 파는 분위기였고, 그나마 무난한 파스타를 하나 시켰다.\n맛은 뭐 그럭저럭이었는데 $21.01 (30,838원)으로 너무 비싸서 눈물이 났다.  \n5일차 (페티예 + 욜루데니즈)\n페티예는 패러글라이딩으로 유명하다고들 하는데 나는 단양에서 패러글라이딩을 한 번 해보기도 했고, 아저씨가 재밌는 거 보여준다고 하는데 바이킹처럼 위아래로 내려갔다 올라갔다를 반복해줬는데 나는 바이킹을 싫어해서 너무나 싫었다.\n그래서 이번에는 패러글라이딩을 타지 않기로 했다.  \n  \n어제 저녁을 먹었던 식당에서 아침을 먹었는데 퀄리티는 굉장히 좋았고, 자리에 앉으면 직접 가져다주었다.\n오이 때문에 방울토마토를 하나도 먹지 못한 게 아쉬웠다.\n  \n아침페 페티예 시장 산책을 나왔는데 열지 않은 가게들이 많이 보였다.  \n    \n그리고 보트투어 도시답게 캐리비안의 해적 컨셉으로 꾸민 배들이 보였다.\n나도 보트투어를 하고 싶었는데 내가 가는 시즌이 겨울 시즌이라고 운영을 하지 않아서 아쉬웠다.  \n  \n그리고 놀이터가 보여서 와봤는데 이렇게 길게 늘어져있는 게 처음에는 ‘단체로 타는 그네인가?’ 싶었는데 아마 저 줄을 밟고 건너는 것 같다.\n  \n그리고 튀르키예 아이스크림을 현지에서 느껴보고 싶어서 한번 시켜봤는데 이스탄불이 아니라 페티예라 그런지 그냥 담아서 줬다.\n맛도 뭐 그냥저냥 평범했다. 가격은 $4.75로 6,975원으로 좀 비싼 편이었다.  \n  \n\n  \n택시를 타고 페티예에서 욜루데니즈로 이동했다.\n해변은 아름다웠는데 탈의실이 어디있는지 몰라서 여기서는 구경만 했는데 겨울이고 오전이라 그런지 수영하는 사람이 거의 보이지 않았다.\n  \n그래서 돈내고 입장하는 블루라군에 왔다. (입장료는 $2.37로 3,500원 정도)\n\n  \n블루라군은 물고기 보는 재미도 있었다.\n혼자오고 좀 춥기도 하고 평상시 수영을 그렇게 즐기지도 않다보니 1시간 정도 있다보니 슬슬 지루해져서 나왔다.\n그리고 점심을 뭘 먹을까 고민하는데 한국말까지 써가며 적극적으로 호객행위하는 사장님이 있었다.\n튀르키예 식 피자인 피데인데 닭고기가 들어간 걸 먹고싶다고 하자 치킨 피자는 있다고 해서 뭐 비슷하겠거니 하고 갔다.  \n  \n맛을 봤는데 뭐 그냥 저냥… 한 2/3 정도만 먹을만한 맛이었다.\n보니까 메뉴판에도 치킨 피자라는 메뉴는 없는데 사장님이 장사하기 위해서 발로 뛰는 느낌으로 보였다.\n그리고 내가 한국인이라고 20%인가 15%인가를 할인해준다고 하였다.\n그리고 자신들이 할인을 해주기 때문에 은근 현금 유도를 하면서 카드 기계가 없다고 종업원이 그러길래 나도 카드 밖에 없다고 했다. (현금은 택시탈 때 써야해서 없다고 했다. 또 ATM 수수료를 물고 싶지 않았다.)\n그러니까 정말 현금이 없냐고 사장이 물어보더니 내가 진짜로 없다고 하자 마지못해 카드 기계에 전원을 키고 카드로 결제했다. ($11.87로 17,433원 정도에 먹었으니 적당한 가격에 먹은 것 같다.)\n  \n그리고 숙소로 돌아오는 길에 웨딩카를 보았다. 나는 혼자 이렇게 여행을 왔는데 누군가는 신혼여행을 오다니 참 부러웠다.\n  \n그리고 다음 행선지인 스페인 여행일정도 세우고 이제 튀르키예 음식이 질리기도 해서 저녁은 걸렀다.\n너무 배가 고파서 육개장의 유혹이 땡겼지만 한 국가마다 육개장은 하나씩만 먹는다는 규칙을 지키기 위해 참았다.\n페티예의 바다는 아침에 보면 너무 배가 많아서 징그러웠는데 밤에보니 보기 좋았다.  \n  \n이렇게 아침과 비교해보면 얼마나 꼴보기 싫은지 알 수 있게 된다.\n6일차 (스페인으로 떠나기)\n페티예는 더이상 크게 볼 것이 없기도 했고, 스페인에 낮에 도착해서 하루라도 더 관광하기 위해서 오전 10시 비행기를 잡았다.\n그러려면 오전 8시까지는 달라만 공항에 도착해야하고, 아침 일찍부터 움직여야하는데 대중교통으로 움직이면 불안해서 7시에 택시를 미리 예약해뒀는데 $61.5(90,254원)이나 들었다.\n지나고 보니 조식도 못먹고 택시비는 9만원씩이나 쓰고 너무 촉박하게 움직였던 것 같아 굳이 이렇게까지 했어야했나… 하는 생각이 들었다.  \n  \n챗GPT가 달라만 공항에 버거킹이 있을 거라고 해서 기대하면서 들어갔는데 버거킹은 없고 서브웨이만 있었다.\n근데 나는 샌드위치보다는 고기가 들어간 따뜻한 햄버거가 먹고 싶어서 햄버거도 파는 식당으로 갔다.  \n  \n혹시나 오이나 피클이 들어갈까봐 빼달라고 했는데 의미 전달이 잘못돼서 치킨 패티 빼고 다 빼주었다.\n그래서 채소나 과일이 하나도 없는 뻑뻑한 버거를 비싼돈($22.24로 32,727원) 주고 먹어야했다.\n감자튀김은 맛있었는데 메인인 햄버거가 너무 부실해서 어제 저녁 굶고 첫끼인데 내가 3만원이나 넘게 내고 이런 식사를 먹어야하나 화가 났다.  \n튀르키예 여행을 마치며\n튀르키예는 큰 기대를 하지 않았는데 자연과 동물 두가지를 다 챙긴 아주 실속있고 만족스러운 여행이었다.\n오히려 톱카프 궁전이나 블루 모스크처럼 각잡고 구경하는 곳보다 그냥 동네 공원이나 바다에서 새나 경치를 구경하는 게 훨~~~씬 좋았다.\n그리고 히에라폴리스도 진짜 내가 중세시대에 사는 듯한 느낌을 간접적으로 느끼게 해주어 좋았다.\n오히려 의도하고 계획을 세웠던 곳들보다 우연히 발견한 해변 공원들이 나를 더욱 행복하게 해준 걸 보면 항상 계획한 대로 되는 법은 없는 것 같다.",

기술적 논의만으로는 충분하지 않다. 모든 시스템은 목적을 가지고 만들어지며, 모든 행동은 의도한 결과뿐 아니라 의도하지 않은 결과도 낳는다. 엔지니어는 시스템이 사회에 미치는 영향을 고려하고, 어떤 세계를 만들고 싶은지에 대해 의식적으로 선택할 책임을 가진다.</p>\n<p>데이터는 추상적 대상처럼 보이지만, 실제로는 사람들의 행동·관심·정체성에 관한 데이터가 많다. 따라서 사람에 관한 데이터를 다룰 때는 인간 존엄과 존중을 최우선 가치로 두어야 한다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"기술은-선악이-아니라-사용-방식이-문제이다\">기술은 선악이 아니라 사용 방식이 문제이다</h3>\n<p>기술 자체가 선하거나 악한 것이 아니라, 그것이 어떻게 사용되고 사람에게 어떤 영향을 미치는지가 중요하다. 검색 엔진과 같은 소프트웨어도, 총과 같은 무기도 “사용과 결과”가 본질을 결정한다. 엔지니어가 기술만 바라보고 결과를 외면하는 태도는 충분하지 않으며, 윤리적 책임은 엔지니어에게도 존재한다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"예측-분석predictive-analytics은-개인의-삶을-직접적으로-바꾼다\">예측 분석(Predictive Analytics)은 개인의 삶을 직접적으로 바꾼다</h2>\n<p>날씨나 질병 확산을 예측하는 분석과 달리, 다음과 같은 예측은 개인의 삶에 직접 영향을 준다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>재범 가능성 판단</li>\n<li>대출 부도 가능성 판단</li>\n<li>보험금 청구 위험 판단</li>\n<li>채용에서의 “리스크” 판단</li>\n</ul>\n<p>조직은 위험 회피 관점에서 “의심스러우면 거절”을 선택하기 쉽다. 그러나 알고리즘이 개인을 “위험하다”고 라벨링하면, 그 사람은 반복적으로 거절당하며 사회 참여에서 배제될 수 있다. 이러한 체계적 배제는 개인의 자유를 크게 제한하며, “알고리즘 감옥(algorithmic prison)”이라고 불리기도 한다. 이는 죄가 증명되기 전까지 무죄를 전제로 하는 인권 원칙과 정면으로 충돌할 수 있다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"편향과-차별-알고리즘은-공정함을-자동으로-만들지-않는다\">편향과 차별: 알고리즘은 공정함을 자동으로 만들지 않는다</h2>\n<p>알고리즘 판단이 인간 판단보다 반드시 공정하거나 불공정한 것은 아니다. 인간도 편향을 가지고 있으며 차별이 제도화될 수 있다. 데이터 기반 판단이 오히려 더 공정할 수 있다는 기대도 존재한다.</p>\n<p>그러나 예측 분석에서 규칙 자체를 데이터로부터 학습시키면 다음 문제가 발생한다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>학습된 패턴이 불투명(opaque)하여 “왜 그렇게 판단했는지” 알기 어렵다.</li>\n<li>입력 데이터가 편향되어 있으면, 모델은 그 편향을 학습하여 <strong>증폭</strong>할 가능성이 높다.</li>\n<li>보호 특성(인종/성별/나이/장애/종교 등)을 직접 사용하지 않더라도, 우편번호·IP 주소 등은 보호 특성과 강하게 상관될 수 있어 사실상 대리 변수(proxy)가 된다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>따라서 편향된 과거 데이터로부터 “공정한 미래”가 자동으로 만들어진다고 믿는 태도는 위험하다. 예측 모델은 과거를 외삽할 뿐이며, 과거가 차별적이었다면 그 차별을 제도화한다. 더 나은 미래를 만들기 위해서는 인간의 도덕적 상상력과 의식적 개입이 필요하다. 데이터와 모델은 도구이지 주인이 아니다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"책임과-설명-가능성-누가-책임지는가\">책임과 설명 가능성: 누가 책임지는가</h2>\n<p>자동화된 의사결정이 확산되면 책임과 설명 가능성 문제가 발생한다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>인간이 실수하면 책임을 물을 수 있고 항소 절차가 가능하다.</li>\n<li>알고리즘이 실수하면 누가 책임지는지 불분명해진다.</li>\n<li>자율주행차 사고, 신용평가 알고리즘의 차별 등에서 책임 주체가 모호해진다.</li>\n<li>사법적 검토가 들어오면, 모델이 왜 그런 결정을 했는지 설명할 수 있어야 한다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>전통적 신용점수는 대체로 “개인의 과거 상환 기록” 같은 관련 사실에 기반하며, 오류 수정의 가능성이 존재한다(절차가 어렵더라도). 반면 머신러닝 기반 평가는 입력이 훨씬 넓고 불투명하여, 특정 개인이 왜 불이익을 받았는지 확인하기 어렵고 부당 대우 여부도 판단하기 어렵다.</p>\n<p>또한 예측 분석은 종종 “당신은 과거에 무엇을 했는가”가 아니라 “당신과 유사한 사람들이 과거에 무엇을 했는가”에 근거한다. 이는 고정관념과 범주화(stereotyping)를 내포하며, 잘못된 범주에 배치된 개인에게는 구제가 어렵다. 예측은 본질적으로 확률적이므로, 전체적으로는 맞더라도 개별 사례에서 틀릴 수 있다. 따라서 데이터 기반 결정의 절대적 우월성을 믿는 태도는 위험하다.</p>\n<p>필요한 과제는 다음과 같다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>알고리즘의 책임성과 투명성 확보</li>\n<li>편향 증폭 방지</li>\n<li>오류가 발생했을 때 수정 및 구제(recours) 메커니즘 구축</li>\n<li>데이터가 사람을 해치는 데 쓰이지 않도록 방지</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"피드백-루프-예측이-현실을-고정시키는-악순환\">피드백 루프: 예측이 현실을 고정시키는 악순환</h2>\n<p>추천 시스템처럼 비교적 “가벼운” 예측에서도 사회적 문제는 발생한다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>사용자가 이미 동의하는 콘텐츠만 노출되어 <strong>에코 챔버</strong>가 강화될 수 있다.</li>\n<li>고정관념, 허위정보, 양극화가 증폭될 수 있다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>개인의 삶에 직접 영향을 주는 예측에서는 더 위험한 <strong>자기강화 피드백 루프</strong>가 생긴다. 예를 들어 채용에서 신용점수를 활용하면, 불운으로 점수가 떨어진 사람은 취업이 어려워지고, 실업은 빈곤을 심화하며, 점수는 더 악화되는 하향 나선이 발생한다. 수학적 엄밀성과 데이터가 이러한 가정을 가리는 위장막이 될 수 있다.</p>\n<p>이 문제는 컴퓨터만이 아니라 사람과 제도를 포함한 전체 시스템을 보는 <strong>시스템 사고(systems thinking)</strong> 가 필요하다. 시스템이 기존 격차를 증폭하는지, 불의를 완화하는지, 의도치 않은 결과는 무엇인지 점검해야 한다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"프라이버시와-트래킹-데이터-수집-자체의-윤리-문제\">프라이버시와 트래킹: 데이터 수집 자체의 윤리 문제</h2>\n<p>사용자가 명시적으로 입력한 데이터를 저장·처리하는 시스템은 사용자를 위한 서비스를 수행하며, 사용자와 서비스의 관계가 비교적 명확하다. 반면 사용자의 활동이 “부수 효과”로 추적·기록되는 경우 관계는 달라진다. 서비스는 사용자가 시킨 일만 수행하는 것이 아니라, 자체 이해관계를 갖게 되며, 이는 사용자의 이해관계와 충돌할 수 있다.</p>\n<p>트래킹은 검색 품질 향상, 추천, A/B 테스트, UI 개선 등 사용자에게 이득을 주는 측면도 있다. 그러나 광고 기반 비즈니스 모델에서는 사용자가 아니라 광고주가 실질적 고객이 되며, 추적은 더 정교해지고 보유 기간이 길어지며, 개인 프로파일링이 강화된다. 이 관계는 “감시(surveillance)”로 볼 수 있다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"감시surveillance라는-관점의-사고-실험\">감시(surveillance)라는 관점의 사고 실험</h2>\n<p>“data”라는 단어를 “surveillance(감시)”로 치환하면, 평소 미화되던 표현이 다른 의미로 들린다. 대규모 감시 인프라가 사실상 구축되고 있으며, IoT의 확산은 마이크·센서가 상시 연결되는 환경을 만들고 있다. 많은 기기는 보안 수준도 낮다.</p>\n<p>과거의 권위주의 국가도 상상하기 어려웠던 “항상 휴대되는 위치 추적 장치”와 “공간마다 존재하는 마이크”가 기업 주도의 방식으로 현실화되고 있다. 감시는 정부만이 아니라 기업에 의해 수행될 수 있으며, 그 결과가 개인의 보험·고용 등 삶의 핵심 영역을 좌우하면 더 이상 “무해한 개인화”로 보기 어렵다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"동의consent와-선택의-자유는-형식적으로만-존재할-수-있다\">동의(consent)와 선택의 자유는 형식적으로만 존재할 수 있다</h2>\n<p>이용약관과 프라이버시 정책에 동의했으므로 사용자가 자발적으로 선택했다고 주장할 수 있다. 그러나 다음 한계가 존재한다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>사용자는 어떤 데이터가 수집되고 어떻게 결합·보존·처리되는지 충분히 알기 어렵다.</li>\n<li>프라이버시 정책은 이해를 돕기보다 은폐하는 방식으로 작성되는 경우가 많다.</li>\n<li>한 사람의 데이터는 다른 사람(서비스 비사용자)의 정보도 유추할 수 있어, 당사자의 동의만으로 충분하지 않다.</li>\n<li>데이터 제공과 서비스 제공의 교환은 상호 호혜적 협상 관계가 아니라, 서비스가 일방적으로 조건을 정한다.</li>\n<li>서비스가 사회 참여에 사실상 필수라면(네트워크 효과 포함), “사용하지 말라”는 선택지는 실질적 자유가 아니다.</li>\n<li>결국 감시에 동의하지 않는 사람에게 의미 있는 선택권이 없을 수 있으며, 감시는 특권층을 제외하면 회피하기 어려워진다.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"프라이버시는-비밀이-아니라-결정권이다\">프라이버시는 비밀이 아니라 “결정권”이다</h2>\n<p>“프라이버시는 죽었다”는 주장은 프라이버시 개념을 오해한 것이다. 프라이버시는 모든 것을 숨긴다는 뜻이 아니라, <strong>무엇을 누구에게 공개할지 스스로 결정할 자유</strong>를 의미한다. 감시 인프라를 통해 데이터가 추출되면, 이 결정권은 개인에서 데이터 수집자로 이전된다.</p>\n<p>기업은 “올바르게 사용하겠다”고 요구하며, 사용자에게는 선택권이 제한된다. 또한 기업은 감시의 결과를 공개하지 않는 경향이 있으며, 광고 타기팅 같은 간접 형태로만 드러난다. 이는 개인이 자신의 민감 정보(질병 여부 등)의 공개에 대한 주도권을 잃는 결과를 낳는다.</p>\n<p>프라이버시 설정은 일부 통제권을 되돌리는 시작점이지만, 서비스 제공자는 여전히 데이터에 광범위한 접근권과 내부 분석권을 가진다. 개인의 프라이버시 권리가 대규모로 기업에 이전되는 현상은 역사적으로 전례가 드물다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"데이터는-자산이자-위험-자산toxic-asset이다\">데이터는 자산이자 위험 자산(toxic asset)이다</h2>\n<p>행동 데이터는 “데이터 배출물(data exhaust)”처럼 가치 없는 부산물로 묘사되기도 한다. 그러나 광고 기반 모델에서는 행동 데이터가 사실상 핵심 자산이며, 사용자 서비스는 데이터 수집을 위한 수단으로 전락할 수 있다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>데이터 브로커 산업은 개인 데이터를 구매·결합·추론·재판매한다.</li>\n<li>정부도 비공식 협력, 강제력, 법적 요구, 또는 탈취를 통해 데이터를 획득하려 한다.</li>\n<li>기업 파산 시 개인 데이터는 매각될 수 있다.</li>\n<li>데이터 유출은 빈번하며, 데이터는 “유해 물질”에 비유되기도 한다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>따라서 데이터 수집은 “오늘의 정치 환경”뿐 아니라 “미래의 모든 정권”까지 고려해야 한다. 언젠가 인권을 존중하지 않는 정권이 등장할 가능성을 배제할 수 없으므로, 장차 경찰 국가를 가능케 할 기술을 설치하는 것은 시민적 위생(civic hygiene) 관점에서 위험하다.</p>\n<p>데이터와 지식은 권력이며, 타인을 감시하면서 자신은 감시받지 않는 것은 강력한 권력이다. 기술 기업이 정치 권력을 노리지 않더라도, 축적된 데이터는 공적 감독 밖에서 사람들의 삶에 영향을 미치는 잠재적 권력이 된다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"산업혁명과-정보화-시대-데이터는-정보-시대의-오염이다\">산업혁명과 정보화 시대: 데이터는 “정보 시대의 오염”이다</h2>\n<p>정보화

의도하지 않은 결과도 낳는다. 엔지니어는 시스템이 사회에 미치는 영향을 고려하고, 어떤 세계를 만들고 싶은지에 대해 의식적으로 선택할 책임을 가진다.\n데이터는 추상적 대상처럼 보이지만, 실제로는 사람들의 행동·관심·정체성에 관한 데이터가 많다. 따라서 사람에 관한 데이터를 다룰 때는 인간 존엄과 존중을 최우선 가치로 두어야 한다.\n기술은 선악이 아니라 사용 방식이 문제이다\n기술 자체가 선하거나 악한 것이 아니라, 그것이 어떻게 사용되고 사람에게 어떤 영향을 미치는지가 중요하다. 검색 엔진과 같은 소프트웨어도, 총과 같은 무기도 “사용과 결과”가 본질을 결정한다. 엔지니어가 기술만 바라보고 결과를 외면하는 태도는 충분하지 않으며, 윤리적 책임은 엔지니어에게도 존재한다.\n예측 분석(Predictive Analytics)은 개인의 삶을 직접적으로 바꾼다\n날씨나 질병 확산을 예측하는 분석과 달리, 다음과 같은 예측은 개인의 삶에 직접 영향을 준다.\n재범 가능성 판단\n대출 부도 가능성 판단\n보험금 청구 위험 판단\n채용에서의 “리스크” 판단\n조직은 위험 회피 관점에서 “의심스러우면 거절”을 선택하기 쉽다. 그러나 알고리즘이 개인을 “위험하다”고

가능하다.\n알고리즘이 실수하면 누가 책임지는지 불분명해진다.\n자율주행차 사고, 신용평가 알고리즘의 차별 등에서 책임 주체가 모호해진다.\n사법적 검토가 들어오면, 모델이 왜 그런 결정을 했는지 설명할 수 있어야 한다.\n전통적 신용점수는 대체로 “개인의 과거 상환 기록” 같은 관련 사실에 기반하며, 오류 수정의 가능성이 존재한다(절차가 어렵더라도).

동의하지 않는 사람에게 의미 있는 선택권이 없을 수 있으며, 감시는 특권층을 제외하면 회피하기 어려워진다.\n프라이버시는 비밀이 아니라 “결정권”이다\n“프라이버시는 죽었다”는 주장은 프라이버시 개념을 오해한 것이다. 프라이버시는 모든 것을 숨긴다는 뜻이 아니라, 무엇을 누구에게 공개할지 스스로 결정할 자유를 의미한다. 감시 인프라를 통해 데이터가

통제권을 되돌리는 시작점이지만, 서비스 제공자는 여전히 데이터에 광범위한 접근권과 내부 분석권을 가진다. 개인의 프라이버시 권리가 대규모로 기업에 이전되는 현상은 역사적으로 전례가 드물다.\n데이터는 자산이자 위험 자산(toxic asset)이다\n행동 데이터는 “데이터 배출물(data exhaust)”처럼 가치 없는 부산물로 묘사되기도 한다. 그러나 광고 기반 모델에서는 행동 데이터가 사실상 핵심 자산이며, 사용자 서비스는 데이터 수집을 위한 수단으로 전락할 수 있다.\n데이터 브로커 산업은 개인 데이터를 구매·결합·추론·재판매한다.\n정부도 비공식 협력, 강제력, 법적 요구, 또는 탈취를 통해 데이터를 획득하려 한다.\n기업 파산 시 개인 데이터는 매각될 수 있다.\n데이터 유출은 빈번하며, 데이터는 “유해 물질”에 비유되기도 한다.\n따라서 데이터 수집은 “오늘의 정치 환경”뿐 아니라 “미래의 모든 정권”까지 고려해야 한다. 언젠가 인권을 존중하지 않는 정권이 등장할 가능성을 배제할 수 없으므로, 장차 경찰 국가를 가능케 할 기술을 설치하는 것은 시민적 위생(civic hygiene) 관점에서 위험하다.\n데이터와 지식은 권력이며, 타인을 감시하면서 자신은 감시받지 않는 것은 강력한 권력이다. 기술 기업이 정치 권력을 노리지 않더라도, 축적된 데이터는 공적 감독 밖에서 사람들의 삶에 영향을 미치는 잠재적 권력이 된다.\n산업혁명과 정보화 시대: 데이터는 “정보 시대의 오염”이다\n정보화 시대는 산업혁명과 유사하게 장기적으로는 생활 수준을 높일 수 있으나, 단기적으로는 심각한 부작용이 발생할 수 있다. 산업혁명은 오염, 열악한 노동 환경, 아동 노동 등을 낳았고, 이후 규제와 안전장치가 구축되면서 사회 전체가 큰 이익을 얻었다.\n이와 유사하게, 정보화 시대에서 데이터 수집·사용·남용은 중대한 문제이며, 프라이버시 보호는 환경 보호에 비견될 수 있다. 데이터는 정보 시대의 “오염”이며, 이를 어떻게 관리·격리·폐기하는지가 정보 경제의 건강을 좌우한다.\n법과 자율규제: 균형과 문화 변화가 필요하다\n데이터 보호 법제는 개인 권리를 보존하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있다(예: 목적 제한, 최소 수집, 과잉 수집 금지). 그러나 인터넷 환경에서 실효성은 논쟁적이며, “가능한 많이 모아 나중에 쓰자”는 빅데이터 철학과 충돌한다. 동시에 의료 데이터 분석처럼 사회적 효익이 큰 영역에서는 과규제가 혁신을 방해할 위험도 있어, 기회와 위험의 균형이 어렵다.\n근본적으로는 다음 문화 변화가 요구된다.\n사용자를 최적화할 “지표”로 보지 않고, 존엄·대리권(agency)을 가진 인간으로 대한다.\n데이터 수집과 처리 관행을 자율적으로 절제하여 신뢰를 구축한다.\n사용자에게 데이터 사용 방식에 대한 교육과 투명성을 제공한다.\n데이터는 필요 기간만 보관하고, 필요가 끝나면 폐기한다(“영원 보관”을 당연시하지 않는다).\n정책만이 아니라 암호학적 접근 제어 등 기술적 수단으로 권한을 강제하는 접근을 고려한다.\n장 요약: 데이터플로우·무결성·감사·윤리\n본 장의 논의는 다음 흐름으로 요약된다.\n단일 도구가 모든 요구를 만족시키지 못하므로, 애플리케이션은 여러 컴포넌트를 조합해야 한다.\n배치 처리와 이벤트 스트림을 통해 시스템 간 데이터 변경을 흐르게 하여 데이터 통합 문제를 해결할 수 있다.\n일부 시스템은 기록의 원천(system of record)이 되고, 다른 데이터는 변환을 통해 파생된다(인덱스, 물질화 뷰, ML 모델, 통계 요약 등).\n파생을 비동기·느슨 결합으로 구성하면, 한 영역의 문제가 다른 영역으로 전파되는 것을 줄여 견고성과 장애 내성을 높인다.\n변환 단계의 변경은 입력 전체에 대해 재실행하여 출력 재파생이 가능하며, 이는 애플리케이션 진화를 쉽게 한다.\n분산 트랜잭션 대신, end-to-end 요청 식별자에 기반한 멱등성 및 비동기 제약 검증을 통해 강한 무결성을 더 확장 가능하고 견고하게 달성할 수 있다.\n제약 위반은 즉시 차단하거나, 사후 보정(Compensation)으로 처리할 수 있으며, 이는 실제 비즈니스와 잘 맞는다.\n무결성 검증을 위해 감사(auditing)를 도입하여 데이터 손상과 오류를 조기에 탐지해야 한다.\n마지막으로, 데이터 집약 애플리케이션은 윤리적 책임을 수반하며, 예측 분석·차별·감시·프라이버시 침해·유출·의도치 않은 결과를 고려해야 한다.\n엔지니어는 인간 존엄과 존중을 기반으로, 자신이 만들고 싶은 세계를 의식적으로 선택해야 한다.\n참고\n데이터 중심 애플리케이션 설계 12장",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나는 차가 없다. 미국 서부에서는 차가 없으면 이동하는 게 거의 불가능해서 미국 살 때는 정말 운전을 많이 했는데, 원래 운전하는 걸 싫어하고, 서울은 대중교통과 택시 인프라가 워낙 좋아서, 이제 대부분의 이동은 택시, 공유 킥보드, 그리고 대중교통으로 한다.\n타다 이동 서비스가 아마 2018년도 하반기에 출시됐는데, 나는 이 서비스가 나오자마자 이용했고, 지금도 거의 매일 이용하는, 아주 오래된 고객이다. 아마도 타다 고객리스트를 뽑아보면 이용 빈도 기준으로는 내가 상위 15% 안에 들어가지 않을까 생각한다. 타다가 처음 출시됐을 땐 정말 획기적이었다. 당시에 내가 한국 택시와 택시 기사들에 대해 불만이 상당히 많았고, 뭔가 새로운 이동 수단에 대한 갈망이 극에 다다랐을 때인데, 초기 타다 서비스는 이런 나의 모든 불만을 잠식하면서 내가 모빌리티 수단에 대해 원하는 모든 걸 제공 했다.\n더럽고 냄새나는 실내, 멀미 날 정도의 급출발과 급정차, 승차 거부, 안전벨트 미착용, 귀가 아플 정도의 아무말 대잔치 등이 당시 내가 택시를 탈 때마다 나를 짜증 나게 했던 불편함이었다. 내가 이런 부분에 대해서는 보통 이상으로 좀 까칠하고 예민하긴 하지만, 운전을 업으로 하는 분들이 고객의 안전에 대해 신경 쓰지 않고, 일반인보다 운전을 못 하는 건 문제가 있는 것이다. 이런 시기에 나타난 타다는 초반에는 나에게 감동을 주기까지 했다. 일반 택시보다 비쌌지만, 이 가격 차이에 대한 지불 의향이 나에게는 충분히 있었다.\n하지만, 타다 서비스가 시장에 나온 지 7년밖에 안 되는 현시점에서 나는 이제 타다를 그만 탈지 고민 중이다. 그동안 가격은 오히려 더 올랐는데 서비스는 정말 바닥으로 떨어져서 타다 넥스트의 경우 차만 크지, 일반 택시랑 똑같은 카테고리로 하락했다고 생각한다. 승차 이후 차 문이 열린 상태로 그냥 출발하고, 급출발과 급정차는 이제 너무 흔하고, 차량 내부도 냄새나고 지저분하여졌다. 굳이 돈을 더 많이 내고 계속 이용해야 할지 요새 좀 고민 중이다. 이제 타다에서 하차하자마자 ‘이 기사님 30일 동안 안 만나기’ 박스를 체크하는 것도 지쳤고, 정말로 이런 내 후기와 피드백이 서비스에 반영되는지도 잘 모르겠다.\n이제 전반적인 제품과 서비스로 돌아와 보자. 서비스의 품질을 지속적으로 유지하는 건 왜 이렇게 힘들까? 어떻게 하면 회사는 사용자가 많아지고 제품이 스케일 하면서 초반의 높은 품질을 계속 유지할 수 있을까?\n나도 제품을 만들어서 서비스를 운영하는 사람이 아니라서 잘 모르지만, 작게 시작했는데 이제 국민 브랜드가 된 우리 투자사의 성장 과정을 옆에서 봤던 경험을 잘 복기해보면, 대략 다음과 같은 포인트들이 중요하지 않을까 생각한다.\n일단 전사적인 개밥먹기를 매일 해야 한다. 내가 초반에 타다의 예찬론자가 됐던 이유도 아마 이 회사의 창업가분들과 초기 멤버분들이 매일 직접 서비스를 이용하면서 관리했기 때문일 것이다. 이건 타다뿐만이 아니라 모든 제품과 서비스에 동일하게 볼 수 있는 현상이다. 초반에는, 이 제품을 직접 만든 분들이 매일 사용하면서 불편한 점들을 직접 개선하기 때문에 시장의 만족도가 매우 높다. 하지만, 돈이 벌리기 시작하고, 고객들이 많아지고, 조직의 규모가 커지면서 모두 바빠지면서, 본인들이 만드는 서비스를 직접 사용해 보는 이 개밥 먹기 문화는 점차 없어지거나, 일부 조직원들만 하게 된다. 이러면서 현장으로부터 멀어지고, 서비스는 망가지는 것이다. 전 직원들, 특히 임원들이 본인들이 만드는 서비스를 매일 사용하면 품질이 웬만하면 떨어질 수가 없다.\n계속 타다 이야기만 해서 좀 미안하긴 하지만,,,요샌 탈 때마다 차량의 청결 상태, 기사의 손님 응대 태도, 운전의 안전 기준 등이 너무 차이가 난다. 초반에는 모든 차가 깨끗했고, 기사의 태도도 비슷했고, 타면 항상 물어보는 표준 질문들이 있었는데, 이제 이런 게 잘 안 지켜지면서 표준 운용 절차라는 게 없어진 것 같다. 내 기억으론 서비스 시작 초반에는 모든 타다 기사가 표준 운영 매뉴얼을 숙지하고, 누가, 언제, 어디서 타더라도 항상 동일한 품질의 탑승을 경험할 수 있었다. 본인들이 운영하는 서비스의 품질을 계속 유지하고 싶다면, 고객들에게 항상 같은 경험을 제공하는 아주 명확하고 구체적인, 문서화된 표준 운영 절차가 있어야 한다. 그리고 전 직원이 이 운영 절차를 숙지해야 한다.\n그리고 마지막으로, 고객들의 피드백과 리뷰를 적극적으로 수집하고, 이를 실제 서비스에 거의 실시간으로 반영해야 한다. 솔직히 타다를 비롯해 내가 사용하는 많은 제품과 서비스들이 시장과 고객의 피드백을 제품에 반영하는지 잘 모르겠다. 카카오 택시도 이 중 하나인데, 나는 지금까지 카카오로 호출한 블랙 외의 다른 택시가 맘에 들었던 적이 단 한 번도 없었고, 운행이 끝나자마자 적극적인 후기를 수십 번 제출했는데, 이게 반영이 되는지 잘 모르겠다. 타다가 요새 이 내리막길을 가고 있는 것 같아서 매우 안타깝다.\n이 중 가장 중요한 건 본인이 만드는 제품과 서비스를 하루 종일 사용하는 것이라고 생각한다. 그러면 서비스가 아무리 커져도, 품질이 유지되지 않을 수가 없다. 대표가 이렇게 하는데도 품질 유지가 안 된다면, 정말 거지 같은 서비스를 만들고 있고, 회사에 정말 문제가 많다는 뜻이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 유일하게 해마다 세우는 목표가 있는데, 한 해의 독서량이다. 해마다 50권의 목표를 설정하고, 책 종류와 분야는 특별히 가리지 않는 잡식성 독서를 하는데, 올해도 좋은 책을 많이 읽었고, 지금까지 55권을 읽었으니, 아마도 58권 정도로 올해를 마무리할 것 같다.\n최근 몇 해 동안 50권을 초과 독서했고, 어떤 해는 60권 넘게 읽어서 목표를 60권으로 설정해 볼 생각도 했는데, 그냥 한 주에 책 한 권씩, 일 년에 50권을 읽는 꾸준함에 집중하기로 했다. 이렇게 내가 일 년에 몇 권의 책을 읽었다는 글을 올리면, 책 많이 읽는 거 자랑하냐고 공격하는 분들도 있는데, 자랑하는 게 맞다. 다른 자랑도 아니고 책 많이 읽는 자랑은 세상에서 제일 뿌듯하고 아무리 많이 해도 과하지 않는 자랑이고, 솔직히 올해 책을 많이 읽은 내가 스스로 자랑스럽고 사랑스럽다. 물론, 자랑만 하려는 목적은 아니다. 50권의 목표를 설정한 첫해인 2017년에는 그냥 내가 그 해에 실제로 몇 권을 읽을 수 있을지 실험해 보려는 의도였는데, 이제 연초마다 50권의 목표를 설정하고, 연말에 실제로 몇 권의 책을 읽었는지 글로 정리하는 게 나만의 의식이 되었다. 이렇게 독서에 대한 글을 쓰면 책을 많이 읽으라는 압박을 스스로에게 하게 되는데, 이건 나에겐 아주 좋은 스트레스다.\n참 재미있는 게, 작년도 바빴고, 올해는 더 바빴는데, 바쁠수록 나는 책을 더 가까이했다. 책만 더 많이 읽은 게 아니라 운동도 더 많이 했고, 일반적으로 바쁘면 잘 못 하는 일들을 더 많이, 더 자주 했던 것 같다. 꾸준한 독서도 확실하게 한몫을 한 꾸준한 생활의 결과는 더 건강하고 스트롱한 몸과 마음인데, 모두에게 적극적으로 추천한다. 바빠서 책을 못 읽었고, 바빠서 운동을 못 했고, 바빠서 매일, 매주, 매달 해야 하는 일을 못 한 건, 바빴기 때문이 아니라 그냥 게을러서 안 했기 때문이다. 이건 의지의 문제이고 누구나 하면 할 수 있다.\n내 독서 습관은 몇 년 동안 그대로이다. 일단 나는 더 이상 전자책은 읽지 않고, 종이책만 읽는데, 종이책도 실제로 구매하지는 않고 빌리기만 한다. 내 기본 대여 플랫폼은 우리 투자사 국민도서관, 그리고 동네 도서관이다. 양쪽 모두 책을 반납하면 중간에 대여를 못 하는 기간이 며칠 생기는데, 이럴 때는 우리 사무실 구글캠퍼스에 있는 작은 도서관에서 책을 대여한다. 이 시스템을 잘 활용하면 1년 내내 내 곁에 책이 없는 날이 없어서 즐겁다. 좀 옛날 감성이긴 하지만, 책을 항상 가까이하면 기분이 좋고, 마치 부자가 된 느낌인데, 이 느낌은 그 어떤 행위도 대체해 줄 수 없어서 내가 종이책을 절대 포기하지 못하는 이유이기도 하다. 그래서 하루에 최소 15분은 책을 읽는 습관을 내재화하려고 노력하고 있다.\n책을 읽은 후 서평은 우리 투자사 플라이북에 차곡차곡 쌓아둔다. 올해 내가 플라이북에서 별 5개를 준 나의 최고 책들을 가장 최근에 읽은 순서로 나열하자면,\n조해진의 ‘겨울을 지나가다’\n리사 리드센의 ‘새들이 남쪽으로 가는 날’\n김애란의 ‘바깥은 여름’\n김신지의 ‘평일도 인생이니까’\n최은영의 ‘아주 희미한 빛으로도’\n이렇게 5권이다. 55권 중 5권이면 올해 읽은 책의 9%에 5점 만점을 준건데, 작년에 14권에 별 5개를 준 거에 비하면 굉장히 엄격한 평가다. 작년에 별점을 너무 후하게 준 것 같아서 올해는 별 5개의 기준을 나름 높게 잡기도 했고, 솔직히 올해는 엄청나게 감동을 받은 책이 많진 않기도 했다. 올해 별 5개를 준 작가들 조해진, 리사 리드센, 김애란, 김신지, 그리고 최은영은 글을 굉장히 잘 쓰고, 고유의 스타일과 색채가 강한 분들인데, 리사 리드센을 제외하면 모두 한국 작가들이고, 앞으로 이들의 작품들이 계속 기대된다. 이 중 김애란과 최은영은 노벨문학상을 받아도 나는 크게 놀라지 않을 것이다.\n올해도 내가 읽은 책들의 주제, 내용, 성향에는 특정한 패턴은 없고 그냥 이것저것 다 잡식성으로 읽었다. 내가 최근 몇 년 동안 많이 읽고 좋아하게 된 한국 작가들의 책이 많았고, 내가 관심 있는 주제에 관한 책도 많았는데, 총평하자면 그냥 평범한 에세이나 소설 위주의 한 해였다.\n우리 모두에게 평등하게 주어지는 하루 24시간은 우리 모두의 자본금이다. 독서는 절대로 손해를 볼 수 없는, 그 자본금을 가장 잘 활용할 수 있는 방법의 하나이다. 어떤 책이든, 독서는 그 책을 쓴 저자의 평생의 경험, 통찰력, 그리고 상상력을 약 5시간 만에 배운다는 건데, 이런 말도 안 되게 남는 장사는 그 어디에도 없다.\n내가 항상 강조하지만, 시간이 없고 바빠서 책을 읽지 못한다는 말은 세상에서 가장 한심한 변명이다.\n내년에도 50권의 책을 읽을 것이다.(스스로에게 하는 다짐).",

.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}리딩파티는 뉴욕에서 시작된 문화로, 한자리에 모여 책을 읽고 생각을 나누는 독서 커뮤니티예요. 책을 미리 읽고 와서 대화를 나누는 기존의 독서모임보다는 가벼워진 형태로, 같은 시간 동안 함께 책을 읽고 이야기를 나눈다는 게 매력이죠. \n매거진 담당 팀원들은 〈더 머니이슈〉 창간호 주제가 ‘1인분의 삶’이었던 만큼 같은 책을 읽고 서로의 생각을 나눈다면 매거진에 담긴 이야기가 더 깊어질 것이라 생각했어요.\n리딩파티 장소로 선택한 곳은 프릳츠 장충. ‘맛있는 빵과 훌륭한 커피는 사람을 행복하게 만든다’는 프릳츠의 철학은 ‘돈에 관한 시선이 바뀌면 삶은 변한다’고 말하는 〈더 머니이슈〉의 관점과 맞닿아 있어요. 프릳츠 장충의 아름다운 공간은 낯선 사람들과 마음 편히 대화를 나누기에 더없이 좋은 분위기였죠.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n세상에 없던 돈에 관한 매거진\n〈더 머니이슈〉\n〈더 머니이슈〉는 요즘 사람들을 위한 경제 정보지이자, 돈을 대하는 태도와 관점의 전환을 제안하는 라이프스타일 경제 매거진이에요. 매거진에는 누구나 한 번쯤 품었을 질문들이 담겨 있어요. 질문마다 실제로 무엇을 고려해야 하는지, 어디서부터 시작하면 좋은지, 어떤 선택이 내 삶과 이어지는지 차근차근 짚어줍니다.\n‘가진 돈이 한줌이어도 자산 관리는 필요할까?’, ‘연봉 1억 원을 찍으면 정말 행복해질까?’처럼 재테크 관점을 새롭게 제안하는 콘텐츠와 ‘인플루언서를 따라 산 새 옷은 내 취향일까?’, ‘좋아하는 일로 N잡을 시작해도 괜찮을까?’처럼 일상의 선택을 돌아보게 하는 콘텐츠가 가득해요.\n돈을 향한 실용적 해법과 새로운 시선을 따라 읽다 보면, ‘돈을 어떻게 바라보고, 어떻게 쓰며, 어떻게 살아갈 것인가’에 대한 기준이 선명해집니다.\n〈더 머니이슈〉를 읽으며\n1인분의 삶을 되돌아보는 시간\n11월 19일 오후 7시. 리딩파티에 초대된 50명의 참여자가 하나둘 입장했고, 마음에 드는 자리에 앉아 〈더 머니이슈〉를 읽으며 ‘1인분의 삶’을 되돌아보는 시간을 가졌습니다. \n각자의 방식으로 삶을 단단하게 일구고 있는 6인의 리딩파티 호스트는 〈더 머니이슈〉에 대해 이렇게 얘기했어요.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n시골쥐 (유튜브 ‘시골쥐의 도시생활’ 운영).css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}.css-1k9y0sc{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;}.css-1k9y0sc>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-1k9y0sc>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-1k9y0sc:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n요즘 청년들이 품고 있을 고민에 대한 해결책이 〈더 머니이슈〉에 담겨 있어 도움이 많이 될 것 같아요. 특히 다른 사람들은 어떻게 살아가는지 볼 수 있어서, 내가 걷고 있는 길에 대한 새로운 시야를 제안해줄 거라고 생각해요.\n\n김민경 (민음사 해외문학팀 출판편집자)\n재테크 관련 정보뿐만 아니라 재미있는 글들이 많았고, 천선란 작가님 소설도 있어서 반갑게 읽었습니다. 저처럼 경제나 재테크를 하고는 싶지만 아직 관심이 없는 2030에게 〈더 머니이슈〉를 추천하고 싶어요.\n\n홍상지 (중앙일보 IT산업부 기자)\n우리는 누구나 1인분의 삶을 살아가잖아요. 마침 이번 〈더 머니이슈〉의 주제가 ‘1인분의 삶’인데, 이에 대한 거의 모든 것을 다루고 있는 잡지라고 느꼈어요. 돈 뿐만 아니라 삶의 관점에 대해서도 다양한 각도로 다룬다는 점도 인상 깊었어요.\n\n전명희 (큐레이션 부동산 ‘별집’ 대표)\n돈이라는 주제를 단순히 투자나 저축같은 관점에서 접근하는 데서 끝나는 게 아니라 심리나 문화, 철학 등 다차원적으로 이야기하는 점이 신선했어요. 매달 돈을 벌면서 내 삶을 어떻게 성장시킬 수 있을까 고민하는 분에게 특히 추천하고 싶어요.\n\n고윤경 (여행 전문 서점 ‘책크인’ 대표)\n자기의 삶을 단단하게 만드는 법을 이야기하는 책 같아서 재미있게 읽었어요. 1인분의 삶을 단단하게 살아가고 싶은 분들이 읽으면 좋을 것 같아요.\n\n김짠부 (유튜브 ‘김짠부’ 운영)\n제 삶의 가장 중요한 키워드 중 하나는 ‘같이’예요. 유독 돈에 있어서 그 마음이 더 필요하더라고요. 그래서 누군가 나처럼 돈을 고민하고 있다는 사실만으로도 힘이 되는데, 〈더 머니이슈〉는 그런 사람들의 이야기가 한자리에 모여 있는 일종의 재테크 놀이동산 같아요. 만약 누군가에게 ‘재테크를 함께 이야기할 친구’가 필요하다면 이 책을 건네줄 거예요.\n\n.css-1lvcgm8{padding:22px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;border-radius:20px;}\n.css-13ko30i{width:375px;}〈더 머니이슈〉 살펴보기\n\n호스트와 함께\n생각을 나누는 시간\n김짠부의 ‘자산 관리 트렌드와 N잡’, 김민경의 ‘혼자를 기르는 법’, 홍상지의 ‘슬기로운 취향 소비 노하우’, 전명희의 ‘나에게 좋은 집 찾는 법’, 시골쥐의 ‘1억 원 모은 뒤 삶의 변화’, 고윤경의 ‘혼자 떠나는 여행’. 리딩파티 2부에서는 여섯 그룹으로 나뉘어 호스트와 함께 〈더 머니이슈〉에 나온 아티클을 중심으로 다양한 주제의 대화를 나눴어요.\n호스트와 참여자들은 혼자 안고 있던 돈 걱정을 털어놓고, 미래에 대한 불안을 나누고, 나만의 소비 취향을 자랑하며 서로의 이야기를 듣고 함께 고민했어요. 테이블마다 흥미로운 대화가 이어졌고, 어느덧 1시간이 훌쩍 지나 리딩파티는 막을 내렸습니다. 현장에서 느꼈던 다정한 분위기가 고스란히 담긴 참여자 분들의 생생한 후기를 소개할게요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n“저와 비슷한 분들과 생산적인 이야기를 나눌 수 있어서 좋았어요. 돈에 관심 있는 분들과 모이기가 쉽지 않은데 기회를 가질 수 있었던 것도 너무 좋았어요”\n\n“‘돈’ 이야기만 할 줄 알았는데 의외로 말랑말랑한, 살아가는 ‘삶’에 대한 이야기들이 오갔다. 내향인에게 이런 자리는 참 소중하다. 다정한 시선을 가진 사람들과 다정한 장소에서 다정한 이야기를 나누는 소중한 시간이었다. 집으로 돌아가는 길 코끝은 시렸지만 마음만은 따뜻했다”\n\n“신개념 출간회, 토스의 리딩파티! 처음 만난 사람들과 돈 얘기를 이렇게 솔직하게 나눌 수 있다는 게 너무 재밌고 도파민 터져버림. 돈이 가진 다양한 모양들 그리고 감정들.. 이런 시간이 더더더 많았으면 좋겠다.”\n\n“분야가 정말 다양한 필진들이 돈에 대해 이야기하는 흥미로운 책. 책뿐만 아니라 각종 굿즈까지 가득 안겨받은 선물 같았다. 프릳츠 빵과 커피를 즐기면서 호젓한 리딩파티. 결이 맞는 다정한 사람들과의 흥미로운 대화. 에너지를 가득 얻은 수요일 밤이었다.”\n\n‘머니이슈’라는 이름은 돈에 관한 매거진을 뜻하는 동시에 ‘돈에 관한 문제는 언제나 삶의 문제’라는 뜻을 품고 있어요. 돈은 늘 삶의 한가운데 있지만, 돈과 나의 관계 설정은 미숙해서 돈은 불안의 시작점이 되기도, 자유의 수단이 되기도 하잖아요. 〈더 머니이슈〉는 그 경계에서 흔들리는 우리를 위해 시작됐어요.\n이번 리딩파티에는 함께 하지 못했지만, 돈과 삶에 대한 문제를 고민하며 더 잘 살아갈 방법을 찾고 있다면 〈더 머니이슈〉를 읽어보세요. ‘머니 앤 라이프 밸런스’를 단단하게 잡아주는 데 도움이 될 거예요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Photo 이욱영",
