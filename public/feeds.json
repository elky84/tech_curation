        "content:encodedSnippet": "Managing and understanding large-scale data ecosystems is a significant challenge for many organizations, requiring innovative solutions to efficiently safeguard user data. Meta’s vast and diverse systems make it particularly challenging to comprehend its structure, meaning, and context at scale.\nTo address these challenges, we made substantial investments in advanced data understanding technologies, as part of our Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI). Specifically, we have adopted a “shift-left” approach, integrating data schematization and annotations early in the product development process. We also created a universal privacy taxonomy, a standardized framework providing a common semantic vocabulary for data privacy management across Meta’s products that ensures quality data understanding and provides developers with reusable and efficient compliance tooling.\nWe discovered that a flexible and incremental approach was necessary to onboard the wide variety of systems and languages used in building Meta’s products. Additionally, continuous collaboration between privacy and product teams was essential to unlock the value of data understanding at scale.\nWe embarked on the journey of understanding data across Meta a decade ago with millions of assets in scope ranging from structured and unstructured, processed by millions of flows across many of the Meta App offerings. Over the past 10 years, Meta has cataloged millions of data assets and is classifying them daily, supporting numerous privacy initiatives across our product groups. Additionally, our continuous understanding approach ensures that privacy considerations are embedded at every stage of product development. \nAt Meta, we have a deep responsibility to protect the privacy of our community. We’re upholding that by investing our vast engineering capabilities into building cutting-edge privacy technology. We believe that privacy drives product innovation. This led us to develop our Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI), which integrates efficient and reliable privacy tools into Meta’s systems to address needs such as purpose limitation—restricting how data can be used while also unlocking opportunities for product innovation by ensuring transparency in data flows \nData understanding is an early step in PAI. It involves capturing the structure and meaning of data assets, such as tables, logs, and AI models. Over the past decade, we have gained a deeper understanding of our data, by embedding privacy considerations into every stage of product development, ensuring a more secure and responsible approach to data management.\n\nWe embarked on our data understanding journey by employing heuristics and classifiers to automatically detect semantic types from user-generated content. This approach has evolved significantly over the years, enabling us to scale to millions of assets. However, conducting these processes outside of developer workflows presented challenges in terms of accuracy and timeliness. Delayed classifications often led to confusion and unnecessary work, while the results were difficult to consume and interpret.\nData understanding at Meta using PAI\nTo address shortcomings, we invested in data understanding by capturing asset structure (schematization), describing meaning (annotation), and inventorying it into OneCatalog (Meta’s system that discovers, registers, and enumerates all data assets) across all Meta technologies. We developed tools and APIs for developers to organize assets, classify data, and auto-generate annotation code. Despite significant investment, the journey was not without challenges, requiring innovative solutions and collaboration across the organization.\nChallenge\nApproach\n\n\nUnderstanding at scale (lack of foundation)\nAt Meta, we manage hundreds of data systems and millions of assets across our family of apps.\nEach product features its own distinct data model, physical schema, query language, and access patterns. This diversity created a unique hurdle for offline assets: the inability to reuse schemas due to the limitations of physical table schemas in adapting to changing definitions. Specifically, renaming columns or making other modifications had far-reaching downstream implications, rendering schema evolution challenging, thus propagation required careful coordination to ensure consistency and accuracy across multiple systems and assets. \nWe introduced a shared asset schema format as a logical representation of the asset schema that can be translated back and forth with the system-specific format. Additionally, it offers tools to automatically classify data and send out annotation changes to asset owners for review, effectively managing long-tail systems.\n\n\nInconsistent definitions (lack of shared understanding)\nWe encountered difficulties with diverse data systems that store data in various formats, and customized data labels that made it challenging to recognize identical data elements when they are stored across multiple systems.\nWe introduced a unified taxonomy of semantic types, which are compiled into different languages. This ensured that all systems can share the same canonical set of labels.\n\n\nMissing annotations (lack of quality)\nA solution that relied solely on data scanning and pattern matching was prone to false positives due to limited contextual information. For instance, a 64-bit integer could be misclassified as either a timestamp or a user identifier without additional context. Moreover, manual human labeling is not feasible at scale because it relies heavily on individual developers’ expertise and knowledge.\nWe shifted left by combining schematization together with annotations in code, in addition improving and utilizing multiple classification signals. Strict measurements provided precision/recall guarantees. Protection was embedded in everything we built, without requiring every developer to be a privacy expert.\n\n\nOrganizational barriers (lack of a unified approach)\nMeta’s data systems, with their bespoke schematization and practices, posed significant challenges in understanding data across the company. As we navigated complex interactions and with ever evolving privacy requirements, it became clear that fragmented approaches to data understanding hindered our ability to grasp data comprehensively.\nBy collaborating with asset owners to develop intuitive tooling and improve coverage, we tackled adoption barriers such as poor developer experience and inaccurate classification. This effort laid the groundwork for a unified data understanding foundation, which was seamlessly integrated into the developer workflow. As a result, we drove a cultural shift towards reusable and efficient privacy practices, ultimately delivering value to product teams and fostering a more cohesive approach to data management.\n\n\n\n\nWalkthrough: Understanding user data for the “Beliefs” feature in Facebook Dating \nTo illustrate our approach and dive into the technical solution, let’s consider a scenario involving structured user data. When creating a profile on the Facebook Dating app, users have the option to include their religious views to help match with others who share similar values.\n\nOn Facebook Dating, religious views are subject to purpose limitation requirements. Our five-step approach to data understanding provides a precise, end-to-end view of how we track and protect sensitive data assets, including those related to religious views:\n\nEven a simple feature can involve data being processed by dozens of heterogenous systems, making end-to-end data protection critical. To ensure comprehensive protection, it is essential to apply the necessary steps to all systems that store or process data, including distributed systems (web systems, chat, mobile and backend services) and data warehouses.\nConsider the data flow from online systems to the data warehouse, as shown in the diagram below. To ensure that religious belief data is identified across all these systems, we have implemented measures to prevent its use for any purpose other than the stated one.\n\nStep 1 – Schematizing\nAs part of the PAI initiative, Meta developed DataSchema, a standard format that is used to capture the structure and relationships of all data assets, independent of system implementation. Creating a canonical representation for compliance tools. Understanding DataSchema requires grasping schematization, which defines the logical structure and relationships of data assets, specifying field names, types, metadata, and policies.\nImplemented using the Thrift Interface Description Language, DataSchema is compatible with Meta systems and languages. It describes over 100 million schemas across more than 100 data systems, covering granular data units like database tables, key-value stores, data streams from distributed systems (such as those used for logging), processing pipelines, and AI models. Essentially, a data asset is like a class with annotated attributes. \nLet’s examine the source of truth (SoT) for a user’s dating profile schema, modeled in DataSchema. This schema includes the names and types of fields and subfields:\n  - user_id (uint)\r\n  - name (string)\r\n  - age (uint)\r\n  - religious_views (enum)\r\n  - photos (array<struct>):\r\n     - url (url)\r\n     - photo (blob)\r\n     - caption (string)\r\n     - uploaded_date (timestamp)\r\nDating profile DataSchema\nThe canonical SoT schema serves as the foundation for all downstream representations of the dating profile data. In practice, this schema is often translated into system-specific schemas (source of record – “SoR”), optimized for developer experience and system implementation in each environment. \nStep 2 – Predicting metadata at scale\nBuilding on this schematization foundation, we used annotations to describe data, enabling us to quickly and reliably locate user data, such as religious beliefs, across Meta’s vast data landscape. This is achieved through a universal privacy taxonomy, a framework that provides a common semantic vocabulary for data privacy management across Meta’s apps. It offers a consistent language for data description and understanding, independent of specific programming languages or technologies.\nThe universal privacy taxonomy works alongside data classification, which scans systems across Meta’s product family to ensure compliance with privacy policies. These systems use taxonomy labels to identify and classify data elements, ensuring privacy commitments are met and data is handled appropriately according to its classification.\nPrivacy annotations are represented by taxonomy facets and their values. For example, an asset might pertain to an Actor.Employee, with data classified as SemanticType.Email and originating from DataOrigin.onsite, not a third party. The SemanticType annotation is our standard facet for describing the meaning, interpretation, or context of data, such as user names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates, or locations. \nBelow, we illustrate the semantic type taxonomy node for our scenario, Faith Spirituality:\n\nAs data models and collected data evolve, annotations can become outdated or incorrect. Moreover, new assets may lack annotations altogether. To address this, PAI utilizes various techniques to continuously verify our understanding of data elements and maintain accurate, up-to-date annotations:\n\nOur classification system leverages machine learning models and heuristics to predict data types by sampling data, extracting features, and inferring annotation values. Efficient data sampling, such as Bernoulli sampling, and processing techniques enable scaling to billions of data elements with low-latency classifications. \nKey components include:\nScheduling component: manages the set of data assets to scan, accommodating different data system architectures by either pulling data via APIs or receiving data pushed directly into the scanning service.\nScanning service: processes and analyzes data from various sources by accumulating samples in memory, deserializing rows (e.g., JSON) into fields and sub-fields, and extracting features using APIs available in multiple languages (C++, Python, Hack). It ensures comprehensive data capture, even for ephemeral data.\nClassification service: utilizes heuristic rules and machine learning models to classify data types with high accuracy.\n\nHeuristic rules: handle straightforward, deterministic cases by identifying specific data formats like dates, phone numbers, and user IDs.\nMachine learning models: trained on labeled datasets using supervised learning and improved through unsupervised learning to identify patterns and anomalies in unlabeled data.\nGround truth calibration and verification: ensures system accuracy and reliability, allowing for model fine-tuning and improved classification performance.\nLineage and propagation: We integrate classification rules with high-confidence lineage signals to ensure accurate data tracking and management. Our propagation mechanism enables the seamless annotation of data as needed, ensuring that exact copies of data across systems receive equivalent classification. This approach not only maintains data integrity but also optimizes the developer experience by streamlining the process of managing data classifications across our diverse systems.\nStep 3 – Annotating\nThe integration of metadata predictions and developer input creates a comprehensive picture of a data asset’s structure (schema) and its meaning (annotation). This is achieved by attaching these elements to individual fields in data assets, providing a thorough understanding of the data.\nBuilding on the predicting data at scale initiative (step 2), where we utilize the universal privacy taxonomy and classification systems to identify and classify data elements, the generated metadata predictions are then used to help developers annotate their data assets efficiently and correctly.\nPortable annotation APIs: seamlessly integrate into developer workflows ensuring:\nConsistent representation of data across all systems at Meta.\nAccurate understanding of data, enabling the application of privacy safeguards at scale.\nEfficient evidencing of compliance with regulatory requirements.\nMetadata predictions and developer input: Two key components work together to create a comprehensive data asset picture:\nMetadata predictions: Classifiers generate predictions to aid developers in annotating data assets efficiently and correctly. If the confidence score exceeds a certain threshold, assignment can be automated, saving developer time.\nDeveloper input: Developers manually refine and verify annotations, ensuring that the data’s context and privacy requirements are accurately captured. Human oversight guarantees the accuracy and reliability of the data asset picture.\n- user_id (enum) \t\t→ SemanticType::id_userID\r\n  - name (string) \t\t\t→ SemanticType::identity_name\r\n  - age (uint) \t\t\t→ SemanticType::age\r\n  - religious_views (enum) \t→ SemanticType::faithSpirituality\r\n  - photos (array<struct>):\r\n     - url (url) \t\t\t→ SemanticType::electronicID_uri_mediaURI_imageURL\r\n     - photo (blob) \t\t→ SemanticType::media_image\r\n     - caption (string) \t\t→ SemanticType::media_text_naturalLanguageText\r\n     - uploaded_date (timestamp) → SemanticType::uploadedTime\r\n\nEnsuring complete schemas with annotations: To maintain a high standard of data understanding, we have integrated data understanding into our data model lifecycle. This includes auto-generating code to represent the schema of newly created assets when missing, ensuring that no new assets are created without a proper schema.\nFor example, in the context of our religious beliefs in Facebook Dating, we have defined its structure, including fields like ‘Name,’ ‘EmailAddress,’ and ‘Religion.’ Furthermore, we have annotated the asset with Actor::user(), signifying that the data pertains to a user of our products. This level of detail enables us to readily identify fields containing privacy-related data and implement appropriate protective measures, such as applying the applicable purpose limitation policy.\nIn the case of the “dating profile” data asset, we have defined its structure, including fields like ‘Name’: \nfinal class DatingProfileSchema extends DataSchemaDefinition {\r\n\r\n <<__Override>>\r\n public function configure(ISchemaConfig $config): void {\r\n   $config->metadataConfig()->description('Represents a dating profile);\r\n   $config->annotationsConfig()->annotations(Actor::user());\r\n }\r\n\r\n <<__Override>>\r\n public function getFields(): dict<string, ISchemaField> {\r\n   return dict[\r\n     'Name' => StringField::create(\"name\")\r\n        ->annotations(SemanticType::identity_name())\r\n        ->example('John Doe'),\r\n     'Age' => StringInt::create('age')\r\n        ->description(“The age of the user.”)\r\n        ->annotations(SemanticType::age())\r\n        ->example('24'),\r\n     'ReligiousViews' => EnumStringField::create('religious_views')\r\n        ->annotations(SemanticType::faithSpirituality())\r\n        ->example('Atheist'),\r\n   ];\r\n }\r\n}\r\n\nIn order to optimize for developer experience, the details of the schema representation differ in each environment. For example, in the data warehouse, it’s represented as a Dataset – an in-code Python class capturing the asset’s schema and metadata. Datasets provide a native API for creating data pipelines. \nHere is an example of such a schema:\n​​@hive_dataset(\r\n\t\"dim_all_dating_users\", // table name\r\n\t\"dating\", // namespace\r\n\toncall=\"dating_analytics\",\r\n\tdescription=\"This is the primary Dating user dimension table containing one row per Dating user per day along with their profile, visitation, and key usage information.\",\r\n\tmetadata=Metadata(Actor.User),\r\n)\r\nclass dim_all_dating_users(DataSet):\r\nds: Varchar = Partition(\"datestamp\")\r\nuserid: DatingUserID = Column(\"User id of the profile\")\r\nemail: EmailAddress = Column(\"User's email address\"),\r\n\tage: PersonAge = Column(\"User's stated age on date ds\")\r\n\treligious_views: ReligionOptions = Column(\"User's provided religious views\")\r\n\nOur warehouse schema incorporates rich types, a privacy-aware type system designed to enhance data understanding and facilitate effective data protection. Rich types, such as DatingUserID, EmailAddress, PersonAge, and ReligionOptions, are integrated into the schema, offering a comprehensive approach to data management while encoding privacy metadata. They provide a developer-friendly way to annotate data and enable the enforcement of data quality rules and constraints at the type level, ensuring data consistency and accuracy across the warehouse. For instance, they can detect issues like joining columns with different types of user IDs or mismatched enums before code execution. \nHere is an example definition:\nReligionOptions = enum_from_items(\r\n    \"ReligionOptions\",\r\n    items=[\r\n        EnumItem(\"Atheist\", \"Atheist\"),\r\n        EnumItem(\"Buddhist\", \"Buddhist\"),\r\n        EnumItem(\"Christian\", \"Christian\"),\r\n        EnumItem(\"Hindu\", \"Hindu\"),\r\n        EnumItem(\"Jewish\", \"Jewish\"),\r\n        EnumItem(\"Muslim\", \"Muslim\"),\r\n  ...\r\n    ],\r\n    annotations=(SemanticType.faithSpirituality,),\r\n)\r\n\nStep 4 – Inventorying assets and systems\nA central inventory system is crucial for managing data assets and their metadata, offering capabilities like search and compliance tracking. Meta’s OneCatalog is a comprehensive system that discovers, registers, and enumerates all data assets across Meta’s apps, providing inventory for easier management and tracking. \nKey functions of OneCatalog:\nRegistering all data systems: OneCatalog defines a data system as a logical abstraction over resources that persist data for a common purpose. It exhaustively examines resources across Meta’s environments to discover and register all data systems hosting data assets.\nEnumerating all data assets: Eligible data systems must enumerate their assets through the asset enumeration platform, generating a comprehensive list of assets and their metadata in the central inventory. These assets are grouped by “asset classes” based on shared patterns, enabling efficient management and understanding of data assets.\n\nGuarantees provided by OneCatalog:\nCompleteness: The system regularly checks for consistency between the data defined in its configuration and the actual data stored in the inventory. This ongoing comparison ensures that all relevant data assets are accurately accounted for and up-to-date.\nFreshness: In addition to regularly scheduled pull-based enumeration, the system subscribes to changes in data systems and updates its inventory in real time.\nUniqueness of asset ID (XID): Each asset is assigned a globally unique identifier, similar to URLs, which facilitates coordination between multiple systems and the exchange of information about assets by providing a shared key. The globally unique identifier follows a human-readable structure, e.g., asset://[asset-class]/[asset-name].\n\nUnified UI: On top of the inventory, OneCatalog provides a unified user interface that consolidates all asset metadata, serving as the central hub for asset information. This interface offers a single point of access to view and manage assets, streamlining the process of finding and understanding data.\nFor example, in the context of our “religious beliefs in the Dating app” scenario, we can use OneCatalog’s unified user interface to view the warehouse dating profile table asset, providing a comprehensive overview of its metadata and relationships.\n\nCompliance and privacy assurance: OneCatalog’s central inventory is utilized by various privacy teams across Meta to ensure that data assets meet requirements. With its completeness and freshness guarantees, OneCatalog serves as a reliable source of truth for privacy and compliance efforts.\nBy providing a single view of all data assets, OneCatalog enables teams to efficiently identify and address potential risks or vulnerabilities, such as unsecured data or unauthorized access.\nStep 5 – Maintaining data understanding\nTo maintain high coverage and quality of schemas and annotations across Meta’s diverse apps, we employed a robust process that involves measuring precision and recall for both predicted metadata and developer-provided annotations. This enables us to guide the implementation of our privacy and security controls and ensure their effectiveness.\nBy leveraging data understanding, tooling can quickly build end-to-end compliance solutions. With schema and annotations now front and center, we’ve achieved continuous understanding, enabling our engineers to easily track and protect user data, implement various security and privacy controls, and build new features at scale.\nOur strategy for maintaining data understanding over time includes:\nShifting left on creation time: We provided intuitive APIs for developers to provide metadata at asset creation time, ensuring that schemas and annotations were applied consistently in downstream use cases.\nDetecting and fixing annotation gaps: We surfaced prediction signals to detect coverage and quality gaps and evolved our prediction and annotation capabilities to ensure new systems and workflows were covered.\nCollecting ground truth: We established a baseline to measure automated systems against, with the help of subject matter experts, to continuously measure and improve them.\nProviding canonical consumption APIs: We developed canonical APIs for common compliance usage patterns, such as detecting user data, to ensure consistent interpretation of metadata and low entry barriers.\nPutting it all together\nComing back to our scenario: As developers on the Facebook Dating team collect or generate new data, they utilize familiar APIs that help them schematize and annotate their data. These APIs provide a consistent and intuitive way to define the structure and meaning of the data.\nWhen collecting data related to “Faith Spirituality,”the developers use a data classifier that confirms their semantic type annotations once the data is scanned during testing. This ensures that the data is accurately labeled and can be properly handled by downstream systems.\nTo ensure the quality of the classification system, ground truth created by subject matter experts is used to measure its accuracy. A feedback loop between the product and PAI teams keeps the unified taxonomy updated, ensuring that it remains relevant and effective.\nBy using canonical and catalogued metadata, teams across Meta can implement privacy controls that are consistent and effective. This enables the company to maintain user trust and meet requirements.\nIn this scenario, the developers on the Facebook Dating team are:\n\nSchematizing and annotating their data using familiar APIs.\nUsing a data classifier to confirm semantic type annotations.\nLeveraging ground truth to measure the quality of the classification system.\nUtilizing a feedback loop to keep the unified taxonomy updated.\nImplementing privacy controls using canonical and catalogued metadata.\nLearnings and takeaways\nBuilding an understanding of all data at Meta was a monumental effort that not only required novel infrastructure but also the contribution of thousands of engineers across all teams at Meta, and years of investment.\nCanonical everything: Data understanding at scale relies on a canonical catalog of systems, asset classes, assets, and taxonomy labels, each with globally unique identifiers. This foundation enables an ecosystem of compliance tooling, separating the concerns of data understanding from consuming canonical metadata.\nIncremental and flexible approach: To tackle the challenge of onboarding hundreds of systems across Meta, we developed a platform that supports pulling schemas from existing implementations. We layered solutions to enhance existing untyped APIs, meeting developers where they are—whether in code, configuration, or a UI defining their use case and data model. This incremental and flexible approach delivers value at every step.\nCollaborating for data classification excellence: Building the platform was just the beginning. The infrastructure and privacy teams also collaborated with subject matter experts to develop best-in-class classifiers for our data, addressing some of the most challenging problems. These include detecting user-generated content, classifying data embedded in blobs, and creating a governed taxonomy that allows every developer to describe their data with the right level of detail.\nCommunity engagement with a tight feedback loop: Our success in backfilling schemas and integrating with the developer experience was made possible by a strong partnership with product teams. By co-building solutions and establishing an immediate feedback loop, we refined our approach, addressed misclassifications, and improved classification quality. This collaboration is crucial to our continued evolution and refinement of data understanding. \nThe future of data understanding\nData understanding has become a crucial component of Meta’s PAI initiative, enabling us to protect user data in a sustainable and effective manner. By creating a comprehensive understanding of our data, we can address privacy challenges durably and more efficiently than traditional methods.\nOur approach to data understanding aligns closely with the developer workflow, involving the creation of typed data models, collection of annotated data, and processing under relevant policies. At Meta’s scale, this approach has saved significant engineering effort by automating annotation on millions of assets (i.e., fields, columns, tables) with specific labels from an inventory that are deemed commitment-critical. This automation has greatly reduced the manual effort required for annotation, allowing teams to focus on higher-priority tasks. \nAs data understanding continues to evolve, it is expected to have a significant impact on various aspects of operations and product offerings. Here are some potential future use cases:\nImproved AI and machine learning: leveraging data understanding to improve the accuracy of AI-powered content moderation and recommendation systems.\nStreamlined developer workflows: integrating data understanding into Meta’s internal development tools to provide clear data context and reduce confusion.\nOperational and developer efficiency: By automating data classification and annotation for millions of assets across Meta’s platforms, we can significantly improve operational efficiency. This automation enables us to leverage metadata for various use cases, such as accelerating product innovation. For instance, we’re now utilizing this metadata to help developers efficiently find the right data assets, streamlining their workflow and reducing the time spent on manual searches.\nProduct innovation: With a comprehensive understanding of data, Meta can drive product innovation by leveraging insights to create personalized and engaging user experiences.\nWhile there is still more work to be done, such as evolving taxonomies to meet future compliance needs and developing novel ways to schematize data, we are excited about the potential of data understanding. By harnessing canonical metadata, we can deepen our shared understanding of data, unlocking unprecedented opportunities for innovation not only at Meta, but across the industry.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees who have played a crucial role in developing data understanding over the years.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Kotlin Notebook is a new interactive environment for JVM developers. This article will cover the main Notebook features and how you can utilize them to improve your productivity. \nHow to use Kotlin Notebook\nKotlin Notebook is bundled with IntelliJ IDEA starting from the 2025.1 release, and it is easier than ever to start working with notebooks across various contexts. You can create notebooks in three main ways:\nCreating a notebook in a project\nFrom within a project, right-click the source root or a folder in the Project view, then choose New | Kotlin Notebook.\nThis will create an .ipynb file inside your project. Notebooks are generally placed in notebooks or samples subdirectories, but you can place them anywhere within your project.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a scratch notebook\nImagine you want to experiment with code without having to add new files to your project. The Scratch notebook should come in handy for this. To create a notebook that isn’t part of a specific project, follow these steps:\nUse the New Scratch File action (Cmd+Shift+N on macOS or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Insert on Windows/Linux).\nSelect Kotlin Notebook from the list.\n\n\n\n\nThis creates a file in the Scratches and Consoles | Kotlin Notebooks directory, and the notebook can be accessed across all projects, making it easy to store random pieces of code and refer to them whenever you need to.\n\n\n\n\nCreating a notebook from the Welcome screen\nYou can open or create a Kotlin notebook directly from the Welcome screen without even opening a project. Navigate to the Kotlin Notebooks tab and click New Notebook. You’ll be prompted to name the notebook and choose whether it should be saved as a scratch file or within a specified folder.\n\n\n\n\nBasics: Interactive cell execution and kernel control\nKotlin Notebook provides a familiar notebook interface within IntelliJ IDEA, making it easy to run code and manage the execution state. Each notebook consists of cells that can be executed independently or in sequence. The toolbar at the top of the notebook includes controls for running cells and managing the Kotlin kernel:\n\n\n\n\n\nRun a single cell: Click the Run button on the left of a code cell or press Ctrl+Enter/ Cmd+Enter. The cell’s code will run, and the output will appear directly beneath the cell. \nRun multiple cells: Click Run All to execute every cell in the notebook from top to bottom. If you want to run all cells below a certain point (for example, to resume from the middle of a notebook), you can right-click that cell and choose Run All Below. This flexibility lets you rerun the entire notebook or just a section without having to run each cell manually.\nInterrupt execution: If a cell is taking too long or has entered an infinite loop, click the Interrupt button (⏹). This stops the currently running cell without affecting the state of the already executed ones. It’s useful for pausing long-running computations or canceling mistaken operations.\nRestart or stop the session: Use the Restart Kernel button (🔄) to reset the Kotlin kernel. Restarting will terminate the current session and clear the runtime state, so all variables and imports become unresolved. This is helpful to ensure a clean slate (for example, if you want to run the notebook from scratch or recover from a bad state). You can also stop the session entirely by closing the notebook or using the standard Stop action in the Kotlin Notebook tool window, which shuts down the kernel process.\nConfigure Kotlin notebook: The gear icon on the toolbar opens the Kotlin Notebook settings, where you can adjust the notebook’s configuration. This settings panel lets you control the Kotlin kernel environment, such as the JDK or kernel version used.\nUsing these controls, you can execute code interactively and manage the notebook’s state, with each executed cell getting a number. \nThis is important because the notebook’s state depends on execution order, not just the linear order of cells. For example, if one cell defines a variable and a later cell uses it, you must run them in the correct sequence. Kotlin Notebook will help by marking cells with an asterisk if they haven’t been run yet, and by updating the execution count on each cell as you run it.\nSharing notebooks via Gist and Datalore\nOne of the advantages of using the standard .ipynb notebook format is the ease with which you can share your work. Kotlin Notebook provides convenient ways to share notebooks with others or publish your results online:\nGitHub Gist: You can quickly share your current notebook as a GitHub Gist. Simply click the Create Gist button (the icon with the GitHub logo) on the toolbar. The IDE will export your notebook to a Gist on your GitHub account and provide you with the URL, which you send to colleagues, knowing they can view the notebook on GitHub or download it. This is perfect for sharing a quick example or including notebook content in issues and forums. The Gist will contain the notebook in JSON format, which GitHub can render for preview. All code, output, and markdown from your Kotlin notebook are preserved.\n\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains Datalore: Because Kotlin Notebook uses the same file format and Kotlin Jupyter kernel as Datalore, JetBrains’ online data science notebook platform, your notebooks are fully compatible with it. You can simply upload the .ipynb file to Datalore to share it or continue working in the cloud. This means you can collaborate with others by simply moving the notebook to Datalore – no conversion needed. \nBy leveraging Gists for quick snippets and Datalore for cloud collaboration, Kotlin Notebook makes sharing results and prototypes effortless. Whether you’re posting a code snippet publicly or working on data analysis with a teammate, you can move from IntelliJ IDEA to the web and back without missing a beat.\nTesting REST APIs\nKotlin Notebook provides a powerful tool for backend and API developers: the ability to call and test RESTful APIs directly from your notebook, with full support for HTTP methods, JSON serialization, and IDE-based code completion. This is enabled through integration with Kotlin’s HTTP client, powered by Ktor.\nTo get started, simply add %use ktor-client to a code cell. This command pulls in a Ktor-based HTTP client and the kotlinx.serialization library, both of which are ready to use. After that, you have access to a pre-configured HTTP client instance in your notebook, available through the http variable.\nStrongly-typed HTTP calls: With the HTTP client integration, you can perform HTTP requests with Kotlin code and get typed results. For example, to fetch JSON data from an API, you might write:\nval response = http.get(\"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1\")\n\nresponse.bodyAsText()\nThis will perform a GET request and return the response as pretty-printed and highlighted JSON output.\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic JSON serialization: The notebook’s HTTP client is integrated with Kotlin Serialization, and your responses can be automatically deserialized:\n\n\n\n\nThe Ktor client integration will automatically handle class generation and JSON deserialization itself. This means you get a typed Kotlin object with proper fields, instead of manually dealing with JSON parsing. If you have a pre-defined data class, you can also call the body() method of a response with the appropriate type argument.\nUnder the hood, this feature relies on the open-source kotlin-jupyter-http-util library, which brings together the Ktor client and serialization for use in notebooks. In practice, it means your Kotlin notebook can act like a full-fledged HTTP client tool (akin to Postman or a REST client), but with the added benefit of being able to script and assert on the responses in Kotlin. This is extremely handy for trying out endpoints, testing microservices, or scraping web APIs – all within the comfort of IntelliJ IDEA.\nWorking with data: Tables and visualizations\nData explorers will feel at home in Kotlin Notebook. The 2025.1 release enhances how data is displayed and plotted, through tight integration with the Kotlin DataFrame library for tabular data and Kandy for charts. These integrations turn your notebook into an interactive data exploration tool.\nDataFrame integration – interactive tables\nWhen you add the DataFrame library, simply by putting %use dataframe in a cell, you gain access to a powerful DSL for data manipulation. It builds type information from the runtime the same way HTTP integration logic does, for example:\n\n\n\n\nAny time you display a DataFrame (for example, by evaluating a variable holding a table or by calling df.head()), Kotlin Notebook will render it using a special UI component rather than plain text. It offers:\nScrollable pagination: Large datasets are handled gracefully. Instead of trying to dump thousands of rows, the table output shows a limited number of rows per page and offers navigation controls.\nSortable columns: You can sort the table by a column with a single click on its header.\nHierarchical data drilling: If your DataFrame has nested data (for example, a column that contains another table or complex objects), you can expand that data inline. Click on cells that contain nested structures to drill down into sub-tables. This approach to exploration is great for hierarchical JSON datasets loaded into DataFrames.\nOpen in separate tabs: Sometimes you want to compare two tables side by side. You can now move a DataFrame output into its own tab within the notebook interface. Each table you open in a new tab stays accessible, so you can switch between multiple data views.\nExport to file: The output panel now has an Export button (💾). With a couple of clicks, you can export the displayed DataFrame to a file in common formats like CSV, JSON, or XML. This is useful if you’ve transformed some data and want to save the results. By default, the DataFrame will be saved to your project directory, but you can choose any location. The exported data respects the currently displayed state (for instance, if you’ve sorted the view by a column, the export will follow that sorted order, so you get exactly what you see).\n\n\n\n\nIt’s also possible to just drop a CSV onto your notebook: necessary code will be automatically generated and executed. You’ll be able to work with the loaded dataframe right away.\nWith Kotlin DataFrame, you can load CSV and JSON files, as well as SQL query results, into tables and then filter, aggregate, and transform them with Kotlin code. Kotlin Notebook will back you up by displaying each step’s result in a user-friendly way. It’s like having a mini data grid inside your IDE for instant feedback on your data manipulations.\nCheck out the official documentation to learn more about Kotlin DataFrame’s full capabilities.\nVisualizing data with Kandy\nNo data science notebook is complete without visualization. Kotlin Notebook integrates with Kandy, a plotting library built on LetsPlot by JetBrains and created by the Kotlin team to deliver the best experience when working with Kotlin DataFrame and Kotlin Notebook. Run %use kandy in a cell to load the Kandy library and enable its rendering support in the notebook. This allows you to create charts using Kandy’s simple, type-safe DSL and have them appear right below your code.\nFor example, you can quickly produce a line chart for a DataFrame, df, with the columns Year and Population:\n%use kandy\n\ndf.plot {\n\n    line {\n\n        x(Year)\n\n        y(Population)\n\n  width = 3.5\n\n  color = Color.LIGHT_BLUE\n\n    } \n\nlayout.title = \"Population Growth\"\n\n}\nWhen you execute this cell, a chart will be displayed in the notebook output area.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see many examples of charts in the Kandy documentation and gallery.\nExporting and copying plots: You can easily save your charts or copy them. Every plot output has an output menu (accessible via a small icon that appears at the top-right of the output when you hover over it). From this menu, select Export Plot As… to save the chart as an image file. \nIf you need to use the plot in another application immediately, you can choose Copy Plot, which will copy the chart image to your clipboard so you can paste it into a document or chat. This workflow makes sharing visual insights from your data trivial: run a cell to create a chart, then export or copy that visualization in just a couple of clicks.\n\n\n\n\nKandy’s plotting capabilities, combined with DataFrame, enable a smooth data exploration experience. You can load and prepare data in a table and then visualize patterns with a chart – all in Kotlin. You can even iterate, adjusting your data transformation and re-running the plot cell to see updates instantly. Kotlin Notebook ensures the charts render efficiently inside the IDE, so you don’t have to switch to an external browser for interactive visuals. For more advanced usage (like interactive plots or complex layouts), refer to the Kandy documentation, but for most needs, a few lines of Kotlin code will produce the desired chart.\nUsing JVM libraries and project code\nKotlin has a rich ecosystem of libraries and integrates seamlessly with Java. Kotlin Notebook embraces these strengths by allowing you to bring in external libraries or your project’s own code into a notebook session easily.\nAdding external libraries with %use and USE {}\nYou have two primary options when it comes to using a third-party JVM library (for example, an HTTP client, a CSV parser, or a machine learning toolkit) in your notebook:\nIntegrated libraries via %use: Kotlin Notebook comes with a collection of pre-defined library descriptors for many popular libraries (Kotlin DataFrame, Kandy, Ktor, KotlinDL, etc.). You can import these libraries with the magical  %use libraryName, without the need to think about dependencies! For example, as we saw, %use dataframe brings in the Kotlin DataFrame library and sets up its renderer, and %use ktor-client brings in Ktor and related utilities. We maintain a list of supported libraries and their descriptors on GitHub, and many community libraries are already integrated.\n\n\n\n\nUnintegrated libraries via Gradle syntax: If %use doesn’t support a given library, or you need to specify the version, you can still add it manually using a Gradle-style dependency block. Kotlin Notebook supports a special USE { ... } code block where you can declare repositories and dependencies, for example:\nUSE {\n\n    repositories {\n\n        maven(\"https://my.repo/url\")\n\n    }\n\n    dependencies {\n\n        implementation(\"com.example:my-library:1.2.3\")\n\n        implementation(\"org.apache.commons:commons-text:1.10.0\")\n\n    }\n\n}\nThis will fetch the specified Maven artifacts and add them to the notebook’s classpath. To fine-tune how libraries are resolved, use Kotlin Notebook options.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use either of these methods to load a library, the Kotlin Notebook kernel may perform additional integration steps if a descriptor or integration class is present. Read more about defining your own library integration.\nIf you add a library in one cell, code in subsequent cells can use it, but code in the same cell may not see it until after that cell is executed. A best practice is to put your %use commands or USE {} blocks at the top of the notebook or at least in their own cells. Also, if you ever restart the kernel, you’ll need to re-run those dependency cells to re-establish the classpath.\nPrototyping with project code and module dependencies\nKotlin Notebook can also interact with the code in your project, making it incredibly useful for prototyping and debugging. For example, if you have a large codebase, you can create a scratch notebook to experiment with your own APIs or data models interactively, without having to write a temporary main function or unit test.\nIn the 2025.1 release, using project code in notebooks has become easier, and there are more configuration options:\nModule classpath selection: By default, when you open a notebook file in an IntelliJ IDEA project, the notebook’s classpath will not include any project dependencies. However, you can also set the notebook up to depend on all project libraries or on a particular project module with all the dependencies inside it. Switch between these options using the combobox in the notebook’s toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\nUp-to-date code: Notebooks use the compiled classes from your project. To ensure that the latest compiled .class files are available, you should build your project before running a notebook. If you edit a source file in your project while the notebook is open, a notification will remind you to rebuild the module and restart the notebook to see the changes take effect in the notebook’s output.\nIntegrations: If your project defines any integration classes for a Kotlin notebook in the module your notebook depends on, those integrations will also be loaded.\nKotlin Notebook’s approach to libraries and dependencies allows you to incorporate whatever you need – be it a well-known library or your own code – and use it interactively. Because Kotlin notebooks have access to your project code, you can do things like instantiate your application’s classes, call functions from your business logic, or run quick experiments on your data models. You can even use notebooks to write exploratory tests against your APIs, since notebooks allow you to run code in any order and inspect the results, which can be more flexible than a fixed unit test.\nWhat’s next?\nThe next article will tell you about Kotlin Notebook’s advanced features. Stay tuned!\nIf you have any questions or suggestions, you can:\nAsk them right under this post.\nYouTrack: Create a #ktnb ticket to report bugs or suggest features.\nSlack: Check out #notebooks for discussions and questions.\nEmail: Email teodor.irkhin@jetbrains.com with any suggestions or requests for functionality that would allow you to incorporate Kotlin Notebook into your workflow.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Code completion has always been a defining strength of JetBrains products. So, when adding AI into our products, we knew it had to deliver top-tier code completion. This post covers how we trained the model behind our cloud-based completion.\nInitial research: What about obvious model options?\nWe started by testing both closed-source LLMs via APIs and open-source alternatives. But we quickly hit some roadblocks:\nAs we were aiming for on-the-fly completion, typical chat LLMs proved themselves impractical due to high costs and substantial latency. Such models were also missing critical code completion features, like fill in the middle (FIM) and token healing. \nChat models also tend to provide their outputs in inconsistent format, making it harder to properly process the response and insert suggestions in the editor.\nOne of our biggest concerns was the lack of transparency about the data used for training, which could lead to potential risks related to the use of licensed code. While some open-source models do offer transparency in their data sources, we opted not to use them due to production stability issues.\nMellum: A bird’s-eye view of the model\nAfter evaluating our options, we concluded that a relatively small in-house code completion model was the way to go. We set a goal of training a high-quality model with reasonable inference costs and latency using transparent data. We determined that staying under 4B parameters would allow us to support efficient inference for all users. Additionally, since our model has been trained primarily on code, its token vocabulary is specialized for coding tasks. \nTo train the model, we implemented a three-stage process, with each stage bringing in new knowledge and improving the generation quality. We started with basic pre-training on a large corpus of standalone files and then fine-tuned on a smaller number of contextual examples. Finally, to align the model to our product needs and remove undesired generations, we used reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF). \nLet’s take a look at the training steps in detail.\nPre-training stage\nTo avoid risks connected with training data, we started training from scratch. The goal of the pre-training stage was to introduce the model to a wide variety of languages, make it learn the syntax, patterns, and general programming concepts. \nDataset\nWe used TheStack as the main source of code data in various languages. It’s not fully up to date, but we addressed this by collecting additional data with fresh code, filtering it by repo and files licenses and cleaning it of personal identifiable information (PII). This ensures that our dataset is both legally compliant and useful.\nPre-training process\nFor pre-training, we sampled our combined dataset multiple times to reach approximately 3 trillion tokens. We used an 8192-token context window and split the dataset into chunks of matching size. For half of the files in each chunk, we applied a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) transformation. This involves splitting the file into three parts (prefix, middle, and suffix), then rearranging them so that the model learns to predict the missing middle segment given the surrounding context. This technique encourages the model to consider both the preceding and following code when generating suggestions, which better mimics real-world usage in code editors.\nThe pre-training was conducted on a cluster of 16 nodes with 8 H100 GPUs each, and it took about 15 days to complete. The result was our 4B-parameter Mellum-base model. For comparison, 100M code completion models, which we deploy locally in JetBrains IDEs, typically train in about a week on a single 8 H100 GPUs node.\nThe pre-training produces a general-purpose code completion model with broad knowledge across many programming languages. However, at this step the model is trained to achieve one simple objective: prediction of the next token in a randomly selected segment of a file. Without more context, the model won’t understand your code structure and won’t know when to stop generating.\nThese limitations are precisely what the fine-tuning stage is designed to address.\nContext-aware fine-tuning\nBetter fill-in-the-middle examples\nUnlike pre-training – where we randomly select chunks of code for prediction – fine-tuning focuses on slicing the code in more meaningful ways, i.e. by extracting fragments you’re more likely to see “in the wild”.\nThe visual below illustrates this approach. The code shown in blue is what we ask the model to predict. In the second example, for instance, the selected fragment stays within the scope of a single function. This setup better reflects a typical user scenario.\n\n\n\n\nBuilding contextual examples\nEven with improved fill-in-the-middle splitting, we’re still operating within the scope of a single file, which doesn’t accurately reflect how most developers work. In practice, completing code often requires an understanding of surrounding files and broader project context.\nOne of JetBrains’ superpowers is expertise in symbol resolution, usage search, and other IDE tooling. So, for the sake of scalable data pre-processing, we launched an internal project called Code Engine: a cross-platform SDK providing a lightweight, high-performance CLI tool designed to collect contextual information directly from plain files, without requiring the project to be indexed. Such an SDK allowed us to build contextual examples across thousands of repositories on the internal MapReduce cluster in a reasonable amount of time.\nHowever, finding the right algorithms took some trial and error. Here are a few examples to give you an idea of some of the challenges we had to overcome while trying to find the best context collection approach for our model: \nSorting files that are most similar by Jaccard distance on lines\nUsing files from import statements\nCreating a repomap\n…and much more. \nLanguage-specific fine-tuning\nWe hypothesized that smaller models like ours could benefit significantly from specialization. While the base model is trained on over 80 programming languages, most users typically work with just one or two (e.g. Java or Python). As a result, we fine-tune separate models for some of the most popular languages, allowing them to better capture language-specific patterns, libraries, and developer workflows:\nmellum-all – supports the majority of languages and dialects available in JetBrains’ IDEs, but the completion quality is slightly lower than that of specialized models\nmellum-python – specialized for Python and Jupyter\nmellum-jotlin – specialized for Java and Kotlin\nmellum-web – specialized for the web (coming soon!)\nRefining with RLAIF\nThe final step in our training pipeline focuses on removing undesired behaviors due to misalignment between the model’s training objectives and user expectations. For instance, from a training perspective, it’s perfectly valid to generate placeholders like TODO(“Not implemented”) or pass since these patterns are common in public code repositories. However, these are not likely to be helpful as actual code completion suggestions.\nTo address such issues, we apply an additional training phase using reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF), incorporating synthetic data crafted from rules and model-generated preferences. We construct a dataset of completion pairs in two main categories:\nRule-based completion pairs: We take real examples from our dataset and deliberately degrade them – replacing meaningful code with generic placeholders like pass, comments, or TODO statements.\nMellum-generated completion pairs: For a given prompt, we generate two completions – one with low temperature (more deterministic and often higher quality), and another with high temperature (typically more erratic or lower quality). We then use an external LLM to rank the two completions, producing a labeled positive-negative pair.\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset is then used to train the model to better reflect user preferences. Currently, we use the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm, which makes the model more inclined to generate positive or preferred completion examples.\nThis approach not only increases the evaluation score but also reduces the number of annoying generation artifacts.\nHow good is Mellum?\nSpoiler: the model performs extremely well for its size! Here’s how we evaluated it:\nFirst, we evaluated our models on the internal benchmark that we call “JetBrains BigCode”.\nThen, we ran our models on well-known public benchmarks like SAFIM.\nFinally, we measured the user-centric metrics by leveraging feature usage logs.\nBelow, we break our feedback loops down into two categories: offline evaluation (with pre-determined datasets) and online evaluation (with real user data).\nOffline evaluation\nDiscussing datasets is always nice, but what about the metrics?\nWhile creating the dataset is challenging enough, it’s even more challenging to create a good metric that compares the ground truth completion with the one proposed by the neural model. We did a little research and ended up with a combination of two main metrics:\nEM:\n\nExact match – a popular choice for code completion evaluation.\nThe prediction is considered good if the first line of the completion matches the first line of the ground truth with minimal pre-processing. \nKK:\n\nThe metric was named after its authors, Karol and Katya, who designed it and manually annotated the threshold-estimating dataset.\nThe number of suggested lines that are found in the ground truth, divided by the total number of lines in the suggested completion.\nWe also use some additional evaluation techniques, including chrF and LLM-as-a-Judge, for comparing the model variations, but we won’t be covering them here for the sake of keeping the blog post concise. Keep following our updates for more!\nJetBrains BigCode\nWe evaluated the model using a benchmark dataset derived from our internal tool, JetBrains BigCode, covering the most popular languages supported by Mellum – including Python, Kotlin, and Java. We ensured that our evaluation dataset has no overlap with the training dataset and transformed it to the FIM structure with contexts gathered using Code Engine.\nOne of the key advantages of the JetBrains BigCode dataset is its ability to slice code snippets based on various features, such as repository topic, popularity, age, whether the code is main or test code, and recent activity (e.g. commits in the past year). This is done for two primary reasons. First, a well-performing model should demonstrate strong results across all these slices, not just on a subset of them. Second, public benchmarks often end up in model training datasets over time, leading to evaluation contamination. To mitigate the latter risk, we designed our age and activity slices to better reflect real-world conditions. \nAs a result, by maintaining full control over our dataset rather than relying on public benchmarks, we can more reliably assess model quality across different coding styles and practices. According to our experiments on JetBrains BigCode, the complicated nature of the base model does pay dividends in terms of performance. So, it’s demonstrably a good idea to have a strong base model, then fine-tune it, and then align it with DPO.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, our JetBrains BigCode evaluation runs show that we are in good company with well-known battle-tested polyglot models, while being smaller and more efficient. Of course, larger models do outperform us, but they come with significantly higher serving costs, making them less practical for our products.\nSingle-line suggestions quality (EM metric)\n\n\n\nPublic benchmarks\nBesides evaluation on an internal dataset, we compared the capabilities of our models on different public benchmarks like multilingual benchmark SAFIM (syntax-aware fill in the middle). Stay tuned as we will share benchmarks data for Mellum soon!\nThat said, it’s important to remember that benchmarks like JetBrains BigCode and SAFIM, while valuable for scalable offline evaluation, don’t fully capture the experience of a real developer using the model. And ultimately, that’s who we’re building for.\nOnline evaluation\nTo ensure a positive impact on the user experience, we measure several metrics on the feature usage logs, following the same pipeline we described in the paper Full Line Code Completion: Bringing AI to Desktop.\nLong story short, our main metric is called ratio of completed code (RoCC). It is defined as a ratio of symbols of code written with code completion among all code written in the editor. We generally try to optimize for this metric. The core idea and motivation are simple: the more generated text appears in the editor, the better our code completion is. The good thing about the RoCC is that we can vary the number of code completion contributors that we account for. This allows us to, for instance, calculate a general in-editor RoCC or Mellum-specific RoCC.\nAnother important metric is the acceptance rate (AR), which is the number of accepted suggestions divided by the number of all shown suggestions. This metric is widely used in the community and is also fairly intuitive: the more users accept our suggestions, the better.\nBelow, we provide some online metrics data for various popular languages:\n\nRoCC (Mellum + standard completion)RoCC (only Mellum)AR\nJava46%23%35%\nKotlin45%25%31%\nPython32%23%35%\nJS/TS39%23%32%\nC#45%18%32%\nGo45%30%44%\nPHP40%26%34%\nRust37%24%35%\n\n\n\n\n\nOutcomes and what’s next for Mellum\nThis was a challenging journey for our ML team, but it resulted in one general completion model and several specialized ones that are all available via the JetBrains AI platform and are currently powering code completion inside JetBrains AI Assistant. To conclude the blogpost, here are our few next steps:\nAs mentioned earlier, we are currently working on a specialized model for web development languages that should further boost quality for various languages, and we plan to make this publicly available at some point in the near future.\nWe would also like to scale the number of parameters further, introducing more diverse data to the training set at the same time. This way Mellum becomes capable of other AI-for-code tasks as well. Keep in mind that service performance remains a key for us, so we expect to stay within reasonable size boundaries as we expand the model. \nTry coding with Mellum and share your impressions with us!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In this blog post, we will look at how to debug Java code using the IntelliJ IDEA debugger. We will look at how to fix a failing test, how to find out where an `Exception` is thrown, and how to find problems with our data. And we will learn some neat tricks about the debugger in the process! \nTo illustrate using the debugger, we will use a small example application that reads test scores from a CSV file, calculates the average score per student, and prints the results to the console. If you’d like to follow along, you can find the code here. \nDebug a failing test\nOne reason you might need the debugger is when one of your tests fails. In our example application, when we run the tests in `StudentTest`, we see that there is a failing test.\nFailing test\n\n\n\nCurrently, this test fails because the expected average does not match the result of the method `getAverageScore()`, as we can see on line 127. We can use the debugger to find out what the problem is and how to fix it. Let’s navigate to this method so we can set a breakpoint there to see what happens.\nSet a breakpoint\nWe can navigate to the method `getAverageScore()` using Jump to Source (⌘↓ on macOS / F4 on Windows/Linux) when our cursor is on the method. We can place a breakpoint, either by clicking in the gutter or using the shortcut (⌘F8 on macOS / Ctrl+F8 on Windows/Linux). Place the breakpoint on the first line of the method (line 50).\nBreakpoint in method\n\n\n\nRun in Debug mode\nWhen we run the test in Debug mode (⌃D on macOS / Shift+F9 on Windows/Linux), execution will stop when it hits the breakpoint, so that we can look at the state of our application. We see inline debugging information in the editor.\nRun in Debug mode\n\n\n\nHere we see that the list of `testScores` has `size = 3`. We can even click in the editor to expand this list to see details of the values in the list. We also see that `testScores.isEmpty()` evaluates to `false`, and therefore the `return` statement inside that `if` statement is unreachable and greyed out.\nIn the Debug tool window (⌘5 on macOS / Alt+5 on Windows/Linux), we see the call stack (the methods that were called) on the left. We can also see information about objects and variables, like the student and their test scores, in this example.\nDebug tool window\n\n\n\nStepping through the application\nNow, we can step through the code to see what happens, using different step actions.\nUse Step Over (F8) to step over a line and go to the next line, or use Step Into (F7) to step into a method that is called on a line. In this example, we can step into `getTestScore()` – which isn’t very interesting. When we step into a method, we can continue stepping to return to the call site once we exit the method, or use Step Out (Shift F8) to return right away. Notice that the variables and values that are shown inline and in the Debug tool window are updated as we step through the program.\nStep through the program\n\n\n\nOnce all the scores have been added, we see that the` totalScore` is 25. And here, we see the problem with our logic: we forgot to divide by the number of test scores!\nEvaluate expression\nTo fix our problem, we need to divide the total score by the number of test scores. To make sure our intended fix is correct, we can use Evaluate Expression. Right-click on `totalScore` in the editor to open the context menu and select Evaluate Expression. Alternatively, use the shortcut ⌥F8 on macOS / Alt+F8 on Windows/Linux.\nEvaluate Expression\n\n\n\nIf we evaluate `totalScore`, we get 25.0, as we can already see in the debugger. However, we can use Evaluate Expression to evaluate other expressions, even ones not currently part of our code. Here we can try out potential solutions. For example, if we evaluate `totalScore / testScores.size()`, we get “8.333333333333334”, which is the expected average. \nEvaluate Expression\n\n\n\nApply fix and rerun tests\nLet’s apply our fix to the code to return `totalScore / testScores.size()` instead of `totalScore` from the method `getAverageScore()`. When we rerun the test, we see that it now passes. Note that you might want to run all tests to make sure that your fix has not had any unintended side effects.\nTest passed\n\n\n\nSince we no longer need the breakpoint, we can remove it, either by clicking the breakpoint in the gutter or by using the shortcut ⌘F8 on macOS / Ctrl+F8 on Windows/Linux.\nRun the application\nNow that we’ve fixed our failing test and all the tests pass, let’s see if our application works correctly. Go to the `Main` class and run it, for example, by clicking the Run button in the gutter.\nDebug an Exception\nWhen we run the application, we see that there seems to be another problem! Our application throws a `DateTimeParseException`, with the message `Text ‘8.7’ could not be parsed at index 0`. Let’s use the debugger to find out what’s wrong. \nDateTimeParseException\n\n\n\nNote that we can create a breakpoint right from the console, by clicking the link Create breakpoint. This opens the Breakpoints dialog, where an Exception Breakpoint has been added for the `DateTimeParseException`.\nCreate Exception Breakpoint\n\n\n\nNow, when we run our application in Debug mode, execution will stop when and where this exception is thrown, so we can figure out what caused it. Execution stops in the `DateTimeFormatter` class. When we expand the `Exception` in the Debug tool window, we see that the `detailMessage` is “Text “8.7” cannot be parsed as a `DateTime`”. That makes sense, as the number 8.7 does not represent a valid date.\nReset frame\nTo find out where the incorrect value comes from, we can go back in the call stack. The call stack is shown in the left pane of the Debug tool window. We see a round arrow in front of the last method that was called. When we hover over this arrow, we see the option to Reset Frame.\nReset Frame\n\n\n\nWe can use Reset Frame to go back to the previous frame. Let’s do so until we get to the point in our code where we try to parse this value into a date. We will need to drop several frames until we get back to our own code. We see that we try to parse a `LocalDate` on line 38 of our `Main` class.\nNote that there are limitations to using Reset Frame; it only resets local variables, not static and instance variables. It also won’t undo any side effects of your application, like console output. While this is not relevant in the current example, you should be aware when you use Reset Frame in the future.\nWe are trying to parse a part of a line from our CSV file. Each line has been split into parts. To see all parts of the current line, click the View link next to the `parts` variable in the Debug tool window. Here we see that “8.7’ is actually a test score, as you might have guessed. We can also see that the line does contain a date, but it is in the next part of the line.\nReset Frame\n\n\n\nAs we can see in our code, we are parsing the same part of the line (`parts[3]`) twice! This looks like a copy-paste error! We should be parsing the part of the line that contains the date, which is `parts[4]`. Let’s fix that by changing line 38 to `var testDate = LocalDate.parse(parts[4]);`\nNote that we could have also gone directly to this line in the code from the console, by clicking the link “Main.java:38” in the console. However, it is useful to know how to set a breakpoint for an exception in case you ever need it.\nGo to line in code from console\n\n\n\nPrint to the console\nIn fact, while we’re here, let’s make sure that we are parsing all the parts of the lines correctly. \nAs we can see in the code just above (on line 25), our CSV file contains a header. Let’s print this header to the console to make sure we parse each part of the line to the correct field. We could add a `System.out.println()` to our code to print the header, but we don’t want to risk print statements ending up in production! Fortunately, there is a better way to do so.\nNon-suspending logging breakpoint\nLet’s create a non-suspending breakpoint, which means that execution will not stop on this breakpoint, and set it to log the line to the console when the breakpoint is hit.\nTo do so, create a breakpoint on line 27. Right-click the breakpoint and click More to open the Breakpoints dialog. Unselect Suspend to make this a non-suspending breakpoint. Next, select Log and Evaluate & log. Set the Evaluate & log field to `”Header: ” + line` and click Done. Notice that the breakpoint is yellow, to signify that this is a non-suspending breakpoint.\nNon-suspending breakpoint\n\n\n\nNow, when we run the application in Debug mode, we see that the header is printed to the console. But so are all the other lines from the file. To print only the header, the breakpoint should be on the next line. We could set a new breakpoint there, but then we’d have to redo the configuration…\nDrag and drop breakpoint\nInstead of creating a new breakpoint, we can drag and drop the existing breakpoint to the next line, preserving its configuration. \nDrag and drop breakpoint\n\n\n\nNow, when we run the application in Debug mode, only the header is printed to the console. Along with the output of our program, of course. It looks like our fields correspond correctly to the headers of the file.\nChecking the functionality of the application\nLet’s run our application again to see if everything is now as it should be. We see that the application runs without errors, but it looks like one of the students has a negative average test score.\nNegative average score\n\n\n\nThat can’t be right! Let’s see what’s going on. We’ll set a breakpoint in the code where we add test scores to the student (line 45 in `Main.java`). When we run our application in Debug mode, execution will stop every time this breakpoint is hit. We can click the Resume Program button (⌥⌘R on macOS / F9 on Windows/Linux), either in the Debug tool window, or inline in the editor, to get to the next test score.\nResume program\n\n\n\nEvery time we click the Resume Program button, we can see the values change both in the inline debugging information in the editor and in the Debug tool window. Execution will stop every time it hits this breakpoint, so for every test score. Since there are a lot of test scores in the file, this is going to take a while… \nResume program\n\n\n\nConditional breakpoint\nAs we are only interested in the test scores for a particular student, we don’t need execution to stop for each test score. Instead of clicking the Resume Program button many times in a row to get to the scores we’re interested in, we can use a conditional breakpoint – which will only halt execution under certain conditions.\nRight-click the breakpoint to open the Line Breakpoint dialog and edit the configuration for the breakpoint. Since we don’t need execution to suspend until we process this particular student’s test scores, we can set the field Condition to `studentName.equals(“Olivia Garcia”)` and click Done. \nConditional breakpoint\n\n\n\nNotice that the breakpoint has a small question mark in it, to signify that it is a conditional breakpoint. Now, when we resume our program, execution will stop only once we get to the test scores for the student whose name we have set in the condition. Here we can see that the test score is negative.\nNegative test score\n\n\n\nAdd watch\nTo see whether all test scores for this student are negative, let’s add a watch to the field `testScore`. Adding a watch makes it easier to explicitly watch the value of a field. Right-click on the variable `testScore` in the Threads & Variables tab in the Debug tool window and select Add to watches from the context menu. The watch will be shown in the right pane of the Debug tool window. \nAdd to Watches\n\n\n\nIf needed, select the Layout Settings icon at the top right of the Debug tool window and select Watches in the list, to show watches in the right pane.\nAdd Watches to Debug tool window\n\n\n\nWhen we click Resume Program and loop over this student’s scores, we see that all her scores are negative. That would explain her negative average… \nThis looks like a problem with the input data. Let’s open the CSV file to correct the scores and make sure Olivia’s scores are no longer negative. We can use multiple carets to fix all scores at the same time.\nIn this example, we can fix our input data ourselves. If you are dealing with user input that you can’t change, consider adding validation to the code, for example, that test scores cannot be negative.\nFinal check\nLet’s run our application one more time to see that everything is in order. We see that average scores are printed to the console for all students, and none of the scores are negative. This is how our application is expected to work. \nFinal check\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we’ve seen how to use the debugger to find and fix several types of bugs, from problems with the logic in the code, to reasons that exceptions are thrown, and finding problems with input data.\nIs there anything else you’d like to learn about the debugger?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We recently released some new AI features for the JetBrains Academy plugin. Learners will now be able to use machine translation of course content, theory lookup, and AI hints for Kotlin courses.\nAt first glance, these might seem fairly tame. There are no big LLM integrations, JetBrains AI Assistant is not being marketed toward beginners, and we are even considering disabling AI features in beginner programming courses by default at the request of our learners.\nDuring a time when many companies (including JetBrains) are embracing AI for developer productivity, these choices may seem strange. Shouldn’t students be learning to work with these tools from the beginning? Shouldn’t they be adapting to our new AI world?\nOur choice to move slowly and thoughtfully with regards to our educational AI features is intentional and assisted by our incredible research team. We recognize that LLMs can be incredibly useful to aid understanding of new concepts. However, we also think it is important to understand how these tools help and hurt learners, because there is good evidence they have the potential to do both. \n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to help guide learners during this time, we wrote four blog posts about learning to code in an AI world. This is the first in the series, keep an eye out for the next ones on our blog in the coming months.\nContents\n\nIs it still worth learning to code?\nWhat is computational thinking and how can you develop it?\nHow will careers in programming evolve with AI?\n\nIs it still worth learning to code?\nYes. Aside from its current utility in building software, coding builds computational thinking, strengthens problem-solving skills, and reinforces abstract concepts that are important in many disciplines. Programming skills help demystify the digital worlds we inhabit while giving you the power to actively shape and contribute to them.\nMost experts expect AI to augment future programming jobs, not replace them. Although AI-generated code is becoming increasingly prevalent, skilled people still need to review, debug, and take accountability for the quality of said code. How much of a technical foundation will they need to be able to do that? The safe answer is everything a traditional coder knows. Organizations are willing to pay for this level of expertise because, ultimately, deep knowledge and experience serve as risk mitigation in the face of evolving technology.\n\n\n\n\nEven in a future where software development can be completely automated with a prompt from someone with no technical knowledge, programming is an excellent exercise in a specific kind of thinking. In learning to solve problems computationally, we develop new ways of seeing. With this new set of eyes come new ways to make positive change in the world. This applies to both the physical world we inhabit (notice how many daily inconveniences might be solved by a simple program) and the digital ones (notice how software could be made better).\nNo matter how good the machines get, their adoption is guaranteed to be a long and messy process. Success in navigating this ever-shifting landscape will depend on your ability to adapt to new technology, and robust computational thinking skills will make that process much easier.\nWhat is computational thinking and how can you develop it?\nComputational thinking (sometimes called algorithmic thinking) is a name for the cognitive skills we build when we program. It involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts, identifying patterns, and designing step-by-step solutions that can be implemented with code and algorithms.\nEven introductory programming courses naturally develop basic computational thinking. By writing programs to automate tasks, analyze data, or solve challenges, students learn to think in structured, algorithmic ways.\nIf you want to level-up your computational thinking beyond the basics and prepare for the challenges and opportunities of this new era, consider exploring courses that focus on algorithms and data structures. While they seem less practical than courses about specific tools and frameworks, the thinking tools these courses develop will last decades longer than any library or framework which is currently in vogue. \nOur educational research team is also using our open-source plugin to build Cognifire, a low-code learning environment to help students develop their computational thinking. Keep an eye on our newsletter for more information about that in the coming months!\nWe offer free algorithms and data structures courses you can complete in your IDE.\n\n\n\nIf you’re at the beginning of your learning journey, just remember that the challenges and frustrations you encounter when you’re programming are productive in the context of developing these intangible skills and intuitions you’ll need to master programming. Always keep in mind that developing this skill requires practice, reflection, and an openness to facing difficult problems that stretch your mental models.\nHow will careers in programming evolve with AI?\nThe general consensus is that developers will increasingly validate, debug, and communicate about AI-generated code. This will require a deep foundational knowledge, since it’s hard to efficiently debug code you couldn’t have written yourself.\nAt the moment, AI models struggle with broad-scope problems like identifying how changes in one part of a large codebase might affect other interconnected parts. They perform poorly with niche frameworks and tools, lack consistent creativity and deep domain expertise, and only really work if the prompter has given clear and detailed instructions, which is a skill in itself.\n\n\n\n\nWith time, it’s true that many of these shortcomings will improve, but which and how much is hard to say. If there is one thing we do know, it’s that automation is not new to programming, and AI is just another form of it. The job of “programmer” has evolved from doing complicated math by hand to punching machine code into cards, to writing assembly languages, then high-level languages – not to mention adapting to new IDEs and general tools like Git. Learning from history, we see that the tools always change, but the opportunities for people with technical knowledge and high-level reasoning skills continue to flourish. \nLooking into the future, we can expect the same dynamic: the robots are best used for repetitive, predictable work, and everything else will be handled by people. Put concretely, gone are the days of abundant programming jobs with relatively simple, repetitive, and mundane responsibilities.\nSo, does that mean junior developers will be more easily replaced by AI?\nWhile it’s true that roles and duties may change faster for inexperienced programmers than for others, that is because more (but not all) of their responsibilities involve wrestling with the boilerplate code that AI can generate most reliably. This doesn’t mean juniors are going to be replaced by AI – it just means they might spend slightly less time writing code, and more time thinking about it.\nExplore our course catalog\n                                                    \nThis is the first post in our series How to Learn to Program in an AI World, keep an eye out for the next ones on our blog in the coming months.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring Framework 6.2 introduced MockMvcTester to support writing AssertJ style assertions using AssertJ under the hood.\nIf you’re using Spring Boot, the spring-boot-starter-test dependency transitively adds the most commonly used testing libraries such as mockito, assertj, json-path, jsonassert, etc. So, if you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 (which uses Spring framework 6.2) or any later version, you don’t need to add any extra dependencies to use MockMvcTester.\nIn this article, we’ll explore how you can use MockMvcTester for different testing scenarios.\nGetting started with MockMvcTester\nMockMvcTester is built on top of MockMvc and provides AssertJ support for writing tests and asserting the result.\nYou can find the sample application code here.\nHere is an example test written using MockMvc:\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.get;\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status;\n\nclass UserRestControllerTests {\n   @Autowired\n   MockMvc mockMvc;\n\n   @Test\n   void getUserByIdSuccessful() throws Exception {\n       mockMvc.perform(get(\"/api/users/1\")).andExpect(status().isOk());\n   }\n}\nThe same test written using the MockMvcTester fluent API:\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.assertj.MockMvcTester;\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\nclass UserRestControllerTests {\n   @Autowired\n   MockMvcTester mockMvcTester;\n\n   @Test\n   void getUserByIdSuccessful() {\n      assertThat(mockMvcTester.get().uri(\"/api/users/1\")).hasStatusOk();\n   }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt is much easier to use the MockMvcTester fluent API rather than using the IDE feature to find the static imports for get(), post(), status(), etc.\nHow to configure MockMvcTester?\nIf you’re writing a slice test for a controller using @WebMvcTest, you can simply inject MockMvcTester.\nThe @WebMvcTest annotation is meta-annotated with @AutoConfigureMockMvc, so a MockMvc instance is auto-configured. If AssertJ is available, then a MockMvcTester instance will also be auto-configured.\n@WebMvcTest(controllers = UserRestController.class)\nclass UserRestControllerTests {\n   @Autowired\n   MockMvcTester mockMvcTester;\n\n   //...\n}\nIf you’re writing an integration test using @SpringBootTest, then you need to add the @AutoConfigureMockMvc annotation to the test class, and you can also inject MockMvcTester.\n@SpringBootTest\n@AutoConfigureMockMvc\nclass UserRestControllerTests {\n   @Autowired\n   MockMvcTester mockMvcTester;\n\n   //...\n}\nIf you’re already using MockMvc, then you can gradually adopt MockMvcTester by creating a MockMvcTester instance from MockMvc:\nclass UserRestControllerTests {\n   @Autowired\n   MockMvc mockMvc;\n\n   MockMvcTester mockMvcTester;\n\n   @PostConstruct\n   void setUp() {\n       mockMvcTester = MockMvcTester.create(mockMvc);\n   }\n\n   //...\n}\nWriting tests using MockMvcTester\nLet’s explore how we can write tests using MockMvcTester in various scenarios.\nTesting REST API JSON response\nAssume we have a REST API endpoint for user registration that returns HTTP code 201 when successful, along with the response JSON payload with name, email, and role properties.\nWe can write a test using MockMvcTester:\nimport org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;\nimport org.springframework.http.MediaType;\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.assertj.MockMvcTester;\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.assertj.MvcTestResult;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\n@Test\nvoid userRegistrationSuccessful() {\n   String requestBody = \"\"\"\n           {\n               \"email\": \"siva@gmail.com\",\n               \"password\": \"secret\",\n               \"name\": \"Siva\"\n           }\n           \"\"\";\n\n   assertThat(mockMvcTester\n       \t.post()\n       \t.uri(\"/api/users\")\n       \t.contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n       \t.content(requestBody))\n        .hasStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)\n        .bodyJson()\n        .isLenientlyEqualTo(\"\"\"\n             {\n               \"name\": \"Siva\",\n               \"email\": \"siva@gmail.com\",\n               \"role\": \"ROLE_USER\"\n             }\n          \"\"\");\n}\nWe have compared the HTTP status code, converted the response body to JSON, and compared it with our expected JSON structure.\nWe can split the code into two parts to execute the request and assert the result:\nMvcTestResult testResult = mockMvcTester\n       .post()\n       .uri(\"/api/users\")\n       .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n       .content(requestBody)\n       .exchange();\n\nassertThat(testResult)\n       .hasStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)\n       .bodyJson()\n       .isLenientlyEqualTo(\"\"\"\n           {\n              \"name\": \"Siva\",\n              \"email\": \"siva@gmail.com\",\n              \"role\": \"ROLE_USER\"\n           }\n         \"\"\");\nSo far, we have compared the response JSON with our expected JSON structure using a multiline string. Instead, we can also store the JSON as a classpath resource and compare them:\nvar expected = new ClassPathResource(\"/user-registration-response.json\", UserRestControllerTests.class);\n\nassertThat(testResult)\n       .hasStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)\n       .bodyJson()\n       .isLenientlyEqualTo(expected);\nIf you need more control over the response body assertions, you can map the response into a Java object and assert it:\npublic record RegistrationResponse(String name, String email, String role) {}\n\nassertThat(testResult)\n       .hasStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)\n       .bodyJson()\n       .convertTo(RegistrationResponse.class)\n       .satisfies(response -> {\n           assertThat(response.name()).isEqualTo(\"Siva\");\n           assertThat(response.email()).isEqualTo(\"siva@gmail.com\");\n           assertThat(response.role()).isEqualTo(\"ROLE_USER\");\n       });\nTesting REST API exception handling scenarios\nIt is common practice to use @RestControllerAdvice to handle exceptions centrally:\nimport org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;\nimport org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ExceptionHandler;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestControllerAdvice;\n\n@RestControllerAdvice\npublic class GlobalExceptionHandler {\n\n   @ExceptionHandler(UserAlreadyExistsException.class)\n   public ResponseEntity<Object> handle(UserAlreadyExistsException e) {\n       var error = e.getMessage();\n       return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST).body(error);\n   }\n\n   // more handler methods\n}\nFor user registration, we check the existence of the given email in the database and throw UserAlreadyExistsException if the email already exists. The GlobalExceptionHandler will handle this exception and return the appropriate response.\nWe can write a test to handle this scenario using MockMvcTester:\n@Test\nvoid shouldFailToRegisterWithExistingEmail() {\n   String requestBody = \"\"\"\n           {\n               \"email\": \"admin@gmail.com\",\n               \"password\": \"secret\",\n               \"name\": \"Administrator\"\n           }\n           \"\"\";\n\n   MvcTestResult testResult = mockMvcTester.post()\n           .uri(\"/api/users\")\n           .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n           .content(requestBody)\n           .exchange();\n\n   assertThat(testResult)\n           .failure()\n           .isInstanceOf(UserAlreadyExistsException.class)\n           .hasMessage(\"User with email admin@gmail.com already exists\");\n}\nWe have asserted that there is a failure with a specific exception type and the expected error message.\nTesting the Thymeleaf view rendering controllers\nWe can write tests for controllers that handle the request and render a view, such as a Thymeleaf view template.\nLet’s say we have a controller with two handler methods:\nimport jakarta.validation.Valid;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;\nimport org.springframework.ui.Model;\nimport org.springframework.validation.BindingResult;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ModelAttribute;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PathVariable;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.servlet.mvc.support.RedirectAttributes;\n\n@Controller\npublic class UserController {\n   private final UserRepository userRepository;\n   public UserController(UserRepository userRepository) {\n       this.userRepository = userRepository;\n   }\n\n   @GetMapping(\"/users/{id}\")\n   public String getUserById(@PathVariable Long id, Model model) {\n       var user = userRepository.findById(id);\n       if (user != null) {\n           model.addAttribute(\"user\", user);\n           return \"user\";\n       }\n       return \"not-found\";\n   }\n\n   @PostMapping(\"/users\")\n   public String createUser(@ModelAttribute(\"user\") @Valid User user,\n                            BindingResult bindingResult,\n                            RedirectAttributes redirectAttributes) {\n       userRepository.create(user);\n       if (bindingResult.hasErrors()) {\n           return \"create-user\";\n       }\n       redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute(\"successMessage\", \"User saved successfully\");\n       return \"redirect:/users\";\n   }\n}\nLet’s write the first test to invoke GET users/{id} and assert the HTTP status code and the model data:\n@Test\nvoid shouldGetUserById() {\n   var result = mockMvcTester.get().uri(\"/users/1\").exchange();\n\n   assertThat(result)\n           .hasStatusOk()\n           .hasViewName(\"user\")\n           .model()\n           \t.containsKeys(\"user\")\n           \t.containsEntry(\"user\", new User(1L, \"Siva\", \"siva@gmail.com\", \"siva\"));\n}\nHere, we assert the expected view name, model attribute name to be user, and the user object data.\nTesting URL redirects and flash attributes\nLet’s write a test to verify the successful scenario of creating a user with valid data:\n@Test\nvoid shouldCreateUserSuccessfully() {\n   var result = mockMvcTester.post().uri(\"/users\")\n           .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\n           .param(\"name\", \"Test User 4\")\n           .param(\"email\", \"testuser4@gmail.com\")\n           .param(\"password\", \"testuser4\")\n           .exchange();\n\n   assertThat(result)\n           .hasStatus(HttpStatus.FOUND)\n           .hasRedirectedUrl(\"/users\")\n           .flash().containsKey(\"successMessage\")\n           .hasEntrySatisfying(\"successMessage\",\n                   value -> assertThat(value).isEqualTo(\"User saved successfully\"));\n}\nWe have submitted the form with valid data and asserted the expected behavior that the user will be redirected to the new URL /users with a successMessage flash attribute.\nTesting model validation errors\nWhen a form is submitted with invalid data, we usually redisplay the form with error messages.\nLet’s see how we can test the form field validation errors:\n@Test\nvoid shouldGetErrorsWhenUserDataIsInvalid() {\n   var result = mockMvcTester.post().uri(\"/users\")\n           .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)\n           .param(\"name\", \"\") // blank -invalid\n           .param(\"email\", \"testuser4gmail.com\") // invalid email format\n           .param(\"password\", \"pwd\") // valid\n           .exchange();\n\n   assertThat(result)\n           .model()\n           .extractingBindingResult(\"user\")\n           .hasErrorsCount(2)\n           .hasFieldErrors(\"name\", \"email\");\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere, we have submitted the form with invalid values for the name and email fields and asserted the expected error details.\nSimilarly, you can assert the expected headers, cookies, multipart requests, etc.\nSummary\nAs you have seen in this article, MockMvcTester helps you to write tests using a fluent API and provides many custom assertions to verify the results more expressively.\nTo learn more about MockMvcTester, you can check out the official documentation here.\nIf you’re using Spring Boot 3.4.0 or a later version, you can start using MockMvcTester to write more expressive tests using a fluent API. If you’re using an older version, then MockMvcTester could be a solid reason to consider upgrading!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Software development moves fast – really fast. It can also involve multiple teams working from different locations around the world. However, while speed and collaboration can be great for developers and businesses, they can also create security challenges. \nWith more entry points and less time to catch potential threats, each commit, build, and deployment is another opportunity for something to go wrong. Whether that’s a security breach, malicious attack, or accidental exposure, the impact can ripple through your chain and burden every application.\nThat’s where CI/CD security comes in. Learn what securing your CI/CD pipeline means for your team, the main risks you need to be aware of, and the practical steps to safeguard your flow.\nWhat is CI/CD security, and why is it important?\nCI/CD security is a set of practices and controls that protects the entire software delivery process. It prioritizes keeping your code safe from the very start, is built in rather than a separate phase, and is integral to DevSecOps.\nYour CI/CD pipeline has access to tons of sensitive information, including codebases, credentials, and production environments. If compromised, attackers could inject malicious code, steal data, or even gain access to your systems (as they did in the SolarWinds attack).\nAside from these catastrophic breaches, proper CI/CD security helps prevent mistakes, which could expose sensitive data or introduce vulnerabilities. Malicious employee or contractor behavior shouldn’t be overlooked here, either – 20% of businesses cited this as a cause of their data breaches. CI/CD security is both a shield and a safety net in one.\n\n\n\n\nWith development automation, changes can go from a laptop to production in minutes, and CI/CD security needs to ensure it doesn’t slow down the process. Acceleration is great for business agility, but giving attackers a fast track to your systems is hazardous. In fact, less than 10% of companies in 2022 had implemented hack monitoring in their software development lifecycle. \nHowever, get CI/CD security right, and you can have both speed and reliability.\nCI/CD pipeline security threats\nYour CI/CD pipeline has several potential weak points, including: \nSource-code repositories: Where your application code and configuration files live, the starting point of your pipeline.\nBuild servers: The systems that compile your code, run tests, and package your applications. They handle sensitive operations and often have elevated privileges.\nArtifact storage: Where your compiled applications, container images, and packages are stored before deployment. \nDeployment environments: The staging and production systems where your applications run (including cloud platforms and traditional servers).\nThese components face threats from various angles, such as: \nSupply chain attacks: Harmful code can sneak in through compromised third-party tools, libraries, or dependencies used in your application.\nStolen passwords and secrets: Attackers may find exposed credentials in pipeline configurations or scripts. These threats can take a long time to identify and contain – 292 days, according to one report. \nConfiguration mistakes: Small errors in setup can enable attackers to bypass security or gain more access than they should have.\nInsider threats: Developers with pipeline access might accidentally or intentionally introduce vulnerabilities.\nServer breaches: Attackers can get access to the computers that run your build and deployment process.\nThe interconnected nature of CI/CD means that compromising just one part can affect everything in the system.\n\n\n\n\nTips for securing your CI/CD pipeline\nThe most effective CI/CD security involves building multiple layers of protection throughout your pipeline. Rather than implementing a single tool or simply following a checklist, you should set up security checkpoints at every stage.\nEmploy CI/CD access controls\nProtect your pipeline by implementing strict access controls and applying the principle of least privilege. \nUse role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure team members only have the access they absolutely need for their specific roles. To prevent unauthorized code changes, set up mandatory code reviews, enable branch protection rules, and use signed commits.\nRemember to regularly audit these permissions and remove access when team members leave.\nManage secrets effectively\nNever, ever hardcode credentials into your pipeline configurations or code. Instead, use dedicated secrets management tools (such as HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and manage sensitive information.\nRotate these credentials regularly (ideally automatically) and ensure secrets are encrypted both in transit and at rest. It’s also best to use temporary credentials where possible.\nIntegrated security testing\nMake security testing a natural part of your pipeline by putting multiple testing layers in place.\nCertain tools can help you catch vulnerabilities before they reach production:\nStatic Application Security Testing (SAST) analyzes your source code for security vulnerabilities.\nDynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tests running applications.\nInteractive Application Security Testing (IAST) is used for runtime analysis.\nSoftware Composition Analysis (SCA) checks third-party dependencies.\nConfigure these tests to run automatically with each build and block deployments if any security issues are found.\n\n\n\n\nSecure the development and deployment environment\nEnsure your build environments are as secure as your production systems – they’re just as important, if not more. \nHarden your build servers by removing unnecessary services, keeping systems patched, and using minimal base images. Implement network segmentation to isolate build environments from each other and other systems.\nIf you can, consider using temporary infrastructure. This method allows you to create fresh environments for each build and destroy them afterward.\nAutomate security scans\nSet up automated security scanning throughout your pipeline. Use container scanners to check for vulnerabilities in container images, dependency checkers to identify known vulnerabilities in libraries, and registry scanners to ensure the security of stored artifacts. \nEstablish vulnerability thresholds (what level is considered suspicious or a threat) and automatically stop deployments that don’t meet your security standards. Schedule regular scans of your artifacts to ensure you’re aware of new or emerging vulnerabilities.\nMonitor and alert\nImplement comprehensive monitoring for your CI/CD pipeline. Track all activities and watch for unusual patterns like builds at odd hours, unexpected configuration changes, strange resource usage, and deployment events.\nUse detailed logging and set up alerts, making sure your team knows how to respond if something suspicious is found. Security information and event management (SIEM) are great CI/CD security tools – they correlate security events and enable real-time threat detection and response.\nPerform regular security audits and assessments\nRegularly test your CI/CD pipeline security using different methods:\nPenetration testing identifies potential vulnerabilities before attackers do.\nRed team exercises simulate ‘real’ attacks, while blue team exercises let you practice your incident response.\nPurple team exercises are used to improve both your offensive and defensive capabilities.\nCheck your compliance with your local security standards and regulations, and update your controls based on the results of your assessments.\nHow TeamCity can help\nSecurity in your CI/CD pipeline is a must for protecting your software supply chain.

We’ll have live office hours on April 23rd to connect directly with our team. Not part of our Discord community yet? Join the JetBrains Community Discord here to start connecting with fellow WebStorm users and the development team.\nThe JetBrains Community Discord server has been around for a while now, but it’s been challenging for us to use it in a way that truly benefits the community. We’ve seen its potential, but without the right structure and attention, we just haven’t been able to keep up with it.\nWe do want to change that. We’re committed to making the Discord channel a more useful, welcoming place for everyone in the WebStorm community. We believe this space can become an invaluable resource for developers to ask questions, share knowledge, and ultimately grow professionally. In this blog post, we’ll outline how we plan to accomplish this through thoughtful restructuring and active engagement.\nWhat’s Changing: Channel Structure That Makes Sense\nPreviously, we had a single WebStorm channel that served all purposes – from announcements to help requests to general discussions. This made it difficult for our team to stay on top of conversations and for community members to find relevant information.\nTo address this, we’re creating a more structured approach with different channels catering to the various needs of our community:\n#webstorm-announcements\nThis is going to be read-only and will be used by our team to make general announcements about releases, roadmaps, and upcoming events.\n#webstorm-general\nSometimes it can be nice to have a more unstructured format, fostering organic conversation and exchange within the community. That’s exactly what #webstorm-general is going to be for.\n#webstorm-help-hub\nWe will utilize a forum channel, which is easier for everyone who actively seeks help. This is going to be the place to go if you have a feature request, run into a bug, or are unsure how to proceed. \n#webstorm-ama\nSometimes you might have questions that are not necessarily a bug or a feature request, but we do want to provide any kind of transparency we can. So, in case you have any questions, feel free to ask them here. \nLive Events: Direct Access to the People Who Built It\nTalk is cheap. We’re putting our time where our Discord is with an upcoming event:\nLive Office Hours – April 23rd\nTogether with the WebStorm dev team, we want to have a more open dialogue with you. For that very purpose, we are doing live office hours in Discord in #webstorm-office-hours. This will be a great place for you to directly interact with our team and ask any questions you might have. The office hours will be on April 23rd at 4:00 pm CEST/10:00 am EDT, where we will also show some of the new features of the 2025.1 release.\nWhy This Actually Matters\nDeveloper tooling is only as good as the knowledge surrounding it. The most powerful features of WebStorm often remain undiscovered, not because they don’t exist, but because knowledge sharing happens in fragmented, disorganized spaces, and discoverability of features can be very hard if you don’t know about their existence.\nA well-structured community isn’t a nice-to-have — it’s the difference between leveraging 20% of WebStorm’s capabilities and unlocking the full power of your IDE. We hope that this can be a meaningful step in that direction!\nJoin Us\nThe WebStorm Discord isn’t just another Slack alternative or a marketing channel. It’s a technical resource built by developers for developers.\nJoin us on Discord.\nThe WebStorm team",

These frustrating problems can disrupt your workflow and consume valuable time. Visual Studio addresses these concerns with a new feature – the Default File Encoding option.\nYou can now specify the encoding Visual Studio should use when saving files. This ensures that files are saved with the correct encoding, minimizing potential issues.\nDevelopers often work on projects across different platforms, each requiring specific file encodings. Incorrectly managed encodings can lead to various issues, from corrupted files to unreadable text. The Default File Encoding feature helps mitigate this issue by allowing you to set a default encoding, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of character display issues or data corruption.\nSetting the default file encoding\nTo configure the default file encoding, navigate to Tools > Options > Environment > Documents. You’ll find an option labeled Save files with the following encoding. If this option is checked, Visual Studio will attempt to save files using the encoding specified in the adjacent combo box. If unchecked, Visual Studio will revert to its default behavior for managing file encodings.\n\nThis feature is useful for maintaining consistency across projects and minimizing encoding-related issues. It’s a straightforward tool that enhances productivity and preserves file integrity.\nHandling encoding conflicts\nIn cases where Visual Studio cannot save a file with the specified encoding, such as attempting to save a file with Unicode characters in ASCII format, a dialog will notify you of the issue. This proactive notification helps prevent data loss or file corruption, allowing you to address problems promptly.\nAs always, we appreciate your continuous feedback, which drives us to make Visual Studio better with each release.

Visual Studio 2022 introduces the capability to adapt your pasted code with Copilot to reduce the time you spend on making tedious changes.\nStreamline manual code modifications with adaptive paste\nWhen you’re copying and pasting code, the process often comes with extra steps. Adjusting parameters, correcting styling, or fixing even the most minor errors can slow down your workflow. These small, repetitive tasks add up and disrupt your focus. Addressing these challenges, Visual Studio introduces a new Copilot-powered capability that adapts pasted code seamlessly, saving you time and effort.\nThis feature intelligently adapts pasted code to your solution’s context, incorporating the new code into your existing project by:\nAligning syntax and styling with the document\nInferring parameter adjustments\nFixing minor errors\nSupporting language translation, human and code-based\nCompleting patterns or filling in blanks\nExample: Implementing interface members\nImagine you’re working with a `Math` class that implements the `IMath` interface. You copy and paste the implementation for the `Ceiling` method into the same file. Adapting the pasted code will adjust the code to implement the missing `Floor` method, completing the interface for you.\n\nHow to use it\nThe adaptive paste springs into action the moment you perform a regular paste using `Ctrl+V`, assuming the pasted code has at least three lines. When the “Tab to adapt” suggestion action appears, you can press the `TAB` key to request a suggestion. You’ll then see a diff that compares the original pasted code with the adjusted version, so you can preview changes before they’re applied.\nTry adaptive paste in Version 17.14 Preview 3\nStarting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 Preview 3, you can try adaptive paste by turning on the option:\nTools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Editor > Enable Adaptive Paste.\nOnce activated, adaptive paste becomes a helpful tool in your workflow. Whether you’re integrating new snippets, fixing small errors, or streamlining patterns, it supports you in coding more efficiently.\nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Knowledge workers today face myriad challenges in managing their digital workflows. Information is often scattered across multiple applications and formats, and finding the right document, message, or piece of information can be both tedious and time-consuming. This fragmentation creates two major problems for businesses: it hinders collaboration and productivity, and it can lead to costly security issues.\nTo address these challenges, we launched Dropbox Dash, a universal search and knowledge management product that combines AI-powered features with in-depth content access control. Designed to help knowledge workers organize their digital lives, Dash allows users to find, organize, share, and secure content across their apps so they can focus on the work that matters most.\nAt its core, Dash is a universal search product powered by many machine learning technologies and supercharged by generative AI. It offers a powerful AI-driven search experience with advanced filtering capabilities that allow users to quickly locate the information they need, regardless of where it’s stored. With granular access controls, Dash also makes sure employees and external partners see only the right content so that sensitive company information isn’t surfaced unintentionally. And with advanced AI features, Dash can summarize, answer questions, surface insights, and generate drafts.\nThroughout our development process, we experimented extensively and explored numerous solutions to build an AI product for businesses. In order to meet the challenges of modern work in data-intensive environments, we ultimately turned to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents. Additionally, we engineered a minimal Python interpreter focused exclusively on essential features required by our AI agents and supported by extensive testing and security reviews to ensure safe code execution.\nIn the following sections, we’ll dive into the specific challenges we faced while building Dash, the innovative solutions we developed to address them, and important lessons that’ll inform our work moving forward.\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019c63112e617513c94_AtlasGrotesk-Medium-Web-vfl38XiTL.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 500;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019711b648fd1ccd24a_AtlasGrotesk-Regular-Web-vflk7bxjs.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 400;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n.xf-content-height {margin: 0;}\r\n#cta { font-family: AtlasGrotesk,sans-serif; font-size: .900rem; text-decoration: none; background: #f7f5f2; line-height: 1.69; box-sizing: border-box;}\r\n#cta-box { padding: 15px 20px 15px 20px; }\r\n#cta-hed {font-weight: 500;}\r\n#cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #1e1919; padding-left:20px;}\r\n#cta a:link, #cta a:visited  {text-decoration: none;}\r\n#cta p { margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; }\r\n\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta {background: #000;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-box {border: 1px solid; border-bottom: 0;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #f7f5f2;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark .button {background: #000;}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n    background-color: #1e1919;\r\n    color:  #f7f5f2;\r\n    height: 2.5rem;\r\n    padding: 10px 5px 10px 20px;\r\n    font-size: 1rem;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    line-height: 1.2;\r\n    transition: all .3s;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button:hover { background-color: #0061ff; }\r\n\r\nimg {vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px 1px 2px 0px;}\r\n\r\n.c17-plain-html {margin-bottom: 50px}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Dropbox Dash: Find anything.

These challenges stem from the inherent complexities of business data environments, which are characterized by diversity, fragmentation, and multiple data modalities.\nUnderstanding and addressing these challenges is crucial for delivering effective AI solutions that meet the sophisticated needs of business users. Before we dive into how we solved ‌these challenges, let’s first take a look at what each of these data environments entails.\nData diversity\nData diversity refers to the wide range of data types that a business handles, including emails, documents, meeting notes, task management data, and more. Each type of data has its own structure and context, and that can complicate AI processing.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-01.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-01.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1080\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"e322a923-08a8-4585-bc83-f2f99496271c:BuildingDfB-01.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-01.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-01.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1080\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"e322a923-08a8-4585-bc83-f2f99496271c:BuildingDfB-01.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nExample of identifying the right data source, which requires domain knowledge and contextual information\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nEffectively managing diverse data types is critical because each type of data has its own structure and context. For Dash to perform well in a business setting, it must seamlessly process and understand all these different data types.\nData fragmentation\nData fragmentation occurs when an organization’s data is spread across multiple applications. This means that relevant information isn’t stored in a single location, but is instead scattered across different tools and services.\nData fragmentation complicates the process of retrieving and synthesizing information. For users, this means context switching between multiple apps to manually search for the information they need, which is time-consuming, tedious, and inefficient. An AI system that can aggregate and make sense of fragmented data would greatly enhance the user experience by providing a unified and accessible information repository.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-02.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-02.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1080\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d532fede-93b2-40e1-a8e8-2d753b43fd51:BuildingDfB-02.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-02.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/updated/BuildingDfB-02.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1080\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d532fede-93b2-40e1-a8e8-2d753b43fd51:BuildingDfB-02.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nExample of information spread across multiple apps, which requires combining fragmented information to construct a complete answer\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nData modalities\nData modalities refer to the different forms or modes in which data exists.

Addressing these challenges is essential to creating a robust and effective AI solution that meets the various needs of knowledge workers in dynamic and data-intensive environments. To pull this off, we implemented and experimented with multiple solutions. That’s where retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI agents come in.\nLeveraging retrieval-augmented generation\nWhen building Dash, we knew that delivering accurate and relevant responses to user queries was paramount. That’s why we turned to RAG, an industry-standard approach for tasks like query responses and summarization. RAG's ability to combine external information retrieval with state-of-the-art generative models makes it the perfect fit for our product, especially in the complex landscape of enterprise data.\nRAG works by first retrieving the most relevant pieces of content from a dataset or knowledge base and then using a large language model (LLM) to generate a response based on that content. This approach ensures that the answers that the AI system provides aren’t only contextually relevant but also up to date, which is crucial in business environments where data is constantly evolving.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-04.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-04.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"640\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"276a85d0-169a-46f7-93e1-10ebfa5fecb5:BuildingDfB-04.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-04.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-04.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"640\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"276a85d0-169a-46f7-93e1-10ebfa5fecb5:BuildingDfB-04.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nChoosing the right retrieval system\nThe retrieval system is the backbone of any RAG pipeline. It determines not just speed but also whether the LLM has the right context to generate meaningful answers—and a misstep here can compromise the entire user experience. Put another way, the retrieval system sets the bounds of what your LLM can “know” at inference time. It also greatly affects latency, which in turn impacts user satisfaction. And, it shapes the perceived quality of the final answer, since retrieval coverage can make or break correctness and completeness.\nThere are many options when it comes to designing a retrieval system. For question-answering systems, the most common one is to have a vector index where chunked data is indexed on their embeddings. Embeddings are simply a low-dimensional semantic representation of the chunk of data. To retrieve from such an index, semantic search is often used.\nAnother choice is to go with a more traditional approach to a search index, where documents are indexed by their lexical features (e.g., words that appear in the title or body). This approach, however, adds extra latency due to the need for on-the-fly chunking and re-ranking of the chunks during serving time.\nThere are many other options that prioritize data freshness, such as by directly interacting with the API for the platform where your data is stored, for example. But there are a few trade-offs to consider for each of these approaches:\nLatency vs. quality: There’s a pervasive assumption that you can’t have both extremely low latency and high-quality results. Why? Because advanced or larger embedding-based semantic searches may take longer due to their complexity—whether that’s a heavier model or additional reranking steps. For example, if you want more than 95% of your requests to reliably complete in under 1–2 seconds, you might have to use smaller embedding models, which can reduce retrieval accuracy. \nData freshness vs. scalability: Many projects need to keep their data fresh—for instance, re-indexing a news site every few minutes. Frequent re-indexing processes can hinder system throughput or spike latency when they’re underway. Alternatively, on-the-fly API calls to third-party data can push latency well above a few seconds. If near-real-time information is crucial (e.g., updating stock quotes), your system might spend more resources on frequent indexing or caching, throttling your ability to scale.\nBudget vs. user experience: High-quality solutions—advanced embeddings, re-ranking steps, and large-chunked indexes—often require additional compute, and more compute means more cost. If the user experience demands near-instant results with best-in-class recall, the resource burn can be significant. And if budgets are constrained, you might be forced to choose a simpler retrieval pipeline that could degrade the overall quality. \nFor Dash use cases, we prioritized reasonable latency but also high-quality and reasonable data freshness, with both periodic data syncs and the implementation of webhooks whenever appropriate. Specifically, we stayed under 1–2 seconds for over 95% of our queries, which allows us some latency budget for the rest of the pipeline so that our users don’t click away because the response time is too long.\nUltimately, we landed on a traditional information retrieval (IR) approach combined with on-the-fly chunking and reranking: \nTraditional IR: We use a lexical-based system, along with smarter rerankers that use embedding features. \nOn-the-fly chunking: Documents are chunked at query time to ensure we’re pulling only the relevant sections.\nReranking: A larger, but still efficient, embedding model then re-sorts those results to place the most relevant chunks at the top.\nIn practice, this yields high-quality results in under 2 seconds for over 95% of our queries, balancing speed and relevance. The combination allows us to keep costs in check while avoiding the pitfalls of purely semantic or purely lexical retrieval.\nQuality is best when measured end-to-end because all the parts of the RAG system need to work together effectively. Once we chose the retrieval system that best fit our needs, it was time to pick the best LLM for the job.\nChoosing the right model\nTo ensure this approach met our requirements, we conducted a rigorous evaluation. We tested multiple retrieval methods and model variations on several public datasets, including Google’s Natural Questions (featuring real user queries with large documents); MuSiQue (with multi-hop questions requiring information linking across different passages); and Microsoft’s Machine Reading Comprehension (containing often short passages and multi-document queries from Bing logs).\nWe also designed hand-tuned metrics to help evaluate the quality of generated answers. These included an LLM judge for answer correctness (passing retrieved evidence through an LLM to score final answer accuracy), an LLM judge for completeness (measuring the extent to which all relevant question aspects are addressed), as well as source precision, recall, and F1 metrics to evaluate how accurately we retrieved key passages needed for correct answers.\nBy cross-referencing these metrics, we could directly compare multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs in a consistent environment. This led us to narrow down a few model families that best suited Dash’s use cases.\nOur RAG system remains model agnostic: We want to provide the flexibility of choosing the models and providers our customers are most comfortable with. Being model agnostic also allows us to be prepared to adapt to rapid developments in the field of LLMs.\nAlthough RAG provides a solution for the most common types of questions—kinds that require fetching information from one or more documents—it’s incapable of performing complex, multi-step tasks. This is where AI agents come in.\nThe role of AI agents\nImagine you’ve asked a colleague to help you with a complex task, such as, “What’s the progress on projects in my team’s Q1 OKRs?” This person would likely find the answer to this question by first breaking it down into individual steps before tackling those steps one at a time.\nTo handle the business challenges outlined above, we need an AI system that can approach complex tasks like humans do. These tasks may require domain knowledge, contextual information, and planning and executing multiple steps—and AI agents are exceptional at doing just that.\nThe term \"AI agent\" is often used loosely across the tech industry, and with various interpretations. However, there’s a common theme among all of them: an AI agent is a system that can autonomously perform tasks with very little to no human interaction.\nAt Dropbox, our interpretation of AI agents is more specific and aligned with the needs of business applications. We view AI agents as multi-step orchestration systems that can dynamically break down user queries into individual steps, execute those steps using available resources and information from the current user, and generate a final response—all while requiring minimal human oversight.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2400\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1256\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"79f53398-3024-4cf7-87a4-69ce3ee639fc:BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/april/building-dash-for-business/diagrams/BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2400\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1256\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"79f53398-3024-4cf7-87a4-69ce3ee639fc:BuildingDfB-1200x628_05.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nAgents as multi-step orchestration\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nThe multi-step orchestration in our AI agents includes two stages: planning and execution.\nStage 1: Planning\nThe planning stage involves breaking down a user's query into a sequence of high-level steps. This is done by an LLM, which interprets the query and generates simple code statements to express the logic of responding to the user’s query. The LLM-generated code is written in our domain-specific language (DSL), which is similar to the Python programming language. The initial plan of responding to the user’s query is restricted to high-level or simple code statements, which ensures clarity and precision in defining each step.\nFor example, let’s explore the request, \"Show me the notes for tomorrow’s all-hands meeting.\" These steps contain the logic necessary to respond to the query:\nResolve concrete dates and times for the phrase “tomorrow.” There needs to be an established time window to identify what “tomorrow” is referring to. This must be done relative to the current date and time.\nIdentify the meeting. There needs to be a search conducted for a meeting with a title matching \"all-hands\" (and within the determined time window).\nRetrieve notes. Documents attached to or linked from the identified meeting must be fetched.\nThe AI agent, however, expresses this logic as statements of code in our Python-like DSL. Below is a simplified version of what that’d look like:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \ntime_window: TimeWindow = time_helper.get_time_window_for_tomorrow()\r\nmeeting: Meeting = meetings_helper.find_meeting(title=\"all-hands\", \r\ntime_window=time_window)\r\nnotes: list[Document] = meetings_helper.get_attached_documents(meeting=meeting)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\nEach XXXX_helper object in the generated code contains functionality that acts as a building block for the LLM to use when expressing the logic of responding to the user’s query.\nStage 2: Execution\nThe next step is to validate and execute the logic that was expressed as code. The code is validated through static analysis to ensure correctness, safety, and to detect missing functionality. We intentionally allow the LLM to assume that missing functionality exists. If missing functionality is identified, we use the LLM a second time to implement the missing code.\nThis two-stage approach to generating code allows the agents to be clear and focused with an overall plan, while also being adaptable to new types and variations of user queries. Below is a simplified version of what the result of each of the steps might look like:\n1. Time window retrieval: Resolve the relative phrase “tomorrow” to concrete values.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \ntime_window: TimeWindow = time_helper.get_time_window_for_tomorrow()\r\n# TimeWindow(start=\"2025-03-19\", end=\"2025-03-20\")\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\n2. Meeting identification: Search for the \"all-hands\" meeting within the resolved time window.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \nmeeting: Meeting = meetings_helper.find_meeting(title=\"all-hands\", \r\ntime_window=time_window)\r\n# Meeting(title=\"Company All-Hands\", start_time=..., attendees=...)\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\n3. Document retrieval: Finally, fetch the notes attached to the identified meeting.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        Copy\r\n    \r\n    \nnotes: list[Document] = meetings_helper.get_attached_documents(meeting=meeting)\r\n# [Document(title=\"All-Hands-Notes\", content=\"...\")]\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\n\nThe final response to the user’s query is the result of the last step. In this example, the list of documents will be returned to the user.\nValidation and testing\nThe interpreter we use to execute the LLM-generated code was developed from scratch here at Dropbox. This gave us full control over everything inside the interpreter, including integrating static analysis passes and “dry runs,” in addition to having run-time type enforcement.\nStatic analysis allows our interpreter to examine the code without executing it, helping us automatically identify potential security risks, missing functionality, or code correctness errors. Having run-time type enforcement helps ensure that the data and objects being operated on are the types of values that we expect. In our example, the list of documents returned to the user will always be a list of documents.\nNormally, testing LLM integrations can be an ever-moving target. As new model versions are released, slight changes in how things are phrased or reacted to can be expected. Knowing exactly why a test failed or why the final response differed from expectations is often challenging.\nHowever, as a result of the LLM using code to express its logic in responding to the user, we’re able to make the LLM “show the work.” This helps with understanding at which step the logic failed, having more deterministic testing, and evaluating the response to a query. For example:\nLogic failure: “Can’t answer this question” vs. “Error on step 3 when fetching attached documents to meeting…”\nMore deterministic testing: Does resolving “tomorrow” always return the correct time window?\nEvaluating responses: “Does the response text have the approximate same meaning as what we expected?” vs. “Does the response value match the expected type list[Document]?”\nSecurity and efficiency\nTo address security concerns, we implemented security controls in our interpreter and its development process. Only the minimal required functionality is implemented in its runtime—feature parity with CPython isn’t the goal. This turns major security risks that exist in other full-featured interpreters into non-issues.\nAs we’ve explored, AI agents play a pivotal role in addressing the complexities of business tasks through their ability to plan and execute multi-step workflows autonomously. By leveraging LLMs and DSLs, these agents break down intricate queries into actionable steps, ensuring precision and efficiency. The structured approach, combined with strong typing and built-in security controls, enhances reliability and mitigates security risks.\nThe future of AI agents in business environments is promising. And as we continue to refine and expand their capabilities, they’ll become indispensable in streamlining operations, enhancing productivity, and driving innovation.\nLessons learned and future direction\nThroughout our journey in developing business-ready AI solutions, we’ve learned several valuable lessons that have shaped our approach and informed our decisions. While AI agents excel at handling complex tasks through multi-step orchestration, RAG remains indispensable for simpler information retrieval tasks. The key is determining the appropriate tool for each scenario.\nOur development of business AI solutions has forced us to adapt our approach to address data diversity, fragmentation, and modalities. We’ve had to innovate to make our solutions robust and scalable. We‘ve also observed that not all LLMs are equal: the same prompts can’t be used for different LLMs. This variability necessitates careful selection and optimization of prompts for LLMs to complete specific tasks.\nMoreover, the trade-offs between model size, latency, and accuracy are real. While larger models may provide more precise results, they can introduce delays that may not align with user expectations. Understanding these trade-offs is crucial for delivering a good user experience.\nLooking ahead, we’re excited to explore several promising directions that’ll further enhance our AI capabilities and drive innovation in knowledge management. Enabling AI agents to engage in multi-turn conversations will allow for more natural and intuitive interactions, mimicking human-like dialogue and improving the overall user experience. And developing self-reflective agents that can evaluate their own performance and adapt to new information will increase their autonomy and effectiveness, reducing the need for human intervention.\nIn addition, continuous fine-tuning of LLMs to align with specific business needs will enhance their relevance and accuracy, ensuring they meet the high standards of business environments. And lastly, expanding AI capabilities to support multiple languages will make our products more accessible and valuable to a global user base, fostering collaboration and productivity across diverse teams.\nThe integration of RAG and AI agents has significantly enhanced Dropbox Dash with AI capabilities to bring useful answers to users’ questions, and we’re focused on addressing challenges and exploring opportunities based on what we’ve learned. We’re also committed to our AI principles and being worthy of trust. By consistently innovating and refining our approach, we aim to develop products that meet the current needs of businesses and help move the future of knowledge work forward. \nThe landscape of business AI is evolving rapidly, and we’re excited about advancing AI capabilities to empower users to focus on truly meaningful, human work.",

특히 기존의 DALL-E에서는 한글이 제대로 나오지 않아서 포토샵이나 별도 디자인 툴을 써야 했던 불편함이 있었잖아요. 저도 처음에 유튜브 시작했을 때 썸네일 만드는 데만 몇 시간씩 쏟아부었던 기억이 나네요.  </p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><b>GPT 4o로 바뀐 썸네일 생성, 뭐가 달라졌을까?

(당연히 저도 무료 그 이상의 가치가 있는 챗봇이라면 유료화를 검토중입니다.)\n반응형\n\n    \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n  \n\n \nChatGPT - 챗GPT 유튜브 썸네일 생성기\n사용자의 키워드로 클릭을 유도하는 16:9 비율의 유튜브 썸네일을 생성합니다.\nchatgpt.com\n\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"이 GPTS는 무료인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"ChatGPT Plus 구독자라면 별도 비용 없이 사용 가능합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"한 번에 몇 개의 썸네일을 생성할 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"한 번에 하나씩 생성 가능하며, 수정 요청을 통해 개선할 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"생성된 이미지의 저작권은 어떻게 되나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"OpenAI의 정책에 따라 생성된 이미지는 사용자가 저작권을 가집니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"텍스트가 깨지면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"\\\"텍스트를 더 크게\\\" 또는 \\\"텍스트를 선명하게\\\" 등으로 수정 요청을 해보세요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"특정 브랜드 로고를 넣을 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"저작권 문제로 인해 정확한 브랜드 로고 생성은 제한될 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Rumi라는 회사에서 GPT-o3와 GPT-o4 mini 같은 최신 ChatGPT 모델이 사용자 모르게 텍스트에 워터마크를 숨겨놓는다는 걸 발견했대요. 헐, 내가 쓴 글도...? 바로 확인해봤죠. 그랬더니 정말로 있는 거 아니겠어요? 눈에는 안 보이지만 특수 문자로 몰래 표시를 해둔 거였어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">솔직히 말해서 좀 배신감이 들었어요. 내가 냈던 리포트에도 이런 게 있었다면? 교수님이 발견했다면? 생각만 해도 끔찍하더라구요. 그래서 직접 이런 워터마크를 감지하고 제거할 수 있는 도구를 만들어보기로 했습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>도대체 이게 뭔가요?

Rumi라는 회사에서 GPT-o3와 GPT-o4 mini 같은 최신 ChatGPT 모델이 사용자 모르게 텍스트에 워터마크를 숨겨놓는다는 걸 발견했대요. 헐, 내가 쓴 글도...? 바로 확인해봤죠. 그랬더니 정말로 있는 거 아니겠어요? 눈에는 안 보이지만 특수 문자로 몰래 표시를 해둔 거였어요.\n \n솔직히 말해서 좀 배신감이 들었어요. 내가 냈던 리포트에도 이런 게 있었다면? 교수님이 발견했다면? 생각만 해도 끔찍하더라구요. 그래서 직접 이런 워터마크를 감지하고 제거할 수 있는 도구를 만들어보기로 했습니다.\n \n도대체 이게 뭔가요? AI의 숨겨진 워터마크  \n일단 이 워터마크가 뭔지부터 알아봤어요. 기사에 따르면 이 워터마크는 주로 긴 응답에서 발견되며, 일반 공백처럼 보이지만 다른 ASCII 코드를 가진 특수 유니코드 문자(주로 Narrow No-Break Space)를 사용한다고 해요.\n제가 알아본 바로는 이 워터마크는 주로:\n제로 너비 문자 - 눈에 보이지 않는 공백이나 제어 문자\n특수 공백 - 일반 공백처럼 보이지만 다른 ASCII 코드를 가진 유니코드 문자\n이모지 변형 선택자 - 이모지 뒤에 붙어 변형을 주는 특수 문자\n이런 것들로 구성되어 있더라구요.\n사실 OpenAI는 공식적으로 \"워터마크가 아니라 대규모 강화학습의 특이점\"이라고 변명(?)했지만... 글쎄요, 그게 그거 아닌가요?  \n \n제가 직접 만든 워터마크 감지/제거 도구 ⚒️\n저는 프론트엔드 개발자니까, 바로 웹 기반 도구를 만들기로 했어요.

SEO에 최적화된 글, 클릭을 유도하는 글, 전환율을 높이는 글... 이런 것들이 제 진짜 목소리를 밀어냈던 거예요.\n \n날카로운 질문은 피하고, 강한 표현만 빌려쓰는 모순  \n또 하나 깨달은 건, 제가 GPT에게 종종 \"센 표현\", \"날카로운 비판\"을 요구하면서도, 정작 저 자신은 그런 날카로움을 피하고 있다는 거예요. 예를 들어, 누군가 제 글이나 생각에 대해 도전적인 질문을 하면 \"아, 이건 콘텐츠 소재로 삼기 좋겠네요\"라고 빠져나가는 패턴이 있더라고요.\n\"GPT가 나를 대신해 말하게 한 표현 중, '사실은 내가 하고 싶었던 말'은 얼마나 될까?\"\n\n\n \n그러고 보니 GPT에게 '독설'을 부탁하거나 '강한 어조'로 뭔가를 작성해달라고 한 적이 많았어요. 그건 어쩌면 제가 직접 말하기 두려운 것들, 제가 느끼지만 인정하기 싫은 감정들이었던 건 아닐까요?\n \n통제 욕구의 아이러니: GPT에게 맡기면서도 끊임없이 수정하기  \n참 모순적인 게, GPT한테 글을 맡기면서도 끊임없이 수정하고 제어하려는 제 모습이 있어요. \"이렇게 해줘, 저렇게 바꿔줘\"를 반복하면서, 결국은 제가 원하는 방향으로만 끌고 가려고 하죠.\n \n\"GPT에게 모든 걸 맡기면서도, 그 결과물에 대해 끊임없이 수정과 통제를 하려 드는 나는 도대체 어떤 권력을 추구하고 있는 걸까?\"\n\n\n \n아마도 저는 '창작자'로서의 정체성은 지키고 싶으면서, 동시에 창작의 수고로움은 피하고 싶은 모순적인 욕구를 가진 것 같아요. 마치 어딘가에 숨어서 꼭두각시를 조종하는 인형사처럼요.\n \n자기 방어의 수단으로서의 GPT 사용  ️\n가끔은 제가 GPT를 일종의 방패처럼 사용하고 있다는 생각도 들어요. \"이건 AI가 만든 콘텐츠예요\"라고 말함으로써, 비판으로부터 자신을 보호하는 거죠. 이건 일종의 정서적 안전장치같은 역할을 하는 것 같아요.\n\"나는 왜 누군가 나를 조롱하는 상상, 비난하는 상상을 이렇게 자주 하나? 내가 먼저 날 공격해야 남들이 덜 아프게 때릴 거라 믿는 건 아닐까?\"\n \n이 패턴은 GPT를 넘어 제 인생 전반에 퍼져있는 것 같아요. 누군가 제 작업을 비판하기 전에 스스로 약점을 지적해두는 습관, 완벽하지 않으면 아예 시도조차 하지 않는 경향... 그리고 이제는 GPT라는 완벽한 방패가 생긴 거죠.\n \n진짜 '나'는 어디에 있는 걸까?  \n가장 무서운 질문은 이거예요:\n \n\"내가 지금까지 만든 콘텐츠 중, GPT 없이 스스로 쓴 문장에 정말 '나'가 담겼던 건 얼마나 될까?\"\n\n\n \n솔직히 계산하기 두려워요. 일의 효율성을 높이고, SEO 최적화도 잘 되고, 클라이언트도 만족시키는 콘텐츠를 만들어왔지만... 그 안에 진짜 저의 목소리, 저의 생각, 저의 감정은 얼마나 있었을까요? 어쩌면 GPT 없이는 더 이상 글을 쓸 수 없는 사람이 되어버린 건 아닐까 하는 두려움도 있어요.\n \n\n\n \n하지만 역설적으로, 지금 이 글을 쓰면서 GPT와의 관계를 돌아보는 과정에서 오히려 더 진솔한 제 목소리를 찾고 있는 것 같기도 해요. 때로는 거울이 필요하듯, AI라는 거울을 통해 제 모습을 더 선명하게 볼 수 있게 된 건지도 모르겠네요.\n \n여러분은 어떠신가요? AI를 사용하면서 발견한 자신의 모순적인 모습, 혹은 새롭게 깨달은 자아의 일부가 있나요? 댓글로 공유해주시면 좋겠어요. 어쩌면 우리는 AI와 대화하는 동안, 진짜로는 스스로와 대화하고 있는 건지도 모르니까요.\nFAQ 섹션\nQ: GPT 사용이 창의성을 감소시키나요?\nA: 사용 방식에 따라 달라요. 도구로만 활용하면 창의성이 줄지만, 협업 파트너로 활용하면 오히려 새로운 아이디어 발상에 도움될 수 있어요.\nQ: AI 의존도가 높아지는 것을 어떻게 방지할 수 있을까요?\nA: 의식적으로 AI 없이 글쓰기 연습하는 시간을 정기적으로 가지고, AI는 편집이나 발전 단계에서만 활용하는 방식이 효과적이에요.\nQ: GPT를 사용하면서 발생하는 정서적 영향이 있나요?\nA: 편리함과 효율성 뒤에 창작 불안, 진정성 결여 같은 감정적 부작용이 숨어있을 수 있어요.\nQ: GPT에게 감정표현을 요구하는 것의 심리적 의미는 무엇인가요?\nA: 종종 우리가 표현하기 어려운 감정을 대리 표현하게 하거나, 디지털 환경에서 점점 무뎌지는 우리 감정을 보완하려는 시도일 수 있어요.\nQ: AI와의 건강한 창작 관계는 어떤 모습일까요?\nA: 자신의 목소리와 비전은 유지하면서 AI를 도구이자 협력자로 활용하고, 정기적으로 의존도를 점검하는 관계가 이상적이에요.\n \n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT 사용이 창의성을 감소시키나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"사용 방식에 따라 달라요. 도구로만 활용하면 창의성이 줄지만, 협업 파트너로 활용하면 오히려 새로운 아이디어 발상에 도움될 수 있어요.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"AI 의존도가 높아지는 것을 어떻게 방지할 수 있을까요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"의식적으로 AI 없이 글쓰기 연습하는 시간을 정기적으로 가지고, AI는 편집이나 발전 단계에서만 활용하는 방식이 효과적이에요.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT를 사용하면서 발생하는 정서적 영향이 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"편리함과 효율성 뒤에 창작 불안, 진정성 결여 같은 감정적 부작용이 숨어있을 수 있어요.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT에게 감정표현을 요구하는 것의 심리적 의미는 무엇인가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"종종 우리가 표현하기 어려운 감정을 대리 표현하게 하거나, 디지털 환경에서 점점 무뎌지는 우리 감정을 보완하려는 시도일 수 있어요.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"AI와의 건강한 창작 관계는 어떤 모습일까요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"자신의 목소리와 비전은 유지하면서 AI를 도구이자 협력자로 활용하고, 정기적으로 의존도를 점검하는 관계가 이상적이에요.\"\n    }\n  }]\n}",

기간을 버팀으로서 말이죠</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">100년쯤의 과정중에 미국이 한번만 더 금융위기 같은 사태를 맞으면<br />중국이 더 빨리 역전할 수 있을 것입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">인간의 탐욕을 본다면 이런일은 10년에 한번즘은 충분히 일어날 것입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\">과거의 나</h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 그전까진 K-베터리 추종자였지만 지금은 아닙니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">트럼프는 관세의 악영향으로 더이상 추친을 못하고 후퇴했습니다.<br />이제 장난으로라도 다시 진행하려고하면 어마어마한 시장 충격을 감당해야하고<br />본인도 미국의 성장을 신경쓰는 것으로 보입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">처음엔 미란 보고서 처럼 미국 피흘리면서 중국을 친다는걸로 알았으나<br />국채 터지니까 바로 방향바꾸는거 보고 아니라는걸 알았습니다.</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\">중국의 현재 상황</h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">유튜브에 중국영상을 보면 서민들은 사업이 다망하고 집값이 엉망이 되어 집산사람도 망하고<br />일거리를 못찾아 우는 졸업자들 영상을 많이 볼 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이걸보고 \"이러다 망하겠네\" 라고 생각하는건 1차원적인 생각입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그 덕분에 인건비가 나락으로가서 글로벌 경쟁력이 생겼습니다.<br />중공 체재를 유지하기위해서는 부자가 많은것 보다 가난한 사람이 많은게 통제하기 쉬웠던 것입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"살려만 드릴께\" 를 시전하면 인민들은 말을 들을 수 밖에 없겠죠<br />혁명의 역사를 보면 알겠지만 혁명한다고 바로 좋아지지 않습니다.<br />혼돈의 시기 3년~10년 정도를 살아남아야하는데</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">재력이 충분하지 않은 서민들은 그것도 쉽지 않습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">프랑스 형명 당시에는 빵값을 제어하지 못해 혁명을 했음에도 경제는 파탄이 났었고<br />외부에서 약해진 프랑스를 공격하려는 부분도 막아야해서 서민의 생존은 거의 확율 싸움이였습니다.<br />(대량의 목슴을 갈아넣고 운이 좋은 사람은 살아남는 수준)</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">마윈때 보시면 알겠지만 점점 부자가되기 시작하니까 자신들의 목소리를 내기 시작합니다.<br />이러면 중국이 민주화가 되는 길이니 <br />중공은 이것을 당연히 막아야했던 것이죠</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\">정신

data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 이벤트를 통해 저는 부동산을 띄우려는 공무원 세력이 있다는것을 눈치 챘습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">정치인 그룹의 목표는 의원내각제를 실행하는 것입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">대통령을 없애고 정치인들 끼리 짬짜미 해서 총리를 뽑겠다는 30년

투표수를 늘리는 작업을 20년에 걸처 해야 했습니다.<br />결국 그들은 목표를 이뤘지만 한국에는 한국 사람이 줄게 되었죠</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">애국에 대한 힘을 줄여야하니 당연히 k-베터리 같은걸 부양해서도 안되고 부양하고 싶지도 않았던 것입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\">K-베터리의 미래</h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 어중간한 상황에 k-베터리 살아나는 시나리오는 생각하기 어렵습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">바닥까지 갔다 방향전환하는게 맞습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그 바닥을 알리는 신호로서 중국의 부흥이 필요합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">중국의 첨단기술의 경쟁력이 미국을 앞지르고<br />사람들이 경악해서 대체 수단을 찾는 과정에서 k-베터리가 뜨는 것이죠</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"이대로 가면 중국이 다 먹는게 확실하다\" 라는 공포</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">지구 온난화 문제가 2000년도 부터 있었죠 25년이나 지난 지금도 온난화는 있지만 사람들은 공포를 느끼지 못하고 있습니다. 불편함 때문에 전기차를 타지 않는 다는 것이 그것입니다.</p>\n<p

Fanatics 대표가 하루 종일 대가리를 땅에 처박고 사람들의 신발만 봤던 그 자세로 스토커같이 집착해야 한다.\n우리 회사 임직원들은 우리가 만드는 제품에 대해서 이렇게 하루 종일 생각하는가? 우리 고객이 뭘 원하는지 알아내기 위해서 스토커와 같은 마인드로 집착하고 있나? 날이 갈수록 경쟁이 심화되고, 기울어진 운동장의 경사는 더 가팔라지는데, 스토커와 같은 마인드로 우리 제품, 고객, 직원, 성공에 집착하지 않으면 매번 지는 경기를 할 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "2주 전 열렸던 2025년도 마스터스 골프 대회를 드디어 로리 맥길로이가 우승했다. 맥길로이가 2009년도를 시작으로 그동안 17번이나 마스터스에 참가했는데, 탑텐은 여러 번 했고 준우승도 한 번 했지만, 우승은 이번이 처음이었다. 16년 만에 거머쥔 우승 트로피였고, 그 누구보다 우승을 간절히 원했던 선수였기 때문에, 이번 우승은 나에게도 굉장히 감동적으로 다가왔다.\n우승 인터뷰에서 맥길로이가 이런 말을 했다. “과연 내가 이 대회를 우승할 수 있을지 의문하기 시작했다.(I started to wonder if my time would ever come)”. 그가 울먹이면서 이 말을 하는 그 순간, 바로 우리가 투자한 창업가들의 모습이 그대로 떠올랐다.\n맥길로이가 마스터스 대회에 첫 출전 했을 때의 나이가 18살이었다. 엄청난 거물 신인이었고, 그의 기세와 실력은 마스터스 대회를 한 10번은 우승할 수 있을 것 같았다. 첫 출전부터 우승을 노렸지만, 우승하지 못했을 때 그의 심정은, “첫 출전이니까 괜찮아. 나는 젊고 앞으로 기회는 너무 많아. 내년엔 우승해야지.” 정도이지 않았을까 생각한다. 그런데 그다음 해에도 우승에 실패했다. 이번에도 “괜찮아. 난 아직 10대야. 내년에 이기면 돼.”라고, 생각했을 것이다. 하지만, 3년 차도 우승하지 못했고, 그다음에도 못 했고, 수년 동안 계속 우승에 실패했다. 어떤 해엔 우승에 가까이 갔지만, 반면에 형편없는 성적으로 마친 적도 많다. 그러면서 맥길로이도 20대가 됐고, 다시 30대가 됐다. 체력도 예전 같지가 않고, 민첩성과 시력도 떨어지면서 더 이상 “내년에 우승하면 돼.”라는 자신감보단, “내가 과연 우승할 수 있을까?”라는 의구심이 마음을 지배하기 시작했다.\n나는 맥길로이는 개인적으로 모르지만, 그가 지난 17년 동안 마스터스 대회에 대해서 느꼈던 이 감정의 변화는 아주 정확하게 이해한다. 나도 스트롱을 운영하면서 비슷한 과정을 겪었고, 지금 이 순간에도 우리가 투자한 창업가들이 맥길로이가 거친 과정을 그대로 경험하고 있기 때문이다.\n먼저, 스트롱 이야기를 해보자. 2012년도에 우린 1호 펀드를 만들었고, 2015년도에 2호 펀드를 만들었다. VC를 처음 시작할 땐, TechCrunch나 WSJ에서 읽는 것처럼, 우리도 좋은 회사에 투자해서 50배, 100배의 수익을 만들 수 있다는 자신감과 순진한 희망으로 가득 차 있었다. 투자를 시작하고, 첫 2년이 지났을 땐 “이 회사들은 아직 시간이 걸려. 조금만 더 지나면 엑싯이 한두 개는 나올 거야.”라는 희망과 자신감이 아직 충만했다. 그런데 3년, 그리고 4년이 지나면서 이 희망이 서서히 의구심으로 바뀌기 시작했다. 유니콘이 될 거로 생각했던 투자사들이 점점 더 싹수가 노래 보이면서, 과연 이 중 엑싯이 하나라도 나올지 스스로에게 의문하기 시작했다. 그리고 이 의구심은 시간이 갈수록 점점 더 조바심과 절망감으로 매우 빠르게 바뀌면서 “나는 과연 투자해서 돈을 벌 수 있을까? 나에게도 엑싯이라는게 생길까?”를 의문하기 시작했다. 하지만, 내가 하는 투자가 맞다면 언젠가는 좋은 결실을 볼 것이라는 믿음을 억지로라도 스스로에게 주입하면서 계속 버텼고, 2017년도에 우리가 가장 먼저 투자했던 코빗이 좋은 엑싯을 했다. 이를 계기로 그동안 쌓인 의구심이 다시 자신감과 희망으로 바뀌었고, 이후 우린 계속 좋은 투자를 할 수 있게 됐다. 하지만, 이 과정에서 나는 맥길로이가 겪었던 그 똑같은 희망 -> 의심 -> 절망, 변화의 과정을 거쳤고, 이게 정확히 어떤 감정인지 잘 이해하고 있다.\n우리가 투자한 창업가들도 모두 다 이런 과정을 경험한다. 아마도 대부분 5년 정도 사업하면 좋은 엑싯을 하거나, 회사가 괄목할 만한 성장을 할 것이라는 희망을 품고 창업했을 것이다. 하지만, 사업이라는 게 생각보다 어렵다. 첫 1년은 개고생인데, 이때만 해도 체력도 있고, 희망도 있고, 자신감도 있어서 “한 2년만 더 하면 잘할 수 있을 거야”라는 생각으로 더 열심히 한다. 제품도 열심히 만들고, 펀딩도 열심히 하고, 좋은 사람도 열심히 채용한다. 하지만, 잘 안된다. 제품을 아무리 잘 만들어도 고객은 안 생기고, 수많은 투자자를 만나지만 그 누구도 돈은 안 주고, 아무도 우리 회사에 오려고 하지 않는다. 그래도 계속 희망과 자신감으로 몇 년을 더 버틴다. 딱 일 년만 더 하면 모든 게 잘될 거라는 생각으로. 이 과정을 거치면서 10년이라는 세월이 흐른다. 회사는 안 망했지만, 창업 초기에 꿈꿨던 성장은 아직도 너무 멀리 있고, 이 10년 동안 창업가의 희망은 의구심으로 바뀌면서 “과연 내가 이 사업을 성공시킬 수 있을까?”라는 질문을 스스로에게 매일 하게 된다. 이게 요새 내가 거의 매일 경험하는 상황이다.\n맥길로이가 걸어온 길과 그 감정의 변화를 나는 잘 알기 때문에, 내가 그를 그렇게 좋아하진 않지만, 그의 이번 마스터스 우승은 감동 그 자체였다. 그는 또, “꿈이 있으면 절대로 포기하지 마라. 다시 일어나서 도전해라. 계속 열심히 노력해라. 그러면 꿈을 이룩할 수 있을 것이다.”라는 이야기를 했다. 실은, 이 말은 누구나 다 할 수 있는 너무 뻔한 말이긴 하지만, 이 말을 하는 대부분의 사람은 이 말을 할 자격이 없지만, 맥길로이는 이 말을 할 수 있는 자격을 스스로 얻었다고 생각한다.\n우리 창업가들이 나에게 자주 물어본다. “대표님, 저도 이 미친 짓 한지가 이제 8년째인데요, 제가 과연 이 사업을 성공시킬 수 있을까요?”\n솔직히, 내가 대답하기에 굉장히 부담스럽고 어려운 질문이라서 나도 항상 생각을 많이 하는데, 그럼에도 내 대답은 항상 “지금까지 안 망했으면 뭔가는 제대로 하고 있다고 생각해요. 계속 도전하고, 계속 열심히 하다 보면 언젠가는 기회가 올 것입니다.”이다.\n그 언젠가가 정말로 언제일진 나도 잘 모르겠지만, 언젠가는 할 수 있다는 믿음조차 없다면 우린 이 험난하고 미친 여정을 계속할 수 없을 것이다.",

CSR의 일환으로 시작한 서비스였군요. 은행이라는 금융권에서 ‘계약’ 서비스에 주목한 것이 신기하게 느껴졌어요.\n대부분 사회공헌 활동을 떠올리면 기부와 봉사활동 같은 자선적인 활동을 떠올리는데요. 저희는 고객들에게 진짜로 필요한 서비스를 제공해 세상의 문제를 해결하는 방식 또한, 꼭 필요하고 의미있는 CSR이 될 수 있을거라 생각했습니다.\n무엇보다 토스뱅크가 특히 일하는 환경에 주목한 이유는 ‘일’이 본격적인 금융생활의 시작점이라 보기 때문입니다. 근로소득은 가장 기본적인 소득원 중 하나고요. 일하면서 버는 돈은 은행 계좌에 보관하고, 투자하고, 소비하는 등 금융 활동과 밀접한 연관을 맺고 있죠. 또한 일하는 과정에서 발생할 수 있는 다양한 문제를 사전에 예방하고, 문제가 생기더라도 원만히 해결할 수 있도록 돕는 장치가 바로 ‘계약’입니다. 앞으로도 토스뱅크는 누구나 쉽게 활용할 수 있는 ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스를 제공하려 해요.\n\nQ. 고객들에게 꼭 필요한 서비스를 제공하는 방식으로 CSR을 한다, 신선한 방향 같아요. 처음 아이디어가 나왔을 때 팀 내부 반응은 어땠나요?\n정말 좋았어요. 토스뱅크 동료들은 금융의 영역이 아닌 곳에서도 새로운 도전을 할 수 있는 사람들인 만큼 팀 내에서 이런 방향성에 대해 공감대가 잘 형성되기도 했고요. 서비스 만들 길드 구성원을 모집할 때에도, 거의 모든 동료들이 자발적으로 지원해주셔서 빠르게 만들어낼 수 있었어요.\n가장 고민됐던 지점은 ‘법률적인 문제가 없을지’였어요. 서비스를 쉽게 제공하면서도 은행에게 허용되는 범위를 지켜야 했거든요. 법무팀에서 꼼꼼하게 검토해주시고 노무 담당자분도 의견을 다양하게 전해주셔서, 쉽고 간편하면서도 안전하고 문제 없는 서비스를 만드는 데에 큰 도움이 되었습니다.\n\nQ. 서비스 만드는 과정에서 발견한 근로계약서 작성 과정의 문제점은 무엇이었나요? 어떤 방향으로 해결했는지 궁금해요.\n.css-120saye{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;}첫째, 근로계약서 요청이 자연스러운 문화가 되게 하자.\n보통 근로계약의 사각지대에 놓인 아르바이트생들은, 고용주에게 “근로계약서를 작성하고 싶다”고 요청하는 단계에서부터 어려움을 느낍니다. 근로계약서를 작성하는 것이 당연한 고용주분들도 계시지만, 그렇지 않은 분들도 있거든요. 이런 환경에게는 근로자가 고용주에게 먼저 근로계약서를 작성하자고 하는 과정이 어려울 수 있어요. 근로자분들이 먼저 요청하는 과정이 조금이라도 덜 민망하도록, 토스뱅크를 통해 고용주에게 계약서 작성을 자연스럽게 요청할 수 있는 경로를 만들었습니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n둘째, 모바일 환경에 친숙한 계약서 서비스를 만들자.\n기존에 근로계약서를 작성할 수 있는 서비스는 대부분 유료로 운영되고, 데스크탑 환경에 최적화되어 있었어요. 접근성이 떨어지다보니 근로계약서 작성 과정이 더더욱 쉽지 않았겠죠.\n저희는 전국민이 사용하는 모바일 환경을 이용해 접근성을 최대한 좋은 쪽으로 제공하고자 했어요. 아무래도 모바일 화면에 담을 수 있는 정보는 데스크탑 대비 제한적이다 보니, 기존에 존재하던 서비스들과 전혀 다른 방식으로 설계했고요.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}[사장님이라면?] 업무 내용, 근로 일정, 임금 정보 등을 입력해서 근로계약서를 만들고, 직원의 정보를 입력하면 만든 근로계약서를 직원에게 보낼 수 있어요.\n* 토스 앱 내 경로: 전체 탭 > 우 상단 돋보기(검색) > ‘근로계약서’ 검색 > ‘토스뱅크 쉬운 근로계약서’\n무엇보다 계약서 작성 시작부터 계약 완료까지 중간에 서비스를 이탈하지 않고 끝낼 수 있도록 만들었어요. 보통의 토스뱅크 서비스에서는 본인 인증 과정에서 토스인증서를 꼭 필요로 하는데요. 이 과정에서 토스인증서를 발급받지 않은 분들이 이탈하면서 계약서 작성 과정이 흐지부지 되어버릴 수 있기 때문에, 화면에 서명을 그리는 직접서명 방식을 도입했어요. 계약 과정에서 이탈이 생길 수 있는 부분을 원천 봉쇄한 것이죠. 법무팀, 보안팀에서 많은 도움을 주셔서 구현할 수 있었습니다.\n\n[근로자라면?] 사장님이 작성해서 보낸 근로계약서를 잘 읽어보고, 잘못된 부분이 없다면 서명하면 돼요.\n* 토스 앱 내 경로: 전체 탭 > 우 상단 돋보기(검색) > ‘근로계약서’ 검색 > ‘토스뱅크 쉬운 근로계약서’\n셋째, 근로계약서 작성이 어렵고 두려운 일로 느껴지지 않게 만들자.\n근로계약서에는 익숙지 않은 개념이나 용어도 많고, 계약서라는 문서 특성상 문장도 전체적으로 어렵잖아요. 계약서 작성이 더이상 어렵고 두려운 일이 아닌 것으로 만들고 싶었어요. ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스를 따라가다 보면, 계약의 의미를 자연스럽게 이해하고 계약서 내용을 부담스럽지 않게 검토·작성할 수 있도록 곳곳에 장치를 두었습니다.\n\nQ. 사용자분들의 반응도 궁금해요. 기억에 남는 코멘트가 있을까요?\n브랜드 캠페인 영상에 감동적인 댓글이 많았던 게 기억에 남아요. “이것이 진정한 사회 기여다” 같은 취지의 댓글이 꽤 많이 보였거든요.\n조금 의외였지만 반가웠던 점은 사장님 고객들의 반응이 좋았다는 점이에요. 캠페인 타겟은 아르바이트생이었지만 사장님들의 반응도 만만치 않았던 거죠. 실제로 계약서 내 항목은 사장님이 작성해야 하는 부분이 더 많거든요. 특히 작은 사업을 1~2개 운영하는 분들의 긍정 목소리가 많았던 것 같아요. 사업자 번호를 여러 개 등록하고 싶다거나, 사업자 정보를 쉽게 수정하고 싶다는 반응을 보고, 바로 검토 후 의견을 반영하는 버전으로 서비스를 개선하기도 했어요.\n\nQ. ‘쉬운 근로계약서 서비스’를 더 많은 사람들에게 알리기 위해 두 번의 브랜드 캠페인을 진행하셨죠. 캠페인을 통해 전달하고자 했던 메시지가 궁금해요.\n토스뱅크 ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스 슬로건은 “일하는 누구나, 토스뱅크에서 안전하게” 입니다. 여기서 ‘누구’에는 근로자, 고용주 뿐 아니라 프리랜서도 포함되는데요. ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스로 가능한 정당한 계약을 통해, 모두가 마음놓고 안전하게 일할 수 있는 근로환경이 마련되어야 한다는 메시지를 전하고 싶었어요.\n\nQ. 각 브랜드 캠페인은 어떤 배경에서 기획되었고, 무엇을 목표로 진행되었나요?\n첫번째 사회공헌 프로젝트 ‘일하는 청소년 with Toss Bank’ 캠페인은 현실 속 청소년들이 근로 현장에서 맞닥뜨리게 되는 갈등에 주목했어요. 근로계약서 미작성, 청소년 노동법 위반 등의 갈등 원인은 근로계약 문화에 있다는 데 착안했고, 이를 바꾸겠다는 취지를 담았습니다.\n.css-oni540{position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;}\n.css-122y91a{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;}\n\n보통 청소년이 일한다고 하면 영 케어러(Young Carer: 가족돌봄청년), 문제아를 떠올리는데요. 공부를 해야 할 나이에 돈을 번다고 하니 피치 못할 사정이 있다고 생각하는 겁니다. 또 드라마나 광고 등 미디어를 통해 일하는 청소년의 이미지가 이런 방식으로 소비되었기 때문이에요.\n하지만 일하는 청소년들의 이야기를 직접 들어보니, 일하는 이유가 참 다양합니다. 가족을 위해 일하는 청소년 뿐 아니라, 원하는 신발을 사고 싶어서인 경우도 있고 꿈을 좇기 위해 강습비를 벌기도 해요. 이처럼 일하는 청소년에 대해 선입견을 가지지 않으려 노력했고, 이들이 겪는 근로 문제에만 집중했습니다. 실제 청소년 근로자들의 목소리를 반영하기 위한 노력이었어요.\n‘일하는 청소년’ 캠페인의 성공을 통해 근로계약 문제에 대한 대중의 공감대를 확인할 수 있었는데요. 그러던 중 서울시와의 협업을 통해 서울시에서 만든 간병인, 웹툰 보조작가 표준계약서가 ‘쉬운 근로계약서 서비스’에 탑재됐어요. 그 중에서 웹툰 보조작가가 겪는 문제에 공감해 두 번째 캠페인 소재로 선정하게 되었습니다.\n\n\n\n웹툰 보조작가는 계약서 미작성 건수가 77%에 달했어요. (2019 웹툰 보조작가 실태조사 기준: 한국콘텐츠진흥원) 웹툰 보조작가를 위한 표준계약서가 없었기 때문에, 대부분 구두 계약을 통해 일하고 있거나 계약서를 작성하더라도 불공정한 계약 조항에 노출되는 경우가 많았습니다. 그래서 계약 범위를 넘어서는 과도한 업무를 요구받기도 하고, 입금 체불도 빈번히 일어났어요. 또 다른 노동자와 다르게, 창작자임에도 크레딧(작품 내 이름 표기)에 포함되지 않아 향후 경력을 인정받거나 발전시키기 어려운 환경이었습니다.\n계약서만 잘 작성해도 막을 수 있는 문제인데, 계약서가 잘 작성되지 않는 환경에서 겪는 문제가 컸기에 ‘쉬운 근로계약서 서비스’를 통해 문제를 해결하고, 브랜드 캠페인을 통해 문제를 세상에 알리고자 했어요.\n\nQ. 광고 캠페인이었던 ‘일하는 청소년’과 달리, ‘웹툰노동’은 다큐멘터리로 제작되었는데요. 특별한 이유가 있을까요?\n처음엔 서울시에서 개발한 표준계약서가 토스뱅크 ‘쉬운 근로계약서 서비스’에 탑재되었다는걸 잘 알리는 수준으로 접근했어요. 그런데 왜 표준계약서가 개발됐고, 웹툰 보조작가분들이 어떤 어려움을 겪고 있는지 조사하다 보니 간단히 다룰 수 있는 소재가 아니라는 생각이 들더라고요.\n웹툰의 노동 문제는 플랫폼, 제작사, 웹툰작가, 웹툰 보조작가로 이어지는 제작 시스템 전반에서 비롯되며 이해관계가 복잡하게 얽혀있습니다. 이를 단편적으로 다룰 경우, 메시지가 왜곡될 우려가 있고 대중이 심각성을 충분히 공감하지 못할 가능성도 있다 생각했어요.\n또한 웹툰 보조작가들이 겪은 감정적인 상처가 깊어, 가벼운 접근은 오히려 그들의 아픔을 자극할 수 있다 생각했습니다. 정공법을 선택하자는 목표로 다큐멘터리 형식을 채택했어요. 메시지의 의미를 더욱 효과적으로 전달하기 위해 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}무비랜드 팝업, 캠페인 페이지, 한정판 굿즈도 추가로 기획했고요.\n\n\n특히 민감한 소재인 만큼 객관성 확보에 중점을 뒀어요. 20분 분량의 다큐멘터리에 10명의 출연진을 구성하는 것이 다소 많아보일 수 있지만, 소수의 주관적인 의견으로 비춰지는 것을 방지하고 다양한 시각을 담기 위해 가능한 많은 출연진을 섭외했습니다.\n웹툰 보조작가, 현역 웹툰작가, 웹툰작가노조위원장, 웹툰플랫폼사 대표, 변호사 등 해당 문제를 직간접적으로 경험하고, 실태를 면밀히 파악하고 있는 인물들이 참여했습니다. 많은 섭외 후보들이 출연을 고사했으나, 용기내어 주신 출연진분들 덕분에 목소리를 낼 수 있었습니다. 감사한 마음이 커요.\n\nQ. ‘웹툰노동’ 브랜드 캠페인 준비 과정에서 특별히 기억에 남는 순간이 있을까요?\n다큐멘터리 사전 인터뷰 과정에서 다큐멘터리에 나온 분들 외에도 수많은 보조작가분들과 업계 관계자분들을 만나 이야기를 들었거든요. 웹툰 업계에 분노하는 분, 어쩔 수 없다며 체념한 분, 우울증과 대인기피증을 가지게 된 분, 저마다의 방식으로 이 환경을 개선하려는 분들까지.\n그중 “제가 더 잘 했다면 이런 일은 없지 않았을까요?”라고 말하는 웹툰 보조작가들의 자책 어린 목소리가 유독 기억에 남습니다. 어려운 현실 속에서 많은 웹툰 보조작가들이 스스로를 탓하며 좌절하고 있었어요. 희망이 보이지 않는 상황에서, 그들이 비난할 수 있는 마지막 대상이 결국 자신뿐이 아니었을까 싶기도 했어요.\n이들을 위해 무비랜드 팝업에서 ‘블루 칼라(Blue-collar: 생산직 노동자)의 시인’으로 불리는 켄 로치 감독의 노동 영화 2편을 상영했는데요. 영화 ⟨나, 다니엘 블레이크⟩ ⟨미안해요, 리키⟩에 나오는 “It’s not your fault(당신의 잘못이 아닙니다).”라는 대사를 통해 위로를 전하고 싶었어요.\n\n켄 로치 감독은 칸 영화제에서 황금종려상 수상 후, “우리는 희망의 메시지를 사람들에게 보여줘야 한다. 다른 세상이 가능하다고 말해야 한다”라는 소감을 전했어요. ‘웹툰노동’ 다큐멘터리가 웹툰 보조작가분들께 희망의 메시지가 됐으면 하는 바람입니다.\n\nQ. 캠페인 공개 후 반응은 어땠나요?\n웹툰 보조작가분들이 본인의 이야기를 직접 유튜브 영상 댓글에 남겨주고 계세요. 다큐멘터리 내용에 공감하며 억울했던 감정을 쏟아내기도 하고, 더 적나라한 경험을 고발하거나 해결책을 제안하는 이들도 있습니다. 이런 다큐멘터리를 만들어줘서 고맙다는 분들도 많고요. 정성스레 남긴 장문의 댓글에서는 웹툰을 향한 애정과 하루 빨리 문제가 개선되길 바라는 마음이 느껴졌어요.\n웹툰 독자분들의 반응도 흥미로웠습니다. 그동안 웹툰을 문화 콘텐츠로 소비해 왔지만, 이면에 존재하는 문제에 대해서는 전혀 알지 못했다는 의견이 많았어요. 더 좋은 작품을 오랫동안 즐기기 위해서라도 웹툰 산업의 노동 환경이 개선되길 바란다는 목소리도 이어지고 있습니다.\n웹툰 관계자와 팬덤이 활발히 활동하는 X(구 트위터)에서는 현역 웹툰 작가들이 직접 다큐멘터리에 대한 글을 게시하고, 팬들이 이를 리트윗하며 바이럴이 확산되고 있어요. 노동 환경을 실질적으로 개선할 수 있는 당사자들에게까지 메시지가 닿아 현실적으로 문제를 해결할 수 있는 실마리가 되기를 기대합니다.\n\nQ. 캠페인이 콘텐츠 그 이상의 변화를 만들어내는 역할을 해온 것은 물론, 토스뱅크 CSR의 정체성 또한 잘 보여준 것 같아요.\n실질적인 변화를 만들기 위한 해결책을 제안하려 했기 때문인 것 같아요. 단순히 인식 개선을 위한 캠페인이 아니라, 토스뱅크가 가장 잘할 수 있는 제품(서비스) 역량을 활용해 문제를 해결하고자 했습니다. 그 결과물이 바로 ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스고요.\n\nQ. 실제로 ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스가 사회적으로 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있을 것으로 기대되는데요.\n맞아요, 우선 계약에 대한 심리적/물리적 장벽이 줄어드니까요. 토스뱅크를 활용하면 언제 어디서든 계약 요청부터 체결까지 손쉽게 할 수 있고, 계약 과정을 쉬운 언어로 전달하고 이해할 수 있잖아요. 그동안 공정한 계약문화 사각지대에 놓여있던 사람들이 가지고 있던 장벽을 낮춰줄 수 있으리라 기대합니다. 궁극적으로는 모두가 안전하게 계약을 체결하며 일하는 환경이 되는 데에 기여하길 바라고요.\n‘계약’에 대한 사회적 인식 변화 또한 필요한데요. 계약서를 작성하고 일하는 것이 필수적이고 자연스러운 문화로 자리매김하기 위해서는 계약이 어느 한 쪽의 이익을 대변하는 것이 아니라, 근로자와 고용주 모두를 위한 일종의 ‘약속’이라는 사회적인 인식이 꼭 필요하다 생각합니다. 그러면 사회적으로 근로계약 문화가 더욱 개선될 수 있을 거예요.\n\nQ. 캠페인 영상에 달린 댓글을 보면 “이런 게 진짜 세상에 필요한 혁신이다”, “사회에 꼭 필요한 이야기를 토스뱅크가 해준다”는 반응이 있더라고요.\nCSR의 일환으로 시작한 ‘쉬운 근로계약서’ 서비스가 ‘토스뱅크다운 혁신적인 시도’로 인식되는 것 같아요. 이제 기업이 문제를 해결하는 중요한 주체가 된 시대라 생각해요. 특히 고객의 어려움을 해결하는 것과 사회적 문제를 해결하는 것의 경계가 흐려질 때, 더 큰 브랜드 신뢰도를 가질 수 있다 생각합니다.\n은행의 사회적 책임 범위를 한정짓지 않고 사회적 문제를 해결하려 한 시도는, 그동안 당연하게 여겨져 왔던 불편함에 질문을 던지고 혁신적인 서비스를 만들어왔던 토스뱅크의 접근 방식과 다르지 않아요. CSR 활동이 기업의 본질적인 가치와 철학에 밀접해 있을 때, 더 큰 울림을 만들어내는 것 같습니다.\n\nQ. ‘쉬운 근로계약서 서비스’, 앞으로 어떻게 더 발전될까요?\n지금은 계약서를 작성하는 기능에 초점을 맞춘 서비스인데요. 더 나아가 고용주와 피고용인 간 계약서를 작성하는 상황 내 여러 맥락을 파악해, 근로자 고용 관련 서류까지 편리하게 발송할 수 있는 방향으로 발전시킬 예정이에요.\n그리고 이번 캠페인을 경험으로 생각해보면, 정부와 기업 간 유의미한 협업이 이어질 수 있지 않을까요. 그간 서울시는 운동트레이너, 간병인, 웹툰 보조작가와 같이 계약 문화의 사각지대에 놓인 프리랜서를 위한 표준계약서를 만들고 있었지만 확산에 어려움이 있었어요. 반면 토스뱅크는 전자계약 서비스를 제공할 뿐, 계약 당사자에게 법률적인 조언이나 가이드를 줄 수 없었고요. \n서울시가 만든 표준계약서를 토스뱅크 서비스에 탑재하니, 더 많은 사람들이 쉽고 간편하게 이용할 수 있게 되었잖아요. 이와 비슷하게 정부는 계속해서 사각지대에 놓여있는 직업군을 위한 기준이 되는 표준계약서를 발전시켜 나가고, 기업은 사용자에게 잘 전달할 수 있는 역할을 할 수 있기를 기대해 봅니다.",

찾다 보면 어느새 하루는 훌쩍 지나가죠. 오랜 경력의 프리랜서들도 세금 신고는 매번 까다롭다고 말하는데, 하물며 이제 막 프리랜서 세계에 발 디딘 분들에게는 이게 얼마나 복잡하고 어려운 일일까요?\n그래서 준비했습니다. 프리랜서라면 꼭 알아야 할 종합소득세 신고 방식. 귀중한 시간 아낄 수 있도록, 꼭 알아야 할 내용만 정리했어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}3.3% 뗐는데,\n세금은 왜 또 내야 하나요?\n프리랜서로 일을 하면 대부분 받기로 한 금액에서 3.3%를 떼고 받아요. 그래서 ‘이미 세금을 냈는데, 왜 또 종합소득세로 세금을 내는 거지?’ 하고 의아해하는 분들도 많습니다.\n이 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}3.3%는 소득세 3%와 지방소득세 0.3%를 원천징수한 것인데요. 이건 임시로 낸 세금에 가까워요. 세금은 소득에 비례해서 산출되는데, 실제로 내야 할 세금을 당장 실시간으로 알 수는 없으니 대략적으로 계산해서 미리 납부하는 거라고 생각하시면 돼요.\n실제로 납부할 세금은 종합소득세 신고를 통해 1년 동안의 소득, 지출, 공제 항목 등을 다 합산하고 계산해야 정확히 알 수 있어요. 이때 3.3%를 떼고 미리 납부한 세금과 비교해서 세금을 더 내거나 돌려받게 됩니다.\n프리랜서가 버는 돈은\n사업소득이에요\n세법에서는 프리랜서를 '개인이 물적 시설 없이 근로자를 고용하지 않고 독립된 자격으로 용역을 공급하고 대가를 받는 사람'으로 규정하고, 인적용역 사업자로 분류해요. 그래서 프리랜서가 일하고 받는 돈은 근로소득이 아니라 사업소득에 해당하죠.\n사업소득은 금액과 관계없이 종합소득세 신고 의무가 있고, 5월이 되면 종합소득세 안내문을 받게 됩니다. 평소엔 쓰지 않는 낯선 용어들이 많아 복잡하게 느껴질 수 있지만, 기본 개념 몇 가지만 알아두면 안내문을 이해하는 데 큰 도움이 돼요.\n세금을 합리적으로 내고 싶은 프리랜서라면 단순경비율과 기준경비율, 간편장부와 복식부기에 대해서는 꼭 알아두는 게 좋아요.\n추계신고,\n단순경비율과 기준경비율\n세금은 소득에 비례해 부과됩니다. 소득은 수입에서 경비를 뺀 금액이에요. 경비는 수입과 지출을 기록하는 장부를 통해 증빙하는 게 원칙이지만, 경비율을 적용하면 장부 없이도 일정 부분을 경비로 인정받을 수 있어요. 이를 추계신고라고 합니다.\n경비율은 ‘이 일을 하는 프리랜서라면 이 정도는 경비로 썼겠지’ 하고 국세청이 정한 추정 비율이에요. 정확한 경비율 수치와 적용 기준은 업종에 따라 달라지기 때문에, 내가 하는 일의 업종코드는 정확히 알아둬야 해요.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n단순경비율\n단순경비율은 장부를 작성할 여력이 없을 정도로 적은 소득을 얻는 사업자를 위한 제도예요. 증빙자료 없이도 수입의 일정 비율을 전부 경비로 인정하는 방식이죠.\n예를 들어 연 수입이 3,000만 원이고 단순경비율이 60%에 해당하는 프리랜서라면, 아무런 자료 없이 1,800만 원은 경비로 인정 받고, 나머지 1,200만 원에 대해서만 세금이 매겨집니다.\n업종에 따라 경비율 수치는 다르지만 대체로 높은 비율이 적용되기 때문에, 단순경비율 대상자라면 이를 활용하는 게 나은 선택인 경우가 많아요.\n기준경비율\n기준경비율은 단순경비율이 적용되지 않는 프리랜서에게 적용되는 방식이에요. 일정 수입 이상이거나 특정 업종*에 해당한다면 이 방식으로 신고하게 되죠. 기준경비율은 수입 전체에 비율을 곱하는 단순경비율과 달리, 교통비나 식비, 통신비 등 기타경비에만 일정 비율을 적용해 경비를 계산합니다.\n문제는 임차료, 인건비, 매입비 같은 주요경비가 전체 지출에서 큰 비중을 차지한다는 점이에요. 게다가 기준경비율은 단순경비율만큼 비율이 높지도 않아서, 기타경비로 인정받는 금액도 그리 크지 않죠. 그래서 기준경비율 대상자라면, 지출 자료를 잘 정리해 장부를 작성하고 기장신고를 하는 게 절세에 유리한 경우가 많습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 변호사, 회계사, 건축사, 약사 등 전문직 사업자는 수입 규모에 상관없이 기준경비율이 적용돼요\n\n기장신고,\n간편장부와 복식부기\n앞서 경비율을 적용한 추계신고에 대해 설명했지만, 세금은 수입과 지출을 기록한 장부를 기준으로 신고하는 게 원칙이에요. 이를 기장신고라고 해요. 기장신고에는 비교적 간단하게 장부를 작성하는 간편장부와, 회계 기준에 따라 정식 장부를 작성하는 복식부기 두 가지 방식이 있어요.\n정부는 업종을 도·소매업, 제조·건설업, 서비스업 등으로 나누고, 각 업종별로 수입 기준을 정해 기장 의무 여부를 다르게 설정해두었어요. 많은 프리랜서가 종사하고 있는 서비스업의 경우 연 수입이 7,500만 원 미만이면 간편장부를 쓸 수 있지만, 그 이상이라면 복식부기를 의무적으로 작성해야 해요.\n간편장부\n간편장부는 말 그대로 간편하게 장부를 작성해 신고하는 방식이에요. 국세청에서 제공하는 프로그램을 이용하면, 수입과 지출을 항목별로 가계부 쓰듯 채울 수 있어 전문적인 회계 지식 없이도 혼자서 충분히 작성할 수 있어요.\n간편장부의 가장 큰 장점은, 추계신고처럼 일정 비율로 계산하는 방식이 아니라 실제로 지출한 금액을 그대로 비용으로 인정받을 수 있다는 점이에요. 또한 적자가 발생한 경우에는 이월결손금 제도를 통해 최대 15년간 소득에서 이전에 발생한 손실금을 공제받을 수 있어요. 프리랜서 초기라서 적자를 보고 있지만, 나중에 사업 규모가 커지며 흑자 전환을 기대한다면 지금부터 간편장부를 써두는 게 좋습니다.\n.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}국세청 사이트에서는 간편장부 작성대상자 업종 기준을 확인할 수 있고, 간편장부 작성 프로그램도 다운받을 수 있어요.\n복식부기\n복식부기는 돈이 어디서 와서 어디로 갔는지를 차변과 대변으로 기록하는 장부 작성법이에요. 모든 수입과 지출을 꼼꼼히 기록하고, 그에 대한 증빙 자료도 함께 준비해야 하죠. 복잡하고 손이 많이 가지만, 실제 지출을 세세하게 반영할 수 있어 지출이 크거나 세무관리가 중요한 프리랜서에게는 적합한 방식입니다. 작성이 까다롭고 전문 지식이 필요하기 때문에 세무사 등 전문가의 도움을 받는 게 좋아요.\n간편장부 대상자라도 복식부기로 신고하면 기장세액의 20%를 감면받아 최대 100만 원까지 아낄 수 있어요. 세무사 비용보다 공제 혜택이 더 크다면 복식부기로 신고하는 게 유리하죠.\n\n* 대표적인 프리랜서에 해당하는 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}배달라이더의 소득세 신고방법이에요. 업종코드에 따라 경비율 수치와 적용기준, 복식부기 의무 기준 금액은 달라져요.\n몰라서 더 냈던 세금\n토스에서 찾아가세요\n나에게 잘 맞는 신고 방식을 잘 골랐다고 하더라도, 문득 ‘예전에도 이 경비를 챙겼었나?’, ‘공제 다 못 받아서 세금 더 낸 건 아닌가?’ 같은 생각이 들 때가 있어요. 마감에 맞춰 신고는 했더라도, 제대로 챙긴 게 맞는지는 나중에도 알기 어려우니까요.\n하지만 이미 지나간 신고라도, 놓친 세금 항목이 있었다면 지금이라도 돌려받을 수 있어요. ‘경정청구’라는 제도를 통해, 최대 5년 전까지 잘못 신고한 내용을 정정하고 환급금을 받을 수 있거든요.\n토스에서는 지난 종합소득세 신고에서 빠뜨린 경비나 공제 항목이 있었는지 꼼꼼히 찾아볼 수 있어요. 예전에 내가 더 낸 세금이 있었는지 토스에서 바로 확인해보세요. 놓쳤던 환급액을 찾게 될지도 몰라요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현
