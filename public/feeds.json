        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2024.06.15 release, 2024-06-10 tool release, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout June. This month’s release includes some error message improvements and bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,441 total ports available in the vcpkg public registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n9 new ports were added to the open-source registry.\n442 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n26 contributors submitted PRs, issues, or participated in discussions in the main repo.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,100 forks and 22,000 stars on GitHub.\n \nvcpkg changelog (2024.06.15 release)\nThe following meaningful changes were made in this release:\nFixed version export in SPDX module (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1400, thanks @xvitaly!).\nAdded missing --keep-going switch to x-set-installed (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1407, thanks @Neumann-A!).\nFixed misleading/incorrect error message triggering on an AWS S3 binary cache miss (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1404, thanks @petamas!).\nAll post-build checks now have skip policies. Also made some error messages more consistent in format, improved their output, and removed some duplicate messages (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1405).\n \nDocumentation changes\nMade references to the vcpkg curated registry more consistent throughout the docs. The curated registry is the main registry that ships with vcpkg and consists of 2400+ open-source ports (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#333).\nAdded clarification about why ports in the curated registry need to work simultaneously in the Maintainer guide (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#332).\nAdded mentions of IDEs/editors that officially support vcpkg in the Build system integration article (thanks @UnixY2K for providing the initial PR Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#325 for this effort!).\nAdded some recommended packages for pacman-based Linux distros (Article: Supported hosts; PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#326, thanks @UnixY2K!).\nAdded some clarifications for binary caching ABI hashing (Article: Binary caching reference; PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#330, thanks @Thomas1664!)\nRemoved some duplicate deprecation notices about CONTROL files in certain articles.\nFixed some typos (thanks @Thomas1664, @c8ef, and @pzychotic!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\n \nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,306\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,215\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,190\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,223\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,873\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,274\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,240\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,273\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,155\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,074\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,578\n\n\nx64-android\n1,651\n\n\narm64-android\n1,625\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\n \nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest article by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev.\nIf you ship Android app releases frequently, you probably already understand the value of well-defined build, test, and deployment workflows. Without resilient, automated DevOps workflows in place, it can be difficult to maintain a high release velocity. Automating these through continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) can make your life a lot easier and allow you to detect bugs earlier and release faster.\nJetBrains TeamCity is a CI/CD platform for building robust pipelines. It offers seamless integration with popular Android development tools and features a user-friendly interface for configuring build and test stages.\nThis article will show you how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for your Android project using JetBrains TeamCity. You’ll explore the key components of Android CI/CD pipelines and dive into configuring a few sample pipelines with TeamCity.\nUnderstanding the Android CI/CD pipeline\nAn effective CI/CD pipeline for Android development contains all of the steps included in a standard DevOps pipeline and augments it with additional processes like artifact signing and auto-deployment to internal tracks on the Google Play Store. Here is a quick overview of all the steps involved in a typical Android CI/CD pipeline:\n1. Code checkout and version control integration: The pipeline begins by fetching the latest code changes from your version control system (VCS), such as Git. If you’re using TeamCity, you’ll benefit from its integration with popular version control tools and automatic triggering of pipelines upon code commits or merges.\n2. Build automation with Gradle: Gradle, the standard build tool for Android projects, takes center stage in this step. TeamCity executes Gradle commands to compile your code, assemble resources, and generate build artifacts. TeamCity’s build runners provide compatibility with different Gradle versions and customizable environments for build configurations.\n3. Unit and integration testing for multiple Android versions/platforms: The next step involves running unit tests that verify individual code modules and integration tests (including UI tests) that check how different components interact. TeamCity allows you to configure multiple test runners and frameworks (e.g. JUnit, Espresso) and execute tests targeting various Android versions and platforms using emulators or device labs.\n4. Static code analysis (featuring JetBrains Qodana) and code coverage reporting: Static code analysis helps identify potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and coding style inconsistencies early on. TeamCity integrates with JetBrains Qodana, a static code analysis tool that offers features like code smell detection, complex code analysis, and integration with various programming languages, ensuring comprehensive code quality checks. Additionally, TeamCity can generate code coverage reports that indicate which parts of your code are exercised by unit tests. This helps developers focus on areas with weak coverage.\n5. Artifact generation and signing (APKs and AABs): After successful builds and tests, the next step involves creating deployable artifacts. For Android apps, this typically involves generating signed Android Package Kits (APKs) or Android App Bundles (AABs). TeamCity allows you to automate the signing process within the pipeline using build steps.\n6. Deployment to internal testing and production environments (Google Play, beta channels): CI/CD pipelines can automate app deployment to various environments. TeamCity allows configuration for deploying to internal testing platforms or directly to production channels on Google Play.\n7. Continuous monitoring and feedback loops: A robust CI/CD pipeline doesn’t end with deployment. TeamCity integrates with monitoring tools, enabling you to track app performance, identify crashes, and gather user feedback. This feedback loop allows developers to react quickly to issues and continuously improve their app’s quality.\nBuilding the pipeline with TeamCity\nNow that you’ve explored the general CI/CD pipeline structure, let’s dive into building one using TeamCity. The following sections guide you through setting up TeamCity, creating build configurations tailored to your Android project, integrating automated testing, and finally, configuring packaging and deployment of your app.\nTo keep things simple, this tutorial uses the cloud-hosted version of TeamCity, which comes with a fourteen-day free trial. You can sign up for it using your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Google Account, or by using the old-school combination of your email address and password. Make sure to activate your trial or subscription before moving to the next step. \nHowever, you can also use TeamCity Cloud with self-hosted build agents or even TeamCity On-Premises for the purposes of this tutorial. Keep in mind that using self-hosted build agents or TeamCity On-Premises would require you to install Android SDK on your agents separately.\nSetting up TeamCity\nOnce you have access to a TeamCity Cloud instance, here’s what your initial view will look like:\nTeamCity Cloud dashboard\n\n\n\nTo get started with an Android project, click Create project… in the middle of the page. Then, you’ll be asked to provide a link to the source code of your project. If you signed up using a Git hosting provider (such as GitHub or Bitbucket Cloud), feel free to check out its corresponding section and use its dedicated project creation process. \nHowever, if you have the repository URL, you can directly use it in the From a repository URL tab. TeamCity will automatically detect the Git hosting provider and pull in your project from there.\nCreate Project page\n\n\n\nIf you don’t have an Android project at hand, you can use the following repository to follow the tutorial:\nbash\nhttps://github.com/krharsh17/android-app-teamcity\nIf the repository you’re trying to access is private or secured using a username and password combination, you can provide it here so that TeamCity can access it. Once you’ve entered the repository URL (and any additional details as needed), click Proceed.\nOn the next page, TeamCity Cloud will verify the connection to the VCS repository. Once it’s successful, TeamCity will pull in some metadata related to the project, such as its name, its default branch, etc. You can modify these values before they are stored in the TeamCity project.\nConnection verified when creating project\n\n\n\nOnce you’re happy with the information on this page, click the Proceed button. TeamCity will then begin to automatically detect any build steps applicable to the repository based on the available configuration files in the repository. Since this repository has Gradle-based configuration files, it will automatically suggest a set of Gradle tasks you can use to build the app from the repository (in this case, clean and build).\nCheck the box next to the Gradle build step, and click Use selected:\nSelecting auto-suggested build steps\n\n\n\nOnce done, you’ll receive a small banner saying you can now run the first build in the project. Click Run at the top right to start the first build:\nStarting your first build\n\n\n\nOnce you click the button, a build will be queued, which will then wait for a build agent to become available. You can click Projects in the top navigation pane and choose the running build to view its properties and status:\nRunning build details\n\n\n\nThe build will be completed in about 5–6 minutes. Congratulations! You’ve set up your first Android CI/CD pipeline with TeamCity. Also, since you used a VCS repository URL to set up this pipeline, it’s been configured to automatically poll the repository URL at fixed intervals to see if any new changes have been pushed to the repo. If new changes are found, the pipeline will automatically pull the latest commit and run the build again.\nYou can further enhance this by setting up platform-specific webhooks. For instance, the repository you just set up is hosted on GitHub. TeamCity allows you to conveniently install a GitHub webhook so that GitHub automatically sends out a notification to TeamCity every time there is some activity on the repo:\nInstalling GitHub webhook\n\n\n\nYou can go ahead and do that if you’d like to. However, it’s not necessary for the purposes of this tutorial.\nConfiguring build artifacts\nThe repository you have set up includes two flavors (Free and Paid). For both of these flavors, there are two build variants (debug and release). This means that the result of a build task will include four binary files, one for each of the possible combinations of flavors and variants. Let’s configure the pipeline to extract and make these artifacts available for access after the pipeline has finished running.\nTo do that, click Projects in the top navigation pane and click Build under Android App Teamcity to open the details page for the build configuration titled Build:\nNavigating to build configuration page\n\n\n\nHere, click the Edit configuration button in the top right-hand corner of the screen:\nEditing your build configuration\n\n\n\nThis is where you can configure the general settings for your build configuration. You’ll notice there’s a field titled Artifact paths towards the bottom of the list. This is where you need to define the paths of the artifacts that you wish to extract and retain after the build finishes running:\nSetting artifact paths\n\n\n\nWhen you run the Gradle build task, the artifacts generated by Gradle are stored in app/build/outputs/apk. Therefore, you need to enter the following under Artifact paths:\napp/build/outputs/apk/*/*/* => output\nYou add /*/*/* after app/build/outputs/apk because the complete path of an APK binary generated after a build looks like this: app/build/outputs/apk/<flavor>/<variant>/app-<flavor>-<variant>-unsigned.apk.\nTo accommodate all possible values of <variant>, <flavor>, and binary file names, we’ve used the wildcard *. \n=> is a feature of Ant-style paths and is used to separate output and input directories. output is the name of the folder in which the final binaries will be stored.\nOnce you’ve added this, click the Save button at the bottom of the page. You’ll see a yellow banner saying your changes have been saved:\nSaving changes made to build configuration\n\n\n\nYou can now try running the pipeline again using the Run button at the top right of the page to view the generated artifacts after the build is completed:\nViewing the generated artifacts\n\n\n\nYou’ve now set up a pipeline that’s triggered every time a commit is pushed to the main branch of your repo. This pipeline generates unsigned build artifacts for all flavor-variant combinations in your project, runs unit tests, and makes the build artifacts available for viewing.\nNext, you’ll learn how to customize tests.\nCustomizing tests\nAs mentioned before, the Gradle task build also takes care of running unit tests on all generated build artifacts. However, there can be situations where you only want to run tests on a few variants of your app. In that case, you need to replace the clean build tasks with the appropriate tasks for your use case.\nFor instance, if you want to create an unsigned APK for the release variant of the free flavor of the app and run unit tests on it, you would replace clean build with assembleFreeRelease testFreeReleaseUnitTest. To do that, click on Projects in the top navigation pane and then click Build under Android App Teamcity. On the next page, click the Edit configuration button at the top right, just like you did in the previous step.\nYou should be on the General Settings page for the build configuration, which you accessed earlier to configure the artifacts path. On the left navigation pane, click Build Step: Gradle.\nNavigating to build settings\n\n\n\nThis will open the Build Steps page, where you can modify the build steps for this build configuration. Click Edit on the right side of the first build step (titled Gradle):\nEditing Gradle build step\n\n\n\nYou can now update the Gradle tasks field to change the tasks that will be executed as part of this build. Replace clean build with assembleFreeRelease testFreeReleaseUnitTest:\nUpdating Gradle tasks\n\n\n\nNow, click Save at the bottom. Once the changes are saved, click the Run button at the top right. This will trigger another run of this build configuration.\nOnce the build finishes running, you can take a look at the reports generated by TeamCity in the Tests tab on the build run details page:\nViewing test results\n\n\n\nFor each of the unit tests, you can view how long it took to run and if there was any stack trace left after the test was completed. You can also click the three dots on the far right of the test and select Show test history to compare the performance of the current run of the test with its past runs:\nComparing test run history\n\n\n\nYou can assign the investigation of a test to a team member and track its investigation history through TeamCity itself. If you’d like, you can also download the test results by clicking the Download link on the test overview page.\nThe number of tests in this repo is quite small, so the build run was completed in a few minutes. However, in a real-world project, there are usually hundreds, if not thousands, of unit tests. In such a situation, running all of these tests on the same runner agent one after another would take a significant amount of time. To solve this, you can use TeamCity’s parallel tests build feature.\nTeamCity is capable of parallelizing your test runs by splitting them over multiple build agents, helping you to minimize the overall time it takes to run all the tests. To set this up, click the Edit configuration button on the build run details page and click Build Features on the left navigation pane:\nNavigating to the Build Features page\n\n\n\nOn the Build Features page, click the + Add build feature button. In the dialog box that opens, choose Parallel tests in the dropdown menu:\nSearching for parallel tests\n\n\n\nYou need to enter the maximum number of batches for executing tests in parallel. Enter a value between 4 and 8 to get the maximum benefit from parallelization.\nSetting up parallel build batches\n\n\n\nOnce done, click the Save button. You can now try running tests for a repository that has a larger number of test cases to see the difference in performance for yourself!\nManaging multiple builds\nSince this app has multiple flavors and variants, it would make sense to make use of the matrix builds offered by TeamCity to speed up build pipelines by splitting each variant-flavor combination into its own run instance. Additionally, this also allows you to build specific combinations of the application without having to necessarily build all or just one variant-flavor combination.\nTo do this, you need to create a new build configuration. Click Projects in the top navigation pane and click Android App Teamcity. On the project details page, click the Edit project… button in the top right-hand corner:\nNavigating to project configuration\n\n\n\nOn the General Settings page, click the + Create build configuration button under the Build Configurations section:\nCreating a new build configuration\n\n\n\nThis will take you to the Create Build Configuration wizard. Enter the same repository URL as before (https://github.com/krharsh17/android-app-teamcity) in the Repository URL field and click Proceed:\nEntering repository URL\n\n\n\nSet the Build configuration name on the next page to Matrix Builds, and leave the default values in all other fields. Then, click the Proceed button:\nSetting build configuration details\n\n\n\nTeamCity will notify you that a similar VCS root has been found. Click the Use this button in this dialog box:\nChoosing an existing VCS root\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that TeamCity polls the VCS URL only once for both of these build configurations to avoid additional performance overhead.\nOnce the build configuration is complete, you should get a notification confirming it has been created:\nNew build configuration created\n\n\n\nThis time, you don’t need to set up the clean build Gradle tasks, so don’t check any boxes on this page. Instead, click the link above the table that says configure build steps manually.\nYou’ll be taken to the New Build Step page, where you can choose your preferred runner for the build step:\nSelecting a build runner\n\n\n\nChoose Gradle from this list. On the next page that opens, enter clean test%env.FLAVOR%%env.VARIANT% in the Gradle tasks field:\nEntering a Gradle task\n\n\n\nThis will ensure that the runner first cleans the build folders and then runs the test task for the flavor and variant provided by the environment variables. For example, for the release variant of the free app, the task would be called clean testFreeRelease.\nScroll down and click the Save button. You’ll then be taken back to the Build Steps page:\nNew build step added\n\n\n\nClick the + Add build step button and add another Gradle build step with the task assemble%env.FLAVOR%%env.VARIANT%. This step will generate build artifacts for the given flavor and variant of the app.\nOnce done, your Build Steps page should list the two Gradle-based build steps you created with a quick summary of the Gradle tasks that will be run as part of them:\nBuild steps updated\n\n\n\nNow, you need to do two more things: define the values for the two environment variables you used and configure artifact paths.\nYou already know how to set the artifact paths for a build configuration. For this build configuration, set the value of the Artifact paths field to app/build/outputs/apk/*/*/* => output, the same as for the previous one.\nTo set the matrix values for the flavor and variant fields, click Build Features on the left navigation pane. On the Build Features page, click the + Add build feature button and search for Matrix Build in the dropdown menu in the dialog box:\nSearching for Matrix Build on the Build Features page\n\n\n\nOnce you select the Matrix Build option from the dropdown list, you’ll be asked to provide parameters for the matrix build along with their values. Provide a parameter’s name as env.FLAVOR and its value as Free. Add another parameter, env.VARIANT, with two values: Release and Debug.\nConfiguring matrix build\n\n\n\nNow, click the Save button. This completes the setup of matrix builds on this pipeline. You can try testing it by clicking the Run button in the top right-hand corner of the page.\nYou’ll now be able to view the results of each run separately, along with separate build artifacts and test results.\nMatrix build results\n\n\n\nYou can click the Dependencies tab to view the build run details for each of the individual runs:\nViewing individual build run details\n\n\n\nAs you’ve seen before, you can explore each of these entries as a standalone, complete build run.\nPackaging and deployment\nOne key part of an Android CI/CD pipeline is pushing out the release binaries to Google Play so they can be published to users. You can use TeamCity and Gradle Play Publisher (GPP) to automate this as well.\nThere are a few prerequisites before you start this process:\n1. Make sure you have manually uploaded the first APK/AAB for your Android project to Google Play Console.\n2. You must have a valid signing configuration.\n3. You need to create a service account on Google Cloud Platform to be able to use the Google Play Developer APIs and retrieve its JSON credentials file. To do this, follow these steps before progressing to the next step.\nOnce you’ve completed the steps detailed in the link above, you need to install and configure GPP in your Android project. To do that, add the following line of code to the plugins block in the app-level build.gradle.kts file:\nkt\nid(\"com.github.triplet.play\") version \"3.9.1\"\nThen, at the root level of this file, add a new play {} block with the following content:\nkt\nplay {\n    serviceAccountCredentials.set(file(\"play_config.json\"))\n    track.set(\"internal\")\n    releaseStatus.set(ReleaseStatus.DRAFT)\n    defaultToAppBundles.set(true)\n}\nThis configures GPP to use the service account credentials from a file named play_config.json, set the track to internal and release status to DRAFT when pushing binaries to Play Console, and use app bundles in place of APKs by default.\nThis concludes the necessary configuration steps for your Android project. Commit and push these changes to the GitHub repository before proceeding.\nYou’ll now create a new build configuration for pushing binaries to Google Play in TeamCity. Follow the same steps as before to create a new build configuration. Set the first build step to use Gradle as the runner and bundleFreeRelease as the Gradle task to run:\nBuild steps\n\n\n\nAdd another step to this build configuration, but choose Command Line as the build runner this time:\nConfiguring a new command line build step\n\n\n\nThe new build step page for the command line runner will open. You need to provide the custom script that signs and publishes the app bundle to Google Play. Enter the following code in the Custom script field:\n# Create the keystore file from the environment variables\necho %env.ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE% > keystore.jks.b64\nbase64 -d -i keystore.jks.b64 > app/keystore.jks\n\n# Sign the AAB using the keystore and credentials retrieved from the environment variables\njarsigner \\\n-keystore app/keystore.jks \\\n-storepass %env.KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD% \\\n-keypass %env.KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD% \\\n-signedjar release.aab \\\napp/build/outputs/bundle/freeRelease/app-free-release.aab \\\n%env.KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS%\n\n# Create the GCP service account credentials file from the environment variables\necho %env.PLAY_CONFIG_JSON% > play_config.json.b64\nbase64 -d -i play_config.json.b64 > app/play_config.json\n\n# Use GPP to publish the app bundle\n./gradlew publishFreeBundle --artifact-dir release.aab\nThe code has inline comments to explain what each line does. Once done, click the Save button at the bottom of the page:\nConfiguring your command line script\n\n\n\nYou also need to define the following environment variables to provide the script with the right credentials to sign and publish the app:\nbash\nANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE\nKEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS\nKEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD\nKEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD\nPLAY_CONFIG_JSON\nClick Parameters in the left navigation pane to go to a page where you can define these environment variables. You’ll see that TeamCity has already populated the list of required variables on this page for you:\nViewing newly recognized environment variables\n\n\n\nFor KEYSTORE_KEY_ALIAS, KEYSTORE_KEY_PASSWORD, and KEYSTORE_STORE_PASSWORD, feel free to click Edit and provide their values in the resultant dialog boxes:\nConfiguring environment variables\n\n\n\nFor ANDROID_KEYSTORE_FILE and PLAY_CONFIG_JSON, you first need to convert the files into Base64 using a tool like openssl, and then paste the Base64-encoded contents into the value fields of these variables.\nThis sets up the pipeline to build and publish a signed release of the free version of your application. You can try clicking the Run button at the top right of the page to trigger a run and see it in action.\nOnce the run succeeds, you’ll see a BUILD SUCCESSFUL message in the logs:\nSuccessful build result logs\n\n\n\nAnd here is the latest release of your app, available on the internal track in Google Play Console and ready for you to edit and promote:\nPlay Console internal testing page\n\n\n\nYou’ll notice that the new release has the same developer-facing name (“2.0”) as the previous one. This is because no name was specified in GPP’s configurations. You can take a look at the GPP documentation to learn how to do that yourself.\nBest practices and tips\nNow that you can set up your own pipeline for Android using TeamCity, here are a few key best practices you can consider implementing to ensure your pipelines are efficient and fast:\n1. Version control and versioning practices: An effective CI/CD pipeline strongly depends on a robust version control system (VCS) like Git. Ensure your team adheres to clear versioning practices and implements a consistent branching strategy (e.g. feature branches). Develop customized pipelines for different branches to ensure you aren’t running unnecessary steps on WIP code, for instance.\n\n\n\n\n2. Clear pass/fail criteria and thresholds: Clearly define what constitutes a successful build and test run. This can involve setting thresholds for unit test coverage, getting a green light on other code checks, and so on. You should configure TeamCity with pass/fail criteria for each stage of the pipeline to ensure robust builds and encourage developers to write better code.\n3. Leveraging TeamCity notifications and alerts: TeamCity offers a detailed notification system to help notify users about pipeline events across web browsers, email, Slack, and IDEs. Make sure to set up alerts for build failures and critical test failures to keep your development team informed and allow for prompt issue resolution.\n4. Collaboration and feedback loop: An effective CI/CD pipeline fosters collaboration within your development team. You should use build pipeline visualization within TeamCity to provide developers with a clear picture of the entire build and test process. You can also use test and build investigations to assign and collaborate on investigations into why a build or a test failed, right within TeamCity. Also, encourage team members to review build failures and code coverage reports to identify areas for improvement. This can help develop a culture of code quality and continuous improvement.\n5. Security measures (code signing and access control): Make sure to configure your TeamCity instance with proper access controls, restricting access to sensitive information like signing keys to only those users who need access to the information. You should consider using a tool like HashiCorp Vault to manage and rotate all sensitive credentials that you might be using in your builds. You can check out a few other key security recommendations from TeamCity here.\nConclusion\nIn this article, you learned how to build and manage a detailed CI/CD pipeline for your Android development projects using JetBrains TeamCity. You explored the key stages of an Android CI/CD pipeline, from code checkout and version control integration to signing, deployment, and monitoring. You learned how TeamCity facilitates each stage and streamlines your development workflow.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Task Parallel Library (TPL) is foundational to all .NET applications, as it allows frameworks to write and execute multithreaded and parallel code. Additionally, developers looking to get the most out of their resources may want to write custom code, taking advantage of the types found in System.Threading and System.Threading.Tasks. You must understand concurrency and threading fundamentals to write fast and scalable solutions, including locks, deadlocks, awaits, and scheduling. Part of expanding your understanding of these concepts requires excellent tooling to help you visualize and make sense of a potentially chaotic swarm of executing tasks.\nExciting news! We’ve recently launched the first iteration of our Tasks view, a powerful tool designed to help you understand the existing tasks in the current application process. \nIn this post, we’ll examine the new tool window, discuss its essential UI elements, and demonstrate some common scenarios. You’ll be ready to explore your code bases and uncover optimization opportunities by the end.\nDownload & try JetBrains Rider\n                                                    \nTask Execution in .NET Applications\nIn .NET, Tasks offer an abstraction over concepts like concurrency and multithreading. The idea is to worry less about CPU cores and threads and deal with the high-level concepts of scheduling and executing work concurrently. This is generally great since it can help developers write more imperative code while efficiently utilizing all their system resources.\nWhile abstractions are reasonably good, no abstraction is perfect, and at some point, you’ll have to deal with the pitfalls of multiple tasks concurrently. These include deadlocks, race conditions, and inefficient scheduling that causes backpressure. Dealing with abstractions doesn’t mean you should not understand how and why they work.\nTypically, you will be responsible for scheduling tasks but never know when and how those tasks will be completed. Execution is the job of the .NET runtime. While you might see particular code patterns that are a sign of trouble to come, the best way to diagnose issues with Tasks is at runtime. Let’s look at some common scenarios you might uncover in your codebase and see how the Tasks view can help you better understand your applications.\nCommon Tasks\nThe most likely scenario when working with tasks is consuming an API that returns tasks that require the async and await keywords. These asynchronous APIs are in ASP.NET Core, MAUI, and Entity Framework Core. Many open-source projects have also moved to async-first APIs to support developer needs.\nLet’s take a look at a simple example.\nawait BasicWork();\r\n\r\nasync Task BasicWork()\r\n{\r\n    await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1));\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"👋 Hello Tasks View!\");\r\n}\r\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nIn this example, we have two tasks: The main task originating from our program and the BasicWork method. We can confirm this by using the new Tasks View. While in a debugging session, click the Tasks tab to view the following table.\nJetBrains Rider’s Tasks View in Table mode\nYou can also switch to a Graph view by choosing the option at the top right.\nJetBrains Rider’s Tasks View in Graph mode\nYou can also see the row information in the graph view by hovering over any stack item.\nShowing the row in the graph view\nWhen working with Tasks, there are five statuses any task can have at any one time:\nActive: Currently executing and running.\nScheduled: The task has been created but has not yet been executed.\nAwaiting: The task has been awaited but may be awaiting other tasks.\nBlocked: This task is at the top of the stack, and the thread executing it is blocked (sleep, waiting on lock, etc.). There are also some other tasks higher in the stack.\nDeadlocked: The task is in contention for a resource, and there’s a severe problem.\nNow that we’ve seen the most common scenario, let’s look at parented tasks.\nParented Tasks\nThe act of parenting allows developers to logically group tasks. When creating a task within a task, you can use the TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent to tie any new task to the containing task.\nawait ParentedTasks();\r\n\r\nTask ParentedTasks()\r\n{\r\n    // Parent task\r\n    var parentTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Parent task started.\");\r\n\r\n        // Child task\r\n        var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Child task started.\");\r\n            Task.Delay(2000).Wait(); // Simulating some work\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Child task completed.\");\r\n        }, TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent);\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Parent task doing some work.\");\r\n    }, TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent);\r\n\r\n    // Wait for parent task to complete, which includes the children\r\n    parentTask.Wait();\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Parent task completed.\");\r\n    return Task.CompletedTask;\r\n}\r\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nIf you run the code and look at the Task view, you’ll see that we’ve successfully parented the child task.\nShowing a task parented to another\nNote that each new task has an integer Id assigned by the .NET runtime. These identifiers help you keep track of tasks that exist in your current process.\nThis time, the graph view shows two async logical stacks resulting from the ParentedTasks code, which uses methods like Wait and returning Task.CompletedTask. \nShowing two async logical stacks\nThat’s cool. Understanding whether tasks are related or have created separate logical stacks can help you understand if you’ve created a potential race condition.\nLet’s see how the Tasks view can help us see how work is scheduled.\nScheduling Tasks\nAny time you await a task, you effectively schedule that work for a future time. That work can happen immediately after scheduling a task or after other scheduled tasks have been executed. Let’s see an example where we schedule several tasks and wait for them to complete.\nawait ScheduledWork();\r\nasync Task ScheduledWork()\r\n{\r\n    Console.Write(\"Let's work...\");\r\n    var tasks = Enumerable\r\n        .Range(1, 10)\r\n        .Select((i) => Task.Run(() => Console.Write(i)));\r\n\r\n    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);\r\n}\r\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nThe use of the Task.WhenAll attempts to execute all the supplied tasks, with all of them being scheduled for future execution. You can see this in the Tasks view.\nScheduled tasks from the 10 created tasks\nAdditionally, the use of Task.WhenAll creates an async logical stack under which all these operations can run.\nTwo async logical stacks with one showing 10 values\nWhen you step through the code during the debugging session, you’ll see the list of Tasks reduced as tasks are completed. You may also notice multiple tasks being executed at the same time.\nA dwindling set of tasks in the tasks view\nIt’s satisfying to see tasks completed, but it’s not great when they overstay their welcome. Let’s move on to the scariest scenario when dealing with tasks: deadlocks.\nDeadlocks\nThe most common cause of a deadlock is contention around a shared resource guarded by some locking mechanism. Locks are essential when dealing with shared resources but can lead to app-breaking issues.\nLet’s create a deadlock now because we love to live dangerously. More importantly, we’ll see how the Tasks view can help us identify it. We’ll schedule two tasks, each trying to lock the same variables.\nawait Deadlock();\r\n\r\n// This method will cause a deadlock\r\n// proceed with caution, oOOoOOoOo! 👻\r\nasync Task Deadlock()\r\n{\r\n    object one = new();\r\n    object two = new();\r\n\r\n    var timer = new System.Timers.Timer(\r\n        TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2)\r\n    ) { Enabled = true, AutoReset = false };\r\n\r\n    timer.Elapsed += (_, _) =>\r\n    {\r\n        // only see this if we're deadlocked\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"💀Deadlock\");\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    await Task.WhenAll(Task.Run(() =>\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Getting lock for one.\");\r\n        lock (one)\r\n        {\r\n            Thread.Sleep(1000);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Getting lock two in first task.\");\r\n            lock (two)\r\n            {\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }), Task.Run(() =>\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Getting lock two in second task.\");\r\n        lock (two)\r\n        {\r\n            Thread.Sleep(1000);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Getting lock one in second task.\");\r\n            lock (one)\r\n            {\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }));\r\n}\r\n\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nWhen you run the code, you’ll notice the application never exits. In the Run toolbar, hit the pause button to pause the application. Oh no, a deadlock! I’m shocked! (well, I’m not that shocked).\nA deadlocked pair of tasks in the tasks table view\nThe graph view is even more telling, showing the two tasks in contention and how we got here.\nA deadlocked pair of tasks in the tasks graph view\nDouble-clicking on any of the deadlocked logical stacks will take you to the location of the deadlock.\nShowing the code that is causing the deadlock in JetBrains Rider\nThat ease of navigation should make finding and solving deadlocks, well, dead simple.\nConclusion\nThe Tasks view is currently available in JetBrains Rider 2024.2 EAP, and we’d love to hear your feedback so you can help shape this tool’s future. We understand that tasks can be a challenging part of .NET development, and we hope this additional tooling can help you overcome them. Try it and see if it can help you optimize existing code or find longstanding issues in your codebase.\nThanks for reading, and we look forward to your thoughts and comments.\nDownload the latest version!\n                                                    \nimage credit: Eden Constantino",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The latest installment in the Early Access Program for ReSharper 2024.2 has just been released! This preview build marks an important milestone – it is the first one to feature asynchronous typing, an important design change for ReSharper on its way to out-of-process operation. In addition to that, the update also brings several updates across C++ support, C# refactoring, the decompiler, dotTrace, dotMemory, and the Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA) tool window.\nLet’s dive in!\nDownload the EAP build \n                                                    \nAsynchronous typing enabled\nAsynchronous typing is part of an ongoing effort to improve ReSharper’s performance by enabling it to run out of process with Visual Studio. ReSharper 2024.2 EAP 5 is the first build to feature this important change.\nTraditionally, ReSharper used a synchronous model for handling user inputs. Each keystroke would trigger a series of actions requiring ReSharper to obtain a write lock, pause background processes, and then synchronize its internal model with what is displayed in the Visual Studio editor. This process, although typically quick, could introduce noticeable delays, especially in complex scenarios where extensive code analysis and formatting were needed.\nThe shift to asynchronous typing decouples these operations from the main typing process. By doing so, ReSharper can handle input in the Visual Studio editor without waiting for background tasks to complete. This change reduces the blocking time for write lock, thereby minimizing interruptions and improving the responsiveness of the editor.\n\n\n\n\nOur internal tests show a marked improvement in the smoothness of the typing experience. We’d love to hear about your perceptions over on our issue tracker. While we’re optimistic about enabling async typing for the 2024.2 release, further testing is still needed, and that’s why your feedback is particularly important. \nSupport for the C++23 multidimensional subscript operator\nThe latest build introduces support for the C++23 multidimensional subscript operator. Previously, accessing elements in a multidimensional array required either chaining multiple subscript operators (e.g. arr[i][j][k]) or using function call syntax (e.g. arr(i, j, k)), both of which could be cumbersome and less readable.\nWith the new C++23 feature, you can now use a single subscript operator with multiple indices (e.g. arr[i, j, k]). This change simplifies the syntax and makes the code more readable and consistent with how single-dimensional arrays are accessed, thereby reducing the cognitive load.\nExtract common code refactoring for C#\nReSharper’s latest refactoring enhancement enables you to extract common code out of branching statements such as if or switch. This update streamlines and consolidates shared logic, ensuring it is executed regardless of the branching path, improving code readability, and reducing redundancy.\nDecompiler enhancements\nThe decompiler in ReSharper 2024.2 EAP 5, as well as the standalone dotPeek application, sees another usability improvement with the introduction of the Open in Browser action. This action provides two navigation options:\nNavigate to GitHub: You can now open external sources directly in your browser and navigate to the source repository on GitHub. This is accessible via the context menu in the Assembly Explorer or within the code.\nNavigate to the NuGet package repository: Similarly, you can navigate to the NuGet package repository directly from the context menu on the NuGet node. This seamless integration saves time and enhances your workflow by providing quick access to source code and documentation.\ndotTrace \nWe have resolved the issue with missing kernel sampling events in Timeline mode (DTRC-30949).\nThe View | Options tool window is now available in the dotTrace Viewer on macOS and Linux. Settings like Web Proxy, Call Tree Folding, Subsystems, and Source View can be configured.\ndotMemory\nThe dotMemory version for Linux and macOS gets features that were previously available only on Windows:\nAutomatic memory inspections: dotMemory for Linux and macOS gets the Inspections view, which shows a number of automatically detected memory issues.\nCross-workspace snapshot comparison: Now, you can compare snapshots from different profiling sessions, allowing for a more comprehensive memory analysis and comparison of snapshots contained in different dotMemory workspaces.\nThese features are also available in the built-in dotMemory plugin in JetBrains Rider.\nExplain with AI for Dynamic Program Analysis tool window\nThe Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA) tool window now features an Explain with AI button for issues related to memory allocation and database problems. This AI-driven feature offers detailed explanations and advice from AI Assistant on potential fixes directly within the Dynamic Program Analysis tool window to help you quickly understand and resolve even the most complex issues associated with memory allocation and working with databases. \n\n\n\n\nFor the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.\nDownload the EAP build \n                                                    \nAs always, we’re happy to hear your thoughts on the latest updates in the comments section or on our social media.

As always, your feedback is invaluable in helping us refine these updates, so we encourage you to try out the new build and share your thoughts.\nDownload the EAP build \n                                                    \nUX/UI\nReader mode\nReader mode is now available in Rider 2024.2 EAP 5. It’s designed to make reading library and read-only files, including decompiled ones, a whole lot easier, and it includes inline rendering of documentation comments for C# and F#, as well as virtual indenting for C#.\n\n\n\n\nVirtual indenting modifies the style of read-only code to match your preferred layout. \nExtract common code refactoring for C#\nRider’s latest refactoring enhancement enables you to extract common code out of branching statements such as if or switch. This update streamlines and consolidates shared logic, ensuring it’s executed regardless of the branching path, improving code readability, and reducing redundancy.\nSticky lines for C++ \nIn addition to the sticky lines for preprocessor directives introduced in EAP 3, Rider 2024.2 now offers sticky lines for accessibility specifiers in C++. \nAccessibility specifiers (public, protected, and private) define the access control for class members. The new sticky lines feature keeps these specifiers visible at the top of the editor window as you scroll, helping you quickly identify access levels and better manage complex class hierarchies by maintaining constant visibility of the encapsulation and inheritance structure.\nEnhanced Monitoring tool window\nThe Monitoring tool window inside Rider 2024.2 supports a broader range of application types. This tool window is now displayed during running and debugging for the following project types:\nC++ projects\nUnity projects\nUnreal Engine projects\nMono projects\n.NET Framework projects (without heap information)\n\n\n\n\nFor newly supported project types, the Monitoring functionality is currently limited to the Chart and Environment tabs. The Chart tab in these cases only includes data on CPU usage and private memory consumption.\nThe Counters tab, as well as detailed information on heap sizes, GC time, and exception counts in the Charts tab, are still only supported .NET Core 3.0+ and .NET 5+ applications.\nPlease note some known cases where this feature might not work: \nwhen cmd.exe is monitored instead of the user’s application if the Use external console option is enabled in configuration settings on Windows \nwhen attaching to mono processes\nPerformance and memory profiling\ndotTrace \nWe’ve resolved the issue with missing kernel sampling events in Timeline mode (DTRC-30949).\ndotMemory\nThe built-in dotMemory plugin has gained the ability to automatically analyze snapshots and compare snapshots contained in different dotMemory workspaces. This entails the introduction of a couple of additional views:\nAutomatic memory inspections: dotMemory gets the Inspections view, which shows a number of automatically detected memory issues.\nCross-workspace snapshot comparison: Now, you can compare snapshots from different profiling sessions, allowing for a more comprehensive memory analysis.\nThese features are available in the standalone version of dotMemory.\nExplain with AI for Dynamic Program Analysis \nThe Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA) tool window now features an Explain with AI button for issues related to memory allocation and database problems. This AI-driven feature offers detailed explanations and advice from AI Assistant on potential fixes directly within the Dynamic Program Analysis tool window to help you quickly understand and resolve even the most complex issues associated with memory allocation and working with databases. \nGame development\n[Godot] Debugging for GDScript\nRider 2024.2 EAP 5 introduces support for debugging GDScript in Godot. This update makes it easier for Godot developers to debug their scripts directly within Rider, streamlining the development process and providing a more integrated experience.\nFor the full list of changes included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.\nDownload the EAP build \n                                                    \nWe encourage you to download the latest build, explore these new features, and share your feedback with us.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hi everyone!\nWe’re back with an update on the state of the RubyMine 2024.2 Early Access Program. In preparation for the release, we’ve been working on improving AI Assistant, as well as providing support for Rails 8 features, Stimulus, and more.\nYou can download the latest EAP build from our website, via the free Toolbox App, or by using snaps for Ubuntu.\nAI features\nFor version 2024.2, our focus is on improving AI Assistant completion. With this in mind, we enhanced AI Assistant to make it work better with Ruby- and Rails-specific contexts.\nFor multiline code completion, we’ve upgraded the existing prompts to request specific technological details, including the Ruby version in use, if it is a Rails or Gem project, the test framework in use, the name of the current file, and the five most popular gems in the project.\nMoreover, the AI Assistant completion feature can now be activated at the end of lines that have content, meaning it works after statements following a . (as in str.<caret>) and ::, or after binary expressions.\nWe also improved how AI Assistant works with the context of Rails applications. For example, when requesting code explanation on a controller, AI Assistant now takes into account the corresponding model and routes.\nRails\nCompletion in Kamal configuration files\nRubyMine now provides code completion for Kamal configuration files. When editing deploy.yaml and .env files, you’ll see completion suggestions for the Kamal-specific properties.\n\n\n\n\nCode insight for rate limiting\nRails 8 introduces the rate_limit function for use with controllers. To take advantage of this new feature, we implemented code insight for rate limiting, including code highlighting and completion.\nCode insight for browser guards\nAnother feature coming in RubyMine 2024.2 is code insight for the browser guard method. We added highlighting for the allow_browser function, as well as completion for browser names and only arguments.\nStimulus\nRubyMine 2024.2 now includes built-in support for Stimulus, a JavaScript framework that integrates with static HTML and current DOM elements. The Stimulus plugin is bundled with RubyMine and works in .erb files. The stimulus-rails gem is shipped by default with Rails starting from version 7.\nRubyMine offers a range of features to facilitate working with Stimulus, including code completion, navigation, and rename refactorings.\nKeep an eye out for upcoming blog posts that will guide you how to effectively use Stimulus in RubyMine.\nOther features\nCompletion for Ruby-related commands in the new terminal\nThe new terminal provides automatic completion for commands, options, subcommands, arguments, and more. In RubyMine 2024.2, we added completion for the following commands: ruby, rails, rake, bundle, rbenv, irb, pry, rbs, and rspec.\n\n\n\n\nAs we continue enhancing completion for CLI commands, certain completion options may not be accessible or may differ from shell-based completion.\nMarkdown rendering in Reader mode and quick documentation\nAs Rails 8 uses Markdown documentation instead of RDoc, we implemented Markdown rendering, making it available in Reader mode and quick documentation popups. The functionality will work if a file has the :markup: markdown directive at the beginning or if there’s an .rdoc_options file in the project root with the line markup: markdown in it.\nCustom RuboCop configurations\nIn this release, we introduced a new option to select a custom configuration file for RuboCop, available in Settings | Tools | RuboCop. RubyMine passes the path to your configuration file as a RuboCop command argument with the --config option, which ensures it works even when a remote SDK is used.\nIf you don’t specify any file, RubyMine will use either .rubocop.yaml or the default settings if the former is not found in your project.\nFormatter settings\nWe implemented a new formatter setting in RubyMine to control spaces inside array literals. The setting aligns with the behavior of RuboCop and can be accessed from Settings | Editor | Code Style | Ruby | Spaces | Within array literals.\nJoin the Early Access Program\nYou can download the latest EAP build from our website or via the Toolbox App. The full list of closed tickets for this EAP build is available in the release notes. \nWe encourage you to share your thoughts in the comments below and to create and vote for new feature requests in the issue tracker.\nHappy developing!\nThe RubyMine team",

They provide a structured approach to learning by breaking extensive programming projects into smaller, more manageable tasks.\nUpdated New Course window\nWe’ve updated the New Course dialog window to simplify the setup process for educators. Now, when starting to create a new course, educators first select the course name and description.\n\n\n\n\nIn the second step, they are prompted to choose the type of their first lesson: Simple Lesson or Guided Project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced sync features\nNow, course creators can ensure that all necessary files are present in a task, even if changes are made during the project. This is particularly beneficial for educators who need to add missing code or refine specific tasks.\nAdding missing code:\nScenario: An essential line of code was missed in Task 3 that impacts future tasks.\nSolution: The editor notification will prompt you to sync this change with the following tasks, ensuring consistency.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s how you can synchronize changes within Guided Projects in a single task file, all changes within a task, and all changes in all tasks depending on your needs:\nEditor notification: When you change a task, an editor notification will ask if you want to sync the changes with the next task, making it easy to propagate updates through subsequent tasks. \nIf you choose Sync changes…, the updates will apply to the following task. If you select Ignore, no further changes will be tracked for that specific file in the current task.\n\n\n\n\nHelp tooltip: Hovering over a file in the project view will now display a tooltip that notifies you of unsynced changes, keeping you informed of files that need attention.\n\n\n\n\nContext menu: You can also sync files from the context menu using the Sync File with Next Tasks… option.\n\nThese enhancements aim to improve your experience with Guided Projects, offering better control and clarity when updating your educational content. \nCheck out these Marketplace courses to see how Guided projects work:\nKotlin Onboarding: Introduction\nKotlin Onboarding: Object-Oriented Programming\nKotlin Onboarding: Collections\nC+​+ ​Basics\nPython Libraries – NumPy\nIntroduction to IDE Code Refactoring in Kotlin\nIntroduction to IDE Code Refactoring in Java\nMachine Learning 101\nReinforcement Learning Maze Solver\n\n\n\n\nFor the full list of issues addressed in the JetBrains Academy plugin 2024.5 update, see our issue tracker.\nWe hope you enjoy this release, and as always, please share your feedback with us in the comments section below and use our issue tracker to report any issues or bugs you encounter.\nThe JetBrains Academy team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At //Build 2024, the WinUI team announced a renewed focus on WinUI as one of the premier app development frameworks we recommend for native Windows app development. To make it as seamless and easy as possible to get into coding, we created a new Windows Dev Center page, streamlined our Getting Started with WinUI documentation, and partnered with Visual Studio to improve the developer experience with workloads and templates. Today, we’ll focus on showing you the great new changes in Visual Studio along with a little bit of our thought process behind them and links to learn more!\n\nGetting started with the new workload\nIn Visual Studio 17.10, the new “Windows application development” workload is now available for developers to jump right in and get started with writing stylish, modern, and fast WinUI apps using .NET or C++ with only one click. This workload replaces the older “Universal Windows Platform development” workload with tools aimed at the latest generation of WinUI + the Windows App SDK. WinUI templates have also been given a fresh new icon and priority boost in the New Project template list, and they now include a new community-requested Unit Test template to help test WinUI apps more easily!\nTo get started with the new workload, follow these easy steps:\nOpen the Visual Studio Installer.\nUnder Workloads > Desktop & Mobile, select the “Windows application development” workload.\n\nIf you’re developing in C#, congrats, you’re finished! The workload includes .NET WinUI app development tools by default.\nIf you’d like to develop in C++ or if you need the tools for Universal Windows Development, select the optional “C++ WinUI app development tools” component. This will automatically select the Universal Windows Platform tools and C++ Universal Windows Platform tools components.\n\nThat’s it! In previous versions of Visual Studio, to develop with WinUI + the Windows App SDK you had to manually search for each required component in the list of optional components – and this was after reading the docs to find out what you needed! We also heard feedback that WinUI in the Windows App SDK, which represents the latest generation of WinUI that succeeds the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), was less prominent than its predecessor. With the new workload and components, we’ve addressed this feedback to make the newest tools and APIs clear, front-and-center, and available with one click!\nTake advantage of WinUI template improvements\nOnce you have the “Windows application development” workload installed, now it’s time to start creating projects. We got some great feedback here on the New Project screen as well – the WinUI templates were far down the list, which made them seem less important than other templates, and they needed a fresh coat of paint. We heard you, so we bumped the most-used WinUI templates closer to the top and added a sparkly new icon!\nGo to File > New Project to see these updates in action!\n\nThe rest of the templates aren’t much farther down, either; on most monitors, you probably won’t need to scroll to see them. In that list is one more addition we’d love to highlight – the new Unit Test template for WinUI! This was directly requested by you, the WinUI developer community, and we’re thrilled to introduce it alongside our other improvements to the WinUI workload and template experience.\nConclusion\nWe wanted to thank you again for all your for you. You’re helping to make it easier for new WinUI developers to embrace native app development on Windows and helping us produce the best native app development experience on Windows that we can.\nTo give us feedback on the platform directly, visit us on GitHub, or follow us on Twitter to stay up to date on releases and news.\nTo learn more about WinUI and for more info on getting started, check out our new Windows Dev Center page at https://aka.ms/windev.\nIf you’re interested in the full picture of what we talked about at //Build 2024 beyond our Visual Studio updates, check out these two sessions:\nNavigating Win32 App Development with WinUI and WPF | BRK241 (youtube.com)\nHow to create superior experiences with WinUI and WPF | BRK244 (youtube.com)\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. Your feedback is critical to help us make Visual Studio the best tool it can be! You can share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn.\nThe post Dive into native Windows development with new WinUI workload and template improvements appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

(AMD의 미니PC용 CPU는 십자리숫자가 세대를 의미한다. 따라서 7735 는 3세대, 7740은 4세대이다)\n24년 3월에 구입해서 4월초부터 사용해서 현재까지 약 2개월 정도 사용했고 그에 따라서 리뷰를 남긴다.\n \n1. 제품 스펙 및 특징\n제품명\nFirebat MN56\n\n\nCPU\nAMD Ryzen 7840HS [1]\n3.8GHz, 8 core, 16MB cache, Memory(DDR5 5600Mhz)\n\n\nRAM\n16GB  = 8GB (DDR5, 5600MHz) x2 \n= 램이 약간 부족한 듯 싶어서 따로 삼성 DDR5 16GB를 2개 구입해서 업그레이드 했다.\n\n\nSSD\nNVMe 512GB (양쯔 메모리)\n\n\nNetwork (Wired)\nintel i226 (2.5Ghz)\nRealtek RTL8111H (1Gbps)\n\n\nNetwork (Wireless)\nIntel AX200\n- WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3\n\n\nUSB\nUSB-C (USB4 40Gbps, DP-Alt 디스플레이 지원) x1\nUSB-A 3.2 Gen2 (10Gbps) x2 (전면)\nUSB-A 2.0 x2 (후면)\n\n\n디스플레이\nHDMI 2.1 (4K 60Hz) x1 \nDP 1.4  (4K 60Hz) x1\n\n\nAudio\nRealtek audio\n마이크, 헤드폰 겸용 3극 단자 지원\n\n\nPower\n20V/5A DC 어댑터\n\n\nPrice\n$300 초반 (세금 포함)\n\n\n\nFirebat MN56에서 제공하는 전후면 인터페이스는 아래 그림을 보면 쉽게 이해할 수 있다.\nFirebat mn56 7840HS - 후면(위), 전면(아래)\n\n\n위 사진에서 제품의 후면 및 전면 단자를 순서대로 적으면 아래와 같다.\n후면 단자 \n(왼쪽부터)\n전원(20V, 5A), 2.5G LAN (i226-v), 1G LAN(Realtek), DP 1.4, HDMI 2.1, USB 2.0 2개\n\n\n전면 단자\n(왼쪽부터)\n전원 버튼, 헤드폰 3극 단자, USB 3.2 Gen2 (10Gbps) 2개, USB4 (DP-alt, PD지원), LED 버튼\n\n\n\n후면의 USB-C 단자는 DC 전원 전용이므로 USB4나 TB4(썬더볼트4) 단자를 꼽으면 부팅하다가 그냥 꺼진다. 실제로 100W를 지원하는 썬더볼트4 독을 연결해봤는데 전원이 잠깐 들어왔다가 바로 꺼졌다.\n원래 시스템에서 USB4 포트를 2개까지 지원하는데 1개만 만들어 둔 것은 좀 아쉽다고 생각한다. 만일 2개를 지원했다면 USB 허브 연결과 USB-C 외장 모니터까지 바로 연결할 수 있을텐데 말이다.\n전원 버튼이 매우 민감해서 헤드폰 잭이나 USB 단자를 꼽다가 눌러서 꺼트린 적이 있었다. 이건 좀 주의해야 할 듯 싶다.\n \n2. 내부 구조\n뒷판은 나사를 빼면 들어낼 수 있다. 딱히 조심해야 할 것은 없다. 뒷판은 VESA 홀 규격을 지원하고 있다.\nFirebat MN56 7840HS 뒷판 내부\n\n\n램은 삼성 DDR5 5600으로 장착되어있고, SSD는 NVMe 양쯔 메모리 제품인 듯 싶다. 디램리스로 보인다. NVMe를 들어내면 아랫쪽에 intel AX200NGW 무선 모듈이 존재한다. 무선 모듈과 NVMe SSD와 간격이 너무 좁아서 NVMe에 양면 방열판은 사용이 불가하다.\nFirebat MN56 7840HS 무선 모듈 intel AX200\n\n\nCMOD clear 점퍼는 NVMe 슬롯 바로 근처에 빨간색 점퍼로 되어있다. 혹시라도 CMOS 설정을 잘못해서 부팅이 잘 안되면 클리어쪽으로 점퍼를 바꾸고 재부팅하면 된다. 물론 재부팅 후에는 다시 원상복구를 해야 한다.\nFirebat MN56 7840HS - CMOS clear jumper\n\n\n참고로 메인보드의 바이오스는 AMI를 사용하며, 설정할 수 있는 것은 별로 없으며, 전원 설정을 BALANCED, QUIET, PERFORMANCE 정도로 설정할 수 있는 정도만 만질 수 있다. 오버 기능도 있긴 한데, 가뜩이나 발열도 못잡는데 오버하면 CPU나 메인보드가 죽을 수도 있다고 생각된다.\n시스템에 대한 자세한 정보는 CPU-Z로 확인해보면 다음과 같이 살펴볼 수 있다.\nAMD 7840HS - CPU-Z\n\nFirebat MN56 mainboard, BIOS, PCIe\n\n\n \n \n3. 발열 및 팬 소음\n전원 정책(power control policy)를 balanced로 두는 경우 유튜브나 음악을 틀어놓고, 구글 문서 작업을 할 경우 CPU 사용량은 10~20%이내를 유지했고, 온도도 매우 착했다. 아래 그림에서 볼 수 있듯이 평상시 온도는 CPU의 경우 40도 내외였고, 간혹 갑자기 로드가 치솟을 때도 70도를 넘지 않았다. CPU의 내장 그래픽인 GPU 코어의 경우 35~43도 정도로 매우 착했다. 그리고 삼성 DDR5 램의 경우 평상시에도 CPU보다 약간 더 높은 온도로서 약 45도 정도를 유지했다.\nFirebat MN56 7840HS - CPU, GPU, RAM temperature\n\n\n다만 게임을 실행하면 온도가 매우 높은 수준으로 올라갔다. 테스트용 게임으로는 GTA5를 실행했고, FHD 해상도에 60Hz 중옵으로도 최하 70에서 80도 중반 이상까지 올라갔다. 심각할 정도로 열이 높았다.\n특히 DDR5 램도 엄청나게 뜨거워서 75도를 왔다갔다 했다. 아래는 열화상 카메라로 찍은 사진이다. 원래 DDR5가 발열이 있긴 한데, 노트북용 램은 더 뜨거운것 같다. 아마도 겹쳐있어서 그런 것이 아닐까 싶다. 나중에 얇은 구리형 노트북용 램 방열판을 붙여봤는데 전혀 효과가 없었다. 혹시라도 램 방열판을 붙이실 분들은 그냥 하지 마시라고 권해드리고 싶다.\nFirebat MN56 7840HS - temperature (game playing)\n\n\n특히 위 그림에 표시된 특정 부분이 뜨거웠다. 살펴보니 LR15 칩은 Vrms로 전원칩이고, 그 아래에 있는 JWH7030도 같은 전원쪽 칩셋인거 같은데, 특이하게 총 5개의 칩셋 중에 왼쪽의 2개만 뜨겁고 나머지는 미지근하다. 전원 칩셋 중에 2개만 열심히 일하는 것 같다. 그래서 라즈베리파이에 붙이는 용도로 샀던 방열판을 LR15에 붙여봤는데, 큰 효과는 없었다. 게다가 JWH7030은 너무 작아서 붙일 수 있는 방열판이 없었다.\nFirebat MN56 - LR15, JWH7030 Vrms\n\n\n \nFirebat에서 뭔가 뒷판을 냉각할 수 있는 애드온 쿨러를 만들던지 해야지 이거 너무 뜨거워서 문제일 듯 싶다. 실제로 지금은 그냥 뒷판 따고 거기에 노트북 쿨러용 팬을 거치해서 쓰고 있다.\n \n4. 소프트웨어 드라이버\nn100의 경우 드라이버가 제대로 구비되지 않아서 좀 고생을 했는데, Firebat MN56 7840HS 제품은 거의 표준 드라이버를 사용해서 따로 드라이버를 백업 받을 필요가 없었다. 해당 제품은 AMD에서 종합 드라이버, 인텔 무선 드라이버를 다운로드해서 설치하면 끝이었다.[2] 나머지는 윈도우 기본 드라이버로 모두 인식되었다.\n특히 i226-v 2.5Gbps LAN의 경우 드라이버를 다운로드 하는 방법과, 속도 저하 및 끊김 등의 문제가 생길 수 있으므로 이 글 아래에 있는 링크를 참고하기 바란다.\n \n리눅스에서는 따로 드라이버를 설치해줄 필요가 없었다. Fedora 40 설치시 아무런 문제없이 잘 설치되었다. 현재는 윈도11, 리눅스를 듀얼 부팅으로 사용하고 있다.\n참고로 미니 PC의 경우 기본으로 탑재되어있는 윈도우가 해킹 프로그램이 설치되어있는 경우도 있다고 하니, 그냥 밀어버리고 새롭게 설치하는 것이 좋다. 그런데 표준 드라이버를 사용하지 않는 경우에는 호환성에 문제가 있어서 드라이버를 미리 백업받는 것을 권장하지만, 이 제품(Firebat MN56)처럼 표준 드라이버를 사용하는 경우에는 그냥 포맷해도 문제가 없다.\n \n5. 총평\n전체적으로 발열이 문제인 것을 제외하면 호환성이나 관련 문제는 없었다. 이 제품은 장단점은 아래와 같다.\n장점\n윗면에 대형 플라워 팬을 사용해서 소음이 적다.\nAMD나 intel의 표준 하드웨어 드라이버를 사용하므로 소프트웨어 호환성 걱정이 없다.\nUSB4를 지원하므로 USB-C로 모니터 출력이나 혹은 썬더볼트 독을 연결하면 엄청난 확장을 할 수 있다.\n평상시에는 10W 수준으로 적은 전력을 소비하는 장점이 있다.\n\n\n단점\n게임 실행시 발열이 엄청나게 발생한다. 뒷판을 열어서 식히지 않으면 장기적인 사용에서 문제가 될 가능성이 있다고 생각된다. \n다만 일반 오피스 사용이나 유튜브 시청 정도로는 발열이 거의 없다.\n\n\n\n이 제품은 게임 실행시 발열이 심했기에 따로 냉각하지 않으면 고장날지도 모른다는 생각이 들었다. 솔직히 80~90도에 가까운 발열을 제품이 계속 버틸 수 있을까 의문이다. 하지만 리눅스 서버로 사용하면 게임 실행시와 달리 발열도 없으므로 꽤 괜찮다고 생각한다.\n \n레퍼런스\n[1] AMD 7840hs spec. https://www.amd.com/ko/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/7000-series/amd-ryzen-7-7840hs.html\n[2] i225-v, i226-v 드라이버 설치 및 끊김 문제 설정, https://sunyzero.tistory.com/276\n \n히스토리\n20240630 초안",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "지열 에너지와 리튬을 동시에 추출 가능한 미국의 호수 “Salton Sea(솔턴 시)“를 기반으로 회사를 운영하는 보드게임.\n\n\n\n\n캘리포니아의 유명 휴양지 팜스프링스 동쪽으로 100km쯤 떨어져 있는 내륙 염수 호수 Salton Sea. 면적이 서울의 1.3배 크기인 889 km² 정도인데, 해수면보다 고도가 낮고 최고 수심이 13m 밖에 되지 않는다. \nSalton Sea from Wikipedia\n\n\n\n1905년 콜로라도 강의 범람으로 인해 우연히 형성된 이 호수는 염도가 44g/L로 태평양(35g/L)보다 짜고, 내륙에 있어서 매년 더 농도가 증가하고 있다. 한때 휴양지로 인기가 많았으나 농업 활동으로 인한 비료/농약 유입, 물공급 감소, 고온으로 염분이 증가하다가 90년대에는 물고기가 대규모로 폐사하는 등 생태계에 큰 피해를 주었다. 현재 Salton Sea는 환경 재앙의 상징으로 여겨지며, 생태계 복원과 환경 보호를 위한 노력이 진행 중인 곳인데 왜 여기를 기반으로 보드게임을 만들었을까? ( 이 내용들 중 일부는 매뉴얼 초반에 설명되어 있는 것임)\n재생 에너지를 이야기할 때 태양광/풍력이 주로 이야기 되지만, 요즘엔 지열 에너지(Geothermal energy)도 각광을 받기 시작하고 있다. \nfrom 미국 EPA(Environmental Protection Agency)\n지표 근처의 700~1200도에 달하는 마그마로 가열된 암석을 통해 끓어오른 지하수를 퍼올려 수증기 터빈을 통해 발전을 시키고, 온도가 낮아져 액체로 돌아가면 다시 지하로 주입해서 암석에 재가열시키는 순환이 가능하다. 지열 에너지의 장점은 태양광/풍력과 달리 24시간, 1년 내내 일정하게 전력 추출이 된다. 단점은 지구상에서 이렇게 고온을 가진 지점에 접근 가능한 장소가 희소하다는 것. 그래서 많은 나라들이 태양광/풍력을 주 재생 에너지원으로 선택한다.\n그러나 밤에는 태양이 뜨지않고, 바람이 불지 않을 때도 있으니 전기를 저장해둬야 한다. 현 시점에서 전력 저장에 가장 효율적인 것은 리튬 배터리를 이용하는 것. 전기차 덕분에 유명해져 버린 리튬은 에너지 순환의 중추적 요소. 리튬은 매우 흔한 원소이고, 지구상에 풍부하게 존재하지만 최근까지는 수요가 많지 않다가 갑자기 수요가 폭증하면서 광산이 부족해 져서 리튬 가격이 폭등하기도 했다.\n리튬을 가장 많이 함유하고 있는 곳은 바다이고, 물에 용해 되어 있다. 하지만 바다에 있는 리튬은 과하게 희석 되어있고 많은 양을 증발시켜 처리해야 하므로 수율이 좋지 않다. 그래서 요즘은 바다보다 염분이 높은 염수 기반으로 리튬을 얻는 메커니즘도 활용되고 있다. 물은 온도가 높을 수록 더 많은 염분을 용해시키는데, 앞서 말한 뜨거운 지하수를 퍼올려서 열과 함께 리튬도 추출이 가능한데, 물이 뜨거워질수록 리터당 추출할 수 있는 리튬이 양의 늘어난다. 즉 지열 발전소는 지구 내부의 열을 이용해 전력을 생산하며, 동시에 리튬의 잠재적인 공급원도 될 수 있다.\n솔턴 시는 이 모든 것이 어우러진 곳이다. 캘리포니아 지진의 원인인 산 안드레아스 단층의 끝자락에 붙어 있어서 화산과 지열 활동이 나타난다. 이 지열 활동이 활발한 지역을 시추해서 수증기와 뜨거운 물을 얻을수 있는데, 수증기로는 발전을 시키고, 뜨거운 물은 염수이므로 리튬을 추출해서 동시에 판매가 가능해 진다. 전력 생산과 저장을 동시에 하는 회사가 만들어질수 있다는 이야기.\n그래서 이제 실제 Salton Sea 보드게임 이야기로 들어가보면..\n각 플레이어는 염수를 퍼내어서 지열/리튬을 추출하는 기업의 대표고, 회사를 잘 경영해서 최고의 승점을 얻는 사람이 이기는 전형적인 일꾼 놓기에 약간의 덱빌딩을 섞은 전략게임.\n\n\n\n\n엔지니어 4명을 가지고 시작하여 회사가 발전하면서 총 7명까지 늘어나게 되는데, 엔지니어들로 할 수 있는 액션은 3개의 분야로 나눠진다.\n산업 행동 : 굴착 허가 획득하기, 드릴로 시추하기, 염수 추출하기, 리튬/지열에너지로 가공하기, 드릴과 공장 수리하기\n상업 행동 : 리튬/전력 판매하기, 계약 체결하기, 계약 수행하기\n경영 행동 : 연구, 주식 매입, 사업프로젝트 진행(회사 발전), 재정 지원 받기\n\n\n\n\n$1, $3, $5 로 가격이 매겨진 액션덱을 돈으로 쓰다보니 어떤 걸 돈으로 내고, 어떤걸 유지해서 액션으로 써야할지 미친듯이 고민하게 만드는 게임.\n굴착 허가 획득에서는 소유지 카드를 가져와서 차례대로 쌓게 되는데, 소유지 카드별로 염수/암반 등이 다르게 그려져 있음. 드릴로 시추할때 암반이 있으면 드릴의 내구도가 떨어지게 되고, 나중에 적절하게 수리하지 않으면 시추 행동을 하지 못할 수 있음. 드릴로 시추해서 염수가 있는 곳까지 파고 들어가면 염수 추출이 가능. 추출한 염수를 창고에 저장했다가 리튬/지열에너지로 가공하게 되는데 이를 위해서는 창고도 처음엔 두칸만 주고, 점차 확장해 나가야 함.\n리튬/전력을 만들고 판매하는 메커니즘이 조금 독특한데, 염수에서 리튬/전력을 만들때 기본 비용이 발생하므로 내 액션 카드를 금액으로 내서 써야함. 매입하는 회사별로 금액이 다르고 금액이 결정되면 현재 시장에 깔린 행동 카드를 금액에 맞게 골라서 가져오는 방식인데, 액션카드가 $1, $3, $5로 세가지인데 좋은 액션을 위해서는 비싼 카드로 받아야 하지만, 그러면 액션의 선택 범위가 줄어들어 버려서 어떤 카드를 돈으로 써서 다음 액션을 준비할 지가 엄청난 고민. 단순 판매가 아니라 계약을 체결하고 수행하면 돈과 승점, 주식, 사업 발전등의 혜택을 주기 때문에 이것도 승리를 위해서는 신경 써야 함.\n\n\n\n\n연구를 통해서는 기본으로 하는 동작들을 강화 가능. 염수나 리튬을 더 추출한다거나, 굴착 허가 받을때나 수리할때마다 할인해준다거나 하는 등. 그리고 이렇게 번 돈을 가지고, 우리가 리튬/전력을 사가는 회사의 주식을 구매해서 미래를 내다보는 재투자 전략이 녹아있다는게 놀라움. 우리꺼 사가서 니네 회사 잘나가면 나도 좋아!\n\n\n\n\nBGG 기준 난이도 3.74로 카네기와 거의 비슷한데, 미래 지향적인 테마가 너무 잘 녹아 있어서 칭찬하고 싶은 게임. 심지어 카네기의 1/4 사이즈로 박스도 작다. 한글판이 나오지 않았지만 보드게임 자체는 모두 아이콘이라 룰만 익히면 충분히 게임이 가능하다. 박스에 120분이라고 씌여 있는데, 액션 선택하기가 어려워서 첫플에 설명시간 포함해서 4시간 정도 걸린듯\nSaltonSea #보드게임 #솔턴시\nThe post 보드게임 리뷰: Salton Sea – “이런 걸 게임으로 만들었다고?” first appeared on Guru's Blog.",

        "content": "\n            \n            &lt;p&gt;ZGC(Z Garbage Collector)는 JVM 진영에서 Serial → Parallel → CMS → G1 이후에 새롭게 등장한 Garbage Collector 입니다. JDK 11에 Experimental로 추가되었고, JDK 15에서 Production Ready 상태로 전환되었으며, LDT 버전인 JDK 17에도 반영되었습니다. ZGC의 주요 목표 중 하나는 Stop-The-World(STW) 시간을 1ms 이하로 줄이는 것입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;과거에 CMS GC를 사용하는 애플리케이션을 운영하다보면 STW 시간이 길어지다 보면 요청을 제대로 처리하지 못하는 현상 때문에 애를 먹었던게 생각나네요. ZGC는 대용량 힙 메모리에서도 낮은 지연 시간(low latency)을 목표로 설계되었기 때문에, 이를 적용하는 것만으로도 충분한 가치가 있어보이는 GC 알고리즘이었습니다. 이번 글에서는 애플리케이션의 성능을 개선하면서 적용했던 ZGC에 대해 소개하려고 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;zgc&quot;&gt;ZGC&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZGC는 대용량 힙 메모리에서도 낮은 지연 시간(low latency)을 목표로 설계되었습니다. Heap Allocation, Compaction 등 거의 모든 면에서 변화가 있었기 때문에, 꼭 바로 이전에 나온 G1과 비교하지 않더라도 ZGC 자체로도 재미있는 피쳐들을 가지고 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;아래는 2023년 Oracle DevLive Level Up에서 발표된 &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/OnodHoNYE1Y?si=dtTtNzjkC-KK5ZIt&quot;&gt;Z Garbage Collector: The Next Generation&lt;/a&gt;에 소개된 ZGC의 특징들입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable&lt;/strong&gt;: 확장 가능하도록 설계되어 수백 MB에서 최대 수 TB 메모리 처리&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low Latency&lt;/strong&gt;: 1MS 미만의 일정한 STW 시간(puase-time)&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto-tuning&lt;/strong&gt;: 성능 최적화에 필요한 튜닝의 양을 줄이기기 위해 GC의 많은 튜닝 설정들을 자동화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughput&lt;/strong&gt;: 동일한 워크로드에서 전체 성능의 15% 내에서 성능 유지&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-00.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC&quot; title=&quot;ZGC&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC&quot; title=&quot;ZGC&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concurrent&lt;/strong&gt;:  ZGC는 대부분의 작업을 Java 애플리케이션 스레드가 실행되는 동안 동시에 수행. GC 동안 애플리케이션의 응답성을 유지하는 데 도움을 준다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constant pause times&lt;/strong&gt;:  GC 동안 발생하는 STW(pause-time)이 일정하게 유지되며, 힙 크기나 라이브 객체의 크기에 따라 비례적으로 증가하지 않는다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parallel&lt;/strong&gt;:  여러 스레드를 동시에 사용하여 GC 수행해서 더 빠르게 완료. Reference 할당마다 실행되는 Load Barrier를 통해 GC에 필요한 작업들을 멀티 스레드로 애플리케이션 스레드와 동시에 진행.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compacting&lt;/strong&gt;:  메모리 단편화를 줄이기 위해 객체를 이동시켜서 메모리 할당 효율성을 높인다.\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;G1GC는 Compaction을 STW 동안 수행하는 반면, ZGC는 애플리케이션 스레드와 병렬로 수행.&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;즉, 객체 이동 및 업데이트 작업을 애플리케이션이 실행되는 동안 동시에 수행한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Region-based&lt;/strong&gt;:  메모리를 여러 영역으로 나누어 관리하며, 많은 가비지가 생성되는 영역에 집중하여 효율적으로 GC 수행&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NUMA-aware&lt;/strong&gt;:  NUMA(Non-Uniform Memory Access) 아키텍처를 인식하고, CPU에 가까운 메모리에 객체를 할당하여 성능을 최적화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load barriers &amp;amp; Colored pointers&lt;/strong&gt;:\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load barriers&lt;/strong&gt;:  메모리 로드 시 특정 조건을 확인하는 메커니즘, G C중에도 안전한 메모리 접근을 보장&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colored pointers&lt;/strong&gt;:  포인터에 색상을 지정하여 객체의 상태를 추적하고, 이를 통해 GC 효율적 수행&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auto tuning&lt;/strong&gt;:  복잡한 설정 없이 자동으로 최적화되도록 설계되었다. 복잡한 설정을 조정할 필요 없이 ZGC의 혜택을 누릴 수 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC&quot; title=&quot;ZGC&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;heap-allocation&quot;&gt;Heap Allocation&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G1 GC(Garbage First Garbage Collector)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;G1GC는 Garbage Collection을 보다 효율적으로 수행하기 위해 Heap을 동일한 크기의 여러 힙 영역(Regions)으로 나눕니다. 그리고 각 Heap 영역은 서로 다른 역할을 담당합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Eden Space: 새로 생성된 객체들이 할당되는 공간.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Survivor Space: Eden 영역에서 생존한 객체들이 이동되는 공간.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Old Generation: Survivor 영역에서 생존한 오래된 객체들이 이동되는 공간.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/g1-heap-allocation.png&quot; alt=&quot;G1 Heap Allocation&quot; title=&quot;G1 Heap Allocation&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZGC는 메모리 단편화를 줄이고 관리 효율성을 높이기 위해 다양한 크기의 메모리 블록으로 Heap을 나누어 사용합니다. 마찬가지로 각 Heap 영역은 서로 다른 역할을 담당합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Small: 작은 객체들이 할당되는 영역.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Medium: 중간 크기 객체들이 할당되는 영역.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Large(N x 2 MB): 큰 객체들이 할당되는 영역. N은 객체 크기에 따라 달라집니다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-heap-allocation.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Heap Allocation&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Heap Allocation&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;zgc를-도입하며-발생하는-trade-off&quot;&gt;ZGC를 도입하며 발생하는 Trade-off&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZGC는 별도 설정 없이 자동으로 최적화까지 해주니 모든 면에서 우수해보입니다. 그런데 ZGC를 도입하며 발생할 수 있는 trade-off가 몇가지 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) CPU 자원 효율 문제&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZGC는 초당 1ms 이하의 pause time을 유지하면서도 최대 16TB 크기의 힙을 지원하는 것으로 설계되었습니다. 대부분의 작업을 Java 애플리케이션 스레드가 실행되는 동안 동시에 수행하기 때문에, 그만큼 CPU 자원을 사용하게 되고, 이는 &lt;strong&gt;애플리케이션의 처리량(Throughput) 감소에 영향&lt;/strong&gt;을 줄 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;특히 초기 ZGC(~JDK 21)는 단일 세대 ZGC(Single-generational ZGC 또는 Non-generational ZGC)라고도 부르는데, 이제 막 생성된 객체와 오래된 객체 간의 구분이 따로 없어서 단일 세대라고 부릅니다. 그러다보니 GC 수행 과정에서 모든 객체를 대상으로 정리가 발생하기 때문에, CPU 활용 효율면에서는 조금은 더 취약합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) 객체 할당 지연(Allocation stall) 문제(← 1번으로 인해 발생)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;새로운 객체가 메모리에 할당되는 속도가 GC가 메모리를 회수하는 속도보다 빠를 때 할당 지연(Allocation stall) 문제가 발생합니다. 이건 메모리가 부족하기 때문에 발생하는데, GC가 메모리를 회수하는 동안 애플리케이션은 새로운 객체를 할당하기 위해 기다려야되고, 이로 인해 애플리케이션의 성능이 저하될 수 있습니다. 이건 1번으로 인한 부수 효과인데, 전체 힙 대상으로 한 번에 GC를 수행하기 때문에 처리가 오래 걸리기 때문입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;generational-zgc&quot;&gt;Generational ZGC&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그래서 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 JDK 21에 Generational ZGC이 등장했습니다. ZGC와 동일한데 Heap을 논리적으로 두 세대로 분리한 차이가 있습니다(Young, Old). 객체가 할당되면 먼저 자주 스캔되는 Young Generation에 배치되고, 객체가 충분히 오래 살아남으면 Old Generation으로 승격됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;처리량 측면에서, Generational ZGC는 JDK 17의 단일 세대 ZGC 대비 약 10%의 개선을 보였으며, 약간의 저하가 있었던 JDK 21의 단일 세대 ZGC 대비 약 10% 이상의 성능 향상을 보였다고 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-young-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Young &amp;amp; Old&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Young &amp;amp; Old&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;주요-차이점&quot;&gt;주요 차이점&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-vs-generational-zgc.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC vs. Generational ZGC&quot; title=&quot;ZGC vs. Generational ZGC&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;performances&quot;&gt;Performances&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;단일 세대와의 성능 차이는 &lt;a href=&quot;https://inside.java/2023/11/28/gen-zgc-explainer/&quot;&gt;Introducing Generational ZGC&lt;/a&gt;에 잘 소개되어 있으니 참고하시면 좋겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-performance-00.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-performance-01.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-performance-02.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2024/06/29/zgc-performance-03.png&quot; alt=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; title=&quot;ZGC Performance&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;generational-zgc-활성화&quot;&gt;Generational ZGC 활성화&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Generational ZGC를 활성화하려면 ZGC 사용을 위한 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-XX:+UseZGC&lt;/code&gt; 옵션에 더해 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-XX:+ZGenerational&lt;/code&gt; argument도 추가해줘야 합니다(JDK 버전은 21 이상).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;참고로, JDK 21에서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-XX:+ZGenerational&lt;/code&gt; 옵션이 없으면 Single-generation ZGC가 기본값입니다. 따라서 이 옵션을 추가하지 않으면 단일 세대의 ZGC가 동작합니다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;미래에는 Generational ZGC가 기본값이 될 예정이라고 합니다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;jvm-메모리-할당량이-커보이는-현상&quot;&gt;JVM 메모리 할당량이 커보이는 현상&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ZGC 적용 이후에 메트릭을 살펴보면 선언한 Max Heap Size 보다 더 큰 메모리가 관측됩니다.

JVM 애플리케이션의 Max Heap Size를 3GB로 설정했는데, Grafana(export by prometheus)에서 관측된 메트릭은 2배 정도인 6GB가 관측되었습니다. 의도하지 않았는데 재밌는 현상입니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2024/06/29/zgc-heap-metric.png\" alt=\"ZGC JVM Heap\" title=\"ZGC JVM Heap\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<center>`jvm_memory_max_bytes`: The total memory (in bytes) in the JVM runtime.</center>\n\n<p><strong>1. 다중 매핑</strong>:<br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>ZGC는 동일한 주소(메모리)를 3개의 다른 view로 매핑: marked0, marked1, remapped</li>\n  <li>이 3개의 view는 virtual memory address에 반영되는데, 동일 물리 메모리를 3개의 다른 가상 메모리에 맵핑되는 형태. 즉, 각 물리 메모리 페이지에 3개의 가상 페이지가 맵핑됩니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>2. 가상 메모리 사용 증가:</strong><br /></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>이런 다중 매핑으로 인해 virtual memory 사용량이 실제 physical memory 사용량보다 크게 나타날 수 있어요.</li>\n  <li>예를 들어, 힙 사이즈가 1GB인 경우 virtual memory는 최대 3GB까지 관측될 수 있어요.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>3.

MZ 세대는 기성세대와는 다르게 트렌드에 상당히 민감하기 때문에, 이들에게 주목받고, 이들의 지갑을 열기 위해서는 지금까지의 영업/마케팅 방법을 과감하게 버리고, 완전히 새로운 방식으로, 그리고 이 새로운 방식조차 지속적으로 변형하면서 이들을 공략해야 한다는 내용이었다.\n우리도 다양한 사업, 그리고 다양한 사람들을 만난다. 창업가들의 나이는 점점 더 어려지고 있어서 우리가 만나는 많은 창업가들이 MZ 세대인데, 이들이 트렌드에 민감하고, 새로운 걸 좋아하고, 나 같은 세대의 사람들과는 모든 걸 다르게 보는 건 나도 잘 알고 있다. 하지만, 그렇다고 모든 회사가 이들의 취향에 모든 전략을 맞출 필요는 전혀 없다고 생각한다. 오히려 그렇게 하면 수십 년 동안 잘하던 사업의 기반이 흔들릴 것이라고 생각한다.\n일단 트렌드에 민감하다는 말을 조금 더 깊게 해석해 보면, 너무 유행을 탄다는 의미가 될 수도 있다. 유행을 타는 고객들은 브랜드에 대한 충성도가 없기 때문에, 이들에게 지속적으로 사랑받고 아주 오랜 기간 동안 꾸준하게 돈을 쓰게 만드는 게 힘들다. 트렌드를 세팅하고 리딩하는 세대일 수도 있지만, 어떻게 보면 사업의 확장에는 도움이 안 되는 대규모 뜨내기 세대가 될 수도 있다. 그리고 이 글의 오프닝에서 썼듯이, MZ 세대는 전반적으로 돈이 별로 없다. 소셜미디어상에서는 파급력이 강할진 몰라도, 막상 구매력이 그렇게 어마어마하진 않다.\n어떤 분들은 2년 반짝 사업을 성장시키고 적당한 가격에 팔고 빠질 목적으로 창업하지만, 내가 아는 대부분의 창업가들은 지속 가능한 사업을 만들고 있고, 지속 가능한 사업은 최소 10년이 걸린다. 이렇게 장기적인 안목으로 사업을 할 때, 반짝 유행하다가 없어질 것들과 지속적으로 유행해서 대세가 될 것들을 잘 구분해야 한다.\n유행과 대세를 어떻게 구분할까? 구분할 수 있는 방법은 없다. 그냥 장기적인 방향을 정하고, 이쪽으로 꾸준히 가는 수밖에 없다. 중간 중간에 여러 가지 트렌드와 새로운 유행이 생길 것인데, 그때마다 아무 생각 없이 남들이 가는 쪽으로 방향을 틀지 말고, 진지하게 고민해 보고 일시적인 유행이 아닌, 장기적인 대세가 될 수 있는 트렌드를 잘 선택하길 바란다.",

        "contentSnippet": "이전 포스트: 쿠버네티스 오퍼레이터를 Golang으로 개발해보기\n \n \n안녕하세요.\nCloud Strategy팀 박규민입니다.\n \n \n지난번에 Golang으로 쿠버네티스 오퍼레이터를 간단하게 만들어 봤습니다. 하지만 국내에서는 아무래도 Golang보다는 Java의 수요가 압도적으로 많은데요. 이번 포스트로 Java로 오퍼레이터를 구현하는 과정을 보여드리겠습니다.\n \n \nJava Operator SDK\n\n\nJava Operator SDK는 Kubernetes Client Java API인 fabric8io를 기반으로 작성되어 있습니다. 이는 세부적으로 쿠버네티스와 상호 작용하기 위한 Low Level 단에서의 코드 작성 걱정 없이 개발자에게 친숙한 Java API를 사용하여 오퍼레이터를 쉽게 작성할 수 있도록 설계되어 있습니다.\n \n \n \nArchitecture\n\n\nOperator는 Controller 클래스의 집합이며, Controller 클래스가 Kubernetes 단일 리소스를 조정(Reconciling)해주는 역할을 합니다.\nEventSourceManager가 Controller와 관련된 여러 EventSource들의 수명 주기를 관리해 줍니다. 여기에서의 Event는 리소스 조정을 유발하는 사건을 의미합니다.\n \nEventSource에서 EventProcessor에 전파되는 Event를 생성합니다. (Controller와 관련된 기본 리소스의 변경 사항을 감시할 때는 ControllerResourceEventSource를 통해 Event를 전파하여 관련 상태를 캐싱합니다) Event를 받은 EventProcessor에서 리소스가 아직 처리되지 않은 경우, 적절한 Reconciler 메소드로 호출하여 전달해 주는 ReconcilerDispatcher를 호출하여 필요한 모든 정보를 차례대로 전달합니다.\n \nReconciler 메소드가 끝났을 때 EventProcessor가 다시 호출되어 실행을 완료하고 Controller의 상태를 업데이트합니다. 그리고 Reconciler 메소드에서 반환한 결과에 따라서 필요한 경우, ReconcilerDispatcher는 Kubernetes API 서버에 호출합니다.\n마지막으로 EventProcessor는 요청 재시도를 해야 할지, 그리고 동일한 리소스에 대해 수신된 후속 Event가 없는지 확인합니다. 이 중 어느 것도 일어나지 않으면, Event 처리가 완료됩니다.\n \n \n직접 구현해야 할 포인트는?\n개발자들에게는 다음과 같은 구성 요소들을 Java Class로 만들 필요가 있습니다.\nPrimary Resource: k8s 클러스터에 배포할 CRD\nSpec, Status: CRD에 필요한 내부 구성 요소\n\nSpec: 사용자가 CR에 적용할 상태 정의\nStatus: CR의 현재 상태\nReconciler: Primary Resource의 변경사항을 감지하고 조정\nKubernetesDependentResource: CRD 배포의 결과로 클러스터에서 만들고 싶은 각 K8s 리소스(DeploymentConfig, Service, Ingress 등)\n \nProject 생성\n먼저 Spring Boot 기반으로 프로젝트를 생성합니다.\nIntellij 기준으로 Spring Initializr Generators 메뉴를 통해 프로젝트를 생성합니다.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n \n \nbuild.gradle에서 다음과 같이 수정합니다.\nplugins {\n  id 'java'\n  id 'org.springframework.boot' version '3.3.1'\n  id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.1.5'\n}\n\ngroup =

Class\nObservedGenerationAwareStatus 클래스를 확장합니다.\n이는 k8s의 controller가 Petclinic CR에 대한 변경사항을 추적할 수 있도록 Petclinic 오브젝트가 매번 변경될 때마다 Petclinic CR 내에 observedGeneration status 값을 증가시킵니다.\npackage

Kubernetes Operator를 직접 구현해 보았습니다. Golang에 비해 구조가 비교적 간단하고 친숙하여 더 쉽게 접근할 수 있다는 느낌이 있는데요. 기존 Java/Spring Boot 기반 서비스와의 연계성, 개발자 커뮤니티의 폭넓은 지원까지 생각해 본다면 Kubernetes Operator를 개발할 때 Java라는 언어로도 꽤나 매력적인 선택이 될 수 있습니다. Java Operator SDK 활용에 작은 도움이 되었기를 바라면서 글을 마치겠습니다.\n \n감사합니다.\n \n \n \n참조\nhttps://javaoperatorsdk.io/docs\nhttps://github.com/operator-framework/java-operator-sdk/tree/main/sample-operators\nhttps://www.baeldung.com/java-kubernetes-operator-sdk\nhttps://techtalk.11stcorp.com/2022/pdf/TECH-TALK-2022_SESSION-02.pdf",

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. Web Frontend팀 이민하입니다.\n \n지난 편에서 꿀템 서비스를 기획하고 필요한 개념들의 이름을 지어주며 이를 바탕으로 데이터베이스를 설계해 보았습니다. 이번 편에서는 어떤 기술 스택을 선택했는지 소개하도록 하겠습니다.\n \n기술 스택 선택과 개발\n\n\n \nExternal 망에는 기존에 BSD 프론트엔드 영역 어플리케이션들이 있습니다. node.js와 경량 웹프레임워크인 fastify로 되어있습니다. 프론트에서 api를 호출하면 attraction 집계 어플리케이션이 메인 데이터 저장소인 Oracle DB에서 데이터를 조회해 옵니다. 구매내역, 링크루 등 외부 api를 호출한 결과도 전달해 줍니다. \n저장된 데이터는 Admin화면을 통해 관리할 수 있습니다. 누가 어떤 피드를 작성했고 누가 좋아요 버튼을 눌렀는지, 구매는 얼마나 일어났는지 등을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n \n프론트엔드는 별도의 서버를 구축하지 않고 플러그인 형태로 개발되었습니다.\nevent  관련 어플리케이션은 프론트엔드 이름이 붙어있지만 여러 프로모션 영역의 비즈니스 로직이 많이 들어있는 어플리케이션입니다. 이번 BSD는 랭킹 탭 옆에 신규 탭으로 꿀템 탭이 신설될 것이므로 event 어플리케이션 안에 신규 생성한 attraction 어플리케이션을 번들 형태로 import 했습니다. \n\n\n\nTypescript, React 18.2\nTanstack query (aka. react-query) \napi fetching 기능을, 꿀템의 등록/편집/좋아요 처리에 개별적으로 상태를 관리하지 않아도 되서 개발에 유리하였고요\nTanstack virtual을 이용해 무한스크롤 기능을 구현하였습니다.\nevent-fe와 마찬가지로 Fastify 프레임워크를 사용하였습니다.\nVite로 번들링 하여 사내 배포시스템을 통해 배포하였습니다.\n또 아래의 특징을 갖고 있습니다.\nattraction 집계 api 호출 및 사용자 입력값 검증 (xss 방어)\n이벤트 프론트 저장소가 분리되어 있고 꿀템 저장소(attraction 프론트엔드)도 별도라서 꿀템 쪽 fastify용 코드는 attraction 프론트에서 개발하고 결과물을 fastify plugin 형태의 npm 패키지로 생성해서 이벤트 프론트 쪽에서 가져다 쓰는 방식으로 구현\n개발 중에는 attraction 프론트엔드에서 이벤트 프론트의 구성과 유사하게 dev server를 띄워서 개발하였습니다.\n \n백엔드의 기술스택은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n \n이벤트 영역에서는 C# 닷넷과 Node.js로 이루어진 어플리케이션이 많은데 팀 내에서 처음으로 Spring과 Kotlin을 적용하여 어플리케이션을 개발했습니다. 오라클을 사용하니 Stored Procedure 대신 jpa와 QueryDSL을 적용하였습니다.\nAdmin 서비스는 스프링 멀티모듈로 만들어 웹 UI와 oracle에 접속할 api가 같은 도메인 모델을 공유하도록 하였습니다.\n기존 사내에서 사용되는 공통 Admin 시스템은 사용하는 모든 도메인이 관련 프론트엔드 저장소 한 곳에 있다 보니 개발, 배포가 번거로울 때가 있습니다. 프로젝트가 무거워 빌드에도 시간이 꽤 걸리고 어플리케이션 별로 자체 스케일링하기 어렵습니다. 관련 어드민에서는 외부 시스템과의 연동을 위해 SSO(Single Sign On)을 지원합니다. 이를 이용해 사내 쿠버네티스 시스템인 fusion에 올릴 수 있는 java/kotlin, node.js 등으로 변경하면 관리포인트가 줄어 유지보수에 매우 도움이 됩니다. 또한 닷넷 프레임웍을 쓰지 않기 때문에 맥북으로 개발이 가능해집니다. 하지만 사내 어드민 공통 기능은 자체적으로 구현해야 하고 별도의 admin qa를 거쳐야 하므로 개발기간이 길어질 수 있어 개발과 유지보수의 trade off 관계라고 생각합니다. 팀 내에서는 같은 기술스택이지만 다른 어드민을 작업하고 있었기 때문에 수월하게 적용할 수 있었습니다.\nHTMX + Thymeleaf → 마찬가지로 cshtml이 아닌 htmx를 이용하여 admin ui를 구성했습니다. 완성도보다는 빠르게 기능을 구현하는데 목적을 둔 어플리케이션이지만 htmx 적용을 테크니컬 챌린지라고 말씀드릴 수 있습니다. (물론 일정이 촉박해질수록 후회를 안 할 수가 없었지만..)\nHTMX에 대해 한마디 하자면...\nhtml만 봐도 이해하기 쉽습니다.\n\n\n \nhtmx는 별도의 스크립트를 이용하지 않고 서버와 ajax 통신을 도와주는 프론트엔드 웹 프레임워크입니다. 기존에 통신하기 위해 수많은 js 코드를 만들어야 했는데 보일러 플레이트를 꽤 많이 없애 코드량 자체가 줄어드는 효과가 있습니다.\n“hx-” 프리픽스가 붙은 속성을 선언해 간편하게 원하는 데이터를 만들어 낼 수 있습니다. 필요한 기능은 Extension으로 만들 수 있어 사용성이 무궁무진합니다. 또 빌드 단계도 별도로 없어 즉시 개발할 수 있게 도와줍니다.\n장단점이 아주 명확한데요, 장점은 서버 통신할 때 js는 정말 사용하지 않고 html 본연의 목적에 충실할 수 있다. \n특히 thymeleaf와 결합하면 레이아웃 재사용으로 리액트의 컴포넌트 재사용과 같은 효과를 가질 수 있습니다. 백엔드 개발자 혼자서 프론트를 만들 수 있다는 것도 장점입니다. \n단점은 json 데이터로 api 통신을 주고받았다 보니까 받았다 보니까 html 시맨틱 태그를 응답받는 것에 적응할 시간이 필요하다는 것과  간단한 통신을 해도 쉽지 않다는 것입니다. 특히 컨트롤러에서 @RequestBody만 주로 사용해 오다가 @RequestPart, @ModelAttribute로 바꾸고 data class가 바인딩되지 않는 이슈는 한참을 헤매게 만들었습니다.\n데이터를 주고받는 데이터 패킷량도 많아져 트래픽이 많이 몰리는 프론트 서비스에서는 사용이 부담스러울 수 있습니다. \n무엇보다 필요한 기능은 결국 js를 써야 합니다 써야 합니다. Csv 엑셀 다운로드, form reset이나 date-picker를 사용하기  위한 공통 함수 작성.. 그리고 typescript를 쓸 수 없다..는 것이 또 큰 단점이죠. Htmx 레퍼런스가 많이 없어 거대한 js 덩어리를 디버깅해 가며 입맛에 맞게 수정했던 경험도 있네요. \nhtmx에 대해 아주 신랄하게 까는 아티클이 공식 홈페이지에 게시되어 있습니다..(https://htmx.org/essays/htmx-sucks/)\n어플리케이션 구현할 때 기술스택에 있어서 정답은 없습니다. fastify 대신 express를 쓸 수도 있고 nest.js를 적용할 수도 있습니다. spring 대신에 ktor를 사용할 수도, htmx 대신에 handlebar나 rythm 템플릿, jsp를 쓸 수도 있고요. 다양한 기술들은 저마다의 다양한 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. \n \n2주간 매일 스크럼을 진행했습니다.\n짧게는 1분 길게는 10분 정도의 데일리 스크럼을 진행했습니다. 현재 진행하고 있는 작업과 진척 상황을 공유했습니다. 데일리 스크럼을 통해 프로젝트의 불확실성을 조율할 수 있었고, 짧은 시간 동안만 진행하기 때문에 불필요한 추가 업무나 의논이 생기지 않았습니다. 또 별도의 회의실이 필요하지 않아 자리에 모여 진행할 수 있었습니다.\n\n  \n\n \n팀 내에서 자체 QA를 진행했습니다.\n서비스가 론칭되려면 QA(Quality Assurance) 단계를 거쳐 서비스의 이상은 없는지 확인을 하는데요 QE팀과 담당 PM분들이 같이 진행을 합니다. 사내 PM 분들의 리소스가 넉넉한 편이 아닙니다. 이때 저희 팀원분들의 자체 QA 단계를 먼저 진행해 굉장히 많은 도움을 받을 수 있었습니다. 서비스의 대략적인 프로세스만 설명하고 별도의 가이드가 제공되지 않은 상태로 자체 QA를 진행했는데요, 사소한 버그부터 불편하다고 생각하는 동선, 혹은 추가 기획 아이디어 등 수준 높은 피드백을 받을 수 있었습니다. 또한 참여하신 모두가 개발자이신 만큼 이를 개선할 방법을 제시해주시기도 하셨습니다. QA 시나리오에 없는 내용들도 꼼꼼하게 봐주셨기 때문에 서비스가 더욱 견고해질 수 있었던 이유라고 생각합니다. 론칭 준비 중인 쇼룸도 자체 QA를 진행해서 굉장히 큰 도움을 받았는데요, 개인적으로 저는 이런 팀 문화가 매우 만족스럽습니다. \n\n\n \n개발을 하던 와중에 마주한 몇 가지 이슈 상황이 있었는데요, 몇 가지 소개해보도록 하겠습니다.\nOracle DB에서 pk가 순차적(serial)으로 채번 되지 않는 이유가 있었습니다.\n\n\n \n기능을 구현하고 dev 테스트를 진행해 보니 pk가 순차적이지 않고 들쑥날쑥이었습니다들쑥날쑥 이었습니다. 저는 주로 사용했던 PostgreSQL에서는 Serial 데이터 타입이 존재해 기본적으로 pk는 순서가 보장되었지만 Oracle은 뭔가 달랐습니다. OracleDB 환경은 RAC(Real Application Cluster) 구조로 되어있습니다. 네트워크 단의 L4, L7 스위치 같은 로드밸런서와 비슷한 역할을 하고 있는데요, N개의 Instance를 통해 동일 DB에 접근할 수 있는 방법입니다.\nN개의 Instance DB의 자원을 이용하기 때문에, 한 node node의 부하를 분산시키는 효과를 갖습니다.\n \n위 RAC 구조에서 Sequence를 생성하게 되면 설정되어 있는 CACHE 옵션만큼 채번을 해 메모리로 올려둡니다. (CACHE 옵션이 20이라면 1번 node에서 1~20까지, 2번 node에서 21~40까지...)\n실제 트랜잭션에서는 커넥션을 맺은 Instance의 채번 된 sequence를 가져오게 됩니다. 그래서 순서가 보장되지 않을 수 있는 것이죠 (1, 21, 41...) pk 채번이 비즈니스 적으로 반드시 순차적인 Sequence가 보장되어야 할 때(주문, 결제 관련 트랜잭션 등)는 ORDER 옵션을 사용해 순서를 보장할 수 있습니다.\n그러나 RAC 구조에서 CACHE + ORDER 옵션을 설정하고 Sequence의 NEXTVAL()을 사용해 채번을 하게 되면 Data Dictionary가 자주 변경 되고 Exclusive instance SV lock을 필요로 하게 됩니다. 이는 동일 세션에서 Hang을 유발할 수 있기 때문에 DB에 부하를 주게 됩니다. Cache 크기를 크게 잡는다면 메모리 휘발로 인해 오히려 사용되지 않을 수 있으므로 적절한 캐시 크기를 잡는 것이 중요합니다.\n따라서 보통의 경우 유일함(Unique)만을 보장하고 싶다면 NO ORDER 옵션을 통해 Sequence를 채번하는 것이 좋습니다. 오라클에서도 CACHE 크기는 크게 잡고 NO ORDER 옵션을 권장합니다. (캐싱을 하지 않는 NO CACHE 옵션은 Oracle에서도 사용하지 말라고 권고) RAC에 대해 더 알고 싶다면 Oracle 공식 가이드를 참고하세요.\n \nSP 대신 JPA, QueryDSL을 사용했습니다.\nMSSQL의 경우에는 SP(Stored Procedure)라고 불리는 방식의 쿼링을 하는데 native query를 미리 만들어두고 이를 검수, 배포하여 어플리케이션에서 사용합니다. 쿼리의 성능을 보장하고 전사적으로 모니터링을 하기 위함입니다.\nOracle / MySQL의 경우에는 SP를 사용을 권장하지 않기 때문에 다른 DB팀의 검수 및 배포하지 않습니다. 대신 DB Consulting Jira를 통해 검수를 진행합니다. 사내에서 JPA, queryDSL 적용 가이드가 있었는데 다만 저희는 이러한 프로세스를 인지하지 못했었는데요, 실제로 dev 테스트 중에 DB Index를 설정하지 않아 조회 시 Full Scan이 일어났고 실행 시간이 매우 길어졌습니다. \n그 후 실제 적용할 Query는 만들었으나 이를 queryDSL로 포팅하는 과정에서 애를 먹었습니다. Admin에서 구매건별 구매자, 구매 금액등을 검색조건과 매핑하기 위한 화면을 그릴 때 필요한 상황이 있었는데요, 구매데이터를 저희가 생성하는 게 아니라 링크루 서비스로부터 받아오기 때문에 join조건이 상당히 복잡한 쿼리였습니다. 그 와중에 from절과 join절에 서브 쿼리를 사용하는 것을 queryDSL에서 지원을 하지 않아 의도한 대로 쿼리를 만들어낼 수 없는 이슈였습니다.\n여러 자료를 찾다가 subQuery 자체를 마치 View처럼 Entity화 하는 방법을 발견했고 이를 적용해 해결할 수 있었습니다. \n\n\n \n사내에선 다양한 도구를 활용해 프러덕을 만들어갑니다.\n\n\n사내에서 정말 다양한 개발도구를 이용해 업무를 진행합니다. it 인프라를 적극 활용하는 것이 빠르고 정확하게 서비스를 만드는 과정이라고 생각합니다.\nGit & Github\n개발소스는 형상관리 툴 중하나인 Git을 이용하고 있으며 사내 GitHub에서 소스 관리하고 있습니다. 협업을 하기 위한 필수 도구로 여러 개발자가 한 어플리케이션을 개발할 때 작업 내용, history 등을 볼 수 있습니다.\nJira\n모든 업무의 끝과 끝에는 Jira가 있습니다. 업무의 최소 단위이기에 History 관리가 잘되어야 합니다. 사내 Infra 요청에도 Jira를 사용하기에 익숙해지는 것이 좋을 것 같습니다. 각종 문의도 jira를 통합니다.\nSaturn Initializr\n세상에는 다양한 개발 도구와 이를 도와주는 라이브러리들이 있는데 보안을 이유로 사내에서만 사용하는 패키지들이 있습니다. 백엔드 어플리케이션을 생성할 때 필요한 사내 패키지를 주입해 만들어주는 Saturn Initializr를 통해 더욱 빠르게 만들 수 있습니다. \nFusion & 사내 VM 툴\n사내 Cloud Native 오케스트레이션 툴인 Fusion은 RedHat이라는 회사에서 만든 Openshift라는 툴입니다. Github 주소로부터 개발소스를 불러와 빌드, 배포하고 라우팅 할 수 있는 강력한 도구입니다. BSD 같은 큰 이벤트를 앞두고 아주 쉽게 똑같은 서버를 복제해서 운영할 수 있기 때문에 개발자들에게 있어 필수로 다뤄야 하는 툴이라고 생각합니다.\nCloud 자원이 아닌 가상 물리 서버인 Virtual Machine은 사내에선 다른 이름으로 제공해주고 있습니다. 저는 리눅스 서버를 다루는 게 편해서 해커톤이나 메세지큐 적용을 위한 poc를 해당 서비스를 통해 이용해 본 경험이 있습니다. 요새는 대부분의 툴들을 Docker 이미지로 받을 수 있으니 fusion을 이용하는 추세입니다. 사내에 docker 이미지 저장소에 원하는 이미지가 없다면 보안검수를 통해 등록하는 것이 가능합니다. \nKibana & 사내 로그 모니터링 시스템\n쿠버네티스 환경에서 최소 단위의 하드웨어, 즉 서버를 Pod라고 부르는데 이 Pod 개수가 수십, 수백 개가 되면 각 서버 내에 적재되는 로그를 찾기가 매우 어렵습니다. Pod에 쌓이는 로그를 Elastic Search라는 검색엔진을 통해 취합하고 이를 시각화하는 도구인 Kibana를 통해 타임라인별 로그를 확인할 수 있습니다.\n개발자가 유의미하다고 판단되는 로그를 모아 볼 수 있게 한 사내 서비스도 있습니다. 개발 환경별로 패키지가 제공되어 매우 간편하며 fusion을 이용하지 않는 기존 C# 닷넷에서도 해당 로깅 시스템을 이용하고 있습니다.\nnGrinder\n부하 테스트를 위한 툴입니다. Naver에서 오픈소스로 만들었고 서버가 견딜 수 있는 트래픽을 의도적으로 부하를 주어 성능 테스트를 진행할 때 사용합니다. 이번 꿀템의 경우도 실제 서비스에 얼마나 많은 사람들이 방문할지 모르기 때문에 아주 많은 성능 테스트를 진행했습니다. ride가 10만 건, 100만 건 일 때 스트레스 테스트도 문제없었습니다. nGrinder 환경 세팅은 fusion을 통해 세팅할 수 있습니다.\nDatadog\n사내에서 사용하는 APM(Application Performance Monitoring) 툴입니다. 운영 중인 어플리케이션의 요청이 기록으로 남기 때문에 타임라인 별로 트래픽을 비교하고 에러 건수를 확인할 수 있습니다. \n \n\n\n \nDependency Map 등을 통해 에러가 어느 지점에서 발생했는지 유추할 수 있어 에러 추적에 용이합니다. 또한 경보 체계를 만들어 장애 발생 시 Teams나 Slack으로 alert이 갈 수 있도록 합니다.\n \n\n\n \n이번 서비스를 런칭하면서 이런 의의가 있다고 생각합니다.\n급하게 POC를 진행했음에도 불구하고 빅스마일데이 기간 동안 장애 없이 서비스했다는 점\n개발 조직으로부터 시작된 서비스 → 아이디어를 제시하는 것 뿐아니라 구현까지 단기간에 이루어진 케이스\n프러덕 디벨롭은 누구나 챌린지 할 수 있다. → 긍정적인 영향 전파\n결국 꿀템이 오픈될 수 있었던 이유는 유관부서의 적극적인 협조가 있었기에 가능했습니다. 이 자리를 빌려 다시 한번 감사하다는 말씀드립니다.꿀템은 댓글 기능, 신고하기 기능 등 다양한 신규 기능을 가지고 한가위 빅세일에 다시 한번 진행할 예정입니다! 앞으로 성장할 꿀템 서비스를 잘 지켜봐 주세요!",

Web Frontend팀 이민하입니다.\n \n지난 빅스마일데이에 첫 론칭한 꿀템 피드 서비스! 이 서비스를 만들기 위한 여정을 여러분께 소개드리려고 합니다.\n \nIntro\n시작은 디지털 빅세일이 끝난 2월 말.. 저희 팀장님의 한마디에서 시작했습니다.\n\"챗GBT를 우리만 보기에 아깝지 않아..!?\"\n\n\n챗GBT(Gmarket Best iTem)는 임직원분들이 직접 추천하는 상품을 모아둔 페이지로 하나하나가 진짜 꿀템입니다!\n \n아깝다고 생각했습니다. 저도 GBT를 보며 많이 샀기 때문에 고객도 이 페이지를 같이 보면 구매가 많이 일어날 것이라고 생각했습니다.\n추가로 고객들이 게시글을 작성할 수 있다면..? 그러면 고객들이 우리 사이트에서 놀 수 있는 공간이 되지 않을까?\n또한 사내에서도 우리 프러덕에 커뮤니티 기능을 넣어보자는 니즈가 있었다고 들었습니다.\n자신감이 생기기 시작했습니다. 우리 사이트에 새로운 활기를 불어넣어 줄 수 있을 것 같은 그런 자신감이 생겼습니다.\n만들 수 있을 것 같은 기대감에 하나 잊어버린 것이 있었습니다.\n\"아 맞다 나 신규 서비스 만들어 본 적 없지!\"\n \n네. 저는 입사하고 이벤트 플랫폼, 한반도 기획전, 패턴6를 담당하면서 기존 서비스의 개선 작업을 주로 해왔고 \"쇼룸\"이라는 서비스를 준비 중이었으나 아직 신규 서비스를 론칭해 본 경험은 없었습니다. 그렇기 때문에 어디서부터 무엇을 작업해야 할지 머릿속에 그려지지 않았습니다.\n \n이 발표는 신규 서비스를 개발하려고 할 때 무엇을 준비해야 할지 막막한 \"개발자\"분들이 시행착오를 줄일 수 있도록 도움을 드리고자 준비하게 되었습니다.\n \n \n지속 가능한 개발을 위한 설계\n지속 가능한 설계란 보통 환경의 수용능력 범위 내에서 개발하는 것을 말하는, 도시설계에서 사용하는 개념인데요, 어플리케이션 개발에 있어서 개발 비용이 너무 많이 소모되지 않으면서 꾸준히 디벨롭하고 개선할 수 있는 프러덕을 만드는 것과 일맥상통한다고 생각합니다. 그리고 이를 위해 확장성을 고려한 설계가 필요했습니다.\n \n첫 번째로 고민한 것은 \"네이밍\"이었습니다.\n\n\n개발자에게 가장 어려운 일들\n \n개발자에게 있어 이름을 짓는다는 행위는 단순히 부르기 위한 목적보다 더 큰 의미가 있습니다. 이름만 듣고도 직관적으로 만드는 의도를 이해하는데 도움이 되어야 합니다. 저희도 구현하고자 하는 개념을 포괄할 수 있어야 한다고 생각했습니다. 또한 기존 개념과 헷갈리지 않도록 사내에서 사용되지 않는 단어를 선택해야 했습니다. 그러다 문득\n우리 사이트에서 놀 수 있어야 한다.. → 즐길 거리!? 그러면 게시글을 \"놀이 기구\"에 비유하면 어떨까?\n \n챗GBT는 Padlet이라는 공유 게시판 서비스를 이용하였는데 그 padlet안에 게시글을 포스팅할 수 있는 빈 보드에 해당하는 영역을 \"Attraction\"이라 명명했습니다. 어트랙션은 놀이 공원의 놀이 기구라는 뜻으로 사용되곤 하지만 실제로는 매력, 즐길 거리, 명소 등의 뜻을 가지고 있습니다. 부동산 개발 업계에서는 도시의 랜드마크나 코엑스의 별마당 도서관처럼 상업 시설 내 차별화를 두는 장소를 어트랙션이라고 부르기도 합니다. \nAttraction에 들어갈 게시글 하나하나는 놀이기구, 탈 것을 의미하는 \"Ride\"로 부르기로 하였습니다. Attraction 하위에 존재하며 등록, 수정이 가능한 컨텐츠입니다.해당 프로젝트에서 가장 중요한 개념이며 Ride의 퀄리티에 따라 이 서비스의 흥행이 정해질 것이라 생각했습니다.\n마지막으로 Ride를 업로드할 수 있는 사람을 지칭하는 개념이 필요했습니다. 이 사람은 지마켓, 옥션의 회원 일 수도, 셀러 고객일 수도, 임직원 일 수도 있기 때문에 이를 포괄하는 개념이어야 했습니다.\n그러므로 Ride의 탑승객을 의미하는 \"Passenger\"로 명명했습니다. 그렇게 핵심 개념인 Attraction, Ride, Passenger 가 탄생했고 자연스레 이 프로젝트의 이름은 지마켓의 놀이공원, \"G-world\"가 되었습니다.\n \n확장성을 염두에 두고 하위 속성을 정의하기 시작했습니다.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n프로젝트 이름을 정하고나서 머릿속에 있는 내용을 화이트보드에 정리해봤습니다.\n \n \n팀원들과 본격적으로 G-world의 얼개를 짜기 시작했습니다. 개발자가 기획하는 것이다 보니 어떤 식으로 접근해야 할지 몰랐습니다. 해당 페이지를 어디에 노출시킬 것이며 어떤 속성이 필요한지를 고민했습니다.\nAttraction은 챗GBT처럼 저희 영업본부 임직원 분들이 올릴 수도 있고, 고객들도 업로드할 수 있어야 했고 상품을 공유했을 때 구매 적립받을 수 있도록 Linkrew 와의 연동이 필요하다고 생각했습니다. (Linkrew 란 누구나 상품 링크를 공유해 수익을 셰어 받는 지마켓의 신규 제휴서비스입니다.)\n \nRide는 상품은 구매 내역에서 불러오거나, 구매 내역 없이 단순히 상품을 추천하거나, 임직원이 올릴 수 있는 3가지 형태가 있을 수 있다고 판단했습니다. 그리고 구매 기록에 기반한 태그(첫 구매시기, 재구매 횟수 표시 등)를 게시하여 Ride의 리뷰 신뢰도를 높일 수 있는 방안을 생각해 보았습니다. 또한 Ride 내에 승객이 직접 해시태그를 넣고 이를 필터링할 수 있는 기능, 좋아요 표시를 통한 인기 Ride에 대한 리스팅 기능 등 정말 다양한 방안이 나왔습니다.\nRide의 상품 카테고리를 통해 특정 기획전 콘셉트에 맞는, 혹은 유저가 원하는 상품의 Ride를 모아볼 수 있는 필터링 기능도 넣었습니다. 댓글 기능도 들어가야 커뮤니티로써 기능한다고 생각했습니다.\n \nContent Quality에 대한 우려가 가장 큰 고민이었는데, 이용약관 동의 하기 위한 동선, 동일 상품의 Ride가 올라올 경우 모아서 보여준다던지, 콘텐츠가 활발하게 업로드될 수 있도록 승인 대신 선 게시 후 모니터링이 필요하다고 생각했고 이를 위한 신고 기능도 개발할 필요가 있음을 인지했습니다.\n \n사흘 동안 얼추 구상한 내용을 팀장님께 말씀드리고 피드백을 받았습니다.  최초 아이디어를 팀장님이 주신만큼 개발 가능한 범위와 설계 타당성에 대한 검증을 해주시고 조언에 따라 수정을 거쳤습니다.\n이번 빅스마일데이(5월)에 적용할 POC(Proof of Concept)를 만들어보자!\n \n이 때는 3월 초. 그리고 저는 3월 중순에 오랜 기간 염원해 오던 미국 여행을 앞두고 있었습니다....\n여행 가서 노트북을 펼치지 않으려면 지금 빠르게 설계를 마쳐야 한다는 위기의식이 생겨났습니다. (네? 다음 달까지요?)\n \n본격적으로 테이블을 설계할 때가 됐습니다.\n\n\n저는 개인적으로 PostgreSQL을 자주 사용해 왔습니다.\n \n가장 먼저 해야 할 일은 “어떤 DBMS를 선택해야 하는가?”입니다. 사내에선 다양한 DBMS를 이용해 다양한 프러덕을 만들고 있습니다. 각 DB는 저마다의 장단점을 가지고 있습니다.\n저장할 데이터 양이 많지는 않으면서도 POC 끝나고 데이터의 사용성을 고려했을 때 정합성이 가장 중요하다고 생각했습니다. 따라서 팀 내에선 성능과 안전성을 고려하면 Oracle을 사용하는 데에 이견이 없었습니다. 더불어 이번 BSD는 지마켓만 오픈하지만 옥션으로 확장할 수 있다는 생각도 있었습니다.\n \n테이블 명은 ATTRACTION, RIDE, PASSENGER가 정해졌지만 테이블 내 속성을 의미하는 칼럼은 해당 키워드를 사용하기에 길다고 느껴졌습니다. 그래서 각 단어의 축약형이 필요했는데 보통 개발자들은 영어 단어의 첫 글자를 제외한 모음을 지워서 3~5글자로 만듭니다. Attraction의 모음을 없애면 Attr이죠. 제가 방금 네이밍에 있어서 기존 개념과 헷갈리지 않아야 한다고 말씀드렸습니다. 해당 단어를 현재 사내에서 사용하고 있는지 먼저 찾아볼 필요가 있습니다.\n \n\n\n사내 메타 데이터 관리 사이트\n \n사내 Meta data를 관리하는 사이트에서 표준 단어로 검색을 해봅니다. 이는 \"속성\"을 뜻하는 Attribute의 축약형과 동일합니다. 따라서 이 경우에는 \"ATRC\"로 축약형을 정하였습니다.\nRide는 글자 수가 적기 때문에 Ride 그대로 사용해도 무방하다고 판단했고, Passenger는 탑승객의 항공업계 공식 약어인 \"PAX\"를 사용하기로 하였습니다.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n테이블의 논리적인 칼럼명은 주로 한글 표기하고 물리적인 칼럼명은 영문으로 표기합니다. 칼럼의 Data Type은 DBMS 별로 조금씩 달라지긴 하나 보편적인 타입을 선언하였습니다. 그리고 해당 칼럼의 길이를 러프하게 정하고 Null 여부와 초기값 등을 설정하는 표를 만들었습니다.\nAttraction을 기획하면서 구상한 내용을 담기 위해 테이블에 콘텐츠의 생성, 조회 권한 칼럼을 두었습니다. 이는 추후 유니버스 클럽 고객 만을 위한 Attraction을 만들 수도 있게 하였습니다. \n디지털, 신선식품 등 특정 카테고리 상품군 만을 Ride로 올릴 수 있도록 Attraction Category 테이블을 설계했습니다. Attraction 테이블에 칼럼으로 넣지 않고 Category 테이블을 별도로 만든 이유는 Attraction이 기획전, 상품평, 코너 등에 사용될 수 있다고 판단하여 확장성을 고려한 설계가 필요하다고 느꼈기 때문입니다.\n데이터를 구조화하는 작업을 테이블의\"정규화\"라고 합니다. 중복 데이터를 없애기 위한 용도로도 사용되지만 여기서는 데이터베이스의 구조 확장 시 재 디자인 하는 것을 최소화하기 위한 목적으로 사용되었습니다.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRide는 우리 사이트의 상품과 연동할 수 있어야 했습니다. 이번 BSD에서는 BSD 기간에 태그가 붙은 상품을 구매한 경우에만 구매 내역에서 불러와 Ride Goods로 등록할 수 있게 하였습니다. 그 외 좋아요를 저장하는 Ride Recommend 테이블과 신고할 수 있는 Ride Report 테이블, 댓글을 저장할 Ride Comment 테이블을 설계하였습니다. \n \n\n\n \nPassenger의 경우에는 여태까지 사내에 없던 정말 생소한 개념이기에 테이블 설계하는데 애를 먹었습니다. \n기본적으로 아래의 문제 상황이 존재했습니다.\nGmarket의 id 중복 문제 → 기본 id들이 있기 때문에 Gmarket은 유니크한 id 식별자를 봐야 함\nG/A 간 회원 식별자가 다른 것 → Auction 에는 회원 식별자가 없음\nAdmin도 참여할 수 있는 서비스 → Admin id가 G/A와 중복될 수 있음\n \n  MyG, MyA 등의 내 정보와 연동하기 위해선 타 팀과의 논의가 필수불가결합니다. 하지만 커뮤니케이션 비용 절감 및 확장 가능성을 고려해 (지마켓 그 너머..) 유저아이디, 회원 식별자, 사이트 종류 세 가지 속성을 이용해 기존 지/옥/Admin 계정 정보와 논리적인 Relation을 맺는 것이 합리적이라 판단했습니다. 지마켓, 옥션, Admin 계정의 유저 id는 중복될 수가 있으므로 pax의 id 칼럼을 만들어 유저 id로 넣어두되 사이트 종류 칼럼으로 구분할 수 있습니다\n따라서 Passenger 테이블의 pk 만을 보고 유일한 탑승객임을 보장할 수 있게 되었습니다.\n추후 해당 승객의 등급, 뱃지 등 게이미픽케이션 요소를 넣기 위한 칼럼도 정의하였습니다. 해당 탑승객에 대한 정보는 Passenger 테이블에만 저장됩니다.\n이 모든 속성은 G-world 서비스에서만 이용하는 것이기 때문에 개인정보를 저장하지 않는다는 것이 중요했습니다. (개인정보 보호테이블이 되면 Meta System 내에서 별도로 관리되어 관리 포인트가 많아집니다.)\n기본적으로 모든 테이블에는 Insert Operator, Update Operator와 관련한 칼럼이 포함되어야 합니다. 그래서 해당 칼럼에 생성 승객과 수정 승객 번호를 넣으려고 했습니다. 그러나 담당 DA분께서 아래와 같은 가이드를 주셨습니다.\n \n Insert Operator, Update Operator는 이 데이터를 (ROW) 만들거나 수정한 시스템(또는 플랫폼) 정보여야 합니다.\n즉, 시스템명, Application명, Host 정보명(Pod명) 등을 뜻하며, 고객의 개인정보(로그인 ID 등)를 저장해서는 안됩니다.\n \n따라서 별도로 공통 칼럼을 만들어 모든 테이블에 전부 넣어주었습니다. \n\n\n \n설계는 항상 꼼꼼해야 하지만 칼럼 추가나 수정은 개발되는 기간 내내 발생할 수 있기 때문에 너무 완벽함을 추구해선 안됩니다.\n \n설계를 마치고 테이블을 생성했습니다.\n사내에서 주제영역으로 불리는 개념이 있는데 Database의 schema라고 생각해 주시면 이해가 잘 될 것 같습니다. 물리적인 스키마명을 통일해 사용하지만 실제 주제영역은 Meta 데이터 관리 시스템을 통해 관리됩니다.\n \nG-world는 신규 서비스이므로 Attraction이라는 이름의 새로운 주제영역을 신청하였습니다.\n\n\n \n위처럼 Entity를 선언하고 Entity끼리의 Relationship을 맺어주면 ERD가 완성됩니다. 물리적, 논리적 ERD를 각각 구성해야 합니다.\n \n참고로 사내에서는 실제 테이블이 생성될 때 외래키(FK)를 반영하지 않습니다. 외래키 라고 하는 것은 두 테이블을 연결시켜 주는 다리라고 생각하면 이해가 빠른데 Ride 테이블에 상위 테이블인 Attraction의 키 값이 있거나 Ride Goods 테이블에 Ride의 키 값이 들어있는 것을 말합니다. 보통 관계형 데이터베이스에 대해 배울 때는 PK와 FK 설정을 통한 데이터 무결성, 정합성 보장을 한다고 하지만 성능, 개발, 유지보수에 있어서 trade off 관계이기 때문에 현업에서는 물리적인 fk는 정의하지 않는 편입니다. 그러므로 Meta 시스템을 통해 정합성을 보장하려고 하죠.\n \n이제 G-World를 소개하기로 했습니다.\n지난 일주일 간의 개발자들이 기획 / 설계한 것을 가지고 기획팀, 디자인팀과 자리를 마련해 팀장님이 처음으로 G-World에 대해 말씀드렸습니다.\n \n\n\n걱정반 기대반이었습니다. 기획 / 디자인 리소스가 부족하면 이번 BSD에 보여주기는 힘들 것 같았습니다. \n해봅시다!\n \n다행히 긍정적으로 검토해 주시고 챌린지 해보자는 뜻이 모아졌습니다.\n이번 BSD는 5월 7일부터 시작했으므로 2달이 남아있었지만 QA 기간까지 끝내려면 한 달 안에 기획 / 디자인 / 퍼블리싱 / 개발을 모두 마쳐야 했습니다. (네?! 다음 달 까지요!?)\nBSD에 진행하는 것이 확정이 되고 전 예정대로 휴가를 가게 되었습니다. 그 사이 팀원분들이 울퉁불퉁한 설계도에 필요한 테이블과 칼럼을 추가해 주시면서 무사히 G-world의 데이터베이스가 생성될 수 있었습니다.\n \n다음 편에는 전체적인 Data Flow와 기술스택에 대해 소개해드리겠습니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요.\nSeller & SD Engineering팀의 김민우입니다.\n \n이번 글은 ESM(지마켓 판매자 사이트) 개편 중 '문의하기' 개발을 맡으며 겪었던 어려움과 이를 해결해 나가는 몇 가지 방법들을 소개하고자 합니다. 제가 개발 맡은 부분은 판매자에게 구매자의 문의내용을 담당하는 '게시판 문의', 그리고 CS(고객센터)에서 주는 '긴급 메시지'를 통합하여 지마켓과 옥션  두 사이트에 대해 각각 보여주는 통합 페이지를 개편시키는 일이었습니다.\n \n각설하고 조회 성능을 올린 결과물부터 영상으로 보시죠.\n\n\n\n \n  영상에서 보셨듯이, 대형 셀러의 경우 한 페이지를 로드하는 데 기본 몇십 초가 걸립니다. 페이지를 넘길 때조차 마찬가지입니다. 상품이 많아질수록 문의도 증가하기 마련인데, 모든 문의에 일일이 답변하기는 어렵기 때문에 미응답으로 남는 경우가 많습니다. 이러한 어드민 페이지를 개편할 때 보통 프론트엔드 중심으로 성과를 드러내는 경우가 많았고, 저 역시 해당 프로젝트를 처음 배정받았을 때는 성능 개선에 대한 기획은 없었습니다. 백엔드 로직은 그대로 두되 UI/UX를 고치는 것이 본래 목적이었습니다. 하지만 백엔드 개발이 메인인 저는 충격적인 성능을 목격하고서, 이번 프로젝트에서 백엔드에서도 성과를 낼 수 있음을 보여주기 위해, 두려움과 동시에 최선을 다해야겠다고 마음먹었습니다.\n \n저에게 주어진 과제의 걸림돌이었던 점을 나열해보겠습니다.\n \n \n1. 답변까지 복수로 조회\n \n  구버전에서는 문의를 클릭해야만 해당 문의에 대한 답변을 볼 수 있었습니다. 많은 판매자 분들이 답변을 일괄적으로 처리하지 못하고 하나하나 처리해야 한다는 어려움을 호소해 주셨습니다. 그래서 새로운 버전에서는 답변 칸을 문의 옆에 짝지어 나열하는 UI/UX로 변경하게 되었습니다. 그러나 개발자로서 이미 몇십 초가 걸리는 조회 로직에 답변까지 함께 짝지어서 조회하려면 얼마나 더 오래 걸릴지 막막하기만 했습니다.\n \n \n\n\n \n \n \n2. 네 가지의 도메인을 데이터 구조는 그대로 두고 통합\n \n앞서 서두에서 언급했듯이, 지마켓/옥션 각각의 '게시판 문의'와 '긴급 메시지'라는 비슷하지만 엄연히 다른 도메인을 한 가지 표에 통합해야 했습니다. 흔히 1번에 이어서 ESM 전용으로 조회하기 좋은 단순한 데이터베이스를 구상해 본다면 다음과 같습니다.\n \n\n\n \n \n서로 다른 정책과 프로세스를 가진 제각각 2000년대 중반에 아우르는 유서 깊은 레거시들을 전부 다 조사하는 것도 일이었지만, 데이터 자체를 그대로 둔 채로 통합하면서 속도 성능을 내야 하는 건 생각보다 큰 과제였습니다.\n\n\n \n데이터를 분석하면서 충격적이었던 점은 옥션 긴급 메시지를 제외하고는 '질문'과 '답변'이 같은 테이블에 섞여 들어가 있다는 점이었습니다. 한 질문에 대한 답변을 찾으려면 셀프 조인을 해야 했습니다. 그렇다고 파티션이 되어 있는 것도 아니었습니다. 질문과 답변이 1:1 관계도 아니었고, 한 개의 질문에 대해 여러 번 답변이 가능한 구조였습니다. 가뜩이나 답변 하나 가져오는 데도 몇십 초가 걸리는 상황에서, 같은 테이블에서 셀프 조인하고 여러 답변 중 가장 최신의 답변을 가져와야 했습니다.\n통상적으로 이런 통합된 페이지의 성능을 높이려면 데이터 구조부터 바꾸거나 기존 테이블들을 그대로 두되, 새로 구상한 테이블에 기존 테이블의 데이터를 배치나 스트림을 통해 미리 최신의 답변을 집계하고 데이터를 통합해서 주기적으로 업데이트하는 것이 최적의 방법입니다. 그러나 개발 공수 기간이 짧아 이 방법을 적용할 수 없었습니다.\n \n \n3. 대용량의 데이터베이스\n \n  해당 테이블들의 정확한 데이터양 수치를 서술하기에는 보안상의 이슈가 있을 것 같아 대략적으로 말씀드리자면, 상품 및 주문 도메인 관련 테이블들과 비슷하게 엄청난 볼륨을 가지고 있었습니다. 데이터베이스들의 생성 시기와 가장 오래된 데이터의 날짜를 비교해 보면, 그나마 한 번쯤은 데이터를 정리한 것 같습니다만, 근 10년간의 게시판 문의와 긴급 메시지들이 쌓여 있다는 점에서도 두려웠습니다. 대용량 데이터를 주로 다뤘던 경험상, 데이터베이스의 크기 자체는 대용량까지는 아니지만, 행(Row)의 수는 중견급 마켓의 상품 수와 맞먹을 정도였습니다.\n \n이 때문에 인덱스를 새로 추가하는 것도 이미 큰 데이터베이스에 무리가 가기에 리스크가 있었고, 오래된 데이터를 비우는 일도 마이그레이션과 더불어 파티셔닝에 신경 써야 했기 때문에 개발 공수를 맞추기에는 부족했습니다. 따라서 추후 옵션으로 고려할 수는 있으나, 기존 데이터베이스 테이블들을 건드는 일 자체가 당장은 어렵다는 것이 확실했습니다.\n \n\n\n \n이런 비슷한 상황에서 조회 속도를 어떻게 올릴 것인가를 고민하는 다른 여러 개발자들을 위해 제가 해결해 나간 과정을 소개합니다. \n \n우선 방법 소개에 앞서, 잠깐 언급할 개념이 있습니다. 개발을 대학 전공으로 배울 때 가장 먼저 입문하게 되는 것이 '자료구조'와 '알고리즘' 수업입니다. '자료구조'는 주로 공간(메모리)을 어떻게 효율적으로 활용할 것인지를 다루고, '알고리즘'은 소요 시간을 얼마나 줄일 수 있는지를 공부합니다. 이 둘의 관계는 시간과 공간을 대표하는 과목들로, 컴퓨팅에 대한 중요한 법칙을 내포하고 있다고 생각합니다. 일반적으로 이 시간과 공간은 반비례 관계에 있다고 보시면 됩니다 (꼭 그런 것은 아닙니다만 대체로 그렇습니다).\n \n \n아래 그림처럼 A → B로 가는 경우의 수를 구하는 문제를 보면, 직접 선을 하나씩 그려가며 A에서 시작해서 B로 가는 선을 10개 그려서 경우의 수를 구할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 이렇게 풀면 시간이 오래 걸리고 결국 OMR 마킹도 못하고 내는 경우도 있을 겁니다.\n출처 : https://blog.naver.com/dongmin9313/221712819012\n\n\n \n하지만 우리는 아래 그림과 같은 방법으로도 풀 수 있다는 것을 초등학교와 고등학교 수학 시간에 배웠습니다. 이 방법으로는 A와 B를 한 번씩만 보고 넘기며, 각 칸에 정보를 저장해 가며 한 번에 해결할 수 있습니다.\n출처 : https://blog.naver.com/dongmin9313/221712819012\n\n\n \n  공교롭게도, 이 방법을 다시 자료구조나 알고리즘 전공 수업 때 파스칼의 삼각형을 배우며 익히게 됩니다. 이러한 프로그래밍 기법을 DP(동적 계획법, dynamic programming)이라고 배웁니다. 백트래킹을 하지 않고도 메모리를 조금 더 쓰면 경우의 수를 좀 더 빨리 구할 수 있다는 것입니다.\n \n  그러나 메모리와 같은 공간적인 개념은 저장공간의 효율적인 대중화로 인해 개발자들이 크게 신경 쓰지 않게 되었으며, 알고리즘 또한 다양한 라이브러리들이 많아서 코드에서는 잘 드러나지 않아 둘 다 간과되는 경우가 많습니다. 비즈니스에 직결되는 개발의 구현 여부만 신경 쓰다 보니, 구 ESM 문의하기도 처음에는 신경 써서 설계했겠지만, 10여 년이 지난 지금은 여러 요구사항들이 덧붙여져 땜질된 상태였습니다. 결과적으로 일부 구현에만 신경 쓴 여러 코드들이 전체적인 시간복잡도나 공간복잡도를 간과한 것들이 쌓이고 쌓여, 결국 어느새 엄청 느려진 조회 속도를 방치할 수밖에 없었습니다. 저 또한 이번에 개편한 코드가 몇십 년 후에는 땜질되어 느려질 수 있기 때문에, 이 프로젝트에 참여한 개발자들을 골라서 탓하는 것은 옳지 않다고 생각합니다.\n \n제가 이토록 시간과 공간의 반비례 관계를 강조해도 잊어버릴 수 있는 분들을 위해, 포켓몬스터 게임의 예를 들어 보겠습니다. 게임에는 '시간'을 관장하는 디아루가와 '공간'을 관장하는 펄기아라는 전설의 포켓몬이 항상 싸웁니다. (이 게임의 버전 이름이 공교롭게도 포켓몬스터 \"DP\"입니다.) 이 둘의 관계를 다시 떠올려 보면, 처리 시간을 줄이기 위해 어떤 방법을 선택해야 할지 판단이 더 빨리 설 것입니다.\n \n출처 : https://www.pokemon.com\n\n\n \n \n다음은 제가 이와 연관해서 실마리를 얻고 구 버전에서 신 버전으로 로직을 옮기며 성능을 해결해 나가는 부분에 대한 서술입니다.\n \n1. 인덱스를 활용하지 못한 경우\n \n  인덱스는 데이터베이스를 빠르게 조회할 수 있다는 장점이 있지만, 데이터베이스의 각 행(row)을 기준으로 많은 공간을 사용하게 된다는 단점이 있습니다. 이는 공간을 내어주고 시간을 절약한다는 제 본론과 매우 부합하는 개념 중 하나입니다.\n \n  문의 리스트를 가져오는 부분은 신 버전과 구 버전이 대체로 비슷합니다. 두 버전은 동일한 데이터베이스 테이블을 바라보고 있으며, 주로 원하는 검색 필터를 기준으로 WHERE 절에 적용하고, 테이블에 없는 추가적인 데이터는 따로 JOIN을 통해 가져옵니다. 그러나 두 버전의 차이를 만든 원인 중 하나는 SellerID를 통합해서 조회하는 방법입니다. 저희 회사 정책상 ESM을 보고 있는 한 셀러는 MasterID가 있고, 그 아래에는 여러 하위 SellerID들이 있습니다. '문의하기' 페이지는 이러한 MasterID에 속한 모든 SellerID를 가지고 해당 SellerID에게 주어진 문의들을 전부 조회해야 합니다.\n \n \n가장 크리티컬 했던 요소 중 하나를 꼽자면 다음과 같은 코드입니다. (아래 코드는 예시입니다.)\nforeach (string sellerId in request.sellerList.Split(','))\n{\n    GetList(request); // SQL 실행\n}\n\n//Stored Procedure (SQL)\n\nSELECT ~~~\nFROM TABLE\n//기타 JOIN 생략\nWHERE SELLER_ID = @SELLER_ID\n   AND ~~~~\n \n반면 제 것은 다음과 같습니다.\nSELECT ~~~~~\nFROM TABLE \n  JOIN STRING_SPLIT(@SELLER_ID_LIST, ',') AS SPLIT ON TABLE.SELLER_ID = SPLIT.value\n  //기타 JOIN 생략\n  WHERE ~~~~~~~\n \n단순히 둘의 시간복잡도를 구상했을 때는 s를 셀러의 개수, q를 뽑아낸 문의 개수로 치환한다면 다음과 같습니다.\n\n기존 접근법:\n\n판매자 ID 분리: O(s)\n각 판매자별 데이터 가져오기: O(s * q log q)\n가져온 데이터들 병합: O(s*q)\n개선된 접근법:\n\n판매자 ID 합치기: O(s)\nSQL 쿼리 실행 및 JOIN: O(s*q)  or s가 인덱스가 되어있으면 O(q log s)\n \n \n다행히 해당 테이블들은 SellerID에 인덱스가 걸려 있으므로 최종적으로 시간복잡도는 O(s * q log q) vs O(q log s)가 됩니다. 아래 그래프에서도 알 수 있듯이, Big O의 경우 n^2이 걸리는 순간 엄청난 소요 시간 차이가 발생합니다. 개발자 취준생들에게 이중 for loop를 최대한 피하라고 하는 이유도 여기 있습니다. 코딩 테스트에서 수행 시간 테스트가 점수에 포함되는 것도 그 때문입니다. MasterID에 딸린 셀러 개수가 많을수록, 테이블 자체에 있는 총 문의 개수가 많아질수록 조회 속도가 느려질 수밖에 없는 상황이었던 것입니다.\n\n\n제가 제시한 방법의 단점은, 그래도 JOIN을 위해 해당 SELLER_ID_LIST를 내부적으로 임시 테이블로 만들고 JOIN 하기 때문에 공간을 포기하는 셈이라는 점입니다.\n \n \n2. 임시 테이블과 JOIN 활용하기\n \n또 다른 사례는 답변과의 임시테이블을 만들고 나서 JOIN 하는 방식입니다. 구버전에서 몇 SQL 들은 비록 답변을 하기 위해 질문을 클릭해야만 답변 내용을 표시해 주어서 답변 관련 JOIN은 필요 없을 줄 알았지만, 놀랍게도 답변 시각과 제목은 list로 같이 짝지어 보여주고 있었기 때문에 답변 관련 데이터들은 이미 답변과 짝도 짓고 있었던 셈입니다.\n\n\n \n기존 전략은 단순히 답변 테이블과 JOIN 한 후에 WHERE 절로 검색 필터에 들어온 값들을 걸러내는 방식이었습니다.\nSELECT ~~~~\nFROM QUESTION\nLEFT JOIN ANSWER\nWHERE ~~~~~~\n \n  반면, 저는 인덱스가 되는 검색 필터 값들을 먼저 걸러낸 임시 테이블을 만든 후에 JOIN을 했습니다. 이렇게 하면 한꺼번에 JOIN 하는 것보다 후보지가 줄어들고, 나머지 인덱스가 걸리지 않은 것들은 WHERE 절에서 거르더라도 시간이 덜 걸립니다. 이 역시 임시 테이블을 위해 공간을 더 쓰는 방식이지만, 한편으로는 더욱 빠른 속도를 수행하게 됩니다.\nWITH FilteredQuestions AS (\n    SELECT ~~~~\n    FROM QUESTION\n    LEFT JOIN ANSWER ON ~~~~\n    WHERE ~~~~(여기는 인덱스값) AND ~~~~ AND ~~~~\n)\nSELECT ~~~~\nFROM QUESTION\nJOIN FilteredQuestions ON ~~~~\nWHERE ~~~~ AND ~~~~\n \n  게다가 이번 개편을 통해 한 가지 호재가 더 있었습니다. 답변의 타이틀을 없앤다는 정책이 새로 만들어졌고, 답변이 없는 '미처리' 상태로 조회하는 것이 디폴트가 되었습니다. 따라서 판매자가 '미처리'된 문의 건들을 조회할 때는 굳이 답변을 JOIN 할 필요가 없게 되었습니다.\n \n그래서 저는 사용자가 검색 필터로 넣는 '처리 상태' 값에 따라 쿼리를 분기 처리하는 아이디어를 냈습니다. 만약 '미처리' 상태로 조회할 경우, 답변과 JOIN 하지 않는 쿼리를 사용하고, '처리 완료'나 '전체'라는 값이 들어올 때만 위의 쿼리를 사용하는 것입니다\n \nSELECT ~~~~\nFROM QUESTION\nWHERE ~~~~~~\n \n \n2. Hash Table (Map, Dictionary 등)을 적극적으로 활용하기\n \n1) Enum에서 Map 활용하기 \n \n  사실 이 또한 코딩테스트를 보게 되면 지겹도록 익히게 되는 법칙이지만, Hash Table을 사용하면 시간 복잡도가 O(1)로 월등히 줄어듭니다. 생각보다 많은 개발자들이 놓치는 것 중 하나는 Hash Table이 매칭/매핑할 때 무엇보다 큰 성능을 발휘한다는 점입니다. 가장 큰 예시로는 Enum을 사용할 때입니다. Enum은 일종의 나열된 집합체로, 가독성과 해시 성질 덕분에 많은 코드에서도 여전히 많이 발견됩니다.\n \n아래의 예시는 실제 코드는 아니고 제가 임시로 만든 코드입니다.\nimport lombok.Getter;\nimport lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;\n\n@Getter\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\npublic enum PhoneAreaEnum {\n    SEOUL(\"서울\", \"02\"),\n    BUSAN(\"부산\", \"051\"),\n    DAEGU(\"대구\", \"053\"),\n    INCHEON(\"인천\", \"032\"),\n    GWANGJU(\"광주\", \"062\"),\n    DAEJEON(\"대전\", \"042\");\n\n    private final String koreanName;\n    private final String code;\n\n    public static String findByCode(String code) {\n        for (PhoneAreaEnum area : PhoneAreaEnum.values()) {\n            if (area.getCode().equals(code)) {\n                return area.getKoreanName();\n            }\n        }\n        return null;\n    }\n}\n \n  여기서 만약 조회한 문의 건들 안에 code만 있어서 이를 front에서 표시하기 위한 koreanName을 가져와야 한다면 다음과 같이 PhoneAreaEnum.findByCode(entity.code)를 썼을 텐데요. 보다시피 해당 코드는 for를 돌아 O(문의 결과 리스트 * Enum 개수)을 돌게 됩니다.\n \nimport lombok.Getter;\nimport lombok.RequiredArgsConstructor;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.Map;\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\n\n@Getter\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\npublic enum PhoneAreaEnum {\n    SEOUL(\"서울\", \"02\"),\n    BUSAN(\"부산\", \"051\"),\n    DAEGU(\"대구\", \"053\"),\n    INCHEON(\"인천\", \"032\"),\n    GWANGJU(\"광주\", \"062\"),\n    DAEJEON(\"대전\", \"042\");\n\n    private final String koreanName;\n    private final String code;\n\n    private static final Map<String, PhoneAreaEnum> codeToEnumMap = Arrays.stream(PhoneAreaEnum.values())\n            .collect(Collectors.toMap(PhoneAreaEnum::getCode, area -> area));\n\n    public static String findByCode(String code) {\n        PhoneAreaEnum area = codeToEnumMap.get(code);\n        return (area != null) ? area.getKoreanName() : null;\n    }\n}\n \n하지만 이런 식으로 바꾸면 처음에 Map을 세팅할 때에만 for loop가 돌고, 조회된 건수를 일일이 매핑할 때는 미리 만들어둔 Map에서 O(1)의 시간 복잡도로 빠르게 매핑해 나갈 수 있습니다. 특히, 많은 Enum 값을 다룰 때 이 방법이 유리합니다.\n \n \n2) 서비스 분기처리를 Map으로 하기\n \n이 외에도 사소한 시간 영향을 주는 if/else에 대한 얘기를 Map과 연관시켜 살펴보겠습니다. 저는 통합 조회 API를 만들었고, 서로 다른 사이트인 '지마켓'과 '옥션', 그리고 각각의 '게시판 문의'와 '긴급 메시지'의 비즈니스 로직을 다르게 처리하고자 했습니다. 절차지향적인 코드라면 한 컨트롤러에 한 서비스를 사용하고, if/else나 switch 문을 통해 분기 처리를 했을 겁니다. 예를 들어, '옥션 게시판 문의'가 요청으로 들어왔다면 if(옥션) 안에 if(게시판 문의)로 중첩해서 로직을 썼거나, else if (옥션 게시판 문의) 식으로 썼을 수도 있습니다. 다만, 이 방법은 미세하지만 if, else if, else if 혹은 if 안에 if를 거치기 때문에 불필요한 시간이 소요됩니다.\n \n그래서 저는 handler들을 자체적으로 만들고, Spring에 내장된 handlerMap을 사용하는 것을 권장합니다.\n예시를 들자면 다음과 같은 코드입니다.\n먼저 저의 케이스를 코드로 대강 풀이하자면 다음과 같습니다. 먼저 다음과 같이 handler interface를 만들어둡니다. 다음 코드들은 변수명도 다른 임의의 코드입니다.\npublic interface QnaQueryListHandler {\n    List<MappedEntity> processList(HandlerRequest request);\n}\n \n다음, 옥션과 지마켓 각각의 인터페이스 혹은 추상 클래스로 각각 사이트별로 처리하는 방식을 먼저 정합니다. 저는 FeignClient를 의존성 주입하기 위해 추상 클래스를 사용했고, 'AbstractAuctionQnaQueryListHandler'와 'AbstractGmarketQnaQueryListHandler'를 만들어 각각 사이트별로 다른 방법을 오버라이딩하여 분기합니다.\n@Service\npublic abstract class AbstractAuctionQnaQueryListHandler implements QnaQueryListHandler {\n\n    private String extractIds(HandlerRequest request) {\n        // 해당 방법은 지마켓 옥션이 다르기 때문에 분기될만함.\n        return \"\";\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<MappedEntity> processList(HandlerRequest request) {\n        String ids = extractIds(request);\n        return handleIds(ids, request);\n    }\n\n    protected abstract List<? extends MappedEntity> handleIds(String ids, HandlerRequest request);\n}\n \n그런 다음, 옥션에 해당되는 게시판 문의에 대한 비즈니스 로직을 작성합니다.\n@Service(\"AUCTION_BOARD_INQUIRY_QUERY_LIST_HANDLER\")\npublic class AuctionBoardQueryListHandler extends AbstractAuctionQnaQueryListHandler {\n\n    @Override\n    protected List<? extends MappedEntity> handleIds(String ids, HandlerRequest request) {\n        // 생략\n        return new ArrayList<>();\n    }\n}\n \n이와 같은 방식으로 지마켓 긴급 메시지, 지마켓 게시판 문의, 옥션 긴급 메시지도 동일하게 작성합니다. 이렇게 하면 QnaQueryListHandler에 묶인 서비스들이 하나의 Map으로 Spring에 내장된 기능에 의해 생성됩니다. 이를 서비스 단에 의존성 주입하고 사용하면 됩니다.\n@RequiredArgsConstructor\npublic class QnaQueryServiceImpl implements QnaQueryService {\n\n    private final Map<String, QnaQueryListHandler> qnaQueryListHandlerMap;\n    // 생략\n    \n    public QueryEntity<QueryListQueryEntity> getQueryList(QnaQueryListRequest qnaQueryListRequest) {\n        String handlerKey = String.format(\"%s_%s_QUERY_LIST_HANDLER\",\n            qnaQueryListRequest.getSite().name(), qnaQueryListRequest.getMessageType().name());\n        QnaQueryListHandler handler = qnaQueryListHandlerMap.get(handlerKey);\n        List<QueryListJpaEntity> jpaEntityList = handler.processList(qnaQueryListRequest);\n        // 생략\n    }\n}\n \n해당 방법을 사용하면 서비스별로 if/else로 분기 처리하는 것을 보다는 가독성을 가져오면서도, 사이트별 혹은 문의 유형별 공통 기능들도 쉽게 유지보수하며 성능을 약간 더 향상할 수 있는 여지가 생깁니다.\n \n3. Multithread 활용하기\n \n  Java가 Node 계열의 JavaScript나 데이터 구조화에 유리한 Python에 밀리는 추세라고는 하지만, Interpreter 언어들과 달리 Java가 근본적으로 가지고 있는 강점 중 하나는 Multithread의 활용성입니다. 범용성이 높다는 Python도 아직 JVM의 멀티스레딩과 저용량 성능을 따라오지 못하고 있습니다. 그러므로 Java 개발자라면 Multithread를 적재적소에 활용해야 한다고 봅니다. 특히 성능을 고려해야 하는 경우에는 더욱 그렇습니다.\n저의 경우, 웬만하면 같은 DB 서버에 묶여 있고 인덱스가 있으면 최대한 JOIN을 선호합니다. 관계형 데이터베이스는 이를 위해 만들어진 것이기 때문입니다. 하지만 DB 서버가 같이 묶여 있지 않거나 인덱스가 없다면 JOIN은 어렵습니다. 따라서 다른 SQL이나 API 호출을 통해 데이터를 얻은 후, 기존에 조회된 문의 결과와 매칭할 수밖에 없습니다. 이럴 때, 문의 결과 리스트 n개와 다른 데이터 리스트 m개를 이중 for문으로 처리해서는 안 되고, 아래 예제와 같이 Map을 먼저 만들어줘야 성능이 나옵니다.\n\nMap<String, ExtraBasicInfoResponse> extraInfoMap = extraUrlConfig.getExtraBasicInfoMap(extraNumbersList, siteId);\n \n그 후 해당 Map을 가지고 매칭을 하면 되는데, 이때 단순 매칭을 위해서는 순서가 중요하지 않기 때문에 다음과 같이 Multithread를 사용하여 동시성 있게 처리하면 조회 성능을 끌어올리는 데 도움이 됩니다.\n \nreturn entityList.parallelStream()\n    .map(entity -> {\n        TempEntity tempEntity = asEntity(entity);\n        ExtraBasicInfoResponse extraInfo = extraInfoMap.get(entity.getNo());\n        // 생략\n    });\n \n \n다만, 단점은 메모리를 잡아먹기 때문에 해당 프로젝트에 같이 돌고 있는 다른 도메인들에게도 영향이 갈 수 있다는 점입니다. 제가 사용한 parallelStream은 단순하지만, 가독성을 위해 Stream 객체를 따로 만들어야 한다는 점과 Common ForkJoinPool을 사용하기 때문에 다른 곳에서도 해당 스레드풀을 사용하면 성능 향상이 예상보다 낮을 수 있습니다. 그렇다고 무작정 ForkJoinPool이나 ExecutorService와 같은 객체를 따로 만든다면 같은 parallelStream을 사용하는 도메인에는 영향을 주지 않지만 추가된 메모리 공간을 사용해야 합니다. 만약 여러 도메인들이 조회 성능만을 생각해 이런 식으로 풀을 추가했다가 총메모리를 초과해 GC 에러를 시켜 서버가 중단된다면 큰일입니다. 그러므로 더욱 신중하게 고려해야 합니다. 따라서 아무리 조회 성능을 향상한다 해도 메모리 공간을 지나치게 포기하면 안 됩니다. 다행히 저 코드 프로젝트는 parellelstream을 아직 쓰는 곳이 거의 없을뿐더러 '문의하기'처럼 규모가 있는 트래픽을 담당할만한 도메인이 아직까지는 없는 것으로 파악했습니다.\n \n \n \n4. GROUP BY를 안 쓰고도 카운트 집계 성능 내는 방법\n \n가장 문제가 되는 구버전의 조회에는 집계 기능도 포함되어 있었습니다. 집계를 할 때 거의 필수적으로 쓰이는 SQL문은 GROUP BY입니다. GROUP BY는 사용자에게 다양한 형태의 데이터를 제공하는 유용한 SQL문입니다. 다만, GROUP BY를 사용하면 유형별 임시 공간이 필요하고, 그룹화를 위해 정렬을 해야 하므로 일반적으로 O(n log n)의 시간복잡도를 가집니다.\n예시로, 구버전이 사용하는 집계 함수는 다음과 같은 코드 형태입니다.\nSELECT TYPE_CODE,\n       COUNT(*) AS COUNT\nFROM EXAMPLE\nWHERE CREATION_DATE BETWEEN @START_DATE AND @END_DATE\nGROUP BY TYPE_CODE;\n \n신버전에서는 다음과 같이 집계를 수행할 수 있습니다. 단, 이 방법은 고정된 TYPE_CODE가 정해져 있어야 합니다. 예를 들어, 성별과 같이 단순한 기준으로 row 개수를 구할 때는 유용하지만, 직업별 row 개수처럼 특정되지 않은 채로 다양한 유형별 개수를 파악할 때는 사용하기 어렵습니다.\n \nSELECT ISNULL(SUM(CASE WHEN TYPE_CODE = '1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS FATHER,\n       ISNULL(SUM(CASE WHEN TYPE_CODE = '2' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS MOTHER,\n       ISNULL(SUM(CASE WHEN TYPE_CODE = '3' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS SON,\n       ISNULL(SUM(CASE WHEN TYPE_CODE = '4' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), 0) AS DAUGHTER\nFROM EXAMPLE\nWHERE CREATION_DATE BETWEEN @START_DATE AND @END_DATE;\n \n이렇게 변경하면 GROUP BY처럼 추가적인 임시 공간을 거의 사용하지 않으며, 집계 결과를 저장할 몇 개의 변수 공간만 필요하고, 한 번만 순회하면 끝나기 때문에 시간복잡도 역시 O(n)에 그칩니다. 이처럼 무작정 시간과 공간이 반비례하는 것은 아닙니다. 포켓몬에서도 간혹 디아루가와 펄기아가 힘을 합칠 때가 있듯이 말입니다.\n \n \n출처 : https://pokemon.fandom.com/\n\n\n \n \n \n  개편된 ESM을 오픈한 지 며칠 안 된 지금, 아직까지는 큰 문제가 없어 보입니다. 더욱 빨라진 조회 속도로 인해 조회 빈도 자체가 예전에 비해 급속도로 높아진 점에서 고무적이라고 생각합니다. 기획과 UI/UX 팀에서 조회 성능을 위해 적절한 대안을 찾고, 정책적인 변화를 통해 중복되는 칼럼들을 단건씩 보이게 하여 조회 성능에 집중할 수 있게 해준 점에 대해서도 감사합니다. 이러한 변화는 구매자의 문의를 보고 싶어도 답답한 속도 때문에 못 보고 지나쳤던 판매자들에게 더 큰 기회를 줄 수 있을 것입니다. 또한, 물건을 사기 전에 답변이 오지 않아 망설였던 고객들의 발걸음을 되돌릴 수 있을 것이라 기대합니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "⚠️ 본 글은 스크럼 표준 이론을 설명하는 것이 아닙니다.\n \n안녕하세요. Dev platform 팀 임진욱입니다.\n지마켓의 Jira, Wiki, GIthub, CI/CD 시스템을 담당하고 있습니다.\n \n지마켓으로 이직 후, 1년간 업무를 진행하며 스크럼을 사용하는 경험기를 다룹니다.\n(  스크럼에 대해서 더 알고 싶은 사람은 스크럼 설명 - Jira software 문서를 참고하면 도움이 됩니다.)\n스크럼이란?\n스크럼은 팀이 일련의 가치, 원칙 및 관행을 바탕으로 작업을 구조화하고 관리할 수 있도록 지원하는 애자일 프로젝트 관리 프레임워크입니다.\n스크럼은 팀이 경험을 통해 배우고, 문제를 해결하면서 스스로 구성하며, 얻은 것과 잃은 것을 되돌아보며 지속적으로 개선하도록 유도합니다.\n \n \n 시스템 관리 엔지니어로서 연속적으로 이어지는 운영 업무들을 짧은 단위로 목표를 정해서 스크럼을 하는 것이 좋아하지 않았습니다. 억지스레 '완료' 처리를 하게 되는 경우가 생기거나, 연속적인 업무의 경우, 계획한 스프린트에서 끝내지 못하고 다음 스프린트로 연기하는 경우도 있었습니다.\n이직 후, 데일리 스크럼을 하는 것을 보고 \"여기도 스크럼을 하는구나!\" 하고 좋아하지 않았습니다. 하지만 팀에서 프로젝트를 이끌어 가는 것을 보고, 업무를 진행하는데 도움이 될 수 있겠다!라는 생각이 들었습니다. 이러한 생각이 들었던 이유는 아래와 같습니다.  \n⭐️ 팀장님이 회고때 관여를 하지 않습니다. (회고 운영 X, 팀원과 같은 위치에서 참여)\n플래닝 때 백로그 목표와 내용을 명확히 한다.\n데일리 미팅 시 짧게 진행되도록 노력한다. (스탠딩 미팅)\n그럼 실제로 어떻게 일하고 있는지 보여드리도록 하겠습니다.\n \n이렇게 일하고 있어요  ‍ \n스크럼의 단계는 아래와 같이 진행하고 있으며, 각 단계별로 어떻게 진행하고 있는지에 대해 경험을 공유드리겠습니다.\n스크럼 단계\nSprint planning -> Daily scrum -> Sprint review -> Sprint retrospective\n스프린트 플래닝\n이번 스프린트에서 어떤 작업을 할 수 있으며, 선택한 작업은 어떻게 완료하는가?\n \n 위 목적을 달성하기 위하여 팀원들과 시간을 들여 논의를 합니다. 저희 팀은 스프린트를 진행할 때, 스크럼 단계에 따라 작업을 할 수 있도록 Jira board를 활용합니다.\n \n 스프린트가 달성해야 하는 목표 항목을 백로그 로 생성합니다. 계획을 잘하기 위해서는 백로그를 긴 시간을 할애하여 생성하여야 합니다. 백로그 생성 시 알 수 없는 부분이 많거나 위험도가 높은 작업을 백로그로 등록하는 것은 지양해야 합니다. 작업 범위가 크거나 불확실성이 높은 작업은 세분화하고, 다음 스프린트를 위해 작업의 일부를 남겨 두어도 좋습니다.\n \n 프로젝트 관리자는 달성해야 하는 목표에 따라 스프린트를 생성합니다. 이때, 목표와 스프린트 기간과 시작일을 설정합니다. 스크럼을 통해 업무를 다년간 하며, 팀 스타일에 맞춰가고 있습니다. 스프린트 기간의 경우도 초기에는 대중적으로 사용하는 2주로 설정하였습니다. 저희 팀의 경우, 2주의 스프린트 기간이 너무 짧다는 의견이 스프린트 회고 때 있었고, 현재는 4주 기준으로 스프린트를 진행하고 있습니다. 즉, 시작일은 월초, 끝나는 시간은 월 말으로 설정되어 있습니다.\n\n\n\n \nJira board에서 스프린트가 생성되면 해당 스프린트에서 달성해야 하는 목표에 맞는 백로그를 스프린트에 등록하면 '스프린트 플래닝'을 위한 준비가 됩니다.\n\n\n 스프린트 플래닝 회의는 프로젝트에 관여된 모든 사람이 함께 모여 진행합니다. 스프린트 플래닝 회의는 아침부터 오후까지 길게 잡고, 스프린트 목표를 이루기 위하여 백로그를 공유합니다. 형식적인 브리핑이 아닌 함께 하는 팀원들이 업무 내용을 이해할 수 있도록 상세하게 설명을 해야 합니다.\n \n 각 이슈마다 업무 설명이 끝난 후, '스토리 포인트'를 설정하게 되는데, '스토리 포인트'는 누가 해당 업무를 처리하는지 관계없이 해당 업무를 처리하는데 얼마큼 시간이 필요할지 생각하여 투표하고, 의견을 종합하여 최종 스토리 포인트를 결정합니다. 저희 팀은 'Planning Poker'를 이용하여 스토리 포인트를 측정합니다.\n\n\n\n 이슈마다 '스토리 포인트' 할당이 끝나면, 이슈 담당자를 정합니다. 너무 많은 스토리를 가져오거나, 속도를 과대 평가하거나, 스프린트에서 완료할 수 없는 작업을 가져오지 말아야 합니다. 품질 또는 기술적 부채를 잊지 말아야 할 점입니다.\n\"자신 또는 팀이 실패할 수밖에 없는 계획을 세우지 말아야 합니다.\"\n\n\n\n 이슈 담당자까지 지정이 완료되고 나면 프로젝트 관리자는 달성가능한 '스토리 포인트'가 할당된 지 확인하고 스프린트를 시작합니다.\n데일리 스크럼\n데일리 스크럽은 핵심 팀(제품 소유자, 개발자 및 스크럼 마스터)이 매일 아침 참여하는 회의입니다. 진행률을 논의하고 업무 진행을 방해하는 요소를 파악하기 위한 짧은 회의입니다. 참석자들이 회의에 서서 참여하면 회의가 짧게 진행되기 때문에 '스탠드업 미팅'이라고도 불려집니다. 데일리 스크럼에서 중요한 점은 보고 형식이 되면 안 됩니다. 모두가 팀의 상태와 진행률을 알 수 있도록, \"우리\"라는 개념을 강조합니다.\n \n저희 팀은 오전 10시에 회의를 진행하며 아래의 두 가지를 위주로 이야기하고 있습니다.\n어제 어떤 작업을 했습니다.\n오늘 무슨 일을 하고 있습니다.\n어떤 이슈가 나를 방해합니다. (위 두 개의 답변을 하며 함께 공유합니다)\n 보고 형식으로 팀장님께 이야기하는 것이 아닌, 참여자들끼리 상황 공유를 하고 도움을 줄 수 있는 경우 의견을 냅니다. 또한 회의가 끝난 후 함께 문제를 해결하는 시간을 가지기도 합니다.\n \n스프린트 리뷰\n저희 팀은 스프린트를 4주 단위로 하고 있으며, 스프린트 리뷰와 회고는 월 마지막주 화요일에 하고 있습니다. 스프린트 리뷰 포맷은 아래와 같습니다.\n \nsprint review\n\n\n스프린트 리뷰는 스프린트 동안 달성하고자 했던 목표와 \"결과물\"에 중점을 두고 리뷰를 합니다. 발표자는 스프린트 기간 동안 작업한 내용을 시각적으로 보여주고, 팀원은 피드백과 KPT (Keep, Problem, Try)를 작성해 줍니다.\n저희가 하는 것 중, 특이점은 \"Story Point Check\" 항목이 있는데, 스프린트 회고 때 나온 의견의 결과물로 스토리 포인트를 잘 설정하기 위하여 스프린트 리뷰 때, 설정한 스토리 포인트와 실제 본인이 작업하며 느낀 스토리 포인트에 대한 확인을 하고 있습니다. (선택적으로 하고 싶은 사람만 하고 있습니다)\n \n스프린트 회고 ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n스프린트 회고는 업무 관련된 회고가 아닌, 스프린트를 진행하면서 작업방법, 프로세스, 환경 등 교훈을 정리하고 팀 프로세스 개선을 위한 활동입니다.\n \n스프린트가 성숙해지기 위해서는 회고가 가장 중요하다고 생각합니다. 개인적으로 팀이 스크럼에 잘 적응할 수 있었던 이유는 스프린트 회고 문화를 잘 정착시켰기 때문이라 생각됩니다.\n \n직책자(팀장/PM)의 주도로 회고를 하지 않는다.\n회고 진행자는 팀원이 돌아가며 진행한다.\n팀원들의 적극적인 참여가 필요합니다.\n \n제가 생각하는 저희 팀이 회고를 잘 적응할 수 있었던 이유입니다. 한국의 문화적 특성상 직책자가 주도하는 회의에서는 자유로운 토론이 되지 않는 경우가 있습니다. 보통 스크럼 마스터가 회고를 진행하는데, 한 명의 고정된 진행자가 있을 경우, 팀원의 참여도가 점점 떨어질 수 있습니다. 팀원이 돌아가며 회고 진행을 할 경우, 진행자는 회고를 준비하고 이끌어 가기 위해 학습합니다. 이런 경험이 쌓이며 성숙된 문화가 정착되고 있습니다.\n회고 툴은 회고 진행자가 전적으로 준비해오고 있습니다. 고정된 툴을 사용해야 하는 것도 아닙니다. 회고 툴을 사용한 것 중, 제일 좋았던 툴은 retrotool 입니다.\n스프린트 회고\n\n\n회고 진행자는 retrotool 에서 아래 칼럼을 생성하여 회고를 준비합니다.\n[잘한 점/성공의 원인] : 칭찬하거나, 스프린트 진행 중 긍정적이었던 부분\n[부족한 점/장애물] : 부족하거나, 스프린트 진행 중 방해 요소\n[개선 방법]\n[개선방법(누적)] : 누적된 개선 방법 (문화로 정착할 경우 졸업)\n진행 방법은 아래와 같습니다.\n절차\n내용\n시간\n\n\n아이스브레이킹\n팀원과의 대화\n5 ~ 10분\n\n\n개선방법 (누적) 공유\n \n \n\n\n잘한점\n잘한점 작성\n5분\n\n\n공유\n작성 내용 확인 및 공유\n \n\n\n부족한점\n부족한점 작성\n5분\n\n\n공유\n작성 내용 확인 및 공유\n \n\n\n개선점\n개선점 작성\n5분\n\n\n공유\n개선점 공유 및 평가\n \n\n\n\n \n 회고에 자유로운 대화를 하기 위하여 회고에 앞서 아이스브레이킹을 진행합니다. 밸런스 게임이나 이상형 월드컵 등으로 자유로운 분위기로 대화를 할 수 있는 환경을 준비합니다.\n \n \n 지금까지 누적된 개선방법(누적)을 공유하고, 이번 스프린트에 잘한 점을 '5분'동안 각자 작성합니다. retrotool 툴은 포스트잇 형태로 익명으로 작성 가능합니다. 업무 내용 외 스프린트를 진행하며, 칭찬하고 싶은 사람이나 좋았던 것에 대한 작성을 합니다. 팀원들이 작성한 내용을 보고, 공감이 될 경우 포스트잇을 클릭(LIKE)합니다. 회고 진행자는 공감이 많이 된 순으로 작성된 내용에 대해서 팀원들의 의견을 듣는 시간을 가집니다. 이때, 꼭 작성자가 본인이 쓴 내용을 이야기하지 않아도 됩니다. 부족한 점도 좋은 점과 동일하게 작성하고 공유합니다.\n\n\n 잘한 점과 부족한 점에 대한 공유가 끝나면, 팀원들이 '5분'간 각자 개선점을 작성합니다. 개선점 작성이 끝나면 진행자는 개선점을 공유합니다. 누적된 개선 사항 중, 이미 문화로 정착되었거나 불필요하다고 느낄 경우 '졸업'을 시키고, 새로운 개선 사항을 추가해 줍니다. 회고에서 나온 개선사항은 언제든 팀원들이 볼 수 있는 공간에 정리해 둡니다. (저희의 경우 주간회의록 제일 상단에 정리해 둡니다.)\n \n모든 회고가 완료되면, 회고 진행자는 회고록을 작성합니다.  \n \n\n\n \n스프린트 종료\n프로젝트 관리자는 지정된 날짜에 스프린트를 종료를 팀원에 알리고 종료를 합니다.\n그 후, 새로운 스프린트를 작성하고, 플래닝을 준비합니다.\n \n맺음말\n스크럼 이론이 존재하고, 이를 지원하는 Tool로 지원을 받을 수 있습니다. 중요한 점은 협업하는 팀이 목표를 달성하기 위하여 사용하는 방법론이므로 정답이 존재하지 않는다는 것입니다. 회사마다 팀마다 맞는 문화를 만들어 협업 및 업무에 도움이 되는 방법을 찾아가는 것이 좋습니다.\n \n참고 자료\n용어 설명\n백로그(Backlog) : 프로젝트 관리, 소프트웨어 개발, 업무 관리 등 다양한 분야에서 사용되는 용어로, 완료되지 않은 작업 항목들의 리스트나 목록을 가리킵니다.\n스크럼 마스터 : 스크럼의 전문가로 스크럼 프레임워크를 따르도록 보장합니다\n \n참고 문서\n스크럼과 스프린트\n스크럼 설명 - Jira software\n스프린트 계획\n데일리 스크럼\n스크럼 마스터\n회고",

그렇지도 않았다. 일명 신자유주의, 미국은 막대한 자본을 유럽 시장에 투자했고 유럽과 미국의 시장 경제는 얽히고설켜 있었다. 유럽은 미국을 벗어나지 못했고 미국의 불황이 유럽의 불황으로 이어지는 등 여러 문제가 발생하자, 그 대안으로 유럽은 독자적인 통화체제를 마련하고자 했다.\n미국의 영향력을 차단하고, 유럽의 위상을 새롭게 하며, 세계 경제에서 보다 주도적인 지위를 구축하겠다는 생각이었다. 유럽은 1991년부터 통합 화폐를 준비했고 1999년 유로화가 등장한다.\n화폐로 똘똘 뭉치는 시대, \n우리는 IMF를 맞았다\n유로화가 등장할 무렵, 우리나라의 상황은 좋지 않았다. 1997년 3월, 대한민국 외환위기의 시발점인 한보사태가 일어난다. 4월에는 삼미와 진로, 5월에는 대동과 한신공영, 7월에는 기아자동차, 10월에는 쌍방울, 11월에는 해태, 12월에는 고려증권과 한라그룹 등 국내 굴지의 기업들이 줄줄이 쓰러져 나갔다.\n경제 위기는 우리나라 뿐만이 아니었다. 아시아가 흔들리기 시작했다. 1997년 7월부터는 태국이 흔들렸다. 태국의 화폐인 바트 환율이 20% 이상 떨어진 것이다. 153억 달러의 경상수지 적자가 문제였다. 바트 화폐의 평가 절하가 계속되었고, 태국 정부는 8월 들어 IMF(국제통화기금)에 지원을 요청한다.\n바트화 가치가 갑자기 떨어지면서 인도네시아, 말레이시아, 필리핀, 한국 등으로 파장이 확대됐다. 아시아 각국의 화폐 가치가 급락하고, 외국에서 투자한 돈도 빠르게 빠져나가며 아시아 외환 시장이 마비되었다. 이러한 여파 가운데 1997년 말 우리나라도 외환위기를 맞게 된다.\n이에 반해, 1990년대 중반 미국은 캐나다와 멕시코를 끌어들여 북미자유무역협정(NAFTA)을 체결해 ‘달러블록’을 강화했다. 각국의 통화를 미국 달러에 연동하거나, 달러와 밀접한 관계를 맺는 경제정책을 펼쳐나간 것이다. 같은 맥락에서 유로화의 등장은 ‘유로블록'으로 해석되었다. 아시아만 ‘통화블록'이 없으니 아시아의 처지는 위태로울 수밖에 없었다.\n유로화에 대응한 한중일 공동화폐?\n이러한 변화에 민감하게 반응했던 나라는 일본이었다. 1997년 말 일본은 아시아통화기금(AMF)을 제안했다. 일본은 미국이 주도하는 IMF가 동아시아 경제 위기 극복에 도움이 되지 못한다고 비판했고, 그 대안으로 일본을 중심으로 한 엔화의 국제화, 동아시아 기금 마련, 아시아 금융 블록 등을 제안했다.\n당시 일본은 한국을 포함한 신흥공업국가(NICs)에 엄청난 자본투자를 하고 있었기 때문에 불가능한 발상이 아니었다. 하지만 미국은 강력하게 반발했다. 달러를 벗어나서 독자적인 엔화 시스템을 구축한다는 것은 미국의 동아시아 패권에 문제가 생길 수 있는 발상이기 때문이다.\n일본이 주도하는 아시아 경제? 한국은 물론이고 중국 또한 결코 반길 수 없었다. 오랜 역사적 은원관계가 청산되지 않은 상황에서 일본 주도의 아시아 통화블록은 또 다른 제국주의로 해석될 수밖에 없었다. 더구나 2000년대 이후 중국은 한국과 일본을 추월해 압도적인 경제성장을 이어갔기 때문에 ‘한중일 FTA’, ‘한중일공동화폐’ 등 여러 아이디어는 말 그대로 아이디어에 멈추고 말았다.\n한중일의 경제 규모를 합치면 미국이나 유럽을 압도할 수준임에도 불구하고 왜 지금까지 아시아는 유럽처럼 연합하지 못했을까? 해답은 통화가 아니라 역사에 있다.\n반백 년의 고민,\n유로화는 단순한 경제적 결합이 아니다\n20세기 전반 유럽은 두 차례의 세계대전을 경험했다. 영국, 프랑스, 독일 그리고 러시아로 나뉘어 정말이지 오랫동안 싸워왔다. 프랑스의 경제학자이자 정치인인 장 모네는 유럽이 어떻게 해야 평화에 도달할 수 있을지 고민했다. 민족주의와 제국주의가 유럽을 전쟁터로 만들었다고 생각했던 장 모네는 민족 국가가 아닌 유럽 공동체, 식민지가 아닌 공동 시장을 주장했다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n만약 유럽 국가들이 한 번 더 서로에 대항하여 스스로를 보호하려 한다면, 다시 한번 막강한 군대를 만드는 것이 필요할 것이다(...) 우리는 그것이 얼마나 돈이 드는지 안다. 사회 개혁은 군비지출 압력으로 제약받거나 지연될 것이다. 유럽은 또 한 번 공포 속에서 창출되게 될 것이다(...) 번영과 사회적 진보를 누리기 위해서 유럽의 국가들은 연방이거나 혹은 그들을 단일 경제 단위로 만들어 줄 수 있는 ‘유럽 단일체(European entity)’를 구성해야 한다.\n– 장모네, 《유럽 통합의 아버지 장 모네 회고록⟫ 중.css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n일명 모네 플랜. ‘이익을 두고 다투는 것이 아니라 더 큰 이익을 위해 협력한다’라는 그의 비전은 전쟁의 악몽에서 벗어나고픈 유럽인들에게 큰 영향을 미쳤다. 프랑스 대통령 드골과 독일의 총리 아데나워는 유럽 공동체를 이루기 위해 적극적인 화해 협력 정책을 추진했고, 영국도 동참하면서 1950년대 유럽철강공동체(ECSC)가 등장하게 된다. 철강은 산업혁명의 핵심 자원으로 오랜 기간 분쟁의 원인이었다. 하지만 이제는 협력의 도구가 된 것이다.\n협력은 협력의 역사를 낳았다. 냉전이 붕괴되자 서유럽은 낙후된 동유럽을 품으며 유럽 공동체를 확대해 갔고, 여러 단계를 거쳐 오늘날 유럽연합(EU)으로 발전했다. 유로화는 이러한 노력의 결정체라고 할 수 있다. 파시즘이나 나치즘 같은 극단적인 민족주의를 제어하고 미국을 견제할 수 있는 독자적인 시장을 구축하려는 시도이기도 했다.\n유로화가 도입된 1999년 유럽의 경제는 2.8% 성장, 다음해에는 3.5% 성장했다. 화폐간  거래비용이 감소하고, 유로화를 쓰는 국가 사이의 거래가 더욱 활발해졌다. 국가간 환율 불확실성이 사라지면서 유럽은 하나의 시장이 되었고 그만큼 성장이 가속화되었기 때문이다.\n그렇다고 유로화가 만능은 아니었다. 2007년 서브프라임 모기지 사태로 촉발된 미국발 금융 위기가 일어났을 때 유럽의 경제지도자들은 유로화를 기반으로 한 유럽 경제가 미국의 위기에 영향을 받지 않을 것으로 생각했다. 하지만 그렇지 않았다. 미국발 금융 파생상품은 유럽과도 긴밀히 얽혀 있었기 때문에 여파가 굉장했다. \n또한 장점이 곧 단점. 유로화의 등장 이후 유럽중앙은행은 단일 통화 정책을 실시했고, 개별 국가의 경제 상황에 맞춘 통화 정책은 불가능해졌다. 현실적으로 존재하는 국가간 격차를 해결하기 어려워진 것이다.\n중요한 사실은 앞으로 유럽이, 유로화가 어떻게 될 것인가보다는 우리가, 우리나라가, 우리나라를 둘러싼 동북아시아가 어떻게 될 것인가이다. 그들이 지난 수십 년간 평화를 도모하고 새로운 길을 개척하는 동안 어쩌면 우리는 반복된 갈등의 수렁에서 헤매고 있었던 것은 아닐까. 유로화는 단순한 경제적 결합이 아닌 깊은 역사적 경험과 고뇌의 산물이다. 이제 우리도 그러한 노력을 할 때가 되었다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0 8px;cursor:pointer;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;color:var(--adaptiveGrey700);}\n.css-1dzrkjz{width:16px;margin-right:8px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;}\n.svg-icon-wrapper{position:relative;display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;}.svg-icon-wrapper >.svg-icon:empty+.svg-icon-fallback{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}.svg-icon{color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);display:inline-block;width:24px;height:24px;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon svg,.svg-icon img{display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon--hide{display:none;}.svg-icon-fallback{position:absolute;left:0;right:0;top:0;z-index:z-index(hidden);visibility:hidden;display:block;width:100%;height:100%;}.svg-icon-fallback--show{visibility:visible;z-index:inherit;}\n참고자료 \n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호 조수희",

용어\n금융투자소득세\n이번 주 경제 용어는 노후에 잘 살기 위해 필요한 정보예요.\n\n.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n금융투자소득세(금투세)는 주식·채권·펀드·파생상품 등 금융 투자로 얻은 양도 소득에 대해 부과하는 세금을 말해요.\n\n\n금융투자소득세는 2020년에 기획재정부가 소득세법 개정안을 발의하면서 시작되었고, 2023년부터 시행될 예정이었는데요. 국내 증권 시장 활성화 목적으로 2년 유예된 상태입니다. 만약 올해 여야 합의가 없다면, 2025년 1월부터 과세될 전망이에요.\n금투세의 기본 취지는 모든 금융 투자 상품에서 발생한 수익에 대해 과세하겠다는 것입니다. 뒤죽박죽으로 섞여 있던 금융 투자에 일괄적인 세금을 매긴다는 건 좋은 의미입니다. 이는 금융 투자 시장의 투명성을 높이고, .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}조세 형평성을 강화할 수 있으니까요. 다만 기존에 비과세였던 국내 주식과 채권 투자에 과세가 추가되면서 개인 투자자들의 부담이 늘어난다는 우려가 있습니다.\n금융투자소득세에 대해 좀더 자세히 정리하면 아래와 같아요.\n.css-hokoge{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

'.';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n금융투자소득세란\n주식·채권·펀드·파생상품 등 금융상품에 투자하여 실현된 소득에 세금을 매기는 것을 말합니다. 원래 각 금융 상품별로 과세 체계가 각각 달랐는데요. 이 과세 체계를 새롭게 정립하여 만든 세금입니다.\n\n금융투자소득세 세율\n과세표준에 따라 금융투자 소득이 3억 원 이하일 경우 22%(금투세 20%+지방소득세 2%)의 세율, 3억 원을 초과하면 27.5%(금투세 25%+지방소득세 2.5%)의 합산 세율이 적용됩니다.\n\n금융투자소득세 주요 특징\n➀ 손익통산, ➁ 기본공제 적용, ➂ 결손금 이월공제 가능 등이 있어요.\n➀ 손익통산: 투자 이익과 손실을 합쳐서 계산 후 남은 ‘순이익’에 대해서 과세함을 의미하고요.\n➁ 기본공제 적용: 연 5,000만 원(1그룹)과 연 250만 원(2그룹)으로 나눠서 투자자가 얻은 금융투자소득 중 일부를 공제해줍니다. 금융투자소득세 기본공제를 받기 위해서는 반드시 투자자가 금융 회사에 신청해야 하는데요. 기본공제 한도 내에서 여러 금융 회사에 나눠서 신청할 수 있어요.\n\n\n1그룹 (기본공제 연 5,000만 원) : 코스피, 코스닥, 코넥스 상장주식, 국내주식형 공모펀드, 국내주식형 ETF, K-OTC 중소/중견기업 주식\n2그룹 (기본공제 연 250만 원) : 1그룹에 해당되지 않는 금융투자소득. 상장 및 비상장주식의 장외거래 등, 채권등(조건부자본증권, CP, CD, 전단채 등), 집합투자증권/집합투자기구(1그룹 제외), 파생결합증권(ELS, DLS, ETN, ELW 등), 해외주식, 자본시장법상 투자계약증권, 파생상품(선물, 옵션, 선도, 스왑 등)\n\n* 참고 자료 링크 (출처: 신한투자증권)\n\n➂ 결손금 이월공제 가능: 투자 손실이 이익보다 클 때, ‘금융투자 결손금’이 발생했다고 하는데요. 결손금이 발생하면 기본공제 등 세금 혜택을 받지 못합니다. 그래서 향후 5년 간 수익이 발생하는 해로 결손금을 이월하여 그 해의 소득에서 공제받을 수 있도록 하는 거예요. 이를 통해 전체적인 세금 부담을 줄일 수 있게 됩니다.\n\n기존에 내지 않던 세금 발생\n기존에는 내지 않던 세금을 내야 합니다. 지금까지 국내 투자 활성화를 위해 국내 주식과 국내 주식형 ETF·펀드(1그룹에 해당) 수익은 비과세였습니다. 또한 채권투자(2그룹에 해당) 수익에 대해서도 비과세였죠. 하지만 금투세가 시행되면 모두 과세 대상이 됩니다.\n파생결합증권과 펀드 등 수익에 대해서도 세금을 지금보다 더 많이 내야 하는데요. 배당소득세에서 금투세로 바뀌면서, 15.4%에서 22~27.5%(지방세 포함)로 세율이 오르게 됩니다.\n\n\n금융투자소득세 도입으로 인해 올해 연말까지 국내 주식 시장의 변동성이 높아질 수 있다는 우려가 있습니다. 세금 부담을 피하기 위해 국내 증시를 이탈하려는 큰손들의 주식 매도 현상이 심화될 수 있고, 내년에 과세되는 양도 차익 규모를 줄이기 위해 국내 주식을 매도하는 사람들이 늘어날 수 있기 때문입니다. 이런 분위기 속에서 아무래도 개인 투자자들의 투자 심리는 위축될 수 있겠습니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}“딸 위해 가입한 펀드 팔 수밖에”…연말정산도 금투세 도입땐 손해\n(매일경제 2024.6.20)\n#5년 전에 딸 아이 이름으로 해외주식에 투자하는 어린이 펀드에 가입했던 김 모씨는 금융투자소득세가 시행되기 전인 올해에 펀드를 환매할 예정이다. 그동안 신경 안 쓰고 살았는데 금융투자소득세가 도입되면 일정 기준 이상 수익에 대한 연말공제 인적공제 혜택이 사라진다는 얘기를 들었기 때문이다.\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}오랫동안 가지고 있던 펀드라 100만 원 넘는 수익이 났는데 인적공제를 못받아 세금을 더 토해내느니 일단 올해 환매하는 게 낫겠다는 생각이다. 다만 당시 은행에서 펀드 가입할 때 이것저것 서류 작성할 게 너무 많아서 이번에는 펀드 환매 후 다른 투자를 할까 고민하고 있다.\n내년 금융투자소득세 시행을 앞두고 하반기 펀드 시장에 혼란이 불가피해졌다. 당초에는 투자자들이 국내 시장에서 이탈할 것이란 우려가 컸다면 이제는 국내주식 뿐만 아니라 채권, 해외주식, 펀드 모든 자산에 대해 연내 매도와 환매가 대거 일어날 우려가 커지고 있다. (중략)\n\n\n여러분, “나는 주식 투자로 연간 5,000만 원 못 벌어 들이니까 금융투자소득세와 상관없는 사람”이라 생각하시면 큰일입니다. 연간 금융소득이 5,000만 원 이하인 가구도 ‘실질적으로’ 내는 세금이 늘어날 가능성이 있으니까요.\n금투세가 시행되면, 일반 투자자들이 더이상 부양가족 인적공제 혜택을 받지 못하게 될 수 있다는 것이 주목해야 할 점인데요. 어떤 이유 때문인지 좀더 자세히 살펴볼게요.\n그동안 연말정산 인적공제는 배우자, 직계존비속, 형제자매까지 대상이 매우 넓어 많은 근로소득자들이 연말정산 때 1~3명의 인적공제를 받아왔어요. 부양가족 1인당 150만 원씩 인적공제를 받을 수 있는데, ‘인적공제 대상인 부양가족 구성원은 연 소득이 100만 원을 넘지 않아야 한다’는 중요한 요건이 있습니다.\n그런데 부양가족이 국내 주식과 채권, 펀드 등에 투자해 연간 100만 원 이상 이익을 얻으면 더이상 인적공제 혜택을 받을 수 없게 됩니다. 금투세가 도입되면 2,000만 원 이하의 금융투자 수익도 과세 대상에 포함되면서 ‘소득’으로 잡히게 되거든요. 즉, 그동안 부양가족으로 인적공제를 받을 수 있었던 요건에서 이탈되는 거예요.\n이렇게 되면 가정 주부나 자녀분들은 금융 투자를 하지 말라는 의미로도 해석될 수 있습니다. 가정 주부나 자녀 명의로 주식 계좌를 만들어 주는 경제 교육도 어려워지고, 대학생 자녀들에게도 함부로 주식 투자를 하면 안 된다고 말해야 하는 상황이 발생할 수 있습니다. 그래서 이게 가장 큰 문제입니다. 자산을 늘릴 수 있는 사다리가 또 한 번 사라지는 거니까요.\n이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해서는 금투세 설계가 적정한지 검토해야 한다는 목소리가 나오고 있어요. 또한 바뀌는 세법에 대해 정부 차원에서 금융 투자 교육을 강화하는 등의 노력도 병행해야 할 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n금융소득종합과세: 금융소득(은행 예적금의 이자소득, 주식의 배당소득 등)을 종합소득(사업소득, 근로소득, 연금소득 등)에 합쳐서 세금을 매기는 제도. 개인별 연간 금융 소득의 합계액이 2,000만 원을 초과하는 경우에 금융소득종합과세를 적용하고, 누진세율이 적용돼요.\n양도소득세: 부동산이나 금융상품을 다른 사람에게 팔 때 생기는 세금. 개인이 토지, 건물, 분양권 등 부동산에 대한 권리를 양도하거나 주식, 채권 등 금융상품의 양도함으로 인해 생기는 이익에 세금이 매겨지게 됩니다.\nISA 계좌: 개인종합자산관리 계좌. ISA 계좌에서 발생하는 금융투자 소득은 200만 원(서민형 400만 원)까지 비과세되고, 초과분 소득은 9%의 세율로 분리과세(지방소득세 별도)되므로 일반 계좌에 비해 절세가 가능해요. 더 자세한 내용은 [여기]에서 확인할 수 있어요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",

LH, SH 등이 분양하는 공공주택에 청약을 넣으면 납입 총액이 많은 사람을 우선해서 뽑는데요. 원래는 납입 총액을 계산할 때 한 달에 최대 10만 원까지만 인정됐지만, 앞으로는 25만 원까지 인정됩니다.\n\n🔗  콘텐츠 더 보기\n\n2024년 달라지는 청약제도 4가지 \n사전청약 제도가 사라져요 \n청약통장 월 납입 인정 한도가 올라가요 \n(위 콘텐츠들은 토스앱에서 볼 수 있습니다)\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nGraphic 조수희",
