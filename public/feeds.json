        "content:encodedSnippet": "In November, we introduced C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot as a Private Preview, focusing on partnering with customers to tackle one of the common, taxing challenges for C++ development: refactoring at scale. Since then, we’ve listened to feedback and refined our tooling to make wide-sweeping C++ edits easier.\n“With C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio, we’ve seen noticeably better overall results, with fewer errors and faster processing on large projects.” – Software engineer (from our Private Preview)\n\nWe’re excited to announce that C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot are now available to all C++ users in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nC++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot\nRefactoring at scale is a time-consuming and error-prone process for C++ developers. Traditionally, developers relied on manual searches and incremental edits across multiple files to accomplish these tasks.\nWith these C++ code editing tools, Copilot goes beyond file searches and unlocks greater context-aware refactoring that enables changes across multiple files and sections.\nThe C++ code editing tools provide rich context for any symbol in your project, allowing Copilot agent mode to:\nView all references across your codebase\nUnderstand metadata such as type, declaration, and scope\nVisualize class inheritance hierarchies\nTrace function call chains\n\nThis helps Copilot accomplish complex editing tasks, reducing the traditionally manual effort required to perform refactoring tasks by improving the accuracy and speed of these operations.\nGetting started\nTo get started with these tools\nOpen your C++ project and ensure you have IntelliSense enabled\nNavigate to Tools > Options and turn on the visibility of the tools via GitHub > Copilot settings. You may need to close and re-open your solution for the tools to populate after this step.\n\nEnable any or all tools via the “Tools” icon in Copilot Chat\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Tool names and UI may evolve during the Public Preview and are subject to change.\nExample scenarios\nAll examples below were showcased using bullet3, an open-source C++ physics simulation engine.\n1. Add additional functionality to existing functions\nAs applications evolve, you often need to enhance existing functions without breaking current behavior. This can include adding logging or performance metrics.\nThese tools help the agent quickly identify all relevant references, ensuring complete and accurate updates for feature additions.\n\n2. Improve memory management\nInefficient memory handling leads to performance bottlenecks, excessive copies, and unclear ownership semantics. When making these updates, these tools can help identify all relevant references and ensure all type changes are updated to verify code compiles without errors.\n3. Visualizing unfamiliar code\nC++ code can often have intricate structures and dependency mapping. In a large, unfamiliar codebase, onboarding to a task can often be very time-consuming.\nThe C++ tools can help identify all relevant class structures and symbol information to produce a visualization of a given set of C++ symbols in a library or file, easing your onboarding process.\nBest practices\nChoose the right model for the job: Models that are optimized for tool-calling will perform best with our tools. To learn more about the models available, please visit these docs: AI model comparison – GitHub Docs\nBe specific with prompts: Being specific with prompts and breaking vague tasks into clear intent and context will improve the tool calling and performance. Specify symbols explicitly when possible.\nShare your feedback\nWe’d love to hear feedback on how we can improve the C++ tooling experience. Please report problems or suggest improvements through the Visual Studio feedback icon.\n\nWhat’s next\nWe’re looking to evolve our integration with Visual Studio tools and expand this support to other Copilot surfaces, like Visual Studio Code, to further empower agent-driven edits for C++.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The 2025 Typed Python Survey, conducted by contributors from JetBrains, Meta, and the broader Python typing community, offers a comprehensive look at the current state of Python’s type system and developer tooling. With 1,241 responses (a 15% increase from last year), the survey captures the evolving sentiment, challenges, and opportunities around Python typing in the open-source ecosystem. In this blog we’ll cover a summary of the key findings and trends from this year’s results.\nWho Responded?\nThe survey was initially distributed on official social media accounts by the survey creators, and subsequently shared organically across further platforms including Reddit, email newsletters, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitter. When respondents were asked which platform they heard about the survey from, Reddit emerged as the most effective channel, but significant engagement also came from email newsletters and Mastodon, reflecting the diverse spaces where Python developers connect and share knowledge.\nThe respondent pool was predominantly composed of developers experienced with Python and typing. Nearly half reported over a decade of Python experience, and another third had between five and 10 years. While there was representation from newcomers, the majority of participants brought substantial expertise to their responses. Experience with type hints was similarly robust, with most respondents having used them for several years and only a small minority indicating no experience with typing.\nTyping Adoption and Attitudes\nThe survey results reveal that Python’s type hinting system has become a core part of development for most engineers. An impressive 86% of respondents report that they “always” or “often” use type hints in their Python code, a figure that remains consistent with last year’s Typed Python survey. \nFor the first time this year the survey also asked participants to indicate how many years of experience they have with Python and with Python typing. We found that adoption of typing is similar across all experience levels, but there are some interesting nuances:\nDevelopers with 5–10 years of Python experience are the most enthusiastic adopters, with 93% reporting regularly using type hints.\nAmong the most junior developers (0–2 years of experience), adoption is slightly lower at 83%. Possible reasons for this could be the learning curve for newcomers (repeatedly mentioned in later survey questions).\nFor senior developers (10+ years of experience), adoption was the lowest of all cohorts, with  only 80% reporting using them always or often. Reasons for this drop are unclear, it could reflect more experienced python developers having gotten used to writing Python without type hints before they were supported, or possibly they are more likely to work on larger or legacy codebases that are difficult to migrate.\nPercent of respondents who use types “often” or “always,” segmented by years of Python experience.\nOverall, the data shows that type hints are widely embraced by the Python community, with strong support from engineers at all experience levels. However, we should note there may be some selection bias at play here, as it’s possible developers who are more familiar with types and use them more often are also more likely to be interested in taking a survey about it.\nWhy Developers Love Python Typing\nWhen asked what developers loved about the Python type system there were some mixed reactions, with a number of responses just stating, “nothing” (note this was an optional question). This indicates the presence of some strong negative opinions towards the type system among a minority of Python users. The majority of responses were positive, with the following themes emerging prominently:\nOptionality and Gradual Adoption: The optional nature of the type system and the ability to adopt it incrementally into existing projects are highly valued, allowing flexibility in development.\nImproved Readability and Documentation: Type hints serve as in-code documentation, making code clearer and easier to read, understand, and reason about for both the author and other developers, especially in larger codebases.\nEnhanced Tooling and IDE Support: The type system significantly improves IDE features like autocomplete/IntelliSense, jump-to-definition, and inline type hints, leading to a better developer experience.\nBug Prevention and Code Correctness: It helps catch errors and subtle bugs earlier during development or refactoring, increasing confidence and leading to more robust and reliable code.\nFlexibility and Features: Respondents appreciate the flexibility, expressiveness, and powerful features of the system, including protocols, generics (especially the new syntax), and the ability to inspect annotations at runtime for use with libraries like Pydantic/FastAPI.\nSample of responses to the question, “What do you love about Python Typing?”\nChallenges and Pain Points\nIn addition to assessing positive sentiment towards Python typing, we also asked respondents what challenges and pain points they face. With over 800 responses to the question, “What is the hardest part about using the Python type system?” the following themes were identified:\nThird-Party Library/Framework Support: Many respondents cited the difficulty of integrating types with untyped, incomplete, or incorrect type annotations in third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django).\nComplexity of Advanced Features: Advanced concepts such as generics, TypeVar (including co/contravariance), callables/decorators, and complex/nested types were frequently mentioned as difficult to understand or express.\nTooling and Ecosystem Fragmentation: The ecosystem is seen as chaotic, with inconsistencies between different type checkers (like Mypy and Pyright), slow performance of tools like Mypy, and a desire for an official, built-in type checker.\nLack of Enforcement and Runtime Guarantees: The fact that typing is optional and is not enforced at runtime or by the Python interpreter makes it harder to convince others to use it, enforce its consistent use, and fully trust the type hints.\nVerbosity and Code Readability: The necessary type hints, especially for complex structures, can be verbose, make the code less readable, and feel non-Pythonic.\nDealing with Legacy/Dynamic Code: It is hard to integrate typing into old, untyped codebases, particularly when they use dynamic Python features that do not play well with static typing.\nType System Limitations and Evolution: The type system is perceived as incomplete or less expressive than languages like TypeScript, and its rapid evolution means syntax and best practices are constantly changing.\nMost Requested Features\nA little less than half of respondents had suggestions for what they thought was missing from the Python type system, the most commonly requested features being:\nMissing Features From TypeScript and Other Languages: Many respondents requested features inspired by TypeScript, such as Intersection types (like the & operator), Mapped and Conditional types, Utility types (like Pick, Omit, keyof, and typeof), and better Structural typing for dictionaries/dicts (e.g., more flexible TypedDict or anonymous types).\nRuntime Type Enforcement and Performance: A significant number of developers desire optional runtime type enforcement or guarantees, as well as performance optimizations (JIT/AOT compilation) based on the type hints provided.\nBetter Generics and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs): Requests include features like higher-kinded types (HKT), improved support for TypeVarTuple (e.g., bounds and unpacking), better generics implementation, and official support for algebraic data types (e.g., Result, Option, or Rust-like enums/sum types).\nImproved Tooling, Consistency, and Syntax: Developers asked for an official/built-in type checker that is fast and consistent, a less verbose syntax for common patterns like nullable types (? instead of | None) and callables, and better support/documentation for complex types (like nested dicts, NumPy/Pandas arrays).\nHandling of Complex/Dynamic Patterns: Specific missing capabilities include better support for typing function wrappers/decorators (e.g., using ParamSpec effectively), being able to type dynamic attributes (like those added by Django/ORMs), and improved type narrowing and control flow analysis.\nTooling Trends\nThe developer tooling landscape for Python typing continues to evolve, with both established and emerging tools shaping how engineers work.\nMypy remains the most widely used type checker, with 58% of respondents reporting using it. While this represents a slight dip from 61% in last year’s survey, Mypy still holds a dominant position in the ecosystem. At the same time, new Rust-based type checkers like Pyrefly, Ty, and Zuban are quickly gaining traction, now used by over 20% of survey participants collectively.\nThe top six most popular answers to the question, “What type checking tools do your projects use (select all that apply)?”\nWhen it comes to development environments, VS Code leads the pack as the most popular IDE among Python developers, followed by PyCharm and (Neo)vim/vim. The use of type checking tools within IDEs also mimics the popularity of the IDE themselves, with VS Code’s default (Pylance/Pyright) and PyCharm’s built-in support being the first and third most popular options respectively.\nHow Developers Learn and Get Help\nWhen it comes to learning about Python typing and getting help, developers rely on a mix of official resources, community-driven content, and AI-powered tools, a similar learning landscape to what we saw in last year’s survey.\nTop six responses to the question, “How do you learn Python typing (select all that apply)?”\nOfficial documentation remains the go-to resource for most developers. The majority of respondents reported learning about Python typing through the official docs, with 865 citing it as their primary source for learning and 891 turning to it for help. Python’s dedicated typing documentation and type checker-specific docs are also heavily used, showing that well-maintained, authoritative resources are still highly valued.\nBlog posts have climbed in popularity, now ranking as the second most common way developers learn about typing, up from third place last year. Online tutorials, code reviews, and YouTube videos also play a significant role.\nCommunity platforms are gaining traction as sources for updates and new features. Reddit, in particular, has become a key channel for discovering new developments in the type system, jumping from fifth to third place as a source for news. Email newsletters, podcasts, and Mastodon are also on the rise.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are now a notable part of the help-seeking landscape. Over 400 respondents reported using LLM chat tools, and nearly 300 use in-editor LLM suggestions when working with Python typing. \nOpportunities and Next Steps\nThe 2025 Python Typing Survey highlights the Python community’s sustained adoption of typing features and tools to support their usage. It also points to clear opportunities for continued growth and improvement, including:\nIncreasing library coverage: One of the most consistent requests from the community is for broader and deeper type annotation coverage in popular libraries. Expanding type hints across widely used packages will make static typing more practical and valuable for everyone.\nImproving documentation: While official documentation remains the top resource, there’s a strong appetite for more discoverable and accessible learning materials. Leveraging channels like newsletters, blog posts, and Reddit can help surface new features, best practices, and real-world examples to a wider audience.\nClarify tooling differences: The growing variety of type checkers and tools is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, but can also reflect a lack of consensus/standardisation and can be confusing for users. There’s an opportunity to drive more consistency between tools or provide clearer guidance on their differences and best-fit use cases.\nTo learn more about Meta Open Source, visit our website, subscribe to our YouTube channel, or follow us on Facebook, Threads, X, Bluesky and LinkedIn.\nAcknowledgements\nThis survey ran from 29th Aug to 16th Sept 2025 and received 1,241 responses in total.\nThanks to everyone who participated!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Incident investigation can be a daunting task in today’s digital landscape, where large-scale systems comprise numerous interconnected components and dependencies\nDrP is a root cause analysis (RCA) platform, designed by Meta, to programmatically automate the investigation process, significantly reducing the mean time to resolve (MTTR) for incidents and alleviating on-call toil\nToday, DrP is used by over 300 teams at Meta, running 50,000 analyses daily, and has been effective in reducing MTTR by 20-80% \nBy understanding DrP and its capabilities, we can unlock new possibilities for efficient incident resolution and improved system reliability.\nWhat It Is\nDrP is an end-to-end platform that automates the investigation process for large-scale systems. It addresses the inefficiencies of manual investigations, which often rely on outdated playbooks and ad-hoc scripts. These traditional methods can lead to prolonged downtimes and increased on-call toil as engineers spend countless hours triaging and debugging incidents.\nDrP offers a comprehensive solution by providing an expressive and flexible SDK to author investigation playbooks, known as analyzers. These analyzers are executed by a scalable backend system, which integrates seamlessly with mainstream workflows such as alerts and incident management tools. Additionally, DrP includes a post-processing system to automate actions based on investigation results, such as mitigation steps.\n\nDrP’s key components include: \nExpressive SDK: The DrP SDK allows engineers to codify investigation workflows into analyzers. It provides a rich set of helper libraries and machine learning (ML) algorithms for data access and problem isolation analysis, such as anomaly detection, event isolation, time series correlation and dimension analysis.\nScalable backend: The backend system executes the analyzers, providing both multi-tenant and isolated execution environments. It ensures that analyzers can be run at scale, handling thousands of automated analyses per day.\nIntegration with workflows: DrP integrates with alerting and incident management tools, allowing for the auto-triggering of analyzers on incidents. This integration ensures that investigation results are immediately available to on-call engineers.\nPost-processing system: After an investigation, the post-processing system can take automated actions based on the analysis results. For example, it can create tasks or pull requests to mitigate issues identified during the investigation.\nHow It Works \nAuthoring Workflow\n\nThe process of creating automated playbooks, or analyzers, begins with the DrP SDK. Engineers enumerate the investigation steps, listing inputs and potential paths to isolate problem areas. The SDK provides APIs and libraries to codify these workflows, allowing engineers to capture all required input parameters and context in a type-safe manner.\nEnumerate investigation steps: Engineers start by listing the steps required to investigate an incident, including inputs and potential paths to isolate the problem.\nBootstrap code: The DrP SDK provides bootstrap code to create a template analyzer with pre-populated boilerplate code. Engineers extend this code to capture all necessary input parameters and context.\nData access and analysis: The SDK includes libraries for data access and analysis, such as dimension analysis and time series correlation. Engineers use these libraries to code the main investigation decision tree into the analyzer.\nAnalyzer chaining: For dependent service analysis, the SDK’s APIs allow for seamless chaining of analyzers, passing context and obtaining outputs.\nOutput and post-processing: The output method captures findings from the analysis, using special data structures for both text and machine-readable formats. Post-processing methods automate actions based on analyzer findings.\nOnce created, analyzers are tested and sent for code review. DrP offers automated backtesting integrated into code review tools, ensuring high-quality analyzers before deployment.\nConsumption Workflow\nIn production, analyzers integrate with tools like UI, CLI, alerts, and incident management systems. Analyzers can automatically trigger upon alert activation, providing immediate results to on-call engineers and improving response times. The DrP backend manages a queue for requests and a worker pool for secure execution, with results returning asynchronously.\nIntegration with alerts: DrP is integrated with alerting systems, allowing analyzers to trigger automatically when an alert is activated. This provides immediate analysis results to on-call engineers.\nExecution and monitoring: The backend system manages a queue for analyzer requests and a worker pool for execution. It monitors execution, ensuring that analyzers run securely and efficiently.\nPost-processing and insights: A separate post-processing system handles analysis results, annotating alerts with findings. The DrP Insights system periodically analyzes outputs to identify and rank top alert causes, aiding teams in prioritizing reliability improvements.\nWhy It Matters\nReducing MTTR\nDrP has demonstrated significant improvements in reducing MTTR across various teams and use cases. By automating manual investigations, DrP enables faster triage and mitigation of incidents, leading to quicker system recovery and improved availability.\nEfficiency: Automated investigations reduce the time engineers spend on manual triage, allowing them to focus on more complex tasks. This efficiency translates to faster incident resolution and reduced downtime.\nConsistency: By codifying investigation workflows into analyzers, DrP ensures consistent and repeatable investigations. This consistency reduces the likelihood of errors and improves the reliability of incident resolution.\nScalability: DrP can handle thousands of automated analyses per day, making it suitable for large-scale systems with complex dependencies. Its scalability ensures that it can support the needs of growing organizations.\nEnhancing On-Call Productivity\nThe automation provided by DrP reduces the on-call effort during investigations, saving engineering hours and reducing on-call fatigue. By automating repetitive and time-consuming steps, DrP allows engineers to focus on more complex tasks, improving overall productivity.\nScalability and Adoption\nDrP has been successfully deployed at scale at Meta, covering over 300 teams and 2000 analyzers, executing 50,000 automated analyses per day. Its integration into mainstream workflows, such as alerting systems, has facilitated widespread adoption and demonstrated its value in real-world scenarios.\nWidespread adoption: DrP has been adopted by hundreds of teams across various domains, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in addressing diverse investigation needs.\nProven impact: DrP has been in production for over five years, with proven results in reducing MTTR and improving on-call productivity. Its impact is evident in the positive feedback received from users and the significant improvements in incident resolution times.\nContinuous improvement: DrP is continuously evolving, with ongoing enhancements to its ML algorithms, SDK, backend system, and integrations. This commitment to continuous improvement ensures that DrP remains a cutting-edge solution for incident investigations, while its growing adoption across teams enables existing workflows and analyzers to be reused by others, compounding the shared knowledge base and making it increasingly valuable across the organization.\nWhat’s Next\nLooking ahead, DrP aims to evolve into an AI-native platform, playing a central role in advancing Meta’s broader AI4Ops vision, enabling more powerful and automated investigations. This transformation will enhance analysis by delivering more accurate and insightful results, while also simplifying the user experience through streamlined ML algorithms, SDKs, UI, and integrations facilitating effortless authoring and execution of analyzers.\nRead the Paper\nDrP: Meta’s Efficient Investigations Platform at Scale\nAcknowledgements\nWe wish to thank contributors to this effort across many teams throughout Meta\nTeam –  Eduardo Hernandez, Jimmy Wang, Akash Jothi, Kshitiz Bhattarai, Shreya Shah, Neeru Sharma, Alex He, Juan-Pablo E, Oswaldo R, Vamsi Kunchaparthi, Daniel An, Rakesh Vanga, Ankit Agarwal, Narayanan Sankaran, Vlad Tsvang, Khushbu Thakur, Srikanth Kamath, Chris Davis, Rohit JV, Ohad Yahalom, Bao Nguyen, Viraaj Navelkar, Arturo Lira, Nikolay Laptev, Sean Lee, Yulin Chen\nLeadership – Sanjay Sundarajan, John Ehrhardt, Ruben Badaro, Nitin Gupta, Victoria Dudin, Benjamin Renard, Gautam Shanbhag, Barak Yagour, Aparna Ramani\nThe post DrP: Meta’s Root Cause Analysis Platform at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is the second guest post in a two-part series from José Luis González. José Luis has a PhD in software development and is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer, who works with developers and engineering teams to deepen their Kotlin skills and apply the language effectively in real projects. At Hyperskill, he runs Kotlin instructor-led training for teams at Hyperskill that focus on advanced topics and practical problem-solving rather than theory.\nFirst post in the series: How Backend Development Teams Use Kotlin in 2025: Insights from a Certified Trainer\nI’d probably have to say swallowing CancellationException in general catch blocks (including runCatching). It looks harmless, but it disables cooperative cancellation, so timeouts, parent scopes, and lifecycles keep running “mysteriously.” In recent talks, linters, and guides, you still see this called out as a real-world production bug. Official docs stress that cancellation must propagate, detekt ships a rule warning if you don’t rethrow, and the coroutines library provides mechanisms that avoid catching CancellationException in generic catch-alls.\nUse the following pattern instead to always rethrow cancellations (or choose a helper that preserves them):\nsuspend fun <T> safeCall(block: suspend () -> T, fallback: () -> T): T = try {\n    block()\n} catch (e: CancellationException) {\n    throw e // never swallow cancellation\n}\n// catch other specific exceptions\n} catch (e: Exception) {\n    logger.error(\"call failed\", e)\n    fallback()\n}\nIf you like Result-style API, mirror the kotlinx approach as follows:\nsuspend inline fun <T> runSuspendCatching(block: () -> T): Result<T> =\n    try { Result.success(block()) }\n    catch (e: CancellationException) { throw e }\n    catch (e: Throwable) { Result.failure(e) }\nThis tiny rethrow keeps structured concurrency intact and matches the guidance you’ll hear in the latest coroutine discussions.\n2. If a team has only two hours to set up monitoring for their mobile Kotlin app, which specific dashboards should they prioritize?\nBegin with metrics that indicate whether users can successfully use the app. Crash-free users and ANR rate by version and device model tell you whether a release is safe to ship.\nFirebase Crashlytics handles this out of the box – just tag builds for quick filtering:\nFirebaseCrashlytics.getInstance().setCustomKeys {\n    key(\"version\", BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME)\n    key(\"commit\", BuildConfig.GIT_SHA)\n}\nAs for UI issues, use JankStats to log when and where frames drop, so you know which screens stutter:\nval jankStats = JankStats.create(window) { frame ->\n    if (frame.isJank) Log.d(\"Jank\",\n        \"Jank on ${currentScreen()} – ${(frame.frameDurationUiNanos / 1_000_000)}ms\")\n}\njankStats.isTrackingEnabled = true\nAnother main concern is performance, of course. With Sentry, you get end-to-end insights into what is actually slowing down your app: startup, navigation, network calls, etc. It correlates frontend and backend timing so you can spot bottlenecks and regressions fast.\nHere is a standard setup with tracing and profiling:\nSentryAndroid.init(this) { options ->\n    options.dsn = \"<dsn>\"\n    options.tracesSampleRate = 0.1\n    options.profilesSampleRate = 0.05\n    options.release = \"${BuildConfig.VERSION_NAME} (${BuildConfig.VERSION_CODE})\"\n    options.environment = BuildConfig.BUILD_TYPE\n}\nNow, let’s add some custom transactions for key flows:\nval tx = Sentry.startTransaction(\"screen:${currentScreen()}\", \"ui.load\")\nSentry.configureScope { it.setTransaction(tx) }\n\nval net = tx.startChild(\"http.client\", \"GET /api/items\")\ntry { /* network call */ } finally { net.finish() }\n\nval db = tx.startChild(\"db.query\", \"SELECT items\")\ntry { /* read */ } finally { db.finish() }\n\ntx.finish()\nAnd auto-tracing for network calls (OkHttp and Ktor):\nOkHttp:\nval client = OkHttpClient.Builder()\n    .addInterceptor(SentryOkHttpInterceptor())\n    .build()\nKtor:\nval client = HttpClient(CIO) {\n    install(Sentry) {\n        tracesSampleRate = 0.1\n        profilesSampleRate = 0.05\n    }\n}\nSentry Mobile Insights provides a prebuilt dashboard for this. It groups slow transactions and crash-free rate by release and device model, so you can see exactly where users struggle the most without the need for a custom setup.\nHere’s how a real trace looks in Sentry: You can see a cold start (app.start.cold), API calls, and rendering time, all visualized in one timeline, for a detailed breakdown of how much time the app spends on various tasks.\n\n\n\n\nCheck these dashboards in Sentry:\nPerformance / Transactions: p95 duration for app.start.cold, ui.load, and checkout.\nTraces / Slow spans to find lags in HTTP, database, or main-thread work.\nReleases / Crash-free and ANR: Correlate stability with performance.\nSentry (or Crashlytics) combined with JankStats will give you the full picture. Can users open the app, interact smoothly, and exit without crashes or leaks? Sentry covers both performance and crash tracking, so you can often use it alone, while Crashlytics remains a lightweight alternative many teams already have in place.\n3. When a mobile Kotlin application is running slowly in production, what are your top three profiling techniques, and what tools do you use for each?\nI wouldn’t say there’s anything groundbreaking here. I usually start with the same baseline we talked about earlier: Crashlytics, JankStats, and Sentry traces. They will provide a comprehensive overview of what’s going on. From there, my top three profiling techniques are pretty straightforward but extremely effective.\nHonestly, the standalone Android Studio profiler is still the most powerful and underrated tool out there. I spend most of my time in its CPU and memory profilers, checking which methods block the main thread or which allocations spike during transitions. I always check the Sample Call Stack view, as it’s the fastest way to see where time is actually spent per frame, instead of guessing from logs.\nIt sounds basic, but it often reveals that a single RecyclerView binding or JSON parser allocates thousands of tiny objects per frame.\nAlso, I would typically do network profiling. Using the Network Inspector or Sentry’s tracing, I check which requests block rendering or input. If scrolling freezes when images load, you can immediately tell whether it’s an uncompressed call or a missing cache layer without guessing. If you’ve already enabled Sentry Performance in the Monitoring section of the settings menu, it doubles as lightweight production profiling. You can literally see slow transactions by endpoint.\nFrame-time profiling is something that comes in handy as well. I like using JankStats or even adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo to see which screens consistently drop frames. Then I pair that with LeakCanary to catch activities or bitmaps that stay alive longer than they should. Together, that tells me exactly what’s slowing the UI down.\nIn short, you don’t really need fancy tools. CPU, memory, network, and frame-time profiling, all within Android Studio, cover about 90% of the real issues. These profiling tools help identify what’s making the app feel slow, so you can easily fix the underlying problems. \n4. When teams ask about Kotlin Multiplatform, what’s the smallest project they should start with to prove the concept?\nI usually remind teams that they’re probably using Kotlin Multiplatform already. Libraries like kotlinx.coroutines or kotlinx.serialization are basically multiplatform under the hood. You’re just using them from Android today, but they work the same on iOS, too.\nThe smallest realistic project to actually prove Kotlin Multiplatform in your environment is a shared data or utility layer – something both applications can call without touching the UI. A great first step is to share one simple function, like returning the current time or a version string:\n// commonMain\nexpect fun currentTime(): Long\n\n// androidMain / iosMain\nactual fun currentTime() = System.currentTimeMillis() // or NSDate().timeIntervalSince1970\nHere’s how to connect the Kotlin framework generated from the Kotlin Multiplatform project to your Xcode project:\nThe embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode task only registers if the binaries.framework configuration option is declared. In your Kotlin Multiplatform project, check the iOS target declaration in the build.gradle.kts file.\nkotlin {\n    ios() // or iosArm64(), iosX64(), iosSimulatorArm64()\n    binaries {\n        framework {\n            baseName = \"Shared\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nTo automatically build a shared module in Xcode, you need to add a script. In the Build Phases tab, add a run script with the following code:\ncd \"$SRCROOT/..\"\n./gradlew :shared:embedAndSignAppleFrameworkForXcode\n\n\n\n\nUsing the specified script, access the Gradle task to create and embed the library into the native iOS application.\nThen you should move the Run Script phase higher, placing it before the Compile Sources phase.\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the build on the iOS app side or iosApp configuration from the Kotlin Multiplatform project, the compiled xcode-frameworks will appear in the build folder of the shared module.\nThis will generate the framework at:\n\n\n\n\nThen import it into Swift:\nimport Shared\n\nlet t = currentTime() // works directly from the shared Kotlin code\nIf that builds and runs cleanly, you’ve already proven that Kotlin code can compile and interop on both sides. From there, you can expand to something slightly more useful. For example, a shared module that fetches and parses a list of items using Ktor and kotlinx.serialization.\nJosé Luis González\nJosé Luis González, PhD, is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer who teaches Kotlin and advanced techniques to development teams.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Qodana 2025.3 delivers important new capabilities that help teams standardize their development practices, improve compliance, make audits easier, and simplify large-scale code analysis. \nFrom introducing Global Project Configuration, a major step toward scalable, centralized policy management, to expanding license auditing for .NET and enhancing monorepository support for Java and Kotlin, Qodana 2025.3 makes it easier to maintain code quality and security across teams, languages, and repositories. Let’s take a closer look at what’s new.\nGlobal Project Configuration\nWe released support for Global Project Configuration, which brings Qodana users the ability to control all linter’s configurations in a single place for an entire organization or a team. You can also use it to enforce best practices, company-wide, without compromising  the needs of a specific project.  \nPreviously, adjusting or appending a rule (like permitting a new license or providing a specific pattern for hardcoded passwords) required manually updating profiles in all repositories. \nNow, with Global Project Configuration we’ve introduced a way to simultaneously apply specific configurations to the analyses for the projects you choose, and we’ve made applying these settings very easy.\nHow does it work?\nGlobal Project Configuration uses a dedicated repository where the organization can store all configurations needed for analysis. These configurations can be organized logically and can reference each other for reuse.\nFor instance, in the example below, the organization defined a “Base” profile that contains universal organization coding standards. After that “Team A” decided to enforce these standards using Lombok in their Java code, while other teams kept it optional. \nSo “Team A” created their own configuration by inheriting “Base” and assigned it to their projects. Meanwhile “Team B” decided that issues of their legacy project will not be handled, so they inherited “Base” and disabled all rules except security.\nQodana Global Project Configuration\n\n\n\nOnce a project is linked to a global configuration, Qodana automatically applies it on the next run. Configurations and the projects they are applied to can be easily viewed and managed through our UI. \nFor detailed instructions on setting up a repository, syncing it with Qodana Cloud, and linking projects, see Qodana Cloud → Settings → Global Configurations or view our documentation. \nLicense Audit for .NET\nThe license detection engine for NuGet packages has been improved in this release, and now supports packages which follow the Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specification. This means that Qodana will be able to detect licenses on a broader range of dependencies, and provide more accurate license auditing for .NET projects.\nQodana License Audit for .NET\n\n\n\nView License Audit Docs\nImproved monorepositories support for Java/Kotlin projects\nBy default, Qodana works with a project file defined at the root level of the repository. We’ve improved this behavior to support monorepositories consisting of loosely coupled projects not aggregated in a single project file.\nIf Qodana doesn’t detect a project file at root level it will recursively collect projects from subdirectories and import them for analysis.\nIt is possible to override automatic detection in qodana.yaml using the new rootJavaProjects property, which allows you to specify which projects should be included in the analysis. For example:\nrootJavaProjects:\n - \"./gradleProject\"\n - \"./mavenModule/pom.xml\"\nMonorepository Support\nWhat to do next\nThose are the key updates for this release. If you’re using the latest release tag, you don’t need to do anything to enjoy the benefits of our new Qodana 2025.3 release. \nOtherwise, please switch from 2025.2 to 2025.3 to update.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Kumar Harsh, draft.dev.\nDocker has changed the way we build and ship software. Instead of wrestling with “it works on my machine” issues, developers can now package applications and all their dependencies into a neat, portable container that runs anywhere. No wonder Docker has become the de facto standard for modern DevOps workflows.\nHowever, building and deploying containers at scale isn’t as simple as running docker build. You need a reliable CI/CD system that can consistently build, test, and push images to your registries while keeping the process fast, repeatable, and secure.\nIn this article, we’ll explore how to set up a complete Docker-based build and deployment pipeline with TeamCity’s first-class Docker support. You’ll see how features like built-in runners, native registry integration, and Kotlin DSL support make container pipelines smoother and more maintainable compared to the plugin-heavy, script-driven approach in Jenkins.\nBy the end, you’ll know exactly how to create and run a Docker pipeline in TeamCity, from building images to pushing them to your registry and even deploying them to staging.\nThe Docker pipeline setup experience in Jenkins vs. TeamCity\nIf you’ve ever tried to set up a Docker pipeline in Jenkins, you know the drill: Find and install the right plugins, configure them to match your environment, and then hold your breath hoping they don’t break when Jenkins upgrades. \nEven the official Docker plugin, while powerful, requires manual setup, custom scripting, and constant upkeep to stay compatible.\nFor many teams, this quickly turns into a maintenance burden, especially as pipelines grow more complex.\nTeamCity takes a very different approach. Docker support isn’t added on via third-party plugins; it’s baked into the product. Right out of the box, you get dedicated Docker build runners, registry integration, and full support for defining Docker steps in both the UI and the Kotlin DSL. That means no hunting down plugins, no brittle scripts, and far fewer surprises during upgrades.\nAnother difference lies in configuration. Jenkins pipelines often rely on long Groovy scripts or scattered YAML files, which can be challenging to maintain over time. TeamCity, on the other hand, offers a clean UI-driven configuration for quick setup, with the option to switch over to the Kotlin DSL for version-controlled, production-grade pipelines. This dual approach makes it easy to start simple and then scale your configuration as your projects demand.\nHow TeamCity handles Docker better\nHere’s what TeamCity’s native Docker support looks like in practice:\nDocker build runners: Instead of writing ad hoc scripts, you can add dedicated Docker build steps directly in your pipeline. Whether you’re building images, running containers, or cleaning up afterward, it’s all handled through first-class runners.\nBuilt-in registry support: Authenticating and pushing images to Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or a private registry is straightforward. TeamCity provides registry connections out of the box, so you don’t have to wire up custom credentials every time.\nKotlin DSL integration: If you prefer pipelines as code, you can declare Docker build and push steps in the Kotlin DSL with just a few lines. This makes it easy to track changes in version control and keep your pipelines reproducible.\nBundled Docker plugin: Perhaps the best part about all this is that there’s no separate plugin to install. The Docker integration is bundled with TeamCity, maintained alongside the product itself. That means fewer moving parts and no surprises during upgrades.\nCreating a Docker build and push pipeline in TeamCity\nLet’s now see TeamCity’s Docker support in action by setting up a simple build-and-push pipeline. The goal here is to take a standard Dockerfile, build an image from it, and push that image to a container registry like Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.\nStep 1: Set up your Dockerfile\nStart with a project that has a valid Dockerfile at its root. (You can use this one if you don’t have your own. Make sure to fork it to your GitHub account.)\nHere’s what the Dockerfile in this project looks like:\n# Use official Node.js LTS image\n\nFROM node:24-alpine\n\n# Set working directory\n\nWORKDIR /usr/src/app\n\n# Copy package files and install dependencies\n\nCOPY package*.json ./\n\nRUN npm install --production\n\n# Copy app source\n\nCOPY index.js ./\n\n# Expose the port the app runs on\n\nEXPOSE 3000\n\n# Start the app\n\nCMD [\"node\", \"index.js\"]\nIt’s a pretty barebones Dockerfile for setting up the environment for a Node.js app, copying source code files, and running the app.\nStep 2: Add a Docker build step\nIn TeamCity, set up a new project for your pipeline.\nNote: If you’re creating a new TeamCity project with a Dockerfile, TeamCity will most likely autodetect the right build steps for you to get started quickly. You can select the right steps for your workflow and click Use selected to set up the pipeline right away!\n\n\n\n\nTo learn how to add a Docker build step by yourself, read along.\nIn your TeamCity project, create a new build configuration if you don’t have one prepared already. In the build configuration settings page, go to Build Steps and add a new build step to build the Docker image.\nChoose Docker as the runner for the build step:\n\n\n\n\nOn the next page, you can configure what happens in this new build step. TeamCity’s Docker build runner makes this process straightforward. You don’t have to write ad hoc shell scripts for every operation – just pick the command you want (build, push, or other) and fill in the additional parameters as you need.\nFor example, in the build step, you need to configure the path to your Dockerfile, the platform your built images should target, and the name and tag for it. You can also supply additional arguments to add to the docker build command as follows, should you need to:\n\n\n\n\nThanks to TeamCity’s registry connections, you don’t need to embed credentials in scripts. TeamCity logs in before the build and automatically logs out afterward.\n💡 Pro tip: You can set environment variables in TeamCity (like commit SHA or build number) and use them in your image tags for traceability.\nHere’s the equivalent Kotlin DSL snippet:\nsteps {\n\n    dockerCommand {\n\n        name = \"Build\"\n\n        id = \"Build\"\n\n        commandType = build {\n\n            source = file {\n\n                path = \"Dockerfile\"\n\n            }\n\n            platform = DockerCommandStep.ImagePlatform.Linux\n\n            namesAndTags = \"krharsh17/hello-node:latest\"\n\n            commandArgs = \"--pull\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nStep 3: Add a Docker push step\nNext, add a Docker push build step. Select Docker once again as the build runner, and select push as the Docker command this time. Provide an image name and tag to use when pushing the image to your Docker registry:\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what the build step looks like as a Kotlin DSL snippet:\nsteps {\n    dockerCommand {\n        name = \"Push\"\n        id = \"Push\"\n        commandType = push {\n            namesAndTags = \"krharsh17/hello-node:latest\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nSave the build step.\nStep 4: Configure Docker registry connection\nAll that’s left now is to provide the TeamCity project with instructions on how to access your container registry account. You’ll need to do two things:\nCreate a new connection in your project.\nConfigure your build-and-push build configuration to use the Docker Registry Connections build feature to access the connection you just created.\n\n\n\n\nTo create the new connection, head over to Admin | Your Project | Connections | New Connection.\nChoose Docker Registry as the connection type, and provide your registry address and a username and password pair if needed:\n\n\n\n\nTest the connection and save it.\nTo use this connection through the Docker Registry Connections build feature, head over to your build configuration’s settings page and click the Build Features tab. Click the + Add Build Feature button here. In the dialog that opens, select Docker Registry Connections as the build feature to add.\nNext, you need to choose which connection to link here. Click on the + Add registry connection button, and select the new connection you just created:\n\n\n\n\nClick Save to add the feature.\nIf you prefer Kotlin DSL, here’s what the new build feature would look like:\nfeatures {\n    dockerRegistryConnections {\n        loginToRegistry = on {\n            dockerRegistryId = \"PROJECT_EXT_3\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nPROJECT_EXT_3 is the connection ID. You can get this value from the Connections page on your TeamCity project.\nStep 5: Testing the pipeline\nYou’re all set! It’s time to test the pipeline now.\nTry triggering a build. You should see a new image tag get pushed to your Docker registry as soon as the build completes:\n\n\n\n\nThis means that your Docker-native pipeline is ready.\nYou can also go further by adding steps to run containerized tests or deploy to a staging environment. For instance, spin up the freshly built container with docker run as part of your CI/CD workflow, then run integration tests against it.\nIntegrated security and caching features\nWhen building and pushing containers, you need to ensure functionality, security, and efficiency. TeamCity’s native Docker support includes features that help you protect sensitive data and speed up pipelines without extra work:\nSecure registry authentication: TeamCity’s Docker Registry Connections build feature automatically logs in to container registries (like Docker Hub or private registries) before each build and logs out afterward. You don’t need to embed credentials in scripts. TeamCity manages them securely for you.\nImage cleanup: When enabled, the Docker Registry Connections feature can automatically clean up pushed images after builds are cleaned up on the server. This keeps registry storage tidy and maintains good hygiene for build artifacts.\nLayer caching for speed: Rebuilding from scratch every time slows down development. With TeamCity’s Build Cache feature, key files and dependencies (like node_modules/ or .m2/) can be cached and reused across builds, significantly accelerating repeat runs.\nOptimized for iterative workflows: With secure, credential-managed builds and reusable cache artifacts, teams can iterate quickly on Docker pipelines. Small updates don’t mean starting over from scratch, and the process stays secure by default.\nConclusion\nIf you’ve ever grappled with Docker pipelines in Jenkins, you know how fragile things can feel: chasing down plugin updates, maintaining brittle scripts, and dealing with configs that never quite stay consistent. It works, but it often feels like you’re spending more time nursing your CI/CD than actually delivering software.\nTeamCity treats Docker as a first-class citizen. Native runners, registry integrations, caching, secrets management, and the Kotlin DSL replace Jenkins’s patchwork setup with a workflow you can actually rely on. Instead of simply trying to get builds to pass, you have a system you can trust to scale with you.\nIf you’re already running Docker pipelines in Jenkins, the migration path is straightforward and liberating. You’ll spend less time firefighting pipeline issues and more time shipping the features your users are waiting for.\nIf you’re ready to modernize your container pipelines, it’s worth seeing TeamCity in action. Head over to the TeamCity Docker documentation, or try TeamCity yourself and experience how first-class Docker support can simplify your CI/CD pipeline.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Since the 2025.3 release, we’ve published several rapid-response updates (2025.3.0.1–2025.3.0.4) for ReSharper and Rider to address the most urgent issues as quickly as possible. The 2025.3.1 update brings all of those fixes together and includes additional improvements that required more time to implement. \nFor Rider, it also delivers the data-sharing functionality we announced earlier this year, now refined based on the feedback we’ve received, along with Next Edit Suggestions – a significant step forward in how JetBrains AI supports your everyday coding by anticipating follow-up changes and keeping your code consistent as you work.\nLet’s take a look at these updates. \nRider 2025.3.1\nNext edit suggestions (NES) come to JetBrains Rider\nThe 2025.3.1 update to Rider introduces the long awaited new feature from JetBrains AI Assistant – next edit suggestions (NES). Next edit suggestions offer intelligent recommendations for edits across your entire file – not just the next line of code. \nNext edit suggestions work a lot like code completion – they appear as you type. But while completion focuses on your next token or line, NES reacts to the meaning of your edit, analyzing the change you just made and proposing follow-up updates elsewhere in your file. It also has more trigger points than completion, making it appear earlier and more frequently when it detects an opportunity to help.\nIn .NET projects, it might look like this: as you begin shaping a LINQ expression, NES picks up on the intent behind your edits and prepares related updates that may be needed in the rest of the method. It doesn’t replace code completion, but works alongside it, stepping in only when the changes you’ve made start to matter to the logic.\n\n\n\n\nYou will see NES suggestions highlighted in light purple. If they’re near your cursor, they appear instantly. If the suggestions touch other parts of the file, you’ll get a prompt to review and apply them.\nIn this example from an Unreal Engine gameplay code, as you start typing a new if condition inside TakeDamage(), NES immediately picks up on the intent behind the change, namely that you’re adding new death-related logic after the character’s health has been reduced. \n\n\n\n\nHow to enable the feature\nTo start using the feature, update JetBrains AI Assistant to the latest version and check the Enable next edit suggestions box in the settings (Settings | Tools | AI Assistant). You will also have the option to enable IDE-powered Code Insight actions.\n\n\n\n\nThe new feature is available as part of all AI Pro and AI Ultimate plans – with unlimited usage and zero impact on your cloud quota.\nWe’d love to hear what you think! You can share feedback directly inside the IDE – a prompt will appear after you begin using the feature. You’re also welcome to leave your thoughts in the comment section below this blog post.\nYou can find the documentation on this feature here.\nData sharing for better AI in JetBrains IDEs\nWith this update, we’re delivering the data-sharing functionality we previewed earlier. Our goal remains the same: to improve the quality and reliability of the AI features in our IDEs by learning from real-world usage, while ensuring that sharing data is always a choice and never a requirement.\nNothing changes unless you explicitly agree to participate. Organizations continue to control data-sharing at the admin level, and individual users can adjust their preferences at any time. For non-commercial users, detailed data sharing is enabled by default, but no information is collected until after you see the in-IDE notice and you may disable it immediately. All shared data is processed responsibly and protected under strict safeguards. \nYou can find the most detailed information on our data collection and usage here.\nNotable fixes\nNormal operation of the Suggested Plugins dialog has been restored. [IJPL-207992]\nMCP-related tool calls now return correct data for project dependencies, modules, and problems instead of empty or generic results. [RIDER-128984] \nThe Show in Find Results shortcut now works correctly when viewing implementing methods.  [RIDER-116221]\nRiderLink now compiles successfully with Unreal Engine 5.7 on Linux using v26 / clang-201.8.[RIDER-133226]\nFor the complete list of issues resolved, please see our issue tracker. \nDownload Rider 2025.3.1\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nReSharper 2025.3.1\nThese are the most notable fixes included in this update:\ndotTrace Viewer no longer fails to open snapshots [DTRC-31858]\nThe Submit Feedback dialog now shows all expected categories and options again, instead of limiting reports to performance issues only. [RSRP-502160]\nThe Code Cleanup window now renders correctly in Out-of-Process mode. [RSRP-502174]\nAI Assistant now stays activated after restarting Visual Studio. [RSRP-501759]\nIcons in the Options dialog now correctly follow the selected color scheme instead of appearing flat or uncolored. [RSRP-502170]\nResolved a TypeLoadException when running InspectCode with Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CodeStyle.Fixes 4.14.0, restoring full analyzer execution. [RSRP-502233]  \nFor the full list of resolved issues included in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.\nDownload ReSharper 2025.3.1\n                                                    \nResolved vulnerabilities\nA couple of security vulnerabilities –  [CVE-2025-64456] and [CVE-2025-64457] – have been resolved.\nThese vulnerabilities have been resolved in all Rider, ReSharper, and the .NET tools updates starting with 2024.3.9, including versions 2025.1.8, 2025.2.5, and the latest 2025.3.1.\nYou can download the latest builds from our website (Rider, ReSharper) or via the Toolbox App. You can also update Rider as a snap.\nThis is our last update of the year, and we want to close with a simple message: thank you. From the .NET team at JetBrains, we wish you a happy, warm, and safe holiday season. We’ll see you in the new year!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The next edit suggestions feature is now enabled in all JetBrains IDEs for JetBrains AI Pro, AI Ultimate, and AI Enterprise subscribers.\nYes, you read that right! JetBrains-native diff suggestions are available right in your editor. Global support for optimized latency. Out-of-the-box IDE actions for reliability. And the best part? It doesn’t consume your AI quota.\nWhat are next edit suggestions?\nLike the suggestions provided by AI code completion, next edit suggestions (NES) appear as you type. The difference is that NES can be proposed beyond the immediate vicinity of your caret, and they can modify existing code instead of exclusively adding new code. This feature is a natural extension of code completion, and together they comprise the in-flow Tab-Tab experience. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NES feature runs silently in the background, generating suggestions as you modify your code. It then gives you the option to review and decide whether to accept them in a small in-editor diff view (the NES UI). The feature adapts how it presents the suggestions, showing them to you in the least intrusive way to avoid interfering with your work. Large changes appear in a dedicated diff view, while smaller suggestions are shown in a larger popup.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, NES provide a smart code editing experience. Let’s agree to share responsibilities as follows: you can simply type and continue development as you used to, and we suggest small digestible diffs that help you do your job faster. Deal?\nWho can use NES? \nWith the latest AI Assistant update, next edit suggestions are enabled by default for all users with AI Pro, AI Ultimate, or AI Enterprise subscriptions. Unlike AI code completion, the next edit suggestions feature is currently unavailable for AI Free license holders. Stay tuned, though – we are actively working on bringing it to a wider audience!\nYou can always learn more about which AI features are available in different pricing tiers on our official page.\nHow do NES work?\nTrust us, there is a lot we could say about the internals, but we’ll try to keep things simple here.\nLong story short, next edit suggestions are where AI meets 🤝 the intelligence of JetBrains IDEs. Under the hood, the feature calls our cloud-based custom AI model and leverages deterministic IDE actions where possible. \nAI model\nCurrently, at their core, NES rely mostly on suggestions provided by a model fine-tuned specifically for this task. \nMuch like Mellum, the model is a small language model (SLM) that leverages cloud GPU infrastructure to provide the best possible latency all around the world. Unlike Mellum, however, the underlying model is bigger and leverages a different type of context: the history of your recent changes as opposed to the current file and RAG.\nBigger does not always mean slower! Our inference pipelines differ for code completion and next edit suggestions generation. NES employ several inference tricks that keep latency under 200 ms for the majority of requests, even at the busiest times of the day 💪. If you ever thought that completion in JetBrains IDEs was slow, it’s time to reconsider!\nIDE actions (code insights)\nDevelopers love our IDEs because of their reliability, and next edit suggestions put that aspect at your fingertips.\nAs part of their pipeline, when invoked, NES look for available code insights provided by the IDE and show them in the NES UI if they are appropriate. One of the easiest ways to see this interaction at work would be to look at a suggestion that renames an identifier in a file. The next edit suggestion will activate the IDE’s Rename refactoring, and usages will be conveniently updated. This even works with multi-file search!\n\n\n\n\nThe integration between next edit suggestions and IDE code insights is not yet fully complete. Because even frontier models struggle with out-of-distribution tools, or even just having a large number of tools in general, we are intentionally adding new IDE actions to NES slowly. We are prioritizing the ones that are useful the most often, as well as the ones the models can use most effectively. Let us know in the comments which IDE actions you would find useful in NES!\nSummary\nNext edit suggestions don’t replace the existing forms of code completion, but complement them, ensuring the best speed and relevance. Where code completion provides suggestions for new material, the next edit suggetions model works in the field of, well, edits. It is optimised to propose changes to existing code, but sometimes the best edit is simply to add something new. In those cases, the suggestions will look like completions because they are presented the same way – as inline gray text. \nThe simple scheme below explains which suggestion provider can be handled by which UI.\n\n\n\n\nSettings panel update\nIn addition to enabling this new feature, we are redesigning the settings for AI code completion and next edit suggestions. Shortly after the start of the new year, the settings for these features will be simplified. Instead of having to navigate multiple views, you will be able to view everything on a single screen, with all the most important options available.\nHere’s a sneak peek of the new design:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the settings for local completion, cloud-based completion, and next edit suggestions are all combined on a single page where you can decide what you want and what you don’t. \n\n\n\n\nAI code completion and NES cheat sheet\nDeciding which types of suggestions to enable may feel a bit overwhelming, so we’ve put together a short cheat sheet to help clarify which settings to enable in the new settings panel, depending on your preferred workflow.\nCase 1: You don’t want AI in your editor\nSimply turn off inline completion and next edit suggestions on this panel. We’ll make sure you don’t see any results of matrix multiplications.\nCase 2: You don’t want cloud-based suggestions\nJust turn on inline completion with local models. Those models are already bundled into your IDE and work without an internet connection. Good ol’ full line code completion will have your back.\nIf you want your own local solution, you can plug any open-source model into the IDE via LM Studio or Ollama. This option is available on the AI Assistant | Models settings page. Note that, currently, this option only works for code completion. We will closely monitor the level of quality that is possible with local inference for NES, with the aim of eventually including it as well.\nCase 3: You like completion but NES seem off\nIn this case, the best solution is to turn on inline completion with the Cloud and local models option and make sure that next edit suggestions are turned off. You will get the best from the Mellum model, and the IDE will automatically fall back to local models if your internet connection is unstable. \nCase 4: You like full-blown in-editor AI assistance\nTurn on both cloud models for inline completion and next edit suggestions to get code snippet suggestions as you modify your source code.\nWhat’s next for NES?\nHere is a quick look at some of the improvements we’re already working on:\nSmarter and more precise suggestions\nMore IDE actions for NES to use\nLonger tab sequences\nMany other developments are on our radar, and we’ll keep you updated as they come closer to fruition.\nThank-you note\nWhile you update your AI Assistant and GPUs go brrr, we would like to thank everyone who participated in the open Beta test for the next edit suggestions feature this fall.\nOver the last few months, the feature has been available to JetBrains AI subscribers who were willing to try it and share anonymous usage statistics. With your help, we were able to make sure the feature was ready and properly prepare the cloud infrastructure for a full-scale release. Thank you so much! ❤️\nTab–Tab,\nYour AI completion team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hi DataGrip and Database Tools community,\nShortly after the 2025.3 release, your feedback made it clear that the redesigned workflow for query files and query consoles introduced issues in several important scenarios, especially when working with global data sources.\nAfter reviewing the impact, we’ve decided that the best course of action is to revert this change in both DataGrip and the Database Tools plugin for JetBrains IDEs, rather than attempt incremental fixes while more users continue to update and encounter problems. \nThe rollback will be included in the upcoming 2025.3.1 release arriving later this week.\nThis affects only those who updated to 2025.3. If you haven’t updated yet, your workflow remains unchanged. If you have, we recommend updating to 2025.3.1 as soon as it becomes available to minimize the gap between the previous and restored behavior.\nWhat’s changing:\nQuery consoles return as the default workflow, working exactly as they did before 2025.3.\nQuery consoles saved before the migration will appear in the same locations as before.\nQuery files created during or after the migration will remain available. You can handle them in several ways:\n\nDelete query files you don’t need. In DataGrip, their default location is the /queries folder in the Files tool window. In other IDEs, their default location is the /.idea/queries mvb directory in the Project tool window.\nConvert query files you want to keep into query consoles. To do so, move them to the appropriate data source node under Scratches and Consoles | Database Consoles (in the Files tool window in DataGrip or in the Project tool window in other IDEs).\nKeep your query files for now. We plan to bring back an improved query file workflow early next year so it can work alongside query consoles in a more intuitive and flexible way.\nA note from the team\nWe apologize for the inconvenience and disruption caused by this change. We hold ourselves to a zero-regression standard, and this release did not meet it. That responsibility is on us, and our focus now is on minimizing the impact and restoring your workflow as quickly as possible. Your trust means a lot, and we’ll continue doing our best to earn it.\nAlthough we are reverting this change for now, our long-term goal remains unchanged: to improve this core workflow and make it more intuitive for both new and experienced users. We will move forward more carefully, and future updates will be more flexible and less disruptive, even if that requires more time and effort on our side.\nIf you have any comments or encounter any issues, please contact us through our issue tracker or support channels.\nBest regards,\nThe DataGrip team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Adopting Kotlin in a Java-centric company  is not about flipping a switch or rewriting everything “the right way”. It’s about people, timing, risk, and trust.\nOver the last four weeks, we’ve published a series of blog posts by Urs Peter, covering all of these aspects of migrating to Kotlin. In this post, we’ll tie the series together and give you one file you can hand to any engineer, tech lead, or manager to help them make the change.\nDownload the Kotlin Adoption Guide (PDF)\n                                                    \nUse this post as a map, and when you spot a topic that resonates, check out the PDF for detailed instructions, side‑by‑side code examples, and concrete migration patterns.\nThe journey in five parts\nKotlin adoption starts with a spark: one or two engineers who feel that Kotlin could make their code a bit clearer, safer, or easier to work with in the long run.\nThe guide walks you through a five-stage process to make this happen.\n Part 1: Getting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nWe’re starting small. And for good reason: You want to introduce Kotlin in a way that can’t possibly hurt production – by using your test suite.\nThis part shows you how to:\nWire Kotlin into an existing Java project.\nUse tools like Kotest and MockK.\nUse Kotlin’s null safety and collections in code you run every day.\nThe goal here is not to become an expert, but to answer a simple question: “Does working with this language feel better?”\nLearn More\n                                                    \nPart 2: Evaluating Kotlin in Real Projects \nOnce tests feel comfortable, you’ll inevitably start asking yourself, “Can we trust this in production?”\nPart 2 explores two paths:\nStarting a new service in Kotlin (often with Spring Boot).\nAdding Kotlin modules to an existing Java system.\nYou’ll see how to avoid the “Java in Kotlin syntax” trap, teaching you how to use extension functions instead of static helpers, nullable types instead of Optional, and data classes and immutability instead of boilerplate models and builders.\nLearn More\n                                                    \nPart 3: Growing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company \nPart 3 looks at the human side: how to get your colleagues on board with Kotlin by piquing their interest rather than pushing it on them.\nThis part will give you practical ways to:\nProvide small, focused examples of Java and Kotlin that respect people’s existing code.\nShare a starter repository with Kotlin, linting, tests, and CI already set up.\nHold short clinics, pairing sessions, and chats to give your colleagues a chance to ask you questions.\nBuild an in‑house Kotlin community that doesn’t depend on a single proponent.\nThe aim is simple: make it easy for others to say, “Let me try this on my next task.”\nLearn More\n                                                    \nPart 4: Helping Decision‑Makers Say Yes to Kotlin \nPersuading your tech-savvy employees is one thing – but what about your colleagues who ask, “How does Kotlin benefit us as a business?”\nPart 4 helps you explain the benefits of Kotlin in terms of business value:\nLess code to read and maintain.\nFewer defects thanks to null safety and safer defaults.\nNo re-writing required, as Kotlin has full Java interop and existing frameworks still work.\nDeveloper happiness and hiring – people want to work with thoughtful, cutting-edge tools.\nPredictable costs for training, gradual migration, and knowledge‑sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis part is written to help you have honest conversations with managers and architects who are accountable for risk, not just syntax.\nLearn More\n                                                    \nPart 5: Scaling Kotlin Adoption Across Your Organization\nOkay – let’s say you’ve managed to bring managers on board and teams are enjoying coding in Kotlin. Now to address the final question: “We have a lot of Java. How do we migrate without breaking things or burning people out?”\nPart 5 focuses on strategy at scale. It suggests:\nTreating systems differently based on lifecycle:\n\nLeave end‑of‑life apps as they are.\nDefault new builds to Kotlin.\nMigrate active systems step by step, not as big‑bang rewrites.\nUsing the right tools for the job:\n\nIDE conversion.\nNull‑safety annotations like JSpecify’s.\nAI‑assisted refactoring where tests are strong.\nRule‑based automation for large codebases.\nCapturing everything in a Kotlin “house playbook” so teams don’t have to re-learn it all from scratch.\nLearn More\n                                                    \nWho this guide is for\nThe guide is written for people who currently work in Java codebases and care about moving them forward responsibly:\nJava developers who want safer, more expressive tools without throwing away their experience.\nBackend and platform engineers running Spring Boot or similar stacks who need a clear, low‑risk path.\nTech leads and architects who are responsible for consistency across many services and teams.\nEngineering managers and decision‑makers who need a transparent view of costs, benefits, and risks.\nDownload the complete series as a PDF\nThe PDF version brings everything together:\nAll five parts of the journey.\nSide‑by‑side Java and Kotlin examples.\nMigration patterns, pitfalls to avoid, and success factors at scale.\nDownload the Kotlin Adoption Guide (PDF)\n                                                    \nTake a look and let us know what you think in the comments.

The 2025 JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey results show that it’s among the top languages developers plan to adopt next, with 10% of respondents saying they want to learn it. It’s no surprise then that this course, which is based on Luca Palmieri’s 100 Exercises to Learn Rust, was so popular this year. Each lesson begins with a failing test, and your task is to write the code that makes it pass. By the end, you’ll have completed 100 carefully selected challenges and gained confidence writing clean, idiomatic Rust in a real development environment.\n\n\n\n\n❤️ Introduction to JavaScript Programming\nBest for: beginners interested in web development.\nJavaScript isn’t just popular – it’s at the center of what most developers actually build. Three out of four developers work on websites or business software, where JavaScript is the industry standard. \nThis course is a perfect starting point for learning JavaScript from scratch. You’ll pick up all of the core concepts needed to understand how modern websites work and start writing interactive code inside a real IDE. By the end, you’ll have the foundation to move confidently into frontend or full-stack development.  If you want to keep going, our Full-Stack JavaScript course is the ideal next step.\nNew courses in 2025\nThis year, we focused on giving learners even more ways to explore programming. Alongside new IDE-based courses, we launched partnerships, expanded to new platforms, and introduced completely new skill paths. Here’s a look at what arrived in 2025 and what’s coming next.\n⭐ Skill Paths from JetBrains Academy and AWS\nIn October, we released our first joint Skill Paths with AWS – free to complete using the AWS Free Tier. These skill paths give you practical, real-world experience. You’ll write Python microservices, containerize them with Docker, deploy on AWS ECS or EC2, and even build and launch a full chat app using React and Flask.\nLearners have already earned more than 40 certificates co-branded by JetBrains Academy and AWS. Get yours by completing the course – a strong addition to your LinkedIn profile or portfolio.\n\n\n\n    \nEarly next year, we’ll also introduce new AI and LLM Skill Paths that dive into machine learning, reinforcement learning, and building applications with LLMs. You’ll learn how to train models with SageMaker, create Bedrock-powered assistants, and work with LangChain in real projects. At the end, you’ll have a working app or LLM endpoint, along with a verified certificate from JetBrains Academy and AWS. Save your spot on the waiting list!\n⭐ AI-Assisted Programming With JetBrains Academy and Nebius\nOver 65% of developers anticipate that AI proficiency will become a job requirement. AI tools are reshaping how we write and test code, but using them effectively isn’t always obvious. That’s why we teamed up with Nebius, an AI cloud platform, to create a new course series that helps developers move beyond the hype and learn how to work with AI in practical, meaningful ways. \nYou’ll write and debug Python code with AI support, use AI for QA and bug detection, automate routine steps with AI agents, explore common AI development tools, and build and test projects with Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, directly inside the IDE.\nIf you’re wondering whether learning to code still matters in an AI-driven world, we’ve covered this in our recent blog series, from why it’s still worth learning to code and exploring the psychology of beginner programmers to whether you should use AI at all.\n⭐ JetBrains Academy Courses on Coursera\nThis year, JetBrains Academy expanded to Coursera, bringing our IDE-based learning experience to one of the world’s largest education platforms. Two courses already support full IDE integration, so you can complete all coding tasks directly in PyCharm – Python from Scratch: Learn by Coding and AI-Assisted Programming. \nThis gives you a full IDE setup while you study – the same tools developers use, tightly connected to your Coursera coursework. In 2026, we’ll add even more JetBrains Academy courses to Coursera. Stay tuned for more!\n⭐ Java Foundations Professional Certificate\nJava may not be the newest language, but it remains one of the most in-demand.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI is more like a megaphone than a magic wand. It amplifies what is already there. Whatever habits you bring to your workflow, good or bad, AI will turn up the volume. \nEvery untested component, undocumented design, and ill-specified feature, to name a few, becomes louder when AI enters the mix.\nTeams with a clear intent about what they are building upfront, with the right best practices in place to preserve that intent, will find leverage with AI. But for those who rely on improvisation or unspoken rules, confusion multiplies. \nThe data tells the same story. A 2025 study by MIT and the U.S. Census Bureau found that firms with disciplined management practices mitigated short-term decline and boosted long-term returns when adopting AI.\nThis is how AI mirrors habits, not intentions, and reflects the culture that creates it.\nCulture in, culture out\nAI learns from what surrounds it. The more structure and clarity you give AI, the less noise you’ll get back. It’s not simply a garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO) problem. \nEven a well-written PRD can still lead to faulty code, which is why you need downstream safeguards like reliable unit tests to preserve the intent of the original input.\nThis helps explain why inaccuracy emerged as one of the top two risks for organizations in McKinsey’s 2025 global survey on the state of AI.\nThink of AI like an intern who learns by imitation and is guardrailed by good practices. When your codebase is well-patterned, commit messages are readable, and architectural intent is documented, AI can better navigate and contribute to your codebase intelligently. Without this structure, AI tools are left to guess intent and design, and are likely to leave a mess.\nDiscipline as leverage\nDiscipline is not optional in the age of AI. Setting and conforming to standards, and documenting decisions aren’t bureaucratic chores. They’re the signals AI uses to understand your world. They turn your practices into a map that both humans and machines can follow.\nIf your team already values practices like clean code, test-driven development (TDD), good documentation, and legible code reviews, AI will amplify these good habits by handling repetitive tasks following these good habits. \nThe aforementioned McKinsey study on the state of AI confirmed this: organizations with the highest returns from AI followed a range of best practices. However, without structure and processes, AI magnifies weakness, spreading it across every line of code.\nDiscipline doesn’t have to slow you down. There is a durable saying that can be applied here: go slow to go fast.\nSystems that scale\nAI extends your existing system. Continuous integration, automated checks, and code reviews create the safety nets that make scaling possible. When these systems are strong, AI integrates into them seamlessly. \nBut when those systems are missing, AI doesn’t fix the gap. It introduces errors faster than your feedback loops can correct them.\nLook at AI like a high-performance engine. It makes your car faster. But if you fail to tune your brakes and steering, you’ll just crash sooner. The 2025 State of AI Code Quality report by Qodo validates this, as teams using AI for code review saw quality improvements surge to 81%, compared to 55% for those without review.\nAI scales whatever exists. The question is whether what exists deserves scaling.\nDesign for delegation\nDelegating to AI without design is guesswork. You wouldn’t hand off a feature to a new developer without explaining its scope, dependencies, and success criteria. \nThe same logic applies to AI. When you define tasks precisely, AI amplifies precision. When you delegate vaguely, AI amplifies confusion.\nBreak tasks into clear, verifiable steps. Define what “good enough” looks like. Specify what the model should handle and where human judgment still matters. \nYour ability to define boundaries becomes the control knob for how AI reflects your team’s habits. The more intentional your delegation, the more reliable your automation.\nAs the technology evolves, those boundaries will shift. But clarity multiplies efficiency.\nWhat the mirror reveals\nAI is not a fixer of culture. It’s not a patch for weak processes or an escape hatch from discipline. It’s a mirror that reflects your practices in high definition. It will take whatever you already do and turn the volume up. \nIf your workflows are healthy, AI will reinforce that health. If your culture cuts corners, AI will cut them faster.\nThe promise of AI isn’t that it will make bad teams good. It’s that it will long-lever already good teams with good habits. Every improvement in your engineering culture makes your AI more effective. Every bad habit you ignore becomes louder.\nSo, before asking what AI can do for you, ask what your habits will cause it to spotlight next. AI doesn’t change who you are. It just amplifies what’s already there.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I struggled to get started. For ages, I kept putting off building this website, creating a new programming language for Visual Studio, and coming up with fresh color themes. Each project looked overwhelming, and I couldn’t find the time or motivation to jump in. It all just felt like too much at once.\nBut when a national holiday gave me a long weekend, I grabbed the chance to try out Copilot in Visual Studio and see how far I could get. To my surprise, I knocked out all three projects way faster and more easily than I expected. I’m sharing what I learned because I hope it inspires you to finally tackle those projects you’ve been putting off.\nIf you have some free time at the end of 2025, it might be the perfect opportunity to finally kickstart those ideas you’ve been meaning to work on.\nLet’s jump into how I kicked off the web development project.\nProject 1 – a static website\nA few years ago, I wrote a book called The Automated Home with little success. I wrote it mostly for myself and to help other smart home geeks come up with ideas and recipes for their own automations. A book isn’t a good format for that, so I’ve been wanting to turn it into a website for a long time.\nI exported the book from .docx to .txt so that I could feed it to Copilot in Visual Studio. Then I created an empty folder to hold the static website and opened it using File -> Open Folder.\nAnd then I went to the chat window and wrote a prompt to Copilot that went like this: “Turn this book into a website that should function like a book of recipes for home automation”.\nIt chewed on that for a while and a static website was slowly taking shape in front of my eyes. One file at a time added to Solution Explorer and opened in the editor.\nThe first result was pretty good. It had most of the content right, but the design, menu system, and content organization was suboptimal. My background as a web developer came in handy, because I knew what I wanted and how I wanted it. So, I started to be a lot more specific in my prompting and telling it how I wanted the CSS to look like etc.\nThe Home Automation Cookbook website\nThe AI was able to create this website in much less time than I would have been able to manually. Probably around 5x faster. I didn’t write much myself but would prompt the AI whenever I wanted a change. Only for small things would I do the coding manually.\nThe workflow was amazing, but it did involve quite a bit of waiting for Copilot to finish its tasks. That turned out great, because I was able to spend time with the family and make progress on the website at the same time.\nCheck it out at https://www.homeautomationcookbook.com\nProject 2 – a TOON language service\nI write Visual Studio extensions a lot, and this one has made it to the top of my to-do list. Mainly because of the challenge of creating a language parser and tokenizer that would work as a Visual Studio language service. TOON is a simple language, but even so, a language service requires some unique features I couldn’t find in any of the current TOON implementations in C#.\nThe TOON language inside Visual Studio\nTo provide syntax highlighting, syntax validation (squiggles), and other features, a language parser must be very fault tolerant. If you make a syntax error on line 10, you don’t want the rest of the file to lose syntax highlighting or be riddled with syntax violation errors. Most language parsers will simply throw an error if they see a syntax error and stop parsing completely.\nMy plan was to point the GitHub cloud agent to the TOON language specification and have it create the parser and based on that. I also wanted it to create unit tests based on the specification to validate the implementation was correct.\nI created a new .NET 10 Class Library project in Visual Studio 2026 and opened the Copilot chat window. The prompt I gave Copilot was something like “Based on the TOON specification (<url to spec>), create a parser and tokenizer that is suitable for use in a Visual Studio language service”.\nThe Copilot prompt for creating a TOON language parser showing the new Cloud Agent button\nOnce I clicked the Cloud Agent button to feed it my prompt, Visual Studio starts gathering the information it needs to come up with a plan. Once it does, it creates an issue on the GitHub repository with the information and then assigns GitHub’s cloud agent to the task.\nIn about 20 minutes, I received a pull request with the initial implementation by the cloud agent. It was a good first try, but more work was needed to make it work the way I wanted. I used a mix of both regular agent mode and the cloud agent to make further improvements.\nOver 600 tests created to validate the parser against the official TOON language specification\nI found that the cloud agent was most helpful when it came to isolated tasks. I could simply prompt it to begin the work in the background, while I did other work in Visual Studio. That way I had two workstreams going on in parallel and I could make headway fast.\nOnce complete, I asked the agent to make the class library into a NuGet package and set up automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions. I published the Toon Tokenizer package shortly thereafter and could now start working on the Visual Studio extension.\nThis is my wheelhouse. And once I created a new extension project, I could simply add the NuGet package and go to town. I did this part manually because I really enjoy extension development, so I wanted to do all the driving.\nThis was a super fun project, and I got to play around with the Profiler Agent to fine tune the parser performance. I also asked the agent to help find any security issues and mitigate them. It was able to find and fix some potential risks. Overall, a fantastic experience that turned out so much better than I could imagine. This was another 5-10x time saver thanks to Copilot.\nCheck out the Toon extension and parser repository.\nProject 3 – new color themes\nI’ve wanted to make some new color themes for Visual Studio for a long time. But it’s a type of extension I don’t have much experience with, so I wasn’t sure about how much effort would be required. Often, the unknown amount of time and effort is what makes me procrastinate on projects.\nTo kick this one off, I decided to use my old Blue Steel theme extension as the base. I wanted to create two solarized themes. The real challenge with this one was to map the color tokens with the right color codes. All I had was screenshots of the themes from the Solarized web page.\nIt looks like this:\nSolarized color theme from the official web page\nWith the screenshots, I asked Copilot to extract the color tokens for both the shell/environment and the code syntax colors and map them to the right color tokens in the VS XML theme file.\nThose XML files contain a bunch of categories with color tokens in each.\n<Category Name=\"Shell\" GUID=\"{73708ded-2d56-4aad-b8eb-73b20d3f4bff}\">\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"E56C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"CC6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillQuaternary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SurfaceBackgroundFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFFDF6E3\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"TextFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n</Category>\nCopilot did a fantastic job, but I had to play around with the colors a bit. There was still a bunch of manual finessing needed. But it gave me a jump start that saved me a lot of time.\nI ended up adding 6 new color themes to the Blue Steel extension.\nThe Solarized Dark color theme for Visual Studio 2026\nIf you’re interested in creating your own color theme(s) for Visual Studio, I suggest you clone the GitHub repo to get started. Make sure to change the GUID in both the .vstheme files and in the .vsixmanifest file to avoid conflicting with the original.\nIn conclusion\nIf Copilot hadn’t given me a running start, I probably wouldn’t have even started these projects. It would’ve been way more work. And honestly, it is not nearly as fun or satisfying. Seeing things come together quickly is super motivating and really helps keep you going until you finish.\nAgentic development was awesome for a lot of the work that went into these projects, but there were times I just wanted to do things the old-school way. Sometimes I just enjoy doing certain tasks myself, or it’s simply quicker to make some tweaks by hand.\nIn any event, these were fun to do. And I finally shipped what I’ve been wanting to do for so long.\nThe post How AI fixed my procrastination appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "It starts the way these things always start. \nA red build.\nA failing test.\nAnd that quiet, sinking feeling of “This worked yesterday.” \nMeet Sam. Sam’s not a junior, not a rockstar, just a solid developer who’s shipped enough code to know that bugs don’t care how confident you feel on Monday morning. \nThat test failure does not offer much help at all. There are no clear steps to reproduce the issue. The exception message seems familiar in a vague way. But it does not prove useful right then. Out of habit Sam hits F5. He notices something small yet pretty important about it. \nThe debugger launches faster than before. No long pause, no breaking his flow. Sam gets straight into debugging, and that small improvement already feels like a win. \nThe Exception Knows More Than It Used To \nThe app crashes. Sam opens the exception details. Normally, he’d read the error message, scroll through the stack trace, which shows the chain of function calls that led to the crash and start guessing what went wrong. \nThis time, things feel different. Exception Assistance ‘s Copilot analysis looked at the whole repository, not just the file in front of Sam. It checks past bugs, old pull requests, and even fixes from months ago. It notices a similar error that happened after a validation tweak, flags the code paths that might have been hit, and points to places where that odd value could have slipped in. \nIf Sam wants a different angle, he can pick any model in Copilot Chat to analyze the exception the way that fits the problem. And for trickier, nested, or chained errors, Copilot may decide it needs more context and offer to dig deeper.  Sam can continue with the deeper analysis to get a more context-driven, accurate understanding of what went wrong, without losing control of the investigation \nWhat used to take hours now feels like a conversation with a teammate who knows the history of your code and points you exactly where you need to look. \nWant to see this in action?\n\n\nInline Values: When If-Statements Stop Lying and Values Appear Where You Need Them \nSam steps through the code and lands on a conditional that should be true but is now showing false. \nNormally, you’d hover over every variable, checking them one by one but now? The result is right there. Inline in editor. The condition shows how it was evaluated.\nSam hovers and chooses Analyze with Copilot. Instead of just seeing “false,” Copilot breaks the condition apart sub-expression by sub expression showing exactly which part failed and how it affected the outcome. No stepping. No breakpoint. Just reasoning where the decision happened.  \nAs Sam moves on, he notices something else that clicks: \nMethod parameters? Inline. \nLoop variables? Inline. \nReturn values? Inline, where they’re used, not buried inside a function call.\nOne way keeps returning a value that feels wrong. Sam doesn’t step into it. Doesn’t add watches. He just hovers, asks Copilot to analyze the value, and instantly sees an explanation grounded in runtime behavior and the surrounding code. \nIt doesn’t replace DataTips or visualizers; they’re still there when Sam needs to dig deeper. But most of the time, the answer he’s looking for is already right in front of him. \nWant to see this in action?\n\nWhen a Test Fails, and You Don’t Debug Alone \nLater that day, another test failed. Different feature. Same frustration. Sam right-clicks the test and selects Debug with Copilot. \nThe Debugger Agent takes over. It looks at the test, its code, and recent changes. Then it makes a guess, applies a fix, runs the test, adjusts, and tries again. Sam watches. Not hands-off, but without the usual busy work. When it’s done, there’s a clear summary of what has changed and why. Sam reviews it, nods, and commits. \nThis isn’t giving up control.\nIt’s cutting out the repetitive stuff so Sam can focus on the important decisions. \nWant to see this in action?\n\nThe Calm at the End of Debugging \nBy the end of the day, Sam notices something important. \nThe bugs weren’t easy.\nThe code wasn’t simple.\nBut understand them? That came faster. \nVisual Studio 2026 doesn’t make debugging magic. It makes it feel like a conversation between Sam, his code, his history, and tools that get the context. By the end of the day, Sam closes the debugger feeling focused, not worn down.  \nThese improvements in Visual Studio 2026 are the first steps toward a smoother, calmer, more intuitive debugging experience, less time guessing, and more time understanding.  There’s a lot more coming, and your feedback is crucial. Tell us what works, what doesn’t, and where debugging still trips you up. \nHappy Debugging.  \nThe post Debugging, but Without the Drama (A Visual Studio 2026 Story) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'비 오는 밤 성수동 카페', '새벽 3시 집중력을 높이는 로파이'처럼 구체적인 상황과 감성을 담은 컨셉을 잡아야 하는데, 여기서부터 많은 분들이 막막함을 느꼈을 거예요. 게다가 저작권 걱정 없이 좋은 음원을 확보하는 건 또 다른 큰 산이었습니다. 유튜브 오디오 보관함이나 NCS 같은 무료 음원도 있지만, 너무 많은 사람들이 사용해서 차별화가 어렵다는 단점이 있었죠.\n  AI 음원의 등장: 요즘은 수노(Suno AI)나 유디오(Udio) 같은 AI로 직접 음원을 만드는 추세예요. 하지만 이것도 처음에는 '프롬프트'를 어떻게 작성해야 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있을지 정말 어렵게 느껴질 수 있습니다.\n2. 시각 자료 제작의 복잡성\n음악만 계속 틀어놓으면 시청자들이 금세 지루함을 느낄 수 있죠. 그래서 배경 영상이나 이미지가 필수인데, 미드저니(Midjourney)나 캔바(Canva) 같은 도구를 배우는 것도 일이었어요. 거기서 끝이 아니죠! 정적인 이미지에 오디오 스펙트럼 같은 움직임을 더해서 시청자의 시선을 사로잡아야 했습니다. 그런데 이런 효과를 넣으려면 프리미어 프로나 캡컷(CapCut) 같은 전문 영상 편집 프로그램을 배워야 하니, 이 단계에서 좌절하는 분들이 많았을 겁니다.\n3. 긴 영상 편집과 렌더링의 고통\n배경 영상 위에 음원을 배치하고, 화면 하단에 곡 제목을 표시하고, 여러 영상 효과를 반영하는 것 자체가 어려운 작업입니다. 특히 플레이리스트 영상처럼 1시간 이상의 긴 영상을 원활하게 편집하고 렌더링하려면 앞서 언급한 전문 영상 편집 프로그램은 거의 필수적이죠. 배우는 것도 어렵지만, 저사양 컴퓨터로는 렌더링에만 반나절이 걸리는 경우도 허다해서 '대체 언제 다 만들지?' 하는 생각이 절로 들었습니다.\n\n\n4. 시간 소모와 초기 노출의 한계\n이 모든 과정을 숙련자가 해도 영상 하나 만드는 데 최소 3시간에서 5시간은 족히 걸렸습니다. 기획/선곡 1~2시간, 시각 자료 제작 30분~1시간, 편집/렌더링 1~2시간, 유튜브 업로드/SEO 30분… 매일 이렇게 작업하려면 정말 힘들었겠죠? 게다가 이미 로파이걸 같은 거대 채널들이 시장을 장악하고 있어서 신규 채널이 알고리즘의 선택을 받기까지는 최소 3~6개월 이상의 꾸준한 노력이 필요했습니다. 매번 새로운 무드를 찾아내고 수십 곡의 리스트를 짜는 작업은 창의적인 에너지를 엄청나게 소모하며 소재 고갈에 빠지기 쉬웠고요.\n하지만 오늘 제가 소개해드릴 방법은 이 모든 과정을 획기적으로 단축시켜줍니다. 특히 AI 도구를 활용하면 저작권 문제에서 훨씬 자유롭고, 제작 시간도 놀랍도록 줄일 수 있으니, 정말 솔깃하지 않나요? 이제 본격적으로 강력한 두 가지 앱을 소개해드릴게요!\n  AI 플레이리스트 제작, 시작 전 준비물!\n자, 그럼 이 놀라운 AI 도구들을 사용하기 전에 몇 가지 준비할 것이 있습니다. 생각보다 간단하니 걱정 마세요!\n구글 아이디 및 API 발급: 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 제미나이를 기반으로 작동하는 'AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터'를 사용하려면 구글 AI 스튜디오 사용을 위한 구글 아이디와 API 발급이 필요해요. API 발급 방법은 제가 다른 영상에서 상세히 다뤘으니, 본문이나 댓글에 있는 링크를 참고하셔서 먼저 발급받아주세요.\nSuno AI 가입: 음악 생성을 위해 suno.com에 접속하셔서 간단하게 가입해주셔야 합니다.\n⚠️ 중요! Suno AI 유료 플랜: Suno AI에서 생성한 음원을 유튜브 수익 창출이나 음원 발매 등 상업적으로 활용하려면 반드시 유료 플랜에 가입해야 합니다. 이 점 꼭 기억해 주세요!\n이 두 가지 준비물이 갖춰졌다면, 이제 본격적으로 AI와 함께 플레이리스트 채널을 만드는 여정을 시작해볼까요?\n  AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터: 기획부터 썸네일까지 원스톱!\n이 앱은 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 제미나이를 기반으로 작동하는데요. 단순히 아이디어만 툭 던져주는 수준이 아닙니다. 실제 음악 생성에 필요한 전문적인 프롬프트부터 채널 운영에 필수적인 모든 요소를 그야말로 원스톱으로 제공해줘요. 제가 직접 써보니, 정말이지 '이게 되네?' 싶을 정도로 놀라웠습니다.\n\n\n✨ AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터의 핵심 기능 4가지\n클릭을 부르는 감성적인 제목 생성: '재즈 음악'처럼 평범한 제목이 아닌, 이모지와 감성적인 문구, 그리고 검색 키워드까지 고려한 매력적인 제목을 뽑아줍니다. 예를 들어, ' ️ 비 오는 밤, 따뜻한 커피와 함께 듣는 감성 재즈'처럼요.\nSuno 5.0에 최적화된 프롬프트 생성: 단순히 '재즈 만들어줘'가 아닙니다. 악기 구성, 공간감, 연주 스타일까지 아주 디테일하게 작성된 전문적인 프롬프트를 생성해줘요. 여러분은 그저 복사해서 Suno AI에 붙여넣기만 하면 끝입니다!\n맞춤형 가사 생성: 인트로, 벌스, 코러스 같은 곡 구조를 설정해서 가사를 뽑을 수 있고요. 가사가 없는 연주곡 모드도 지원하니, 다양한 컨셉을 시도해볼 수 있습니다.\n가장 중요한, 고퀄리티 썸네일 자동 생성: 배경에 'PLAYLIST'라는 문구가 자연스럽게 들어간 고퀄리티 이미지를 생성하고, 그 위에 원하는 감성 폰트로 제목까지 합성해줍니다. 포토샵 같은 전문 프로그램은 전혀 필요 없어요. 정말 정말 편리하죠!\n ️ AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터 사용법 (단계별 가이드)\n사용 편의성을 위해 화면을 양쪽으로 나누어 'AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터'와 'Suno AI'를 함께 실행하는 것을 추천해요. 그러면 작업 효율이 훨씬 높아집니다.\n장르 선택: 앱 첫 화면에서 플레이리스트 채널에서 가장 인기 있는 장르를 선택합니다. 만약 원하는 장르가 없다면 직접 입력할 수도 있어요. (예시: 로파이(Lo-Fi) 장르 선택)\n제목 선택: 선택한 장르에 적합한 제목 리스트가 생성되면, 그중 마음에 드는 감성적인 제목을 고릅니다. (예시: '비오는 날 창밖 보며 멍 때리기 좋은 감성' 선택)\n프롬프트 및 가사 설정: 화면이 바뀌면 왼쪽에 Suno AI용 프롬프트가 나타나요. 오른쪽에서는 생성할 가사의 언어와 곡 수를 선택하고, 곡의 구성을 설정합니다. 앱이 사용자가 선택한 내용에 적합한 곡 구성을 미리 추천해 주니 정말 편리하죠. 그 다음 가사에 적용할 비유와 은유의 정도를 선택하고, 인트로/아웃트로에도 가사를 포함할지 결정한 후 가사를 생성합니다. 연주곡을 원한다면 '가사 없음'을 선택하면 됩니다.\nSEO 정보 생성 및 저장: 빠른 유튜브 SEO 작업을 위해 영상 제목, 설명, 해시태그, 키워드를 생성하는 기능이 있어요. 이걸 메모장에 미리 복사해두면 나중에 정말 유용하게 쓸 수 있습니다.\nSuno AI로 음악 생성: AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터에서 생성된 Suno AI용 프롬프트를 복사하여 Suno AI의 스타일 칸에 붙여넣습니다. 가사가 생성되면 제목과 가사를 각각 복사한 후 Suno AI에 붙여넣기 하고 'Create' 버튼을 클릭하여 곡을 생성합니다.\n썸네일 생성 및 다운로드: 곡이 생성되는 동안 유튜브 썸네일 탭으로 이동하여 스타일과 폰트를 선택한 후 '생성' 버튼을 클릭합니다. 플레이리스트 제목이 멋지게 적용된 썸네일이 생성되는데, 수정사항이 있다면 입력하여 이미지의 일관성을 유지한 채 원하는 내용만 수정할 수 있습니다. 마음에 드는 썸네일은 바로 다운로드하세요!\n곡 다운로드: Suno AI에서 생성된 로파이 음악을 들어보고, 만족스럽다면 가사만큼 같은 작업을 반복하여 곡을 생성한 후 모두 다운로드합니다.\n  스펙트럼 스튜디오: 영상 편집 없이 전문가급 영상 만들기!\n이제 Suno AI로 만든 음악 파일을 가지고 '스펙트럼 스튜디오'를 활용해 실제 플레이리스트 영상을 만들어 볼 차례입니다. 이 도구는 정말이지 혁신적이라고 생각해요. 복잡한 영상 편집 프로그램 없이도 브라우저에서 바로 유튜브 플레이리스트 영상을 만들 수 있는 웹 기반 도구거든요!\n\n\n\n프리미어 프로나 파이널컷 같은 전문 편집 프로그램을 따로 배우지 않아도 되고, 프로그램을 설치할 필요도 없이 인터넷 브라우저만 있으면 어디서든 사용할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적입니다. 게다가, 앞서 소개한 AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터와 달리 AI 기능을 사용하지 않기 때문에 API 발급도 필요 없고, 가입만 하면 바로 사용할 수 있어요. 접근성이 정말 좋죠?\n  스펙트럼 스튜디오의 독보적인 강점 5가지\n환상적인 오디오 스펙트럼 기능: 음악에 반응해서 실시간으로 움직이는 시각화 효과를 만들어줍니다. 막대형, 원형, 파형 등 다양한 스타일을 선택할 수 있고, 색상부터 반응 민감도까지 세밀하게 조정해서 나만의 감성을 표현할 수 있어요.\n로고 배경 자동 제거: 포토샵 없이도 클릭 한 번으로 로고 배경을 깔끔하게 제거하여 영상에 자연스럽게 합성할 수 있습니다. 채널의 브랜딩을 강화하는 데 아주 유용하죠.\n감성적인 특수 효과와 필터: 물방울, 반짝이는 입자, 빈티지 필터 등을 추가하여 영상을 훨씬 풍성하고 감성적으로 만들 수 있습니다. 시청자들의 눈을 즐겁게 해줄 거예요.\n타임라인 자동 복사 기능: 버튼 한 번으로 유튜브 설명란에 들어갈 곡 제목과 시간 정보가 자동으로 복사됩니다. 일일이 시간을 적을 필요가 없으니 정말이지 시간을 엄청나게 아낄 수 있습니다!\n빠르고 안전한 로컬 렌더링 방식: 여러분의 파일을 서버로 보내지 않고 PC에서 바로 처리하기 때문에 개인정보 유출 걱정이 없고, 렌더링 속도도 빠르며 안전합니다.\n이 모든 강점 덕분에 2시간짜리 플레이리스트 영상을 편집부터 렌더링 완료까지 40분에서 50분이면 충분하다고 합니다. 기존 방식으로는 몇 시간씩 걸리던 작업을 1시간 안에 끝낼 수 있다니, 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n⚙️ 스펙트럼 스튜디오 사용법 (단계별 가이드)\n음악 파일 업로드: Suno AI에서 작업한 음악 파일을 스펙트럼 스튜디오에 업로드합니다. 업로드한 파일의 재생 순서도 변경할 수 있으니 참고하세요.\n타임라인 복사: 상단에 있는 타임라인 복사 버튼을 클릭하면, 해당 곡으로 바로 이동할 수 있는 타임라인이 자동으로 생성됩니다. 이것도 메모장에 복사해 두면 유튜브 업로드 시 매우 유용해요.\n이미지 및 로고 등록: 앞서 AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터에서 만들어둔 썸네일 이미지를 등록합니다. 채널 로고가 있다면 함께 업로드할 수 있어요.\n재생 설정: 전체 음악을 몇 번 반복할지 재생 횟수를 선택하고 오디오 품질도 선택한 후 편집 스튜디오로 넘어갑니다.\n편집 스튜디오 설정:\n\n오디오 스펙트럼: 왼쪽에서 막대형, 미니막대형, 원형, 파형 등 다양한 스타일을 선택하고, 오른쪽 아래에서 스펙트럼의 위치, 크기, 스타일 등 세부 속성을 변경합니다.\n로고 조정: 오른쪽 위에서 업로드한 로고 이미지의 크기와 위치를 조절하고, 배경 제거 기능을 활용하여 깔끔하게 적용할 수 있습니다.\n배경 효과: 왼쪽 아래에서는 배경 이미지에 다양한 필터와 비네팅 효과를 줄 수 있습니다.\n특수 효과: 바로 아래에는 배경 이미지 위에 움직이는 물방울과 반짝임 특수효과를 적용하고, 이 효과들의 속성을 제어하는 특별한 기능이 있습니다.\n비디오 내보내기: 모든 설정이 완료되면 우측 상단의 '비디오 내보내기'를 클릭하고, 다음 화면에서 'MP4 렌더링 시작'을 클릭합니다. 저장할 파일명 설정 후 바로 렌더링이 시작되며, 짧은 시간 안에 고품질 영상이 완성됩니다.\n✅ 완성된 플레이리스트 영상, 유튜브에 업로드하기!\n이제 대망의 마지막 단계입니다!

Notepad++, Winamp, Paint.NET, foobar2000, Everything Search 같은 이름들을 들어보시면 아마 고개를 끄덕이실 거예요. 용량도 몇 MB에 불과한데, 실행은 눈 깜짝할 사이에 되고, RAM도 거의 사용하지 않았죠. 솔직히 저도 가끔 이런 앱들을 쓰면서 '아, 옛날 앱이 짱이지!' 하고 감탄할 때가 많아요. 구형 컴퓨터에서도 전혀 버벅거림 없이 잘 돌아가는 걸 보면, 정말이지 최적화의 극치를 보여줬다고 생각합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #0f4c81; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>네이티브 앱이란?</b> 운영체제 고유의 프레임워크를 사용하여 개발되어, OS의 기능과 자원을 가장 효율적으로 활용하는 애플리케이션을 의미합니다. 마치 그 운영체제만을 위해 태어난 것처럼, OS와 완벽하게 조화를 이루는 것이 특징이죠.</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  웹 기술 만능주의, 개발자들의 선택 'Electron'</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그런데 어느 순간부터 '네이티브 앱'이라는 단어는 점점 희미해지기 시작했습니다. 그 자리를 채운 것은 다름 아닌 웹 기술을 기반으로 한 앱들이었죠. 특히 Electron이나 PWA(Progressive Web Apps) 같은 기술들이 대세로 떠오르면서, 개발자들은 윈도우, macOS, 리눅스 등 각기 다른 운영체제별로 앱을 따로 만들 필요가 없어졌습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이게 왜 그렇게 매력적이었냐면, 한 번 HTML, CSS, JavaScript로 웹 앱을 만들면 Electron이 이 웹 앱을 마치 데스크톱 애플리케이션처럼 실행시켜 주기 때문이에요. Electron은 Chromium 브라우저 엔진과 Node.js 런타임을 통째로 앱에 포함시키는 방식인데, 덕분에 개발자들은 하나의 코드베이스만 관리하면 됩니다. 개발팀에 웹 개발자만 있어도 모든 플랫폼용 앱을 만들 수 있게 된 거죠. 반복 작업도 줄어들고, UI 변경도 훨씬 쉽습니다. 기존에 수많은 웹 라이브러리가 있다는 것도 엄청난 장점이고요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 장점들 덕분에 Slack, Discord, Figma의 데스크톱 클라이언트, Obsidian, Notion, 그리고 최근의 WhatsApp까지, 수많은 유명 앱들이 Electron이나 유사한 웹 기술을 택했습니다. 개발자 입장에서는 더할 나위 없이 편리한 선택지였던 거죠. 제 생각엔 이 흐름을 거스를 수 없었을 것 같아요. 그런데 말입니다, 개발자의 이런 편리함이 과연 사용자에게도 좋은 방향이었을까요?</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FxzLDp%2FdJMcahQvCSH%2F91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"개발자의 효율적인 웹 기술 사용과 그로 인해 고통받는 사용자의 모습을 대비하여 보여주는 이미지.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  사용자가 지불하는 '성능 세금': 앱이 무거워지는 이유</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">아쉽게도, 개발자 편의성의 대가는 고스란히 사용자에게 '성능 세금'으로 부과되었습니다. Electron 앱은 기본적으로 자기만의 브라우저를 통째로 품고 있습니다. 여러 Electron 앱을 동시에 실행하면, 마치 여러 개의 크롬 브라우저를 띄워 놓은 것처럼 수많은 Chromium 인스턴스가 여러분의 PC 메모리를 점령하게 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 한두 개만 켜도 RAM 사용량이 확 오르더라고요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">고성능 PC를 사용한다면 체감하기 어려울 수도 있지만, 보급형 노트북이나 오래된 컴퓨터에서는 그야말로 끔찍한 성능 저하를 경험하게 됩니다. 앱 실행 속도는 현저히 느려지고, UI 요소들이 네이티브 앱처럼 부드럽게 작동하지 않거나 시스템 테마와 동떨어지는 경우도 흔합니다. 키보드 단축키도 제멋대로인 경우가 있고요. 게다가 이렇게 여러 브라우저가 메모리에 상주하고 있으면 노트북 배터리 수명에도 치명적일 수밖에 없습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">물론 모든 Electron 앱이 나쁘다는 건 아닙니다. 대표적인 예시가 바로 Visual Studio Code(VS Code)죠. VS Code는 Electron 기반임에도 불구하고 뛰어난 성능과 놀라운 최적화를 보여주는, 최고의 코드 편집기 중 하나입니다. 이 사례를 보면 Electron 자체가 문제가 아니라, 개발 과정에서 <b>최적화에 대한 '관심'과 '노력'이 줄어들기 쉬운 환경이 조성되었다</b>는 점이 더 큰 문제라고 생각해요. 편리함 뒤에 숨겨진 책임감의 부재랄까요?</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">⚠️ <b>주의!</b> 저사양 PC나 오래된 노트북 사용자라면 웹 기반 앱의 성능 저하를 더욱 크게 체감할 수 있습니다. 수많은 백그라운드 프로세스가 시스템 리소스를 잠식하고, 이는 느려진 반응 속도와 급격한 배터리 소모로 이어질 수 있어요.</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  마이크로소프트도 이 변화를 부추기고 있나?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 흐름에 마이크로소프트 역시 크게 제동을 걸지 않았다는 점도 주목할 만합니다. 아니, 어쩌면 마이크로소프트 자체가 이러한 변화를 은연중에 부추기고 있는지도 모릅니다. Edge 브라우저의 엔진을 앱에 내장할 수 있는 WebView2 같은 기술을 제공하고 있고, 마이크로소프트 스토어에는 이미 웹 기반 Electron 앱들이 차고 넘치죠. 심지어 마이크로소프트의 자체 제품인 Teams나 Office의 일부 요소들도 웹 기술에 크게 의존하고 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">엎친 데 덮친 격으로, 전통적인 윈도우 UI 프레임워크들은 시간이 갈수록 파편화되고 혼란스러워지고 있습니다. Win32, WPF, UWP, WinUI 3, 그리고 MAUI까지, 끊임없이 새로운 프레임워크가 등장하고 바뀌면서 소규모 개발자들이나 인디 개발자들이 윈도우 전용 코드베이스를 유지하는 것이 거의 불가능에 가까워졌어요. '내가 이미 React를 아는데, 굳이 XAML과 씨름할 필요가 있을까?' 하고 생각하는 게 어쩌면 당연한 일입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 스토어에서 Electron 앱도 잘 받아주는데, 굳이 고생해서 네이티브 도구를 만들 이유가 없어지는 거죠. 과거 네이티브 윈도우 앱들은 셸 확장, 전역 단축키, 파일 연결, 드래그 앤 드롭, 알림 시스템, 심지어 작업 표시줄 통합 같은 시스템 기능들과 정말 유기적으로 연결되어 있었습니다. 이런 섬세한 통합성은 점점 더 획일화되는 웹 UI에서는 재현하기 어렵습니다. 잘 만들어진 네이티브 앱과 웹 기반 앱을 비교해 보면, 특히 저사양 하드웨어에서는 성능 차이가 극명하게 드러나는 걸 알 수 있어요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Yb7Lh/dJMcah32BUP/ufjHQcjmWYgcEKVsbzyIGk/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Yb7Lh/dJMcah32BUP/ufjHQcjmWYgcEKVsbzyIGk/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/Yb7Lh/dJMcah32BUP/ufjHQcjmWYgcEKVsbzyIGk/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FYb7Lh%2FdJMcah32BUP%2FufjHQcjmWYgcEKVsbzyIGk%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"복잡하게 얽힌 윈도우 UI 프레임워크와 단순하고 깔끔한 웹 개발 스택을 대조하여 보여주는 시각적 은유.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  그럼에도 불구하고, '진정한' 네이티브 앱은 살아있다!</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그럼에도 불구하고, 다행히도 여전히 훌륭한 네이티브 윈도우 앱들이 꾸준히 개발되고 유지되고 있습니다.

Notepad++, Winamp, Paint.NET, foobar2000, Everything Search 같은 이름들을 들어보시면 아마 고개를 끄덕이실 거예요. 용량도 몇 MB에 불과한데, 실행은 눈 깜짝할 사이에 되고, RAM도 거의 사용하지 않았죠. 솔직히 저도 가끔 이런 앱들을 쓰면서 '아, 옛날 앱이 짱이지!' 하고 감탄할 때가 많아요. 구형 컴퓨터에서도 전혀 버벅거림 없이 잘 돌아가는 걸 보면, 정말이지 최적화의 극치를 보여줬다고 생각합니다.\n  네이티브 앱이란? 운영체제 고유의 프레임워크를 사용하여 개발되어, OS의 기능과 자원을 가장 효율적으로 활용하는 애플리케이션을 의미합니다. 마치 그 운영체제만을 위해 태어난 것처럼, OS와 완벽하게 조화를 이루는 것이 특징이죠.\n  웹 기술 만능주의, 개발자들의 선택 'Electron'\n그런데 어느 순간부터 '네이티브 앱'이라는 단어는 점점 희미해지기 시작했습니다. 그 자리를 채운 것은 다름 아닌 웹 기술을 기반으로 한 앱들이었죠. 특히 Electron이나 PWA(Progressive Web Apps) 같은 기술들이 대세로 떠오르면서, 개발자들은 윈도우, macOS, 리눅스 등 각기 다른 운영체제별로 앱을 따로 만들 필요가 없어졌습니다.\n이게 왜 그렇게 매력적이었냐면, 한 번 HTML, CSS, JavaScript로 웹 앱을 만들면 Electron이 이 웹 앱을 마치 데스크톱 애플리케이션처럼 실행시켜 주기 때문이에요. Electron은 Chromium 브라우저 엔진과 Node.js 런타임을 통째로 앱에 포함시키는 방식인데, 덕분에 개발자들은 하나의 코드베이스만 관리하면 됩니다. 개발팀에 웹 개발자만 있어도 모든 플랫폼용 앱을 만들 수 있게 된 거죠. 반복 작업도 줄어들고, UI 변경도 훨씬 쉽습니다. 기존에 수많은 웹 라이브러리가 있다는 것도 엄청난 장점이고요.\n이런 장점들 덕분에 Slack, Discord, Figma의 데스크톱 클라이언트, Obsidian, Notion, 그리고 최근의 WhatsApp까지, 수많은 유명 앱들이 Electron이나 유사한 웹 기술을 택했습니다. 개발자 입장에서는 더할 나위 없이 편리한 선택지였던 거죠. 제 생각엔 이 흐름을 거스를 수 없었을 것 같아요. 그런데 말입니다, 개발자의 이런 편리함이 과연 사용자에게도 좋은 방향이었을까요?\n\n\n  사용자가 지불하는 '성능 세금': 앱이 무거워지는 이유\n아쉽게도, 개발자 편의성의 대가는 고스란히 사용자에게 '성능 세금'으로 부과되었습니다. Electron 앱은 기본적으로 자기만의 브라우저를 통째로 품고 있습니다. 여러 Electron 앱을 동시에 실행하면, 마치 여러 개의 크롬 브라우저를 띄워 놓은 것처럼 수많은 Chromium 인스턴스가 여러분의 PC 메모리를 점령하게 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 한두 개만 켜도 RAM 사용량이 확 오르더라고요.\n고성능 PC를 사용한다면 체감하기 어려울 수도 있지만, 보급형 노트북이나 오래된 컴퓨터에서는 그야말로 끔찍한 성능 저하를 경험하게 됩니다. 앱 실행 속도는 현저히 느려지고, UI 요소들이 네이티브 앱처럼 부드럽게 작동하지 않거나 시스템 테마와 동떨어지는 경우도 흔합니다. 키보드 단축키도 제멋대로인 경우가 있고요. 게다가 이렇게 여러 브라우저가 메모리에 상주하고 있으면 노트북 배터리 수명에도 치명적일 수밖에 없습니다.\n물론 모든 Electron 앱이 나쁘다는 건 아닙니다. 대표적인 예시가 바로 Visual Studio Code(VS Code)죠. VS Code는 Electron 기반임에도 불구하고 뛰어난 성능과 놀라운 최적화를 보여주는, 최고의 코드 편집기 중 하나입니다. 이 사례를 보면 Electron 자체가 문제가 아니라, 개발 과정에서 최적화에 대한 '관심'과 '노력'이 줄어들기 쉬운 환경이 조성되었다는 점이 더 큰 문제라고 생각해요. 편리함 뒤에 숨겨진 책임감의 부재랄까요?\n⚠️ 주의! 저사양 PC나 오래된 노트북 사용자라면 웹 기반 앱의 성능 저하를 더욱 크게 체감할 수 있습니다. 수많은 백그라운드 프로세스가 시스템 리소스를 잠식하고, 이는 느려진 반응 속도와 급격한 배터리 소모로 이어질 수 있어요.\n  마이크로소프트도 이 변화를 부추기고 있나?\n이런 흐름에 마이크로소프트 역시 크게 제동을 걸지 않았다는 점도 주목할 만합니다. 아니, 어쩌면 마이크로소프트 자체가 이러한 변화를 은연중에 부추기고 있는지도 모릅니다. Edge 브라우저의 엔진을 앱에 내장할 수 있는 WebView2 같은 기술을 제공하고 있고, 마이크로소프트 스토어에는 이미 웹 기반 Electron 앱들이 차고 넘치죠. 심지어 마이크로소프트의 자체 제품인 Teams나 Office의 일부 요소들도 웹 기술에 크게 의존하고 있습니다.\n엎친 데 덮친 격으로, 전통적인 윈도우 UI 프레임워크들은 시간이 갈수록 파편화되고 혼란스러워지고 있습니다. Win32, WPF, UWP, WinUI 3, 그리고 MAUI까지, 끊임없이 새로운 프레임워크가 등장하고 바뀌면서 소규모 개발자들이나 인디 개발자들이 윈도우 전용 코드베이스를 유지하는 것이 거의 불가능에 가까워졌어요. '내가 이미 React를 아는데, 굳이 XAML과 씨름할 필요가 있을까?' 하고 생각하는 게 어쩌면 당연한 일입니다.\n게다가 스토어에서 Electron 앱도 잘 받아주는데, 굳이 고생해서 네이티브 도구를 만들 이유가 없어지는 거죠. 과거 네이티브 윈도우 앱들은 셸 확장, 전역 단축키, 파일 연결, 드래그 앤 드롭, 알림 시스템, 심지어 작업 표시줄 통합 같은 시스템 기능들과 정말 유기적으로 연결되어 있었습니다. 이런 섬세한 통합성은 점점 더 획일화되는 웹 UI에서는 재현하기 어렵습니다. 잘 만들어진 네이티브 앱과 웹 기반 앱을 비교해 보면, 특히 저사양 하드웨어에서는 성능 차이가 극명하게 드러나는 걸 알 수 있어요.\n\n\n  그럼에도 불구하고, '진정한' 네이티브 앱은 살아있다!\n그럼에도 불구하고, 다행히도 여전히 훌륭한 네이티브 윈도우 앱들이 꾸준히 개발되고 유지되고 있습니다. Everything Search, ShareX, AutoHotKey, EarTrumpet 같은 도구들은 현대적인 네이티브 소프트웨어도 얼마든지 빠르고, 특정 기능에 집중하며, 운영체제에 완벽하게 통합될 수 있다는 살아있는 증거죠. 저도 이런 앱들을 써볼 때마다 '아, 이게 진짜 윈도우 앱이지!' 하고 무릎을 탁 치곤 합니다.\n이런 앱들은 불필요한 기능 없이 핵심적인 역할에 충실하며, 시스템 리소스를 최소한으로 사용합니다. 덕분에 아무리 오래된 PC에서도 쾌적하게 작동하죠. 이들이 보여주는 성능과 완성도는 웹 기반 앱들이 쉽게 따라올 수 없는, 네이티브 앱만의 고유한 강점이라고 생각합니다. 여전히 이런 노력을 기울이는 개발자분들께 정말 감사드리고 싶어요.\n  핵심 요약\n1. 과거의 네이티브 앱은 OS와 긴밀히 연동되어 놀라운 성능과 효율을 자랑했습니다.\n2. Electron 등 웹 기술은 개발자에게 막대한 편의성을 주었지만, 사용자는 무거운 앱으로 인한 성능 저하를 감수하게 되었습니다.\n3. 마이크로소프트의 정책과 파편화된 프레임워크 역시 웹 기반 앱 확산에 영향을 미쳤습니다.\n4. 여전히 훌륭한 네이티브 앱들이 존재하며, 사용자 인식 변화와 개발자의 노력으로 네이티브 앱의 가치가 재조명될 수 있습니다.\n결국, 기술 발전의 편리함과 사용자 경험 사이의 균형을 찾는 것이 중요합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: Electron 앱이 정말 그렇게 나쁜가요?\nA: Electron 자체는 개발 편의성을 제공하는 훌륭한 도구입니다. 하나의 코드베이스로 여러 플랫폼에 쉽게 배포할 수 있다는 점은 분명한 장점이죠. 하지만 개발자가 최적화에 덜 신경 쓰게 만들 수 있다는 점이 문제입니다. 잘 만들어진 Electron 앱은 훌륭한 성능을 보여주기도 합니다 (예: VS Code).\nQ: 네이티브 앱 개발은 왜 점점 줄어드나요?\nA: 주로 개발 비용과 복잡성 때문입니다. 여러 플랫폼에 맞춰 코드를 따로 작성해야 하고, 윈도우 UI 프레임워크의 파편화도 한몫합니다. 웹 기술은 한 번의 개발로 여러 플랫폼에 대응할 수 있어 경제적인 선택지로 여겨지기 때문입니다.\nQ: 일반 사용자가 네이티브 앱과 웹 기반 앱을 어떻게 구분할 수 있나요?\nA: 일반적으로 네이티브 앱은 시스템 리소스를 적게 사용하고, 빠르게 실행되며, OS 테마나 동작 방식에 더 통합된 느낌을 줍니다. 작업 관리자에서 프로세스 이름을 확인하거나(Chromium 관련 프로세스가 많다면 웹 기반일 확률이 높습니다), 앱의 '정보'에서 사용된 프레임워크를 찾아보는 방법도 있습니다.\nQ: 미래에 네이티브 앱이 다시 인기를 얻을 수 있을까요?\nA: 사용자들의 성능과 통합성에 대한 요구가 커지고, 개발자들이 최적화와 OS 통합의 중요성을 다시 인식한다면 충분히 가능성이 있습니다. 마이크로소프트의 정책 변화와 새로운 네이티브 개발 도구의 등장이 큰 영향을 미칠 것입니다. 결국 균형점이 중요하다고 생각합니다.\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"Electron 앱이 정말 그렇게 나쁜가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"Electron 자체는 개발 편의성을 제공하는 훌륭한 도구입니다. 하나의 코드베이스로 여러 플랫폼에 쉽게 배포할 수 있다는 점은 분명한 장점이죠. 하지만 개발자가 최적화에 덜 신경 쓰게 만들 수 있다는 점이 문제입니다. 잘 만들어진 Electron 앱은 훌륭한 성능을 보여주기도 합니다 (예: VS Code).\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"네이티브 앱 개발은 왜 점점 줄어드나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"주로 개발 비용과 복잡성 때문입니다. 여러 플랫폼에 맞춰 코드를 따로 작성해야 하고, 윈도우 UI 프레임워크의 파편화도 한몫합니다. 웹 기술은 한 번의 개발로 여러 플랫폼에 대응할 수 있어 경제적인 선택지로 여겨지기 때문입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"일반 사용자가 네이티브 앱과 웹 기반 앱을 어떻게 구분할 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"일반적으로 네이티브 앱은 시스템 리소스를 적게 사용하고, 빠르게 실행되며, OS 테마나 동작 방식에 더 통합된 느낌을 줍니다. 작업 관리자에서 프로세스 이름을 확인하거나(Chromium 관련 프로세스가 많다면 웹 기반일 확률이 높습니다), 앱의 '정보'에서 사용된 프레임워크를 찾아보는 방법도 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"미래에 네이티브 앱이 다시 인기를 얻을 수 있을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"사용자들의 성능과 통합성에 대한 요구가 커지고, 개발자들이 최적화와 OS 통합의 중요성을 다시 인식한다면 충분히 가능성이 있습니다. 마이크로소프트의 정책 변화와 새로운 네이티브 개발 도구의 등장이 큰 영향을 미칠 것입니다. 결국 균형점이 중요하다고 생각합니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. 이번 글은 Gemini CLI, SpecKit, Supabase, Vercel을 활용해 QnA 시스템을 구현하는 내용에 대해 작성한 글입니다.\nGemini CLI 설정부터 SpecKit을 사용하는 흐름, Supabase 설정 및 UI 개선하는 과정을 담았습니다.\n키워드 : Gemini CLI 사용법, Gemini CLI with SpecKit, Supabase, Vercel, Gemini Code Assist\n\n\nGemini CLI\n소개\nGemini CLI는 Google의 AI 모델(Gemini)을 CLI 환경에서 사용할 수 있게 해주는 개발자 도구\n최근 터미널 기반의 제품이 많이 나오는데, 직접 사용해보면 생산성이 많이 좋아지는 것을 느낄 수 있음\nGemini 모델의 장점 때문에 Gemini CLI를 쓰게 됨\n    \n(1) 긴 컨텍스트 : 컨텍스트를 많이 넣을 수 있기 때문에 복잡한 작업, 많은 컨텍스트가 필요할 때 유리\n(2) 가격 : Gemini 모델의 가격은 다른 모델의 가격 대비 엄청 저렴함(특히 Gemini Flash Lite가 저렴해서 자주 사용함)\n공식 문서, Docs\nGemini CLI 설치\nGemini CLI는 Node.js 환경에서 동작하므로, 사전에 Node.js가 설치되어 있어야 함\n    \n만약 Node가 설치되어 있지 않다면 Node.js 페이지를 확인해서 Node 설치\nnpm으로 글로벌하게 설치\n\n  npm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n\n    \nGemini CLI 실행\n터미널에서 gemini 입력 후 엔터\n    \n만약 첫 실행이면 인증 방식을 선택하게 됨\n구글 계정 로그인, API Key 방식, 구글 클라우드의 Vertex AI를 통해 인증할 수 있음\n저는 Gemini를 구독하고 있어서 구글 로그인으로 선택함\n\n/model을 입력하면 모델을 선택할 수 있음\n    \nPro (gemini-3-pro-preview, gemini-2.5-pro)로 설정\n\nGemini CLI 주요 명령어\n명령어\n      설명\n    \n/help\n      사용 가능한 명령어 목록 확인\n    \n/model\n      모델 선택 (gemini-3-pro 등)\n    \n/memory show\n      현재 로드된 GEMINI.md 내용 확인\n    \n/memory refresh\n      GEMINI.md 파일 다시 로드\n    \n/memory add <text>\n      메모리에 텍스트 추가\n    \n/chat\n      대화 저장/불러오기/공유\n    \n/chat save <tag>\n      현재 대화를 태그로 저장\n    \n/chat resume <tag>\n      저장된 대화 이어서 진행\n    \n/mcp\n      MCP 서버 목록 및 상태 확인\n    \n/tools\n      사용 가능한 도구 목록\n    \n/stats\n      토큰 사용량, 세션 시간 등 통계\n    \n/restore\n      체크포인트로 롤백 (파일 변경 전 상태)\n    \n/clear\n      터미널 화면 초기화 (Ctrl+L)\n    \n/compress\n      대화 컨텍스트를 요약해서 토큰 절약\n    \n/copy\n      마지막 응답을 클립보드에 복사\n    \n/settings\n      설정 편집기 열기\n    \nstats 입력시 아래와 같이 Session의 통계 정보를 제공함\n\nExtensions\n    \n다양한 Extensions이 존재하며, 설치하고 싶으면 아래와 같이 실행(나노바나나 Extension)\n\n  gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\n\n    \nGEMINI.md 설정\nGEMINI.md는 Gemini CLI에게 프로젝트 Context와 작업 규칙(Rules)을 알려주는 설정 파일\n    \n이 파일에 작성한 내용은 모든 대화에서 시스템 프롬프트처럼 적용됨\nGemini CLI는 여러 위치의 GEMINI.md를 자동으로 찾아서 합쳐줌\n    \n아래 순서대로 로드되며, 모든 파일의 내용이 합쳐짐. 같은 항목에 대해 충돌이 있으면 하위 파일이 우선 적용됨(프로젝트가 글로벌보다 더 우선 적용)\n\n  # 1) 글로벌(모든 프로젝트 공통) : 공통 규칙, 한국어 사용 등\n  ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md      \n\t\n  # 2) 프로젝트 루트 : 기술 스택, 구조 위주\n  /project-root/GEMINI.md \n\t\n  # 3) 하위 디렉토리(해당 폴더에서 작업할 경우)\n  /project-root/src/GEMINI.md\n\n    \n현재 로드된 컨텍스트는 /memory show 명령어로 확인할 수 있으며, CLI 하단에 로드된 파일 개수가 표시됨\nGEMINI.md에 자주 들어가는 내용\n    \n기술 스택 : Python 3.13\n코딩 컨벤션 : 네이밍 컨벤션\n프로젝트 구조 : 폴더 설명\n에러 처리 방식, API 호출 패턴\n금지 사항 : 특정 라이브러리 사용 금지\n참고 문서 : @로 외부 파일 import 가능\n다른 파일을 Import해서 불러오고 싶을 때는 @을 사용함. 프로젝트 문서나 스타일 가이드를 분리해서 관리할 때 유용함\n\n  # GEMINI.md \n\t\n  ## Project Context \n  @docs/architecture.md \n  @docs/api-spec.md \n\n    \nGEMINI.md를 수정했으면 /memory refresh로 반영해야 함\n컨텍스트가 길다고 좋은 것은 아니므로 이 파일도 계속 관리해야 함\n\n\nSpecKit을 활용한 SDD 개발\n소개\nSpecKit은 GitHub에서 만든 오픈소스로 SDD(Spec Driven Development) 도구\n    \nAI 코딩 에이전트(Gemini CLI, Claude Code 등)와 함께 사용하도록 설계됨\n만들어진 계기\n    \nAI에게 그냥 A 만들어줘라고 하면 의도와 다르게 나오거나 아키텍처가 엉망인 경우가 많음. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 SpecKit은 코드 작성 전에 Spec을 정의하고 이를 기반으로 AI가 구현하도록 유도함\n이 Spec을 사람이 리뷰하면 되고, 리뷰하는 과정도 이 도구 사용법 안에 자연스레 존재함\n    \n코드보다 이 Spec을 더 잘 관리하고, 잘 작성하는 것이 중요하다는 의견이 있는데, 저도 동의함. 기본적인 문서 작성이 더 중요해지는 시기\nWorkflow 흐름\n    \n크게 6단계로 설명할 수 있음\n(1) Specify : 기능 요구사항 정의(기술 스택이 아닌 무엇을 만들지)\n(2) Clarify : 애매한 부분, 의사결정이 필요한 부분을 질문하며 구체화\n(3) Plan : 기술 스택, 아키텍처 등 계획을 세움\n(4) Tasks : Plan을 기반으로 구현할 Task 생성\n(5) Analyze : Spec과 Task의 일관성 검증\n(6) Implement : Task 기반으로 코드 구현\nSpecKit 설치하기\nPython의 uv 설치\n\n  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n    \nSpecKit 글로벌 설치\n\n  uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n\n    \nSpecKit 프로젝트 설정\nSpecKit 프로젝트 초기 설정\n\n  specify init ask-kyleschool --ai gemini\n\n    \n만약 이미 폴더가 생성되어 있고, 현재 폴더에서 설정하고 싶은 경우\n\n  cd existing-project \n  specify init . --ai gemini\n\n    \n\n이제 .gemini 폴더와 .specify 폴더를 보면 SpecKit 관련 파일들이 생성된 것을 볼 수 있음\n\nGemini CLI에서도 커맨드가 보임\n\nSpecKit을 활용한 개발\n위에서 소개한 6단계를 실제로 진행\n단계\n      명령어\n      설명\n    \n1.

JSON 다운로드를 해두는 것을 추천(잃어버리지 않도록 주의. 다운로드 폴더에 그대로 두지 않기)\n\n이제 Supabase로 돌아와서 Authentication - Sign In / Providers - Google을 선택\n\nEnable Sign in with Google을 설정하고 위에서 만든 클라이언트 id와 클라이언트 secret 값을 붙여넣기\n    \n하단에 있는 Callback URL 값은 이후에 사용할 예정이므로 복사 클릭\n\n다시 구글 클라우드의 Client쪽에 다음과 같이 추가\n    \n승인된 JavaScript 원본 : 실행시킬 URL 입력. 지금은 배포하지 않고 제 로컬에서 실행할 예정이라 localhost:3000만 추가함\n        \n나중에 배포하면 배포한 URL 웹페이지를 입력하면 됨\n승인된 리디렉션 URI : 위에 Google 로그인에서 복사한 Callback URL 입력\n\n\n\n개발 결과 확인\n이제 인프라 설정이 완료되었으므로, 터미널에서 아래 명령어 실행해서 개발 결과 확인\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\nlocalhost:3000으로 접속하면 다음과 같이 뜸\n\n구글로 로그인을 시도하니 정상적으로 로그인 완료\n로그인 후 닉네임 설정을 하게 됨\n\n강의 페이지로 이동\n\n‘BigQuery 쿼리를 실행하기 위한 기본적인 쿼리 구성 요소를 알려주세요’라고 질문함\n\n그 결과 질문이 올라옴\n\n답변은 다음과 같이 달림. 단, 마크다운 설정이 필요할 것 같음\n\n만약 실행하는 과정에서 오류가 발생하면 Gemini CLI에게 오류를 보내고 수정하라고 가이드하면 됨. 만약 반복된다면 전체적으로 점검하라고 요청하는 것을 추천\n\n\nUI 개선\n새로운 Spec을 통해 디자인 개선하기\n기능 구현은 되었고, 디자인을 개선하기 위해 다시 Spec을 작성함\n\n위에서 진행한 것처럼 clarify, plan, tasks, analyze, implement를 실행한 후 기다림\n    \n이제 마크다운을 잘 표현하고, 디자인이 살짝 개선됨\n\n더 자세한 지시를 통해 디자인 개선하기\n만들어진 디자인이 마음에 들지 않아 어떻게 개선할지 고민하다가, Claude Code의 frontend-design 스킬을 참고해서 개선하라고 지시함\nGEMINI.md 파일에 아래 내용을 추가함\n\n  ## Frontend Design\n  - Please refer to @frontend-design.md when implementing frontend designs\n\n    \nGEMINI.md를 수정한 후, 해당 지시를 기반으로 디자인을 개선하라고 지시함\n\n처음 버전보다 더 세련된 느낌. 만약 내가 원하는 방향성이 있다면 디자인 레퍼런스를 구체적으로 줄수록 만족스러운 결과가 나올 수 있음\n\n\nGemini CLI에게 아이디어 문의\n이제 또 무엇을 하면 좋을지 아이디어를 물어봤더니, 좋은 아이디어를 줬음\n\n위 내용을 모두 모아서 하나의 Spec으로 정의해서 구현해달라고 지시함\n    \n강의 클릭시 대기 시간에 system_log 형식으로 구현함\n\n\nGemini Code Assist를 활용한 AI 코드 리뷰\n이제 GitHub에 Push함. 처음 작업이라 main에 바로 Push했으나, 그 이후엔 브랜치를 새롭게 만들어서 확인하는 것을 추천함\nGemini Code Assist를 설치하면 GitHub에서 Pull Request가 발생할 때 코드를 Gemini가 리뷰해줌. 이 설정을 해두는 것을 추천\n설정\nGemini Code Assist GitHub App 페이지 이동 -> Configure 클릭\n\n로그인을 완료한 후, 사용할 GitHub Repository를 추가\n\nAI 코드 리뷰 결과\n이렇게 설정한 후, Pull Request를 하면 아래와 같이 리뷰가 달림(아래 리뷰는 다른 Repo에서 Gemini Code Assist가 리뷰한 내용을 가져옴)\n\n\n\n\nVercel 배포\nSupabase와 Vercel이 잘 통합되어 있으므로, Vercel을 통해 배포하는 것을 추천\n이 부분에 대해 글을 작성할 예정은 아니였지만, 간단하게라도 가이드를 남겨봄\nVercel - New Project를 누르면 GitHub에서 Import를 할 수 있음\n\n\nSupabase URL, Anon Key를 추가하면 어렵지 않게 배포할 수 있음\nVercel 배포가 완료되면 새로운 URL이 생성됨. 이 URL을 Google Cloud OAuth(위에 소셜 로그인 부분)에 가서 승인된 JavaScript 원본에 Vercel URL을 추가해야 함\n그리고 Supabase에서도 URL 설정을 추가해야 함\n    \nSupabase > Authentication > URL Configuration에서 Site URL을 Vercel URL로 변경\n\n\n후기\nGemini CLI도 많이 사용하면서 도구에 적응하게 됨. 이런 도구들은 실제로 써보고, 피드백 루프를 돌리는 과정이 필요함\nGemini CLI의 Release Notes를 보면 새로운 기능들이 계속 생기고 있음. 앞으로 계속 더 발전할 것 같음\nClaude Code와 Gemini CLI 둘 다 사용하게 되었는데, 필요에 맞게 사용할 수 있도록 계속 시도해볼 예정\n    \nGemini CLI가 컨텍스트가 많기 때문에 핵심 AI 에이전트로 쓰고, Gemini CLI에서 Claude Code나 Codex를 실행하게 하는 것도 방법이고, 이미 이런 시도를 하는 분들이 계심\nAI 에이전트 도구들의 설정을 동일하게 저장해서 (예를 들어 AGENT.md를 만들어서) 관리하는 것이 필요할 듯. 새로운 도구로 이사하는 것이 번거롭게 느껴질 수 있음\n\n\n\n이 글은 GDE 프로그램에서 진행한 AI Sprint에 참여하며 작성한 글입니다.\n\nGoogle Cloud credits are provided for this project. #AISprint",

IMF 외환위기 상황에서 한국인들의 희망이었던 코리안 특급 박찬호의 전성 시대와 한일 월드컵 개최라는 두 가지 요인 때문이었죠.\n\n실의에 빠진 국민들에게 힘을 던져준 박찬호 / 사진: Str Old\n국민들은 더 이상 프로야구가 아닌 박찬호의 MLB 경기에 집중했습니다. 박찬호가 5일에 한 번씩 마운드에 오를 때 전 국민은 그의 투구를 지켜봤고 미디어에서는 그의 일거수 일투족을 다룬 수많은 기사와 리포트를 쏟아냈습니다. \n프로야구가 박찬호 신드롬으로 흔들리던 사이, 또 다른 거대한 파도도 몰려왔어요. 바로 월드컵이었죠. 2002 한일 월드컵 공동개최 확정 뉴스도 프로야구의 흥행을 위축시켰습니다. 1998년 프로야구는 관중 5,000명대에 머물렀지만, 프로축구 경기당 관중 수는 1만 4,000명으로 전년도에 비해 두 배나 늘어났습니다.\n\n올림픽 금메달과 롯데 열풍이\n불러온 반등의 시작\n침체되었던 프로야구 인기는 2007년부터 다시 상승세로 돌아섰습니다. 2006년부터 2009년까지 한국 야구가 유례없는 황금기를 맞았거든요. 한국 야구 국가대표팀은 2006년 WBC(월드베이스볼클래식) 4강을 시작으로, 2008년 베이징 올림픽 금메달과 2009년 WBC 준우승을 기록했죠.\n좋은 국제대회 성적 덕분에 한국 프로야구는 '명품 야구'라는 평가까지 받게 됐고, 특히 일본과의 경기에서 좋은 모습을 보이면서 야구 국가대표팀을 응원하는 '푸른 악마' 신드롬도 생겨났어요. 야구 국가대표팀 핵심 선수들이 대부분 한국 프로야구 무대에서 뛰고 있었다는 점도 큰 힘이 됐습니다. 이는 주요 선수들이 해외 리그에 진출한 축구 국가대표팀과는 다른 부분이었죠.\n국제대회 성적만큼 중요했던 것은 KBO의 구조적 변화였어요. 2011년부터 FA(자유계약선수) 제도*가 개선되면서 스타 선수들의 구단 이동이 활발해졌고, 팬들의 관심을 불러일으키는 계기가 됐습니다.\n* 일정 기간 이상 뛴 선수가 원하는 구단과 자유롭게 계약할 수 있는 제도\n\n2008 베이징 올림픽 우승을 차지한 한국 야구 국가대표팀 / 사진:Danny Moloshok\n전 경기 중계 시대 개막\n국제대회 성적만큼 중요한 변화는 2008년부터 프로야구 전 경기 중계가 이뤄졌다는 점이에요. 이전에는 각 방송사의 중계가 모든 경기를 커버하지 못했습니다. 그런데 2008년부터 Xports가 중계권을 얻으면서 케이블 4사(MBC ESPN, SBS Sports, KBS N Sports, Xports)가 4개 구장에서 열리는 8팀의 경기를 모두 중계할 수 있는 체제가 갖춰진 거죠.\n전 경기 중계 체제가 자리 잡으면서 프로야구는 미디어 콘텐츠로 다시 한번 진화하게 돼요. 팬들은 포털 사이트를 통해 무료로 모든 경기를 볼 수 있게 됐고, 다양한 경기 하이라이트 콘텐츠도 즐길 수 있었어요. 경기가 끝나자마자 방송사에서 모든 경기의 리뷰 프로그램을 제작할 수 있었고, 이를 통해 야구 전문 해설진들도 대중적 인지도를 얻게 됐습니다.\n이를 계기로 프로야구는 다시 500만 관중 시대를 열었습니다. 이때 2000년 이후 처음으로 가을야구에 진출한 '만년 하위팀' 롯데의 역할도 컸어요. 이때부터 프로야구는 코로나 팬데믹 기간을 제외하면 항상 평균 관중 1만 명 이상을 기록했죠.\n케이블 채널의 프로야구 중계 평균 시청률은 0.8~1.2%를 꾸준히 유지하고 있어요. 케이블 TV에서 인기 프로그램의 시청률이 1%대라는 점을 감안하면, 프로야구의 인기를 실감할 수 있습니다.\n\n뉴미디어 산업이 키운\n중계권 성장의 시대\n야구에 대한 전 국민적 관심 덕분에 2011년 프로야구 중계권 수입은 250억 원으로 상승했어요. 전년 대비 50% 늘어난 수치죠. 입장료 수입도 역대 최고인 551억 원을 넘겼고, 스폰서십 수입 역시 전년보다 40% 증가한 70억 원을 기록했습니다.\n1982년 2억 8,000만 원으로 출발했던 프로야구 중계권료는 2022년 기준 연간 760억 원까지 올랐어요. 이 중 뉴미디어 중계권료만 220억 원이었는데, 이 금액은 2022년 K리그(112억 원), 프로농구(30억 원), 프로배구(60억 원)의 중계권료를 모두 합친 것보다 더 많았죠.\n2024년 프로야구 미디어 시장은 또 한 번 도약을 이뤘습니다. 지상파와 스포츠 채널 방송사들은 경영 악화로 인해 2021년과 동일한 540억 원에 중계권 계약을 연장했지만, OTT 서비스 ‘티빙’을 운영하는 CJ ENM이 450억 원을 지불하면서 프로야구 뉴미디어 중계권 사업자가 됐어요.\n덕분에 2024년 방송사와 뉴미디어가 지불한 전체 중계권료는 990억 원까지 올랐어요. 이 금액은 10개 구단에 고르게 분배되기 때문에, 한 구단이 약 99억 원을 수입으로 가져가게 되죠. 이는 프로야구 톱클래스 선수 6~7명의 연봉을 합친 것과 비슷한 수준이에요. 프로야구 뉴미디어 중계권은 2026 시즌을 앞두고 다시 한 번 상승할 것으로 예상되고 있습니다.\n\n피크닉과 콘서트로 진화한\n관람 경험의 확장\n코로나 팬데믹은 야외 체험형 콘텐츠에 대한 관심을 크게 높였습니다. 프로야구는 이 변화의 가장 큰 수혜자였죠. 야구는 경기를 보면서 음식을 먹고 마시는 데 잘 어울리는 종목이에요. 여기에 프로야구 특유의 응원 문화가 더해지면서 매력이 커졌죠.\n이제 젊은 팬들은 야구장을 '야구만 보는 곳'으로 생각하지 않아요. 친구들과 야외에서 이야기하고, 응원가를 따라 부르고, 음식을 즐기는 피크닉과 콘서트가 결합된 다목적 공간에 가깝습니다. 즉, 팬들은 더 이상 ‘경기’를 소비하는 것이 아니라 '하루'를 소비하고 있는 셈입니다.\n젊은 팬들의 다양한 체험이 하나의 트렌드가 될 수 있었던 데에는 프로야구 경기장의 변화도 큰 역할을 했어요. 2010년부터 프로야구팀 홈구장 가운데 무려 5개가 신축됐고, 광주 기아 챔피언스 필드, 대구 삼성 라이온즈 파크, 대전 한화생명 볼파크 등은 지역의 랜드마크로 자리 잡았습니다.\n이런 변화 덕분에 젊은 세대는 야구장을 ‘한번쯤 가보고 싶은 공간’으로 인식하게 됐습니다. 게다가 신축 구장을 지은 구단들의 성적이 향상되면서 지역 팬들의 관람 욕구도 더 커졌어요. 프로야구 10개 구단의 총 입장 수입은 2022년 900억 원에서 2024년 1,594억 원으로 증가했고, 2025년에는 2,000억 원을 넘을 것으로 추정하고 있어요. \n\n2014년에 개장한 광주-기아 챔피언스 필드 / 사진: KIA 타이거즈\n유니폼을 포함한 구단 기념품 판매 수입도 크게 늘었습니다. 2024년 기아 타이거즈의 기념품 판매 수입은 전년 대비 무려 340% 증가했고, 이 가운데 팀의 인기 스타 김도영 선수 유니폼 판매액은 110억 원이나 됐어요.\n기념품 판매가 늘어난 데에는 프로야구의 폭발적 인기뿐 아니라, 아이돌 문화에 익숙한 MZ세대의 소비 패턴도 영향을 미쳤다는 분석이 많습니다. 무엇보다 중요한 점은 프로야구가 국내 다른 프로스포츠보다 여성 팬 비율이 훨씬 높다는 사실이에요. 2025년 프로야구 팬 가운데 여성 비율은 약 57.5%로 추산됩니다. 이 역시 기념품 판매 증가에 긍정적 영향을 미쳤죠.\n경기력 너머에서\n만들어진 팬덤의 힘\n일부 전문가들은 최근 한국 야구가 국제대회에서 저조한 성적을 기록했고, 프로야구 경기 퀄리티도 예전만 못하다는 점에서 우려를 표하고 있어요. 선수 수급 문제도 심각합니다. 고교야구가 쇠퇴하면서 유소년 야구 인구가 감소하고 있고, 주요 스타 선수들의 MLB 진출로 인한 공백도 우려되는 상황이죠. 경기 시간이 평균 3시간을 넘어서면서 짧은 콘텐츠에 익숙한 MZ세대의 집중력을 잃을 수 있다는 지적도 있습니다.\n그럼에도 프로야구의 인기는 당분간 이어질 가능성이 커요. 지금 야구장을 찾는 팬들은 경기 자체보다 경기장에서의 체험에 더 큰 관심을 기울이고 있기 때문이죠.\n2025년 KBO가 실시한 신규 관람자 조사에서도 이런 흐름이 확인됩니다. 신규 관람자들이 야구장을 찾은 가장 큰 이유는 응원 문화가 재미있을 것 같아서였고(33.8%), 그다음으로는 치맥 등 먹거리 문화를 경험해보고 싶어서였어요(19.9%). 다시 말해, 응원과 F&B 문화를 중심으로 한 야구장만의 체험 요소가 관람을 시작하게 만든 가장 큰 동기라고 볼 수 있어요.\n2025년 KBO가 공개한 포스트시즌 시청 데이터를 보면, 가을야구 누적 시청자 수는 2,687만 명을 넘었습니다. 산술적으로는 세대당 1명꼴로 올 시즌 가을야구를 시청한 셈이죠. 국내 어떤 프로 스포츠도 따라오기 어려운 이 엄청난 시청자 규모는, 프로야구가 젊은 세대를 넘어 중장년층까지 폭넓은 소구력을 갖고 있다는 뜻이기도 해요. \n프로야구 팬덤은 하루아침에 만들어진 것이 아닙니다. 40년 넘게 지역 정체성과 세대 경험, 그리고 진화하는 미디어 생태계가 만들어낸 구조적 성과죠. 1,200만 관중 시대의 비결은 바로 오랜 시간의 축적에 있습니다. 이렇게 쌓여온 문화가 앞으로 어떤 모습으로 진화할지 기대해봐도 좋겠습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 윤자영",
