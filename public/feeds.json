        "content:encodedSnippet": "Over the past couple of months, the Microsoft C++ team reached out to a series of customers voting on a suggestion ticket asking for Remote Linux Unit Testing support to understand their full set of interactions and needs with CMake and remote Linux scenarios in Visual Studio. After these discussions, we built out a backlog of work items to deliver on any pain points in their experiences.\nOne of the customers we interviewed and worked closely with during the process was Georg Zankl, a software developer for Genetec. Georg manages a project that uses dev containers and CMake. Our team helped Georg to bridge the gap in his developer workflows between Visual Studio and VS Code, so that his team can use Visual Studio and benefit from this more powerful IDE, while having a reproducible dev environment in VS Code.\nSpecifically, he previously could not use CMake Presets with his Docker environment in Visual Studio, and his CTests were not discoverable in the Test Explorer UI. However, after working with the Microsoft C++ team, his CMake builds are now enabled in dev containers in Visual Studio, allowing him to utilize Visual Studio’s powerful IntelliSense and features.\nBelow is an interview with Georg on his overall experience. Thank you, Georg, for working with us!\nWhat does your team do?\nWe develop and deploy algorithms based on Deep Learning and Computer Vision for real-time video processing.\nWe use very large open-source libraries for video processing, Computer Vision, and Deep Learning. Usually, we require customized configurations and builds of those all while continuously updating them. We rely on docker and vcpkg (with nuget caching) to get reproducible, efficient builds. The builds of our C++ code are generally integrated in containerized C# applications.\nWhat was your prior development environment for managing your projects?\nWe use Windows workstations but deploy on Linux. We’ve used VS Code as it has very good support for this kind of development across programming languages, due to the dev container support. On the other hand, Visual Studio is more powerful with its IntelliSense and extensions for C++. Visual Studio had support for dev containers, which was a step for us to utilize the powerful IDE features with our workflow. However, it had some issues which were preventing us from utilizing this IDE. Most notably, CTest tests running from the UI did not work in the container, and the CMake Presets that included a path in our docker image were not properly recognized by Visual Studio and instead reverted to a default configuration.\nWhat was your experience working with the Microsoft C++ team? How did it enable you to adopt Visual Studio?\nThe Microsoft C++ team was very proactive in enabling our workflows and addressed the dev container issues for us step-by-step.\nCMake Presets including paths in the docker image and CTests now work for our environments in Visual Studio. The Visual Studio team worked diligently to ensure dev container support was available for these scenarios.\nWe can now use Visual Studio with pretty much the same setup that we use in VS Code, while benefiting from the more powerful IDE. With the fixes applied, VS CMake builds in dev containers work very well for us. All our tooling (gcc, ninja, cmake, vcpkg, ..) is now validated and versioned through our baseline docker container and developers can get started right away with Visual Studio or VS Code, simply by opening the project with devcontainers.\nNow, Genetec (and you) has first-class VS support available for using dev containers with their CMake project. Visual Studio is now more versatile than ever for remote Linux C++ developers who are looking to have reproducible developer environments across their IDEs.\nPlease try out Visual Studio 17.11 Preview 2 for this latest dev container support.\nThe Microsoft C++ team would love to hear from any teams that work with our IDE and would like to see improvements with their remote Linux and/or CMake scenarios. Please reach out to us at visualcpp@microsoft.com.\nThe post Genetec uses Visual Studio, CMake, vcpkg, and Docker for remote Linux C++ development appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

When directly-referenced header files are not considered as context, GitHub Copilot hallucinates a non-existent FindFiles() function.\n\nAfter: Directly-referenced header files are considered as context for Github Copilot code completions\nNow, when directly-referenced header files are considered as context, Copilot correctly suggests an existing DoFileSearch() utility function declared in FileSearch.h.\n\nTo get started, make sure you’re using the GitHub Copilot extension version 1.205 or later and have an active GitHub Copilot subscription. You’ll also need the C/C++ extension version 1.21 or later with IntelliSense configured correctly. Version 1.21 of the C/C++ extension is currently in pre-release. Our team is committed to C++ Copilot support in both Visual Studio and VS Code, and similar support is coming to Visual Studio in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.12.\nContacts Us\nYour feedback helps inform our work to improve the Copilot experience for C++ developers in Visual Studio and VS Code.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By Jun He, Natallia Dzenisenka, Praneeth Yenugutala, Yingyi Zhang, and Anjali Norwood\nTL;DR\nWe are thrilled to announce that the Maestro source code is now open to the public! Please visit the Maestro GitHub repository to get started. If you find it useful, please give us a star.\nWhat is Maestro\nMaestro is a general-purpose, horizontally scalable workflow orchestrator designed to manage large-scale workflows such as data pipelines and machine learning model training pipelines. It oversees the entire lifecycle of a workflow, from start to finish, including retries, queuing, task distribution to compute engines, etc.. Users can package their business logic in various formats such as Docker images, notebooks, bash script, SQL, Python, and more. Unlike traditional workflow orchestrators that only support Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), Maestro supports both acyclic and cyclic workflows and also includes multiple reusable patterns, including foreach loops, subworkflow, and conditional branch, etc.\nOur Journey with Maestro\nSince we first introduced Maestro in this blog post, we have successfully migrated hundreds of thousands of workflows to it on behalf of users with minimal interruption. The transition was seamless, and Maestro has met our design goals by handling our ever-growing workloads. Over the past year, we’ve seen a remarkable 87.5% increase in executed jobs. Maestro now launches thousands of workflow instances and runs half a million jobs daily on average, and has completed around 2 million jobs on particularly busy days.\nScalability and Versatility\nMaestro is a fully managed workflow orchestrator that provides Workflow-as-a-Service to thousands of end users, applications, and services at Netflix. It supports a wide range of workflow use cases, including ETL pipelines, ML workflows, AB test pipelines, pipelines to move data between different storages, etc. Maestro’s horizontal scalability ensures it can manage both a large number of workflows and a large number of jobs within a single workflow.\nAt Netflix, workflows are intricately connected. Splitting them into smaller groups and managing them across different clusters adds unnecessary complexity and degrades the user experience. This approach also requires additional mechanisms to coordinate these fragmented workflows. Since Netflix’s data tables are housed in a single data warehouse, we believe a single orchestrator should handle all workflows accessing it.\nJoin us on this exciting journey by exploring the Maestro GitHub repository and contributing to its ongoing development. Your support and feedback are invaluable as we continue to improve the Maestro project.\nIntroducing Maestro\nNetflix Maestro offers a comprehensive set of features designed to meet the diverse needs of both engineers and non-engineers. It includes the common functions and reusable patterns applicable to various use cases in a loosely coupled way.\nA workflow definition is defined in a JSON format. Maestro combines user-supplied fields with those managed by Maestro to form a flexible and powerful orchestration definition. An example can be found in the Maestro repository wiki.\nA Maestro workflow definition comprises two main sections: properties and versioned workflow including its metadata. Properties include author and owner information, and execution settings. Maestro preserves key properties across workflow versions, such as author and owner information, run strategy, and concurrency settings. This consistency simplifies management and aids in trouble-shootings. If the ownership of the current workflow changes, the new owner can claim the ownership of the workflows without creating a new workflow version. Users can also enable the triggering or alerting features for a given workflow over the properties.\nVersioned workflow includes attributes like a unique identifier, name, description, tags, timeout settings, and criticality levels (low, medium, high) for prioritization. Each workflow change creates a new version, enabling tracking and easy reversion, with the active or the latest version used by default. A workflow consists of steps, which are the nodes in the workflow graph defined by users. Steps can represent jobs, another workflow using subworkflow step, or a loop using foreach step. Steps consist of unique identifiers, step types, tags, input and output step parameters, step dependencies, retry policies, and failure mode, step outputs, etc. Maestro supports configurable retry policies based on error types to enhance step resilience.\nThis high-level overview of Netflix Maestro’s workflow definition and properties highlights its flexibility to define complex workflows. Next, we dive into some of the useful features in the following sections.\nWorkflow Run Strategy\nUsers want to automate data pipelines while retaining control over the execution order. This is crucial when workflows cannot run in parallel or must halt current executions when new ones occur. Maestro uses predefined run strategies to decide whether a workflow instance should run or not. Here is the list of predefined run strategies Maestro offers.\nSequential Run Strategy\nThis is the default strategy used by maestro, which runs workflows one at a time based on a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. With this run strategy, Maestro runs workflows in the order they are triggered. Note that an execution does not depend on the previous states. Once a workflow instance reaches one of the terminal states, whether succeeded or not, Maestro will start the next one in the queue.\nStrict Sequential Run Strategy\nWith this run strategy, Maestro will run workflows in the order they are triggered but block execution if there’s a blocking error in the workflow instance history. Newly triggered workflow instances are queued until the error is resolved by manually restarting the failed instances or marking the failed ones unblocked.\n\nIn the above example, run5 fails at 5AM, then later runs are queued but do not run. When someone manually marks run5 unblocked or restarts it, then the workflow execution will resume. This run strategy is useful for time insensitive but business critical workflows. This gives the workflow owners the option to review the failures at a later time and unblock the executions after verifying the correctness.\nFirst-only Run Strategy\nWith this run strategy, Maestro ensures that the running workflow is complete before queueing a new workflow instance. If a new workflow instance is queued while the current one is still running, Maestro will remove the queued instance. Maestro will execute a new workflow instance only if there is no workflow instance currently running, effectively turning off queuing with this run strategy. This approach helps to avoid idempotency issues by not queuing new workflow instances.\nLast-only Run Strategy\nWith this run strategy, Maestro ensures the running workflow is the latest triggered one and keeps only the last instance. If a new workflow instance is queued while there is an existing workflow instance already running, Maestro will stop the running instance and execute the newly triggered one. This is useful if a workflow is designed to always process the latest data, such as processing the latest snapshot of an entire table each time.\nParallel with Concurrency Limit Run Strategy\nWith this run strategy, Maestro will run multiple triggered workflow instances in parallel, constrained by a predefined concurrency limit. This helps to fan out and distribute the execution, enabling the processing of large amounts of data within the time limit. A common use case for this strategy is for backfilling the old data.\nParameters and Expression Language Support\nIn Maestro, parameters play an important role. Maestro supports dynamic parameters with code injection, which is super useful and powerful. This feature significantly enhances the flexibility and dynamism of workflows, allowing using parameters to control execution logic and enable state sharing between workflows and their steps, as well as between upstream and downstream steps. Together with other Maestro features, it makes the defining of workflows dynamic and enables users to define parameterized workflows for complex use cases.\nHowever, code injection introduces significant security and safety concerns. For example, users might unintentionally write an infinite loop that creates an array and appends items to it, eventually crashing the server with out-of-memory (OOM) issues. While one approach could be to ask users to embed the injected code within their business logic instead of the workflow definition, this would impose additional work on users and tightly couple their business logic with the workflow. In certain cases, this approach blocks users to design some complex parameterized workflows.\nTo mitigate these risks and assist users to build parameterized workflows, we developed our own customized expression language parser, a simple, secure, and safe expression language (SEL). SEL supports code injection while incorporating validations during syntax tree parsing to protect the system. It leverages the Java Security Manager to restrict access, ensuring a secure and controlled environment for code execution.\nSimple, Secure, and Safe Expression Language (SEL)\nSEL is a homemade simple, secure, and safe expression language (SEL) to address the risks associated with code injection within Maestro parameterized workflows. It is a simple expression language and the grammar and syntax follow JLS (Java Language Specifications). SEL supports a subset of JLS, focusing on Maestro use cases. For example, it supports data types for all Maestro parameter types, raising errors, datetime handling, and many predefined utility methods. SEL also includes additional runtime checks, such as loop iteration limits, array size checks, object memory size limits and so on, to enhance security and reliability. For more details about SEL, please refer to the Maestro GitHub documentation.\nOutput Parameters\nTo further enhance parameter support, Maestro allows for callable step execution, which returns output parameters from user execution back to the system. The output data is transmitted to Maestro via its REST API, ensuring that the step runtime does not have direct access to the Maestro database. This approach significantly reduces security concerns.\nParameterized Workflows\nThanks to the powerful parameter support, users can easily create parameterized workflows in addition to static ones. Users enjoy defining parameterized workflows because they are easy to manage and troubleshoot while being powerful enough to solve complex use cases.\n\nStatic workflows are simple and easy to use but come with limitations. Often, users have to duplicate the same workflow multiple times to accommodate minor changes. Additionally, workflow and jobs cannot share the states without using parameters.\nOn the other hand, completely dynamic workflows can be challenging to manage and support. They are difficult to debug or troubleshoot and hard to be reused by others.\nParameterized workflows strike a balance by being initialized step by step at runtime based on user defined parameters. This approach provides great flexibility for users to control the execution at runtime while remaining easy to manage and understand.\n\nAs we described in the previous Maestro blog post, parameter support enables the creation of complex parameterized workflows, such as backfill data pipelines.\nWorkflow Execution Patterns\nMaestro provides multiple useful building blocks that allow users to easily define dataflow patterns or other workflow patterns. It provides support for common patterns directly within the Maestro engine. Direct engine support not only enables us to optimize these patterns but also ensures a consistent approach to implementing them. Next, we will talk about the three major building blocks that Maestro provides.\nForeach Support\nIn Maestro, the foreach pattern is modeled as a dedicated step within the original workflow definition. Each iteration of the foreach loop is internally treated as a separate workflow instance, which scales similarly as any other Maestro workflow based on the step executions (i.e. a sub-graph) defined within the foreach definition block. The execution of sub-graph within a foreach step is delegated to a separate workflow instance. Foreach step then monitors and collects the status of these foreach workflow instances, each managing the execution of a single iteration. For more details, please refer to our previous Maestro blog post.\nThe foreach pattern is frequently used to repeatedly run the same jobs with different parameters, such as data backfilling or machine learning model tuning. It would be tedious and time consuming to request users to explicitly define each iteration in the workflow definition (potentially hundreds of thousands of iterations). Additionally, users would need to create new workflows if the foreach range changes, further complicating the process.\nConditional Branch Support\nThe conditional branch feature allows subsequent steps to run only if specific conditions in the upstream step are met. These conditions are defined using the SEL expression language, which is evaluated at runtime. Combined with other building blocks, users can build powerful workflows, e.g. doing some remediation if the audit check step fails and then run the job again.\nSubworkflow Support\nThe subworkflow feature allows a workflow step to run another workflow, enabling the sharing of common functions across multiple workflows. This effectively enables “workflow as a function” and allows users to build a graph of workflows. For example, we have observed complex workflows consisting of hundreds of subworkflows to process data across hundreds tables, where subworkflows are provided by multiple teams.\nThese patterns can be combined together to build composite patterns for complex workflow use cases. For instance, we can loop over a set of subworkflows or run nested foreach loops. One example that Maestro users developed is an auto-recovery workflow that utilizes both conditional branch and subworkflow features to handle errors and retry jobs automatically.\n\nIn this example, subworkflow `job1` runs another workflow consisting of extract-transform-load (ETL) and audit jobs. Next, a status check job leverages the Maestro parameter and SEL support to retrieve the status of the previous job. Based on this status, it can decide whether to complete the workflow or to run a recovery job to address any data issues. After resolving the issue, it then executes subworkflow `job2`, which runs the same workflow as subworkflow `job1`.\nStep Runtime and Step Parameter\nStep Runtime Interface\nIn Maestro, we use step runtime to describe a job at execution time. The step runtime interface defines two pieces of information:\n\nA set of basic APIs to control the behavior of a step instance at execution runtime.\nSome simple data structures to track step runtime state and execution result.\n\nMaestro offers a few step runtime implementations such as foreach step runtime, subworkflow step runtime (mentioned in previous section). Each implementation defines its own logic for start, execute and terminate operations. At runtime, these operations control the way to initialize a step instance, perform the business logic and terminate the execution under certain conditions (i.e. manual intervention by users).\nAlso, Maestro step runtime internally keeps track of runtime state as well as the execution result of the step. The runtime state is used to determine the next state transition of the step and tell if it has failed or terminated. The execution result hosts both step artifacts and the timeline of step execution history, which are accessible by subsequent steps.\nStep Parameter Merging\nTo control step behavior in a dynamic way, Maestro supports both runtime parameters and tags injection in step runtime. This makes a Maestro step more flexible to absorb runtime changes (i.e. overridden parameters) before actually being started. Maestro internally maintains a step parameter map that is initially empty and is updated by merging step parameters in the order below:\n\nDefault General Parameters: Parameters merging starts from default parameters that in general every step should have. For example, workflow_instance_id, step_instance_uuid, step_attempt_id and step_id are required parameters for each maestro step. They are internally reserved by maestro and cannot be passed by users.\nInjected Parameters: Maestro then merges injected parameters (if present) into the parameter map. The injected parameters come from step runtime, which are dynamically generated based on step schema. Each type of step can have its own schema with specific parameters associated with this step. The step schema can evolve independently with no need to update Maestro code.\nDefault Typed Parameters: After injecting runtime parameters, Maestro tries to merge default parameters that are related to a specific type of step. For example, foreach step has loop_params and loop_index default parameters which are internally set by maestro and used for foreach step only.\nWorkflow and Step Info Parameters: These parameters contain information about step and the workflow it belongs to. This can be identity information, i.e. workflow_id and will be merged to step parameter map if present.\nUndefined New Parameters: When starting or restarting a maestro workflow instance, users can specify new step parameters that are not present in initial step definition. ParamsManager merges these parameters to ensure they are available at execution time.\nStep Definition Parameters: These step parameters are defined by users at definition time and get merged if they are not empty.\nRun and Restart Parameters: When starting or restarting a maestro workflow instance, users can override defined parameters by providing run or restart parameters. These two types of parameters are merged at the end so that step runtime can see the most recent and accurate parameter space.\n\nThe parameters merging logic can be visualized in the diagram below.\n\nStep Dependencies and Signals\nSteps in the Maestro execution workflow graph can express execution dependencies using step dependencies. A step dependency specifies the data-related conditions required by a step to start execution. These conditions are usually defined based on signals, which are pieces of messages carrying information such as parameter values and can be published through step outputs or external systems like SNS or Kafka messages.\nSignals in Maestro serve both signal trigger pattern and signal dependencies (a publisher-subscriber) pattern. One step can publish an output signal (a sample example) that can unblock the execution of multiple other steps that depend on it. A signal definition includes a list of mapped parameters, allowing Maestro to perform “signal matching” on a subset of fields. Additionally, Maestro supports signal operators like <, >, etc., on signal parameter values.\nNetflix has built various abstractions on top of the concept of signals. For instance, a ETL workflow can update a table with data and send signals that unblock steps in downstream workflows dependent on that data. Maestro supports “signal lineage,” which allows users to navigate all historical instances of signals and the workflow steps that match (i.e. publishing or consuming) those signals. Signal triggering guarantees exactly-once execution for the workflow subscribing a signal or a set of joined signals. This approach is efficient, as it conserves resources by only executing the workflow or step when the specified conditions in the signals are met. A signal service is implemented for those advanced abstractions. Please refer to the Maestro blog for further details on it.\nBreakpoint\nMaestro allows users to set breakpoints on workflow steps, functioning similarly to code-level breakpoints in an IDE. When a workflow instance executes and reaches a step with a breakpoint, that step enters a “paused” state. This halts the workflow graph’s progression until a user manually resumes from the breakpoint. If multiple instances of a workflow step are paused at a breakpoint, resuming one instance will only affect that specific instance, leaving the others in a paused state. Deleting the breakpoint will cause all paused step instances to resume.\nThis feature is particularly useful during the initial development of a workflow, allowing users to inspect step executions and output data. It is also beneficial when running a step multiple times in a “foreach” pattern with various input parameters. Setting a single breakpoint on a step will cause all iterations of the foreach loop to pause at that step for debugging purposes. Additionally, the breakpoint feature allows human intervention during the workflow execution and can also be used for other purposes, e.g. supporting mutating step states while the workflow is running.\nTimeline\nMaestro includes a step execution timeline, capturing all significant events such as execution state machine changes and the reasoning behind them. This feature is useful for debugging, providing insights into the status of a step. For example, it logs transitions such as “Created” and “Evaluating params”, etc. An example of a timeline is included here for reference. The implemented step runtimes can add the timeline events into the timeline to surface the execution information to the end users.\nRetry Policies\nMaestro supports retry policies for steps that reach a terminal state due to failure. Users can specify the number of retries and configure retry policies, including delays between retries and exponential backoff strategies, in addition to fixed interval retries. Maestro distinguishes between two types of retries: “platform” and “user.” Platform retries address platform-level errors unrelated to user logic, while user retries are for user-defined conditions. Each type can have its own set of retry policies.\nAutomatic retries are beneficial for handling transient errors that can be resolved without user intervention. Maestro provides the flexibility to set retries to zero for non-idempotent steps to avoid retry. This feature ensures that users have control over how retries are managed based on their specific requirements.\nAggregated View\nBecause a workflow instance can have multiple runs, it is important for users to see an aggregated state of all steps in the workflow instance. Aggregated view is computed by merging base aggregated view with current runs instance step statuses. For example, as you can see on the figure below simulating a simple case, there is a first run, where step1 and step2 succeeded, step3 failed, and step4 and step5 have not started. When the user restarts the run, the run starts from step3 in run 2 with step1 and step2 skipped which succeeded in the previous run. After all steps succeed, the aggregated view shows the run states for all steps.\n\nRollup\nRollup provides a high-level summary of a workflow instance, detailing the status of each step and the count of steps in each status. It flattens steps across the current instance and any nested non-inline workflows like subworkflows or foreach steps. For instance, if a successful workflow has three steps, one of which is a subworkflow corresponding to a five-step workflow, the rollup will indicate that seven steps succeeded. Only leaf steps are counted in the rollup, as other steps serve merely as pointers to concrete workflows.\nRollup also retains references to any non-successful steps, offering a clear overview of step statuses and facilitating easy navigation to problematic steps, even within nested workflows. The aggregated rollup for a workflow instance is calculated by combining the current run’s runtime data with a base rollup. The current state is derived from the statuses of active steps, including aggregated rollups for foreach and subworkflow steps. The base rollup is established when the workflow instance begins and includes statuses of inline steps (excluding foreach and subworkflows) from the previous run that are not part of the current run.\nFor subworkflow steps, the rollup simply reflects the rollup of the subworkflow instance. For foreach steps, the rollup combines the base rollup of the foreach step with the current state rollup. The base is derived from the previous run’s aggregated rollup, excluding the iterations to be restarted in the new run. The current state is periodically updated by aggregating rollups of running iterations until all iterations reach a terminal state.\nDue to these processes, the rollup model is eventually consistent. While the figure below illustrates a straightforward example of rollup, the calculations can become complex and recursive, especially with multiple levels of nested foreaches and subworkflows.\n\nMaestro Event Publishing\nWhen workflow definition, workflow instance or step instance is changed, Maestro generates an event, processes it internally and publishes the processed event to external system(s). Maestro has both internal and external events. The internal event tracks changes within the life cycle of workflow, workflow instance or step instance. It is published to an internal queue and processed within Maestro. After internal events are processed, some of them will be transformed into external event and sent out to the external queue (i.e. SNS, Kafka). The external event carries maestro status change information for downstream services. The event publishing flow is illustrated in the diagram below:\n\nAs shown in the diagram, the Maestro event processor bridges the two aforementioned Maestro events. It listens on the internal queue to get the published internal events. Within the processor, the internal job event is processed based on its type and gets converted to an external event if needed. The notification publisher at the end emits the external event so that downstream services can consume.\nThe downstream services are mostly event-driven. The Maestro event carries the most useful message for downstream services to capture different changes in Maestro. In general, these changes can be classified into two categories: workflow change and instance status change. The workflow change event is associated with actions at workflow level, i.e definition or properties of a workflow has changed. Meanwhile, instance status change tracks status transition on workflow instance or step instance.\nGet Started with Maestro\nMaestro has been extensively used within Netflix, and today, we are excited to make the Maestro source code publicly available. We hope that the scalability and usability that Maestro offers can expedite workflow development outside Netflix. We invite you to try Maestro, use it within your organization, and contribute to its development.\nYou can find the Maestro code repository at github.com/Netflix/maestro. If you have any questions, thoughts, or comments about Maestro, please feel free to create a GitHub issue in the Maestro repository. We are eager to hear from you.\nWe are taking workflow orchestration to the next level and constantly solving new problems and challenges, please stay tuned for updates.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "JetBrains celebrated 24 years this February! Now, the company comprises 2,200 employees, 40 products, 3M total customers, and 11.4M users who regularly use and trust our tools. But how did it all start? IntelliJ IDEA was the first flagship product we launched, but right after that came ReSharper, which is celebrating 20 years on the market this week!\n\n\n\n\nBack in 2004\nYou still can find this message on our support forum from July 21, 2004:\n\nWe are proud to announce that ReSharper 1.0 have just been released today.\nWell, since then, we created Grazie to help check the quality of our texts before we publish them and avoid grammar mistakes 😉. Grazie has been integrated into ReSharper as the main spell-checking engine since v2023.3. But the most important thing is that 20 years ago, one of JetBrains’ most popular and exceptional products was released! And it’s still evolving to this day – check out the timeline:\nRESHARPER 20 TIMELINE\nThe first release announcement was posted by the then ReSharper team:\n\nValentin Kipyatkov\nDmitry Shaporenkov\nOleg Stepanov\nAndrey Simanovsky\nEugene Pasynkov\nNikolay Pultsin\nSergey Coox\nDmitry Lomov\n\n\n\n\nMany of these people are still with JetBrains after all these 20 years! Hard to believe, right? But it’s true! Some of the others are now driving other market leaders to their success. But back then, all together, these people took a brave and unique step in our company history – they created a tool for another vendor ecosystem, relying on it as a foundation and doing their best to improve it in the only way they knew and could utilize themselves.\nWe used to say that ReSharper makes Visual Studio a much better IDE. And, due to our branding research, many .NET developers (40%) strongly agree with that. With all of its 2,200 on-the-fly code inspections for C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, and other technologies, as well as quick-fixes, 60+ handy refactorings and 450+ context actions, unique guidance throughout the standards, and best coding practices, ReSharper is there to set the .NET development standard for all developers and other tools.\nDid you know that…\nReSharper was not just a pioneer product, it also served as the main breadwinner for JetBrains for several years in a row and influenced .NET and other ecosystems a lot through these years.\nWe’ve included all the major milestones in the timeline, but we also want to share a few fun facts from our long history.\nDid you know that there was almost a ReSharper IDE back in 2005?\nAfter the release of Visual Studio 2005 and C# 2.0, plans to release a ReSharper IDE were scrapped due to the significant workload of building it from scratch in C#. Because ReSharper’s sales as a Visual Studio extension were growing and the Visual Studio Marketplace was expanding, we decided to focus on improving the existing extension. We never lost sight of our vision to create a .NET IDE, which was later achieved in the form of JetBrains Rider.\nSome code from the ReSharper IDE project remained in use for a long time, including the standalone app interface shell (tool windows and editor) that’s partially used in dotPeek, dotTrace, dotMemory, and dotCover, as well as a unit test runner, and an algorithm for diff comparisons in solution files.\n\n\n\n\nDid you know the ReSharper team once used an external utility app to tackle the limitations of the 32-bit Visual Studio process?\n\nReSharper faced memory limitations in Visual Studio, restricted to a few hundred MB, which was inadequate for complex projects. Additionally, .NET’s 16 MB block memory allocation caused severe fragmentation, leaving few continuous free blocks. To address this, Leonid Shalupov developed an app that launched before Visual Studio, intercepting VirtualAlloc/VirtualFree system calls to reduce fragmentation. The ReSharper Support team provided this app to customers until Visual Studio updates resolved the issue.\nDid you know that there is a Clippy extension for ReSharper?\nWith support for Office 2003 coming to an end, we decided to offer Clippy another job in ReSharper. What started as an April Fool’s Day joke actually became a working extension, which you can watch in action in a screencast by its author, Matt Ellis.\n\n\n\n\nAppreciations\nDuring the Oscar award ceremony speech, actors and actresses, filmmakers, producers, and others express gratitude to the audience, acknowledge the award recipient’s achievements, and inspire others. We want to follow this tradition here as well.\nFirst, we’d like to thank Microsoft. Without Visual Studio, there would be no ReSharper. And that means no Rider, dotTrace, dotMemory, dotCover, nor many other tools born from that experience at JetBrains. Visual Studio is the product that set the bar for us and made it possible for us to drive ReSharper’s innovations for years. And we are grateful to have such an inspiring companion! If we could invite one best friend to this birthday party, that would be you, our beloved Microsoft. 🎂\nSecond, we want to say a huge thank you to the whole JetBrains team. For the inspiration, dogfooding, critique, crazy ideas, and fantastic execution. These people not only bring you new versions of C# and smart AI actions, integrate essential tools, and do amazing demos teaching you the best .NET practices, they also create fun quizzes – like this one hidden in the C# example on the JetBrains Mono page, for example.\nLast but not least, we’d like to thank all our users for being with us, many for as long as 20 years. It’s an incredible feeling to keep seeing messages from developers who have been with us for years now. And we would love to tell you all in person today just how much we appreciate your support and trust. Please continue communicating your excitement, inspiration, and (of course) pain points to us, throwing out ideas, and triggering reminders for things we might have forgotten.\nA recent ReSharper brand survey we ran made some of you worry about our plans for ReSharper’s future. But we want to assure you that it’s not going anywhere. The way the .NET developers community sees ReSharper makes us think we are on the right track. The majority of the people we reached out to said:\n“A tool powered by the ReSharper code engine is the most productive tool for .NET developers.” JetBrains Rider, Fleet, Qodana, AI Assistant for Visual Studio confirms that. And we keep brainstorming new ideas. Have some of your own? Share them with us!\n“ReSharper serves as an inspiration for Visual Studio.” And we are happy to perform this role! We know that with Visual Studio, our ideas and vision will reach a wider audience. Guiding the whole community through the tool is an achievement that not that many vendors can boast.\n“ReSharper helps you learn C#.” With many teachers and educators working on the team, this is essential! Just check out our recent series on C# 12 (Primary Constructors, Interceptors, Alias Any Type, Collection Expressions).\nWe know there are things you expect from us, things we should change or improve, and things we want to achieve with ReSharper in the future. And we hope that, for many years to come, we will keep shaping .NET developers’ habits. Check this timeline to see how it all started and what it’s going to look like in the nearest future:\nRESHARPER 20 TIMELINE\nLet us know in the comments if you want us to add something or if you found any mistakes on this timeline. If we pick your story to be featured, you’ll get a ReSharper T-shirt or a voucher for the JetBrains Merch Store!\nTo wrap up, a few words from our team members:\nSergey Coox, ex-.NET Department Lead in JetBrains, Principal Engineer at JetBrains\nBy the time I joined JetBrains in 2004 to create a C# IDE, I’d been programming in C++ for 5–6 years. So, it was more logical for me to develop my new project in C++ and not in C#, which I didn’t know at that time. Also, C# was still quite young and less powerful than now. But developing in C# with ReSharper was such a pleasure that I started easily diving into C# and never regretted it. ReSharper 1.0 fully justified our company motto at that time, “Develop with pleasure!”, and stayed true to it throughout these past 20 years. Many ReSharper features became an industry standard and entered other languages and products.\nReSharper always cares about the details, and that’s what makes it unique among the others. Maybe “Details matter!” will become our new motto for the whole industry, thanks to ReSharper!\nAleksandr Shvedov, Team Lead in the IDE Core (Language support) team at JetBrains\nThe reason I started using ReSharper was the mind-blowing “smartness” of the IDE – ReSharper was catching the bugs in my code at the speed of thought, suggesting ways to make my code clearer and more concise in the process. It felt almost like the whole software developer job was about to be completely automated pretty soon.\nI was also fascinated by the people who managed to build this kind of experience. Luckily enough, I was noticed by the ReSharper team members and eventually joined the team, where I got to work alongside the smartest and most inspiring people I know. For me, the “smartness” of ReSharper’s features turned into an infinite sequence of challenging technical tasks in a quite complex domain. During my 13-year journey at JetBrains, we implemented countless IDE features, survived the pressure from our competitors, successfully adapted new .NET technologies, and influenced other JetBrains IDEs.\nDuring those years, the world has changed a lot. Many of the things that felt “smart” back in the day have now become the standard for IDE tools we use today. However, the window of opportunities to innovate in IDE tools is wider than ever. With the rapid evolution of programming languages, new hardware, new UI/UX ideas, the ML & AI revolution, and remote/collaborative/cloud development – I’m very excited to keep pushing our .NET IDEs forward in this new world!\nMaria Pleskunina, Support Engineer in .NET Support at JetBrains\nTwelve years ago, I discovered ReSharper while starting my C# development journey. Back then, I was amazed at how much better my code could look by using the quick fixes suggested by the tool. I felt proud that my name, as the author, would be next to such polished written code. A while later, I found myself on the ReSharper team.\nNow, I understand the impact ReSharper has had on the development world as a whole. It boosts developer productivity, enhances code quality, and allows developers to focus on solving complex problems without wasting energy on housekeeping. As one of our users said: “ReSharper has made us lazy, and we want more”. And that’s exactly how it is!\nI’m proud to be part of a team dedicated to improving ReSharper. Thanks to everyone who contributes to this incredible tool, especially our users. Working alongside such talented individuals worldwide is a privilege. I wish our team to continue to create magic and inspire developers around the world.\nMatt Ellis, Head of .NET Developer Advocacy Team at JetBrains\nI first encountered ReSharper while working as a developer, but I didn’t get what the fuss was about until I was pair programming with someone who really knew how to use it. My immediate reaction was an amazed “How did you do that?”, and like the rest of the team, I was soon obsessed with discovering new features, swapping keyboard shortcuts, and “coding to green” – aiming for that green check mark to show we’d evaluated all of ReSharper’s suggestions.\nVery quickly, I became interested in the technology that powered ReSharper and started maintaining the xUnit.net test runner plugin. It was easy to see how the products were so smart and innovative. After joining JetBrains as a developer advocate, I could see that the main reason for that is that the people are just as smart and innovative and just as obsessed with providing a great developer experience as I was with using it. If there’s one thing better than JetBrains products, it’s JetBrainers.\nDmitry Matveev, Technical Writer at JetBrains\nI join my colleagues in expressing appreciation for the incredible ReSharper team I’ve had the pleasure and honor of being part of. I want to take this opportunity to extend my thanks to our users for the invaluable feedback provided over the years. Your sophisticated insights have been instrumental in identifying and rectifying a lot of difficult-to-spot edge-case scenarios, which has immensely improved ReSharper’s overall performance and functionality.\nWe have many diligent users whose names have become familiar to everyone on the team. We often mention these users in our internal meetings, and everyone instantly knows who they are. They’re more than just users; they’re a vital part of our development process. Once again, a huge thanks to all of our users. Your active involvement and commitment truly make a significant difference.\nSlava Tutushkin, Software Developer at JetBrains\nThe main reason I was really unhappy having to switch to C# 1.0 as my main development language was the lack of something like IntelliJ IDEA for C#. A few moments later, and the world became a much better place to live: we got all that intelligence (and even more) with ReSharper 1.0, while being able to continue to use VS. I started converting everyone around me to JetBrains adepts. After some time it became evident to me that just using ReSharper was not enough, so I made the life-changing decision to join the ReSharper team.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As cloud technologies and containerization evolve, we enter a new era of software development where flexibility, scalability, and efficiency become key requirements for any project. Dev Containers, or development containers, represent an approach to creating developer workspaces that allows you to focus on the code while worrying less about dependencies and surrounding infrastructure. This tool opens new horizons for simplifying development and ensuring projects’ consistency throughout their lifecycle.\nWhat are Dev Containers?\nDev Containers are Docker containers containing everything necessary for software development, including IDEs, specific software, tools, libraries, and even configured services, in an isolated environment that can be easily transferred and launched on any computer or cloud infrastructure. This solution allows developers and teams to abstract from the specifics of their operating system and maximally approximate the development conditions to the productive environment.\nIn simpler terms, they`re Docker containers (run locally or remotely) that include your project, IDE, and everything needed for development. The container’s settings are defined in a devcontainer.json file. If dependent containers are needed, for example, with databases or other services, Compose is supported. The Docker container can be launched from existing Docker images or built using a Dockerfile.\nAdvantages of using Dev Containers\nEnvironment consistency. Whether you are at the start of development or in the process of migrating an existing project, Dev Containers ensure that every team member works in an identical environment. This eliminates the “it works on my machine” problem when an application behaves differently on different machines.\nQuick workspace setup. Project launch and setup are reduced to a few commands, allowing new employees to start almost instantly and minimizing the time spent on costly environment setup.\nSecurity and isolation. Each Dev Container is fully isolated from your operating system, facilitating experimentation with new tools and technologies without affecting the settings or compatibility of your current tooling.\nEase of maintenance and updates. Updating tools and dependencies in a containerized environment does not require the lengthy and complex procedures often associated with traditional working environments.\nRemote development capability. The container can be run in a remote environment, and its resources and capabilities become available during development.\nGetting started with Dev Containers\nTo start with Dev Containers on your computer, you need:\nGit 2.25+\nDocker (if you plan to work only with Docker on a remote server, Docker CLI is sufficient)\nJetBrains IDE or JetBrains Gateway\nIf you want to run a Dev Container on a remote host, you’ll also need:\nLinux (including Linux on WSL2)\nOpenSSH Server with the option to connect from the client machine\nDocker with user-level rights\nDoes the project need to be prepared to run in a Dev Container?\nIf you are just starting to work with Dev Containers, there’s no need to initially configure anything in your project or worry about projects that do not yet support Dev Containers. Your JetBrains IDE will recognize that the project is not set up for Dev Containers and will offer a convenient wizard to help you select the necessary environment for launching the project. The Git-cloned project or the mounted project will be mapped to the user’s directory within the Dev Container.\nSubsequently, you can fine-tune all necessary Dev Container environment parameters in the devcontainer.json configuration file.\nIf devcontainer.json is located in one of the standard places, it will be automatically found by the IDE when creating a Dev Container:\n.devcontainer/devcontainer.json\n.devcontainer.json\n.devcontainer/<folder>/devcontainer.json (where <folder> is a sub-folder, one level deep)\nIn all these cases (unless otherwise defined in devcontainer.json) – the root of the Git-cloned project or the root of the mounted project will be mounted to the root of the project in the Dev Container.\nWe also support locating devcontainer.json in any project folder, for example:\ninfra/devcontainer.json\nservice1/devcontainer.json\nservice2/devcontainer.json\nThis is useful when working with monorepos containing microservices in different programming languages (requiring different environment settings) or those involving employees with different roles – developers, SRE/DevOps, testers, documentators, etc. In this case, when creating a Dev Container, you will need to explicitly specify where devcontainer.json is relative to the project root (through Specify Path). At the same time, the folder containing devcontainer.json (unless otherwise defined) will be mounted to the root of the project in the Dev Container.\nCreating your first Dev Container by cloning your project\nOpen JetBrains Gateway or the Welcome Screen in any JetBrains IDE.\nGo to the Dev Containers section and click on New Dev Container.\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a Dev Container from a VCS or local project.\nIn this example, we will create a Dev Container from a VCS project.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Docker section, you can choose where to create the Dev Container. The local Docker is offered by default, but you can click on “…” and add additional Docker servers from the cloud or WSL, for example, and set up the connection via SSH.\nIn the next section, we will discuss cases where this is useful.\nIn the Git Repository section, insert a git@ or https:// link to clone the repository into the Dev Container. Note that when cloning via SSH, you must have access to the cloned repository. Remember to add your key if you have not already done so.\nIn our first example, we will use the repository git@github.com:devcontainers/spec.git, where there are no specific configurations for Dev Containers – it could be any of your repositories.\n\n\n\n\nAfter adding, you can select the necessary Git branch (we will use main).\n\n\n\n\nIf there are no Dev Container configurations in standard places in the project (and no non-standard placement of devcontainer.json is explicitly stated via Specify Path), then in the next step, you will be prompted to choose a template for building the Dev Container.\nTo continue, press Build Container And Continue.\n\n\n\n\nThe Dev Container starts being built in the previously selected Docker location. A necessary temporary directory structure is created. Then, Git sparse-checkout is performed to try to find devcontainer.json metadata in standard locations (or explicitly specified non-standard ones).\nIf metadata is not found, as in our example, a Create Dev Container Configuration wizard opens, where you can choose the necessary configuration and options:\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the required configuration, the Dev Container starts being built. This is very similar to the way a typical Docker container is built, except here, the configuration described in the template or devcontainer.json metadata is applied, and the source texts are cloned into the container.\nIf the building process is successful, you will be able to choose the necessary IDE backend, which will be installed in the container and launched (even if not installed locally). You don’t necessarily have to make this selection every time – you can specify your IDE in devcontainer.json itself, and then that specific backend IDE will be launched automatically.\n\n\n\n\nAfter selecting the necessary IDE, click Continue. The necessary IDE backend will be downloaded (if it hadn’t been downloaded and cached previously), the container will be launched, and the IDE frontend (Gateway or Welcome Screen) will automatically connect to the IDE backend in the container.\n\n\n\n\nNow, you can start coding!\nFrom an architectural point of view, this works as shown here (if you are creating a Dev Container in Docker on a local machine):\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create a Dev Container in Docker on a remote machine (or in WSL with Docker and openssh-server installed), it works like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe IDE backend is launched in the container, and the source code from the specified repository is cloned. The IDE client connects to the backend, forming a Remote Development variant for working in the container (IDE Split Mode). When the frontend and backend communicate, a very efficient RD protocol is used – Rider has used the same protocol for many years – providing a local experience during remote development.\nIf you need to reconnect to the Dev Container, you can do so with one click from the Gateway or JetBrains IDE Welcome Screen. From here, if necessary, you can rebuild or remove Dev Containers.\n\n\n\n\nWriting a Dev Container in a local project and launching with source texts mounted\nOpen any of your local projects in a JetBrains IDE. In the context menu at the project root, click New| .devcontainer.\n\n\n\n\nYou will be offered a choice of templates from which you can create a devcontainer.json file. Let’s choose, for example, the Docker in Docker template, which allows working with deeper containers inside the container.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to use templates, you can simply create a devcontainer.json file with the necessary content (pay attention to naming rules for auto-discovery in the repository).\nThe minimum necessary options for building are the container’s name and the name of the image from which it needs to be built.\n{\n\n name: \"Examples of Dev Containers\",\n\n image: \"ubuntu:latest\"\n\n}\nTo build the Dev Container, click on the gutter (the blue Dev Container icon next to the code), select Create Dev Container and Mount Source…, and then choose the IDE that you need in the container. \nThe Dev Container will be built and launched, and you will connect to the container.\n\n\n\n\nThe Mount Sources mode is convenient for debugging Dev Containers but is not recommended for permanent use due to the slower disk performance compared to Clone Sources… mode, which is recommended by default.\nThe first time any Dev Container is launched, the IDE backend is downloaded. When the same Dev Container is used again, downloading is not required. You can view the list of downloaded backends in the Manage Dev Container Backends section.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nMore information on the Dev Containers specification can be found on the containers.dev website and guides for using it can be found in the official documentation. In the following articles, we will take a more detailed look at devcontainer.json directly, with Dockerfile, Compose, and features, as well as writing the features themselves. We will also look at how to define IDE settings in the customizations section.\nIf you have questions about using Dev Containers, leave a comment. In subsequent articles, we’ll try to answer the most popular questions. If you have encountered a problem, write to us, and we’ll gladly help.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Learning is a never-ending journey, or at least it should be. It can be frustrating starting learning to program, and becoming really good at it is even more challenging. However, learning a skill that others may not have the patience to acquire is what makes coders so inherently unique. In this blog post, we’ll look at some of the best strategies and resources available for learning programming with JavaScript if you don’t have any previous programming experience.\nWhy learn JavaScript?\nThere are lots of programming languages out there, each with its own unique approach and advantages for learning:\nIf you want to challenge yourself with something that’s difficult to master – C\nIf you want a really high-paying job – Java\nIf you want to work in a startup – Ruby\nIf you want an all-round language that’s easy to learn – Python\n\n\n\n\nBut if you want all the above… JavaScript is the obvious choice. There are several advantages to starting your learning journey with JavaScript. First, its straightforward syntax makes it ideal for beginners, but it isn’t just a beginner language – its versatility is practically endless. It drives web frontends but can also support backend development. The immediate feedback you get from developing frontends keeps the learning process engaging and rewarding due to its visual nature. \nAdditionally, JavaScript is highly sought after in the tech industry. According to the 2023 Developer Ecosystem Survey, JavaScript has been the most commonly used programming language for the seventh consecutive year, with over 61% of developers using it regularly. This consistent demand translates into abundant job opportunities, making JavaScript a great choice for anyone entering the field of programming. Another benefit worth mentioning is that JavaScript runs everywhere, so knowing it means you can write everything from backend and frontend to IoT and mobile apps.\nJavaScript learning path\nTo learn JavaScript effectively, you’ll need to touch upon each of the different concepts that make up the language. If you are looking for a step-by-step roadmap to guide you through this process, there are some incredible roadmaps available on Roadmap.sh that will help make sure you don’t miss anything important along the way. Later in this blog post, we’ll cover other resources, such as course and book recommendations.\n\n\n\n\nThis is how it is organized. The original has links to the resources for each topic and lets you track your progress.\nLearn the fundamentals\nThe fundamental skills you’ll need to learn to code effectively with JavaScript are as follows:\nBasic syntax: Ever wondered why developers start out with a “Hello, World!” program? They do it because it demonstrates the syntax of a language firsthand. \n\n\n\n\n// the hello world program\nconsole.log('Hello World');\nVariables: Variables are used to hold data values. It is foundational for everything else. How to declare and initialize variables using the keywords let, const, and var. \nData types: JavaScript offers several data types, including the primitive types string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and object. \nType casting: Everything in JavaScript is a string. Being able to cast them to a type explicitly can save you a world of trouble.\n\nData structures: At some point, you’ll need to store your data in a way that allows you to efficiently access and modify it. You should know how to create and manipulate arrays.\nControl flow: The order in which statements are executed is referred to as the “control flow”. In JavaScript, you have switch statements, for and while loops, if-else statements, and others available to you.\nLoops: There are different types of loops for different purposes – learn them all, and you’ll be unstoppable. Unlike your loops, hopefully, as otherwise, you’ll never hear the end of it.\nExpressions and operators: JavaScript expressions and operators include assignment, comparison, arithmetic, logical, string, ternary, and more. At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. \nFunctions and methods: Functions are pieces of code written to perform a particular task. They’re typically created so you can reuse them and invoke them from anywhere in your code when needed.\nLearn intermediate concepts\nOnce you have the fundamentals down, it’s time to move on to some more advanced concepts within the language. You’ll want to make sure you understand the following:\nStrict mode: There’s a restricted variant of JavaScript you can opt in to. It has different semantics to regular JavaScript code and will throw errors that would otherwise be silent. \nThe this keyword: The this keyword is an important concept that you’ll need to wrap your head around in JavaScript. It refers to an object, but it will refer to different objects depending on how it’s used. \nAsynchronous programming: Asynchronous programming enables programs to start tasks while still remaining responsive to other events, rather than having to wait for tasks to be finished. \nWorking with APIs: APIs can take your projects to the next level by adding incredible functionality. Sooner or later, you’ll need to learn how to interact with them.\nClasses: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. The class construct introduces new features which are useful for object-oriented programming.\nVersion control: You’ll need a basic understanding of Git and version control. Unless you’re an adrenaline junkie, that is.\nDebugging: When things don’t work, you’ll need to get into the code and figure out how to troubleshoot what’s gone wrong – otherwise known as debugging.\n\nBecome an expert\nIf you want to make a career out of JavaScript development, then you’ll need to continue to learn and grow as a developer. JavaScript will take years to master completely, but there are things you can do to make sure you continue to grow in this field.\nLearn frameworks and libraries: Now you can develop with JavaScript. The next step to becoming an expert is to add another layer on top by using a framework like React, Angular, or Vue. These are currently the most popular frameworks for JavaScript.\n\n\nStay up to date: The JavaScript ecosystem is evolving, and although not quite as rapidly as it once was, you’ll need to keep up with the changes in order for your code to run smoothly. There are some great resources you can follow to make sure you stay up to date and at the top of your game when it comes to JavaScript.\nNewsletters:\nJavaScript Weekly: This newsletter is sent out once a week or so and covers everything from the latest developments in the ecosystem to interesting blog posts from the community. \nBytes: This hilarious newsletter features news from across the JavaScript ecosystem.\nSurveys:\nJavaScript Rising Stars: This annual survey can help you get a good overview of the JavaScript landscape and what other people in the community are doing.\nThe State of Developer Ecosystem Survey: This is an annual report that looks at how the development landscape is changing year after year.\nState of JavaScript: This is another annual survey – one that can help you understand the JavaScript landscape. \nStack Overflow Developer Survey: This is one of the largest annual developer surveys conducted. It can be a great resource for keeping up with the latest trends and best practices in development.\nPractice problem solving: Practice makes perfect when it comes to learning JavaScript. There are several ways you can practice. One great way to practice, though, is to solve problems.\n\n\n\n\nLeetCode provides great algorithmic problems to help you develop your problem-solving skills. There are also interview-type questions to help you prepare for stressful job interview scenarios and coding competitions if you need that extra boost of adrenaline.\nHackerRank offers various challenges, including programming problems, algorithms, and data structures. The problems are categorized based on difficulty, programming language, and domain.\nCodewars is a coding challenge site that focuses on creative coding problem-solving. The problems are categorized based on difficulty, programming language, and domain. It’s community-driven and very interactive.\nStart developing projects\nThe only way to truly learn and understand something is through practice. Otherwise, you run the risk of getting stuck in the dreaded “tutorial hell”. Working through the process, making mistakes, and realizing you don’t know what you don’t know is pivotal to becoming a good programmer. Here are some project ideas you can develop from scratch. \nProject one: a personal portfolio website\nA great first project to put time and effort into is creating a website for yourself. This doesn’t, however, mean modifying a WordPress template and hosting it on a web server somewhere. Creating your own website from scratch provides you with the opportunity to familiarize yourself with different concepts, which will prove to be an invaluable experience later down the line.\nLevel 1\n                    Level 2\n                    Level 3\n                    Level 4\n                    Level 5\n                    Final challenge\n                \nA one-page website\n                    A contact form\n                    A blog\n                    A basic chatbot\n                    A login authenticator\n                    A 3D protfolio website\n                \n\nProject two: a game\nCreating a game will help you familiarize yourself with algorithms, common game code, inputs, and outputs. As you develop increasingly complicated games, you’ll also get a feel for data structures, events, and storing states. All while getting to play your favorite games… purely for testing purposes, right?\nLevel 1\n                    Level 2\n                    Level 3\n                    Level 4\n                    Level 5\n                    Final challenge\n                \nRock, paper, scissors game\n                    Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock\n                    Wordle game\n                    Connect four\n                    Battleships game\n                    Chess game\n                \n\nProject three: a useful app\nThe best thing about coding is you can solve your own problems – and if other people maybe have similar problems, then they might pay you for a solution, too.\nLevel 1\n                    Level 2\n                    Level 3\n                    Level 4\n                    Level 5\n                    Final challenge\n                \nTodo app\n                    Password generator\n                    Calculator\n                    Pomodoro timer\n                    Finance tracking app\n                    Kanban task management app\n                \n\nProject four: real-world websites and apps\nChances are you’re going to want to get a job – so you can make money with your new skill set. What better way to prepare for the job than by creating a website similar to the one you’ll be maintaining, so you can hit the floor running?\nLevel 1\n                    Level 2\n                    Level 3\n                    Level 4\n                    Level 5\n                    Final challenge\n                \nNews curation website\n                    Job webstire\n                    Twitter(X) app\n                    E-commerce site\n                    Video streaming app\n                    Social media platform\n                \n\n\nResources for learning JavaScript\nThere are thousands of resources available to teach you everything you need to know to become proficient with JavaScript. Unfortunately, we cannot cover them all. Nevertheless, below, we’ve prepared a list of some of our favorites, which we like mainly because they are some of the most complete and usually include some form of project-based practice. If you have any course recommendations of your own, please feel free to post them in the comments, along with your own review of what makes them so good.\nOnline platforms for learning JavaScript\nHyperskill – Paid\nThis hands-on platform offers over 300 real-world projects created by JetBrains Academy experts, allowing you to build your developer portfolio from scratch.

Focus.\nDon’t study passively: You need to be engaged, or it won’t stick.\nDon’t think you’ll learn it in one go: You won’t.\nConclusion\nThat’s it for today! Learning something new is an infinitely rewarding pursuit. With the right attitude and resources, there’s nothing you can’t learn – it just takes time. If you’re frustrated that you can’t create the next Amazon or Netflix competitor after taking a four-hour course, don’t worry – we’ve all been there. The only way to get better is to practice and code: try, fail, learn, and repeat. You’ll get the biggest gains by applying the code, so even once you have been through a course and learned the basics, it’s time to start applying this knowledge. This is where you’re going to get good – actually, not good – great! \nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TeamCity 2024.07 is out! With this release, we’re introducing a number of important features, such as a new licensing mechanism that simplifies the management of TeamCity server and agent licenses.\nThere’s also the new GitHub Checks webhook trigger that allows you to queue builds instantly after pushing a commit to GitHub and receive updates in rich text format.\nAdditionally, the new Problems page provides a unified place for reviewing any issues with TeamCity tests and builds.\nRead on to learn more about these features and other highlights of this release.\nNew licensing mechanism for JetBrains accounts\nIn version 2024.07, we’re introducing an option for TeamCity admins to activate licenses through a unified JetBrains Account. This new feature aims to simplify license management for TeamCity server and agent licenses through your JetBrains Account.\n\n\n\n\nPreviously, TeamCity Enterprise customers faced challenges with separate license keys for each build agent license or Enterprise server pack, especially for keys with different expiration dates. Offline keys require manual generation, download, and input into the TeamCity server. \nAdditionally, there was no flexibility to distribute agent licenses among multiple TeamCity servers, as customers had to manually transfer keys between servers. Furthermore, users couldn’t split agents from a single server pack between servers.\nNow, you can simply log into your JetBrains Account from the Licenses page in TeamCity and select a server license for activation. Once connected, TeamCity will automatically update all server and agent licenses, eliminating the need to manually enter license keys for additional agents or license renewals.\nTeamCity Professional users will also benefit from this new feature. Thanks to the unified JetBrains Account login, you’ll be able to stay better informed on all product updates and important security fixes.\nLearn more about the JetBrains Account login in our documentation.\nCustom path in the repository for versioned settings\nIn TeamCity, you can configure your projects and settings programmatically using the Kotlin DSL and XML format.\nPreviously, if a project had versioned settings stored in VCS, TeamCity would track only the .teamcity directory. TeamCity could still store versioned settings for all subprojects within a single repository, but only if the main project had versioned settings enabled. This was inconvenient in certain scenarios. For instance, a broken DSL in a main project blocked updates for all subprojects and other builds. \nAnother disadvantage of the previous approach is that if changes in one project triggered the Kotlin DSL compilation, the settings were applied to other projects stored in the same repository, even when the applied changes weren’t supposed to affect them.\nIn addition, users with large nested projects had to use different repositories to store versioned settings for different projects.\nWe’re now adding the ability to configure custom paths in the repository for versioned settings in TeamCity.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature is handy in the following scenarios:\nIf you have a monorepo with many projects and want to store settings for the subprojects, even if these subprojects aren’t interconnected.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have several projects stored in a single repository.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use your repository to exclusively store versioned settings, there is now an option to store them in the repository root, rather than a .teamcity subdirectory.\nRead more about this feature in our documentation. Feel free to leave your comments in the corresponding YouTrack issue.\nGitHub Checks webhook trigger\nThis new TeamCity feature allows you to queue builds instantly after pushing a commit to GitHub. It also publishes build statuses and details – such as problems or information about failed tests – in Markdown as GitHub checks.\n\n\n\n\nThis trigger is compatible with GitHub App connections that have webhooks enabled.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about this feature in our documentation.\nUploading SSH keys when creating project or VCS roots from URLs\nTeamCity allows you to create projects or VCS roots from a URL.\nPreviously, the form for creating a project or build configuration from a URL accepted credentials such as username and password/access token only. This limitation restricted project admins from using SSH fetch URLs for Git VCS roots configured in this manner.\nWe reworked the authentication form so that you can manually choose either the Password/Access token or the SSH key option as the authentication type.\nTeamCity will also automatically detect and suggest the appropriate authentication type when you insert the URL into the corresponding field.\nThe form’s new SSH key authentication supports passphrases, which are stored in the generated VCS root directory and used for this specific project or build configuration.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the ability to upload SSH keys in our documentation.\nPerforce Helix Core improvements\nCustomizing VCS label descriptions for Perforce (P4)\nThanks to its integration with Perforce Helix Core, TeamCity can build sources of projects stored in a Helix Core repository and apply automatic labels to sources and other elements.\nThanks to the VCS labeling build feature, TeamCity can label (tag) sources of a particular build in Perforce – both automatically and manually.\nIn version 2024.07, we’re adding the ability to customize VCS label descriptions, allowing you to be more specific in your descriptions. Similar to the existing labeling pattern settings, all TeamCity build parameters are available. \nFor instance, you can configure the VCS labeling build feature to display a TeamCity build or changelist number.\n\n\n\n\nHead over to our documentation to learn more about how to configure VCS label descriptions for Perforce and other VCSs.\nSupport for Perforce ditto mappings\nFor some time, Perforce Helix Server has had a one-to-many mapping feature, which allows users to map a single depot path to multiple locations in a client workspace. This feature is also known as ditto mapping. \nStarting from the 2024.07 version, ditto mapping is supported by TeamCity, too.\nRunning a custom task before checkout \nWe’re introducing a new feature called bootstrap steps that allows users to perform tasks before the checkout process runs on the agent. This helps identify and solve any locking issues, enables the working directory to be customized prior to checkout, and allows other actions to be performed on the agent before checkout. \nWhen this feature is enabled, the build step configuration screen contains a Run during bootstrap option, enabling these bootstrap steps to be executed before all other build steps and prior to checkout.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about bootstrap steps in our documentation.\nPrometheus counter for unassignable builds in queue\nIn certain scenarios, such as when TeamCity parameters are modified or the agent pool is depleted, jobs can stall indefinitely because they cannot be assigned to any agents.\nIn version 2024.07, we’re implementing the new build_queue_incompatible metric, which reflects the current number of builds without compatible agents in the build queue.\nSakura UI: Reworked Problems page\nTeamCity provides an overview of current problems and investigations at both the project and build levels. Users can manage build configuration errors, failed tests, muted problems, and ongoing investigations, as well as the assignee and status of each issue.\nWe reworked the UI to give our users a clearer overview of all issues and their statuses, which can now be found on the unified Problems page.\n\n\n\n\nThis new, sleek design provides users with a single spot from where they can review and act upon all existing build issues. \nFor the full list of new features, please see our release notes. \nAs always, feel free to reach out to us with any questions or suggestions via our forum or the contact form on our website. \nHappy building!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Incrementally modernizing our frontend infrastructure to roll out the latest React features without downgrades\n\nIntroduction\nAirbnb’s frontend recently reached a major milestone: all of our web surfaces have been upgraded from React 16 to React 18, the current major version of React¹. This was a big project for a product with many surfaces, including Guest and Host pages as well as many internal tools. To safely perform this upgrade, we created the React Upgrade System: reusable infrastructure that allows us to roll out new versions of React progressively across our monorepo and measure the results of the upgrade. In this blog post, we’ll discuss our upgrade philosophy, the system we created, and what we learned from performing this upgrade.\nWhile this post primarily focuses on React, the system and lessons are applicable to many web frameworks and libraries that require regular upgrades.\nChallenges of upgrading\nUpgrading dependencies is a common task in any long-lived project. Upgrades fix bugs, improve performance, and unlock new APIs. Some upgrades are simple, but upgrades become more difficult when large amounts of product code rely on changed APIs or subtle assumptions about behavior. In Airbnb’s web monorepo, we only allow one version of each top-level dependency (with some rare exceptions), with one package.json at the root of the repo. This ensures that code within the monorepo is internally compatible and consistent, and that we avoid shipping duplicate packages to users. Before the upgrade system, having a single version of each dependency meant performing an atomic update, which requires a huge amount of up-front migration work, a long-running upgrade branch, and a single milestone when it is finally deployed to users. Such an approach is error-prone and risky, thus requiring a “heroic” engineering effort to ship clean upgrades.\nIdeally, we’d be shipping small, incremental upgrades that have no issues. Without some way to test and progressively roll out this system to a large monorepo, we often needed to try upgrading multiple times, downgrading whenever any problems were found. Performance regressions were particularly difficult to catch using this upgrade strategy. Because there was no way to collect performance data prior to release, we went straight from 0% to 100% rollout on deployment.\nIdeal vs Reality graphs of our major and minor versions of React over time.\nOur goal with the React Upgrade System was to make more seamless upgrading less heroic and more routine. Specifically, our goals were to be able to:\n\nUpgrade incrementally so that we get feedback and learn lessons as soon as we can.\nUpgrade often so that the delta between our version and the upgraded version is as small as possible.\nTest upgrades so that we can precisely measure the performance impact of upgrades and make informed decisions about upgrade paths using this data.\n\nDesigning the React Upgrade System\nWorking backwards from these goals, we started to get an idea of what our ideal architecture would look like. We wanted to avoid a long-running upgrade branch so that we could upgrade incrementally, and we wanted to be able to A/B test the upgrade so that we would get feedback from production to inform shipping decisions.\nSimplified diagram of our ideal upgrade system\nThere were a couple of problems to solve with the most naive implementation of this system: we needed to pick a single version of React for rendering, and it was challenging to dynamically switch between the two versions at runtime. Here’s what the code would look like to render a basic application using this naive approach:\nimport React18 from 'react'; \nimport React16 from 'react'; // duplicated import?\nif (shouldEnableReact18()) {\n  const root = React18.createRoot(container);\n  root.render(<App />);\n} else {\n  React16.render(<App />, container);\n}\nThere are two issues with this:\n\nWe don’t want to bundle both versions of React in the application, or we’ll double our framework bundle size. Further, we might need to change the JSX transformation being used at build time, making our <App /> incompatible with one version or the other.\nIt’s not clear where the imports should come from. The ‘react’ dependency will point to either React 16 or React 18, but not to both.\n\nTo solve these problems, we used module aliasing to split the versions, and environment targeting to build and run the two split versions of React.\nModule aliasing\nWe addressed the problem of where these imports are coming from using module aliasing. Using yarn, we added another react dependency to our package.json, e.g.,\n\"react-18\": \"npm:react@18\"\nwhich allowed us to import React from the ‘react-18’ package. This got us part of the way there. Many tools (such as custom resolvers and build systems) need to know which of the two versions to use. To centralize the logic, we wired up all of our custom tooling into a central, “global alias” configuration. This global alias configuration allowed us to alias in one place for all of our different tools. Babel, Jest™, Webpack™, and other custom resolution logic all need to be aware of the conditions under which we want to redirect imports from ‘react’ to ‘react-18’. Aliasing the modules with our “global alias” configuration meant that user code did not need to change at all, and we were able to handle this redirect behind the scenes.\nTypeScript discrepancies\nGiven that any component could be run in React 16 or 18, we wanted to use the types for each component that work across both versions during our upgrade period. Thankfully, the React team has maintained backwards compatibility, even between major versions.\nWe installed the types for React 18, and for newly added APIs in React 18, we created a shim layer for these APIs that worked in both React 16 and 18 (for example, useTransition acted as a no-op in 16). For APIs with no possible shim (for example, useId), we indicated through type augmentation that this hook may be undefined at runtime.\nFor TypeScript-only breaking changes in React 18, we waited until the React 18 upgrade was complete before incrementally fixing these. We augmented the types to patch differences to allow progressively fixing these new Typescript errors in our monorepo.\nEnvironment targeting\nTo solve the problem of duplicated imports, we needed to produce two different build artifacts: one containing React 16 and one containing React 18. Let’s call these the “control” and “treatment” artifacts, respectively. Since Airbnb uses Server-Side Rendering (SSR), we also needed to run these two different artifacts in different node processes on the server. Using Kubernetes®, we set up two different Kubernetes environments that ran these control and treatment artifacts. Let’s call this setup environment targeting.\nModule aliasing and environment targeting in use together to deploy different versions of the framework together in production\nWe also wrote an environment variable (REACT_UPGRADE) to our assets at build time and set this variable at runtime in our node SSR service. This lets us perform conditional logic that might be necessarily on only one or the other side of our upgrade system.\nThis setup also worked for us in local development. Our “local” development environments were also deployed, so we were able to configure the React version for local development in the same way as production using this setup. As each SSR service was upgraded to React 18, we also switched the development environment for that service to React 18 to keep production and local development versions synchronized.\nTesting the upgrade\nAirbnb has a comprehensive test suite, which was helpful for building confidence in the safety of this upgrade before exposing the upgrade to users. Our test suite includes visual regression testing, integration testing, and unit testing. Before launching to users, we fixed all new failures in each of these suites.\nUnit tests were the hardest to abstract from framework internals. Because we use a combination of Enzyme and React Testing Library, we needed to fix assumptions about APIs and framework internals in unit tests, shims, and adapters. To achieve this, we ran all of our unit tests under both React 16 and 18, allowing existing failures in the React 18 test suite as we progressively fixed them. We used this “permitted failures” list to ratchet down the number of test failures over time, which prevented backsliding, as no new failures were allowed on the list. This approach allowed us to fix problems incrementally with components and our test environments.\nWe tracked the work of resolving hundreds of test failures with dashboards, merged fixes incrementally using the upgrade system, and split the work amongst a handful of developers. This made the migration work largely transparent to the broader frontend team and helped us gain confidence in the upgrade before rollout.\nProgressive rollout\nOnce we had module aliasing and environment targeting, we had the capability to author and deliver code for two different versions of React, all from the same codebase. To ensure safety and testability, we also needed a way of rolling out this new environment progressively. To reduce the amount of change happening at once, we wanted to control the roll out across traffic and product surfaces. Our experimentation infrastructure allowed us to direct traffic to each of our two production environments (control and treatment) at will. This setup also allowed us to test the upgrade internally first, and to completely turn off the upgrade if issues were found.\nControlling the rollout to different surfaces is more difficult. Within a Single Page App, managing multiple React versions would mean unmounting and mounting React roots. This would lead to poor performance and degrade the user experience.\nFor this reason, we managed the surface rollout upgrade at the app level. Airbnb’s monorepo houses many Single Page Apps, so it was useful to have the react upgrade system in place to be able to turn the upgrade on and off for each of these apps. Using our React Upgrade System, we were able to roll this out to a single app internally first, giving developers a way to opt-in and opt-out of the upgrade for testing, in both development and on our staging sites. This approach let us avoid having a long running feature branch, helping us achieve our goal of incremental upgrades.\nFeature adoption and future work\nUsing the system, we completely rolled out React 18 to all web surfaces at Airbnb, with no rollbacks required. After the upgrade, we were able to start testing new APIs such as new root APIs and concurrent rendering features. We intentionally held off for a few weeks on adopting these features until the upgrade had settled. This way we could be confident that we wouldn’t need to downgrade and have to revert code changes.\nIt’s been exciting to see performance improvements from adopting these new features, and we are continuing to experiment with expanding them to key UI surfaces that would benefit.\nTo ensure that our goal of upgrading is often met, we will use the React Upgrade System to test the canary channel of React. Instead of pointing to React 18, we can just point at the canary tag and get a preview of what migration work needs to be happening now for React 19. To make upgrading not require a heroic effort, staying current should be a continual effort spread out over time, rather than a large, one-off change.\nConclusion\nOur goals for the React Upgrade System were to enable us to upgrade incrementally, test upgrades, and upgrade often. Combining environment targeting and our aliasing system has allowed us to upgrade incrementally and test the upgrades. We’re beginning to run our frontend against React 19 beta, getting a head start on React 19.\nWe’d like to acknowledge the React team for putting effort into backwards compatibility between React versions, even major versions. Without that effort, this upgrade approach would not be possible.\nUsing the React Upgrade System, we gained confidence in our rollout of React 18, and will use this approach for future upgrades. We believe investing in an upgrading system is worthwhile, as upgrades will continue to be needed over time. The React Upgrade System has allowed us to test and roll out upgrades incrementally, ensuring that we’re delivering the best user experience and performance possible for our users.\nIf this kind of work sounds appealing to you, check out our open roles — we’re hiring!\nAcknowledgments\nMany thanks to Joshua Nelson for leading the effort to build the React Upgrade System as well as for drafting this blog post.\nAdditionally, thanks to Kim Nguyen, Callie Riggins Zetino, James Robinson, Dan Beam, Kaeson Ho, Rae Liu, Michael James, Noah Sugarman, Laurie Jin, Brie Bunge, Matt Mulder, Victor Lin for their assistance on this system and the pieces comprising it.\n[1]: React 17 was released in 2020 as a no-feature “stepping stone” release with minimal breaking changes.

Yes, even after 26 years using this fantastic tool, I am still discovering new features. So thanks to Gwyn for this!! This is all about deleting lines, and using the Windows Clipboard for support.\nYou can see the short video on our YouTube channel, and there is also a longer video with 20 must-know shortcuts here. Don’t forget to subscribe if you want to learn more tips!\n\nUsing the Clipboard History in Windows\nOne of my favorite tools on Windows is the Clipboard History. This feature was introduced in Windows 10 and is seriously adding productivity to my day-to-day. If you haven’t been using it, you need to enable it in the Windows settings. Simply follow the steps:\nGo to the Windows Settings\nSearch for Clipboard settings\nEnable “Clipboard History”\nWindows Clipboard settings\nTo test that this works, try the following:\nCopy one piece of text using Ctrl-C\nCopy another piece of text using Ctrl-C again.\nPress the Windows key and the V key together (Win-V)\nThis brings up a new window where you should be able to see the two entries you just copied at the top.\nThis enables you to copy multiple pieces of content in a document without having to always Ctrl-Tab back and forth between the original document and the target document. And the cool thing is that it even supports images!\nWindows Clipboard history with two items of text and one image\nDeleting a line with clipboard support\nSo why am I bringing this up? Well another thing that we do quite often in code is deleting lines. There’s even a joke that the best developers are not the one writing a lot of lines of code, but those who delete a lot of lines of code \nIn order to delete a whole line, most people would follow these steps:\nPlace the cursor on a line of code.\nMove the cursor to the top of the line with the Home key.\nIf the line was indented, press Home once again to ensure that the cursor is really on column 0.\nPress the Shift key.\nWith the Shift key pressed, move the cursor at the end of the line with the End key.\nWith the whole line selected, press the Delete button.\nProbably you will also have to press Delete once more to delete then empty line.\nThis is a lot of steps for a simple operation that we do a LOT in a developer’s day. Thankfully you can simplify it.\nPlace the cursor on a line of code.\nPress Ctrl-L.\nThat’s it. The line is deleted and there is no empty line remaining where it was. but the best part is, this line was saved in the Clipboard! To test this, simply press Win-V and you should see the line you just deleted on top of the history. Of course this also works for multiple lines.\nDeleting a line without clipboard support\nNow, sometimes you don’t want the deleted line(s) to be saved to the Clipboard history. In this case, follow these steps:\nPlace the cursor on a line of code.\nPress Ctrl-Shift-L.\nThis way you can keep your Clipboard history tidy.\nMore tips about Visual Studio\nHopefully these tips help you to be more productive! And if you want to learn more about key shortcuts in Visual Studio, you should watch Gwyn’s 5:30 minutes video on the Visual Studio YouTube channel.\nThe post Visual Studio tip: Using Ctrl-L to delete a line with and without Clipboard backup appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

ClipGrab (Win/Mac 지원 가능)\n유튜브나 vimeo같은 곳의 영상을 로컬에 저장해서 안정적으로 플레이 할 때 사용한다. Fedora에서는 간단하게 dnf로 설치한다.\n$ sudo dnf -y install clipgrab\n개인적으로 Clipgrab의 속도가 빨라서 종종 사용하는 편이다. 참고로 ClipGrab은 윈도10/윈도11, Mac도 지원한다. 설치는 검색해보면 공식 다운로드 링크를 볼 수 있을 것이다. (이상한 곳에서 다운로드 받으면 바이러스에 걸리므로 항상 오피셜 사이트인지 확인하고 받자. 이왕이면 좋은 프로그램을 만든 저작자에게 도네이션하면 좋을 듯 싶다.)\nClipGrab official site = http://clipgrab.de/en\nClipGrab\n\n\n \n3. video-downloader\n유튜브 영상/음성을 로컬에 저장해서 안정적으로 플레이 할 때 사용한다. Fedora에서는 간단하게 dnf로 설치한다.\n$ sudo dnf -y install video-downloader\n설치 후 실행은 Super키를 눌러 검색에서 video 혹은 비디오 정도만 쳐도 아이콘이 보이므로 실행하면 된다. 아니면 터미널에서 video-downloader를 쳐서 실행한다.\nvideo-downloader\n\n\nvideo-downloader의 사용법은 너무 간단하므로 그냥 실행해서 이것저것 해보면 될 것이다.\n \n4. playerctl\n외부에서 명령으로 음악, 영상 플레이어를 제어할 때 사용한다. 예를 들어 5초 뒤로 가게 하려면 아래와 같이 명령한다.\n$ playerctl position 5+\n이외에 다양한 기능이 있으므로 help를 참고하기 바란다.\n$ playerctl -h\nUsage:\n  playerctl [OPTION…] COMMAND - Controller for media players\n\n  For players supporting the MPRIS D-Bus specification\n\nHelp Options:\n  -h, --help                     Show help options\n\nApplication Options:\n  -p, --player=NAME              A comma separated list of names of players to control (default: the first available player)\n  -a, --all-players              Select all available players to be controlled\n  -i, --ignore-player=IGNORE     A comma separated list of names of players to ignore.\n  -f, --format                   A format string for printing properties and metadata\n  -F, --follow                   Block and append the query to output when it changes for the most recently updated player.\n  -l, --list-all                 List the names of running players that can be controlled\n  -s, --no-messages              Suppress diagnostic messages\n  -v, --version                  Print version information\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  play                    Command the player to play\n  pause                   Command the player to pause\n  play-pause              Command the player to toggle between play/pause\n  stop                    Command the player to stop\n  next                    Command the player to skip to the next track\n  previous                Command the player to skip to the previous track\n  position [OFFSET][+/-]  Command the player to go to the position or seek forward/backward OFFSET in seconds\n  volume [LEVEL][+/-]     Print or set the volume to LEVEL from 0.0 to 1.0\n  status                  Get the play status of the player\n  metadata [KEY...]       Print metadata information for the current track.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "1846~1935년을 배경으로 미국 중서부의 철도 회사들을 운영하는 주식+기차 보드게임.\n\n18XX는 1974년에 만들어진 Francis Tresham의 1829라는 게임에 기초해서 수많은 디자이너들이 이 게임의 룰을 도입한 수백종의 후속작을 만들면서 시리즈화 된 게임이다. \n18xx tree from Makecraftgame.com\n\n\n\n기본 18XX 시리즈 룰은 이렇다\n게임의 목표는 돈(현금 + 주식)을 많이 버는 것이다.\n플레이어인 나는 “주식 투자자“로 철도회사의 주식을 사고 판다.\n특정 회사의 주식을 가장 많이 가지고 있으면 나는 그 “회사의 사장“이 되어서 회사를 운영한다. 철로를 깔고 기차를 운영해서 돈을 번다. 그렇게 돈 번거는 내 것이 아닌 회사의 것이다. 즉, 내 돈과 회사의 돈은 철저히 분리되어 있다. (자연인과 법인이라고 보면 된다)\n회사가 돈을 벌어서 주주들에게 배당을 하면 주가가 올라가고, 자금을 모으기 위해 배당을 보류하면 주가가 떨어진다.\n회사는 자금을 모아서 기차를 사고, 운영해서 돈을 번다. 기차는 2개 도시만 움직이는 2기차 부터 여러개 도시를 통과하는 3,4,5,6,7,8 등부터 혹은 디젤 기차까지 업그레이드 된다. 2,3,4 등의 초기 기차는 특정 시점이 되면 노후화되어 폐기처분 된다.\n주주가 주식을 팔면 주가가 떨어진다. 사장인 나보다 주식 많은 사람이 생기면 회사 운영권이 넘어간다.\n은행에 돈이 떨어지면 그때 게임이 끝난다 (은행을 터뜨린다고 표현)\n가장 기본적인 룰이다. 즉 대부분의 보드게임은 내가 뭔가를 해서 나 혼자 돈을 버는데, 여기선 주식회사의 사장이 된다. 내가 버는 돈이 다 내꺼가 아니다. 배당을 통해서 다른 주주들도 돈을 벌게 해주니까 이기기 위해선 복잡한 계산이 필요하다. \n회사 자산을 다 팔아 치우고 깡통으로 만든 후 주식을 내다 팔아서, 회사를 2대 주주에게 넘기는 것도 가능하다. (폭탄 돌리기) 거기다 회사의 합병, 공매도, 운영하는 기차의 종류(화물,고속,지역..), 회사도 사기업부터 지역기반/다국적 회사들까지 다양해지면 정말 복잡한 주식게임이 된다.\n1846은 경제 전공자인 톰 레만이 룰을 수정해서 많이 현실적인 18시리즈.\n\n\n\n\n\n20% 짜리 사장 주식을 사면 바로 사장이 되면서 회사가 출범하고 운영이 가능. 사장이 지정하는 주가는 40-150 까지 설정이 가능. 초기 주가의 두배가 자본금으로 납입되는 것\n회사가 나머지 80% 주식을 가지고 시작하며, 누군가 현재 주가로 주식을 사가면 바로 자본금에 납입됨\n회사는 돈이 필요하면 현재 주가보다 한단계 낮은 금액으로 시장에 팔아서(신주 발행) 자금을 긴급 수혈 가능. 단 다시 사올 때는 한단계 높은 금액으로 사와야 함(자사주 매입)\n주식 라운드에서 주식 판매한다고 다 하락하는 건 아니고, 오직 사장이 주식을 팔때만 주가가 하락. 경영자가 주식을 파니까 이건 당연한 거지!\n주식 라운드가 끝났을 때 주식시장에 한주라도 남아있으면 주가 하락. 100% 모든 주식을 플레이어가 소유한 회사들은 주가가 상승. 시장에서 인기 있는 회사니까!\n회사의 총 수입을 배당, 반배당, 배당 보류 세가지로 운영 가능. 반배당하면 수익의 반은 회사가 가지고 나머지를 주주들한테 분배\n배당금액이 현재 주가대비 해서 2/3배 이상 크다면 주식이 2칸 또는 3칸 상승도 가능해서 수익이 많이 나는 회사은 주가가 폭발적으로 상승 가능\n사기업들도 특수 기능이 흥미롭게 되어있고, 경매가 아닌 독특한 드래프트 방식이어서 나름의 재미가 있음\n일리노이 센트럴 레일로드는 역사적으로 첫 토지 보조금을 받았던 철도회사여서, 그 사실이 게임내에 반영 되어있음. 출범할때 주식 한주 만큼을 은행에서 보조해주고, 특정 지역에 철도를 건설하는 비용을 $20에서 $0 으로 면제 해줌\n주식 라운드 1번에 운영 라운드 2번으로 고정\n실존했던 회사들인 New York Central Railroad(NYC), Pennsylvania Railroad(PRR), Illinois Central Railroad(IC), Baltimore & Ohio Railroad(B&O), Grant Trunk Railway(GT), Erie Railroad(ERIE), Chesapeake and Ohio Railway(C&O) 7개를 이용함. 회사 로고도 실제 그 회사들의 로고를 그대로 차용했음. 위키피디아에 찾아보면 그 회사들 정보를 다 검색 가능\n이날은 5명 풀로 시작해서, 10개의 모든 사기업과 7개 기업을 다 꺼내놓고 했음.\n드래프트인데도 다들 착하게? 2개씩 사기업을 선택해서 각자 2개씩 들고 시작.\n\n\n\n\n내 사기업으로 지도의 서쪽 끝지역인 세인트루이스/시카고에 고기 포장 회사 토큰($30)을 놓을수 있는 Meat Packing Company가 들어와서 나중에 일리노이 센트럴 레일로드(IC)를 운영. 후반부에 돈을 많이 벌려면 동/서를 연결하는 횡단 철도를 구성해야 하는데, C&O 와 NYC가 Columbus 도시를 선점하면서 횡단 철도가 차단되어 수익이 떡락 ㅠ\n결과적으로는 모든 도시에 $10 추가 수익을 가져다 주는 Mail Contract 사기업을 운영한 NYC 대표님이 엄청난 수익률을 자랑하며 1등으로 마무리\n\n\n\n\n오전 10시 30분에 설명 시작해서 1시간 설명하고, 중간에 점심/간식 시간 1시간을 제외하고 플레이만 총 7시간 30분 걸려서 저녁 8시에 끝났음\n아 너무 너무 재미나다. 매주 18시리즈만 한게임씩 돌리면 좋것다\n1846 #18xx #보드게임\nThe post 보드게임 리뷰 – 1846: 중서부로 달려라 first appeared on Guru's Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "노동자, 중산층, 자본가, 정부. 4인의 플레이어가 각 계층을 맡아서 저마다의 목표를 향해 플레이하는 보드게임. 부제목 “당신의 사회 계층을 승리로 이끄세요” 가 이해 될 만큼 굉장히 현실적인 요소들이 많이 반영되어서 해당 계층에 몰입해보는 효과도 있고, 계속 웃으면서 게임할 수 있음. \n\n문제는 4명 각각이 게임하는 방법이 조금씩 다르기 때문에 설명이 오래 걸린다는 것. 초플이라 2시간 설명하고 7시간 반동안 게임 했음. 물론 에러플 다수. 2차전 때는 각자 맡은 계층을 다시 하니 좀 빠르겠지 했는데 다들 고민이 많아지면서 8시간 반 게임을 해버림.\n노동자는 기업에서 일하며 임금을 받아 의료/교육/사치품 등으로 번영도를 올리는게 목표. 노조도 만들고 파업도 하고.\n자본가는 기업을 만들어서 식품/사치품 과 의료/교육 서비스를 생산. 물건을 다른 계층 및 해외에 수출해서 돈을 많이 버는게 목표.\n중산층은 취업해서 일을 하거나 소창업을 해서 돈도 벌고 물품도 생산하며 번영도와 돈 양쪽을 조화롭게 운영\n정부는 각 계층을 지원하여 지지도를 많이 얻으면 점수가 올라감. 정책에 관여해서 세금도 많이 벌고, 공기업도 운영.\n가장 중요한 것은 7가지의 정책. 재정/노동시장/과세/복지(교육 & 의료)/해외 무역/이민.\n\n\n\n\n 각 정책이 사회주의–신자유주의, 국수주의–세계통합주의 쪽으로 움직일때 마다 법인세,소득세,고용세,관세가 바뀌고, 이민자 및 공기업수도 조정됨. 이 정책 변경을 위해 법안을 발의하고 매 라운드 마다 투표가 일어남. 노동자/자본가/중산층은 각각 투표를 위해 자신들의 발언권 큐브를 주머니에 넣을 수 있음. \n매 라운드마다 투표단계에서 5개의 발언권 큐브를 뽑아서 정책 변경이 일어남. 보통은 매 라운드마다 인구수/기업수에 비례해서 큐브를 넣지만, 특정 카드를 활용해서 자신의 큐브를 더 넣어서 투표에서 더 유리해질 수도 있음. 투표와 별도로 영향력 큐브를 언론/방송 같은 기업을 통해 구매한 후 이걸로 투표 결과에 영향 미치는 것도 가능. 예를 들어 노동시장 정책에 따라 최저임금이 정해지고, 정책이 바뀌면 전체 기업들의 최저임금이 올라감.\n라운드 개요. 소득세, 고용세, 법인세 계산 방법\n\n\n\n정부는 투표는 불가능 하지만, 국영언론사 통해서 벌은 영향력 큐브를 캠페인 활동으로 가져와서 투표에 영향 미치는 것이 가능. 매 라운드 마다 정책 목표가 정해지고 그 정책과 일치하게 만들면 보너스가 주어지기 때문에 정책 부분을 계속 신경 써야함. 영향력이 많다면 돈이 부족할때 과세를 올려서 세금을 많이 받거나 하는 등의 작업도 가능함.\n\n\n\n\n정부는 매 턴마다 이슈가 발생하면 그걸 대응해서 각 계층의 지지도를 얻는 방식. 특정 계층이 소외받지 않게 지원해줘야 함. 마지막에 최하 지지도 2계층의 값을 받기 때문.\n각 계층에게는 40장의 행동카드가 주어지는데, 계층에 맞는 다양한 이슈들이 잘 구성되어 있음. 예를 들면 정부는 의료복지/사업보조금/취약계층지원/민영화/국영화 같은 액션 카드를 가지고 있음. 7장 받은뒤에 한장씩 내면서 5번의 행동을 하면 라운드 마무리. 총 5라운드동안 하니까 25개의 액션만으로 최고의 점수를 내야 함. 문제는 자신도 어떤 카드가 나올지 모르는데, 각 계층마다 약간 카운터 같은 카드가 나올 수 있기 때문에 잘하기가 어렵다는 것.\n정부는 민영화 카드로 자본가 계층에게 회사를 매각가능. 반대로 국영화도 있음 \n첫번째 플레이때는 4라운드 후반에 내가 맡은 “정부”가 대출금 한도를 넘어가면서 IMF가 발생. 모든 정책이 특정 칸으로 조정되어서 공기업 매각 및 최저임금이 최하 수준으로 변경됨. 그러면서 노동자 계층에 대량 실업자가 발생하자, 5라운드에 노동자 계층이 “시위”를 함. 시위가 발생하면 실업자를 해결하기 위해 기업을 더 만들어야 하는데, 누구도 돈이 없어서 기업을 못만드는 상황. 끝내 실업자를 고용하지 못한 중산층/자본가/정부 플레이어 모두 승점을 몇점씩 잃어버리는 광역기가 되어버렸음.\n하얀색은 의료 계층 종사자인데 편의점에서 일하고 있음\n\n\n\n너무 재미나서 2차전을 한번 더 하기로 함. 2주만에 모였더니 각자가 자기 룰도 기억 잘 안나서, 다른 계층은 꿈도 못 꾸고 예전과 같은 클래스 붙잡게 되어 나는 또 “정부” 담당. \n2차전에는 확장을 몇개 추가 \n”위기와 대처“ : 정부의 대출 초과로 IMF 발생시마다 상황을 바꿔줌\n”숨겨진 안건“ : 각 클래스별 히든 목표를 부여해서 추가 점수 획득 가능\n”역사적 사건들“ : 매 라운드마다 실제 있었던 사건이 하나 씩 열리면서 환경을 조금씩 바꿔 줌\n\n준비단계에서 ”미국 독립 혁명“ 카드가 나오면서 수출이 막혀버려서 자본가에게 불리한 판세가 구성. 게다가 1라운드 카드로 제 1차 세계대전이 발발하면서 자본가 계층이 가진 사치품 기업(쇼핑몰)을 국영화 시킴. 자본금의 2배를 자본가에게 주고 사야해서 이거 뭔가 했는데, 나중에 사치품 덕을 톡톡히 봄.\n기본적으로 정부는 의료,교육 서비스 밖에 생산이 안되는데 사치품을 생산할 수 있게 되면서 돈이 필요할때 마다 사치품을 해외에 수출 가능 해짐. 그래서 3라운드에서 정부에 돈이 떨어지면서 IMF로 가나 했는데, 사치품을 팔아 제끼면서 겨우 IMF를 막음. \n\n5라운드에 노동자 계층이 총파업을 단행. 원래 파업은 2개 기업밖에 안되는데, 노조 갯수 만큼 파업이 가능한 카드를 시전하면서 4개 노조의 힘으로 6개 기업이 파업에 돌입.\n공기업(대학병원, 국영방송국) 2개\n자본가 기업(종합대학, 기술대학) 2개\n중산층 기업(개인병원, 유기농 농장) 2개\n그러자 자본가 쪽에서 대학을 팔아 치워버리면서 대규모 실업자가 발생\n\n\n\n\n\n정작 마지막에 임금을 다 받지 못한 노동자 계층의 액션이 꼬이고, 중산층에서 정부의 의료서비스를 쓸데없이 사주는 오류플이 발생하면서 또 한번 나(정부)의 승리로 끝남.\n중산층 플레이어 : ”이 게임 밸붕이야!“\n자본가 플레이어 : ”잘하는 자본가에 맞춰서 밸런스를 잡은 거 아님?“\n노동자 플레이어 : ”한턴 꼬여서 망했어!“\n정말 즐거운 게임 “Hegemony – 헤게모니“\n이 게임 만든 친구들은 이런 테마에 재미들렸는지, 차기작으로 World Order 라는 게임을 준비중\n#보드게임 #헤게모니\nThe post 보드게임 리뷰: 헤게모니 – 당신의 사회 계층을 승리로 이끄세요 first appeared on Guru's Blog.",

AI 챗봇들은 이럴 때 주식을 더 사야 한다고 말할까, 이제 정리할 때라고 조언할까.",

= null\n}\n\n\n그리고 아래와 같이 저장한다.\n\n// Don't\n\nAndroidView(\n    factory = {\n        val parentLayout = FrameLayout(context).apply {\n            val web = KeepWebView.webView ?: WebView(context).apply {}.also {\n                KeepWebView.webView = it\n            }\n        }\n    }\n)\n\n\n이론적으론 싱글턴으로 사용하여 유지할 수 있다. 싱글 액티비티를 사용한다면 큰 문제는 없을 수도 있다.(onDestroy에서 clear는 해야 한다.)\n\nCompose에서 제공하는 방법을 활용해 보자.\nCompose에선 CompositionLocalProvider 사용해 범위를 지정하여 사용할 수 있는데, 이를 활용해 해결할 수 있다.\nCompositionLocalProvider 링크\nNavigation을 가진 뷰 상위에 CompositionLocalProvider 적용하여 WebView를 keep 할 수 있도록 구현하는 방법이다.\n이렇게 하면 최소한 WebView를 네비게이션 이동할 때마다 다시 생성하는 부분은 막아 줄 수 있다.\n\n적용 코드\nWebView 용 CompositionLocalProvider 아래와 같이 작성하였다.\n\ninternal object LocalWebOwner {\n\n    private val LocalComposition = staticCompositionLocalOf<WebView?> { null }\n\n    val current: WebView?\n        @Composable\n        get() = LocalComposition.current\n\n    infix fun provides(registerOwner: WebView?): ProvidedValue<WebView?> =\n        LocalComposition provides registerOwner\n}\n\n\n사용할 때는 아래와 같이 사용할 수 있도록 기존 remember 부분의 코드를 변경한다.\n\nval webView = LocalWebOwner.current\n\nAndroidView(\n    factory = {\n        val parentLayout = FrameLayout(context).apply {\n            val web = webView ?: WebView(context).apply {\n                this.layoutParams = layoutParams\n            }\n            addView(web)\n        }\n    }\n)\n\n\nwebView가 결국 null 일 수 있으니 초기화 코드는 동일하게 포함되어야 한다.\n이 코드를 그대로 적용하면\n\nThe specified child already has a parent. You must call removeView() on the child's parent first.\n\n\n그래서 기존 View가 release 동작시 remove를 시켜주어야 한다는 점이다.\n\nonRelease = { parentFrame ->\n    (parentFrame.children.first() as? WebView)?.let {\n        parentFrame.removeView(it)\n    }\n}\n\n\n마지막으로 Navigation을 감싸는 Screen 코드를 아래와 같이 수정해 주어야 한다.\n위치는 Activity일 수도 있다.\n\nval context = LocalContext.current\nCompositionLocalProvider(\n    LocalWebOwner provides WebView(context)\n) {\n    NavHost(){}\n}\n\n\n\n마무리\n이 방법은 WebView는 Navigation Scope 내부에서는 동일한 WebView를 사용하게 됨으로써 최소한 WebView 객체를 처음부터 다시 생성하는 부분은 막을 수 있지만 Web 자체의 리로드를 막는 코드는 아니다.\n그래도 WebView가 새로 생성되어 두 배 세배 더 느려지지 않는다면 만족스러운 결과를 볼 수 있을 것이다.\n결과적으론 아래와 같은데, 웹 자체는 reload가 호출됨을 알 수 있다.\nBefore\n\nAfter",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "무려 5년 가까이 AWS 에서 서비스를 하고 있었지만 부끄럽게도 이제야 AWS Solutions Architect Associate (이하 SAA)시험을 치렀다. SAA 시험의 내용이나 난이도, 합격 방법 같은 글은 무수히 많기도 하고, 공부 방법이 까다롭거나 한 시험도 아니기 때문에 나는 좀 다른 글을 써볼까 한다. 우물 안 개구리의 반성문이랄까?\n나는 왜 5년 동안 SAA test를 보지 않았는가? – Platform Lock-in 이라는 핑계\n내가 맡은 서비스는 대략 5년 가까이 AWS에서 운영중이다. 5년이면 AWS의 무수한 운영 노하우나 비용 최적화 방안, 아키텍처 설계에 대해 빠삭하게 알만도 한데, 부끄럽게도 1~2년 전 까지는 AWS를 그리 잘 알지 못했다.\nAWS를 잘 몰라도 되는 핑계는 여럿 있었다. 운영 부서가 따로 존재하기 때문에 직접 AWS 콘솔에 들어가 무언가를 할 일이 별로 없었기도 하고, k8s 클러스터를 EC2에 구성해 두었기 때문에 AWS를 잘 몰라도 서비스 운영이 가능했다.\n돌이켜볼 때, 가장 고약한 핑계는 “Platform Lock-in 을 경계하는 아키텍처”였다. AWS 특정 서비스에 Lock-in이 되어 버리면 나중에 다른 클라우드 제공자로 넘어가고 싶어도 넘어갈 수가 없다. Lambda 나 SQS 대신 클라우드 네이티브 스택 만으로 서비스를 구성해야 언제든 AWS를 버리고 Azure 나 GCP 로 사뿐히 넘어갈 수 있다. 플랫폼 중립적인 기술만으로 클라우드를 사용한다니 얼핏 생각해보면 꽤나 일리있는 말인 것 같다.\nAWS나 GCP 혹은 Azure 에 플랫폼 중립적으로 구성, 수 년째 운영중인 서비스가 있다고 가정해보자. 클라우드 락인 요소가 없는 서비스라고 해서 IDC나 혹은 다른 클라우드에 마이그레이션을 하는 작업이 정말로 간단한 일일까?\n아무리 플랫폼 중립적인 기술로 서비스를 구성하였더라도 운영중인 서비스, 더우기 수 년간 쌓인 데이터가 고이 보관된 서비스의 클라우드 제공자를 특별한 이유 없이 손바닥 뒤집듯 바꾸는 것은 굳이 해서는 안될 일에 가깝다. 잘되어야 본전이고 실수라도 하면 일어나지 않았을 장애를 유발하는, 리스크의 상방이 열려있는 행위를 굳이 시간과 비용을 들여 한다는건 그리 좋은 선택지가 아니다. 지나고 나서야 드는 생각이지만 “Platform Lock-in”을 핑계로 사용중인 클라우드만의 우수한 기능을 사용하지 않는다는건 바보같은 짓이다. 어차피 당신은 지금 쓰고 있는 클라우드를 떠날 수 없다.(정확히는 굳이 떠날 필요가 없다.)\neks와 karpenter를 도입하고 클라우드 비용 20% 절감한 건에 관하여\n위에서 잠깐 언급했지만 1년 전만 해도 우리 서비스는 eks 대신 EC2에 클러스터를 직접 구성하는 방식이었다. 어느 정도 규모 있는 회사라면 관리부서에서 직접 인프라를 관리하기 마련이기에, k8s 클러스터 관리도 인프라 부서에서 한다. 보통은 표준화된 방법으로 관리를 하다보니 말 그대로 AWS에서 EC2 VM만 가져다 쓴 셈이지 AWS 클라우드만의 솔루션이나 기능은 왠만해선 잘 쓰지 않았다.\n그러다 우연한 기회에 EC2에 구성한 클러스터를 eks로 전환할 일이 있었는데, 기왕 전환하는 김에 karpenter 도 함께 도입하였다. AWS에서 야심차게 내놓은 오픈소스 클러스터 오토스케일러가 어떤지 궁금하기도 했다.\n놀랍게도!! karpenter 도입 이후 클라우드 비용이 20%가 넘게 줄어들었다. 데이터 저장구조나 코드, 아키텍처를 최적화하지 않고도 이렇게 간단히 클라우드 비용을 낮출 수 있다니! 맛난 공짜점심을 먹으며 어렴풋이 이런 생각이 들었다. \n“내가 AWS를 너무 몰랐구나.”\n마음 한 켠이 내키지 않는 농심 라면 스펙 외우기 \n플랫폼 중립적인 기술만으로 서비스를 구성한다는 회사의 방침도 방침이지만, 얼마 전까지는 나 역시도 이런 플랫폼 중립적인 아키텍처에 동의하는 바였다. 특히 AWS 특유의 촌스러운 서비스 명칭을 별도로 시간내서 공부해야 한다는게 마음 한 켠이 내키지 않았다. 내가 왜 굳이 SageMaker 나 OpenSearch, SQS, CloudFormation 같은 고유명사를 외워가며 이 서비스의 역할이 무엇인지 알아야 하나. 이건 마치 슈퍼에 진열된 라면의 특징을 외우는 것과 다를 바 없지 않나. 나는 나만의 라면 제조사 브랜드 중립적인 라면 끓이기 레시피를 선호한다고.\n농심 사리곰탕면의 나트륨 함량은 16g 이고 우윳빛 사골국 맛이 난다던지, 콕콕 스파게티의 열량은 284kcal 이라 한 사발만으로 부족하니 1.5사발을 해야 한다던지 등의 지식을 외우는 사람은 없잖아?\n사실 이 글을 쓰는 이유는 혹시라도 AWS 서비스를 알아가는 것에 대해 나와 같은 이유로 거부감을 가지는 사람이 있다면 지금이라도 생각을 바꾸기 바라는 마음에서다. 수십 년 째 클라우드 서비스 제공자 업계 부동의 1위인 업체에서 만든 서비스의 기능과 목적, 활용 사례를 알아보는 것 만으로도 많은 공부가 된다. 교만했던 나는 이 사실을 SAA 를 준비하면서 알게 되었다.\n그러니까 S3 라던지 SQS, Lambda 같은 것들은 사리곰탕면 같은 고유명사가 아니라 대일밴드나 에스컬레이터처럼 보통명사화 된 제품들이라는거다.\n다음은 AWS 에서 발간한 백서 “AWS Well-Architected Framework”의 링크다. 무려 910 페이지나 되는 글이라 쉽지 않겠지만 클라우드 환경에서의 설계 원칙이 무엇인지, AWS는 어떤 요소들을 중요하게 생각하는지 알 수 있는 글이기에 클라우드를 사용하여 서비스를 개발하는 아키텍트거나, 아키텍트를 꿈꾸는 사람, 그리고 SAA를 준비하는 사람이라면 일독을 권한다. 꼼꼼히 정독한다기보단 AWS에서 중요하게 여기는 설계 원칙과 모범 사례가 무엇인지 훑는 정도로 참고하면 적당할 듯 하다.\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/ko_kr/wellarchitected/latest/framework/wellarchitected-framework.pdf#welcome\nChatGPT vs Claude – LLM과 함께 공부하는 SAA\nSAA를 준비한 기간은 대략 2주 정도이다. 아무래도 직장생활을 하면서 시험을 준비하다보니 많은 시간을 쏟기는 어렵다. 때문에 내가 선택한 공부 방법은 비용을 지불하면서라도 공부를 편하게 하는 것이었다. \nAWS Skill Builder 를 구독하면($29/월) 60문항 짜리 연습문제를 풀어볼 수 있는데, 이런 식으로 문제를 풀어봐야 SAA 시험이 어떤 식으로 출제되는지 감을 잡을 수 있다.\nExam Prep Enhanced Course: AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate(SAA-C03) 가 유료 강의이고 대부분의 내용이 유사하나 연습문제 갯수가 다르다(무료: 15문제 vs 유료: 60문제)\n실제 시험이 75문제(이중 15문제는 점수에 미포함, 실제론 60문제)이므로 60문제 짜리를 풀어봐야 시험에 가깝게 대비를 해볼 수가 있다.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n결정적으로 많은 도움을 받았던 도구는 ChatGPT와 Claude 였다. 처음에는 GPT로 학습을 하다 가끔씩 결정적인 오류를 자연스럽게 설명하는 만행(?)을 저지르는 바람에 Claude로 변경하였지만…\n내가 주로 활용했던 방식은 다음과 같다.\n문제를 풀다 모르는 서비스나 용어가 나오면 해당 단어에 대한 설명을 질의\n범용적인 기술 혹은 오픈소스 중에 유사한 기술이 있다면 비교\n실질적인 사용 사례\n문제를 풀 때 Kinesis Firehose 라는게 나왔는데 이 서비스가 어떤 것인지 사용을 해보지 않아서 설명만으로는 감이 잘 오지 않았다. 찾아보니 스트리밍 데이터에 대한 분석에 활용된다길래 Apache Spark 와 유사한 서비스인지 질문하였다.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n몇 번의 질의를 거치니 logstash와 같은 데이터 파이프라인 도구라는 것을 알 수 있었다. 특히 이런 시험문제의 요점 정리를 할 때는 매우 유용하다. – 사실 LLM 시대에 외워서 따는 자격증이 무슨 큰 의미가 있겠냐마는 어쨋든 공부에 도움이 되는건 맞다.\n특히 인프라 운영 부서가 나뉘어져 있는 회사에서는 보안이나 인증, 설정 관련한 솔루션 – WAF, Cognito 나 Config 등 – 은 써볼 기회가 잘 없을텐데, 이런 경우 해당 서비스에 대한 대략적인 개념을 파악할 때 도움이 된다.\nCloudFront + ECS + Lambda + Fargate + SQS + S3 = 가장 효율적인 아키텍처라는 가스라이팅\nSAA를 준비하다보면서 느낀 점을 말해보자면, 자꾸 AWS 솔루션이 클라우드 아키텍처에서 구성할 수 있는 최고로 효율적인 방안이라는 가스라이팅을 당하게 된다는거다. 이런 문제가 자꾸 나온다. \n‘다음 중 관리 코스트가 가장 낮은 아키텍처는?’\n‘다음 중 비용 효율적인 아키텍처는?’\n‘처리시간이 오래 소요되는 요청을 효과적으로 해결하는 아키텍처는?’\n이때 전가의 보도처럼 등장하는 솔루션이 Lambda + SQS + S3 이다. 문제에 따라 가끔 CloudFront, ECS와 Fargate 를 곁들이기도 한다. 이런 문제풀이를 계속하다보면 어느새 비동기 처리 문제 = Lambda + SQS 가 떠오른다. 비용 효율적인 Fargate나 빠른 응답성을 제공하는 CloudFront + S3 조합도 있다.\n사실 같은 AWS 솔루션을 쓰더라도 1가지 문제를 풀기 위한 다양한 방법이 존재한다. 이를테면 이 글의 서두에서 언급한 eks + Karpenter 를 사용하면 EC2를 쓰더라도 ECS 나 Fargate 보다 비용 효율적으로 동작시킬 수 있다. 하지만 이런 객관식 문제들은 모든 아키텍처 구성과 트레이드 오프를 다룰 수 없기에 어쩔 수 없이 특정 솔루션에 편향되어 있는 측면이 있다.\n비대면 시험의 주의점 – OnVue 는 iPhone의 연속성 카메라를 지원하지 않는다.\n만일 당신이 SAA를 비대면으로 치를 마음이 있고, 맥북과 보조 모니터 환경을 구성해 시험을 볼 예정이라면 당신은 매우 운이 좋은 사람이다. SAA 비대면 시험 솔루션인 OnVue 는 맥북 + 아이폰 연속성 카메라 구성을 제대로 지원하지 않는다. 별도의 웹캠을 구하던가 아니면 보조 모니터 대신 맥북 내장 모니터와 내장 웹캠을 써라.\n나는 OnVue 와 맥북-iPhone 의 연속성 카메라 호환성 문제로 첫번째 시험은 15분 쯤 경과한 시점에 더이상 진행을 하지 못하고 종료되었다. 시험을 치르기 전에 OnVue는 나의 시험 환경에 문제가 없는지 체크를 한다. 브라우저가 떠있다던가, 모니터가 2대 이상이라던가, 웹캠이나 마이크가 제대로 설치되지 않았다던가 하는 문제들을 차례로 검사하는데, 이때 아이폰 연속성 카메라에 대해서는 별다른 문제를 삼지 않는다. 다만 시험 시작 후 약 15분 쯤 경과하면 커서가 무지개로 변하고 아무 것도 할 수 없게 된다.\n몇 문제 풀어보지도 못하고 Fail할 뻔 했지만, 다행히 OnVue 측에서 다시 시험을 볼 수 있도록 조치해 주었다.\n\n\n\n\n\n요약\nSAA 시험 준비하는데 2주 걸림. 경력이 좀 된다면 2주면 충분하겠지만 주니어 직장인이라면 2주가 부족할 수도 있음.\nAWS Skill Builder 에서 $29/월 하는 구독을 해서 연습문제와 동영상 강의를 보는 것이 도움이 됨.\n덤프는 절반 이상이 오답임. 문제만 참고하고 스스로 풀어야 함.\nLLM 은 모르는 개념이나 용어, 서비스를 요약, 비교, 설명해주는 훌륭한 도구임.\n맥북 + 아이폰 연속성 카메라는 비대면 테스트와 호환되지 않음.",

        "contentSnippet": "엑셀 사용자를 위한 놀라운 팁 3가지! 업무 효율을 높이고 데이터 시각화를 개선하는 방법을 소개합니다.\n \n\n\n \n \n 엑셀은 많은 사람들이 일상적으로 사용하는 필수 도구 중 하나입니다. 그러나 이 강력한 프로그램에는 잘 알려지지 않은 유용한 기능들이 숨겨져 있습니다. 이 글에서는 여러분이 몰랐을 수도 있는 엑셀의 다섯 가지 빠른 팁을 소개합니다. 이 팁들은 데이터를 더 효과적으로 관리하고 시각화하는 데 큰 도움이 될 것입니다.\n \n1. 키보드 단축키로 배열 빠르게 선택하기\n엑셀에서 작업을 할 때, Ctrl+A 단축키는 매우 유용한 도구입니다. 많은 사람들이 이 단축키를 알고 있지만, 실제로 어떤 상황에서 어떻게 작동하는지에 대해 잘 모르는 경우가 많습니다. 이 단축키를 사용하면 특정 셀이나 데이터 범위를 빠르게 선택할 수 있어 작업 시간을 크게 줄일 수 있습니다.\n \n우선, 셀을 하나 선택한 후 Ctrl+A를 눌러보세요. 선택한 셀이 독립적인 셀이라면, 즉 다른 셀과 연결되지 않은 셀이라면, 전체 스프레드시트가 선택됩니다. 이는 전체 시트를 한 번에 복사하거나 서식을 적용할 때 매우 유용합니다. ▼\n\n\n \n \n 반면, 선택한 셀이 데이터 범위 내에 있거나 테이블의 일부라면, Ctrl+A를 눌렀을 때 해당 배열만 선택됩니다. 예를 들어, 데이터가 입력된 열이나 행이 있는 경우, 이 단축키를 사용하면 해당 데이터 범위만 선택되므로 특정 영역에만 서식을 적용하거나 데이터를 복사할 수 있습니다. ▼\n\n\n \n이러한 기능을 활용하면 마우스를 사용하여 일일이 데이터를 선택할 필요 없이, 키보드만으로도 빠르고 정확하게 데이터를 관리할 수 있습니다. 또한, Ctrl+A를 두 번 연속으로 누르면 처음에는 데이터 배열만 선택되지만, 다시 한 번 누르면 전체 시트가 선택됩니다. 이는 대규모 데이터 작업을 할 때 특히 유용합니다.\n \n이 단축키를 익히고 나면 엑셀에서의 작업 효율성이 눈에 띄게 향상될 것입니다. 반복적인 작업을 줄이고, 더 중요한 분석 작업에 집중할 수 있게 도와줍니다.\n \n \n2. 슬라이서를 추가하여 데이터 빠르게 필터링하기\n 엑셀에서 데이터를 테이블 형식으로 구성할 때, 기본적으로 각 열의 맨 위에 필터 버튼이 자동으로 나타납니다. 필터 버튼을 사용하면 특정 데이터를 검색하고 분석하는 데 유용하지만, 특정 열을 자주 필터링해야 하는 경우 슬라이서를 추가하는 것이 더 효율적입니다.\n \n슬라이서는 테이블의 특정 열에 대한 필터링 옵션을 제공하는 도구입니다. 시각적으로 직관적이어서 데이터 분석 작업을 보다 쉽고 빠르게 수행할 수 있게 도와줍니다. 예를 들어, 매출 데이터가 포함된 테이블에서 특정 매장이나 날짜 범위를 자주 필터링해야 한다면, 해당 열에 슬라이서를 추가하여 한눈에 필요한 데이터를 선택할 수 있습니다.\n \n슬라이서를 추가하는 방법은 간단합니다. 먼저, 테이블의 아무 셀이나 선택한 상태에서 리본 메뉴의 '표 디자인' 탭을 클릭합니다. 그런 다음 '슬라이서 삽입' 버튼을 클릭하면 슬라이서를 추가할 수 있는 창이 나타납니다. 여기서 슬라이서를 추가할 열을 선택하고 '확인'을 클릭하면 슬라이서가 테이블에 추가됩니다. ▼\n\n\n \n추가된 슬라이서는 마우스로 크기를 조정하거나 위치를 변경할 수 있으며, 슬라이서 탭을 통해 다양한 설정을 조정할 수 있습니다. ▼\n\n\n \n \n슬라이서의 제목을 제거하거나, 필터링 옵션을 세부적으로 설정할 수도 있습니다. 또한, Ctrl 키를 눌러 여러 항목을 동시에 선택하거나, Alt+C를 눌러 선택된 항목을 모두 지울 수 있어 매우 유용합니다.\n \n이렇게 슬라이서를 활용하면 데이터 필터링 작업이 훨씬 간편해지며, 분석 작업의 효율성이 크게 향상됩니다. 특히, 대규모 데이터를 다룰 때 여러 열을 동시에 필터링해야 하는 경우 슬라이서의 가치는 더욱 두드러집니다.\n \n \n3. 스파크라인을 사용하여 트렌드 시각화하기\n 엑셀에서 데이터를 시각화하는 방법 중 가장 간단하고 효과적인 방법 중 하나는 스파크라인을 사용하는 것입니다. 스파크라인은 셀 내부에 삽입되는 작은 차트로, 데이터의 트렌드를 한눈에 파악할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 일반적인 차트와 달리, 스파크라인은 공간을 많이 차지하지 않으면서도 중요한 정보를 시각적으로 전달할 수 있습니다.\n \n 스파크라인에는 세 가지 주요 유형이 있습니다. 첫 번째는 '선 스파크라인'으로, 데이터의 연속적인 변화를 선 그래프로 표현합니다. 두 번째는 '열 스파크라인'으로, 각 데이터 포인트를 작은 막대 그래프로 나타내어 비교하기 쉽게 합니다. 세 번째는 '이익/손실 스파크라인'으로, 양수와 음수를 강조하여 수익과 손실을 명확히 구분할 수 있게 해줍니다.\n \n 스파크라인을 추가하려면 먼저 데이터를 시각화할 셀 범위를 선택합니다. 그런 다음 리본 메뉴의 '삽입' 탭에서 '스파크라인' 그룹을 찾아 '선', '열', 또는 '승패' 중 하나를 선택합니다. 스파크라인을 삽입할 위치와 데이터를 선택한 후 '확인'을 클릭하면, 선택한 셀에 스파크라인이 추가됩니다. ▼\n\n\n\n\n스파크라인을 사용하면 시트의 다른 데이터와 함께 시각적으로 중요한 트렌드를 쉽게 확인할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 주간 매출 데이터를 분석할 때, 각 매장의 매출 변화를 스파크라인으로 표시하면 어느 매장이 상승세에 있는지, 어떤 매장이 하락세에 있는지를 한눈에 파악할 수 있습니다.\n \n또한, 스파크라인의 크기나 색상을 조정하여 가독성을 높일 수 있습니다. 셀의 크기를 조정하면 스파크라인도 자동으로 크기가 조정되며, 다양한 색상 옵션을 사용하여 데이터의 의미를 강조할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 하면 스프레드시트가 더 깔끔하고 전문적으로 보이게 됩니다.\n \n스파크라인은 데이터 분석과 보고서 작성 시 매우 유용한 도구입니다. 복잡한 차트를 사용하지 않고도 간단하게 데이터를 시각화할 수 있어, 빠른 의사결정에 도움을 줄 수 있습니다.\n \n엑셀의 숨겨진 기능들을 활용하면 데이터를 더 효율적으로 관리하고 시각화할 수 있습니다. \n이번에 소개한 3가지 팁을 실무에 적용해 보세요. 엑셀 사용 능력을 한 단계 업그레이드할 수 있을 것입니다.",

'inactive_border_color' 항목에서 비활성 창의 테두리 색상을 지정합니다. 파란색으로 설정하려면 'inactive_border_color: \"#0000FF\"'로 입력합니다.\n\n\n\n특정 앱에 대한 별도 설정 \n특정 앱의 테두리 색상을 별도로 설정하고 싶은 경우, 설정 파일에 다음과 같은 규칙을 추가하면 됩니다.\n```yaml\n- match: \"Title\"\n  contains: \"Google Chrome\"\n  active_border_color: \"#00FF00\"\n  inactive_border_color: \"#008000\"\n```\n 이렇게 하면 Google Chrome 창의 테두리 색상이 활성 상태에서는 녹색, 비활성 상태에서는 진한 녹색으로 표시됩니다. \n \n \n색상 코드 설정 팁 \n테두리 색상은 6자리 색상 코드로 지정해야 합니다. 정확한 색상 코드를 찾기 위해 'Just Color Picker'와 같은 컬러 피커 도구를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 원하는 색상의 코드를 쉽게 확인하고 설정 파일에 적용할 수 있습니다.\n\n설정 변경 적용 \n설정을 변경한 후에는 시스템 트레이 아이콘을 오른쪽 클릭하고 'Reload config'를 선택하여 변경 내용을 적용합니다. 또한, 'Install'을 선택하면 cute-borders가 Windows 시작 시 자동으로 실행되도록 설정할 수 있습니다.\n \n⬇️ 프로그램 다운로드\n \n\n \nGitHub - keifufu/cute-borders: Customize window border colors :3\nCustomize window border colors :3.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "2012년도에 스트롱을 시작했으니까, 이제 12년 동안 한국이라는 시장과 컨셉에 투자한 셈이다. 정말, 시간은 남이 뭘 하든지 상관없이 알아서 빨리 가는 것 같다. 그동안의 우리 성적표를 보면 나쁘지 않다. 나쁘지 않지만, 그렇다고 우리가 한국에서 가장 투자를 잘하는 VC는 아니다. 우리보다 더 수익률이 좋은 투자자도 많고, 우리보다 더 많은 유니콘 회사에 투자한 투자자도 많고, 우리보다 더 투자를 잘하는 투자자도 많다.\n그런데 그나마 다른 투자자들보다 스트롱이 제일 잘 한다고 생각하는 걸 딱 하나만 뽑자면, 아마도 한국에 투자하는 VC 중, 우리가 가장 많은 창업가와 회사를 검토한다는 점일 것 같다. 작년 한 해 동안 우리가 검토한 회사가 1,300개 정도였고, 해마다 우리 투자팀의 5명은 – 나 포함 – 1,000개 이상의 회사를 서류나 대면 미팅을 통해서 검토한다. 우린 워낙 초기 회사에 투자하기 때문에, 일단 많이 검토하고, 많이 만나고, 많이 이야기해야지만 우리가 창업가에게 찾는 다양한 정성적, 비정형적 자질들을 파악할 수 있다. 창업가들과의 만남을 최소화하고, 정량적인 데이터를 기반으로 투자하는 VC들도 있지만, 우리 모델은 이렇게 하는 것보다 무조건 발로 많이 뛰면서 최대한 많은 회사를 검토하고 만나야지 잘 작동한다는 걸 그동안의 경험으로 배우면서 느끼고 있다.\n그동안 이렇게 많은 회사와 미팅하면서 내가 느끼고 배운 점들이 상당히 많다. 물론, 어떤 미팅은 아주 좋고, 어떤 미팅은 별로이고, 어떤 미팅은 실제 투자로 이어지지만, 대부분의 미팅은 투자로 이어지지 않는다. 하지만, 지금까지 창업가들과의 만남 중 쓸모없는 미팅은 단 한 개도 없었다. 별로였던 미팅조차도, 다시는 이런 스타일의 창업가와는 미팅하면 안 되겠다는 배움을 얻을 수 있는 쓸모 있는 미팅이다.\n사람을 만날 때마다 뭔가를 배울 수 있다는 관점에서 보면, 그리고 배움은 좋다는 관점에서 보면, VC만큼 보람차고 배움을 많이 얻을 수 있는 직업은 없다고 생각한다. 특히 우리같이 가리지 않고 모든 분야에 투자하면, 정말 생각지도 못한 아이디어, 기발한 사업 모델, 그리고 뭐니 뭐니 해도 정말 독특하고 특이한 창업가들을 많이 만난다. 로켓 만드는 회사에서 햄버거 프랜차이즈 회사까지, 1년 내내 재미있고 신기한 사업을 하는 창업가들을 만날 수 있다. 나만 원한다면, 그리고 시간을 할애할 수만 있다면, 내가 만날 수 있는 창업가들은 무제한이고, 이들로부터 뭔가를 배울 기회는 무궁무진하다. 그리고 정말 좋은 점은, 내가 찾아가도 되지만, 많은 분들이 우리 사무실로 기꺼이 와서, 본인들이 지금까지 사업하면서 많게는 10년 넘게 배웠던 살아 있는 지식을 가감 없이 우리와 공유해 준다는 것이다. 끊임없는 배움을 가로막는 유일한 한계는 바로 내겐 하루에 24시간 밖에 없고, 창업가들을 만나는 것 외에 다른 할 일들이 있다는 점이다.\n결국 VC를 한다는 건 끝없이 듣고, 끝없이 생각하고, 끝없이 질문하는 건데, 이건 학교에서 공부하는 거랑 별반 다르지 않다. 아니, 학교에서보다 훨씬 더 가치 있는 교육을 받을 수 있다. 모든 게 죽은 지식이 아니라, 생생하게 살아있고, 인생에 큰 도움이 되는 지식과 경험이기 때문이다. 나는 내가 VC라는 직업에 종사하면서 세상에서 가장 큰 학교에 다니는 학생이라는 생각을 종종 한다. 원래는 비싼 등록금을 내면서 지식을 습득해야 하는데, 오히려 월급을 받으면서, 아주 편하게 우리 사무실에서 앉아서, 나보다 더 훨씬 더 똑똑하고 경험이 많은 선생님인 창업가들이, 본인들이 피똥 싸고 개고생하면서 습득한 지식을 전부 다 공유하는데, 이게 얼마나 좋은 직업인가?\n이런 맥락에서 투자를 접근하다보면, 우리가 제공하는 초기 자본이 회사의 지분을 취득하기 위한 투자금이라기보단, 아주 똑똑한 분들이 사업 하는 걸 가까이서 보고 많은 걸 배우기 위해서 내는 수업료나 등록금이라는 생각도 든다. 다만, 우리가 창업가분들로부터 이렇게 많은 걸 배우는데, 창업가분들도 우리에게 조금이라도 뭔가를 배울 수 있길 바란다.",

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. Vertical Engineering 팀의 이지민입니다.\n지마켓의 여행 플랫폼은 작년에 포스팅한 오픈마켓에서 여행 플랫폼으로 살아남기에서 소개드린 바 있습니다.\n여행 플랫폼은 지마켓의 커머스 시스템과 OTA(온라인 여행사 제휴업체) 서버의 API를 통합하여 서비스를 제공합니다. 이처럼 여러 서버와 의존성이 높아, 서비스의 복잡도가 높습니다.\n \n특히, 실시간 API 연동을 요구하여, 견고하게 API를 호출해야 하는 비즈니스 도메인은 다음과 같습니다.\n여행 상품 상세 페이지\n실시간 예약\n이번 글에서는 여행 상품 상세 페이지와 실시간 예약의 주요 특징과 고려 사항에 대해 설명하고자 합니다.\n(1) 여행 상품 상세 페이지\n여행 상품 상세 페이지는 내결함성(fault tolerance)이 높아야 하는 화면입니다. 이러한 요건이 생긴 배경과 개발 고려 사항은 다음과 같습니다.\n특징\n여행 상품 상세 페이지는 지마켓 여행 플랫폼, 지마켓 커머스 시스템, OTA (온라인 여행사 제휴업체) 서버의 API를 조합하여 기능을 제공합니다. 한 화면에서 사용하는 API의 수만 10개 이상이고, 이를 책임지는 팀과 회사도 다양합니다.\n다음은 상품 상세 페이지를 구성하기 위해 관여하는 서버를 추상화한 그림입니다.\n\n\n\n\n여행플랫폼의 API에서 문제가 발생할 경우, 여행팀 내부에서 신속하게 대응할 수 있습니다. 반면, 외부에서 제공받은 API는 직접 제어하기 어렵습니다.\n \n특히 일부 OTA (온라인 여행사 제휴업체)는 타사의 API를 직접 연동하기도 합니다. 이 경우, API 문제 발생 시, 대응이 더 어렵습니다.\n하나의 상품 상세 페이지를 완성하는 과정은 여러 팀과 회사의 서버가 협력하는 복잡한 작업입니다. 그래서 다수의 API가 항상 완벽하게 동작하기를 기대하기 어렵습니다.\n \n이러한 특징으로 여행 상품 상세 페이지는 내결함성(fault tolerance)이 높은 시스템을 만들어야 한다는 미션이 있습니다.\n \nfault tolerance: 시스템을 구성하는 부품의 일부에서 결함(fault) 또는 고장(failure)이 발생하여도 정상적 혹은 부분적으로 기능을 수행할 수 있는 시스템\n \nAPI 연동 고려 사항\n(a) 타임아웃 시간을 case by case으로 설정하기\n일부 API의 응답 지연이 여행 상품 상세 페이지에 영향을 미치지 않게 하려면, 타임아웃을 적절하게 설정해야 합니다.\n이때, 두 가지 특징을 고려하여, API 별로 적절한 타\n임아웃을 설정해야 합니다.\n중요도\n평균 응답시간\n중요도가 낮은 API는타임아웃을 적절하게 설정하여, 응답 지연이 전체로 전파되지 않도록 해야 합니다.\n반면, 응답시간이 오래 걸리더라도 중요도가 높은 API은 최대한 기다려야 합니다. 대표적인 예로 가격과 재고 조회 API가 있습니다.\n \n여행 도메인에서 모든 실가격과 재고를 데이터베이스에 적재하는 것은 어렵습니다. 가격과 재고는 “상품 x 옵션 x 연령별 요금제 x 날짜 x 시간” 등등의 조합을 통해 결정됩니다.\n \n모든 조합을 사전에 저장해두는 것은 많은 비용이 들기 때문에 실시간으로 조회하여 연산해야 합니다. 이 경우, 오랜 시간 기다려야 합니다.\n(b) fallback: 결함이 발생하지 않은 척하기\n특정 API에서 오류가 발생하는 경우, 일시적으로 기능을 제공하지 않는 방법으로 내결함성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어, 할인된 가격을 다루는 API에서 이슈가 발생하는 경우, 원가를 노출하는 경우가 있습니다.\n\n\nreslience4j을 사용하면 api 에러에 대한 fallback처리를 손쉽게 할 수 있습니다.\n다음은 CircuitBreaker에 fallbackMethod를 적용한 샘플코드입니다.\n@CircuitBreaker(name = \"discount\", fallbackMethod = \"getDiscountPriceFallback\")\npublic DiscountPrice getDiscountPrice(String productId, BigDecimal originPrice)\n    ...\n}\n\npublic DiscountPrice getDiscountPriceFallback(String productId, BigDecimal originPrice, Throwable t) {\n    return DiscountPrice.builder()\n    .price(originPrice)\n    .build();\n}\n(2) 실시간 예약\n실시간 예약 처리는 최종 일관성과 멱등성을 보장해야 합니다. 이러한 요건이 생긴 배경과 개발 고려 사항은 다음과 같습니다.\n특징\n고객의 결제가 승인되면, 예약을 확정하는 “실시간 예약”이 이루어집니다. “실시간 예약”은 지마켓 예약 플랫폼, 커머스 시스템, OTA (온라인 여행사 제휴업체)가 실예약을 계약하는 과정입니다.\n이 과정이 중요한 이유는 크게 2가지입니다.\n금전 거래와 관련 있다.\n\n고객은 비용을 지불하고, 판매자는 대금에 대한 정산을 받는다.\n실시간 예약이 완료되는 시점부터 취소 위약금이 부과될 수 있다.\n고객이 예약한 서비스를 확실하게 보장해야 한다.\n\n만약 연동이 원활하지 않으면, 고객은 여행지에서 예약한 서비스를 제대로 제공받지 못하게 된다.\n각 시스템은 자신만의 고유한 상태를 지닙니다. 그리고 각 상태는 결제, 대금정산, 여행 서비스 제공 등의 기반 데이터로 사용됩니다. 그래서 세 개의 시스템은 일관된 상태로 동기화되어야 합니다.\n\n\n이러한 특징에 의하여, 두 가지 비기능요건이 요구됩니다.\n최종일관성 (eventual consistency)\n\n일시적으로 상태가 어긋나더라도, 결국 동일한 단계의 상태로 동기화가 되어야 한다.\n멱등성\n\n동일한 연산을 여러 번 수행해도 결과가 동일해야 한다.\n \nAPI 연동 고려 사항\n(a) 상태머신 (state machine) 만들기\n상태머신을 만들면, 복잡한 상태 연동 과정이 단순해집니다. 그리고 상태 동기화 함수의 재사용성도 높아집니다.\n상태머신을 설계할 때에는 다음 두 가지가 사전에 정의되어야 합니다.\n각 시스템 별 상태 정의하기\n시스템 간 동일한 단계 매칭하기\n다음 그림은 여행 플랫폼, 지마켓 커머스 시스템, 제휴사 시스템의 각 예약과 주문 상태에 대해 정의한 상태 다이어그램입니다. \n\n\n여행플랫폼에서는 이처럼 상태의 흐름과 규칙을 사전에 정의한 후, 상태를 전이시키는 상태머신을 구현하였습니다. \n \n(b) 대사배치 만들기\n일시적인 장애로 인하여, 상태 연동 처리에 실패하는 경우가 있습니다.\n이때, 각 시스템의 예약 상태를 확인하고 재연동하는 대사 작업을 통해 이를 보강할 수 있습니다.\n \n오케스트레이터 역할을 하는 배치 프로그램이 각 시스템의 상태를 확인합니다.\n그리고 상태가 어긋난 경우, 상태머신을 통해 상태를 재연동합니다.\n\n\n이를 통해 상태가 일시적으로 어긋나더라도, 결국 일치하게 되는 최종일관성을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n \n(c) 멱등성을 고려하여, 재시도하기\n예약 상태 연동 과정에서 API 호출 에러가 발생하는 경우, 재시도로 문제를 해결할 수 있습니다. 그러나 예약 플랫폼에서는 에러응답을 받았으나, 연계 시스템에서는 정상적으로 접수된 상태일 수도 있습니다.\n \n예를 들어, 타임아웃 및 네트워크 오류에 의하여 클라이언트는 에러가 났지만, 서버의 트랜잭션은 정상 종료가 된 경우가 그러합니다. 이 경우, API 호출을 재시도하면 연계 시스템 입장에서는 중복 요청이 됩니다.\n \n중복 요청 시, 연계시스템에서 에러를 리턴하는 경우가 있습니다. 이때 예약 플랫폼은 요청이 정상으로 접수된 것으로 인지할 수 있게 예외처리를 해야 합니다.\n \n(c-2) 중복 요청 시, 명시적인 에러코드가 반환되는 경우\n\n\n중복 요청 에러 코드가 내려오는 경우는 해피한 케이스입니다.\n해당 에러 코드가 내려오면 예약 플랫폼은 이를 성공으로 간주합니다.\n \n(c-2) 명시적인 에러코드는 없지만, 상태 조회 API를 제공하는 경우\n\n\n때로는 중복요청으로 에러가 발생하더라도, 에러코드로 이를 식별할 수 없는 경우가 있습니다. 이 경우, 연계 시스템의 상태 조회 API를 활용하여 중복 호출 가능 여부를 판단할 수 있습니다.\n \n때로는 연계 시스템의 상태가 다음 상태로 전이될 때까지 기다려야 하는 경우도 있습니다.\n이때에는spring-retry의 exception, backoff 옵션을 사용하여, 일정시간 대기 이후 재시도를 할 수 있습니다.\n@Override\n@Retryable(value = NotReadyReservationException.class, backoff = @Backoff(delay = 5000), maxAttempts = 3)\npublic void reserve(String id) {\n    if(!isReservationReady(id)){\n        throw new NotReadyReservationException(id);\n    }\n    ...    \n}\n \n(c) 보상 트랜잭션: 재시도로 해결할 수 없다면 깔끔하게 놓아주자.\n재시도로 해결할 수 없는 문제도 있습니다.\n중복 호출 횟수만큼 실 데이터가 중복으로 접수되는 경우\n배치에서 일정 기간 동안 재시도를 했음에도 해결되지 않는 경우\n이 경우, 보상 트랜잭션을 통해 데이터를 원상태로 돌려주어야 합니다.\n\n\n보상 트랜잭션을 매끄럽게 처리하려면, 롤백을 하기 쉬운 순서대로 외부 시스템을 연동해야 합니다. 제어하기 어렵고, 금전 거래와 관련된 트랜잭션은 가장 나중에 호출하는 것이 좋습니다.\n \n예를 들어, OTA (온라인 여행 제휴업체)와 실예약을 계약하는 시점부터 취소가 불가능하거나 취소위약금이 부과되는 경우가 있습니다.\n\n\n만약 OTA (온라인 여행 제휴업체)와 실예약을 한 이후, 지마켓 내부 시스템 연동에 실패한다면 상황을 되돌리기 어렵습니다.\n \n\n\n\n\n그래서 이 경우, 상대적으로 대응이 쉬운 시스템을 먼저 연동하는 것이 좋습니다.\n그리고 돌이킬 수 없는 요청은 최하단에 배치하는 것이 좋습니다. \n\n\n \n마치며\n본 글을 통해 여러 시스템과 API를 연동하며, 고려했던 점들을 공유드렸습니다. 본 글이 API 연동 과정에서 어려움을 겪는 분들께 도움이 되었으면 합니다.\n \n참고\n[도서] 이벤트 기반

        "content:encodedSnippet": "‘프로그래머의 길, 멘토에게 묻다’ 라는 책을 몇달전에 읽었다. 책의 내용이 좋아 그냥 머릿속에서 휘발시켜버리기에는 아까워 블로그에 (내가 생각하는) 핵심 내용을 간단히 요약 정리해보고자 한다. 앞으로는 읽었던 책 중에서 블로그에 올릴만한 좋은 책들은 비슷하게 정리해서 올려볼까 한다.\n이 책의 원제는 ‘Apprenticeship Patterns : Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman (견습생 패턴: 소프트웨어 장인을 꿈꾸는 이들을 위한 지침)’ 이다. 원제를 보면 알 수 있듯이, 이 책은 소프트웨어 장인정신에 대해 이야기하는 책이다. 프로그래머로서의 커리어를 걷는 이들이 마주하게 되는 상황, 문제, 해결방법을 마치 소프트웨어 패턴과 같이 정리해둔 책이다.\n개인적으로 좋다고 생각하는 파트에는 제목에 * 을 붙여두었다.\n\n1. 들어가는 글\n\n소프트웨어 장인정신이란 무엇인가?\n‘당신은 더 나아질 수 있으며 당신이 제대로 할 준비가 되어 있다면 모든 것은 개선될 수 있다’는 믿음\n“당신을 영리하고 재능있게 만드는 것은 노력이며, 실패란 단지 다음번에 다른 방법을 시도해 볼 수 있도록 하는 보상이다.”\n이러한 생각은 우리가 정해진 만큼의 재능을 가지고 태어났고, 실패란 재능이 부족하다는 표시라는 통념과는 정 반대이다.\n피드백을 바탕으로 항상 적응하고 변화해 갈 필요성. “자신의 행위에서 적합하지 못한 면을 깨닫고 그 해결책을 찾으려는” 자발성\n독단적이기보다는 실용적이려는 욕구. 일을 잘 하기 위해서 이론적인 순수함이나 앞날의 완벽함을 준비하는 것을 양보하는 태도\n지식을 쌓아두기만 하여 희소하게 만들기 보다는, 서로 나누는 편이 더 낫다는 신념\n자신이 틀렸다고 증명될지라도 기꺼이 실험하는 자세. 우리는 흔히 실패하지만, 얻은 교훈을 다음 실험에 활용할 수 있다.\n‘내적 통제위치’에 대한 헌신. 스스로 운명을 지배하고 책임지고자 하는 태도를 갖는 것\n프로세스 중심적이기 보다, 역량 중심적\n\n견습생이 된다는 것\n내가 지금 하고 있는 일을 항상 좀 더 좋고 세련되고 빠르게 해결하는 방법이 있을거라고 생각하는 태도\n발전해 가면서 더 나은 방법을 찾아 가는, 그리고 더 좋고 세련되고 빠른 방법을 배우도록 만드는 사람, 회사 혹은 상황을 찾는 상태이자 과정\n해답을 건네줄 누군가에게 의존하지 않으며 문제를 해결하는 건설적인 방법을 찾도록 하는 내적 추진력을 갖는다는 것은 커다란 가치가 있다.\n\n2. 잔을 비우다\n\n첫 번째 언어\n언어를 배우는 과정을 향상시킬 수 있는 방법 하나는, 실제 문제에 그 언어를 적용하는 것. 책같은 데 수록된, 규모가 작고 미리 잘 고안해둔 그런 예제만 가지고 공부하는 것은 어차피 한계가 있다.\n학습을 할 때에는 길이가 짧은 피드백 루프를 만들어, 자신의 진척 상황을 측정하는 것이 좋다. 피드백 루프를 만들기 좋은 방법은 TDD.\n언어를 혼자서 배울 수 있겠지만, 전문가들과 교류하지 않으면 그 언어의 진수를 깨우치는 데 오랜시간이 걸릴 수 있다. 특히, 공동체 내에 축적된 경험, 코드의 관용적 표현 방식등은 어떤때는 구전되는 것 밖에 없어 커뮤니티에 소속될 필요가 있다. 단, 최근에는 Effective ~ 와 같은 책들이 이런 미묘한 부분을 다뤄주기도 하므로, 가급적 빨리 이런 책들을 읽는다면 학습 속도도 빨라지고, 흔한 실수를 피하는데에도 도움이 될 것이다.\n💬 이펙티브 코틀린을 사두고 몇달동안 읽지를 않았는데, 근 시일내로 읽어보는게 좋겠다.\n\n흰 띠를 매라\n새로운 지식을 받아들이려면 우리는 과거의 경험과 선입견을 한 켠으로 밀어 둘 수 있어야 한다.\n새로운 지식이 충분히 흡수될 때 까지는 새 지식과 옛 지식이 섞이는 것을 피하고, 새로운 지식에 초보자의 마음가짐으로 접근해야한다. 관용적인 표현에 열려있으면, ‘어떤 언어를 가지고도 포트란처럼 코딩하기’와 같은 문제를 해결할 수 있고, 새로운 지식에 대한 깊은 이해를 얻게 된다.\n새로운 지식과 오래된 지식을 잘 융화시키면, 양쪽으로부터 생산적인 통찰력을 이끌어낼 수 있다.\n\n열정을 드러내라 *\n연구자들은 경험 수준이 다양한 사람들로 구성된 팀이 실제로 더 건강하다는 사실을 발견했다.\n“전반적인 이해력은 서로 다른 여러 수준의 경험이 상호 연관될 때 더욱 높아질 수 있다. 그 무엇도 당연하게 여기지 않는 신참들과, 알 것은 다 안다고 생각하는 고참들이 더 자주 밀접하게 소통할 때가 거기에 해당된다.”\n열정을 드러내는 것이야말로 견습생이 맞아야하는 책무이며, 팀에 열정을 불어넣고 모든것에 대해 질문하는 것이 본분이다. 팀에는 이런 신선한 관점을 지닌 독특한 위치에 있는 사람이 필요하다.\n\n구체적인 기술\n구체적인 기술을 습득해서 유지하라.\n당신이 우러러보는 역량을 가진 사람들의 이력서를 모아보고, 다섯가지 대표적인 역량을 뽑아보라.\n해당 역량이 당신이 들어가고 싶어하는 팀과 유사한 환경에서 쓸모가 있을지 판단해보고, 토이 프로젝트에 대한 계획을 세우고 실행하라.\n\n무지를 드러내라 *\n팀에게 자신이 성장하는 모습을 보여주어라.\n사람들에게 그들이 무엇을 원하는지 이제 당신이 이해하기 시작했고, 그것을 해낼 방법을 배워 가고 있는 중이라고 알려라.\n사람들을 안심시키기 위해 아는 척 하기 보다, 당신이 얼마나 잘 배울 수 있는지를 보여주어라. 당신의 평판은 어떤 지식을 알고 있느냐가 아니라, 학습하는 능력이 얼마나 좋은가를 기반으로 쌓여갈 것이다.\n무지를 드러내는 가장 확실한 방법은 질문하는 것이다. 이는 자존심에 상처를 받는 어려운일일 수 있다. 자존심에 상처를 입지 않는 방법으로 우회하는 것 보다, 질문하는 방법이 가장 가깝게 질러가는 길이다.\n질문하는 과정을 통해 팀에서 자신의 학습 능력을 보여주어라. 그리고 가끔은 사람들이 질문에 대답하는 과정에서 자기가 가진 지식을 새로이 명확하게 할 수 있다.\n“당신의 본능은 당신에게 무지를 숨기고 아는 척하라고 시키지만, 그렇게 하면 당신의 성장을 방해 받으며 성취해야 할 일도 가로막히게 될 뿐입니다”\n이러한 학습 과정에 익숙해져라. 이것이 장인 정신이다.\n장인에게 가장 중요한 특성 중 하나는 학습하는 능력, 즉 무지의 영역을 파악해서 이 영역을 줄이려 애쓰는 것이다.\n💬 나는 무지를 드러내는 것에 아직도 익숙치 않다. 하지만, 최근에는 의식적으로 연습하고 있다. 모르는 것이 있다면 (설령 쉬워 보이는 것이라도), 주변에게 도움을 청하고 지식을 얻는 방식에 익숙해져가고 있다.\n\n무지에 맞서라\n도구나 기법을 하나 고른 다음에 그것과 관련된 지식의 빈틈을 능동적으로 메워라.\n단, 이 패턴은 ‘무지를 드러내라’ 패턴과 함께 적용해야한다. 모든 이들이 몰래 공부하게 되면, 실패와 학습이 용납되지 않은 문화라는 폐단을 가져올 수 있다. 공개적인 학습은 견습생이 숙련공 단계로 발전해 가는 길 중 하나임을 기억해야한다.\n💬 내 전문성을 기르기 위해 기술에 대해 끊임없이 공부하자.\n\n깊은 쪽 *\n당신에게 두드러지는 역할이나 어려운 문제가 주어진다면, 그 기회를 놓치지 말고 두 손으로 꽉 잡아라.\n오히려 실패가 눈앞에 번히 보인다 할지라도 승진이나 해외 발령 같은 제안이 들어왔을 때 그것을 받아들이라는 말이다. 실패를 준비하고 그 실패로부터 일어설 때, 소심한 자들은 결코 볼 수 없는 문이 당신에게 열릴 것이다.\n이 패턴을 적용할 때는 무모하다기보다는 용감한 느낌이 들도록 해야 한다.\n💬 용기를 갖자. 성장하기 위해 지금까지 해온 것 보다 더 어려운 문제를 풀어내자.\n\n한발 물러서라\n너무나 광대한 자신의 무지에 직면하면서 압도당했다면, 평정을 되찾기 위해 자신이 지닌 익숙한 능력 속으로 잠시 후퇴하라.\n견습과정은 롤러코스터를 타는 것과 같다. 새로운 기술을 배우거나, 고객에게 가치를 제공할 때 짜릿함을 느낄 수도 있지만, 그 과정에서 만나는 장인이나 전문가들에 비해 자신이 얼마나 보잘것없는 지식을 가졌는지를 깨닫는, 숨막히는 두려움의 시간도 경험할 것이다. 이것은 긴 여정에 따르는 정상적이고도 회피할 수 없는 현상이다.\n이 패턴은 자신의 능력을 벗어난 데까지 뻗어 보려고 한 사람들과 관련이 깊다. 얼마나 오래, 멀리 후퇴해 있을지 의식적으로 한계를 지어두지 않으면, 두려움과 실패에 굴복하게 된다. 이 패턴은 다시 튀어 오르는 힘을 모으는 동안 필요할 뿐인 단기적인 처방책임을 알아야한다.\n\n3. 긴 여정을 걷다\n\n긴 여정\n이 여행(소프트웨어 장인이 되기 위한 과정)이 얼마나 길어질지에 대해서는 준비가 되어 있어야한다. 자신만의 지도를 그릴 때는 중년의 나이가 되어서도 여전히 현역 소프트웨어 개발자일 것이라는 점을 마음에 새기고 있어야 한다.\n앞으로 10년, 20년, 30년, 40년 뒤를 생각해보며, 그 때 당신이 어떤 종류와 경험을 쌓아왔으면 좋겠는지 상상해보라.\n💬 나는 40대가 되어서도 현역 프로그래머로 살고 싶다. 그때 쯤이면 나도 누군가에겐 존경받는 실력과 영향력 있는 프로그래머가 되어 있겠지? 하지만, 10년 ~ 40년 뒤의 이야기는 아직 잘 상상이 안된다.\n\n예술보다 기예 *\n한 사람의 장인으로서, 예술적 표현에 탐닉하기보다는 다른 이들의 필요를 충족시키는 무언가를 만드는 것이 먼저다.\n만약 당신이 만든것이 너무 아름다워서 실제로 쓰기는 어렵다는 이유로 끼니를 굶는다면, 당신은 장인의 길에서 벗어난 것이다. 사람들에게 유용한 무언가를 만드는것이 프로페셔널한 소프트웨어 개발이다.\n비록 마음에 차지 않더라도, 고객들이 만족할 만한 품질을 지닌 결과물이라면 내놓아야한다.\n“스스로 만족하기 위해서가 아니라 현실 사람들이 당면한 현실적인 문제와 씨름할 때 기량은 연마되는 것”\n고객의 요구(유용성)와, 당신을 장인이게 하는 내면적 기준(아름다움) 사이에서 균형을 잘 맞추어야 한다.\n시스템을 바닥부터 다시 짜려들기 보다는, 리팩터링을 통해 수정해 나가는 능력을 개발해야한다. “우리는 수리를 하면서 그것이 동작하는 원리를 이해하는 경우가 종종 있다.”\n💬 나는 가끔 일을 할 때 우선순위를 생각지 않고 아름다운 코드에 집착할 때가 있다. 성급한 추상화로 되려 이해가 어려운 코드를 짤 때도 있다. 우선순위를 잘 판단하고, 균형을 잡자.\n\n지속적인 동기 부여\n“돈을 벌기 위한 소프트웨어와, 만들기에 재미나는 소프트웨어 사이에는 서로 겹치는 부분이 그다지 많지 않다. (중략) 당신이 돈을 벌고자 한다면, 너무 지저분해서 누구든 공짜로는 해결하려 들지 않는 그런 문제를 안고 씨름해야 할 때가 많다.”\n황금 족쇄: “뭔가 새로운 걸 배우고는 싶지만, 내가 이미 알고있는 것만으로도 벌이가 너무 좋다.”\n긴 여정을 자유로이 갈 것인지 황금 족쇄에 묶일 것인지 택해야 하는 힘든 결정의 시기를 맞게 된다.\n당신이 긴 여정을 걷고 있다면, 당신 삶의 다양한 측면과도 조화를 이루면서도 소프트웨어 장인정신에 대해 열정을 키워 가는 태도가 반드시 필요하다.\n\n열정을 키워라 *\n당신이 좋아하는 일을 하라. 일에서 흥밋거리를 찾고, 그 중 즐길 수 있는 것들을 분별하고, 그 일에 자신을 쏟아 부어라.\n퇴근 후에 시간을 할애하여 부숴도 괜찮은 장난감을 만들어보라.\n“위대한 해커가 되기 위한 열쇠는 좋아하는 일을 하는 것. 무언가를 잘 하고 싶으면 그 일을 좋아해야한다.”\n마음이 맞는 사람을 찾고, 배운 것을 공유하고, 고전을 공부하고, 자신만의 지도를 그려라.\n긴 여정을 걷는 사람들은 몇 년 정도 전력 질주한 후에 그냥 소진되어 버리는 사람이 아니라, 수십 년은 지속할 수 있는 걸음걸이로 움직이는 사람들이다.\n열정을 키우고자 한다면, 당신이 기꺼이 일할 수 있는 주변 환경에 대해 미리 명확한 경계를 지어라. 팀의 다른 사람이 야근할 때 먼저 퇴근하거나, 험한 말이 오가는 회의에서 빠져 나오거나, 냉소적인 대화를 할 때 건설적인 주제로 대화를 돌리려 하거나, 자신의 최저 기준에 부합하지 않는 코드의 배포를 거부하는 것들을 의미한다. 이는 연봉 인상, 승진, 명성, 인기와는 거리가 멀어질 수 있지만, 자신의 열정을 굳게 지키고자 한다면 경계를 명확히 지어야한다.\n“열네 살 때 당신이 프로그래밍에서 느꼈던 경이로움, 그 느낌을 계속 지니도록 노력하기 바랍니다.”\n💬 오래 프로그래머로 일하기 위해, 항상 지속 가능성을 염두해두자.\n\n자신만의 지도를 그려라\n고용주가 제시하는 경력 관리 방향이 모두 당신에게 맞지 않는다면, 논리적이면서 의욕적으로 경력의 다음 단계를 준비하라.\n그 일은 당신의 고용주, 경력 카운슬러, 교수님이 도와줄 수 있는 일이 아니다.\n다음 단계에 도달하고, 궁극적으로 당신이 꿈꾸는 목적지에 이르는 진로를 계획하는 일은 당신 책임이다.\n더 나은 프로그래머가 되고자 하는 목표에 회사의 기대나 문화 같은 것이 방해가 되도록 두지 말라.\n💬 내 스스로의 커리어는 내 자신이 결정하고 책임지자.\n\n직위를 지표로 이용하라\n직위에 비해 다신이 과대 평가 받거나, 과소 평가 받는다는 생각이 들 수 있다.\n그럴 듯한 직함에 속지 마라.\n당신의 직책이 어떤 것인지 기로 상세하게 적어보고, 실제 당신이 하는 일과 당신의 역량 수준을 정확히 반영하라.\n이것을 꾸준히 업데이트하고, 때때로 이런 직책에 있는 낯선 사람을 당신이 어떤 눈으로 바라볼지 상상해보라.\n\n전장에 머물러라\n숙련됨은 연습을 중단하는 그 시점부터 퇴보하기 시작한다. 프로그램을 짜지 않는 하루하루마다 숙련공으로 가는 길은 점점 더 멀어간다.\n만약 기술 관리직 승진 제안을 받았지만 장인의 길에서 벗어나지 않으려면, 다른 형태의 보상 방안(연봉 상승, 기술 리더 역할)을 고용주와 논의하라.\n만약 당신의 조직이 경직된 곳이라면, 승진을 받아들여서 이 길에서 멀어지기보다 다른 곳에서 기회를 찾는 편이 더 나을 것이다.\n💬 나 또한 관리자로 승진해서 코딩과는 멀어지는 커리어를 밟고 싶지 않다. 회사나 인터넷에서 정말 오랜 기간 동안 현업 프로그래머의 커리어를 유지하는 분들을 종종 볼 수 있는데, 정말 멋지고 존경스럽다고 생각한다.\n\n또 다른 길\n만약 당신이 긴 여정 중 자신만의 지도를 그린 결과 이 길은 더이상 당신에게 적절한 선택이 아님을 깨달았다면.\n행여 이 길을 영원히 떠난다고 할지라도, 길을 걸어가며 키워나갔던 가치관과 원칙은 늘 당신과 함께할 것이다.\n교사나 윈드서핑 강사가 되거나, 아이를 키우기 위해 소프트웨어 개발을 떠난 동료들이 있다. 그리고 이렇게 잠시 떠났던 동료가 다시 돌아올 수도 있다.\n하지만 유감스럽게도 대개의 소프트웨어 조직은 이런 경우를 그다지 환영하지 않는듯 하다. 이런 경우 경력상 공백의 정당성을 증명해야 했다.\n이런 위험이 있지만 당신의 삶에서 무언가 다른 일을 해 보는 것을 두려워 하지 말았으면 한다.\n\n4. 정확한 자기 평가\n빠르게 학습하는 사람들이 마주하는 위험 중 하나는 좁은 연못 속 커다란 물고기가 되어버리는 것이다. 작은 연못이나 큰 물고기에게 잘못은 없지만, 큰 물고기가 광대한 연못 네트워크에 속한 다른 연못의 존재를 아는 것은 중요하다.\n재능있고 열심히 일하는 견습생이라면, 그가 이룬 작은 성공에 자족하지 말아야한다. 또한 자기가 제법 능력 있다는 생각 같은 것은 떨쳐버리고, 지금껏 긴 여정에서 얼마 되지 않는 거리를 걸어왔음을 깨달아야한다.\n당신의 목표는 자신의 능력을 평가하고 어제의 자신보다 더 나아질 수 있는 방법을 찾는 것이다.\n\n가장 뒤떨어진 이가 돼라 *\n당신의 배움이 더이상 진전이 없다면, 주변을 당신보다 뛰어난 개발자들로 채워라. 당신이 가장 뒤떨어진 멤버가 되며, 그 안에서 더 성장할 여지가 있는 팀을 찾아라.\n당신의 목표는 가장 못한 사람으로 머무르는 것이 아니라, 밑바닥부터 시작해서 위로 올라가는 것이기 때문이다.\n팀의 다른 사람들과 같은 수준이 될 때까지 의식적으로 개선할 방법을 찾으며 더 뛰어난 개발자들을 모방해 가야 한다.\n팀에서 배우려는 의식적인 노력이 없다면, 팀 전체를 끌어내리거나, 쫒겨날 위험도 감수해야한다.\n이는 가능한 한 빨리 우월한 지위를 얻는 것이 좋다는 시대 문화적 규범과는 배치된다. 하지만 한 사람의 견습생으로서, 당신은 권위를 늘리고 공고히 할 기회보다는 기예를 학습할 기회에 더 가치를 두어야 한다.\n제일 뒤처진 멤버로 의도적으로 팀에 합류하는 것에는 이기적인 면이 있다. 바닥을 쓸어라(팀에 기여하기 위해 하찮은 일을 찾아 나서는 것)와 구체적인 기술 패턴으로 이런 면을 보완해야한다. 이런 기여가 없다면, 이 패턴은 유능한 팀이 치명적으로 약화되는 사태를 불러올 수 있다.\n유능한 팀이 당신과 함께 일하는 리스크를 감수하는 이유는, 당신이 팀에 기여하는 바가 급속히 증가하기 때문이다.\n“내가 가야 하는 길을 이미 지나갔고, 앞에 놓인 구덩이를 피해 갈 방법을 아는 사람들 곁에 있으면서 배우는 기회라면 놓쳐서는 안 된다. 훌륭한 소프트웨어 개발자들과 곁에 있으면서 배우는 기회라면 놓쳐서는 안된다. 훌륭한 소프트웨어 개발자들과 짝을 이뤄 일한다는 것은 헤아릴 수 없는 가치를 지녔다.”\n💬 내가 생각하기엔, 감사하게도(?) 나는 회사에서 가장 뒤떨어진 이다. 나는 이런 좋은 환경에서 느리더라도 끊임 없이 노력하여 꾸준한 성장을 이뤄낼 것이고, 존경받는 탁월한 프로그래머가 될 것이다.\n\n멘토를 찾아라\n당신보다 앞서 지나간 사람들을 찾아서 그들로부터 배우도록 애써라.\n잠재적인 멘토에게 거절당하거나 이상하게 비친다고 해도, 그 리스크는 별 것 아닌 반면에 보상은 아주 크다는 점을 기억해 두라. 그 사람이 당신을 풀타임 견습생으로 받아들이는데는 관심이 없다고 해도, 점심식사라도 같이 하기를 청하는 것은 돈과 시간이 아깝지 않은 일이다.\n당신이 마스터의 경지에 이르는 것을 진지하게 생각한다면, 당신을 지도해 줄 멘터를 끈질기게 찾도록 하라.\n\n마음 맞는 사람들\n추진력을 계속 유지하려면, 특히 전담 멘토가 없는 경우에는, 비슷한 길을 걷고 있는 사람들과 빈번히 교류할 필요가 있다. 그러므로 뛰어난 개발자가 되고자 하는 사람들을 찾아 나서야 한다.\n당신이 사용하는 도구, 언어, 같이 일했던 사람들, 구독하는 블로그, 흥미를 느끼는 아이디어 같은 것들에 기초하여 가입할 만한 커뮤니티들을 조사하고 나열하라. 그 모임에 하나씩 참석해보고 당신에게 가장 흥미로운 그룹을 결정하라.\n\n팔꿈치를 맞대고\n주기적으로 만나는 멘토나 마음 맞는 사람이 있을지 몰라도, 소프트웨어를 개발할 때면 당신은 혼자다.\n다른 소프트웨어 개발자와 나란히 앉아서 실제로 같이 작업할 방법(사이드 프로젝트, 페어 프로그래밍 등)을 찾아보라. 세상에는 다른 개발자와 공통의 목표를 달성하기 위해서 같이 일할때만 배울 수 있는 것이 있다.\n\n바닥을 쓸어라\n단순하고 매력도 없지만 반드시 해야 하는 종류의 일에 자원하라. 이것은 꼭 그럴 필요 없는 일이라도 당신이 훌륭하게 해낸다는 것을 보임으로써 팀의 성공에 일찍 기여하는 좋은 방법이다.\n예를 들면 빌드 시스템 유지보수, 제품화 지원, 유지보수 요청 응대, 버그 수정, 코드 리뷰, 기술적 부채의 청산, 프로젝트 위키 셋업, 문서화 업데이트, 다른 사람의 아이디어에 대한 홍보 담당자 역할 등이 있다.\n이런 종류의 주변적인 일은 주로 팀에 이롭지만, 견습생인 당신 자신에게도 좋은 점이 있다. 학교 수업에서는 대개 허드렛일에 대한 부분은 건너뛰어 버리므로, 이런 일을 맡아 함으로써 당신 지식 사이에 놓인 빈틈을 메울 수 있다.\n불행히도 당신이 받은 (대학) 교육은 생각보다 현장에서 쓸모가 적다. 물론 채용할 때 전산학 학위를 중요하게 치는 조직이 많기는 하지마나, 채용되는 것과 팀에 합류하는 것은 다른 이야기다. 일단 발을 들여놓은 뒤에 당신이 받았던 그 온갖 교육이 하는 역할이란, 출근 첫 날 무엇을 보여줄지 사람들의 기대 수준을 높이는 것 뿐이다.\n이 패턴을 적용해서 생길 수 있는 부정적인 결과가 몇가지 있는데, 팀 내의 잡일꾼으로 굳어져서 아무도 하려 들지 않는 잡다한 일을 도맡게 되는 상황이다. 이런 상황에 처해있다면, 열정을 키우도록 노력하고, 열정을 드러내며, 스스로를 지지해서, 당신이 더 높은 수준의 업무를 맡을 자격이 있음을 증명해 보일 어떤 기회라도 잡도록 하라.\n\n5. 끊임없는 학습\n\n능력의 폭을 넓혀라\n새로운 정보를 얻고자 자기 능력의 폭을 넓히는 단계는 견습생에게 아주 중요하며, 가끔은 압도됨을 느낄 수 있다.\n당신은 새로운 지식을 이해하고 간직하며 적용하는 방법 뿐 아니라, 효과적으로 흡수할 수 있는 테크닉도 발전시켜 가야 한다.\n이 패턴은 소프트웨어 개발 서적 한 권 읽는 정도를 의미하지 않으며, 다양한 차원에 걸쳐서 새로운 지식과 경험을 찾아가는 활동을 수반한다.\n구글 리더와 같은 블로그 모아보기 사이트, 트위터에서 유명인사 팔로우, 메일링 리스트 가입, 로컬 유저 그룹 참여, 기술적 컨퍼런스 참여, 책을 읽은 뒤 저자에게 연락, 온라인 대학 강좌 및 팟캐스트 시청 등 수 많은 방법이 존재한다.\n\n연습, 연습, 또 연습\n지금 하는일에 더 능숙해지고 싶고, 새로운 분야에서 구체적인 기술 개발을 하고자 하지만, 일상적인 프로그래밍 환경에는 실수해 가면서 배울만한 여지가 없다면, 실수해도 마음 편한 환경에서 방해받지 않고 기예를 연마할 시간을 확보하라.\n“소프트웨어를 만들면서 우리는 업무 중에 연습을 하는데, 그것이 업무 중에 실수를 하게 되는 원인이다. 우리는 직업적인 일과 연습을 구분할 방법을 모색해야 한다. 우리에게는 연습 시간이 필요하다.”\n의도적인 수련 기법을 적용하고, 코드 카타를 사용하라.\n“초심자는 강의가 아니라 실제로 해보면서 배운다. 그들은 연습하고 연습하고 또 연습한다. (중략) 이처럼 같은 과제를 거듭 반복함으로써 우리는 자신의 기술을 연마하며, 우리 몸과 마음이 TDD와 단순한 설계의 규율에 감응하도록 훈련한다.”\n\n부숴도 괜찮은 장난감 *\n우리는 실패가 용납되지 않는 환경에서 일하고 있지만, 실패는 종종 무언가를 배울 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법이 된다.\n업무 때와 비슷한 도구를 써서, 개인적인 공간에 토이 시스템을 설계하고 구현하여 실패해 볼 수 있는 여지를 만들어라.\n예를 들면 위키, 캘린더, 주소록을 만드는 것이다.\n단, 이것들은 본디 장난감이며, 재미있어야한다는 것을 잊지 말아야 한다.\n이런 장난감들은 종종 업계 표준이라 할 도구들을 간단하게 재구현한 경우가 많은데, 그렇게 재구현하면서 당신은 그 도구가 지금의 설계에 이를 수 밖에 없었던 여러 이유를 한결 깊이 이해할 수 있게 된다.\n그러던 중 장난감 하나가 생명력을 얻어서 당신 외의 사용자가 생길 수도 있다.\n💬 단순히 프로그램을 구현하는 것을 넘어서, 의도적으로 설계나 성능등에 빈틈을 찾고, 실패시킬 수 있는 (버그를 찾거나, 스트레스 테스트를 하는 등) 일종의 샌드박스를 만든다는 의미에서 이 패턴이 좋다고 생각한다. 실무에서는 의도적으로 실패시키면 큰일나니까.\n\n소스를 활용하라\n프로그래머가 되고자 준비하는 가장 좋은 방법은 프로그램을 짜는 것이며, 다른 사람들이 작성한 뛰어난 프로그램을 공부하는 것이다.\n다른 사람의 코드를 찾아서 읽어라. 그 사람들의 코드를 읽고서 당신은 그들처럼 프로그래밍하는 법을 배우게 되고, 더 중요하게는, 당신을 둘러싼 인프라를 만들어 낸 사고 과정이 어떤 것이었는지 이해하게 된다.\n“프로그래밍 능력을 테스트하는 가장 좋은 방법 중 하나는, 프로그래머에게 30페이지 정도의 코드를 건네주고서 그 사람이 얼마나 빨리 그 코드를 통독하고 이해하는지 보는 것이다.”\n코드에서 신속히 지식을 흡수할 수 있는 사람은 머지 않아 더 우수한 프로그래머가 된다.\n\n일하면서 성찰하라 *\n사색하는 소프트웨어 개발자가 되어라.\n당신 팀의 나머지 사람들이 당연하게 여기는 것들에 대해 스스로 질문을 던져 보라. 만약 자신의 현재 업무 중에서 특별히 괴롭거나 기분 좋은 것이 있다면 왜 그런지 자문해 보라. 만약 괴로운 것이 있다면 그것을 개선할 방법에는 무엇이 있겠는가?\n💬 재직중인 회사의 코어 밸류 중 하나는 ‘Question Every Assumption (모든 기본 가정에 근원적 물음을 제기한다)’ 이다. ‘기존에 하던 대로’ 관성적으로 일을 하게 되면, 발전이 없어진다. 생각 하면서 일하자.\n\n배운 것을 기록하라 *\n과거로부터 배우지 못하는 이들은 같은 일을 되풀이하도록 되어 있다.\n당신이 걸어가는 여정의 기록을 일지나 개인 위키, 블로그 등으로 남겨라.\n이 패턴을 사용하는 사람들은 조만간 까다로운 문제의 해답을 찾을 때 검색엔진의 검색 결과에 자기 위키나 블로그가 나오는 순간을 경험하게 될 것이다.\n당신의 공책, 블로그, 위키 같은 것은 보육원이 되어야지 묘지가 되어버리면 곤란하다. 교훈들이 죽을 자리를 찾아오는 것이 아니라 이 기록으로부터 생겨나도록 해야한다. 그렇게 만들려면 당신이 썼던 글을 정기적으로 다시 읽어라.\n💬 실제로 내 블로그는 종종 구글 검색 결과에 등장하는데, 이럴 때면 기분이 좋다.\n\n배운 것을 공유하라 *\n배운 것을 정기적으로 공유하는 습관(블로그, 모임, 발표 등)을 견습과정 초기에 들여 놓아라.\n누군가를 가르친다는 것은 가르침을 받는 사람보다도 가르치는 사람에게 더 강력한 학습 도구가 된다.\n\n피드백 루프를 만들어라\n당신이 자기 능력에 대해 느끼는 감(자신이 유능해 보이거나, 자신감이 무너지거나)은, 같이 일하는 팀이란 존재에 의해 쉽사리 왜곡될 수 있다.\n다신의 수행 능력을 평가하는 데 어느 정도 객관성 있는 외부 데이터를 정기적으로 수집할 방안을 마련하라. 일찍, 자주, 효과적으로 피드백을 얻으려 애쓰면, 당신은 적어도 자신의 무능함을 자각할 가능성은 높일 수 있을 것이다.\n피드백을 얻는 방법은 TDD, 코드 리뷰, 시험, 자격 증명, 사람들에게 직접 물어보는 방법 등이 있다.\n유용한 피드백이란, 그것을 기반으로 삼아 실천할 수 있는 데이터이며, 특정한 행위를 더 하거나 덜 하도록 선택의 여지를 주는 데이터이다.\n\n실패하는 법을 배워라 *\n“천재성은 종종 잘못 이해된다. 그것은 탁월한 지적 능력의 문제가 아니라 성격의 문제다. 천재성은 무엇보다도 기꺼이 실패를 인지하고, 미봉책으로 가리려 하지 않으며, 변화하고자 하는 의지를 필요로 한다. 그것은 실패에 대한 의도적이고 심지어는 강박적인 성찰과, 새로운 해법에 대한 지속적인 탐색에서 비롯된다.”\n실패는 불가피한 것이다. 그것은 늦든 이르든 간에 모든 이에게 일어난다. 한 번도 실패해 본 적이 없는 사람이라면, 그는 자기 능력의 한계치까지 밀어붙이기를 피해 왔거나 자기 실수를 대수롭지 않게 여기도록 배운 사람이다.\n당신이 어떤 식으로 실패하곤 하는지 확인하고 고칠 부분은 바로 잡아라.\n\n6. 학습 과정의 구성\n\n독서 목록 *\n읽기로 한 책들을 추적해 갈 독서 목록을 유지하고, 다 읽은 책은 기억해두라.\n배운 것을 공유하라 정신에 따라서, 공개된 장소에 당신의 독서 목록을 올려두는 것을 한번 고려해 보라.\n책에서 얻는 가장 귀중한 것 중에 하나는 읽을 가치가 있는 다른 책의 목록이다. 시간이 지나면서 특정한 책이 계속해서 참고 문헌에 나타는 것을 발견하면, 그 책을 독서 목록에 가장 위에다 올려 놓아라. (Code Complete 35장과 The Pragmatic Programmer 의 참고 도서 목록에서 훌륭한 책들을 찾을 수 있다)\n이렇게 만들어낸 독서 목록은 당신의 것임을 기억하라. 당신의 현재 상황은 당신만이 올바르게 알고 있다. 그러므로 다음에 무엇을 학습할지 결정하는 사람은 바로 당신이어야 한다. 그리고 적절한 책을 적절한 시점에 읽는 것 역시 중요하다. 그렇게 하는 것이 현재의 경험과 지식으로는 제대로 이해하지 못할 책들을 쌓아 놓고 우왕좌앙하는 것보다 훨씬 효과적이다.\n💬 적절한 책을 적절한 시점에 읽는 것이 중요하다는 조언은 유용하다. 지금 현재 내가 처해있는 상황에서, 어떤 것을 학습해야 가장 효과가 좋을지 생각하고 학습하는 것이 중요하다.\n\n꾸준히 읽어라\n책을 다 읽은 후에도 그 추진력을 유지하라. 이 다음에 무슨 책을 읽을지, 지금 결정하라. 그 책을 사든지 빌리든지 해서 이 책을 끝내자마자 바로 그 책으로 넘어갈 수 있도록 하여라.\n두껍지 않은 책을 한 권 늘 지니고 다녀. 이렇게 해서 일상생활중에 잠깐식 비는 시간을 학습에 활용할 수 있다.\n\n고전을 공부하라 *\n독학으로 공부했거나 이론보다 기술 훈련을 더 중요시 하는 상당히 실무 중심적인 교육을 받았다면, 고전을 공부하라.\n무지를 드러내서 잘 모르는 개념이 어떤 뜻이며, 어떤 책에서 비롯되었는지 물어보고, 그 책을 당신의 독서 목록에 추가하라.\n성공적인 견습생들은 ‘수명이 긴 책’ (훌륭한 책)에 집중하는 경향이 있다.\n\n더 깊이 파고들어라 *\n당신은 수많은 도구들에 대한 피상적인 지식만 있다면, 미묘한 버그가 발생하거나 깊은 지식이 필요한 일을 할 때 늘 어쩔 줄 몰라 허둥대야 한다는 것을 알게 되었다. 당신의 지식이 너무나 피상적이라서, 어떤 계기나 누군가 때문에 시험에 들기 전까지는 자기가 아는 바가 얼마나 없는지 자각조차 못하는 것이다 (더닝 크루거 효과의 우매함의 봉우리).\n어떤 분야에 깊이 있는 지식을 가졌다는 사실은 당신에게 자신감을 준다. 더 중요한 것은 이런 지식의 깊이가 새로운 분야에 도전할 때 기댈 언덕이 되어주며 앞으로 나갈 힘을 부여한다는 것이다.\n또한 어떤 기술 분야를 깊이 파고든다면, 당신이 작업하고 있는 시스템의 물밑에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 설명할 수 있게 된다는 것이다.\n관점이 변화하면, 시스템의 여러 층위를 뚫고 문제를 쫒아가서 ‘모든 것이 뜻이 통하는’ 수준의 지식을 얻으려는 태도가 생겨난다. 이를테면 싱글코어에서 멀티코어로 노트북을 바꾼 뒤에 자바로 짠 동시성 테스트의 동작이 달라질 수 있다. 어떤 이들은 그저 어깨 한번 으쓱하고서 이제 그 테스트는 예측할 수 없게 동작한다고 생각하고 말 것이다. 하지만 다른 이들은 동시성 라이브러리, 자바 메모리 모델, 물리적 하드웨어 명세 같은 것을 통해 CPU 수준까지 문제를 쫒아갈 것이다.\n우리에게 필요한 것은 실행 중인 프로그램의 속을 들여다 볼 수 있게 해주는 디버거, 네트워크 트래픽을 볼 수 있는 통신 레벨 디버거, 명세서를 기꺼이 읽고자 하는 태도가 있다.\n근원적인 곳으로부터 정보를 얻자. 예를 들자면, 누군가 REST에 대한 이야기를 한다면, 이 경험을 REST의 원 개념이 정의된 로이 필딩의 박사 학위 논문을 읽을 이유로 생각해야 한다는 것이다. 이렇게 알게 된 것을 명확히 하거나 공유하기 위해서 블로그에 글로 정리해 보라.\n어떤 개념을 정말로 이해하려면 위키 백과, 알기 쉽게 풀어서 써 놓은 책, 그것을 인용한 블로그 등의 말을 그대로 받아들이지 않고, 그 개념이 최초로 언급된 당신의 전후 맥락을 재구성해 볼 필요가 있다. 이렇게 해야 개념의 정수가 그 모든 중간자들을 거치고도 살아남았을을 확인할 수 있다.\n그 아이디어를 누가 처음 생각해냈는지 조사하고, 그들이 풀려고 했던 문제가 무엇인지 이해하라. 이와 같은 역사적인 맥락에 관한 내용은 보통 그 개념이 전달되는 과정에서 사라진다.\n이와 같이 심도있는 이해에 초점을 맞출 때는, 뜻하지 않게 좁은 한 가지 분야에 대한 전문가의 길로 빠져버리는 일이 없도록 해야한다. 당신의 목표는, 소프트웨어 개발의 여러 측면이 지닌 상대적인 중요도에 대한 관점을 잃지 않으면서, 어떤 문제를 해결하는 데 필요한 지식을 가능한 한 많이 습득하는 것이다.\n표면적인 지식만 가졌을 때 초래될 수 있는 또 다른 결과는, 풀려고 하는 문제에 대해 잘 알려진 해법이 있는지 혹은 실질적으로 해결이 불가능한 문제인지 전혀 모를 수 있다는 것이다.\n수박 겉핥기식으로만 해서는 지금 모르는 것을 앞으로도 모를 것이며, 자기 지식의 한계가 어디까지인지 이해하지 않고 새로운 것을 깨달을 수는 없다.\n어떤 문제에 대해 모든 층위를 통틀어 조사하는 과정에서 밑바닥에 깔려 있던 전산학적 개념들이 드러나는 일이 흔하다. 단지 알고리즘이나 자료구조를 바꿨을 뿐인데, 몇 달씩 걸리던 배치 작업이 마우스 버튼을 다 누르기도 전에 끝날 수도 있다 (다른 사람에게는 마법처럼 보이는 일).\n이 패턴을 정기적으로 실천한다면, 당신은 자기 도구가 어떻게 동작하는지 진정으로 이해하는 사람들 중 하나가 될 것이다. 당신은 더 이상 코드 조각을 짜깁기 해놓고서 일이 되게 하려고 다른 사람들이 마법을 부려 주기를 바라지는 않을 것이다.\n💬 최근에 왜 깊이 있는 지식을 알고 있어야 하는지 이해했다. 깊이 있는 지식을 많이 알고 있는 사람일수록, 문제가 발생할때의 문제 해결 능력과 잠재적인 문제를 예방하는 예측 능력이 뛰어나다. 나는 이를 ‘문제 해결의 해상도가 높다’ 라고 표현한다. 문제 해결의 해상도가 높은 사람은, 문제 상황에서 자신이 택할 수 있는 선택지가 그렇지 않은 사람들보다 높다. 현대의 소프트웨어는 규모가 매우 크고, 복잡하고, 무겁다. 이런 소프트웨어를 잘 다루기 위해서는 깊이 있는 지식과 이해를 겸비해야겠다.\n\n익숙한 도구들\n익숙한 도구들을 선별해서 거기에 집중하라. 시간이 흐르면서 당신은 도구들이 편안하게 느껴질 것이다.\n이것은 생산성이 높아진다는 점에서 유익한 일이지만, 위험도 또한 존재한다. 조심하지 않는다면 당신은 이런 익숙한 도구들을 어떤 문제라도 해결할 수 있는 도깨비 방망이로 여기기 시작할지도 모른다.\n장담하건대, 당신이 견습생 때 쓰던 도구들은 숙련공이 되고 나서는 더이상 소용이 없다. 때가 되면 당신이 즐겨 쓰는 도구들은 모두 폐물이 될 것이다.\n당신의 경력이 성공적이려면, 익숙한 도구들을 쉽게 얻고 쉽게 버리는 법을 배워야한다.",

버려지는 개’를 키워드로 반려동물에 대한 이야기를 준비했습니다.\n우리나라 네 집 중 한 집은  반려동물을 키운다고 합니다. 반려가구가 늘고, 인식이 조금씩 변화하면서 반려동물과 함께 떠나는 휴가는 더 이상 낯선 풍경도, 유난한 일도 아닌 게 되었습니다. 강아지와 함께 앉아 비행할 수 있는 국내외 노선이 늘고 있고, 전국 지자체에서 운영하는 반려동물 전용 해수욕장부터 호텔 리조트 업계에서도 반려동물과 함께 즐길 수 있는 다양한 시설과 프로그램을 선보이고 있어요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*KB경영연구소 ⟨2023 한국 반려동물 보고서⟩에 따르면 2022 말 기준, 한국 반려가구는 522만 가구로 전체 가구의 25.7%로 조사됐다.\n한국관광공사에 따르면 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}반려동물 동반 여행객의 연간 지출 규모는 당일 여행만 1조 3,960억 원, 숙박 여행은 9,187억 원에 달합니다. 반려동물을 동반한 가구는 동반하지 않은 가구보다 3배가 넘는 돈을 쓴다는 연구 결과도 있고요.\n하지만 이런 변화가 무색할 만큼, 여전히 휴가철에 많은 동물들이 길 위로 내몰립니다. 2022년 유기된 반려동물은 8만여 마리. 휴가철인 5~8월에 많이 유기되었고, 추석 연휴가 있는 9월*이 그 뒤를 이었습니다. 특히, 전국 고속도로 휴게소에는 매년 100마리가 넘는 반려동물들이 유기됩니다.\n*동물자유연대 ⟨2022 유실·유기 동물 발생 분석 보고서⟩\n유기를 줄이기 위한 법과 제도는 단계적으로 마련되고 있습니다. 2개월 이상의 반려견을 시,군,구청에 반드시 등록해야 하는 ‘동물등록제'는 2014년부터 시행되고 있어요. 2021년에는 동물보호법이 개정되면서 동물을 유기할 경우, 300만 원 이하의 과태료 부과에서 벌금형으로 강화되었고요. 하지만 여전히 법과 제도, 처벌이 충분치 않다는 의견이 많습니다.\n전문가들은 법과 제도, 처벌의 강화와 더불어 반려동물 보호자의 책임감이 무엇보다 중요하다고 강조합니다. 유기의 가장 큰 원인으로 꼽히는 ‘돌봄 비용'을 (예비)보호자가 현실적으로 감각하고 있어야 한다는 거죠. 모든 반려동물은 병들고 늙는다는 것, 반려동물의 일평생을 함께 하는 데에는 결코 적지 않은 시간과 비용이 필요하다는 것을요. 반려동물과의 행복한 삶을 위해 우리가 준비해야 하는 것은 무엇일까요? 전문가와 함께 지극히 현실적인 이야기를 나누어 보았습니다.\n\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}강아지 20세

동반 가능한 장소가 늘어나는 등 법률도 사람들의 인식도 조금씩은 발전하는 것 같은데요, 우리나라의 반려견 관련 상황이나 추세는 어떠한가요?\n우리나라의 동물보호복지 수준과 정책은 질적으로 발전하고 있습니다. 2016년 강아지공장 사태가 사회적으로 이슈화된 뒤에 동물생산업이 등록제에서 허가제로 강화됐고, 동물생산업뿐만 아니라 동물판매업, 동물위탁관리업, 동물운송업, 동물수입업, 동물장묘업 등 반려동물 관련 영업의 시설·인력 기준도 점차 강화되고 있거든요. 또한, 최근에는 개식용종식특별법이 제정되어 2027년부터 우리나라에서 개 식용이 금지됩니다.\n한편 여전히 부족한 점도 많습니다. 동물등록제가 2014년부터 전국적으로 시행되면서 2개월령 이상의 반려견을 양육하면 반드시 동물등록을 해야 하는데요, 아직도 약 절반 정도의 반려견 보호자가 동물등록을 하지 않은 것으로 추정됩니다. 사람으로 치면, 아이를 낳아놓고 출생 신고도 안 하는 거죠. 출생과 사망에 대한 정확한 통계가 없기 때문에 절반이라는 것마저 추정할 수밖에 없고요.\n또, 일부 반려견 보호자들은 외출 시 목줄·하네스 착용, 대변 치우기 등을 지키지 않으면 과태료 대상임에도 기본적인 펫티켓을 지키지 않아서 비반려인과 반려인 사이의 갈등을 유발하기도 합니다. 무엇보다, 아직까지 우리나라에서 동물의 법적 지위는 ‘물건’입니다. 이를 바꾸기 위해 동물의 법적 지위 관련 법에 “동물은 물건이 아니다”라는 조항을 추가하는 개정안이 발의됐었지만, 국회 문턱을 넘지 못하고 결국 임기만료 폐기됐습니다. 다음 국회에서는 꼭 민법이 개정되어 동물이 물건이 아닌, 생명으로 취급되기를 기대합니다.\n“휴가철은 반려동물들의 위기철”이라는 동물보호단체의 인터뷰를 보고 경악했습니다. 아직도 휴가철과 명절에 많은 개들이 버려진다고요. 요즘은 얼마나 많은 개들이 버려지고 있나요?\n2022년 한 해 동안 발생한 유기동물은 총 11만 3,440마리*였습니다. 그중 유기견은 8만 393마리였고요. 아직도 누군가는 강아지를 산에 버리고, 누구는 섬에 버리고, 누구는 고속도로 휴게소에 버려요. 통계에서 버려진 동물을 한 마리 단위까지 셀 수 있는 것은 동물보호센터에 입소된 개체를 집계한 수치이기 때문입니다.\n*출처: 농림축산식품부 반려동물보호·복지 실태조사\n동물보호센터에 입소한 개들은 어떻게 되나요.\n유기동물에는 버린 게 아니라 잃어버리고 못 찾게 된 유실동물도 포함됩니다. 2022년에 입소한 유기견 약 8만 마리 중 약 27.5%는 입양돼서 새로운 보호자와 함께 살게 됐어요. 12.4%는 원래 키우던 보호자에게 인도됐습니다. 잃어버린 개가 센터로 들어왔을 때 동물등록이 되어 있으면 가족을 찾아줄 수 있는 거죠.\n반면, 26.9%의 개는 안락사 됐고, 16.8%는 동물보호센터에서 자연사했습니다. 여전히 전체 유기견의 절반 가까이가 보호소 안에서 생을 마감하는 거예요. 동물보호센터는 세금으로 운영되고, 공간의 한계가 있기 때문에 유기동물을 평생 관리할 수 없습니다. 일정 기간이 지나면 안락사를 시킬 수밖에 없죠. 반려동물 양육을 고민한다면 분양 이전에 유기동물 입양도 고려해보시길 권하는 이유입니다.\n아직도 유기동물이 이렇게 많다는 게 놀랍습니다. 이를 방지하려면 반려견 입양을 결심하기 전에 시간, 돈, 마음의 준비를 충분히 해야 할 텐데요, ‘강아지 20세 시대'라는 말은 현실인가요?\n보호자의 관심과 케어 수준이 높아지고, 수의학과 동물영양학이 점점 발달하면서 양질의 의료서비스를 받고, 좋은 사료를 먹는 반려동물이 늘어나고 있습니다. 그러면서 반려동물의 기대 수명도 증가하고 있어요. 최근에는 15살이 넘은 개, 고양이를 쉽게 볼 수 있으며, 20살 이상 사는 경우도 많습니다. 따라서 반려동물과 함께할 거라면 ‘앞으로 20년간 내가 책임진다’는 마음가짐으로 입양하셔야 합니다.\n일반적으로 반려견의 기대 수명은 대형견보다 소형견이 길어요. 크기가 작은 품종일수록 일반적으로 더 오래 산다는 뜻입니다. 따라서 내가 대형견을 양육한다면, 소형견보다는 기대 수명을 짧게 생각해야 합니다. 우리나라에서 많이 양육하는 소형견을 기준으로 보면, 7살이 넘어가면 노령화가 시작되고 11살이 넘으면 노령견으로 보고 더 신경을 써줘야 합니다. 또, 소형견이라고 해서 무조건 15살, 20살까지 살 수 있는 것도 아니에요. 개들은 “제가 어디가 아파요\"라고 말하지 못하기 때문에 정기적인 검진과 예방을 추천드립니다.\n처음 반려견과 가족이 될 때, 우리나라 사람들은 평균 얼마 정도의 값을 치르고 있나요?\n2023년 조사 결과*를 보면 반려동물을 기르게 된 경로 1위는 지인에게 무료로 받음(46.7%)이었습니다. 우리나라에서 반려동물을 기르는 사람의 절반 정도는 아는 사람에게 동물을 공짜로 받아서 키우고 있다는 뜻입니다. 예를 들어, 친척이 사정상 강아지를 못 키우게 돼서 우리 집에 맡겼거나, 친구가 기르던 개가 새끼를 낳았는데 한 마리를 키워보라고 주는 경우 등이 여기에 해당합니다. 동물판매업소(펫숍)에서 분양받아 키운다는 응답률은 14.6%였고, 지자체 동물보호센터나 민간동물보호시설에서 유기동물을 입양했다는 응답률은 6.4%에 그쳤습니다. 2021년 동물보호국민의식조사에 따르면 펫숍에서 분양받을 때 평균 비용은 마리당 49만 8,000원이었다고 합니다.\n*출처: 동물복지문제연구소 어웨어의 동물복지에 대한 국민의식조사\n공짜로, 혹은 50만 원으로 맞이하는 가족에 대해 생각해보게 되네요. 만약 돈을 내서라도 꼭 강아지를 키우고 싶다면 또 다른 경로도 있을까요?\n현재 펫숍에서 분양되는 강아지, 고양이는 대부분 동물생산업(번식장) - 동물경매장 - 펫숍의 경로를 거칩니다. 다른 경로를 생각해보자면 ‘브리더(breeder)'가 있어요. 품종이 우수한 견종의 번식을 돕는 견종 전문가를 뜻하는데, 좁은 공간에서 동물을 사육하지 않고, 유전병이 있는 개체는 부모견에서 제외한 뒤 자견이 태어나면 모견과 충분한 시간을 보낼 수 있게 하는 등 적합한 기준을 가진 분들이 늘어나고 있습니다.\n브리더에게 분양을 청하면 자견이 없는 경우 예약을 받고, 교배, 임신, 출산, 초기 관리를 거쳐요. 5분 만에 강아지를 살 수 있는 숍과는 달리 실제 만날 때까지 수개월이 걸리기도 합니다. 대신 비용은 비싼 편입니다.\n독일에서 반려동물을 키우려면 자격시험을 통과해야 한다던데, 우리나라도 기본 교육이 있는지 궁금합니다.\n독일에는 반려동물을 키우기 전에 시험을 보고 일정 자격을 취득해야 동물을 키울 수 있도록 허가해주는 제도가 있습니다. 니더작센주의 ‘개를 키울 수 있는 자격증(Sachkundenachweis)’ 제도가 대표적입니다. 마치 자동차 운전면허처럼 이론·실기시험을 치르는 형태인데, 맹견 품종뿐만 아니라 품종·크기에 상관없이 모든 반려견 보호자가 시험을 통과해야 개를 기를 수 있습니다. 아무런 사전 의무 교육 없이 반려동물을 쉽게 분양받을 수 있는 우리나라와 비교하면 상대적으로 더 큰 책임감을 가지고 동물을 기를 가능성이 크겠죠?\n우리나라는 최근 맹견사육허가제를 시행했습니다. 맹견 품종(도사견, 핏불테리어, 아메리칸 스태퍼드셔테리어, 스태퍼드셔불테리어, 로트와일러 5개 품종 및 이 품종의 잡종개)을 키우려면 사전에 기질평가를 받고 지자체의 허가를 받아야만 합니다. 맹견이 아닌 품종은 아무런 제약 없이 키울 수 있긴 한데요, 동물사랑배움터 사이트에서 ‘.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}반려동물 입양 전 교육’ 온라인으로 제공하고 있으니, 반려동물을 키우기 전에 확인해보시기 바랍니다.\n삶의 질이 오로지 내 의지에 달린 \n생명과 함께 사는 일\n병치레가 많았던 반려견을 17살에 보낸 지인이 “계산해보니 강아지에게 1억 원 썼더라”라는 말을 하더라고요. 반려견을 위한 씀씀이도 사람마다 차이가 클 텐데 한 강아지의 일생을 함께 보내는 데 드는 기본적인 돈은 얼마나 될까요?\n2023년 ‘동물복지에 대한 국민의식조사’에 따르면, 반려동물 한 마리당 월평균 양육비용은 12만 6,600원이었고, 그중 병원비는 4만 3,800원이었습니다. 한 달 평균 동물병원비가 4만 3,800원이라니 생각보다 적게 느껴지실 것 같은데요, 실제 반려동물의 평균 병원비는 이 정도가 듭니다. 하지만 크게 아파서 수술을 받거나 지속적인 관리가 필요한 질병에 걸리면 큰 비용이 들다 보니 보호자의 부담이 커집니다. 펫보험이나 반려동물을 위한 적금을 미리 드는 일도 필요하죠.\n반려동물 평균 양육비 중 아무래도 가장 큰 비용은 사료간식비(펫푸드 구매 비용)입니다. 오픈서베이의 ‘반려동물 트렌드 리포트 2023’에 따르면, 반려동물 양육비 1위 항목은 사료, 간식, 영양제 등 펫푸드 구매비용이었어요. 반려견·반려묘의 한 달 평균 양육비는 14만 8,700원으로 위에 언급한 것보다 조금 더 높게 조사됐고, 그중 절반에 가까운 7만 1,700원을 매월 펫푸드(사료, 간식, 영양제 등) 구매에 사용하는 것으로 나타났습니다.\n아무래도 어릴 때와 나이 들었을 때 의료비가 많이 들 것 같아요. 강아지에게 필수인 초기 접종에는 어떤 것들이 있나요?\n강아지 기초예방접종은 생후 6~8주 정도부터 시작해서 2~3주 간격으로 5~6회 맞추는 게 일반적입니다. 디스템퍼(강아지 홍역), 간염, 파라인플루엔자, 파보장염을 예방해 주는 종합백신, 코로나장염 백신, 기관지염을 유발하는 켄넬코프 백신, 광견병 백신, 독감(개 인플루엔자) 백신을 맞게 됩니다. 이후 1~3년 간격으로 추가 접종을 하고요. 정확한 종류와 일정은 개체마다 다릅니다.\n다른 것은 조사 대상이 아니어서 평균 가격을 알 수 없지만, 동물병원 진료비용 현황 조사 공개에 따르면 개 종합백신의 평균 가격은 1회에 25,991원, 광견병 백신의 평균 가격은 24,427원, 켄넬코프 백신의 평균 가격은 21,889원입니다.\n사람은 인생 전체 의료비의 70%를 노년기에 쓴다는 통계를 보았습니다. 노령견의 경우도 그럴까요? 노령견에게는 어떤 케어가 필요한지요?\nKB경영연구소의 2021년 한국 반려동물 보고서에 따르면, 반려견의 연평균 병원비는 1세 미만(0~1세)일 때가 41만 2,000원으로 2세(29만 1,000원), 3세(32만 7,000원), 4~5세(38만 원)보다 더 많이 드는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 이는 강아지가 어릴 때 기초예방접종과 중성화수술을 받기 때문이겠지요. 이후 나이가 들수록 반려견의 연령별 병원비는 빠르게 증가합니다. 앞에서 소형견 기준으로 7살부터 반려견의 노령화가 시작된다고 셜명드렸는데요, 실제로 6~7세 47만 2,000원, 8~9세 70만 8,000원, 10~14세 94만 1,000원으로 나이가 들어감에 따라 평균 병원비도 증가하는 걸 알 수 있습니다.\n같은 조사에서 노령견 보호자들은 노령견 양육에 있어 필요하다고 느낀 서비스로 노령견 전문 정보 제공 및 상담(30.5%), 반려동물 장례 서비스(19.1%), 반려동물 보험(12.2%), 반려동물 간병(8.4%), 펫로스증후군 극복 프로그램(7.6%) 등을 꼽았습니다. 노령견을 키울 때 병원비뿐만 아니라 관리에 대한 여러 가지 부담과 반려견이 떠난 이후의 처리와 우울감에 대한 걱정도 함께 증가한다는 걸 알 수 있어요.\n반려견이 무지개다리를 건너고 나서는 어떤 절차를 밟아야 하는지도 궁금합니다.\n우리나라에서 합법적으로 반려동물의 사체를 처리하는 방법은 3가지입니다. 첫 번째는 종량제 쓰레기 봉투에 담아서 일반쓰레기로 버리는 것입니다. 앞서 우리나라에서 반려동물의 법적 지위는 ‘물건’이라고 설명드렸죠? 따라서 반려동물의 사체도 물건처럼 쓰레기봉투에 담아서 버려야 합니다. 그런데 아무리 합법적인 방법이라 하더라도 가족처럼 키운 반려동물을 쓰레기봉투에 담아버려야 한다는 건 납득하기 어려운 게 사실입니다.\n두 번째는 동물병원을 통해 처리하는 방법입니다. 동물병원에 사체 처리를 부탁하면 동물병원에서 의료폐기물로 처리해 줍니다.\n세 번째는 반려동물 장례식장(동물장묘업)을 통해 화장하는 방법입니다. 전국적으로 합법적인 반려동물 장례식장이 현재 70개 이상 있습니다. 소형견 기준 기본 장례비용은 30만 원 정도 하고, 여기에 관, 수의 등을 선택하면 비용이 추가됩니다. 비용이 발생하지만, 반려동물 장례식장을 이용하는 분들이 점점 늘어나고 있습니다.\n반려동물을 땅에 묻어주는 경우가 여전히 많은데요, 모두 불법입니다. 자기 소유의 땅에 묻어도 폐기물관리법 위반으로 처벌될 수 있으니, 반려동물 사체는 위의 3가지 방법 중 하나로 처리해야 합니다.\n반려견과 함께하는 삶을 준비하는 사람들에게 마지막으로 들려주고 싶은 이야기가 있다면요?\n반려동물을 기르는 건 오랫동안 돈이 드는 일입니다. 실제로 많은 보호자들이 돈 때문에 양육 포기를 고민하는 순간을 맞이한다고 합니다. 사료, 용품, 예방접종, 구충 등 정기적으로 드는 비용이 있고, 그 외에도 질병, 사고 등으로 예상치 못한 비용이 추가되곤 합니다. 호텔링 등 보호 비용도 발생하고, 반려동물 동반 식당, 반려동물 동반 호텔, 반려동물 입장 허용 카페에 가기 위해 조금 더 비싼 비용을 내야 할 수도 있습니다. 따라서 반려동물을 양육하기 전에 내가 경제적으로 반려동물을 잘 케어할 수 있을지 충분한 고민을 해보길 당부드립니다. 그렇지 않은 채 반려동물을 덜컥 키우면 나에게도, 그리고 반려동물에게도 고통이 될 수 있습니다.\n이외에도 반려견 양육 전에는 모든 가족 구성원이 동의했는지, 나의 주거환경에 맞는 품종을 선택했는지, 반려동물과 보낼 시간이 충분히 있는지, 결혼, 입대, 유학, 이사 등 인생의 변화가 언제 생길지 등을 신중하게 생각해보시길 바랍니다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은, 이지영 Graphic 조수희",

(중략)\n\n\n개인투자용 국채는 매월 20일 발행됩니다. 지난 6월 처음으로 개인투자용 국채를 10년물 1,000억원, 20년물 1,000억원으로 청약이 진행됐습니다. 10년물은 만기가 10년짜리, 20년물은 만기가 20년짜리인 국채를 말해요.\n1차 청약 결과는 10년물 경쟁률은 3.49대 1이 나올 정도로 흥행에 성공했고, 20년물 경쟁률은 0.76대 1로 미달로 나타났습니다.\n이는 단기적으로 금리가 오르는 속도가 완화될 것이라는 예상과 국채 금리가 상승할 것이라는 기대에 따른 투자자들의 선호가 10년물에 반영된 것으로 보이고요. 장기 금리의 변동성 우려, 투자 수익률이 감소할 가능성 등을 고려했을 때 20년물은 인기가 없었던 것으로 분석됩니다.\n그래서 기획재정부는 2차 청약인 7월 발행 물량은 인기 있는 10년물 금액을 1,500억 원까지 늘리고 20년물 금액은 500억 원으로 줄여서 입찰하기로 조정하였습니다. 자세한 내용은 아래를 참고해서 투자를 결정해보세요.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n매입 한도: 1인당 연 최대 1억원 (최소 10만원)\n청약 증권사: 미래에셋증권 단독\n발행 종목: 10년물, 20년물\n금리:\n\n적용금리: ‘표면금리 + 가산금리’에 연 복리 적용\n※ .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}중도환매 시 ‘표면금리’에 단리 적용 (가산금리, 연복리, 분리과세 미적용)\n표면금리: 전월에 발행한 동일 연물 국고채의 최고 낙찰금리 적용\n가산금리: 시장 상황 등 고려해 매월 결정·공표\n\n\n이자 지급방식: 만기일에 원금과 이자를 한꺼번에 지급\n거래: 상속·유증·강제집행 외에 소유권 이전 불가\n세제 혜택: 만기까지 보유 시, 이자소득에 대해 14%(지방세 포함 15.4%) 세율로 매입액 총 2억원까지 분리과세 적용\n* 현재 기준 금융소득 2,000만 원 넘으면 종합과세 대상이 됨. 개인투자용 국채 투자로 얻은 이자 소득은 금융소득종합과세 과세표준에 포함되지 않고 분리과세가 적용되기 때문에, 과세표준 높은 사람일수록 절세 혜택 커질 수 있음\n발행 횟수: 연 11회 (매해 1월~11월)\n\n\n\n발행시장과 유통시장: 금융시장은 발행시장과 유통시장으로도 분류할 수 있습니다. 발행시장은 주식이나 채권을 발행하여 투자자로부터 돈을 빌리는 시장이고, 유통시장은 이미 발생된 채권이나 주식이 투자자들 사이에서 거래되는 시장이에요.\n복리채: 중간에 이자를 지급하지 않고 이자를 원금에 가산해 재투자한 뒤, 만기상환 때 원금과 이자를 함께 지급하는 채권. 이자가 계속 더해지며 복리 효과를 누릴 수 있기 때문에 복리채라 하는데요. 개인투자용국채에 여기에 속합니다. 반대 용어는 이표채예요. 복리채와 달리 투자자에게 일정 기간마다 이자를 나눠서 지급하는 채권을 말해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
