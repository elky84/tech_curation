        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are thrilled to announce that Proxy 3, our latest and greatest solution for polymorphism in C++, is now feature complete! Since the library was initially open-sourced, we have heard much positive feedback and received many brilliant feature requests. Big thanks to all of you who have contributed any code or idea that made the library better!\nOur Mission\n“Proxy” is a modern C++ library that helps you use polymorphism (a way to use different types of objects interchangeably) without needing inheritance.\n“Proxy” was created by Microsoft engineers and has been used in the Windows operating system since 2022. For many years, using inheritance was the main way to achieve polymorphism in C++. However, new programming languages like Rust offer better ways to do this. We have improved our understanding of object-oriented programming and decided to use pointers in C++ as the foundation for “Proxy”. Specifically, the “Proxy” library is designed to be:\nPortable: “Proxy” was implemented as a single-header library in standard C++20. It can be used on any platform while the compiler supports C++20. The majority of the library is freestanding, making it feasible for embedded engineering or kernel design of an operating system.\nNon-intrusive: An implementation type is no longer required to inherit from an abstract binding.\nWell-managed: “Proxy” provides a GC-like capability that manages the lifetimes of different objects efficiently without the need for an actual garbage collector.\nFast: With typical compiler optimizations, “Proxy” produces high-quality code that is as good as or better than hand-written code. In many cases, “Proxy” performs better than traditional inheritance-based approaches, especially in managing the lifetimes of objects.\nAccessible: Learned from user feedback, accessibility has been significantly improved in “Proxy 3” with intuitive syntax, good IDE compatibility, and accurate diagnostics.\nFlexible: Not only member functions, the “abstraction” of “Proxy” allows any expression to be polymorphic, including free functions, operators, conversions, etc. Different abstractions can be freely composed on demand. Performance tuning is supported for experts to balance between extensibility and performance.\nThe New Look\nComparing to our previous releases, there are some major improvements in the syntax and utilities. Let’s get started with some examples!\nHello World\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\n#include \"proxy.h\"\r\n\r\nstruct Streamable : pro::facade_builder\r\n    ::add_convention<pro::operator_dispatch<\"<<\", true>, std::ostream&(std::ostream& out) const>\r\n    ::build {};\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  std::string str = \"Hello World\";\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p1 = &str;\r\n  std::cout << \"p1 = \" << *p1 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p1 = Hello World\"\r\n\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p2 = std::make_unique<int>(123);\r\n  std::cout << \"p2 = \" << *p2 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p2 = 123\"\r\n\r\n  pro::proxy<Streamable> p3 = pro::make_proxy<Streamable>(3.14);\r\n  std::cout << \"p3 = \" << *p3 << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"p3 = 3.14\"\r\n}\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n#include <iostream>: For std::cout.\n#include <string>: For std::string.\n#include \"proxy.h\": For the “Proxy” library. Most of the facilities of the library are defined in namespace pro. If the library is consumed via vcpkg or conan, this line should be changed into #include <proxy/proxy.h>.\nstruct Streamable : pro::facade_builder ... ::build {}: Defines a facade type Streamable. The term “facade” is how the “Proxy” library models runtime abstraction. Specifically,\n\npro::facade_builder: Provides capability to build a facade type at compile-time.\nadd_convention: Adds a generalized “calling convention”, defined by a “dispatch” and several “overloads”, to the build context.\npro::operator_dispatch<\"<<\", true>: Specifies a dispatch for operator << expressions where the primary operand (proxy) is on the right-hand side (specified by the second template parameter true). Note that polymorphism in the “Proxy” library is defined by expressions rather than member functions, which is different from C++ virtual functions or other OOP languages.\nstd::ostream&(std::ostream& out) const: The signature of the calling convention, similar with std::move_only_function. const specifies that the primary operand is const.\nbuild: Builds the context into a facade type.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p1 = &str: Creates a proxy object from a raw pointer of std::string. p1 behaves like a raw pointer, and does not have ownership of the underlying std::string. If the lifetime of str ends before p1, p1 becomes dangling.\nstd::cout << *p1: This is how it works. It prints “Hello World” because the calling convention is defined in the facade Streamable, so it works as if by calling std::cout << str.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p2 =std::make_unique<int>(123): Creates a std::unique_ptr<int> and converts to a proxy. Different from p1, p2 has ownership of the underlying int because it is instantiated from a value of std::unique_ptr, and will call the destructor of std::unique_ptr when p2 is destroyed, while p1 does not have ownership of the underlying int because it is instantiated from a raw pointer. p1 and p2 are of the same type pro::proxy<Streamable>, which means you can have a function that returns pro::proxy<Streamable> without exposing any information about the implementation details to its caller.\nstd::cout << *p2: Prints “123” with no surprise.\npro::proxy<Streamable> p3 = pro::make_proxy<Streamable>(3.14): Creates a proxy from a double without specifying the underlying pointer type. Specifically,\n\nSimilar with p2, p3 also has ownership of the underlying double value, but can effectively avoid heap allocation.\nSince the size of the underlying type (double) is known to be small (on major 32- or 64-bit platforms), pro::make_proxy realizes the fact at compile-time and guarantees no heap allocation.\nLibrary “Proxy” explicitly defines when heap allocation occurs or not to avoid users falling into performance hell, which is different from std::function and other existing polymorphic wrappers in the standard.\nstd::cout << *p3: Prints “3.14” with no surprise.\nWhen main returns, p2 and p3 will destroy the underlying objects, while p1 does nothing because it holds a raw pointer that does not have ownership of the underlying std::string.\nMore Expressions\nIn addition to the operator expressions demonstrated in the previous example, the library supports almost all forms of expressions in C++ and can make them polymorphic. Specifically,\nThe PRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH macro: Defines a dispatch type for member function call expressions.\nThe PRO_DEF_FREE_DISPATCH macro: Defines a dispatch type for free function call expressions.\nThe pro::operator_dispatch class template: Dispatch type for operator expressions.\nThe pro::conversion_dispatch class template: Dispatch type for conversion expressions.\nNote that some facilities are provided as macros, because C++ templates today do not support generating a function with an arbitrary name. Here is another example that makes member function call expressions polymorphic:\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include <sstream>\r\n\r\n#include \"proxy.h\"\r\n\r\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemDraw, Draw);\r\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemArea, Area);\r\n\r\nstruct Drawable : pro::facade_builder\r\n    ::add_convention<MemDraw, void(std::ostream& output)>\r\n    ::add_convention<MemArea, double() noexcept>\r\n    ::support_copy<pro::constraint_level::nontrivial>\r\n    ::build {};\r\n\r\nclass Rectangle {\r\n public:\r\n  Rectangle(double width, double height) : width_(width), height_(height) {}\r\n  Rectangle(const Rectangle&) = default;\r\n\r\n  void Draw(std::ostream& out) const {\r\n    out << \"{Rectangle: width = \" << width_ << \", height = \" << height_ << \"}\";\r\n  }\r\n  double Area() const noexcept { return width_ * height_; }\r\n\r\n private:\r\n  double width_;\r\n  double height_;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstd::string PrintDrawableToString(pro::proxy<Drawable> p) {\r\n  std::stringstream result;\r\n  result << \"entity = \";\r\n  p->Draw(result);\r\n  result << \", area = \" << p->Area();\r\n  return std::move(result).str();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  pro::proxy<Drawable> p = pro::make_proxy<Drawable, Rectangle>(3, 5);\r\n  std::string str = PrintDrawableToString(p);\r\n  std::cout << str << \"\\n\";  // Prints: \"entity = {Rectangle: width = 3, height = 5}, area = 15\"\r\n}\nHere is a step-by-step explanation:\n#include <iostream>: For std::cout.\n#include <sstream>: For std::stringstream.\n#include \"proxy.h\": For the “Proxy” library.\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemDraw, Draw): Defines a dispatch type MemDraw for expressions of calling member function Draw.\nPRO_DEF_MEM_DISPATCH(MemArea, Area): Defines a dispatch type MemArea for expressions of calling member function Area.\nstruct Drawable : pro::facade_builder ... ::build {}: Defines a facade type Drawable. Specifically,\n\nadd_convention: Adds calling conventions to the build context.\nsupport_copy<pro::constraint_level::nontrivial>: Specifies the underlying pointer type shall be copyable, which also makes the resulting proxy type copyable.\nclass Rectangle: An implementation of Drawable.\nFunction PrintDrawableToString: Converts a Drawable into a std::string. Note that this is a function rather than a function template, which means it can generate ABI in a larger build system.\npro::proxy<Drawable> p = pro::make_proxy<Drawable, Rectangle>(3, 5): Creates a proxy<Drawable> object containing a Rectangle.\nstd::string str = PrintDrawableToString(p): Converts p into a std::string, implicitly creates a copy of p.\nstd::cout << str: Prints the string.\nOther Useful Features\nIn addition to the features mentioned above, here is a curated list of the most popular features based on user feedback:\nOverloading: facade_builder::add_convention is more powerful than demonstrated above. It can take any number of overload types and perform standard overload resolution when invoking a proxy.\nFacade composition: facade_builder::add_facade allows flexible composition of different abstractions.\nWeak dispatch: When an object does not implement a convention, and we do not want it to trigger a hard compile error, it is allowed to define a “weak dispatch” with macro PRO_DEF_WEAK_DISPATCH from an existing dispatch type and a default implementation.\nAllocator awareness: Function template allocate_proxy is able to create a proxy from a value with any custom allocator. In C++11, std::function and std::packaged_task had constructors that accepted custom allocators for performance tuning, but these were removed in C++17 because “the semantics are unclear, and there are technical issues with storing an allocator in a type-erased context and then recovering that allocator later for any allocations needed during copy assignment”. These issues do not apply to allocate_proxy.\nConfigurable constraints: facade_builder provides full support for constraints configuration, including memory layout (by restrict_layout), copyability (by support_copy), relocatability (by support_relocation), and destructibility (by support_destruction).\nReflection: proxy supports type-based compile-time reflection for runtime queries, specifically with facade_builder::add_reflection and function template proxy_reflect.\nSummary\nWe hope this library could empower more C++ users outside Microsoft to write polymorphic code easier. The full documentation of Proxy 3 will be published soon. Please stay tuned for more technical details. We are also actively working on several ISO C++ proposals for further standardization.\nThe post Announcing the Proxy 3 Library for Dynamic Polymorphism appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By Jiangwei Pan, Gary Tang, Henry Wang, and Justin Basilico\nIntroduction\nOur mission at Netflix is to entertain the world. Our personalization algorithms play a crucial role in delivering on this mission for all members by recommending the right shows, movies, and games at the right time. This goal extends beyond immediate engagement; we aim to create an experience that brings lasting enjoyment to our members. Traditional recommender systems often optimize for short-term metrics like clicks or engagement, which may not fully capture long-term satisfaction. We strive to recommend content that not only engages members in the moment but also enhances their long-term satisfaction, which increases the value they get from Netflix, and thus they’ll be more likely to continue to be a member.\nRecommendations as Contextual Bandit\nOne simple way we can view recommendations is as a contextual bandit problem. When a member visits, that becomes a context for our system and it selects an action of what recommendations to show, and then the member provides various types of feedback. These feedback signals can be immediate (skips, plays, thumbs up/down, or adding items to their playlist) or delayed (completing a show or renewing their subscription). We can define reward functions to reflect the quality of the recommendations from these feedback signals and then train a contextual bandit policy on historical data to maximize the expected reward.\n\nImproving Recommendations: Models and Objectives\nThere are many ways that a recommendation model can be improved. They may come from more informative input features, more data, different architectures, more parameters, and so forth. In this post, we focus on a less-discussed aspect about improving the recommender objective by defining a reward function that tries to better reflect long-term member satisfaction.\nRetention as Reward?\nMember retention might seem like an obvious reward for optimizing long-term satisfaction because members should stay if they’re satisfied, however it has several drawbacks:\n\nNoisy: Retention can be influenced by numerous external factors, such as seasonal trends, marketing campaigns, or personal circumstances unrelated to the service.\nLow Sensitivity: Retention is only sensitive for members on the verge of canceling their subscription, not capturing the full spectrum of member satisfaction.\nHard to Attribute: Members might cancel only after a series of bad recommendations.\nSlow to Measure: We only get one signal per account per month.\n\nDue to these challenges, optimizing for retention alone is impractical.\nProxy Rewards\nInstead, we can train our bandit policy to optimize a proxy reward function that is highly aligned with long-term member satisfaction while being sensitive to individual recommendations. The proxy reward r(user, item) is a function of user interaction with the recommended item. For example, if we recommend “One Piece” and a member plays then subsequently completes and gives it a thumbs-up, a simple proxy reward might be defined as r(user, item) = f(play, complete, thumb).\n\nClick-through rate (CTR)\nClick-through rate (CTR), or in our case play-through rate, can be viewed as a simple proxy reward where r(user, item) = 1 if the user clicks a recommendation and 0 otherwise. CTR is a common feedback signal that generally reflects user preference expectations. It is a simple yet strong baseline for many recommendation applications. In some cases, such as ads personalization where the click is the target action, CTR may even be a reasonable reward for production models. However, in most cases, over-optimizing CTR can lead to promoting clickbaity items, which may harm long-term satisfaction.\nBeyond CTR\nTo align the proxy reward function more closely with long-term satisfaction, we need to look beyond simple interactions, consider all types of user actions, and understand their true implications on user satisfaction.\nWe give a few examples in the Netflix context:\n\nFast season completion ✅: Completing a season of a recommended TV show in one day is a strong sign of enjoyment and long-term satisfaction.\nThumbs-down after completion ❌: Completing a TV show in several weeks followed by a thumbs-down indicates low satisfaction despite significant time spent.\nPlaying a movie for just 10 minutes ❓: In this case, the user’s satisfaction is ambiguous. The brief engagement might indicate that the user decided to abandon the movie, or it could simply mean the user was interrupted and plans to finish the movie later, perhaps the next day.\nDiscovering new genres ✅ ✅: Watching more Korean or game shows after “Squid Game” suggests the user is discovering something new. This discovery was likely even more valuable since it led to a variety of engagements in a new area for a member.\n\nReward Engineering\nReward engineering is the iterative process of refining the proxy reward function to align with long-term member satisfaction. It is similar to feature engineering, except that it can be derived from data that isn’t available at serving time. Reward engineering involves four stages: hypothesis formation, defining a new proxy reward, training a new bandit policy, and A/B testing. Below is a simple example.\n\nChallenge: Delayed Feedback\nUser feedback used in the proxy reward function is often delayed or missing. For example, a member may decide to play a recommended show for just a few minutes on the first day and take several weeks to fully complete the show. This completion feedback is therefore delayed. Additionally, some user feedback may never occur; while we may wish otherwise, not all members provide a thumbs-up or thumbs-down after completing a show, leaving us uncertain about their level of enjoyment.\n\nWe could try and wait to give a longer window to observe feedback, but how long should we wait for delayed feedback before computing the proxy rewards? If we wait too long (e.g., weeks), we miss the opportunity to update the bandit policy with the latest data. In a highly dynamic environment like Netflix, a stale bandit policy can degrade the user experience and be particularly bad at recommending newer items.\nSolution: predict missing feedback\nWe aim to update the bandit policy shortly after making a recommendation while also defining the proxy reward function based on all user feedback, including delayed feedback. Since delayed feedback has not been observed at the time of policy training, we can predict it. This prediction occurs for each training example with delayed feedback, using already observed feedback and other relevant information up to the training time as input features. Thus, the prediction also gets better as time progresses.\n\nThe proxy reward is then calculated for each training example using both observed and predicted feedback. These training examples are used to update the bandit policy.\nBut aren’t we still only relying on observed feedback in the proxy reward function? Yes, because delayed feedback is predicted based on observed feedback. However, it is simpler to reason about rewards using all feedback directly. For instance, the delayed thumbs-up prediction model may be a complex neural network that takes into account all observed feedback (e.g., short-term play patterns). It’s more straightforward to define the proxy reward as a simple function of the thumbs-up feedback rather than a complex function of short-term interaction patterns. It can also be used to adjust for potential biases in how feedback is provided.\nThe reward engineering diagram is updated with an optional delayed feedback prediction step.\n\nTwo types of ML models\nIt’s worth noting that this approach employs two types of ML models:\n\nDelayed Feedback Prediction Models: These models predict p(final feedback | observed feedbacks). The predictions are used to define and compute proxy rewards for bandit policy training examples. As a result, these models are used offline during the bandit policy training.\nBandit Policy Models: These models are used in the bandit policy π(item | user; r) to generate recommendations online and in real-time.\n\nChallenge: Online-Offline Metric Disparity\nImproved input features or neural network architectures often lead to better offline model metrics (e.g., AUC for classification models). However, when these improved models are subjected to A/B testing, we often observe flat or even negative online metrics, which can quantify long-term member satisfaction.\nThis online-offline metric disparity usually occurs when the proxy reward used in the recommendation policy is not fully aligned with long-term member satisfaction. In such cases, a model may achieve higher proxy rewards (offline metrics) but result in worse long-term member satisfaction (online metrics).\nNevertheless, the model improvement is genuine. One approach to resolve this is to further refine the proxy reward definition to align better with the improved model. When this tuning results in positive online metrics, the model improvement can be effectively productized. See [1] for more discussions on this challenge.\nSummary and Open Questions\nIn this post, we provided an overview of our reward engineering efforts to align Netflix recommendations with long-term member satisfaction. While retention remains our north star, it is not easy to optimize directly. Therefore, our efforts focus on defining a proxy reward that is aligned with long-term satisfaction and sensitive to individual recommendations. Finally, we discussed the unique challenge of delayed user feedback at Netflix and proposed an approach that has proven effective for us. Refer to [2] for an earlier overview of the reward innovation efforts at Netflix.\nAs we continue to improve our recommendations, several open questions remain:\n\nCan we learn a good proxy reward function automatically by correlating behavior with retention?\nHow long should we wait for delayed feedback before using its predicted value in policy training?\nHow can we leverage Reinforcement Learning to further align the policy with long-term satisfaction?\n\nReferences\n[1] Deep learning for recommender systems: A Netflix case study.

Plugin developers can now safely access and modify the workspace model, benefiting from a centralized API, bulk updates, coroutines, and a persistent data structure.\nThis update is particularly relevant for developers working on build tool integration plugins, such as Maven, Gradle, BSP, Bazel, and others. Additionally, it will be useful for any plugin developers who interact with the JPS project model, known for classes like Module, Library, Facet, ModuleManager, IdeModifiableModelsProvider, and others.\nNew Implementation of the JPS project model\nSome time ago, we announced the reimplementation of project models. The IntelliJ platform still supports old interfaces like Module and ModuleManager to maintain compatibility with existing plugins. However, the new Workspace Model API is now also available for public use. Plugin developers are encouraged to update their code from the old API to the new API. More information on code migration can be found here.\nThe Workspace Model is designed to store any entities, including those defined by plugins. However, defining custom entities is still an experimental part of the API and will be released later. Currently, working with the Workspace Model is limited to using entities provided by the platform.\nBenefits of the Workspace Model\nThe Workspace Model is designed as a persistent data structure, enabling it to handle various multithreading use cases. A snapshot of the storage is immutable and can be processed without a read lock. Batch operations like replaceBySource and applyChangesFrom are designed to support scenarios involving significant updates to the workspace model.\nCompared to the previous implementation of the project models, the Workspace Model keeps everything in one storage, there is a single entry point for all updates, and there is no need to create multiple modifiable models as before. Also, as the old project model API now delegates to the Workspace Model, accessing the new API directly may improve the performance, especially for massive operations or big projects.\nThe flexibility of the Workspace Model allows the entire IntelliJ Platform to change the way we work with the project model. Rather than using specific managers, the subsystem can define extension points that can be contributed by other subsystems. For example, the new WorkspaceFileIndex operates on entities provided by different parts of the IDE instead of directly using the ModuleManager.\nThe event flow allows you to observe all changes occurring within the storage. Every update can be used to incrementally affect subsystems that depend on Workspace Model data. This feature has been utilized to remove some internal implementations of AdditionalLibraryRootsProvider and DirectoryIndexExcludePolicy, which were recalculated from scratch on each change of the project models, leading to improved performance of JetBrains IDEs.\nFurther evolution\nThe new Workspace model is already used in several places. The Rider IDE was the first client of the Workspace Model, and it still actively uses it. The Maven import was rewritten to the new API, giving a boost in performance. Different parts of GoLand, WebStorm, and the Kotlin plugin also started to use the new approach, gaining different benefits.\nThe next steps for the Workspace Model will focus on allowing plugin developers to define and use their own entities. This will make it possible to describe the project model of a build tool with specific entities that accurately reflect the structure of the project.\nCurrently, updates to the Workspace Model occur under a write lock. Future updates will eliminate this requirement, allowing updates to happen without acquiring any locks.\nThe IntelliJ platform still mostly uses the old API for working with the project models, however, all new code will be written using the new Workspace Model API. The subsystems that will benefit from the performance of the new API will also be migrated.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By: Leo Wong, Henry Johnson\nHow the Airbnb Media team built group travel Postcards for the 2024 Summer Release by leveraging a novel destination matching algorithm while advancing the platform’s image & localized text processing capabilities.\nAirbnb Postcards (see announcement).\nIntroduction\nFor Airbnb’s 2024 Summer Release, the Media Ingestion team at Airbnb took on the exciting challenge of creating a reliable postcard generation system to generate unique, hand-crafted Postcards. Postcards are a beautiful way to invite guests on a trip while keeping friends and family in the loop (see announcement). This feature required a novel solution to match relevant postcards to every possible destination that guests booked on Airbnb. It needed to render performantly not only on all our client platforms (iOS, Android, and Web), but also on different messaging platforms outside the Airbnb app, all while maintaining Airbnb’s high design standards.\nChallenges\n\nLocalized Text Layout: Postcards have strict design guidelines around character count per line, font leading & kerning per language, pixel perfect typography, line break rules, and language-specific styling.\nDesign & Product Flexibility: Text layout, color, fonts, text drop shadows and image transformations need to be flexible for product & design changes.\nDestination Matching: Postcards need to match the destination by including relevant artwork and localized destination names.\nAvailability On and Off Platform: Assets need to be surfaced on and off the platform, which necessitated a pre-generated server-side solution; client-only solutions wouldn’t work since we needed Open Graph compatible links for assets to render properly in iMessage and Instagram, for example.\nPerformance: Postcard presentation shouldn’t interrupt the product UX by taking significant time to render.\nPostcards “in vs. out” of product experience\nSolution\nPostcard Setup\nA Trips Postcard is the combination of (1) an artwork illustration, (2) a postcard template, and (3) a localized destination. A Postcard “template” is a data entity with a reference to the artwork illustration plus some additional metadata to describe how to render it. To render a Postcard in product, we need to have all artwork illustrations, postcard templates, and formatted localized destinations set up before a visitor sees the product flow.\nIn the example below, we have an illustration of a cliff side, a postcard template, and an English language variant of the destination name “Galway”. The Postcard template includes parameters to specify how to create the postcard, like text and Belo (Airbnb brand icon) color and positioning. In the example, the text and Belo are rendered in gray color and positioned at the bottom and top left, respectively.\nIllustration + Template Params + Localized Destination = Postcard\nDesign Flexibility — Postcard Templates\nTo accommodate changing design requirements, we built a flexible template data model that empowers our design team to configure various parameters like text positioning and text color while iterating on the designs. The postcard templates include all the metadata required to generate a Postcard and its surrounding presentation elements. It also includes a versioning capability so that we can publish changes to all users with a version bump whenever we have a design revision or visual defect.\nTemplate & Artwork Upload, Management & Preview\nTo make it easy for the creative team to self-serve and debug issues, we built a web-based internal tool for creating and managing templates, previewing postcards, and uploading artwork. This tool made it significantly easier to manage templates, and was especially useful during the team’s peak iteration period where we were constantly fixing bugs and changing designs.\nThe postcard template creation & management formIn the setup workflow, our operations team created Postcard templates, uploaded artwork, and managed them via the template form page.\nLocalized Text Layout\nWe wanted accurate translations of destinations that were properly formatted for each localized postcard. A programmatic solution for localized text layout would require, at the very least, language specific rules (right to left, word wrapping, etc.), knowledge of cultural conventions, accessibility considerations, and text rendering for special characters (diacritics, etc.). This would make business logic complex and brittle.\nWe compromised on this solution with the localization (l10n) team by manually formatting translations for destinations that made up our top booking destinations. These manually formatted translations involved getting our l10n scaled operations team to translate and format (line breaks, layout spacing, etc.) a shortlist of localized destinations, which we helped ingest into our typical i18n platform translated text workflow with some scripting. After ingestion, the Postcard generation system pulls from our i18n platform to get the desired localized formatted text layout for each Postcard.\nThe destinations shortlist was informed by our data science team, who helped gather the top booked destinations by language. This reduced the scale of required postcards to generate from all destinations in the full set of language locale destination combinations on the platform, to a magnitude of scale smaller destination subset. As a result, postcard QA was significantly easier. More importantly, it kept the overall system code and maintenance simple; no need for thousands of lines of language specific business logic!\nThe rest of the postcards that didn’t make the top destinations list followed a simple formula of word count and line breaks per language (e.g. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese had smaller word count limits because of the character size and no line break on spaces because it changes the meaning of the destination).\nEarly design prototype of text layout in a subset of the languages we support at Airbnb. The screenshot is for illustration purposes only.\nPostcard Generation\nDestination Matching\nDecision tree for determining the best postcard template for a given reservation\nTo find the best-matching postcard template for each destination, we have a matching algorithm that matches templates to reservations at booking time using four different criteria:\n\nBy listing — We wanted to be able to support listing-specific artwork. E.g. Our Icons listings show a golden ticket to commemorate the special moment when a guest wins the lottery for staying at an Icons listing.\nBy destination — For popular destinations (matching by city and country), we have curated artwork that showcases both a local artist and the destination. E.g. Trips to Santorini present the iconic Cycladic domes of Santorini as artwork (see diagram below).\nBy taxonomy — For all other artwork, we match destinations based on a set of taxonomy tags. We partnered with the knowledge graph team to apply taxonomy attributes to all of our listings in a few different categories: density (i.e. metropolitan, urban), climate (i.e. tropical, temperate) and geography (i.e. coastal, mountain, river). We ensured the taxonomy was accurate by cross referencing existing internal data and the expertise of our regional representatives teams. They then exposed an API that we called to fetch taxonomy by listing. On the operations side, our production team created taxonomy tagged artwork (e.g. an artwork tagged to be used for a coastal, temperate, metropolitan postcard). When generating postcards, we match the listing to the artwork with the highest number of overlapping tags.\nBy default — If a destination isn’t covered by the above categories, we show a fallback default artwork.\nThe 4 initial Postcard variants: Icons, Destination specific, Taxonomy, and Default.\nFormatted Translations\nWe take the listing of each booking request and fetch the city and country from the listing service and check to see if that destination was in our curated set of formatted destinations loaded into our i18n service. We then take the best fitting artwork and embed the localized destination text on it to generate the final postcard. If we don’t get a translation back, we fall back to serving the postcard without text.\nPerformance — Async Postcard Creation Flow\nPutting a localized destination and a Belo icon onto artwork is a time-consuming operation given the high resolution artwork we used. We knew the image processing flow could take over 8 seconds on average to process an image so we needed to come up with a way to make our postcard API respond quickly. We also wanted to transfer these generated postcards into our primary image storage so we could leverage our existing media serving infrastructure, which introduced an additional 1–2 seconds of latency.\nIn order to still be performant, we went with a partly asynchronous approach where, during the live in product request, we only serve postcards that we’ve already generated and stored internally. If there was a request for a new postcard, we would instead return a fallback postcard and publish an event to a Kafka queue where an async consumer would call the processing service, wait for the asset to be generated and then transfer it into our system to be used for future requests.\nAs shown in the diagram below, we fetched the listing information and taxonomy information in parallel before computing the best matching artwork for the trip. Based on a pattern in how the postcards are stored, we would check in our media service to see if the postcard was generated already before either returning the card if it was found or kicking off the asynchronous flow if it was not found. At that point, our media service’s Kafka consumer would complete the flow by transforming the asset into a postcard and storing it in our system.\nArchitecture Diagram of the Backend Postcard Generation flow\nPre-generation\nWe wanted to generate as many of the postcards as possible before the launch. If the postcard hasn’t been generated when a guest books a group trip, everyone on the booking will see the default, generic postcard. Our data science team helped determine top destinations, and we ran those inputs through our postcard generation pipeline to pre-generate as many postcards as possible and minimize the chance of falling back to a default postcard. Within a week of launching, more than 90% of trips had a custom postcard instead of a default and we inched closer to generating a postcard for all trips in the months after.\nDashboard numbers on Postcard template selection type and postcard usage hit rate. For illustrative purposes only, not real data.\nConclusion\nCreating postcards was a massive effort that required collaboration across multiple engineering, product, design, and data science teams to improve Airbnb’s group travel feature. Our frontline insights team continues to receive positive social media and external feedback on this update that adds delight to joining a group trip.\nThe solution highlights the importance of having the right internal tooling, image and text processing capabilities, and destination matching logic for solving something at Airbnb’s scale.\nPostcards is one of the first major image processing use cases that the Media team built to support a new Airbnb feature. It highlights the power of media capabilities and innovative features we can build with them.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 17.11 now brings exciting advancements from GitHub Copilot! This release significantly improves how GitHub Copilot integrates into your development workflow, offering smarter and more intuitive coding assistance.\nDiscover the new GitHub Copilot features in Visual Studio, such as enhanced context understanding, improved code completions, and AI insights for debugging and naming. These updates aim to boost your productivity and efficiency in coding. To try these new features, download the update, make sure to activate your GitHub Copilot account and check out the release notes for more detailed information.\nGitHub Copilot is getting smarter\nGitHub Copilot Chat now enables you to reference your complete solution, which allows you to gain an even deeper, holistic understanding of your solution to get better results! To reference your solution, simply use @workspace, and Copilot will respond to high-level questions regarding your solution, files, and their interactions.\n\nAdditionally, GitHub Copilot Enterprise users in Visual Studio can now use @GitHub to get answers enriched with context from their entire repository and Bing search results.\n\nNaming things made easy\nGitHub Copilot can now generate naming suggestions for your C++ identifiers (variables, methods, or classes) based on how your identifier is being used and the style of your code.\n\nTo try it out, you’ll need an active GitHub Copilot subscription. Navigate to any variable you wish to rename, right-click -> Rename (Keyboard: Ctrl+R, Ctrl+R). You’ll notice a GitHub Copilot sparkle icon that you can click or toggle to generate naming suggestions.\nAI-generated breakpoint expressions\nAI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints are now supported in C++. GitHub Copilot analyzes your code and offers insightful breakpoint expressions, streamlining your debugging process.\n\nWhen you place the cursor in the condition text for a conditional breakpoint/tracepoint in the breakpoint settings window, GitHub Copilot will instantly generate AI-based expression suggestions tailored to your code. You can choose the condition that best suits your needs.\nUnderstand your symbols with GitHub Copilot\nWe’ve integrated GitHub Copilot into the tooltip on hover over symbols to provide AI-generated summaries of the selected symbol. This is available for both C# and C++ developers.\n\nThis feature assists developers in understanding descriptions of various symbols at different invocations within their codebase. By hovering over a symbol and selecting the ‘Tell me more’ option, GitHub Copilot can generate documentation for the selected symbol.\nRefine your GitHub Copilot suggestions\nIn Visual Studio 17.11, you can now refine code completions by adding context or asking questions without accepting them first. This update allows you to modify and retry GitHub Copilot’s suggestions before having to accept, saving you the hassle to accepting and refining again! Just press Alt+/ to modify, or if you’re happy with the suggestion, press tab to accept.\n\nGitHub Copilot is even more secure\nIntroducing GitHub Copilot Content Exclusion, a new feature that allows admins to Copilot to ignore specific files in a repository or organization, ensuring sensitive information is protected while using AI for efficient coding. This applies to Completions, Inline, Chat, for GitHub Copilot for Business and Enterprise users. Additionally, exclusions also apply to other non-chat features, like rename suggestions and hover text. Additionally, content exclusion works with repos on platforms other than GitHub, including Azure DevOps.\n\nWe hope you enjoy this update to Visual Studio and all the new developments happening within GitHub Copilot, and we look forward to hearing what you think. You can share feedback with us by using the thumbs up or down within the Chat, via Developer Community, by reporting issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn and on Microsoft Learn.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nDownload Visual Studio 17.11\n\nThe post New GitHub Copilot features in Visual Studio 2022 17.11 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nIn Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11, you will find brand new productivity enhancements for your game development workflows. From faster conditional breakpoints to a swath of Unreal Engine enhancements, we have added various productivity boosters based on your feedback. Once again, thank you for sharing Developer Community feedback and answering our surveys. Your valuable feedback continues to drive the direction of the Visual Studio gaming team.\nGeneral C++ Game Development\nSupercharge Your IntelliSense Performance\nWe have received feedback from AAA developers about IntelliSense performance. While we have improved performance over the past releases, we understand that these performance improvements may be less impactful for large C++ projects.\nHere are some helpful tips to further boost the power for Visual Studio’s IntelliSense for developers with powerful hardware:\nEnsure 64-bit IntelliSense is activated.\n\n\nAdjust your memory limits (in MB) to reflect your hardware.\n\n\nFaster Conditional Breakpoints\nIn version 17.11, you will see a significant improvement in performance for conditional break points. Our initial assessment found that execution time is almost four times as fast, reducing execution time from 80 seconds to 21 seconds over 80,000 iterations.\nBuild Insights Quality of Life Improvements\nWe have added several quality-of-life enhancements to Build Insights. Starting in version 17.11, you can now group your results by project, view the relative path and file name in place of the full path, and see a better grouping of results in the Included Files view.\n\nUnreal Engine Integration\nAdding Unreal Engine Classes, Modules, and Plugins\nIn Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11, you can now add Unreal Engine class templates, modules, and plugins. These new productivity features are available for both vcxproj and uproject.\nTo get started, right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select Add > Unreal Engine Item.\n\nIn the revamped Add New Item dialog, you can select several new choices.\n\nUnreal Engine Classes\nBased on your feedback, we have added additional Unreal Engine class templates. You can now find the common class templates in Visual Studio’s Add New Item dialog just as you would find in the Unreal Engine Editor. The new dialog provides a list of common Unreal Engine class templates that you can add to your project. You can also now add your class to a module of your choice.\n\nUnreal Engine Module\nYou can now also add an Empty Unreal Engine Module using the Add New Item dialog.\n\nUnreal Engine Plugin\nLastly, you can now add an Unreal Engine Plugin to your project through the Add New Item dialog.\n\nUnreal Engine Toolbar\nTo further streamline our integration with Unreal Engine, we have added the Unreal Engine toolbar in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11. The toolbar contains new productivity features and shortcuts to existing integration.\n\nThe play icon and the dropdown work in tandem to quickly attach to processes while debugging. With the Unreal Editor running, you will see Unreal Engine related processes. Selecting one of the choices will allow you to easily attach to the process to start a debugging session. Additionally, you can type any process name to quickly attach to that process.\n\n\nThe start and stop button will control the Unreal Engine integration server, used for the Unreal Engine Test Adapter. The server runs as a background process that automatically updates your test information. If you have the Unreal Engine Test Adapter option active, the server will automatically start upon opening your UE project.\nThe Rescan Blueprints button will refresh your Unreal Engine Blueprint references.\nThe Unreal Engine Log button is a shortcut to open the Unreal Engine Log window, in case you close it accidentally.\nThe Configure Tools for Unreal Engine button is a shortcut to launch the Unreal Engine Integration Configuration window. The configuration page gives you an overview of the Unreal Engine Integration status and gives you help if certain integrations were not configured properly.\nBlueprints Update\nWe received feedback asking to improve the process of setting up Blueprint references in Unreal Projects. Starting in Visual Studio v17.10, you will no longer need the Unreal Engine Plugin “Visual Studio Integration Tool” to view Blueprint references. Blueprint references will automatically show up if you have the “Visual Studio Tools for Unreal Engine” component installed.\nSend us your feedback\nWe hope you enjoy this update to Visual Studio, and we look forward to hearing what you think. You can share feedback with us via Developer Community, by reporting issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, and on Microsoft Learn.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nThe post C++ Gaming Productivity Update for Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 효율적인 딥러닝 모델링을 위한 시계열 데이터 처리 방법을 정리한다. \n\n\n머리말\n시계열 해석을 위해 UCM(Unobserved Component Model)과 같은 방법이 개발되었다. 이는 상태공간 모델이라 불리고, 시계열 데이터를 개별 수준, 추세, 주기, 계절 구성 요소로 분해하고, 이 요소를 처리해 모델링하여, 미래값을 예측한다. \n\n\n참고로, UCM은 통계 모델로 관찰할 수 없는(Unobserved) 요인들에 관찰된 데이터에 어떻게 영향을 미치는 지 설명하는 모델이다. UCM은 계량 경제학 등 분야에서 사용되고 있다. \n\n\nUCM 모델에서 시계열 데이터는 트랜드(trend), 계절성(seasonality), 사이클(cycle), 불규칙성(irregular component) 등 구성요소로 분해될 수 있다.\n\n\n트렌드(Trend) 컴포넌트: 장기적인 상승 또는 하강 경향을 나타내는 요소이다. 예를 들어, 경제 성장으로 인한 판매 증가와 같은 장기적인 패턴을 설명할 수 있다.\n계절성(Seasonality) 컴포넌트: 주기적으로 반복되는 패턴을 설명하는 요소이다. 예를 들어, 계절에 따른 기후 변화로 인해 매년 여름에 증가하는 에어컨 판매량이 이에 해당한다.\n사이클(Cycle) 컴포넌트: 계절성보다 더 길고 불규칙한 주기를 나타내는 요소이다. 주로 경제적 사이클(경기 순환)과 같이 장기적인 변동성을 설명할 때 사용된다.\n불규칙성(Irregular) 컴포넌트: 예측할 수 없는 무작위적인 변동 요소로, 모델로 설명할 수 없는 데이터를 설명한다.\n\nUCM은 다양한 분야 시계열 데이터 분석 및 예측에 사용된다. \n\n\n시계열 데이터 처리 \n이 글에서 사용될 데이터셋은 Kaggle의 '시간당 에너지 소비량'이다. 이 소스는 미국 전역 서비스 지역에서 매시간 보고된 에너지값(Mega watts)이 포함되어 있다(예.

Ubuntu, Microsoft Korea, NHN Cloud, 안랩 클라우드메이트, GroMetric, WhaTap Labs와 한빛미디어에서 큰 도움을 주셨습니다.**\n무엇보다 서울 시내에서 원활하게 행사를 진행할 수 있도록 올해도 도움을 주신 Microsoft Korea의 공로를 뺴놓을 수 없습니다. ”우분투 리눅스“에서 주최하는 커뮤니티 행사를 위해서 금요일 저녁과 토요일 아침에 지원을 와주신 MS Korea 담당자님에게 다시 한번 감사드립니다. 서울 시내에 위치한 경관좋은 곳에서 이런 큰 행사를 진행할 수 있도록 지원해주신 Microsoft Korea뿐만 아니라 분들에게 감사의 인사를 드립니다. 내년에도 혹은 다음에도 좋은 인연으로 계속할 수 있기를 바랍니다.\n배포\n올해 주제는 ‘배포’입니다. 아마 국내에서 가장 많은 사용자를 가지고 있는 리눅스 배포판은 AL2일 것으로 예상됩니다. 도커와 같은 가상화 도구가 많이 활용되면서 어쩌면 Alpine Linux가 많이 활용될지도 모르겠습니다. 웹서비스를 사용하는 대부분의 팀은 최종 배포에 리눅스 운영체제를 선택하는 경우가 많아지고 있습니다.\n단순히 서비스를 배포한다는 관점에서 벗어나서 “전달” 혹은 “연결”이라는 개념을 포괄해서 구성된 세션으로 구성되었습니다. 개발의 끝단이자, 서비스의 시작이라 할 수 있는 배포라는 개념을 여러 분야의 활용 사례를 보여드릴 수 있도록 노력하였습니다. 리눅스 그 중에서 우분투 리눅스를 활용해서 서비스를 “전달”하고, 이기종 컴퓨터를 “연결”하고, 더 나아가 우리가 만든 소프트웨어를 “배포”하는데 활용할 수 있다는 개념이나 관점이 작게나마 전달되었기를 바랍니다. 올해 행사가 많은 분들에게 리눅스에서 무언가를 전달하는 것에 대한 개념이나 관점에 작은 도움이 되었기를 희망해봅니다.\n마지막으로, 2025년에 다시 뵙겠습니다.",

NHN Cloud에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 도입하여 시스템의 안정성을 높이고, 더 큰 장애 상황으로 이어질 수 있는 문제를 효과적으로 예방할 수 있었습니다. 이번 글에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 적용하며 경험한 내용을 중심으로 아래의 주제에 대해 자세히 소개하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker의 동작 원리\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\n## 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n\r\r\n### 서비스 장애 발생\r\r\n\r\r\n현대의 많은 서비스들은 API(application programming interface)나 RPC(remote procedure call)를 통해 데이터를 주고받습니다. 그런데 만약 특정 서비스가 응답하지 않는다면 어떤 일이 발생할까요? 호출한 서비스는 설정된 타임아웃 시간이 지날 때까지 응답을 기다리게 되고, 이로 인해 다른 서비스에도 **연쇄적인 영향을 미쳐 심각한 장애**로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_01_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j012408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 타임아웃이 왜 서비스 장애로 이어질까?\r\r\n\r\r\n애플리케이션은 작업을 처리하기 위해 스레드를 할당받아 실행합니다. 그러나 스레드 풀은 유한하기 때문에 동시에 처리할 수 있는 작업의 수에도 한계가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_02_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j022408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위 그림에서처럼 서비스 A와 관련된 요청이 증가하면서, 스레드 풀이 점점 더 많은 요청을 처리하게 되고, 결국 모든 스레드를 점유하게 됩니다. 이후 들어오는 요청들은 대기 큐에 쌓이게 되며, 대기 시간 동안 처리되지 못한 요청은 타임아웃이 발생합니다. 즉, 스레드 풀이 가득 찬 상태에서는 새로운 요청을 처리할 수 없어 서비스 장애가 발생하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Circuit Breaker로 문제 해결하기\r\r\n\r\r\n위와 같은 상황에서 Circuit Breaker를 도입하면 문제를 효과적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 서비스 호출의 실패율이 설정된 임곗값을 초과할 경우, 해당 서비스 호출을 즉시 차단하고 오류를 발생시킵니다. 이렇게 하면 A 서비스가 응답하지 않아 스레드 풀의 모든 스레드를 장시간 점유하는 상황을 방지할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 문제 발생 시 즉시 대응하여 시스템 전체에 미치는 영향을 줄이고, 장애가 전파되는 것을 방지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Resilience4j란?\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 소개에 앞서 Resilience4j가 무엇인지 간단하게 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j는 Netflix Hystrix로부터 영감을 받은 **함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)으로 설계된, 경량의 내결함성(fault tolerance) 라이브러리**입니다. Resilience4j는 Circuit Breaker 이외에 다른 핵심 모듈인 Bulkhead, RateLimiter, Retry, TimeLimiter, Cache을 제공하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 현재 Netflix Hystrix는 maintenance 모드이며, Resilience4j 사용을 권장하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker란?\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **CLOSED**, **OPEN** 및 **HALF\\_OPEN**의 세 가지 일반 상태와 **DISABLED** 및 **FORCED\\_OPEN**의 두 가지 특수 상태를 갖는 **유한 상태 머신**입니다.\r\r\n그리고 Circuit Breaker 동작을 이해하기 위해 필요한 `상태`와 `슬라이딩 윈도우`라는 2가지 주요 요소가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 상태(State)\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_03_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j032408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* 일반 상태\r\r\n    * CLOSED: 정상적으로 요청을 처리할 수 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * OPEN: 장애 상황으로 간주하여 이후 모든 요청에 대해 거부하는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * HALF\\_OPEN: 연동된 서비스의 장애 여부를 확인하기 위해 일시적으로 호출을 허용하는 상태이고 결과에 따라 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n* 특수 상태\r\r\n    * DISABLED: Circuit Breaker가 비활성화된 상태입니다. 즉, Circuit Breaker를 적용하지 않았을 때와 동일하게 동작합니다.\r\r\n    * FORCED\\_OPEN: 특정 조건에서 강제로 OPEN 상태로 변경되어 요청에 대해 처리할 수 없는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 슬라이딩 윈도우(Sliding Window)\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우는 시간 기반(Time-Based)과 개수 기반(Count-Based)의 2가지 타입을 갖습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Time-Based: **특정 기간(Duration)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n* Count-Based: **특정 개수(Count)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 동작\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **슬라이딩 윈도우 기반으로 호출(call) 결과를 기록 및 집계하고 그 결과에 따라 상태를 전환**합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기본적으로 CLOSED 상태로 시작되며, 연동된 서비스의 호출 결과를 `성공` 또는 `실패`로 기록합니다.\r\r\n이때, 실패로 기록된 호출 결과의 비율이 설정한 임계치를 초과하게 되면 연동된 서비스를 장애 상태로 판단하여 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이후 Circuit Breaker는 설정에 의해 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환될 수 있습니다. HALF\\_OPEN 상태에서는 일부 요청을 연동된 서비스로 호출하고 그 결과에 따라 CLOSED 또는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j Circuit Breaker의 각 설정 옵션에 대한 정확한 이해를 바탕으로 보다 명확하게 사용자의 의도에 맞게 설정할 수 있습니다. 공식 문서에 명시된 설명과 유의 사항을 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### failureRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < failureRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 50\r\r\nfailureRateThreshold(float failureRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallDurationThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nslowCallDurationThreshold(Duration slowCallDurationThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린 요청의 판단 기준을 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과를 받기까지의 시간이 설정한 값 이상으로 소요될 때 느린 요청으로 결과가 집계됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 호출 결과를 받기까지 소요된 시간을 기준으로 판단합니다. 실패했지만 느린 요청은 요청 횟수뿐 아니라 요청 실패 횟수도 증가합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_04_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j042408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuitBreakerStateMachine 클래스에는 내부적으로 AbstractAggregation을 상속 받은 TotalAggregation 객체를 가지고 있고, 이 객체에서 호출 결과에 따라 그 수를 각각 저장합니다. 위 화면에서 호출 결과가 SLOW\\_SUCCESS, SLOW\\_ERROR일 때 numberOfSlowCalls 카운트를 증가시키고 있습니다. 즉 **호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 느린 요청의 수를 증가**시킵니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < slowCallRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 100\r\r\nslowCallRateThreshold(float slowCallRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린(slow) 요청 비율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n느린 요청 비율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowType\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = COUNT_BASED\r\r\nslidingWindowType(SlidingWindowType slidingWindowType)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우 타입을 설정합니다.\r\r\nCOUNT\\_BASED와 TIME\\_BASED 2가지 타입이 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowSize\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nslidingWindowSize(int slidingWindowSize)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈를 설정합니다. 슬라이딩 윈도우 타입에 따라 설정한 값의 의미가 다릅니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* TIME\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 초(second) 단위이며, 600으로 설정할 경우 600초를 의미합니다.\r\r\n* COUNT\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 개수 단위이며, 100으로 설정할 경우 100개의 요청 수를 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nTime/Count Based 2가지 타입 모두 현재를 기준으로 합니다.\r\r\n즉, Time-Based는 최근 x초 동안의 호출을 기록하고, Count-Based는 최근 x개의 호출 수를 기록합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### minimumNumberOfCalls\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nminimumNumberOfCalls(int minimumNumberOfCalls)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위한 최소 호출 수에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Q. 만약 이 값이 없다면?\r\r\n> 최초 1개의 요청이 실패하면 즉시 실패율이 100%가 되어 Circuit Breaker 상태가 변경될 수 있습니다.\r\r\n> 따라서, 임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위해 최소한의 호출 수가 필요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **유의 사항**\r\r\n\r\r\n이 설정 값의 실제 동작에서의 역할과 유의 사항은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 최소 호출 수에 도달할 때까지 Circuit Breaker는 CLOSED 상태를 유지합니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우에도 이 설정 값은 시간이 아닌 `개수`입니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우 시간이 지나면서 이전 호출 결과가 슬라이딩 윈도우에 포함되지 않을 경우가 있습니다.\r\r\n    * 따라서 슬라이딩 윈도우에 기록 및 집계된 호출 결과의 수가 최소 요청 수를 만족할 때까지 상태를 전환하지 않습니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: 슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈가 30분일 때 14시 30분~15시까지 100개의 요청이 있고 15시부터 요청이 없다면, 15시 30분 기준에서는 단 하나의 요청도 없기 때문에 다시 최소 요청 수에 도달하기 전까지 임계치 초과 여부를 판단할 수 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState에 설정된 값과 minimumNumberOfCalls 값 중 최솟값을 사용**합니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=10, minimumNumberOfCalls=5일 경우, Circuit Breaker는 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 5개의 호출 결과에 대해 임계치를 계산하여 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 10\r\r\npermittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(int permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 허용 가능한 호출 수를 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> minimumNumberOfCalls 유의 사항 4번 참고\r\r\n\r\r\n### waitDurationInOpenState / waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nwaitDurationInOpenState(Duration waitDurationInOpenState)\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState(IntervalFunction waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환하기 위해 필요한 대기 시간을 설정합니다.\r\r\n이 설정 값만큼 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태를 유지해야 함을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState를 사용하면 interval function에 대해 커스터마이징이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 반드시 하나만 설정해야 하고, 모두 설정하면 오류가 발생합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nautomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled(boolean enableAutomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpen)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환 시 자동화 여부에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n만약 true로 설정되었다면, waitDurationInOpenState에서 설정한 시간이 지나면 자동으로 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default : minimumNumberOfCalls 값만큼 호출 후 OPEN 또는 CLOSED 상태로 전환될 때까지 HALF_OPEN 상태 유지 \r\r\nmaxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState(Duration maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 최대 몇 초 동안 유지될지에 대한 값을 설정합니다.\r\r\n설정된 시간이 지나면 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### writableStackTraceEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nwritableStackTraceEnabled(boolean writableStackTraceEnabled)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n오류 발생 시 stackTrace 출력 여부에 대한 설정 값입니다.\r\r\nfalse로 설정된다면 Exception.getStackTrace() 호출 시 길이가 0인 배열을 반환합니다.\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태일 때 받는 요청은 이미 CLOSED 상태에서 인지한 오류와 동일할 가능성이 크기 때문에 스팸성 로그를 줄이는 데 유용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordException\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordException(Predicate\\<Throwable> predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n실패로 기록될 오류를 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n조건문에 의해 true가 반환되면 해당 오류는 실패로 기록됩니다. 반대로 오류가 성공으로 간주되어야 하는 경우 false로 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> IgnoreExceptions, ignoreException에 의해 설정된 오류는 제외 가능\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordResult\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordResult(Predicate\\<Object> predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n응답 결과의 성공/실패에 대해 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n오류가 발생하지 않더라도 특정 응답 결과가 실패로 기록되어야 한다면 해당 조건문에 의해 true가 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### ignoreException\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nignoreException(Predicate<Throwable> predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n결과에 포함하지 않을 오류를 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n조건문에 의해 true가 반환되는 오류는 성공/실패로 기록되지 않으며 호출 내역에 집계되지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 예제\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 소개한 내용을 바탕으로 설정 값에 따라 Circuit Breaker가 어떻게 동작하는지 예제를 통해 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n예제를 소개하기 앞서, Circuit Breaker는 아래와 같이 설정되었다고 가정하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우: Count-Based, Size=10\r\r\n* 최소 호출 수: 6개\r\r\n* 실패 임계치: 50%\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1) Circuit Breaker 상태가 CLOSED 상태를 유지하는 경우: 현재 Circuit Breaker 상태 [CLOSED]\r\r\n\r\r\n#### Case 1-1) 최소 호출 수를 받지 않은

NHN Cloud에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 도입하여 시스템의 안정성을 높이고, 더 큰 장애 상황으로 이어질 수 있는 문제를 효과적으로 예방할 수 있었습니다. 이번 글에서는 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker를 적용하며 경험한 내용을 중심으로 아래의 주제에 대해 자세히 소개하고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker의 동작 원리\r\r\n* Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\n## 문제 상황: Circuit Breaker를 적용하게 된 배경\r\r\n\r\r\n### 서비스 장애 발생\r\r\n\r\r\n현대의 많은 서비스들은 API(application programming interface)나 RPC(remote procedure call)를 통해 데이터를 주고받습니다. 그런데 만약 특정 서비스가 응답하지 않는다면 어떤 일이 발생할까요? 호출한 서비스는 설정된 타임아웃 시간이 지날 때까지 응답을 기다리게 되고, 이로 인해 다른 서비스에도 **연쇄적인 영향을 미쳐 심각한 장애**로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_01_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j012408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 타임아웃이 왜 서비스 장애로 이어질까?\r\r\n\r\r\n애플리케이션은 작업을 처리하기 위해 스레드를 할당받아 실행합니다. 그러나 스레드 풀은 유한하기 때문에 동시에 처리할 수 있는 작업의 수에도 한계가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_02_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j022408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n위 그림에서처럼 서비스 A와 관련된 요청이 증가하면서, 스레드 풀이 점점 더 많은 요청을 처리하게 되고, 결국 모든 스레드를 점유하게 됩니다. 이후 들어오는 요청들은 대기 큐에 쌓이게 되며, 대기 시간 동안 처리되지 못한 요청은 타임아웃이 발생합니다. 즉, 스레드 풀이 가득 찬 상태에서는 새로운 요청을 처리할 수 없어 서비스 장애가 발생하게 됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Circuit Breaker로 문제 해결하기\r\r\n\r\r\n위와 같은 상황에서 Circuit Breaker를 도입하면 문제를 효과적으로 해결할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 서비스 호출의 실패율이 설정된 임곗값을 초과할 경우, 해당 서비스 호출을 즉시 차단하고 오류를 발생시킵니다. 이렇게 하면 A 서비스가 응답하지 않아 스레드 풀의 모든 스레드를 장시간 점유하는 상황을 방지할 수 있습니다. Circuit Breaker는 문제 발생 시 즉시 대응하여 시스템 전체에 미치는 영향을 줄이고, 장애가 전파되는 것을 방지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Resilience4j란?\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 Resilience4j Circuit Breaker 소개에 앞서 Resilience4j가 무엇인지 간단하게 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j는 Netflix Hystrix로부터 영감을 받은 **함수형 프로그래밍(functional programming)으로 설계된, 경량의 내결함성(fault tolerance) 라이브러리**입니다. Resilience4j는 Circuit Breaker 이외에 다른 핵심 모듈인 Bulkhead, RateLimiter, Retry, TimeLimiter, Cache을 제공하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 현재 Netflix Hystrix는 maintenance 모드이며, Resilience4j 사용을 권장하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker란?\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **CLOSED**, **OPEN** 및 **HALF\\_OPEN**의 세 가지 일반 상태와 **DISABLED** 및 **FORCED\\_OPEN**의 두 가지 특수 상태를 갖는 **유한 상태 머신**입니다.\r\r\n그리고 Circuit Breaker 동작을 이해하기 위해 필요한 `상태`와 `슬라이딩 윈도우`라는 2가지 주요 요소가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 상태(State)\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_03_2408_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j032408900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* 일반 상태\r\r\n    * CLOSED: 정상적으로 요청을 처리할 수 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * OPEN: 장애 상황으로 간주하여 이후 모든 요청에 대해 거부하는 상태입니다.\r\r\n    * HALF\\_OPEN: 연동된 서비스의 장애 여부를 확인하기 위해 일시적으로 호출을 허용하는 상태이고 결과에 따라 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n* 특수 상태\r\r\n    * DISABLED: Circuit Breaker가 비활성화된 상태입니다. 즉, Circuit Breaker를 적용하지 않았을 때와 동일하게 동작합니다.\r\r\n    * FORCED\\_OPEN: 특정 조건에서 강제로 OPEN 상태로 변경되어 요청에 대해 처리할 수 없는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 슬라이딩 윈도우(Sliding Window)\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우는 시간 기반(Time-Based)과 개수 기반(Count-Based)의 2가지 타입을 갖습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Time-Based: **특정 기간(Duration)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n* Count-Based: **특정 개수(Count)** 의 호출 결과를 저장하는 슬라이딩 윈도우를 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 동작\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker는 **슬라이딩 윈도우 기반으로 호출(call) 결과를 기록 및 집계하고 그 결과에 따라 상태를 전환**합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기본적으로 CLOSED 상태로 시작되며, 연동된 서비스의 호출 결과를 `성공` 또는 `실패`로 기록합니다.\r\r\n이때, 실패로 기록된 호출 결과의 비율이 설정한 임계치를 초과하게 되면 연동된 서비스를 장애 상태로 판단하여 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이후 Circuit Breaker는 설정에 의해 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환될 수 있습니다. HALF\\_OPEN 상태에서는 일부 요청을 연동된 서비스로 호출하고 그 결과에 따라 CLOSED 또는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Circuit Breaker 설정 옵션\r\r\n\r\r\nResilience4j Circuit Breaker의 각 설정 옵션에 대한 정확한 이해를 바탕으로 보다 명확하게 사용자의 의도에 맞게 설정할 수 있습니다. 공식 문서에 명시된 설명과 유의 사항을 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### failureRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < failureRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 50\r\r\nfailureRateThreshold(float failureRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과의 실패율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallDurationThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nslowCallDurationThreshold(Duration slowCallDurationThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린 요청의 판단 기준을 설정합니다.\r\r\n호출 결과를 받기까지의 시간이 설정한 값 이상으로 소요될 때 느린 요청으로 결과가 집계됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 호출 결과를 받기까지 소요된 시간을 기준으로 판단합니다. 실패했지만 느린 요청은 요청 횟수뿐 아니라 요청 실패 횟수도 증가합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![NHN Cloud_meetup diagram_Resilience4j_04_2408.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20diagramResilience4j042408.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuitBreakerStateMachine 클래스에는 내부적으로 AbstractAggregation을 상속 받은 TotalAggregation 객체를 가지고 있고, 이 객체에서 호출 결과에 따라 그 수를 각각 저장합니다. 위 화면에서 호출 결과가 SLOW\\_SUCCESS, SLOW\\_ERROR일 때 numberOfSlowCalls 카운트를 증가시키고 있습니다. 즉 **호출 성공 또는 실패 여부와 상관없이 느린 요청의 수를 증가**시킵니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slowCallRateThreshold\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// 0 < slowCallRateThreshold <= 100 범위 내 설정, Default = 100\r\r\nslowCallRateThreshold(float slowCallRateThreshold)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n느린(slow) 요청 비율(%)에 대한 임계치를 설정합니다.\r\r\n느린 요청 비율(%)이 설정한 임계치 이상일 때 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowType\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = COUNT_BASED\r\r\nslidingWindowType(SlidingWindowType slidingWindowType)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우 타입을 설정합니다.\r\r\nCOUNT\\_BASED와 TIME\\_BASED 2가지 타입이 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### slidingWindowSize\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nslidingWindowSize(int slidingWindowSize)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈를 설정합니다. 슬라이딩 윈도우 타입에 따라 설정한 값의 의미가 다릅니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* TIME\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 초(second) 단위이며, 600으로 설정할 경우 600초를 의미합니다.\r\r\n* COUNT\\_BASED: slidingWindowSize 값은 개수 단위이며, 100으로 설정할 경우 100개의 요청 수를 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nTime/Count Based 2가지 타입 모두 현재를 기준으로 합니다.\r\r\n즉, Time-Based는 최근 x초 동안의 호출을 기록하고, Count-Based는 최근 x개의 호출 수를 기록합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### minimumNumberOfCalls\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 100\r\r\nminimumNumberOfCalls(int minimumNumberOfCalls)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위한 최소 호출 수에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Q. 만약 이 값이 없다면?\r\r\n> 최초 1개의 요청이 실패하면 즉시 실패율이 100%가 되어 Circuit Breaker 상태가 변경될 수 있습니다.\r\r\n> 따라서, 임계치 초과 여부를 판단하기 위해 최소한의 호출 수가 필요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **유의 사항**\r\r\n\r\r\n이 설정 값의 실제 동작에서의 역할과 유의 사항은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 최소 호출 수에 도달할 때까지 Circuit Breaker는 CLOSED 상태를 유지합니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우에도 이 설정 값은 시간이 아닌 `개수`입니다.\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우가 시간 기반(Time-Based)일 경우 시간이 지나면서 이전 호출 결과가 슬라이딩 윈도우에 포함되지 않을 경우가 있습니다.\r\r\n    * 따라서 슬라이딩 윈도우에 기록 및 집계된 호출 결과의 수가 최소 요청 수를 만족할 때까지 상태를 전환하지 않습니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: 슬라이딩 윈도우의 사이즈가 30분일 때 14시 30분~15시까지 100개의 요청이 있고 15시부터 요청이 없다면, 15시 30분 기준에서는 단 하나의 요청도 없기 때문에 다시 최소 요청 수에 도달하기 전까지 임계치 초과 여부를 판단할 수 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 **permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState에 설정된 값과 minimumNumberOfCalls 값 중 최솟값을 사용**합니다.\r\r\n\t* 예: permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=10, minimumNumberOfCalls=5일 경우, Circuit Breaker는 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 5개의 호출 결과에 대해 임계치를 계산하여 상태를 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 10\r\r\npermittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState(int permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태일 때 허용 가능한 호출 수를 설정합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> minimumNumberOfCalls 유의 사항 4번 참고\r\r\n\r\r\n### waitDurationInOpenState / waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = 60s(초)\r\r\nwaitDurationInOpenState(Duration waitDurationInOpenState)\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState(IntervalFunction waitIntervalFunctionInOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환하기 위해 필요한 대기 시간을 설정합니다.\r\r\n이 설정 값만큼 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태를 유지해야 함을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nwaitIntervalFunctionInOpenState를 사용하면 interval function에 대해 커스터마이징이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 반드시 하나만 설정해야 하고, 모두 설정하면 오류가 발생합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nautomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled(boolean enableAutomaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpen)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환 시 자동화 여부에 대해 설정합니다.\r\r\n만약 true로 설정되었다면, waitDurationInOpenState에서 설정한 시간이 지나면 자동으로 OPEN 상태에서 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default : minimumNumberOfCalls 값만큼 호출 후 OPEN 또는 CLOSED 상태로 전환될 때까지 HALF_OPEN 상태 유지 \r\r\nmaxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState(Duration maxWaitDurationInHalfOpenState)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 HALF\\_OPEN 상태로 최대 몇 초 동안 유지될지에 대한 값을 설정합니다.\r\r\n설정된 시간이 지나면 Circuit Breaker는 OPEN 상태로 전환합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### writableStackTraceEnabled\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\n// Default = false\r\r\nwritableStackTraceEnabled(boolean writableStackTraceEnabled)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n오류 발생 시 stackTrace 출력 여부에 대한 설정 값입니다.\r\r\nfalse로 설정된다면 Exception.getStackTrace() 호출 시 길이가 0인 배열을 반환합니다.\r\r\nCircuit Breaker가 OPEN 상태일 때 받는 요청은 이미 CLOSED 상태에서 인지한 오류와 동일할 가능성이 크기 때문에 스팸성 로그를 줄이는 데 유용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordException\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordException(Predicate\\ predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n실패로 기록될 오류를 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n조건문에 의해 true가 반환되면 해당 오류는 실패로 기록됩니다. 반대로 오류가 성공으로 간주되어야 하는 경우 false로 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> IgnoreExceptions, ignoreException에 의해 설정된 오류는 제외 가능\r\r\n\r\r\n### recordResult\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nrecordResult(Predicate\\ predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n응답 결과의 성공/실패에 대해 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n오류가 발생하지 않더라도 특정 응답 결과가 실패로 기록되어야 한다면 해당 조건문에 의해 true가 반환되어야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### ignoreException\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\nignoreException(Predicate predicate)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n결과에 포함하지 않을 오류를 판단하는 조건문을 설정합니다.\r\r\n조건문에 의해 true가 반환되는 오류는 성공/실패로 기록되지 않으며 호출 내역에 집계되지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 예제\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 소개한 내용을 바탕으로 설정 값에 따라 Circuit Breaker가 어떻게 동작하는지 예제를 통해 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n예제를 소개하기 앞서, Circuit Breaker는 아래와 같이 설정되었다고 가정하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 슬라이딩 윈도우: Count-Based,

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이전 글 part 1에서 못 담았던 자신감 관련 이야기를 조금 더 해보고 싶다. 우리가 시작했던 LA 시장에서도 이런 창업가와 VC들의 자신감이 크게 상승했던 큰 이벤트가 있었는데, 바로 Snap(구 Snapchat)의 IPO였다.\n스냅챗은 아주 LA스러운 창업가 Evan Spiegel에 LA의 Venice Beach에서 창업했고, 2017년 3월 2일에 IPO를 했다. 최근 시가총액은 20조 원을 왔다 갔다 하고 있어서 IPO 당시 시총보단 한참 작지만, 높을 땐 40조 원이 넘는, 디즈니와 Amgen에 이어 LA 지역에서 세 번째로 시총이 높은 회사였다. 스냅의 IPO가 LA의 스타트업 생태계에 미친 영향은 엄청났는데, 가장 큰 건 이전 포스팅에서 내가 강조한 ‘자신감’이다. 당시에 LA는 전 세계에서 가장 빠르게 성장하고 있는 벤처생태계 중 하나였고, 그동안 많은 좋은 스타트업이 창업되고 엑싯도 잘했다. 그런데 이 엑싯들을 보면 대부분 수백억 원에서 수천억 원 대의 M&A였고, 아주 가끔은 조 단위의 엑싯도 LA 지역에서 일어나기도 했다. 스냅 IPO 이전에는 대부분의 LA 창업가들은 적당히 회사를 키운 후에 수백억 ~ 수천억 원 규모에 더 큰 회사에 파는 엑싯 전략을 기반으로 사업을 했고, 그 이유는 그 정도의 자신감밖에 없었기 때문이기도 하다.\n하지만, 26살의 젊은 창업가 Evan이 스냅챗을 수십조 원짜리 회사로 상장시켰을 때, LA 지역의 창업가들은 이 IPO로 인해 굉장한 자신감을 갖게 됐다. LA에서 수천억 원 ~ 수조 원의 엑싯은 심심찮게 나왔지만, 수십조 원의 IPO도 가능하다는 걸 스냅이 입증해 줬기 때문에, 더 많은 창업가가 “나도 굳이 실리콘밸리나 다른 곳으로 가지 않아도, 내가 사랑하는 따뜻한 LA에서 잘만 하면 수십조 원짜리 회사를 만들어서 상장시킬 수 있다.”라는 생각을 하면서 엄청난 자신감을 갖게 됐다. 스냅의 IPO 이후엔 더 많은 LA의 창업가가 더 큰 꿈과 비전을 갖고, 이왕 시작한 회사를 가능하면 대형 IPO가 가능한 규모로 키울 생각을 하게 됐는데, 나는 이게 엄청난 긍정적 자신감의 변화라고 생각한다.\n스냅의 성공적인 IPO로 인해서 다양한 변화가 생기기 시작했는데, 가장 눈에 띄는 변화 몇 가지에 대해서 적어보고 싶다. 일단 LA의 북동쪽에 위치한 캘리포니아공대(Caltech) 학생들의 창업이 활발해지기 시작했다. 나는 개인적으로 칼텍 학생들이 전반적으로 MIT나 스탠포드 보다 더 똑똑하다고 생각하는데(smart이기도 하지만, 훨씬 더 geeky하고 nerdy 하다), 이들은 전통적으로 창업보다는 연구에 관심이 많았다. 이 학교 졸업생들은 대부분 석사/박사 과정까지 하고, 이후에는 교수, 또는 NASA나 JPL(제트추진연구소)에 취직해서 인류가 직면한 가장 어려운 문제에 대한 솔루션을 찾는 커리어를 선호한다. 하지만, 스냅 IPO 이후에는 칼텍 학생들도 창업에 관심을 갖게 됐고, 이렇게 좋은 창업가들이 뭔가를 시작한다는 건 LA의 창업 생태계에는 엄청난 긍정적인 변화와 자신감을 가져오는 계기가 됐다.\n또한, 스냅의 IPO로 인해, 굉장히 많은 부자들이 탄생했다. 스냅에 투자한 투자자들이 이 IPO로 번 돈은 엄청났고, 이들은 LA 생태계에 계속 돈을 투입하면 더 많은 성공적인 회사들이 나올 것이고, 더 많은 돈을 벌 수 있다는 확고한 자신감이 생겼다. 또한, 이들에게 자금을 제공해 주는 LP 들도 LA의 스타트업 생태계에 대한 신념이 생기면서 계속 대규모 자본이 LA 스타트업에 투입되는 선순환 사이클이 만들어졌다.\n스냅의 많은 직원들도 이 IPO로 인해서 백만장자가 됐다. 이들은 성공적인 회사를 만들었고, 돈도 벌면서 새로운 레벨의 자신감을 경험하기 시작했다. 이들은 다른 스타트업에 개인 투자를 하거나, 후배 양성을 위한 액셀러레이터나 VC 펀드를 설립해서 본인이 사업하면서 남들한테 받았던 도움을 다시 pay it forward 하기 시작했다. 이런 사이클이 몇 번 반복되면서 LA도 실리콘밸리와 같은 두터운 창업가와 투자자의 인프라가 형성되기 시작했다. 내가 말하는 자신감이 여기저기서 생기기 시작한 것이다. 스냅의 IPO로 큰돈을 못 번 직원들도 작은 회사가 초고속 성장해서 IPO까지 가는 걸 경험했기 때문에, 이러한 경험, 배움, 그리고 자신감을 다른 스타트업으로 그대로 가져가서 스냅과 같은 성공 케이스를 계속 만들기 시작하면서, LA 스타트업 생태계의 자신감이 폭발하기 시작했다. \n나는 이런 현상이 한국에서도 이제 막 일어나고 있다고 생각한다. 그래서 많은 스타트업 분들이 기대하고 있는 토스의 IPO가 초대박이 나길 바라고 있고 마켓컬리 같은 회사도 아주 잘 되길 바란다. 참고로, 우린 토스나 마켓컬리 투자자는 아니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새 나는 한국보단 해외 투자자들을 훨씬 더 많이 만나서 이들에게 돈을 받기 위해 노력하고 있다. 남에게 돈 받는 건 항상 어려운 일이고, 특히나 요새 같이 이자율이 높고 경제 상황이 좋지 않은 불경기엔 펀딩이 더욱더 힘들어 진다.(VC들의 펀딩이 이렇게 어렵다 보니, 우리 같은 VC에게 투자받아야 하는 창업가들의 펀딩은 더 어렵고 시간이 오래 걸릴 수밖에 없다).\n하지만, 몇 년 전과 비교해 보면 좋아진 점도 있는데, 그건 바로 한국이라는 나라의 이미지와 한국의 벤처 시장이 과거와는 비교할 수 없을 정도로 좋아졌다는 것이다. 전에는 잠재 LP들에게 왜 스트롱 같이 한국에 투자하는 VC에 출자해야 하는지 설명하는 데만 상당히 많은 시간을 할애했고, 이 설명의 기간이 어떤 경우엔 수년이 걸렸다. 하지만, 이젠 대부분의 투자자들이 한국이라는 시장에 대한 의문이나 의심은 없을 정도로 한국의 벤처생태계가 그동안 많은 발전을 했다.\n내가 잠재 LP들에게 최근에 가장 많이 받은 질문은 어떻게 이렇게 상대적으로 짧은 기간 안에 한국의 스타트업 시장이 좋아졌냐인데, 이 질문에 대한 짧은 답변은 아주 간단하게 그냥 한국 창업가들의 수준이 매우 높아졌다는 것이다. 그럼, 왜 한국 창업가들의 수준이 이렇게 좋아졌을까? 여기에 대한 여러 가지 이론, 생각, 그리고 각자의 경험이 있지만, 내가 딱 한 가지만 강조하자면, 그건 ‘자신감’이라고 생각한다.\n창업가의 자신감은 정말 중요하다. 내가 하는 사업에 대한 확신과 자신감, 내가 만들고 있는 제품에 대한 자신감, 그리고 나 스스로에 대한 자신감은 안 되는 사업도 되게 하고, 못 받던 펀딩도 받게 한다. 평소에 잘 안되던 것들이 자신감과 이로 인한 파급 효과로 인해서 하나씩 만들어지는 걸 경험하는 순간, 잠재의식 속에서는 더 큰 자신감이 무의식적으로 생기고, 이건 결국엔 성공의 확률을 높일 수밖에 없다. 창업가들이 이렇게 자신감으로 무장되면, 기업가치 300억 원의 회사를 만들겠다던 목표가 1,000억 원이 된다. 그리고 이 목표가 계속 커져서 결국엔 10조 원짜리 데카콘까지 바라볼 수 있게 만드는 게 창업가의 자신감이다.\n비공식적인 기록이지만, 한국에는 유니콘 기업이 22개나 있다. 작은 나라치곤 엄청나게 많은 유니콘이다. 이런 사실도 한국 창업가들에겐 큰 자신감을 준다. 이렇게 작은 나라에서 기업가치가 1조 원 이상인 비상장 회사가 이렇게 많다는 점, 이 중 몇 개의 기업은 본인이 개인적으로 아는 창업가들이 만들었는데, 그들도 그냥 나랑 비슷한 평범한 사람이라는 점, 그래서 어쩌면, 그리고 언젠가는 나도 수천억 원의 펀딩을 받고 유니콘 기업을 만들 수 있다는 생각만으로도 이 창업가의 자신감은 하늘을 찌를 수 있다.\n쿠팡의 뉴욕증권거래소 상장은 한국 창업가들의 마음에 큰불을 질렀다. 한국 시장만을 상대로 이커머스 사업을 하는 회사가 미국에서 IPO를 했고, 지금은 좀 내려갔지만, 한때는 기업가치가 100조 원에 육박했다는 사실은 한국 창업가들에게 엄청난 자신감을 준 큰 사건이었다. 그동안 항상 한국 시장이 작고, 한국 기업이 미국에서 상장하는 건 불가능하다는 부정적인 이야기만 들었고, 한국인들도 항상 곧 망할 거라고 확신했던 쿠팡이라는 회사를, 김범석이라는 창업가가 이런 비관론자들에게 마치 fuck you를 날리듯 보기 좋게 성공시켰다.\n배달의민족 엑싯도 한국 창업가들에게 큰 자신감을 줬다. 국내에서 학교를 다녔고, 국내에서만 일 한 경험이 있는 순수 토종 창업가 김봉진 대표가 만든 한국의 스타트업이 수조 원의 기업가치에 외국 회사에 인수됐을 때, 많은 한국의 창업가들이 “아, 유니콘은 외국에서 공부한 엄친아들만 만들 수 있는 줄 알았는데, 그게 아니구나. 나도 더 열심히 하면 배달의민족보다 훨씬 더 큰 회사를 만들 수도 있겠다.”와 비슷한 생각을 하면서 할 수 있다는 아주 큰 자신감이 생겼을 것이다.\n그리고 이 자신감은 창업가들에게만 해당하는 건 아니다. 이들에게 투자했던 VC들에도 해당한다. 스타트업에 투자해서 큰돈을 버는 건 외국 VC에만 해당하는 먼 나라 이야기라고 생각했던 국내 VC들도 투자한 회사들이 유니콘이 되고, 이들이 엑싯했을 때 엄청나게 큰돈을 벌면서, 앞으로 더욱더 많은 유니콘 회사를 발굴해서 투자할 수 있다는 자신감이 생겼다. 이 자신감으로 이들은 더 큰 펀드를 만들고, 더 큰 펀드로 더 많은 좋은 회사에 투자하고 있다.\n이런 자신감들이 처음에는 작게 생기다가, 시간이 지나면서 여기저기서 생기고, 이게 계속 쌓이면서 어느 순간 폭발적으로 커지는데, 이럴 때 대단한 일들이 벌어진다.\n지금이 바로 한국 스타트업 생태계에서 이런 일들이 일어나고 있다고 나는 생각하고, 앞으로 한국의 스타트업 시장은 더욱더 좋아질 거라고 확신한다.\nPart 2에서도 자신감 관련 이야기를 조금 더 해보고 싶다.",

5단계\n.css-14on8x8{font-size:17px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:normal;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);margin:24px 0 8px;}\n이사할 때 인테리어를 고치는 사람이 늘어나고 있다. 지어진 지 10년 이상 된 집에 입주할 때뿐 아니라 새 아파트 입주 시에도 인테리어를 취향껏 하고 싶어서 ‘마이너스 옵션(아파트 분양에 있어서, 벽지, 바닥재 등 마감재 품목의 설치 여부를 입주자가 선택하게 하는 것)’을 이용하거나 기본 인테리어를 뜯어내고 다시 할 정도다.\n잡지에 소개된 집처럼 세련되고 개성 있게 고치고 싶지만, 대부분 인테리어에 대한 경험과 지식이 부족하고 예산이 한정되어 있어 공사 시작 전부터 막막하다. 그래서 초보자도 큰 실수 없이 인테리어를 할 수 있는 방법을 5단계로 정리해 보았다.\n1단계. 공사 범위 및 예산 정하기\n무작정 업체부터 방문해서 인테리어 상담을 받기보다는, .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}나중에 수정하더라도 .css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}‘어느 부분을 어떻게 고칠 것인지’를 미리 계획하고 방문하는 것이 좋다. ‘전체 수리’를 할지 아니면 ‘부분 수리’를 할지 결정한 다음, 원하는 스타일을 생각해보는 것이다.\n먼저 수리할 부분을 항목별로 나눠 리스트를 작성한다. 리스트에는 자신이 생각하는 콘셉트 및 총 예산을 쓰고 나서 항목별 원하는 스타일이나 예상하는 예산을 적는다. 인테리어를 진행하다 보면 처음에 계획한 것보다 비용이 초과되는 경우가 많기 때문에 공사 범위, 콘셉트 및 예산 계획을 미리 세우는 것이 중요하다.\n2단계. 견적받기\n적어도 세 곳 이상의 다른 업체에서 견적을 받아 가격을 비교해 봐야 감을 잡을 수 있다. 다섯 곳이 넘어가면 중복되는 내용이 많고 오히려 결정을 늦출 수 있어 일반적으로 서너 곳 정도에서 받아보는 것이 무난하다.\n견적을 받을 때는 반드시 실제 공사할 현장에 방문해서 실측이 이루어져야 한다. 간혹 해당 아파트 단지 공사 경험이 많다는 이유 등으로 현장 방문을 생략하고 견적을 내려는 업체가 있는데, 이런 업체는 과감하게 패스하는 것이 좋다. 아무리 같은 단지, 같은 구조의 아파트라 하더라도 각각의 집마다 공사 여건과 환경 등이 달라질 수 있기 때문이다. 가격은 유독 저렴한 업체와 비싼 업체는 피하고 중간 정도의 가격대를 꼼꼼히 확인해서 내주는 업체로 하는 것이 좋다.\n3단계. 인테리어 업체 선정하기\n인테리어 업체는 믿을 만한지(공사 경험과 A/S), 의뢰인의 의견을 잘 반영해 주는지 등을 중점적으로 살펴본다. 계약서를 작성하기 전에 지역 맘카페에 글을 올려 해당 인테리어 업체에 대한 평판과 반응, 공사 후기 등을 댓글로 살펴보는 것도 좋다. 단, 인테리어 업체에 대한 질문을 올릴 때에는 상호명을 직접적으로 노출하는 것은 피해야 한다. 의도치 않게 업체에 대한 악플이 달려 민원을 받을 수도 있기 때문이다. 구체적인 동네와 초성 처리한 상호 정도로 올려도 같은 지역 사람들은 어느 업체인지 다 알기 때문에 조언의 댓글을 받을 수 있다.\n또한 업체의 대표가 실제 공사에 어느 정도 관여하는지도 중요하다. 일부 업체에서는 견적 및 전체적인 일정만 관리하고 모든 공사와 감독을 하청업체에 맡기기도 한다. 물론 인테리어 업체의 대표가 모든 공정의 기술자가 아니기 때문에 항목별로 하청을 주는 것은 당연하다. 하지만 현장은 늘 대표나 담당직원이 직접 관리·감독하면서 부분적이라도 공사에 직접 참여하고 있어야 한다. 대표가 현장을 관리·감독하는 업체일수록 공사의 만족도도 높고 A/S도 빠른 편이다.\n4단계. 계약서 작성하기\n계약서를 작성할 때는 각 항목별 ‘세부 내역서’도 포함되어 있어야 한다. 전체 공사금액뿐만 아니라 각 항목별 세부금액과 어떠한 자재로 시공되는지 기재해야 한다.\n가끔 ‘싱크대 상급으로 시공’, ‘전등 LED로 시공’ 등과 같이 두루뭉술하게 내역서를 작성하기도 한다. 고객이 생각한 수준 이상으로 시공이 되는 경우도 있지만 반대로 그 이하의 제품으로 시공이 될 수도 있기 때문에 분쟁의 소지가 다분하다. 그러므로 반드시 계약서 작성 시, 공사 항목별로 세분화하여 꼼꼼하게 작성한 내역서가 첨부되어야 한다.\n예를 들어 ‘욕실공사’라는 항목이 있을 때 단순히 ‘욕실 전체 공사 450만 원’이라고 적으면 안 된다. ‘바닥방수재 시공 60만 원, 타일 시공(벽면 250×400, 바닥 200×200) 190만 원, 변기(대림,모델 No.OO) 40만 원…, 합계 450만 원’과 같이 세부적으로 항목별 금액과 제품의 사이즈 또는 모델 번호까지 기재해야 한다.\n또한 공사 기간, A/S 기간 및 범위, 추가 비용 등의 내용이 반드시 포함되어야 한다. 특히 추가 비용에는 공사 현장 여건상 불가피하게 추가로 발생하는 경우와 의뢰인의 요구사항이나 변경사항으로 인해 추가로 발생하는 경우를 나누어 상황별로 어떻게 비용을 처리할지를 명확하게 기재하는 것이 좋다. 세부 내역서를 포함한 계약서는 2부 작성하여 각각 1부씩 보관하고 있어야 한다.\n계약서를 작성할 때는 너무하다는 생각이 들 정도로 꼼꼼하게 작성하는 것이 좋다. 분쟁의 소지가 그만큼 줄어들기 때문이다.\n✅.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}’인테리어 계약서 잘 쓰는 법' 자세히 보기\n\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0

초반 기준이며, 인테리어 공사비 또한 물가 상승과 함께 오르고 있다는 점도 감안하자.\n5단계. 비용 지급하기\n일반적으로 전체 공사비의 10~20% 정도의 계약금을 계약서 작성 시 지급한다. 중도금은 한 번에 50~60%를 지급하는 경우가 있고, 1차와 2차로 나누어 지급하는 경우도 있다. 한 번에 낼 때는 대개 철거공사가 완료되고 본격적으로 인테리어 공사가 진행될 때 지급한다. 중도금을 나누어 낼 때는 철거공사가 시작될 때와 공사 공정이 중간을 넘기는 시점에 지급하는 경우가 많다.\n잔금 20~30%는 최종적으로 모든 공사가 완료되고 의뢰인이 현장을 점검한 뒤 이상이 없을 경우 지급하면 된다. 의뢰인의 입장에서는 공사가 완료되었다고 해서 바로 잔금을 지급하기보다는 3~4일 정도 후에 지급하는 것이 좋다. 눈에 바로 보이는 하자도 있지만, 실제 사용했을 때 나타나는 하자도 있기 때문이다. 그러므로 며칠 생활을 해보면서 점검 및 확인을 꼼꼼하게 한 후에 잔금을 지급하도록 한다.\n인테리어 공사의 일반적인 진행 순서\n① 공사 준비\n공사가 시작되기 1~2주 전에 아파트 관리사무소에 방문해서 공사의 범위 및 일정을 알린다. 대부분의 관리사무소에서는 해당 동의 같은 라인(혹은 동 전체)에 살고 있는 입주민 2/3 이상의 공사동의서를 받아올 것을 요구한다. (공사동의서와 공사안내문은 대부분 인테리어 업체에서 알아서 진행해준다.) 아파트라면 단지별로 정해진 엘리베이터 사용료도 확인해야 한다.\n② 공사 시작\n본격적인 공사를 시작하기 3~4일 전 엘리베이터, 건물 출입구 등에 공사안내문을 게시한다. 공사안내문에는 공사기간 및 공사의 범위 등을 기재한다. 공사로 인해 소음이 가장 심하게 발생하는 날(욕실, 바닥 타일 등의 철거, 발코니 확장 등)이 언제인지 함께 기재하는 것이 좋다.\n③ 철거 공사\n싱크대와 몰딩 철거는 크게 소음이 나지 않지만, 욕실 타일 철거와 발코니 확장으로 인한 철거 작업 시에는 소음과 먼지가 많이 발생한다. 주변 입주민에게 민원이 들어올 수도 있기 때문에 너무 이른 시간과 늦은 오후 시간에 작업하는 것은 피한다.\n④ 전기 및 설비 공사\n싱크대의 구조를 변경하거나 욕실 배관 등을 교체할 때는 설비 공사가 필요하다. 거실이나 방 발코니를 확장하는 경우, 확장되는 부분 바닥에 보일러 배관 설치가 진행된다.\n⑤ 새시 및 문틀 교체\n발코니 확장 또는 새시 교체, 내부 문(문틀) 교체가 있을 경우, 기존의 틀을 철거 한 후 새로운 틀로 교체한다. 이때 공사의 원활한 진행을 위해 틀만 먼저 설치하고 문(창문)은 공사가 어느 정도 진행된 후에 설치하게 된다.\n⑥ 목공사\n목공사는 목재를 써서 하는 모든 공사를 일컫는 용어다. 인테리어 현장에서 천장 작업, 몰딩 작업, 거실 아트월, 중문 설치 시 가벽 작업 등이 목공사로 진행된다. 이 단계에서 천장에 설치되는 전등의 위치가 최종적으로 정해지기 때문에 자신이 원하는 위치가 있다면 사전에 공사 관계자에게 정확한 위치를 알려주는 것이 좋다. 발코니 확장을 위한 벽면 단열재 공사도 대부분 이때 함께 진행된다.\n⑦ 타일 공사\n인테리어 공사에서 의외로 타일 공사가 차지하는 비중이 크다. 현관 바닥, 싱크대 벽면, 발코니 바닥, 욕실(벽면, 바닥) 등을 동시에 진행하는 경우가 많다. 타일 공사 양이 많을 경우에는 욕실만 따로 작업하기도 한다.\n⑧ 필름지 공사 및 페인트 작업\n필름지(일명 시트지) 공사는 기존의 문이나 가구 등의 표면에 새로운 필름지를 입히는 작업으로 일종의 리폼이라고 생각하면 된다. 예전에는 문, 문틀 등에 페인트칠을 하는 경우가 많았는데, 최근에는 대부분 필름지 작업을 한다.\n필름지의 장점은 작업 후에 냄새가 없고, 색상이 다양하고 면처리가 깔끔해서 리폼의 완성도를 높일 수 있다는 것이다. 단점은 페인트에 비해 가격이 비싸다는 것이다. 최근 페인트 작업은 발코니와 창고 벽면에만 하는 추세다.\n⑨ 도배 및 바닥 공사\n도배와 바닥 시공은 가구가 설치되기 전에 해야 일의 진행속도가 빠르고 편하다. 하지만 가구 공사를 먼저 하는 경우도 있다. 싱크대 같은 가구를 먼저 설치하고 도배해야 가구와 벽면 또는 천장 사이의 이음새 부분을 도배지로 자연스럽게 덮어 가릴 수 있어 마감처리면에서 효과적이기 때문이다.\n반대로 도배를 먼저 한 후 가구를 설치하게 되면 이음새 부분에 미세하게 틈이 생긴다. 미세한 틈을 투명 실리콘으로 마감해도 상관은 없지만 섬세한 작업 결과를 원한다면 가구 설치를 먼저 한 후에 도배 및 바닥공사를 시공하는 것이 좋다.\n참고로 도배 대신 페인트로 시공하려는 경우가 있다. 페인트는 도배지에 비해 색상을 다양하게 연출할 수 있고 비용이 저렴하다는 장점이 있지만, 벽면이 고르지 않을 경우 퍼팅 작업이 병행되어야 하므로 오히려 비용이 추가될 수 있다.\n⑩ 가구 공사\n싱크대, 붙박이장, 신발장 등이 시공된다. 대부분 사전에 디자인과 사이즈 측량이 완료되어 제작된 완성품이 배송되기 때문에 설치만 하면 된다.\n⑪ 전등 및 전기콘센트 커버 교체\n전등과 콘센트 커버는 외관상 노출되는 효과가 크다. 특히 거실과 주방(식탁) 전등의 경우 디자인이나 색상에 따라 집 안의 전체적인 분위기가 달라질 수 있다. 그러므로 업체에서 임의로 설치해주기 전에 본인의 취향에 맞는 디자인을 직접 선택하는 것이 좋다.\n⑫ 액세서리 설치\n발코니 천장의 빨래건조대, 문 손잡이(실린더), 욕실 액세서리(선반, 휴지걸이, 수건걸이 등), 방충망 등을 설치하면서 공사 관계자가 모든 일정을 마무리한다. 이때 커튼 설치를 위한 커튼봉 시공, 액자를 걸기 위한 못질, 인테리어 선반 설치 등등이 필요할 경우 부탁하면 거의 대부분 서비스로 해준다.\n⑬ 입주 청소\n찌든 때는 없지만 먼지가 많기 때문에 입주 청소를 해야 한다. 닦기를 수차례 반복해도 계속해서 먼지가 나오고 생각보다 청소가 쉽지 않다. 그러므로 비용이 들더라도 웬만하면 청소 전문가에게 입주 청소를 맡기는 것이 효율적이다.\n매일 현장에 방문해서 진행사항 체크하는 건 필수\n공사가 진행되는 기간 동안 바쁘더라도 매일 현장에 방문해보는 것이 좋다. 의뢰인이 현장에 자주 방문하면 일하는 사람들이 부담스러워할 수도 있기 때문에 아무도 없는 저녁시간에 방문하는 것을 추천한다. 그날그날 진행사항들을 체크하면서 계약 내용과 다르게 시공된 것이 있거나 수정 또는 보완 사항이 있을 경우 업체대표(또는 현장담당자)에게 바로 이야기하는 것이 좋다. 나중에는 공사 순서와 일정 또는 물리적인 상황 때문에 수정사항을 반영해주지 못하는 경우도 있기 때문에 미루지 말고 그때그때 바로 말하고 의견을 조율하는 것이 좋다.\n세금계산서(또는 부가세 영수증)를 발급받아야 할까?\n인테리어(집 수리)를 할 때 규모가 크지 않은 동네 업체에게 견적을 받을 때 부가세 10%를 내고 영수증을 발급받을지, 아니면 영수증을 발급받지 않고 부가세 10%를 절약할지 선택하라고 할 때가 있다.\n나중에 해당 주택을 매도할 때 양도소득세가 비과세라면 굳이 부가세를 끊을 필요가 없다. 그러나 다주택자이거나 혹은 향후 양도가액이 12억 원 초과로 양도소득세 부과가 예상될 경우 부가세 10%를 지급하고 영수증을 발급받아 놓는 것이 좋다.\n양도소득세 계산 시 필요경비로 공사비를 인정받을 수 있어서 절세를 할 수 있기 때문이다. 단, 부가세 영수증을 발급받을 때는 품목을 양도소득세에서 필요경비로 인정받을 수 있는 공사품목으로 발급받아야 한다.\n\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 윤여진",
