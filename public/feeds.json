        "content:encodedSnippet": "Another year and another CppCon is all wrapped up! Microsoft was pleased to once again be an exhibitor and to have several of our employees present sessions at the conference. Here are my major takeaways from the keynotes, sessions, conversations, and the general vibe.\nAI tooling is finding a footing with the C++ community. The next year is going to see the reliability and usefulness of those tools jump drastically.\nVisual Studio users consistently name the debugger as one of the best features of the product.\nLots of folks are getting excited about the static reflection capabilities in C++26.\nThe week before CppCon, we announced Visual Studio 2026 and Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50, and the conference gave us a great opportunity to let you know what you can expect in the new release and for you to give us your feedback. We highly encourage you to try out the Insiders release and let us know what your experience is like.\nThis is a long post, so here’s a table of contents to help you navigate if you are only interested in specific parts:\nThe Microsoft Booth\nKeynotes\nMicrosoft Sessions\nOther Sessions of Interest\nWrapping It Up\nNow, let’s get into some of the details from the conference.\nThe Microsoft Booth\n     \n \nConference attendees often describe the “hallway track” as a hidden gem of in-person attendance, and as a tool vendor, the exhibition hall serves a similar function: providing a way to broadly understand what the community and our users are looking for from our products. We really do value your feedback, and we appreciate everyone who came by to talk to us or to fill out our feedback survey. We even managed to get in a couple of deeper, private, in-person conversations with users to really dig into what they want from their tools.\nSurvey\nThe survey we conducted ended up with over 170 unique entries, and from those entries, we randomly selected raffle winners for some great LEGO® prizes. Congratulations to the winner!\n        \n\nKeynotes\nConcept-Based Generic Programming – Bjarne Stroustrup\n\nBjarne’s keynote on generic programming with C++ concepts was focused on showing how concepts, which were added in C++20, are one tool in the toolbox for writing code that can reinforce safety and encapsulate differences between types so that code can be written in a way that it doesn’t have to repeatedly handle all the special cases.\nI was particularly fond of the idea of using values as concept parameters to encode into the type system certain expectations about a type, such as maximum object size, which is important in many serialization, caching, and performance optimization scenarios. It’s a much better solution than my existing preference of using static_assert to check object size directly after the type declaration.\nCrafting The Code You Don’t Write: Sculpting Software in an AI World – Daisy Hollman\n\nI didn’t get a chance to see Daisy’s talk live at the conference, but I caught it on the CppCon Video Archive afterwards. Daisy gives a great talk as usual, balancing sharp technical insight and examples that make them relevant to the viewers’ everyday problems. In this case, it was about understanding LLMs and how they work so that you might understand why they give the sorts of completions that they give based on your prompt. Ultimately, they respond to our prompts and the context we provide, and each model will respond differently.\nOne of my favorite things from the talk was the idea that you should think of LLM-based AI assistants “like junior engineers who have read the whole internet.” This is very similar to my description from my Meeting C++ 2023 talk AI Assistants for C++ Developers “as a very eager, over-confident beginner with access to an enormous library and the skills to quickly find and collate information.” Of course, Daisy puts it much more succinctly.\nReflection: C++’s Decade-Defining Rocket Engine – Herb Sutter\n\nI haven’t gotten around to watching Herb’s talk, but I’m looking forward to it soon. Let us know in the comments what you think about it if you were there or after you’ve watched it on YouTube!\nMore Speed & Simplicity: Practical Data-Oriented Design in C++ – Vittorio Romeo\n\nLike with Herb’s talk, I haven’t gotten a chance to watch Vittorio’s keynote. I’m a pretty big fan of data-oriented design so I’m interested in what Vittorio has to say about it. Let us know what you think of his talk in the comments!\nC++: Some Assembly Required – Matt Godbolt\n\nMatt’s closing keynote session was wide-ranging and quite good, as usual. He walked through the different dictionary definitions of assembly and how they applied to C++ and the C++ community, often in surprisingly meaningful ways. Of course, he’s most well known for Compiler Explorer, which lets you view the generated binary code for your C++ code in a variety of assembly language syntaxes. There was content on technical topics like that, but also some rather inspiring and thoughtful content on softer topics as well. Highly recommended viewing.\nMicrosoft Sessions\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025 – David Li and Augustin Popa\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk, Augustin and David go into a lot more detail of the changes that are coming in the new versions of Visual Studio and the MSVC Build Tools. Here are some of the highlights:\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode is now available in Visual Studio. Agents can better understand intent, plan actions, and carry out tasks with less user guidance. You can provide further context to GitHub Copilot by using a custom instructions file to let it know about the preferred conventions and rules for your repo or organization, like how to add unit tests, what style you prefer for comments, and what your priorities are in terms of the quality of your code.\n\nOne of our biggest features this year is Dynamic Debugging, which allows you to deoptimize code on the fly while debugging, making the debugger more useful for projects that are performance sensitive. You will be able to see all your local variables, step reliably, and step into force inline functions. While this feature was inspired by our game dev partners, it is useful for all C++ applications that use debug and release configurations.\n\nFor the MSVC Build Tools, we continue our progress towards C++23 conformance with support for formatting ranges, std::generator, lambda attributes, and more. We also continued to improve the runtime performance of code built with the latest build tools.\nWe fixed 387 C++ issues and implemented 29 C++ feature requests in the past year.\nThere are many UI improvements in Visual Studio 2026, including 11 colorful themes to choose from, an updated Settings experience, and a dockable all-in-one search window.\nOther productivity improvements include automatic word wrap indentation, enhanced line and column navigation, a better Change Signature experience, and the ability to save files with your preferred encoding format.\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents – Alexandra Kemper\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis session highlighted several important improvements and new features, covering extensions like the C/C++ extension, the CMake Tools extension, and GitHub Copilot extension.\nPerformance is one of the major areas of feedback received for the C/C++ extension, and the latest versions have changes that significantly speed up project startup times and reduce the time for source to be parsed and colorized in the editor. Benchmarks show up to 4x faster colorization for large codebases.\nThe CMake Tools extension now supports version 10 of CMake Presets which adds features like adding comments in the JSON presets files via the “$comment” field and additional support for generating a project dependency graph with Graphviz. By popular demand, the CMake Tools extension now has full language service protocol (LSP) support for CMake, as well as the option to exclude specific CMake folders from the project view for easier code navigation.\nGitHub Copilot support in Visual Studio Code is also improving rapidly, with various AI agents available to users today. Visual Studio Code also has great support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables the creation of tools to perform specific actions and exposes those tools to agents. Beyond the agent improvements, Visual Studio Code has also been making GitHub Copilot completions more context-aware and tailored to common C++ coding patterns, and next edit suggestions (NES) can predict the next expected change based on your previous changes and the coding patterns, making changes that span many lines in your codebase much easier.\nAll features covered in the talk are already publicly available; try them out today and let us know what you think!\n\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugger: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code – Eric Brumer\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nEric’s talk covered the use of C++ Dynamic Debugging to effectively debug your optimized code. You don’t have to worry about any more ‘variable was optimized away’ messages, and taking normal debugger actions like step-over and step-into behaves exactly as you would expect it to. It also covered the underlying technical details which make the feature powerful, easy to use, and fast to build.\nLearn more at https://aka.ms/vcdd and https://aka.ms/dynamicdebugging.\n   \nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]! – Inbal Levi\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThe talk introduces the static reflection feature that was voted into the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) in the C++ standard committee, which reviewed the design of the library side of the reflection feature. The session introduced reflection and its transformative potential within our codebases. After a brief history and introduction of utilities from the latest reflection proposal, Inbal explored the possibilities for “Reflection Libraries” and demonstrated potential directions for future improvements.\n  \nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Ben McMorran\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nBen’s talk was all about why the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is needed to address a variety of problems that AI assistants encounter when they want to evolve beyond a simple chat interface. The MCP solves these problems by providing an open and standard way for tools to provide context and actions to AI agents. For me, the most interesting part of the talk was seeing an MCP agent get implemented and seeing just how simple, yet powerful, they can be. They really form a major backbone of a successful agentic AI system.\n\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI – Ion Todirel\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIon’s talk was about practical advice for using AI tools, specifically for embedded and systems programming tasks. The advice offered was based on real-world problems and attempts to solve them using the AI tools that exist today. I’d say that a lot of the points made are relevant to tasks outside of that domain as well, and a key takeaway I had was that if at first your prompt doesn’t succeed, prompt again. Eventually, with enough experience (and advice) you’ll improve your prompts to get the most effective results and save you time when using an AI assistant.\n    \nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial – Michael Price\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis was my talk and I had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it. I walk through some of the key things that a C++ developer needs to know to get started with game development, focusing on Blender, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio 2026. The key takeaway for this talk is that while getting into game development can be intimidating due to unfamiliar tools and techniques, modern tools really lower the barrier. You can make simple 3D game assets in just a few minutes and easily import them into your project, and making your existing C++ code available to Unreal Engine is actually not that hard.\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop – Victor Ciura\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nHybrid C++/Rust codebases are quickly becoming more common – at Microsoft and everywhere in the industry. Having seamless interop between the C++ and Rust components is essential for the success of this symbiosis. There are many challenges in this process, but people found various ways to make things work – from dealing with ABI compatibility and platform/toolchain guarantees, to going down to C and FFI, to various techniques and tools for generating glue-code between the two languages. Many of the explored solutions so far by the community fail to deliver on all the needed requirements, swinging the wide range between performant and ergonomic. Victor highlighted all the interop challenges, some of the good solutions out there, and teased out the avenues at the forefront of this pursuit.\n\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Bharat Kumar\n\nC++ remains a foundational language for high-performance applications, but its lack of inherent memory safety and prevalence of undefined behaviors pose serious challenges. Rewriting the vast corpus of existing C++ code into a memory-safe language isn’t feasible in the short term, especially for large-scale projects like Microsoft Edge, which is built atop Chromium’s predominantly C++ codebase. Fortunately, meaningful safety improvements are possible without a full rewrite. Chandranath and Bharat explore how the Edge team systematically addresses safety across four core dimensions: bounds checking, lifetime management, initialization correctness, and type safety. These efforts are grounded in real-world engineering constraints and aim to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities while preserving performance. They also delve into complementary initiatives targeting thread safety, definition safety, and the mitigation of other undefined behaviors. By combining targeted refactoring, static analysis, and safer abstractions, the Microsoft Edge team is charting a pragmatic path toward more resilient C++ code. The session offers insights into scalable safety strategies that can be adopted across large legacy codebases.\n    \nBack to Basics: Code Review – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk Chandranath and Kathleen examined examples of common C++ coding mistakes the Microsoft Edge team has come across when reviewing code and shared practical strategies to avoid them. They explored best practices for variable scoping, iteration, function and class design, and useful STL functions and algorithms. The talk also provided clang-tidy checks and warnings to use to catch these common issues.\nC++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects – Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nPrithvi and Kathleen’s session focused on techniques to prevent copying or moving objects in favor of in-place construction. It included many code examples with clang-tidy checks and warnings you can use to point out the potential areas of improvement in your own code. They highlighted guidelines such as passing non-trivial objects by reference, using view types, leveraging in-place constructors, best practices for containers like using emplace and transparent comparators, and finally eliminating runtime cost by moving computation to compile time.\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second – Daniel Lemire (Université du Québec) and Francisco Geiman Thiesen (Microsoft)\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIt is fair to say that reflection was one of the latest additions to the library that has attracted the most attention and it was a subject discussed in many of the talks in this edition of CppCon.\nIn this talk Daniel and Francisco discussed their experience integrating the latest C++26 reflection proposal into the open source simdjson library. A few interesting takeaways from the talk:\nReflection allows the user to deserialize/serialize their types without having to write any boilerplate code; something that previously took a LOT of boilerplate.\nYou can get best-in-class performance by using reflection together with several optimizations, even when extending a library that was designed only with deserialization in mind.\nFor now this is an experimental feature already available in the library. It should gain more traction whenever the latest reflection proposal is added to MSVC, GCC, and\nHandling JSON is a poster-child use case for reflection and they went above and beyond to integrate that into the simdjson library, while still following its design principles and guaranteeing the absolute best performance.\nSlides are publicly available in: C++26 Reflection for JSON Serialization – A Practical Journey\n\nOther Sessions of Interest\nIn addition to the keynotes and our own Microsoft sessions, here are some sessions I managed to catch during my very busy week that I thought were interesting.\nPanel: What We Learned About AI Tools For C++ Engineers – Guy Davidson, Daisy Hollman, Inbal Levi, Jason Turner, Matt Godbolt, Michael Wong\nThe conference hosted a panel on the topic of AI for C++ Engineers, on which senior members of the C++ training, tooling, and authoring community offered their experience of using these tools, how they have improved their workflow, where the shortcomings are, and what the ideal future will hold. They are also keen to hear the experiences of other engineers who have experimented with AI tools.\nCommittee Fireside Chat – Herb Sutter, Jeff Garland, Andrei Alexandrescu, Bjarne Stroustrup, Gabriel Dos Reis, Inbal Levi, Guy Davidson, Timur Doumler, Barry Revzin, Nina Ranns, Khalil Estell, Vittorio Romeo, Ruslan Arutyunyan, Daisy Hollman\nIf you’d like to learn more about C++26’s additions of static reflection, async model (std::execution), contracts, and significant safety improvements, this is the session for you.\nWrapping It Up\nCongrats, you made it to the end! Thanks for reading through all the way. Be sure to come back and check out the Microsoft C++ blog (this one!) over the coming weeks as we make new announcements for Visual Studio 2026 and all of our other C++ products, and we hope to see you all next September in Aurora!\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 getting closer to General Availability (GA), we want to share with you how you can upgrade your projects from your current versions of Visual Studio and the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools to the latest versions. The new IDE ships with the v145 platform toolset for MSBuild C++ projects and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. In this post, I will walk you through the process step-by-step, while explaining some of the features available to you to make the transition as painless as possible. Overall, our goal is to help you get current and stay current.\nStep 1: Try out Visual Studio 2026\nAs of September 9, 2025, you can install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Once the stable release of Visual Studio 2026 ships, you will be able to download it from the same link. You can choose between Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise as before. Visual Studio instances can be installed side-by-side from the Visual Studio Installer application, so you can keep your current version of Visual Studio while exploring 2026.\nIf you are not ready to fully migrate yet, you can load your existing Visual Studio MSBuild (.sln/.vcxproj) projects in Visual Studio 2026 and retain compatibility with your existing copy of Visual Studio without having to upgrade the project files.\nStep 2: Migrate to Visual Studio 2026, stay on existing MSVC Build Tools\nIf you’re satisfied with your Visual Studio 2026 experience and are ready to use it daily, you can do so without needing to use the latest MSVC Build Tools. The installer for Visual Studio 2026 gives you the ability to install your existing C++ build tools going back as far as Visual Studio 2015. You can select multiple components/versions to include for your Visual Studio instance.\n\nHowever, there is an even easier way to get started in Visual Studio 2026 and stay on your existing MSVC toolset version.\nInstall missing tools with Visual Studio setup assistant\nYou can use the new setup assistant experience to install missing tools and/or retarget any projects that are ready to move forward. You do not have to install and upgrade everything all at once.\n\nThis assistant will appear by default when you load your solution for the first time, or you can right-click the solution and select Retarget solution. To stay on a project’s existing toolset version and install any missing tools, choose the “Install missing Platform Toolset…” option. You can also click the Install All button to instantly set all the dropdowns to that option. If you already have the correct toolset version installed and want to stay on it, no action needs to be taken.\nYou will also see options to retarget your projects. You can go back and select these later when you are ready to move your projects and toolset version forward to the latest. Retargeting will update the Windows SDK Version, Platform Toolset, and MSVC Build Tools Version project properties. You may select what to do for each project or retarget all of them at once with the Retarget all button.\nFundamentally, the setup assistant allows you to upgrade gradually at your own pace.\nStep 3: Upgrade MSVC Build Tools to version 14.50\nWhen you decide it’s the right time to upgrade and explore the latest MSVC toolset, the process is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Visual Studio aims to support you to get current and stay current on the latest tools.\nWhy you should upgrade your C++ build tools\nBy upgrading, you get access to new C++ language updates and bug fixes in the Microsoft C++ compiler and standard library. In addition, if you upgrade, you get runtime performance improvements:\nUp to +6%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nRetarget your projects with the setup assistant\nAs mentioned previously, the setup assistant can help you retarget your projects, so they build with the latest MSVC Build Tools.\n\nBelow is a quick video demonstration of the setup assistant in action to install missing tools and retarget projects.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4\n\nThere are the new MSVC components in the Visual Studio Installer.\n\nComponents marked as “Latest” will be updated to the latest available version when you update the IDE, while components with a major and minor version number will remain on that minor version and only receive servicing updates while in support.\nC++ binary compatibility for step-by-step upgrades\nWe’re announcing that MSVC Build Tools version 14.50 preserves binary compatibility with any code built with MSVC tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 or later. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and external dependencies all at once. The Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable, which ships the Visual C++ v14 Runtime, also continues to maintain this binary compatibility. Note: there are a few restrictions with the binary compatibility experience, which you should review in our documentation.\nAs a result of this binary compatibility, you can upgrade your code step-by-step, component by component. You can also update your main application while your external dependencies remain on an older version. For your third party open-source dependencies, you can use the vcpkg package manager to rebuild them with the latest toolset or any previous MSVC toolset shipping in Visual Studio 2026.\nStep 4: Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++\nBut wait, there’s more! GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ helps you migrate your C++ projects to the latest MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, you may need to make additional source code or project system changes due to deprecations or fixes in the newer toolset. Copilot will help you iterate through these changes until all warnings and errors are resolved. GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is coming soon to Visual Studio 2026 in Private Preview. Check out our announcement post for more information and join the waitlist.\nGet Current, Stay Current\nOur goal is for you to have a painless upgrade to Visual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. If you run into any issues with your upgrade, please don’t hesitate to contact us at vcupgrade@microsoft.com and feel free to drop a comment below.

Over time, it evolved into Grazie Pro, adding style control, terminology rules, and multilingual support.\nNow, with the core proofreading technology fully integrated into the IDE, Grazie is no longer a separate external plugin but a built-in component.\nWhat’s changing for Grazie Pro users\nMost of Grazie Pro’s functionality now lives in the built-in Natural Languages plugin that ships with the IDE, with cloud checks being available in AI Assistant. The standalone Grazie Pro plugin will not be updated for IDE versions 2025.3 and later.\nA few Pro-only features aren’t yet available in the integrated version, including:\nPer-project style guides\nVanilla Vale support\nSyntax-aware selection\nPart-of-speech highlighting\nLocal machine learning error correction (MLEC)\nWe’re collecting feedback to decide which of these features to migrate, rework, or retire.\n👉 Vote for the features you’d like to see migrated\nWhy this change matters\nIntegrating Grazie natively allows us to:\nDeliver proofreading and writing assistance consistently across all JetBrains IDEs.\nShip improvements alongside IDE updates.\nReduce compatibility issues and plugin maintenance overhead.\nOur goal is to make natural language a first-class citizen in JetBrains IDEs, supporting not just correct English or German but also effective communication between developers and AI tools.\nWhat’s new in the built-in grammar and style checks\nThe built-in Natural Languages plugin combines Grazie’s proven proofreading with an extended set of capabilities:\nWriting domains – tailor the checks for different contexts like commit messages, prompting with AI, code comments, technical documentation, UI text, or general prose.\nGranular tone and style settings – adjust formality, clarity, and tone directly in your IDE.\nSmarter performance and detection – faster, lighter, and more consistent across editors.\nYou can use local proofreading out of the box, or switch to JetBrains AI Assistant for advanced cloud-based grammar and style checks, plus AI-powered rewrite, completion, and translation actions.\nSome cloud functionality – like Rephrase and more advanced proofreading – will also be available even without AI Assistant.\nNote: Accepting cloud-based grammar and style suggestions does not consume your AI quota.\nOther AI-powered actions, such as Rephrase or Translate, do use your AI quota, but typically at a much lower rate than code generation or refactoring. For approximate quota spending by different AI actions, see the AI Assistant usage guide.\n🙏 Grazie – and grazie!\nBecause in any language, saying “thank you” never goes out of style.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains .NET Days Online 2025, Jason Taylor, Microsoft MVP and Solutions Architect at Particular Software, delivered an engaging presentation that transforms how we think about building distributed systems. Through live coding and interactive polls with the audience, Taylor demonstrated how .NET Aspire can turn what’s traditionally been a complex, friction-filled process into something surprisingly manageable.\nWhether you’re building your first distributed system or looking to modernize an existing one, Jason Taylor’s presentation offers both practical techniques and a refreshing perspective on how development tools should work. In short, they should make the complex feel effortless.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\nEffortless Distributed Systems With .NET Aspire – Jason Taylor, October 2025.\nThe philosophy of “effortless”\nJason Taylor opens with a crucial distinction that sets the tone for the entire presentation: \n“Effortless doesn’t mean no effort. It means reducing friction and spending effort in the right places.” \n(02:03)\nThis philosophy underpins everything that follows. .NET Aspire isn’t about eliminating work, but about eliminating the wrong kind of work.\nThe goal, as the speaker explains, is straightforward: “Shifting the focus back to what matters, right? Delivering features that users care about. We want to reduce wasted effort by eliminating manual setup, wiring, and boilerplate.”\nFrom zero to orchestrated in minutes\nStarting with a basic ASP.NET Core application that’s intentionally unreliable, Jason shows how adding .NET Aspire immediately transforms the development experience. With just a few clicks, the application gains automatic retry policies, service discovery, health checks, and comprehensive telemetry.\nThe transformation is dramatic: “When we added orchestration support to our application, we got lots of things for free. And one of those was HTTP client resilience, and it was using Polly to retry that request whenever it failed.” (10:16) No configuration files, no manual wiring – just instant resilience.\nThe developer experience revolution\nPerhaps the most compelling aspect of Jason’s demonstration is how Aspire transforms the local development experience. “The best part of course is our local development experience couldn’t be simpler or better. One press of F5 launches the entire system ready to test and observe instantly. (42:07)” \nBut this feature isn’t just about convenience for experienced developers, as Jason also emphasizes its utility when it comes to team onboarding: “That’s an excellent experience for a new developer who joins your team and is trying to get up and running. They press F5, then they start learning about the system.” Gone are the days of lengthy setup documentation and “but it works on my machine” problems.\nLive database migration without the pain\nIn one of the presentation’s interactive moments, Jason lets the audience vote on which database to use, and PostgreSQL wins over Azure SQL (14:27 ). What follows is a masterclass in how Aspire handles infrastructure changes. Within minutes, he swaps out SQLite for PostgreSQL, complete with Docker containerization, migrations, and service discovery.\nThe key insight: “No more juggling startup projects. With service defaults, we instantly get service discovery, health checks, resilience, and telemetry, all without manual setup.”\nMessaging made simple\nJason then tackles one of distributed systems’ thorniest challenges – reliable messaging (22:45). Using NServiceBus (from his employer, Particular Software), he demonstrates how Aspire’s abstraction model makes switching between message transports effortless. The audience votes for RabbitMQ over Azure Service Bus, and Jason seamlessly makes the switch with minimal code changes, all while maintaining the same local development experience.\nFrom local to cloud without the usual headaches\nThe presentation’s climax comes when Jason deploys the entire system to Azure (42:39). Using the Azure Developer CLI (azd) with Aspire’s deployment manifest, he sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps (another audience choice) in under five minutes.\n“With Aspire, our C# app model became the source of truth. We didn’t write any Bicep, ARM, or Terraform code. The deployment manifest describes our entire system and feeds directly into tools like AZD.” The entire infrastructure, including databases, message queues, and observability tools, is derived from the C# code that defines the application.\nThe bottom line\nJason Taylor’s closing advice distills the entire presentation into actionable wisdom: \n“Choose the right tools, remove the friction, and focus on what truly matters, delivering features that make an impact.”\nFollow Jason Taylor on X or visit his blog for more content on .NET, Azure, and distributed systems.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI With Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nComposing Distributed Applications With .NET Aspire – a presentation from .NET Days 2024 by Cecil Phillip that demonstrates .NET Aspire’s approach to building distributed apps.\n.NET Aspire and Dev Container – an article by Laurent Kempé showing how to work with .NET Aspire 9.1 inside a Dev Container using JetBrains Rider.\nSimplify Your .NET Development With Aspire – a step-by-step guide by Microsoft MVP Joseph Guadagno on adding .NET Aspire to an existing .NET 9 web app, including specific instructions for JetBrains Rider.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve ever tried to track down a bug in concurrent programs, you know how chaotic and frustrating it can be: everything seems to work fine, then suddenly crashes, and you can’t quite pin down why – all while the bugs slip through. \nTo bring order to this chaos, at JetBrains Research we built LitmusKt — a novel testing tool for Kotlin’s multiplatform concurrency. Designed specifically for Kotlin’s unique mix of JVM, Native, and JavaScript backends, LitmusKt helps developers uncover and eliminate subtle, platform-specific concurrency errors that traditional testing can’t catch.\nIn our previous post, we discussed a new approach to fuzzing the Kotlin compiler. Now we’re exploring how LitmusKt takes that work further – systematically revealing concurrency bugs hidden deep in the Kotlin runtime and compiler. In this post, we will:\nTalk about why concurrent programming is complex and why automated testing is particularly tricky.\nExplain how LitmusKt was needed for the Kotlin compiler and describe its cool technical features.\nLay out the history of LitmusKt, from its infancy as a research prototype, some of the bugs it found, and how it is now integrated into Kotlin/Native development.\nConcurrent programming\nWhen multiple tasks or computations are executed simultaneously rather than sequentially, the approach is called concurrent programming. Although it may sound like a simple concept, it can sometimes act erratically when implemented improperly. \nIf it is so tricky, why is concurrent programming even implemented? Well, many programming problems are naturally concurrent: there are numerous tasks and external events running at the same time. Consider also how modern hardware itself is inherently concurrent, as most CPUs have multiple cores. Without concurrent code, we would not be able to use the cores to their full potential.\nIn Per Brinch Hansen’s The Invention of Concurrent Programming (which covers the history of concurrent programming up to 2001), he tells a story where he and Peter Kraft needed to design a real-time system for a large chemical plant. For this, a computer would perform a fixed number of tasks simultaneously. The tasks’ speed could be manually adjusted by the plant operators, which means that there was no set speed. \nSo they were working with simultaneous tasks and needed some sort of process synchronization. Sequential, task-independent programming wasn’t going to cut it. If you want to know what happens next, you can find it in Part I of their book (spoiler: they implemented Edsger Dijkstra’s semaphores).\nConcurrent programming provides a number of advantages, including:\nImproved performance and throughput. More tasks are completed in a given timeframe. This is especially beneficial on multi-core processors, where different tasks can run on different cores.\nEfficient resource use, because system resources (like the CPU) can be used for other tasks while one task is waiting for input/output or another event. This reduces idle time and maximizes hardware efficiency.\nBetter responsiveness and user experience, because applications like web browsers, graphical user interfaces, and real-time systems remain responsive to input while other tasks run in the background. This supports smooth and uninterrupted user interactions.\nChallenges in concurrent programming\nWhen concurrent programming was first introduced in the 1960s, the operating systems running it were rather unstable. Challenges included the following:\nA small programming error could cause a lot of problems but be really difficult to test for and therefore fix.\nDeadlocks, or when all parts of a concurrent process are blocked, usually due to a lack of resources.\nConcurrent programming inherently involves simultaneously executed tasks. For this reason, challenges like the above arise because concurrent programming is highly dependent on unpredictable factors such as scheduling order or real-world timing. Let’s look at an example.\nConsider a program that initializes two shared variables, x and y, with 0, and starts two threads running in parallel. Each thread writes 1 to its associated variable. Then, each reads the other variable and stores that value as its result (r1 and r2, respectively, which are also initialized with 0).\n\nAt first glance, the outcomes for r1 and r2 seem limited and predictable. Either:\nOne thread finishes first, so it writes 1 to x, reads 0 from y, and the other reads the updated value 1, giving us straightforward outcomes of (0, 1) or (1, 0), depending on which thread finished first.\nOr both threads execute at the same time, so they both write 1, and both read 1, yielding another expected result: (1, 1).\nBut then, after running the program many times, a seemingly impossible outcome starts to appear: Each thread reads 0, even though both have written 1.\n\nThis sort of bizarre outcome is called weak behavior. It can happen for one of two reasons:\nCompiler optimizations, where compilers rearrange instructions or eliminate redundant memory operations to increase performance. This can result in subtle bugs, or even break the code, as dependencies may be lost in the shuffle.\nCPU buffering and reordering, where the hardware itself may buffer, delay, or reorder reads and writes to maximize efficiency. Modern CPUs have weak memory models that allow operations to happen in surprising sequences, invisible in regular single-threaded programs.\nWeak behaviors caused by the above are a central focus in analyzing and testing concurrent programs with specialized tools. If the programmer only looks at the code or thinks in terms of simple statement interleaving, these outcomes seem impossible. \nIn reality, compiler and CPU optimizations change the story, making concurrent programming far more elusive and unpredictable than it appears at first glance. This creates headaches for programmers and those designing programming languages. Because reasoning about these subtle interactions is so challenging, thorough testing is essential to ensure reliability.\nTesting concurrent programs\nConcurrent programming is difficult to test because nondeterministic thread interactions can produce subtle, non-reproducible failures. These are often called Heisenbugs, and they only appear under specific timings or schedules, making them inherently hard to find and troubleshoot. The same input can pass a test and then fail the very same test depending on subtle, uncontrollable sources of nondeterminism, and even the act of observing or debugging can mask or alter the bug’s behavior, contributing to flaky tests and prolonged debugging cycles.\nTraditional testing approaches struggle here because listing all possible thread schedules is infeasible in practice, and even systematic methods that control scheduling to capture nondeterminism are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This challenge is compounded by state space explosion, where the number of possible interleavings grows combinatorially with threads and synchronization points, necessitating reductions such as partial-order reduction and guided exploration to avoid redundant paths.\nFor testing these notoriously tricky programs, developers use a variety of strategies. Some common ones are listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n\nWhile code review and static analysis are both useful for early detection of concurrency bugs, they come with disadvantages as well. Namely, code review is susceptible to the reviewers’ errors and knowledge gaps; static analysis can generate false positives, thereby creating more work, and can miss runtime-only errors.\nRandom/fuzz/stress testing types are great for detecting rare or subtle bugs. They test programs under extreme conditions, for example with random inputs and under heavy load. These tests (especially stress testing) can also be useful to ensure smooth operation of a program in critical situations. These methods are usually resource-intensive, and they can sometimes produce false positives or miss more complex issues.\nMany strategies work well with business logic and modest concurrency patterns, but fall short with the subtle hardware or compiler optimizations that lead to “impossible” results, like the (0,0) outcome above. For example, stress testing or fuzzing may uncover these bugs eventually, but a specific type of tests called litmus tests is designed to systematically target these subtle behaviors and confirm theoretical predictions. This strategy is highly effective for environments with well-defined memory models, like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or specific CPUs.\nFor the rest of this post, we will concentrate on litmus testing and then tell you about a specific litmus testing tool developed by JetBrains researchers.\nLitmus testing\nLitmus testing is like stress testing for concurrency: you write small concurrent programs (i.e., litmus tests) and run them thousands of times to catch rare, weird behaviors that only happen under specific timing conditions. Established tools like JCStress for Java and herdtools for assembly language have successfully found real bugs in production systems.\nJCStress, for instance, is used by OpenJDK developers to test the JVM, catching subtle race conditions and memory model violations that could cause catastrophic failures in production. herdtools goes even deeper, testing assembly-level programs against processor memory models to ensure hardware behaves as expected. While these tools are useful for the respective languages, they run into limitations with multi-platform languages like Kotlin.\nUnlike other languages, a key feature of Kotlin is that it compiles to JVM, Native, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, and each platform has its own distinct concurrency semantics and memory models. This diversity means some bugs cannot be caught with tools designed for just one backend – and so far existing tools hadn’t been able to handle this complexity. In other words, Kotlin needed its own litmus testing tool.\nWe took on the challenge of helping to discover bugs in the Kotlin compiler, and the result is a new tool that makes testing these tricky programs far easier. \nTesting concurrency programs with LitmusKt\nTo overcome the lack of a proper Kotlin testing tool for concurrency programming, we  at  JetBrains Research) decided to build our own solution, LitmusKt (see their recent paper). This section will tell you about its design and tech highlights, as well as its practical applications.\nLitmusKt’s design and cool technical features\nLitmusKt allows developers to write litmus tests once and run them across both Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native platforms. The tool uses a custom domain-specific language that makes writing tests straightforward. A few examples of what LitmusKt does:\nDeclare shared states, such as shared variables, between threads.\nWrite thread behavior so that it’s clear what each thread should do.\nLabel expected outcomes as acceptable, interesting (i.e., noteworthy but allowed), or forbidden.\nBy using a custom DSL, developers can express thread interactions, shared variables, and outcome conditions flexibly, all within Kotlin. This lowers the barrier for writing complex concurrency tests.\nLet’s run through an example. Below you can find the code for the Store Buffering test, which is a standard litmus test (it’s also the program we saw in the example before). The test involves (i) defining a shared state, (ii) running code for several threads, and (iii) specifying  test outcomes; we will go through each one step by step.\nobject StoreBuffering {\n val Plain = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar x = 0\n\tvar y = 0\n    }\n}) {\n   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }\n   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }\n   spec {\n\taccept(r1:0, r2:1)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:0)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:1)\n\tinteresting(r1:0, r2:0)\n   }\n   reset { x = 0; y = 0 }\n}\nFirst, the test itself needs to be declared: we declare the state which will eventually be shared between the threads. In the example below, this comprises two int variables. \nobject StoreBuffering {\n val Plain = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar x = 0\n\tvar y = 0\n    }\nNext comes the code for each thread, shown below.\n}) {\n   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }\n   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }\nFinally, we must declare the outcomes and their labels. The possible outcomes are:\nAcceptable: sequentially consistent outcomes\nInteresting: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language\n spec {\n\taccept(r1:0, r2:1)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:0)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:1)\n\tinteresting(r1:0, r2:0)\n   }\nIf you recall the example above, the result where r1 = 0 and r2 = 0 was unexpected, because it is weak behavior. In the code for the test, this result will be labelled as interesting, meaning it is acceptable but noteworthy. The other listed results are expected and therefore will be labelled as acceptable. \nLet’s look at what happens when we run the test with LitmusKt. How often do we see weak behavior in one million tests?\n\nThe above screenshot shows that interesting outcomes do occur, but that they are relatively rare, at less than five percent. To increase the frequency of finding these weak but tolerable outcomes, LitmusKt enables the user to apply different parameters to increase the number of complex interactions (see the paper for further details).\nNow that we know how to write a test in LitmusKt, let’s look at the more technical details. Our team built a custom Kotlin/Native test runner from scratch because no solutions existed up until then. The test runner is built on techniques from other litmus testing tools, such as careful thread synchronization and CPU affinity control. We created a test runner so that the threads modify different states simultaneously many times over, significantly increasing the likelihood that a concurrent interaction occurs and weak behavior can be detected.\nFor Kotlin/JVM, we integrated the tool with the existing JCStress framework, as it is known to be successful in uncovering concurrency bugs in various JVM implementations. Despite some integration challenges, the end interface is seamless for the user.\nTo summarize, LitmusKt incorporates proven methods to maximize the frequency of rare behaviors and provides powerful reporting tools for manual and automated analysis. Users can also interact via a rich command-line interface, adjusting test parameters, durations, and system settings.\nConsidering all these features, has LitmusKt caught any Kotlin bugs? As we will see in the next section, it has. \nLitmusKt and real code\nWe applied LitmusKt and several litmus tests to analyze the behavior of Kotlin programs, therefore testing the results of the Kotlin compiler and looking for previously unknown issues. The possible outcomes here are:\nAcceptable: sequentially consistent outcomes\nInteresting: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language\nForbidden: weak intolerable outcomes, indicating bugs\nIn contrast to the Store Buffering Test above, this analysis includes two weak outcomes: one tolerable and one intolerable, where the latter outcome represents a bug. The testing results are shown in the following image, where ACC, INT, and FORB stand for acceptable, interesting, and forbidden. \n\nWe can see that there are a number of tests uncovering interesting results, and one test in particular with forbidden results. The test abbreviated as UPUB in the table is unsafe publication. The forbidden results represent a situation where objects could be accessed before proper initialization, potentially causing rare and critical failures in production environments. The fact that memory-unsafe behavior could slip through in a memory-safe language like Kotlin demonstrates why systematic concurrency testing is essential. \nLet’s look more closely at unsafe publication, shown in the code below, and what unexpected outcomes arose.\nclass IntHolder(val x: Int = 0)\n val UnsafePublication = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar h : IntHolder? = null\n    }\n}) {\n   thread { h = IntHolder() }\n   thread { r1 = h?.x ?: -1 }\n   spec { accept(0); accept(-1) }\n   reset { h = null }\n}\nIn the code above, we can see a simple class IntHolder with a single integer. The shared state is a reference to this class. Then, we have two threads: one which is going to create a new class, and one which will try to read its variable.\nThe outcome of running the unsafe publication test was expected to be one of two scenarios: \nThe class IntHolder is initialized —> 0\nThe class IntHolder is not initialized —> -1\nThe actual outcome of running the unsafe publication test with Kotlin 1.9 is shown in the following image. Any result which is not declared as interesting or acceptable is considered forbidden.\n\nUnexpectedly, garbage values could be read from uninitialized memory. A memory-safe language like Kotlin definitely should not let this happen. In other words, our team found a new compiler bug thanks to LitmusKt. Since identifying the bug, our team has already fixed and merged it. As of Kotlin 1.9.20 and later, this bug no longer occurs. \nWe found further issues while running unsafe publication with LitmusKt (see the paper for more details). As these are valuable insights for the Kotlin compiler, and after discussion with the Kotlin/Native development team, LitmusKt is now embedded in the Kotlin CI/CD pipeline.\nIn addition to the issues arising from running different tests, we discovered more noteworthy outcomes. The below image contains the partial code of a standard litmus test and the resulting outcomes.\n\nAs can be seen in the above image, the test produces only three outcomes. So far, nothing crazy. The interesting bit happens when the code is slightly altered with semantically equivalent changes. That is, these changes theoretically should not result in any additional thread interactions. However, as the below image shows, another outcome actually does show up.\n\nThis extra outcome, marked in pink in the above image, is actually a weak outcome, as it cannot be achieved by interleaving execution of threads. We suspect that such behavior is caused by compiler optimizations. In the future, it might be worthwhile to combine compiler fuzzing (i.e., with random code mutations) with litmus testing to discover more edge cases.\nBringing order to Kotlin concurrency\nLitmusKt proves that even in the mayhem of concurrent programming, order can be found. By catching bugs that once slipped through the cracks of the Kotlin compiler, it has made multiplatform Kotlin development more reliable than ever.\nWith LitmusKt now part of Kotlin’s CI pipeline, every new compiler version benefits from systematic concurrency testing – ensuring that subtle memory model violations are caught before they reach developers.\nWe didn’t just build a tool; we established a new way to think about concurrency testing for multiplatform languages.\nIn short, LitmusKt:\nBrings automated, multiplatform litmus testing to Kotlin for the first time.\nUncovered and helped fix multiple concurrency bugs in Kotlin/Native.\nOpened new possibilities for hybrid testing approaches that combine compiler fuzzing with concurrency analysis.\nLitmusKt is open-source and ready to help you explore, understand, and test the complex behaviors of concurrent programs across Kotlin’s many platforms.\n👉 Try LitmusKt on GitHub\n                                    \nFurther reading\nCurious to explore the research or try out litmus testing on your own code?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In today’s software development landscape, AI coding agents are evolving rapidly from prototypes into indispensable tools. Yet the industry still lacks an open, neutral, standards-based way to measure the real-world effectiveness of these agents across languages, frameworks, and environments.\nWith over two decades of experience building developer tools that are trusted by millions worldwide, we bring deep expertise in both tooling and developer workflows. This is why we are launching the Developer Productivity AI Arena (DPAI Arena). \nDPAI Arena is an open benchmarking platform for evaluating AI-assisted developer productivity tools through multi-language, multi-framework, and multi-workflow benchmarks, and we intend to contribute it to the Linux Foundation.\nWhy a new platform is needed\nThe rise of AI-assisted coding has outpaced our ability to measure it meaningfully. While current popular OSS-based benchmarks were an important early step, these have several well-known limitations:\nOutdated datasets: The underlying data for the open benchmarks does not reflect modern development workflows.\nPatch-only focus: They test only a single workflow (issue → patch), without evaluating PR reviews, coverage goals, or compliance.\nNo evaluation of modern agents: They benchmark LLMs, not coding agents. Numerous features and optimization possibilities specific to coding agents are not considered by LLM benchmarks.\nHard to reproduce: Their complex setup and limited transparency make consistent comparisons difficult.\nIn short, benchmarks from 2023 cannot measure 2025 workflows. AI development has evolved, and our benchmarks must evolve with it.\nWhat makes DPAI Arena unique?\nDPAI Arena is an open benchmark platform, which was designed by JetBrains and with an intent to contribute to the Linux Foundation. It was created to measure AI-assisted developer productivity across multiple languages, frameworks, and workflow types.\nUnlike single-dataset benchmarks, DPAI Arena introduces a multi-track architecture – a flexible framework where different communities and vendors can contribute datasets for specific types of software development workflows.\nIn addition to all that, DPAI Arena represents a new standard for infrastructure configuration, ensuring a consolidated, reproducible, and scalable benchmarking experience. We plan to release a CLI that will allow these benchmarks to be integrated into any of the existing CI pipelines. Currently, we are running this on TeamCity as part of the MVP. But with the release of the CLI, this can easily be ported to GitHub Actions or any other CI infrastructure.\nTrack-based framework: Measuring what developers actually do\nTraditional benchmarks evaluate only one workflow: issue → patch. DPAI Arena extends this model through a multi-track architecture that mirrors real-world engineering activities:\nIssue → patch track: Exists as the foundational track for fixing bugs and implementing feature requests.\nPR review track: Evaluates agents’ ability to analyze and improve pull requests.\nCoverage track: Measures how well agents can write or expand unit tests to increase code coverage.\nStatic analysis track: Focuses on identifying and fixing linting or static analysis issues.\nUpgrade track: Tests an agent’s capability to perform dependency or framework upgrades safely.\nCompliance track: Evaluates adherence to organizational or industry coding standards.\nEach track represents a distinct, real-world workflow. Technology vendors can contribute datasets for tracks that are most relevant to their ecosystem, enabling comprehensive evaluation across the full software development lifecycle.\nAdditional tracks may include areas such as architecture refactoring, documentation generation, or performance optimization.\nThis multi-track approach is what differentiates DPAI Arena from single-workflow academic benchmarks. It reflects the true diversity of modern software engineering.\nThe first benchmark: Java + Spring\nThe first benchmark targets applications built using the Spring framework. This benchmark contains 15 open-source Spring-based projects covering a variety of architectures – from microservices to modular monoliths, to capture the diversity of real-world enterprise development. It contains a set of 140+ tasks mirroring realistic enterprise-grade requirements spread through a typical SDLC. \nThe Spring AI Community plans to contribute spring-ai-bench built on top of the spring-ai-agents framework to the DPAI Arena. It leverages Spring-based workloads and provides a reference implementation for how technology communities can design and contribute tracks within DPAI Arena. It also provides an abstraction layer that allows to talk to multiple coding agents.\nCurrently, DPAI Arena evaluation is built using deterministic tests evaluation, based on pass/fail metrics. We plan to migrate to the quality-based evaluation through an LLM-powered judge framework. Rather than focusing solely on pass/fail metrics, judges assess whether agents follow framework-specific best practices and produce maintainable code. For example, two agents might both achieve 70% coverage, but only one follows Spring’s recommended testing patterns. This qualitative dimension ensures the benchmark rewards developer-aligned quality rather than mere task completion.\nTogether, the multi-track design, coding agent abstraction, and judge-based evaluation will make DPAI Arena the most flexible and realistic platform yet for measuring AI-assisted developer productivity.\nCore principles\nDPAI Arena’s design is grounded in principles of trust, openness, and extensibility:\nTrusted and transparent: Evaluation pipelines, scoring rules, and infrastructure are open, reproducible, and verifiable.\nMulti-track and realistic: Benchmarks reflect real developer workflows, not just patch generation.\nExtensible and inclusive: Any community or vendor can contribute datasets, tracks, and evaluation rules.\nNeutral and vendor-independent: DPAI Arena will be governed by the Linux Foundation to ensure long-term neutrality and collaboration.\nA platform built for many languages and frameworks\nThe first benchmark focuses on the Spring ecosystem, but the platform is inherently framework and language-agnostic. \nThis is where collaboration becomes vital: No single team or company can cover every technology, framework, and workload alone. Therefore, building an open platform is the only way to combine domain experience and expertise from a broad variety of industrial experts. New tracks can easily be added for Quarkus, Grails, or Helidon, and the platform can be extended to other languages such as Python, PHP, Go, and JavaScript.\nOver time, DPAI Arena will evolve into a cross-language and cross-workflow foundation for measuring real-world developer productivity in the age of AI.\nCommunity and collaboration\nDPAI Arena is a community-driven initiative, not a proprietary benchmark.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The YouTrack 2025.3 release introduces remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) support, which expands the possibilities for those who build integrations with YouTrack. This enables you to securely connect AI-powered tools to YouTrack, allowing your teams to manage their work directly from an LLM, IDE, or agent platform.\nIn addition, many new apps are now available on JetBrains Marketplace, extending YouTrack’s functionality for planning, release management, and more.\nWe also added several new AI-powered features to improve the overall user experience. Now enhanced with machine learning, the search functionality is more powerful, and YouTrack’s writing assistance now supports AI-powered text completion, helping you write at lightning speed.\nRemote MCP server\nYou can now connect AI-powered tools to YouTrack using a remote MCP server. This allows you to perform actions throughout your projects without leaving your favorite LLM, IDE, or agent platform. YouTrack’s MCP server can be used in various scenarios. Administrators can connect AI-powered tools used company-wide, while individual users can configure their own connections for personal use. Here are just a few ways YouTrack can be integrated into your AI environment.\nManage tasks through AI chats\nFor those who like to use AI through chats, the MCP server helps manage YouTrack projects more efficiently via text prompts. You can create or update tasks, log time spent on work, and retrieve information from YouTrack. While users can stay focused on their individual tasks, administrators can take advantage of bulk operations by applying actions to multiple tasks at once. Currently, our predefined actions cover projects, tasks, project teams, and users, and will be enhanced with more tools for articles.\n\n\n\n\nEnhance your agent’s capabilities with YouTrack context\nIf you use AI agents for specific work scenarios, you can now make them operate with full context awareness. For example, developers can reference an issue assigned to them in YouTrack and direct the Claude Code agent to build a feature using the information described in that task.\nDesign project-based workflows with agent builders\nFor teams creating multi-step agent workflows, YouTrack’s MCP server extends those workflows with new capabilities. It enables you to bring context from YouTrack into your AI models and perform actions both inside YouTrack and in connected tools based on YouTrack triggers. Our remote MCP server can easily be integrated with OpenAI AgentKit, n8n, and other tools.\nExtend YouTrack’s MCP functionality with custom AI tools\nYou can also expand the built-in functionality of YouTrack’s MCP server by adding custom actions. These actions are accessible through the built-in JavaScript editor, allowing you to script your own tools using apps and workflows. For app developers, the MCP server makes it possible to create custom AI tool packages tailored to specific team needs and publish them as apps on JetBrains Marketplace. These packages can be sets of custom actions for an agent platform, LLM-powered products, and more.\nAI-powered text completion\nWe continue to enhance your team’s efficiency with services powered by JetBrains AI, available to you for free. YouTrack’s writing assistance now suggests words and phrases as you type, helping you write task descriptions, comments, or whole articles faster than ever before. English and German are currently supported. The feature is context-aware, adapting its suggestions to what you write, with deeper task-specific content suggestions coming soon.\n\n\n\n\nSmarter search\nAnother AI-powered enhancement brings a more powerful search experience in YouTrack. When searching on the Issues page, you now get more accurate results thanks to machine learning improvements. The most important tasks are listed first, based on attributes such as recency, user interactions, and personal relevance. These improvements cover various scenarios when you search for text, use dynamic filters, or build complex queries.\n\n\n\n\nFull-page notification view\nWe hear your feedback regarding YouTrack’s new design and continue to work on improving it. The Notification Center view can now be expanded into a dedicated page, making it easier to scan messages and stay organized without distractions.\n\n\n\n\nNew apps on JetBrains Marketplace \nEven more apps from our certified consulting partners and third-party providers are now available to help enhance your YouTrack experience! Here are a few highlights.\nApps for team collaboration\nPlanning Poker Estimation by Appfero is a collaborative tool that brings agile estimation sessions directly into YouTrack. Teams can create planning sessions, select tasks from their backlog, vote privately using digital poker cards, reveal estimates simultaneously, and then save the agreed-upon value directly to the task field.\n\n\n\n\nRelease Manager by Evgenii Venediktov helps teams plan, track, and communicate about product releases more effectively. It adds tools for managing versions, tracking progress, and automatically generating release notes from the project overview page, providing a central place to monitor release statuses and share updates with your team.\n\n\n\n\nDocument List Widget by JetBrains lets you add customized lists of tasks and articles directly to your dashboards and project overview pages to keep key information visible to your team members. You can display and filter information for one or multiple projects, and configure different list views within each widget tab.\n\n\n\n\nApps that extend task functionality\nGoogle Calendar Sync by Dmitry Zotikov enables you to automatically map tasks to calendar events, keeping your tasks and schedule aligned. Each user can connect their own Google Calendar so that tasks assigned to them appear as events with the correct start time, duration, and reminders. The app makes it easier to manage your workload and deadlines directly from your calendar.\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Snippet Widget by Damir Yusipov allows you to add custom Markdown blocks directly to your tasks or articles. You can use it to display content from other tasks, articles, or workflows, enriching your work items with quick references.\n\n\n\n\nApps for enhancing article content\nIssue to Article by twenty20 lets you instantly generate a Knowledge Base article draft from task content. This helps teams reuse existing content as documentation, FAQs, or internal guides, ensuring that valuable information is easily accessible in every article.\n\n\n\n\nIssue List for Articles by MSP creates articles that always reflect the current state of your backlog or project work. Embed dynamic issue lists inside Knowledge Base articles by configuring a custom query (for example, “project: {Customer support} state: {In Progress}, {Open}, {New}”). The list will display matching tasks directly in the article, updating itself in real time.\n\n\n\n\nConditions for widget visibility\nWe’ve added customizable conditions that allow app developers to ensure widgets appear only when relevant. You can now see different widgets depending on whether a task or article is in a draft or published state, or based on the value of a selected issue field, as well as other conditions.\nImprovements for administrators\nManage workflow rules in projects\nIf you configure custom workflows, you can now edit workflow rules for your projects all in one place with the Workflow Rule Manager app by JetBrains.\n\n\n\n\nInvite new users to projects from tasks\nAdministrators can now invite new users directly when assigning tasks, making it even easier to add people to your project. For example, when selecting a user in the Assignee field or any other field that assigns users, you can now choose people from outside the project, and they’ll be automatically added to the project team.\n\n\n\n\nMore easily manage settings for AI features\nWe’ve updated the AI Assistant settings page to give administrators more control over which features are active for your YouTrack. We’ve also added a dedicated tab to the profile settings, allowing each user to choose which features they want access to.\n\n\n\n\nOther enhancements \nWe’ve also enhanced the onboarding experience for new users, improved the Hub authentication module features, and made other small improvements.\n \n \nCheck out the release notes for the full technical details and a comprehensive list of this release’s bug fixes and improvements. For more details on configuring the latest features, see the documentation.\nIf you use YouTrack Cloud, you’ll automatically be upgraded to YouTrack 2025.3 in accordance with our Maintenance Calendar.\nIf you have an active YouTrack Server subscription, you can upgrade to YouTrack 2025.3 today.\nIf you don’t have an active YouTrack subscription, you can use the free YouTrack for up to 10 users to test out the new version before you commit to buying!\nFor more information about the licensing options available for YouTrack, please visit our Buy page.\nYour YouTrack team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the second post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nRead the first part: Getting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nThe Evaluation Stage: Beyond Kotlin as a Playground\nOnce you’re comfortable with Kotlin in tests, it’s time for a more substantial evaluation. You have two main approaches:\nBuild a new microservice / application in Kotlin\nExtend / convert an existing Java application\n1. Build a new microservice/application in Kotlin\nStarting fresh with a new application or microservice provides the full Kotlin experience without the constraints of legacy code. This approach often provides the best learning experience and showcases Kotlin’s strengths most clearly.\nPro tip: Get expert help during this stage. While developers are naturally confident in their abilities, avoiding early mistakes in the form of Java-ish Kotlin and a lack of Kotlin-powered libraries can save months of technical debt. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is how you can avoid common pitfalls when using Kotlin from a Java background:\nPitfall: Choosing a different framework from the one you use in Java.\nTip: Stick to your existing framework. \nMost likely, you were using Spring Boot with Java, so use it with Kotlin too. Spring Boot Kotlin support is first-class, so there is no additional benefit in using something else. Moreover, you are forced to learn not only a new language but also a new framework, which only adds complexity without providing any advantage.\nImportant: Spring interferes with Kotlin’s ‘inheritance by design’ principle, which requires you to explicitly mark classes open in order to extend them.\nIn order to avoid adding the open keyword to all Spring-related classes (like @Configuration, etc.), use the following build plugin: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/all-open-plugin.html#spring-support. If you create a Spring project with the well-known online Spring initializr tool, this build plugin is already configured for you.\nPitfall: Writing Kotlin in a Java-ish way, relying on common Java APIs rather than Kotlin’s standard library: \nThis list can be very long, so let’s focus on the most common pitfalls:\nPitfall 1: Using Java Stream rather than Kotlin Collections\nTip: Always use Kotlin Collections.\nKotlin Collections are fully interoperable with Java Collections, yet equipped with straightforward and feature-rich higher-order functions that make Java Stream obsolete. \nAs follows is an example that aims to pick the top 3 products by revenue (price * sold) grouped by product category:\nJava\nrecord Product(String name, String category, double price, int sold){}\n\nList<Product> products = List.of(\n           new Product(\"Lollipop\", \"sweets\", 1.2, 321),\n           new Product(\"Broccoli\", \"vegetable\", 1.8, 5);\n\nMap<String, List<Product>> top3RevenueByCategory =\n       products.stream()\n          .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(\n                Product::category,\n                Collectors.collectingAndThen(\n                    Collectors.toList(),\n                    list -> list.stream()\n                              .sorted(Comparator.comparingDouble(\n                                  (Product p) -> p.price() * p.sold())\n                                   .reversed())\n                                   .limit(3)\n                                   .toList()\n                       \t\t)\n          )\n);\nKotlin\nval top3RevenueByCategory: Map<String, List<Product>> =\n   products.groupBy { it.category }\n       .mapValues { (_, list) ->\n           list.sortedByDescending { it.price * it.sold }.take(3)\n       }\nKotlin Java interop lets you work with Java classes and records as if they were native Kotlin, though you could also use a Kotlin (data) class instead.\nPitfall 2: Keeping on using Java’s Optional.\nTip: Embrace Nullable types. \nOne of the key reasons Java developers switch to Kotlin is for Kotlin’s built-in nullability support, which waves NullPointerExceptions goodbye. Therefore, try to use Nullable types only, no more Optionals. Do you still have Optionals in your interfaces? This is how you easily get rid of them by converting them to Nullable types:\nKotlin\n//Let’s assume this repository is hard to change, because it’s a library you depend on\nclass OrderRepository {\n      //it returns Optional, but we want nullable types\n      fun getOrderBy(id: Long): Optional<Order> = …\n}\n\n//Simply add an extension method and apply the orElse(null) trick\nfun OrderRepository.getOrderByOrNull(id: Long): Order? = \n                                    getOrderBy(id).orElse(null)\n\n//Now enjoy the safety and ease of use of nullable types:\n\n//Past:\n val g = repository.getOrderBy(12).flatMap { product ->\n     product.goody.map { it.name }\n}.orElse(\"No goody found\")\n\n//Future:\n val g = repository.getOrderByOrNull(12)?.goody?.name ?: \"No goody found\"\nPitfall 3: Continuing to use static wrappers.\nTip: Embrace Extension methods. \nExtension methods give you many benefits:\nThey make your code much more fluent and readable than wrappers.\nThey can be found with code completion, which is not the case for wrappers.\nBecause Extensions need to be imported, they allow you to selectively use extended functionality in a specific section of your application.\nJava\n//Very common approach in Java to add additional helper methods\npublic class DateUtils {\n      public static final DateTimeFormatter DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER = \n           DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\n\n      public String formatted(LocalDateTime dateTime, \n\t\t              DateTimeFormatter formatter) {\n         return dateTime.format(formatter);\n      }\n\n      public String formatted(LocalDateTime dateTime) {\n         return formatted(dateTime, DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER);\n      }\n}\n\n//Usage\n formatted(LocalDateTime.now());\n\n\n\n\nKotlin\nval DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER: DateTimeFormatter = \nDateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\")\n\n//Use an extension method, including a default argument, which omits the need for an overloaded method. \nfun LocalDateTime.asString(\n   formatter: DateTimeFormatter = DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER): String = \n      this.format(formatter)\n\n//Usage\nLocalDateTime.now().formatted()\nBe aware that Kotlin offers top-level methods and variables. This implies that we can simply declare e.g. the DEFAULT_DATE_TIME_FORMATTER top level without the need to bind to an object like is the case in Java.\nPitfall 4: Relying on (clumsily) Java APIs\nTip: Use Kotlin’s slick counterpart. \nThe Kotlin standard library uses extension methods to make Java libraries much more user-friendly, even though the underlying implementation is still Java. Almost all major third-party libraries and frameworks, like Spring, have done the same.\nExample standard library:\nJava\nString text;\ntry (\n       var reader = new BufferedReader(\n                  new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(\"out.txt\"), \n            StandardCharsets.UTF_8))) {\n   text = reader\n            .lines()\n            .collect(Collectors.joining(System.lineSeparator()));\n}\nSystem.out.println(\"Downloaded text: \" +  text + \"\\n\");\nKotlin\n//Kotlin has enhanced the Java standard library with many powerful extension methods, like on java.io.*, which makes input stream processing a snap due to its fluent nature, fully supported by code completion\n\nval text = FileInputStream(\"path\").use {\n             it.bufferedReader().readText()\n           }\nprintln(\"Downloaded text: $text\\n\");\nExample Spring:\nJava\nfinal var books =  RestClient.create()\n       .get()\n       .uri(\"http://.../api/books\")\n       .retrieve()\n       .body( new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Book>>(){}); // ⇦ inconvenient ParameterizedTypeReference\nKotlin\nimport org.springframework.web.client.body\nval books = RestClient.create()\n   .get()\n   .uri(\"http://.../api/books\")\n   .retrieve()\n   .body<List<Book>>() //⇦ Kotlin offers an extension that only requires the type without the need for a ParameterizedTypeReference\nPitfall 5: Using a separate file for each public class\nTip: Combine related public classes in a single file. \nThis allows you to get a good understanding of how a (sub-)domain is structured without having to navigate dozens of files.\nJava\n\n\n\n\nKotlin\n//For domain classes consider data classes - see why below\ndata class User(val email: String,\n            //Use nullable types for safety and expressiveness\n           val avatarUrl: URL? = null, \n           var isEmailVerified: Boolean)\n\ndata class Account(val user:User,\n              val address: Address,\n              val mfaEnabled:Boolean,\n              val createdAt: Instant)\n\ndata class Address(val street: String,\n              val city: String,\n              val postalCode: String)\nPitfall 6: Relying on the mutable programming paradigm\nTip: Embrace immutability – the default in Kotlin\nThe trend across many programming languages – including Java – is clear: immutability is winning over mutability. \nThe reason is straightforward: immutability prevents unintended side effects, making code safer, more predictable, and easier to reason about. It also simplifies concurrency, since immutable data can be freely shared across threads without the risk of race conditions.\nThat’s why most modern languages – Kotlin among them – either emphasize immutability by default or strongly encourage it. In Kotlin, immutability is the default, though mutability remains an option when truly needed.\nHere’s a quick guide to Kotlin’s immutability power pack:\n1. Use val over var\nPrefer val over var. IntelliJ IDEA will notify you if you used a var, for which a val could be used. \n2. Use (immutable) data classes with copy(...)\nFor domain-related classes, use data classes with val. Kotlin data classes are often compared with Java records. Though there is some overlap, data classes offer the killer feature copy(...), whose absence makes transforming record – which is often needed in business logic – so tedious:\nJava\n//only immutable state\npublic record Person(String name, int age) {\n   //Lack of default parameters requires overloaded constructor\n   public Person(String name) { \n       this(name, 0);\n   }\n   //+ due to lack of String interpolation\n  public String sayHi() {\n       return \"Hello, my name is \" + name + \" and I am \" + age + \" years old.\";\n   }\n}\n\n//Usage\nfinal var jack = new Person(\"Jack\", 42);\njack: Person[name=Jack, age=5]\n\n//The issue is here: transforming a record requires manually copying the identical state to the new instance ☹️\nfinal var fred = new Person(\"Fred\", jack.name);\nKotlin\n//also supports mutable state (var)\ndata class Person(val name: String,\n                  val age: Int = 0) {\n  //string interpolation\n  fun sayHi() = \"Hi, my name is $name and I am $age years old.\"\n}\nval jack = Person(\"Jack\", 42)\njack: Person(name=Jack, age=42)\n\n//Kotlin offers the copy method, which, due to the ‘named argument’ feature, allows you to only adjust the state you want to change 😃\nval fred = jack.copy(name = \"Fred\")\nfred: Person(name=Fred, age=42)\nMoreover, use data classes for domain-related classes whenever possible. Their immutable nature ensures a safe, concise, and hassle-free experience when working with your application’s core.     \nTip: Prefer Immutable over Mutable Collections\nImmutable Collections have clear benefits regarding thread-safety, can be safely passed around, and are easier to reason about. Although Java collections offer some immutability features for Collections, their usage is dangerous because it easily causes exceptions at runtime:\nJava\nList.of(1,2,3).add(4); ❌unsafe 😬! .add(...) compiles, but throws UnsupportedOperationException\nKotlin\n//The default collections in Kotlin are immutable (read-only)\nlistOf(1,2,3).add(4);  //✅safe: does not compile\n\nval l0 = listOf(1,2,3) \nval l1 = l0 + 4 //✅safe: it will return a new list containing the added element\nl1 shouldBe listOf(1,2,3,4) //✅\nThe same applies for using Collections.unmodifiableList(...), which is not only unsafe, but also requires extra allocation:\nJava\nclass PersonRepo {\n   private final List<Person> cache = new ArrayList<>();\n   // Java – must clone or wrap every call\n   public List<Person> getItems() {\n       return Collections.unmodifiableList(cache);   //⚠️extra alloc\n   }\n}\n\n//Usage\npersonRepo.getItems().add(joe) ❌unsafe 😬! .add(...) can be called but throws UnsupportedOperationException\nKotlin\nclass PersonRepo {\n\n//The need to type ‘mutable’ for mutable collections is intentional: Kotlin wants you to use immutable ones by default. But sometimes you need them:\n\n   private val cache: MutableList<Person> = mutableListOf<Person>()\n\n   fun items(): List<Person> = cache //✅safe: though the underlying collection is mutable, by returning it as its superclass List<...>, it only exposes the read-only interface\n\n}\n\n//Usage\npersonRepo.items().add(joe) //✅safe:😬! Does not compile\nWhen it comes to concurrency, immutable data structures, including collections, should be preferred. In Java, more effort is required with special Collections that offer a different or limited API, like CopyOnWriteArrayList. In Kotlin, on the other hand, the read-only List<...> does the job for almost all use cases. \nIf you need mutable, Thread-Safe Collections, Kotlin offers Persistent Collections (persistentListOf(...), persistentMapOf(...)), which all share the same powerful interface.\nJava\nConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> persons = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();\npersons.put(\"Alice\", 23);\npersons.put(\"Bob\",   21);\n\n//not fluent and data copying going on\nMap<String, Integer> incPersons = new HashMap<>(persons.size());\npersons.forEach((k, v) -> incPersons.put(k, v + 1));\n\n//wordy and data copying going on\npersons\n   .entrySet()\n   .stream()\n   .forEach(entry -> \n      entry.setValue(entry.getValue() + 1));\nKotlin\npersistentMapOf(\"Alice\" to 23, \"Bob\" to 21)\n         .mapValues { (key, value) -> value + 1 } //✅same rich API like any other Kotlin Map type and not data copying going on\nPitfall 7: Keeping on using builders (or even worse: trying to use Lombok) \nTip: Use named arguments.\nBuilders are very common in Java. Although they are convenient, they add extra code, are unsafe, and increase complexity. In Kotlin, they are of no use, as a simple language feature renders them obsolete: named arguments. \nJava\npublic record Person(String name, int age) {\n\n   // Builder for Person\n   public static class Builder {\n       private String name;\n       private int age;\n\n       public Builder() {}\n\n       public Builder name(String name) {\n           this.name = name;\n           return this;\n       }\n\n       public Builder age(int age) {\n           this.age = age;\n           return this;\n       }\n\n       public Person build() {\n           return new Person(name, age);\n       }\n   }\n}\n\n//Usage\nnew JPerson.Builder().name(\"Jack\").age(36).build(); //compiles and succeeds at runtime\n\nnew JPerson.Builder().age(36).build(); //❌unsafe 😬: compiles but fails at runtime.\nKotlin\ndata class Person(val name: String, val age: Int = 0)\n\n//Usage - no builder, only named arguments.\nPerson(name = \"Jack\") //✅safe: if it compiles, it always succeeds at runtime\nPerson(name = \"Jack\", age = 36) //✅\n2. Extend/convert an existing Java application\nIf you have no greenfield option for trying out Kotlin, adding new Kotlin features or whole Kotlin modules to an existing Java codebase is the way to go. Thanks to Kotlin’s seamless Java interoperability, you can write Kotlin code that looks like Java to Java callers. This approach allows for:\nGradual migration without big-bang rewrites\nReal-world testing of Kotlin in your specific context\nBuilding team confidence with production Kotlin code\nRather than starting somewhere, consider these different approaches:\nOutside-in:\nStart in the “leaf” section of your application, e.g. controller, batch job, etc. and then work your way towards the core domain. This will give you the following advantages: \nCompile-time isolation: Leaf classes rarely have anything depending on them, so you can flip them to Kotlin and still build the rest of the system unchanged.\nFewer ripple edits. A converted UI/controller can call existing Java domain code with almost no changes thanks to seamless interop.\nSmaller PRs, easier reviews. You can migrate file-by-file or feature-by-feature.\nInside-out:\nStarting at the core and then moving to the outer layers is often a riskier approach, as it compromises the advantages of the outside-in approach mentioned above. However, it is a viable option in the following cases:\nVery small or self-contained core. If your domain layer is only a handful of POJOs and services, flipping it early may be cheap and immediately unlock idiomatic constructs (data class, value classes, sealed hierarchies).\nRe-architecting anyway. If you plan to refactor invariants or introduce DDD patterns (value objects, aggregates) while you migrate, it’s sometimes cleaner to redesign the domain in Kotlin first.\nStrict null-safety contracts. Putting Kotlin at the center turns the domain into a “null-safe fortress”; outer Java layers can still send null, but boundaries become explicit and easier to police.\n\n\n\n\n\nModule by module\nIf your architecture is organized by functionality rather than layers, and the modules have a manageable size, converting them one by one is a good strategy.\nLanguage features for converting Java to Kotlin\nKotlin offers a variety of features – primarily annotations – that allow your Kotlin code to behave like native Java. This is especially valuable in hybrid environments where Kotlin and Java coexist within the same codebase.\nKotlin\nclass Person @JvmOverloads constructor(val name: String,\n                          var age: Int = 0) {\n  companion object {\n\n  @JvmStatic\n  @Throws(InvalidNameException::class)\n  fun newBorn(name: String): Person = if (name.isEmpty()) \n       throw InvalidNameException(\"name not set\")\n     else Person(name, 0)\n\n   @JvmField\n   val LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(KPerson.javaClass)\n  }\n}\nJava\n//thanks to @JvmOverloads an additional constructor is created, propagating Kotlin’s default arguments to Java\nvar john =  new Person(\"John\");\n\n//Kotlin automatically generates getters (val) and setters (var) for Java\njohn.setAge(23);\nvar name = ken.getName();\n\n//@JvmStatic and @JvmField all accessing (companion) object fields and methods as statics in Java\n\n//Without @JvmStatic it would be: Person.Companion.newBorn(...)\nvar ken =  Person.newBorn(\"Ken\"); \n\n//Without @JvmField it would be: Person.Companion.LOG\nPerson.LOG.info(\"Hello World, Ken ;-)\");\n\n//@Throws(...) will put the checked Exception in the method signature \ntry {\n  Person ken =  Person.newBorn(\"Ken\");\n} catch (InvalidNameException e) {\n  //…\n}\nKotlin\n@file:JvmName(\"Persons\")\npackage org.abc\n\n@JvmName(\"prettyPrint\")\n\nfun Person.pretty() =\n      Person.LOG.info(\"$name is $age old\")\nJava\n//@JvmName for files and methods makes accessing static fields look like Java: without it would be: PersonKt.pretty(...)\nPersons.prettyPrint(ken)\nIntelliJ IDEA’s Java to Kotlin Converter\nIntelliJ IDEA offers a Java to Kotlin Converter, so theoretically, the tool can do it for you. However, the resulting code is far from perfect, so use it only as a starting point. From there, convert it to a more Kotlin-esque representation. More on this topic will be discussed in the final section of this blog post series: Success Factors for Large-Scale Kotlin Adoption.\nTaking Java as a starting point will most likely make you write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits, but will not unleash the power of Kotlin’s potential. Therefore, writing a new application is the approach I prefer. \nNext in the series\nThis installment in our Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment series of blog posts demonstrated how Kotlin experiments can evolve into production code. Our next post focuses on the human side of adoption: convincing your peers. It explains how to present clear, code-driven arguments, guide new developers, and create a small but lasting Kotlin community within your team.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

In this month, we are bringing you improvements to model choices, agentic flows, and chat thread management. \n\n \nNew Models \nWe now have Claude Sonnet 4.5  and Claude Haiku 4.5 available in the chat window. This means the latest innovations for driving your agentic workflows is right at your fingertips. \nMemories \n\nFor Copilot to work effectively for your unique team and repository, it needs to learn about your project and team best practices. Copilot memories enable Copilot to understand and apply your project’s specific coding standards, making it project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nHow Copilot memories work \nMemories use intelligent detection to understand your team’s preferences as you prompt in the chat. That means, as you prompt how you normally would, Copilot is looking for instances where you correct its behavior, explicitly indicate a standard, or ask it to remember something. When detected, you’ll see a confirmation nudge to save the preference. Copilot will then categorize the preference into one of three files: \n.editorconfig for coding standards \nCONTRIBUTING.md for best practices, guidelines, architectural standards, etc. \nand README.md for high level project information \nSo, as you prompt, you’re not only teaching Copilot how to respond better to you in the future, but you’re also helping out your team by documenting your development best practices, and augmenting their future Copilot responses as well! \nPlanning \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\n\nCopilot Chat now includes built-in planning to help guide large, multi-step tasks.  \nWhen you ask a complex question, Copilot automatically creates a markdown plan file with: \nA task list  \nThe files it plans to edit  \nContext for its approach \nAs it works, Copilot updates the plan in real time – tracking progress, adapting to blockers, and keeping its logic transparent. \nPlanning is fully visible, scoped to your goal, and implemented through tool calling, making behavior more predictable, reliable, and easy to follow. \nTry it out: Ask Copilot to refactor a component, add a new feature, or fix bugs across multiple files. \n Plan files are temporary by default. To reuse or share them across threads, save the file into your repo. \nTo learn more about planning or share your feedback, check out the blog post. \nInstruction Files \n\nGetting Copilot to respond the way you want can be a challenge. You may have different coding standards, best practices, or architectural patterns in different areas of your codebase. With instruction files, you can now target specific instructions to specific folders or files in your repository, making Copilot truly project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nEnable the feature \nTurn on the feature at Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat > Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files and added to requests. \nWrite instruction files \nFormat your instructions with the applyTo header and specify a glob pattern for which files you want these instructions to be included for. \n--- \n \napplyTo: \"src/**/*.cs\" \n \n---\nIn the file body, you can use natural language to specify your content and reference other instruction files to compose instructions together.  \nSave the file with the .instructions.md file extension in the root of your repository in the .github/instructions folder. \nTip: You can even get Copilot’s help refining your instructions to be more detailed. \nHow it works \nWhen you prompt Copilot, it will automatically detect which instruction files apply to the files in your current context and attach them as references. You can see which instructions were attached by clicking on the references in the response card. \nBring Your Own Model with Azure Foundry\nWant the ultimate layer of control over which models you’re using in GitHub Copilot Chat? Try out the new Azure Foundry integration to bring your own models.\nChat Management \nWe’ve got two new commands available for managing your chat threads, /clear and /clearAll.  \n/clear – Use this when you’ve encountered any issues with your current chat conversation and would like to easily start fresh. \n/clearAll – Use this when you’ve got a ton of old threads hanging around that you don’t need any more, and it will clear all of them from your history – making it easier to find what you’re looking for next time. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything in Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions. \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Visual Studio October Update – new models, memories, planning, and more appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 마케팅, 개발, 콘텐츠 제작 등 각 분야 전문가들이 엄선한 프롬프트들을 제공하여, 복사-붙여넣기만으로 AI 생산성을 획기적으로 높여주는 비결을 담고 있습니다. 지금 바로 여러분의 AI 활용 능력을 한 단계 업그레이드할 기회를 잡으세요!\n\n\n\n \"오늘 날씨 어때?\" 같은 간단한 질문을 넘어, 인공지능(AI)을 정말 '일 잘하는 동료'처럼 활용하고 싶으신가요? 아마 많은 분이 AI 채팅창을 열었을 때, 무엇을 어떻게 질문해야 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있을지 막막했던 경험을 해보셨을 거예요. 제 주변에도 이런 고민을 하는 분들이 정말 많더라고요.\n맞아요, 좋은 질문이 좋은 답변을 만듭니다. 솔직히 저도 AI와 씨름하면서 '이게 최선인가?'라는 생각을 자주 했었거든요. 하지만 이제는 그럴 필요가 없습니다. 바로 이 지점에서 여러분의 AI 활용 능력을 극적으로 향상시켜 줄 비밀 무기, 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'를 소개합니다. 2025년, AI 시대의 생산성 혁명은 바로 여기에서 시작됩니다.\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'가 왜 지금 필요한가요?\n우리가 AI를 사용하는 목적은 단순히 정보 검색을 넘어, 아이디어를 얻거나, 콘텐츠를 만들거나, 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 처리하는 데 있습니다. 그런데 막상 AI와 대화하다 보면 원하는 답변을 얻기까지 수많은 시행착오를 겪기 마련이죠. 이런 비효율적인 과정이 반복되면 결국 AI 활용 자체를 포기하게 될 수도 있습니다.\n\n\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 바로 이런 문제점에서 출발했습니다. 이 플랫폼은 단순히 프롬프트를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, 마케팅, 소프트웨어 개발, 콘텐츠 제작부터 일상생활에 이르기까지, 각 분야의 전문가들이 실제로 사용하는 실용적인 프롬프트들을 엄선하여 제공하는 보물창고입니다. 저는 이 사이트를 처음 접했을 때, '아, 드디어 AI와 제대로 대화할 수 있는 길을 찾았구나!' 하고 무릎을 탁 쳤습니다.\n  핵심 요점: 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 AI 활용의 시행착오를 줄이고, 구체적이고 효과적인 질문을 통해 사용자가 원하는 결과물을 빠르고 정확하게 얻도록 돕는 것을 목표로 합니다. AI를 더 이상 어렵게 느끼지 않도록 돕는 가장 스마트한 지름길이죠.\n  'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub' 파헤치기: 어떤 곳인가요?\n앞서 말씀드렸지만, 이곳은 일반적인 프롬프트 모음 사이트와는 차원이 다릅니다. 이 사이트의 목표는 사용자가 AI 앞에서 더 이상 망설이지 않고, 구체적이고 효과적인 질문을 통해 원하는 결과물을 얻도록 돕는 것입니다. 마치 나만의 AI 어시스턴트에게 정확한 지시를 내리는 법을 배우는 것과 같다고 할까요? 다양한 분야의 전문가들이 직접 사용하며 효과를 검증한 프롬프트들이기에 그 신뢰도는 두말할 나위가 없습니다.\n특히 흥미로운 점은, 단순히 질문 템플릿을 제공하는 것을 넘어 AI 챗봇의 정체성, 역할, 말투까지 지정할 수 있는 '챗봇 지침(Gems & GPTs)' 섹션이 있다는 거예요. 이건 정말 대단한 기능이라고 생각합니다. 나만의 전문 AI 챗봇을 만들 수 있는 가능성을 열어주는 거죠.\n  초보도 전문가처럼! '프롬프트 허브' 완벽 활용 4단계\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 직관적인 디자인 덕분에 사용법이 정말 간단합니다. 저는 처음에 혹시 어렵지 않을까 걱정했는데, 막상 사용해보니 전혀 그렇지 않더라고요! 여러분도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 핵심적인 활용법을 4단계로 나누어 자세히 알려드릴게요.\n\n\n1단계: 두 개의 보물상자, '분야별 프롬프트'와 '챗봇 지침'\n사이트에 접속하면 상단에 두 개의 주요 탭이 눈에 뜁니다. 마치 잘 정리된 서랍처럼 말이죠.\n분야별 프롬프트: 마케터, 개발자, 학생, 작가 등 누구나 일상과 업무에서 바로 사용할 수 있는 일반적인 프롬프트 200개가 모여 있습니다. 대부분의 사용자가 가장 많이 이용하게 될 메인 공간이라고 보시면 돼요. 저도 이 섹션에서 정말 많은 아이디어를 얻었습니다.\n챗봇 지침 (Gems & GPTs): 이곳은 조금 더 특별한 공간입니다. 단순한 일회성 질문이 아니라, AI 챗봇의 정체성, 역할, 말투를 지정하여 '100개의 나만의 전문 챗봇'을 만들기 위한 '시스템 지침'들이 모여있죠. 현재는 채널 멤버십 회원 전용으로, 암호를 통해 접근할 수 있다고 합니다. 이 기능은 정말 AI 활용의 게임 체인저가 될 것이라고 확신합니다.\n2단계: 나에게 꼭 맞는 프롬프트를 찾아라! 스마트 필터링\n'분야별 프롬프트' 탭을 선택하면, 마케팅, 소프트웨어 개발, 콘텐츠 제작, 비즈니스/생산성 등 다양한 카테고리 버튼이 나타납니다. 'All' 버튼을 누르면 모든 분야의 프롬프트를 한눈에 볼 수 있고요. 특정 분야(예: '디자인/창작')를 클릭하면 해당 카테고리에 속한 프롬프트만 깔끔하게 필터링되어 나타납니다. 아이콘과 함께 표시되어 원하는 분야를 쉽게 찾을 수 있어서 정말 편리합니다. 원하는 정보를 빠르게 찾을 수 있다는 건, 결국 시간 절약으로 이어진다는 뜻이겠죠!\n3단계: 마법의 버튼, '프롬프트 복사'\n마음에 드는 프롬프트를 찾으셨나요? 각 카드에는 제목과 설명, 그리고 실제 프롬프트 내용이 보기 쉽게 정리되어 있습니다. 이제 가장 편리한 기능을 사용할 차례입니다. 바로 '프롬프트 복사' 버튼이죠!\n프롬프트 아래에 있는 '프롬프트 복사' 버튼을 클릭해 보세요. 단 한 번의 클릭으로 전체 프롬프트 내용이 클립보드에 복사됩니다. 버튼이 '복사 완료!'로 바뀌는 시각적 피드백 덕분에 혼동할 염려도 전혀 없죠. 이 기능 덕분에 저도 작업 속도가 정말 빨라졌습니다. 이제 여러분이 사용하는 AI 챗봇(ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude 등)에 돌아가 붙여넣기만 하면 됩니다. 정말 쉽죠?\n4단계 (가장 중요!): 나만의 옷을 입히자! 커스터마이징의 힘\n'Prompt Hub'의 프롬프트들은 훌륭한 '템플릿'입니다. 여기서 중요한 점은, 복사한 프롬프트를 그대로 사용하기보다는 [ ] 로 표시된 부분을 여러분의 상황에 맞게 수정하여 사용하는 것이 훨씬 더 효과적이라는 겁니다.\n예를 들어, 복사한 프롬프트가 다음과 같다면:\n신제품 [제품 이름]을 홍보하기 위한 인스타그램 게시물 아이디어 5가지를 생성해 줘. 타겟 고객은 [타겟 고객 설명]이고, 목표는 참여도 증진이야. 이모지와 해시태그를 포함해 줘.\n이렇게 수정해서 질문하는 겁니다:\n신제품 '글로우업 비건 세럼'을 홍보하기 위한 인스타그램 게시물 아이디어 5가지를 생성해 줘. 타겟 고객은 '환경에 관심이 많은 20대 여성'이고, 목표는 참여도 증진이야. 이모지와 해시태그를 포함해 줘.\n이 작은 수정만으로 AI는 훨씬 더 정확하고 만족스러운 결과물을 제공할 것입니다. AI는 우리가 던지는 질문에 따라 무한한 잠재력을 보여주니까요. 마치 요리할 때 레시피를 기본으로 나만의 재료를 추가하는 것과 비슷하다고 생각하시면 돼요.\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 프롬프트를 복사한 뒤, [ ] 안의 내용을 본인의 상황에 맞게 꼭 수정하는 과정을 잊지 마세요. 이 단계가 AI의 잠재력을 최대로 끌어내고, 만족스러운 결과를 얻는 핵심 열쇠입니다. 복사-붙여넣기만으로는 100%의 효과를 보기 어렵습니다.\n✨ 이런 분들에게 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'를 강력 추천합니다!\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 정말 다양한 분야의 사람들에게 큰 도움이 될 수 있는 도구라고 생각합니다. 특히 다음과 같은 분들이라면, 이 플랫폼을 통해 업무 효율과 생산성을 2배 이상 끌어올릴 수 있을 거예요.\nAI 마케터: 바이럴 캠페인 아이디어나 광고 카피 문구, SEO 전략 수립이 막막할 때. 혹은 고객 세분화 분석 등 복잡한 마케팅 전략을 세울 때도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n개발자 & 기획자: 코드 리팩토링, API 설계 초안, 단위 테스트 케이스 생성, 아니면 복잡한 기능 요구사항을 명확하게 정리하고 싶을 때. 개발 과정의 막힌 부분을 시원하게 뚫어줄 겁니다.\n콘텐츠 크리에이터: 유튜브 스크립트 초안, 블로그 글 구성, 소설 아이디어, 심지어는 SNS 게시물 문구까지! 영감이 필요할 때마다 이 플랫폼이 든든한 조력자가 되어줄 거예요.\n학생 & 연구원: 복잡한 개념을 쉽게 이해하고 싶거나, 에세이 개요를 잡고, 논문 초록을 작성해야 할 때. 방대한 자료를 요약하는 데도 탁월한 성능을 발휘합니다.\n모든 직장인: 회의록 요약, 보고서 초안 작성, 이메일 작성, 발표 자료 구성 등 일상적인 업무를 더 빠르고 효율적으로 처리하고 싶을 때. 야근이 줄어드는 마법을 경험하실지도 모릅니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 지금까지 290개가 넘는 스타트업에 투자했다. 초기 VC가 대부분 비슷할 텐데, 이 중 75% 이상은 평생 엑싯도 못하고 그냥 언젠가는 없어질 테고, 나머지 25%에서 승부가 난다. 이 25% 중에서도 극소수만 엄청 잘 되고, 나머지는 그냥 평타를 치거나, 아니면 회사는 잘 먹고 잘사는 라이프스타일 사업이 되지만, 이런 회사는 우리 같이 수십 배의 수익을 바라보고 투자하는 VC에겐 썩 좋은 결과를 가져오진 않는다.\n뭐, 그렇다고 우리가 투자하는 회사마다 별로라는 건 아니다. 좋은 성장을 하고 있는 회사도 많고, 꽤 많은 회사가 그들이 사업을 하는 분야에서는 고객이 가장 먼저, 또는 두 번째로 떠올리는 “top of the mind” 브랜드가 됐거나 되고 있는데, 이 과정을 옆에서 꽤 가까운 곳에서 본다는 건 초기 투자자만이 가질 수 있는 특권이자 자랑이다. 이 중엔 당근, 핀다, 클래스101과 같이 상당히 큰 시장에서 누구나 다 아는 브랜드가 된 투자사도 있지만, 일반인들에겐 상대적으로 낯선 시장에서, 그 시장에 종사하는 관계자라면 누구나 다 아는 브랜드가 된 투자사도 있다.\n이건 내가 말한 게 아니라 작년에 다른 분에게 들은 건데, 스트롱 투자사들은 겉으로는 요란하진 않지만, 안으로는 아주 고요하게 성장하는 회사들이 많아서 좋다는 말이었다. 즉, 본인이 지금까지 수많은 스타트업과 대표들을 봐왔는데, 소셜미디어에서 정말 요란하게 사업하고 투자 많이 받았다고 자랑하는 회사들은 결국엔 큰 사업으로 성장하지 못하지만, 오히려 조용히 좋은 제품과 매출을 만들면서 고요하게 성장하는, 한 번도 들어보지 못한 회사들이 크게 성장하는 경우가 많다고 한다. 실제로 스트롱 투자사들이 그런진 나도 잘 모르겠지만, 대부분 돈도 없고 사람도 없어서 조용히 사업에만 집중하는 건 맞는 것 같다.\n최근에 후속 투자를 유치하는 우리 투자사를 오랜만에 만났는데, 위에서 말한, 작년에 들었던 고요한 성장이라는 말이 생각났다. 대표님이 매달 이메일로 보내주는 업데이트는 잘 읽고 있지만, 직접 만나서 그동안의 사업 경과, 지표, 그리고 앞으로의 계획에 대해서 꽤 오랫동안 이야기한 건 정말 오랜만이었고, 상당히 인상 깊었던 미팅이었다. 고요한 성장을 하고 있는 딱 그런 회사였기 때문이다.\n일단 이 회사가 사업하는 분야는 대부분의 투자자나 일반인들은 잘 모르는 산업이다. 우리도 처음 만났을 때, “와, 한국에도 이런 시장이 있구나.”라는 생각을 할 정도로 잘 안 알려진 시장이었다. 그런데 이렇게 잘 안 알려진 시장이라고 하면, 대부분 아주 작은 틈새시장을 떠올리는데, 이 시장은 전혀 작지 않은, 전 세계적으로 수십조 원 되는, 아무도 모르지만, 아는 사람만 아는 엄청나게 큰 틈새시장이다.\n이 시장에서 우리 투자사는 수년 동안 진흙탕에서 굴렀고, 그동안 솔직히 망할 뻔한 순간도 몇 번 있었다. 하지만, 그때마다 회사는 절대로 죽지 않고 매번 더 강하게 살아남는 바퀴벌레처럼 버티고 또 버텼다. 그러면서 그 분야에서 계속 자기만의 영토를 야금야금 만들었고, 자신의 브랜드도 조금씩 만들기 시작했다. 다른 회사들이 투자자들의 돈으로 요란하게 사업하고 있을 때, 이 회사는 아주 조용히 제품을 만들었고, 고객을 확보했고, 매출을 만들었고, 심지어 수출까지 시작했다.\n나는 이렇게 묵묵히 자기 할 일만 하면서 요란하지 않고 고요하게 성장하는 회사들이 제일 좋다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "몇 주 전에 어떤 해외 투자자를 서울에서 꽤 오랜만에 만났다. 요새 스트롱벤처스의 현황과 우리가 어떤 창업가들을 만나고 있는지에 대해 업데이트했고, 한국 시장에 대해서 내가 그동안 보고, 듣고, 느낀 점들을 공유해줬다. 이야기 도중 이분이 나에게 한국의 계엄 사태에 관한 이야기를 꺼냈고, 2025년 절반은 우리가 국가의 리더가 없었다고 이야기했는데, 그때 내 반응은 “아, 맞다. 한국에 그런 일이 있었지…” 였다. 나는 완전히 이 일들에 대해 잠시 잊어버리고 있었고, 별생각을 하지 않고 있었던 것이다.\n이분의 회사는 본사가 미국이고, 싱가폴에 아시아 지사가 있는데, 이분은 싱가폴 지사에서 일하는 파트너이다. 얼마 전에 미국 본사의 나이 든 파트너들과 한국 벤처 시장에 대해서 이야기하는데, “한국은 아직도 전시 국가이고, 북한이 계속 미사일을 쏘고 있는데, 한국 시장에 투자하는 게 너무 위험한 게 아닌가요?”라는 질문이 나왔다고 한다. 이 말을 듣자마자 내 반응은 계엄 사태와 비슷하게 “아, 맞다. 우린 아직 북한이 미사일을 쏘고 있지…” 였다. 실은 이것도 잠시 잊어버리고 있었고, 별로 생각하지 않고 있었던 것이다. 그리고 결국 이 회사는 한국의 정치와 국방 리스크가 조금 더 해소되면 한국 벤처 시장을 조금 더 깊게 보자는 결론을 내렸다고 한다.\n그런데 이분이 나에게 그다음에 한 이야기가 더 재미있다. 한국의 이런 리스크에 대해서 내부적으로 이야기하고, 한국에 오랜만에 왔는데, 막상 와보니까 나라는 너무나 잘 돌아가고 있어서 놀랐다고 한다. 항상 그렇듯이, 한국인들은 아주 역동적이고 강렬한 삶을 살고 있고, 비즈니스는 그 어느 때보다 더 잘 되는 것 같고, 우리 같은 VC들도 너무나 활발하게 투자하고 있어서, 이 나라가 과연 본인들이 몇 주 전에 정치와 국방 리스크가 있다고 당분간 투자하지 말자고 내부적으로 결정했던 그 나라가 맞는지 의아해했다. 그리고 미국 본사의 파트너들에게 그들이 걱정하는 것과 달리 한국은 잘 있고, 한국인들은 평상시와 같이 잘 살고 있고, 한국 시장도 아주 좋다는 걸 어떻게 설득해야 할지 고민하고 있었다.\n제삼자를 통해서 보고 듣는 이야기와, 내가 직접 그 현장에서 보고 듣는 이야기가 다르기 때문이다. 솔직히 한국의 정치적인 상황이나 북한의 위협은 내가 종사하고 있는 실제 투자 현장에 큰 영향을 미치지 못하는 내용인데, 한국에 와보지도 않고 외신을 통해서 한국의 소식을 접하면 우리나라에서 당장 전쟁이 나고, 정치적으로도 완전히 무너질 거라는 생각을 하게 된다. 실은 위에서 말 한 분 뿐만이 아니라, 이런 이유로 올해는 아예 한국에 투자하지 않겠다고 선언한 투자자들도 있는데, 이들이 한국이라는 현장에 와서 직접 시장 돌아가는 걸 보면 생각이 많이 바뀔 것이다.\n우린 실제로 어떤 시장, 회사, 인물에 대해서 잘 모르면서, 소문이나 “~카더라” 이야기, 정확하지 않은 기사, 근거 없는 소셜미디어의 내용만을 기반으로 판단하는데, 이렇게 하면 틀린 결정을 하고, 이로 인해 좋은 기회를 놓칠 가능성이 높다. 위에서 말 한 투자자가 한국의 벤처 시장에 지금 투자하지 않음으로써 몇 년 후에 큰돈을 벌 수 있는 기회를 놓치는 것과 비슷하게.\n정답은 항상 현장에 존재한다. 현장에 가서 보고, 듣고, 이야기하고, 직접 판단해야 한다.",

ISA 계좌나 연금 계좌에서도 투자할 수 있는 국내 투자운용사의 금현물 ETF 등은 투자가 쉬우면서 인플레이션 방어 역할을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n(3) 대출금 상환 우선순위 설정하기\n금리가 내려가면 대출 이자가 줄어들어 숨통이 트일 수 있지만, 부채가 많다면 우선 갚는 게 최선입니다. 특히 금리가 높은 신용대출 상환은 최우선순위로 둬야 하고요. 금리가 오를 때는 변동금리 대출의 부담이 커지므로, 저금리 시기에 미리 갚거나 고정금리로 바꿔두는 게 안전합니다. 매달 일정 비율을 정해 꾸준히 상환하고, 보너스나 여윳돈이 생기면 추가로 갚아나가면 부채 관리가 조금 더 수월해질 수 있어요.\n물가와 금리는 서로 맞물리며 경제의 큰 균형을 만들어 갑니다. 금리가 오르고 내리는 과정은 결국 과열을 식히고, 또 침체를 막으며 경제가 스스로 균형을 찾아가는 흐름이 반복되는 거예요. 그 안에서 우리는 때론 불안에 떨고, 때론 기회를 기대하기도 합니다. 투자자로서 이 파도 같은 변동성에 휩쓸리지 않으려면 길게 보는 안목과 인내심을 가져야 합니다. 그리고 자산을 분산 투자하고, 주기적인 리밸런싱을 통해 포트폴리오를 점검하며 시장의 흐름에 유연하게 대응하는 게 중요합니다. 이렇게 하면 금리와 물가의 파동 속에서도 자산을 지켜내고 성장시킬 수 있습니다.\n경제는 늘 변하지만, 물가와 금리가 가리키는 신호를 이해하면 변동성은 두려움의 대상이 아니라 기회의 신호입니다. 우리가 경제를 공부하는 건 이 거대한 흐름 속에서 흔들리지 않고 내 자산을 지키기 위한 것이라는 점을 기억하세요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 이제현",

(대표적인 예: 유기농 레몬즙, 리들샷, 니트 원피스 등…)\nSNS로 타인의 삶을 실시간으로 빠르게 스캔할 수 있는 요즘, 따라하고 싶은 멋진 취향은 도처에 널려 있다. 그만큼 디토 소비의 규모는 갈수록 더 크고 다양해지는 추세다. 100만 유튜버가 추천한 맛집, 유명 연예인이 감명 깊게 읽은 책, 헐리웃 스타가 자주 쓰는 텀블러 등은 소문이 나는 순간 오픈런 필수·베스트셀러·품절템이 되는 세상이다.\n독일 베를린에 갔을 때는 말차라떼가 한창 유행이었다. 인플루언서들의 후기를 타고 전 세계에 말차 열풍이 불고 있다는 소리는 얼핏 들었는데, 베를린 카페에서 젊은 여성들이 들고 있는 음료 대부분이 정말 말차라떼였던 것이다. 괜히 나도 평소 한국에선 잘 안 마시지도 않던 말차라떼를 두어 번 주문해 봤다. 맛은 예상한 그대로였지만 내게 중요한 건 ‘나도 그들처럼 해봤다’는 경험이었다.\n\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}인스타그램에서 본 베를린 필하모닉 공연을 보러 가 샴페인을 마시고, 유행한다는 말차라떼를 마시며 민음사TV가 추천한 책을 읽고, 챗GPT가 추천한 ‘여기서 꼭 사야 하는 기념품’을 사는 동안 내가 쌓은 취향의 탑은 무슨 모양일까.\n’나도 할래’가 취향이 되는 순간\n디토 소비는 이렇듯 타인의 취향을 사는 행위다. 작년 초쯤 팔로워 10만 명 이하인 마이크로 인플루언서 시장에 대해 취재한 적이 있다. 그때 들은 이야기 하나가 떠오른다. 과거 SNS 사용자들이 특정 계정을 팔로우하는 기준은 대체로 ‘인맥’이었다. 하지만 이 기준이 요새는 ‘취향’으로 바뀌었다. 메가 급 인플루언서는 아닐지라도 내 취향과 결이 맞는 마이크로 인플루언서들을 팔로우하며 소비도 이들을 따라가고 있다는 것이다. 이 경향성이 점차 더 강해지고 있는 이유에 대해 취재 당시 이야기를 나눴던 권정윤 서울대 소비트렌드분석센터 연구위원은 “정보가 넘쳐나는 시대일수록 사람들은 물건 하나를 사더라도 신뢰할 수 있는 안목을 가진 누군가가 불필요한 정보를 걸러주거나 검증해주길 원한다”고 설명했다.\n하긴 가방 하나, 청바지 하나 사려고 해도 수많은 사이트에 수백 수천 개의 제품이 뜬다. 책 《도둑맞은 집중력》에서는 매일 한 사람에게 쏟아지는 정보의 양이 174종의 신문을 읽는 수준에 맞먹는다고 소개한다. 정보가 많아도 너무 많아서 개별 정보에 일일이 집중할 시간이 없다. 영향력 있는 인물이 이미 검증을 마친 ‘추천템’을 사는 게 시간은 아끼고, 실패할 확률은 줄이면서 트렌드도 따라갈 수 있는 가장 효율적인 방법이다. 수많은 정보 속에서 헤매지 않고 옳은 선택을 하게 만드는 지름길인 것이다.\n그래서일까. 주인공의 패션과 머리스타일, 행동 등을 음침하게 따라 하던 웹툰 〈치즈인더트랩〉의 캐릭터 이름을 본뜬 유행어 ‘손민수하다’도 디토 소비의 트렌드를 따라 예전보다 부정적인 뉘앙스를 많이 벗은 듯하다. 패션 커머스 플랫폼 에이블리는 브랜드 마케팅 콘텐츠로 ‘탑 아이돌 코디 손민수하기’ ‘손민수처럼 복붙하고 싶은 스타일’ 등을 제목으로 내세워 소비자들을 끌어 모으기도 한다. 얼마 전 대학원 동기들끼리 모인 저녁 자리에서도 한 지인이 다른 지인에게 “폰케이스 예쁘다. 나 이거 손민수해도 됨?”이라고 묻는 소리를 들었다. 아무렇지 않게 고개를 끄덕이던 폰케이스 주인을 보며 비슷한 소비 형태들도 시대에 따라 다른 얼굴을 띄게 된다는 걸 새삼 느낀 순간이었다.\n혹자는 이걸 ‘주체적인 소비가 아니다’ ‘개성이 사라지고 있다’며 비판할지 모르겠다. 하지만 꼭 그런 측면을 부각해 이 트렌드를 보고 싶지는 않다. 따지고 보면 세대별로 향유하고 기억하는 패션이나 문화 트렌드의 아이콘이 각기 다르듯, 그 시대 가장 멋져 보이는 누군가의 취향을 모방하는 건 과거부터 늘 존재해 왔다.\n오히려 따라하고 싶은 아이콘이 비교적 소수였던 그때와 달리 현재 디토 소비의 아이콘들은 SNS와 각종 플랫폼을 타며 더 개인화·세분화되고 있다. 최근 인스타그램을 통해 재사용 소재 가방 브랜드를 알게 돼 구매한 적이 있다. 그러다가 또 다른 브랜드의 정보를 얻고, 새로운 인플루언서를 내 팔로우 목록에 추가하기도 했다. 동물권을 보호하는 소비 자체에 대해서도 자연스럽게 관심이 생겼다. 디토 소비를 따라 찍히는 내 발자국 하나하나가 내 취향과 개성을 반영하고, 또 새롭게 만들어주고 있었다. 과거보다 우리의 면면은 넓디넓은 디토 소비의 선택지 속에서 한층 더 다채로워졌을 수 있다는 이야기다.\n디토 소비, 반품과 라이프스타일 사이\n물론 그럼에도 어딘가에 찜찜함이 남는 이유는 디토 소비가 만드는 과잉 소비의 굴레 때문일 것이다. 디토를 이끄는 주요 동력 중 무시할 수 없는 요소는 ‘나는 이렇게 제법 멋진 취향을 가진 사람이야’라는 걸 보여주고 싶은 과시욕, 이와 동시에 ‘트렌드에서 뒤처질지 모른다’는 두려움이다. 바야흐로 클릭이나 터치 몇 번으로 물건을 구매하는 시대다. 순간의 감정에 동해 ‘나도 살래’를 얼마나 쉽게 실천할 수 있는지 우리는 모두 잘 알고 있다. 언제 샀는지 기억조차 잘 나지 않는 처치 불가의 플라스틱 덩어리들을 얼마나 자주 마주했던가.\n책 《디컨슈머》에 따르면 현재 전 세계는 지구가 재생할 수 있는 속도보다 1.7배 빠른 속도로 지구의 자원을 소모하고 있다. 인간이 만든 물건들의 무게는 지구상 모든 생명체의 무게를 뛰어넘은 지 오래다. 알리익스프레스·테무 등 중국산 이커머스 플랫폼들의 국내 상륙과 함께 유행한 ‘테무깡’ 콘텐츠가 떠오른다. 말도 안 되는 저가의 상품을 대량 구매한 뒤 하나씩 언박싱하며 후기를 공유하는 이 콘텐츠에서 재미 요소는 ‘뽑기 실패’다. 쉽게 사는 물건은 버리기도 쉽다. 어차피 저렴하게 샀으니 반품하기 귀찮으면 바로 쓰레기통 행이다.\n이 테무깡·알리깡 콘텐츠의 유행을 보며 무엇을 소비하느냐의 문제를 넘어 소비하는 행위 그 자체도 디토가 될 수 있겠다는 생각을 했었다. 그 파급력은 과거의 디토와는 차원이 다른 파급력일 것이다. ‘나도 살래’ 한 번이 지구 어딘가에 부담을 남기고 있다는 사실을 직시한다면 결코 가볍게만 볼 수 없는 일이다.\n글로벌 브랜드 리바이스의 글로벌 혁신 담당 부사장 폴 딜린저는 코로나가 발생하기 훨씬 전 “의류 산업은 불필요한 소비 위에 세워져 있다”고 선언한 바 있다. 옷을 구매하려는 소비자들의 욕구가 끝없이 늘어날수록 그 옷을 만드는 데 필요한 자원은 언젠가 소진될 거라는 이야기였다. 그래서 그는 리바이스에 더 위협이 되는 건 사람들이 옷을 적게 사는 게 아니라 오히려 그 반대라고 주장했다.\n얼마 전 나의 모친은 미국 여행을 다녀온 지인으로부터 그 유명한 ‘트레이더 조Trader Joe’s’의 미니 에코백을 선물로 받았다. 내가 그 에코백이 최근 얼마나 유행이었는지 설명하며 수선을 부리자 모친은 “이게? 왜?”라고 되물었다. 인플루언서들 사이에서 입소문이 난 후 리셀 사이트에서 정가의 수백 배 가격에 판매될 정도로 인기를 끌었을지언정 이걸 모르는 이에게는 그냥 다른 에코백과 똑같은 에코백일 뿐이었다. 물론 모친은 그 이후로 트레이더 조 에코백을 외출용 가방으로 아주 잘 활용하고 계신다. 결국 무엇을 소비하든, 그게 디토든 아니든 간에 중요한 건 ‘내게 필요한 게 무엇인지 정확히 알고 소비하는 삶’을 살고 있느냐에 달려 있다고 본다. 그게 이 복잡다단한 소비의 딜레마 속에서 내가 내린 아주 단순한 결론이다.\n이런 건 어떤가. 개인적으로 디토 소비의 핵심이 특정 인물의 취향을 모방하고 추종하는 것에 있다면, 물질적인 것들에 대한 취향뿐 아니라 그 사람이 소비할 때 추구하는 가치나 방향에 대한 디토 소비도 더 주목받았으면 하는 바람이 있다. 예를 하나 들자면 며칠 전 유튜브 알고리즘에 걸려 우연히 연예인 크리스탈의 ‘왓츠 인 마이 백’ 영상을 봤는데, 10년 이상 쓴 보드게임·티셔츠·헤드셋 등 각종 소품들을 소개하는 그의 모습이 새삼 멋지게 다가왔다. 이 모습에 이끌려 내가 ‘물건을 한 번 사면 최대한 오랫동안 사용하는 소비 습관’을 따라하게 된다면 역시 디토 소비의 일종 아닐까. 선택지는 다양하다. ‘무엇을 살까’보다 ‘어떻게 살까’를 따라하는 소비까지 고민해 본다면, 우리 각자의 디토는 단순한 유행 추종을 넘어 더 많은 의미를 담게 될지도 모른다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 시시킴\n✱커버 그래픽: SNS 안에서 인플루언서들의 취향을 쇼핑하듯 둘러보며, ‘나와 닮은 취향’을 찾아가는 디토소비의 모습을 감각적으로 표현했습니다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n🔗 〈2025 토스픽〉 공유 이벤트\n\n소중한 사람에게 이 글을 공유해 보세요. \n⓵ 공유 버튼을 눌러 복사된 링크를 메신저, 블로그, SNS 등 원하는 채널로 공유하고, \n⓶ 공유한 화면을 캡처해 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스피드 인스타그램(@toss_feed) DM으로 보내면 참여 완료. \n매월 일상에 즐거움을 더해주는 선물을 준비했어요.  \n✱자세한 이벤트 선물과 참여 안내는 여기(링크)를 참고하세요.",

'성장 우선주의'의 산업화 시대를 거치며 간과해온 가치에 다시 주목하기 시작했죠. 인류가 훼손한 환경과 동물의 존엄성, 미래 세대를 고려하지 않은 무분별한 발전에 대한 반성과 저항 문화가 생긴 것입니다.\n새로운 시대적 가치를 비즈니스 모델로 정립한 브랜드가 소비자의 선택을 받기 시작했습니다. 친환경 유기농을 내세운 식품 기업 ‘홀푸드(Whole Foods)’, 환경과 지속 가능성을 최우선 가치로 생각하는 ‘파타고니아(Patagonia)’, 재활용 소재를 활용하고 탄소 발자국을 공개하는 신발 브랜드 ‘올버즈(Allbirds)’, 동물 실험 반대와 최소 포장을 강력하게 내세우는 코스메틱 브랜드 ‘러쉬(Lush)’ 등의 사례가 대표적입니다. 이 브랜드를 ‘선택’하는 행위를 통해 소비자는 자신의 가치관을 보여주게 됐습니다. 본격적인 ‘가치 소비’가 시작된 것이죠.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}간편하고

사례에서 볼 수 있는 것처럼 말이죠. 브랜드가 공감 가능한 가치 자체에 뿌리를 두고 있는지, 그리고 전문성과 결합해 신뢰 가능한 브랜드인지가 중요해졌습니다.\n결국, 소비자가 선택하는 브랜드는 '내가 지향하는 세상'을 실현하는 도구가 됩니다. 내가 중요하게 여기는 가치를 브랜드가 더 확산시켜 주기를 기대하며, 이를 통해 더 나은 세상, 더 나은 미래가 되길 희망합니다. 우리는 지갑을 열 때마다 ‘소비’라는 투표용지를 던짐으로써, 그 가치가 시장의 주류가 되도록 힘을 실어줍니다. 미래의 시장은 진정성과 전문성이라는 진심과 실력을 기반으로 소비자의 ‘가치 투표권’을 획득하는 브랜드가 끌어나갈 것입니다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px

소비문화가 시장을 이끌었죠. 하지만 개인의 문화 자본이 경제 자본으로 전환되고, 취향의 세분화로 ‘틈새 니즈’가 발생하며 1인 기업, 인플루언서, 장인형 소상공인이 많아졌습니다. 그리고 이 인디 브랜드가 시장의 핵심 플레이어가 되기 시작했습니다.\n인디 브랜드의 확대는 디지털을 통해 나의 취향을 스트리밍할 수 있게 된 덕분이 큽니다. 사회학자 유승호는 《취향의 경제》 에서 지식과 정보에 쉽게 접근할 수 있는 시대가 됐고, 유튜브나 인스타그램 등 이른바 ‘대중 자아 기술’이 확대되면서 다양한 기회가 일반 대중에게도 열렸다고 말했죠. 기록과 채집이 취향을 증명했고, 경제 자본으로 전환되며 사회적 지위를 획득했습니다.\n취향은 이제 생계 수단으로도 확고히 자리매김했습니다. 시장 개척자의 지위, 동일 취향인과의 네트워크 효과, 그리고 팬과의 끈끈한 관계 덕분에 이들은 평균 이상의 높은 수익을 획득할 수 있게 됐죠. 그 결과, 취향을 기반으로 한 인디 브랜드도 충분히 자본을 창출할 수 있게 되었으며, 우리는 이를 ‘덕업일치’에 성공했다고 부릅니다. 좋아하는 ‘취향’이 곧 ‘직업’이 된 것입니다.\n인디 브랜드의 ‘연대’와 ‘협업’도 활성화되고 있습니다. 핫플레이스나 플랫폼은 다양한 인디 브랜드가 모여 뚜렷한 정체성을 획득한 곳이 많습니다. 인디 브랜드가 공동체를 만들면 규모의 경제를 이루고 주목도를 높이며 지속 가능성을 획득할 수 있죠. 앞으로 인디 브랜드의 성장과 더불어 인디 브랜드 간 ‘합종연횡’ 연대도 더 강화될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n엣시(Etsy)의 수공예 작가들: 전 세계

틔우는 경험:브랜드 경험을 설계하다\n경험은 취향을 발생시키고 발전하게 만드는 가장 큰 원동력입니다. 직접 겪어보면서 ‘호불호’를 판단하고, 취향으로 삼을지 결정하게 됩니다. 그래서 브랜드는 ‘차별화된 경험’을 소비자에게 제공하기 위해 치열하게 고민 중입니다. 경험이야말로 내 브랜드를 ‘취향’으로 만들 수 있는 가장 핵심적인 무기이기 때문입니다.\n소비자에게 경험을 파는 방향은 크게 3가지 방향으로 이뤄집니다.\n\n차별화된 경험\n희소한 경험\n소유 경험\n\n차별화된 경험은 경쟁 브랜드가 쉽게 모방할 수 없는 브랜드의 ‘핵심 자산’이 됩니다. 특히, 이 경험이 소비자에게 감동이나 깊은 만족감, 또는 소속감을 선사할 때, 단순한 제품 소비를 넘어 '나만의 브랜드'라는 애착을 형성합니다. 이러한 진정성 있는 경험을 통해 브랜드를 취향으로 받아들인 소비자는 단순한 고객을 넘어 ‘팬’이 되죠. 팬은 자발적인 ‘확산자(Evangelist)’가 되어 브랜드를 적극적으로 알리고 홍보하는 역할을 맡습니다. 결국, 브랜드가 개인의 취향이 되어 지속 가능한 성장을 이루기 위해서는 '차별화된 경험'은 선택이 아닌 필수가 됐습니다.\n두 번째는 희소한 경험을 파는 것입니다. 한정판 아이템이 대표적인데요. 모두에게 허락되지 않은 희소성은 ‘브랜드 경험’의 가치를 극대화합니다. 상품에 응모 뒤 당첨된 사람만 구매할 수 있는 ‘래플(Raffle)’과 ‘드로우(Draw)’ 문화, 그리고 정가에 프리미엄을 얹어 거래가 발생하는 리셀(Resell) 마켓이 급성장한 이유가 바로 희소성에 있습니다.\n마지막은 소유 효과를 활용한 경험입니다. 소유 효과(Endowment Effect)는 단순히 소유하는 것만으로도 대상에 대해 더 우호적이고 애착 관계가 생기는 심리 현상입니다. 굿즈가 대표적입니다. 브랜드 굿즈를 소유하고 있으면 브랜드에 대한 애착과 충성이 커지죠. 브랜드가 팝업 스토어나 플래그십 스토어 등 오프라인 공간에 적극적인 것 역시, 이 소유 효과를 활용하기 위함입니다. 소비자는 이 공간에서 제품을 직접 만지고, 사용하고, 사진을 찍는 등의 행위를 통해 '잠재적인 소유 경험'을 하게 됩니다. 이러한 경험은 브랜드에 심리적인 애착이 생기게 하는 중요한 기제가 됩니다.\n경험을 파는 브랜드는 앞으로 더 큰 영향력을 발휘할 것입니다. 취향 경제에서 브랜드 자체가 취향이 될 수 있는 지름길이 바로 '경험'이기 때문이죠. 차별화되고 희소하며 소유 효과를 갖는 경험을 지속 가능하게 제공하는 브랜드가 결국 살아 남는 브랜드가 될 것입니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n뉴발란스 '런 허브(Run Hub)’: 러닝화 전문 매장에서 단돈 3,000원에 최고급 러닝화와 의류를 2시간 동안 대여해주고 짐 보관 서비스를 제공. 소비자가 제품을 직접 신고 인근 도심 러닝

사례.\n\n\n④ ‘같이’의 힘: 커뮤니티와 팬덤을 구축하다\n‘백지장도 맞들며 낫다’ 속담은 취향에도 적용됩니다. 혼자 즐기는 취향보다 ‘같이’ 즐기는 취향이 더 재밌고 즐겁죠. 취향 시대로 진입하면서 같은 취향과 관심사를 지닌 사람끼리 모인 ‘커뮤니티’가 공동체의 조직 원리로 작동했습니다. 우리의 공동체가 ‘취향’ 중심으로 바뀌게 된 것이죠.\n브랜드는 브랜드를 취향 삼은 소비자를 공동체로 묶기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. Z세대의 인기 문구 브랜드 ‘모트모트(Motemote)’는 문구를 판매하는 것을 넘어, ‘열공러’를 위한 강력한 온라인 커뮤니티를 구축한 사례로 잘 알려져 있습니다. 모트모트는 ‘모트모트 로켓단’을 만들어 서로 공부를 인증하고 격려하는 환경을 조성해 온라인에서 함께 공부하는 연대감을 형성했습니다. 유튜브 채널에서는 ‘실시간 독서실’라이브 방송으로 수많은 시청자가 함께 공부하고, 페이스 메이커 역할을 해주기도 했죠. 그 결과 소비자를 ‘열공 공동체’로서 묶어내며 ‘동기 부여’라는 강력한 가치를 만들었습니다.\n\n‘열공러’를 위한 강력한 온라인 커뮤니티를 구축하여 브랜드 충성도를 높인 모트모트 ⓒmotemote\n커뮤니티 구축 노력은 이제 업종을 불문하고 전방위적으로 펼쳐지고 있습니다. 출판사는 함께 책 읽는 사람들을 위한 북클럽을 만들었습니다. 경제 인플루언서는 투자 지식을 함께 나누는 네이버 카페를 선보였죠. 스포츠 브랜드는 러닝 클럽을 만들었고, 아웃도어 브랜드는 산을 함께 오르는 등산 클럽을 오픈했습니다. 기존에 연령·성별 기준으로 바라보던 ‘타깃 소비자’ 프레임이 ‘취향 소비자’로 바뀌었고, 같은 취향인을 모으기 위한 커뮤니티가 많아졌습니다.\n조심스럽게 예측해 보면, 커뮤니티를 가진 브랜드와 그렇지 못한 브랜드 간의 간극은 더 벌어질 것으로 생각합니다. 같은 취향을 가진 사람 간의 ‘연결’이 시장성을 만드는 규칙이 될 것입니다. 그리고 커뮤니티를 가진 브랜드는 이를 ‘팬덤’으로 발전시키기 위해 고민해야 합니다. 커뮤니티에 어떤 지속적인 가치를 줄 수 있을지, 어떻게 해야 공동체 일원이 브랜드에 자부심과 충성심을 가질 수 있을지 살펴봐야 하죠.\n데이비드 미어먼 스콧과 레이코 스콧은 『팬덤 경제학』에서 무엇이 팬덤을 구축하게 하는지를 알면, 소비자의 열정(passion)을 구매력(buying power)으로 전환하기 위한 로드맵을 그릴 수 있다고 말했습니다. 소비자의 열정을 연결하여 공동체를 만들고, 공동체가 팬덤이 되며, 팬덤이 브랜드 구매력을 만드는 로드맵이 모든 브랜드에 필요해졌습니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n룰루레몬(Lululemon): 단순히 운동복을 판매하는 것을 넘어, 매장과 지역별 앰버서더를 거점으로 요가 클래스, 러닝 클럽 등 무료 운동 이벤트를 정기적으로 개최하며 진정한 인간관계를 맺는 '커뮤니티 허브'를 지향.\nREI Co-op: 아웃도어 용품을

거대한 팬덤을 보유.\n\n\n⑤ 취향의 세계화: 틈새가 주류가 되다\n제가 뽑은 취향 경제의 마지막 브랜드 키워드는 ‘글로벌’입니다. 취향은 ‘틈새 니즈’를 의미하기도 합니다. 소수의 독특한 취향은 대중 상품으로는 만족시킬 수 없는 틈새시장을 만드는 핵심 동력이 되죠. 이런 취향이 처음 탄생할 때 시장성은 고려되지 않습니다. 취향은 취미 성격이 짙은 소수 문화로 시작합니다. 하지만 문화 자본이 경제 자본이 되기 위해서는 시장성이 필요합니다. 그 시장성을 만들어주는 것이 바로 ‘글로벌’입니다.\n특정 취향을 즐기는 국내 인구가 1%라면 타깃 소비자는 50만 명에 불과합니다. 하지만 전 세계로 확장되었을 때의 1%는 8천만 명에 달하죠. 아무리 작은 취향이라도 글로벌로 나아가면 큰 시장이 만들어질 수 있습니다. 그래서 취향 산업은 글로벌 진출이 필수입니다. 우리가 즐기는 음악·영화·뷰티·향수·패션 등 취향이 돋보이는 카테고리에서 글로벌 브랜드가 유독 많은 이유이기도 하죠.\n콘텐츠의 글로벌화도 가속화될 것입니다. 이전에는 잠재 관객 수가 적을 것으로 보이는 장르나 소재는 콘텐츠로 제작이 어려웠습니다. 시장성이 낮다고 판단된 것이죠. 하지만 넷플릭스와 유튜브가 등장하면서 달라졌습니다. 한 국가에서만의 공개가 아닌, 전 세계 공개가 가능해지면서 시장성을 확보하게 되었고, 그 결과 콘텐츠는 다양해졌습니다. 그리고 이는 취향의 시대를 더 가속화했죠.\n취향 시대의 브랜드는 ‘글로벌’을 선택이 아닌 필수로 생각해야 합니다. 더욱이 틈새 시장(Niche Market)을 겨냥하는 브랜드라면 말이죠. 그리고 디지털 플랫폼이 강력한 로켓이 되어줄 것입니다. 크리스 앤더슨은 『롱테일 경제학』에서 우리는 롱테일의 시대로 이동하고 있으며, 수많은 비인기 상품의 수요가 주류 상품의 수요를 능가할 수 있다고 말했습니다. 그리고 이 롱테일은 지리적 한계가 없는 글로벌 디지털 플랫폼에서만 실현될 수 있다고 했죠.\n앞으로도 디지털을 통해 ‘글로벌 취향인’을 만나는 브랜드는 수요와 시장성을 확보할 수 있을 것입니다. 이는 곧, 지속 가능성을 확보한다는 뜻이고 브랜드가 생명력을 가진다는 의미이기도 합니다. 디지털 플랫폼을 통한 글로벌 진출은 취향 경제 시대 속 또 다른 생존 공식입니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n샥즈(Shokz) : 2004년 중국에서 설립된 브랜드로 골전도 기술에 집중해 ‘골전도 헤드폰’을 출시. 쇼피파이 플랫폼을

피크(Snow Peak): 고가 하이엔드 캠핑 장비라는 니치 마켓을 개척하고, 장인 정신이 담긴 제품과 캠핑 문화를 결합하여 글로벌 라이프스타일 브랜드로 확장.\n\n\n소비자·기술·문화: 앞으로 취향 경제를 이끌 키워드\n‘취향 중심’으로 삶의 양상이 바뀐 소비자는 막강한 소비 권력으로 브랜드와 시장을 변화시켰습니다. 브랜드의 역할, 상품 구조, 마케팅, 유통 패러다임 등을 크게 뒤바꿨죠. 이제 ‘취향 경제’를 이해하지 않는 브랜드는 살아남기 어려워졌습니다.\n위의 5가지 키워드는 사실 새로운 것이 아닙니다. 비즈니스의 본질은 결국 ‘소비자’입니다. 소비자의 변화를 읽는 일과 소비자를 이해하는 일에 집중하면 이 키워드들은 자연스럽게 도출됩니다. 나의 가치관을 드러내는 소비, 내 취향에 맞으면 브랜드 규모는 상관없는 소비, 특별한 경험이 매력적인 소비, 나와 같은 취향을 가진 사람과의 소통, 전 세계 시장에 쉽게 닿는 소비는 결국 ‘소비자의 변화’에서 기인합니다. ‘소비자는 무엇을 원할까?’부터 ‘소비자의 소비는 어떻게 변할까?’를 생각해 보는 자세가 브랜드에 꼭 필요한 이유입니다.\n더불어 ‘기술’과의 접목도 함께 고려해야 합니다. 소비자의 라이프 스타일을 바꾼 변화는 기술에서 시작했습니다. 컴퓨터와 인터넷의 등장, 모바일의 등장, 그리고 AI의 등장까지 말이죠. 기술이 소비자의 변화를 이끄는 가장 강력한 동력인만큼, 기술에 대한 이해와 더불어 기술을 브랜드에 어떻게 접목해야 할지 생각해야 합니다. 예를 들면 한 피자 스타트업이 AI 기술을 통해 ‘나만을 위한 피자’를 만들 수 있는 공정 설계를 시작한 것처럼 말이죠. 취향 산업 전반에 기술이 가미될 것이고, 취향 경제는 더 급성장하게 될 것입니다.\n마지막으로 ‘문화적 브랜드’로의 자세도 강조하고 싶습니다. 브랜드 자체를 취향으로 삼기 위해서는 ‘문화적 관점’이 필요합니다. 모든 취향은 문화에서 시작됐습니다. 문화를 즐기는 소수에서 취향이 만들어지고 확대됐습니다. 소비자는 앞으로 더 까다로워질 것이고 취향의 심도는 깊어질 것입니다. 취향은 더 세분화되고 더 빨라지는 ‘비선형적 취향’일 가능성이 높습니다. 소비자의 취향에 맞춰 따라가기란 쉽지 않을 것입니다. \n그렇다면 오히려 브랜드가 취향이 되어, 브랜드를 추종하는 취향인을 양산하는 전략이 효과적일 수 있습니다. 할리데이비슨, 룰루레몬, 애플 등은 '문화'를 만들어 브랜드 자체가 취향이 된 대표적인 사례입니다. 이들처럼 문화를 만드는 것에 집중하는 것도 취향 경제 시대의 생존 전략일 수 있습니다. 소비자를 이해하고, 기술을 접목하며, 브랜드 자체가 문화가 되는 것. 이는 앞으로 더 확장될 취향 경제 시대에 브랜드를 움직이고 새로운 경제 질서를 만드는 가장 강력한 ‘정석’이 될 것입니다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0

확장되었거든요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}뉴욕 시티 마라톤과\n첫 번째 러닝 붐\n지금은 세계 7대 마라톤* 중 하나로 꼽히는 뉴욕 시티 마라톤은 처음엔 그저 지역 행사에 불과했습니다. 1970년 열린 첫 대회 참가자는 127명, 예산은 고작 100만 원 남짓이었죠.\n뉴욕 시티 마라톤의 목표는 1897년 창설된 보스턴 마라톤을 따라잡는 것이었고, ‘모두를 위한 마라톤’이라는 색다른 비전을 내세웠죠. 이를 위해 당시 보스턴 마라톤에는 출전할 수 없었던 여성들의 참여를 이끌어내기 위해 힘썼고, 마침 미국 사회에 불던 페미니즘 흐름과 맞물리며 양성평등의 가치를 실현한 대회로 정체성을 만들어 갔습니다.\n* 보스턴, 시카고, 뉴욕, 베를린, 런던, 도쿄, 시드니에서 열리는 세계 주요 마라톤 대회\n\n웰니스 라이프의 아이콘이 된 뉴욕 시티 마라톤 완주 메달 / 사진: Sipa USA\n1970년대, 미국 전역에는 러닝 붐이 일었습니다. 베트남전의 후유증과 히피문화, 시민운동의 물결을 지나며 사람들이 복잡한 세상 속에서 자기 삶의 균형을 찾기 시작했기 때문이죠. 달리기는 단순한 운동을 넘어 스스로를 건강하게 관리하는 수단이 되었고, 한 해 평균 200개에 달하는 마라톤 대회가 열릴 만큼 인기는 폭발적이었습니다. 도심 공원에서 러닝화를 신고 달리는 중산층에게 러닝은 자기 관리의 상징이 되었습니다.\n뉴욕 시티 마라톤을 주최하는 뉴욕 로드 러너스 클럽(New York Road Runners Club, NYRRC)은 이 흐름을 정확히 읽었습니다. 그들은 엘리트 중심의 대회 대신, 모든 성별과 연령에 열려 있을 뿐만 아니라 완주만으로도 의미가 있는 대회를 만들었습니다. 시간에 상관없이 끝까지 달릴 수만 있다면 누구나 피니시 라인에서 메달을 받을 수 있었고, 이 메달은 웰니스 라이프를 상징하는 의식으로 자리 잡았습니다.\n시간이 흐르며 뉴욕 마라톤은 러닝 문화와 젠더 평등, 그리고 도시 브랜딩이 맞물린 하나의 아이콘이 되었죠. 2025년 대회 참가 신청자는 20만 명. 완주자는 5만 명이 넘고, 경제효과는 약 1조 원에 이릅니다. 기록의 무대였던 마라톤이 사람들의 무대로 옮겨가면서 거대한 산업으로 발전하게 된 것입니다.\n러닝 슈즈의 대명사로\n떠오른 나이키\n이런 흐름 속에서 함께 성장한 브랜드가 있습니다. 바로 나이키입니다. 1970년대 초, 나이키는 가볍고 쿠션감이 뛰어난 러닝화 ‘코르테즈’를 선보였습니다. 이 모델은 높은 기술적 완성도로 주목받을 수 있었죠.\n러닝 붐 덕분에 매출이 급증한 나이키는 1973년에 미국 장거리 육상 스타 ‘스티브 프리폰테인’ 후원 계약에도 성공합니다. 트랙 위에서 누구보다 거침없던 그는 나이키가 추구한 ‘두려움 없는 도전’을 내세우기에 가장 적절한 인물이었습니다. 이 시기를 기점으로 나이키는 단순한 스포츠 용품 회사를 넘어 도전과 용기라는 철학을 담는 브랜드로 자리 잡습니다.\n\n스티브 프리폰테인이 실제 착용했던 나이키 코르테즈 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\n1971년에는 28억 원에 불과하던 나이키 매출은 1973년 410억 원, 1981년에는 642억 원으로 성장했습니다. 글로벌 기업으로 성장한 나이키 성공 신화의 시작점을 마라톤 붐이 불었던 1970년대로 평가하는 이유도 바로 여기에 있죠.\n포스트 팬데믹 시대,제2의 러닝 붐\n첫 번째 러닝 붐이 일어난 지 50년이 흐른 뒤, 코로나19가 다시 세상을 바꿨습니다. 실내 스포츠가 멈춘 팬데믹 시기, 사람들은 집 밖으로 나와 달리기 시작합니다. 헬스장 대신 공원이, 실내 트랙 대신 도심이 운동장이 되어, 러닝화를 신은 사람들로 거리가 채워졌습니다.\n영국 경제지 <이코노미스트>에 따르면, 2023년 전 세계 스포츠 슈즈 매출은 2018년에 비해 50%나 늘었습니다. 그 배경에는 팬데믹이 만든 새로운 습관이 있었죠. 야외를 달리는 경험이 ‘심리적 해방’과 ‘자기 회복’을 상징하게 된 겁니다.\n2024년 런던과 뉴욕 시티 마라톤 참가자는 각각 55,000명을 넘어 역대 최고치를 기록했습니다. 세계 곳곳에서 러닝 크루와 러너스 클럽이 생겨났고, SNS에는 해시태그 #RunningCrew, #RunForLife가 넘쳐났습니다.\n한국도 예외가 아니었습니다. 소셜 미디어를 통해 건강한 라이프스타일을 공유하는 문화가 퍼지면서, 젊은 세대에게 러닝은 ‘트렌디한 자기관리’가 되었습니다. 달리는 일은 곧 새로운 일상의 리추얼이 되었죠.\n러닝 아이콘으로 떠오른\n온 러닝과 호카\n제2의 러닝 붐은 스포츠 브랜드의 판도까지 바꿔놓았습니다. 그 중심에는 호카(HOKA)와 온 러닝(On Running)이 있습니다.\n얼핏 보면 다소 투박해 보이지만, 호카 러닝화는 압도적인 쿠셔닝으로 러너들의 발을 사로잡았습니다. 2024년 매출은 전년 대비 27.9% 증가한 2조 5,689억 원. 이 성장세에 힘입어 호카는 마라토너들이 가장 선호하는 브랜드 5위로 올라섰습니다.\n온 러닝은 기술과 디자인 두 가지 모두에서 혁신을 보여줍니다. 클라우드텍(CloudTec) 기술은 달릴 때 충격을 최소화하고, 지면을 부드럽게 밀어주는 추진력을 만들어냅니다. 최근에는 스페인의 로에베(Loewe), 한국의 포스트 아카이브 팩션(PAF)과 협업하며 패션 슈즈 시장까지 공략하고 있죠. 기술적 완성도에 더해 디자인 감각까지 인정받은 온 러닝은 2024년 매출 3조 5,672억 원을 기록하며 전년 대비 30% 이상 성장했습니다.\n\n호카와 온 러닝의 상승세는 주가에도 그대로 반영됐습니다. 2024년 한 해 동안 호카는 약 1.9배, 온 러닝은 2배 가까이 주가가 뛰었습니다. 반면 전통의 강자 나이키는 하락세를 면치 못했습니다. 판매 전략의 부진뿐 아니라, 기술과 디자인 모두에서 새로운 변화를 보여주지 못했기 때문입니다.\n1970년대 러닝 붐의 상징이 나이키였다면, 이제 포스트 팬데믹 세대를 대표하는 브랜드는 호카와 온 러닝입니다. 달리기가 다시 한 번 시대의 문화를 바꾸고 있는 셈이죠.\n하코네 에키덴,\n작은 온천 마을을 들썩이는 달리기\n일본의 온천 마을 ‘하코네’는 인구 12,000명 남짓한 작은 마을이지만, 새해 첫 이틀 동안은 전혀 다른 세상이 됩니다. 10명의 대학생이 한 팀을 이뤄 도쿄에서 하코네까지 왕복 200km를 달리는 ‘하코네 에키덴’이 열리면서 관광객과 취재진으로 가득 차기 때문이죠. 하코네 에키덴은 요미우리 신문사와 간토* 학생육상경기연맹이 공동 주최하는 대학생 릴레이 마라톤 대회입니다.\n*도쿄를 중심으로 하는 일본의 수도권 지역\n마라톤 대회가 펼쳐지는 이틀 동안 하코네에는 100만 명 넘는 관광객이 몰리고, TV 시청률은 30%에 육박합니다. 다매체·다채널 시대라는 점을 감안하면, 이 수치는 월드컵이나 올림픽에 견줄 만한 기념비적인 기록이죠. 일본에서는 “하코네 에키덴을 봐야 새해가 시작된다”는 말이 있을 정도로 관심이 뜨겁습니다.\n\n각 학교 이름이 적힌 띠를 두르고 릴레이로 달리는 하코네 에키덴 / 사진: KYODO\n일본 국민의 높은 관심과 대학 간 치열한 경쟁 덕분에, 하코네 에키덴의 광고 효과는 막대합니다. 일본 PR 리서치 기관의 조사에 따르면, 우승 대학의 광고 효과는 약 130억 원, 후원 기업의 광고 효과는 600억 원에 달합니다. 메인 스폰서인 삿포로 맥주는 매년 약 100억 원을 후원하고 있으며, 이 같은 후원금 덕분에 간토 학생육상경기연맹은 개최 비용을 제외하고도 매년 약 30억 원의 수익을 거두고 있습니다.\n하코네 에키덴이 특별한 이유는 경쟁의 바탕에 ‘이야기’가 있다는 점입니다. 교통사고 후유증을 이겨내고 달리는 학생, 부진한 기록에 책임감을 느껴 1년을 휴학하고 훈련에 매진한 학생 등 기록보다 대회에 참가한 선수들의 사연에 더 많은 응원이 쏟아집니다. 대회 기간 동안 마을 상점들은 대학별 깃발을 내걸고, 자원봉사자들은 관광객들과 함께 진심을 다해 호흡합니다. 온천 스튜빵 같은 지역 명물은 금세 동이 나죠.\n하코네는 이 대회의 영향 덕분에 겨울 비수기에도 활기를 잃지 않습니다. 2024년 하코네를 찾은 관광객은 2,000만 명을 넘어섰고, 이틀간의 대회는 1년 동안 마을에 원동력을 불어넣는 ‘축제의 경제’를 만들어냅니다. 하코네 에키덴은 마라톤이 도시를, 그리고 사람의 마음을 움직이는 힘을 가장 잘 보여주는 대회라고 할 수 있습니다.\n우리나라에도 찾아온\n달리기 붐\n이제 한국에서도 달리기가 새로운 도시 문화로 자리 잡고 있습니다. 국내 러닝 인구는 1,000만 명을 넘었고, 1년 동안 열리는 마라톤 대회만 400개가 넘습니다. 춘천마라톤, 경주국제마라톤, 제주국제마라톤은 이미 대표적인 오픈 대회로 자리 잡았고, 반려견과 함께 달리는 ‘댕댕런’, 완주 후 빵을 받을 수 있는 ‘빵빵런’ 같은 이색 대회도 생겨나고 있죠.\n한국의 마라톤 대회도 앞으로 ‘엘리트 러너들의 기록’이 아니라 ‘우리들의 스토리’로 채워져야 합니다. 기록이 아닌 이야기로 완주하는 마라톤이야말로, 도시를 움직이는 진짜 이벤트로 자라날 겁니다. 뉴욕 시티 마라톤과 하코네 에키덴이 그랬듯이 말입니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",

.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}미국인들은 한 해 평균 454달러(약 64만 원)를 팁으로 지출한다. 더구나 팬데믹 이후 팁 비율은 평균 15%에서 22%로 상승했다. 팁에 대한 부담이 날로 커지고 있으니, 미국인의 66%가 팁

change)”라는 인사와 함께 가볍게 잔돈을 남기는 문화도 있다. 나라마다 팁을 주는 방식이 다르다 보니 해외 여행을 갈 때  ‘팁 지불 요령’을 배우기도 한다. 팁은 오랜 세월 이어온 문화 현상이지만 경제적 의미는 여전히 흥미로운 질문으로 남겨져 있다.\n뉴질랜드 ‘경쟁 및 규제연구소(ISCR)’의 연구원 스틴 비데벡(Steen Videbeck)은 팁 문화에 관해 중요한 성찰을 남겼다. 그의 연구에 따르면 첫째, 팁 문화는 우선 고용주와 종업원 간의 문제(principal-agent problem)로 볼 수 있다. 고용주는 팁을 허용함으로써 종업원이 정해진 급여 외에 별도의 보상을 얻도록 한다. 이를 통해 종업원은 고용주가 없을 때도 더 열심히 일을 하고, 결과적으로 고용주 또한 가게 운영에서 이득을 본다. 둘째, 종업원 간의 공정한 경쟁을 유도하는 장치(separating equilibrium)로 작동한다. 일을 잘하고 손님을 만족시키는 종업원은 더 많은 팁을 받으며 자신이 인정받는다는 만족감을 느낀다. 반대로 그렇지 못한 종업원은 자신의 문제를 고치려 할 것이기 때문에, 이러한 구조 속에서 가게는 보다 활력있는 조직으로 유지될 수 있다.\n하지만 일반적인 경제 활동과 비교해 보았을 때 팁 문화는 역설적이다. 할인 경쟁이 치열하고, 소비자들이 ‘더 싸게 사기 위해’ 애쓰는 것이 요즘의 트렌드 아닌가. 하지만 팁은 소비자가 자발적으로 더 많은 돈을 내는 행위이다. 스틴 비데벡은 팁 문화가 ‘모든 인간은 자신의 효용을 극대화하는 합리적 존재’라는 경제학의 기본 전제와 어긋난다고 주장하며 부정적인 결론에 도달한다. \n2,547개의 식사 그룹을 설문 조사한 결과, 팁을 준 사람들이 서비스가 더 좋아졌다고 느낀 비율은 거의 없었다. 팁을 주는 이유 또한 인정이 넘쳐서 혹은 종업원에 대한 동정심 때문인 경우도 많지 않았다. 대부분은 단지 팁이 오래전부터 정례화된 관습이기 때문에, 물건값을 지불하듯 팁을 낼 뿐이었다. 결국 사람들은 팁을 주지 않았을 때 따라붙는 사회적 낙인(stigma)을 피하기 위해 돈을 더 내는, ‘합리적 인간이 되기 위한 비합리적인 선택’을 한다는 것이다.\n바로 이 지점에서 소비자들의 불만이 싹트기 시작한다. 팁을 내든 안 내든 서비스의 수준이 크게 다르지 않다면 왜 비용을 더 내야 한단 말인가. 더구나 요즘은 키오스크가 대세다. 종업원의 손길을 전혀 거치지 않은 화면 앞에서 “팁을 내시겠습니까?”라는 문구를 마주할 때, 소비자는 다시 한번 묻게 된다. ‘이건 누구를 위한 팁인가?’\n미국에서 팁은 왜 암묵적인 룰이 되었나\n팁 문화의 기원은 유럽이다. 다만 언제, 어떻게 이런 관습이 생겼는지에 대해서는 논의가 분분하다. 통상 중세 귀족과 농노 간의 관습으로 추청하는데 부유한 귀족이 가난한 농노에게 한두 푼 수고비를 얹어주는 문화에서 시작되었다고 본다. 그리고 19세기 중반 부유한 미국인들이 유럽을 여행하며 팁 문화를 배웠고 귀족처럼 굴기 위해 팁을 주기 시작했다는 것이 통설이다.\n캘리포니아 대학교 식품 노동 연구센터장 사루 자야라만(Saru Jayaraman)은 팁의 역사를 추적하며,  남북전쟁과 노예제도에 주목했다. 남북전쟁을 통해 노예제도는 종식되었지만 해방된 노예가 할 수 있는 일이 제한적이었고 따라서 그들은 하인, 웨이터, 이발사 같은 서비스 노동에 종사했다. 이 중 식당 종업원이나 철도 짐꾼은 임금을 받는 대신 소액의 팁을 받았는데 이것이 오늘날 미국 팁 문화의 기원이라는 것이다.\n1850~60년대 식당 노동자들은 주로 뉴욕과 같은 도시에 있었는데, 백인 노동자들이 농촌에서 공장 일을 찾아 도시로 이주해 오던 시기였다. 농장에서 일할 때는 집에서 식사를 해결했지만, 도시로 옮겨오면서 외식 수요가 급증했다 (...) 일종의 ‘초기형 패스트푸드 식당’들이 등장했다. 공장 노동자들에게는 약 15분 정도의 식사 시간이 주어졌다. 그들은 '페니 플레이스(penny places)'라는 곳으로 달려가 음식을 집어 들고, 옛 노예들이 음식을 차려줄 때처럼 테이블에 1페니 동전을 올려놓았다.\n- 워싱턴 포스트, 로베르토 A. 페르드먼, ‘I dare you to read this and still feel good about tipping’ 기사 중, 2016.2.18\n위의 기사 역시 같은 맥락이다. 19세기 미국에서 산업혁명이 일어났고 백인 노동자가 도시 공장으로 몰려들면서 식습관에 중대한 변화가 일어난다. 집에서 식사를 했던 백인 노동자는 이제 식당에서 끼니를 때워야 할 처지가 된 것이다. 빠르게 식사를 마치고 곧바로 일터로 돌아가야만 했다. 백인 노동자들의 수요에 부응하기 위해 식당은 값싸고 빠른 음식을 내놓을 수밖에 없었다. 낮은 임금으로 부릴 수 있는 흑인이 주방과 홀을 채웠다. 그리고 이들은 일정한 급여 대신 백인 손님이 건네는 팁으로 하루하루를 살아갔다.\n당시 흑인에 대한 열악한 처우는 사회 문제가 되었으며, 이런 불합리한 팁문화를 퇴출해야 한다는 반(反)팁운동(anti-tipping movement)이 강력하게 일어났다. 워싱턴주와 여러 남부 주를 포함해 전국의 6개 주에서는 반팁 법안이 통과 되기도 했다. 하지만 낮은 임금의 매력으로 인해 이 고용주들의 반발이 심했고 몇년만에 법안은 폐지되고 만다. 오히려 반팁운동이 결과적으로 성공을 거둔 곳은 미국이 아닌 유럽이었다.  유럽의 경우 사회주의를 비롯하여 각종 사회운동이 이어졌던데 반해 기업 문화가 강하고 전세계에서 이민자들이 밀려들어왔기 때문이다. “노동자는 팁에 의존해 살아서는 안 되며, 정당한 임금을 고용주로부터 받아야 한다”는 목소리를 외치며 결국 팁 문화가 옅어진 곳은 유럽이었고, 반대로 미국에서는 팁 문화가 끈질기게 이어져 오고 있다.\n오늘날 미국에서 벌어지는 팁 문화 논쟁의 중심에는 저임금 노동자의 임금 문제가 놓여 있다. 서빙 직원의 상당수가 유색인종인 경우가 많고, 이들은 동일한 노동을 하고도 백인 종업원과 같은 임금을 받지 못한다. 2022년 뉴욕시 의회가 발표한 자료를 보면, 유색인종 종업원의 평균 임금은 백인 대비 84% 수준에 불과했고, 그중 여성의 경우는 60% 수준에 그쳤다. 더구나 업주가 급여를 계산할 때 팁을 포함해서 최저임금을 맞추는 경우도 많다. 즉, 손님이 팁을 주지 않으면 법정 최저임금조차 보장받지 못하는 구조인 것이다. 한국인에게는 팁 문화가 그저 생소하거나 키오스크가 보편화되는 시대에 어울리지 않는  관습 정도로 여겨질 수 있다. 하지만 팁 문화가 일반적인 나라에서는 팁이 단순한 예의가 아니라 노동자의 생계와 직결된 중대한 문제인 것이다.\n우리나라에 팁이 없는 이유\n반면 한국에서는 팁 문화가 자리 잡지 못했는데, 이는 팁에 대한 부정적 인식이 강했기 때문이다. 팁문화는 유흥업소나 골프장 등 일부 서비스 업종에만 있었다. 팁은 소위 ‘가진 사람들’의 과시 행위에 불과했으며 이에 대한 비판 또한 거셌다.\n팁이 너무 많다면서도 ‘아낌없이 뿌리는 사람들’이 많다. 해가 기울고 네온이 켜지는 거리, 주로 도시 사람들의 경우, 나이트클럽, 캬바레 요정, 살롱 홀, 바 그리고 ‘니나노집’에 이르기까지 많은 술집에서 술을 마시고 춤을 추고나서 으레 팁을 준다. 꼭 밤의 이야기만도 아니다. 터키탕, 이발관, 미용실에서 몸을 씻고 그리고 머리를 다듬는다. 호텔이나 여관에서 묵고 나오는 외국손님, 시골손님들이 있다. 어떤 사람들은 골프장에서 한나절을 보낸다. 그러고 나선 거의 누구나 팁을 준다.\n- 동아일보, ‘폐습’ 기사 중, 1972\n위의 기사 내용은 팁을 ‘고마운 노고에 대해 고마운 뜻을 담아주는 것’이라 규정했으며 ‘터무니없이 많은 액수’가 오가서는 안 된다고 못을 박는다. 흥미로운 점은 팁 문화의 기원을 ‘놀이나 놀음이 끝난 뒤 기생이나 광대에게 주는 보수’로 보았다는 점이다. 1980년대 저명한 언론인 이규태는 “부잣집에서는 사랑방에 인정주머니를 걸어두고 심부름 온 종이나 가마꾼, 말꾼, 부고 전하는 인부 등등에 인정”을 주는 것이 팁 문화의 기원이라 설명하기도 했다. 즉, 팁 문화는 조선시대부터 내려온 일부 상류층의 문화 혹은 특별한 날에 여흥을 즐기는 소소한 문화에 불과한데 이를 남용하여 큰돈이 오가고, 손님은 부를 과시하고 종업원이 이를 즐기는 것은 도덕적으로 옳지 못하다는 주장이다.\n1970년대 후반 정부는 팁 문화가 사회 전반으로 확산되는 것을 경계했다. 당시 국세청과 서울시는 ‘건전사회 기풍조성과 소비절약운동’의 일환으로 대한요식업중앙회에 팁은 만 원 이상 받을 수 없다고 통보했다. 단순한 권고사항이 아니었다. ‘월 1회 정기점검과 불시점검을 통해 위반업소를 강력히 단속’하겠다며 업주들에게 으름장을 놓았으니 말이다. 이러한 움직임은 1990년대에도 이어졌다. 학계와 언론에서는 팁 문화를 사치나 과시의 상징으로 비판했고 정부는 유흥업소에서 벌어지는 좋지 못한 관행 중 하나로 분류했다. 한국에 팁 문화가 없는 이유이다.\n작은 관습에도 역사가 있고 경제가 있다. 오늘날 미국의 팁 문화 논쟁을 두고 후대의 역사가는 기술혁신의 가속화나 미국의 경제적 쇠퇴 등을 이유로 꼽을지도 모른다. 그렇다면 한국은 어떨까. 짜장면 위에 올려지던 메추리알과 오이가 사라진 지 오래고, 이제는 반찬값을 따로 받는 식당도 보인다. 최근에는 팁 박스를 비치했다가 악평에 시달린 가게도 등장했다. 해외의 팁 문화를 목격하며 놀라지만 우리 역시 정과 인심이 점점 비용으로 환산되고 있다. 일상의 사소한 변화가 우리 사회의 방향을 묻고 있는 것이다.\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0
