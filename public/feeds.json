        "content:encodedSnippet": "Data lineage is an instrumental part of Meta’s Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) initiative, a suite of technologies that efficiently protect user privacy. It is a critical and powerful tool for scalable discovery of relevant data and data flows, which supports privacy controls across Meta’s systems. This allows us to verify that our users’ everyday interactions are protected across our family of apps, such as their religious views in the Facebook Dating app, the example we’ll walk through in this post.\nIn order to build high-quality data lineage, we developed different techniques to collect data flow signals across different technology stacks: static code analysis for different languages, runtime instrumentation, and input and output data matching, etc. We then built an intuitive UX into our tooling that enables developers to effectively consume all of this lineage data in a systematic way, saving significant engineering time for building privacy controls. \nAs we expanded PAI across Meta, we gained valuable insights about the data lineage space. Our understanding of the privacy space evolved, revealing the need for early focus on data lineage, tooling, a cohesive ecosystem of libraries, and more. These initiatives have assisted in accelerating the development of data lineage and implementing purpose limitation controls more quickly and efficiently.\nAt Meta, we believe that privacy enables product innovation. This belief has led us to developing Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI), which offers efficient and reliable first-class privacy constructs embedded in Meta infrastructure to address different privacy requirements, such as purpose limitation, which restricts the purposes for which data can be processed and used. \nIn this blog, we will delve into an early stage in PAI implementation: data lineage. Data lineage refers to the process of tracing the journey of data as it moves through various systems, illustrating how data transitions from one data asset, such as a database table (the source asset), to another (the sink asset). We’ll also walk through how we track the lineage of users’ “religion” information in our Facebook Dating app.\nMillions of data assets are vital for supporting our product ecosystem, ensuring the functionality our users anticipate, maintaining high product quality, and safeguarding user safety and integrity. Data lineage enables us to efficiently navigate these assets and protect user data. It enhances the traceability of data flows within systems, ultimately empowering developers to swiftly implement privacy controls and create innovative products.\nNote that data lineage is dependent on having already completed important and complex preliminary steps to inventory, schematize, and annotate data assets into a unified asset catalog. This took Meta multiple years to complete across our millions of disparate data assets, and we’ll cover each of these more deeply in future blog posts:\nInventorying involves collecting various code and data assets (e.g., web endpoints, data tables, AI models) used across Meta.\nSchematization expresses data assets in structural detail (e.g., indicating that a data asset has a field called “religion”).\nAnnotation labels data to describe its content (e.g., specifying that the identity column contains religion data).\nUnderstanding data lineage at Meta\nTo establish robust privacy controls, an essential part of our PAI initiative is to understand how data flows across different systems. Data lineage is part of this discovery step in the PAI workflow, as shown in the following diagram:\n\nData lineage is a key precursor to implementing Policy Zones, our information flow control technology, because it answers the question, “Where does my data come from and where does it go?” – helping inform the right places to apply privacy controls. In conjunction with Policy Zones, data lineage provides the following key benefits to thousands of developers at Meta: \nScalable data flow discovery: Data lineage answers the question above by providing an end-to-end, scalable graph of relevant data flows. We can leverage the lineage graphs to visualize and explain the flow of relevant data from the point where it is collected to all the places where it is processed.\nEfficient rollout of privacy controls: By leveraging data lineage to track data flows, we can easily pinpoint the optimal integration points for privacy controls like Policy Zones within the codebase, streamlining the rollout process. Thus we have developed a powerful flow discovery tool as part of our PAI tool suite, Policy Zone Manager (PZM), based on data lineage. PZM enables developers to rapidly identify multiple downstream assets from a set of sources simultaneously, thereby accelerating the rollout process of privacy controls.\nContinuous compliance verification: Once the privacy requirement has been fully implemented, data lineage plays a vital role in monitoring and validating data flows continuously, in addition to the enforcement mechanisms such as Policy Zones.\nTraditionally, data lineage has been collected via code inspection using manually authored data flow diagrams and spreadsheets. However, this approach does not scale in large and dynamic environments, such as Meta, with billions of lines of continuously evolving code. To tackle this challenge, we’ve developed a robust and scalable lineage solution that uses static code analysis signals as well as runtime signals.\nWalkthrough: Implementing data lineage for religion data\nWe’ll share how we have automated lineage tracking to identify religion data flows through our core systems, eventually creating an end-to-end, precise view of downstream religion assets being protected, via the following two key stages:\nCollecting data flow signals: a process to capture data flow signals from many processing activities across different systems, not only for religion, but for all other types of data, to create an end-to-end lineage graph. \nIdentifying relevant data flows: a process to identify the specific subset of data flows (“subgraph”) within the lineage graph that pertains to religion. \nThese stages propagate through various systems including function-based systems that load, process, and propagate data through stacks of function calls in different programming languages (e.g., Hack, C++, Python, etc.) such as web systems and backend services, and batch-processing systems that process data rows in batch (mainly via SQL) such as data warehouse and AI systems. \nFor simplicity, we will demonstrate these for the web, the data warehouse, and AI, per the diagram below.\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the web system\nWhen setting up a profile on the Facebook Dating app, people can populate their religious views. This information is then utilized to identify relevant matches with other people who have specified matched values in their dating preferences. On Dating, religious views are subject to purpose limitation requirements, for example, they will not be used to personalize experiences on other Facebook Products. \n\nWe start with someone entering their religion information on their dating media profile using their mobile device, which is then transmitted to a web endpoint. The web endpoint subsequently logs the data into a logging table and stores it in a database, as depicted in the following code snippet:\n\nNow let’s see how we collect lineage signals. To do this, we need to employ both static and runtime analysis tools to effectively discover data flows, particularly focusing on where religion is logged and stored. By combining static and runtime analysis, we enhance our ability to accurately track and manage data flows.\nStatic analysis tools simulate code execution to map out data flows within our systems. They also emit quality signals to indicate the confidence of whether a data flow signal is a true positive. However, these tools are limited by their lack of access to runtime data, which can lead to false positives from unexecuted code.\nTo address this limitation, we utilize Privacy Probes, a key component of our PAI lineage technologies. Privacy Probes automate data flow discovery by collecting runtime signals. These signals are gathered in real time during the execution of requests, allowing us to trace the flow of data into loggers, databases, and other services. \nWe have instrumented Meta’s core data frameworks and libraries at both the data origin points (sources) and their eventual outputs (sinks), such as logging framework, which allows for comprehensive data flow tracking. This approach is exemplified in the following code snippet:\n\nDuring runtime execution, Privacy Probes does the following:\nCapturing payloads: It captures source and sink payloads in memory on a sampled basis, along with supplementary metadata such as event timestamps, asset identifiers, and stack traces as evidence for the data flow. \nComparing payloads: It then compares the source and sink payloads within a request to identify data matches, which helps in understanding how data flows through the system. \nCategorizing results: It categorizes results into two sets. The match-set includes pairs of source and sink assets where data matches exactly or one is contained by another, therefore providing high confidence evidence of data flow between the assets. The full-set includes all source and sink pairs within a request no matter whether the sink is tainted by the source. Full-set is a superset of match-set with some noise but still important to send to human reviewers since it may contain transformed data flows. \nThe above procedure is depicted in the diagram below:\n\nLet’s look at the following examples where various religions are received in an endpoint and various values (copied or transformed) being logged in three different loggers:\nInput Value (source)\nOutput Value (sink)\nData Operation\nMatch Result\nFlow Confidence\n\n\n“Atheist”\n“Atheist”\nData Copy\nEXACT_MATCH\nHIGH\n\n\n“Buddhist”\n{metadata: {religion: Buddhist}}\nSubstring\nCONTAINS\nHIGH\n\n\n{religions:\n[“Catholic”, “Christian”]}\n{count : 2}\nTransformed\nNO_MATCH\nLOW\n\n\n\n\n\nThese signals together are used to construct a lineage graph to understand the flow of data through our web system as shown in the following diagram:\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the data warehouse system\nWith the user’s religion logged in our web system, it can propagate to the data warehouse for offline processing. To gather data flow signals, we employ a combination of both runtime instrumentation and static code analysis in a different way from the web system. The involved SQL queries are logged for data processing activities by the Presto and Spark compute engines (among others). Static analysis is then performed for the logged SQL queries and job configs in order to extract data flow signals.\nLet’s examine a simple SQL query example that processes data for the data warehouse as the following:\n\nWe’ve developed a SQL analyzer to extract data flow signals between the input table, “safety_log_tbl” and the output table, “safety_training_tbl” as shown in the following diagram. In practice, we also collect more granular-level lineage such as at column-level (e.g., “user_id” -> “target_user_id”, “religion” -> “target_religion”).\nThere are instances where data is not fully processed by SQL queries, resulting in logs that contain data flow signals for either reads or writes, but not both. To ensure we have complete lineage data, we leverage contextual information (such as execution environments; job or trace IDs) collected at runtime to connect these reads and writes together. \nThe following diagram illustrates how the lineage graph has expanded:\n\nCollecting data flow signals for the AI system\nFor our AI systems, we collect lineage signals by tracking relationships between various assets, such as input datasets, features, models, workflows, and inferences. A common approach is to extract data flows from job configurations used for different AI activities such as model training.\n\nFor instance, in order to improve the relevance of dating matches, we use an AI model to recommend potential matches based on shared religious views from users. Let’s take a look at the following training config example for this model that uses religion data:\n\nBy parsing this config obtained from the model training service, we can track the data flow from the input dataset (with asset ID asset://hive.table/dating_training_tbl) and feature (with asset ID asset://ai.feature/DATING_USER_RELIGION_SCORE) to the model (with asset ID asset://ai.model/dating_ranking_model).\nOur AI systems are also instrumented so that asset relationships and data flow signals are captured at various points at runtime, including data-loading layers (e.g., DPP) and libraries (e.g., PyTorch), workflow engines (e.g., FBLearner Flow), training frameworks, inference systems (as backend services), etc. Lineage collection for backend services utilizes the approach for function-based systems described above. By matching the source and sink assets for different data flow signals, we are able to capture a holistic lineage graph at the desired granularities:\n\nIdentifying relevant data flows from a lineage graph\nNow that we have the lineage graph at our disposal, how can we effectively distill a subset of data flows pertinent to a specific privacy requirement for religion data? To address this question, we have developed an iterative analysis tool that enables developers to pinpoint precise data flows and systematically filter out irrelevant ones. The tool kicks off a repetitive discovery process aided by the lineage graph and privacy controls from Policy Zones, to narrow down the most relevant flows. This refined data allows developers to make a final determination about the flows they would like to use, producing an optimal path for traversing the lineage graph. The following are the major steps involved, captured holistically in the diagram, below:\nDiscover data flows: identify data flows from source assets and stop at downstream assets with low-confidence flows (yellow nodes). \nExclude and include candidates: Developers or automated heuristics exclude candidates (red nodes) that don’t have religion data or include remaining ones (green nodes). By excluding the red nodes early on, it helps to exclude all of their downstream in a cascaded manner, and thus saves developer efforts significantly. As an additional safeguard, developers also implement privacy controls via Policy Zones, so all relevant data flows can be captured.\nRepeat discovery cycle: use the green nodes as new sources and repeat the cycle until no more green nodes are confirmed. \n\nWith the collection and data flow identification steps complete, developers are able to successfully locate granular data flows that contain religion across Meta’s complex systems, allowing them to move forward in the PAI workflow to apply necessary privacy controls to safeguard the data. This once-intimidating task has been completed efficiently. \nOur data lineage technology has provided developers with an unprecedented ability to quickly understand and protect religion and similar sensitive data flows. It enables Meta to scalably and efficiently implement privacy controls via PAI to protect our users’ privacy and deliver products safely.\nLearnings and challenges\nAs we’ve worked to develop and implement lineage as a core PAI technology, we’ve gained valuable insights and overcome significant challenges, yielding some important lessons:\nFocus on lineage early and reap the rewards: As we developed privacy technologies like Policy Zones, it became clear that gaining a deep understanding of data flows across various systems is essential for scaling the implementation of privacy controls. By investing in lineage, we not only accelerated the adoption of Policy Zones but also uncovered new opportunities for applying the technology. Lineage can also be extended to other use cases such as security and integrity.\nBuild lineage consumption tools to gain engineering efficiency: We initially focused on building a lineage solution but didn’t give sufficient attention to consumption tools for developers. As a result, owners had to use raw lineage signals to discover relevant data flows, which was overwhelmingly complex. We addressed this issue by developing the iterative tooling to guide engineers in discovering relevant data flows, significantly reducing engineering efforts by orders of magnitude.\nIntegrate lineage with systems to scale the coverage: Collecting lineage from diverse Meta systems was a significant challenge. Initially, we tried to ask every system to collect lineage signals to ingest into the centralized lineage service, but the progress was slow. We overcame this by developing reliable, computationally efficient, and widely applicable PAI libraries with built-in lineage collection logic in various programming languages (Hack, C++, Python, etc.). This enabled much smoother integration with a broad range of Meta’s systems.\nMeasurement improves our outcomes: By incorporating the measurement of coverage, we’ve been able to evolve our data lineage so that we stay ahead of the ever-changing landscape of data and code at Meta. By enhancing our signals and adapting to new technologies, we can maintain a strong focus on privacy outcomes and drive ongoing improvements in lineage coverage across our tech stacks.\nThe future of data lineage\nData lineage is a vital component of Meta’s PAI initiative, providing a comprehensive view of how data flows across different systems. While we’ve made significant progress in establishing a strong foundation, our journey is ongoing. We’re committed to:\nExpanding coverage: continuously enhance the coverage of our data lineage capabilities to ensure a comprehensive understanding of data flows.\nImproving consumption experience: streamline the consumption experience to make it easier for developers and stakeholders to access and utilize data lineage information.\nExploring new frontiers: investigate new applications and use cases for data lineage, driving innovation and collaboration across the industry.\nBy advancing data lineage, we aim to foster a culture of privacy awareness and drive progress in the broader fields of study. Together, we can create a more transparent and accountable data ecosystem.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees who have played a crucial role in developing data lineage technologies over the years.

To empower and support developers, we build a variety of products for professional development, including powerful AI tools and features that have already enhanced productivity and opened new horizons for creativity. But can we go beyond that and boost productivity even further – improve code quality, unlock future innovations, help execute complex tasks, and change the way you work with code? \nYes, we can! \nWith the launch of Junie, JetBrains AI coding agent, we are redefining how we code by leveraging its agentic power for co-creation right in your IDE. With Junie, you can fully delegate routine tasks to your very own personal coding agent or collaborate with it to execute more complex ones together.

However, IDE support, which is typically tied to Dockerfile, often lagged behind. That created friction, forcing developers to either rename Containerfile to Dockerfile, lose Podman-specific best practices, or just plow through with basic text editing. \nNow, JetBrains IDEs come with built-in Containerfile recognition. This might seem like a relatively minor enhancement, but it really contributes to a smooth developer experience for anyone juggling Docker, Podman, and Buildah in the same environment.\nIt is no longer necessary to keep separate versions of your build files just so your IDE doesn’t treat them as plain text. And for new hires or open-source contributors using Podman straight from the get-go, it provides enhanced clarity.\nSyntax highlighting, linting, and snippet suggestions are fully supported, reducing errors, speeding up debugging, and improving clarity – especially for new hires or contributors using Podman. Now, it doesn’t matter if you switch engines or if half the team uses Docker while the other half uses Podman – everyone can work with the same file, recognized by the same tools.\n\n\n\n\nSupport for lowercase instructions in Dockerfiles \nIntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 EAP 2 brings enhanced Dockerfile support, allowing you to write directives in lowercase in addition to the conventional uppercase. Previously, the IDE recognized commands like FROM, RUN, and COPY primarily as Dockerfile instructions. Now, you’re also free to use the lowercase from, run, and copy, too.\nAlthough Docker itself is case-insensitive with regard to instructions, uppercase has historically been used to improve readability and to distinguish instructions from arguments. However, alternative casing styles might be preferred to accommodate specific commands, plugins, corporate standards, or personal preferences. With this update, you can adhere to your preferred conventions without risking missing highlights or encountering misleading warnings from the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nNew inspection for reliable ENTRYPOINT initialization with exec\nWe’ve introduced a new Dockerfile inspection that ensures your ENTRYPOINT is correctly initiated with exec. Using exec allows signals sent via docker stop to reach the main process directly, preventing lingering or improperly terminated processes. If you omit exec, your application may run as a child process and fail to receive signals like SIGTERM, making shutdown unreliable. This inspection highlights incorrect ENTRYPOINT usage and guides you toward best practices, helping you maintain cleaner Dockerfiles and more robust container lifecycles.\n\n\n\n\nThese are the key updates for this week. For the complete list of changes, refer to the release notes.\nWe’d love for you to explore the new features and share your feedback. Let us know your thoughts and ideas in the comments below, or get in touch with us on X. If you encounter any issues, please report them through our issue tracker.\nHappy developing!",

        "title": "Anomaly Detection in Time Series",
        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2025/01/anomaly-detection-in-time-series/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 12:14:32 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "How do you identify unusual patterns in data that might reveal critical issues or hidden opportunities? Anomaly detection helps identify data that deviates significantly from the norm. Time series data, which consists of data collected over time, often includes trends and seasonal patterns. Anomalies in time series data occur when these patterns are disrupted, making anomaly detection a valuable tool in industries like sales, finance, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nAs time series data has unique characteristics like seasonality and trends, specialized methods are required to detect anomalies effectively. In this blog post, we’ll explore some popular methods for anomaly detection in time series, including STL decomposition and LSTM prediction, with detailed code examples to help you get started.\nTime series anomaly detection in businesses\nTime series data is essential to many businesses and services. Many businesses record data over time with timestamps, allowing changes to be analyzed and data to be compared over time. Time series are useful when comparing a certain quantity over a certain period, as, for example, in a year-over-year comparison where the data exhibits characteristics of seasonalities.\nSales monitoring\nOne of the most common examples of time series data with seasonalities is sales data. As a lot of sales are affected by annual holidays and the time of the year, it is hard to draw conclusions about sales data without considering the seasonalities. Because of that, a common method for analyzing and finding anomalies in sales data is STL decomposition, which we will cover in detail later in this blog post.\nFinance\nFinancial data, such as transactions and stock prices, are typical examples of time series data. In the finance industry, analyzing and detecting anomalies in this data is a common practice. For example, time series prediction models can be used in automatic trading. We’ll use a time series prediction to identify anomalies in stock data later in this blog post.\nManufacturing\nAnother use case of time series anomaly detection is monitoring defects in production lines. Machines are often monitors, making time series data available. Being able to notify management of potential failures is essential, and anomaly detection plays a key role.\nMedicine and healthcare\nIn medicine and healthcare, human vitals are monitored and anomalies can be detected. This is important enough in medical research, but it’s critical in diagnostics. If a patient at a hospital has anomalies in their vitals and is not treated immediately, the results can be fatal.\nWhy is it important to use special methods for time series anomaly detection?\nTime series data is special in the sense that it sometimes cannot be treated like other types of data. For example, when we apply a train test split to time series data, the sequentially related nature of the data means we cannot shuffle it. This is also true when applying time series data to a deep learning model. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is commonly used to take the sequential relationship into account, and training data is input as time windows, which preserve the sequence of events within.\nTime series data is also special because it often has seasonality and trends that we cannot ignore. This seasonality can manifest in a 24-hour cycle, a 7-day cycle, or a 12-month cycle, just to name a few common possibilities. Anomalies can only be determined after the seasonality and trends have been considered, as you will see in our example below. \nMethods used for anomaly detection in time series\nBecause time series data is special, there are specific methods for detecting anomalies in it. Depending on the type of data, some of the methods and algorithms we mentioned in the previous blog post about anomaly detection can be used on time series data. However, with those methods, the anomaly detection may not be as robust as using ones specifically designed for time series data. In some cases, a combination of detection methods can be used to reconfirm the detection result and avoid false positives or negatives.\nSTL decomposition\nOne of the most popular ways to use time series data that has seasonality is STL decomposition – seasonal trend decomposition using LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing). In this method, a time series is decomposed using an estimate of seasonality (with the period provided or determined using an algorithm), a trend (estimated), and the residual (the noise in the data). A Python library that provides STL decomposition tools is the statsmodels library.\n\n\n\n\nAn anomaly is detected when the residual is beyond a certain threshold. \nUsing STL decomposition on beehive data\nIn an earlier blog post, we explored anomaly detection in beehives using the OneClassSVM and IsolationForest methods. \nIn this tutorial, we’ll analyze beehive data as a time series using the STL class provided by the statsmodels library. To get started, set up your environment using this file: requirements.txt. \n1. Install the library\nSince we have only been using the model provided by Scikit-learn, we will need to install statsmodels from PyPI. This is easy to do in PyCharm. \nStart with PyCharm Pro for free\n                                                    \nGo to the Python Package window (choose the icon at the bottom of the left-hand side of the IDE) and type in statsmodels in the search box.\n\n\n\n\nYou can see all of the information about the package on the right-hand side. To install it, simply click Install package.\n2. Create a Jupyter notebook\nTo investigate the dataset further, let’s create a Jupyter notebook to take advantage of the tools that PyCharm’s Jupyter notebook environment provides.\n\n\n\n\nWe will import pandas and load the .csv file.\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('../data/Hive17.csv', sep=\";\")\ndf = df.dropna()\ndf\n\n\n\n\n3. Inspect the data as graphs\nNow, we can inspect the data as graphs. Here, we would like to see the temperature of hive 17 over time. Click on Chart view in the dataframe inspector and then choose T17 as the y-axis in the series settings.\n\n\n\n\nWhen expressed as a time series, the temperature has a lot of ups and downs. This indicates periodic behavior, likely due to the day-night cycle, so it is safe to assume there is a 24-hour period for the temperature. \nNext, there is a trend of temperature dropping over time. If you inspect the DateTime column, you can see that the dates range from August to November. Since the Kaggle page of the dataset indicates that the data was collected in Turkey, the transition from summer to fall explains our observation that the temperature is dropping over time.\n4. Time series decomposition\nTo understand the time series and detect anomalies, we will perform STL decomposition, importing the STL class from statsmodels and fitting it with our temperature data.\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import STL\n\nstl = STL(df[\"T17\"], period=24, robust=True) \nresult = stl.fit()\nWe will have to provide a period for the decomposition to work. As we mentioned before, it is safe to assume a 24-hour cycle.\nAccording to the documentation, STL decomposes a time series into three components: trend, seasonal, and residual. To get a clearer look at the decomposed result, we can use the built-in plot method:\nresult.plot()\n\n\n\n\nYou can see the Trend and Season plots seem to align with our assumptions above. However, we are interested in the residual plot at the bottom, which is the original series without the trend and seasonal changes. Any extremely high or low value in the residual indicates an anomaly.\n5. Anomaly threshold\nNext, we would like to determine what values of the residual we’ll consider abnormal. To do that, we can look at the residual’s histogram.\nresult.resid.plot.hist()\n\n\n\n\nThis can be considered a normal distribution around 0, with a long tail above 5 and below -5, so we’ll set the threshold to 5.\nTo show the anomalies on the original time series, we can color all of them red in the graph like this:\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nthreshold = 5\nanomalies_filter = result.resid.apply(lambda x: True if abs(x) > threshold else False)\nanomalies = df[\"T17\"][anomalies_filter]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))\nplt.scatter(x=anomalies.index, y=anomalies, color=\"red\", label=\"anomalies\")\nplt.plot(df.index, df['T17'], color='blue')\nplt.title('Temperatures in Hive 17')\nplt.xlabel('Hours')\nplt.ylabel('Temperature')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nWithout STL decomposition, it is very hard to identify these anomalies in a time series consisting of periods and trends.\nLSTM prediction\nAnother way to detect anomalies in time series data is to do a time series prediction on the series using deep learning methods to estimate the outcome of data points. If an estimate is very different from the actual data point, then it could be a sign of anomalous data.\nOne of the popular deep learning algorithms to perform the prediction of sequential data is the Long short-term memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The LSTM model has input, forget, and output gates, which are number matrices. This ensures important information is passed on in the next iteration of the data.\n\n\n\n\nSince time series data is sequential data, meaning the order of data points is in sequential order and should not be shuffled, the LSTM model is an effective deep learning model to predict the outcome at a certain time. This prediction can be compared to the actual data and a threshold can be set to determine if the actual data is an anomaly.\nUsing LSTM prediction on stock prices\nNow let’s start a new Jupyter project to detect any anomalies in Apple’s stock price over the past 5 years. The stock price dataset shows the most up-to-date data. If you want to follow along with the blog post, you can download the dataset we are using.\n1. Start a Jupyter project\nWhen starting a new project, you can choose to create a Jupyter one, which is optimized for data science. In the New Project window, you can create a Git repository and determine which conda installation to use for managing your environment.\n\n\n\n\nAfter starting the project, you will see an example notebook. Go ahead and start a new Jupyter notebook for this exercise.\n\n\n\n\nAfter that, let’s set up requirements.txt. We will need pandas, matplotlib, and PyTorch, which is named torch on PyPI. Since PyTorch is not included in the conda environment, PyCharm will tell us that we are missing the package. To install the package, click on the lightbulb and select Install all missing packages.\n\n\n\n\n2. Loading and inspecting the data\nNext, let’s put our dataset apple_stock_5y.csv in the data folder and load it as a pandas DataFrame to inspect it.\nimport pandas as pd\n \ndf = pd.read_csv('data/apple_stock_5y.csv')\ndf\nWith the interactive table, we can easily see if any data is missing.\n\n\n\n\nThere is no missing data, but we have one issue – we would like to use the Close/Last price but it is not a numeric data type. Let’s do a conversion and inspect our data again:\ndf[\"Close/Last\"] = df[\"Close/Last\"].apply(lambda x: float(x[1:]))\ndf\nNow, we can inspect the price with the interactive table. Click on the plot icon on the left and a plot will be created. By default, it uses Date as the x-axis and Volume as the y-axis. Since we would like to inspect the Close/Last price, go to the settings by clicking the gear icon on the right and choose Close/Last as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n3. Preparing the training data for LSTM\nNext, we have to prepare the training data to be used in the LSTM model. We need to prepare a sequence of vectors (feature X), each representing a time window, to predict the next price. The next price will form another sequence (target y). Here we can choose how big this time window is with the lookback variable. The following code creates sequences X and y which will then be converted to PyTorch tensors:\nimport torch\n\nlookback = 5\ntimeseries = df[[\"Close/Last\"]].values.astype('float32')\n\nX, y = [], []\nfor i in range(len(timeseries)-lookback):\n    feature = timeseries[i:i+lookback]\n    target = timeseries[i+1:i+lookback+1]\n    X.append(feature)\n    y.append(target)\n    \nX = torch.tensor(X)\ny = torch.tensor(y)\n\nprint(X.shape, y.shape)\nGenerally speaking, the bigger the window, the bigger our model will be, since the input vector is bigger. However, with a bigger window, the sequence of inputs will be shorter, so determining this lookback window is a balancing act. We will start with 5, but feel free to try different values to see the differences.\n4. Build and train the model\nWe can build the model by creating a class using the nn module in PyTorch before we train it. The nn module provides building blocks, such as different neural network layers. In this exercise, we will build a simple LSTM layer followed by a linear layer:\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass StockModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size=1, hidden_size=50, num_layers=1, batch_first=True)\n        self.linear = nn.Linear(50, 1)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x, _ = self.lstm(x)\n        x = self.linear(x)\n        return x\nNext, we will train our model. Before training it, we will need to create an optimizer, a loss function used to calculate the loss between the predicted and actual y values, and a data loader to feed in our training data:\nimport numpy as np\nimport torch.optim as optim\nimport torch.utils.data as data\n\nmodel = StockModel()\noptimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())\nloss_fn = nn.MSELoss()\nloader = data.DataLoader(data.TensorDataset(X, y), shuffle=True, batch_size=8)\nThe data loader can shuffle the input, as we have already created the time windows. This preserves the sequential relationship in each window.\nTraining is done using a for loop which loops over each epoch. For every 100 epochs, we will print out the loss and observe while the model converges:\nn_epochs = 1000\nfor epoch in range(n_epochs):\n    model.train()\n    for X_batch, y_batch in loader:\n        y_pred = model(X_batch)\n        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)\n        optimizer.zero_grad()\n        loss.backward()\n        optimizer.step()\n    if epoch % 100 != 0:\n        continue\n    model.eval()\n    with torch.no_grad():\n        y_pred = model(X)\n        rmse = np.sqrt(loss_fn(y_pred, y))\n    print(f\"Epoch {epoch}: RMSE {rmse:.4f}\")\nWe start at 1000 epochs, but the model converges quite quickly. Feel free to try other numbers of epochs for training to achieve the best result.\n\n\n\n\nIn PyCharm, a cell that requires some time to execute will provide a notification about how much time remains and a shortcut to the cell. This is very handy when training machine learning models, especially deep learning models, in Jupyter notebooks.\n5. Plot the prediction and find the errors\nNext, we will create the prediction and plot it together with the actual time series. Note that we will have to create a 2D np series to match with the actual time series. The actual time series will be in blue while the predicted time series will be in red.\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    pred_series = np.ones_like(timeseries) * np.nan\n    pred_series[lookback:] = model(X)[:, -1, :]\n\nplt.plot(timeseries, c='b')\nplt.plot(pred_series, c='r')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nIf you observe carefully, you will see that the prediction and the actual values do not align perfectly. However, most of the predictions do a good job.\nTo inspect the errors closely, we can create an error series and use the interactive table to observe them. We are using the absolute error this time.\nerror = abs(timeseries-pred_series)\nerror\nUse the settings to create a histogram with the value of the absolute error as the x-axis and the count of the value as the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n6. Decide on the anomaly threshold and visualize\nMost of the points will have an absolute error of less than 6, so we can set that as the anomaly threshold. Similar to what we did for the beehive anomalies, we can plot the anomalous data points in the graph.\nthreshold = 6\nerror_series = pd.Series(error.flatten())\nprice_series = pd.Series(timeseries.flatten())\n\nanomalies_filter = error_series.apply(lambda x: True if x > threshold else False)\nanomalies = price_series[anomalies_filter]\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))\nplt.scatter(x=anomalies.index, y=anomalies, color=\"red\", label=\"anomalies\")\nplt.plot(df.index, timeseries, color='blue')\nplt.title('Closing price')\nplt.xlabel('Days')\nplt.ylabel('Price')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nTime series data is a common form of data used in many applications including business and scientific research. Due to the sequential nature of time series data, special methods and algorithms are used to help determine anomalies in it. In this blog post, we demonstrated how to identify anomalies using STL decomposition to eliminate seasonalities and trends. We have also demonstrated how to use deep learning and the LSTM model to compare the predicted estimate and the actual data in order to determine anomalies.\nDetect anomalies using PyCharm\nWith the Jupyter project in PyCharm Professional, you can organize your anomaly detection project with a lot of data files and notebooks easily. Graphs output can be generated to inspect anomalies and plots are very accessible in PyCharm. Other features, such as auto-complete suggestions, make navigating all the Scikit-learn models and Matplotlib plot settings a blast.\nPower up your data science projects by using PyCharm, and check out the data science features offered to streamline your data science workflow.\nStart with PyCharm Pro for free",

AI 콘텐츠 홍수 속에서도 끈질기게 살아남을 수 있는 SEO 최적화 전략과 E-E-A-T 강화 방법을 소개합니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 블로그 글을 올려도 예전처럼 구글에서 잘 보이지 않는다고 느끼신 적 있나요? 저도 같은 고민을 했어요. 아무리 공들여서 글을 써도 검색 상위에 노출되기는커녕 방문자 수도 줄어드는 것 같더라고요.\n \n이유는 간단해요. AI 기술 덕분에 콘텐츠가 넘쳐나고, 구글도 검색 품질을 유지하려고 알고리즘을 계속 바꾸고 있거든요. 예전처럼 단순히 키워드만 잘 넣어서 해결할 수 있는 시대는 끝났고, 이제는 **E-E-A-T(경험, 전문성, 권위성, 신뢰성)**이 필수적인 요소가 됐어요.\n \n그럼 어떻게 해야 블로그가 살아남을 수 있을까요? 제가 직접 시행착오를 겪으며 찾은 해결책을 공유해볼게요!\n \n \n  구글 검색 노출이 어려워진 이유\n1.   구글 알고리즘 업데이트의 영향\n구글은 검색 결과의 신뢰도를 높이기 위해 알고리즘을 계속 개선하고 있어요. 특히 요즘은 다음 요소들이 중요해졌어요.\nE-E-A-T 요소 강화:\n구글은 사용자가 믿을 수 있는 정보를 원한다는 걸 잘 알고 있어요. 그래서 건강, 금융 같은 중요한 분야(YMYL)에서는 전문가가 작성한 신뢰성 있는 콘텐츠를 우선적으로 보여주고 있어요.\n사용자 경험(UX)의 중요성:\n페이지 로딩이 느리거나 모바일에서 불편하면 방문자가 바로 나가버리죠. 구글은 이런 사이트를 좋아하지 않아요. 속도와 가독성이 중요한 이유예요.\n콘텐츠 품질 평가:\n단순한 정보 나열로는 부족해요. 구체적인 사례와 심층 분석이 담긴 콘텐츠가 더 높은 평가를 받아요.\n2.   색인(Indexing) 문제\n구글에 내 글이 제대로 색인되지 않으면 아무리 좋은 글도 검색 결과에 나오지 않아요. 다음을 체크해 보세요.\nrobots.txt 설정 확인: 혹시 크롤러가 내 사이트를 막고 있지는 않은지?\n사이트맵 제출: Google Search Console에서 사이트맵을 등록했는지 확인해보세요.\n색인 요청: 특정 페이지가 검색에 안 잡힌다면 직접 요청을 해보는 것도 방법이에요.\n3.   AI 콘텐츠 필터링 기술 강화\n요즘 AI로 생성된 콘텐츠가 넘쳐나면서, 구글도 이를 감지하기 위해 노력하고 있어요. 자동 생성된 콘텐츠라도 품질이 낮다면 순위가 내려갈 수밖에 없죠.\n4.   경쟁 심화\n예전에는 특정 키워드를 잡고 꾸준히 글을 쓰면 상위권이 가능했는데, 이제는 누구나 AI를 활용해서 콘텐츠를 쉽게 만들 수 있는 시대가 됐어요. 그렇다 보니 더 창의적이고 차별화된 콘텐츠가 필요해요.\n \n \n  AI 시대, 효과적인 콘텐츠 제작 전략\n1.   E-E-A-T 요소 강화하기\n블로그에 신뢰도를 높이려면 이렇게 해보세요.\n실제 경험담 공유: 사용해본 제품의 리얼 리뷰를 담으면 신뢰도가 높아져요.\n전문가 의견 추가: 해당 분야의 전문가 인터뷰나 공신력 있는 자료를 인용해 보세요.\n독창적인 시각 제공: 다른 블로그에서 볼 수 없는 나만의 인사이트를 더해보세요.\n2. ✍️ 효과적인 프롬프트 작성\nAI를 사용할 때 프롬프트(명령어)를 잘 주는 게 중요해요. 예를 들면:\n\"2024년 블로그 SEO 트렌드를 심층 분석해줘. 구글 알고리즘 변화와 사용자 경험, E-E-A-T 적용 방안 중심으로 작성해줘.\"\n이렇게 구체적으로 요청할수록 더 좋은 결과가 나오더라고요.\n3.   AI 콘텐츠 검토 및 보완\nAI가 글을 쓴다고 해서 그대로 올리면 안 돼요. 꼭 다음을 확인하세요.\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n \nAI 가 만든 글에 사람의 향기를, 무료 GTPS - 인간냄새\n사람 냄새 나는 AI 글쓰기, 어떻게 가능할까요? 제가 만든 챗봇, GPTS가 바로 그 답입니다! 자연스럽고 공감 가는 글을 만드는 비법을 지금 확인해 보세요. 여러분, AI가 만든 글을 읽을 때 느낌이\nmuzbox.tistory.com\n\n\n문장이 자연스러운지: AI가 어색한 표현을 쓸 때가 많아요.\n사실 확인: 가짜 정보가 있을 수 있으니 꼭 체크하세요.\n개인적인 의견 추가: 나만의 생각을 담아야 차별화가 돼요.\n4.   사용자 경험 최적화\n방문자가 오래 머물게 하려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n모바일에서도 보기 좋게 디자인하기\n로딩 속도 빠르게 하기\n관련 글을 연결해 체류 시간 늘리기\n \n  구글의 AI 콘텐츠 감지 기술\n구글은 AI로 작성된 콘텐츠를 찾아내기 위해 다양한 기술을 사용해요.\n\n\n\n자연어 처리(NLP): AI가 만든 글의 특정 패턴을 감지해요.\n중복 콘텐츠 판별: 비슷한 글이 많으면 순위가 떨어질 수 있어요.\n사용자 행동 분석: 방문자가 머무는 시간, 클릭률 등을 분석해요.\n결국 중요한 건 ‘AI스럽지 않게’ 자연스럽고 가치 있는 정보를 제공하는 거예요.\n \n \n[참고] E-E-A-T 란?\nE-E-A-T는 구글이 웹사이트의 콘텐츠 품질을 평가할 때 사용하는 중요한 기준이에요. 원래는 E-A-T(Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness: 전문성, 권위성, 신뢰성)로 시작됐지만, 2022년 ‘경험(Experience)’이 추가되면서 E-E-A-T로 발전했어요.\nE-E-A-T의 구성 요소\nExperience (경험)\n\n직접적인 경험이 있는 사람이 작성한 콘텐츠를 구글은 더 신뢰해요.\n예를 들어, 여행 리뷰는 직접 여행을 다녀온 사람이 쓴 글이 더 신뢰할 만하죠.\n실제 경험에서 나온 정보는 독자들에게도 더 유용해요.\nExpertise (전문성)\n\n콘텐츠를 작성한 사람이 해당 주제에 대해 얼마나 전문적인 지식을 가지고 있는지를 평가해요.\n예를 들어, 건강 관련 글이라면 의사나 전문가가 작성한 것이 높은 평가를 받겠죠.\nAuthoritativeness (권위성)\n\n콘텐츠가 해당 분야에서 얼마나 권위 있는 정보를 제공하는지, 그리고 그 사이트 자체의 신뢰도를 평가해요.\n웹사이트의 도메인 평판, 외부에서 받는 인용이나 링크 등이 중요해요.\nTrustworthiness (신뢰성)\n\n콘텐츠의 정확성과 신뢰성을 평가하는 요소예요.\n사이트의 보안(SSL 사용 여부), 정확한 출처 제공, 투명한 운영 방침 등이 포함돼요.\n\nE-E-A-T가 중요한 이유\n구글은 특히 YMYL(Your Money or Your Life), 즉 건강, 재정, 법률 등 사람들의 삶에 직접적인 영향을 미치는 분야에서 E-E-A-T 기준을 더 엄격하게 적용해요. 이런 분야에서는 부정확한 정보가 사람들에게 심각한 영향을 미칠 수 있기 때문이죠.\n\n\n\n\n     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n\n\n \n챗GPT 블로그 제목 생성 무료 GPTS, 이슈성 키워드를 롱런시키는 전략\n이슈성 키워드를 오랫동안 유지할 수 있는 블로그 제목을 만드는 방법과 SEO 최적화 전략을 해결한 무료 GPTS를 공개합니다. 연말정산이나 폭설 같은 키워드를 활용해서 꾸준한 트래픽을 유지하\nmuzbox.tistory.com\n\n \nE-E-A-T를 강화하는 방법\n개인적인 경험을 적극 반영하기\n\n내가 직접 사용해 본 제품 후기, 경험을 녹여서 차별화된 콘텐츠를 만들기.\n단순한 정보 제공이 아니라 실제 체험을 담은 글을 작성해 신뢰성을 높이기.\n전문성을 강조하기\n\n해당 분야의 전문가 인터뷰 추가.\n정확한 출처를 밝히고 신뢰할 만한 자료를 활용하기.\n권위 있는 외부 사이트와의 연계\n\n신뢰할 수 있는 웹사이트(공식 기관, 전문가 블로그 등)에서 내 콘텐츠를 인용하게 만들기.\n구글에서 내 블로그가 전문성을 인정받을 수 있도록 관련 기관과 협력하기.\n사이트 신뢰도 높이기\n\nHTTPS 보안 적용.\n저작권 정보, 문의 페이지 등 신뢰도를 높일 수 있는 요소 추가.\n독자 피드백을 반영하고 신속한 대응 제공.\n\n\n \n✍️ 마치며\nAI 시대에도 살아남는 블로그를 만들려면 단순히 AI를 활용하는 것만으로는 부족해요. 사람의 개성과 경험을 담고, 신뢰할 수 있는 정보를 제공해야 해요.\n검색 알고리즘이 바뀌어도 좋은 콘텐츠는 언제나 사랑받는다는 점, 잊지 마세요!  \n❓ Q&A\nQ1. 구글은 AI로 생성된 콘텐츠를 감지할 수 있나요?\nA. 네, 구글은 고급 AI 분석 기술을 사용해 AI 콘텐츠를 감지하려고 해요. 하지만 고품질 콘텐츠라면 상위 노출이 가능해요.\n\nQ2. 블로그 SEO에서 가장 중요한 요소는 무엇인가요?\nA. E-E-A-T 강화와 사용자 경험 최적화가 가장 중요해요. 키워드만으로는 부족하죠.\n\nQ3. AI 콘텐츠를 효과적으로 활용하려면?\nA. AI가 초안을 작성하도록 하고, 직접 수정하고 경험을 추가하는 것이 가장 효과적인 방법이에요.\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n    \"mainEntity\": [\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"구글은 AI로 생성된 콘텐츠를 감지할 수 있나요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"네, 구글은 고급 AI 분석 기술을 사용해 AI 콘텐츠를 감지하려고 해요. 하지만 고품질 콘텐츠라면 상위 노출이 가능해요.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"블로그 SEO에서 가장 중요한 요소는 무엇인가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"E-E-A-T 강화와 사용자 경험 최적화가 가장 중요해요. 키워드만으로는 부족하죠.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"AI 콘텐츠를 효과적으로 활용하려면?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"AI가 초안을 작성하도록 하고, 직접 수정하고 경험을 추가하는 것이 가장 효과적인 방법이에요.\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "한인이 창업했고, 창업 5년 만에 한화로 거의 1조 원에 인수된 화장품 회사 Hero Cosmetics(Hero)의 팟캐스트를 얼마 전에 흥미롭게 들었다. 창업가들의 이야기는 그 결말이 해피엔딩이든 새드엔딩이든 항상 배울 점들이 많아서 재미있고, 한국에 사는 분들에겐 너무나 익숙한 여드름 패치 하나로 시작해서 1조 원짜리 회사를 만들어서 Church and Dwight에 매각한 이야기도 웬만한 케이드라마보다 더 흥미로웠다.\n이 팟캐스트를 며칠에 걸쳐 아침에 운동하면서 계속 들었는데, 그 기간 우리 투자사 대표와 미팅하면서, 이분이 하는 사업은 화장품 분야와는 완전히 다르지만, Hero가 고민하고 거쳐 온 과정에 대해서 같이 이야기하고, 나름대로 고민의 공통점들을 찾고 해답도 같이 찾는 이야기를 꽤 많이 했다.\nHero는 Mighty Patch라는 여드름 패치 제품 하나로 시작했고, 한국에서 만든 이 제품을 온, 오프라인 상점에서 팔기 시작했는데, 얼마 안 지나서 이 카테고리에서는 거의 1등 제품이 됐다. 1등 제품이긴 했지만, 없던 시장을 만들었기 때문에 일단 시장 자체가 작았고, 투자도 받고 사람도 더 고용하기 위해서 회사는 계속 성장을 해야 했다. 여기서 Hero의 창업가들은 더 큰 성장을 하기 위해서 여드름 패치보다 훨씬 큰 시장인 일반 화장품 분야로 확장하는 고민을 했다. 어차피 큰 카테고리로 보면 모두 다 화장품과 뷰티 분야였고, 다른 화장품도 한국의 공장에서 제조하기 때문에 제조사 소싱도 용이했다. 그리고 어느 시점에는 일반 화장품/뷰티 쪽으로 확장하는 게 너무 자연스러운 성장 공식이라서 여드름 패치 판매 시작 1년 후에 이런 고민을 했다.\n하지만, 이들이 내린 결론은, 일단 여드름 패치 분야에만 당분간 집중하는 것이었다. 여드름 패치 분야에서 더 많은, 더 좋은 제품을 더 싸게 판매해서 아예 다른 경쟁사들이 넘보지도 못할 정도로 압도적인 1등이 되고, 미국에서 말하는 소위 category dominator가 된 후에 다른 화장품 분야로 확장하기로 했다. 그리고 그 이후에 같은 여드름 패치를 다양한 색상, 다양한 용도, 그리고 다양한 크기로 만들어서 SKU를 다각화했고, 판매 채널 또한 온, 오프라인 모든 곳으로 확장했다. 이렇게 한 결과, 여드름 패치로만 연 매출 수백억 원대를 달성할 수 있었고, 이 정도의 매출을 하니 이 분야에서는 압도적인 1등이 됐고, 이 category dominator 해자(垓字)를 구축한 후에 다른 화장품 분야로 조금은 더 수월하고 편하게 진출했다.\n위에서 이야기했던 우리 투자사 대표도 이와 비슷한 고민을 하고 있었고, 아마도 꽤 많은 창업가들이 이런 고민을 하는 걸로 알고 있다. 아주 힘들게 한 분야를 열심히 팠고, 꽤 오랜 시간 동안 기반을 닦아 놓으니, 이 분야에서 돈을 내는 고객도 생기고, 아주 빠르진 않지만, 고객에게 서서히 입소문이 나면서 어느 순간 이 분야에서 꽤 알아주는 제품을 만드는 회사가 된 경우를 우린 자주 본다. 그런데 지금 내가 집중하고 있는 시장보다 훨씬 더 큰 수천억 원 ~ 수조 원짜리 시장에서 훨씬 더 빠르게 성장하고 싶어서, 완전히 다른 시장, 또는 같은 시장에서 다른 카테고리를 계속 기웃거리는 창업가들이 꽤 많다.\n이분들에게 내가 주로 하는 조언은 항상 비슷하다. Hero의 전략으로 가라고 한다. 즉, 내가 시작한 분야가 아무리 작아도, 고객이 존재하고, 우리가 의미 있는 제품을 만들어서 알만한 사람들은 이미 아는 브랜드를 만들고 있다면, 일단 이 시장을 완전히 장악해서 category leader를 넘어선 category dominator가 되라고 조언한다. 그 이후에 다른 곳으로 확장하라고 한다.\n예를 들며, 내가 지금까지 아주 오랜 시간 동안 기반을 잘 닦아 놓은 시장의 전체 크기가 100억 원이라면, 일단 이 시장에서 최소 30억 원의 매출을 해서 시장의 30%를 장악하라는 뜻이다. 한 시장의 30%를 장악하면 그 시장의 확실한 category dominator가 될 수 있기 때문이다. 꽤 재미있는 건, 이런 고민을 하는 대표들이 대부분 그 100억 원짜리 시장은 항상 너무 작다고 하면서도, 막상 본인들은 이 작은 시장에서 매출 1억 원도 못 하고 있다는 점이다.\n그래서 나는 항상 이들에게 일단 우리가 만들어 놓은 시장에서 작은 것부터 야금야금 먹자고 한다. 시장에서 압도적인 1등이 된 후에 다른 시장으로 진출하는 게 여러모로 봤을 때 훨씬 더 우리에게 유리하기 때문에, Hero와 같이 현재 시장에서, 현재 제품을 조금 더 다각화할 수 있는 전략을 고민해 보라는 조언을 한다. 전에도 한 번 내가 포스팅 한 적이 있는데, 일단 따기 쉬운 과일을 먼저 따먹는 전략이다.\n이런 조언을 열심히 해도, 두 마리의 토끼를 쫓거나, 아니면 우리 토끼보다 더 큰 다른 토끼를 쫓는 창업가들이 더 많다. 누가 맞고 틀렸다는 문제는 아니라서, 더 큰 카테고리로 지금 당장 진출하고 싶은 분들은 그렇게 하면 된다. 하지만, 이렇게 했을 때 조심해야 할 점은, 두 마리 토끼를 쫓다가 둘 다 놓칠 수도 있고, 더 큰 토끼를 쫓아서 힘들게 잡았는데 막상 보면 엉덩이면 커서 뒤에서만 봤을 때 큰 토끼일 가능성도 있고, 실은 내가 지금 잡고 있는 토끼가 나중에 엄청나게 커질 수 있는데 다른 토끼를 쫓다가 내 토끼를 다른 회사에 빼앗길 수도 있다는 것이다.\n왜 이런 무모한 전략을 계속 고집하는지 물어보면, 대부분의 창업가들은 더 짧은 기간에 더 빠르게 성장하고 싶다고 한다. 이분들에게 내가 한결같이 다시 해주는 조언은 세상의 모든 건 시간이 걸린다는 것이다. 100만 원 매출이 1,000만 원이 되고, 1,000만 원이 1억이 되고, 이런 느린 사이클을 타면서 언젠간 1조 원 매출이 된다. 한 번에 1,000억씩 할 수 있는 방법은 없다. 혹시 있다면 나한테 DM 부탁한다. 그땐 내가 VC를 그만둬야 할 것 같다.",

추가로 소득공제 받을 수 있어요.\n23. 신생아 특례 대출 요건이 완화돼요\n올해 1월 1일 이후 아이를 출산한 가구에 한해 신생아 특례  대출 소득 요건이 기존 부부 합산 1억 3천만 원에서 2억 5천만 원으로 완화돼요. 특례 대출 기간에 아이를 더 낳으면 우대금리가 추가로 0.4% 적용돼요. 이 제도는 2027년까지 3년간 시행돼요.\n24. 비아파트 구입자를 청약시 무주택으로 인정해주는 범위가 확대돼요\n빌라와 같은 비아파트 구입자가 아파트 청약에서 불이익을 받지 않도록 청약시 무주택으로 인정하는 비아파트의 범위가 공시가격 1억 원(수도권 1.6억 원) 이하, 전용면적 60㎡ 이하 주택에서 3억 원 이하(수도권 5억 원), 85㎡ 이하 주택으로 확대됐어요.\n25. 스트레스 DSR 3단계가 시행돼요\n2025년 7월부터 스트레스 *DSR 3단계가 시행돼요. 스트레스 DSR은 대출 심사 시 금리 상승 가능성을 반영해 가산금리를 부과하는 제도로, 가계 빚을 줄이기 위해 도입됐어요. 금융위원회는 시장 충격을 최소화하기 위해 작년 2월부터 이를 단계적으로 시행해왔죠. 스트레스 3단계가 적용되면 같은 소득이라도 이전 단계보다 대출 이자율이 높아지고 대출 한도도 줄어들어요. 올해 대출을 고려하고 있다면 미리 알아보는 게 좋아요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*DSR이란

B씨 역시 토스 안심보상제로 전액을 보상받았다.\n안심보상제는 토스 회원이라면 누구나 신청할 수 있으며, 중고거래는 최초 1회에 한해 최대 50만 원, 금융사고는 최대 5000만 원까지 보상한다. 안심보상제 신청 시, 본인 확인과 담당 부서의 요청에 따라 필요한 서류를 제출하면 대상자 여부 확인 및 접수가 가능하다.\n토스 관계자는 “2024년 한 해 동안 토스 이용자들에게 안전한 금융 생활을 지원할 수 있도록 노력했다”며 “앞으로도 토스는 실질적인 도움을 제공하고, 사용자 보호와 편의를 최우선으로 할 계획”이라고 밝혔다.",

지금까지 꾸준히 준비한 덕분에 안정적인 은퇴를 향해 나아가고 있어요.\n만약 회사에서 DC형을 선택할 수 없다면 IRP 계좌를 개설해 직접 투자해보는 게 좋아요. 공무원이든 프리랜서든 소득이 있다면 누구나 IRP에 가입할 수 있답니다. 소액이라도 매달 꾸준히 납입하면서 IRP를 통해 직접 투자 포트폴리오를 만들어가는 과정은 사회초년생일 때부터 시작하면 좋아요. 30년 이상 일하면서 자산을 관리하고 투자하는 경험은 누구에게나 꼭 필요한 일입니다.\n5. 월급 대비 연금으로 투자하는 비율은 얼마 정도가 좋을까요?\n보통 전문가들은 월급의 10~20%를 노후 자금으로 저축하거나 투자하라고 조언해요. 사실 직장인의 경우 이미 소득의 4.5%는 국민연금으로, 또 일부는 퇴직연금으로 자동납부 되고 있어요. 너무 부담되지 않도록 월급의 10% 내외를 추가로 IRP 계좌 등에 납부해보는 것을 추천드려요. 월급이 200만 원이라면 매달 20만 원을 IRP에 넣는 거죠. 물론 쉬운 일은 아니지만 연말정산에서 세액공제도 받을 수 있기 때문에 놓칠 수 없는 혜택이기도 합니다.\n연금은 중도 해지하지 않는 게 중요하니까 처음에는 감당할 수 있는 금액을 넣다가 은퇴 시점이 가까워지는 연령대가 되면 비중을 점점 높여야 해요. 젊을 때는 복리의 효과를 활용할 시간이 충분하지만, 은퇴 직전에는 이를 기대하기 어렵죠. 은퇴가 가까워질수록 투자할 수 있는 시간이 줄어들기 때문에 더 많은 자금을 투입해야 목표 자산을 달성할 수 있어요.\n6. 개인사업자에게 노후 준비 방법을 추천하신다면요?\n한국의 퇴직연금 제도는 개인사업자에게도 IRP 가입을 허용하고 있어요. 고용주 없이 프리랜서로 일하더라도 연금제도의 혜택을 누릴 수 있습니다. 거기에 더해 소상공인이라면 IRP 외에도 노란우산 공제를 활용할 수 있는데, 이것은 개인사업자가 퇴직금을 마련할 수 있도록 돕는 공제 제도예요.\n노란우산은 연간 최대 600만 원까지 소득공제가 가능하고, 월 5만 원부터 100만 원까지 납부할 수 있어요. 납부 방식은 월납 또는 분기납으로 선택할 수 있습니다. 다만, IRP와 달리 투자형 상품이 아닌 예금 형태로 운용되고, 2024년 기준 약 3.3%의 수익률을 제공해요. 이러한 특성 덕분에 퇴직금 마련뿐만 아니라 목돈을 모으기 위한 용도로도 적합하죠. 노란우산은 투자 개념이 강한 IRP와는 성격이 다르기 때문에, 두 제도를 병행하면 각각의 장점을 활용하면서 세제 혜택과 노후 자금 준비를 동시에 얻을 수 있습니다.\n7. 30년 뒤 노후 생활비는 얼마가 필요할까요?\n노후 생활비를 간단히 계산하려면, 은퇴 후 생활비 감소를 고려해 현재 생활비의 약 70%를 기준으로 잡아보세요. 정확한 계산법은 아니지만 대략적으로 필요한 금액의 감을 잡는 데는 유용합니다.\n2023년 1월 국민연금공단 보고서에 따르면 부부 기준 적정 생활비는 월평균 277만 원이라고 해요. 또, 통계청의 2023년 가계금융복지조사에 따르면 은퇴한 가구주와 배우자(2인 가구)의 월평균 적정생활비는 324만 원, 최소생활비는 231만 원이라고 합니다. 이렇게 277만 원, 324만 원, 현재 내 생활비의 70%라는 세 가지 기준을 참고하면 은퇴 후 나에게 필요한 돈을 가늠해볼 수 있죠.\n이때 잊지 말아야 할 것은 물가상승률인데요, 물가상승률을 매년 3%로 가정한다면 이를 적용해 2050년에 필요한 생활비를 계산해봐야 합니다. 이를 통해 현재의 금액뿐 아니라 미래의 경제 상황까지 고려한 현실적인 노후 자금 목표를 세울 수 있어요..\n8. 국민연금, 퇴직연금, 개인연금이라는 3단계 연금 가입 외에, 노후 대비를 위해 추가로 할 수 있는 게 있을까요?\n3단계를 모두 챙기고 있다면 이미 너무 잘하고 계신 거예요. 보통 개인연금 상품 중 수수료가 너무 비싼 것들도 있어서 배제하시는 경우도 있는데, 오랫동안 보유하면 수수료도 많이 상쇄된다는 점을 기억하시면 좋겠어요. 이렇게 3단계를 잘 쌓고 있는 분이라면, 이제 딱 두 가지가 남았을 거예요. 요즘 자격증을 많이 따시는 것처럼 은퇴 이후에도 추가 소득을 위해 일할 수 있는 전문성을 갖추는 것, 그리고 가장 중요한 건강입니다.\n9. 퇴직연금을 직접 운용하는데도 디폴트옵션을 설정해야 하나요?\n디폴트옵션은 내가 퇴직연금을 직접 운용하고 있더라도 반드시 설정해야 하는 항목입니다. 100% 투자상품으로 적립금을 운용하고 있다 하더라도 디폴트옵션을 설정하지 않으면 안 되니, 잊지 말고 선택하세요.\n현재 퇴직연금 적립금 약 400조 원 중 90% 가까이가 원리금보장형 상품에 투자되고 있습니다. 많은 사람들이 퇴직연금을 적극적으로 투자하는 데 어려움을 느끼기 때문인데요. 자신이 이런 경우에 해당한다면 퇴직연금사업자가 제공하는 디폴트옵션 상품 중 초저위험이 아닌 옵션을 선택해보길 권합니다.\n디폴트옵션은 초저위험, 저위험, 중위험, 고위험으로 분류돼요. 초저위험은 원리금보장형 상품으로만 구성되지만, 고위험 옵션으로 갈수록 TDF와 같은 실적배당형 상품의 비중이 높아져 수익성이 커질 가능성이 있습니다. 직접 투자상품을 선택하기 어렵다면, 잘 설계된 디폴트옵션 상품 중에서 적합한 것을 골라보세요. 디폴트옵션은 내가 가입한 퇴직연금사업자가 제공하는 상품만 선택할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, A증권사의 퇴직연금 계좌에 가입했다면 A증권사가 제공하는 디폴트옵션 상품만 고를 수 있어요. 일부 사업자는 최대 10개의 디폴트옵션을 제공하기도 합니다.\n만약 은퇴까지 아직 시간이 많이 남아 있다면, 고위험군 옵션을 선택해 연금에 적립한 금액만큼은 공격적인 투자를 고려해보세요. 처음에 잘 몰라 초저위험으로 설정했더라도, 지금 내가 은퇴까지 얼마나 남았는지 등을 고려해 다시 선택할 수 있으니 그대로 두지 말고 조정하시길 바랍니다.\n10. 연금을 많이 받으면 다시 세금으로 토해내야 한다는 말이 사실인가요?\n세금은 언제나 복잡하고 어려운 주제예요. 공적연금과 사적연금의 세율 차이, 연금 수령 나이, 연금 수령 총액, 연금 외 소득 유무 등에 따라 세액이 달라집니다. 연금소득도 소득이므로, 소득이 많을수록 소득세도 많이 내야 하는 것은 맞습니다. 국세청을 참고한 뒤 나의 경우를 전문가와 상담하는 것이 가장 정확할 테니, 오늘은 절세를 위해 알아둬야 할 몇 가지를 말씀드릴게요.\n연금 소득의 종류에 따른 과세 방식\n앞서 말씀드린 연금 3단계는 공적연금(국민연금)과 사적연금(퇴직연금, 개인연금)으로 나뉘고, 과세 방식이 달라요. 공적연금은 종합소득세 신고 대상입니다. 연간 1,200만 원까지는 비과세되지만, 초과분은 과세돼요. 사적연금은 분리과세(연금소득세) 또는 종합소득세로 과세됩니다. 일반적으로 연간 1,500만 원까지는 낮은 세율(5.5%)이 적용되고요.\n절세를 위해 알아둬야 할 것들\n1. 1년에 받는 연금소득이 총 얼마냐에 따라 최대 900만 원까지 연금소득공제를 받을 수 있습니다. 이를 활용하면 과세 표준을 낮춰서 세금 부담을 줄일 수 있어요.\n연금소득 350만 원 이하: 전액 공제\n350만 원 초과~700만 원 이하: 350만 원 + 초과분의 40%\n700만 원 초과: 500만 원 + 초과분의 5%\n2. 사적연금 소득이 연 1,500만 원 이하일 때는 세율이 낮으므로 연금 수령액을 조정해 이 구간을 활용하세요. 연 1,500만 원이 넘는 경우 분리과세와 종합소득세 신고 중 세금이 낮은 쪽을 따져 선택해야 합니다. \n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✱2024년 1월 1일부터 연금저축·퇴직연금 등 연금 소득에 대한 종합소득과세 기준이 1,200만 원에서 1,500만 원으로 상향되었어요.\n분리과세: 연간 1,500만 원까지 낮은 세율(5.5%~15%)로 과세됩니다.\n종합소득세 신고: 다른 소득(공적연금, 부동산 임대소득 등)과 합산해 신고합니다. 연금소득 외에 다른 소득이 많다면 분리과세가 유리할 수 있어요.\n3. 사적연금 세율은 70세 이전 5%, 70~79세 4%, 80세 이상 3%이기는 하지만, 여러 연금 상품을 가입한 경우 동시에 받으면 소득이 높아져 세율이 올라갈 수 있으니, 수령 시점을 조율해 세금을 최적화해야 해요.\n4. 부부가 각각 연금 상품을 보유하고 있다면, 연금을 분산 수령해서 종합소득 기준 금액을 낮춰 세율을 줄일 수 있어요.\n5. 연금 관련 세법은 매년 변화할 수 있으니 최신 정보를 확인하고 필요 시 세무 전문가의 상담을 받는 것이 중요합니다.\n\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n이 외에도 아래와 같은 질문을 많은 분들이 남겨주셨어요. <노후 준비 액션플랜>에 이전 화에서 소개했으니 아래 내용을 참고해주세요. \n\n.css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;}“노후 준비 자금은 어떻게 마련하나요?”\n”퇴직연금이 없는데 어디서부터 시작할지 모르겠어요.”\n👉 1화. 은퇴 후의 삶, 준비를 시작했나요?\n👉 3화.
