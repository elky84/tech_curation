Custom models are fine-tuned on your organization’s proprietary codebases and coding practices to provide more contextually relevant and consistent inline suggestions.\nHow It Works: Security and Privacy in Custom Models\nThe data used to train your organization’s custom model is never used to train another customer’s model, and your custom model is never shared. You can learn more about the fine-tuning process in GitHub’s announcement post and documentation.\nC and C++ Case Study: Microsoft Office\nCustom models can be particularly valuable for repositories that rely on internal APIs, specialized frameworks, or strict coding styles. As a case study, GitHub partnered with the Microsoft Office organization to fine-tune a custom model on Office’s C and C++ code. After switching to the custom model, Office developers observed code completions that were more consistent with their unique C++ dialect (e.g., macros, strict naming conventions), coding practices (e.g., use of feature gates), and specific needs.\n“Code completion is much better than before. It seems to generate functions quite well, given arguments, return type and a comment explaining what the function does. I personally used it to write a block of authentication code where a pop-up would be shown only if silent login fails.” – Office developer\n\nJoin the Waitlist\nThe code on which you want to train a custom model must be hosted in repositories owned by your organization on GitHub.com. If you meet this requirement and are interested in joining the waitlist, you can sign-up here. Note that custom models for GitHub Copilot Enterprise are currently in limited public beta and subject to change. If you’re interested in learning more, check out the custom model documentation.\nIf you have feedback on Copilot for C++ in Visual Studio or VS Code, we’d love to learn more. You can reach us via email (visualcpp@microsoft.com) or X (@VisualC).\nThe post Tailored Code Completions for C++ Developers: Fine-tuned models are now in limited public beta for GitHub Copilot Enterprise appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization are some of the most time-consuming tasks for data scientists. Nearly 50% of data specialists dedicate 30% or more of their time to data preparation. The pandas and Polars libraries are widely used for these purposes, each offering unique advantages. PyCharm supports both libraries, enabling users to efficiently explore, clean, and visualize data, even with large datasets. \nIn this blog post, you’ll discover how PyCharm’s interactive tables can enhance your productivity when working with either Polars or pandas. You will also learn how to perform many different data exploration tasks without writing any code and how to use JetBrains AI Assistant for data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started \nTo start using pandas for data analysis, import the library and load data from a file using pd.read_csv(“FileName”), or drag and drop a CSV file into a Jupyter notebook. If you’re using Polars, import the library and use pl.read_csv(“FileName/path to the file”) to load data into a DataFrame. Then, print the dataset just by using the name of the variable.\nPyCharm’s interactive tables – key features and uses\nBrowse, sort, and view datasets\nInteractive tables offer a wide range of features that allow you to easily explore your data. For example, you can navigate through your data with infinite horizontal and vertical scrolling, use single and multiple column sorting, and many other features.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature allows you to sort columns alphabetically or maintain the existing column order. You can also find specific columns by typing the column name in the Column List menu. Through the context menu or Column List, you can selectively hide or display columns. For deeper analysis, you can hide all but the essential columns or use the Hide Other Columns option to focus on a single column.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can open your dataframe in a separate window for even more in-depth analysis.\n\n\n\n\nExplore your data \nYou can easily understand data types directly from column headers. For example,  is used for a data type object, while  indicates numeric data.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can access descriptive statistics by hovering over column headers in Compact mode or view them directly in Detailed mode, where distribution histograms are also available.\n\nCreate code-free data visualizations\nInteractive tables also offer several features available in the Chart view section.\nNo-code chart creation, allowing you to visualize data effortlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to compare graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to save your charts with one click.\n\n\n\n\nUse AI Assistant for data analysis and visualization\nYou can access the AI Assistant in the upper-left corner of the tables for the following purposes:\nTo access insights about your data quickly with AI Assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse AI Assistant to visualize your data. \n\n\n\n\nUsing interactive tables for reliable Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nWhy is EDA important? \nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science, as it allows data scientists to understand the underlying structure and patterns within a dataset before applying any modeling techniques. EDA helps you identify anomalies, detect outliers, and uncover relationships among variables – all of which are essential for making informed decisions.\nInteractive tables offer many features that allow you to explore your data faster and get reliable results.\nSpotting statistics, patterns, and outliers \nViewing the dataset information\nLet’s look at a real-life example of how the tables could boost the productivity of your EDA. For this example, we will use the Bengaluru House Dataset. Normally we start with an overview of our data. This includes just viewing it to understand the size of the dataset, data types of the columns, and so on. While you can certainly do this with the help of code, using interactive tables allows you to get this data without code. So, in our example, the size of the dataset is 13,320 rows and 9 columns, as you can see in the table header.\n\n\n\n\nOur dataset also contains different data types, including numeric and string data. This means we can use different techniques for working with data, including correlation analysis and others.\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course you can take a look at the data with the help of infinite scrolling and other features we mentioned above.\nPerforming statistical analysis\nAfter getting acquainted with the data, the next step might be more in-depth analysis of the statistics. PyCharm provides a lot of important information about the columns in the table headers, including missing data, mode, mean, median, and so on.\nFor example, here we see that many columns have missing data. In the “bath” column, we obviously have an outlier, as the max value significantly exceeds the 95th percentile.\n\nAdditionally, data type mismatches, such as “total_sqft” not being a float or integer, indicate inconsistencies that could impact data processing and analysis.\n\nAfter sorting, we notice one possible reason for the problem: the use of text values in data and ranges instead of normal numerical values.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data using AI\nAdditionally, if our dataset doesn’t have hundreds of columns, we can use the help of AI Assistant and ask it to explain the DataFrame. From there, we can prompt it with any important questions, such as “What data problems in the dataset should be addressed and how?”\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing data with built-in charting\nIn some cases, data visualization can help you understand your data. PyCharm interactive tables provide two options for that. The first is Chart View and the second is Generate Visualizations in Chat. \nLet’s say my hypothesis is that the price of a house should be correlated with its total floor area. In other words, the bigger a house is, the more expensive it should be. In this case, I can use a scatter plot in Chart View and discover that my hypothesis is likely correct.\n\nWrapping up\nPyCharm Professional’s interactive tables offer numerous benefits that significantly boost your productivity in data exploration and data cleaning. The tables allow you to work with the most popular data science library, pandas, and the fast-growing framework Polars, without writing any code. This is because the tables provide features like browsing, sorting, and viewing datasets; code-free visualizations; and AI-assisted insights.\nInteractive tables in PyCharm not only save your time but also reduce the complexity of data manipulation tasks, allowing you to focus on deriving meaningful insights instead of writing boilerplate code for basic tasks.\nDownload PyCharm Professional and get an extended 60-day trial by using the promo code “PyCharmNotebooks”.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "One of the key components of TeamCity’s ecosystem is the bundled Amazon Cloud Agents plugin, which allows our customers to leverage cloud agents to scale the performance of their build farms on demand. Given its widespread use and importance, ensuring its optimal performance is essential. \nAs our user base and workload have grown, we’ve noticed some initial performance oversights becoming more pronounced, prompting a closer look at the plugin’s performance.\nPerformance issues with the Amazon Cloud Agents plugin\nThe main culprit for performance issues with the plugin was thread management. Each Cloud Profile would create its own pool to manage instance operations and additional service threads for internal purposes. When the number of Cloud Profiles was low enough, the performance hit was hardly noticeable. \nHowever, the impact of this issue worsened as users kept adding more and more profiles. Given that TeamCity itself is a complex system operating hundreds of threads continuously, adding a considerable amount of additional threads is not something we should take lightly. \nImplementing parameterizable shared thread pools for recurring and one-off tasks solves this problem. This approach will allow for asynchronous operations, like instance provision requests that don’t wait for an instance to start, to be executed promptly without needlessly straining the system.\nBut what happens when the number of threads exceeds the measured optimal amount for a system?\nThe short answer: it causes gradual performance degradation. Eventually, even a highly parallel system will suffer from excessive threads. Common problems include, but are not limited to, context switching and synchronization overhead (e.g. locks). Here, we’ll focus on context switching.\nWhat exactly is context switching?\nContext switching is a very complex topic with many technical details, but for the purposes of this post, we’ll keep it brief. A context switch is a fundamental OS process that saves the state of a running thread and restores the state of another thread. This includes saving and loading CPU registers, stack pointers, and other information crucial to continuing a thread’s execution from an arbitrary point.\nWhat is the impact of this? Each thread is allocated a CPU time slice known as a “quantum”. However, the context switch overhead reduces the effective CPU time available for actual thread execution. This overhead might include processor cache misses and memory contention, depending on the system and workload.\nAs with any performance problem: measure, don’t guess.\nThe solution: applying the patch\nBelow are some performance charts that cover the period between July 1 and August 25. The patch that aims to fight the aforementioned issues was applied around the middle of this period, on August 9.\nThe first graph shows the thread count.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the reduction might look dramatic at first, the starting point is around 575 threads, so the overall reduction in threads is ~25%, or ~250 threads. \nThe next graph shows the queue size of builds waiting to run.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the patch was applied, the chart hit 16,000–20,000 builds on multiple occasions, with frequent spikes above 10,000 queued builds. After August 9, the chart clearly becomes more stable and shows much more moderate spikes.\nGraph showing the number of starting cloud agents.\n\n\n\n\nLowering the average values means we process agents’ provision requests more efficiently and, as a result, cloud agents start noticeably faster. That’s exactly what we observed on August 9: the reduction of both spike frequency and their maximum values.\nWhat does this mean for our users?\nPerformance metrics are a great tool to measure the result of your efforts, but one can argue these efforts are more or less futile if end-users gain no real advantages. With cloud agents, this is definitely not the case – users directly benefit from faster build processing, shorter build queues, and less time required for an agent to wind up. \nAnd as a cherry on top, eliminating so many threads should raise the overall performance and responsiveness of the entire system, ultimately making it more stable and efficient.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we have a JetBrains Community Contributor (JBCC) program aimed at helping community content creators get the most out of their JetBrains tools when creating articles, social media posts, videos, and public presentations. It’s a fantastic program where we try to provide help and feedback and learn from each other.\nOne innovative idea we’ve been exploring and are thrilled to share with you is integrating your presentation slides into your IDE. This approach eliminates the need for constant context-switching between your code and visuals. By the end of this post, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to craft your presentation slides using Markdown, convert them into HTML artifacts, and preview the presentation using your IDE’s in-editor preview, all with a sense of excitement for the possibilities this opens up.\nMARP: Markdown Presentation Ecosystem\nWhile dedicated presentation tools such as PowerPoint and Keynote have advantages, they can be cumbersome and come with unique challenges. In the developer community, we see a prevalence of text-to-presentation tools that aim to transform simple files into visually striking presentations.\nOne such approach is MARP, which allows you to author an entire presentation in a single Markdown file. Let’s look at a presentation we’ll be showing in our IDE.\n---\ntheme: uncover\n---\n\n![bg right:40% 80%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/Rider_icon.svg)\n\n# **Hello JetBrains Rider**\n\n🧛‍♂️ JetBrains Rider Presentation Cool! 😎🌶️\n\nhttps://jetbrains.com/rider\n\n---\n\n# How to write slides\n\nSplit pages by horizontal ruler (`---`). It's very simple! :satisfied:\n\n```csharp\npublic static IEnumerable<int> Fibonacci(int n)\n{\n    int a = 0, b = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        yield return a;\n        int temp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = temp + b;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n🪲 Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!\n\n---\n\n# A New Slide!\n\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n</div>\n\n<!-- Add this anywhere in your Markdown file -->\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';\n  mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nEach slide is separated by the --- delimiter, with the contents of each slide appearing between each section. You can use all the Markdown techniques you’ve learned in writing documentation, including headers, links, code blocks, emphasis, math syntax, and emojis.\nCheck out the Marpit documentation to learn how to author your presentation. Marpit is the framework that transforms Markdown and CSS themes into slide decks composed of HTML/CSS. It is optimized to output only the minimum set of assets required. It has a detailed breakdown of all the options available to presentation authors.\nLet’s move on to the next section, where we’ll set up the MARP CLI in our projects so that our presentation can live side-by-side with our demo project.\nMARP CLI with your Project\nThe MARP CLI allows us to use all of MARP’s capabilities from a command-line interface. You’ll need npm installed on your local development environment to do this. Once installed, add the following package.json to the root of your project or in any folder where you’ll write your presentation.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"marp\": \"marp index.md -w --html --allow-local-files \"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@marp-team/marp-cli\": \"^3.4.0\"\n  }\n}\nYou’ll notice the marp script passes a few flags and arguments. The most important is the -w flag, which lets the CLI monitor and update the file as we create our presentation.\nNext, let’s create an index.md file next to the package.json file. You can use the previous Markdown above or experiment with writing your own.\nNow run npm install to install the @marp-team/marp-cli dependency. You’ll notice in your package.json file that you now have a run button in the editor’s gutter.\n\n\n\n\nRun the new script, and you’ll see a new run window showing the MARP CLI output, which says that you now have an index.html file in the same directory as your Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the Markdown file will now update the HTML file in real-time. The advantage is that you’ll only need to run the marp script when editing your Markdown file. Once your presentation is complete, you can commit the HTML file to source control alongside your demo code.\nPreviewing the Presentation\nNow, for the easy part, show the presentation to your audience. Start by right-clicking the newly created HTML file and choosing Open In | Browser | Built-in Preview.\n\n\n\n\nThe new presentation will appear inside your IDE using MARP’s presentation engine, which lets you move slides back and forth.\n\n\n\n\nMARP also supports syntax highlighting, so we can present code blocks, but you also have the IDE for that.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our marp script, we passed the --html flag, allowing raw HTML to render in our presentations. This will enable us to embed any HTML, including scripts for Mermaid rendering. This is very powerful. For folks looking to be extra, you could also write custom JavaScript components and use them in the presentation.\n\n\n\n\nFor those needing speaker notes, you can press P on your keyboard to open an additional presentation window with all your notes. This extra window can be on a secondary display and control the presentation displayed in the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhile previews default to a side-by-side display in the IDE, you can also drag the tab into a group for a full-sized viewing experience.\n\n\n\n\nIn this mode, you can also use your IDE’s tab-switching shortcuts to switch back and forth between the slides and the IDE.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, with ingenuity and the features already found in the IDE, we can create a new style of presenting important technical content to our community. MARP is an excellent open-source project, and this article scratches the surface of what’s possible. Please try this out next time you’re building a presentation.\nAlso, if you’re a JetBrains user creating technical community content around the JetBrains line of products, please check out the JetBrains Community Contributor program.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Python has almost 30 years of history doing Python web development. Can you believe it? But 3-tier web projects have gotten really complicated and stressful. You’re busy, everything is all over the place – it’s hard! \nBut PyCharm is here to help: bring your work together with the Endpoints tool window. I just made a video explainer:\n\n\n\n\n\n    \nTry the Endpoints tool window! \n                                                    \nHere are 3 things from the video that I really like about endpoints. Plus a bonus point at the end.\nFirst…where is everything?\nPython web projects can get really big, really fast. If you’re like me, it can be overwhelming – and exhausting. I really need a “helper brain” – one that deeply understands each web framework – to stitch everything together.\nPyCharm has long provided icons to navigate from a view to a template, and vice versa. Endpoints adds icons to jump from a view to the route definition, to the parent context, and generate a request to this API.\n\n\n\n\nI like to use my keyboard instead of the mouse. Good news – endpoints is wired into searchable actions.\n\n\n\n\nWant a birds-eye view of all your endpoints? The Endpoints tool window shows all your APIs, with filtering by subapp, type, and framework.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s more than a list. Each entry lets you jump to the endpoint and perform operations.\n\n\n\n\nThese operations have framework-specific smarts, such as knowing the “parent context” for Django vs. Flask vs. FastAPI.\nI like having this tool window when I’m thinking about the whole application. But I like even more how endpoints brings these operations into the editor, to my cursor, helping me focus.\nBring IDE smarts, into APIs\nOur IDE has deep insight to connect the dots in Python development. What if we applied that to Python web frameworks?\nI can’t remember all my API names. Endpoints gives me autocomplete in the HTTP client and even in JavaScript fetch.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to endpoints, these routes become symbols. I’m a symbol-first coder, using autocomplete, warnings, and navigation to the max. Now I can apply that with the web framework syntax for APIs.\nDiscover more powerful web development features \n                                                    \nStay in one tool\nI’ve always liked the “I” in IDE: integrating my important workflows into a single, consistent experience. Web development can mean bouncing around between lots of windows. What if we could bring that workflow into PyCharm?\nWe already brought best-in-class frontend development from WebStorm and database development from DataGrip.\nUsing our HTTP Client, you have a productive, mature workflow for issuing HTTP requests. No need to go to the browser or purchase another tool. With endpoints, HTTP Client gets easier and smarter. For example, issue an HTTP request, directly from the API listing.\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above, writing these HTTP requests is easier thanks to autocomplete, as endpoints knows your web framework and its route definitions.\nYou can also browse the OpenAPI documentation of your endpoint without going to a browser.\n\n\n\n\nThe “I” in IDE means it is one team that is bringing these features across web frameworks. When I learn a way of working once, I can use it when I shift to a project with another supported web framework. Same features, same UI.\nInnovation in Python web development\nPython web development needs fresh new ideas and with it, new thinking in tooling. Endpoints says: “You are going to use multiple frameworks on lots of big projects. Let’s step back, focus on the problem, re-imagine the workflow, and throw a bunch of powerful IDE machinery at it.”\nJust this one tool window has so much value in it: a listing of your API, with info about HTTP method, and right-click available for each. Then, tabs for the common operations, keeping you in the IDE and in the flow.\n\n\n\n\nSo that’s endpoints, a vision from PyCharm to make API development joyful and productive. Give it a try and let us know what you think.\nTry the Endpoints tool window!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 3 has been released, and it’s packed with new features for you to try out! This build brings inline AI prompts with context awareness, extended support for Terraform, including the new OpenTofu project, notable updates for Kubernetes and Docker Compose, and improvements to remote development environments.\nYou can download this version from our website, update directly from within the IDE, use the free Toolbox App, or install it via snap packages for Ubuntu.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 3\nRead on to explore the latest updates and learn how they can streamline your projects and improve your development experience.\nAI Assistant\nInline prompts with context awareness\nIntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 3 includes a range of improvements for the earlier introduced inline AI prompts.\nInline AI prompts are now smarter thanks to context awareness: AI Assistant now automatically includes files and symbols related to the context sent to the language model for code generation.\n\n\n\n\nWe also improved the visibility of changes applied; IntelliJ IDEA now leaves a purple mark in the gutter next to lines changed by AI Assistant, so you can easily see what has been updated.\nIf you don’t like the initial suggestion, you can generate a new one by pressing Tab. You can also adjust the initial prompt by clicking on the purple block in the gutter or simply pressing Ctrl+/ (Windows/Linux) or ⌘/ (macOS).\n\n\n\n\nThe new inline AI prompt works for Java, Kotlin, Groovy, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, JSON, and YAML file formats and is available for all AI Assistant subscribers.\nFrameworks and technologies\nTerraform and OpenTofu: Infrastructure as code\nOpenTofu support\nWe are introducing support for OpenTofu, an open-source, community-driven alternative to HashiCorp’s Terraform, along with support for .tofu files when OpenTofu is selected. This update includes autocompletion for encryption methods, key providers, and inspections for unknown references, making infrastructure-as-code development more efficient and secure.\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the new encryption block feature enhances security in infrastructure management. Sensitive data, such as access keys stored in state and plan files, can now be encrypted using methods like AES-GCM. OpenTofu also supports key management services, including AWS KMS, providing robust protection for your workflows.\nAdditionally, we’ve added support for modules initialized with OpenTofu, expanding the capabilities of this tool within the IDE.\nTerraform usage indicators\nIntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 3 introduces Terraform usage indicators, with quick navigation capabilities, that allow you to see where specific variables, resources, and modules are used. These indicators show the number of usages and their exact locations, enabling you to jump directly to them with a single click. This feature eliminates the need to manually search through files, making it especially useful for navigating large Terraform projects.\n\n\n\n\nTerraform usage indicators can help you find unused variables and make the code cleaner.\n\n\n\n\nSupport for terraform fmt\nYou can now use terraform fmt to format files when invoking the Reformat File action. This allows you to format .tf, .tfvars, and .tftest.hcl files using Terraform’s native formatting tool instead of the plugin’s built-in formatter. This ensures your code is formatted according to Terraform’s standards. To enable this option, go to Settings | Editor | Code Style | Terraform | Other | Terraform fmt in the IDE settings.\nKubernetes\nKubernetes cluster logs\nIntelliJ IDEA now supports accessing cluster-wide logs with streaming and pattern matching which is essential for developers and DevOps/SRE teams. It provides a centralized view of all events across pods, nodes, and services, helping you quickly identify issues without manually checking each log. Real-time streaming enables immediate diagnostics, while pattern matching automates the detection of key events or errors, such as out-of-memory issues or unusual network activity. This approach is crucial for security, performance monitoring, and proactive issue detection in complex microservice architectures.\nTo try this feature, add a Kubernetes cluster in the Services window and deploy an application to it. Then, select the Open Cluster Logs Tab in the cluster’s context menu. A source selection window will appear, allowing you to enable log streaming from various sources. After making your selection, click Add log sources from Cluster.\n\n\n\n\nYou will be taken to the log interface in the editor.\n\n\n\n\nThere, you can view real-time logs from all selected Kubernetes cluster resources. You can also choose a historical period for viewing and filter logs based on patterns that the IDE identifies from them. Additionally, you can use search queries and regular expressions to filter the results. You can change the set of log sources for analysis at any time, and there is an option to download the necessary logs.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork Policy UI\nSupport for Network Policies has been added to the Kubernetes UI. \nNetwork Policies in Kubernetes are used to manage network traffic between pods in a cluster. They allow you to define which pods can send or receive traffic from other pods, services, or external sources. The primary purposes of Network Policies are to control and restrict network traffic, manage pod isolation, ensure security, and regulate external access.\n\n\n\n\nDocker Compose\nNew Docker Compose build attributes\nWe’ve added support for new Docker Compose attributes that give you better control over builds, resource management, service orchestration, and networking within Docker Compose, making development more efficient and flexible.\n\n\n\n\nHere are some of the added options:\ncache_to: Enables you to speed up image builds by specifying external cache locations.\nno_cache: Allows you to disable the cache for specific builds, ensuring fresh builds when needed.\nplatforms: Defines the target platform for services, making multi-architecture support (e.g. ARM vs. x86).\ndepends_on.required: Ensures that dependent services must start before the current service, adding more control over service dependencies.\ndepends_on.restart: Controls how service restarts are handled in dependency chains, providing more flexible orchestration.\ndeploy.placement.preferences: Allows you to specify placement strategies, such as by prioritizing certain nodes for deploying services, enhancing control over where services are hosted.\ndeploy.resources.pids: Adds the ability to limit the number of PIDs (process IDs) for a service, helping you manage resource usage and prevent overloads.\nbuild.additional_contexts: Facilitates building images from multiple contexts, making it easier to work with complex builds that pull resources from various locations.\nbuild.privileged: Grants privileged access to containers during the build process, allowing for advanced scenarios that require elevated permissions.\nbuild.ulimits: Defines ulimit settings during the build, providing finer control over system resource limits.\ncgroups: Enables the configuration of cgroups (control groups), which manage resource allocation for containers, improving performance and resource management.\nextra_hosts: Allows you to add custom host-to-IP mappings in the container’s /etc/hosts file, improving network configuration and DNS resolution.\nhealthcheck.start_interval: Adds control over the initial interval before a health check is run, improving the reliability of service health checks.\nnetworks.mac_address: Assigns a custom MAC address to a container, providing greater control over network configurations.\nRemote development environments \nImproved compatibility for Dev Container templates\nWe’ve made significant improvements to the compatibility of Dev Container templates which were not originally designed to operate in remote environments. Previously, Dev Container templates often included configurations that assumed local execution, leading to issues when running containers on remote Docker instances. With these updates, IntelliJ IDEA now handles such scenarios more gracefully, ensuring that templates not optimized for remote use still function correctly without unnecessary errors or conflicts.\nBetter support for projects in WSL \nWe continue to improve the reliability of projects that are hosted in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and opened by developers from Windows in the IDE. In particular, support for symlinks has been added, and interaction with WSL has been switched to Hyper-V sockets, which has improved the performance of IDE interaction with WSL. We are continuing to work on significant platform changes to improve performance with remote environments, including WSL.\nThese are the key updates for this week. For the complete list of the changes, refer to the release notes.\nWe encourage you to explore the new features and share your feedback with us, as it plays a crucial role in improving IntelliJ IDEA. Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comments below or get in touch with us on X. If you encounter any issues, please report them through our issue tracker.\nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ready to get started on your Django project? Whether you want to build a personal project, improve your portfolio, or just experiment with a new technology, Django provides the perfect foundation.\nWe’ve compiled a list of Django project ideas that will help you expand your competence, whether you’re new to the framework or looking to advance your existing skills.\nIn this guide, we’ll explore a range of Django project ideas to help you get hands-on experience, ranging from simple apps to more advanced, full-stack applications.\nWhen should I use Django?\nKnown as the “web framework for perfectionists with deadlines”, Django is a great choice for building robust, production-ready websites, apps, or services.\nIt’s an open-source and highly versatile Python web framework that can be used for everything from blogs and social media platforms to e-commerce sites, content management systems, and fitness trackers.\nFirst released in 2005, Django continues to receive regular updates and enjoys a considerable following. Its “batteries included” design means you get what you need to build a full-stack web app right out of the box. You can also pair Django with a front-end JavaScript framework for projects that demand richly interactive user interfaces.\nLearn more about Django in our blog, including its key components and benefits.\nStill trying to figure out whether Django is the right framework for you? Read our comparison of Django and Flask – the two most popular Python web frameworks.\nWhere to find Django project ideas\nWorking on a real-world project is one of the best ways to get to grips with Django. You can start with something simple and extend it as you learn more about the framework. In the process, you’ll develop your skills and build a portfolio of work showcasing your abilities.\nStuck for ideas? Previous projects (both professional and personal), forums, dev meetups and hackathons, as well as platforms like GitHub, can all provide sources of inspiration.\nGitHub is also useful for hosting and collaborating on open-source projects – this is where the source code or design documents are made publicly available for anyone to access, modify, and distribute. You can use and build upon various software, making them a great jumping-off point for a Django project.\nSome GitHub open-source Django projects include: \nDjango packages: a directory of reusable apps, sites, tools, and more for your Django projects.\nDjango project: source code for djangoproject.com.\nDjango social: code for a social network or community site built using Django.\nAre you unfamiliar with a particular area, such as routing or database design? You could choose to design a project that addresses this knowledge gap while learning Django simultaneously.\nDjango project ideas for beginners\nIf this is your first time building with Django, look no further. We’ve compiled a list of project ideas that are ideal for anyone using Django for the first time. These will help you find your feet as you explore what Django offers.\nBefore you start, reading this Django tutorial for beginners is useful. It walks through building a simple but non-trivial project by starting with a single file. The tutorial is an excellent starting point for anyone new to Django, as it introduces core concepts and helps you build a functional project from the ground up.\nOnce you’re familiar with Django’s principal elements and are comfortable building within the framework, you can get going with these more dynamic yet straightforward projects.\nAir temperature app\nThis tutorial will walk you through creating a simple Django app using PyCharm that displays the current air temperature at your location. The app also allows users to explore weather conditions at random locations to add interactivity.\nBy following this guide, you’ll learn to:\nSet up a Django project.\nDevelop models, views, and templates.\nMake and process API calls.\nConnect to and populate databases.\nThis hands-on task will give you practical experience with core Django concepts and show how PyCharm can help you develop more efficiently while working with Django. It’s a great place to begin building web applications and sets you up for further starter projects.\nFollow the step-by-step tutorial\n                                                    \nBlog\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango admin: for managing blog posts.\nDjango templates: for rendering HTML pages.\nTinyMCE or CKEditor (optional): for rich text editing.\nBuilding your own blogging platform with Django is a great way to cover the basics of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD), setting up routes, and serving a site locally. To keep things simple, use the Django Admin site to add and update blog posts. To explore further, extend the basic blog functionality by implementing tags and filters, adding a search option, or enabling comments. \nWe highly recommend the Django Girls Tutorial for beginners, which takes you through creating a small blog.\nTo-do list app\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango templates: for rendering the UI.\nSingle-page applications (SPA)/JavaScript: for updating the status of pages and components without reloading the page.\nA simple task list with an option to check items off when complete is an excellent way to learn the basics of developing with Django. You’ll need a UI to add tasks and update their status and a simple database to record each entry. You can also add the ability to record due dates or set priorities.\nRecipe organizer\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango templates: for rendering the frontend.\nDjango ORM: for database interactions.\nJavaScript (optional): for additional security.\nFamiliarize yourself with Django’s ORM (object-relational mapper) and database support by building an app to keep track of your favorite recipes. Add a web-based frontend with options to filter recipes by category, ingredients, and user ratings so you can easily browse for inspiration.\nQuiz app\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango templates: for rendering the UI.\nDjango ORM: for managing the question bank and user scores.\nJavaScript: for interactive quiz elements.\nCreate a quiz app or website to familiarize yourself with each layer of Django’s architecture. Build a question bank, give players a simple UI to select their answer, and calculate the score. Enhance the functionality by sorting questions into categories and adding options to choose topics or change the number of questions asked. You could also add a leaderboard to celebrate your highest scorers.\nAuthentication system\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango built-in authentication: for handling login, registration, and password resetting.\nEmail service: for email validation and password reset (e.g. SMTP server).\nLogin systems are a feature of most websites and apps. Fortunately, adding authentication and authorization to a web app is easier with Django’s built-in authentication system. Creating one as a practice project helps familiarize yourself with the functionality and provides a reusable pattern for future projects. Don’t forget to include key features such as email validation and a password reset option.\nURL shortener\nRequired tech stack:\nDjango templates: for the frontend.\nDjango ORM: for storing URLs.\nBitly API (optional): if using an external shortening service.\nYou can approach this project in a couple of ways, depending on your interests. One option is to build a simple app that sends requests to an existing URL-shortening service, such as Bitly’s API. Alternatively, create your own service by generating shortened URLs, storing the URLs in a database, and defining routing logic to match incoming requests to the appropriate URL.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 continues to be faster with each version. In this blog post we will highlight a couple of the more significant enhancements you’ll experience in 17.11, such as a more efficient C# language service, faster conditional breakpoints and symbol searches in C++.\nReduced CPU usage by C# language service\nCode Indexing\nIn 17.10 we revamped the code indexing system in the C# language service (Roslyn). It used to be both aggressive and highly intermittent.  This would lead to high spikes of CPU usage, taking resources away from the operations users were performing, especially during times like solution load.  After opening a solution, users who wanted to wait for VS to settle would have to wait up to minutes watching a progress bar titled “Running low priority background processes”.\nNow, we no longer preemptively run all the indexers.  Instead, individual ones are run on demand.  In 17.11, these indexers were further streamlined, and made much more incremental, allowing them to consume far less resources when absorbing any change into the index. In addition, there were memory allocation optimizations throughout the editor and managed language services. The net effect of this is a more responsive VS that is ready to go at a much sooner time, with much lower CPU consumption.\nSource Generators\nAs part of our continued work to break VS into isolated, high performance, services, Roslyn’s Source Generator execution host was moved out of the main VS process to a high-performance .NET 8 host.  This helps make VS more resilient to bugs in source generators and allows them to execute much more efficiently.  As part of this work, we also changed the execution model for source generators to no longer run automatically, due to the heavy impact that some generators can still have on the system.  Instead, by default, generators will now run when a document is saved, or a project is built, greatly cutting down on the impact of all generators (especially very expensive ones).  This behavior can be controlled here:\nTools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Advanced > Source Generators\n\nWith the above changes in place, our data shows improved metrics in 17.11. CPU usage is down by 16% percent or more in sessions that had heaviest CPU usage. The C# completion list now appears sooner; looking at the slowest sessions the number of times the list takes longer than 0.5 seconds to appear has been cut by about 40%.\nImproved conditional breakpoint performance\nIn 17.11 we made several changes to improve the performance of conditional breakpoints in C++. The improvements were primarily in two categories:\nAvoiding expensive Windows debugging API calls. Windows calls to get and set information about the debugged process can be expensive, so the data was cached to reduce the number of calls to these APIs. Additionally, some of the information was already available through other sources, allowing some calls to be eliminated entirely.\nReducing data fetched from the debugged process. When a breakpoint is hit, the debugger must fetch a lot of information about the state of the debugged process. This is needed to populate things such as the locals tool window, the Diagnostics Tools window etc. However, to evaluate whether a conditional breakpoint’s conditions have been met, we need only a subset of that information. Now we fetch only the necessary pieces of information.\nWith these optimizations in place, we measured up to ~67% reduction in debugger overhead in a test application compared to 17.10.\nOptimized Symbol Search for C++ language service\nIn 17.11 we reimplemented the text indexing system for C++ symbols. Before this change, C++ language service processed the symbol text directly to answer All-in-one-Search (AIOS) queries. We would load all the text into memory and traverse it to find matching candidates. This approach was relatively fast, but not optimal; not to mention having to keep the text cached in memory. In 17.11 we started using SQLite’s FTS5 search extension. The index is computed when the solution is parsed after it is opened, and then the language service can perform Symbol Search without any additional loading of text into memory. All the results are available faster and with less memory usage: we’ve seen the slower AIOS symbol searches up to 65% faster in 17.11. We hope you’re experiencing this improvement in your larger codebases.\nShare your feedback and stay connected with Visual Studio!\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ever wished to assess your code’s performance without repeatedly choosing the target process or executable for each instrumentation profiling session? If so, you’re among many developers who find this task cumbersome and prone to errors, especially when profiling the same target repeatedly.\nWe understand your frustration and have a solution: Visual Studio 2022 introduces a new feature that addresses this issue. The instrumentation tool now remembers your target selection across runs, providing a seamless experience and enhancing the continuity of your profiling sessions.\n\nWith this improvement, you can maintain your specified target across multiple instrumentation runs, eliminating the need for repetitive selection tasks. This means you can focus more on analyzing the performance data and optimizing your code, rather than wasting time and effort on setting up the profiling session.\nHow does it work?\nTo use this feature, you need to have Visual Studio installed and the Performance Profiler (ALT+F2) enabled. Then, follow these simple steps:\nLaunch the Performance Profiler and select Instrumentation as the profiling method.\nClick the Target button and choose the process or executable you want to profile.\nClick Start to begin the profiling session. Visual Studio will collect and display the performance data in the Diagnostic Tools window.\nWhen you’re done, click Stop to end the profiling session. Visual Studio will show you a summary of the results and allow you to drill down into the details.\nClick cancel in the dialog box to reset the persisted selection.\nIf you want to run another instrumentation profiling session on the same target, you don’t need to select it again. Just click Start and Visual Studio will remember your last choice and use it as the default target. When you add a new method, class, or project, these new targets are automatically selected based on whether their parent was previously selected. This proactive approach ensures that no new additions are missed and helps maintain comprehensive profiling coverage.\nYou can still change the target if you want to, but you don’t have to.\n\nEnjoy the convenience and efficiency of persistent target selection!\nWhy should you use it?\nThis feature is designed to help you streamline your workflow and improve your productivity when using the instrumentation tool. By persisting the target selection between runs, you can:\nSave time and avoid frustration by reducing the number of clicks and interactions needed to set up a profiling session.\nMinimize the risk of selecting the wrong target or forgetting to select one, which could lead to inaccurate or missing performance data.\nMaintain consistency and comparability of the performance data across multiple profiling sessions on the same target.\nFocus more on the performance analysis and optimization of your code, rather than the configuration and management of the profiling session.\nConcluding thoughts\nWe hope you find this feature valuable for your development journey. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable to us as we strive to enhance it further. Please share your thoughts through the Visual Studio Developer Community or the Report a Problem tool in Visual Studio.\nThank you for choosing Visual Studio and for your continuous feedback that helps us make it better every day.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nThe post Effortless Instrumentation profiling with Persistent Target Selection appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/creating-a-react-todo-app-in-visual-studio-2022/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 26 Sep 2024 10:00:23 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "In this tutorial we will create a React front-end, with JavaScript, of a TODO web app using a Visual Studio 2022. To get started install Visual Studio with the Node.js development workload. This will include the JavaScript/TypeScript (JSTS) projects and the associated support. The code for this app can be found at sayedihashimi/todojswebapp (github.com). Create a new React project using the New Project Dialog in Visual Studio 2022. Use File > New > Project … to open that dialog. For this tutorial select the React App JavaScript template which is shown below.\n\nAfter clicking Next, give the project the name TodoWebApp and click Create. This will create the JavaScript project using the vite command line tool. Now create a new component to encapsulate the todo list functionality. First create a new folder named components under the src folder. This is the folder where all components will go. It’s a common convention to place components in a components folder, but this is not required. Right click on this new folder and select Add > React JSX Component File, give it the name TodoList as shown in the following image.\n\nThis will create a new jsx file in the components folder. For now, replace the Hello World content with the h2 as shown in the snippet below.\nfunction TodoList() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <h2>TODO app contents</h2>\r\n    );\r\n}\nThis component displays a header for now. We will replace this soon. Let’s wire up this component in the app and then later replace the contents with the desired functionality. Let’s add this component to the app and remove the boilerplate content that is no longer needed.\nOpen the App.jsx file. This is the main component that is loaded which represents the todo application. This is used in the main.jsx file. In App.jsx, remove all the imports from the top and clear out the contents of the return statement. The file should look like the snippet below.\nfunction App() {\r\n    return (\r\n\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App\nTo add the TodoList component, place your cursor inside the fragment and then type <TodoL RETURN. This will add the component and the import statement. You can see this in the below animation.\n\nNow let’s clear out the CSS files so that we can start with a fresh start. Open the App.css file and delete all the contents. In the Index.css file remove all contents except the styles for :root. The Index.css file should look like the following.\n:root {\r\n    font-family: Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\r\n    line-height: 1.5;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    color-scheme: light dark;\r\n    color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87);\r\n    background-color: #242424;\r\n}\nNow run the app to ensure that everything is working as expected. You can use the Start Debugging button from the toolbar or the F5 keyboard shortcut. After that a browser window should open with the following content.\n\nThis would be a good time to create a commit in case you need to roll back to a good state later. Now that you’ve started the app you can leave it running, as you make changes the app will automatically refresh with the latest content using the Hot Module Replacement support. Some actions like adding folders or renaming files will require that you stop debugging and then restart it but in general you can leave it running in the background as you develop your app. Open the TodoList.jsx component so that we can start to define that.\nIn TodoList.jsx first add the UI needed to show and manage todo entries and then hook it up to store the values after that. Update TodoList.jsx to have the following content.\nfunction TodoList() {\r\n    return (\r\n        <div>\r\n            <h1>TODO</h1>\r\n            <div>\r\n                <input\r\n                    type=\"text\"\r\n                    placeholder=\"Enter a task\"\r\n                    required\r\n                    aria-label=\"Task text\" />\r\n                <button className=\"add-button\" aria-label=\"Add task\" >\r\n                    Add\r\n                </button>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <ol id=\"todo-list\">\r\n                <p>existing tasks will be shown here</p>\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </div>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TodoList;\nWe have added an input box for the todo item as well as a button to submit that. The existing tasks will be displayed under the input and button, but we will get to that soon. Now that we have the input field to get a new task added, we will wire up the Add button. We will use the useState React hook to add two state variables, one for the task which is getting added and another to store the existing tasks. For this tutorial the tasks will be stored in memory we will not add a database for persistent storage. Add the following import statement to TodoList.jsx to import useState.\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nNow we can use that hook to create the state variables. Add the following code in the TodoList function above the return statement.\nconst [tasks, setTasks] = useState([\r\n    \"Drink some coffee\",\r\n    \"Create a TODO app\",\r\n    \"Drink some more coffee\"]);\r\n\r\nconst [newTaskText, setNewTaskText] = useState(\"\");\nThis will setup two variables, tasks and newTaskText, for the data and two functions that you can call to update those variables, setTasks and setNewTasks. When a value for a state variable is changed React will automatically re-render the component. We are almost ready to update TodoList.jsx to show the todo items as a list, but there is an important React concept that we must explain before doing so.\nIn React when you display a list of items you will need to add a key to uniquely identify each item in the list. This is explained in depth in the React docs at Rendering Lists, but we will cover what is needed for this tutorial. We have a list of todo items that we want to display, and we need to associate a unique key for each item, the key for each item should not change. Since the key for each item should not change, we cannot use the index of the item in the array as the key. We need an id which will not change through out the lifetime of those values. We will use randomUUID() to create a unique id for each todo item.\nNow let’s create TodoList.jsx using a uuid as the key for each todo item. Update TodoList.jsx to contain the following code.\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst initialTasks = [\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Drink some coffee' },\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Create a TODO app' },\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Drink some more coffee' }\r\n];\r\n\r\nfunction TodoList() {\r\n    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);\r\n    const [newTaskText, setNewTaskText] = useState(\"\");\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n        <article\r\n            className=\"todo-list\"\r\n            aria-label=\"task list manager\">\r\n            <header>\r\n                <h1>TODO</h1>\r\n                <form className=\"todo-input\" aria-controls=\"todo-list\">\r\n                    <input\r\n                        type=\"text\"\r\n                        placeholder=\"Enter a task\"\r\n                        value={newTaskText} />\r\n                    <button\r\n                        className=\"add-button\">\r\n                        Add\r\n                    </button>\r\n                </form>\r\n            </header>\r\n            <ol id=\"todo-list\" aria-live=\"polite\" aria-label=\"task list\">\r\n                {tasks.map((task, index) =>\r\n                    <li key={task.id}>\r\n                        <span className=\"text\">{task.text}</span>\r\n                    </li>\r\n                )}\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </article>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\nexport default TodoList;\nSince the id values are assigned outside the TodoList function, we can be sure the values will not change if the page is rerendered. When you try the app in this state, you will notice that you cannot type into the todo input element. This is because the input element is bound to newTaskText which has been initialized to a blank string. To allow users to add new tasks, we will need to handle the onChange event on that control. We also need to implement the Add button support. Add the functions immediately above the return statement in the TodoList function.\nfunction handleInputChange(event) {\r\n    setNewTaskText(event.target.value);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction addTask() {\r\n    if (newTaskText.trim() !== \"\") {\r\n        setTasks(t => [...t, { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: newTaskText }]);\r\n        setNewTaskText(\"\");\r\n    }\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n}\nIn the handleInputChanged function, the new value from the input field is passed in via event.target.value and that is used to update the value for the newTaskText variable with setNewTaskText. In the addTask function we add the new task to the list of existing tasks using setTasks and we set the id of the item as a new uuid value. Update the input element to include onChange={handleInputChange} and update the Add button to include onClick={addTask}. This will wire up the event to the function that handles that event. Following this you should be able to add a new task to the task list. New tasks are added to the bottom of the list. To make this app more useful, we need to add support to delete tasks and to move a task up or down. Let’s get started on that.\nWe will add the functions to support delete, move up and move down and then update the markup to show a button for each action. Add the following in the TodoList function above the return statement.\nfunction deleteTask(id) {\r\n    const updatedTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.id != id);\r\n    setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction moveTaskUp(index) {\r\n    if (index > 0) {\r\n        const updatedTasks = [...tasks];\r\n        [updatedTasks[index], updatedTasks[index - 1]] = [updatedTasks[index - 1], updatedTasks[index]];\r\n        setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction moveTaskDown(index) {\r\n    if (index < tasks.length) {\r\n        const updatedTasks = [...tasks];\r\n        [updatedTasks[index], updatedTasks[index + 1]] = [updatedTasks[index + 1], updatedTasks[index]];\r\n        setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n    }\r\n}\nThe delete function takes in the task id and deletes that one from the list and uses the Array filter() method to create a new array excluding the selected item and then calls setTasks(). The other two functions take in the index of the item since this is specific to the item ordering. Both moveTaskUp() and moveTaskDown() use array destructuring assignment to swap the selected task with its neighbor. Now we will update the view to include these buttons. Update the return statement to contain the following.\nreturn (\r\n    <article\r\n        className=\"todo-list\"\r\n        aria-label=\"task list manager\">\r\n        <header>\r\n            <h1>TODO</h1>\r\n            <form className=\"todo-input\" onSubmit={addTask} aria-controls=\"todo-list\">\r\n                <input\r\n                    type=\"text\"\r\n                    required\r\n                    autoFocus\r\n                    placeholder=\"Enter a task\"\r\n                    value={newTaskText}\r\n                    aria-label=\"Task text\"\r\n                    onChange={handleInputChange} />\r\n                <button\r\n                    className=\"add-button\"\r\n                    aria-label=\"Add task\">\r\n                    Add\r\n                </button>\r\n            </form>\r\n        </header>\r\n        <ol id=\"todo-list\" aria-live=\"polite\">\r\n            {tasks.map((task, index) =>\r\n                <li key={task.id}>\r\n                    <span className=\"text\">{task.text}</span>\r\n                    <button className=\"delete-button\" onClick={() => deleteTask(task.id)}>\r\n                        \r\n                    </button>\r\n                    <button className=\"up-button\" onClick={() => moveTaskUp(index)}>\r\n                        ⇧\r\n                    </button>\r\n                    <button className=\"down-button\" onClick={() => moveTaskDown(index)}>\r\n                        ⇩\r\n                    </button>\r\n                </li>\r\n            )}\r\n        </ol>\r\n    </article>\r\n);\nWe have added the buttons needed to perform the tasks we discussed above. We are using Unicode characters as icons on the buttons. In the markup there are some attributes added for when we add some CSS later. You will also notice the use of aria attributes to improve accessibility, the are optional but highly recommended. If you run the app it should look like the image below.\n\nYou should now be able to perform the following in the TODO web app.\nAdd task\nDelete task\nMove task up\nMove task down\nThis is working well, but we can refactor this so that we have a reusable component to display the todo items. The markup for the todo item will go into a new component, TodoItem. Since the management of the list will stay in the Todo component, we will pass callbacks to the delete and move buttons. To get started, right click the components folder in the Solution Explorer and select Add > New Item. In the dialog that opens select the React JSX Component File. Give it the name TodoItem and click Add. We will pass in the task and callbacks as props to this new component. The TodoItem should contain the following code.\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types';\r\n\r\nfunction TodoItem({ task, deleteTaskCallback, moveTaskUpCallback, moveTaskDownCallback }) {\r\n    return (\r\n        <li aria-label=\"task\" >\r\n            <span className=\"text\">{task}</span>\r\n            <button\r\n                type=\"button\"\r\n                aria-label=\"Delete task\"\r\n                className=\"delete-button\"\r\n                onClick={() => deleteTaskCallback()}>\r\n                \r\n            </button>\r\n            <button\r\n                type=\"button\"\r\n                aria-label=\"Move task up\"\r\n                className=\"up-button\"\r\n                onClick={() => moveTaskUpCallback()}>\r\n                ⇧\r\n            </button>\r\n            <button\r\n                type=\"button\"\r\n                aria-label=\"Move task down\"\r\n                className=\"down-button\"\r\n                onClick={() => moveTaskDownCallback()}>\r\n                ⇩\r\n            </button>\r\n        </li>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nTodoItem.propTypes = {\r\n    task: PropTypes.string.isRequired,\r\n    deleteTaskCallback: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n    moveTaskUpCallback: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n    moveTaskDownCallback: PropTypes.func.isRequired,\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TodoItem;\nThe code above contains the markup from the Todo component and at the bottom we declare the propTypes. Props are used to pass data from a parent component to child components. For more info on props the docs are available at Passing Props to a Component – React. Since the delete and move functions are being passed in as callbacks, the onClick handler will need to be updated to call into those callbacks. The full code for TodoList is below that uses the TodoItem component.\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\r\nimport TodoItem from './TodoItem'\r\n\r\nconst initialTasks = [\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Drink some coffee' },\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Create a TODO app' },\r\n    { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: 'Drink some more coffee' }\r\n];\r\n\r\nfunction TodoList() {\r\n    const [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks);\r\n    const [newTaskText, setNewTaskText] = useState(\"\");\r\n    function handleInputChange(event) {\r\n        setNewTaskText(event.target.value);\r\n    }\r\n    function addTask() {\r\n        if (newTaskText.trim() !== \"\") {\r\n            setTasks(t => [...t, { id: self.crypto.randomUUID(), text: newTaskText }]);\r\n            setNewTaskText(\"\");\r\n        }\r\n        event.preventDefault();\r\n    }\r\n    function deleteTask(id) {\r\n        const updatedTasks = tasks.filter(task => task.id !== id);\r\n        setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n    }\r\n    function moveTaskUp(index) {\r\n        if (index > 0) {\r\n            const updatedTasks = [...tasks];\r\n            [updatedTasks[index], updatedTasks[index - 1]] = [updatedTasks[index - 1], updatedTasks[index]];\r\n            setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    function moveTaskDown(index) {\r\n        if (index < tasks.length) {\r\n            const updatedTasks = [...tasks];\r\n            [updatedTasks[index], updatedTasks[index + 1]] = [updatedTasks[index + 1], updatedTasks[index]];\r\n            setTasks(updatedTasks);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return (\r\n        <article\r\n            className=\"todo-list\"\r\n            aria-label=\"task list manager\">\r\n            <header>\r\n                <h1>TODO</h1>\r\n                <form onSubmit={addTask} aria-controls=\"todo-list\">\r\n                    <input\r\n                        type=\"text\"\r\n                        required\r\n                        placeholder=\"Enter a task\"\r\n                        value={newTaskText}\r\n                        aria-label=\"Task text\"\r\n                        onChange={handleInputChange} />\r\n                    <button\r\n                        className=\"add-button\"\r\n                        aria-label=\"Add task\">\r\n                        Add\r\n                    </button>\r\n                </form>\r\n            </header>\r\n            <ol id=\"todo-list\" aria-live=\"polite\">\r\n                {tasks.map((task, index) =>\r\n                    <TodoItem\r\n                        key={task.id}\r\n                        task={task.text}\r\n                        deleteTaskCallback={() => deleteTask(task.id)}\r\n                        moveTaskUpCallback={() => moveTaskUp(index)}\r\n                        moveTaskDownCallback={() => moveTaskDown(index)}\r\n                    />\r\n                )}\r\n            </ol>\r\n        </article>\r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default TodoList;\nNow the TodoItem component is used to render each todo item. Notice that we set the key to task.id which contains the uuid value for that task. When you run the app, you shouldn’t see any changes to the look or behavior of the app since we refactored it to use TodoItem. Let’s move on to styling.\nNow that we have all the basic functions supported, it’s time to start adding some styling to this to make it look nice. Now would be a good time to create a commit to save your progress. Let’s first start by adding a link in the Index.html for a font family, Inter, that we will use for this app. In the Index.html there are some other items that need to be cleaned up. Specifically, the title should be updated and vite.svg file is still being used as the icon. Update the Index.html file to have the following content.\n<!doctype html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n    <head>\r\n        <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\r\n        <link rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/checkmark-square.svg\" />\r\n        <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\r\n        <title>TODO app</title>\r\n        <link href='https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Inter' rel='stylesheet'>\r\n        <script type=\"module\" defer src=\"/src/main.jsx\"></script>\r\n    </head>\r\n    <body>\r\n    </body>\r\n</html>\nEdit the main.jsx file to replace ‘root’ with ‘main’ when calling createRoot the full content for that file is below.\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\r\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\r\nimport App from './App.jsx'\r\nimport './index.css'\r\n\r\ncreateRoot(document.querySelector('main')).render(\r\n    <StrictMode>\r\n        <App />\r\n    </StrictMode>,\r\n)\nIn addition to these changes the file checkmark-square.svg was added to the public folder. This is an SVG from the FluentUI checkmark square image which I downloaded directly. There is a package that you can use for a more integrated experience but that’s outside the scope of this post.\nNow let’s update the styles of the TodoList component. In the components folder add a new CSS file named TodoList.css. You can right click on the project and select Add > New Item and then select Style Sheet. Give the file the name TodoList.css. Add the following to TodoList.css.\n.todo-list {\r\n    background-color: #1e1e1e;\r\n    padding: 1.25rem;\r\n    border-radius: 0.5rem;\r\n    box-shadow: 0 0.25rem 0.5rem rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);\r\n    width: 100%;\r\n    max-width: 25rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list h1 {\r\n    text-align: center;\r\n    color: #e0e0e0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-input {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: space-between;\r\n    margin-bottom: 1.25rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-input input {\r\n    flex: 1;\r\n    padding: 0.625rem;\r\n    border: 0.0625rem solid #333;\r\n    border-radius: 0.25rem;\r\n    margin-right: 0.625rem;\r\n    background-color: #2c2c2c;\r\n    color: #e0e0e0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-input .add-button {\r\n    padding: 0.625rem 1.25rem;\r\n    background-color: #007bff;\r\n    color: #fff;\r\n    border: none;\r\n    border-radius: 0.25rem;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-input .add-button:hover {\r\n    background-color: #0056b3;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list ol {\r\n    list-style-type: none;\r\n    padding: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    justify-content: space-between;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    padding: 0.625rem;\r\n    border-bottom: 0.0625rem solid #333;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li:last-child {\r\n    border-bottom: none;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list .text {\r\n    flex: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li button {\r\n    background: none;\r\n    border: none;\r\n    cursor: pointer;\r\n    font-size: 1rem;\r\n    margin-left: 0.625rem;\r\n    color: #e0e0e0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li button:hover {\r\n    color: #007bff;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li button.delete-button {\r\n    color: #ff4d4d;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.todo-list li button.up-button,\r\n.todo-list li button.down-button {\r\n    color: #4caf50;\r\n}\nAfter that edit TodoList.jsx to add the following import at the top of the file.\nimport './TodoList.css';\nRefresh the browser after saving the changes. This should improve the styling of the app. The app should look like the following screenshot.\n\nNow you have built a working Todo app which stores the todo items in memory. From here you could update the app to store the todo items in localStorage/IndexedDb, or integrate this with a server-side database, or other backend, for more permanent storage.\nRecap\nIn this tutorial you have created a new React app using Visual Studio 2022. The app consists of a todo list, which includes support to add tasks, delete tasks and to reorder them.

For example, you can enable or disable all breakpoints in a group or set conditions and actions for them or even make the whole group dependent on other breakpoints.\nBut that’s not all. You can also mark the selected breakpoint group as the default, ensuring all newly added breakpoints are automatically included in that group. This enhancement simplifies the management and organization of breakpoints, providing seamless debugging when investigating multiple issues.\nRecap: Breakpoint groups\nTo create a breakpoint group, right-click on any breakpoint in the Breakpoints window and select Add to Group > New Group. You can name the group and add a description if you want.\n\nTo add more breakpoints to the group, simply drag and drop them from the Breakpoints window or use the right-click menu. To remove breakpoints from the group, drag and drop them outside the group or use the right-click menu. You can also delete the group, which will remove all the breakpoints in the group from your project.\nDefault Breakpoint Group\nTo set a breakpoint group as the default, simply right-click on the group and choose “Set as Default Group.” The default group will be distinctly labeled in bold, making it easy to identify. When you have a default breakpoint group, any new breakpoints you add to your code will automatically be added to that group. This ensures that your breakpoints are organized consistently, without the need to manually sort them each time you add new ones.\nIf your needs change, you can easily move breakpoints to a different group at any time. This flexibility allows you to adapt your breakpoint organization as your project evolves. You can change the default group at any time or clear it altogether.\n\nYou can access all the breakpoint group actions from the right-click menu or the toolbar in the Breakpoints window.\nTry it out today\nWe hope you find the breakpoint group feature useful and productive. It’s one of the many improvements we’ve made to the debugging experience in Visual Studio 2022, thanks to your feedback and suggestions.\nPlease download the latest version of Visual Studio and try it out. Stay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nReport any issues or suggestions via Help > Send Feedback.\nLearn more about other Copilot assisted features in Visual Studio by checking out additional resources Debug with GitHub Copilot – Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nThe post Organize Your Breakpoints like a pro appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Cloud Infra의 IaC 도구로 잘 알려진 Terraform을 On-Premise 환경에서 사용하려면 On-Prem Cloud를 위한 Terraform Provider 가 제공되어야 한다. \n이 글에서는 IaC 도구인 Terraform이 무엇인지 간단히 소개하고, Hashicorp에서 새로이 제공하는 Plugin Framework을 이용해 Terraform Provider를 만들 때 기존과 달라진 것들을 \b기술하려 한다.\nBrief history of Terraform\n  2021년 7월 8일은 Terraform의 첫 메이저 버전 1.0이 릴리즈된 날이다. 같은 날 Hashicorp 홈페이지에 공개된 글 “The Story of HashiCorp Terraform with Mitchell Hashimoto”와  유튜브 영상 “The Making of HashiCorp Terraform with Mitchell Hashimoto”에는 Hashimoto가 Terraform을 만들기까지의 여정이 담겨있다.\n2011년, AWS가 CloudFormation을 출시했을 때 미첼은 AWS 리소스를 코드로 모델링하고 프로비저닝한다는 아이디어에 큰 감명을 받았다. 하지만 그는 AWS에 국한되지 않고 여러 클라우드 플랫폼에서 사용할 수 있는 범용적인 인프라스트럭처 관리 도구가 필요하다고 생각했다.\n이 아이디어를 바탕으로 미첼은 Tumblr에 블로그 포스트를 작성했다.(원본은 찾을 수 없으며, GitHub에 아카이브가 남겨져 있다. 링크: CloudFormation: The Big Picture) 그는 이 포스트에서 오픈소스 기반의 Cloud-Agnostic Infrastructure as Code 솔루션의 필요성을 언급하며, 누군가가 이 문제를 해결해주기를 바랐다. 사실상 Terraform의 아이디어를 공개적으로 제안한 셈.\nCloudFormation은 Declarative Language를 기반으로 한 인프라 프로비저닝 도구로, 당시 유행하던 Chef나 Puppet과는 Orchestration의 첫 단계를 시작하고 구성한다는 점에서 다르다.\n하지만 CloudFormation은 인프라를 점진적으로 개선하고 재구성할 수 있는 방법을 제공하지 않는다.\n또한 오픈소스이자 특정 벤더 종속성이 없는 Cloud-Agnostic Solution이 필요하다.\n출처: 침하하\n\n\n\n그러나 몇 년이 지나도 아무도 이 아이디어를 실현하지 않았다. 그 사이 미첼이 예측했던 인프라 관리의 문제점들이 현실화되기 시작했고, 결국 그는 직접 이 문제를 해결하기로 결심했다.(누군가는 해야  하잖아?) 2014년 7월, 미첼과 그의 팀은 Terraform 0.1 버전을 출시했는데, 이는 그가 2011년 블로그에서 제안했던 바로 그 아이디어를 구현한 것이었다. 초기 버전의 Terraform은 AWS와 DigitalOcean만을 지원했지만, 점차 다른 인프라에도 확장될 수 있도록 개선되었다.\nTerraform의 초기 18개월 동안은 다운로드 수가 거의 정체되어 있었으며, 심지어 프로젝트를 중단할 것인지에 대한 논의도 있었다고 한다. 하지만 미첼과 그의 팀은 Terraform의 잠재력을 믿었고, 특히 에코시스템의 중요성을 인식했기 때문에,\bTerraform Provider를 쉽게 작성하고 사용할 수 있도록 하는 데 집중했다.\n생태계를 중요하게 여겼던 미첼의 인사이트는 틀리지 않았다. 2016년 말까지 Terraform은 750명 이상의 기여자와 수십 개의 Provider를 확보했고, 다운로드 수가 매월 두 배씩 증가하기 시작했다.(현재는 1000여 개 이상의 Terraform Provier가 Teraform Registry에 등재되어 있다.)\n2017년은 미첼이 “Terraform의 해”라고 부를 정도로 중요한 해였다. 마이크로소프트와의 첫 주요 클라우드 파트너십을 발표했는데, 이는 대형 클라우드 제공업체가 공개적으로 Terraform을 인정하고 지원한 첫 사례였다.\nTerraform은 현재 1억 회 이상의 다운로드를 기록한 인기 있는 도구로 성장했다. 미첼의 단순한 아이디어에서 시작된 Terraform과 IaC가 이제는 인프라 관리의 표준으로 자리 잡은 것.\nTerraform 주요 특징\n위 일화에서 언급되었듯, Terraform은 IaC의 원칙을 기반으로 클라우드 인프라를 관리하고 배포하는데 사용된다. 주요 특징은 다음과 같다.\n클라우드 중립성\nTerraform은 멀티 클라우드 환경을 지원한다. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud와 같은 여러 클라우드 서비스 제공자의 인프라를 한 곳에서 코드로 관리할 수 있으며, 기업은 특정 클라우드 벤더에 종속되지 않고, 유연한 인프라 관리를 할 수 있게 된다.\nDeclarative Infrastructure Provisioning\nTerraform은 내가 원하는 최종 상태를 정의하면 인프라를 그 상태에 달성하도록 변경한다. 작업 절차의 서순이 바뀌었기 때문에 원치 않는 결과를 초래하는 일은 없다. \nDeclarative Provisioning을 위해 Terraform은 HCL이라는 언어로 인프라 리소스를 표현한다.(링크: Terraform Language Documentation)\nPlan & Apply\nTerraform의 핵심적인 기능 중 하나는 plan과 apply다. terraform plan 명령어를 통해 현재 설정과 미래의 변경 사항을 비교하고, 인프라 변경이 시스템에 어떤 영향을 미칠지 사전에 예측할 수 있다. 이를 통해 변경 사항을 안전하게 적용할 수 있다.\nState\nTerraform은 인프라의 현재 상태를 파일로 관리하여, 코드에서 정의된 리소스와 실제 인프라 리소스를 동기화한다. 이 상태 파일은 클라우드 리소스 변경을 추적하고 관리하는 데 중요한 역할을 하며, 팀 간 협업 시에도 일관된 상태를 유지할 수 있게 해준다.\n모듈화 및 재사용성\nTerraform은 코드의 모듈화를 지원하여 복잡한 인프라를 여러 모듈로 나눠 관리할 수 있다. 모듈화를 통해 인프라의 각 부분을 독립적으로 정의하고 재사용할 수 있어, 유지보수성과 확장성이 크게 향상된다.\nTerraform Registry는 써드파티에서 만든 수많은 모듈을 검색하고 적용할 수 있도록 하여 인프라 리소스 관리 코드의 재사용이 가능하도록 돕는다.\nOn-Premise Cloud를 위한 Terraform Provider 만들기\n현재 Terraform은 IaC의 de-facto 표준 격이어서 대부분의 Public Cloud에서 사용이 가능하다. 하지만 당신의 회사에 On-Premise Cloud가 구축되어 있다면 이 Infrastructure를 Terraform으로 제어하기 위해 Terraform Provider를 직접 만들어야 한다. 걱정하지 마라. Hashicorp는 당신이 Provider를 손쉽게 작성할 수 있도록 친절하게 tutorial을 준비해 두었다.(링크: Call APIs with Custom Framework Providers)\n이 예제는 Terraform Provider 개발자가 구현해야 할 주요요소들을 완결성 있게 배울 수 있도록 돕는다. 예제에서 작성한 Provider를 동작시켜볼 수 있도록 간단한 테스트 API 서버를 Docker로 제공하기 때문에 처음 Terraform을 사용하는 사람도 동작을 이해하기 쉬울 것이다. 총 13개의 tutorial이 존재하며, 각 tutorial 마다 학습 예상시간이 표기되어 있는데, 모든 tutorial을 마치기까지 대략 2~3시간 정도 걸린다.\nPre-requisites\nTerraform Provider를 개발하려면 다음을 준비하여야 한다.\nTerraform CLI(링크: Install Terraform)\ngo 언어 개발환경\nInfrastructure를 제어할 수 있는 Web API 및 go 언어용 API client\n(optional) Private Terraform Registry\n\n여건이 허락된다면 Public Registry 써도 무방\nPrivate Terraform Registry\n필자가 다니는 회사의 On-Premise Cloud는 격리된 사설망에 존재한다. 회사 방침상 Public Registry 사용이 어려우므로 Private Registry를 직접 구성하였다. 만일 여러분의 엔터프라이즈 환경이 필자와 유사하게 폐쇄적이라면 직접 Private Registry를 구성하여야 한다.\nProvider Registry Protocol을 준수하는 Registry Server를 손수 구현(링크: Provider Registry Protocol)할 수도 있지만, 특별한 이유가 없다면 누군가 구현해놓은 Opensource Private Registry를 사용하자.\n다음은 필자가 검토하였던 Private Registry 목록이다.\nCitizen(링크: https://github.com/outsideris/citizen)\nTerustry(링크: https://github.com/veepee-oss/terustry)\nTerrakube(링크: https://github.com/AzBuilder/terrakube)\nCitizen은 유튜브 채널 44BITS와 양질의 블로그로 유명하신 개발자 Outsider 님이 만드셨다. Terustry는 이름에서 알 수 있듯, rust로 구현한 프로젝트이고, Terrakube는 k8s 환경에서 동작하며 Registry 뿐 아니라 Custom Flow 주입 / State 가시화 / Schedule 관리 / Team 관리 등, Terraform Enterprise 의 대안으로 사용할 만한 오픈소스 서비스이다.\n이 중에서 필자는 Terustry로 Registry를 구성하였다. 아쉽게도 Citizen은 현 시점 Runtime error 가 발생하여 정상적인 실행이 되지 않아 사용해보지 못했다. Terrakube는 기능이 강력하기 때문에 적절한 시점이 되면 제대로 리뷰를 진행할 예정이다. 아직 필자의 진행단계에서는 과하다는 생각이 든다.\nTerustry는 GitHub 에 Release된 Artifact를 Provider로 제공하기 때문에 별도의 스토리지가 필요하지 않다. GitHub Release만 잘 관리하면 되기에 운영 cost가 낮고 구성이 쉬운 장점이 선택의 이유가 되었다.\nTerraform Plugin Framework(vs SDKv2)\n필자가 Terraform Provider를 개발을 위해 참고하였던 프로젝트들은 다음과 같다.\nTerraform Provider AWS\nTerraform Provider Azure\nTerraform Provider NCloud\n이 프로젝트들은 오래 전부터 Provider를 제공하였기에 Terraform Plugin SDKv2 로 개발이 되었는데, Hashicorp는 SDKv2 대신 새로이 제공하는 Plugin Framework로 개발할 것을 권장하고 있다. 심지어 가능하다면 SDKv2에서 Framework로 마이그레이션 할 것을 추천하고 있는 실정이다. 과연 Framework는 SDKv2에 비해 어떤 점이 개선되었을까?\nTerraform Plugin Protocol Version 6 지원\nTerraform Plugin Protocol이란 Terraform CLI와 Plugin 사이에 정의된, 버전관리되는 인터페이스이다.(링크: Terraform Plugin Protocol)\nv6에서는 NestedAttributes를 지원한다. 기존의 Block Syntax에 비해 간결한 표현이 가능한 Argument Syntax를 사용할 수 있다. 예를 들면 다음과 같은 block syntax를 argument syntax로 표현할 수 있다.\nresource \"example_network\" \"test\" {\n  name = \"example-network\"\n\n  network_interface {\n    name = \"eth0\"\n    type = \"internal\"\n\n    ip_configuration {\n      ip_address = \"192.168.1.10\"\n      subnet     = \"subnet-1\"\n\n      dns_settings {\n        primary   = \"8.8.8.8\"\n        secondary = \"8.8.4.4\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n// network_interface block의 반복\n  network_interface {\n    name = \"eth1\"\n    type = \"external\"\n\n    ip_configuration {\n      ip_address = \"10.0.0.1\"\n      subnet     = \"subnet-2\"\n\n      dns_settings {\n        primary   = \"1.1.1.1\"\n        secondary = \"1.0.0.1\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nresource \"example_network\" \"test\" {\n  name = \"example-network\"\n  \n  // List Nested Attribute로 표현\n  network_interface = [\n    {\n      name = \"eth0\"\n      type = \"internal\"\n      ip_configuration = {\n        ip_address = \"192.168.1.10\"\n        subnet     = \"subnet-1\"\n        dns_settings = {\n          primary   = \"8.8.8.8\"\n          secondary = \"8.8.4.4\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      name = \"eth1\"\n      type = \"external\"\n      ip_configuration = {\n        ip_address = \"10.0.0.1\"\n        subnet     = \"subnet-2\"\n        dns_settings = {\n          primary   = \"1.1.1.1\"\n          secondary = \"1.0.0.1\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n기본 구조의 차이: 모듈화와 재사용성\nTerraform SDK에서는 리소스를 정의할 때 상대적으로 많은 boilerplate 코드가 필요하며, 개별적인 기능을 구현하는 데에도 반복되는 부분이 많다. 반면, Framework Plugin은 코드의 모듈화를 더 잘 지원하여 반복적인 작업을 줄이고 재사용성을 높이도록 개선하였다.\n예를 들어보자. SDK에서의 리소스 생성 방식은 보통 다음과 같이 많은 양의 Schema와 CRUD 관련 함수를 작성해야 했다.\nfunc resourceVirtualMachine() *schema.Resource {\n\treturn &schema.Resource{\n\t\tSchema: map[string]*schema.Schema{\n\t\t\t\"name\": {\n\t\t\t\tType:     schema.TypeString,\n\t\t\t\tRequired: true,\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"cpu\": {\n\t\t\t\tType:     schema.TypeInt,\n\t\t\t\tOptional: true,\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t\tCreate: resourceVirtualMachineCreate,\n\t\tRead:   resourceVirtualMachineRead,\n\t\tUpdate: resourceVirtualMachineUpdate,\n\t\tDelete: resourceVirtualMachineDelete,\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc resourceVirtualMachineCreate(d *schema.ResourceData, meta interface{}) error {\n        // 명시적인 name type assertion\n\tname := d.Get(\"name\").(string)\n\t// 가상 머신 생성 로직\n\treturn nil\n}\nCreate 함수 구현부를 보면, ResourceData d의 구성요소 name의 값을 string type으로 직접 변환한다. 나머지 Read / Update / Delete 함수에서도 name의 값을 string type으로 직접 변환하여야 하는 boilerplate  code 가 반복적으로 발생한다.\n또한 type assertion의 validity를 사용하는 쪽에서 매번 체크하여야 한다.\n반면, Framework는 다음과 같은 구조적 개선이 있다.\nAttributes 의 추가: Attribute란 encoder/decoder가 사전 정의된 type의 추상화이다.  Schema의 구성요소 Attribute만 잘 정의하면 Resource / Data source 의 데이터 변환 및 validation을 신경쓰지 않아도 된다.\nMetadata / Schema / CRUD 책임 분리\ncontext.Context를 통한 일관된 상태관리 및 에러처리\nfunc NewVirtualMachineResource() resource.Resource {\n\treturn &VirtualMachineResource{}\n}\n\ntype VirtualMachineResource struct {\n\tresource.Resource\n}\n\nfunc (r *VirtualMachineResource) Metadata(_ context.Context, req resource.MetadataRequest, resp *resource.MetadataResponse) {\n\tresp.TypeName = \"example_virtual_machine\"\n}\n\nfunc (r *VirtualMachineResource) Schema(_ context.Context, _ resource.SchemaRequest, resp *resource.SchemaResponse) {\n\tresp.Schema = schema.Schema{\n\t\tAttributes: map[string]schema.Attribute{\n                        // name StringAttribute는 string assertion을 신경쓰지 않아도 됨\n\t\t\t\"name\": schema.StringAttribute{\n\t\t\t\tRequired: true,\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\"cpu\": schema.IntAttribute{\n\t\t\t\tOptional: true,\n\t\t\t},\n\t\t},\n\t}\n}\n\nfunc (r *VirtualMachineResource) Create(ctx context.Context, req resource.CreateRequest, resp *resource.CreateResponse) {\n\tvar data VirtualMachine\n\tdiags := req.Plan.Get(ctx, &data)\n\tresp.Diagnostics.Append(diags...)\n\n\t// 가상 머신 생성 로직\n}\nTerraform Provider Tutorial\n공식 Tutorial 링크 https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/providers-plugin-framework\n이런 저런 이야기를 하다보니 예상보다 글이 길어져서 Terraform Provider 개발은 다음 글에서 다룰까 한다. 위의 공식 Tutorial을 따라하면서 Go 개발환경을 구성하여 나만의 Provider 개발하는 방법을 소개하겠다.\n결론\nTerraform Provider를 만들 일이 많지는 않겠지만, 혹시라도 Terraform Provider를 만들어야 할 경우 이 글이 도움이 되길 바란다.",

(굉장히 간단할 것이라고 생각했습니다.)\n \nSet 자료구조에 Key로 상품번호를 넣고, Value에 사용자 인식 정보를 넣는다면\nex (key = \"123456789\", value=\"rlanwl\")\n사용자는 중복되지 않을 것이고, Insert, Select 시간 복잡도 O(1) 성능 이슈 X\n앱은 라이프 사이클에 따라 웹은 브라우저 종료 감지로 사용자 이탈 시 제거하면 럭키 비키합니다.\n \n현실:\n파이어 폭스 같은 브라우저는 자바스크립트의 종료 감지 이벤트가 안될 수 있습니다.\n네트워크 이슈로 종료 감지를 못하면?\nSet에 저장된 데이터는 영영 삭제되지 않는 문제가 있습니다.\n유감.\n \nSet (2)\n위와 같은 방식으로 저장하되 각 키에 ExpireTime (60초)를 설정\n그럴 경우 만약 1번 상품에 대하여 60초 동안 아무도 안 본다면 1번 상품을 레디스에서 삭제.\n레디스에서 삭제가 되려면 60초 동안 각 상품을 안 봐야 하는데... 새벽에나 가능하지 않을까\n또한 최대한 사용자 수를 동기화를 해야 하는데 너무 오차가 크다는 문제가 있습니다.\n유감.\n \nSet X Hash\n가정:\nSet 자료구조에 Key로 상품번호를 넣고, Value에 사용자 인식 정보를 넣고..\nHash에는 모든 상품과 사용자 정보, 현재 시간을 넣어서 별도의 Batch을 통해 이탈 감지 실패한 케이스들을 삭제합니다.\nInsert, Select 시간복잡도 O(1)\n \n현실:\nHash에 저장된 데이터를 Batch 을 통해 지울 경우 모든 상품을 검사하며\n저장된 모든 유저들의 저장시간을 비교해야 하는데\n해시에 저장된 모든 키 조회로 인한 레디스 부하 -> 시간 복잡도: O(N) (Hash의 필드 수)\n키 리스트를 순회하며 유저 조회 후 날짜 비교 어플리케이션 부하\nSorted Set\n가정:\nSorted Set에는 Key, Value, Score을 저장할 수 있으니\nKey에는 상품번호, Value에는 사용자 인식 정보, Score에는 현재 시간을 저장합니다. -> 시간 복잡도 O(log n)\n중복된 Value를 허용하지 않으며 동일한 데이터 입력 시 Score를 업데이트할 수 있습니다.\n \n현재 상품을 몇 명이 보고 있는지는 해당 Key에 저장된 길이를 구하면 됩니다. -> 시간 복잡도 O(1)\n또한 Sorted Set에는 ZREMRANGEBYSCORE라는 명령어가 있는데 이 것을 활용하면\n일정 시간 동안 Score가 업데이트되지 않은 사용자 정보를 제거 할 수 있습니다.\n \n현실:\n가장 이상적인 자료구조 조합이지만\nBatch를 돌려서 일정 시간 동안 Score가 업데이트 되지 않은 사용자 정보를 제거해야 하는데\nSortedSet에 저장된 모든 키를 다 찾아야 합니다. => ZRANGE 시간 복잡도 O(log n + m)\n그 키 별로 ZREMRANGEBYSCORE 명령어를 실행해야 하기 때문에 => 시간 복잡도 O(log n + m)\n \n총 시간 복잡도는 O(log n + m) + 상품 수 * O(log n + m)으로 레디스의 부하가 예상되나\nSortedSet에 저장된 상품별 사용자 정보에서 얼마나 많은 수의 이탈 감지 실패가 발생했는지가 관건\nBatch도 언제 돌릴지가 관건이었습니다.\n(하지만 이탈 감지 실패는 그렇게 많지 않을 것으로 보이기 때문에 이 자료구조를 선택하였습니다.)\n \n위 Set  X Hash 구조와 성능적으로는 크게 차이가 나지 않지만 확실히 SortedSet 자료구조가 가져다주는 편리한 이점이 있어서 해당 기능을 사용하였습니다.\nMongoDB\n이번에는 몽고 DB에서는 어떨지 살펴보았습니다.\n\n\nMongoDB는 고성능, 고가용성 및 쉬운 확장성을 제공하는 NoSQL, Document 지향 데이터베이스입니다.\n\n데이터를 배열 및 중첩 Document와 같은 복잡한 데이터 유형을 효율적으로 저장할 수 있는\n\n유연한 JSON과 유사한 형식인 BSON(Binary JSON)으로 저장합니다.\n \n몽고DB의 주요 특징으로는 스키마리스 구조, 고성능, 고가용성, 확장성 등이 있습니다.\n이러한 특징들은 개발자가 더 빠르고 유연하게 애플리케이션을 개발할 수 있게 돕습니다.\n\n왜냐하면 몽고DB는 동적 스키마를 지원하기 때문에, 애플리케이션의 데이터 구조가 변경되어도\n데이터베이스를 수정할 필요가 없습니다.\n이는 개발 시간을 단축시키는 큰 이점입니다.\n\n또한, 몽고DB는 내장된 샤딩 기능을 통해 데이터베이스의 수평 확장이 용이하며,\n이는 대규모 데이터베이스 관리에 필수적인 기능입니다.\n\n고가용성을 위한 복제 세트와 자동 장애 복구 기능은 몽고DB를 더욱 신뢰할 수 있는\n데이터 저장소로 만듭니다.\n\n왜냐하면 이러한 기능들은 데이터의 안정성과 서비스의 지속 가능성을 보장하기 때문입니다.\n \n몽고 디비에서는 아래와 같이 2가지 설계를 생각해 보았습니다.\n첫 번째, 다음과 같이 컬렉션 구조를 가져갔습니다.\nuserProductView\n{\n    itemNo: \"1\",\n    loginId: \"abcd\",\n    timestamp: \"2024-09-17T04:06:19.474+00:00\"\n}\n \nFlow는 다음과 같습니다.\nuserProductView -> 상품 별로 사용자 인식 정보와 현재 시간을 upsert한다. -> 시간 복잡도 O(log n)\n\n위 userProductView에 저장된 상품 번호 별 document 수를 구한다. -> 시간 복잡도 O(n)\n\n위 2번에서 구한 상품 별 ViewCount를 반환한다.\n이 구조는 생각보다 레디스보다 간단해 보이지만 숨은 내용이 있었습니다.\n검색 속도 개선을 위한 인덱스 설정\n몽고 디비를 사용할 경우 userProductView 컬렉션에 itemNo(상품 번호) 필드에 index를 걸어야 합니다.\n\n사용자 수 동기화를 위한 timestamp에 expire를 설정\n몽고 디비를 사용할 경우 각 도큐먼트 별로 expire를 설정할 수 있기 때문에\n레디스처럼 별도의 Job을 구성하여 이탈 감지 실패 케이스들에 대하여 검사를 할 필요가 없습니다.\n하지만 정확한 만료 시간 보장이 어렵다는 단점이 있으며, 성능 저하가 있을 수 있습니다.\n \n두 번째, 다음과 같이 하나의 컬렉션 구조를 가져갑니다.\n{\n    itemNo: \"1\",\n    \"users\": [\n        {\n            loginId: \"abcd\",\n            timestamp: \"2024-09-17T04:06:19.474+00:00\"\n        }    \n    ]\n}\n동작 Flow는 다음과 같습니다.\n상품 조회 => 인덱스가 있는 경우 O(log n) 또는 인덱스가 없는 경우 O(n)\n사용자가 상품을 조회할 때, 해당 itemNo에 대한 Document를 찾아야 합니다.\n사용자 정보를 users 배열에 추가하여 timestamp를 갱신합니다.\n해당 itemNo에 expire 설정\n\n상품에 속한 users 배열을 순회하며 특정 시간 기준으로 활동하지 않은 user라 판단하는 비교 로직을 수행해야 하므로, 배열의 크기에 따라 O(n)시간이 걸립니다.\n배열에 사용자 추가 => O(1)\n하지만 이 방식에도 문제가 있었습니다.\n상품 번호에 expire가 설정되어 있기 때문에 실제로 자주 보는 상품이라면 삭제가 되지 않을 수 있어서 데이터의 양이 엄청나게 커질 수 있습니다. 그럴 경우 상품 전체 조회 O(n) + user 배열 순회 O(n) + 배열 삭제 및 업데이트 O(n)\n\n이에 따라 또다시 Batch Job을 구성해 삭제해야 하는...\n어떤 게 더 좋은 거지?\n레디스와 몽고 DB를 전체 Flow에 시간복잡도를 비교해 보았을 때 테이블로 보면 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n해당 기능을 구현하기에 있어서 실시간이라는 점, 여러 도메인에 조회 기능을 제공해야 한다는 점에서 보면 성능적으로 레디스가 나을 듯합니다.\n하지만 레디스는 가격이 비싸다는 가장 큰 문제가 있습니다.\n \n복잡성과 유지보수면에서는 Batch Job이 없는 몽고 DB가 더 나아 보이지만,\n몽고 DB는 Index 설정, Expire 설정 등 따져야 할 게 몇 가지 있습니다.\n각 데이터베이스별로 장단점이 있어서 어떤 것을 사용하는 게 좋을지는 면밀히 검토해봐야 할 듯합니다.\n \n끝으로\n처음에는 간단할 것이라 판단하였지만 생각보다 따져볼 것이 많아 복잡했습니다.\n만들고 싶었던 기능을 이것저것 따져가며 여러 데이터베이스와 비교를 해보는 것도 꽤 재미있는 경험이 되었습니다.\n이제는 주니어보단 시니어 개발자에 가까운 연차가 되어가네요.\n꾸준히 노력하여 부끄럽지 않은 개발자가 되도록 하겠습니다.\n감사합니다.",

ESS의 핵심은 얼마나 오래 쓸 수 있는지(수명), 그리고 얼마나 많은 에너지를 저장할 수 있는지(용량) 입니다.\nESS 배터리의 수명은 충·방전 사이클에 의해 결정됩니다. 즉, 배터리가 얼마나 자주 충전되고 방전되는지가 수명에 큰 영향을 미치는 것이죠. 충전과 방전이 반복될수록 배터리 내부에 손상이 쌓이면서, 시간이 지나면 성능이 떨어지고 결국 더 이상 사용할 수 없게 됩니다. 이 때문에 ESS의 퀄리티를 판단할 때 많은 충·방전에도 오래 버틸 수 있다면 좋은 ESS라 보는 것이고요.\n또한 ESS는 전기차 배터리와는 다르게 총 용량이 더 중요합니다. 전기차 배터리는 차 안에 탑재되기 때문에 작고 가벼울수록 좋거든요. 그래서 에너지 밀도가 중요하죠. 하지만 ESS는 한 곳에 고정되어 설치되기 때문에, 무게나 크기에 구애받지 않습니다. 용량에 좀 더 중점을 둡니다. 전기차 배터리가 도시락이라면 ESS는 냉장고라고 생각하시면 쉬워요.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}테슬라의 ESS 청사진, 이미 앞서고 있는 플루언스에너지\n(한경비즈니스 2024.7.14)\n사실 시장의 주목을 이제 막 받았을 뿐 일론 머스크 최고경영자는 이미 ESS가 가진 성장 잠재력에 대해 높게 평가하고 있었다. 테슬라는 2006년부터 지금까지 세 차례에 걸쳐 마스터플랜을 공개했으며 그중 ESS에 대한 첫 언급이 나온 것은 마스터플랜2였다.\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}그리고 올해 1월에는 “수년 동안 ESS 사업이 자동차 사업보다 훨씬 빠르게 성장할 것이라고 강조했고 실제로도 그렇다”고 언급한 바 있다. 테슬라 사업부문별 실적을 비교해봐도 매출 증가율은 2022년 하반기, 마진은 2023년 하반기를 기점으로 메인인 자동차·서비스를 상회하는 강한 성장세를 보이고 있는 상황이다.\n이번 테슬라 ESS 설치량의 기록적인 증가는 10여 년 만에 ESS 시장의 극적인 확대를 기대해볼 수 있는 새로운 이정표가 나타났다는 점에서 그 의미가 있다. ESS는 가변성(시간), 간헐성(기상 조건) 등 친환경에너지 단점을 보완해줄 수 있는 장치인 만큼 ‘태양광+ESS’ 조합은 발전량 증가를 위한 가장 현실적인 방안이라고 판단하고 있다.\n미국 신규 발전용량 에너지원별 비중을 보면 최근 3년 동안 태양광, ESS 비중이 더불어 올라갔음을 확인할 수 있으며 정책 스탠스 또한 ESS 설치 확대를 지지하고 있다는 점에서 연내 관련 잠재력을 보다 높게 평가할 수 있을 것이라 판단한다.(중략)\n\n\n테슬라는 전기차로 유명한 회사이지만 오래 전부터 에너지 생산부터 저장, 그리고 판매까지 이어질 수 있도록 비즈니스를 준비해 왔습니다.\n2016년 태양광 전문업체 솔라시티를 인수하면서 태양광 발전으로 전력 생산을 직접 할 수 있게 됐고요.\n→ 생산된 전력을 저장할 수 있는 가정용 ESS ‘파워월’과 산업용 ESS ‘메가팩을’ 출시했습니다.\n→ 그리고 이 ESS로 전기차를 충전하고 전력 판매까지 가능하도록 만드는 AI 시스템을 개발하고 있어요.\n지난 7월, 1분기 실적 발표 시 일론 머스크는 “에너지 비즈니스는 다른 사업부 대비 고성장이다. 수요가 매우 강하며, 생산이 못 따라가고 있다. 미국 공장 가동률 향상과 중국 메가팩 공장 완공으로 에너지사업의 Capa는 2배 이상 향상될 것이다”라고 할 정도로 에너지 사업에 대한 의지를 보였는데요. 최근 전기차 시장이 캐즘(수요 정체기)에 접어든 후, 테슬라는 ESS 부문에 더 집중하고 있음을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\n이제 테슬라의 ESS 사업은 단순히 전기차를 보완하는 역할을 넘어, 앞으로는 회사의 핵심 성장 동력이 될 수도 있겠습니다.\n.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}삼성증권 테슬라 리포트에 의하면, 테슬라는 ESS 분야에서 많은 플레이어들과 협력하고 있고, 제품 라인 또한 매우 다양합니다. 자동차 분야와 마찬가지로 중국 업체와 가격 경쟁을 하고 있기 때문에, 경쟁력을 유지해야 하는 상황이고요.\n테슬라는 자체적으로 만든 전력 전자 장치 및 제어기능 소프트웨어까지 통합된 제품으로 ESS 제공하기 떄문에 강력한 가치를 제공하고 있습니다. 2025년 뿐 아니라 2026년까지도 주문이 쌓이고 있다고 해요.\n또한 전세계적으로 그리드(Grid: 에너지 수송 네트워크) 수요가 지속적으로 증가하면서, 새로운 기회를 맞이하고 있습니다. 한편으로는 AI 컴퓨터 측면에서 GPU에 대한 수요가 확인되면서, 데이터 센터와 저장 장치 측면에서도 새로운 시장이 열리고 있어요.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n캐즘(Chasm): 마케팅과 기술 채택 주기에서 중요한 개념. 신기술이나 혁신적인 제품이 초기 시장(얼리 어답터)에서 주류 시장(대중 소비자)으로 넘어가는 과정에서 발생하는 큰 간격을 의미해요. 이 용어는 제프리 무어의 책 『Crossing the Chasm』(1991년)에서 유래되었으며, 기술이 대중에게 확산되기 전에 겪는 어려운 단계, 즉 초기 수용자들과 대중 시장 간의 차이를 설명합니다.\n송전망: 발전소에서 생산된 전력을 각 지역의 소비자에게 전달하기 위한 고압 전력 전달 시스템. 발전소에서 생성된 전기는 매우 높은 전압으로 변환되어 송전망을 통해 장거리로 이동한 후, 각 지역에 도달하면 변전소에서 다시 저전압으로 변환되어 가정이나 산업 시설에 공급됩니다.\n2차전지: 재충전이 가능한 배터리. 방전 후에도 전기를 다시 충전하여 여러 번 사용할 수 있는 전지를 말해요. 주로 전기차, ESS(전기 저장 장치), 스마트폰과 같은 휴대용 전자기기 등에 사용되는데요. 친환경적이고 경제적인 장점 때문에 중요성이 더욱 커지고 있습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
