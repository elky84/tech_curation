        "content:encodedSnippet": "In November, we introduced C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot as a Private Preview, focusing on partnering with customers to tackle one of the common, taxing challenges for C++ development: refactoring at scale. Since then, we’ve listened to feedback and refined our tooling to make wide-sweeping C++ edits easier.\n“With C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio, we’ve seen noticeably better overall results, with fewer errors and faster processing on large projects.” – Software engineer (from our Private Preview)\n\nWe’re excited to announce that C++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot are now available to all C++ users in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nC++ code editing tools for GitHub Copilot\nRefactoring at scale is a time-consuming and error-prone process for C++ developers. Traditionally, developers relied on manual searches and incremental edits across multiple files to accomplish these tasks.\nWith these C++ code editing tools, Copilot goes beyond file searches and unlocks greater context-aware refactoring that enables changes across multiple files and sections.\nThe C++ code editing tools provide rich context for any symbol in your project, allowing Copilot agent mode to:\nView all references across your codebase\nUnderstand metadata such as type, declaration, and scope\nVisualize class inheritance hierarchies\nTrace function call chains\n\nThis helps Copilot accomplish complex editing tasks, reducing the traditionally manual effort required to perform refactoring tasks by improving the accuracy and speed of these operations.\nGetting started\nTo get started with these tools\nOpen your C++ project and ensure you have IntelliSense enabled\nNavigate to Tools > Options and turn on the visibility of the tools via GitHub > Copilot settings. You may need to close and re-open your solution for the tools to populate after this step.\n\nEnable any or all tools via the “Tools” icon in Copilot Chat\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Tool names and UI may evolve during the Public Preview and are subject to change.\nExample scenarios\nAll examples below were showcased using bullet3, an open-source C++ physics simulation engine.\n1. Add additional functionality to existing functions\nAs applications evolve, you often need to enhance existing functions without breaking current behavior. This can include adding logging or performance metrics.\nThese tools help the agent quickly identify all relevant references, ensuring complete and accurate updates for feature additions.\n\n2. Improve memory management\nInefficient memory handling leads to performance bottlenecks, excessive copies, and unclear ownership semantics. When making these updates, these tools can help identify all relevant references and ensure all type changes are updated to verify code compiles without errors.\n3. Visualizing unfamiliar code\nC++ code can often have intricate structures and dependency mapping. In a large, unfamiliar codebase, onboarding to a task can often be very time-consuming.\nThe C++ tools can help identify all relevant class structures and symbol information to produce a visualization of a given set of C++ symbols in a library or file, easing your onboarding process.\nBest practices\nChoose the right model for the job: Models that are optimized for tool-calling will perform best with our tools. To learn more about the models available, please visit these docs: AI model comparison – GitHub Docs\nBe specific with prompts: Being specific with prompts and breaking vague tasks into clear intent and context will improve the tool calling and performance. Specify symbols explicitly when possible.\nShare your feedback\nWe’d love to hear feedback on how we can improve the C++ tooling experience. Please report problems or suggest improvements through the Visual Studio feedback icon.\n\nWhat’s next\nWe’re looking to evolve our integration with Visual Studio tools and expand this support to other Copilot surfaces, like Visual Studio Code, to further empower agent-driven edits for C++.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Meta’s secure-by-default frameworks wrap potentially unsafe OS and third-party functions, making security the default while preserving developer speed and usability.\nThese frameworks are designed to closely mirror existing APIs, rely on public and stable interfaces, and maximize developer adoption by minimizing friction and complexity.\nGenerative AI and automation accelerate the adoption of secure frameworks at scale, enabling consistent security enforcement and efficient migration across Meta’s vast codebase.\nSometimes functions within operating systems or provided by third parties come with a risk of misuse that could compromise security. To mitigate this, we wrap or replace these functions using our own secure-by-default frameworks. These frameworks play an important role in helping our security and software engineers maintain and improve the security of our codebases while maintaining developer speed.\nBut implementing these frameworks comes with practical challenges, like design tradeoffs. Building a secure framework on top of Android APIs, for example, requires a thoughtful balance between security, usability, and maintainability.\nWith the emergence of AI-driven tools and automation we can scale the adoption of these frameworks across Meta’s large codebase. AI can assist in identifying insecure usage patterns, suggesting or automatically applying secure framework replacements and continuously monitoring compliance. This not only accelerates migration but also ensures consistent security enforcement at scale.\nTogether, these strategies empower our development teams to ship well-secured software efficiently, safeguarding user data and trust while maintaining high developer productivity across Meta’s vast ecosystem.\nHow We Design Secure-by-Default Frameworks at Meta\nDesigning secure-by-default frameworks for use by a large number of developers shipping vastly different features across multiple apps is an interesting challenge. There are a lot of competing concerns such as discoverability, usability, maintainability, performance, and security benefits. \nPractically speaking, developers only have a finite amount of time to code each day. The goal of our frameworks is to improve product security while being largely invisible and friction-free to avoid slowing developers down unnecessarily. This means that we have to correctly balance all those competing concerns discussed above. If we strike the wrong balance, some developers could avoid using our frameworks, which could reduce our ability to prevent security vulnerabilities. \nFor example, if we design a framework that improves product security in one area but introduces three new concepts and requires developers to provide five additional pieces of information per call site, some app developers may try to find a way around using them. Conversely, if we provide these same frameworks that are trivially easy to use, but they consume noticeable amounts of CPU and RAM, some app developers may, again, seek ways around using them, albeit for different reasons.\nThese examples might seem a bit obvious, but they are taken from real experiences over the last 10+ years developing ~15 secure-by-default frameworks targeting Android and iOS. Over that time, we’ve established some best practices for designing and implementing these new frameworks.\nTo the maximum extent possible, an effective framework should embody the following principles: \nThe secure framework API should resemble the existing API. This reduces the cognitive burden on framework users, forces security framework developers to minimize the complexity of the changes, and makes it easier to perform automated code conversion from the insecure to secure API usage.\nThe framework should itself be built on public and stable APIs. APIs from OS vendors and third parties change all the time, especially the non-public ones. Even if access to those APIs is technically allowed in some cases, building on top of private APIs is a recipe for constant fire drills (best case) and dead-end investment in frameworks that simply can’t work with newer versions of operating systems and libraries (worst case).\nThe framework should cover the maximum number of application users, not security use cases. There shouldn’t be one security framework that covers all security issues, and not every security issue is general enough to deserve its own framework. However, each security framework should be usable across all apps and OS versions for a particular platform. Small libraries are faster to build and deploy, and easier to maintain and explain to app developers.\nNow that we’ve looked at the design philosophy behind our frameworks, let’s look at one of our most widely used Android security frameworks, SecureLinkLauncher.\nSecureLinkLauncher: Preventing Android Intent Hijacking\nSecureLinkLauncher (SLL) is one of our widely-used secure frameworks. SLL is designed to prevent sensitive data from spilling through the Android intents system. It exemplifies our approach to secure-by-default frameworks by wrapping native Android intent launching methods with scope verification and security checks, preventing common vulnerabilities such as intent hijacking without sacrificing developer velocity or familiarity.\nThe system consists of intent senders and intent receivers. SLL is targeted to intent senders.\nSLL offers a semantic API that closely mirrors the familiar Android Context API for launching intents, including methods like startActivity() and startActivityForResult(). Instead of invoking the potentially insecure Android API directly, such as context.startActivity(intent);, developers use SecureLinkLauncher with a similar method call pattern, for example, SecureLinkLauncher.launchInternalActivity(intent, context);. Internally, SecureLinkLauncher delegates to the stable Android startActivity() API, ensuring that all intent launches are securely verified and protected by the framework.\npublic void launchInternalActivity(Intent intent, Context context) {\r\n   // Verify that the target activity is internal (same package)\r\n   if (!isInternalActivity(intent, context)) {\r\n       throw new SecurityException(\"Target activity is not internal\");\r\n   }\r\n   // Delegate to Android's startActivity to launch the intent\r\n   context.startActivity(intent);\r\n}\r\n\nSimilarly, instead of calling context.startActivityForResult(intent, code); directly, developers use SecureLinkLauncher.launchInternalActivityForResult(intent, code, context);. SecureLinkLauncher (SLL) wraps Android’s startActivity() and related methods, enforcing scope verification before delegating to the native Android API. This approach provides security by default while preserving the familiar Android intent launching semantics.\nOne of the most common ways that data is spilled through intents is due to incorrect targeting of the intent. As an example, following intent isn’t targeting a specific package. This means it can be received by any app with a matching <intent-filter>. While the intention of the developer might be that their Intent ends up in the Facebook app based on the URL, the reality is that any app, including a malicious application, could add an <intent-filter> that handles that URL and receive the intent. \nIntent intent = new Intent(FBLinks.PREFIX + \"profile\");\r\nintent.setExtra(SECRET_INFO, user_id);\r\nstartActivity(intent); \r\n// startActivity can’t ensure who the receiver of the intent would be\nIn the example below, SLL ensures that the intent is directed to one of the family apps, as specified by the developer’s scope for implicit intents. Without SLL, these intents can resolve to both family and non-family apps,potentially exposing SECRET_INFO to third-party or malicious apps on the user’s device. By enforcing this scope, SLL can prevent such information leaks.\nSecureLinkLauncher.launchFamilyActivity(intent, context); \r\n// launchFamilyActivity would make sure intent goes to the meta family apps\nIn a typical Android environment, two scopes – internal and external – might seem sufficient for handling intents within the same app and between different apps. However, Meta’s ecosystem is unique, comprising multiple apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and their variants (e.g., WhatsApp Business). The complexity of inter-process communication between these apps demands more nuanced control over intent scoping. To address this need, SLL provides a more fine-grained approach to intent scoping, offering scopes that cater to specific use cases:\nFamily scope: Enables secure communication between Meta-owned apps, ensuring that intents are only sent from one Meta app to another.\nSame-key scope: Restricts intent sending to Meta apps signed with the same key (not all Meta apps are signed by the same key), providing an additional layer of security and trust.\nInternal scope: Restricts intent sending within the app itself.\nThird-party scope: Allows intents to be sent to third-party apps, while preventing them from being handled by Meta’s own apps.\nBy leveraging these scopes, developers can ensure that sensitive data is shared securely and intentionally within the Meta ecosystem, while also protecting against unintended or malicious access. SLL’s fine-grained intent scoping capabilities, which are built upon the secure-by-default framework principles discussed above, empower developers to build more robust and secure applications that meet the unique demands of Meta’s complex ecosystem.\nLeveraging Generative AI To Deploy Secure-by-Default Frameworks at Scale\nAdopting these frameworks in a large codebase is non-trivial. The main complexity is choosing the correct scope, as that choice relies on information that is not readily available at existing call sites. While one could imagine a deterministic analysis attempting to infer the scope based on dataflows, that would be a large undertaking. Furthermore, it would likely have some precision-scalability trade-off. \nInstead, we explored using Generative AI for this case. AI can read the surrounding code and attempt to infer the scope based on variable names and comments surrounding the call site. While this approach isn’t always perfect, it doesn’t need to be. It just needs to provide good enough guesses, such that code owners can one-click accept suggested patches. \nIf the patches are correct in most cases, this is a big timesaver that enables efficient adoption of the framework. This complements our recent work on AutoPatchBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate AI-powered patch generators that leverage large language models (LLMs) to automatically recommend and apply security patches. Secure-by-default frameworks are a great example of the kinds of code modifications that an automatic patching system can apply to improve the security of a code base.\nWe’ve built a framework leveraging Llama as the core technology, which takes locations in the codebase that we want to migrate and suggests patches for code owners to accept:\n\nPrompt Creation\nThe AI workflow starts with a call site we want to migrate including its file path and line number. The location is used to extract a code snippet from the code base. This means opening the file where the call site is present, copying 10-20 lines before and after the call site location, and pasting this into the prompt template that gives general instructions as to how to perform the migration. This description is very similar to what would be written as an onboarding guide to the framework for human engineers.\nGenerative AI\nThe prompt is then provided to a Llama model (llama4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct). The model is asked to output two things: the modified code snippet, where the call site has been migrated; and, optionally, some actions (like adding an import to the top of a file). The main purpose of actions is to work around the limitations of this approach where all code changes are not local and limited to the code snippet. Actions enable the model fix to reach outside the snippet for some limited, deterministic changes. This is useful for adding imports or dependencies, which are rarely local to the code snippet, but are necessary for the code to compile. The code snippet is then inserted back to the code base and any actions are applied. \nValidation\nFinally, we perform a series of validations on the code base. We run all of these with and without the AI changes and only report the difference:\nLints: We run the linters again to confirm the lint issue was fixed and no new lint errors were introduced by the changes.\nCompiling: We compile and run tests covering the targeted file. This is not intended to catch all bugs (we rely on continuous integration for that), but give the AI some early feedback on its changes (such as compile errors). \nFormatting: The code is formatted to avoid formatting issues. We do not feed the formatting errors back to the AI.\nIf any errors arise during the validation, their error messages are included in the prompt (along with the “fixed” code snippet) and the AI is asked to try again. We repeat this loop five times and give up if no successful fix is created. If the validation succeeds, we submit a patch for human review.\nThoughtful Framework Design Meets Intelligent Automation\nBy adhering to core design principles such as providing an API that closely resembles existing OS patterns, relying solely on public and stable OS APIs, and designing frameworks that cover broad user bases rather than niche use cases, developers can create robust, secure-by-default features that integrate seamlessly into existing codebases.\n\nThese same design principles help us leverage AI for smoothly adopting frameworks at scale. While there are still challenges around the accuracy of generated code – for example, the AI choosing the incorrect scope, using incorrect syntax, etc., the internal feedback loop design allows the LLM to automatically move past easily solvable problems without human intervention, increasing scalability and reducing developer frustration.\nInternally, this project helped prove that AI could be impactful for adopting security frameworks across a diverse codebase in a way that is minimally disruptive to our developers. There are now a variety of projects tackling similar problems across a variety of codebases and languages – including C/++ – using diverse models and validation techniques. We expect this trend to continue and accelerate in 2026 as developers become more comfortable with state of the art AI tools and the quality of code that they are capable of producing.\nAs our codebase grows and security threats become more sophisticated, the combination of thoughtful framework design and intelligent automation will be essential to protecting user data and maintaining trust at scale.\nThe post How AI Is Transforming the Adoption of Secure-by-Default Mobile Frameworks appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By Jacob Meyers and Rob Zienert\nTemporal is a Durable Execution platform which allows you to write code “as if failures don’t exist”. It’s become increasingly critical to Netflix since its initial adoption in 2021, with users ranging from the operators of our Open Connect global CDN to our Live reliability teams now depending on Temporal to operate their business-critical services. In this post, I’ll give a high-level overview of what Temporal offers users, the problems we were experiencing operating Spinnaker that motivated its initial adoption at Netflix, and how Temporal helped us reduce the number of transient deployment failures at Netflix from 4% to 0.0001%.\nA Crash Course on (some of) Spinnaker\nSpinnaker is a multi-cloud continuous delivery platform that powers the vast majority of Netflix’s software deployments. It’s composed of several (mostly nautical themed) microservices. Let’s double-click on two in particular to understand the problems we were facing that led us to adopting Temporal.\nIn case you’re completely new to Spinnaker, Spinnaker’s fundamental tool for deployments is the Pipeline. A Pipeline is composed of a sequence of steps called Stages, which themselves can be decomposed into one or more Tasks, or other Stages. An example deployment pipeline for a production service may consist of these stages: Find Image -> Run Smoke Tests -> Run Canary -> Deploy to us-east-2 -> Wait -> Deploy to us-east-1.\nAn example Spinnaker Pipeline for a Netflix service\nPipeline configuration is extremely flexible. You can have Stages run completely serially, one after another, or you can have a mix of concurrent and serial Stages. Stages can also be executed conditionally based on the result of previous stages. This brings us to our first Spinnaker service: Orca. Orca is the orca-stration engine of Spinnaker. It’s responsible for managing the execution of the Stages and Tasks that a Pipeline unrolls into and coordinating with other Spinnaker services to actually execute them.\nOne of those collaborating services is called Clouddriver. In the example Pipeline above, some of the Stages will require interfacing with cloud infrastructure. For example, the canary deployment involves creating ephemeral hosts to run an experiment, and a full deployment of a new version of the service may involve spinning up new servers and then tearing down the old ones. We call these sorts of operations that mutate cloud infrastructure Cloud Operations. Clouddriver’s job is to decompose and execute Cloud Operations sent to it by Orca as part of a deployment. Cloud Operations sent from Orca to Clouddriver are relatively high level (for example: createServerGroup), so Clouddriver understands how to translate these into lower-level cloud provider API calls.\nPain points in the interaction between Orca and Clouddriver and the implementation details of Cloud Operation execution in Clouddriver are what led us to look for new solutions and ultimately migrate to Temporal, so we’ll next look at the anatomy of a Cloud Operation. Cloud Operations in the OSS version of Spinnaker still work as described below, so motivated readers can follow along in source code, however our migration to Temporal is entirely closed-source following a fork from OSS in 2020 to allow Netflix to make larger pivots to the product such as this one.\nThe Original Cloud Operation Flow\nA Cloud Operation’s execution goes something like this:\n\nOrca, in orchestrating a Pipeline execution, decides a particular Cloud Operation needs to be performed. It sends a POST request to Clouddriver’s /ops endpoint with an untyped bag-of-fields.\nClouddriver attempts to resolve the operation Orca sent into a set of AtomicOperation s— internal operations that only Clouddriver understands.\nIf the payload was valid and Clouddriver successfully resolved the operation, it will immediately return a Task ID to Orca.\nOrca will immediately begin polling Clouddriver’s GET /task/<id> endpoint to keep track of the status of the Cloud Operation.\nAsynchronously, Clouddriver begins executing AtomicOperations using its own internal orchestration engine. Ultimately, the AtomicOperations resolve into cloud provider API calls. As the Cloud Operation progresses, Clouddriver updates an internal state store to surface progress to Orca.\nEventually, if all went well, Clouddriver will mark the Cloud Operation complete, which eventually surfaces to Orca in its polling. Orca considers the Cloud Operation finished, and the deployment can progress.\nA sequence diagram of a Cloud Operation execution\nThis works well enough on the happy path, but veer off the happy path and dragons begin to emerge:\n\nClouddriver has its own internal orchestration system independent of Orca to allow Orca to query the progress of Cloud Operation. This is largely undifferentiated lifting relative to Clouddriver’s goal of actuating cloud infrastructure changes, and ultimately adds complexity and surface area for bugs to the application. Additionally, Orca is tightly coupled to Clouddriver’s orchestration system — it must understand how to poll Clouddriver, interpret the status, and handle errors returned by Clouddriver.\nDistributed systems are messy — networks and external services are unreliable. While executing a Cloud Operation, Clouddriver could experience transient network issues, or the cloud provider it’s attempting to call into may be having an outage, or any number of issues in between. Despite all of this, Clouddriver must be as reliable as reasonably possible as a core platform service. To deal with this shape of issue, Clouddriver internally evolved complex retry logic, further adding cognitive complexity to the system.\nRemember how a Cloud Operation gets decomposed by Clouddriver into AtomicOperations? Sometimes, if there’s a failure in the middle of a Cloud Operation, we need to be able to roll back what was done in AtomicOperations prior to the failure. This led to a homegrown Saga framework being implemented inside Clouddriver. While this did result in a big step forward in reliability of Cloud Operations facing transient failures because the Saga framework also allowed replaying partially-failed Cloud Operations, it added yet more undifferentiated lifting inside the service.\nThe task state kept by Clouddriver was instance-local. In other words, if the Clouddriver instance carrying out a Cloud Operation crashed, that Cloud Operation state was lost, and Orca would eventually time out polling for the task status. The Saga implementation mentioned above mitigated this for certain operations, but was not widely adopted across all cloud providers supported by Spinnaker.\n\nWe introduced a lot of incidental complexity into Clouddriver in an effort to keep Cloud Operation execution reliable, and despite all this deployments still failed around 4% of the time due to transient Cloud Operation failures.\nNow, I can already hear you saying: “So what? Can’t people re-try their deployments if they fail?” While true, some pipelines take days to complete for complex deployments, and a failed Cloud Operation mid-way through requires re-running the whole thing. This was detrimental to engineering productivity at Netflix in a non-trivial way. Rather than continue trying to build a faster horse, we began to look elsewhere for our reliable orchestration requirements, which is where Temporal comes in.\nTemporal: Basic Concepts\nTemporal is an open source product that offers a durable execution platform for your applications. Durable execution means that the platform will ensure your programs run to completion despite adverse conditions. With Temporal, you organize your business logic into Workflows, which are a deterministic series of steps. The steps inside of Workflows are called Activities, which is where you encapsulate all your non-deterministic logic that needs to happen in the course of executing your Workflows. As your Workflows execute in processes called Workers, the Temporal server durably stores their execution state so that in the event of failures your Workflows can be retried or even migrated to a different Worker. This makes Workflows incredibly resilient to the sorts of transient failures Clouddriver was susceptible to. Here’s a simple example Workflow in Java that runs an Activity to send an email once every 30 days:\n@WorkflowInterface\npublic interface SleepForDaysWorkflow {\n    @WorkflowMethod\n    void run();\n}\npublic class SleepForDaysWorkflowImpl implements SleepForDaysWorkflow {\n    private final SendEmailActivities emailActivities =\n            Workflow.newActivityStub(\n                    SendEmailActivities.class,\n                    ActivityOptions.newBuilder()\n                            .setStartToCloseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))\n                            .build());\n    @Override\n    public void run() {\n        while (true) {\n            // Activities already carry retries/timeouts via options.\n            emailActivities.sendEmail();\n            // Pause the workflow for 30 days before sending the next email.\n            Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofDays(30));\n        }\n    }\n}\n@ActivityInterface\npublic interface SendEmailActivities {\n    void sendEmail();\n}\nThere’s some interesting things to note about this Workflow:\n\nWorkflows and Activities are just code, so you can test them using the same techniques and processes as the rest of your codebase.\nActivities are automatically retried by Temporal with configurable exponential backoff.\nTemporal manages all the execution state of the Workflow, including timers (like the one used by Workflow.sleep). If the Worker executing this workflow were to have its power cable unplugged, Temporal would ensure another Worker continues to execute it (even during the 30 day sleep).\nWorkflow sleeps are not compute-intensive, and they don’t tie up the process.\n\nYou might already begin to see how Temporal solves a lot of the problems we had with Clouddriver. Ultimately, we decided to pull the trigger on migrating Cloud Operation execution to Temporal.\nCloud Operations with Temporal\nToday, we execute Cloud Operations as Temporal workflows. Here’s what that looks like.\n\nOrca, using a Temporal client, sends a request to Temporal to execute an UntypedCloudOperationRunner Workflow. The contract of the Workflow looks something like this:\n\n@WorkflowInterface\ninterface UntypedCloudOperationRunner {\n  /**\n   * Runs a cloud operation given an untyped payload.\n   *\n   * WorkflowResult is a thin wrapper around OutputType providing a standard contract for\n   * clients to determine if the CloudOperation was successful and fetching any errors.\n   */\n  @WorkflowMethod\n  fun <OutputType : CloudOperationOutput> run(stageContext: Map<String, Any?>, operationType: String): WorkflowResult<OutputType>\n}\n2. The Clouddriver Temporal worker is constantly polling Temporal for work. A worker will eventually see a task for an UntypedCloudOperationRunner Workflow and start executing it.\n3. Similar to before with resolution into AtomicOperations, Clouddriver does some pre-processing of the bag-of-fields in stageContext and resolves it to a strongly typed implementation of the CloudOperation Workflow interface based on the operationType input and the stageContext:\ninterface CloudOperation<I : CloudOperationInput, O : CloudOperationOutput> {\n  @WorkflowMethod\n  fun operate(input: I, credentials: AccountCredentials<out Any>): O\n}\n4. Clouddriver starts a Child Workflow execution of the CloudOperation implementation it resolved. The child workflow will execute Activities which handle the actual cloud provider API calls to mutate infrastructure.\n5. Orca uses its Temporal Client to await completion of the UntypedCloudOperationRunner Workflow. Once it’s complete, Temporal notifies the client and sends the result and Orca can continue progressing the deployment.\nSequence diagram of a Cloud Operation execution with Temporal\nResults and Lessons Learned from the Migration\nA shiny new architecture is great, but equally important is the non-glamorous work of refactoring legacy systems to fit the new architecture. How did we integrate Temporal into critical dependencies of all Netflix engineers transparently?\nThe answer, of course, is a combination of abstraction and dynamic configuration. We built a CloudOperationRunner interface in Orca to encapsulate whether the Cloud Operation was being executed via the legacy path or Temporal. At runtime, Fast Properties (Netflix’s dynamic configuration system) determined which path a stage that needed to execute a Cloud Operation would take. We could set these properties quite granularly — by Stage type, cloud provider account, Spinnaker application, Cloud Operation type (createServerGroup), and cloud provider (either AWS or Titus in our case). The Spinnaker services themselves were the first to be deployed using Temporal, and within two quarters, all applications at Netflix were onboarded.\nImpact\nWhat did we have to show for it all? With Temporal as the orchestration engine for Cloud Operations, the percentage of deployments that failed due to transient Cloud Operation failures dropped from 4% to 0.0001%. For those keeping track at home, that’s a four and a half order of magnitude reduction. Virtually eliminating this failure mode for deployments was a huge win for developer productivity, especially for teams with long and complex deployment pipelines.\nBeyond the improvement in deployment success metrics, we saw a number of other benefits:\n\nOrca no longer needs to directly communicate with Clouddriver to start Cloud Operations or poll their status with Temporal as the intermediary. The services are less coupled, which is a win for maintainability.\nSpeaking of maintainability, with Temporal doing the heavy lifting of orchestration and retries inside of Clouddriver, we got to remove a lot of the homegrown logic we’d built up over the years for the same purpose.\nSince Temporal manages execution state, Clouddriver instances became stateless and Cloud Operation execution can bounce between instances with impunity. We can treat Clouddriver instances more like cattle and enable things like Chaos Monkey for the service which we were previously prevented from doing.\nMigrating Cloud Operation steps into Activities was a forcing function to re-write the logic to be idempotent. Since Temporal retries activities by default, it’s generally recommended they be idempotent. This alone fixed a number of issues that existed previously when operations were retried in Clouddriver.\nWe set the retry timeout for Activities in Clouddriver to be two hours by default. This gives us a long leash to fix-forward or rollback Clouddriver if we introduce a regression before customer deployments fail — to them, it might just look like a deployment is taking longer than usual.\nCloud Operations are much easier to introspect than before. Temporal ships with a great UI to help visualize Workflow and Activity executions, which is a huge boon for debugging live Workflows executing in production. The Temporal SDKs and server also emit a lot of useful metrics.\nExecution of a resizeServerGroup Cloud Operation as seen from the Temporal UI. This operation executes 3 Activities: DescribeAutoScalingGroup, GetHookConfigurations, and ResizeServerGroup\nLessons Learned\nWith the benefit of hindsight, there are also some lessons we can share from this migration:\n1. Avoid unnecessary Child Workflows: Structuring Cloud Operations as an UntypedCloudOperationRunner Workflow that starts Child Workflows to actually execute the Cloud Operation’s logic was unnecessary and the indirection made troubleshooting more difficult. There are situations where Child Workflows are appropriate, but in this case we were using them as a tool for code organization, which is generally unnecessary. We could’ve achieved the same effect with class composition in the top-level parent Workflow.\n2. Use single argument objects: At first, we structured Workflow and Activity functions with variable arguments, much as you’d write normal functions. This can be problematic for Temporal because of Temporal’s determinism constraints. Adding or removing an argument from a function signature is not a backward-compatible change, and doing so can break long-running workflows — and it’s not immediately obvious in code review your change is problematic. The preferred pattern is to use a single serializable class to host all your arguments for Workflows and Activities — these can be more freely changed without breaking determinism.\n3. Separate business failures from workflow failures: We like the pattern of the WorkflowResult type that UntypedCloudOperationRunner returns in the interface above. It allows us to communicate business process failures without failing the Workflow itself and have more overall nuance in error handling. This is a pattern we’ve carried over to other Workflows we’ve implemented since.\nTemporal at Netflix Today\nTemporal adoption has skyrocketed at Netflix since its initial introduction for Spinnaker. Today, we have hundreds of use cases, and we’ve seen adoption double in the last year with no signs of slowing down.\nOne major difference between initial adoption and today is that Netflix migrated from an on-prem Temporal deployment to using Temporal Cloud, which is Temporal’s SaaS offering of the Temporal server. This has let us scale Temporal adoption while running a lean team. We’ve also built up a robust internal platform around Temporal Cloud to integrate with Netflix’s internal ecosystem and make onboarding for our developers as easy as possible. Stay tuned for a future post digging into more specifics of our Netflix Temporal platform.\nAcknowledgement\nWe all stand on the shoulders of giants in software. I want to call out that I’m retelling the work of my two stunning colleagues Chris Smalley and Rob Zienert in this post, who were the two aforementioned engineers who introduced Temporal and carried out the migration.\n\nHow Temporal Powers Reliable Cloud Operations at Netflix was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Xiaomei Liu, Joseph Lynch, Chris Newton\nIntroduction\nBehind the Streams: Building a Reliable Cloud Live Streaming Pipeline for Netflix introduced the architecture of the streaming pipeline. This blog post looks at the custom Origin Server we built for Live — the Netflix Live Origin. It sits at the demarcation point between the cloud live streaming pipelines on its upstream side and the distribution system, Open Connect, Netflix’s in-house Content Delivery Network (CDN), on its downstream side, and acts as a broker managing what content makes it out to Open Connect and ultimately to the client devices.\nLive Streaming Distribution and Origin Architecture\nNetflix Live Origin is a multi-tenant microservice operating on EC2 instances within the AWS cloud. We lean on standard HTTP protocol features to communicate with the Live Origin. The Packager pushes segments to it using PUT requests, which place a file into storage at the particular location named in the URL. The storage location corresponds to the URL that is used when the Open Connect side issues the corresponding GET request.\nLive Origin architecture is influenced by key technical decisions of the live streaming architecture. First, resilience is achieved through redundant regional live streaming pipelines, with failover orchestrated at the server-side to reduce client complexity. The implementation of epoch locking at the cloud encoder enables the origin to select a segment from either encoding pipeline. Second, Netflix adopted a manifest design with segment templates and constant segment duration to avoid frequent manifest refresh. The constant duration templates enable Origin to predict the segment publishing schedule.\nMulti-pipeline and multi-region aware origin\nLive streams inevitably contain defects due to the non-deterministic nature of live contribution feeds and strict real-time segment publishing timelines. Common defects include:\n\nShort segments: Missing video frames and audio samples.\nMissing segments: Entire segments are absent.\nSegment timing discontinuity: Issues with the Track Fragment Decode Time.\n\nCommunicating segment discontinuity from the server to the client via a segment template-based manifest is impractical, and these defective segments can disrupt client streaming.\nThe redundant cloud streaming pipelines operate independently, encompassing distinct cloud regions, contribution feeds, encoder, and packager deployments. This independence substantially mitigates the probability of simultaneous defective segments across the dual pipelines. Owing to its strategic placement within the distribution path, the live origin naturally emerges as a component capable of intelligent candidate selection.\nThe Netflix Live Origin features multi-pipeline and multi-region awareness. When a segment is requested, the live origin checks candidates from each pipeline in a deterministic order, selecting the first valid one. Segment defects are detected via lightweight media inspection at the packager. This defect information is provided as metadata when the segment is published to the live origin. In the rare case of concurrent defects at the dual pipeline, the segment defects can be communicated downstream for intelligent client-side error concealment.\nOpen Connect streaming optimization\nWhen the Live project started, Open Connect had become highly optimised for VOD content delivery — nginx had been chosen many years ago as the Web Server since it is highly capable in this role, and a number of enhancements had been added to it and to the underlying operating system (BSD). Unlike traditional CDNs, Open Connect is more of a distributed origin server — VOD assets are pre-positioned onto carefully selected server machines (OCAs, or Open Connect Appliances) rather than being filled on demand.\nAlongside the VOD delivery, an on-demand fill system has been used for non-VOD assets — this includes artwork and the downloadable portions of the clients, etc. These are also served out of the same nginx workers, albeit under a distinct server block, using a distinct set of hostnames.\nLive didn’t fit neatly into this ‘small object delivery’ model, so we extended the proxy-caching functionality of nginx to address Live-specific needs. We will touch on some of these here related to optimized interactions with the Origin Server. Look for a future blog post that will go into more details on the Open Connect side.\nThe segment templates provided to clients are also provided to the OCAs as part of the Live Event Configuration data. Using the Availability Start Time and Initial Segment number, the OCA is able to determine the legitimate range of segments for each event at any point in time — requests for objects outside this range can be rejected, preventing unnecessary requests going up through the fill hierarchy to the origin. If a request makes it through to the origin, and the segment isn’t available yet, the origin server will return a 404 Status Code (indicating File Not Found) with the expiration policy of that error so that it can be cached within Open Connect until just before that segment is expected to be published.\nIf the Live Origin knows when segments are being pushed to it, and knows what the live edge is — when a request is received for the immediately next object, rather than handing back another 404 error (which would go all the way back through Open Connect to the client), the Live Origin can ‘hold open’ the request, and service it once the segment has been published to it. By doing this, the degree of chatter within the network handling requests that arrive early has been significantly reduced. As part of this, millisecond grain caching was added to nginx to enhance the standard HTTP Cache Control, which only works at second granularity, a long time when segments are generated every 2 seconds.\nStreaming metadata enhancement\nThe HTTP standard allows for the addition of request and response headers that can be used to provide additional information as files move between clients and servers. The HTTP headers provide notifications of events within the stream in a highly scalable way that is independently conveyed to client devices, regardless of their playback position within the stream.\nThese notifications are provided to the origin by the live streaming pipeline and are inserted by the origin in the form of headers, appearing on the segments generated at that point in time (and persist to future segments — they are cumulative). Whenever a segment is received at an OCA, this notification information is extracted from the response headers and used to update an in-memory data structure, keyed by event ID; and whenever a segment is served from the OCA, the latest such notification data is attached to the response. This means that, given any flow of segments into an OCA, it will always have the most recent notification data, even if all clients requesting it are behind the live edge. In fact, the notification information can be conveyed on any response, not just those supplying new segments.\nCache invalidation and origin mask\nAn invalidation system has been available since the early days of the project. It can be used to “flush” all content associated with an event by altering the key used when looking up objects in cache — this is done by incorporating a version number into the cache key that can then be bumped on demand. This is used during pre-event testing so that the network can be returned to a pristine state for the test with minimal fuss.\nEach segment published by the Live Origin conveys the encoding pipeline it was generated by, as well as the region it was requested from. Any issues that are found after segments make their way into the network can be remedied by an enhanced invalidation system that takes such variants into account. It is possible to invalidate (that is, cause to be considered expired) segments in a range of segment numbers, but only if they were sourced from encoder A, or from Encoder A, but only if retrieved from region X.\nIn combination with Open Connect’s enhanced cache invalidation, the Netflix Live Origin allows selective encoding pipeline masking to exclude a range of segments from a particular pipeline when serving segments to Open Connect. The enhanced cache invalidation and origin masking enable live streaming operations to hide known problematic segments (e.g., segments causing client playback errors) from streaming clients once the bad segments are detected, protecting millions of streaming clients during the DVR playback window.\nOrigin storage architecture\nOur original storage architecture for the Live Origin was simple: just use AWS S3 like we do for SVOD. This served us well initially for our low-traffic events, but as we scaled up we discovered that Live streaming has unique latency and workload requirements that differ significantly from on-demand where we have significant time ahead-of-time to pre-position content. While S3 met its stated uptime guarantees, our strict 2-second retry budget inherent to Live events (where every write is critical) led us to explore optimizations specifically tailored for real-time delivery at scale. AWS S3 is an amazing object store, but our Live streaming requirements were closer to those of a global low-latency highly-available database. So, we went back to the drawing board and started from the requirements. The Origin required:\n\n[HA Writes] Extremely high write availability, ideally as close to full write availability within a single AWS region, with low second replication delay to other regions. Any failed write operation within 500ms is considered a bug that must be triaged and prevented from re-occurring.\n[Throughput] High write throughput, with hundreds of MiB replicating across regions\n[Large Partitions] Efficiently support O(MiB) writes that accumulate to O(10k) keys per partition with O(GiB) total size per event.\n[Strong Consistency] Within the same region, we needed read-your-write semantics to hit our <1s read delay requirements (must be able to read published segments)\n[Origin Storm] During worst-case load involving Open Connect edge cases, we may need to handle O(GiB) of read throughput without affecting writes.\n\nFortunately, Netflix had previously invested in building a KeyValue Storage Abstraction that cleverly leveraged Apache Cassandra to provide chunked storage of MiB or even GiB values. This abstraction was initially built to support cloud saves of Game state. The Live use case would push the boundaries of this solution, however, in terms of availability for writes (#1), cumulative partition size (#3), and read throughput during Origin Storm (#5).\nHigh Availability for Writes of Large Payloads\nThe KeyValue Payload Chunking and Compression Algorithm breaks O(MiB) work down so each part can be idempotently retried and hedged to maintain strict latency service level objectives, as well as spreading the data across the full cluster. When we combine this algorithm with Apache Cassandra’s local-quorum consistency model, which allows write availability even with an entire Availability Zone outage, plus a write-optimized Log-Structured Merge Tree (LSM) storage engine, we could meet the first four requirements. After iterating on the performance and availability of this solution, we were not only able to achieve the write availability required, but did so with a P99 tail latency that was similar to the status quo’s P50 average latency while also handling cross-region replication behind the scenes for the Origin. This new solution was significantly more expensive (as expected, databases backed by SSD cost more), but minimizing cost was not a key objective and low latency with high availability was:\nStorage System Write Performance\nHigh Availability Reads at Gbps Throughputs\nNow that we solved the write reliability problem, we had to handle the Origin Storm failure case, where potentially dozens of Open Connect top-tier caches could be requesting multiple O(MiB) video segments at once. Our back-of-the-envelope calculations showed worst-case read throughput in the O(100Gbps) range, which would normally be extremely expensive for a strongly-consistent storage engine like Apache Cassandra. With careful tuning of chunk access, we were able to respond to reads at network line rate (100Gbps) from Apache Cassandra, but we observed unacceptable performance and availability degradation on concurrent writes. To resolve this issue, we introduced write-through caching of chunks using our distributed caching system EVCache, which is based on Memcached. This allows almost all reads to be served from a highly scalable cache, allowing us to easily hit 200Gbps and beyond without affecting the write path, achieving read-write separation.\nFinal Storage Architecture\nIn the final storage architecture, the Live Origin writes and reads to KeyValue, which manages a write-through cache to EVCache (memcached) and implements a safe chunking protocol that spreads large values and partitions them out across the storage cluster (Apache Cassandra). This allows almost all read load to be handled from cache, with only misses hitting the storage. This combination of cache and highly available storage has met the demanding needs of our Live Origin for over a year now.\nStorage System High Level Architecture\nDelivering this consistent low latency for large writes with cross-region replication and consistent write-through caching to a distributed cache required solving numerous hard problems with novel techniques, which we plan to share in detail during a future post.\nScalability and scalable architecture\nNetflix’s live streaming platform must handle a high volume of diverse stream renditions for each live event. This complexity stems from supporting various video encoding formats (each with multiple encoder ladders), numerous audio options (across languages, formats, and bitrates), and different content versions (e.g., with or without advertisements). The combination of these elements, alongside concurrent event support, leads to a significant number of unique stream renditions per live event. This, in turn, necessitates a high Requests Per Second (RPS) capacity from the multi-tenant live origin service to ensure publishing-side scalability.\nIn addition, Netflix’s global reach presents distinct challenges to the live origin on the retrieval side. During the Tyson vs. Paul fight event in 2024, a historic peak of 65 million concurrent streams was observed. Consequently, a scalable architecture for live origin is essential for the success of large-scale live streaming.\nScaling architecture\nWe chose to build a highly scalable origin instead of relying on the traditional origin shields approach for better end-to-end cache consistency control and simpler system architecture. The live origin in this architecture directly connects with top-tier Open Connect nodes, which are geographically distributed across several sites. To minimize the load on the origin, only designated nodes per stream rendition at each site are permitted to directly fill from the origin.\nNetflix Live Origin Scalability Architecture\nWhile the origin service can autoscale horizontally using EC2 instances, there are other system resources that are not autoscalable, such as storage platform capacity and AWS to Open Connect backbone bandwidth capacity. Since in live streaming, not all requests to the live origin are of the same importance, the origin is designed to prioritize more critical requests over less critical requests when system resources are limited. The table below outlines the request categories, their identification, and protection methods.\n\nPublishing isolation\nPublishing traffic, unlike potentially surging CDN retrieval traffic, is predictable, making path isolation a highly effective solution. As shown in the scalability architecture diagram, the origin utilizes separate EC2 publishing and CDN stacks to protect the latency and failure-sensitive origin writes. In addition, the storage abstraction layer features distinct clusters for key-value (KV) read and KV write operations. Finally, the storage layer itself separates read (EVCache) and write (Cassandra) paths. This comprehensive path isolation facilitates independent cloud scaling of publishing and retrieval, and also prevents CDN-facing traffic surges from impacting the performance and reliability of origin publishing.\nPriority rate limiting\nGiven Netflix’s scale, managing incoming requests during a traffic storm is challenging, especially considering non-autoscalable system resources. The Netflix Live Origin implemented priority-based rate limiting when the underlying system is under stress. This approach ensures that requests with greater user impact are prioritized to succeed, while requests with lower user impact are allowed to fail during times of stress in order to protect the streaming infrastructure and are permitted to retry later to succeed.\nLeveraging Netflix’s microservice platform priority rate limiting feature, the origin prioritizes live edge traffic over DVR traffic during periods of high load on the storage platform. The live edge vs. DVR traffic detection is based on the predictable segment template. The template is further cached in memory on the origin node to enable priority rate limiting without access to the datastore, which is valuable especially during periods of high datastore stress.\nTo mitigate traffic surges, TTL cache control is used alongside priority rate limiting. When the low-priority traffic is impacted, the origin instructs Open Connect to slow down and cache identical requests for 5 seconds by setting a max-age = 5s and returns an HTTP 503 error code. This strategy effectively dampens traffic surges by preventing repeated requests to the origin within that 5-second window.\nThe following diagrams illustrate origin priority rate limiting with simulated traffic. The nliveorigin_mp41 traffic is the low-priority traffic and is mixed with other high-priority traffic. In the first row: the 1st diagram shows the request RPS, the 2nd diagram shows the percentage of request failure. In the second row, the 1st diagram shows datastore resource utilization, and the 2nd diagram shows the origin retrieval P99 latency. The results clearly show that only the low-priority traffic (nliveorigin_mp41) is impacted at datastore high utilization, and the origin request latency is under control.\nOrigin Priority Rate Limiting\n404 storm and cache optimization\nPublishing isolation and priority rate limiting successfully protect the live origin from DVR traffic storms. However, the traffic storm generated by requests for non-existent segments presents further challenges and opportunities for optimization.\nThe live origin structures metadata hierarchically as event > stream rendition > segment, and the segment publishing template is maintained at the stream rendition level. This hierarchical organization allows the origin to preemptively reject requests with an HTTP 404(not found)/410(Gone) error, leveraging highly cacheable event and stream rendition level metadata, avoiding unnecessary queries to the segment level metadata:\n\nIf the event is unknown, reject the request with 404\nIf the event is known, but the segment request timing does not match the expected publishing timing, reject the request with 404 and cache control TTL matching the expected publishing time\nIf the event is known, the requested segment is never generated or misses the retry deadline, reject the request with a 410 error, preventing the client from repeatedly requesting\n\nAt the storage layer, metadata is stored separately from media data in the control plane datastore. Unlike the media datastore, the control plane datastore does not use a distributed cache to avoid cache inconsistency. Event and rendition level metadata benefits from a high cache hit ratio when in-memory caching is utilized at the live origin instance. During traffic storms involving non-existent segments, the cache hit ratio for control plane access easily exceeds 90%.\nThe use of in-memory caching for metadata effectively handles 404 storms at the live origin without causing datastore stress. This metadata caching complements the storage system’s distributed media cache, providing a complete solution for traffic surge protection.\nSummary\nThe Netflix Live Origin, built upon an optimized storage platform, is specifically designed for live streaming. It incorporates advanced media and segment publishing scheduling awareness and leverages enhanced intelligence to improve streaming quality, optimize scalability, and improve Open Connect live streaming operations.\nAcknowledgement\nMany teams and stunning colleagues contributed to the Netflix live origin.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI is more like a megaphone than a magic wand. It amplifies what is already there. Whatever habits you bring to your workflow, good or bad, AI will turn up the volume. \nEvery untested component, undocumented design, and ill-specified feature, to name a few, becomes louder when AI enters the mix.\nTeams with a clear intent about what they are building upfront, with the right best practices in place to preserve that intent, will find leverage with AI. But for those who rely on improvisation or unspoken rules, confusion multiplies. \nThe data tells the same story. A 2025 study by MIT and the U.S. Census Bureau found that firms with disciplined management practices mitigated short-term decline and boosted long-term returns when adopting AI.\nThis is how AI mirrors habits, not intentions, and reflects the culture that creates it.\nCulture in, culture out\nAI learns from what surrounds it. The more structure and clarity you give AI, the less noise you’ll get back. It’s not simply a garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO) problem. \nEven a well-written PRD can still lead to faulty code, which is why you need downstream safeguards like reliable unit tests to preserve the intent of the original input.\nThis helps explain why inaccuracy emerged as one of the top two risks for organizations in McKinsey’s 2025 global survey on the state of AI.\nThink of AI like an intern who learns by imitation and is guardrailed by good practices. When your codebase is well-patterned, commit messages are readable, and architectural intent is documented, AI can better navigate and contribute to your codebase intelligently. Without this structure, AI tools are left to guess intent and design, and are likely to leave a mess.\nDiscipline as leverage\nDiscipline is not optional in the age of AI. Setting and conforming to standards, and documenting decisions aren’t bureaucratic chores. They’re the signals AI uses to understand your world. They turn your practices into a map that both humans and machines can follow.\nIf your team already values practices like clean code, test-driven development (TDD), good documentation, and legible code reviews, AI will amplify these good habits by handling repetitive tasks following these good habits. \nThe aforementioned McKinsey study on the state of AI confirmed this: organizations with the highest returns from AI followed a range of best practices. However, without structure and processes, AI magnifies weakness, spreading it across every line of code.\nDiscipline doesn’t have to slow you down. There is a durable saying that can be applied here: go slow to go fast.\nSystems that scale\nAI extends your existing system. Continuous integration, automated checks, and code reviews create the safety nets that make scaling possible. When these systems are strong, AI integrates into them seamlessly. \nBut when those systems are missing, AI doesn’t fix the gap. It introduces errors faster than your feedback loops can correct them.\nLook at AI like a high-performance engine. It makes your car faster. But if you fail to tune your brakes and steering, you’ll just crash sooner. The 2025 State of AI Code Quality report by Qodo validates this, as teams using AI for code review saw quality improvements surge to 81%, compared to 55% for those without review.\nAI scales whatever exists. The question is whether what exists deserves scaling.\nDesign for delegation\nDelegating to AI without design is guesswork. You wouldn’t hand off a feature to a new developer without explaining its scope, dependencies, and success criteria. \nThe same logic applies to AI. When you define tasks precisely, AI amplifies precision. When you delegate vaguely, AI amplifies confusion.\nBreak tasks into clear, verifiable steps. Define what “good enough” looks like. Specify what the model should handle and where human judgment still matters. \nYour ability to define boundaries becomes the control knob for how AI reflects your team’s habits. The more intentional your delegation, the more reliable your automation.\nAs the technology evolves, those boundaries will shift. But clarity multiplies efficiency.\nWhat the mirror reveals\nAI is not a fixer of culture. It’s not a patch for weak processes or an escape hatch from discipline. It’s a mirror that reflects your practices in high definition. It will take whatever you already do and turn the volume up. \nIf your workflows are healthy, AI will reinforce that health. If your culture cuts corners, AI will cut them faster.\nThe promise of AI isn’t that it will make bad teams good. It’s that it will long-lever already good teams with good habits. Every improvement in your engineering culture makes your AI more effective. Every bad habit you ignore becomes louder.\nSo, before asking what AI can do for you, ask what your habits will cause it to spotlight next. AI doesn’t change who you are. It just amplifies what’s already there.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "MPS 2025.3 introduces a major overhaul of the JavaDoc language, significant changes to generator plans, and a major update to the reflective editor. It also enables keyboard actions in the Logical view and allows TextIcon to offer visually distinct variants for light and dark themes.\nDOWNLOAD MPS 2025.3\nWhat’s new\nCheck out all the available updates.\nJavaDoc language overhaul\nThe JavaDoc language has been completely migrated to use the jetbrains.mps.lang.text language for text representation and editing. This change is expected to have minimal impact on the overall user experience. However, it fixes numerous problems:\nThe editing experience is now consistent with other MPS languages that use jetbrains.mps.lang.text, such as BaseLanguage comments or structure language documentation. For more information on editing text, refer to the documentation facet page.\nText can be copied and pasted between JavaDoc, BaseLanguage comments, language documentation comments, and other places where jetbrains.mps.lang.text is used. You can also copy and paste plain text.\nText can now include styling, such as bold or italics. This styling is generated as HTML tags in the resulting Java source files.\nAlong the way, several problems associated with the JavaDoc language have been resolved:\nThe description for block tags was changed to use jetbrains.mps.lang.text instead of string properties, so the same edit/copy/paste/style functionality is available inside block tags.\nBlock tags now support multiple lines of description.\nBoth block tags and inline tags are now correctly parsed from Java sources.\nA new {@literal …} inline tag was added as mandated by the Java language specification.\nCode inside CodeSnippet correctly resolves local variables.\nNodeWrapper correctly textgens the contained nodes.\n\nPaste as JavaDoc action available in BaseLanguage\nIn addition to the existing Paste as Java Statement and Paste as Class Content actions, the redesigned JavaDoc language supports a new action that enables easy pasting of textual JavaDoc code into BaseLanguage. Most importantly, this new action ensures that your JavaDoc code is properly parsed into JavaDoc text lines, block tags, and inline tags, including potential reference resolutions (e.g. for the @param or {@link } tags).\n\nThis new Paste as JavaDoc action parses the text from the clipboard and pastes it into a JavaDoc comment at the current position of the cursor. If the cursor is not positioned within an existing JavaDoc comment, the action attaches the parsed JavaDoc elements to the following field/method/class definition’s JavaDoc, creating a new JavaDoc file for them, if needed.\n\nContributions to generator plans\nWe’ve made some major improvements to generator plans, enhancing the user’s experience with complex model transformations. A new notion of PlanContribution supersedes and completely replaces the experimental fork as functionality that we introduced back in 2024.1.\ntargetFacet (see jetbrains.mps.generator.extensions.common model), which tells <mps.make> which GenerationTargetFacet/ModuleFacet to consult when determining an appropriate output location for a model.\n\nConditional forks with generator plans\nBoth the fork step and a PlanContribution in a generator plan support conditional activation. It’s now possible to activate certain branches of a plan only when certain criteria are met. At the moment, MPS comes with a conditional statement that checks the values of specified plan parameters. We intend to eventually extend statements to support logical operations (and/or), as well as other potential operations, while maintaining a strict interpretation of generator plans (i.e. no BaseLanguage code in plans).\nParameterDeclaration classes. Values for these parameters can be contributed using a PlanParameterContributor extension point. MPS comes with a few predefined parameters that are usable straight out of the box – see the jetbrains.mps.generator.extensions.common model for full details of these.\n\nLight and dark TextIcon options\nTextIcon’s layers can now be configured to apply to the Light, Dark, or both color themes. Additionally, the color literals in TextIcon’s definition can provide different values for the light and dark color themes.\n\nReflective editor overhaul\nThe reflective (default) editor has a new look and feel. The read-only default editor has been merged with the reflective editor, so there’s no longer confusion between the two.\n\nMore new features…\nCheck out the What’s New page to learn all about the new features.\nhere.\nTry the new features and let us know what you think.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Looking back\nHello, friends!\n10 years ago to this very day, DataGrip was born. That’s right, on December 16, 2016, the first-ever version of DataGrip was released! \n\n\n\n\nBut the origins of DataGrip go back even further. We had already been working to create a database IDE for quite some time by then, and its codename was 0xdbe. Some of you aficionados really liked it, and so did we! But business is business, so we decided to change the name to something more accessible.\nHere’s how DataGrip 1.0 looked:\n\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to imagine that this UI once felt slick and modern, but that’s a good reminder that 10 years is a long time. We actually tried to recreate the same IDE state in late 2025. Here’s the result:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would like to thank you, our valued users, for being with us for so many years – for reporting issues in our tracker, for the heated discussions about flow-breaking features (one of which is even happening right now), and for recommending our tool to others. If anyone reading this post has been using DataGrip for 10 consecutive years, starting with version 1.0, please let us know in the comments section.\nBirthdays are a time to receive presents, but today we’ve decided to give one instead. To celebrate the occasion, we’ve put together a list of 10 hidden DataGrip gems for you!\nThe hidden gems\nThese are ten features that even people on the DataGrip team have never heard about 😬\n\n\n\n\n1. Completion of words from open files: Alt/Opt+/\n\nLet’s start with a text editor feature that has existed for decades in the IntelliJ Platform: cyclic word completion.\nThis feature helps you complete any word from the currently open files.\nPress Alt/Opt+/ to search for matching words and repeat until you find the one you need. In SQL, this is especially useful for completing values inside INSERT statements: Just keep all the possible values in an open scratch file!\n\n\n\n\n2. Recent Locations\nSome of you already know about the Recent Files (Ctrl/Cmd+E) feature. It helps a lot when you need to reopen something you’ve accidentally closed. But it has a sister feature: Recent Locations.\nThis pop-up allows you to search for a specific change, or a recently viewed or edited piece of text – most likely, your latest SQL query.\nInvoke it using Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+E, and the list of recently viewed files will display not only the file name but also code snippets around the area you last viewed in the file. Invoke the same shortcut again, and only the changed files will remain visible.\nThe best part? Speed search works here, meaning you can type code to filter the results even further.\n\n\n\n\n3. Background image\nThis one is for those of you who love to customize everything under the sun. You can set any image as a custom background for the editor and all tool windows in DataGrip. To configure this, go to Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance | UI Options | Background Image.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Generating schema dump with the SQL generator\nThe SQL generator is a powerful mechanism for generating a DDL statement for any kind of object or set of objects. You can invoke it either from the database tree or directly from the code editor. To do so, simply use the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd+Alt/Opt+G.\nWhat’s less obvious is that you can dump the generated objects into files. This makes a lot of sense when working with an entire schema!\nAll you have to do is invoke the SQL generator on the schema, switch to File Output Options, define the layout, and click Dump. Et voila! Your schema dump is ready.\n\n\n\n\n5. Copy-pasting data sources\nAs easy as it sounds! Ctrl/Cmd+C copies your data source, and Ctrl/Cmd+V pastes it into any node of the database explorer. This is perfect for duplicating data sources or quickly creating similar ones.\nBut the real gem is that your clipboard contains nothing more than an XML snippet describing your data source. This means it can be shared across different IDEs or machines! Send it to your colleague in Slack, and they’ll be able to connect to this data source by pasting the XML into their database explorer. The only thing that isn’t copied is the password; that needs to be re-entered.\n\n\n\n\nMore tips on how to share data sources are here.\n6. Local history for folders in the Files tool window\n\nAccidentally deleted a file or even an entire folder? Not only does the famous Local History feature let you go back in time within a text file, but it can also restore files and folders themselves! \nTo do that, just right-click on a folder in the Files tool window and select Show History | Local History.\n\n\n\n\n7. Regions for SQL in the File Structure popup\n\nThe custom region folding feature in DataGrip lets you define your own collapsible sections in SQL code using specially formatted comments. This helps you hide or show these blocks by Ctrl/Cmd+Minus and Ctrl/Cmd+Plus. \n\n\n\n\nEven more importantly, however, you can see the labels in the File Structure pop-up. Press Ctrl/Cmd+F12 to see the list of your queries – or regions of queries!\nWhat’s especially cool is that you can run your SQL code with Ctrl/Cmd+Enter right from there!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Node as a table in the database explorer\nIn the database explorer, each node can be presented as a table. For example, you can get a list of all tables in a schema with their properties. Just press F4 on the tables node.\nAll the data editor features are available to you: search, filtering, exporting, and more.\n\n\n\n\nWhat if you want to see the list of all PostgreSQL functions with unsafe concurrency kind? Sure, you could write a query, but it’s much easier in DataGrip: just open the node as a table and use a local filter!\n\n\n\n\n9. Calculator\nThis may not be the most useful feature, but we bet it’s the most hidden one. The All tab in Search Everywhere has a calculator! Simply paste the expression you need into the search field to retrieve the result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10. Ability to attach a database object in the AI chat\nWriting any feature digest post in 2025 is impossible without mentioning AI. Today’s hidden gem in that category is the ability to attach database objects to the chat.\nThe database context you provide can be even more specific than the schema. You can attach the database object you need to work with – for example, a table or a view. This can be particularly useful when you’re working with larger schemas.\nTo attach a database object, type @ or # in the input field, select or type dbObject:, and then select the object you want to attach from the list.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today! Let us know in the comments section how many of these features you were already aware of.\nDevelop with pleasure! 😉\nThe DataGrip team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "C and C++ are the backbone of modern software. Operating systems, databases, game engines, and compilers all trace their roots to these languages. They give developers low-level control over memory, hardware, and performance. It’s a level of control that has defined decades of software development. However, the landscape has shifted, and the Rust vs. C++ conversation has become central to how teams approach modern systems programming.\nFor a long time, choosing C++ was straightforward. It offered speed, power, and reliability. But today, developers have one more option: Rust. Rust keeps many of the benefits of C++ while addressing some of its most persistent challenges, including memory safety, undefined behavior, and concurrency issues. It also comes with a modern, integrated toolchain that can make development smoother and less error-prone.\nSince its 2010 debut, Rust has evolved from a niche project to a serious contender for systems programming. Its design enforces safety at compile time through concepts like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. Developers can write high-performance code without risking memory leaks or undefined behavior.\nTLDR: C++ and Rust are both high-performance systems programming languages with different strengths. C++ is mature and flexible, offering low-level control and a vast ecosystem, while Rust emphasizes memory safety, concurrency, and modern tooling. Benchmarks show comparable performance, but Rust reduces runtime bugs through compile-time checks, whereas C++ relies on programmer discipline. Both languages are complementary, and the best choice depends on project needs, legacy requirements, and priorities for safety or control.\nRust’s philosophy: safety and speed\nRust’s design is deliberate. Every value has a single owner. Passing it to a function either transfers ownership or borrows it temporarily. The compiler checks these rules at compile time.\nThis system prevents memory leaks, dangling pointers, and data races before the program even runs. Rust allows unsafe code, but it must be clearly marked.\nIn short, Rust gives developers control without the common pitfalls of C++. It is safe by default and fast by design. C++ can offer similar power, but its safety relies heavily on the experience and discipline of the programmer.\nHead-to-head: C++ versus Rust performance\nLook at most benchmarking tests, and there’s a common theme: in a Rust vs C++ battle, Rust will win a few measures, but C++ will win by a few more. (Albeit by a small margin, typically sub-10%.) What matters here is that pure performance scores don’t tell the whole story. But first, some sources. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Computer Languages Benchmark Game is an ongoing project that compares languages on common algorithms like binary trees, regex, and n-body simulations. C and C++ tend to win out, but Rust is often within 5–10%  – and beats the older language on some measures.\nNicholas Nethercote’s Rust Performance Book shows how Rust performs on real-world codebases rather than distinct microbenchmarks, and the difference is telling. On “idiomatic” tasks like parsing data and spawning threads, Rust often parallels or beats C/C++. \nData from Phoronix details some cases where Rust is a clear winner – including PNG decoding, where Rust-based memory-safe decoders “vastly outperformed” libraries for C thanks to efficient concurrency and safer memory handling.\nAn Arxiv paper by Patrik Karlson compared matrix multiplication, merge sort, and file I/O operations – revealing C++ performs better at matrix math, but Rust beats it in merge sort, for similar overall performance when the benchmarks balance out.\n\n\n\n\nFor any benchmark pitting C++ against Rust, the C++ solution is probably more optimized than the Rust version; there are simply more C++ programmers out there with more years of experience. And straight benchmarks don’t show any of the sweat, toil, and tears behind the algorithm, such as how many times the C++ developer has to recompile versus a Rust counterpart. Coding isn’t just about benchmark scores; it’s about the process and reliability of the code\nThe pure benchmarks show roughly equivalent performance numbers, with Rust a few percent behind most of the time. So in domains demanding the last drop of low‑latency speed, C++ is marginally ahead. But here’s the insight: C++’s lead comes from “lab conditions” tests, and that lead disappears in “real world” tests. \nIn other words, in the messy reality of a real coding team solving real problems, Rust draws level with C++ and is often ahead. And when you stir Rust’s strengths into the mix – like memory and thread safety guarantees – there are further surprises in store.\nQuick Summary:\nRust: slightly behind in pure benchmarks, safer concurrency\nC++: slightly ahead in microbenchmarks, requires high skill for safety\nTaking out the trash: memory safety in C++ and Rust\nC++ relies on manual memory management. Developers use raw pointers like new and delete or smart ones like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr to manage object lifetimes. (Dev tools can catch many issues, but not 100% reliably.) So the C++ coder spends countless hours dealing with memory leaks, dangling pointers, and buffer overflows.\nRust enforces strict rules at compile time through a system of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. Every value in Rust has a single owner; if that ownership moves – as in passing a variable to a function – the original reference is invalidated unless deliberately borrowed across, with a “borrow checker” in the Rust compiler catching miscreants before the code is ready to run. \nHere’s a handy table of the key differences.\n\nFeatureRustC++\nMemory allocationAutomatic via ownership and lifetimesManual via raw pointers and smart pointers\nDeallocationHandled deterministically when owner goes out of scopeMust be made explicit or managed with smart pointers\nDangling pointer protectionGuaranteed at compile time with borrow checkerNo compile-time guarantees and a common source of bugs\nUse-after-freeCaught at compile timeUndefined behaviour\nDouble freePrevented by ownership modelMust be manually avoided\nConcurrency safetyEnforced at compile time, so no data races unless explicitly markedNo automatic protection, with data races common\nNull pointer issuesOption<T> replaces nullable pointers in safe codeNull dereferencing is often a cause of crashes\nUnsafe codeAllowed but must be clearly markedThe usual case, with all code potentially unsafe\nToolingCompiler enforces safety before runtimeTools needed for runtime detection\n\n\n\n\n\nRust’s system reduces runtime bugs and improves reliability. C++ offers maximum freedom, but safety depends entirely on the developer’s discipline.\nAddressing complexity: the systems programmer’s learning curve\nNeither C++ nor Rust is an easy language for coding newbies. Both are industrial-strength tools, used to build operating systems, graphics engines, embedded systems, and other critical software. Writing reliable code in these languages requires focus, discipline, and careful planning.\nRust can feel particularly challenging at first. Its borrow checker, ownership model, and lifetimes introduce concepts that many developers have not encountered before. For programmers coming from Python, or Java, the compiler may seem strict, but this strictness prevents many types of bugs before the code runs. Certain patterns, such as shared mutable state or cyclic data structures, work differently in Rust, which can make initial prototyping slower.\nSome coders have compared it to flying a plane: ultimately you’ll travel faster, but there are far more checks and tests to do before you get off the ground. \nC++ is not easier. Its large feature set, templates, and legacy complexity can be overwhelming, even for experienced programmers. Reading and maintaining complex C++ code is notoriously difficult, and many developers cite this as a persistent challenge.\nThe key difference is that Rust catches many potential issues at compile time. Unsafe operations are still possible, but the compiler clearly flags them. Over the life of a project, this leads to fewer runtime crashes, more predictable performance, and safer, more maintainable code.\nTo help developers navigate Rust’s learning curve, JetBrains offers several educational resources:\nRust exercises in RustRover Vitaly Bragilevsky’s blog introduces RustRover’s built-in practice experience and explains how the environment guides learners through Rust concepts with real-time feedback. The post will give you an overview of how the exercises work inside the IDE.\nLearn Rust plugin (compatible with RustRover and CLion): A guided learning plugin that teaches Rust fundamentals through interactive lessons, editor hints, and instant feedback. It works in both RustRover and CLion, so developers can learn inside the IDE while writing real code.\n100 Exercises to Learn Rust : Based on 100 Exercises to Learn Rust by Mainmatter’s Luca Palmieri, this course gives you a hands-on, test-driven path through Rust, starting with your first println! and progressing to advanced concepts like ownership, lifetimes, pattern matching, and generics.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these resources, developers can build confidence in Rust gradually. While the learning curve is initially steep, the payoff is significant: safer code, fewer bugs, and more predictable development outcomes.\nTooling up: assessing C++ and Rust toolchain philosophies\nWhile they’re far more accessible today than 20 years ago, low-level languages can make taking applications from beta to gold a Hard Problem. This means tooling is critical to productivity. C++ has long been the power player, but Rust with a more modern design philosophy and greater focus on developer experience, gives a strong showing. \nHere’s our head-to-head.\nC++: it’s powerful, but fragmented\nC++ has a rich ecosystem, but it’s decentralized, with tools often optimized for a specific environment or purpose. \nDiverse build systems like Make, CMake, Meson, Bazel, and Ninja mean C++ developers spend a lot of time getting builds to work consistently across platforms. The State of C++ 2025 report provides a clear overview of how these tools are used in practice across many teams and platforms.\nPackage managers, including vcpkg, conan, hunter, and others, compete vigorously, but there’s no consensus or standards informing the contest, increasing complexity.\nThe compilers – gcc, clang, MSVC, and more – each have their own quirks, flags, and extension sets; this means writing portable C++ needs ultra-deep toolchain awareness.\nStatic analysis tools like clang-tidy, cppcheck, and Coverity can detect issues, but they’re hard to set up, especially for newcomers learning the C family.\nIDEs like Microsoft’s Visual Studio and JetBrains’ own CLion, Rider, and ReSharper C++ (the JetBrains extension for Visual Studio) offer very mature support, but some advanced features still require additional plugins, which adds setup work for developers.\nSumming up: while C++ offers great freedom and maturity in its tool space, the developer experience is inconsistent … and often demands in-depth knowledge to navigate effectively.\n\n\n\n\nYou can try Rust right inside CLion. The Rust plugin is free for everyone and works seamlessly with your existing C++ setup. Use both languages in one IDE and switch between them whenever you need. \nTry CLion\n                                                                Try RustRover plugin\n                                    \nRust: the “all batteries included” option\nRust ships with a unified, opinionated toolchain that just works:\ncargo, Rust’s combined package manager and build system, handles compilation, dependencies, testing, benchmarking, documentation, and publishing in one box. Compared to C++, there’s no need to configure makefiles or wrangle libraries by hand.\nRust’s toolchain installer and updater, rustup, lets coders switch between versions or targets without the gaps showing, while its IDEs RustRover from JetBrains offer smart autocomplete, inline type hints, and compiler-powered refactors.\nWith built-in formatting and linting, rustfmt and clippy let the Rust pro enforce style and catch common pitfalls before runtime, without needing third-party tools.\nExcellent documentation tooling – cargo doc generates browsable HTML docs automatically from inline comments. It’s not perfect, but it works. \nRust shows a clear advantage here: its newer tools are well-integrated, perform fast, and are largely standardized across the ecosystem. Once a coder joins the ranks of the Rustaceans (often from a C++ background) he/she will find sharper tools in the toolbox.\nTry RustRover\n                                                    \nCommunities, ecosystems, and demographics\nC++ has a long history, dating back to the 1970s, and it remains a cornerstone of modern software. Its community is global, with strong presence in North America, Europe, China, and India. C++ is widely taught at universities, and there are over 13 million C/C++ developers worldwide. \nMany are experienced professionals, with a significant portion of over 35 years. This depth of expertise and documentation means that for systems-level programming, almost any problem has been solved before, providing a strong support network for developers.\nRust, by contrast, belongs to a younger generation of languages. Its community is enthusiastic, fast-growing, and increasingly influential. Around 46% of Rust developers are under 30, while more than a quarter are in their 40s. Two-thirds have less than ten years of coding experience. Despite its relative youth, Rust has consistently been named the “most loved language” by Stack Overflow for nine years in a row. Most Rust developers use the language for hobbies or side projects, but professional adoption is steadily increasing.\nhttps://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology\n\n\n\nBoth communities face similar demographic challenges: fewer than 6% of developers are female. Beyond demographics, the communities differ philosophically. C++ reflects decades of established practices and legacy systems, while Rust emphasizes modern safety, concurrency, and developer ergonomics.\nC++ will remain a dominant force in systems programming for years due to its installed base and mature ecosystem. Rust, however, is gaining traction rapidly, attracting developers with its safety-first approach, modern tooling, and growing library ecosystem. Both communities provide strong support for developers, but each reflects the priorities and challenges of the era in which the language has evolved.\nSome use cases: the best fit for C/C++ and Rust\nChoosing between C++, Rust, and their differing ecosystems isn’t just about syntax or performance. There’s a long list of other things to consider: the demands of the project, the maturity of the team, the environment in which the code will live, the toolchains available and understood. \nBoth languages offer their users incredible power. They allow precise control and high performance. But they approach safety, tooling, and ergonomics very differently. Let’s summarize the differences with their strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases.\nShort overview of C++\n\nCategorySummary\nKey strengthsBroad platform support across industries; Extremely high performance; Mature ecosystem with deep domain libraries; Rich selection of compilers and toolchains; large and experienced talent pool\nKey weaknessesManual memory management risks; Fragmented tooling; Undefined behaviors that surface as runtime issues; Accumulated complexity from decades of language evolution\nBest use casesReal-time and performance-critical systems; Extending or maintaining legacy C/C++ codebases; Game development; Embedded systems in automotive, industrial, consumer, and IoT environments\n\n\n\n\n\nSummarizing the Rustacean worldview: here are the pluses and minuses for the newer language. \nShort overview of Rust\n\nCategorySummary\nKey strengthsMemory and thread safety are enforced at compile time. Modern and unified tooling; (cargo, clippy, rust-analyzer)Safe concurrency; Strong documentation and package ecosystem.Eliminates broad classes of C/C++ style bugs\nKey weaknessesA steeper learning curve and smaller talent pool; Slower compile times; A less developed ecosystem for narrow or highly specialized domains\nBest use casesSecurity-sensitive software; Safety-critical embedded systems; New systems programming, such as kernels, drivers, and file systems; Concurrency-heavy services; Greenfield infrastructure where maintainability and safety must be engineered from the start\n\n\n\n\n\nWrapping all up: A fair comparison with bright futures for both\nC++ and Rust are less competitors and more companions. C++ is the battle-hardened veteran: proven, powerful, and deeply embedded in industrial software, game engines, and high-performance computing. Rust is the insurgent: modern, safe by default, and designed to prevent the mistakes C++ leaves to the programmer’s discipline.\nThis comparison isn’t about choosing a winner. Each language excels in different contexts. C++ gives expert developers maximum control across any platform. Rust trades some flexibility for reliability, catching many issues at compile time and making projects safer in the long run.\nBoth languages continue evolving. C++ adds modern features like ranges, concepts, and improved memory models. Rust improves compilation speed, performance, and ecosystem depth while gaining adoption across industries.\nRust didn’t come to replace C++. It provides another option: safe, fast, and enjoyable once you’re on top of the learning curve. The future isn’t C++ or Rust. It’s both, used where each makes the most sense.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Over the past few weeks, after we announced ACP protocol support, I’ve gotten lots of messages asking something along these lines: “Microsoft just launched AgentHQ for GitHub and VS Code. So, does this mean JetBrains will drop ACP? Will you only support your own thing now?”\nThe quick answer: We’re not picking sides.\nHere’s why – and what it means for you.\nACP and AgentHQ: What’s the difference?\nFirst, let’s clear up a common confusion:\nACP (Agent Client Protocol) is something on which JetBrains is working with Zed. It’s an open, neutral way for IDEs and editors (like IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, Zed) to talk directly to coding agents – letting them open files, suggest edits, run tests, and more. Think of it like LSP (Language Server Protocol), but designed specifically for AI agents. Cool, right?\n\n\n\n\nAgentHQ, launched by GitHub, is different. It’s yet a centralized system – like mission control – for managing AI agents inside the GitHub ecosystem and VS Code. It handles tasks, permissions, governance, and integration deeply tied to GitHub services. Also cool, but different cool, right?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn short: ACP is an open “language” any IDE or agent can speak. AgentHQ is a GitHub-specific platform for managing agents.\nOur stance at JetBrains\nVery simply: We’re committed to openness.\nWe want you to use any agent you prefer, whether it comes from us, GitHub, or anywhere else. That means:\nWe’ll support multiple protocols. ACP is open and neutral, but if another standard (like those from Microsoft or others) becomes popular with developers, we’ll happily integrate it too.\n\n\n\n\nNo lock-in. We built ACP because we believe in portable agents. Your agent shouldn’t be trapped in one IDE or cloud – it should work everywhere you need it to.\n\n\n\n\nNo secrets. We have no inside track on Microsoft’s future plans regarding ACP or their own protocols. We’re making our choices based on what’s available now, not speculation.\nWhat this means for agent builders\nIf you’re currently building agents, here’s the practical advice:\nUse whatever works best for your users. If they’re heavy GitHub users, integrate with AgentHQ. If they use multiple IDEs and editors (like JetBrains IDEs, Zed, or others), ACP is a straightforward way to ensure your agent works everywhere.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t wait around for “one protocol to rule them all.” Technology evolves quickly. ACP is stable, open, and usable now. Microsoft’s stack is also real and viable now. Support both if needed – do what serves your users best.\nThe future we’re building\nOur vision at JetBrains is straightforward:\nAgents should be portable. Your agents should easily move between JetBrains IDEs, VS Code, and beyond.\n\n\n\n\nYou shouldn’t be locked into a single vendor. Competing should be about creating great user experiences, not proprietary walls – and we’re committed to support what is adopted by the market.\n\n\n\n\n\nACP is our way to make sure agents and IDEs communicate openly. GitHub’s AgentHQ contributes to managing agents at scale. These things don’t conflict – they complement each other.\nWe’re here to help you do your best work, wherever and however you want to do it.\nWe’ll keep our protocols open, our integrations flexible, and our focus on what’s best for developers – no exceptions.\nDenis, Head of AI DevTools Ecosystem",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Satish Subrahmanya, draft.dev.\nIt’s 4:47 pm on a Friday. Your feature branch just passed all tests locally, and the code review went smoothly, so you hit the merge button. But then it happens: The CI build fails. The same test suite that passed five minutes ago is now showing red. You rerun it. Green. You run it again. Red.\nYou’ve run into a flaky test. If you’ve spent any time in software development, you’ve likely lost hours (or days) to flaky tests. They make you question your sanity, distrust your CI pipeline, and, worst of all, train your team to click Rerun build instead of investigating actual failures.\nBut that doesn’t have to be your reality. This article shows how TeamCity automatically detects and marks flaky tests, reduces false positives, and helps teams get clarity on test failures through built-in history, investigations, and mutes.\nWhat makes tests flaky\nFlaky tests fail randomly due to timing issues, dependencies, external services, or resource contention rather than code changes.\nLet’s look at a few examples of how this plays out:\n1. The race-condition trap:\n@Test\n\npublic void testAsyncEmailNotification() {\n\n    User user = createUser(\"test@example.com\");\n\n    orderService.placeOrder(user, items);\n\n    // This might work locally but fail in CI\n\n    Thread.sleep(100); // The \"hope and pray\" approach\n\n    assertEquals(1, emailService.getSentEmails().size());\n\n}\n2. The test-order-dependency dance:\npublic class UserServiceTest {\n\n    private static UserRepository userRepo = new UserRepository();\n\n    @Test\n\n    public void testCreateUser() {\n\n        User user = new User(\"alice@example.com\");\n\n        userRepo.save(user);\n\n        assertEquals(1, userRepo.count()); // Passes when run alone\n\n    }\n\n    @Test \n\n    public void testDeleteUser() {\n\n        // Assumes testCreateUser ran first - classic mistake\n\n        User user = userRepo.findByEmail(\"alice@example.com\");\n\n        assertNotNull(user); // Fails when run in isolation\n\n    }\n\n}\n3. The external-service roulette:\ndef test_api_integration():\n\n    # This test's success depends on an external service\n\n    response = requests.get(\"https://api.example.com/current\")\n\n    assert response.status_code == 200  # Until the API is down\n\n    assert \"data\" in response.json()  # Or returns different data\n4. The resource-contention chaos:\ndescribe('Database Connection Pool', () => {\n\n    it('should handle concurrent connections', async () => {\n\n        const promises = [];\n\n        // Works fine locally with 4 cores, fails on CI with 2 cores\n\n        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n\n            promises.push(db.query('SELECT * FROM users'));\n\n        }\n\n        const results = await Promise.all(promises);\n\n        expect(results).toHaveLength(100); // Sometimes 98, sometimes 100\n\n    });\n\n});\nEvery flaky test erodes trust in your CI/CD pipeline and costs real development time.\nThe default: Handling flaky tests in Jenkins\nIf you’re working with a legacy system like Jenkins, handling flaky tests requires various plugins and custom scripts.\nHere are a few examples you might be familiar with:\nThe “fingers crossed” retry pattern:\n// Jenkinsfile - Hope dies last\n\npipeline {\n\n    agent any\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Test') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                retry(3) {\n\n                    sh 'npm test'\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nThe plugin-roulette game:\n<hudson.plugins.flaky__test__handler.FlakyTestResultAction>\n\n    <testData>\n\n        <test>\n\n            <className>PaymentServiceTest</className>\n\n            <testName>testConcurrentPaymentProcessing</testName>\n\n            <flakyRuns>17</flakyRuns>\n\n            <totalRuns>234</totalRuns>\n\n        </test>\n\n    </testData>\n\n</hudson.plugins.flaky__test__handler.FlakyTestResultAction>\nThe “someone will fix this eventually” workaround:\n// The workaround we all know\n\nstage('Run Tests') {\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            def testPassed = false\n\n            def attempts = 0\n\n            while (!testPassed && attempts < 3) {\n\n                try {\n\n                    sh 'mvn test'\n\n                    testPassed = true\n\n                } catch (Exception e) {\n\n                    attempts++\n\n                    echo \"Test failed, attempt ${attempts}/3\"\n\n                    if (attempts >= 3) {\n\n                        currentBuild.result = 'UNSTABLE'\n\n                        testPassed = true\n\n                    }\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nIn addition to the effort required for manual setup, the maintenance tax and fragility of all these plugins and scripts increase with scale.\nJenkins remains popular for good reasons: It’s open source and highly customizable. Many teams have built stable CI/CD workflows on top of it. But when flaky tests are affecting developer confidence and productivity, you might have reached the limitations of this plugin-first approach. \nHow to handle flaky tests in TeamCity\nInstead of relying on workarounds, TeamCity’s built-in test intelligence gives you direct visibility into test history, automatic flaky test detection, and tools for managing investigations and mutes.\nDetecting flaky tests automatically\nTeamCity automatically detects and surfaces problematic tests, removing the need for manual tracking and allowing you to focus on fixing them rather than finding them.\nWhen a test fails and then passes (or vice versa) on the same code revision, TeamCity recognizes this pattern as flakiness:\n// CONCEPTUAL REPRESENTATION - How TeamCity detects flaky tests\n\n// Not literal DSL - illustrates the detection logic\n\nclass FlakyTestDetector {\n\n    fun analyzeTestHistory(test: TestResult): TestStatus {\n\n        val recentRuns = getTestHistory(test.id, limit = 10)\n\n        val flipRate = calculateFlipRate(recentRuns)\n\n        val sameRevisionFlips = detectSameRevisionFlips(recentRuns)\n\n        return when {\n\n            sameRevisionFlips > threshold -> TestStatus.FLAKY\n\n            flipRate > 0.2 -> TestStatus.POTENTIALLY_FLAKY\n\n            else -> TestStatus.STABLE\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nThe platform marks tests as flaky using flip-rate heuristics and same-revision flip rules (when a test’s status flips on the same code revision), and it displays badges with links to the first failure and full history in the UI.\nThese signals are visible in TeamCity’s Tests and Problems views, with links to the first failure and test history:\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what you see in the Tests tab:\nBuild Results → Tests tab\n├── ✅ UserServiceTest (15 passed)\n├── ⚠️  PaymentServiceTest (14 passed, 1 flaky)\n│   ├── ✅ testSinglePayment\n│   ├── ✅ testPaymentValidation\n│   └── 🔄 testConcurrentPaymentProcessing [FLAKY – flip rate: 23%]\n└── ✅ OrderServiceTest (22 passed)\nSeparating flaky tests\nTeamCity’s reporting UI separates test failures from build configuration issues, which simplifies investigation.\nThe navigation path is as follows:\nBuild Results > Tests tab: See flaky badges and failure reasons\nProblems tab: Filter test failures vs. build problems\nMy Investigations page: Assign ownership of flaky tests\nMutes dialog: Set scope and unmute policy\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring smart test retries\nA smart retry strategy helps separate genuine defects from one-off glitches such as network hiccups, database contention, or timeouts.\nInstead of rerunning an entire build, TeamCity lets you configure targeted retries at the test framework level:\nFor .NET projects: Starting with TeamCity 2024.03, the .NET (VSTest) runner includes built-in retry support. This means you can set a retry count and delay directly in the runner configuration.\nFor JVM projects (Gradle): Use the Gradle Test Retry plugin to automatically rerun only the failed test cases, not the whole suite.\n// build.gradle - JUnit 5 filtering + Gradle Test Retry\n\nplugins {\n\n    id(\"java\")\n\n    id(\"org.gradle.test-retry\") version \"1.5.9\" // or latest\n\n}\n\ntest {\n\n    useJUnitPlatform()\n\n    // Include tags passed via -DincludeTags=flaky\n\n    def include = System.getProperty(\"includeTags\")\n\n    if (include) {\n\n        useJUnitPlatform { \n\n            includeTags include.split(\",\").collect { it.trim() }.findAll { it }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    // Retry logic (preserves signal, doesn't hide failures)\n\n    retry {\n\n        maxRetries = System.getProperty(\"retryCount\")?.toInteger() ?: 0\n\n        failOnPassedAfterRetry = false\n\n    }\n\n}\nFor Maven projects: Configure the Surefire plugin with rerunFailingTestsCount so that transient issues get a second chance without hiding persistent failures.\nHere’s an example for Maven:\n<!-- pom.xml -->\n\n<plugin>\n\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n\n    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n\n    <version>3.2.5</version>\n\n    <configuration>\n\n        <rerunFailingTestsCount>2</rerunFailingTestsCount>\n\n    </configuration>\n\n</plugin>\nImplementing the mute-and-monitor pattern\nEven with retries, some flaky tests remain too noisy to leave in the mainline build. You want to keep your pipeline green without losing visibility into these tests. \nTeamCity’s Mute feature allows you to silence failures in the main build while still running and tracking the tests in the background. While TeamCity doesn’t have a literal “quarantine” feature, you can achieve the same effect using this pattern:\nMute → Monitor → Stabilize → Unmute\nMute the flaky test with a clear reason and manual unmute policy.\nKeep the mainline build green – muted tests don’t cause test failures.\nRun a scheduled “flaky only” build that retries these tests under controlled conditions.\nRequire a number of consecutive passes before unmuting.\nUnmute once the test is stable and trustworthy again.\nYou can also pair muting with investigations: Assign someone to monitor the flaky test, track its history, and decide when it’s safe to restore it to the main suite.\nHere’s a Kotlin DSL snippet showing how you might keep flaky tests running separately while preserving a stable main build:\n// TeamCity Kotlin DSL - Production configuration\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.v2019_2.*\n\nobject MainBuild : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Main Test Suite\"\n\n    steps {\n\n        gradle {\n\n            tasks = \"test\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    failureConditions {\n\n        testFailure = true  // Build fails on real test failures\n\n    }\n\n    // Note: muted tests run but do not affect build status by design\n\n})\n\nobject FlakyTestMonitoring : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Flaky Test Stabilization\"\n\n    triggers {\n\n        schedule {\n\n            schedulingPolicy = daily {\n\n                hour = 2\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        gradle {\n\n            tasks = \"test\"\n\n            // Run tests tagged as flaky with retries\n\n            gradleParams = \"-DincludeTags=flaky -DretryCount=3\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nFAQ\nHow does TeamCity detect flaky tests?\nTeamCity detects flaky tests through flip-rate analysis and same-revision flip detection – when tests pass/fail on identical code.\nWhat’s the difference between muting and skipping?\nMuted tests still run (preserving signal), but they don’t fail the build. Skipped tests don’t execute at all.\nCan I automate the unmute process?\nTeamCity supports auto-unmute policies, but for flaky tests, manually unmuting after n consecutive passes is recommended to avoid false confidence.\nConclusion\nTeamCity helps you manage flaky tests through flip-rate detection, test-history tracking, and the mute-and-monitor pattern:\nAutomatic detection and clear UI signals reduce time wasted on false positives.\nDirect navigation paths and the ability to assign ownership help you manage flaky tests efficiently.\nSmart retries filter out transient failures without hiding real issues.\nMuting keeps flaky tests visible without blocking the mainline build.\nYou might even feel brave enough to deploy on a Friday!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Previously in this series:\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 1: A Minimal Coding Agent\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 2: A Deeper Dive Into Tools\nTwo articles in, and our coding agent can already do quite a bit. It can explore projects, read and write code, execute shell commands, and run tests. Adding a definition of done (DoD) in our last article gave it the feedback loop it needed – the agent now iterates until all tests pass, not until it decides it’s done.\nWe should be celebrating, right? Well, yes and no.\nAs the agent gets more capable, debugging becomes more challenging. Each tool adds surface area. The DoD loop adds more calls and tokens. Evaluation runs can take hours, and when something fails, it is often unclear what failed or where the issue started.\nOur agent can solve tasks now. Too bad we can’t see how.\nThis becomes a problem when you want to improve the agent, debug failures, or estimate costs. In this article, we work through this visibility gap. We start with the obvious options (they don’t quite work), review common observability tools for LLM apps, and integrate tracing with Langfuse. The result is a step-by-step view of the agent’s actions, including cost per action. Along the way, we uncover behavioral patterns and even find a bug we didn’t know existed.\nLet’s start by understanding what we’re missing.\nYour agent story\nWhen your agent completes a coding task, it produces a chain of decisions and actions: Read this file, analyze that function, modify this code, run those tests. This chain is the agent’s trajectory, and it tells the story of how the agent works.\nTrajectories matter because they reveal where the agent wastes time and where it goes off track. They show you when the agent reads the same file 47 times, or why it rewrites half your codebase when you asked for a simple bug fix. In short, you can’t improve what you can’t observe.\nUp to now, we’ve been getting by with this simple setup:\nhandleEvents {  \n    onToolCallStarting { ctx ->  \n        println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")  \n    }  \n}\nThis was fine for the early steps. It at least showed activity. But we’ve outgrown it. Without full parameters and observations, we can’t understand agent behavior in enough detail. And if we print everything, the console turns into noise: object dumps, file contents, and error messages all mixed together.\nWe need something better.\n“Just turn on logging”\nLet’s try the obvious solution first. Koog has built-in debug logging, so we switch Logback from ERROR to DEBUG and run it again:\n\n\n\n\nThree minutes and thousands of lines later: Informative? Yes. Convenient? No! \nVerbose logs have their place. In production, they help with postmortems. They also help when you want to extract insights and analyze behavior patterns across many runs. But when you’re debugging a single run and trying to understand why your agent is stuck in a loop, you need something built for humans, not statistical analysis.\nThe money trail\nWhile those logs aren’t ideal for debugging, they did remind us about something else we should be tracking: usage statistics. OpenAI’s dashboard provides detailed breakdowns of API consumption per key. It answers one question quickly: Are we burning through our budget?\nBut it still doesn’t answer the question that matters during development: What does one run cost?\n\n\n\n\nOkay, $25 in one week. Useful, but not the complete picture. The OpenAI dashboard does what it’s designed to do: track organization-level API usage. But for agent development, we need run-level insights. We can see the total, but not which tasks cost $0.50 and which cost $5.00.\nNow add more moving parts. If we split work across sub-agents and use different providers for specific steps (to be discussed in upcoming articles), we end up with multiple dashboards and no single view of the true cost of a run. And if several people share the same agent setup, it gets even harder to see who spent what and where.\nThe API key approach works for one agent, one provider, and limited runs. It’s a start, but it doesn’t scale. We need observability.\nThe four-line integration\nWe’re not the first to encounter this issue. Over the last few years, an ecosystem of observability tools has formed around LLM apps and agents. There are proprietary tools such as Weights & Biases Weave and LangSmith, as well as open-source options like Langfuse, Opik, Arize Phoenix, OpenLLMetry, Helicone, OpenLIT, and Lunary. Some are cloud-based, others support self-hosting, and some offer both. Each comes with its own strengths and trade-offs.\nAfter evaluating several options, our team chose Langfuse. The decision came down to practical factors: It’s open source with a self-hosted option (so traces stay under your control), it offers a free cloud tier for getting started, the UI makes it easier to inspect traces, and the team is responsive when questions come up.\nThe integration itself is straightforward. Koog needs four lines to connect to Langfuse:\n) {\n+   install(OpenTelemetry) {  \n+       setVerbose(true) \n+       addLangfuseExporter()  \n+   }\n    handleEvents {  \n        // existing handlers remain\n    }\n}\nThat’s it.\nIf you use another OpenTelemetry-compatible service, generic OpenTelemetry integration works as well.\nA quick note about the setVerbose(true): Koog sends only telemetry metadata by default. Full details are sent only if you enable verbose mode. Prompts and responses remain hidden, which makes sense when traces can include customer data. During agent development, you often need full visibility, and verbose mode enables that.\nSetting up Langfuse takes about five minutes. For this article, we’re using their free cloud instance, but you can also run the full stack locally in Docker.\nCreate an account at cloud.langfuse.com.\nCreate an organization.\nCreate a project.\nClick Create API Key.\nYou’ll get three values:\nexport LANGFUSE_HOST=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\nexport LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=\"<your-public-key>\"\nexport LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=\"<your-secret-key>\"\nKoog reads these values from the execution environment. If you need to pass them in code, you can pass them directly to addLangfuseExporter. Here’s our complete agent with observability enabled:\nval executor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    promptExecutor = executor,\n    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5Codex,\n    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n        tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))\n        tool(ExecuteShellCommandTool(JvmShellCommandExecutor(), PrintShellCommandConfirmationHandler()))\n    },\n    systemPrompt = \"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled programmer tasked with updating the provided codebase according to the given task.\n        Your goal is to deliver production-ready code changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase and solve given task.\n        Ensure minimal possible changes done - that guarantees minimal impact on existing functionality.\n        \n        You have shell access to execute commands and run tests.\n        After investigation, define expected behavior with test scripts, then iterate on your implementation until the tests pass.\n        Verify your changes don't break existing functionality through regression testing, but prefer running targeted tests over full test suites.\n        Note: the codebase may be fully configured or freshly cloned with no dependencies installed - handle any necessary setup steps.\n        \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n    strategy = singleRunStrategy(ToolCalls.SEQUENTIAL),\n    maxIterations = 400\n) {\n    install(OpenTelemetry) {\n        setVerbose(true) // Send full strings instead of HIDDEN placeholders\n        addLangfuseExporter()\n    }\n    handleEvents {\n        onToolCallStarting { ctx ->\n            println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe first trace\nLet’s start with a simple task: Find the main() function in your project. Run it, wait for it to finish, and then open the Tracing tab in your Langfuse project.\n\n\n\n\nImmediately, the table displays something useful: the Total Cost column. Koog reports token counts, Langfuse applies pricing, and you can see that finding main() costs $0.016.\nOpen the trace to see the full run.\n\n\n\n\nThe left-hand panel shows your agent’s trajectory: messages, tool calls, and observations in order, with indentation indicating the call hierarchy. The right-hand panel displays details for each step: prompts, responses, tool parameters, and per-span cost breakdown.\nAt the bottom, you’ll also see an execution graph that visualizes the flow. For more details on Koog’s graph-based strategies, check out the documentation. You can also read a deep dive by the Koog tech lead: Mixing the Secret AI Sauce: How to Design a Flexible, Graph-Based Strategy in Koog.\nDiscovering issues through observability\nWhile preparing examples for this article, we noticed a failed tool call highlighted in red.\n\n\n\n\nThe observation was:\nendLine=400 must be <= lineCount=394 or -1\nThe agent requested lines 0–400, but the file had only 394 lines. This points to a limitation in our tool implementation. Instead of failing, it should clamp the range and return the available lines (0–394), allowing the agent to continue. Without traces, this kind of issue often gets buried in logs. With traces, you see it in the exact run, at the exact step, and with the exact input.\nThat’s why observability matters. It shows not just that something failed, but also how and why, which makes fixes much easier.\nWorking with evaluation runs\nSingle traces are great for debugging, but evaluation runs need a batch view. \nWhen you run your agent across multiple SWE-bench Verified tasks (a standard benchmark for coding agents), you want grouped traces and aggregated cost.\nLangfuse supports this through sessions. Add a session ID as a trace attribute:\ninstall(OpenTelemetry) {\n    setVerbose(true)\n    addLangfuseExporter(  \n        traceAttributes = listOf(  \n            CustomAttribute(\"langfuse.session.id\", \"eval-run-1\"),  \n        )  \n    )\n}\nYou can also add other attributes, such as user IDs or environment tags. See the trace-level attributes documentation if you need them. For now, session grouping is enough.\nWith this configuration, traces from the evaluation share a session ID. In Langfuse, navigate to the Sessions tab to see aggregate duration and total cost.\n\n\n\n\nIn our run, we executed 50 SWE-bench Verified tasks (out of 500). With ten parallel instances, the run took 30 minutes and cost $66. This gives a baseline for future experiments: success rate, runtime, and cost.\nLangfuse doesn’t show success scores by default. That’s expected. Tracing records what happened, not whether a run passed. If you want success metrics in Langfuse, your evaluation harness needs to score each attempt and report custom scores. It’s worth implementing if you have the supporting infrastructure.\nLooking ahead\nObservability isn’t just about debugging. It’s also how you learn about the agent’s behavior. \nWith a few lines of code, we turned the agent from a black box into something you can inspect. We caught that line-range error that would likely have gone unnoticed. We learned that our 50-task evaluation costs $66. And we can now see which tasks consume tokens and which run efficiently.\nIn the next article, we’ll introduce a sub-agent pattern: Delegate specific tasks to smaller, cheaper models. With traces in place, you can decide what to delegate based on what the agent does in each run. No more guessing.\nResources\nComplete code for this article\nKoog OpenTelemetry documentation\nKoog Langfuse integration\nLangfuse OpenTelemetry support\nThank you for reading!

That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference — the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and to contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this edition, we highlight four projects spanning Rust, Go, and JavaScript. Different as they are, each shares the same goal: keeping systems reliable.\nfrp\nOriginally created to make it easier to share local APIs with teammates, frp (Fast Reverse Proxy) has grown into a global open-source favorite. It’s lightweight, easy to configure, and supports multiple protocols – perfect for developers who need to share local services or access remote environments without complex network setup.\nAs frp grew into a complex codebase, I switched to GoLand, which significantly improved my productivity. Intelligent code completion, a powerful debugger, seamless refactoring, and intuitive navigation became indispensable in my everyday workflow.\nSince frp attracts contributors with different levels of experience, GoLand has become a vital tool in simplifying their workflows – with its ready-to-use, beginner-friendly environment, it drastically reduces the learning curve and the setup work that often frustrates beginners. I confidently recommend GoLand as the go-to IDE for contributing to frp or any other Go project.\n— fatedier, frp creator\nThe team’s roadmap includes lightweight VPN-like capabilities that will allow multiple frpc nodes to form virtual networks, along with a major v2 overhaul aimed at delivering advanced functionality across both Layer 7 (application) and Layer 4 (transport) features.\nSniffnet\nSniffnet, written entirely in Rust, lets users visualize network traffic in real time. It was designed as an intuitive, easy-to-use monitoring tool that allows anyone – not just network experts – to comfortably analyze their internet activity. Instead of unreadable packet data, Sniffnet displays clear, flow-level details such as domain names, countries, and services, giving users an immediate understanding of their network traffic.\nWhat I love most about RustRover is how seamlessly it integrates with my usual workflows – using rustfmt, clippy, and testing tools. And since I’ve used other JetBrains IDEs in the past, RustRover instantly feels like home with its familiar, intuitive interface.\n— Giuliano Bellini, Sniffnet creator\nSniffnet’s upcoming roadmap includes process identification, custom IP blacklists, remote host monitoring via an agent, and OS-level firewall integrations – all aimed at making network monitoring secure and approachable for everyone.\nVitest\nVitest was designed to be a simple testing tool for Vite applications, with a focus on the shared build configuration. Over time, it’s evolved into a go-to testing framework for fast, reliable JavaScript testing across ecosystems.\nSince the early days, JetBrains has collaborated with the team to provide the best IDE experience. My favorite feature is the debug button – I always struggled with JavaScript’s built-in debugger before trying it in WebStorm.\n— Vladimir, Vitest maintainer\nThe Vitest team continues to innovate with the latest developments of the Browser Mode and upcoming improvements to benchmarking and type-checking support – all in service of making testing easy and approachable.\nbottom\nbottom started as a personal spin on gotop and similar tools. Originally a résumé project, it gradually evolved into a popular terminal-based system monitor built in Rust. The project was originally called “rustop”, but since that name was already taken, the creator simply took things in the opposite direction and called it “bottom”!\nI regularly use RustRover for open-source projects like bottom – it’s packed with great features, and it’s convenient to stay within the JetBrains ecosystem since I use other JetBrains products at work.\n— Clement Tsang, bottom creator\nBottom proves that even the simplest tools can evolve into powerful, community-driven utilities, and that approachable design matters, even on the command line.\nThese projects showcase a common truth: Great developer experience happens when tools get out of your way. With JetBrains IDEs enhancing everything from code navigation to collaboration, these teams turn ideas into usable, elegant tools.\nExplore these projects, contribute if you can, or start your own! RustRover, WebStorm, CLion, Rider, RubyMine, DataGrip, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm are free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute.\nMore from this series\n                                                        \nCLion and the Open-Source Community: Growing Together\nFrom the beginning, CLion has been shaped by the needs of C and C++ developers around the world.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "It starts the way these things always start. \nA red build.\nA failing test.\nAnd that quiet, sinking feeling of “This worked yesterday.” \nMeet Sam. Sam’s not a junior, not a rockstar, just a solid developer who’s shipped enough code to know that bugs don’t care how confident you feel on Monday morning. \nThat test failure does not offer much help at all. There are no clear steps to reproduce the issue. The exception message seems familiar in a vague way. But it does not prove useful right then. Out of habit Sam hits F5. He notices something small yet pretty important about it. \nThe debugger launches faster than before. No long pause, no breaking his flow. Sam gets straight into debugging, and that small improvement already feels like a win. \nThe Exception Knows More Than It Used To \nThe app crashes. Sam opens the exception details. Normally, he’d read the error message, scroll through the stack trace, which shows the chain of function calls that led to the crash and start guessing what went wrong. \nThis time, things feel different. Exception Assistance ‘s Copilot analysis looked at the whole repository, not just the file in front of Sam. It checks past bugs, old pull requests, and even fixes from months ago. It notices a similar error that happened after a validation tweak, flags the code paths that might have been hit, and points to places where that odd value could have slipped in. \nIf Sam wants a different angle, he can pick any model in Copilot Chat to analyze the exception the way that fits the problem. And for trickier, nested, or chained errors, Copilot may decide it needs more context and offer to dig deeper.  Sam can continue with the deeper analysis to get a more context-driven, accurate understanding of what went wrong, without losing control of the investigation \nWhat used to take hours now feels like a conversation with a teammate who knows the history of your code and points you exactly where you need to look. \nWant to see this in action?\n\n\nInline Values: When If-Statements Stop Lying and Values Appear Where You Need Them \nSam steps through the code and lands on a conditional that should be true but is now showing false. \nNormally, you’d hover over every variable, checking them one by one but now? The result is right there. Inline in editor. The condition shows how it was evaluated.\nSam hovers and chooses Analyze with Copilot. Instead of just seeing “false,” Copilot breaks the condition apart sub-expression by sub expression showing exactly which part failed and how it affected the outcome. No stepping. No breakpoint. Just reasoning where the decision happened.  \nAs Sam moves on, he notices something else that clicks: \nMethod parameters? Inline. \nLoop variables? Inline. \nReturn values? Inline, where they’re used, not buried inside a function call.\nOne way keeps returning a value that feels wrong. Sam doesn’t step into it. Doesn’t add watches. He just hovers, asks Copilot to analyze the value, and instantly sees an explanation grounded in runtime behavior and the surrounding code. \nIt doesn’t replace DataTips or visualizers; they’re still there when Sam needs to dig deeper. But most of the time, the answer he’s looking for is already right in front of him. \nWant to see this in action?\n\nWhen a Test Fails, and You Don’t Debug Alone \nLater that day, another test failed. Different feature. Same frustration. Sam right-clicks the test and selects Debug with Copilot. \nThe Debugger Agent takes over. It looks at the test, its code, and recent changes. Then it makes a guess, applies a fix, runs the test, adjusts, and tries again. Sam watches. Not hands-off, but without the usual busy work. When it’s done, there’s a clear summary of what has changed and why. Sam reviews it, nods, and commits. \nThis isn’t giving up control.\nIt’s cutting out the repetitive stuff so Sam can focus on the important decisions. \nWant to see this in action?\n\nThe Calm at the End of Debugging \nBy the end of the day, Sam notices something important. \nThe bugs weren’t easy.\nThe code wasn’t simple.\nBut understand them? That came faster. \nVisual Studio 2026 doesn’t make debugging magic. It makes it feel like a conversation between Sam, his code, his history, and tools that get the context. By the end of the day, Sam closes the debugger feeling focused, not worn down.  \nThese improvements in Visual Studio 2026 are the first steps toward a smoother, calmer, more intuitive debugging experience, less time guessing, and more time understanding.  There’s a lot more coming, and your feedback is crucial. Tell us what works, what doesn’t, and where debugging still trips you up. \nHappy Debugging.  \nThe post Debugging, but Without the Drama (A Visual Studio 2026 Story) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Here on the Visual Studio team, our top priority is making your coding experience smoother and more enjoyable. And that begins with truly listening to your feedback. We understand that sometimes sharing your thoughts can feel like tossing bug reports and suggestions into a black hole. It doesn’t feel good, and we get it.\nBut here’s the good news: over the past year, we’ve resolved more bugs reported by users and delivered more requested features than at any other time in Visual Studio’s history. We believe in being open about what happens to your feedback, so in this post, we’ll pull back the curtain and show you exactly how your input is processed and how it directly influences our work.\nSo, grab your favorite warm drink, settle in, and join us for a behind-the-scenes look at how your feedback truly shapes the future of Visual Studio.\nEvery bug report or feature request you submit on developercommunity.visualstudio.com becomes a ticket in our system. We mirror that ticket in our internal Azure DevOps setup and assign it to the right team.\nFigure 1: The public ticket on Developer Community on the left, and the internal ticket in Azure DevOps on the right\nWe treat your feedback with the same priority as our internal tasks, triaging and prioritizing it to align with our goals and direction. In other words, who created the issue doesn’t matter. If the issue is important and impactful, we consider it.\nFigure 2: Internal and external tickets are triaged together in the same view in Azure DevOps\nSo, what makes a feedback ticket important and impactful? Your engagement on the Developer Community directly influences what we work on next. We assign an internal Score to every ticket based on community traction, impact, and severity. Each vote increases the ticket’s Score and highlights issues or ideas the community cares about. It’s important that you upvote existing tickets and add more context rather than submitting a new ticket for the same issue. Comments add context and boost the Score, helping us understand the issue or feature request’s importance. Comment on existing tickets to add more context to the issue or feature request. It all helps.\nFigure 3: A bug ticket with votes and comments\nAs a ticket’s Score rises, it can automatically escalate in priority – low, medium, or high. Medium and high-priority bugs come with Service Level Agreements (SLAs). High-priority tickets are targeted for investigation within a week, while medium-priority tickets have a longer but defined timeline.\nPriority isn’t just about votes and comments, though. Our teams weigh the Score against factors like technical complexity and alignment with goals, such as performance, reliability, and accessibility. A high Score doesn’t guarantee top priority, but it’s a major factor.\nThis system ensures that feedback from our users shapes the IDE, and that we catch bugs as early as possible. Some bugs require immediate attention, especially regressions and issues affecting key tenets like performance or accessibility.\nFigure 4: The option to rollback to a previous version in the Installer\nRegressions – cases where something that used to work breaks – are typically high priority because they disrupt your workflow. If you ever need to rollback to a prior release due to a regression or critical issue, it’s crucial to let us know. After you complete the rollback, Visual Studio asks you to submit feedback describing what led you to revert and the specific problem you encountered.\nYour input is invaluable for helping us identify, prioritize, and resolve regressions quickly so we can prevent similar disruptions in future updates. Bugs affecting core tenets like performance or accessibility also get quick attention. A slowdown in the IDE or an accessibility issue that limits usability? We prioritize those to keep Visual Studio smooth and inclusive.\nTo help us address your feedback as quickly and effectively as possible, here are some tips for writing a ticket that stands out and speeds up resolution.\nUse descriptive title: Use a title that is easy for others to find so they can vote, comment, and add more information.\nInclude clear reproduction steps: Describe exactly what you did leading up to the issue. List each step in order so we can follow your process and reliably see the problem on our end.\nAdd screenshots: Visuals make it easier to understand what’s happening. If possible, attach screenshots that highlight the issue or error message.\nUse the recording function: Consider using the built-in recording feature to capture your workflow and the issue in real time. This gives us a direct view of the problem as it occurs.\nShare a minimal reproducible project: If you can, create a simple project that demonstrates the issue. Zip up the project files and include them with your ticket submission. This helps us isolate the bug and find a solution faster.\nSometimes, we still can’t figure out what’s going on. The team can’t reproduce the issue, or the error logs just don’t give us enough to go on. When that happens, we usually reach out to you and the rest of the community for more details. We’re not trying to be a hassle; we really do want to fix the problem, but we just need a little more info to get there. Anyone can add more info to any ticket, and we encourage you to jump in if you can help.\n \nSpeaking of feedback, love that Visual Studio fixed the build status after I reported the misleading output and many of you upvoted it. The next text is much better. Your feedback matters!\n \nWhat happens if you want to open a bug on the bug reporting system itself? This is one of the feedback team’s most frequently asked questions. The answer is that you report it the exact same way as any other Visual Studio bug. Go to Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem… and fill in the ticket.\nIn conclusion…\nThe bug is there whether you tell us or not. But when you take the time to let us know about it, you’re really doing all of us – our team and other users – a huge favor. We know reporting bugs isn’t much fun, but we do our best to make it a good experience.\nIt may not always seem like it, but things are getting better. We’re fixing more bugs and adding more features now than ever before in our nearly 30 years of history. And that’s all because of you. Thank you for all your feedback over the years. It’s made a bigger difference than you can possibly imagine.\nKeep sharing your thoughts on developercommunity.visualstudio.com and in the comments below.\nThe post Behind the scenes of the Visual Studio feedback system appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "지난 7월 Rocky Linux 10이 출시되었다.[1] 하지만 로키리눅스는 오피셜한 업그레이드 방법을 제공하지 않기 때문에 약간 편법으로 업그레이드를 해야한다. 오리지널 레퍼런스는 reddit에 올라온 \"RHEL 10 upgrade from 9.6\"이다.[2] 하지만 원문에 몇 가지 자잘한 버그가 있어서 본인이 약간 수정했다. 그리고 자동화를 위해 bash script도 작성했다. 우선 오류를 수정한 원문을 요약, 정리하면 다음과 같다.\n \nHow to Upgrade Rocky Linux 9 to Rocky Linux 10\nNote: All commands require root user privileges.\nStep 0: Ensure you have root user access for all commands.\nStep 1: Enable the fastestmirror=1 option. This setting directs new package installations to the fastest available mirror site, saving time during the upgrade process.\nStep 2: Clear any versionlock settings if they exist. This is especially important if versionlock was used to prevent kernel or other critical component updates for service stability. The upgrade will fail if versionlock restrictions remain in place, so they must be removed.\nStep 3: Install the Rocky Linux 10 packages on your system: rocky-gpg-keys, rocky-release, and rocky-repos.\nStep 4: If the rocky-repos package maintains old repository files pointing to Rocky Linux 9's GPG keys, errors will occur. Find and overwrite any *.rpmnew files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.\nStep 5: Install Rocky Linux 10 using the command: dnf distro-sync\nStep 6: If you use the rpmfusion nonfree repository, the old EL9 version may remain on your system. Remove the outdated version and reinstall the Rocky Linux 10 version.\nStep 6a: Reboot the system after completing Step 6.\nStep 7: Re-enable the fastestmirror=1 option. This setting is removed during the reinstallation process and must be reconfigured.\nStep 8: Clean all temporary files using: dnf clean all\nStep 9: Remove any remaining EL9 (old version) files. Use the command: rpm -e $(rpm -qa | grep '.el9.') 2>&1 | grep 'is needed by' | awk '{print $1}' to identify packages with dependencies. For packages with unresolvable dependencies, verify if they can be updated; otherwise, force remove them.\nStep 10: Rebuild the rpm database.\nThere are two bash scripts for automation, written below. If the first script completes successfully, reboot the system and then run the second script.\n업그레이드 자동화 bash script\n위 프로세스를 자동화 하는 bash 스크립트는 다음과 같다. 스크립트 파일은 2개이며 첫번째 스크립트가 성공하면 재부팅한 뒤에 두번째 스크립트를 실행하면 된다. \nUpgrade to Rocky Linux 10\n\n\n \n업그레이드 bash script 1\n첫번째 스크립트는 Rocky Linux 9.x 에서 10.1로 업그레이드하는 스크립트이다. 본인이 작업하거나 서비스하는 서버, 컨설팅해주는 회사의 서버는 9.4와 9.6이었는데 해당 스크립트로 업그레이드에 성공하였다. 그래도 만일 실행 오류가 있다면 적절하게 AI에게 물어서 해결하도록 하면 될 것이다. 아마도 gemini, claude, copilot, chatGPT 등에 물어보면 아주 잘 대답해 줄 것이다. 참고로 docker-ce나 nvidia-driver의 업그레이드 문제는 뒤에 적어두었다.\n이 스크립트는 최대한 안전 코드를 넣어서 root 유저가 아니면 실행이 안되고, Rocky Linux 버전도 확인해서 9.x가 아니라면 작동하지 않도록 해두었다. 만일 업그레이드를 이미 한 뒤에 재실행하면 버전 체킹 때문에 실행이 중지될 것이다.\n#!/bin/bash\nROCKY_VER_SOURCE=9\nROCKY_VER=10.1\nREPO_URL=\"https://mirror.kakao.com/linux/rocky/${ROCKY_VER}/BaseOS/x86_64/os/Packages/r/\"\nPKGS_FILENAME=(\n    rocky-gpg-keys-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    rocky-release-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    rocky-repos-10.1-1.2.el10.noarch.rpm\n    )\n\nPKGS_URL=(\n    \"${PKGS_FILENAME[@]/#/$REPO_URL}\"\n    )\n\ncheck_el10_packages() {\n    local installed_count=0\n\n    for pkg_file in \"${PKGS_FILENAME[@]}\"; do\n        # .rpm을 제거하여 패키지명 추출\n        local pkg_name=\"${pkg_file%.rpm}\"\n\n        # rpm -q로 설치 여부 확인\n        if rpm -q \"$pkg_name\" > /dev/null 2>&1; then\n            ((installed_count++))\n        fi\n    done\n\n    # 1개 이상 EL10 프로그램이 설치되어 있으면 return 0\n    if [ $installed_count -gt 0 ]; then\n        return 0\n    else\n        return 1\n    fi\n}\n\necho \"Before you proceeding with the upgrade tasks below, you must first perform an update and reboot.\"\necho \"If you have already done so, press Enter.

[3]  하지만 이것도 귀찮은 분들을 위해 아래에 적어두도록 하겠다. 그냥 copy해서 root로 명령내리면 된다.\ndnf -y remove docker-ce && dnf -y config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo && dnf -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin && systemctl enable --now docker\n \n3) nvidia 드라이버 재설치\nnvidia 드라이버를 사용하는 경우에는 약간의 수고를 해야 한다. 만일 cuda가 포함된 nvidia official driver의 경우에는 Rocky Linux 9.x의 경우 dnf module 기능을 사용했을텐데, 이 기능은 Rocky Linux 10에서 deprecated되었다. 따라서 nvidia module를 완전 제거한 뒤에 다시 설치해야 한다. 아래와 같이 명령해서 제거하고, 재설치한다.\n먼저 dnf module list;로 설치된 모듈을 확인한다. 아래와 같이 nvidia-driver가 보인다면 module 설치된 경우이다.\n# dnf module list \nWARNING: modularity is deprecated, and functionality will be removed in a future release of DNF5.\nLast metadata expiration check: 0:01:06 ago on Thu 27 Nov 2025 08:40:19 PM KST.\n@modulefailsafe\nName              Stream               Profiles                 Summary                                  \nnvidia-driver     latest-dkms [e]      default [i], fm, ks      Nvidia driver for latest-dkms branch     \n\nHint: [d]efault, [e]nabled, [x]disabled, [i]nstalled\nnvidia-driver module 삭제를 위해 아래와 같이 dnf module reset nvidia;

Win32, MFC, .NET(WPF, WinForms) 같은 기술들, 그리고 좀 더 최근에는 UWP(Universal Windows Platform)나 WinUI 같은 것들이 대표적이죠. 이 앱들은 운영체제의 '모국어'를 구사하기 때문에 시스템 자원을 가장 효율적으로 사용하고, OS의 디자인 가이드라인이나 사용자 경험(UX)을 충실히 따랐습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 과거의 많은 윈도우 앱들은 정말이지 상상할 수 없을 정도로 빠르고 가벼웠습니다. Notepad++, Winamp, Paint.NET, foobar2000, Everything Search 같은 이름들을 들어보시면 아마 고개를 끄덕이실 거예요. 용량도 몇 MB에 불과한데, 실행은 눈 깜짝할 사이에 되고, RAM도 거의 사용하지 않았죠. 솔직히 저도 가끔 이런 앱들을 쓰면서 '아, 옛날 앱이 짱이지!' 하고 감탄할 때가 많아요. 구형 컴퓨터에서도 전혀 버벅거림 없이 잘 돌아가는 걸 보면, 정말이지 최적화의 극치를 보여줬다고 생각합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #0f4c81; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>네이티브 앱이란?</b> 운영체제 고유의 프레임워크를 사용하여 개발되어, OS의 기능과 자원을 가장 효율적으로 활용하는 애플리케이션을 의미합니다. 마치 그 운영체제만을 위해 태어난 것처럼, OS와 완벽하게 조화를 이루는 것이 특징이죠.</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  웹 기술 만능주의, 개발자들의 선택 'Electron'</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그런데 어느 순간부터 '네이티브 앱'이라는 단어는 점점 희미해지기 시작했습니다. 그 자리를 채운 것은 다름 아닌 웹 기술을 기반으로 한 앱들이었죠. 특히 Electron이나 PWA(Progressive Web Apps) 같은 기술들이 대세로 떠오르면서, 개발자들은 윈도우, macOS, 리눅스 등 각기 다른 운영체제별로 앱을 따로 만들 필요가 없어졌습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이게 왜 그렇게 매력적이었냐면, 한 번 HTML, CSS, JavaScript로 웹 앱을 만들면 Electron이 이 웹 앱을 마치 데스크톱 애플리케이션처럼 실행시켜 주기 때문이에요. Electron은 Chromium 브라우저 엔진과 Node.js 런타임을 통째로 앱에 포함시키는 방식인데, 덕분에 개발자들은 하나의 코드베이스만 관리하면 됩니다. 개발팀에 웹 개발자만 있어도 모든 플랫폼용 앱을 만들 수 있게 된 거죠. 반복 작업도 줄어들고, UI 변경도 훨씬 쉽습니다. 기존에 수많은 웹 라이브러리가 있다는 것도 엄청난 장점이고요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 장점들 덕분에 Slack, Discord, Figma의 데스크톱 클라이언트, Obsidian, Notion, 그리고 최근의 WhatsApp까지, 수많은 유명 앱들이 Electron이나 유사한 웹 기술을 택했습니다. 개발자 입장에서는 더할 나위 없이 편리한 선택지였던 거죠. 제 생각엔 이 흐름을 거스를 수 없었을 것 같아요. 그런데 말입니다, 개발자의 이런 편리함이 과연 사용자에게도 좋은 방향이었을까요?</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/xzLDp/dJMcahQvCSH/91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FxzLDp%2FdJMcahQvCSH%2F91QeSVgMBxHhVbBW9lSH2K%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"개발자의 효율적인 웹 기술 사용과 그로 인해 고통받는 사용자의 모습을 대비하여 보여주는 이미지.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  사용자가 지불하는 '성능 세금': 앱이 무거워지는 이유</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">아쉽게도, 개발자 편의성의 대가는 고스란히 사용자에게 '성능 세금'으로 부과되었습니다. Electron 앱은 기본적으로 자기만의 브라우저를 통째로 품고 있습니다. 여러 Electron 앱을 동시에 실행하면, 마치 여러 개의 크롬 브라우저를 띄워 놓은 것처럼 수많은 Chromium 인스턴스가 여러분의 PC 메모리를 점령하게 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 한두 개만 켜도 RAM 사용량이 확 오르더라고요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">고성능 PC를 사용한다면 체감하기 어려울 수도 있지만, 보급형 노트북이나 오래된 컴퓨터에서는 그야말로 끔찍한 성능 저하를 경험하게 됩니다. 앱 실행 속도는 현저히 느려지고, UI 요소들이 네이티브 앱처럼 부드럽게 작동하지 않거나 시스템 테마와 동떨어지는 경우도 흔합니다. 키보드 단축키도 제멋대로인 경우가 있고요. 게다가 이렇게 여러 브라우저가 메모리에 상주하고 있으면 노트북 배터리 수명에도 치명적일 수밖에 없습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">물론 모든 Electron 앱이 나쁘다는 건 아닙니다. 대표적인 예시가 바로 Visual Studio Code(VS Code)죠. VS Code는 Electron 기반임에도 불구하고 뛰어난 성능과 놀라운 최적화를 보여주는, 최고의 코드 편집기 중 하나입니다. 이 사례를 보면 Electron 자체가 문제가 아니라, 개발 과정에서 <b>최적화에 대한 '관심'과 '노력'이 줄어들기 쉬운 환경이 조성되었다</b>는 점이 더 큰 문제라고 생각해요. 편리함 뒤에 숨겨진 책임감의 부재랄까요?</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #d32f2f; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">⚠️ <b>주의!</b> 저사양 PC나 오래된 노트북 사용자라면 웹 기반 앱의 성능 저하를 더욱 크게 체감할 수 있습니다. 수많은 백그라운드 프로세스가 시스템 리소스를 잠식하고, 이는 느려진 반응 속도와 급격한 배터리 소모로 이어질 수 있어요.</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  마이크로소프트도 이 변화를 부추기고 있나?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 흐름에 마이크로소프트 역시 크게 제동을 걸지 않았다는 점도 주목할 만합니다. 아니, 어쩌면 마이크로소프트 자체가 이러한 변화를 은연중에 부추기고 있는지도 모릅니다. Edge 브라우저의 엔진을 앱에 내장할 수 있는 WebView2 같은 기술을 제공하고 있고, 마이크로소프트 스토어에는 이미 웹 기반 Electron 앱들이 차고 넘치죠. 심지어 마이크로소프트의 자체 제품인 Teams나 Office의 일부 요소들도 웹 기술에 크게 의존하고 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">엎친 데 덮친 격으로, 전통적인 윈도우 UI 프레임워크들은 시간이 갈수록 파편화되고 혼란스러워지고 있습니다. Win32, WPF, UWP, WinUI 3, 그리고 MAUI까지, 끊임없이 새로운 프레임워크가 등장하고 바뀌면서 소규모 개발자들이나 인디 개발자들이 윈도우 전용 코드베이스를 유지하는 것이 거의 불가능에 가까워졌어요.

        "contentSnippet": "과거의 윈도우 앱들은 놀랍도록 가볍고 빠르게 작동하며 사용자들에게 쾌적한 경험을 선사했습니다. 하지만 현재, 우리는 점점 무거워지고 느려지는 앱들에 익숙해지고 있죠. 개발 편의성이라는 명분 뒤에 숨겨진 사용자 경험의 희생, 그리고 '네이티브 앱'이라는 단어가 잊혀져 가는 현실 속에서 과연 어떤 변화가 있었는지 함께 자세히 살펴보겠습니다.\n\n\n✨ 과거의 영광, '네이티브 앱'은 무엇이었을까?\n윈도우에서 '네이티브 앱'이라고 하면, 그 운영체제 자체의 언어와 프레임워크를 기반으로 만들어진 애플리케이션을 의미했어요. Win32, MFC, .NET(WPF, WinForms) 같은 기술들, 그리고 좀 더 최근에는 UWP(Universal Windows Platform)나 WinUI 같은 것들이 대표적이죠. 이 앱들은 운영체제의 '모국어'를 구사하기 때문에 시스템 자원을 가장 효율적으로 사용하고, OS의 디자인 가이드라인이나 사용자 경험(UX)을 충실히 따랐습니다.\n그래서 과거의 많은 윈도우 앱들은 정말이지 상상할 수 없을 정도로 빠르고 가벼웠습니다. Notepad++, Winamp, Paint.NET, foobar2000, Everything Search 같은 이름들을 들어보시면 아마 고개를 끄덕이실 거예요. 용량도 몇 MB에 불과한데, 실행은 눈 깜짝할 사이에 되고, RAM도 거의 사용하지 않았죠. 솔직히 저도 가끔 이런 앱들을 쓰면서 '아, 옛날 앱이 짱이지!' 하고 감탄할 때가 많아요. 구형 컴퓨터에서도 전혀 버벅거림 없이 잘 돌아가는 걸 보면, 정말이지 최적화의 극치를 보여줬다고 생각합니다.\n  네이티브 앱이란? 운영체제 고유의 프레임워크를 사용하여 개발되어, OS의 기능과 자원을 가장 효율적으로 활용하는 애플리케이션을 의미합니다. 마치 그 운영체제만을 위해 태어난 것처럼, OS와 완벽하게 조화를 이루는 것이 특징이죠.\n  웹 기술 만능주의, 개발자들의 선택 'Electron'\n그런데 어느 순간부터 '네이티브 앱'이라는 단어는 점점 희미해지기 시작했습니다. 그 자리를 채운 것은 다름 아닌 웹 기술을 기반으로 한 앱들이었죠. 특히 Electron이나 PWA(Progressive Web Apps) 같은 기술들이 대세로 떠오르면서, 개발자들은 윈도우, macOS, 리눅스 등 각기 다른 운영체제별로 앱을 따로 만들 필요가 없어졌습니다.\n이게 왜 그렇게 매력적이었냐면, 한 번 HTML, CSS, JavaScript로 웹 앱을 만들면 Electron이 이 웹 앱을 마치 데스크톱 애플리케이션처럼 실행시켜 주기 때문이에요. Electron은 Chromium 브라우저 엔진과 Node.js 런타임을 통째로 앱에 포함시키는 방식인데, 덕분에 개발자들은 하나의 코드베이스만 관리하면 됩니다. 개발팀에 웹 개발자만 있어도 모든 플랫폼용 앱을 만들 수 있게 된 거죠. 반복 작업도 줄어들고, UI 변경도 훨씬 쉽습니다. 기존에 수많은 웹 라이브러리가 있다는 것도 엄청난 장점이고요.\n이런 장점들 덕분에 Slack, Discord, Figma의 데스크톱 클라이언트, Obsidian, Notion, 그리고 최근의 WhatsApp까지, 수많은 유명 앱들이 Electron이나 유사한 웹 기술을 택했습니다. 개발자 입장에서는 더할 나위 없이 편리한 선택지였던 거죠. 제 생각엔 이 흐름을 거스를 수 없었을 것 같아요. 그런데 말입니다, 개발자의 이런 편리함이 과연 사용자에게도 좋은 방향이었을까요?\n\n\n  사용자가 지불하는 '성능 세금': 앱이 무거워지는 이유\n아쉽게도, 개발자 편의성의 대가는 고스란히 사용자에게 '성능 세금'으로 부과되었습니다. Electron 앱은 기본적으로 자기만의 브라우저를 통째로 품고 있습니다. 여러 Electron 앱을 동시에 실행하면, 마치 여러 개의 크롬 브라우저를 띄워 놓은 것처럼 수많은 Chromium 인스턴스가 여러분의 PC 메모리를 점령하게 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 한두 개만 켜도 RAM 사용량이 확 오르더라고요.\n고성능 PC를 사용한다면 체감하기 어려울 수도 있지만, 보급형 노트북이나 오래된 컴퓨터에서는 그야말로 끔찍한 성능 저하를 경험하게 됩니다. 앱 실행 속도는 현저히 느려지고, UI 요소들이 네이티브 앱처럼 부드럽게 작동하지 않거나 시스템 테마와 동떨어지는 경우도 흔합니다. 키보드 단축키도 제멋대로인 경우가 있고요. 게다가 이렇게 여러 브라우저가 메모리에 상주하고 있으면 노트북 배터리 수명에도 치명적일 수밖에 없습니다.\n물론 모든 Electron 앱이 나쁘다는 건 아닙니다. 대표적인 예시가 바로 Visual Studio Code(VS Code)죠. VS Code는 Electron 기반임에도 불구하고 뛰어난 성능과 놀라운 최적화를 보여주는, 최고의 코드 편집기 중 하나입니다. 이 사례를 보면 Electron 자체가 문제가 아니라, 개발 과정에서 최적화에 대한 '관심'과 '노력'이 줄어들기 쉬운 환경이 조성되었다는 점이 더 큰 문제라고 생각해요. 편리함 뒤에 숨겨진 책임감의 부재랄까요?\n⚠️ 주의! 저사양 PC나 오래된 노트북 사용자라면 웹 기반 앱의 성능 저하를 더욱 크게 체감할 수 있습니다. 수많은 백그라운드 프로세스가 시스템 리소스를 잠식하고, 이는 느려진 반응 속도와 급격한 배터리 소모로 이어질 수 있어요.\n  마이크로소프트도 이 변화를 부추기고 있나?\n이런 흐름에 마이크로소프트 역시 크게 제동을 걸지 않았다는 점도 주목할 만합니다. 아니, 어쩌면 마이크로소프트 자체가 이러한 변화를 은연중에 부추기고 있는지도 모릅니다. Edge 브라우저의 엔진을 앱에 내장할 수 있는 WebView2 같은 기술을 제공하고 있고, 마이크로소프트 스토어에는 이미 웹 기반 Electron 앱들이 차고 넘치죠. 심지어 마이크로소프트의 자체 제품인 Teams나 Office의 일부 요소들도 웹 기술에 크게 의존하고 있습니다.\n엎친 데 덮친 격으로, 전통적인 윈도우 UI 프레임워크들은 시간이 갈수록 파편화되고 혼란스러워지고 있습니다. Win32, WPF, UWP, WinUI 3, 그리고 MAUI까지, 끊임없이 새로운 프레임워크가 등장하고 바뀌면서 소규모 개발자들이나 인디 개발자들이 윈도우 전용 코드베이스를 유지하는 것이 거의 불가능에 가까워졌어요. '내가 이미 React를 아는데, 굳이 XAML과 씨름할 필요가 있을까?' 하고 생각하는 게 어쩌면 당연한 일입니다.\n게다가 스토어에서 Electron 앱도 잘 받아주는데, 굳이 고생해서 네이티브 도구를 만들 이유가 없어지는 거죠. 과거 네이티브 윈도우 앱들은 셸 확장, 전역 단축키, 파일 연결, 드래그 앤 드롭, 알림 시스템, 심지어 작업 표시줄 통합 같은 시스템 기능들과 정말 유기적으로 연결되어 있었습니다. 이런 섬세한 통합성은 점점 더 획일화되는 웹 UI에서는 재현하기 어렵습니다. 잘 만들어진 네이티브 앱과 웹 기반 앱을 비교해 보면, 특히 저사양 하드웨어에서는 성능 차이가 극명하게 드러나는 걸 알 수 있어요.\n\n\n  그럼에도 불구하고, '진정한' 네이티브 앱은 살아있다!\n그럼에도 불구하고, 다행히도 여전히 훌륭한 네이티브 윈도우 앱들이 꾸준히 개발되고 유지되고 있습니다. Everything Search, ShareX, AutoHotKey, EarTrumpet 같은 도구들은 현대적인 네이티브 소프트웨어도 얼마든지 빠르고, 특정 기능에 집중하며, 운영체제에 완벽하게 통합될 수 있다는 살아있는 증거죠. 저도 이런 앱들을 써볼 때마다 '아, 이게 진짜 윈도우 앱이지!' 하고 무릎을 탁 치곤 합니다.\n이런 앱들은 불필요한 기능 없이 핵심적인 역할에 충실하며, 시스템 리소스를 최소한으로 사용합니다. 덕분에 아무리 오래된 PC에서도 쾌적하게 작동하죠. 이들이 보여주는 성능과 완성도는 웹 기반 앱들이 쉽게 따라올 수 없는, 네이티브 앱만의 고유한 강점이라고 생각합니다. 여전히 이런 노력을 기울이는 개발자분들께 정말 감사드리고 싶어요.\n  핵심 요약\n1. 과거의 네이티브 앱은 OS와 긴밀히 연동되어 놀라운 성능과 효율을 자랑했습니다.\n2.

미드저니(Midjourney)나 스테이블 디퓨전(Stable Diffusion) 같은 이미지 생성 AI들은 놀라운 예술 작품을 만들어내지만, 썸네일 제작에는 치명적인 단점이 하나 있었습니다. 바로 <b>'글자(Text)'를 정확하게 써내지 못한다는 점</b>이에요. 썸네일의 핵심은 시선을 끄는 이미지와 함께 명확한 메시지를 전달하는 카피라이팅인데, AI가 꼬불꼬불한 외계어만 그려 놓으니 결국 사용자가 포토샵으로 다시 텍스트 작업을 해야 하는 번거로움이 있었죠. 아, 정말 번거로웠어요!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이 근본적인 문제를 해결했습니다.</b> 이 앱에는 <b>구글의 최신 모델인 'Gemini Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)'가 탑재</b>되어 있어요. 이 모델은 단순히 그림을 잘 그리는 것을 넘어, <b>이미지 내에 정확한 텍스트를 렌더링하는 혁신적인 능력</b>을 갖췄습니다. 그리고 놀랍게도, 단순한 이미지 생성을 넘어 사용자의 의도를 파악하고 '기획(Strategy)'까지 할 수 있는 지능적인 AI로 진화했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발팀은 \"디자이너의 뇌(Brain)와 손(Hand)을 합치자\"는 목표로, 썸네일 기획부터 제작, 그리고 최종 보정까지 전 과정을 자동화하기 위해 이 앱을 만들었다고 해요. 2025년 현재, 이런 기능을 가진 AI는 정말 드물다고 생각합니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #8e44ad, #6200ea); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>'썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'의 핵심 기능들 ✨</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이제 여러분만의 <b>'수석 아트 디렉터'</b>가 되어줄 거예요. 마치 전담 디자이너를 둔 것처럼 든든하겠죠?

        "contentSnippet": "유튜브 영상의 성공은 단 1초, 썸네일에서 결정됩니다. 아무리 좋은 콘텐츠라도 클릭받지 못하면 빛을 볼 수 없죠. 디자이너 고용 비용, 직접 디자인하는 감각의 한계… 이 모든 고민을 단숨에 해결해 줄 혁신적인 AI 앱, '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'가 드디어 등장했습니다. 이제 여러분의 유튜브 채널도 30초 만에 떡상 시킬 수 있습니다!\n썸네일, 왜 그렇게 중요한가요?  \n\n\n\"내 영상은 왜 클릭이 안 될까?\" 유튜브 크리에이터라면 한 번쯤은 해봤을 고민일 거예요. 정말 정성 들여 만든 영상인데, 막상 업로드하고 나면 조회수가 기대에 못 미쳐서 실망했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 겁니다. 사실 유튜브 알고리즘의 핵심은 단순합니다. 바로 CTR(클릭률)이죠. 클릭이 많이 발생해야 알고리즘이 \"어, 이 영상 인기 있네?\"라고 판단하고 더 많은 사람들에게 노출시켜 주기 때문이에요.\n그런데 이 '클릭을 부르는 썸네일'을 만드는 게 생각보다 쉽지 않습니다. 단순한 그림 그리기나 예쁜 이미지 넣기가 아니거든요. 썸네일 속에는 사람의 시선을 사로잡는 고도의 심리학과 디자인 법칙이 숨어 있답니다. 예를 들어, 전 세계적으로 유명한 유튜버 MrBeast를 보면 그의 썸네일에는 몇 가지 일관된 특징이 있어요. 바로 고대비 색상, 과장된 표정, 그리고 3단어 이하의 짧고 강렬한 텍스트입니다. 이런 요소들이 시청자들의 호기심을 자극하고 클릭으로 이어진다는 거죠.\n  팁: 타겟 오디언스별 썸네일 전략\n썸네일 디자인은 타겟 오디언스에 따라 달라져야 합니다. 10대들은 도파민을 자극하는 화려하고 역동적인 이미지에 반응하지만, 시니어 층은 크고 명확한 글씨와 편안한 색감에 더 끌리죠.\n이처럼 성공하는 썸네일에는 명확한 공식이 존재합니다. 하지만 이 공식을 매번 직접 연구하고 디자인에 적용하기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니죠. 디자이너를 고용하자니 비용이 만만치 않고, 직접 포토샵을 켜자니 디자인 감각이 부족하다고 느끼는 분들이 많을 겁니다. 바로 이런 분들을 위해 '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'가 탄생했어요. 이 앱은 단순한 그림 도구가 아닙니다. '성공하는 썸네일 공식'을 완벽하게 학습한 AI가 기획부터 디자인까지 모든 과정을 원스톱으로 처리해 줍니다. 이제 디자이너에게 매번 의뢰비를 주는 대신, AI와 함께 커피 한 잔 값도 안 되는 비용으로 무한대의 썸네일 시안을 뽑아볼 수 있게 된 거죠. 정말 매력적이지 않나요?\n기존 AI의 한계를 넘어서: 탄생 배경  \n\"기존 AI 그림 도구들은 왜 썸네일을 제대로 못 만들까?\" 이런 의문을 가져본 적 없으신가요? 미드저니(Midjourney)나 스테이블 디퓨전(Stable Diffusion) 같은 이미지 생성 AI들은 놀라운 예술 작품을 만들어내지만, 썸네일 제작에는 치명적인 단점이 하나 있었습니다. 바로 '글자(Text)'를 정확하게 써내지 못한다는 점이에요. 썸네일의 핵심은 시선을 끄는 이미지와 함께 명확한 메시지를 전달하는 카피라이팅인데, AI가 꼬불꼬불한 외계어만 그려 놓으니 결국 사용자가 포토샵으로 다시 텍스트 작업을 해야 하는 번거로움이 있었죠. 아, 정말 번거로웠어요!\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이 근본적인 문제를 해결했습니다. 이 앱에는 구글의 최신 모델인 'Gemini Nano Banana Pro (Gemini 3 Pro)'가 탑재되어 있어요. 이 모델은 단순히 그림을 잘 그리는 것을 넘어, 이미지 내에 정확한 텍스트를 렌더링하는 혁신적인 능력을 갖췄습니다. 그리고 놀랍게도, 단순한 이미지 생성을 넘어 사용자의 의도를 파악하고 '기획(Strategy)'까지 할 수 있는 지능적인 AI로 진화했습니다.\n개발팀은 \"디자이너의 뇌(Brain)와 손(Hand)을 합치자\"는 목표로, 썸네일 기획부터 제작, 그리고 최종 보정까지 전 과정을 자동화하기 위해 이 앱을 만들었다고 해요. 2025년 현재, 이런 기능을 가진 AI는 정말 드물다고 생각합니다.\n'썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'의 핵심 기능들 ✨\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 이제 여러분만의 '수석 아트 디렉터'가 되어줄 거예요. 마치 전담 디자이너를 둔 것처럼 든든하겠죠? 어떤 놀라운 기능들이 있는지 자세히 살펴볼까요?\n\n\n\n이중 전략 제안 (Dual Track Strategy): AI가 하나의 정답만을 강요하지 않습니다. 시청자의 시선을 끄는 방식에도 여러 가지가 있다는 것을 아니까요. Option A(직관/팩트형)와 Option B(호기심/어그로형) 두 가지 전략을 동시에 제안하여, 크리에이터가 영상의 성격과 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 최적의 썸네일을 선택할 수 있도록 폭넓은 선택지를 제공합니다.\n타겟 오디언스 분석: 10대, 2040 직장인, 5060 시니어 등 영상의 타겟층을 설정하면, AI가 해당 오디언스가 선호하는 폰트 크기, 색상 대비, 디자인 스타일을 자동으로 적용해줍니다. 이 기능은 정말 핵심적이에요. 아무리 잘 만들어도 타겟이 외면하면 소용없으니까요!\n완벽한 텍스트 렌더링: 기존 AI의 가장 큰 단점이었던 '글자' 문제를 완벽하게 해결했습니다. 별도의 편집 툴 없이, 이미지 생성 시점에 썸네일 문구가 완벽하게 합성되어 나옵니다. 이제 꼬불꼬불한 외계어와는 작별입니다!\n일관된 캐릭터 유지: 채널의 개성을 살리는 데 중요한 요소 중 하나가 바로 일관성입니다. 성별, 나이, 인종 등 페르소나를 설정하면, AI가 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 고정 캐릭터를 썸네일에 계속 유지해 줍니다. 얼굴 없는 채널이라면 물론 이 부분은 건너뛸 수 있고요.\n썸네일 마스터 AI Pro, 100% 활용 가이드  \n전문적인 지식이 없어도 괜찮아요. 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 누구나 쉽게 사용할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 제가 직접 해보니, 정말 몇 번의 클릭만으로 전문가 수준의 썸네일을 만들 수 있더라고요. 자, 그럼 함께 사용법을 알아볼까요?\nSTEP 1. 주제 입력 및 대본 분석\n가장 먼저, 만들고 싶은 영상의 주제를 한 줄로 간단하게 입력하거나, 이미 작성된 영상 대본 파일(.txt)을 그대로 업로드해 보세요. AI가 대본 내용을 꼼꼼히 분석하여, 시청자의 클릭을 가장 강력하게 유도할 수 있는 핵심 키워드와 문구를 자동으로 추출해냅니다. 이 단계에서부터 AI의 기획력이 빛을 발한답니다.\nSTEP 2. 캐릭터 설정 (페르소나)\n내 채널의 주인공, 즉 페르소나를 설정하는 단계입니다. \"20대 한국인 여성 유튜버\", \"귀여운 고양이 캐릭터\", \"중년 남성 전문가\" 등 구체적으로 설정할수록 채널의 톤앤매너에 맞는 일관성 있고 매력적인 썸네일이 만들어집니다. 만약 얼굴 없는 채널을 운영하신다면 이 단계를 건너뛰어도 무방해요.\nSTEP 3. 타겟 오디언스 선택\n이 영상은 누가 보게 될까요? 타겟 오디언스를 명확히 설정하는 것은 매우 중요합니다.\n10대: 화려한 네온 효과, 강렬한 색상, 도파민을 터뜨리는 듯한 역동적인 스타일\n시니어: 검정 배경에 눈에 띄는 노란 글씨, 압도적인 가독성을 최우선으로 하는 디자인\n2040 직장인: 깔끔하고 세련된 디자인, 정보 전달에 효율적인 레이아웃 등\n타겟에 맞춰 썸네일 스타일을 자동으로 최적화해주니, 클릭률 상승에 정말 큰 도움이 됩니다.\nSTEP 4. 전략 확인 및 생성\n이제 AI가 제안한 A안(직관/팩트형)과 B안(호기심/어그로형)의 카피라이팅과 대략적인 시안을 확인해 보세요. 마음에 드는 안이 있다면 '생성하기' 버튼을 한 번만 클릭하면 됩니다. 그러면 고화질 썸네일 2장이 동시에 만들어집니다. 채널의 브랜딩을 위해 테두리 스타일이나 채널명 워터마크도 쉽게 추가할 수 있어서 편리했어요.\n\n\n⚠️ 주의: AI가 제안하는 카피라이팅은 강력한 클릭 유도에 초점을 맞추지만, 채널의 톤앤매너와 영상 내용의 진정성을 해치지 않는 범위 내에서 신중하게 선택하는 것이 중요합니다. 너무 과도한 어그로는 장기적인 채널 성장에 독이 될 수도 있다는 점, 기억해 주세요!\nSTEP 5. 수정 및 다운로드\n혹시 결과물이 완벽하지 않다고 느껴지나요? 걱정 마세요! \"표정을 더 놀라게 해줘\", \"글씨 색을 빨간색으로 바꿔줘\"처럼 채팅하듯 자연어로 입력하면 부분 수정(Inpainting)이 가능합니다. AI가 사용자의 요청을 정확히 파악하고 반영해 주니, 마치 옆에 디자이너가 있는 것 같았어요. 최종적으로 만족스러운 이미지가 완성되면 JPG 파일로 즉시 다운로드하여 유튜브 스튜디오에 업로드하면 끝! 정말 간편하죠?\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 썸네일 기획부터 디자인까지 원스톱으로 처리합니다.\n2. 구글 Gemini 3 Pro 기반으로, 이미지 내 정확한 텍스트 렌더링이 가능해요.\n3. 타겟 오디언스별 맞춤 전략과 이중 전략 제안으로 최적의 썸네일을 찾아줍니다.\n4. 간편한 사용법과 AI 채팅 기반의 부분 수정으로 누구나 전문가처럼 활용할 수 있어요.\n이제 썸네일 걱정은 그만! 콘텐츠에만 집중할 시간입니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 썸네일 마스터 AI Pro는 무료인가요?\nA1: 현재 '썸네일 마스터 AI Pro'는 유료 구독 서비스로 운영되고 있습니다. 하지만 디자이너 고용 비용이나 기타 유료 이미지 툴 비용에 비하면 매우 합리적인 가격으로 책정되어 있으며, 무료 체험 기간을 제공하기도 합니다. 자세한 요금제는 공식 웹사이트에서 확인해 보세요.\nQ2: 모든 종류의 유튜브 채널에 적용 가능한가요?\nA2: 네, 엔터테인먼트, 교육, 브이로그, 정보성 채널 등 거의 모든 종류의 유튜브 채널에 적용 가능합니다.

        "contentSnippet": "좋은 제품을 어렵게 소싱했지만, '팔리는' 상세페이지 제작에 매번 발목 잡히셨나요? 이제 더 이상 디자인과 카피라이팅 때문에 밤샘 고민할 필요 없습니다. AI 기술의 발전은 쿠팡, 스마트스토어 셀러들에게 상세페이지 제작의 새로운 지평을 열어주었죠. 오늘 이 글에서는 사진 한 장만으로 전문 MD와 디자이너가 만든 듯한 고퀄리티 상세페이지를 1분 만에 완성해주는 마법 같은 AI 솔루션을 소개해 드립니다.\n\n\nAI가 생성한 고품질 상세페이지를 태블릿으로 확인하며 만족하는 셀러의 모습. 이커머스 작업 효율성을 보여주는 미래지향적 이미지.\n\"물건은 정말 좋은데, 상세페이지 만들 시간이 도저히 없어서….\" 아마 많은 초보 셀러와 1인 창업가분들이 입버릇처럼 하는 말이 아닐까 싶어요. 저도 과거에 이런 고민 때문에 밤잠을 설치던 기억이 납니다. 포토샵은 너무 어렵고, 그렇다고 외주를 맡기자니 건당 수십만 원에 달하는 비용이 정말 큰 부담으로 다가오죠.\n \n제품 사입부터 배송, 고객 응대까지 하루 24시간이 모자란데, 여기에 디자인과 카피라이팅까지 신경 쓰기란 정말 쉽지 않은 일이죠. 저도 겪어봐서 잘 압니다. 하지만 이커머스 시장에서 상세페이지는 단순한 정보 전달을 넘어, 고객의 구매를 유도하는 '영업사원'과도 같은 역할을 합니다. 잘 만들어진 상세페이지 하나가 매출을 좌우한다고 해도 과언이 아니에요.\n오늘 소개해 드릴 ShopGenie AI는 바로 이런 셀러분들의 깊은 고민에서 출발했습니다. 사진 한 장과 간단한 설명만 있으면, 마치 전문 MD가 기획하고 전문 디자이너가 작업한 것처럼 보이는 고퀄리티 상세페이지를 자동으로 만들어주는, 말 그대로 '마법 같은' 도구죠. 이제 시간과 비용 걱정 없이 오직 좋은 제품을 소싱하는 데만 집중할 수 있게 될 겁니다.\n  탄생 배경: \"누구나 1등 셀러가 될 수 있도록\"\n현재 이커머스 시장은 그야말로 전쟁터라고 해도 지나치지 않습니다. 매일같이 수많은 신제품과 새로운 셀러들이 쏟아져 나오죠. 아무리 좋은 제품이라도 고객의 눈길을 단번에 사로잡지 못하면, 그 제품은 결국 수많은 경쟁 제품 속에서 잊히고 맙니다. 대기업이야 전문 스튜디오 촬영에 비싼 카피라이터를 고용할 수 있지만, 소상공인에게는 사실상 불가능에 가까운 일이었죠. 솔직히 저도 늘 부러워만 했습니다.\n이런 현실 속에서 \"AI 기술을 활용해 누구나 '팔리는 페이지'를 만들 수 있다면 어떨까?\"라는 질문이 ShopGenie AI의 시작점이 되었습니다. 2025년 현재, 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 Gemini 2.5 Flash와 Gemini 3 Pro를 탑재하여, 텍스트 생성부터 고화질 이미지 렌더링까지 한 번에 해결하는 올인원 솔루션으로 진화했죠. 복잡한 디자인 툴을 배우거나 비싼 외주에 의존할 필요 없이, 클릭 몇 번으로 전문가 수준의 결과물을 얻는 것이 핵심 목표입니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n  왜 ShopGenie AI가 필요한가요?\n많은 셀러분들이 상세페이지 제작에 엄청난 시간과 비용을 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 외주 업체에 맡기면 건당 수만 원에서 수십만 원은 기본이고, 작은 수정 하나에도 며칠씩 소요되곤 했죠. 그런데 ShopGenie AI는 이 모든 과정을 획기적으로 바꿔놓았습니다. 왜 지금 당신에게 이 AI 솔루션이 절실한지, 구체적인 이유들을 살펴볼까요?\n\n\n\n✅ 비용과 시간의 획기적인 절약: 외주 비용 0원! 수정 대기 시간 0! ShopGenie AI는 단 1~2분 만에 상세페이지 하나를 뚝딱 만들어냅니다. 기존에 며칠씩 걸리던 작업을 점심시간에 잠깐 투자하는 것만으로도 충분하죠. 저도 처음엔 믿기지 않았어요.\n✅ '똥손'도 '금손'으로! 고퀄리티 이미지 생성: 비싼 스튜디오 촬영은 이제 옛말입니다. 핸드폰으로 대충 찍은 누끼 사진도 괜찮습니다. AI가 제품에 가장 잘 어울리는 조명, 배경, 그림자를 완벽하게 재구성하여 전문 스튜디오에서 촬영한 듯한 4K 고화질 연출컷으로 바꿔줍니다. 상세페이지의 퀄리티가 확 달라지는 것을 체감할 수 있을 겁니다.\n✅ 플랫폼별 맞춤 최적화: 쿠팡은 '세로형 스크롤', 네이버 스마트스토어는 '블로그형' 등 플랫폼마다 고객이 선호하고 검색 엔진이 좋아하는 상세페이지 양식이 제각각입니다. ShopGenie AI는 타겟 플랫폼을 선택하면 그 규정에 딱 맞는 구조와 이미지 개수(예: 쿠팡은 12장 이상, 네이버는 9장 이상)를 자동으로 맞춰줍니다. 번거롭게 수동으로 조절할 필요가 전혀 없는 거죠.\n\n\n  핵심 팁: 상세페이지는 단순한 제품 소개가 아니라, 고객의 '문제 해결'에 초점을 맞춰야 합니다. ShopGenie AI는 이런 고객 중심의 접근을 도와주는 강력한 도구라는 점을 잊지 마세요!\n✨ ShopGenie AI 개요: 단순한 툴을 넘어선 전략적 파트너\n간혹 ShopGenie AI를 단순한 이미지 생성기로 오해하는 분들이 있습니다. 하지만 저는 이 AI 솔루션을 '스마트한 팀원'이라고 부르고 싶어요. 기획자, 카피라이터, 디자이너의 역할을 동시에 수행하며 셀러의 비즈니스 성장을 돕는 올인원 도구이기 때문이죠. 특히 다음과 같은 기능들은 정말 인상 깊습니다.\n✒️ 전문 MD급 카피라이팅: 후킹 메시지는 기본이고, 고객의 문제점(Pain Point)을 날카롭게 지적하며 솔루션을 제시하는 논리적인 설득 구조, 스펙 설명, 그리고 자주 묻는 질문(FAQ)까지! 전문 MD가 쓴 듯한 완벽한 카피라이팅을 자동으로 완성해줍니다.\n ️ 다양한 장면 연출: 제품만 덩그러니 있는, 흔해 빠진 사진은 이제 그만! AI가 제품을 사용하는 실제 장면(Lifestyle), 특정 기능을 강조하는 클로즈업 컷(Close-up), 계절별 이벤트 배너 등을 자동으로 생성하여 고객의 상상력을 자극합니다.\n✍️ AI 매직 에디터: 이미지가 마음에 들지 않아도 걱정 마세요. 마치 친구에게 채팅하듯 \"배경을 고급 대리석으로 바꿔줘\", \"조명을 더 밝게 해줘\"라고 입력하면 이미지가 즉시 수정됩니다. 이 기능은 정말이지 저의 디자인 고민을 단숨에 해결해줬습니다.\n\n\n⚠️ 주의 사항: 아무리 AI가 뛰어나더라도, 제품의 핵심 가치와 타겟 고객을 명확히 이해하고 입력하는 것이 중요합니다. AI는 당신이 제공한 정보 위에서 최고의 결과물을 만들어낸다는 점을 기억하세요!\n⚙️ 사용법: 4단계로 끝내는 '팔리는' 상세페이지\n혹시 사용법이 복잡할까 봐 걱정되시나요? 저도 그랬는데, 막상 써보니 정말 놀라울 정도로 간단했습니다. 단 4단계만 거치면 전문가 수준의 상세페이지가 완성됩니다.\nSTEP 1. 정보 입력: 제품명, 가격, 간단한 특징을 입력하세요. 만약 제품 설명이 어렵다면 '정보 자동검색' 버튼을 눌러보세요. AI가 구글 검색을 통해 제품 정보를 찾아 자동으로 채워줍니다. 가지고 있는 PDF 설명서가 있다면 업로드만 해도 AI가 분석을 끝내주니, 이보다 더 편할 수는 없겠죠?\nSTEP 2. 사진 업로드 & 옵션 선택: 제품 사진(가능하면 누끼컷 권장)을 업로드하고, 판매할 플랫폼(쿠팡/스마트스토어)과 원하는 AI 모델(빠른 속도/고화질)을 선택합니다.\nSTEP 3. 생성하기: '상세페이지 생성하기' 버튼을 누르고 잠시만 기다리세요. AI가 제품을 심층적으로 분석하여 매력적인 문구와 고퀄리티 이미지를 마치 마법처럼 쏟아냅니다.\nSTEP 4. 편집 및 저장: 완성된 페이지를 미리보기로 확인하세요. 텍스트가 마음에 안 들면 \"조금 더 감성적으로 바꿔줘\"라고 요청하고, 이미지가 아쉽다면 매직 에디터로 수정하면 됩니다. 완벽하다면 '전체 저장(JPG)' 또는 '이미지 개별 다운로드(ZIP)'를 눌러 쇼핑몰에 바로 업로드하면 끝! 정말 쉽고 빠르죠?\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 상세페이지 제작 시간과 비용 획기적 절감: 몇 분 만에 전문가 수준의 페이지 완성, 외주 비용 제로.\n✅ '똥손'도 고퀄리티 이미지 생성: AI가 배경, 조명, 그림자까지 완벽 재구성하여 4K 연출컷 제공.\n✅ 플랫폼별 맞춤 최적화 기능: 쿠팡, 스마트스토어 등 플랫폼별 최적화된 구조와 이미지 개수 자동 설정.\n✅ 올인원 AI 솔루션: MD급 카피라이팅, 다양한 장면 연출, AI 매직 에디터로 수정까지 한 번에.\n이 4가지 핵심 가치는 당신의 이커머스 비즈니스를 한 단계 더 성장시킬 강력한 엔진이 될 것입니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: ShopGenie AI를 사용하면 정말 디자인을 몰라도 상세페이지를 만들 수 있나요?\nA1: 네, 물론입니다!

        "contentSnippet": "AI와의 소통 방식이 진화하고 있습니다. 영어 프롬프트도 좋지만, 마크다운 문법을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 정확하고 원하는 형식으로 답변하게 만들 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 효율적인 AI 활용을 위한 마크다운 프롬프트의 모든 것을 친근하고 실용적인 예시와 함께 알려드릴게요!\n  AI와 더 똑똑하게 대화하는 비법, 왜 마크다운일까요?\n\n\n  AI는 우리 일상과 업무에 깊숙이 스며들었어요. 다들 챗GPT 같은 인공지능 도구들과 한 번쯤은 대화해보셨을 텐데요. 그런데 혹시 이런 경험 없으신가요? 꽤 긴 프롬프트를 입력했는데, AI가 엉뚱한 방향으로 답변하거나, 아니면 제가 원하는 형식과는 전혀 다른 결과물을 내놓을 때 말이에요. 정말이지 답답할 때가 한두 번이 아니었죠. 제 경험상 처음엔 단순히 영어로 프롬프트를 길게, 자세하게 쓰면 되는 줄 알았어요. 하지만 시간이 지날수록 무언가 더 중요한 것이 있다는 걸 깨닫게 되더라고요.\n사실, AI와 효과적으로 소통하는 데에는 언어 선택만큼이나 '구조'가 중요해요. AI는 우리가 던지는 문장들을 분석해서 의미를 파악하지만, 그 의미가 어떤 '형식'으로 이루어져야 하는지는 명확히 알려주지 않으면 헤맬 때가 많거든요. 이때 빛을 발하는 것이 바로 마크다운 문법입니다. 마치 설계도면처럼 AI에게 정확한 구조를 제시해서, 우리가 원하는 대로 정보를 구성하고 답변하게 만드는 거죠.\n  마크다운, AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'인 이유\n제가 왜 마크다운을 AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'라고 부르는지 궁금하시죠? 몇 가지 핵심적인 이유가 있어요. 단순히 영어를 잘 쓰는 것을 넘어서, 마크다운을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 똑똑해지고, 여러분의 작업 효율은 비약적으로 상승합니다.\n명확한 구조 전달: 마크다운은 헤더, 목록, 코드 블록, 표 등 정해진 문법으로 텍스트의 구조를 명확하게 정의할 수 있어요. AI는 이 구조를 보고 여러분이 원하는 답변의 형태를 정확하게 파악하게 됩니다.\n정보 손실 최소화: 모호하거나 중의적인 표현을 줄이고, 정보의 계층을 분명히 함으로써 AI가 프롬프트를 오해할 가능성을 현저히 낮춥니다.\n일관된 출력: 한 번 마크다운 문법으로 형식을 지정해두면, AI는 항상 그 형식에 맞춰 답변을 생성합니다. 반복적인 작업을 할 때, 수동으로 편집하는 시간을 크게 절약할 수 있어요.\n효율적인 작업: 특히 보고서 초안, 코드 스니펫 요청, 자료 요약 등 구조화된 정보가 필요한 경우, 마크다운은 개발자, 작가, 기획자 등 모든 직군에서 생산성을 폭발적으로 높여줍니다.\n  팁: 마크다운은 복잡한 프로그래밍 언어가 아니에요! 몇 가지 규칙만 알면 누구나 쉽게 활용할 수 있답니다. HTML처럼 복잡한 태그를 외울 필요도 없어서 정말 간편하죠.\n  초보자도 쉽게 따라 하는 마크다운 프롬프트 작성법\n그럼 이제 실전으로 들어가 볼까요? 마크다운 문법, 생각보다 정말 쉬워요. 몇 가지만 기억하면 됩니다. 제가 가장 많이 사용하는 핵심 문법들을 소개해 드릴게요.\n1. 헤더 (제목)\n문서의 제목이나 소제목을 만들 때 사용해요. `#`의 개수로 크기를 조절합니다.\n# 대제목\n## 중제목\n### 소제목\n2. 목록 (리스트)\n순서가 없는 목록은 `-`나 `*`로, 순서 있는 목록은 숫자로 시작합니다. 들여쓰기로 하위 목록을 만들 수 있어요.\n- 첫 번째 항목\n* 두 번째 항목\n1. 순서 있는 첫 번째\n  2. 하위 항목\n3. 코드 블록\n코드나 특정 텍스트를 강조하고 싶을 때 사용해요. 백틱(`) 세 개로 감싸면 됩니다.\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, AI!\")\n```\n4. 굵게/기울게\n텍스트를 굵게 하려면 `**`로, 기울게 하려면 `*`로 감싸세요.\n**굵은 글씨** -> 굵은 글씨\n*기울인 글씨* -> 기울인 글씨\n5. 표 (Table)\n데이터를 구조적으로 표현하는 데 유용해요. 생각보다 어렵지 않습니다!\n문법\n설명\n예시\n\n\n\n\n#\n헤더(제목)\n# 메인 제목\n\n\n- / *\n순서 없는 목록\n- 항목 1\n\n\n1.\n순서 있는 목록\n1. 첫째\n\n\n```\n코드 블록\n```코드```\n\n\n** / *\n굵게 / 기울게\n**강조**\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의: 지나치게 복잡한 마크다운은 오히려 AI를 혼란스럽게 할 수 있어요. 핵심적인 구조 위주로 간단하게 사용하는 것이 중요합니다. 너무 많은 문법을 한 번에 쓰려고 하지 마세요!\n  실제 사례로 보는 마크다운 프롬프트의 위력\n이론만으로는 와닿지 않으실 수도 있어요. 그래서 제가 직접 AI에게 마크다운 문법을 활용해서 프롬프트를 작성해본 몇 가지 사례를 보여드릴까 해요. 정말 놀라울 정도로 결과물의 질이 달라지는 걸 체감하실 겁니다.\n사례 1: 보고서 초안 작성 요청\n단순히 \"AI 기술 동향에 대한 보고서 초안을 써줘\"라고 요청했을 때와, 아래처럼 마크다운으로 구조를 명확히 제시했을 때의 결과는 하늘과 땅 차이였습니다. AI는 제가 원하는 목차와 내용 구성을 정확히 파악하고 깔끔하게 작성해 주더라고요.\n# 2025년 AI 기술 동향 보고서 초안\n\n## 1. 서론: AI 기술의 현재와 미래\n\n## 2. 주요 기술 동향\n### 2.1. 생성형 AI의 발전\n### 2.2. 소형 LLM의 등장\n### 2.3. 멀티모달 AI의 확장\n\n## 3. 산업별 적용 사례\n### 3.1. 제조 산업\n### 3.2. 의료 산업\n### 3.3. 금융 산업\n\n## 4. 결론 및 제언\n사례 2: 아이디어 브레인스토밍\n새로운 웹사이트 디자인 아이디어를 얻고 싶을 때, 단순히 \"웹사이트 디자인 아이디어 줘\"라고 하는 대신, 다음과 같이 리스트 형태로 요청했어요. 그랬더니 AI가 각 카테고리별로 핵심 아이디어를 깔끔하게 정리해 줘서 아이디어 구체화에 엄청난 도움이 되었습니다.\n다음 주제에 대해 5가지 혁신적인 웹사이트 디자인 아이디어를 제안해주세요.\n\n- 사용자 경험 (UX) 측면\n- 시각적 디자인 (UI) 측면\n- 기술적 구현 측면\n- 마케팅 활용 측면\n- 지속 가능성 측면\n사례 3: 코드 설명 요청\n특정 코드에 대한 설명을 요청할 때도 마크다운은 정말 유용해요. 코드를 코드 블록으로 감싸서 전달하면, AI가 해당 코드를 정확히 인식하고 구문별 설명, 기능 요약 등을 체계적으로 제공해 줍니다. 개발자라면 이 기능이 얼마나 강력한지 바로 이해하실 거예요.\n\n\n다음 Python 코드를 설명해주세요.\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(n):\n        yield a\n        a, b = b, a + b\n\n# 예시 사용\nfor num in fibonacci(10):\n    print(num)\n```\n\n- 이 함수는 무엇을 하는 함수인가요?\n- 각 줄의 기능은 무엇인가요?\n- 제너레이터(yield)를 사용한 이유는 무엇인가요?\n✨ AI 시대, 마크다운은 선택이 아닌 필수\n생각해보면, 우리는 AI와 대화할 때 마치 사람과 대화하듯 편하게 접근하곤 해요. 물론 기본적인 대화는 그것만으로도 충분하죠. 하지만 좀 더 전문적이고, 구체적이며, 원하는 형식의 결과물을 얻고 싶다면? 마크다운 문법은 이제 선택이 아니라 필수적인 소통 도구라고 자신 있게 말씀드릴 수 있습니다.\n2025년 현재, AI 기술은 계속해서 발전하고 있지만, 우리의 '프롬프트' 역시 그만큼 진화해야 해요. 마크다운은 AI의 이해도를 높여주고, 우리의 생산성을 극대화하며, 궁극적으로는 AI를 더욱 강력한 파트너로 만들어 줄 겁니다. 여러분도 오늘부터 AI와 대화할 때 마크다운 문법을 적극적으로 활용해보세요! 분명히 새로운 AI 활용의 지평이 열릴 거예요.\n  핵심 요약\nAI와 효과적인 대화의 핵심은 '명확한 구조'입니다.\n마크다운은 AI가 정보를 정확히 이해하고 원하는 형식으로 출력하게 돕는 강력한 도구입니다.\n헤더, 리스트, 코드블록 등 몇 가지 기본 문법만 알아도 활용도가 엄청나요.\n단순한 영어 대화보다 훨씬 효율적이며, AI 작업의 질을 혁신적으로 높여줍니다.\nAI와의 소통, 이제 더 이상 감에 의존하지 마세요. 마크다운으로 스마트하게!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: 마크다운 문법을 꼭 사용해야 하나요?\nA: 필수는 아니지만, AI로부터 원하는 형식과 내용의 답변을 얻으려면 마크다운 사용을 강력히 추천해요. 특히 복잡하거나 구조화된 정보를 요청할 때 그 효과가 극대화됩니다.\nQ: 어떤 AI 모델에 마크다운 프롬프트가 잘 작동하나요?\nA: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 등 대부분의 주요 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)은 마크다운 문법을 잘 이해하고 처리하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 오히려 마크다운을 통해 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있어요.\nQ: 마크다운을 너무 많이 사용하면 AI가 혼란스러워하진 않을까요?\nA: 아니요, 오히려 명확한 구조를 제공하여 혼란을 줄여줍니다. 다만, 지나치게 복잡하거나 불필요한 문법을 남용하는 것은 피하는 것이 좋습니다. 핵심 정보를 전달하는 데 필요한 만큼만 활용하세요.\n\n    {\n      \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n      \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n      \"mainEntity\": [\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"마크다운 문법을 꼭 사용해야 하나요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"필수는 아니지만, AI로부터 원하는 형식과 내용의 답변을 얻으려면 마크다운 사용을 강력히 추천해요. 특히 복잡하거나 구조화된 정보를 요청할 때 그 효과가 극대화됩니다.\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"어떤 AI 모델에 마크다운 프롬프트가 잘 작동하나요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini 등 대부분의 주요 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)은 마크다운 문법을 잘 이해하고 처리하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 오히려 마크다운을 통해 더 나은 결과를 얻을 수 있어요.\"\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"@type\": \"Question\",\n          \"name\": \"마크다운을 너무 많이 사용하면 AI가 혼란스러워하진 않을까요?\",\n          \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n            \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n            \"text\": \"아니요, 오히려 명확한 구조를 제공하여 혼란을 줄여줍니다. 다만, 지나치게 복잡하거나 불필요한 문법을 남용하는 것은 피하는 것이 좋습니다. 핵심 정보를 전달하는 데 필요한 만큼만 활용하세요.\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나는 차가 없다. 미국 서부에서는 차가 없으면 이동하는 게 거의 불가능해서 미국 살 때는 정말 운전을 많이 했는데, 원래 운전하는 걸 싫어하고, 서울은 대중교통과 택시 인프라가 워낙 좋아서, 이제 대부분의 이동은 택시, 공유 킥보드, 그리고 대중교통으로 한다.\n타다 이동 서비스가 아마 2018년도 하반기에 출시됐는데, 나는 이 서비스가 나오자마자 이용했고, 지금도 거의 매일 이용하는, 아주 오래된 고객이다. 아마도 타다 고객리스트를 뽑아보면 이용 빈도 기준으로는 내가 상위 15% 안에 들어가지 않을까 생각한다. 타다가 처음 출시됐을 땐 정말 획기적이었다. 당시에 내가 한국 택시와 택시 기사들에 대해 불만이 상당히 많았고, 뭔가 새로운 이동 수단에 대한 갈망이 극에 다다랐을 때인데, 초기 타다 서비스는 이런 나의 모든 불만을 잠식하면서 내가 모빌리티 수단에 대해 원하는 모든 걸 제공 했다.\n더럽고 냄새나는 실내, 멀미 날 정도의 급출발과 급정차, 승차 거부, 안전벨트 미착용, 귀가 아플 정도의 아무말 대잔치 등이 당시 내가 택시를 탈 때마다 나를 짜증 나게 했던 불편함이었다. 내가 이런 부분에 대해서는 보통 이상으로 좀 까칠하고 예민하긴 하지만, 운전을 업으로 하는 분들이 고객의 안전에 대해 신경 쓰지 않고, 일반인보다 운전을 못 하는 건 문제가 있는 것이다. 이런 시기에 나타난 타다는 초반에는 나에게 감동을 주기까지 했다. 일반 택시보다 비쌌지만, 이 가격 차이에 대한 지불 의향이 나에게는 충분히 있었다.\n하지만, 타다 서비스가 시장에 나온 지 7년밖에 안 되는 현시점에서 나는 이제 타다를 그만 탈지 고민 중이다. 그동안 가격은 오히려 더 올랐는데 서비스는 정말 바닥으로 떨어져서 타다 넥스트의 경우 차만 크지, 일반 택시랑 똑같은 카테고리로 하락했다고 생각한다. 승차 이후 차 문이 열린 상태로 그냥 출발하고, 급출발과 급정차는 이제 너무 흔하고, 차량 내부도 냄새나고 지저분하여졌다. 굳이 돈을 더 많이 내고 계속 이용해야 할지 요새 좀 고민 중이다. 이제 타다에서 하차하자마자 ‘이 기사님 30일 동안 안 만나기’ 박스를 체크하는 것도 지쳤고, 정말로 이런 내 후기와 피드백이 서비스에 반영되는지도 잘 모르겠다.\n이제 전반적인 제품과 서비스로 돌아와 보자. 서비스의 품질을 지속적으로 유지하는 건 왜 이렇게 힘들까? 어떻게 하면 회사는 사용자가 많아지고 제품이 스케일 하면서 초반의 높은 품질을 계속 유지할 수 있을까?\n나도 제품을 만들어서 서비스를 운영하는 사람이 아니라서 잘 모르지만, 작게 시작했는데 이제 국민 브랜드가 된 우리 투자사의 성장 과정을 옆에서 봤던 경험을 잘 복기해보면, 대략 다음과 같은 포인트들이 중요하지 않을까 생각한다.\n일단 전사적인 개밥먹기를 매일 해야 한다. 내가 초반에 타다의 예찬론자가 됐던 이유도 아마 이 회사의 창업가분들과 초기 멤버분들이 매일 직접 서비스를 이용하면서 관리했기 때문일 것이다. 이건 타다뿐만이 아니라 모든 제품과 서비스에 동일하게 볼 수 있는 현상이다. 초반에는, 이 제품을 직접 만든 분들이 매일 사용하면서 불편한 점들을 직접 개선하기 때문에 시장의 만족도가 매우 높다. 하지만, 돈이 벌리기 시작하고, 고객들이 많아지고, 조직의 규모가 커지면서 모두 바빠지면서, 본인들이 만드는 서비스를 직접 사용해 보는 이 개밥 먹기 문화는 점차 없어지거나, 일부 조직원들만 하게 된다. 이러면서 현장으로부터 멀어지고, 서비스는 망가지는 것이다. 전 직원들, 특히 임원들이 본인들이 만드는 서비스를 매일 사용하면 품질이 웬만하면 떨어질 수가 없다.\n계속 타다 이야기만 해서 좀 미안하긴 하지만,,,요샌 탈 때마다 차량의 청결 상태, 기사의 손님 응대 태도, 운전의 안전 기준 등이 너무 차이가 난다. 초반에는 모든 차가 깨끗했고, 기사의 태도도 비슷했고, 타면 항상 물어보는 표준 질문들이 있었는데, 이제 이런 게 잘 안 지켜지면서 표준 운용 절차라는 게 없어진 것 같다. 내 기억으론 서비스 시작 초반에는 모든 타다 기사가 표준 운영 매뉴얼을 숙지하고, 누가, 언제, 어디서 타더라도 항상 동일한 품질의 탑승을 경험할 수 있었다. 본인들이 운영하는 서비스의 품질을 계속 유지하고 싶다면, 고객들에게 항상 같은 경험을 제공하는 아주 명확하고 구체적인, 문서화된 표준 운영 절차가 있어야 한다. 그리고 전 직원이 이 운영 절차를 숙지해야 한다.\n그리고 마지막으로, 고객들의 피드백과 리뷰를 적극적으로 수집하고, 이를 실제 서비스에 거의 실시간으로 반영해야 한다. 솔직히 타다를 비롯해 내가 사용하는 많은 제품과 서비스들이 시장과 고객의 피드백을 제품에 반영하는지 잘 모르겠다. 카카오 택시도 이 중 하나인데, 나는 지금까지 카카오로 호출한 블랙 외의 다른 택시가 맘에 들었던 적이 단 한 번도 없었고, 운행이 끝나자마자 적극적인 후기를 수십 번 제출했는데, 이게 반영이 되는지 잘 모르겠다. 타다가 요새 이 내리막길을 가고 있는 것 같아서 매우 안타깝다.\n이 중 가장 중요한 건 본인이 만드는 제품과 서비스를 하루 종일 사용하는 것이라고 생각한다. 그러면 서비스가 아무리 커져도, 품질이 유지되지 않을 수가 없다. 대표가 이렇게 하는데도 품질 유지가 안 된다면, 정말 거지 같은 서비스를 만들고 있고, 회사에 정말 문제가 많다는 뜻이다.",
