        "pubDate": "Tue, 15 Jul 2025 18:00:13 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Microsoft C++ Code Analysis is a powerful static analysis tool integrated into Visual\nStudio that helps you identify and fix potential issues in your C++ code.\nLarge projects require effective management of analysis warnings to maintain code\nquality and you sometimes need to suppress warnings, but must do so in a clear and\nauditable way.\nTo that end, we are excited to announce significant updates to the warning suppression\nmechanisms in Microsoft C++ Code Analysis. These enhancements provide better tracking,\njustification, and overall management of warning suppressions, leading to a more\nmaintainable and robust codebase.\nWhat’s New in the SARIF Output?\nWe enhanced the\nStatic Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)\noutput to include detailed information about warning suppressions, most notably the\njustification provided by you. This allows teams to easily review why a specific\nwarning was silenced.\nTo generate a SARIF file, use the /analyze:log:format:sarif compiler option. To ensure\nthat details about suppressed warnings (including their justifications) are included in\nthis SARIF log, you must also use the /analyze:log:includesuppressed option.\nWhat’s New in gsl::suppress?\nWe have updated our support for gsl::suppress to align with the latest C++ Core\nGuidelines syntax. Warnings can now be suppressed by using the gsl::suppress attribute\nin the following way:\n[[gsl::suppress( \"<warning_id>\", justification: \"<justification>\" )]]\nWhere <warning_id> is the ID of the warning you want to suppress, and the optional\n<justification> is a string that provides a justification for the suppression.\nFor now, [[gsl::suppress]] is only available for C++ codebases. For C codebases, you\nmust use the #pragma warning(suppress) syntax.\nExample:\n// CoreCheckExample.cpp\r\n// Add CppCoreCheck package and enable code analysis in build for warnings.\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int arr[10];           // warning C26494\r\n    int* p = arr;          // warning C26485\r\n\r\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"bounds.1\", justification : \"This attribute suppresses Bounds rules #1\")]]\r\n    {\r\n        int* q = p + 1;    // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n        p = q++;           // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\nWhat’s New in #pragma warning?\nWe have extended #pragma warning to support the justification field. Here is how\nyou can use it starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14:\n#pragma warning(suppress : <warning_id>, justification : \"<justification>\")\nWhere <warning_id> is the ID of the warning you want to suppress, and the optional\n<justification> is a string that provides a justification for the suppression.\nChoosing Between #pragma warning and gsl::suppress\nBoth #pragma warning(suppress) and [[gsl::suppress]] offer fine-grained control over\nwarning suppression.\n#pragma warning(suppress) is a general MSVC mechanism that can be used for any\ncompiler warning. It’s particularly useful when you need to suppress a warning in a\nspecific code block without altering the code’s structure significantly.\n[[gsl::suppress]] will only suppress warnings emitted by Microsoft C++ Code\nAnalysis. It is intended for use with the C++ Core Guidelines checks and can be applied\nto a scope or a specific declaration.\nWhenever possible, we recommend using [[gsl::suppress]] for suppressing Microsoft C++\nCode Analysis warnings.\nWhy These Updates Matter\nThese enhancements to warning suppression offer several key benefits:\nImproved Auditability and Review: With justifications recorded directly in the\ncode and optionally in SARIF logs, code reviews become more effective. Team members can\nquickly understand the rationale behind a suppression without needing to consult\nexternal documentation or the original author.\nEnhanced Code Maintainability: Clear justifications prevent accidental\nre-introduction of issues when code is refactored or suppressions are reviewed. They\nprovide a history of why certain warnings were deemed acceptable at a particular point.\nBetter Management of Technical Debt: Suppressed warnings can be a form of\ntechnical debt. Justifications help in tracking and prioritizing which suppressions\nshould be revisited and potentially fixed.\nConsistency Across Suppression Mechanisms: By adding justification support to both\n#pragma warning and gsl::suppress, we provide a consistent experience for you. This\nallows old code to use #pragma warning while new code can use [[gsl::suppress]], all\nwhile maintaining the ability to provide justifications.\nImpact on Existing Workflows\nThese new features are additive. Existing suppression mechanisms (without\njustifications) will continue to work as before. However, we encourage you to\nstart using the justification attribute for new suppressions and to gradually update\nexisting ones where clarity is beneficial. There is no automatic migration, but the\nprocess of adding justifications is straightforward.\nAvailability\nThese enhancements are available in the MSVC compiler toolset shipping with Visual\nStudio 2022 version 17.14 and newer, and will be part of future Visual Studio releases.\nEnsure your Visual Studio is updated to leverage these improvements.\nTry It Out\n// example.cpp\r\n// Compile with: cl /analyze:only /analyze:plugin EspxEngine.dll /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed example.cpp\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int arr[10];           // warning C26494\r\n    int* p = arr;          // warning C26485\r\n\r\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"bounds.1\", justification : \"This attribute suppresses Bounds rules #1\")]]\r\n    {\r\n        int* q = p + 1;    // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n        p = q++;           // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\nYou can run the above code with the following options:\n/analyze /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed to generate a SARIF\nfile that includes the suppression details.\n(Note: EspxEngine.dll is the plugin that enables C++ Core Guidelines checks, which are\nthe target of gsl::suppress.)\n> cl /analyze:only /analyze:plugin EspxEngine.dll /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed .\\example.cpp\r\nMicrosoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.50.35305.95 for x64\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Meta has developed an open-source AI tool to design concrete mixes that are stronger, more sustainable, and ready to build with faster—speeding up construction while reducing environmental impact.\nThe AI tool leverages Bayesian optimization, powered by Meta’s BoTorch and Ax frameworks, and was developed with Amrize and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I) to accelerate the discovery of high-performance, low carbon concrete.\nMeta successfully deployed a concrete mix that was optimized with the AI tool at a data center construction site. Being open-sourced and freely available, the AI-tool could help increase the adoption and optimization of sustainable concrete mixes in the construction industry at large.\nLow carbon concrete solutions are essential for advancing our goal of net zero emissions in 2030. Concrete production is a major contributor to the embodied carbon emissions in data center construction and accounts for 8% of all global CO2 emissions, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nConventionally, concrete is optimized for strength (28-day compressive strength) and cost. But modern constructions – including data centers – require concrete that is optimized for sustainability, curing speed, workability, and finishability as well. \nInnovation in concrete formulations is difficult and slow. Compared to traditional concrete, current formulas for low carbon concrete face several challenges: slower curing speeds, issues with surface quality, and complications in supply chains when novel materials are involved.\nBut concrete suppliers can utilize AI to develop and scale innovative concrete mixes as drop-in replacements, accelerating the discovery and integration of sustainable materials for large-scale use.\nBy collaborating with Amrize — one of the world’s largest cement manufacturers and major concrete suppliers — and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I), we’ve developed an AI model and pipeline to accelerate the discovery of new concrete mixtures that meet traditional requirements alongside newer sustainability needs.\nOur work with Amrize and U of I has already resulted in the successful design and deployment of AI-designed green concrete at our new data center in Rosemount, MN. \nMeta’s AI model for green concrete\nDesigning concrete formulas is a complex, multi-objective problem. The designer must choose between various types and proportions of cement, lower-carbon supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), water-to-binder ratios, coarse and fine aggregate types, and admixtures. SCMs’ impact on concrete performance varies by source location and seasonality, requiring long-term tests for validation. Finally, time-consuming tests taking days and weeks are needed to fully validate the performance of new mixes. Thus, it is important for the design process to be as efficient as possible. \nThere are several key ingredients often used in a sustainable concrete mix: \nCement is the “glue” that holds concrete together. It’s made from calcining limestone, clay, and other minerals in a high-temperature rotary kiln – the process which contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. The cement is then mixed with water, SCMs, aggregates, and admixtures at a ready mix plant to create concrete. When the cement paste hydrates and stiffens over time, it forms a hard, binding gel that gives concrete its strength.\nSlag is a byproduct of steel production. It’s a molten waste material that’s cooled and ground into a fine powder. In concrete, slag helps reduce concrete’s embodied carbon by replacing cement, and improves long-term strength, durability, and resistance to external chemicals.\nFly ash is a type of industrial by-product from coal-fired power plants. It’s collected from the air pollution control systems and can be used as a substitute for some of the cement in concrete. Fly ash helps reduce the embodied carbon in concrete by replacing cement, and also improves its long-term strength, durability, and workability.\nFine aggregate, like sand, is smaller than coarse aggregate and fills in the gaps between the larger rocks or gravel. Sand helps to create a smooth, even surface, and improves the overall texture of the concrete.\nCoarse aggregate refers to crushed stone or gravel that are added to concrete to provide bulk volume and load-bearing capacity, helping the concrete resist cracking and shrinkage.\nMixing these ingredients together in different proportions gives rise to concrete with varying strength and sustainability properties. The properties of each ingredient varies by origin and condition of manufacturing. Furthermore, some of the SCMs are declining in availability, necessitating the discovery and incorporation of novel materials for which little-to-no data is available. All of this adds to the challenges of concrete design. The goal of our approach is to optimize the trade-off between strength and sustainability.\nSeveral key ingredients used to generate concrete mixes, clockwise from top left: fly ash, coarse aggregates, fine aggregate, and cement.\nAn example of a low carbon concrete mix design, showing the relative amount of ingredients by weight.\nTo accelerate the concrete mix design process, Meta developed an AI model for sustainable concrete using BoTorch and Ax, Meta’s open-source software for Bayesian optimization and adaptive experimentation, respectively. This model uses multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms to learn and optimize concrete compositions. The approach predicts compressive strength curves for different mixtures, optimizing short- and long-term strength properties and sustainability.\n(For technical details of the model and optimization algorithm, see our technical report, “Sustainable Concrete via Bayesian Optimization” and our open source SustainableConcrete repository with the associated data and code.)\nThe basis of the approach is a model that predicts the compressive strength curves associated with different concrete mixtures.\nThe figure below shows an example of two strength curve predictions, one associated with a concrete mix including pure portland cement (purple)—the most commonly used type of cement—and a second one where a part of the cement was substituted by fly ash (blue), whose carbon impact is lower than that of cement. We then leveraged the strength predictions at various times to jointly optimize the short- and long-term strength properties, as well as the sustainability of the associated mixes, to generate new formulas that can be validated through testing.\nBy using AI, we can accelerate the discovery process and drive efficiency in the experiment process.  \nTwo strength curve predictions carried out by our model during early development. The more sustainable mix (green) exhibits lower compressive strength early on but overtakes the traditional mix (blue) later on, a common trade-off of more sustainable concrete mixes.\nTo train this AI model with real data, we collaborated with Professor Nishant Garg and his research group at U of I. In each iteration, the AI suggests new promising concrete mixes based on performance predictions, which are updated with the latest data. We validated these predictions with lab testing and used the results to refine the AI for subsequent iterations. Our AI pipeline consists of the workflow of generating baseline data, training an AI model, using it to develop and validate new hypotheses, and then improving the baseline data and AI training.\nIn implementing the first AI pipeline, we focused on several key metrics: compressive strength, curing speed, slump, and sustainability, which we quantify using a proxy for the carbon footprint of the concrete mix. The compressive strength of concrete is crucial for determining both its long-term structural integrity, typically specified as its 28-day compressive strength, and its short-term curing speed, specified as the time needed to achieve certain strength requirements such as strength one, three, and five days after the pour. When densely sampled x-day strength data is available, a strength curve can be generated.\nThese attributes can be tested on concrete cylinders in the lab, allowing for rapid and systematic data generation necessary for training the AI. Larger-scale tests can be conducted after the new formulas, discovered through iterative testing, have been reviewed by concrete experts. By conducting research and development in stages, we can focus the AI on critical metrics and expedite progress.\nThe resulting AI pipeline is illustrated below:\nAdaptive experimentation steps to implement an AI pipeline.\nThe figure below shows how AI is able to learn and further optimize x-day strength versus sustainability (quantified using a proxy for the carbon footprint of the concrete mix) over several iterations, exceeding the initial human-designed formulas.\n\nOver time, this AI pipeline has generated high-quality data for AI training and development, containing over a hundred unique concrete mixes, comprehensive x-day compressive strength data, and global warming potential (GWP, measured in terms of kilograms of CO2 per cubic meter). \nDeveloping an AI pipeline for industrial green concrete\nIn 2024, we started collaborating with Amrize to explore how Meta’s AI can be used at scale in the concrete industry. \nAmrize shared basic concrete performance data, supporting Meta’s open source approach. They developed an AI pipeline at their batch plant near St. Paul, MN, extending the discovery and testing process.\nCritical to data centers are the concrete slabs that serve as surfaces for deploying servers and associated power and cooling equipment. Data center slabs to be flat, level, smooth, and durable to enable reliable servicing of the equipment that reside on it. Therefore, their concrete formulations must meet additional high-quality finish requirements. Our AI algorithms incorporate specific water-to-binder ratios and volumetric material constraints, and discover high-performing formulas with faster curing and lower GWP values that meet the stricter requirements.\nDistinguishing between formulas suitable for slabs, and those more suitable for other applications, we can compare their performance against industry standard formulas (see below). Within two iterations, and with minor human adjustments, the AI pipeline discovered formulas that exceeded standard low carbon industry formulas in terms of strength, speed, and sustainability.\nThe strength curves of standard industry low carbon formulas compared to AI-optimized formulas. AI-optimized formulas are faster, stronger, and have lower carbon emissions.\n\n\nApplying Amrize’s AI-designed concrete formulation at Meta’s Rosemount data center\nFurther testing is needed to apply AI-generated formulas in real-world applications. We therefore extended the first AI pipeline to incorporate additional steps and further tests, as shown in the figure below.\nAmrize collaborated with Mortensen, a general contractor responsible for the construction of our datacenter, to test the new formula’s workability and finishability. Successful slab tests led to at-scale application in a site support section in one of the data center building slabs at Meta’s Rosemount, MN data center project.\nThe development and scaling-up process to test and validate AI-generated concrete formulas. Human experts assess the outputs of each stage and iteration, refine the AI to incorporate additional constraints, and/or adjust individual constraints such as total binder amount and water-to-binder ratio.\nFormal tests show that the team exceeded all the technical requirements while achieving good workability and finish performance required for the application. \nClick to view slideshow.\nOpen source for more sustainable construction \nAt Meta, we believe AI can generate high-performance, low carbon concrete mixes for major construction projects such as data centers. Open source AI can benefit every level of the construction industry, from the construction companies and contractors, to suppliers, providers, architects, and, of course, building owners.\nWe will continue our collaboration with Amrize to further scale the use of AI in the concrete industry. The basic AI solution will remain open source to enable further commercial productization, application, and R&D. \nOur aim is to scale the use of low carbon concrete in data centers and encourage the adoption of performance-based requirements at minimum risk. Meta will continue to engage with other hyperscalers to collaboratively test and prove low carbon concrete formulas to further decrease carbon emissions. Meta will also leverage organizations such as iMasons and the Open Compute Project to publish reference designs, AI-informed formulas, case studies, and best practices.  \nLearn more about Meta’s AI for sustainable concrete\nDownload the sustainable concrete AI model on GitHub.\nRead our technical report, “Sustainable Concrete via Bayesian Optimization.”\nLearn more about BoTorch and Ax. \nRead more about how Meta uses low carbon concrete in our data centers.\nThe post Using AI to make lower-carbon, faster-curing concrete appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Android’s D8 tool, which converts bytecode to DEX  (Dalvik executable) format, only supports these backticked identifiers on Android 10 (API level 30) and newer.\n@Test\nfun `hello world returns 200`() = testApplication {\n    routing {\n        get(\"/hello\") {\n            call.respondText(\"Hello World!\")\n        }\n     }\n     val response = client.get(\"/hello\")\n     assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.status)\n}\nThis regression is fixed in Ktor 3.2.2. To prevent this from happening again, we’ve added new checks to our testing infrastructure. These tests continuously verify Ktor’s compatibility with essential Android tools, including D8 and ProGuard, ensuring new features don’t break support for older Android versions. More details can be found on YouTrack and on GitHub.\nMinor bug fixes and enhancements\nImprovements\nThymeleaf: The template model now accepts null values (KTOR-8559).\njavadoc now published as a Maven artifact (KTOR-3962).\nNetty: An invalid hex byte with a malformed query string now returns the expected 400 Bad Request error instead of a 500 Internal Server Error.  (KTOR-2934).\nIt automatically closes AutoCloseable instances or allows to configure your own cleanup handlers.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we care about Kotlin compiler quality. One powerful way to test it? Fuzzing, an approach that feeds programs unexpected, often random, inputs to uncover bugs that traditional tests may miss. It may sound chaotic, but it works, especially for complex software like compilers.\nIn a previous post, our colleagues introduced kotlinx.fuzz, a powerful tool for uncovering bugs in Kotlin programs.  As the Kotlin compiler is a Kotlin program, we can use fuzzing to test it, too.  In this post we will:\nExplain what fuzzing is and how it compares to traditional compiler testing techniques.\nShow how we applied it to the Kotlin compiler in collaboration with TU Delft.\nShare real bugs we caught and fixed, including in the new K2 compiler.\nCompiler fuzzing vs. traditional compiler testing techniques\nCompilers are essential to software development, as they transform the code we write into instructions that machines can read and then execute. Compilers are used not once, but multiple times throughout the whole software development stack. Without them you cannot compile your operating system kernel, your system library, or your JavaScript engine. Figure 1 points out where compilers are needed, underlining how crucial they are. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The importance of compilers in the software development stack.\nFigure 1 shows that compilers are not just an isolated development tool but are also needed to compile your source code in other places in the stack. This means that when something as important as a compiler contains bugs, it can cause bigger problems, such as:\nSecurity holes or vulnerabilities\nIncorrect code generation, subtly inconsistent with the original source code\nPerformance issues via mistriggered optimization\nCompiler crashes\nSo how do we ensure that compilers are free of errors? The rest of this section will outline some ways to detect bugs, starting with more traditional techniques and then moving on to fuzzing.\nUncovering bugs: Traditional techniques\nTraditional testing techniques focus on program behavior, namely, whether it produces correct output with valid input while properly handling any errors with invalid input. Table 1 lists some common methods.\n\nWhatHow\nUnit testsCheck individual components (e.g., lexer, parser, code generator)\nFunctional testsVerify that all compiler components behave as expected \nGold verification tests (regression tests)Compile a suite of known programs and compare compilation result to the expected output (i.e., gold standard)\nIntegration testsCheck whether compiler runs correctly with other tools or systems (e.g., build systems, linkers, or runtime environments)\nCross-platform testsTest compiler on different operating systems or platforms for consistency\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Traditional testing techniques.\nThese traditional techniques are essential for compiler development, but they may miss subtle bugs that only appear under specific circumstances. This is where advanced techniques like fuzzing can be more successful.\nFuzzing, or the art of breaking things to make them better\nAt its heart, fuzzing is based on a very simple idea: let’s throw a lot of random inputs at a program to see if it breaks. Long before fuzzing was adopted as a named technique, developers have been known to use a form of it. For example, programmers in the 1950s could test programs with a trash-deck technique: they input punch card decks from the trash or random-number punch cards to see when undesirable behavior might occur. \nWhile working on the Apple Macintosh in 1983, Steve Capps developed a tool to test MacWrite and MacPaint applications, which at the time were battling low memory conditions. Called The Monkey, it fed random events to an application and caused the computer (in this case, the Macintosh) to behave as if it were “operated by an incredibly fast, somewhat angry monkey, banging away at the mouse and keyboard, generating clicks and drags at random positions with wild abandon”. \nTo increase testing quality, Capps limited some random events, like menu commands, to a certain percentage, and later Bill Atkinson defined a system flag to disable commands such as quit, so the test could run as long as possible. Although the tool itself became obsolete when later Macintosh iterations freed up more memory, it is an important part of software testing history.\nThe term fuzzing is credited to Professor Barton Miller, who first experienced interference noise on a dial-up link when remotely logging into a Unix system during a storm in 1988. This noise caused the programs to crash, a surprise considering they were common Unix utilities. So that this effect could be explored more in depth, Miller then assigned his students a project to “evaluate the robustness of various Unix utility programs, given an unpredictable input stream”. One student group went on to publish a 1990 paper with Miller on their findings.\nFuzzing fundamentals\nIn contrast to carefully designed test cases like those in Table 1 above, fuzzing uses randomly generated inputs that can be unexpected or even deliberately nonsensical. The more diverse the inputs, the more likely the fuzzing tool (i.e., the fuzzer) will be to find unexpected issues.\nA fuzzer has three essential components: (i) an input data generator, which generates diverse inputs, (ii) the software under test (sometimes abbreviated as SUT), which processes these inputs, and (iii) a reference model, which produces the correct output from the same inputs. Both the software and the reference model produce outputs from the same inputs, and these outputs are compared to one another. Figure 2 depicts the relationship between the three components, the outputs to be compared, and the fuzzing result.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fuzzing basics.\nThe fuzzing result tells us whether or not the software performed correctly with the automatically generated input, as compared to the reference model with that same input. This process is repeated over and over, represented in the above image by multiple windows.  This repetition ensures that the inputs used for testing are sufficiently diverse. \nThe idea is to find inputs which cause the software to fail, either by crashing or producing incorrect results. It’s not so much about testing the intended functionality. That is, fuzzing investigates the edge cases of what the software can or cannot handle.\nCompiler fuzzing techniques\nSo far, we’ve covered the basic idea of fuzzing and a brief history of it. In this section, we will get more specific, starting with different ways to fuzz compilers.\nTwo fuzzing types that are more advanced are generative fuzzing, which constructs test programs from scratch based on grammar or specification of the target inputs, and mutation-based fuzzing, which starts with existing, valid, programs and modifies them to create new test inputs. Modifications (mutations) can include inserting, deleting, or replacing input parts. Table 2 lists pros and cons for each. \n\n\n\n\nTable 2: A comparison of generative and mutation-based fuzzing.\nFigure 3 further compares the two techniques to basic fuzzing, underlining their trade-offs on how well they cover different parts of the compiler vs. how deep they can explore it.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A comparison of fuzzing types.\nThis section has described fuzzing basics and how fuzzing is an effective method for ensuring a high standard in compiler quality. Going forward, we will focus on fuzzing the Kotlin compiler specifically.\nKotlin compiler fuzzing\nFuzzing is already a widespread practice for many programming languages, from C++ and JS to Java. At JetBrains, our Kotlin team is no stranger to fuzzing the Kotlin compiler. We have collaborated with external research groups to try to break the compiler with differing fuzzing approaches. One of the first collaborations gave us a great example of how to crash kotlinc using 8 characters and the main function. This is shown below.\nfun main() {\n    (when{}) // Crash in Kotlin 1.3, fixed in 1.5\n}\nYou can also access the example on Kotlin Playground in Kotlin 1.3 and Kotlin 1.5 versions, i.e., before and after the bug was fixed. The following code blocks contain two more examples of bugs found by fuzzing.\nfun <break> foo() // Compilation crash on type parameter named `break`\nfun box(){\n    foo()\n}\nThis example shows a compiler crash when it encounters a reserved identifier (such as break) in the position of a type parameter.\nfun box(): String {\n    return if (true) {\n        val a = 1 // No error when we are expected to return a `String`\n    } else {\n        \"fail:\"\n    }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    println(box())\n}\nThe above example shows a miscompilation of when the compiler failed to reject an incorrect program: the if expression should return a String, but the true branch does not return anything.\nFigure 4 displays an incomplete trophy list of found-by-fuzzer bugs, demonstrating fuzzing’s usefulness. Many of the reported bugs greatly helped us in the K2 compiler stabilization.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Incomplete trophy list of found-by-fuzzer bugs.\nEvolutionary generative fuzzing\nLast year, we collaborated with TU Delft’s SERG team to more rigorously explore the properties of generative fuzzing. In this 2024 paper, we looked at generative fuzzing as an evolutionary algorithm problem and developed a fuzzing approach: Evolutionary Generative Fuzzing. This subsection will describe our approach in more detail.\nFirst, let’s break down the term evolutionary generative fuzzing. As discussed above, generative fuzzing is a bottom-up approach to creating program inputs, generating them following a specific set of rules. In the present case, the generation rules are based on the language syntax, or the Kotlin grammar, and its semantics, or the Kotlin specification. \nThe term’s evolutionary part comes from evolutionary algorithms, an approach that simulates the real evolutionary process. Evolutionary algorithms and a common subtype, genetic algorithms, are optimization techniques that use natural selection and genetic inheritance principles for solving complex problems in programming. \nFirst we will talk about the basic concepts of a genetic algorithm, then we will apply these concepts to fuzzing. Essentially, these types of algorithms are meant to mimic the way living organisms evolve over generations to adapt and survive in their environments. Figure 5 depicts this cycle.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Genetic algorithm cycle.\nAs a problem-solving technique, a genetic algorithm starts with a specific problem, and for this problem there are multiple candidate solutions. Each solution represents an individual (sometimes called chromosome), which could be,  for example, a specific input for a function. A set of individuals represents a population, just like in the natural world. \nTo begin the algorithm, an initial population must be generated, typically a set of random individuals (i.e., candidate solutions). After the initial population is generated,  a fitness function evaluates the suitability of each individual within the population, only retaining those individuals most the most fit to move on to the next generation. Then, the set of fit individuals mutate and recombine to form a  new population. This new  combination of individuals make up the next generation’s population.\nLet’s apply this to our Kotlin compiler fuzzing approach, represented in the more specialized version of the evolutionary cycle in Figure 6. The lighter-colored and smaller rectangles attached to the larger ones represent the relevant action needed to reach each stage. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Genetic algorithm in the evolutionary generative fuzzing approach.\nTo begin, the individuals are Kotlin code snippets created with generative fuzzing. To create the initial population, we sample multiple code snippets, which are then evaluated by a fitness function. And to simulate reproduction, we split each snippet into code blocks, where each block represents an individual’s chromosome. These code-block chromosomes then mutate and recombine to create new code snippets, which are sampled to create the next generation’s population. An important takeaway of the approach is: \nThe evolutionary generative fuzzer is not purely generative: it is also partially mutation-based.\nAs mentioned above, a fitness function plays an integral part in the evolutionary cycle. In this work we hypothesized that structurally diverse code is more likely to exercise different compiler components than more uniform code; by stressing various compiler components, more bugs will be able to be uncovered. To test this, we investigated a baseline and two different ways to calculate the fitness function, with both being attempts to optimize the sampled code’s diversity.\nAs a baseline, our approach used what is called random search (RS), as it samples programs without any fitness function. We also used different measures of diversity realized through the fitness functions to apply two novel types of genetic algorithms (GAs): single-objective and many-objective functions for the single-objective diversity GA (SODGA) and many-objective diversity GA (MODGA), respectively. The details of these two genetic algorithms and the baseline are summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Approaches and their fitness-function details.\nThe generated code was then compiled with both the original K1 compiler and the new K2 compiler released with Kotlin 2.0. This allowed us to focus on K1-to-K2 changes and find situations when the new compiler introduces regressions or unexpected behavior changes.\nApplying any approach listed in Table 3 results in finding interesting bugs, and the different approaches complement each other in terms of bug-detecting categories: random search (RS in Table 3) is effective for detecting more straightforward differential bugs such as out-of-memory errors and resolution ambiguity, whereas the two genetic algorithms (SODGA and MODGA in Table 3) are successful in detecting nuanced problems such as with conflicting overloads, shown in the code example below.\nfun main() {\n    fun p(): Char { return 'c' }\n    fun p(): Float { return 13.0f }\n}\nThe intended behavior of the above code block is that the compiler reports a conflicting overloads error, as the two p functions should cause a resolution conflict. The K1 compiler returns the appropriate error, while the K2 compiles the code without any warning. By applying two types of genetic algorithms, we were able to uncover several independent instances of this bug, and we fixed this error in Kotlin 2.0.\nOverall, our team’s complex approach to Kotlin compiler fuzzing has led to the discovery of previously unknown bugs. In combining both generative and mutation-based fuzzing, we have been able to enhance bug discovery.\nThe future of fuzzing\nFuzzing has already enabled our team to find and fix many compiler bugs, improving the Kotlin compiler. Our research collaboration with TU Delft’s SERG team produced a more advanced approach to fuzzing, combining generative and mutation-based methods, and with this foundation we can fine tune fuzzing even more.\nFuzzing is an active field of research with many opportunities for advancement, and fuzzing a complex, industrial language like Kotlin presents unique challenges that require careful attention for the advancement of fuzzing, as well as for the results to be useful. These challenges and their possible solutions are listed in Table 4.\n\nChallengePossible solution\nMaintaining code validity, with code that is both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful. Often requires fuzzer implementation to include parts tailored to target language.Custom handwritten generators for more complicated parts of Kotlin\nFinding different types of bugs and thoroughly testing all compiler parts to ensure good compiler code coverage.Coverage-guided fuzzing: one component of the fitness function is X if a code snippet reaches so far unexplored compiler parts\nAfter finding bugs, localizing faults by determining the exact cause and the code responsible. Fuzzers often produce large amounts of test cases, which require manual analysis.  MOGDA, as it naturally prefers generating smaller and easier-to-understand programs \nA good fuzzer needs to be able to avoid duplicates and instead trigger new, unique bugs, instead of the same bugs repeatedly.For now, this problem is solved manually, but there are different possibilities to do this automatically\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Fuzzing challenges and possible solutions.\nOur Kotlin compiler team continues to address these challenges by improving fuzzing capabilities in an incremental fashion.

How much control do you need over your data? There are many considerations, and it can feel overwhelming. \nOne size won’t ever fit all, but as software development teams increasingly adopt DevOps practices and shift-left testing, we want to make integrating static code analysis tools like Qodana into your workflows easy and efficient. \nWith this in mind, we want to help you identify which setup is right for your team when it comes to deployment: Qodana Cloud or Self-Hosted Lite.\nEach option brings its own set of benefits and trade-offs. Whether you prioritize speed of adoption, data sovereignty, or infrastructure control, Qodana has a deployment path tailored to your needs. Below, we’ll walk through the key differences to help you make an informed decision.\nQodana Cloud: Fast, scalable, and genuinely easy to set up and use\n\n\n\n\nQodana Cloud is the simplest way to get started with static code analysis. Hosted and managed by JetBrains, it’s ideal for teams that want to minimize overhead and focus on code quality without worrying about infrastructure.\nFrom what we’ve seen, it’s best for teams that want zero setup and automatic updates, startups or mid-sized companies, and organizations that don’t have strict compliance needs. The Ultimate plan can be ideal for small-to-medium businesses that want to hit the ground running, but Ultimate Plus is universally the best option for code quality and security from Qodana. \nQodana Cloud is especially useful for organizations without dedicated DevOps resources or infrastructure constraints. For teams focused on speed and productivity, especially those in the early or rapid growth stages, Cloud can provide the shortest path to value.\nGo for Cloud if you want:\nLow maintenance, with super easy setup.\n\n\n\n\nTo stay up to date with the latest Qodana features.\n\n\n\n\nGood integration with JetBrains IDEs and popular CI/CD pipelines.\n\n\n\n\nSSO support and ID integration for easy access.\nQodana Self-Hosted Lite: Lightweight, quick to deploy, and fully self-hosted\n\n\n\n\nQodana Self-Hosted Lite is our newest offering. It’s a Docker-based, self-hosted package designed for quick setup and full feature parity with Ultimate Plus. \nIt’s perfect for teams that need data control without the complexity of full-scale infrastructure engineering, like enterprises and teams in regulated industries (such as healthcare, finance, or government). It’s also good for teams that need fast proof-of-concept or production installations or that operate in environments with limited or no internet access. \nLearn More\nSelf-Hosted Lite benefits:\nOne-command installation using the Qodana Installer CLI.\n\n\n\n\nWorks on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL).\n\n\n\n\nRuns on Docker Swarm (with Kubernetes support coming in Q4).\n\n\n\n\nFull feature-completeness, except for SSO in the cloud trial version.\nCloud vs. Self-Hosted Lite in a nutshell\n\nFeatureQodana CloudSelf-Hosted Lite\nSetup timeNearly instantVaries (can be quick)\nInfrastructureJetBrains-managedCustomer-managed (Docker)\nCompliance readinessModerateHigh\nSSO supportYes (Cloud Trial excluded)Yes\nKubernetes supportN/AComing Q4 2025\nIdeal use caseStarting quickly, small teamsProof of concept, secure environments\nUpdate modelAutoRe-pull Docker image\nAir-gapped supportNoYes (via mirrored images)\n\nQodana Cloud versus Qodana Self-Hosted Lite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right option for your team\nAt the risk of oversimplifying, there are a few easy ways to determine which version of Qodana will be most useful for your team. While our product experts will help you assess them more deeply, the following considerations can serve as a starting point.\nCloud\nWhile enterprises make up about 70% of static code analysis users, smaller teams who use linters are becoming more competitive. Many of the teams we’ve spoken to say Qodana Cloud gives them simplicity and speed, so they can focus on the code and start fixing issues quickly.\nWith fast onboarding and no specific infrastructure required, it’s a great choice for high levels of functionality, learning, and collaboration, as well as for getting quick insights into code quality.\nSelf-Hosted Lite\nSelf-Hosted Lite offers privacy and control over your data without the complexity of managing a full infrastructure. It’s a lightweight solution that helps you get the most out of Qodana’s capabilities, especially in sectors like government, finance, and healthcare, where a self-hosted option is preferred by around 45% to 50% of the market, according to Verified Market Reports.\nThe rest of your options will be determined by the license you opt for, like Ultimate versus Ultimate Plus. \nQodana has a dedicated team to help you decide!\nNo matter your team size or technical requirements, Qodana offers a way to integrate powerful static code analysis into your workflow.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Note: This article has been updated to reflect the status of perpetual fallback licenses under the new distribution model.\nWe are excited to announce the next step for IntelliJ IDEA: we are moving to a single, unified distribution. And yes, before you ask, our commitment to open source remains as strong as ever.\nThere will be just one IntelliJ IDEA installer, replacing the separate downloads for Community Edition and Ultimate Edition. In this new setup, all Ultimate features will still require a subscription to unlock. But even without a subscription, the IDE will remain fully functional, free to use for both commercial and non-commercial projects, and will include more features than the current Community Edition ever had.\nIn this article, we will walk you through the actual transition plan, what it means for your day-to-day development (spoiler: we expect it will only improve your experience), why we are making this change, how we are continuing to support open source, and other questions you might have about the new unified distribution.\nThe Plan for Transition\nThe move to a unified distribution will happen in several steps to ensure a smooth and transparent experience for all users. Here is how the transition will unfold and what it means for you. It will include three steps illustrated in the picture below.\n\nEnabling CI/CD Pipelines and Open Source Builds on GitHub\nWe are making it easier than ever to build IntelliJ IDEA from source. To support open-source workflows and improve transparency, we will begin publishing open-source builds directly to GitHub Releases. These builds will include only the open-source components, as outlined in the More Details About Open Source section below.\nWe are also introducing ready-to-use CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub Actions. With just a few steps, anyone can fork the project and produce a working build from the source.\nThis step is entirely non-intrusive and won’t affect your day-to-day workflow.\nIntroducing a Graceful License Expiration Experience\nStarting with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2, we are updating the licensing experience for Ultimate users. If your subscription expires, you won’t be locked out of the IDE. Instead, you will continue to have access to the same version of the IDE, but with the feature set matching what is available for free (previously known as Community Edition).\nThis means your work will not be interrupted, even if your subscription lapses while you are on vacation or between renewals. You will still be able to open your projects, write code, and stay productive, without the need to use another IntelliJ IDEA version.\nYour perpetual fallback license still works as before, giving you access to the last major version available at the time your most recent uninterrupted year of subscription began. With the unified distribution, this means you can activate older versions that match your fallback license. Alternatively, you can use the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA with access to its current free feature set.\nThis step affects only users of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and ensures a better experience in case of license expiration.\nMigrating to the Unified Distribution\nWith the 2025.3 release, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition will no longer be distributed as a separate product. Instead, all users will download a single IntelliJ IDEA distribution: one installer and one update stream.\nIf you are currently using Community Edition, your IDE will automatically update to the unified distribution via the usual patch update process. You will get access to additional features at no cost and a more seamless experience. You will also be able to try Ultimate features with just one click.\nThe change is minimal for Ultimate users: the IDE will simply be called IntelliJ IDEA without the “Ultimate” suffix.\nThe Way to Single Distribution\nWhen we introduced IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition in 2009, it was an important milestone — not only for the IDE, but also for JetBrains as a company. For the first time, we opened the source code of our IDE and provided a full-featured Java development environment for free. It was a bold step, and looking back, one of our best. We remain proud of it!\nThe Community Edition became the foundation of our open-source efforts. It enabled millions of developers to start using IntelliJ IDEA and helped build a strong ecosystem of contributors, plugin creators, educators, and learners. For many, it was their first introduction to Java or Kotlin programming and IntelliJ IDEA.\nOver time, though, the boundary between open-source and proprietary components blurred. Today, even the Community Edition includes some functionality that is not open source. This was never the original intention. These additions have been made gradually, one by one, to support real user needs. After years, they reached a critical mass that introduced inconsistency in what the “Community Edition” name was originally given to.\nOne of our longstanding goals has always been to provide a smooth “out-of-the-box” experience. That is what we continue to build. With the move to a single distribution, we want to honestly reflect the reality of what IntelliJ IDEA has become: a single, complete IDE that delivers the best experience for professional development with Java and Kotlin. It is powerful. It is free. It becomes even more capable with an Ultimate subscription. Its core remains open source, but it also includes functionality that, for business reasons, cannot be open-sourced.\nA Variety of Problems Solved with the Unified Distribution\nThere have been a number of other reasons for moving to a single distribution. Each reflects our long-term goals: delivering better quality, simplifying the user experience, and making IntelliJ IDEA more accessible to everyone.\nFewer versions mean better quality. Maintaining separate Community and Ultimate builds has always required parallel testing, validation, and packaging. By unifying the distribution, we can streamline development and focus our efforts more effectively, leading to faster iteration, fewer inconsistencies, and higher overall quality.\nLess confusion for educators and students. Many educators have told us that managing multiple versions creates friction in the classroom. It is not always clear which edition to install or what to do when a trial expires. With a unified distribution, we can offer a simpler setup for teaching and learning. It is also worth highlighting that IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate has always been free for students and classroom use, and we remain committed to supporting the academic community. We will continue to improve how educators and students access the full power of IntelliJ IDEA for educational purposes.\nFree can go beyond open source. While our commitment to open source remains unchanged, not all features can be open-sourced. However, we still want more developers to benefit from them. With this change, some previously Ultimate-only features will now be available for free, even though they remain proprietary. We believe that “free to use” should not be limited to “open-source only.”\nEasier access to premium features. Trying out IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate should be simple. The unified distribution removes friction from the trial experience, letting developers explore premium functionality without switching installers or environments.\nMore Features Available for Free, Ensuring a Great Experience for Every Java and Kotlin Developer\nThroughout our journey, we have always felt a strong responsibility to support developers just starting out — those who need to explore different frameworks without additional barriers. By unlocking the following features for free, we aim to remove obstacles for those beginning their professional development.\nCode highlighting beyond basic language support is essential for clear, readable code, especially when learning a new framework or language. Now, IntelliJ IDEA, with no subscription, provides syntax highlighting for popular frameworks like Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Micronaut, JPA (JPQL/HQL), templating engines such as Thymeleaf, Velocity, FreeMarker, and JSP, Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, and finally, non-JVM languages.\nQuick project setup is crucial for getting started quickly. In the unified distribution of IntelliJ IDEA, the list of wizards for setting up a new project will be extended for Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Micronaut, and Ktor. We will look into bringing more support for non-JVM languages in the future.\nDatabase schema exploration helps you visualize and understand your database structure more clearly. In the unified distribution, IntelliJ IDEA lets you connect to your database and view its schema (tables, columns, indexes) directly within the IDE, even without a subscription. While you won’t have access to data or SQL execution without a subscription, this feature offers a beginner-friendly view of your database design.\nFor developers looking for advanced tools and ultimate development comfort, IntelliJ IDEA offers powerful features like smart framework support, AI-assisted coding (available for all product pack subscribers or requires an additional AI subscription), remote development, advanced database tools, seamless polyglot experience, diagramming tools, UI test frameworks, a powerful profiler, HTTP Client, and more. These features will remain available to subscribers only, but with the unified distribution, everyone can try them easily with a one-click trial.\nMore Details About Open Source\nAs mentioned, our commitment to open source is as strong as ever. We will keep the open-source parts of the IntelliJ IDEA codebase on GitHub up to date and open for everyone. This codebase powers not only IntelliJ IDEA but also other well-known products like Android Studio, HCL Volt MX Iris, and Adobe AEM Developer Tools, as well as many internal tools in various companies used by developers every day. We take full responsibility for making sure these tools stay reliable and future-proof.\nTo make it easier for the community to use and contribute, we will provide CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), so anyone can build their own version from the source code. We will also start publishing open-source builds directly on GitHub, so you will be able to download and use them right away without setting up a build environment.\nThese builds will include only the open-source parts, just like the original Community Edition. Effectively, that means that GitHub builds will not include the following features:\nBackup and Sync — synchronizes your IDE settings and plugins across different machines using your JetBrains account\nPackage Checker — scans dependencies to reveal known security vulnerabilities\nAI ranking for code completion and search everywhere — improves output sorting for code completion and search everywhere\nAI Assistant — provides powerful AI support in JetBrains IDEs\nQodana plugin — maintains high code quality and compliance through static code analysis\nLocalization plugins (Japanese, Korean, Chinese) — translate IDE UI into multiple languages\nKotlin Notebook — enables interactive notebooks for Kotlin, targeting exploratory coding and data science tasks\nWSL capabilities — unlocks development in a real Linux environment while using Windows\nCode With Me — provides collaborative capabilities for real-time development\nHowever, most of these features, except WSL support, will be available as free plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace. So, if you would like to tailor your own IntelliJ IDEA setup, you will be able to manually install plugins you find useful. And they will always be available for free as part of the unified IntelliJ IDEA.\nFor the open-source builds, there will be no in-product update, new versions will be published on GitHub and can be downloaded from there.\nChanges to plugin development\nThe move to a unified distribution will introduce changes for plugin developers. These changes will only apply to plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later versions. We’ll provide additional details in a dedicated post closer to the start of the 2025.3 Early Access Program.\nConclusion\nWe are happy to continue delivering the professional tools you love. With this move to a single, unified distribution, we hope to make IntelliJ IDEA even better — higher quality, more features, and no more confusion over which version to download. Our commitment to open source remains as strong as ever: the Community Edition will stay fully available on GitHub, complete with CI/CD pipelines and nightly builds.\nWe hope all our users, from students and newcomers to seasoned enterprise gurus, will benefit from these changes.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At AI Summit London 2025, Kris Kang, Head of Product for AI at JetBrains, gave a talk that questioned a common belief in AI development: that bigger means better.\nThe industry has focused heavily on massive, general-purpose language models. These models offer impressive capabilities, but the cost of building and running them at scale is top of mind for many enterprise decision-markers.\nIn his talk “Small Models, Big Impact”, Kris introduced an alternative: focal models. These compact, domain-specific LLMs aim to deliver strong performance while reducing energy use and total cost of ownership. These models can be used as a workhorse complement to frontier models.”\nHere’s why this matters and how JetBrains is acting on it.\nThe energy cost of chasing scale\nAI models now operate at a scale that was hard to imagine a few years ago. Although there are no official numbers, observers estimate that GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, while estimates place GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion and Grok-3 at 2.7 trillion. To accommodate the growing size of models, data centers with as much as 2 million GPUs are being built.\nThe energy required for this is significant. Processing 1 billion AI chats, with a frontier model, can use more than 124 GWh per year (at 0.34 Wh per day), or equivalent to powering 31k UK households per year. The environmental impact alone raises important concerns, and the financial cost can be just as significant.\nFor a mid-sized company, using a frontier model daily might cost around USD 15,000, which adds up to USD 45,000 per employee per year. That figure is six times higher than the average IT expenditure per employee in 2023. This assumes: $15 per 10 requests, and an enterprise of 1,000 makes 10,000 requests per day, then that’s $15,000 per day. This is a conservative estimate.\nWhat are focal models?\nFocal models aim to solve a single problem with scalability in mind. They are:\nSmall, usually with fewer than 10 billion parameters\nDomain-specific, not general-purpose\nPost-trained to maximise cost efficiency and inference speed\nBuilt using techniques like quantisation, distillation, and Mixture of Experts techniques\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than trying to be good at everything (generating images, text-to-speech, coding, and more) they focus on high performance in a narrow field, such as code, legal, or medical tasks.\nThis specialisation allows enterprises to apply focal models to specific use cases that have the highest ROI per cost, where ROI might also include energy efficiency.\nMellum: A focal model purpose-built for code\nJetBrains has taken this concept and is applying it directly to software development. Mellum, our 4-billion-parameter model, is the first in a family we intend to open source. It was built from the ground up to support code completion in real-world settings.\nMellum works across multiple programming languages and has been optimized to run quickly on modest hardware (e.g. it can run locally easily on a Macbook M4 Max). Developers can use it in isolated environments without relying on third-party providers and without giving up control over their data. You can already access Mellum through JetBrains IDEs via our AI Assistant or on Hugging Face if you prefer to run it independently.\nRather than aiming for general use, Mellum stays focused on one job: helping developers write better code more efficiently.\nWhy focal models matter for the future of AI\nFocal models offer a practical answer to AI’s rising technical, financial, and environmental costs.\nBy narrowing the model’s purpose, teams can work with systems that cost less to operate and offer greater flexibility in how and where they’re deployed.\nThis also opens the door to deeper enterprise integration. Companies can fine-tune these models to fit their workflows or adapt them to meet compliance requirements without needing access to large-scale computeing clusters.\nFocal models do not replace frontier models but offer a complement that better suits many real-world applications.\nThe JetBrains perspective: Smarter, not just bigger\nJetBrains believes the next meaningful shift in AI will not come from chasing larger models but from refining how and where we apply them in order to help companies grow their businesses sustainably. We have invested in focal model development because our customers are asking for it, and we believe this approach delivers more balanced results.\nMellum is our first step in this direction. It shows what is possible when you focus on purpose instead of size.\nTry Mellum today\nYou can try Mellum in several ways:\nOn Hugging Face, for experimentation or offline use\nInside JetBrains IDEs, through AI Assistant\nSoon, as a containerised deployment in NVIDIA AI Enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you prioritise sustainability, performance, or security, focal models like Mellum offer a practical way to adopt LLMs where they bring the most value.\nThe future of AI is not just about using frontier models as they hit the market, it’s about sustainably embedding AI to your business that leads to positive outcomes.",

Perhaps most importantly, how will developers and AI collaborate over the next three to five years?\nThe AI 2027 outlook highlights the need for practical use, domain-specific design, and a focus on real results over hype.\nIn this article, we’ll offer insights into how AI is transforming the development landscape today and its potential impact on software development over the coming decade. Here’s an in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for developers and organizations.\nTwo possible futures\nWe’ll explore two potential timelines for the future: one where AGI fundamentally reshapes software development, and another where AI merely enhances our current practices.\nHere’s a quick recap of the trends we’ll have to stay on top of in order to know which future we’re headed toward:\nFirst off is the rise of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where machines gain human-like cognitive abilities. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has expressed confidence about AGI being right around the corner. However, experts like Meta’s Yann LeCun are more cautious, arguing that current systems remain far from that goal.\nAt Google I/O 2025, Google introduced Gemini 2.5 Pro with “Deep Think” reasoning, plus new tools like AI Mode for Search and Gemini Flow for video generation. \nAlternatively, AI is enhancing software development through advanced tools that assist developers in coding and problem-solving. Platforms like GitHub Copilot or JetBrains AI integrate models from various AI research organizations, allowing developers to choose the most effective AI assistance for their specific tasks. \nTools such as JetBrains Junie, Cursor Composer, Codex, or Windsurf Flows enable automating various tasks at the codebase level at a rate unimaginable before. This integration boosts productivity and democratizes coding.\nAs AI continues to evolve, the software development landscape stands at a crossroads between the pursuit of AGI and the augmentation of human capabilities through AI-powered tools.\nScenario 1: A full-blown AI future \nAs technology gets closer and closer to the level of AGI, we’re beginning to see AI agents that don’t just assist, but actively write code. These systems can handle complex engineering tasks, with capabilities approaching those of senior-level developers. Early examples include Devin, which can plan and execute full development workflows, and Honeycomb, which integrates autonomous agents into real-world software pipelines. In systems evaluation, progress is often measured using benchmarks like SWE-bench, which focuses on resolving localized GitHub issues. Taken together, these efforts mark the emergence of autonomous AI agents that we can call “AI developers”.\nWe can even imagine AI developers eventually working together in teams, much the same way humans do today, with each having its own specialized area (development, testing, project coordination, etc.). This idea is gaining traction in research. Examples include RepoAgent, which applies multiple agents to full-stack tasks in real repositories, and AgentCoder, which simulates collaborative agent roles throughout the software workflow.\nAI developers need a home, too\nAI developers will demand their own workspace ecosystem. This isn’t just a theoretical concept – it’s an immediate challenge facing organizations integrating AI into their development workflows.\nThis evolution will unfold naturally over the next few years, from enhanced ML capabilities in enterprise environments to fully customizable AI developer solutions. For some AI developers, this “home” may exist within centralized cloud-based platforms.\nFor others, local inference offers an alternative path. Tools like Ollama already allow powerful models to run directly on consumer hardware. With quantization, even 30B+ parameter models can run locally on high-end GPUs, opening the door to secure, offline-first AI development environments. Organizations that recognize and adapt to this shift early will gain a meaningful edge on the AI-driven development landscape.\nAI teams need tools\nAs teams of AI developers (let’s call them “AI teams”) become more advanced, they’ll need specialized tools to manage every part of their workflow, from coding and testing to handling documentation and requirements. The AutoCodeRover team was among the first to show how advanced tools make it far easier for agents to solve problems. Since then, we’ve seen an uptick in environments and platforms for AI developers: hide, OpenHands, and others. AI teams rely on robust, integrated platforms, just like humans do.\nThe ultimate breakthrough would be a platform that gives AI models direct, seamless access to all the essential tools in one centralized space. This setup would allow AI developers to operate as smoothly as human developers within a single interface by eliminating the need for complex integrations. \nEarly efforts in this direction include OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent (CUA), which enables models to interact with existing software on a desktop, and Anthropic’s ComputerUse, which gives Claude the ability to control full computing environments. \nBoth approaches reflect a shared goal: equipping AI developers with the same types of digital toolkits that humans use.\nHumans need next-generation IDEs to collaborate with AI teams \nEven with AI teams doing the heavy lifting, we’ll still need humans to guide, refine, and approve the final product. Next-generation IDEs will be essential for this, bridging the gap between human insight and AI productivity.\nIn fact, there’s an entire new field of study emerging, known as Human-AI eXperience (HAX). This field is all about finding efficient ways for human developers to interact with their AI tools. Soon enough, we’ll be faced with a flood of AI-generated code, and we’ll need IDEs that can understand and verify this code for us, while we humans stay focused on the big picture stuff (setting requirements, visualizing project progress, etc.).\nAt JetBrains, we’re exploring more effective ways for humans to collaborate with AI systems, including ongoing experiments like AIR. We’re staying on top of broader developments in this space, and view tools like Claude Code, Warp AI, Gemini CLI, Google Jules, Cursor, Coedium, and DevGPT as strongly indicative of how the landscape is shifting.\nAI teams need a marketplace\nAs AI developers produce more code, they’ll need a dedicated marketplace – a central hub for storing, finding, and reusing AI-generated code (like GitHub for AI agents).\nExisting platforms aren’t built for this use case. They assume human intent, manual review, and slow feedback cycles. An AI-first marketplace would need different foundations, like built-in sandboxing to safely test unknown contributions, automated verification pipelines to check compatibility and quality, and metadata designed to help AI developers understand, rate, and select what they need.\nWithout these features, reuse becomes risky and inefficient. With them, AI teams can move faster, collaborate safely, and continuously improve shared assets.\nAI will face regulations \nThe AI learning curve isn’t specific to developers. Lawyers and policymakers will also have to learn the ropes.\nThe first problem is safety. Obviously AI is not immune to making mistakes, and these mistakes can cause real-world damage. Studies have shown that trustworthy AI code may be a long way off. For the foreseeable future, we should be treating AI-generated code with the same scrutiny that we apply to, say, self-driving cars. Formal audits and certifications are a must.\nSecondly, the prevalence of AI may raise new questions about intellectual property and its definitions. For example, when we use publicly available code to train models, are we infringing on the rights of the original authors? Recent lawsuits, such as those involving GitHub Copilot and Open AI, force us to ask this question. Attribution and licensing will only become more complex as AI generates code at scale.\nThis creates a major opportunity for companies that develop tools to inspect and certify AI-generated code. Tools that can identify AI-created code, flag potential risks, and approve it will protect users and build trust.\nSoftware may look different from the inside \nAI developers could end up training themselves, learning and evolving their coding patterns through countless iterations of trial and error. Early work in this direction appeared in 2022, including projects like CodeRL, which applied reinforcement learning to optimize code generation based on execution feedback. While the code might still be written in familiar languages like Java or Kotlin, its structure could be optimized entirely for machine efficiency, not human readability.\nAn even more frightening thought is that we could end up with new programming languages that don’t follow any of the patterns we humans are familiar with, as they were designed entirely for AI developers. This isn’t science fiction – it’s the next frontier in software development, where AI might write code that is essentially unrecognizable to us.\nAs Erik Meijer outlines in his ACM article, we may soon need to accept a world where code serves machines first, with humans relying on meta-tools to inspect and tweak the output. The result? Faster, more efficient business systems, even if we need new abstractions to understand what’s going on under the hood.\nSoftware may look the same, but with AI developers choosing their favorites \nIn the AI era, a language’s success might depend more on its available codebase than its elegant syntax. It’s simple math – the more code examples available, the better AI can understand that language and generate code in it.\nThis creates a unique opportunity to position programming languages for AI adoption. The goal isn’t to replace programming languages, but to develop them for this new collaborative future. \nLanguages like Rust, with strong memory safety guarantees, or Dafny, which supports formal verification, offer valuable properties in contexts where reliability matters. Others, like Julia, scale well for numerical and data-heavy tasks, making them attractive for AI workflows. The race to become AI’s preferred programming language is just beginning.\nThe legacy code challenge\nLet’s talk about the elephant in the room: legacy code. While everyone’s excited about AI generating new applications, there’s a trillion-dollar reality we can’t ignore. We have a massive amount of code powering our world, and it’s not going anywhere.\n\n\n\n\nThe real opportunity here lies in creating smart maintenance solutions that can handle enterprise-scale challenges. Some examples are tools that can help modernize legacy codebases, automatically suggest library updates, and provide deep insights across millions of lines of code. \nScenario 2: AI as an enhancer\nIn this more conservative vision of the future, AI doesn’t replace developers, but supercharges their work and transforms the toolkit they rely on. Developers remain firmly in control, and AI merely helps their productivity skyrocket.\nAdvancement in AI support beyond coding \nIn the future, activities like debugging, profiling, and configuring development environments are likely to become partially or fully automated. So far, automation has primarily focused on accelerating coding itself. The next generation of AI tools will likely handle a broader range of tasks, such as finding bugs and optimizing performance.\nHowever, even as these tasks are automated, human developers will still be critical in reviewing and verifying the AI’s work. The challenge will be creating tools that assist in these tasks and build trust, enabling developers to quickly confirm that the AI’s actions are correct and helpful.\nAI developers as part of human teams \nSoftware teams are already moving towards including AI as active contributors. We can see early signs in tools like GitHub bots that fix vulnerabilities without human input. Before long, AI agents could take on everyday tasks like resolving issues, updating documents, and tidying up codebases.\nThis shift lets developers spend more time on complex, creative work while AI handles the routine upkeep.\nIDEs adapted to work with AI developers \nThis shift is already underway. As AI joins development teams, human developers will need tools to manage these new digital teammates. That means assigning tasks, tracking progress, and reviewing output, all within the IDE.\nNew, user-friendly interfaces will help developers see what each agent is working on, check task lists, and respond to questions. As AI performs more updates and maintenance, these manager-style tools will become essential. Like any teammate, AI may also reach out for help when needed.\nAI assistants beyond development\nWhat if everyone involved in the development process (product managers, QA engineers, DevOps teams, and more) had their own AI helper? We seem to be headed in this direction already, with startups popping up to offer AI-powered assistance to roles outside traditional software engineering.\nThe end goal? Less time spent on routine tasks and more time for people to focus on strategic work, reviewing results, and making key decisions.\nThere’s a boatload of untapped potential for increased productivity here. Now is the time to start exploring what each professional needs from their AI assistant and get a few prototypes up and running. \nAI assistants as technical leads\nIt won’t be long before AI assistants can act as “tech leads”, ready to answer any question you have about your project. LLMs can already handle general questions and give insights on specific sections of code, but for now, only within the highly specific context presented by the prompt.\nAs these models evolve, they’ll be able to draw from the entire codebase, the project’s development history, issues from the tracker, team chats, and all documentation. \nAI needs control \nAs AI generates more and more code, we will need ways to keep track of it, verify its quality, and ensure it works as expected. Simply reviewing AI-generated code will not be enough to guarantee its reliability. One likely development is the introduction of Git-level tagging to mark code as AI-generated, making it easier to trace and manage throughout the lifecycle.\nThis is only part of the picture. We will also need tools designed specifically for testing and auditing code written by machines. Platforms like SonarQube are already evolving to support more automated quality checks, and efforts to build policy-aware validation frameworks are gaining traction.\nLooking ahead, companies working in this space may help shape how we standardize, track, and certify AI-generated code. Broader regulatory initiatives are also emerging, such as the EU AI Act and guidance from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), both of which emphasise transparency, accountability, and traceability as essential principles for responsible AI use in software development.\nAI-powered education\nAs AI reshapes development, our approach to teaching programming should keep pace. Imagine new devs learning not just to code, but to code in an AI-enhanced environment that mirrors real-world development. By integrating AI into programming education, we can help beginners adopt tools faster and more naturally, setting them up for success with the technologies they’ll use.\nWrapping up: An AI-powered future is inevitable \nWe’ve looked at current AI trends shaping software development and explored two vastly different AI-driven scenarios. Regardless of what the future holds, one thing is clear: AI will evolve from a supportive assistant into a proactive player in coding, testing, and analysis. This shift will create new roles for developers as guides and reviewers, collaborating closely with AI agents.\nAs AI automates more routine work and gains richer project context, we’ll need fresh interfaces, reliable verification tools, and adaptable workflows. Preparing for this future means advancing machine learning, experimenting with interfaces, and deepening AI integration. Thanks for joining us on this exploration!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve just released Koog 0.3.0, which comes with many updates that make building, running, and managing intelligent agents easier.\nThis version focuses on durability, speed, observability, and smoother integration with real-world systems. If you’ve been exploring how to develop your own intelligent agent that can handle complex workflows, the new and updated Koog could be just what you’re looking for. Find it now on GitHub.\nHere’s a breakdown of what’s new in v0.3.0:\nLearn more\nAgents that don’t forget\nIn Koog 0.3.0, agents can now remember what they were doing. You can save and reload their state from a local disk, S3 buckets, or a database. This powerful feature enables server-side developers to build fault-tolerant agentic solutions by restoring the agent’s entire state machine at the exact point of strategy execution instead of just recovering the message history.\nThis means you can shut down machines without losing progress. There’s also a new checkpoint feature, so agents can roll back to any earlier state if needed.\n\nSmarter storage for better retrieval\nKoog now supports persistent vector storage for docs. Whether you’re working with local files or connecting to a vector database, you can use Koog to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.\nThe setup is modular, allowing you to add support for different formats, ranking methods, and backends.\n\nBuilt-In observability and moderation for agents\nWe’ve added native OpenTelemetry support. This means you can now trace, log, and measure your agents using the same tools you’d use elsewhere in your system, enabling you to spot bottlenecks, track behaviour, and keep things running smoothly.\n\nAnd if you’re deploying in regulated environments, there’s also built-in support for moderation. Agents can now check their own outputs to make sure they’re appropriate and safe. This is especially useful when trust and compliance are a priority.\nRunning tasks in parallel\nSometimes your agent graph includes steps that can run independently. Koog now supports parallel execution of those nodes, following a familiar MapReduce-style API.\nYou can launch several branches simultaneously, transform their results asynchronously, and collect everything at the end. This approach is useful when you want to try multiple strategies at once or speed up multi-step workflows.\n\nA better fit for your stack\nKoog now works better with Spring. If you’re using Spring Boot, you’ll get ready-made beans and auto-configured LLM clients out of the box.\nThe release also adds support for ReAct-style agent thinking. Agents can now follow step-by-step reasoning paths, switching between thoughts and actions.\nYou’ll also find updates that help agents handle uncertainty better. The new Retry component makes them more resilient, and multiple-choice reasoning gives them new ways to explore options and respond to user preferences.\nA few more things to get excited about\nThis version brings a handful of other improvements that are worth highlighting:\nAgents can now receive image input when running with Ollama-backed models.\nFull WebAssembly (WASM) support means you can now deploy Koog agents to the browser.\nNative support for Amazon Bedrock has been added.\nFact-retrieval history compression has been improved to help agents focus on the correct data without getting confused by unrelated context.\nAgents can now work with arbitrary input and output types, providing greater flexibility in the execution flow.\nWe’ve also fixed several bugs to make the overall UX smoother.\nKoog 0.3.0 is a step toward making agents more robust, portable, and valuable.\nMany of these updates were implemented on the basis of community feedback, so thanks to everyone who’s tried it out, opened issues, or shared ideas. \nIf you haven’t yet, now’s a good time to try Koog and see what you can build.\nYour contributions make the difference\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to extend a huge thank-you to the entire community for contributing to the development of Koog through your feedback, issue reports, and pull requests!\nHere’s a list of this release’s top contributors:\nNathan Fallet Azure OpenAI and other general improvements\nDidier Villevalois Ollama updates\nJason Pearson AWS Bedrock improvements\nDenys Kurylenko MCP enhancements",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "While building Spring Boot applications, you can leverage Testcontainers to spin up any required services, such as a database or messaging broker, as Docker containers at application startup. This enables a ready-to-code setup, minimizing environment friction so you can focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable code.\nFor database-driven development, IntelliJ IDEA provides enterprise-grade, professional-level tooling out of the box. You can:\nReverse-engineer JPA entities from an existing schema\nGenerate Flyway or Liquibase migrations directly from your JPA models\nAccess a suite of built-in integrations (e.g., SQL consoles, schema diff, and more) that help you maintain a clean, consistent database lifecycle\nIntelliJ IDEA’s ergonomic UI and preconfigured environments allow you to code faster, refactor more smoothly, and catch potential issues before they become bugs. This means that using IntelliJ IDEA combined with Testcontainers is a productivity booster. However, there is just one problem…\nTestcontainers map container ports to random host ports to avoid conflicts. Each time you restart your application, you must fetch the new mapped port and manually update IntelliJ IDEA’s DataSource connection properties.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains addressed this problem with the Spring Debugger plugin. It automatically registers the DataSource connection to any relational databases started by Testcontainers. Additionally, the DataSource connection will be automatically created while running Testcontainers tests. You can use the Spring Debugger plugin with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.1.2 or any later versions.\nNOTE: Spring Debugger automatic DataSource registration works with Testcontainers and Docker Compose too.\nYou can also watch the demonstration of Spring Debugger plugin’s automatic DataSource registration feature in this video.\n\n\nSpring Debugger: Working With Dynamic Database Connections Just Got Simpler\n\n\n\nLet’s explore this feature using a practical example.\nLocal development using Testcontainers\nTo follow along, clone the Spring Boot sample project from here.\nThis repository contains a Spring Boot REST API project using the starters Spring Web, Validation, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Flyway Migration, and Testcontainers.\nOpen the project in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and run TestBookmarksApplication.java in debug mode to start the application.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when you start the application, Testcontainers start a PostgreSQL database, and a PostgreSQL DataSource is automatically registered in IntelliJ IDEA’s Database tool window.\nNOTE: The DataSource will be automatically registered ONLY when you start the application in debug mode.\nWhen you stop the application, the registered DataSource will be automatically deleted from the Database tool window.\nDebugging Testcontainers based tests\nA DataSource is automatically registered both when running the application and when running tests. You can run your Testcontainers-based tests in debug mode, set a breakpoint, and explore the data in your database.\nHere is an example of running a Spring Boot integration test that interacts with a PostgreSQL database started by Testcontainers.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, while running the test, we can set a breakpoint and verify the data in the database if needed.\nHere is another example of debugging a Spring Data JPA Repository test using @DataJpaTest.\n\n\n\n\nLocal development and testing with MongoDB\nIn addition to the relational databases, the automatic registration of the DataSource works for MongoDB as well.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIntelliJ IDEA’s automatic registration of Testcontainers data sources in the Database tool window eliminates the need for manually registering the DataSources. This makes local development and debugging of the Testcontainers tests using databases much simpler.\nAs of now, this feature works for relational databases and MongoDB only, but support for more databases will be added in upcoming IntelliJ IDEA versions.\nTo learn more about the features of the Spring Debugger plugin, please read the documentation.\nWhat are you waiting for? Download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and install the Spring Debugger plugin and try the features of its plugin for yourself.",

ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini 같은 최신 AI들의 글쓰기 실력은 정말 놀라울 정도예요.\n어떤 때는 사람이 쓴 건지 AI가 쓴 건지 구분하기 어려울 정도더라고요. 제가 직접 써보니, 적절한 프롬프트만 주면 AI는 전문 작가 수준의 글을 척척 뽑아낼 수 있어요. 정말이지!\nAI 글쓰기의 빛나는 장점들 ✨\n압도적인 속도: 사람이 200페이지 소설을 쓰려면 몇 달이 걸리지만, AI는 제대로 된 프롬프트만 있으면 하루 만에도 가능하답니다. 이건 정말 혁신적이죠!\n일관된 톤 앤 매너: 사람은 컨디션에 따라 글의 톤이 달라지기도 하는데, AI는 한번 설정을 해두면 끝까지 일관된 문체와 어조를 유지해줘요.\n무한한 아이디어 뱅크: 글쓰기가 막혔을 때 AI에게 물어보면 정말 다양한 아이디어를 제시해줘요. 마치 똑똑한 브레인스토밍 파트너가 하나 생긴 기분이라니까요!\n다재다능한 장르 대응: 소설, 에세이, 자기계발서, 시집까지! AI는 장르를 가리지 않고 각각의 특성에 맞는 글을 써줄 수 있어요.\n  알아두세요!\nAI는 단순히 글을 쓰는 것을 넘어, 주어진 프롬프트에 따라 글의 구조, 톤, 스타일까지 맞춰주는 진정한 글쓰기 동반자로 진화했어요.\n \nAI 글쓰기의 그림자, 그리고 해결책  \n물론 AI 글쓰기에도 단점은 존재해요. 완벽할 순 없잖아요, 솔직히?\nAI 글쓰기의 아쉬운 점들  \n감정의 진정성 부족: AI가 아무리 감동적인 글을 써도, 실제 경험에서 우러나온 진짜 감정을 표현하기는 아직 어렵다는 게 제 생각이에요.\n창의성의 한계: AI는 기본적으로 기존 데이터를 조합해서 새로운 걸 만들어내는 방식이라, 정말 독창적이고 혁신적인 아이디어는 아직 좀 부족한 편입니다.\n문맥 이해의 미흡함: 긴 글을 쓸 때 앞뒤 맥락을 완벽하게 이해하지 못할 때가 있어요. 그래서 중간에 내용이 갑자기 툭 튀어나오거나, 앞뒤가 안 맞는 내용이 나올 수도 있죠.\nAI 검출 문제: 요즘 AI 검출 도구들이 정말 많이 발달했잖아요. AI가 쓴 글인지 사람이 쓴 글인지 구분하는 프로그램들이 막 나오고 있거든요. 물론 모든 검출기가 100% 잡아낼 수 있는지는 저도 의심스럽긴 하지만요.\n하지만 이 모든 문제를 해결할 방법이 있어요! 바로 제가 오늘 소개해드릴 '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침'이에요. 이 지침을 사용하면 AI의 장점은 최대화하면서 단점은 최소화할 수 있답니다. 정말이죠!\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nAI 글쓰기의 단점은 적절한 프롬프트 설계와 인간적인 편집 과정을 통해 충분히 극복할 수 있어요. 무조건 AI에게만 의존하기보다는, 보조 도구로 활용하는 지혜가 필요합니다.\n \n전자책으로 수익 창출의 시대  \n이제 이렇게 AI로 만든 글로 어떻게 수익을 낼 수 있는지 한번 알아보겠습니다. 요즘 개인 출판 시장이 정말 뜨거워요. 예전에는 책을 출간하려면 출판사를 찾아다니고, 편집자 미팅하고... 정말 복잡하고 시간도 많이 걸렸잖아요? 그런데 지금은 완전히 달라졌어요!\n여러분이 집에서 글만 쓰면, 클릭 몇 번으로 전국 서점에 여러분의 책이 올라가는 시대가 된 거예요. 제가 지금부터 소개해드릴 네 가지 플랫폼을 보시면 정말 놀라실 겁니다!\n주요 개인 출판 플랫폼 소개  \n플랫폼\n주요 특징\n수익률 (예시)\n\n\n\n\n교보문고 POD 바로출판\n누구나 무료 출판 가능, 전자책 종이책 동시 출간, PDF/워드 파일 업로드, 2~3일 내 심사 완료 및 판매 시작\n명시되지 않음\n\n\n부크크 (Bookk)\n무료 출판 (전자책 완전 무료), 교보문고/리디북스/밀리의서재 등 광범위한 유통망, 표지 자동 템플릿, ISBN 발급 대행\n예스24 판매 시 저자 60% (예: 1만원 책 판매 시 6천원)\n\n\n유페이퍼 (UPAPER)\n콘텐츠 웹 퍼블리싱 플랫폼, 직접 판매 시 70% 수익, 제휴사 판매 시 60% 수익, 익익월 말 정산, 다양한 전자책 플랫폼 유통\n직접 판매 70%, 제휴사 판매 60%\n\n\n이퍼플 (ePubl)\n카멜팩토리 운영, 국내외 17곳 이상 대형 온라인 서점 유통 (Google Play, iBooks 포함), 매월 10일 판매내역 등록, 익월 20일 인세 지급, 6,581종 전자책 제작 실적 (2012년 설립 이후)\n명시되지 않음 (인세 지급)\n\n\n\n개인 출판, 왜 이렇게 매력적일까요?  \n낮은 진입장벽: 출판사 없이도 개인이 직접 책을 낼 수 있어요. 부담 없이 시작할 수 있죠.\n높은 인세율: 일반 출판사 대비 훨씬 높은 수익률을 자랑해요. 노력한 만큼 더 많이 가져갈 수 있습니다.\n빠른 출간: 책을 내는 데 걸리는 시간이 이삼일밖에 안 걸려요! 정말 빠르죠?\n다양한 유통망: 주요 온라인 서점은 물론이고, 해외 서점까지 모두 커버할 수 있습니다.\n저렴한 비용 부담: 대부분 무료이거나 최소 비용만 들어가요. ISBN 발급비도 1,000원 수준이니 정말 부담 없죠.\n하지만 여기서 정말 중요한 건 바로 '품질'이에요. 아무리 AI가 도와준다고 해도, 독자들에게 실제 도움이 되고 감동을 줄 수 있는 내용이어야 하거든요. 그래서 오늘 소개해드릴 지침처럼 체계적인 프롬프트 설계가 정말 중요한 거죠!\n \n맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침: GEM의 비밀  \n이제 본격적으로 제가 개발한 'GEM 지침'의 특징을 소개해드릴게요. 이 지침의 가장 큰 특징은 바로 '체계성'이에요. 그냥 대충 \"소설 써줘\"가 아니라, 3단계로 나누어서 정말 체계적으로 접근합니다.\n3단계 체계적인 프롬프트 설계 과정  \n1단계: 장르 선택 (8개 장르 지원)\n수필, 소설, 시, 자기계발서, 인문학 도서, 실용서 등 총 8가지 장르 중에서 여러분의 글에 가장 적합한 장르를 선택하는 단계예요.\n2단계: 요구사항 수집 (8가지 핵심 정보)\n여기가 정말 중요해요! 핵심 주제부터 독자 분석, 목표 설정, 스타일, 차별점, 분량, 문단 형식, 제목 선호도까지 총 8가지 핵심 정보를 체계적으로 파악합니다. 이 정보들이 있어야 AI가 여러분의 의도를 정확히 이해할 수 있어요.\n3단계: 맞춤형 프롬프트 생성 (CO-STAR 프레임워크 활용)\n앞에서 수집한 모든 정보를 바탕으로 'CO-STAR 프레임워크'를 활용해서 여러분만을 위한 완성된 맞춤형 프롬프트를 만들어줍니다.\n장르별 특화된 전문 템플릿  \n각 장르마다 전문 템플릿이 따로 있어요. 예를 들어 수필 같은 경우는 '주제 도입-주제 심화-주제 승화' 구조로 되어 있고, 각 부마다 어떤 내용이 들어가야 하는지 상세하게 가이드가 제공됩니다. 자기계발서는 '문제 인식-해결책 제시-실천 방법'의 3부 구조이고, 심리학 도서는 '심리학적 이해-사례와 분석-치유와 성장' 구조죠. 이렇게 장르별로 최적화된 구조를 제공하니까 AI가 훨씬 전문적이고 체계적인 글을 써줄 수 있어요.\nAI 검출 회피를 위한 인간적 글쓰기 원칙 ✍️\n이 부분이 정말 핵심이에요! AI가 쓴 글인지 사람이 쓴 글인지 구분하는 검출기들이 점점 정교해지고 있잖아요? 그래서 이 지침에는 'AI 검출 회피'를 위한 인간적 글쓰기 원칙들이 포함되어 있습니다.\n일부러 문장 구조를 완벽하지 않게 만든다거나,\n\"정말\", \"솔직히 말해서\" 같은 감탄사나 간투사를 자연스럽게 넣는다거나,\n개인적인 경험과 감정을 글에 자연스럽게 포함시키는 방법들이죠.\n이런 기법들을 적절히 활용하면 AI 검출기를 통과할 확률이 훨씬 높아져요.\n자동 세계관 구축 및 시각적 마인드맵  ️\n정말 혁신적인 기능 중 하나가 바로 '자동 세계관 구축'이에요. 사용자가 \"시작\"이라고 입력하면, 앞에서 설정한 정보를 바탕으로 완성된 세계관을 자동으로 생성해줍니다.\n문학 장르: 주요 인물 설정, 인물 간 관계도, 시간과 공간적 배경, 주요 사건 연표, 갈등 구조, 주제 의식과 상징체계까지 모든 게 자동으로 만들어져요.\n비문학 장르: 핵심 개념 정의, 주요 논거와 근거 자료, 대표 사례와 데이터 분석, 논리적 구조, 실용적 도구 목록까지 체계적으로 구성됩니다.\n세계관이 완성되면 이걸 바탕으로 시각적인 마인드맵을 HTML 형태로 생성해줘요. Markmap 라이브러리를 사용해서 브라우저에서 바로 실행 가능한 인터랙티브 마인드맵이 만들어지죠. 이 마인드맵을 보면 여러분의 책 전체 구조가 한눈에 들어와요. 각 노드를 클릭하면 확장되고 축소되면서, 전체 작품의 연결 관계를 쉽게 파악할 수 있답니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI 덕분에 마인드맵을 직접 손으로 그리지 않고도 HTML로 편리하게 구현할 수 있게 되어, 세계관을 시각적으로 정리하고 공유하는 데 매우 유용해요. 이렇게 디지털 마인드맵으로 구현된 세계관은 각 요소 간의 관계를 명확히 보여주어 일관성 있는 스토리텔링을 돕고, 필요한 정보를 빠르고 쉽게 찾아 창작 효율성을 크게 높여줍니다.\n \n'나도 작가' GEM 지침 활용 가이드  ‍ \n자, 이제 '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침'을 어떻게 만드는지 알려드릴게요.\n'나도 작가' GEM 생성 단계  ️\n1단계: 파일 다운로드 및 GEM 생성 준비\n먼저 영상 설명란 또는 고정 댓글의 링크를 통해 제 블로그를 방문하신 후, 이번 지침을 다운로드하세요. 총 3개의 파일이 있는데, 하나는 메인 지침이고 나머지는 참고 파일입니다.\n2단계: '나도 작가' GEM 만들기\n'새 GEM 만들기'를 클릭하고, 이름을 예를 들어 \"나도 작가\"라고 입력합니다. 그 다음 메인 지침 파일을 열어서 복사하신 후 요청 사항에 붙여넣기합니다. 다음으로 나머지 첨부 파일 2개를 지식에 등록하고 저장하면 이번 GEM 생성이 완료됩니다.\n'나도 작가' GEM 구동 방식 이해하기  \n방금 만든 \"나도 작가\" GEM 지침은 특정 주제에 맞는 글을 쓰는 젬 지침을 생성하는 범용 도구예요. 사용자가 원하는 장르와 구체적인 주제를 입력하면, 이 젬 지침이 해당 정보를 바탕으로 완전히 맞춤화된 글쓰기 프롬프트를 생성합니다.\n예를 들어 \"실용서\" 장르에 \"주린이를 위한 7일 단기 주식 공부\"라는 주제를 입력하면, 여기에 맞는 글쓰기 젬 지침을 만들 수 있는 거죠. 따라서 \"주린이를 위한 7일 단기 주식 공부\" 프롬프트가 포함된 이 젬은 이 책 한 권을 완성할 때까지만 사용하고, 글 작성이 끝나면 이 맞춤형 도구의 역할도 끝나는 겁니다. 다시 새로운 책을 쓰고 싶다면, \"나도 작가\" 젬에서 새로운 주제 정보를 입력하고 별도의 젬을 새로 생성해야 해요. 결국 이번 영상의 핵심 젬 활용법은 글쓰기 프롬프트를 만드는 프롬프트 기법인 것입니다!\n'나도 작가' GEM 사용 시나리오  \n1단계: 장르 및 핵심 주제 선택\n젬을 실행하고 \"시작\"을 입력하면 어떤 장르의 글을 쓸 건지 물어봅니다. 저는 1번 \"수필\"을 선택할게요. 그러면 어떤 핵심 주제로 글을 쓸 건지 몇 가지 예시와 함께 물어봅니다. 저는 일단 예시에 있는 \"일상 속에서 발견하는 소소한 행복\"을 입력하겠습니다.\n2단계: 8가지 구체적인 질문에 응답\n이번에는 글을 쓰기 위한 좀 더 구체적인 질문 8개를 물어봅니다. '저는 독자는 30~40대, 목표는 이 글을 읽은 이들이 감정적 변화와 힐링을 얻으면 좋을 것 같고, 글의 톤은 친근하게'와 같이 8개 항목에 모두 응답할 거예요. 그리고 젬이 제시한 5개 제목 중에 하나를 선택하거나 주제와 관련된 제목을 직접 입력하셔도 됩니다. 저는 \"행복은 늘 당신 곁에 있었다\"를 선택하겠습니다.\n  중요해요!\n이 과정은 AI가 사용자의 글쓰기 의도를 정확하고 구체적으로 파악하여 맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트를 생성하는 데 필요한 핵심 정보를 수집하기 때문에 매우 중요하니, 실제 사용하실 때는 신중하게 입력해야 합니다.\n3단계: 맞춤형 글쓰기 젬 지침 생성\n그러면 \"일상 속에서 발견하는 소소한 행복\"이라는 제목의 수필을 만들기 위한 젬 지침을 생성하기 시작합니다. 이때 인용 코드가 많이 포함되는데, 젬의 동작에는 지장이 없으니 그냥 사용하셔도 됩니다. 완성된 젬 지침을 복사하고, '새 젬 만들기'에서 이번 수필 작업을 위한 젬 지침을 등록합니다. 이때 \"나도 작가\" 젬을 만들 때 추가한, '작업 흐름 가이드.TXT'를 꼭 첨부하셔야 합니다.\n생성된 맞춤형 GEM 활용하기  \n새로 만든 \"행복은 늘 당신 곁에 있었다\" 수필 작업 젬에서 \"시작\"을 입력합니다. 이러면 목차와 함께 이 글의 세계관이 상세하게 작성이 됩니다.\n세계관 설정의 중요성  \n글을 쓸 때 세계관을 미리 설정하는 것은 이야기의 일관성과 논리성을 확보하고, 캐릭터의 행동에 개연성을 부여하며, 궁극적으로 독자의 몰입감을 극대화하는 데 필수적입니다. 탄탄한 세계관은 작가의 창의성을 자극하고, 스토리를 확장할 수 있는 무한한 가능성을 제공합니다. 따라서 세계관 설정은 단순한 배경 묘사를 넘어, 완성도 높은 글을 위한 핵심적인 작업이라 할 수 있습니다.\n여기서 중요한 과정이 있어요. 바로 완성된 세계관을 메모장에 붙여넣고 저장한 후에 현재의 젬에 추가를 해야 합니다. 이렇게 해야 이 세계관을 기반으로 글이 작성됩니다.\n세계관 마인드맵 생성  ️\n세계관이 완성이 되었다면 이를 기반으로 마인드맵을 생성해볼게요. 마인드맵을 생성할 때는 캔버스 기능을 꼭 활성화해야 바로 미리보기가 가능합니다. AI 덕분에 마인드맵을 직접 손으로 그리지 않고도 HTML로 편리하게 구현할 수 있게 되어, 세계관을 시각적으로 정리하고 공유하는 데 매우 유용합니다.\n이렇게 디지털 마인드맵으로 구현된 세계관은, 각 요소 간의 관계를 명확히 보여주어 일관성 있는 스토리텔링을 돕고, 필요한 정보를 빠르고 쉽게 찾아, 창작 효율성을 크게 높여줍니다.\n글 작성 및 수정 기능 활용 ✍️\n마인드맵을 통해 확인한 세계관에 문제가 없다면, 바로 글을 작성해볼게요. 이때 캔버스 기능은 계속 켜두시면 됩니다. 먼저 채팅 창에 '작가의 말' 작성을 요청하겠습니다. 잠시 기다리시면 \"작가의 말\"이 이렇게 작성이 됩니다.\nGemini의 캔버스에서는 작성된 글을 AI를 활용해 수정할 수 있는 세 가지 유용한 기능이 있어요. 바로 수정 제안, 어조 및 길이 변경입니다.\n수정 제안: 글의 부족한 부분에 대한 추가 정보나 설명을 제안하거나, 어색하고 부자연스러운 문장을 자연스럽게 다듬고 더 효과적인 표현을 제안하는 매우 유용한 기능입니다.\n어조 변경: 텍스트의 분위기나 스타일을 손쉽게 조절하는 기능이에요. 슬라이더를 통해 글의 톤을 더 정중하게 또는 친근하게 즉시 변경할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 복잡한 재입력 없이 다양한 목적과 상황에 맞게 글을 빠르게 다듬을 수 있어요.\n길이 변경: Gemini를 포함한 대부분의 LLM에서는 글의 분량을 사용자가 원하는 수준으로 맞추지는 못하는데, 이때 이 기능이 도움이 됩니다. 하지만 LLM은 전체 길이를 계획하기보다 다음 내용을 예측하는 방식이라 정확한 분량 조절이 어려워요. 이 때문에 분량을 억지로 맞추면 내용이 반복되거나 부자연스러워질 수 있다는 점 참고하세요.\n작가의 말이 완성되면 이번엔 다음 챕터의 글을 작성합니다. 이 과정을 거쳐 수필 하나가 완성이 되는 거죠.\n  알아두세요!\n이번 지침은 Gemini뿐만 아니라 ChatGPT와 Claude의 프로젝트에서도 사용이 가능해요. 특히 Claude는 번역체가 아닌 자연스러운 한국어 구사와 맥락 이해 능력이 뛰어나 활용도가 높습니다. 긴 글을 쓸 때도 앞뒤 맥락을 잘 파악하고 일관된 논조를 유지하며, 공식적인 보고서부터 친근한 블로그 글까지 다양한 스타일에 맞춰 톤을 조절할 수 있죠. 한국 문화와 사회적 배경을 이해해서 독자가 공감할 수 있는 내용을 만드는 데 탁월합니다.\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약  \n이것으로 AI 맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침에 대한 강의를 마치도록 하겠습니다.\nAI 글쓰기는 이제 충분히 실용적인 수준에 도달했고, 적절한 방법만 알면 전자책 출판을 통해 실제 수익까지 낼 수 있다는 점 꼭 기억하세요! 특히 제가 소개해드린 '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침'은 체계적인 3단계 프로세스를 통해 여러분만의 전문적인 글쓰기 도구를 만들어주고, 자연스럽고 인간적인 글을 만들어낼 수 있게 해줍니다.\n이제 여러분도 바로 시작해보세요! 먼저 쓰고 싶은 글의 장르를 정하고, 오늘 배운 지침을 활용해서 여러분만의 맞춤형 프롬프트를 만들어보시기 바랍니다. 실제로 글을 써서 책으로 출간까지 도전해보세요! 내용에 소개된 정보들은 영상 설명란에 링크로 남겨두겠습니다. 구독과 좋아요, 알림 설정까지 부탁드리고요. 여러분 모두 성공적인 작가가 되시길 바라면서, 오늘 강의 여기서 마치겠습니다. 감사합니다!  \n \n \nAI 글쓰기 핵심 요약\n✨ 첫 번째 핵심: AI 글쓰기 실력 향상: 최신 AI는 전문 작가 수준의 글을 생성하며, 속도, 일관성, 아이디어 생성, 다양한 장르 대응이 강점입니다.\n  두 번째 핵심: 전자책 출판으로 수익 창출: 개인 출판 시장은 진입장벽이 낮고 인세율이 높아, AI로 쓴 글로도 충분히 수익을 낼 수 있습니다.\n  세 번째 핵심: '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침':\n이 지침은 3단계 체계적 과정(장르 선택 → 요구사항 수집 → 맞춤형 프롬프트 생성)을 통해 AI의 단점을 최소화하고 장점을 극대화합니다.\n ‍  네 번째 핵심: 인간적 글쓰기 & 세계관 구축: AI 검출 회피를 위한 인간적인 글쓰기 원칙과 자동 세계관 구축, 시각적 마인드맵 기능으로 글의 완성도를 높입니다.\n지금 바로 여러분만의 AI 글쓰기 시스템을 구축하고, 작가의 꿈을 실현해보세요!\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: AI가 쓴 글은 사람이 쓴 글과 구별할 수 있나요?\nA: 최근 AI 글쓰기 실력이 크게 향상되어 전문가도 구분하기 어려운 경우가 많습니다. 하지만 '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침'에 포함된 인간적 글쓰기 원칙을 활용하면 AI 검출을 회피할 확률이 높아집니다.\nQ: AI로 쓴 전자책으로 실제로 수익을 낼 수 있나요?\nA: 네, 가능합니다! 교보문고 POD 바로출판, 부크크, 유페이퍼, 이퍼플 등 다양한 개인 출판 플랫폼을 통해 높은 인세율로 전자책을 출간하고 수익을 창출할 수 있습니다.\nQ: '맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침'은 어떻게 사용하나요?\nA: 3단계 과정으로 진행됩니다. 먼저 원하는 장르를 선택하고, 독자 분석, 목표 설정 등 8가지 구체적인 요구사항을 입력합니다. 이 정보들을 바탕으로 맞춤형 프롬프트가 생성됩니다.\nQ: 세계관 구축 기능이 글쓰기에 어떻게 도움이 되나요?\nA: 세계관은 글의 일관성과 논리성을 확보하고, 독자의 몰입감을 높이는 데 필수적입니다. 이 지침은 문학/비문학 장르에 맞춰 필요한 세계관 요소를 자동으로 구축해주고, 이를 시각적 마인드맵으로 제공하여 창작 효율성을 극대화합니다.\nQ: ChatGPT, Claude 같은 다른 AI 도구와도 호환되나요?\nA: 네, 이 지침은 Gemini 외에도 ChatGPT와 Claude 등 다양한 LLM에서 활용 가능합니다. 특히 Claude는 자연스러운 한국어 구사와 맥락 이해 능력이 뛰어나 활용도가 높습니다.\nGEM 지침 다운로드\n\n    \n\n    \n맞춤형 글쓰기 프롬프트 생성 지침.zip\n0.01MB",

        "contentSnippet": "Deep Research, 이제 최신 정보까지!   ChatGPT의 한계를 넘어선 Scholar GPT로 더욱 스마트한 연구를 경험하세요.\n\n\n \n 혹시 ChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구를 써보셨나요? 정말 유용하지만, 가끔 최신 정보를 찾는 데 아쉬움을 느꼈던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아니겠죠? 저는 이 부분이 항상 아쉬웠어요. 특히 정보의 신선함이 중요한 연구나 빠르게 변화하는 분야에서는 더욱 그렇고요. 그런데 말이죠, 이 갈증을 시원하게 해결해 줄 'Scholar GPT'라는 커스텀 GPT를 최근에 발견했지 뭐예요!  \n \n최신 정보, 이젠 문제없어요!  \n제가 처음 ChatGPT의 Deep Research를 사용했을 때, 여러 범주에서 도구를 테스트해봤어요. 다양한 범주에서 Copilot의 동등 기능보다 뛰어났지만, 최신 정보를 찾는 데 있어서는 고전했습니다. 대부분의 경우 2년 이내의 관련 정보를 찾기 어려웠고, 이는 도구를 사용하는 목적을 무의미하게 만들었습니다.\n하지만 Scholar GPT는 훨씬 더 최신 정보를 잘 찾아줍니다. 예를 들어, \"지난 6개월간 발표된 인공지능 기반 질병 진단 최신 연구 논문 5편을 찾아줘. 각 논문의 핵심 요약과 PubMed 또는 arXiv 링크를 함께 제공해 줘.\"라고 요청하면 사실들의 정리된 목록과 함께 원본 링크도 제공합니다. 이를 통해 정보를 정리하기 매우 쉬워집니다. 때로는 원본 자료 링크 없이 글머리표 형식의 목록만 받기도 하지만, 조금 더 아래로 스크롤하면 유용한 온라인 자료에 대한 링크를 찾을 수 있습니다. Scholar GPT의 테이블(표) 보기 방식은 모든 것을 쉽게 소화할 수 있는 형식으로 제시해 줍니다.\n\n\n  알아두세요!\nScholar GPT는 최신 연구 자료를 정리된 목록과 원본 링크와 함께 제공하여 정보 파악을 용이하게 합니다.\n \n복잡한 연구 문서도 한 번에 요약!  \n관련성 높고 시의적절한 정보를 찾는 것 외에도, Scholar GPT는 연구 문서를 읽고 그 결과를 요약할 수 있습니다. 이 기능은 짧은 문서에 특히 유용하며, 핵심 내용을 쉽게 파악할 수 있게 해 줍니다.\n더 좋은 건, 방대한 PDF 문서에도 유용하다는 점이에요. 예를 들어, \"첨부된 '지속 가능한 에너지 시스템 전환에 대한 글로벌 보고서.pdf'를 읽고, 주요 연구 결과와 보고서에서 제시하는 미래 전망에 대해 500자 내외로 요약해 줘.\"와 같이 문서를 업로드하면 간단한 개요를 제공해 줍니다. 핵심 결과 외에도, 이 도구는 균형 잡힌 시각을 제시하려 하며 \"상관관계가 인과관계인지\"에 대해 의문을 제기합니다. 초기 연구를 마친 뒤 Scholar GPT는 더 깊이 탐색할 기회를 제공하는데요. 예를 들어, 커스텀 GPT를 사용하여 마인드맵을 만들거나, 내용을 더 쉽게 설명해달라고 요청하거나, 동일 주제의 다른 연구 결과와 비교할 수 있습니다. 각 문서마다 이를 반복해서 적용할 수 있으며, 이후에 모든 아이디어를 통합하여 더 효과적으로 학습할 수 있습니다.\nScholar GPT 문서 요약 기능 비교\n구분\nDeep Research\nScholar GPT\n특징\n\n\n\n\n최신 정보 탐색\n2년 이내 정보 제한적\n매우 뛰어남 (정리된 목록, 원본 링크 제공)\n정보 신선도와 접근성 우위\n\n\n연구 문서 요약\n간단한 개요 제공\n핵심 결과 요약, 비판적 시각 제공\n심층 분석 및 균형 잡힌 정보 제공\n\n\n학습 전략\n제공 기능 제한적\n마인드맵, 쉬운 설명, 비교 분석 등 다양\n개인화된 학습 경험 지원\n\n\n링크 분석\n실패 사례 빈번\n뛰어난 성능 (개요, 비판적 분석, 대안 제시)\n정확하고 다각적인 관점 제공\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nScholar GPT는 학문적 연구에 매우 강력하지만, 쇼핑 추천이나 일상적인 정보 탐색에는 Deep Research가 더 유용할 수 있습니다. 각 도구의 장점을 이해하고 목적에 맞게 활용하는 것이 중요해요!\n \n링크 분석도 똑똑하게!  \n저는 예전부터 ChatGPT에 링크를 업로드해서 읽게 할 때 실패하는 경우가 많아서, 그냥 파일을 업로드하는 걸 선호했어요. 그런데 Scholar GPT는 이 부분에서 꽤 좋은 성능을 보여줍니다. 링크를 업로드하기 전에 챗에 \"링크를 공유할 예정\"이라고 미리 알릴 수 있습니다.\n\n\n그러면 Scholar GPT는 제가 특정 주제를 탐색하고 싶은지 물어보며, 원한다면 해당 주제를 입력하라고 안내합니다. 예를 들어, \"이 링크에 있는 기사를 읽고, 데이터 프라이버시 침해 사례와 그에 대한 법적 대응 방안을 중심으로 분석해 줘. 또한, 해당 기사에 대한 비판적인 관점이나 추가적으로 고려해야 할 대안적 관점이 있다면 함께 제시해 줘.\"와 같이 구체적으로 요청하여 더 정확한 답변을 얻을 수 있으며, 나중에 수정을 해야 할 필요도 줄어듭니다. 링크를 업로드하면 Scholar GPT는 해당 페이지나 문서를 읽고, 가장 중요한 개념에 대한 개요를 제공합니다. 제시 방식이 훌륭하고, 추가 정보가 필요할 경우 후속 질문도 할 수 있습니다.\n개인적으로 Scholar GPT에게 링크 분석을 요청할 때는 \"비판적 분석\"과 \"대안적 관점 생성\"을 요청하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 더 균형 잡힌 시각을 얻을 수 있고, 논문이 편향되어 보일 경우에도 보다 합리적인 학습이 가능합니다.\n  알아두세요!\n링크 분석 시 비판적 분석과 대안적 관점 생성을 함께 요청하면, 정보의 편향성을 줄이고 균형 잡힌 시각을 얻는 데 도움이 됩니다.\n \n나만의 연구 비서, Scholar GPT!  ‍ ‍ \n연구 논문을 읽고 요약해 주는 것 외에도 Scholar GPT는 전반적인 연구 능력 향상에도 도움을 줍니다. 예를 들어, 학습 능력을 향상시키는 방법에 대해 더 깊이 이해하고자 할 때 사용할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n초기 프롬프트로 다음과 같이 입력할 수 있습니다: \"내가 '비판적 읽기 능력'을 향상시키고 싶어. Scholar GPT에 내장된 비판적 읽기 훈련 기능을 보여줄 수 있을까?\". 그러면 Scholar GPT는 여러 가지 비판적 읽기 방법을 제시하고, 각 방법에 대한 간단한 설명도 제공합니다. 이어서 다음과 같이 후속 질문을 할 수 있습니다: \"제시된 비판적 읽기 방법 중 '스키밍(Skimming)'에 대해 더 자세히 알려줄 수 있니? 구체적인 활용법과 예시를 들어 설명해 줘.\". 그러면 GPT는 더 포괄적인 개요를 제공하며, 연습 과제도 수행할 수 있습니다. 이는 학교에서 ChatGPT를 가장 잘 활용하는 방법 중 하나입니다.\n  알아두세요!\nScholar GPT는 단순 정보 제공을 넘어, 비판적 읽기 능력 향상과 같은 실질적인 연구 스킬 개발에도 도움을 줍니다.\n \n나만의 연구 전략, 함께 세워봐요!  \n일반적인 학습 프레임워크를 따라 할 수는 있지만, 모든 프레임워크가 자신에게 맞는 것은 아니죠. 따라서 보다 전략적으로 접근해 본인에게 맞는 방식을 찾아야 합니다. Scholar GPT는 이 과정을 도와줄 수 있습니다. 다음과 같은 프롬프트를 입력하면 됩니다: \"내 석사 논문 주제인 '도시 열섬 현상이 기후 변화에 미치는 영향'에 대한 연구를 시작하려고 해. 가장 효율적인 연구 전략 3가지를 간단한 설명과 함께 알려줘.\".\n\n\n그러면 Scholar GPT는 목록을 제공합니다. 이후에는 특정 전략을 개발하는 데 도움을 요청할 수 있습니다. 이때 포괄적인 개요를 받아본 후, 필요에 따라 맞춤화하여 활용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, \"제시된 전략 중 '질문 기반 연구(Inquiry-Based Research)'를 제 석사 논문 주제인 '기후 변화가 도시 생태계에 미치는 영향'에 적용하여 구체적인 연구 계획을 세우는 데 도움을 줄 수 있을까?\"와 같이 구체적으로 요청하여 정말 저만의 연구 코치를 둔 것 같은 기분이었어요!\n사례: A 학생의 연구 전략 수립 과정\n초기 고민: 연구 자료가 너무 많아 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 막막함.\nScholar GPT 활용 프롬프트: \"일반적인 연구 전략 3가지 알려줘\"\n개선 과정: 전략 맞춤화\n1) Scholar GPT가 제시한 전략 중 '핵심 개념 지도화' 선택.\n2) 후속 프롬프트: \"핵심 개념 지도화 전략을 내 논문 주제인 'AI 윤리'에 맞게 구체화해줘.\"\n최종 결과: 맞춤형 연구 전략\n- 개념 매핑: AI 윤리 관련 핵심 용어(편향, 투명성, 책임) 정의 및 관계 시각화.\n- 자료 분류: 각 용어별 최신 연구 논문, 법규, 실제 사례 분류 및 연결.\n이처럼 Scholar GPT를 활용하면 막연했던 연구 과정을 나에게 최적화된 전략으로 구체화하고 효율적으로 진행할 수 있어요. 정말 똑똑한 연구 파트너죠!\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약  \n지금까지 Scholar GPT가 ChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구를 어떻게 보완하고 능가하는지 자세히 알아봤는데요. 제가 직접 사용해보니 Scholar GPT는 정말 유용한 기능이 많고, 특히 최신 연구 자료를 찾거나 심도 있는 학습 전략을 개발하는 데 탁월한 성능을 보여줬어요. 학문적 연구를 하는 입장에서는 Scholar GPT가 Deep Research보다 훨씬 뛰어나다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있습니다. 더 정확하고 빠른 정보 탐색이 가능하니까요!\n물론, 쇼핑 추천이나 일상적인 정보 탐색 같은 목적이라면 여전히 ChatGPT의 Deep Research도 충분히 매력적인 도구예요. Scholar GPT가 연구 논문을 읽는 데 더 특화되어 있다면, Deep Research는 좀 더 일반적인 정보 탐색에 강점을 보인다고 할 수 있습니다. 그러니까, 여러분의 목적에 맞게 두 가지 도구를 적절히 활용한다면 정말 스마트하고 효율적인 정보 탐색을 할 수 있을 거예요! 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요~  \n \n \nScholar GPT, 핵심 요약!\n✨ 최신 정보 탐색: Deep Research보다 훨씬 뛰어남! 정리된 목록과 원본 링크까지 제공해요.\n  연구 문서 요약: 방대한 PDF도 OK! 핵심 결과뿐만 아니라 비판적 시각까지 제시해 줍니다.\n  링크 분석 성능:\n성공률 ⬆️ (이젠 링크도 자신있게!) ➡️ 비판적/대안적 관점 분석 요청으로 더 풍부한 인사이트 확보 가능!\n ‍  연구 능력 향상: 맞춤형 학습 전략과 비판적 읽기 스킬까지 도와주는 스마트한 연구 비서!\n학문적 연구에는 Scholar GPT, 일상 정보 탐색에는 Deep Research! 목적에 맞게 활용하는 것이 중요합니다.\n \n ✨ Scholar GPT 바로가기 ✨ \n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Scholar GPT는 Deep Research의 완전한 대체재인가요?\nA: 아니요!

        "contentSnippet": "ChatGPT, 당신의 똑똑한 비서일까, 아니면 착각의 시작일까? 일상에서 ChatGPT를 현명하게 사용하는 비법과 주의할 점을 현직 전문가가 솔직하게 파헤쳐 봅니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 인터넷을 보면 온통 ChatGPT 이야기뿐이에요. “ChatGPT가 몇 년간 해결 못한 문제를 단번에 풀어줬다”는 둥, “누가 질문했는데, 진짜 기가 막힌 해답을 줬다”는 둥, 심지어 “공부, 글쓰기, 상담, 여행 계획까지 다 되더라!”는 과장된(?) 이야기까지 심심치 않게 들려오죠. 솔직히 이런 얘기들, 과장된 부분도 있지만 사실이기도 해요. 저도 의료 현장에서 일하는 전문가로서, 의학 분야는 물론이고 일상생활의 다양한 문제 해결에 ChatGPT를 직접 활용해보면서 그 잠재력을 충분히 느꼈거든요. \n그런데 문제는… 너무 많은 사람들이 이 도구의 한계 없이 맹신하고 있다는 겁니다. 제가 이 글을 쓰는 이유도 여기에 있어요. 일반인들이 ChatGPT를 잘 활용하기 위한 현실적인 기준선을 공유하고, 진짜 스마트한 사용자가 될 수 있도록 돕고 싶었거든요.\n \n✅ ChatGPT가 빛을 발하는 상황들\n제 경험상, ChatGPT가 진짜 유용하게 느껴지는 순간들이 있습니다. 특히 아래와 같은 상황에서는 ‘이거 진짜 물건이다!’ 싶을 때가 많아요.\n1. 이미 아는 내용을 정리하거나 확장하고 싶을 때 \n“내가 아는 이 개념, 혹시 내가 놓친 부분은 없을까?”, “이 아이디어, 다른 분야에선 어떻게 접근할까?”, “기존 정보를 쉽게 요약해줄 수 있을까?” 이런 식으로 내가 어느 정도 지식을 가지고 있는 상태에서 ChatGPT를 활용하면 정말 강력한 보조 도구가 됩니다.\n예를 들어, 요리 재료의 대체재를 찾거나, 영어 문장을 더 자연스럽게 고치거나, 내가 쓴 자기소개서를 더 깔끔하게 다듬을 때 말이죠. 이미 알고 있는 내용을 검토하거나 보완할 땐 ChatGPT가 최고 수준의 조력자라고 생각합니다.\n2. 정보량이 많고 정형화된 분야에선 더 유용해요 \nChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습되었기 때문에, 문헌이 잘 정리된 분야에서는 특히 정확도가 매우 높습니다. 제가 직접 써보니 진짜 편하더라고요.\n“파리에서 3일간 여행 일정 어떻게 짜야 할까?”\n“엑셀에서 특정 셀에 따라 색깔 바꾸는 조건부 서식은 어떻게 해?”\n“내가 만든 비즈니스 아이디어, 간단한 SWOT 분석 해줘.”\n이처럼 여행 계획, IT 툴 사용법, 기본적인 경영 지식, 글쓰기, 언어 학습 등 객관적이고 이미 체계화된 정보에 대해서는 정말 유용하게 작동합니다. 이건 진짜 인정입니다!\n3. ‘준비용 도구’로 활용할 때 정말 유용해요 \nChatGPT는 “정답”을 주는 도구라기보다는, “정리”와 “준비”에 강한 도구입니다. 이 점을 잘 활용하면 정말 좋아요.\n인터뷰 보기 전에 연습 질문 만들기\n발표 전에 흐름 잡기\n자기소개서 초안 잡기\n상담 받기 전에 나의 고민 정리하기\n즉, 생각을 말로 풀기 어렵거나, 복잡한 내용을 정리할 때 활용하면 빛을 발하죠. 저도 덕분에 여러 번 도움을 받았습니다.\n \n⚠️ ChatGPT를 쓸 때 조심해야 할 상황들\n아무리 똑똑한 ChatGPT라도 만능은 아닙니다. 오히려 잘못 사용하면 독이 될 수 있는 상황들도 분명히 존재해요. 제가 경험하며 느낀 점들을 솔직히 말씀드릴게요.\n1. 중요한 정보를 빼놓고 질문했을 때 \nChatGPT는 기본적으로 제가 입력한 정보만 가지고 답을 합니다. 그니까요, 내가 중요한 사실을 빼먹으면, 엉뚱하거나 틀린 답을 줄 수도 있다는 거죠. 너무 당연한 얘기 같지만, 의외로 많은 분들이 이걸 간과해요.\n예를 들어, “퇴사하고 싶은데 어떻게 해야 하나요?”라고 물었는데, ‘이미 다른 일자리 제안도 있고, 상사와의 갈등도 심하다’는 중요한 정보를 빼먹었다고 해봅시다. 그럼 GPT는 아주 일반적인 퇴사 절차나 장단점만 말할 거예요. 실제 나에게는 전혀 도움이 안 되는 정보가 될 수 있다는 거죠. 정확한 답을 원한다면, 질문도 그만큼 정확하고 구체적이어야 합니다. 정보가 부족하면, 그냥 엉뚱한 답을 받게 되는 거예요.\n2. 내가 원하는 방향으로 ‘유도 질문’할 때 \n사람은 누구나 듣고 싶은 말을 듣고 싶어 하는 본능이 있잖아요? 그래서 ChatGPT에게도 자기도 모르게 “유도 질문”을 하게 되는 경우가 정말 많아요.\n❌ “이런 상황이면 그 사람이 나쁜 거 맞죠?”\n❌ “제가 그만두는 게 정답이겠죠?”\n이렇게 묻는 순간, ChatGPT는 여러분의 생각을 그럴듯하게 합리화해 줄 가능성이 높아요. 제 경험상 진짜 그랬어요. 하지만 그게 과연 진짜 진실일까요? 아닐 수도 있습니다. 답을 강요하지 말고, 항상 열린 질문을 던지세요. “이런 상황에서는 어떤 선택지가 있을까요?”, “장단점을 비교해줄 수 있나요?” 이렇게요!\n3. 전문적인 판단이 필요한 영역에서는 무조건 조심!  \nChatGPT는 분명 똑똑하지만, ‘판단’은 못 합니다. 그냥 학습된 데이터를 기반으로 확률적으로 가장 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 뿐이죠. 특히 아래와 같은 분야에서는 무조건 사람 전문가와 상의해야 해요.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n법률 상담: 상황 설명이 주관적이면, 편향되거나 잘못된 조언이 나올 수 있습니다.\n의료 정보: ChatGPT는 진단 도구가 아닙니다. 단지 “가능성”을 말할 뿐이니, 건강 문제는 무조건 전문가와 상담하세요.\n재무·투자: 시장의 실시간 변화나 개인의 복잡한 재무 상황을 정확히 반영하지 못할 수 있습니다.\n정말 중요한 결정이 필요한 순간이라면 반드시 사람 전문가와 상의하세요. ChatGPT는 보조 도구일 뿐이지, 절대 책임지는 도구가 아닙니다.\n \n  현명하게 활용하는 방법 요약 \n자, 그럼 이쯤에서 ChatGPT를 어떻게 하면 더 현명하고 똑똑하게 활용할 수 있을지 핵심만 쏙쏙 뽑아 다시 한번 정리해 드릴게요.\n상황\nChatGPT 활용 팁\n\n\n\n\n정보 정리 및 확장\n내가 아는 내용을 요약하거나, 복잡한 개념을 쉽게 풀어서 정리할 때 사용해요. 이미 기반 지식이 있을 때 활용하면 좋아요.\n\n\n준비 활동\n면접, 상담, 발표, 병원 방문 전 내 생각을 정리하거나 연습 질문을 만들 때 정말 유용해요. 초안 잡기 최고!\n\n\n학습 보조\n모르는 개념을 쉽게 풀어서 설명해달라고 요청할 수 있어요. 단, 얻은 정보는 반드시 다른 신뢰할 수 있는 출처로 검증해야 합니다.\n\n\n아이디어 발전\n글쓰기 초안, 기획서의 큰 그림 잡기, 마케팅 문구의 여러 가지 버전을 만들 때 아이디어 생성 도구로 활용하면 좋아요.\n\n\n주관적 문제\n감정이 섞인 판단이나 개인적인 결정을 내릴 때는 GPT의 ‘말’을 맹신하지 말고, 항상 ‘객관식’처럼 여러 선택지를 물어보고 스스로 판단하세요.\n\n\n\n \n마무리: ChatGPT를 똑똑하게 쓰는 사람 \n결론적으로, ChatGPT는 여러분을 도와줄 수 있는 뛰어난 비서이자 보조 도구입니다. 하지만 절대 멘토, 의사, 변호사, 심리 상담사 그 자체는 아니라는 점을 꼭 기억해야 해요.\n정보를 찾을 땐 가능한 한 객관적이고 구체적으로 질문하는 연습을 하고, 무엇보다도 자신의 생각을 검토하고 정리하는 도구로써 활용하면 이보다 더 좋은 AI 파트너는 없을 겁니다. ChatGPT를 똑똑하게 쓰는 사람, 그게 결국 스마트한 시대의 진짜 고수가 아닐까요? 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든 댓글로 물어봐주세요~ \n \n \nChatGPT 현명하게 활용하기 핵심 요약\n✨ 활용의 시작: 기존 지식 정리 및 확장에 최적화된 도구입니다.\n  강점 분야: 정보량이 많고 정형화된 분야에서 특히 강력한 성능을 발휘합니다.\n  핵심 역할:\nAI는 '정답' 아닌 '준비 & 정리' 도구!\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 정보 부족/유도 질문/전문적 판단 요구 시 오작동 가능성이 높습니다.\nChatGPT는 훌륭한 비서지만, 최종 판단은 언제나 여러분의 몫입니다!\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: ChatGPT가 제 직업을 대체할 수도 있을까요?\nA:   ChatGPT는 특정 업무의 효율성을 높이는 데 도움을 줄 수 있지만, 인간의 창의적 사고, 공감 능력, 윤리적 판단 등을 대체하기는 어렵습니다. 오히려 AI를 활용해 업무 역량을 강화하는 방향으로 나아가는 것이 중요합니다.\nQ: ChatGPT가 알려준 정보가 정확한지 어떻게 알 수 있나요?\nA:   ChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습하지만, 최신 정보나 특정 분야의 심층적인 내용은 오류가 있을 수 있습니다. 반드시 교차 검증을 통해 신뢰할 수 있는 다른 출처(전문 서적, 공신력 있는 웹사이트 등)와 비교하여 확인하는 것이 중요해요.\nQ: ChatGPT에게 개인 정보를 입력해도 괜찮을까요?\nA:   어떤 AI 서비스든 민감한 개인 정보(주민등록번호, 계좌 정보, 건강 정보 등)는 입력하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 입력된 정보가 어떻게 활용되고 저장될지 명확하지 않을 수 있으니 항상 주의해야 해요.\nQ: ChatGPT를 활용하면 글쓰기 능력이 떨어지지 않을까요?\nA:   오히려 글쓰기 능력을 향상시킬 수 있는 좋은 도구가 될 수 있습니다. 초안 작성, 문맥 교정, 다양한 표현 학습 등에 활용하여 글쓰기 보조 도구로 사용하면 좋습니다. 다만, 맹목적으로 의존하기보다는 스스로 생각하고 다듬는 과정을 거쳐야 합니다.\nQ: ChatGPT를 어떤 질문에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\nA:   ‘정답’이 정해져 있는 사실 기반의 질문, 아이디어 발상, 정보 요약, 글 초안 작성 등 비교적 객관적이고 광범위한 질문에 효과적입니다. 개인의 주관적인 판단이나 감정적인 조언이 필요한 질문보다는 정보 검색 및 정리에 집중하는 것이 좋습니다.\n\n\n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT가 제 직업을 대체할 수도 있을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ChatGPT는 특정 업무의 효율성을 높이는 데 도움을 줄 수 있지만, 인간의 창의적 사고, 공감 능력, 윤리적 판단 등을 대체하기는 어렵습니다. 오히려 AI를 활용해 업무 역량을 강화하는 방향으로 나아가는 것이 중요합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT가 알려준 정보가 정확한지 어떻게 알 수 있나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습하지만, 최신 정보나 특정 분야의 심층적인 내용은 오류가 있을 수 있습니다. 반드시 교차 검증을 통해 신뢰할 수 있는 다른 출처(전문 서적, 공신력 있는 웹사이트 등)와 비교하여 확인하는 것이 중요해요.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT에게 개인 정보를 입력해도 괜찮을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  어떤 AI 서비스든 민감한 개인 정보(주민등록번호, 계좌 정보, 건강 정보 등)는 입력하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 입력된 정보가 어떻게 활용되고 저장될지 명확하지 않을 수 있으니 항상 주의해야 해요.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT를 활용하면 글쓰기 능력이 떨어지지 않을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  오히려 글쓰기 능력을 향상시킬 수 있는 좋은 도구가 될 수 있습니다. 초안 작성, 문맥 교정, 다양한 표현 학습 등에 활용하여 글쓰기 보조 도구로 사용하면 좋습니다. 다만, 맹목적으로 의존하기보다는 스스로 생각하고 다듬는 과정을 거쳐야 합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT를 어떤 질문에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ‘정답’이 정해져 있는 사실 기반의 질문, 아이디어 발상, 정보 요약, 글 초안 작성 등 비교적 객관적이고 광범위한 질문에 효과적입니다. 개인의 주관적인 판단이나 감정적인 조언이 필요한 질문보다는 정보 검색 및 정리에 집중하는 것이 좋습니다.\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }",

Poe는 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해줍니다. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 같은 쟁쟁한 AI 모델들을 하나의 인터페이스에서 자유롭게 이용할 수 있거든요. 코딩이 필요할 때는 GPT-4를, 창의적인 글쓰기를 할 때는 Claude를 선택하는 식으로, 작업의 성격에 맞춰 최적의 모델을 고를 수 있다는 게 정말 큰 장점이에요. 단일 모델만 제공하는 ChatGPT와는 확실히 다른 부분이죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 Poe에는 Poe 자체 모델은 물론, 우리 같은 사용자들이 직접 만든 특화된 봇들도 많아서 활용도가 무궁무진해요. 마치 나만의 AI 비서들을 여럿 데리고 다니는 느낌이랄까? 단순한 대화형 AI를 넘어, 목적에 딱 맞는 도구로 진화한 거죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  알아두세요!</b><br />Poe는 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에 모아두어, 필요에 따라 모델을 바꾸거나 비교하면서 사용할 수 있는 환경을 제공해요. 최신 모델들을 바로바로 경험해 볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 매력이죠!</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>텍스트를 넘어, 멀티모달 AI의 자유로움  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Poe의 진짜 강점은 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">&lsquo;통합성&rsquo;</span>이에요. 웹사이트나 앱을 여러 개 켜놓고 이리저리 왔다 갔다 할 필요 없이, 모든 AI 모델을 한곳에서 쓸 수 있다는 게 너무 편하죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT와 Claude에 같은 질문을 던지고 어떤 답변이 더 좋은지 바로 비교해볼 수 있어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 Poe는 텍스트만 다루는 게 아니더라고요. Eleven Labs의 기술을 사용해서 AI의 답변을 자연스러운 음성으로 변환해 주거나, 심지어 다운로드도 할 수 있어요. 영상 생성까지 지원한다는 점은 정말 놀라웠죠. Sora, Kling, Runway 같은 최신 이미지&middot;비디오 생성 모델들을 활용해서 머릿속 아이디어를 눈 깜짝할 사이에 시각화할 수 있어요. 이 모든 기능이 하나의 구독으로 제공되니, 여러 유료 서비스에 따로 돈 낼 필요도 없고요!</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"poe.png\" data-origin-width=\"1486\" data-origin-height=\"900\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbGCcze%2FbtsPluQFTmy%2Ft73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"poe 화면\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1486\" height=\"900\" data-filename=\"poe.png\" data-origin-width=\"1486\" data-origin-height=\"900\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #dc3545; margin: 20px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>ChatGPT와 Poe, 무엇이 다를까?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">구분</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">ChatGPT Plus</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">Poe 프리미엄</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">특징</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용 모델</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">주로 OpenAI 모델 (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 등)</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama 등 다양</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">단일 모델 vs. 멀티 모델 지원</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">개인화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용자 정보 기반 지속적 개인화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">매 대화 초기화 (봇 제작 시 개인화 가능)</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">장기 기억 학습 여부</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">멀티모달 기능</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">일부 이미지 생성, 웹 브라우징 등</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">음성, 이미지, 비디오 생성 통합</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">지원하는 미디어 종류 및 통합성</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용량 제한</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">정액제 기반, 일정량 이상 사용 가능</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">포인트 소모, 과도한 사용 시 일시 제한</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">합리적 사용량 관리의 중요성</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>⚠️ 주의하세요!</b><br />Poe는 강력하지만, 프리미엄 모델 사용 시 포인트를 소모하는 방식이에요. 무제한 사용이 아닌 만큼, 계획적으로 사용하는 것이 중요하겠죠?</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>나만의 AI 봇 만들기: 상상력을 현실로&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Poe는 그냥 여러 AI를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">'나만의 AI 봇'을 직접 만들고 공유</span>할 수 있는 기능을 제공해요. 처음엔 '내가 뭘 만든다고?' 싶었는데, 막상 해보니 정말 재밌더라고요. 글쓰기 도우미, 언어 튜터, 심지어 특정 롤플레잉 파트너까지, 나만의 목적에 딱 맞는 맞춤형 봇을 만들어서 활용할 수 있어요.

        "contentSnippet": "ChatGPT에서 Poe로 전환을 검토해도 좋은 이유 ✨ 끊임없이 발전하는 AI 세상에서, 단 하나의 도구만 고집할 필요는 없죠. 이 글에서 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에서 만날 수 있는 Poe로 전환을 고민해봐도 좋을 이유를 알려드릴게요!\n\n\n \n 혹시 여러분도 ChatGPT만 사용하고 계신가요?  처음 Poe를 접했을 때, 저도 '또 다른 AI 서비스겠지 뭐' 하는 가벼운 마음이었어요. 그런데 막상 사용해보니, 텍스트부터 이미지, 오디오 작업까지 한 플랫폼에서 다 해결할 수 있다는 사실에 깜짝 놀랐지 뭐예요! 여러 AI 툴을 왔다 갔다 하던 번거로움을 확 줄여주는 느낌이랄까요? 그래서 오늘은 제가 왜 ChatGPT 외에 Poe도 함께 고려해볼 만한지, 그 이유들을 솔직하게 풀어볼까 합니다.\n \n하나의 플랫폼에서 다양한 AI 모델을 경험하다 \nChatGPT만 사용하다 보면, '다른 모델은 어떨까?' 하는 궁금증이 생길 때가 많잖아요. Poe는 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해줍니다. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 같은 쟁쟁한 AI 모델들을 하나의 인터페이스에서 자유롭게 이용할 수 있거든요. 코딩이 필요할 때는 GPT-4를, 창의적인 글쓰기를 할 때는 Claude를 선택하는 식으로, 작업의 성격에 맞춰 최적의 모델을 고를 수 있다는 게 정말 큰 장점이에요. 단일 모델만 제공하는 ChatGPT와는 확실히 다른 부분이죠.\n게다가 Poe에는 Poe 자체 모델은 물론, 우리 같은 사용자들이 직접 만든 특화된 봇들도 많아서 활용도가 무궁무진해요. 마치 나만의 AI 비서들을 여럿 데리고 다니는 느낌이랄까? 단순한 대화형 AI를 넘어, 목적에 딱 맞는 도구로 진화한 거죠.\n  알아두세요!\nPoe는 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에 모아두어, 필요에 따라 모델을 바꾸거나 비교하면서 사용할 수 있는 환경을 제공해요. 최신 모델들을 바로바로 경험해 볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 매력이죠!\n \n텍스트를 넘어, 멀티모달 AI의 자유로움  \nPoe의 진짜 강점은 ‘통합성’이에요. 웹사이트나 앱을 여러 개 켜놓고 이리저리 왔다 갔다 할 필요 없이, 모든 AI 모델을 한곳에서 쓸 수 있다는 게 너무 편하죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT와 Claude에 같은 질문을 던지고 어떤 답변이 더 좋은지 바로 비교해볼 수 있어요.\n게다가 Poe는 텍스트만 다루는 게 아니더라고요. Eleven Labs의 기술을 사용해서 AI의 답변을 자연스러운 음성으로 변환해 주거나, 심지어 다운로드도 할 수 있어요. 영상 생성까지 지원한다는 점은 정말 놀라웠죠. Sora, Kling, Runway 같은 최신 이미지·비디오 생성 모델들을 활용해서 머릿속 아이디어를 눈 깜짝할 사이에 시각화할 수 있어요. 이 모든 기능이 하나의 구독으로 제공되니, 여러 유료 서비스에 따로 돈 낼 필요도 없고요!\n\n\nChatGPT와 Poe, 무엇이 다를까? \n구분\nChatGPT Plus\nPoe 프리미엄\n특징\n\n\n\n\n사용 모델\n주로 OpenAI 모델 (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 등)\nGPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama 등 다양\n단일 모델 vs. 멀티 모델 지원\n\n\n개인화\n사용자 정보 기반 지속적 개인화\n매 대화 초기화 (봇 제작 시 개인화 가능)\n장기 기억 학습 여부\n\n\n멀티모달 기능\n일부 이미지 생성, 웹 브라우징 등\n음성, 이미지, 비디오 생성 통합\n지원하는 미디어 종류 및 통합성\n\n\n사용량 제한\n정액제 기반, 일정량 이상 사용 가능\n포인트 소모, 과도한 사용 시 일시 제한\n합리적 사용량 관리의 중요성\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nPoe는 강력하지만, 프리미엄 모델 사용 시 포인트를 소모하는 방식이에요. 무제한 사용이 아닌 만큼, 계획적으로 사용하는 것이 중요하겠죠?\n \n나만의 AI 봇 만들기: 상상력을 현실로 \nPoe는 그냥 여러 AI를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, '나만의 AI 봇'을 직접 만들고 공유할 수 있는 기능을 제공해요. 처음엔 '내가 뭘 만든다고?' 싶었는데, 막상 해보니 정말 재밌더라고요. 글쓰기 도우미, 언어 튜터, 심지어 특정 롤플레잉 파트너까지, 나만의 목적에 딱 맞는 맞춤형 봇을 만들어서 활용할 수 있어요. ChatGPT도 비슷한 기능을 시도하고 있지만, Poe는 접근성과 개방성 면에서 훨씬 더 자유로운 느낌이었어요.\n  알아두세요!\nPoe에서 자신만의 커스텀 봇을 만들면, 특정 작업에 최적화된 개인화된 AI 경험을 누릴 수 있어요. 심지어 만든 봇을 다른 사람들과 공유할 수도 있답니다!\n \n실전 예시: 시나리오 작가 J의 Poe 활용기 \n제가 시나리오 작가 친구 J에게 Poe를 추천해줬는데, 그 친구가 정말 유용하게 쓰고 있다고 해요. J의 이야기를 한번 들어볼까요?\n사례 주인공의 상황\nJ는 새로운 SF 시나리오를 구상 중인데, 복잡한 과학 기술 설정과 독특한 캐릭터 설정에 대한 아이디어가 필요했어요.\n기존에는 ChatGPT로 기본적인 아이디어를 얻고, 다른 이미지 생성 AI로 캐릭터와 배경 스케치를 해본 후, 또 다른 툴로 음성 대사를 더빙하는 등 여러 플랫폼을 오가며 작업해야 해서 시간 소모가 컸다고 해요.\nPoe 활용 과정\n1) 아이디어 브레인스토밍: Poe에서 GPT-4와 Claude를 동시에 사용해 시나리오 플롯, 기술 설정, 캐릭터 성격 등 다양한 아이디어를 비교하며 얻었어요.\n2) 시각화 및 음성화: 아이디어가 구체화되면, 바로 Poe 내에서 이미지 생성 모델(Sora 등)을 이용해 장면과 캐릭터의 시안을 만들고, Eleven Labs 음성 생성 기능을 활용해 주요 대사를 미리 들어보며 감정선을 조절했어요.\n최종 결과\n- 작업 효율 증대: 여러 툴을 전환하는 시간과 노력을 크게 줄여, 작업 속도가 2배 이상 빨라졌다고 해요.\n- 창의성 증폭: 다양한 AI 모델의 관점을 즉시 비교하고, 텍스트-이미지-음성으로 이어지는 통합 워크플로우 덕분에 아이디어를 더 풍부하게 발전시킬 수 있었다고 합니다.\nJ의 사례처럼, Poe는 여러 AI 모델과 멀티모달 기능을 통합하여 작업의 효율성과 창의성을 동시에 높여줄 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있어요. 특히 다양한 AI 기능을 유기적으로 연결하고 싶은 분들에게 정말 좋은 선택지가 될 것 같아요.\n \n마무리: Poe, 당신의 AI 활용을 한 단계 업그레이드할 기회 \n저는 처음엔 그저 여러 AI 모델을 비교해보고 싶다는 가벼운 마음으로 Poe를 시작했지만, 써보니 AI를 활용하는 방식 자체를 바꿔주는 경험이었어요. 필요한 기능을 마치 블록처럼 자유롭게 불러 쓸 수 있다는 점이 정말 효율적이었고요.\n특히 텍스트를 바로 이미지나 영상으로 변환하고, 다양한 모델의 해석을 비교하며 아이디어를 빠르게 구체화할 수 있다는 점에서 만족도가 높았습니다. 물론 ChatGPT는 여전히 강력한 도구이지만, 더 폭넓고 자유로운 AI 활용을 원한다면 Poe를 한번쯤 진지하게 고민해볼 가치가 충분하다고 생각해요. 여러분도 Poe와 함께 더 스마트하고 효율적인 AI 라이프를 경험해보시는 건 어떨까요? 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요~ \n \n \nPoe 전환, 왜 고민해야 할까?\n✨ 다양한 AI 모델 통합: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 등 여러 AI를 한곳에서! 목적에 맞는 최적의 모델을 선택할 수 있어요.\n  멀티모달 기능: 텍스트, 음성, 이미지, 영상 생성까지! 아이디어를 다양한 형태로 빠르게 구현해 보세요.\n  효율적인 워크플로우:\n여러 툴 전환 ✖️ → 하나의 플랫폼 ⭕️ = 작업 시간 단축 & 창의성 증대\n ‍  나만의 AI 봇 제작: 커스텀 봇으로 개인화된 AI 경험을 만들고 공유할 수 있어요.\n단일 AI 툴의 한계를 넘어, AI 활용의 폭을 넓히고 싶다면 Poe를 고려해보세요!\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Poe를 사용하면 ChatGPT는 더 이상 필요 없나요?\nA: 아니요!

        "pubDate": "Sun, 20 Jul 2025 23:13:22 GMT",
        "content": "[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_Obfuscation_202507-01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerObfuscation20250701.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)\r\r\n## 들어가며: 모바일 앱 난독화란?\r\r\n\r\r\n모바일 애플리케이션(이하 ‘앱’)은 사용자 데이터와 기업 지식 재산권을 보호하기 위한 강력한 보안 조치가 반드시 필요합니다. 특히, 인터넷을 통해 앱이 전 세계로 배포되면서 해커들의 공격 대상이 되기 쉬워졌습니다. 이러한 상황에서 **난독화(Obfuscation)**는 소스 코드나 바이너리 파일을 복잡하게 변환하여 역공학(逆工學, Reverse Engineering) 및 해킹 시도로부터 앱을 보호하는 핵심 기술로 자리 잡았습니다. 이 글에서는 모바일 환경에서 난독화의 중요성과 다양한 난독화 솔루션들이 제공하는 기능들을 살펴보겠습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 모바일 앱 난독화의 필요성\r\r\n\r\r\n**역공학**, 즉 **리버스 엔지니어링**은 모바일 앱 보안에 큰 위협이 됩니다. 해커들은 앱 코드를 분석해 작동 원리를 파악하고, 이를 통해 취약점을 찾아내거나 코드를 무단으로 변경할 수 있습니다. 악의적인 공격자들은 리버스 엔지니어링을 이용하여 앱의 핵심 로직을 탈취하거나, 유료 기능을 무료로 사용하도록 조작하며, 심지어 악성코드를 삽입해 사용자에게 피해를 줄 수도 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이러한 위협에 대응하기 위한 방법 중 하나가 바로 **난독화**입니다. 난독화는 앱의 코드를 읽기 어렵게 만들어 리버스 엔지니어링을 방해하는 기술로, 코드를 마치 암호처럼 복잡하게 변환하여 해커가 분석하기 어렵게 만듭니다. 이로 인해 공격자는 시간과 노력을 과도하게 소모하게 되어, 공격 시도를 크게 저지할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n난독화는 안티 디버깅, 안티 템퍼링, 무결성 검증과 같은 다른 보안 기술과 병행 사용될 때 그 효과가 더욱 극대화됩니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 난독화 기술의 종류\r\r\n\r\r\n「Parvez Faruki 외, (2026).

Android 앱에서는 주로 Java나 Kotlin 코드가, iOS 앱에서는 Objective-C 나 Swift 코드가 난독화 대상이 됩니다. 이 기술을 통해 해커가 코드에서 의미 있는 단어를 찾거나 앱의 기능을 파악하기 어렵게 만듭니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **장점**\r\r\n\r\r\n* 코드 가독성이 크게 낮아져 역공학 도구가 코드의 구조나 역할을 파악하기 어렵습니다.\r\r\n* 단순한 변환만으로도 상당한 보안 효과를 얻을 수 있어 초기 보안 강화 수단으로 효과적입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **단점**\r\r\n\r\r\n* 지나치게 난독화된 코드는 디버깅이나 유지보수가 어려워질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n* 코드 최적화와 충돌할 가능성이 있어 성능에 미치는 영향을 고려해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n**원본 코드**\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\npublic class UserData {\r\r\n  private String userName;\r\r\n  private String userPassword;\r\r\n\r\r\n  public String getUserName() {\r\r\n    return userName;\r\r\n  }\r\r\n\r\r\n  public void setUserPassword(String password) {\r\r\n    this.userPassword = password;\r\r\n  }\r\r\n}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n**난독화된 코드**\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\npublic class a {\r\r\n  private String b;\r\r\n  private String c;\r\r\n\r\r\n  public String a() {\r\r\n    return b;\r\r\n  }\r\r\n\r\r\n  public void b(String d) {\r\r\n    this.c = d;\r\r\n  }\r\r\n}\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### **Control Obfuscation**\r\r\n\r\r\nControl Obfuscation은 코드의 실행 경로와 제어 흐름을 복잡하게 변경하는 기술입니다. 조건문, 반복문, 분기문의 순서를 재구성하거나 불필요한 코드 조각을 삽입하여 실제 로직과 혼동을 유발합니다. 이러한 변환은 역공학 도구가 실제 실행 경로를 파악하는 데 많은 시간과 노력을 필요로 하게 만듭니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **예시**\r\r\n\r\r\n* 실제 로직과 무관한 조건문과 반복문을 추가해 제어 흐름을 복잡하게 만듭니다.\r\r\n* 함수 호출 순서를 임의로 변경하여 코드 흐름을 추적하기 어렵게 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **효과**\r\r\n\r\r\n* 공격자가 앱 내부의 실제 동작을 분석하는 데 소요되는 시간이 크게 증가합니다.\r\r\n* 역공학 도구를 이용한 자동 분석의 정확도를 낮춰 보안성을 극대화합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n대표적으로 Flattening 기법을 통해 이를 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n**원본 코드**\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\npublic class Calculator {\r\r\n    public int calculate(int a, int b) {\r\r\n        int result = a + b;\r\r\n        return result * 2;\r\r\n    }\r\r\n}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n**난독화된 코드**\r\r\n\r\r\n```java\r\r\npublic class Calculator {\r\r\n    public int calculate(int a, int b) {\r\r\n        int result = 0;\r\r\n        int state = 0;\r\r\n        int opaque = (a * b) % 2 + 1; // 항상 1 또는 2\r\r\n\r\r\n        while (opaque > 0) {\r\r\n            switch (state) {\r\r\n                case 0:\r\r\n                    result = a + b;\r\r\n                    state = opaque;     // 조건에 따라 1 또는 2로 전환\r\r\n                    break;\r\r\n                case 1:\r\r\n                    result = result * 2; // 곱셈 수행\r\r\n                    state = 3;          // 종료를 위해 3 부여\r\r\n                    break;\r\r\n                case 2: // 의미 없는 연산(dead code)\r\r\n                    result = b - a;\r\r\n                    state = 1;\r\r\n                    break;\r\r\n                case 3: // 종료\r\r\n                    opaque = -1;        // 루프 종료(실제로 불필요)\r\r\n                    break;\r\r\n            }\r\r\n            if (opaque < 0) break; // 더미 코드 및 탈출 조건\r\r\n        }\r\r\n        return result;\r\r\n    }\r\r\n}\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 시장에 존재하는 모바일 앱 난독화 솔루션\r\r\n\r\r\n모바일 난독화 솔루션은 무료와 상용 제품으로 구분됩니다. 각 솔루션은 기능, 사용 편의성, 그리고 업데이트 지원 측면에서 차이가 있으며, 개발자의 필요에 따라 선택할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### **무료 난독화 솔루션**\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **Proguard**\r\r\n\r\r\nProguard는 Android 개발 환경에서 가장 널리 사용되는 오픈 소스 난독화 도구입니다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "펀드레이징하는 창업가들이 가장 신경 써야 하는 건 바로 현실과 이상을 철저히 구분하는 것이다. 우리가 하는 일 중 가장 큰 비중을 차지하는 건 당연히 창업가들을 만나는 건데, 이 중 당장 투자유치를 하지 않는 분들도 있지만, 대부분 현재 펀드레이징 중이고, 스트롱에게 투자받기를 희망하는 창업가들이다. 우리도 워낙 많은 회사를 검토하고 투자 유치가 급한 회사들에 검토의 우선순위를 할당하면서 일을 쳐내기 때문에 항상 하는 질문 중 하나가 펀드레이징 타임라인이다. 즉, 이번 투자유치가 얼마나 급한가에 대한 질문이다. 우리가 긍정적으로 검토하는 회사인데, 현금이 아슬아슬해서 금방 런웨이가 끝나는 상황이면 우선순위를 높게 하고 검토한다. 또한, 다른 VC와도 이야기하고 있고, 몇몇 투자자들과의 대화가 깊게 진행되고 있다면, 이런 회사들도 우린 우선순위를 높게 하고 검토한다. 느낌이 좋은 창업가인데, 우리의 바쁜 상황 때문에 느리게 검토했다가 다른 VC에게 투자를 받고 라운드가 마무리되는 경우도 종종 있기 때문이다.\n그런데 내가 요새 아주 자주 느끼는 건, 상당히 많은 창업가들이 VC들의 의향에 대해서 착각하고, 현실을 똑바로 못 보고 본인들이 바라는 이상대로 생각하고 믿는다는 점이다.\n조금 더 구체적으로 이야기해 보면, 몇 달 전에 한 회사를 만났는데 꽤 괜찮다고 생각했다. 이 창업가에게 펀드레이징 타임라인에 대해서 물어보니, “최근에 XYZ 벤처스가 커밋했고, 3주 안으로 마무리한다고 이야기했습니다.”라고 해서 우리도 현재 검토하고 있는 다른 딜들을 일단 보류하고 이 딜을 먼저 검토하기로 했다. 그리고 이 창업가는 다른 VC들과 미팅하면서도 똑같은 이야기를 했던 걸로 알고 있다. 그런데 우연한 기회에 위에서 말 한 커밋했다는 투자사의 담당자를 만나서 자세한 이야기를 들어보니, 커밋은 커녕, 딜 검토를 진행할지 말지 결정도 안 했다고 한다. 그런데 어떻게 3주 안에 마무리한다는 이야기가 나왔는지 물어보니, 상당히 황당해하면서, 그건 그 VC의 일반적인 투자 프로세스에 관해 이야기한 건데, 대표이사가 철저하게 본인이 이해하고 싶은 데로 받아들인 것 같다고 했다.\n또 한가지 예는, 창업가는 그 투자 라운드에 여러 명의 VC가 커밋해서 이미 마무리 됐다고 하면서 스트롱이 들어 올 수 있는 룸이 없다고 하는데, 막상 커밋했다고 하는 VC들과 확인해 보면 몇 번 가볍게 미팅만 했지, 투자 한다고 커밋 한 적은 전혀 없다고 하는 경우도 있다. 역시 룸이 안 남았다고 우리에게 자랑스럽게 이야기 했던 창업가는 한 달 후에 다시 연락와서 펀드레이징을 처음부터 다시 시작한다고 했다.\n왜 이런 일이 있을까?\n창업가들이 현실을 제대로 보지 않고, 본인들이 믿고 싶고, 보고 싶은 이상만 봐서 그렇다. 그리고 이렇게 된 가장 큰 이유는 VC들을 잘 못 읽어서인 것 같다. VC들도 사람이라서 모두 다 성향, 인상, 태도, 어법, 표정 등이 다르고, 한 사람을 읽는 것도 어려운데, 이렇게 다양한 사람을 읽는다는 건 정말 어렵다. 두 사람이 같은 표정을 지으면서, 같은 말을 해도, 이들이 의도하는 건 완전히 반대인 경우도 있다. 특히, VC는 소위 말하는 어장 관리를 해야 하는 업종이라서 가끔 이들의 말을 들어보면 투자하겠다는 건지, 안 하겠다는 건지, 나도 헷갈리는 경우가 많다.\n그런데, 이들이 명확하게 이야기해도 창업가는 다르게 이해하는 경우도 많다. 내가 다수의 VC가 한 회사의 피칭을 듣는 자리에 참석했는데, 한 투자자가 이 회사에 특별한 애정을 보이면서, “우리는 10억까진 할 수 있고, 리드도 할 수 있다. 당장 내부에서 작업을 시작해 보겠다.”라는 말을 했다. 나도 아주 명확하게 들었다. 그런데 같은 창업가가 다른 자리에서 그 투자자가 10억을 커멋했다는 이야기를 하는 걸 나는 봤는데, 나중에 물어보니 이 창업가는 정말로 그때 들은 말이 회사에 10억을 투자하겠다는 뜻으로 이해했다고 한다. 어쩜 이렇게 현실을 제대로 못 보는지 이해할 수가 없었다.\nVC들을 잘 읽어서 현실과 이상을 명확하게 구분할 수 있는 가장 확실한 방법은 텀싯이다. 아무리 투자자들이 당신의 회사에 투자하고 싶다고 하고, 투자하겠다고 하고, 내부 투심에서 무조건 통과시키겠다고 해도, 텀싯을 주지 않으면, 그 VC는 투자하지 않는 거다. 이게 현실이다. 이미 커밋한 VC가 있다고 하는 창업가들에게 내가 항상 텀싯을 받았는지 물어보는데, 돌아오는 답변은 대부분 비슷하다. “아직 텀싯은 안 받았는데, 구두로 확실하게 한다고 했습니다.” , “원래 이 VC는 텀싯 없이 투자한다고 합니다.” 등의 답변인데, 이런 투자자들이 투자하는 걸 난 보지 못했다.\n간절하게 펀드레이징 하는 건 좋은 자세이다. 하지만, 현실과 이상은 명확하게 구분해야 한다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "바로 이전 포스팅에서 말했듯이, 나는 요새 기술이 아무리 발전하고, 세상이 바뀌더라도, 바뀌지 않는 것들에 대해 고민하고, 그쪽을 꽤 많이 보고 있다. 이렇게 조금 다른 각도로 시장을 보면, 잘 안 바뀌는 분야가 생각보다 많은데, 먹는 것, 바르는 것, 입는 것이 대표적이다. 아무리 터미네이터와 같은 휴머노이드가 길거리에 사람같이 돌아다녀도, 우린 계속 밥은 먹어야 하고, 얼굴과 몸에 뭔가를 발라야 하고, 계절에 맞는 옷을 입어야 한다. 몇 년 전에 DTC, 브랜드, 이커머스가 크게 유행하던 때가 있었고, 이때 엄청나게 많은 VC 돈이 이 분야에 투입됐는데, 돈 벌기가 너무 힘들다는 이유로 요샌 대부분의 VC에게 철저하게 외면당하고 있다.\n나는 이 분야가 돈 벌기가 힘든 이유는 너무 많은 플레이어가 비슷한 사업을 하고 있기 때문이지, 시장 자체가 돈을 못 버는 습성이 있기 때문은 절대로 아니라고 생각한다. 그리고 이런 논리로 시장과 회사에 접근하면, 그 어떤 분야에도 투자할 수가 없다. 이 세상에서 돈 벌기 쉬운 분야와 사업은 없기 때문이다.\n이런 요새 분위기와는 정반대로 우린 최근에 이 먹고 마시고, 바르고, 입는 분야에 꽤 활발하게 투자하고 있다. 소프트웨어 사업보다 성장의 기울기가 전반적으로 완만하고, 계속 뭔가를 만들어 팔아야 하므로 한계비용을 낮출 순 있어도 0으로 내릴 순 없고, 어느 정도 수준까지 도달하기 전에는 자본 집약적이라는 꼬리표를 피할 수 없지만, 그래도 손으로 만질 수 있는 제품을 만들어서 판매한다는 점에선 아주 단순하고, 아주 훌륭한 사업이라고 생각한다.\n2025년 1사분기에 유니콘이 된 Top 10 글로벌 신생 유니콘 중 7개가 AI 관련 스타트업인데, AI가 주 사업이 아닌 나머지 3개 중 유독 내 눈에 띈 회사는 OLIPOP이라는 미국의 프리바이오틱 음료수 회사다. 이 회사의 2023년 매출은 약 2,500억 원이고, 2024년 매출은 이보다 더 클 것이다. 유니콘 기업가치는 약 2.5조 원이었다. 매출의 10배 정도의 밸류에이션을 인정받은 건데, 이 배수는 내가 지난 몇 년 동안 봐왔던 먹고, 마시고, 입는 제품을 만드는 회사들의 기업가치와 어느 정도 비슷한 것 같고, 이 분야 스타트업의 성공을 위한 magic number는 연 매출 1,000억 원인 것 같다. 매출 1,000억 원을 하면 대부분 5,000억 원 이상의 기업가치에 투자를 받거나, 1조 원 이상의 기업가치에 더 큰 회사에 인수되는 사례를 최근 몇 년 동안 여러 번 봤기 때문이다.\n매출 1,000억 원은 어떤 의미일까?\n일단 엄청나게 큰 매출이다. 일반 사람들이 먹고 마시고 바르고 입는 제품의 단가가 그렇게 비싸지 않다는 걸 감안하면, 엄청나게 많이 팔아야지 매출 1,000억 원을 달성할 수 있다. 그리고 이 정도 매출을 하면 꽤 의미 있는 규모의 소비자들이 이 제품에 대해 이야기한다. 예를 들면, 프리바이오틱 소다에 대해 이야기하면 10명 중 4명은 위에서 말한 OLIPOP의 브랜드를 떠올릴 것이다.\n또한, 매출 1,000억 원을 해서 많은 사람들에게 회자되기 시작하면, 그 분야를 수십 년 ~ 수백 년 동안 장악하고 있는 공룡인 대기업들에게 조금씩 거슬리는 존재가 된다. 아직까진 경쟁사는 아니지만, 대기업이 뭐만 하려고 하면 이 작은 회사의 이름이 언급되면서 굉장히 불편하고 짜증 나는 존재로 강하게 인식되기 시작한다. 내가 이 블로그에서도 몇 번 언급했는데, 마하트가 간디의 명언 중 하나인, “처음엔 사람들이 당신을 무시할 것이고, 그다음엔 당신을 비웃을 것이고, 다음엔 당신과 싸울 것이고, 그러고 나서 당신은 이길 것이다”에서 대기업들이 1,000억 매출 하는 스타트업을 대하는 자세는 “다음엔 당신과 싸울 것이다” 바로 그 직전의 상태가 아닐까 싶다.\n그리고 대부분 이 시점에서 그 분야 1,2등 회사가 1,000억 원 매출의 대략 10배인 1조 원 정도의 가격에 회사를 인수한다. 이 정도까지 매출을 키운 브랜드라면, 대기업이 가진 자원과 유통 채널을 활용하면 장기적으론 이보다 훨씬 더 큰 브랜드로 성장시킬 수 있기 때문이다. 그리고 아마도 이게 가능하고, 정말로 인수 이후 훨씬 더 큰 브랜드가 되는 사례가 많은 이유는 먹고, 마시고, 바르고, 입는 산업에서는 유통이 가장 막강한 권력이고 큰 회사가 작은 회사보다 항상 잘하는 게 이 유통이기 때문이다.\n한국은 미국보다 시장이 작다. 많이 작다. 하지만, 이제 우리의 TAM(Total Addressable Market)은 한국의 5,000만 명의 잠재 소비자보다 훨씬 더 큰 글로벌 시장이다. 이미 한국이 만드는 먹는 것, 마시는 것, 바르는 것과 입는 것들은 해외 시장을 향해서 빠른 속도로 확장하고 있다. 이미 많이 있지만, 조만간 한국에도 매출 1,000억 원을 찍는 스타트업들이 더 많이 나오고, 더 많은 글로벌/한국 대기업들이 이 회사들을 높은 기업가치에 인수할 수 있길 바란다. 아니면, 스스로 계속 성장해서 이들이 대기업이 되고, 다른 스타트업을 높은 기업가치에 인수하고, 이 현상이 계속 반복될 수 있길 바란다.",

MVNO라는 어려운 용어 대신 누구나 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 친근한 이름을 붙인 거죠.\n요금이 합리적인 데는\n다 이유가 있어요\n같은 데이터를 쓰더라도 통신 3사보다 훨씬 저렴하게 이용할 수 있다는 게 알뜰폰의 가장 큰 장점이에요. 15GB 데이터를 기준으로 통신 3사의 요금은 보통 5만 원대인데, 알뜰폰은 1만 원대 초반까지도 가능해요. 실사용 기준으로 보면 많게는 세 배 넘게 차이 나는 셈이에요.\n이렇게 요금이 저렴한 이유는 명확합니다. 알뜰폰 사업자는 통신망을 직접 구축하지 않고, 통신 3사의 망을 빌려 써요. 대리점 대신 대부분 온라인으로 가입을 받고요. 설비나 인건비 같은 고정비가 적게 드니까, 요금도 낮아지는 구조예요.\n정부의 지원도 한몫하고 있어요. 과학기술정보통신부는 알뜰폰 경쟁력을 높이기 위해 도매대가*를 계속 낮춰 왔거든요. 덕분에 알뜰폰 사업자의 네트워크 비용 부담이 줄었고, 그만큼 더 저렴한 요금제가 만들어질 수 있었던 거죠.\n* 알뜰폰 사업자가 통신 3사에 지불하는 통신망 사용료\n알뜰폰은 요금제 선택지도 다양합니다. 데이터는 거의 안 쓰고 통화만 자주 하는 분, 하루 종일 유튜브 영상을 보는 분, 주로 와이파이 환경에서 최소 요금제로 쓰는 분 등. 각자의 사용 습관에 맞는 요금제를 고르면, 실제로 체감하는 통신비는 더 낮아질 수 있어요.\n통화 품질은 걱정마세요\n알뜰폰 가입을 망설이는 분들이 가장 많이 하는 질문 중 하나가 바로 통화 품질이에요. 요금이 저렴한 만큼 음질이 떨어지진 않을까 걱정되는 거죠. 하지만 이런 걱정은 하지 않으셔도 괜찮습니다. 알뜰폰은 통신 3사의 망을 그대로 빌려 쓰기 때문에, 통화 음질이나 데이터 속도, 연결 안정성 같은 핵심 품질은 사실상 동일해요.\n2024년 9월 한국소비자원이 발표한 조사에서는 통화 품질 만족도에서 알뜰폰이 더 높은 점수를 받기도 했어요. 통신 3사가 평균 3.67점을 받은 반면, 알뜰폰은 3.76점을 기록했거든요. 알뜰폰이 통화 품질 면에서 실사용자의 만족을 충분히 얻고 있다는 뜻이겠죠.\n아쉬움도 있어요\n알뜰폰은 통화 품질이나 데이터 속도 같은 기본적인 기능에서는 부족함이 없지만, 일부 부가서비스에서는 제한이 있을 수 있어요. 해외 로밍은 별도로 신청해야 할 수 있고, 실시간 사용량을 확인할 수 있는 앱이 없거나 특정 운영체제만 지원하는 경우도 있습니다. 고객센터 연결이 오래 걸리거나, 오프라인 대리점 수가 적어 긴급 상황에 대처하기 어려울 때도 있고요.\n이런 아쉬움을 줄이기 위해 많은 알뜰폰 사업자들이 서비스 품질을 빠르게 개선하고 있어요. 전용 앱으로 사용량을 확인하거나 요금제를 바꿀 수 있는 기능이 점점 더 정교해지고 있고, 챗봇이나 고객센터 상담도 더 편리해졌어요. 모바일 인증이나 통화 앱 연동처럼 일상적인 서비스도 대부분 문제없이 이용할 수 있도록 개선이 계속되고 있습니다.\n알뜰폰 가입자\n1,000만 시대\n통화 품질도 괜찮고, 요금도 합리적이라는 걸 알게 되었는데도 여전히 알뜰폰에 거리감이 느껴진다면, ‘왠지 나와는 안 어울릴 것 같은 느낌’ 때문일지도 몰라요.\n알뜰폰이 처음 도입되었을 땐 데이터를 많이 쓰지 않는 노년층을 중심으로 확산되면서 ‘알뜰폰=효도폰’ 같은 이미지가 생겼거든요. 서비스에 대해 잘 알지 못한 채 이런 인상이 먼저 떠오르면, 괜히 나와는 안 맞을 것 같다는 선입견이 생기기 쉬워요.\n하지만 지금은 달라졌습니다. 합리적인 소비를 중시하는 20~30대가 알뜰폰을 적극적으로 선택하면서 가입자 수는 1,000만 명을 앞두고 있어요. ‘알뜰폰은 똑똑하고 합리적인 요금제’라는 인식이 퍼지면서, 전체 이동통신 가입자의 약 17%가 알뜰폰을 쓰고 있을 만큼 이제는 누구에게나 익숙한 선택지가 됐습니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n통신비 줄이기\n이제 시작해봐요\n매달 빠져나가는 통신비는 은근히 부담되는 고정비 중 하나입니다. 익숙하기도 하고, 바꾸는 게 귀찮아서 기존 요금제를 계속 사용하고 계셨다면, 이번만큼은 알뜰폰 요금제를 제대로 살펴보세요. 알뜰폰은 더 이상 낯설고 불편한 서비스가 아닙니다. 많은 사람들이 알뜰폰 요금제로 바꾸고 통신비를 아끼고 있어요.\n물론, 알뜰폰 요금제 종류가 워낙 많다 보니 어떤 걸 골라야 할지 막막할 수 있어요.\n\n그럴 땐 토스의 ‘내게 맞는 요금제 찾기’ 기능을 이용해보세요. 원하는 월 요금이나 데이터 사용량 등을 선택하면 그에 맞는 다양한 요금제를 한눈에 비교할 수 있고, 마음에 드는 요금제가 있다면 바로 신청 할 수 있어요.\n통신비 아끼는 일은 생각보다 편하고 정말 쉽습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현 이동건",
