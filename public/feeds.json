        "content:encodedSnippet": "Data for Good at Meta is open-sourcing the data used to train our AI-powered population maps.\n We’re hoping that researchers and other organizations around the world will be able to leverage these tools to assist with a wide range of projects including those on climate adaptation, public health and disaster response.\nThe dataset and code are available now on GitHub.\nTo support the ongoing work of researchers, governments, nonprofits, and humanitarians around the world, the Data for Good at Meta program is open-sourcing the first set of training data and sample code used to construct Meta’s AI-powered population maps.\nAs the world looks towards the increasing threat of climate change, Meta’s AI-powered population maps, and the data behind them, offer significant opportunities to direct investments in disaster preparedness through improved estimation of global flood exposure and in climate adaptation planning.\nBy open sourcing these tools, we hope that other researchers can generate new insights for speeding the delivery of sustainable energy and climate resilient infrastructure around the world.\nWhy we need better population maps\nAccurate estimates of population are taken for granted in many countries. Governments in advanced economies can rely on a variety of sources including tax records or census datasets to better estimate their population and make informed decisions on the delivery of services. However, in other parts of the world, accurate population data is hard to come by. In certain low- and middle-income countries, the most recent census may have been conducted decades ago or lack accurate representation of vulnerable populations. Furthermore, estimates between censuses are often fraught with inaccuracies and remote populations may be entirely missing from official sources. As a result, uncounted communities may live outside the reach of critical programs. \nTo combat this challenge, Meta began the process of mapping the world’s population using artificial intelligence and satellite imagery in 2017. Alongside other leading population mapping institutions like Columbia University’s Center for Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) and WorldPop at the University of Southampton, we have openly published hundreds of high resolution population maps and datasets. These have been used around the world by governments and nonprofits for social programs ranging from the targeting of COVID-19 interventions to the delivery of clean water. As the world’s natural resource and energy demands scale, accurate population estimates also offer significant opportunities to improve sustainability efforts.\nThe World Bank leveraged Meta’s AI-powered population maps to identify potential COVID-19 hotspots in Kinshasa, DRC.\nBackground on Meta’s AI-powered population maps\nData for Good’s AI-powered population maps estimate the number of people living within 30-meter grid tiles in nearly every country around the world. These maps leverage computer vision techniques – similar to those leveraged to identify objects in photos for the visually impaired – to identify human-made structures in satellite imagery. The outputs of Meta’s AI model are then combined with population stock estimates from CIESIN to approximate the number of people living in each tile. \nIn addition to total population counts, Meta’s population maps also include demographic breakdowns for groups such as the number of children under five, women of reproductive age, youth, and the elderly. \nAI-powered population estimates have been scientifically evaluated to be among the most accurate in the world for mapping population distribution for a variety of geographies and use-cases. For example, this 2022 paper by researchers at the University of Southampton and University of Ghana in Nature – Scientific Reports compares various population density estimates for use in mapping flooding risk in west Africa. Other studies have investigated a variety of use-cases such as mapping landslide risk and malaria eradication; and a range of countries including Haiti, Malawi, Madagascar, Nepal, Rwanda, and Thailand. \nOpen-sourcing training data for our AI population maps\nThis initial set of training data consists of almost 10 million labels for over 126 gigabytes of satellite imagery and includes human labels on these satellite imagery patches indicating if a building is present. These labels were created on satellite imagery dating from 2011 – 2020; however, even labels made on older imagery are useful to train the next generation of machine vision models (like Meta’s Segment Anything) to more accurately identify buildings in a range of land-cover environments. In addition to this first batch, we plan to release additional data and code for computer vision training in the future.\nOpen sourcing Meta’s training data and code allows population mapping partners like CIESIN and WorldPop to continue the progress made in the last decade. These tools reduce development costs for research units to generate even more accurate population estimates and also allows researchers working on building detection to improve their methods, especially when combined with more recent satellite imagery. Future data released from CIESIN and data collaborations like GRID3 will continue to push boundaries of spatial resolution and accuracy as the result of their work collaborating with many African countries to generate, validate, and use core spatial datasets in support of sustainable development.   \nTo better visualize village settlement locations and calculate service coverage, World Vision turned to an innovative dataset developed by Meta’s Data for Good (D4G) and Columbia University’s Center for International Earth Science Information Network  (CIESIN). The resulting High Resolution Settlement Layer (HRSL) has been a game-changer for visualizing the geography of clean water.\n–Allen Hollenbach, Technical Director for World Vision Water and Sanitation\n\nApplications in sustainable electrification, clean water, and climate change adaptation\nNonprofit organizations and governments around the world have already leveraged Meta’s AI-powered population maps for a range of social impact programs, including the World Bank’s rural electrification efforts in Somalia and Benin and similar efforts in Uganda by the World Resources Institute.  \nWorld Vision has also used these datasets in accelerating the progress in five-year plans for water and sanitation in places like Rwanda and Zambia and  just recently announced having reached one million additional Rwandans with clean water using insights from these maps to track progress towards universal water coverage.\nWorld Vision used Meta’s high resolution population maps to identify the population and associated settlements closest to existing water points and target areas where new water points were needed.\nInnovation in global population mapping is only possible through the type of collaboration Meta continues to have with Columbia University and WorldPop and a shared commitment to open source enables researchers and governments around the world to participate in this process.\nPlease visit the Data for Good website for more information about Meta’s Data for Good program.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At Meta, React and React Native are more than just tools; they are integral to our product development and innovation. With over five thousand people at Meta building products and experiences with React every month, these technologies are fundamental to our engineering culture and our ability to quickly build and ship high quality products. In this post, we will dive into the development experiences of some of the product teams who leveraged React and React Native to deliver exciting projects showcased at Meta Connect 2024.\nInstagram and Facebook For Meta Quest\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/RNBlogDemo-compressed.mp4\n\n\nBuilding Meta’s social apps from scratch in MR required our teams to thoughtfully leverage the platform capabilities offered by Meta Quest while keeping a tremendously high bar for quality. The teams first had to decide how to build them: reusing the existing Android apps, writing a new native Android app, or using React Native to build from scratch. We wanted to offer a hero experience that looked and felt at home on Meta Quest, taking advantage of the additional input types, gestures, and larger visual surface area. Instead of simply porting our mobile social apps, we chose React Native as it enabled our teams to iterate and build quickly with robust animation capabilities, great performance, and a shared platform that powers most of the 2D Meta Quest system apps.\nOn Instagram, React Native enabled our teams to build rich animations and novel interactions that embody the brand’s deep focus on quality and delight. For this new app, we introduced seamless transitions of video posts from feed into a full screen view side by side with comments, without dropping a single frame. We enabled the ability to swipe through stacks of photos with the controller joystick or pinching your hands. We also introduced a unique hover animation over interactive elements that smoothly follows your controller movements.\nWhen building Facebook for Meta Quest, our teams took advantage of the mature code and infrastructure that supports our Facebook.com desktop experience. We leveraged code sharing technologies to reuse some of the most complex and robust features from Facebook.com like Newsfeed and commenting. Some of these code sharing technologies include our Meta open source projects like StyleX and React Strict DOM. By sharing code, our teams could spend less time on repetitive business logic and focus more on adding Meta Quest specific interactions and experiences.\nMeta Horizon mobile app\n\nThis year, we also rolled out the new Meta Horizon mobile app – a new look and a new name. We expanded the app to make it easier to socialize and express yourself both in and out of the headset. We added a dedicated tab to easily customize your avatar and express your mood, right from your phone. People can also visit Horizon Worlds and complete quests from the app to unlock exclusive avatar styles, items, and emotes.\nWe’ve also continued to improve app performance. At Meta, our teams typically look to Facebook Marketplace as a React Native performance benchmark. However, the Meta Horizon app is a standalone app with React Native in the initialization path of the app’s cold start, compared to the Facebook app which initializes React Native when you visit your first React Native surface and not on app start. The performance results our teams delivered with React Native exceeded our original expectations and are on par with Meta’s mobile social apps.\nOur Meta Horizon team worked closely with our React team to profile our application and find opportunities for improvement using Android Systrace, React DevTools, and the new React Native DevTools. The most impactful improvement that our teams made was initiating network queries earlier. Instead of initiating network requests when a component of the product surface was rendered, Relay, our GraphQL library, made it easy for our teams to move that network fetch to start when the navigation button from the previous surface was clicked.\nMeta Horizon Store\n\nWe also announced that the Meta Horizon Store is now open for all developers to publish apps, including 2D apps. To support this change, we made major changes to the Horizon Store; changes to our navigation to support significantly more categories, better ranking and categorization of apps, and a new “Early Access” section.\nThe Meta Horizon Store includes the surfaces that let you discover and acquire applications and games for Meta Quest, as well as explore Worlds you can travel to in Horizon. Since we have a centralized team that maintains the Store across four platforms (Android, iOS, Horizon OS, Web) and we need feature parity across these interfaces, the team has benefited tremendously from being able to use React and React Native even though these are primarily separate implementations today. These technologies have enabled the team to roll out new features and experiments much faster with a smaller team.\nJust like the new Instagram and Facebook apps, and everything else using React at Meta, our teams use the bleeding edge of React infra like the React Compiler and the New React Native Architecture. The React team partnered with multiple teams over the last few years to build out infrastructure and capabilities to enable cross platform code sharing, which the Meta Horizon Store team has started to take advantage of. For example, the Meta Horizon Store’s navigation and routing infrastructure was originally quite different between platforms. The team is now reusing Meta’s internal router for React apps that was originally built for Facebook.com which now also works with React Native. We also converted the Meta Horizon Store on the web from using pure CSS to using StyleX, which in combination with React Strict DOM, has enabled them to reuse the Spotlight section of the Meta Horizon Store across web and mixed reality. This enabled us to more quickly support internationalized text rendering and light/dark mode for banners, and accelerated future enhancements for our merchandising team.\nMeta Spatial Editor\nhttps://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/spatial-compressed.mp4\n\nMeta Spatial SDK and Meta Spatial Editor to enable mobile developers to create immersive experiences for Meta Horizon OS using familiar Android languages, libraries, and tools, along with unique Meta Quest capabilities, such as physics, MR, and 3D. Creating great 3D experiences always requires being able to visualize and edit your scenes directly. The Meta Spatial Editor is a new desktop app that lets you import, organize, and transform your assets into visual compositions and export them, using the glTF standard, into Meta Spatial SDK.\nOur teams built the app with React Native for Desktop, providing users with native Windows and macOS apps and providing our teams with the incredible developer experience of React. One of the key factors in the teams’ decision to use React Native for Desktop instead of other web-based desktop solutions is that React Native enables the team to utilize native integrations when needed. The main 3D scene in the app is powered by a custom 3D rendering engine, requiring a custom React Native Native Component integration. The React Native panels on the scene let users modify all sorts of properties which then communicate with the 3D renderer via C++, enabling us to update the UI at 60fps.\nThe Meta Spatial Editor team had many engineers who primarily had a C++ background and were used to building with Qt. These team members were initially skeptical of JavaScript but ended up loving the developer experience provided by React Native, such as Fast Refresh. Web developers take for granted that code changes can be seen on file-save, but it is still extremely uncommon for native engineers. This developer experience enabled our teams to build much more quickly with React Native.\nThis is how Meta builds React\nOver a decade ago, Meta introduced React to the industry through open source. Our React team at Meta is so proud of these experiences that were announced at Meta Connect 2024. These products showcase the power, expressivity, and flexibility of what’s possible with React: delightful interactions, deeply complex integrations, and incredibly responsive interfaces. And of course, they all render natively on their respective platforms to match user expectations.\nOver the past decade, the React team has partnered deeply with both teams at Meta as well as members of the open source community to enable these types of product and developer experiences. Engineers at Meta use React on every platform where we ship user interfaces: web, mobile, desktop, and new platforms such as MR. Each time the React team has added support for a new platform, the team has invested in deeply understanding the idioms and expectations for user experiences on that platform, then adapting and optimizing React accordingly. We’ve consistently found that improving React for one platform benefits others as well — an approach the React teams described in their Many Platform Vision. \nThis pattern has continued as the teams expanded support to the constraints and opportunities of mixed reality devices. Our teams have improved startup and application responsiveness, improved efficiency to reduce battery drain, and taken major steps to enable code sharing across web and native platforms — with platform-specific customizations. These wins have consistently benefited our apps on other platforms, with user experience improvements in products such as Facebook.com and Facebook Marketplace. \nOur engineers invest in these improvements knowing that they will benefit not only products created by Meta, but all React products in the world. Meta continues to share these improvements with the open source community whenever we have built our confidence that they are stable enough for broader adoption. We’ve previously shared some of these technologies with the open source community, including React Compiler, React 19, React Native’s New Architecture, StyleX, React Strict DOM, and performance improvements to Hermes. These innovations and more are currently under development, and our teams look forward to sharing them with the open source community in the future!\nStranger Things /© Netflix.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Code completion has always been a standout feature in JetBrains IDEs, helping developers code faster, smarter, and with fewer mistakes. But what if it could do even more? What if it could predict not just the next element but entire lines of code – or even complete blocks? That’s exactly what we’ve been working on.\nAs we’ve invested time and effort into AI, our code completion has evolved into something incredibly powerful – more precise, faster, and smarter than ever.\nIn this blog post, we decided to share what stands behind AI code completion in JetBrains IDEs, how it has evolved over time, and what exciting developments are on the horizon. Let’s go!\nWhat is JetBrains AI code completion?\nJetBrains offers two ways of delivering AI code completion:\nLocal Full Line Code Completion built into JetBrains IDEs: This works directly on your machine, providing real-time suggestions without requiring an internet connection, which ensures that the suggestions are quick and cater specifically to your project context.\nCloud-based AI code completion provided by JetBrains AI Assistant: This uses cloud resources to offer more precise code completion, leveraging greater computational power than local resources can provide.\nTogether, these two approaches ensure you get both quick, context-aware suggestions locally and more powerful, cloud-driven assistance when needed.\nOur approach prioritizes both the quality and speed of the suggestions. We recognize that developers need quick and accurate completions to maintain their flow. As such, we designed our system to be less noisy and distracting. Unlike tools that bombard you with overwhelming multi-line completions, our AI completion is calibrated to offer concise, relevant suggestions right when you need them.\nIt’s been a year – how is Full Line Code Completion doing?\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the milestone releases in 2023.3 and 2024.1, our metrics have remained stable and continue to grow, showing millions of completions per day, an acceptance rate of 35% or more, and an explicit cancel rate of just 5%, making it one of the best-performing code completion products for IntelliJ-based IDEs. It is available out of the box for more than 11 major languages and multiple frameworks with lightweight local models.\nThe 2024.2 release was mainly UX-oriented for Full Line Code Completion, extending the whole pipeline. However,  we also improved quality and red code filtering. Additionally, we released support for Rider, CLion, RustRover, and Terraform.\nWhat about cloud-based AI code completion?\nThere’s too much to say about this topic to cover it all, so we’ll just try to summarize the key user feedback we received before discussing how we can overcome the issues they’ve identified.\nLimited suggestion frequency\nIn the previous release, we took a conservative approach to code completion, triggering it only when the user pressed Enter. This design was due to the demands of an extensive LLM, which required significant processing time. However, we realized that this approach was insufficient because users don’t press Enter frequently during their coding process. Fun fact: On average, a developer only presses Enter ~70 times a day.\nHard to read big chunks of gray multi-line suggestions\nImagine you’re writing a small, simple function, and the completion suggests a very large block of code, making it difficult to see the next line after the caret. Longer completions can take more time to review and integrate, which may disrupt the workflow.\nUnpredictable suggestions\nIn addition to everything mentioned above, the model sometimes produced suggestions that were not fully aligned with user expectations. While many were accurate, there were cases where it offered extended enumeration variable creations, made mistakes in the middle, or responded more conversationally. Extensive LLMs take several seconds to generate suggestions, leading to noticeable delays. Code completion must be rapid and responsive for an efficient experience.\n\n\n\n\nSo, how did we fix it?\nWe went for the good ol’ “rewrite everything from scratch” approach, of course. We are developers, after all! 🙂\n\nJokes aside, we did indeed decide to completely rewrite cloud completion using the IDE-side pipeline from our Full Line Code Completion with new JetBrains in-house LLMs specifically trained for code completion. It was a rough ride, but we managed to implement fixes for all of the issues above! 🎉\nStarting from the 2024.2 release of AI Assistant for IntelliJ-based IDEs, we introduced a reworked pipeline and a new in-house LLM:\nFor Java, Python, and Kotlin, starting from 2024.2\nFor Go, starting from 2024.2.1\nFor PHP, JavaScript/TypeScript, CSS, and HTML, starting from 2024.2.2\nWe’re going to switch all languages to an advanced pipeline and new model in 2024.3.\nHere are some of the fundamental changes we’ve implemented:\nHighlighting instead of gray text\nTo simplify reading large blocks generated by our models, we now highlight the suggested code. This change is designed to reduce the cognitive load on developers. By using syntax-aware highlighting, the suggestions now mirror the look and feel of your handwritten code, making them easier to scan and evaluate at a glance.\n\n\n\n\nSmarter and faster JetBrains in-house LLMs\nWhile large models are often better at handling a variety of tasks, a tailored code model will perform better on specialized tasks. They also offer benefits like more control, no need for prompt engineering, and much lower latency. This has proven true for us as well. By training a relatively small, highly specialized model and enhancing inference mechanisms, we’ve significantly improved code completion accuracy and speed. Stay tuned for upcoming posts where we’ll share more details about this model.\n\n\n\n\nMore locations and careful single-/multi-line selection\nTo increase the number of shown suggestions, completion is now triggered during typing, not only on Enter keystrokes. We’ve also limited locations where multi-line completion can be shown. By adopting a more conservative, language-dependent strategy, we’ve ensured that our cloud-based code completion remains intuitive and user-friendly while keeping the same total amount of generated code. We are committed to refining this strategy and expanding its capabilities in future updates.\nReworked multi-line completion UX\nWe completely reworked how multi-line suggestions are shown, especially in combination with in-IDE popup completions (previously, this wasn’t even possible).\n\n\n\n\nPartial acceptance\nThis is something our users have been asking about for a while! You can now accept completion suggestions token by token or line by line.\nAccept word by word – ⌥ → / Alt + Right.\nAccept line by line – ⌘ → / Ctrl + Right.\nAs before, you can explicitly call completion with ⇧ ⌥ / / Shift + Alt.\n\n\n\n\nImproved project awareness and reworked context collection\nWith offline and online evaluations in place to assess different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategies, we chose the one that works stably and predictably. Suggestions now utilize the context of the entire project to offer relevant, high-quality blocks of code. Having full control over inference has allowed us to prevent small inconsistencies like incorrect indentation and to filter out undesirable suggestions.\nIs the new cloud completion good?\nPretty good, yeah!\nThere’s nothing better than online logs. Based on data collected over August 2024, we’re already seeing some positive results through user feedback and usage metrics. Let’s take a look at three different setups for Java, Python, and Kotlin:\nThe old version of AI cloud-based code completion in JetBrains AI Assistant 2024.1\nThe new version of AI cloud-based code completion in JetBrains AI Assistant 2024.2\nLocal Full Line Code Completion in 2024.2\nThis comparison only gives approximate results. Moreover, full line is single-line only, and AI Assistant is both single- and multi-line. \nThe acceptance rate for new cloud completion is generally higher than full line, consistently outperforming old cloud completion.\n\n\n\n\nUsers explicitly cancel new cloud completion much less often than before.\n\n\n\n\nThe overall completion latency, from the moment you start typing to when the suggestion is rendered, has significantly decreased compared to the old system.\n\n\n\n\nThe daily number of shown completions in 2024.2 is already much higher than in the 2024.1 release. It consistently outperforms much faster local models by suggesting more relevant proposals.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the average length of completion was intentionally reduced for the new cloud completion. We suggest multi-line completions much more carefully, ensuring we don’t disturb you while you read the code or think about the solution. We plan to gradually introduce more locations for showing multi-line suggestions after thoroughly confirming they are viewed positively during our testing.\n\n\n\n\nYou can already try the new completion in 2024.2 IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, and GoLand. In the next release, we’ll focus on solving the “Tab shortcut clash” with non-AI completion, relaxing strict filtering, multi-line quality and quantity, triggering positions, and adapting the amount of code in suggestions. We’ve been hard at work, and you can check out the updates in the EAPs for the 2024.3 release!\nWhat’s next?\nWe’ll continue to push our local and cloud completions, adding more multi-line suggestions for cloud, introducing multi-lines to local, supporting more languages, improving the quality of models, enhancing the UX, and much more.\nI also want to thank everyone who has submitted feedback and reported issues – your contributions have directly shaped the improvements and features. Thank you, and please keep the feedback flowing! You can share your thoughts in the comments to this blog post, on the AI Assistant plugin page, or on YouTrack.\nThe JetBrains completion crew ❤️",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "For nearly twenty years, the .NET community has enjoyed working with solution files (*.sln). Due to their tooling-centered format, manually changing these files has always been challenging. Merge conflicts in solution files—much like merging CSPROJ files—were commonplace and often resulted in corrupted files or lost changes.\nThe structure of SLN files is overly verbose—an empty solution file starts at nine lines of code with 225 characters! Every added project contributes six lines and duplicated GUID references throughout the file. On top of that, it often seems impossible to remember which of the two GUIDs represents the project ID. Also, the duplication of project names and solution items offers no real benefit despite expectations:\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00\nProject(\"{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}\") = \"CSharpConsoleApp\", \"CSharpConsoleApp\\CSharpConsoleApp.csproj\", \"{56AC6E9D-28FA-60C6-322C-7A6C3A2CF147}\"\nEndProject\nProject(\"{2150E333-8FDC-42A3-9474-1A3956D46DE8}\") = \"SolutionFolder1\", \"SolutionFolder1\", \"{C6BC3CF2-0D31-8D54-D372-94C86BEC98BA}\"\n    ProjectSection(SolutionItems) = preProject\n        global.json = global.json\n    EndProjectSection\nEndProject\nGlobal\n    GlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution\n        Debug|Any CPU = Debug|Any CPU\n        Release|Any CPU = Release|Any CPU\n    EndGlobalSection\n    GlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution\n        {56AC6E9D-28FA-60C6-322C-7A6C3A2CF147}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Debug|Any CPU\n        {56AC6E9D-28FA-60C6-322C-7A6C3A2CF147}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU\n        {56AC6E9D-28FA-60C6-322C-7A6C3A2CF147}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Release|Any CPU\n        {56AC6E9D-28FA-60C6-322C-7A6C3A2CF147}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU\n    EndGlobalSection\nEndGlobal\nBut enough ranting. Microsoft introduced a new SLNX format based on XML as a solution (pun intended!) to fix these issues. We at JetBrains are excited to announce that Rider provides beta support already!\nDownload Rider 2024.3 EAP\nGetting Started\nYou can translate your existing solution to an SLNX file by right-clicking on its node in the Explorer window. From there, you can choose Save as… | Save as XML Solution (.slnx):\nSaving a Solution in SLNX Format\n\n\n\n\nNext to your original SLN file, you will now see a clean and minimal SLNX file that everyone should feel confident to edit manually. Our example from the introduction looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\nAfter you confirm the saving dialog, Rider will also offer you to open the freshly created SLNX file:\nPrompt to open a newly created XML Solution\n\n\n\n\nYou can also translate SLNX files back to the SLN format, which is particularly important if your development environment or team requires both files (more details below). Open an SLNX file, and find the Save as Solution (.sln) action in the very same context menu location:\nSaving an XML Solution in SLN Format\n\n\n\n\nLimitations\nMicrosoft is still developing the SLNX format as a preview feature, and it has yet to be officially announced. Despite this, the community is excited and eager to migrate, as the format shows immense promise. As a result, there are a few limitations within the broader ecosystem that users should be aware of.\nSince there is no official dotnet new template, Rider also currently doesn’t offer one from the New Project dialog.\nThe .NET CLI and MSBuild don’t yet support SLNX files. Therefore, it’s most certainly necessary to keep both files in your repository so that your CI/CD infrastructure can do its work. Regarding that, please note that Rider does not automatically synchronize the two files.\nConclusion\nAlthough the SLNX format is still in preview, it already looks like a promising answer to the challenges .NET developers have faced for years with the old proprietary SLN format. Rider 2024.3 EAP introduces initial support for reading and writing the new SLNX format based on our research. We look forward to Microsoft publishing the details of the new SLNX schema and making it generally available to the community!\nDownload Rider 2024.3 EAP",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 4 is now available!\nYou can download this version from our website, update directly from within the IDE, use the free Toolbox App, or install it via snap packages for Ubuntu.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 4\nIf you missed our previous overviews of the newly added features, visit the IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP section of our blog to catch up. This week’s build introduces valuable UI/UX enhancements across the IDE, including updates to the Run widget, Java code formatter, terminal, and more. Additionally, support for Maven’s split local repositories has been added.\nCheck it out!\nUser experience\nRun widget: Launch multiple configurations simultaneously\nThe updated Run widget lets you launch multiple configurations simultaneously by holding Ctrl and clicking the Debug icon in the popup. Additionally, the widget displays controls for all running configurations, providing a clear overview of their statuses and simplifying management.\n\n\n\n\nJava code formatter improvements\nA new option in IntelliJ IDEA’s code formatter allows you to retain blank lines between annotations and field declarations – something developers commonly do in JPA entities to improve readability.\nPreviously, the formatter treated these blank lines as redundant and removed them unconditionally. While it was possible to leave blank lines around fields, this approach wasn’t ideal, as removing unnecessary blank lines is generally considered best practice.\nRecognizing the need for flexibility in this specific case, we’ve provided an option that lets you control the formatter’s behavior around annotations. You can find this new option via Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java | Blank Lines.\n\n\n\n\nIncreased default tab limit\nWe’ve increased the default tab limit in the editor to 30. This means you can now keep more tabs open before the IDE starts closing the least recently used ones. You can control this setting in Settings | Editor | General | Editor Tabs.\n\n\n\n\nOptimized placement for the Rename action\nWe’ve optimized the placement of the Rename action in the context menu when called on elements in the editor and the Project tool window. The action is now at the top level, making it easier for users who frequently rely on the mouse to quickly rename files, variables, and other elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdated UI for the new terminal\nWe’ve updated the new terminal’s UI with a more compact design, reducing padding to maximize your screen real estate. The smaller padding saves space, giving you enhanced visibility while working with commands without sacrificing readability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild tools\nSupport for Maven’s split local repositories\nIn IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 EAP 4, we’ve added full support for Maven’s split local repositories – a feature introduced in Maven 3.9.\nMaven’s split repositories allow you to separate local repositories according to your needs. You can group them by remote repository, store locally installed artifacts in a dedicated folder, or even categorize artifacts by branch using specialized prefixes.\nPreviously, enabling split repositories in Maven could result in sync failures in IntelliJ IDEA. The IDE might have struggled to correctly locate artifacts in these divided repositories, leading to build or dependency resolution issues. With this release, IntelliJ IDEA fully supports Maven’s split local repositories, ensuring smooth syncing and efficient repository management.\nWell, that’s a wrap for week 4!

You can interact with it right where you do most of your work – in the editor. \nStuck with an error in your code? Need to add documentation or tests? Just start typing your request on a new line in the editor, just as if you were typing in the AI Assistant chat window. PyCharm will automatically recognize your natural language request and generate a response.  \n\n\n\n\nPyCharm leaves a purple mark in the gutter next to lines changed by AI Assistant so you can easily see what has been updated. \nIf you don’t like the initial suggestion, you can generate a new one by pressing Tab. You can also adjust the initial input by clicking on the purple block in the gutter or simply pressing Ctrl+/ or ⌘/.\nWant to get assistance with a specific argument? You can narrow the context that AI Assistant uses for its response as much as you want. Just put the caret in the relevant context, type the $ or ? symbol, and start writing. PyCharm will recognize your prompt and take the current context into account for its suggestions. \n\n\n\n\nThe new inline AI assistance works for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and YAML file formats, while the option to narrow the context works only for Python so far.\nThis feature is available to all AI Assistant subscribers in the second PyCharm 2024.3 EAP build. You can get a free trial version of AI Assistant straight in the IDE: to enable AI Assistant, open a project in PyCharm, click the AI icon on the right-hand toolbar, and follow the instructions that appear. \nDownload PyCharm 2024.3 EAP",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization are some of the most time-consuming tasks for data scientists. Nearly 50% of data specialists dedicate 30% or more of their time to data preparation. The pandas and Polars libraries are widely used for these purposes, each offering unique advantages. PyCharm supports both libraries, enabling users to efficiently explore, clean, and visualize data, even with large datasets. \nIn this blog post, you’ll discover how PyCharm’s interactive tables can enhance your productivity when working with either Polars or pandas. You will also learn how to perform many different data exploration tasks without writing any code and how to use JetBrains AI Assistant for data analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting started \nTo start using pandas for data analysis, import the library and load data from a file using pd.read_csv(“FileName”), or drag and drop a CSV file into a Jupyter notebook. If you’re using Polars, import the library and use pl.read_csv(“FileName/path to the file”) to load data into a DataFrame. Then, print the dataset just by using the name of the variable.\nPyCharm’s interactive tables – key features and uses\nBrowse, sort, and view datasets\nInteractive tables offer a wide range of features that allow you to easily explore your data. For example, you can navigate through your data with infinite horizontal and vertical scrolling, use single and multiple column sorting, and many other features.\n\n\n\n\nThis feature allows you to sort columns alphabetically or maintain the existing column order. You can also find specific columns by typing the column name in the Column List menu. Through the context menu or Column List, you can selectively hide or display columns. For deeper analysis, you can hide all but the essential columns or use the Hide Other Columns option to focus on a single column.\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can open your dataframe in a separate window for even more in-depth analysis.\n\n\n\n\nExplore your data \nYou can easily understand data types directly from column headers. For example,  is used for a data type object, while  indicates numeric data.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, you can access descriptive statistics by hovering over column headers in Compact mode or view them directly in Detailed mode, where distribution histograms are also available.\n\nCreate code-free data visualizations\nInteractive tables also offer several features available in the Chart view section.\nNo-code chart creation, allowing you to visualize data effortlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to compare graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbility to save your charts with one click.\n\n\n\n\nUse AI Assistant for data analysis and visualization\nYou can access the AI Assistant in the upper-left corner of the tables for the following purposes:\nTo access insights about your data quickly with AI Assistant.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse AI Assistant to visualize your data. \n\n\n\n\nUsing interactive tables for reliable Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\nWhy is EDA important? \nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data science, as it allows data scientists to understand the underlying structure and patterns within a dataset before applying any modeling techniques. EDA helps you identify anomalies, detect outliers, and uncover relationships among variables – all of which are essential for making informed decisions.\nInteractive tables offer many features that allow you to explore your data faster and get reliable results.\nSpotting statistics, patterns, and outliers \nViewing the dataset information\nLet’s look at a real-life example of how the tables could boost the productivity of your EDA. For this example, we will use the Bengaluru House Dataset. Normally we start with an overview of our data. This includes just viewing it to understand the size of the dataset, data types of the columns, and so on. While you can certainly do this with the help of code, using interactive tables allows you to get this data without code. So, in our example, the size of the dataset is 13,320 rows and 9 columns, as you can see in the table header.\n\n\n\n\nOur dataset also contains different data types, including numeric and string data. This means we can use different techniques for working with data, including correlation analysis and others.\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course you can take a look at the data with the help of infinite scrolling and other features we mentioned above.\nPerforming statistical analysis\nAfter getting acquainted with the data, the next step might be more in-depth analysis of the statistics. PyCharm provides a lot of important information about the columns in the table headers, including missing data, mode, mean, median, and so on.\nFor example, here we see that many columns have missing data. In the “bath” column, we obviously have an outlier, as the max value significantly exceeds the 95th percentile.\n\nAdditionally, data type mismatches, such as “total_sqft” not being a float or integer, indicate inconsistencies that could impact data processing and analysis.\n\nAfter sorting, we notice one possible reason for the problem: the use of text values in data and ranges instead of normal numerical values.\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data using AI\nAdditionally, if our dataset doesn’t have hundreds of columns, we can use the help of AI Assistant and ask it to explain the DataFrame. From there, we can prompt it with any important questions, such as “What data problems in the dataset should be addressed and how?”\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing data with built-in charting\nIn some cases, data visualization can help you understand your data. PyCharm interactive tables provide two options for that. The first is Chart View and the second is Generate Visualizations in Chat. \nLet’s say my hypothesis is that the price of a house should be correlated with its total floor area. In other words, the bigger a house is, the more expensive it should be. In this case, I can use a scatter plot in Chart View and discover that my hypothesis is likely correct.\n\nWrapping up\nPyCharm Professional’s interactive tables offer numerous benefits that significantly boost your productivity in data exploration and data cleaning. The tables allow you to work with the most popular data science library, pandas, and the fast-growing framework Polars, without writing any code. This is because the tables provide features like browsing, sorting, and viewing datasets; code-free visualizations; and AI-assisted insights.\nInteractive tables in PyCharm not only save your time but also reduce the complexity of data manipulation tasks, allowing you to focus on deriving meaningful insights instead of writing boilerplate code for basic tasks.\nDownload PyCharm Professional and get an extended 60-day trial by using the promo code “PyCharmNotebooks”.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "One of the key components of TeamCity’s ecosystem is the bundled Amazon Cloud Agents plugin, which allows our customers to leverage cloud agents to scale the performance of their build farms on demand. Given its widespread use and importance, ensuring its optimal performance is essential. \nAs our user base and workload have grown, we’ve noticed some initial performance oversights becoming more pronounced, prompting a closer look at the plugin’s performance.\nPerformance issues with the Amazon Cloud Agents plugin\nThe main culprit for performance issues with the plugin was thread management. Each Cloud Profile would create its own pool to manage instance operations and additional service threads for internal purposes. When the number of Cloud Profiles was low enough, the performance hit was hardly noticeable. \nHowever, the impact of this issue worsened as users kept adding more and more profiles. Given that TeamCity itself is a complex system operating hundreds of threads continuously, adding a considerable amount of additional threads is not something we should take lightly. \nImplementing parameterizable shared thread pools for recurring and one-off tasks solves this problem. This approach will allow for asynchronous operations, like instance provision requests that don’t wait for an instance to start, to be executed promptly without needlessly straining the system.\nBut what happens when the number of threads exceeds the measured optimal amount for a system?\nThe short answer: it causes gradual performance degradation. Eventually, even a highly parallel system will suffer from excessive threads. Common problems include, but are not limited to, context switching and synchronization overhead (e.g. locks). Here, we’ll focus on context switching.\nWhat exactly is context switching?\nContext switching is a very complex topic with many technical details, but for the purposes of this post, we’ll keep it brief. A context switch is a fundamental OS process that saves the state of a running thread and restores the state of another thread. This includes saving and loading CPU registers, stack pointers, and other information crucial to continuing a thread’s execution from an arbitrary point.\nWhat is the impact of this? Each thread is allocated a CPU time slice known as a “quantum”. However, the context switch overhead reduces the effective CPU time available for actual thread execution. This overhead might include processor cache misses and memory contention, depending on the system and workload.\nAs with any performance problem: measure, don’t guess.\nThe solution: applying the patch\nBelow are some performance charts that cover the period between July 1 and August 25. The patch that aims to fight the aforementioned issues was applied around the middle of this period, on August 9.\nThe first graph shows the thread count.\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the reduction might look dramatic at first, the starting point is around 575 threads, so the overall reduction in threads is ~25%, or ~250 threads. \nThe next graph shows the queue size of builds waiting to run.\n\n\n\n\nBefore the patch was applied, the chart hit 16,000–20,000 builds on multiple occasions, with frequent spikes above 10,000 queued builds. After August 9, the chart clearly becomes more stable and shows much more moderate spikes.\nGraph showing the number of starting cloud agents.\n\n\n\n\nLowering the average values means we process agents’ provision requests more efficiently and, as a result, cloud agents start noticeably faster. That’s exactly what we observed on August 9: the reduction of both spike frequency and their maximum values.\nWhat does this mean for our users?\nPerformance metrics are a great tool to measure the result of your efforts, but one can argue these efforts are more or less futile if end-users gain no real advantages. With cloud agents, this is definitely not the case – users directly benefit from faster build processing, shorter build queues, and less time required for an agent to wind up. \nAnd as a cherry on top, eliminating so many threads should raise the overall performance and responsiveness of the entire system, ultimately making it more stable and efficient.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we have a JetBrains Community Contributor (JBCC) program aimed at helping community content creators get the most out of their JetBrains tools when creating articles, social media posts, videos, and public presentations. It’s a fantastic program where we try to provide help and feedback and learn from each other.\nOne innovative idea we’ve been exploring and are thrilled to share with you is integrating your presentation slides into your IDE. This approach eliminates the need for constant context-switching between your code and visuals. By the end of this post, you’ll be equipped with the knowledge to craft your presentation slides using Markdown, convert them into HTML artifacts, and preview the presentation using your IDE’s in-editor preview, all with a sense of excitement for the possibilities this opens up.\nMARP: Markdown Presentation Ecosystem\nWhile dedicated presentation tools such as PowerPoint and Keynote have advantages, they can be cumbersome and come with unique challenges. In the developer community, we see a prevalence of text-to-presentation tools that aim to transform simple files into visually striking presentations.\nOne such approach is MARP, which allows you to author an entire presentation in a single Markdown file. Let’s look at a presentation we’ll be showing in our IDE.\n---\ntheme: uncover\n---\n\n![bg right:40% 80%](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/Rider_icon.svg)\n\n# **Hello JetBrains Rider**\n\n🧛‍♂️ JetBrains Rider Presentation Cool! 😎🌶️\n\nhttps://jetbrains.com/rider\n\n---\n\n# How to write slides\n\nSplit pages by horizontal ruler (`---`). It's very simple! :satisfied:\n\n```csharp\npublic static IEnumerable<int> Fibonacci(int n)\n{\n    int a = 0, b = 1;\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)\n    {\n        yield return a;\n        int temp = a;\n        a = b;\n        b = temp + b;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n🪲 Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!\n\n---\n\n# A New Slide!\n\n<div class=\"mermaid\">\ngraph TD;\n    A-->B;\n    A-->C;\n</div>\n\n<!-- Add this anywhere in your Markdown file -->\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import mermaid from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mermaid@10/dist/mermaid.esm.min.mjs';\n  mermaid.initialize({ startOnLoad: true });\n</script>\n\n\n\n\nEach slide is separated by the --- delimiter, with the contents of each slide appearing between each section. You can use all the Markdown techniques you’ve learned in writing documentation, including headers, links, code blocks, emphasis, math syntax, and emojis.\nCheck out the Marpit documentation to learn how to author your presentation. Marpit is the framework that transforms Markdown and CSS themes into slide decks composed of HTML/CSS. It is optimized to output only the minimum set of assets required. It has a detailed breakdown of all the options available to presentation authors.\nLet’s move on to the next section, where we’ll set up the MARP CLI in our projects so that our presentation can live side-by-side with our demo project.\nMARP CLI with your Project\nThe MARP CLI allows us to use all of MARP’s capabilities from a command-line interface. You’ll need npm installed on your local development environment to do this. Once installed, add the following package.json to the root of your project or in any folder where you’ll write your presentation.\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"marp\": \"marp index.md -w --html --allow-local-files \"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@marp-team/marp-cli\": \"^3.4.0\"\n  }\n}\nYou’ll notice the marp script passes a few flags and arguments. The most important is the -w flag, which lets the CLI monitor and update the file as we create our presentation.\nNext, let’s create an index.md file next to the package.json file. You can use the previous Markdown above or experiment with writing your own.\nNow run npm install to install the @marp-team/marp-cli dependency. You’ll notice in your package.json file that you now have a run button in the editor’s gutter.\n\n\n\n\nRun the new script, and you’ll see a new run window showing the MARP CLI output, which says that you now have an index.html file in the same directory as your Markdown.\n\n\n\n\nChanges to the Markdown file will now update the HTML file in real-time. The advantage is that you’ll only need to run the marp script when editing your Markdown file. Once your presentation is complete, you can commit the HTML file to source control alongside your demo code.\nPreviewing the Presentation\nNow, for the easy part, show the presentation to your audience. Start by right-clicking the newly created HTML file and choosing Open In | Browser | Built-in Preview.\n\n\n\n\nThe new presentation will appear inside your IDE using MARP’s presentation engine, which lets you move slides back and forth.\n\n\n\n\nMARP also supports syntax highlighting, so we can present code blocks, but you also have the IDE for that.\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our marp script, we passed the --html flag, allowing raw HTML to render in our presentations. This will enable us to embed any HTML, including scripts for Mermaid rendering. This is very powerful. For folks looking to be extra, you could also write custom JavaScript components and use them in the presentation.\n\n\n\n\nFor those needing speaker notes, you can press P on your keyboard to open an additional presentation window with all your notes. This extra window can be on a secondary display and control the presentation displayed in the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhile previews default to a side-by-side display in the IDE, you can also drag the tab into a group for a full-sized viewing experience.\n\n\n\n\nIn this mode, you can also use your IDE’s tab-switching shortcuts to switch back and forth between the slides and the IDE.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, with ingenuity and the features already found in the IDE, we can create a new style of presenting important technical content to our community. MARP is an excellent open-source project, and this article scratches the surface of what’s possible. Please try this out next time you’re building a presentation.\nAlso, if you’re a JetBrains user creating technical community content around the JetBrains line of products, please check out the JetBrains Community Contributor program.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Have you ever wondered what’s happening under the hood of your .NET application? Do you want to quickly and easily identify and fix performance bottlenecks? If so, Visual Studio has the perfect tool for you: the profiler.\nThe profiler allows you to analyze your code’s performance, pinpoint hot paths, detect memory leaks, address thread contention, and more. It helps you measure CPU usage, memory consumption, and file activity, and lets you drill down into specific methods and lines of code.\nBut what if the code you need to profile isn’t yours? What if it’s a third-party library, a NuGet package, or a framework component without source code access? How can you uncover what’s happening inside those black boxes?\nThat’s where the new auto-decompilation feature comes in handy.\n\nWith Visual Studio 2022, the profiler can automatically decompile the .NET code that you don’t have the source code for and show you the decompiled C# or Visual Basic code in the source view. This way, you can gain insights into the code’s structure and performance issues, even without loaded symbols or exact file locations.\nThis feature is particularly helpful when dealing with non-user external code, empowering you to analyze and optimize your application’s performance effectively, thus enhancing your development workflow.\nHow to Use Auto-Decompilation in Visual Studio Profiler\nTo use this feature, make sure Automatically decompile code during source lookup in the Tools > Options > Debugging > General settings is enabled. Then, you can launch the profiler from the Debug > Performance Profiler menu, or by pressing Alt+F2.\nOnce the profiler is running, you can select the type of analysis you want to perform, such as CPU Sampling, Memory Usage, or .NET Object Allocation Tracking. The profiler will collect the data and display it in various views, such as Call Tree, Functions, Modules, or Caller/Callee. You can also use filters, search, and grouping options to narrow down the results.\n\nTo view the source code of a function, simply double-click on it in any of the views, or right-click and select “Go To Source.” If the source code is available, the profiler will open it in the editor. If not, the profiler will attempt to decompile the code and display it in a read-only window. This allows you to inspect the code, view line numbers, and navigate to the callers and callees.\nAdditionally, you can compare snapshots of the same function taken at different times to see how the code has changed. This helps you identify performance regressions or improvements and understand the impact of your code changes.\nKeep in mind that decompiled code may not be identical to the original, as some information can be lost during compilation. However, the decompiled code should be close enough to provide a good understanding of what the code does and how it impacts your app’s performance\nWe Want to Hear from You\nWe hope you find this feature useful in improving the performance of your .NET applications. We are committed to enhancing Visual Studio and greatly value your feedback. Please share your thoughts on this feature and any suggestions or issues by using the Help > Send Feedback > Report a Problem or Provide a Suggestion options in Visual Studio, or by leaving a comment below.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 continues to be faster with each version. In this blog post we will highlight a couple of the more significant enhancements you’ll experience in 17.11, such as a more efficient C# language service, faster conditional breakpoints and symbol searches in C++.\nReduced CPU usage by C# language service\nCode Indexing\nIn 17.10 we revamped the code indexing system in the C# language service (Roslyn). It used to be both aggressive and highly intermittent.  This would lead to high spikes of CPU usage, taking resources away from the operations users were performing, especially during times like solution load.  After opening a solution, users who wanted to wait for VS to settle would have to wait up to minutes watching a progress bar titled “Running low priority background processes”.\nNow, we no longer preemptively run all the indexers.  Instead, individual ones are run on demand.  In 17.11, these indexers were further streamlined, and made much more incremental, allowing them to consume far less resources when absorbing any change into the index. In addition, there were memory allocation optimizations throughout the editor and managed language services. The net effect of this is a more responsive VS that is ready to go at a much sooner time, with much lower CPU consumption.\nSource Generators\nAs part of our continued work to break VS into isolated, high performance, services, Roslyn’s Source Generator execution host was moved out of the main VS process to a high-performance .NET 8 host.  This helps make VS more resilient to bugs in source generators and allows them to execute much more efficiently.  As part of this work, we also changed the execution model for source generators to no longer run automatically, due to the heavy impact that some generators can still have on the system.  Instead, by default, generators will now run when a document is saved, or a project is built, greatly cutting down on the impact of all generators (especially very expensive ones).  This behavior can be controlled here:\nTools > Options > Text Editor > C# > Advanced > Source Generators\n\nWith the above changes in place, our data shows improved metrics in 17.11. CPU usage is down by 16% percent or more in sessions that had heaviest CPU usage. The C# completion list now appears sooner; looking at the slowest sessions the number of times the list takes longer than 0.5 seconds to appear has been cut by about 40%.\nImproved conditional breakpoint performance\nIn 17.11 we made several changes to improve the performance of conditional breakpoints in C++. The improvements were primarily in two categories:\nAvoiding expensive Windows debugging API calls. Windows calls to get and set information about the debugged process can be expensive, so the data was cached to reduce the number of calls to these APIs. Additionally, some of the information was already available through other sources, allowing some calls to be eliminated entirely.\nReducing data fetched from the debugged process. When a breakpoint is hit, the debugger must fetch a lot of information about the state of the debugged process. This is needed to populate things such as the locals tool window, the Diagnostics Tools window etc. However, to evaluate whether a conditional breakpoint’s conditions have been met, we need only a subset of that information. Now we fetch only the necessary pieces of information.\nWith these optimizations in place, we measured up to ~67% reduction in debugger overhead in a test application compared to 17.10.\nOptimized Symbol Search for C++ language service\nIn 17.11 we reimplemented the text indexing system for C++ symbols. Before this change, C++ language service processed the symbol text directly to answer All-in-one-Search (AIOS) queries. We would load all the text into memory and traverse it to find matching candidates. This approach was relatively fast, but not optimal; not to mention having to keep the text cached in memory. In 17.11 we started using SQLite’s FTS5 search extension. The index is computed when the solution is parsed after it is opened, and then the language service can perform Symbol Search without any additional loading of text into memory. All the results are available faster and with less memory usage: we’ve seen the slower AIOS symbol searches up to 65% faster in 17.11. We hope you’re experiencing this improvement in your larger codebases.\nShare your feedback and stay connected with Visual Studio!\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ever wished to assess your code’s performance without repeatedly choosing the target process or executable for each instrumentation profiling session? If so, you’re among many developers who find this task cumbersome and prone to errors, especially when profiling the same target repeatedly.\nWe understand your frustration and have a solution: Visual Studio 2022 introduces a new feature that addresses this issue. The instrumentation tool now remembers your target selection across runs, providing a seamless experience and enhancing the continuity of your profiling sessions.\n\nWith this improvement, you can maintain your specified target across multiple instrumentation runs, eliminating the need for repetitive selection tasks. This means you can focus more on analyzing the performance data and optimizing your code, rather than wasting time and effort on setting up the profiling session.\nHow does it work?\nTo use this feature, you need to have Visual Studio installed and the Performance Profiler (ALT+F2) enabled. Then, follow these simple steps:\nLaunch the Performance Profiler and select Instrumentation as the profiling method.\nClick the Target button and choose the process or executable you want to profile.\nClick Start to begin the profiling session. Visual Studio will collect and display the performance data in the Diagnostic Tools window.\nWhen you’re done, click Stop to end the profiling session. Visual Studio will show you a summary of the results and allow you to drill down into the details.\nClick cancel in the dialog box to reset the persisted selection.\nIf you want to run another instrumentation profiling session on the same target, you don’t need to select it again. Just click Start and Visual Studio will remember your last choice and use it as the default target. When you add a new method, class, or project, these new targets are automatically selected based on whether their parent was previously selected. This proactive approach ensures that no new additions are missed and helps maintain comprehensive profiling coverage.\nYou can still change the target if you want to, but you don’t have to.\n\nEnjoy the convenience and efficiency of persistent target selection!\nWhy should you use it?\nThis feature is designed to help you streamline your workflow and improve your productivity when using the instrumentation tool. By persisting the target selection between runs, you can:\nSave time and avoid frustration by reducing the number of clicks and interactions needed to set up a profiling session.\nMinimize the risk of selecting the wrong target or forgetting to select one, which could lead to inaccurate or missing performance data.\nMaintain consistency and comparability of the performance data across multiple profiling sessions on the same target.\nFocus more on the performance analysis and optimization of your code, rather than the configuration and management of the profiling session.\nConcluding thoughts\nWe hope you find this feature valuable for your development journey. Your feedback and suggestions are invaluable to us as we strive to enhance it further. Please share your thoughts through the Visual Studio Developer Community or the Report a Problem tool in Visual Studio.\nThank you for choosing Visual Studio and for your continuous feedback that helps us make it better every day.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nThe post Effortless Instrumentation profiling with Persistent Target Selection appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 BIM(Building Information Modeling) 포맷 중 하나인 IFC 파일을 Cesium 플랫폼에 3D tiles로 가시화하는 방법을 간략히 설명한다. 아울러, 마지막 부분에 3D tiles 개념과 구조를 간략히 나눔한다. Cesium에서 개발된 3D tiles는 3D 고속 렌더링을 위한 모델 구조와 렌더링 메커니즘을 제공한다. 이 기술은 현재 공간정보산업표준을 담당하는 OGC(Open Geospatial Consortium)와 유기적 협력을 통해 발전하고 있다.\n\n\nCesium 3D tiles 가시화 모습 예시\n\n개요\nCesium은 구글 어스와 유사한 지구 스케일의 디지털트윈 플랫폼이다. 이를 이용하면, 도시 차원에서 분석하고, 실내 건물을 탐색하는 등의 유스케이스를 개발할 수 있다. 국내 대부분의 3차원 도시 플랫폼 기반 서비스에서 Cesium이 사용되고 있다. Cesium은 디지털트윈 모델을 다루기 위한 저작도구도 함께 제공한다. 개발자는 서비스에 필요한 메뉴 기능, 데쉬보드에 표출한 데이터 처리에만 신경을 쓰면 된다. \n\n\nCesium 저작도구 예시\n\n공간정보 기술을 연구하다 보면, 가끔 BIM 파일 포맷 중 하나 인 IFC(Industry Foundation Classes)를 Cesium위에 가시화해야 하는 경우가 종종 발생할 때가 있다. 하지만, Cesium은 IFC를 직접적으로 지원하지 않는다. \n\n\nIFC 추가 에러 발생 모습\n\nCesium은 IFC를 포함한 모든 3D 모델파일을 3D tiles로 변환해 업로드하도록 하고 있다. 이는 무거운 3D 모델의 가시화 성능을 고려한 것이다. \n\n\n3D tiles은 웹에서 가시화하기에 무거운 3D 파일을 공간인덱싱 기법을 이용해 Octree형식으로 표현하고, 각 노트에 분할된 3D 모델의 부분을 담아둔다. 메쉬 간략화 기법을 이용해, 카메라가 모델을 비추는 거리에 따라 적절한 LoD(Level of Detail)의 메쉬를 보여준다. 이는 게임에서 FPS 성능을 올리기 위해 개발된 기법과 매우 유사하다. glTF 20은 3D 타일의 기본 형식이다. \n\n\nglTF 2.0 기능(3차원 점군, 텍스쳐, 모델 지원 예시)\n\n\nCesium은 다양한 샘플 코드를 sandcastle이란 플랫폼으로 제공하여, 편리한 개발을 지원하고 있다.\n\n\nCode Examples – Cesium\n\n\n3D tile 모델 변환 및 업로드\n먼저, 다음 링크를 방문해 Cesium ion 에 가입한다.\n\nCesium ion – Cesium\n\n이후, 세슘의 API, 어셋(asset)을 관리하는 클라우드, Javascript 기반 예제 등을 무료로 사용할 수 있다. 여기서 어셋이란 플랫폼에서 사용하는 GIS, BIM 등 모든 파일 및 데이터셋을 의미한다. 가입 후, 아래를 클릭해 어셋을 추가해 보자. \n\nStories | Cesium ion\n\n\n\nCesium ion 메뉴 화면\n\n\n\nCesium은 3D 모델을 3차원 타일 형식으로 내부 표현한다. 이 형식을 지원하는 파일 포맷은 다음과 같다. \n\n\nIFC를 fbx와 같은 형식으로 변환한 후, My Assets 메뉴(My Assets | Cesium ion)를 이용해 데이터를 추가한다. 추가된 데이터는 고유의 Asset ID가 부여된다. 다음 그림에서 첫 행의 어셋인 2716386은 어셋 ID를 보여준다. 현재 세슘은 5GB 무료 어셋 저장소를 제공한다.\n\n\n\n\n참고로, IFC파일을 다른 형식으로 변환하기 위해서는 Revit 등 상용 모델러를 사용하거나, Blender와 같은 오픈소스 도구에 IFC import 애드인을 설치하고, fbx 포맷 등으로 저장하면 된다. \n\nBlender에서 IFC to FBX 변환 모습\n3차원 모델은 좌표 원점에 표시되므로, 모델의 원점과 각도를 재조정해야 한다. \n\n\n다음과 같이 MyAssets 메뉴에 Adjust Tileset Location 메뉴를 클릭한다.\n\n\n\n\n참고로, 만약 모델 원점이 0.0.0이 아니면, 다음 그림과 같이 재조정하기 어렵다. 모델링 할 때 원점을 맞추고 진행한다.\n\n\n\n3D Tile Location Editor에서 모델의 위치, 방향을 수정한 후 저장버튼을 클릭한다. 참고로, Click position 버튼을 클릭하면, 현재 커서 위치의 지표면에 맞춰 타일 모델 위치를 자동 입력한다.\n\n\n\n\n앱 서비스 개발\n특정 서비스에 3D tile을 사용하고 싶다면, 단순히 primities.add 함수를 사용하여 3D tile을 추가할 수 있다. API를 사용해야 하므로, API 토큰을 생성 한다. \n\n\nAPI 키 토큰 생성 예시\n\n다음 링크를 참고해, API 키 토큰을 생성하고, 이 문자열을 코드의 Token에 할당한다.\n\nCesium ion Access Tokens – Cesium\n\nHTML를 만들어, 다음 같이 자바스크립트 파일을 입력한다. 어셋 ID를 이용해 fromAssetID에서 어셋을 가져온다.\n\n\n         Cesium.Ion.defaultAccessToken = '';\n         var viewer = new Cesium.Viewer('cesiumContainer', {\n            animation: false,\n            homeButton: true,\n            navigationHelpButton: true\n         });\n\n\n\n         const tileset = viewer.scene.primitives.add(\n            new Cesium.Cesium3DTileset({\n               url: Cesium.IonResource.fromAssetId(1378646),\n            })\n         );\n\n\n\n\n\n3D tile 코드 사용 예시\n\n\n\n웹 서비스에서 코드 호출한 결과는 다음과 같다. 3D tile이 잘 가시화되는 것을 확인할 수 있다.\n\n\n\n\n3D tile 구조\n\nCesium의 3D Tiles 데이터 구조는 대규모 3D 지리 데이터를 효율적으로 스트리밍하고 시각화하기 위해 설계되었다. 3D Tiles 구조는 오픈소스로 다음 깃허브 링크에 공개되어 있다. \n\nCesiumGS/3d-tiles: Specification for streaming massive heterogeneous 3D geospatial datasets :earth_americas: (github.com)\n3D Tiles Specification (ogc.org)\n\n\n\n\n타일 데이터셋은 다음과 같다.\n\nTileset\n\n\n\n\nTileset.json 파일이 3D 타일의 상위 구성 파일 역할을 하며, 타일 계층 구조와 데이터 위치 정보를 담고 있다. 이 파일은 전체 타일셋의 메타데이터와 루트 타일에 대한 참조를 제공한다. \n\n\n {\n  \"transform\": [\n     4.843178171884396,   1.2424271388626869, 0,                  0,\n    -0.7993325488216595,  3.1159251367235608, 3.8278032889280675, 0,\n     0.9511533376784163, -3.7077466670407433, 3.2168186118075526, 0,\n     1215001.7612985559, -4736269.697480114,  4081650.708604793,  1\n  ],\n  \"boundingVolume\": {\n    \"box\": [\n      0,     0,    6.701,\n      3.738, 0,    0,\n      0,     3.72, 0,\n      0,     0,    13.402\n    ]\n  },\n  \"geometricError\": 32,\n  \"content\": {\n    \"uri\": \"building.b3dm\"\n  },\n  \"extensions\": {\n    \"VENDOR_collision_volume\": {\n      \"box\": [\n        0,     0,    6.8,\n        3.8,   0,    0,\n        0,     3.8,  0,\n        0,     0,    13.5\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n타일 계층 구조\n\n\n\n\n타일 계층은 루트 타일에서 시작해 더 작은 타일로 분할되며, 쿼드트리나 옥트리 구조를 사용한다. 타일들은 자신보다 작은 자식 타일들을 가지며, 각각의 해상도가 다르다.\n\n\n\n루트 타일은 대략적인 모델 데이터를 제공하고, 자식 타일은 줌 인할 때 더 높은 해상도를 제공한다.\n\n\n\n\n타일 구성 요소\n\n\n\n\nBounding Volume (경계 볼륨)은 각 타일이 포함하는 공간 영역을 정의한다. 이 경계는 카메라의 위치에 따라 타일을 로드할지 결정하는 데 사용된다.\n\n\n\nGeometric Error (기하학적 오차)는 타일의 해상도와 관련된 값으로, 클라이언트가 어떤 타일을 로드할지 선택하는 데 도움을 준다.\n\n\n\n\n타일 콘텐츠\n\n\n\n\n타일은 다양한 형태의 3D 데이터를 포함할 수 있다.\n\n\n\nBatched 3D Model (B3DM)은 여러 개의 3D 객체를 포함한 배치된 모델이다.\n\n\nInstanced 3D Model (I3DM)은 동일한 3D 모델을 여러 위치에 인스턴스화하여 사용한다.\n\n\nPoint Cloud (PNTS)는 점군 데이터를 포함한다.\n\n\nComposite (CMPT)는 다양한 콘텐츠를 하나의 타일에 혼합할 수 있다.\n\n\n\n\nLOD (Level of Detail)\n\n\n\n\n3D Tiles는 LOD(세부 수준)에 따라 계층 구조를 가지며, 줌 수준에 따라 더 높은 해상도의 타일을 로드하거나, 멀리 있는 객체는 낮은 해상도를 유지함으로써 성능을 최적화한다.\n\n\n\n\n압축 및 최적화\n\n\n\n\nCesium의 3D Tiles는 데이터를 압축하여 전송 속도와 메모리 효율성을 높인다.\n\n\n\nDraco 압축을 사용하여 기하학 데이터를 압축하고 파일 크기를 줄인다.\n\n\n이처럼 Cesium의 3D Tiles 구조는 대규모 지리 데이터를 효율적으로 처리하고 동적으로 로드하여 성능을 극대화한다.\n\n\n\n\n다음은 앞의 구조를 표현한 그림이다.\n\n\nSegmentation Pipeline for 3D Tiles\n\n다음 그림은 3D 타일 공식 포맷인 glTF 2.0의 구조와 개념을 상세히 보여준다. \n\n\nKhronosGroup/glTF: glTF – Runtime 3D Asset Delivery (github.com)\n\n레퍼런스\n\nTiler Data Types and Formats – Cesium\nUpload with REST – Cesium\nSet Location for Data Uploaded to Cesium ion – Cesium\nCesiumJS Quickstart – Cesium\n3d-tiles/extensions at main · CesiumGS/3d-tiles (github.com)",

Semantic Versioning 과 Conventional Commit는 널리 알려진 릴리즈와 버저닝 전략이기에 프로덕션 레벨의 소프트웨어 릴리즈 관리에 관심이 있다면 한 번 쯤 들어봤을 것이다. 이 글은 SemVer와 Conventional Commit 을 이용하여 CI 단계에서 릴리즈와 버저닝을 자동화하는 구글의 Release Please를 소개하고, GitHub Actions를 이용하여 프로젝트에 적용하는 방법을 소개한다.\n뭔가 많이 바뀐 것 같으니 2.0이라고 할게요\n\n\n\n\n소프트웨어 버저닝 체계가 갖춰지지 않았던 시절, 버전 넘버는 퍼스널 컬러처럼 그날의 개발자 기분에 따라 정성적으로 정해졌다. \n뭔가 많이 바뀐 것 같은 느낌이 들면 2.0, 별로 한게 없다는 생각이 들어서 1.1, \n바뀌긴 바꼈는데 임시로 떼운 코드라 넘버링을 하고 싶지 않으면 1.0-a, \n근데 또 어떤 날은 버전명에 의미를 담고 싶어서 1.0-a-opengl-windows-x64, \n이전 릴리즈랑 다르게 이름붙여야 해서 git hash를 곁들인 1.0-a-f917bc …\n출처: 침하하\n\n\n\n이런 ad-hoc 한 버전 정보는 사용자에게 ‘뭔가 바꼈구나’라는 것 외에는 어떤 유용함도 제공하지 않는다. ad-hoc versioning의 진짜 문제는 의존성을 관리할 때 발생한다. 1.0-a 를 1.0-opengl-f917bc 로 변경할 때 의존성 문제가 발생하는지 여부는 오롯이 라이브러리를 가져다 쓴 사용자가 책임져야 한다.\nSemVer : 버전 정보에 의미를 담다\n출처: devopsschool.com\n\n\n\n2011년 9월, GitHub의 공동 창업자 Tom Preston-Werner는 Semantic Versioning(이하 SemVer) Spec 1.0.0을 공개했다. SemVer와 이전의 버저닝 규칙과의 분명한 차이점은 버전 정보 만으로도 이전 버전과의 호환성 여부를 판별할 수 있게 되었다는 것이다. 이는 자동화 관점에서 매우 중요하다. 왜냐하면 의존성 관리를 자동화할 수 있기 때문이다.\n버전 증가 규칙\nMAJOR 버전\n\n이전 버전과 호환되지 않는 API 변경 시 증가\nMINOR 버전\n\n이전 버전과 호환되는 기능 추가 시 증가\nPATCH를 0으로 초기화\nPATCH 버전\n\n이전 버전과 호환되는 버그 수정 시 증가\nMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH 규칙 외에도 Pre-Release 규칙(하이픈 -)이라던지 메타데이터 규칙(더하기+) 등 몇 가지 세세한 규칙이 있는데, 자세한 것은 SemVer 2 스펙을 확인하자.(링크: https://semver.org/lang/ko/)\nConventional Commit : 사람도 기계도 모두 이해할 수 있는 커밋 메세지\n\n\n\n\n앞서 SemVer가 호환성에 영향을 주는 변경을 추적하는 규칙임을 설명하였는데, 현대 소프트웨어 개발에서 변경의 최소 단위는 commit이라 할 수 있다. 여러 개발자의 commit 이력이 모여 소프트웨어 릴리즈의 변경사항을 구성한다면, commit message에도 SemVer처럼 작성 규칙을 정해둘 수 있지 않을까?\nAngular 프로젝트는 Change log를 자동 생성하기 위해 Commit Message Guidelines 를 제안하였고, 이는 Conventional Commit 표준에 큰 영향을 주었다.\n<타입>[적용 범위(선택 사항)]: <설명>\n< 빈 칸 >\n[본문(선택 사항)]\n<빈 칸>\n[꼬리말(선택 사항)]\nAngular 포맷에 많은 영향을 받은 탓인지, Angular 포맷과 Conventional Commit 의 커밋 메세지 구조는 거의 비슷하다. 메세지 헤더에 해당 커밋의 타입이 무엇인지( fix / feature / BREAKING CHANGE 등등…) 기술하고 공백 라인을 추가한 후, 구체적인 내용을 작성하는 구조이다. 경우에 따라 꼬리말(=footer)을 작성하거나 생략할 수 있다.\nConventional Commit 과 Angular 포맷의 결정적인 차이는 의무화되는 커밋 타입의 종류가 얼마나 많은지 여부이다. 상술하였듯, 커밋 메세지 포맷을 구조화하는 가장 큰 목적은 호환성에 영향을 주는 변경을 추적하기 위함이다. 따라서 다음 3가지 type 외에 나머지는 반드시 지켜야 하는 커밋 타입이 아니다.\nfeat: (=MINOR)\nfix: (=PATCH)\nBREAKING CHANGE: (=MAJOR)\nfix: prevent racing of requests\n\nIntroduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss\nincoming responses other than from latest request.\n\nRemove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are\nobsolete now.\n\nReviewed-by: Z\nRefs: #123\n프로젝트에 Conventional Commit 규칙을 도입하였을 때 가장 좋은 점은 릴리즈 버저닝과 Change log 생성을 자동화할 수 있다는 것이다.\nPR을 머지하는 시점에 우리는 어떤 커밋 이력이 이번 릴리즈에 포함되어 있는지 정확히 파악할 수 있다.\nCommit log 헤더가 <fix:> 로 시작한다면, PATCH 버전을 올린다.\nCommit log 헤더가 <feature:> 로 시작한다면, MINOR 버전을 올린다.\nCommit log footer가 <BREAKING CHANGE:> 로 시작하거나 타입 뒤에 !표기가 있다면, MAJOR 버전을 올린다.\n\n\n\n\n이런 식으로 자동화된 버저닝 & CHANGELOG를 얻을 수 있다.\n\n\n\n\n\n근데 이제 Release Please Actions를 곁들인…\n많은 오픈소스 프로젝트에서 Conventional Commit 과 SemVer 규칙을 따르기 때문에 익숙한 내용이었을 것으로 생각한다. 필자가 소개하려는 도구는 Google에서 제공하는 Release Please이다. (링크: https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) Conventional Commit 규칙을 따르는 프로젝트의 CHANGELOG와 SemVer 규칙에 맞는 Bump up을 자동화해주는 유용한 도구다. 특히 GitHub Actions 와 함께 사용하면 프로덕션 레벨의 소프트웨어 릴리즈 관리를 자동화할 수 있다.\n(공식적으로도 GitHub Actions를 추천한다. 하지만 CLI 와 GitHub App도 지원을 한다.)\nRelease Please 의 기본 설정대로 구성하였을 때의 플로우는 다음과 같다.\nRelease Please 봇이 생성한 Release PR\n\n\n\n\nPR 생성(from 개발자) → 리뷰 후 Approve → main 브랜치에 머지\nRelease PR 생성(from 봇)  → main 브랜치에 머지\n\nRelease PR에는 version tag, CHANGELOG 등의 정보가 포함\n추가적으로 다른 필요한 동작을 설정할 수도 있음(e.g. docker registry push 등)\nRelease 생성 → Bump up 된 버전 tag 와 CHANGELOG 등을 바탕으로\n특히, 잘 알려진 언어 / 패키지 매니저는 쓰기 편하도록 release-type을 지정하여 버전 정보를 관리할 수 있다.(e.g. nodejs를 쓰는 경우 package.json 정보도 함께 자동 갱신)\n다음은 지원하는 언어 / release-type 목록이다.(링크: https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action?tab=readme-ov-file#release-types-supported)\n\nrelease typedescription\n\ndartA repository with a pubspec.yaml and a CHANGELOG.md\nelixirAn elixir repository with a mix.exs and a CHANGELOG.md\nexpoAn Expo based React Native repository, with a package.json, app.json and CHANGELOG.md\ngoGo repository, with a CHANGELOG.md\nhelmA helm chart repository with a Chart.yaml and a CHANGELOG.md\njavaA strategy that generates SNAPSHOT version after each release\nkrm-blueprintA kpt package, with 1 or more KRM files and a CHANGELOG.md\nmavenStrategy for Maven projects, generates SNAPSHOT version after each release and updates pom.xml automatically\nnodeA Node.js repository, with a package.json and CHANGELOG.md\nocamlAn OCaml repository, containing 1 or more opam or esy files and a CHANGELOG.md\npythonA Python repository, with a setup.py, setup.cfg, version.py and CHANGELOG.md and optionally a pyproject.toml and a <project>/__init__.py\nphpA php composer package with composer.json and CHANGELOG.md\nrubyA Ruby repository, with version.rb and CHANGELOG.md\nrustA Rust repository, with a Cargo.toml (either as a crate or workspace) and a CHANGELOG.md\nsfdxA repository with a sfdx-project.json and a CHANGELOG.md\nsimpleA repository with a version.txt and a CHANGELOG.md\nterraform-moduleA terraform module, with a version in the README.md, and a CHANGELOG.md\n\n\n\n\n\nReleas Please는 잘 만들어진 도구답게, 워크플로우 단계의 꽤 많은 것들을 커스터마이즈할 수 있다.\n하지만 기본적인 워크플로우 및 제공되는 기능으로도 충분하다.\n결론\n지금까지 소프트웨어 릴리즈 및 버저닝을 위한 SemVer와 Conventional Commit을 알아보고, 이를 통해 릴리즈 관리를 자동화할 수 있는 도구인 Release Please 를 알아보았다.\n프로덕션 레벨로 소프트웨어 릴리즈 관리를 하고 싶은 분들에게 도움이 되었으면 한다.",

기술의 발전과 함께, 여러 작업에서 AI의 지원을 받는 사례가 점점 더 늘어나고 있습니다. 특히 챗GPT는 자연어 처리 능력을 바탕으로 문서 작성, 코딩 등의 작업에서 큰 도움을 주고 있습니다. 그런데 이제 OpenAI는 여기에서 한 걸음 더 나아가, 새로운 협업 도구인 &lsquo;캔버스&rsquo;를 발표했습니다. 이 도구는 단순한 질문과 답변을 넘어서, 실질적인 프로젝트 작업 과정에 AI가 직접 참여하는 새로운 경험을 제공합니다. 기존의 챗GPT는 대화형 인터페이스에 머물러 있었지만, 캔버스는 그 한계를 뛰어넘어 사용자와 AI 간의 협업을 극대화하는 도구로 설계되었습니다. 이를 통해 OpenAI는 더욱 효율적이고 완성도 높은 프로젝트 작업 환경을 제공하고자 합니다.</p>\n<p

        "contentSnippet": "Microsoft Edge의 PDF 리더 기능은 주석 추가, 텍스트 음성 변환, 번역, 검색 기능 등 다양한 기능을 제공하여 최고의 브라우저 PDF 리더로 자리 잡았습니다.\n \n\n\n \n \n PDF 파일을 읽기 위해 다양한 앱들이 존재하지만, 대부분의 PDF 파일이 인터넷에서 제공되는 만큼 브라우저에서 PDF 파일을 바로 읽을 수 있는 기능은 매우 유용합니다. 여러 브라우저의 PDF 리더 기능을 사용해 본 결과, Microsoft Edge의 PDF 리더가 가장 많은 기능과 편의성을 제공해 최고의 선택으로 떠오르고 있습니다. 이 글에서는 Microsoft Edge의 PDF 리더가 왜 다른 브라우저의 PDF 리더보다 뛰어난지 6가지 이유를 통해 살펴보겠습니다.\n \n1. 주석 추가 기능\n\n\nPDF 리더에서 가장 중요한 기능 중 하나가 바로 주석 기능입니다. Microsoft Edge는 무료로 제공되며, PDF 파일의 특정 부분에 간단하게 주석을 추가할 수 있습니다. 주석이 추가된 텍스트는 자동으로 하이라이트 처리되어 나중에 쉽게 찾아볼 수 있어 편리합니다. 이 기능은 유료 PDF 리더와 견주어도 전혀 손색이 없습니다.\n \n \n2. 텍스트 음성 변환 기능\n\n\nMicrosoft Edge의 PDF 리더는 텍스트 음성 변환 기능을 포함하고 있습니다. 이 기능은 학습 자료나 리서치 페이퍼를 읽을 때 오디오북처럼 사용할 수 있어 매우 유용합니다. 다양한 음성 선택 옵션과 읽기 속도 조절 기능을 제공하여, 개인의 취향에 맞게 맞출 수 있습니다. 이 기능 덕분에 책을 읽지 않고도 내용을 파악할 수 있어 시간 절약에 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n \n \n \n3. 내장 번역 기능\n\n\nMicrosoft Edge의 PDF 리더에는 텍스트 번역 기능이 내장되어 있습니다. 텍스트의 일부를 선택하고 상단 메뉴에서 번역 아이콘을 클릭하면 원본 언어를 자동으로 감지하고 원하는 언어로 번역할 수 있습니다. 인터넷 연결이 필요하지만, 다른 브라우저에서는 찾기 힘든 독특한 기능입니다.\n \n \n4. 텍스트 편집 기능\n\n\nPDF 파일에서 텍스트를 편집할 수 있는 기능도 Microsoft Edge에 내장되어 있습니다. 텍스트의 색상, 크기, 간격 등을 커스터마이징할 수 있어 PDF 양식을 작성하거나 개인 메모를 추가하는 데 유용합니다. 이미지 위에 텍스트를 추가할 수도 있어 다양한 상황에서 활용 가능합니다.\n \n \n5. 전용 PDF 검색 기능\n\n\n \n 대부분의 브라우저는 Ctrl+F 를 통해 검색 기능을 제공하지만, Microsoft Edge는 PDF 파일에서 쉽게 검색할 수 있는 전용 아이콘을 제공하여 검색의 편의성을 높였습니다. 상단의 검색 아이콘을 통해 빠르게 원하는 텍스트를 찾아볼 수 있으며, 검색어의 발생 위치를 한눈에 확인할 수 있습니다.\n \n \n6. 그리기 및 하이라이트 기능\n\n\n \n PDF 파일을 읽을 때 텍스트를 강조하거나 직접 그릴 수 있는 기능이 Microsoft Edge에 포함되어 있습니다. 다양한 색상의 펜을 선택할 수 있으며, 두께 조절도 가능합니다. 하이라이트 기능도 지원되며, 이를 통해 중요한 내용을 쉽게 강조할 수 있습니다. 만약 실수로 잘못 그렸다면 지우개 기능을 사용해 간단히 수정할 수 있습니다.\n \n이 외에도 Microsoft Edge는 두 페이지 보기, 목차 보기, 확대/축소 기능, 페이지 회전 및 내비게이터와 같은 기본적인 PDF 리더 기능도 충실히 제공하고 있어, 다양한 상황에서 활용할 수 있는 완벽한 브라우저 기반 PDF 리더입니다.\n \n \n결론\nMicrosoft Edge는 주석 추가, 텍스트 음성 변환, 번역, 텍스트 편집, 그리기 및 하이라이트 등 매우 다양한 기능을 제공하며, 특히 PDF 파일을 많이 사용하는 사람들에게 최적의 선택입니다. 이 모든 기능들이 무료로 제공되기 때문에 다른 유료 PDF 리더와 비교해도 전혀 부족함이 없습니다. 편리함과 다양한 기능을 고려했을 때, Microsoft Edge의 PDF 리더가 최고의 브라우저 PDF 리더로 추천될 수밖에 없는 이유입니다.",

href=\"https://zzsza.github.io/diary/2020/10/04/geultto-4th-retrospect/\">글또 4기 운영 회고 및 글또 5기를 준비하며 쓰는 글</a>. 벌써 4년 전이고, 그 사이에 4년이나 지났다니 시간이 참 빠르다\n    <ul>\n      <li>이 시기엔 회사를 다니면서 커뮤니티를 운영하고 있어서 엄청 새로운 것을 많이 시도하지 않았던 시기</li>\n      <li>코로나도 있었고, 온라인 상황에서 할 수 있는 것을 조금씩 진행했다</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>글또는 시스템적으로 매 기수 많이 발전하고 있는데, 8기 때 또봇이 처음 등장했다\n    <ul>\n      <li>또봇이 등장한 후, 이모지를 남겨서 글을 체크하는 방식 대신 별도의 모달을 통해 글을 제출하는 방식으로 변했다</li>\n      <li>사람들이 이모지를 누락했던 케이스가 사라지고, 점점 더 시스템적으로 제출할 수 있게 되었다</li>\n      <li>그리고 글또는 매번 기수가 진행되면서 계속 디벨롭을 해왔고, 10기 때도 새로운 시스템이 생겼다</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">포인트 시스템</code>\n    <ul>\n      <li>또봇을 만들어주신 은찬님과 구의 탐탐에서 이야기를 할 때 포인트 시스템에 대해 이야기를 했다\n        <ul>\n          <li>은찬님이 이야기를 듣고 흥미롭게 들어주셨고, 빠르게 구현을 해주셨다.</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>과거부터 어떻게 해야 사람들이 더 재미있게 글또에 참여할 수 있을까?를 고민했고 게이미피케이션을 도입하면 어떨까 싶었다</li>\n      <li>포인트로 직관적으로 보여주고 그것을 활용할 수 있도록 하고 싶었다</li>\n      <li>글또의 활동을 통해 명시적으로 보이는 것이 “글”이였다면, 이젠 글이 아니어도 포인트나 관계를 보여줄 수 있게 되었다</li>\n      <li>9기 때 데달부(현 CRM 크루)에게 Push 메시지를 보내면서 사람들이 커뮤니티에서 얼마나 글을 작성하고, 어떤 관계를 맺었는지 보여주게 되었다</li>\n      <li>개발 관점에선 데이터 로깅을 배치로 진행하다가 실시간으로 하는 것으로 변했다. 이건 데이터 직무를 하는 사람들 관점에서도 흥미롭게 들을 수 있을 것 같아서, 언젠가 발표로 풀지 않을까 싶다. 직접 개발을 하지 않았지만 아키텍쳐 설계를 할 때 은찬님에게 가이드를 드렸다.</li>\n      <li>글을 제출할 때, 공지사항에 이모지를 남길 때, 특정 조건을 달성할 때 포인트를 지급하는 구조로 만들었다\n        <ul>\n          <li>사람들의 사용 데이터를 보면서 기능을 조금씩 추가하고 있다</li>\n          <li>글 제출을 1등으로 할 때 포인트, 연속으로 글을 작성할 때 콤보 등. 게임 기획을 위한 책도 보고 고민도 하며 만들고 있다</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n

    <li>9기 땐 감사함을 외치는 것을 해보려고 했으나, 이게 잘 동작하기 쉽지 않았다. 누군가에게 감사함을 표시하는 것도 용기가 필요한 일이기에</li>\n      <li>그래서 감사함을 표시할 수 있는 매개체를 만들고, 그것을 전달하는 것을 생각했다. 포인트 시스템과 연계해서 포인트를 전달할 수 있게 하려고 했으나 기획하다보니 포인트를 주는 것보다 별도로 감사함을 전달하는게 더 좋을 것 같아 감사함을 표시할 수 있도록 했다</li>\n      <li>이게 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">종이비행기</code>로 탄생했다\n        <ul>\n          <li>누군가에게 종이비행기를 보내고, 사람들은 자신이 보낸, 받은

        "contentSnippet": "글 쓰는 개발자 모임 - 글또 10기가 시작되었습니다\n저는 글또 5기까지엔 글을 작성하고, 6기~9기 때는 글또를 운영하는 것에 초점을 맞췄습니다. 운영자 관점에서 참여하다보니 글이 없었는데, 10기는 마지막이니! 의미를 담아 다시 글을 작성하려고 합니다\n글또 10기 참여자 관점, 운영자 관점의 다짐을 공유합니다\n글또 10기\n마지막으로 작성했던 글또 회고, 다짐 글이 언제인가 찾아보니 글또 4기 운영 회고 및 글또 5기를 준비하며 쓰는 글. 벌써 4년 전이고, 그 사이에 4년이나 지났다니 시간이 참 빠르다\n    \n이 시기엔 회사를 다니면서 커뮤니티를 운영하고 있어서 엄청 새로운 것을 많이 시도하지 않았던 시기\n코로나도 있었고, 온라인 상황에서 할 수 있는 것을 조금씩 진행했다\n글또는 시스템적으로 매 기수 많이 발전하고 있는데, 8기 때 또봇이 처음 등장했다\n    \n또봇이 등장한 후, 이모지를 남겨서 글을 체크하는 방식 대신 별도의 모달을 통해 글을 제출하는 방식으로 변했다\n사람들이 이모지를 누락했던 케이스가 사라지고, 점점 더 시스템적으로 제출할 수 있게 되었다\n그리고 글또는 매번 기수가 진행되면서 계속 디벨롭을 해왔고, 10기 때도 새로운 시스템이 생겼다\n포인트 시스템\n    \n또봇을 만들어주신 은찬님과 구의 탐탐에서 이야기를 할 때 포인트 시스템에 대해 이야기를 했다\n        \n은찬님이 이야기를 듣고 흥미롭게 들어주셨고, 빠르게 구현을 해주셨다.\n과거부터 어떻게 해야 사람들이 더 재미있게 글또에 참여할 수 있을까?를 고민했고 게이미피케이션을 도입하면 어떨까 싶었다\n포인트로 직관적으로 보여주고 그것을 활용할 수 있도록 하고 싶었다\n글또의 활동을 통해 명시적으로 보이는 것이 “글”이였다면, 이젠 글이 아니어도 포인트나 관계를 보여줄 수 있게 되었다\n9기 때 데달부(현 CRM 크루)에게 Push 메시지를 보내면서 사람들이 커뮤니티에서 얼마나 글을 작성하고, 어떤 관계를 맺었는지 보여주게 되었다\n개발 관점에선 데이터 로깅을 배치로 진행하다가 실시간으로 하는 것으로 변했다. 이건 데이터 직무를 하는 사람들 관점에서도 흥미롭게 들을 수 있을 것 같아서, 언젠가 발표로 풀지 않을까 싶다. 직접 개발을 하지 않았지만 아키텍쳐 설계를 할 때 은찬님에게 가이드를 드렸다.\n글을 제출할 때, 공지사항에 이모지를 남길 때, 특정 조건을 달성할 때 포인트를 지급하는 구조로 만들었다\n        \n사람들의 사용 데이터를 보면서 기능을 조금씩 추가하고 있다\n글 제출을 1등으로 할 때 포인트, 연속으로 글을 작성할 때 콤보 등. 게임 기획을 위한 책도 보고 고민도 하며 만들고 있다\n\n\n따뜻한 커뮤니티를 만들고 싶었다\n    \n익명 커뮤니티 같은 곳을 보면 점점 차갑고, 냉소적으로 변하는 것을 느낄 수 있었다\n내가 있는 곳은 조금이나마 더 따뜻한 곳이 되길 바라는 마음에 따뜻함을 느낄 수 있도록 커뮤니티를 설계하고 싶었다\n9기 땐 감사함을 외치는 것을 해보려고 했으나, 이게 잘 동작하기 쉽지 않았다. 누군가에게 감사함을 표시하는 것도 용기가 필요한 일이기에\n그래서 감사함을 표시할 수 있는 매개체를 만들고, 그것을 전달하는 것을 생각했다. 포인트 시스템과 연계해서 포인트를 전달할 수 있게 하려고 했으나 기획하다보니 포인트를 주는 것보다 별도로 감사함을 전달하는게 더 좋을 것 같아 감사함을 표시할 수 있도록 했다\n이게 종이비행기로 탄생했다\n        \n누군가에게 종이비행기를 보내고, 사람들은 자신이 보낸, 받은 종이비행기를 확인할 수 있다\n사람들이 서로 종이비행기를 잘 보내려면 잘 연결하는 것이 핵심이라 연결하는 것을 고민 중\n종이비행기 외에 대나무숲은 여전히 따뜻하고, 소모임 채널에서도 잘 활동해주고 계신다\n\n운영진 크루\n    \n운영진은 34분이 계신다. 운영진의 내부 팀을 크루라고 부르는데, 여러가지 역할이 새로 생기기도 하고 과거 운영진을 하셨던 분들이 새로운 것들을 시도하기도 한다\n각 역할이 있고, 그 역할을 수행하면 글또의 전체적인 만족도가 더 올라갈 것을 기대하고 있다\n목적 조직처럼 구성되고 있는 점도 흥미롭고, 각 크루에 계신 분들이 활동을 하시고 그런 내용들을 글또 웹페이지에 기록하는 것을 목표로 하고 있다\n사이드 프로젝트지만 잘 진행할 수도 있다는 것을 보여주고 싶고, 이분들의 커리어도 더 잘 되시면 좋겠다\n운영진 MT도 가는데, 가서 서로 이야기 많이 나눌 수 있길\n마지막으로 운영할 예정이라 잘 마무리하기 위해 커뮤니티를 어떻게 운영하는지에 대한 내용도 전수하려고 하고 있다. 암묵지들을 잘 정리해두고, 이것도 최대한 전수하고 가야겠다는 생각\n오프라인 모임을 매 기수 반상회라고 했었는데, 이번엔 전체가 모이는 행사를 하면 좋지 않을까 생각하고 있다\n640명이 되는 분들이 참여해주셔서, 책임감이 있다. 많은 분들이 하나라도 얻어갈 수 있는 시간이 되길\n글또 관련한 더 자세한 내용은 추후에 글또 웹페이지에 하나씩 정리해서 올릴 예정\n\n글또 10기 운영의 핵심\n글또 비전과 동일하다\n    \n사람들이 글을 잘 작성하도록 돕고\n사람들이 서로 연결될 수 있도록\n2가지가 제일 핵심이라, 이 부분에 대한 내용을 계속 생각한다\n어떤 분들은 글만 쓰고 싶을 수도 있고, 어떤 분들은 사람을 만나고 싶을 것\n    \n제일 핵심인 글쓰기는 모두 다 할 수 있도록 하고, 사람을 만나는 것은 점진적으로 하는 것을 권장할 예정\nMBTI가 I더라도 사람들은 만날 수 있다. 만나기까지 힘든데, 막상 만나면 좋은 경험을 했다라는 글을 많이 봤다\n소모임 채널의 활성화에 따라 글또 슬랙의 리텐션이 높아진다(당연하게도)\n    \n그래서 소모임 채널을 운영하기 위해 어떻게 해야하는지를 전달해보기\n소모임 채널의 주인분들을 4장님이라고 부르기로 했다\n글또라는 마을이 있고, 그 안에 소모임 사장님도 계셔서 마을을 조화롭게 꾸릴 수 있게 되는 것\n5년, 10년 후에 글또를 하신 분들이 그리워하시길 바라는 마음이 있다. 그런 생각이 들 수 있도록 해보기\n글또 11기에 질문이 종종 들어오지만, 지금은 크게 생각이 없다. 나 자신도 어떻게 해야할지 변화를 고민하는 시기고 글또를 지금 형태로 계속 유지하는 것이 어렵다고 생각되었다.\n    \n이후 커뮤니티가 어떻게 되는지는 OT 때 말했으니 나중에 다시 다뤄볼 예정\n마지막을 잘 정리하기 위해 국가가 어떻게 사라지는가, 생물이 어떻게 없어지는가 등을 찾아봤는데 참 잘 마무리하기 파트는 내용이 적다.\n마지막이라는 생각이 있기에 동기부여가 되기도 한다.\n    \n어떤 일을 “즐겁게” 하고 있는가?라는 생각을 종종 하는데 글또 운영이 요즘 즐겁다(하 이러면 안되는데) 포인트 시스템도 재미있고, 많은 분들이 활발히 활동해주셔서 그런 것 같다\n        \n그래도 일단 정리는 하는 것으로 생각하고 있고! 그래도 즐겁게 해보자\n그 이후는 끝나갈 쯤에 고민해도 늦지 않다. 지금은 지금이 중요하다\n\n글또 10기 참여자 관점\n오랜만에 글을 다시 작성한다. 최근에 글이 적었는데, 동기부여가 덜 되어서 글을 덜 작성했다.\n    \n연차가 쌓일수록 스스로에 대한 검열이 생기는데 이런 현상이였던 것 같다. 공부한 내용은 노션에 많은데 글로 작성한 것은 적다\n누군가를 위해서가 아닌 나를 위해서 하나씩 다시 기록하기로. 기록도 습관이라 계속 써야 그 관성이 유지된다\n인스타그램, 유튜브도 요즘 멈췄는데 이게 다 한번씩 겪는 그런 과정인 것 같다. 갑자기 무언가를 작성하고 공유하기까지 시간이 걸린다\n그럼에도 불구하고 하나씩 해야 쌓인다.\n글 작성한 것들이 지나고 나면 참 뿌듯하다. 멘토링을 하거나 기술적인 자문을 할 때 과거에 작성한 글이 도움되는 경우가 종종 있다. 하나의 글을 논리적으로 잘 접근해서 만들기\n글쓰기 세미나는 과거부터 총 5회 이상 진행했는데, 이젠 이 내용을 인프런에 글쓰기 강의로 올릴 예정. 인프런에 올리는 것이 빠를지 10기 글쓰기 세미나가 더 빠를지 모르겠지만, 일단 최대한 시도해보기\n\n어떤 글을 작성할 것인가?\n이번엔 데이터 엔지니어링 글, 나의 평소 생각(철학, 원칙)에 대한 글을 주로 작성 예정\n    \nDuckDB, Airbyte 등\n이런 도구들을 사용해서 스타트업에서 적당한 규모로 데이터 파이프라인 운영하기 글을 작성할 예정\n데이터 분석 과정에 대한 것도 정리해볼 것 같은데, 구체적인 케이스보다 전체적인 Overview를 나타내는 글 위주를 생각하고 있음\n그리고 지금 생각하고 있는 주제가 있는데, 이건 영상으로 풀지 글로 풀지도 고민. 둘 다 해도 괜찮을 것 같은데, 일단 만들고 고민할 예정\n요즘 보고 있는 논문도 있는데, 해당 내용도 정리할 예정\n개인 사업자의 삶 2년 회고도 가능할 것 같고, 어떤 부분이 더 개선되면 좋을지도 정리할 수 있음\n앞으로의 커리어에 대한 생각도 있는데, 이것은 조금 더 진행된 후에 글로 작성할 것 같다. 결정을 하고 시간이 지난 후 어떤지 판단할 수 있는 경우가 많기 때문\n타인에 의해 소재를 발굴하려고 하면 한계가 있다. 타인은 이야기를 하지 않는 경우가 많기 대문. 그래서 내 내면에서 내가 필요한 것을 고민하고, 요즘 처한 상황에서 문제를 해결하는 과정에서 소재를 뽑아내는 것이 중요.\n\n요즘 중요하게 생각하는 것은?\n아이유님 콘서트에 갔다가 과거의 내 꿈은 무엇이였고, 나는 지금 무엇을 하고 싶은지에 대해 생각해봤다\n이 질문은 살면서 계속 따라올 질문이라 답을 내려고 하는 것보단 주기적으로 생각하는 시기를 가지고 있다\n조금 더 내가 즐겁게 열심히 할 수 있는 환경도 마련해야 할 것. Comfort Zone을 조금은 벗어날 수 있는 시도를 할 것\n호명사회 책을 읽고 있는데, 요즘의 현실을 잘 반영한 책이라 생각한다. 내가 하고자 했던 것과 나의 원칙들을 잘 남겨두는 것이 중요하다\n원칙은 스스로 정리하고 있다. 이 부분은 더 쌓이면 블로그가 아닌 별도의 공간에 기록할 예정\n\n정리\n오랜만에 글또 다짐을 작성하니까 기분이 새롭다. 6개월 후엔 어떤 것들을 또 경험할지 기대된다\n작성한 내용을 최대한 지키려고 시도해보기. 주기적으로 이 내용을 보면서 내가 하려고 했던 바로 하고 있는지 생각해보기\n이런 기록이 쌓여서 나의 경험이 된다\n\n\n\n\n  \n글 작성하는데 걸린 시간 : 약 48분",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 창업가들에게 가끔 물어보는 질문이 있는데, “요새 잠을 잘 자지 못하게 하거나, 잠을 설치게 하는 고민들이 있다면 어떤 게 있나요?”이다. 영어로 하면 “What keeps you up at night?”인데 한국어로 번역하면 조금 어색하긴 하다. 내가 창업가들에게 항상 물어보는 게 아니라, 가끔 물어보는 이유는, 이 질문은 내가 첫 미팅이 아니라, 어느 정도 상대방을 안다고 생각할 정도로 만나 본 후에 물어보기 때문이다.\n얼마 전에 우리가 그동안 몇 개월 동안 대화를 하고 있던 우리의 잠재 투자자가 나한테 똑같은 질문을 했는데, 나는 이 질문을 그동안 창업가들에게 해 왔었지만, 정작 내 잠을 설치게 하는 것들에 대해서는 별로 생각을 해 본 적이 없어서 몇 분 생각을 했었다. 요샌 내가 밤에 잠을 못 잘 정도로 나를 힘들게 하거나 괴롭히는 것들은 없지만, 현재 내 가장 큰 고민거리는 지금 만들고 있는 새로운 펀드를 빨리 끝내는 것이다. 그런데 과거의 경험을 보면, 펀드를 하나 새로 만드는 건 힘들고 지루하고 시간이 걸리는 것이지 불가능한 건 아니라서, 이번 펀드도 그냥 시간이 걸릴 뿐이지, 결국엔 다 만들 것이라고 확신한다. 그래서 이건 실은 일시적인 고민이다.\n조금 더 장기적으로 봤을 때, 내가 끊임없이 고민하면서 밤잠을 설치는 걱정과 생각이 두 가지가 있다.\n첫 번째는, 우리가 계속 초기 투자를 하면서 스트롱이라는 브랜드가 어떻게 하면 처음과 끝이 항상 같게, 계속 의미 있는 존재로 남을 수 있을까인데, 이걸 다른 말로 표현하면 우리가 어떻게 하면 초기 투자자로서 계속해서 지금까지 유지하고 있는 영향력을 유지할 수 있을까이다. 실은 영어로 말하는 게 제일 정확한데, “how do we continue to stay relevant?”이다. 너무 세상이 빨리 바뀌다 보니, 우리도 외부 변화에 맞춰서 빠르게 적응해야 할 필요가 있다. 뻔한 말이지만, 결국 유일하게 변하지 않는 건 변화 그 자체이기 때문이다. 하지만, 이런 정신없는 변화 속에서도 우리가 항상 지켜야 할 원칙들이 있다. 이 또한 뻔한 말이지만, ‘원칙’이라는 말에 변하지 않는다는 의미가 포함되어 있다. 시대가 바뀌어도 몇 가지 변하지 않는 원칙, 그리고 그 원칙을 둘러싼, 계속 바뀌어야 하는 변수들, 이 것들을 제대로 구분해서, 원칙을 변수랑 착각하지 않으면서, 지금까지 우리를 존재하게 했던 것들을 계속 유지하는 고민. 이게 나를 잠 못 들게 하는 첫 번째 고민이다. 시장에서 의미와 영향력이 사라지면, 우리 같은 VC는 그냥 한 방에 훅 가는 것이라서 아주 심각한 고민이다.\n두 번째는, 갈수록 늘어나는 남에 대한 신경과 관심을 끄고, 어떻게 하면 남이 아닌 나 자신에게 모든 생각을 집중할 수 있을까이다. 한국은 장점이 너무 많은 나라인데, 단점 또한 많다. 아마도 한국 사회의 가장 큰 단점은 모두 다 남을 만족하기 위해서 살고 있다고 느낄 정도로 남의 목소리, 남의 의견, 남의 시선에 신경을 쓴다는 것이다. 이게 과해지면 본인의 목소리, 본인의 의견, 본인의 시선을 점점 잃어버리면서, 결국 내 인생을 불특정 다수의 남을 위해 살다가 죽게 되는데, 한국 사회가 이렇게 가고 있다는 느낌을 가끔 받는다. 틀린 결정을 하고 싶으면 다른 사람에게 의견을 물어보면 된다는 말도 있는데, 한국 사람들은 모두 다 이런 틀린 결정을 하고 싶어 하는 것 같다. 본인의 생각보단, 항상 남의 의견이 더 중요하니까. 나는 틀린 결정을 하더라도, 남이 결정해서 내가 틀리기보단, 그냥 내가 결정해서 내가 틀리는 걸 선호한다. 그래서 나는 웬만하면 남이 아닌 나에게 모든 걸 집중하고 싶은데, 한국에서 투자하면서 이걸 지킨다는 게 그렇게 쉬운 건 아니다. \n며칠 전에도 자기 전에 이 두 가지에 대해서 고민하다가 생각이 꼬리에 꼬리를 물면서 잠을 약간 설쳤는데, 그래도 나쁜 고민이라기보단 좋은 고민이고, 뭔가 정답이 있는 게 아니라 내가 계속 신경 써야 하는 좋은 점이라는 결론을 내리면서 생각의 꼬리를 잘라버리고 잠들었다.",

8px;}\n.css-1kxrhf3{white-space:pre-wrap;}요즘 많이 받는 질문이다. 부동산에서 입지가 중요하다는 것은 누구나 알고 있다. 그런데 최근에는 ‘얼죽신(얼어 죽어도 신축)’이라는 말이 생길 정도로 신축이 대세이다 보니 ‘입지는 좋은데 구축’과 ‘입지는 안 좋은데 신축’을 두고 고민하는 사람들이 부쩍 늘어났다.\n이 고민의 원인은 2가지다. 첫째는 물론 돈인데, 입지가 좋으면서 신축인 집은 너무 비싸기 때문에 우선순위를 따져야 하는 상황에 놓인다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}둘째는 ‘살아야 하는 집(실거주용)’과 ‘사야 하는 집(투자용)’ 중 어디에 중점을 둘지 결정하기 어려워서다. 실거주만 고려하면 고민 없이 현재 살기 편한 신축을 택할 텐데, 이왕이면 입지가 좋아서 향후 시세 차익을 기대할 수 있는 투자 가치도 포기하기는 어렵다. 두 마리 토끼를 모두 잡고 싶은데, 한정된 자금으로 한 마리만 잡아야 하는 상황 앞에서 고민이 깊어질 수밖에 없다.\n결국 선택은 자신의 몫이다. 오늘은 실거주와 투자 가치 둘 다 포기하지 못할 때 선택에 도움이 되어줄 예산, 입지, 신축과 구축을 둘러싼 관계를 살펴보자.\n땅값은 오르고 건물값은 떨어진다\n건물을 지을 수 있는 땅은 10년 정도 시간이 지나면 보통 가격이 두 배 정도 상승한다.(서울 기준) 필자의 사무실이 있는 서울 서대문구 명지대 근처의 경우 10년 전 주택가의 땅값은 평당 1,000~1,500만 원이었고, 2024년에는 위치가 안쪽이어도 평당 2,000만 원 이하는 없으며 건물을 지을 만한 땅은 2,500~3,000만 원에 시세가 형성되어 있다.\n인근에서 보다 상급지라고 할 수 있는 연희동의 경우도 마찬가지이다. 현재는 위치가 괜찮으면 평당 5,000~6,000만 원 이상을 웃돌고 있어 10년 전에 비해 두 배 이상 지가가 상승했다.\n물론 위치, 지형, 크기, 용도에 따라 다르지만, 부동산중개업에 종사하며 체감하기로도 상가, 빌라, 단독주택 등을 지을 수 있는 곳은 두 배 정도 땅값 상승이 흔하다. 특히, 위치가 좋을수록 그 상승폭은 더 크다.\n이와 반대로 건물값의 경우 시간이 갈수록 감가상각되어 0에 도달하게 된다. 건물의 상각률은 평균적으로 1년에 3% 내외라서, 보통 지어진 지 30년이 경과하면 건물값은 쳐주지 않는다. 즉, 이때부터는 땅값만 쳐주는 경향이 있다. 그러므로 건물이 신축일 때는 땅값과 건물값을 합쳐서 해당 부동산의 가격을 책정하지만, 30년 정도 지난 건물은 평당 얼마라는 식으로 ‘땅값×평수’로 해당 부동산의 가격이 책정되곤 한다.\n아파트도 마찬가지이다. 지어진 지 30년이 넘어가면 건물값은 거의 없다고 봐야 한다. 지금의 구축들도 신축 시절이 있었던 것처럼 신축도 몇년이 지나면 구축 취급을 받게 되며, 건물의 신축 프리미엄은 세월과 함께 눈 녹듯 사라져 땅값만 남는다. 사람마다 집을 구하는 용도, 계획, 성향에 따라 선택의 기준이 다른데, 장기적인 관점에서는 결국 입지의 중요성이 더 크게 부각된다는 점을 고려해야 한다. ‘입지가 안 좋은 신축’은 현재 가치가 높고 미래 가치가 낮고, ‘입지 좋은 구축’은 현재 가치가 낮은 대신 미래 가치가 높다고 할 수 있다. 시장에서 신축의 현재 가치는 시간이 지나면 낮아지지만, 입지의 미래 가치는 시간이 지날수록 상승한다. 부동산 전문가들은 대체로 현재의 만족감도 중요하지만 시간이 지날수록 점점 만족감이 커질 수 있는 것을 선택하는 쪽을 권하곤 한다.\n부동산을 통해 자산을 불리기로 결심했다면?\n부동산 시장을 예측하는 것은 매우 어렵고, 사자마자 하락을 경험할 수도 있다. 또 내 삶에서의 우선순위도 바뀌곤 하는데, 투자 가치를 따질 예정이라면 아래의 것들을 따져보고 불편을 감수할 필요가 있다.\n우선 단기적으로는 가격이 들쑥날쑥하지만 장기적으로 괜찮은 입지의 아파트의 경우 10년마다 두 배 이상 가격이 상승해왔다. 서울을 기준으로 상급지는 2.5~3배, 중급지는 ±2배, 하급지는 ±1.5배 정도 상승이 평균이다. 2024년 하반기 기준 서울 아파트의 급지는 매매가 20억 원 이상이면 상급지, 16~19억 원은 중상급지, 10~15억 원은 중급지, 5~9억 원은 하급지로 고려한다.\n참고로, 상급지일수록 신축 프리미엄이 오래가고, 급지가 내려갈수록 신축 프리미엄 기간이 짧다. 상급지는 지역 내에서 기존의 것을 헐어내고 새것을 공급하지 않는 한 대체재가 없는데, 급지가 내려갈수록 주변에 대체할 지역도, 새로 올라오는 건물도 얼마든지 있기 때문이다. 상급지에 대한 수요는 많고 공급이 한정되어 있어 벌어지는 현상이다. 물론 임대 가격도 같은 이유로 높게 형성된다.\n입지가 좋다는 평가를 받기 위해서는 감가상각되는 ‘건물의 하락분’을 땅의 ‘지가 상승분’으로 충분히 만회할 수 있어야 한다. 거꾸로 생각하면 입지가 좋을수록 건물의 감가상각보다 지가 상승 여력이 훨씬 크다. 그래서 부동산 거래를 많이 해볼수록 부동산을 매수할 때는 ‘해당 건물을 산다’라는 생각보다는 ‘해당 지역을 산다’라는 생각으로 접근하게 된다.\n지금 자신이 살고 있는 집의 10년 전 가격과 현재 가격을 비교해보자. 입지가 좋을수록 두 배 이상 상승했을 것이며, 입지가 좋지 않을수록 2배 이하로 상승했을 것이다. 그러고 나서 자신이 택한 부동산이 감가상각으로 인해 하락하는 건물의 가치를 토지의 지가 상승분이 채워주고 있는지를 따져본다. 즉, 보유하고 있는 부동산이 10년 동안 두 배 이상 가격이 상승되었는지 살펴본다. 충분히 채워주고 있지 못하다면 갈아타기를 서둘러야 할 것이며, 충분히 채워주고 있다고 하더라도 안주하지 말고 더 크게 채워줄 수 있는 곳이 있는지 찾아보고 임장을 다니는 등 다음 목표를 염두에 둘 것을 권한다.\n한 곳에 오랫동안 산 사람보다는 급지를 올려서 자주 이사 다니는 사람이 자산 증식 면에서 유리한 경우가 많다. 위에서 언급한 것처럼 급지별로 상승의 폭이 다르기 때문이다. 하급지일수록 이사 주기를 짧게 가져가야 하며, 상급지에 가까워질수록 이사 주기를 늘려도 된다. 변화를 시도해야 발전할 수 있는 기회도 많아진다.\n집을 지을 때도 입지에 따라 건축비가 결정된다\n최근 원자재값 상승과 인건비 상승으로 단기간에 건축비가 많이 올랐다. 이로 인해 우리가 흔히 빌라라고 부르는 다세대주택의 경우 중급 이상의 컨디션으로 신축하기 위해서는 평당 1,000만 원 정도의 비용이 들어간다.\n일반적으로 우리가 고려하는 동네에서 가장 많은 ‘제2종 일반주거지역’은 용적률이 200%이다. 땅 1평에 지을 수 있는 건물의 평수가 2평이라는 의미이다. 토지 가격이 평당 1억 원이라면 건물의 건축비를 평당 1,500만 원씩 써서 고급스럽게 지어도 3~4년 정도만 지나면 지가 상승분으로 건축비를 모두 회수할 수 있다. 평당 1억 원이던 땅이 3~4년 뒤에는 평당 1억 3,000~4,000만 원으로 상승해 있어 건축비 3,000만 원(2평×1,500만 원)이 회수될 가능성 높기 때문이다.\n이와 반대로 토지 가격이 평당 1,000만 원이라면 건물의 건축비를 평당 1,000만 원씩만 잡아도 지가 상승분으로 건축비를 모두 회수하기 위해서는 최소한 10년 이상이 걸린다는 계산이 나온다. 즉, 비싼 땅은 건축비를 많이 사용해도 지가 상승분으로 빠르게 건축비를 회수할 수 있지만 이와 반대로 싼 땅은 건축비를 적게 사용해도 회수까지의 시간이 오래 걸리는 것이다. 그래서 평당 토지 가격이 건축비보다 저렴한 땅에 신축을 계획한다면 무작정 고급스럽게 짓기보다는 최대한 가성비 있게 짓는 것에 비중을 둘 필요성이 있다.\n가끔 토지를 저렴하게 확보했으니 건축비는 넉넉하게 사용해도 된다는 생각을 갖고 있는 경우가 있는데, 부동산 투자 관점에서 좋은 건물은 토지 가격에 걸맞는 건축비를 사용한 것이다. 막연하게 ‘오랫동안 살 집'이라며 높은 건축비를 들이기보다는 회수까지 드는 시간을 확인하고 자금 계획을 세워야 한다. 지을 때는 로망으로 시작하지만, 대다수 건축하는 사람들의 목적은 예술보다 재테크로 귀결되곤 한다는 사실을 잊지 않았으면 한다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호",

(중략)\n\n\n제2회 한미일 경제대화(TED)에서 조태열 외교부 장관이 강조한 내용의 핵심은 ‘한미일 3국의 협력이 경제와 기업에 새로운 기회를 줄 수 있다'는 것입니다. 그는 세계 경제가 지정학적 문제와 안보·경제·기술이 모두 얽혀 있어서, 더 이상 \"안보는 안보, 경제는 경제\" 식으로 따로 생각할 수 없는 시대가 됐다고 지적했어요. 이런 상황 속에서 안정적인 공급망을 유지하는 것이 중요해진 것이죠.\n특히 올해 하반기와 내년 초에 일본과 미국에서 각각 새로운 정부가 출범될 예정이기에, 안정적인 공급망을 만들기 위한 ‘프렌드 쇼어링' 이 중요하다는 이야기가 또 한번 대두되었습니다. 한미일 3국이 서로 긴밀하게 투자하고 → 공급망을 구축하면 → 경제적으로 더 안정적이고 위기에도 잘 대응할 수 있는 관계를 만들 수 있다는 메시지였어요.\n실제로 현대자동차는 미래에 대처하기 위한 분주한 ‘에너지 동맹' 행보를 보이고 있습니다. 현대차그룹은 지난 7월 영국 옥스퍼드 대학과 함께 미래연구센터를 설립했는데요. 지정학적 불확실성에 대응하기 위한 시나리오를 마련하는 데에 특화된 기관을 탐색해오다 선택한 것으로 알려져 있습니다.\n러시아의 우크라이나 침공, 중동 정세의 불안 고조 등 전세계 지정학적 변화가 기업 경영에 미치는 영향의 폭과 강도가 그 어느 때보다 높은 지금, 한국 또한 미국/유럽/일본과 같이 정세 변화를 체크할 싱크탱크를 갖출 필요가 있기 때문이죠.\n프렌드 쇼어링 관계를 발전시키는 것이 중요한 이유는 ESG 관점에서도 살필 수 있는데요. 프렌드 쇼어링은 1) 지속 가능한 공급망 관리를 통해 사회적 책임을 증대하고, 2) 기업의 지배구조 투명성을 강화하는 데에 기여할 수 있습니다. 국가 간 경제 안보 협력을 통해 3) 장기적인 복원력을 높이는 데에도 큰 영향을 미치고요.\n.css-hokoge{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;counter-reset:numberedList;}.css-hokoge ul,.css-hokoge ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-hokoge>li{counter-increment:numberedList;margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-hokoge>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-hokoge>li>span{position:relative;}.css-hokoge>li>span>:first-child::before{content:counter(numberedList) '.';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n지속 가능한 공급망 관리: 기업들은 친환경적이고 지속 가능한 방식으로 공급망을 재편하고 있습니다. 애플은 작년에 생산 시설을 중국에서 인도로 일부 이전하면서, 중국 외의 신뢰할 수 있는 국가를 확장시키고 있어요. 이를 통해 원자재 조달과 생산 과정에서 생길 수 있는 환경적 부담을 줄이고, 정치적 위험 또한 최소화 하고자 합니다.\n기업의 지배구조 투명성 강화: 기업들은 프렌드 쇼어링을 통해 파트너 국가와의 신뢰를 바탕으로 투명성을 높일 수 있어요. 생산 과정과 원재료 사용의 투명성을 유지하면서도 장기적 관계를 구축할 수 있습니다. 이는 소비자와의 신뢰를 쌓는 데에도 중요한 역할을 해요.\n장기적 경제 복원력 높이기: 미국과 유럽은 반도체 같은 주요 산업 분야에서 프렌드 쇼어링을 통해 중국에 대한 의존도를 줄이고 있어요. 미국의 CHIPS Act(Chips and Science Act of 2022)와 유럽의 비슷한 몇몇 정책들은 주요 기술 제품의 국내 생산을 늘리고, 안정적인 공급망을 만드는 데에 기여하고 있습니다.\n\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n리쇼어링(reshoring): 해외로 이전했던 제조업이나 생산기지를 다시 자국으로 되돌리는 것. 기업들이 인건비나 세금 혜택을 고려해 해외로 공장을 이전하는 오프쇼어링(Offshoring)의 반대 개념이에요. 리쇼어링의 주요 목적은 공급망 안정성 확보, 국내 일자리 창출, 자국 경제 활성화 등입니다.\n니어쇼어링(nearshoring): 해외에 있던 제조업이나 생산기지를 자국으로 되돌리는 대신, 지리적으로 가까운 국가로 이전하는 것. 거리가 가까운 국가로 이전함으로써 비용 절감과 공급망 안정성을 동시에 꾀하는 전략을 말해요.\n지정학: 인문지리학의 원리를 적용하여 국제정치를 분석하는 학문 분야. 한 나라의 위치나 이웃 국가들과의 관계가 그 나라의 경제나 외교에 어떤 영향을 미치는지를 나타내는 개념을 말해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",

BD 팀(사업개발팀) 전원이 부산, 제주도 등 전국 방방곡곡 대리점 투어를 다니며 열과 성을 다해 토스플레이스의 제품을 설명했습니다. 그 결과 단말기 출시 후 3~4개월이 지나자 점차 입소문을 타며 판매에 속도가 붙기 시작했습니다. 특히 애플페이 결제 지원 기능과 토스 프론트를 키오스크로 전환해서 쓸 수 있는 기능, 토스 프론트의 첫 화면을 가게의 로고나 이벤트 정보로 설정할 수 있는 기능들이 붙으면서 경쟁력을 높여갔습니다.\n\n가게의 로고, 이벤트 정보 등으로 설정할 수 있는 토스 프론트의 첫 화면\n전국에 2~3천 개의 대리점이 있지만, 그 중 토스플레이스와 협력 중인 대리점은 400여 곳. 토스플레이스가 가파르게 성장하고 있지만, 아직 시장 점유율은 3.5%입니다. 문을 두드려야할 대리점도, 가맹점도 아주 많죠. 전국적인 서비스 공급자가 되려면 전국의 모든 대리점과 관계를 맺고 유통 해야 하기 때문에 토스플레이스는 특히 인력과 여건이 부족한 중·소규모 대리점과의 직접 소통을 강화하고, 대면 관계를 형성하는 데 많은 노력을 기울일 예정입니다.\n자영업 운영의 모든 것,\n사장님들의 ‘스위스 아미 나이프’를 꿈꾸며\n현재 토스플레이스는 강남구 일대에서 얼굴결제 비공개 베타 테스트를 진행 중입니다. 손님은 매끄러운 결제를 경험하고, 사장님은 고도화된 고객관리(CRM)로 지속적인 매출 성장을 기대할 수 있죠. 또한 앞으로 토스앱을 통해 매장 예약, 웨이팅, 비대면 주문 등의 기능들도 붙여나가며 토스앱, 그리고 사용자들과의 접점을 넓혀나갈 계획입니다.\n토스플레이스의 궁극적인 목표는, 사장님들이 본업에만 집중할 수 있도록 오프라인 자영업 운영에 필요한 모든 서비스를 제공하는 B2B 플랫폼이 되는 것입니다. 매출 관리부터, 고객 관리, 재고 관리, 세금 신고, 직원 채용까지. 매장 운영에 필요한 모든 기능이 한곳에 모인 ‘스위스 아미 나이프’ 같은 플랫폼을 꿈꾸며 오늘도 오프라인 결제 경험을 개선하고 있습니다.\n\n“자본과 기술의 결핍으로 디지털 세상에서 소외되는 사업자가 없도록, 모든 오프라인 자영업자의 삶과 매장운영을 궁극적으로 변화시켜 나가겠습니다\"\n- 최지은 토스플레이스 팀 리더\n\n잘나가는 사장님들이 토스 프론트를 쓰는 3가지 이유 \n토스플레이스의 이야기, 영상으로 보기 \n.css-oni540{position:relative;width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;}\n.css-122y91a{position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;}",
