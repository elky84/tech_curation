        "content:encodedSnippet": "C++ Language Updates in MSVC Build Tools v14.50\nIt has been some time since we have provided an update on MSVC progress, and this one comes with the latest major update to our IDE: Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0. This version of Visual Studio ships with the MSVC Build Tools version 14.50, which includes version 19.50 of the MSVC compiler. You can try out the improvements by downloading the Insiders release. Also, if you want to track updates in the Standard Library, check out the STL Changelog, which is regularly updated. Let’s jump right into the updates!\nC++23 Features\nAs C++ standards progress in MSVC, you can follow along using the cppreference compiler support table and help us identify what we should be working on next!\nP0849R8 (auto(x): decay-copy in the language)\n// Prior to P0849R8:\r\nvoid pop_front_alike(auto& x) {\r\n    using T = std::decay_t<decltype(x.front())>;\r\n    std::erase(x, T(x.front()));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// After P0849R8:\r\nvoid pop_front_alike(auto& x) {\r\n    std::erase(x, auto(x.front()));\r\n}\r\n\nP2437R1 Implement C++23 #warning\n// Valid prior to C++23.\r\n#error

There were no tool changes as of the date of the registry release in August, though more changes will be listed in the next release in September.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,666 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n14 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n240 ports were updated.

This allows GitHub users to receive automated PRs to upgrade their vcpkg versioning baselines. Since that announcement, the automated PRs have been updated to include information about the vcpkg release being upgraded to, including port counts per triplet, as well as a list of impacted ports and their original vs. new versions. Here is an example of one of the new PRs.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.08.27 release)\nNo tool updates as of 2025.08.27.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting with version 2025.2.1, CLion now supports Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, thanks to an integration that is currently in Beta.\nDevelopers working on embedded systems, projects written in C or C++, or performance-critical software can now experience the full benefit of Junie’s project insights and tooling, directly in CLion. With Junie, you get the structure and visibility you’ve been missing. No more grepping through build logs or reverse-engineering target configs – Junie does it all.\nLet’s take a look at what makes this integration so powerful and why it’s great news for C and C++ developers.\nTRY JUNIE IN CLION\nThe power of Junie in CLion\nJunie, the AI coding agent created by JetBrains, gives developers deep visibility into projects and helps supercharge their development workflows, right inside the IDE. It was built to address their specific needs, independently completing tasks like testing code, fixing bugs, bootstrapping and prototyping, searching inside projects, writing behavioral specifications and documentation, describing execution paths, and more! By bringing Junie into CLion, we’re providing a unified experience. Now, you get all the benefits of Junie without ever leaving your IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with Junie in CLion\nGet answers\nYou can put Junie in Ask mode, and it will then answer any questions you give it about modules, directories, execution paths, project setup and configuration, and other complex topics. To fully understand the context of your project, Junie uses many of the tools available in the IDE, such as Search Everywhere, the file structure, code analysis, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAsking about a method’s functionality\nAsk mode is designed for question-and-answer tasks. If you want Junie to change code or create files, use Code mode.\nGenerate README\nJunie can help you understand your codebase and project structure, and it can even generate README files for this purpose. Below is an example of generating a README file for one of the demo projects shipped with the Bullet Physics SDK:\n\n                        \n\n\nGenerating a README for a C++ project\nUse Code mode to generate tests\nIn Code mode, you can have Junie create tests that use frameworks such as GoogleTest, Catch2, or CppUnit.\n\n                        \n\n\nCreating a Google test\nJunie will even run the tests for you, and when a test is done, you will receive a report detailing all the files Junie modified or created:\n\n\n\n\nJunie’s report about the test results\nIf you’re not satisfied with the test implementation, you can undo the changes by clicking the Rollback button in the Junie tool window.\nReview your code and fix bugs\nYou can ask Junie to review your code changes to ensure they are correct before you commit them. Junie will examine different aspects of your changes, including behavior and compatibility, code quality, and style. Junie will also share recommendations for improvements.\n\n                        \n\n\nReviewing code changes\nIn Code mode, Junie can fix any bugs it finds and immediately test the solution. After updating files, Junie provides links that allow you to view the code changes in the Diff Viewer. You can then accept or reject the results.\nGive Junie more autonomy\nIn Code mode, Junie requires your approval to make potentially sensitive changes, execute terminal commands, and perform other actions. However, if you trust Junie and don’t want to spend effort on micromanaging its decisions, you can enable Brave mode in the task window. This mode will allow Junie to execute all actions without your approval.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Brave mode\nBrave mode can save you time and is helpful, for example, when you need to execute certain routine tasks regularly.\nImplement guidelines\nYou can document testing scripts, third-party tool usage, and development guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md at the project root. Junie will then follow these guidelines while working on every task. You can either add the file manually or ask Junie to generate it for you.\nCurrent limitations\nJunie doesn’t yet work well with remote or WSL toolchains. The Beta release of this Junie integration mainly focuses on CMake projects, so you may need to manually reload the project model for other project types. We’ll notify you as soon as these issues are addressed.\nStart using Junie in CLion today \nGetting Junie set up in CLion is simple. There are three main options to make it happen: \nInstallation from the JetBrains AI widget﻿\nInstallation from the in-IDE Marketplace﻿ tab\nInstallation from disk\nFor more details to help you choose the installation option that best fits your needs, take a look at our general guidelines, and if you have any additional questions, check out the documentation.\nWe value your feedback! If you have anything to share or if you run into any problems, please let us know through our issue tracker.",

You can now provide icons using factory methods, and the platform has been updated with a range of enhancements.\nDOWNLOAD MPS 2025.2\nImportant notice: Update the MPS merge driver\nWe’ve changed the logic in the MPS merge driver, which detects the persistence approach used for individual files, and we’ve also dropped a few old persistence hacks. It is important to allow MPS to update the merge driver when it detects that an older version is specified in your projects.\n\nWhat’s new\nCheck out all the updates available in the latest release.\nBinary launchers for Windows and Linux\nMPS now includes native binary launchers for Windows and Linux. These launchers provide a more robust and convenient way to start MPS than the script-based launchers, for example, by allowing you to pin the application to the taskbar and to the start menu.\ncreate updated build scripts, so you don’t need to take any additional action when working on a new project.\nAdding binary launchers and product-info.json to existing build scripts\nIf you’re updating an older MPS-based distribution to include the new binary launchers, please follow the steps mentioned in the documentation.\n\nFactory method icons\nIn addition to the existing TextIcon, FileIcon, and ConstantFieldIcon concepts, a new FactoryMethodIcon concept is now available. It allows an icon to be specified by reference to a concrete static factory method declaration that creates and returns an instance of javax.swing.Icon.\n\nResolve-info updated during copy-paste\nResolve-info is now correctly updated when copying references to the clipboard. When you rename the target of a reference, such as a variable, without using the Rename refactoring, the resolve-info of references pointing to that target will not be updated. However, as soon as you copy such references to the clipboard, their resolve-info gets updated correctly, and the references will be correctly re-resolved when pasted.\nRaising the bar to Java 21\nMPS is keeping pace with the evolving Java ecosystem. In this release, we’ve updated both the source and target compatibility to Java 21, unlocking access to new language features and improved runtime performance.\nMore new features…\nCheck out the What’s New page to learn all about the new features.\nhere.\nGive all the new features a try, and let us know what you think.\nYour JetBrains MPS team",

        "pubDate": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 12:26:47 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "You have probably seen this picture occasionally and wondered what is happening with your IDE and why it freezes! This is a tricky question, and many types of bugs and performance issues may lead to UI freezes.\nJetBrains IDEs are built on top of a UI framework (the Java AWT) that uses a single thread, the event dispatch thread (EDT), to perform painting operations and process user input events.\nA UI freeze occurs when the IDE cannot execute operations on the EDT, preventing interaction with the IDE. This blog tries to consolidate our knowledge about freezing reasons and causes. Use it to investigate and resolve UI freezes in your IDE plugins!\nThe IntelliJ Platform’s UI architecture\nBecause our UI frameworks are built on top of a single thread, it is important to keep the EDT from remaining blocked for a long time. The EDT runs an event loop that processes AWT events. Typical examples of these events are user input (such as typing or moving the mouse) and repaint requests from Swing.\nEvents need to be processed within 16 ms. Otherwise, the IDE is not able to render 60 frames per second.\nInvestigating UI freezes\nIn the vast majority of cases, simply looking at the thread dump will give you the information you need about a UI freeze. The investigation should start with the thread AWT-EventQueue-N – this is the EDT. Normally, its name should be AWT-EventQueue-0. If you see a bigger number in the suffix, there might be a platform issue.\nIn the event of a UI freeze, the EDT is usually blocked on some kind of lock.\nFreezes caused by the read-write lock\nIf you are unfamiliar with the concept of the IntelliJ Platform’s read-write lock, you can learn more about it from this notebook.\nDue to the IntelliJ Platform’s architecture, the write lock is often acquired on the EDT. Since it often isn’t possible to acquire the write lock immediately, you will sometimes see the following lines in the stack trace of the EDT:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer@3a946cba\nat java.base@21.0.8/java.lang.Object.wait0(Native Method)\n...\n(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.upgradeWritePermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:370)\n...\nat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:921)\n...\nat com.intellij.ide.IdeEventQueue.dispatchEvent(IdeEventQueue.kt:347)\n...\nat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThe key line here is marked with (!). This line indicates that the EDT is blocked on the acquisition of the write lock. In this case, there is no need to look above. The IntelliJ Platform usually enters emergency mode if it detects a UI freeze and runs some of its internal procedures.\nThe EDT being blocked on the write lock is a sign that a thread is running under the read lock. The next step in our investigation is to find this background thread. This can be done by searching for a substring readAction (case-insensitive) in the thread dump.\nFor example, we may find the following thread:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 1/11\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 runnable\n     java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.QuantifierNounCompatibility.<clinit>(QuantifierNounCompatibility.java:38)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.AgreementSet.<clinit>(AgreementSet.java:42)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.PluralsInCompounds.<clinit>(PluralsInCompounds.java:21)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.Articles.<clinit>(Articles.java:250)\n\t...\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.toolkit.LanguageToolkit.allParameters(LanguageToolkit.java:87)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.grazie.pro.TreeRuleChecker.calcParameters(TreeRuleChecker.java:234)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.codeInsight.daemon.impl.AnnotatorRunner$$Lambda/0x00000070047e8000.run(Unknown Source)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.tryRunReadAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:826)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nThis thread is taken from ForkJoinPool, and we see that it is currently running a read action (at (!)). We also see AnnotatorRunner in the stack trace, which means that this thread is currently running highlighting. The read actions in highlighting are canceled on a pending write action, which means that the UI freeze is caused by the code not checking for ProgressManager.checkCanceled. In the middle of the block, we see some traces from the Grazie plugin (starting from (!!)). This concludes our investigation. We’ve found the problem – Grazie does not check for checkCanceled frequently enough, which causes the UI to freeze.\nFreezes caused by a background write action\nThe IntelliJ Platform gradually moves write actions to background threads, but this functionality is currently unstable, and it can cause additional UI freezes and deadlocks.\nWhile a write action can run in the background, the EDT still often acquires a write-intent lock, resulting in stack traces like the following:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #91 [119043] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=71985.87ms elapsed=1065.05s tid=0x00000001610c4c00 nid=119043 sleeping [0x0000000398429000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.sleep0(java.base@21.0.8/Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.acquireWriteIntentPermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:416)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThis means that the EDT cannot immediately acquire a write-intent lock. Our next step is to search for a write action. In this case, it may appear in coroutine dumps. For example:\n- \"RefreshQueue pool\":StandaloneCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5, Rete(abortOnError=false, commands=capacity=2147483647,data=[onReceive], reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516, dbSource=ReteDbSource(reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516)), DbSourceContextElement(kernel Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5), ComponentManager(ApplicationImpl@106897812), com.intellij.codeWithMe.ClientIdContextElementPrecursor, Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)]\n\tat com.intellij.core.rwmutex.WriteIntentPermitImpl.acquireWriteActionPermit(RWMutexIdea.kt:263)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl.processEventsSuspending(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:191)\n  ...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl$queueAsyncSessionWithCoroutines$3$1.invokeSuspend(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:177)\nHere we see that a coroutine is SUSPENDED on acquisition of the write lock. In particular, VFS refresh cannot proceed, which means that a read action is alive. Indeed:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 7/9\" #201 [175107] daemon prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=153605.15ms elapsed=1039.57s tid=0x0000000142955a00 nid=175107 runnable  [0x00000003610e7000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\tat com.intellij.psi.impl.file.impl.MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.get(MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.kt:67)\n\t...\n\tat org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeInsight.lineMarkers.KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.collectSlowLineMarkers(KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.kt:35)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(java.base@21.0.8/ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nHere we again arrive at the conclusion that some code cannot be canceled due to the read action.

It indicates that the IntelliJ Platform is in emergency mode, where it is still able to run certain trusted AWT events or draw a freeze popup UI.\nIt is very rarely a cause of a freeze, so the problem is likely somewhere else.\nFreezes caused by thread starvation\nThe IntelliJ Platform uses the Kotlin Coroutines library a lot. In coroutines, there are two major thread pools: Dispatchers.Default and Dispatchers.IO. Both are bounded, with Dispatchers.Default containing as many threads as there are cores in your machine and Dispatchers.IO containing 64 threads. If all these threads are blocked on some operation, then the IDE encounters thread starvation – a situation where coroutine machinery cannot progress because all threads in a thread pool are blocked.\nThe usual symptom of thread starvation is coroutines being stuck in the Cancelling state. They cannot move into Cancelled because they cannot execute cleanup actions on their respective thread pools.\nTo investigate thread starvation of the Default dispatcher, you need to find all blocked threads that contain runDefaultDispatcherTask.\nFor example:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-9@28483\" daemon prio=5 tid=0xa0 nid=NA waiting\n  java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Unsafe.java:-1)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:269)\n\t...\n\t\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Builders.kt:48)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Unknown Source:1)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.platform.pluginManager.frontend.BackendUiPluginManagerController.awaitForResult(BackendUiPluginManagerController.kt:293)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler.runSafely(CoroutineScheduler.kt:610)\n\t(!) at kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runDefaultDispatcherTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:882)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.executeTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:906)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runWorker(CoroutineScheduler.kt:775)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:762)\nIf there are as many such threads as cores in your machine (at (!)), then you have signs of thread starvation. Similarly, if you’re dealing with thread starvation of the IO dispatcher, you’ll have 64 blocked threads named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N.\nNB: It is not enough to look at all threads that are named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N to conclude that there is thread starvation of the Default dispatcher. The coroutine scheduler shares physical threads between the Default and IO dispatchers, so it is difficult to say which thread belongs to which dispatcher without actually looking at the source code.\nTo fix thread starvation, blocking operations need to be moved out of the Default dispatcher. Here we see that runBlocking is used in the line with (!!), and it needs to be moved to a different dispatcher.\nFreezes caused by service initialization\nAnother frequent source of locks in the IntelliJ Platform is service initialization. Since services are initialized once, a thread that tries to access a service can block while waiting for initialization on another thread.\nHere’s an example of this scenario:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #59 [128003] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=3011.23ms elapsed=172.40s tid=0x000000012c07ae00 nid=128003 waiting on condition  [0x000000039b0ae000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImplKt.runBlockingInitialization$lambda$9(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:1660)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImpl.getService(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:672)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebuggerManager.getInstance(XDebuggerManager.java:32)\n\t...\n\t(!!!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:939)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nWe see that the EDT is blocked on the initialization of a service in the line marked (!). The service is XDebuggerManager (at (!!)), so there might be something wrong inside it. Additionally, we note that this process is running under the write action (at (!!!)), an observation that will be useful later.\nBy searching for XDebuggerManager, we can find the following thread:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-4\" #55 [130051] daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=1537.10ms elapsed=172.41s tid=0x000000012b883c00 nid=130051 in Object.wait()  [0x000000036b607000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (on object monitor)\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait0(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.runReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1028)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.breakpoints.XBreakpointManagerImpl.loadState(XBreakpointManagerImpl.java:536)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:388)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:81)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.configurationStore.ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.initComponentBlocking(ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.kt:43)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:765)\nThe service instance initialization at (!!) tries to acquire the read lock (at (!)). The problem is clear – the write action on the EDT is blocked on the lock in service init, and service init is blocked on the read lock acquisition. This is a deadlock because of the incorrect order of the two locks.\nThe best way to fix it is to move the read action out of service initialization. If this is not possible, you can preload the service in the read action. This way, service initialization will inherit read access.\nHow to deal with runBlocking\nSometimes, you may notice that a thread is blocked in runBlocking. This means that it is trying to execute coroutines synchronously.\nFor example:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 6/15\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on kotlinx.coroutines.BlockingCoroutine@41813fd4\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$BuildersKt__BuildersKt(Builders.kt:85)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.progress.CoroutinesKt.runBlockingCancellable(coroutines.kt:117)\n\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner.run(CheckerRunner.kt:53)\n\t...\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nFirst, we need to make sure that runBlockingCancellable is present (at (!)). This is a special platform version of runBlocking that works well with our cancellation machinery.\nSince this thread runs the read action (at (!!)), we now need to figure out why it cannot be canceled. To do this, we need to look in the coroutine dump and search for the coroutine tree starting with BlockingCoroutine (this is the name of the coroutine corresponding to runBlocking). Here’s what we find:\n- JobImpl{Active}\n\t- BlockingCoroutine{Active}@41813fd4, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:69)\n\t\t- DeferredCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.SentenceBatcher$forSentences$1.parseAsync(SentenceBatcher.kt:96)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.CloudOrLocalBatchParser.parseAsync(CloudOrLocalBatchParser.kt:20)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.ParsedSentence$Companion.getSentences(ParsedSentence.kt:104)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker.checkExternally$suspendImpl(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:18)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker$Style.checkExternally(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:48)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1$deferred$1$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:56)\nWe see that this coroutine runs at com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner, which means that this BlockingCoroutine corresponds to runBlocking in the above trace. Now we can inspect the coroutine tree and try to find out the cause of the freeze.\nSince the state of the coroutine is DeferredCoroutine{Active}, it is not canceled. This means something is wrong with cancellation in the platform, as the platform should cancel all read actions on an incoming write action; hence, all coroutines should also be canceled. Normally, we should see BlockingCoroutine{Cancelling} here. \nTo fix this UI freeze, we need to figure out why the coroutine cannot transition to the {Cancelled} state. Most likely, the code does not call ProgressManager.checkCanceled() frequently enough.\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we explored common sources of UI freezes in IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform. Most often, the freezes are caused by insufficient cooperation between plugin code and the IntelliJ Platform. By using the IntelliJ Platform’s primitives for executing cancellable operations, we can greatly improve the responsiveness of JetBrains IDEs.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Note: This is a guest post from John Arundel, a Go writer and teacher who blogs at bitfieldconsulting.com. His most recent book is The Deeper Love of Go.\nHow do you break it to someone that they’ve wasted most of their life? Well, I worked with a guy who didn’t know how to copy and paste. Every time he wanted to move some code, he’d delete it and then grimly re-type the whole thing somewhere else, as I watched in silent dismay: “How do I tell him?”\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t want to be able to copy and paste. He just had no idea that he could – he’d never taken the time to fiddle around and find out.\nThat guy is all of us, in a way. Even if we can copy and paste, what other editor superpowers are we missing out on? And how much time are we wasting by not knowing about them? I’m just going to confidently say “Some”, right?\nA modern IDE is more than just a text editor – it’s also a file manager, debugger, linter, AI assistant, and so on. Even better, an IDE like GoLand actually understands Go, so it can make suggestions as you type, highlight errors, annotate your code, and refactor automatically.\nHere are ten things you might not know GoLand can do, and each one will make you more productive as a Go developer.\nSearch everywhere\n90% of software engineering is just finding stuff, I reckon: where is that function defined? Where did I put that struct type?\nDouble-tap the Shift key in GoLand and type to search everywhere”: definitions, symbols, filenames, or even editor features. For example, enter search to see all search-related settings.\n\n\n\n\nGo to implementation\nCmd-click a function or variable name and GoLand will take you straight to its definition, even in another package or file (or even the standard library or your dependencies). And you can keep drilling down further until you find what you need, then use Cmd-[ to jump back.\n\n\n\n\nStructure view\nFor a high-level overview of your constants, functions, types, and their associated methods, press Cmd-F12 to open the Structure view of your file or package. Click on any item to go to its definition.\n\n\n\n\nParameter names\nGoLand shows inline hints for function calls, giving parameter names for each function argument. This makes reading code easier, especially when arguments are nil, for example. You’ll also see name hints for results in a return statement, and field names for struct literals that omit them.\n\n\n\n\nErrors and warnings\nSure, GoLand can point out compile errors – an angry red underline indicates the offending code, and you can hover the mouse over it to see what’s wrong (or use the Inspection Lens plugin to see all errors inline without hovering). Saved you a compile-edit-fix cycle.\nThat’s great, but GoLand will also warn you about probable mistakes: unreachable code, unhandled errors, unused functions, redundant type conversions, or variable names that shadow the name of a package. Even though they’re technically legal (the best kind of legal), they’re likely not what you meant, and GoLand will pick these up and offer to auto-fix them.\n\n\n\n\nNil pointer analysis\nAh, pointers! The cause of – and solution to – all programming problems. Specifically, pointers can be nil (meaning “doesn’t point to any value”). That’s a problem if you try to dereference such a pointer (that is, ask Go to give you the value it points to), and by “problem” I mean “horrible crash”.\nBut how can you tell whether a pointer will be nil at run time without running the program? Only by understanding the complete history of that variable throughout the code. Unfortunately, even GoLand isn’t yet smart enough to *touches earpiece* and I’m being told that in fact GoLand is now smart enough to do that.\nThe experimental data flow analysis feature simulates the execution of your program to catch run-time errors like nil pointers even before you run it. That’s something I’ve never seen before in an IDE, and it’s pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nCompletions and templates\nYou’d expect GoLand to offer inline completions of function and variable names and so on, but that’s table stakes. Even more powerful are live templates: parameterized code snippets you can insert and complete interactively.\nFor example, if you want to write a for ... range loop, type for, and select For range loop from the picklist (or type forr and press Tab). You’ll get a skeleton for loop with placeholders for you to fill in the loop variables and body.\nSimilarly, if you get bored typing if err != nil... repeatedly (but how could anyone find that boring?) GoLand can fill in the error-handling block for you, if you ask nicely.\nLive templates automate dozens of the most common Go patterns and idioms, and you can create your own, with placeholders like $INDEX$ for parameters you want users to fill in.\nAlso, if you have a blob of JSON data that you need to turn into a Go type, just paste it into the editor. GoLand will offer to generate the struct definition for you automatically, complete with json tags to make it parseable.\n\n\n\n\nRefactoring\nDo you ever wish you’d named your child something different? It might be a bit late to revisit that one, but fortunately it’s always possible to rename things in your Go programs, like functions and variables.\nManually retyping them everywhere would be annoying, and normal search-and-replace is error-prone (the Scunthorpe problem). GoLand is smarter about this because it understands Go: it knows if a word is a variable or function name, and avoids replacing it if it’s in some other context like inside a string or a comment.\nAlso, you can edit a function’s signature, adding or removing parameters as you like, and GoLand will automatically change the calls to that function everywhere.\nOr try this one weird tip to slim down your chubby functions, and make your code beach body ready: select some lines and use Extract method to replace them with a call to a method that does the same thing. By eliminating paperwork, you make the program more readable and focus on what’s actually relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nNow, I’m not saying you ever write bugs – perish the thought. Shall we say rather that programs occasionally don’t behave exactly the way we expect them to? Figuring out just where and why things are going wrong can be difficult, unless you can shrink down to the size of an electron and go inside the computer to see what’s happening (I’m still waiting on that Kickstarter).\nFailing this, though, GoLand’s debugger is a pretty acceptable substitute. For example, set a breakpoint on a suspicious line and the debugger will stop the program there, keeping all variables intact so that you can inspect them (or edit them). Breakpoints can be conditional, too, so you only stop if a certain expression is true.\nThen, if the problem still isn’t clear, you can Step Over to continue executing the code line by line, or Step Into to follow function calls down the rabbit hole.\nTo get really inside baseball, you can set a watch on the variables you’re interested in, or even arbitrary Go expressions, and see their values change as the program runs.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains AI tools\nYou were expecting this, right? Everything has AI now (or as I like to say, “Everything’s computer”). GoLand’s optional AI Assistant plugin is there, not to supplant your wonderfully human intelligence, but to support it.\nFor example, you can highlight some code and ask the assistant to explain it,  suggest refactorings, or generate tests. You can ask it questions about the language or the standard library – all those “at this point I’m afraid to ask” things, and it won’t judge you.\nNaturally, you can also use Junie, the JetBrains AI coding agent, as part of GoLand. You can ask Junie to write whole packages or programs for you, or to read a bunch of user requirements and sketch out a system design, then implement it.\nIf there’s some project you’ve always wanted to write, but you aren’t sure how to get started, collaborating with Junie could get you unblocked. Think of Junie as a pair programmer who doesn’t get bored or lose focus, and who can help you out with program structure and algorithms while still letting you have the fun of writing the interesting parts yourself.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more\nWhat’s that? Ten superpowers aren’t enough for you? You’ve got some attitude, mister. Look, GoLand can do more than we’ve had time to cover here – a lot more. But these ten things are a great place to start. Once you’ve mastered them, feel free to explore: read the docs, click around, try stuff out.\nDon’t be like my non-copy-pasting friend, always too busy cutting wood to stop and sharpen the saw. A few minutes a day invested in really learning your IDE is time well spent. Pretty soon, these superpowers will become part of your muscle memory, just like copy and paste. (GoLand has that too. You’re welcome.)",

On the MCP Settings page, you can see the list of connected servers and add or edit JSON configurations for the MCP servers in the ~/.junie/mcp.json file.\n\nTo configure an MCP server at the project level, manually add an mcp.json file with your desired server configurations to the .junie/mcp folder in the project root.\nTo view the list of actions that Junie can perform through a configured MCP server, locate the server in the MCP Settings list and expand the Status drop-down.\n\nFor example, with the Laravel Boost MCP server, Junie gets useful tools for working with Laravel projects, such as listing Artisan commands, routes, or config files, reading logs, querying databases, or searching versioned documentation.\nThis is where the MCP shines: It bridges the gap between LLMs and dynamic, framework- and project-specific context and data.\n\n\n\n\nBenefit from improved context when using Junie. \nWhen running a prompt, Junie analyzes what commands registered with the configured MCP servers are relevant and executes them through the respective MCP server.\n\nThe Junie coding agent keeps evolving. Join the conversation in our Junie Discord community and help shape what’s next for Junie.\nA new chapter for MCP servers in PHP\nThe official MCP PHP SDK is more than just another SDK for creating MCP servers. Rather, it marks a significant contribution of the PHP community to the AI ecosystem, boosting PHP’s role as a language for creating AI tools. \nThe MCP PHP SDK maintainers encourage PHP developers to submit their MCP integrations for PHP frameworks and tools – Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, custom APIs, and more – to be listed in the SDK’s GitHub repo.",

We’ve also got a featured section by Marit van Dijk, covering the new Java 25 release, the latest IntelliJ IDEA updates, and a playful take on learning modern Java.\nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nMarit van Dijk\nMarit van Dijk is a software developer, Java Champion and Developer Advocate at JetBrains. She has over 20 years of diverse experience across various roles and companies, and is passionate about building awesome software in collaboration with amazing people, and making developers’ lives better. She is a frequent speaker at international conferences, writes blog posts and tutorials, creates videos, and is a contributor to the book “97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know” (O’Reilly Media).\nWelcome to Java Annotated Monthly for September. For the folks in Europe / the Northern hemisphere, I hope that you have had a great summer and were able to disconnect from work.\nThis month, I’m excited for the start of the conference season with my first talk at JavaZone and, of course, the release of Java 25 on September 16, 2025. This release comes with some nice changes to the language: Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods and Module Import Declarations make it easier to get started with Java, Flexible Constructor Bodies allow statements in a constructor before calling super(), so you can validate your data before constructing objects, and Scoped Values make managing thread-local data more convenient, safe, and scalable. This feature will be even more useful with Structured Concurrency (still in preview). In addition, there are improvements in performance and performance insights, as well as several other changes. We will write a blog post with more details later this month.\nJava 25 support was introduced in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2, with additional support added in 2025.2.1. IntelliJ IDEA already introduced support for Java 25 in 2025.2, and additional support was added in 2025.2.1. In case you missed it, check out the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 stream, where we show you Java 25 support, Virtual Threads Debugger, Spring Debugger and Spring Modulith support, support for Maven 4 (which may also be released soon), and a sneak peek of a new feature we are working on!\nJava 25 will be an “LTS” version. Or is it? If you are updating from Java 21, watch this great video by Nikolai Parlog on How to Upgrade to Java 25, showing you some of the problems you might encounter when upgrading and how to solve them, the overview of All New Java Language Features Since Java 21 by José Paumard, and other videos in the series.\nIn Learning Modern Java the Playful Way, fellow Java Champion Piotr Przybył and I show you how to upgrade your code using live demos (and silly jokes). You can catch a slightly updated version of this talk at several conferences this Fall/Autumn. To find out where I’ll be, check my website.

        "title": "5 Ways Static Code Analysis Can Improve Developer Experience",
        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/qodana/2025/09/improve-developer-experience/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:28:03 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Improve developer experience with static code analysis. \n\n\n\nDeveloper experience is not only about nice editors and fast build times. It is about reducing friction so developers can focus on solving problems rather than fighting with tools. Among the most effective developer experience tools available today is static code analysis. By examining code without running it, static analysis surfaces potential issues early and helps teams deliver higher-quality software, faster.\nResearch from Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey showed that “Public search engines are the top resource used by professional developers to find answers to technical questions. 55% use traditional search and 15% use AI-powered search, either free or paid”. But what if the tools we work in to improve code quality and security to help provide those answers with in-context learning? \nThis is just one of the ways that static code analysis can significantly improve developer experience.  The same research found that developers had high levels of frustration with technical debt, tech stack complexity and the reliability of the tools they use – all of which we’ve taken into account when developing Qodana’s roadmap.  \n\n\n\n\nThis research, as well as anecdotal sharing and common research findings, shows that developers have a lot of frustration in their daily workflows, so how else can static code analysis help? Today, we’re highlighting 5 ways: \n1. Faster feedback loops\nWaiting for a build to complete or a test suite to run slows momentum. Static code analysis integrates directly into the development environment or CI pipeline, providing almost immediate insights into potential bugs, style violations, or security vulnerabilities. \nInstead of context switching between writing code and waiting for feedback, developers can fix problems as they code. Faster feedback loops shorten the distance between writing and validating, which keeps developers in the flow.\n2. Reduced cognitive load\nModern systems are complex, and keeping all the rules, patterns, and security practices in mind while coding is unrealistic. Static code analysis acts as a safety net, catching violations of coding standards, identifying unsafe constructs, and reminding developers of best practices. \nThis reduces the mental overhead of remembering every guideline and allows developers to concentrate on design and problem solving. Over time, this makes coding less stressful and improves overall team productivity.\n3. Improved code quality and consistency\nTeams often struggle with inconsistent coding styles or subtle bugs that slip into production. Static code analysis enforces coding standards across the project, ensuring consistency and readability. \nIt can detect common error patterns like null pointer dereferences, uninitialized variables, or unused imports before they cause real issues. By automatically highlighting these concerns, static analysis tools improve the reliability of the codebase and build long term maintainability.\n4. Time savings across the lifecycle\nFixing a defect after release is many times more expensive than resolving it during development. Static code analysis catches problems at the earliest stage, reducing the need for long QA cycles or emergency hotfixes – and Qodana has quick fixes. \nIt also helps reviewers by pre-filtering trivial issues, so code reviews can focus on architecture and logic instead of formatting or lint-level concerns. Developers spend less time on rework and more time on meaningful progress.\nIn some cases, like with Qodana, capability extends beyond simple analysis with checks for security vulnerabilities, license incompatibilities and malicious injections. These massively contribute to compliance issues and time spent when they aren’t detected out the gate, so detection saves time and legal issues. \n5. Integration with modern developer experience tools\nStatic code analysis is most effective when combined with other developer experience tools. For example, integrating analysis with CI/CD pipelines creates automated quality gates that block unsafe or noncompliant code before it reaches production. \nConnecting with IDEs provides inline feedback during coding sessions. Qodana can even align findings with compliance standards, making it easier for enterprises to ensure both quality and security.\n\n\n\n\nStatic code analysis is more than a safety net to catch errors. It can genuinely improve developer experience. By offering faster feedback, reducing cognitive load, improving code quality, saving time, and integrating with the wider developer toolchain, it helps teams deliver better software with less friction. \nFor organizations that want to support their developers, adopting static code analysis is an essential step toward a healthier and more productive workflow.\nContribute to better developer experiences in your organization\nIf you want to improve developer experience and remove obstacles, you can support the teams in your organization with a reliable code quality and security tool. \nTry Qodana",

Here’s a teaser of some of the things you can find in this new version:\nAI Integrated Development\nAI in Visual Studio 2026 isn’t bolted on. It’s woven into the daily rhythms of coding. Think of it as a quiet partner that knows your solution, respects your muscle memory, and offers help that’s timely rather than intrusive.\nYou’ll notice it when you drop into a new codebase and the IDE helps you understand what you’re looking at, suggests the kinds of tests that usually get written in your repo, and keeps your docs and comments in step with your code. You’ll feel it when a “paste and fix” moment becomes a single confirmation because the editor adapts the snippet to your project’s patterns and conventions. And when performance questions pop up, you won’t be guessing – guidance is grounded in real traces and validated with benchmarks, so fixes come with confidence, not hope.\nCode reviews start with clear, actionable insights about correctness, performance, and security – on your machine, before you ever open a pull request. Through it all, you stay in control. The IDE takes the busy-work; you keep the judgment. The result is simple: you move faster, and your code gets better.\n\nThe Profiler Agent can identify and fix performance issues in your code.\nBlazing fast performance\nSpeed shapes what you can build in a day. In 2026, the loops you run most – opening solutions, navigating code, building, and pressing F5 – tighten up. You’ll notice that first launch feels snappier, big solutions feel lighter, and the time between an idea and a running app keeps shrinking. The gains show up on large codebases and they hold across both x64 and Arm64, so your machine’s power turns directly into developer velocity.\nYou’ll feel it when you can jump between branches without losing your stride, when a full build doesn’t break your flow, and when pressing F5 is something you do instinctively because the wait is measured in moments.\nEarly feedback says it plainly:\n“HOLY […] this is FAST.” – early previewer\n“It’s blazing fast on all my projects.” – Visual Studio MVP\nA modern look and feel\nClarity matters when you live in an IDE. Visual Studio 2026 introduces a cleaner and more modern visual language. The result is a workspace that feels calm and intentional.\nYou’ll notice crisper lines, improved iconography, and better spacing of visual elements. Options feel approachable rather than overwhelming, so tuning the IDE to your preferences is quick instead of delicate.\nManaging extensions is straightforward, and a plethora of new color themes help your environment feel personal – comfortable for long sessions, focused when the pressure is on, and accessible by default.\nIt’s a design that respects your attention and helps you stay oriented, even in the largest solutions.\n\nVisual Studio 2026 redesigned using Fluent UI and ships with 11 new tinted themes\nTry it today\nReady to see the future of Visual Studio? You can get started right now:\nDownload Visual Studio 2026 Insider\nGet GitHub Copilot Free\nRead the release notes\nDeveloper Community Feedback\nVisual Studio 2026 installs side-by-side with earlier versions, and if you’re on Visual Studio 2022 you can import components and settings to get coding right away.\nThis is just the beginning. We’ll ship monthly updates that bring the latest performance improvements, design refinements, and AI innovations. And over the coming weeks, we’ll share deeper dives right here on the blog, so make sure to come back soon.\nThank you\nVisual Studio has always been about more than code – it’s about the community of developers who build, grow, and push us to make the IDE better every day. Thank you for being part of this journey and for making Visual Studio the IDE trusted by millions worldwide.\nHappy coding,\nThe Visual Studio Team\nKnown issue\nThere’s a known issue that can cause errors to show up for some users.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ever found yourself staring at the Output Window, overwhelmed by endless lines of logs and cryptic messages? You’re not alone! For years, developers have relied on the Output Window for critical build and debug information. But making sense of it—and translating it into action—has been a challenge. What if you could instantly ask questions about your logs and take action without leaving your workflow? Now you can, thanks to Copilot’s new Output Window context! \n\nSay hello to smarter output window assistance\nIn Visual Studio 17.14, Copilot can now read your Output Window, making it possible to interact with your build and debug logs like never before. Instead of wading through log files and searching for answers, simply ask Copilot questions about the output—whether you’re facing build errors, warnings, or just want to understand what’s happening behind the scenes. \nHow does the Output Window context work? \nIf you’re looking at the output window, you can highlight the logs you want Copilot to help you understand, right click and invoke Copilot Chat. This works in the Build, Debug, Tests, Source Control, Package Manager, or whatever is your active output window. Additionally, if you’re facing an issue, Copilot may opt to take a look on your behalf, especially if you mention the output window with natural language in your prompts. Copilot analyzes the contents of the Output Window, provides helpful explanations, and even suggests next steps.  \nWhy this feature matters for developers \nThe Output Window is a goldmine of information, but its sheer volume and complexity can slow you down. By bridging the gap between raw logs and actionable solutions, Copilot empowers you to debug faster, learn more, and focus on what matters—building great software. This integration is designed to boost productivity, reduce frustration, and help every developer, from beginner to expert, unlock the full power of Visual Studio. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub  \nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions.  \nAppreciation for your feedback  \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio. \nThe post Make Sense of Your Output Window with Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

최근 OpenAI가 GPT-5를 공개하면서 AI 업계는 물론, 우리 일상에도 큰 변화가 찾아왔습니다. 특히 가장 놀라운 소식은 이 강력한 최신 모델이 <b>무료 ChatGPT 사용자에게도 개방</b>되었다는 점인데요. 이제 더 이상 비싼 구독료를 내지 않아도 최신 AI 모델의 파워를 경험할 수 있게 된 거죠. 물론 무료 사용에는 약간의 제약이 있지만, 저의 경험상 일상적인 사용이나 가벼운 작업에는 전혀 부족함이 없었어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">GPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 것을 넘어, <b>작업의 종류를 스스로 판단하여 최적의 모델을 선택</b>해주는 '실시간 라우터' 기능까지 탑재했습니다. 이전처럼 GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini 같은 복잡한 모델들을 일일이 비교하며 고민할 필요가 없어진 거죠. 저는 이 부분이 정말 좋다고 생각해요. 우리가 필요한 건 결국 최고의 결과물이니까요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">학술 에세이부터 소셜 미디어 콘텐츠, 심지어 이미지 생성이나 코드 작성, 문서 요약 및 분석까지 &mdash; GPT-5는 정말 다재다능해요. 응답의 정확도는 45%나 향상되었고, 무엇보다 글쓰기 품질이 훨씬 자연스러워졌습니다. 아이디어 구상 단계에서는 거의 완벽에 가까운 파트너라고 할 수 있죠. 만약 ChatGPT의 답변이 '음, 좀 부족한데?' 싶을 때만 유료 구독을 고려해도 늦지 않을 거예요.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>  팁:</b> 무료 GPT-5 사용량은 정해져 있지만, 대부분의 캐주얼한 사용에는 충분합니다. 하지만 만약 AI의 답변 품질이 급격히 떨어진다고 느껴진다면, 일일 사용량 한도를 초과했을 가능성이 높으니 잠시 기다리거나 다른 무료 툴과 병행하는 것을 추천해요.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  GitHub Copilot: 코딩의 든든한 조력자</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발자라면 <u><b><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><a style=\"color: #006dd7;\" href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub Copilot</a></span></b></u>을 모르는 분이 거의 없을 겁니다. 그런데 이 강력한 코딩 AI를 <b>Visual Studio Code용 무료 버전</b>으로도 만날 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 매월 2,000건의 코드 완성 기능과 50건의 채팅 요청을 무료로 사용할 수 있어요. 하루 업무 시간으로 따지면 약 80건의 코드 완성 기능인데, 개인 프로젝트나 학습용으로는 정말 충분한 양이라고 생각해요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"vs code.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"988\" data-origin-height=\"704\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbgJVyJ%2FbtsQkVgdtaH%2F9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"vs code 용 GitHub Copilot\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"988\" height=\"704\" data-filename=\"vs code.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"988\" data-origin-height=\"704\"/></span></figure>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">놀랍게도 이 무료 플랜에는 OpenAI, Google, Anthropic 등 최고 수준의 AI 모델들이 포함되어 있습니다. 신용카드 정보나 별도의 가입 절차 없이 GitHub 계정만 있으면 바로 이용 가능하죠. 웹 툴과 Visual Studio Code 확장 프로그램 형태로 모두 제공되어, 개발자들이 가장 많이 사용하는 코드 에디터 내에서 편리하게 사용할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 전체 프로젝트의 골격을 만들거나, 코드 샘플 또는 바로 사용 가능한 저장소 구조를 몇 분 만에 얻을 수 있어요. 특히 Visual Studio Code에서 사용하면 전체 프로젝트를 인식하여 여러 파일과 동시에 작업할 수 있는 <b>'프로젝트 인지' 기능</b>은 정말 강력합니다. 그리고 무엇보다, 학생이나 교사, 혹은 인기 있는 오픈소스 프로젝트를 관리하는 분들은 Copilot Pro를 무료로 받을 수 있다는 사실! 학생분들은 이 혜택을 꼭 놓치지 말고 활용해보세요.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  Perplexity: 빠른 정보 탐색과 심층 연구의 동반자</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">어떤 주제에 대해 빠르게 정보를 찾아야 할 때, 저는 항상 <b><u><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><a style=\"color: #006dd7;\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perplexity</a></span></u></b>를 찾게 돼요. 이 툴은 기존의 전통적인 연구 방식을 완전히 대체하진 못하지만, 특정 주제에 대한 사전 지식이 조금이라도 있다면 <b>정보를 취합하고 정리하는 데 정말 유용</b>합니다. 특히 명확한 출처를 인용하고 대부분 실시간 정보를 제공한다는 점이 큰 장점이죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Perplexity의 무료 계정은 기본 검색은 무제한으로 제공하고, 매일 5번의 Pro 검색 기회를 줍니다. 또한 하루에 3개의 파일을 첨부하여 AI가 문서를 분석하게 할 수도 있어요. 제가 직접 써보니, 자료 조사나 팩트 체크, 문서 요약 등 웬만한 연구 요구사항은 무료 버전으로도 충분히 해결할 수 있었습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #fce8e6; border-left: 4px solid #d93025; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>⚠️ 주의:</b> 무료 버전에서는 AI가 쿼리에 가장 적합한 모델(Sonar, Claude Sonnet 4.0, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro 등)을 자동으로 선택하는데, 이 선택이 항상 완벽하지 않을 수도 있다는 점을 염두에 두세요. 때로는 기대 이하의 응답을 받을 수도 있습니다.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래도 매일 3번의 'Research' 기능을 이용할 수 있다는 점은 큰 이점이에요.

ChatGPT의 심층 연구 기능도 좋지만, 저는 Perplexity의 Research 검색이 더 정확하고 업데이트된 정보를 제공하는 경우가 많다고 느꼈어요. 확실히 자료 검색에 특화된 툴이라는 생각이 듭니다.\n  Leonardo.AI: 상상력을 현실로, 무료 이미지 생성\nAI 이미지 생성, 이제 어렵거나 비쌀 필요가 없습니다. Leonardo.AI는 온라인에서 사용할 수 있는 최고의 멀티 모델 이미지 생성 툴 중 하나인데요. 무료 계정으로 매일 150개의 토큰을 제공하며, 이를 통해 최대 25개의 16:9 비율 1184x672 해상도 이미지를 Flux Schnell 모델로 생성할 수 있어요.\nGPT-Image-1을 포함한 다양한 모델들이 있지만, 이미지 생성에 필요한 토큰 수는 모델마다 다릅니다. 현재로서는 Flux Schnell 모델이 가장 저렴하게 이미지를 만들 수 있어, 프롬프트를 테스트하고 초기 아이디어를 구체화하는 데 아주 적합해요. 저는 이 툴을 이용해 다양한 시안을 빠르게 만들어보곤 하는데, 정말 효율적입니다.\n\n\n또한, AI 기반의 프롬프트 개선 기능이 있어서 초보자도 쉽게 좋은 결과물을 얻을 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 다양한 사전 설정된 이미지 생성 스타일도 있어서 유튜브 썸네일부터 회사 로고까지, 몇 분 안에 비용 부담 없이 만들 수 있어요. Canva나 PhotoPea 같은 무료 이미지 편집기와 함께 사용하면 더더욱 훌륭한 결과물을 얻을 수 있으니 꼭 시도해보세요.\n  FlexClip: 간편하게 AI 비디오 제작 도전하기\nAI 이미지 생성에 이어 AI 비디오 생성에도 도전하고 싶으신가요? FlexClip은 다양한 AI 기반 도구들을 갖춘 온라인 플랫폼입니다. 이미지, 비디오, 음성 등 여러 가지를 생성할 수 있지만, 특히 강력한 AI 비디오 생성 기능과 편리한 편집 툴이 돋보이는 곳이에요.\n무료 플랜으로는 720p HD 해상도로 비디오를 다운로드할 수 있고, 최대 12개의 프로젝트를 생성할 수 있으며, 각 비디오는 최대 10분 길이까지 가능해요. 프로젝트당 하나의 스톡 비디오와 오디오도 제공됩니다. 특히, AI 비디오 생성기와 AI 스크립트 작성기를 포함한 FlexClip의 AI 툴을 10회까지 무료로 시도해볼 수 있다는 점이 매력적이에요.\n\n\n \n 간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 AI가 스크립트를 작성하고, 이 스크립트를 기반으로 AI가 이미지를 조합하여 비디오를 만들어주는 방식입니다. 다만, 생성되는 비디오가 대부분 AI 생성 이미지의 시퀀스에 AI 음성이 내레이션을 하는 형태라는 점은 알아두시면 좋아요. 아직은 '와!' 할 정도의 고품질 실사 영상을 무료로 얻기는 어렵지만, 컨셉 비디오나 설명 영상 제작에는 충분히 활용 가능합니다.\nAI 비디오 생성은 이미지 생성과 달리, 무료로 '제대로 쓸만한' 결과물을 제공하는 서비스를 찾기가 정말 어려워요. FlexClip은 Leonardo.AI와 비슷한 크레딧 시스템을 사용하며, 구독 없이도 추가 크레딧을 구매하여 더 많은 AI 툴을 사용할 수 있습니다. 갑자기 비디오가 필요할 때 아주 유용한 옵션이 될 거예요.\n  Ollama: 나만의 AI 비서, 로컬에서 실행하기\n진정한 '무료 AI'의 맛을 보고 싶다면, 저는 주저 없이 Ollama를 추천합니다. 이 툴은 강력한 오픈소스 AI 모델들을 인터넷 연결 없이, 사용량 제한 없이, 그리고 가장 중요한 개인 데이터 유출 걱정 없이 여러분의 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이 점이 가장 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.\nLlama 3.2, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral 같은 유명 모델들을 여러분의 하드웨어 사양만 충분하다면 돌려볼 수 있어요. Ollama의 라이브러리 페이지에 가면 지원되는 모델 목록을 볼 수 있는데, 정말 다양한 종류가 있어서 각자의 컴퓨터 환경에 맞는 모델을 선택하기 좋죠. 최근에는 OpenAI와의 파트너십을 통해 최신 오픈 가중치 모델들도 Ollama에서 사용할 수 있게 되었다고 하니, 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n \n설치도 믿을 수 없을 정도로 빠르고 쉬웠어요. Windows, Linux, macOS용 Ollama를 다운로드하고, 간단한 명령 한 줄이면 지원되는 어떤 모델이든 즉시 사용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Google의 오픈 가중치 AI 모델인 Gemma 3를 실행하고 싶다면 그저 ollama run gemma3라고 입력하면 끝이에요. 정말 간편하죠!\n물론 몇 가지 제약은 있습니다. 챗봇이 명령 프롬프트 창에서 실행되기 때문에 대화 기록 기능이나 파일 업로드 같은 편리한 기능은 기본적으로 제공되지 않아요. 로컬에 저장된 파일과 AI 모델을 상호작용하게 만들 수는 있지만, 약간의 프로그래밍 지식이 필요하긴 합니다.\n  팁: Ollama를 제대로 활용하려면 최소 8GB RAM(7B 모델용), 16GB RAM(13B 모델용), 32GB RAM(33B 모델용)이 필요합니다. 컴퓨터 사양을 미리 확인해보고 적절한 모델을 선택하는 것이 중요해요.\n이러한 제약에도 불구하고, 단 몇 단계만으로 나만의 AI 모델을 로컬에서 실행할 수 있다는 점은 AI를 깊이 있게 탐구하고 싶거나 AI 기반 앱을 개발하는 분들에게 Ollama가 아주 매력적인 툴이 될 수 있다는 생각이 들어요.\n  돈 한 푼 안 쓰고 AI 풀파워, 이제 여러분의 차례!\n지금까지 다양한 무료 AI 툴들을 살펴보았는데요. 중요한 것은 단순히 여러 툴을 사용하는 것이 아니라, 각 툴의 강점을 파악하고 여러분의 특정 작업에 전략적으로 조합하여 활용하는 것입니다. 제가 직접 경험해보니, 유료 AI 플랜에서 얻을 수 있는 대부분의 기능을 여러 전문화된 무료 툴들을 통해 비용 부담 없이 누릴 수 있었어요.\n2025년, 더 이상 AI 활용을 주저할 필요가 없습니다. 브레인스토밍부터 코딩, 리서치, 시각 콘텐츠 제작, 그리고 나만의 AI 환경 구축까지—오늘 소개해 드린 무료 AI 툴들을 잘 활용하여 여러분의 업무와 학습, 그리고 일상에 AI의 놀라운 생산성을 더해보세요. 스마트 워크의 진정한 마스터가 되는 길, 이제 여러분의 손에 달려 있습니다!\n  핵심 요약\n• 무료 AI 툴 조합은 현명한 선택: 각 툴의 강점을 활용해 유료 구독 없이도 강력한 AI 기능을 누릴 수 있습니다.\n• GPT-5 무료 제공으로 접근성 UP: ChatGPT의 최신 모델을 이제 무료로 경험하며 브레인스토밍과 콘텐츠 생산성을 극대화하세요.\n• 특화된 무료 툴로 효율 증대: GitHub Copilot(코딩), Perplexity(리서치), Leonardo.AI(이미지), FlexClip(비디오) 등 전문 분야 툴을 활용하세요.\n• Ollama로 로컬 AI 시대 개척: 개인 정보 유출 걱정 없이 강력한 AI 모델을 내 컴퓨터에서 직접 돌려보세요.\n이러한 무료 AI 툴들을 전략적으로 활용한다면, 유료 서비스 못지않은 효율과 생산성을 경험하실 수 있습니다. 지금 바로 여러분의 워크플로우에 AI를 추가해 보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: GPT-5가 무료로 제공되면서 어떤 점이 가장 좋아졌나요?\nA1: 이제 무료 사용자도 OpenAI의 최신 모델을 사용할 수 있게 되어 브레인스토밍과 콘텐츠 생성 시 훨씬 더 자연스럽고 정확한 결과물을 기대할 수 있습니다. 특히, AI가 작업에 가장 적합한 모델을 자동으로 선택해주는 통합 플랫폼이라 편리해요.\nQ2: 무료 AI 툴들을 효과적으로 조합하는 팁이 있을까요?\nA2: 네, 각 툴의 특장점을 명확히 이해하고 업무의 성격에 맞춰 전략적으로 활용하는 것이 중요해요. 예를 들어, 아이디어 구상에는 ChatGPT, 코딩에는 GitHub Copilot, 자료 조사에는 Perplexity를 사용하는 식이죠. 이렇게 역할 분담을 하면 유료 서비스 이상의 효과를 볼 수 있답니다.\nQ3: Ollama를 이용한 로컬 AI 환경 구축은 어떤 장점이 있나요?\nA3: 가장 큰 장점은 인터넷 연결 없이도 AI 모델을 내 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행할 수 있다는 점이에요. 이 덕분에 데이터 보안과 개인 정보 보호가 철저히 보장되고, 사용량 제한 걱정 없이 마음껏 AI를 활용하며 테스트할 수 있습니다.\nQ4: 무료 AI 이미지/비디오 생성 툴로도 고품질 결과물을 얻을 수 있나요?\nA4: 물론이죠!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 한 팟캐스트에서 습관에 대해 연구하는 작가의 인터뷰를 들었다. 이분이 최근에 출시한 책은 습관은 무엇이고, 어떻게 하면 큰 목표를 달성하기 위한 습관을 형성할 수 있는지에 대한 내용인데, 이 책을 출간하면서 가장 많이 참고했던 게 군대이고, 가장 많이 인터뷰했던 사람들이 군인이라고 한다. 특히 작가가 했던 말 중 내 기억에 인상 깊게 남았던 말은 “군대는 습관을 인위적으로 형성하는 거대한 기계”였다. 이 말을 하면서 예로 들었던 건, 이제 갓 고등학교를 졸업하고 입대한, 정말로 아무것도 모르는 18살짜리 애도 수색하다가 폭탄이 발견되면 완전히 기계같이 행동한다는 내용이었다.\n위의 예처럼 폭탄이 발견되면 기계같이 행동하는 군인들이 있지만, 또 그렇게 하지 않는 군인도 있는데, 어쨌든 전반적으로 군대 자체가 모두의 습관을 형성하는 거대한 기계의 역할을 하므로, 입대하면 어쩔 수 없이 이런 습관들이 다른 업종 사람들보다 더 잘 형성된다는 내용이었다. 나는 이 팟캐스트를 들으면서, 군대만큼 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계는 바로 스타트업이라는 생각을 했다.\n내가 아는 모든 창업가 중 사업을 오랫동안, 꾸준히 잘하는 분들은 모두 다 습관의 동물들이다. 실은 나도 스트롱벤처스를 만들었으니까 굳이 분류하자면 창업가라고 할 수 있는데, 나에게도 스트롱벤처스는 지난 13년 동안 습관을 – 좋은 습관도 있고 좋지 않은 습관도 있지만, 대부분 너무 좋은 습관 – 형성해 준 작은 기계와도 같다. 아마도 투자자로서의 습관, 그리고 실제로 사업을 운영하는 창업가로서의 습관은 조금 다르겠지만, 내가 창업가들을 관찰하면서 느끼는, 이들이 스타트업을 하기 때문에 형성된 가장 두드러진 습관은 우선순위를 파악하는 인지적 습관이다. 사업을 하다 보면 해야 할 일은 너무 많은데, 그 모든 것을 할 수 있는 시간과 돈은 턱없이 부족하다. 그리고 주위에서 잔소리와 훈계를 얼마나 많이 하는지. 이 모든 것을 무시하면서, 실제로 나에게 도움을 주는 조언과 도움이 전혀 되지 않는 잡음을 구분하고, 우리 회사에 도움이 되는 일에만 우선순위를 매기는 습관은 내가 아는 사람 중 창업가들이 가장 잘 한다.\n스타트업이 창업가들에게 기계적으로 형성시켜 주는 또 다른 습관은 행동하고, 이를 계속 반복하는 행동이다. 내가 자주 사용하는 말 중 하나가 “founders are machines of iteration”인데, 한정된 자원으로 좋은 제품을 만들다 보면, 어쩔 수 없이 이론보단 실제로 뭔가를 만들어 테스팅하고, 답이 없는 문제에 대해 오래 끙끙 고민하기보단 그냥 바로 실행하는 게 창업가들이다. 아주 훌륭한 습관이다.\n그리고 또 다른 습관은 위기에서 빠져나가서 살 수 있는 기회와 패턴을 남들보다 더 잘 볼 수 있는 것도 스타트업이 창업가들에게 단련시키는 습관 중 하나인 것 같다. 위기 앞에서 남들은 감정적으로 휩쓸리면서, 가장 덜 고통스럽게 포기하는 방법을 찾지만, 창업가들은 절대로 포기하지 않고, 이 위기를 극복할 방법을 습관적으로 찾게 되는데, 이건 스타트업이 아니었으면 아마도 형성되기 어려운 습관이지 않을까 생각한다.\n마지막으로, 아무리 좋아도 별로 좋아하지 않고, 아무리 나빠도 별로 낙담하지 않는, 일희일비하지 않는 습관이다. 내가 아는 대부분의 경험 많은 창업가들은 일희일비하지 않는다. 실은, 나도 비슷한 성향이긴 하지만, 그래도 너무 좋을 땐 기뻐하고, 너무 화가 날 땐 슬퍼하는 감정에 빠진다. 하지만, 내가 아는 정말 노련한 창업가들은 “이기면 다음 시합을 준비하고, 져도 다음 시합을 준비한다.”라는 덤덤한 마인드로 사업을 하고 인생을 사는데, 이것 또한 스타트업이라는 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계가 아니면 생길 수 없는 좋은 습관인 것 같다.\n위에서 언급한 습관들은 내가 지난 13년 동안 창업가들과 가깝게 지내면서 항상 감탄하면서 동시에 나도 내 습관으로 만들기 위해서 부단하게 노력하고 있는 그런 좋은 장점들인데, 어떻게 보면 이런 습관은 내가 항상 강조하는 창업가의 바퀴벌레와 같은 특성을 기반으로 형성되기도 하는 것 같다. 원래 바퀴벌레 특성을 가진 사람들이 창업하는 건지, 아니면 창업하게 되면 스타트업이라는 기계가 바퀴벌레의 습관을 형성하는 건진 잘 모르겠지만, 아마 둘 다이지 않을까 싶다.",

MLS는 왜 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수 영입에 집중하는 걸까요?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}‘경제공동체’로 묶인 MLS\nMLS의 구조는 일반적인 유럽 리그와 다릅니다. 30개 구단은 독립적으로 운영되지만, 동시에 MLS라는 기업의 지분을 가진 투자자이기도 합니다. 다시 말해 MLS 전체의 적자가 곧 구단의 적자가 되기 때문에 30개 구단은 하나의 경제 공동체로 묶여 있는 셈이죠.\n이 때문에 구단이 벌어들이는 입장 수입의 30%와 선수 이적료 수입의 25%는 MLS가 가져갑니다. 반대로 MLS가 확보한 전국 방송 중계권료와 리그 스폰서십 수익은 다시 구단에 배분됩니다. 이런 구조 덕분에 MLS는 ‘싱글 엔터티(Single Entity)’라는 독특한 운영 모델을 가지고 성장할 수 있었습니다.\n이를 상징하는 지표가 바로 신규 구단 창단 가입금(Expansion Fee)입니다. 신규 구단이 MLS의 ‘주주’가 되기 위해 내야 하는 금액인데, 이 금액이 폭등하고 있습니다. 2005년 104억 원 수준이던 가입금은 2023년 샌디에이고 FC 창단 당시 6,929억 원에 달했습니다. 18년 사이에 무려 70배 가까이 오른 것이죠. 이는 투자처로서 MLS의 가치가 얼마나 올라갔는지를 보여줍니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\nMLS의 성장에 함께한\n사커 맘, 히스패닉, NFL\nMLS의 성장에는 리그 구조뿐 아니라 사회·문화적 배경도 크게 작용했습니다. 대표적으로 1990년대 후반 ‘사커 맘’ 열풍이 있었습니다. 당시만 해도 미국에서 축구는 흔하지 않았고 비용도 많이 드는 스포츠였지만, 교외에 살던 중산층 어머니들은 자녀 교육과 또래 교류를 위해 축구를 선택했습니다. 그렇게 성장한 아이들은 자연스럽게 축구와 MLS에 친숙해졌습니다.\n히스패닉 팬덤도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. 현재 MLS 팬의 약 30%는 히스패닉입니다. 축구 강국 출신 이민자들은 MLS의 주요 팬층으로 자리 잡았고, MLS도 이들을 겨냥해 플로리다·캘리포니아 등 히스패닉 밀집 지역에 구단을 세웠습니다. 메시의 인터 마이애미와 손흥민의 LAFC가 대표적이죠. 더 나아가 MLS의 마케팅 자회사 SUM은 멕시코 대표팀의 미국 내 중계권과 스폰서십 권리까지 확보하며 안정적인 수익원을 마련했습니다.\nNFL과의 협력도 중요했습니다. MLS 상위 구단 대부분이 NFL 팀과 경기장을 공유합니다. 평균 관중 46,831명으로 MLS에서 가장 많은 관중을 모으는 애틀랜타 유나이티드의 경우, NFL 구단 애틀랜타 팰컨스와 같은 경기장을 홈으로 사용하고 있습니다. NFL은 시즌당 홈 경기가 8회뿐이어서 경기장 활용도를 높이기 위해 MLS와 협력하는 것이 유리했습니다. 반대로 MLS는 새로운 축구 전용 경기장을 짓지 않고 NFL 경기장을 활용하면서 비용을 줄일 수 있었죠.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}애틀랜타 팰컨스와 애틀랜타 유나이티드가 함께 사용하는 Mercedes-Benz Stadium / 사진: Sipa USA\nMLS의 경영 철학은\n연봉 지출 최소화\nMLS는 리그 사업권과 선수 계약권을 직접 소유하고 있습니다. 구단은 단지 그 권리를 위임받아 운영할 뿐이죠. 그래서 모든 구단은 리그가 정한 규칙 안에서 움직여야 합니다. MLS 소속 선수들이 똑같이 아디다스 유니폼을 입는 것도 같은 맥락입니다.\n이런 구조 속에서 MLS는 철저히 비용 통제를 이어왔습니다. 대표적인 장치가 샐러리 캡(Salary Cap)*입니다. 2025년 기준으로 MLS 한 팀이 쓸 수 있는 연봉 총액은 약 83억 원. 미국 4대 프로스포츠(NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)와 비교하면 확연히 낮은 수준입니다.\n* 팀이 선수 연봉에 쓸 수 있는 총액을 제한하는 제도\n\n짠물 경영은 구단 운영 안정성에는 도움이 됐지만, 미국 축구의 저변 확대에는 큰 걸림돌이 되었습니다. 운동 능력이 뛰어난 유망주들이 더 많은 연봉을 보장받을 수 있는 야구·농구·미식축구 대신 굳이 축구를 선택할 이유가 없었던 것이죠. 자유계약(FA) 제도마저 없어 연봉 대박을 노릴 기회도 없으니, MLS는 재능 있는 인재들을 끌어들이지 못했습니다.\n이 때문에 미국 대표팀 성적이 부진할 때마다 MLS의 낮은 연봉 정책은 도마에 올랐습니다. 그러나 리그는 쉽게 방향을 틀 수 없었습니다. 1968년부터 1984년까지 운영되던 북미사커리그(NASL)가 과도한 연봉 지출로 몰락한 전례가 있었기 때문입니다. 당시 NASL은 펠레, 베켄바워, 크루이프 같은 슈퍼스타에게 천문학적인 돈을 쓰다 결국 도산했죠.\n스타 선수를 데려오기 위해\nMLS가 도입한 제도\nMLS는 오랫동안 샐러리 캡을 무기로 선수 인건비를 억제해왔습니다. 하지만 2000년대 중반, 리그는 스타 파워 부족이라는 고민에 직면했습니다. 세계적인 선수를 데려오려면 이적료뿐 아니라 고액 연봉이 필수인데, 샐러리 캡 안에서는 불가능했기 때문입니다.\n결국 2007년, 데이비드 베컴이 LA 갤럭시에 합류하면서 새로운 제도가 도입됐습니다. 바로 ‘지정 선수 제도(일명 베컴 룰)’입니다. 한 팀에서 최대 3명까지는 연봉을 샐러리 캡 적용에서 제외할 수 있도록 한 것이죠. 여기에 MLS는 일반 할당금(General Allocation Money)과 목표 할당금(Targeted Allocation Money)이라는 장치도 추가했습니다. 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수를 데려올 때 MLS가 이적료와 연봉의 일부를 지원하는 방식입니다.\n2025년 기준으로 모든 구단은 연간 약 40억 원의 일반 할당금과 30억 원의 목표 할당금을 배정받습니다. 이 제도 덕분에 제라드, 램파드, 루니, 앙리, 즐라탄 같은 유럽의 빅스타들이 차례로 MLS로 건너왔습니다. 미국 팬들에게는 친숙한 얼굴들이었고, 이는 곧 MLS의 대중적 인지도와 팬덤 확장으로 이어졌습니다.\n하지만 부작용도 있었습니다. 리그가 은퇴 직전의 베테랑들을 끌어모으면서 MLS는 펜션 리그(Pension League)라는 꼬리표를 달게 됐습니다. 전성기를 지난 선수들이 마지막으로 연금을 챙기는 무대라는 비아냥이었죠. 그만큼 젊은 유망주 육성은 뒷전이 됐고, 리그가 미국 축구의 경쟁력 강화보다는 수익 극대화에만 치중한다는 비판이 뒤따랐습니다.\nEPL 견제를 위해\nMLS가 선택한 메시\n미국 4대 프로 스포츠*는 세계 최고 수준의 경기력과 산업 규모를 갖추고 있어 해외 리그를 경쟁 상대로 두지 않습니다. 하지만 MLS는 다릅니다. 세계 최고 수준의 프로 축구 리그가 유럽에 있고, 그중에서도 EPL(잉글랜드 프리미어리그)은 이미 미국 시장에서 막강한 팬덤을 확보했습니다. NBC가 EPL 중계권에 매년 6,238억 원을 지불하는 이유도 여기에 있습니다. 이는 애플TV가 MLS 중계권에 지불하는 금액(3,466억 원)의 거의 두 배죠.\n* NFL(미식축구), NBA(농구), MLB(야구), NHL(아이스하키)\nEPL의 영향력이 커지자 MLS는 새로운 도전을 시작해야 했고, 답은 명확했습니다. 당장 펜션 리그라는 비난을 받더라도 스타 선수 영입에 더 과감한 투자를 하는 것이었습니다. 경기력이나 상품성에서 당장 유럽 리그를 능가할 수는 없지만, EPL이 미국 시장을 잠식하는 것을 막기 위해서는 세계적인 아이콘을 확보할 필요가 있었죠.\n\nFC 바르셀로나에서 뛰던 베테랑 선수들을 대거 영입한 인터 마이애미 / 사진: Action Images\n그 선택은 리오넬 메시였습니다. 2023년, 살아 있는 전설, 메시는 인터 마이애미 유니폼을 입었습니다. 2025년 그의 연봉은 약 278억 원. MLS에서 이 숫자는 사실상 천문학적인 수준입니다. 메시 한 명의 연봉보다 팀 전체 연봉이 낮은 구단이 무려 21개에 달합니다. 아디다스 후원 계약과 MLS 중계 파트너 애플TV의 수익 공유까지 포함하면, 그의 연간 수입은 400억 원 이상으로 추정됩니다.\n메시 효과는 즉각적으로 나타났습니다. 애플TV의 MLS 중계 구독자 수는 두 배로 늘었고, 리그 스폰서십 수익은 13% 증가했습니다. 홈과 원정 경기를 가리지 않고 구름 관중이 몰려들었고, 메시가 이끄는 인터 마이애미는 2024년 정규리그 우승(서포터스 쉴드)을 차지했습니다. 동시에 MLS 구단 가운데 가장 많은 수입(약 2,501억 원)과 영업이익(695억 원)을 기록하며, ‘스타 한 명이 리그 전체를 바꿀 수 있다’는 사실을 입증했죠.\n펜션 리그 꼬리표를\n떼줄 선수, 손흥민\n2025년, 손흥민이 MLS 역대 최고 이적료인 367억 원을 기록하며 LAFC에 합류했습니다. 이 영입은 세계 축구의 중심을 노리는 MLS의 전략과, 리그 최고 클럽을 지향하는 LAFC의 야심이 맞아떨어진 결과였습니다.\n38세로 선수 생활 황혼기에 접어든 메시와 달리 손흥민은 아직 33세입니다. 앞으로 2~3년은 정상급 기량을 발휘할 수 있는 나이죠. 미국 내에서도 손흥민은 여전히 젊고 에너지가 넘치는 선수로 평가받습니다. 손흥민의 합류는 MLS가 오랫동안 따라붙은 ‘펜션 리그’ 이미지를 희석할 수 있는 카드였습니다.\nLAFC 역시 손흥민을 간절히 원했습니다. EPL 득점왕 출신인 손흥민은 ‘젊은 베테랑’으로서 여전히 월드 클래스 스타입니다. 계약 연장 옵션을 포함하면 2029년까지 활약할 수 있어, 명문 구단을 꿈꾸는 LAFC의 비전에 정확히 부합하는 자원이라고 할 수 있습니다.\n실제 성적과 구단 가치도 이를 뒷받침합니다. 2018년 MLS에 참가한 LAFC는 정규리그 우승 2회(2019, 2022), MLS 컵 우승 1회(2022)를 기록하며 꾸준히 좋은 성적을 내왔습니다. 2024년 기준 구단 가치는 1조 7,366억 원으로 MLS 전체 1위. 두터운 팬층을 바탕으로 안정적인 수익 모델을 갖추고 있다는 점에서, 메시 합류 전까지 관중 수 최하위였던 인터 마이애미와는 분명한 차별성을 보여줍니다. 게다가 LA가 약 23만 명으로 추산되는 한인 교민 사회라는 점도 매력적인 이유죠.\n\n미국에서 여전히 정상급 기량을 보이는 손흥민 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\nMLS가 북중미 월드컵에 거는 기대\nMLS는 수익 확대 측면에서는 분명 성공한 리그입니다. 하지만 아직 풀어야 할 숙제가 남아 있습니다. 리그 하부 구조를 튼튼히 하려면 유소년 육성 프로그램에 더 많은 관심과 투자가 필요합니다. 그래야 젊은 유망주들이 MLS에서 활약하면서 리그 경쟁력을 높일 수 있겠죠. 이를 위해 가장 먼저 개선해야 할 부분은 낮은 평균 연봉입니다. 지금처럼 연봉이 낮다면, 재능 있는 인재들이 다른 종목으로 빠져나가는 문제를 해결하기 어렵기 때문이죠.\n1994년 미국 월드컵은 MLS 창설의 출발점이었습니다. 2026년 북중미 월드컵은 MLS가 크게 도약할 기회입니다. 이를 위해서는 무엇보다 리그에서 활약하는 월드컵 스타들이 더 많이 등장해야 합니다. MLS 선수들이 월드컵 무대에서 주목받는다면, 리그의 위상은 물론 선수들의 몸값과 연봉 수준까지 자연스럽게 높아질 수 있을 것입니다.\n만약 한국 대표팀의 경기가 LA에서 열리고, 손흥민이 그 무대에서 대활약을 펼친다면 어떨까요. 그는 LAFC를 넘어 MLS 전체의 롤 모델이 될 가능성이 큽니다. 어쩌면 이것이야말로 손흥민이 MLS 이적을 결심한 결정적 이유일지도 모릅니다. 한국 대표팀 주장으로 쌓아온 그의 여정이 북중미 월드컵에서 해피엔딩으로 이어지길 기대해봅니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",
