There were no tool changes as of the date of the registry release in August, though more changes will be listed in the next release in September.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,666 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n14 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n240 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n86 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,000 forks and 25,500 stars on GitHub.\nGitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg\nEarlier this month, we announced GitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg. This allows GitHub users to receive automated PRs to upgrade their vcpkg versioning baselines. Since that announcement, the automated PRs have been updated to include information about the vcpkg release being upgraded to, including port counts per triplet, as well as a list of impacted ports and their original vs. new versions. Here is an example of one of the new PRs.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.08.27 release)\nNo tool updates as of 2025.08.27. More tool updates will be included in next month’s release.\nDocumentation changes\nAdded documentation covering Dependabot support for vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#512, thanks @JamieMagee!).\nOther minor documentation fixes.\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2453\n\n\nx64-windows\n2575\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2575\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2450\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2507\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1452\n\n\narm64-windows\n2181\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2163\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1421\n\n\nx64-osx\n2446\n\n\narm64-osx\n2376\n\n\nx64-linux\n2568\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1998\n\n\nx64-android\n2059\n\n\narm64-android\n2021\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how Meta is applying machine learning (ML) and diversity algorithms to improve notification quality and user experience. \nWe’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework to reduce uniformity and deliver a more varied and engaging mix of notifications.\nThis new framework reduces the volume of notifications and drives higher engagement rates through more diverse outreach.\nNotifications are one of the most powerful tools for bringing people back to Instagram and enhancing engagement. Whether it’s a friend liking your photo, another close friend posting a story, or a suggestion for a reel you might enjoy, notifications help surface moments that matter in real time.\nInstagram leverages machine learning (ML) models to decide who should get a notification, when to send it, and what content to include. These models are trained to optimize for user positive engagement such as click-through-rate (CTR) – the probability of a user clicking a notification – as well as other metrics like time spent.\nHowever, while engagement-optimized models are effective at driving interactions, there’s a risk that they might overprioritize the product types and authors someone has previously engaged with. This can lead to overexposure to the same creators or the same product types while overlooking other valuable and diverse experiences. \nThis means people could miss out on content that would give them a more balanced, satisfying, and enriched experience. Over time, this can make notifications feel spammy and increase the likelihood that people will disable them altogether. \nThe real challenge lies in finding the right balance: How can we introduce meaningful diversity into the notification experience without sacrificing the personalization and relevance people on Instagram have come to expect?\nTo tackle this, we’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework that helps deliver more diverse, better curated, and less repetitive notifications. This framework has significantly reduced daily notification volume while improving CTR. It also introduces several benefits:\nThe extensibility of incorporating customized soft penalty (demotion) logic for each dimension, enabling more adaptive and sophisticated diversity strategies.\nThe flexibility of tuning demotion strength across dimensions like content, author, and product type via adjustable weights.\nThe integration of balancing personalization and diversity, ensuring notifications remain both relevant and varied.\nThe Risks of Notifications without Diversity\nThe issue of overexposure in notifications often shows up in two major ways:\nOverexposure to the same author: People might receive notifications that are mostly about the same friend. For example, if someone often interacts with content from a particular friend, the system may continue surfacing notifications from that person alone – ignoring other friends they also engage with. This can feel repetitive and one-dimensional, reducing the overall value of notifications.\nOverexposure to the same product surface: People might mostly receive notifications from the same product surface such as Stories, even when Feed or Reels could provide value. For example, someone may be interested in both reel and story notifications but has recently interacted more often with stories. Because the system heavily prioritizes past engagement, it sends only story notifications, overlooking the person’s broader interests. \nIntroducing Instagram’s Diversity-Aware Notification Ranking Framework\nInstagram’s diversity-aware notification ranking framework is designed to enhance the notification experience by balancing the predicted potential for user engagement with the need for content diversity. This framework introduces a diversity layer on top of the existing engagement ML models, applying multiplicative penalties to the candidate scores generated by these models, as figure1, below, shows.\nThe diversity layer evaluates each notification candidate’s similarity to recently sent notifications across multiple dimensions such as content, author, notification type, and product surface. It then applies carefully calibrated penalties—expressed as multiplicative demotion factors—to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive. The adjusted scores are used to re-rank the candidates, enabling the system to select notifications that maintain high engagement potential while introducing meaningful diversity. In the end, the quality bar selects the top-ranked candidate that passes both the ranking and diversity criteria.\nFigure.1: Instagram’s diversity-aware ranking framework where the diversity layer sits on top of the existing modeling layer and penalizes notifications that are too similar to recently sent ones.\nMathematical Formulation \nWithin the diversity layer, we apply a multiplicative demotion factor to the base relevance score of each candidate. Given a notification candidate 𝑐, we compute its final score as the product of its base ranking score and a diversity demotion multiplier:\n\n\nwhere R(c) represents the candidate’s base relevance score, and D(c) ∈ [0,1] is a penalty factor that reduces the score based on similarity to recently sent notifications. We define a set of semantic dimensions (e.g., author, product type) along which we want to promote diversity. For each dimension i, we compute a similarity signal pi(c) between candidate c and the set of historical notifications H, using a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) approach:\n\nwhere simi(·,·) is a predefined similarity function for dimension i. In our baseline implementation, pi(c) is binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a threshold 𝜏i and 0 otherwise. \nThe final demotion multiplier is defined as: \n\n\nwhere each wi  ∈ [0,1] controls the strength of demotion for its respective dimension. This formulation ensures that candidates similar to previously delivered notifications along one or more dimensions are proportionally down-weighted, reducing redundancy and promoting content variation. The use of a multiplicative penalty allows for flexible control across multiple dimensions, while still preserving high-relevance candidates.\nThe Future of Diversity-Aware Ranking\nAs we continue evolving our notification diversity-aware ranking system, a next step is to introduce more adaptive, dynamic demotion strategies. Instead of relying on static rules, we plan to make demotion strength responsive to notification volume and delivery timing. For example, as a user receives more notifications—especially of similar type or in rapid succession—the system progressively applies stronger penalties to new notification candidates, effectively mitigating overwhelming experiences caused by high notification volume or tightly spaced deliveries.\nLonger term, we see an opportunity to bring large language models (LLMs) into the diversity pipeline. LLMs can help us go beyond surface-level rules by understanding semantic similarity between messages and rephrasing content in more varied, user-friendly ways. This would allow us to personalize notification experiences with richer language and improved relevance while maintaining diversity across topics, tone, and timing.\nThe post A New Ranking Framework for Better Notification Quality on Instagram appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Think of it as a USB-C port for AI: a consistent way to plug the AI models your AI agent uses into specific tools and data sources. \nYou can connect Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, to a wide variety of officially provided or community built MCP servers, or build your own MCP server using one of the available SDKs – including the brand-new MCP PHP SDK.\nAbout MCP PHP SDK\nMCP SDKs are lightweight frameworks that handle the protocol details so that developers can focus on the application functionality that AI agents will use.\nMCP PHP SDK is the official MCP SDK built as a joint effort by the PHP Foundation, Anthropic’s MCP team, and Symfony. The goal of the project is to provide a framework-agnostic, production-ready reference implementation the PHP ecosystem can rely on. For details about using MCP PHP SDK or contributing to it, see modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk.\nJunie + MCP\nWhether you are building your own MCP server or using an existing one, here’s how to make it work with the Junie AI agent in PhpStorm:\nMake sure that the MCP server can be accessed and started. \nThe specific way of starting an MCP server depends on this server’s implementation – please refer to the MCP server documentation for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Junie in PhpStorm to connect. \nTo add the MCP server to Junie, press ⇧Shift twice to open the search window and search for “MCP Settings”. On the MCP Settings page, you can see the list of connected servers and add or edit JSON configurations for the MCP servers in the ~/.junie/mcp.json file.\n\nTo configure an MCP server at the project level, manually add an mcp.json file with your desired server configurations to the .junie/mcp folder in the project root.\nTo view the list of actions that Junie can perform through a configured MCP server, locate the server in the MCP Settings list and expand the Status drop-down list.\n\nFor example, with the Laravel Boost MCP server, Junie gets useful tools for working with Laravel projects, such as listing Artisan commands, routes, or config files, reading logs, querying the database, or searching versioned documentation.\nThis is where MCP shines: It bridges the gap between LLMs and dynamic, framework- and project-specific context and data.\n\n\n\n\nStart using new commands and context inside your IDE. \nWhen running a prompt, Junie analyzes what commands registered with the configured MCP servers are relevant, and executes them through the respective MCP server.\n\nThe Junie coding agent keeps evolving. Join the conversation in our Junie Discord community and help shape what’s next for Junie.\nNew chapter for MCP servers in PHP\nWhile you could use any SDK implementation to create MCP servers for PHP projects, the official MCP PHP SDK boosts the contribution of the PHP community into the AI ecosystem, both within the PHP realm and beyond.\nThe PHP SDK maintainers encourage PHP developers to submit their MCP integrations for PHP frameworks and tools – Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, custom APIs, and more – to be listed in the SDK GitHub repo.",

        "title": "5 Ways Static Code Analysis Can Improve Developer Experience",

        "pubDate": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:28:03 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Improve developer experience with static code analysis. \n\n\n\nDeveloper experience is not only about nice editors and fast build times. It is about reducing friction so developers can focus on solving problems rather than fighting with tools. Among the most effective developer experience tools available today is static code analysis. By examining code without running it, static analysis surfaces potential issues early and helps teams deliver higher-quality software, faster.\nResearch from Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey showed that “Public search engines are the top resource used by professional developers to find answers to technical questions. 55% use traditional search and 15% use AI-powered search, either free or paid”. But what if the tools we work in to improve code quality and security to help provide those answers with in-context learning? \nThis is just one of the ways that static code analysis can significantly improve developer experience.  The same research found that developers had high levels of frustration with technical debt, tech stack complexity and the reliability of the tools they use – all of which we’ve taken into account when developing Qodana’s roadmap.  \n\n\n\n\nThis research, as well as anecdotal sharing and common research findings, shows that developers have a lot of frustration in their daily workflows, so how else can static code analysis help? Today, we’re highlighting 5 ways: \n1. Faster feedback loops\nWaiting for a build to complete or a test suite to run slows momentum. Static code analysis integrates directly into the development environment or CI pipeline, providing almost immediate insights into potential bugs, style violations, or security vulnerabilities. \nInstead of context switching between writing code and waiting for feedback, developers can fix problems as they code. Faster feedback loops shorten the distance between writing and validating, which keeps developers in the flow.\n2. Reduced cognitive load\nModern systems are complex, and keeping all the rules, patterns, and security practices in mind while coding is unrealistic. Static code analysis acts as a safety net, catching violations of coding standards, identifying unsafe constructs, and reminding developers of best practices. \nThis reduces the mental overhead of remembering every guideline and allows developers to concentrate on design and problem solving. Over time, this makes coding less stressful and improves overall team productivity.\n3. Improved code quality and consistency\nTeams often struggle with inconsistent coding styles or subtle bugs that slip into production. Static code analysis enforces coding standards across the project, ensuring consistency and readability. \nIt can detect common error patterns like null pointer dereferences, uninitialized variables, or unused imports before they cause real issues. By automatically highlighting these concerns, static analysis tools improve the reliability of the codebase and build long term maintainability.\n4. Time savings across the lifecycle\nFixing a defect after release is many times more expensive than resolving it during development. Static code analysis catches problems at the earliest stage, reducing the need for long QA cycles or emergency hotfixes – and Qodana has quick fixes. \nIt also helps reviewers by pre-filtering trivial issues, so code reviews can focus on architecture and logic instead of formatting or lint-level concerns. Developers spend less time on rework and more time on meaningful progress.\nIn some cases, like with Qodana, capability extends beyond simple analysis with checks for security vulnerabilities, license incompatibilities and malicious injections. These massively contribute to compliance issues and time spent when they aren’t detected out the gate, so detection saves time and legal issues. \n5. Integration with modern developer experience tools\nStatic code analysis is most effective when combined with other developer experience tools. For example, integrating analysis with CI/CD pipelines creates automated quality gates that block unsafe or noncompliant code before it reaches production. \nConnecting with IDEs provides inline feedback during coding sessions. Qodana can even align findings with compliance standards, making it easier for enterprises to ensure both quality and security.\n\n\n\n\nStatic code analysis is more than a safety net to catch errors. It can genuinely improve developer experience. By offering faster feedback, reducing cognitive load, improving code quality, saving time, and integrating with the wider developer toolchain, it helps teams deliver better software with less friction. \nFor organizations that want to support their developers, adopting static code analysis is an essential step toward a healthier and more productive workflow.\nContribute to better developer experiences in your organization\nIf you want to improve developer experience and remove obstacles, you can support the teams in your organization with a reliable code quality and security tool. \nTry Qodana",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/09/improved-annotation-handling-in-kotlin-2-2-less-boilerplate-fewer-surprises/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 11:56:15 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Many developers have run into subtle issues with annotations when working with Kotlin and frameworks like Spring or JPA-based persistence frameworks. For instance, an annotation applied to a constructor parameter might not always end up in the property or backing field where the framework expects it.\nThis often means annotations don’t land where they’re needed. For example, bean validation checks might only happen when the object was first created, but not when its properties were later updated. The result? Confusing bugs, surprising runtime behavior, and sometimes even the need to dig into bytecode to see what’s really going on. For example, validation might not be enforced when entities are loaded or updated from the database.\nWith Kotlin 2.2, we’re addressing this problem. A new default rule makes annotations land where developers expect them to, reducing boilerplate and aligning better with popular frameworks.\nConsider this simple JPA entity:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @NotBlank\n    var name: String,\n\n    @Email\n    var email: String\n)\nAt first glance this looks correct. But in Kotlin versions before 2.2, the default rule applied these annotations only to the constructor parameter (@param).\nIf we look at the decompiled code, it actually becomes:\npublic class Order {\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  private final long id;\n\n  @NotNull\n  private String name;\n\n  @NotNull\n  private String email;\n\n  public Order(long id, @NotBlank @NotNull String name, @Email @NotNull String email) {\n      Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(name, \"name\");\n      Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(email, \"email\");\n      super();\n      this.id = id;\n      this.name = name;\n      this.email = email;\n   }\n…\n}\nValidation annotations like @NotBlank and @Email weren’t placed on the field/property – they only validated object construction, not property updates.\nThis mismatch has been a common source of confusion.\nPrevious workaround: Explicit use-site targets\nThe fix was to explicitly mark the targets, for example with @field:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @field:Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @field:NotNull\n    var name: String,\n\n    @field:Email\n    var email: String\n)\nso that becomes:\npublic class Order {\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  private final long id;\n\n  @NotBlank\n  @NotNull\n  private String name;\n\n  @Email\n  @NotNull\n  private String email;\n…\n}\nThis approach works, but clutters the code with extra syntax. It also requires developers to know about Kotlin’s use-site targets and remember which one each framework expects.\nKotlin 2.2: A new default that just works\nStarting with Kotlin 2.2, annotations without an explicit use-site target are applied to the constructor parameter and the property or field, aligning behavior with what most frameworks expect.\nThat means our original code now works as expected, without requiring any additional annotations:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @NotBlank\n    var name: String,\n\n    @Email\n    var email: String\n)\nWith the new rule:\nBean validation annotations are present on the property, so validation applies on updates as well as on constructions.\nThe code looks like clean and idiomatic Kotlin, without repetitive @field: syntax or surprising behavior.\nHow to enable the new behavior\n🔗 Kotlin 2.2 is required.\nBy default, the compiler issues warnings if your code’s behavior may change under the new rule.\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, you can also use the quick-fix on a warning to enable the new default project-wide.\n\n\n\n\nTo switch fully to the new behavior in your project, enable it in IntelliJ IDEA via Gradle’s settings.\nAdd the following to your build.gradle.kts:\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-default-target=param-property\")\n    }\n}\n\nIf you prefer to keep the old behavior, you can use:\n\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-defaulting=first-only\")\n    }\n}\nOr stay in a transitional mode with warnings:\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-defaulting=first-only-warn\")\n    }\n}\nWhy this matters\nThis change makes annotation behavior more predictable, reduces boilerplate, and eliminates a class of subtle bugs that Spring and JPA developers have faced for years. It’s also a step toward making Kotlin’s integration with major frameworks smoother.\nMore details can be found in KT-73255 and KEEP-402.\nThis update is part of our broader initiative to improve the Kotlin + Spring experience. Stay tuned for more inspections, tooling improvements, and language updates that make working with these frameworks even better.\nHappy coding!",

The partnership provided us with quality data about vulnerable and malicious packages, allowing our IDEs and Qodana to spot them for you in your projects.\nOver the last few months, we have been working on integrating additional data about vulnerable APIs in open-source libraries, provided by the software composition analysis (SCA) data provider. That data has now been delivered to our Package Checker plugin, making it an even more effective tool for maintaining code security.\nThe Vulnerable API feature\nThe Package Checker plugin is powered by data from Mend.io about vulnerable APIs and provides code security analysis to detect the usage of vulnerable methods from open-source libraries. \nOur team has recently been working on enriching Mend.io data to cover more public methods from open-source libraries by analyzing call graphs. This means that the plugin has more data at its disposal than ever before, covering more cases.\nThe plugin’s Vulnerable API feature works for various languages, including Java, Kotlin, C# (in Rider and ReSharper), JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. Here’s how to make sure all the necessary inspections are enabled in the active inspection profile:\nFirst, open the IDE settings (⌘, on macOS or Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows/Linux) and go to Editor | Inspections. \nIn the search bar, type “Vulnerable API” and you’ll see the list of related inspections (the final list depends on the plugins you have installed). \nSimply select the ones you need from the list.\n\n\n\n\nThe Settings window\nHow to use it\nThe inspections provided by the Vulnerable API feature will highlight vulnerable methods from open-source libraries in your code. When you hover over the highlighted code, you’ll see a list of vulnerabilities found in a given API call. To address the problem, pull up the context actions (⌥⏎ on macOS or Alt+Enter on Windows/Linux) and select Go to file with declared dependency from the menu. \n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API highlighting \nThis will take you to the place in the build file where the dependency is declared. There, you can again use ⌥⏎ (on macOS) or Alt+Enter (on Windows/Linux) and select Update to unaffected version. The vulnerability list contains links to additional information in the Mend.io vulnerability database.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable dependency highlighting\nThe Package Checker plugin also provides a way to see the list of vulnerabilities in a dedicated window inside the IDE without opening a browser. You can simply use the Show all… link. This will take you to the Vulnerable Dependencies window, which shows the overall state of the project and provides information about every detected vulnerable dependency.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerable Dependencies window\nThe Vulnerable API and Vulnerable Dependencies features are available in Qodana and can be used in CI/CD or security assessment processes.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API feature in Qodana\nLooking ahead\nThese improvements strengthen the existing code security features in JetBrains IDEs and Qodana by providing enhanced vulnerability detection capabilities. Update your IDE to the latest version and enable the Vulnerable API inspections to identify security risks in your codebase.\nYou can learn more about the Package Checker plugin from its page on JetBrains Marketplace, and you can find more information about how to use it in the documentation.

Our insights from the State of Python 2025 offer a snapshot of what frameworks developers are using in 2025.\nIn this article, we’ll look at the most popular Python frameworks and libraries. While some long-standing favorites like Django and Flask remain strong, newer contenders like FastAPI are rapidly gaining ground in areas like AI, ML, and data science.\n1. FastAPI\n2024 usage: 38% (+9% from 2023)\nTop of the table is FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+. It was designed to combine Python’s type hinting, asynchronous programming, and OpenAPI standards into a single, developer-friendly package. \nBuilt on top of Starlette (for the web layer) and Pydantic (for data validation), FastAPI offers automatic request validation, serialization, and interactive documentation, all with minimal boilerplate.\nFastAPI is ideal for teams prioritizing speed, simplicity, and standards. It’s especially popular among both web developers and data scientists.\nFastAPI advantages\nGreat for AI/ML: FastAPI is widely used to deploy machine learning models in production. It integrates well with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, and supports async model inference pipelines for maximum throughput.\nAsynchronous by default: Built on ASGI, FastAPI supports native async/await, making it ideal for real-time apps, streaming endpoints, and low-latency ML services.\nType-safe and modern: FastAPI uses Python’s type hints to auto-validate requests and generate clean, editor-friendly code, reducing runtime errors and boosting team productivity.\nAuto-generated docs: FastAPI creates interactive documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc, making it easy for teams to explore and test endpoints without writing any extra docs.\nStrong community momentum: Though it’s relatively young, FastAPI has built a large and active community and has a growing ecosystem of extensions, tutorials, and integrations.\nFastAPI disadvantages\nSteeper learning curve for asynchronous work: async/await unlocks performance, but debugging, testing, and concurrency management can challenge developers new to asynchronous programming.\nBatteries not included: FastAPI lacks built-in tools for authentication, admin, and database management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these manually.\nSmaller ecosystem: FastAPI’s growing plugin landscape still trails Django’s, with fewer ready-made tools for tasks like CMS integration or role-based access control.\n2. Django\n2024 usage: 35% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango once again ranks among the most popular Python frameworks for developers.\nOriginally built for rapid development with built-in security and structure, Django has since evolved into a full-stack toolkit. It’s trusted for everything from content-heavy websites to data science dashboards and ML-powered services.\nIt follows the model-template-view (MTV) pattern and comes with built-in tools for routing, data access, and user management. This allows teams to move from idea to deployment with minimal setup.\nDjango advantages\nBatteries included: Django has a comprehensive set of built-in tools, including an ORM, a user authenticator, an admin panel, and a templating engine. This makes it ideal for teams that want to move quickly without assembling their own stack.\nSecure by default: It includes built-in protections against CSRF, SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities. Django’s security-first approach is one reason it’s trusted by banks, governments, and large enterprises.\nScalable and production-ready: Django supports horizontal scaling, caching, and asynchronous views. It’s been used to power high-traffic platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus.\nExcellent documentation: Django’s official docs are widely praised for their clarity and completeness, making it accessible to developers at all levels.\nMature ecosystem: Thousands of third-party packages are available for everything from CMS platforms and REST APIs to payments and search.\nLong-term support: Backed by the Django Software Foundation, Django receives regular updates, security patches, and LTS releases, making it a safe choice for long-term projects.\nDjango disadvantages\nHeavyweight for small apps: For simple APIs or microservices, Django’s full-stack approach can feel excessive and slow to configure.\nTightly coupled components: Swapping out parts of the stack, such as the ORM or templating engine, often requires workarounds or deep customization.\nSteeper learning curve: Django’s conventions and depth can be intimidating for beginners or teams used to more minimal frameworks.\n3. Flask\n2024 usage: 34% (+1% from 2023)\nFlask is one of the most popular Python frameworks for small apps, APIs, and data science dashboards. \nIt is a lightweight, unopinionated web framework that gives you full control over application architecture. Flask is classified as a “microframework” because it doesn’t enforce any particular project structure or include built-in tools like ORM or form validation.\nInstead, it provides a simple core and lets you add only what you need. Flask is built on top of Werkzeug (a WSGI utility library) and Jinja2 (a templating engine). It’s known for its clean syntax, intuitive routing, and flexibility.\nIt scales well when paired with extensions like SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, or Flask-RESTful. \nFlask advantages\nLightweight and flexible: Flask doesn’t impose structure or dependencies, making it ideal for microservices, APIs, and teams that want to build a stack from the ground up.\nPopular for data science and ML workflows: Flask is frequently used for experimentation like building dashboards, serving models, or turning notebooks into lightweight web apps.\nBeginner-friendly: With minimal setup and a gentle learning curve, Flask is often recommended as a first web framework for Python developers.\nExtensible: A rich ecosystem of extensions allows you to add features like database integration, form validation, and authentication only when needed.\nModular architecture: Flask’s design makes it easy to break your app into blueprints or integrate with other services, which is perfect for teams working on distributed systems.\nReadable codebase: Flask’s source code is compact and approachable, making it easier to debug, customize, or fork for internal tooling.\nFlask disadvantages\nBring-your-own everything: Unlike Django, Flask doesn’t include an ORM, admin panel, or user management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these yourself.\nDIY security: Flask provides minimal built-in protections, so you implement CSRF protection, input validation, and other best practices manually.\nPotential to become messy: Without conventions or structure, large Flask apps can become difficult to maintain unless you enforce your own architecture and patterns.\n4. Requests\n2024 usage: 33% (+3% from 2023)\nRequests isn’t a web framework, it’s a Python library for making HTTP requests, but its influence on the Python ecosystem is hard to overstate. It’s one of the most downloaded packages on PyPI and is used in everything from web scraping scripts to production-grade microservices.\nRequests is often paired with frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to handle outbound HTTP calls. It abstracts away the complexity of raw sockets and urllib, offering a clean, Pythonic interface for sending and receiving data over the web.\nRequests advantages\nSimple and intuitive: Requests makes HTTP feel like a native part of Python. Its syntax is clean and readable – requests.get(url) is all it takes to fetch a resource.\nMature and stable: With over a decade of development, Requests is battle-tested and widely trusted. It’s used by millions of developers and is a default dependency in many Python projects.\nGreat for REST clients: Requests is ideal for consuming APIs, integrating with SaaS platforms, or building internal tools that rely on external data sources.\nExcellent documentation and community: The official docs are clear and concise, and the library is well-supported by tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and GitHub issues.\nBroad compatibility: Requests works seamlessly across Python versions and platforms, with built-in support for sessions, cookies, headers, and timeouts.\nRequests disadvantages\nNot async: Requests is synchronous and blocking by design. For high-concurrency workloads or async-native frameworks, alternatives like HTTPX or AIOHTTP are better.\nNo built-in retry logic: While it supports connection pooling and timeouts, retry behavior must be implemented manually or via third-party wrappers like urllib3.\nLimited low-level control: Requests simplifies HTTP calls but abstracts networking details, making advanced tuning (e.g. sockets, DNS, and connection reuse) difficult.\n5. Asyncio\n2024 usage: 23% (+3% from 2023\nAsyncio is Python’s native library for asynchronous programming. It underpins many modern async frameworks and enables developers to write non-blocking code using coroutines, event loops, and async/await syntax.\nWhile not a web framework itself, Asyncio excels at handling I/O-bound tasks such as network requests and subprocesses. It’s often used behind the scenes, but remains a powerful tool for building custom async workflows or integrating with low-level protocols.\nAsyncio advantages\nNative async support: Asyncio is part of the Python standard library and provides first-class support for asynchronous I/O using async/await syntax.\nFoundation for modern frameworks: It powers many of today’s most popular async web frameworks, including FastAPI, Starlette, and AIOHTTP.\nFine-grained control: Developers can manage event loops, schedule coroutines, and coordinate concurrent tasks with precision, which is ideal for building custom async systems.\nEfficient for I/O-bound workloads: Asyncio excels at handling large volumes of concurrent I/O operations, such as API calls, socket connections, or file reads.\nAsyncio disadvantages\nSteep learning curve: Concepts like coroutines, event loops, and task scheduling can be difficult for developers new to asynchronous programming.\nNot a full framework: Asyncio doesn’t provide routing, templating, or request handling. It’s a low-level tool that requires additional libraries for web development.\nDebugging complexity: Async code can be harder to trace and debug, especially when dealing with race conditions or nested coroutines.\n6. Django REST Framework\n2024 usage: 20% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango REST Framework (DRF) is the most widely used extension for building APIs on top of Django. It provides a powerful, flexible toolkit for serializing data, managing permissions, and exposing RESTful endpoints – all while staying tightly integrated with Django’s core components.\nDRF is especially popular in enterprise and backend-heavy applications where teams are already using Django and want to expose a clean, scalable API without switching stacks. It’s also known for its browsable API interface, which makes testing and debugging endpoints much easier during development.\nDjango REST Framework advantages\nDeep Django integration: DRF builds directly on Django’s models, views, and authentication system, making it a natural fit for teams already using Django.\nBrowsable API interface: One of DRF’s key features is its interactive web-based API explorer, which helps developers and testers inspect endpoints without needing external tools.\nFlexible serialization: DRF’s serializers can handle everything from simple fields to deeply nested relationships, and they support both ORM and non-ORM data sources.\nRobust permissions system: DRF includes built-in support for role-based access control, object-level permissions, and custom authorization logic.\nExtensive documentation: DRF is well-documented and widely taught, with a large community and plenty of tutorials, examples, and third-party packages.\nDjango REST Framework disadvantages\nDjango-dependent with heavier setup: DRF is tightly tied to Django and requires more configuration than lightweight frameworks like FastAPI, especially when customizing behavior.\nLess flexible serialization: DRF’s serializers work well for common cases, but customizing them for complex or non-standard data often demands verbose overrides.\nBest of the rest: Frameworks 7–10\nWhile the most popular Python frameworks dominate usage across the ecosystem, several others continue to thrive in more specialized domains. These tools may not rank as high overall, but they play important roles in backend services, data pipelines, and async systems.\n\nFrameworkOverviewAdvantagesDisadvantages\nhttpx\n2024 usage: 15% (+3% from 2023)Modern HTTP client for sync and async workflowsAsync support, HTTP/2, retries, and type hintsNot a web framework, no routing or server-side features\naiohttp\n2024 usage: 13% (+1% from 2023)Async toolkit for HTTP servers and clientsASGI-ready, native WebSocket handling, and flexible middlewareLower-level than FastAPI, less structured for large apps.\nStreamlit\n2024 usage: 12% (+4% from 2023)Dashboard and data app builder for data workflowsFast UI prototyping, with zero front-end knowledge requiredLimited control over layout, less suited for complex UIs.\nStarlette\n2024 usage: 8% (+2% from 2023)Lightweight ASGI framework used by FastAPIExceptional performance, composable design, fine-grained routingRequires manual integration, fewer built-in conveniences\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right framework and tools\nWhether you’re building a blazing-fast API with FastAPI, a full-stack CMS with Django, or a lightweight dashboard with Flask, the most popular Python web frameworks offer solutions for every use case and developer style.\nInsights from the State of Python 2025 show that while Django and Flask remain strong, FastAPI is leading a new wave of async-native, type-safe development. Meanwhile, tools like Requests, Asyncio, and Django REST Framework continue to shape how Python developers build and scale modern web services.\nBut frameworks are only part of the equation. The right development environment can make all the difference, from faster debugging to smarter code completion and seamless framework integration.\nThat’s where PyCharm comes in. Whether you’re working with Django, FastAPI, Flask, or all three, PyCharm offers deep support for Python web development. This includes async debugging, REST client tools, and rich integration with popular libraries and frameworks.\nReady to build something great?

This is a case of “just because you could doesn’t mean you should”.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! This newsletter is the home for recent .NET and software development related information.\n🌟 Featured Content\nThis month’s featured content is from Chris Woodruff! Chris has been at the forefront of software development since before the first .COM boom, building a career that spans enterprise web development, cloud solutions, software analytics, and developer relations. As an Architect, he applies his deep technical expertise to tackle complex challenges, with a particular focus on API design and scalable architectures. He is recognized as a Microsoft MVP specializing in .NET and Web Development. Woody’s impact extends beyond his professional responsibilities; he is a dedicated mentor and educator, teaching courses that help individuals transition into tech careers. His passion for sharing knowledge has made him a sought-after speaker at international conferences, where he discusses topics such as database development, web APIs, and software architecture. He contributes to the developer community by co-hosting The Breakpoint Show podcast and creating content that aids engineers in refining their skills.\nEntity Framework Core (EF Core) has emerged as the preferred Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for modern .NET developers. However, effectively utilizing it requires more than just familiarity with methods like .Add() and .SaveChanges(). This concise newsletter summarizes the essential insights from a full-day EF Core workshop (contact Woody for details below if interested), equipping you with the knowledge necessary to build fast, secure, and scalable data access layers.\nGetting Started with EF Core\nEF Core is a lightweight, extensible, and high-performance data access framework. It supports a clean code-first approach while allowing database-first flexibility when needed.\nKey Concepts:\n✅ DbContext is your gateway to the database. It manages connections change tracking, and query execution.\n✅ Use DbSet<T> to represent your entity collections.\n✅ Code-First is ideal for domain-driven development; use Fluent API to fine-tune schema mappings.\n💡Pro Tip: Always register your DbContext as Scoped. Avoid Singleton lifetimes to prevent memory issues and concurrency errors.\nModeling Relationships Like a Pro\nEF Core handles common relationship types easily, but it’s up to you to configure them correctly.\nModeling Must-Knows:\n✅ Define one-to-many with .HasMany().WithOne()\n✅ Use explicit foreign keys in your model for clarity.\n✅ Prefer eager loading (.Include()) for web APIs to avoid runtime surprises.\n💡Pro Tip: Don’t rely on lazy loading in APIs. It hides performance issues and can cause excessive database queries.\nQuerying with Power and Precision\nLINQ is a powerful abstraction, but be intentional.\nPerformance-First Query Tips:\n✅ Use .Select() to shape the result into DTOs, avoid sending entire entities.\n✅ Apply .AsNoTracking() for read-only queries to reduce memory use.\n✅ Chain .Where() and .OrderBy() before projection to reduce query size.\n💡Pro Tip: Avoid over-fetching by skipping unnecessary .Include() chains. Smaller queries are faster queries.\nSQL Server: Tune What EF Core Generates\nYou’re still writing SQL, it’s just hidden behind LINQ.\nSQL Server Optimization: \n✅ Use SSMS to inspect EF-generated SQL.\n✅ Read execution plans to diagnose slow queries.\n✅ Tune indexes based on frequent query filters or sorts.\n✅ Leverage Query Store to monitor historical query behavior\n💡Pro Tip: Computed columns and filtered indexes can supercharge performance when used intentionally.\nSecure Your Data Layer\nEF Core doesn’t protect you from bad design. Data security must be implemented in your access layer.\nSecurity Strategies:\n✅ Use DTOs to prevent overposting.\n✅ Filter by user role or claim inside the query, not afterward.\n✅ Never interpolate raw SQL, always parameterize inputs.\n✅ Store secrets securely: Use User Secrets in dev, Managed Identity in Azure.\n💡Pro Tip: Your DbContext is an attack surface. Secure it like you would any API.\nTesting EF Core with Confidence\nTesting EF Core doesn’t have to be painful, use the right tools.\nApproach by Test Type:\n✅ Use In-Memory provider for fast unit tests, but be aware it behaves differently from SQL Server.\n✅ Prefer SQLite in-memory for a closer match to production.\n✅ Use Testcontainers or local SQL Server for full integration testing.\n💡Pro Tip: Seed data should be scenario-specific and reset between tests. Use Respawn or EF-based seeding for consistency.\nScaling for the Cloud\nCloud-readiness means EF Core must handle concurrency, resiliency, and high throughput.\nCloud-Ready Practices:\n✅ Use DbContextPool for high-performance APIs.\n✅ Configure retry logic with EnableRetryOnFailure(), and even better, learn and use Polly, which is a library for .NET designed for resilience and transient-fault handling. It enables developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent, thread-safe manner.\n✅ Apply distributed caching at the service layer, not the EF level.\n✅ Use sharded/multi-tenant strategies carefully: filtered queries, schema separation, or even DB-per-tenant.\n💡Pro Tip: Azure SQL + EF Core is a battle-tested combo, just don’t forget to tune your retry strategies and monitor connection health.\nCommon Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\nEven experienced developers can fall into subtle traps when working with EF Core. Here are some of the most common mistakes, and how to dodge them in your projects.\n❌ Lazy Loading in APIs\nLazy loading can cause unexpected multiple queries per request. In web APIs, it often results in the dreaded N+1 problem.\n✅ Use Eager Loading or Projections\nExplicitly load related data with .Include() or shape the query using .Select() and DTOs.\n❌ Leaking Entities to the Client\nExposing EF entities directly in your controllers or UI tightly couples your domain to your database schema.\n✅ Use DTOs or ViewModels\nMap to dedicated types that represent what the consumer needs. Nothing more, nothing less.\n❌ Overusing .Include() Chains\nDeep includes may look convenient, but can result in massive SQL joins and redundant data loading.\n✅ Load Only What You Need\nBe intentional. Use shaped queries and projections for complex object graphs.\n❌ Ignoring Execution Plans and SQL Output\nIf you’re not inspecting the SQL your LINQ generates, you’re flying blind.\n✅ Use SSMS and Query Store\nAlways review generated SQL for critical paths. Use SQL Server tooling to optimize indexes and execution plans.\nReady to Go Deeper?\n👉 Explore Chris’s GitHub repo with all of his EF Core demos. \n🗣️ Need help applying this in production or want to discuss the workshop? Book some time or have a code review with Chris. \n🔗 Links\nHere’s the latest from the developer community.\nTechnical Coaching: From One Team to Many Teams 🎥 – Emily Bache\nWhy Most .NET Developers Don’t Need MediatR 🎥 – Gui Ferreira\n2code ^ !2code [S2025E11] Multi-targeting Roslyn Components – Part 1 🎥 – FlashOWare by Eva Ditzelmüller & Stefan Pölz\nThe #1 Reason Your Software System Gets Messy 🎥 – CodeOpinion by Derek Comartin \nSteve Smith on How Generative AI is the New Offshoring 🎥- Technology and Friends by David Giard\nStop Wasting Time: Use the 70/20/10 Rule to grow as a developer 🎙️ – Andrea Angella\nConverting an xUnit test project to TUnit – Andrew Lock\nImplementing BFF Pattern in ASP.NET Core for SPAs and BFF in ASP.NET Core #7 – Introducing the Duende BFF Library – Tore Nestenius\nExploring .NET MAUI: Popups, Messages, and Data Validation – Paul Sheriff\nMastering Incremental Source Generators in C#: A Complete Guide with Example – Ali Hamza Ansari\nCreating Trusted Document Containers with PDF/A-3b in .NET C# – Bjoern Meyer\nHow I Reduced API Response Time by 70% in a Large .NET Project – Ali Hamza Ansari\nEntity Framework or Dapper: which one is better for .NET/C#? – Denis Makarenko\nOptimizing ASP.NET Core Web Site Performance – Duende’s Need for Speed – Khalid Abuhakmeh\nHow to Apply SOLID Principles in AI Development Using Prompt Engineering – Jeyasri Murugan\n🔦 From our .NET Guide\nEach month we feature tutorials or tips from our .NET Guide.\nAzure Functions\nDeveloping and managing cloud solutions often requires a seamless and efficient workflow.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hold on to your helper methods – RubyMine is now FREE for non-commercial use! Whether you’re learning Ruby and Rails, pushing open-source forward, creating dev content, or building your passion project, we want to make sure you have the tools to enjoy what you do even more… for free.\nGet RubyMine for free\n                                                    \nAnother chapter in the story\nWe recently introduced a new licensing model for WebStorm, RustRover, Rider, and CLion – making them free for non-commercial use. RubyMine is now joining the party! For commercial use, our existing licensing model still applies.\nWhy are we doing this?\nWe believe developers do their best work when the right tools are accessible. We’ve been listening closely to the Ruby and Rails community – their feedback, success, challenges, and passion for building with joy. Now, we’re making a change that reflects what we’ve heard.\nBy making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, we hope to lower the barrier to starting and help more people write clean, confident Ruby code from day one. It’s our way of supporting the unique Ruby community – from those who choose Ruby for their projects to maintainers of gems and frameworks who contribute to the Ruby ecosystem. Whether you’re debugging at midnight, crafting clever DSLs, or launching your first Rails app, RubyMine is here to help you build smarter (and crash less).\nCommercial vs. non-commercial use\nAs defined in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, commercial use means developing products and earning commercial benefits from your activities. However, certain categories are explicitly excluded from this definition. Common examples of non-commercial uses include learning and self-education, open-source contributions without earning commercial benefits, any form of content creation, and hobby development.\nIt’s important to note that, if you’re using a non-commercial license, you cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics. We use this information to improve our products. The data we collect is exclusively that of anonymous feature usages of our IDEs. It is focused on what actions are performed and what types of functionality of the IDE are used. We do not collect any other data. This is similar to our Early Access Program (EAP) and is in compliance with our Privacy Policy.\nFAQ\nBelow are answers to the most common questions. Check out the full FAQ for more information.\nLicensing\nWhat features are included under the free license?\nWith the new non-commercial license type, you can enjoy a full-featured IDE that is identical to its paid version. The only difference is in the Code With Me feature – you get Code With Me Community with your free license.\nWhich license should I choose if I want to use RubyMine for both non-commercial and commercial projects?\nIf you intend to use RubyMine for commercial development for which you will receive direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation within the meaning of the definitions provided in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, you will need to purchase a commercial subscription (either individual or organizational). This license can then also be used for non-commercial development.\nHow do renewals and upgrades work now?\nNon-commercial subscriptions are issued for one year and will automatically renew after that. However, for the renewal to happen, you must have used the assigned license at least once during the last 6 months of the subscription period. If it has been more than 6 months since you last used an IDE activated with this type of license and the renewal did not occur automatically, you can request a new non-commercial subscription again at any time.\nAm I eligible for a refund if I’ve already bought a paid subscription but do non-commercial development?\nIf you’re unsure whether you qualify for a refund, you’ll find full details of our policy here. Please note that if you also work on projects that qualify as commercial usage, you can’t use the free license for them.\nAnonymous data collection \nDoes my IDE send any data to JetBrains?\nThe terms of the non-commercial agreement assume that the product may also electronically send JetBrains anonymized statistics (IDE telemetry) related to your usage of the product’s features. This information may include but is not limited to frameworks, file templates used in the product, actions invoked, and other interactions with the product’s features. This information does not contain personal data.\nIs there a way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics?\nWe appreciate that this might not be convenient for everyone, but there is unfortunately no way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics to JetBrains under the terms of the Toolbox agreement for non-commercial use. The only way to opt out is by switching to either a paid subscription or one of the complimentary options mentioned here.\nGetting a non-commercial subscription \nWhat should I do to apply for this subscription? \nIt can be easily done right inside your IDE:\nInstall RubyMine and run it.\nUpon startup, there will be a license dialog box where you can choose the Non-commercial use option.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nIf you’ve already started a trial period or have activated your IDE using a paid license, you still can switch to a non-commercial subscription by following these steps:\nGo to Help | Register.\nIn the window that opens, click on the Deactivate License button.\nChoose Non-commercial use.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nI don’t see the Non-commercial use option in my IDE. What should I do? \nThe most likely explanation for this is that you’re using an older version of RubyMine. Unfortunately, we don’t support obtaining the non-commercial license for any releases prior to RubyMine 2025.2.1.\nThat’s it for today! If you don’t find an answer to your question, feel free to leave a comment or contact us at sales@jetbrains.com.\nThe RubyMine team\nJetBrains\nMake it happen. With code.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Picture this: You’re working on your MSc thesis as an intern in software engineering, not just as an academic exercise, but side-by-side with an industry team, tackling real projects and real problems, refining code, and witnessing your ideas come alive. By the time you’ve graduated, you’re already a valued team member, ready to hit the ground running . \nIn a short series of posts, we will tell you about four recent graduates who have done exactly that, thanks to our AI for Software Engineering ( AI4SE ) research partnership with Delft University of Technology ( TU Delft ). Having recently completed their MSc thesis work as interns here at JetBrains, they are now starting full-time positions with us. \nThis first post will tell you a little about them and their experiences at JetBrains so far, and the second will go deeper into their new roles.\nIncoming AI4SE graduates to JetBrains \nWhile working on their MSc theses, these students got hands-on experience in the tech world. And now they’re full-time innovators sharing how their internships became the launchpad for their careers. Here are Milan, Nadine, Saga, and Sergey:\n\nMilan de Koning, Nadine Kuo, Saga Rut Sunnevudóttir, and Sergey Datskiv\nDuring their time as interns with us, they worked on projects covering various topics and contributed important research. For many of them, their work will grow into journal papers in the coming months. \nOur AI4SE Partnership\nThe AI4SE program merges academic research with industry collaboration. Together with our partners at TU Delft, we are committed to advancing cutting-edge research on the impact and utilization of AI methodologies in software engineering, focusing on areas such as software development, testing, and programming education.\nAI4SE was launched in 2023, and each year four to five students work together with researchers on topics within the five research tracks (more details on who is involved can be found on the AI4SE People  page). Several of our teams participate: Software Testing Research, HAX, Dynamic Program Analysis, Education Research teams; alongside teams from the TU Delft side: AISE and CISE research labs from the Software Engineering Research Group and the Center of Education and Learning . The program additionally is part of the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence (ICAI).\nWhat it’s like to be an AI4SE intern at JetBrains\nOverall, the interns enjoyed the same status as full-fledged employees, with the encouragement to ask questions and present their own ideas. The environment is intellectually stimulating and the company culture is very supportive.\n\n\n\n\n\nAI4SE students’ research topics\nThis cohort researched topics from different AI4SE tracks and worked with various JetBrains departments. \n“The opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology is something that I am very grateful for.”\n\n            \nMilan\n                                                        \nHere are more details on their thesis work:\nMilan’s thesis looked at data leakage, or when a model sees parts of the test data during training. For the thesis, he:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research team.\nUsed metamorphic testing, which changes code without altering its meaning, to reveal when models rely on memorization rather than true understanding.\nStudied how this can lead to inflated results in automated bug-fixing systems.\nNadine’s thesis involved designing and evaluating a proactive AI assistant in enterprise integrated development environments (IDEs), to supplement earlier related work confined to controlled laboratory settings. For the thesis, she:\nWorked within Track 3 and with our Human-AI eXperience (HAX) and Fleet teams.\nDeveloped a system that proactively suggests code improvements via in-editor cues and the AI Chat, based on heuristics for help-seeking moments. \nEvaluated the final design with an in-the-wild study, engaging professional developers to understand how timing, representation, and context influence user experience and perceptions.\nSaga’s thesis focused on evaluating the current status of state-of-the-art test generation tools for JavaScript and TypeScript. For the thesis, she:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research and  WebStorm teams. \nBuilt a benchmark for assessing these tools, specifically JetBrains AI Assistant.\nSergey’s thesis concerned improving the current state-of-the-art unit test-case generation approach with LLMs. For the thesis, he:\nWorked within Track 1 and with the Software Testing Research team.\nStudied the possible challenges and benefits of using LLMs for test case generation and integration into existing tools.\nTips for incoming students\n“ It was inspiring to connect with like-minded peers who were also passionate about the future of AI in software engineering.”\n\n            \nNadine\n                                                        \nStarting an internship at a new company might be daunting. Here, our graduates share some tips for future interns on how to get the most out of their experience:\n\n\n\n\nFrom what we’ve seen so far, it’s clear that our graduates’ willingness to learn, ask questions, and jump right into challenging projects has created a rich experience both for them and for us. We look forward to sharing more about their experiences as they continue to grow with us. Stay tuned for Part II!\nIf you are a TU Delft student interested in joining AI4SE, contact Mitchell Olsthoorn for general questions about the thesis procedures, or reach out to the university track leads to learn about project opportunities.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The way developers create plugins implementing the Language Server Protocol (LSP) in JetBrains IDEs is undergoing a significant shift. With PyCharm and IntelliJ IDEA adopting a unified distribution model, we’re removing a key obstacle that has been limiting LSP adoption within the IntelliJ Platform ecosystem. Starting with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.2, users can continue using a limited set of features, including the LSP API, even after their subscription expires. Community Edition (CE) will still be available in 2025.2 but will not include LSP support. See our other announcement to learn more.\nKey changes in LSP availability\nThe most important update affects how LSP functionality is distributed in JetBrains IDEs:\nImmediate impact (2025.2): The LSP API, which is already available to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate users, will now be accessible for free within a limited feature set when their subscription expires. This change addresses long-standing feedback from plugin developers and smaller language communities, ensuring users no longer need to consider licensing restrictions when choosing between platforms.\nFuture changes (2025.3): With the new unified distribution, the traditional Community Edition will be sunset. All users will download a single IntelliJ IDEA installer, with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate features requiring a subscription to be unlocked, but LSP support will remain available to everyone.\nThe LSP implementation itself stays closed-source and commercial, but we’ll keep it fully accessible for third-party plugins at no charge. This means plugin developers can now target a much broader user base without requiring their users to purchase the IntelliJ IDEA license.\nWhat does this mean for plugin developers \nThis change addresses one of the most persistent complaints from the developer community. Previously, plugins using the LSP were essentially limited to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate users, creating a significant barrier for:\nOpen-source plugin developers who wanted to provide LSP-based language support without restricting their user base.\nNiche language communities, where requiring a paid subscription made adoption impractical, especially for small teams or individual contributors.\nEducational environments, where managing different IDE editions added unnecessary complexity and friction.\nThe unified approach means plugin developers can now:\nBuild LSP-based plugins that work for users of all JetBrains IDEs.\nReduce the complexity of explaining installation requirements to users.\nCompete more effectively with competitors’ extensions, which have had universal LSP support.\nCurrent LSP capabilities and setup\nThe LSP API in the IntelliJ Platform has matured significantly since its introduction in 2023.2 and currently supports the following:\nCore language features:\nCode completion with resolve support\nGo to definition and type definition\nHover documentation\nFind references definition\nSemantic highlighting\nDiagnostics (both push and pull models)\nAdvanced features:\nCode actions and quick-fixes\nDocument formatting\nDocument links and color preview\nIntention actions\nWorkspace commands\nPlugin developers should target IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.2.1+ and include the optional dependency on the com.intellij.modules.lsp module in the plugin.xml file.\n<idea-plugin>\n  <depends optional=”true” config-file=\"lsp.xml\">com.intellij.modules.lsp</depends>\n</idea-plugin>\nTo ensure the plugin is only available for installation in 2025.2.1+ and later, specify the since-build property in your build.gradle.kts file with:\nintellijPlatform {\n    pluginConfiguration {\n        ideaVersion {\n            sinceBuild = \"252.25557\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nIf your project is based on the Plugin Template, set the relevant build number in the gradle.properties file:\npluginSinceBuild=252.25557\nTo integrate the Kotlin LSP, two components are needed:\nAn LSP server descriptor that specifies supported files and offers a command line to launch the server as a standalone process.\nAn LSP support provider that ensures the server is accessible for a given file.\nServer Descriptor\nThe following KotlinLspServerDescriptor creates an LSP support provider for the Language Server for Kotlin that handles Kotlin files (.kt extension). The provider will ensure that the language server runs in a separate process from the kotlin-lsp binary available in the PATH environment variable.\nprivate class KotlinLspServerDescriptor(project: Project)\n    : ProjectWideLspServerDescriptor(project, \"KN Kotlin LSP\") {\n\n    override fun isSupportedFile(file: VirtualFile) =\n        file.extension == \"kt\"\n\n    override fun createCommandLine() =\n        GeneralCommandLine(\"kotlin-lsp\", \"--stdio\")\n}\nLSP Support Provider\nCreate an LSP support provider that initiates the LSP server when needed, using the appropriate server descriptor.\nclass KotlinLspServerSupportProvider : LspServerSupportProvider {\n\n    override fun fileOpened(\n        project: Project,\n        file: VirtualFile,\n        serverStarter: LspServerSupportProvider.LspServerStarter,\n    ) {\n        if (file.extension == \"kt\") {\n            serverStarter.ensureServerStarted(\n                KotlinLspServerDescriptor(project)\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe LSP support provider must be registered in the plugin descriptor, next to the main plugin.xml, within the existing lsp.xml file.\n<idea-plugin>\n  <extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <platform.lsp.serverSupportProvider\n      implementation=\"com.example.KotlinLspServerSupportProvider\"/>\n  </extensions>\n</idea-plugin>\nYou can find the above LSP implementation as a Kotlin Notebook example here: https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-notebook-intellij-platform/blob/master/examples/lsp.ipynb\nTrade-offs\nThe IntelliJ Platform documentation is clear about positioning: The LSP approach shouldn’t be considered as a replacement for the existing language API but rather as an added value. While LSP development offers significant advantages, such as reduced maintenance effort, faster development cycles, and cross-platform consistency, it is important to keep the following limitations in mind:\nLimited IDE integration: The LSP approach provides less access to the IntelliJ Platform’s robust native features, which are deeply integrated via the Program Structure Interface (PSI).\nPerformance considerations: Using an LSP-based plugin introduces communication overhead compared to native implementations.\nFeature parity gaps: Some advanced IDE features may not currently have LSP equivalents, limiting the scope for certain plugin developers.\nThe LSP serves as a practical, lightweight solution for plugin developers seeking to reduce complexity and expand their reach while delivering consistent language support. For those who need deeper integration with IntelliJ Platform features, native APIs like the PSI remain the preferred choice.\nGetting started with LSP development\nTo explore LSP integration, plugin developers should:\nReview the comprehensive documentation available in the IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK.\nExamine existing implementations like the open-source Prisma ORM plugin.\nStart with basic features and gradually add more sophisticated capabilities.\nPlan for the 2025.2 release to leverage universal LSP support.\nWrapping up and looking ahead\nRemoving commercial licensing for LSP integration on the IntelliJ Platform eliminates a significant problem for plugin developers, allowing them to prioritize efficiency and feature work.\nMore importantly, this shift represents more than a purely technical change; it underscores JetBrains’ recognition that language server development should be accessible to the broader developer community, not just those building commercial products.\nWhile LSP integration won’t replace every native API, it provides a practical, lightweight solution for delivering consistent language support across all JetBrains IDEs. This fosters competition and presents an opportunity for plugin creators to target a broader audience. With the 2025.2 release, plugin authors can now evaluate and adopt the LSP on its technical merits, free from licensing constraints.",

Hilt는 수동으로 구성하던 많은 코드를 자동으로 만드는데 이 역할은 Android Studio의 플러그인이 해주고 있다. 다만 빌드 시간이 늘어날 수밖에 없다.(사실 Dagger일 때 1-2분이었지만 3분 이상으로 늘기도 했다)</p>\n\n<h2>수많은 모듈</h2>\n\n<p>수많은 모듈에서는 당연하지만 결국 모듈의 관리가 가장 중요하다.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thdev.tech/android/2024/10/20/Android-dependency-manage/\">Android에서 효율적인 모듈 디펜던시 관리하기, build-logic으로 전환하기?</a></p>\n\n<p>build-logic을 사용하는 것은 어찌 보면 필수이다. 최소한의 코드를 사용하여 build.gradle.kts를 관리하여야 한다.</p>\n\n<p>그리고 필자는 사실상 App 모듈을 수정하지 않는 것을 선호한다. 사실 만들고 나면 고칠 일은 거의 없다. 모두 피처 모듈의 형태를 띠고 있으니 더더욱 수정할 일은 없다.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 implementation은 어떻게 하는가? 위 글에도 나오긴 하지만 이제 저 방식으로도 힘들다.</p>\n\n<p>그래서 수정한 코드 방식은 아래와 같다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nf\">dependencies</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">rootProject</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">subprojects</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nf\">filterProject</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nf\">implementation</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">it</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>필터는 왜 필요한가? 모든 모듈이 하위에 바로 위치하는 것은 아니다. :폴더:폴더:모듈 의 형태를 가지는 경우가 더 흔하다. 그래서 filter를 통해 구분한다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">fun</span> <span class=\"nf\">Set</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"nc\">Project</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;.</span><span class=\"nf\">filterProject</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"n\">body</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">target</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"nc\">Project</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span> <span class=\"nc\">Unit</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nf\">forEach</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"n\">project</span> <span class=\"p\">-&gt;</span>\n        <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">name</span> <span class=\"p\">!=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"app\"</span> <span class=\"p\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">buildFile</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">isFile</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n            <span class=\"nf\">body</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">project</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n        <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>사실상 위에서부터 순서대로 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">settings.gradle.kts</code>에 정의한 모든 모듈을 참조하기에 app 모듈이 아닌 경우를 구분해야 한다.</p>\n\n<p>어찌 보면 단점이다. 기존엔 그냥 특정 모듈을 바로 공통으로 접근할 수 있었는데, 그렇지 않아서 수정한 상태다.</p>\n\n<h2>레거시 ViewModel에서 AAC-ViewModel로</h2>\n\n<p>AAC-ViewModel을 사용하지 않았다. 이유는 굳이 써야 할 이유가 없었다.</p>\n\n<p>하지만 안드로이드 16이 나오면서 이제 AAC-ViewModel을 꼭 사용하긴 해야 한다. 그렇지 않다면 데이터 savedstate를 처리해 주어야 한다. 안드로이드 16부터는 폴더블 기기 600dp 부터 화면 회전이 강제화된다. 회전을 막는다고 하더라도 무시되고 동작한다.</p>\n\n<p>예외를 하면 회전했을 때 좌우에 여백을 공백으로 만들 뿐 회전을 막는 것 역시 아니다. 근데 최근에 이거 안 쓰는 개발자가 있을까 싶다.</p>\n\n<h2>iOS TCA</h2>\n\n<p>TCA를 처음부터 한 것은 아니고 중간부터 투입되어 개발하게 되었다.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thdev.tech/tca/2025/01/04/iOS-TCA/\">안드로이드 개발자가 본 iOS TCA 살펴보기</a></p>\n\n<p>TCA는 리덕스로 작성되어 있다. 다행히도 안드로이드 개발에서 사용하던 플로우 이벤트 처리 방식을 그대로 이어가면서 개발이 가능하였다는 점이다. 적응하는 시간은 오래 걸렸다. 일반적으로 UiState를 리턴하는 리액트 방식과는 다르게 다음 액션을 전달하는 방식의 차이가 있다. 그래서 이후 안드로이드 아키텍처를 만들면서 소개한 내용과 이어진다.(블로그 글 참고)</p>\n\n<p>10개월이라는 짧은 기간 동안 TCA를 사용해보면서 느낀 점은 딱 하나. 오류 위치를 알려주지 않는다. 의외로 해결법은 간단한데, 코드를 분리해야 한다. 코드를 분리한다고 하여도 오류를 잘 알려주는 것은 아니다.</p>\n\n<p>그냥 어딘가 문법 오류가 있다. 끝. 일일이 주석 처리해 가면서 찾아야 한다. 다행히 런타임 오류가 아닌 것이 어디인가 싶다.</p>\n\n<p>그리고 또 하나 경험한 내용은 앱의 이름 덕분에 앱이 그냥 종료되어지는 오류도 만나보았다. 특정 버전의 OS에서만 오류가 발생하였다. 의심 가는 걸 Gemini와 GPT 둘 다에게 질문했지만 찾지 못했다. 결국 감으로 찾은 이유는 앱 이름이 겹쳐서였다는 사실이다.</p>\n\n<p>앱이 그냥 아무 이유 없이 꺼지는데 분석을 자세히 해보면 더 빨리 찾았겠지만 iOS 경험이 많지 않은 상태에서 AI가 없었다면 며칠 걸렸을지도 모르지만 다행히 하루 만에 이유를 찾고 해결해보았다.</p>\n\n<h2>결국</h2>\n\n<p>결국 요구사항을 잘 반영하는 코드를 만들고 싶은 욕심과 AI를 더 잘 활용하는 방법 등이 있다.</p>\n\n<p>TCA를 하면서 한 가지 느낀 점은 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">굳이 Data 모듈도 나누어야 할까?</code> 라는 의문이다. 자동화를 통해 Data 모듈도 KSP로 JSON 통신하는 것을 만들고, 이것을 API 정의한 것에 연동하는 과정을 만들면 더 쉬운 개발도 가능하다는 점이다.</p>\n\n<p>그런 관점에서 이전에 작성한 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">도메인 관련 글의 인사이트를 다시 얻게 되었다.</code></p>\n\n<h2>마무리</h2>\n\n<p>약 4년 동안 입력한 코드 양만 합산 316만 줄이다. 여기에는 자동으로 생성되어지는 json이나 파일들이 있을 거니 이런 걸 제외하더라도 300만 줄의 코드를 쳤다는 것이긴 하다. 단순히 파일 이동도 있으니 더 제외하면 더 줄어들겠지만.</p>\n\n<p>코드양이 많다고 많은 걸 해본 것도 아니다. 그냥 즐겁게 코드를 입력하고, 이해하기 위해서 기존의 코드를 가져와 그대로 사용하지 않고 직접 입력하면서 이해하는 것을 우선하려고 노력하였다. 다행히 이를 통해 더 많은 코드를 수정하고 반영할 수 있었다.</p>\n\n<p>다만 누구나 이 코드를 수정할 수 있는가?

UiState를 활용해 데이터를 처리하도록 만들었고, 이때 @Immutable, @Stable을 붙여 사용하였다.\n\n@Immutable\ndata class SomeUiState(\n    val items: ImmutableList<String>,\n    val showProgress: Boolean,\n    val showPlaceholder: Boolean,\n) {\n\n    companion object {\n        \n        val Default = SomeUiState(\n            items = persistentListOf(),\n            showProgress = false,\n            showPlaceholder = false,\n        )\n\n        val Placeholder = Default.copy(\n            showPlaceholder = true,\n            items = persistentListOf(\"a\", \"b\"),\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\n위와 같은 형태이다. 리컴포지션을 중요하게 생각하니 ImmutableList 역시 사용한다.\nCompose는 일반적인 방식이며, Stateful, Stateless를 구분하여 사용하며\nSomeRoute: Navigation에서 불러지는 화면\nSomeScreen: Route에서 불러다 사용하는 내부의 internal fun SomeScreen()\nSomeComponent: Screen을 조합하는 모든 구성 요소는 Component를 활용한다.\n    \n당연하지만 Component는 Stateless 형태로 작성해야 한다. 다만 모듈의 위치에 따라 data class를 전달받기도 한다.\n시나리오 기반 테스트\n모든 ViewModel의 로직은 UnitTest를 포함하는데, 2023 드로이드 나이츠 발표자료에서 일부 소개한 방식을 사용한다.\n아래와 같은 시나리오 기반의 코드가 가능하다.\n사용자가 버튼을 누른다.\n입력값이 있다면 flow를 진행하고, 그렇지 않다면 filter에 걸린다.\nUiState 상 프로그레스를 실행한다.\n동의 화면이(Alert/BottomSheet 등)이 뜨면 응답에 따라 동작이 달라진다.\n    \nYes 진행하고 네트워크 통신을 시작한다.\nNo 진행을 중단하고 프로그레스를 원래 상태로 되돌린다.\n네트워크 응답에 따라\n    \n실패하면 서버에서 내려주는 Alert/Toast 등을 노출하고 프로그레스를 되돌린다.\n성공하면 완료 처리한다.\n위의 모든 단계를 UnitTest에서 테스트하고 버튼의 복구까지 이어지는 UiState의 상태를 확인하는 식으로 개발하였다. 모두 완벽하진 않다. 다만 UiTest를 하지 않아도 UnitTest 만으로 어느 정도 범위에서 안정적인 서비스가 가능하다는 장점을 가진다.\n이런 테스트는 1,000개가 넘게 포함되어 있었다.\nKSP를 활용한 Hilt Module 정의\n메모리상 빠르게 사라질 수 있도록 하려고 Data 모듈에 대한 정의는 Activity 라이프사이클에 따르도록 만들었고, 정말 필요한 경우가 아니라면 싱글턴은 최소한으로 사용하였다.\n이런 부분도 자동화를 하고 싶었고, KSP를 활용해 자동화했다. 기존에는 Dagger를 활용하였는데, Hilt를 사용함으로써 더 간결해졌다.\nKSP를 활용해 Hilt 모듈을 자동으로 생성할 수 있도록 만들어 사용하였는데, Kilt(Kotlin + Hilt)를 별도로 만들어 두었다.\n@KiltGenerateModule을 추가하면 자동으로 Hilt의 @Module을 만들어주는 역할을 한다.\n참고 : Dagger를 사용하면 사실상 빌드 시간이 더 단축된다. Hilt는 수동으로 구성하던 많은 코드를 자동으로 만드는데 이 역할은 Android Studio의 플러그인이 해주고 있다. 다만 빌드 시간이 늘어날 수밖에 없다.(사실 Dagger일 때 1-2분이었지만 3분 이상으로 늘기도 했다)\n수많은 모듈\n수많은 모듈에서는 당연하지만 결국 모듈의 관리가 가장 중요하다.\nAndroid에서 효율적인 모듈 디펜던시 관리하기, build-logic으로 전환하기?\nbuild-logic을 사용하는 것은 어찌 보면 필수이다. 최소한의 코드를 사용하여 build.gradle.kts를 관리하여야 한다.\n그리고 필자는 사실상 App 모듈을 수정하지 않는 것을 선호한다. 사실 만들고 나면 고칠 일은 거의 없다. 모두 피처 모듈의 형태를 띠고 있으니 더더욱 수정할 일은 없다.\n그럼 implementation은 어떻게 하는가? 위 글에도 나오긴 하지만 이제 저 방식으로도 힘들다.\n그래서 수정한 코드 방식은 아래와 같다.\n\ndependencies {\n    rootProject.subprojects.filterProject {\n        implementation(it)\n    }\n}\n\n\n필터는 왜 필요한가? 모든 모듈이 하위에 바로 위치하는 것은 아니다. :폴더:폴더:모듈 의 형태를 가지는 경우가 더 흔하다. 그래서 filter를 통해 구분한다.\n\nfun Set<Project>.filterProject(\n    body: (target: Project) -> Unit,\n) {\n    forEach { project ->\n        if (project.name != \"app\" && project.buildFile.isFile) {\n            body(project)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n사실상 위에서부터 순서대로 settings.gradle.kts에 정의한 모든 모듈을 참조하기에 app 모듈이 아닌 경우를 구분해야 한다.\n어찌 보면 단점이다. 기존엔 그냥 특정 모듈을 바로 공통으로 접근할 수 있었는데, 그렇지 않아서 수정한 상태다.\n레거시 ViewModel에서 AAC-ViewModel로\nAAC-ViewModel을 사용하지 않았다. 이유는 굳이 써야 할 이유가 없었다.\n하지만 안드로이드 16이 나오면서 이제 AAC-ViewModel을 꼭 사용하긴 해야 한다. 그렇지 않다면 데이터 savedstate를 처리해 주어야 한다. 안드로이드 16부터는 폴더블 기기 600dp 부터 화면 회전이 강제화된다. 회전을 막는다고 하더라도 무시되고 동작한다.\n예외를 하면 회전했을 때 좌우에 여백을 공백으로 만들 뿐 회전을 막는 것 역시 아니다. 근데 최근에 이거 안 쓰는 개발자가 있을까 싶다.\niOS TCA\nTCA를 처음부터 한 것은 아니고 중간부터 투입되어 개발하게 되었다.\n안드로이드 개발자가 본 iOS TCA 살펴보기\nTCA는 리덕스로 작성되어 있다. 다행히도 안드로이드 개발에서 사용하던 플로우 이벤트 처리 방식을 그대로 이어가면서 개발이 가능하였다는 점이다. 적응하는 시간은 오래 걸렸다. 일반적으로 UiState를 리턴하는 리액트 방식과는 다르게 다음 액션을 전달하는 방식의 차이가 있다. 그래서 이후 안드로이드 아키텍처를 만들면서 소개한 내용과 이어진다.(블로그 글 참고)\n10개월이라는 짧은 기간 동안 TCA를 사용해보면서 느낀 점은 딱 하나. 오류 위치를 알려주지 않는다. 의외로 해결법은 간단한데, 코드를 분리해야 한다. 코드를 분리한다고 하여도 오류를 잘 알려주는 것은 아니다.\n그냥 어딘가 문법 오류가 있다. 끝. 일일이 주석 처리해 가면서 찾아야 한다. 다행히 런타임 오류가 아닌 것이 어디인가 싶다.\n그리고 또 하나 경험한 내용은 앱의 이름 덕분에 앱이 그냥 종료되어지는 오류도 만나보았다. 특정 버전의 OS에서만 오류가 발생하였다. 의심 가는 걸 Gemini와 GPT 둘 다에게 질문했지만 찾지 못했다. 결국 감으로 찾은 이유는 앱 이름이 겹쳐서였다는 사실이다.\n앱이 그냥 아무 이유 없이 꺼지는데 분석을 자세히 해보면 더 빨리 찾았겠지만 iOS 경험이 많지 않은 상태에서 AI가 없었다면 며칠 걸렸을지도 모르지만 다행히 하루 만에 이유를 찾고 해결해보았다.\n결국\n결국 요구사항을 잘 반영하는 코드를 만들고 싶은 욕심과 AI를 더 잘 활용하는 방법 등이 있다.\nTCA를 하면서 한 가지 느낀 점은 굳이 Data 모듈도 나누어야 할까? 라는 의문이다. 자동화를 통해 Data 모듈도 KSP로 JSON 통신하는 것을 만들고, 이것을 API 정의한 것에 연동하는 과정을 만들면 더 쉬운 개발도 가능하다는 점이다.\n그런 관점에서 이전에 작성한 도메인 관련 글의 인사이트를 다시 얻게 되었다.\n마무리\n약 4년 동안 입력한 코드 양만 합산 316만 줄이다. 여기에는 자동으로 생성되어지는 json이나 파일들이 있을 거니 이런 걸 제외하더라도 300만 줄의 코드를 쳤다는 것이긴 하다. 단순히 파일 이동도 있으니 더 제외하면 더 줄어들겠지만.\n코드양이 많다고 많은 걸 해본 것도 아니다. 그냥 즐겁게 코드를 입력하고, 이해하기 위해서 기존의 코드를 가져와 그대로 사용하지 않고 직접 입력하면서 이해하는 것을 우선하려고 노력하였다. 다행히 이를 통해 더 많은 코드를 수정하고 반영할 수 있었다.\n다만 누구나 이 코드를 수정할 수 있는가? 뷰는 가능하지만 core는 어렵다. 기본적인 이해를 바탕으로 하기에는 프레임워크를 이해해야 하는 것과 같다.",

최근 OpenAI가 GPT-5를 공개하면서 AI 업계는 물론, 우리 일상에도 큰 변화가 찾아왔습니다. 특히 가장 놀라운 소식은 이 강력한 최신 모델이 <b>무료 ChatGPT 사용자에게도 개방</b>되었다는 점인데요. 이제 더 이상 비싼 구독료를 내지 않아도 최신 AI 모델의 파워를 경험할 수 있게 된 거죠. 물론 무료 사용에는 약간의 제약이 있지만, 저의 경험상 일상적인 사용이나 가벼운 작업에는 전혀 부족함이 없었어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">GPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 것을 넘어, <b>작업의 종류를 스스로 판단하여 최적의 모델을 선택</b>해주는 '실시간 라우터' 기능까지 탑재했습니다. 이전처럼 GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini 같은 복잡한 모델들을 일일이 비교하며 고민할 필요가 없어진 거죠. 저는 이 부분이 정말 좋다고 생각해요. 우리가 필요한 건 결국 최고의 결과물이니까요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">학술 에세이부터 소셜 미디어 콘텐츠, 심지어 이미지 생성이나 코드 작성, 문서 요약 및 분석까지 &mdash; GPT-5는 정말 다재다능해요. 응답의 정확도는 45%나 향상되었고, 무엇보다 글쓰기 품질이 훨씬 자연스러워졌습니다. 아이디어 구상 단계에서는 거의 완벽에 가까운 파트너라고 할 수 있죠. 만약 ChatGPT의 답변이 '음, 좀 부족한데?' 싶을 때만 유료 구독을 고려해도 늦지 않을 거예요.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>  팁:</b> 무료 GPT-5 사용량은 정해져 있지만, 대부분의 캐주얼한 사용에는 충분합니다. 하지만 만약 AI의 답변 품질이 급격히 떨어진다고 느껴진다면, 일일 사용량 한도를 초과했을 가능성이 높으니 잠시 기다리거나 다른 무료 툴과 병행하는 것을 추천해요.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  GitHub Copilot: 코딩의 든든한 조력자</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발자라면 <u><b><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><a style=\"color: #006dd7;\" href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub Copilot</a></span></b></u>을 모르는 분이 거의 없을 겁니다. 그런데 이 강력한 코딩 AI를 <b>Visual Studio Code용 무료 버전</b>으로도 만날 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 매월 2,000건의 코드 완성 기능과 50건의 채팅 요청을 무료로 사용할 수 있어요. 하루 업무 시간으로 따지면 약 80건의 코드 완성 기능인데, 개인 프로젝트나 학습용으로는 정말 충분한 양이라고 생각해요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"vs code.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"988\" data-origin-height=\"704\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bgJVyJ/btsQkVgdtaH/9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbgJVyJ%2FbtsQkVgdtaH%2F9RrflC6e69dpJKI9cvy1t1%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"vs code 용 GitHub Copilot\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"988\" height=\"704\" data-filename=\"vs code.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"988\" data-origin-height=\"704\"/></span></figure>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">놀랍게도 이 무료 플랜에는 OpenAI, Google, Anthropic 등 최고 수준의 AI 모델들이 포함되어 있습니다. 신용카드 정보나 별도의 가입 절차 없이 GitHub 계정만 있으면 바로 이용 가능하죠. 웹 툴과 Visual Studio Code 확장 프로그램 형태로 모두 제공되어, 개발자들이 가장 많이 사용하는 코드 에디터 내에서 편리하게 사용할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 전체 프로젝트의 골격을 만들거나, 코드 샘플 또는 바로 사용 가능한 저장소 구조를 몇 분 만에 얻을 수 있어요. 특히 Visual Studio Code에서 사용하면 전체 프로젝트를 인식하여 여러 파일과 동시에 작업할 수 있는 <b>'프로젝트 인지' 기능</b>은 정말 강력합니다. 그리고 무엇보다, 학생이나 교사, 혹은 인기 있는 오픈소스 프로젝트를 관리하는 분들은 Copilot Pro를 무료로 받을 수 있다는 사실! 학생분들은 이 혜택을 꼭 놓치지 말고 활용해보세요.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  Perplexity: 빠른 정보 탐색과 심층 연구의 동반자</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">어떤 주제에 대해 빠르게 정보를 찾아야 할 때, 저는 항상 <b><u><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><a style=\"color: #006dd7;\" href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Perplexity</a></span></u></b>를 찾게 돼요. 이 툴은 기존의 전통적인 연구 방식을 완전히 대체하진 못하지만, 특정 주제에 대한 사전 지식이 조금이라도 있다면 <b>정보를 취합하고 정리하는 데 정말 유용</b>합니다. 특히 명확한 출처를 인용하고 대부분 실시간 정보를 제공한다는 점이 큰 장점이죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Perplexity의 무료 계정은 기본 검색은 무제한으로 제공하고, 매일 5번의 Pro 검색 기회를 줍니다. 또한 하루에 3개의 파일을 첨부하여 AI가 문서를 분석하게 할 수도 있어요. 제가 직접 써보니, 자료 조사나 팩트 체크, 문서 요약 등 웬만한 연구 요구사항은 무료 버전으로도 충분히 해결할 수 있었습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #fce8e6; border-left: 4px solid #d93025; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>⚠️ 주의:</b> 무료 버전에서는 AI가 쿼리에 가장 적합한 모델(Sonar, Claude Sonnet 4.0, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro 등)을 자동으로 선택하는데, 이 선택이 항상 완벽하지 않을 수도 있다는 점을 염두에 두세요. 때로는 기대 이하의 응답을 받을 수도 있습니다.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래도 매일 3번의 'Research' 기능을 이용할 수 있다는 점은 큰 이점이에요.

ChatGPT의 심층 연구 기능도 좋지만, 저는 Perplexity의 Research 검색이 더 정확하고 업데이트된 정보를 제공하는 경우가 많다고 느꼈어요. 확실히 자료 검색에 특화된 툴이라는 생각이 듭니다.\n  Leonardo.AI: 상상력을 현실로, 무료 이미지 생성\nAI 이미지 생성, 이제 어렵거나 비쌀 필요가 없습니다. Leonardo.AI는 온라인에서 사용할 수 있는 최고의 멀티 모델 이미지 생성 툴 중 하나인데요. 무료 계정으로 매일 150개의 토큰을 제공하며, 이를 통해 최대 25개의 16:9 비율 1184x672 해상도 이미지를 Flux Schnell 모델로 생성할 수 있어요.\nGPT-Image-1을 포함한 다양한 모델들이 있지만, 이미지 생성에 필요한 토큰 수는 모델마다 다릅니다. 현재로서는 Flux Schnell 모델이 가장 저렴하게 이미지를 만들 수 있어, 프롬프트를 테스트하고 초기 아이디어를 구체화하는 데 아주 적합해요. 저는 이 툴을 이용해 다양한 시안을 빠르게 만들어보곤 하는데, 정말 효율적입니다.\n\n\n또한, AI 기반의 프롬프트 개선 기능이 있어서 초보자도 쉽게 좋은 결과물을 얻을 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 다양한 사전 설정된 이미지 생성 스타일도 있어서 유튜브 썸네일부터 회사 로고까지, 몇 분 안에 비용 부담 없이 만들 수 있어요. Canva나 PhotoPea 같은 무료 이미지 편집기와 함께 사용하면 더더욱 훌륭한 결과물을 얻을 수 있으니 꼭 시도해보세요.\n  FlexClip: 간편하게 AI 비디오 제작 도전하기\nAI 이미지 생성에 이어 AI 비디오 생성에도 도전하고 싶으신가요? FlexClip은 다양한 AI 기반 도구들을 갖춘 온라인 플랫폼입니다. 이미지, 비디오, 음성 등 여러 가지를 생성할 수 있지만, 특히 강력한 AI 비디오 생성 기능과 편리한 편집 툴이 돋보이는 곳이에요.\n무료 플랜으로는 720p HD 해상도로 비디오를 다운로드할 수 있고, 최대 12개의 프로젝트를 생성할 수 있으며, 각 비디오는 최대 10분 길이까지 가능해요. 프로젝트당 하나의 스톡 비디오와 오디오도 제공됩니다. 특히, AI 비디오 생성기와 AI 스크립트 작성기를 포함한 FlexClip의 AI 툴을 10회까지 무료로 시도해볼 수 있다는 점이 매력적이에요.\n\n\n \n 간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 AI가 스크립트를 작성하고, 이 스크립트를 기반으로 AI가 이미지를 조합하여 비디오를 만들어주는 방식입니다. 다만, 생성되는 비디오가 대부분 AI 생성 이미지의 시퀀스에 AI 음성이 내레이션을 하는 형태라는 점은 알아두시면 좋아요. 아직은 '와!' 할 정도의 고품질 실사 영상을 무료로 얻기는 어렵지만, 컨셉 비디오나 설명 영상 제작에는 충분히 활용 가능합니다.\nAI 비디오 생성은 이미지 생성과 달리, 무료로 '제대로 쓸만한' 결과물을 제공하는 서비스를 찾기가 정말 어려워요. FlexClip은 Leonardo.AI와 비슷한 크레딧 시스템을 사용하며, 구독 없이도 추가 크레딧을 구매하여 더 많은 AI 툴을 사용할 수 있습니다. 갑자기 비디오가 필요할 때 아주 유용한 옵션이 될 거예요.\n  Ollama: 나만의 AI 비서, 로컬에서 실행하기\n진정한 '무료 AI'의 맛을 보고 싶다면, 저는 주저 없이 Ollama를 추천합니다. 이 툴은 강력한 오픈소스 AI 모델들을 인터넷 연결 없이, 사용량 제한 없이, 그리고 가장 중요한 개인 데이터 유출 걱정 없이 여러분의 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이 점이 가장 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.\nLlama 3.2, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral 같은 유명 모델들을 여러분의 하드웨어 사양만 충분하다면 돌려볼 수 있어요. Ollama의 라이브러리 페이지에 가면 지원되는 모델 목록을 볼 수 있는데, 정말 다양한 종류가 있어서 각자의 컴퓨터 환경에 맞는 모델을 선택하기 좋죠. 최근에는 OpenAI와의 파트너십을 통해 최신 오픈 가중치 모델들도 Ollama에서 사용할 수 있게 되었다고 하니, 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n \n설치도 믿을 수 없을 정도로 빠르고 쉬웠어요.

마치 가게 문 앞에 멋진 간판이 없으면 손님들이 들어올 생각조차 하지 않는 것과 같아요. 제목은 독자와 검색엔진 모두에게 내 글의 첫인상을 결정하는 가장 중요한 요소입니다. 단순히 키워드를 나열하는 시대는 지났어요. 이제는 롱테일 키워드의 잠재력과 독자의 숨겨진 심리까지 파고드는 전략이 필요합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히 2025년에는 검색 알고리즘이 더욱 고도화되면서, 단순히 검색량 높은 키워드만 따라가는 방식으로는 한계가 명확해졌어요. 사용자의 <b>&lsquo;진짜 검색 의도&rsquo;</b>를 파악하고, 이를 제목에 녹여내는 것이야말로 죽어가는 키워드도 살려내고 상위 노출을 가능하게 하는 핵심 비법이 됩니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  기존 블로그 제목, 무엇이 문제일까요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 많은 블로그들을 분석하면서 느낀 점인데요, 많은 분들이 제목을 만들 때 몇 가지 공통적인 패턴을 보이시더라고요. 예를 들어, '손흥민 LAFC 이적설' 같은 주제를 다룬다고 할 때, 단순히 '손흥민 LAFC 이적설 정리'처럼 작성하는 경우가 많아요. 물론 나쁘다는 건 아니지만, 아쉽게도 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 좀 부족하다고 해야 할까요? 한번 기존 제목들의 일반적인 특징을 살펴볼게요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">기존 제목 분석 (일반적인 경향)</h3>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; margin-bottom: 20px;\">\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>핵심 키워드 중심:</b> 대부분 주제의 핵심이 되는 단어(예: 손흥민, 오이무침, 맥시부펜)만으로 제목을 구성하려는 경향이 강해요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>클릭 유도/특징 키워드 부족:</b> '공개', '비법', '간단한', '아삭하게' 등 사용자의 행동이나 감정을 유도하는 매력적인 단어들이 부족한 경우가 많아요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>구체적인 숫자/인물/고유 키워드 활용 미흡:</b> '백종원', '메시', 'BEST 50'처럼 신뢰나 호기심을 주는 구체적인 요소들이 잘 보이지 않아요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; color: #3c4043;\"><b>자극적인 문구 지양:</b> 너무 자극적인 문구는 지양하지만, 반대로 너무 평범해서 클릭 욕구를 떨어뜨리는 경향도 있어요.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론적으로, 기존 제목들은 <b>정보 전달에는 충실하지만, 차별성이 부족하고 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 약하다</b>는 단점이 있어요. 검색 결과 페이지에서 수많은 경쟁 글들 사이에서 내 글을 돋보이게 만들기가 어렵다는 거죠.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>TIP:</b> 당신의 블로그 제목이 혹시 위에서 언급한 단점들을 가지고 있지는 않나요?

        "contentSnippet": "블로그 제목, 그냥 만드시나요? 2025년에는 검색엔진과 사용자 심리를 동시에 사로잡는 전략이 필수입니다. 죽은 키워드도 살려내는 롱테일 키워드와 사용자 의도 분석의 만남, 그리고 네이버 상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM) 활용 팁까지, 이 글 하나로 당신의 블로그 클릭률을 폭발적으로 끌어올릴 비밀을 공개합니다.\n  왜 블로그 제목 전략이 중요할까요?\n\n\n \n 블로그 글을 아무리 열심히 써도, 사람들이 클릭하지 않으면 아무 소용 없겠죠? 마치 가게 문 앞에 멋진 간판이 없으면 손님들이 들어올 생각조차 하지 않는 것과 같아요. 제목은 독자와 검색엔진 모두에게 내 글의 첫인상을 결정하는 가장 중요한 요소입니다. 단순히 키워드를 나열하는 시대는 지났어요. 이제는 롱테일 키워드의 잠재력과 독자의 숨겨진 심리까지 파고드는 전략이 필요합니다.\n특히 2025년에는 검색 알고리즘이 더욱 고도화되면서, 단순히 검색량 높은 키워드만 따라가는 방식으로는 한계가 명확해졌어요. 사용자의 ‘진짜 검색 의도’를 파악하고, 이를 제목에 녹여내는 것이야말로 죽어가는 키워드도 살려내고 상위 노출을 가능하게 하는 핵심 비법이 됩니다.\n  기존 블로그 제목, 무엇이 문제일까요?\n제가 많은 블로그들을 분석하면서 느낀 점인데요, 많은 분들이 제목을 만들 때 몇 가지 공통적인 패턴을 보이시더라고요. 예를 들어, '손흥민 LAFC 이적설' 같은 주제를 다룬다고 할 때, 단순히 '손흥민 LAFC 이적설 정리'처럼 작성하는 경우가 많아요. 물론 나쁘다는 건 아니지만, 아쉽게도 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 좀 부족하다고 해야 할까요? 한번 기존 제목들의 일반적인 특징을 살펴볼게요.\n기존 제목 분석 (일반적인 경향)\n핵심 키워드 중심: 대부분 주제의 핵심이 되는 단어(예: 손흥민, 오이무침, 맥시부펜)만으로 제목을 구성하려는 경향이 강해요.\n클릭 유도/특징 키워드 부족: '공개', '비법', '간단한', '아삭하게' 등 사용자의 행동이나 감정을 유도하는 매력적인 단어들이 부족한 경우가 많아요.\n구체적인 숫자/인물/고유 키워드 활용 미흡: '백종원', '메시', 'BEST 50'처럼 신뢰나 호기심을 주는 구체적인 요소들이 잘 보이지 않아요.\n자극적인 문구 지양: 너무 자극적인 문구는 지양하지만, 반대로 너무 평범해서 클릭 욕구를 떨어뜨리는 경향도 있어요.\n결론적으로, 기존 제목들은 정보 전달에는 충실하지만, 차별성이 부족하고 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 힘이 약하다는 단점이 있어요. 검색 결과 페이지에서 수많은 경쟁 글들 사이에서 내 글을 돋보이게 만들기가 어렵다는 거죠.\n  TIP: 당신의 블로그 제목이 혹시 위에서 언급한 단점들을 가지고 있지는 않나요? 지금 바로 확인해보세요!\n✨ 2025년형 블로그 제목 전략: 롱테일과 사용자 심리 분석\n그럼 이제 어떻게 해야 할까요? 2025년에는 롱테일 키워드의 힘과 사용자 심리 분석을 결합한 제목 전략이 필요합니다. 상위 노출에 최적화된 제목은 단순히 정보를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 독자의 문제를 해결해주고, 궁금증을 자극하며, 명확한 가치를 제안해야 해요.\n롱테일 키워드, 왜 중요할까요?\n롱테일 키워드는 검색량은 적지만, 특정 의도를 가진 사용자가 검색할 확률이 높고 경쟁이 덜한 키워드를 말해요. 예를 들어, '블로그 제목'보다 '초보 블로거를 위한 클릭률 높이는 블로그 제목 전략'이 롱테일 키워드에 해당하죠. 이런 키워드를 공략하면 적은 노력으로도 상위 노출의 기회를 잡을 수 있답니다.\n사용자 심리 분석, 어떻게 제목에 녹여낼까요?\n사용자 심리 분석은 크게 세 가지 질문으로 시작해요.\n사용자의 문제점(Pain Point)은 무엇인가? (예: 블로그 제목을 어떻게 지어야 할지 모르겠다)\n사용자가 원하는 해결책은 무엇인가? (예: 클릭률이 높은 제목을 만들고 싶다)\n내 글이 제공하는 특별한 가치(Value Proposition)는 무엇인가? (예: 2025년형 최신 전략, GEM 활용 비법)\n이 세 가지 질문에 대한 답을 제목에 응축하여 담아내는 거죠. 정말 쉽지 않죠? 그래서 제가 오늘 아주 특별한 도구를 소개해 드리려고 합니다.\n  상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM) 활용 가이드\n네이버에서 제공하는 ‘상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM)’는 제가 위에서 설명한 복잡한 분석 과정을 자동으로 수행하여 최적의 제목을 제안해주는 정말 강력한 도구예요. 저도 블로그 글을 쓸 때 자주 활용하는데, 정말 만족도가 높았어요. 이 도구를 어떻게 활용하면 좋을지 구체적으로 알려드릴게요.\n \nGEM 만들기\n1. 새 GEM 만들기 : GEMINI 좌측 메뉴 - Gems 탐색하기 -  '+ 새 Gem' 버튼을 클릭합니다. \n\n\n \n2. GEM 생성 : 제목을 입력하고, 본문 아래 첨부된 TEXT 파일의 모든 내용을 요청사항에 붙여넣고 저장하면 GEM 이 만들어 집니다.\n\n\n \n \nGEM 활용\n프로세스 (네이버 Creator Advisor 연동)\n1. Creator Advisor 방문: 먼저 creator-advisor.naver.com에 접속해서 현재 트렌드 키워드와 관련 네이버 블로그 상위 기사 제목들을 파악하세요. 시장의 흐름과 경쟁 블로그들의 전략을 엿볼 수 있는 아주 좋은 기회예요. \n\n\n \n\n\n\n2. 주제 및 핵심 키워드 입력:  위의 제목 리스트를 캡쳐한후  GEM 실행후 업로드 하고 엔터만 하면!!\n3. GEM의 기존 제목 분석: GEM은 입력된 정보를 바탕으로 기존 제목들의 공통점을 분석해줍니다. 핵심 키워드, 클릭 유도 키워드, 구체적인 정보, 자극적인 문구 등을 카테고리별로 분류해서 보여줄 거예요. 이 부분이 정말 유용해요! 내 제목에 어떤 요소가 부족했는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있거든요. \n4. 최적화 제목 제안: 분석 결과를 토대로, GEM은 상위 노출에 최적화된 새로운 제목 대안 3가지를 제시합니다. 단순히 키워드 조합이 아니라, 앞서 설명했던 사용자의 Pain Point, 해결책, 가치 제안이 녹아든 제목들이에요. 각 제안별로 어떤 강점이 있는지 구체적으로 설명해줘서 왜 그 제목이 효과적인지 바로 이해할 수 있어요.\n\n\n\n4. 최종 제목 선택 및 개선: 제시된 제목들 중에서 가장 마음에 드는 것을 선택하거나, 또는 이를 바탕으로 나만의 개성을 담아 조금 더 다듬어 최종 제목으로 확정합니다. GEM이 준 제목을 그대로 써도 좋지만, 내 목소리를 더하면 더 좋겠죠!\n⚠️ 주의: GEM은 강력한 도구지만, 맹신은 금물! 도구의 제안을 참고하되, 최종적으로는 자신의 글 내용과 독자의 특성을 가장 잘 이해하는 블로거인 당신의 판단이 중요합니다.\n  분석 기반 상위 노출 최적화 제목 제안 (예시)\n위에서 설명드린 GEM의 프로세스를 거쳐 제가 직접 몇 가지 제목들을 생성해봤어요. 단순히 정보를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 신뢰도와 객관성을 향상시키고, 사용자의 Pain Point를 해결하여 완결성 있는 가치를 제안하는 제목들입니다.\n제안 1 (가장 추천): 문제 해결 및 가치 제안 강조 스타일\n2025 블로그 제목, 죽은 키워드도 살리는 롱테일 & 심리 분석 필승 전략\n강점: '2025'로 최신성을 강조하고, '죽은 키워드도 살리는'이라는 자극적인 문구로 독자의 호기심과 문제 해결 욕구를 동시에 자극합니다. '필승 전략'으로 해결책에 대한 기대감을 높여요.\n강점: '롱테일'과 '심리 분석'이라는 핵심 키워드를 명확히 제시하여 글의 전문성과 가치를 드러냅니다.\n제안 2: 구체적인 방법론 제시 및 전문가적 신뢰 강조 스타일\n클릭률 300% 상승? 롱테일과 사용자 의도 분석으로 블로그 제목 마스터하기\n강점: '클릭률 300% 상승?'이라는 구체적인 수치와 질문 형식으로 독자의 궁금증과 성과에 대한 기대를 불러일으킵니다.\n강점: '롱테일과 사용자 의도 분석'으로 핵심 방법론을 명확히 제시하고, '블로그 제목 마스터하기'로 최종적인 목표와 전문성을 강조해요.\n제안 3: 독자의 Pain Point 공감 및 실용적 해결책 제시 스타일\n“내 블로그 글 왜 안 읽지?” 네이버 상위 1%만 아는 제목 공식 대공개!\n강점: 독자의 흔한 고민을 직접적인 질문('내 블로그 글 왜 안 읽지?')으로 제시하여 강한 공감대를 형성합니다.\n강점: '네이버 상위 1%만 아는'이라는 희소성과 비밀스러운 정보에 대한 기대감을 높여 클릭을 유도합니다. '제목 공식 대공개'로 명확한 해결책을 제시해요.\n  핵심 요약\n1. 제목은 블로그의 얼굴: 단순히 정보 전달을 넘어 클릭을 유도하는 첫인상이자 검색엔진 최적화의 핵심입니다.\n2. 롱테일 키워드의 힘: 경쟁은 적고 의도는 명확한 롱테일 키워드로 상위 노출의 기회를 잡으세요.\n3. 사용자 심리 분석: 독자의 문제점, 원하는 해결책, 글의 특별한 가치를 제목에 녹여내세요.\n4. GEM으로 제목 마스터: 네이버 상위 노출 블로그 제목 생성기(GEM)를 활용해 효율적으로 최적의 제목을 찾아보세요.\n이 핵심 전략들을 통해 당신의 블로그 글이 더 많은 독자에게 가닿고, 더 큰 영향력을 발휘하기를 바랍니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 롱테일 키워드는 어떻게 찾나요?\nA1: 네이버 키워드 도구나 구글 키워드 플래너, 그리고 네이버 Creator Advisor 같은 도구를 활용하여 핵심 키워드와 연관된 확장 검색어들을 찾아볼 수 있습니다. 실제 사용자들이 어떤 질문을 하는지 파악하는 것이 중요해요.\nQ2: GEM이 제시한 제목을 꼭 그대로 사용해야 하나요?\nA2: 아니요, GEM은 최적화된 제목을 제안하는 도우미 역할을 합니다. 제안된 제목을 바탕으로 자신의 글의 개성과 문체에 맞춰 조금 더 다듬거나, 아이디어를 얻어 새로운 제목을 창조하는 것도 좋은 방법이에요.\nQ3: 모든 블로그 글에 제목 전략을 적용해야 하나요?\nA3: 네, 가능하면 모든 글에 적용하는 것이 좋습니다. 특히 검색 유입이 중요한 정보성 글이나 리뷰 글의 경우, 제목 전략이 클릭률과 상위 노출에 결정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다. 꾸준한 적용이 중요해요.\n자, 이제 2025년 블로그 제목 전략의 핵심과 GEM 활용법까지 모두 아셨으니, 여러분의 블로그 글이 더 많은 독자들에게 사랑받을 일만 남았네요! 이 전략들을 꾸준히 적용해서 여러분의 블로그가 상위 노출의 꿈을 이루시길 진심으로 응원합니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n \n\n    \n\n    \ngem 지침.txt\n0.00MB",

(VS 포토샵)</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">혹시 이런 생각 해보셨을 수도 있어요. \"이런 기능들, 포토샵 같은 전문 이미지 편집 프로그램으로도 할 수 있는 거 아닌가?\" 네, 맞아요. 기존 툴로도 할 수 있는 작업들이었죠. 하지만 여기서 우리가 주목해야 할 <b>결정적인 차이점들</b>이 있습니다. AI가 가져온 혁신이 무엇인지 명확히 알 수 있는 부분이에요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 압도적인 작업 시간 단축</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">가장 먼저 체감할 수 있는 차이는 <b>작업 시간의 엄청난 격차</b>입니다. 포토샵에서 한 사람의 얼굴 표정을 바꾸려면 숙련된 디자이너라도 몇 시간은 걸릴 작업일 겁니다. 그런데 나노바나나는 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘\"라고 한 마디만 하면 <b>10초 안에 결과</b>를 보여줍니다. 이게 바로 AI의 힘이자, 우리가 AI를 주목해야 하는 이유죠.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. 전문가 수준의 기술적 난이도 해소</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">두 번째는 <b>기술적 난이도</b>입니다. 포토샵으로 자연스러운 합성을 하려면 조명, 그림자, 색온도, 원근감까지 모든 요소를 수동으로 맞춰야 합니다. 이건 전문 지식과 경험이 없으면 불가능에 가까운 작업이에요. 나노바나나는 이 모든 것을 <b>AI가 알아서 계산하고 처리</b>해줍니다. 일반 사용자 입장에서는 정말 꿈같은 일이죠.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. 무한한 창의적 가능성 확장</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">마지막은 <b>창의적 가능성</b>입니다. 포토샵은 '기존 편집' 도구에 가깝지만, 나노바나나는 '없던 것을 새로 만들어내는' <b>생성형 AI</b>예요. \"이 사람을 중세 시대 기사로 만들어줘\"라고 입력하면, 갑옷부터 배경까지 모든 것을 새로 생성해서 자연스럽게 합성해줍니다. 포토샵으로는 상상하기 힘들 정도로 복잡한 작업이죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>  핵심 포인트:</b> 나노바나나는 <b>속도, 쉬운 접근성, 무한한 생성력</b> 면에서 기존 툴을 압도합니다. 전문 지식 없이도 높은 퀄리티의 결과물을 얻을 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 매력이죠.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>⚠️ 주의해야 할 점도 있어요</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">물론 나노바나나가 혁신적인 도구인 건 분명하지만, 만능은 아닙니다. AI 기반 도구들이 가진 <b>몇 가지 주의할 점</b>들도 분명히 존재해요. 이 점들을 잘 이해하고 사용한다면 훨씬 더 스마트하게 나노바나나를 활용할 수 있을 거예요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 정확성과 일관성 문제</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">포토샵은 사용자가 원하는 대로 정확히 조작할 수 있지만, AI는 가끔 <b>예상과 다른 결과</b>를 만들어내기도 해요. 복잡한 요구사항일수록 원하는 결과를 얻기까지 여러 번 시도하거나 프롬프트를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. 세밀한 컨트롤의 한계</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">포토샵은 픽셀 단위로 정밀하게 수정 가능하지만, AI는 아직 그 정도의 <b>세밀한 조정 능력</b>은 부족합니다. 전체적인 느낌은 훌륭하지만, 특정 부분의 디테일한 요청은 한계가 있을 수 있어요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. 예측 불가능성</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">같은 프롬프트를 입력해도 AI는 매번 <b>조금씩 다른 결과</b>를 내놓을 수 있습니다. 이것이 창의성 측면에서는 장점이지만, 정확히 예측 가능한 결과가 필요한 작업에서는 단점이 될 수 있죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론적으로, AI 이미지 편집은 <b>빠르고, 쉽고, 창의적인 작업</b>에는 혁신적입니다. 하지만 정밀하고 예측 가능한 전문 작업에서는 기존 툴들과 <b>함께 사용하는 것이 현명</b>하다고 생각해요. 특히 우리 같은 일반 사용자들에게는 나노바나나 같은 AI 도구가 정말 <b>게임 체인저</b>가 될 수 있다는 사실은 변함없죠. 무료로 사용할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  나노바나나로 나만의 앱 만들기: 두 가지 접근법</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이렇게 강력한 나노바나나 기능을 활용해서 나만의 AI 앱을 직접 만들어 볼 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 저는 두 가지 방법으로 접근해봤고, 과정이 정말 흥미로웠답니다!</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px; font-weight: 600;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1.

AI 이미지 작업에 관심 있는 분들이라면 이 글을 통해 놀라운 신세계를 경험하게 되실 겁니다.\n  나노바나나, 과연 무엇일까요?\n\n\n여러분, 혹시 나노바나나라는 이름을 들어보셨나요? 이름만 들어도 뭔가 귀엽고 동시에 최첨단 느낌이 들죠? 사실 이 매력적인 이름은 구글이 공식 발표한 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image 모델에 커뮤니티에서 붙여준 별명이에요. 왜 하필 '나노바나나'인지는 정확히 알려지지 않았지만, 확실히 더 친숙하게 느껴지는 건 저뿐만이 아닐 겁니다.\n중요한 점은 나노바나나가 단순히 이미지를 생성하는 수준을 넘어섰다는 거예요. 기존 AI 이미지 도구들과는 차원이 다른 성능을 보여줍니다. 텍스트 기반 생성 및 편집 기능이 업그레이드되었을 뿐만 아니라, 특히 캐릭터 일관성 유지와 다중 이미지 합성 능력을 혁신적으로 강화했죠. 이제 어떤 놀라운 일들을 할 수 있는지 구체적으로 파고들어 볼까요?\n✨ 나노바나나의 핵심 기능 3가지\n1. 놀라운 캐릭터 일관성 유지\n이 기능은 정말 많은 분들이 기다려왔던 혁신일 거예요. 기존 AI 도구들은 같은 캐릭터를 여러 장면에서 그릴 때마다 얼굴이 미묘하게 달라지는 문제가 있었거든요. 마치 쌍둥이인데 디테일이 조금씩 다른 느낌이랄까요? 나노바나나는 이 문제를 완전히 해결했습니다!\n비밀은 '정체성 임베딩 고정 기술'에 있습니다. 캐릭터의 얼굴 윤곽, 눈코입 비율, 헤어스타일, 의상 특징 등을 디지털 지문처럼 저장하고, 새로운 장면을 만들 때마다 이 지문을 참조해서 동일한 캐릭터를 완벽하게 유지하는 거죠. 예를 들어, 원본 캐릭터에게 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘. 안경을 씌워줘.\"라고 명령하면, AI는 캐릭터의 고유 지문에 웃는 표정과 안경을 자연스럽게 적용해준답니다. 정말 대단하지 않나요?\n2. 여러 이미지를 하나로 합치는 마법 같은 합성 능력\n두 번째 핵심 기능은 다중 이미지 합성 능력입니다. 예를 들어, 가족사진과 환상적인 풍경 사진이 있다고 해보세요. 나노바나나에게 \"이 가족을 저 배경에 자연스럽게 배치해줘\"라고 요청하면, AI는 조명, 그림자, 원근감까지 모두 고려해서 원래부터 그 배경에서 찍었던 것처럼 완벽하고 자연스러운 합성 이미지를 만들어줍니다. 합성 티가 전혀 나지 않는다는 게 정말 핵심이죠.\n3. 오차 없는 정확한 텍스트 표현\n마지막은 이미지 내 텍스트를 정확하게 표현하는 능력입니다. 기존 AI 이미지 도구들은 글자를 넣어달라고 하면 뒤틀리거나 깨지는 경우가 많았어요. 하지만 나노바나나는 로고, 포스터, 간판 등 어떤 시각물을 만들 때도 글자를 정확하고 깔끔하게 넣어줍니다.\n예를 들어, 특정 웨비나 안내 포스터를 \"텍스트는 영어로\" 지정해서 만들어달라고 하면, 텍스트 내용까지 정확하게 반영된 이미지를 생성해줍니다. 아직 한글 렌더링은 지원하지 않지만, 현재 결과물을 보면 조만간 한글도 완벽하게 지원할 날이 머지않았다는 생각이 들어요. 정말 기대되는 부분이죠.\n  나노바나나, 기존 툴과 무엇이 다를까? (VS 포토샵)\n혹시 이런 생각 해보셨을 수도 있어요. \"이런 기능들, 포토샵 같은 전문 이미지 편집 프로그램으로도 할 수 있는 거 아닌가?\" 네, 맞아요. 기존 툴로도 할 수 있는 작업들이었죠. 하지만 여기서 우리가 주목해야 할 결정적인 차이점들이 있습니다. AI가 가져온 혁신이 무엇인지 명확히 알 수 있는 부분이에요.\n1. 압도적인 작업 시간 단축\n가장 먼저 체감할 수 있는 차이는 작업 시간의 엄청난 격차입니다. 포토샵에서 한 사람의 얼굴 표정을 바꾸려면 숙련된 디자이너라도 몇 시간은 걸릴 작업일 겁니다. 그런데 나노바나나는 \"이 사람을 웃게 해줘\"라고 한 마디만 하면 10초 안에 결과를 보여줍니다. 이게 바로 AI의 힘이자, 우리가 AI를 주목해야 하는 이유죠.\n2. 전문가 수준의 기술적 난이도 해소\n두 번째는 기술적 난이도입니다. 포토샵으로 자연스러운 합성을 하려면 조명, 그림자, 색온도, 원근감까지 모든 요소를 수동으로 맞춰야 합니다. 이건 전문 지식과 경험이 없으면 불가능에 가까운 작업이에요. 나노바나나는 이 모든 것을 AI가 알아서 계산하고 처리해줍니다. 일반 사용자 입장에서는 정말 꿈같은 일이죠.\n3. 무한한 창의적 가능성 확장\n마지막은 창의적 가능성입니다. 포토샵은 '기존 편집' 도구에 가깝지만, 나노바나나는 '없던 것을 새로 만들어내는' 생성형 AI예요. \"이 사람을 중세 시대 기사로 만들어줘\"라고 입력하면, 갑옷부터 배경까지 모든 것을 새로 생성해서 자연스럽게 합성해줍니다. 포토샵으로는 상상하기 힘들 정도로 복잡한 작업이죠.\n  핵심 포인트: 나노바나나는 속도, 쉬운 접근성, 무한한 생성력 면에서 기존 툴을 압도합니다. 전문 지식 없이도 높은 퀄리티의 결과물을 얻을 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 매력이죠.\n⚠️ 주의해야 할 점도 있어요\n물론 나노바나나가 혁신적인 도구인 건 분명하지만, 만능은 아닙니다. AI 기반 도구들이 가진 몇 가지 주의할 점들도 분명히 존재해요. 이 점들을 잘 이해하고 사용한다면 훨씬 더 스마트하게 나노바나나를 활용할 수 있을 거예요.\n1. 정확성과 일관성 문제\n포토샵은 사용자가 원하는 대로 정확히 조작할 수 있지만, AI는 가끔 예상과 다른 결과를 만들어내기도 해요. 복잡한 요구사항일수록 원하는 결과를 얻기까지 여러 번 시도하거나 프롬프트를 수정해야 할 수도 있습니다.\n2. 세밀한 컨트롤의 한계\n포토샵은 픽셀 단위로 정밀하게 수정 가능하지만, AI는 아직 그 정도의 세밀한 조정 능력은 부족합니다. 전체적인 느낌은 훌륭하지만, 특정 부분의 디테일한 요청은 한계가 있을 수 있어요.\n3. 예측 불가능성\n같은 프롬프트를 입력해도 AI는 매번 조금씩 다른 결과를 내놓을 수 있습니다. 이것이 창의성 측면에서는 장점이지만, 정확히 예측 가능한 결과가 필요한 작업에서는 단점이 될 수 있죠.\n결론적으로, AI 이미지 편집은 빠르고, 쉽고, 창의적인 작업에는 혁신적입니다. 하지만 정밀하고 예측 가능한 전문 작업에서는 기존 툴들과 함께 사용하는 것이 현명하다고 생각해요. 특히 우리 같은 일반 사용자들에게는 나노바나나 같은 AI 도구가 정말 게임 체인저가 될 수 있다는 사실은 변함없죠. 무료로 사용할 수 있다는 점도 큰 장점입니다.\n  나노바나나로 나만의 앱 만들기: 두 가지 접근법\n이렇게 강력한 나노바나나 기능을 활용해서 나만의 AI 앱을 직접 만들어 볼 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 저는 두 가지 방법으로 접근해봤고, 과정이 정말 흥미로웠답니다!\n1. '바이브 코딩 아이디어 챗봇' 활용\n\n\n\n\n'바이브 코딩 아이디어 챗' 실행 후, 나노바나나의 새 기능(일관성 유지, 자연스러운 합성, 정밀 수정)을 활용한 앱 아이디어(원본 사진 업로드 후 합성/복원/컬러화)를 요청했습니다.\n챗봇과 대화하며 앱 제작 질문 10개를 완성, 이를 복사하여 AI STUDIO의 BUILD에 순차적으로 입력했습니다. (한 번에 다 넣기보단 한두 개씩 빌드업 추천!)\n처음엔 UI가 영어로, 합성 기능에 에러가 있었지만, '한국어 버전으로 변경', '프롬프트 결과를 흰색으로 변경', 'Auto Fix' 기능 등을 활용해 해결했습니다. 사진 복원 기능도 나중에 복원, 컬러화, 업스케일 기능을 추가 요청하여 완성했죠. 바이브 코딩은 때론 디버깅이 필요하답니다.\n바이브코딩 아이디어 챗 + 나노바나나 활용 앱 바로가기\n \n2. 구글 나노바나나 프롬프트 가이드 기반 제작\n\n\n\nAI STUDIO 설정에서 나노 이미지 문서 페이지로 이동, '프롬프트 엔지니어링' 섹션의 가이드 내용을 메모장에 저장했습니다.\nBUILD 섹션에서 저장한 가이드를 업로드하고 \"첨부 문서를 분석하고, 문서에 포함된 모든 이미지 생성, 편집과 프롬프트 기법이 반영된 한글 앱을 만들어\"라고 요청했습니다.\n프롬프트 가이드 기반 앱도 잘 작동하는 것을 확인했어요. 바이브 코딩은 직접 요청, 디자인 제공, 문서 학습 등 다양한 방식으로 사용자가 원하는 결과를 얻을 수 있도록 돕는 유연한 플랫폼입니다.\n \n나노바나나 프로프트 엔지니어링 가이드 활용한 앱 바로가기\n \n  바나나 캔버스 무료 공개! 스마트 이미지 작업의 시작\n\n\n이런 과정을 거쳐 제가 만든 앱이 바로 '바나나 캔버스'입니다. 이 앱은 구글의 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image (나노바나나)와 이마젠 4.0을 기반으로 한 올인원 이미지 생성 및 편집 도구예요. 직접 써보니 정말 상상 이상의 편리함을 제공하더군요.\n바나나 캔버스는 텍스트 설명만으로 이미지를 창조하고, 기존 이미지를 전문가 수준으로 편집하며, 여러 이미지를 창의적으로 합성하는 등 다채로운 시각적 작업을 지원합니다. 핵심 차별점은 강력한 '프롬프트 제안' 기능이에요. AI가 사용자의 의도를 분석해 최적의 지시문을 자동 생성해주므로, 복잡한 프롬프트 지식 없이도 누구나 전문가 수준의 결과물을 손쉽게 얻을 수 있습니다.\n ️ 바나나 캔버스 화면 구성 한눈에 보기 (입력-제어-결과)\n바나나 캔버스는 사용자가 직관적으로 작업 흐름을 따라갈 수 있도록 '입력, 제어, 결과'의 3단 구조로 화면이 설계되어 있어요. 왼쪽에서 오른쪽으로 자연스럽게 작업이 진행되어 처음 사용하는 분들도 어렵지 않을 겁니다.\n1. 왼쪽: 모든 작업의 시작점 '입력'\n모든 작업의 시작점. 텍스트로 새 이미지를 만들거나, PC 이미지를 불러와 '빠른 작업'을 실행할 수 있습니다.\n2. 중앙: 핵심 제어 영역 '편집 및 합성'\n이미지 편집과 합성의 핵심. 불러온 이미지의 스타일 변경이나 여러 이미지 합성 등 구체적인 지시를 내리는 곳입니다.\n3. 오른쪽: 최종 결과 확인 영역 '결과'\nAI가 생성한 최종 결과물 표시 영역. 로딩, 오류, 완성 이미지 확인 및 저장 공간입니다.\n ️ 바나나 캔버스의 주요 기능 상세 가이드\n이제 바나나 캔버스가 제공하는 주요 기능들을 좀 더 자세히 알아볼 시간이에요. 정말 다재다능한 툴이라는 걸 느끼실 겁니다.\n1. 텍스트로 새 이미지 만들기\n아이디어만으로 완전히 새로운 이미지를 만들어내는 기능. 아이디어 입력 → 카테고리 선택 → 종횡비 선택 → 이미지 생성 순으로 진행합니다. \"밤하늘을 나는 고래\"처럼 간단한 아이디어를 입력해도 AI가 전문적인 지시문으로 자동 변환해주니, 프롬프트 지식 없이도 전문가 수준의 결과물을 얻을 수 있어요.\n2. 이미지를 업로드하고 '빠른 작업' 활용하기\nPC 이미지를 불러와 모든 작업의 기준으로 삼는 기능. 업로드 후 '빠른 작업'으로 자주 사용하는 편집을 원클릭으로 실행할 수 있습니다.\n배경 제거: 피사체만 깔끔하게 제거, 투명 PNG 파일로 저장.\n부분 삭제: 지우고 싶은 부분을 칠하면 AI가 주변과 어울리게 채워줍니다.\n증명사진 변환: 인물 사진을 정장/흰색 배경으로 변환, 정면 사진이 아니어도 정면으로 변환까지!\n평면도를 3D로: 2D 건축 평면도를 가구가 배치된 사실적인 3D 아이소메트릭 뷰로 시각화.\n만화 패널 변환: 이미지를 만화 장면처럼 변환 (느와르, 웹툰, 코믹스 스타일 선택 가능). 텍스트 언어 지정 (한국어 렌더링은 아직 완벽하지 않음).\n3. 중앙 제어 영역의 고급 기능들\n더 강력하고 전문적인 기능들을 살펴볼 차례입니다.\n복원 기능: 오래된 사진 손상 채우기, 흑백 컬러화, 2~4배 업스케일.\n채색하기: 스케치/라인 아트에 색과 명암을 칠해 완성된 일러스트로.\n스타일 변환: 원본의 구도/내용 유지, 아트 스타일만 재창조 (예: 피규어, 애니메이션).\n이미지 합성: 여러 이미지를 놀랍도록 자연스럽게 합성 (예: 가족+바다, 모델+가방+선글라스+한복).\n인생 앨범 제작: 인물 사진 한 장으로 유아기부터 노년기까지의 모습이 담긴 콜라주 앨범 생성. 정말 특별한 기능이에요!\n바나나 캔버스 (BANANA CANVAS) 바로 사용하기\n  핵심 요약\n1. 나노바나나는 구글 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image의 별명으로, 캐릭터 일관성, 다중 이미지 합성, 정확한 텍스트 렌더링 등 혁신적 성능을 자랑합니다.\n2. 포토샵 등 기존 툴 대비 압도적인 작업 시간 단축, 낮은 기술적 난이도, 무한한 창의적 가능성을 제공합니다.\n3.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나를 만난 전문직 – 교수, 의사, 변호사, 연예인 등 – 파트타임 창업가들은 잘 알 텐데, 나는 이런 분들한테 투자하지 않는다. 최근 몇 개월 동안 이런 회사들을 몇 개 만났는데, 아직도 이렇게 여러 가지 일을 동시에 완벽하게 할 수 있다고 생각하는 분들이 많다는 것에 좀 놀랐다.\n창업이 과거에 비해 더 쉬워졌고, 더 저렴해졌고, 요샌 일부 일을 AI가 대신해 주지만, 일단 스타트업은 남들보다 더 짧은 시간에 저 많은 성장을 압축해서 만들어야 한다. 그리고 이렇게 하기 위해선 기본적으로 더 많이, 더 열심히 일해야 한다. 그리고 집착해야 한다. 제품에 집착해야 하고, 고객에게 집착해야 하고, 펀드레이징에 집착해야 하고, 좋은 사람을 회사에 채용하는 것에 집착해야 한다. 그리고 이런 집착은 기본적으로 사업에 올인하지 않으면 생길 수가 없다. 취미생활로 스타트업을 하는 분들에게 집착은 생길 수가 없다.\n풀타임으로 학교에서 학생들을 가르치는 교수들이 스타트업을 창업했다면, 그리고 이분들이 대표이사라도, 이분들에겐 여전히 교직생활이 풀타임 업무이다. 스타트업은 그냥 투잡 중 하나의 부업이자 취미생활이다. 왜냐하면, 이분의 우선순위는 항상 학교가 될 것이기 때문이다. 학교에 소속되어 있고, 여기서 주 수입이 나오기 때문에, 회사 일을 하다 가도 갑자기 학교에서 부르면 그쪽으로 뛰어가야 한다.\n풀타임으로 병원에서 일하는 의사가 스타트업을 창업했다면, 이분에게도 의사가 풀타임 업무이고 스타트업은 부업이자 취미생활이다.\n풀타임으로 방송 생활을 하거나 연기를 하는 연예인이 스타트업을 창업했다면, 이분에게도 연예인이 풀타임 업무이고 스타트업은 부업이자 취미생활이다.\n나의 이 발언을 보고 발끈하는 분들이 분명히 있을 것이다. 실제 대면 미팅에서도 내가 “그럼 사업은 누가 하나요?”라고 물어보면 흥분하시는 분들이 상당히 많다. 대부분 돌아오는 답변은 거의 비슷하다. 교수님들은 학교에서 가르치는 과목이 별로 없어서 나머지 시간은 전부 다 회사에서 보낸다고 하고, 의사들은 병원이 본인 없어도 잘 돌아가기 때문에 대부분의 시간은 스타트업하는 데 보낸다고 하고, 연예인들은 연예 활동을 계속하는 것이 회사 일에 큰 도움이 된다고 한다. 그리고 그 누구도 이 사업에 언젠가는 완전히 올인 하겠다는 계획을 하고 있지 않다. 계속 본인들은 파트타임이고, 대표이사 또는 공동창업가라서 회사의 큰 결정에 관여할 것이지만, 결국 실제 사업은 다른 코파운더나 다른 직원들이 할 것이라고 한다. 실은, 그렇게 말하진 않지만, 결국 말을 들어보면 이런 의미라고 나는 해석한다.\n이런 분들이 운영하는 회사는 좋은 성과를 못 만드나? 꼭 그런 건 아니다. 우리 주변에 교수, 의사, 연예인, 변호사가 창업한 회사가 잘 되는 경우를 찾아보면 그 사례가 적지 않을 것이다. 하지만, 이런 회사들이 유니콘이 되는 경우는 거의 없다. 왜냐하면 유니콘을 만들기 위해선 사업에 집착해야 하고, 집착이란 1년 365일, 하루 24시간 사업에 대해서만 생각해야지만 생기는 것이기 때문이다.\nLA에 본사를 둔 The Honest Company라는 스타트업이 있다. 이 회사의 공동창업가는 배우 제시카 알바인데, 연예인들이 이분 같이 사업에 집착할 수 있다면 어쩌면 유니콘을 만들 수 있을 것이다. 나도 우리 포트폴리오사와의 협력 때문에 알바씨를 두 번 직접 만나본 적이 있다. 내가 듣기론 이분은 회사를 하기 위해서 모든 연기 활동을 잠정적으로 중단했고, 다른 직원분들에게 물어보니 매일 회사에 출근해서 밤늦게까지 일한다고 들었다. 그리고 회사의 모든 미팅에 참석하고, 모든 투자자 미팅에도 참석했다. 우리가 했던 미팅에도 전부 다 들어왔고, 준비를 잘하고 들어와서 좋은 대화를 할 수 있었다. 이 정도면 가능하다.\n회사에 매일 출근하지 않고, 회사의 모든 미팅에 참석하지 않고, 회사에 대해서 매일 24시간 고민하고 생각하지 않는다면, 집착이 생길 수 없고, 집착하지 않으면 유니콘은 만들 수가 없다. 현재 풀타임 직업/직책의 유명세, 지위, 네트워크가 어려운 미팅을 몇 번 성사시킬 순 있지만, 유니콘을 만드는 것은 유명세나 지위가 아니라 집착이다.",

MLS는 왜 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수 영입에 집중하는 걸까요?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}‘경제공동체’로 묶인 MLS\nMLS의 구조는 일반적인 유럽 리그와 다릅니다. 30개 구단은 독립적으로 운영되지만, 동시에 MLS라는 기업의 지분을 가진 투자자이기도 합니다. 다시 말해 MLS 전체의 적자가 곧 구단의 적자가 되기 때문에 30개 구단은 하나의 경제 공동체로 묶여 있는 셈이죠.\n이 때문에 구단이 벌어들이는 입장 수입의 30%와 선수 이적료 수입의 25%는 MLS가 가져갑니다. 반대로 MLS가 확보한 전국 방송 중계권료와 리그 스폰서십 수익은 다시 구단에 배분됩니다. 이런 구조 덕분에 MLS는 ‘싱글 엔터티(Single Entity)’라는 독특한 운영 모델을 가지고 성장할 수 있었습니다.\n이를 상징하는 지표가 바로 신규 구단 창단 가입금(Expansion Fee)입니다. 신규 구단이 MLS의 ‘주주’가 되기 위해 내야 하는 금액인데, 이 금액이 폭등하고 있습니다. 2005년 104억 원 수준이던 가입금은 2023년 샌디에이고 FC 창단 당시 6,929억 원에 달했습니다. 18년 사이에 무려 70배 가까이 오른 것이죠. 이는 투자처로서 MLS의 가치가 얼마나 올라갔는지를 보여줍니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\nMLS의 성장에 함께한\n사커 맘, 히스패닉, NFL\nMLS의 성장에는 리그 구조뿐 아니라 사회·문화적 배경도 크게 작용했습니다. 대표적으로 1990년대 후반 ‘사커 맘’ 열풍이 있었습니다. 당시만 해도 미국에서 축구는 흔하지 않았고 비용도 많이 드는 스포츠였지만, 교외에 살던 중산층 어머니들은 자녀 교육과 또래 교류를 위해 축구를 선택했습니다. 그렇게 성장한 아이들은 자연스럽게 축구와 MLS에 친숙해졌습니다.\n히스패닉 팬덤도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. 현재 MLS 팬의 약 30%는 히스패닉입니다. 축구 강국 출신 이민자들은 MLS의 주요 팬층으로 자리 잡았고, MLS도 이들을 겨냥해 플로리다·캘리포니아 등 히스패닉 밀집 지역에 구단을 세웠습니다. 메시의 인터 마이애미와 손흥민의 LAFC가 대표적이죠. 더 나아가 MLS의 마케팅 자회사 SUM은 멕시코 대표팀의 미국 내 중계권과 스폰서십 권리까지 확보하며 안정적인 수익원을 마련했습니다.\nNFL과의 협력도 중요했습니다. MLS 상위 구단 대부분이 NFL 팀과 경기장을 공유합니다. 평균 관중 46,831명으로 MLS에서 가장 많은 관중을 모으는 애틀랜타 유나이티드의 경우, NFL 구단 애틀랜타 팰컨스와 같은 경기장을 홈으로 사용하고 있습니다. NFL은 시즌당 홈 경기가 8회뿐이어서 경기장 활용도를 높이기 위해 MLS와 협력하는 것이 유리했습니다. 반대로 MLS는 새로운 축구 전용 경기장을 짓지 않고 NFL 경기장을 활용하면서 비용을 줄일 수 있었죠.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}애틀랜타 팰컨스와 애틀랜타 유나이티드가 함께 사용하는 Mercedes-Benz Stadium / 사진: Sipa USA\nMLS의 경영 철학은\n연봉 지출 최소화\nMLS는 리그 사업권과 선수 계약권을 직접 소유하고 있습니다. 구단은 단지 그 권리를 위임받아 운영할 뿐이죠. 그래서 모든 구단은 리그가 정한 규칙 안에서 움직여야 합니다. MLS 소속 선수들이 똑같이 아디다스 유니폼을 입는 것도 같은 맥락입니다.\n이런 구조 속에서 MLS는 철저히 비용 통제를 이어왔습니다. 대표적인 장치가 샐러리 캡(Salary Cap)*입니다. 2025년 기준으로 MLS 한 팀이 쓸 수 있는 연봉 총액은 약 83억 원. 미국 4대 프로스포츠(NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)와 비교하면 확연히 낮은 수준입니다.\n* 팀이 선수 연봉에 쓸 수 있는 총액을 제한하는 제도\n\n짠물 경영은 구단 운영 안정성에는 도움이 됐지만, 미국 축구의 저변 확대에는 큰 걸림돌이 되었습니다. 운동 능력이 뛰어난 유망주들이 더 많은 연봉을 보장받을 수 있는 야구·농구·미식축구 대신 굳이 축구를 선택할 이유가 없었던 것이죠. 자유계약(FA) 제도마저 없어 연봉 대박을 노릴 기회도 없으니, MLS는 재능 있는 인재들을 끌어들이지 못했습니다.\n이 때문에 미국 대표팀 성적이 부진할 때마다 MLS의 낮은 연봉 정책은 도마에 올랐습니다. 그러나 리그는 쉽게 방향을 틀 수 없었습니다. 1968년부터 1984년까지 운영되던 북미사커리그(NASL)가 과도한 연봉 지출로 몰락한 전례가 있었기 때문입니다. 당시 NASL은 펠레, 베켄바워, 크루이프 같은 슈퍼스타에게 천문학적인 돈을 쓰다 결국 도산했죠.\n스타 선수를 데려오기 위해\nMLS가 도입한 제도\nMLS는 오랫동안 샐러리 캡을 무기로 선수 인건비를 억제해왔습니다. 하지만 2000년대 중반, 리그는 스타 파워 부족이라는 고민에 직면했습니다. 세계적인 선수를 데려오려면 이적료뿐 아니라 고액 연봉이 필수인데, 샐러리 캡 안에서는 불가능했기 때문입니다.\n결국 2007년, 데이비드 베컴이 LA 갤럭시에 합류하면서 새로운 제도가 도입됐습니다. 바로 ‘지정 선수 제도(일명 베컴 룰)’입니다. 한 팀에서 최대 3명까지는 연봉을 샐러리 캡 적용에서 제외할 수 있도록 한 것이죠. 여기에 MLS는 일반 할당금(General Allocation Money)과 목표 할당금(Targeted Allocation Money)이라는 장치도 추가했습니다. 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수를 데려올 때 MLS가 이적료와 연봉의 일부를 지원하는 방식입니다.\n2025년 기준으로 모든 구단은 연간 약 40억 원의 일반 할당금과 30억 원의 목표 할당금을 배정받습니다. 이 제도 덕분에 제라드, 램파드, 루니, 앙리, 즐라탄 같은 유럽의 빅스타들이 차례로 MLS로 건너왔습니다. 미국 팬들에게는 친숙한 얼굴들이었고, 이는 곧 MLS의 대중적 인지도와 팬덤 확장으로 이어졌습니다.\n하지만 부작용도 있었습니다. 리그가 은퇴 직전의 베테랑들을 끌어모으면서 MLS는 펜션 리그(Pension League)라는 꼬리표를 달게 됐습니다. 전성기를 지난 선수들이 마지막으로 연금을 챙기는 무대라는 비아냥이었죠. 그만큼 젊은 유망주 육성은 뒷전이 됐고, 리그가 미국 축구의 경쟁력 강화보다는 수익 극대화에만 치중한다는 비판이 뒤따랐습니다.\nEPL 견제를 위해\nMLS가 선택한 메시\n미국 4대 프로 스포츠*는 세계 최고 수준의 경기력과 산업 규모를 갖추고 있어 해외 리그를 경쟁 상대로 두지 않습니다. 하지만 MLS는 다릅니다. 세계 최고 수준의 프로 축구 리그가 유럽에 있고, 그중에서도 EPL(잉글랜드 프리미어리그)은 이미 미국 시장에서 막강한 팬덤을 확보했습니다. NBC가 EPL 중계권에 매년 6,238억 원을 지불하는 이유도 여기에 있습니다. 이는 애플TV가 MLS 중계권에 지불하는 금액(3,466억 원)의 거의 두 배죠.\n* NFL(미식축구), NBA(농구), MLB(야구), NHL(아이스하키)\nEPL의 영향력이 커지자 MLS는 새로운 도전을 시작해야 했고, 답은 명확했습니다. 당장 펜션 리그라는 비난을 받더라도 스타 선수 영입에 더 과감한 투자를 하는 것이었습니다. 경기력이나 상품성에서 당장 유럽 리그를 능가할 수는 없지만, EPL이 미국 시장을 잠식하는 것을 막기 위해서는 세계적인 아이콘을 확보할 필요가 있었죠.\n\nFC 바르셀로나에서 뛰던 베테랑 선수들을 대거 영입한 인터 마이애미 / 사진: Action Images\n그 선택은 리오넬 메시였습니다. 2023년, 살아 있는 전설, 메시는 인터 마이애미 유니폼을 입었습니다. 2025년 그의 연봉은 약 278억 원. MLS에서 이 숫자는 사실상 천문학적인 수준입니다. 메시 한 명의 연봉보다 팀 전체 연봉이 낮은 구단이 무려 21개에 달합니다. 아디다스 후원 계약과 MLS 중계 파트너 애플TV의 수익 공유까지 포함하면, 그의 연간 수입은 400억 원 이상으로 추정됩니다.\n메시 효과는 즉각적으로 나타났습니다. 애플TV의 MLS 중계 구독자 수는 두 배로 늘었고, 리그 스폰서십 수익은 13% 증가했습니다. 홈과 원정 경기를 가리지 않고 구름 관중이 몰려들었고, 메시가 이끄는 인터 마이애미는 2024년 정규리그 우승(서포터스 쉴드)을 차지했습니다. 동시에 MLS 구단 가운데 가장 많은 수입(약 2,501억 원)과 영업이익(695억 원)을 기록하며, ‘스타 한 명이 리그 전체를 바꿀 수 있다’는 사실을 입증했죠.\n펜션 리그 꼬리표를\n떼줄 선수, 손흥민\n2025년, 손흥민이 MLS 역대 최고 이적료인 367억 원을 기록하며 LAFC에 합류했습니다. 이 영입은 세계 축구의 중심을 노리는 MLS의 전략과, 리그 최고 클럽을 지향하는 LAFC의 야심이 맞아떨어진 결과였습니다.\n38세로 선수 생활 황혼기에 접어든 메시와 달리 손흥민은 아직 33세입니다. 앞으로 2~3년은 정상급 기량을 발휘할 수 있는 나이죠. 미국 내에서도 손흥민은 여전히 젊고 에너지가 넘치는 선수로 평가받습니다. 손흥민의 합류는 MLS가 오랫동안 따라붙은 ‘펜션 리그’ 이미지를 희석할 수 있는 카드였습니다.\nLAFC 역시 손흥민을 간절히 원했습니다. EPL 득점왕 출신인 손흥민은 ‘젊은 베테랑’으로서 여전히 월드 클래스 스타입니다. 계약 연장 옵션을 포함하면 2029년까지 활약할 수 있어, 명문 구단을 꿈꾸는 LAFC의 비전에 정확히 부합하는 자원이라고 할 수 있습니다.\n실제 성적과 구단 가치도 이를 뒷받침합니다. 2018년 MLS에 참가한 LAFC는 정규리그 우승 2회(2019, 2022), MLS 컵 우승 1회(2022)를 기록하며 꾸준히 좋은 성적을 내왔습니다. 2024년 기준 구단 가치는 1조 7,366억 원으로 MLS 전체 1위. 두터운 팬층을 바탕으로 안정적인 수익 모델을 갖추고 있다는 점에서, 메시 합류 전까지 관중 수 최하위였던 인터 마이애미와는 분명한 차별성을 보여줍니다. 게다가 LA가 약 23만 명으로 추산되는 한인 교민 사회라는 점도 매력적인 이유죠.\n\n미국에서 여전히 정상급 기량을 보이는 손흥민 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\nMLS가 북중미 월드컵에 거는 기대\nMLS는 수익 확대 측면에서는 분명 성공한 리그입니다. 하지만 아직 풀어야 할 숙제가 남아 있습니다. 리그 하부 구조를 튼튼히 하려면 유소년 육성 프로그램에 더 많은 관심과 투자가 필요합니다. 그래야 젊은 유망주들이 MLS에서 활약하면서 리그 경쟁력을 높일 수 있겠죠. 이를 위해 가장 먼저 개선해야 할 부분은 낮은 평균 연봉입니다. 지금처럼 연봉이 낮다면, 재능 있는 인재들이 다른 종목으로 빠져나가는 문제를 해결하기 어렵기 때문이죠.\n1994년 미국 월드컵은 MLS 창설의 출발점이었습니다. 2026년 북중미 월드컵은 MLS가 크게 도약할 기회입니다. 이를 위해서는 무엇보다 리그에서 활약하는 월드컵 스타들이 더 많이 등장해야 합니다. MLS 선수들이 월드컵 무대에서 주목받는다면, 리그의 위상은 물론 선수들의 몸값과 연봉 수준까지 자연스럽게 높아질 수 있을 것입니다.\n만약 한국 대표팀의 경기가 LA에서 열리고, 손흥민이 그 무대에서 대활약을 펼친다면 어떨까요. 그는 LAFC를 넘어 MLS 전체의 롤 모델이 될 가능성이 큽니다. 어쩌면 이것이야말로 손흥민이 MLS 이적을 결심한 결정적 이유일지도 모릅니다. 한국 대표팀 주장으로 쌓아온 그의 여정이 북중미 월드컵에서 해피엔딩으로 이어지길 기대해봅니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",

.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}얼라인먼트 위크는 반년마다 열리는 행사로, 토스 커뮤니티(전 계열사) 팀원들이 한 자리에 모여 지난 6개월을 회고하고 앞으로의 방향을 함께 그려나가는 기간입니다.\n이 얼라인먼트 무대에서는 단순히 성과만을 발표하지 않습니다. 성공이든 실패든 지난 학기 도전 속에서 얻은 인사이트를 솔직하게 나누고, 더 나은 방법을 함께 찾아가죠. 이 과정을 통해 토스팀은 각자 다른 영역에서 문제를 풀고 있지만, 결국 같은 방향을 향해 나아가고 있다는 걸 확인합니다.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}Pirate

안전하다고 말하는 길을 벗어나 낯선 바다로 나아갑니다. 필요하다면 낡은 규칙은 깨부수고, 큰 실패까지 기꺼이 감수합니다. 대신 그 실패를 발판 삼아 새로운 가능성을 계속 열어갑니다.\n해적의 위험한 항해는 결코 혼자가 아닙니다. 키를 잡는 사람, 돛을 올리는 사람, 해류를 읽는 사람. 역할은 달라도 모두 같은 배에 올라, 같은 목표를 향해 나아갑니다. 토스팀의 해적정신도 다르지 않습니다. 우리는 혼자일 때보다 함께할 때 더 멀리 갈 수 있다고 믿습니다. 이번 얼라인먼트 위크의 부제 ‘We Move as One’이 바로 그 믿음을 말해주죠.\n토스 리더들이 말하는 해적정신\n\n얼라인먼트의 막을 여는 ‘토스 커뮤니티데이’ 무대에서는 각 계열사 리더들이 한자리에 모여 지난 성과와 앞으로의 목표를 공유했습니다. 행사장을 가득 채운 팀원들의 뜨거운 반응은 항해를 앞둔 선원들의 결의를 보는 듯했죠.\n무대 위에서는 각 리더가 정의하는 ‘해적정신’에 대한 짧은 한마디도 들을 수 있었습니다. 같은 해적단이지만 저마다 다른 배를 이끄는 선장들인 만큼, 그들의 해적정신은 닮은 듯 각자 뚜렷한 개성이 드러났어요.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px

생각하는 해적정신은, 생명을 다해도 아깝지 않을 항해에 도전하는 겁니다. 그 긴 여정에 시간을 쏟는 게 헛되지 않도록, 사회에 의미 있는 변화를 만드는 것. 그럴 때 이 항해는 결코 아깝지 않을 겁니다.\n\n손병두 (Toss Insight Leader)\n해적정신은 두려움보다 용기를, 개인보다 동료를 믿는 태도입니다. 제도라는 낡은 항로를 벗어나 새로운 물길을 내는 정신이죠. 우리는 혼자가 아니라 함께 움직입니다. 앞으로도 멋진 항해를 이어갑시다.\n\n김규빈 (Toss Securities Leader)\n항해를 멈추면 해적이 아니죠. 잠시 쉬어갈 수는 있어도 항해를 멈추지는 않습니다. 우리가 향하는 끝에는 누구나 투자할 수 있고, 누구나 투자로 삶을 바꿀 수 있는 세상이 있을 겁니다. 그날까지 우리는 계속 나아갑시다.\n\n이은미 (Toss Bank Leader)\n해적정신은 거센 파도를 미리 계산하고, 선원과 갑판을 정비해 질풍처럼 바다를 지배하는 겁니다. 위험을 감수하면서도 보물을 향해 나아가는 것, 그것이 바로 우리의 항해입니다.\n\n최재호 (Toss Place Leader)\n저는 해적정신을 이순신 장군의 거북선에 비유하고 싶습니다. 거북선은 빠르고 비정형적이며, 상식을 깨는 방식으로 적의 전열이 아닌 심장을 찔렀습니다. 우리도 그렇게 정공법을 벗어나 새로운 길을 파고듭시다.\n\n임한욱 (Toss Payments Leader)\n세상에 없던 우리만의 방식으로 모든 것을 헤쳐나가는 것, 그것이 제가 생각하는 해적정신입니다. 우리가 만들어가는 압도적인 이니셔티브와 함께라면 분명 가능하다고 믿습니다.\n\n조병익 (Toss Insurance Leader)\n제가 정의하는 해적정신은 목숨을 건 욕망 추구입니다. 될 때까지 던지고, 끝까지 가는 것. 혼자가 아니라 등을 맡길 수 있는 동료와 함께라면 어떤 바다에서도 나아갈 수 있습니다.\n\n신동훈 (Toss CX Leader)\n저의 해적정신은 가장 두려운 순간에 닻을 들어올리는 용기입니다. 위기 앞에서도 돛을 올리고, 더 빠르고 더 똑똑하게 항해를 시작하는 것. 그게 앞으로도 우리가 보여줄 해적정신입니다.\n\n해적정신이 빛난 순간\n\n커뮤니티데이 다음 날부터 각 계열사 곳곳에서 항해 일지가 펼쳐졌습니다. 일주일 동안 무려 113개의 러닝 쉐어 세션이 열렸고, 그 속에는 각 팀이 건져 올린 해적정신의 기록이 가득했습니다. 그중에서도 꼭 나누고 싶은 세션 4가지를 요약해서 소개할게요.\n\n정복이 아닌 개척\n— 토스코어 Commerce Domain 박웅도\n\n“토스 커머스는 ‘정복’이 아니라 ‘개척’을 선택했습니다. 이미 거대한 커머스 플랫폼이 존재하는 시장에서 똑같이 싸우는 건 답이 아니었죠. 대신 우리가 갈 수 있는 새로운 항로를 찾아 모험을 시작했습니다.\n우리가 이 모험에서 이루고 싶은 건, 사용자가 수많은 상품 속에서 ‘운명의 상품’을 만나는 경험이었습니다. 이를 위해 배를 전면적으로 고쳐야 했습니다. 우선 단순히 상품만 나열되던 기존 형태에서 벗어나, 피드 탐색을 기반으로 하는 화면으로 UX를 개편했습니다. 성과 보장 광고 상품을 만들어 트래픽을 수익으로 전환하기도 했습니다. 그리고 모든 지면을 카탈로그화해 사용자가 가격을 쉽게 비교하고, 결제도 보다 간편하게 할 수 있도록 했습니다.\n이렇게 배를 고치는 과정에서 우리는 Traffic = Revenue라는 공식을 직접 검증할 수 있었습니다. 이제 배도 튼튼하게 고쳤으니, 사용자에게 딱 맞는 상품을 추천하는 시스템을 제대로 만들고 적용하는 항해를 시작하려 합니다.\n물론 넘어야 할 난관은 여전히 많습니다. “토스답지 않은 디자인이다.”, “왜 토스에서 쇼핑을 하냐.”는 피드백도 직접 들었습니다. 하지만 변명 대신 개선을 택하겠습니다. 시스템과 디자인은 지속적으로 개편하고, 수만 명의 셀러와 함께 좋은 상품을 쌓아가겠습니다. 내부에서 오는 피드백에도 귀 기울이며 정면으로 마주하겠습니다. 그동안 경험할 수 없었던 새로운 커머스 서비스를 만들어보겠습니다. 정해진 길을 따르기보다, 유저의 즐거운 경험을 위해 나아가는 것. 그것이 바로 해적정신일 테니까요.”\n\nwow, who made this?\n— 토스인컴 Toss Income Product team 윤주승, 한다솜\n\n“토스인컴에게 5월은 가장 중요한 시즌입니다. 종합소득세 정기신고가 있는 달로서, 토스인컴의 대표 서비스인 숨은 환급액 찾기가 1년 중 가장 많이 이용되는 시기이기 때문이죠. \n토스인컴의 핵심 동력은 ‘환급 엔진’입니다. 저희는 시장에서 가장 정확한 환급 엔진을 만들어가고 있다고 자부해요. 때론 너무 정확하다 보니 타사보다 적은 환급액이 나오는 것처럼 보일 때도 있지만, 환급 신청 이후의 불편한 재확인과 수정 신고의 발생 가능성을 최소화하는 안전한 방식으로 구축했기 때문이에요. 특히 제품의 정확도와 안전성은 서비스의 신뢰와 직결되는 일이기 때문에, 가장 중요한 핵심 가치라고 생각하고 있습니다.\n그런데 아무리 좋은 환급 엔진을 갖췄다 해도 사용자가 오지 않으면 의미가 없겠죠. 그래서 최종 도착지인 ‘환급액 찾기’에 사용자를 데려오기 위해 17~20 개에 달하는 연계 제품을 내놓으며 사용 경험을 실험했습니다. 그리고 UX 라이팅·ML·디자인 챕터 등과의 협업을 통해 최적화된 이용 안내 메시지를 가장 유효한 고객군에게 전달해나갔죠.\n여기에 더해, 사용자 경험에 혁신을 불러올 수 있는 토스인컴 만의 시도에 대해 많이 고민하고 시도했습니다. 완전히 새로운 관점과 시도였기에 사전 검증의 어려움을 겪기도 했는데요. 당장의 결과가 나오지 않더라도 우리가 혁신이라고 믿으면 과감하게 시도해본다는 인컴 만의 해적 정신을 발휘하며 시도를 이어갔어요. 덕분에 환급 서비스의 끝판왕이라는 별명을 얻은 파격적인 기능인 ‘선정산/후결제’가 탄생할 수 있었습니다.\n이번 상반기의 치열했던 경험을 통해 얻은 인사이트는 심플합니다. 신뢰를 줄 수 있는 제품 본연의 가치 위에 유저를 위한 과감한 시도가 함께할 때, 높은 제품 성장과 고객 만족을 만들어낼 수 있다는 것 이었습니다.토스인컴의 다음 항해를 기대해주세요!”\n\n수신제가치국평천하\n— 토스플레이스 POS Home Team 김민주, 김태형\n\n“저희 팀이 올해 붙잡은 화두는 ‘수신제가치국평천하’였습니다. 스스로를 단단히 세우고 집안을 정리해야 나라를 다스릴 수 있듯, 포스홈이 바로 서야 토스포스* 천하를 평정할 수 있다고 믿었거든요. 그래서 지난 학기 포스 홈팀은 집을 바로 세우는 일에 집중했습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 토스플레이스가 만든 POS 시스템(매장 주문·결제·매출 관리 서비스)\n막상 집을 바로 세우려다 보니 고칠 게 정말 많았어요. 집을 지으면 10년 늙는다는 말이 실감될 정도로요. 기능이 부족하다는 사장님들의 의견, 홈 화면이 광고판처럼 복잡하다는 지적, 설치가 어렵다는 대리점의 아쉬움까지! 하지만 뚝딱뚝딱 하나씩 고쳐나갔습니다.\n우선 주방에서 주문을 한눈에 볼 수 있는 시스템을 비롯한 음식점에 꼭 필요한 핵심 기능들을 빠르게 채웠어요. 그리고 ‘포스 인텔리전스’라는 홍보 원칙을 명확히 세워 배너 영역을 깔끔하게 정리했죠. 설치와 세팅 과정도 최대한 쉽게 개편해서 사장님들이 대리점의 도움 없이 혼자서 할 수 있게 만들었어요. 다양한 개선 덕분에 이제는 사장님들과 대리점 모두 “토스 포스 덕분에 일이 편해졌다”는 피드백을 주고 계십니다.\n토스포스로 만난 사용자들을 토스 앱으로도 연결시켰어요. ‘나중에 적립 기능’을 통해 매장에서 적립을 놓치더라도 토스앱에서 다시 적립 할 수 있도록 하면서, 매장 고객과 토스 고객이 하나로 이어지는 경험을 만들 수 있었어요. 지금은 수천 개 매장에서 쓰이고 있고, 앞으로 토스포스의 CRM을 한 단계 도약시킬 토대가 되고 있어요.\n집을 잘 고쳤으니 이제 평천하를 향해 나아가야겠죠. 토스포스가 가야 할 위대한 항로는 막 시작되었습니다. ‘같은 깃발 아래에서 우리는 동료’라는 유명한 해적헌장이 있습니다. 앞으로 제휴사와 매장주들과 함께 연대하며 오프라인 비즈니스의 모든 순간을 연결하는 환경을 만들어 갈 거예요. 우리 모두 해적정신으로 단단히 무장했으니, 어떤 파도에도 흔들리지 않고 끝까지 항해할 거라 믿습니다.”\n\n아직도 할 게 있어요?\n— 토스증권 Community Silo 김유경, 최보금\n\n“토스증권 커뮤니티는 빠른 속도로 성장했습니다. 성장의 원동력은 좋은 글을 중심으로 한 ‘플라이휠’ 구조였습니다. 투자자들의 글이 팔로우와 재방문을 만들고, 다시 좋은 글을 낳는 선순환이 굴러가기 시작한 거죠.\n하지만 이 확장이 처음부터 쉬운 건 아니었어요. 종목 토론을 넘어 관심사별로 소통할 수 있는 ‘주제별 커뮤니티’를 출시했지만, 참여는 저조했거든요. 종목 커뮤니티 인기글을 모아보거나, 공식 엠버서더의 좋은 글을 추천탭에 노출시키며 노력했지만 반응은 약했습니다. 생각해보니 저희가 했던 시도들은 사용자와 사용자를 연결하는 게 아니라, 그저 하향식으로 콘텐츠를 전달하는 전통적인 방법이었어요.\n그래서 아예 새로운 시도를 시작해봤어요. 누구나 관심있을 주제를 유저의 글로 던지는 방법이었죠. 투자와 일상을 섞은 글, 투자자자라면 모두가 관심을 가지는 시사 이슈, 가볍게 웃을 수 있는 아무말 대잔치. 이런 콘텐츠에서 사용자들의 활발한 반응이 일어나기 시작했습니다. 그 덕분에 이제는 미국주식을 넘어 국내주식과 코인, 일상 이야기까지 아우르는 커뮤니티로 거듭날 수 있었죠.\n커뮤니티 그로스 루프를 만들기 위해 이제 콘텐츠를 통한 새로운 유저 획득이라는 마지막 퍼즐만 남았습니다. 저희는 유저들의 자발적 공유에서 기회를 발견했어요. 이 기회를 살리기 위해 약관을 개정해 UGC(사용자 생성 콘텐츠)를 외부로 확산할 수 있게 했어요. 이와 함께 광고·파트너십을 통한 배포 전략도 준비하고 있죠.\n이제 다음 학기의 목표는 명확합니다. 유저가 쓴 좋은 글로 계속해서 신규 유저를 불러오고, 팔로우로 재방문을 늘리며, 이를 다시 콘텐츠 투자로 연결하는 완벽한 커뮤니티 그로스 루프를 완성하는 것. 이를 통해 주식 커뮤니티 분야 세계 1위를 향해 나아가보겠습니다.”\n앞으로의 항해\n\n언제나 그랬듯 이번 학기에도 토스에는 수많은 도전이 있었습니다. 때로는 거친 파도를 맞고, 예상치 못한 암초에 부딪히기도 했지만, 그 과정에서 더 단단해질 수 있었어요. 가장 중요한 건 멈추지 않고 계속 유난하게 항해했다는 점이겠죠.\n해적정신이 테마였던 이번 얼라인먼트 기간 내내 <원피스(ONE PIECE)>의 밀짚모자 해적단을 떠올렸어요. 주인공 루피와 동료들은 강한 적을 만나 고전하면서도 결국 똘똘 뭉쳐 이겨내고, 위대한 항로를 나아갑니다. 어느덧 10년이 넘는 항해를 하고 있지만, 여전히 처음처럼 서로를 믿고 의지하며 강해지고 있는 토스 해적단. 앞으로도 우리는 더 큰 바다를 향해 나아갈 것입니다. 원피스를 찾는 그날까지요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",
