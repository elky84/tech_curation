        "content:encodedSnippet": "Microsoft C++ Code Analysis is a powerful static analysis tool integrated into Visual\nStudio that helps you identify and fix potential issues in your C++ code.\nLarge projects require effective management of analysis warnings to maintain code\nquality and you sometimes need to suppress warnings, but must do so in a clear and\nauditable way.\nTo that end, we are excited to announce significant updates to the warning suppression\nmechanisms in Microsoft C++ Code Analysis. These enhancements provide better tracking,\njustification, and overall management of warning suppressions, leading to a more\nmaintainable and robust codebase.\nWhat’s New in the SARIF Output?\nWe enhanced the\nStatic Analysis Results Interchange Format (SARIF)\noutput to include detailed information about warning suppressions, most notably the\njustification provided by you. This allows teams to easily review why a specific\nwarning was silenced.\nTo generate a SARIF file, use the /analyze:log:format:sarif compiler option. To ensure\nthat details about suppressed warnings (including their justifications) are included in\nthis SARIF log, you must also use the /analyze:log:includesuppressed option.\nWhat’s New in gsl::suppress?\nWe have updated our support for gsl::suppress to align with the latest C++ Core\nGuidelines syntax. Warnings can now be suppressed by using the gsl::suppress attribute\nin the following way:\n[[gsl::suppress( \"<warning_id>\", justification: \"<justification>\" )]]\nWhere <warning_id> is the ID of the warning you want to suppress, and the optional\n<justification> is a string that provides a justification for the suppression.\nFor now, [[gsl::suppress]] is only available for C++ codebases. For C codebases, you\nmust use the #pragma warning(suppress) syntax.\nExample:\n// CoreCheckExample.cpp\r\n// Add CppCoreCheck package and enable code analysis in build for warnings.\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int arr[10];           // warning C26494\r\n    int* p = arr;          // warning C26485\r\n\r\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"bounds.1\", justification : \"This attribute suppresses Bounds rules #1\")]]\r\n    {\r\n        int* q = p + 1;    // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n        p = q++;           // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\nWhat’s New in #pragma warning?\nWe have extended #pragma warning to support the justification field. Here is how\nyou can use it starting in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14:\n#pragma warning(suppress : <warning_id>, justification : \"<justification>\")\nWhere <warning_id> is the ID of the warning you want to suppress, and the optional\n<justification> is a string that provides a justification for the suppression.\nChoosing Between #pragma warning and gsl::suppress\nBoth #pragma warning(suppress) and [[gsl::suppress]] offer fine-grained control over\nwarning suppression.\n#pragma warning(suppress) is a general MSVC mechanism that can be used for any\ncompiler warning. It’s particularly useful when you need to suppress a warning in a\nspecific code block without altering the code’s structure significantly.\n[[gsl::suppress]] will only suppress warnings emitted by Microsoft C++ Code\nAnalysis. It is intended for use with the C++ Core Guidelines checks and can be applied\nto a scope or a specific declaration.\nWhenever possible, we recommend using [[gsl::suppress]] for suppressing Microsoft C++\nCode Analysis warnings.\nWhy These Updates Matter\nThese enhancements to warning suppression offer several key benefits:\nImproved Auditability and Review: With justifications recorded directly in the\ncode and optionally in SARIF logs, code reviews become more effective. Team members can\nquickly understand the rationale behind a suppression without needing to consult\nexternal documentation or the original author.\nEnhanced Code Maintainability: Clear justifications prevent accidental\nre-introduction of issues when code is refactored or suppressions are reviewed. They\nprovide a history of why certain warnings were deemed acceptable at a particular point.\nBetter Management of Technical Debt: Suppressed warnings can be a form of\ntechnical debt. Justifications help in tracking and prioritizing which suppressions\nshould be revisited and potentially fixed.\nConsistency Across Suppression Mechanisms: By adding justification support to both\n#pragma warning and gsl::suppress, we provide a consistent experience for you. This\nallows old code to use #pragma warning while new code can use [[gsl::suppress]], all\nwhile maintaining the ability to provide justifications.\nImpact on Existing Workflows\nThese new features are additive. Existing suppression mechanisms (without\njustifications) will continue to work as before. However, we encourage you to\nstart using the justification attribute for new suppressions and to gradually update\nexisting ones where clarity is beneficial. There is no automatic migration, but the\nprocess of adding justifications is straightforward.\nAvailability\nThese enhancements are available in the MSVC compiler toolset shipping with Visual\nStudio 2022 version 17.14 and newer, and will be part of future Visual Studio releases.\nEnsure your Visual Studio is updated to leverage these improvements.\nTry It Out\n// example.cpp\r\n// Compile with: cl /analyze:only /analyze:plugin EspxEngine.dll /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed example.cpp\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    int arr[10];           // warning C26494\r\n    int* p = arr;          // warning C26485\r\n\r\n    [[gsl::suppress(\"bounds.1\", justification : \"This attribute suppresses Bounds rules #1\")]]\r\n    {\r\n        int* q = p + 1;    // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n        p = q++;           // warning C26481 (suppressed)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\nYou can run the above code with the following options:\n/analyze /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed to generate a SARIF\nfile that includes the suppression details.\n(Note: EspxEngine.dll is the plugin that enables C++ Core Guidelines checks, which are\nthe target of gsl::suppress.)\n> cl /analyze:only /analyze:plugin EspxEngine.dll /analyze:log:format:sarif /analyze:log:includesuppressed .\\example.cpp\r\nMicrosoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.50.35305.95 for x64\r\nCopyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Meta has developed an open-source AI tool to design concrete mixes that are stronger, more sustainable, and ready to build with faster—speeding up construction while reducing environmental impact.\nThe AI tool leverages Bayesian optimization, powered by Meta’s BoTorch and Ax frameworks, and was developed with Amrize and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I) to accelerate the discovery of high-performance, low carbon concrete.\nMeta successfully deployed a concrete mix that was optimized with the AI tool at a data center construction site. Being open-sourced and freely available, the AI-tool could help increase the adoption and optimization of sustainable concrete mixes in the construction industry at large.\nLow carbon concrete solutions are essential for advancing our goal of net zero emissions in 2030. Concrete production is a major contributor to the embodied carbon emissions in data center construction and accounts for 8% of all global CO2 emissions, according to the World Economic Forum.\n\nConventionally, concrete is optimized for strength (28-day compressive strength) and cost. But modern constructions – including data centers – require concrete that is optimized for sustainability, curing speed, workability, and finishability as well. \nInnovation in concrete formulations is difficult and slow. Compared to traditional concrete, current formulas for low carbon concrete face several challenges: slower curing speeds, issues with surface quality, and complications in supply chains when novel materials are involved.\nBut concrete suppliers can utilize AI to develop and scale innovative concrete mixes as drop-in replacements, accelerating the discovery and integration of sustainable materials for large-scale use.\nBy collaborating with Amrize — one of the world’s largest cement manufacturers and major concrete suppliers — and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (U of I), we’ve developed an AI model and pipeline to accelerate the discovery of new concrete mixtures that meet traditional requirements alongside newer sustainability needs.\nOur work with Amrize and U of I has already resulted in the successful design and deployment of AI-designed green concrete at our new data center in Rosemount, MN. \nMeta’s AI model for green concrete\nDesigning concrete formulas is a complex, multi-objective problem. The designer must choose between various types and proportions of cement, lower-carbon supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), water-to-binder ratios, coarse and fine aggregate types, and admixtures. SCMs’ impact on concrete performance varies by source location and seasonality, requiring long-term tests for validation. Finally, time-consuming tests taking days and weeks are needed to fully validate the performance of new mixes. Thus, it is important for the design process to be as efficient as possible. \nThere are several key ingredients often used in a sustainable concrete mix: \nCement is the “glue” that holds concrete together. It’s made from calcining limestone, clay, and other minerals in a high-temperature rotary kiln – the process which contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. The cement is then mixed with water, SCMs, aggregates, and admixtures at a ready mix plant to create concrete. When the cement paste hydrates and stiffens over time, it forms a hard, binding gel that gives concrete its strength.\nSlag is a byproduct of steel production. It’s a molten waste material that’s cooled and ground into a fine powder. In concrete, slag helps reduce concrete’s embodied carbon by replacing cement, and improves long-term strength, durability, and resistance to external chemicals.\nFly ash is a type of industrial by-product from coal-fired power plants. It’s collected from the air pollution control systems and can be used as a substitute for some of the cement in concrete. Fly ash helps reduce the embodied carbon in concrete by replacing cement, and also improves its long-term strength, durability, and workability.\nFine aggregate, like sand, is smaller than coarse aggregate and fills in the gaps between the larger rocks or gravel. Sand helps to create a smooth, even surface, and improves the overall texture of the concrete.\nCoarse aggregate refers to crushed stone or gravel that are added to concrete to provide bulk volume and load-bearing capacity, helping the concrete resist cracking and shrinkage.\nMixing these ingredients together in different proportions gives rise to concrete with varying strength and sustainability properties. The properties of each ingredient varies by origin and condition of manufacturing. Furthermore, some of the SCMs are declining in availability, necessitating the discovery and incorporation of novel materials for which little-to-no data is available. All of this adds to the challenges of concrete design. The goal of our approach is to optimize the trade-off between strength and sustainability.\nSeveral key ingredients used to generate concrete mixes, clockwise from top left: fly ash, coarse aggregates, fine aggregate, and cement.\nAn example of a low carbon concrete mix design, showing the relative amount of ingredients by weight.\nTo accelerate the concrete mix design process, Meta developed an AI model for sustainable concrete using BoTorch and Ax, Meta’s open-source software for Bayesian optimization and adaptive experimentation, respectively. This model uses multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithms to learn and optimize concrete compositions. The approach predicts compressive strength curves for different mixtures, optimizing short- and long-term strength properties and sustainability.\n(For technical details of the model and optimization algorithm, see our technical report, “Sustainable Concrete via Bayesian Optimization” and our open source SustainableConcrete repository with the associated data and code.)\nThe basis of the approach is a model that predicts the compressive strength curves associated with different concrete mixtures.\nThe figure below shows an example of two strength curve predictions, one associated with a concrete mix including pure portland cement (purple)—the most commonly used type of cement—and a second one where a part of the cement was substituted by fly ash (blue), whose carbon impact is lower than that of cement. We then leveraged the strength predictions at various times to jointly optimize the short- and long-term strength properties, as well as the sustainability of the associated mixes, to generate new formulas that can be validated through testing.\nBy using AI, we can accelerate the discovery process and drive efficiency in the experiment process.  \nTwo strength curve predictions carried out by our model during early development. The more sustainable mix (green) exhibits lower compressive strength early on but overtakes the traditional mix (blue) later on, a common trade-off of more sustainable concrete mixes.\nTo train this AI model with real data, we collaborated with Professor Nishant Garg and his research group at U of I. In each iteration, the AI suggests new promising concrete mixes based on performance predictions, which are updated with the latest data. We validated these predictions with lab testing and used the results to refine the AI for subsequent iterations. Our AI pipeline consists of the workflow of generating baseline data, training an AI model, using it to develop and validate new hypotheses, and then improving the baseline data and AI training.\nIn implementing the first AI pipeline, we focused on several key metrics: compressive strength, curing speed, slump, and sustainability, which we quantify using a proxy for the carbon footprint of the concrete mix. The compressive strength of concrete is crucial for determining both its long-term structural integrity, typically specified as its 28-day compressive strength, and its short-term curing speed, specified as the time needed to achieve certain strength requirements such as strength one, three, and five days after the pour. When densely sampled x-day strength data is available, a strength curve can be generated.\nThese attributes can be tested on concrete cylinders in the lab, allowing for rapid and systematic data generation necessary for training the AI. Larger-scale tests can be conducted after the new formulas, discovered through iterative testing, have been reviewed by concrete experts. By conducting research and development in stages, we can focus the AI on critical metrics and expedite progress.\nThe resulting AI pipeline is illustrated below:\nAdaptive experimentation steps to implement an AI pipeline.\nThe figure below shows how AI is able to learn and further optimize x-day strength versus sustainability (quantified using a proxy for the carbon footprint of the concrete mix) over several iterations, exceeding the initial human-designed formulas.\n\nOver time, this AI pipeline has generated high-quality data for AI training and development, containing over a hundred unique concrete mixes, comprehensive x-day compressive strength data, and global warming potential (GWP, measured in terms of kilograms of CO2 per cubic meter). \nDeveloping an AI pipeline for industrial green concrete\nIn 2024, we started collaborating with Amrize to explore how Meta’s AI can be used at scale in the concrete industry. \nAmrize shared basic concrete performance data, supporting Meta’s open source approach. They developed an AI pipeline at their batch plant near St. Paul, MN, extending the discovery and testing process.\nCritical to data centers are the concrete slabs that serve as surfaces for deploying servers and associated power and cooling equipment. Data center slabs to be flat, level, smooth, and durable to enable reliable servicing of the equipment that reside on it. Therefore, their concrete formulations must meet additional high-quality finish requirements. Our AI algorithms incorporate specific water-to-binder ratios and volumetric material constraints, and discover high-performing formulas with faster curing and lower GWP values that meet the stricter requirements.\nDistinguishing between formulas suitable for slabs, and those more suitable for other applications, we can compare their performance against industry standard formulas (see below). Within two iterations, and with minor human adjustments, the AI pipeline discovered formulas that exceeded standard low carbon industry formulas in terms of strength, speed, and sustainability.\nThe strength curves of standard industry low carbon formulas compared to AI-optimized formulas. AI-optimized formulas are faster, stronger, and have lower carbon emissions.\n\n\nApplying Amrize’s AI-designed concrete formulation at Meta’s Rosemount data center\nFurther testing is needed to apply AI-generated formulas in real-world applications. We therefore extended the first AI pipeline to incorporate additional steps and further tests, as shown in the figure below.\nAmrize collaborated with Mortensen, a general contractor responsible for the construction of our datacenter, to test the new formula’s workability and finishability. Successful slab tests led to at-scale application in a site support section in one of the data center building slabs at Meta’s Rosemount, MN data center project.\nThe development and scaling-up process to test and validate AI-generated concrete formulas. Human experts assess the outputs of each stage and iteration, refine the AI to incorporate additional constraints, and/or adjust individual constraints such as total binder amount and water-to-binder ratio.\nFormal tests show that the team exceeded all the technical requirements while achieving good workability and finish performance required for the application. \nClick to view slideshow.\nOpen source for more sustainable construction \nAt Meta, we believe AI can generate high-performance, low carbon concrete mixes for major construction projects such as data centers. Open source AI can benefit every level of the construction industry, from the construction companies and contractors, to suppliers, providers, architects, and, of course, building owners.\nWe will continue our collaboration with Amrize to further scale the use of AI in the concrete industry. The basic AI solution will remain open source to enable further commercial productization, application, and R&D. \nOur aim is to scale the use of low carbon concrete in data centers and encourage the adoption of performance-based requirements at minimum risk. Meta will continue to engage with other hyperscalers to collaboratively test and prove low carbon concrete formulas to further decrease carbon emissions. Meta will also leverage organizations such as iMasons and the Open Compute Project to publish reference designs, AI-informed formulas, case studies, and best practices.  \nLearn more about Meta’s AI for sustainable concrete\nDownload the sustainable concrete AI model on GitHub.\nRead our technical report, “Sustainable Concrete via Bayesian Optimization.”\nLearn more about BoTorch and Ax. \nRead more about how Meta uses low carbon concrete in our data centers.\nThe post Using AI to make lower-carbon, faster-curing concrete appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Android’s D8 tool, which converts bytecode to DEX  (Dalvik executable) format, only supports these backticked identifiers on Android 10 (API level 30) and newer.\n@Test\nfun `hello world returns 200`() = testApplication {\n    routing {\n        get(\"/hello\") {\n            call.respondText(\"Hello World!\")\n        }\n     }\n     val response = client.get(\"/hello\")\n     assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.status)\n}\nThis regression is fixed in Ktor 3.2.2. To prevent this from happening again, we’ve added new checks to our testing infrastructure. These tests continuously verify Ktor’s compatibility with essential Android tools, including D8 and ProGuard, ensuring new features don’t break support for older Android versions.

        "pubDate": "Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:00:54 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we care about Kotlin compiler quality. One powerful way to test it? Fuzzing, an approach that feeds programs unexpected, often random, inputs to uncover bugs that traditional tests may miss. It may sound chaotic, but it works, especially for complex software like compilers.\nIn a previous post, our colleagues introduced kotlinx.fuzz, a powerful tool for uncovering bugs in Kotlin programs.  As the Kotlin compiler is a Kotlin program, we can use fuzzing to test it, too.  In this post we will:\nExplain what fuzzing is and how it compares to traditional compiler testing techniques.\nShow how we applied it to the Kotlin compiler in collaboration with TU Delft.\nShare real bugs we caught and fixed, including in the new K2 compiler.\nCompiler fuzzing vs. traditional compiler testing techniques\nCompilers are essential to software development, as they transform the code we write into instructions that machines can read and then execute. Compilers are used not once, but multiple times throughout the whole software development stack. Without them you cannot compile your operating system kernel, your system library, or your JavaScript engine. Figure 1 points out where compilers are needed, underlining how crucial they are. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The importance of compilers in the software development stack.\nFigure 1 shows that compilers are not just an isolated development tool but are also needed to compile your source code in other places in the stack. This means that when something as important as a compiler contains bugs, it can cause bigger problems, such as:\nSecurity holes or vulnerabilities\nIncorrect code generation, subtly inconsistent with the original source code\nPerformance issues via mistriggered optimization\nCompiler crashes\nSo how do we ensure that compilers are free of errors? The rest of this section will outline some ways to detect bugs, starting with more traditional techniques and then moving on to fuzzing.\nUncovering bugs: Traditional techniques\nTraditional testing techniques focus on program behavior, namely, whether it produces correct output with valid input while properly handling any errors with invalid input. Table 1 lists some common methods.\n\nWhatHow\nUnit testsCheck individual components (e.g., lexer, parser, code generator)\nFunctional testsVerify that all compiler components behave as expected \nGold verification tests (regression tests)Compile a suite of known programs and compare compilation result to the expected output (i.e., gold standard)\nIntegration testsCheck whether compiler runs correctly with other tools or systems (e.g., build systems, linkers, or runtime environments)\nCross-platform testsTest compiler on different operating systems or platforms for consistency\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Traditional testing techniques.\nThese traditional techniques are essential for compiler development, but they may miss subtle bugs that only appear under specific circumstances. This is where advanced techniques like fuzzing can be more successful.\nFuzzing, or the art of breaking things to make them better\nAt its heart, fuzzing is based on a very simple idea: let’s throw a lot of random inputs at a program to see if it breaks. Long before fuzzing was adopted as a named technique, developers have been known to use a form of it. For example, programmers in the 1950s could test programs with a trash-deck technique: they input punch card decks from the trash or random-number punch cards to see when undesirable behavior might occur. \nWhile working on the Apple Macintosh in 1983, Steve Capps developed a tool to test MacWrite and MacPaint applications, which at the time were battling low memory conditions. Called The Monkey, it fed random events to an application and caused the computer (in this case, the Macintosh) to behave as if it were “operated by an incredibly fast, somewhat angry monkey, banging away at the mouse and keyboard, generating clicks and drags at random positions with wild abandon”. \nTo increase testing quality, Capps limited some random events, like menu commands, to a certain percentage, and later Bill Atkinson defined a system flag to disable commands such as quit, so the test could run as long as possible. Although the tool itself became obsolete when later Macintosh iterations freed up more memory, it is an important part of software testing history.\nThe term fuzzing is credited to Professor Barton Miller, who first experienced interference noise on a dial-up link when remotely logging into a Unix system during a storm in 1988. This noise caused the programs to crash, a surprise considering they were common Unix utilities. So that this effect could be explored more in depth, Miller then assigned his students a project to “evaluate the robustness of various Unix utility programs, given an unpredictable input stream”. One student group went on to publish a 1990 paper with Miller on their findings.\nFuzzing fundamentals\nIn contrast to carefully designed test cases like those in Table 1 above, fuzzing uses randomly generated inputs that can be unexpected or even deliberately nonsensical. The more diverse the inputs, the more likely the fuzzing tool (i.e., the fuzzer) will be to find unexpected issues.\nA fuzzer has three essential components: (i) an input data generator, which generates diverse inputs, (ii) the software under test (sometimes abbreviated as SUT), which processes these inputs, and (iii) a reference model, which produces the correct output from the same inputs. Both the software and the reference model produce outputs from the same inputs, and these outputs are compared to one another. Figure 2 depicts the relationship between the three components, the outputs to be compared, and the fuzzing result.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fuzzing basics.\nThe fuzzing result tells us whether or not the software performed correctly with the automatically generated input, as compared to the reference model with that same input. This process is repeated over and over, represented in the above image by multiple windows.  This repetition ensures that the inputs used for testing are sufficiently diverse. \nThe idea is to find inputs which cause the software to fail, either by crashing or producing incorrect results. It’s not so much about testing the intended functionality. That is, fuzzing investigates the edge cases of what the software can or cannot handle.\nCompiler fuzzing techniques\nSo far, we’ve covered the basic idea of fuzzing and a brief history of it. In this section, we will get more specific, starting with different ways to fuzz compilers.\nTwo fuzzing types that are more advanced are generative fuzzing, which constructs test programs from scratch based on grammar or specification of the target inputs, and mutation-based fuzzing, which starts with existing, valid, programs and modifies them to create new test inputs. Modifications (mutations) can include inserting, deleting, or replacing input parts. Table 2 lists pros and cons for each. \n\n\n\n\nTable 2: A comparison of generative and mutation-based fuzzing.\nFigure 3 further compares the two techniques to basic fuzzing, underlining their trade-offs on how well they cover different parts of the compiler vs. how deep they can explore it.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A comparison of fuzzing types.\nThis section has described fuzzing basics and how fuzzing is an effective method for ensuring a high standard in compiler quality. Going forward, we will focus on fuzzing the Kotlin compiler specifically.\nKotlin compiler fuzzing\nFuzzing is already a widespread practice for many programming languages, from C++ and JS to Java. At JetBrains, our Kotlin team is no stranger to fuzzing the Kotlin compiler. We have collaborated with external research groups to try to break the compiler with differing fuzzing approaches. One of the first collaborations gave us a great example of how to crash kotlinc using 8 characters and the main function. This is shown below.\nfun main() {\n    (when{}) // Crash in Kotlin 1.3, fixed in 1.5\n}\nYou can also access the example on Kotlin Playground in Kotlin 1.3 and Kotlin 1.5 versions, i.e., before and after the bug was fixed. The following code blocks contain two more examples of bugs found by fuzzing.\nfun <break> foo() // Compilation crash on type parameter named `break`\nfun box(){\n    foo()\n}\nThis example shows a compiler crash when it encounters a reserved identifier (such as break) in the position of a type parameter.\nfun box(): String {\n    return if (true) {\n        val a = 1 // No error when we are expected to return a `String`\n    } else {\n        \"fail:\"\n    }\n}\nfun main(args: Array<String>) {\n    println(box())\n}\nThe above example shows a miscompilation of when the compiler failed to reject an incorrect program: the if expression should return a String, but the true branch does not return anything.\nFigure 4 displays an incomplete trophy list of found-by-fuzzer bugs, demonstrating fuzzing’s usefulness. Many of the reported bugs greatly helped us in the K2 compiler stabilization.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Incomplete trophy list of found-by-fuzzer bugs.\nEvolutionary generative fuzzing\nLast year, we collaborated with TU Delft’s SERG team to more rigorously explore the properties of generative fuzzing. In this 2024 paper, we looked at generative fuzzing as an evolutionary algorithm problem and developed a fuzzing approach: Evolutionary Generative Fuzzing. This subsection will describe our approach in more detail.\nFirst, let’s break down the term evolutionary generative fuzzing. As discussed above, generative fuzzing is a bottom-up approach to creating program inputs, generating them following a specific set of rules. In the present case, the generation rules are based on the language syntax, or the Kotlin grammar, and its semantics, or the Kotlin specification. \nThe term’s evolutionary part comes from evolutionary algorithms, an approach that simulates the real evolutionary process. Evolutionary algorithms and a common subtype, genetic algorithms, are optimization techniques that use natural selection and genetic inheritance principles for solving complex problems in programming. \nFirst we will talk about the basic concepts of a genetic algorithm, then we will apply these concepts to fuzzing. Essentially, these types of algorithms are meant to mimic the way living organisms evolve over generations to adapt and survive in their environments. Figure 5 depicts this cycle.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Genetic algorithm cycle.\nAs a problem-solving technique, a genetic algorithm starts with a specific problem, and for this problem there are multiple candidate solutions. Each solution represents an individual (sometimes called chromosome), which could be,  for example, a specific input for a function. A set of individuals represents a population, just like in the natural world. \nTo begin the algorithm, an initial population must be generated, typically a set of random individuals (i.e., candidate solutions). After the initial population is generated,  a fitness function evaluates the suitability of each individual within the population, only retaining those individuals most the most fit to move on to the next generation. Then, the set of fit individuals mutate and recombine to form a  new population. This new  combination of individuals make up the next generation’s population.\nLet’s apply this to our Kotlin compiler fuzzing approach, represented in the more specialized version of the evolutionary cycle in Figure 6. The lighter-colored and smaller rectangles attached to the larger ones represent the relevant action needed to reach each stage. \n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Genetic algorithm in the evolutionary generative fuzzing approach.\nTo begin, the individuals are Kotlin code snippets created with generative fuzzing. To create the initial population, we sample multiple code snippets, which are then evaluated by a fitness function. And to simulate reproduction, we split each snippet into code blocks, where each block represents an individual’s chromosome. These code-block chromosomes then mutate and recombine to create new code snippets, which are sampled to create the next generation’s population. An important takeaway of the approach is: \nThe evolutionary generative fuzzer is not purely generative: it is also partially mutation-based.\nAs mentioned above, a fitness function plays an integral part in the evolutionary cycle. In this work we hypothesized that structurally diverse code is more likely to exercise different compiler components than more uniform code; by stressing various compiler components, more bugs will be able to be uncovered. To test this, we investigated a baseline and two different ways to calculate the fitness function, with both being attempts to optimize the sampled code’s diversity.\nAs a baseline, our approach used what is called random search (RS), as it samples programs without any fitness function. We also used different measures of diversity realized through the fitness functions to apply two novel types of genetic algorithms (GAs): single-objective and many-objective functions for the single-objective diversity GA (SODGA) and many-objective diversity GA (MODGA), respectively. The details of these two genetic algorithms and the baseline are summarized in Table 3.\n\nTable 3: Approaches and their fitness-function details.\nThe generated code was then compiled with both the original K1 compiler and the new K2 compiler released with Kotlin 2.0. This allowed us to focus on K1-to-K2 changes and find situations when the new compiler introduces regressions or unexpected behavior changes.\nApplying any approach listed in Table 3 results in finding interesting bugs, and the different approaches complement each other in terms of bug-detecting categories: random search (RS in Table 3) is effective for detecting more straightforward differential bugs such as out-of-memory errors and resolution ambiguity, whereas the two genetic algorithms (SODGA and MODGA in Table 3) are successful in detecting nuanced problems such as with conflicting overloads, shown in the code example below.\nfun main() {\n    fun p(): Char { return 'c' }\n    fun p(): Float { return 13.0f }\n}\nThe intended behavior of the above code block is that the compiler reports a conflicting overloads error, as the two p functions should cause a resolution conflict. The K1 compiler returns the appropriate error, while the K2 compiles the code without any warning. By applying two types of genetic algorithms, we were able to uncover several independent instances of this bug, and we fixed this error in Kotlin 2.0.\nOverall, our team’s complex approach to Kotlin compiler fuzzing has led to the discovery of previously unknown bugs. In combining both generative and mutation-based fuzzing, we have been able to enhance bug discovery.\nThe future of fuzzing\nFuzzing has already enabled our team to find and fix many compiler bugs, improving the Kotlin compiler. Our research collaboration with TU Delft’s SERG team produced a more advanced approach to fuzzing, combining generative and mutation-based methods, and with this foundation we can fine tune fuzzing even more.\nFuzzing is an active field of research with many opportunities for advancement, and fuzzing a complex, industrial language like Kotlin presents unique challenges that require careful attention for the advancement of fuzzing, as well as for the results to be useful. These challenges and their possible solutions are listed in Table 4.\n\nChallengePossible solution\nMaintaining code validity, with code that is both syntactically correct and semantically meaningful. Often requires fuzzer implementation to include parts tailored to target language.Custom handwritten generators for more complicated parts of Kotlin\nFinding different types of bugs and thoroughly testing all compiler parts to ensure good compiler code coverage.Coverage-guided fuzzing: one component of the fitness function is X if a code snippet reaches so far unexplored compiler parts\nAfter finding bugs, localizing faults by determining the exact cause and the code responsible. Fuzzers often produce large amounts of test cases, which require manual analysis.  MOGDA, as it naturally prefers generating smaller and easier-to-understand programs \nA good fuzzer needs to be able to avoid duplicates and instead trigger new, unique bugs, instead of the same bugs repeatedly.For now, this problem is solved manually, but there are different possibilities to do this automatically\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4: Fuzzing challenges and possible solutions.\nOur Kotlin compiler team continues to address these challenges by improving fuzzing capabilities in an incremental fashion. We want to keep on providing you with reliable software, and that includes reducing distractions so that you can focus on having fun while developing in Kotlin!\nMore fuzzing resources\nCurious to explore the research or try out fuzzing on your own Kotlin code?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are excited to announce the next step for IntelliJ IDEA: we are moving to a single, unified distribution. And yes, before you ask, our commitment to open source remains as strong as ever.\nThere will be just one IntelliJ IDEA installer, replacing the separate downloads for Community Edition and Ultimate Edition. In this new setup, all Ultimate features will still require a subscription to unlock. But even without a subscription, the IDE will remain fully functional, free to use for both commercial and non-commercial projects, and will include more features than the current Community Edition ever had.\nIn this article, we will walk you through the actual transition plan, what it means for your day-to-day development (spoiler: we expect it will only improve your experience), why we are making this change, how we are continuing to support open source, and other questions you might have about the new unified distribution.\nThe Plan for Transition\nThe move to a unified distribution will happen in several steps to ensure a smooth and transparent experience for all users. Here is how the transition will unfold and what it means for you. It will include three steps illustrated in the picture below.\n\nEnabling CI/CD Pipelines and Open Source Builds on GitHub\nWe are making it easier than ever to build IntelliJ IDEA from source. To support open-source workflows and improve transparency, we will begin publishing open-source builds directly to GitHub Releases. These builds will include only the open-source components, as outlined in the More Details About Open Source section below.\nWe are also introducing ready-to-use CI/CD pipelines powered by GitHub Actions. With just a few steps, anyone can fork the project and produce a working build from the source.\nThis step is entirely non-intrusive and won’t affect your day-to-day workflow.\nIntroducing a Graceful License Expiration Experience\nStarting with IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2, we are updating the licensing experience for Ultimate users. If your subscription expires, you won’t be locked out of the IDE. Instead, you will continue to have access to the full IDE, but with the feature set matching what is available for free (previously known as Community Edition).\nThis means your work will not be interrupted, even if your subscription lapses while you are on vacation or between renewals. You will still be able to open your projects, write code, and stay productive.\nThis step affects only users of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and ensures a better experience in case of license expiration.\nMigrating to the Unified Distribution\nWith the 2025.3 release, IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition will no longer be distributed as a separate product. Instead, all users will download a single IntelliJ IDEA distribution: one installer and one update stream.\nIf you are currently using Community Edition, your IDE will automatically update to the unified distribution via the usual patch update process. You will get access to additional features at no cost and a more seamless experience. You will also be able to try Ultimate features with just one click.\nThe change is minimal for Ultimate users: the IDE will simply be called IntelliJ IDEA without the “Ultimate” suffix.\nThe Way to Single Distribution\nWhen we introduced IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition in 2009, it was an important milestone — not only for the IDE, but also for JetBrains as a company. For the first time, we opened the source code of our IDE and provided a full-featured Java development environment for free. It was a bold step, and looking back, one of our best. We remain proud of it!\nThe Community Edition became the foundation of our open-source efforts. It enabled millions of developers to start using IntelliJ IDEA and helped build a strong ecosystem of contributors, plugin creators, educators, and learners. For many, it was their first introduction to Java or Kotlin programming and IntelliJ IDEA.\nOver time, though, the boundary between open-source and proprietary components blurred. Today, even the Community Edition includes some functionality that is not open source. This was never the original intention. These additions have been made gradually, one by one, to support real user needs. After years, they reached a critical mass that introduced inconsistency in what the “Community Edition” name was originally given to.\nOne of our longstanding goals has always been to provide a smooth “out-of-the-box” experience. That is what we continue to build. With the move to a single distribution, we want to honestly reflect the reality of what IntelliJ IDEA has become: a single, complete IDE that delivers the best experience for professional development with Java and Kotlin. It is powerful. It is free. It becomes even more capable with an Ultimate subscription. Its core remains open source, but it also includes functionality that, for business reasons, cannot be open-sourced.\nA Variety of Problems Solved with the Unified Distribution\nThere have been a number of other reasons for moving to a single distribution. Each reflects our long-term goals: delivering better quality, simplifying the user experience, and making IntelliJ IDEA more accessible to everyone.\nFewer versions mean better quality. Maintaining separate Community and Ultimate builds has always required parallel testing, validation, and packaging. By unifying the distribution, we can streamline development and focus our efforts more effectively, leading to faster iteration, fewer inconsistencies, and higher overall quality.\nLess confusion for educators and students. Many educators have told us that managing multiple versions creates friction in the classroom. It is not always clear which edition to install or what to do when a trial expires. With a unified distribution, we can offer a simpler setup for teaching and learning. It is also worth highlighting that IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate has always been free for students and classroom use, and we remain committed to supporting the academic community. We will continue to improve how educators and students access the full power of IntelliJ IDEA for educational purposes.\nFree can go beyond open source. While our commitment to open source remains unchanged, not all features can be open-sourced. However, we still want more developers to benefit from them. With this change, some previously Ultimate-only features will now be available for free, even though they remain proprietary. We believe that “free to use” should not be limited to “open-source only.”\nEasier access to premium features. Trying out IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate should be simple. The unified distribution removes friction from the trial experience, letting developers explore premium functionality without switching installers or environments.\nMore Features Available for Free, Ensuring a Great Experience for Every Java and Kotlin Developer\nThroughout our journey, we have always felt a strong responsibility to support developers just starting out — those who need to explore different frameworks without additional barriers. By unlocking the following features for free, we aim to remove obstacles for those beginning their professional development.\nCode highlighting beyond basic language support is essential for clear, readable code, especially when learning a new framework or language. Now, IntelliJ IDEA, with no subscription, provides syntax highlighting for popular frameworks like Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Micronaut, JPA (JPQL/HQL), templating engines such as Thymeleaf, Velocity, FreeMarker, and JSP, Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, and finally, non-JVM languages.\nQuick project setup is crucial for getting started quickly. In the unified distribution of IntelliJ IDEA, the list of wizards for setting up a new project will be extended for Spring, Jakarta EE, Quarkus, Micronaut, and Ktor. We will look into bringing more support for non-JVM languages in the future.\nDatabase schema exploration helps you visualize and understand your database structure more clearly. In the unified distribution, IntelliJ IDEA lets you connect to your database and view its schema (tables, columns, indexes) directly within the IDE, even without a subscription. While you won’t have access to data or SQL execution without a subscription, this feature offers a beginner-friendly view of your database design.\nFor developers looking for advanced tools and ultimate development comfort, IntelliJ IDEA offers powerful features like smart framework support, AI-assisted coding (available for all product pack subscribers or requires an additional AI subscription), remote development, advanced database tools, seamless polyglot experience, diagramming tools, UI test frameworks, a powerful profiler, HTTP Client, and more. These features will remain available to subscribers only, but with the unified distribution, everyone can try them easily with a one-click trial.\nMore Details About Open Source\nAs mentioned, our commitment to open source is as strong as ever. We will keep the open-source parts of the IntelliJ IDEA codebase on GitHub up to date and open for everyone. This codebase powers not only IntelliJ IDEA but also other well-known products like Android Studio, HCL Volt MX Iris, and Adobe AEM Developer Tools, as well as many internal tools in various companies used by developers every day. We take full responsibility for making sure these tools stay reliable and future-proof.\nTo make it easier for the community to use and contribute, we will provide CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), so anyone can build their own version from the source code. We will also start publishing open-source builds directly on GitHub, so you will be able to download and use them right away without setting up a build environment.\nThese builds will include only the open-source parts, just like the original Community Edition. Effectively, that means that GitHub builds will not include the following features:\nBackup and Sync — synchronizes your IDE settings and plugins across different machines using your JetBrains account\nPackage Checker — scans dependencies to reveal known security vulnerabilities\nAI ranking for code completion and search everywhere — improves output sorting for code completion and search everywhere\nAI Assistant — provides powerful AI support in JetBrains IDEs\nQodana plugin — maintains high code quality and compliance through static code analysis\nLocalization plugins (Japanese, Korean, Chinese) — translate IDE UI into multiple languages\nKotlin Notebook — enables interactive notebooks for Kotlin, targeting exploratory coding and data science tasks\nWSL capabilities — unlocks development in a real Linux environment while using Windows\nCode With Me — provides collaborative capabilities for real-time development\nHowever, most of these features, except WSL support, will be available as free plugins on the JetBrains Marketplace. So, if you would like to tailor your own IntelliJ IDEA setup, you will be able to manually install plugins you find useful. And they will always be available for free as part of the unified IntelliJ IDEA.\nFor the open-source builds, there will be no in-product update, new versions will be published on GitHub and can be downloaded from there.\nChanges to plugin development\nThe move to a unified distribution will introduce changes for plugin developers. These changes will only apply to plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later versions. We’ll provide additional details in a dedicated post closer to the start of the 2025.3 Early Access Program.\nConclusion\nWe are happy to continue delivering the professional tools you love. With this move to a single, unified distribution, we hope to make IntelliJ IDEA even better — higher quality, more features, and no more confusion over which version to download. Our commitment to open source remains as strong as ever: the Community Edition will stay fully available on GitHub, complete with CI/CD pipelines and nightly builds.\nWe hope all our users, from students and newcomers to seasoned enterprise gurus, will benefit from these changes.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At AI Summit London 2025, Kris Kang, Head of Product for AI at JetBrains, gave a talk that questioned a common belief in AI development: that bigger means better.\nThe industry has focused heavily on massive, general-purpose language models. These models offer impressive capabilities, but the cost of building and running them at scale is top of mind for many enterprise decision-markers.\nIn his talk “Small Models, Big Impact”, Kris introduced an alternative: focal models. These compact, domain-specific LLMs aim to deliver strong performance while reducing energy use and total cost of ownership. These models can be used as a workhorse complement to frontier models.”\nHere’s why this matters and how JetBrains is acting on it.\nThe energy cost of chasing scale\nAI models now operate at a scale that was hard to imagine a few years ago. Although there are no official numbers, observers estimate that GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters, while estimates place GPT-4 at 1.8 trillion and Grok-3 at 2.7 trillion. To accommodate the growing size of models, data centers with as much as 2 million GPUs are being built.\nThe energy required for this is significant. Processing 1 billion AI chats, with a frontier model, can use more than 124 GWh per year (at 0.34 Wh per day), or equivalent to powering 31k UK households per year. The environmental impact alone raises important concerns, and the financial cost can be just as significant.\nFor a mid-sized company, using a frontier model daily might cost around USD 15,000, which adds up to USD 45,000 per employee per year. That figure is six times higher than the average IT expenditure per employee in 2023. This assumes: $15 per 10 requests, and an enterprise of 1,000 makes 10,000 requests per day, then that’s $15,000 per day. This is a conservative estimate.\nWhat are focal models?\nFocal models aim to solve a single problem with scalability in mind. They are:\nSmall, usually with fewer than 10 billion parameters\nDomain-specific, not general-purpose\nPost-trained to maximise cost efficiency and inference speed\nBuilt using techniques like quantisation, distillation, and Mixture of Experts techniques\n\n\n\n\n\nRather than trying to be good at everything (generating images, text-to-speech, coding, and more) they focus on high performance in a narrow field, such as code, legal, or medical tasks.\nThis specialisation allows enterprises to apply focal models to specific use cases that have the highest ROI per cost, where ROI might also include energy efficiency.\nMellum: A focal model purpose-built for code\nJetBrains has taken this concept and is applying it directly to software development. Mellum, our 4-billion-parameter model, is the first in a family we intend to open source. It was built from the ground up to support code completion in real-world settings.\nMellum works across multiple programming languages and has been optimized to run quickly on modest hardware (e.g. it can run locally easily on a Macbook M4 Max). Developers can use it in isolated environments without relying on third-party providers and without giving up control over their data. You can already access Mellum through JetBrains IDEs via our AI Assistant or on Hugging Face if you prefer to run it independently.\nRather than aiming for general use, Mellum stays focused on one job: helping developers write better code more efficiently.\nWhy focal models matter for the future of AI\nFocal models offer a practical answer to AI’s rising technical, financial, and environmental costs.\nBy narrowing the model’s purpose, teams can work with systems that cost less to operate and offer greater flexibility in how and where they’re deployed.\nThis also opens the door to deeper enterprise integration. Companies can fine-tune these models to fit their workflows or adapt them to meet compliance requirements without needing access to large-scale computeing clusters.\nFocal models do not replace frontier models but offer a complement that better suits many real-world applications.\nThe JetBrains perspective: Smarter, not just bigger\nJetBrains believes the next meaningful shift in AI will not come from chasing larger models but from refining how and where we apply them in order to help companies grow their businesses sustainably. We have invested in focal model development because our customers are asking for it, and we believe this approach delivers more balanced results.\nMellum is our first step in this direction. It shows what is possible when you focus on purpose instead of size.\nTry Mellum today\nYou can try Mellum in several ways:\nOn Hugging Face, for experimentation or offline use\nInside JetBrains IDEs, through AI Assistant\nSoon, as a containerised deployment in NVIDIA AI Enterprise\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you prioritise sustainability, performance, or security, focal models like Mellum offer a practical way to adopt LLMs where they bring the most value.\nThe future of AI is not just about using frontier models as they hit the market, it’s about sustainably embedding AI to your business that leads to positive outcomes.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI is no longer a distant idea. It’s already here and changing how we build software. As it advances, new questions emerge about its impact. \nHow deeply will AI be woven into software development? What new opportunities will emerge for companies building AI-powered tools? Perhaps most importantly, how will developers and AI collaborate over the next three to five years?\nThe AI 2027 outlook highlights the need for practical use, domain-specific design, and a focus on real results over hype.\nIn this article, we’ll offer insights into how AI is transforming the development landscape today and its potential impact on software development over the coming decade. Here’s an in-depth look at the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for developers and organizations.\nTwo possible futures\nWe’ll explore two potential timelines for the future: one where AGI fundamentally reshapes software development, and another where AI merely enhances our current practices.\nHere’s a quick recap of the trends we’ll have to stay on top of in order to know which future we’re headed toward:\nFirst off is the rise of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), where machines gain human-like cognitive abilities. OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has expressed confidence about AGI being right around the corner. However, experts like Meta’s Yann LeCun are more cautious, arguing that current systems remain far from that goal.\nAt Google I/O 2025, Google introduced Gemini 2.5 Pro with “Deep Think” reasoning, plus new tools like AI Mode for Search and Gemini Flow for video generation. \nAlternatively, AI is enhancing software development through advanced tools that assist developers in coding and problem-solving. Platforms like GitHub Copilot or JetBrains AI integrate models from various AI research organizations, allowing developers to choose the most effective AI assistance for their specific tasks. \nTools such as JetBrains Junie, Cursor Composer, Codex, or Windsurf Flows enable automating various tasks at the codebase level at a rate unimaginable before. This integration boosts productivity and democratizes coding.\nAs AI continues to evolve, the software development landscape stands at a crossroads between the pursuit of AGI and the augmentation of human capabilities through AI-powered tools.\nScenario 1: A full-blown AI future \nAs technology gets closer and closer to the level of AGI, we’re beginning to see AI agents that don’t just assist, but actively write code. These systems can handle complex engineering tasks, with capabilities approaching those of senior-level developers. Early examples include Devin, which can plan and execute full development workflows, and Honeycomb, which integrates autonomous agents into real-world software pipelines. In systems evaluation, progress is often measured using benchmarks like SWE-bench, which focuses on resolving localized GitHub issues. Taken together, these efforts mark the emergence of autonomous AI agents that we can call “AI developers”.\nWe can even imagine AI developers eventually working together in teams, much the same way humans do today, with each having its own specialized area (development, testing, project coordination, etc.). This idea is gaining traction in research. Examples include RepoAgent, which applies multiple agents to full-stack tasks in real repositories, and AgentCoder, which simulates collaborative agent roles throughout the software workflow.\nAI developers need a home, too\nAI developers will demand their own workspace ecosystem. This isn’t just a theoretical concept – it’s an immediate challenge facing organizations integrating AI into their development workflows.\nThis evolution will unfold naturally over the next few years, from enhanced ML capabilities in enterprise environments to fully customizable AI developer solutions. For some AI developers, this “home” may exist within centralized cloud-based platforms.\nFor others, local inference offers an alternative path. Tools like Ollama already allow powerful models to run directly on consumer hardware. With quantization, even 30B+ parameter models can run locally on high-end GPUs, opening the door to secure, offline-first AI development environments. Organizations that recognize and adapt to this shift early will gain a meaningful edge on the AI-driven development landscape.\nAI teams need tools\nAs teams of AI developers (let’s call them “AI teams”) become more advanced, they’ll need specialized tools to manage every part of their workflow, from coding and testing to handling documentation and requirements. The AutoCodeRover team was among the first to show how advanced tools make it far easier for agents to solve problems. Since then, we’ve seen an uptick in environments and platforms for AI developers: hide, OpenHands, and others. AI teams rely on robust, integrated platforms, just like humans do.\nThe ultimate breakthrough would be a platform that gives AI models direct, seamless access to all the essential tools in one centralized space. This setup would allow AI developers to operate as smoothly as human developers within a single interface by eliminating the need for complex integrations. \nEarly efforts in this direction include OpenAI’s Computer-Using Agent (CUA), which enables models to interact with existing software on a desktop, and Anthropic’s ComputerUse, which gives Claude the ability to control full computing environments. \nBoth approaches reflect a shared goal: equipping AI developers with the same types of digital toolkits that humans use.\nHumans need next-generation IDEs to collaborate with AI teams \nEven with AI teams doing the heavy lifting, we’ll still need humans to guide, refine, and approve the final product. Next-generation IDEs will be essential for this, bridging the gap between human insight and AI productivity.\nIn fact, there’s an entire new field of study emerging, known as Human-AI eXperience (HAX). This field is all about finding efficient ways for human developers to interact with their AI tools. Soon enough, we’ll be faced with a flood of AI-generated code, and we’ll need IDEs that can understand and verify this code for us, while we humans stay focused on the big picture stuff (setting requirements, visualizing project progress, etc.).\nAt JetBrains, we’re exploring more effective ways for humans to collaborate with AI systems, including ongoing experiments like AIR. We’re staying on top of broader developments in this space, and view tools like Claude Code, Warp AI, Gemini CLI, Google Jules, Cursor, Coedium, and DevGPT as strongly indicative of how the landscape is shifting.\nAI teams need a marketplace\nAs AI developers produce more code, they’ll need a dedicated marketplace – a central hub for storing, finding, and reusing AI-generated code (like GitHub for AI agents).\nExisting platforms aren’t built for this use case. They assume human intent, manual review, and slow feedback cycles. An AI-first marketplace would need different foundations, like built-in sandboxing to safely test unknown contributions, automated verification pipelines to check compatibility and quality, and metadata designed to help AI developers understand, rate, and select what they need.\nWithout these features, reuse becomes risky and inefficient. With them, AI teams can move faster, collaborate safely, and continuously improve shared assets.\nAI will face regulations \nThe AI learning curve isn’t specific to developers. Lawyers and policymakers will also have to learn the ropes.\nThe first problem is safety. Obviously AI is not immune to making mistakes, and these mistakes can cause real-world damage. Studies have shown that trustworthy AI code may be a long way off. For the foreseeable future, we should be treating AI-generated code with the same scrutiny that we apply to, say, self-driving cars. Formal audits and certifications are a must.\nSecondly, the prevalence of AI may raise new questions about intellectual property and its definitions. For example, when we use publicly available code to train models, are we infringing on the rights of the original authors? Recent lawsuits, such as those involving GitHub Copilot and Open AI, force us to ask this question. Attribution and licensing will only become more complex as AI generates code at scale.\nThis creates a major opportunity for companies that develop tools to inspect and certify AI-generated code. Tools that can identify AI-created code, flag potential risks, and approve it will protect users and build trust.\nSoftware may look different from the inside \nAI developers could end up training themselves, learning and evolving their coding patterns through countless iterations of trial and error. Early work in this direction appeared in 2022, including projects like CodeRL, which applied reinforcement learning to optimize code generation based on execution feedback. While the code might still be written in familiar languages like Java or Kotlin, its structure could be optimized entirely for machine efficiency, not human readability.\nAn even more frightening thought is that we could end up with new programming languages that don’t follow any of the patterns we humans are familiar with, as they were designed entirely for AI developers. This isn’t science fiction – it’s the next frontier in software development, where AI might write code that is essentially unrecognizable to us.\nAs Erik Meijer outlines in his ACM article, we may soon need to accept a world where code serves machines first, with humans relying on meta-tools to inspect and tweak the output. The result? Faster, more efficient business systems, even if we need new abstractions to understand what’s going on under the hood.\nSoftware may look the same, but with AI developers choosing their favorites \nIn the AI era, a language’s success might depend more on its available codebase than its elegant syntax. It’s simple math – the more code examples available, the better AI can understand that language and generate code in it.\nThis creates a unique opportunity to position programming languages for AI adoption. The goal isn’t to replace programming languages, but to develop them for this new collaborative future. \nLanguages like Rust, with strong memory safety guarantees, or Dafny, which supports formal verification, offer valuable properties in contexts where reliability matters. Others, like Julia, scale well for numerical and data-heavy tasks, making them attractive for AI workflows. The race to become AI’s preferred programming language is just beginning.\nThe legacy code challenge\nLet’s talk about the elephant in the room: legacy code. While everyone’s excited about AI generating new applications, there’s a trillion-dollar reality we can’t ignore. We have a massive amount of code powering our world, and it’s not going anywhere.\n\n\n\n\nThe real opportunity here lies in creating smart maintenance solutions that can handle enterprise-scale challenges. Some examples are tools that can help modernize legacy codebases, automatically suggest library updates, and provide deep insights across millions of lines of code. \nScenario 2: AI as an enhancer\nIn this more conservative vision of the future, AI doesn’t replace developers, but supercharges their work and transforms the toolkit they rely on. Developers remain firmly in control, and AI merely helps their productivity skyrocket.\nAdvancement in AI support beyond coding \nIn the future, activities like debugging, profiling, and configuring development environments are likely to become partially or fully automated. So far, automation has primarily focused on accelerating coding itself. The next generation of AI tools will likely handle a broader range of tasks, such as finding bugs and optimizing performance.\nHowever, even as these tasks are automated, human developers will still be critical in reviewing and verifying the AI’s work. The challenge will be creating tools that assist in these tasks and build trust, enabling developers to quickly confirm that the AI’s actions are correct and helpful.\nAI developers as part of human teams \nSoftware teams are already moving towards including AI as active contributors. We can see early signs in tools like GitHub bots that fix vulnerabilities without human input. Before long, AI agents could take on everyday tasks like resolving issues, updating documents, and tidying up codebases.\nThis shift lets developers spend more time on complex, creative work while AI handles the routine upkeep.\nIDEs adapted to work with AI developers \nThis shift is already underway. As AI joins development teams, human developers will need tools to manage these new digital teammates. That means assigning tasks, tracking progress, and reviewing output, all within the IDE.\nNew, user-friendly interfaces will help developers see what each agent is working on, check task lists, and respond to questions. As AI performs more updates and maintenance, these manager-style tools will become essential. Like any teammate, AI may also reach out for help when needed.\nAI assistants beyond development\nWhat if everyone involved in the development process (product managers, QA engineers, DevOps teams, and more) had their own AI helper? We seem to be headed in this direction already, with startups popping up to offer AI-powered assistance to roles outside traditional software engineering.\nThe end goal? Less time spent on routine tasks and more time for people to focus on strategic work, reviewing results, and making key decisions.\nThere’s a boatload of untapped potential for increased productivity here. Now is the time to start exploring what each professional needs from their AI assistant and get a few prototypes up and running. \nAI assistants as technical leads\nIt won’t be long before AI assistants can act as “tech leads”, ready to answer any question you have about your project. LLMs can already handle general questions and give insights on specific sections of code, but for now, only within the highly specific context presented by the prompt.\nAs these models evolve, they’ll be able to draw from the entire codebase, the project’s development history, issues from the tracker, team chats, and all documentation. \nAI needs control \nAs AI generates more and more code, we will need ways to keep track of it, verify its quality, and ensure it works as expected. Simply reviewing AI-generated code will not be enough to guarantee its reliability. One likely development is the introduction of Git-level tagging to mark code as AI-generated, making it easier to trace and manage throughout the lifecycle.\nThis is only part of the picture. We will also need tools designed specifically for testing and auditing code written by machines. Platforms like SonarQube are already evolving to support more automated quality checks, and efforts to build policy-aware validation frameworks are gaining traction.\nLooking ahead, companies working in this space may help shape how we standardize, track, and certify AI-generated code. Broader regulatory initiatives are also emerging, such as the EU AI Act and guidance from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), both of which emphasise transparency, accountability, and traceability as essential principles for responsible AI use in software development.\nAI-powered education\nAs AI reshapes development, our approach to teaching programming should keep pace. Imagine new devs learning not just to code, but to code in an AI-enhanced environment that mirrors real-world development. By integrating AI into programming education, we can help beginners adopt tools faster and more naturally, setting them up for success with the technologies they’ll use.\nWrapping up: An AI-powered future is inevitable \nWe’ve looked at current AI trends shaping software development and explored two vastly different AI-driven scenarios. Regardless of what the future holds, one thing is clear: AI will evolve from a supportive assistant into a proactive player in coding, testing, and analysis. This shift will create new roles for developers as guides and reviewers, collaborating closely with AI agents.\nAs AI automates more routine work and gains richer project context, we’ll need fresh interfaces, reliable verification tools, and adaptable workflows. Preparing for this future means advancing machine learning, experimenting with interfaces, and deepening AI integration. Thanks for joining us on this exploration!",

If you have editing access to the workspace where the original notebook lives, you won’t need to manually add environment variables, repositories, and data connections. This means less time spent configuring the setup and more time actually working with data.\nReport folders\nYou can now organize your reports in folders, making your insights and findings easier to maintain, collaborate on, and revisit later. You can keep drafts separate from polished reports, group reports by project, or use any other method that works for you and your team. Learn more.\n\n\n\n\nWorkspace import from ZIP\nIf you have a workspace in a ZIP archive, you can now import it in Datalore and add all notebooks and files at once instead of importing them manually one by one. If your workspace has been exported from Datalore, your original file structure will be recreated. Learn more.\n\n\n\n\n\n          \n      Update to 2025.3",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve just released Koog 0.3.0, which comes with many updates that make building, running, and managing intelligent agents easier.\nThis version focuses on durability, speed, observability, and smoother integration with real-world systems. If you’ve been exploring how to develop your own intelligent agent that can handle complex workflows, the new and updated Koog could be just what you’re looking for. Find it now on GitHub.\nHere’s a breakdown of what’s new in v0.3.0:\nLearn more\nAgents that don’t forget\nIn Koog 0.3.0, agents can now remember what they were doing. You can save and reload their state from a local disk, S3 buckets, or a database. This powerful feature enables server-side developers to build fault-tolerant agentic solutions by restoring the agent’s entire state machine at the exact point of strategy execution instead of just recovering the message history.\nThis means you can shut down machines without losing progress. There’s also a new checkpoint feature, so agents can roll back to any earlier state if needed.\n\nSmarter storage for better retrieval\nKoog now supports persistent vector storage for docs. Whether you’re working with local files or connecting to a vector database, you can use Koog to build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines.\nThe setup is modular, allowing you to add support for different formats, ranking methods, and backends.\n\nBuilt-In observability and moderation for agents\nWe’ve added native OpenTelemetry support. This means you can now trace, log, and measure your agents using the same tools you’d use elsewhere in your system, enabling you to spot bottlenecks, track behaviour, and keep things running smoothly.\n\nAnd if you’re deploying in regulated environments, there’s also built-in support for moderation. Agents can now check their own outputs to make sure they’re appropriate and safe. This is especially useful when trust and compliance are a priority.\nRunning tasks in parallel\nSometimes your agent graph includes steps that can run independently. Koog now supports parallel execution of those nodes, following a familiar MapReduce-style API.\nYou can launch several branches simultaneously, transform their results asynchronously, and collect everything at the end. This approach is useful when you want to try multiple strategies at once or speed up multi-step workflows.\n\nA better fit for your stack\nKoog now works better with Spring. If you’re using Spring Boot, you’ll get ready-made beans and auto-configured LLM clients out of the box.\nThe release also adds support for ReAct-style agent thinking. Agents can now follow step-by-step reasoning paths, switching between thoughts and actions.\nYou’ll also find updates that help agents handle uncertainty better. The new Retry component makes them more resilient, and multiple-choice reasoning gives them new ways to explore options and respond to user preferences.\nA few more things to get excited about\nThis version brings a handful of other improvements that are worth highlighting:\nAgents can now receive image input when running with Ollama-backed models.\nFull WebAssembly (WASM) support means you can now deploy Koog agents to the browser.\nNative support for Amazon Bedrock has been added.\nFact-retrieval history compression has been improved to help agents focus on the correct data without getting confused by unrelated context.\nAgents can now work with arbitrary input and output types, providing greater flexibility in the execution flow.\nWe’ve also fixed several bugs to make the overall UX smoother.\nKoog 0.3.0 is a step toward making agents more robust, portable, and valuable.\nMany of these updates were implemented on the basis of community feedback, so thanks to everyone who’s tried it out, opened issues, or shared ideas. \nIf you haven’t yet, now’s a good time to try Koog and see what you can build.\nYour contributions make the difference\nWe’d like to take this opportunity to extend a huge thank-you to the entire community for contributing to the development of Koog through your feedback, issue reports, and pull requests!\nHere’s a list of this release’s top contributors:\nNathan Fallet Azure OpenAI and other general improvements\nDidier Villevalois Ollama updates\nJason Pearson AWS Bedrock improvements\nDenys Kurylenko MCP enhancements",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "While building Spring Boot applications, you can leverage Testcontainers to spin up any required services, such as a database or messaging broker, as Docker containers at application startup. This enables a ready-to-code setup, minimizing environment friction so you can focus on delivering high-quality, maintainable code.\nFor database-driven development, IntelliJ IDEA provides enterprise-grade, professional-level tooling out of the box. You can:\nReverse-engineer JPA entities from an existing schema\nGenerate Flyway or Liquibase migrations directly from your JPA models\nAccess a suite of built-in integrations (e.g., SQL consoles, schema diff, and more) that help you maintain a clean, consistent database lifecycle\nIntelliJ IDEA’s ergonomic UI and preconfigured environments allow you to code faster, refactor more smoothly, and catch potential issues before they become bugs. This means that using IntelliJ IDEA combined with Testcontainers is a productivity booster. However, there is just one problem…\nTestcontainers map container ports to random host ports to avoid conflicts. Each time you restart your application, you must fetch the new mapped port and manually update IntelliJ IDEA’s DataSource connection properties.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains addressed this problem with the Spring Debugger plugin. It automatically registers the DataSource connection to any relational databases started by Testcontainers. Additionally, the DataSource connection will be automatically created while running Testcontainers tests. You can use the Spring Debugger plugin with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.1.2 or any later versions.\nNOTE: Spring Debugger automatic DataSource registration works with Testcontainers and Docker Compose too.\nYou can also watch the demonstration of Spring Debugger plugin’s automatic DataSource registration feature in this video.\n\n\nSpring Debugger: Working With Dynamic Database Connections Just Got Simpler\n\n\n\nLet’s explore this feature using a practical example.\nLocal development using Testcontainers\nTo follow along, clone the Spring Boot sample project from here.\nThis repository contains a Spring Boot REST API project using the starters Spring Web, Validation, Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL Driver, Flyway Migration, and Testcontainers.\nOpen the project in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and run TestBookmarksApplication.java in debug mode to start the application.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, when you start the application, Testcontainers start a PostgreSQL database, and a PostgreSQL DataSource is automatically registered in IntelliJ IDEA’s Database tool window.\nNOTE: The DataSource will be automatically registered ONLY when you start the application in debug mode.\nWhen you stop the application, the registered DataSource will be automatically deleted from the Database tool window.\nDebugging Testcontainers based tests\nA DataSource is automatically registered both when running the application and when running tests. You can run your Testcontainers-based tests in debug mode, set a breakpoint, and explore the data in your database.\nHere is an example of running a Spring Boot integration test that interacts with a PostgreSQL database started by Testcontainers.\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, while running the test, we can set a breakpoint and verify the data in the database if needed.\nHere is another example of debugging a Spring Data JPA Repository test using @DataJpaTest.\n\n\n\n\nLocal development and testing with MongoDB\nIn addition to the relational databases, the automatic registration of the DataSource works for MongoDB as well.\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nIntelliJ IDEA’s automatic registration of Testcontainers data sources in the Database tool window eliminates the need for manually registering the DataSources. This makes local development and debugging of the Testcontainers tests using databases much simpler.\nAs of now, this feature works for relational databases and MongoDB only, but support for more databases will be added in upcoming IntelliJ IDEA versions.\nTo learn more about the features of the Spring Debugger plugin, please read the documentation.\nWhat are you waiting for? Download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate and install the Spring Debugger plugin and try the features of its plugin for yourself.",

'믿거나 말거나 폭력은 긴 세월에 걸쳐 감소해왔고 오늘날 우리는 인류가 존재한 이래 가장 평화로운 시대를 살고 있는 것인지도 모른다 ' 이 얼마나 아름답고 낭만적이며 미래지향적인가. 절대적인 숫자만 보면 사실이기도\n\n\n\n핑커는 문명 판단 기준을 (왜곡된) 사망자 수로 단순화했다. 그리고 우리는 판단이 쉬운 해피엔딩 (선악 구분이 뚜렷한 백설공주같은) 스토리를 좋아한다. 핑커의 성공 요인\n\n\n아마 저자들도 이런 분위기를 모르지는 않았을 것이다. 반향 없는 메아리에 그칠 가능성이 높다는 사실을 알면서도 자신들의 전문 분야에 대한 잘못된 시각이 바로 잡히길 바라는 저자들이 애처롭다(..)\n\n스티븐 핑커의 역사서는 성격은 모호함에도 그에 대한 반응에는 역사학자들을 위한 중요한 교훈이 있다. 핑커의 메시지는 대중에게 도달하는 반면 우리의 메시지는 그렇지 못하다는 것이다. 왜 학문적 역사서들은 북아메리카의 대중 역사서들만큼 열렬히 읽히지 않는가? 이 점이야말로 우리가 다음에 톺아봐야 할 문제 (354 페이지)\n\n\n문제를 알고 있었다면 처음부터 접근을 좀 달리했으면 어땠을까? 17:1의 싸움을 걸어 핑커 체급만 키워주지 말고, 자신들의 주장을 대중이 좀 더 좋아할만한 방향으로 적당히 타협해서 책을 쓸 수도 있지 않았을까? \n\n\n900여 페이지에 걸쳐 핑커의 시대별, 문화별, 국가별 오류를 조목조목 지적하면서 세상은 복잡하기 짝이 없고, 절대 진리같은 건 없음을 알려주는 이 책은 일단 너무 논문스럽고, 그래서인지 너무 지루하고, 결정적으로 너무 늦었다(..)\n \n\n\n\n17인의 저자가 하나같이 사실 증거와 주장을 구구절절 서술하는데, 통일된 공통 양식이나 도식화 등을 이용해서 좀 더 체계적으로 정리된 느낌을 전달했으면 더 큰 반향을 얻을 수도 있지 않았을까 싶은, 아쉬움이 남는 책이다.\n\n선동은 문장 한 줄로도 가능하지만 그것을 반박하려면 수십 장의 문서와 증거가 필요하다. 그리고 그것을 반박하려고 할 때쯤 사람들은 이미 선동당해 있다",

        "contentSnippet": "Deep Research, 이제 최신 정보까지!   ChatGPT의 한계를 넘어선 Scholar GPT로 더욱 스마트한 연구를 경험하세요.\n\n\n \n 혹시 ChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구를 써보셨나요? 정말 유용하지만, 가끔 최신 정보를 찾는 데 아쉬움을 느꼈던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아니겠죠? 저는 이 부분이 항상 아쉬웠어요. 특히 정보의 신선함이 중요한 연구나 빠르게 변화하는 분야에서는 더욱 그렇고요. 그런데 말이죠, 이 갈증을 시원하게 해결해 줄 'Scholar GPT'라는 커스텀 GPT를 최근에 발견했지 뭐예요!  \n \n최신 정보, 이젠 문제없어요!  \n제가 처음 ChatGPT의 Deep Research를 사용했을 때, 여러 범주에서 도구를 테스트해봤어요. 다양한 범주에서 Copilot의 동등 기능보다 뛰어났지만, 최신 정보를 찾는 데 있어서는 고전했습니다. 대부분의 경우 2년 이내의 관련 정보를 찾기 어려웠고, 이는 도구를 사용하는 목적을 무의미하게 만들었습니다.\n하지만 Scholar GPT는 훨씬 더 최신 정보를 잘 찾아줍니다. 예를 들어, \"지난 6개월간 발표된 인공지능 기반 질병 진단 최신 연구 논문 5편을 찾아줘. 각 논문의 핵심 요약과 PubMed 또는 arXiv 링크를 함께 제공해 줘.\"라고 요청하면 사실들의 정리된 목록과 함께 원본 링크도 제공합니다. 이를 통해 정보를 정리하기 매우 쉬워집니다. 때로는 원본 자료 링크 없이 글머리표 형식의 목록만 받기도 하지만, 조금 더 아래로 스크롤하면 유용한 온라인 자료에 대한 링크를 찾을 수 있습니다. Scholar GPT의 테이블(표) 보기 방식은 모든 것을 쉽게 소화할 수 있는 형식으로 제시해 줍니다.\n\n\n  알아두세요!\nScholar GPT는 최신 연구 자료를 정리된 목록과 원본 링크와 함께 제공하여 정보 파악을 용이하게 합니다.\n \n복잡한 연구 문서도 한 번에 요약!  \n관련성 높고 시의적절한 정보를 찾는 것 외에도, Scholar GPT는 연구 문서를 읽고 그 결과를 요약할 수 있습니다. 이 기능은 짧은 문서에 특히 유용하며, 핵심 내용을 쉽게 파악할 수 있게 해 줍니다.\n더 좋은 건, 방대한 PDF 문서에도 유용하다는 점이에요. 예를 들어, \"첨부된 '지속 가능한 에너지 시스템 전환에 대한 글로벌 보고서.pdf'를 읽고, 주요 연구 결과와 보고서에서 제시하는 미래 전망에 대해 500자 내외로 요약해 줘.\"와 같이 문서를 업로드하면 간단한 개요를 제공해 줍니다. 핵심 결과 외에도, 이 도구는 균형 잡힌 시각을 제시하려 하며 \"상관관계가 인과관계인지\"에 대해 의문을 제기합니다. 초기 연구를 마친 뒤 Scholar GPT는 더 깊이 탐색할 기회를 제공하는데요. 예를 들어, 커스텀 GPT를 사용하여 마인드맵을 만들거나, 내용을 더 쉽게 설명해달라고 요청하거나, 동일 주제의 다른 연구 결과와 비교할 수 있습니다. 각 문서마다 이를 반복해서 적용할 수 있으며, 이후에 모든 아이디어를 통합하여 더 효과적으로 학습할 수 있습니다.\nScholar GPT 문서 요약 기능 비교\n구분\nDeep Research\nScholar GPT\n특징\n\n\n\n\n최신 정보 탐색\n2년 이내 정보 제한적\n매우 뛰어남 (정리된 목록, 원본 링크 제공)\n정보 신선도와 접근성 우위\n\n\n연구 문서 요약\n간단한 개요 제공\n핵심 결과 요약, 비판적 시각 제공\n심층 분석 및 균형 잡힌 정보 제공\n\n\n학습 전략\n제공 기능 제한적\n마인드맵, 쉬운 설명, 비교 분석 등 다양\n개인화된 학습 경험 지원\n\n\n링크 분석\n실패 사례 빈번\n뛰어난 성능 (개요, 비판적 분석, 대안 제시)\n정확하고 다각적인 관점 제공\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nScholar GPT는 학문적 연구에 매우 강력하지만, 쇼핑 추천이나 일상적인 정보 탐색에는 Deep Research가 더 유용할 수 있습니다. 각 도구의 장점을 이해하고 목적에 맞게 활용하는 것이 중요해요!\n \n링크 분석도 똑똑하게!  \n저는 예전부터 ChatGPT에 링크를 업로드해서 읽게 할 때 실패하는 경우가 많아서, 그냥 파일을 업로드하는 걸 선호했어요. 그런데 Scholar GPT는 이 부분에서 꽤 좋은 성능을 보여줍니다. 링크를 업로드하기 전에 챗에 \"링크를 공유할 예정\"이라고 미리 알릴 수 있습니다.\n\n\n그러면 Scholar GPT는 제가 특정 주제를 탐색하고 싶은지 물어보며, 원한다면 해당 주제를 입력하라고 안내합니다. 예를 들어, \"이 링크에 있는 기사를 읽고, 데이터 프라이버시 침해 사례와 그에 대한 법적 대응 방안을 중심으로 분석해 줘. 또한, 해당 기사에 대한 비판적인 관점이나 추가적으로 고려해야 할 대안적 관점이 있다면 함께 제시해 줘.\"와 같이 구체적으로 요청하여 더 정확한 답변을 얻을 수 있으며, 나중에 수정을 해야 할 필요도 줄어듭니다. 링크를 업로드하면 Scholar GPT는 해당 페이지나 문서를 읽고, 가장 중요한 개념에 대한 개요를 제공합니다. 제시 방식이 훌륭하고, 추가 정보가 필요할 경우 후속 질문도 할 수 있습니다.\n개인적으로 Scholar GPT에게 링크 분석을 요청할 때는 \"비판적 분석\"과 \"대안적 관점 생성\"을 요청하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 더 균형 잡힌 시각을 얻을 수 있고, 논문이 편향되어 보일 경우에도 보다 합리적인 학습이 가능합니다.\n  알아두세요!\n링크 분석 시 비판적 분석과 대안적 관점 생성을 함께 요청하면, 정보의 편향성을 줄이고 균형 잡힌 시각을 얻는 데 도움이 됩니다.\n \n나만의 연구 비서, Scholar GPT!  ‍ ‍ \n연구 논문을 읽고 요약해 주는 것 외에도 Scholar GPT는 전반적인 연구 능력 향상에도 도움을 줍니다. 예를 들어, 학습 능력을 향상시키는 방법에 대해 더 깊이 이해하고자 할 때 사용할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n초기 프롬프트로 다음과 같이 입력할 수 있습니다: \"내가 '비판적 읽기 능력'을 향상시키고 싶어. Scholar GPT에 내장된 비판적 읽기 훈련 기능을 보여줄 수 있을까?\". 그러면 Scholar GPT는 여러 가지 비판적 읽기 방법을 제시하고, 각 방법에 대한 간단한 설명도 제공합니다. 이어서 다음과 같이 후속 질문을 할 수 있습니다: \"제시된 비판적 읽기 방법 중 '스키밍(Skimming)'에 대해 더 자세히 알려줄 수 있니? 구체적인 활용법과 예시를 들어 설명해 줘.\". 그러면 GPT는 더 포괄적인 개요를 제공하며, 연습 과제도 수행할 수 있습니다. 이는 학교에서 ChatGPT를 가장 잘 활용하는 방법 중 하나입니다.\n  알아두세요!\nScholar GPT는 단순 정보 제공을 넘어, 비판적 읽기 능력 향상과 같은 실질적인 연구 스킬 개발에도 도움을 줍니다.\n \n나만의 연구 전략, 함께 세워봐요!  \n일반적인 학습 프레임워크를 따라 할 수는 있지만, 모든 프레임워크가 자신에게 맞는 것은 아니죠. 따라서 보다 전략적으로 접근해 본인에게 맞는 방식을 찾아야 합니다. Scholar GPT는 이 과정을 도와줄 수 있습니다. 다음과 같은 프롬프트를 입력하면 됩니다: \"내 석사 논문 주제인 '도시 열섬 현상이 기후 변화에 미치는 영향'에 대한 연구를 시작하려고 해. 가장 효율적인 연구 전략 3가지를 간단한 설명과 함께 알려줘.\".\n\n\n그러면 Scholar GPT는 목록을 제공합니다. 이후에는 특정 전략을 개발하는 데 도움을 요청할 수 있습니다. 이때 포괄적인 개요를 받아본 후, 필요에 따라 맞춤화하여 활용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, \"제시된 전략 중 '질문 기반 연구(Inquiry-Based Research)'를 제 석사 논문 주제인 '기후 변화가 도시 생태계에 미치는 영향'에 적용하여 구체적인 연구 계획을 세우는 데 도움을 줄 수 있을까?\"와 같이 구체적으로 요청하여 정말 저만의 연구 코치를 둔 것 같은 기분이었어요!\n사례: A 학생의 연구 전략 수립 과정\n초기 고민: 연구 자료가 너무 많아 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 막막함.\nScholar GPT 활용 프롬프트: \"일반적인 연구 전략 3가지 알려줘\"\n개선 과정: 전략 맞춤화\n1) Scholar GPT가 제시한 전략 중 '핵심 개념 지도화' 선택.\n2) 후속 프롬프트: \"핵심 개념 지도화 전략을 내 논문 주제인 'AI 윤리'에 맞게 구체화해줘.\"\n최종 결과: 맞춤형 연구 전략\n- 개념 매핑: AI 윤리 관련 핵심 용어(편향, 투명성, 책임) 정의 및 관계 시각화.\n- 자료 분류: 각 용어별 최신 연구 논문, 법규, 실제 사례 분류 및 연결.\n이처럼 Scholar GPT를 활용하면 막연했던 연구 과정을 나에게 최적화된 전략으로 구체화하고 효율적으로 진행할 수 있어요. 정말 똑똑한 연구 파트너죠!\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약  \n지금까지 Scholar GPT가 ChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구를 어떻게 보완하고 능가하는지 자세히 알아봤는데요. 제가 직접 사용해보니 Scholar GPT는 정말 유용한 기능이 많고, 특히 최신 연구 자료를 찾거나 심도 있는 학습 전략을 개발하는 데 탁월한 성능을 보여줬어요. 학문적 연구를 하는 입장에서는 Scholar GPT가 Deep Research보다 훨씬 뛰어나다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있습니다. 더 정확하고 빠른 정보 탐색이 가능하니까요!\n물론, 쇼핑 추천이나 일상적인 정보 탐색 같은 목적이라면 여전히 ChatGPT의 Deep Research도 충분히 매력적인 도구예요. Scholar GPT가 연구 논문을 읽는 데 더 특화되어 있다면, Deep Research는 좀 더 일반적인 정보 탐색에 강점을 보인다고 할 수 있습니다. 그러니까, 여러분의 목적에 맞게 두 가지 도구를 적절히 활용한다면 정말 스마트하고 효율적인 정보 탐색을 할 수 있을 거예요! 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요~  \n \n \nScholar GPT, 핵심 요약!\n✨ 최신 정보 탐색: Deep Research보다 훨씬 뛰어남! 정리된 목록과 원본 링크까지 제공해요.\n  연구 문서 요약: 방대한 PDF도 OK! 핵심 결과뿐만 아니라 비판적 시각까지 제시해 줍니다.\n  링크 분석 성능:\n성공률 ⬆️ (이젠 링크도 자신있게!) ➡️ 비판적/대안적 관점 분석 요청으로 더 풍부한 인사이트 확보 가능!\n ‍  연구 능력 향상: 맞춤형 학습 전략과 비판적 읽기 스킬까지 도와주는 스마트한 연구 비서!\n학문적 연구에는 Scholar GPT, 일상 정보 탐색에는 Deep Research! 목적에 맞게 활용하는 것이 중요합니다.\n \n ✨ Scholar GPT 바로가기 ✨ \n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Scholar GPT는 Deep Research의 완전한 대체재인가요?\nA: 아니요!

        "contentSnippet": "ChatGPT, 당신의 똑똑한 비서일까, 아니면 착각의 시작일까? 일상에서 ChatGPT를 현명하게 사용하는 비법과 주의할 점을 현직 전문가가 솔직하게 파헤쳐 봅니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 인터넷을 보면 온통 ChatGPT 이야기뿐이에요. “ChatGPT가 몇 년간 해결 못한 문제를 단번에 풀어줬다”는 둥, “누가 질문했는데, 진짜 기가 막힌 해답을 줬다”는 둥, 심지어 “공부, 글쓰기, 상담, 여행 계획까지 다 되더라!”는 과장된(?) 이야기까지 심심치 않게 들려오죠. 솔직히 이런 얘기들, 과장된 부분도 있지만 사실이기도 해요. 저도 의료 현장에서 일하는 전문가로서, 의학 분야는 물론이고 일상생활의 다양한 문제 해결에 ChatGPT를 직접 활용해보면서 그 잠재력을 충분히 느꼈거든요. \n그런데 문제는… 너무 많은 사람들이 이 도구의 한계 없이 맹신하고 있다는 겁니다. 제가 이 글을 쓰는 이유도 여기에 있어요. 일반인들이 ChatGPT를 잘 활용하기 위한 현실적인 기준선을 공유하고, 진짜 스마트한 사용자가 될 수 있도록 돕고 싶었거든요.\n \n✅ ChatGPT가 빛을 발하는 상황들\n제 경험상, ChatGPT가 진짜 유용하게 느껴지는 순간들이 있습니다. 특히 아래와 같은 상황에서는 ‘이거 진짜 물건이다!’ 싶을 때가 많아요.\n1. 이미 아는 내용을 정리하거나 확장하고 싶을 때 \n“내가 아는 이 개념, 혹시 내가 놓친 부분은 없을까?”, “이 아이디어, 다른 분야에선 어떻게 접근할까?”, “기존 정보를 쉽게 요약해줄 수 있을까?” 이런 식으로 내가 어느 정도 지식을 가지고 있는 상태에서 ChatGPT를 활용하면 정말 강력한 보조 도구가 됩니다.\n예를 들어, 요리 재료의 대체재를 찾거나, 영어 문장을 더 자연스럽게 고치거나, 내가 쓴 자기소개서를 더 깔끔하게 다듬을 때 말이죠. 이미 알고 있는 내용을 검토하거나 보완할 땐 ChatGPT가 최고 수준의 조력자라고 생각합니다.\n2. 정보량이 많고 정형화된 분야에선 더 유용해요 \nChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습되었기 때문에, 문헌이 잘 정리된 분야에서는 특히 정확도가 매우 높습니다. 제가 직접 써보니 진짜 편하더라고요.\n“파리에서 3일간 여행 일정 어떻게 짜야 할까?”\n“엑셀에서 특정 셀에 따라 색깔 바꾸는 조건부 서식은 어떻게 해?”\n“내가 만든 비즈니스 아이디어, 간단한 SWOT 분석 해줘.”\n이처럼 여행 계획, IT 툴 사용법, 기본적인 경영 지식, 글쓰기, 언어 학습 등 객관적이고 이미 체계화된 정보에 대해서는 정말 유용하게 작동합니다. 이건 진짜 인정입니다!\n3. ‘준비용 도구’로 활용할 때 정말 유용해요 \nChatGPT는 “정답”을 주는 도구라기보다는, “정리”와 “준비”에 강한 도구입니다. 이 점을 잘 활용하면 정말 좋아요.\n인터뷰 보기 전에 연습 질문 만들기\n발표 전에 흐름 잡기\n자기소개서 초안 잡기\n상담 받기 전에 나의 고민 정리하기\n즉, 생각을 말로 풀기 어렵거나, 복잡한 내용을 정리할 때 활용하면 빛을 발하죠. 저도 덕분에 여러 번 도움을 받았습니다.\n \n⚠️ ChatGPT를 쓸 때 조심해야 할 상황들\n아무리 똑똑한 ChatGPT라도 만능은 아닙니다. 오히려 잘못 사용하면 독이 될 수 있는 상황들도 분명히 존재해요. 제가 경험하며 느낀 점들을 솔직히 말씀드릴게요.\n1. 중요한 정보를 빼놓고 질문했을 때 \nChatGPT는 기본적으로 제가 입력한 정보만 가지고 답을 합니다. 그니까요, 내가 중요한 사실을 빼먹으면, 엉뚱하거나 틀린 답을 줄 수도 있다는 거죠. 너무 당연한 얘기 같지만, 의외로 많은 분들이 이걸 간과해요.\n예를 들어, “퇴사하고 싶은데 어떻게 해야 하나요?”라고 물었는데, ‘이미 다른 일자리 제안도 있고, 상사와의 갈등도 심하다’는 중요한 정보를 빼먹었다고 해봅시다. 그럼 GPT는 아주 일반적인 퇴사 절차나 장단점만 말할 거예요. 실제 나에게는 전혀 도움이 안 되는 정보가 될 수 있다는 거죠. 정확한 답을 원한다면, 질문도 그만큼 정확하고 구체적이어야 합니다. 정보가 부족하면, 그냥 엉뚱한 답을 받게 되는 거예요.\n2. 내가 원하는 방향으로 ‘유도 질문’할 때 \n사람은 누구나 듣고 싶은 말을 듣고 싶어 하는 본능이 있잖아요? 그래서 ChatGPT에게도 자기도 모르게 “유도 질문”을 하게 되는 경우가 정말 많아요.\n❌ “이런 상황이면 그 사람이 나쁜 거 맞죠?”\n❌ “제가 그만두는 게 정답이겠죠?”\n이렇게 묻는 순간, ChatGPT는 여러분의 생각을 그럴듯하게 합리화해 줄 가능성이 높아요. 제 경험상 진짜 그랬어요. 하지만 그게 과연 진짜 진실일까요? 아닐 수도 있습니다. 답을 강요하지 말고, 항상 열린 질문을 던지세요. “이런 상황에서는 어떤 선택지가 있을까요?”, “장단점을 비교해줄 수 있나요?” 이렇게요!\n3. 전문적인 판단이 필요한 영역에서는 무조건 조심!  \nChatGPT는 분명 똑똑하지만, ‘판단’은 못 합니다. 그냥 학습된 데이터를 기반으로 확률적으로 가장 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 뿐이죠. 특히 아래와 같은 분야에서는 무조건 사람 전문가와 상의해야 해요.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n법률 상담: 상황 설명이 주관적이면, 편향되거나 잘못된 조언이 나올 수 있습니다.\n의료 정보: ChatGPT는 진단 도구가 아닙니다. 단지 “가능성”을 말할 뿐이니, 건강 문제는 무조건 전문가와 상담하세요.\n재무·투자: 시장의 실시간 변화나 개인의 복잡한 재무 상황을 정확히 반영하지 못할 수 있습니다.\n정말 중요한 결정이 필요한 순간이라면 반드시 사람 전문가와 상의하세요. ChatGPT는 보조 도구일 뿐이지, 절대 책임지는 도구가 아닙니다.\n \n  현명하게 활용하는 방법 요약 \n자, 그럼 이쯤에서 ChatGPT를 어떻게 하면 더 현명하고 똑똑하게 활용할 수 있을지 핵심만 쏙쏙 뽑아 다시 한번 정리해 드릴게요.\n상황\nChatGPT 활용 팁\n\n\n\n\n정보 정리 및 확장\n내가 아는 내용을 요약하거나, 복잡한 개념을 쉽게 풀어서 정리할 때 사용해요. 이미 기반 지식이 있을 때 활용하면 좋아요.\n\n\n준비 활동\n면접, 상담, 발표, 병원 방문 전 내 생각을 정리하거나 연습 질문을 만들 때 정말 유용해요. 초안 잡기 최고!\n\n\n학습 보조\n모르는 개념을 쉽게 풀어서 설명해달라고 요청할 수 있어요. 단, 얻은 정보는 반드시 다른 신뢰할 수 있는 출처로 검증해야 합니다.\n\n\n아이디어 발전\n글쓰기 초안, 기획서의 큰 그림 잡기, 마케팅 문구의 여러 가지 버전을 만들 때 아이디어 생성 도구로 활용하면 좋아요.\n\n\n주관적 문제\n감정이 섞인 판단이나 개인적인 결정을 내릴 때는 GPT의 ‘말’을 맹신하지 말고, 항상 ‘객관식’처럼 여러 선택지를 물어보고 스스로 판단하세요.\n\n\n\n \n마무리: ChatGPT를 똑똑하게 쓰는 사람 \n결론적으로, ChatGPT는 여러분을 도와줄 수 있는 뛰어난 비서이자 보조 도구입니다. 하지만 절대 멘토, 의사, 변호사, 심리 상담사 그 자체는 아니라는 점을 꼭 기억해야 해요.\n정보를 찾을 땐 가능한 한 객관적이고 구체적으로 질문하는 연습을 하고, 무엇보다도 자신의 생각을 검토하고 정리하는 도구로써 활용하면 이보다 더 좋은 AI 파트너는 없을 겁니다. ChatGPT를 똑똑하게 쓰는 사람, 그게 결국 스마트한 시대의 진짜 고수가 아닐까요? 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든 댓글로 물어봐주세요~ \n \n \nChatGPT 현명하게 활용하기 핵심 요약\n✨ 활용의 시작: 기존 지식 정리 및 확장에 최적화된 도구입니다.\n  강점 분야: 정보량이 많고 정형화된 분야에서 특히 강력한 성능을 발휘합니다.\n  핵심 역할:\nAI는 '정답' 아닌 '준비 & 정리' 도구!\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 정보 부족/유도 질문/전문적 판단 요구 시 오작동 가능성이 높습니다.\nChatGPT는 훌륭한 비서지만, 최종 판단은 언제나 여러분의 몫입니다!\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: ChatGPT가 제 직업을 대체할 수도 있을까요?\nA:   ChatGPT는 특정 업무의 효율성을 높이는 데 도움을 줄 수 있지만, 인간의 창의적 사고, 공감 능력, 윤리적 판단 등을 대체하기는 어렵습니다. 오히려 AI를 활용해 업무 역량을 강화하는 방향으로 나아가는 것이 중요합니다.\nQ: ChatGPT가 알려준 정보가 정확한지 어떻게 알 수 있나요?\nA:   ChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습하지만, 최신 정보나 특정 분야의 심층적인 내용은 오류가 있을 수 있습니다. 반드시 교차 검증을 통해 신뢰할 수 있는 다른 출처(전문 서적, 공신력 있는 웹사이트 등)와 비교하여 확인하는 것이 중요해요.\nQ: ChatGPT에게 개인 정보를 입력해도 괜찮을까요?\nA:   어떤 AI 서비스든 민감한 개인 정보(주민등록번호, 계좌 정보, 건강 정보 등)는 입력하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 입력된 정보가 어떻게 활용되고 저장될지 명확하지 않을 수 있으니 항상 주의해야 해요.\nQ: ChatGPT를 활용하면 글쓰기 능력이 떨어지지 않을까요?\nA:   오히려 글쓰기 능력을 향상시킬 수 있는 좋은 도구가 될 수 있습니다. 초안 작성, 문맥 교정, 다양한 표현 학습 등에 활용하여 글쓰기 보조 도구로 사용하면 좋습니다. 다만, 맹목적으로 의존하기보다는 스스로 생각하고 다듬는 과정을 거쳐야 합니다.\nQ: ChatGPT를 어떤 질문에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\nA:   ‘정답’이 정해져 있는 사실 기반의 질문, 아이디어 발상, 정보 요약, 글 초안 작성 등 비교적 객관적이고 광범위한 질문에 효과적입니다. 개인의 주관적인 판단이나 감정적인 조언이 필요한 질문보다는 정보 검색 및 정리에 집중하는 것이 좋습니다.\n\n\n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT가 제 직업을 대체할 수도 있을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ChatGPT는 특정 업무의 효율성을 높이는 데 도움을 줄 수 있지만, 인간의 창의적 사고, 공감 능력, 윤리적 판단 등을 대체하기는 어렵습니다. 오히려 AI를 활용해 업무 역량을 강화하는 방향으로 나아가는 것이 중요합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT가 알려준 정보가 정확한지 어떻게 알 수 있나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ChatGPT는 방대한 데이터를 기반으로 학습하지만, 최신 정보나 특정 분야의 심층적인 내용은 오류가 있을 수 있습니다. 반드시 교차 검증을 통해 신뢰할 수 있는 다른 출처(전문 서적, 공신력 있는 웹사이트 등)와 비교하여 확인하는 것이 중요해요.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT에게 개인 정보를 입력해도 괜찮을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  어떤 AI 서비스든 민감한 개인 정보(주민등록번호, 계좌 정보, 건강 정보 등)는 입력하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 입력된 정보가 어떻게 활용되고 저장될지 명확하지 않을 수 있으니 항상 주의해야 해요.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT를 활용하면 글쓰기 능력이 떨어지지 않을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  오히려 글쓰기 능력을 향상시킬 수 있는 좋은 도구가 될 수 있습니다. 초안 작성, 문맥 교정, 다양한 표현 학습 등에 활용하여 글쓰기 보조 도구로 사용하면 좋습니다. 다만, 맹목적으로 의존하기보다는 스스로 생각하고 다듬는 과정을 거쳐야 합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"ChatGPT를 어떤 질문에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  ‘정답’이 정해져 있는 사실 기반의 질문, 아이디어 발상, 정보 요약, 글 초안 작성 등 비교적 객관적이고 광범위한 질문에 효과적입니다. 개인의 주관적인 판단이나 감정적인 조언이 필요한 질문보다는 정보 검색 및 정리에 집중하는 것이 좋습니다.\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }",

Poe는 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해줍니다. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 같은 쟁쟁한 AI 모델들을 하나의 인터페이스에서 자유롭게 이용할 수 있거든요. 코딩이 필요할 때는 GPT-4를, 창의적인 글쓰기를 할 때는 Claude를 선택하는 식으로, 작업의 성격에 맞춰 최적의 모델을 고를 수 있다는 게 정말 큰 장점이에요. 단일 모델만 제공하는 ChatGPT와는 확실히 다른 부분이죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 Poe에는 Poe 자체 모델은 물론, 우리 같은 사용자들이 직접 만든 특화된 봇들도 많아서 활용도가 무궁무진해요. 마치 나만의 AI 비서들을 여럿 데리고 다니는 느낌이랄까? 단순한 대화형 AI를 넘어, 목적에 딱 맞는 도구로 진화한 거죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  알아두세요!</b><br />Poe는 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에 모아두어, 필요에 따라 모델을 바꾸거나 비교하면서 사용할 수 있는 환경을 제공해요. 최신 모델들을 바로바로 경험해 볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 매력이죠!</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>텍스트를 넘어, 멀티모달 AI의 자유로움  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Poe의 진짜 강점은 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">&lsquo;통합성&rsquo;</span>이에요. 웹사이트나 앱을 여러 개 켜놓고 이리저리 왔다 갔다 할 필요 없이, 모든 AI 모델을 한곳에서 쓸 수 있다는 게 너무 편하죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT와 Claude에 같은 질문을 던지고 어떤 답변이 더 좋은지 바로 비교해볼 수 있어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 Poe는 텍스트만 다루는 게 아니더라고요. Eleven Labs의 기술을 사용해서 AI의 답변을 자연스러운 음성으로 변환해 주거나, 심지어 다운로드도 할 수 있어요. 영상 생성까지 지원한다는 점은 정말 놀라웠죠. Sora, Kling, Runway 같은 최신 이미지&middot;비디오 생성 모델들을 활용해서 머릿속 아이디어를 눈 깜짝할 사이에 시각화할 수 있어요. 이 모든 기능이 하나의 구독으로 제공되니, 여러 유료 서비스에 따로 돈 낼 필요도 없고요!</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"poe.png\" data-origin-width=\"1486\" data-origin-height=\"900\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bGCcze/btsPluQFTmy/t73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbGCcze%2FbtsPluQFTmy%2Ft73NlUmpxVzDepidFS1OEK%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"poe 화면\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1486\" height=\"900\" data-filename=\"poe.png\" data-origin-width=\"1486\" data-origin-height=\"900\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #dc3545; margin: 20px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>ChatGPT와 Poe, 무엇이 다를까?&nbsp;</b></h3>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 20px 0;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">구분</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">ChatGPT Plus</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">Poe 프리미엄</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd; background-color: #f5f5f5; font-weight: bold;\">특징</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용 모델</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">주로 OpenAI 모델 (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 등)</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama 등 다양</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">단일 모델 vs. 멀티 모델 지원</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">개인화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용자 정보 기반 지속적 개인화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">매 대화 초기화 (봇 제작 시 개인화 가능)</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">장기 기억 학습 여부</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">멀티모달 기능</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">일부 이미지 생성, 웹 브라우징 등</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">음성, 이미지, 비디오 생성 통합</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">지원하는 미디어 종류 및 통합성</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f9f9f9;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">사용량 제한</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">정액제 기반, 일정량 이상 사용 가능</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">포인트 소모, 과도한 사용 시 일시 제한</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #ddd;\">합리적 사용량 관리의 중요성</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>⚠️ 주의하세요!</b><br />Poe는 강력하지만, 프리미엄 모델 사용 시 포인트를 소모하는 방식이에요. 무제한 사용이 아닌 만큼, 계획적으로 사용하는 것이 중요하겠죠?</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>나만의 AI 봇 만들기: 상상력을 현실로&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Poe는 그냥 여러 AI를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">'나만의 AI 봇'을 직접 만들고 공유</span>할 수 있는 기능을 제공해요. 처음엔 '내가 뭘 만든다고?' 싶었는데, 막상 해보니 정말 재밌더라고요. 글쓰기 도우미, 언어 튜터, 심지어 특정 롤플레잉 파트너까지, 나만의 목적에 딱 맞는 맞춤형 봇을 만들어서 활용할 수 있어요.

        "contentSnippet": "ChatGPT에서 Poe로 전환을 검토해도 좋은 이유 ✨ 끊임없이 발전하는 AI 세상에서, 단 하나의 도구만 고집할 필요는 없죠. 이 글에서 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에서 만날 수 있는 Poe로 전환을 고민해봐도 좋을 이유를 알려드릴게요!\n\n\n \n 혹시 여러분도 ChatGPT만 사용하고 계신가요?  처음 Poe를 접했을 때, 저도 '또 다른 AI 서비스겠지 뭐' 하는 가벼운 마음이었어요. 그런데 막상 사용해보니, 텍스트부터 이미지, 오디오 작업까지 한 플랫폼에서 다 해결할 수 있다는 사실에 깜짝 놀랐지 뭐예요! 여러 AI 툴을 왔다 갔다 하던 번거로움을 확 줄여주는 느낌이랄까요? 그래서 오늘은 제가 왜 ChatGPT 외에 Poe도 함께 고려해볼 만한지, 그 이유들을 솔직하게 풀어볼까 합니다.\n \n하나의 플랫폼에서 다양한 AI 모델을 경험하다 \nChatGPT만 사용하다 보면, '다른 모델은 어떨까?' 하는 궁금증이 생길 때가 많잖아요. Poe는 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해줍니다. GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 같은 쟁쟁한 AI 모델들을 하나의 인터페이스에서 자유롭게 이용할 수 있거든요. 코딩이 필요할 때는 GPT-4를, 창의적인 글쓰기를 할 때는 Claude를 선택하는 식으로, 작업의 성격에 맞춰 최적의 모델을 고를 수 있다는 게 정말 큰 장점이에요. 단일 모델만 제공하는 ChatGPT와는 확실히 다른 부분이죠.\n게다가 Poe에는 Poe 자체 모델은 물론, 우리 같은 사용자들이 직접 만든 특화된 봇들도 많아서 활용도가 무궁무진해요. 마치 나만의 AI 비서들을 여럿 데리고 다니는 느낌이랄까? 단순한 대화형 AI를 넘어, 목적에 딱 맞는 도구로 진화한 거죠.\n  알아두세요!\nPoe는 다양한 AI 모델을 한곳에 모아두어, 필요에 따라 모델을 바꾸거나 비교하면서 사용할 수 있는 환경을 제공해요. 최신 모델들을 바로바로 경험해 볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 매력이죠!\n \n텍스트를 넘어, 멀티모달 AI의 자유로움  \nPoe의 진짜 강점은 ‘통합성’이에요. 웹사이트나 앱을 여러 개 켜놓고 이리저리 왔다 갔다 할 필요 없이, 모든 AI 모델을 한곳에서 쓸 수 있다는 게 너무 편하죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT와 Claude에 같은 질문을 던지고 어떤 답변이 더 좋은지 바로 비교해볼 수 있어요.\n게다가 Poe는 텍스트만 다루는 게 아니더라고요. Eleven Labs의 기술을 사용해서 AI의 답변을 자연스러운 음성으로 변환해 주거나, 심지어 다운로드도 할 수 있어요. 영상 생성까지 지원한다는 점은 정말 놀라웠죠. Sora, Kling, Runway 같은 최신 이미지·비디오 생성 모델들을 활용해서 머릿속 아이디어를 눈 깜짝할 사이에 시각화할 수 있어요. 이 모든 기능이 하나의 구독으로 제공되니, 여러 유료 서비스에 따로 돈 낼 필요도 없고요!\n\n\nChatGPT와 Poe, 무엇이 다를까? \n구분\nChatGPT Plus\nPoe 프리미엄\n특징\n\n\n\n\n사용 모델\n주로 OpenAI 모델 (GPT-3.5, GPT-4 등)\nGPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Llama 등 다양\n단일 모델 vs. 멀티 모델 지원\n\n\n개인화\n사용자 정보 기반 지속적 개인화\n매 대화 초기화 (봇 제작 시 개인화 가능)\n장기 기억 학습 여부\n\n\n멀티모달 기능\n일부 이미지 생성, 웹 브라우징 등\n음성, 이미지, 비디오 생성 통합\n지원하는 미디어 종류 및 통합성\n\n\n사용량 제한\n정액제 기반, 일정량 이상 사용 가능\n포인트 소모, 과도한 사용 시 일시 제한\n합리적 사용량 관리의 중요성\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nPoe는 강력하지만, 프리미엄 모델 사용 시 포인트를 소모하는 방식이에요. 무제한 사용이 아닌 만큼, 계획적으로 사용하는 것이 중요하겠죠?\n \n나만의 AI 봇 만들기: 상상력을 현실로 \nPoe는 그냥 여러 AI를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, '나만의 AI 봇'을 직접 만들고 공유할 수 있는 기능을 제공해요. 처음엔 '내가 뭘 만든다고?' 싶었는데, 막상 해보니 정말 재밌더라고요. 글쓰기 도우미, 언어 튜터, 심지어 특정 롤플레잉 파트너까지, 나만의 목적에 딱 맞는 맞춤형 봇을 만들어서 활용할 수 있어요. ChatGPT도 비슷한 기능을 시도하고 있지만, Poe는 접근성과 개방성 면에서 훨씬 더 자유로운 느낌이었어요.\n  알아두세요!\nPoe에서 자신만의 커스텀 봇을 만들면, 특정 작업에 최적화된 개인화된 AI 경험을 누릴 수 있어요. 심지어 만든 봇을 다른 사람들과 공유할 수도 있답니다!\n \n실전 예시: 시나리오 작가 J의 Poe 활용기 \n제가 시나리오 작가 친구 J에게 Poe를 추천해줬는데, 그 친구가 정말 유용하게 쓰고 있다고 해요. J의 이야기를 한번 들어볼까요?\n사례 주인공의 상황\nJ는 새로운 SF 시나리오를 구상 중인데, 복잡한 과학 기술 설정과 독특한 캐릭터 설정에 대한 아이디어가 필요했어요.\n기존에는 ChatGPT로 기본적인 아이디어를 얻고, 다른 이미지 생성 AI로 캐릭터와 배경 스케치를 해본 후, 또 다른 툴로 음성 대사를 더빙하는 등 여러 플랫폼을 오가며 작업해야 해서 시간 소모가 컸다고 해요.\nPoe 활용 과정\n1) 아이디어 브레인스토밍: Poe에서 GPT-4와 Claude를 동시에 사용해 시나리오 플롯, 기술 설정, 캐릭터 성격 등 다양한 아이디어를 비교하며 얻었어요.\n2) 시각화 및 음성화: 아이디어가 구체화되면, 바로 Poe 내에서 이미지 생성 모델(Sora 등)을 이용해 장면과 캐릭터의 시안을 만들고, Eleven Labs 음성 생성 기능을 활용해 주요 대사를 미리 들어보며 감정선을 조절했어요.\n최종 결과\n- 작업 효율 증대: 여러 툴을 전환하는 시간과 노력을 크게 줄여, 작업 속도가 2배 이상 빨라졌다고 해요.\n- 창의성 증폭: 다양한 AI 모델의 관점을 즉시 비교하고, 텍스트-이미지-음성으로 이어지는 통합 워크플로우 덕분에 아이디어를 더 풍부하게 발전시킬 수 있었다고 합니다.\nJ의 사례처럼, Poe는 여러 AI 모델과 멀티모달 기능을 통합하여 작업의 효율성과 창의성을 동시에 높여줄 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있어요. 특히 다양한 AI 기능을 유기적으로 연결하고 싶은 분들에게 정말 좋은 선택지가 될 것 같아요.\n \n마무리: Poe, 당신의 AI 활용을 한 단계 업그레이드할 기회 \n저는 처음엔 그저 여러 AI 모델을 비교해보고 싶다는 가벼운 마음으로 Poe를 시작했지만, 써보니 AI를 활용하는 방식 자체를 바꿔주는 경험이었어요. 필요한 기능을 마치 블록처럼 자유롭게 불러 쓸 수 있다는 점이 정말 효율적이었고요.\n특히 텍스트를 바로 이미지나 영상으로 변환하고, 다양한 모델의 해석을 비교하며 아이디어를 빠르게 구체화할 수 있다는 점에서 만족도가 높았습니다. 물론 ChatGPT는 여전히 강력한 도구이지만, 더 폭넓고 자유로운 AI 활용을 원한다면 Poe를 한번쯤 진지하게 고민해볼 가치가 충분하다고 생각해요. 여러분도 Poe와 함께 더 스마트하고 효율적인 AI 라이프를 경험해보시는 건 어떨까요? 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요~ \n \n \nPoe 전환, 왜 고민해야 할까?\n✨ 다양한 AI 모델 통합: GPT-4, Claude, Gemini 등 여러 AI를 한곳에서! 목적에 맞는 최적의 모델을 선택할 수 있어요.\n  멀티모달 기능: 텍스트, 음성, 이미지, 영상 생성까지! 아이디어를 다양한 형태로 빠르게 구현해 보세요.\n  효율적인 워크플로우:\n여러 툴 전환 ✖️ → 하나의 플랫폼 ⭕️ = 작업 시간 단축 & 창의성 증대\n ‍  나만의 AI 봇 제작: 커스텀 봇으로 개인화된 AI 경험을 만들고 공유할 수 있어요.\n단일 AI 툴의 한계를 넘어, AI 활용의 폭을 넓히고 싶다면 Poe를 고려해보세요!\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Poe를 사용하면 ChatGPT는 더 이상 필요 없나요?\nA: 아니요!

(예: 블로그 수익화 컨설턴트 젬)\n다음으로 '요청사항' 칸에 다운로드받은 파일 중 '블로그 수익화 컨설턴트 지침 파일'의 내용을 복사해서 붙여 넣습니다.\n마지막으로 나머지 2개의 텍스트 파일은 '지식' 칸에 파일로 추가한 후 '저장' 버튼을 누르면 끝! 이제 여러분만의 블로그 수익화 컨설턴트 젬이 완성되었습니다.\n \n젬 실행 및 캔버스 기능 활용법  \n젬 등록을 마쳤으니 이제 실제로 젬을 실행하고 강력한 '캔버스' 기능을 활용하는 방법을 알아볼까요? 정말 편리해서 깜짝 놀라실 거예요!\n등록한 젬을 실행하려면 대화창에 \"시작\"이라고 입력하시면 됩니다. 그러면 젬이 여러분에게 50가지 수익화 전략 목록을 모두 보여주면서 \"가장 관심 있는 전략의 번호를 입력해주세요\"라고 친절하게 안내해줄 거예요.\n관심 있는 전략의 번호를 입력하시면, 해당 전략에 최적화된 2개의 추가 질문이 나옵니다. 이 질문들에 가능한 한 구체적이고 솔직하게 답변해주시면 됩니다. 두 질문 모두 답변하셔도 좋고, 추가 정보를 더 제공해주셔도 좋아요.\n여기서 정말 중요한 팁! 답변을 입력하기 전에 대화창 아래에 있는 'CANVAS' 기능을 꼭 활성화해주세요.\n예전에는 HTML 코드로 생성된 출력물을 보려면 코드펜 같은 외부 사이트에 복사해서 붙여 넣어야 하는 번거로움이 있었죠? 하지만 이제는 제미나이에서 캔버스 기능을 통해 바로 실시간으로 결과물을 확인할 수 있게 되었어요! 인터랙티브 대시보드나 인포그래픽이 생성되면 바로 젬 화면에서 클릭하고 조작해볼 수 있답니다. 정말 편리해졌죠?\n \n효과적인 활용법과 실전 팁  \n'블로그 수익화 컨설턴트 젬' 지침을 200% 활용하기 위한 몇 가지 실전 팁을 알려드릴게요. 이 팁들을 잘 기억하시면 여러분의 블로그 수익화 여정이 훨씬 더 순조로울 거예요!\n  핵심 활용 팁!\n하나의 전략에 집중: 한 번에 여러 전략을 시도하기보다는, 특정 번호의 전략 하나에 집중해서 그 효과를 충분히 경험해보세요. 너무 많은 것을 동시에 하면 오히려 혼란스러울 수 있답니다.\n구체적인 답변: 젬의 질문에 답변할 때는 최대한 구체적으로 설명해주세요. 예를 들어 \"재테크 분야요\"보다는 \"30대 직장인을 위한 주식 투자, 특히 미국 ETF 정보\"라고 말씀해주시면 훨씬 더 정확하고 실용적인 조언을 받을 수 있습니다.\n즉시 실행, 결과 확인: 젬이 제시하는 블로그 제목이나 키워드, 글의 구성 등을 바탕으로 바로 실제로 글을 써보고 발행해보세요. 그리고 그 결과를 직접 확인하면서 부족한 점을 개선해나가는 게 중요해요.\n다양한 형태 활용: 단순히 텍스트 리포트만 보지 마시고, 캔버스 기능으로 생성되는 대시보드, 인포그래픽, 프롬프트 등 다양한 형태의 결과물을 적극적으로 활용해보세요. 시각화된 자료는 이해도를 높이고 실행력을 강화하는 데 큰 도움이 된답니다.\n \n실전 사용 예시: 에버그린 주제 발굴 및 정부 정책 활용  \n자, 이제 이 젬 지침이 얼마나 강력한지 실제 사용 예시를 통해 보여드릴게요! 블로그 주제 선정부터 최신 정보 업데이트, 심지어 애드센스 승인 전략까지, 젬이 어떻게 여러분을 도와주는지 확인해보세요.\n첫 번째 예시: 고수익 에버그린 주제 발굴 ✨\n수익형 블로그에서 가장 중요한 건 꾸준히 사랑받는 '에버그린 주제'를 찾는 거예요. 시간이 지나도 가치가 변치 않아 지속적인 트래픽을 유도할 수 있는 주제를 말하죠.\n젬 요청: 50가지 전략 목록에서 '1번 고수익 에버그린 주제'를 선택합니다.\n젬 질문: \"가장 자신 있거나 관심 있는 콘텐츠 분야\"와 \"현재 블로그의 주제\"를 묻습니다.\n저의 답변: \"재테크, 주식\"을 입력하고 캔버스 기능을 활성화합니다.\n젬의 답변: 재테크, 주식 투자와 관련된 에버그린 주제를 각 3개씩 제안하고, 유용한 팁까지 함께 제공합니다. 여기서 놀라운 건 단순 텍스트 리포트가 아니라, 인터랙티브 웹페이지와 시각화된 인포그래픽까지 함께 만들어준다는 거예요. 차트와 그래프로 분석된 자료를 바로 확인해볼 수 있습니다.\n  예시 주제:\n- 장기 투자자를 위한 배당주 포트폴리오 구축 가이드\n- 초보자를 위한 ETF 투자 핵심 전략\n- 복리의 마법! 은퇴 자금 마련을 위한 연금저축 활용법\n두 번째 예시: 정부 정책 활용 정보 제안  \n사람들이 놓치기 쉬운 정부 정책이나 지원금 정보는 블로그 트래픽에 아주 효과적인 주제입니다. 젬이 최신 정보를 어떻게 활용하는지 살펴볼게요.\n젬 요청: '12번 정부 정책/지원금 활용, 사람들이 놓치기 쉬운 꿀팁 정보 제안'을 선택합니다.\n젬 질문: \"어떤 분야의 지원금 정보를 알고 싶은지\", \"타겟층은 누구인지\"를 묻습니다.\n저의 답변: \"민생, 모두\"를 입력합니다.\n젬의 답변: 웹 검색을 기반으로 최신 정보를 요약하여 보여줍니다.\n  웹 검색 기반 최신 정보 요약:\n- 2025년 현재 '민생회복 소비쿠폰'이 전 국민을 대상으로 1인당 최소 15만원에서 최대 55만원까지 지급되고 있으며, 7월 21일부터 1차 신청이 시작되었습니다. \n  적합한 블로그 주제 제안:\n- \"2025 민생회복 소비쿠폰, 나는 얼마 받을까?

AI 웹 브라우저 출시로 웹 탐색의 미래가 바뀔 준비가 되었고, 이는 구글의 광고 수익 모델에 큰 위협이 될 수 있습니다.\n\n\n \n요즘 웹 브라우저 없이 인터넷을 한다는 건 상상도 할 수 없죠?   저도 아침에 눈 뜨면 바로 브라우저부터 켜고 세상 소식을 확인하는 게 일상이에요. 그런데 혹시, 앞으로 우리가 쓰는 웹 브라우저가 지금과는 완전히 다른 모습이 될 수도 있다는 거 아시나요? OpenAI가 구글 크롬에 정면으로 도전하는 AI 웹 브라우저를 출시할 예정이라고 해요. 이게 진짜 현실이 되면 우리의 웹 경험이 얼마나 달라질지, 구글은 또 어떤 영향을 받게 될지 함께 파헤쳐 볼까요?  \n \nOpenAI의 새로운 도전: AI 웹 브라우저 출시 임박!  \nOpenAI가 구글 크롬에 도전하는 AI 기반 웹 브라우저를 몇 주 안에 출시할 예정이라고 해요. 로이터 통신에 따르면, 이 브라우저는 인공지능(AI)을 활용해서 사용자의 웹 탐색 방식을 근본적으로 바꿀 목표를 가지고 있대요.  \n이 소식이 왜 중요할까요? 사실상 이 브라우저를 통해 OpenAI가 구글의 핵심 사업인 사용자 데이터에 더 직접적으로 접근할 수 있게 되는 거거든요. 구글이 사용자 데이터를 수집하고 그걸로 효과적인 광고 타겟팅을 해서 수익을 내는 방식에 큰 영향을 줄 수 있다는 얘기죠.\n  알아두세요!\n현재 ChatGPT의 주간 활성 사용자 수는 무려 4억 명에 달한다고 합니다. 만약 이 사용자들이 OpenAI의 새 브라우저로 넘어간다면, 구글 광고 수익에 엄청난 압박이 가해질 수 있어요.\n \n구글에게 위협이 되는 이유  \n구글 크롬은 단순한 웹 브라우저가 아니에요. 구글이 사용자 데이터를 수집하고 이를 활용해서 더 효과적이고 수익성 높은 광고를 타겟팅할 수 있게 돕는 핵심 수단이죠.  ️‍♀️ 알파벳의 광고 사업은 전체 매출의 약 4분의 3을 차지할 정도니, 이 부분이 흔들리면 구글 입장에서는 정말 큰일이겠죠?\nOpenAI의 브라우저는 기존 웹사이트 클릭 방식 대신 ChatGPT와 유사한 채팅 인터페이스 내에서 일부 사용자 상호작용을 처리하도록 설계되었다고 해요. 이건 단순히 브라우저가 바뀌는 걸 넘어, 우리가 웹과 소통하는 방식 자체를 바꿀 수도 있다는 의미예요!\n웹 브라우저 시장 현황 (2025년 기준)\n브라우저\n시장 점유율 (StatCounter)\n주요 특징\n비고\n\n\n\n\n구글 크롬\n3분의 2 이상 (30억+ 사용자)\n높은 점유율, 구글 서비스 통합, 광고 수익 핵심\n미 법무부 독점 소송 진행 중\n\n\n애플 사파리\n16%\nApple 생태계 통합, 개인정보 보호 강조\niOS/macOS 기기 사용자 위주\n\n\nOpenAI AI 브라우저\n신규 출시 예정\nAI 기반 채팅 인터페이스, 웹 작업 자동화, 크로미움 기반\nChatGPT 4억 명 사용자 전환 기대\n\n\n기타 AI 브라우저 (Operator, Brave, Comet 등)\n낮은 점유율\nAI 기반 작업 수행, 특정 기능 특화\n경쟁 심화 중\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n구글 크롬은 현재 전 세계 브라우저 시장의 3분의 2 이상을 점유하고 있으며, 사용자 수는 30억 명이 넘어요. 이 막강한 시장 지위 때문에 구글은 미국 법무부로부터 온라인 검색 시장 독점적 지위에 대한 분할 명령을 요청받기도 했답니다.\n \nAI 웹 브라우저, 어떻게 우리의 웹 경험을 바꿀까?  \nOpenAI의 브라우저는 단순히 웹 페이지를 보여주는 걸 넘어, AI 에이전트 제품인 'Operator'를 브라우저 경험에 직접 통합할 수 있게 될 거예요. 이게 무슨 말이냐고요? 쉽게 말해, AI가 사용자를 대신해서 웹사이트에서 예약하거나 양식을 작성하는 등의 작업을 수행해줄 수 있다는 거죠. 와, 상상만 해도 편할 것 같지 않나요?  \nAI 기반 웹 탐색의 새로운 기능들 ✨\n스마트한 정보 요약: 긴 기사를 읽을 시간이 없다고요? AI가 핵심 내용을 쏙쏙 뽑아 요약해줄 거예요.\n자동 양식 작성: 회원가입이나 복잡한 주문서 작성, 이제 AI에게 맡기세요! 한 번 입력된 정보는 똑똑하게 자동 완성됩니다.\n개인 맞춤형 웹 서핑: 사용자의 관심사를 파악해서 맞춤형 콘텐츠나 쇼핑 아이템을 추천해주는 건 물론, 불필요한 광고는 걸러줄지도 몰라요.\n음성 명령으로 웹 제어: 키보드나 마우스 없이 음성만으로 웹 서핑을 하고, 원하는 작업을 실행할 수 있게 될 거예요.\n이처럼 AI 브라우저는 우리의 디지털 라이프를 훨씬 더 효율적이고 편리하게 만들어줄 잠재력을 가지고 있답니다. 상상만 해도 기대되지 않나요?  \n \n치열한 경쟁 속 OpenAI의 전략  ‍ ‍ \nOpenAI는 웹 브라우저 출시 외에도 다양한 전략을 추진하고 있어요. 지난 5월에는 애플의 전 디자인 책임자 조니 아이브가 이끄는 AI 하드웨어 스타트업 'io'를 65억 달러에 인수하며 하드웨어 시장 진출도 선언했습니다. 단순히 소프트웨어뿐만 아니라 하드웨어까지 아우르는 큰 그림을 그리고 있는 거죠.  \nOpenAI는 기존 브라우저에 플러그인 형태로 붙이는 대신 자체 브라우저를 개발하기로 결정했는데, 이는 사용자 데이터를 보다 자유롭게 수집하기 위한 선택이라고 소식통들은 전했습니다. 사용자 데이터를 많이 확보할수록 AI 모델을 더 고도화할 수 있으니, 아주 중요한 전략적인 움직임이라고 볼 수 있겠네요.\n  알아두세요!\nOpenAI는 작년에 구글 크롬 초기 개발팀의 핵심 멤버였던 부사장 두 명을 채용했는데, 이때부터 이미 브라우저 개발을 염두에 뒀을 가능성이 높다고 합니다.\n \n실전 예시: AI 브라우저가 바꿔놓을 일상  \nAI 브라우저가 현실화되면 우리의 일상은 어떻게 바뀔까요? 제가 한번 상상해봤어요.  \n사례 주인공의 상황: 바쁜 직장인 김대리  \n김대리는 출장 준비로 항공권, 숙소 예약, 현지 맛집 검색 등 할 일이 산더미였어요.\n게다가 출장지 정보를 빠르게 요약하고 보고서에 필요한 자료도 찾아야 했죠.\nAI 브라우저를 통한 해결 과정  \n1) 첫 번째 단계: 김대리는 AI 브라우저에 \"다음 주 도쿄 출장 항공권이랑 호텔 예약해줘. 현지에서 유명한 라멘집 리스트도 찾아줘\"라고 음성으로 명령했어요.  \n2) 두 번째 단계: AI 브라우저는 즉시 여러 사이트에서 최저가 항공권과 최적의 호텔을 예약하고, 라멘집 정보를 지도와 함께 정리해 보여줬습니다. 동시에 출장지에 대한 최신 뉴스 기사를 요약해서 보고서 초안까지 작성해줬죠.  \n최종 결과  \n- 김대리는 출장 준비에 드는 시간을 기존의 10분의 1 수준으로 줄일 수 있었습니다.\n- 반복적이고 귀찮은 작업 대신 핵심 업무에 더 집중할 수 있게 되었어요.\n이처럼 AI 브라우저는 우리의 디지털 라이프를 훨씬 더 효율적이고 편리하게 만들어줄 잠재력을 가지고 있답니다. 상상만 해도 기대되지 않나요?  \n \n마무리: 웹의 새로운 시대를 향하여  \nOpenAI의 AI 웹 브라우저 출시는 단순한 신제품 출시를 넘어, 인터넷 세상의 판도를 바꿀 만한 큰 사건이 될 것 같아요. 구글 크롬이라는 거대한 산을 넘어야 하는 쉽지 않은 도전이겠지만, AI 기술의 발전 속도를 생각하면 불가능한 일도 아니겠죠.\n앞으로 어떤 AI 브라우저가 우리의 디지털 일상을 점령하게 될지, 그리고 구글은 이 변화에 어떻게 대응할지 정말 궁금해지네요!   더 궁금한 점이 있다면 댓글로 물어봐주세요~  \n \n \nOpenAI AI 브라우저 핵심 요약\n✨ 새로운 도전: 구글 크롬에 도전하는 AI 웹 브라우저 출시 임박! AI를 활용한 웹 탐색 방식의 혁신을 목표로 합니다.\n  구글의 위협: 구글의 광고 수익 모델에 직접적인 압박! ChatGPT의 4억 명 사용자 기반이 큰 영향력을 가질 수 있습니다.\n  작동 방식:\nAI 에이전트(Operator) 통합으로 웹 작업 자동화\n ‍  미래 전략: 하드웨어 시장 진출 및 사용자 데이터 확보에 집중! 웹 경험의 전반적인 변화를 예고합니다.\nOpenAI의 AI 브라우저는 웹 사용 방식을 혁신하며, 구글과의 치열한 경쟁을 예고하고 있습니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: OpenAI의 AI 웹 브라우저는 언제 출시되나요?\nA: 로이터 통신에 따르면 몇 주 안에 출시될 예정이라고 합니다.\nQ: 이 브라우저가 구글 크롬에 위협이 되는 주된 이유는 무엇인가요?\nA: OpenAI가 사용자 데이터에 직접 접근할 수 있게 되어, 구글의 핵심 광고 수익 모델에 큰 압박을 가할 수 있기 때문입니다. 특히 ChatGPT의 방대한 사용자 기반이 잠재적인 위협으로 작용할 수 있습니다.\nQ: AI 웹 브라우저는 기존 브라우저와 어떤 점이 다른가요?\nA: 일부 사용자 상호작용을 ChatGPT와 유사한 채팅 인터페이스 내에서 처리하며, AI 에이전트를 통해 웹사이트 내 예약, 양식 작성 등의 작업을 자동화할 수 있는 것이 가장 큰 차이점입니다.\nQ: OpenAI가 웹 브라우저를 개발하는 궁극적인 목표는 무엇인가요?\nA: 소비자의 일상 및 업무 생활 전반에 자사 AI 서비스를 통합하려는 광범위한 전략의 일환이며, 이를 통해 더 많은 사용자 데이터를 확보하여 AI 모델을 고도화하려는 목적도 있습니다.\nQ: OpenAI가 브라우저 시장에서 구글 크롬의 지배력을 깰 수 있을까요?\nA: 현재 구글 크롬이 압도적인 시장 점유율을 가지고 있어 쉽지 않은 도전이 예상되지만, OpenAI의 혁신적인 AI 기술과 사용자 기반을 바탕으로 경쟁이 심화될 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n\n{\n    \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n    \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n    \"mainEntity\": [\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"OpenAI의 AI 웹 브라우저는 언제 출시되나요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"  로이터 통신에 따르면 몇 주 안에 출시될 예정이라고 합니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"이 브라우저가 구글 크롬에 위협이 되는 주된 이유는 무엇인가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"  OpenAI가 사용자 데이터에 직접 접근할 수 있게 되어, 구글의 핵심 광고 수익 모델에 큰 압박을 가할 수 있기 때문입니다. 특히 ChatGPT의 방대한 사용자 기반이 잠재적인 위협으로 작용할 수 있습니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"AI 웹 브라우저는 기존 브라우저와 어떤 점이 다른가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"  일부 사용자 상호작용을 ChatGPT와 유사한 채팅 인터페이스 내에서 처리하며, AI 에이전트를 통해 웹사이트 내 예약, 양식 작성 등의 작업을 자동화할 수 있는 것이 가장 큰 차이점입니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"OpenAI가 웹 브라우저를 개발하는 궁극적인 목표는 무엇인가요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"  소비자의 일상 및 업무 생활 전반에 자사 AI 서비스를 통합하려는 광범위한 전략의 일환이며, 이를 통해 더 많은 사용자 데이터를 확보하여 AI 모델을 고도화하려는 목적도 있습니다.\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"@type\": \"Question\",\n            \"name\": \"OpenAI가 브라우저 시장에서 구글 크롬의 지배력을 깰 수 있을까요?\",\n            \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"  현재 구글 크롬이 압도적인 시장 점유율을 가지고 있어 쉽지 않은 도전이 예상되지만, OpenAI의 혁신적인 AI 기술과 사용자 기반을 바탕으로 경쟁이 심화될 것으로 보입니다.\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "바로 이전 포스팅에서 말했듯이, 나는 요새 기술이 아무리 발전하고, 세상이 바뀌더라도, 바뀌지 않는 것들에 대해 고민하고, 그쪽을 꽤 많이 보고 있다. 이렇게 조금 다른 각도로 시장을 보면, 잘 안 바뀌는 분야가 생각보다 많은데, 먹는 것, 바르는 것, 입는 것이 대표적이다. 아무리 터미네이터와 같은 휴머노이드가 길거리에 사람같이 돌아다녀도, 우린 계속 밥은 먹어야 하고, 얼굴과 몸에 뭔가를 발라야 하고, 계절에 맞는 옷을 입어야 한다. 몇 년 전에 DTC, 브랜드, 이커머스가 크게 유행하던 때가 있었고, 이때 엄청나게 많은 VC 돈이 이 분야에 투입됐는데, 돈 벌기가 너무 힘들다는 이유로 요샌 대부분의 VC에게 철저하게 외면당하고 있다.\n나는 이 분야가 돈 벌기가 힘든 이유는 너무 많은 플레이어가 비슷한 사업을 하고 있기 때문이지, 시장 자체가 돈을 못 버는 습성이 있기 때문은 절대로 아니라고 생각한다. 그리고 이런 논리로 시장과 회사에 접근하면, 그 어떤 분야에도 투자할 수가 없다. 이 세상에서 돈 벌기 쉬운 분야와 사업은 없기 때문이다.\n이런 요새 분위기와는 정반대로 우린 최근에 이 먹고 마시고, 바르고, 입는 분야에 꽤 활발하게 투자하고 있다. 소프트웨어 사업보다 성장의 기울기가 전반적으로 완만하고, 계속 뭔가를 만들어 팔아야 하므로 한계비용을 낮출 순 있어도 0으로 내릴 순 없고, 어느 정도 수준까지 도달하기 전에는 자본 집약적이라는 꼬리표를 피할 수 없지만, 그래도 손으로 만질 수 있는 제품을 만들어서 판매한다는 점에선 아주 단순하고, 아주 훌륭한 사업이라고 생각한다.\n2025년 1사분기에 유니콘이 된 Top 10 글로벌 신생 유니콘 중 7개가 AI 관련 스타트업인데, AI가 주 사업이 아닌 나머지 3개 중 유독 내 눈에 띈 회사는 OLIPOP이라는 미국의 프리바이오틱 음료수 회사다. 이 회사의 2023년 매출은 약 2,500억 원이고, 2024년 매출은 이보다 더 클 것이다. 유니콘 기업가치는 약 2.5조 원이었다. 매출의 10배 정도의 밸류에이션을 인정받은 건데, 이 배수는 내가 지난 몇 년 동안 봐왔던 먹고, 마시고, 입는 제품을 만드는 회사들의 기업가치와 어느 정도 비슷한 것 같고, 이 분야 스타트업의 성공을 위한 magic number는 연 매출 1,000억 원인 것 같다. 매출 1,000억 원을 하면 대부분 5,000억 원 이상의 기업가치에 투자를 받거나, 1조 원 이상의 기업가치에 더 큰 회사에 인수되는 사례를 최근 몇 년 동안 여러 번 봤기 때문이다.\n매출 1,000억 원은 어떤 의미일까?\n일단 엄청나게 큰 매출이다. 일반 사람들이 먹고 마시고 바르고 입는 제품의 단가가 그렇게 비싸지 않다는 걸 감안하면, 엄청나게 많이 팔아야지 매출 1,000억 원을 달성할 수 있다. 그리고 이 정도 매출을 하면 꽤 의미 있는 규모의 소비자들이 이 제품에 대해 이야기한다. 예를 들면, 프리바이오틱 소다에 대해 이야기하면 10명 중 4명은 위에서 말한 OLIPOP의 브랜드를 떠올릴 것이다.\n또한, 매출 1,000억 원을 해서 많은 사람들에게 회자되기 시작하면, 그 분야를 수십 년 ~ 수백 년 동안 장악하고 있는 공룡인 대기업들에게 조금씩 거슬리는 존재가 된다. 아직까진 경쟁사는 아니지만, 대기업이 뭐만 하려고 하면 이 작은 회사의 이름이 언급되면서 굉장히 불편하고 짜증 나는 존재로 강하게 인식되기 시작한다. 내가 이 블로그에서도 몇 번 언급했는데, 마하트가 간디의 명언 중 하나인, “처음엔 사람들이 당신을 무시할 것이고, 그다음엔 당신을 비웃을 것이고, 다음엔 당신과 싸울 것이고, 그러고 나서 당신은 이길 것이다”에서 대기업들이 1,000억 매출 하는 스타트업을 대하는 자세는 “다음엔 당신과 싸울 것이다” 바로 그 직전의 상태가 아닐까 싶다.\n그리고 대부분 이 시점에서 그 분야 1,2등 회사가 1,000억 원 매출의 대략 10배인 1조 원 정도의 가격에 회사를 인수한다. 이 정도까지 매출을 키운 브랜드라면, 대기업이 가진 자원과 유통 채널을 활용하면 장기적으론 이보다 훨씬 더 큰 브랜드로 성장시킬 수 있기 때문이다. 그리고 아마도 이게 가능하고, 정말로 인수 이후 훨씬 더 큰 브랜드가 되는 사례가 많은 이유는 먹고, 마시고, 바르고, 입는 산업에서는 유통이 가장 막강한 권력이고 큰 회사가 작은 회사보다 항상 잘하는 게 이 유통이기 때문이다.\n한국은 미국보다 시장이 작다. 많이 작다. 하지만, 이제 우리의 TAM(Total Addressable Market)은 한국의 5,000만 명의 잠재 소비자보다 훨씬 더 큰 글로벌 시장이다. 이미 한국이 만드는 먹는 것, 마시는 것, 바르는 것과 입는 것들은 해외 시장을 향해서 빠른 속도로 확장하고 있다. 이미 많이 있지만, 조만간 한국에도 매출 1,000억 원을 찍는 스타트업들이 더 많이 나오고, 더 많은 글로벌/한국 대기업들이 이 회사들을 높은 기업가치에 인수할 수 있길 바란다. 아니면, 스스로 계속 성장해서 이들이 대기업이 되고, 다른 스타트업을 높은 기업가치에 인수하고, 이 현상이 계속 반복될 수 있길 바란다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "스타트업이라는 단어를 생각하면 가장 먼저 떠오르는 이미지는 뭘까? 사람마다 다르겠지만, 아마도 대부분 혁신과 변화라는 말이 떠오르지 않을까 싶다. 우리가 아는 주변의 많은 스타트업이 무에서 유를 만들었고, 이 과정에서 현상 유지가 잘 되던 현재 상황을 완전히 엎어버리고 새로운 미래를 만들었다. 이들은 미래를 변화시키고, 동시에 새로운 미래를 만들고 있다.\n우리 같은 VC는 이런 스타트업을 계속 찾고 있다. 창업가를 만났는데, 감동이 깊었고, 이들이 그리는 혁신에 동의해서 투자하는 때도 있지만, 이런 bottom up 전략과 반대로 앞으로 10년 후에 어떤 변화가 일어날지, 지금 사는 세상에 비해 뭐가 달라질지 예측하고, 이 분야에서 재미있는 걸 하고 있는 창업가를 찾아서 투자하는 top down 전략을 추구하는 때도 있다. 특히 요샌 많은 VC들이 AI가 앞으로 바꿀 세상을 상상하고 예측하면서, 이 예측과 같은 선상에서 사업하는 스타트업을 찾아서 투자하려고 엄청나게 노력하고 있다.\n우리도 크게 다르진 않다. 앞으로 10년 동안 우리가 현재 당연하게 매일 사용하는 제품이나 서비스 중 어떤 것들이 크게 바뀔지 상상의 나래를 펼쳐 보고, 이 상상을 현실로 만들어 줄 수 있는 창업가들을 찾으려고 한다. 그런데 나는 AI가 메인스트림이 됐던 시점부터, 약간 다른 관점에서 시장을 보는 노력을 하기 시작했다. 요새 나는 매일매일 스스로에게 하는 질문이 있는데, 그건 바로 “앞으로 10년, 20년이 지나도 지금과 똑같이 거의 안 바뀌는 제품, 서비스, 시장은 어떤 게 있을까?”이다.\n실은 이건 아마존의 제프 베조스에게 힌트를 얻은 질문인데, 지금 내 주위의 모든 VC들이 바라보는 방향과는 완전히 반대 방향을 볼 수 있는 역발상적인 영감을 주는 질문이다. 역발상적이긴 하지만, 전 세계 모든 사람들이 변화만을 보고, 변화만을 상상하고, 변화 만에 투자하고 있어서, 쉽지 않은 고민이기도 하다. 하지만, 오히려 변하지 않을 확률이 높은 곳에 우리만 투자해서 우리만 맞을 때 경험할 수 있는 짜릿함과 벌 수 있는 수익은 훨씬 높다. 내가 봤을 땐.\n어떤 것들이 앞으로도 안 변할까? 솔직히 나도 잘 모르겠지만, 아마도 기계나 인공지능이 완벽하게 대체하기가 정말 어려운 것들이 이 분야에 포함되지 않을까 생각한다. 그리고 이런, 앞으로 변하지 않을 분야의 중심엔 결국엔 사람이 있는 것 같다. 변화, 그리고 변화로 인한 변수에 너무 익숙한 직업이고 만나는 사람마다 변화와 혁신을 외치기 때문에 잘 안 바뀌는 상수에 관한 생각을 우린 너무 안 하는 것 같은데, 어쩌면 오래 지속될 수 있는 사업은 오랫동안 변하지 않는 아이디어, 컨셉, 시장, 제품을 기반으로 더 쉽게 만들어질 수 있을지도 모른다. 그리고 너무 빨리 변하는 세상을 바꾸는 기술이나 변수를 기반으로 제품을 만들다 보면, 출시 시점에 그 시장이 이미 없어졌을 수도 있다. 우린 이런 걸 유행이라고 하는데, 유행을 좇다 아무것도 못 만드는 창업가들을 너무 많이 봤고, 이들을 좇다 돈을 다 날린 투자자들도 너무 많이 봤다.\n어차피 사업과 투자엔 정답은 없다. 하지만, 가끔은 변수만 보지 말고 상수에도 집중할 필요가 있다.",

송슬옹 대표에게 물었습니다. “소중한 사람이 떠나면, 저는 가장 먼저 무슨 일을 해야 하나요?”\n송슬옹 대표는 '값비싼 장례가 아닌, 마음이 담긴 작별'을 꿈꾸며 장례 업계 최초로 가격 정찰제를 도입해 투명한 장례 문화를 선도하고 있습니다. 그가 전해준 장례의 풍경과 슬픔 속에서도 반드시 거쳐야 하는 절차들은 생각보다 훨씬 구체적이고 현실적이었습니다. 소중한 사람의 마지막을 혼란 없이 마주하기 위해, 더 나아가서는 나의 죽음 뒤 남겨질 이들을 위한 가장 실제적인 이야기를 전합니다.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}소중한 사람이 떠난 직후 \n2시간 안에 해야 할 일들\nQ. 가족이 세상을 떠났을 때, 가장 먼저 마주하게 되는 현실은 어떤 모습인가요?\n유족이 가장 먼저 마주하는 건 감정이 아니라 결정이에요. 많은 분들이 ‘장례는 3일이다’라고 생각하시지만, 그 3일 중에서 정신없는 건 처음 2시간입니다. 이 시점에 어떤 결정을 하느냐에 따라 장례의 방향이 완전히 달라지기도 합니다. 장례의 시작을 위해 유족이 결정해야 하는 일은 크게 네 가지입니다.\n첫 번째로 가장 먼저 해야 하는 건 사망진단서 또는 검안서를 받는 일입니다. 병원에서 돌아가셨다면 의사에게 진단서를 요청하면 되고, 자택이나 요양시설에서 사망하셨다면 112나 지정된 검안의를 불러야 합니다. 이 서류는 장례식장 접수는 물론이고, 화장 신청, 사망신고, 보험 청구, 금융 해지 같은 행정 절차 전반에 필요하기 때문에 반드시 여러 부(7부 이상) 받아두는 게 좋습니다.\n만약 사인이 불분명하다면 부검 또는 경찰 신고가 필요한 경우도 있어요. 사망진단서에 '외인사', '기타 및 불상' 같은 표현이 있는 경우 '의사와 검사가 시신을 검안하여 유가족에게 인계할 때 발급하는 사망 증명서'인 검시필증을 발급받아야 합니다. 이를 위해 경찰과 연결되고 조사 절차를 거쳐야 하죠.\n두 번째는 시신을 어디로 옮길지를 정해야 해요. 이 결정이 곧 장례식장 선택으로 이어지기 때문에 굉장히 중요합니다. 많은 분들이 돌아가신 병원 부속 장례식장에 자연스럽게 안치하는데, 사실 꼭 그래야 하는 건 아니에요. 종교적 이유나 예산, 가족 구성원들의 이동 거리 등을 고려해서 별도로 장례식장을 선택할 수도 있어요.\n세 번째는 누가 장례를 주관할지 정하는 것입니다. 이는 가족 중 누가 서류에 도장을 찍고, 장례식장 직원과 소통할지를 정하는 문제예요. 초기에 합의가 안 되면, 빈소 계약을 못 하고 2시간씩 대기하는 경우도 생깁니다. 저희가 현장에서 간혹 보는 갈등 중 하나예요. 가족이 많거나, 이혼·재혼 등 가족구성이 복잡할수록 반드시 짚고 넘어가야 하는 부분입니다.\n마지막으로 꼭 잊지 말아야 할 게 화장장 예약이에요. 많은 분들이 빈소를 먼저 정하고 발인 일정을 짠 뒤, 화장을 예약하는데, 순서가 바뀌면 낭패를 봐요. 전국 화장장은 예약이 빽빽해서 자리가 없을 수도 있고, 예약이 밀리면 장례일을 하루 더 늘려야 할 수도 있거든요. 이렇게 되면 비용이 수십만 원 단위로 더 들어가는 경우도 있고요.\n이 4가지 일들이 장례를 시작하기 위해 꼭 필요한 일들입니다. 가족 구성원 중 한 사람은 반드시 감정을 눌러놓고 실무를 처리해야만 해요. 준비된 사람이 있는지 없는지에 따라, 남은 가족들의 감정 회복에도 큰 차이가 생기더라고요.\nQ. ‘삼일장’이라는 말은 익숙하지만, 막상 3일 동안 어떤 일들이 어떻게 진행되는지는 잘 떠오르지 않더라고요. 하루하루 어떤 절차들이 진행되는지, 전체적인 흐름을 짚어주실 수 있을까요?\n날마다 해야 할 일이 꽤 명확하게 정해져 있어요. 유족 입장에서 보면 마치 체크리스트처럼 움직이게 되죠.\n1일 차에는 사망진단서를 발급받고, 시신을 장례식장으로 옮긴 뒤 빈소를 마련합니다. 빈소 세팅이 끝나면 조문객을 맞이하기 시작하고, 상조업체, 장례식장 측과 입관식·발인 일정, 장지 등을 협의합니다. 이때 지인들에게 부고를 보내고 제단꽃과 영정사진을 정하게 됩니다. 영정사진을 급하게 준비하게 되면 속상한 일이 있을 수 있기 때문에 사진을 미리 골라두면 좋습니다. 이날은 고인을 안치 냉장 시설에 모셔만 두고, 아직 입관*은 하지 않습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*관에 모시는 의식\n2일 차에는 두 가지만 기억하시면 됩니다. 바로 입관과 조문입니다. 고인의 몸을 씻기고 수의를 입히는 염습 절차를 거쳐, 관에 모시는 입관식이 진행됩니다. 보통 장례식 2일 차 오전~낮 사이에 진행되며, 가족이 참관할 수 있어요. 입관식은 장례 전 과정 중 가장 상징적이고 감정적인 순간 중 하나입니다. 관에 들어가시기 전에 마지막으로 얼굴을 보고 생전에 못다 했던 말들을 전하는 시간이기 때문이죠. 조문도 본격화됩니다. 둘째 날은 조문객 응대, 부의금 정리 등 가장 분주한 날이기도 합니다.\n3일 차에는 발인을 합니다. 보통 이른 아침 6~7시경에 발인이 시작돼요. 발인은 고인이 생전에 살던 집과 가족들로부터 떠나가는 의식을 말하는데요. 집에서 장례를 진행했던 예전과는 달리 현대에는 ‘관을 장례식장에서 장지로 운구하는 행위’를 뜻하게 되었습니다. 그래서 장례식장에서 간단한 추모의식을 한 뒤, 고인을 화장장이나 매장지로 모십니다. 요즘은 화장을 선택하는 경우가 많고, 화장장 예약 시간에 맞춰 전반적인 일정이 결정돼요. 화장 후 유골은 봉안당에 모시거나, 유택동산*이나 바다에 뿌리기도 합니다. 모든 절차가 끝나는 시간은 장지 위치에 따라 다르지만, 대체로 정오~오후 사이에 마무리됩니다.\n*고인의 유골을 뿌릴 수 있는 지정된 장소를 말한다. 전국 대부분의 화장장에는 유택동산이 설치되어 있다.\n700만 원에서 4,000만 원 그 이상까지\n장례 비용 가르는 4가지 요소\nQ. 여러 통계를 보면 장례식 평균 비용은 1,300만 원에서 2,000만 원 이상까지 이야기됩니다. 장례 비용은 어떤 항목들로 구성되나요?\n장례를 진행하면서 돈을 내야 하는 곳은 크게 세 군데라고 보시면 됩니다. 상조회사, 장례식장, 그리고 장지.\n먼저 상조회사가 있어요. 상조는 장례를 치를 때 필요한 기본적인 인력, 차량, 용품을 패키지처럼 묶어서 제공합니다. 장례지도사, 음식 도우미, 고인을 이송할 앰뷸런스, 발인할 때 타는 버스나 리무진 같은 차량, 그리고 관이나 수의 같은 장례용품이 여기에 포함돼요. 이 비용이 보통 200만 원대에서, 많게는 500만 원 이상까지도 나옵니다. 만약 상조 없이 진행한다면, 이 항목들을 개별적으로 장례식장에 요청해서 처리하게 되는데요. 결국 비슷한 비용이 들며, 상황에 따라 더 많은 비용이 들 수도 있습니다.\n두 번째는 장례식장에 지급하는 비용입니다. 장례식장 비용은 크게 두가지로 나뉘는데요. 하나는 공간 사용료, 그러니까 빈소, 접객실, 안치실을 이틀 정도 사용하는 데 드는 돈이고요. 다른 하나는 음식 비용이에요. 조문객들 식사와 술, 제사 음식까지 포함하면 꽤 큰 금액이 나옵니다. 이 두 가지를 합치면 저렴하게는 500만 원, 많게는 1,000만 원 이상이 나올 수 있어요. 특히 조문객 수가 많을수록 음식 비용이 금방 올라가요.\n마지막은 장지 비용, 고인을 모시는 장소에 드는 돈이에요. 장지 비용은 다시 두 단계로 나뉘어요. 우선 1차 장지라고 하는 화장장입니다. 고인의 주소지 관할(관내)에서 화장을 하면 10만 원 내외 정도인데, 다른 지역(관외)에서 하면 몇십만 원으로 확 뛰어요. 많게는 10배 차이가 나기도 해요. 그래서 고인의 주소지를 꼭 확인하고, 관내 화장장을 먼저 알아보는 게 중요합니다.\n그다음은 2차 장지입니다. 2차 장지는 화장 후 유골을 모시는 곳, 즉 봉안당이나 수목장 같은 안치 시설이에요. 2차 장지는 앞으로 십 년 이상 모셔야 하는 곳이기 때문에, 자리 사용료뿐만 아니라 관리비도 감안해야 합니다. 위치나 시설에 따라 금액 차이가 크지만, 보통 봉안당은 평균 600만 원 내외, 수목장은 평균 700만 원 내외입니다.\n이렇게 세 군데를 기준으로 보면, 장례 비용이 왜 그렇게 나오는지 좀 더 이해가 쉬워지실 거예요. 장례 비용이라는 것이 가족의 상황마다 천차만별이라 금액을 딱 짚어서 말씀드리기가 어려운데요. 이 세 가지가 각각 전체 비용의 3분의 1씩 차지한다고 생각하면 되겠습니다.\nQ. 같은 삼일장인데도 누군가는 천만 원 이하로, 누군가는 수천만 원이 든다고 하잖아요. 어떤 선택들이 비용 차이를 크게 만드나요?\n비용 차이를 크게 만드는 선택은 몇 가지로 정리할 수 있어요. 첫 번째는 빈소를 어디에 차릴지예요. 대형 병원 장례식장은 위치도 좋고 시설도 좋지만, 아무래도 비용이 높습니다. 반면 공설 장례식장은 훨씬 저렴해요. 같은 2일 대여인데도 수십만 원에서, 많게는 백만 원 넘게 차이 날 수 있거든요. 여기에 접객실, 안치실 사용료도 다 따로 붙어요.\n두 번째는 조문객 음식이에요. 보통 1인당 2만 원 내외 정도로 계산되는데요. 50명만 와도 100만 원 가까이 되고, 100명 넘으면 음식값만 몇 백만 원이 됩니다. 거기에 술, 추가 주문이 붙으면 더 올라가고요.\n세 번째는 상조회사에서 제공받는 패키지입니다. 간소하게 준비를 한다고 하면 차량, 관, 수의 등의 용품을 200만 원 내로 진행할 수 있지만, 고급 용품을 사용하면 500만 원도 들어갈 수 있습니다. 그중에서 특히 수의와 유골함이 가장 가격 편차가 큽니다. 수의는 생전에 즐겨 입으시던 옷, 유골함은 목함을 사용한다면 비용이 거의 들지 않지만 가장 비싼 것만 고른다면 수의, 유골함이 각각 수백만 원대입니다.\n마지막으로 장지입니다. 사실 이게 비용 차이가 제일 커요. 화장 후에 유골을 납골당에 안치하지 않고, 유택동산에 뿌린다면 거의 비용이 들지 않지만, 비싼 업체와 위치를 선택할 경우 수천만 원도 들어갈 수도 있습니다.\n수목장은 한 그루 안에 여러 위*가 모셔지는 경우에는 200만 원 정도이며, 큰 나무에 혼자 혹은 소수의 가족들만 모셔지는 경우 4,000만 원에 이르기도 합니다. 시신 화장 후 유골을 모시는 봉안당도 마찬가지인데요. 사람의 눈높이에 해당하는 층은 시설 좋은 곳의 경우 1,500만 원 정도, 반면에 선호도가 낮은 곳은 150만 원 가량입니다. 같은 장례라도 선택에 따라 전체 비용이 700만 원 선에서 끝나기도 하고, 수천만 원을 훌쩍 넘기기도 합니다.\n*돌아가신 분을 세는 단위\nQ. 장례를 최대한 간소하게 하면서도 의미는 지키고 싶어 하는 분들도 많아졌습니다. 꼭 필요한 것과 덜어내도 괜찮은 것들을 나눠본다면, 어떤 기준이 있을까요?\n사실 대부분 덜어내도 됩니다. 장례에서 결국 중요한 것은 추모하는 마음과 가족간의 의미이지, 형식이 아니니까요. 현실적이면서 간소하게 진행하길 원하는 분들이 일반적으로 선택하는 걸 말씀드려보자면, 추가 결제를 유도하지 않는 합리적인 후불식 상조에 공설 장례식장, 그리고 화장 후 유골을 유택동산에 산분장*으로 간소하게 진행하는 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 전체 장례 비용 700만 원 안팎까지 내려갑니다.\n*화장한 유골을 자연 환경에 뿌리는 것. ‘유택동산에 산분장으로 모신다’는 것은 고인의 유골을 뿌릴 수 있는 지정된 장소에 골분을 뿌리는 것을 뜻한다.\n사실 장례식에서 정말 필요한 것을 엄밀하게 따져보면 딱 세 가지밖에 없어요. 먼저 고인의 시신을 돌아가신 직후에 바로 안치하는 일, 이건 피할 수가 없습니다. 반드시 안치 냉장 시설이 있는 장례식장에 모셔야만 해요.\n두 번째는 입관하는 절차예요. 시신을 관에 모시는 일은 법적으로도, 현실적으로도 필수입니다. 아무리 간소하게 해도 이 과정 자체를 생략할 수는 없어요. 간혹 사망 후 입관 없이 바로 화장을 할 수 없겠냐고 여쭤보는 분들이 계시는데요. 법적으로 사망 후 24시간 이내에는 화장하는 것이 금지되어 있습니다.\n세 번째는 화장이에요. 비싼 매장으로 진행할 것이 아니라면 화장 자체는 필수적이고, 화장터까지 이동하려면 관을 옮기는 차량도 반드시 필요합니다. 이 역시 현실적으로 생략이 불가능하죠.\n즉, 빈소 사용료, 음식 비용, 제단 꾸미는 비용, 수의와 유골함 같은 용품들은 생략할 수 있습니다. 실제로 최근 장례 비용을 최소화해서 진행하는 분들도 점점 늘어나고 있습니다.\nQ. 장례를 치르다 보면 가족 간 갈등이 생기거나, 어려움을 겪는 경우가 많습니다. 갈등을 줄이려면 어떤 부분들을 미리 조율해 두는 게 좋을까요?\n아까 금액을 지급하는 곳이 세 곳(상조회사, 장례식장, 장지)이라고 말씀드렸는데요. 이 세 곳에 대한 결정이 결국 갈등 요소라고 볼 수 있을 것 같습니다.\n우선 가족끼리 가입해 둔 상조가 많으면 많을수록 갈등이 생기기 쉽습니다. 서로 어떤 상조를 쓸지 의견이 좁혀지지 않아서 임종 당일에 여러 곳의 업체가 동시에 출동하여 혼란을 빚는 일이 비일비재합니다. 각자 가입한 상조가 어디인지, 또 회사에서는 어떤 경조사 복지가 나오는지 충분히 파악하고 조율해야 혼란이 없습니다.\n그다음은 장례식장이 있겠네요. 가족들 입장에서는 약 이틀간 지낼 곳이기도 하고 조문객 입장에서는 멀리서 방문해야 하는 곳이기 때문에 위치나 시설 편의성을 고려해서 잘 조율하는 것이 중요합니다.\n하지만 장지가 제일 중요한데요. 장지는 식이 끝난 후에도 계속 방문해야 하는 곳이기 때문에 앞의 두 곳보다 더 충분히 대화하여 정하는 게 좋습니다. 특히 장지를 고를 때는 친척 어르신들과 젊은 상주 사이에 의견이 다를 수 있어요. 이 또한 비일비재한 갈등인데요.\n어르신들은 오래된 선산을 이야기하시지만, 결국은 고인을 가장 많이 찾아뵙게 될 가까운 가족이 판단해야 할 문제인 것 같습니다. 장지는 사전에 방문해서 상담하는 것도 가능하니 각자 거주하는 위치와 예산을 고려해서 충분한 시간을 갖고 알아보면 좋겠습니다.\nQ. 상조회사 가입 여부에 따라서는 어떤 차이가 있나요?\n상조회사 가입의 현실적인 장점은, 장례비용을 목돈으로 한 번에 지출하지 않아도 된다는 점입니다.\n가입자는 매월 소액씩 납부하며 비용 부담을 분산할 수 있고, 최근에는 장례뿐 아니라 웨딩, 크루즈 여행 등으로 전환 가능한 서비스를 포함한 상품도 많아져 가입 시 선택할 수 있는 옵션의 폭도 넓어졌습니다.\n그런데 사실 장례 서비스만 본다면, 가입 여부에 따라 현장에서 받는 서비스 자체는 큰 차이가 없습니다. 대부분의 상조회사는 미리 가입하지 않았더라도 임종 당일에 바로 전화하면 즉시 서비스를 제공해요. 그래서 미리 가입한 분이나 가입하지 않고 당일에 연락한 분이나 실제 장례 현장에서 누리는 서비스적 차이는 크지 않죠.\n오히려 상조회사 가입 여부보다 더 중요한 건 가족끼리 '장례를 어떻게 할지'에 대해 충분히 이야기가 되어 있는가 하는 점입니다. 가족들이 장례식의 방향성에 대해 미리 충분히 합의하지 않으면, 좋은 상조회사를 써도 혼란스럽고 비용도 더 들어가는 상황이 될 수 있어요.\n그리고 중요한 것이 또 있는데요. 아무리 가족이 원하는 장례를 이야기하더라도 상조에서 받아주지 않으면 할 수가 없어요. 예를 들어, 수의 대신 어머니가 생전에 좋아했던 옷을 입으시길 원한다 하더라도 상조가 ‘그렇게는 안 된다’라고 하면 진행할 수 없는 거죠. 가족이 원하는 요구사항을 받아들여 주는 상조를 찾는 것이 상조 가입 여부보다 더 중요합니다.\nQ. 상조회사를 고를 때, 어떤 기준으로 살펴보면 후회 없는 선택이 될까요?\n많은 분들이 유명하거나 광고를 많이 하는 상조회사를 선택하시는데, 사실 큰 회사라고 꼭 서비스가 더 좋은 건 아니에요. 중요한 건 그 상조회사가 장례 과정에서 어떤 것까지 직접 해주는지를 확인하는 거죠.\n그리고 내게 맞는 '규모'를 골라야 해요. 가족끼리 소규모로 조용하게 장례를 치르고 싶은데, 규모가 큰 회사에서 기본적으로 제안하는 상품을 쓰면 불필요하게 비용만 올라갈 수 있어요. 반대로, 조문객이 많은 경우인데 저렴한 소규모 패키지를 선택하면 결국 현장에서 추가 비용이 크게 늘어날 수도 있습니다.\n그래서 상조회사와 직접 상담해 보는 것도 중요합니다. 내게 맞는 적절한 상품을 추천해 주는 게 상조가 해야 할 일이거든요. 또 장례는 결국 사람이 사람에게 제공하는 서비스라서, 통화 한 번만 해봐도 이 회사가 어떤 태도로 고객을 대하는지 알 수 있어요. 아무리 상품이 좋아도 담당자의 태도가 불성실하거나 내 질문에 제대로 답을 못한다면, 실제 현장에서도 비슷한 일이 벌어질 가능성이 크다고 봅니다.\n결국 상조회사를 고를 때, 가장 현실적인 팁은 '그 회사가 나와 내 가족의 상황에 맞는 서비스 범위를 명확히 제시하고, 내 질문에 친절히 답할 수 있느냐'를 확인하는 겁니다. 이 두 가지만 확실히 해도 후회 없는 선택을 하실 수 있어요.\n어떻게 떠나보내고\n어떻게 기억할 것인가\nQ. 2025년 전국 평균 화장률이 90%를 넘으면서, 화장터 부족 현상도 뉴스에서 자주 마주치게 됩니다. 화장터 부족을 비롯해 지금 장례 인프라에는 어떤 문제들이 있나요?\n화장터 부족은 숫자만 봐도 분명한 문제입니다. 사망자가 조금이라도 급증하게 되면 화장 대기일이 길어져서 4일장을 치르는 시즌이 종종 생깁니다. 예를 들어, 서울만 해도 2024년 한 해 동안 사망자가 약 52,000명이었어요. 그런데 서울에서 1년에 처리하는 화장 건수는 50,000건이 안 됩니다. 사망자가 늘어나는 겨울철에는 4일장까지 가는 경우도 꽤 있어요.\n문제는 서울만의 일이 아닙니다. 대부분 지자체들이 자체 화장시설을 갖추고 있지 않거든요. 화장터가 없는 지역은 화장터가 있는 지역까지 소위 ‘원정 화장’을 가야 합니다. 고인을 보내는 마지막 길이 그렇게까지 힘들어야 하나 싶을 정도로요. 화장터 부족 문제가 해결되지 않으면 인구 구조상 앞으로 20~30년 동안 이 문제는 계속 이어질 거예요.\n화장도 중요하지만 그 이후도 문제입니다. 지금 공공 납골당이나 수목장은 거의 다 만실입니다. 특히 납골당보다는 수목장이 더 부족한데요. 2022년 인식 조사*에 따르면 10명 중 9명이 매장이 아닌 화장을 선호했고, 화장을 선호한 10명 중 4명은 수목장을 선호했어요. 수목장 수요는 계속 느는데 신규 시설은 지역 반대 때문에 새로 건립되기도 어렵습니다. 친환경적인 방식임에도 장례시설이기 때문에 혐오시설로 보는 거죠. 또 수목장은 필요로 하는 면적도 납골보다 훨씬 넓은데, 우리나라가 땅이 좁다 보니까 무조건적으로 공급하기 어렵다는 태생적인 문제도 있습니다.\n*보건복지부, 제 3차 장사시설 수급 종합계획 비전과 목표\nQ. 이런 문제들에 대해 사회적으로 어떤 논의나 대안들이 나오고 있는지도 궁금합니다.\n조금씩 개선되고 변하고 있는데요. 서울에 있는 화장터 두 곳은 ‘스마트 화장로’*를 도입해서 화장 시간을 20분씩 단축했고요. 전국의 많은 화장터들이 꾸준히 수요를 예측하고 화장로를 증설하거나, 노후 시설을 개보수하는 방식으로 대응하고 있습니다.\n*화장로 내부의 가스나 압력 등을 조정해 연소상태를 적정하게 유지할 수 있고, 화장 시간을 20분 정도 단축 및 연료 소모량도 기존 화장로 대비 30%정도 절감할 수 있다.\n또 2023년에는 보건복지부에서 2027년까지 자연장 14만 6,000구, 봉안시설 5만 7,000구를 늘린다는 계획을 추진했어요. 물론 실제 추진 속도나 지역 간 균형 면에서는 여전히 과제가 많지만, 적어도 인프라가 필요하다는 문제의식은 정책적으로 공유되고 있고, 방향성도 잡혀 있다는 점에서 의미가 있습니다.\nQ. 예전과 비교하면 장례 문화도 많이 달라진 것 같아요. 대표님께서 현장에서 느끼시는 요즘 장례의 흐름은 어떤가요?\n불과 5년, 10년 전까지만 하더라도 무빈소장은 수가 많지 않았습니다. 하지만 코로나19를 기점으로 무빈소장이 대중화되었다고 말씀드릴 수 있어요. 코로나 당시에는 사망자가 급증해 장례식장이 포화 상태가 되면서 일정을 간소하게 진행했고, 사회적 거리두기를 실행하면서 조문객도 빈소도 필요 없었거든요. 그 이후에 팬데믹은 끝났지만, 무빈소 혹은 장례를 가족끼리만 간소하게 치르고 싶다고 상담을 주시는 분들이 정말 많이 늘어났어요.\n또 합리성을 추구하는 분들이 점차 늘어가고 있는 거 같아요. 합리성이라는 것이 꼭 비용을 저렴하게 하겠다는 의미라기보다는 ‘납득 가능한 것’에 돈을 내겠다는 의미에 가까운 것 같습니다. 그래서 장례에 필요한 품목들이나 절차에 대해서 충분히 설명을 드리게 되고요. 저는 좋은 흐름이라고 생각해요. 경황없고 일생에 한두 번밖에 없는 일이기 때문에 그냥 넘어갈 수도 있지만, 사실은 반대로 그럴수록 더 꼼꼼하게 따져서 진행해야죠.\n그리고 가족장, 무빈소장이 진행된다는 건 조문객이 없거나 극히 소수인 장례가 많아진다는 뜻이기도 해요. 그러면 자연스럽게 장례 일정 중에 시간이 많이 비게 되는데, 이 시간을 어떻게 쓸지도 중요한 고민이 되어가고 있어요. 예전처럼 손님 접대에 집중하는 게 아니라면, 오히려 고인을 돌아보는 콘텐츠나 가족 간의 대화, 묵상 같은 시간이 장례의 본질을 더 잘 드러낼 수도 있거든요. 아직 자리 잡지는 못했지만, 점차 이런 흐름으로 변화할 것이라고 보고 있습니다.\nQ. 현장에서 다양한 장례를 겪으셨을 텐데요. ‘이 장례는 참 좋았다’라고 느꼈던 순간이 있었을까요? 대표님이 생각하는 ‘좋은 죽음’과 가장 가까웠던 경험담을 듣고 싶습니다.\n2년 전에 저희에게 조금 특별한 장례식을 의뢰했던 분이 계셨어요. 고객의 이야기를 자세히 말씀드리기 어렵지만 장례식장이 살아생전의 이야기로 가득했었습니다. ‘남겨진 사람들과의 관계’와 같은 눈에 보이지 않는 것까지 포함해서, 방문한 누구든지 그분이 세상에 남긴 것들을 직접 보고 느낄 수 있게 진행이 되었어요.\n장례 준비단계부터 정말 많은 소통을 했어요. 원하는 장례식의 모습에 대해 사진을 계속 주고 받았어요. 부고장에 들어가는 사진도 전형적인 영정사진이 아니라 차를 마시고 있는 사진이라든가 고인의 세계가 잘 드러나는 사진으로 넣었고요. 장례가 끝난 후에 조문객에게 보내는 감사 메시지로는, 고인이 묻힌 바다를 배경으로 한 사진에 시를 담아 보냈습니다.\n예전이나 지금이나 제가 생각하는 좋은 장례식이란 ‘고인의 삶의 발자국으로 가득하고, 남겨진 사람들이 충분히 애도하고 슬픔을 소화할 수 있는 시간’이라고 생각해요. 결국 ‘고인이 무엇을 남길 것인지, 어떻게 기억되고 싶은지, 반대로 남겨진 사람은 고인을 어떻게 기억할 것인지’가 장례와 추모의 의미잖아요. 이 장례식을 준비하고 진행하면서 ‘내 생각이 틀리지 않았구나’ 하고 생각했었죠.\nQ. 가족, 혹은 더 나아가 나의 ‘좋은 죽음’을 준비하기 위해 지금부터 할 수 있는 일들은 무엇이 있을까요?\n‘좋은 죽음’은 죽음 그 자체에서 나오지 않는다고 생각합니다. 좋은 삶, 후회 없는 삶 위에서 좋은 죽음이 나오는 것이라고 생각해요. 자기에 대한 이해, 감정의 정리, 의미 있는 시간의 축적, 삶 전체를 긍정하고 수용하는 것들이 충족될 때 비로소 죽음 앞에서 평온할 수 있다고 믿습니다.\n또 남겨질 사람들에게 어떤 이별을 남기는가도 ‘좋은 죽음’의 핵심인데, 이는 살면서 쌓아온 관계에 의해 결정되는 것 같아요. 그렇기 때문에 자기 자신과 사랑하는 사람들에게 의미 있는 시간이 되도록 소중히 일상을 살아내는 것이 가장 중요한 것 같습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nInterview·Edit 이지영 Graphic

LTV, DTI, DSR. 이 세 용어만 제대로 알아둔다면 내가 얼마나 대출을 받을 수 있을지 대략 감이 잡혀요. 생각보다 복잡하지 않으니, 지금 한 번만 제대로 읽어두면 두고두고 도움이 될 거예요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}대출 필수 용어\nLTV: 집값의 몇 %까지 빌릴 수 있을까?\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}LTV는 ‘Loan To Value ratio’의 약자로, ‘주택담보대출비율’이라고 해요. 집값 대비 얼마까지 대출을 받을 수 있는지 나타내는 비율이죠. 예를 들어 5억 원짜리 집을 담보로 4억 원을 대출받았다면, LTV는 80%가 되는 거예요.\n한국에서는 정부가 LTV 상한선을 정해두고 있어서, 정해진 기준을 넘겨서 대출을 받을 수는 없어요. 이 기준은 한국뿐 아니라 미국이나 일본을 비롯한 여러 나라에서 대출 심사 시 활용되고 있어요. 특히 2008년 글로벌 금융위기 이후에는 LTV가 무리한 대출을 막는 금융 안전장치로 더 중요해졌죠.\nDTI: 내 소득으로 얼마나 빌릴 수 있을까?\nDTI는 ‘Debt To Income ratio’, 우리말로는 총부채상환비율이에요. 내 연소득 중에서 빚을 갚는 데 얼마나 쓰는지를 따지는 기준이에요. 여기서 말하는 ‘빚’은 대출 종류에 따라 계산 방식이 달라요. 주택담보대출은 원금과 이자를 모두 포함하지만, 신용대출, 마이너스통장, 자동차 할부 등은 원금은 제외하고 이자만 포함돼요.\n예를 들어 연소득이 5천만 원인 사람이 주담대 원리금으로 1,500만 원, 다른 대출 이자로 500만 원을 갚고 있다면 DTI는 40%가 되는 거예요. DTI가 높다는 건 소득에 비해 빚 부담이 크다는 뜻이고, 금융기관은 대출 심사를 더 신중하게 진행해요.\nDSR: 내가 가진 빚을 다 합쳐도 감당할 수 있을까?\nDSR은 ‘Debt Service Ratio’, 즉 총부채원리금상환비율이에요. 지금까지 받은 모든 대출의 원리금 전체가 연소득에서 얼마나 부담되는지를 계산해요. 주담대는 물론이고 신용대출, 마이너스통장, 자동차 할부, 카드론 등 모든 대출의 원리금을 전부 포함하는 거죠.\nDSR은 모든 대출의 원리금을 포함해서 계산하기 때문에 대출이 여러 건이거나 마이너스통장처럼 한도형 대출이 있으면 대출 한도가 더 줄어들 수 있어요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n.css-120saye{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;}DTI와 DSR, 뭐가 다른 거죠?\n\n둘 다 ‘내 소득으로 빚을 얼마나 감당할 수 있는지’를 따지는 기준이에요. 하지만 계산하는 방식이 달라요. DTI는 주담대 원리금 + 다른 대출의 이자만 계산하고, DSR은 모든 대출의 원리금을 전부 계산해요. 그래서 DSR이 더 엄격하고, 실제 대출 한도도 더 줄어들 수 있어요. 특히 요즘처럼 심사가 까다로운 시기엔 DSR이 더 중요하게 작용하죠.\n\n이제는 스트레스 DSR도\n같이 챙겨봐야 해요\nDSR 비율을 계산할 때는 한 가지 변수가 더 있어요. 단순히 현재 금리만으로 계산하지 않고, 앞으로 금리가 오를 가능성까지 감안해 일부러 더 높은 금리를 적용하기도 하거든요. 이걸 ‘스트레스 DSR’이라고 불러요. 말 그대로 ‘금리가 오르면 이 정도까지는 갚을 수 있어야 한다’는 기준이에요. 이렇게 보수적으로 계산하면, 금리 인상으로 상환 부담이 커져도 대출자가 감당할 수 있는 범위 안에서만 돈을 빌릴 수 있게 돼요.\n스트레스 DSR은 금융시장 충격을 줄이기 위해 2024년부터 단계적으로 도입됐고, 2025년 7월부터는 마지막 단계인 3단계가 시행됐어요. \n다만 서울·경기·인천을 제외한 지역은 2025년까지 적용이 유예되어 기존 방식이 유지되고 있어요. 그래서 지금은 수도권은 기존 금리에 1.5%p, 지방은 0.75%p를 더해 대출 한도를 계산해요. 실제 금리가 4%라면, 수도권은 5.5%, 지방은 4.75%로 계산되는 거예요.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n신용대출도\nDSR 규제를 받아요\n신용대출도 DSR 규제 대상이에요. 총 대출금이 1억 원을 초과하는 순간부터, 은행권은 DSR 40%, 비은행권*은 50% 규제가 적용돼요. \n예를 들어 연소득이 6,000만 원이라면, 1년간 갚아야 할 모든 대출의 원리금 합계가 2,400만 원(40%)을 넘을 수 없다는 뜻이에요. 이때 포함되는 대출에는 신용대출뿐 아니라 마이너스통장, 자동차 할부, 카드론 등이 모두 포함돼요. 다만 전세대출, 중도금대출, 300만 원 이하의 소액 신용대출은 제외돼요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*비은행권: 저축은행, 카드사, 캐피탈사 등 ‘은행이 아닌 금융기관’을 말해요.\n이때 또 하나 주의할 점은, 2025년 7월부터 적용된 스트레스 DSR 3단계 기준에 따라 신용대출이 1억 원을 초과하면 적용 금리에 1.5%포인트가 더해진다는 거예요. 이렇게 더 높은 금리로 심사되기 때문에, 실제보다 보수적으로 대출 한도가 정해져요.\n주택담보대출 받을 땐\nLTV·DTI·DSR 모두 중요해요\n주택담보대출은 집값을 기준으로 대출 한도가 정해지기 때문에 정부의 규제에 따라 영향을 크게 받아요. 특히 집이 위치한 지역이 규제지역인지 비규제지역인지에 따라 기준이 달라지고, 무주택자인지, 생애최초 구입자인지에 따라서도 조건과 한도가 달라져요.\n6.27 부동산 대책으로 LTV 기준이 바뀌었어요\n2025년 6월 28일부터는 생애최초 주택 구입자도 집이 어디에 있느냐에 따라 받을 수 있는 대출 비율이 달라졌어요. 수도권이나 규제지역에서는 최대 LTV가 70%로 줄었고, 지방과 비규제지역은 기존처럼 80%까지 가능해요.\n수도권에서는 주담대를 받는 경우에 6개월 이내 전입 의무가 생겼고, 이를 지키지 않으면 대출금 회수나 향후 3년간 주택 관련 대출 제한 같은 제재를 받을 수 있어요.\n2주택 이상 보유자의 주택 구매 목적 주담대는 아예 금지됐어요. 예전엔 규제지역 30%, 비규제지역 60% 수준으로 일부 가능했지만, 이제는 대출을 받을 수 없어요.\n이번 6.27 부동산 대책에 대해 더 자세히 알고 싶다면 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}이 아티클을 참고해보세요.\nDTI는 지역에 따라 달라져요\n무주택자나 생애최초 주택 구입자, 그리고 연소득 7,000만 원 이하(맞벌이는 1억 원 이하)인 경우에는 지역에 관계없이 DTI 60%가 적용돼요. \n그 외에는 집이 위치한 지역에 따라 다르게 적용돼요. 투기지역이나 투기과열지구(서울 강남, 서초, 송파, 용산)는 DTI 40%, 조정대상지역은 50%, 나머지 지역은 60%예요.\nDSR은 대출이 1억 원을 넘으면 무조건 적용돼요\nLTV나 DTI는 대상이나 지역에 따라 완화되거나 강화될 수 있지만, DSR은 총대출이 1억 원을 초과하면 전국 어디에서나 은행권은 40%, 비은행권은 50%로 적용돼요. \n특히 2025년 7월부터는 수도권에 스트레스 DSR 3단계가 적용되면서, 실제 금리보다 더 높은 금리를 기준으로 대출 한도를 계산하게 됐어요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 윤자영\n해당 콘텐츠는 2025.07.11. 기준으로 작성되었습니다.\n✽준법감시인 심의완료(2025-394호)",
