        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\nChatbots have evolved far beyond simple question-and-answer tools. With the power of large language models (LLMs), they can understand the context of conversations and generate human-like responses, making them invaluable for customer support applications and other types of virtual assistance. \nLangChain, an open-source framework, streamlines the process of building these conversational chatbots by providing tools for seamless model integration, context management, and prompt engineering.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how LangChain works and how chatbots interact with LLMs. We’ll also guide you step by step through building a context-aware chatbot that delivers accurate, relevant responses using LangChain and GPT-3.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the chatbots in the realm of LLMs?\nChatbots in the field of LLMs are cutting-edge software that simulate human-like conversations with users through text or voice interfaces. These chatbots exploit the advanced capabilities of LLMs, which are neural networks trained on huge amounts of text data which allows them to produce human-like responses to a wide range of input prompts.\nOne among all other matters is that LLM-based chatbots can take a conversation’s context into account when generating a response. This means they can keep coherence across several exchanges and can process complex queries to produce outputs that are in line with the users’ intentions. Additionally, these chatbots assess the emotional tone of a user’s input and adjust their responses to match the user’s sentiments.\nChatbots are highly adaptable and personalized. They learn from how users interact with them thus improving on their responses by adjusting them according to individual preferences and needs. \nWhat is LangChain?\nLangChain is a framework that’s open-source developed for creating apps that use large language models (LLMs). It comes with tools and abstractions to better personalize the information produced from these models while maintaining accuracy and relevance. \nOne common term you can see when you read about LLMs is “prompt chains”. A prompt chain refers to a sequence of prompts or instructions used in the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, with the purpose to guide the AI model through a multi-step process to generate more accurate, detailed, or refined outputs. This method can be employed for various tasks, such as writing, problem-solving, or generating code. \nDevelopers can create new prompt chains using LangChain, which is one of the strongest sides of the framework. They can even modify existing prompt templates without needing to train the model again when using new datasets.\nHow does LangChain work?\nLangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications that utilize language models. It offers a suite of tools that help developers efficiently build and manage applications that involve natural language processing (NLP) and Large Language Models. By defining the steps needed to achieve the desired outcome (this might be a chatbot, task automation, virtual assistant, customer support, and even more), developers can adapt language models flexibly to specific business contexts using LangChain. \nHere’s a high-level overview of how LangChain works.\nModel integration\nLangChain supports various Language models including those from OpenAI, Hugging Face, Cohere, Anyscale, Azure Models, Databricks, Ollama, Llama, GPT4All, Spacy, Pinecone, AWS Bedrock, MistralAI, among others. Developers can easily switch between different models or use multiple models in one application. They can build custom-developed model integration solutions, which allow developers to take advantage of specific capabilities tailored to their specific applications.\nChains\nThe core concept of LangChain is chains, which bring together different AI components for context-aware responses. A chain represents a set of automated actions between a user prompt and the final model output. There are two types of chains provided by LangChain:\nSequential chains: These chains enable the output of a model or function to be used as an input for another one. This is particularly helpful in making multi-step processes that depend on each other.\nParallel chains: It allows for simultaneous running of multiple tasks, with their outputs merged at the end. This makes it perfect for doing tasks that can be divided into subtasks that are completely independent.\nMemory\nLangChain facilitates the storage and retrieval of information across various interactions. This is essential where there is need for persistence of context such as with chat-bots or interactive agents. There are also two types of memory provided:\nShort-term memory – Helps keep track of recent sessions.\nLong-term memory – Allows retention of information from previous sessions enhancing system recall capability on past chats and user preferences.\nTools and utilities\nLangChain provides many tools, but the most used ones are Prompt Engineering, Data Loaders and Evaluators.  When it comes to Prompt Engineering, LangChain contains utilities to develop good prompts, which are very important in getting the best responses from language models.\nIf you want to load up files like csv, pdf or other format, Data Loaders are here to help you to load and pre-process different types of data hence making them usable in model interactions.\nEvaluation is an essential part of working with machine learning models and large language models. That’s why LangChain provides Evaluators – tools used for testing language models and chains so that generated results meet the required criteria, which might include:\nDatasets criteria:\nManually curated examples: Start with high-quality, diverse inputs.\nHistorical logs: Use real user data and feedback.\nSynthetic data: Generate examples based on initial data.\nTypes of evaluations:\nHuman: Manual scoring and feedback.\nHeuristic: Rule-based functions, both reference-free and reference-based.\nLLM-as-judge: LLMs score outputs based on encoded criteria.\nPairwise: Compare two outputs to pick the better one.\nApplication evaluations:\nUnit tests: Quick, heuristic-based checks.\nRegression testing: Measure performance changes over time.\nBack-testing: Re-run production data on new versions.\nOnline evaluation: Evaluate in real-time, often for guardrails and classifications.\nAgents\nLangChain agents are essentially autonomous entities that leverage LLMs to interact with users, perform tasks, and make decisions based on natural language inputs.\nAction-driven agents use language models to decide on optimal actions for predefined tasks. On the other side interactive agents or interactive applications such as chatbots make use of these agents, which also take into account user input and stored memory when responding to queries.\nHow do chatbots work with LLMs?\nLLMs underlying chatbots use Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG), which are made possible through pre-training of models on vast textual data.\nNatural Language Understanding (NLU)\nContext awareness: LLMs can understand the subtlety and allusions in a conversation, and they can keep track of the conversation from one turn to the next. This makes it possible for the chatbots to generate logical and contextually appropriate responses to the clients.\nIntent recognition: These models should be capable of understanding the user’s intent from their queries, whether the language is very specific or quite general. They can discern what the user wants to achieve and determine the best way to help them reach that goal.\nSentiment analysis: Chatbots can determine the emotion of the user through the tone of language used and adapt to the user’s emotional state, which increases the engagement of the user.\nNatural Language Generation (NLG)\nResponse generation: When LLMs are asked questions, the responses they provide are correct both in terms of grammar and the context. This is because the responses that are produced by these models mimic human communication, due to the training of the models on vast amounts of natural language textual data.\nCreativity and flexibility: Apart from simple answers, LLM-based chatbots can tell a story, create a poem, or provide a detailed description of a specific technical issue and, therefore, can be considered to be very flexible in terms of the provided material.\nPersonalization and adaptability\nLearning from interactions: Chatbots make the interaction personalized because they have the ability to learn from the users’ behavior, as well as from their choices. It can be said that it is constantly learning, thereby making the chatbot more effective and precise in answering questions.\nAdaptation to different domains: The LLMs can be tuned to particular areas or specialties that allow the chatbots to perform as subject matter experts in customer relations, technical support, or the healthcare domain.\nLLMs are capable of understanding and generating text in multiple languages, making them suitable for applications in diverse linguistic contexts.\nBuilding your own chatbot with LangChain in five steps\nThis project aims to build a chatbot that leverages GPT-3 to search for answers within documents. First, we scrape content from online articles, split them into small chunks, compute their embeddings, and store them in Deep Lake. Then, we use a user query to retrieve the most relevant chunks from Deep Lake, which are incorporated into a prompt for generating the final answer with the LLM.\nIt’s important to note that using LLMs carries a risk of generating hallucinations or false information. While this may be unacceptable for many customer support scenarios, the chatbot can still be valuable for assisting operators in drafting answers that they can verify before sending to users.\nNext, we’ll explore how to manage conversations with GPT-3 and provide examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of this workflow\nStep 1: Project creation, prerequisites, and required library installation\nFirst create your PyCharm project for the chatbot. Open up Pycharm and click on “new project”. Then give a name of your project.\n\n\n\n\nOnce ready with the project set up, generate your `OPENAI_API_KEY` on the OpenAI API Platform Website, once you are logged in (or sign up on the OpenAI website for that purpose). To do that go to the “API Keys” section on the left navigation menu and then click on the button “+Create new secret key”. Don’t forget to copy your key.\nAfter that get your `ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN` by signing up on the Activeloop website. Once logged in, just click on the button “Create API Token” and you’ll be navigated to the token creation page. Copy this token as well.\nOnce you have both the token and the key, open your configuration settings in PyCharm, by clicking on the 3 dots button next to the run and debug buttons, and choose “Edit”. You should see the following window:\n\n\n\n\nNow locate the field “Environment variables” and find the icon on the right side of the field. Then click there – you’ll see the following window:\n\n\n\n\nAnd now by clicking the + button start adding your environmental variables and be careful with their names. They should be the same as mentioned above: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN`. When ready just click OK on the first window and then “Apply” and “OK” on the second one.\nThat’s a very big advantage of PyCharm and I very much love it, because it handles the environment variables for us automatically without the requirement for additional calls to them, allowing us to think more about the creative part of the code.\nNote: ActiveLoop is a technology company that focuses on developing data infrastructure and tools for machine learning and artificial intelligence. The company aims to streamline the process of managing, storing, and processing large-scale datasets, particularly for deep learning and other AI applications.\nDeepLake is an ActiveLoop’s flagship product. It provides efficient data storage, management, and access capabilities, optimized for large-scale datasets often used in AI.\nInstall the required libraries\nWe’ll use the `SeleniumURLLoader` class from LangChain, which relies on the `unstructured` and `selenium` Python libraries. Install these using pip.  It is recommended to install the latest version, although the code has been specifically tested with version 0.7.7. \nTo do that use the following command in your PyCharm terminal:\npip install unstructured selenium\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to install langchain, deeplake and openai. To do that just use this command in your terminal (same window you used for Selenium) and wait a bit until everything is successfully installed:\npip install langchain==0.0.208 deeplake openai==0.27.8 psutil tiktoken\nTo make sure all libraries are properly installed, just add the following lines needed for our chatbot app and click on the Run button:\nfrom langchain.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbeddings\n\nfrom langchain.vectorstores import DeepLake\n\nfrom langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n\nfrom langchain import OpenAI\n\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import SeleniumURLLoader\n\nfrom langchain import PromptTemplate\nAnother way to install your libraries is through the settings of PyCharm. Open them and go to the section Project -> Project Interpreter. Then locate the + button, search for your package and hit the button “Install Package”. Once ready, close it, and on the next window click “Apply” and then “OK”.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Splitting content into chunks and computing their embeddings\nAs previously mentioned, our chatbot will “communicate” with content coming out of online articles, that’s why I picked Digitaltrends.com as my source of data and selected 8 articles to start. All of them are organized into a Python list and assigned to a variable called “articles”.\narticles = ['https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/claude-sonnet-vs-gpt-4o-comparison/',\n           'https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-intelligence-proves-that-macbooks-need-something-more/',\n           'https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-use-openai-chatgpt-text-generation-chatbot/',\n           'https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/character-ai-how-to-use/',\n           'https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-upload-pdf-to-chatgpt/']\nWe load the documents from the provided URLs and split them into chunks using the `CharacterTextSplitter` with a chunk size of 1000 and no overlap:\n# Use the selenium to load the documents\nloader = SeleniumURLLoader(urls=articles)\ndocs_not_splitted = loader.load()\n\n# Split the documents into smaller chunks\ntext_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)\ndocs = text_splitter.split_documents(docs_not_splitted)\nIf you run the code till now you should receive the following output, if everything works well:\n[Document(page_content=\"techcrunch\\n\\ntechcrunch\\n\\nWe, TechCrunch, are part of the Yahoo family of brandsThe sites and apps that we own and operate, including Yahoo and AOL, and our digital advertising service, Yahoo Advertising.Yahoo family of brands.\\n\\n    When you use our sites and apps, we use \\n\\nCookiesCookies (including similar technologies such as web storage) allow the operators of websites and apps to store and read information from your device. Learn more in our cookie policy.cookies to:\\n\\nprovide our sites and apps to you\\n\\nauthenticate users, apply security measures, and prevent spam and abuse, and\\n\\nmeasure your use of our sites and apps\\n\\n    If you click '\", metadata={'source': ……………]\nNext, we generate the embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings and save them in a DeepLake vector store hosted in the cloud. Ideally, in a production environment, we could upload an entire website or course lesson to a DeepLake dataset, enabling searches across thousands or even millions of documents. \nBy leveraging a serverless Deep Lake dataset in the cloud, applications from various locations can seamlessly access a centralized dataset without the necessity of setting up a vector store on a dedicated machine.\nWhy do we need embeddings and documents in chunks?\nWhen building chatbots with Langchain, embeddings and chunking documents are essential for several reasons that relate to the efficiency, accuracy, and performance of the chatbot.\nEmbeddings are vector representations of text (words, sentences, paragraphs, or documents) that capture semantic meaning. They encapsulate the context and meaning of words in a numerical form. This allows the chatbot to understand and generate responses that are contextually appropriate by capturing nuances, synonyms, and relationships between words.\nThanks to the embeddings, the chatbot can also quickly identify and retrieve the most relevant responses or information from a knowledge base, because they allow matching user queries with the most semantically relevant chunks of information, even if the wording differs.\nChunking, on the other side, involves dividing large documents into smaller, manageable pieces or chunks. Smaller chunks are faster to process and analyze compared to large, monolithic documents. This results in quicker response times from the chatbot.\nDocument chunking helps also with the relevancy of the output, because when a user asks a question, it is often only in a specific part of a document. Chunking allows the system to pinpoint and retrieve just the relevant sections and the chatbot can provide more precise and accurate answers.\nNow let’s get back to our application and let’s update the following code by including your Activeloop organization ID. Keep in mind that, by default, your organization ID is the same as your username.\n# TODO: use your organization id here. (by default, org id is your username)\nmy_activeloop_org_id = \"didogrigorov\"\nmy_activeloop_dataset_name = \"jetbrains_article_dataset\"\ndataset_path = f\"hub://{my_activeloop_org_id}/{my_activeloop_dataset_name}\"\ndb = DeepLake(dataset_path=dataset_path, embedding_function=embeddings)\n\n\n# add documents to our Deep Lake dataset\ndb.add_documents(docs)\nAnother great feature of PyCharm I love is the option TODO notes to be added directly in Python comments. Once you type TODO with capital letters, all notes go to a section of PyCharm where you can see them all:\n# TODO: use your organization id here. (by default, org id is your username)\nYou can click on them and PyCharm directly shows you where they are in your code. I find it very convenient for developers and use it all the time:\n\n\n\n\nIf you execute the code till now you should see the following output, if everything works normal:\n\n\n\n\nTo find the most similar chunks to a given query, we can utilize the similarity_search method provided by the Deep Lake vector store:\n# Check the top relevant documents to a specific query\nquery = \"how to check disk usage in linux?\"\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\nprint(docs[0].page_content)\nStep 3: Let’s build the prompt for GPT-3\nWe will design a prompt template that integrates role-prompting, pertinent Knowledge Base data, and the user’s inquiry. This template establishes the chatbot’s persona as an outstanding customer support agent. It accepts two input variables: chunks_formatted, containing the pre-formatted excerpts from articles, and query, representing the customer’s question. The goal is to produce a precise response solely based on the given chunks, avoiding any fabricated or incorrect information.\nStep 4: Building the chatbot functionality\nTo generate a response, we begin by retrieving the top-k (e.g., top-3) chunks that are most similar to the user’s query. These chunks are then formatted into a prompt, which is sent to the GPT-3 model with a temperature setting of 0.\n# user question\nquery = \"How to check disk usage in linux?\"\n\n# retrieve relevant chunks\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\nretrieved_chunks = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]\n\n# format the prompt\nchunks_formatted = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunks)\nprompt_formatted = prompt.format(chunks_formatted=chunks_formatted, query=query)\n\n# generate answer\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0)\nanswer = llm(prompt_formatted)\nprint(answer)\nIf everything works fine, your output should be:\nTo upload a PDF to ChatGPT, first log into the website and click the paperclip icon next to the text input field. Then, select the PDF from your local hard drive, Google Drive, or Microsoft OneDrive. Once attached, type your query or question into the prompt field and click the upload button. Give the system time to analyze the PDF and provide you with a response.\nStep 5: Build conversational history\n# Create conversational memory\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\", input_key=\"input\")\n\n# Define a prompt template that includes memory\ntemplate = \"\"\"You are an exceptional customer support chatbot that gently answers questions.\n\n{chat_history}\n\nYou know the following context information.\n\n{chunks_formatted}\n\nAnswer the following question from a customer. Use only information from the previous context information. Do not invent stuff.\n\nQuestion: {input}\n\nAnswer:\"\"\"\n\nprompt = PromptTemplate(\n    input_variables=[\"chat_history\", \"chunks_formatted\", \"input\"],\n    template=template,\n)\n\n# Initialize the OpenAI model\nllm = OpenAI(openai_api_key=\"YOUR API KEY\", model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\", temperature=0)\n\n# Create the LLMChain with memory\nchain = LLMChain(\n    llm=llm,\n    prompt=prompt,\n    memory=memory\n)\n\n# User query\nquery = \"What was the 5th point about on the question how to remove spotify account?\"\n\n# Retrieve relevant chunks\ndocs = db.similarity_search(query)\nretrieved_chunks = [doc.page_content for doc in docs]\n\n# Format the chunks for the prompt\nchunks_formatted = \"\\n\\n\".join(retrieved_chunks)\n\n# Prepare the input for the chain\ninput_data = {\n    \"input\": query,\n    \"chunks_formatted\": chunks_formatted,\n    \"chat_history\": memory.buffer\n}\n\n# Simulate a conversation\nresponse = chain.predict(**input_data)\n\nprint(response)\nLet’s walk through the code in a more conversational manner.\nTo start with, we set up a conversational memory using `ConversationBufferMemory`. This allows our chatbot to remember the ongoing chat history, using `input_key=”input”` to manage the incoming user inputs.\nNext, we design a prompt template. This template is like a script for the chatbot, including sections for chat history, the chunks of information we’ve gathered, and the current user question (input). This structure helps the chatbot know exactly what context it has and what question it needs to answer.\nThen, we move on to initializing our language model chain, or `LLMChain`. Think of this as assembling the components: we take our prompt template, the language model, and the memory we set up earlier, and combine them into a single workflow.\nWhen it’s time to handle a user query, we prepare the input. This involves creating a dictionary that includes the user’s question (`input`) and the relevant information chunks (`chunks_formatted`). This setup ensures that the chatbot has all the details it needs to craft a well-informed response.\nFinally, we generate a response. We call the `chain.predict` method, passing in our prepared input data. The method processes this input through the workflow we’ve built, and out comes the chatbot’s answer, which we then display.\nThis approach allows our chatbot to maintain a smooth, informed conversation, remembering past interactions and providing relevant answers based on the context.\nAnother favorite trick with PyCharm that helped me a lot to build this functionality was the opportunity to put my cursor over a method, to hit the key “CTRL” and click on it.\nIn conclusion\nGPT-3 excels at creating conversational chatbots capable of answering specific questions based on contextual information provided in the prompt. However, ensuring the model generates answers solely based on this context can be challenging, as it often tends to hallucinate (i.e., generate new, potentially false information). The impact of such false information varies depending on the use case.\nIn summary, we developed a context-aware question-answering system using LangChain, following the provided code and strategies. The process included splitting documents into chunks, computing their embeddings, implementing a retriever to find similar chunks, crafting a prompt for GPT-3, and using the GPT-3 model for text generation. This approach showcases the potential of leveraging GPT-3 to create powerful and contextually accurate chatbots while also emphasizing the importance of being vigilant about the risk of generating false information.\nAbout the author\nDido Grigorov\nDido is a seasoned Deep Learning Engineer and Python programmer with an impressive 17 years of experience in the field.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The gaming industry has long been a hotbed of innovation, with developers consistently pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. But as we progress into 2024, it’s clear that game technology’s sphere of influence is expanding far beyond the realm of gaming. \nTechnological advancements coming out of the game industry are quickly adopted by various other industries, from automotive to healthcare to education, as identified by Perforce’s 2024 State of Game Technology.\nIn this blog post, we’ll take a closer look at the report’s key findings and the trends that are shaping the future of game technology. We’ll also highlight some of the findings we found the most interesting. \nYou can download the full report via the link below to get more information on the challenges the game industry is facing, the latest AI trends, the current state of the job market, and predictions for the future of the industry.\nDownload your report copy here\nKey findings and trends\nWidespread adoption across industries sphere\nThe most striking trend in this year’s report is the widespread adoption of game technology across multiple sectors. Traditionally confined to gaming, tools like game engines are now being embraced by industries including media, automotive, and healthcare. \nThe report reveals that 50% of respondents are now using game engines outside of gaming, marking a significant shift in how these tools are perceived and utilized.\nThe main reason behind this trend is the growing complexity of projects. Projects are becoming more complex as the demand for high-quality, immersive experiences grows.\nEconomic uncertainty has added to this challenge, forcing teams to handle changing consumer demands, higher costs, and the pressure to deliver realistic visuals. The report highlights just how difficult it is to manage such large projects, especially with limited resources and teams distributed across different locations.\nCollaboration challenges\nDespite promising technological advancements in technology, collaboration remains a significant hurdle. The report identifies moving large files as the main barrier to effective teamwork, a challenge exacerbated by the growing size of digital assets.\nSource: Perforce 2024 State of Game Technology Report\n\n\n\nWhile issues surrounding remote work have become more manageable, other collaboration issues, such as inefficient communication and feedback loops, continue to impede progress.\nUnsurprisingly, smaller studios and AAA studios face different challenges. Large and AAA studios primarily struggle with collaboration issues and finding time dedicated to innovation. On the other hand, small studios find funding to be their biggest hurdle, far outweighing other concerns.\nSource: Perforce 2024 State of Game Technology Report\nConsolidation of toolsets\nEfficiency is becoming more critical as organizations look to streamline their processes. Instead of adopting a wide array of tools, teams are focusing on consolidating their technology stacks. Game engines are particularly valued for their versatility, with applications ranging from digital twins in manufacturing to immersive educational tools.\nCross-industry trends in game development\nThe cross-industry trends regarding game technology, as highlighted in the report, include several key insights.\nAdoption of game engines \nUnreal Engine is by far the most utilized game engine industry-wide, with 63% of respondents using it. The engine is especially favored in media and entertainment due to its robust tools for creating 3D worlds and its flexibility in various production roles​.\nJust as AAA and indie studios face different challenges, they also prefer using different game engines. Thus, AAA developers often use proprietary game engines but predominantly rely on Unreal Engine, which is nearly twice as popular as Unity. \nIn contrast, indie studios use Unreal Engine and Unity at more similar rates, with Godot gaining popularity as an alternative.\nSource: Perforce 2024 State of Game Technology Report\nUsage of Perforce Helix Core\nThe report revealed that a significant majority of respondents (54%) incorporate Git-based version control tools like GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or Azure DevOps into their workflows. Similarly, over half of the respondents reported using Perforce Helix Core as part of their version control processes.\nOther tools used widely in the industry\nIn addition to game engines and version control systems, game developers continue to rely on other technologies and tools to help them create top-notch experiences for their users.\nIDEs\nAs revealed by the report, the majority of respondents use Microsoft Visual Studio within their development process. However, more than a third of respondents (34% among AAA studios and 46% among indie studios) also reported using JetBrains Rider as their IDE of choice. This could be attributed to Rider’s seamless integration with game engines (Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot).\nCI/CD tools\nThe report revealed a great variety of CI/CD tools used by AAA studios and indie studios alike. Among AAA studios, Jenkins (41%) and TeamCity (23%) stand out as the most widely used CI/CD tools.\nSource: Perforce 2024 State of Game Technology Report\nTeamCity is a powerful CI/CD tool that seamlessly integrates with Unreal Engine, Unity, and Perforce and is widely used by AAA and indie game studios. If you’d like to learn more about TeamCity, feel free to schedule a call with our solutions engineer.\nConclusion\nThe 2024 State of Game Technology Report paints a vivid picture of an industry at a crossroads. As game technology continues to break into new sectors, the challenges of complexity, collaboration, and innovation must be addressed to fully realize its potential. \nThe key for organizations across all industries will be to harness the right tools and strategies to stay competitive in an increasingly dynamic landscape.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In the last couple of years, AI has found its way into virtually all aspects of software development. We know that AI models are getting smarter, and we can clearly see how they have become better at seemingly everything, but why is this happening? One factor that is changing is context size, which is how much information models are able to receive as input. Basically, as the models become capable of processing larger amounts of data, they can provide better outputs.\nIn software engineering specifically, the most recent models have context sizes that allow them to take entire projects – tens or even hundreds of files! – as input, and this impacts a variety of software development tasks. However, with the rapid advancements in the field, the benchmarks are lagging behind. Most researchers still evaluate the newest code models at the scale of files or often even just individual functions. \nBut no more!\nRecently, JetBrains Research introduced Long Code Arena – a set of six benchmarks that require the models to take an entire project as input. All the tasks in the suite contain high-quality reference solutions, manually collected and verified. In this blog post, we will share with you what these benchmarks are and how they will help researchers all over the world to train the next generation of smart AI models for code. If you’d like to learn about Long Code Arena in more detail, check out this preprint of the formal paper, which has received a lot of positive feedback.\nLibrary-based code generation\nCode generation is one of the most common uses of AI for coding. However, one aspect of this use case that can be difficult to control is the exact kind of code the model will generate for you. If you just ask it to complete a task, it might introduce new dependencies that will make your project harder to maintain or it may awkwardly use built-in solutions when more convenient libraries exist. \nOur first benchmark tests a smarter way to approach this scenario. As usual, the model receives a task that it must complete, but it also receives the contents of a given library, and it must complete the task while making heavy use of the library’s APIs. This tests the model’s ability to process a full library – both code and documentation – and provide results that rely on what you want. We found that GPT-4 performs the best, but even it only uses 37% of the APIs found in the reference solutions, leaving huge room for further improvement.\nCI builds repair\nNext up, we test the models on their ability to fix a failing CI build. We give the model an entire repository at the moment of failure and the logs of the failed run, and the model has to generate a patch. For this task, we developed an interactive evaluation system! The patch that the model generates gets applied, and then the fixed version of the build is run live in GitHub Actions. This represents an evaluation pipeline that’s as close to real-world conditions as possible.\n\n\n\n\nThe results show that even the best model – GPT-3.5 in this case – can only fix 17% of failing builds, indicating just how much work yet needs to be done for AI to be practically useful in this context.\nProject-level code completion\nTogether with code generation, code completion is among the most popular uses of AI for coding, and so of course we want to evaluate it. The model receives the full project and the contents of the file, and it then has to generate the next line in this file. The model needs to use the entire project because some of the lines that need to be completed contain functions or classes from other files in the repository. To test this exhaustively, our benchmark includes a detailed categorization of lines by the different functions and classes that they contain, and thus in a way, by difficulty.\nUnsurprisingly, our results show that it is harder for the models to correctly generate a line that contains functions from other parts of the project. However, we tested a way to compose context using files that are closest in the file tree to the completion file, and this resulted in a noticeable improvement. \nCommit message generation\nThe generation of commit messages is an established task in software engineering research, and it is highly useful in practice. Models take in the code diff and outputs a description of it in natural language. While this does not require the full project, existing benchmarks still only evaluate the models on highly filtered, pristine diffs and commit messages, whereas reality can be much more complicated. To test a more complex case, we collected a dataset of large commits, ones with hundreds of lines of code and thousands of symbols. \nAgain, unsurprisingly, the models perform worse on such data than on smaller, more atomic commits. If we want our future models to be able to handle even larger amounts of data, our dataset will come in handy. For instance, we released sources of all repositories appearing in our dataset, allowing future researchers to explore whether the context of the entire project might be beneficial for this task as well.\nBug localization\nBug localization tests the ability of models to understand a repository, with all its nuances and complexities. Given the full repository and an issue that contains a bug description, the model must point out which files need to be fixed to solve the issue. Here, too, GPT-4 performed better than the other models.\nModule summarization\nFinally, the last task evaluates the ability of the model to understand the full project even more explicitly. Summarization is another key way AI models work with code. However, it also is usually tested by writing comments or docstrings for individual functions, while modern models can do so much more. In our benchmark, we give the model a full module or repository and a short instruction about what type of documentation is needed, for example, a README. The model then has to process and summarize it all.\nThis task also features a novel metric. While there are a lot of metrics for comparing texts, they were developed for short strings and might not work on entire pages of documents. For that reason, we employ AI models to evaluate other AI models: We give an LLM the relevant code and two versions of documentation – the reference and the generated one – and ask it to identify which version better matches the input code. We do this several times with the order randomized to account for potential biases.\n\n\n\n\nTesting different models on different context sizes, we can see that GPT-4 beats other models here as well, demonstrating a 45–57% probability of being better than the reference.\nLooking forward\nLong Code Arena represents an important step towards better code models, and it is the first dataset with large contexts in the field. We hope that it will be useful for the research community. We already plan to use it to improve the models in JetBrains tools, and with it we will continue to move the field forward!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Back in the day, computer games were different. Not only have their graphics and mechanics evolved, but they also had one characteristic that doesn’t seem very common in games today: cheat codes.\nCheat codes were sequences of keys that would give you something extraordinary, such as infinite ammo or the ability to walk through walls. The most common and powerful of them was “god mode”, which made you invincible.\n\n\nThis is what your character would look like in Doom when you punched in `IDDQD` – the key combination for god mode. In fact, this particular key sequence was so popular that it became a meme and gained popularity beyond the game itself.\nWhile god mode is not as prevalent in games as it once was, and the era of the IDDQD meme seems to be fading, one might wonder if a contemporary equivalent exists. Personally, I have my own modern take on IDDQD – the debugger. Though it’s not necessarily related to games, it does evoke the same sense of having superpowers.\nSpace Invaders\nHere’s a fun little scenario to illustrate my point. Even if you aren’t familiar with Doom, you’ve probably seen this even older game called Space Invaders. Like Doom, its plot centers around the theme of fighting invaders in space.\nMy friend and colleague Eugene Nizienko has written an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that lets you play this game right in the editor – a great way to spend some time while waiting for indexing to finish.\n\nThere’s no god mode in this game, but if we are very determined, can we add it ourselves? Let’s bring back the classic tradition of hacking programs with a debugger to find out!\nNote: Be responsible! I got Eugene’s consent before tampering with his program. If you’re using the debugger on code that is not yours, make sure to do so ethically. Otherwise, just don’t do it.\nGet the tools ready\nPrepare for a meta experience – we’re going to debug IntelliJ IDEA using its own debugger.\nBut there’s a little problem: when debugging IntelliJ IDEA, we need to suspend it, which will render the IDE unresponsive. Therefore, we need an extra IDE instance that will remain functional and serve as our debugging tool.\nTo manage several IDE instances, I will be using JetBrains Toolbox App. This is an app that organizes your JetBrains IDEs. With it, you can install several versions of the same IDE or create shortcuts for running them with different sets of VM options.\nLet’s install two instances of IntelliJ IDEA:\n\nIf you are using the same IDE version for both instances, make sure to specify different system, config, and logs directories in Tool actions | Settings | Configuration. On this page, you can also assign names to the IDE instances for convenience. I named them ‘Space Invaders’ and ‘Debug’.\nTo be able to debug the Space Invaders instance, click Tool actions near it, then go to Settings | Edit JVM options. In the file that opens, paste the following line:\n-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005\n\nThis will make the target JVM run with the debug agent and listen to incoming debugger connections on port 5005.\nRun the game\nRun the ‘Space Invaders’ instance, install the game, and launch it by running the Space Invaders action. To find the action, hit Shift twice, and start typing `Space Invaders`:\n\nLet’s play for a while and observe the behavior that we want to fix: when enemy missiles hit the spaceship, we lose health from the health bar in the top left corner.\nAttach and suspend\nOur debugging journey begins with opening the ‘Debug’ IDE instance and setting up a new Kotlin project. We need this project primarily because it would not be possible to launch the debugger without one.\nAdditionally, IntelliJ IDEA includes the Java/Kotlin standard library in the new project template, which we might use later. I’ll explain the use of the standard library in the subsequent chapters.\nAfter creating the project, go to the main menu and select Run | Attach to Process. This will show the list of local JVMs listening for debugger attach requests. Select the other running IDE from the list.\n\nWe should see the following message in the console confirming that the debugger has successfully attached to the target VM.\nConnected to the target VM, address: 'localhost:5005', transport: 'socket'\nNow we’re getting to the interesting part: how do we suspend the application?\nTypically, we would set a breakpoint in the application code, but in this case, we lack the sources for both IntelliJ IDEA and the Space Invaders plugin. Not only does this prevent us from setting a breakpoint, but it also complicates our understanding of how the program operates. At first glance, there appears to be nothing to inspect or step through.\nLuckily for us, IntelliJ IDEA has a feature known as Pause Program. It allows you to suspend the program at an arbitrary point in time, without needing to specify the corresponding line of code. You can find it in the debugger toolbar or in the main menu: Run | Debugging Actions | Pause Program.\n\nThe application gets suspended, giving us a starting point for debugging.\nTip: Pause Program is a very powerful technique, which is especially helpful in several advanced scenarios. To learn more, check out the related articles:\nDebug Without Breakpoints\nDebug Unresponsive Apps\nFind the relevant objects\nIf we look at our goal in programming terms, it boils down to preventing the spaceship’s health from going down. Let’s find the object that holds the corresponding state.\nSince we don’t know anything about the plugin code, we can directly inspect the heap using the IntelliJ IDEA debugger’s Memory view:\n\nThis feature gives you information about all objects that are currently alive. Let’s type invaders and see if we can find anything:\n\nApparently, the plugin classes come under the package com.github.nizienko.spaceinvaders. Within this package, there is a class called GameState, which has several live instances. At first glance, this looks like what we need.\nDouble-clicking GameState shows all the instances of this class:\n\nAs it turns out, it’s an enum – which isn’t exactly what we were looking for. Continuing our search, we stumble upon a single instance of Game.\nExpanding the node lets us inspect the instance’s fields:\n\nThe health property appears to be the one of interest here. Among its fields, we find one called _value. In my case, the value is 100, which correlates with the health bar being full when I suspended the game. So, it’s likely the correct field to consider, and its value seems to range from 0 to 100.\nLet’s put this hypothesis to the test. Right-click _value, then select Set Value. Choose a value that is different from your current one. For instance, I’ll choose 50.\n\nAt this step, we bump into an error that reads Cannot evaluate methods after Pause action:\n\nThe problem arises because we used Pause Program instead of breakpoints, and this feature comes with some limitations. However, we can use a little trick to work around this.\nI described it in one of the previous posts covering the Pause Program action. In case you missed it there, here’s what needs to be done: once the application is paused, perform a stepping action, such as Step Into or Step Over. Doing so will enable the use of advanced features like Set Value and Evaluate Expression.\nNow we should be able to set the value for health. Try modifying the value, then resume the application to see if the health bar displays any changes.\nSo we’ve located the object that holds the relevant state. At the very least, we can manually refill the health bar from time to time. We may not be fully out of the woods just yet, but we’re getting there.\nLabels and expressions\nNow that we have identified the object to focus on, it would be handy to mark it. In case you’re unfamiliar with debug labels, this is what a marked object looks like:\n\nLabels can be beneficial in many ways. Within the context of this article, marking the relevant object ensures that we can directly use it in features like Evaluate Expression without being dependent on the current execution context.\nUnfortunately, it’s not possible to directly mark _value, but we can mark the object that encloses it. To do this, right-click health, select Mark Object, and then give it a name.\n\nWe can now test how the label works elsewhere. Open the Evaluate Expression dialog and enter health_object_DebugLabel as the expression. As you can see, the object is accessible from anywhere in the program through the Evaluate dialog:\n\nWhat about changing the spaceship’s health from Evaluate? health_object_DebugLabel._value = 100 does not work.\nAt the same time, _value appears to be a backing field of a Kotlin property. If this is true, Kotlin must have generated a corresponding getter:\nhealth_object_DebugLabel.getValue()\nThe Evaluate dialog doesn’t think this is valid code, but we’ll try it anyway:\n\nThe expression returns the current spaceship’s health, so this approach works! As you would expect, the setter works, too:\nhealth_object_DebugLabel.setValue(100)\nAfter evaluating the setter, let’s resume the application and verify that the changes took effect. Yep – I see a full health bar!\nHook the expression\nThe only remaining step for reaching our goal is to automate the modification of the state so that the health refill happens behind the scenes, letting us enjoy the gameplay without interruptions.\nThis can be done using non-suspending breakpoints. This type of breakpoint is commonly used for logging; however, the logging expression does not necessarily need to be pure. Therefore, we can introduce the desired side effect within the logging expression. But without the source code, it seems as though we don’t have anywhere to set this breakpoint.\nRemember how I said that we might use the sources of the Java/Kotlin standard library? Here’s the idea: IntelliJ IDEA and its plugins are written in Java/Kotlin, and they use Swing as the UI framework. Consequently, Space Invaders is sure to call code from these dependencies. This means that we can use their sources to set breakpoints.\nNote: For the sake of simplicity, we didn’t specify a JDK version. Instead we initialized the project with the version suggested by IntelliJ IDEA. However, for best results, we recommend using sources that closely match the version used to run your program.\nThere are numerous locations suitable for setting a breakpoint. I decided to set a method breakpoint in java.awt.event.KeyListener::keyPressed. This will trigger the side effect every time we press a key:\n\nNote: Setting a breakpoint with an expression in hot code might significantly slow down the target application.\nLet’s return to Space Invaders and see if our home-cooked IDDQD works. It does!\n\nConclusion\nIn this article, we used the debugger to find out how an application works under the hood. Then we were able to navigate through its memory and modify its functionality, all without touching the application’s sources! I hope my comparison of the debugger with IDDQD didn’t come across as too audacious, and that you learned some techniques that will give you a leg up in your debugging challenges.\nI’d like to extend my kudos to Eugene Nizienko for making the Space Invaders plugin and Egor Ushakov for being a constant source of inspiration in debugging and programming. Computers are twice as fun with people like them around.\nIf you have debugging challenges in mind that you want to read about in the upcoming posts, let us know!\nHappy hacking!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "An Important Foundation For Security, Privacy, and Compliance at Airbnb\n\nBy: Sam Kim, Alex Klimov, Woody Zhou, Sylvia Tomiyama, Aniket Arondekar, Ansuman Acharya\nIntroduction\nAirbnb is built on trust. One key way we maintain trust with our community is by ensuring that personal data is handled with care, in a manner that meets security, privacy, and compliance requirements. Understanding where and what personal data exists is foundational to this.\nOver the past several years, we’ve built our own data classification system that adapts to the needs of our data ecosystem, to streamline our processes, and further unlock our ability to protect the data entrusted to Airbnb. This was made possible by many teams working closely to achieve this overarching, shared objective. Information Security, Privacy, Data Governance, Legal, and Engineering collaborated to tackle this problem holistically to produce a unified data identification and classification strategy across all data stores.\nIn this blog, we will shed light on the complexities of how data classification works at Airbnb, what measurements we set to assess the quality, performance, and accuracy of the systems involved, and the important considerations when building a data classification system. We hope to share insights for others that are facing similar challenges and to provide a framework for how data classification systems can be built at scale.\nThe Complexities of Data Classification at Airbnb\nData classification is the process of identifying where data exists and then organizing, detecting, and annotating that data based on a taxonomy. At Airbnb, we have established a Personal Data Taxonomy Council to define the taxonomy for personal data and to refine it over time. This taxonomy breaks down personal data into various data elements that are relevant for our ecosystem such as email address, physical address, and guest names. Once data is annotated with its applicable personal data element(s), various enforcement systems use these annotations to ensure personal data is handled according to our Security and Privacy policies. In this blog post, we will focus primarily on the data classification workflow and not each type of enforcement use case.\nThe workflow can be classified into three pillars:\n\nCatalog: What data do we have?\nDetection: What data do we suspect is personal data?\nReconciliation: Which classification do we choose?\nPersonal Data Classification Flow\nLet’s dig deeper into how each of these form the backbone of data classification.\nCatalog\nCataloging involves building a dynamic, accurate, and scalable system to first identify where data exists and then organize the whole inventory. Cataloging is akin to mapping the data landscape or organizing a library. It involves dynamically discovering new data, enriching it with metadata from various sources, and manually inputting information. This process is crucial for enforcing data policies, accurately classifying data, and assigning it to the correct owners.\n\nAutomated and Dynamic Discovery: Automation makes the cataloging process scalable and efficient. For the variety of data stores that Airbnb uses, such as production and analytical databases, object stores, and cloud storage, our catalogs connect to them and dynamically fetch the full inventory of data. Either through stream or batch processing, they dynamically update to reflect new and changed data. This ensures the catalog is a reliable and accurate source of truth.\nComplexity and Diversity in Data Sources: The challenge of cataloging stems from the variety and complexity of data sources, including different formats and locations. Our cataloging systems fetch metadata in several ways: through direct API calls or by crawling schemas in formats like thrift, JSON, yaml, or config files, accommodating the diverse nature of modern data storage.\n\nFor search and discovery, many of our data entities are surfaced in the data management platform, Metis. This helps the data owners quickly answer questions such as which data contains personal data, who owns the data, and which controls are in place.\nCatalog UI\nDetection\nFor personal data detection, we use the in-house automated detection service in our Data Protection Platform which was built to protect data in compliance with global regulations and security requirements. As our own taxonomy grows, we have expanded our capabilities and made the service easily extensible to detect all other types of personal data elements and personal Airbnb IDs.\nDetection engine\nFor each data entity stored in the catalogs, scanning jobs are scheduled through a message queue, which then samples data and runs through our list of classifiers. Recognizing the need for periodic classifier updates, the detection engine was designed for simplicity and flexibility. Since its inception, our detection engine has upgraded to include additional steps and adopted the approach of configuration-driven development. The majority of the logic of the detection engine has been rewritten as simpler configurations to increase the speed of iterating on existing classifiers, improve testing, and enable quick development of new features.\nThe detection engine can be seen as a pipeline, which involves the scanner, validator, and thresholding.\nDetection Engine\nScanner: The scanner classifies personal data using metadata and content, employing methods like regex for emails and keyword lists for cities, and advanced machine learning models for complex data types requiring contextual understanding.\nValidator: Sampled data matching a scanner undergoes a customizable validation step to enhance classifier accuracy, verifying details like latitude/longitude ranges or custom ciphertexts from encryption services.\nThresholding: To reduce noise, thresholding is applied before storing results, varying by data structure type (e.g., matched rows vs. findings in a document) and set based on historical data frequency and criticality.\nWith the revamped pipeline, this has resulted in a significant decrease in false positive findings and reduced the burden on data owners to verify every result, which has historically impeded their productivity.\nReconciliation\nNot every detection surfaced may be correct or, in other cases, more context may be required. Therefore, we employ a human-in-the-loop strategy: where data owners confirm the classifications. This step is critical in ensuring these classifications are correct before any data policies are automatically enforced to protect our data.\nAutomated Notifications\nFor compliance, we have an automated notification system that issues tickets whenever personal data is detected. These get surfaced to the appropriate data or service owners with strict SLAs.\nFor data entities that have schemas defined in code, such as transactional tables from production services (online), Amazon S3 buckets, or tables that are exported to our data warehouse, we assist the developers by automatically creating code changes that update their table schemas with the detected personal data elements.\nEnforcing resolution\nTo enforce resolution on these tickets, tables are automatically access controlled in the data warehouse when the tickets are not resolved within SLA. Additionally reviews are conducted to ensure our classifications are correct for data where its handling requirements apply.\nTracking actions taken on these tickets for when personal data is detected has been important to assess the quality of our data classification flow and to keep an audit trail of past detections. It also highlights points of friction developers face when resolving these tickets. The investments we have made in this area have continued to improve the process and reduce the time needed to resolve tickets each year.\nAssessing Quality of a Data Classification System\nBecause of the complexity of the system and its sub-components, this presented a unique challenge as we strive to define what quality means for the entire system. To build with the long-term in mind, we evaluated how well our entire data classification system functions as a whole.\nWe’ve set up measurements to assess quality of our data classification in three categories:\nRecall: This measures our coverage and ability to not miss where personal data may exist, crucial for protecting the stored personal data. We assess recall through:\n\nNumber of data entities integrated in the data classification system\nVolume of personal data that exists from all different sources\nTypes of personal data being annotated and automatically detected against our taxonomy\n\nPrecision: This evaluates the accuracy of our data classifications, vital for data owners tagging their data. High precision minimizes tagging friction. Precision is measured by:\n\nTracking false positive rates of classifiers for each type of personal data\nTracking ticket resolutions made by data owners, which also aids in understanding nuanced classification cases\n\nSpeed: This gauges the efficiency of identifying and classifying personal data, aiming to minimize compliance risks. Speed is measured by:\n\nTime it takes for the detection engine for scanning new data entities\nTime it takes for data owners to reconcile classifications and resolve tickets\nThe frequency of data tagging at creation by data owners\n\nThese measurements ensure our data classification system is effective, accurate, and efficient, safeguarding our personal data.\nConsiderations for Building a Data Classification System\nIt is important to be aware of issues that may be present with the outlined approach in general. Below are some challenges that we’ve considered when building a data classification system:\n\nPost-Processing Classification: The outlined approach mostly relies on post-processing classification, which means that schema information is added after data has been collected and stored. In a modern data world where data and metadata are constantly changing, post-processing cannot catch up with data evolution.\nInconsistent Classifications: Data generally flows from online to offline through ETL (extract, transform, and load) processes, and then reverse ETLing back to the online world. However, data classification that is performed independently in both worlds can lead to inconsistent classifications.\nWaste of Process Cost: Duplicate annotations can be made for the same data in the online and offline domains, which might result in increased costs for data classification processes.\n\nTo address these challenges, we describe the process of “shifting left” with data classification and how we started to push developers to annotate their data at the beginning of the data lifecycle.\nShifting Left\nInstead of thinking about governance and data classification as an activity that happens post-hoc, we’ve started to embed the annotation process directly into data schemas as they are being created and updated. This enables us to:\n\nShift Classification from Data to Schema: The schema annotation process takes place earlier in the data lifecycle at the point of data collection. This keeps annotations updated as data evolves and ensures data is annotated before collection and consumption, allowing for immediate policy enforcement.\nShift Classification from Offline to Online: Traditionally done offline, data classification is now integrated into production services, ensuring data is structured and formatted correctly from the start. Leveraging data lineage information enables automated annotation, reducing the need for manual effort and lowering process costs.\nShift from Data Steward to Data Owner: Oftentimes, stewardship, or the responsible management and oversight, of the data is conducted by people who are downstream of data creation, such as data consumers or governance professionals. This change shifts stewardship to the data producers, merging the roles of data steward and data owner. This empowers the team that owns the data to manage it more effectively and scale operations.\n\nSchema Annotation Enforcement\nFocusing on our most crucial online data, we have started executing on shifting left by directly integrating with our internal schema definition language that is known for its annotation capabilities. We now mandate that developers include personal data annotations at the source when creating new data models, providing guidance on accurate tagging. This requirement is enforced through checks that run in our CI/CD pipelines which:\n\nAutomatically suggest data elements: Based on the schema’s metadata, we automatically detect the data elements for all fields defined in the schema with our detection service.\nValidate data elements: Annotations are validated against our own taxonomy and schemas are enforced and all fields are annotated, even when it is not considered personal.\nWarn about downstream impact: We notify data owners when annotations can impact downstream services such as offline data pipelines and direct them to the proper resources for handling.\nSchema Annotation Enforcement\nWhile shifting left has significantly helped to push classifying data earlier and increase coverage of schema annotations, this does not discount the importance of the rest of the classification process. Classifications that happen post-process are necessary for instance in cases where data storages that do not include well-defined schemas. Therefore, continued investments are still needed in detection and reconciliation to cover areas that cannot be shifted left and to verify annotations that may have already been made by owners as a second layer of protection.\nConclusion/Lessons Learned\nThe Airbnb data classification framework has been successful in advancing data management, security, and privacy. Reflecting on the journey, it has offered invaluable insights that have shaped our methodologies. Key takeaways include:\n\nAdopting a unified strategy for classifying online and offline personal data to streamline processes\nImplementing a ‘Shift Left’ approach to engage with data owners early in the development cycle\nAddressing classification uncertainties through clear guidelines and decision-making\nEnhancing education and training initiatives for data owners and consumers\n\nAs the data landscape continues to rapidly change, these lessons will guide future data classification efforts and ensure continued trust and protection of customer data.\nAcknowledgements\nOur data classification strategy has evolved over many years and we’ve been able to quickly adapt and iterate thanks to our decision to build an in-house solution.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 version 17.11 is here and comes with a host of new features for C++ developers. We’ve made improvements across our toolchain, Unreal Engine support, Build Insights, CMake debugger, and more. This post gives a quick overview of what’s available; for all the details, see What’s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.11 on the C++ blog.\nStandard Library\nThe three main areas of improvement in this release are in formatted output, vectorization, and diagnostics. For formatted output, we’ve implemented parts of Formatting Ranges and all of Printing Blank Lines with println. Our vectorization improvements hit over a dozen of the standard algorithms, and we’ve improved the diagnostics of common misuses of std::ranges::to and std::get(std::tuple). See the STL changelog for all the details.\nCMake Debugger\nWe have added support for the CMake debugger in CMake projects targeting Linux via WSL or SSH. The CMake debugger allows you to debug your CMake scripts and CMakeLists.txt files through the Visual Studio debugger.\nTo start a CMake debugging session, set a breakpoint in your CMakeLists.txt file and then navigate to Project > Configure Cache with CMake Debugging.\n\nUnreal Engine Support\nWe’ve added several new features for Unreal Engine developers:\nAn Unreal Engine toolbar that provides quick access to Unreal Engine actions such as attaching to UE processes and accessing the UE log\nAn Add Class dialog for adding common UE class templates to your project\nAn Add Module dialog for adding UE modules to your project\n\nBuild Insights\nIn this update, we added quality of life changes to C++ Build Insights integration. You can now filter your Build Insights trace results by project. For results in each row, you will now see the relative path and file name instead of the full path. We have also improved the grouping of results in the Included Files view.\n\nBreakpoint Performance\nWe have significantly enhanced the performance of conditional breakpoints in C++ through a reworked implementation.\nBeginning with version 17.11, our initial assessment finds that execution time is almost four times as fast, reducing execution time from 80 seconds to 21 seconds over 80,000 iterations.\nSummary\nWe hope this has given you a taste of what’s new. For all the details, see What’s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.11 on the C++ blog.\nWe are very much interested in your feedback. The comments below are open. Feedback can also be shared through Visual Studio Developer Community. You can also reach us on Twitter (@VisualC), or via email at visualcpp@microsoft.com.\nThe post New C++ features in Visual Studio v17.11 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Debugging and diagnostics are vital skills for any developer, but they can also be difficult and time-consuming to get proficient . That’s why we’ve added some fantastic new features and enhancements to Visual Studio 2022 v17.11 that will help you find and resolve bugs faster and easier than ever before. Here are some of the highlights. Download this update and see the release notes for all the details.\n\nDebugging\nBreak on async method exceptions\nDebugging asynchronous code, especially in frameworks like ASP.NET, can be tricky due to the potential for exceptions to be thrown across asynchronous boundaries.\nNow, with Visual Studio Debugger it automatically breaks when an async Task method throws an exception back to framework code.\nAI-generated breakpoint expressions\nAI-generated expressions for conditional breakpoints and tracepoints are now supported in C++. GitHub Copilot analyzes your code and offers insightful breakpoint expressions, streamlining your debugging process.\nDebug AnyCPU applications manifested to run as arm64\nVisual Studio natively supports building and debugging Arm64 apps on Arm-based processors. Unfortunately, applications built with the AnyCPU setting running on an Arm64 machine will default to using x64 emulation. While the capabilities of the x64 emulator have expanded, the most efficient Arm CPU scenarios are supported when applications are running natively.\nTo better support the intended native behavior the Windows 24H2 update introduces a new <supportedArchitectures> setting for your App manifest files. .NET developers can include a list of supported architectures (amd64 or arm64), explicitly signaling that an application built with the AnyCPU setting should run natively using the Arm64 CLR on Arm64 devices.\nBlazor WebAssembly debugging\nThis release features a preview of the improved debugging experience for Blazor WebAssembly apps targeting .NET 9 or later.\nOrganize your breakpoints with default breakpoint groups\nBreakpoint groups allow you to customize and toggle breakpoints for faster and more effective debugging.\nYou can now mark the selected breakpoint group as the default, ensuring all newly added breakpoints are automatically included in that group.\nEdit and visualize LINQ expressions in the IEnumerable visualizer\nThe Visual Studio debugger now offers an editable expression feature in the IEnumerable visualizer, a powerful enhancement for developers working with collections.\nImproved performance of conditional breakpoints in C++\nWe have significantly enhanced the performance of conditional breakpoints in C++ through a reworked implementation.\nOur initial assessment shows a performance improvement of at least 35% in version 17.10 and 70% in version 17.11, reducing execution time from 80 seconds to 21 seconds over 80,000 iterations.\nProfiling\nKeep your target selection in the instrumentation tool between runs\nThe instrumentation tool now persists the target selection between runs offering a significant benefit by enhancing the continuity of profiling sessions.\nWith this improvement, you can maintain your specified target across multiple instrumentation runs, removing the need for repetitive selection tasks.\nDecompile .NET assemblies\nVisual Studio profiler now offers auto-decompilation for .NET libraries in scenarios where source code is unavailable. By automatically decompiling code during source lookup, even without loaded symbols or exact file locations, you can gain insights into the code’s structure and performance issues.\nWith this new feature, while visualizing a collection or dataset, you can directly edit the expressions textbox on the top of the dialog with your desired LINQ expressions. The visualizer updates in real-time, reflecting the data change resulting from your query.\nWe hope you enjoy this update to Visual Studio, and we look forward to hearing what you think. You can share feedback with us via Developer Community, by reporting issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn and on Microsoft Learn.\nThank you for using Visual Studio and happy coding!\nThe post New debugging and diagnostic features appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "개발자라면 필수로 고정폭 글꼴(fixed width font, mono font)을 사용한다. 여기서 mono font란 monospace font를 의미한다. 개발자가 고정폭을 좋아하는 이유는 코드를 볼때 간격이 일정해서 가독성이 좋기 때문이다. 반대로 가변폭 글꼴을 사용하면 탭이나 기호가 들어간 코드를 볼때 매우 불편해진다.\n글꼴은 취향의 영역이라서 어느 것이 최고라고 말할 수는 없다. 다만 여기서는 많이 사용되는 Nerd font를 기준으로 하겠다. 너드 폰트는 다운로드를 자동화하는 스크립트도 있지만, 시스템 전역으로 쓸때는 그냥 수동으로 /usr/share/fonts/ 밑에 디렉터리를 만들고 설치하는게 좋다.\n \n0. 글꼴 선택 기준\n본인은 글꼴을 선택할 때 우선적으로 2가지를 살펴본다. \n첫번째로 숫자 0 (zero)의 안쪽이 빗금인지 점인지를 확인한다. 개인적으로 빗금 스타일을 더 선호한다. 아래 그림을 보면 좌측은 빗금 스타일 0(slashed zero number)을 사용하고, 우측은 점을 찍은 것이다. 어느 스타일을 선호하는지 본인이 여기서 보고 정하면 된다.\nMono font - Slashed zero vs Doted zero\n\n\n두번째로는 폭을 본다. 글꼴의 폭이 넓으면 눈이 덜 피로하지만 한 화면에 많이 표시하지 못한다. 대표적으로 폭이 넓은 형태로는 Roboto가 있고, 좁은 형태로는 Iosevka가 있다. 둘을 비교하기 위해 아래 그림을 보면 된다. 위가 Roboto이고 아래가 Iosevka이다.\nRoboto (top) vs Iosevka (bottom)\n\n\n폭이 좁으면 화면에 많은 글을 표시할 수 있어서 log를 보거나 code를 분석할 때는 용이한 측면이 있다. 다만 문서 자료를 작성할 때는 정신이 사나울 수도 있다.\n \n \n1. Nerd font란?\nNerd font는 개발자들이 주로 사용하는 폰트에 각종 기호(git이나 vim 에디터에서 사용하는 기호)를 추가한 버전이다. 기존 폰트에 기호 이미지를 추가하는 패치된 폰트이므로 어떤 폰트든지 패치해서 만들 수 있다. 다만 패치 스크립트를 직접 사용하면 작업 시간이 좀 오래 걸리는 편이라서 미리 패치된 글꼴을 제공한다. 아래에서 볼 수 있다.\nNerd Font Downloads - https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads\n \n2. 추천하는 폰트\n개인적으로 추천하는 Nerd font는 다음과 같다. \nCodeNewRoman\n넓은 폭을 가진 글꼴이다.\n가독성이 좋아서 터미널용으로 많이 사용된다.\n\n\nD2coding\n네이버에서 제작한 글꼴이다. \n폭이 좁은 편이라 한 화면에 많은 글자를 표시할 수 있다.\n\n\nEnvyCodeR\n좁은 폭과 귀엽게 둥근 글꼴이다.\n\n\nIosevka\n좁은 폭을 가진 글꼴이다.\n자매품으로 Zed가 있다.\n\n\nMononoki\n중간 폭을 가진 글꼴이다.\n동글동글해서 귀여운 글꼴이다.\n\n\nRoboto Mono\n넓은 폭을 가진 글꼴이다.\n\n\nZedMono\n좁은 폭을 가진 글꼴이다.\nIosevka를 약간 둥글게 수정한 글꼴이다. 개인적으로 추천.\n\n\n\n위 글꼴 외에 FiraCode, IBM Plex나 Noto Nerd, Source code pro 도 많이 쓰이므로 한번 위의 Nerd Font 링크에서 확인해보기 바란다.\n그러면 위에서 언급한 글꼴을 순서대로 그림으로 살펴보면 다음과 같다. 참고로 Gnome builder의 설정 화면에서 캡쳐했다.\n \n2.1. CodeNewRoman Nerd Font\nCodeNewRoman\n\n\nCodeNewRoman은 터미널인 gnome-terminal에서 설정해도 좋은 글꼴이다. 아래 그림은 gnome-terminal에 설정한 모습이다.\ngnome-terminal profile\n\n\n \n2.2. D2coding Nerd Font\n\n\nD2coding은 터미널 용으로 써도 좋은 편이다. 그리고 한글이 지원된다는 강점이 있다. 본인은 D2coding 공식 사이트에서 받은 TTC 파일 1개로 버전을 nerdfont 패치 프로그램으로 직접 패치해서 사용하는데, d2coding은 재배포가 가능하므로 나중에 파일 링크를 올리도록 하겠다.\n \n2.3. EnvyCodeR Nerd Font Mono\nEnvyCodeR\n\n\nEnvyCodeR도 좁은 편에 둥글둥글한 스타일인데, 문서 읽을때 오히려 더 좋은 것 같다는 생각이 든다.\n \n2.4. Iosevka Nerd Font Medium\nIosevka\n\n\nIosevka는 기본적으로 가늘어서 가독성을 높이려면 Medium 정도의 레벨을 사용하는 것을 추천한다.\n \n2.5. Mononoki Nerd Font Propo\nMononoki Nerd Font propo\n\n\n동글동글해서 보기 좋은 글꼴이다. 터미널용으로도 괜찮은 글꼴이다. 개인적으로 추천하는 글꼴 중에 하나이다.\n \n2.6. Roboto Nerd Font\nRoboto Nerd Font\n\n\n \n \n2.7. ZedMono Nerd Font Mono Medium\nZedMono Nerd Font Mono Medium\n\n\nZedMono는 Iosevka를 다음은 글꼴이다. 개인적으로 좁은 폰트 중에 제일 좋아하는 폰트이다. 특히 Medium 레벨의 굵기로 표시하면 가독성도 좋다.\n \n \n3. 폰트 설치 방법\n리눅스에서는 개인 홈디렉터리에 폰트를 설치하는 방법과 시스템에 설치하는 방법이 있는데, 되도록이면 시스템에 설치하는 것을 추천한다. 시스템에 폰트를 설치하는 방법은 매우 간단하다. Nerd Font 사이트에서 받은 폰트는 zip 파일로 되어있는데, 이를 풀면 디렉터리가 나온다. 그리고 해당 디렉터리를 통째로 /usr/share/fonts/ 로 복사하면 된다. (복사는 당연히 root 권한으로 작업해야만 한다)\n만일 폰트 파일만 있는 경우, 예를 들어 ttc 파일 1개라면 /usr/share/fonts/ 밑에 적당한 이름의 디렉터리를 만들고 그 안에 넣어주면 된다. 예를 들어 mynerdfont.ttc 파일이라면 /usr/share/fonts/mynerdfont 라고 디렉터리를 만들고 그 안에 파일을 넣어주면 된다. ttf같이 여러개의 파일이 있는 경우라도 방법은 같다.\n보통 글꼴을 /usr/share/fonts 밑에 복사하면 아무 작업을 안해도 자동으로 인식된다. 그렇지만 간혹 인식이 안된 경우도 생길 수 있는데, 그럴 경우에는 font cache를 재설정하기 위해 fc-cache -f 명령을 내리면 된다. 그래도 안된다면 재부팅하도록 하자.\n \n히스토리\n2024-08-20 초고",

Happywhale이라는 사이트는 일반인으로부터 고래 사진을 제출받아 AI로 분석. 이렇게 사진을 올려준 사람들에겐 자신이 올린 사진과 동일 개체의 사진이 올라오면 그 내용을 계속 업데이트 해 줌. 고래가 언제 나타나 어디를 돌아다니며 어떻게 살아가는지 이해할 방법이 늘어난 것.꼬리지느러미를 분석하는데 쓰이는 알고리듬은 한국 개발자 박진모 님이 개발. 전 세계의 고래연구자들이 널리 쓰는 기술.\nHow the World’s Oldest Humpback Whale Has Survived Is a Mystery\n박진모님 인터뷰 blog.estsoft.co.kr/727, 해피웨일 사이트 happywhale.com\n혹등고래 등밖에 못 봤는데 꼬리지느러미라도 보는 게 쉬운 일이 아니었던 듯. 해피웨일 사이트에선 고래에게 위협을 가하지 않도록 적절한 단계를 지키는 여행사를 찾도록 권장. 세계고래연맹(WCA) 회원사를 추천한다고. 한국 인근에서는 오키나와의 혹등고래 관광이 유명한데, 불행히도 오키나와에는 WCA 회원사가 없는 듯.\n\nsanghoon_k6d6 days ago\n튜비(Tubi)라는 무료 스트리밍 서비스가 미국에서 폭발적인 인기. 넷플릭스가 지배하는 이 업계에서 처음엔 “내 컴퓨터에 바이러스가 깔리는 것 아닌가?”, “정말 무료 맞아?” 같은 의심을 들었지만 지금은 당당히 메이저 서비스가 됐음.- 유튜브, 넷플릭스, 아마존, 훌루 다음의 5위 서비스. 디즈니플러스, 애플티비 같은 서비스들이 모두 튜비보다 시청시간이 적음. – 수익성은 아직 물음표. 수익모델은 당연히 광고. – 낮은 비용이 핵심. 저예산 독립영화, 흘러간 옛 영화, 유명배우가 없는 영화 등이 주요 콘텐츠. – 오리지널 콘텐츠도 제작하는데 철저히 소수의 마니아층을 노리는 콘텐츠.점점 스트리밍 서비스들의 값이 올라가면서 조만간 데드크로스(스트리밍 신규가입자보다 해지가입자가 더 많은 상황)가 생길 가능성도 얘기되는 중. 튜비의 성장은 어찌 보면 당연. 생각해보면 왓챠도 10년째 버티며 아니메, 독립영화 등으로 틈새를 잡은 회사. 한국의 튜비가 될 수 있을까 궁금.\nThe Little Streamer That Could\n\nsanghoon_k08/13/2024\n인공지능이 길가메시 서사시의 번역을 돕기 시작. 수천개의 석판에 새겨진 설형문자가 해석되지 않은 상태로 남겨져 있었는데, 이 석판들을 디지털화한 다음 인공지능에게 번역하도록 시켜서 디테일을 빠르게 보강하는 중. 뿐만 아니라 비슷한 지역과 시기의 유물이 새로 발굴됐을 때 빠르게 해당 유물의 내용을 판단하고 다른 작품들과의 연관성을 파악하는데도 도움을 주고 있음.문과생들도 인공지능 정도는 다룰 줄 알아야 문학 공부를 제대로 해볼 수 있는 세상.\nPiecing Together an Ancient Epic Was Slow Work. Until A.I. Got Involved.\n\nsanghoon_k08/12/2024\n뉴욕타임즈가 메달 수 분석을 여러가지로 했는데, 읽다가 재미있는 부분이 있어서 거기만 발췌. 무기를 사용한 시합에서 한국의 성적을 보세요. 양궁과 사격, 펜싱 덕분. 이렇게 쪼개놓고 봐도 미국이 대부분 1등이지만 2020 도쿄올림픽 대비로 봐도 한국이 3위. 1위야 개최국 효과가 있는 프랑스고, 2위는 미국인데, 한국도 전 올림픽 대비 금메달 7개가 많고 전체 매달수도 12개가 많은 나라. 개인적으로도 가깝고 시차도 없었던 도쿄올림픽보다도 중계를 더 많이 봤던 듯.",

GPT-4는 여러 번의 수정에도 불구하고 코드가 제대로 작동하지 않는 반면, Claude는 첫 시도에서 거의 완벽한 결과물을 제공했습니다. 자세한 결과물은 아래 링크에서 확인할 수 있습니다.\n \n[스네이크 게임 비교]\n\n \n고전 스네이크 게임 웹버전, GTP vs CLAUDE 비교 하기\n90년대 MS-DOS 에 탑재된 프로그래밍언어 QUCIK BASIC에서 돌렸던 스네이크 게임을 웹버전으로 구현하였습니다 GPT-4 스네이크 게임 점수: 0 게임 시작 게임종료! 당신의 점수는 CLAUDE 3.5 스네이크 게임\nnowplay.tistory.com\n\n \n \n \n테스트 항목 2: 블로그 기사 생성\n\"AI 시대에 필요한 새로운 윤리강령에 대해 한글 3000자 분량의 블로그 기사를 생성해줘. 제목도 제안해.\"\nClaude 3.5 Sonet의 결과\n\n\n\n작성시간: 43초\n글자수: 3,274자(공백 포함), 2,473자(공백 제외)\n문체: 매우 공식적이고 학술적인 느낌을 주는 문체로 작성되었습니다. 전체적으로 체계적이고 구조화된 문장이 주제를 명확하게 전달합니다.\n어조: 진지하고 설득력 있는 어조를 사용하여 독자에게 신뢰감을 줍니다. 특히 AI 윤리와 관련된 전문 용어를 사용하여 높은 수준의 전문성을 강조합니다.\n전문성: Claude 3.5 Sonet은 AI 윤리의 복잡성을 다루면서 새로운 윤리 원칙을 제안하는 등, 주제에 대한 깊이 있는 분석을 제공합니다. 학술적 연구나 정책 논의에 사용될 수 있는 고급 콘텐츠를 생성했습니다.\n \nGPT-4의 결과\n\n\n\n작성시간: 1분 10초\n글자수: 1,554자(공백 포함), 1,172자(공백 제외) - 요청 글자수 충족안됨\n문체: 다소 서술적이며 탐구적인 성격을 띠고 있습니다. 주제에 대한 설명이 포함되어 있지만, Claude의 결과물만큼 체계적이지는 않습니다.\n어조: 교육적이며 설명적인 어조로 AI 기술의 필요성과 윤리적 고려사항을 전달하려는 의도가 엿보입니다.\n전문성: GPT-4는 AI 기술의 발전과 윤리적 필요성에 대해 설명하지만, 구체적인 제안이나 심층적인 분석은 부족합니다. 이는 비교적 일상적인 블로그 콘텐츠에 적합할 수 있지만, 전문성에서는 Claude에 비해 다소 부족합니다.\n \nGPT-4o의 결과\n\n\n\n작성시간: 29초\n글자수: 2,551자(공백 포함), 1,892자(공백 제외) - 요청 글자수 충족안됨\n문체: 비교적 일상적이고 친근한 문체로 작성되었으며, AI 기술의 실제 적용 사례를 중심으로 설명합니다.\n어조: 대중적이고 이해하기 쉬운 어조를 사용하여 AI 기술의 현실적 영향과 윤리적 고려사항을 설명합니다.\n전문성: 일상적인 예시를 통해 AI 기술의 영향을 설명하는 데 초점을 맞추었으나, 학술적 깊이나 전문성에서는 다소 부족합니다.\n[결과]\n블로그 기사 생성에서 Claude 3.5 Sonet은 GPT-4와 GPT-4o에 비해 훨씬 더 전문적이고 체계적인 결과물을 생성했습니다. GPT-4는 탐구적인 성격을 띠고 있었으며, GPT-4o는 실용적이고 일상적인 접근을 통해 주제를 다뤘습니다. 각 플랫폼의 특성에 따라 다르게 활용될 수 있지만, 전문적이고 심층적인 콘텐츠가 필요할 경우 Claude 3.5 Sonet이 더 적합한 선택이 될 것입니다.\n \n \n종합 평가\n\n\n \n 이번 테스트를 통해 Claude 3.5 Sonet은 웹 버전에서 더욱 강력한 성능을 발휘하며, ChatGPT와 GPT-4o에 비해 사용자가 원하는 결과물을 빠르고 정확하게 제공하는 것으로 나타났습니다.\n \n 특히, 게임 코딩과 블로그 기사 생성에서 Claude의 성능이 두드러졌습니다. AI 애플리케이션의 선택은 사용자 필요에 따라 다를 수 있지만, 이번 비교 결과를 바탕으로 하면 Claude 3.5 Sonet이 일상적인 사용에 더 나은 선택일 수 있습니다.",

Espanso라는 도구인데, 무료고 오픈소스라 많은 분들이 아시면 좋을거에요\n시간 데이터를 다룰 일이 많은데, 서버의 데이터는 UTC로 저장되어 있는 경우가 많아요. 이 때 타임존에 대한 내용을 모를 수 있는데, SQL에서 이 부분을 학습하면 좋겠다고 생각했어요\nBigQuery 활용편\n    \n이 강의는 입문편에서 다루진 않은 부분 중 유용한 함수인 윈도우 함수를 주로 다룹니다\nFirebase 데이터의 특징으로 배열 데이터를 다뤄야 하는데, 배열 데이터를 다루는 방법에 대해서도 학습합니다\n단순히 문법만 배우는 것이 아니라 퍼널 분석, 리텐션 분석을 어떻게 접근하면 좋은지 공유합니다\nPM을 위한 데이터 리터러시 강의랑 연결되는 부분인데, 제품에 대해 생각하고, 그 부분에서 리텐션 개선 아이디어를 생각하도록 강의를 구성했어요. 이렇게 말을 해도 실제로 데이터를 보면 데이터만 보게 되는 경우가 종종 있어서, 강의에서 계속 제품에 대해 고민할 수 있도록 생각을 공유했어요\nGoogle Sheets로 자동화를 할 수 있는 부분이 꽤 있는데, 이 부분도 알아가시면 좋을 것 같다 싶어 이 부분도 추가했어요\n\n\n\n데이터를 활용하고 싶은 분들이 어떻게 학습하면 좋을까\n이 부분은 최근에 쓰레드에 길게 남겼는데, 블로그에도 공유해보아요. 존댓말을 쓰지 않고 자유롭게 남긴 내용입니다\n하드 스킬에 대한 내용은 줄인 버전이고, 머신러닝이나 데이터 시각화 등에 대한 지식은 언제든 해도 괜찮다고 생각\n보통 데이터를 활용한다라고 하면 파이썬, SQL, 통계 같은 기술적인 것부터 생각한다. 그렇기 때문에 이걸 해야 데이터를 활용할 수 있다고 생각\n    \n데이터를 활용한다는 것은 데이터 기반 의사결정을 한다는 것이고, 이것은 문제를 해결하는 과정에서 지표를 정의해서 지표에 따른 의사 결정을 하는 것\n제일 중요한 것은 문제를 정의하고, 문제를 인식하는 것. 대부분 이 부분을 그냥 넘어가지만, 문제 정의를 잘 진행하는 것이 제일 중요하다. 정의가 잘 된다면 지표는 자연스럽게 나오고, 지표는 사용할 수 있는 도구(엑셀, 파이썬, SQL 등 사용 가능한 것)로 추출하면 된다\n논리적 사고는 “로지컬 씽킹” 책을 추천. 맥킨지식 논리적 사고로 유명하고, MECE / So What? Why So를 매번 생각한다\n사실 이 역량은 모든 직무에게 필요하다\n논리적 사고에 대해 어느정도 파악을 했다면, 그 후엔 무엇을 해야할까?\n    \n그 후엔 데이터를 어떤 관점으로 바라볼지에 대해 감을 잡으면 좋다. 신입 시절에 데이터를 어떻게 바라볼지에 대한 관점이 없이 일단 데이터를 뽑고 해석을 하려고 했는데, 데이터를 바라보는 관점이 없어서 어려웠다.\n데이터를 바라보는 과정에선 1) 그래프 기반, 2) 호기심 기반, 3) 상급자 기반 등이 있는데 3가지 방법보단 “목적 기반”으로 보는 것이 핵심. 어떤 목적을 가지고 어떤 지표를 볼지, 그리고 어떤 것을 해야할까?에 대해 생각해보는 것이 필요하다. 목적이 없으면 기준이나 판단이 어렵다.\n이런 관점에 대해 잘 나온 책은 “빅데이터 시대, 성과를 이끌어 내는 데이터 문해력” 이 책이 나왔을 때 처음 읽고 완전 감동받은 책. 논리적 사고랑 연결되는 부분이 있다\n(3) 논리적 사고, 데이터 목적에 대한 학습. 그 후엔?\n    \n앞선 것들을 잘 진행하기 위해, 회사의 비즈니스 모델을 잘 이해하면 좋다. 비즈니스 모델이란 것은 회사에서 매출이 언제 발생하고, 어떤 흐름으로 돈이 돌아다니는지를 의미한다. 데이터 분석을 한다는 것은 목적이 있을텐데, 회사의 서비스를 성장하기 위해 무엇을 해야할까?, 매출을 증가시키기 위해 무엇을 해야할까?, 비용을 줄이기 위해 무엇을 해야할까? 등을 생각한다. 이 때 비즈니스 모델을 이해하면 더 수월하게 생각할 수 있었다.\n관련해서는 “한 장으로 끝내는 비즈니스 모델 100” 책을 추천. 도식화로 정리가 되어있어서 도움이 된다. 그러면서 사용하고 있는 앱이나 서비스의 비즈니스 모델을 분석해보는 것도 추천\n강의를 들은 분들 중 면접을 잘 보고 싶다고 하는 분들에겐 “지원하는 회사의 비즈니스 모델”을 스스로 분석해보고, 도식화해서 그 내용 기반으로 무엇을 할지 생각해보라고 권한다. 이런 것을 하는 사람이 적다.\n(4) 논리적 사고, 데이터 목적, 비즈니스 모델. 그 후엔?\n    \n그 후에 간단한 통계학 공부를 하면 좋은데, 통계학을 어려워하는 사람이 있기에 처음엔 쉽게 접근하는 것을 추천한다.\n  “데이터 분석가의 숫자유감”이란 책이 있는데, 만화로 구성되어 있다. 통계를 활용하는 핵심적인 부분이 나와있어서 이 책을 보면 대략적으로 어떻게 활용해야 할지에 대해 감이 온다.\n그 후에 추천하는 책은 “숫자에 약한 사람들을 위한 통계학 수업”. 이 책도 핵심적인 통계학 개념을 쭉 훑고, 실용적인 관점에서 사례가 많이 나온다. 수학을 극도로 배제해서 눈높이를 낮추어서 많은 분들이 읽을 수 있다.\n그 후에 본격적인 통계를 공부하고 싶다면 “An Introduction to Statistical Learning”를 추천. 줄여서 ISLR라고도 하는데, 많은 분들이 이 책을 기본서 같이 생각한다. 한국어 번역이 있다고 들었지만, 원서를 추천. 구글에 책 제목을 검색하면 원서가 나온다(파이썬 버전도 있음)\n(5) 통계학 그 후엔 무엇을 해야할까, 이 시기엔 상황에 따라 다를듯. 우선 회사에 다니고 계신 분들 대상으로 먼저 이야기\n회사에 다니고 있다면, 어떤 문제를 해결해야 할 것. 진행하고 있는 업무가 문제와 관련되어 있을 것이다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 어떤 것을 해야할까? 어떤 지표를 봐야할까? 생각하기\n    \n이 과정에서 지표 정의에 대해서 알면 좋은데, 지표가 어렵다면 “문제가 해결되면 어떤 모습이 되는가? 그 모습을 숫자로 표시한다면?” 질문을 통해 정의. 요즘은 LLM이 잘 발전되어 있어서 어떤 문제를 해결하고 싶은지를 클로드 등에 물어보면 잘 추천해준다. 그러면 그 지표들을 모두 모아서 어떤 것을 사용할지 결정한다.\n그리고 해당 지표를 개발자나 데이터 분석가분들에게 부탁해서 받아보고, 그것 기반으로 “Action Item”을 생각해본다. 뭘 해야 그 지표를 올릴 수 있을까? 그리고 그것을 실행하고 기능 개발 -> 의사 결정. 바로 문제를 푸는 방법\n(6) 회사에 다니지 않는 취준생이라면\n    \n이런 경우 참 어렵다. 취준생 입장에서 데이터를 어떻게 구할까?라는 고민에 빠진다. 이를 해결하기 위해 캐글이란 플랫폼이 나왔지만, 캐글은 문제 정의가 된 후에 데이터를 제공한 후 모델링에 집중한다.\n데이터를 활용한다는 것은 문제에서 데이터를 해석하고, 의사결정하는 것이라고 볼 수 있다. 그리고 데이터가 쌓인 후 목적에 맞으면 예측 모델링을 진행한다.\n취준생이라면 내가 데이터 분석을 집중하고 싶은지, 모델링을 하고 싶은지 고민해야 한다. 많은 교육 과정에서 모델링 위주로 교육해서 혼란스러운 경우가 있는데, 나눠서 생각해보는 것을 추천.\n어떤 직무를 하던, 이 쯔음에 SQL/파이썬 등을 학습한다. 요즘은 대부분의 책이 잘 나와서 서점에서 고르는 것도 추천\n\n\n\n데이터 분석가 로드맵에 더 추가되면 좋은 것은?\n어떤 내용이 더 필요할까 생각해봤는데, 다음 내용을 추가하면 좋을 것 같다\n데이터 전처리에 대한 학습 : 데이터를 어떻게 처리할지에 대해 방법론이 다양한데 각 방법론의 장단점과 어떻게 활용하면 좋을지에 대해 학습\n설득하기, 협상하기 : 대화를 할 일이 참 많은 직무다. 설득하기, 협상하기는 어떤 직무여도 있으면 좋겠지만 데이터 분석가분들이 더 들어보면 좋겠다. 사내 컨설턴트가 된다는 생각도 같이 하면서\n그 후엔 자신이 자신 있는 도메인 영역을 정해보면 좋겠다. 산업이여도 괜찮고, 비즈니스나 프러덕트 등으로 생각해도 좋다. 하나의 도메인에서 해결할 수 있는 문제를 거시적으로도 파악하고, 미시적으로도 파악해보면 좋겠다\n경영진의 사고 과정 : 경영진에 계신 분들이 어떤 생각을 주로 하고, 어떻게 생각하는지 알아두면 좋다. 이런 생각을 할 수 있게 된다면, 내가 지금 어떤 일을 해야할지를 더 잘 생각할 수 있다. 상황에 따라 유연한 접근이 필요한데, 대표님이 지금 무슨 생각을 할까?라는 생각을 하면서 업무를 하곤 했다\n물론 위에 말한 내용은 일반적인 데이터 분석가 로드맵에서 나오는 내용도 있지만, 아닌 내용도 있다. 회사에서 일을 잘 진행하기 위해 필요했던 내용인데 나만의 경험일 수도 있을 것 같고, 아닐수도 있다\n데이터 사이언티스트가 되고 싶다면, 데이터 분석도 해보고 전략, 데이터 엔지니어링 등을 모두 경험해보는 것을 추천한다. 다만 요즘 데이터 사이언티스트도 회사마다 다르다. 주로 추천 알고리즘을 만들고 데이터 분석을 할 때 데이터 사이언티스트라고 불리는 것 같다\n\n\n\n앞으로 할 것들\n데이터 분석 관련 강의는 잠시 쉬고, 원래 만들고 싶었던 내용을 만들려고 합니다\n어떻게 해야 데이터 엔지니어링을 쉽게 할 수 있을지에 대한 내용. 그리고 데이터 분석가가 이정도는 알면 좋은 개발 지식. 이렇게 선언해두면, 언젠가 하려고 시도할거라 생각해서 선언해두어요\n일단 개발자 블로그 글쓰기 강의는 빠르게 만들 수 있어서, 이것부터 하고 전체적인  강의에 대해 설계할 예정\n강의 만드는 것도 시행착오가 있어서, 여러 방법으로 시도하고 있어요. 이제는 어떻게 해야 속도를 낼 수 있을지 감을 잡아서 계속 시도해볼 예정이에요.\n그 후엔 다시 회사로 돌아가지 않을까 싶어요. 다만 그 사이에 최선을 다해 강의를 만들려고 해요. 회사에 들어가서 온보딩 자료로 활용할 수 있는 수준으로 강의를 만들려고 합니다. 정해진 것은 아무것도 없지만, 일단 이정도로 생각하고 있어요\n최근 데이터 리터러시에 대한 니즈를 많이 느끼고 있어요. 강의 판매도 늘어나고 있고, 기업 강의도 요청받고 있어요. 많은 분들이 데이터를 더 잘 활용하고, 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 계속 하나씩 만들어 볼게요\n    \n회사에서 데이터를 어떻게 활용해야 하는지 가이드를 주고, 더 잘 진행할 수 있도록 돕는 직무도 점점 필요해지는 것 같아요. 단순히 데이터 프러덕트를 만들고 끝이 아니고 여러 조직에 있는 사람들의 상황을 파악하고 해결할 수 있는 방법 도출\n저는 데이터 분석가분들이 점점 데이터 엔지니어링을 할 수 있어야 하고, 데이터 엔지니어도 데이터나 비즈니스에 대한 큰 그림을 이해하면 좋다고 생각해요. 회사 상황에 따라 다를 수도 있지만, 데이터 관련 큰 그림을 잘 이해할 수 있는 사람들이 더 필요한 시기라고 생각해요\n대학생분들을 어떻게 도울 수 있을까 고민하고 있어요. 대학원을 가지 않은 제가 교수를 하긴 어려워서, 지금 진행하고 있는 일들을 집중하려고 해요. 부스트캠프 AI Tech와 유튜브 등. 학생분들이 도움을 구하면 가능하면 최대한 시도해보려고 하고 있어요\n데이터 직무가 아닌 분들이 어떻게 데이터를 잘 활용할 수 있을까? 이 부분에 대해 활용 지침 위주로 내용을 정리해볼까 생각하고 있어요\n\n\n\n마무리\n인프런에 올린 로드맵에 관심이 있다면 한번 봐주셔요. 유튜브 영상도 추가해두었어요\n    \n2주 동안 로드맵 화면에서 쿠폰을 발급 받을 수 있어요. 필요하시다면 활용하셔도 좋을 것 같아요.\n앞으로 제가 어떤 일을 할지, 어떤 커리어를 밟을지 잘 모르지만 지금 상황에 진심을 다해 하나씩 해볼 예정이에요. 지금의 시간이 참 소중하기에.\n제게 궁금한 내용이 있다면 무엇이든 말씀해주셔요. 이 글에 대한 피드백도 좋아요. 제가 답이라는 것은 아니고, 제 생각을 공유했으니 여러 이야기를 나누며 합쳐보고 싶네요.\n\n\n\n\n  \n글 작성하는데 걸린 시간 : 약 40분",

AI에 대해 들어본 적은 있었지만, 실제로 접해본 적은 없어서 스터디를 통해 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering\" target=\"\\_blank\">프롬프트 엔지니어링</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation\" target=\"\\_blank\">RAG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.langchain.com/\" target=\"\\_blank\">랭체인</a> 등의 개념을 배우고 이를 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지에 대한 기초를 익힐 수 있었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>이번 글에서는 저희가 AI를 어떻게 제품에 활용했는지 소개해 드리고자 합니다. RAG를 사용하거나 복잡한 기술을 도입한 것은 아니지만, AI 초보 개발자도 사용자의 편의를 위해 제품에 AI를 효과적으로 활용할 수 있다는 점에서 의미가 있다고 생각합니다.</p>\n\n<p>모쪼록 재미있게 봐주시길 바랍니다.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"도입배경\">도입배경</h1>\n\n<p>키친보드를 사용하기 전, 매장의 점주님들은 유통사로 식자재를 주문할 때 주로 문자나 카카오톡을 이용했습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/kakao-order.png\" alt=\"kakao-order\" /></p>\n\n<p>이 방식에는 여러 가지 불편함이 있습니다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>유통사에서 매장의 주문 내용을 취합하고 정리하기가 어렵습니다.</li>\n  <li>매장에서 과거 주문 내역을 확인하기 어렵습니다.</li>\n  <li>유통사가 다수의 매장 주문을 취합하면서 누락되거나 잘못 정리되는 경우가 많습니다.</li>\n  <li>이로 인해 매장은 주문한 품목을 원하는 시간에 정확히 받지 못할 수 있습니다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>저희 키친보드는 이러한 불편을 해소하기 위해 주문톡 서비스를 운영하고 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>하지만 여전히 일부 매장은 카카오톡으로 유통사에 식자재를 주문하고 있습니다. 유통사는 키친보드의 편리함을 느끼고 이를 적극적으로 사용하지만, 몇몇 매장은 기존의 카카오톡 주문 방식을 고수하고 있는 것입니다.</p>\n\n<p>매장에서는 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">피망 6개, 양파 2망, 올리브오일 2개 주세요</code>와 같이 간단히 주문하는 것이 편리할 수 있습니다. 유통사가 알아서 품목을 해석하고 적절한 제품을 보내주기 때문입니다. 하지만 유통사는 매장의 주문을 해석하고 취합하는 데 많은 시간을 소모하게 됩니다. 더욱이 이러한 지식은 오랜 경험을 바탕으로 작업자들이 처리해 왔기 때문에, 작업자가 바뀌면 배송 실수가 발생할 가능성이 큽니다.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<p>그래서 저희 키친보드는 오래전부터 카카오톡으로 받은 주문을 어떻게 하면 손쉽게 주문톡의 주문서로 변환할 수 있을지 고민해 왔습니다. 주문톡 서비스를 처음 만들 때도 카카오톡 주문을 주문서로 생성하려는 시도도 물론 있었습니다. 일정한 패턴만 정의할 수 있다면 카카오톡 주문을 해석하고, 이를 기반으로 주문서를 생성하는 것이 가능할 것으로 생각했기 때문입니다.</p>\n\n<p>하지만 저희는 아래와 같이 매장에서 주문하는 다양한 패턴에 좌절하고 맙니다.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>피망 6개, 양파 2망, 올리브오일 2개 주세요\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>다진김치1  콩나물2개 깻잎2개 계란5판 청양고추1 깐마늘1 다진마늘1 쌈무4개 날치알3개 떡사리1개 모짜치즈1개 버섯1 만두2개 맛소금1 마요네즈1개\n다진김치는 중국산으로 주세요 3kg\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>맛살-2\n치즈떡-3\n연근-3\n메추리알-3\n고구마떡-2\n비엔나-3봉지\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>콩나물4개 깻잎4개 날치알4개 튀김고구마1개 만두4개 슬라이스치즈1개 오이 3숙주나물 0,5 청양고추1 스위트곤1개 다진마늘1참맛기름1개 설탕1개 계란5 쌈장1개 쌈무6개 당면1개 마요네즈1개 떡사리1개 모짜치즈2개 고추맛기름1 김가루1개 김2개 짜파게티5개입 2 사세바팔로윙스틱1개 미풍1개 물엿1 마카로니1개 감자튀김 1\n레몬 4\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>어떤 매장은 품목명과 개수를 띄어쓰기도 하고, 어떤 매장은 품목명과 개수 사이에 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">-</code>를 넣기도 합니다. 또 어떤 매장은 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">00개</code>라고 표기하거나, 같은 내용의 주문에서도 다른 표기법을 사용하기도 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>결국, 저희는 다양한 주문 패턴을 단순히 조건 처리로 해결하기에는 무리가 있다고 판단했고, 카카오톡 주문을 주문톡으로 자동 변환하는 과제를 이후로 미루기로 했습니다.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ai-활용\">AI 활용</h1>\n\n<p>AI 스터디를 진행하면서 저희는 과거에 좌절했던 카카오톡 주문 해석 문제를 AI로 해결할 수 있다고 생각했습니다.

(다만 유사도 검색에는 원치 않는 품목이 함께 조회될 가능성이 있다는 단점도 존재합니다)</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">깐마늘</code>을 검색했을 때, 아래처럼 다양한 품목들이 조회되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/search-products.png\" alt=\"search-products\" /></p>\n\n<p>그래서 저희는 주문할 품목 선택을 시스템이 자동으로 하기보다는 사용자에게 위임하기로 했습니다. 잘못된 품목으로 주문서가 생성되는 위험보다는 매장에서 원하는 품목을 한 번 더 확인하도록 하는 것이 낫다는 판단에서입니다.</p>\n\n<p>다만, 사용자 편의를 위해 입력한 품목명과 가장 유사한 품목을 자동으로 선택하고, 최근에 주문했던 품목을 우선 선택하도록 하여 최대한 편리하게 주문서를 생성할 수 있도록 했습니다.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"ai-주문서-생성-순서\">AI 주문서 생성 순서</h1>\n\n<p>위에서 말씀드린 내용을 기반으로 사용자가 AI 주문서를 생성하는 순서를 그려보면 아래와 같습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/ai-order-flow.png\" alt=\"ai-order-flow\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"주문서-초안-생성\">주문서 초안 생성</h3>\n\n<p>먼저 사용자는 카카오톡 주문 내용을 복사해서 주문서 초안을 생성합니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/create-draft.png\" alt=\"create-draft\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"주문-품목-선택\">주문 품목 선택</h3>\n\n<p>앞서 “주문서 품목 선택 이슈”에서 말씀드린 바와 같이 주어진 품목명이 원하는 주문서 품목과 일치하는지 정확히 알기 힘들기 때문에 생성된 주문서 초안에서 원하는 품목을 선택합니다. 다만, 가장 많이 주문하는 품목이 먼저 선택되어 있도록 함으로써 사용자가 품목을 선택하는 행위를 최소화하였습니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/select-product.png\" alt=\"select-product\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"주문서-확인-및-주문\">주문서 확인 및 주문</h3>\n\n<p>사용자는 최종적으로 생성될 주문서를 확인하고 주문서를 생성할 수 있습니다. 이때 원치 않는 품목을 제거하거나 추가하여 AI가 생성해 준 품목을 토대로 기대한 주문서를 생성할 수 있게 됩니다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/check-order-sheet.png\" alt=\"check-order-sheet\" /></p>\n\n<h1 id=\"구현\">구현</h1>\n\n<p>이제 기술적인 측면을 살펴보겠습니다. 사실 AI를 활용한 주문서 생성 기능은 기존의 주문서 생성 기능을 크게 변경하지 않았습니다. 앞서 설명해 드린 AI 주문서 생성 순서에서, 초안을 생성하는 부분만 추가되었을 뿐이죠.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/ai-order-flow-for-dev.png\" alt=\"ai-order-flow-for-dev\" /></p>\n\n<p>그래서 주문서 초안을 생성하는 흐름도를 조금 더 자세히 그려보면 아래와 같이 그릴 수 있습니다. 조금 더 자세한 내용은 아래에서 다루어볼게요.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/ai-order-sheet/create-draft-diagram.png\" alt=\"create-draft-diagram\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spring-ai\">Spring AI</h3>\n\n<p>AI 스터디를 진행하면서 읽었던 책은 <a href=\"https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000212568407\" target=\"\\_blank\">랭체인으로 LLM 기반의 AI 서비스 개발하기</a>였습니다. 이 책은 LLM 기반의 AI 서비스를 예제로 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 가이드해 주어, AI 초보자인 저도 손쉽게 학습할 수 있었습니다. (광고 아닙니다!)</p>\n\n<p>처음 학습할 때 랭체인으로 시작했기 때문에, AI 모델에게 주문 내용을 해석해 주는 기능을 별도의 Python 서버로 구현하는 방안을 고민하기도 했습니다. 그러나 팀 정책상, 관리 포인트를 불필요하게 늘리지 않기 위해 키친보드 서비스의 서버에서 최대한 해결하는 것이 좋겠다고 판단했습니다. 그러던 중 발견한 프레임워크가 바로 Spring AI였습니다.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spring.io/projects/spring-ai\" target=\"\\_blank\">Spring AI</a>는 AI 엔지니어링에 특화된 프레임워크로, 랭체인만큼 다양한 기능을 제공하지는 않지만, 저희가 구현하고자 했던 카카오톡 주문 내용을 원하는 형식으로 변환하는 데는 부족함이 없었습니다. 또한, 스프링과 쉽게 통합할 수 있었기에 더할 나위 없는 선택지였습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. 스포카 백엔드팀 프로그래머 남경호입니다.\n최근 ChatGPT를 비롯한 생성형 AI가 주목받으면서 저희 스포카에서도 AI 스터디를 진행했습니다. AI에 대해 들어본 적은 있었지만, 실제로 접해본 적은 없어서 스터디를 통해 프롬프트 엔지니어링, RAG, 랭체인 등의 개념을 배우고 이를 어떻게 활용할 수 있는지에 대한 기초를 익힐 수 있었습니다.\n이번 글에서는 저희가 AI를 어떻게 제품에 활용했는지 소개해 드리고자 합니다. RAG를 사용하거나 복잡한 기술을 도입한 것은 아니지만, AI 초보 개발자도 사용자의 편의를 위해 제품에 AI를 효과적으로 활용할 수 있다는 점에서 의미가 있다고 생각합니다.\n모쪼록 재미있게 봐주시길 바랍니다.\n도입배경\n키친보드를 사용하기 전, 매장의 점주님들은 유통사로 식자재를 주문할 때 주로 문자나 카카오톡을 이용했습니다.\n\n이 방식에는 여러 가지 불편함이 있습니다.\n유통사에서 매장의 주문 내용을 취합하고 정리하기가 어렵습니다.\n매장에서 과거 주문 내역을 확인하기 어렵습니다.\n유통사가 다수의 매장 주문을 취합하면서 누락되거나 잘못 정리되는 경우가 많습니다.\n이로 인해 매장은 주문한 품목을 원하는 시간에 정확히 받지 못할 수 있습니다.\n저희 키친보드는 이러한 불편을 해소하기 위해 주문톡 서비스를 운영하고 있습니다.\n\n하지만 여전히 일부 매장은 카카오톡으로 유통사에 식자재를 주문하고 있습니다. 유통사는 키친보드의 편리함을 느끼고 이를 적극적으로 사용하지만, 몇몇 매장은 기존의 카카오톡 주문 방식을 고수하고 있는 것입니다.\n매장에서는 피망 6개, 양파 2망, 올리브오일 2개 주세요와 같이 간단히 주문하는 것이 편리할 수 있습니다. 유통사가 알아서 품목을 해석하고 적절한 제품을 보내주기 때문입니다. 하지만 유통사는 매장의 주문을 해석하고 취합하는 데 많은 시간을 소모하게 됩니다. 더욱이 이러한 지식은 오랜 경험을 바탕으로 작업자들이 처리해 왔기 때문에, 작업자가 바뀌면 배송 실수가 발생할 가능성이 큽니다.\n\n그래서 저희 키친보드는 오래전부터 카카오톡으로 받은 주문을 어떻게 하면 손쉽게 주문톡의 주문서로 변환할 수 있을지 고민해 왔습니다. 주문톡 서비스를 처음 만들 때도 카카오톡 주문을 주문서로 생성하려는 시도도 물론 있었습니다. 일정한 패턴만 정의할 수 있다면 카카오톡 주문을 해석하고, 이를 기반으로 주문서를 생성하는 것이 가능할 것으로 생각했기 때문입니다.\n하지만 저희는 아래와 같이 매장에서 주문하는 다양한 패턴에 좌절하고 맙니다.\n\n피망 6개, 양파 2망, 올리브오일 2개 주세요\n\n\n\n다진김치1  콩나물2개 깻잎2개 계란5판 청양고추1 깐마늘1 다진마늘1 쌈무4개 날치알3개 떡사리1개 모짜치즈1개 버섯1 만두2개 맛소금1 마요네즈1개\n다진김치는 중국산으로 주세요 3kg\n\n\n\n맛살-2\n치즈떡-3\n연근-3\n메추리알-3\n고구마떡-2\n비엔나-3봉지\n\n\n\n콩나물4개 깻잎4개 날치알4개 튀김고구마1개 만두4개 슬라이스치즈1개 오이 3숙주나물 0,5 청양고추1 스위트곤1개 다진마늘1참맛기름1개 설탕1개 계란5 쌈장1개 쌈무6개 당면1개 마요네즈1개 떡사리1개 모짜치즈2개 고추맛기름1 김가루1개 김2개 짜파게티5개입 2 사세바팔로윙스틱1개 미풍1개 물엿1 마카로니1개 감자튀김 1\n레몬 4\n\n\n어떤 매장은 품목명과 개수를 띄어쓰기도 하고, 어떤 매장은 품목명과 개수 사이에 -를 넣기도 합니다. 또 어떤 매장은 00개라고 표기하거나, 같은 내용의 주문에서도 다른 표기법을 사용하기도 합니다.\n결국, 저희는 다양한 주문 패턴을 단순히 조건 처리로 해결하기에는 무리가 있다고 판단했고, 카카오톡 주문을 주문톡으로 자동 변환하는 과제를 이후로 미루기로 했습니다.\nAI 활용\nAI 스터디를 진행하면서 저희는 과거에 좌절했던 카카오톡 주문 해석 문제를 AI로 해결할 수 있다고 생각했습니다. AI를 활용하면 다양한 패턴의 문자 내용을 우리가 원하는 포맷으로 변환할 수 있고, 이를 바탕으로 주문서를 생성할 수 있을 것으로 생각했기 때문입니다.\n그래서 저희는 아래와 같이 몇 가지 사례를 기반으로 테스트를 진행했습니다.\n사례1\nPrompt\n    \n\nConvert the given 'text' into JSON format with 'name' and 'count' as keys.

(다만 유사도 검색에는 원치 않는 품목이 함께 조회될 가능성이 있다는 단점도 존재합니다)\n예를 들어 깐마늘을 검색했을 때, 아래처럼 다양한 품목들이 조회되는 것을 볼 수 있습니다.\n\n그래서 저희는 주문할 품목 선택을 시스템이 자동으로 하기보다는 사용자에게 위임하기로 했습니다. 잘못된 품목으로 주문서가 생성되는 위험보다는 매장에서 원하는 품목을 한 번 더 확인하도록 하는 것이 낫다는 판단에서입니다.\n다만, 사용자 편의를 위해 입력한 품목명과 가장 유사한 품목을 자동으로 선택하고, 최근에 주문했던 품목을 우선 선택하도록 하여 최대한 편리하게 주문서를 생성할 수 있도록 했습니다.\nAI 주문서 생성 순서\n위에서 말씀드린 내용을 기반으로 사용자가 AI 주문서를 생성하는 순서를 그려보면 아래와 같습니다.\n\n주문서 초안 생성\n먼저 사용자는 카카오톡 주문 내용을 복사해서 주문서 초안을 생성합니다.\n\n주문 품목 선택\n앞서 “주문서 품목 선택 이슈”에서 말씀드린 바와 같이 주어진 품목명이 원하는 주문서 품목과 일치하는지 정확히 알기 힘들기 때문에 생성된 주문서 초안에서 원하는 품목을 선택합니다. 다만, 가장 많이 주문하는 품목이 먼저 선택되어 있도록 함으로써 사용자가 품목을 선택하는 행위를 최소화하였습니다.\n\n주문서 확인 및 주문\n사용자는 최종적으로 생성될 주문서를 확인하고 주문서를 생성할 수 있습니다. 이때 원치 않는 품목을 제거하거나 추가하여 AI가 생성해 준 품목을 토대로 기대한 주문서를 생성할 수 있게 됩니다.\n\n구현\n이제 기술적인 측면을 살펴보겠습니다. 사실 AI를 활용한 주문서 생성 기능은 기존의 주문서 생성 기능을 크게 변경하지 않았습니다. 앞서 설명해 드린 AI 주문서 생성 순서에서, 초안을 생성하는 부분만 추가되었을 뿐이죠.\n\n그래서 주문서 초안을 생성하는 흐름도를 조금 더 자세히 그려보면 아래와 같이 그릴 수 있습니다. 조금 더 자세한 내용은 아래에서 다루어볼게요.\n\nSpring AI\nAI 스터디를 진행하면서 읽었던 책은 랭체인으로 LLM 기반의 AI 서비스 개발하기였습니다. 이 책은 LLM 기반의 AI 서비스를 예제로 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 가이드해 주어, AI 초보자인 저도 손쉽게 학습할 수 있었습니다. (광고 아닙니다!)\n처음 학습할 때 랭체인으로 시작했기 때문에, AI 모델에게 주문 내용을 해석해 주는 기능을 별도의 Python 서버로 구현하는 방안을 고민하기도 했습니다. 그러나 팀 정책상, 관리 포인트를 불필요하게 늘리지 않기 위해 키친보드 서비스의 서버에서 최대한 해결하는 것이 좋겠다고 판단했습니다. 그러던 중 발견한 프레임워크가 바로 Spring AI였습니다.\nSpring AI는 AI 엔지니어링에 특화된 프레임워크로, 랭체인만큼 다양한 기능을 제공하지는 않지만, 저희가 구현하고자 했던 카카오톡 주문 내용을 원하는 형식으로 변환하는 데는 부족함이 없었습니다. 또한, 스프링과 쉽게 통합할 수 있었기에 더할 나위 없는 선택지였습니다. (자세한 사용법은 공식 문서를 참고해 주세요!)\n주문서 초안 생성 로직\n추문서 초안 생성을 위한 로직을 보면 아래와 같습니다.\n\n주문 내용을 해석해 줄 MessageInterpreter가 AI 서비스에 해석요청을 보내고 그 결과를 바탕으로 유통사의 품목을 조회해 초안을 생성해 준다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\n저희는 MessageInterpreter의 구현 클래스에서 Spring AI를 활용하였습니다. 구현 클래스인 AIMessageInterpreter를 보면 상당히 단순한 것을 볼 수 있습니다. Spring AI는 ChatClient를 통해 AI 서비스와의 Prompt 통신을 단순화한 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 또한, responseEntity 함수와 같이 응답 결과를 원하는 데이터 구조로 손쉽게 변환할 수 있도록 해주기 때문에 AI 채팅의 결과를 원하는 데이터 객체로 변환하기 위한 복잡하고 번거로운 코드를 작성하지 않아도 된다는 장점도 있습니다.\nJava가 아닌 Kotlin으로 Spring AI를 사용하시는 분들께 드리는 한가지 팁은 responseEntity의 반환 타입인 OrderProduct를 정의할 때 @JvmRecord를 선언해 주지 않으면 오류가 발생하니 이 부분은 기억해 두시면 좋겠습니다.\n\ninterface MessageInterpreter {\n    fun interpretOrderMessage(message: String): List<OrderProduct>\n}\n\n@Component\nclass AIMessageInterpreter(\n    private val openAiChatClient: ChatClient,\n    private val aiChatHistoryRepository: AIChatHistoryRepository,\n) : MessageInterpreter {\n    override fun interpretOrderMessage(message: String): List<OrderProduct> {\n        val promptMessage =\n            \"\"\"\n            |Convert the given 'text' into JSON format with 'name' and 'count' as keys. Where 'name' is of type String and 'count' is of type integer.\n\n            |text:\n            |$message\n            \"\"\".trimMargin()\n\n        val response =\n            openAiChatClient\n                .prompt()\n                .user(promptMessage)\n                .call()\n                .responseEntity(parameterizedTypeRef<List<OrderProduct>>())\n\n        saveHistory(message, response)\n\n        return response.entity\n    }\n    \n    // 생략...\n}\n\n@JvmRecord\ndata class OrderProduct(\n    val name: String,\n    val count: Float,\n)\n\n\n주문 품목 병렬 조회\n위에서 보여드린 예시처럼, 매장에서는 한 번에 여러 품목을 주문하는 경우가 많습니다. 예를 들어, 주문서 품목을 조회하는 데 1초가 걸린다고 가정하면, 30개의 품목을 조회하는 로직을 아래와 같이 구현했을 때, 주문서 초안을 생성하는 데 최소 30초가 소요될 것입니다.\n\nfun getOrderSheetDraftProducts(data: OrderSheetDraftProductsSearchData): List<OrderSheetDraftProduct> {\n    val orderProducts = aiMessageInterpreter.interpretOrderMessage(data.text)\n\n    return orderProducts.map {\n        val products = searchOrderableProducts(data, it.name)\n\n        OrderSheetDraftProduct(\n            name = it.name,\n            count = it.count,\n            foundProducts = products,\n        )\n    }\n}\n\n\n당연한 이야기겠지만, 주문서 초안을 생성하는 데 시간이 오래 걸리면 사용자는 불편함을 느껴 AI 주문서 기능을 더 이상 적극적으로 사용하지 않게 될 수 있습니다. 이를 방지하기 위해 저희는 병렬 처리 방식을 도입하여 주문서를 조회하고 초안을 생성함으로써, 최대한 짧은 시간 안에 사용자의 요청을 처리할 수 있도록 했습니다.\n아래와 같이 코드를 작성하면 다수의 품목을 조회하더라도 약 1초 만에 전체 품목의 조회 결과를 반환할 수 있습니다.\n\nfun getOrderSheetDraftProducts(data: OrderSheetDraftProductsSearchData): List<OrderSheetDraftProduct> =\n    runBlocking {\n        val orderProducts = aiMessageInterpreter.interpretOrderMessage(data.text)\n\n        orderProducts.map {\n            async {\n                val products = searchOrderableProducts(data, it.name)\n\n                OrderSheetDraftProduct(\n                    name = it.name,\n                    count = it.count,\n                    foundProducts = products,\n                )\n            }\n        }.awaitAll()\n    }\n\n\n마무리\n지금까지 Spring AI를 활용하여 카카오톡 주문을 키친보드 주문서로 자동 생성하는 기능을 구현한 사례를 소개해 드렸습니다. 비록 이번 구현이 단순한 수준이어서 AI 도입 사례로 소개하기에 다소 민망할 수 있지만, 이 과정에서 저희가 가진 문제를 어떻게 해결할지 고민한 점과, AI 도입이 생각만큼 복잡하거나 어려운 일이 아니라는 점을 봐주시면 좋겠습니다.\n최근 OpenAI에서 GPT-4o-mini 모델이 출시되어, 저희가 구현한 것처럼 경량 모델이 필요한 경우에는 GPT-3.5 Turbo 모델보다 비용 효율적이고 다양한 기능을 사용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 그래서 앞으로 이미지 기반 주문서 생성 기능도 도입할 계획입니다. 이를 통해, 유통사에서 화이트보드나 손 글씨로 작성해 카카오톡으로 보내던 주문 요청을 키친보드로 쉽게 전환할 수 있도록 할 예정입니다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 TechCrunch에서 배양육 산업 관련 기사를 읽었다. 우리도 국내 최초의 배양육 스타트업 셀미트에 투자했기 때문에, 관심을 갖고 기사를 정독했다. 기사의 제목은 “Even after $1.6B in VC money, the lab-grown meat industry is facing ‘massive’ issues” 였고, 내용은 암울했다.\n내용을 요약하자면, 너도나도 대체 단백질과 배양육 시장에 투자하기 바쁠 땐, 거의 묻지마 투자 수준으로 많은 돈이 이 시장에 투입됐지만, 연구개발에 생각보다 많은 돈과 시간이 필요하고, 이후에 관계 정부 부서의 승인 받는 것도 어렵다는 걸 이제 많은 사람들이 깨닫고 있다. 하지만, 가장 어려운 현실은, 연구개발을 하고 승인을 받아도, 결국 돈을 벌기 위해선 배양육 제품을 팔아야 하는데, 시장에서 수용할 수 있는 가격대에 대량 생산하기 위해서는 상상 이상의 돈이 설비와 공장에 투입돼야 하므로 투자자들이 이젠 이 분야를 등한시하고 있다는 내용이다.\n실은, 순수 소프트웨어 사업이 아닌, 사람의 개입이 필요한 operation이 필수인 사업도 비슷한 문제에 항상 직면해 있긴 하다. 멀리 볼 필요도 없고 가까운 스트롱 포트폴리오 네트워크에만 보더라도 이런 회사들이 수두룩하다. 대표적인 예가 모바일 세탁소 세탁특공대인데, 앱으로 세탁을 맡길 수 있지만, 결국엔 회사에서 세탁물을 수거해서 본인들이 직접 운영하는 세탁공장으로 운반하고, 여기서 세탁한 후에 다시 고객들에게 배송해야 한다. 분명 소프트웨어 비즈니스이지만, 사업의 절반 이상이 전통적인 물류와 공장 운영이다. 굉장히 돈이 많이 필요하고, 상상 이상의 돈이 설비와 공장에 투입되어야 한다는 점은 위에서 언급한 배양육 회사와 크게 다르지 않다.\n하지만, 한 가지 다른 점이 있다면, 세탁이라는 업은 첫 매출을 만들기 위한 R&D는 필요 없다. 사업을 개선해서 더 많은 매출을 만들기 위한 R&D는 있지만, 이게 없어도 세탁업은 시작할 수 있고, 매출을 만들 수 있다. 이렇게 만든 매출과 다른 의미 있는 수치를 기반으로 계속 적당한 밸류에이션에 투자 받으면서 사업을 키울 수 있다.\n하지만, 배양육 사업은 오랜 기간 동안 아주 무거운 R&D 과정을 거치지 않으면, 제품 자체가 만들어지지 않기 때문에, 실제로 돈을 버는 건 시작도 못 한다. 사업을 시작하지 못하고, 돈을 아예 못 벌면, 투자받는 게 쉽지 않다. 경기가 아주 좋을 땐, 기술력을 평가하고 미래의 수익성을 기반으로 좋은 조건에 큰 투자를 하는 투자자들이 꽤 있다. 실은 우리 투자사 셀미트를 비롯한 이 분야의 많은 회사들이 몇 년 전만 해도 이런 식으로 투자를 잘 받았다. 하지만, 요새 같은 불경기에 투자자들이 회사를 판단하는 가장 중요한 기준은 매출이다. 투자자들은 매출을 선호하고, 더 나아가서 수익을 선호한다. 이 상황에서 팔 제품 자체가 없는 스타트업은 어떻게 수익을 만들고, 어떻게 투자를 받을 수 있을까?\n아마도 이런 상황에 놓인 창업가들이 꽤 있을 것 같고, 최근에 이런 고민을 하는 분과 잠깐 이야기를 했는데, 이분이 나한테 열변을 토했다. “아니, 아직 제품도 없는데 어떻게 매출을 만드나요? 어떻게 우리 같은 회사의 밸류에이션을 매출을 기반으로 산정합니까? 그러면 우린 밸류에이션이 0인 회사인데요.”\n이분은 시드 투자를 받아서 한 2년 동안 열심히 R&D를 해고, 연구 결과도 좋고 방향도 좋아서 실제 제품을 만들고 매출을 발생시키기 위해 추가 투자를 받아야 하는데, 만나는 대부분의 투자자들이 매출이 없어서 거절하거나, 관심 있는 투자자는 매출이 없어서 (본인이 생각하기엔) 터무니없이 낮은 기업 가치를 제시하는 좋지 않은 상황에 부닥쳐있다.\n솔직히 나도 이분에게 특별히 해 줄 말이 없었다. 경기가 좋고 시장에 돈이 넘쳐흐를 땐, 제품도 없고 매출이 없어도 기술 그 자체나 시장의 가능성에 투자하는 VC들이 많았지만, 이젠 대부분의 VC들이 매출이 발생하는 회사를 선호하고, 어떤 VC는 매출로도 부족하고 손익분기를 해서 이익이 발생하는 회사에만 투자하고 있기 때문에 위에서 말한 창업가가 투자받는 건 정말 힘들기 때문이다. 만약에 이런 상황에 처한 창업가가 있다면, 그냥 최대한 많은 투자자를 만나서 제품과 매출이 없는 회사에도 투자하는 곳을 찾는 수밖에 없다. 만약에 운 좋게 이런 곳을 찾더라도, 회사의 밸류에이션과 투자 조건을 결정하는 건 전적으로 투자자의 특권이 될 수밖에 없다. 이 말을 쉽게 해석해 보면, 투자받는 것도 mission impossible이고, 운 좋게 우리 회사에 관심 갖는 투자자를 찾더라도 좋지 않은 조건에 투자받아야 한다는 의미다.\n입장 바꿔서 이야기를 한번 해보고 싶다. 즉, 이런 회사들을 자주 만나는 VC의 입장에서,,,실은 지금 이런 상황에 부닥친 회사에 투자하면, 정말 매력적인 조건에 투자할 수 있다. 이 회사에 살아 남아서 정말로 좋은 기술로 좋은 제품을 만들 수 있다면, 시간은 오래 걸리지만, 매출이 발생하기 시작하면 확실한 해자를 만들면서 성장하기 때문에 멈출 수 없을 정도로 매출이 잘 나올 것이다. 특히나, 이런 기술을 잘 이해하고, 이 시장을 잘 이해하고 있는 대기업의 전략적 투자 부서가 이런 플레이를 스마트하게 하면, 그 대기업의 미래 먹거리를 생각보다 쉽게 확보할 수도 있다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "역대 최악의 성적이 예상됐지만, 반대로 한국이 역대 최고의 성적을 거둔 파리 올림픽이 지난주에 잘 마무리됐다. 나는 대부분의 올림픽 종목을 별로 안 좋아하지만, 국가 대표들이 열심히 경쟁하는 경기라서 그런지 매일 저녁 한국이 참여하는 대부분의 종목을 와이프랑 정말 재미있게 봤던 즐거운 2주였다. 한국은 금 13개, 총 32개의 메달을 따면서 8위로 끝났는데 너무 잘했고, 모두 너무 자랑스럽다. 안세영 선수의 발언과 더불어 그동안 변화를 수용하지 못한 여러 협회에 대한 불미스러운 일들도 있었지만, 나는 이런 과정이 체육협회와 선수들이 모두 다 한 단계 더 성장하는 계기가 되길 바란다.\n스포츠를 각본 없는 드라마라고 하는데, 이번 파리 올림픽에서도 다양한 이변이 많았고, 메달이 당연시됐던 선수들이 형편없는 성적으로 예선 탈락했고, 전혀 기대되지 않았던 선수들이 선전해서 메달을 따기도 했다. 우리나라 태권도 김유진 선수가 그중 하나였던 것 같은데, 세계 랭킹 12위가 세계랭킹 1위와 2위를 모두 이기고 금메달을 획득한 건, 태권도 전문가들의 말에 의하면 이변 중 대이변이었다.\n이 선수 외에도 랭킹이 한참 아래였거나, 거의 무명의 선수들이 메달을 획득한 사례가 다른 나라에도 몇 개 있었는데, 이 중 몇 명의 경기 후 인터뷰를 보면, 다들 하는 말이 거의 비슷했다. 다른 사람들은 이 선수들의 외부 랭킹만 보고 승패를 예측하지만, 정작 본인들은 스스로가 얼마나 열심히 연습하고 훈련했는지 알기 때문에, 충분히 우승할 수 있다고 믿고 있었고, 이런 땀과 노력은 절대로 배신하지 않는다는 걸 알기 때문에 남들은 이변이라고 하는 결과가 본인에겐 전혀 놀랍지 않다는 내용이었다. 어떤 선수는 이런 말을 했는데 이 말이 굉장히 인상적이었다. “내 연습량을 내가 잘 알고 있고, 훈련의 양에 있어서는 그 어떤 선수도 나를 능가할 수 없다는 걸 내가 잘 알고 있다. 그래서 나는 이 메달이 전혀 신기하지도, 놀랍지도 않다. 당연히 올림픽이라는 큰 무대에서 질 수도 있다. 하지만, 패배의 원인이 노력의 부족이면 절대로 안 된다. 노력의 부족 때문이 아닌 다른 이유로 진다면, 아쉽겠지만 절대로 후회는 안 한다.”\n실은 내가 우리 창업가분들과 자주 하는 말과 너무 비슷해서 나에겐 더욱더 인상 깊었던 말이었던 것 같다. 우린 모두가 항상 최선을 다해야한다는 말을 밥 먹듯이 하지만, 또 한 편으론 내가 봤을 때 최선을 다하지 않는 분들도 종종 본다. 물론, 이건 굉장히 주관적인 입장이고 최선의 개념은 모두에게 다르다. 어쨌든, 정말로 사업과 본인의 미션에 헌신(=commitment)을 보이면서 최선의 노력을 다하는 건 매우 중요하다고 생각한다.\n사업도 올림픽 경기와 같이, 아무리 열심히 하고 죽기 살기로 노력해도 잘 안될 수도 있다. 아니, 성공의 확률이 낮기 때문에 잘 안되는 게 오히려 어쩌면 정상적이다. 그래서 사업은 실패할 수도 있고, 실패한 사업가들이 욕을 먹는 건 가혹하다고 생각하지만, 그 실패의 원인이 노력의 부족이라면, 비난을 받아도 할 말이 없다고 생각한다.\n나는 우리 포트폴리오 회사들이 더는 버티기 힘들어서 폐업을 결정하면, 이런 대화를 많이 한다. “최선을 다했나요? 대표님만큼 치열하고 열심히 노력한 사업가가 주위에 없을 정도로 열심히 했나요? 그랬다면 잘했습니다. 실패의 원인이 노력의 부족이 아니었다면 편안하게 사업 접고 좀 쉬세요.”\n실패의 원인이 노력의 부족이 되지 않게 모두 다 치열하게 헌신하는 하루, 일주, 그리고 일 년이 되길.",

DTI는 주택담보대출의 원리금만 더하지만 DSR은 한 사람이 가진 거의 모든 빚을 더해 빌려줄 수 있는 돈을 정한다는 점에서 더 강력한 대출 규제라고 할 수 있어요. \n\n2024년부터는 \n스트레스 DSR이 적용돼요 \n스트레스 DSR이란 미래의 금리 인상 위험을 반영한 일정 수준의 ‘가산(스트레스) 금리’를 적용하는 거예요. 미래에 금리가 오를 경우 늘어날 원리금 상환 부담까지 반영하기 때문에 대출한도가 기존보다 줄어들 예정이에요. \n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}.css-wgpbp3{display:block;margin-top:6px;}스트레스 DSR 시행 단계\n스트레스 DSR은 총 3단계로 진행돼요. \n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n1단계는 2024년 2월 26일부터 8월 31일까지 적용돼요. 이때 적용되는 스트레스 금리는 0.38%*로 계산된 스트레스 금리(1.5%)의 25%만 반영했어요. 이에 따라 2024년 상반기 차주별 주택담보대출 한도가 2~4% 줄어들 것으로 예상돼요. \n*매년 2회(상, 하반기)에 걸쳐 주기적으로 변경돼요. 추후 결정되는 스트레스 금리는 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}은행연합회 홈페이지(kfb.or.kr)에서 확인할 수 있어요.\n2024년 9월부터는 2단계 스트레스 DSR을 시행해요. 기본 스트레스 금리의 50%인 0.75%p로 가산금리를 올리고, 은행권 신용대출과 2금융권 주택담보대출까지 포함해요. 여기에 은행권의 수도권 주택담보대출에 대해서는 스트레스 금리를 0.75%p 대신 1.2%p로 상향 적용해요. \n\n신용대출 받으려면\nDSR을 알아야 해요 \n나의 총 대출 금액이 1억원을 넘으면, DSR 40%까지만 대출받을 수 있기 때문이에요. 1년간 갚는 원리금이 연소득의 40%(비은행 50%)를 넘어가게 대출 받을 수 없다는 이야기예요 (전세대출, 중도금대출, 소액 신용대출 등은 제외). \n연봉까지만 빌릴 수 있던 신용대출을 연봉의 2~3배까지 빌릴 수 있도록 허용해주었지만, 사실상 필요한 돈이 1억원 이상이라면 DSR 40%내에서만 빌릴 수 있는 거예요. 상대적으로 연소득이 적은 청년층에 영향이 클 수밖에 없고요.\n\n한도 높이기 위해서는: 연소득이 높아지거나, 매년 내는 원리금 부담을 줄이면 되는데요. 최근 나온 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}10년 만기 신용대출 등을 이용해 매년 내는 원리금 부담을 줄이면 일시적으로 한도를 높일 수 있어요.\n\n\n주택담보대출 받으려면\n3가지 모두 알아야 해요\n부동산은 크게 규제지역과 비규제지역으로 나누어지는데요. 2023년 1월 5일부터 강남, 서초, 송파, 용산 등 서울 4개구를 제외하고는 모두 규제지역(투기과열지구, 조정대상지역)에서 해제됐어요. \n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n1. 규제지역과 비규제지역의 LTV가 달라요 \n\n무주택자, 1주택자는 비규제지역에서는 70%, 규제지역에서는 50%의 LTV가 적용돼요. \n부부합산 연소득이 9,000만 원 이하이고, 규제지역의 주택가격 9억 원 이하, 무주택세대주의 요건을 모두 충족하면 6억 원 한도 내에서 LTV 70%까지 적용받을 수 있어요. \n생애 최초 구입이라면 규제지역 여부와 상관없이 집값의 80%까지 대출받을 수 있어요. 주택 소재 지역이나 주택 가격, 소득과 관계없이 최대 6억 원까지 대출받을 수 있어요. \n\n2. 다주택자도 규제지역에서 주택담보대출을 받을 수 있어요\n그동안 다주택자는 규제지역 내에서 주택담보대출을 받을 수 없었는데요. 2023년부터 규제지역에서도 집값의 최대 30%까지 대출받을 수 있게 됐어요 (LTV 0 → 30%). 비규제지역은 이전과 동일하게 LTV 60%가 적용돼요. \n3. DTI는 지역에 따라 달라요\n\n투기지역, 투기과열지구는 40% 적용해요. (서울 강남, 송파, 서초, 용산) \n조정대상지역은 50% 적용하고, 그 외에서는 60%가 적용돼요. \n생애 최초 구입자와 서민 등 실수요자는 투기지역 여부 관계없이 60%로 완화돼요.\n\n4. DSR도 적용돼요 \nLTV, DTI 규제가 완화됐지만 1억 원 넘게 대출받을 때 DSR 40% 규제는 유지돼요. 2024년부터는 위에서 설명한 스트레스 DSR도 추가되기 때문에, 내가 받는 대출이 해당하는지 살펴봐야 해요. \n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 송수아 Graphic 이은호 이서영\n\n- 이 콘텐츠는 2022년 12월 19일 작성됐고, 2024년 8월 20일 업데이트됐어요.",

Z세대의 62%, 밀레니얼 세대의 59%가 지난 1개월 내 기후변화에 대해 불안하거나 우려의 감정을 느낀 적 있다고 답한 것인데요. 2023년 진행된 동일한 서베이에서도 기후변화가 top 5 내에 들었었는데, 작년에 이어 올해에도 꼽혔습니다.\nMZ세대는 문제 의식에 대해 누군가가 해결해 줄 때까지 기다리지 않고, 내 생활 주변에서 할 수 있는 것부터 행동하려는 특징이 있습니다. 기업이 기후변화를 늦추는 데에 적극적으로 참여해야 한다 생각하며, 소비자들이 지속가능한 선택을 할 수 있도록 기업이 도움이 되어야 한다고 주장하는데요. 그래서 이들은 소비를 할 때뿐 아니라 커리어를 결정할 때에도 중요한 기준으로 삼는다고 합니다.\n또한 소셜미디어를 활용해 환경보호 관련 챌린지를 만들고, 다양한 사람들이 함께 참여할 수 있도록 적극적으로 행동하기도 하는데요. 대표적으로 플라스틱 사용 줄이기, 재활용 가능한 제품 사용하기, 친환경 제품 구매하기 등의 활동이 있습니다.\n그중 최근 가장 주목받고 있는 활동은 ’플로깅(Plogging)’입니다. 플로깅이란 '줍다'라는 뜻의 스웨덴어 플로카 업(plocka upp)과 '달리다'라는 뜻의 영어 조깅(Jogging)을 합성한 단어예요. 쓰레기를 주우며 조깅하는 행동을 의미합니다. 우리말로는 '줍깅'이라고도 하죠. 이 활동은 조깅을 하면서 동시에 환경을 보호할 수 있는 일석이조의 효과를 거둘 수 있어 많은 이들의 관심을 받고 있습니다.\n이밖에도 플로깅과 비슷한 ’비치코밍(Beach Combing)’이라는 해변 정화 활동도 있어요. 해변을 빗질하듯 쓰레기나 표류물을 주워 모으는 것을 말하는데요. 바다에 쓸려오는 쓰레기가 워낙 많다보니 해안가에 쓰레기가 쌓이는데, 이는 해양생물에 안 좋은 악영향을 미칠 뿐 아니라 선박 사고의 원인이 되기도 합니다.\n지난해 방영됐던 tvN 드라마 ⟨무인도의 디바⟩에 이런 플로깅, 비치코밍 활동이 나왔는데요. 극 중 PD로 나오는 보걸(채종협)은 대학 때부터 무인도를 다니며 쓰레기를 치우는 일을 합니다. 그가 이 일을 시작한 것은 배에서 실종된 친구 목하(박은빈)를 찾기 위해서였는데요. 목하를 찾겠다는 목적이 우선이었지만, 그는 해변을 따라 걸으며 쓰레기를 줍는 봉사활동을 통해 환경 보호에도 적극적으로 주도합니다.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}출처: .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}tvn 무인도의 디바\n드라마에 이런 활동이 나온 덕분에, 해변에 쌓이는 어마어마한 바다 쓰레기를 치우는 일을 누가 시키지 않아도 환경을 지키겠다는 마음으로 꾸준히 해오는 사람들이 있다는 걸 알게 된 시청자들이 많았을 텐데요. 이렇게 엠제코 세대의 환경 보호 활동이 사람들에게 간접적으로 노출된다면, 환경보호로 이어지는 개인의 노력이 관심을 더 많이 받을 수 있을 것으로 기대됩니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}'엠제코' 패션시장 큰 손 부상…'슬로 패션' 매출 껑충\n(아시아경제 2024.6.17)\n오래 입을 수 있는 옷을 구매하려는 것은 전 세계적인 트렌드이다. 글로벌 리서치 기관 리포트링커(Report Linker)는 지속가능한 패션 시장 규모는 2022년 기준 76억 달러에서 2029년 111억 달러로 확대될 것으로 보고 있다.\n업계에선 패스트 패션에서 슬로 패션으로 관심이 옮겨간 배경으로 환경을 생각해 지속가능한 소비를 추구하는 소비자가 많아진 점을 꼽는다. 코트라(KOTRA) 보고서에 따르면 패스트 패션 트렌드로 인해 해마다 생산하는 의류 중 87%는 매집지나 소각장으로 향하고 있다. 또 총 온실가스 배출량의 4%는 패션 산업에서 발생하고 있다. 코트라 보고서는 \"미국 패션 산업은 생산된 의류를 재활용하거나 필요한 옷만을 구매하려는 경향이 짙어지고 있다\"고 밝혔다.\n국내 패션 대기업 관계자는 \"요즘에는 트렌드를 좇아가려는 소비보다는 본인의 개성과 이 소비를 통해 어떤 가치를 가져갈 수 있는지가 더 중요해졌다\"며 \"과거와 달리 재활용한 의류제품에 대한 수요가 커진 이유\"라고 분석했다.\n국내 패션업계도 이 같은 소비 흐름에 맞춰 친환경 의류를 속속 선보이고 있다. 환경을 중요한 가치관으로 삼은 '엠제코(MZ세대+에코(환경)'를 타깃으로 주요 패션 브랜드와 협업도 이어가고 있다. (중략)\n\n\n최근 패션 업계에서는 트렌드와 유행에 따라 빠르게 입고 빠르게 버리는 ‘패스트(FAST) 패션’보다는, 이와 반대되는 개념의 '슬로(SLOW) 패션' 제품이 큰 호응을 얻고 있습니다. 패스트 패션은 빠르게 유행하는 옷을 저렴한 가격에 사서 빠르게 버리는 것을 특징으로 하는데 반해, 슬로 패션은 오래 입을 수 있는 옷을 선호하는 것을 뜻해요.\n슬로 패션을 선호하는 사람들은 버려지는 옷 때문에 지구 환경이 오염되는 것을 막기 위해 질 좋고 튼튼한 옷을 찾습니다. 이들은 트렌디하게 자신의 외모를 보여주기보다는 환경을 생각하는 자신의 의지를 보여주는 것을 더 중요하게 생각하기 때문이죠.\n특히 MZ 세대 중심으로 가치 소비를 추구하는 경향이 강해지고 있습니다. 이들은 자신의 가치관에 맞는 제품을 구매하고, 이를 통해 자신의 개성을 표현하고자 하는데요. 이러한 변화로 인해 슬로 패션 제품의 매출이 증가하고 있습니다.\n국내 패션 업계도 이러한 변화에 대응하기 위해 친환경 의류와 재활용 제품 등을 다양하게 선보이고 있습니다. 여러 패션 브랜드에서 버려지는 옷을 재활용하여 새로운 옷을 만드는 프로젝트, 지속 가능한 소재를 사용한 제품 출시, 재활용 가능한 포장재 사용 등 환경 보호를 위해 적극적으로 노력하고 있습니다.\n해외 슬로 패션의 대표 사례는 파타고니아(Patagonia)가 있죠. 친환경 패션의 선두주자 중 하나로, 지속 가능한 소재와 윤리적 생산 방식을 채택하는 미국의 아웃도어 브랜드입니다. 파타고니아에서는 ‘Worn Wear’ 프로그램을 운영해오고 있는데요. 파타고니아 브랜드 제품이 아니더라도 어떤 의료 제품이든 무료로 수선해줍니다. 전문 수선사가 바지 밑단 길이나 허리를 줄여주는 것은 물론, 구멍난 양말도 메워줘요. 새 옷을 사기보다 기존 옷을 수선해 오래 입는 것을 권장하는 캠페인입니다.\n우리나라에도 폐플라스틱을 재활용한 리사이클 소재로 멋진 제품을 만드는 브랜드 .css-wi4a2c{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-weight:bold;}플리츠마마가 있는데요. 제주, 서울, 부산 등 국내 여러 지역에서 수거한 페트병을 재활용한 리젠 폴리에스터 원사, 해양 폐기물로 분류되는 폐어망들을 재활용한 리젠 나일론 등 다양한 친환경 소재로 플리츠 디자인의 가방을 만들고 있습니다.\n이러한 변화는 1) 패션 산업이 환경에 미치는 영향을 최소화하고, 지속 가능한 발전을 추구하는 데 큰 도움이 될 것이고, 2) 나아가 자원 낭비를 줄이고, 3) 오래 입을 수 있는 옷을 구매함으로써 소비자들은 옷을 구매하는 데 드는 비용을 절약할 수 있는 효과를 기대해 볼 수 있습니다. 한 줄로 요약하자면, 슬로 패션을 통해 환경 보호와 경제적 이익을 동시에 추구할 수 있는 것이죠.\n\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n지속 가능한 패션 (Sustainable Fashion): 환경에 미치는 영향을 최소화하고 자원을 효율적으로 사용하는 패션. 유기농 면이나 재활용 폴리에스터 같은 친환경 소재를 쓰거나, 제조 공정에서 에너지와 물 사용량을 최소화하거나, 노동자의 인권을 보호하고 공정한 임금을 지급하는 등 윤리적 생산을 한 제품을 말해요.\n미닝 아웃 (Meaning Out): 개인의 가치관이나 윤리적 기준에 따라 제품을 선택하는 소비 방식. 신념을 뜻하는 '미닝(Meaning)'과 드러낸다는 '커밍아웃(Coming Out)'의 합성어로, 자신의 신념과 가치관을 소비 행위로 표현하는 것을 말해요. 단순히 제품의 가격이나 성능만을 고려하는 것이 아니라, 제품이 가지는 사회적, 환경적 가치를 고려하여 구매를 결정하게 됩니다.\n디지털 네이티브 (Digital Native): 디지털 기술이 발전한 환경에서 태어나고 자란 세대. 디지털 기술에 대한 이해도가 높고, 이를 적극적으로 활용하는 특징을 가지고 있어요. 주로 MZ세대가 여기에 해당돼요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건\n\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n💡 ⟨이번 주 경제 용어⟩ 시리즈는 다음주부터 3주 간 휴재합니다. 재정비 후 9/12(목)에 돌아올게요!",
