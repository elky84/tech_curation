        "content:encodedSnippet": "Every year, thousands of developers take part in the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey, helping us map the evolving landscape of software development worldwide. Published in eight languages with data from 20 geographical regions, the survey includes China – a fast-evolving market that shares many global characteristics while retaining distinct traits of its own. \nFor example, Java remains the most widely used language in many Chinese industries – a pattern that differs from global trends and reflects the country’s vast mobile and enterprise sectors. At the same time, rising adoption of Go and TypeScript points to a growing focus on scalability, developer experience, and modern web architectures.\nThanks to the contributions of our survey participants, we’re able to offer a closer look at the Chinese developer ecosystem, including insights not featured in our published infographics. We hope these findings are valuable not only to developers working in China, but also to those less familiar with the market who may find it fascinating to compare local practices with global trends.\nSoftware development trends in China: It’s all in the details\nBroadly, the coding landscape in China looks similar to that of many other regions: STEM graduates with backgrounds in computer science, trained in widely adopted languages and tools, applying their skills in various industries. But to understand what truly shapes this market, it’s vital to look beneath the surface – and that’s where the differences emerge.\n 1.  The prevalence of Java for coding\nWhile Java remains a popular development language worldwide, it is far more common among Chinese developers than in most other regions.\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, an average of 27.76% of professional developers use Java as their primary development language, with Java, JavaScript, and Python forming a relatively balanced “big three”. In China, however, Java stands out clearly: it’s the first choice of 58.17% of Chinese developers.\n\n\n\n    \n“The dominance of Java in the Chinese market is fundamentally driven by the explosive growth of its internet industry and the resulting established technology stacks. China’s massive wave of e-commerce, fintech, and social media startups standardized on Java in their early stages. They built their core, high-throughput, distributed systems on proven Java frameworks like Spring and Apache Dubbo. This created a massive ecosystem and a self-reinforcing cycle: Companies use Java because the talent pool is large, and developers learn Java because that’s where the jobs are.\n\r\nThere’s also the Android factor. Before Kotlin became the preferred language, the massive adoption of Android smartphones in China cemented Java’s position for years as the primary language for mobile app development, further expanding its developer base.”\n\n            \nJoseph Du\n                                                                Customer Success Engineer\n                                    \n2. Widespread mini-app adoption vs. limited cloud service development in China\nIn Developer Ecosystem 2025, Chinese developers show a significantly higher tendency to develop mini-apps compared to the global developer community: 30.27% of professional developers in China are involved in mini-app development. The two most popular solutions are uni-app (35.06%) and Weixin native (34.21%), though 22.39% of developers report dissatisfaction with the current tooling ecosystem.\nMini-apps (小程序) are deeply integrated into daily life in China. A single mobile app can host a wide range of services, from messaging and taxi booking to food delivery and business registration. These lightweight applications run inside larger platforms and typically rely on platform-specific frameworks, such as WeChat Mini Programs and uni-app, combining JavaScript, custom markup languages, and CSS-like styles.\nThis year, the WebStorm team introduced a highly requested WeChat Mini Program plugin for working with Weixin native, with support from user research. This plugin adds native support for WXML, WXSS, and WXS syntax, allowing developers to work directly in WebStorm without switching between the WeChat IDE and their primary editor. It also reduces time spent checking component documentation. More details about the WeChat Mini Program plugin are available in this blog post.\n\n\n\n\n3.  Publicly traded companies outweigh privately owned ones\nOur third theme looks at where developers work and the types of organizations they are part of. The chart displays a diverse mix of company types, highlighting how the distribution in China differs from the global picture.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivately owned companies: Chinese respondents are more likely to work for startups (24%) and large publicly traded companies (24%), compared to the global averages of 16% and 16%, respectively. The more striking difference, however, lies in ownership structure – only 22% of Chinese developers work for private companies, compared to 32% worldwide.\nMultinational corporations: Just 10% of developers in China are employed by multinationals, far below the global average of 19%.\nB2B vs. B2C: Business orientation also differs. In China, 39% of developers work in B2B and 28% in B2C, compared to 58% in B2B and 35% in B2C globally. This suggests a stronger consumer-facing focus in the Chinese market, where developers more often contribute to end-user products and services.\n\n\n\n\n4.  A perspective on low-code / no-code\nChinese developers show a stronger tendency to actively engage with low-code/no-code platforms compared to the global average.\n\n\n\n\nChinese developers are more likely to both build applications using these tools (17% vs. 10% globally) and to develop systems that support other users (14% vs. 4%). Business process automation (BPA) remains the top use case worldwide and in China.\nThe big gap appears in building websites and applications: 30% of Chinese respondents use low-code/no-code for building websites and applications, compared to just 17% globally.\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, low-code/no-code is still viewed primarily as a tool for business processes and rapid prototyping. In China, however, it has become part of a broader productivity-driven culture, with developers not only using these tools themselves but also enabling others to build and automate through them.\n5. Chinese LLM landscape: Foreign LLMs remain the top choice\nChinese developers show a distinct pattern in their use of AI tools. GitHub Copilot is significantly less popular in China than worldwide (26% vs. 38%), while Cursor has gained remarkable traction and is used by 23% of Chinese developers compared to 11% globally.\nGlobal leaders like ChatGPT and Claude are also far less represented in China. Instead, local alternatives, such as DeepSeek and TONGYI Lingma, play a major role, reflecting a strong preference for domestic or self-hosted solutions.\nNote: The list of LLMs in the survey was limited, with no open field. As a result, the findings reflect only the tools included in the questionnaire rather than the full market landscape.\n\n\n\n\nClosing thoughts\nThe insights in this post go beyond what you’ll find in our public infographics, which do not include comparison filters. We’re glad to share these deeper perspectives into the Chinese developer ecosystem, and we’re especially grateful to everyone who took part in our survey – your contributions make it possible for us to capture and understand these unique trends.\nIf you’d like to take part in future studies and help us learn more about how developers work around the world, we invite you to join the JetBrains Tech Insights Lab. \nTo stay updated on new findings, stories, and behind-the-scenes perspectives, subscribe to the JetBrains Research Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Compose Hot Reload has just been promoted to stable with our 1.0.0 release. We worked hard to build a technology that is easy to use and well-integrated into existing tools while also requiring zero configuration from users. The tool is bundled with Compose Multiplatform, starting from version 1.10 (see our dedicated release blog post). While we’re happy to have built tooling that doesn’t really require users to think about its technical implementation, we’re also immensely proud of the engineering behind the project. This blog post highlights some of the technical aspects we find most interesting and provides a high-level overview of how Compose Hot Reload works under the hood.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we’ve built so far\nCompose Multiplatform is a declarative framework for sharing UIs across multiple platforms. Typically, if you’d like to launch a Compose application during development, you need to invoke the corresponding Gradle build tasks or otherwise launch it directly from within the IDE. This is also the case with Compose Hot Reload. Launching your application can be done by invoking the ./gradlew :myApp:hotRunJvm task or clicking Run with Compose Hot Reload in IntelliJ IDEA (assuming that the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin has already been installed).\nOnce the app launches in hot-reload mode, we see a floating toolbar right next to the application window. Changing code within IntelliJ IDEA and clicking Save (Cmd+S/Ctrl+S) will recompile the relevant code, perform a hot reload, and update the UI accordingly while preserving all parts of the state that are still considered valid.\nNote: Screen recordings were made using the latest Compose Hot Reload version, 1.1, which differs visually from the 1.0 release but is conceptually equivalent.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond simply changing the image resources, Compose Hot Reload lets you make almost arbitrary changes to your code, including but not limited to adding and removing functions, classes, and parameters – in short, all the kinds of changes you typically make during regular development.\nThe floating toolbar next to your application offers additional features, such as the ability to view logs, manually trigger a reload, and reset the UI state, as well as status indications and more. One of the most critical aspects of any hot-reload user experience, however, is communicating whether something went wrong. As the developer, you should always be acutely aware when reloading fails, causing your current code changes not to be reflected in the application. This could happen, for example, if you try to reload but the code cannot compile and requires your attention. In such cases, Compose Hot Reload will prominently display the error right in the target application’s window.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s decompose Compose Hot Reload\nLooking at the example above, let’s break Compose Hot Reload into its separate components and try to understand their individual purposes. In this section, we will recreate the process of building the core of Compose Hot Reload from the ground up, before proceeding to an explanation of the more technical details in the following sections.\nFirst things first, the main requirement for Compose Hot Reload is the ability to update the application while it is running dynamically. To achieve this, we need to answer two questions: How do we reload code that is already running dynamically, and when should we do it? Without first answering these questions, the technology will not work. \nThe how part can be achieved in multiple ways in the JVM world: using custom classloaders, JVM hot swapping, and via various other methods. But what really makes Compose Hot Reload work so well is the JetBrains Runtime and its DCEVM implementation, which we’ll cover in detail later.\nWith the how being taken care of by DCEVM, we need to decide on the when. In other words, we need a way to run the application with DCEVM, detect when the user makes changes, recompile the code, and trigger the reload. That’s right, we need an integration with the application’s build system – a plugin that will provide us access to applications’ build and launch configurations.\nIt would seem that these components should provide everything we need, right? We can integrate with the application’s build system and trigger code reloads when the user changes their code! Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. You see, dynamically changing the code will not re-render the application’s UI. Even worse, changes to the code can now lead to errors when interacting with the UI. For example, what will happen if a user interacts with a button that no longer exists in the code? Therefore, we also need a way to interact with the Compose framework and re-render the UI when necessary. Luckily, the Compose Runtime provides APIs to invalidate states and re-render UIs, so we just need to correctly invoke them after the code is reloaded.\nGood news: these three components are sufficient to provide the core functionality of Compose Hot Reload! But to truly elevate the user experience, we need to provide quick visual feedback on the current state of the hot reload. That’s why Compose Hot Reload also offers:\nIn-app notifications about the state of any hot reloads.\nA custom toolbar next to the application window, which allows us to track the status and control the state of a given hot reload.\nIntegration with an IDE that allows you to easily run the application with Compose Hot Reload and monitor its state.\nNow that you have the rough outline of Compose Hot Reload, let’s dive deeper into its technical implementation. There is a lot to discover!\nReloading code dynamically: DCEVM and the JetBrains Runtime \nAs previously mentioned, Compose Hot Reload relies heavily on the JetBrains Runtime to run the user code. Not only is the JetBrains Runtime specialized in building UI applications, it is also, to date, the only JVM to implement the DCEVM proposal published in 2011 by Thomas Würthinger, Christian Wimmer, and Lukas Stadler. This proposal enhances virtual machines’ ability to reload code. Where a regular JVM is limited to just reloading function bodies, DCEVM proposes “unrestricted and safe dynamic code evolution for Java”, which lifts the restrictions and supports almost arbitrary code changes. Here’s an example demonstrating how the JetBrains Runtime can perform more complex reloads:\n\n\n\n\nThe given program creates an instance of the class Foo and prints it every second in an endless loop.\nWhen reloading, the class was modified, and a second property y was added. This begs the question: How can the program and the current state be reloaded in this way? Once the developer edits the code and compiles it, Compose Hot Reload sends the updated .class files to the currently running application, requesting that it reload. The request will be handled over several subsequent steps. \nThe first step can be called “verification”: The JetBrains Runtime will check whether the new .class files are valid and can generally be reloaded. If the code passes all checks, it can proceed to the second stage, “loading”. Then, the JetBrains Runtime will load all classes into what we call a “side universe”. This will represent the application code (all loaded classes) after the reload.\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, the side universe can be thought of as a second instance of your application, containing all updated application code, but without any state or threads executing. The above example shows the changed Foo.class marked in green, indicating that it points to an updated version of the class.\nThe current state of the application is then required to migrate objects to this side universe: We call this a “state transfer”. This state transfer is implemented as a special garbage collection (GC) pass. GC has a few properties that are useful for implementing the state transfer. Not only is it possible to “stop the world” (wait for all application threads to reach safe points), but GC is also allowed to allocate new memory and move objects to new locations!\nTo demonstrate this for the previous example, we can look at the instance created by val foo = Foo(1). The actual instance might look something like this in your memory:\n\n\n\n\nThis is where the object currently resides at a known memory location. The memory representation of our object starts with a 16-byte header containing metadata about our object, for example, a pointer or a compressed pointer to our runtime representation of the class (called Klass). Right after the header, we can find the actual fields stored in the object. In our case, we see the value 1 associated with the property x. Memory before or after our object is unknown and could contain basically anything. When a reload changes a class’s layout by adding or removing properties, it becomes clear that the object needs to be adjusted.\nThis is where the nature of GC works well for migrating the object. GC can allocate a new block of memory to account for the object’s new size, and then start migrating the object by copying its previous values. In the chosen example, we added one more int field, requiring us to allocate 32 additional bits of memory. Since the x field was unchanged, we can just copy the previous value to its new location. However, a decision has to be made on how to treat the newly introduced field y. Re-running the constructor is not feasible, so DCEVM uses the JVM defaults: null, 0, and false.\n\n\n\n\nNote that the new object has a different header that points to the new Klass object, representing the reloaded code.\nOnce all objects are migrated, all pointers to them will be updated to point to the migrated objects. In our example above, the instance Foo has moved to a new memory location and now carries a y property. \nBefore we can resume the application, the runtime needs to consider that previous optimizations and just-in-time compilations to machine code might be invalid. For this reason, the code is then “de-optimized”. Once the application resumes, the JIT compiler is free to kick in again, optimizing our code and returning the application to the previous level of performance.\nJava agents FTW\nDCEVM is an amazing technology that allows you to dynamically reload and redefine code while it is executing. However, to make it actually work, we need a way to call its APIs from the user application. \nLuckily, the JVM has a way to implement that – it’s called a Java agent. A Java agent is a Java library that can be attached to any Java program and execute code before the target program starts.\nTo create a Java agent, we need to declare a class with a premain method. This method, as the name suggests, will be executed before the target application’s main, i.e. during JVM startup. The method takes a String argument and an instance of java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation as its parameters.\nfun premain(args: String, instrumentation: Instrumentation)\njava.lang.instrument.Instrumentation is a part of the Java Instrumentation API, which allows agents to observe, modify, and redefine classes at runtime. When you are using the JetBrains Runtime, java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation provides you with access to DCEVM via its redefineClasses method implementation.\nSo, in the case of Compose Hot Reload, the Java agent’s function is relatively straightforward: We attach it to the target application and launch a background task/thread in the premain. This background task will invoke instrumentation.redefineClasses with new classes whenever it receives information about changes to the application’s code. \nFinally, we just need to package our agent as a standalone JAR and give the agent information required by the JVM in the manifest file:\nPremain-Class: org.jetbrains.compose.reload.agent.ComposeHotReloadAgent\nCan-Redefine-Classes: true  // declare that we intend to redefine classes\nIn practice, we use the Compose Hot Reload agent for much more than just redefining classes via DCEVM. We will cover its other functions in the following sections.\nYou may have noticed that we boldly skipped one of the most important parts of any hot reload by simply claiming that the agent “receives information about changes in the code”. It is, indeed, not so simple. However, to get the whole picture, we first have to dive into another complex subsystem of Compose Hot Reload – its integration with build systems.\nBuilding a zero-configuration tool\nThe combination of the JetBrains Runtime’s ability to reload code and an agent that can listen for reload requests form the core functionality of Compose Hot Reload. Integrating these components into a zero-configuration product requires careful integration into build tools. The following describes how the Gradle plugin is implemented, but hot reload is also available in Amper. The user-facing workflows can be separated into two typical kinds of builds: In the first, the user compiles the application and intends to launch it in hot-reload mode. In the second kind of build, there will be multiple reloads. These consist of incrementally compiling the code, and then sending the reload request to the agent after a given change. Reload requests typically contain all .class files that have been either changed, added, or modified. While reloading can be triggered manually, it is typically managed either by Compose Hot Reload itself or by the IDE, which watches source files for changes. \nThis leads to two questions: \nHow can the set of changed files be resolved efficiently when reloading?\nHow can other tools reliably issue reloads?\n\n\n\n\nThe flow of launching the application already gives a lot of insights into how the overall system works, and it is relatively straightforward: \nThe entire project is compiled, as usual, and produces the corresponding .class files. Typically, applications can launch directly afterwards by launching the JVM with all necessary arguments (classpath, properties, JVM arguments, user arguments, etc.). A hot reload run will then perform two additional steps before actually launching.\nAfter the compilation finishes, a snapshot of the classpath is taken. It’s worth mentioning that Compose Hot Reload differentiates the classpath into a hot and cold part. Dependencies resolved from remote repositories are considered cold because they won’t change during a hot reload session. Code compiled by the current build, however, is considered hot. The snapshot is therefore only taken of the hot part of the classpath and contains all known .class files, each with a checksum of its contents.\nThe second task performed by hot reload is to produce special hot-reload arguments for the run. For convenience and to support restarting the application, these arguments will be stored in an .argfile. The most important arguments being:\n-XX:+AllowEnhancedClassRedefinition, which enables the JetBrains Runtime’s DCEVM capabilities.\n-javaagent:/.../hot-reload-agent-1.1.0.jar, which adds our agent to the application.\n-Dcompose.reload.buildSystem=Gradle, which tells Compose Hot Reload to use the Gradle recompiler backend.\n-Dgradle.build.root=/.../myProject, which tells Compose Hot Reload where the current Gradle project is located.\n-Dgradle.build.project=:app, which indicates which Gradle project was launched for hot reload.\n-Dgradle.build.task=hotReloadJvmMain, which tells Compose Hot Reload which Gradle task can be executed to issue a reload.\n-Dcompose.reload.devToolsClasspath=..., which provides the floating toolbar application classpath.\n-Dcompose.reload.devToolsEnabled=true, which enables the floating toolbar application.\nGiven that the application now has all the information necessary to start reloads by invoking the provided Gradle task at the provided location, Compose Hot Reload will start a supervisor process called devTools. This is the same process that will then provide the floating toolbar window. This process will either start a continuous Gradle build for reloading or wait for external events (such as you clicking Reload, or the IDE sending a signal to reload). \nSuch signals can be sent through the orchestration protocol, which we’ll talk about in more detail later. For now, it is just essential to know that the application will host a TCP server that allows components, such as Gradle, Amper, or the IDE, to communicate with each other.\nRequests to reload the application will trigger the corresponding reload task. Such a Gradle invocation will be marked as isHotReloadBuild and will get the application server port forwarded as orchestration.port.\nOnce the project is compiled incrementally, the snapshot will be rebuilt incrementally as well. Comparing the previous snapshot to the new one is quick and produces a map of .class files that are either added, removed, or modified. \nThe last task is to connect to the application using the provided port and send a request to reload those files. The agent will handle this request and reload the code using the JetBrains Runtime.\n\n\n\n\nSince all relevant tasks can be created automatically by inferring them from the Kotlin Gradle Plugin model, the tool can be used effectively without any further configuration. Launching from the CLI only requires calling the corresponding hotRunJvm task. IntelliJ IDEA can import hot reload tasks during the Gradle sync process and create corresponding run gutters.\nBut what about the UI?\nAs we mentioned before, being able to reload the code does not guarantee that Compose Hot Reload will magically start working. Modern applications are far too complex for that to happen. Therefore, after reloading the code, we need to propagate those updates throughout the application, re-rendering the UI, resetting the state, cleaning the references to the old code, etc. \nNow, to do that correctly, we first need to understand how Compose code actually works. Let’s take a look at how our App function from the previous examples is represented.\n@Composable\nfun App() {\n   var clicks by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }\n   MaterialTheme {\n       Column(\n           horizontalAlignment = Alignment.CenterHorizontally,\n       ) {\n           Button(onClick = { clicks++ }) {\n               Text(\"Clicks: $clicks\")\n           }\n\n\n           Icon(\n               imageResource(Res.drawable.Kodee_Assets_Digital_Kodee_greeting),\n               contentDescription = \"Kodee!!!\",\n               modifier = Modifier,\n               tint = Color.Unspecified\n           )\n       }\n   }\n}\nCompose splits the code into sections called groups and assigns each group a unique integer key. As an approximation, you can think that each scope (e.g. each {} pair in the code) corresponds to a separate group. The groups are organized in a tree-like structure that corresponds to their relations in the source code. In this image, green nodes correspond to Compose groups created by the App function, blue nodes represent other Composable functions called in the App function, and white nodes represent state information. \nWhen the Compose Runtime detects that some parts of the UI need to be re-rendered, it marks the groups corresponding to those components as invalid. It then re-executes all the code corresponding to those groups, creating an updated version of the tree. Subsequently, this means that the state created by any invalidated groups will be reset. For example, if we invalidate the group with the key -419397569, the mutable state with the counter will not be reset, while all the other code will be re-executed.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have a high-level understanding of the Compose representation, how do we actually implement hot reload? Well, the intuitive option would be to reuse the Compose Runtime’s existing functionality: If the code changes, we invalidate all groups corresponding to that code. This will allow us to:\nRe-render only the necessary parts of the UI.\nPreserve the state whenever possible.\nClean up all references to the old code.\nTo do that, we need to understand:\nWhat code has been changed?\nWhich Compose groups need to be invalidated because of that change?\nAnd here, the Compose Hot Reload agent comes into play one more time.\nBytecode analysis\nWhen compiling the application, the Compose plugin changes the intermediate representation (IR) of the Composable functions and inserts additional instructions for the Compose Runtime. For example, the bytecode of the App function will start with the following instruction: $composer.startRestartGroup(1359525739).\nHere, startRestartGroup is a special instruction of the Compose Runtime that marks the start of a new group, and its argument is the key for this group. Correspondingly, the end of this group will be marked by a call to endRestartGroup. This means that all the information that we’re interested in is actually contained in the bytecode; we just need to extract it.\nLuckily, the Java agent allows us to hook into the target application and inspect all the classes while they are loading. We use the ASM library to analyze classes, and for each method, we build our own representation of the Compose tree. By locating the startGroup and endGroup calls, we can determine the bounds (and keys) of Compose groups, and their locations in the code define the parent-child relations between them. Conditional branches inside a function can be parsed by tracking jump instructions and their target labels.\n\n\n\n\nFor each Compose group, we determine its key, its relations with other groups, its dependencies on different methods, and its hash. The group’s hash value attempts to capture its semantics; for simplicity, we can think of it as a hash of all the bytecode instructions in this group. It allows us to quickly determine whether the group’s code has changed semantically during reloads.\nTracking changes\nNow that we know how to extract information from the bytecode, we need to think about how to apply it. As we mentioned, a Java agent allows us to analyze every class before it has been loaded. This will enable us to analyze classes not only during initial loading, but also during reloads. Thus, during reload, we can keep track of both the old and new versions of each class and monitor changes.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the class is reloaded, we can compare both its old and new runtime information and invalidate groups using the following rules.\nIf the code hash of a Compose group is changed, invalidate it.\nIf the code hash of a non-Compose function is changed, invalidate all Compose groups that are (transitively) dependent on it. Since we keep track of the entire runtime, we can efficiently compute all method dependencies.\nAfter that, the only thing left to do is to save the new version of the runtime as the current one.\nThe compiler doesn’t like your hot reload stuff\nEven though the core idea of the code invalidation and UI re-rendering approach is not particularly complicated, the path to Compose Hot Reload’s success was blocked by many obstacles and hurdles we had to overcome. Many of them stemmed from the fact that the Kotlin compiler and Compose plugin weren’t built with DCEVM and hot swapping in mind. Therefore, bytecode produced by those tools often behaved unexpectedly during hot reload. In this section, we will highlight some of the technical difficulties we encountered during the development of Compose Hot Reload and how we solved them.\nAll your lambdas belong to us\nBoth Kotlin and Compose encourage heavy use of lambda functions. However, lambda functions were a significant source of inconsistency in the bytecode produced by the Kotlin compiler, mainly due to their names. Users do not provide names for lambda functions; therefore, the compiler generates them itself, using predefined rules to determine each lambda’s name. Unfortunately, those rules are not designed with hot reload in mind.\nThere are two ways a lambda function can be compiled to the bytecode: anonymous classes and indy lambdas. The first way suggests that a lambda is compiled as a class that implements one of Kotlin’s FunctionN interfaces, and the lambda’s body is placed inside the invoke method of this class.\nThe indy way suggests that a lambda is compiled as a function inside the original class, which is then converted into an object in the runtime via the JVM’s invokedynamic instruction and the LambdaMetafactory.\nfun bar() =\n   foo { println(it) }\n\n\nfun foo(a: (Int) -> Unit) {\n   listOf(1, 2, 3).forEach(a)\n}\nClass-based lambda:\nfinal class org/example/project/MainKt$bar$1 extends kotlin/jvm/internal/Lambda implements kotlin/jvm/functions/Function1 {\n   // access flags 0x0\n   <init>()V\n           L0\n   ALOAD 0\n   ICONST_1\n   INVOKESPECIAL kotlin/jvm/internal/Lambda.<init> (I)V\n   RETURN\n\n\n   // access flags 0x11\n   public final invoke(I)V\n   GETSTATIC java/lang/System.out : Ljava/io/PrintStream;\n   ILOAD 1\n   INVOKEVIRTUAL java/io/PrintStream.println (I)V\n   RETURN\n}\nIndy lambda:\npublic final static bar()V\nINVOKEDYNAMIC invoke()Lkotlin/jvm/functions/Function1; [\n// handle kind 0x6 : INVOKESTATIC\njava/lang/invoke/LambdaMetafactory.metafactory(Ljava/lang/invoke/MethodHandles$Lookup;Ljava/lang/String;Ljava/lang/invoke/MethodType;Ljava/lang/invoke/MethodType;Ljava/lang/invoke/MethodHandle;Ljava/lang/invoke/MethodType;)Ljava/lang/invoke/CallSite;\n// arguments:\n(Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;,\n// handle kind 0x6 : INVOKESTATIC\norg/example/project/MainKt.bar$lambda$0(I)Lkotlin/Unit;,\n(Ljava/lang/Integer;)Lkotlin/Unit;\n]\nINVOKESTATIC org/example/project/MainKt.foo (Lkotlin/jvm/functions/Function1;)V\nRETURN\n\n\nprivate final static bar$lambda$0(I)Lkotlin/Unit;\nGETSTATIC java/lang/System.out : Ljava/io/PrintStream;\nILOAD 0\nINVOKEVIRTUAL java/io/PrintStream.println (I)V\nGETSTATIC kotlin/Unit.INSTANCE : Lkotlin/Unit;\nARETURN\nComposableSingleton classes\nCompose attempts to emit every composable lambda function as a singleton, meaning there is only one instance of that lambda function in existence. Therefore, it compiles all the composable lambdas as classes with a ComposableSingleton prefix in their names. Before Kotlin 2.1.20, the Compose compiler traversed nested functions using depth-first search and assigned each lambda class a unique name just using a counter. \nThe problem, however, arises when we introduce changes to the original code:\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, just by adding a single new call to Surface, we caused two significant changes:\nEach lambda class changed, because adding a new lambda at the bottom of the tree caused all the lambda classes in the file to be renamed.\nThe class named ComposableSingleton$AppKt$lambda-0 changed its interface from Function3 to Function2, which causes an error in the JetBrains Runtime during reload, as before version 21.0.8, the JetBrains Runtime did not support changes to class interfaces.\nObviously, these kinds of dramatic bytecode changes are not good when hot reloading. Therefore, we changed how the Compose compiler generates names for composable singleton lambdas. Starting from version 2.1.20, the Compose compiler uses group keys as a stable, unique name for composable lambdas:\n\n\n\n\nThis change ensures that changes to composable lambdas do not cause errors or excessive invalidations in Compose Hot Reload.\nIndy lambdas\nWe encountered similar problems with the names generated for indy lambdas by the Kotlin compiler: Adding a nested lambda anywhere in the code renames all other lambdas.\n\n\n\n\nThis issue leads to the same problems as we observed with ComposableSingletons. However, this issue was reinforced by the fact that it affects all lambdas in the code, and Kotlin switched to indy lambdas by default in 2.0.0.\nTo solve this problem, we have changed the Kotlin compiler. As of Kotlin 2.2.20, indices for indy lambda names are unique for each scope they appear in. This guarantees that:\nRandom changes at the beginning of the file will not affect lambda names at the end of the file.\nAdding nested lambdas will not affect all the other lambdas declared in the class.\n\n\n\n\nFunctionKeyMeta annotations\nThe whole functionality of Compose Hot Reload relies on the fact that we can extract information about Compose from the bytecode. However, consider this example:\n@Composable\nfun App() {\n   Button(onClick = { }) {\n       Text(\"Click me!!!\")\n   }\n}\nThe lambda, passed to a Button call, only creates a single text field and does not create any new Compose groups. The (decompiled) bytecode of this lambda function looks like this:\nfinal class ComposableSingletons$AppKt$lambda$-794152384$1 implements Function3<RowScope, Composer, Integer, Unit> {\n\n\n   @FunctionKeyMeta(\n       key = -794152384,\n       startOffset = 568,\n       endOffset = 603\n   )\n   @Composable\n   public final void invoke(RowScope $this$Button, Composer $composer, int $changed) {\n       Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter($this$Button, \"$this$Button\");\n       ComposerKt.sourceInformation($composer, \"C17@578L19:App.kt\");\n       if ($composer.shouldExecute(($changed & 17) != 16, $changed & 1)) {\n       if (ComposerKt.isTraceInProgress()) {\n           ComposerKt.traceEventStart(-794152384, $changed, -1, \"ComposableSingletons$AppKt.lambda$-794152384.<anonymous> (App.kt:17)\");\n       }\n\n\n       TextKt.Text--4IGK_g(\"Click me!!!\", (Modifier)null, 0L, 0L, (FontStyle)null, (FontWeight)null, (FontFamily)null, 0L, (TextDecoration)null, (TextAlign)null, 0L, 0, false, 0, 0, (Function1)null, (TextStyle)null, $composer, 6, 0, 131070);\n       if (ComposerKt.isTraceInProgress()) {\n           ComposerKt.traceEventEnd();\n       }\n   } else {\n       $composer.skipToGroupEnd();\n   }\n   }\n}\nAs you may notice, the source code of the invoke function does not contain any calls to startGroup or endGroup methods, and we can’t reliably extract the group information from it. The only way to access it is to read the FunctionKeyMeta annotation. This is a special annotation emitted by the Compose compiler that is intended to be used by tooling. \nHowever, before version 2.1.20, there was no way to generate FunctionKeyMeta annotations on composable functions, and there was no way to infer the group key from the bytecode of the compiled composable lambdas. We introduced this option in Kotlin 2.1.20 (which is why it is the required version of Kotlin if you want to use Compose Hot Reload) and enabled it by default in Kotlin 2.2.0.\nLifting the limits of the JetBrains Runtime\nWith the compiler tamed to emit bytecode that can be reloaded, another set of potential issues needs to be solved. One such issue surfaced very early in our testing. What should happen to the state that was statically initialized? The state in question here is not a UI state, stored by Compose, but static values, such as top-level properties. Take a look at the following test, which failed in early versions of Compose Hot Reload.\n\n\n\n\nThe test first defines an enum with the cases A, B, and C, then compiles and reloads the enum definition so that it also contains the case D. This failure is due to the EnumCases.entries being stored statically on the enum class. Once this collection is initialized, reloading this code will not magically cause its state to change to include the new case. Similarly, any other top-level property or static value would not change.\nThis is analogous to managing the state within the Compose framework, which means the same problems need to be solved. \nWe still need a way to reinitialize static values, and we need to know when to do so. This time around, we can answer the question of when to do so much more easily: Our bytecode analysis engine is perfectly capable of finding which functions and properties are considered dirty. However, reinitializing static fields is not as straightforward as calling a function. First, many static fields are also declared as final; re-assigning values cannot be done by calling a given function again, as it would require reflection. Second, the code that initializes statics lives inside a function called clinit. This function cannot be simply invoked, as it’s supposed to be invoked during class loading by the JVM itself. The problem requires transforming the code of .class files that will subsequently be reloaded. The transformation removes all final modifiers from static fields and copies the body of the clinit function to a new, synthetic $chr$clinit function (where chr is short for Compose Hot Reload). When reloading, the clinit method of several classes can be marked as dirty. We enqueue those classes for reinitialization and call them in topological order, according to their dependencies.\n\n\n\n\nWhen this project started, one of the stated limitations of the JetBrains Runtime was that reloads were rejected if either the superclass or any of a class’s interfaces changed while the class had active instances. Since some Kotlin lambdas still compile to abstract classes that implement Function1, Function2, and other interfaces, the limitation prevented some valid user code from reloading. We were able to produce lambda class names that were unique in Compose and much more tame outside of Compose, but users could occasionally encounter this limitation. We’re happy to announce that the team working on the JetBrains Runtime, especially Vladimir Dvorak, has lifted the restriction on changing interfaces and is now working on changing superclasses as well.\nThe orchestration protocol\nWe have previously seen that different processes need to communicate with each other. There are two concepts we can deduce from the required communication:\nEvents: Single-shot pieces of data (something that happened to which other parts of the system can react).\nStates: Current statuses of different Compose Hot Reload components that are continuously updated and available across the entire orchestration. For example, the ReloadState can either be Ok, Reloading, or Failed. This is not just a single event, but a universal state that each component can interact with. You can see that this ReloadState will be displayed in the application, the floating toolbar, and the IDE. \nTypically, such communication patterns can be modelled using higher-level abstractions, such as HTTP, and many would think that Ktor, or kotlinx.rpc might be fitting technologies. We, however, believe that technologies like Compose Hot Reload need to prioritize compatibility over our own developer experience. Using external libraries inside our devtools application is not a problem, but the communication with the user application requires code to run inside the user’s application, and polluting the user’s classpath might lead to frustrating compatibility issues. Shading such libraries can work, but most of those libraries would require kotlinx.coroutines. While kotlinx.coroutines can be shaded, it is designed to be a system-level library, and we would like to keep it this way.\nTherefore, we opted to implement all of the server/client code without any external dependencies. To model async code accurately, we even implemented a tiny coroutines runtime that allows launching tasks, switching threads, offering a Queue option (analogous to a Channel in kotlinx.coroutines), and more. \nThe key aspect of this protocol is that it is both forward- and backwards-compatible. This bi-directional compatibility is verified by running tests in a special way, but we’ll go into more detail on that later.\nDefining a state within a single process is hard enough to get right, but defining it across multiple processes raises the question of how to implement it safely. State updates in Compose Hot Reload are defined atomically and are done through an atomic update function. This means that racing threads, even racing processes, will be able to conveniently update a given state while using a pattern that is widely adopted by application developers:\n\n\n\n\nThe provided update function ensures atomic updates to the state. Like an AtomicReference or a MutableSharedFlow, this update function might be called multiple times if proposed updates are rejected. To enable such atomic updates across numerous processes, the OrchestrationServer acts as the source of truth: Any participant trying to update the state will send binary Update requests to the server. These requests will contain the binary (serialized) form of the expected state and the binary form of the updated state. \nThe server processes all requests in a single Queue. If the expected binary matches, the update gets accepted, and the updated state binary is distributed to all clients. If many threads or processes are racing to update a given state value, the expected binary representation might have changed so that it no longer matches the update request. Such updates will be rejected; the client will receive the new underlying state value, call the update function again, and send a new update request.\n\n\n\n\nFast visual feedback\nWe’ve now covered the internal workings of Compose Hot Reload. But as interesting as all that is, in our opinion, fast visual feedback is the most important part of the hot reload experience. So, how can we provide this feedback, and more importantly, share it across different processes? Well, the key to doing this is the states that are shared between all processes via the orchestration protocol. The hot-reload-devtooling-api module introduces them:\nWindowsState. By hooking into the user application process and intercepting all the ComposeWindow.setContent invocations, we can keep track of all the windows created by the user application. Each window is assigned a unique windowId, and we keep information about the current position of all windows.\npublic class WindowsState(\n   public val windows: Map<WindowId, WindowState>\n) : OrchestrationState {\n   public class WindowState(\n       public val x: Int,\n       public val y: Int,\n       public val width: Int,\n       public val height: Int,\n       public val isAlwaysOnTop: Boolean\n   )\n}\nReloadState. ReloadState keeps track of the current reload status. Basically, it tracks all orchestration messages and updates the state based on reload, recompile, or build status messages exchanged between the processes. \npublic sealed class ReloadState : OrchestrationState {\n   public abstract val time: Instant\n\n\n   public class Ok(\n       override val time: Instant,\n   ) : ReloadState()\n\n\n   public class Reloading(\n       override val time: Instant,\n       public val reloadRequestId: OrchestrationMessageId?\n   ) : ReloadState() {\n\n\n   public class Failed(\n       override val time: Instant,\n       public val reason: String,\n   ) : ReloadState()\n}\nReloadCountState. In addition to the reload state, it is also nice to keep track of the history of reload attempts. Working on the UI of your application and seeing that you have iterated on it over 30 times already is a very inspiring feeling!\npublic class ReloadCountState(\n   \t    public val successfulReloads: Int = 0,\n   \t    public val failedReloads: Int = 0\n) : OrchestrationState\nAs we mentioned before, all these states are shared between the processes. So if you feel like it, you can actually create your own UI tooling for Compose Hot Reload! \nIn-app effects\nThe Compose Hot Reload agent hooks to the user application process and intercepts Compose calls that initialize the window: ComposeWindow.setContent and ComposeDialog.setContent. To be more precise, we don’t just intercept these calls; we actually replace them with our own implementation that wraps the user content into a special DevelopmentEntryPoint function.\n@Composable\npublic fun DevelopmentEntryPoint(\n   window: Window,\n   child: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n   startWindowManager(window)\n   val currentHotReloadState by hotReloadState.collectAsState()\n\n\n   CompositionLocalProvider(hotReloadStateLocal provides currentHotReloadState) {\n       key(currentHotReloadState.key) {\n           when {\n               reloadEffectsEnabled -> ReloadEffects(child)\n               else -> child()\n           }\n       }\n   }\n}\nThis is a very high-level implementation of the DevelopmentEntryPoint. As you can see, it provides us with three key features:\nWe start a window manager that updates the WindowState of the current window.\nWe wrap the user app’s contents in a separate scope guarded by a special hot-reload state. If we ever want to reset the user application’s UI state, we can do so by resetting the hot-reload state.\nWe wrap the user content into the ReloadEffects function, which renders all in-app effects based on the shared states.\nFloating toolbar\nThe floating toolbar, or the Compose Hot Reload Dev tools window, is a separate process that starts together with the user application and connects to the orchestration. Then, it just tracks the WindowsState, and launches a new toolbar for each window of the user application. The toolbar just tracks the target window’s state and updates its position accordingly.\nThe toolbar also contains action buttons that control the user application: Reload UI, Reset UI, and Shutdown. These actions are implemented via the orchestration protocol as well: Clicking a button just triggers a corresponding orchestration message to be sent to all connected processes. Each process then knows how to handle received commands.\n\n\n\n\nIDE integration\nIDE support for Compose Hot Reload is implemented in the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin. When you open a Kotlin Multiplatform project in your IDE, the KMP plugin checks whether the Compose Hot Reload plugin is applied to the project. If it is, the KMP plugin also checks the versions for compatibility (IDEs support Compose Hot Reload versions from 1.0.0-beta07 onward). Via IDE integration with the build systems, the KMP plugin can extract all the information needed to run the app in hot-reload mode. And when you click on the Run button in the gutter next to main, the KMP plugin automatically generates a new run configuration with hot reload enabled.\n\n\n\n\nEverything else works very similarly to the Dev tools window. The KMP plugin connects to the orchestration server of the running application and displays information about the app’s current state: logs, reload status, errors, etc.\nTesting\nThis project required the team to think about many components across the entire Kotlin and JetBrains technology stack, and we have spent a lot of time debugging, experimenting, and writing production code. We would like to claim that most of our time was spent on our project infrastructure. However, we estimate that roughly 30% of all our commits were purely for introducing test infrastructure, highlighting how complicated testing a system that reloads code can be.\nHot-reload unit tests\nTests running assertions within the JVM that reload code are called hot-reload unit tests. An example of such a test case was shown earlier in this blog post.\n\n\n\n\nThe tests here can define code of interest right next to the actual test function. But the real magic happens when calling the compileAndReload method. \nThis method allows us to compile the provided source code within the current process and reload it. Once this compileAndReload method finishes, we can safely assume the new code is available and begin to write assertions. The example above shows a test that defines an enum with three cases. After reloading the enum with one case added, we can safely assert that the .entries property contains the newly added case. This test suite implements a custom test executor for Gradle, which launches each test case in a fresh JetBrains Runtime with hot reload enabled and provides a Kotlin compiler for the compileAndReload function. We used such tests in cases where reloading either crashed or had some issues, as mentioned previously (reinitializing statics).\nHotReloadTestFixture: Orchestration-based tests\nSince this project integrates into many other systems, having a heavier, end-to-end test fixture at our disposal seems natural. Similar to how Gradle plugins would write Gradle integration tests using Gradle-specific fixtures, we have implemented a HotReloadTestFixture that launches actual applications with Gradle in hot-reload mode and communicates with Gradle and the application using the previously mentioned orchestration protocol. Such tests were implemented to cover the integration with the JDWP commands for reloading and testing generic Gradle tasks, but they were also very useful for building screenshot tests:\n\n\n\n\nJust as unit tests do, orchestration-based tests have a convenient way to replace code, thanks to the HotReloadTestFixture; however, this test fixture actually changes source code on disk and thus relies on the entire Gradle/Compose Hot Reload machinery to pick the change up correctly, issue the reload request, and perform other relevant actions, right up until Compose actually updates the UI. After that, the test then takes a screenshot. We have many tests that ensure, through screenshots, that the code change was handled properly, i.e. that only the corresponding state was reset and the UI picked up the changes.\nTesting the backwards and forwards compatibility of the orchestration protocol\nAs we mentioned before, compatibility is one of the key properties of the orchestration protocol. For example, the IDE might have a different client version bundled compared to the server version hosted by the application. \nSuch compatibility tests typically define a communication flow between a server and a client. Let’s say the client connects, the server sends a message Foo, and the client responds with Bar. Now, to test the compatibility, this flow will be separated into two parts: \nThe first part is called main, which contains one side of the communication (e.g. the server’s) and runs with the currently compiled version of the code. The second part is called Isolate, and this code will be running in a separate process, launched with the previous JARs of the protocol.\n\n\n\n\nThe Isolate class can be defined right next to the test function, making it easy to write compatibility test cases where both ends of the communication are close together. Still, only one will be launched in isolation, running the test against many different, previously released versions of Compose Hot Reload.\nContinuing the journey\nCompose Hot Reload is a very complex technical project, and we are proud of the engineering work behind it.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re now working on our next major release, which we plan to deliver in March. In our latest stable version (v2025.3), we introduced many features and enhancements, so for the next release, we’ve decided to focus on maintenance and bug fixes rather than introducing new functionality. With that in mind, we’ve prioritized the following areas for v2026.1:\nLanguage support\nBuild tools and project formats\nFeatures for embedded development\nDebugging\n\n\n\n\nRead on to learn more about our planned updates.\nOur team is committed to creating an IDE that makes development smooth and productive. However, the following is only a preliminary roadmap. We can’t guarantee that all of the issues and features listed below will be addressed and implemented in CLion 2026.1. Unexpected circumstances could require us to modify our plans or implementation timelines for some items.\nLanguage support\nFor CLion’s language support, we plan to concentrate on improving the coding experience, refining compile-time debugging capabilities, and updating testing framework integration.\nLanguage and editor features\nThe CLion Nova language engine powers all of the recent performance and accuracy improvements in CLion. In v2025.3, this engine has become the default for all users, replacing the legacy CLion Classic engine.\nWhile we’re not aiming for complete feature parity between CLion Nova and CLion Classic, we remain committed to implementing the most popular features from the legacy engine. Here’s what we’re adding in this release:\nSupport for Clang blocks (CPP-37839): This non-standard extension provides a lambda-like syntax for creating closures in C and C++. It’s useful for writing concise, type-safe, and context-aware callbacks or asynchronous code.\nSupport for GCC nested functions (RSCPP-35876): This GCC extension lets you define a function inside another function, with the inner function accessible only within the outer function’s scope. This is particularly valuable in embedded systems, where it can help users optimize code and better manage limited resources.\nCode folding improvements: CLion automatically recognizes certain code structures and allows you to fold them. In v2026.1, we plan to support additional code structure types and regions that you can fold to help you better organize your code.\nGo to Usages and Go to Declaration popup improvements (CPP-45132, CPP-46560): We want to address several UX issues with this popup, such as displaying unnecessary information and unintuitive grouping of a function’s declaration and usages.\nConstexpr Debugger improvements\nIn v2025.3, we introduced the Constexpr Debugger, a tool that enables compile-time debugging of constexpr and consteval code, which is hard or impossible to debug at runtime. We’ll continue to refine the Constexpr Debugger and fix bugs in the next release.\nUpdates to unit testing frameworks\nCLion supports multiple unit test frameworks, such as GoogleTest, Catch2, Boost.Test, and doctest. In v2026.1, we plan to revise our support for these frameworks and update it where necessary – for example, by adding support for the latest framework features or removing obsolete ones.\nWe also plan to make unit test integration independent of the CMake project format. This will allow other project formats, like Meson (CPP-35147) or the JSON compilation database, to utilize the comprehensive test functionality that is currently available only for CMake projects.\nBuild tools and project formats\nHere, we’ll focus on enhancing Bazel support with new tools, optimizing the CLion update process, and expanding code insight capabilities for complex embedded projects.\nBazel support improvements\nLast year, we took over the development of the Bazel for CLion plugin from Google and have since continued to improve its stability and user experience. For the upcoming release, we plan to add support for several new Bazel features and tools, including:\nStarlark REPL: Bazel includes an official read-eval-print loop (REPL) for the Starlark language, allowing you to explore its semantics. We plan to bundle the REPL and offer a dedicated, interactive shell session directly within the IDE, facilitating easy experimentation with Starlark.\nExeclog parser: Bazel’s build execution logs, for example, generated by using \nthe --execution_log_compact_file flag, are a valuable resource for advanced build analysis and debugging performance issues. We’ll integrate the Bazel execution log parser, which will let you easily parse these logs and diff two log files simultaneously.\nConfiguration transitions: Transitions are a powerful Bazel feature that allows you to compile C and C++ projects for multiple architectures simultaneously. Currently, our plugin only supports the default configuration. If your project uses configuration transitions, the plugin ignores them, and it’s not possible to see code insight for different configurations. We plan to add full support for transitions so you can get accurate code insight for all configurations in your project.\nPerformance improvements: We continually work to enhance the plugin’s performance and will make related updates in v2026.1. One example is the header cache, which is used for headers generated during the build process or those from virtual include paths. This cache stores headers in a format optimized for CLion, improving overall performance.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, our plugin is already compatible with Bazel 9.\nFor more details on recent Bazel updates and announcements, check out our BazelCon 2025 recap.\nAccelerating CLion updates on Windows\nSome Windows users have reported that CLion updates take too long. To address this, we plan to remove unnecessary components and optimize packaging in the installer. This will reduce the installer size and speed up the updates for Windows and other supported operating systems.\nConfiguration profiles for West projects\nWe plan to add the ability to create configuration profiles for West projects, similar to CMake profiles (CPP-42799). This will streamline working with multiple build configurations that use different build parameters or target different boards, making it easy to switch between configurations on the fly.\nCode insight features for external projects\nProjects in popular embedded frameworks, such as West, STM32, and ESP-IDF, are often divided into multiple parts. Some of these parts may be external projects with respect to the primary project. These external projects are listed in the CMake ExternalProject_Add() section. For example, in a dual-core setup, one application acts as the primary application (a primary project), while the other one runs on the coprocessor and is responsible only for communication (an external project). Similarly, when using Arm® TrustZone® technology or a bootloader, one application may have elevated privileges, while the other retains regular privileges. An external project may also contain system dependencies used only for building.\nThese external projects would benefit from having the same code insight features as the primary project, such as error detection, warnings, search for usages, and refactoring. Currently, this is only possible if you load an external project as a separate project model, which can be unnecessary or cumbersome in many cases.\nWe want to generate a compile_commands.json file from an external project’s CMake configuration. This will enable you to load the external project as part of the primary CMake project and access code insight features, making it more convenient to work with complex, multi-part projects.\nUnbundling Cygwin\nWe plan to remove the pre-defined Cygwin setup from our list of default CLion toolchains and release it as a separate plugin. This plugin will be available to download from JetBrains Marketplace. There are two main reasons behind this decision:\nThe very low number of users.\nThe uncertainty of the Cygwin project’s future, especially since WSL can replace Cygwin in most cases.\n\n\n\n\nIf you use Cygwin in CLion and have concerns about this change, please comment below or contact our Support team. We’ll do our best to help you find a suitable solution.\nEmbedded development\nMost improvements in embedded development support will be related to live watches and debug servers.\nUpdates to live watches\nIn the latest release, live watches received several UX improvements, including the ability to export data in CSV format and view peripheral register values. For the upcoming release, we’ll continue refining the feature and fixing reported issues. To learn more about live watches, see our documentation.\nOpenOCD debug server\nWe’ve developed dedicated debug servers for different projects, such as STM32CubeMX and ESP-IDF, but not yet for OpenOCD. Although OpenOCD users can still use a generic debug server, this isn’t optimal. In the next release, we plan to add a dedicated debug server for OpenOCD, making it even more convenient to create and manage debug configurations for different targets.\nDebugger\nIn the last release, we introduced support for the Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP). This feature allows you to work with third-party debuggers that use DAP, expanding your options beyond LLDB and GDB.\nImproving the DAP integration will be our main priority in the debugger updates. We plan to address reported issues and add the ability to communicate with DAP servers via a TCP port (CPP-46675).\nConclusion\nThe Early Access Program is just around the corner and will give you the chance to try all of the new features planned for the next major release for free. In the meantime, upgrade to CLion 2025.3 if you haven’t already done so, and let us know what you think!\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.3",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Previously in this series:\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 1: A Minimal Coding Agent\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 2: A Deeper Dive Into Tools\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 3: Under Observation\nIn the previous installment, we saw how to set up tracing, which brings us to two new questions: What should we experiment with based on the information this tool provides? And what parts of our agent could we improve using its observations?\nThe first idea we had was to experiment with sub-agents, or more specifically, a find sub-agent. This will give us a chance to have a look at how Koog makes it easier to implement common patterns like sub-agents. Our hypothesis is that a find sub-agent might reduce overall cost while maintaining, or even improving, performance.\nWhy would we think that? Well, the main driver of cost is context growth. Each LLM request contains the full context from start to finish, which means each subsequent request is more expensive (at least in terms of input tokens) than the previous one. If we could limit context growth, especially early in the agent’s run, we might significantly reduce cost. An unnecessarily large context could also distract the agent from its core task. Therefore, by narrowing the context, we might even see a performance improvement, though that’s harder to predict.\nThe find functionality is particularly suited for removal from the long-term context. When searching for something, you typically open many files that don’t contain your target. Remembering those dead ends isn’t useful. Remembering what you actually found is. You could think of this as a natural way of compressing the agent’s history (we’ll look at actual compression in a later article).\nThis task is also a good candidate for a sub-agent because it’s relatively simple. That simplicity means we could also make use of the sub-agent’s ability to use a different LLM model. In this case, a faster and cheaper one. This offers flexibility that regular compression doesn’t.\nOf course, we could have built a traditional procedural tool to do this. In fact, we did build one called RegexSearchTool, but for the purposes of this experiment, we put it inside the find agent rather than directly in the main agent. This approach provides us with flexibility in terms of model choice while also incorporating an extra layer of intelligence.\nThe find agent\nTo be able to have a sub-agent pattern, we first need a second agent. We’ve already covered agent creation in depth in Part 1 of the series, so we won’t spend much time on this now. However, a few details are still worth noting.\nFirst, a minor point: We’re using GPT4.1 Mini for this sub-agent because its task is much simpler and doesn’t require a model as capable as the one used by the main agent.\nSecond, it’s useful to look at which tools this agent can access. Like the main agent, it has access to the ListDirectoryTool and ReadFileTool, but not the EditFileTool or ExecuteShellCommandTool. We’ve also given it access to the new procedural search tool we mentioned above, RegexSearchTool, which allows us to search a comprehensive range of files inside a folder and its subfolders using a regex pattern.\nToolRegistry {\n    tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n    tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n    tool(RegexSearchTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n}\nFor more detailed information, check out the full implementation here.\nBuilding a find sub-agent\n\n\n\n\nFirst things first – what is a sub-agent? A sub-agent is really quite simple; it is an agent that is being controlled by another agent. In this specific case, we are working with the agent-as-a-tool sub-agent pattern, where the sub-agent is running inside a tool that is provided to the main agent.\nCreating a sub-agent turns out to be straightforward. We know a tool is essentially a function paired with descriptors that the agent can read to understand when and how to call it. We could simply define a tool whose .execute() function calls our sub-agent. But Koog provides tools to remove even this boilerplate:\nfun createFindAgentTool(): Tool<*, *> {\n    return AIAgentService\n        .fromAgent(findAgent as GraphAIAgent<String, String>)\n        .createAgentTool<String, String>(\n            agentName = \"__find_in_codebase_agent__\",\n            agentDescription = \"\"\"\n                <when to call your agent>\n            \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n            inputDescription = \"\"\"\n                <how to call your agent>\n            \"\"\".trimIndent()\n        )\n}\nYou could think of this as roughly equivalent to:\npublic class FindAgentTool(): Tool<FindAgentTool.Args, FindAgentTool.Result>() {\n   override val name: String = \"__find_in_codebase_agent__\"\n   override val description: String = \"\"\"\n      <when to call your agent>\n   \"\"\"\n   @Serializable\n   public data class Args(\n      @property: LLMDescription(\n         \"\"\"\n            <how to call your agent>\n         \"\"\"\n      )\n      val input: String\n   )\n   @Serializable\n   public data class Result(\n\tval output: String\n   )\n   override suspend fun execute(args: Args): Result = when {\n      output = findAgent.run(args.input)\n      Result(output)\n   }\n}\nIn either case, the only things we need to do are: \nCreate our sub-agent.\nGive it an agentName.\nSpecify when to call the agent through the agentDescription prompt.\nSpecify how to call the agent through the inputDescription prompt.\nThe prompts are, perhaps, the trickiest part. There’s plenty of room for fine-tuning. But there’s some indication that newer LLMs need less precisely tuned prompts, so perfectly fine-tuned prompts may not be worth our time. We’re still exploring this topic ourselves, and it will take more experimentation to really come to a strong conclusion.\nOne thing we did notice is that, if we’re not careful with the prompts, the main agent sometimes confuses the find agent with a simple Ctrl+F / ⌘F function, sending only the tokens it wants to search for. That’s clearly suboptimal. With so little context, the find agent can’t reason about what it should actually be looking for. To address this, we include instructions requiring the main agent to specify why it’s looking for something. That way, the find agent can fully leverage its intelligence to find the actual thing the main agent is looking for.\n\"\"\"\nThis tool is powered by an intelligent micro agent that analyzes and understands code context to find specific elements in your codebase.\nUnlike simple text search (Ctrl+F / ⌘F), it intelligently interprets your query to locate classes, functions, variables, or files that best match your intent.\nIt requires a detailed query describing what to search for, why you need this information, and an absolute path defining the search scope.\n...\n\"\"\"\n\nQuery WITH highlighting (not Ctrl+F /⌘F)Query WITHOUT highlighting (not Ctrl+F /⌘F)\n\nSearch for changes in get_search_results regarding unnecessary joins to see if there are comment or logic on unnecessary joins.get_search_results\nSearch for environment variable usage with SKLEARN_ALLOW or similar in repository to find potential bypass of check_build.SKLEARN_ALLOW\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also noticed that the main agent sometimes still chooses to call the shell tool with a grep command instead of the find agent, which undermines the entire purpose of having a dedicated sub-agent. To avoid this pattern, we added this section to the main system prompt in order to push it harder:\n\"\"\"\n...\nYou also have an intelligent find micro agent at your disposal,\nwhich can help you find code components and other constructs more\ncheaply than you can yourself. Lean on it for any and all\nsearch operations. Do not use shell execution for find tasks.\n...\n\"\"\"\nWe also took some lessons from years of IDE development. When you search in your IDE, you don’t just get file paths and line numbers. You get snippets of the code around each match. This helps you quickly determine whether that’s actually what you were looking for without opening every file.\nWe wanted to create a similar experience for the main agent, which is why we prompt the find sub-agent to include snippets in its results:\n\"\"\"\n...\nPrioritize accuracy and relevance in your search results.\n* For each result, provide a clear and concise explanation of why it was selected.\n* The explanation should state the specific criteria that led to its selection.\n* If the match is partial or inferred, clearly state the limitations and potential inaccuracies.\n* Include only relevant snippets in the results.\n...\nThis way, the main agent gets the same rich context we get as engineers, without needing to read through entire files just to verify it found the right thing.\nThis is the “natural compression” we mentioned in the opening. The find agent opens many files, follows dead ends, and explores the codebase. But the main agent only sees the results: relevant file paths, snippets, and explanations. All that exploration stays in the find agent’s context and disappears after it returns. Only the stuff that really mattered is then added to the main agent’s context.\nThe trade-offs\nUsing a sub-agent has its benefits, but it also has downsides. This is certainly the kind of change that warrants experimentation to show whether it delivers the benefits we’re hoping for without too many sacrifices.\nThe first trade-off is cost and time. While shortening the context in the main thread helps bring down the cost and time there, we now also have to pay and wait for a number of LLM calls in the sub-agent. The hope is that the total cost and time spent are less, but that depends on how the main agent uses the sub-agent. If it ends up doing a large number of small queries, that benefit might not materialize. We will look at the costs when we run the benchmarks again in a later section, and we will just assume that cost and time are correlated.\nWe did notice this happening in some of our runs, so we added a segment to the tool’s agentDescription that explains the issue to the main agent and tries to limit the frequency of such high volumes of small queries:\n\"\"\"\n...\nWhile this agent is much more cost efficient at executing searches than using shell commands, it does lose context in between searches. So give preference to clustering similar searches in one call rather than doing multiple calls to this tool.\n...\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\nA second trade-off is that this approach treats context retention in a far more black-and-white way than humans do. We may not pull everything that happened in the past into active memory, but we do keep vague impressions of what happened and can retrieve additional context when needed. There are ways to model this kind of behavior, but they are far beyond the scope of the current iteration of our agent and are more related to the deep and complex subject of agentic memory.\nAnother challenge is that it creates more complexity in tracing. In Langfuse, we no longer only have to look at the trace of just one agent. Indeed, we might even need to look at the behavior from multiple perspectives – both the full view and each agent separately.\nThink wider: The engineering team analogy\nThis technique of using sub-agents isn’t limited to simple cases like the find agent. You could, for example, replicate the separation of concerns in team structures by assigning analysis, implementation, testing, and planning to different sub-agents. \nIt’s still an open question whether an agent with all these capabilities does better or worse than a system where such capabilities are divided among sub-agents, but it’s not hard to imagine potential benefits. Think of Conway’s law: “Organizations design systems that mirror their communication structure.” One interpretation is that these communication structures evolved to discover efficient patterns worth keeping. The reverse Conway maneuver even suggests this is desirable.\nCould the same be true for role distribution? Maybe the division of tasks across different specializations in software teams also evolved to discover efficient ways of working. Maybe LLMs could benefit from that, too.\nYet this is not guaranteed. The efficiencies might stem largely from spreading the human learning processes, and this might not apply to LLMs. But in the book Clean Code, we read about wearing different hats: a writer hat (creator), a reader hat (maintainer), and a tester hat (tester). The idea is to focus on one role without being distracted by the perspectives of the others. This suggests task division goes deeper than just learning efficiency, meaning it might indeed be relevant to LLMs.\n\n\n\n\nAll of this is to say that you can take sub-agents a lot further, but whether this is a beneficial approach is still unproven. It’s still an art form for now, not a hard science.\nBenchmark results: Testing the hypothesis\nWe’re happy to report that our version without the find sub-agent shows a cost of about $814, or $1.63 per instance, while our version with this sub-agent shows a cost of about $733, or $1.47 per instance. That’s a 10% cost saving, which is definitely worth noting.\nOne interesting observation is how strongly the results depend on the choice of LLM for the sub-agent. In a smaller experiment, we tried keeping our sub-agent connected to GPT-5 Codex, and that dramatically increased the cost to $3.30 per example, averaged over 50 examples.\n\nExperimentSuccess rateCost per instance\nPart 03 (Langfuse)56% (278/500)$1.63 ($814/500)\nPart 04 (sub-agent GPT4.1 mini)58% (290/500)$1.47 ($733/500) \nPart 04 (sub-agent GPT-5 Codex)58% (29/50)$3.30 ($165/50)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, it is interesting to note that we hypothesized two ways to reduce cost. The first was shrinking the context size through the natural compression achieved by task handoffs, and the second was offloading work to a cheaper model. The data suggests that just splitting off a sub-agent (and keeping the GPT-5 Codex model) actually increases the cost significantly, so our first method doesn’t seem to work, while our second (cheaper models) is the one that seems to do the trick – though this may not be rigorous proof.\nAs for performance improvements, we see a small uptick from 56% to 58%. This could be within the tolerance of statistical variance, but it’s encouraging that performance at least stayed consistent while we reduced costs.\nConclusion\nWe’ve seen that creating sub-agents is both simple and potentially powerful. Koog provides convenient tooling to streamline the process even further, leaving only the prompts for the agent-as-a-tool for you to define.\nThis technique clearly delivers worthwhile cost savings. We achieved nearly a 10% reduction – a clear, measurable improvement. The performance impact is less clear, but it does look like it might be some gains there, too.\nAt the same time, these kinds of evaluations are expensive. Even with reduced costs, this benchmark still totaled $730. That’s why, in the next part, we will take a closer look at another strategy for lowering costs: a more general approach to compression. In it, we’ll answer the question, “How do you prevent your context from growing indefinitely, and your costs growing with it?”",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Damaso Sanoja, draft.dev.\nIf you’re spending your mornings debugging Jenkins pipeline failures, waiting for builds that should take minutes but stretch into hours, or scrambling to identify which plugin update broke your deployment process, you’re not alone. These daily troubleshooting battles with legacy CI/CD systems drain engineering time that could be spent building features and delivering value.\nTeamCity’s built-in health signals help you address these everyday struggles head-on by surfacing the root causes of your pipeline problems before they escalate. Instead of hunting through logs to understand why builds fail, you get clear visibility into success rates, build duration trends, and bottleneck identification. When issues arise, comprehensive test reporting and failure analysis help you pinpoint what broke and why, turning hours of detective work into minutes of targeted fixes.\nIn this article, you’ll learn how TeamCity’s monitoring and diagnostic capabilities give you the insights needed to maintain stable and fast pipelines and spend more time on what matters most – shipping quality software.\nEnsuring stability and quality in every release\nConsistently shipping stable, high-quality code is non-negotiable; unstable releases undermine customer trust, inflate support costs, and create compounding technical debt. But how do you know your pipeline is stable and which levers improve quality?\nTeamCity’s Statistics Charts offer precise answers that translate complexity into clarity.\nMonitor success rates for continuous stability\nSuccess rate is an important metric of any CI/CD: It tracks the percentage of passing builds over time, spotlighting trends and sudden changes.\nHigh success rates indicate predictable pipelines and effective feedback loops, while dips signal fragility, demanding immediate attention.\n\n\n\n\nVisualize test failures to diagnose quality risks\nFailure rates provide additional insight: While the success rate gives you a pass/fail snapshot, overlaying failed test counts helps pinpoint when and how systemic issues emerge, revealing what releases are more problematic.\nIn the same Statistics tab, toggle Show failed in the Test Count graph to make test failures visible.\n\n\n\n\nAccess high-level failure data in seconds\nRapidly spotting patterns, like back-to-back failures, allows for proactive fixes before technical debt accumulates.\nUse the Overview tab for a high-level summary of all builds for a project, listed with their statuses, durations, changes, and failure indicators.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigate failures with one click\nClick into any build for detailed information regarding the status of every step, their duration, code-inspection results, changes in the code, and more:\n\n\n\n\nFollow the evidence: Click the Tests tab to get the full breakdown of which tests failed, whether they’re new or recurring, and contextual details that guide targeted fixes:\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Tests tab, you can drill deeper into individual test behavior by accessing the test history page. Click the three-dot menu to the right of any test name to open this view, which reveals patterns in test failures, such as how frequently the test fails, which build agents experience issues, when failures began, and trends over time. This historical perspective helps you distinguish between flaky tests and genuine regressions, making it easier to prioritize fixes based on impact and recurrence.\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the feedback loop, the Build Log offers a searchable, chronological trace of every step for uncovering underlying errors and misconfigurations behind failed tests.\n\n\n\n\nFrom failures to code quality: Tracking what matters\nAfter tracing a failure, comprehensive quality assurance means going beyond green builds to deep code insights. TeamCity’s Statistics tab offers dedicated charts for Code Inspections and Code Coverage to track technical debt and ensure essential logic is tested. You can also extend TeamCity’s dashboard by adding custom tabs with your own reports to the build results interface, enabling you to incorporate specialized metrics and third-party analysis tools directly into your workflow.\n\n\n\n\nClicking any point in the Code Coverage chart brings you to that build’s Coverage tab. Depending on your configured tool (in this example, coverage.py), you’ll find granular coverage reports here. These insights clarify which parts of your codebase are thoroughly tested versus those at risk of silent failure.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding where failures occur and which code remains untested raises quality, shortens feedback loops, and reduces risk for every subsequent release.\nAccelerating delivery: Measuring and improving release velocity\nOnce stability and quality are established, the next challenge for any engineering team is maximizing how quickly new value reaches users.\nTeamCity’s analytic charts and dashboards surface velocity as a multidimensional flow to help you drive meaningful gains in delivery speed without sacrificing rigor. You can enhance these analytics by reporting custom statistic values using TeamCity service messages directly from your build steps, allowing you to track metrics like code coverage percentages, inspection results, and other team-specific indicators alongside TeamCity’s built-in measurements.\nMonitoring release cadence for continuous value delivery\nEvery successful production release puts features, fixes, and security improvements directly into the hands of customers. That’s why tracking how often your CI/CD pipeline ships code is a critical health signal for agility and operational efficiency.\nFrequent deployments mean smaller, safer changes and less risk per release.\nTeamCity charts like Time Spent in Queue and Build Times help you identify when and how production deployments occur to quickly spot accelerations or slowdowns in delivery cadence.\n\n\n\n\nShortening cycle time for a faster feedback loop\nSpeed isn’t just about shipping more often; it’s also about reducing the interval between code commit and user impact. This end-to-end cycle time is an important health signal that defines your delivery pipeline’s efficiency and how quickly improvements make it to production.\nTeamCity’s flexibility allows for custom charts that highlight patterns in end-to-end delivery duration. For instance, you can build an Average Deployment Time graph using the Starting Build on Agent and Finishing Build on Server metrics:\n\n\n\n\nImproving failure response time to minimize impact\nThe speed at which your team responds to and recovers from production failures is a pivotal indicator of both resilience and operational maturity. TeamCity’s Time to Fix Tests and detailed build duration analytics show you how quickly errors surface and get resolved so you can quantify the impact of failures and how effectively you recover.\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring build duration for sustainable velocity\nVelocity also depends on how little time is wasted in each cycle. Analyzing Build Times and Build Duration by Stage reveals how efficiently your pipeline processes changes to help you maintain momentum and ensure timely deployments.\n\n\n\n\nDiagnosing bottlenecks: Pinpointing and resolving pipeline inefficiencies\nWhile fast delivery accelerates value, a truly effective pipeline depends on quickly surfacing and eliminating waste before slowdowns become systemic. Efficiently diagnosing bottlenecks prevents frustration, boosts developer productivity, and ensures that each iteration is an opportunity for improvement, not an exercise in firefighting.\nTeamCity’s analytics transform this process from guesswork into surgical, data-driven action.\nSpotting build spikes with actionable trends\nAnalyzing build duration trends is one of the most effective ways to identify pipeline inefficiencies. A sudden spike on the Build Times chart instantly highlights a potential issue, whether due to environmental issues, unusually long tests, or integration problems.\nFor example, you can use the Build Duration by Stage custom chart to pinpoint where in the pipeline bottlenecks occur as soon as unusual patterns emerge.\n\n\n\n\nInvestigating test duration: Finding the crawl in your pipeline\nLong build times can often be traced back to problematic tests. You can use the Tests tab in any build to check on the status, name, and duration of every test.\n\n\n\n\nIf the test duration is abnormally high, you can click on it for a historical trend chart that lets you identify when the test began slowing down and in what context.\n\n\n\n\nSimply click on any test to mute it or assign ownership for further investigation, ensuring accountability and rapid feedback.\n\n\n\n\nDetecting and managing flaky tests automatically\nFlaky tests (those that fail unpredictably) can silently degrade confidence in your pipeline and are notoriously difficult to spot through duration analysis alone.\nTeamCity proactively flags flaky tests and surfaces them in the dedicated Flaky Tests tab at the project level. Here, you see the test name, failure count, flip rate, and insights into the causes for flakiness that you can act on.\n\n\n\n\nFlaky tests are also prominently flagged in the Overview code inspection section for any failed build. Click into the test entry for a detailed stack trace, or open the error in the Build Log for a deeper dive.\n\n\n\n\nUsing test reports for root-cause analysis\nAlong with flaky test management, TeamCity’s Tests tab flags these problematic tests and offers a Test History report on clicking. These reports let you compare failure patterns across builds by listing status, duration, build number, changes, agent, and precise timestamps side by side. Additionally, an intuitive history chart enables quick trend analysis.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nMoving beyond the daily cycle of troubleshooting builds requires more than patch fixes and workarounds. TeamCity provides the diagnostic clarity you need with built-in health signals that reveal build duration trends, success rate patterns, and failure root causes – without having to dive through endless plugin configurations or log files.\nInstead of spending hours investigating why builds randomly fail or trying to identify which plugin update broke your deployment chain, TeamCity’s comprehensive monitoring gives you immediate visibility into pipeline bottlenecks and stability issues. The integrated test reporting eliminates guesswork so you can pinpoint problems quickly and maintain consistent delivery performance.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from John Arundel, a Go writer and teacher who runs a free email course for Go learners. His book The Power of Go: Tests is a love letter to test-driven development in Go.\n“Fred Astaire? Sure, he was great, but don’t forget Ginger Rogers did everything he did… backwards, and in high heels.”\n\n            \nBob Thaves\n                                                        \nHave you ever tried programming backwards? If not, you’re in for a treat! You won’t even need to wear high heels.\n(If you want to, though, go for it—you’ll look fabulous!)\nThe function that never was\nSuppose we want to write a Go function that checks whether a given slice is sorted (that is, its elements are in order).\nFor example, if the input is {1, 2, 3}, the answer should be true, because the slice is sorted. On the other hand, if the input is {3, 1, 2}, we should get false, because the slice is not sorted.\nMost people would probably start writing some function IsSorted. That’s fine for Fred Astaire. Just for fun, though, shall we try tackling this problem backwards, like Ginger Rogers?\nWe’ll start by imagining that we already have the IsSorted function, and we’ll try to write a test for it. Once we have the test, we’ll go on to write the function.Let’s fire up GoLand and select File / New / Project… / sorted.\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll use New / Go File to create a source file, and name it sorted_test.go.\nWe’ll start by declaring:\npackage sorted_test\nAll Go tests have the same signature, so the test snippet saves us writing it. We’ll type test, and press Tab to complete:\nfunc TestName(t *testing.T) {\n\n}\nWe’re invited to replace Name with a description of the behavior to test. How about:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlice(t *testing.T) {\n\n}\nSounds believable, so let’s fill in the rest:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlice(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    input := []int{1, 2, 3}\n    if !sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n        t.Errorf(\"got false for %v\", input)\n    }\n}\nIf the result of calling IsSorted on this input is false, the test fails. Straightforward!\nThe fastest route to failure\nWe know IsSorted doesn’t exist yet, but before we implement it, we need to know if this test will actually detect bugs in IsSorted. That’s what tests are for, after all.\nLet’s write as little code as we possibly can to get this test compiling and failing. The first problem GoLand tells us about is “Unresolved reference sorted”. Fair enough!\nWe need to create the sorted package, so let’s set up another new file: New / Go File / sorted.go.\nNow we have a quick-fix action available in the test: import sorted. Great!\n\n\n\n\nWe still have an unresolved reference IsSorted, but now we can use the quick fix Create Function IsSorted. Here’s the result:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n\n}\nGood start, but now GoLand says “Missing the return statement at end of function.” Here’s the quick fix: Add return statement.\n\n\n\n\nNow we have:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    return\n}\nAlmost there, but now we have the error “not enough arguments to return.” Quick fix again: Add missing return values.\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    return false\n}\n“But this won’t work!” I hear you wail. “It always returns false no matter what the input!”\nYour wailing is on point, dear reader, but remember, we want a non-working implementation, and now we have one. This is the perfect time to check if our test will actually detect a bug in IsSorted—for instance, that it always returns false!\nLet’s click the green triangle next to the test name to run the test. We assume it will fail, but you never know—that’s why we check:\nsorted_test.go:12: got false for [1 2 3]\n--- FAIL: TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlice (0.00s)\n\n\n\n\nSuccess! (I said this was backwards.)\n\n\n\n\nCranking up the difficulty\nWe could trivially change IsSorted to return true instead of false to make this pass, but that doesn’t really get us anywhere. IsSorted needs to be able to distinguish between sorted and unsorted slices, not just return a fixed value.\nWe want two tests, for two different behaviours: that IsSorted is true for sorted inputs, and that it’s false for unsorted ones.\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlice(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    input := []int{1, 2, 3}\n    if !sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n        t.Errorf(\"got false for %v\", input)\n    }\n}\n\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsFalseForUnsortedSlice(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    input := []int{1, 3, 2}\n    if sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n        t.Errorf(\"got true for %v\", input)\n    }\n}\nA fixed-value implementation could pass one test or the other, but not both. Let’s prove it, using the Ctrl-Shift-R shortcut to run all tests in this file:\n\n\n\n\nHow little work do you think we can do to get both tests passing?\nBaby’s first steps\nIf any elements are not in order, then at some point we’ll encounter a number that’s smaller than the previous one. The simplest, dumbest way I can think of to detect that is:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    prev := 0\n    for _, v := range input {\n        if v < prev {\n            return false\n        }\n    }\n    return true\n}\nIt seems reasonable, but I could stare at this code all day and not be sure whether it’s correct or not. Let’s check:\n=== FAIL:  TestIsSorted_IsFalseForUnsortedSlice\n    sorted_test.go:20: got true for [1 3 2]\n\n\n\n\nOops. I forgot to update prev with each new number (not enough coffee today). Let’s add a prev = v to the loop:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    prev := 0\n    for _, v := range input {\n        if v < prev {\n            return false\n        }\n        prev = v\n    }\n    return true\n}\nThis passes both tests now, but is it really correct? Again, we could have a staring contest with this code looking for bugs, and we might find some, or we might not.\n\n\n\n\nThe backwards programmer’s approach, though, is to stare at the tests instead. Can we think of some more test cases that might trip up a buggy implementation of IsSorted?\nWhat about a slice that contains repeated numbers, for example?\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSliceWithRepeat(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    input := []int{1, 2, 2}\n    if !sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n        t.Errorf(\"got false for %v\", input)\n    }\n}\nThis passes, which is encouraging. But I notice that the test logic is the same for all our “sorted” tests, so let’s combine them into a single table test.\n\n\n\n\nCases on the table\nGoLand can write this table test for us, if we right-click on the IsSorted function and select Generate / Test for function:\nfunc TestIsSorted(t *testing.T) {\n    type args struct {\n        input []int\n    }\n    tests := []struct {\n        name string\n        args args\n        want bool\n    }{\n        // TODO: Add test cases.\n    }\n    for _, tt := range tests {\n        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            if got := sorted.IsSorted(tt.args.input); got != tt.want {\n                t.Errorf(\"IsSorted() = %v, want %v\", got, tt.want)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\nNot bad, but this generated code is just a suggestion: we don’t have to follow it slavishly. Let’s make a few small tweaks:\nWe’ll run the test in parallel\nWe’ll organise the test cases as a map, keyed by name\nWe don’t need to specify want every time, because it’s always true in this test\nSo:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlicesWith(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    inputs := map[string][]int{\n        \"all elements different\": {1, 2, 3},\n        \"repeated elements\":      {1, 2, 2},\n    }\n    for name, input := range inputs {\n        t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            if !sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n                t.Errorf(\"got false for %v\", input)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\nUsing t.Run turns each case into a named subtest, and all our subtests can share the same function body, which simplifies things.\n\n\n\n\nThis replaces the two old IsTrue tests, so now let’s add another table test for IsFalse:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsFalseForUnsortedSlicesWith(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    inputs := map[string][]int{\n        \"all elements different\": {1, 3, 2},\n        \"repeated elements\":      {3, 2, 2},\n    }\n    for name, input := range inputs {\n        t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {\n            if sorted.IsSorted(input) {\n                t.Errorf(\"got true for %v\", input)\n            }\n        })\n    }\n}\nLooking good. Time for a well-earned break, I think. Would you care for some tea and cake?\nDon’t be so negative!\nWhile I was nibbling at a moist, fudgy chocolate brownie just now, I thought: prev starts at zero, but what if the first element is negative? Then we’d wrongly return false for a sorted slice, because v < prev. Yikes!\nYour conventional programmer—Fred Astaire, if you like—would jump straight into fixing IsSorted. But we’re backwards programmers, so we’ll use the Ginger Rogers technique: first write a failing test, then make it pass.\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlicesWith(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    inputs := map[string][]int{\n        \"all elements different\": {1, 2, 3},\n        \"repeated elements\":      {1, 2, 2},\n        \"negative first element\": {-1, 2, 3},\n    }\n    ...\nThis fails as expected:\n\n\n\n\nNow we can fix it. Let’s initialize prev to the first element of input and then loop over the remaining elements:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    prev := input[0]\n    for _, v := range input[1:] {\n        if v < prev {\n            return false\n        }\n        prev = v\n    }\n    return true\n}\nAnd:\n\n\n\n\nOh glory be, oh happy day! We can ship the package to production and go out for our team pizza night (extra pepperoni on mine, please).\nLater that same week…\nWell, everything was fine for a few days, but then a bug report came in from a customer: IsSorted panicked when they called it with an empty slice (oh dear).\nWell, we can fix this—backwards! Let’s add the customer’s “no elements” test case to our table:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlicesWith(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    inputs := map[string][]int{\n        \"all elements different\": {1, 2, 3},\n        \"repeated elements\":      {1, 2, 2},\n        \"negative first element\": {-1, 2, 3},\n        \"no elements\":            {},\n    }\n    ...\nThis should reproduce the bug report:\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’ll locate the panic using the stack trace:\nsorted.IsSorted(...)\n    /yumyum/cake/yesplease/sorted/sorted.go:4\nThis is a link, so clicking the filename teleports us straight to the offending line:\nprev := input[0]\nAn empty slice has no elements, hence the panic. But it is sorted, so we can simply return true straight away in this case:\nif len(input) == 0 {\n    return true\n}\n\n\n\n\nAnd while we’re here, let’s handle a one-element slice the same way. New test case:\nfunc TestIsSorted_IsTrueForSortedSlicesWith(t *testing.T) {\n    t.Parallel()\n    inputs := map[string][]int{\n        \"all elements different\": {1, 2, 3},\n        \"repeated elements\":      {1, 2, 2},\n        \"negative first element\": {-1, 2, 3},\n        \"no elements\":            {},\n        \"one element\":            {1},\n    }\n    ...\nA small tweak to the function:\nif len(input) < 2 {\n    return true\n}\nTests are passing, and customers are happy. Another win for backwards programming!\n\n\n\n\nCutting out the calories\nA little while later, a new member of the team, Alyssa, is looking at our current version of IsSorted:\nfunc IsSorted(input []int) bool {\n    if len(input) < 2 {\n        return true\n    }\n    prev := input[0]\n    for _, v := range input[1:] {\n        if v < prev {\n            return false\n        }\n        prev = v\n    }\n    return true\n}\n“You know,” she says, “there’s a function for this in the standard library. I think we could replace all this code with just…”\nreturn slices.IsSorted(input)\nHuge if true! Well, we know exactly how to find out: run the tests.\nJust for fun, let’s use the gotestdox tool, which both runs the tests and prints their names as English sentences. “Tests as docs”, if you like.\ngo run github.com/bitfield/gotestdox/cmd/gotestdox@latest\n\n\n\n\nWonderful! This is exactly the kind of radical refactoring idea we hoped you’d bring to the team, Alyssa P. Hacker. And backwards programming helped make it safe: by writing our tests first, we made sure that any new code is always covered by tests.\nThe way forward?\nSo that’s backwards programming. Once you’ve tried it, it doesn’t really seem so backwards after all, does it?\nNext time you have a feature to add or a bug to fix, then, why not try doing the backwards quickstep yourself? It’s as easy as “red, green, refactor”:\nAdd a failing test (“red”)\nMake it pass (“green”)\nTidy up, optimise, and check that all tests still pass (“refactor”)\nJust remember to always look where you’re going, and try not to trip over your own feet.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "How Airbnb rolled out 20+ locally relevant payment methods worldwide in just 14 months\nBy: Gerum Haile, Bo Shi, Yujia Liu, Yanwei Bai, Bo Yuan, Rory MacQueen, Yixia Mao\n\nAcross the more than 220 global markets that Airbnb operates in, cards are the primary way that guests pay for stays, experiences, and services. However, to help make our platform accessible to more people, reduce friction at checkout, and drive more adoption, we introduced trusted, locally preferred payment methods — called local payment methods or LPMs. By offering and supporting these payment methods, Airbnb enables guests everywhere to choose what works best for them.\nIn this blog post, we’ll discuss the implementation details behind our Pay as a Local initiative, which allowed us to launch 20+ local payment methods across multiple markets in just over one year.\nLPMs: What they are, why they matter, and our discovery and selection process\nLocal payment methods go beyond traditional cards and include:\n\nCountry or region-specific digital wallets (such as M-Pesa or MTN, MoMo)\nOnline bank transfers (such as Online Banking Czech, Online Banking Slovakia)\nReal-time or instant bank payments (such as PIX, UPI)\nLocal payment schemes (such as EFTPOS, Cartes Bancaires)\n\nBy embracing LPMs, Airbnb helps make travel more inclusive and seamless for people around the world. LPMs help the platform to:\n\nBoost conversion and bookings by offering guests familiar, trusted payment options.\nUnlock new markets where credit card usage is low or non-existent.\nBuild accessibility for guests without credit cards or traditional banking access.\n\nThrough our research on local payment methods (LPMs), we identified over 300 unique payment options worldwide. For the initial phase of the LPM initiative, we used a structured qualification framework to select which local payment methods we would support. We evaluated the top 75 travel markets and selected the top one to two payment methods per market — excluding those without a clear travel use case — and arrived at a shortlist of just over 20 LPMs best suited for integration into our payment platform.\nBackground on Airbnb’s payment platform\nAirbnb’s payments platform is designed to decouple payment logic from the core business (i.e., stays, experiences, and services), allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. The platform efficiently coordinates both guest pay-ins and host payouts by working with regulated payment service providers and financial partners.\nBeyond payment processing, the system also supports robust payment trust and compliance functions.\nModernization\nAs part of a multi-year replatforming initiative for our payments architecture called Payments LTA (long-term architecture), we shifted from a monolithic system to a capability-oriented services system structured by domains, using a domain-driven decomposition approach. This modernization approach reduced our time to market, increased reusability and extensibility, and empowered greater team autonomy.\nThe core payment domain delivers essential capabilities for pay-in, payout, and payment intermediation. It consists of multiple subdomains, including Pay-in, Payout, Transaction Fulfillment, Processing, Wallet & instruments, Ledger, Incentives & Stored Value, Issuing, and Settlement & Reconciliation.\nReplatforming as an enabler for local payment method expansion\nThe processing subdomain enables integration with third-party payment service providers (PSPs) and supports API and file-based vendor integration, as well as switching and routing capabilities. As part of our replatforming initiative, we adopted a connector and plugin-based architecture for onboarding new third-party payment service providers. This strategy has significantly reduced the time required to integrate new PSPs in different markets.\nDuring this replatforming effort, we also introduced Multi-Step Transactions (MST): a processor-agnostic framework that supports payment flows completed across multiple stages. MST defines a PSP-agnostic transaction language to describe the intermediate steps required in a payment, such as submitting supplemental data or handling dynamic interactions. These steps, called Actions, can include:\n\nRedirects\nStrong customer authentication (SCA) frictions (challenges, fingerprinting)\nPayment method — specific flows\n\nWhen a PSP indicates that an additional user action is required, its vendor plugin normalizes the request into an ActionPayload and returns it with a transaction intent status of ACTION_REQUIRED. This architecture ensures consistent handling of complex, multi-step payment experiences across diverse PSPs and markets.\n\nLPM integration architecture\nWhile our modernized payment platform laid the foundation for enabling LPMs, these payment methods come with a unique set of challenges. Many local methods require users to complete transactions in third-party wallet apps. This introduces complexity in app switching, session hand-off, and synchronization between Airbnb and external digital wallets.\nEach local payment vendor also exposes different APIs and behaviors across charge, refund, and settlement flows, making integration and standardization difficult.\nTechnical approach\nWe analyzed the end-to-end behavior of our 20+ LPMs, and identified three foundational payment flows that capture the full spectrum of user and system interactions. By distilling LPM behaviors into these standardized payment flow archetypes, we established a unified framework for integration:\n\nRedirect flow: Guests are redirected to a third-party site or app to complete the payment, then return to Airbnb to finalize their booking (e.g., Naver Pay, GoPay, FPX).\nAsync flow: Guests complete payment externally after receiving a prompt (such as a QR code or push notification), and Airbnb receives payment confirmation asynchronously via webhooks (e.g., Pix, MB Way, Blik).\nDirect flow: Guests enter their payment credentials directly within Airbnb’s interface, allowing real-time processing similar to traditional card payments (e.g., Carte Bancaires, Apple Pay).\n\nThis standardized approach has enabled significant reusability across integrations and substantially reduced the engineering effort required to support new payment methods.\nAsynchronous payment orchestration\nSince many guests complete payments through external providers, we redesigned our payment orchestration — building on top of MST — to support payment flows that require user actions outside Airbnb (redirect flows and async flows).\nFor redirect flows, where guests complete the payment on a third-party app or website:\n\nAirbnb’s payments platform sends a charge request to the local payment vendor, whose response includes a redirectUrl.\nOur platform redirects the user to the external app or website to complete the payment.\nOnce the payment is successfully completed, the user is redirected back to Airbnb with a result token. Airbnb’s payments platform then uses this token to securely confirm and finalize the payment with the local processor.\n\nFor async flows (which typically involve scanning a QR code):\n\nAirbnb’s payments platform sends a charge request to the local payment vendor, whose response includes a qrCodeData.\nThe checkout page displays the QR code for the user to scan and complete the payment in their wallet app.\nAfter the payment succeeds, the vendor sends a webhook notification to Airbnb’s payments platform, which updates the payment status to success and confirms the user’s order.\n\nNaver Pay: Redirect To Naver Pay Website\nNaver Pay is one of the fastest-growing digital payment methods in South Korea. As of early 2025, it has reached over 30.6 million active users, representing approximately 60% of the South Korean population. Enabling Naver Pay in the South Korean market not only helps deliver a more seamless and familiar payment experience for local guests, but also expands Airbnb’s reach to new users who prefer using Naver Pay as their primary payment method.\n\nPix: Scan A QR Code\nPix is an instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil, enabling 24/7 real-time money transfers through methods such as QR codes or Pix keys. Its adoption has been extraordinary — by late 2024, more than 76% of Brazil’s population was using Pix, making it the country’s most popular payment method, surpassing cash, credit, and debit cards. In 2024 alone, Pix processed over BRL 26.4 trillion (approximately USD 4.6 trillion) in transaction volume, underscoring its pivotal role in Brazil’s digital payment ecosystem.\n\nConfig-driven payment method integration\nAirbnb embraced a config-driven approach, powered by a central YAML-based Payment Method Config that acts as a single source of truth for flows, eligibility, input fields, refund rules, and more. Instead of scattering payment method logic across the frontend, backend, and various services, we consolidate all relevant details in this config. Both core payment services and frontend experiences dynamically reference this single source of truth, ensuring consistency for eligibility checks, UI rendering, and business rules. This unified approach dramatically reduces duplication, manual updates, and errors across the stack, making integration and maintenance faster and more reliable.\nThese configs also drive automated code generation for backend services using code generation tools, producing Java classes, DTOs, enums, schema, and integration scaffolding. As a result, integrating or updating a payment method is largely declarative — just a config change. This streamlines launches from months to weeks and makes ongoing maintenance far simpler.\n\nPayment widget\nOur payment widget — the payment method UI embedded into the checkout page — includes the list of available payment methods and handles the user’s inputs. Local payment methods often require specialized input forms (such as CPF for Pix) and have unique country/currency eligibility.\nRather than hardcoding forms and rules into the client, we centralize both form-field specification and eligibility checks in the backend. Servers send configuration payloads to clients defining exactly which fields to collect, which validation rules to apply, and which payment options to render. This empowers the frontend to dynamically adapt UI and validation for each payment method, accelerating launches and keeping user experiences fresh without frequent client releases.\nFor example, Pix in Brazil requires the guest’s first name, last name, and CPF (tax ID), which we collect and transmit as required to complete the payment.\n\nBelow is a diagram illustrating how dynamic payment method configurations are delivered from the backend to the frontend, enabling tailored checkout presentations for each payment method.\n\nBuilding confidence through better testability\nTesting local payment methods can be difficult, because developers often don’t have access to local wallets. Yet with such a broad range of payment methods and complex flows, comprehensive testing is essential to prevent regressions and ensure seamless functionality.\nTo address this, we enhanced Airbnb’s in-house Payment Service Provider (PSP) Emulator, enabling realistic simulation of PSP interactions for both redirect and asynchronous payment methods. The Emulator allows developers to test end-to-end payment scenarios without relying on unstable (or nonexistent) PSP sandboxes. For redirect payments, the Emulator provides a simple UI mirroring PSP acquirer pages, allowing testers to explicitly approve or decline transactions for precise scenario control. For async methods, it returns QR code details and automatically schedules webhook emission tasks upon receiving a /payments request — delivering a complete, reliable testing environment across diverse LPMs.\n\nScaling observability for local payment methods\nMaintaining high reliability and availability is critical for Airbnb’s global payment system. As we expand to support many new local payment methods, we face increasing complexity: greater dependencies on external PSPs and wide variations in payment behaviors. For example, a real-time card payment and a redirect flow like Naver Pay follow completely different technical paths. That diversity makes observability difficult — a single “payment success rate” may represent card health well, but say little about an asynchronous LPM. Without proper visibility, regressions can go unnoticed until they affect real users. As dozens of new LPMs go live, observability has become the foundation of reliability.\nTo address this, we built a centralized monitoring framework that unifies metrics across all layers, from client to PSP. When launching a new LPM, onboarding now requires a single config change; add the method name, and metrics begin streaming automatically:\n\nClient metrics — user-level flow health from clients\nPayment backend metrics — API-level metrics for payment flows\nPSP metrics — API-level visibility between Airbnb and the PSP\nWebhook metrics — async completion status for redirect methods or refunds\n\nWe have also standardized the alerting rules across our platform’s Client, Backend, PSP, and Webhook layers using composite alerts and anomaly detection. Each alert follows a consistent pattern (failure count, rate, time window), e.g., “Naver Pay resume failures > 5 and failure rate > 20% in 30 minutes.” This design minimizes false positives during low-traffic periods.\nThis framework scales effectively, providing end-to-end visibility from user click to PSP confirmation. It enables engineers to trace issues in minutes rather than hours, whether those issues were caused by internal changes or external outages. By turning observability into a shared, automated layer, we were able to strengthen the backbone of payment reliability while accelerating the rollout of new LPMs worldwide.\nImpact\nThe Pay as a Local initiative delivered significant business and technical impact:\n\nMeaningful booking uplift: We observed meaningful uplift in bookings and new users in markets where we launched local payment methods\nFaster integrations: Reduced integration time significantly through reusable flows and config-driven automation.\nStronger reliability: Improved observability for early outage detection, standardized testing to prevent regressions, and streamlined vendor escalation and on-call processes for global resilience.\n\nConclusion\nSupporting local payment methods helps Airbnb to stay competitive and relevant in the global travel industry. These payment options help improve checkout conversion, drive adoption, and unlock new growth opportunities.\nThis post outlined how the Airbnb payment platform has evolved to support local payment methods at scale — through asynchronous payment orchestration, config-driven onboarding, centralized observability, and robust testability. Together, these capabilities enable faster integrations, lower maintenance overhead, and offer a more seamless, localized checkout experience for guests worldwide.\nAs Airbnb continues to expand globally, our payments platform will keep evolving with the same principles of extensibility, reliability, and scalability, ensuring that guests everywhere can pay confidently, using the methods they know and trust.\nAcknowledgments\nWe had many people at Airbnb contributing to this big rearchitecture, but countless thanks to Mini Atwal, Ashish Singla, Musaab At-Taras,Linmin Yang, Yong Rhyu, Yohannes Tsegay, Livar Cunha, Praveena Subrahmanyam, Steve Ickes, Vijaykumar Borkar, Vibhu Ramani, Aashna Jain, Abhishek Ghosh, Abhishek Patel, Adithya Tammavarapu, Akai Hsieh, Akash Budhia, Amar Parkash, Amee Mewada, Ankita Balakrushan Tate, Bharath Kumar Chandramouli, Bo Shi, Bo Yuan.

An individual’s experience and mastery were the greatest assets, passed down only within a person’s head or a limited part of an organization. The central question in that era was naturally “How do we implement this?” Anyone who could answer that how well was considered a valuable talent and central to work.\nThen time passed through the eras of know-what and know-where. As information became easier to find and more high-quality content was created, developers could get a lot of work done simply by searching Google, Stack Overflow, and other sources. Still, the core was know-how — because the quality of information was high enough that finding it generally meant it was reliable.\nBut now that period is becoming the era of “Know-Right.” (I’m not sure if this term really exists or is correct — I’m using it for my own thinking…) Information can be composed easily (I think “composed” is more accurate than “searched”), but now we must verify the reliability of that information. (I’m using AI assistance to write this, so you should verify this text’s reliability too.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a simple summary in a table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategoryKnow-howKnow-whatKnow-whereKnow-Right\n\nFocus Era1990s ~ mid-2000slate 2000s ~ mid-2010slate 2010s ~ early 2020smid-2020s ~ (AI era)\nCore QuestionHow do I implement this?What should I use?Where is the answer?Is this answer really correct?\nLocation of KnowledgePersonal experience, internal docsOfficial docs, patterns, best practicesSearch engines, GitHub, Q&AContext, constraints, system understanding\nDeveloper StrengthSkilled hands-on abilityCorrect selection abilityFast searching abilityJudgment, validation, reasoning ability\nLearning MethodRepetition, trial-and-errorCase study, comparative learningOptimized search, reference tracingDeep understanding + cross-validation\nCause of FailureLack of experienceWrong choicesCopy-paste lacking contextAccepting without verification\nRole of AIAlmost noneReference toolPowerful searcherBoth a subject of judgment and a tool\n\n\n\n\n\nSo how does this change the way we think? For example, think about a simple Redis failure problem:\n\nEraDeveloper Reaction\n\nKnow-how“We tuned it this way before and fixed it.”\nKnow-what“This issue is caused by KEYS; use SCAN instead.”\nKnow-where“There’s a solution in the official docs and on GitHub.”\nKnow-Right“For this workload, SCAN is also risky, and the real problem is the data model.”\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen ChatGPT first came out, things weren’t this extreme, but the pace of change keeps increasing and the importance of verification is growing. Now the question arises: So how should people prepare for this? Does it necessarily mean that humans must verify everything?\nSome people say that, just as we don’t verify every line of machine code the compiler generates and managers don’t review every result a team member produces, we should accept a certain level of mistakes. That perspective isn’t wrong. But still, a single mistake can cause a huge problem — and while humans can sometimes understand their own mistakes, AI mistakes might be unknowable. (There is no definitive answer here — in a few years this discussion itself might be meaningless.)\nOne technique to improve LLM reliability is test-time scaling: using a smaller model to evaluate what the larger model generates and filtering out responses below a reliability threshold — effectively enhancing performance by throwing out low-confidence results. This resembles using other models (or smaller ones) to verify output, and it shows why evaluating trustworthiness of results is becoming more crucial for people who use this information.\nSo my question becomes: How should “people” be educated in this era? …I’ll leave that discussion for another time (maybe — I’m still thinking about it).",

LLM이 생성하는 내용을 더 성능이 작은 SLM으로 평가해서 어느 정도 점수 이하인 것은 버림으로써 도리어 성능을 높일 수 있다는 방법인데, 어느정도 가드레일을 주거나, 나온 결과의 신뢰성을 평가하기 위해서 다른 LLM(혹은 SLM)을 쓰는 것과 유사한데… 신뢰도가 낮은 결과는 버림으로써, 신뢰를 확보한다는 것인데… 이런 정보를 써야 하는 입장에서는 이런 부분을 더더욱 중요하게 봐야 하는 시대가 온 것다.\n 그래서 생기는 나의 고민은 그렇다면 이런 시기에 “사람”의 교육은 어떻게 되어야 하냐인데… 이 이야기는 다음 기회에… 해보기로 하자.(안할수도 있다. 현재 고민만 하고 있어서…)",

AI를 단순히 글이나 영상을 좀 더 편리하게 만들어주는 &lsquo;도우미&rsquo; 정도로 생각하는 것이 아니라, 우리의 가장 강력한 <b>전략적 무기</b>로 활용하는 방법을 알아내는 것이죠. 이제 AI는 선택이 아닌 필수이자, 제대로 활용한다면 상상 이상의 성과를 가져다줄 열쇠가 될 겁니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  키워드의 종말과 주제 권위성의 시대</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">가장 근본적인 변화부터 짚고 넘어가죠. 바로 <b>키워드의 종말</b>입니다. 예전에는 '강남역 맛집'이라는 글을 쓸 때, 본문에 이 단어를 스무 번씩 반복해서 넣는 것이 일종의 '정석'처럼 여겨졌죠. 하지만 2026년 현재, 이런 전략은 더 이상 아무런 의미가 없습니다. 아니, 오히려 <b>어뷰징(abusing)</b>으로 분류되어 감점 요인이 될 수도 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">구글의 <b>SGE(Search Generative Experience)</b>나 네이버의 CUE와 같은 생성형 엔진들은 이제 단어의 개수를 세는 것을 넘어, 콘텐츠의 <b>문맥과 의도</b>를 파악합니다. 그들이 집중하는 핵심은 단 하나입니다. <b>&ldquo;이 콘텐츠를 만든 사람이 이 주제에 대해 얼마나 깊이 있는 진짜 전문가인가?&rdquo;</b> 바로 이 '주제 권위성'을 평가하는 거죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, 여러분이 'AI 콘텐츠 마케팅'이라는 주제로 블로그를 운영한다고 가정해 봅시다. 과거에는 이 키워드를 포함한 글을 여러 개 발행했을 거예요. 하지만 이제는 접근법이 완전히 달라져야 합니다.

맞습니다. 조회수와 시청 시간이었죠. 그래서 어떻게든 자극적인 썸네일과 제목으로 클릭을 유도하고, 일단 시청자를 영상에 붙잡아두는 것이 중요했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">하지만 2026년 현재, 유튜브 알고리즘은 오직 단 하나의 지표, 바로 <b>시청자 만족도</b>에만 집착합니다. 예를 들어, '초특가 아이폰 공짜로 사는 법' 같은 썸네일에 이끌려 영상을 클릭했는데, 막상 내용은 별것 없는 광고뿐이라면 시청자는 어떻게 반응할까요? 당연히 10초도 안 보고 영상을 꺼버리겠죠. 과거에는 이런 행동이 단순히 '이탈률이 높구나' 정도로 끝났지만, 이제는 다릅니다. 이탈하는 시청자의 행동 하나하나가 '이 채널은 시청자를 속이는 나쁜 채널'이라는 강력한 <b>패널티 신호</b>로 쌓이게 됩니다. 그리고 이 패널티는 해당 영상 하나로 끝나는 것이 아니라, 채널 전체의 노출량을 심각하게 깎아버리는 결과를 초래하죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이제부터 유튜브에서의 유일한 성공 공식은 아주 명확해졌습니다. 시청자가 여러분의 영상을 다 보고 나서 '아, 진짜 시간을 잘 썼다. 이 채널 구독하길 정말 잘했다'고 <b>진심으로 느끼게 만드는 것</b>. 이것이 바로 전부입니다. 시청자의 진정한 만족이 곧 채널의 성장으로 직결되는 시대가 온 거죠.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>⚙️ 3단계 하이브리드 퍼널 전략: AI 시대의 유튜브 성공 공식</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그렇다면 이 완전히 새로운 전쟁터에서 우리는 어떻게 구체적으로 승리할 수 있을까요?

        "contentSnippet": "2026년, 디지털 콘텐츠 시장은 거대한 변화의 물결에 휩싸였습니다. 이제는 단순히 키워드를 나열하는 SEO 시대가 아닌, 생성형 AI 검색(SGE/CUE)이 지배하는 GEO(Generative Engine Optimization) 시대가 도래했죠. AI는 더 이상 단순한 도구가 아니라, 콘텐츠의 생존과 수익을 결정하는 핵심 플레이어가 되었습니다. 이 글에서는 AI 슬롭(AI Slop)의 함정을 피하고, HIT(Human in the Loop) 전략을 통해 여러분의 콘텐츠를 AI 시대의 핵심 자산으로 만드는 구체적인 방법을 제시합니다. 키워드의 종말부터 제로 클릭 검색, 유튜브 알고리즘의 변화, 그리고 커뮤니티 기반 수익화까지, 새로운 디지털 수익화 공식을 파헤쳐 보세요.\n\n\n여러분, 2026년 바로 이 시점에서 혹시 유튜브나 블로그 수익이 갑자기 0원이 될 수도 있다는 사실을 알고 계셨나요? 물론, 단순히 겁을 주려는 이야기는 아닙니다. 구글과 유튜브의 새로운 AI 알고리즘이 여러분의 콘텐츠를 ‘AI 스팸’으로 분류하는 순간, 공들여 만든 모든 것이 검색 결과에서 사라져 버릴 수 있다는 현실적인 경고입니다. 실제로 일부 유튜브 쇼츠 채널들이 이미 이 AI 슬롭(AI Slop)이라는 함정에 빠져 어려움을 겪고 있고요. 그렇다면 이 거대한 변화 속에서 우리는 어떻게 살아남을 수 있을까요? 이 위기를 오히려 기회로 바꾸는 방법은 없을까요? 지금부터 2026년 디지털 수익화의 새로운 공식을 하나하나 파헤쳐 보겠습니다.\n  2026년, 디지털 수익의 대격변: SEO에서 GEO로\n최근 최신 컨설팅 보고서들을 리서치하면서 정말 놀라운 사실을 깨달았습니다. 우리가 익히 알던 기존의 검색 방식, 즉 SEO(Search Engine Optimization) 게임의 룰이 완전히 바뀌었다는 것입니다. 아니, 바뀌었다기보다는 이제는 거의 종착역에 도달했다고 보는 게 맞을 것 같아요. 이제는 GEO(Generative Engine Optimization), 즉 생성형 엔진 최적화라는 완전히 새로운 게임이 시작된 거죠. 이 변화는 단순히 검색 알고리즘의 업데이트 수준을 넘어선, 디지털 수익 생태계 전체의 대격변을 의미합니다.\n그렇다면 이 AI가 모든 것을 지배하는 새로운 환경에서 어떻게 해야 내 블로그나 유튜브 채널이 알고리즘의 처벌을 피하고, 오히려 AI의 선택을 받는 핵심 자산이 될 수 있을까요? 우리의 목표는 명확합니다. AI를 단순히 글이나 영상을 좀 더 편리하게 만들어주는 ‘도우미’ 정도로 생각하는 것이 아니라, 우리의 가장 강력한 전략적 무기로 활용하는 방법을 알아내는 것이죠. 이제 AI는 선택이 아닌 필수이자, 제대로 활용한다면 상상 이상의 성과를 가져다줄 열쇠가 될 겁니다.\n  키워드의 종말과 주제 권위성의 시대\n가장 근본적인 변화부터 짚고 넘어가죠. 바로 키워드의 종말입니다. 예전에는 '강남역 맛집'이라는 글을 쓸 때, 본문에 이 단어를 스무 번씩 반복해서 넣는 것이 일종의 '정석'처럼 여겨졌죠. 하지만 2026년 현재, 이런 전략은 더 이상 아무런 의미가 없습니다. 아니, 오히려 어뷰징(abusing)으로 분류되어 감점 요인이 될 수도 있습니다.\n구글의 SGE(Search Generative Experience)나 네이버의 CUE와 같은 생성형 엔진들은 이제 단어의 개수를 세는 것을 넘어, 콘텐츠의 문맥과 의도를 파악합니다. 그들이 집중하는 핵심은 단 하나입니다. “이 콘텐츠를 만든 사람이 이 주제에 대해 얼마나 깊이 있는 진짜 전문가인가?” 바로 이 '주제 권위성'을 평가하는 거죠.\n예를 들어, 여러분이 'AI 콘텐츠 마케팅'이라는 주제로 블로그를 운영한다고 가정해 봅시다. 과거에는 이 키워드를 포함한 글을 여러 개 발행했을 거예요. 하지만 이제는 접근법이 완전히 달라져야 합니다. 'AI 마케팅의 미래는?', 'AI 마케팅 툴 10가지 비교', 'AI 마케팅 실패 사례 분석' 등 사람들이 이 주제에 대해 궁금해할 만한 50개 이상의 세부 질문에 대해 각각 깊이 있는 답변을 제공하는 콘텐츠 클러스터(Content Cluster)를 구축해야 합니다.\n전체 콘텐츠의 80% 이상을 하나의 전문 주제에 집중할 때, AI는 비로소 여러분을 '믿을 만한 전문가'로 인식하고 검색 결과 상단에 적극적으로 노출하기 시작합니다. 여러 주제를 얕게 다루는 시대는 이제 정말 끝났다고 봐도 무방합니다.\n  GEO 시대의 핵심: AI는 단순히 키워드가 아닌, 콘텐츠의 문맥과 작성자의 전문성을 평가합니다. 하나의 주제에 깊이 파고들어 '주제 권위성'을 확보하는 것이 중요해요.\n  제로 클릭 검색과 새로운 포지션 제로\n여기서 더 충격적인 사실이 있습니다. 아무리 열심히 노력해서 전문가로 인정받아도, 정작 사람들이 여러분의 사이트를 클릭하지 않을 수도 있다는 거예요. 우리는 이를 제로 클릭 검색(Zero-Click Search)이라고 부릅니다. 말 그대로 검색 결과 페이지에서 웹사이트로의 클릭이 발생하지 않는 현상이죠. 최신 데이터에 따르면, 데스크톱 검색의 무려 46.5%, 거의 절반에 달하는 사용자들이 AI가 요약해 준 답변만 보고 검색을 끝내버린다고 합니다.\n이러한 변화로 인해 실제로 일부 글로벌 기업들은 자연 검색을 통한 방문자 수가 70%에서 80%까지 폭락하는 경험을 했습니다. 어제까지 1만 명이 방문하던 블로그에 갑자기 2천 명만 들어온다고 상상해 보세요. 정말 끔찍한 시나리오가 아닐 수 없습니다.\n따라서 이제 우리의 목표는 단순히 '클릭'이 되어서는 안 됩니다. 우리의 새로운 목표는 AI가 만들어낸 답변에 여러분의 이름이나 브랜드가 인용되는 것입니다. 예를 들어, '이 내용에 대한 더 자세한 정보는 OOO의 블로그를 참고했습니다'와 같이 출처로 명시되는 것이죠. 이것이 바로 새로운 포지션 제로(Position Zero), 즉 검색 결과 1위보다도 더 높은, AI 시대의 최고의 자리입니다. 내 콘텐츠가 AI 답변의 핵심 근거 자료로 채택되도록 만드는 것, 이것이 바로 GEO 시대의 진정한 승리 공식입니다.\n  2026년형 유튜브 알고리즘의 진실: 시청자 만족도\n이러한 변화의 물결은 유튜브에서도 거세게 몰아치고 있습니다. 어떻게 보면 검색 엔진보다 훨씬 더 직접적이고 강력한 영향을 미치고 있다고 생각해요. 과거 유튜브 성공 공식은 뭐였을까요? 맞습니다. 조회수와 시청 시간이었죠. 그래서 어떻게든 자극적인 썸네일과 제목으로 클릭을 유도하고, 일단 시청자를 영상에 붙잡아두는 것이 중요했습니다.\n하지만 2026년 현재, 유튜브 알고리즘은 오직 단 하나의 지표, 바로 시청자 만족도에만 집착합니다. 예를 들어, '초특가 아이폰 공짜로 사는 법' 같은 썸네일에 이끌려 영상을 클릭했는데, 막상 내용은 별것 없는 광고뿐이라면 시청자는 어떻게 반응할까요? 당연히 10초도 안 보고 영상을 꺼버리겠죠. 과거에는 이런 행동이 단순히 '이탈률이 높구나' 정도로 끝났지만, 이제는 다릅니다. 이탈하는 시청자의 행동 하나하나가 '이 채널은 시청자를 속이는 나쁜 채널'이라는 강력한 패널티 신호로 쌓이게 됩니다. 그리고 이 패널티는 해당 영상 하나로 끝나는 것이 아니라, 채널 전체의 노출량을 심각하게 깎아버리는 결과를 초래하죠.\n이제부터 유튜브에서의 유일한 성공 공식은 아주 명확해졌습니다. 시청자가 여러분의 영상을 다 보고 나서 '아, 진짜 시간을 잘 썼다. 이 채널 구독하길 정말 잘했다'고 진심으로 느끼게 만드는 것. 이것이 바로 전부입니다. 시청자의 진정한 만족이 곧 채널의 성장으로 직결되는 시대가 온 거죠.\n⚙️ 3단계 하이브리드 퍼널 전략: AI 시대의 유튜브 성공 공식\n그렇다면 이 완전히 새로운 전쟁터에서 우리는 어떻게 구체적으로 승리할 수 있을까요? 바로 2026년형 유튜브 성공 공식, 3단계 하이브리드 퍼널(Funnel) 전략입니다. 이 전략은 AI 시대에 최적화된 시청자 유입부터 수익화까지의 로드맵을 제시합니다.\n1단계: 유입 (Inflow) - 쇼츠를 정교한 필터로 활용\n이 단계의 핵심 무기는 바로 쇼츠(Shorts)입니다. 하지만 여기서 우리는 쇼츠에 대한 기존의 생각을 완전히 바꿔야 해요. 2026년에 쇼츠는 더 이상 단순한 바이럴 도구가 아닙니다. 아무에게나 노출되어 조회수를 높이는 것이 아니라, 정확한 타깃 시청자만 걸러내는 아주 정교한 필터로서의 역할을 수행해야 합니다. 주제에 관심도 없는 불특정 다수를 끌어모으는 것은 오히려 채널의 정체성을 흐리고 알고리즘에 나쁜 신호를 주는 최악의 전략이 될 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어 볼까요? 여러분이 최신 스마트폰을 깊이 있게 리뷰하는 기술 채널을 운영한다고 가정해 봅시다. 여기서 갑자기 요즘 유행하는 댄스 챌린지 쇼츠를 올리면 어떻게 될까요? 물론 조회수는 잠깐 폭발할 수도 있겠죠. 하지만 그 영상을 보고 들어온 수만 명의 사람들은 여러분의 전문적인 기술 리뷰에는 전혀 관심이 없을 겁니다. 이런 상황은 알고리즘에게 '이 채널은 정체성이 모호하니 기술에 관심 있는 사람들에게 추천하지 말아야겠다'는 신호를 줄 수 있습니다.\n대신에, 앞으로 리뷰할 스마트폰의 카메라 줌 기능을 100배 땡겨보는 10초짜리 쇼츠를 올려보세요. 그러면 정말 그 스마트폰 카메라 성능에 관심 있는 잠재 고객들만 여러분 채널로 유입될 겁니다. 이것이 바로 하이브리드 퍼널의 시작이자, 진짜 팬이 될 사람들을 모으는 첫 단추입니다.\n\n\n2단계: 신뢰 구축 (Building Trust) - 롱폼과 LVR 지표\n쇼츠라는 정교한 필터로 걸러진, 내 주제에 진짜 관심 있는 시청자들에게는 이제 롱폼(Long-form), 즉 긴 영상으로 깊이 있는 정보를 제공하며 신뢰를 구축해야 합니다. '당신은 나를 믿어도 좋다'는 확실한 신호를 주는 단계죠. 여기서 핵심은 알고리즘에게 '이 영상은 시청자들을 아주 만족시키고 있습니다'라는 구체적인 신호를 계속 보내는 것입니다.\n아주 중요한 숫자를 하나 제시해 드릴게요. 바로 좋아요/조회수 비율, LVR(Like View Ratio)입니다. 이 비율이 2%라면 그냥 보통 영상이지만, 만약 4%를 넘어간다면 유튜브 알고리즘은 '아, 이건 아주 훌륭한 영상이구나. 널리 알려야겠다'고 판단하여 추천을 폭발적으로 늘려준다고 합니다. 조회수가 1만 회인 영상이라면 좋아요가 최소 400개는 찍혀야 한다는 뜻이죠. LVR은 시청자가 '내 시간을 쓸 가치가 있었다'고 느끼는 가장 확실한 피드백이기 때문입니다.\n그럼 이 만족도를 어떻게 높일 수 있을까요? 두 가지 핵심 기술이 있습니다.\n영상 시작 5초 안에 핵심 가치 제시: '이 영상을 끝까지 보시면 당신은 이걸 얻어갈 수 있습니다'라는 명확한 가치를 제시해야 합니다. 두리뭉실하게 시작하면 시청자는 바로 이탈합니다.\n2~3분마다 시각적 변화: 사람의 집중력은 생각보다 짧습니다. 2~3분마다 의식적으로 화면 전환, 그래프 자료, 자막 강조 등 시각적인 변화를 주어 시청 유지율을 높여야 합니다.\n이러한 기술들로 시청 유지율을 높이고, 영상 마지막에는 '오늘 내용이 유익했다면 좋아요로 알려주세요'라고 정중하게 요청하여 LVR 4%를 달성하는 것, 이것이 이 단계의 중요한 목표입니다.\n3단계: 수익화 (Monetization) - 커뮤니티 기반의 지속 가능한 수익\n솔직히 말해서 2026년에 애드센스(AdSense)와 같은 광고 수익에만 의존하는 것은 매우 위험한 생각입니다. 최근 광고 수익의 중요도는 계속해서 낮아지고 있어요. 진짜 돈, 지속 가능한 수익은 여러분의 채널을 열성적으로 지지하는 팬덤, 바로 커뮤니티에서 나옵니다. 핵심 수익원은 크게 세 가지로 볼 수 있습니다.\n멤버십 (Memberships): 채널의 유료 멤버십을 통해 독점 콘텐츠나 혜택을 제공합니다.\n슈퍼챗 (Super Chat) 및 후원: 라이브 스트리밍 시 시청자들의 자발적인 후원을 유도합니다.\n브랜드 협력 (Brand Partnerships): 채널의 전문성을 인정하는 브랜드와의 협업을 통해 수익을 창출합니다.\n여기서 가장 중요한 건 '왜 나를 후원해야 하는가?'에 대한 명확한 가치를 제시하는 겁니다. 옛날처럼 '여러분의 후원이 제게 큰 힘이 됩니다' 같은 감성적인 호소는 더 이상 통하지 않아요. 시청자들은 명확한 가치 교환을 원합니다.\n예를 들면 이런 거죠. '제 채널에 VIP 멤버가 되시면 매주 목요일 저와 함께하는 비공개 실시간 Q&A에 참여하실 수 있고, 제가 만드는 모든 강의 자료 원본 파일을 미리 받아보실 수 있습니다.' 어때요? 아주 구체적이고 매력적인 혜택을 줘야 하는 겁니다. 이것은 구글에 의존하는 것이 아니라, 당당한 비즈니스 모델입니다. 이 개념으로 접근해야만 여러분의 채널이 단순한 취미가 아니라 지속 가능한 사업체가 될 수 있습니다.\n\n\n✨ AI 자동화의 빛과 그림자: 생산성 혁명 vs. AI 슬롭 페널티\n이제 정말 흥미로운 이야기, AI 자동화로 넘어가 보겠습니다. AI는 마치 강력한 마법 지팡이 같아요. 이걸 잘 쓰면 생산성을 10배 이상 높이는 혁명의 도구가 되지만, 잘못 휘두르면 여러분의 모든 것을 파괴하는 저주의 함정이 될 수도 있습니다.\nAI의 빛: 상상을 초월하는 생산성 향상\nAI를 제대로만 활용하면 우리의 생산성은 정말 상상을 초월할 정도로 높아집니다. 여기서 강조할 세 가지 핵심 기술이 있어요.\nAI 에이전트 리서치: 퍼플렉시티(Perplexity) 같은 AI 검색 엔진을 사용해 보세요. 예전에는 특정 주제 자료를 모으려고 논문 뒤지고, 해외 기사 번역하느라 6시간 넘게 걸렸죠. 이제 AI에게 질문 하나만 던지면 단 15분 만에 전 세계 최신 정보를 싹 요약해서 보고서 형태로 만들어 줍니다. 이건 단순히 시간을 아끼는 수준이 아니라, 콘텐츠의 깊이 자체가 달라지는 경험을 선사합니다.\n멀티모달 영상 편집: 이건 정말 혁명적입니다. 1시간짜리 강연 영상을 녹화했다고 칩시다. 팩토리(Factory)나 디스크립트(Descript) 같은 툴에 올리기만 하면, AI가 영상의 핵심 내용을 자동으로 분석해서 30분 안에 쇼츠 영상 10개를 뚝딱 만들어줍니다. 편집자 한 명의 몫을 AI가 거뜬히 해내는 셈이죠.\nAI 다국어 더빙: 일레븐랩스(ElevenLabs)나 헤이젠(HeyGen) 같은 서비스를 이용하면, 한국어로 만든 단 하나의 영상으로 무려 120개 언어의 더빙 버전을 만들 수 있습니다. 놀라운 건, 여러분의 목소리 톤과 감정을 그대로 유지하면서도 말이죠. 예전에는 이런 작업을 위해 수천만 원이 들었지만, 이제는 그 비용의 1/5 수준으로 줄었습니다. 여러분의 콘텐츠가 전 세계 시장에 동시에 진출할 수 있는 문이 활짝 열린 겁니다.\nAI의 그림자: AI 슬롭(AI Slop) 페널티의 실체\n하지만, 여기서부터가 정말 중요합니다. 이렇게 AI로 편리하게 대량으로 찍어낸 저품질 콘텐츠를 전문가들은 AI 슬롭(AI Slop), 우리말로는 'AI 오물'이라고 부르거든요. 그리고 구글과 유튜브는 이 AI 슬롭을 무려 95% 이상의 무서운 정확도로 잡아냅니다. 알고리즘이 AI 슬롭을 탐지하는 신호는 아주 명확하다고 해요.\n반복적인 문장 구조와 딱딱한 톤: 여러 영상이나 글에서 똑같은 문장 구조나 기계적인 톤이 반복되는 경우.\n감정 없는 로봇 같은 기계음: 영상에서 감정의 높낮이가 없는 기계음이 사용된 경우.\n불분명한 출처: 이 콘텐츠를 누가 만들었는지 출처가 불분명한 경우.\n시청자들의 부정적 피드백: 사용자들이 '관심 없음' 버튼을 누르거나 '이거 AI가 만들었죠?' 같은 부정적인 댓글이 달리는 경우.\n이런 데이터가 쌓이면 바로 경고등이 켜지는 겁니다. 한번 AI 슬롭으로 찍히면 그 타격은 정말 치명적이에요. 한 연구 결과를 보니, 저품질 AI 영상은 인간이 직접 만든 일반 영상보다 트래픽이 무려 5.44배나 감소했다고 합니다. 이건 단순히 노출이 좀 줄어드는 수준이 아니에요. 심지어 기존 구독자 수를 알고리즘이 줄여버리는 조치까지 적용하기 시작했다는 겁니다. 100% 자동화로 편하게 돈 벌려다가, 내 채널 자체가 그냥 공중분해될 수 있다는 뜻이죠.\n⚠️ AI 슬롭 경고: 100% AI 자동화는 편리함을 넘어 디지털 자폭 행위가 될 수 있습니다. 알고리즘은 AI가 만든 저품질 콘텐츠를 정확하게 탐지하며, 이는 채널 트래픽 및 구독자 수 감소로 이어집니다.\n  HIT 전략: 인간 개입 시스템 (Human in the Loop)\n그렇다면 이 문제점에 대한 해답은 뭘까요? AI를 아예 쓰지 말아야 할까요? 아니요, 그건 절대 아닙니다. 2026년 디지털 콘텐츠 시장의 최종 승리 전략은 바로 HIT(Human in the Loop), 즉 인간 개입 시스템입니다. AI만으로 모든 것을 자동화하는 채널도, 오직 인간의 노동력만으로 콘텐츠를 만드는 채널도 아닌, 인간과 AI의 장점만을 전략적으로 결합하는 채널이 모든 것을 차지하게 될 겁니다.\n여기서 '진정성 차익 거래'라는 아주 흥미로운 개념이 등장합니다. AI가 만든 그럴싸한 콘텐츠가 세상에 넘쳐날수록, 역설적으로 인간의 손길이 닿은 날것 그대로의 진정성 있는 콘텐츠의 가치가 희귀해져 폭등한다는 의미입니다. 마치 공장에서 찍어낸 기성품들 사이에서 장인이 한 땀 한 땀 만든 수제품이 훨씬 비싸게 팔리는 것과 같은 원리죠.\n핵심은 역할 분담입니다. 반복적인 작업, 자료 조사, 데이터 분석, 초안 생성 같은 지루하고 힘든 일은 AI라는 유능한 비서에게 맡기세요. 그리고 인간인 여러분은 더 중요한 일에 집중하는 겁니다. 바로 전체적인 방향을 잡는 전략 수립, 중요한 최종 판단, 그리고 AI가 절대로 흉내 낼 수 없는 여러분만의 인간적인 감성과 경험을 콘텐츠에 불어넣는 것이죠. AI의 압도적인 효율성과 인간의 따뜻한 진정성이 만날 때, 그 누구도 따라올 수 없는 강력한 경쟁 우위가 생기는 겁니다.\n\n\n⏳ 실제 콘텐츠 제작 워크플로: 90분의 기적\n그럼 실제 콘텐츠 제작 과정을 시간 단위로 한번 쪼개볼까요? HIT 전략이 어떻게 우리의 일상에 적용될 수 있는지 명확하게 보여드릴게요.\n단계\n주체\n활동 내용\n소요 시간\n\n\n\n\n1. 자료 리서치\nAI\n전 세계 최신 정보 요약 및 보고서 생성\n15분\n\n\n2. 기획 및 전략 수립\n인간\n핵심 메시지, 스토리라인 구상\n30분\n\n\n3. 초안 생성\nAI\n기획에 맞춰 대본/글 초안 자동 생성\n즉시\n\n\n4. 최종 검토 및 인간적 터치\n인간\n경험담, 비유, 유머 추가, 글 다듬기\n45분\n\n\n5. 발행 및 홍보\nAI\nSNS 홍보 문구, 발행 등 마무리 작업\n즉시\n\n\n\n놀랍지 않나요? 예전에는 4시간에서 8시간까지 걸리던 고품질 콘텐츠 하나가 단 90분 안에 완성되는 겁니다. 80%의 시간을 절약하면서도 콘텐츠의 품질은 인간의 마지막 터치로 극대화할 수 있습니다. 꼭 기억하세요. AI로 뼈대를 세우되, 마지막 10분은 반드시 여러분의 영혼, 즉 여러분의 경험과 진정성으로 채워 넣어야 합니다. 그것이 AI 슬롭 페널티라는 저주를 피하고 2026년에 성공하는 유일한 길입니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ SEO는 죽었다? GEO 시대의 도래: AI는 키워드 대신 '주제 권위성'과 '콘텐츠 클러스터'에 집중하며, AI의 인용을 받는 '새로운 포지션 제로'가 핵심 목표입니다.\n✅ 유튜브 알고리즘의 변화: 조회수보다 '시청자 만족도'에 집중하세요. 쇼츠는 '정교한 필터'로, 롱폼은 LVR(좋아요/조회수 비율 4% 이상)을 통한 '신뢰 구축'에 활용해야 합니다.\n✅ AI의 양면성: AI는 생산성을 10배 높이는 도구이지만, 100% 자동화된 저품질 'AI 슬롭'은 치명적인 페널티로 이어집니다. AI 활용 시 '인간적 터치'가 필수입니다.\n✅ HIT 전략으로 살아남기: AI에게는 반복 작업을, 인간에게는 전략 수립과 '진정성'을 부여하는 'Human in the Loop' 시스템이 AI 시대 콘텐츠 제작의 최종 승리 공식입니다.\n이러한 변화에 능동적으로 대응해야만 2026년 이후의 디지털 콘텐츠 시장에서 지속 가능한 성공을 거둘 수 있습니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: GEO(생성형 엔진 최적화)는 무엇이며, 기존 SEO와 어떻게 다른가요?\nA1: GEO는 생성형 AI 검색 엔진(SGE, CUE 등)에 콘텐츠를 최적화하는 전략입니다. 기존 SEO가 특정 키워드 반복과 검색량에 초점을 맞췄다면, GEO는 AI가 콘텐츠의 문맥과 작성자의 '주제 권위성'을 파악하여 답변에 인용하도록 만드는 것을 목표로 합니다. 이제는 키워드 밀도보다 콘텐츠의 깊이와 전문성이 훨씬 중요해졌습니다.\nQ2: '제로 클릭 검색' 시대에 웹사이트 트래픽을 늘리는 방법은 무엇인가요?\nA2: 제로 클릭 검색으로 인해 직접적인 웹사이트 방문은 줄어들 수 있습니다. 이 시대의 목표는 AI가 생성하는 답변에 여러분의 콘텐츠가 '출처'로 인용되는 '새로운 포지션 제로'를 달성하는 것입니다. 이를 위해서는 하나의 전문 주제에 대한 깊이 있는 '콘텐츠 클러스터'를 구축하여 AI가 여러분을 해당 분야의 권위 있는 정보원으로 인식하도록 해야 합니다.\nQ3: 유튜브에서 'AI 슬롭' 페널티를 피하고 성공하려면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\nA3: AI 슬롭은 AI가 만든 저품질 콘텐츠를 의미하며, 유튜브 알고리즘은 이를 정확하게 탐지하여 채널에 페널티를 줍니다. 이를 피하려면 'HIT(Human in the Loop) 전략'을 사용해야 합니다. AI에게는 자료 조사나 초안 생성 같은 반복 작업을 맡기고, 인간인 여러분은 콘텐츠의 전략 수립, 최종 검토, 그리고 인간적인 감성과 경험을 불어넣는 역할에 집중하여 진정성 있는 고품질 콘텐츠를 만들어야 합니다.\n오늘 분석한 내용, 머릿속이 조금 복잡하셨을 수도 있겠네요. 제가 딱 세 문장으로 핵심을 요약해 드리겠습니다. 첫째, AI는 당신의 유능한 부사수일 뿐, 전략을 짜고 최종 결정을 내리는 CEO는 언제나 당신 자신이어야 합니다. 둘째, 쇼츠라는 필터로 진짜 타깃을 모으고, 롱폼 영상으로 깊은 신뢰를 쌓고, 커뮤니티를 통해 진짜 수익을 내십시오. 셋째, 100% 자동화는 편리함이 아니라 디지털 자폭 행위입니다. AI가 만든 초안에 당신의 경험과 진정성이라는 영혼을 반드시 불어넣으십시오.\n마지막으로, 오늘 밤 혼자 조용히 생각해 볼 만한 질문을 하나 던지며 마무리하겠습니다. 2026년에 디지털 시장은 규모의 경쟁이 아니라 정교함과 진정성의 경쟁입니다. 이제 AI는 당신의 글, 당신의 영상, 심지어 당신의 목소리까지 거의 완벽하게 복제할 수 있는 세상이 왔습니다. 그렇다면 AI가 절대로 복제할 수 없는, 오직 당신만이 가진 고유한 가치는 무엇입니까? 여러분의 콘텐츠에서 한번 그 답을 찾아보시길 바랍니다.\n이 글이 AI 시대의 콘텐츠 전략을 세우는 데 도움이 되셨기를 진심으로 바랍니다. 감사합니다!\n⚙️ '2026 AI 시대 디지털 생존 가이드' 무료배포!\n기존의 검색 방식은 끝났습니다. 위기를 기회로 만드는 GEO 전략과 수익화의 모든 것.\n2026년, 여러분의 유튜브나 블로그 수익이 한순간에 0원이 될 수 있습니다. 구글과 유튜브의 새로운 AI 알고리즘이 여러분의 콘텐츠를 'AI 스팸'으로 감지하는 순간, 공들여 만든 결과물들은 디지털 심해 속으로 사라져 보이지 않게 됩니다. \n이것은 겁을 주기 위함이 아니라 현실입니다. 기존의 SEO 게임 룰은 끝났습니다. 이제는 생성형 엔진 최적, 즉 GEO(Generative Engine Optimization)의 시대입니다. 이 가이드북은 AI를 가장 강력한 전략적 무기로 만들어 여러분의 채널을 핵심 자산으로 키워내는 구체적인 실행 계획을 담고 있습니다.\n\n \n2026 AI 시대 디지털 생존 전략 가이드북\n \n2026-ai-survival-guide.vercel.app",

NotebookLM은 지식 관리의 많은 부분을 알아서 처리해주면서도, 그 과정은 오롯이 개인적인 경험으로 남게 해주는 정말 멋진 도구입니다. 학습 저널로서 NotebookLM은 <b>여러분의 AI 파트너</b>가 되어, 직접 제공한 자료에서 통찰력을 뽑아내고, 복잡한 개념을 명확히 설명해주며, 심지어 성찰까지 유도해줍니다. 이건 단순히 저널링을 넘어, 새로운 주제나 익숙한 주제를 깊이 있게 탐색하는 <b>&lsquo;가이드 탐험&rsquo;</b>에 가깝다고 할 수 있어요. 정말이지&hellip; 이런 경험은 흔치 않죠.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  왜 NotebookLM은 학습 저널로 빛을 발할까요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 NotebookLM을 학습 저널로 활용하면서 가장 크게 느낀 장점은 바로 <b>&lsquo;접지된 정보(Grounded Sources)&rsquo;와 &lsquo;AI의 상호작용&rsquo;이 완벽하게 조화</b>된다는 점입니다. 많은 AI 도구가 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓지만, 출처가 불분명하거나 때로는 '환각(Hallucination)'을 보이기도 하죠. 하지만 NotebookLM은 오직 여러분이 업로드한 원본 파일에서만 정보를 추출합니다. 즉, 모든 요약이나 설명이 여러분의 실제 자료에 기반을 둔다는 의미죠. 일반적인 답변이나 틀린 정보를 받을 걱정 없이, AI가 제시하는 모든 내용은 여러분이 읽은 자료, 슬라이드, 개인 메모와 긴밀하게 연결되어 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #0f4c81; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #333333;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">  <b>핵심 포인트:</b> NotebookLM은 업로드된 자료를 기반으로 작동하기 때문에, AI의 답변이 항상 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있습니다. <b>&lsquo;환각&rsquo; 현상으로부터 자유롭다</b>는 것이 가장 큰 매력이죠.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 첫 학습 저널 프로젝트로 <b>&ldquo;창의적 사고(Creative Thinking)&rdquo;</b>라는 주제를 선택했습니다. 이 주제는 프레임워크, 심리학, 그리고 실용적인 연습 방법을 아우르기 때문에 다루기에도 좋았어요. 여러분도 관심 있는 어떤 주제든 상관없습니다. NotebookLM은 어떤 주제든 아이디어 친화적인 글머리 기호나 심층 보고서로 변환할 수 있습니다. 필요한 부분을 잘라내고 조합하면서 나만의 방식으로 재구성할 수 있다는 점이 정말 편리했어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 측면 사고(lateral thinking), 제약 기반 창의성(constraint-based creativity), 브레인스토밍 모델에 대한 여러 아티클을 업로드했을 때, NotebookLM은 몇 분 만에 핵심 요점들을 효과적으로 엮어주었습니다. 단순히 요약하는 것을 넘어, 저는 <b>저만의 메모와 성찰을 추가</b>할 수 있었고, 이것이 바로 저널링의 핵심 부분이라고 생각합니다. 이렇게 추가된 메모들 역시 기존 자료들과 연결되는 &lsquo;소스&rsquo;가 됩니다. 학습하는 동안 저널이 스스로 업데이트되는 것을 보면서, 자료 정리와 기록에 대한 부담이 확 줄어드는 것을 바로 느끼실 수 있을 거예요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bkujZt/dJMcaiaWKuX/CJxQRm0D3MK62VxRoKRekK/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bkujZt/dJMcaiaWKuX/CJxQRm0D3MK62VxRoKRekK/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bkujZt/dJMcaiaWKuX/CJxQRm0D3MK62VxRoKRekK/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbkujZt%2FdJMcaiaWKuX%2FCJxQRm0D3MK62VxRoKRekK%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"노트북LM 화면에서 AI가 다양한 출처의 문서를 연결하고 분석하여 통찰력을 제공하는 모습.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  나만의 학습 저널, 어떻게 세팅했나요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">NotebookLM을 학습 저널로 가장 유용하게 활용하는 방법은 <b>각 주제마다 별도의 노트북을 만드는 것</b>입니다. 이렇게 하면 AI가 올바른 자료에 집중할 수 있도록 돕는 역할을 합니다. 저는 '창의적 사고' 노트북 안에 연구 자료 조각, 저장해둔 프롬프트, PDF 챕터 스냅샷, 그리고 제가 이전에 작성했던 몇몇 메모까지 창의성과 관련된 모든 자료를 업로드했습니다. 이렇게 하니 AI가 완벽한 기반을 갖추게 되었고, AI의 모든 설명이 제가 중요하게 여기는 아이디어들과 일관성을 유지할 수 있었습니다. 정말이지 이렇게 체계적으로 정보를 관리할 수 있다는 점이 놀라웠어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">진정한 저널링은 바로 이 <b>&lsquo;노트(Notes)&rsquo;</b> 섹션에서 일어납니다. NotebookLM이 명확한 설명을 생성하거나 프롬프트에서 통찰력을 얻을 때마다, 저는 그것을 노트로 저장합니다. 또한, 새로운 노트를 추가하여 저만의 성찰을 기록하고 원하는 형식으로 편집할 수 있어요. 때로는 제가 배운 것에 대한 한두 줄의 짧은 문장이 될 수도 있고, 다른 때에는 제가 깊이 고민하고 있는 질문이 되기도 하죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #0f4c81; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #333333;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">  <b>팁:</b> 단순히 텍스트 노트 외에도, NotebookLM은 <b>보고서, 학습 가이드, 마인드맵, 심지어 오디오 팟캐스트</b>까지 저널의 일부로 포함시킬 수 있습니다. 다양한 형식으로 학습 과정을 풍부하게 기록해보세요!</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">꾸준한 NotebookLM 연구 및 학습 워크플로우를 통해 이 도구는 저의 가장 큰 아이디어들을 담아내는 <b>성장하는 레퍼런스 라이브러리</b>로 빠르게 변모하고 있습니다. 여러분도 분명 같은 경험을 하시리라 생각합니다. 제가 직접 사용해보니, 이렇게 지식이 쌓이는 과정 자체가 굉장히 보람 있더라고요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-origin-width=\"1823\" data-origin-height=\"884\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cz0Cfk/dJMcaa42ZZ0/UN6Kk66fk6TGQq0XHgNwhk/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cz0Cfk/dJMcaa42ZZ0/UN6Kk66fk6TGQq0XHgNwhk/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cz0Cfk/dJMcaa42ZZ0/UN6Kk66fk6TGQq0XHgNwhk/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fcz0Cfk%2FdJMcaa42ZZ0%2FUN6Kk66fk6TGQq0XHgNwhk%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"노트북LM에서 '창의적 사고' 주제로 정리된 디지털 학습 저널.

NotebookLM은 즉시 이 새로운 자료를 제가 이미 가지고 있는 자료들과 연결시킬 수 있어요. 그 다음, 관련된 문서들을 선택하고 나머지는 선택 해제한 뒤 다음과 같이 질문합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #highlightbg; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #333333;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"선택된 자료를 기반으로 [주제 1]과 [주제 2]를 비교해줘.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이렇게 하면 모든 자료를 다시 훑어볼 필요 없이 새로운 아이디어들을 빠르게 파악할 수 있습니다. 만약 무언가 불분명하게 느껴진다면, NotebookLM에게 더 간단한 언어로 설명해달라고 요청하거나 제 문서와 관련된 예시를 들어달라고 합니다. 이때, Reddit에서 유래한 <b>&lsquo;ELI5&rsquo; (Explain Like I'm 5, 5살 아이에게 설명하듯이) 프롬프트</b>를 사용해보세요. 설명이 제 자료에서 나오기 때문에 항상 관련성이 높고, 이해하기 쉽게 다가옵니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">각 세션은 항상 작은 성찰로 마무리합니다. <b>&lsquo;무엇을 배웠고&rsquo;, &lsquo;어디에 적용하고 싶은지&rsquo;</b>를 기록하는 것이죠. 제 자신의 목소리로 기록하기 때문에 저널이 AI 텍스트의 벽처럼 느껴지지 않고, 온전히 저의 것으로 남습니다. 이런 개인적인 기록이 쌓여갈수록 정말 뿌듯하더라고요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">또 다른 제가 좋아하는 방법은 자료에서 자주 묻는 질문(FAQ) 목록을 생성하고, 각 답변에 출처 문서 링크를 라벨링하도록 NotebookLM에 프롬프트를 주는 것입니다. 이 FAQ는 제가 주제에 대해 얼마나 이해하고 있는지 전체적인 시각을 제공하고, 부족한 부분을 채우는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다. 이 기능을 활용하면 굳이 스스로 질문을 만들 필요가 없어 시간을 절약할 수 있죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #highlightbg; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #333333;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"자료들에 대한 FAQ를 생성하고, 각 FAQ의 출처를 명시해줘.\"</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">참고로, NotebookLM을 ChatGPT나 Perplexity와 결합하면 프롬프트 활용도를 더욱 높일 수 있습니다. 기본 프롬프트를 작성한 다음, ChatGPT에게 더 구체적으로 다듬어달라고 요청하거나, Perplexity를 사용하여 연구 주장을 교차 검증하는 방식으로 활용할 수 있습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "수많은 정보의 홍수 속에서 나만의 지식 체계를 구축하고 싶으신가요?  AI와 생산성 분야에 깊은 관심을 쏟아왔는데요, 솔직히 고백하자면, 저는 학습 저널링을 시도했지만 늘 어렵게 느껴졌어요. 그런데 NotebookLM을 만나면서 모든 것이 바뀌었습니다. 이 포스트에서 저만의 NotebookLM 학습 저널 구축 가이드를 A부터 Z까지 알려드릴게요!\n\n\n학습 저널링, 여러분은 어떻게 생각하시나요? 제게 학습 저널은 그저 배운 것을 기록하는 '로그'에 가까웠습니다. 그런데 NotebookLM의 인공지능 마법을 경험하고 나서는, 이 개념이 완전히 달라졌어요. 단순히 기록을 넘어, 상호작용하는 가이드북이자 깊은 성찰을 이끄는 일기가 될 수 있다는 사실에 정말 놀랐습니다.\n처음에는 그저 실험 삼아 시작했지만, 지금은 꾸준히 이어갈 수 있는 소중한 습관으로 자리 잡았죠. NotebookLM은 지식 관리의 많은 부분을 알아서 처리해주면서도, 그 과정은 오롯이 개인적인 경험으로 남게 해주는 정말 멋진 도구입니다. 학습 저널로서 NotebookLM은 여러분의 AI 파트너가 되어, 직접 제공한 자료에서 통찰력을 뽑아내고, 복잡한 개념을 명확히 설명해주며, 심지어 성찰까지 유도해줍니다. 이건 단순히 저널링을 넘어, 새로운 주제나 익숙한 주제를 깊이 있게 탐색하는 ‘가이드 탐험’에 가깝다고 할 수 있어요. 정말이지… 이런 경험은 흔치 않죠.\n  왜 NotebookLM은 학습 저널로 빛을 발할까요?\n제가 NotebookLM을 학습 저널로 활용하면서 가장 크게 느낀 장점은 바로 ‘접지된 정보(Grounded Sources)’와 ‘AI의 상호작용’이 완벽하게 조화된다는 점입니다. 많은 AI 도구가 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓지만, 출처가 불분명하거나 때로는 '환각(Hallucination)'을 보이기도 하죠. 하지만 NotebookLM은 오직 여러분이 업로드한 원본 파일에서만 정보를 추출합니다. 즉, 모든 요약이나 설명이 여러분의 실제 자료에 기반을 둔다는 의미죠. 일반적인 답변이나 틀린 정보를 받을 걱정 없이, AI가 제시하는 모든 내용은 여러분이 읽은 자료, 슬라이드, 개인 메모와 긴밀하게 연결되어 있습니다.\n  핵심 포인트: NotebookLM은 업로드된 자료를 기반으로 작동하기 때문에, AI의 답변이 항상 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있습니다. ‘환각’ 현상으로부터 자유롭다는 것이 가장 큰 매력이죠.\n저는 첫 학습 저널 프로젝트로 “창의적 사고(Creative Thinking)”라는 주제를 선택했습니다. 이 주제는 프레임워크, 심리학, 그리고 실용적인 연습 방법을 아우르기 때문에 다루기에도 좋았어요. 여러분도 관심 있는 어떤 주제든 상관없습니다. NotebookLM은 어떤 주제든 아이디어 친화적인 글머리 기호나 심층 보고서로 변환할 수 있습니다. 필요한 부분을 잘라내고 조합하면서 나만의 방식으로 재구성할 수 있다는 점이 정말 편리했어요.\n제가 측면 사고(lateral thinking), 제약 기반 창의성(constraint-based creativity), 브레인스토밍 모델에 대한 여러 아티클을 업로드했을 때, NotebookLM은 몇 분 만에 핵심 요점들을 효과적으로 엮어주었습니다. 단순히 요약하는 것을 넘어, 저는 저만의 메모와 성찰을 추가할 수 있었고, 이것이 바로 저널링의 핵심 부분이라고 생각합니다. 이렇게 추가된 메모들 역시 기존 자료들과 연결되는 ‘소스’가 됩니다. 학습하는 동안 저널이 스스로 업데이트되는 것을 보면서, 자료 정리와 기록에 대한 부담이 확 줄어드는 것을 바로 느끼실 수 있을 거예요.\n\n\n  나만의 학습 저널, 어떻게 세팅했나요?\nNotebookLM을 학습 저널로 가장 유용하게 활용하는 방법은 각 주제마다 별도의 노트북을 만드는 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 AI가 올바른 자료에 집중할 수 있도록 돕는 역할을 합니다. 저는 '창의적 사고' 노트북 안에 연구 자료 조각, 저장해둔 프롬프트, PDF 챕터 스냅샷, 그리고 제가 이전에 작성했던 몇몇 메모까지 창의성과 관련된 모든 자료를 업로드했습니다. 이렇게 하니 AI가 완벽한 기반을 갖추게 되었고, AI의 모든 설명이 제가 중요하게 여기는 아이디어들과 일관성을 유지할 수 있었습니다. 정말이지 이렇게 체계적으로 정보를 관리할 수 있다는 점이 놀라웠어요.\n진정한 저널링은 바로 이 ‘노트(Notes)’ 섹션에서 일어납니다. NotebookLM이 명확한 설명을 생성하거나 프롬프트에서 통찰력을 얻을 때마다, 저는 그것을 노트로 저장합니다. 또한, 새로운 노트를 추가하여 저만의 성찰을 기록하고 원하는 형식으로 편집할 수 있어요. 때로는 제가 배운 것에 대한 한두 줄의 짧은 문장이 될 수도 있고, 다른 때에는 제가 깊이 고민하고 있는 질문이 되기도 하죠.\n  팁: 단순히 텍스트 노트 외에도, NotebookLM은 보고서, 학습 가이드, 마인드맵, 심지어 오디오 팟캐스트까지 저널의 일부로 포함시킬 수 있습니다. 다양한 형식으로 학습 과정을 풍부하게 기록해보세요!\n꾸준한 NotebookLM 연구 및 학습 워크플로우를 통해 이 도구는 저의 가장 큰 아이디어들을 담아내는 성장하는 레퍼런스 라이브러리로 빠르게 변모하고 있습니다. 여러분도 분명 같은 경험을 하시리라 생각합니다. 제가 직접 사용해보니, 이렇게 지식이 쌓이는 과정 자체가 굉장히 보람 있더라고요.\n\n\n✍️ 저의 NotebookLM 학습 저널링 루틴은 이렇습니다\n저널링은 학습이라는 주요 활동에 대한 일종의 후속 조치입니다. 이상적으로는 저널링 시간을 20분 이내로 제한하려고 노력해요. 주된 목표는 방금 배운 것을 성찰하고, 해당 자료를 더 깊이 탐구하는 것입니다. 리처드 파인만(Richard Feynman)의 ‘파인만 학습법(Feynman Technique)’과 어느 정도 유사하다고 볼 수 있죠. 핵심은 '내가 이걸 정말 이해했는가?'를 스스로에게 묻는 과정입니다.\n학습 목표에 따라 NotebookLM에 프롬프트를 입력하여 이해도를 심화시킬 수 있습니다. 저는 ChatGPT 마이크로러닝 프롬프트를 활용하여 NotebookLM에 맞게 수정해서 사용하곤 해요. 먼저 새로운 아티클이나 메모를 업로드합니다. NotebookLM은 즉시 이 새로운 자료를 제가 이미 가지고 있는 자료들과 연결시킬 수 있어요. 그 다음, 관련된 문서들을 선택하고 나머지는 선택 해제한 뒤 다음과 같이 질문합니다.\n\"선택된 자료를 기반으로 [주제 1]과 [주제 2]를 비교해줘.\"\n이렇게 하면 모든 자료를 다시 훑어볼 필요 없이 새로운 아이디어들을 빠르게 파악할 수 있습니다. 만약 무언가 불분명하게 느껴진다면, NotebookLM에게 더 간단한 언어로 설명해달라고 요청하거나 제 문서와 관련된 예시를 들어달라고 합니다. 이때, Reddit에서 유래한 ‘ELI5’ (Explain Like I'm 5, 5살 아이에게 설명하듯이) 프롬프트를 사용해보세요. 설명이 제 자료에서 나오기 때문에 항상 관련성이 높고, 이해하기 쉽게 다가옵니다.\n각 세션은 항상 작은 성찰로 마무리합니다. ‘무엇을 배웠고’, ‘어디에 적용하고 싶은지’를 기록하는 것이죠. 제 자신의 목소리로 기록하기 때문에 저널이 AI 텍스트의 벽처럼 느껴지지 않고, 온전히 저의 것으로 남습니다. 이런 개인적인 기록이 쌓여갈수록 정말 뿌듯하더라고요.\n또 다른 제가 좋아하는 방법은 자료에서 자주 묻는 질문(FAQ) 목록을 생성하고, 각 답변에 출처 문서 링크를 라벨링하도록 NotebookLM에 프롬프트를 주는 것입니다. 이 FAQ는 제가 주제에 대해 얼마나 이해하고 있는지 전체적인 시각을 제공하고, 부족한 부분을 채우는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다. 이 기능을 활용하면 굳이 스스로 질문을 만들 필요가 없어 시간을 절약할 수 있죠.\n\"자료들에 대한 FAQ를 생성하고, 각 FAQ의 출처를 명시해줘.\"\n참고로, NotebookLM을 ChatGPT나 Perplexity와 결합하면 프롬프트 활용도를 더욱 높일 수 있습니다. 기본 프롬프트를 작성한 다음, ChatGPT에게 더 구체적으로 다듬어달라고 요청하거나, Perplexity를 사용하여 연구 주장을 교차 검증하는 방식으로 활용할 수 있습니다. AI 도구들을 서로 보완하며 사용했을 때 시너지가 정말 엄청나다는 것을 직접 경험해봤어요.\n ️ 저널을 더욱 강력하게 만드는 주간 습관들\n‘인출 연습(Retrieval practice)’은 NotebookLM에 기본적으로 내장되어 있습니다. NotebookLM의 학습 가이드 모드를 사용하여 자유로운 Q&A를 시도해보세요. 저는 일주일에 한두 번, NotebookLM의 학습 도구를 활용하여 한 발짝 물러서서 전체적인 그림을 보려고 노력합니다. 이렇게 하면 제가 탐구하고 있는 것들의 패턴을 발견하는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n학습 가이드는 한 주간의 자료에 대한 깔끔한 개요를 제공해주고, 이를 검토하면서 제가 탐색하는 주제들 속에서 어떤 패턴이 있는지 파악할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이건 마치 넓은 지식의 바다에서 등대 하나를 발견하는 것과 같다고 할 수 있어요. 이전에는 보이지 않던 연결고리들이 선명하게 드러나는 경험은 정말 값지다고 생각합니다.\n\n\nFAQ 외에도 저는 노트에서 플래시카드를 생성합니다. 이 과정을 통해 어떤 아이디어를 실제로 이해하고 있고, 어떤 아이디어를 다시 살펴봐야 하는지 깨닫게 되죠. 예전에 작성했던 노트를 빠르게 훑어보는 것만으로도 미처 알아채지 못했던 주제들을 발견하는 경우가 많습니다. 이런 습관들이 NotebookLM을 저의 학습 실험과 함께 성장하는 더욱 역동적인 저널로 만들어줍니다.\n✨ 흩어진 아이디어를 나만의 인사이트로!\nNotebookLM을 사용하면서 제가 가장 크게 느낀 점은 막연한 질문 대신 구체적인 질문을 던지도록 유도한다는 것입니다. 그리고 이렇게 구체적인 질문은 항상 더 명확한 통찰력으로 이어졌어요. 글을 쓰다가 막힐 때가 잦은 저는 NotebookLM이 제공하는 상황에 맞는 제안 프롬프트를 자주 활용합니다. 이 프롬프트들은 제가 업로드한 문서들을 기반으로 하기 때문에 항상 관련성이 높고, 생각의 물꼬를 터주는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다.\nNotebookLM과의 모든 채팅은 하나의 노트가 되고, 다시 하나의 소스가 될 수 있습니다. 이건 마치 통찰력이 스스로 순환하며 여러분의 생각들이 데이지 체인처럼 연결되는 것과 같아요. 저에게는 바로 이 미묘한 기능이 저널링 과정을 완전히 바꿔놓았다고 생각합니다. 2026년인 현재, 이런 도구들을 통해 지식을 쌓는 것이 얼마나 즐거운 일인지 여러분도 꼭 경험해보시길 바랍니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 접지된 AI: NotebookLM은 내가 제공한 자료만으로 답변하여 환각 없이 정확한 정보를 제공합니다.\n✅ 개인화된 학습 저널: 노트를 통해 나만의 성찰과 아이디어를 추가하여 진정한 학습 저널을 만들 수 있습니다.\n✅ 효율적인 학습 루틴: 20분 내외의 짧은 성찰 시간과 ELI5, FAQ 프롬프트로 깊이 있는 이해를 돕습니다.\n✅ 지속적인 지식 성장: 주간 학습 가이드 및 플래시카드 검토로 아이디어를 신선하게 유지하고 지식 체계를 확장합니다.\n이제 여러분도 NotebookLM과 함께 흩어진 자료를 나만의 강력한 인사이트로 만들어 보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: NotebookLM 학습 저널링의 가장 큰 장점은 무엇인가요?\nA1: NotebookLM은 사용자가 업로드한 자료만을 기반으로 작동하여, AI의 답변이 항상 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있다는 점이 가장 큰 장점입니다.

data-ke-size=\"size16\">인프콘을 한번 하는데 필요한 회사적 에너지나 자본이 현재 시기에서는 투입하기 어려울 정도로 높다.<br />그만큼 올 한해가 회사적으로 정말 집중해야할 시기가 되었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">다만, 한번도 인프콘을 경험하지 못한 신규 입사자들의 입장에서 기대감을 꺾은 것 같아서 죄송했다.<br />회사가 좋은 실적을 내고 나서 성대하게 하자고 이야기 드렸다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">결정은 1월에 했지만, 서비스 공지는 6월에 했다.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li><a

data-ke-size=\"size20\">베트남 &amp; 일본 시장</h4>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">영어에 이어 일본어, 베트남어로도 인프런을 사용할 수 있도록 국제화가 확장 되었다.<br />베트남은 국내의 대기업들이 앞다투어 소프트웨어 센터를 확장하고 있는 국가이다.<br />국내 대비 낮은 개발자 몸값과 근면성실한 사람들, 한국과 비슷한 가치관등으로 대기업들이 개발자를 확보하기 좋은 환경이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">한국 대기업들의 복지, 처우가 좋기에 베트남의 개발자들에겐 미국의 빅테크 다음으로 입사하기 좋은 기업들로 평가 받는다는 이야기를 들었다.<br />그래서 한국의 소프트웨어 개발 방법론을 배우고자 하는 예비 개발자, 경력 개발자들이 많기에 우리의 개발 강의들이 충분히 수요가 있다고 봤다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">영어, 일본어, 베트남어, 한국어를 포함한 4개 국어로 서비스를 사용할 수 있게 되어 본격적으로 글로벌 시장 확장을 시도할 수 있게 되었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">유니티, 언리얼과 같은 게임 개발과 자바/스프링으로 진행되는 JVM 백엔드 분야는 세계 어디와 비교해봐도 국내 개발자 분들이 경쟁력이 있다.<br />그리고 이 2개는 국내에서 우리보다 더 좋은 콘텐츠를 가진 회사가 없기에 글로벌은 이쪽 부분에서 가능성이 있다고 봤다.</p>\n<h4 data-ke-size=\"size20\">완전한 오픈 플랫폼 전환 시작</h4>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">국내 시장이 워낙 작기에 버티컬로 1등을 했다면, 그 분야를 중심으로 확장해나가지 않으면 안된다.<br />우린 국내에서 개발/프로그래밍에 한해서 1등이지만 그것만으로는 시장의 크기가 너무 작다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>개발/프로그래밍 분야로 글로벌 확장</li>\n<li>개발/프로그래밍 분야 외 넓은 카테고리로 국내 시장을 확장</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">투 트랙 전략을 취하기로 결정하고 사내에 공유했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">국내에서는 타 교육 서비스들처럼 MD/PD 가 제작에 강력히 참여하는 형태가 아닌 <b>완전한 오픈 플랫폼으로 카테고리 확장</b>을 해야만 한다고 봤다.<br />카테고리 확장을 시도하되, 기존 서비스들처럼 MD/PD의 관여가 필요한 형태로는 해서는 안된다고 생각했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">MD/PD 주도하에 콘텐츠 생성하는 방향은 절대적인 단점들이 존재한다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"콘텐츠 출시 속도가 MD/PD 의 인원수에 비례한다는 것\"<br />\"해당 분야의 지식이 있는 MD/PD가 없다면 사실상 해당 콘텐츠 출시가 어렵다는 것\"</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>일정 궤도에 오른 스타트업에서는 사람에 비례하는 속도로 성장하는 방향은 절대 하면 안된다</b>는 생각을 갖고 있다.<br />스타트업으로서 계속 폭발력을 가지려면 사람에 비례하지 않는 성장 방향으로 결과를 내야한다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그러기 위해서 콘텐츠, 교육 서비스 치고는 드물게 전체 인원의 50%를 프로덕트 조직 (PM/디자인/개발) 으로 구성하고 있었다.<br />폭발력은 제품력과 기술력이 있어야만 하고, 그게 경쟁사 대비 우리가 갖는 큰 장점이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">결국 유튜브나 인스타처럼 누구나 콘텐츠 기획자/MD의 관여 없이 출시할 수 있는 완전한 오픈 플랫폼으로 제공하는 것을 목표로 삼았다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>내가 갖고 있는 지식을 나누고 싶을때 언제든 나누고 배풀 수 있는 자율성과 접근성을 가지되, 문제가 될만한 여지가 있는 콘텐츠는 자동으로 걸러낼 수 있는 시스템을 갖춘 플랫폼</b>.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 목표를 위해 전사 프로젝트를 띄었다.<br />프로젝트 이름은 A,B,C,D 다음인 E로 시작하는 Eren Yeager (에렌 예거)로 삼았다.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"에렌.png\"

수단들 (네이버페이, 토스페이) 은 직연동으로 전환하기 시작했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">토스페이먼츠의 결제위젯은 결제수단 하나하나를 연동하는데 들어가는 공수를 줄여주는 아주 좋은 결제 플랫폼이다.<br />우리 같이 별도의 결제/정산 팀을 구축할 여력이 없는 팀에게는 결제위젯이 주는 운영/도입 편의성이 크다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">다만, 그럼에도 아쉬운 점이 많았는데, 직연동에 비해 각 결제수단들의 혜택을 100% 활용할 수가 없었다.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>직연동이 아니면 후불결제(BNPL)를 사용할 수가

유저들을 붙잡는게 중요하다 생각했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">네이버페이에서도 직연동에 대한 프로모션을 지원해주셔서 좋은 결제 혜택을 유저분들께 제공할 수 있었다.</p>\n<h4 data-ke-size=\"size20\">아기 유니콘</h4>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">카린의 하드캐리로 정부에서

거절했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">예전부터 선비는 조직이 항상 단단하게 기반을 다지는 것의 중요성을 얘기했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">반대로 나는 언제 어느때든 없어질 수 있는 것이 스타트업이고, 2년뒤, 3년뒤에 지금보다 더 서비스가 커질지 아예 축소될지 알 수 없기 때문에 미리 기반을 단단하게 작업하는 것에 대해서 이르다는 생각을 전달했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">뿐만 아니라 서비스 전체의 기반이 되는 플랫폼을 전환하는 것이 얼마나 큰 작업인지 알기에 DevOps의 리소스를 거기에 몇달간 투자하는 것은 큰 모험이였다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">우리 팀의 DevOps는 <b>비즈니스 구현을 제외한 모든 것을 하는 조직</b>이다.<br />DevOps, SRE로서의 역할을 하는 것은 물론, DBA/네트워크 엔지니어/보안팀, 더 나아가서는 사내 인터넷 관리, 출/퇴근 기기 관리, 아틀라시안과 같은 사내 SaaS 관리를 하는 IT 서비스팀으로서의 역할, 각종 서비스에 들어가는 AI의 코어 구현까지 하는 AI 엔지니어로서의 역할도 함께 한다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그러다보니 전체 개발자 30명 중 6명(20%) 을 DevOps로 둘 정도로 비중으로는 높게 있어도 항상 리소스가 부족하다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">EKS로의 전환 보다는 더 비즈니스에 필요한 역할에 에너지를 쏟기 위해 계속해서 EKS로의 전환을 반대했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">내가 거절할때마다 선비는 더 조사하고, 더 공부하고, 더 숙련도를 높여서 더 나은 제안을 가져왔다.<br /><b>본인 혼자서 해도 전체 인프라를 EKS로 전환하는데 2달 이내로 끝낼 수 있다</b>는 확신이 들었을 때 선비는 한번 더 제안을 했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">난 선비보다 EKS 전환에 대해 깊게 고민하는 사람이 아니였기에 선비 같은 판단력을 가진 사람이 이정도로 고민하고 준비했다면 그러면 밀어주는게 맞다고 생각했다.</p>\n<blockquote data-ke-style=\"style2\">\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">과거에도 IaC를 발전시켜나가는 과정에서 난 Terraform을 가능하면 계속 유지하자는 쪽이였고, 선비는 Pulumi로 전환하자는 파였는데, 결국 선비의 말이 맞았다.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">물론 특정 개인이 열심히 했으니 노력에 대한 보상 차원에서 허락한다는 그런 유치한 감정은 아니다.<br /><b>조직과 서비스에 결국 +효과가 얼마나 크냐가 항상 기준이였고, 선비의 마지막 제안 시점은 비용 절감이 핵심과제</b>가 될 때였다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이미 우리는 S3, CDN, RDB 에서는 줄일만큼 줄였다.<br />더 줄일 여력은 EC2 쪽이였다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">EKS로 전환이 완료되면</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>Karpenter 를 통한 극단적인 EC2 효율화</li>\n<li>서비스 매시로 인한 private 로드밸런서들의 정리</li>\n<li>VPC/서브넷 정리</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">등등으로 큰 비용효과를 볼 수 있었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">뿐만 아니라 완전한 GitOps 환경 전환, <a href=\"https://tech.inflab.com/20251121-pr-preview/\">PR Preview 도입</a>과 같은 전체 제품 출시 과정의 개선을 위해선 꼭 필요했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">다만, 선비는 혼자서 가능하다고 했지만 조직적으로는 선비가 혼자서 100% 하는 것은 진행과정에서도, 완료 이후에도 리스크가 크다고 판단했다.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>선비가 갑자기 아프면 EKS 전환 과정 전체가 멈추게 되는 리스크</li>\n<li>전환 이후에 선비가 부재이면 관리할 수 있는 사람이 없다는 리스크</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">등등.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 제이스와 함께해서 2명이서 2달 이내로 전환하는 것으로 결정하고 나머지 조슈아, 제이크, 구피, 포카가 최대한 커버하기로 했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">선비, 제이스는 DevOps 내에서도 운영 티켓을 많이 처리하던 사람이였기에 이 시기에 구피, 포카가 운영 업무 숙련도를 쌓는 계기가 되기를 원한 것도 있었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">약속대로 선비는 제이스와 함께 6월에 EKS 전환을 완료했다.<br />특별히 큰 장애 없이, 무중단으로 말이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">EKS 전환이 완료됨으로 AWS 비용이 크게 개선되었다.<br />EC2/로드밸런서/VPC/서브넷에서 감소되는 비용이 높아서 1월 대비해서 연말에는 거의 30%가 절감되었다.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"aws.jpeg\" data-origin-width=\"1122\"

이야기는 입사했던 2021년부터 계속 있었던 주제였다.<br />콘텐츠, 교육이라는 도메인에서 결국은 기업, 단체에서 원하는 것은 <b>예상 가능한 교육비</b>였고, 그런 의미에서 단건 결제 (실비 정산) 방식은 교육비를 예상하기 힘들다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">구독제가 없다는 것이 B2B Sales에서 항상 병목이였단걸 알지만, 쉽사리 도입하진 못했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">한 건이 판매가 되면 전체 강의 금액을 수취할 수 있는 것과 별개로 구독제는 재생시간에 비례해서 수강생의 구독료를 1/N 하는 방식이다.<br />한 건의 판매로 온전히 수강료를 수취하는 것이 아니라, 수강을 해도 당장엔 적은 금액만 수취할 수 밖에 없다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그러다보니 지식공유자분들께 진짜 도움이 되는 비즈니스 모델인지에 대한 고민이 많았다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>강의 학습 데이터를 확인하고, 좋은 콘텐츠는 수료 이후에도 계속 반복 학습 한다는 것을 알게 됐다.</b><br />한 사람에게 5만원의 강의를 판매하고 이후에는 더이상 수익이 없는 것과 한 사람이 재생할때마다 일정 수익이 계속해서 발생하는 것을 생각해봤다.<br />콘텐츠를 재생할때마다 계속 수익이 가능하니 시간이 길어질수록 더 높은 누적 수익을 드릴 수 있는 방법이였다.<br />구독제도 수강생/지식공유자 모두에게 이득이 될 수 있다는 확신이 생겨서 프로젝트를 시작하게 됐다.</p>\n<p

않았다.<br />그래서 고정비에서 가장 크게 차지하는 것은 거주비였다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">배민때부터 계속 송파구(잠실, 석촌, 송파등) 에서 거주했다.<br />10년 가까이 지낸 동네를 떠나기 싫어서 가능한 송파구 안에서 거주비를 줄이고 싶었다.<br />근데 한계가 있었다.</p>\n<p

중요했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이때 오판이 있었다.<br />챌린지 라는 서비스의 시작은 <a href=\"https://www.inflearn.com/tag-curation/common_tag/inflearn-warmup-club\">워밍업 클럽</a> 이다.<br />여기에 정환님과 같은 지식공유자분들의 인터뷰를 추가 참고했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 초기 MVP에서 풀어내야할 Problem을 \"워밍업 클럽처럼 MD가 운영하는 것이 아닌 <b>지식 공유자분들이 본인의 강의로 직접 기수제를 운영</b>하도록 하자\" 로 잡았다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">워밍업 클럽을 통해 수강생분들이 지식 공유자분과 함께 하는 참여형 교육에 대해 니즈가 높다는 건 검증이 된 상태였으니 이쪽으로 방향을 게속 잡고 있었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">기존 강의가 있다는 가정하에 기획하다보니 <b>기존 강의가 없는 사람은 챌린지를 개설하는 것은 배제</b>한채 시작을 했는데 이게 초기 MVP의 오판이였다.<br />매 주마다 진도를 체크하고 수강을 독려하는 것이 쉬운 일이 아니기 때문에 한정된 자원으로 VOD 촬영과 질문/답변을 해주는 것에만 집중하는 것을 원하시는 지식 공유자분들이 훨씬 많았다.<br />오히려 외부에서 라이브 스트리밍과 디스코드/슬랙으로 코호트 교육을 운영하시는 분들의 니즈가 훨씬 높았다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 MVP 출시후 곧바로 기존에 인프런 강의가 없는 분들도 챌린지를 개설할 수 있는 방향으로 빠르게 확장했다.<br />강의가 없어도 라이브 스트리밍으로 충분히 코스를 운영하실 수 있는 분들의 참여로 콘텐츠가 빠르게 늘어났다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">런칭한지 얼마되지 않은 서비스가 이렇게 빨리 회사의 주요 서비스가 된 이례적인

선정</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4 data-ke-size=\"size20\">챌린지 라이브 기능 추가</h4>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">챌린지가 코호트 교육으로 제대로 자리 잡기 위해선 라이브 스트리밍 기능이 필요했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">스타트업답게 유튜브 라이브나 Zoom등을 활용한 방법도 있겠지만, 임시방편으로 쓸 순 있어도 챌린지에서만큼은 쓰면 안된다 생각했다.<br />크게 3가지 이유 때문이였다.</p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>일관된 교육 경험</li>\n<li>MD에 의존하지 않은 콘텐츠</li>\n<li>채팅/스트리밍 데이터의 유실</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">챌린지 내 VOD 강의를 듣다가 라이브가 시작되면 Zoom이나 Google Meet으로 이동했다가, 라이브가 끝나면 다시 인프런 강의실로 오고 가는 과정은 너무 불편하다고 생각했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">더군다나 챌린지를 운영하시는 지식 공유자분들이 어떤 라이브 스트리밍 도구를 쓰는지에 따라 수강생분들은 그것들 전체를 다 설치해야만 한다.<br />PC/모바일 모두에 말이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A 지식공유자분은 Zoom 으로 라이브를 하고<br />B 지식공유자분은 Google Meet으로 라이브를 하고<br />C 지식공유자분은 Discord로 라이브를 한다면<br />그 과정들을 모두 듣는 수강생은 해당 서비스 전체가 다 설치되어있어야만 한다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">유튜브 라이브로 단일화 해서 한다고 하면 우리 운영 팀에서 모든 라이브에 관여해서 운영해야하는데 그러면 결국 인력수에 비례한 서비스 성장 방법이기 때문에 이걸 선택해선 안된다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">각종 화상 회의 도구에 흩어진 채팅 데이터나 스트리밍 데이터가 유실되는 것도 장기적으로 큰 문제라고 생각했다.<br />해당 라이브를 못본 사람들은 녹화된 영상도, 당시의 나눈 대화도 전혀 보지 못하는 상황이 발생하기 때문이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">챌린지와 전혀 무관한 커리어 Cell에게 해당 프로젝트를 맡겼다.<br />이미 다른 Cell이 모두 회사의 비즈니스와 관련된 프로젝트를 진행중이였기 때문에 마케팅 파트너스에 이어 챌린지 라이브를 맡았다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><a href=\"https://www.100ms.live/\">100ms</a> 를 활용해 라이브를 구현했다.<br />라이브 내 채팅을 구현하지 않고, 라이브와 채팅을 별도로 나눠서 구현했다.<br />기존에 갖고 있던 채팅 서비스를 함께 활용했다.<br />라이브와 채팅을 별도로 나눠 구현했기 때문에 라이브가 없어도 채팅에 참여가능하고 기록이 남았다.<br />라이브 시작 전, 종료 후, 라이브 일정이 없을때 등등 채팅에 참여할 수 있어서 만족도가 다들 높으셨다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">라이브 스트리밍 기능이 추가됨에 따라 각종 1회성 라이브 챌린지가 개설되었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">신규 강의 홍보를 위한 온라인 라이브를 비롯해 도서 챌린지에서 저자와의 라이브토크 등 다양한 형태로 챌린지를 활용하기 시작했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이후 진행될 완강 챌린지의 근간이 되었다.</p>\n<h4 data-ke-size=\"size20\">위기 공유</h4>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">전사에 위기 상황을 PPT로 작성해서 공유했다.<br />이번의 대상은 프로덕트 조직이기에 발표 준비를 직접 하고 전사 공유도 직접했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>나와 쭈의 급여를 30% 삭감하기로 했다</b>.<br />(지금은 실적이 회복되어서 다시 원복했다.)<br />10~12월의 흑자 전환이 어려울때 더 줄일만한 것들이 있어야 하는데 그때 가장 먼저 남은 70%의 급여를 줄이기로 했다.<br />이것 역시 전사에 공유드렸다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이미 어느정도 상황을 예상하신 분들도 계셨지만 그럼에도 전사에 큰 충격이 되었다.<br />누구누구가 대상인지를 공유드리진 못하고, 한분 한분 면담때 말씀드린다고 하니 다들 불안에 빠졌다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">내가 무너지지 않을까 쭈가 걱정을 많이 했다.<br />제품팀과의 면담을 본인이 직접 해도 된다는 이야기도 해줬다.<br />다만, 그 이야기를 내 입으로 전하지 못하면 내 인생은 거기서 끝날 것 같았다.<br /><b>좋을때는 직접 얘기하고, 안좋을때는 대표/HR 뒤로 숨는 리더에게 누가 신뢰를 줄 수 있겠나</b>.<br />천하의 악당이 되는 것도 내가 해야할 몫이여야 했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">44명의 모든 제품팀 인원과 1on1을 진행했다.<br />함께 할 수 있는지 아닌지에 대해 이야기를 드렸다.<br />짧게는 1시간, 길게는 2시간씩.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">여전히 마음이 있는 몇년간 만난 연인에게 헤어지자는 이야기를 한번 하려면 몇달을 고민한다.<br />그건 아무리해도 익숙해지지 않는다.<br />그걸 짧은 시간에 너무 많은 사람과 했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">아무리 해도 입이 잘 떨어지지 않았다.<br />드라이하게 해야한다고 정말 많은 조언을 들었지만, 막상 상대의 얼굴을 보면 면접때부터 닥터때까지 달려오던 그 시간들이 떠올라서 말이 안나왔다.<br />꾸역꾸역 면담을 다 완료했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">헤어지기로한 인원들 이외에도 퇴사하겠다는 팀원들이 다수 발생했다.<br />특히 3~5년 이상 근속한 오래된 팀원들이 다수 추가 이탈했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">우리팀이 갖고 있는 강점이자 약점이 동료애다.<br />충분히 더 여건이 좋은 회사를 갈 수 있음에도 함께하는 동료들이 워낙 좋기에 다른 회사를 찾아보지 않고 3~5년씩 다닌 사람들이 많았다.<br />그런 동료들과 더이상 함께 하지 못하게 되었을 때 예상보다 훨씬 더 많은 인원이 자발적 퇴사를 했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">예상한 것보다 많은 팀원들이 추가로 이탈하게 되어서 <b>재무적으로는 안정적이게 되었지만 심리적으로는 불안정하게 되었다</b>.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">자발적 퇴사는 9월에서 끝나지 않고, 10, 11, 12월까지 계속 이어졌다.<br />(이 글을 쓰는 시점엔 프로덕트 인원은 30명, 전체 팀원은 50명이 되었다.)</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">단단한 프로덕트 조직을 일궈낸 것에 자부심을 갖고 있었지만, 이때만큼은 스스로를 계속 의심했다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">헤어져야할 팀원들의 인원수를 확정짓는데 너무 오랜 시간이 걸렸다.<br />8월까지의 재무제표와 앞으로의 비용에 관해 전부 계산되었음에도 <br />\"이렇게하면 이만큼은 더 같이 갈 수 있지 않을까\", <br />\"저 제품이 이렇게 성과를 내면 이만큼은 더 같이 갈 수 있지 않을까\" 등등.<br /><b>미련한 희망을 갖고 계속 계산했다</b>.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">회사와 팀원 전체를 두고 1% 확률의 도박에 참여하려는 것 같다는 생각을 했다.<br />지금 해야하는 건 도박이 아니라 확실한 생존인데도 말이다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">9월엔 어떤 프로젝트를 진행하거나 완료하기 힘들 정도로 붕 떠있는 채로 한달을 보냈다.<br />그 시간이 너무 아까웠다.<br />그렇지만, 무언갈 할 수 있는 상황은 아니였다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">팀 내 자발적 퇴사가 멈출것 같지 않은 분위기가 계속 됐다.</p>\n<h3

새로운 역할을 부여받으면 그 역할을 잘하기 위해 다양한 학습을 해서 조직 전체에 활기를 심어줄 것 같았다.<br />더군다나 프론트엔드 개발자 출신의 PM 이 가지고 있는 강점을 충분히 알고 있어서 한번 시도해봐도 되겠다 싶었다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">럭끼는 PM 역할 자체에 충분히 흥미를 갖고 있었기에 빠르게 PM에게

위한 시장으로 더 커질 것으로 생각한다.\n다만, 장기적으로는 앞으로가 더 기회가 많을 것 같다고 보지만, 당장의 눈 앞의 시장 반응은 개발 교육, 성인 교육 시장의 위기로 보고 있으니 그에 대한 대응책이 필요했다.\n그래서 올해를 플랫폼 확장의 시작으로 잡았다.\n영문 페이지 + 페이팔 오픈\n2024년 동안 진행했던 글로벌 전환 프로젝트 (a.k.a

앞다투어 소프트웨어 센터를 확장하고 있는 국가이다.\n국내 대비 낮은 개발자 몸값과 근면성실한 사람들, 한국과 비슷한 가치관등으로 대기업들이 개발자를 확보하기 좋은 환경이다.\n한국 대기업들의 복지, 처우가 좋기에 베트남의 개발자들에겐 미국의 빅테크 다음으로 입사하기 좋은 기업들로 평가 받는다는 이야기를 들었다.\n그래서 한국의 소프트웨어 개발 방법론을 배우고자 하는 예비 개발자, 경력 개발자들이 많기에 우리의 개발 강의들이 충분히 수요가 있다고 봤다.\n영어, 일본어, 베트남어, 한국어를 포함한 4개 국어로 서비스를 사용할 수 있게 되어 본격적으로 글로벌 시장 확장을 시도할 수 있게 되었다.\n유니티, 언리얼과 같은 게임 개발과 자바/스프링으로 진행되는 JVM 백엔드 분야는 세계 어디와 비교해봐도 국내 개발자 분들이 경쟁력이 있다.\n그리고 이 2개는 국내에서 우리보다 더 좋은 콘텐츠를 가진 회사가 없기에 글로벌은 이쪽 부분에서 가능성이 있다고 봤다.\n완전한 오픈 플랫폼 전환 시작\n국내 시장이 워낙 작기에 버티컬로 1등을 했다면, 그 분야를 중심으로 확장해나가지 않으면 안된다.\n우린 국내에서 개발/프로그래밍에 한해서 1등이지만 그것만으로는 시장의

서비스들처럼 MD/PD의 관여가 필요한 형태로는 해서는 안된다고 생각했다.\nMD/PD 주도하에 콘텐츠 생성하는 방향은 절대적인 단점들이 존재한다.\n\"콘텐츠 출시 속도가 MD/PD 의 인원수에 비례한다는 것\"\n\"해당 분야의 지식이 있는 MD/PD가 없다면 사실상 해당 콘텐츠 출시가 어렵다는 것\"\n일정 궤도에 오른 스타트업에서는 사람에 비례하는 속도로 성장하는 방향은 절대 하면 안된다는 생각을 갖고 있다.\n스타트업으로서 계속 폭발력을 가지려면 사람에 비례하지 않는 성장 방향으로 결과를 내야한다.\n그러기 위해서 콘텐츠, 교육 서비스 치고는 드물게 전체 인원의 50%를 프로덕트 조직 (PM/디자인/개발) 으로 구성하고 있었다.\n폭발력은 제품력과 기술력이 있어야만 하고, 그게 경쟁사 대비 우리가 갖는 큰 장점이다.\n결국 유튜브나 인스타처럼 누구나 콘텐츠 기획자/MD의 관여 없이 출시할 수 있는 완전한 오픈 플랫폼으로 제공하는 것을 목표로 삼았다.\n내가 갖고 있는 지식을 나누고 싶을때 언제든 나누고 배풀 수 있는 자율성과 접근성을 가지되, 문제가 될만한 여지가 있는 콘텐츠는 자동으로 걸러낼 수 있는 시스템을 갖춘 플랫폼.\n이 목표를 위해 전사 프로젝트를 띄었다.\n프로젝트 이름은 A,B,C,D 다음인 E로 시작하는 Eren Yeager (에렌 예거)로 삼았다.\n\n\n2월의 실적\n2월의 실적이 생각보다 좋지 않았다.\nBun Rate를 보면서 쭈와 이야기하는 빈도수가 점점 늘기 시작했다.\n\n\n3월\n식물 키우기 오픈\n멘토링 상세 페이지 UI/UX 개선\n미션 기능 오픈\n로드맵 강의실 기능 오픈\n비인증 결제 추가\n채팅 서비스 오픈\n전사의 방향성이 정해지고, 기대하던 글로벌 전환도 끝나서 본격적으로 다시금 제품 고도화에 속도를 냈다.\n식물 키우기\n많은 앱 서비스들이 하는 XX키우기류를 인프런 앱에도 추가했다.\n인프런은 개인의 성장을 돕는 서비스이기 때문에 학습+자라나는 나무를 컨셉으로 잡았다.\n\n\n또우와 율무가 베타 시연을 해주는데 너무 이쁘게 잘나와서 다 같이 신나했다.\n빨리 이거 런칭하자고 주변에서 먼저 난리였다.\n인프런은 어떤 서비스인가를 굳이 대놓고 어필하기 보다는 이렇게 자연스럽게 버튼 하나, 기능 하나에서 느껴지게 하는 것이 좋은 제품 브랜딩이라고 생각한다.\n그런면에서 강의를 구매한 만큼이 아니라 학습한 만큼 나무가 자란다는 컨셉은 지금 봐도 브랜드 톤을 잘 유지한 방향성이라고 느꼈다.\n교육 플랫폼\n콘텐츠 커머스가 아닌 교육 플랫폼이라는 것을 체감하시는 고객분들의 SNS 코멘트가 늘어났다.\n\n\n자주 트위터에 인프런을 검색하게 됐다.\n3월 실적\n1분기 실적을 결산했다.\n2023, 2024와 비교해서 올해 1분기 실적이 가장 안좋았다.\n2년전 보다 못한 분기 실적을 달성하는 스타트업의 C레벨은 스물스물 비용 절감을 먼저 떠올린다는걸 체감하게 되었다.\n영업이익을 많이 남겨 현금 흐름이 괜찮지만 성장성은 포기한 기업을 스타트업이라고 부를 순 없다는 생각을 했다.\n비용 절감은 계속 뒤로 미루고 애써 실적을 더 키울 방법에 대해서 계속 더 고민했다.\n4월\nVlad Mihalcea 님의 강의 오픈\n멘토링 목록 UI/UX 개선\nAI 퀴즈 오픈\n강의실 자동 메세지 기능 추가\nVlad님 강의 오픈\n자바 챔피언이자 하이버네이트 메인 기여자인 Vlad Mihalcea 님의 강의를 런칭했다.\n\n\n예전의 인연 때문에 Vlad님의 강의를 항상 주변에 많이들 추천했다.\n그럼에도 생소한 플랫폼, 한국어 미지원 등으로 시작하기 어려웠다.\n인프런이 국제화가 끝나면 가장 먼저 소개해주고 싶었다.\n다행히 Vlad님과 협업을 하게 되어 한국, 일본, 베트남 모두에게 강의를 소개해줄 수 있게 되었다.\n루나, 애시, 오뜨, 제나, 제이크와 함께 단기 TF를 구성해서 짬짬이 시간내서 이벤트와 함께 강의를 오픈했다.\nMD, 마케팅, 콘텐츠 디자인, 개발 4개 직군이 사이드 프로젝트처럼 진행했을때의 파괴력을 봤다.\n높은 목표를 가지고 달렸는데, 그 목표보다 더 높은 성과가 나와서 그 과정을 전사에 공유했다.\nAI 퀴즈\n자막, 번역, 더빙에 이어 AI를 활용한 자동 퀴즈 생성 기능을 런칭했다.\n학습-성장의 루프에서는 결국 검증 이 필요한데, 이걸 지식 공유자분들이 직접 생성하고 관리하시기에는 너무 귀찮은 일이 될 것 같았다.\n일단 내가 지식공유자 입장이라도 매 섹션마다 퀴즈를 만들어야 한다면 만들지 않을 것 같았다.\n그래서 퀴즈와 같은 것들은 AI가 자동으로 만들어주는 것이 좋다고 판단했다.\n또한 지식공유자분들이 직접 퀴즈 내용을 수정하고 답안을 수정하는 기능도 넣지 않기로 했다.\n생성, 수정 기능을 넣게되면 출시 일정을 늦춰야하는 것도 있었지만, 그 기능을 거의 사용하지 않을 것 같았다.\n퀴즈 내용에 오류가 있고, 잘못이 있다면 그건 그걸 만들어낸 플랫폼이 책임지고 대응하면 되는 일이고 그래야만 지식 공유자분들의 부담이 줄 것 같았다.\n만약 직접 수정하셔야하는 상황으로 가게 되면 오히려 다 OFF 해달라고 할 수도 있다고 생각했다.\n지식 공유는 쉽고 편해야하는데, 자꾸 뭔가 해야하는 허들이 높아지면 카테고리 확장이라는 목표를 달성할 수 없다고 봤다.\n강의 내용에 대한 이해를 평가하는 것 그 이상, 좀 더 생각할거리를 주는 그런류의 질문을 수강생에게 던지는 것이 지식 공유자분들의 몫이라고 생각했다.\n그리고 그건 이후에 출시할 미션 기능으로 해소해야한다고 봤다.\n그래서 지식공유자분들이 퀴즈를 생성하고, 수정하는 것은 초기 스펙에 넣지 않고 AI가 만들어내는 퀴즈의 퀄리티와 답변의 정확도를 높이는데 에너지를 많이 들였다.\n담당자인 구피가 엄청 많은 공을 들였다.\n구피의 경우 DevOps로 입사했는데, 회사의 사정상 AI를 활용한 기능 개발의 중심역할을 하다보니 본인의 역할에 대한 고민을 정말 많이 했었다.\n그럼에도 한번 맡은 역할에 대한 책임감이 대단히 뛰어나서 정말 좋은 퀄리티로 퀴즈 생성 엔진을 구현해주셨다.\n\n\n자동 메세지\n에렌의 여러 과제 중 하나인 자동 메세지가 런칭되었다.\n지식 공유자분들이 원하는 상황일 때 원하는 형태의 메세지를 노출 시켜줄 수 있는 것은 굉장히 큰 무기이다.\n유튜브의 우측 상단에 특정 시점에 클릭가능한 메세지를 노출시키는 것처럼 인프런 내에서도 활용할 수 있게 해준다.\n영상을 따라가다가 자주 실수하는 지점에서 실수할 부분을 미리 안내해주시기도 하고, 특정 소프트웨어 설치시 버전 이슈가 될 것 같으면 그에 대한 해결책 링크를 노출시키기도 한다.\n활용도가 너무나 높기에 꼭 해야할 프로젝트라고 봤다.\n진행 담당자인 학습 독려 Cell에서 많은 고민을 했던 프로젝트였다.\n이걸 왜 해야하느냐부터 꼭 강의실 내 노출로 가야하느냐, 꼭 이런 컨셉이어야 하느냐 등등 굉장히 다양한 의견이 있었다.\n로마 격투장과 같은 토론의 장이 열리기도 했다.\n(잘 지내시죠 빠삐코....?)\n논의는 길었지만, 결정이 되고나서 런칭까지는 빠르게 완료 되었다.\n런칭 후 정환님이 극찬해주셨다.\n\n\n4월 실적\n만우절 천원샵, 전사할인, 영한님의 신규 강의 오픈, Vlad님의 강의 오픈 등 여러 겹경사가 겹쳐 높은 실적이 나왔다.\n2025년 통틀어 가장 높은 실적이였다.\n오랫만에 사내에 좋은 분위기가 흘렀다.\n5월\n강의 제작 여정 레거시 -> 신규 스택 (React/TS/Mantine) 완료\n네이버페이 직연동 전환\n앱 내 질문/답변 기능 추가\n아기유니콘 선정\n간편결제 직연동\n토스페이먼츠의 결제위젯을 유지한채 주요 결제 수단들 (네이버페이, 토스페이) 은 직연동으로 전환하기 시작했다.\n토스페이먼츠의 결제위젯은 결제수단 하나하나를 연동하는데 들어가는 공수를 줄여주는 아주 좋은 결제 플랫폼이다.\n우리 같이 별도의 결제/정산 팀을 구축할 여력이 없는 팀에게는 결제위젯이 주는 운영/도입 편의성이 크다.\n다만, 그럼에도 아쉬운 점이 많았는데, 직연동에 비해 각 결제수단들의 혜택을 100% 활용할 수가 없었다.\n직연동이 아니면 후불결제(BNPL)를 사용할 수가 없다.\n카드 + 머니/포인트와 같은 복합결제를 사용할 수 없다.\n각 간편결제사의 결제 혜택 프로모션을 지원 받기 어렵다.\n특히 법인카드나 교육비 환급이 지원되는 직장인 경우 1~5천원의 비용 초과로 강의 결제를 못하는 경우가 문제였다.\n카드로 5만원을 결제하고 나머지 소액은 충전형 머니/포인트로 결제하면 되는데 복합결제가 지원되지 않는 결제 위젯으로는 카드 or 머니/포인트로 밖에 할 수 없어서 위 같은 경우 계속해서 고객 이탈이 발생했다.\n운영/관리의 이슈가 발생하더라도 결제 이탈 유저들을 붙잡는게 중요하다 생각했다.\n네이버페이에서도 직연동에 대한 프로모션을 지원해주셔서 좋은 결제 혜택을 유저분들께 제공할 수 있었다.\n아기 유니콘\n카린의 하드캐리로 정부에서 선정한 아기유니콘이 되었다.\n\n\n우리 팀은 정부 과제와 심사에 능숙한 팀이 아니다.\n그래서 이런 정부의 지원 프로그램은 최대한 배제한채로 움직였는데, 아기 유니콘의 경우 워낙 선정의 가치가 크다보니 얻고 싶었다.\n그래서 그 전부터 아기유니콘 심사를 계속 신청했지만 번번이 떨어졌다.\n그러다 다양한 경험을 갖추고 있는 카린이 팀에 합류하면서 정부 프로그램에 대해서도 경쟁력을 갖출 수 있게 되었다.\n카린은 정부 프로그램뿐만 아니라 글로벌 콘텐츠 수급과 마케팅도 함께 하고 있다.\n스타트업에서 필요로 하는 다방면의 역량을 갖추고 있어서, 우리팀의 강력한 무기 중 하나라고 생각한다.\n무조건 대표자가 발표를 해야하다보니 어쩔 수 없이 쭈가 발표를 하게 됐다.\n긴장한 나머지 준비한 모든 발표를 전달하지 못해서 걱정이 많았는데, 진정성이 잘 전달된 것 같다.\n선정되고나서 대대적으로 공지사항으로 전체 팀원에게 공유하고 축하의 전사 간식 시간도 가졌다.\n\n\n5월 실적\n4월의 높은 실적, 아기유니콘 선정 등 좋은 소식이 계속 이어졌지만, 5월 실적이 매우 좋지 않았다.\n2022년 이후 최악의 실적이였다.\n이런 실적이 2번만 더 나오면 회사가 망할 수도 있을 정도였다.\n회사가 추구하는 극도의 투명함이 오히려 불안함을 더 증폭시키고 있다고 느꼈다.\n우리팀은 극도의 투명함을 지향하고 있기 때문에 전사의 재무제표를 모두에게 공개하고 있다.\nBun Rate 까지도 공개하고 있다.\n\n\n\n그러다보니 팀원들 모두가 현재 회사의 사정이 어떤지 다 알고 있었고 그로 인해 불안감이 스물스물 올라왔다.\n그렇기에 좋은 소식들을 지속적으로 공유하지 않으면 팀 전체가 불안감에 잡아먹힐 것 같았다.\n5월 매출이 결산된 6월엔 빠삐코를 중심으로 FE 개발자들끼리 회사가 돈을 벌려면 어떻게 해야할까에 대해 이야기를 나눴다는 것을 알게 됐다.\n\n\n쭈와 매주 함께하는 목요일 점심 식사 시간의 대화주제가 점점 변했다.\n성장, 플랫폼, 확장, 글로벌 -> BEP, Runway, 비용절감으로.\n쭈가 외부 미팅을 다녀온 뒤에 4분기 분기 흑자를 꼭 달성해야하는 상황이 되었음을 설명했다.\n남은 잉여현금으로는 18개월이상은 생존가능했지만, 이것과 상관없이 증명이 필요했다.\n4분기 분기 흑자 달성을 위해 필요한 것은 결국 비즈니스 모델의 확장이였다.\n좋은 학습 환경, 교육 플랫폼에 대한 개선은 잠깐 속도를 줄이고, 비즈니스 모델을 확장하는 프로젝트를 시작하게 됐다.\nB2B 구독제\n마케팅 파트너스 (어필리에이트 마케팅)\n챌린지\n플랫폼이 충분히 파괴력이 생기기 전까지는 비즈니스 모델을 계속 확장해나가는 걸 최대한 피하고 싶었다.\n그럼에도 더 미룰 수 있는 상황이 아니였기에 극단적인 일정 단축과 MVP 로 프로젝트를 시작하게 됐다.\n회사의 위기감에 모두가 동조된 상태라 R&R에 상관 없이 할 수 있는 여력이 있는 Cell이 각 프로젝트를 맡아서 진행했다.\n특히 랠릿과 멘토링을 담당하는 커리어 Cell이 마케팅 파트너스를 담당하게 됐을 때 조직적으로 아쉬워하는 것이 느껴져서 죄송했다.\nPM인 라떼가 최대한 긍정적으로 상황을 해석하고 Cell원분들을 달래주셨다.\n지난 시간 동안 우주, 라비, 하루 등의 퇴사와 협업 등을 경험하면서 라떼가 굉장히 단단해지셨다는게 느껴졌다.\n각 조직의 PM 분들을 믿고 온전히 실적과 고정비 절감에 대해서만 집중하기 시작했다.\n6월\nEKS 전환 완료\n앱 내 더빙 추가\nB2B 구독제 오픈\n랠릿 인재풀 오픈\n강의 개설 완전 자동화\nEKS 전환\n선비의 하드캐리로 ECS EC2 -> EKS로 전환이 완료되었다.\n올해 초부터 선비가 EKS로의 전환을 계속해서 제안했다.\n난 시기상조라고, ECS EC2를 최대한 더 길게 사용하자고 거절했다.\n예전부터 선비는 조직이 항상 단단하게 기반을 다지는 것의 중요성을 얘기했다.\n반대로 나는 언제 어느때든 없어질 수 있는 것이 스타트업이고, 2년뒤, 3년뒤에 지금보다 더 서비스가 커질지 아예 축소될지 알 수 없기 때문에 미리 기반을 단단하게 작업하는 것에 대해서 이르다는 생각을 전달했다.\n뿐만 아니라 서비스 전체의 기반이 되는 플랫폼을 전환하는 것이 얼마나 큰 작업인지 알기에 DevOps의 리소스를 거기에 몇달간 투자하는 것은 큰 모험이였다.\n우리 팀의 DevOps는 비즈니스 구현을 제외한 모든 것을 하는 조직이다.\nDevOps, SRE로서의 역할을 하는 것은 물론, DBA/네트워크 엔지니어/보안팀, 더 나아가서는 사내 인터넷 관리, 출/퇴근 기기 관리, 아틀라시안과 같은 사내 SaaS 관리를 하는 IT 서비스팀으로서의 역할, 각종 서비스에 들어가는 AI의 코어 구현까지 하는 AI 엔지니어로서의 역할도 함께 한다.\n그러다보니 전체 개발자 30명 중 6명(20%) 을 DevOps로 둘 정도로 비중으로는 높게 있어도 항상 리소스가 부족하다.\nEKS로의 전환 보다는 더 비즈니스에 필요한 역할에 에너지를 쏟기 위해 계속해서 EKS로의 전환을 반대했다.\n내가 거절할때마다 선비는 더 조사하고, 더 공부하고, 더 숙련도를 높여서 더 나은 제안을 가져왔다.\n본인 혼자서 해도 전체 인프라를 EKS로 전환하는데 2달 이내로 끝낼 수 있다는 확신이 들었을 때 선비는 한번 더 제안을 했다.\n난 선비보다 EKS 전환에 대해 깊게 고민하는 사람이 아니였기에 선비 같은 판단력을 가진 사람이 이정도로 고민하고 준비했다면 그러면 밀어주는게 맞다고 생각했다.\n과거에도 IaC를 발전시켜나가는 과정에서 난 Terraform을 가능하면 계속 유지하자는 쪽이였고, 선비는 Pulumi로 전환하자는 파였는데, 결국 선비의 말이 맞았다.\n물론 특정 개인이 열심히 했으니 노력에 대한 보상 차원에서 허락한다는 그런 유치한 감정은 아니다.\n조직과 서비스에 결국 +효과가 얼마나 크냐가 항상 기준이였고, 선비의 마지막 제안 시점은 비용 절감이 핵심과제가 될 때였다.\n이미 우리는 S3, CDN, RDB 에서는 줄일만큼 줄였다.\n더 줄일 여력은 EC2 쪽이였다.\nEKS로 전환이 완료되면\nKarpenter 를 통한 극단적인 EC2 효율화\n서비스 매시로 인한 private 로드밸런서들의 정리\nVPC/서브넷 정리\n등등으로 큰 비용효과를 볼 수 있었다.\n뿐만 아니라 완전한 GitOps 환경 전환, PR Preview 도입과 같은 전체 제품 출시 과정의 개선을 위해선 꼭 필요했다.\n다만, 선비는 혼자서 가능하다고 했지만 조직적으로는 선비가 혼자서 100% 하는 것은 진행과정에서도, 완료 이후에도 리스크가 크다고 판단했다.\n선비가 갑자기 아프면 EKS 전환 과정 전체가 멈추게 되는 리스크\n전환 이후에 선비가 부재이면 관리할 수 있는 사람이 없다는 리스크\n등등.\n그래서 제이스와 함께해서 2명이서 2달 이내로 전환하는 것으로 결정하고 나머지 조슈아, 제이크, 구피, 포카가 최대한 커버하기로 했다.\n선비, 제이스는 DevOps 내에서도 운영 티켓을 많이 처리하던 사람이였기에 이 시기에 구피, 포카가 운영 업무 숙련도를 쌓는 계기가 되기를 원한 것도 있었다.\n약속대로 선비는 제이스와 함께 6월에 EKS 전환을 완료했다.\n특별히 큰 장애 없이, 무중단으로 말이다.\nEKS 전환이 완료됨으로 AWS 비용이 크게 개선되었다.\nEC2/로드밸런서/VPC/서브넷에서 감소되는 비용이 높아서 1월 대비해서 연말에는 거의 30%가 절감되었다.\n\n\n쿠버네티스 환경으로 전환됨에 따라 특정 클라우드 벤더사에 종속되지 않고 다른 클라우드벤더, 온프레미스 환경까지도 쉽게 확장해서 쓸 수 있게 되었다.\nAI 자막, AI 더빙, (이후 진행된) AI썸네일, AI 강의소개 등을 모든 영상에다 작업하는 것은 큰 비용이 드는데 그럴때마다 클라우드 뿐만 아니라 온프레미스에서도 저렴한 GPU 서버를 구할 수 있을때마다 클러스터를 확장해서 저렴하게 AI 작업들을 수행했다.\n내 우려와 달리 이번에도 선비가 맞았다.\n선비는 항상 스스로 증명하는 사람이라서 매번 감사하다.\nB2B 구독제\nB2B 구독제를 런칭했다.\n단건 결제 (실비 정산)만 가능했던 B2B 서비스를 확장해서 기업이 구독으로도 인프런 교육을 들을 수 있도록 비즈니스 모델을 확장했다.\n구독제에 관한 이야기는 입사했던 2021년부터 계속 있었던 주제였다.\n콘텐츠, 교육이라는 도메인에서 결국은 기업, 단체에서 원하는 것은 예상 가능한 교육비였고, 그런 의미에서 단건 결제 (실비 정산) 방식은 교육비를 예상하기 힘들다.\n구독제가 없다는 것이 B2B Sales에서 항상 병목이였단걸 알지만, 쉽사리 도입하진 못했다.\n한 건이 판매가 되면 전체 강의 금액을 수취할 수 있는 것과 별개로 구독제는 재생시간에 비례해서 수강생의 구독료를 1/N 하는 방식이다.\n한 건의 판매로 온전히 수강료를 수취하는 것이 아니라, 수강을 해도 당장엔 적은 금액만 수취할 수 밖에 없다.\n그러다보니 지식공유자분들께 진짜 도움이 되는 비즈니스 모델인지에 대한 고민이 많았다.\n강의 학습 데이터를 확인하고, 좋은 콘텐츠는 수료 이후에도 계속 반복 학습 한다는 것을 알게 됐다.\n한 사람에게 5만원의 강의를 판매하고 이후에는 더이상 수익이 없는 것과 한 사람이 재생할때마다 일정 수익이 계속해서 발생하는 것을 생각해봤다.\n콘텐츠를 재생할때마다 계속 수익이 가능하니 시간이 길어질수록 더 높은 누적 수익을 드릴 수 있는 방법이였다.\n구독제도 수강생/지식공유자 모두에게 이득이 될 수 있다는 확신이 생겨서 프로젝트를 시작하게 됐다.\n프로젝트의 중심 축은 정산에 두었다.\n어떤 방식으로 재생 시간을 추적하고\n측정된 재생 시간을 기반으로 어떻게 정산해줄 것인가\n이 2가지가 핵심이였기에 구독제 TF는 정산 PM인 로이와 강의 플레이어 PM인 보니를 중심으로 두고 진행했다.\n런칭 이후 여러 부트캠프와 KDT 교육 업체에서 기수별 구독을 가입해서 이용하길 원하셨다.\n요 최근 2년간 런칭했던 프로젝트 중 비즈니스 임팩트를 즉시 낸 몇 안되는 프로젝트여서 기뻤다.\n6월 실적\n4월의 실적이 좋았기에 2분기 합산 실적은 최근 2년 중에선 가장 좋았다.\n다만, 4월의 실적만으로 이루어진 셈이고, 5~6월은 오히려 더 줄었다.\n4월처럼 여러 이벤트가 겹경사로 생기는 일은 우리 통제 밖에 있는 경우가 많기에 하방선을 얼마나 단단하게 지킬 수 있냐가 중요했다.\n올해 2월, 5월 우리의 하방선이라 생각했던 지지선보다 훨씬 낮은 실적이 나왔다.\n쭈가 외부 미팅을 다녀올때마다 둘이서 이야기 나누는 시간이 길어졌다.\nB2B 구독제가 오픈되었지만, 당장 실적에 반영되기엔 시간이 필요했다.\n7~8월에 예정된 프로젝트들이 과연 4분기에 바로 성과를 낼 수 있을까?\n시간이 너무 부족하다는 생각이 들었다.\n클라우드, SaaS 등 전사에서 고정으로 지출되는 고정비 절감 프로젝트를 시작했다.\nDevOps와 함께 8월까지 줄일 수 있을만큼 고정비를 줄여보기로 했다.\n내 급여를 얼마나 줄일 수 있는지도 계산했다.\n30%를 줄인다면? 최저시급으로 줄인다면? 무급으로 줄인다면?\n지금 내 고정비에서 절대 빼지 못하는건 뭐가 있는지 정리했다.\n7월\n선물하기 오픈\n앱 내 무료강의 검색\n마케팅 파트너스 (어필리에이트 마케팅) 오픈\n강의 예약 오픈 기능 추가\n송파 -> 성남 이사\n마케팅 파트너스\n인프런의 어필리에이트 마케팅 서비스인 마케팅 파트너스를 오픈했다.\n인프런 내부 커뮤니티는 충분히 활성화 되어있지만 (질문/답변, 스터디, 팀프로젝트, 수강평 등) 외부에선 여전히 확산되지 않은게 많았다.\n그런 면에서 유저가 직접 자발적으로 개인 커뮤니티와 SNS에 공유하는것을 독려하는 어필리에이트 마케팅 서비스는 확장성에 있어서 필수라고 봤다.\n콜린은 어소시에이츠프로그램의 잠재력을 간파했다.\n알면 알수록 수익성이 매우 뛰어난 비즈니스 모델로 보였다.\n당시에 이미 3만 개의 제휴업체가 있었고 프로그램은 빠르게 성장하고 있었다.\n제휴업체들은 우리가 제공한 매우 기초적인 도구를 가지고도 창의적인 마케팅을 했다.\n그렇게 아마존의 전체 트래픽과 매출 비중에서 그들이 차지하는 비율은 점점 늘어났다.\n콜린은 장차 어소시에이츠프로그램이 아마존 비즈니스에 매우 크게 기여할 것이라고 믿었다.\n다만 이 같은 거대한 잠재력을 발휘하려면 몇 가지 변화가 필요했다.\n...\n콜린이 이 프로그램에 관여한 지 4년 만에 제휴업체의 수는 3만개에서 약 100만개로 급증했다.\n출처: 순서파괴\n더군다나 기존의 마케팅 프로그램처럼 선 지급 -> 후 성과가 아닌 실제 매출이 발생한 건에 대해서만 지불하는 방식이기 때문에 재무적으로도 좋은 프로그램이였다.\n교육은 직관적으로 어떤 형태인지 알 수 있는 물건 보다 훨씬 더 정성적인 후기가 중요하다.\n그래서 그 교육을 수강하신 분들의 후기가 굉장히 중요한데, 그 후기를 독려할 수 있는 수단이였다.\n이건 실제 제품팀내에서만 고민해야할 것이 아니기 때문에 마케팅 리드인 데이지와 (지금은 떠난) 콘텐츠 MD인 고트와 함께 제품에 관한 여러 정책들을 결정하고 구현했다.\n고트의 경우 외부 마케팅 에이전시들과 어필리에이트 마케팅 업체들을 직접 만나 많은 조언들을 듣고 팀 내부에 공유해주셨다.\n이렇게 7월에 런칭한 마케팅 파트너스는 10월이 되어서야 성과를 내기 시작했다.\n즉, 7월에는 실적을 촉진시킬 무언가가 없었다.\n조언\n어려운 결정을 해야하는 순간이 다가올수록 마음이 너무 답답했다.\n하드씽을 비롯해서 수많은 스타트업 서적들을 보는데도 결심이 잘 서지 않았다.\n결심을 해야하는데, 자꾸 결심을 못하는게 너무 답답한데 얘기할 사람이 없었다.\n바쁘신 것을 알지만 너무 답답한 마음에 범준님께 조언을 요청드렸다.\n\n\n트위터에서 다음과 같은 글을 봤다.\n\"세월호 사건은 159명이 죽은 '하나의 사건' 이 아니라,\n각각 자기의 인생을 살고 있던 '한명

둘 수 있도록 이야기할 것이다.\n동욱님도 당사자라는 것을 잊지 않았으면 좋겠다\" 라고 답변해주셨다.\n현재 팀의 상황과 나와 쭈가 할 수 있는 여러 선택지에 대한 이야기를 나누고나서 범준님이 응원을 해주셨다.\n\"리더로서의 동욱님을 응원하고 있어요.\n팀원들에겐 정말 죄송한 일인 것도 맞지만, 동욱님이 이걸 피하지 않고 꼭 온전히 경험으로 가져가셨으면 좋겠어요.\"\n잘 이겨내고 싶다는 생각이 강하게 들었다.\n이후에 영재님, 현태님, 두현님, 성철님을 뵙고 이야기를 나눴다.\n영재님은 제품을 총괄하는 사람으로서\n현태님은 실제로 같은 일을 실행했던 리더로서\n두현님과 성철님은 리더가 아닌 개인으로서의 관점에서 조언을 해주셨다.\n조언을 구할 분들이 주변에 많이 계시다는 것에 감사했다.\n이사\n7월에 송파 -> 성남으로 이사했다.\n\"만약 내 급여를 최저시급까지로 줄인다면 가장 문제가 되는 부분이 무엇일까?\" 고민을 와이프와 함께 했다.\n제일 큰 건은 2개였다.\n고정 생활비\n양가 부모님의 용돈\n양가 부모님의 용돈은 절대 줄일 생각이 없었기에 고정 생활비를 얼마나 줄일 수 있느냐가 중요했다.\n나는 차도 없고, 술/담배/게임 등 별도로 고정적으로 지출해야할 무언가가 있진 않았다.\n그래서 고정비에서 가장 크게 차지하는 것은 거주비였다.\n배민때부터 계속 송파구(잠실, 석촌, 송파등) 에서 거주했다.\n10년 가까이 지낸 동네를 떠나기 싫어서 가능한 송파구 안에서 거주비를 줄이고 싶었다.\n근데 한계가 있었다.\n결국은 동네를 이사하는 것이 가장 확실했다.\n비슷한 평수로 이사했음에도 월세 + 관리비로 거의 60만원이 절약되었다.\n우린 주말 부부로 매주 주말마다 서울에서 시간을 보냈다.\n와이프가 있는 전주에서는 할 수 있는게 제한적이기도 했고, 내 개인 활동으로 인한 주말 스케줄이 있다보니 서울을 신혼집으로 꾸리고 생활 하고 있었다.\n그러다보니 최소한의 집 크기가 필요하다보니 이사를 해도 줄일 수 있는 거주비에는 한계가 있긴 했다.\n만약 더 최악의 상황이 와서 무급으로 회사를 다녀야 하는 상황이 오면 지금 집에 있는 대부분의 짐은 모두 전주에 있는 와이프 집으로 옮기고 평일은 원룸에서, 주말은 전주에서 생활하는 것에 대해서도 이야기했다.\n와이프는 이젠 이런 결정에 익숙하다고 했다.\n줌인터넷에서 연봉을 깎고 배민으로 가는 것도,\n배민에서 인프랩으로 이직하면서 연봉도 깎고, 전세 대출 이자 지원이 끊기게 되서 전세 보증금을 월세로 전환하는 것도 봤다.\n\"그냥 쟤가 또 저러나보다\" 라고 그러려니 했다고 한다.\n고정비를 더 줄여야 하면 \"전주/익산에서 수서역까지 SRT타면 1시간 30분이면 가니깐 너가 잠 줄이고 전주에서 판교로 출퇴근하고 거주비를 0원으로 만드는 건 어떠냐\"고 와이프가 슬쩍 물어봤다.\nSRT 한달 왕복 기차표값이면 성남에 월세 구하고도 남겠다는 이야기를 하며 같이 웃었다.\n얼마나 줄일지 결정하진 않았지만, 미리 생활 습관은 바꿔놓는게 좋다고 생각했다.\n특별한 일이 아니고서는 집에서 배달 음식은 시켜먹지 않기로 했다.\n택시 타는 횟수를 줄였다.\nK-패스 카드를 발급 받았다.\n연 구독인 SaaS와 구독 제품들을 모두 월 구독으로 전환했다.\n주말마다 데이트 코스로 도서관을 다니기 시작했다.\n매달 사던 성장주들을 다 팔고 배당주로 바꿨다.\n돈을 모아서 무언갈 하고 싶다는 그런게 딱히 없어서 어느정도 충분한 현금이 확보된 뒤로는 적금이 아닌 주식을 정기 매수 해왔다.\n지금은 내 고정비를 충당해줄 배당주가 훨씬 더 필요하다고 생각되서 이익이 나지 않은 주식들도 포함해서 전부 배당주로 교체했다.\n도서 구매 비용은 줄이지 않기로 했다.\n아끼기만 해서는 이 위기를 극복하는게 아니라 길게 연명만 하는 것 뿐이기 때문에, 결국 더 잘되려면 더 효율적으로 스스로를 성장시키는게 필요했고 그런 의미에서 줄이지 않기로 했다.\n더 많이 읽기로 했다.\n8월\n챌린지 서비스 오픈\n강의실 내 스크립트 검색 기능 추가\n토스페이 직연동 전환\n수강바구니 UI/UX 개편\n헤더 등 전체 서비스 UI 개선\n챌린지\n회사의 2번째 메인 모델인 코호트 교육 서비스 챌린지를 오픈했다.\nAI로 인해 점점 사람:사람으로 터치하면서 배우는 것에 대한 니즈가 계속 커질 것으로 봤다.\n누구나 예상한 흐름이기도 해서 해외 사례에서도 지속적으로 코호트 교육의 성공에 대한 이야기가 계속 나왔다.\n\n\n이미 인프런에 VOD 강의를 올려두고, 이를 네이버카페와 카카오톡으로 한입 챌린지라는 코호트 교육 코스로 잘 활용하고 계신 지식 공유자 이정환 님과의 인터뷰도 진행했다.\n\n\n챌린지 서비스의 중요성은 팀원 전체가 쉽게 수긍이 된 상태였고, MVP를 어디까지로 볼 것인지가 중요했다.\n이때 오판이 있었다.\n챌린지 라는 서비스의 시작은 워밍업 클럽 이다.\n여기에 정환님과 같은 지식공유자분들의 인터뷰를 추가 참고했다.\n그래서 초기 MVP에서 풀어내야할 Problem을 \"워밍업 클럽처럼 MD가 운영하는 것이 아닌 지식 공유자분들이 본인의 강의로 직접 기수제를 운영하도록 하자\" 로 잡았다.\n워밍업 클럽을 통해 수강생분들이 지식 공유자분과 함께 하는 참여형 교육에 대해 니즈가 높다는 건 검증이 된 상태였으니 이쪽으로 방향을 게속 잡고 있었다.\n기존 강의가 있다는 가정하에 기획하다보니 기존 강의가 없는 사람은 챌린지를 개설하는 것은 배제한채 시작을 했는데 이게 초기 MVP의 오판이였다.\n매 주마다 진도를 체크하고 수강을 독려하는 것이 쉬운 일이 아니기 때문에 한정된 자원으로 VOD 촬영과 질문/답변을 해주는 것에만 집중하는 것을 원하시는 지식 공유자분들이 훨씬 많았다.\n오히려 외부에서 라이브 스트리밍과 디스코드/슬랙으로 코호트 교육을 운영하시는 분들의 니즈가 훨씬 높았다.\n그래서 MVP 출시후 곧바로 기존에 인프런 강의가 없는 분들도 챌린지를 개설할 수 있는 방향으로 빠르게 확장했다.\n강의가 없어도 라이브 스트리밍으로 충분히 코스를 운영하실 수 있는 분들의 참여로 콘텐츠가 빠르게 늘어났다.\n런칭한지 얼마되지 않은 서비스가 이렇게 빨리 회사의 주요 서비스가 된 이례적인 경우였다.\n챌린지의 자체 매출이 회사에 기여하는 부분도 있겠지만, 챌린지는 그 외 부가적인 기여부분도 굉장히 컸다.\n완강 챌린지나, 딩코딩코님의 무료 라이브 챌린지 등은 챌린지 매출에는 기여하는 부분이 적지만 VOD 매출에는 큰 영향을 주는 것이였다.\n특히 IT 출판사분들이 신간 서적이 나올때마다 완독 챌린지 를 개설해주셨고, 적게는 수십명, 많게는 수백명이 신간 도서를 구매해서 완독을 하는 방향은 출판사/인프런/독자 모두가 만족할 수 있는 모델이였다.\n\n\n루키스님, 정환님, 딩코딩코님 등 기존 온라인 강의를 만드시던 지식공유자분들도 챌린지 코스를 개설하기 시작하셨고 많은 수강생들을 늘려나가셨다.\n비용절감\n이나모리 가즈오의 회계 경영 과 하마터면 또 회계를 모르고 일할 뻔했다! 을 읽었다.\n적자내지 않는 기업은 무엇이 다른가?\n파산 위기에 놓인 기업을 흑자로 돌려세운 CEO는 무엇이 다른가?\n매번 이익을 낸다는건 어떤 의미일까?\n등등이 궁금했다.\n회사의 상황에 따라 \"나에게 이런 역량이 있다면 얼마나 좋았을까\" 하는 생각을 했다.\n6월부터 시작한 각종 클라우드, SaaS 비용 절감의 1차 결과가 나왔다.\n\n\nDevOps에서 SaaS를 대신해 직접 구축한 것들을 포함해서 여러 편의기능들의 구독을 취소하기도 하고 각종 클라우드 비용을 줄일만큼 줄였다.\n그래도 현재의 상황을 반전시키진 못했다.\n그 외 더 줄일 것들은 복지에 관한 것들 뿐이였다.\n점심 식대\n저녁 식대\n택시비\n간식비\n인당 15,000원을 지원하는 점심 식대를 지원하지 않으면 월 고정비가 1,600만원이 절감된다.\n인당 20,000원을 지원하는 저녁 식대는 (모든 팀원들이 야근하는 것은 아니더라도) 월 고정비로 700~800만원 정도가 지불되었다.\n야근 택시비에 대한 고정비도 대략 600~800만원 정도 고정적으로 필요했다.\n만약 이들을 모두 다 없앤다면 월 고정비를 거의 3,000만원 가까이 줄일 수 있다.\n이것 외에도 다양한 복지들이 있는데, 이들을 전부 다 없앤다면 월 4~5,000만원의 고정비가 절약될 수 있다.\n모든 복지를 없앤 뒤, 최대한 많은 인원과 계속 함께하는 것이 좋을까?\n이걸 그대로 유지한 채, 인원을 줄이는 것이 좋을까?\n모두가 급여의 10~20%를 삭감한다면 얼마나 더 많은 이들과 함께 할 수 있을까?\n등등의 생각들로 매일 계산기를 두드리고 쭈와 이야기를 나눴다.\n주변의 많은 분들이 다들 같은 조언을 해줬다.\na. 레이오프를 많이 했다고 후회하는 대표는 본 적이 없다. 할 수 있는 최대한 해라. 60~70%까지 해도 된다. 이렇게 해도 의외로 회사는 잘 돌아간다.\nb. 처음 레이오프를 적게 했다가 두 번 레이오프하는 게 최악이다.\n출처: 실패를 통과하는 일\n10명의 대표님들을 만나면 똑같이 저 이야기를 해주셨다.\n레이오프를 많이 해서 후회한 적은 한번도 없다.\n처음에 덜 했다가 2차, 3차로 진행하면 가장 최악의 상황을 경험한다.\n전 직장에서 레이오프를 경험했던 신디, 로이도 PM 워크샵에서 같은 이야기를 주셨다.\n둘은 대표가 아닌 팀원의 입장임에도 제발 2차, 3차까지 가지 않았으면 한다고 했다.\n1차까지는 그래도 어떻게든 남은 팀원들과 으쌰으쌰 하려고 했지만, 2차, 3차까지 가고나니\n\"4차, 5차는 없는게 확실할까?\"\n\"뭐가 더 남았을까?\" 등등의 불안감으로 더 일하기 힘들었다고 한다.\n10월부터 시작되는 4분기 흑자를 위해선 모든 지출 비용은 9월로 다 마감처리가 되어야만 했다.\n올 초 80명이 넘던 구성원이 8월말엔 70명이 되었다.\n운영/사업이 24명,\n제품이 44명.\n제품팀이 전체 인원의 64%였다.\n운영/사업은 서비스의 현재를 책임지고, 제품은 서비스의 미래를 책임진다고 생각한다.\n어디를 줄여야하는지는 명확했다.\n이 위기를 극복하기 위해 필요한 역량이 무엇일까 고민하고 한명 한명 작성했다.\n쭈와 함께 결정을 내렸다.\n9월\n회사 위기 공유\n기기대수 제한 추가\n챌린지 라이브 기능 추가\nMicro DIPS 선정\n챌린지 라이브 기능 추가\n챌린지가 코호트 교육으로 제대로 자리 잡기 위해선 라이브 스트리밍 기능이 필요했다.\n스타트업답게 유튜브 라이브나 Zoom등을 활용한 방법도 있겠지만, 임시방편으로 쓸 순 있어도 챌린지에서만큼은 쓰면 안된다 생각했다.\n크게 3가지 이유 때문이였다.\n일관된 교육 경험\nMD에 의존하지 않은 콘텐츠\n채팅/스트리밍 데이터의 유실\n챌린지 내 VOD 강의를 듣다가 라이브가 시작되면 Zoom이나 Google Meet으로 이동했다가, 라이브가 끝나면 다시 인프런 강의실로 오고 가는 과정은 너무 불편하다고 생각했다.\n더군다나 챌린지를 운영하시는 지식 공유자분들이 어떤 라이브 스트리밍 도구를 쓰는지에 따라 수강생분들은 그것들 전체를 다 설치해야만 한다.\nPC/모바일 모두에 말이다.\nA 지식공유자분은 Zoom 으로 라이브를 하고\nB 지식공유자분은 Google Meet으로 라이브를 하고\nC 지식공유자분은 Discord로 라이브를 한다면\n그 과정들을 모두 듣는 수강생은 해당 서비스 전체가 다 설치되어있어야만 한다.\n유튜브 라이브로 단일화 해서 한다고 하면 우리 운영 팀에서 모든 라이브에 관여해서 운영해야하는데 그러면 결국 인력수에 비례한 서비스 성장 방법이기 때문에 이걸 선택해선 안된다.\n각종 화상 회의 도구에 흩어진 채팅 데이터나 스트리밍 데이터가 유실되는 것도 장기적으로 큰 문제라고 생각했다.\n해당 라이브를 못본 사람들은 녹화된 영상도, 당시의 나눈 대화도 전혀 보지 못하는 상황이 발생하기 때문이다.\n챌린지와 전혀 무관한 커리어 Cell에게 해당 프로젝트를 맡겼다.\n이미 다른 Cell이 모두 회사의 비즈니스와 관련된 프로젝트를 진행중이였기 때문에 마케팅 파트너스에 이어 챌린지 라이브를 맡았다.\n100ms 를 활용해 라이브를 구현했다.\n라이브 내 채팅을 구현하지 않고, 라이브와 채팅을 별도로 나눠서 구현했다.\n기존에 갖고 있던 채팅 서비스를 함께 활용했다.\n라이브와 채팅을 별도로 나눠 구현했기 때문에 라이브가 없어도 채팅에 참여가능하고 기록이 남았다.\n라이브 시작 전, 종료 후, 라이브 일정이 없을때 등등 채팅에 참여할 수 있어서 만족도가 다들 높으셨다.\n라이브 스트리밍 기능이 추가됨에 따라 각종 1회성 라이브 챌린지가 개설되었다.\n신규 강의 홍보를 위한 온라인 라이브를 비롯해 도서 챌린지에서 저자와의 라이브토크 등 다양한 형태로 챌린지를 활용하기 시작했다.\n이후 진행될 완강 챌린지의 근간이 되었다.\n위기 공유\n전사에 위기 상황을 PPT로 작성해서 공유했다.\n이번의 대상은 프로덕트 조직이기에 발표 준비를 직접 하고 전사 공유도 직접했다.\n나와 쭈의 급여를 30% 삭감하기로 했다.\n(지금은 실적이 회복되어서 다시 원복했다.)\n10~12월의 흑자 전환이 어려울때 더 줄일만한 것들이 있어야 하는데 그때 가장 먼저 남은 70%의 급여를 줄이기로 했다.\n이것 역시 전사에 공유드렸다.\n이미 어느정도 상황을 예상하신 분들도 계셨지만 그럼에도 전사에 큰 충격이 되었다.\n누구누구가 대상인지를 공유드리진 못하고, 한분 한분 면담때 말씀드린다고 하니 다들 불안에 빠졌다.\n내가 무너지지 않을까 쭈가 걱정을 많이 했다.\n제품팀과의 면담을 본인이 직접 해도 된다는 이야기도 해줬다.\n다만, 그 이야기를 내 입으로 전하지 못하면 내 인생은 거기서 끝날 것 같았다.\n좋을때는 직접 얘기하고, 안좋을때는 대표/HR 뒤로 숨는 리더에게 누가 신뢰를 줄 수 있겠나.\n천하의 악당이 되는 것도 내가 해야할 몫이여야 했다.\n44명의 모든 제품팀 인원과 1on1을 진행했다.\n함께 할 수 있는지 아닌지에 대해 이야기를 드렸다.\n짧게는 1시간, 길게는 2시간씩.\n여전히 마음이 있는 몇년간 만난 연인에게 헤어지자는 이야기를 한번 하려면 몇달을 고민한다.\n그건 아무리해도 익숙해지지 않는다.\n그걸 짧은 시간에 너무 많은 사람과 했다.\n아무리 해도 입이 잘 떨어지지 않았다.\n드라이하게 해야한다고 정말 많은 조언을 들었지만, 막상 상대의 얼굴을 보면 면접때부터 닥터때까지 달려오던 그 시간들이 떠올라서 말이 안나왔다.\n꾸역꾸역 면담을 다 완료했다.\n헤어지기로한 인원들 이외에도 퇴사하겠다는 팀원들이 다수 발생했다.\n특히 3~5년 이상 근속한 오래된 팀원들이 다수 추가 이탈했다.\n우리팀이 갖고 있는 강점이자 약점이 동료애다.\n충분히 더 여건이 좋은 회사를 갈 수 있음에도 함께하는 동료들이 워낙 좋기에 다른 회사를 찾아보지 않고 3~5년씩 다닌 사람들이 많았다.\n그런 동료들과 더이상 함께 하지 못하게 되었을 때 예상보다 훨씬 더 많은 인원이 자발적 퇴사를 했다.\n예상한 것보다 많은 팀원들이 추가로 이탈하게 되어서 재무적으로는 안정적이게 되었지만 심리적으로는 불안정하게 되었다.\n자발적 퇴사는 9월에서 끝나지 않고, 10, 11, 12월까지 계속 이어졌다.\n(이 글을 쓰는 시점엔 프로덕트 인원은 30명, 전체 팀원은 50명이 되었다.)\n단단한 프로덕트 조직을 일궈낸 것에 자부심을 갖고 있었지만, 이때만큼은 스스로를 계속 의심했다.\n헤어져야할 팀원들의 인원수를 확정짓는데 너무 오랜 시간이 걸렸다.\n8월까지의 재무제표와 앞으로의 비용에 관해 전부 계산되었음에도 \n\"이렇게하면 이만큼은 더 같이 갈 수 있지 않을까\", \n\"저 제품이 이렇게 성과를 내면 이만큼은 더 같이 갈 수 있지 않을까\" 등등.\n미련한 희망을 갖고 계속 계산했다.\n회사와 팀원 전체를 두고 1% 확률의 도박에 참여하려는 것 같다는 생각을 했다.\n지금 해야하는 건 도박이 아니라 확실한 생존인데도 말이다.\n9월엔 어떤 프로젝트를 진행하거나 완료하기 힘들 정도로 붕 떠있는 채로 한달을 보냈다.\n그 시간이 너무 아까웠다.\n그렇지만, 무언갈 할 수 있는 상황은 아니였다.\n팀 내 자발적 퇴사가 멈출것 같지 않은 분위기가 계속 됐다.\n10월\n페이코 추가\n클립 오픈\n베트남 마케팅 파트너스 오픈\n커뮤니티 통합 피드 페이지 추가\n향로 완강 챌린지 시작\n완강 챌린지 시작\nVlad에 이어 두번째 개인 TF인 완강 챌린지를 시작했다.\n9월에 쭈와 함께 식사를 하던 중 챌린지가 예상보다 콘텐츠 개설 속도가 나지 않아서 내가 직접 한번 운영해보는게 어떤지 제안을 해주셨다.\n“챌린지가 어떤건지 외부 수강생들도, 지공자들도 잘 모르는 것 같다.\n향로가 한번 챌린지가 어떤건지 사람들에게 보여주면 어떨까요?”\n\n\n회사 실적을 위해서는 뭐든 해야겠다 생각하던 중이라서 해보기로 했다.\n챌린지 목표 참여 인원을 1,000명으로 잡았다.\n그정돈 해야 될 것 같았다.\n“1,000명을 참여시키려면 무슨 주제로 해야할까?”\n“하나의 주제로 1,000명을 모을 수 있을까?”\n“이미 존재하는 수많은 VOD를 두고 새 주제가 필요할까?”\n내가 강의를 제작하기 보다는 각자가 원하는 VOD 강의를 구매해서 기간 내 완강하는 것을 목표로 하기로 했다. (like 온라인 모각코)\n방점은 결제가 아닌 완강이다.\n우린 학습 플랫폼이고, 많은 결제를 일으키는 이벤트를 기획하기 보다는 내가 원하는 공부를 끝까지 할 수 있게 만드는게 좋겠다는 생각을 했다.\n부산 출장가는 기차안에서 러프하게 기획을 했다.\n\n\n이번 추석 연휴가 길어서 시작하기에 딱 맞춤이였다.\n내가 긴 연휴를 공부하는 시간으로 잡고 있기 때문에 나와 같은 사람들이 인프런에는 많을 것 같았다.\n그래서 \"긴 추석 연휴 기간 동안 강의 하나씩 정해서 완강하기\" 를 주제로 챌린지를 준비했다.\n파일럿 성격이 강하기 때문에 제품적으로 풀어내기 보다는 가능하면 운영적으로 풀어내기로 했다.\n마케팅적으로 회사에 역효과를 주면 안되기 때문에 데이지와 애시에게 최종적으로 기획안 컨펌을 받았다.\n도라, 애시가 본인 업무 외 시간을 활용해서 같이 운영을 하기로 하고,\n각 제품팀에서 시간을 잘개 쪼갤 수 있는 분들을 모집해서 간단한 편의 기능을 추가했다.\n(수강신청시 자동 쿠폰 발급 기능)\n약풍, 어텀, 올리가 자발적으로 나서주셨다.\n\"1,000명을 모을 수 있을까\" 고민되었지만, 1,600분이나 신청해주셨다.\n학습과 성장에 진심인 분들이 많다고 다시금 느꼈다.\n카톡방을 개설해 참가자분들과 매일 매일 공부인증을 하면서 추석 연휴 기간 내내 독려했다.\n\n\n\n처가에 갔을 때도 매일 카페에 가서 공부하고 인증을 올렸다.\n와이프가 처가 가족분들께 이야기를 잘 해줘서 매일 갈 수 있었다.\n추석 연휴 기간 동안 3번의 라이브를 진행했다.\n매번 학습을 독려하고 응원하는 메세지를 보내다가 마지막 라이브때는 남아 있는 팀원들이 생각나서 그들에게도 도움이 될 만한 이야기를 했다.\n챌린지 마지막 날,\n오픈 카톡방이 종료되는 그날 카톡방에는 많은 사람들의 감사의 메세지가 올라왔다.\n후기에도 많은 감사와 응원의 메세지가 올라왔다.\n\n\n\n\n추석 연휴 전체를 이 챌린지에 쏟아내서 연휴 다운 연휴는 전혀 보내지 못했지만, 전혀 아쉽지 않았다.\n인프런에 합류한 지난 4년 6개월의 시간을 보상 받는 기분이였다.\n조직 개편\n30%에 가까운 프로적트 조직 인원이 줄었기 때문에 조직 개편을 진행했다.\n이전에는 8~12명 단위로 4개 조직을 구성했다면,\n이번에는 2/4/6명 단위로 6개 조직으로 구성했다.\n조직의 규모는 줄이고, 조직의 개수는 늘렸다.\n저렇게 극단적으로 작은 조직은 선호하진 않는다.\nPM 1명, FE 1명, BE 1명 과 같이 직군별로 1명씩만 포함되는 조직의 형태인데, 이럴 경우 1명만 퇴사하거나 부재여도 해당 조직이 제대로 업무를 수행할 수 없게 된다.\n그래서 가능하면 개발자는 같은 직군은 2명 이상이 있는 것이 좋다고 보고 조직을 구성해왔다.\n다만, 전체 인원수가 부족하고 채용 계획도 불투명한 상태에선 그렇게 할 순 없다.\n기존처럼 하면 큰 2개의 조직으로 모든 일을 처리해야하는데, 이러면 하나의 제품에 온전히 집중하기 힘들어 속도감이 급격히 떨어진다.\n반면, 작은 조직은 기민하고 집중할 수 있다.\n조직의 안정감을 높이려면 큰 조직이지만,\n조직의 속도를 높이려면 작은 조직으로 구성해야한다.\n4개 조직에서 6개 조직으로 만들었다.\n조직을 작게하되 수를 늘리니 담당 제품을 명확하게 할당할 수 있었다.\n온라인 강의/챌린지/B2B Cell은 해당 제품만을 집중적으로 개선하고 확장하는 것으로,\n운영생산성/주문정산/플랫폼 Cell은 전사의 생산성 개선 혹은 서비스 전반의 플랫폼 작업들을 담당했다.\nAI로 인한 조직의 변화를 우리도 실험해보기로 했다.\n백엔드 개발자인 감자와 프론트엔드 개발자인 럭끼가 PM 역할을 함께 하기로 했다.\n감자는 사내에서 가장 AI를 잘 쓰는 개발자이다.\n운영생산성 조직을 맡아 프론트엔드 개발자인 퍼즈와 두 명이서 운영/사업에서 운영 작업들을 자동화하고 AI를 적극적으로 도입하는 역할을 맡았다.\n감자는 여기가 첫 회사이지만, 문제를 구조적으로 분해해서 볼 수 있는 사람이였다.\n조직 내 생산성을 개선하려면 결국 해당 조직들이 하고 있는 업무를 구조적으로 분해해서 들여다볼 수 있어야 하는데, 이건 연차와 관계 없이 사람 본연이 갖고 있는 평소의 생각 습관에 가깝다고 생각한다.\n그런 면에서 아주 훌륭한 역량을 갖고 있었다.\n온라인 강의 조직은 럭끼가 맡기로 했다.\n회사의 메인 서비스인 온라인 강의는 보니라는 정신적 지주 PM의 이탈로 누가 그 역할을 맡을 것인지 고민이였다.\n이 주제로 퇴사자인 보니와도 이야기를 나누었고, 디자이너인 율무와도 이야기를 나누었다.\n같은 조직내 프론트엔드 개발자였던 럭끼가 가장 적임자라 판단했다.\n럭끼는 개발자이지만 누구보다 훌륭한 커뮤니케이션과 변화 수용력을 갖고 있었다.\n제품적 관점에서는 아직 경험이 부족하지만, 율무라는 좋은 디자이너가 함께 했기에 제품에 대한 관점은 율무가 도와주면 될 것 같았다.\n럭끼는 학구열도 높아서 새로운 역할을 부여받으면 그 역할을 잘하기 위해 다양한 학습을 해서 조직 전체에 활기를 심어줄 것 같았다.\n더군다나 프론트엔드 개발자 출신의 PM 이 가지고 있는 강점을 충분히 알고 있어서 한번 시도해봐도 되겠다 싶었다.\n럭끼는 PM 역할 자체에 충분히 흥미를 갖고 있었기에 빠르게 PM에게 필요한 역량을 학습했다.\n책으로, 강의로, 다른 PM들에게 조언을 구하는 등 그가 평소에 어떻게 새로운 지식을 습득하는지 알 수 있을 정도로 주변의 많은 지식들을 흡수했다.\n그리고 그렇게 배운 것을 Cell 내에 계속해서 전파해서 Cell 전체가 럭끼와 함께 성장하고 있다.\n이 결정은 3개월이 지난 지금 봐도 좋은 선택이였다.\n마케팅 조직에서 데이터 분석을 하던 루나를 프로덕트 조직으로 옮겼다.\n조직에 데이터 분석가가 1명만 남은 상태라 어떻게 하면 더 큰 임팩트를 낼 수 있을까 고민했다.\n마케팅 성과 분석도 중요하지만, 전사의 제품 지표를 개선하는 것이 하나밖에 없는 데이터 분석가를 가장 임팩트 있게 활용하는 것이라고 생각했다.\n루나가 이동한 플랫폼 Cell은 테디와 엠제이가 속해 있었고, 이 조직의 목표는 가입, 검색 등 서비스의 근간이 되는 플랫폼의 성장이였다.\n테디는 데이터와 그로스에 가장 능숙한 PM이고, 엠제이 역시 데이터에 능숙한 디자이너이시기에 데이터 분석가인 루나까지 합류하면 큰 시너지를 낼 것으로 봤다.\n공식적으로 데이터 분석팀이 없기에 매주 월요일 1시간씩 루나가 세운 가설과 분석에 대해 이야기 나누는 시간을 가지기로 했다.\n나는 데이터 분석을 전문적으로 해본 사람이 아니라서 내가 함께 분석을 할 수는 없다.\n다만 제품 리더로서의 관점으로 피드백을 드릴 수 있기에, 리더로서 가설에 대한 내 생각, 분석에 대한 내 생각, 루나가 세운 가설의 임팩트를 보고 제품 전체의 실행 등을 주로 이야기했다.\n루나도 나와 함께 손발을 맞춰보는 것이 처음이기에 서로 엇박자 나는 일이 많았다.\n같은 이야기를 해도 서로 다르게 해석하기도 하고, 도돌이표처럼 같은 얘기가 반복되는 회의도 있었다.\n한번은 회의시간에 서로가 시원하게 다 쏟아내기도 했다.\n(난 대화 체력이 좋다. 상대가 GG치기전까지는 몇시간이고 대화할 수 있다.)\n루나와의 회의 시간에서 배우는 것들이 점점 많아졌다.\n10월 실적\n챌린지, B2B 구독제, 마케팅 파트너스, 글로벌 확장, 추석 할인, 완강 챌린지 등 다양한 영역에서 좋은 소식이 발생해 4월에 이어 올해 2번째 흑자를 달성했다.\n단순히 영업이익만 증가한 것이 아니라, 거래액과 순매출 모두가 증가했고 그걸 기반으로 영업이익 역시 흑자가 되었다.\n11월과 12월은 어떻게 해야 될까 고민도 되지만,\n그럼에도 4분기의 시작이 너무나 다행이였다.\n반대로 프로덕트 조직의 사기는 좀처럼 회복되지 않았다.\n퇴사 예정인 분들이 계속해서 나왔고, 누가 연차를 쓰면 면접 보러가냐 는 농담이 조직 내에서 자주 들리기 시작했다.\n서로가 서로에게 제발 떠나지 말아달라는 마음속 외침을 온 몸으로 표현하는 것 같았다.\n\"아무래도 조직이 예전처럼 활기가 넘치진 않는 것 같다.\n다들 열정이 넘쳤는데 지금은 그런것 같지 않다.\n예전에는 정말 야근하는 사람이 많았는데, 지금은 거의 없다.\" 를 1on1 티타임 할 때마다 들었다.\n저녁 먹고 와서 아무도 없는 사무실을 볼 때의 휑함을 많은 팀원들이 느끼고 있었다.\n\"사람도 줄었으니, 남은 사람들이 그만큼 더 열심히 해야 합니다\" 라는 메세지를 전달하고 싶진 않았다.\n그들에겐 마음을 추스릴 시간이 필요했다.\n각자가 스스로 이 상황을 해석하고, 이해하고, 납득하는 시간이 필요하다고 봤다.\n추스릴 시간이 필요하다고 해서 이들이 본인의 역할들을 하지 않는 사람들은 아니다.\n주어진 역할은 충실히 하되, 예전처럼 열정적으로 할 수 있냐, 없냐는 이 시간을 어떻게 스스로 이겨내는지가 중요했다.\n보채지 않고, 다그치지 않고 기다리기로 했다.\n대신 자주 이야기 나누고, 필요하면 같은 설명을 몇번이라도 했다.\n내가 할 일은 그들이 추스리고나서 돌아올 곳이 있도록 하는 것이였다.\n서비스가 망하면 추스려도 의미가 없으니깐.\n할로윈 챌린지, 박소령 대표님과의 챌린지, 진중님과의 챌린지 등 단기적으로 할 수 있는 여러 일들을 기획하고 진행했다.\n개인 SNS에 신규 강의들의 홍보 글을 계속해서 공유했다.\n제품적인 고민 보다는 사업에 대한 고민을 좀 더 많이 하고 실행에 옮겼다.\n11월\n영어/일본어 마케팅 파트너스 오픈\n조르기/대신결제 오픈\nAI 기반 강의 썸네일 자동 생성 기능 추가\nAI 기반 강의 소개 자동 생성 기능 추가\n강의 제작 간소화\n강의 영상만 있으면 강의 썸네일과 소개 페이지를 자동으로 만들어주는 제작 간소화가 오픈되었다.\nAI 기반의 자막, 번역, 더빙\nAI 기반의 답변, 퀴즈와 채점\nAI 기반의 강의 자동 제작\n그간 AI가 들어간 기능들이 수강생분들을 대상으로 했다면, 이번엔 지식공유자분들이 교육에 집중할 수 있는 기능을 준비했다.\n서비스 곳곳에 AI가 들어갔지만, 우린 AI 교육 기업입니다 를 드러내놓고 강조하진 않는다.\n교육을 중심에 두고 AI가 도와주는 형태가 되어야 하는데,\n어느 순간 AI를 어떻게든 넣으려고 해서 도리어 고객 경험을 해치는걸 너무 많이 봤다.\n\"AI니깐 써보세요!\" 라는 메세지는 의미가 없다.\nAI가 했는지, 사람이 직접 한건지는 고객에겐 상관이 없고, 그래서 \"나한테 어떤 가치를 줄 수 있느냐\" 가 중요하다.\n'AI' 퀴즈가 아니라, AI'퀴즈'를,\n'AI' 자막/번역이 아니라 AI'자막/번역'을,\n'AI' 강의제작이 아니라 AI'강의제작' 을.\n그런 의미에서는 여태 나온 기능들을 많은 분들이 좋아해주셨다.\n\n\n\n\n수강생 사이드를 넘어, 지식 공유자분들이 더 쉽게 강의를 제작할 수 있도록 도와야할 때였다.\n영상 제작 자체에 대한 허들도 낮춰야겠지만,\n이미 콘텐츠를 가지고 있음에도 제작하는 것을 어려워 하는 분들이 많다는걸 알게 됐다.\n썸네일, 강의 소개 페이지 작성등에 허들을 느끼셨다.\n물론 외부의 AI 도구를 사용해서 썸네일도, 소개도 다 AI에게 맡기고 그걸 그대로 복&붙만 해도 된다.\n다만, 그러면 우리가 플랫폼이 되진 못할 것 같았다.\nAI 활용 능력과 상관 없이 일정 품질 이상의 썸네일과 소개 페이지가 나올 수 있도록, 지식 공유자분은 교육에만 집중할 수 있도록 이 부분을 플랫폼이 해결해야한다고 봤다.\n\n\n\n직접 디자인하시는게 훨씬 더 좋으신 분들은 직접 하실 수 있도록 하기 위해 자동으로 만들어주는 썸네일과 소개페이지는 필수가 아닌 선택으로 두었다.\n그럼에도 오픈한지 한달이 안되어서 20% 가 넘는 비율의 콘텐츠가 자동 썸네일과 소개페이지를 선택해주셨다.\n가설이 맞았다는 것을 확인했으니 더 많은 부분에서 온전히 콘텐츠에만 집중하실 수 있는 환경으로 달릴 수 있게 됐다.\n조르기/대신결제\n새롭게 구성된 주문/정산 Cell이 나와 함께한 첫 프로젝트이다.\n특히나 회사를 가장 오래 다닌 스댕은 디자이너로서는 나와 처음으로 인프런 서비스를 같이 해보게 되었다.\n(이전에 랠릿을 함께 만들었지만, 그 이후엔 함께 한 적이 없다.)\n스댕과 나의 합이 처음이다보니 초기 킥오프와 초기 기획안에서 커뮤니케이션 비용이 많이 들었다.\n스댕은 내가 내는 의견에 대해 반대하고 싶어도 제대로 표현을 하지 못했고, 나는 그게 스댕의 동의인줄 알고 넘어가버렸다.\n몇 번의 피드백 루프와 스댕의 반대 의견을 받아보면서 점점 합을 맞춰나가기 시작했다.\n로이와도 사업적인 제품이 아닌 순수 고객 만족을 위한 제품을 처음 같이 만들어보기에 서로 생각하는 MVP 범위를 좁히는데 시간을 많이 썼다.\n킥오프에서도 제일 검증하고 싶었던 그 가설 하나만 확인해보려면 어떤 것만 남길 것인지 Cutting 을 계속했다.\n선물하기와 조르기는 유저 바이럴 측면에서 장점이 큰 기능이다.\n기존 인프런 유저가 직접 인프런 서비스를 공유하게 만들기 때문이다.\n선물하기: 기존 인프런 유저가 타 유저에게 강의를 선물함으로 인프런을 알림\n조르기: 기존 인프런 유저가 인프런 밖 유저에게 강의를 구매 요청함으로 인프런을 알림\n단순 매출 그 이상의 효과를 주는 프로젝트였다.\n재밌는 것은 선물하기와 조르기 중 조르기가 훨씬 더 매출과 거래건수가 높다.\n일반적인 커머스에서는 선물하기가 더 높은데,\n우린 교육 서비스이다보니 부모님/선배/선생님/재무팀 등에서 교육 지원을 받는 경우가 많았다.\n당장 내가 돈이 없어도 주변의 다른 사람들이 나의 성장을 지원하려는 경우가 많기 때문에 그로 인해 조르기에 대한 요청이 예상한대로 성과가 잘 나왔다.\n주문정산 Cell과 함께 세운 고객 페르소나 가설이 잘 맞아떨어져서 MVP출시부터 성과까지 매끄럽게 이루어졌다.\n좀 더 재미난 프로젝트들과 가설을 세워볼 수 있을 것 같다.\n11월 실적\n10월에 이어 또다시 순매출액과 영업이익이 증가했다.\n10월과 11월이 올해 매출액 기준 2, 3위를 달성했고 동월 기준으로는 2~3년내 중에선 가장 높았다.\n11월은 10월 보다 조금 더 실적이 좋았다.\n약 4%정도.\n좋은 성과와 함께 남아 계신 분들께도 좋은 소식을 전달하고 싶었다.\n하반기동안 진행하지 못했던 리프데이도 다시 시작했다.\n제품팀 전체에게 약 $200 한도의 AI 도구를 개개인에게 공식 지원하기 시작했다.\n\nClaude Code Team Premium Seat\nCursor Team Plan\n크리스마스부터 1월 1일까지 연말 방학을 하기로 결정했다.\n개발팀은 JetBrains All Product Pack, Claude Code Premium Seat (Max 5x), Cursor Team Plan을 모두 사용할 수 있게 되어 적극적으로 AI를 활용할 수 있게 되었다.\n성장지원금으로 연 180만원을 지원하지만, 이 지원금이 대부분 AI 구독료로 사용되고 있었다.\n한정된 금액 내에서 사용하다보니 AI를 적극적으로 활용하지도 못하고, 체력단련과 같은 자기개발도 전혀 하지 못하는 애매모호한 상태였기 때문에 이를 해결하고자했다.\n실적이 나지 않을때는 C레벨로서 말에 힘이 실리지 않는다.\n하나둘씩 성과가 나오기 시작하니 좀 더 편하게, 눈치 보지 않으면서 이야기할 수 있게 되었다.\n11월까지 실적이 결산되고 나서 전사에 실적과 각 프로젝트들의 결과를 공유드렸다.\nAI로 인해 앞으로의 교육이 어떻게 될 것 같은지에 대한 내 생각도 포함해서 전달드렸다.\n저녁 7시 이후에도 일에 몰두하는 팀원들이 하나둘씩 늘어나기 시작했다.\n먼저 티타임을 요청해서 흔들린 마음을 다 잡았다고 이야기하는 분들이 하나둘씩 늘어났다.\n긴 겨울잠에서 깨어나는 것 같았다.\n12월\n박소령 대표님과 챌린지 라이브\n김진중 CTO님과 챌린지 라이브\n앱 오프라인 다운로드 기능 추가\n프로필 페이지 개편\n강의 제작 과정 전체 다국어화\n크리스마스용 프로필 꾸미기 미니 게임 추가\n저품질 강의 자동 검수 필터 추가\n앱 푸시 기능 추가\n미니게임\n고슈, 우드, 올리가 사이드 프로젝트로 인프런 내 미니 게임을 만들어서 공유했다.\n10월 할로윈 챌린지때는 챌린지를 참여한 사람들에게만 보여주는 이스터에그 정도로만 했다면, 이번 연말에는 회사에서 공식적으로 알리는 형태가 되었다.\n10월 할로윈 챌린지를 진행하기 전에 갑자기 고슈가 DM을 주셨다.\n(퇴사 얘긴줄 알고 진짜 긴장감 Max....)\n\n\n3분이서 진행한 사이드 프로젝트가 있어서 이걸 운영 환경에 배포해도 되는지, 이걸 왜 진행하게 되었는지 등등을 이야기해주셨다.\n그러면서 아래 내용을 편지로 작성해서 전달해주셨다.\n\n\n공부 자체는 아무리 게임처럼 만들어도 외롭고 힘든 행위라는 것을 인정하고, 그렇다면 어떻게 하면 덜 힘들고, 덜 외롭게 할 수 있을까를 고민하면서 이 게임을 만들었다고 한다.\n그것도 업무 시간이 아닌 개인 시간을 활용해서.\n\"이들은 이렇게 이 시간을 견디고 있었구나\" 란 생각이 들었다.\n의도부터 메세지, 게임성까지 다 너무 좋아서 챌린지 라이브때 사람들에게 게임을 공유드렸다.\n단순히 시간 보내기 용도의 게임이 아니라 이 게임이 연휴에도 공부하시는 분들께 어떤 의미로 다가갔으면 하는지를 말씀드렸다.\n이후 연말용 프로필 꾸미기 게임까지 사이드 프로젝트로 구현해주셔서 12월의 챌린지때 이것도 챌린지 참가하신 분들께 공유드렸다.\n12월의 게임은 특히나 퀄리티가 너무 좋았다.\n\n\n팀에 전체적으로 활기가 돋는것 같았다.\n12월 실적\n이 글을 작성하는 시점엔 아직 B2B 결산이 끝나지 않아서 12월 실적이 정리되진 않았다.\nB2C 실적만 봐서는 12월도 나쁘진 않을 것 같다.\n스타트업으로서는 나쁘지 않은 것은 나쁜 것이다.\n훌륭해야만 하는데, 훌륭하지 못했다.\n다만, 극단적인 위기 상황에서 영업이익만 개선된게 아니라 거래액과 매출이 같이 성장한 것은 칭찬하고 싶다.\n연말에 프로덕트의 모든 Cell들과 올 한해 다들 고생 많았다는 의미로 돌아가면서 티타임을 가졌다.\nCell 티타임때 말이 없던 인트에게 \"인트는 하반기가 좀 어땠어요?\" 라고 질문을 드렸다.\n\"저는 인프랩에 와서 좋아하는 모든 것들을 다 해볼 수 있었어요. \n그 끝이 어떻게 마무리 되든 인프랩에서의 끝은 저한테는 이미 해피엔딩이에요\" 라고 아주 조용히, 잔잔하게 이야기 했다.\n\"난 이런 사람들과 함께 일을 하고 있구나\" 라고 생각했다.\n수백만 명을 위해 무언가를 만들고 멋진 동료들과 함께 일하는 건 축복이다.\n2. End, And\n스킨 인 더 게임(Skin in the Game)\n9~12월까지의 여정이 끝나고, 프로덕트 조직이 어느정도 안정화가 되고 나니 \"왜 퇴사하지 않느냐\" 는 질문을 많이 받았다.\n창업자가 아닌 C레벨은 보통 이런 경험 후에 많이들 퇴사하신다.\n리더로서 충분히 할 만큼 했고, 개인으로서는 너무 고통스러웠고, 긴 시간을 함께 하기도 했으니 쉬어야한다는 의견도 많았다.\n여기서 이 여정을 종료한다고 해도 누구나 납득가능하고 수고했다고 해주는 것을 안다.\n남은 여정이 엄청 순탄할 것인가? 생각한다면 그렇지 않을 것 같다.\n인프랩에서 앞으로 맞이해야할 여정들은 계속해서 어려움이 많을 것으로 예상된다.\n더 힘든 일이 많을 것 같다.\n근데, (명료하게 설명하긴 힘든데) 이대로 이 여정을 끝내버리면 뭔가 내 인생이 이상한 방향으로 비틀릴 것 같은 느낌이 들었다.\n이상한 감각인데, 종종 중요한 결정이 필요할때면 이 감각을 굉장히 신뢰하는 편이다.\n이 책의 마지막 장을 \"그래서 몸과 마음이 많이 지친 향로는 회사가 성장하는데 기여하지 못하고 퇴사를 했습니다\" 로 쓰고 싶지 않았다.\n\"그런 위기도 겪으면서 단단해진 향로와 인프랩 팀은 결국 유데미와 코세라를 모두 꺾고 글로벌 1위 플랫폼이 되었습니다\" 로 쓰고 싶다.\n올해까지, 내 나름대로는 인프런에 스킨 인 더 게임(Skin in the Game) 을 하고 있다.\n스킨 인 더 게임(Skin in the Game) 이란,\n자신이 내린 결정의 결과에 대해 '직접적인 이해관계나 위험(손실)을 공유하는 상태'를 뜻하는 용어이다.\n단순히 말로만 참여하는 것이 아니라, 결과가 나쁠 때 자신도 직접적인 타격을 입는 '자기 책임'과 '위험 부담'을 강조하는 표현이다.\n엔젤투자자분이 Exit을 원하실 때 회사를 대신해서 그 주식을 더 높은 가격에 매입했다.\n매년 스톡옵션을 행사했다.\n인프런의 미래에 현재 집 보증금 보다 더 많은 개인 현금이 투자되었다.\n회사가 이대로 성장하지 못하고 고꾸러지면 그 모든 것이 0원이 되니 개인적으로 큰 위험이 발생한다.\n(와이프를 설득하고 진행했다)\n팀원들에게 매번 인프런은 잘 될 것이라고, 믿으라고 하면서 정작 나는 안전한 곳에서, 절대 손해보지 않는 포지션에 있으면 안된다고 생각했다.\n인생의 중요한 시기를 인프런에 베팅한 팀원들이다.\n그들에게 더 당당하게 같은 게임의 참가자로서 이야기 하고 싶었다.\n\n\n계산기를 두드려야할 때와 그렇지 않은 때가 있다.\n다만, 이 지점에서는 두드리면 안되는 것 같았다.\n그러면 나는 더이상 멋진 삶을 살기 힘들 것 같은 느낌이 들었다.\n진심으로 인프런이 멋진 이야기가 될 것으로 믿고 있다.\n40살\n예전엔 스타트업이 멋지고 힙하다는 생각을 했다.\n근데 요즘은 더이상 멋져 보이지 않는다.\n특히나 예전의 멋진 스타트업들이 더이상 그 멋짐을 유지 못하는 것도 계속 보게 된다.\n\n\n대기업의 하루 예산도 안되는 돈 때문에 아쉬운 이야기를 해야하고,\n지표가 오르지 않을 때는 모든 것이 문제처럼 보이기 시작하고,\n전문성 살리는 일은 거의 없고, 항상 어설프게 빨리 완성하는 것에 집중한다.\n그럼에도 여전히 스타트업엔 낭만이 있다.\n그런 낭만에 이끌려 온 사람들과 함께하는 여정은 그 무엇보다도 큰 보상이다.\n스킨 인 더 게임을 한다고 했지만,\n나한테는 큰 리스크는 아니다.\n설령 내 돈이 모두 0원이 되더라도, 나의 30대를 이들과 함께 했던 여정이 보상이다.\n올해 40이 되었다.\n30~35세까지는 배민에서,\n35세부터는 인프런에서 함께 하고 있다.\n30대의 모든 여정을 스타트업에서 보낸 셈이다.\n30대에는 이만큼 즐겁게 일할 수 있을까 싶었는데, 요즘은 그때보다 훨씬 더 재밌다.\n40대는 30대보다 더 행복하고 즐거울 것 같다.\n주변의 모든 분들에게 감사하다.",
