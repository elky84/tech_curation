        "content:encodedSnippet": "ExecuTorch is the PyTorch inference framework for edge devices developed by Meta with support from industry leaders like Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm. \nRunning machine learning (ML) models on-device is increasingly important for Meta’s family of apps (FoA). These on-device models improve latency, maintain user privacy by keeping data on users’ devices, and enable offline functionality.\nWe’re showcasing some of the on-device AI features, powered by ExecuTorch, that are serving billions of people on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook.\nThese rollouts have significantly improved the performance and efficiency of on-device ML models in Meta’s FoA and eased the research to production path.\nOver the past year, we’ve rolled out ExecuTorch, an open-source solution for on-device inference on mobile and edge devices, across our family of apps (FoA) and seen significant improvements in model performance, privacy enhancement, and latency over our previous on-device machine learning (ML) stack.\nExecuTorch was built in collaboration with industry leaders and uses PyTorch 2.x technologies to convert models into a stable and compact representation for efficient on-device deployment. Its compact runtime, modularity, and extensibility make it easy for developers to choose and customize components – ensuring portability across platforms, compatibility with PyTorch, and high performance.\nAdopting ExecuTorch has helped us enhance our user experiences in our products and services used by billions of people all over the world.\nThe following are just a few examples of the various ML models on our apps on Android and iOS devices that ExecuTorch supports.\nEnabling Cutouts on Instagram\nCutouts is one of Instagram’s latest features for creative expression and storytelling. It lets people transform photos and videos of their favorite moments into animated, personalized stickers that they can share via Reels or Stories. We migrated the Cutouts feature in Instagram to run with ExecuTorch by enabling SqueezeSAM, a lightweight version of the Meta Segment Anything Model (SAM). For both Android and iOS, ExecuTorch was significantly faster compared to the older stack, translating into increases in Cutouts’ daily active users (DAU). \nExecuTorch enables Instagram’s Cutouts feature to run faster and more efficiently for both on-device sticker generation (left) and creating overlays on a photo. (right)\nImproving video and call quality on WhatsApp\nWhatsApp needs to be usable and reliable regardless of your network connection bandwidth. To achieve this, we developed bandwidth estimation models, tailored for various platforms. These models help detect and utilize available network bandwidth, optimizing video streaming quality without compromising the smoothness of video calls.  \nThese models need to be highly accurate and run as efficiently as possible. By leveraging ExecuTorch, we have observed improvements for the bandwidth estimation models in performance, reliability, and efficiency metrics. Specifically, we reduced the model load time and average inference time substantially while reducing app not responsive (ANR) metrics. Along the way, we further strengthened  security guarantees compared to the older PyTorch mobile framework by adding fuzzing tests, which involve supplying invalid or random inputs to a program and monitoring for exceptions. With the positive signal from these releases, we are now migrating several other key WhatsApp models, such as ones for on-device noise-canceling and video enhancement, to ExecuTorch as well. \nHere, Messenger’s language identification model (Lid) restricts the prompt language to English for Meta AI’s Imagine feature.\nShipping on-device ML for end-to-end encryption on Messenger\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Messenger ensures that no one except you and the people you’re talking to can see your messages, not even Meta. ExecuTorch has enabled E2EE on Messenger by moving server side models to run on-device, allowing data transfers to remain encrypted.\nTo enable E2EE, we migrated and deployed several models, including an on-device language identification (LID) model on Messenger. LID is a Messenger model that detects the language of given text and enables various downstream tasks, including translation, message summarization, and personalized content recommendations. With ExecuTorch, on-device LID is significantly faster and conserves server and network capacity. \nTo preserve Messenger’s E2EE environment, we have also leveraged ExecuTorch to move other Messenger models on-device, including one for optimizing video calling quality (similar to WhatsApp’s bandwidth estimation models) and another for image cutouts (similar to Cutouts on Instagram). These shifts resulted in improved infrastructure efficiency by freeing up capacity and enabling us to scale these features globally. \nBackground music recommendations for Facebook\nFacebook employs a core AI model called SceneX that performs a variety of tasks, including image recognition/categorization, captioning, creating AI-generated backgrounds for images, and image safety checks. Shifting SceneX to ExecuTorch now allows it to enhance people’s Facebook Stories by suggesting background music based on images.\nWith the ExecuTorch rollout, we saw performance improvements in SceneX across the board from low- to high-end devices compared to the older stack. Several other models, including which enhance image quality and perform background noise reduction during calls, are now in various stages of A/B testing. \nBuilding the future of on-device AI with the ExecuTorch Community\nWe hope the results we’ve seen leveraging ExecuTorch to help solve some of Meta’s on-device ML challenges at scale will be encouraging to the rest of the industry. We invite you to contribute to ExecuTorch and share feedback on our GitHub page. You can also join our growing community on the ExecuTorch Discord server.\nWe look forward to driving more innovation in on-device ML and shaping the future of on-device AI together with the community.\nThe post Accelerating on-device ML on Meta’s family of apps with ExecuTorch appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Rust and Java couldn’t be any more different. One is a battle-tested giant with enterprise-scale use cases. The other is a relative newbie with a rapidly growing community and real-world applications. \n\n\n\n\nWhile Rust is praised for its focus on safety and performance, its complexity presents a challenge to adopters (arguably, the steep learning curve is why so many developers love it!). In contrast, Java remains a cornerstone language thanks to its maturity and widespread use.\nIn this comparison, we dive into the strengths and trade-offs of each language to help you choose the best fit for your next project.\nRust vs. Java: Which one dominates in 2025?\nData from the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2024 clearly illustrates the differences between Rust and Java in market share and adoption. Rust achieved a milestone in 2024 with a user base of about 2.27 million developers, including 709,000 who use it as their primary language. Unsurprisingly, Java continues to attract tens of millions of developers globally due to its maturity and robust ecosystem. \nRust and Java usage patterns since 2018\nWhile Java usage share has remained relatively stable, you can see a noticeable drop since 2023. This stands in contrast to Rust, which has been experiencing steady growth since 2021.\n\n\n\n\nRust adoption is growing\nMost respondents to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2024 said they planned to use Go and Rust. Interestingly, one out of every six Go users is considering switching to Rust. Rust is also one of the three indisputable leaders in the JetBrains Language Promise Index.\nWhat about Rust’s commercial adoption?\nRust is gaining commercial traction, thanks to its emphasis on memory safety, efficiency, and security. While it’s still a minor player when compared to giants like Java, JavaScript, and Python, it has seen a big increase in enterprise development. In a recent survey, 45% of respondents stated that their organisation makes non-trivial use of Rust, a seven percentage point increase from 2023.\n\nRust in 2025: The most-admired programming language\nHow mature is Rust? Quick overview of Rust’s evolution\nA Mozilla developer, Graydon Hoare, started working on Rust as a side project in 2006. The language was officially funded by Mozilla Research in 2009 with the goal of creating a safer, concurrent, and practical language that could compete with C++ in terms of performance while ensuring higher security and thread safety. \nRust went through multiple iterations before launching its first stable release, Rust 1.0, in May 2015. The language was developed with contributions from a dedicated open-source community, and it’s constantly expanded with compiler enhancements and features focused on ensuring safety and efficiency.\nRust developers like to stay on top of these advancements and tend to use the latest release of the language: the vast majority of developers surveyed in the 2024 State of Rust Survey said they used the current stable version.\nCore philosophy of Rust \nThe fundamental principle of Rust is to guarantee memory safety without garbage collection and parallelism without data races. To this end, the Rust compiler enforces the “ownership” and “borrowing” concepts at build time. \nThe strict implementation of memory safety rules means that Rust apps don’t contain null pointer dereferences, dangling pointers, or buffer overflows, which are typical weaknesses in system-level programming languages like C and C++. Rust also stresses zero-cost abstractions, iterator chains, and type inference, enabling high-level programming without losing efficiency.\nPopular Rust use cases \nSystem-level software – Operating systems, embedded systems, and other foundational software that require tight control over hardware and resources are good use cases for Rust. Its ability to assure memory safety and parallelism makes it an ideal choice for creating reliable and high-performance system-level software.\nWebAssembly – Given its performance characteristics, Rust is becoming a popular choice for WebAssembly, particularly online applications that require high-speed performance beyond what standard JavaScript can provide. This use case is growing as the web matures into a platform for more complicated and performance-critical applications.\nCommand-line interfaces (CLIs) – Rust is a popular choice for building command-line interfaces because it compiles to efficient binary code, making CLI tools fast and reliable. Using Rust, developers can build command-line apps that require high performance, accurate error control, and cross-platform compatibility.\nGame dev – Game developers are turning more and more to Rust because of its efficiency, memory safety, and concurrency characteristics, making it a viable option for both independent and AAA projects. While C++ dominates the scene, Rust provides a compelling alternative with the promise of faster development cycles and less troubleshooting.\nWeb3 – Rust is gaining popularity in Web3 thanks to its performance, safety, and concurrency characteristics, making it a good choice for decentralised applications, smart contracts, and blockchain infrastructure. Its emphasis on memory security is consistent with Web3 requirements of trust and reliability.\nJava in 2025: 30 years of Write Once, Run Anywhere\nJava: A short history\nJava’s origins can be traced back to 1991, when Sun Microsystems’ James Gosling led a team to develop a language for consumer electronic devices. Initially known as “Oak,” the company eventually renamed it as Java – a reference to a particular coffee variety – and released it in 1995. That’s right, Java is celebrating its 30th birthday this year! \nHow did the language gain so much traction? The key to Java’s popularity is its platform independence, achieved thanks to compiling code into bytecode, which the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) then interprets. This is called Write Once, Run Anywhere; you can write and execute code on any system that supports the JVM. \nCore philosophy of Java\nApart from Write Once, Run Anywhere, another fundamental concept of Java is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which lets developers organise code into classes and objects, making it more modular, reusable, and scalable. Java also rigorously adheres to the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle, which ensures that common logic is written once (like in parent classes or utility methods) and used throughout the application. This gives you code that’s easy to maintain and debug.\nWhat is Java used for today?\nEnterprise software – Giants such as Amazon, Google, Netflix, and many Fortune 500 companies continue to rely heavily on Java to power services that millions of people use every day. This is possible because Java has evolved with the times, introducing new capabilities and frameworks that keep it relevant in the age of cloud-native, microservices-based systems.\nAndroid app development – Java is the primary language used to develop the logic and functionality of Android applications. It’s backed by a strong community and rich resources. While Kotlin is now Google’s recommended language for Android, Java is still used a lot, especially in existing projects and among engineers with prior knowledge. \nWeb services – Java has also been a go-to language for developers building web services; applications that connect client and server applications via standard protocols.\nBig Data – Java applications are scalable and can handle massive amounts of data, ensuring that Big Data applications operate without failure thanks to its robustness. Java comes with solid Big Data tools and frameworks, including Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka.\nRust vs. Java: Differences across ecosystem, tooling, and community\nTechnical differences between Rust and Java\nRuntime\nJava is built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which offers a vast and mature runtime environment with capabilities such as garbage collection, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, and extensive standard libraries. This makes it ideal for cross-platform development and quick iteration. However, this has an overhead in terms of memory utilisation and startup time. \nIn contrast, Rust provides a minimal runtime (zero-cost abstractions), which means that its abstractions compile down to very efficient machine code with no additional runtime cost. It lacks a garbage collector, allowing developers to fine-tune memory and speed, making it excellent for systems programming and performance-critical applications.\nPerformance\nWhen it comes to performance, Rust is designed to deliver predictable, high-speed execution thanks to its lack of garbage collection and fine-grained control over memory and system resources. This is why Rust is a strong choice for performance-critical tasks like game engines, operating systems, or embedded systems. \nJava, on the other hand, relies on the JVM’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler to optimise performance at runtime. While JIT can lead to impressive speeds for long-running In latency-sensitive scenarios, applications built with Java may experience longer startup times and unpredictable pauses caused by garbage collection, which can lead to less consistent performance.\nMemory management\nMemory management in Java is fully automatic and handled by the garbage collector, which frees developers from manually managing memory but can introduce unpredictable pauses during execution. \nRust takes a different approach, enforcing memory safety at compile time without a garbage collector. This means developers must explicitly manage memory, but the compiler guarantees safety and prevents common bugs like null pointer dereferencing or data races, offering both performance and reliability without runtime overhead.\nLearning curve differences\nJava offers a lower learning curve for most beginners, particularly those who are comfortable with object-oriented programming. Its syntax is simple, and the extensive ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and mature documentation makes it accessible. The breadth of Java’s APIs can be intimidating at first, but it also means that learners can find tools and courses for almost every problem. Official Java tutorials, JetBrains Academy, and communities such as Stack Overflow and r/java are all great places to start.\nIn comparison, Rust has a steeper initial learning curve, owing primarily to its ownership concept and borrow checker. These impose tight memory safety guidelines, which might be frustrating for newbies. Many developers are unfamiliar with concepts such as lifetimes and borrowing, which require a mentality shift, particularly for those coming from garbage-collected languages. However, these limits bring you stable and efficient code. \nFortunately, the Rust community is known for its friendliness and extensive learning resources. The Rust Book, Rustlings, the Rust Users Forum, r/rust, and the official Discord server are all good places to start. JetBrains Academy provides hands-on learning for Rust as well.\nTake Rust Course\n                                                    \nIn essence, Java provides a more familiar path with broad-reaching capabilities, whereas Rust requires more upfront but pays with efficiency, safety, and control.\nTooling and ecosystem differences\nIn terms of tooling and general developer experience, Rust and Java both provide solid but distinct ecosystems that impact developer productivity.\nIntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)\nJava IDEs – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans – provide developers with tools for code completion, debugging, refactoring, and project management by default. IntelliJ IDEA, in particular, is well known for its extensive integration with Java technology and intelligent support.\nTry IntelliJ IDEA\n                                                    \nRust has made significant progress in IDE support. There’s RustRover, and IntelliJ IDEA also supports Rust through a plugin, which adds many of the usual productivity benefits that Java developers are accustomed to. \nTry RustRover\n                                                    \nBuild systems and package managers\nRust’s unified toolchain includes Cargo, which serves as a build system, package manager, and dependency manager. It’s straightforward, consistent, and widely commended for making Rust projects simple to initiate, develop, test, and publish.\nIn contrast, Java includes several build tools, the most popular of which are Maven and Gradle. Maven is XML-based and structured, but Gradle provides greater flexibility with Groovy or Kotlin-based scripts. Despite their maturity and strength, these tools can be more complex and require more configuration compared to Cargo’s “batteries-included” solution.\nDebugging and profiling tools\nBuilding on decades of work, Java has mature debugging and profiling tools, including VisualVM, JProfiler, and built-in IDE features. Garbage collection logs, memory profiling, and thread analysis are all fully supported.\nRust debugging relies on tools such as GDB or LLDB, with increasing support from IDEs and third-party tools. While strong, these tools might be more low-level and demand a deeper understanding of systems programming ideas. The ecosystem is evolving, but Java’s tooling remains more mature and user-friendly for large-scale applications.\nDeveloper experience\nJava provides a sophisticated, enterprise-grade programming experience. Java’s robust tooling and decades of refinement make it ideal for teams and large-scale systems, enabling high developer productivity.\nRust’s experience is more modern, simplified, and community-focused. Cargo’s stability, informative compiler messages, and improved IDE support make it pleasurable to use after the initial learning curve. It’s especially appealing to developers who prioritise safety, efficiency, and simple tooling workflows, particularly for greenfield projects and performance-critical applications.\nCommunity and adoption differences\nCommunity size and activity\nJava is one of the largest and most mature programming communities in the world. After decades of growth, its ecosystem now includes extensive online forums (such as Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Oracle communities), conferences (such as JavaOne and Devoxx), and big open-source contributions across practically every domain, solidifying its status as a mainstream language.\nRust’s community may be new, but it’s active, enthusiastic, and rapidly increasing. Its open development model (hosted on GitHub with community RFCs) promotes openness and collaboration. Rust also runs its conferences, such as RustConf, and maintains active forums, Discord servers, and a significant presence on sites such as users.rust-lang.org and Reddit’s r/rust. The community is bound to grow: even if not many developers are currently using Rust, a lot of them (11%) plan to adopt it in comparison to Java (4%).\nLibraries and frameworks\n​​Java has a large ecosystem of libraries and frameworks. Spring, Jakarta EE, and Micronaut are among the most popular frameworks for enterprise web development. While Java is not as popular in data science as Python, libraries like ND4J and DeepLearning4J, as well as interaction with big data platforms such as Apache Hadoop and Spark, make it viable. Java is the foundation of Android development via the Android SDK (though Kotlin has grabbed the lead in recent years).\nRust’s library ecosystem is still expanding, although it is already robust in some areas. Web development frameworks such as Actix and Axum are gaining popularity. Rust excels at systems programming, particularly with crates for embedded development, game engines, and performance-critical tooling. Rust, on the other hand, is still in its early stages and trails more established languages in data science and GUI/mobile programming.\nIndustry adoption and job market trends\nJava continues to be a highly sought-after language, with opportunities in enterprise software, Android, and backend development. Its endurance means that experienced Java developers remain in high demand, particularly in banking, enterprise IT, and large-scale backend services.\nRust’s job market is modest but rising rapidly. Companies like Mozilla, Dropbox, Amazon, Microsoft, and Cloudflare use it for performance-critical or security-sensitive applications. While Rust has fewer job opportunities than Java, it’s becoming increasingly popular in fields such as systems programming, blockchain, developer tools, and game development. \nInterestingly, according to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2024, the share of top-paid employees by programming language for Rust is an impressive 27% – only 3% less than for Java (30%).\nDo Java and Rust have anything in common?\nMemory safety\nBoth languages aim to prevent common memory-related bugs (such as null pointer exceptions, buffer overflows, and use-after-free errors) that frequently occur in C/C++.\nThe JVM in Java automatically manages memory by cleaning up unused objects at runtime. This simplifies memory management for developers but introduces runtime overhead and potential pauses.\nRust achieves this through its ownership and borrowing system: this model enforces strict rules at compile time, ensuring memory safety without requiring a runtime garbage collector. It provides C/C++-like performance without the need for manual memory management.\nConcurrency support\nBoth languages provide robust mechanisms for writing concurrent and parallel software, which are essential for modern multi-core processors and scalable applications.\nJava uses traditional threads, the java.util.concurrent package (including Executors, Concurrent Collections, and Locks), and synchronisation mechanisms like the synchronised keyword. \nRust emphasises “fearless concurrency” by using its ownership and type system to prevent data races at compile time. This allows developers to write safe concurrent code without relying on a garbage collector. Rust also supports asynchronous programming using async/await and high-performance libraries like Tokio for building scalable, non-blocking applications.\nCross-platform capability\nJava achieves Write Once, Run Anywhere through the JVM, which allows Java bytecode to run on any operating system that has a compatible JVM. This abstraction layer enables strong cross-platform portability without recompilation.\nRust, on the other hand, compiles to native machine code for a wide range of platforms, offering high performance and fine-grained control. Additionally, Rust is increasingly used with WebAssembly, enabling cross-platform execution in web browsers and server-side environments, further extending its reach beyond traditional native targets.\nModern language features\nBoth languages support advanced concepts such as generics and functional programming paradigms – for example, Rust emphasises immutability by default, while Java offers streams and lambda expressions. They also provide robust error-handling mechanisms. Additionally, both have strong static type systems that help catch many errors at compile time, improving code safety and reliability.\nBackend or server-side\nBoth languages are widely used for building high-performance backend services, APIs, and microservices. However, Java has a much longer history and a larger footprint in this space, particularly within enterprise environments, where its mature ecosystem and extensive frameworks remain dominant.\nRust vs. Java: Which one should you pick?\nWhen is Rust the clear winner?\nRust shines in scenarios requiring low-level control, performance, and memory safety. It’s the obvious choice for system development (OS, device drivers), high-performance computing, and creating fast command-line tools. \nRust’s ability to compile to WebAssembly makes it perfect for producing secure, quick code for browsers or serverless environments. Any application that requires little runtime overhead, predictable performance, and guaranteed memory safety – without a garbage collector – is a good fit for Rust.\nWhen is Java the best choice?\nJava excels in large-scale enterprise applications where stability, maintainability, and a robust ecosystem are critical. It’s the language for Android smartphone development, online services, and large data processing systems such as Hadoop and Spark. \nJava’s extensive collection of mature libraries and frameworks, together with its Write Once, Run Anywhere universality, make it ideal for microservices architectures and rapid development cycles that require developer productivity and cross-platform support.\nInteroperability\nRust and Java can be used together for applications that require both Rust’s performance and safety, as well as Java’s ecosystem and portability. You can do that using Java Native Interface (JNI), which allows Java programs to access Rust libraries compiled as native binaries. \nWhile interoperability adds complexity, this strategy allows developers to integrate Rust’s high-performance components into existing Java programs, using the capabilities of both languages. And it’s definitely doable: 15% of developers use Java together with their Rust projects.\nWrap up\nBy 2025, Rust has established itself as the language of choice for systems programming, WebAssembly, and performance-critical applications, thanks to a rapidly growing and devoted developer community. Its emphasis on memory safety and zero-cost abstractions continues to draw developers seeking modern, dependable alternatives to C and C++. \nJava continues to dominate enterprise software, Android development, and large-scale backend systems due to its extensive ecosystem, mature tooling, and widespread industry usage. \nTo sum up, Java is the leader in terms of community size, tooling maturity, and employment availability, while Rust, although newer, is quickly building a passionate community, developing library support, and carving out a solid niche in performance-focused apps.\nAre you curious to see how Rust measures up to another popular language, Go?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I’ll start by acknowledging that you probably already do.\nAnd honestly? We get it. Programming is hard! Learning materials can be poorly structured and lack good visualizations. Sometimes your teacher is a math genius who is bad at talking. And hey, AI is pretty capable for beginner-level problems. It can make the implementation much faster for some learners, but for others it can actually make everything worse.\nThis post isn’t meant to wag fingers or shame anyone. We just want learners to be smart about the way they use new technology – especially one as impactful on the learning process as LLMs. Indeed, sometimes getting the best learning experience may mean not using AI, but sometimes it just means using it slightly differently.\nThis is part three in our series How to Learn to Code in an AI World. Don’t miss the first, Is it Still Worth Learning to Code?, and second, Learning to Think in an AI World: 5 Lessons for Novice Programmers.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get right to it: Should you use AI when learning to program?\nOur answer is best expressed as a graph:\n\n\n\n\nIn short, the more of a beginner you are, the less you should use AI to generate code for you. \nThere are a lot of reasons for this, namely:\nSkipping the basics makes understanding harder concepts more difficult.\nYou accept more bad suggestions because your code reading skills are not developed.\nIt speeds you up, which is good for productivity but bad for knowledge retention.\nYou feel less ownership over your work, which decreases motivation.\nThe experience of programming becomes “flatter” – a solution given to you is less satisfying than one you worked for.\nIt messes with your perception of how much you know in the following ways:\n\nYou lose self-confidence and feel like you can’t code without AI assistance\nYou develop delusionally high self-confidence, where you feel like you’re a great programmer, even though AI is doing most of the work, and you barely understand how a for loop works.\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t use AI to help you follow your curiosity and increase your motivation to learn things yourself. You can ask it to generate metaphors for challenging abstract concepts, ask questions if no human teacher is available, clarify terms that confuse you, and even get advice on a personal project that is slightly out of your depth.\nIf positive reinforcement isn’t working, try asking your AI to be mean to you.\n\n\n\nStill, we would generally advise caution when interacting with LLMs that aren’t specifically tailored for education. Research shows people are very bad at realizing when AI is replacing their thinking rather than augmenting it.\nChoosing between no AI, an AI made for learning, or going all in is difficult. In the next part, we’ll go a bit deeper into the pros and cons of each of these options.\nNon-AI materials and tutors\nInconvenient, but better for knowledge retention and accuracy\nNon-AI materials require us to commit to the active process of digging through books, documentation, and forums to find answers. It can take much longer compared to prompting an LLM, but the benefit is that it fully engages us in our own learning (as long as it doesn’t ruin our motivation by being too boring). Our brains interpret the additional time as a sign of importance, which in turn enhances our memory of what we learned. Moreover, we might stumble upon unexpected gems in a way that’s difficult with AI-generated answers.\nLet’s also not overlook the human element here: a skilled teacher can offer a personal perspective that significantly outweighs the convenience of AI. Through good teachers we learn to love a subject and believe in ourselves, profoundly impacting the experience of learning and our long-term motivation.\nTake, for instance, our completely human-made animated guide to Git!\n\n\n\nAI tutors\nExtremely convenient but hard to get right in practice\nUsually, when we interact with AI, we’re looking for a quick and easy answer. Even when it’s engineered to prompt us to do some thinking on our own, we tend to unconsciously skip over those questions and shortcut to the solution. It requires a lot of willpower to slow down and truly digest the information AI gives us, not to mention reflect and relate it to previous things we’ve learned, and finally, understand how to apply it in practice.\nIf you’re good at making yourself slow down and think, then tutor away! But, if you find yourself spending most of your time prompting, skimming, and rushing toward output – skipping the high-level thinking parts of coding – then we’d recommend you take a break from AI and find ways to allow for more thoughtful reflection into your practice.\nAI tutors can help spark your curiosity if you’re having trouble connecting with the material.\n\n\n\nAI assistants\nGreat for doing things, less great for learning things; to use them wisely requires a strong foundation\nThere are as many opinions on the best way to use an AI assistant as there are software developers. Some use it every time they code and some prefer a whiteboard and a rubber duck. Over time you’ll learn your preference and style. The important thing is for you to figure out how to write quality code quickly and in a way that feels good.\nIf you do use it, we definitely recommend spending some focused time learning best practices – like any technology, it takes some intention to learn to use it well. See our course catalog for free courses like Coding with AI assistant or Prompting to debug and fix AI-generated code.\nCode completion should only be used when you’ve developed a strong foundation.\n\n\n\nIn summary, while AI tools are incredibly convenient, it’s crucial for beginners to exercise caution. Overreliance on AI for code generation can hinder foundational understanding, knowledge retention, and intrinsic motivation.\nThe best approach involves balancing AI assistance with traditional learning methods, fostering computational thinking, and staying smart about when you use it. Ultimately, the effectiveness of AI in your coding journey depends on your learning style, current skill level, and how thoughtfully you integrate these powerful tools.\nGet a free student license\n                                                                Explore our course catalog\n                                    \nThis is the third post in our series How to Learn to Program in an AI World.

But here’s the critical truth every developer and team lead should understand: using AI tools is not the same as understanding AI agents. That’s why we created the course AI Agents as Your Team. It’s a hands-on, real-world roadmap to understanding how AI agents actually work—and how you can work with them.\nTake the Course for Free\n                                                    \nIt’s Time to Think Like an AI Agent Collaborator\n2025 is the year software teams go into post-human mode. Every engineer will soon have a few tireless digital teammates running tests, writing patches, and signaling for help only when truly needed.\nAndrew Zakonov, the course creator and AI Product Leader at JetBrains\nAI agents are no longer sci-fi—they’re here. But so is the danger: when we don’t understand how they operate, we treat them like black boxes—trusting them blindly or avoiding them altogether. This course pulls back the curtain, helping you demystify AI agents and move beyond simply observing their outputs.\nYou’ll gain a foundational understanding of:\nHow Agents Are Built: The architecture of LLM-powered agents and how they actually work under the hood.\nMaximizing Productivity: Practical strategies and “playbooks” for potentially achieving a 10x increase with today’s AI agent technology.\nNavigating Risks: The challenges that come with using AI agents and actionable ways to mitigate them, ensuring responsible adoption.\nStaying Ahead: How to navigate the fast-paced AI landscape as new models and agents continue to emerge.\nBuilt by Builders — JetBrains and Nebius\nWhat makes this course stand out isn’t just the curriculum. It’s who built it:\nJetBrains: The team behind IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and now Junie, a deeply context-aware coding agent built for professionals.\nNebius: Experts in scalable, AI-first cloud infrastructure.\nWe’re not just creating AI products, we’re actively contributing to the industry’s growth, awareness and cutting-edge education. Our engineers understand the real stakes of working with intelligent systems—performance, trust, transparency, and productivity. \nThe course reflects that mindset. \nYou’ll see how Junie works and what makes an agent truly useful. It’s the kind of insight that changes how you write code—and how you think about your tools.\nWho Should Enroll\nThis course isn’t just about speeding up tasks; it’s about architecting better workflows, navigating complex AI systems, and building safe, observable co-creators. This is foundational knowledge for anyone who cares about developer experience, AI literacy, or technical leadership.\nTake this course if you:\nFeel AI creeping into your stack and want to stay ahead of the curve.\nAre mentoring devs who need better guidance than “just use ChatGPT.”\nWant to explore agent orchestration, prompt engineering, or agent UIs.\nAre serious about integrating tools like Junie into your production workflow.\nIt’s like getting extra developers to your team! If you spend time now learning how these agents plan, loop through feedback, and expose the handful of decisions that still need you, that time will pay off in every task that follows.\nAndrew Zakonov, the course creator and AI Product Leader at JetBrains\nWhy Now\nThere’s no prize for being first, but there’s a cost to being last. AI Agents as Your Team is free right now, a rare opportunity to gain insights companies typically reserve for private training. If you’re even thinking about working with AI professionally, do yourself a favor and seize this chance while it’s open. We’re recommending it to our teams, and we hope you’ll join us.\nStart Now",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Build steps are often repeated over and over – within a single project or team, or even across a whole organization. These patterns tend to get copy-pasted, manually adapted, and maintained in parallel. This can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work.\nWith the latest TeamCity release, we’re addressing that problem head-on. Say hello to TeamCity recipes: customizable build steps that can be reused, versioned, and published on the JetBrains Marketplace (or used internally in your organization).\nWhether you’re managing dozens of pipelines or just want to save time setting up repeatable build logic, recipes are designed to streamline your CI/CD workflows. Let’s take a closer look at what recipes are about.\nWhat are TeamCity recipes?\nRecipes are build steps you can save and reuse whenever you need to repeat the same setup. They help you avoid reinventing the wheel by letting you define and reuse common build logic.\nTeamCity recipes on JetBrains Marketplace\n\n\n\nRecipes can be:\nPublic, shared on the JetBrains Marketplace.\nPrivate, shared within a specific TeamCity project or organization.\nEach recipe can include configurable parameters, documentation, and versioning, making them easy to integrate and maintain.\nFor more information about what recipes are and how they’re different from meta runners, please refer to our documentation.\nWhat’s new in this release?\nPublic contributions via the JetBrains Marketplace\nFor the first time, external users can publish their own recipes to the JetBrains Marketplace. This opens the door to a community-driven ecosystem of reusable build logic, maintained and shared by TeamCity users around the world.\nTo upload your own recipes to the Marketplace, follow these steps.\nRedesigned recipe installation UI\nOur new interface provides a more user-friendly installation experience:\nView author details and recipe versions.\nInstall specific versions.\nPreview source code before installing.\nExample of a TeamCity recipe\n\n\n\nThis transparency ensures that users can review and trust third-party contributions.\nYAML support for private recipes\nPreviously known as meta runners, private recipes can now be written in YAML. This modern syntax improves readability and maintainability. While XML is still supported for backward compatibility, YAML is now the recommended format.\nUnified UI for recipe management\nManage both public and private recipes from a single interface:\nUpload and organize private recipes at the project level.\nView usage across build configurations and templates (including private recipes).\nDetect outdated or unavailable recipes that could break builds.\n\n\n\n\nWhy use TeamCity recipes?\nWhether you’re reusing steps within your organization or using recipes created within your organization or outside of it, this feature offers a practical way to reduce duplication and simplify maintenance.\nPublic recipes give you access to a growing library of build steps created by the TeamCity community. Because each recipe is a small, self-contained file with visible source code, you can review what it does before using it. \nPrivate recipes, on the other hand, help teams standardize their internal workflows. Written in YAML, they’re easier to read, edit, and debug compared to older XML-based meta runners. And because they’re scoped to your TeamCity project or organization, they stay private and secure.\nBoth public and private recipes are easier to create and share than full-fledged plugins, lowering the barrier to contribution.\nBuilt for safety\nThe idea behind recipes might feel familiar: many CI tools offer reusable build logic. But with TeamCity Recipes, we’ve taken a more opinionated approach to how they’re configured, shared, and executed, focusing strongly on security, transparency, and ease of use.\nUnlike some other ecosystems, TeamCity doesn’t default to using floating versions like latest, which can introduce unintentional changes into your builds. When you install a recipe, you choose a specific version, giving you more control and predictability.\nWhen a new version becomes available, TeamCity will notify you, but won’t auto-upgrade anything without your knowledge and permission.\nEvery public recipe comes with visible source code you can inspect directly from the TeamCity UI before installing and from the overview page after the installation. Once installed, the build step editor automatically adapts to the Recipe’s parameters, presenting clear controls and descriptions instead of relying on manual text input. \nThis makes Recipes not only easier to trust, but also easier to configure and debug, especially for teams that value visibility and safety.\nHow to publish a recipe\nPublishing a recipe is simple:\nLog in to the JetBrains Marketplace.\nChoose “TeamCity Recipes” as the plugin type.\nUpload your recipe with metadata and namespace (to avoid naming collisions). Namespaces allow multiple users to publish recipes with the same name under different scopes.\n\n\n\n\nPlease also refer to our documentation for more information on how to upload a new recipe.\nGive it a try\nRecipes are now live in TeamCity. Browse the Marketplace, experiment with public recipes, or create your own to simplify and supercharge your CI/CD pipelines.\nWe believe this feature will help foster a more vibrant, collaborative TeamCity community, and we can’t wait to see what you build 🚀\nStay tuned for upcoming tutorials and videos showcasing what’s possible with recipes!",

It lets you choose from three modes, depending on how aggressive or conservative you want to be:\nNone – No fixes are applied. Use this option if you want reporting only.\nCleanup – This option applies safe, non-invasive cleanup inspections (like removing unused imports, reformatting, etc.) that don’t change logic or behavior.\nApply – This option tries to fix all detected issues, including those that may affect logic or behavior. This is ideal for thorough refactoring, but it requires review before merging.\nThese modes give you fine-grained control over automation, from low-risk cosmetic cleanups to more substantial code rewrites.\nHow to run Quick-Fixes \nYou can enable a Quick-Fix strategy in a few environments:\nLocally via Docker or the Qodana CLI.\n\n\n\n\nIn your CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.\n\n\n\n\nVia configuration using qodana.yaml.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a basic example using Docker with the –apply-fixes flag:\n$ docker run \\\n   -v <source-directory>/:/data/project/  \\\n   -e QODANA_TOKEN=\"<cloud-project-token>\" \\\n   jetbrains/qodana-<linter> \\\n   --apply-fixes\nYou can set your strategy directly in the qodana.yaml file if you’re automating across environments.

But there’s plenty more under the hood, including network policy controls, usage limits, and a bunch of smaller but useful improvements.\nCursor support\nCursor is one of the fastest-growing IDEs today, built on top of VS Code and deeply integrated with AI tooling. Starting with CodeCanvas 2025.2, developers can use Cursor in their remote dev environments.\nFrom the administrator’s perspective, nothing changes. Cursor uses the same Remote SSH protocol as VS Code. To start using it, simply select Cursor from the list of supported IDEs when creating a dev environment template.\n\nKeep in mind:\nCodeCanvas always uses the latest version of Cursor. You can’t set it to a specific version.\nTo prevent compatibility issues, developers should keep Cursor updated on their machines.\nAll Cursor extensions are installed from the VS Code Marketplace, so existing VS Code plugin setups can usually be reused.\nJupyter notebooks\n\nJupyter is a popular tool for working with data, especially in data science and machine learning. It lets you combine code, output, and documentation in a single notebook interface. Running Jupyter in the cloud is a common need, especially for resource-heavy workloads. With CodeCanvas, this has always been technically possible. But in 2025.2, we’ve made it official.\nWe’ve documented the setup steps and explained how to make Jupyter work smoothly in dev environments.\nJupyter is currently supported only in VS Code.\nYou’ll need to install a few extensions and use life cycle scripts to start the Jupyter server.\nLearn how to set up Jupyter in CodeCanvas\nMore improvements in 2025.2\nBeyond support for Cursor and Jupyter, this release includes many other updates, from cost optimization to security hardening. Here are a few highlights:\nCost control tools\nConcurrent usage limits – You can now cap how many dev environments each user can run at the same time. Usage is tracked per instance type.\nAuto-disabling warm-up and standby pools – Standby pools and scheduled warm-ups are now automatically disabled after repeated failures or prolonged inactivity. This prevents unused resources from consuming capacity and cloud costs.\nBetter security\nNetwork policies – The operator Helm chart now supports configurable network policies. Two built-in policies are enabled by default:\n\nDenying all inbound traffic (including between dev environments)\nAllowing all outbound traffic\nYou can disable or change these policies, or define your own custom network policies to match your infrastructure and security needs.\nOther features\nCodeCanvas 2025.2 has even more to offer: non-root dev containers, per-namespace and per-template usage metrics, and more.\nSee the full list of features\nWhat can CodeCanvas do for your team?\nWant to learn more about the benefits of CDEs and whether they’re right for your organization?

This shift allows us to tackle long-standing issues and improve the overall experience of working with Bazel projects in JetBrains IDEs. As of July 2025, these plugins are no longer offered by, nor affiliated with, Google.\nWhat’s changing\nBazel for CLion: We’re continuing active development of the plugin with a focus on improving stability, addressing performance bottlenecks, and resolving the most common user-reported issues.\nBazel for IntelliJ: The plugin has been deprecated. JetBrains is maintaining it for now solely to keep it compatible with newer IntelliJ IDEA versions, but no new features will be added. The Bazel team has released a new plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, and PyCharm and is actively developing it. Read the blog post to learn more about it: Bazel Plugin Release: General Availability.\nWhat’s new in Bazel for CLion\nStarting with v2025.06.24.0.1, the plugin includes the first batch of improvements, particularly around the Virtual File System (VFS). We’ve started addressing the causes behind frequent Refreshing files dialogs and connection drops during remote development.\nTo ensure these fixes take effect in your IDE, update and then run the File | Invalidate Caches action with the Clear file system cache and Local History option selected.\nWhat’s next\nWe’re prioritizing the following areas:\nEnhanced custom toolchain support: We’re working on improving support for more complex project setups. This includes adding support for custom sysroots and introducing support for Clang-CL on Windows, which will give you more flexibility in your development environment.\nContinued VFS and performance issues: The initial fixes are just the beginning. Continued VFS optimization remains one of our highest priorities.\nBetter support for virtual includes: We’re also looking into providing better support for virtual includes and generated sources. We understand the importance of this for effectively navigating complex Bazel projects.\nLong-term vision\nOur goal is to eventually provide C and C++ support directly in the new JetBrains Bazel plugin. But before we can do that, two things must happen: The new plugin needs to have matured its Kotlin and Java support through wide real-world usage and user feedback, and we need to be able deliver the same comprehensive C and C++ experience that CLion users expect.\nIn the meantime, Bazel for CLion will continue to be fully supported and maintained.\nShare your feedback\nYour feedback is essential to making this transition successful and ensuring our improvements effectively address real-world challenges. If your project experiences the VFS symptoms we mentioned or relies on a custom toolchain that doesn’t work properly with the plugin, we want to hear from you. Please share your feedback in our issue tracker or in the comments below. Help us shape the future of Bazel at JetBrains!\nINSTALL CLION’S BAZEL PLUGIN",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Bazel Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Is Now Generally Available!\nAfter much anticipation, we are finally ready to announce the general availability (GA) of the new Bazel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and GoLand – now developed by JetBrains! After months of focused development and valuable feedback from our EAP users, we’re officially launching our revamped Bazel experience.\nWhile we’ve been shipping updates regularly, the leap to our 2025.2 GA release marks a major milestone. Even though our primary focus for this release was on creating the best experience we can for Java, Kotlin, and Scala developers, we also brought support for the Python and Go ecosystems, and we will continue to maintain and improve it in the coming releases.\nIf you’re migrating from the previous plugin originally released by Google, you’ll notice a more straightforward workflow that aligns with the standard JetBrains IDE experience you expect from other build tool integrations such as Maven and Gradle. Now, let’s dive into what’s new!\nKey features in 2025.2\n\nBazel Query in Action\nGo is a go. We’re officially rolling out support for Go. You can now import your Go targets in Bazel projects into both IntelliJ IDEA (with the Go plugin) and GoLand. This brings the full IDE experience you rely on: code highlighting, completion, navigation, and the ability to run, debug, and get coverage for your tests.\nBuilt-in Bazel Query tool window: Go beyond sync and build with Bazel queries integrated directly into your IDE via their own dedicated tool window. Craft your queries with syntax completion and a helpful UI for flags to explore your project’s dependency graph without ever leaving the editor.\nDramatically faster indexing: We’ve optimized indexing to get you to your code faster. You can now use the import_depth and import_ijars settings in your .bazelproject file to prevent the indexing of deep transitive dependencies and index only header jars instead of full jars. What’s more, only the files directly referenced in your .bazelproject view are fully indexed for code intelligence, which can slash indexing times and memory usage in large projects with many auxiliary files.\nNew plugin, new user experience\nBack in December, we publicly announced the EAP (Early Access Program) version of our new plugin and defined what it would take to release it into GA, with an overview of the main differences between the original plugin and the new one.\nHere’s a quick recap for those moving from the older plugin: We’ve smoothed out the rough edges to make Bazel feel like a natural part of the IDE.\nSimplified project import: The old import wizard is a thing of the past. Now, simply open a directory containing your MODULE.bazel or WORKSPACE file. For more control, you can open a specific .bazelproject view file. If you manage a large monorepo, you can provide a default template for your team by checking in a template at tools/intellij/.managed.bazelproject.\nRedesigned UI elements: The Bazel tool window is now your central hub for actions like resyncing your project (with a Build and Resync option for generating sources) and keeping track of targets in your working set. We’ve also added a widget listing all targets the currently opened file belongs to. It allows you to run actions on these targets (build / test / jump to BUILD file / copy target label)\nReworked target mapping for JVM projects: A core improvement is the new internal representation for JVM targets, which mirrors the actual Bazel graph. This fundamental change enables more accurate highlighting, more accurate completions and more reliable refactoring.\nImprovements since 2025.1\nWindows compatibility\nWe understand that development doesn’t just happen on one OS. That’s why we worked on making our plugin compatible with Microsoft Windows, bringing most of the feature set to our Windows-based users.\nEnhanced Bazel configuration support\nWe believe editing your build files should be as easy as editing your source code, which is why we’ve improved the user experience for all Bazel-related configuration files.\nStarlark (.bzl, BUILD)\n\nStarlark Quick Documentation\nQuick documentation for Starlark rules: Hover over a Starlark rule or function to see its documentation directly in the editor. You’ll also get documentation as you type, guiding you through available parameters.\nAutomatic formatting: If you have buildifier on your PATH, the plugin will now automatically format your Starlark files on save\nBazel module configuration file (MODULE.bazel)\nIntelligent editing: The MODULE.bazel editor now offers smart completions for arguments and displays documentation as you edit.\nBazel project view file (.bazelproject) \n\n.bazelproject view highlighting and completions\nGuided editing: Get completions for section names and known values. The editor will now highlight completely unsupported sections as errors and sections that are supported in the old plugin originally by Google (but not in the new one) as warnings.\nManage directories from the Project view file tree: You can now right-click a directory in the project tree to add or remove it from your .bazelproject file, thus loading or unloading that directory in IntelliJ.\nBazelisk configuration file (.bazelversion):\nStay up to date: The editor will now highlight outdated Bazel versions specified in your .bazelversion file and offer a quick-fix to update to the latest release.\nLanguage ecosystem enhancements\nJVM:\n\nThe underlying project model mapping has been further improved, resulting in better performance during sync and more reliable refactorings for targets where glob patterns match the whole directory.\nScala:\n\nThe Bazel plugin now respects the scalacopts parameter in your scala_* targets, which unlocks Scala 3 highlighting features with the -Xsource:3 flag. At the same time, we’ve updated the Scala plugin to provide native integration with the Bazel plugin out of the box.\nPython:\n\nRun from the gutter: py_test and py_binary targets now get the familiar green Run arrow in the editor gutter.\nImproved dependency resolution: Python dependencies are now resolved correctly, enabling code navigation and eliminating false error highlighting.\nInterpreter from MODULE.bazel: The plugin now sets the Python interpreter based on what is defined in MODULE.bazel. This includes support for hermetic toolchains downloaded by rules_python – meaning you don’t need to have Python installed locally on your machine.\nDebugging: You can now attach the debugger to py_test targets.\nWhat happens to the Bazel plugin by Google?\nThe Bazel for IntelliJ plugin (also known as IJwB) by Google is being deprecated. Google has transferred the code ownership and maintenance to JetBrains. We will keep providing compatibility updates for new IntelliJ versions and critical fixes only throughout the year of 2025, but will be fully deprecating it in 2026. All our development effort for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, and PyCharm is now focused on the new plugin.\nThe Bazel for CLion plugin (CLwB) has also been transferred to JetBrains, and will continue to be actively developed. Learn more in the post Enhancing Bazel Support for CLion on the CLion Blog.\nGot feedback? We’re listening!\nWe’re committed to making this the best Bazel experience possible. Please report any issues, ideas, or improvements straight to our issue tracker.\nFixed the problem yourself? We accept PRs on our hirschgarten repository.\nYou’ll also find us on the Bazel Community Slack, in the #intellij channel.\nHappy building!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In online learning environments, tasks can often stump students, which can be challenging to navigate since teachers can’t always be there to help. Our Education Research team develops innovative features for education tools and recently built a smart AI-based hints tool that provides personalized feedback for students who might need help solving tasks. This tool goes beyond the automated hints common in massive open online courses (MOOCs) and delivers tailored, effective guidance that helps students move forward. \nTry the plugin!\n                                    \nIn this post, we will:\nExplore the currently available options for automated assistance in MOOCs.\nPresent our AI-based hint system, showing how it works and what’s technically interesting about it.\nDiscuss how students evaluated the plugin and what’s up next in this research stream.\nLearning in online courses\nIn its early days, distance learning was intended for people who were unable to attend classroom lectures, usually full-time workers, military personnel, and those in remote regions. The model has been around for some centuries already: people could take so-called correspondence courses per post, documented as early as the 1720s in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Sir Isaac Pitman offered correspondence courses with feedback in the mid 1800s from Gloucestershire, UK, and universities were not far behind: students could obtain a degree through the University of London starting in 1858, regardless of whether they lived in London or not. \nLet’s zoom ahead to 2000, when online institutions like the University of Phoenix in the USA and The Open University in the UK had already been offering online courses to obtain degrees for about 30 years. As technology became more advanced and the infrastructure evolved for better access to affordable and fast internet, online courses surged in popularity.  \nThe importance of feedback\nThe first MOOC is often credited to Stephen Downes and George Siemens, who in 2008 made it possible for more than 2000 students online to attend their course in addition to the 25 students at the University of Manitoba campus in Canada. Since then, and especially during the pandemic, MOOCs have become more popular, with many available platforms. For example, there are platforms from universities like MIT and Harvard (their non-profit consortium is now edX and includes many more partners) and private companies like Udacity and Coursera. JetBrains offers its own project-based courses through JetBrains Academy, where learners can build tech skills using the same tools developers rely on every day.\n\nCourse catalog\n                                    \nAlready the online, often asynchronous, nature of such largely-attended courses poses a problem for helping students in a personalized way. We know that feedback is essential to the learning process, and that there are different types of feedback (see, for example, The Power of Feedback and this review specifically on automated feedback types). Courses with high matriculation numbers, whether on campus or online, often include automated assessments. Sometimes these courses additionally include smaller tutoring sessions, where feedback may be more personalized. Those students receiving both automated and personalized feedback are more likely to improve their learning than those receiving only automated feedback, as confirmed in, e.g., this 2024 paper.\nRecently, researchers have started developing automated ways to provide students with more personalized feedback, such as predefining rules or templates, using systems based on previous student submissions, or incorporating large language models (see this recent overview for more details). Here we focus on the landscape of a particular type of assistance for students learning programming online, next-step hint generation, and explore the approaches currently available.\nProviding hints to students in online learning\nNext-step hint generation is a powerful approach that provides students with targeted, incremental guidance to help them progress through their courses. So when stuck, they are presented with what specific, small step will help them proceed. Once that step is completed, and if they need another hint, another step will be given. For example, a student could be stuck on a programming task and cannot figure out why. To help, the hint could suggest something like the following:\n“Add a for loop that iterates over the indices of the ‘secret’ string.”\nHints can be generated as text like in the example above, (pseudo-)code, or a combination of both. Research has shown that only one type of feedback is not enough, and that students learn better when there are several levels like text and code. Instead of only pointing out errors or giving full solutions, they offer adaptive suggestions, include text explanations, and nudge learners toward the next logical step. Hints break down complex tasks into manageable pieces and encourage independent problem-solving, making them an essential tool for personalized learning support.\nWith the recent onset of large language models (LLMs), a few researchers have been exploring the possibilities of combining the open APIs of LLMs, such as gpt-3.5 and gpt-4, with personalized feedback generation. This type of approach comes with the benefit that researchers do not need a large amount of data on student submissions. So far there exist only a handful of these types of systems. Examples of a few tools can be found in the table below, including information about the hint type, where the tool can be used, and features; see this 2022 state-of-the-art review for more details.\n\nThe first two tools, CodeHelp and CodeAid, use gpt-3.5, while CS50.ai uses gpt-4. All tools in the table above only use the LLM directly; that is, there is no additional output processing. Without this processing, potential inaccuracies (such as hallucinations or ignored prompt instructions) can arise, thereby compromising the hint quality. The tools also require students to craft their own prompts, adding an extra challenge for students, especially beginners who are already known to struggle with seeking help.\nTo address such challenges, our research team developed a tool with the following features:\nPart of the course’s integrated development environment (IDE)\nBoth text and code hints\nProcessing of the LLM-generated code\nAI-based hints for in-IDE Learning\nOur researchers from the Education Research lab recently developed an AI-based tool for the open-source JetBrains Academy plugin. This research is a part of the PhD work of the lab’s head, Anastasiia Birillo, completed under the supervision of Dr. Hieke Keuning in the Software Technology for Learning and Teaching Group at Utrecht University. \nThe JetBrains Academy plugin is an extension for JetBrains IDEs, created specifically to support in-IDE learning. The plugin adapts the IDE window by adding a course structure panel, course progress bar, task description panel with theory, explanations, and non-coding types of assignments, and a check button for running tests predefined by the course author. There are already over 50 courses compatible with this format, and any third-party educator can add their own compatible course. \nCheck it out!\n                                    \nThe plugin provides different assignment types, and these tasks can be isolated or combined within a larger project. The types of tasks can be categorized as:\nTheoretical: concepts explained in a text or a video form with related quiz questions or coding tasks\nPractical: a quiz or a programming assignment\nWith the combination of the hint tool with the plugin, students learn programming languages by coding and simultaneously receiving personalized feedback, all within the IDE. If you are interested in what students and developers think about in-IDE learning, check out this recent paper where our researchers conducted interviews to learn about just that. \nHow our hint system works\nBefore getting into the technical features that set our AI-based hint tool apart from tools like the ones mentioned above, let’s look at how the tool works. Here are a few basic technical features:\nThe system uses gpt-4o for all LLM interactions.\nThe system generates both text and code hints.\nIt was originally designed for Kotlin and this version has been validated (see below). \nA Python version was developed later and is already available in the JetBrains Academy plugin.\nIn the example image below, a student is creating a program to simulate the game Hangman, where a user can try to guess a word by inputting letters. The current task requires the student to implement a complex function, generateNewUserWord. In the example, the student has already defined newUserWord and separator, but they don’t know how to implement the part of the function concerning already guessed letters. \n\n\n\n\nTo get help with the task, the student can request a hint by clicking the blue check button at the bottom (below the text hint). Clicking this button runs test cases, checks whether the code compiles, and displays the following two elements:\nThe text hint, on the bottom right side, marked with a pink rectangle\nThe highlighted position in the code, marked with a green rectangle\nThe highlighting feature is an important part of the design because (i) the hint system should be complex enough to help students with tasks longer than one function, and (ii) when there is a long file and the student is stuck anyway, it might not be obvious where to apply the hint. \nWithin the textual hint window, there is also a show in code link. As suggested by its name, it provides the student access to the code hint, which appears as a window with highlighted differences between the student’s code and the solution code. This can be seen in the following screenshot, where the code hint is marked in pink.\n\n\n\n\nOn the lower right side of the above image, rows 31–32 are highlighted in green. In this case, these rows represent what is missing from the student’s code, namely, the for loop which should iterate over the indices of the secret string, as stated in the text hint. \nFrom this code hint, the student can choose to accept the hint (found on the top of the above image), in which case the suggested changes are automatically applied, or cancel the hint and return to their own solution to manually modify it. This means the code hint provides bottom-out help, or the exact code needed to progress to the next step. As you can see in the example above, the code hint does not provide the content of the for loop, so the student has a chance to continue on their own.\nStudents may request a next-step hint at any time during the task, except when the task is already solved. The hints can help the students proceed with the task, or fix a test or compilation errors. There is currently no limitation on the number of hint requests in the plugin’s current version; JetBrains Academy is a MOOC platform where students voluntarily participate in courses, so it is ultimately up to them how they want to learn.\nNot only does the in-IDE course format provide students with a professional environment to build their coding skills, it is also a good environment for implementing a novel next-step hint system. For one, the programming assignments can be complex, and the IDE conveniently provides several crucial features, such as an API for static analysis and code quality analysis, the topic of the next subsection.\nCode hint quality improvement in the IDE\nOne might think that because the text hint is shown first to the students, the hint system must also internally generate the text hint before the code one. According to this 2024 paper, as well as our own internal validation reported in §5 of our paper, a hint system delivers much better results when it generates the code hint before the text hint.\nWith code as the main entity, we can apply cool IDE features to improve the code instead of just showing an unprocessed hint to the student. For the code processing, we used static analysis and code quality analysis. The figure below depicts the internal system pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of our approach is that we process the LLM-generated code using static analysis and code quality analysis, so that the code is examined without executing the program. Automated tools like those found in our JetBrains IDEs can scan a project’s code to check for vulnerabilities such as:\nProgramming errors\nCoding standard violations\nUndefined values\nSyntax violations\nOur AI-based hint system uses an LLM to generate code based on the student’s code and any error information. However, LLMs are inherently unreliable, having the well-known potential to produce hallucinations (see this 2024 paper and this other 2024 paper for recent research), and we wanted the hints provided to students to be the most accurate possible. The combination of in-IDE code processing and generating the code hint before the text hint enabled us to create a tool with high hint accuracy. \nThe code processing included ensuring code quality and controlling hint size, among other improvements (more details are available in the paper). The following list describes each in more detail: \nTo improve the quality of the generated code, we used the IDE’s code quality inspections for optimizing code and for correcting common security and style issues. We selected 30 Kotlin inspections for which automatic fixes are available. The following code blocks show an example:\nmonth >= && month <= 12\nThe comparison code from above gets transformed into a Kotlin range as below.\n1..12\nLLMs do not always comprehend that only one step needs to be generated, even within one function. We believe that a good hint provides one logical action, not multiple ones at a time. To control the hint size, we developed some heuristics (more details can be found in the paper’s supplementary material). The figure below shows an example with additive statement isolation.\n\n\n\n\nBy processing the LLM-generated code before the student sees the hint, we can greatly improve the hint’s quality. This quality control gives our hint system an advantage over previously developed tools.\nHint system evaluation by students\nIn addition to the quality control described in the previous subsection, we validated the quality of the systems with experts and got feedback from students who used the tool in a course. In this subsection, we will only talk about the student validation; the details of the expert validation can be found in §5 of our paper. \nAs described above, hints have been developed for many MOOCs but less so for in-IDE courses, meaning that the MOOC-hint format is well-studied, while the in-IDE-hint format is not. Considering this, plus the fact that the IDE setting is inherently complex, we were interested in finding out how best to show text hints.\nTo find out, we conducted a user experience study, containing 15-minute comparative usability interviews with nine students of varying degrees of experience in programming.  \nFrom the interviews, we learned that students prefer having:\nThe hint in the same context as the task, in contrast to the hint in the code window\nThe relevant position highlighted in the code\nOn top of how to best show text hints, we were interested in what they thought about the usefulness and ease of use of the provided hints, both by looking at usage data and by asking the students directly. The data comes from fourteen students who completed five to six projects in the in-IDE Kotlin Onboarding: Introduction course, available in the JetBrains Academy catalog. More specifically, we used the KOALA tool to collect in-IDE activity data from the students who agreed to participate, followed by a qualitative assessment with open-ended questions.\nOverall, we collected 64,512 code snippets; if you are interested in the dataset for research purposes, you can contact our team.  The data indicated that:\nStudents requested text hints 191 times. \nOf those 191 times, students requested to see a code hint about half the time (101). \nRequest distribution across the course’s projects varied: the first basic projects contained less hint-requesting data than the later projects. \nIn the qualitative survey, 14 students were asked why they requested a hint, and could give multiple answers. The figure below shows the four most popular reasons for choosing a hint.\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the figure above, the students reported using the hint system for its purpose, as well as for their own curiosity. There is additionally room for improvement with respect to compilation errors. \nWe also asked them further questions. Insights from their responses are summarized in the following:\nWhen asked what they did when the hint was unclear, 11 of the 14 students said they then tried to solve the task on their own, without searching online or asking an LLM. \nHalf of the students said they preferred to see a combination of both text and code hints, which aligns with what we saw in the TaskTracker data, where about half of the students requested both text and code hints.\nA key insight from the interviews was that the hint system is most helpful for beginner students. The hint tool is more helpful than searching online, because students at that level do not know what to search for or what prompt to use to ask an LLM. The flipside of this is that more advanced students prefer a chat-based interface, as in CS50.ai (see above), suggesting that a future version of our system would benefit from combining hints with a chat feature.  In general, the students gave positive feedback on our hints system, with many indicating that they would be interested in continuing to use it for future courses. \nWatch this space for a follow-up study, where we analyzed how another set of students used the hint tool. This work looks specifically at where any pain points might arise, and what can be done to improve students’ learning experience. \nIn the meantime, if you are interested in collaborating with our Education Research team, you can find more information on their website.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When we first set out to get smarter AI edits in Visual Studio Copilot, we knew we were tackling a deeply complex problem. It wasn’t just about generating great suggestions—it was about figuring out how to seamlessly apply those suggestions to your code. While the idea seemed simple at first glance, the reality was anything but.   \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/SideBySideNewMapper.mp4\n\nThe Complexity of Implementing AI-Generated Edits \nLet’s rewind to our early attempts. Copilot might give you a fantastic suggestion—a new method, a helpful refactor, or maybe even a corrected logic block. But the real challenge began when we tried to insert those changes into the existing file without breaking anything. Where does the edit go? What happens if the file has been updated since the suggestion was generated? What if the model’s output inadvertently introduces conflicts, overlaps existing code, or even forgets a required bracket? These questions made the process tricky, and the resulting red squiggles made it difficult to trust AI suggestions. \nIn the early days, we approached this problem in the most straightforward way possible: brute force. We used heuristics and rule-based techniques like string matching and pattern recognition to identify where edits might belong. It worked… kind of. The results were often inconsistent, especially for complex edits spanning multiple lines. And as Copilot’s capabilities expanded to support more languages and scenarios, maintaining these rules became a moving target—always shifting, always growing harder to manage. Success rates hovered around 50%, which was far from ideal. In hindsight, it became increasingly clear that we couldn’t outpace the ever-evolving models with static rules.   \nBetter Models Meet Smarter Techniques \nAs AI technology advanced, we saw an opportunity to revisit this problem with a fresh perspective. Two major developments in AI made it possible to rethink how we could get smarter edits in Visual Studio Copilot: modern models with larger context windows and a groundbreaking technique called speculative decoding.   \nSpeculative decoding became a game changer for speeding up AI-assisted edits. It works by pairing a fast model with a more sophisticated one. The fast model generates token predictions for the edit ahead of time, while the smarter model steps in only when needed to refine or verify those predictions. This collaboration improved average token generation speed by 2-3x and made it feasible to implement the generated edits using the model, which significantly enhanced accuracy when integrating changes into your files.   \nBy using speculative decoding, we adopted the model-based approach to applying edits that was able to fill in the gaps that the previous approach could not reach. Instead of relying on rule sets, we employed an AI model to simulate an “ideal” version of your file with the chosen suggestions seamlessly integrated. A smart diff algorithm then compares this ideal version with your actual file to pinpoint and precisely map the edits. This allowed the entire process to handle edge cases—like overlapping code or missing syntax—more intelligently than ever before.      \nBalancing Accuracy and Speed \nWhile speculative decoding dramatically improved performance, applying AI edits still came with a natural trade-off: using models introduced latency. Previously, all string computation was done locally, meaning edits appeared almost instantly. Now, every edit involved network calls and token generation—a process that unfolds incrementally as a token stream, rather than as a single, instant response.   \nTo make this experience feel meaningful for users, we implemented a streaming animation in the editor. As edits are detected on the token stream, users see their document updating line by line in real time. This animation serves two purposes: showcasing progress and providing visibility into exactly how the changes are being applied. Although this approach trades the speed we had before for greater accuracy, feedback has shown that users value precision over raw speed—especially when it comes to maintaining code quality and reducing disruption.      \nLooking Ahead\nThis work laid the foundation for Agent Mode in Visual Studio Copilot—a feature that enables the AI to not only suggest improvements but actively assist in executing them. For Agent Mode to function effectively, the edits needed to be precise, seamless, and reliable enough for the agent to build, debug, and test the code. Speculative decoding has already made significant strides in balancing speed and accuracy, but we’re not stopping there.\nA faster implementation of our speculative decoding technique is on the horizon. This updated version will leverage advancements in token generation and model pairing to further reduce latency while maintaining accuracy users have come to expect. Early tests show promise of a 2-4x speed boost compared to the original rollout, moving closer to the ideal experience where precision meets near-instant response times. \nThe post Smarter AI Edits in Visual Studio Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">《매일 아침 써봤니》</span>였어요. 책 전체를 요약하려는 부담은 내려놓고, 제가 정말 인상 깊게 읽은 문장들만 따로 모았죠. 종이책이라면 포스트잇이나 밑줄, 사진 찍기를 활용해도 좋고, 전자책은 밀리의 서재나 리디북스의 메모 기능으로 하이라이트를 정리할 수 있어서 편해요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이렇게 모은 문장들을 가지고 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 말했어요. \"제가 밑줄 친 문장을 각 장별로 3가지 핵심 포인트로 요약해 주세요.\" 챕터별로 깔끔하게 정리된 요약을 받아보니, 그 안에서 실천 아이디어로 확장할 수 있을 만한 포인트들이 하나둘씩 눈에 들어오기 시작했습니다. 진짜 신기하더라고요!</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 24px;

ChatGPT를 활용해 나만의 자기계발 워크북을 만드는 구체적인 방법을 소개합니다. 더 이상 책장에 꽂아두지만 말고, 내 삶의 변화를 위한 첫걸음을 시작해보세요.\n\n\n \n자기계발서, 좋아하시나요? 저도 참 좋아하는데요, 좋은 문장을 발견하면 밑줄을 긋고, 메모하고, 혼자 감탄까지 하죠. 근데 이상하게도, 그렇게 열심히 읽은 책들이 제 삶을 진짜로 바꿔줬던 적은 별로 없었던 것 같아요. 오히려 시간이 지나면 어떤 책을 읽었는지 가물가물해질 때가 더 많더라고요.  \n그러던 어느 날, 우연히 유튜브에서 \"책은 읽는 게 아니라 써야 내 것이 된다. 워크북을 만들어 보세요\"라는 한 크리에이터의 말을 듣게 됐습니다. 이 한마디가 머릿속을 쾅! 하고 울렸달까요? 그래서 저는 그날부터 책 속 문장들을 바탕으로 나만의 실천 워크북을 ChatGPT와 함께 만들기 시작했어요.\n1. 책의 핵심 문장을 정리하기  \n가장 먼저 시작한 책은 김민식 PD님의 베스트셀러, 《매일 아침 써봤니》였어요. 책 전체를 요약하려는 부담은 내려놓고, 제가 정말 인상 깊게 읽은 문장들만 따로 모았죠. 종이책이라면 포스트잇이나 밑줄, 사진 찍기를 활용해도 좋고, 전자책은 밀리의 서재나 리디북스의 메모 기능으로 하이라이트를 정리할 수 있어서 편해요.\n이렇게 모은 문장들을 가지고 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 말했어요. \"제가 밑줄 친 문장을 각 장별로 3가지 핵심 포인트로 요약해 주세요.\" 챕터별로 깔끔하게 정리된 요약을 받아보니, 그 안에서 실천 아이디어로 확장할 수 있을 만한 포인트들이 하나둘씩 눈에 들어오기 시작했습니다. 진짜 신기하더라고요!\n2. 감명 깊은 문장에서 실천 아이디어 뽑아내기  \n책을 읽으며 가장 마음에 남았던 문장은 바로 \"글을 쓰는 사람은 매일 자신을 편집해 나가는 사람이다.\"였어요. 이 문장을 보는 순간, '나도 매일 나를 조금씩 편집할 수 있을까?' 하는 생각이 들었죠. 그래서 바로 ChatGPT에게 이렇게 물어봤습니다.\n  ChatGPT 프롬프트 예시\n\"이 문장(‘글을 쓰는 사람은 매일 자신을 편집해 나가는 사람이다’)을 바탕으로 제가 일상에서 실천할 수 있는 3가지 방법을 알려주세요.\"\n그 결과 나온 제안들은 정말 현실적이었어요. 예를 들어, '하루 한 문장으로 나를 돌아보는 글 써보기', 'SNS 대신 5분간 일기 쓰기', '하루를 마무리하며 \"오늘 내가 가장 자랑스러운 선택은?\"이라고 스스로에게 질문하기' 같은 아이디어였죠. 이렇게 얻은 아이디어들을 바탕으로 자연스럽게 워크북에 넣을 질문과 과제들이 만들어지기 시작했습니다.\n3. 연습 문제는 다양하게 구성하기 ✨\n꾸준히 실천하려면 한 가지 형식보다는 여러 형식의 연습 문제를 섞는 게 좋아요. 제가 주로 사용한 대표적인 형식들을 표로 정리해봤습니다.\n문제 형식\n예시\n\n\n\n\n반성 질문 (Reflection)\n\"나는 어떤 글을 쓸 때 가장 내 마음에 솔직한가요?\"\n\n\n미니 프로젝트 (Mini Project)\n\"하루 5분, ‘감정 일기’ 실험해보기\"\n\n\n습관 추적기 (Habit Tracker)\n\"일주일간 글쓰기 습관 체크리스트 만들어보기\"\n\n\n시각화 질문 (Visualization)\n\"3개월 동안 매일 글을 쓴 나의 모습을 상상해보세요.\"\n\n\n\n이런 질문들은 단순한 ‘독서’를 넘어, 나 자신과 마주보게 하는 대화의 도구가 되어줍니다. 책의 내용을 내 삶으로 끌어당기는 힘이 생기는 거죠.  \n4. 한 챕터만 골라도 충분합니다  \n처음부터 책 전체를 다 워크북으로 만들려고 하면 정말 부담스럽잖아요. 그래서 저는 한 챕터씩, 딱 하나의 문장만 골라 연습 문제를 만들기 시작했습니다. 예를 들어 《매일 아침 써봤니》 중 ‘아침 루틴과 글쓰기’에 대한 챕터를 골라 이렇게 구성해봤어요.\n  실천 워크북 챕터 구성 예시\n핵심 아이디어: 아침은 하루 중 가장 순수한 시간이다.\n반성하기: 나는 아침을 어떻게 보내고 있는가?\n실천하기: 내일 아침 10분만 '마음 흘려쓰기' 실험하기\n기록하기: 7일간 아침 글쓰기 실천 결과 기록지 만들기\n이런 식으로 핵심 → 시도 → 반성 → 추적의 흐름을 따라가면 어떤 책이든 워크북 형식으로 재구성할 수 있습니다. 한 챕터만 완벽하게 내 것으로 만들어도 충분한 성과가 되잖아요.\n5. 나만의 워크북 만들기 (Google Docs 활용)  \n완성된 질문과 과제들은 Google Docs에 정리했어요. 노션(Notion)이나 티스토리 비공개 글 등 편한 도구를 활용하면 됩니다. 제 워크북의 구성은 대략 이랬어요.\n표지: 책 제목과 '나만의 성장 노트'\n시작 노트: 왜 이 책을 선택했고, 무엇을 실천하고 싶은지\n챕터별 연습 문제: 질문 + 실천 + 추적 템플릿\n중간 점검 페이지: \"지금까지 잘한 점은?\", \"아직 어려운 점은?\"\n마무리 편지: \"이 책을 읽고, 나는 이렇게 변했다.\", \"앞으로 무엇을 지속하고 싶은가?\"\nChatGPT에게 \"이 내용을 예쁘게 정리된 워크북 형식으로 만들어주세요 (Google Docs용)\"이라고 요청하면 서식 구성도 도와주니 참고해 보세요!\n \n마무리하며: 책은 곧 도구입니다  ️\n예전엔 책을 다 읽으면 배움도 끝났다고 생각했어요. 하지만 지금은 책을 다 읽은 순간이 진짜 실천의 시작점이 된다는 걸 깨달았죠. 책장에 꽂힌 책이 아니라, 손에 들고 직접 '쓰는' 책이 되어야 하니까요.\n하이라이트 한 줄, 인상적인 문장 하나면 충분합니다. 그걸 ChatGPT에게 보여주고, 질문을 던져보세요. 그 작은 문장이 여러분의 삶에 생각지 못한 작은 변화를 일으킬 수 있습니다. 책이 책장에 꽂혀 있기만 한다면, 너무 아깝지 않을까요? 지금 한 챕터만 골라서, 워크북으로 꺼내보세요. 저처럼 분명히 새로운 ‘무언가’가 시작될 거예요.  \n \n \nChatGPT와 함께 워크북 만들기\n✨ 핵심 문장 정리: 책 전체가 아닌, 인상 깊은 문장만 추려보세요!\n  실천 아이디어 확장: \"내가 일상에서 실천할 수 있는 방법\"을 ChatGPT에게 물어보세요.\n  다양한 문제 구성:\n반성 질문, 미니 프로젝트, 습관 추적기, 시각화 질문 등\n  부담 없이 시작: 한 챕터씩만 골라 연습 문제를 만들어봐도 충분해요!\n책을 '읽기'에서 '쓰기'로 바꿔 당신의 성장을 편집하세요.\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 워크북을 만드는 데 꼭 ChatGPT를 써야 하나요?\nA: 꼭 필요한 건 아니지만, ChatGPT는 실천 아이디어를 구체화하고 다양한 연습 문제를 만드는 데 큰 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 혼자 고민하는 시간을 줄이고, 아이디어를 빠르게 확장하는 좋은 도구죠.\nQ: 워크북을 만들 책은 어떻게 고르는 게 좋을까요?\nA: 가장 좋아하는 책, 혹은 최근에 읽으면서 '이거다!' 하고 감명 깊었던 문장이 있는 책으로 시작해 보세요. 처음부터 부담 없이 시작하는 것이 가장 중요합니다.\nQ: 책 전체를 다 다뤄야 한다는 부담이 있어요.\nA: 굳이 책 전체를 다 다룰 필요는 없습니다. 글에서 제안한 것처럼, 가장 인상 깊은 한 챕터나 문장만 골라 워크북을 만들어도 충분한 효과를 볼 수 있어요. 작게 시작해 보세요!\n\n\n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워크북을 만드는 데 꼭 ChatGPT를 써야 하나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  꼭 필요한 건 아니지만, ChatGPT는 실천 아이디어를 구체화하고 다양한 연습 문제를 만드는 데 큰 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 혼자 고민하는 시간을 줄이고, 아이디어를 빠르게 확장하는 좋은 도구죠.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워크북을 만들 책은 어떻게 고르는 게 좋을까요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  가장 좋아하는 책, 혹은 최근에 읽으면서 '이거다!' 하고 감명 깊었던 문장이 있는 책으로 시작해 보세요. 처음부터 부담 없이 시작하는 것이 가장 중요합니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"책 전체를 다 다뤄야 한다는 부담이 있어요.\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  굳이 책 전체를 다 다룰 필요는 없습니다. 글에서 제안한 것처럼, 가장 인상 깊은 한 챕터나 문장만 골라 워크북을 만들어도 충분한 효과를 볼 수 있어요. 작게 시작해 보세요!\"\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }",

VMD Controller를 활성화하기 전에 Windows에 드라이버를 설치해줘야 한다.\n그런데 VMD Controller를 활성화하기 전에 intel RST드라이버를 설치하려고 해도 하드웨어적으로 VMD 장치가 확인되지 않기 때문에(활성화되어있지 않기 때문에) Windows에서 드라이버 설치가 안된다.\n부분적으로 2개 슬롯만 VMD 모드로 돌릴 수 있으면 좋겠다고 생각했는데 찾아보니 메인보드에 기능이 있다. OS설치된 SSD는 제외시키고 다른 2개의 SSD만 VMD Controller제어로 두고 부팅하면 부팅도 정상적으로 되고 RST드라이버도 설치 가능하다. 물론 2개의 SSD는 당장은 잡히지 않는다.

AI 투자 덕분에 외형적으론 글로벌 벤처 투자는 2024년 Q3($57B)부터 2025년 Q1($121B) 까지 연속 3사분기 상승 중이다. 실은 벤처투자가 증가하고 있다는 건 VC들에게 자금을 제공하는 LP들도 더 활발하게 투자하고 있다는 간접적인 증거이기 때문에 여러모로 좋은 시그널이다. 하지만, 너무 많은 돈이 극소수의 AI 회사에 투입되고 있다는 건 – 예를 들면, 2025년 Q1 전체 글로벌 벤처 투자금 $121B 중 거의 3분의 1인 $40B이 OpenAI 단 한 개의 회사에 투입됐다 – 아직도 뭔가 불안하고 찜찜하지만, 어쨌든 부정적인 것보단 긍정적인 신호라고 생각한다.\n한국도 여기저기서 긍정적인 소식이 들려온다. 새로운 정부가 AI에 100조 원을 투자하겠다고 발표했고, 벤처 투자 생태계에도 40조 원가량의 자금을 투입하겠다고 했다. 솔직히 말해서 이 돈을 어디서 어떻게 조달할진 잘 모르겠지만, 긍정적인 소식이며, 하반기에는 유동성이 조금씩 풀리지 않을까 기대한다. 정부가 벤처 투자를 리딩하는 건 장기적으론 부정적인 면도 많지만, 반면에 현재와 같은 위기 상황에서는 정부가 이렇게 시원하게 쏘는 것만큼 단기적으론 좋은 방법도 없다고 생각한다.\n이런 시그널이 보이는 분위기에서 요새 나는 우리 창업가분들에게 다음과 같은 조언을 하고 있다.\n첫째, 2022년 후반부터 성장보단 생존과 수익성에 집중하고 있는 회사 중, 아직도 비용을 못 줄여서 매달 마이너스가 나고, 명확하게 공식화할 수 없는 PMF와 비즈니스 모델을 못 찾은 분들에겐 계속하던 대로 성장보단 생존에 집중하라고 한다. 이런 회사들은 아직도 한 달 벌어 한 달 먹고사는 곳들이 많아서 계속 비용 절감과 비즈니스 모델 확립에 집중해야 한다. 운전에 비유하자면, 고속도로보단 계속 국도로 달리는 것이다. 국도에서 가속하지 말고, 정속 주행을 통해서 기름을 아끼는 전략이다. 하지만, 조금씩 천천히 앞으로 가곤 있다.\n둘째, 2022년 후반부터 성장보단 생존과 수익성에 집중하면서 지난 3년 동안 비용 절감에 성공해서 흑자 전환을 했고, 어떻게 하면 확실하게 돈을 벌 수 있는지 공식화할 수 있는 비즈니스 모델과 PMF를 찾았다면, 이제 다시 서서히 성장에 대해 고민해 보라고 한다. 운전에 비유하자면, 이제 국도를 서서히 벗어나면서 다시 고속도로에 진입해서 악셀러레이터를 힘차게 밟아보는 것이다. 하지만, 그렇다고 대책 없이 돈을 써서 마이너스를 내면서 성장하라는 조언은 아니다. 지금까지 만들어 놓은 좋은 비즈니스 모델을 돈을 버는 프레임 안에서 더 가속하라는 조언이다.\n이렇게 국도에서 다시 고속도로로 진입하려면 돈도 더 필요하고, 어쩌면 사람도 더 필요한데, 이보다 더 중요한 건, 창업가의 마인드와 태도의 180도 변화이다. 너무 오랫동안 국도만 달렸기 때문에 다시 고속도로로 진입해서 그동안 시속 50km를 넘지 않았던 악셀러레이터를 더 밟아서 80km 이상으로 달려야 하는데, 다시 성장 모드로 마인드를 바꾸는 게 쉽지 않다. 회사의 전략과 방향을 180도 다르게 설정하는 데에도 switching cost가 발생하지만, 실은 가장 극복하기 어려운 건 창업가의 두려움이다. 이미 지난 3년 동안 돈이 없으면 얼마나 사업이 힘들어지는지 뼈저리게 경험하고 배웠기 때문에 다시 성장에 집중하는 게 너무 공포스러울 수도 있을 것이다. 성장에 집중하려면, 펀드레이징도 다시 해야 하고, 더 많은 돈을 써야 하는데, 혹시라도 이렇게 하는 과정에서 돈을 다 써서 다시 힘든 시점이 오면, 그땐 다시 한번 어려움을 극복할 수 있는 체력과 정신력이 남아 있을지,,,그 생각만 해도 공황장애가 오기 때문이다.\n아직 제대로 된 비즈니스 모델을 못 찾았다면, 계속 비용 절감하면서 생존에 집중해라. 이런 사업이면 어차피 고속도로에 진입해도 속력도 못 내고 금세 연료가 떨어져서 멈출 것이다. 하지만, 이제 돈을 확실하게 벌 수 있는 사업을 만들었다면 위에서 말한 두려움을 떨쳐내고 과감하게 고속도로에 진입해라. 그리고 다시 쌩쌩 달릴 수 있는 방법을 찾아야 한다. 어차피 스타트업이란 어느 시점엔 성장을 해야 하는데, 이미 3년이라는 시간을 까먹었기 때문에 따라잡아야 하는 거리가 상당히 많이 남았을 것이다. 다시 한번 용기를 내어보자.",

만난다. 소규모 친목 모임을 생각하지 마시라. 조선 후기에는 계의 규모에 따라 이름도 달리 붙였는데, 100명이 모이면 ‘작백계’, 1,000명이면 ‘천인계’, 10,000명이면 ‘만인계’라고 불렀다. 계원들에게 일정액의 곗돈을 걷은 후 정해진 날 추첨을 통해 당첨자를 뽑아 모인 돈의 약 80%를 복채금(당첨금)으로 지급하는 형태였다. \n그 중에서도 만인계 인기가 높았다. 추첨일이 되면 마을 공터나 산비탈에 사람들이 구름처럼 몰려들었고, 둥그런 나무통에 추첨 번호를 넣어 돌리는 방식으로 당첨자를 뽑았다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}당첨금의 일정 금액은 지방 관청에 납부했고, 관청은 이 돈을 도로나 다리 같은 지역 인프라를 만드는 데 사용했다.\n만인계와 관련된 흥미로운 이야기가 있다. 이토 히로부미를 저격한 독립운동가, 안중근 의사가 청년 시절 만인계의 사장을 맡았던 것이다. 20대 초반, 괄괄하고 리더십 강한 성격의 안중근은 우연한 계기로 만인계의 돈을 관리하고 추첨하는 채표 회사 사장이 되었다. 추첨이 있던 날 수만명이 모였는데 당첨자를 뽑는 통에 문제가 생겼다. 번호표가 한 장만 나와야 하는데 여러 장이 쏟아져 나온 것이다. 군중은 흥분했고 ‘사기다!’라며 소리를 지르거나 주먹을 휘둘렀다. 이 찰나에 안중근은 총을 꺼내며 외쳤다..css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;} “내가 쏟은 게 아니고, 이 통이 쏟아진 것을 왜 나를 죽이네 살리네 한단 말이오!” 20대의 안중근 의사는 가까스로 상황을 모면할 수 있었다고 한다.\n만인계는 많은 사람들의 참여를 통해 자금을 모았고, 그 중 일부를 공공에 환원한다는 점에서 오늘날 복권 제도와 유사하다.\n해방 이후: 복권이 나라를 살릴 수도 있을까?\n1945년 해방 이후 대한민국은 극심한 혼란을 겪었다. 35년간의 식민지 생활 후 200만 명이 넘는 재외 동포의 귀환, 그리고 6.25 전쟁의 발발. 나라는 지독히 가난했다. 정부는 구호 기금 마련을 목적으로 복권을 발행하였다. 1949년 10월부터 1960년 6월까지 세 차례에 걸쳐 ‘후생 복표’라는 이름의 복권을 발행해 복권 1매당 200원씩 판매했고, 당첨금은 100만 원이었는데 지금의 수억 원에 달하는 큰 금액이었다. 이후에도 전후 사업 부흥 자금을 모으기 위해 ‘애국 복권’을 발행했다. 이 시기의 복권은 국가 재건을 위한 절박한 선택지였다.\n복권과 관련하여 애틋한 사연도 있다. 1948년은 제14회 런던올림픽이 개최되는 해. 우리나라는 선수단의 식비나 교통비조차 마련하기 어려운 형편이었다. 이러한 상황 가운데 독립운동가 출신의 전경무를 중심으로 ‘대한올림픽위원회’*는 ‘올림픽 후원권’이라는 복권을 발행한다. 1등 100만 원, 2등 50만 원, 3등 10만 원의 당첨금을 걸었던 복권은 성공적으로 판매되었고, 그 결과 약 8만 달러의 자금을 모을 수 있었다. 덕분에 대한민국 선수단은 런던 올림픽 무대에 설 수 있었다. 독립국가 대한민국은 처음으로 올림픽이라는 국제 스포츠 무대를 경험 할 수 있었고 놀랍게도 권투와 역도에서 동메달 2개를 획득했다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*1946년 창설된 뒤 올림픽과 아시안게임에 국가대표를 파견하는 역할을 해왔고, 2009년에는 대한체육회로 통합되었다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n제14회 런던올림픽 후원권. 복권에 대한올림픽 부위원장이었던 전경무의 얼굴이 새겨져 있다. 독립운동가 출신으로 임시정부를 도왔던 전경무는 해방 후 체육 부흥을 위해 동분서주했고 직접 IOC에 대한민국의 참가를 신청하러 가던 중 비행기 추락사고로 목숨을 잃었다. / 출처: 국가유산청 \n중세 유럽에서도 복권은 국가 재정의 숨은 도구였다. 16세기 중반 영국의 엘리자베스 1세는 스페인과의 전쟁에서 승리하기 위해 함정을 건조하고 항구를 정비할 목적으로 복권을 발행했다. 프랑스도 마찬가지였다. 절대 군주 루이 14세의 사치와 전쟁으로 바닥나버린 국고를 메우기 위해 루이 15세는 복권을 도입했는데 이를 통해 200만 프랑의 매출을 올렸고 그중 1/4을 파리의 공공사업에 투자했다.\n이처럼 복권은 국가 재정 정책에 있어 부수적이지만 쏠쏠한 수단이 되었고 복지와 공공 기반 확충에 기여할 수 있었다. 이런 이유 때문에 국가는 복권 발행에 따른 사행성 문제에도 불구하고 다양한 방식의 복권 사업을 직접 주도하거나 독점적으로 관리해 온 것이다.\n70년대: 준비하시고- 쏘세요\n1969년 9월 15일 첫 발행된 ‘주택복권’은 우리나라에서 처음으로 정기 발행된 복권이었다. 과거 복권이 ‘후생 복표’, ‘애국 복권’ 등 특정한 목적에 따라 한시적으로 운영되었던 것과 달리 주택복권은 월 1회, 주 1회 식으로 정기적으로 운영되어 국민 곁으로 적극 다가왔다.\n1970년대 들어 산업화가 본격적으로 진행되는 가운데, 많은 국민들이 ‘내 집 마련’이라는 기대가 부풀어 올랐고 이에 부응하면서 주택복권이 등장했다. 당시 주택복권은 한국주택은행이 발행했는데 저소득층 주거 안정 사업 지원을 표방하며 1969년 9월 15일 복권 1매당 100원씩, 발행 총액 5천만 원, 1등 당첨금을 3백만 원으로 판매를 시작했다.\n\n매일경제신문에 게재된 제1회 주택복권 발매 광고 / 출처: 매일경제\n주택복권 추첨 장면은 TV로 생중계되었는데 흑백TV가 보급되면서 시작된 진기한 풍경이었다. 당첨자 선정은 숫자가 적힌 원반을 돌린 뒤 화살을 쏘아 당첨 번호를 정하는 방식이었다. “준비하시고- 쏘세요!” 라는 아나운서의 멘트는 당시 최고의 유행어가 되기도 했다. 복권 추첨이 단순한 이벤트를 넘어 하나의 대중문화 콘텐츠가 된 것이다.\n주택복권은 빠르게 대중의 일상으로 스며들었다. 초기에는 월 1회 발행되었지만, 점차 발행주기가 늘어나 1972년에는 주 1회로 확대되었고, 당첨금은 하루가 빠르게 높아졌다. 1969년 1등 당첨금은 300만 원.  6년 후인 1975년 8월 경에는 900만 원, 1984년 중반에는 1억 원으로 당첨금은 수직 상승하게 된다. 그만큼 한국의 경제 성장과 물가 상승, 무엇보다 집값의 오름세가 가팔랐다.\n당시 신문에는 ‘주택 복권 인기 시들’, ‘당첨 금액 파격적으로 높여’ 같은 문구가 자주 등장한다. 정부는 복권을 통해 건설·교통 분야의 자금을 조달하고자 했고, 당첨금을 인상함으로써 국민의 관심을 유지하려 했다. 대중적인 인기를 끌었던 주택복권은, 1983년 올림픽복권이 발행되면서 잠정 중단될 때까지 총 574회 발행되었고, 약 1,016억 원 규모가 판매되었다. 이를 통해 수해주택, 원호주택, 국가유공자 주택, 임대주택, 영세민주택 건설 등 약 4만 5천 호를 지원했다.\n90년대: 기다림은 가고 긁는 시대가 왔다\n1990년대 주택복권의 인기가 점차 시들해져 가던 무렵, 정부는 새로운 형태의 복권을 선보인다. 1990년 9월 1일, ‘엑스포 복권’이 등장한 것이다. 당시 정부는 1993년 대전세계박람회를 준비하고 있었는데 88서울올림픽 이후 처음으로 열리는 대규모 국제행사였다. 정부는 국민의 관심과 참여를 높이기 위해 ‘즉석 복권’이라는 아이디어를 꺼내 든다. 복권을 사고 일주일이나 기다릴 필요 없이 복권을 긁자마자 당첨 결과를 확인할 수 있는 새로운 방식이었다.\n최초의 즉석 복권인 엑스포 복권은 1990년부터 1993년까지 무려 3억 1,000장이 발행되었고, 총 415억 원의 판매 수익을 기록했다. 엑스포 복권이 성공하자, 여러 종류의 즉석 복권이 등장했는데 한 장을 사면 최대 6번이나 추첨할 수 있는 ‘또또복권’ 같은 새로운 컨셉의 복권도 이 시기에 등장한다.\n1998년 대한민국은 외환위기라는 초유의 사태를 겪어야만 했고, 복권 시장 역시 그 여파에서 자유롭지 못했다. 이 시기 정부 부처와 지자체는 복권 사업에 적극적이었다. 국토교통부의 주택복권, 과학기술정보통신부의 기술복권, 보건복지부의 엔젤복권 심지어 제주도의 관광복권 등 무려 21개의 부처나 지자체가 복권 사업에 참여한 것이다. 하지만 복권 사업 특혜 시비, 복권 기금 집행 문제 등 각종 문제가 발생며 복권에 대한 국민적 신뢰도는 추락하고 만다.\n2000년대: 407억 원 당첨자의 등장과 로또 열풍\n이러한 문제를 해결하고자 정부는 2002년 정부의 복권사업을 통합하고, 복권 기금의 엄정한 운영을 위한 복권위원회를 출범시켰다. 그 결과 ‘로또’가 등장하며 복권은 새로운 시대를 맞이한다. ‘인생 역전’을 내세우며 2002년 12월 등장한 ‘로또’는 그야말로 열풍을 일으켰다. 이전 복권과 달리 최고 당첨금액의 제한이 없다는 점 때문이었다. 로또가 발행된 지 몇 달 안 된 2003년 4월 제19회차의 1등 당첨자가 407억 원의 당첨금을 받게 되면서 당시 전국은 로또 열풍에 몸살을 앓았다. 수백, 수천만원의 돈을 들여서 복권 구매에 재산을 탕진하는 사람들까지 있었다.\n복권위원회의 조사*에 따르면, 성인 중  24.4%는 한 달에 한 번 로또복권을 구매한다고 한다. 로또를 살 때 50.5%는 5천 원 이하를, 34.3%는 5천 원에서 1만 원 사이를 지출해, 대체로 소액을 구매하는 편이다.\n*전국 만19세 이상 성인남녀 1,020명을 대상으로 2024년 실시\n로또복권의 판매액 역시 지난 10년간 꾸준히 상승해 왔다. 2013년 2조 9,896억 원이었던 판매액은 이후 매년 우상향 곡선을 그리며 늘어나, 2021년에는 5조 원을 돌파했고 2024년 상반기 기준으로는 5조 6,562억 원에 이르렀다. 판매액과 조사 결과를 보면, 로또 구매가 고정 소비 행위가 되었다는 사실을 확인할 수 있다.\n\n복권을 사는 마음은 사람마다 다를 것이다. 누군가는 일확천금을 바라고, 누군가는 그저 단순히 재미를 즐긴다. 하지만 개인의 기대와는 별개로, 복권은 오랫동안 국가 운영의 일부로 기능해 온 매우 정교한 시스템이다. 복권 수익금은 당첨자의 몫으로 모두 돌아가지 않는다. 우리가 복권 1,000원 어치를 사면, 그 중 410원이 복권기금으로 조성된다.  복권기금의 35%는 과학기술진흥기금, 중소기업창업 및 진흥기금 등 10개 법정배분기관에 법적으로 배분되며, 나머지 65%는 저소득층 임대주택 건설, 장애인·불우청소년 등 소외계층 지원 사업에 쓰이고 있다.\n복권의 사행성에 대한 비판이 고조될 때마다 복권의 공익적인 기능이 강조되지만, 더 섬세하게 들여다볼 필요가 있다. 복권 당첨 열풍과 그로 인한 중독과 상실감 등 사회적 후유증이 결코 적지 않기 때문이다.\n복권은 우연의 미학이다. ‘어쩌면’이라는 희박한 가능성을 사고파는 구조이고, 국가는 바로 이러한 ‘운’을 이용해 손쉽게 재정을 거둬들인다. 복권은 때로는 설레는 기대이지만, 지나치면 착각이 되고 중독이 되고 삶을 파멸로 몰고갈 수도 있다. 한 장의 복권은 가벼워야 한다. 복권에 인생을, 혹은 재정을 걸기 시작할 때부터 국민이건 정부 건 건강한 균형점을 잃어버리기 때문이다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호 윤자영",
