        "content:encodedSnippet": "C++ development often involves nuances beyond the file you’re developing in. This can leave developers with many mental tabs open, balancing all the relevant context for their project to develop their C++ code properly.\nCopilot Chat in Visual Studio can already utilize context provided by specified files and invoked agents such as @workspace to generate suggestions. However, to improve the relevance of Copilot suggestions, we must provide tailored context to Copilot with considerations specific to the C++ language for developers to achieve better results. That way, developers can focus less on providing all the information necessary for their questions and focus more on the task at hand.\nVisual Studio can now provide Copilot Chat with various levels of C++ project context. These updates are designed to help C++ developers incorporate more relevant suggestions into their code, faster than ever.\nTo showcase Copilot’s increased awareness of C++, we will walk through 3 sample C++ workflows where Chat can provide assistance:\nImproving documentation for build instructions\nGenerating new tests\nModernizing C++ code\nUpgrade to the latest version of Visual Studio 2022 and try out GitHub Copilot (now with plans available for free) to access these updates for C++.\nDocumenting Build Instructions\nC++ projects can sometimes require developers to undergo several steps to be able to configure a project for development before they are even able to begin coding. Due to these requirements, it is important to document relevant instructions for onboarding developers thoroughly.\nWe asked Copilot Chat to improve documentation in the open-source project Endless Sky’s README. Copilot was able to include relevant context, such as dependencies like Ninja, to enhance Chat suggestions for improving documentation specific to this project’s needs, minimizing manual toil to onboard developers onto a project.\n\nGenerating Additional Tests\nWriting unit tests for C++ can be cumbersome and painstaking. With the /tests command, Copilot can assist with generating unit tests for the selected code. Copilot now has awareness of the available testing structure found in your project, so that when you invoke /tests to generate tests in your projects, friction is minimal for integrating the generated tests that fit in with your existing ones.\nFor example, when we prompted to generate new unit tests for the Step method in the Weather.cpp file in endless-sky using the /tests command, Copilot generated new tests that resemble the existing tests in the project:\n\nWhen compared to existing test code, like test_ship.cpp, the Chat response includes the same relevant header files and test case structure like using SCENARIO and GIVEN for test cases.\n\nRefactoring C++ code for modernization\nMaintainability of C++ code can be difficult as C++ coding conventions evolve over the years. C++ developers often need to refactor legacy code to improve code clarity and maintainability over time.\nNow, when asking Copilot questions related to C++ development such as refactoring code,  Copilot has the awareness to not only provide suggestions that are relevant to your selected code, but also suggestions that are compliant with your project’s configurations and standards.\nLet’s take a look at an example, using some loop code that finds the greatest even element in a given container below. It can be useful to update C++ raw loop code to utilize algorithms instead for a myriad of reasons, including improving code readability and minimizing errors\n\nWhen initially asked to refactor the code to incorporate algorithms or ranges using older C++/CMake versions, Copilot suggests using std::max_element to improve the code to be more concise instead of requiring a manual loop.\n\nAfter updating the standard of the project to the latest standard of C++23, Copilot responses now include newer C++ features that can be relevant to the question, such as std::ranges, to improve the code.\n\nWhat do you think?\nTry out the latest Chat improvements for your C++ workflows today. To access these updates to Copilot, you’ll need an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the latest version of Visual Studio.\nIn addition, our team is working hard on improving C++ integrations with Copilot, so please let us know any other enhancements you’d like to see to your C++ workflows and content you’d like to see. Comment below, or you can find us via email at visualcpp@microsoft.com or via X at @VisualC.\n \n \n \nThe post Document build instructions and more with enhanced C++ awareness from Copilot Chat in Visual Studio appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

If you have any questions or want to share ideas around JetBrains products, most notably PyCharm, say hi at william.vincent@jetbrains.com.\nBackground\nI’m a former Django Board Member and the author of three books on Django. Since 2019, I’ve co-hosted the Django Chat podcast and co-written the weekly Django News newsletter while also maintaining several open-source projects, including the awesome-django and Lithium starter project repos. These days most of my new content is found on LearnDjango.com, which has a growing list of free tutorials and premium courses.\nI love learning and teaching, so if you attend a Python conference, you might see me give a talk. Before focusing on web development in Python, I worked at multiple early-stage startups, including Quizlet, and taught a course on Web Development at Williams College.\nWhat I’ll Be Doing\nI’ll be attending a number of conferences this year, including DjangoCon Europe, DjangoCon US, PyCon US, EuroPython, and PyTorch. Come say hi if you see me there.\nI’m working on several open tickets around core Django as well as its official documentation.\nAnd I’m excited to learn more about data science this year, exploring ways that it can (or should) overlap with web development, so be on the lookout for future videos, blog posts, and more from me in this area.\nWhat Interests/Excites Me About the Role\nI’ve worked with JetBrains for years as a Django Board Member. Their annual fundraiser is the single biggest contributor to the Django Software Foundation Budget. And the annual Django Developers Survey, which I started up, is now run in conjunction with JetBrains, who helps with the formatting and data analysis. In short, JetBrains is a long-time partner in the open-source community and continues to be.\nAs a Developer Advocate, I will continue to teach what I learn about Python, web development, and data science to the community. Now is a particularly exciting moment as new AI features make their way into text editors and IDEs. There is a lot to figure out around how developers can properly benefit from these tools.\nFun Facts\nI met my wife at the University of St. Andrews, where I lived in the same dorm as Prince William and Kate.\nI was a Book Editor before switching into tech\nI’m a longtime Liverpool FC supporter\n\n\n\n\nConnect\nEmail: william.vincent@jetbrains.com\nGitHub: https://github.com/wsvincent\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/wsvincent.bsky.social \nFosstodon: https://fosstodon.org/@wsvincent",

Below are the highlights from this week’s release.\nKotlin \nJava-to-Kotlin auto-conversion with copy-paste in K2 mode\nWe are getting closer to reaching feature parity between K2 and K1 modes. K1 mode’s auto-conversion for Java code in Kotlin files is a popular feature that makes it easier to cross the barrier between the two languages. Now, in K2 mode, you can also paste Java code and have it automatically translated to Kotlin. If you want to add a Kotlin file to your Java project, Kotlin will also be configured automatically.\n\n\n\n\nFrameworks and technologies\nSupport for Liquibase in the Logical code structure view\nWe’ve improved the Logical code structure view introduced in IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3, expanding it to support additional file types. With IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 EAP 3, you can now enjoy a more meaningful structure representation and streamlined navigation tailored specifically for Liquibase change sets. Easily explore and manage your change sets with an intuitive overview that highlights their logical hierarchy, helping you stay organized and productive when working on database schema changes.\n\n\n\n\nCode completion for nonexistent Spring Data repositories \nIntelliJ IDEA now helps you write code with even fewer distractions by automatically creating Spring Data repositories for you. Simply start typing the entity name, and if the repository doesn’t exist, the IDE will suggest creating one. Choose the repository type and seamlessly continue your work by adding derived query methods and processing the extracted data.\n\n\n\n\nThese are this week’s most noteworthy updates. For the complete list of changes, check out the release notes.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts – share your feedback in the comments below or on X, and report any bugs through our issue tracker.\nStay tuned for more news coming next week, and happy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In this article, we’ll share nine time-saving ways IntelliJ IDEA can boost your productivity when developing Java applications with databases – whether you’re starting a new project or diving into an ongoing one.\nGet IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate\nCreate data sources automatically from properties\nIntelliJ IDEA makes it easy to create a data source for your Spring project right from the application.properties file – simply open it and click on a gutter icon next to the properties. \n\n\n\n\nIn the opened Data Sources and Drivers dialog, you’ll see a data source already assigned and the database-related fields prefilled – all you need to do is to test connectivity (just in case) and click OK. The data source will be created for you.\nTest Spring Data JPA query methods without running the application\nIntelliJ IDEA simplifies Spring Data JPA method query verification! It provides autocompletion for names and the ability to check generated queries without running the application. Just click the dedicated gutter icon to execute repository methods directly in the JPQL console.\n\n\n\n\nReview database schemas as diagrams\nDatabase diagrams are great for quickly grasping the structure of databases and understanding the relationships between their various objects. IntelliJ IDEA can create detailed diagrams for data sources, schemas, or tables to help you analyze the data structure more effectively. To generate a diagram, right-click a database object in the Database tool window and select Diagrams | Show Diagram.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also assign colors to diagram objects to further enhance the way you interact with and comprehend your database structure.\n\n\n\n\nReview query results right in the editor\nIntelliJ IDEA provides a compact way to review query results right in the editor. To enable it, click the In-Editor Results button in the query console before running your query. ​​This is especially useful for working with smaller datasets or data samples.\n\n\n\n\nModify query data in the results set view\nWhen you need to make changes to cell values in IntelliJ IDEA, you don’t have to write and re-run queries! Simply click on a cell value that you want to edit, enter the new value, then click the Submit button (⬆) or ⌘↩/Ctrl+Enter to push changes to the database.\n\n\n\n\nView query results as charts\nCharts provide a powerful and user-friendly way to quickly gain actionable insights from your query results. This feature is particularly useful when analyzing large datasets, looking for patterns, or presenting trends in an easily comprehensible format.\nTo open chart settings, click the Switch to Chart icon on the data editor toolbar. You can choose from a wide range of chart types, including bar charts, pie charts, area charts, line charts, and more, depending on what best suits your needs.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you need to present your findings or keep snapshots of data dynamics, you can export charts in .png format. To save a chart snapshot, simply click the Export to PNG button in Series Settings.\n\n\n\n\nProfile your query with an execution plan\nYou can also visualize execution plans for queries, illustrating the set of steps that were used to access data in a database and the cost of each step – in other words, how long it takes to run the statement. \nTo open the execution plan, right-click an SQL statement, select Explain Plan | Explain Plan, and then click on the Show Diagram icon.\n\n\n\n\nUse DB migration libraries to update application databases\nDatabase schemas evolve over time as business requirements change, and database schema updates and migration can be tricky and error-prone when done manually. Instead, take advantage of IntelliJ IDEA’s built-in support for automatically generating migration scripts based on existing JPA entities. For more information, refer to this article.\n\n\n\n\nLeverage AI Assistant\nAI Assistant makes data query and managing data faster and more efficient. It helps speed up SQL query generation, provides explanations, suggests fixes, and can even generate test data tables!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy following these tips, you can optimize your workflow, save time, and make working with databases more productive and enjoyable. Check out this page to learn more about the database tools in IntelliJ IDEA.\nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Our commitment to you\nWe remain fully committed, as we have been all these years, to developing YouTrack as a platform that evolves with your needs. Our promise to you is to ensure that YouTrack continues to be available in both Server and Cloud versions, giving you the freedom to choose the hosting option that best fits your organization and data governance policies.\nLearning from experience as teams choose YouTrack\nYouTrack is growing faster than ever, with a double-digit percentage increase in the customer base over the last year. We see adoption increasing in various team functions across small and medium enterprises. Together with our consulting partners, we work closely to help the largest enterprises with thousands of employees migrate their processes to YouTrack.\nWe know how tough it is to find the right project management tools – so many are out there! Teams often spend months exploring solutions to find the one that fits their needs.\nMany teams switch to YouTrack to save costs without losing functionality or to find a server solution suitable for teams of a few to several hundred employees. Others transition from lightweight tools or development-specific issue-tracking platforms to gain more flexibility for growing teams and to bring various departments to work together. Some are just beginning their journey, moving from email or chat-based coordination to smart solutions like YouTrack that can support the existing business flows.\nAfter adopting YouTrack, many teams have shared invaluable feedback, shaping our immediate priorities for 2025 and our roadmap for the future. Still, we remain flexible with our planning, leaving room to respond to your needs while staying true to our long-term vision and commitment to YouTrack as a flexible and powerful solution.\nA bold new design for YouTrack\nThe big step in 2025\nWe’ll start 2025 with a bold new look and feel for YouTrack, introducing changes that reflect years of learning and exploration into how teams work on projects.\nNew navigation panel\nThe main menu will move from the top to the left side of the screen, accommodating the growing number of features and pages in YouTrack. We aim to make all the YouTrack key sections more accessible, reducing clicks and making navigation faster for all users. Starting in early 2025, the new navigation panel will be enabled by default for all users. While you will temporarily have the option to switch back to the old one in version 2025.1, we recommend embracing the new interface as we hope it will become the standard by midyear.\n\n\n\n\nProject hierarchy path for tasks, tickets, and articles\nThis project-centric hierarchy will provide clickable breadcrumb paths for tasks, tickets, and articles, allowing you to navigate through project-related information effortlessly. For example, if you’re part of a design team contributing to a specific project, you will only ever be a couple of clicks away from any of the tasks and articles related to your design project.\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned Issues page\nOne of the main differences between YouTrack Lite and Classic has been the layout of the Issues page. This meant that if you had a layout preference, your choice between YouTrack Lite and Classic was restricted. You don’t need to worry about that anymore! The unified Issues page will eliminate the need to choose between Classic and Lite, combining their capabilities into a unified experience. It will include customizable settings, allowing you to tailor your task list to a table or list view with as much or as little detail as you need. We’re also working to improve the way you can search and filter tasks. Once implemented, this redesign will be the default, and there will not be an option to revert it.\n\n\n\n\nFurther UX improvements for everyone\nLater in 2025 and beyond, we will focus on expanding and enriching the new design with:\nRevamped project pages for teams to stay connected to their work context.\nAdvanced project-centric navigation to keep you in your project’s context when needed.\nA My Work page with a personalized view designed to help you focus on your tasks and priorities.\nOnboarding for new users to guide them more easily through YouTrack’s features and help them be productive from day one.\nAI assistance for team members and managers\nWe’re dedicating resources to delivering AI automation features for team members and their project managers. The free AI assistance that comes out of the box in YouTrack will be enhanced with options that are useful in daily work.\nLet AI complete content for you. We are improving AI’s ability to suggest text completions, making drafting tasks or updates faster and more intuitive.\nTask field suggestions from AI. Intelligent suggestions for completing fields in your tasks can streamline work and help you provide critical details effortlessly in no time.\nFuture AI capabilities. Looking ahead, we are working hard to implement the AI-based automation of your routine at a new level. We want to make it possible for you to start your day by reviewing the jobs done for you by AI agents and approving suggestions for moving forward with your projects, either in YouTrack or in the other connected systems.\nExpanding Helpdesk for internal and B2B support teams\nWhile our Helpdesk solution currently allows standard users to be contributors when they are involved in helping your support teams with customer tickets, our customer feedback has highlighted another important scenario – internal helpdesk projects. In these cases, standard users also need to be able to act as reporters in internal helpdesk or service desk setups. To address this, we will also focus on improving the user interface for tickets submitted by internal reporters, improving email notifications for internal reporters, ensuring proper visibility and comment settings for users, and resolving other issues related to ticket visibility and comments for such a scenario.\nOur long-term goal with the Helpdesk solution is to introduce advanced capabilities for separating and managing client organizations within it. This will enable B2B support teams to provide tailored experiences for different clients.\nMore flexibility for project managers\nPlanning canvas\nWe’re working on introducing a planning canvas to make project planning more visual and collaborative. This feature will allow teams to start working using a whiteboard-style interface where ideas can be drafted and transformed into actionable tasks with just a few clicks. Teams will also be able to move existing tasks to the canvas for better visualization and interactive adjustments.\nCustomized naming for tasks\nWould you like to call your tasks something other than “issues”? You may want to call them “documents” for legal projects, “purchase orders” for finance ones, or “jobs” or “employees” for HR and recruitment workflows. We’re continuing to work on a feature that will give you the flexibility to tailor the naming and structure of your entries when starting a specific project.\nMore apps for your teams\nYouTrack apps already allow you to add significant functionality, including entire new pages. For example, the Diagram Editor app lets teams create and manage visual diagrams directly within YouTrack.\nWe are committed to further supporting our partners and customers in building apps. If you have an idea for a new app or feature, feel free to contact us – we’d love to collaborate and discuss how we can help.\n\n\n\n\nExtended enterprise features\nIn relation to YouTrack Server, for our large enterprise customers, we plan to introduce more tools to help you monitor database performance and manage workloads effectively. These updates will help teams ensure stability and optimize resource usage as they scale.\nWe’ll prioritize Docker images as the primary method for installing and upgrading server instances, with .zip distribution support ending in early 2025. As containerized deployments offering secure and isolated environments become the IT standard, we aim to align with industry best practices by focusing exclusively on containerized solutions. \nFor YouTrack Cloud, we’re committed to providing a guaranteed cloud service uptime of 99.99% and confirming this in our terms of service.\nWe’re also expanding single sign-on (SSO) support to include automated user provisioning and deprovisioning. Okta and Entra ID integration improvements are coming in early in 2025, with additional updates to follow. To further enhance user management for enterprise teams, we’re introducing:\nSCIM 2.0 protocol support to further enhance user management capabilities.\nOIDC protocol support to make it possible to sign-in with even more identity providers.\nLet’s shape the future of YouTrack together\nWe’d love to hear from you! Your feedback shapes YouTrack’s future, and we’re always open to ideas, suggestions, and insights. Whether you want to share a feature request, an improvement suggestion, or just your thoughts, get in touch with us by commenting on this blog or using our public project tracker. \nThank you for being a part of the YouTrack community. Together, we’re building a more powerful YouTrack for 2025 and beyond.\nYour YouTrack team,\nCelebrating 15 years with you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nA typical Java or Kotlin programmer spends most of their productive time either creating application code in an editor or searching for bugs in a debugger. Occasionally, they might dive into a profiler when looking for places where the application spends too much time. However, they almost never venture into the Java C1 or C2 compilers and their resulting products – low-level assembly code. For the most part, the Java compilers are black boxes that typically remain closed under normal circumstances.\nSome time ago, I tried to analyze the startup of larger projects, such as IntelliJ IDEA. When analyzing program startup in a JIT-based virtual machine, it’s essential to realize that standard profiling tools don’t provide an accurate picture of CPU load or the performance of individual methods. The final times are distorted because some code runs in a non-optimized form and some CPU capacity is used for compiling methods. This led me to search for a tool that could display compilation processes, and that’s how I found JITWatch.\nThis article introduces JITWatch4i, an IntelliJ IDEA plugin based on JITWatch, designed for analyzing and visualizing compilation processes directly within IntelliJ IDEA. After laying a theoretical foundation with a general overview of Java’s tiered compilation process, we’ll demonstrate the plugin in action, comparing IntelliJ IDEA’s startup speed under different values of the -XX:TieredOldPercentage parameter.\nJITWatch\nDeveloped by Chris Newland, JITWatch is a Java program that analyzes JVM (HotSpot) compilation logs and provides a detailed analysis of the behavior of both compilers in the Java Virtual Machine.\nWhy JITWatch4i?\nFrom my point of view, the original JITWatch is undoubtedly a useful tool for analyzing JIT processes in the JVM. However, while using it, I encountered several issues that made my work more difficult:\nConfiguration requires you to set paths to source files, that is, to all modules containing code for the analyzed project. For large applications like IntelliJ IDEA, whose complete structure you may not even know, this is quite time-consuming.\nConfiguration requires you to set class locations, essentially duplicating the classpath of the analyzed program.\nJITWatch uses JavaFX for its UI. It takes a long time to visualize a project with tens of thousands of compilations in JavaFX, and some charts are practically unusable.\nInstalling and running JITWatch isn’t complicated, but it also isn’t a one-click process.\nWhen I used JITWatch, I particularly struggled with its lack of direct integration into a modern development environment – specifically the environment of the project I was working on. Eventually, I concluded that such an integration could bring new life to this great project, which led me to create JITWatch4i.\nJITWatch4i is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that integrates the JIT analysis visualization features of the original JITWatch directly into the IDE. Integration with IntelliJ IDEA removes the need to manually configure paths to source code or compiled classes, as the IDE already has information about the structure of the currently open project and its dependencies, which the plugin can directly use.\nFurthermore, the original JavaFX framework was replaced with the older but simpler Swing library, which is significantly optimized in the JetBrains Runtime. As a result, visualizing large projects is still reasonably fast, even when dealing with a large number of compilations.\nTypical JITWatch use cases\nAccording to the documentation of the original JITWatch project, this tool is useful in several key areas. It allows you to:\nVerify whether methods you consider performance-critical were JIT-compiled during program execution.\nFind out exactly when certain methods were compiled and better understand the impact of JVM compilation threshold settings.\nLearn how long the compilation of individual methods took, which ones took the compiler the longest, or which generated the most native code.\nBetter understand how Java compilers work.\nTrack how your source code is translated into bytecode and ultimately into machine code.\nIntroduction to Java compilation\nTo delve further into this topic, it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of Java compilers.\nFundamentally, the JVM contains an interpreter, which is used for a limited number of initial method calls, and two main compilers:\nC1, which is capable of quickly generating less-optimized native code. By default, C1 generates code that also collects profiling statistics later used by C2. This mode is called tiered compilation.\nC2, although slower than C1, creates code that is significantly faster. C2 leverages statistics collected by the code compiled with C1 to decide how to optimize the code. Statistics for a given method are gathered while it is running in an interpreter or in code compiled with additional profile-gathering code.\nCompilation levels\nIn this context, you’ll often hear about five compilation levels labeled L0–L4:\nL0 – A term indicating that a method is executed in the interpreter, during which basic statistics, such as the number of calls and backward jumps, are collected.\nL1 – C1 compilation that does not include profiling for C2. It provides the fastest possible output from C1 and is mainly used for trivial methods where deep optimization in C2 wouldn’t provide a significant benefit.\nL2 – C1 compilation with limited profiling, with statistics collected on the number of method calls and backward jumps. This allows us to determine which methods are actively used so that their subsequent compilations can be planned. L2-compiled code is on average about 30% faster than L3-compiled code. At application startup, when the C2 compiler is overloaded, it’s more time-efficient to compile code using L2. If the method remains active, the scheduler’s decision mechanism will later choose to compile it at L4.\nL3 – C1 compilation with full profiling. Unlike L2, this level also gathers statistics on conditional branches and information about which classes are used in the method. L3 code is the slowest compiled code produced by the C1 compiler. The compiler scheduler aims to minimize the time a method spends running in L3 code.\nL4 – Compilation with C2, which leverages the statistics collected previously. This makes it possible to generate faster, more efficient native code.\nCompilation queue\nThe JVM uses a compilation queue to manage and prioritize tasks across compiler threads. Methods are queued based on a compilation policy that prioritizes those likely to benefit most from optimization, ensuring the efficient use of resources and delivering performance gains.\nCompilation parameters\nDuring its lifetime, a single method can run under 5 different compilation levels (L0–L4). Transitions between the per-method compilation levels (L1–L4) in the JVM are controlled by a set of key parameters. These parameters dictate when a particular method is promoted to a higher level of optimization, which in turn influences both startup speed and long-term performance. Below are the most important ones:\n-XX:Tier3InvocationThreshold – The number of calls required to transition to L3. Default value: 2,000.\n-XX:Tier4InvocationThreshold – The number of calls required to transition to L4 (C2). Default value: 15,000.\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage – A somewhat mysterious parameter that significantly impacts startup speed. It specifies the percentage threshold after which a method is considered old and ceases to be prioritized, based on the length of the compilation queue. Default value: 1000.\nThese parameters influence how quickly methods transition between compilation levels. Compilation levels are normally upgraded, with the exceptions being cases of deoptimization or when the C2 compiler is overloaded. Lowering these parameters accelerates the progression of code through its compilation levels, effectively speeding up its “maturity.” However, this comes at the cost of increased overhead during application startup, as methods are compiled more frequently and at earlier stages.\nAnalyzing the startup of IntelliJ IDEA\nOne use case for the JITWatch4i plugin is analyzing an application’s startup. Let’s demonstrate this with an example of IntelliJ IDEA’s startup under different values of the -XX:TieredOldPercentage parameter. For simplicity, we’ll compare two tests: one with -XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000, which is the default value in IntelliJ IDEA, and another with -XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000, which is the default value in the JVM.\nTo analyze the startup, we need to run IntelliJ IDEA with parameters that generate compilation logs, which we will then load into JITWatch4.\nFor the first test, we set the following in idea64.vmoptions (the configuration of TieredOldPercentage is already in use):\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000\n-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions\n-XX:+LogCompilation\n-XX:LogFile=compilation_100k.log\nFor the second test, we set this in idea64.vmoptions:\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000\n-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions\n-XX:+LogCompilation\n-XX:LogFile=compilation_1k.log\nFor easier comparison, we use the following command to make IntelliJ IDEA run for the same amount of time in both cases:\ntimeout --kill-after=5 20 ./idea.sh\nWe load the compilation logs into JITWatch4i and compare them using the Timeline and Comp. Activity tabs.\nTimeline\nThe graph on the Timeline tab illustrates the L1–L4 compilations over time, with each line color representing a specific compilation level:\nBlack – Total compilations\nBlue – L1\nRed – L2\nMagenta – L3\nGreen – L4\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000\n\n\n\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the charts, it’s clear that:\nWith -XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000, there are far more L2 (red line) compilations than with -XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000. Typically, a method follows the path L0 → L3 → L4 unless the C2 compiler is overloaded. When C2 is overloaded, a method may be compiled from L0 to L2 instead of to L3. Whether a method takes the L2 path or skips straight to L3 or L4 depends on how busy the C2 compiler is and whether the method is considered “old”.\nIf the compiler is overloaded, the method may go to L2.\nIf the method is old, L2 is skipped entirely and the method goes from L0 to L3 or L3 to L4.\nThe TieredOldPercentage parameter determines when a method is considered old by adjusting the JVM *Threshold parameters at which a method changes levels. Once a method is classified as old, the JVM stops routing it through L2. An issue arises, however, when the C2 compiler is overloaded and unable to accept new tasks, which means methods cannot graduate from L3 to L4, leaving them stuck at L3 for an extended period. This slows performance because L3 compilation involves collecting extensive statistics.\nThe charts show that for -XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000, the numbers of L3 and L4 compilations are almost the same. In this case, methods that do not progress to L4 remain in L2 instead of being promoted to or staying in the slower L3 code. L2 code is approximately 30% faster than L3 code, so this configuration avoids generating an excess of slower L3 methods. As a result, IntelliJ IDEA starts faster with this parameter.\nCompilation queue\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000\n\n\n\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000\n\n\n\nIn the Compiler Queues chart on the Comp.Activity tab, you can see the length of the compiler queue over time. Comparing them reveals that the -XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000 queue is initially more overloaded than the -XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000 queue.\nCompilation activity\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=100000\n\n\n\n-XX:TieredOldPercentage=1000\n\n\n\nLet’s compare the lengths of individual method compilations in the Native Size chart on the Comp.Activity tab. The X-axis represents time, and the rectangles correspond to the compilation of individual methods. The height of a rectangle is proportional to the length of the resulting native method. It is apparent that the compilation of some methods in C2 is truly long. \nFurther gains may be achievable by postponing the compilation of methods in C2 that take a long time. Initial experiments suggest this does yield results. Though the improvements have only been marginal so far, further tweaking the set of postponed methods could boost them.\nConclusion\nJITWatch4i expands the capabilities of the original JITWatch through a plugin-based integration with IntelliJ IDEA, eliminating source-path setups and speeding up visualization for large projects. The example of IntelliJ IDEA’s startup under different -XX:TieredOldPercentage values shows how the JVM balances quick-to-compile L2 code versus slower but highly optimized L4 code. Using the analysis in JITWatch4i, these optimization steps become transparent, allowing you to understand the impact of your settings and ultimately leading to more informed performance tuning and faster startup times.\nReferences:\nJITWatch4i\nJITWatch",

The recent PHP 8.2.27 release marked the end of its active support phase.\n    \nPHPStan 2.0 has been released\n        This update introduces Level 10 code analysis with stricter handling of mixed types, and adds support for the List type. You can also expect reduced memory consumption and improved performance.\n        Markus Staab shares interesting technical insights about improving PHPStan:\nA mixed type PHPStan journey, PHPStan performance on different hardware, My new PHPStan focus: multi-phpversion support.\n    \n🎂 The PHP Foundation turned three\n\n        The PHP Foundation was established three years ago. Over the past year, the PHP Foundation has supported the work of ten core developers, and made a significant contribution to the PHP language.\n        Consider supporting the PHP Foundation via OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors.\n        The PHP Foundation has been also active with developments:\nPHP 8.4: How Property Hooks Happened – Larry Garfield details the decade-long journey of implementing Property Hooks in PHP 8.4.\nThe PHP Installer for Extensions php/pie reached version 0.5!\nPie: new extension installer for PHP post by Grzegorz Korba.\n            \nRector 2.0\n5 new features.\n    \nFrankenPHP 1.3\nConductor – Automatic dependency updates for Composer\nYou can now run code examples directly on the php.net website\nPHP Core\n✅ RFC: Add persistent curl share handles\n\n        PHP 8.5 will bring a new function curl_share_init_persistent(), which would allow cURL handles to be stored in global memory and reused in subsequent requests.\n        Persistence allows PHP scripts to eliminate the overhead of establishing a connection (and DNS lookups, SSL session IDs, etc.) and can improve performance and reliability.\n    \n✅ RFC: Support Closures in constant expressions\n        In PHP 8.5 it will be possible to use closures in previously\nIn attribute parameters,\nAs default values of properties and parameters.\nConstants and class constants.\n✅ RFC: Attributes on Constants\n        Attributes were first introduced in the RFC: Attributes v2. Daniel Scherzer proposes to add support for attributes on compile-time non-class constants.\n✅ RFC: Error Backtraces v2\n\n        Previously, unlike exceptions, PHP errors did not provide backtraces, which made it difficult to figure out their underlying cause. PHP 8.5 will come with a new ini setting fatal_error_backtraces=1 which will generate detailed error messages and trace for E_ERRORs.\n    \n📣 RFC: Records vs. RFC: Data Class vs. RFC: Structs\n        Apparently, there is a big interest in the community to add a simple native way of creating Value Objects in PHP.\n        Which one would you prefer?\n    \n\n    \nTools\nringPHP/php-mrloop – A PHP port of the mrloop eventware designed to harness the powers of io_uring.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Views are central to Django’s architecture pattern, and having a solid grasp of how to work with them is essential for any developer working with the framework. If you’re new to developing web apps with Django or just need a refresher on views, we’ve got you covered. \nGaining a better understanding of views will help you make faster progress in your Django project. Whether you’re working on an API backend or web UI flows, knowing how to use views is crucial.\nRead on to discover what Django views are, their different types, best practices for working with them, and examples of use cases.\nWhat are Django views?\nViews are a core component of Django’s MTV (model-template-view) architecture pattern. They essentially act as middlemen between models and templates, processing user requests and returning responses.\nYou may have come across views in the MVC (model-view-controller) pattern. However, these are slightly different from views in Django and don’t translate exactly. Django views are essentially controllers in MVC, while Django templates roughly align with views in MVC. This makes understanding the nuances of Django views vital, even if you’re familiar with views in an MVC context.\nViews are part of the user interface in Django, and they handle the logic and data processing for web requests made to your Django-powered apps and sites. They render your templates into what the user sees when they view your webpage. Each function-based or class-based view takes a user’s request, fetches the data from its models, applies business logic or data processing, and then prepares and returns an HTTP response to a template.\nThis response can be anything a web browser can display and is typically an HTML webpage. However, Django views can also return images, XML documents, redirects, error pages, and more.\nRendering and passing data to templates\nDjango provides the render() shortcut to make template rendering simple from within views. Using render() helps avoid the boilerplate of loading the template and creating the response manually.\nPyCharm offers smart code completion that automatically suggests the render() function from django.shortcuts when you start typing it in your views. It also recognizes template names and provides autocompletion for template paths, helping you avoid typos and errors.\nThe user provides the request, the template name, and a context dictionary, which gives data for the template. Once the necessary data is obtained, the view passes it to the template, where it can be rendered and presented to the user.\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\n\ndef my_view(request):\n    # Some business logic to obtain data\n    data_to_pass = {'variable1': 'value1', 'variable2': 'value2'}\n\n    # Pass the data to the template\n    return render(request, 'my_template.html', context=data_to_pass)\nIn this example, data_to_pass is a dictionary containing the data you want to send to the template. The render function is then used to render the template (my_template.html) with the provided context data.\nNow, in your template (my_template.html), you can access and display the data.\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Template</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>{{ variable1 }}</h1>\n    <p>{{ variable2 }}</p>\n</body>\n</html>\nIn the template, you use double curly braces ({{ }}) to indicate template variables. These will be replaced with the values from the context data passed by the view.\nPyCharm offers completion and syntax highlighting for Django template tags, variables, and loops. It also provides in-editor linting for common mistakes. This allows you to focus on building views and handling logic, rather than spending time manually filling in template elements or debugging common errors.\n\n\n\n    \nStart with PyCharm Pro for free\n                                                    \nFunction-based views\nDjango has two types of views: function-based views and class-based views.\nFunction-based views are built using simple Python functions and are generally divided into four basic categories: create, read, update, and delete (CRUD). This is the foundation of any framework in development. They take in an HTTP request and return an HTTP response.\nfrom django.http import HttpResponse\n\ndef my_view(request):\n\n    # View logic goes here\n    context = {\"message\": \"Hello world\"}\n\n    return HttpResponse(render(request, \"mytemplate.html\", context))\nThis snippet handles the logic of the view, prepares a context dictionary for passing data to a template that is rendered, and returns the final template HTML in a response object.\nFunction-based views are simple and straightforward. The logic is contained in a single Python function instead of spread across methods in a class, making them most suited to use cases with minimal processing.\nPyCharm allows you to automatically generate the def my_view(request) structure using live templates. Live templates are pre-defined code snippets that can be expanded into boilerplate code. This feature saves you time and ensures a consistent structure for your view definitions.\nYou can invoke live templates simply by pressing ⌘J, typing Listview, and pressing the tab key. \n\n\n\n\nMoreover, PyCharm includes a Django Structure tool window, where you can see a list of all the views in your Django project, organized by app. This allows you to quickly locate views, navigate between them, and identify which file each view belongs to.\n\n\n\n\nClass-based views\nDjango introduced class-based views so users wouldn’t need to write the same code repeatedly. They don’t replace function-based views but instead have certain applications and advantages, especially in cases where complex logic is required.\nClass-based views in Django provide reusable parent classes that implement various patterns and functionality typically needed by web application views. You can take your views from these parent classes to reduce boilerplate code. \nClass-based views offer generic parent classes like:\nListView\nDetailView\nCreateView\nAnd many more.\nBelow are two similar code snippets demonstrating a simple BookListView. The first shows a basic implementation using the default class-based conventions, while the second illustrates how you can customize the view by specifying additional parameters. \nBasic implementation: \nfrom django.views.generic import ListView\nfrom .models import Book \n\nclass BookListView(ListView):\n    model = Book\n    # The template_name is omitted because Django defaults to 'book_list.html' \n    # based on the convention of <model_name>_list.html for ListView.\nWhen BookListView gets rendered, it automatically queries the Book records and passes them under the variable books when rendering book_list.html. This means you can create a view to list objects quickly without needing to rewrite the underlying logic.\nCustomized implementation:\nfrom django.views.generic import ListView\nfrom .models import Book \n\nclass BookListView(ListView):\n\n    model = Book\n\t# You can customize the view further by adding additional attributes or methods \n    def get_queryset(self):\n\t# Example of customizing the queryset to filter books\n\treturn Book.objects.filter(is_available=True)\nIn the second snippet, we’ve introduced a custom get_queryset() method, allowing us to filter the records displayed in the view more precisely. This shows how class-based views can be extended beyond their default functionality to meet the needs of your application. \nClass-based views also define methods that tie into key parts of the request and response lifecycle, such as: \nget() – logic for GET requests.\npost() – logic for POST requests.\ndispatch() – determines which method to call get() or post().\nThese types of views provide structure while offering customization where needed, making them well-suited to elaborate use cases.\nPyCharm offers live templates for class-based views like ListView, DetailView, and TemplateView, allowing you to generate entire view classes in seconds, complete with boilerplate methods and docstrings.\n\n\n\n\nCreating custom class-based views\nYou can also create your own view classes by subclassing Django’s generic ones and customizing them for your needs. \nSome use cases where you might want to make your own classes include:\nAdding business logic, such as complicated calculations.\nMixing multiple generic parents to blend functionality.\nManaging sessions or state across multiple requests.\nOptimizing database access with custom queries. \nReusing common rendering logic across different areas. \nA custom class-based view could look like this:\nfrom django.views.generic import View\nfrom django.shortcuts import render\nfrom . import models\n\nclass ProductSalesView(View):\n\n    def get(self, request):\n     \n        # Custom data processing \n        sales = get_sales_data()\n        \n        return render(request, \"sales.html\", {\"sales\": sales})\n\n    def post(self, request):\n\n        # Custom form handling\n        form = SalesSearchForm(request.POST)  \n        if form.is_valid():\n            results = models.Sale.objects.filter(date__gte=form.cleaned_data['start_date'])\n            context = {\"results\": results}\n            return render(request, \"search_results.html\", context)\n            \n        # Invalid form handling\n        errors = form.errors\n        return render(request, \"sales.html\", {\"errors\": errors})\nHere, custom get and post handlers enable you to extend the existing ones between requests.\nWhen to use each view type\nFunction-based and class-based views can both be useful depending on the complexity and needs of the view logic. \nThe main differences are that class-based views:\nPromote reuse via subclassing and parents inheriting behavior.\nAre ideal for state management between requests.\nProvide more structure and enforced discipline.\nYou might use them working with:\nDashboard pages with complex rendering logic. \nPublic-facing pages that display dynamic data.\nAdmin portals for content management.\nList or detail pages involving database models.\nOn the other hand, function-based views:\nAre simpler and take less code to create.\nCan be easier for Python developers to grasp.\nAre highly flexible and have fewer constraints.\nTheir use cases include: \nPrototyping ideas.\nSimple CRUD or database views.\nLanding or marketing pages. \nAPI endpoints for serving web requests.\nIn short, function-based views are flexible, straightforward, and are easier to reason about. However, for more complex cases, you’ll need to create more code that you can’t reuse.\nClass-based views in Django enforce structure and are reusable, but they can be more challenging to understand and implement, as well as harder to debug.\nViews and URLs\nAs we’ve established, in Django, views are the functions or classes that determine how a template is rendered. Each view links to a specific URL pattern, guiding incoming requests to the right place.\nUnderstanding the relationship between views and URLs is important for managing your application’s flow effectively. \nEvery view corresponds with a URL pattern defined in your Django app’s urls.py file. This URL mapping ensures that when a user navigates to a specific address in your application, Django knows exactly which view to invoke. \nLet’s take a look at a simple URL configuration: \nfrom django.urls import path\nfrom .views import BookListView\n\nurlpatterns = [\n    path('books/', BookListView.as_view(), name='book-list'),\n]\nIn this setup, when a user visits /books/, the BookListView kicks in to render the list of books. By clearly mapping URLs to views, you make your codebase easier to read and more organized.\nSimplify URL management with PyCharm\nManaging and visualizing endpoints in Django can become challenging as your application grows. PyCharm addresses this with its Endpoints tool window, which provides a centralized view of all your app’s URL patterns, linked views, and HTTP methods. This feature allows you to see a list of every endpoint in your project, making it easier to track which views are tied to specific URLs. \nInstead of searching through multiple urls.py files, you can instantly locate and navigate to the corresponding views with just a click. This is especially useful for larger Django projects where URL configurations span multiple files or when working in teams where establishing context quickly is crucial.\nFurthermore, the Endpoints tool window lets you visualize all endpoints in a table-like interface. Each row displays the URL path, the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.), and the associated view function or class of a given endpoint. \nThis feature not only boosts productivity but also improves code navigation, allowing you to spot missing or duplicated URL patterns with ease. This level of visibility is invaluable for debugging routing issues or onboarding new developers to a project.\nCheck out this video for more information on the Endpoints tool window and how you can benefit from it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practices for using Django views\nHere are some guidelines that can help you create well-structured and maintainable views.\nKeep views focused\nViews should concentrate on handling requests, fetching data, passing data to templates, and controlling flow and redirects. Complicated business logic and complex processing should happen elsewhere, such as in model methods or dedicated service classes. \nHowever, you should be mindful not to overload your models with too much logic, as this can lead to the “fat model” anti-pattern in Django. Django’s documentation on views provides more insights about structuring them properly. \nKeep views and templates thin\nIt’s best to keep both views and templates slim. Views should handle request processing and data retrieval, while templates should focus on presentation with minimal logic.\nComplex processing should be done in Python outside the templates to improve maintainability and testing. For more on this, check out the Django templates documentation.\nDecouple database queries\nExtracting database queries into separate model managers or repositories instead of placing them directly in views can help reduce duplication. Refer to the Django models documentation for guidance on managing database interactions effectively. \nUse generic class-based views when possible\nDjango’s generic class-based views, like DetailView and ListView, provide reusability without requiring you to write much code. Opt for using them over reinventing the wheel to make better use of your time. The generic views documentation is an excellent resource for understanding these features. \nFunction-based views are OK for simple cases\nFor basic views like serving APIs, a function can be more effective than a class. Reserve complex class-based views for intricate UI flows. The writing views documentation page offers helpful examples.\nStructure routes and URLs cleanly\nOrganize routes and view handlers by grouping them into apps by functionality. This makes it easier to find and navigate the source. Check out the Django URL dispatcher documentation for best practices in structuring your URL configurations. \nNext steps \nNow that you have a basic understanding of views in Django, you’ll want to dig deeper into the framework and other next steps.\nBrush up on your Django knowledge with our How to Learn Django blog post, which is ideal for beginners or those looking to refresh their expertise.\nDiscover how to create and run your first Django project in PyCharm, with our tutorial on crafting a basic to-do application, or explore our complete list of Django project ideas for further inspiration. \nExplore the state of Django to see the latest trends in Django development for further inspiration.\nIf you’re still deciding which Python framework to use, our Django vs. Flask and Django vs. FastAPI comparison guides can help.\nDjango support in PyCharm\nPyCharm Professional is the best-in-class IDE for Django development.

모든 플레이어가 네트워크 효과를 활용하는 시장에서 제품은 어떻게 경쟁해야 할까요?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트. 책 제목만 보면 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;시작이 어렵다&lt;/code&gt;는 느낌이 든다. 이는 맞는 말이다. 그런데 “시작” 중에서도 사용자 간 연결을 기반으로 한 제품을 만들려 할 때 겪게 될 어려움에 대해 이야기하는 책이다. 스타트업 팀이든 누군가 제품을 만들 때 겪게 될 이런 어려움과 해결 방법들에 대해서 사례 기반으로 알려준다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;저자인 앤드류 첸(Andrew Chen)에 대해서도 알아두면 좋은데(워낙 유명한 분이라..), a16z(Andreessen Horowitz)에서 파트너로 활동하며 소셜, 마켓플레이스, 엔터테인먼트, 게임, AI 등 기술 산업 분야에 투자하고 있다. 앤드류가 운영하고 있는 뉴스레터는 20만 명 이상의 구독자가 있다고… 이 책에는 흔히 들어봤을 성공한 스타트업들 이야기가 굉장히 많이 나오는데, 그중에서도 Uber 이야기가 가장 많이 나온다. 앤드류 첸은 이전에 Uber에서 라이더 그로스 부분의 총 책임자(Head of Rider Growth)로 재직하며 플랫폼의 활성 사용자 수를 1,500만에서 1억 명까지 성장시키는데 기여했다. 앤드류 첸 본인의 성공과 실패 경험, 그리고 스타트업들의 유스케이스를 분석해서 다양한 제품과 산업에 적용할 수 있는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 이론&lt;/code&gt; 이라는 프레임워크와 원칙을 만들었고, 그 중에서도 네트워크 효과를 활용하는 제품이 왜 그토록 중요한지 이야기해주고 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;네트워크-효과-network-effects&quot;&gt;네트워크 효과 Network Effects&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;네트워크를 사용하는 사람들이 늘어날수록 네트워크가 사용자들에게 더 가치 있어진다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;네트워크 효과(Network Effects)&lt;/strong&gt;는 제품을 사용하는 사람들이 늘어날수록 제품의 가치가 높아지고, 네트워크가 사용자들에게 더 가치 있어진다고 설명할 때 쓰는 용어다. 이 문장만 봐서는 정확히 무슨 말인지 잘 모르겠다. 어떤 제품을 만드는 메이커 입장에서 네트워크란 무엇일까? 이를 사용자와 연관 지어 생각해 보면, 이런 답을 도출해 볼 수 있다. &lt;strong&gt;연결된 사용자 간의 상호 작용&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;우리가 사용하는 많은 제품이나 서비스는 플랫폼 내 다른 사용자들과의 연결을 통해 가치를 만들어낸다. 예를 들어, Uber는 특정 도시에 운행할 기사와 승객을 연결해 주고, Airbnb는 특정 도시에 방을 제공할 호스트와 여행자를 연결해 준다. 이러한 제품에서는 네트워크 효과가 제품의 가치를 만들어낸다. 그래서 Uber에 특정 도시에 운행할 기사가 없으면 승객 입장에서는 제품이 쓸모없어지고, 이탈로 이어진다. 마찬가지로, Airbnb에 특정 도시에 방을 제공할 호스트가 없으면 사용자 입장에서는 아무리 제품을 잘 만들었더라도 가치가 떨어지고 만다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;네트워크 효과는 이 책의 처음부터 끝까지 빠지지 않고 등장하는 중요한 개념이다. 책의 제목인 Cold Start는 단어가 270번 나오는 것에 비해, Network Effect는 총 301번 등장한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제품을 만드는 사람들에게 네트워크 효과가 왜 중요할까? 정답은 &lt;strong&gt;쉬워진 제품 출시와 치열한 경쟁 속에서 살아남기 위한 차별화&lt;/strong&gt;에 있다. 이제 AI 도구를 사용하지 않으면 바보가 되는 세상이 되었다. 간단한 프로토타이핑은 기본이고, 상용 제품도 Bolt, v0, Replit 같은 도구를 활용하면 쉽게 만들 수 있다. 또한, 잘 만들어진 SaaS, No Code(Low Code) 툴이 너무 많고, 클라우드 환경도 날이 갈수록 발전하고 있어 제품을 만드는 팀 입장에서는 제품 출시의 벽이 정말 낮아졌다. 그래서 이제는 제품 성공에서 속도가 중요한 시대는 지난 것 같다. 제품 출시는 쉬워졌고, 경쟁은 갈수록 치열해지고 있다. 그렇기 때문에 경쟁 제품으로부터 방어할 수 있는 차별화된 네트워크를 구축하는 것이 중요하다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;대부분의 새로운 제품은 첫 시장 진입에 실패하고 사라진다. 그리고 그들의 네트워크는 시작도 하기 전에 붕괴하고 만다. 네트워크 효과가 모두 강력하고 긍정적인 힘이라는 것은 근거 없는 믿음이며, 사실은 정반대다. 아래에서도 나오지만, 작은 규모의 네트워크는 자연적으로 자신을 파괴하려고 한다. 사람들이 어떤 제품을 보러 갔을 때, 그것을 사용하고 있는 지인이나 동료가 아무도 없다면 자연스럽게 떠나고 말 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 문제를 어떻게 해결할 수 있을까? 다음 장에서 살펴볼 원자 네트워크(충분히 사람이 떠나지 않을 만큼의 최소한의 네트워크)가 답이 될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;콜드-스타트-이론-cold-start-theory&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 이론 Cold Start Theory&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)은 모든 제품을 만드는 팀이 네트워크 효과를 온전히 활용하기 위해 거쳐야 할 일련의 단계를 프레임워크로 정리한 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/stages-cold-start-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;The stages of the Cold Start framework&quot; title=&quot;The stages of the Cold Start framework&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;콜드-스타트-문제-the-cold-start-problem&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 문제 The Cold Start Problem:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;새로운 영상 공유 앱이 출시되었다. 그런데 앱에 다양한 콘텐츠가 없다 보니 사용자들은 오래 머물지 않는다. 마켓플레이스와 소셜 네트워크 등을 포함하여 B2B 서비스도 마찬가지다. 사용자가 자신이 원하는 사람이나 물건을 찾지 못하면 서비스에서 이탈한다. 이것이 바로 콜드 스타트 문제(The Cold Start Problem)이며, 초기 이탈 문제를 해결하기 위해 적절한 사용자와 콘텐츠를 동일한 네트워크에 동시에 모으는 것이 필수적이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Anti-network effects; the network effects that startups love so much actually hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 문장이 인상 깊었는데, 대부분의 경우 스타트업들이 그토록 사랑하는 네트워크 효과는 실제로 그들에게 해가 된다고 한다. 제품에 네트워크를 구축해야 살아남는 세계에서, 제대로 된 네트워크가 없으면 이는 자기 파괴적인 관계로 돌아선다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;누구나 거쳐가야 할 초기 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하기 위해 Wikipedia의 콘텐츠 제작자, 신용카드의 발명 과정, Zoom의 제품 출시 과정 이야기가 자세하게 소개되었다. 여기서 강조된 개념이 &lt;strong&gt;원자 네트워크(Atomic Network)&lt;/strong&gt; 였는데, &lt;strong&gt;최소한의 규모로도 안정적으로 작동하고 스스로 성장할 수 있는 네트워크&lt;/strong&gt;를 의미한다. 예를 들어, Zoom의 화상회의 서비스는 단 2명의 사용자만으로도 작동할 수 있지만, Airbnb는 하나의 시장에 수백 개의 활성화된 숙소 리스트가 있어야 안정적인 네트워크가 형성된다. 그래서 이 단계에 있는 팀이나 제품에게는 우리 제품의 Atomic Network가 무엇인지(임계치가 얼마인지) 파악하는게 중요하다. 여기서 중요한 것 중 하나는 Atomic Network는 규모가 크지 않고 밀도가 높아야 한다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;가장 규모가 작은 집단을 구축하는 것을 목표로 해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;더 많은 사용자를 포함 시키려 할수록 원자 네트워크를 만드는 것은 어려워진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트 문제에 있어 원자 네트워크 보다 중요한 개념이 있다. 네트워크는 종종 쌍을 이룬 측면을 가지고 있다. Provider ↔ Consumer, Content Creator ↔ Consumer, Driver ↔ Passenger, Male ↔ Female 처럼 말이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, Uber에서는 운전 기사가 있어야 승객이 있고, Tinder에서는 여성 사용자가 있어야 남성 사용자가 있다. 이처럼 초기 원자 네트워크에는 특정한 역학 관계가 작용한다. 또한, 소수의 사용자가 지나치게 많은 가치를 창출하면서 강력한 권력을 차지하게 되는 현상도 발생할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Uber: 상위 20% 드라이버가 전체 60% 승객을 태운다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Tinder: 여성은 5%의 남성을 선택하지만 평균 남성은 45% 여성을 선택한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia: 전체 사용자는 수억명, 월 활성 작성자가 10만명이지만, 100건 이상 글 편집자는 4,000명(0.02%). Steven Pruitt 라는 한 개인은 영문 위키피디아의 1/3을 작성함(35,000개 글, 300만번 이상 수정).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크 내의 유저는 보통 한 쪽이 다른 한 쪽보다 데려오기 어렵다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;소셜 네트워크: 모두가 소비하는 미디어를 만드는 콘텐츠 창작자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;앱스토어: 제품을 제작하는 개발자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;업무용 앱: 문서와 프로젝트를 작성하고 제작하며 동료들을 불러 모으는 관리자&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그리고 이걸 네트워크의 &lt;strong&gt;하드 사이드(Hard Side)&lt;/strong&gt;라고 부른다. 네트워크의 하드 사이드를 관리하고 이들을 만족시키는 것이 원자 네트워크보다 더 중요하다. 따라서 제품이 네트워크 기반으로 성장 하기를 원한다면, 하드 사이드부터 정의하는 것이 중요하다. Uber 와 Tinder도 마찬가지다. 위키피디아 사례를 보면, 고작 0.02%에 불과한 의욕 넘치는 사용자들이 나머지 네트워크를 위해 콘텐츠를 발행한다. 위키피디아의 콘텐츠 창작자들 역시 커뮤니티 자체에 매료되었을 가능성이 높다. 사회적 반응과 지위 등 커뮤니티의 역학 관계가 그들이 계속 콘텐츠를 발행하도록 동기를 부여하는 요소가 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하드 사이드를 정의하고 원자 네트워크를 구축하다 보면 마법의 순간(Magic Moment)이 온다. 여기서는 클럽하우스를 예시로 들었는데, 네트워크가 충분히 채워지고 활성화되어 사람들이 올바른 방식으로 소통할 수 있다면, 그때 Magic Moment가 온다고 한다. 흔히 Magic Moment를 찾는 과정을 Product-Market Fit을 찾는 과정이라고 한다. 그렇다면 Magic Moment를 어떻게 측정할 수 있을까? 이는 반대로 접근해 보면 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시) 우버 ZERO: 승객이 우버 앱을 실행하여 주소를 선택한 후 승차하기로 했을 때 그 지역에 운전기사가 아무도 없는 상황. 네트워크에 있는 다른 사용자들과 상호작용하는 것이 그 상품의 핵심이라면 제로는 그것이 충족될 수 없다는 의미이며, 이는 사용자가 이탈하여 다시는 돌아오지 않을 수도 있다는 뜻이다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;만약 콜드 스타트 문제를 겪고 있다면, 초기 단계에서는 제품에서 빠진 기능을 인간의 노력으로 대체하는 것도 중요하다. 이 책에서는 이를 플린트스토닝(Flintstoning)이라고 표현한다. 초기 네트워크가 형성되면, 플린트스토닝 기법은 가속도를 얻으며 점점 자동화를 향해 진화한다. 네트워크가 스스로 일어설 수 있을 때까지, 중요한 부분을 수동으로 채워 넣는 것이 목표다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마지막으로 Always Be Hustlin. 2012년, Uber는 앱에 등장하는 ‘ICE CREAM’ 버튼을 누르면 우버 블랙 차량을 통해 아이스크림이 배달되는 이벤트를 진행했다. ‘실제로 도움이 되었나요?’라는 질문에 대한 대답은 이렇다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;개별적인 볼거리로는 회사에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았을 수도 있다. 하지만 시장을 제로에서 티핑 포인트까지 끌어올리는 프레임워크 안에서, 이러한 재빠르고 영리한 전술은 시장이 이륙하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했다고 생각한다. 가장 중요한 것은, 우버가 이런 개념을 빠르게 식별하고 실행하며 반복할 수 있는 시스템을 만들었다는 점이다. 이러한 시스템을 구축하는 데 도움을 준 것은 &lt;strong&gt;진취적인 팀 문화, 강력한 소프트웨어 제작 도구, 그리고 각 도시마다 고유한 콜드 스타트 문제가 있다는 것에 대한 이해&lt;/strong&gt;다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;차량 공유 앱에서 아이스크림을 배달해준다? 이벤트만 보면 서비스 성장에 전혀 영향을 미칠것 같지 않다. 그런데 이런 이벤트들은 Uber 1.0 Cultural Values에 기반한 것이고 이걸 보니 정말 많은 시도를 했겠다는 생각이 들었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Magic&lt;/strong&gt;: Seek breakthrough that will stand the test of time&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super pumped&lt;/strong&gt;: The world is a puzzle to be solved with enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside Out&lt;/strong&gt;: Find the gap between popular perception and reality&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be an Owner, Not a Renter&lt;/strong&gt;: Revolutions are won by true believers&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimistic Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;: Be inspiring&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;: Each of us should be authentic&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Bold Bets&lt;/strong&gt;: Take risks and plant seeds that are five to ten years out&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Obsession&lt;/strong&gt;: Start with what’s best for the customer&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Be Hustlin’&lt;/strong&gt;: Get more done with less, working longer, harder, and smarter, not just two out of three&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let Builders Build&lt;/strong&gt;: People must be empowered to build things&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winning&lt;/strong&gt;: Champion’s Mindset&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principled Confrontation&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes the world and institutions need to change in order for the future to be ushered in&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping&lt;/strong&gt;: The best idea always wins.

명씩 찾아가 설득하는 것이 처음 시작할 때는 좋은 방법이라는 의미다. 창립자가 해야 하는 가장 흔한 확장되지 않는 일은 사용자를 직접 선발하는 것이다. 이는 거의 모든 스타트업이 반드시 거쳐야 하는 과정이다. 사용자가 오기를 기다려서는 안 된다. 밖으로 나가 직접 부딪쳐야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;생각해볼만한 재미있는 질문:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 네트워크에 처음부터 있어야 할 가장 중요한 사용자들은 누구이고 그 이유는 무엇인가?&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;원하는 대로 성장할 수 있게 하려면 초기 네트워크의 씨앗을 어떻게 뿌려야 하는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;티핑-포인트-the-tipping-point&quot;&gt;티핑 포인트 The Tipping Point:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;원자 네트워크가 잘 구축되어 콜드 스타트 문제를 극복하면, 네트워크는 어느 순간 폭발적인 성장을 맞이하게 된다. 네트워크가 성장하면서 새로운 네트워크들이 형성되는데, 이 과정이 점점 가속화되며 전체 시장을 훨씬 수월하게 공략할 수 있게 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;LinkedIn: 초대 받은 사람만 사용할 수 있게 설계하여 연결을 통한 선순환을 만들어냄&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Instagram: 사진 보정 도구로 시작해서 팔로우와 공유를 통해 네트워크 효과를 만들어냄&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Uber: 특정 도시에서의 성공 경험을 바탕으로 수요와 공급을 맞춰나가는 전략을 계속해서 반복&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크를 론칭할 때마다, 다음 도미노를 쓰러뜨리는 일이 훨씬 수월해진다. 이 모든 것은 처음 시작된 하나의 작은 성공 덕분이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instagram 처럼 도구와 네트워크가 쌍을 이루는 제품:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;창작 + 사람들과 공유: Instagram, Youtube, Google Workspace, LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;구성 + 사람들과 협업: Pinterest, Asana, Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기록 체계 + 사람들과 최신 정보 유지: OpenTable, GitHub&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;검색 + 사람들과 함께 기부: Zillow, Glassdoor, Yelp&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;이탈-속도-escape-velocity&quot;&gt;이탈 속도 Escape Velocity:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;신제품이 성공적으로 확장하기 시작하면, 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달했다고 표현한다. 각 네트워크가 어느 정도 자리를 잡기 시작하면, 네트워크 효과를 강화하고 성장을 지속하기 위해 미친 듯이 일에만 집중해야 하는 시기가 바로 이때다. 이 단계의 핵심은 재빠르게 높은 성장률을 유지하면서, 성공적인 제품의 네트워크 효과를 극대화하는 것이다. 그래서 이 시점에는 흔히 하키 스틱 커브(hockey stick curve)가 나타난다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이탈 속도에 대해 설명하면서, 네트워크 효과의 아래 세 가지 핵심 요소도 함께 소개했다. 네트워크 기반 제품은 자신의 사적인 네트워크에 있는 사람들에게 제품을 소개할 수 있는 능력을 지니고 있다. 이 능력 덕분에 획득 비용(Acquisition Cost)은 시간이 지나 시장 포화와 경쟁으로 인해 자연스럽게 상승하는 상황에서도 낮게 유지될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;획득 효과(Acquisition Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자가 단순히 제품을 사용하면서도 자연스럽게 새로운 사용자를 유입시키는 효과&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;특정 제품의 사용자가 증가하면서, 사람들이 그 제품을 사용하는 시간이 길어지고 관심이 높아질 때 발생하는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;재활성화(Reactivation)는 일반적으로 신제품에는 큰 우려 사항이 아니다(탈퇴하는 사용자가 적기 때문). 따라서 초점은 신규 사용자 확보에 맞춰져야 한다. 그러나 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity) 단계에 도달한 제품이라면, 수백만 명의 사용자 풀을 활용할 수 있다. 기존 사용자를 다시 참여시키는 것은 신규 사용자를 획득하는 것만큼 중요한 성장 레버가 될 수 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;참여 효과(Engagement Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 확장하면서 신규 고객을 끌어들이는 능력, 즉 바이럴 요소(Viral Factor)&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;제품이 더 많은 사용자를 확보할수록 점점 더 사용자 친화적이고 몰입도가 높아지는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;최근에는 리텐션 곡선(Retention Curves)과 참여 지표(Engagement Metrics)를 활용하여 효과를 측정&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;경제 효과(Economic Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크 효과가 시간이 지남에 따라 비즈니스 모델을 더욱 발전시키는 방식&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 성장하면서 수익화 및 전환율(Conversion Rate)이 향상되는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크 효과가 단순히 사용자 증가뿐만 아니라 비즈니스의 경제적 가치도 향상시킬 수 있는지를 탐구&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시1: 피드 알고리즘 개선, 전환율 증가, 프리미엄 가격 책정(Premium Pricing) 등의 방식으로 수익성 향상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시2: Uber 플랫폼에 운전자가 늘어나면 경쟁 플랫폼에 비해 승객 입장에서의 단가가 낮아지고 그만큼 수요가 즐어나서 수익화와 전환율이 올라간다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;천장-the-ceiling&quot;&gt;천장 The Ceiling:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크가 너무 커지고 포화 상태가 되면, 기존 사용자들은 피로를 느끼고 제품은 성장의 한계에 부딪히게 된다. 이는 네트워크가 최고점에 도달한 후 성장이 교착 상태에 빠지는 현상을 의미한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;여기서 &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewchen.com/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs&quot;&gt;엿 같은 클릭률의 법칙(The Law of Shitty Clickthroughs)&lt;/a&gt;에 대해서 소개했는데 인상 깊었다. 1994년, HotWired 웹사이트에서 최초의 배너 광고가 등장했을 때, 클릭률(CTR)은 무려 78%에 달했다. 그러나 2011년 Facebook에서의 배너 광고 클릭률은 0.05%로, 1500배나 낮아졌다. 이는 단순한 우연이 아니라, 시간이 지남에 따라 모든 마케팅 전략의 클릭률이 감소하는 법칙이 작용한 결과다. 배너 광고뿐만 아니라 이메일, 뉴스레터, 기타 온라인 채널의 성과도 시간이 지나면서 점점 감소한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;클릭률 저하의 주요 원인:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자는 새로움(신선함)에 반응하지만, 이건 금방 사라진다. 새로운 마케팅 기법이 처음 등장하면 사람들은 신기해서 반응하지만, 반복될수록 효과가 급격히 떨어진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;선점 효과는 오래가지 않는다. 만약 당신이 새로운 마케팅 기법을 개발하여 높은 성과를 거둔다면, 경쟁자들은 이걸 빠르게 모방할 것이다. 마케팅 채널이 퍼지면 경쟁으로 인해 성과가 점차 약화된다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;규모가 커질수록 전환율이 낮아진다. 초기 시장(early adaopters)은 새로운 기술이나 제품에 열광하지만, 주류 시장(mainstream market)은 제품이 정말 유용한지를 따진다. 즉, 처음에는 적은 비용으로 높은 효과를 볼 수 있지만, 시간이 지날수록 광고비는 증가하고 전환율은 감소한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;클릭률 저하의 법칙을 극복하는 방법:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;지속적인 개선과 최적화: 새로운 Creative(광고 소재) 테스트, 새로운 퍼블리셔와 광고 네트워크 탐색, 데이터 기반 최적화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;정보 전달형 마케팅 활용: 단순히 “광고”로 접근하는 것이 아니라, 사용자에게 유용한 정보를 제공하는 콘텐츠 마케팅 전략을 활용해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;새로운 마케팅 채널 선점: 아직 경쟁이 치열하지 않은 새로운 마케팅 채널을 먼저 활용하는 것이 중요하다. 남들이 아직 시도하지 않은 마케팅 채널을 개척하면, 높은 성과를 낼 가능성이 크다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 장은 질문과 짧은 답변으로 마무리되었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마케팅 채널을 통해 주당 수백 건의 다운로드가 발생하고 있다면, 다운로드 수를 두 배로 늘리려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 또는 10배, 궁극적으로 1000배 늘리려면? 가장 좋은 방법은 네트워크 효과 여부와 관계없이 꾸준히 새로운 채널을 구축하는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;해자-the-moat&quot;&gt;해자 The Moat:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;성(안정적인 현금 흐름 혹은 이익)이 있으면 그걸 빼앗기 위해 달려드는 적군(경쟁자)이 있고, 그들로부터 방어하기 위해 구덩이를 파고 물을 채워 놓은 것을 해자(Moat)라고 부른다. 경쟁적 해자(Competitive Moat)에 대한 개념은 세계적인 투자자인 Warren Buffett이 인용하면서 유명해졌다. 이 용어는 경쟁 제품에 비해 경쟁 우위를 유지하여 장기적인 수익성과 시장 점유율을 보호할 수 있는 제품의 능력을 의미한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.&lt;br /&gt;\n투자의 핵심은 어떤 산업이 사회에 얼마나 큰 영향을 미칠 것인지 또는 얼마나 성장할 것인지를 평가하는 것이 아닙니다. 오히려 중요한 것은, 개별 기업의 경쟁 우위를 평가하고, 그 경쟁 우위가 얼마나 지속될 수 있는지를 파악하는 것입니다. 넓고 지속 가능한 해자를 가진 제품이나 서비스만이 장기적으로 투자자들에게 높은 보상을 제공할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/moat.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Moat&quot; title=&quot;The Moat&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 글의 도입부에서도 이야기했던 네트워크 제품의 차별점에 대한 내용이다. &lt;strong&gt;차별화된 네트워크를 갖춘 제품은 경쟁자가 쉽게 진입할 수 없다&lt;/strong&gt;는 점에서 강력한 이점을 가진다. 이 시점부터는 네트워크를 기반으로 한 경쟁이 본격적으로 시작된다. 그리고 경쟁자를 물리치기 위한 네트워크 효과가 발동한다. 재미있는 점은, 여기서 경쟁은 단순히 더 좋은 기능이나 실행력에 관한 것만이 아니라, 한 제품의 생태계가 다른 제품의 생태계를 어떻게 위협하는가에 대한 문제로 확장된다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, Airbnb가 시장에서 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달하면, 콜드 스타트 문제(Cold Start Problem)는 새로운 진입자에 대한 방어책이 된다. 결국, 도시에 진입하는 경쟁 제품은 모두 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하여 동일한 밀도를 구축해야 한다. 여러분이 0에서 티핑 포인트(Tipping Point)까지 가는 데 어려움을 겪었던 것처럼, 불리한 조건에서 시작하는 경쟁 업체에게는 더욱 큰 도전이 될 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;해자(Moat)에 대해 설명하면서 선순환과 악순환(Cycle of Virtue and Doom)에 대한 이야기도 흥미로웠다. 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 따르면, 경쟁은 선순환과 동시에 악순환을 만들어 낸다. &lt;strong&gt;네트워크 효과는 승자에게 강력한 이점을 제공하는 동시에, 패배한 네트워크에는 강력한 부정적인 영향을 미친다. 네트워크의 가치는 사용자가 많아질수록 기하급수적으로 증가하지만, 반대로 사용자가 이탈하면 네트워크의 가치도 기하급수적으로 붕괴한다.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;유저 획득(Acquisition) – 바이럴 성장(viral growth)이 둔화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자 참여(Engagement) – 사용자 활동 감소&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;경제성(Economics) – 수익화(monitization) 악화&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;즉, 네트워크 효과는 강력한 성장 촉진제지만, 동시에 사용자 이탈이 발생하면 네트워크 전체를 급격히 무너뜨리는 요인이 될 수도 있다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;재밌었던-이야기들&quot;&gt;재밌었던 이야기들&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;여기까지가 책 전체에 나온 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 대한 정리다. 여기부터는 콜드 스타트 &amp;amp; 네트워크 효과에 대한 흥미로웠던 이야기들을 정리해놓았다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;알리-임계값-allee-threshold&quot;&gt;알리 임계값 Allee Threshold:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;미어캣은 아프리카 남부에 사는 극도로 사회적인 동물로, 보통 서른에서 쉰 마리 정도가 모여 무리를 지어 생활한다. 그 이유는 포식자가 접근하면 무리 중 한 마리가 두 발로 서서 경계를 서고 복잡한 경고음을 내어 다른 개체들에게 위험을 알리기 때문이다. 이들은 포식자가 공중인지 지상인지, 위험도가 낮은지, 중간인지, 높은지에 따라 다양한 방식으로 짖거나 휘파람 소리를 낸다. 이러한 경고 시스템 덕분에 무리는 안전을 유지할 수 있다. 이러한 동물의 집단 행동은 1930년대 시카고 대학교의 생태학자 워더 클라이드 알리(Warder Clyde Allee)에 의해 처음으로 연구되었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그는 논문 &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400610202&quot;&gt;동물 집단 연구: 금붕어의 콜로이드 은에 대한 집단 보호(Studies in Animal Aggregations: Mass Protection Against Colloidal Silver Among Goldfishes)&lt;/a&gt;를 통해 흥미로운 사실을 발견했다. 그에 따르면, 금붕어는 집단으로 있을 때 더 빠르게 성장하고, 물의 독성을 더 잘 견딜 수 있다. 이러한 개념은 생물학에서 중요한 개념이 되었으며, 집단 크기가 임계점을 넘어야 개체들이 더 안전해지고, 결국 개체군이 더 빠르게 성장할 수 있다는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;알리 임계값(Allee Threshold)&lt;/code&gt; 개념이 탄생했다. 즉, 알리의 인구 성장 곡선은 생태학적 네트워크 효과(Network Effect)와 유사하다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/allee-threshold.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allee Threshold&quot; title=&quot;Allee Threshold&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;메시징 앱을 사용하는 사람이 적으면, 기존 사용자도 앱을 삭제한다:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자 수가 줄어들면, 네트워크의 가치가 감소 → 점점 더 많은 사람들이 앱을 떠남 → 네트워크 붕괴&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;반면, 건강한 미어캣 무리는 지속적으로 성장하며 새로운 무리를 형성할 가능성이 있다:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;알리 임계값을 넘어서면 개체군은 지속적으로 증가&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;충분한 개체 수가 유지되는 한, 약간의 개체 손실이 있어도 전체 인구는 안정적으로 유지&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하지만 이러한 성장은 영원히 지속될 수 없다. 결국, 환경이 제공할 수 있는 자원의 한계(예: 미어캣이 먹는 곤충과 과일의 양) 때문에 개체군이 어느 정도 이상으로 증가할 수 없다. 이것을 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext

서비스 이탈 → 운전자도 플랫폼 이탈 → 우버 네트워크 붕괴&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하지만 임계점을 넘어서면, 네트워크가 원활하게 작동한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;운전자가 증가 → 대기 시간이 감소 → 사용자 증가 → 운전자 증가&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그러나 네트워크가 너무 커지면 한계에 도달한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기다림 없이 차량을 이용하는 것은 편리하지만, 운전자가 너무 많으면 오히려 플랫폼 운영이 비효율적&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;즉, &lt;strong&gt;네트워크가 성장하는 데는 적절한 균형점이 필요&lt;/strong&gt;하다. 알리 임계값은 단순한 생태학 개념이 아니라, 기술 제품의 네트워크 효과에도 그대로 적용된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기에는 임계값을 넘을 수 있도록 사용자 확보가 필수적이다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 성장하면 최적의 수용력을 유지해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;그렇지 않으면 네트워크는 붕괴할 가능성이 크다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크 기반 제품이 성공하려면, 이러한 생태학적 법칙을 이해하고 적절한 성장 전략을 적용해야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;수익성-부족에-대한-이야기&quot;&gt;수익성 부족에 대한 이야기:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;티핑 포인트를 빠르게 거쳐가기 위해 수익이 나지 않는 것이 현명한 이유는 무엇일까? 수익성 부족이 네트워크가 티핑 포인트를 더 빠르게 지나게 하는 현명한 전략이 될 수 있는 이유를 다음과 같이 설명했다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;소수의 원자 네트워크를 구축한 후에는 돈을 지출하여 전체 시장에 진입하고 싶어질 것이다. 마켓플레이스의 경우, 구매자에게는 낮은 가격, 판매자에게는 높은 수익이 핵심적인 가치 제안이 된다. 사회적 제품에서도 마찬가지로, 커뮤니케이션이든 콘텐츠 공유든 중요한 요소가 된다. 여기서 콘텐츠 창작자에게 중요한 것은 청중 확보와 수익 창출 모두다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;일단 시장에서 승리하면, 거의 언제나 규모에 맞게 인센티브를 줄이는 것이 목표가 된다. 플랫폼에서 처리 가능한 전체 시장이 활성화되면, 더 이상 구매 비용에 지출할 필요가 없어진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;단기간에는 수익이 나지 않을 것 같아도, 시장이 내게 유리한 티핑 포인트에 도달한다면 장기적으로 우위를 점할 수 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;인접-사용자-이론-adjacent-users-theory&quot;&gt;인접 사용자 이론 Adjacent Users Theory:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n

네트워크보다 훨씬 더 활성화되어 있다. 일반적으로, 가장 먼저 형성된 핵심 네트워크(Core Network)가 가장 건강하고 활발하게 작동한다. 그러나 핵심 네트워크에서 멀어질수록 참여도가 낮은 사용자 그룹과 거의 활성화되지 않은 네트워크가 존재하게 된다. 즉, 제품을 인지하고 있으며 테스트해본 경험은 있지만, 여전히 참여형 사용자가 되지 못한 이들이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, eBay의 초기 핵심 시장은 미국의 수집품(Collectibles) 커뮤니티였지만, 자동차 같은 고가품을 거래하는 사용자들에게는 적합하지 않았다. 또한, 결제 시스템이 원활하지 않은 국제 시장과 같은 완전히 비활성화된 네트워크도 존재했다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이러한 인접 네트워크(Adjacent Networks)를 이해하고 하나씩 공략하는 것이 성장과 시장 확장의 핵심 전략이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;책에 나온 Instagram 사례:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었음. 이는 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있음. 당시 Instagram의 VP Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 이유를 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발해 10억 명 이상의 사용자로 확장할 수 있도록 만듦.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만, 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었다. 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;당시 Instagram의 VP of Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 원인을 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발하여 사용자를 10억 명 이상으로 확장할 수 있도록 만들었다. 이 때 그가 접근한 방식은 인접 사용자(Adjacent User)에 대한 분석이었다. 이들이 제품을 정착하지 못한 이유는 현재 제품의 포지셔닝 이나 사용자 경험이 이들에게 적합하지 않기 때문이었다. 4억 명의 기존 사용자들에게는 Product-Market Fit이 있었지만, 수십억 명의 새로운 사용자들은 Instagram을 자신의 삶과 연결하지 못하고 있었음.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 인접 사용자는 미국의 35~45세 여성으로, Facebook은 사용하지만 Instagram의 가치를 이해하지 못하는 그룹. 이들을 위해 Facebook 프로필과 친구 관계 데이터를 활용하여 친구 및 가족을 쉽게 찾을 수 있도록 추천 알고리즘을 개선함.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;후기 인접 사용자는 자카르타에서 저사양 3G 안드로이드폰을 사용하는 예비 사용자. 이들을 위해 낮은 데이터 소비를 지원하는 앱 최적화 작업을 진행함.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Instagram은 총 8개의 주요 인접 사용자 그룹을 단계적으로 해결해 나가면서, 성장 정체를 극복하고 폭발적인 확장을 이루어냄.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;컨텍스트의-붕괴-context-collapse&quot;&gt;컨텍스트의 붕괴 Context Collapse:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;모든 네트워크는 초기에 특정 원자 네트워크(Atomic Network)를 중심으로 형성된다. 이 시기에는 네티켓(Netiquette), 즉 네트워크 내에서 허용되는 행동과 금기사항이 자연스럽게 정해지며, 특정 문화가 형성된다. 그러나 시간이 지나면서 이러한 문화는 점점 약화되기 쉬워지고, 결국 맥락 붕괴(Context Collapse)가 발생한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이러한 컨텍스트 붕괴는 서로 다른 사용자 그룹이 하나의 네트워크에서 충돌할 때 발생한다. 예를 들어, Facebook이 초기에는 친한 친구들끼리 사적인 이야기, 사진, 농담을 공유하는 공간으로 활용되었지만, 시간이 지나면서 친척, 가족, 선생님, 상사까지 유입되었다. 이로 인해 사용자는 콘텐츠를 자유롭게 게시하지 못하게 되고, 활동이 줄어들면서 네트워크 성장에도 부정적인 영향을 미치게 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴는 너무나도 많은 네트워크가 동시에 모였을 때 발생한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴의 문제점:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;콘텐츠 제작자(Content Creators) 감소 → 새로운 콘텐츠 감소 → 네트워크 가치 하락\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: YouTube, Instagram의 크리에이터들이 특정 콘텐츠를 올리기 꺼려하는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;마켓플레이스에서의 매칭(Matchmaking) 저하 → 일반 사용자 유입(퀄리티 저하) → 초기 핵심 유저의 이탈 → 네트워크 가치 하락\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: 고급 스니커 거래 커뮤니티가 시간이 지나면서 일반 신발 판매 시장으로 변질되는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기업 내 협업 도구에서의 문제\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;초기: 소규모 팀 내에서는 자유로운 소통이 가능&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;변화: 조직이 커지면서 상사, 임원, 외부 팀까지 유입되며 소통 위축&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: Slack에서 팀원이 자유롭게 농담을 주고받다가 임원이 참여하면서 분위기가 달라지는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴를 극복하는 방법:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자를 세분화(Segmentation)하여 네트워크 분리\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Facebook: 비공개 그룹(Facebook Groups)

Personalization)\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;사용자가 누구에게 어떤 콘텐츠를 노출할지 선택할 수 있도록 지원&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예: Twitter의 “Following” vs. “For You” 피드, LinkedIn의 “Private Mode”&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 사용자 문화 보호\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Airbnb;  “고유한 숙소” 강조하며 호텔과 차별화&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Reddit; 특정 커뮤니티 문화 유지하도록 강력한 모더레이션 정책 운영&lt;/li&gt;\n

&lt;li&gt;대규모 론칭으로 인해 생성된 네트워크가 취약한 이유는 분명하다. 존재하지 않는 다수의 네트워크보다, 밀도가 높고 참여도가 높은 소규모 원자 네트워크가 더 유리하다. 네트워크 제품의 유용성이 다른 사용자의 확보에 달려 있다면, 목표 수치에 집착하기보다 네트워크 내 개별 사용자 간의 관계를 확장하는 것이 더 중요하다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;스타트업은 작은 규모에서 시작하여 네트워크의 힘을 활용해 성장할 수 있는 장점이 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;거대한 규모의 네트워크 효과를 창출하려면, 우선 작은 규모의 원자 네트워크에서 시작해야 한다. 그리고 첫 번째 네트워크 집합에서의 성공을 발판 삼아, 그다음 네트워크 집합으로 확장해 나가야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;마치며&quot;&gt;마치며&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예나 지금이나 스타트업의 성공과 실패 이야기를 들으면 설렘이 가득합니다. 그런데 제품을 만드는 사람으로서, 때로는 엔드 유저로서 네트워크 효과를 가진 서비스를 체험하면서 이 책에서 다루는 내용이 당연하게 느껴지기도 했습니다. 아마도 우리가 이미 경험하고 있는 현상들을 이 책이 체계적으로 정리해주어서 그런것 같습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;각 분야의 전문가들은 특정 문제나 현상을 설명하기 위해 개념에 이름을 붙이곤 합니다. Cold Start Theory, Network Effects, Adjacent Users Theory 등 우리가 이미 알고 있고 경험한 것들을 이 분야의 전문가들이 명명해놓으니, 현상에 대한 이해가 한결 쉬워졌습니다. 이 책을 읽으며 제품을 사용해보고 때로는 만들면서 배웠던 것들을 프레임워크를 통해 정리할 수 있는 좋은 기회가 되었습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;최근 1~2년 동안 회사에서 사용자와 거리가 먼 기술 중심의 업무를 하다 보니, 제품을 바라보는 시각이 점점 무뎌지고 있다는 걸 종종 느꼈습니다. 그럴 때마다 사용자의 목소리를 듣기 위해 고객 문의 채널을 살펴보거나 데이터를 분석하는 일을 틈틈이 해왔던 것 같아요. 그런데 마침 이 책이 그 갈증을 해소해 주었고, 읽는 내내 우리 제품에 빗대어 생각하며 다양한 영감을 얻을 수 있었습니다. 책을 읽으며 들었던 생각을 동료들과 나누며 발산 할 수 있는 기회도 되었습니다. 제로 단계에서 어떤 실패와 성공을 거쳐 글로벌 네트워크를 구축했는지를 다룬 책이니, 꼭 사용자 간 연결을 기반으로 한 제품을 만들지 않더라도 제품 성장에 대한 영감을 얻고 싶다면 일독을 권합니다.

Provider ↔ Consumer, Content Creator ↔ Consumer, Driver ↔ Passenger, Male ↔ Female 처럼 말이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, Uber에서는 운전 기사가 있어야 승객이 있고, Tinder에서는 여성 사용자가 있어야 남성 사용자가 있다. 이처럼 초기 원자 네트워크에는 특정한 역학 관계가 작용한다. 또한, 소수의 사용자가 지나치게 많은 가치를 창출하면서 강력한 권력을 차지하게 되는 현상도 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Uber: 상위 20% 드라이버가 전체 60% 승객을 태운다.</li>\n  <li>Tinder: 여성은 5%의 남성을 선택하지만 평균 남성은 45% 여성을 선택한다.</li>\n  <li>Wikipedia: 전체 사용자는 수억명, 월 활성 작성자가 10만명이지만, 100건 이상 글 편집자는 4,000명(0.02%). Steven Pruitt 라는 한 개인은 영문 위키피디아의 1/3을 작성함(35,000개 글, 300만번 이상 수정).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크 내의 유저는 보통 한 쪽이 다른 한 쪽보다 데려오기 어렵다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>소셜 네트워크: 모두가 소비하는 미디어를 만드는 콘텐츠 창작자</li>\n  <li>앱스토어: 제품을 제작하는 개발자</li>\n  <li>업무용 앱: 문서와 프로젝트를 작성하고 제작하며 동료들을 불러 모으는 관리자</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>그리고 이걸 네트워크의 <strong>하드 사이드(Hard Side)</strong>라고 부른다. 네트워크의 하드 사이드를 관리하고 이들을 만족시키는 것이 원자 네트워크보다 더 중요하다. 따라서 제품이 네트워크 기반으로 성장 하기를 원한다면, 하드 사이드부터 정의하는 것이 중요하다. Uber 와 Tinder도 마찬가지다. 위키피디아 사례를 보면, 고작 0.02%에 불과한 의욕 넘치는 사용자들이 나머지 네트워크를 위해 콘텐츠를 발행한다. 위키피디아의 콘텐츠 창작자들 역시 커뮤니티 자체에 매료되었을 가능성이 높다. 사회적 반응과 지위 등 커뮤니티의 역학 관계가 그들이 계속 콘텐츠를 발행하도록 동기를 부여하는 요소가 된다.</p>\n\n<p>하드 사이드를 정의하고 원자 네트워크를 구축하다 보면 마법의 순간(Magic Moment)이 온다. 여기서는 클럽하우스를 예시로 들었는데, 네트워크가 충분히 채워지고 활성화되어 사람들이 올바른 방식으로 소통할 수 있다면, 그때 Magic Moment가 온다고 한다. 흔히 Magic Moment를 찾는 과정을 Product-Market Fit을 찾는 과정이라고 한다. 그렇다면 Magic Moment를 어떻게 측정할 수 있을까? 이는 반대로 접근해 보면 된다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>예시) 우버 ZERO: 승객이 우버 앱을 실행하여 주소를 선택한 후 승차하기로 했을 때 그 지역에 운전기사가 아무도 없는 상황. 네트워크에 있는 다른 사용자들과 상호작용하는 것이 그 상품의 핵심이라면 제로는 그것이 충족될 수 없다는 의미이며, 이는 사용자가 이탈하여 다시는 돌아오지 않을 수도 있다는 뜻이다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>만약 콜드 스타트 문제를 겪고 있다면, 초기 단계에서는 제품에서 빠진 기능을 인간의 노력으로 대체하는 것도 중요하다. 이 책에서는 이를 플린트스토닝(Flintstoning)이라고 표현한다. 초기 네트워크가 형성되면, 플린트스토닝 기법은 가속도를 얻으며 점점 자동화를 향해 진화한다. 네트워크가 스스로 일어설 수 있을 때까지, 중요한 부분을 수동으로 채워 넣는 것이 목표다.</p>\n\n<p>마지막으로 Always Be Hustlin. 2012년, Uber는 앱에 등장하는 ‘ICE CREAM’ 버튼을 누르면 우버 블랙 차량을 통해 아이스크림이 배달되는 이벤트를 진행했다. ‘실제로 도움이 되었나요?’라는 질문에 대한 대답은 이렇다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>개별적인 볼거리로는 회사에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았을 수도 있다. 하지만 시장을 제로에서 티핑 포인트까지 끌어올리는 프레임워크 안에서, 이러한 재빠르고 영리한 전술은 시장이 이륙하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했다고 생각한다. 가장 중요한 것은, 우버가 이런 개념을 빠르게 식별하고 실행하며 반복할 수 있는 시스템을 만들었다는 점이다. 이러한 시스템을 구축하는 데 도움을 준 것은 <strong>진취적인 팀 문화, 강력한 소프트웨어 제작 도구, 그리고 각 도시마다 고유한 콜드 스타트 문제가 있다는 것에 대한 이해</strong>다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>차량 공유 앱에서 아이스크림을 배달해준다? 이벤트만 보면 서비스 성장에 전혀 영향을 미칠것 같지 않다. 그런데 이런 이벤트들은 Uber 1.0 Cultural Values에 기반한 것이고 이걸 보니 정말 많은 시도를 했겠다는 생각이 들었다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Make Magic</strong>: Seek breakthrough that will stand the test of time</li>\n  <li><strong>Super pumped</strong>: The world is a puzzle to be solved with enthusiasm</li>\n  <li><strong>Inside Out</strong>: Find the gap between popular perception and reality</li>\n  <li><strong>Be an Owner, Not a Renter</strong>: Revolutions are won by true believers</li>\n  <li><strong>Optimistic Leadership</strong>: Be inspiring</li>\n  <li><strong>Be Yourself</strong>: Each of us should be authentic</li>\n  <li><strong>Big Bold Bets</strong>: Take risks and plant seeds that are five to ten years out</li>\n  <li><strong>Customer Obsession</strong>: Start with what’s best for the customer</li>\n  <li><strong>Always Be Hustlin’</strong>: Get more done with less, working longer, harder, and smarter, not just two out of three</li>\n  <li><strong>Let Builders Build</strong>: People must be empowered to build things</li>\n  <li><strong>Winning</strong>: Champion’s Mindset</li>\n  <li><strong>Principled Confrontation</strong>: Sometimes the world and institutions need to change in order for the future to be ushered in</li>\n  <li><strong>Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping</strong>: The best idea always wins.

본격적으로 시작된다. 그리고 경쟁자를 물리치기 위한 네트워크 효과가 발동한다. 재미있는 점은, 여기서 경쟁은 단순히 더 좋은 기능이나 실행력에 관한 것만이 아니라, 한 제품의 생태계가 다른 제품의 생태계를 어떻게 위협하는가에 대한 문제로 확장된다는 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, Airbnb가 시장에서 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달하면, 콜드 스타트 문제(Cold Start Problem)는 새로운 진입자에 대한 방어책이 된다. 결국, 도시에 진입하는 경쟁 제품은 모두 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하여 동일한 밀도를 구축해야 한다. 여러분이 0에서 티핑 포인트(Tipping Point)까지 가는 데 어려움을 겪었던 것처럼, 불리한 조건에서 시작하는 경쟁 업체에게는 더욱 큰 도전이 될

이야기들</h1>\n\n<p>여기까지가 책 전체에 나온 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 대한 정리다. 여기부터는 콜드 스타트 &amp; 네트워크 효과에 대한 흥미로웠던 이야기들을 정리해놓았다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"알리-임계값-allee-threshold\">알리 임계값 Allee Threshold:</h3>\n\n<p>미어캣은 아프리카 남부에 사는 극도로 사회적인 동물로, 보통 서른에서 쉰 마리 정도가 모여 무리를 지어 생활한다. 그 이유는 포식자가 접근하면 무리 중 한 마리가 두 발로 서서 경계를 서고 복잡한 경고음을 내어 다른 개체들에게 위험을 알리기 때문이다. 이들은 포식자가 공중인지 지상인지, 위험도가 낮은지, 중간인지, 높은지에 따라 다양한 방식으로 짖거나 휘파람 소리를 낸다. 이러한 경고 시스템 덕분에 무리는 안전을 유지할 수 있다. 이러한 동물의 집단 행동은 1930년대 시카고 대학교의 생태학자 워더 클라이드 알리(Warder Clyde Allee)에 의해 처음으로 연구되었다.</p>\n\n<p>그는 논문 <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400610202\">동물 집단 연구: 금붕어의 콜로이드 은에 대한 집단 보호(Studies in Animal Aggregations: Mass Protection Against Colloidal Silver Among Goldfishes)</a>를 통해 흥미로운 사실을 발견했다. 그에 따르면, 금붕어는 집단으로 있을 때 더 빠르게 성장하고, 물의 독성을 더 잘 견딜 수 있다. 이러한 개념은 생물학에서 중요한 개념이 되었으며, 집단 크기가 임계점을 넘어야 개체들이 더 안전해지고, 결국 개체군이 더 빠르게 성장할 수 있다는 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">알리 임계값(Allee Threshold)</code> 개념이 탄생했다. 즉, 알리의 인구 성장 곡선은 생태학적 네트워크 효과(Network Effect)와 유사하다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2025/01/30/allee-threshold.png\" alt=\"Allee Threshold\" title=\"Allee Threshold\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>메시징 앱을 사용하는 사람이 적으면, 기존 사용자도 앱을 삭제한다:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>사용자 수가 줄어들면, 네트워크의 가치가 감소 → 점점 더 많은 사람들이 앱을 떠남 → 네트워크 붕괴</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>반면, 건강한 미어캣 무리는 지속적으로 성장하며 새로운 무리를 형성할 가능성이 있다:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>알리 임계값을 넘어서면 개체군은 지속적으로 증가</li>\n  <li>충분한 개체 수가 유지되는 한, 약간의 개체 손실이 있어도 전체 인구는 안정적으로 유지</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>하지만 이러한 성장은 영원히 지속될 수 없다. 결국, 환경이 제공할 수 있는 자원의 한계(예: 미어캣이 먹는 곤충과 과일의 양) 때문에 개체군이 어느 정도 이상으로 증가할 수 없다. 이것을 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">수용력(Carrying Capacity)</code>이라고 한다.</p>\n\n<p>우버(Uber)와 알리 곡선(Allee Curve) 예시:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>도시 내에 운전자가 감소 → 차량 호출 시간이 길어짐 → 사용자 서비스 이탈 → 운전자도 플랫폼 이탈 → 우버 네트워크 붕괴</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>하지만 임계점을 넘어서면, 네트워크가 원활하게 작동한다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>운전자가 증가 → 대기 시간이 감소 → 사용자 증가 → 운전자 증가</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>그러나 네트워크가 너무 커지면 한계에 도달한다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>기다림 없이 차량을 이용하는 것은 편리하지만, 운전자가 너무 많으면 오히려 플랫폼 운영이 비효율적</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>즉, <strong>네트워크가 성장하는 데는 적절한 균형점이 필요</strong>하다. 알리 임계값은 단순한 생태학 개념이 아니라, 기술 제품의 네트워크 효과에도 그대로 적용된다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>초기에는 임계값을 넘을 수 있도록 사용자 확보가 필수적이다.</li>\n  <li>네트워크가 성장하면 최적의 수용력을 유지해야 한다.</li>\n  <li>그렇지 않으면 네트워크는 붕괴할 가능성이 크다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크 기반 제품이 성공하려면, 이러한 생태학적 법칙을 이해하고 적절한 성장 전략을 적용해야 한다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"수익성-부족에-대한-이야기\">수익성 부족에 대한 이야기:</h3>\n\n<p>티핑 포인트를 빠르게 거쳐가기 위해 수익이 나지 않는 것이 현명한 이유는 무엇일까? 수익성 부족이 네트워크가 티핑 포인트를 더 빠르게 지나게 하는 현명한 전략이 될 수 있는 이유를 다음과 같이 설명했다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>소수의 원자 네트워크를 구축한 후에는 돈을 지출하여 전체 시장에 진입하고 싶어질 것이다. 마켓플레이스의 경우, 구매자에게는 낮은 가격, 판매자에게는 높은 수익이 핵심적인 가치 제안이 된다. 사회적 제품에서도 마찬가지로, 커뮤니케이션이든 콘텐츠 공유든 중요한 요소가 된다. 여기서 콘텐츠 창작자에게 중요한 것은 청중 확보와 수익 창출 모두다.</li>\n  <li>일단 시장에서 승리하면, 거의 언제나 규모에 맞게 인센티브를 줄이는 것이 목표가 된다. 플랫폼에서 처리 가능한 전체 시장이 활성화되면, 더 이상 구매 비용에 지출할 필요가 없어진다.</li>\n  <li>단기간에는 수익이 나지 않을 것 같아도, 시장이 내게 유리한 티핑 포인트에 도달한다면 장기적으로 우위를 점할 수 있다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"인접-사용자-이론-adjacent-users-theory\">인접 사용자 이론 Adjacent Users Theory:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://andrewchen.com/the-adjacent-user-theory/\">The Adjacent User Theory</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크는 여러 개의 작은 네트워크로 이루어져 있으며, 일부 네트워크는 다른 네트워크보다 훨씬 더 활성화되어 있다. 일반적으로, 가장 먼저 형성된 핵심 네트워크(Core Network)가 가장 건강하고 활발하게 작동한다. 그러나 핵심 네트워크에서 멀어질수록 참여도가 낮은 사용자 그룹과 거의 활성화되지 않은 네트워크가 존재하게 된다. 즉, 제품을 인지하고 있으며 테스트해본 경험은 있지만, 여전히 참여형 사용자가 되지 못한 이들이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, eBay의 초기 핵심 시장은 미국의 수집품(Collectibles) 커뮤니티였지만, 자동차 같은 고가품을 거래하는 사용자들에게는 적합하지 않았다. 또한, 결제 시스템이 원활하지 않은 국제 시장과 같은 완전히 비활성화된 네트워크도 존재했다.</p>\n\n<p>이러한 인접 네트워크(Adjacent Networks)를 이해하고 하나씩 공략하는 것이 성장과 시장 확장의 핵심 전략이다.</p>\n\n<p>책에 나온 Instagram 사례:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었음. 이는 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있음. 당시 Instagram의 VP Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 이유를 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발해 10억 명 이상의 사용자로 확장할 수 있도록 만듦.</li>\n  <li>2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만, 성장이

새로운 사용자들은 Instagram을 자신의 삶과 연결하지 못하고 있었음.</li>\n  <li>초기 인접 사용자는 미국의 35~45세 여성으로, Facebook은 사용하지만 Instagram의 가치를 이해하지 못하는 그룹. 이들을 위해 Facebook 프로필과 친구 관계 데이터를 활용하여 친구 및 가족을 쉽게 찾을 수 있도록 추천 알고리즘을 개선함.</li>\n  <li>후기 인접 사용자는 자카르타에서 저사양 3G 안드로이드폰을 사용하는 예비 사용자. 이들을 위해 낮은 데이터 소비를 지원하는 앱 최적화 작업을 진행함.</li>\n  <li>Instagram은 총 8개의 주요 인접 사용자 그룹을 단계적으로 해결해 나가면서, 성장 정체를 극복하고 폭발적인 확장을

자연스럽게 정해지며, 특정 문화가 형성된다. 그러나 시간이 지나면서 이러한 문화는 점점 약화되기 쉬워지고, 결국 맥락 붕괴(Context Collapse)가 발생한다.</p>\n\n<p>이러한 컨텍스트 붕괴는 서로 다른 사용자 그룹이 하나의 네트워크에서 충돌할 때 발생한다. 예를 들어, Facebook이 초기에는 친한 친구들끼리 사적인 이야기, 사진, 농담을 공유하는 공간으로 활용되었지만, 시간이 지나면서 친척, 가족, 선생님, 상사까지 유입되었다. 이로 인해 사용자는 콘텐츠를 자유롭게 게시하지 못하게 되고, 활동이 줄어들면서 네트워크 성장에도 부정적인 영향을 미치게 된다.</p>\n\n<p>컨텍스트 붕괴는 너무나도 많은 네트워크가 동시에 모였을 때 발생한다.</p>\n\n<p>컨텍스트 붕괴의

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 BigQuery 환경에서 dbt 사용법에 대해 작성한 글입니다\n예상 독자\n    \nBigQuery에서 dbt를 사용하는 방법에 궁금하신 분\n앞선 dbt 사용법과 기본 개념 글을 읽으신 분\n키워드 : dbt BigQuery, \bdbt modeling\ndbt + BigQuery를 위한 환경 설정\ndbt bigquery 설치\ndbt-core는 설치했다고 가정하고 dbt-bigquery를 설치\n\npip3 install dbt-bigquery\n\n\ndbt init\n\ndbt init newyork_taxi\n\n\n위 명령어를 입력하면 DB를 선택하는 부분이 나옴. BigQuery로 설정\n만약 Runtime Error(No adapters available)이 발생하면 위에 dbt-bigquery를 설치해야 함(DB와 연결하는 라이브러리가 설치되어 있지 않다는 의미)\n권한 설정을 어떻게 할지 물어보는 질문도 있는데, oauth와 service_account가 존재\n    \n여기선 oauth로 진행. 로컬 개발할 때는 oauth도 추천\n회사였으면 service_account로 설정\n        \ndbt로 만든 것을 주기적으로 실행할 때는 service_account를 발급해서 GitHub Actions나 Airflow에 설정해줘야 하지만, 지금은 로컬 개발에 집중\n프로젝트 ID, 데이터셋, threads, timeout seconds, region을 입력\n\n~/.dbt/profiles.yml을 확인하면, 방금 입력한 내용을 확인할 수 있음\n\ncat ~/.dbt/profiles.yml\n\n\n\nnewyork_taxi:\n  outputs:\n    dev:\n      dataset: newyork_taxi\n      job_execution_timeout_seconds: 300\n

옮기려면 아래 명령어 실행(홈 디렉토리 안에 프로필 파일이 있는데, 회사에서 작업한다면 이런 프로필을 GitHub Repository에 넣고 Push)\n    \ndbt_project.yml : 프로젝트 설정 파일. 프로젝트 구조, 리소스 설정, 변수 등\nprofiles.yml : 프로필 설정 파일. 데이터베이스 연결 정보 등이 저장됨\n\ncp ~/.dbt/profiles.yml .\n\n\ngcloud를 사용해 oauth\n터미널에서 아래 명령어 입력(gcloud 사전에 설치되어야 함)\n    \ngcloud 설치 방법은 Docs 참고\n\ngcloud auth application-default login \\\n  --scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/bigquery,\\\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly,\\\nhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam.test\n\n\ndbt run\n샘플 모델을 실행\n    \nmodels/example 폴더에 있는 my_first_dbt_model.sql, my_second_dbt_model.sql가 실행됨\n\ndbt run\n\n\n실행하면 BigQuery에 새로운 테이블, 뷰가 추가됨\n\ndbt utils 설정\ndbt_utils는 dbt에서 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 macro와 Test를 모아둔 패키지\npackages.yml 파일에 dbt_utils 패키지를 추가(이 파일이 없다면 생성하고 추가하면 됨)\n\npackages:\n  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils\n    version: 1.3.0\n\n\n그 후, dbt deps를 실행해 디펜던시를 설치함\n\n\n사용할 데이터\nBigQuery의 Public Data인 뉴욕 택시 데이터인 tlc_green_trips_2022 테이블을 사용\nSource 데이터 설정\n    \nmodels/sources.yml에 소스 데이터를 설정해서, dbt 모델링을 할 때 사용할 수 있음\nBigQuery Public 데이터인 tlc_green_trips_2022을 사용할 예정이나, 이 테이블은 파티션 설정이 되어있지 않아 전체를 복사한 후 파티션을 설정할 예정\n\ntlc_green_trips_2022 테이블 파티션 설정\n아래 쿼리를 실행해 Public이 아닌 자신의 프로젝트의 데이터셋에 저장\n\nCREATE OR REPLACE TABLE newyork_taxi.tlc_green_trips_2022\nPARTITION BY DATE(pickup_datetime)\nCLUSTER BY pickup_location_id, dropoff_location_id\nAS\nSELECT *\nFROM bigquery-public-data.new_york_taxi_trips.tlc_green_trips_2022;\n\n\n테이블 정보 저장\nmodels/sources.yml에 다음과 같이 저장\n    \n처음에 헷갈릴 수 있는 부분은, database, schema, tables 개념인데 핵심만 정리하면 다음과 같음\n        \ndatabase는 구글 클라우드 프로젝트 ID\nschema는 빅쿼리 데이터셋\ntables의 name은 테이블 이름\ntests 부분은 임의로 추가함. 실제로 잘 통과되는 test도 있고, 통과되지 않을 test도 존재\n\nversion:
