        "content:encodedSnippet": "ExecuTorch is the PyTorch inference framework for edge devices developed by Meta with support from industry leaders like Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm. \nRunning machine learning (ML) models on-device is increasingly important for Meta’s family of apps (FoA). These on-device models improve latency, maintain user privacy by keeping data on users’ devices, and enable offline functionality.\nWe’re showcasing some of the on-device AI features, powered by ExecuTorch, that are serving billions of people on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook.\nThese rollouts have significantly improved the performance and efficiency of on-device ML models in Meta’s FoA and eased the research to production path.\nOver the past year, we’ve rolled out ExecuTorch, an open-source solution for on-device inference on mobile and edge devices, across our family of apps (FoA) and seen significant improvements in model performance, privacy enhancement, and latency over our previous on-device machine learning (ML) stack.\nExecuTorch was built in collaboration with industry leaders and uses PyTorch 2.x technologies to convert models into a stable and compact representation for efficient on-device deployment. Its compact runtime, modularity, and extensibility make it easy for developers to choose and customize components – ensuring portability across platforms, compatibility with PyTorch, and high performance.\nAdopting ExecuTorch has helped us enhance our user experiences in our products and services used by billions of people all over the world.\nThe following are just a few examples of the various ML models on our apps on Android and iOS devices that ExecuTorch supports.\nEnabling Cutouts on Instagram\nCutouts is one of Instagram’s latest features for creative expression and storytelling. It lets people transform photos and videos of their favorite moments into animated, personalized stickers that they can share via Reels or Stories. We migrated the Cutouts feature in Instagram to run with ExecuTorch by enabling SqueezeSAM, a lightweight version of the Meta Segment Anything Model (SAM). For both Android and iOS, ExecuTorch was significantly faster compared to the older stack, translating into increases in Cutouts’ daily active users (DAU). \nExecuTorch enables Instagram’s Cutouts feature to run faster and more efficiently for both on-device sticker generation (left) and creating overlays on a photo. (right)\nImproving video and call quality on WhatsApp\nWhatsApp needs to be usable and reliable regardless of your network connection bandwidth. To achieve this, we developed bandwidth estimation models, tailored for various platforms. These models help detect and utilize available network bandwidth, optimizing video streaming quality without compromising the smoothness of video calls.  \nThese models need to be highly accurate and run as efficiently as possible. By leveraging ExecuTorch, we have observed improvements for the bandwidth estimation models in performance, reliability, and efficiency metrics. Specifically, we reduced the model load time and average inference time substantially while reducing app not responsive (ANR) metrics. Along the way, we further strengthened  security guarantees compared to the older PyTorch mobile framework by adding fuzzing tests, which involve supplying invalid or random inputs to a program and monitoring for exceptions. With the positive signal from these releases, we are now migrating several other key WhatsApp models, such as ones for on-device noise-canceling and video enhancement, to ExecuTorch as well. \nHere, Messenger’s language identification model (Lid) restricts the prompt language to English for Meta AI’s Imagine feature.\nShipping on-device ML for end-to-end encryption on Messenger\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Messenger ensures that no one except you and the people you’re talking to can see your messages, not even Meta. ExecuTorch has enabled E2EE on Messenger by moving server side models to run on-device, allowing data transfers to remain encrypted.\nTo enable E2EE, we migrated and deployed several models, including an on-device language identification (LID) model on Messenger. LID is a Messenger model that detects the language of given text and enables various downstream tasks, including translation, message summarization, and personalized content recommendations. With ExecuTorch, on-device LID is significantly faster and conserves server and network capacity. \nTo preserve Messenger’s E2EE environment, we have also leveraged ExecuTorch to move other Messenger models on-device, including one for optimizing video calling quality (similar to WhatsApp’s bandwidth estimation models) and another for image cutouts (similar to Cutouts on Instagram). These shifts resulted in improved infrastructure efficiency by freeing up capacity and enabling us to scale these features globally. \nBackground music recommendations for Facebook\nFacebook employs a core AI model called SceneX that performs a variety of tasks, including image recognition/categorization, captioning, creating AI-generated backgrounds for images, and image safety checks. Shifting SceneX to ExecuTorch now allows it to enhance people’s Facebook Stories by suggesting background music based on images.\nWith the ExecuTorch rollout, we saw performance improvements in SceneX across the board from low- to high-end devices compared to the older stack. Several other models, including which enhance image quality and perform background noise reduction during calls, are now in various stages of A/B testing. \nBuilding the future of on-device AI with the ExecuTorch Community\nWe hope the results we’ve seen leveraging ExecuTorch to help solve some of Meta’s on-device ML challenges at scale will be encouraging to the rest of the industry. We invite you to contribute to ExecuTorch and share feedback on our GitHub page. You can also join our growing community on the ExecuTorch Discord server.\nWe look forward to driving more innovation in on-device ML and shaping the future of on-device AI together with the community.\nThe post Accelerating on-device ML on Meta’s family of apps with ExecuTorch appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I’ll start by acknowledging that you probably already do.\nAnd honestly? We get it. Programming is hard! Learning materials can be poorly structured and lack good visualizations. Sometimes your teacher is a math genius who is bad at talking. And hey, AI is pretty capable for beginner-level problems. It can make the implementation much faster for some learners, but for others it can actually make everything worse.\nThis post isn’t meant to wag fingers or shame anyone. We just want learners to be smart about the way they use new technology – especially one as impactful on the learning process as LLMs. Indeed, sometimes getting the best learning experience may mean not using AI, but sometimes it just means using it slightly differently.\nThis is part three in our series How to Learn to Code in an AI World. Don’t miss the first, Is it Still Worth Learning to Code?, and second, Learning to Think in an AI World: 5 Lessons for Novice Programmers.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s get right to it: Should you use AI when learning to program?\nOur answer is best expressed as a graph:\n\n\n\n\nIn short, the more of a beginner you are, the less you should use AI to generate code for you. \nThere are a lot of reasons for this, namely:\nSkipping the basics makes understanding harder concepts more difficult.\nYou accept more bad suggestions because your code reading skills are not developed.\nIt speeds you up, which is good for productivity but bad for knowledge retention.\nYou feel less ownership over your work, which decreases motivation.\nThe experience of programming becomes “flatter” – a solution given to you is less satisfying than one you worked for.\nIt messes with your perception of how much you know in the following ways:\n\nYou lose self-confidence and feel like you can’t code without AI assistance\nYou develop delusionally high self-confidence, where you feel like you’re a great programmer, even though AI is doing most of the work, and you barely understand how a for loop works.\nThis doesn’t mean you can’t use AI to help you follow your curiosity and increase your motivation to learn things yourself. You can ask it to generate metaphors for challenging abstract concepts, ask questions if no human teacher is available, clarify terms that confuse you, and even get advice on a personal project that is slightly out of your depth.\nIf positive reinforcement isn’t working, try asking your AI to be mean to you.\n\n\n\nStill, we would generally advise caution when interacting with LLMs that aren’t specifically tailored for education. Research shows people are very bad at realizing when AI is replacing their thinking rather than augmenting it.\nChoosing between no AI, an AI made for learning, or going all in is difficult. In the next part, we’ll go a bit deeper into the pros and cons of each of these options.\nNon-AI materials and tutors\nInconvenient, but better for knowledge retention and accuracy\nNon-AI materials require us to commit to the active process of digging through books, documentation, and forums to find answers. It can take much longer compared to prompting an LLM, but the benefit is that it fully engages us in our own learning (as long as it doesn’t ruin our motivation by being too boring). Our brains interpret the additional time as a sign of importance, which in turn enhances our memory of what we learned. Moreover, we might stumble upon unexpected gems in a way that’s difficult with AI-generated answers.\nLet’s also not overlook the human element here: a skilled teacher can offer a personal perspective that significantly outweighs the convenience of AI. Through good teachers we learn to love a subject and believe in ourselves, profoundly impacting the experience of learning and our long-term motivation.\nTake, for instance, our completely human-made animated guide to Git!\n\n\n\nAI tutors\nExtremely convenient but hard to get right in practice\nUsually, when we interact with AI, we’re looking for a quick and easy answer. Even when it’s engineered to prompt us to do some thinking on our own, we tend to unconsciously skip over those questions and shortcut to the solution. It requires a lot of willpower to slow down and truly digest the information AI gives us, not to mention reflect and relate it to previous things we’ve learned, and finally, understand how to apply it in practice.\nIf you’re good at making yourself slow down and think, then tutor away! But, if you find yourself spending most of your time prompting, skimming, and rushing toward output – skipping the high-level thinking parts of coding – then we’d recommend you take a break from AI and find ways to allow for more thoughtful reflection into your practice.\nAI tutors can help spark your curiosity if you’re having trouble connecting with the material.\n\n\n\nAI assistants\nGreat for doing things, less great for learning things; to use them wisely requires a strong foundation\nThere are as many opinions on the best way to use an AI assistant as there are software developers. Some use it every time they code and some prefer a whiteboard and a rubber duck. Over time you’ll learn your preference and style. The important thing is for you to figure out how to write quality code quickly and in a way that feels good.\nIf you do use it, we definitely recommend spending some focused time learning best practices – like any technology, it takes some intention to learn to use it well. See our course catalog for free courses like Coding with AI assistant or Prompting to debug and fix AI-generated code.\nCode completion should only be used when you’ve developed a strong foundation.\n\n\n\nIn summary, while AI tools are incredibly convenient, it’s crucial for beginners to exercise caution. Overreliance on AI for code generation can hinder foundational understanding, knowledge retention, and intrinsic motivation.\nThe best approach involves balancing AI assistance with traditional learning methods, fostering computational thinking, and staying smart about when you use it. Ultimately, the effectiveness of AI in your coding journey depends on your learning style, current skill level, and how thoughtfully you integrate these powerful tools.\nGet a free student license\n                                                                Explore our course catalog\n                                    \nThis is the third post in our series How to Learn to Program in an AI World.

But here’s the critical truth every developer and team lead should understand: using AI tools is not the same as understanding AI agents. That’s why we created the course AI Agents as Your Team. It’s a hands-on, real-world roadmap to understanding how AI agents actually work—and how you can work with them.\nTake the Course for Free\n                                                    \nIt’s Time to Think Like an AI Agent Collaborator\n2025 is the year software teams go into post-human mode. Every engineer will soon have a few tireless digital teammates running tests, writing patches, and signaling for help only when truly needed.\nAndrew Zakonov, the course creator and AI Product Leader at JetBrains\nAI agents are no longer sci-fi—they’re here. But so is the danger: when we don’t understand how they operate, we treat them like black boxes—trusting them blindly or avoiding them altogether. This course pulls back the curtain, helping you demystify AI agents and move beyond simply observing their outputs.\nYou’ll gain a foundational understanding of:\nHow Agents Are Built: The architecture of LLM-powered agents and how they actually work under the hood.\nMaximizing Productivity: Practical strategies and “playbooks” for potentially achieving a 10x increase with today’s AI agent technology.\nNavigating Risks: The challenges that come with using AI agents and actionable ways to mitigate them, ensuring responsible adoption.\nStaying Ahead: How to navigate the fast-paced AI landscape as new models and agents continue to emerge.\nBuilt by Builders — JetBrains and Nebius\nWhat makes this course stand out isn’t just the curriculum. It’s who built it:\nJetBrains: The team behind IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and now Junie, a deeply context-aware coding agent built for professionals.\nNebius: Experts in scalable, AI-first cloud infrastructure.\nWe’re not just creating AI products, we’re actively contributing to the industry’s growth, awareness and cutting-edge education. Our engineers understand the real stakes of working with intelligent systems—performance, trust, transparency, and productivity. \nThe course reflects that mindset. \nYou’ll see how Junie works and what makes an agent truly useful. It’s the kind of insight that changes how you write code—and how you think about your tools.\nWho Should Enroll\nThis course isn’t just about speeding up tasks; it’s about architecting better workflows, navigating complex AI systems, and building safe, observable co-creators. This is foundational knowledge for anyone who cares about developer experience, AI literacy, or technical leadership.\nTake this course if you:\nFeel AI creeping into your stack and want to stay ahead of the curve.\nAre mentoring devs who need better guidance than “just use ChatGPT.”\nWant to explore agent orchestration, prompt engineering, or agent UIs.\nAre serious about integrating tools like Junie into your production workflow.\nIt’s like getting extra developers to your team! If you spend time now learning how these agents plan, loop through feedback, and expose the handful of decisions that still need you, that time will pay off in every task that follows.\nAndrew Zakonov, the course creator and AI Product Leader at JetBrains\nWhy Now\nThere’s no prize for being first, but there’s a cost to being last. AI Agents as Your Team is free right now, a rare opportunity to gain insights companies typically reserve for private training. If you’re even thinking about working with AI professionally, do yourself a favor and seize this chance while it’s open. We’re recommending it to our teams, and we hope you’ll join us.\nStart Now",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2025/07/introducing-teamcity-recipes/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 31 Jul 2025 12:23:21 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Build steps are often repeated over and over – within a single project or team, or even across a whole organization. These patterns tend to get copy-pasted, manually adapted, and maintained in parallel. This can lead to inconsistencies and extra maintenance work.\nWith the latest TeamCity release, we’re addressing that problem head-on. Say hello to TeamCity recipes: customizable build steps that can be reused, versioned, and published on the JetBrains Marketplace (or used internally in your organization).\nWhether you’re managing dozens of pipelines or just want to save time setting up repeatable build logic, recipes are designed to streamline your CI/CD workflows. Let’s take a closer look at what recipes are about.\nWhat are TeamCity recipes?\nRecipes are build steps you can save and reuse whenever you need to repeat the same setup. They help you avoid reinventing the wheel by letting you define and reuse common build logic.\nTeamCity recipes on JetBrains Marketplace\n\n\n\nRecipes can be:\nPublic, shared on the JetBrains Marketplace.\nPrivate, shared within a specific TeamCity project or organization.\nEach recipe can include configurable parameters, documentation, and versioning, making them easy to integrate and maintain.\nFor more information about what recipes are and how they’re different from meta runners, please refer to our documentation.\nWhat’s new in this release?\nPublic contributions via the JetBrains Marketplace\nFor the first time, external users can publish their own recipes to the JetBrains Marketplace. This opens the door to a community-driven ecosystem of reusable build logic, maintained and shared by TeamCity users around the world.\nTo upload your own recipes to the Marketplace, follow these steps.\nRedesigned recipe installation UI\nOur new interface provides a more user-friendly installation experience:\nView author details and recipe versions.\nInstall specific versions.\nPreview source code before installing.\nExample of a TeamCity recipe\n\n\n\nThis transparency ensures that users can review and trust third-party contributions.\nYAML support for private recipes\nPreviously known as meta runners, private recipes can now be written in YAML. This modern syntax improves readability and maintainability. While XML is still supported for backward compatibility, YAML is now the recommended format.\nUnified UI for recipe management\nManage both public and private recipes from a single interface:\nUpload and organize private recipes at the project level.\nView usage across build configurations and templates (including private recipes).\nDetect outdated or unavailable recipes that could break builds.\n\n\n\n\nWhy use TeamCity recipes?\nWhether you’re reusing steps within your organization or using recipes created within your organization or outside of it, this feature offers a practical way to reduce duplication and simplify maintenance.\nPublic recipes give you access to a growing library of build steps created by the TeamCity community. Because each recipe is a small, self-contained file with visible source code, you can review what it does before using it. \nPrivate recipes, on the other hand, help teams standardize their internal workflows. Written in YAML, they’re easier to read, edit, and debug compared to older XML-based meta runners. And because they’re scoped to your TeamCity project or organization, they stay private and secure.\nBoth public and private recipes are easier to create and share than full-fledged plugins, lowering the barrier to contribution.\nBuilt for safety\nThe idea behind recipes might feel familiar: many CI tools offer reusable build logic. But with TeamCity Recipes, we’ve taken a more opinionated approach to how they’re configured, shared, and executed, focusing strongly on security, transparency, and ease of use.\nUnlike some other ecosystems, TeamCity doesn’t default to using floating versions like latest, which can introduce unintentional changes into your builds. When you install a recipe, you choose a specific version, giving you more control and predictability.\nWhen a new version becomes available, TeamCity will notify you, but won’t auto-upgrade anything without your knowledge and permission.\nEvery public recipe comes with visible source code you can inspect directly from the TeamCity UI before installing and from the overview page after the installation. Once installed, the build step editor automatically adapts to the Recipe’s parameters, presenting clear controls and descriptions instead of relying on manual text input. \nThis makes Recipes not only easier to trust, but also easier to configure and debug, especially for teams that value visibility and safety.\nHow to publish a recipe\nPublishing a recipe is simple:\nLog in to the JetBrains Marketplace.\nChoose “TeamCity Recipes” as the plugin type.\nUpload your recipe with metadata and namespace (to avoid naming collisions). Namespaces allow multiple users to publish recipes with the same name under different scopes.\n\n\n\n\nPlease also refer to our documentation for more information on how to upload a new recipe.\nGive it a try\nRecipes are now live in TeamCity. Browse the Marketplace, experiment with public recipes, or create your own to simplify and supercharge your CI/CD pipelines.\nWe believe this feature will help foster a more vibrant, collaborative TeamCity community, and we can’t wait to see what you build 🚀\nStay tuned for upcoming tutorials and videos showcasing what’s possible with recipes!",

It’s also time-consuming and tedious to manually make fixes. That’s why Qodana’s Quick-Fix feature is designed to go beyond static analysis – it automatically improves your codebase using predefined strategies that fit your team’s needs.\nQuick-Fix is available for Qodana Ultimate and Ultimate Plus license users, and it supports Qodana for JVM, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Go, and .NET linters (including trial versions).\nThree strategies for fixing code faster\nQodana’s Quick-Fix isn’t just a one-size-fits-all solution. It lets you choose from three modes, depending on how aggressive or conservative you want to be:\nNone – No fixes are applied. Use this option if you want reporting only.\nCleanup – This option applies safe, non-invasive cleanup inspections (like removing unused imports, reformatting, etc.) that don’t change logic or behavior.\nApply – This option tries to fix all detected issues, including those that may affect logic or behavior. This is ideal for thorough refactoring, but it requires review before merging.\nThese modes give you fine-grained control over automation, from low-risk cosmetic cleanups to more substantial code rewrites.\nHow to run Quick-Fixes \nYou can enable a Quick-Fix strategy in a few environments:\nLocally via Docker or the Qodana CLI.\n\n\n\n\nIn your CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.\n\n\n\n\nVia configuration using qodana.yaml.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a basic example using Docker with the –apply-fixes flag:\n$ docker run \\\n   -v <source-directory>/:/data/project/  \\\n   -e QODANA_TOKEN=\"<cloud-project-token>\" \\\n   jetbrains/qodana-<linter> \\\n   --apply-fixes\nYou can set your strategy directly in the qodana.yaml file if you’re automating across environments. Find out how to use other Quick-Fix options in our documentation.\nView Documentation\nQodana proposes merging\n\n\n\nWhy it matters\nWhile other tools provide some in-editor suggestions, Qodana goes further with CI-integrated fixes at scale. You can run code inspections nightly or per your requirements, apply fixes automatically, and prevent regressions before they hit the main branch.\nWhen used alongside Qodana Cloud or TeamCity Pipelines, Quick-Fixes provide complete traceability from inspection to remediation, all integrated with your JetBrains IDE experience.\nStop just spotting issues – have control over how you fix them. Qodana’s Quick-Fix brings reliable, automated code improvements directly into your CI workflow.\nTry it out on your next build\nNeed help configuring Cleanup or Apply strategies?

But there’s plenty more under the hood, including network policy controls, usage limits, and a bunch of smaller but useful improvements.\nCursor support\nCursor is one of the fastest-growing IDEs today, built on top of VS Code and deeply integrated with AI tooling. Starting with CodeCanvas 2025.2, developers can use Cursor in their remote dev environments.\nFrom the administrator’s perspective, nothing changes. Cursor uses the same Remote SSH protocol as VS Code. To start using it, simply select Cursor from the list of supported IDEs when creating a dev environment template.\n\nKeep in mind:\nCodeCanvas always uses the latest version of Cursor. You can’t set it to a specific version.\nTo prevent compatibility issues, developers should keep Cursor updated on their machines.\nAll Cursor extensions are installed from the VS Code Marketplace, so existing VS Code plugin setups can usually be reused.\nJupyter notebooks\n\nJupyter is a popular tool for working with data, especially in data science and machine learning. It lets you combine code, output, and documentation in a single notebook interface. Running Jupyter in the cloud is a common need, especially for resource-heavy workloads. With CodeCanvas, this has always been technically possible. But in 2025.2, we’ve made it official.\nWe’ve documented the setup steps and explained how to make Jupyter work smoothly in dev environments.\nJupyter is currently supported only in VS Code.\nYou’ll need to install a few extensions and use life cycle scripts to start the Jupyter server.\nLearn how to set up Jupyter in CodeCanvas\nMore improvements in 2025.2\nBeyond support for Cursor and Jupyter, this release includes many other updates, from cost optimization to security hardening. Here are a few highlights:\nCost control tools\nConcurrent usage limits – You can now cap how many dev environments each user can run at the same time. Usage is tracked per instance type.\nAuto-disabling warm-up and standby pools – Standby pools and scheduled warm-ups are now automatically disabled after repeated failures or prolonged inactivity. This prevents unused resources from consuming capacity and cloud costs.\nBetter security\nNetwork policies – The operator Helm chart now supports configurable network policies. Two built-in policies are enabled by default:\n\nDenying all inbound traffic (including between dev environments)\nAllowing all outbound traffic\nYou can disable or change these policies, or define your own custom network policies to match your infrastructure and security needs.\nOther features\nCodeCanvas 2025.2 has even more to offer: non-root dev containers, per-namespace and per-template usage metrics, and more.\nSee the full list of features\nWhat can CodeCanvas do for your team?\nWant to learn more about the benefits of CDEs and whether they’re right for your organization?

This shift allows us to tackle long-standing issues and improve the overall experience of working with Bazel projects in JetBrains IDEs. As of July 2025, these plugins are no longer offered by, nor affiliated with, Google.\nWhat’s changing\nBazel for CLion: We’re continuing active development of the plugin with a focus on improving stability, addressing performance bottlenecks, and resolving the most common user-reported issues.\nBazel for IntelliJ: The plugin has been deprecated. JetBrains is maintaining it for now solely to keep it compatible with newer IntelliJ IDEA versions, but no new features will be added. The Bazel team has released a new plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, and PyCharm and is actively developing it. Read the blog post to learn more about it: Bazel Plugin Release: General Availability.\nWhat’s new in Bazel for CLion\nStarting with v2025.06.24.0.1, the plugin includes the first batch of improvements, particularly around the Virtual File System (VFS). We’ve started addressing the causes behind frequent Refreshing files dialogs and connection drops during remote development.\nTo ensure these fixes take effect in your IDE, update and then run the File | Invalidate Caches action with the Clear file system cache and Local History option selected.\nWhat’s next\nWe’re prioritizing the following areas:\nEnhanced custom toolchain support: We’re working on improving support for more complex project setups. This includes adding support for custom sysroots and introducing support for Clang-CL on Windows, which will give you more flexibility in your development environment.\nContinued VFS and performance issues: The initial fixes are just the beginning. Continued VFS optimization remains one of our highest priorities.\nBetter support for virtual includes: We’re also looking into providing better support for virtual includes and generated sources. We understand the importance of this for effectively navigating complex Bazel projects.\nLong-term vision\nOur goal is to eventually provide C and C++ support directly in the new JetBrains Bazel plugin. But before we can do that, two things must happen: The new plugin needs to have matured its Kotlin and Java support through wide real-world usage and user feedback, and we need to be able deliver the same comprehensive C and C++ experience that CLion users expect.\nIn the meantime, Bazel for CLion will continue to be fully supported and maintained.\nShare your feedback\nYour feedback is essential to making this transition successful and ensuring our improvements effectively address real-world challenges. If your project experiences the VFS symptoms we mentioned or relies on a custom toolchain that doesn’t work properly with the plugin, we want to hear from you.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Bazel Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA Is Now Generally Available!\nAfter much anticipation, we are finally ready to announce the general availability (GA) of the new Bazel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, and GoLand – now developed by JetBrains! After months of focused development and valuable feedback from our EAP users, we’re officially launching our revamped Bazel experience.\nWhile we’ve been shipping updates regularly, the leap to our 2025.2 GA release marks a major milestone. Even though our primary focus for this release was on creating the best experience we can for Java, Kotlin, and Scala developers, we also brought support for the Python and Go ecosystems, and we will continue to maintain and improve it in the coming releases.\nIf you’re migrating from the previous plugin originally released by Google, you’ll notice a more straightforward workflow that aligns with the standard JetBrains IDE experience you expect from other build tool integrations such as Maven and Gradle. Now, let’s dive into what’s new!\nKey features in 2025.2\n\nBazel Query in Action\nGo is a go. We’re officially rolling out support for Go. You can now import your Go targets in Bazel projects into both IntelliJ IDEA (with the Go plugin) and GoLand. This brings the full IDE experience you rely on: code highlighting, completion, navigation, and the ability to run, debug, and get coverage for your tests.\nBuilt-in Bazel Query tool window: Go beyond sync and build with Bazel queries integrated directly into your IDE via their own dedicated tool window. Craft your queries with syntax completion and a helpful UI for flags to explore your project’s dependency graph without ever leaving the editor.\nDramatically faster indexing: We’ve optimized indexing to get you to your code faster. You can now use the import_depth and import_ijars settings in your .bazelproject file to prevent the indexing of deep transitive dependencies and index only header jars instead of full jars. What’s more, only the files directly referenced in your .bazelproject view are fully indexed for code intelligence, which can slash indexing times and memory usage in large projects with many auxiliary files.\nNew plugin, new user experience\nBack in December, we publicly announced the EAP (Early Access Program) version of our new plugin and defined what it would take to release it into GA, with an overview of the main differences between the original plugin and the new one.\nHere’s a quick recap for those moving from the older plugin: We’ve smoothed out the rough edges to make Bazel feel like a natural part of the IDE.\nSimplified project import: The old import wizard is a thing of the past. Now, simply open a directory containing your MODULE.bazel or WORKSPACE file. For more control, you can open a specific .bazelproject view file. If you manage a large monorepo, you can provide a default template for your team by checking in a template at tools/intellij/.managed.bazelproject.\nRedesigned UI elements: The Bazel tool window is now your central hub for actions like resyncing your project (with a Build and Resync option for generating sources) and keeping track of targets in your working set. We’ve also added a widget listing all targets the currently opened file belongs to. It allows you to run actions on these targets (build / test / jump to BUILD file / copy target label)\nReworked target mapping for JVM projects: A core improvement is the new internal representation for JVM targets, which mirrors the actual Bazel graph. This fundamental change enables more accurate highlighting, more accurate completions and more reliable refactoring.\nImprovements since 2025.1\nWindows compatibility\nWe understand that development doesn’t just happen on one OS. That’s why we worked on making our plugin compatible with Microsoft Windows, bringing most of the feature set to our Windows-based users.\nEnhanced Bazel configuration support\nWe believe editing your build files should be as easy as editing your source code, which is why we’ve improved the user experience for all Bazel-related configuration files.\nStarlark (.bzl, BUILD)\n\nStarlark Quick Documentation\nQuick documentation for Starlark rules: Hover over a Starlark rule or function to see its documentation directly in the editor. You’ll also get documentation as you type, guiding you through available parameters.\nAutomatic formatting: If you have buildifier on your PATH, the plugin will now automatically format your Starlark files on save\nBazel module configuration file (MODULE.bazel)\nIntelligent editing: The MODULE.bazel editor now offers smart completions for arguments and displays documentation as you edit.\nBazel project view file (.bazelproject) \n\n.bazelproject view highlighting and completions\nGuided editing: Get completions for section names and known values. The editor will now highlight completely unsupported sections as errors and sections that are supported in the old plugin originally by Google (but not in the new one) as warnings.\nManage directories from the Project view file tree: You can now right-click a directory in the project tree to add or remove it from your .bazelproject file, thus loading or unloading that directory in IntelliJ.\nBazelisk configuration file (.bazelversion):\nStay up to date: The editor will now highlight outdated Bazel versions specified in your .bazelversion file and offer a quick-fix to update to the latest release.\nLanguage ecosystem enhancements\nJVM:\n\nThe Show Bytecode feature now works for class files compiled by Bazel.\nThe underlying project model mapping has been further improved, resulting in better performance during sync and more reliable refactorings for targets where glob patterns match the whole directory.\nScala:\n\nThe Bazel plugin now respects the scalacopts parameter in your scala_* targets, which unlocks Scala 3 highlighting features with the -Xsource:3 flag. At the same time, we’ve updated the Scala plugin to provide native integration with the Bazel plugin out of the box.\nPython:\n\nRun from the gutter: py_test and py_binary targets now get the familiar green Run arrow in the editor gutter.\nImproved dependency resolution: Python dependencies are now resolved correctly, enabling code navigation and eliminating false error highlighting.\nInterpreter from MODULE.bazel: The plugin now sets the Python interpreter based on what is defined in MODULE.bazel. This includes support for hermetic toolchains downloaded by rules_python – meaning you don’t need to have Python installed locally on your machine.\nDebugging: You can now attach the debugger to py_test targets.\nWhat happens to the Bazel plugin by Google?\nThe Bazel for IntelliJ plugin (also known as IJwB) by Google is being deprecated. Google has transferred the code ownership and maintenance to JetBrains. We will keep providing compatibility updates for new IntelliJ versions and critical fixes only throughout the year of 2025, but will be fully deprecating it in 2026. All our development effort for IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, and PyCharm is now focused on the new plugin.\nThe Bazel for CLion plugin (CLwB) has also been transferred to JetBrains, and will continue to be actively developed. Learn more in the post Enhancing Bazel Support for CLion on the CLion Blog.\nGot feedback? We’re listening!\nWe’re committed to making this the best Bazel experience possible. Please report any issues, ideas, or improvements straight to our issue tracker.\nFixed the problem yourself? We accept PRs on our hirschgarten repository.\nYou’ll also find us on the Bazel Community Slack, in the #intellij channel.\nHappy building!",

Besides that, we will work closely with the PhpStorm team on many features, like AI, native support for Laravel magic, etc.”\n\n            \nAdel Faizrakhmanov\n                                                                Creator of Laravel Idea\n                                    \nTo install the Laravel Idea plugin in PhpStorm, go to Settings | Plugins and search for the plugin in the Marketplace tab.\n\n\n\n\nAfter installation, you can configure the plugin settings via Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Laravel Idea.\nWhy PhpStorm IDE for Laravel development?\nPhpStorm is recommended by Laravel for working on Laravel projects. Besides the Laravel Idea plugin, PhpStorm provides Laravel developers with loads of developer productivity features out of the box, including:\nJunie, your AI coding agent by JetBrains for professional tasks. \nBuilt-in support for Laravel Pint, Pest, Larastan, and Artisan CLI commands.\nSyntax highlighting and code completion in Blade templates and .env files. \nIDE support for JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks, including Tailwind, Vue, and React, and databases. \nBest-in-class tools for code navigation and refactoring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Laravel Idea plugin will eventually be bundled with PhpStorm and available to the IDE users out of the box.\n“I’m really excited that full Laravel support is now more accessible than ever for our users. We’ve worked hard to make PhpStorm the best IDE for Laravel development, and making Laravel Idea available for free is a big step forward.”\n\n            \nArtemy Pestretsov\n                                                                Product Leader at PhpStorm\n                                    \nLearn more about Laravel support in PhpStorm on our website.\nFAQ\nI have an IntelliJ Ultimate subscription, do I also get the Laravel Idea plugin for free?\nYes, the Laravel Idea plugin is now also available to IntelliJ Ultimate users for free.\nIs there any compensation for already purchased Laravel Idea licenses?\nIndividual PhpStorm users who purchased a monthly or yearly personal Laravel Idea license on May 1, 2025, or later are eligible for compensation in the form of a 50% discount on the next renewal of their personal PhpStorm subscription. This compensatory discount will be applied in your JetBrains Account automatically at the billing date of the next subscription renewal.\nWhy aren’t all active Laravel Idea subscriptions eligible for compensation?\nMay 1, 2025, marks the date we internally decided to make the Laravel Idea plugin part of PhpStorm and started working on it. We believe it’s fair to provide compensation to the users who purchased licenses after that date, as we had not announced this decision publicly at that time. Users who purchased the yearly license before did so when we were still operating under the third-party plugin business terms. \nCan I get a refund for my Laravel Idea purchase?\nYou can request a refund as long as it’s within the eligible refund period. For more information about refunds, see the Licensing and Purchasing FAQ page. Note that, after receiving a refund, you are no longer eligible for the compensatory 50% discount on your PhpStorm subscription.\nI have an active Laravel Idea subscription. Should I cancel it manually?\nNo action is needed. You will not be charged for Laravel Idea at the next subscription renewal, even if the license is still active in your JetBrains Account.\nMy licensing case is not addressed in this FAQ. What should I do?\nPlease contact our Support team at phpstorm-support@jetbrains.com and provide the details of your case.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In online learning environments, tasks can often stump students, which can be challenging to navigate since teachers can’t always be there to help. Our Education Research team develops innovative features for education tools and recently built a smart AI-based hints tool that provides personalized feedback for students who might need help solving tasks. This tool goes beyond the automated hints common in massive open online courses (MOOCs) and delivers tailored, effective guidance that helps students move forward. \nTry the plugin!\n                                    \nIn this post, we will:\nExplore the currently available options for automated assistance in MOOCs.\nPresent our AI-based hint system, showing how it works and what’s technically interesting about it.\nDiscuss how students evaluated the plugin and what’s up next in this research stream.\nLearning in online courses\nIn its early days, distance learning was intended for people who were unable to attend classroom lectures, usually full-time workers, military personnel, and those in remote regions. The model has been around for some centuries already: people could take so-called correspondence courses per post, documented as early as the 1720s in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. Sir Isaac Pitman offered correspondence courses with feedback in the mid 1800s from Gloucestershire, UK, and universities were not far behind: students could obtain a degree through the University of London starting in 1858, regardless of whether they lived in London or not. \nLet’s zoom ahead to 2000, when online institutions like the University of Phoenix in the USA and The Open University in the UK had already been offering online courses to obtain degrees for about 30 years. As technology became more advanced and the infrastructure evolved for better access to affordable and fast internet, online courses surged in popularity.  \nThe importance of feedback\nThe first MOOC is often credited to Stephen Downes and George Siemens, who in 2008 made it possible for more than 2000 students online to attend their course in addition to the 25 students at the University of Manitoba campus in Canada. Since then, and especially during the pandemic, MOOCs have become more popular, with many available platforms. For example, there are platforms from universities like MIT and Harvard (their non-profit consortium is now edX and includes many more partners) and private companies like Udacity and Coursera. JetBrains offers its own project-based courses through JetBrains Academy, where learners can build tech skills using the same tools developers rely on every day.\n\nCourse catalog\n                                    \nAlready the online, often asynchronous, nature of such largely-attended courses poses a problem for helping students in a personalized way. We know that feedback is essential to the learning process, and that there are different types of feedback (see, for example, The Power of Feedback and this review specifically on automated feedback types). Courses with high matriculation numbers, whether on campus or online, often include automated assessments. Sometimes these courses additionally include smaller tutoring sessions, where feedback may be more personalized. Those students receiving both automated and personalized feedback are more likely to improve their learning than those receiving only automated feedback, as confirmed in, e.g., this 2024 paper.\nRecently, researchers have started developing automated ways to provide students with more personalized feedback, such as predefining rules or templates, using systems based on previous student submissions, or incorporating large language models (see this recent overview for more details). Here we focus on the landscape of a particular type of assistance for students learning programming online, next-step hint generation, and explore the approaches currently available.\nProviding hints to students in online learning\nNext-step hint generation is a powerful approach that provides students with targeted, incremental guidance to help them progress through their courses. So when stuck, they are presented with what specific, small step will help them proceed. Once that step is completed, and if they need another hint, another step will be given. For example, a student could be stuck on a programming task and cannot figure out why. To help, the hint could suggest something like the following:\n“Add a for loop that iterates over the indices of the ‘secret’ string.”\nHints can be generated as text like in the example above, (pseudo-)code, or a combination of both. Research has shown that only one type of feedback is not enough, and that students learn better when there are several levels like text and code. Instead of only pointing out errors or giving full solutions, they offer adaptive suggestions, include text explanations, and nudge learners toward the next logical step. Hints break down complex tasks into manageable pieces and encourage independent problem-solving, making them an essential tool for personalized learning support.\nWith the recent onset of large language models (LLMs), a few researchers have been exploring the possibilities of combining the open APIs of LLMs, such as gpt-3.5 and gpt-4, with personalized feedback generation. This type of approach comes with the benefit that researchers do not need a large amount of data on student submissions. So far there exist only a handful of these types of systems. Examples of a few tools can be found in the table below, including information about the hint type, where the tool can be used, and features; see this 2022 state-of-the-art review for more details.\n\nThe first two tools, CodeHelp and CodeAid, use gpt-3.5, while CS50.ai uses gpt-4. All tools in the table above only use the LLM directly; that is, there is no additional output processing. Without this processing, potential inaccuracies (such as hallucinations or ignored prompt instructions) can arise, thereby compromising the hint quality. The tools also require students to craft their own prompts, adding an extra challenge for students, especially beginners who are already known to struggle with seeking help.\nTo address such challenges, our research team developed a tool with the following features:\nPart of the course’s integrated development environment (IDE)\nBoth text and code hints\nProcessing of the LLM-generated code\nAI-based hints for in-IDE Learning\nOur researchers from the Education Research lab recently developed an AI-based tool for the open-source JetBrains Academy plugin. This research is a part of the PhD work of the lab’s head, Anastasiia Birillo, completed under the supervision of Dr. Hieke Keuning in the Software Technology for Learning and Teaching Group at Utrecht University. \nThe JetBrains Academy plugin is an extension for JetBrains IDEs, created specifically to support in-IDE learning. The plugin adapts the IDE window by adding a course structure panel, course progress bar, task description panel with theory, explanations, and non-coding types of assignments, and a check button for running tests predefined by the course author. There are already over 50 courses compatible with this format, and any third-party educator can add their own compatible course. \nCheck it out!\n                                    \nThe plugin provides different assignment types, and these tasks can be isolated or combined within a larger project. The types of tasks can be categorized as:\nTheoretical: concepts explained in a text or a video form with related quiz questions or coding tasks\nPractical: a quiz or a programming assignment\nWith the combination of the hint tool with the plugin, students learn programming languages by coding and simultaneously receiving personalized feedback, all within the IDE. If you are interested in what students and developers think about in-IDE learning, check out this recent paper where our researchers conducted interviews to learn about just that. \nHow our hint system works\nBefore getting into the technical features that set our AI-based hint tool apart from tools like the ones mentioned above, let’s look at how the tool works. Here are a few basic technical features:\nThe system uses gpt-4o for all LLM interactions.\nThe system generates both text and code hints.\nIt was originally designed for Kotlin and this version has been validated (see below). \nA Python version was developed later and is already available in the JetBrains Academy plugin.\nIn the example image below, a student is creating a program to simulate the game Hangman, where a user can try to guess a word by inputting letters. The current task requires the student to implement a complex function, generateNewUserWord. In the example, the student has already defined newUserWord and separator, but they don’t know how to implement the part of the function concerning already guessed letters. \n\n\n\n\nTo get help with the task, the student can request a hint by clicking the blue check button at the bottom (below the text hint). Clicking this button runs test cases, checks whether the code compiles, and displays the following two elements:\nThe text hint, on the bottom right side, marked with a pink rectangle\nThe highlighted position in the code, marked with a green rectangle\nThe highlighting feature is an important part of the design because (i) the hint system should be complex enough to help students with tasks longer than one function, and (ii) when there is a long file and the student is stuck anyway, it might not be obvious where to apply the hint. \nWithin the textual hint window, there is also a show in code link. As suggested by its name, it provides the student access to the code hint, which appears as a window with highlighted differences between the student’s code and the solution code. This can be seen in the following screenshot, where the code hint is marked in pink.\n\n\n\n\nOn the lower right side of the above image, rows 31–32 are highlighted in green. In this case, these rows represent what is missing from the student’s code, namely, the for loop which should iterate over the indices of the secret string, as stated in the text hint. \nFrom this code hint, the student can choose to accept the hint (found on the top of the above image), in which case the suggested changes are automatically applied, or cancel the hint and return to their own solution to manually modify it. This means the code hint provides bottom-out help, or the exact code needed to progress to the next step. As you can see in the example above, the code hint does not provide the content of the for loop, so the student has a chance to continue on their own.\nStudents may request a next-step hint at any time during the task, except when the task is already solved. The hints can help the students proceed with the task, or fix a test or compilation errors. There is currently no limitation on the number of hint requests in the plugin’s current version; JetBrains Academy is a MOOC platform where students voluntarily participate in courses, so it is ultimately up to them how they want to learn.\nNot only does the in-IDE course format provide students with a professional environment to build their coding skills, it is also a good environment for implementing a novel next-step hint system. For one, the programming assignments can be complex, and the IDE conveniently provides several crucial features, such as an API for static analysis and code quality analysis, the topic of the next subsection.\nCode hint quality improvement in the IDE\nOne might think that because the text hint is shown first to the students, the hint system must also internally generate the text hint before the code one. According to this 2024 paper, as well as our own internal validation reported in §5 of our paper, a hint system delivers much better results when it generates the code hint before the text hint.\nWith code as the main entity, we can apply cool IDE features to improve the code instead of just showing an unprocessed hint to the student. For the code processing, we used static analysis and code quality analysis. The figure below depicts the internal system pipeline.\n\n\n\n\nA key feature of our approach is that we process the LLM-generated code using static analysis and code quality analysis, so that the code is examined without executing the program. Automated tools like those found in our JetBrains IDEs can scan a project’s code to check for vulnerabilities such as:\nProgramming errors\nCoding standard violations\nUndefined values\nSyntax violations\nOur AI-based hint system uses an LLM to generate code based on the student’s code and any error information. However, LLMs are inherently unreliable, having the well-known potential to produce hallucinations (see this 2024 paper and this other 2024 paper for recent research), and we wanted the hints provided to students to be the most accurate possible. The combination of in-IDE code processing and generating the code hint before the text hint enabled us to create a tool with high hint accuracy. \nThe code processing included ensuring code quality and controlling hint size, among other improvements (more details are available in the paper). The following list describes each in more detail: \nTo improve the quality of the generated code, we used the IDE’s code quality inspections for optimizing code and for correcting common security and style issues. We selected 30 Kotlin inspections for which automatic fixes are available. The following code blocks show an example:\nmonth >= && month <= 12\nThe comparison code from above gets transformed into a Kotlin range as below.\n1..12\nLLMs do not always comprehend that only one step needs to be generated, even within one function. We believe that a good hint provides one logical action, not multiple ones at a time. To control the hint size, we developed some heuristics (more details can be found in the paper’s supplementary material). The figure below shows an example with additive statement isolation.\n\n\n\n\nBy processing the LLM-generated code before the student sees the hint, we can greatly improve the hint’s quality. This quality control gives our hint system an advantage over previously developed tools.\nHint system evaluation by students\nIn addition to the quality control described in the previous subsection, we validated the quality of the systems with experts and got feedback from students who used the tool in a course. In this subsection, we will only talk about the student validation; the details of the expert validation can be found in §5 of our paper. \nAs described above, hints have been developed for many MOOCs but less so for in-IDE courses, meaning that the MOOC-hint format is well-studied, while the in-IDE-hint format is not. Considering this, plus the fact that the IDE setting is inherently complex, we were interested in finding out how best to show text hints.\nTo find out, we conducted a user experience study, containing 15-minute comparative usability interviews with nine students of varying degrees of experience in programming.  \nFrom the interviews, we learned that students prefer having:\nThe hint in the same context as the task, in contrast to the hint in the code window\nThe relevant position highlighted in the code\nOn top of how to best show text hints, we were interested in what they thought about the usefulness and ease of use of the provided hints, both by looking at usage data and by asking the students directly. The data comes from fourteen students who completed five to six projects in the in-IDE Kotlin Onboarding: Introduction course, available in the JetBrains Academy catalog. More specifically, we used the KOALA tool to collect in-IDE activity data from the students who agreed to participate, followed by a qualitative assessment with open-ended questions.\nOverall, we collected 64,512 code snippets; if you are interested in the dataset for research purposes, you can contact our team.  The data indicated that:\nStudents requested text hints 191 times. \nOf those 191 times, students requested to see a code hint about half the time (101). \nRequest distribution across the course’s projects varied: the first basic projects contained less hint-requesting data than the later projects. \nIn the qualitative survey, 14 students were asked why they requested a hint, and could give multiple answers. The figure below shows the four most popular reasons for choosing a hint.\n\n\n\n\nAs seen in the figure above, the students reported using the hint system for its purpose, as well as for their own curiosity. There is additionally room for improvement with respect to compilation errors. \nWe also asked them further questions. Insights from their responses are summarized in the following:\nWhen asked what they did when the hint was unclear, 11 of the 14 students said they then tried to solve the task on their own, without searching online or asking an LLM. \nHalf of the students said they preferred to see a combination of both text and code hints, which aligns with what we saw in the TaskTracker data, where about half of the students requested both text and code hints.\nA key insight from the interviews was that the hint system is most helpful for beginner students. The hint tool is more helpful than searching online, because students at that level do not know what to search for or what prompt to use to ask an LLM. The flipside of this is that more advanced students prefer a chat-based interface, as in CS50.ai (see above), suggesting that a future version of our system would benefit from combining hints with a chat feature.  In general, the students gave positive feedback on our hints system, with many indicating that they would be interested in continuing to use it for future courses. \nWatch this space for a follow-up study, where we analyzed how another set of students used the hint tool. This work looks specifically at where any pain points might arise, and what can be done to improve students’ learning experience. \nIn the meantime, if you are interested in collaborating with our Education Research team, you can find more information on their website.",

In this version, introspection by levels is now supported for PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, giving you greater control over the metadata loaded for these databases. For PostgreSQL, a smart refresh mechanism has been implemented to significantly reduce the time spent refreshing schema. Database objects can now be attached to the AI chat for a specific context, and AI Assistant provides cloud-based code completion for your scripts. Our data editor and code editor have also received several improvements, including editable multi-table JOIN results and a floating toolbar displaying a set of context-based and AI-driven actions. Let’s take a look at what it has to offer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload DataGrip 2025.2 \nAI Assistant features\nPreviously, it was only possible to attach entire database schemas to the AI chat. Now, you can attach specific database objects by mentioning them with @dbObject: or #dbObject: in the input field.\n\n\n\n\nWith cloud-based code completion, DataGrip can autocomplete single lines, blocks of code, and even entire scripts in real time based on the available context. The generated SQL is similar to how you would write your statements, matching your style and naming conventions.\n\n\n\n\nConnectivity\nWe’ve made the introspection by levels feature available for PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server databases. For PostgreSQL, the smart refresh feature has now been implemented, as well:\nIntrospection by levels allows DataGrip to automatically adjust the amount of loaded metadata based on the database size. \nWith smart refresh, only the objects that could potentially be modified when a given query is executed are refreshed.\n\n\n\n\nFor SQLite, you can now access and work with database files in WSL, as we have addressed the issue in WSL that was causing database files to be locked once you access them.\n\n\n\n\nWhen setting up a connection to MongoDB, you can now specify the way read operations are routed to the members of a MongoDB replica set, and even define which replica set should be used.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with data\nIn our data editor, the result set grid for SELECT queries with JOIN clauses is now editable. You can use this feature to change the cell values right in the query result grid, preview the generated DML, and submit your changes to the database.\n\n\n\n\nWe have also implemented a grid heatmap. Use one of the two available color schemes to highlight cells based on their values.\n\n\n\n\nYou can clear local filters for all columns in your grid by using just one action from the Find Action popup.\n\n\n\n\nCode editor\nIn our code editor, you can invoke a set of context-based and AI-driven actions simply by selecting a piece of code and using the floating toolbar that appears.\n\n\n\n\nUse the Cancel Running Statement button in the gutter to cancel a running statement in the editor. To see the button, hover over the progress icon.\n\n\n\n\nWe have addressed the inconvenience of data sources being detached from SQL files when the IDE is restarted. Data sources now stay attached to files. In addition, the Files tool window displays the attached data source names next to the SQL file names in the file tree.\n\n\n\n\nThe code reformatting popup message now includes a handy link to the SQL code style settings page in the IDE’s Settings dialog.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in upgrading to DataGrip 2025.2, or if you have any questions or suggestions, here are a few links you might find useful:\nDownload DataGrip 2025.2.\nVisit our What’s New page for the full list of improvements.\nContact us on X.\nReport any bugs to our issue tracker.\n\n\n\n\nThe DataGrip team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When we first set out to get smarter AI edits in Visual Studio Copilot, we knew we were tackling a deeply complex problem. It wasn’t just about generating great suggestions—it was about figuring out how to seamlessly apply those suggestions to your code. While the idea seemed simple at first glance, the reality was anything but.   \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/SideBySideNewMapper.mp4\n\nThe Complexity of Implementing AI-Generated Edits \nLet’s rewind to our early attempts. Copilot might give you a fantastic suggestion—a new method, a helpful refactor, or maybe even a corrected logic block. But the real challenge began when we tried to insert those changes into the existing file without breaking anything. Where does the edit go? What happens if the file has been updated since the suggestion was generated? What if the model’s output inadvertently introduces conflicts, overlaps existing code, or even forgets a required bracket? These questions made the process tricky, and the resulting red squiggles made it difficult to trust AI suggestions. \nIn the early days, we approached this problem in the most straightforward way possible: brute force. We used heuristics and rule-based techniques like string matching and pattern recognition to identify where edits might belong. It worked… kind of. The results were often inconsistent, especially for complex edits spanning multiple lines. And as Copilot’s capabilities expanded to support more languages and scenarios, maintaining these rules became a moving target—always shifting, always growing harder to manage. Success rates hovered around 50%, which was far from ideal. In hindsight, it became increasingly clear that we couldn’t outpace the ever-evolving models with static rules.   \nBetter Models Meet Smarter Techniques \nAs AI technology advanced, we saw an opportunity to revisit this problem with a fresh perspective. Two major developments in AI made it possible to rethink how we could get smarter edits in Visual Studio Copilot: modern models with larger context windows and a groundbreaking technique called speculative decoding.   \nSpeculative decoding became a game changer for speeding up AI-assisted edits. It works by pairing a fast model with a more sophisticated one. The fast model generates token predictions for the edit ahead of time, while the smarter model steps in only when needed to refine or verify those predictions. This collaboration improved average token generation speed by 2-3x and made it feasible to implement the generated edits using the model, which significantly enhanced accuracy when integrating changes into your files.   \nBy using speculative decoding, we adopted the model-based approach to applying edits that was able to fill in the gaps that the previous approach could not reach. Instead of relying on rule sets, we employed an AI model to simulate an “ideal” version of your file with the chosen suggestions seamlessly integrated. A smart diff algorithm then compares this ideal version with your actual file to pinpoint and precisely map the edits. This allowed the entire process to handle edge cases—like overlapping code or missing syntax—more intelligently than ever before.      \nBalancing Accuracy and Speed \nWhile speculative decoding dramatically improved performance, applying AI edits still came with a natural trade-off: using models introduced latency. Previously, all string computation was done locally, meaning edits appeared almost instantly. Now, every edit involved network calls and token generation—a process that unfolds incrementally as a token stream, rather than as a single, instant response.   \nTo make this experience feel meaningful for users, we implemented a streaming animation in the editor. As edits are detected on the token stream, users see their document updating line by line in real time. This animation serves two purposes: showcasing progress and providing visibility into exactly how the changes are being applied. Although this approach trades the speed we had before for greater accuracy, feedback has shown that users value precision over raw speed—especially when it comes to maintaining code quality and reducing disruption.      \nLooking Ahead\nThis work laid the foundation for Agent Mode in Visual Studio Copilot—a feature that enables the AI to not only suggest improvements but actively assist in executing them. For Agent Mode to function effectively, the edits needed to be precise, seamless, and reliable enough for the agent to build, debug, and test the code. Speculative decoding has already made significant strides in balancing speed and accuracy, but we’re not stopping there.\nA faster implementation of our speculative decoding technique is on the horizon. This updated version will leverage advancements in token generation and model pairing to further reduce latency while maintaining accuracy users have come to expect. Early tests show promise of a 2-4x speed boost compared to the original rollout, moving closer to the ideal experience where precision meets near-instant response times. \nThe post Smarter AI Edits in Visual Studio Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

VMD Controller를 활성화하기 전에 Windows에 드라이버를 설치해줘야 한다.\n그런데 VMD Controller를 활성화하기 전에 intel RST드라이버를 설치하려고 해도 하드웨어적으로 VMD 장치가 확인되지 않기 때문에(활성화되어있지 않기 때문에) Windows에서 드라이버 설치가 안된다.\n부분적으로 2개 슬롯만 VMD 모드로 돌릴 수 있으면 좋겠다고 생각했는데 찾아보니 메인보드에 기능이 있다. OS설치된 SSD는 제외시키고 다른 2개의 SSD만 VMD Controller제어로 두고 부팅하면 부팅도 정상적으로 되고 RST드라이버도 설치 가능하다. 물론 2개의 SSD는 당장은 잡히지 않는다. RST드라이버를 설치한 후에는 VMD제어로 둔 SSD 2개도 다 인식된다.\n이후 다시 bios셋업으로 들어가서 raid로 묶으면 된다.\n이전에는 RAID로 묶을 때면 VMD Global Map을 켜 둔 상태로 두었다. 이게 기본상태였기 때문이다. 딱히 신경쓰진 않았가. 하지만 이렇게 하면 모든 PCI Root Port가 VMD Controller관리하로 들어간다.\nVMD Global Map을 끄면 PCI Root Port별로 VMD를 사용할지 AHCI모드를 사용할지 결정할 수 있다. 포트별로 Bus/Device/Fuction id가 표시되는데 이것으로 어떤 ssd를 제외시킬지 식별할 수 있다. 내 SSD가 어느 Root Port에 붙어있는지는 Windows 장치관리자에서 확인하면 된다.\n이렇게 해서 최종적으로 데탑은 990pro + 970evo x 2 raid0로 세팅을 완료했다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "전에 한번 비슷한 이야기를 한 적이 있는데, 내가 봤을 때 지금이 시의적절한 타이밍이라서 다시 한번 내 생각을 포스팅해 본다.\n2022년 후반부터 시작된 벤처 겨울은 아직도 진행 중이지만, 이제 최악의 추위로부터 우린 조금씩 멀어지고 있지 않나 싶다. AI 투자 덕분에 외형적으론 글로벌 벤처 투자는 2024년 Q3($57B)부터 2025년 Q1($121B) 까지 연속 3사분기 상승 중이다. 실은 벤처투자가 증가하고 있다는 건 VC들에게 자금을 제공하는 LP들도 더 활발하게 투자하고 있다는 간접적인 증거이기 때문에 여러모로 좋은 시그널이다. 하지만, 너무 많은 돈이 극소수의 AI 회사에 투입되고 있다는 건 – 예를 들면, 2025년 Q1 전체 글로벌 벤처 투자금 $121B 중 거의 3분의 1인 $40B이 OpenAI 단 한 개의 회사에 투입됐다 – 아직도 뭔가 불안하고 찜찜하지만, 어쨌든 부정적인 것보단 긍정적인 신호라고 생각한다.\n한국도 여기저기서 긍정적인 소식이 들려온다. 새로운 정부가 AI에 100조 원을 투자하겠다고 발표했고, 벤처 투자 생태계에도 40조 원가량의 자금을 투입하겠다고 했다. 솔직히 말해서 이 돈을 어디서 어떻게 조달할진 잘 모르겠지만, 긍정적인 소식이며, 하반기에는 유동성이 조금씩 풀리지 않을까 기대한다. 정부가 벤처 투자를 리딩하는 건 장기적으론 부정적인 면도 많지만, 반면에 현재와 같은 위기 상황에서는 정부가 이렇게 시원하게 쏘는 것만큼 단기적으론 좋은 방법도 없다고 생각한다.\n이런 시그널이 보이는 분위기에서 요새 나는 우리 창업가분들에게 다음과 같은 조언을 하고 있다.\n첫째, 2022년 후반부터 성장보단 생존과 수익성에 집중하고 있는 회사 중, 아직도 비용을 못 줄여서 매달 마이너스가 나고, 명확하게 공식화할 수 없는 PMF와 비즈니스 모델을 못 찾은 분들에겐 계속하던 대로 성장보단 생존에 집중하라고 한다. 이런 회사들은 아직도 한 달 벌어 한 달 먹고사는 곳들이 많아서 계속 비용 절감과 비즈니스 모델 확립에 집중해야 한다. 운전에 비유하자면, 고속도로보단 계속 국도로 달리는 것이다. 국도에서 가속하지 말고, 정속 주행을 통해서 기름을 아끼는 전략이다. 하지만, 조금씩 천천히 앞으로 가곤 있다.\n둘째, 2022년 후반부터 성장보단 생존과 수익성에 집중하면서 지난 3년 동안 비용 절감에 성공해서 흑자 전환을 했고, 어떻게 하면 확실하게 돈을 벌 수 있는지 공식화할 수 있는 비즈니스 모델과 PMF를 찾았다면, 이제 다시 서서히 성장에 대해 고민해 보라고 한다. 운전에 비유하자면, 이제 국도를 서서히 벗어나면서 다시 고속도로에 진입해서 악셀러레이터를 힘차게 밟아보는 것이다. 하지만, 그렇다고 대책 없이 돈을 써서 마이너스를 내면서 성장하라는 조언은 아니다. 지금까지 만들어 놓은 좋은 비즈니스 모델을 돈을 버는 프레임 안에서 더 가속하라는 조언이다.\n이렇게 국도에서 다시 고속도로로 진입하려면 돈도 더 필요하고, 어쩌면 사람도 더 필요한데, 이보다 더 중요한 건, 창업가의 마인드와 태도의 180도 변화이다. 너무 오랫동안 국도만 달렸기 때문에 다시 고속도로로 진입해서 그동안 시속 50km를 넘지 않았던 악셀러레이터를 더 밟아서 80km 이상으로 달려야 하는데, 다시 성장 모드로 마인드를 바꾸는 게 쉽지 않다. 회사의 전략과 방향을 180도 다르게 설정하는 데에도 switching cost가 발생하지만, 실은 가장 극복하기 어려운 건 창업가의 두려움이다. 이미 지난 3년 동안 돈이 없으면 얼마나 사업이 힘들어지는지 뼈저리게 경험하고 배웠기 때문에 다시 성장에 집중하는 게 너무 공포스러울 수도 있을 것이다. 성장에 집중하려면, 펀드레이징도 다시 해야 하고, 더 많은 돈을 써야 하는데, 혹시라도 이렇게 하는 과정에서 돈을 다 써서 다시 힘든 시점이 오면, 그땐 다시 한번 어려움을 극복할 수 있는 체력과 정신력이 남아 있을지,,,그 생각만 해도 공황장애가 오기 때문이다.\n아직 제대로 된 비즈니스 모델을 못 찾았다면, 계속 비용 절감하면서 생존에 집중해라. 이런 사업이면 어차피 고속도로에 진입해도 속력도 못 내고 금세 연료가 떨어져서 멈출 것이다. 하지만, 이제 돈을 확실하게 벌 수 있는 사업을 만들었다면 위에서 말한 두려움을 떨쳐내고 과감하게 고속도로에 진입해라. 그리고 다시 쌩쌩 달릴 수 있는 방법을 찾아야 한다. 어차피 스타트업이란 어느 시점엔 성장을 해야 하는데, 이미 3년이라는 시간을 까먹었기 때문에 따라잡아야 하는 거리가 상당히 많이 남았을 것이다. 다시 한번 용기를 내어보자.",

만난다. 소규모 친목 모임을 생각하지 마시라. 조선 후기에는 계의 규모에 따라 이름도 달리 붙였는데, 100명이 모이면 ‘작백계’, 1,000명이면 ‘천인계’, 10,000명이면 ‘만인계’라고 불렀다. 계원들에게 일정액의 곗돈을 걷은 후 정해진 날 추첨을 통해 당첨자를 뽑아 모인 돈의 약 80%를 복채금(당첨금)으로 지급하는 형태였다. \n그 중에서도 만인계 인기가 높았다. 추첨일이 되면 마을 공터나 산비탈에 사람들이 구름처럼 몰려들었고, 둥그런 나무통에 추첨 번호를 넣어 돌리는 방식으로 당첨자를 뽑았다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}당첨금의 일정 금액은 지방 관청에 납부했고, 관청은 이 돈을 도로나 다리 같은 지역 인프라를 만드는 데 사용했다.\n만인계와 관련된 흥미로운 이야기가 있다. 이토 히로부미를 저격한 독립운동가, 안중근 의사가 청년 시절 만인계의 사장을 맡았던 것이다. 20대 초반, 괄괄하고 리더십 강한 성격의 안중근은 우연한 계기로 만인계의 돈을 관리하고 추첨하는 채표 회사 사장이 되었다. 추첨이 있던 날 수만명이 모였는데 당첨자를 뽑는 통에 문제가 생겼다. 번호표가 한 장만 나와야 하는데 여러 장이 쏟아져 나온 것이다. 군중은 흥분했고 ‘사기다!’라며 소리를 지르거나 주먹을 휘둘렀다. 이 찰나에 안중근은 총을 꺼내며 외쳤다..css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;} “내가 쏟은 게 아니고, 이 통이 쏟아진 것을 왜 나를 죽이네 살리네 한단 말이오!” 20대의 안중근 의사는 가까스로 상황을 모면할 수 있었다고 한다.\n만인계는 많은 사람들의 참여를 통해 자금을 모았고, 그 중 일부를 공공에 환원한다는 점에서 오늘날 복권 제도와 유사하다.\n해방 이후: 복권이 나라를 살릴 수도 있을까?\n1945년 해방 이후 대한민국은 극심한 혼란을 겪었다. 35년간의 식민지 생활 후 200만 명이 넘는 재외 동포의 귀환, 그리고 6.25 전쟁의 발발. 나라는 지독히 가난했다. 정부는 구호 기금 마련을 목적으로 복권을 발행하였다. 1949년 10월부터 1960년 6월까지 세 차례에 걸쳐 ‘후생 복표’라는 이름의 복권을 발행해 복권 1매당 200원씩 판매했고, 당첨금은 100만 원이었는데 지금의 수억 원에 달하는 큰 금액이었다. 이후에도 전후 사업 부흥 자금을 모으기 위해 ‘애국 복권’을 발행했다. 이 시기의 복권은 국가 재건을 위한 절박한 선택지였다.\n복권과 관련하여 애틋한 사연도 있다. 1948년은 제14회 런던올림픽이 개최되는 해. 우리나라는 선수단의 식비나 교통비조차 마련하기 어려운 형편이었다. 이러한 상황 가운데 독립운동가 출신의 전경무를 중심으로 ‘대한올림픽위원회’*는 ‘올림픽 후원권’이라는 복권을 발행한다. 1등 100만 원, 2등 50만 원, 3등 10만 원의 당첨금을 걸었던 복권은 성공적으로 판매되었고, 그 결과 약 8만 달러의 자금을 모을 수 있었다. 덕분에 대한민국 선수단은 런던 올림픽 무대에 설 수 있었다. 독립국가 대한민국은 처음으로 올림픽이라는 국제 스포츠 무대를 경험 할 수 있었고 놀랍게도 권투와 역도에서 동메달 2개를 획득했다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*1946년 창설된 뒤 올림픽과 아시안게임에 국가대표를 파견하는 역할을 해왔고, 2009년에는 대한체육회로 통합되었다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n제14회 런던올림픽 후원권. 복권에 대한올림픽 부위원장이었던 전경무의 얼굴이 새겨져 있다. 독립운동가 출신으로 임시정부를 도왔던 전경무는 해방 후 체육 부흥을 위해 동분서주했고 직접 IOC에 대한민국의 참가를 신청하러 가던 중 비행기 추락사고로 목숨을 잃었다. / 출처: 국가유산청 \n중세 유럽에서도 복권은 국가 재정의 숨은 도구였다. 16세기 중반 영국의 엘리자베스 1세는 스페인과의 전쟁에서 승리하기 위해 함정을 건조하고 항구를 정비할 목적으로 복권을 발행했다. 프랑스도 마찬가지였다. 절대 군주 루이 14세의 사치와 전쟁으로 바닥나버린 국고를 메우기 위해 루이 15세는 복권을 도입했는데 이를 통해 200만 프랑의 매출을 올렸고 그중 1/4을 파리의 공공사업에 투자했다.\n이처럼 복권은 국가 재정 정책에 있어 부수적이지만 쏠쏠한 수단이 되었고 복지와 공공 기반 확충에 기여할 수 있었다. 이런 이유 때문에 국가는 복권 발행에 따른 사행성 문제에도 불구하고 다양한 방식의 복권 사업을 직접 주도하거나 독점적으로 관리해 온 것이다.\n70년대: 준비하시고- 쏘세요\n1969년 9월 15일 첫 발행된 ‘주택복권’은 우리나라에서 처음으로 정기 발행된 복권이었다. 과거 복권이 ‘후생 복표’, ‘애국 복권’ 등 특정한 목적에 따라 한시적으로 운영되었던 것과 달리 주택복권은 월 1회, 주 1회 식으로 정기적으로 운영되어 국민 곁으로 적극 다가왔다.\n1970년대 들어 산업화가 본격적으로 진행되는 가운데, 많은 국민들이 ‘내 집 마련’이라는 기대가 부풀어 올랐고 이에 부응하면서 주택복권이 등장했다. 당시 주택복권은 한국주택은행이 발행했는데 저소득층 주거 안정 사업 지원을 표방하며 1969년 9월 15일 복권 1매당 100원씩, 발행 총액 5천만 원, 1등 당첨금을 3백만 원으로 판매를 시작했다.\n\n매일경제신문에 게재된 제1회 주택복권 발매 광고 / 출처: 매일경제\n주택복권 추첨 장면은 TV로 생중계되었는데 흑백TV가 보급되면서 시작된 진기한 풍경이었다. 당첨자 선정은 숫자가 적힌 원반을 돌린 뒤 화살을 쏘아 당첨 번호를 정하는 방식이었다. “준비하시고- 쏘세요!” 라는 아나운서의 멘트는 당시 최고의 유행어가 되기도 했다. 복권 추첨이 단순한 이벤트를 넘어 하나의 대중문화 콘텐츠가 된 것이다.\n주택복권은 빠르게 대중의 일상으로 스며들었다. 초기에는 월 1회 발행되었지만, 점차 발행주기가 늘어나 1972년에는 주 1회로 확대되었고, 당첨금은 하루가 빠르게 높아졌다. 1969년 1등 당첨금은 300만 원.  6년 후인 1975년 8월 경에는 900만 원, 1984년 중반에는 1억 원으로 당첨금은 수직 상승하게 된다. 그만큼 한국의 경제 성장과 물가 상승, 무엇보다 집값의 오름세가 가팔랐다.\n당시 신문에는 ‘주택 복권 인기 시들’, ‘당첨 금액 파격적으로 높여’ 같은 문구가 자주 등장한다. 정부는 복권을 통해 건설·교통 분야의 자금을 조달하고자 했고, 당첨금을 인상함으로써 국민의 관심을 유지하려 했다. 대중적인 인기를 끌었던 주택복권은, 1983년 올림픽복권이 발행되면서 잠정 중단될 때까지 총 574회 발행되었고, 약 1,016억 원 규모가 판매되었다. 이를 통해 수해주택, 원호주택, 국가유공자 주택, 임대주택, 영세민주택 건설 등 약 4만 5천 호를 지원했다.\n90년대: 기다림은 가고 긁는 시대가 왔다\n1990년대 주택복권의 인기가 점차 시들해져 가던 무렵, 정부는 새로운 형태의 복권을 선보인다. 1990년 9월 1일, ‘엑스포 복권’이 등장한 것이다. 당시 정부는 1993년 대전세계박람회를 준비하고 있었는데 88서울올림픽 이후 처음으로 열리는 대규모 국제행사였다. 정부는 국민의 관심과 참여를 높이기 위해 ‘즉석 복권’이라는 아이디어를 꺼내 든다. 복권을 사고 일주일이나 기다릴 필요 없이 복권을 긁자마자 당첨 결과를 확인할 수 있는 새로운 방식이었다.\n최초의 즉석 복권인 엑스포 복권은 1990년부터 1993년까지 무려 3억 1,000장이 발행되었고, 총 415억 원의 판매 수익을 기록했다. 엑스포 복권이 성공하자, 여러 종류의 즉석 복권이 등장했는데 한 장을 사면 최대 6번이나 추첨할 수 있는 ‘또또복권’ 같은 새로운 컨셉의 복권도 이 시기에 등장한다.\n1998년 대한민국은 외환위기라는 초유의 사태를 겪어야만 했고, 복권 시장 역시 그 여파에서 자유롭지 못했다. 이 시기 정부 부처와 지자체는 복권 사업에 적극적이었다. 국토교통부의 주택복권, 과학기술정보통신부의 기술복권, 보건복지부의 엔젤복권 심지어 제주도의 관광복권 등 무려 21개의 부처나 지자체가 복권 사업에 참여한 것이다. 하지만 복권 사업 특혜 시비, 복권 기금 집행 문제 등 각종 문제가 발생며 복권에 대한 국민적 신뢰도는 추락하고 만다.\n2000년대: 407억 원 당첨자의 등장과 로또 열풍\n이러한 문제를 해결하고자 정부는 2002년 정부의 복권사업을 통합하고, 복권 기금의 엄정한 운영을 위한 복권위원회를 출범시켰다. 그 결과 ‘로또’가 등장하며 복권은 새로운 시대를 맞이한다. ‘인생 역전’을 내세우며 2002년 12월 등장한 ‘로또’는 그야말로 열풍을 일으켰다. 이전 복권과 달리 최고 당첨금액의 제한이 없다는 점 때문이었다. 로또가 발행된 지 몇 달 안 된 2003년 4월 제19회차의 1등 당첨자가 407억 원의 당첨금을 받게 되면서 당시 전국은 로또 열풍에 몸살을 앓았다. 수백, 수천만원의 돈을 들여서 복권 구매에 재산을 탕진하는 사람들까지 있었다.\n복권위원회의 조사*에 따르면, 성인 중  24.4%는 한 달에 한 번 로또복권을 구매한다고 한다. 로또를 살 때 50.5%는 5천 원 이하를, 34.3%는 5천 원에서 1만 원 사이를 지출해, 대체로 소액을 구매하는 편이다.\n*전국 만19세 이상 성인남녀 1,020명을 대상으로 2024년 실시\n로또복권의 판매액 역시 지난 10년간 꾸준히 상승해 왔다. 2013년 2조 9,896억 원이었던 판매액은 이후 매년 우상향 곡선을 그리며 늘어나, 2021년에는 5조 원을 돌파했고 2024년 상반기 기준으로는 5조 6,562억 원에 이르렀다. 판매액과 조사 결과를 보면, 로또 구매가 고정 소비 행위가 되었다는 사실을 확인할 수 있다.\n\n복권을 사는 마음은 사람마다 다를 것이다. 누군가는 일확천금을 바라고, 누군가는 그저 단순히 재미를 즐긴다. 하지만 개인의 기대와는 별개로, 복권은 오랫동안 국가 운영의 일부로 기능해 온 매우 정교한 시스템이다. 복권 수익금은 당첨자의 몫으로 모두 돌아가지 않는다. 우리가 복권 1,000원 어치를 사면, 그 중 410원이 복권기금으로 조성된다.  복권기금의 35%는 과학기술진흥기금, 중소기업창업 및 진흥기금 등 10개 법정배분기관에 법적으로 배분되며, 나머지 65%는 저소득층 임대주택 건설, 장애인·불우청소년 등 소외계층 지원 사업에 쓰이고 있다.\n복권의 사행성에 대한 비판이 고조될 때마다 복권의 공익적인 기능이 강조되지만, 더 섬세하게 들여다볼 필요가 있다. 복권 당첨 열풍과 그로 인한 중독과 상실감 등 사회적 후유증이 결코 적지 않기 때문이다.\n복권은 우연의 미학이다. ‘어쩌면’이라는 희박한 가능성을 사고파는 구조이고, 국가는 바로 이러한 ‘운’을 이용해 손쉽게 재정을 거둬들인다. 복권은 때로는 설레는 기대이지만, 지나치면 착각이 되고 중독이 되고 삶을 파멸로 몰고갈 수도 있다. 한 장의 복권은 가벼워야 한다. 복권에 인생을, 혹은 재정을 걸기 시작할 때부터 국민이건 정부 건 건강한 균형점을 잃어버리기 때문이다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호 윤자영",

TDS(토스 디자인 시스템)와 앱 빌더*를 활용해 토스의 제품 철학이 자동으로 적용되도록 설계했기 때문이에요.\n*앱 빌더는 토스의 내부 디자인 툴을 부르는 명칭으로, 앱인토스에서는 이러한 디자인 시스템을 직접 활용할 수 있어요. \n덕분에 파트너사가 별도로 토스의 제품 철학을 학습하지 않아도, 도구 자체에 토스 제품 디자이너들의 노하우와 원칙이 내재되어 파트너사의 서비스에 자연스럽게 구현됩니다.\n여기서 한 걸음 더 나아가, 각 직군이 필요로 하는 전문 도구들도 함께 제공해요. 기획자는 TUBA*를 통해 MVP 제작에 필요한 유저 테스트부터 빠른 이터레이션까지 시행할 수 있어요. 아침에 실험을 세팅하고 저녁에 결과를 즉시 확인하며 제품 개선 과정을 체계적으로 진행할 수 있죠.\n*TUBA란 Toss User Behavior Analyzer의 축약어로, 토스 유저 행동 분석 툴이라는 의미예요. 토스의 유저 행동을 데이터로 분석할 수 있는 토스 내부 인프라입니다. 아래 이미지처럼 직접 캠페인을 세팅하고 푸시를 보내는데 활용할 수도 있어요.\n\n엔지니어는 토스가 제공하는 SDK(개발 도구 모음)와 다양한 개발 인프라를 활용해 기존보다 훨씬 쉽게 구현할 수 있고요. 마케터라면 직접 2,900만 유저 중 서비스에 적합한 타겟을 설정하고 푸시를 발송할 수도 있어요. 동시에 유저 리텐션, 퍼널 전환율, 코호트 분석 등 다양한 지표를 수집해 데이터 기반 의사 결정까지 가능합니다. \n이 결과 토스 유저들은 앱 구석구석에서 미니앱을 만날 수가 있습니다. 구체적으로는 ‘전체’ 탭에 있는 게임 홈, 미니앱 홈은 물론 토스 서비스 맥락과 닿아 있는 서비스 화면이나 관련 검색어 입력 시에도 파트너사의 서비스를 만나고 이용할 수 있게 되죠. \n\n또한 초기 서비스, 스타트업들이 가장 어려워하는 고객 획득 과정(AARRR) 단계에서 앱 다운로드와 회원 가입, 결제수단 등록과 같은 과정을 토스 인증과 토스페이로 한번에 해결할 수 있습니다.\n“실제로 유저 인터뷰를 해보면 ‘멤버십 혜택은 좋은데, 초반에 설치하고 로그인하는 과정이 번거로워서 이용을 망설이는’ 경우가 있다고 해요. 이런 유저들을 잡고 싶은 파트너에게 특히 앱인토스가 유용할 것으로 생각합니다.” - 제품팀 권순우 \n앱인토스에서 유저가 서비스를 발견하는 방식을 설계할 때 가장 중요하게 고려한 점은 바로 유저의 편의성과 서비스로의 즉각적인 전환이었습니다. 이를 위해 서비스를 소개할 때 브랜드명보다 기능 설명을 먼저 배치하는 전략을 택했어요.\n이는 토스의 핵심 제품 철학 중 하나인 ‘Value First, Cost Later’ 원칙을 구현한 것이에요. 유저가 얻을 수 있는 가치를 먼저 명확히 제시하여 즉각적인 전환을 유도하는 앱인토스만의 설계 철학이죠.\n파트너사의 브랜드 성장도 함께 고려합니다. 유저가 미니앱 이용 시 해당 브랜드로 이동한다는 안내가 명확히 표시되고, 재사용 시에는 브랜드명이 우선 노출되어 브랜드 인지도 향상에도 기여해요.\n\n이처럼 앱인토스 팀은 파트너사가 진짜 필요로 하는 것을 깊이 이해하기 위해, 끊임없이 탐색합니다. 파트너사들이 그로스 차원에서 고민하는 것과 실제 과정을 이해하기 위해 정기적으로 그룹 인터뷰를 진행하고, 파트너사와의 직접적인 소통을 통해 해상도 높은 니즈 파악을 위해 노력해요.\n개인부터 기업까지 \n모두 성장할 수 있어요\n앱인토스는 현재 1인 개발자부터 이름만 들으면 아는 브랜드까지 다양한 규모의 파트너사가 함께 하고 있어요. 규모를 불문하고 모든 파트너가 성장할 수 있는 환경을 제공하고 있기 때문입니다.\n1인 개발자와 초기 스타트업에게는 앱인토스가 강력한 성장 동력이 됩니다. 일반적으로 해당 규모에서 구축하기 어려운 마케팅 도구와 데이터 분석 시스템, 결제 인프라를 제품 초기부터 활용할 수 있거든요.\n중간 규모의 기업에게는 효율적인 실험 환경을 제공합니다. 새로운 서비스나 기능을 테스트할 때 필요한 복잡한 준비 과정과 초기 비용 부담 없이, 빠르게 시장 검증을 진행할 수 있어요.\n이미 시장에서 인지도가 있는 브랜드에게는 새로운 추가 매출의 기회를 제공합니다. 파트너사는 앱인토스 내에서 자체적으로 인앱 결제를 통한 유료 서비스나 광고를 운영할 수 있어 추가적인 매출 창출이 가능합니다.\n이처럼 토스가 앱인토스를 통해 그리고 있는 건 단순한 미니앱 플랫폼이 아닙니다. 좋은 아이디어를 가진 사람이라면 누구나, 규모와 상관없이 성공할 수 있는 기회를 만들고자 합니다.\n이미 앱인토스를 적극적으로 활용하며 좋은 성과를 얻은 사례도 있어요. 해외 송금 전문 핀테크 기업 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}‘모인’은 신규 가입자가 약 40% 증가하고, 부동산 인공지능 에이전트 서비스 기업인 ‘안전집사’는 앱인토스에서 서비스 출시 후 유저 트래픽의 90%가 앱인토스로 발생하는 결과도 얻게 되었어요.\n‘앱인토스만으로 IPO까지’\n토스가 그리는 앱인토스의 미래 \n\"앱인토스와 함께하는 파트너사들이 앱인토스만으로 기업 공개(IPO)까지 성공했으면 좋겠어요.\" - 제품팀 권순우\n앱인토스는 메이커들이 성장할 수 있는 최적의 환경을 조성하고, 그들의 성공이 곧 토스의 성공으로 이어지는 구조를 만들고 있습니다.\n더 나아가 유튜브 서비스가 활성화 되며 자연스럽게 크리에이터를 돕는 회사나 지원 서비스가 생겨났듯, 앱인토스 파트너사를 돕는 2차 사업자들이 자연스럽게 등장하는 완전한 생태계를 기대하고 있어요. 그때야 비로소 진정한 성장 생태계가 완성되는 거죠.\n현재는 여정의 첫 단계에 불과하지만, 토스는 이 비전을 빠르게 현실로 만들어낼 계획입니다. 기존 글로벌 성공 사례를 비춰보았을 때 성숙한 미니앱 생태계가 구축되는 데 약 5년이 걸렸는데, 토스는 더 빠른 속도로 그 목표를 달성하기 위해 전력으로 노력 중이에요.\n2,900만 유저에게 \n여러분의 서비스를 선보일 준비가 되셨나요?\n현재 앱인토스는 베타 서비스를 통해 다양한 파트너사를 모집하고 있습니다. 게임부터 생활 서비스까지 다양한 분야의 좋은 아이디어가 있다면 누구나 도전할 수 있어요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nGraphic 이은호 이제현",

원·달러 환율에 신경 쓸 일이 많지 않았습니다. 하지만 최근 몇 년 사이 미국 주식 투자자가 급격히 늘어나면서 자연스럽게 환율에 관한 관심도 높아졌죠. 환율이 낮을 때 환전하면 수익률 측면에서 유리하기 때문입니다.\n미국 주식과 같이 ‘달러(USD)’로 표시된 금융 자산에 투자하는 것을 달러 자산 투자라고 부릅니다. 그렇다면 왜 달러에 투자할까요? 달러는 글로벌 기축통화✱로, 전 세계적으로 수요가 많은 자산입니다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}각국의 중앙은행은 국제 결제, 환율 안정, 금융위기 대응을 위해 달러 자산을 보유하고, 기업이나 개인은 무역, 투자, 송금 등의 목적으로 달러 자산이 필요합니다. 즉, 달러는 전 세계에 수요가 있는 기축통화로서 신뢰할 수 있는 투자 대상으로 평가받는 것이죠.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✱기축통화: 국제 외환 시장에서 금융 거래, 결제, 자산 보유 등의 중심이 되는 통화를 뜻합니다. 대표적으로 미국 달러가 이에 속해요. 더 자세한 내용은 ‘.css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}미국 달러, 어떻게 기축통화가 됐을까?’를 참고하세요.\n달러 자산 투자는 단순히 달러가 저렴할 때 사고 비쌀 때 팔아서 차익을 노리는 환테크뿐 아니라, 미국 주식, 채권, ETF(상장지수펀드), REITs(부동산 투자신탁), 달러 예금 등에 이르는 투자 방식을 포괄합니다.\n달러 자산 투자에 관심 가져야 하는 이유\n큰 수익률을 보이는 특정 종목들 때문에 미국 주식 투자를 시작하는 경우가 많지만, 근본적으로 우리는 왜 달러 자산 투자에 관심을 가질까요? 한마디로 정리하면, 원화 중심으로 구성된 자산 포트폴리오에 달러 자산을 일부 편입함으로써 통화 분산 효과를 얻고 글로벌 투자 기회를 넓힐 수 있기 때문입니다. 이는 한국 자산을 대체한다기보다 보완적 접근이라고 할 수 있죠.\n① 인플레이션과 원화 가치 하락 방어 효과\n요즘 물가가 오르고 있다는 걸 체감하고 계시죠? 마트에서 사는 과일도, 밖에서 사먹는 냉면 한 그릇도 훌쩍 높아진 가격으로 우리를 놀라게 합니다. 이처럼 예전과 같은 물건이나 서비스라도 가격을 더 줘야 하는 현상을 인플레이션이라고 합니다.\n인플레이션이 발생하는 첫 번째 이유는 시중에 돈이 너무 많이 풀렸기 때문입니다. 정부가 침체된 내수 경기를 활성화시키기 위해 돈을 계속 풀면, 그만큼 돈의 가치는 떨어지고 물가는 오르게 돼요. 둘째, 중동의 지정학적 리스크로 유가가 상승한 탓에 전반적으로 물가가 오르고 있습니다. 셋째, 원화 가치가 낮아졌기 때문입니다. 우리나라 경제가 불안해지거나, 정치·외교적인 이슈가 생기면 → 외국 투자자들이 원화를 팔고 빠져나가서 → 환율이 올라가고 → 수입하는 원자재나 물품 가격이 비싸지면서 → 물가도 덩달아 오르게 됩니다.\n이럴 때 달러 자산은 큰 효과를 발휘합니다. 내 자산의 일부를 달러 자산으로 보유하고 있으면 원화 가치가 떨어지더라도 전체 자산의 가치를 방어할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 전 재산을 원화로만 가지고 있는 사람은 인플레이션이 올 때 실질 자산 가치가 줄어들지만, 달러 자산 비중을 일부 확보한 경우 환율 변동이 손실을 일부 상쇄해 줄 가능성이 있으니까요.\n② 글로벌 분산 투자\n한국 경제는 저성장·고령화 등 구조적 변화를 겪고 있는 가운데, 글로벌 교역 환경과 통상 정책 변수에 따라 산업별 기회와 리스크가 동시에 존재합니다. 이런 상황에서 우리가 가진 자산 대부분이 원화로만 묶여 있다면 위험할 수 있습니다. 부동산도 원화 자산이고, 월급도 원화로 받고, 예금도 원화로 넣잖아요. 그런데 만약 원화 가치가 떨어지거나 우리 경제가 위태로운 시기가 오면 우리 자산 전체가 함께 흔들리게 됩니다. \n이럴 때 떠올릴 수 있는 것이 글로벌 분산 투자입니다. ‘달걀을 한 바구니에 담지 말라’는 말처럼 자산을 여러 나라에 투자할 필요가 있습니다. 그중에서도 달러 자산은 미국이라는 가장 큰 경제 시장에 투자할 수 있는 대표적인 방법입니다. 무턱대고 한국 자산을 줄이기보다는 전체 포트폴리오에서 지역·통화 다변화를 고려해 보자는 취지입니다.\n③ 환차익 기대\n원·달러 환율은 오르락내리락을 반복합니다. 긴 흐름으로 보면 달러가 원화보다 강했던 시기가 여러 번 있었고, 그때 ‘환차익’을 얻을 수도 있었습니다. 앞으로도 성장률 차이, 글로벌 자금 이동, 지정학 변수 등에 따라 달러 강세가 나타날 수 있지만, 이는 어디까지나 가능성일 뿐 확정된 미래는 아닙니다.\n여기서 환차익이란, 쉽게 말해 달러 가격이 오를 때 생기는 이익을 말합니다. 예를 들어, 1달러가 1,200원일 때 투자해서 1,400원이 되었을 때 달러를 팔면 200원만큼 환차익을 얻을 수 있으며, 현재 환차익에 대해 세금은 부과되지 않습니다.\n④ 장기적인 자산 증식\n미국 주식 시장은 역사적으로 장기적인 성장 추세를 보여왔습니다. 대공황, 1·2차 세계 대전, 2008년 금융위기, 코로나19 팬데믹 같은 큰 충격이 있어도 이내 회복세를 보였고, 결국엔 더 크게 성장했습니다. 이건 단순한 운이 아니라 미국이라는 나라의 시스템과 기업 생태계에 대한 신뢰가 있기 때문에 가능한 일이었죠. \n실제로 미국 대형주를 대표하는 S&P 500 지수는 지난 수십 년간 연평균 약 7~10%의 수익률을 기록해 왔습니다. 다만 과거 수익률이 미래를 보장하지 않는다는 점, 투자 시점에 따라 수익률이 크게 달라질 수 있다는 점을 유의해야 합니다.\n달러 자산 투자에 대해 궁금한 5가지\nQ1. 언제 사고팔아야 하나요?\n→ 시장은 언제 오르고 내릴지 예측하기 어렵습니다. 따라서 단기적인 가격 변동에 일희일비하기보다는 장기적인 관점에서 꾸준히 투자하는 것이 중요합니다. 만약 비용 평균법✱을 활용해 정기적으로 일정 금액을 투자하면, 환율과 시장의 변동성 리스크를 분산할 수 있습니다. 시장의 타이밍을 맞추려 하기보다는 시장에 지속적으로 참가하는 것이 더 나은 투자 결과로 이어질 가능성이 높습니다.\n✱비용 평균법(Cost Averaging): 일정 금액을 정기적으로 투자해 시장 변동성을 완화하고 평균 매입 단가를 낮추는 전략\nQ2. 초보자는 어떤 달러 자산에 투자하는 게 좋을까요?\n→ 투자자의 위험 선호도와 목표에 따라 선택이 달라집니다. 안정성을 추구한다면 미국 국채나 배당주 ETF(예: SCHD, SPYD, VYM)가 적합합니다. 성장성을 원한다면 기술주 중심의 ETF(예: QQQ)나 개별 주식(예: 엔비디아, 테슬라, 메타 등)에 투자할 수 있습니다. 초보자는 S&P500 지수 ETF(예: VOO, SPY)처럼 시장 전반을 추종하는 상품을 선택하는 것이 더 잘 맞을 수 있고요.\nQ3. 달러의 기축통화 지위가 약화되고 있는 것은 아닌가요?\n→ 중국과 일본이 미국 국채를 매도하고 '탈달러' 움직임을 보이는 등 달러 패권에 대한 의구심이 제기되기도 합니다. 그러나 아직은 달러를 대체할 만큼 신뢰받는 자산이 마땅치 않아 미국의 대체 불가능한 지위는 당분간 유지될 가능성이 높습니다.\nQ4. 달러 자산도 변동성이 높은데 괜찮을까요?\n→ 모든 투자에는 위험이 따릅니다. 원금 보장 상품이 아닌 이상 시장의 변동성은 자연스러운 현상입니다. 중요한 것은 단기적인 변동에 흔들리지 않고 장기적인 성장 가능성을 믿고 투자하는 것이겠죠. 개인 투자자는 분산 투자와 적립식 투자를 통해 리스크를 관리하고 심리적 불안을 줄이는 것이 필요합니다.\nQ5. 미국 주식 투자 시 어떤 비용이 드나요?\n→ 미국 주식에 투자할 때 발생하는 주요 비용은 거래 수수료, 환전 수수료, 그리고 세금 등이 있습니다.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

또는 달러 RP\n소극적으로 달러 자산 보유를 원한다면 주식 투자보다 달러 예금 또는 달러RP가 잘 맞을 수 있어요.\n\n달러 예금: 말 그대로 달러로 예치하는 예금 상품입니다. 은행에 달러 통장을 만들어 일정 기간 달러를 예치하면 이자를 받을 수 있죠. 안정성이 높고 원금 보장이 된다는 게 가장 큰 특징입니다.\n달러 RP(환매조건부채권): RP는 증권사가 보유한 국공채 등을 담보로 단기적으로 달러를 맡기고 약정한 수익률을 받는 투자 상품입니다. 예금보다는 약간 위험이 따르지만, 금리가 예금보다 높고 짧은 기간 운용이 가능해 자금 회전에 유리합니다. 단, 원금 보장이 되지 않으며 원금 손실 가능성도 존재합니다.\n\n(2) 미국 국채에 투자하기\n미국 국채에 가장 쉽게 투자하는 방법은 증권사 앱의 ‘해외채권’ 메뉴를 이용하는 것입니다. 1년, 2년, 10년 등 원하는 만기와 금리를 확인하고 채권을 매수하면 됩니다. 최근 몇 년간 단기 미국 국채 금리가 국내 단기 예금 대비 경쟁력 있는 수준을 보였던 시기가 있었으나, 금리 수준은 시점에 따라 크게 달라지므로 거래 직전 확인이 필수입니다.\n또 다른 방법으로는 미국 국채 ETF에 투자하는 것이 있습니다. 대표적인 ETF로는 TLT(장기), IEF(중기), SHY(단기) 등이 있죠. 보통 장기채는 금리 변화에 민감해 변동성이 크고, 단기채는 비교적 안정적인 편이기 때문에 자신의 투자 목적과 성향에 맞게 선택하는 것이 중요합니다.\n※ 채권은 만기까지 보유하면 원금과 이자를 받을 수 있지만, 중간에 매도할 경우에는 손실을 볼 수 있으므로 유의해야 합니다.\n달러 자산 투자는 단순한 수익 추구를 넘어 변화무쌍한 글로벌 경제 속에서 나의 자산을 지키고 성장시킬 수 있는 전략적 선택지입니다. 그러니 단기적인 시장 변동에 연연하기보다는 자신에게 맞는 투자 원칙을 세우고 꾸준히 실행하는 것이 중요합니다. 분산 투자와 적립식 투자를 통해 위험을 관리하고, 장기적인 안목으로 시장의 큰 흐름을 읽어 나간다면 분명 달러 자산은 전체 포트폴리오의 보완재 역할을 해줄 것입니다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호\n해당 콘텐츠는 2025.07.25.
