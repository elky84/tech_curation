        "content:encodedSnippet": "In the latest releases of the C++ Extension in Visual Studio Code, we have focused on performance improvements and stability. A fast, responsive, and reliable development environment is essential for maintaining productivity, especially in large and complex C++ projects. These updates include many incremental optimizations that collectively speed up the time from opening a C++ project to writing code with the full suite of C++ features available at your fingertips. Experience these new features for yourself by updating to the newest version of the C++ Extension. \nFaster Project Startup and Time to Colorization \nMany different optimizations have been made in the C++ extension to provide better initialization performance on project startup and when configuring IntelliSense. If you’re working on a large or complex project on a MacOS or Linux machine, you’ll notice a significant improvement.  \nThrough our testing, we found an average 3.4x speedup on Linux and 3.6x speedup on MacOS . Testing was done with a basic machine using VS Code 1.97.1 and the PyTorch source code. \n \nWhen opening a source file, semantic highlighting (colorization) is also now much faster. This change is due to the C++ Extension now caching configuration information rather than relying on real-time processing, resulting in much faster configuration access.  \nBased on our testing, we found an average 4x speedup in the time to file colorization, 4.8x for Linux, and 3.3x for MacOS. This testing was done using VS Code 1.97.1 on a basic machine and colorizing a representative file in the PyTorch source code.  \n\nOptimizing IntelliSense Configuration \nIntelliSense is the core of the C++ Extension, building your coding experience into a dynamic process with real-time analysis and insights. This ranges from autocompletion to file navigation like “Go to Definition”. But in order for IntelliSense to be able to provide this information, it must understand your project’s configuration. Configuration details, such as compiler settings and include paths, are parsed on project startup.  \nWith this release, we optimized the IntelliSense configuration process. The biggest change is that compiler configurations are now cached. A quick retrieval via the database is much faster than identifying and querying the correct compiler every time a project is opened. This leads to faster population of IntelliSense features as seen in the previous section for time to colorization. \nWe have optimized further by parallelizing different processes during file discovery. For example, determining the relationship between source and header files and lookups of different #include files now happen in parallel, providing faster results. Additionally, an updated path canonicalization process for MacOS and Linux uses better path resolutions to standardize file paths. This eliminates redundancies like relative components, reduces file system access, and improves performance across the different operating systems.  \nBeyond configuring with a compiler, we also optimized the process of using alternate methods for configuration, such as custom configurations. It is now faster to reconfigure a custom configuration provider, and the selected C++ configuration can also now be easily switched within the extension. Switching a configuration is available via a new parameter thanks to the work of @adrianstephens.  \nWe have also expanded support for configuring your project via a compile_commands.json file. A project can now support multiple compile_command.json file, thanks to the contributions of @yiftahw. This makes it easier for build systems that run CMake separately in different repositories to be able to specify which CMake version to use via multiple separate compile_commands files. Additionally, there is now faster processing of large and complex compile_commands.json files, especially for files with thousands of entries. Combined with the new configuration caching, this creates a better startup experience.  \nOther Enhancements \nBeyond startup time and IntelliSense improvements, we’ve introduced additional enhancements to improve performance and usability:  \nAn improved implementation of file buffers, reducing memory usage while using the extension\nAdditional settings have been added to the C/C++: Log Diagnostics output for more details on the environment setup and configuration, including modified C_Cpp settings, additionally tracked settings, and the database path used.  \nTo learn more about these changes, please reference the changelog.  \nWhat do you think? \nDownload the C/C++ extension for Visual Studio Code  today, give it a try, and let us know what you think.   \nIf you have any questions around this release, feel free to start a discussion in our GitHub repository.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nCreating a new CMake project that uses unfamiliar libraries can be daunting and time-consuming. This blog post takes you along on my journey using Copilot to make this easier, and leveraging Custom Instructions to tailor Copilot responses. For a sneak peek, see the outcome of this journey in this repository.\nBackground\nAs C++ developers who use Copilot every day, we’ve experienced how it can improve our day-to-day productivity. Copilot really shines in scenarios like new codebases or unfamiliar topics, significantly reducing ramp-up. There are multiple ways to engage with it in Visual Studio, including Completions and Copilot Chat. This blog is focused on leveraging Copilot Chat to be more productive.\nWhat project should I create?\nBeing a maintainer of the CMake experience, I have always been aware of a popular computer vision library, OpenCV, that is built on CMake to power 2500+ algorithms. However, I’ve never actually played with it and used it in my own code. The first idea that came to mind, being a dog-lover myself, was to create my own real-time dog detector using OpenCV. I set out to create a Dog Detector using CMake and Copilot in Visual Studio.\nImport OpenCV into CMake Project\nStarting with a new CMake Project in Visual Studio, the first problem to solve was: “How do I import OpenCV into my CMake project?”. Using CMake can sometimes be complex, and I wanted to make sure I used OpenCV in a cross-platform way, so to figure out how to do this, I asked Copilot.\n\nCopilot was able to give me CMakeLists.txt modifications that I can make to my project. However, you’ll notice that it mentions that OpenCV must be installed and that I can use vcpkg. Vcpkg is a cross-platform C/C++ package manager.\nPrior to doing this, while the suggested CMakeLists.txt changes are correct, CMake fails the configure step with an error indicating that OpenCV cannot be found. This is because I haven’t yet installed OpenCV.\nUse vcpkg to install OpenCV\nNow, how do I take Copilot’s suggestion to use vcpkg to install OpenCV? Let’s ask Copilot.\nCopilot gave the following response:\n\nYou’ll notice that it gave only command-line suggestions for how to install OpenCV with vcpkg. Our team typically uses vcpkg in manifest mode and I’d prefer to use that. Also, you’ll notice that Copilot suggested a CMake command line. We are in Visual Studio, so the command line is driven by our CMake Presets file, and I’d rather make modifications there.\nLet’s ask Copilot again with those requests in mind.\n Hm, wouldn’t it be nice if I didn’t have to specify manifest mode?\nIt would also be nice if I didn’t have to specify that I prefer using CMakePresets.json when I ask Copilot questions? \n\n \nThese suggestions are much more aligned with what I’d like to do in my project. Following a combination of the Copilot suggestions and this documentation, I did the following:\nInstalled vcpkg and ran the bootstrap script.\nCreated the necessary vcpkg.json and vcpkg-configuration.json files defining opencv as a dependency.\nModified the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE using the CMakePresets file.\nAt this point, we were closer, but we still failed to configure. After asking Copilot for help, I realized that it wasn’t finding the toolchain file, and that I should specify the VCPKG_ROOT in an environment variable in the preset and use that variable in the CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE setting to successfully find it.\nAt this point, CMake configured successfully and OpenCV had been included in my CMake project.\nUse OpenCV to detect dogs\nNow that OpenCV was properly included in my CMake project, the next step was to figure out how to use the library and how to get it to detect dogs. From my little background knowledge of OpenCV, I knew that it would need a model trained to detect certain objects. To start, I asked Copilot if OpenCV can detect dogs already, and it told me that there were already publicly available models and, upon further questioning, pointed me to some links where I could download configuration files, weights files, and class names from this repository.\nNow that I had downloaded models I could use, I asked Copilot to give me a code snippet that would allow me to detect dogs.\nOne thing that I hit errors on and had to modify was that Copilot suggested relative paths, and this didn’t work, since it was running the executable from the build location. I found it easier to always use absolute paths to make this simpler.\n\nIt would be great if I could tell Copilot to always use absolute paths.\nAfter modifying the paths, I was able to detect dogs in images!\n\nSwitch to livestream\nI didn’t want to only be able to detect dogs in images, I also wanted to be able to detect dogs using a livestream. I went back to Copilot and asked it to help me make these changes: “How can I modify this code to livestream from a camera rather than reading a single image?”.\nCopilot was able to suggest slight modifications to the code, and I was able to integrate a while loop and slightly modify the camera capture mechanism to accomplish this. See the original code versus the suggested livestream code below.\n\nTo my surprise, the model could detect other objects as well.\n\nAdd UI\nTo make a more well-rounded application, I wanted to add a user interface to make it easier to control what models are used and to make it easier to operate overall. Through some conversations with Copilot, I was able to add qt5 as a vcpkg.json dependency and add components that allow you to select the .cfg, the .weights, the class names file, and to start and stop the livestream.\nThe below partial screenshot shows the initial suggestions that copilot gave:\n\nAfter refining the UI with more conversation with UI and code improvements, the pictures below show The Dog Detector when the camera isn’t on versus when it is.\n\nAlso, the ultimate test was to test out the “Dog Detector” with my dog.\n\nBuild the project statically\nFinally, I wanted to be able to share the executable of this project easily with others so that they could use this project without having to worry about the runtime, the build process, etc. To do this, I asked Copilot: “How to statically link a library with CMake and vcpkg?”\n\nCopilot gave a suggestion to set the vcpkg triplet, but it gave suggestions to modify it in CMakeLists.txt or in the command line. To get better suggestions, I asked again, adding that we want to modify the CMakePresets.json.\nThis is another instance where it’d be nice to not have to specify this every time I ask.\nI took these suggestions and modified them to use CMakePresets.json, so I set the VCPKG_TRIPLET_TARGET in CMakePresets.json.\nWith these changes, configuration succeeded, but I still got the following build errors:\nmismatch detected for ‘RuntimeLibrary’: value ‘MTd_StaticDebug’ doesn’t match value ‘MDd_DynamicDebug’ in DogDetector.cpp.obj.\nTo help me fix this problem, I asked Copilot to help. Copilot told me to ensure I set the variable OpenCV_STATIC to ON. Since this variable is specific to only the target that includes OpenCV, I set this in the CMakeLists.txt. Additionally, CMake told me that I should set the CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY to MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>. However, after making these changes, I was still getting the error.\nAfter much conversation with Copilot, I realized it may have something to do with CMake Policies associated with the CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY. Looking at the documentation, the variable only takes effect when the CMP0091 policy is set to “new”, which is only “new” by default in version 3.15 and beyond.\nIt would have been great to be informed about CMake Policies that affect CMake variables that Copilot suggested I use.\nAfter updating the CMake project to have a minimum required version of 3.15, the project built statically with no errors.\nCustom Instructions\nAfter completing the project, looking back at all the questions and interactions I had with Copilot through Copilot Chat, there were many times where I thought, “Hm, it would be great if I didn’t have to continually specify this information in each question.”. You may have noticed this internal dialog above.\nTo solve this, I used the Copilot Custom Instructions feature. This feature allows you to create a .github/copilot-instructions.md file that contains additional context you want to be added to every question that you ask Copilot Chat.\nBased on the various observations I made, I created a copilot-instructions.md file and added the following custom instructions:\nThis project uses vcpkg in manifest mode. Please keep this in mind when giving vcpkg suggestions. Do not provide suggestions like vcpkg install library, as they will not work as expected.\nPrefer setting cache variables and other types of things through CMakePresets.json if possible.\nGive information about any CMake Policies that might affect CMake variables that are suggested or mentioned.\nThis project needs to be cross-platform and cross-compiler for MSVC, Clang, and GCC.\nWhen providing OpenCV samples that use the file system to read files, please always use absolute file paths rather than file names, or relative file paths. For example, use video.open(\"C:/project/file.mp4\"), not video.open(\"file.mp4\")\nAfter adding this file, it was immediately obvious that answers were better when asking the same questions that had been asked previously. For example, I created a new project again and asked how I should use vcpkg to use OpenCV with CMake, and this is part of the response I received.\n\nI was able to repeat the process of creating this project, and by utilizing the Custom Instructions feature, it took me far fewer iterations with Copilot to get answers that I wanted when asking questions related to the custom instructions.\nConclusion\nBy utilizing the CMake experience along with Copilot in Visual Studio, I was able to quickly get a Dog Detector program up and running, complete with vcpkg integration, an easy-to-use UI, and static linking to share the executable.\nI was also able to use the Custom Instructions feature provided by Copilot to make my conversations more useful without having to provide as much repetitive, contextual information in each message to Copilot.\nCopilot helped me speed up my development process by answering my questions and helping me navigate CMake and vcpkg. Custom instructions helped Copilot provide more relevant and straightforward answers, without me having to take the time to provide additional context in every question.\nTo play with the Dog Detector yourself, you can find the source code here, which is released as a sample under MIT license on GitHub.\nDisclaimer\nThe screenshots and responses from Copilot shown above may vary. There is no guarantee that if you attempt to replicate this blog post you will get the same responses.\nAuthor & Team\nCMake is a widely adopted cross-platform build system that plays a crucial role in modern C++ development.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Over the past 5 years, we’ve had many incredible opportunities to engage with game developers. From AAA studios to indie developers, the passion for slashing iteration times is significant. Amidst all the fantastic feedback we’ve received for Visual Studio, one sentiment has rung loud and clear: a desire to debug optimized C++ code without sacrificing performance. Although game developers have voiced this need the loudest, we know that solving this issue will benefit many other C++ workflows. While we’ve consistently rolled out many productivity and performance enhancements over the years, debugging optimized code has always been at the top of everyone’s wish list.\nCurrent Issues with Debugging Optimized Code\nThrough our conversations with game developers, we’ve heard about some common problems when debugging optimized code:\nTrying to inspect locals often yields the “Variable is optimized away” message in the watch window.\nStep-over and step-into don’t always step over, or into, the expected code paths.\nLosing time while iterating with #pragma optimize to try and undo optimizations, requiring a rebuild and restart of the debugger.\nThanks to your feedback, the team has been hard at work to come up with a creative solution.\nAnnouncing: C++ Dynamic Debugging\nWe are thrilled to announce that C++ Dynamic Debugging is now available as a preview feature exclusively with the MSVC toolset. This feature dynamically deoptimizes code that you set breakpoints on or step into, giving you the performance of optimized code with the debugging experience of unoptimized code.\nTry C++ Dynamic Debugging today in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 Preview 2.\nDownload\n\nWithout C++ Dynamic Debugging\nWith C++ Dynamic Debugging\n“The new feature is exceptional. I now have reliable stepwise debugging, variable inspection, and program counter jumping without needing to recompile with pragma optimize.”\n– Jess Kube, Principal Software Engineer, The Coalition\nUsing it daily, the new feature improved my ability to debug and investigate quicker. I don’t need to manually deoptimize my files anymore”\n– Matthew Koch, Principal Software Engineer, Halo Studios\n“With the new feature, breakpoints in inlined functions will now be hit. Previously, I had to use a debug build or #pragma optimize and remember to remove it before code review”\n– Keith Stockdale, Senior Software Engineer, Rare\n\nGetting Started with C++ Dynamic Debugging\nYou only need a few short clicks to turn on C++ Dynamic Debugging for your project. After activating these options, you must rebuild to start using C++ Dynamic Debugging.\nMSBuild C++ Projects\nTo begin, change your configuration to Release mode. Next, right-click on your project and click on Properties to open the Configuration Properties menu. In this menu, click on Advanced > Use C++ Dynamic Debugging > Yes. Lastly, rebuild your project.\nSetting this property will turn off Whole Program Optimization.\nConfiguration Properties\nOther Build Systems\nPass the new /dynamicdeopt switch to cl.exe, lib.exe, and link.exe\nFor Unreal Engine developers, UE 5.6 will support the bDynamicDebugging Windows platform flag.\nPlease see documentation for more details.\nSystem Requirements\nVisual Studio 2022 Version 17.14 Preview 2\nMSVC Toolset 19.44\nX64 architecture\nNot compatible with LTCG, PGO, OPT-ICF flags\nUsing C++ Dynamic Debugging\nTurning on C++ Dynamic Debugging and rebuilding unlocks familiar debugging patterns for optimized code without compromising on performance.\nBreakpoints\nYour breakpoints will get hit in deoptimized code. Look for the [Deoptimized] tag in the Call Stack window to know that you can view all your locals.\nConditional and Dependent Breakpoints\nSet Conditional and Dependent Breakpoints as if the code was unoptimized; you can add conditional breakpoints to variables that have been optimized away in your optimized binaries.\nStepping Actions\nStep Over to the next line of your source code as if the code was unoptimized.\nStepping Actions\nStep In to any function, and those functions will be deoptimized as well. In addition, Step In will now step into __forceinline functions.\nStep Into __forceinline functions\nSet Next Statement\nUsing Set Next Statement in a deoptimized frame works as if the code was unoptimized.\nSet Next Statement\nCall Stack Window\nIn your Call Stack window, you will see that any frames that have been deoptimized will have a [deoptimized] tag.\nCall Stack Window\nVisual Studio only deoptimizes the frame corresponding to your breakpoint or functions stepped into. Frames higher up in the call stack remain optimized for performance. You can select additional frames in the Call Stack window and click “Deoptimize on next entry” to deoptimize those functions when they are entered the next time.\n\nManaging “Deoptimize on next entry” breakpoints\nBreakpoints added through “Deoptimize on next entry” are listed in the Breakpoints window. You can export these Breakpoints for later use. To return your application to full optimization, delete these breakpoints.\nDeoptimized Breakpoints\nMiddleware Support\nWe have been working closely with our middleware partners to ensure that C++ Dynamic Debugging works with popular middleware tools.\nUnreal Engine\nIn Unreal Engine version 5.6, Unreal Build Tool and Unreal Build Accelerator will support C++ Dynamic Debugging natively. To try the feature today, please manually apply the change, temporarily disable Unreal Build Accelerator, and see our documentation for more details.\nIncrediBuild\nIncrediBuild 10.24 or later supports C++ Dynamic Debugging.\nFastBuild\nTo use C++ Dynamic Debugging with FastBuild, please see this Pull Request.\nXbox GDK\nOut-of-the-box support for C++ Dynamic Debugging will be available in an April 2025 update. To try this feature today, please refer to the official GDK documentation.\nOverhead Considerations\nWhile using C++ Dynamic Debugging, it’s important to acknowledge the following considerations. Despite these overhead costs, we are confident that your overall iteration time will benefit significantly.\nFile Output Size\nIn our assessments, using a modified version of the Lyra Sample project, we observed a 2.4x increase in the build output size.\nBuild Time\nEnd-to-end Build Time\nDepending on the project, we saw an increase in end-to-end build time ranging from 1.05x to 1.15x.\nIteration Build Time\nFor small and medium-sized binaries, the increase in iteration build time was less than 1.2x. For larger binaries, such as monolithic games, the increase was up to 1.8x.\nMitigations for Iteration Build Time\nIf the increase in iteration time is too burdensome for large binaries, you can try the undocumented /d2DDTrimInlines compiler switch. This switch, subject-to-change and removal, reduces the iteration time overhead from 1.8x to 1.4x at the cost of increased end-to-end build time. The switch also removes the ability to step into small __forceinline/inline functions.\nKnown Issues\nBy design:\nUnexpected PDB error, LIMIT (12), check for insufficient disk space, invalid path, or insufficient privilege.\nStepping in disassembly window remains optimized.\nFixed in Visual Studio 2022 17.4 Preview 3:\nCrash with memcmp and other intrinsic imports with /MD\nIncorrect emission of C4714\nMissing feature from x86_x64 compiler\nInstrumentation-based profiling doesn’t work\nCrash stepping past C++ exception catch handlers\nActive Issues:\nStarting the debugger with F10 or F11 keeps main() optimized\nImageBase is 0 when debugging\nCrash stepping into __try block that has access violation\nConclusion\nTry C++ Dynamic Debugging today: Experience the benefits of debug builds and the speed of optimized builds.\nDownload\n\nC++ Dynamic Debugging is a preview feature. Thank you to everyone who gave us feedback on debugging optimized code. This feature would not have been possible without your feedback. We love to hear how much time this feature has saved you and how you’re incorporating it into your workflow. Furthermore, we invite you to keep sending feedback so we can make C++ Dynamic Debugging even better.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In our previous blog posts (1,2), we created integration tests that interact with UI components and assert different properties of UI components. However, sometimes we need to check the internal state of our plugin or invoke some method to simplify or speed up the test and avoid too many UI interactions. Let’s explore exactly how we can do this.\nJava Management Extension\nGoing back to our last post, the IDE and tests were running in different processes, which means we need some way to communicate between them. There are a lot of different ways we can do this. For example, the first version of the framework we used exclusively for performance testing worked via files (this mode is still supported in the Starter framework). With this approach, the Starter framework prepares a simple text file with a list of commands and passes this file to the IDE. The IDE reads the file, parses the commands and arguments, and executes them one by one.\nThough functional, this approach has significant downsides. There is no real communication between the IDE and the test. All the test can do is prepare commands and wait until the IDE is finished running them. There is also no way for the IDE to communicate the results back to the test other than by storing some information in the files, which will only be read once the testing is complete.\nIt’s clear that we need a more flexible approach. We could opt for gRPC or create our own custom protocol, but fortunately there is already a standard Java technology – Java Management Extensions (or JMX for short) – that is a perfect choice for what we’re trying to achieve.\nJMX supports different connectors to manage the state of the JVM. In our case, we’re using a standard Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) protocol. This protocol allows us to access objects and invoke methods from tests in the JVM of the IDE.\nThe architecture of our RMI protocol is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a test wants to invoke a method on a remote object:\nThe test looks up the remote object in the RMI registry (the IDE in our case).\nThe IDE returns a reference to the stub, which implements the same interface as the remote object.\nWhen the client calls a method on the stub:\n\nThe stub serializes the method call, including any parameters.\nIt sends the serialized data over the network to the remote server.\nThe RMI runtime inside the IDE unmarshals the request and invokes the corresponding method on the actual remote object.\nThe method executes, and the result is serialized and sent back to the client via the stub.\nThe stub unmarshals the response and returns the result to the caller.\nThus, the stub makes remote calls feel like local method calls, without the caller worrying about low-level networking, data conversion, or request handling.\nCreating stubs\nTo demonstrate how this works in practice, let’s add the following code to our plugin:\npackage org.jetbrains.testPlugin\n\nimport com.intellij.openapi.components.Service\nimport com.jetbrains.rd.generator.nova.array\n\nclass PluginStorage {\n   companion object {\n       @JvmStatic\n       fun getPluginStorage() = Storage(\"static method\", listOf(\"static1\", \"static2\"))\n   }\n}\n@Service\nclass PluginService {\n   fun someMethod(): Unit = Unit\n   fun getAnswer(): Int = 42\n}\n@Service(Service.Level.PROJECT)\nclass PluginProjectService {\n   fun getStrings(): Array<String> = arrayOf(\"foo\",\"bar\")\n}\ndata class Storage(val key: String, val attributes: List<String>)\nThis file contains one class with the static method getPluginStorage, and two light services – one application-level PluginService and one project-level PluginProjectService. \nWe want to be able to call the methods of these classes from our test and verify their return values.\nBefore we can do this, we need to create stubs for all of the classes we wish to use. So, let’s create a Stubs.kt file in our test code:\nimport com.intellij.driver.client.Remote\n\n@Remote(\"org.jetbrains.testPlugin.PluginStorage\", plugin = \"org.example.demo\")\ninterface PluginStorage{\n   fun getPluginStorage(): Storage\n}\n\n\n@Remote(\"org.jetbrains.testPlugin.PluginService\", plugin = \"org.example.demo\")\ninterface PluginService {\n   fun getAnswer(): Int\n}\n\n\n@Remote(\"org.jetbrains.testPlugin.PluginProjectService\", plugin = \"org.example.demo\")\ninterface PluginProjectService {\n   fun getStrings(): Array<String>\n}\n\n\n@Remote(\"org.jetbrains.testPlugin.Storage\", plugin = \"org.example.demo\")\ninterface Storage{\n   fun getAttributes(): List<String>\n   fun getKey(): String\n}\nAll we’ve done is take our classes and declare corresponding interfaces with methods that we will need in our tests. We don’t need to create stubs for methods that won’t be used.\nWe also need to provide a fully qualified name of the class that will correspond to our stubs using the @Remote annotation. Here, we use strings to avoid introducing dependency between production and test code.\nThe second parameter that we need to specify is pluginId, where our classes are located. This parameter is required since IntelliJ-based IDEs use separate classloaders for each plugin, and the code that will call methods on the IDE side (Invoker) needs to know where to search for them.\nThere is built-in support for such annotations inside IntelliJ IDEA:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you rename or move the target class using refactorings, the annotation will be updated accordingly. You can also use gutters to navigate to the target class from a stub.\nCalling IDE methods from tests\nNow that we have our stubs set up, we’re ready to use them in our test:\nimport com.intellij.driver.client.*\nimport com.intellij.driver.sdk.*\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.ci.*\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.di.di\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.driver.engine.runIdeWithDriver\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.ide.IdeProductProvider\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.models.TestCase\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.plugins.PluginConfigurator\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.project.GitHubProject\nimport com.intellij.ide.starter.runner.Starter\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.*\nimport org.kodein.di.*\nimport kotlin.io.path.Path\n\nclass PluginTest {\n   @Test\n   fun testStubs() {\n       Starter.newContext(\n           testName = \"testExample\", TestCase(\n               IdeProductProvider.IC, projectInfo = GitHubProject.fromGithub(\n                   branchName = \"master\",\n                   repoRelativeUrl = \"JetBrains/ij-perf-report-aggregator\"\n               )\n           ).withVersion(\"2024.2\")\n       ).apply {\n           val pathToPlugin = System.getProperty(\"path.to.build.plugin\")\n           PluginConfigurator(this).installPluginFromPath(Path(pathToPlugin))\n       }.runIdeWithDriver().useDriverAndCloseIde {\n           val storage = utility<PluginStorage>().getPluginStorage()\n           val key = storage.getKey()\n           val attributes = storage.getAttributes()\n           Assertions.assertEquals(\"static method\", key)\n           Assertions.assertEquals(listOf(\"static1\", \"static2\"), attributes)\n\n\n           val answer = service<PluginService>().getAnswer()\n           Assertions.assertEquals(42, answer)\n\n\n           waitForProjectOpen()\n           val project = singleProject()\n           val strings = service<PluginProjectService>(project).getStrings()\n           Assertions.assertArrayEquals(arrayOf(\"foo\", \"bar\"), strings)\n       }\n   }\n}\nThere are two methods that will help us to invoke our methods: service and utility. The first one will return us an instance of service, and the second will return an instance of any class.\nYou might notice that the project-level service requires the Project stub. To get it, we use the singleProject method, which is implemented in the same way as demonstrated above:\nservice<ProjectManager>().getOpenProjects().singleOrNull()\nNote: Service and utility proxies can be acquired on each call, there is no need to cache them in clients.\nJMX/RMI limitations\nThe main inconvenience of using JMX/RMI is that you have to create stub interfaces and methods for all objects which you wish to use in your tests. But on the other hand, you don’t have to modify your production code in any way.\nAs with any protocol, JMX/RMI has its limitations:\nParameters and return values can only be:\nPrimitives and their wrappers: Integer, Short, Long, Double, Float, and Byte.\nString.\n@Remote references.\nAn array of primitive values or String or @Remote references.\nLists of primitive values or String or @Remote references.\nOnly public methods can be called.\nJMX/RMI can’t interact with suspend methods.\nWhat’s next?\nStay tuned for upcoming blog posts in this series, where we’ll cover:\nGitHub Actions: setting up continuous integration.\nCommon pitfalls: tips and tricks for stable UI tests.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "JetBrains AI Assistant is now multimodel! This is an exciting development, but what does it actually mean for you? It means AI Assistant is now more adaptable. It combines the strengths of different AI models, from the deep reasoning of large ones to the speed of compact ones, and even the privacy of local ones. \nTry AI Assistant\n                                    \nSo, which model is best for you? Do you need just one, or should you mix and match for different jobs? The answer isn’t always obvious, but don’t worry – we’ve done the homework for you. In this post, we’ll break down the models that power AI Assistant, explaining what they’re best at and how you can make the most of them.\nThe metrics we consider important \nFirst, let’s define the metrics that will help us compare the models. \nSpeed – How fast does the model generate responses? If one model is slower than another, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Some models take extra time because they use a reasoning-based approach, which can lead to more precise answers. Depending on your task, this metric can be crucial – for example if you absolutely need a quick response.\nIn this blog post we share our in-house data for speed calculated in tokens per second (TPS). \nHallucination rate – AI is powerful, but not perfect. Some models have a higher tendency to generate incorrect or misleading answers. The lower the hallucination rate, the better. In this blog post we’re relying on GitHub’s data for hallucination rate. \nContext window size – This defines how much code the model can process at once. The larger the context window, the more the AI can “remember” in a single go, which can be crucial for working on complex projects.\nCoding performance – This metric highlights how well the model can handle coding tasks. Several reliable benchmarks help us rate the LLMs: \nHumanEval+ measures how well an LLM can solve Python coding problems within a certain number of attempts. With 100 as the maximum, a high score means that the model is reliable and can generate correct code in one go.\nChatBot Arena ranks LLMs based on real user feedback, making it one of the most dynamic and practical AI benchmarks today. If you see a higher number here, the model consistently outperforms others in vote-based, head-to-head comparisons.\nAider’s polyglot benchmark evaluates how well LLMs write and fix code in multiple programming languages by checking whether their solutions run correctly. A high score indicates that the LLM is highly accurate and reliable at coding in multiple programming languages, meaning it’s a strong choice for a variety of development tasks.\nWhich LLM to use for your coding tasks\nNow that we’ve defined the metrics, let’s see how the LLMs supported by AI Assistant compare. \nLLM\n                Coding Performance\n                Speed (TPS)\n                Hallucination \nRate\n                Context Window\n            \nOpenAI\n            \nGPT-4o\nOpenAI’s most advanced and reliable GPT model, GPT-4o offers deep understanding and lightning-fast responses.\nHumanEval+: 87.2\nChatBot Arena: 1,377\nAider: 27.1%\n53.20 ±15.57\n                1.5%\n                128K tokens\n            \nGPT-4o mini\nThis is a smaller model that distills GPT-4o’s power into a compact, low-latency package.\nHumanEval+: 83.5\nChatBot Arena: 1,283\nAider: 55.6%\n62.78 ±19.72\n                1.7%\n                128K tokens\n            \no1\nThe o1 series models are trained with reinforcement learning to handle complex reasoning.

        "pubDate": "Sat, 22 Mar 2025 13:33:25 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article is brought to you by Thinus Swart, draft.dev.\nStatic application security testing (SAST) is a method for identifying vulnerabilities in application source code, binaries, or bytecode early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). By analyzing code before it’s compiled or run, SAST allows developers to catch potential security flaws before they can be exploited in production.\nWith cybersecurity threats on the rise, companies without SAST are at risk of significant financial and reputational damage if their applications or systems are breached. According to IBM’s Cost of a Data Breach Report 2024, the global average cost of a data breach is USD 4.88 million.\nIntegrating SAST into the SDLC aligns with the shift-left approach that’s being embraced by modern development teams. Shifting left involves addressing code security and code quality concerns much earlier in the development process, rather than when the project has already gone live. It embraces a proactive approach to code and application security that can also lead to better code quality and a faster time to market.\nIn this article, we’ll explore:\nWhy SAST matters\nKey considerations when choosing an SAST tool\nBest practices when implementing an SAST tool\nWhat is SAST and why does it matter?\nSAST is a code analysis method that checks an application’s source code without running it. It helps find security issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows by analyzing the code’s structure and logic during development. This allows developers to fix problems early, reducing security risks.\nUnlike reactive security measures that address vulnerabilities after an attack or late in the development cycle, SAST takes a proactive approach. By integrating automated scans into CI/CD pipelines using tools like SonarQube or Snyk, teams can continuously validate security and minimize the attack surface from the outset.\n💡 Read our Building the Snyk Plugin for TeamCity blog post for more information about how this works in TeamCity.\nThe early detection of security vulnerabilities minimizes the risk of costly incidents, data breaches, and compliance violations, while protecting against reputational damage, which can be difficult to recover from.\nSAST not only strengthens your application’s security but also helps your organization avoid fines and legal risks from noncompliance by:\nComplying with regulatory standards: SAST helps organizations meet regulatory standards by identifying security vulnerabilities that could impact customer data protection. \nFor example, it supports compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for data privacy in Europe and HIPAA for safeguarding medical health information in the US. By proactively addressing security risks in code, SAST can help you avoid hefty fines for noncompliance with these regulations.\nAligning with OWASP best practices: The OWASP Top Ten is a widely recognized standard for identifying the most critical web application security risks. Following OWASP guidelines helps developers write more secure code and mitigate common vulnerabilities that attackers frequently exploit. \nMany SAST tools are designed to detect OWASP Top Ten issues, making compliance with these best practices easier.\nMitigating the risk of financial and reputational damage: SAST’s early identification of code vulnerabilities can help mitigate the risk of cybersecurity breaches, which are costly both in monetary terms and in potential damage to brand reputation and customer trust. The average cost of a data breach has risen to millions of dollars, with the added risk of losing customer loyalty and investor confidence.\n\n💡See also: What Is DAST? A Guide to Dynamic Application Statis Security\n\nKey considerations when choosing an SAST tool\n\n\nSelecting the right SAST tool is crucial to your SDLC. Not all tools are created equal, and choosing one that aligns with your team’s needs can significantly increase adoption and usage.\n\n\nKey factors like language support, detection accuracy, and seamless integration into your CI/CD pipelines should guide your decision-making.\n\n\nLanguage coverage\n\n\nOne of the more important things to consider is the language and framework support a potential SAST tool can offer. A few basic steps can significantly help when deciding on an SAST tool:\n\n\n\nInventory your codebases: Begin by cataloging the programming languages, frameworks, and libraries currently in use across your projects. Consider legacy applications and codebases as well, since these applications might not have had a code security review in the past and could benefit from the use of an SAST tool.\n\n\nAnticipate future needs: Consider upcoming projects or new clients that might require the adoption of different languages or frameworks. \nAn SAST tool with broad language coverage would be advantageous if your projects span different languages. Conversely, if your organization specializes in a specific language, it might be best to look for an SAST tool that specializes in it as well.\n\n\nEvaluate framework-specific support: Many modern applications rely heavily on frameworks like Django for Python or React for JavaScript. While these frameworks usually do a good job of minimizing developer error, introducing misconfiguration issues can be easy. An SAST tool that covers a specific framework would be able to pick up these misconfigurations and insecure patterns.\n\n\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure your chosen SAST tool provides comprehensive language and framework coverage and reduces the risk of missed vulnerabilities in critical parts of the application.\n\n\nLow false positive rate/high true positive rate\n\n\nDetection accuracy is a very important factor when selecting an SAST tool for your organization. Tools with high false positive rates can overwhelm developers and increase the time to release, as they end up chasing nonexistent or trivial issues. \n\n\nThis high false positive rate can also lead to alert fatigue, which in turn can lead to noncompliance. Conversely, a tool with a high true positive rate provides actionable results, helping developers focus on real security risks.\n\n\nWhile you can use sample reports and benchmarks to measure the accuracy of these tools, doing so doesn’t replace the experience of conducting a trial run of an SAST tool you’re considering on your existing code. \n\n\nPay attention to how well the tool distinguishes between actual vulnerabilities and benign code patterns. Tools that provide good remedies for each finding can further improve code quality by reducing the guesswork for developers.\n\n\nHow to choose a SAST tool\n\n\nIt’s also strongly recommended to look for tools that allow you to customize and fine-tune detection rule sets to better fit your projects. For example, you might want to suppress specific warning messages due to customer limitations that you have to work around. \n\n\nThe flexibility to fine-tune your scanning parameters can help further improve the signal-to-noise ratio, making it easier for developers to focus on real security issues and integrate security checks into their workflow.\n\n\nEase of integration into CI/CD pipelines\n\n\nTo make the most effective use of an SAST tool, you need to scan early and scan often. Automating your security checks is key to enabling your developers to fix issues as early as possible in the development lifecycle.\n\n\n\nSAST SDLC\n\n\n\nAny SAST tool that can integrate with a CI/CD platform like JetBrains TeamCity will allow you to automate your security checks at important phases in the development cycle – for example, every time a new branch needs to be merged into the main branch or a pull request is submitted for a software patch.\n\n\nThis can supply developers with feedback directly within the workflow they’re used to, and they can respond to vulnerabilities immediately.\n\n\nBest practices when implementing an SAST tool\n\n\nWhile integrating an SAST tool into your development process is an important step, ensuring it’s configured properly and used effectively further enhances your developers’ experience. This can foster a culture of being vigilant and employing secure coding practices as early as possible.\n\n\nFor this to happen, keep these best practices in mind when advocating for and deploying an SAST tool in your environment.\n\n\n\nBest practices for implementing SAST tools\n\n\n\nScan your codebase regularly\n\n\nRegular scanning is key to identifying vulnerabilities as they occur. Automating your scanning at different stages of the development lifecycle allows you to catch and remediate issues before the code gets put into production.\n\n\nWhile incremental scans of commits and pull requests are a great idea, you should also schedule full scans of the entire code repository at regular intervals. Full scans can reveal vulnerabilities in legacy code or parts of the application that are rarely accessed and that wouldn’t show up in a pull request or code commit.\n\n\nAutomate as much of the process as possible\n\n\nA lot of what has been discussed so far, like full codebase scans and CI/CD integration, only makes sense once you make the move to automating as much of the process as possible. As previously discussed, automation is key to driving the adoption of an SAST tool, as it provides your developers with immediate feedback that they can act upon.\n\n\nIn addition to automating scans, you can automate monthly reports or implement dashboards or notification systems to help your team monitor and track their code quality trends over time.\n\n\nPrioritize critical vulnerabilities\n\n\nNot all vulnerabilities carry the same level of risk, and teams must focus their efforts on the critical ones first. SAST tools generally supply a severity rating for vulnerabilities that have been identified. This severity rating should align with your organization’s risk management strategies and help you decide which vulnerabilities to prioritize. Issues that could lead to data breaches or significant system compromise should be addressed immediately, while less pressing ones can be addressed during regular patching schedules.\n\n\nEducate developers about secure programming practices\n\n\nEven the best SAST tool is only as effective as the team using it. Developers must understand how to interpret scan results and recognize how adopting secure coding practices can help speed up the development process for the entire team. If the SAST tool you’re adopting offers training, you should invest in that training for your developers to familiarize them with the tool’s interface, features, and reporting capabilities.\n\n\nWork on fostering a security-first mindset in your development team and the team culture in general. Encourage collaboration between your security and your development teams, and emphasize that security is a shared responsibility across the entire organization.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nStatic application security testing is an essential component of a secure software development lifecycle. In this article, we explored what SAST is, why it matters, and the key considerations for selecting the right SAST tool for your organization. \n\n\nWe also identified some best practices to optimize SAST implementation and ensure that security scans are both effective and automated. If you implement SAST correctly, your teams will be able to identify vulnerabilities earlier in the development lifecycle, reduce risks in general, and ensure compliance with industry standards.To streamline your SAST implementation efforts, consider integrating it with a CI/CD platform like JetBrains TeamCity, which offers support for many SAST tools and SAST providers via its plugin marketplace.",

It’s packed with new features, including massive UI updates, a new Run in Docker build feature, and JetBrains-crafted recipes available in our Marketplace.\nUI updates\nIn line with our commitment to make TeamCity easier and more intuitive to use, this release introduces significant UI improvements:\nSimplified navigation: The Edit Project/Configuration button is now a Settings toggle, with distinct accent colors for View and Edit modes. Once you switch to Edit mode, you can navigate across multiple projects without exiting it.\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganized settings: Project settings are now grouped into categories for easier navigation, while build configuration settings are arranged as tabs.\n\n\n\n\n\nRefined layout: The headers of project, configuration, and build pages are now more compact, and build pages highlight key details like the repository branch, build time, and queue time. The Actions menu is now conveniently accessible via an ellipsis button next to Run.\n\n\n\n\nIntroducing recipes (goodbye meta-runners!)\nThis release marks the beginning of meta-runners’ evolution into recipes. While the core idea remains, recipes offer new advantages. For example, you can:\nDefine them in XML or, in future TeamCity versions, YAML\nUse ones hand-crafted by JetBrains from Marketplace\n\n\n\n\nIn upcoming releases, we plan to add support for sharing your own recipes on Marketplace. Share your feedback and public recipe design ideas in the comments under this YouTrack ticket: TW-91941.\nEnhanced parameter control\nThe Parameters tab now separates input and output parameters:\nInput parameters are your standard pre-2025.03 parameters designed to be used directly by their parent configurations.\nOutput parameters are parameters with explicit access permissions, shareable with dependent configurations via the dep.<config_name>.<parameter_name> syntax.\n\n\n\n\nThis clear separation serves two purposes: enhancing security by keeping parameters that were never meant to be shared private, and allowing configuration developers to focus on adjusting their input parameters without worrying about breaking other configurations that import them.\nPerforce manual and automatic merge support\nTeamCity now supports manual and automatic code merges between Perforce streams:\nThe automatic merge feature supports configurations that use Perforce VCS roots.\nThe Actions build menu includes an option to merge changes to a target Perforce stream manually.\nImproved Docker and Podman integration\nVersion 2025.03 also includes a few updates that widen your options for running builds inside containers.\nYou can run all configuration steps in a single container using the new Run in Docker build feature.\nKotlin script build steps now support the Container Wrapper, which allows them to run in Docker and Podman containers.\nThe Docker Support feature is now called Docker Registry Connections, better reflecting its role in managing private container registry logins and image cleanup.\nThe complete list of implemented features and fixed issues is available in our documentation: \nWhat’s New \nRelease Notes\nIf you have any questions, feel free to get in touch with us in the comments below or via the support form. We do our best to answer them all!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This year, the TeamCity team is working on a number of new initiatives, including updating the UI, TeamCity recipes, Jenkins migration tools, and many others. Read on to learn what our focus is for 2025.\nModernizing the TeamCity Enterprise interface\nIn 2025, we’re taking a major step forward in enhancing the TeamCity experience. The modern TeamCity Pipelines interface is making its way to TeamCity Enterprise, bringing a fresh, intuitive UI to enterprise users.\n\n\n\n\nThis move aligns with our broader vision of making Pipelines accessible to all TeamCity Enterprise customers. Why? Because we believe it delivers value on multiple levels:\nSimplifies project setup. Getting started should be effortless, whether you’re a new user or an experienced DevOps engineer.\nEnhances the build chain editing experience. We’re improving how you configure and visualize your CI/CD pipelines.\nProvides YAML support. YAML is a popular way of configuring pipelines as code, and we want to provide this option to those customers who need it.\nIntroduces full branching support. Work seamlessly with feature branches, pull requests, and complex Git workflows to improve collaboration and automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nStay tuned for more improvements as we continue updating the product UI!\nVCS integrations: UX improvements\nThis year, we’re focusing on redesigning the user experience to make it easier to configure connections, manage VCS roots, and streamline repository setup. \nWe’re also enhancing TeamCity’s integration with Perforce, GitHub, and other VCS roots.\nTeamCity recipes\nRecipes are reusable YAML-based actions that simplify build configuration by handling tasks like setting up tools, running tests, or validating source files.\n\n\n\n\nHow it works\nWhen adding a build step, you can search for actions that fit your needs (e.g. “lint”).\nTeamCity suggests matching actions, and you can then select and apply the desired action. \nThis feature will make the build configuration process faster, more flexible, and easier to share, as we’re planning to make recipes shareable.\nDependency cache\nTeamCity’s dependency cache enhances the existing build caching mechanism by automatically managing commonly used build system directories. Currently, you must manually specify which directories to cache between build agents within the artifact storage. \nWith this improvement, TeamCity will automatically detect and cache well-known directories for supported build systems, reducing manual setup and ensuring a seamless experience. This is particularly beneficial for teams using ephemeral cloud agents and TeamCity Pipelines, where maintaining persistent build data is crucial. \nFor now, the feature will support Maven, Gradle, and NuGet build runners.\nThere are two main benefits that the feature brings:\nSignificantly improved out-of-the-box usability, aligning with our goal of delivering a top-tier CI/CD experience with minimal configuration.\n\n\n\n\nMinimized end-user spending. By caching dependencies, you can significantly reduce build duration, thus reducing costs.\nImproving build feature usability\nMany important build features in TeamCity are hard to discover and configure due to their placement in the Build Features list. To improve discoverability and usability, we’re integrating build features directly into the execution page, making them easier to access and configure. \nThis update streamlines workflows while maintaining compatibility with plugins and the Kotlin DSL, ensuring a more intuitive and efficient setup.\n[Experimental] Jenkins migration tool\nJenkins remains one of the most popular CI/CD solutions. According to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report, 46% of respondents reported using it regularly in their organization.\nWhile it’s a great open-source product, it comes with its limitations, including a cumbersome UI, complex setup, and numerous plugins to handle – all this can be a hassle to manage. \nWe’re building a migration tool to make it easier for teams to switch from Jenkins to TeamCity. If you’re looking for a powerful CI/CD solution that supports complex workflows, this tool will help you migrate your pipelines without the hassle of moving everything manually.\nMeanwhile, if you’d like to explore how you can migrate your CI/CD projects from Jenkins to TeamCity, we can help! Please reach out to us via this form.\nDynamic pipelines: flexible build chains in TeamCity\nCurrently, build chains in TeamCity are static, requiring manual updates to build configurations and dependencies when changes are needed. While this works well for stable pipelines, it becomes cumbersome in scenarios requiring flexibility.\nFor example, if test suites are distributed across multiple build configurations, adding a new suite means modifying the build chain for all branches and ensuring the new configuration is disabled where it’s not needed. This manual process makes it difficult to efficiently manage dynamic workflows.\nTo address this, we are exploring the ability to dynamically generate pipelines at runtime, allowing build configurations to be defined programmatically based on branch-specific logic, test distribution strategies, or other dynamic factors. This would eliminate the need for rigid, pre-defined build chains and offer more adaptability for complex CI/CD workflows.\nSimilar to Jenkins’ Pipeline plugin, this approach could introduce a DSL-based scripting mechanism that allows teams to define pipelines in version control, ensuring greater flexibility and automation in pipeline execution.\nFollow our progress on YouTrack.\nEnhancing the Kotlin DSL with the K2 compiler\nKotlin is introducing the K2 compiler, a next-generation compiler that brings improved performance and new language features. One key benefit for TeamCity is the reduced compilation time for versioned settings, minimizing the delay between configuration changes and their application.\nTo leverage these improvements, we plan to adopt the K2 compiler for processing the Kotlin DSL. However, since K2 introduces some breaking changes, we will carefully evaluate its impact on existing configurations to ensure a smooth transition for users.\nReading configurations from Git for multi-node setups\nIn multi-node TeamCity installations, configuration files are currently stored on a shared disk, which introduces several challenges. Nodes simultaneously reading and modifying configuration files can cause consistency issues, and setting up a shared disk with acceptable performance is often complex.\nTo address these challenges, we plan to store and synchronize configuration files in Git, leveraging the existing repository used by TeamCity for tracking configuration changes. This approach will ensure reliable, conflict-free configuration management across multiple nodes while eliminating the need for a dedicated shared disk.\nAlibaba Cloud support\nWe are exploring Alibaba Cloud integration to expand TeamCity’s support for diverse cloud environments. This will enable users to seamlessly connect TeamCity with Alibaba Cloud services, improving scalability, resource management, and automation for CI/CD workflows. \nWe hope that the integration will be especially valuable for teams leveraging Alibaba Cloud’s infrastructure for build agents, storage, and deployments, ensuring a smoother experience for users in the Asia-Pacific market and beyond. If you’re using Alibaba Cloud, we’d love to talk with you!\nAgent autoscaling\nTo enhance efficiency and flexibility in TeamCity, we are introducing agent autoscaling, allowing users to better manage cloud-based build agents. This feature addresses two key user needs:\nMinimum available agents. Ensures a baseline number of agents are always ready, reducing wait times, especially when agents have long startup durations.\nScheduled scaling. Allows users to adjust the maximum number of agents dynamically based on a predefined schedule, optimizing resource allocation during peak and off-peak hours.\nBy automating agent availability, this feature improves CI/CD performance, reduces manual scaling efforts, and helps teams control costs while ensuring builds run smoothly.\nTeamCity Pipelines\nAt the moment, TeamCity Pipelines is a lightweight, easy-to-use, yet powerful CI/CD product for smaller teams. It cuts your runtime by up to 40%, helping you build and deliver faster, thanks to smart features like the visual pipeline editor and optimization center.\nHere’s what we’re working on this year for TeamCity Pipelines.\nJob debugging: pause and investigate failures in real time\nDebugging failed builds often means reacting after the fact – opening the terminal and investigating what went wrong. But what if you could pause a job right at the moment an issue occurs?\nWith our new job debugging feature, you’ll be able to set breakpoints before or after specific build steps, making it easier to pinpoint problems as they happen.\n\n\n\n\nThis brings a more interactive debugging experience inspired by familiar concepts from IntelliJ IDEA, such as breakpoint toggling and a dedicated Debug button.\nIn the future, we plan to refine this further by allowing breakpoints within individual CLI script commands.\nMore VCS integration options\nYou can now build your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Git projects in TeamCity Pipelines. This year, we’ll be expanding VCS integration functionality to include the Commit Status Publisher and other powerful features. Stay tuned!\nPersonal notifications\nYou can now subscribe to receive notifications when a pipeline fails. Sometimes, however, you might want to receive more (or less) information about build statuses, etc. You’ll be able to choose the events that you want to be notified about, for example, when a pipeline fails to start, when the first build error occurs, and others.\nIntegration with IntelliJ IDEA\nWe’re working on a seamless integration between IntelliJ IDEA and TeamCity Pipelines. The integration will make it easier to manage CI/CD workflows directly from the IDE. Developers will be able to trigger builds and monitor results without leaving their coding environment. \nThis seamless connection helps streamline development, reducing context switching and making CI/CD an integral part of the development process.\nRestricting incoming dependencies for enhanced security\nTo improve security and control, we are working on a feature that will allow project administrators to restrict and view incoming snapshots and artifact dependencies for build configurations.\nThe new restriction mechanism will empower administrators to define and control which projects and configurations can establish dependencies, reducing security risks and ensuring better oversight of build relationships.\nThat’s it for now!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Debugging computational notebooks can be quite frustrating for a variety of reasons, including issues like out-of-order cell execution, missing data files, and library conflicts. Traditional AI tools often struggle with these problems due to the interactive nature of notebooks, but at JetBrains, we are exploring new solutions.\nOur research team has developed a prototype of an AI agent that autonomously fixes notebook errors by modifying and executing cells until the problems are solved. \nIn this post, we’ll explore how the prototype works, how it improves the debugging process, and how it compares to simpler LLM-based solutions in terms of cost and user experience.\nWhy automate notebook debugging\nComputational notebooks are widely used for data analysis, research, and hypothesis testing because they allow users to integrate different data types and execute cells non-linearly. This creates vast opportunities for experimentation and use in data science.\nHowever, this flexibility and interactivity come at the cost of reproducibility and having to deal with frequent bugs. Studies show that up to 75% of Jupyter notebooks cannot be re-run without issues. At the same time, debugging them is particularly difficult, as it requires the interactive, iterative inspection of errors and their context rather than simple static analysis.\nUsing LLMs like GPT-4 is standard practice for other debugging tasks. However, for notebook debugging, it is rather challenging due to context size limitations. Notebooks require runtime information to reflect their state, which means they often need a large context window for error resolution. AI agents address this by interacting with notebooks iteratively – much like humans do, but significantly faster.\nThe JetBrains Research team has created a prototype of just such an AI agent for Datalore. It is capable of creating, editing, and executing cells to resolve runtime exceptions.\nHere’s a short demo showcasing the debugging AI agent in action:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to see a detailed report on this project, check out this preprint. These results were also presented at EMNLP, a leading conference for natural language processing and artificial intelligence.\nHow does the debugging AI agent work?\n\nLet’s start with a broad overview of our AI agent system. It consists of three main components – the LLM module, the environment, and the user interface – which work together as follows:\nStart: Whenever the execution of a cell results in an exception, the debugging AI agent can be called with a Fix with AI Agent button that appears below the error message. When clicked, it starts the agentic debugging cycle, which is shown as an interaction with an LLM in a separate window. \n\n\n\n\n\nCycle: At each iteration of the debugging cycle, the LLM module collects the required information and adds it to the debugging prompt passed to the LLM, in this case, GPT-4. The LLM then generates an answer, which includes some reasoning as well as the next action, such as editing and executing cells or finishing the debugging process once the error has been resolved. The action suggested by the model is then executed in the environment, and the results are added to the prompt for the next round of debugging. \n\n\n\n\n\nFinish: This iterative loop continues until the error is resolved or until the limit on time or the number of iterations is reached. In our experiments, most of the debugging runs ended in the error being successfully resolved after only a few steps, so the limits were rarely required in practice.\nHow does the AI agent prompt the LLM?\nLet’s take a closer look at the core of our AI agent system, namely, the LLM module. Our AI agent prompts the LLM using a “system prompt” that covers the general approach to the task and a “user prompt” containing specific details about the current stage of the debugging run. Below, you can see shortened versions of the two prompts.\n\nSystem prompt\nGeneral purposeYou are a coding assistant that should help solve the user’s error in a computational notebook. You should use functions to help handle real-time user queries and return outputs only in the form of valid JSON.\nAvailable toolsYou have a few ways of interacting with the environment:\nchange the code of the existing cells, run it, and give the output.add a new cell with your own code, run it, and give the output.run any cell as is and give the output.If you’re sure the error won’t show up in the cell where it was found, you can run finish.\nWorkflow guidelinesKeep trying for at least 10 steps before you stop, but if you think you’ve solved the problem, you can run finish right away.If you can fix the error without changing any code, do that. Don’t edit the existing code or add new code unless you really need to.Use only the functions given to you. If you have many functions to choose from, pick the one that solves the problem quickest.When you think you’ve fixed the problem, run finish to say you’re done.\nHacksJust adding try – except is not a solution. Commenting out the code that produced the error is not a solution. You should propose only meaningful solutions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial user promptHere’s a Jupyter notebook. It uses {separator} as a separator between cells. Note that cell indexes START FROM 1! {notebook} An error occurred in the cell with num {cell_num}. The error trace is the following: {error} Please resolve the error. You must use only the tools defined above to resolve the error. Return output only as valid JSON. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe system prompt opens with a general description of the problem, provides some guidelines on how it should be solved, and then closes with instructions about actions. We use reflection as the algorithm for choosing the next action, asking the LLM to reflect on the outcomes of the previous actions taken before selecting the next tool to call. The reflections are output as comments for each selected action and are available at all following steps. The guidelines also encourage the LLM to explore the environment and discourage large outputs and “hacks”, such as deleting the error cell or commenting out the problematic code. \nThe user prompt initially consists of the notebook code and the error cell number, again accompanied by a short task description. After each step, the actions suggested by the LLM are converted into commands and executed, and the result is collected as an input for the next user prompt, along with the conversation history.\nYou can observe the entire debugging process in real time via the interface where the conversation and the actions are visualized.\nHow costly is the AI agent?\nA significant cost with any AI system comes from running large language models, with costs primarily driven by the number of request and response tokens processed.\nTo compare costs, we evaluated the AI agent against a simpler zero-shot debugging approach in Datalore, using 100 hours of hackathon coding records. The dataset featured an extensive notebook action history, so the errors that occurred could be reproduced and addressed by either of the AI solutions. On average, resolving an error with the AI agent was 2.5 times as expensive, costing $0.22 per error with GPT-4 versus $0.09 with the simpler method.\nThe AI agent’s higher cost came mainly from using three times as many request tokens for its memory stack, while the number of response tokens was similar between methods. Nevertheless, the cost remained practical for industry use since input tokens are cheaper and most errors were fixed on the first step.\nUser feedback about the AI agent\nWe used the same zero-shot baseline to compare the user experiences with these two AI algorithms. In particular, we wanted to know how well users thought the AI agent resolved problems and how much they believed it could improve their productivity. We had two groups of programmers complete the same data-filtering task. One group used the zero-shot baseline, and the other used our agentic solution.\n\n\n\n\nWe found that the users were quite satisfied with both solutions, rating them either good or excellent, and they slightly favored the AI agent. The users also seemed to rely more on the AI agent. However, the participants also reported that the agentic solution was less easy to use. We suspect this may be due to the lack of user control over its actions as well as the speed at which it acts. \nIn the feedback, the users suggested that slowing down the conversation and highlighting the introduced changes in the notebook would provide more insight into the AI agent’s thought process and solution. They also proposed making the agentic solution process more interactive so they have a way of interrupting or changing the actions suggested by the AI agent. Finally, they asked for a way to access the agent before any error has occurred.\nBenefits of AI debugging: Looking forward\nFinally, we compared the AI agent to the unaided human debugging process that comprised our dataset. In this comparison, the agentic solution offers obvious benefits:\nFaster debugging: The AI agent typically fixed issues in under a minute, while humans took an average of 3.5 minutes and up to 20 minutes for more complex cases.\nEffectiveness for common small errors: The agent quickly resolved small bugs, like incorrect pandas functions or arguments.\nInsights into root causes: The agent highlighted and explained changes, which helped to identify root causes of and solutions for errors.\nThe main takeaways of the study for the agentic debugging research concern the areas of improvement:\nReduced cost: One solution to the higher cost of the agentic approach could be history caching, which can reduce the number of request tokens used. \nIncreased user control: The study of user experience highlighted that users would prefer to have more control over the process, such as the option to call the agent before any error occurs. \nBuilding on top of this work, we will continue making Datalore smarter with AI-based features.",

We previously enabled viewing your pull request comments inline in your working files. Now, the latest update empowers you to add comments directly within the IDE, streamlining the review process. Now, pull request reviewers can conduct deep reviews with the navigational power of the IDE and stay in their focused environment.\n\nWe heard from your feedback that the web experience for reviewing pull requests can only go so far. When you need to really understand your colleagues’ proposed changes, it’s best to checkout their branch and use the navigation and build tools in VS. Once you’re on their branch and you’ve identified some feedback, you can add the comment directly without having to map it back to the code in the web. This extends previous functionality where you could view and reply to only existing comments.\nEnabling this feature\nTo start using the new commenting feature, first ensure you have enabled the feature flags:\nTools > Options > Preview Features > Pull Request Comments \nTools > Options > Pull Request Add Comment.\nOnce these are activated, checkout any branch with an active pull request and click on Show comments in files in the InfoBar to activate the pull request comments experience in the editor. Alternatively, you can enable comments by using the top level menu Git > ADO/GitHub > Show Comments in Files or from the PR dropdown menu next to the view all commits link in the Git Changes window.\n\nAdding comments to pull request files\nSimply click on the Add Comment icon in the margin, or right-click the line you’d like to comment on and select Git > Add Comment from the context menu.\n\nThe comment icon will only appear in files that are part of the pull request. For GitHub pull requests, comments can only be added to lines surrounding and including the changes.\nWe appreciate your feedback!\nThis is another step in our journey to deliver a powerful and integrated pull request experience. We started with supporting the create a pull request workflow, enabled viewing pull request comments on your checked out branches, and now, you can add new review comments, as well!\nWe won’t stop there. Your continuous suggestions and insights play a crucial role in shaping the tools we build. We’re thrilled to bring you this enhancement and are eager to hear how it improves your workflow.\nThe post Enhance Pull Request Reviews with In-Depth Feedback appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

Do you often struggle to find detailed instructions on using certain features effectively?\nNow, there’s a solution to get you the information you need right in the IDE.\n\nVisual Studio now makes it easy to access GitHub Copilot Chat from Feature Search (Ctrl+Q). Clicking “Ask Copilot” will send your query to GitHub Copilot Chat and get detailed responses, without leaving Visual Studio and search for docs online.\nThis tool interprets the semantic meaning of your query, considers your Visual Studio version, and provides accurate answers. This means no more guessing the correct terminology or navigating through multiple menus.\nFor instance, typing ‘prettify file’ in the traditional search might not bring up the ‘format document’ option. However, GitHub Copilot Chat understands the intent behind your query and can guide you to the correct setting with all the information you need to use it.\nHow it works\nNotice the @vs label in the sent chat message? When your search query gets sent over to the GitHub Copilot chat, the @vs agent is called. This @vs agent has in-depth knowledge about the workings of Visual Studio, with strong context on the features available in the current version you’re using and how those work.\nThe @vs agent works in the Visual Studio GitHub Copilot Chat even if you’re not starting from Feature Search. You can invoke the agent on your own by adding @vs to your chat message.\nAppreciation for your feedback\nYour insights help us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support.\nYour feedback is invaluable in shaping Visual Studio’s future. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Find the IDE features you need with GitHub Copilot and Search appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

실행 스레드: ${Thread.currentThread().name}\")\n    return \"Result from $dispatchersName\"\n}\n\n\nasync()를 호출할 때 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않으면, 해당 코루틴은 상위 코루틴의 컨텍스트(여기서는 runBlocking의 컨텍스트)를 그대로 상속받게 됩니다. 이 예제에서는 doSomething() 함수가 두 번 호출되며, 각각 2,000ms의 지연(delay)을 포함한 블록킹 작업을 수행한다고 가정합니다. 이 경우, 두 작업은 async를 통해 병렬로 실행되므로 이론상 전체 소요 시간은 2,000ms 내외여야 합니다.\n실제 실행 로그는 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nMain 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n[deferred1] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\n[deferred2] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\n[deferred2] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\n[deferred1] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\ndeferred1 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\ndeferred2 결과: Result from deferred2 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n소요 시간 : 2020 ms\nMain 종료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n\n\n로그를 분석해보면, Main 코루틴은 “Test worker @coroutine#1” 스레드에서 시작되고, async로 생성된 두 자식 코루틴은 각각 “Test worker @coroutine#2”와 “Test worker @coroutine#3” 스레드에서 실행됩니다. 두 코루틴은 독립적으로 동시에 실행되기 때문에, doSomething() 함수 내에서 2,000ms의 대기가 발생하더라도 두 작업이 병렬로 처리되어 전체 소요 시간은 약 2,000ms(실제 2020ms)로 측정됩니다.\n즉, async()를 통해 생성된 두 코루틴이 부모의 컨텍스트를 상속받더라도, 각각의 코루틴이 별도의 스레드에서 실행되어 병렬 처리가 이루어지는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이는 동일한 스레드에서 순차적으로 처리될 경우(예: 동기 호출 시 4,000ms 소요)와 비교했을 때, 전체 실행 시간을 크게 단축시키는 효과가 있음을 보여줍니다.\n기본 async() 사용 시 동작 (Thread.sleep 사용)#\n아래 코드는 doSomething() 함수 내부에서 delay(2000) 대신 Thread.sleep(2000)을 사용한 경우입니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nprivate fun doSomething(dispatchersName: String): String {\n    println(\"[$dispatchersName] 시작 - 실행 스레드: ${Thread.currentThread().name}\")\n    // 2,000 ms 대기 (Thread.sleep 사용)\n    Thread.sleep(2000)\n    println(\"[$dispatchersName] 완료 - 실행 스레드: ${Thread.currentThread().name}\")\n    return \"Result from $dispatchersName\"\n}\n\n\n이 경우 실행 로그는 다음과 같이 나타납니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nMain 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n[deferred1] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\n[deferred1] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\n[deferred2] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\n[deferred2] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\ndeferred1 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\ndeferred2 결과: Result from deferred2 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n소요 시간 : 4021 ms\nMain 종료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n\n\n기본 async() 사용 시 동작(Thread.sleep 사용)에서는, 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않아 상위 코루틴의 컨텍스트를 그대로 상속받게 됩니다. 이 경우, runBlocking 내부의 메인 스레드인 Test worker가 블로킹되기 때문에, doSomething() 함수 내의 Thread.sleep(2000)이 호출되면 해당 스레드가 2,000ms 동안 점유되고, 첫 번째 코루틴(deferred1)이 완료되어야만 두 번째 코루틴(deferred2)이 실행될 수 있습니다. 그 결과, 두 작업이 실제로 순차적으로 실행되어 전체 소요 시간이 약 4021ms로 측정되는 것입니다.\nDispatchers.IO를 적용한 경우#\n이 문제를 해결하기 위해 async() 호출 시 Dispatchers.IO를 지정하면, 각 코루틴이 I/O 전용 스레드 풀에서 실행되므로 별도의 스레드에서 동시에 작업이 수행됩니다. 수정된 코드는 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n\nval deferred1 = async(Dispatchers.IO) { doSomething(\"deferred1\") }\nval deferred2 = async(Dispatchers.IO) { doSomething(\"deferred2\") }\n\n\n이때 실행 로그는 아래와 같이 나타납니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nMain 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n[deferred2] 시작 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-3 @coroutine#3\n[deferred1] 시작 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-1 @coroutine#2\n[deferred2] 완료 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-3 @coroutine#3\n[deferred1] 완료 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-1 @coroutine#2\ndeferred1 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\ndeferred2 결과: Result from deferred2 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n소요 시간 : 2018 ms\nMain 종료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n\n\n여기서 확인할 수 있듯이, Main 코루틴은 Test worker에서 시작하지만, deferred1과 deferred2 코루틴은 각각 DefaultDispatcher-worker-1과 DefaultDispatcher-worker-3과 같이 별도의 스레드에서 실행됩니다. 각 코루틴이 독립된 스레드에서 실행되기 때문에, doSomething() 함수 내부의 Thread.sleep(2000)과 같은 블록킹 호출이 해당 코루틴의 스레드에만 영향을 미치며, 다른 코루틴의 실행에는 영향을 주지 않습니다. 그 결과, 두 작업이 동시에 병렬로 실행되어 전체 소요 시간이 약 2018ms로 단축되는 효과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\nprivate fun doSomething(dispatchersName: String): String {\n    // ...\n    // runBlocking { delay(2000) } // delay 에서 Thread sleep 으로 대체\n    Thread.sleep(2000)\n    // ...\n    return \"Result from $dispatchersName\"\n}\n\n\n기존 delay에서 Thread.sleep(2000) 으로 변경 했을 경우에 로그를 보자\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nMain 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n[deferred1] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\n[deferred1] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#2\n[deferred2] 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\n[deferred2] 완료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#3\ndeferred1 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\ndeferred2 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n소요 시간 : 4021 ms\nMain 종료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n\n\ndoSomething() 함수가 @coroutine#2와 @coroutine#3에서 각각 실행되었음에도 불구하고, 전체 소요 시간이 4021ms로 측정된다는 것은 async()를 사용할 때 의도한 병렬 실행이 이루어지지 않았음을 의미합니다. 그 이유는, async()에 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않아 상위 코루틴(runBlocking)의 컨텍스트를 그대로 상속받게 되면서, Main 스레드인 Test worker가 deferred1의 실행으로 인해 블록킹되고, deferred2도 동일한 Test worker에서 실행되기 때문입니다. 즉, Test worker 스레드가 블록킹이 해제될 때까지 전체 작업이 순차적으로 실행됩니다.\n이 문제를 해결하기 위해, 각 async() 호출 시 Dispatchers.IO와 같이 별도의 I/O 전용 스레드 풀을 지정하면, 각 코루틴이 상위 컨텍스트를 상속받지 않고 독립적인 스레드에서 실행되게 됩니다. 다음과 같이 코드를 수정하면, deferred1과 deferred2가 각각 다른 스레드에서 동시에 블록킹 작업을 수행하므로, 전체 소요 시간이 약 2000ms 내외로 단축됩니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n\nval deferred1 = async(Dispatchers.IO) { doSomething(\"deferred1\") }\nval deferred2 = async(Dispatchers.IO) { doSomething(\"deferred2\") }\n\n\n이렇게 수정한 후 로그를 확인하면, Main 코루틴은 여전히 Test worker에서 실행되지만, deferred1은 DefaultDispatcher-worker-1, deferred2는 DefaultDispatcher-worker-3과 같이 서로 다른 스레드에서 실행되어 병렬 처리가 이루어지는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\nMain 시작 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n[deferred2] 시작 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-3 @coroutine#3\n[deferred1] 시작 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-1 @coroutine#2\n[deferred2] 완료 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-3 @coroutine#3\n[deferred1] 완료 - 실행 스레드: DefaultDispatcher-worker-1 @coroutine#2\ndeferred1 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\ndeferred2 결과: Result from deferred1 - 호출 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n소요 시간 : 2018 ms\nMain 종료 - 실행 스레드: Test worker @coroutine#1\n\n\nTest worker 으로 메인 스레드가 시작하는 것을 확인할 수 있고 deferred1, deferred2의 수행 스레드가 DefaultDispatcher-worker-1, DefaultDispatcher-worker-3 으로 각기 다른 스레드를 통해서 수행되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n각기 다른 스레드로 동작하기 때문에 각각의 스레드가 블록킹 당해도 동시에 수행이 가능하며 소요 시간이 2018 ms 으로 동작하는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이 처럼 스레드가 블록킹 당하는 경우라면 Dispatchers.IO 가 적절한 대안이 될 수 있습니다.\n실제 사례: JDBC 드라이버와 블록킹 문제#\n다음은 JDBC 드라이버를 사용하는 페이징 쿼리 예제입니다. 아래 코드에서는 content와 totalCount 두 쿼리를 동시에 실행하도록 작성되었지만, async()에 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않아 모든 코루틴이 runBlocking의 컨텍스트를 상속받아 동일한 스레드에서 순차적으로 실행됩니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n\noverride fun findPagingBy(pageable: Pageable, address: String): Page<Order> = runBlocking {\n  log.info(\"findPagingBy thread : ${Thread.currentThread()}\")\n  val content: Deferred<List<Order>> = async() {\n    log.info(\"content thread : ${Thread.currentThread()}\")\n    from(order)\n      .select(order)\n      .innerJoin(user).on(order.userId.eq(user.id))\n      .leftJoin(coupon).on(order.couponId.eq(coupon.id))\n      .where(order.address.eq(address))\n      .run {\n        querydsl.applyPagination(pageable, this).fetch()\n      }\n  }\n  val totalCount: Deferred<Long> = async() {\n    log.info(\"count thread : ${Thread.currentThread()}\")\n    from(order)\n      .select(order.count())\n      .where(order.address.eq(address))\n      .fetchFirst()\n  }\n  PageImpl(content.await(), pageable, totalCount.await())\n}\n\n\n아래 이미지는 위 코드가 실행되었을 때의 로그를 보여줍니다.\n\n여기서 특히 강조해야 할 점은, JDBC 드라이버가 기본적으로 블록킹 I/O를 수행한다는 것입니다. JDBC 드라이버는 데이터베이스와의 통신 과정에서 네트워크 I/O 및 쿼리 실행을 진행하는 동안 스레드를 블록킹합니다. 이로 인해 동일한 스레드에서 쿼리가 순차적으로 실행될 경우, 한 쿼리의 블록킹이 다른 쿼리의 실행까지 지연시키게 됩니다. 위 예제에서는 async()에 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않아, content와 totalCount 쿼리가 모두 runBlocking의 컨텍스트인 동일한 스레드에서 실행됩니다. 이로 인해 한 쿼리의 작업이 완료되어야만 다음 쿼리가 실행되므로 전체 성능 저하와 응답성 저하가 발생할 수 있습니다.\n이를 해결하기 위해, 아래와 같이 async() 호출 시 Dispatchers.IO와 같은 I/O 전용 스레드 풀을 지정하면, 각 코루틴이 독립된 별도의 스레드에서 실행됩니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n\nval content: Deferred<List<Order>> = async(Dispatchers.IO) { ... }\nval totalCount: Deferred<Long> = async(Dispatchers.IO) { ... }\n\n\n이렇게 하면 JDBC 드라이버의 블록킹 특성에도 불구하고, 각 쿼리가 독립적으로 다른 스레드에서 병렬로 실행되므로, 한 쿼리의 블록킹이 다른 쿼리의 실행에 영향을 주지 않습니다. 실제로 이 방식으로 실행할 경우, 전체 성능이 크게 향상되어 병렬 처리의 이점을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n새롭게 추가된 로그 이미지를 보면, Main 코루틴은 여전히 동일한 스레드에서 실행되지만, content와 totalCount 코루틴은 각각 “DefaultDispatcher-worker-1” 및 “DefaultDispatcher-worker-3”과 같은 별도의 스레드에서 실행되어, 동시에 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 이와 같이, 블록킹 I/O가 발생하는 환경에서는 Dispatchers.IO를 활용하여 각 작업을 독립적인 스레드에서 처리하는 것이 전체 시스템의 응답성과 성능 개선에 효과적입니다.\n결론#\n이번 포스팅에서는 Kotlin 코루틴의 Dispatchers.IO가 어떻게 블록킹 I/O 작업, 특히 JDBC 드라이버나 파일 입출력과 같은 상황에서 전체 애플리케이션의 성능과 반응성을 개선하는 데 기여하는지 살펴보았습니다. 기본적으로 async()를 호출할 때 별도의 디스패처를 지정하지 않으면, 상위 코루틴의 컨텍스트를 그대로 상속받아 동일한 스레드에서 순차적으로 실행되기 때문에, 블록킹 작업이 발생할 경우 전체 실행 시간이 크게 늘어나는 문제가 발생합니다. 그러나, Dispatchers.IO를 지정하면 각 코루틴이 I/O 전용 스레드 풀의 독립된 스레드에서 실행되어, 한 작업의 블록킹이 다른 작업에 영향을 주지 않고 병렬 처리가 가능해집니다. 이를 통해 실제 작업에서는 전체 처리 시간이 단축되고, 시스템의 응답성이 크게 향상됨을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n이와 같이 Dispatchers.IO를 적절히 활용하면, 블록킹 I/O로 인한 성능 저하를 효과적으로 극복할 수 있으며, 효율적인 비동기 처리와 병렬 실행을 통해 더욱 안정적이고 반응성이 뛰어난 애플리케이션을 구현할 수 있습니다.",

(매출 성장률이 가속화되고 영업이익률이 확대되어) 펀더멘털이 분명히 개선되고 있어도 실제 실적이 ‘비공식적인’ 시장의 기대를 충족시키지 못한다면 주식은 하락할 수 있다. 이것이 스냅의 2019년 1분기 실적 발표와 추이의 2020년 1분기 실적 발표 때 일어났던 일이다. 기업공개 의무보호예수 해제처럼 펀더멘털 동향과 결부되지 않고 단기적인 주가 변동을 유발하는 이례적인 이벤트도 있을 수 있다. 2019년 11월 우버가 그런 사례였다. 과민 반응이나 단기적인 주가 변동 등의 이벤트 때문에 장기 투자를 단념하지 마라. 대신 실적 발표를 이용한 단기 투자에 대한 환상을 버려라..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-20퍼센트의-법칙과-2퍼센트의-법칙을-기억하라&quot;&gt;4. ‘20퍼센트의 법칙’과 ‘2퍼센트의 법칙’을 기억하라&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;장기적으로 펀더멘털은 주식을 움직이며 기술주의 경우 가장 중요한 펀더멘털은 매출, 매출, 매출이다. 매출이나 주요 고객 지표 측면에서 지속적으로 20퍼센트 이상의 성장률을 창출해내는 기업은 단기 수익성 전망에 관계없이 잠재적으로 양호한 주식 수익률을 제공할 수 있다. 이것이 내가 높은 성장률이라고 말하는 20퍼센트 매출 성장률의 ‘법칙’이다. 20퍼센트 이상의 일관된 매출 성장률은 S&amp;amp;P 500 기업의 매출 성장률보다 3~4배 높은 성과이며 지속하기 어렵다. 20퍼센트 이상의 일관된 매출 성장률은 종종 커다란 시장 기회, 끈질기고 성공적인 제품 혁신, 강력한 가치 제안, 최고의 경영진이 반영된 결과다. 그리고 이것이 장기적으로 좋은 투자 기회에서 투자자들이 찾아야 하는 요소다. 우선 다섯 분기 또는 여섯 분기 연속으로 20퍼센트 이상 성장률을 달성한 기업을 찾아라. 때때로 과거의 성과는 미래 성과를 보여주는 지표가 될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;가령 세 분기나 네 분기에 걸쳐 매출 성장률이 절반으로 감소하는 경우처럼 어떤 기업의 매출 성장률이 급격히 둔화된다면, 이 기업의 주가는 제대로 상승하지 못할 가능성이 높다. 특히  시장점유율 하락, 시장 포화, 경영진의 잘못된 경영이 성장률 둔화의 원인이라면 더욱 그렇다. 다만 코로나19 위기처럼 중대한 블랙 스완이 성장률 둔화의 원인이라면 문제가 다르다. 반대로 성장 곡선 증대 계획을 성공적으로 시행해 매출 성장률을 가속화한 기업은, 그렇지 않은 기업보다 높은 수익률을 창출할 수 있다. 성장 곡선 증대 계획은 특히 주가 상승에 큰 촉매제가 되므로 투자자는 이를 잘 활용해야 한다. 신제품 출시, 지리적 시장 확대, 가격 인상 등 성장 곡선 증대 계획이 효과를 발휘하면 매출 성장률이 가속화된다. 또 종종 마진 확대로 이어져 이익 성장 틈이 열리며 멀티플에 대한 재평가가 이루어진다. 그러므로 성장 곡선 증대 계획을 찾아라.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;성송적인 기술주 투자가 이익을 신경 쓰지 않는다는 뜻은 아니다. 수익성 없는 성장은 장기적으로 아무런 가치도 창출해내지 못한다. 그러나 지난 20년 동안 많은 주요 기술 기업의 역사를 보면 높은 매출 성장률은 미래의 수익성을 가리키는 훌륭한 지표였다. 매출이 커지면 회사는 대규모 고정비용에 대해 레버리지를 얻기 시작하거나 규모가 커지면서 공급 업체에 대한 레버리지를 확보하고, 증가된 경험과 규모를 통해 비용을 보다 효율적으로 관리할 수 있게 되어 단위 경제성을 개선할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-혁신은-그대로-숫자에-반영된다&quot;&gt;5. 혁신은 그대로 숫자에 반영된다&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제품 혁신은 중요하다. 성공적인 제품 혁신은 펀더멘털, 특히 매출을 성장시키는 가장 큰 원동력이며 주가를 움직이는 요인이다. 성공적인 제품 혁신은 완전히 새로운 매출원을 창출하기도 하고(아마존의 클라우드 컴퓨팅), 기존 매출원을 대체할 수도 있으며(넷플릭스의 DVD 사업과 스트리밍 서비스), 기존 매출원과 주요 고객 지표를 강화할 수도 있다(스포티파이의 팟캐스트, 스티치 픽스의 직접 구매 기능). 성공적인 제품 혁신은 발견할 수 있다면 시간이 지남에 따라 주가를 움직이는 중요한 동인이 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제품 혁신은 알아차릴 수 있다. 나를 포함한 몇몇 전문 투자자는 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 얼마나 혁신적인지, 얼마나 큰 시장 기회가 있는지 일찍부터 깨달았다. 아마존 웹 서비스가 출시된 후 몇 년 동안 클라우드 컴퓨팅은 트렌드로 널리 보도되었고, 투자자는 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 엄청난 기회가 될 거라는 사실과 이 서비스를 주도하는 회사가 처음에는 온라인 서점으로 유명했던 곳이라는 것을 알고 아마존이 혁신적인 회사라는 결론을 내리면 되었다. 넷플릭스의 스트리밍 혁신에 대한 실사 비용은 고작 7.99달려였다. 10년 전만 해도 거의 존재하지 않았던 에어비엔비, 도어대시, 리프트, 우버 같은 긱 이코노미(기업이 정규직보다 계약직이나 임시직으로 직원을 고용하는 경향이 커지는 것을 일컫는 용어) 기업을 생각해보면, 오늘날 일어나고 있는 가장 흥미로운 제품 혁신은 소비자 중심으로 이뤄진다고 할 수 있다. 여러분은 소비자다. 따라서 서비스를 이용해 보고 정말 마음에 드는 것을 찾았다면 그것이 훌륭한 투자 아이디어가 될 수 있다. 마지막으로 경쟁사가 어떤 회사의 혁신을 공격적으로 모방한다면 모방당한 기업은 진정한 혁신가일 가능성이 높다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제품 혁신은 반복해서 일어날 수 있다. 한 두 가지 인상적인 제품 혁신을 이루어낸 회사 또는 경영진은 계속해서 더 많은 혁신을 만들어낼 수 있다. 아마존 같은 회사가 온라인 쇼핑, 클라우드 컴퓨팅, 킨들을 ‘발명’했다면 성공적인 제품 혁신을 촉진하는 준비된 프로세스나 문화 또는 경영진이 있기 때문에 다른 분야(광고 매출이나 에코 기기, 계산원 없는 상점 등)에서도 혁신을 일으키기 쉽다. 언어로 된 오리지널 콘텐츠에 대해서도 성공적으로 혁신할 수 있을 것이다. 실제로도 넷플릭스는 그렇게 했다. 때로는 과거의 성공이 미래의 성과를 보여주는 지표가 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-주가는-결국-사이즈가-키운다&quot;&gt;6. 주가는 결국 사이즈가 키운다&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;총 도달 가능 시장의 규모가 크면 클수록 기술주와 성장주의 주요 동인의 높은 매출 성장률을 달성할 기회도 더 커진다. 제품의 혁신성, 고객에 대한 제품이나 상품의 강력한 가치 제안, 경영진의 능력 등 다른 중요한 요소가 많지만, 대규모 총 도달 가능 시장은 무엇보다 큰 성장을 이룰 기회를 가져온다. 1조 달러 규모의 총 도달 가능 시장(구글이 활약하고 있는 글로벌 광고 시장처럼)은 기업이 규모를 확장한 후에도 상당한 성장률을 달성할 기회를 제공할 수 있다. 1조 달러 규모의 총 도달 가능 시장을 확보한 기업은 매우 드물지만 ‘구글을 따라잡을 수 있는’, 즉 성장 이후에도 높은 매출 성장률을 창출할 수 있는 잠재력을 지닌 기업을 찾아야 한다. 이 때 큰 총 도달 가능 시장을 확보했지만 점유율이 한 자릿수인 기업이 이상적인 후보가 될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;총 도달 가능 시장은 확대될 수 있다. 불편함을 없애고 새로운 사용자 경험을 추가함으로써 총 도달 가능 시장이 확대될 수 있다. 이것이 리프트와 우버가 몇년 동안 해온 일이다. 우버는 가격을 낮추고, 플랫폼에 있는 드라이버 수를 늘리고, 대기 시간을 줄이고, 결제 시스템을 만들어 팁을 원활히 지급할수 있게 함으로써 결국 승차 공유의 사용자 경험과 편리성을 확장했다. 두 회사 모두 불편을 제거해 사용자 경험을 확장했고, 이에 따라 도달 가능한 승차 공유 시장도 커졌다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;총 도달 가능 시장을 확대하기 위해 기업이 취할 수 있는 구체적인 방법은 두 가지다. 새로운 지역으로 진출하는 것과 새로운 매출원을 창출하는 것이다. 2021년 초 현재 도어대시는 이 두 가지를 모두 진행하고 있다. 장기적으로 이 일에 성공한다면 기존 총 도달 가능 시장과 성장률의 잠재력에 큰 영향을 미칠 것이고, 따라서 주식시장에서도 성공하게 될 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;간혹 총 도달 시장은 특정하기가 어려운데, 전통적 산업이 파괴될 때 특히 그렇다. 이럴 때는 창의적이고 새로운 접근법이 필요하다. 스포티타이가 이런 사례다. 스포티파이는 음반 산업과 라디오 광고라는 익히 알려진 2개 시장을 공략했지만 그 방식은 처음 들었던 것보다 훨씬 더 큰 시장을 확보할 수 있는 것이었다. 스마트폰이 확산되면서 미디어 시장은 매우 크게 변화했고, 모든 미디어 모델의 총 도달 가능 시장이 확대되었다. 그리고 바로 이 지점에서 불편함이 제거되었다. 이제는 손쉽게 일주일에 24시간 동안 미디어를 소비할 수 있게 된 것이다. 최고의 미디어 서비스에 더 큰 시장 기회와 성장 기회가 주어졌다고 할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;총 도달 가능 시장 규모가 크면 성장을 촉진해 기업이 확장할 수 있으며, 여기에는 내재적 이익이 존재한다. 구체적으로 경험 곡선, 단위 경제성의 이점, 경제적 해자, 네트워크 효과라는 네 가지 이익이다. 규모가 커지면 더 똑똑하게 운영할 수 있는 학습 기회, 보다 비용 효과적으로 운영할 기회, 새로운 경쟁자의 진입 비용을 높일 기회, 네트워크 효과를 얻을 기회가 생긴다. 전부 다르지만 모두 규모의 이익이다. 규모는 경쟁에서의 승리를 가져다준다. 그러므로 총 도달 가능 시장이 크면 규모의 이익을 활용할 기회도 커진다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-투자자를-위하는-회사의-주식을-버려라&quot;&gt;7. 투자자를 위하는 회사의 주식을 버려라&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;지난 1년간 수익률이 가장 좋았던 종목은 단기적인 투자자의 관심사보다 ‘고객 만족’에 훨씬 더 큰 우선순위를 두는 기업이었다. 아마존이 전형적인 예다. 아마존은 단기적인 이익을 희생하더라도 보다 고객에게 매력적인 가치를 제공하기 위해 공격적으로 투자하겠다는 의지를 일관되게 보였다. 2005년 초 출시한 프라임 서비스가 대표적인 에다. 프라임 서비스를 도입하면서 아마존의 마진은 감소했고 자본적 지출은 2배 이상 증가했다. 하지만 그 덕분에 인터넷 역사상 고객 충성도가 가장 높은 프로그램이 나왔다. ‘쇼핑 역사상 가장 싼 제품’이기도 했다. 업계의 선도적인 고객 가치 제안을 유지하기 위해 꾸준히 개발하고 적극적으로 투자한 온라인 유통업체가 펀더멘털과 주가 수익률 측면에서 모두 승자가 된 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;투자자 중심적인 회사는 형편없는 투자를 한다. 이베이와 그럽허브는 수익성 높은 비즈니스 모델을 지키려는 욕구가 강해서 고객의 요구를 만족시키기 위한 혁신에 충분히 집중하지 않은 사례다. 그 때문에 결국 이베이와 그럽허브는 장기 투자자들에게 희비가 뒤섞인 결과를 제공하게 되었다. 그럽허브는 2016년 초부터 2018년 말까지 화려하게 상승했다. 이베이는 기업공개 후 5년 동안은 눈부신 성장률을 기록했고, 이후 5년 동안은 선택적으로 괜찮은 수익률을 기록했다. 하지만 두 기업의 가장 큰 경쟁자로 고객의 요구를 우선시했던 아마존과 도어대시가 획득한 놀라운 시장점유율과 시가총액을 생각하면, 이베이와 그럽허브가 얼마나 많은 것을 놓쳤는지 놀라게 된다. 나는 이 두 기업이나 투자자 중심적인 다른 기업에 관련해 게임이 아직 끝났다고 생각하지 않는다. 고객 중심 기업으로의 피벗은 비용도 많이 들고 어려운 일인데다 처음에는 주식시장에서 외면받을 가능성도 높다. 하지만 직접 매입으로 피벗한 질로가 증명하듯 성공할 수도 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;매력적인 고객 가치 제안을 개발하고 유지하는 데는 비용이 많이 들지만 결국 비즈니스 모델에 긍정적인 효과를 가져올 수 있다. 먼저 고객 충성도와 고객 유지율이 높아지고 이탈이 낮아지는 효과가 있다. 이는 모두 비즈니스 모델에 장기적으로 이익이 된다. 여기에 더해 매력적인 가치 제안으로 아마존과 넷플릭스도 도움을 받았던 가격 결정력의 플라이휠을 돌릴 수 있다. 소비자를 대상으로 사업 활동을 벌이는 기업이 가격 결정력을 갖춘 경우는 드물다. 상품이나 서비스에 돈을 더 지불하고 싶은 사람이 어디 있겠는가? 그러나 어떤 상품이나 서비스가 매력적이라면 소비자는 가격 인상을 받아들일 것이고, 기업은 가격을 인상함으로써 상품이나 서비스 개선에 다시 투자할 수 있는 선순환의 플라이휠을 돌리게 된다. 이를 통해 고객 중심 기업은 장기 투자자에게 높은 수익률을 안겨줄 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-사람을-보면-미래의-주가가-보인다&quot;&gt;8. 사람을 보면 미래의 주가가 보인다&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;경영진의 자질은 기술주 투자에서 가장 중요한 요소 중 하나다. 장기적으로 주식은 펀더멜털이 이끌고 펀터멘털은 경영진이 이끌기 때문이다. 경영진을 제대로 고른다면 주식을 제대로 고를 수 있다. 총 도달 가능 시장도 중요하다. 끊임없는 제품 혁신과 올바른 가치 제안도 마찬가지로 중요하다. 그러나 제품 혁신과 올바른 가치 제안을 관리하는 것이 경영진이다. 따라서 경영진을 제대로 고르면 그 기업은 펀더멘털이 좋을 가능성이 높고, 따라서 투자할 종목도 제대로 고르게 된다. 아마도 가장 중요한 주식 티커는 CEO일지도 모른다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;경영진에게서 따져봐야 할 요소는 다음과 같다. 창립자가 이끄는 회사인가(거의 모든 대형 기술주는 창립자가 이끄는 회사다)? 장기적 지향성을 지니고 있는가(저커버그의 1-5-10년 목표처럼)? 탁월한 산업 비전을 지니고 있는가(스트리밍 서비스를 시작한 헤이스팅스처럼)? 고객 만족에 집착하는가(아마존의 주주 서한)? 기술적 배경과 운영 능력이 있는가? 제품 혁신에 집중하는가? 인재를 영입하고 유지하는 능력이 있는가? 직원과 투자자에게 실수와 어려움을 솔직하게 털어놓을 수 있는 능력이 있는가? 한 기업의 경영진에게서 이 모든 요소를 찾기란 어려울 것이고 다 찾을 필요도 없다. 그러나 경영진의 자질을 신뢰하려면 이 요소 중 다수를 갖추고 있어야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;투자 펀드와 달리 경영진은  과거 성과가 미래 성과를 보여주는 지표가 된다. 그러니 성공적인 실적을 쌓아온 경영진을 찾았다면 그가 재임 중인 기업의 주식을 반드시 쥐고 있어라. 성공적인 실적을 냈다는 것은 월가의 분기 이익 추정치를 꾸준히 상회한다는 뜻이 아니다. 그것은 예상치를 관리하는 것이지 펀더멘털을 창출하는 것은 아니다. 성공적인 실적을 냈다는 것은 기막히게 멋진 주식 차트를 그렸다는 의미도 아니다. 단기적 주가 변동에는 수많은 요소가 영향을 미치기 때문이다. 성공적 실적이란 꾸준히 높은 매출 성장률을 달성하는 것, 성공적으로 새로운 상품과 기능 개선을 발표하는 것, 마지막으로 점점 더 큰 고객 만족과 충성도를 이끌어내는 것을 의미한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이러한 펀더멘털 측면의 성과와 그 성과를 이끌어낸 핵심 동인은 장기적으로 훌륭한 지식 차트를 그리게 할 가능성이 높다. 그리고이 부분에 대해 가장 큰 책임을 지는 주체는 바로 경영진이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-밸류에이션은-종목-선택의-절대적-기준이-아니다&quot;&gt;9. 밸류에이션은 종목 선택의 절대적 기준이 아니다&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;매수 종목을 선택하는 과정에서 밸류에이션이 가장 중요한 요소가 돼서는 안된다. 밸류에이션을 판단하는 프레임워크는 기술주를 고르는 데 도움을 주지만 밸류에이션은 과학이 아니며, 정확성을 띠는 것이 비현실적이거나 불가능하거나 정당하지 않을 때조차 정확한 답을 내놓는 정확성의 함정을 가져온다. 투자를 결정하는 질문은 기업이 탄탄한 이익을 창출하고 있는지, 최소한의 이익을 창출하고 있는지, 아니면 전혀 이익을 내지 못하고 있는지에 따라 달라진다. 하지만 언제나 가장 중요한 질문은 “현재 밸류에이션이 대략 합리적인 것처럼 보이는가?”가 되어야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;때때로 기술주는 비싸 보일 때가 있지만 그렇다고 나쁜 주식이 되는 것은 아니다. 진공 상태에서 PER은 그리 도움이 되지 않는다. PER은 성장성을 감안하고 봐야 한다. 자본 집약도와 현금 흐름이 비슷하다는 가정하에, 고성장 기업의 이익 흐름이 저성장 기업의 이익 흐름보다 더 크기 때문에 고성장주의 PER이 더 높은 것이 타당하다. 매출 성장과 영업이익률의 확대로 발생해 바로 잉여현긍흐름으로 전환되는 양질의 이익도 높은 PER을 보장한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;견조한 이익을 창출하는 기업의 경우 기업의 선행 EPS 성장률과 비슷하거나 약간의 프리미엄이 붙은 PER이 합리적이다. 예를 들어 EPS 성장률 전망이 20퍼센터인 회사는 PER 20배에서 30배 또는 40배까지 거래될 수 있으며, 이런 경우느 여전히 합리적으로 평가되었다고 여겨진다. 그러므로 투자를 결정하는 핵심적인 질문은 “이익 성장률이 얼마나 지속 가능한가?”다. 보기 드물게 높은 성장률인 20퍼센트 성장률을 얼마나 확신하는지, 기업의 총 도달 가능 시장-경영진-제품 혁신 수준-고객 가치 제안이 이 정도 성장을 뒷받침하는지 생각해봐야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;높은 성장률에 비해 싸게 거래되는 우량주는 장기 투자자에게 훌륭한 투자 대상이다. 이런 경우가 드물긴 하지만 존재하기는 한다. 프라이스라인과 페이스북은 오랜 기간 성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래되었고, 이는 두 종복에 대한 훌륭한 장기 투자 기회를 창출해냈다. 높은 성장률에 비해 싸게 거래되는 우량주는 투자자들에게 높은 매출 성장률이라는 동인을 제공하는 반면, PER이 낮아질 위험은 제한적이고 PER이 확대될 가능성은 높은 주식이다. 긍정적인 이중 효과가 있는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;최소한의 이익만 내는 기업은 PER이 매우 높은(40배 이상) 경우가 많지만 이런 주식도 여전히 좋은 투자 대상이 될 수 있다. 아마존과 넷플릭스가 그 증거다. 대규모 투자로 현재 이익이 크게 축소되고 있는가? 기업의 장기적인 영업이익률이 현재 수준보다 크게 높아질 거라고 생각할 만한 이유가 있는가? 이 회사는 상당한 기간에 높은 매출 성장률을 유지할 수 있는가? 이것이 투자를 결정하는 핵심적인 질문들이다. 이 질문들에 대한 대답이 긍정적이라면 엄청나게 높은 PER도 정당화될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이익을 내지 못한는 기업의 경우 밸류에이션을 평가하기가 가장 어렵지만 네가지 타당성 테스트와 매출(주가매출액비율) 같은 요소를 바탕으로 한 밸류에이션 비교를 통해 배률에이션의 합리성을 판단할 수 있다. 현재 이익을 내지 못하는 기업을 평가할 때 이용할 수 있는 네 가지 타당성 테스트는 다음과 같다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;비슷한 비즈니스 모델로 이익을 내는 상장 기업이 있는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;회가 전체적으로 수익성이 높지 않다면 사업 내에 수익성이 있는 다른 부문이 있는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;규모가 기업을 수익성으로 이끌지 못하는 이유가 있는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;수익성을 높이기 위해 경영진이 취할 수 있는 구체적인 조치가 있는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-이탈한-우량주를-사냥하라-맹렬하게&quot;&gt;10. 이탈한 우량주를 사냥하라, 맹렬하게&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이탈한 우량주를 찾아라. 고성장 기술주 투자자로서 돈을 벌 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법 중 하나는 우량주를 찾아 이들이 이탈했을 때 매수하거나 포지션을 늘리는 것이다. 높은매출 성장률, 넓은 총 도달 가능 시장, 끊임없는 제품 혁신과 매력적인 고객 가치 제안, 뛰어난 경영진을 갖춘 우량 기업에 투자하면 펀더멘털 위험이 줄어든다. 우량한 기업이 이탈했을 때, 즉 주가가 20~30퍼센트 하락했을 때나 성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래될 때 매수한다면 밸류에이션 멀티플 위험이 줄어든다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;언제가 주식이 이탈한 때인가? 이에 관련해 두 가지 경험칙이 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;주가가 20~30퍼센트 하락했을 때&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래될 때, 즉 PER 배수가 예상 EPS 성장률보다 낮은 경우 또는 PEG &amp;lt; 1인 경우&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;약간의 추가적인 판단이 필요하다. 예를 들어 3개월 동안 100퍼센트 급등한 후 20퍼센트 하락했다면 이탈한 주식이라고 볼 수 없다. 그러나 이러한 규칙은 이탈한 주식을 알아보는 데 도움이 된다. 경험상 모든 우량 기업은 어느 순간 이탈해서 인내심 있는 장기 투자자들에게 큰 기회를 제공하는 때가 있었다. 심지어 내가 지난 5년 동안 분석해온 우량주(페이스북, 아마존, 넷플릭스, 구글)도 해당 기간에 몇 번씩 이탈했다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;경험 많은 기술주 애널리스트의 관점에서 봤을때 우량주임을 알 수 있는 가장 확실한 펀더멘털 증거는 일관되게 매출 성장률(20퍼센트 이상)이다. 그리고 높은 매출 성장률은 끊임없는 제품 혁신, 넓은 총 도달 가능 시장, 매력적인 고객 가치 제안, 훌륭한 경영진이라는 네 가지 핵심적인 요소가 이끈다. 바로 이것들이 회사의 장기적인 펀더멘탈 전망을 결정하는 데 있어 가장 중요한 요소다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;내가 알아낸 가장 중요한 매도 지표는 펀더멘털의 상당한 악화다. 보다 구체적으로 말하자면 매출 성장률이 크게 둔화될 때(코로나19 팬데믹 같은 거시적 충격 없이 1년 이내 50퍼센트 감소)나, 또는 업계와 거시 경제에 일어난 충격을 감안하고 매출 성장률이 20퍼센트 이하로 현저히 하락할 때다. 이런 지표는 특히 고성장 기술주에 적용되지만 매출 성장률이 크게 감소했을 때 장기간 시장 대비 높은 수익률을 보이던 주식이 시장 대비 낮은 수익률을 보이게 된 경우는 상당히 많다. 부킹, 크리테오, 이베이, 스냅, 셔터스톡, 트립어드바이저, 트루카, 트위터, 야후, 옐프 등이 여기에 해당한다. 그러므로 기술주 투자자는 기업의 매출 성장률에 급격히 둔화되는 것을 경계해야 한다. 성장은 설렌다. 하지만 (상당한) 둔화는 주가를 죽인다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n            \n          ",

(매출 성장률이 가속화되고 영업이익률이 확대되어) 펀더멘털이 분명히 개선되고 있어도 실제 실적이 ‘비공식적인’ 시장의 기대를 충족시키지 못한다면 주식은 하락할 수 있다. 이것이 스냅의 2019년 1분기 실적 발표와 추이의 2020년 1분기 실적 발표 때 일어났던 일이다. 기업공개 의무보호예수 해제처럼 펀더멘털 동향과 결부되지 않고 단기적인 주가 변동을 유발하는 이례적인 이벤트도 있을 수 있다. 2019년 11월 우버가 그런 사례였다. 과민 반응이나 단기적인 주가 변동 등의 이벤트 때문에 장기 투자를 단념하지 마라. 대신 실적 발표를 이용한 단기 투자에 대한 환상을 버려라..</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"4-20퍼센트의-법칙과-2퍼센트의-법칙을-기억하라\">4. ‘20퍼센트의 법칙’과 ‘2퍼센트의 법칙’을 기억하라</h3>\n\n<p>장기적으로 펀더멘털은 주식을 움직이며 기술주의 경우 가장 중요한 펀더멘털은 매출, 매출, 매출이다. 매출이나 주요 고객 지표 측면에서 지속적으로 20퍼센트 이상의 성장률을 창출해내는 기업은 단기 수익성 전망에 관계없이 잠재적으로 양호한 주식 수익률을 제공할 수 있다. 이것이 내가 높은 성장률이라고 말하는 20퍼센트 매출 성장률의 ‘법칙’이다. 20퍼센트 이상의 일관된 매출 성장률은 S&amp;P 500 기업의 매출 성장률보다 3~4배 높은 성과이며 지속하기 어렵다. 20퍼센트 이상의 일관된 매출 성장률은 종종 커다란 시장 기회, 끈질기고 성공적인 제품 혁신, 강력한 가치 제안, 최고의 경영진이 반영된 결과다. 그리고 이것이 장기적으로 좋은 투자 기회에서 투자자들이 찾아야 하는 요소다. 우선 다섯 분기 또는 여섯 분기 연속으로 20퍼센트 이상 성장률을 달성한 기업을 찾아라. 때때로 과거의 성과는 미래 성과를 보여주는 지표가 될 수 있다.</p>\n\n<p>가령 세 분기나 네 분기에 걸쳐 매출 성장률이 절반으로 감소하는 경우처럼 어떤 기업의 매출 성장률이 급격히 둔화된다면, 이 기업의 주가는 제대로 상승하지 못할 가능성이 높다. 특히  시장점유율 하락, 시장 포화, 경영진의 잘못된 경영이 성장률 둔화의 원인이라면 더욱 그렇다. 다만 코로나19 위기처럼 중대한 블랙 스완이 성장률 둔화의 원인이라면 문제가 다르다. 반대로 성장 곡선 증대 계획을 성공적으로 시행해 매출 성장률을 가속화한 기업은, 그렇지 않은 기업보다 높은 수익률을 창출할 수 있다. 성장 곡선 증대 계획은 특히 주가 상승에 큰 촉매제가 되므로 투자자는 이를 잘 활용해야 한다. 신제품 출시, 지리적 시장 확대, 가격 인상 등 성장 곡선 증대 계획이 효과를 발휘하면 매출 성장률이 가속화된다. 또 종종 마진 확대로 이어져 이익 성장 틈이 열리며 멀티플에 대한 재평가가 이루어진다. 그러므로 성장 곡선 증대 계획을 찾아라.</p>\n\n<p>성송적인 기술주 투자가 이익을 신경 쓰지 않는다는 뜻은 아니다. 수익성 없는 성장은 장기적으로 아무런 가치도 창출해내지 못한다. 그러나 지난 20년 동안 많은 주요 기술 기업의 역사를 보면 높은 매출 성장률은 미래의 수익성을 가리키는 훌륭한 지표였다. 매출이 커지면 회사는 대규모 고정비용에 대해 레버리지를 얻기 시작하거나 규모가 커지면서 공급 업체에 대한 레버리지를 확보하고, 증가된 경험과 규모를 통해 비용을 보다 효율적으로 관리할 수 있게 되어 단위 경제성을 개선할 수 있다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"5-혁신은-그대로-숫자에-반영된다\">5. 혁신은 그대로 숫자에 반영된다</h3>\n\n<p>제품 혁신은 중요하다. 성공적인 제품 혁신은 펀더멘털, 특히 매출을 성장시키는 가장 큰 원동력이며 주가를 움직이는 요인이다. 성공적인 제품 혁신은 완전히 새로운 매출원을 창출하기도 하고(아마존의 클라우드 컴퓨팅), 기존 매출원을 대체할 수도 있으며(넷플릭스의 DVD 사업과 스트리밍 서비스), 기존 매출원과 주요 고객 지표를 강화할 수도 있다(스포티파이의 팟캐스트, 스티치 픽스의 직접 구매 기능). 성공적인 제품 혁신은 발견할 수 있다면 시간이 지남에 따라 주가를 움직이는 중요한 동인이 된다.</p>\n\n<p>제품 혁신은 알아차릴 수 있다. 나를 포함한 몇몇 전문 투자자는 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 얼마나 혁신적인지, 얼마나 큰 시장 기회가 있는지 일찍부터 깨달았다. 아마존 웹 서비스가 출시된 후 몇 년 동안 클라우드 컴퓨팅은 트렌드로 널리 보도되었고, 투자자는 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 엄청난 기회가 될 거라는 사실과 이 서비스를 주도하는 회사가 처음에는 온라인 서점으로 유명했던 곳이라는 것을 알고 아마존이 혁신적인 회사라는 결론을 내리면 되었다. 넷플릭스의 스트리밍 혁신에 대한 실사 비용은 고작 7.99달려였다. 10년 전만 해도 거의 존재하지 않았던 에어비엔비, 도어대시, 리프트, 우버 같은 긱 이코노미(기업이 정규직보다 계약직이나 임시직으로 직원을 고용하는 경향이 커지는 것을 일컫는 용어) 기업을 생각해보면, 오늘날 일어나고 있는 가장 흥미로운 제품 혁신은 소비자 중심으로 이뤄진다고 할 수 있다. 여러분은 소비자다. 따라서 서비스를 이용해 보고 정말 마음에 드는 것을 찾았다면 그것이 훌륭한 투자 아이디어가 될 수 있다. 마지막으로 경쟁사가 어떤 회사의 혁신을 공격적으로 모방한다면 모방당한 기업은 진정한 혁신가일 가능성이 높다.</p>\n\n<p>제품 혁신은 반복해서 일어날 수 있다. 한 두 가지 인상적인 제품 혁신을 이루어낸 회사 또는 경영진은 계속해서 더 많은 혁신을 만들어낼 수 있다. 아마존 같은 회사가 온라인 쇼핑, 클라우드 컴퓨팅, 킨들을 ‘발명’했다면 성공적인 제품 혁신을 촉진하는 준비된 프로세스나 문화 또는 경영진이 있기 때문에 다른 분야(광고 매출이나 에코 기기, 계산원 없는 상점 등)에서도 혁신을 일으키기 쉽다. 언어로 된 오리지널 콘텐츠에 대해서도 성공적으로 혁신할 수 있을 것이다. 실제로도 넷플릭스는 그렇게 했다. 때로는 과거의 성공이 미래의 성과를 보여주는 지표가 된다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"6-주가는-결국-사이즈가-키운다\">6. 주가는 결국 사이즈가 키운다</h3>\n\n<p>총 도달 가능 시장의 규모가 크면 클수록 기술주와 성장주의 주요 동인의 높은 매출 성장률을 달성할 기회도 더 커진다. 제품의 혁신성, 고객에 대한 제품이나 상품의 강력한 가치 제안, 경영진의 능력 등 다른 중요한 요소가 많지만, 대규모 총 도달 가능 시장은 무엇보다 큰 성장을 이룰 기회를 가져온다. 1조 달러 규모의 총 도달 가능 시장(구글이 활약하고 있는 글로벌 광고 시장처럼)은 기업이 규모를 확장한 후에도 상당한 성장률을 달성할 기회를 제공할 수 있다. 1조 달러 규모의 총 도달 가능 시장을 확보한 기업은 매우 드물지만 ‘구글을 따라잡을 수 있는’, 즉 성장 이후에도 높은 매출 성장률을 창출할 수 있는 잠재력을 지닌 기업을 찾아야 한다. 이 때 큰 총 도달 가능 시장을 확보했지만 점유율이 한 자릿수인 기업이 이상적인 후보가 될 수 있다.</p>\n\n<p>총 도달 가능 시장은 확대될 수 있다. 불편함을 없애고 새로운 사용자 경험을 추가함으로써 총 도달 가능 시장이 확대될 수 있다. 이것이 리프트와 우버가 몇년 동안 해온 일이다. 우버는 가격을 낮추고, 플랫폼에 있는 드라이버 수를 늘리고, 대기 시간을 줄이고, 결제 시스템을 만들어 팁을 원활히 지급할수 있게 함으로써 결국 승차 공유의 사용자 경험과 편리성을 확장했다. 두 회사 모두 불편을 제거해 사용자 경험을 확장했고, 이에 따라 도달 가능한 승차 공유 시장도 커졌다.</p>\n\n<p>총 도달 가능 시장을 확대하기 위해 기업이 취할 수 있는 구체적인 방법은 두 가지다. 새로운 지역으로 진출하는 것과 새로운 매출원을 창출하는 것이다. 2021년 초 현재 도어대시는 이 두 가지를 모두 진행하고 있다. 장기적으로 이 일에 성공한다면 기존 총 도달 가능 시장과 성장률의 잠재력에 큰 영향을 미칠 것이고, 따라서 주식시장에서도 성공하게 될 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>간혹 총 도달 시장은 특정하기가 어려운데, 전통적 산업이 파괴될 때 특히 그렇다. 이럴 때는 창의적이고 새로운 접근법이 필요하다. 스포티타이가 이런 사례다. 스포티파이는 음반 산업과 라디오 광고라는 익히 알려진 2개 시장을 공략했지만 그 방식은 처음 들었던 것보다 훨씬 더 큰 시장을 확보할 수 있는 것이었다. 스마트폰이 확산되면서 미디어 시장은 매우 크게 변화했고, 모든 미디어 모델의 총 도달 가능 시장이 확대되었다. 그리고 바로 이 지점에서 불편함이 제거되었다. 이제는 손쉽게 일주일에 24시간 동안 미디어를 소비할 수 있게 된 것이다. 최고의 미디어 서비스에 더 큰 시장 기회와 성장 기회가 주어졌다고 할 수 있다.</p>\n\n<p>총 도달 가능 시장 규모가 크면 성장을 촉진해 기업이 확장할 수 있으며, 여기에는 내재적 이익이 존재한다. 구체적으로 경험 곡선, 단위 경제성의 이점, 경제적 해자, 네트워크 효과라는 네 가지 이익이다. 규모가 커지면 더 똑똑하게 운영할 수 있는 학습 기회, 보다 비용 효과적으로 운영할 기회, 새로운 경쟁자의 진입 비용을 높일 기회, 네트워크 효과를 얻을 기회가 생긴다. 전부 다르지만 모두 규모의 이익이다. 규모는 경쟁에서의 승리를 가져다준다. 그러므로 총 도달 가능 시장이 크면 규모의 이익을 활용할 기회도 커진다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"7-투자자를-위하는-회사의-주식을-버려라\">7. 투자자를 위하는 회사의 주식을 버려라</h3>\n\n<p>지난 1년간 수익률이 가장 좋았던 종목은 단기적인 투자자의 관심사보다 ‘고객 만족’에 훨씬 더 큰 우선순위를 두는 기업이었다. 아마존이 전형적인 예다. 아마존은 단기적인 이익을 희생하더라도 보다 고객에게 매력적인 가치를 제공하기 위해 공격적으로 투자하겠다는 의지를 일관되게 보였다. 2005년 초 출시한 프라임 서비스가 대표적인 에다. 프라임 서비스를 도입하면서 아마존의 마진은 감소했고 자본적 지출은 2배 이상 증가했다. 하지만 그 덕분에 인터넷 역사상 고객 충성도가 가장 높은 프로그램이 나왔다. ‘쇼핑 역사상 가장 싼 제품’이기도 했다. 업계의 선도적인 고객 가치 제안을 유지하기 위해 꾸준히 개발하고 적극적으로 투자한 온라인 유통업체가 펀더멘털과 주가 수익률 측면에서 모두 승자가 된 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>투자자 중심적인 회사는 형편없는 투자를 한다. 이베이와 그럽허브는 수익성 높은 비즈니스 모델을 지키려는 욕구가 강해서 고객의 요구를 만족시키기 위한 혁신에 충분히 집중하지 않은 사례다. 그 때문에 결국 이베이와 그럽허브는 장기 투자자들에게 희비가 뒤섞인 결과를 제공하게 되었다. 그럽허브는 2016년 초부터 2018년 말까지 화려하게 상승했다. 이베이는 기업공개 후 5년 동안은 눈부신 성장률을 기록했고, 이후 5년 동안은 선택적으로 괜찮은 수익률을 기록했다. 하지만 두 기업의 가장 큰 경쟁자로 고객의 요구를 우선시했던 아마존과 도어대시가 획득한 놀라운 시장점유율과 시가총액을 생각하면, 이베이와 그럽허브가 얼마나 많은 것을 놓쳤는지 놀라게 된다. 나는 이 두 기업이나 투자자 중심적인 다른 기업에 관련해 게임이 아직 끝났다고 생각하지 않는다. 고객 중심 기업으로의 피벗은 비용도 많이 들고 어려운 일인데다 처음에는 주식시장에서 외면받을 가능성도 높다. 하지만 직접 매입으로 피벗한 질로가 증명하듯 성공할 수도 있다.</p>\n\n<p>매력적인 고객 가치 제안을 개발하고 유지하는 데는 비용이 많이 들지만 결국 비즈니스 모델에 긍정적인 효과를 가져올 수 있다. 먼저 고객 충성도와 고객 유지율이 높아지고 이탈이 낮아지는 효과가 있다. 이는 모두 비즈니스 모델에 장기적으로 이익이 된다. 여기에 더해 매력적인 가치 제안으로 아마존과 넷플릭스도 도움을 받았던 가격 결정력의 플라이휠을 돌릴 수 있다. 소비자를 대상으로 사업 활동을 벌이는 기업이 가격 결정력을 갖춘 경우는 드물다. 상품이나 서비스에 돈을 더 지불하고 싶은 사람이 어디 있겠는가? 그러나 어떤 상품이나 서비스가 매력적이라면 소비자는 가격 인상을 받아들일 것이고, 기업은 가격을 인상함으로써 상품이나 서비스 개선에 다시 투자할 수 있는 선순환의 플라이휠을 돌리게 된다. 이를 통해 고객 중심 기업은 장기 투자자에게 높은 수익률을 안겨줄 수 있다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"8-사람을-보면-미래의-주가가-보인다\">8. 사람을 보면 미래의 주가가 보인다</h3>\n\n<p>경영진의 자질은 기술주 투자에서 가장 중요한 요소 중 하나다. 장기적으로 주식은 펀더멜털이 이끌고 펀터멘털은 경영진이 이끌기 때문이다. 경영진을 제대로 고른다면 주식을 제대로 고를 수 있다. 총 도달 가능 시장도 중요하다. 끊임없는 제품 혁신과 올바른 가치 제안도 마찬가지로 중요하다. 그러나 제품 혁신과 올바른 가치 제안을 관리하는 것이 경영진이다. 따라서 경영진을 제대로 고르면 그 기업은 펀더멘털이 좋을 가능성이 높고, 따라서 투자할 종목도 제대로 고르게 된다. 아마도 가장 중요한 주식 티커는 CEO일지도 모른다.</p>\n\n<p>경영진에게서 따져봐야 할 요소는 다음과 같다. 창립자가 이끄는 회사인가(거의 모든 대형 기술주는 창립자가 이끄는 회사다)? 장기적 지향성을 지니고 있는가(저커버그의 1-5-10년 목표처럼)? 탁월한 산업 비전을 지니고 있는가(스트리밍 서비스를 시작한 헤이스팅스처럼)? 고객 만족에 집착하는가(아마존의 주주 서한)? 기술적 배경과 운영 능력이 있는가? 제품 혁신에 집중하는가? 인재를 영입하고 유지하는 능력이 있는가? 직원과 투자자에게 실수와 어려움을 솔직하게 털어놓을 수 있는 능력이 있는가? 한 기업의 경영진에게서 이 모든 요소를 찾기란 어려울 것이고 다 찾을 필요도 없다. 그러나 경영진의 자질을 신뢰하려면 이 요소 중 다수를 갖추고 있어야 한다.</p>\n\n<p>투자 펀드와 달리 경영진은  과거 성과가 미래 성과를 보여주는 지표가 된다. 그러니 성공적인 실적을 쌓아온 경영진을 찾았다면 그가 재임 중인 기업의 주식을 반드시 쥐고 있어라. 성공적인 실적을 냈다는 것은 월가의 분기 이익 추정치를 꾸준히 상회한다는 뜻이 아니다. 그것은 예상치를 관리하는 것이지 펀더멘털을 창출하는 것은 아니다. 성공적인 실적을 냈다는 것은 기막히게 멋진 주식 차트를 그렸다는 의미도 아니다. 단기적 주가 변동에는 수많은 요소가 영향을 미치기 때문이다. 성공적 실적이란 꾸준히 높은 매출 성장률을 달성하는 것, 성공적으로 새로운 상품과 기능 개선을 발표하는 것, 마지막으로 점점 더 큰 고객 만족과 충성도를 이끌어내는 것을 의미한다.</p>\n\n<p>이러한 펀더멘털 측면의 성과와 그 성과를 이끌어낸 핵심 동인은 장기적으로 훌륭한 지식 차트를 그리게 할 가능성이 높다. 그리고이 부분에 대해 가장 큰 책임을 지는 주체는 바로 경영진이다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"9-밸류에이션은-종목-선택의-절대적-기준이-아니다\">9. 밸류에이션은 종목 선택의 절대적 기준이 아니다</h3>\n\n<p>매수 종목을 선택하는 과정에서 밸류에이션이 가장 중요한 요소가 돼서는 안된다. 밸류에이션을 판단하는 프레임워크는 기술주를 고르는 데 도움을 주지만 밸류에이션은 과학이 아니며, 정확성을 띠는 것이 비현실적이거나 불가능하거나 정당하지 않을 때조차 정확한 답을 내놓는 정확성의 함정을 가져온다. 투자를 결정하는 질문은 기업이 탄탄한 이익을 창출하고 있는지, 최소한의 이익을 창출하고 있는지, 아니면 전혀 이익을 내지 못하고 있는지에 따라 달라진다. 하지만 언제나 가장 중요한 질문은 “현재 밸류에이션이 대략 합리적인 것처럼 보이는가?”가 되어야 한다.</p>\n\n<p>때때로 기술주는 비싸 보일 때가 있지만 그렇다고 나쁜 주식이 되는 것은 아니다. 진공 상태에서 PER은 그리 도움이 되지 않는다. PER은 성장성을 감안하고 봐야 한다. 자본 집약도와 현금 흐름이 비슷하다는 가정하에, 고성장 기업의 이익 흐름이 저성장 기업의 이익 흐름보다 더 크기 때문에 고성장주의 PER이 더 높은 것이 타당하다. 매출 성장과 영업이익률의 확대로 발생해 바로 잉여현긍흐름으로 전환되는 양질의 이익도 높은 PER을 보장한다.</p>\n\n<p>견조한 이익을 창출하는 기업의 경우 기업의 선행 EPS 성장률과 비슷하거나 약간의 프리미엄이 붙은 PER이 합리적이다. 예를 들어 EPS 성장률 전망이 20퍼센터인 회사는 PER 20배에서 30배 또는 40배까지 거래될 수 있으며, 이런 경우느 여전히 합리적으로 평가되었다고 여겨진다. 그러므로 투자를 결정하는 핵심적인 질문은 “이익 성장률이 얼마나 지속 가능한가?”다. 보기 드물게 높은 성장률인 20퍼센트 성장률을 얼마나 확신하는지, 기업의 총 도달 가능 시장-경영진-제품 혁신 수준-고객 가치 제안이 이 정도 성장을 뒷받침하는지 생각해봐야 한다.</p>\n\n<p>높은 성장률에 비해 싸게 거래되는 우량주는 장기 투자자에게 훌륭한 투자 대상이다. 이런 경우가 드물긴 하지만 존재하기는 한다. 프라이스라인과 페이스북은 오랜 기간 성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래되었고, 이는 두 종복에 대한 훌륭한 장기 투자 기회를 창출해냈다. 높은 성장률에 비해 싸게 거래되는 우량주는 투자자들에게 높은 매출 성장률이라는 동인을 제공하는 반면, PER이 낮아질 위험은 제한적이고 PER이 확대될 가능성은 높은 주식이다. 긍정적인 이중 효과가 있는 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>최소한의 이익만 내는 기업은 PER이 매우 높은(40배 이상) 경우가 많지만 이런 주식도 여전히 좋은 투자 대상이 될 수 있다. 아마존과 넷플릭스가 그 증거다. 대규모 투자로 현재 이익이 크게 축소되고 있는가? 기업의 장기적인 영업이익률이 현재 수준보다 크게 높아질 거라고 생각할 만한 이유가 있는가? 이 회사는 상당한 기간에 높은 매출 성장률을 유지할 수 있는가? 이것이 투자를 결정하는 핵심적인 질문들이다. 이 질문들에 대한 대답이 긍정적이라면 엄청나게 높은 PER도 정당화될 수 있다.</p>\n\n<p>이익을 내지 못한는 기업의 경우 밸류에이션을 평가하기가 가장 어렵지만 네가지 타당성 테스트와 매출(주가매출액비율) 같은 요소를 바탕으로 한 밸류에이션 비교를 통해 배률에이션의 합리성을 판단할 수 있다. 현재 이익을 내지 못하는 기업을 평가할 때 이용할 수 있는 네 가지 타당성 테스트는 다음과 같다.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>비슷한 비즈니스 모델로 이익을 내는 상장 기업이 있는가?</li>\n  <li>회가 전체적으로 수익성이 높지 않다면 사업 내에 수익성이 있는 다른 부문이 있는가?</li>\n  <li>규모가 기업을 수익성으로 이끌지 못하는 이유가 있는가?</li>\n  <li>수익성을 높이기 위해 경영진이 취할 수 있는 구체적인 조치가 있는가?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"10-이탈한-우량주를-사냥하라-맹렬하게\">10. 이탈한 우량주를 사냥하라, 맹렬하게</h3>\n\n<p>이탈한 우량주를 찾아라. 고성장 기술주 투자자로서 돈을 벌 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법 중 하나는 우량주를 찾아 이들이 이탈했을 때 매수하거나 포지션을 늘리는 것이다. 높은매출 성장률, 넓은 총 도달 가능 시장, 끊임없는 제품 혁신과 매력적인 고객 가치 제안, 뛰어난 경영진을 갖춘 우량 기업에 투자하면 펀더멘털 위험이 줄어든다. 우량한 기업이 이탈했을 때, 즉 주가가 20~30퍼센트 하락했을 때나 성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래될 때 매수한다면 밸류에이션 멀티플 위험이 줄어든다.</p>\n\n<p>언제가 주식이 이탈한 때인가? 이에 관련해 두 가지 경험칙이 있다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>주가가 20~30퍼센트 하락했을 때</li>\n  <li>성장률에 비해 할인된 가격으로 거래될 때, 즉 PER 배수가 예상 EPS 성장률보다 낮은 경우 또는 PEG &lt; 1인 경우</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>약간의 추가적인 판단이 필요하다. 예를 들어 3개월 동안 100퍼센트 급등한 후 20퍼센트 하락했다면 이탈한 주식이라고 볼 수 없다. 그러나 이러한 규칙은 이탈한 주식을 알아보는 데 도움이 된다. 경험상 모든 우량 기업은 어느 순간 이탈해서 인내심 있는 장기 투자자들에게 큰 기회를 제공하는 때가 있었다. 심지어 내가 지난 5년 동안 분석해온 우량주(페이스북, 아마존, 넷플릭스, 구글)도 해당 기간에 몇 번씩 이탈했다.</p>\n\n<p>경험 많은 기술주 애널리스트의 관점에서 봤을때 우량주임을 알 수 있는 가장 확실한 펀더멘털 증거는 일관되게 매출 성장률(20퍼센트 이상)이다. 그리고 높은 매출 성장률은 끊임없는 제품 혁신, 넓은 총 도달 가능 시장, 매력적인 고객 가치 제안, 훌륭한 경영진이라는 네 가지 핵심적인 요소가 이끈다. 바로 이것들이 회사의 장기적인 펀더멘탈 전망을 결정하는 데 있어 가장 중요한 요소다.</p>\n\n<p>내가 알아낸 가장 중요한 매도 지표는 펀더멘털의 상당한 악화다. 보다 구체적으로 말하자면 매출 성장률이 크게 둔화될 때(코로나19 팬데믹 같은 거시적 충격 없이 1년 이내 50퍼센트 감소)나, 또는 업계와 거시 경제에 일어난 충격을 감안하고 매출 성장률이 20퍼센트 이하로 현저히 하락할 때다. 이런 지표는 특히 고성장 기술주에 적용되지만 매출 성장률이 크게 감소했을 때 장기간 시장 대비 높은 수익률을 보이던 주식이 시장 대비 낮은 수익률을 보이게 된 경우는 상당히 많다. 부킹, 크리테오, 이베이, 스냅, 셔터스톡, 트립어드바이저, 트루카, 트위터, 야후, 옐프 등이 여기에 해당한다. 그러므로 기술주 투자자는 기업의 매출 성장률에 급격히 둔화되는 것을 경계해야 한다. 성장은 설렌다. 하지만 (상당한) 둔화는 주가를 죽인다.</p>",

data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">티스토리의 미래가 불안하다는 소식이 들리면서부터 '이제 어디로 가야 하나' 하는 고민이 시작됐어요. 여러분도 비슷한 고민하고 계시죠? 오늘은 제가 여러 블로그 플랫폼을 직접 사용해보고 비교 분석한 내용을 솔직하게 공유해 드릴게요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  티스토리 이사를 고민해야 할 신호들</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">티스토리가 당장 문을 닫진 않겠지만, 몇 가지 불안한 징후들이 나타나고 있어요. 이런 신호들이 보인다면 슬슬 대안을 준비해야 할 때입니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>플랫폼 불안정성의 징후</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">요즘 티스토리에 로그인하려면 가끔 오류가 뜨더라고요. 글 작성 중에 튕기는 경우도 있고, 이미지 업로드가 예전보다 확실히 느려진 것 같아요. 이런 사소한 문제들이 쌓이다 보면 결국 큰 문제로 이어질 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">더 걱정되는 건, 관리자 측의 공지가 점점 줄어들고 있다는 점이에요. 예전엔 업데이트나 변화에 대해 미리 알려주곤 했는데, 요즘은 갑자기 바뀌어 있는 경우가 많아요. 고객센터 응답도 전보다 느려진 것 같고요.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>SEO 및 트래픽 감소</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">제 블로그는 2년 전부터 네이버와 구글 검색 노출이 점점 줄어들고 있어요. 똑같은 콘텐츠 품질인데도 검색 순위가 자꾸 밀리는 느낌이랄까? 특히 네이버는 자사 블로그 우대 정책이 강화되면서 티스토리 블로그의 상위 노출이 점점 어려워지고 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 검색 노출 감소는 당연히 광고 수익 감소로 이어지죠. 방문자 수가 줄면 애드센스 수익도 감소하니까요. 블로그로 부수입을 올리시는 분들이라면 이 부분이 특히 고민될 거예요.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>유료화 정책 도입 가능성</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">솔직히 말해서, 유료화는 피할 수 없는 흐름인 것 같아요. 문제는 그 비용이 얼마나 될지, 그리고 무료 버전에선 어떤 기능이 제한될지예요. 만약 티스토리가 주요 기능을 대부분 유료로 전환한다면, 블로그 수익보다 유지비가 더 나올 수도 있잖아요?</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 세 가지 중에서 <b>두 가지 이상 해당된다면</b>, 다른 플랫폼으로의 이전을 진지하게 고민해볼 때예요. 당장 무언가를 결정하기보다는, 천천히 대안을 탐색해보는 과정이 필요할 것 같습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  티스토리 대체 플랫폼 5곳 비교</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 직접 사용해본 5개의 플랫폼을 비교해봤어요. 각각의 특징과 장단점을 솔직하게 분석했습니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>1️⃣ 네이버 블로그</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">네이버 블로그는 국내 검색 점유율 1위 포털에서 운영하는 만큼, 검색 최적화에 최고의 강점을 가지고 있어요. 특히 네이버 검색에서는 자사 플랫폼 우대 정책이 있어서 검색 유입에 확실히 유리합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>네이버 검색 노출이 압도적으로 유리</li>\n<li>대부분의 사용자에게 친숙한 인터페이스</li>\n<li>스마트에디터가 직관적이고 사용하기 쉬움</li>\n<li>네이버 아이디로 쉽게 시작할 수 있음</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>구글 애드센스 연동이 불가능해 수익화에 제한</li>\n<li>디자인 자유도가 낮고 템플릿이 제한적</li>\n<li>네이버의 정책 변화에 취약함</li>\n<li>타 플랫폼에 비해 전문적인 기능이 부족</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">실제로 제 지인 중에는 티스토리에서 네이버로 옮긴 후 트래픽이 3배 이상 증가했다는 분도 있어요. 검색 최적화가 우선이라면 고려해볼 만한 옵션입니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>2️⃣ 브런치 (카카오)</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">브런치는 카카오에서 운영하는 플랫폼으로, 감성적인 콘텐츠와 작가 중심의 커뮤니티가 특징이에요. 티스토리와 같은 카카오 계열이지만, 보다 '작품' 지향적인 플랫폼이라고 할 수 있죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>깔끔하고 세련된 디자인으로 콘텐츠 집중도 높음</li>\n<li>작가로서의 브랜딩에 유리한 구조</li>\n<li>추천 시스템을 통한 새로운 독자층 확보 가능</li>\n<li>모바일 최적화가 잘 되어 있음</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>입점 심사가 필요해 진입 장벽이 있음</li>\n<li>광고 수익화가 거의 불가능</li>\n<li>SEO 최적화가 티스토리보다 약함</li>\n<li>콘텐츠 형식에 제한이 많음 (주로 글 중심)</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">브런치는 광고 수익보다는 작가로서의 브랜딩이나 책 출간 등을 목표로 하는 분들에게 더 적합해요. 감성 에세이나 전문 지식을 공유하는 글이 주를 이루죠.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>3️⃣ 워드프레스 (독립형)</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">워드프레스는 전 세계에서 가장 많이 사용되는 CMS(콘텐츠 관리 시스템)로, 완전한 독립 블로그를 운영할 수 있어요. 호스팅과 도메인을 직접 구매해 설치하는 방식입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>완전한 자유도와 소유권</li>\n<li>SEO 최적화에 매우 강력</li>\n<li>다양한 플러그인으로 확장성 무한대</li>\n<li>광고, 아필리에이트, 회원제 등 수익화 방식 다양</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>초기 설정과 관리가 상대적으로 어려움</li>\n<li>호스팅, 도메인 비용 등 유지 비용 발생</li>\n<li>보안, 백업 등을 직접 관리해야 함</li>\n<li>기술적 지식이 어느 정도 필요함</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 티스토리와 병행해서 운영 중인 플랫폼이 바로 워드프레스인데요. 처음엔 설정이 복잡했지만, 익숙해지니 그 자유도가 정말 매력적이에요. 특히 수익화 면에서는 어떤 플랫폼보다 유리합니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>4️⃣ 미디움 (Medium)</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">미디움은 글로벌 콘텐츠 플랫폼으로, 깔끔한 디자인과 강력한 커뮤니티가 특징이에요. 영어 콘텐츠가 주를 이루지만, 한글 콘텐츠도 점점 늘어나고 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>세련된 미니멀 디자인</li>\n<li>글로벌 독자층 접근 가능</li>\n<li>소셜 미디어 공유 및 확산에 유리</li>\n<li>파트너 프로그램을 통한 수익화 가능</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>한글 콘텐츠 검색 노출이 약함</li>\n<li>국내 독자층 확보가 어려움</li>\n<li>유료 구독 모델이 국내 사용자에게 생소함</li>\n<li>번역 기능이 완벽하지 않음</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">영어로 콘텐츠를 작성하거나 글로벌 시장을 겨냥한다면 고려해볼 만하지만, 국내 독자를 대상으로 한다면 다소 제한적입니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>5️⃣ 구글 블로거 (Blogger)</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">구글에서 제공하는 무료 블로그 서비스로, 간단한 설정으로 시작할 수 있어요. 애드센스와의 연동이 쉽고 안정적인 서비스가 특징입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>구글 애드센스 연동이 매우 쉬움</li>\n<li>무료로 사용 가능하며 추가 비용 없음</li>\n<li>구글 검색 최적화에 유리</li>\n<li>안정적인 서버와 속도</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>디자인 템플릿이 제한적</li>\n<li>네이버 검색 노출이 약함</li>\n<li>커스터마이징 옵션이 티스토리보다 적음</li>\n<li>국내 사용자층이 적어 커뮤니티 형성이 어려움</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">구글 블로거는 특히 해외 트래픽을 노리거나 애드센스 수익에 집중하는 블로거에게 적합해요. 하지만 국내 검색 엔진에서의 노출은 상대적으로 약한 편입니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  티스토리 유지 vs 이전: 고민의 기로</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이제 가장 어려운 결정의 시간이네요. 티스토리를 계속 유지할지, 아니면 다른 플랫폼으로 이전할지 비교해봅시다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>티스토리 계속 운영할 경우</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>지금까지 쌓아온 콘텐츠와 SEO 자산을 유지할 수 있어요</li>\n<li>익숙한 관리 환경에서 계속 작업할 수 있어 편리해요</li>\n<li>기존 구독자와 댓글 커뮤니티를 유지할 수 있죠</li>\n<li>애드센스 및 기존 수익 구조를 그대로 이어갈 수 있어요</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>카카오의 정책 변화에 따라 유료화될 가능성이 높아요</li>\n<li>기능 개선이나 업데이트가 느려질 수 있어요</li>\n<li>검색 엔진에서의 노출이 점점 줄어들 위험이 있죠</li>\n<li>플랫폼 자체의 불안정성 위험이 있어요</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><i>다른 플랫폼으로 이전할 경우</i></span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>장점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>새로운 검색 최적화 전략을 구사할 수 있어요</li>\n<li>브랜딩과 수익화 모델을 재설계할 기회가 됩니다</li>\n<li>새로운 UI/UX로 독자들에게 신선한 경험을 제공할 수 있어요</li>\n<li>플랫폼 종속성에서 벗어날 수 있어요 (특히 워드프레스)</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>단점:</b></p>\n<ul style=\"list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li>글, 이미지, 댓글 등의 백업과 이전 작업이 매우 번거로워요</li>\n<li>기존 방문자와 구독자 중 일부는 이탈할 가능성이 높아요</li>\n<li>새로운 플랫폼에 적응하는 데 시간과 노력이 필요해요</li>\n<li>SEO 순위가 처음부터 다시 시작되어 트래픽 감소가 있을 수 있어요</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span

        "contentSnippet": "티스토리를 떠나야 할지 고민하는 요즘, 마음이 참 복잡해요. 블로그 플랫폼이라는 게 한번 정착하면 옮기기가 쉽지 않잖아요. 글, 이미지, 댓글, 그리고 무엇보다 그동안 쌓아온 포스팅들... 다 옮긴다고 생각하면 머리가 지끈지끈 아파옵니다.\n\n\n \n티스토리의 미래가 불안하다는 소식이 들리면서부터 '이제 어디로 가야 하나' 하는 고민이 시작됐어요. 여러분도 비슷한 고민하고 계시죠? 오늘은 제가 여러 블로그 플랫폼을 직접 사용해보고 비교 분석한 내용을 솔직하게 공유해 드릴게요.\n \n  티스토리 이사를 고민해야 할 신호들\n티스토리가 당장 문을 닫진 않겠지만, 몇 가지 불안한 징후들이 나타나고 있어요. 이런 신호들이 보인다면 슬슬 대안을 준비해야 할 때입니다.\n플랫폼 불안정성의 징후\n요즘 티스토리에 로그인하려면 가끔 오류가 뜨더라고요. 글 작성 중에 튕기는 경우도 있고, 이미지 업로드가 예전보다 확실히 느려진 것 같아요. 이런 사소한 문제들이 쌓이다 보면 결국 큰 문제로 이어질 수 있어요.\n더 걱정되는 건, 관리자 측의 공지가 점점 줄어들고 있다는 점이에요. 예전엔 업데이트나 변화에 대해 미리 알려주곤 했는데, 요즘은 갑자기 바뀌어 있는 경우가 많아요. 고객센터 응답도 전보다 느려진 것 같고요.\nSEO 및 트래픽 감소\n제 블로그는 2년 전부터 네이버와 구글 검색 노출이 점점 줄어들고 있어요. 똑같은 콘텐츠 품질인데도 검색 순위가 자꾸 밀리는 느낌이랄까? 특히 네이버는 자사 블로그 우대 정책이 강화되면서 티스토리 블로그의 상위 노출이 점점 어려워지고 있어요.\n이런 검색 노출 감소는 당연히 광고 수익 감소로 이어지죠. 방문자 수가 줄면 애드센스 수익도 감소하니까요. 블로그로 부수입을 올리시는 분들이라면 이 부분이 특히 고민될 거예요.\n유료화 정책 도입 가능성\n솔직히 말해서, 유료화는 피할 수 없는 흐름인 것 같아요. 문제는 그 비용이 얼마나 될지, 그리고 무료 버전에선 어떤 기능이 제한될지예요. 만약 티스토리가 주요 기능을 대부분 유료로 전환한다면, 블로그 수익보다 유지비가 더 나올 수도 있잖아요?\n이 세 가지 중에서 두 가지 이상 해당된다면, 다른 플랫폼으로의 이전을 진지하게 고민해볼 때예요. 당장 무언가를 결정하기보다는, 천천히 대안을 탐색해보는 과정이 필요할 것 같습니다.\n \n \n  티스토리 대체 플랫폼 5곳 비교\n제가 직접 사용해본 5개의 플랫폼을 비교해봤어요. 각각의 특징과 장단점을 솔직하게 분석했습니다.\n1️⃣ 네이버 블로그\n네이버 블로그는 국내 검색 점유율 1위 포털에서 운영하는 만큼, 검색 최적화에 최고의 강점을 가지고 있어요. 특히 네이버 검색에서는 자사 플랫폼 우대 정책이 있어서 검색 유입에 확실히 유리합니다.\n장점:\n네이버 검색 노출이 압도적으로 유리\n대부분의 사용자에게 친숙한 인터페이스\n스마트에디터가 직관적이고 사용하기 쉬움\n네이버 아이디로 쉽게 시작할 수 있음\n단점:\n구글 애드센스 연동이 불가능해 수익화에 제한\n디자인 자유도가 낮고 템플릿이 제한적\n네이버의 정책 변화에 취약함\n타 플랫폼에 비해 전문적인 기능이 부족\n실제로 제 지인 중에는 티스토리에서 네이버로 옮긴 후 트래픽이 3배 이상 증가했다는 분도 있어요. 검색 최적화가 우선이라면 고려해볼 만한 옵션입니다.\n2️⃣ 브런치 (카카오)\n브런치는 카카오에서 운영하는 플랫폼으로, 감성적인 콘텐츠와 작가 중심의 커뮤니티가 특징이에요. 티스토리와 같은 카카오 계열이지만, 보다 '작품' 지향적인 플랫폼이라고 할 수 있죠.\n장점:\n깔끔하고 세련된 디자인으로 콘텐츠 집중도 높음\n작가로서의 브랜딩에 유리한 구조\n추천 시스템을 통한 새로운 독자층 확보 가능\n모바일 최적화가 잘 되어 있음\n단점:\n입점 심사가 필요해 진입 장벽이 있음\n광고 수익화가 거의 불가능\nSEO 최적화가 티스토리보다 약함\n콘텐츠 형식에 제한이 많음 (주로 글 중심)\n브런치는 광고 수익보다는 작가로서의 브랜딩이나 책 출간 등을 목표로 하는 분들에게 더 적합해요. 감성 에세이나 전문 지식을 공유하는 글이 주를 이루죠.\n3️⃣ 워드프레스 (독립형)\n워드프레스는 전 세계에서 가장 많이 사용되는 CMS(콘텐츠 관리 시스템)로, 완전한 독립 블로그를 운영할 수 있어요. 호스팅과 도메인을 직접 구매해 설치하는 방식입니다.\n장점:\n완전한 자유도와 소유권\nSEO 최적화에 매우 강력\n다양한 플러그인으로 확장성 무한대\n광고, 아필리에이트, 회원제 등 수익화 방식 다양\n단점:\n초기 설정과 관리가 상대적으로 어려움\n호스팅, 도메인 비용 등 유지 비용 발생\n보안, 백업 등을 직접 관리해야 함\n기술적 지식이 어느 정도 필요함\n제가 티스토리와 병행해서 운영 중인 플랫폼이 바로 워드프레스인데요. 처음엔 설정이 복잡했지만, 익숙해지니 그 자유도가 정말 매력적이에요. 특히 수익화 면에서는 어떤 플랫폼보다 유리합니다.\n4️⃣ 미디움 (Medium)\n미디움은 글로벌 콘텐츠 플랫폼으로, 깔끔한 디자인과 강력한 커뮤니티가 특징이에요. 영어 콘텐츠가 주를 이루지만, 한글 콘텐츠도 점점 늘어나고 있습니다.\n장점:\n세련된 미니멀 디자인\n글로벌 독자층 접근 가능\n소셜 미디어 공유 및 확산에 유리\n파트너 프로그램을 통한 수익화 가능\n단점:\n한글 콘텐츠 검색 노출이 약함\n국내 독자층 확보가 어려움\n유료 구독 모델이 국내 사용자에게 생소함\n번역 기능이 완벽하지 않음\n영어로 콘텐츠를 작성하거나 글로벌 시장을 겨냥한다면 고려해볼 만하지만, 국내 독자를 대상으로 한다면 다소 제한적입니다.\n5️⃣ 구글 블로거 (Blogger)\n구글에서 제공하는 무료 블로그 서비스로, 간단한 설정으로 시작할 수 있어요. 애드센스와의 연동이 쉽고 안정적인 서비스가 특징입니다.\n장점:\n구글 애드센스 연동이 매우 쉬움\n무료로 사용 가능하며 추가 비용 없음\n구글 검색 최적화에 유리\n안정적인 서버와 속도\n단점:\n디자인 템플릿이 제한적\n네이버 검색 노출이 약함\n커스터마이징 옵션이 티스토리보다 적음\n국내 사용자층이 적어 커뮤니티 형성이 어려움\n구글 블로거는 특히 해외 트래픽을 노리거나 애드센스 수익에 집중하는 블로거에게 적합해요. 하지만 국내 검색 엔진에서의 노출은 상대적으로 약한 편입니다.\n \n \n  티스토리 유지 vs 이전: 고민의 기로\n이제 가장 어려운 결정의 시간이네요. 티스토리를 계속 유지할지, 아니면 다른 플랫폼으로 이전할지 비교해봅시다.\n티스토리 계속 운영할 경우\n장점:\n지금까지 쌓아온 콘텐츠와 SEO 자산을 유지할 수 있어요\n익숙한 관리 환경에서 계속 작업할 수 있어 편리해요\n기존 구독자와 댓글 커뮤니티를 유지할 수 있죠\n애드센스 및 기존 수익 구조를 그대로 이어갈 수 있어요\n단점:\n카카오의 정책 변화에 따라 유료화될 가능성이 높아요\n기능 개선이나 업데이트가 느려질 수 있어요\n검색 엔진에서의 노출이 점점 줄어들 위험이 있죠\n플랫폼 자체의 불안정성 위험이 있어요\n다른 플랫폼으로 이전할 경우\n장점:\n새로운 검색 최적화 전략을 구사할 수 있어요\n브랜딩과 수익화 모델을 재설계할 기회가 됩니다\n새로운 UI/UX로 독자들에게 신선한 경험을 제공할 수 있어요\n플랫폼 종속성에서 벗어날 수 있어요 (특히 워드프레스)\n단점:\n글, 이미지, 댓글 등의 백업과 이전 작업이 매우 번거로워요\n기존 방문자와 구독자 중 일부는 이탈할 가능성이 높아요\n새로운 플랫폼에 적응하는 데 시간과 노력이 필요해요\nSEO 순위가 처음부터 다시 시작되어 트래픽 감소가 있을 수 있어요\n \n  블로거 유형별 추천 플랫폼\n모든 블로거에게 딱 맞는 하나의 플랫폼은 없어요. 각자의 운영 목적과 스타일에 따라 다른 선택이 필요합니다.\n블로거 유형 추천 플랫폼 추천 이유\n블로거 유형\n추천 플랫폼\n추천 이유\n\n\n\n\n수익형 블로그 운영자\n워드프레스, 구글 블로거\n광고 배치 자유도가 높고, 애드센스 최적화가 용이함\n\n\n감성 콘텐츠 작가\n브런치\n깔끔한 UI로 글 자체에 집중할 수 있고, 감성 콘텐츠에 최적화됨\n\n\n검색 유입이 중요한 블로거\n네이버 블로그\n국내 최대 포털에서의 검색 노출이 압도적으로 유리함\n\n\n글로벌 대상 콘텐츠 제작자\n미디움\n영어 기반 콘텐츠의 확산력이 우수하고 국제적 독자층 접근 가능\n\n\n커뮤니티 중심 블로거\n네이버 블로그, 티스토리\n댓글과 소통 기능이 활성화되어 있고, 국내 사용자에게 친숙함\n\n\n\n \n✅ 결론: 당장의 결정보다 중요한 것\n솔직히 말해서, 저는 티스토리를 10년 가까이 운영해왔지만 최근에는 워드프레스도 병행하고 있어요. 왜냐하면 플랫폼 하나에만 의존하는 것이 얼마나 위험한지 깨달았기 때문이에요.\n \n지금 고민하고 계신다면, 단순히 불안하다는 감정만으로 서둘러 결정하기보다는 \"내 블로그 운영 목적과 전략에 따라 이사 여부를 판단하는 것\"이 중요합니다.\n \n그리고 무엇보다 중요한 건, 백업은 지금 당장 하셔야 합니다! 어떤 결정을 내리든, 소중한 콘텐츠는 반드시 안전하게 보관해두세요. 또한 대체 플랫폼을 미리 테스트해보는 것도 현명한 전략입니다. 소규모로 새 플랫폼을 시작해 경험을 쌓아보세요.\n결국 플랫폼은 도구일 뿐이고, 가장 중요한 건 콘텐츠의 가치라는 점을 잊지 마세요. 어디서 글을 쓰든, 여러분의 진정성과 전문성이 담긴 콘텐츠는 언제나 가치가 있을 거예요.\n여러분은 어떤 플랫폼으로 옮길 생각이 있으신가요? 아니면 티스토리를 계속 지킬 준비가 되어 있으신가요? 댓글로 여러분의 고민과 선택을 나눠주세요!  ‍♂️ ‍♀️\n \n \n\n \n다음(Daum)의 굴곡진 역사, 포털 제왕에서 카카오의 손을 떠나기까지\n한때 대한민국을 대표했던 포털, 다음(Daum). 한메일과 카페로 인터넷 문화를 선도했지만, 네이버와 구글의 부상, 모바일 전환 실패로 쇠퇴의 길을 걸었습니다. 결국 카카오에 인수된 다음은 이제\nmuzbox.tistory.com\n\n\n \n카카오, 다음과 결별하다! 티스토리의 앞날은?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "*악플을 쓰시려면, 기분이 태도가 되지 않게 특히 주의 바랍니다. 내가 쓴 악플은 세상 누구도 안 읽을 수도 있지만, 쓰시는 분은 반드시 읽습니다. 이 악플은 남을 향하기 전에 자기 자신에게 먼저 향합니다.\n2월에 ‘더 열심히 일하지 않으면’이라는 글을 썼다. 솔직히 나는 그냥 내가 평소에 하던 생각을 그냥 포스팅했는데, 시장에서 꽤 많은 반응이 있었다. 한 달 만에 댓글이 약 250개 넘게 달렸는데, 주말에 전부 다 읽었다. 좋은 내용도 있지만, 공간 낭비하는 내용도 많아서, 좋은 내용 중 내가 바로 답변 할 수 있는 건 답변을 했고, 생각이 조금 더 필요한 건 나중에 답변하고 싶은데, 그동안 댓글이 너무 많이 달려서, 언제 다 답변할지 고민 중이다. 어떤 분이 답변하기 곤란한 댓글은 내가 무시한다고 했는데(“지 대답하기 곤란한 건 댓글 안 남기네 ㅋ”), 그건 아니고, 이 댓글처럼 답변할 가치가 없는 댓글은 댓글 안 남기는 게 맞지만, 댓글 중 대답하기에 곤란하지만, 좋은 내용도 많다. 이 댓글들은 조금 더 생각을 정리해서 답변을 언젠간 남길 계획이다.\n다른 분들의 댓글을 보면 일단 항상 같은 생각을 하는데, 세상엔 정말 다양한 생각을 가진 분들이 다양한 스타일로 존재한다는 생각이다. 나도 이 사업을 하면서, 최대한 머리와 가슴을 활짝 열고 그 어떤 것도 내 생각과 기준으로 판단하지 않으려고 노력을 많이 하지만, 많은 분들이 달아준 코멘트를 읽으면서 아직도 나는 내 생각이 꽤 강하다는 걸 느꼈는데, 그렇다고 이걸 또 크게 반성하진 않았다. 사람들은 참으로 다양한 의견과 믿음이 있지만, 내 기준으로 봤을 때 상식을 크게 밑도는 의견을 주신 분들도 많았다. 그분들은 내 생각이 틀리고, 본인들의 생각이 맞는다고 주장하겠지만, 나 또한 그분들의 의견들보단 내 생각이 상식에 더 가깝다고 생각하기 때문이다.\n가장 많은 근거 없고 감정적인 비난을 받기도 했지만, 또 반대로, 좋은 자료와 데이터를 기반으로 가장 논리적이고 생산적으로 비판한 내용을 요약하자면, 한국도 미국같이 제대로 된 보상을 해주면 직원들이 더 열심히 하지 않을 이유가 없다는 내용이다. 이 중, 제대로 된 보상을 해주면 본인들도 더 열심히 일하겠다는 댓글을 남겨주신 분들도 있다.\n일차원적으로 생각해 보면 당연히 맞는 말이다. 자본주의에서 우린 돈을 받고 그만큼 우리의 시간을 남에게 빌려주는 거라서, 받는 만큼 일하는 건 당연하다. 하지만, 이런 의견을 감정적으로, 그리고 익명으로 남긴 분들 중 몇 명이나 본인 연봉의 절반 값이라도 할지 매우 궁금하기도 하다. 본인들은 열심히 일하는데 회사에서 그만큼 대우를 안 해준다고 생각할 텐데, 오히려 회사에서는 이런 분들에게 지금 주는 월급도 아깝다고 생각할 수도 있을 것 같다는 생각을 떨쳐버릴 수가 없다. 닭이 먼저냐, 달걀이 먼저냐 하는, 아주 오래된 논쟁이긴 한데, 정말 일을 잘하고 능력 있는 분들인데 회사에서 그만큼 보상을 못 받는다고 느낀다면 더 많이 받을 수 있는 다른 직장으로 옮기면 된다. 왜 현재 직장에서는 이분의 능력만큼 대우를 안 해줄까? 여러 가지 사정이 있겠지만, 어쩌면 그 회사에서는 이분의 능력을 인정하지 않을 수도 있다. 즉, 능력도 없고 일도 잘 못 하는 사람이라는 뜻이다. 아마도 그렇기 때문에 본인은 더 높은 연봉을 받아야 하는데 회사에서는 이를 인정하지 않으니, 그냥 받는 만큼만 일한다고 생각하는 것 같다. 그렇다고 더 대우가 좋은 곳으로 이직할 능력은 없으니 그냥 계속 그러고 있는 것이다. 이런 사람들만 회사에 있다면, 그 회사는 발전할 수가 없고, 제발 우리가 투자한 회사의 직원 중 이런 분들은 한 명도 없길 바란다.\n실리콘밸리 회사들같이 억대 연봉을 주고, 스톡옵션을 주면, 본인들도 한국에서 개 같이 일 할 수 있다는 의견도 많았다. 음,,,이 의견들도 나는 동의하기가 어렵긴 했다. 실리콘밸리 지역에서 5억 원 연봉을 받는다고 해보자. 절반 세금 내면, 세후 월급이 2,100만 원 정도인데, 가족이 있다면, 그리고 월세를 내고 있다면, 1,000만 원 이상이 월세로 나갈 수 있다. 애들이 있다면 엄마, 아빠가 각각 차가 있어야 하는데, 자동차 할부값 내고, 생활비 내고 하면, 솔직히 거의 저축을 못 할 수도 있다. 이 동네 물가가 얼마나 살인적인지 아는 분들은 내가 하는 말을 어느 정도는 이해할 것이다. 이렇게 따지고 보면, 실리콘밸리의 높은 연봉이 그렇게 높은 건 아니고, 돈을 많이 받기 때문에 이 동네 스타트업 사람들이 열심히 일하는 것만은 아니다.\n어떤 분들은 한국 회사는 스톡옵션도 안 주고, 회사 잘 되면 대표만 부자가 된다고 했는데, 그건 그 회사의 문제지 한국의 문제는 아니라고 생각한다. 그런 회사에 다니면 그냥 스톡옵션 주는 회사로 옮기면 된다. 아니면, 본인이 일을 못 해서 주식 보상을 못 받는 건 아닌지 고민해 봐도 좋을 것 같다.\n이런 부류의 댓글에 대해서는,\n“너 같은 인간들이 있으니까 벤처 캐피탈 운운하는 인간들이 흡혈귀 취급을 받지.”\n“VC는 이렇게 생각하는구나 생각이 남다르시네요”\n“글 쓴 분은 벤처캐피탈 대표니까 이런 발상이 되죠 ㅋㅋ”\n이 글은 내가 쓴 것이지 VC들의 생각을 대변하는 건 아니라는 점을 다시 한번 강조하고 싶다.\n그리고, 혹시나 나는 주 3일 근무하고, 주중에 골프 치고, 밤에 술 먹고, 일도 안 하면서, 투자한 회사 대표들 족치면서 개 같이 일하라고 닦달한다고 생각한다면, 그건 완벽한 오산이다. 내가 장담하건대, 나는 우리가 투자한 회사의 창업가분들만큼 열심히 일한다.\n마지막으로, 내가 제일 짜증이 났던 이런 댓글이 있었다.\n“좀 다른 이야기지만 총,균,쇠 라는 책이 생각납니다.\n정복하는 문명과 정복당하는 문명의 차이는 사람들이 근면하고 게으르고의 차이가 아니라 환경의 차이였다.. 라는 내용이 주제입니다.\n사실 한국은 이미 망했습니다.\n이미 망했으나 아직 망함이 눈앞에 다가오지 않았을 뿐입니다.\n지금 와서 좀 더 열심히 일해 봤자 돌이킬 수 있는 수준이 아닙니다.\n너무 열심히 일하다 보니 애 낳을 시간도 없었던 거 같네요.”\n그 환경은 그럼 누가 만들까? 그냥 처음부터 환경이라는 게 만들어져 있었을까? 우리 개개인이 이 환경을 만드는 것인데, 지금 한국은 더 열심히 일하지 않으면 이전 세대가 만들어 놓은 정복하는 문명이 정복당하는 문명이 될 위기에 처해 있기 때문에 걱정이 된다. 그리고 이분이 어떤 분인지 참 궁금하다. 그리고 왜 그럼 아직 한국에 살고 있는지도 물어보고 싶다. 돈이 없거나, 온갖 핑계를 대면서 외국에 못 나간다고 하겠지. 그럼 더 열심히 해서 한국을 더 좋은 곳으로 만들고 싶진 않을까? \n잘 사는 나라가 더 잘 살기 위해선, 국민들이 더 열심히 일해야 한다. 한국도 이젠 잘 사는 나라의 대열에 끼기 시작했는데, 모두 더 열심히 일해야 한다. 특히 스타트업은.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 공간을 통해서도 과거에 몇 번 글을 쓴 적이 있는데, 내가 2012년에 스트롱을 시작하고 첫 2년 동안 투자자로서 가장 스트레스를 많이 받았던 건, 우리가 투자한 회사의 창업가보다 내가 그 사업에 대해서 더 많이 알고, 내가 그 사업을 하면 더 잘할 수 있을 것 같은데, 대표가 항상 내 생각과 말과 다르게 생각하고 행동할 때였다. 아마도 이걸 보면 공감하는 투자자들이 꽤 있을 것이다.\n예를 들면, B2C를 해야 하는데 B2B를 하고 있거나, 아주 좁고 깊게 시장을 공략해야 하는데 넓고 얕게 공략하거나, 싸게 많이 팔아야 하는데 비싸게 적게 팔고 있거나, 뭐, 이런 것부터, 제품을 만드는 방법, 펀딩 전략, 채용 전략 등과 같은 중, 장기적인 회사의 방향에 대해서 하나부터 열까지 내가 동의하지 못하는 경우가 지금도 많지만, VC 초창기 시절에는 투자하는 회사마다 이런 갈등이 있었다. 지금 생각해 보면, 그땐 나는 VC가 아니라 VC 흉내를 내는 거였는데, 하루 종일 일하고 집에 와서 침대에 누우면, 엄청난 고민과 스트레스 때문에 잠을 설쳤는데, “왜 저분은 사업을 저렇게 할까? 내가 하면 훨씬 더 잘할 수 있을 것 같은데 왜 내 말을 안 들을까?”와 같은 생각을 하면서 참 괴로웠다.\n그런데, 더 많은 회사에 투자하고, 훨씬 더 많은 창업가들을 만나면서 이 부분에 대한 생각이 완전히 바뀌었다. 그리고 다행히도, 점점 더 시간이 지나면서 내가 VC 초창기에 스트레스받았던 이런 고민이 쓸데없고, 시간이 지나면서 내가 완전히 틀렸다는 게 점점 더 증명되고 있어서 다행이다.\n시간이 지나면서 우리가 과거에 투자한 회사들의 실적과 결과가 조금씩 명확해지고 있는데, 잘되고 있는 회사들은 실은 내가 주장했던 이 회사들이 가야 하는 방향과 취해야 하는 전략과는 완전히 다른 방법으로 사업을 하는 회사들이 훨씬 더 많다. 즉, 내가 창업가들에게 “사업은 이렇게 해야 한다.”라고 훈수했던 내용과 완전히 다른, 창업가들이 주장한 방식으로 사업한 회사들이 잘 되고 있다. 내가 주장했던 방식으로 사업을 했다면, 아마도 망했을 것이다. 이와 반대로, 내가 너무 세게 주장해서, 내 말을 듣고 본인의 의지와는 다르게 사업했던 창업가들은 지금은 회사가 망했거나 잘 못 하고 있다. 나 때문에 사업이 잘 안됐다고 할 것까진 아니지만, 그래도 이분들이 내 말은 무시하고, 본인이 생각하는 대로만 사업을 했다면, 어쩌면 더 잘 할텐데라는 생각을 요새 가끔 한다.\n내가 맞을 확률보단, 틀릴 확률이 훨씬 높다는 걸 직접 몸으로 체험하면서 요새 나는 내가 창업가들보다 사업을 더 잘 한다는 틀린 믿음으로 인한 고민을 잘 안 하고, 스트레스도 거의 안 받는다. 이건 생각해 보면 너무 당연한 건데, 나는 VC 초반에는 정말 아마추어 같은 생각을 했던 것 같다. 나 같이 수백 개 회사에 투자해서 한 회사에 대해 진지하게 고민하고 생각하는 시간이 짧고 얕은 초기 VC가 어떻게 1년 365일, 하루 24시간 한가지 사업과 제품에 대해서만 고민하는 창업가보다 그 사업을 더 잘 알거나, 잘할 수가 있겠는가? 솔직히 과거에 내가 몇몇 대표님들에게 “나 같으면 그렇게 안 할 것 같은데요” , “그 사업은 이렇게 해야죠” 등의 발언을 했던 걸 생각해 보면 얼굴이 약간 화끈거린다.\n그래서 어느 순간부터 나는 선을 명확하게 긋기 시작했다. 나는 사업을 운영하는 사람이 아니라 그 사업을 운영하는 믿을만한 창업가들에게 투자하고 이들을 응원하는 사람이라는 선을. 흑백논리로 따져보면 이건 네 사업이지, 내 사업이 아니라는 사고다. 그리고 이렇게 선을 명확하게 그으니까 긍정적인 일들이 생기고 있다. 일단, 내 스트레스 관리 차원에서 너무 좋다. 투자한 회사 대표가 사업을 잘 못 해도, 내가 할 수 있는 건 많이 없다고 명확하게 구분하니까 스트레스를 잘 안 받는다. 그리고, 내가 창업가들보다 사업을 못하는 게 명백하기 때문에, 내가 하는 이야기를 그들이 듣지 않아도 스트레스가 없다. 이런 생각으로 창업가들을 대하다 보니, 서로 웃는 얼굴로 할 말을 편안하게 할 수 있고, professional 한 관계가 오래 유지되는 걸 요새 직접 경험하고 있다.\n주주총회나 이사회에 가보면, 아직도 내가 투자한 회사의 대표보다 내가 사업을 더 잘할 수 있고, 시장을 더 잘 알고, 제품을 더 잘 만들 수 있다고 생각하는 VC가 있는데, 이들에게 같은 조언을 드리고 싶다. 투자자와 창업가 사이에는 명확한 선이 있고, 그 선을 되도록 넘지 않길 바란다. 왜냐하면, VC가 창업가보다 사업을 더 잘 알고, 잘할 수 있다는 생각은 100% 착각이기 때문이다.",

According to Toss Walk, participants collectively walked a total of 276,519 steps and collected trash that filled 30 biodegradable 18L bags.\nThis plogging event, Toss Peace’s first local environmental cleanup activity, was organized to reflect on the value of forests and raise awareness about the importance of environmental protection in honor of the International Day of Forests. After the activity, participants shared their thoughts, saying, “I realized that even small efforts can contribute to protecting nature,” and “I’m determined to develop habits that reduce waste and prioritize environmental care.” A Toss representative said, “Moving forward, Toss Peace will continue to engage in various activities beyond environmental protection efforts.”\nToss Peace is an in-house volunteer group composed of Toss employees who participate voluntarily. The name ‘Toss Peace’ combines the brand name ‘Toss’ with ‘Peace.’ Since its establishment in June 2023, Toss Peace has actively volunteered at ‘Purme Social Farm,’ under the Purme Foundation, and ‘Hansarang Village,’ a facility for individuals with severe disabilities.",

심지어 같은 월급을 받더라도 이런 차이가 생기기도 하죠. 이는 미리 낸 세금과 실제 부담해야 할 세금이 다르기 때문이에요.\n언뜻 들으면 이게 무슨 말인가 싶지만, 나라에서 세금을 어떻게 걷어가는지 조금만 이해하면 세금 환급 구조를 쉽게 이해할 수 있어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}우리는 세금을\n미리 내고 있어요\n우리나라는 납세의 의무가 있어 소득이 있는 대한민국 국민이라면 누구나 세금을 내야 합니다. 하지만 전국에서 동시다발적으로 발생하는 세금을 실시간으로 정확하게 계산하기란 현실적으로 어려운 일이겠죠. \n그래서 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}국세청은 효율적으로 세금을 걷기 위해 원천징수라는 방식을 사용합니다. 원천징수란 소득을 지급하는 쪽에서 소득세, 보험료 등을 포함해 일정 금액을 미리 떼고 세금으로 대신 납부하는 제도예요. 근로자의 세전·세후 월급의 차이가 큰 이유, 프리랜서가 돈을 받을 때 3.3%를 떼고 받는 이유가 바로 이 때문입니다.\n다만, 원천징수는 편의상 추정해 낸 세금이기 때문에 연말정산이나 종합소득세 신고를 통해 납세자가 1년 동안 실제로 부담했어야 할 세금을 정확히 산정하게 됩니다. 이렇게 최종적으로 결정된 세금을 결정세액이라고 하고, 1년간 원천징수로 미리 냈던 세금은 기납부세액이라고 불러요. 이 둘을 비교해 기납부세액이 더 크다면 환급을 받고, 반대로 적다면 세금을 추가로 납부해야 합니다. \n연말정산과 종합소득세 신고는 미리 낸 세금과 실제 부담해야 할 세금을 비교하고 조정하는 과정인 셈이에요.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n내야 할 세금은\n이렇게 매겨져요\n소득금액, 과세표준, 산출세액, 결정세액. 이 네 가지만 알면 세금이 산출되는 구조를 쉽게 이해할 수 있어요.\n사람들은 돈을 버는 과정에서 일하는 데 꼭 필요한 비용을 쓰기도 하고, 매달 기본적인 생활비도 부담하며 살아가요. 그래서 나라에서는 일정 금액을 어느 정도 소득에서 빼주는데, 이를 소득공제라고 해요. 소득금액에서 소득공제를 적용한 금액을 과세표준이라고 합니다. 말 그대로 세금이 부과되는 기준이죠. 그리고 과세표준에 소득세율을 곱하면 산출세액이 정해져요.\n산출세액을 계산한 후에는 세액공제를 적용해 일정 금액을 차감합니다. 세액공제는 특정한 소비나 투자를 유도하기 위해 세금 자체를 줄여주는 제도예요. 세액공제까지 반영되면 내야 할 세금이 정해지는데, 이게 바로 결정세액이에요.\n한 문장으로 정리해볼게요. 소득공제로 과세표준을 정한 뒤 산출세액을 계산하고, 세액공제를 적용하면 납세자가 최종적으로 부담할 결정세액이 산출된다. 단계별로 차근차근 살펴보니 복잡하지 않죠?\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}과세표준이

중요해요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0

많다고\n꼭 좋은 걸까요?\n세금 환급을 많이 받으면 보너스를 받은 것 처럼 기분은 좋지만, 사실 환급금이 많은 게 꼭 좋은 것만은 아닙니다. 세금을 돌려받았다는 건 그만큼 내가 실제로 내야 할 세금보다 더 냈었다는 뜻이니까요. \n결국, 세금을 많이 낸 뒤 돌려받든, 적게 내고 추가로 납부하든 결과적으로는 같은 돈을 내는 셈이죠. 오히려 처음부터 세금을 덜 냈다면, 그 돈을 투자금으로 활용하거나 예·적금에 넣어 이자를 받을 수도 있었을 겁니다.\n그럼에도 불구하고\n내가 놓친 환급금\n세금 신고 기간이 지나면 작년 세금에 대해서는 다 끝났다고 생각하기 쉬워요. 하지만 그동안 미처 챙기지 못한 세금 환급액이 남아 있을 수도 있습니다. 전문가가 아닌 이상 공제 혜택을 매번 완벽하게 챙기기는 쉽지 않으니까요. 혹시 내가 더 돌려받을 수 있었던 세금을 놓친 건 아닐까 걱정된다면, 토스에서 확인해 보세요.\n토스 앱에서는 지난 5년간 납부한 세금 중 돌려받을 수 있는 금액이 있는지, 있다면 얼마나 받을 수 있는지 쉽게 확인할 수 있어요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현",

The service, first introduced on January 19 last year, has been improved to be more intuitive and convenient.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n‘Compare Car Loans’ allows users to easily compare and receive recommendations for car insurance products directly within the Toss app. Financial consumers seeking to purchase or renew their car insurance can quickly check premiums and proceed with the application process without complicated steps.\nThe most notable improvement in this update is that users can now view premiums identical to those provided by insurance companies. Car insurance is mandatory in Korea, and renewal notifications are typically sent 30 days before the policy expiration date. Toss now aligns with this timeline, enabling users to check their renewal premiums from the same point onward. For example, policyholders whose car insurance expires on April 19 can now view identical premium amounts as shown on insurer platforms.\nPreviously, consumers had to manually enter details such as their car model, insurance start date, and estimated driving distance. With the improved service, users can now simply input their name and resident registration number to automatically retrieve their vehicle model, insurance expiry date, and other relevant information.\nAdditionally, Toss has introduced a streamlined system to identify eligible discounts based on data such as number of steps walked or public transportation usage. This automated data integration eliminates the need for users to manually input information, ensuring they receive accurate final premium estimates. This improvement addresses the previous inconvenience of having to manually enter this data on insurance company websites, which often resulted in missed benefits.\nToss’s partnered insurers include 10 companies: Samsung Fire & Marine Direct Insurance, DB Insurance, Hyundai Marine & Fire Direct Insurance, KB Insurance, Meritz Fire & Marine Insurance, Carrot General Insurance, AXA Direct Insurance, Hana Insurance, Heungkuk Fire & Marine Insurance, Lotte Insurance (available from April 1).\nThis service can be accessed through the Toss app by navigating to the ‘All’ tab > ‘Compare Car Loans’ or by searching ‘Compare Car Loans’ in the search (magnifier) feature.\nA Toss representative said, “We have improved the service to help users compare and choose car insurance more easily and accurately,” adding, “We will continue to innovate automotive financial services to maximize user convenience.”",
