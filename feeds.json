This blog is also complemented by the recent Pure Virtual C++ pre-conference talk by RanDair Porter; so please check out RanDair’s talk, “MSVC C++23 Conformance”, if you have not already to get a better view of MSVC’s conformance status for Visual Studio 2022 overall.\n17.13 notes for reference.\nC++23 Features\nNote: C++23 features can be used by either adding /std:c++latest or\n/std:c++23preview to the command line. In addition, features used from unfinished standards may not\nhave full IntelliSense support.\nAdd support for P1102R2\n(Down with ()!) which makes a parameter-list an optional part of a lambda-declarator.\nauto lambda = [] constexpr { }; // C++23: can now omit the '()' after the capture list.\nImplemented P1938R3:\nif consteval for C++23.\nconstexpr int f(int) {\r\n  if consteval { // C++23: previously this would be 'if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) { ... }'.\r\n    return 42;\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    return 1337;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\nint main(int argc, const char**) {\r\n  static_assert(f(0) == 42);\r\n  int x = f(argc);\r\n  if (x != 1337) // Since 'f' cannot be evaluated at compile-time, the value here is '1337'\r\n                 // due to taking the 'else' branch in 'f'.\r\n    return 1;\r\n}\nImplement P1401R5 –\nNarrowing contextual conversions to bool, making the following well-formed as of C++23:\nenum Flags { Zero, One, Two };\r\nstatic_assert(One | Two);\nAdd support of P2173R1 –\nattributes for lambda-expressions.\nauto lambda = [] [[nodiscard]] [[deprecated]] { return 10; };\r\nvoid f() {\r\n  lambda(); // C++23: Attributes here will fire a deprecation warning and a discard of return value warning.\r\n}\nImplement P1169R4 which adds\nsupport for static operator().\nImplement P2589R1 which adds\nsupport for static operator[].\nstruct Functor {\r\n  static constexpr int operator()() { return 42; }\r\n  static constexpr int operator[](int) { return 42; }\r\n};\r\nusing T1 = decltype(Functor::operator()());  // C++23: Deduces to 'int'.\r\nstatic_assert(Functor::operator()() == 42); // C++23: Can be used without creating a 'Functor' object.\r\n\r\nusing T2 = decltype(Functor::operator[](10));  // C++23: Deduces to 'int'.\r\nstatic_assert(Functor::operator[](10) == 42); // C++23: Can be used without creating a 'Functor' object.\nSmaller C++23 Items\nImplement CWG2428 – Deprecating a concept.\nCompiler

for non-static data members of classes\nimported from metadata\nMSVC\nrejects valid pack expansion of lambda expressions \nFix regression in C++/CLI which causes a crash or bad diagnostics when calling functions with parameter-arrays\nand compiling for Net Core.\nError\nwith String::Format in C++ CLR Class Library (.NET) project\nCompilation\nError Occurs When Using std::shared_ptr in C++/CLI Code\nDiagnostics\nAdd a warning to detect undefined behavior mentioned in [meta.reqmts].\n\nC++\nstd::is_signed_v is implemented wrong.\nFixes the lack of a diagnostic on an initialization

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2025.04.09 registry release, 2025-03-22, 2025-04-01, and 2025-04-07 tool releases, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout April. This release contains bug fixes, a new documentation article on offline usage of vcpkg, and other minor improvements. Arm64 Linux users of vcpkg also no longer have to build the vcpkg tool from source when they install vcpkg.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,587 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n23 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n234 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n92 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,800 forks and 24,600 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.04.09 release)\nThe following notable changes were made in April:\nArm64 Linux users of vcpkg now receive a prebuilt binary when they bootstrap, rather than having to wait for a source build (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1599).\nImproved vcpkg output to clearly state relative paths to files that are being downloaded (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1618).\nFixed a crash on Windows when curl is used to download assets (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1639, thanks @autoantwort!).\nFixed some bugs with SPDX files generated by vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1607, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nFixed some bugs with how vcpkg interacts with curl (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1440, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1598, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1630, thanks @moritz-h, @AndreyAlifanov, and @Osyotr!).\nOther bug fixes (thanks @autoantwort!).\nDocumentation changes\nNew concepts article: Offline Usage of vcpkg. Details two methods on how to deploy vcpkg in environments without live Internet connectivity (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#457).\nAdded entry for VCPKG_LOCK_FIND_PACKAGE_<Pkg> to vcpkg in CMake projects concepts article. When this option is set, non-nested calls to CMake’s find_package can be required or disabled (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#344).\nAdded entry for MAYBE_UNUSED_VARIABLES to the Maintainer guide.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Meta and Quantsight have improved key libraries in the Python Ecosystem. There is plenty more to do and we invite the community to help with our efforts. \nWe’ll look at two key efforts in Python’s packaging ecosystem to make packages faster and easier to use:\n Unlock performance wins for developers through free-threaded Python – where we leverage Python 3.13’s support for concurrent programming (made possible by removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)). \n Increase developer velocity in the IDE with improved type annotations.\nEnhancing typed Python in the Python scientific stack\nType hints, introduced in Python 3.5 with PEP-484, allow developers to specify variable types, enhancing code understanding without affecting runtime behavior. Type-checkers validate these annotations, helping prevent bugs and improving IDE functions like autocomplete and jump-to-definition. Despite their benefits, adoption is inconsistent across the open source ecosystem, with varied approaches to specifying and maintaining type annotations.\nThe landscape of open source software is fractured with respect to how type annotations are specified, maintained, and distributed to end users. Some projects have in-line annotations (types directly declared in the source code directly), others keep types in stub files, and many projects have no types at all, relying on third party repositories such as the typeshed to provide community-maintained stubs. Each approach has its own pros and cons, but application and maintenance of them has been inconsistent.\nMeta and Quansight are addressing this inconsistency through:\nDirect contributions: We have improved the type coverage for pandas-stubs and numpy, and are eager to expand the effort to more packages. \nCommunity engagement: Promoting type annotation efforts to encourage community involvement, listen to feedback and create actionable ways to improve the ecosystem. \nTooling and automation: Developing tools to address common challenges adding types and keeping the types up-to-date with the source code.\nImproved type annotations in pandas\nTL;DR: Pandas is the second most downloaded package from the Python scientific stack. We improved pandas-stubs package type annotation coverage from 36% to over 50%.\nBackground\nThe pandas community maintains its own stubs in a separate repository, which must be installed to obtain type annotations. While these stubs are checked separately from the source code, it allows the community to use types with their own type checking and IDE. \nImproving type coverage\nWhen we began our work in pandas-stubs, coverage was around 36%, as measured by the percentage of parameters, returns, and attributes that had a complete type annotation (the annotation is present and all generics have type arguments). After several weeks of work and about 30 PRs, type completeness is now measured at over 50%. The majority of our contributions involved adding annotations to previously-untyped parameters, adding type arguments to raw generic types, and removing deprecated/undocumented interfaces. We also improved several inaccurate annotations and updated others to match the inline annotations in the pandas source code. \nKey introductions\nTwo key introductions significantly increased coverage:\nReplacing raw Series types with UnknownSeries, a new type aliased to Series[Any]. When applied to return type annotations, this reduces the number of type checker false-positives when the function is called.\nImproving types of core Dataframe operations like insert, combine, replace, transpose, and assign, as well as many timestamp and time-zone related APIs.\nTooling development\nIn addition to improving coverage directly, we developed tooling to catalog public interfaces missing annotations. We also augmented our tools for measuring type coverage to handle the situation where stubs are distributed independently, rather than being packaged into the core library wheel.\nWhat is free-threaded Python ?\nFree-threaded Python (FTP) is an experimental build of CPython that allows multiple threads to interact with the VM in parallel. Previously, access to the VM required holding the global interpreter lock (GIL), thereby serializing execution of concurrently running threads. With the GIL becoming optional, developers will be able to take full advantage of multi-core processors and write truly parallel code.\nBenefits of free-threaded Python\nThe benefits of free-threaded Python are numerous:\nTrue parallelism in a single process: With the GIL removed, developers can write Python code that takes full advantage of multi-core processors without needing to use multiple processes. CPU-bound code can execute in parallel across multiple cores.\nImproved performance: By allowing multiple threads to execute Python code simultaneously, work can be effectively distributed across multiple threads inside a single process.\nSimplified concurrency: Free-threading provides developers with a more ergonomic way to write parallel programs in Python. Gone are the days of needing to use multiprocessing.Pool and/or resorting to custom shared memory data structures to efficiently share data between worker processes.\nGetting Python’s ecosystem ready for FTP\nThe ecosystem of Python packages must work well with free-threaded Python in order for it to be practically useful; application owners can’t use free-threading unless their dependencies work well with it. To that end, we have been taking a “bottoms up” approach to tackle the most difficult/popular packages in the ecosystem. We’ve added free-threading support to many of the most popular packages used for scientific computing (e.g. numpy, scipy, scikit-learn) and language bindings (e.g. Cython, nanobind, pybind, PyO3).\nJust getting started\nTogether, we made substantial progress in improving type annotations and free-threading compatibility in Python libraries. We couldn’t have done it without the Python community and are asking others to join our efforts.  Whether it’s further updates to the type annotations or preparing your code for FTP, we value your help moving the Python ecosystem forward!\nTo learn more about Meta Open Source, visit our open source site, subscribe to our YouTube channel, or follow us on Facebook, Threads, X and LinkedIn.\nThe post Enhancing the Python ecosystem with type checking and free threading appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

C++ makes it harder, but when you do, it blows away your whole leg.” — Bjarne Stroustrup\nWe can’t make С and C++ simpler, but we can make working with them a bit easier. CLion is now free for non-commercial use!\nYes, finally.\nWhether you’re a student, an Arduino experimenter, or someone who loves С and C++ with all your heart despite all the challenges these languages present, CLion is now available to you for free – as long as you’re not using it for commercial work.\nWhat’s happening?\nLast year we implemented a new licensing model for RustRover, Rider, and WebStorm, making them free for non-commercial use. We’re now extending this model to CLion. If you’re using it for non-commercial purposes, such as learning, open-source project development, content creation, or hobby development, you can now do so for free. For commercial use, our existing licensing model still applies.\nNote that while CLion now joins RustRover, Rider, and WebStorm in being free for non-commercial use, this update doesn’t apply to other JetBrains IDEs at this time. We’re keeping an eye on how things go and will continue evaluating the impact of this initiative.\nWhy are we doing this?\nIn making non-commercial development free, we aim to make JetBrains IDEs more accessible to a broader audience. We hope the new licensing model will further lower the barrier to using our IDEs, helping you learn, grow, and stay creative.\nYou can find more details about why we’re introducing this update in the blog post making the original announcement.\nWhy CLion?\nC++ is powerful, but it’s not exactly known for being easy or forgiving. And then there’s C – lean, low-level, and still a core part of many computer science curricula. Whether you’re learning these languages, diving into systems programming, or exploring embedded development on your own, C and C++ often come with a steep learning curve.\nWe want to support that journey. With CLion now free for non-commercial use, it’s easier for you to experiment, learn, and build – without worrying about the IDE license.\nCommercial vs. non-commercial use\nAs defined in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, commercial use means developing products and earning commercial benefits from your activities. However, certain categories are explicitly excluded from this definition. Common examples of non-commercial uses include learning and self-education, open-source contributions without earning commercial benefits, any form of content creation, and hobby development.\nIt’s important to note that, if you’re using a non-commercial license, you cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics. We use this information to improve our products. The data we collect is exclusively that of anonymous feature usages of our IDEs. It is focused on what actions are performed and what types of functionality of the IDE are used. We do not collect any other data. This is similar to our Early Access Program (EAP) and is in compliance with our Privacy Policy.\nFAQ\nBelow are answers to the most common questions. Check out the full FAQ for more information.\nLicensing\nWhat features are included under the free license?\nWith the new non-commercial license type, you can enjoy a full-featured IDE that is identical to its paid version. The only difference is in the Code With Me feature – you get Code With Me Community with your free license.\nWhich license should I choose if I want to use CLion for both non-commercial and commercial projects?\nIf you intend to use CLion for commercial development for which you will receive direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation within the meaning of the definitions provided in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, you will need to purchase a commercial subscription (either individual or organizational). This license can then also be used for non-commercial development.\nHow do renewals and upgrades work now?\nNon-commercial subscriptions are issued for one year and will automatically renew after that. However, for the renewal to happen, you must have used the assigned license at least once during the last 6 months of the subscription period. If it has been more than 6 months since you last used an IDE activated with this type of license and the renewal did not occur automatically, you can request a new non-commercial subscription again at any time.\nAm I eligible for a refund if I’ve already bought a paid subscription but do non-commercial development?\nIf you’re unsure whether you qualify for a refund, you’ll find full details of our policy here. Please note that if you also work on projects that qualify as commercial usage, you can’t use the free license for them.\nAnonymous data collection \nDoes my IDE send any data to JetBrains?\nThe terms of the non-commercial agreement assume that the product may also electronically send JetBrains anonymized statistics (IDE telemetry) related to your usage of the product’s features. This information may include but is not limited to frameworks, file templates used in the product, actions invoked, and other interactions with the product’s features. This information does not contain personal data.\nIs there a way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics?\nWe appreciate that this might not be convenient for everyone, but there is unfortunately no way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics to JetBrains under the terms of the Toolbox agreement for non-commercial use. The only way to opt out is by switching to either a paid subscription or one of the complimentary options mentioned here.\nGetting a non-commercial subscription \nWhat should I do to apply for this subscription?\nIt can be easily done right inside your IDE:\nInstall CLion and run it.\nUpon startup, there will be a license dialog box where you can choose the Non-commercial use option.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nIf you’ve already started a trial period or have activated your IDE using a paid license, you still can switch to a non-commercial subscription by following these steps:\nGo to Help | Register.\nIn the window that opens, click on the Remove License button.\nChoose Non-commercial use.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nI don’t see the Non-commercial use option in my IDE. What should I do? \nThe most likely explanation for this is that you’re using an older version of CLion. Unfortunately, we don’t support obtaining the non-commercial license for any releases prior to CLion 2025.1.1. That’s it for today! If you don’t find an answer to your question, feel free to leave a comment or contact us at sales@jetbrains.com.\nYour CLion team\nJetBrains\nMake it happen. With code.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Today marks a major milestone in the Kotlin Multiplatform journey: the release of Compose Multiplatform 1.8.0, which brings Compose for iOS to Stable. With this update, Kotlin Multiplatform becomes a complete solution for mobile development, enabling flexible code sharing across both business logic and UI without compromising app quality or losing control over platform-specific capabilities.\nEverything you need to build apps for real-world use\nCompose Multiplatform for iOS now includes everything you need to build beautiful UIs for real-world apps:\nFeature parity with Jetpack Compose for all popular use cases.\nType-safe navigation with deep linking support.\nFlexible resource management. \nFirst-class accessibility support with VoiceOver, AssistiveTouch, and Full Keyboard Access.\nAnd more.\nVersion 1.8.0 finalizes the core API surface and brings targeted improvements to accessibility and navigation, along with a wide range of bug fixes and performance improvements (see the details in the 1.8.0 What’s New). All major APIs are now officially stable, with strong compatibility guarantees and minimal breaking changes expected in the future.\nThis stable foundation is backed by a rapidly growing ecosystem. Jetpack libraries are adopting multiplatform capabilities, and the community continues to contribute high-quality libraries, covering everything from architecture and dependency injection to image loading and graph rendering – all listed on klibs.io, the official Kotlin Multiplatform library catalog.\nWith these building blocks in place, you can start developing robust, feature-rich apps today – just like the teams already shipping Compose Multiplatform apps to production.\n\n\n\n\nApps that feel truly native\nSmooth, native behavior is what iOS users expect – and notice. Compose Multiplatform for iOS focuses on getting the details right, so apps feel familiar and responsive on the platform:\nScrolling behavior that matches native iOS physics.\nText editing with native selection and right-to-left support.\nDrag-and-drop integration with the system.\nAdaptive UI that respects system settings like font size and contrast.\nNavigation gestures that feel natural to iOS users.\n\n\nThe Respawn iOS app is built with Compose Multiplatform, sharing 96% of its code with Android.\n\n\n\nStaying true to the core Kotlin Multiplatform philosophy, Compose Multiplatform continues to bring together the best of native and cross-platform development. The 1.8.0 release introduces further improvements to interop with SwiftUI and UIKit, allowing you to seamlessly embed Compose in an existing app or incorporate native views into a Compose screen. This approach supports gradual adoption and gives you full control over how and where you share code.\nPerformance that’s ready for production\nA great user experience comes down to more than just UI behavior; it’s about performance, too. Smooth, responsive interactions are key to user satisfaction. That’s why performance was a core focus throughout this stabilization effort. With 1.8.0:\nStartup time is comparable to native apps, so your first frame arrives just as fast.\nScrolling performance is on par with SwiftUI, even on high-refresh-rate devices.\nCompose Multiplatform adds only ~9 MB to the size of an iOS app compared to a fully native SwiftUI app with the same UI logic and assets.\nYou can find the benchmark project  on GitHub. A detailed description of the methodology will be published soon at KMP Development portal.\n\n\n\nAnd most importantly, this matches what developers are seeing in practice. According to our latest survey, over 96% of teams using Compose Multiplatform on iOS report no major performance concerns.\n\nDevelopment tools that boost your efficiency\nTo make building Compose Multiplatform apps faster, smoother, and more enjoyable, we’re actively improving the KMP tooling. A new KMP plugin is coming soon for both IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. Besides features for writing common logic, it will bring support for Compose Previews in common code, and tools for managing resources.\nEven more exciting: Compose Hot Reload is already available. It lets you make changes to your UI code and see the results instantly, without restarting the app or losing the current state. It intelligently reloads code as you work – making UI iteration faster and smoother than ever.\n\n\n\n\nTry Compose Hot Reload\nProduction-ready and easy to adopt\nCompose Multiplatform for iOS now gives you the full package: stable APIs, great performance, a native feel, and modern tooling. Your users will feel right at home with the UI, while your team will notice the difference: fewer bugs, less duplicated work, and faster delivery across platforms.\nAnd best of all, you don’t need to start from scratch. Many teams — including Markaz, Wrike, Feres, and Physics Wallah — are already integrating Compose Multiplatform into large-scale apps, one screen or feature at a time. It fits into your workflow and grows with your needs.\n\nCompose Multiplatform for iOS is Stable. The ecosystem is thriving. The tools are ready. And now, we can’t wait to see the apps that you‘ll build.\nGet started with Compose Multiplatform\nCompose Multiplatform beyond mobile\nCompose Multiplatform for the web is also evolving rapidly. With 1.8.0, the Navigation library now supports browser back and forward buttons, making web apps feel more native. Developers can also experiment with pointer cursor customization and resource preloading APIs, which help reduce layout shifts and improve perceived performance.\nThese updates bring Compose Multiplatform for the web one step closer to providing a polished, production-ready experience. In a few days, we’ll share more about our vision and plans for Kotlin web development in the upcoming post “The Present and Future of Kotlin for the Web.” Stay tuned.\nRead more\nCompose Multiplatform 1.8.0 – release notes on GitHub\nWhat’s new in Compose Multiplatform 1.8.0 – detailed release notes on the documentation portal\nGet started with Compose Multiplatform – a tutorial\nCompose Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "JetBrains CodeCanvas is a tool for orchestrating Cloud Development Environments (CDEs). These environments aim to solve some of the long-standing issues of local development setups: tedious onboarding, environment drift, resource-heavy builds, and more. \nWhen we started building CodeCanvas, we knew dogfooding would be essential. Our goal was to experience the product the same way users would, face real-world issues early, and ensure the platform evolves in step with the needs of modern development teams. \nThis case study is the result of that process. We used CodeCanvas to build CodeCanvas, and in doing so, we’ve seen firsthand how cloud development environments can transform a team’s development workflow. Here’s what we learned.\n\n\n\n\nCodeCanvas: The technical context\n\nBefore we discuss how our development experience has changed with cloud development environments and CodeCanvas, we should touch upon the technical scope of the project we developed: CodeCanvas itself. CodeCanvas is a complex, resource-intensive system built with a modern, multi-language tech stack:\nBackend: Primarily written in Kotlin, with supporting components in Go\nFrontend: JavaScript\nBuild System: Gradle\nDatabase: PostgreSQL\nInfrastructure: Everything runs in Docker, with development environments launched in Kubernetes (configured via Helm)\nIDE: IntelliJ IDEA\nRunning this locally isn’t trivial. Because the CDEs mirror real-world deployments, local development requires Kubernetes through tools like Minikube or Kind. While we have helper scripts for bootstrap setup, there is still a lot of OS-specific manual configuration involved, especially when juggling multiple services and dependencies.\nIt’s also a heavyweight setup in terms of system requirements. Docker-in-Docker alone consumes considerable resources, and to run the full stack smoothly, you’d need:\nAt least 64 GB of RAM\nPlenty of disk space (due to the number and size of Docker images)\nA high-end CPU to handle builds, indexing, and service orchestration\nIn short, even getting started locally required a significant investment of time, hardware, and patience, which didn’t scale well across the team.\nHow our workflow changed\nWe started working on CodeCanvas with local development – there was no other choice early on. However, once CodeCanvas reached a usable state, we switched our team to a dedicated instance hosted in Amazon EKS. This instance gets updates as soon as features are implemented, making it our primary development environment and internal testing ground. Later, CodeCanvas became available company-wide, but our team continues to run on the bleeding edge. Here’s how this shift changed our day-to-day work.\nWorking on tasks and branches\n\nBefore (local)\nWe follow a Git-flow-like approach, and a typical developer works on 3 to 5 tasks per day. Each task lives on a separate branch, and switching between them locally requires checking out the branch, rebuilding the project, and waiting for indexing to complete. This process takes at least 15-20 minutes per switch, as CodeCanvas is a large and complex project. That’s an hour or more of lost time per developer per day just switching contexts. With a team of 10 developers, that equates to over 10 hours lost daily purely on environment management. Multiply that by a month, and the numbers become even harder to ignore.\nAfter (with CDEs)\nNow each task or branch lives in its own short-lived cloud development environment. Switching between branches means running a new environment, which takes under five minutes. No rebuilds, no conflicting states. Developers can easily work on 3 to 5 tasks a day without wasting time or mental energy on setup.\nCode reviews\n\nIn our Git flow-like approach, we never push changes directly to main. Every update goes through a feature branch and is merged only after a code review (more precisely, a merge request review). Each change is reviewed by at least one other team member (usually two).\n\n\n\n\nBefore (local)\nReviewers rarely ran the code they were reviewing. It was just too time-consuming to build and configure someone else’s branch locally. Reviews mostly checked diffs in a code-review tool (JetBrains Space) without executing anything. This limited our ability to catch behavioral or integration issues early.\nAfter (with CDEs)\nNow, reviewers create a fully functional cloud development environment from any merge request branch with one click. Here they can run the code and test the feature. Because these environments run in separate windows via JetBrains Gateway, reviewers don’t lose context – their main IDE window still holds the task they’re currently working on. This raised the quality of reviews significantly.\nStaying up-to-date\n\nBefore (local)\nEach developer was responsible for keeping their local environment up to date. When dependencies changed or new versions of tools were introduced, every team member had to individually update their setup. This led to inconsistencies, wasted time, and the occasional “works on my machine” issues.\nAfter (with CDEs)\nWith CodeCanvas, we moved to a centralized approach. A CodeCanvas CDE is based on a template that includes a Docker image with the required tooling and init scripts. To speed up startup times, we use the warm-up feature. It builds IDE indexes and runs a custom script to which we can add any other necessary preparations.\nIn short, everything that a developer previously had to do manually on their local machine, we now handle centrally via the template and the warm-up script.\nBut someone still has to maintain this setup, right? That’s where our On Duty rotation comes in. We have a Slack bot that randomly selects one developer each week to be the on-duty person. Their job is to keep the warm-up and init scripts working, update the Docker image(s), and handle team requests related to the setup. This way, a single person maintains the shared environment on behalf of the whole team. We can’t precisely measure the time saved, but it’s significant. On the team scale, it adds up to hours every week.\nOnboarding\n\n\n\n\nBefore (local)\nGetting a new team member up and running was a multi-day effort. They needed to install and configure the correct JDK, Node.js, Docker, PostgreSQL, Kubernetes (via Minikube or Kind), and more. Scripts helped, but much of the setup was OS-dependent and fragile. There was always something that didn’t work out of the box.\nAfter (with CDEs)\nNow, we just give them access to CodeCanvas. The environment already includes all necessary tools and configurations, including Kotlin and Go toolchains, the database, dependencies, and IDE plugins. On their very first day, a developer can open a pre-warmed dev environment and start writing code immediately.\nCross-project collaboration\n\nBefore (local)\nCodeCanvas integrates with other JetBrains projects like the IntelliJ IDEA platform. If someone needed to look into how a feature worked in another codebase or make a small change, they had to go through the same long configuration process for that new project. It was a huge barrier to casual collaboration.\nAfter (with CDEs)\nNow, we just run a new environment for the related project. Everything is preconfigured there too. CodeCanvas developers frequently use this to explore or debug features in IDEA without leaving their flow.\nThe takeaway\nIf we had to name just one game-changing benefit of using CDEs, it would be the ability to create short-lived, branch-based environments. Being able to run a fresh environment for any task or branch in under a minute and easily discard it when you’re done has completely transformed the way we work. No setup, no cleanup, and no fear of breaking anything – just focused development.\nAdoption challenges\n\nConverting a local setup into a CDE template\nOne of the biggest challenges was converting our local development environment into a working CDE template with proper init and warm-up scripts. This turned out to involve many puzzle pieces that aren’t always obvious when you’re working locally: Docker images with necessary tooling, IDE configuration, IDE plugins, various secrets for accessing project resources (e.g., internal Docker registry, internal plugin server, etc.), and many more.\nMaintaining this setup is an ongoing challenge. But we’ve solved that with our rotating On Duty role, which ensures everything stays in sync and up to date.\nRemote development support by the IntelliJ platform\nSeveral years ago, when we had just started working on CodeCanvas, remote development support in IntelliJ wasn’t fully mature. Some features didn’t work properly, and a few plugins weren’t yet compatible, making the early stages of dogfooding more difficult. Fortunately, things have improved a lot since then. Remote workflows are now well-supported, and IntelliJ IDEA works smoothly in remote mode.\nWhy some developers still use local setups\nWhile CodeCanvas has become the default for our team, not everyone has abandoned local development entirely. Some still keep a working copy of the project on their machines, and there are practical reasons:\n\n\n\n\n\nTooling gaps: For example, Helm isn’t preinstalled in dev environments. If someone needs to generate Helm templates, they either install it manually in their environment or do it locally.\n\n\n\n\nPlugin limitations: Some plugins, like the Go plugin, still have issues in remote development contexts. This makes certain workflows easier to handle locally.\nMissing customization options: Currently, CodeCanvas doesn’t allow developers to configure parts of the environment via code. If someone needs a unique tool or setup, there’s no easy way to add it for just themselves.\nSingle-IDE limitation: Right now, a CodeCanvas CDE supports only one IDE at a time. This is inconvenient for frontend developers who would prefer to work in both IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm (or VS Code) within the same environment.\nWhile some developers mix local and remote workflows, no one on the team uses only local development. However, there are several who use only remote development, which shows how far we’ve come.\nSome stats\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what our CodeCanvas usage looks like in numbers, along with some details about the infrastructure powering it:\n~30 users/month work with the CodeCanvas project. These include both CodeCanvas team members and developers from other teams.\n16 regular users, including developers, QA engineers, and a technical writer, actively work with the CodeCanvas project every month.\n~300 development environments/month are created, averaging about 10 environments per user.\nThe CDEs we use for the CodeCanvas project have 14 CPUs, 112 GB RAM, and 200 GB disk space – a setup that’s hard to replicate on a typical developer machine.\nIt takes 15–20 seconds to start a fully prepared CDE, thanks to our use of a standby pool.\n~56 developer hours/month are saved by using the warm-up feature, which prebuilds the project and indexes each night.\n~50% cost savings on AWS storage by storing CDE volumes as snapshots instead of full volumes.\nFinal thoughts\nWe started using CodeCanvas because we wanted to dogfood our own product. If we were building something else, we probably would have kept using local environments, just like most developers do today. When you’ve worked in local setups your entire career, you often don’t even realize there’s a problem.\n\n\n\n\nSwitching to remote development flipped that perspective. Only then did we realize how many inefficiencies we had just accepted as part of the job, like time lost to configuration, tedious rebuilds, and branch switching. It all became visible the moment we stepped outside that old paradigm.\n\n\n\n\nUsing CodeCanvas to build CodeCanvas gave us a real chance to rethink our development experience and build something we genuinely enjoy using. We’re building CodeCanvas to free developers from the pain of local environments, and now we know firsthand just how much of a difference that can make.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the May edition of Java Annotated Monthly! This month, we have a special guest – Anton Arhipov. He joins us to share standout articles and other discoveries that recently caught his expert eye. Alongside his picks, you’ll find your regular dose of Java and tech news, AI updates, and industry events that are too good to miss. \nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nAnton Arhipov\nAnton is a Developer Advocate at JetBrains, working with Kotlin, IntelliJ IDEA, and AI-driven developer tools. With a background in server-side development, he has spent over a decade building software for developers. A Java Champion since 2014, Anton speaks at conferences, shares insights on the Kotlin YouTube channel, and enjoys exploring new ideas in programming languages, AI-powered tooling, and developer workflows. He’s always experimenting with new tech, looking for ways to make coding more efficient and enjoyable.\n \nHere are some highlights from the world of AI programming tools this month. A lot is happening in this space, and these are just a few notable developments we’ve handpicked to share with you.\nLet’s start with the recent announcements first.\nThis month’s exciting news in this area is the announcement of the Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol by Google. A2A is an open standard designed to enable AI agents to securely communicate and collaborate across vendors, frameworks, and platforms. This marks a big step toward seamless interoperability between AI agents in enterprise environments.\nThe next biggie in the list is JetBrains rolling out a big update across our AI offerings:\nAI Assistant and the coding agent Junie are now available under one subscription with a free tier.\nWe’ve expanded support for top-tier models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.5 Pro.\nThere’s a new edit mode for multi-file changes.\nNow publicly available, Junie, your new virtual pair programmer, helps you take on complex development tasks like implementing changes across multiple files. \nA recent presentation titled Harnessing the Power of AI in IntelliJ IDEA showcased the features of  AI-assisted coding in JetBrains IDEs, from lightweight completions to full-blown agentic workflows. The key insight: Productivity comes from understanding what these tools can (and can’t) do. With tools like Junie, developers can supervise AI agents that carry out development plans and multi-file edits.\nAlong with the announcements, JetBrains also shared updates on Mellum, our 4B-parameter LLM designed for code completion. It includes language-specific versions for Python, Java, and Kotlin. The quality of the completions provided by this model is getting even better thanks to a local filter model that boosts suggestion accuracy by evaluating code context and user behavior.\nHowever, it’s not all about the releases and announcements. Understanding how to use these tools and figuring out the best practices is also important. Below are some interesting articles on that topic.\nAnthropic shared best practices for using Claude Code, their command-line tool for agentic programming, emphasizing the use of CLAUDE.md files to provide context and guide the agent in the same way prompts do. Claude can also help with tasks such as navigating Git history and writing commit messages, streamlining common development workflows.\nThe Spring AI ChatClient now supports powerful prompt engineering patterns, such as zero-shot, contextual, and self-consistency prompting to help developers build smarter, more responsive AI apps.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/webstorm/2025/05/improving-webstorm-performance-behind-the-scenes/",
        "pubDate": "Tue, 06 May 2025 08:01:37 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "At WebStorm, performance isn’t a side project – it’s a core part of what we do. Every millisecond counts when you’re deep in the flow, writing and navigating code. We’ve heard your feedback loud and clear: performance issues break that flow, and they’re frustrating. That’s why improving speed, responsiveness, and reliability is one of our key focus areas.\nIn this post, we want to take you behind the scenes of how we’re working to make WebStorm faster – from testing setups to tooling, from tracking regressions to learning from real-world projects. Whether you’ve experienced lags in typing, slow code completion, or sluggish indexing, know that we’re on it. Here’s how.\nBuilding a smarter, broader performance suite\nPerformance can mean different things depending on what you’re doing – typing in a JavaScript file, triggering completions in a TypeScript project, or running inspections in a Vue component. That’s why we’ve built a constantly evolving performance test suite that covers key IDE workflows, including:\nTyping latency\nCode completion responsiveness\nInspection speed\nIndexing performance\nEach of these areas is measured in isolation and under the same conditions. We test across multiple languages, frameworks, and library setups to understand how changes affect actual developer experiences.\n\n\n\n\nA dashboard that keeps us honest\nTo track performance regressions and improvements across the IDE, we rely on our internal tool, the IJ-Perf monitoring tool. It displays the collected performance metrics twice daily, giving us a steady stream of information we can monitor.\nWhen a change is made that might affect performance, like a modification to indexing or completion logic, IJ-Perf displays the new changed value on the IJ-Perf charts. But we don’t jump at the first sign of trouble. Performance can fluctuate for many reasons: CI noise, one-off slowdowns, or platform changes. That’s why we usually wait for multiple runs before investigating a suspected degradation. Once a slowdown proves consistent, we dig deeper.\nIJ-Perf gives us a detailed view of various IDE behaviors – from typing latency to indexing times. Some aggregate metrics are shown by default, but there’s also a toggle to inspect more granular data, like first completion time, helping us pinpoint specific pain points.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also improved how performance regressions are handled. For instance, we simplified the process of creating a YouTrack issue for an incident (performance or optimization) from IJ-Perf. That means if a regression is detected, we can create a ticket with the full context without leaving the dashboard.\nWe’ve even added custom workflows like bisect runs (thanks to contributions from multiple teams) to help narrow down the exact change that introduced a slowdown.\n\n\n\n\nDetecting performance degradations – early and often\nSome regressions are predictable – others are a bit sneakier. They might appear after a low-level platform update, a third-party change, or even a “fix” that improves correctness but impacts performance. That’s why we track performance continuously across builds using a mix of automated alerts, visual monitoring, and manual investigation.\nFor unit and integration performance tests, we have Slack notifications set up so that the team is alerted immediately if something drops below baseline. But for higher-level tests, it’s often faster and more effective to visually inspect performance graphs in IJ-Perf and trust our experience to spot anomalies. Sometimes a slowdown isn’t a bug at all, but just a side effect of a necessary change.\nOnce we spot something, we use a set of internal tools to speed up the investigation:\nOne-click YouTrack issue creation with all relevant information for investigation attached (the list of commits, CPU snapshots before and after the change, and the percentage increase or decrease).\nThe bisect button helps trigger tests against a specific set of commits and find the commit that caused a change on the IJ-Perf charts.\nFinding out what caused a regression is often trickier than seeing that one happened. But with the right mix of automation and human insight, we get there – and fix it.\n\n\n\n\nReal projects, real insights\nOne of the most valuable sources of insight is our users.\nWhenever you send us reproducible examples or open-source projects where performance is noticeably off, it helps us immensely. These real-world setups often become part of our testing suite, which means your contributions help improve performance for everyone.\nWe also get invaluable help from the community. Just recently, a user spotted and fixed a performance issue on their own. After reviewing the fix, we found it not only solid, but applicable across many projects. (Okay, full disclosure: the user was an ex-JetBrains developer. But still – once a JetBrains dev, always a JetBrains dev).\nThe hardest part? Reproducing the bug\nPerformance issues are notoriously hard to reproduce. They depend on many variables, like project size, installed plugins, system specs, and sometimes even specific coding habits. This is the main reason why we sometimes still release our products with performance bugs despite having tools set up to monitor performance.\nWe don’t have a magic tool (yet) to make this easier, so reproduction usually comes down to good old-fashioned sharing, whether it’s a project, a detailed list of steps, or a video. We know that takes time and effort, so when you take the time to send us something reproducible, it really helps, and we’re genuinely grateful.\nWhat’s next?\nWe’re not stopping here. There are several ongoing initiatives aimed at improving performance across the board. The WebStorm team is focusing on:\nAnalyzing real-world CPU snapshots submitted by users to identify and resolve bottlenecks.\nDetecting out-of-memory issues in the TypeScript language service and prompting users to increase the heap size when needed.\nExperimenting with a service-based type engine, which improves performance in some project types, though the results vary. We’re still evaluating its overall impact.\nOn the platform side, there are broader efforts and approaches, including better memory diagnostics and more granular, opt-in telemetry that helps us understand where time and resources are being spent.\nThese changes may be incremental, but performance work often is. We’re committed to continuing it, release after release.\nWe’re in this together\nPerformance isn’t just a one-time fix – it’s an ongoing commitment. We know there’s always more to do, and we’re constantly listening, measuring, and improving. If you’ve experienced slowdowns or have a project that reproduces a performance hiccup, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us.\nEvery bug we squash and optimization we make adds to a smoother experience for everyone using WebStorm.\nThanks for choosing WebStorm. We’ll keep pushing to make it better.\nThe WebStorm team",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2025/05/2025-2-roadmap/",
        "pubDate": "Mon, 05 May 2025 08:02:55 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve begun work on our next major release, 2025.2, which we plan to introduce in July. After reviewing your feedback and our strategic goals, we’ve prioritized the following areas for development:\n🚀 CLion Nova language engine improvements and bug fixes\n🎛️ New features for embedded development\n🤖 Support for Junie, JetBrains’ smart coding agent\nRead on to learn more about our planned updates.\nOur team is committed to creating an IDE that makes development smooth and productive. However, the following is only a preliminary roadmap. We can’t guarantee that all the issues and features listed below will be addressed and implemented in CLion 2025.2. Unexpected circumstances could require us to modify our plans or implementation timelines for some items.\nCLion Nova\nThe CLion Nova language engine will receive a number of new features and enhancements that will bring it closer to becoming the default IDE engine for all users. Here are the major planned updates:\nNew smart keys: We will continue adding the smart keys available in CLion Classic that are missing in CLion Nova. In addition to the ones we already included in 2025.1, we plan to add several more, such as Jump outside closing bracket/quote and Reformat block on typing ‘}’ (CPP-42032).\nFaster typing assistance for remote development: We’re still working on improving the typing assistant’s responsiveness for remote development and plan to have a working solution in time for the 2025.2 release. As a result, actions such as smart indentation when you press Enter or automatic insertion of pair parentheses, brackets, and quotes will be as fast as in local mode.\nFixes for issues involving missed compilation errors: CLion Nova may overlook some possible compilation errors when analyzing your source code and may not show the corresponding warnings in the editor. As a result, these errors only appear in the terminal after the build is complete. After fixing this issue, CLion Nova will catch all the errors before you click Build, Run, or Debug.\nFixes for reformatting issues: We plan to address a problem that results in CLion Nova’s formatter not always working as expected. One example of this is when, after pressing Enter, the indentation on the next line doesn’t follow the settings in your code style scheme.\nEmbedded development\nFor embedded development, we’ll focus on providing our real-time variable view (Live Watches), extending the debug server functionality, and improving CLion’s FreeRTOS integration.\nLive Watches: Many embedded developers need to monitor variable values and memory changes in real time without stopping a program, for example, when working with Bluetooth devices that require a persistent connection. Live Watches will make this possible. We’ve been working on this feature for some time (​​CPP-22056), and we apologize to those who expected it to be implemented in the current release. This feature will be one of our main priorities for 2025.2.\nESP32 debug server: Although we planned to add a configuration option for the ESP32 debug server in 2025.1, we had to switch to one designed specifically for STM32 chips instead. So, a new template for ESP32 MCUs will complement the already available Generic, SEGGER J-Link, and STM32 templates. Read our documentation to learn more about debug servers and when they’re helpful.\nImproving CLion’s FreeRTOS integration: We plan to make the support of FreeRTOS (an open-source real-time operating system) more flexible. This includes displaying FreeRTOS tasks in the way the feature is implemented for threads and adding the ability to view FreeRTOS objects in the debugger, support for new architectures, such as Arm Cortex-M33, and more (see the list of related issues).\nSupport for Junie\nJetBrains recently introduced Junie, an AI coding agent that can serve as a full-fledged pair programmer. It speeds up your development process by answering questions, performing complex tasks, and following guidelines (learn more).\nJunie is already available as a plugin for several JetBrains IDEs, but not yet for CLion. Adding Junie support for CLion comes with its own challenges. We’re excited about the prospect and are working to make this available in 2025.2. While we can’t fully confirm this timeline just yet, we want you to know that this is an active area of focus for us.\nUI improvements for the Project tool window\nThe Project tool window allows you to navigate through your project’s directories and files, including external sources such as SD cards, when working on Zephyr or ESP-IDF projects. Currently, it’s not always easy to distinguish between internal and external sources when looking at their path prefixes displayed in the tool window. For 2025.2, we’re making several improvements to the Project tool window UI to help you distinguish external sources more clearly (CPP-33951).\nConclusion\nThere’s more exciting news about CLion just around the corner – stay tuned!\nIn the meantime, we encourage you to check out our latest release, 2025.1, which includes many great features for CLion Nova, debugging, embedded development, and project formats.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we continue improving Qodana, we’re excited to introduce a set of powerful updates that enhance performance, improve security analysis, and offer better integration opportunities for you and your team. Let’s take a look at some of the most exciting changes with the Qodana 2025.1 release!\nTry Qodana\nOWASP Top 10: covering even more categories\nAt Qodana, we take security very seriously, and recently discussed inspections that commonly make it to the OWASP Top 10. \nWe also know that configuring taint rules for the security analyzers can be a difficult and time-consuming task, often requiring manual effort to detect rules and correctly configure it.\nTo simplify this process, we provide predefined taint configuration, built on various benchmarks and external providers, automatically covering common sources and sinks. \nQodana now includes predefined taint rules for the most common categories of OWASP Top 10:2021 vulnerabilities: (A01, A03, A07, A08, A10). This significantly improves issue detection out of the box, minimizing user effort while ensuring broad security coverage.\nTo address issues with the problem’s trace reconstruction, we had to rethink the way issue propagation being shown to the user. Now we’re capable of showing even more complex cases including tricky aliasing.\n\n\n\n\nFeedback received and addressed: for those who need deeper customization, taint rules can be configured using KTS files, allowing users to define both library and user codes as sources or sinks. This flexibility ensures that security analysis adapts to project-specific needs without unnecessary complexity.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nAutomatic detection for common security flaws.\n700+ new configuration entries covering common frameworks and libraries.\nThe ability to add configuration on your own: customize via KTS files to define sources and sinks.\nEnhanced Azure & GitLab CI/CD Integrations\nTo improve adoption beyond GitHub, we’ve made major enhancements to Azure and GitLab integrations. These changes streamline workflows and enable better visibility into analysis results.\nAzure improvements\nIn Azure, it’s now possible to reduce the time spent on PR analysis by only analyzing files that were changed using pr-mode. Also, instead of getting results in the build log, the Qodana extension provides you with a summary in the Extensions tab. \nThis release also integrates the powerful Qodana Quick Fix feature into your analysis. This allows you to fix some problems in your code and apply them to the branch you’ve analyzed or create a pull request with suggested fixes. To use this feature you will need to update the Qodana pipeline configuration.\nTL;DR\nGet faster PR analysis by checking only modified files.\nResults now appear in the Extensions tab instead of cluttering the build log.\nAuto-apply fixes to the analyzed branch or create a PR with suggested changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGitLab enhancements\nNow you can use the new Qodana component to perform analysis in your repository. This means that instead of using the linter container directly, you can configure Qodana with a predefined set of needed arguments (there is no need to understand all the steps to launch Qodana; the component does it for you). \nThe new component supports mr-mode (the same as pr-mode in Azure) for fast analysis in merge requests, which analyses only the changed files, summary comments in merge requests and quick fixes. To use it you’ll need to include the Qodana component in your pipeline configuration file. \nTL;DR\nUse the new Qodana component for simplified configuration.\nIt supports merge request (MR) mode to analyze only changed files.\nit provides summary comments and quick fixes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPro C++ Linter [EAP]\nBased on demand, especially from our .NET, and Rider communities, we’re introducing Qodana for C/C++. This advanced linter goes beyond Clang-Tidy to detect critical issues like memory leaks, null dereferences, and uninitialized memory usage to name a few.\nThe old community-licensed linter that was previously known under this name is now called “Qodana Community for C/C++”.\nWhy upgrade?\nThe new C++ paid linter for professional teams: \nIncludes MISRA, and Data Flow Analysis for error tracking during value propagation.\nIs a more powerful option than Clang-Tidy for bug detection.\nHas easy integration with Qodana CLI and Docker.\nExample of a DFA analysis inspection catching a memory leak.\n\n\n\nWould you have caught this in a normal code review?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are DFA inspections?\nDFA (or data flow) inspections are based on a more thorough code analysis, such as tracking possible variable states through possible execution paths. Such introspection allows DFA to catch some of the more sneaky errors in your code. For example, these inspections are capable of finding nullptr dereferences, memory leaks, out of bounds memory accesses, and more.\nYou can try this new linter using Qodana CLI or by manually running the jetbrains/qodana-cpp docker image with a token from Qodana Cloud.\nSwitching to Kotlin K2 Mode\nWe’ve enabled K2 mode for qodana-jvm and qodana-jvm-community linters. This update aligns with JetBrains’ move towards K2 in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 and offers improved performance and stability, along with support for new Kotlin 2.1 features.\nPotential issues to be aware of:\nThird-party plugins might not support K2 yet.\nSome inspections are still being implemented (see details).\nNeed to switch back? \nThere are a number of way to do this depending on the way linter is configured. But you could simply set the property “idea.kotlin.plugin.use.k2” to “false” in your linter configuration.\nView Documentation\nWhat to do next\n\nIf you’re using the latest tag, you don’t need to do anything to enjoy the benefits of our new Qodana 2025.1 release. If not, please change from 2024.4 to 2025.1 to update. Users of GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and Circle CI can find the latest version of the extension here.\nWith these new enhancements, you have greater potential to substantially improve your coding experience. For further information, including detailed setup instructions for each feature, please refer to our official documentation. \nWe’re continuously improving Qodana to provide better inspections, integrations, and security features.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Here’s something that might surprise you: if you’re using WebStorm, you already have access to a professional-grade database IDE. That’s right, the full-featured DataGrip database toolset isn’t just a separate product or an additional paid plugin anymore; it’s bundled into WebStorm. Even if you’re comfortable with other IDEs and their database extensions, you might find some compelling features here that could enhance your database workflow.\nTL;DR\nThe powerful features of DataGrip, JetBrains’ database IDE, are included in WebStorm for free. Highlights include smart schema-aware code completion, query plan analyzer, an optimized data editor, automatic documentation writing, and an AI query assistant. Try this enterprise-grade database support in your JavaScript and TypeScript IDE to enjoy smoother and more streamlined database work.\nEssential database features you might have missed\n1. Smart code completion that understands your schema\nLook, we’ve all been there – typing out table names like it’s 1999. But here’s the thing: WebStorm’s database tools don’t just autocomplete; they understand your entire database schema.\nSELECT u.* FROM us--\nBefore you even finish typing, WebStorm knows you probably mean users and that you’ll want to join it with user_preferences based on your schema. It’s like having a really smart pair programmer who actually remembers the database schema.\n\n2. Query plans that explain issues with your database\nThe visual query plan analyzer is a powerful tool that helps you understand and optimize your database queries. Here’s how to use it:\nWrite your query in the database console:\nSELECT * FROM users \nJOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id \nWHERE orders.status = 'processing'\nRight-click on the query, then select Explain Plan.\nIn the Explain Plan window, you’ll see:\n\nA visual execution plan showing how the database processes your query.\nA cost associated with the operation. \n\n\n\n\nThe associated cost is a useful metric that helps you identify costly operations and enables you to further optimize them. \n3. Data editor that makes database updates surprisingly effortless\nWe’ve all been there. The product demo is in 15 minutes, and someone notices a typo in the production database – that important customer of yours should be named “Whole Foods”, not “Hole Foods”! You need to quickly update a status flag on several test accounts. Your options: Craft a precise UPDATE statement and triple-check it, or just… fix it directly.\nForget writing tedious UPDATE statements – the integrated data editor gives you spreadsheet-like powers over your precious data for those “just need to fix this one thing real quick” moments:\nDirect cell editing for the impatient pragmatists:\nDouble-click any cell to edit values directly.\nChanges get highlighted until you commit them.\nPress Tab to move through cells like a spreadsheet pro.\nHit Enter to save, Escape to cancel, and submit with ⌘Enter / Ctrl+Enter.\nBulk edits for when repetitive tasks threaten your zen:\nSelect multiple cells to edit similar values simultaneously.\nCopy-paste directly from Excel (yes, they thought of that).\nConstraint-aware edits for avoiding that 3:00 am production emergency call:\nForeign key constraints are actively enforced while editing.\nData type validation before you commit the change.\nColor-coding for modified, invalid, and conflicting values.\nWhat you’d write without the data editor:\nUPDATE users SET status = 'premium', trial_ends_at = NULL WHERE id IN (1043, 1044, 1045, 1046);\nUPDATE users SET email = 'sarah.jones@newdomain.com' WHERE id = 2967;\nWith the data editor, these become mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts. And because WebStorm knows you occasionally try to save invalid data, it warns you before submitting changes that would violate constraints.\n4. Documentation that writes itself\nBecause, let’s face it, you weren’t going to write it anyway. The automated documentation generator creates comprehensive schema diagrams and details all document relationships and constraints.\nDiagrams are extremely useful to document the current status quo of a system and use as a baseline for discussing changes. By right-clicking on the database and selecting Diagrams | Show Diagram, you can get an accurate ER diagram of the existing system in place.\n\n\n\n\n5. AI query assistant (for when SQL syntax makes your brain hurt)\nLet’s be honest – not everyone dreams in SQL, and that’s okay. Instead of wrestling with JOIN and PARTITION BY clauses at 3:00 am, you can now just tell JetBrains AI Assistant what you want in plain English, like you’re ordering a coffee:\n“Show me active users who haven’t placed an order in the last 30 days”.\nMuch better than trying to remember if it’s LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN for the fifth time in one day, right? The AI query assistant understands your database schema and translates your human thoughts into proper SQL – no more copy-paste roulette.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI Assistant just got better when working with databases in the 2025.1 release, and we highly recommend giving it another look!\nWhy should JavaScript developers care?\nIf we’re building modern web applications, let’s be honest with ourselves. We’re probably dealing with databases whether we like it or not. Sure, your ORM handles most cases, but when it doesn’t, you need real database tools. And switching between your IDE and a separate database editor is about as efficient as using Internet Explorer 6 for development.\nThe bottom line\nWebStorm isn’t just an IDE for handling JavaScript and TypeScript – it’s a complete development environment that includes one of the best database tools in the industry. Having your database tools integrated directly into your development workflow means less context switching, better productivity, and a more streamlined development experience.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "2024년에 Redis 7.2.4 부터 라이센스 이슈로 Valkey 가 fork 되면서 많은 사람들이 Redis와 Valkey 중에 무엇을 사용해야 하는가? 그럼 어떤 차이가 있는지에 대한 질문이 꽤 많습니다. 그래서 거기에 대한 간단한 의견(답정너) 를 소개하려고 합니다.\n 일반적으로 클라우드 기반에서 사용하던 분들 특히 AWS의 ElastiCache 를 쓰는 분들은 그냥 Redis 쓰는 것보다 Valkey로 가셔도 전혀 문제가 없습니다.(비용이 더 싸진다는 장점만 있다고 보시면 됩니다.) 왜냐하면 클라우드에서 쓸 수 있는 Redis 버전은 기본적으로 7.2.4 의 이전 버전들이라, 그 시점은 Valkey가 Fork 되면서 그대로 이전했기 때문입니다. 즉, 기존 Redis 를 제공하는 클라우드의 내부 버전이 다르더라도 그냥 제품명만 Redis -> Valkey로 바꿔서 그대로 제공이 됩니다. 그냥 바꾸면 변경이 되는 수준입니다.\n 그럼, 실제로 문제가 되는 것은 어떤 상황일까요? 현재 우리가 Redis를 자체적으로 운영하고 있는데, Valkey로 바꾸어야 되는가 입니다. 이 이야기를 하기 전에 Redis와 Valkey가 이제 차이가 나는가? 라는 주제 부터 얘기를 해야 합니다. Redis 8과 Valkey 8이 2025년에 나오면서 조금씩 큰 차이가 벌어지고 있습니다. \n Redis Module 이야 대부분이 원래 RSAL 라이센스라, 클라우드에서 제공이 안되었지만, Redis 는 사용자의 편의성 기능과 AI쪽에 좀 더 집중하고 있는 모습입니다. \n Redis는 7 버전 이후에 Hash 에 서브 Key를 Expire 하는 기능이 들어갔지만, Valkey에는 들어가지 않았습니다.(포크가 되는 시점에, 개발되고 있다가, 포크되고 반영된…) Redis 8에는 VectorSet 이나 AutoComplete 등 AI 지원 기능이나 편의성 기능이 이번에 많이 추가 되었습니다.(내부적으로 콜렉션등에 성능개선도 있었다고…)\n Valkey 는 8 버전부터, CPU Cache Line을 맞추거나, 포인터 접근 횟수를 줄여서, 좀더 메모리를 아끼거나, 성능을 높이는 쪽으로 가고 있습니다. 그래서 8부터는 명령이나 이런 부분에서 어느정도 차이가 나고 있습니다.(다만 아직 기본 명령 보다는, 모듈쪽에서 차이가 나는거 같습니다.)\n 그럼 발전성은 어떨까요? Redis 8이 AGPLv3가 추가되면서 기업에서 뭔가 사용하기가 어려워졌지만, 여전히 Redis(회사) 가 많은 지원을 하고 있고, 가장 많은 컨트리뷰션을 하고 있습니다. 반대로 Valkey는 리눅스 파운데이션과 AWS, 알리바바 등 지원이 있지만, Redis 보다는 조금 덜 활성화 된걸로 보입니다.\n 결국 선택의 우리의 몫입니다. 다만 정말 특별한 기능을 사용하지 않고, 기존 흐름을 따르는 형태에서는 뭘 선택해도 당장은 큰 문제는 없어보입니다. 하지만, 새로운 Redis 기능을 써야 한다면, 이제 좀 고민을 하셔야 될듯 합니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "지금부터의 의견은 100% 내 개인적인 의견이다.\n 2024년 Redis 생태계에서 아주 충격적인 일이 일어났다. Redis 7.2.4 부터 Redis 의 오픈소스 라이센스가 기존의 BSDv3 에서 Redis Source Available License v2 (RSALv2) 와 Server Side Public License v1 (SSPLv1) 로 바꿔버린 것이다. 그러면서 Valkey 라는 Redis Fork 프로젝트가 새롭게 생겨나게 된 계기가 되었다.\n 먼저 RSALv2 와 SSPLv1 라이센스에 대해서 먼저 알아보자. 이 두 해당 라이센스는 공식적인 오픈소스 라이센스로 인정받지 못한다. 즉 기본적으로 Redis는 더 이상 오픈소스로 인정 되지 않는다는 얘기였다.(그래서 각 종 리눅스 배포판에서 빠지게 되었다.)\n 일단 각 라이센스 부터 정리하면. 아래와 같다.\n\n라이센스비고\nRSALv2비상업적 또는 자체 내부 서비스 용도로는 사용 가능.\nSaaS(서비스형 소프트웨어) 형태로 Redis를 제공하는 것은 금지.\n예: AWS, GCP 같은 클라우드 벤더가 Redis를 서비스로 제공하는 것 제한.\n수정 및 배포는 가능하지만, 상업적 Redis-as-a-Service 제공은 불허.\nSSPLv1기본적으로 GPLv3 기반이지만, 클라우드 제공자에게 훨씬 더 엄격함.\nRedis를 서비스로 제공하고 싶다면, 해당 서비스 전체의 소스코드를 공개해야 함.\n예: Redis와 함께 사용하는 관리 도구, 오케스트레이션 시스템 등도 모두 공개해야 함.\n사실상 대기업의 SaaS 제공을 어렵게 만드는 라이선스입니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n 딱 살펴보면 알겠지만, Redis를 그냥 사용하는 것은 되지만, Redis As a Service 를 못하게 하는 라이센스라고 보면 된다. 여기서 타겟이 되는 것은 AWS Elasticach 나 GCP 같은 클라우드 업체이며, 더 이상 Redis 를 서비스 할 수 없게 된다.(정확히는 Redis 7.2.4 부터이고 그 이전까지는 여전히 BSDv3 이므로 상관없다.)\n Redis(회사) 에서 말하는 것은 오픈소스 레디스에 우리는 이렇게 투자를 많이하는데, 클라우드 업체에서는 과실만 따먹고, 여기에 대한 투자를 하지 않는다라는 것이다.(물론, 알리바바 클라우드나 AWS에서도 꽤 공헌이 있었다.)\n 여기서 재미있는 것은 Redis(회사) 의 엔터프라이즈 버전이나, AWS의 Elasticash 같은 경우 Open Source Redis의 엄청난 개조버전이라는 것이다.(여기서, Redis 엔터프라이즈 버전은 오픈소스 Redis를 앞에서 Redis(회사)에서 만든 Proxy가 붙어서 다른 형태로 동작하게 하는 걸로 알고 있다.) 즉, 이렇게 수정한 버전을 서비스를 할려면, 소스를 공개하라는 뜻이다.\n 그런데 몇일전에, Redis 8을 릴리즈하면서 이제 AGPLv3 를 라이센스에 추가했다. 관련 글에는 고객들이 오픈소스 라이센스일때 더 적용하기 쉽다고 해서, AGPLv3를 추가했다는 것이다. 그리고 AGPLv3는 인정 받는 오픈소스 라이센스가 맞다. \n 그럼 AGPLv3는 어떤 특징이 있을까?\n가장 “자유로운” 라이선스처럼 보일 수 있으나, 기업 입장에서는 부담이 큼.\n네트워크 상에서 Redis를 서비스 형태로 제공할 경우, 소스코드 전체를 공개해야 함.\nRedis를 커스터마이징하거나 변경한 버전을 서비스로 제공하면, 해당 서비스 전체 소스도 공개해야 함.\n 살펴보면 SSPLv1 과 유사하다는 것을 알 수 있다. 즉, 결국 Redis 오픈 소스 버전을 쓰고 싶다면, 결과물을 공개하라는 의지가 계속 들어가 있는 것이다.\n 당연히 오픈소스 Redis 로 다시 돌아왔지만, 그 목적이 예전처럼 더 자유로웠던 BSDv3가 아닌 것은, 그 목적이 어느 정도 명확해서라고 생각한다.",

        "summary": "USB 포트는 원래 데이터 전송을 위한 인터페이스였지만, 시간이 지나면서 전력 공급 수단으로도 활용되기 시작했다. 이를 지원하기 위해 USB BC가 도입되었고, 기존보다 높은 전류를 제공할 수 있도록 개선되었다. 하지만 USB BC 1.2는 5V 전압 고정이라는 한계를 갖고 있어, 노트북 같은 고출력 기기를 충전하기에는 부족했다. 이런 제약 조건을 해결하기 위해 제조사마다 별도의 급속 충전 방식을 만들기 시작했고, 이로 인해 특정 브랜드의 디바이스는 해당 브랜드의 충전기에서만 고속 충전이 가능한 호환성 문제도 발생하였다.\n\n이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 USB-IF는 USB Power Delivery(a.k.a. USB PD)라는 전력 공급을 위한 새로운 표준을 만들었다. USB PD는 전압과 전류를 ",

ChatGPT가 제 직업, 취미, 심지어 제가 좋아하는 음식까지 다 기억하고 있더라고요! 바로 불필요한 것들은 삭제했죠. 그런데 이게 어디까지 삭제된 걸까요?  \n \n  데이터 사용 옵트아웃: 내 정보로 AI를 훈련시키지 않기\n여기서 더 나아가, 여러분의 데이터가 AI 모델 개선에 사용되지 않도록 설정할 수도 있어요:\n설정으로 이동\n'데이터 제어(Data Controls)' 탭 선택\n'모델 개선을 위한 데이터 사용' 옵션을 '꺼짐'으로 설정\nChatGPT Team, Enterprise, Edu 고객의 경우 기본적으로 이 옵션이 꺼져 있다고 하지만, 일반 사용자는 직접 확인하고 설정을 변경해야 해요.\n \n  실용적인 가이드라인: 균형 잡기\n결국은 편리함과 프라이버시 사이의 균형인데요, 제가 실제로 사용하는 몇 가지 팁을 공유할게요:\n상황\n권장 설정\n이유\n\n\n\n\n일상적인 질문\n기본 설정\n상대적으로 안전한 정보\n\n\n업무 관련 문의\n임시 채팅\n민감한 기업 정보 보호\n\n\n개인 건강/재정\n기억 끄기+임시 채팅\n최대한의 프라이버시 보호\n\n\n창작 활동\n기억 켜기\n지속적인 프로젝트 작업에 유리\n\n\n\n중요한 팁: 정기적으로 (한 달에 한 번 정도) 저장된 기억을 검토하고 불필요한 정보는 삭제하세요. 디지털 정리는 이제 필수예요!\n \n  무엇을 기대할 수 있을까?\n기술은 계속 발전하고 있고, ChatGPT의 기억 기능도 더욱 정교해질 거예요. 앞으로는 아마도 이런 변화를 기대할 수 있을 것 같아요:\n더 세밀한 프라이버시 제어 - 특정 주제나 카테고리별로 기억 기능을 설정할 수 있는 옵션\n차별화된 데이터 저장 기간 - 일부 정보는 24시간만, 다른 정보는 영구적으로 저장하는 등의 설정\n로컬 기억 저장 - 개인 기기에만 정보를 저장하는 옵션 (클라우드 저장 없이)\n\n\n \n뭐가 됐든, 우리 사용자들이 적극적으로 목소리를 내고 더 나은 프라이버시 보호를 요구하는 것이 중요해요. 내 정보는 내가 지켜야 하니까요!\n \n저는 개인적으로 ChatGPT 활용과 프라이버시 보호 사이에서 균형을 찾아가는 중이에요. 여러분은 어떤가요? ChatGPT의 기억 기능이 도움이 된다고 느끼나요, 아니면 좀 부담스러운가요? 댓글로 여러분의 경험을 공유해주세요. 모두의 의견이 궁금해요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: ChatGPT가 저장한 내 정보를 완전히 삭제할 수 있나요?\nA: 네, 설정에서 '기억 관리'로 들어가 저장된 정보를 검토하고 삭제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이미 모델 훈련에 사용된 데이터는 완전히 제거하기 어려울 수 있어요.\nQ: 기억 기능을 끄면 ChatGPT가 덜 유용해지나요?\nA: 어느 정도는 그렇습니다. 맥락을 이해하지 못하거나 반복적인 설명이 필요할 수 있어요. 하지만 중요한 정보는 각 세션에서 다시 제공하는 것이 안전합니다.\nQ: 임시 채팅과 일반 채팅의 차이점은 무엇인가요?\nA: 임시 채팅은 대화 기록을 저장하지 않고, 해당 세션이 끝나면 모든 정보가 삭제됩니다. 반면 일반 채팅은 히스토리에 남고 미래 상호작용에 영향을 줍니다.\nQ: 비즈니스용 ChatGPT는 개인용보다 더 안전한가요?\nA: ChatGPT Team과 Enterprise 버전은 기본적으로 데이터를 모델 훈련에 사용하지 않도록 설정되어 있어 일반적으로 더 높은 프라이버시 보호를 제공합니다.\nQ: 다른 AI 챗봇들도 비슷한 기억 기능을 가지고 있나요?\nA: 대부분의 현대적 AI 챗봇들은 어떤 형태로든 사용자 정보를 저장합니다. 이는 편리함을 위한 것이지만, 항상 해당 서비스의 개인정보 처리방침을 확인하는 것이 중요합니다.\n \n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"ChatGPT가 저장한 내 정보를 완전히 삭제할 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 설정에서 '기억 관리'로 들어가 저장된 정보를 검토하고 삭제할 수 있습니다. 하지만 이미 모델 훈련에 사용된 데이터는 완전히 제거하기 어려울 수 있어요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"기억 기능을 끄면 ChatGPT가 덜 유용해지나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"어느 정도는 그렇습니다. 맥락을 이해하지 못하거나 반복적인 설명이 필요할 수 있어요. 하지만 중요한 정보는 각 세션에서 다시 제공하는 것이 안전합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"임시 채팅과 일반 채팅의 차이점은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"임시 채팅은 대화 기록을 저장하지 않고, 해당 세션이 끝나면 모든 정보가 삭제됩니다. 반면 일반 채팅은 히스토리에 남고 미래 상호작용에 영향을 줍니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"비즈니스용 ChatGPT는 개인용보다 더 안전한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"ChatGPT Team과 Enterprise 버전은 기본적으로 데이터를 모델 훈련에 사용하지 않도록 설정되어 있어 일반적으로 더 높은 프라이버시 보호를 제공합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"다른 AI 챗봇들도 비슷한 기억 기능을 가지고 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"대부분의 현대적 AI 챗봇들은 어떤 형태로든 사용자 정보를 저장합니다. 이는 편리함을 위한 것이지만, 항상 해당 서비스의 개인정보 처리방침을 확인하는 것이 중요합니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

ChatGPT, Claude, 구글 Gemini 같은 서비스들이 대표적인데, 이런 서비스들은 우리가 가진 기기의 성능에 상관없이 강력한 AI 기능을 제공해 줘요. 굳이 비싼 하드웨어를 구매하지 않아도, 인터넷만 연결되어 있다면 이런 서비스들을 활용할 수 있다는 거죠.\n작년에 제가 오래된 노트북으로도 ChatGPT 잘만 썼거든요. 버벅거림도 없었고, 솔직히 온디바이스 AI가 주는 장점을 크게 못 느꼈어요. 물론 오프라인에서도 AI를 써야 한다면 이야기가 달라지겠지만, 대부분의 상황에선 클라우드 AI로도 충분하더라고요.\n3. 성능이 계속 발전 중이에요\n기술은 항상 발전해요. 지금 출시된 첫 세대 AI PC보다 앞으로 출시될 모델들이 더 강력하고 효율적일 가능성이 높아요. 특히 NPU 성능은 앞으로 더 발전할 여지가 많죠.\n제 경험상, 신기술이 나오면 1~2년 정도 기다렸다가 구매하는 게 좋더라고요. 초기 모델은 항상 문제가 있기 마련이고, 가격도 비싸고... 조금만 기다리면 더 좋은 성능에 더 저렴한 가격으로 살 수 있으니까요.\n4. 기존 PC도 AI 작업 가능해요\n사실 NPU가 없어도 AI 작업이 불가능한 건 아니에요. 현대의 CPU와 GPU도 AI 작업을 처리할 수 있어요. 물론 NPU만큼 효율적이진 않지만, 대부분의 일반적인 AI 작업은 기존 하드웨어로도 충분히 가능해요.\n제 컴퓨터도 꽤 오래됐는데, 스테이블 디퓨전 같은 AI 이미지 생성 프로그램도 돌아가고, 간단한 AI 모델도 실행할 수 있더라고요. 물론 좀 느리긴 하지만... 쓸 수는 있어요.\n5. 배터리 효율성은 아직 검증 중이에요\n제조사들은 AI PC가 배터리 효율성을 높여준다고 주장하지만, 실제 사용 환경에서 이것이 얼마나 효과적인지는 아직 완전히 검증되지 않았어요. 특히 NPU를 활용하는 앱이 많지 않은 상황에서는 배터리 효율 향상을 체감하기 어려울 수 있어요.\n얼마 전에 AI PC를 구매한 동료가 있는데, 배터리 지속 시간이 기존 노트북과 크게 다르지 않다고 하더라고요. \"그니까요, 광고에서 말하는 것만큼 혁신적이진 않아요.\" 라고 말하더라구요.\n \n그럼 언제 AI PC가 필요할까요?  \n물론, 모든 사람에게 AI PC가 불필요하다는 건 아니에요. 특정 상황에서는 지금이라도 AI PC가 유용할 수 있어요:\n개발자나 연구자: AI 모델을 직접 개발하거나 테스트하는 사람들에게는 온디바이스 NPU가 유용할 수 있어요.\n프라이버시 중시: 모든 AI 작업을 로컬에서 처리하고 싶어서 클라우드 서비스를 신뢰하지 않는 사용자들에게는 AI PC가 좋은 선택일 수 있어요.\n얼리어답터: 새로운 기술을 가장 먼저 경험하고 싶은 분들이라면, 첫 세대 AI PC도 충분히 매력적일 수 있겠죠.\n특정 AI 앱 사용자: 코파일럿+나 어도비의 온디바이스 AI 기능을 적극적으로 활용하는 사용자라면 AI PC가 유용할 수 있어요.\n\n\n미래는 AI PC의 것일까요?  \n솔직히 AI PC는 분명 미래의 트렌드가 될 거예요. 업계 전문가들도 2025년부터 AI PC 시장이 본격적으로 성장할 것으로 예측하고 있고, 더 많은 앱과 서비스가 NPU를 활용하게 될 거예요. 그렇기 때문에 결국에는 대부분의 PC가 AI PC가 될 가능성이 높아요.\n하지만 지금 당장은... 음... 좀 지켜봐도 괜찮지 않을까요? 기술은 항상 발전하고, 첫 세대 제품은 항상 시행착오를 겪기 마련이니까요. 제 개인적인 생각으론, 대부분의 사용자들은 1-2년 정도 더 기다렸다가 AI PC 시장이 성숙해지고 관련 앱 생태계가 더 발전한 후에 구매해도 늦지 않을 것 같아요.\n여러분은 어떻게 생각하세요? 이미 AI PC를 구매하셨나요, 아니면 기다리고 계신가요? 댓글로 의견 공유해 주시면 좋겠어요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: AI PC와 일반 PC의 가장 큰 차이점은 무엇인가요?\nA: NPU(Neural Processing Unit)의 유무입니다.

Suno v4.5와 함께라면 누구나 자신만의 음악적 상상력을 현실로 만들 수 있어요. 복잡한 장비나 전문 지식 없이도, 그저 여러분의 아이디어를 글로 표현하는 것만으로 멋진 음악이 탄생합니다.\n저는 Suno v4.5를 써보고 정말 놀랐어요. 제 머릿속에서만 울리던 그 멜로디, 제가 느끼던 그 감정들이 실제 음악으로 표현된다는 게 얼마나 신기한지 몰라요. 지금 당장 여러분도 Suno에서 v4.5 노래를 만들어보세요. 더 많은 기능들이 곧 출시될 예정이니 귀 기울여 주세요!\nFAQ\nQ: Suno v4.5는 무료인가요?\nA: 기본 기능은 무료로 사용 가능하지만, 프리미엄 기능을 위한 Pro & Premier 구독 옵션이 있습니다.\nQ: 음악 전문가가 아니어도 사용할 수 있나요?\nA: 네! 음악적 배경 없이도 직관적으로 사용 가능합니다. 원하는 분위기나 장르를 설명하기만 하면 됩니다.\nQ: 만든 음악의 저작권은 누구에게 있나요?\nA: Suno로 만든 음악은 비상업적 용도로 자유롭게 사용 가능합니다. 상업적 이용에 관해서는 Suno의 라이선스 정책을 확인하세요.\nQ: 몇 분 길이의 음악까지 만들 수 있나요?\nA: v4.5에서는 최대 8분 길이의 곡을 만들 수 있습니다.\nQ: 외국어 노래도 만들 수 있나요?\nA: 네, 다양한 언어로 가사를 입력하면 해당 언어로 노래를 만들 수 있습니다.\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Suno v4.5는 무료인가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"기본 기능은 무료로 사용 가능하지만, 프리미엄 기능을 위한 Pro & Premier 구독 옵션이 있습니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"음악 전문가가 아니어도 사용할 수 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"네! 음악적 배경 없이도 직관적으로 사용 가능합니다. 원하는 분위기나 장르를 설명하기만 하면 됩니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"만든 음악의 저작권은 누구에게 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"Suno로 만든 음악은 비상업적 용도로 자유롭게 사용 가능합니다. 상업적 이용에 관해서는 Suno의 라이선스 정책을 확인하세요.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"몇 분 길이의 음악까지 만들 수 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"v4.5에서는 최대 8분 길이의 곡을 만들 수 있습니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"외국어 노래도 만들 수 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"네, 다양한 언어로 가사를 입력하면 해당 언어로 노래를 만들 수 있습니다.\"\n    }\n  }]\n}",

        "contentSnippet": "사람 대 사람 사이에서 가장 중요한 건 서로간의 '이득' 이라는 것을 책 한권을 통해 전달하는 것으로 읽혔다.\n이득 기반으로 인간 관계가 움직인다는 사상을 인정하고 좋아하기에 전체적인 내용을 많이 동의했다.\n내 기준에서 회사는 4단계의 계층이 있다고 본다.\n대표\nC레벨 혹은 임원\n중간 리더\n팀원\n이 중 이 책에서 언급되는 \"군주\"는 사실상 회사의 대표라고 볼 수 있는데, 대표에게 직언을 할 수 있는 위치인 C레벨 (혹은 임원)은 이 책의 여러 고사들에게서 배울 점이 많다.\n그 중에서도 아래 메세지들은 지금의 내 위치에서 생각해볼 것들이 많았다.\n\"군주에게 간언하고 설득하는 자는 군주가 자기를 사랑하는지, 미워하는지 살펴 본 후 설득해야 한다는 것을 알 수 있다\"\n\"누군가를 설득할 때에는 상대방이 수치심을 느끼거나 부끄러워하는 감정을 건드리지 말아야 한다\"\n\"일반적으로 군주들은 신임하지 않는 자가 간언하면 비방한다고 생각하고, 신임하는 사람이 간언하지 않으면 봉록만을 훔치는 자라고 생각하는 경향이 있다\"\n\"군주에게서 충분한 신임을 얻기 전까지는 간언을 조심해야하며, 신뢰를 얻은 후에는 간언을 계속 해야하며, 신뢰의 정도에 따라 간언의 수위를 조절해야하며, 간언을 전달할 때는 최대한 역린을 건드리지 않도록 주의하면서 전달해야한다\" 로 정리될 수 있다.\n이 내용은 군주에게 간언해야하는 위치의 사람들이 항상 생각해야할 것들이다.\n회사로 본다면 아마도 C레벨과 임원들이 해당될 것 같다.\n종종 회사에 합류하자마자 바로 어떠한 액션을 취하려고 강한 주장을 하거나 대표에게 직언을 하는 리더나 임원들의 이야기들을 들을때가 있다.\n그리고 그 리더는 대부분 얼마가지 않아 퇴사를 했다는 것도.\n상위 직급자와 나와의 신뢰 관계는 어느 정도이며, 이 정도에서는 어디까지의 이야기가 허용 가능한지 판단할 수 있는 시야를 갖고 있는 사람이 좋은 리더가 될 수 있다는 생각이 들었다.\n또 하나 중요한 점은 C레벨 혹은 중간 리더는 본인의 신뢰 자산을 기반으로 아직 충분한 신뢰 자산이 쌓이지 않은 팀원들의 건설적인 의견을 대표에게 잘 전달해야한다는 것이다.\n예전에 태호님이 작성하신 쿠팡의 통역가분들에 대한 이야기 를 보고나서, 이것이 조직의 중간 리더의 역할과 다를 바 없다고 생각이 들었다.\n“회사가 커지면 상하 위계 간은 물론이고 각 조직 간의 크고 작은 이해관계와 알력다툼이 만연하며 성장 속도가 늦어지는데, 어째서 쿠팡은 이렇게 되지 않았고 이를 최소화할 수 있었을까?”\n나중에 문득 깨달은 것이지만, 나는 바로 쿠팡의 통역사분들이 이를 가능하게 했다고 감히 생각한다.\n쿠팡은 한국 본사의 임원진부터 글로벌 오피스의 실무자까지 많은 외국인들과 함께 일한다.\n업무 시 공용어는 한국어보다는 영어다.\n모든 주요 문서는 영어로 작성되고 모든 주요 미팅에는 전담 통역사가 함께 들어와 실시간 통역을 지원한다.\n그런데 이분들의 실시간 통역이란 것이 단순히 영어를 한글로, 한글을 영어로 바꿔 말하는 게 다가 아니더라.\n쿠팡의 통역사분들은 수많은 미팅에 들어가고 문서를 검토하며 회사 전반과 각 조직의 가장 많은 정보와 컨텍스트를 갖고 있어 이것이 마법을 만들어낸다.\n예를 들어,\n누군가 오해를 살 수 있는 표현을 해도 -> 통역이 오해 없도록 명확한 용어로 바뀐다.\n누군가 잘못된 정보를 근거로 해도 -> 통역 시 가볍게 다시 물어 정정할 수 있도록 한다.\n누군가 조직 이기주의 등 편협한 소리를 해도 -> 통역이 톤앤매너를 조절해 건설적으로 이것이 논의될 수 있는 기회로 바꾼다.\n미팅이 같은 말을 반복하며 빙빙 돌고 있어도 -> 통역이 간파하고 원래의 주제에서 결론을 낼 수 있도록 넛지를 한다.\n누군가 너무 감정적이거나 화를 내도 -> 통역이 그 감정이 잠시 담길 작은 버퍼가 되어준다.\n등등등\n정말 수많은 부분에서 통역사분들의 역량이 발휘된다.\n굉장한 건 이것들이 미팅 안에서 절대 티가 나지 않는다는 것이다.\n통역사가 주인공이 되는 일은 없다.\n다만 그 미팅은 여러 함정을 무사히 넘기고 좋은 의사 결정을 이룬다.\n누군가 정말 잘하는 것들은 그대로 스며들어 당연한 것이 되지 잘한 티가 나지 않더라.\n팀원들은 아직까지 조직간 관계나 처세 등에 대해 익숙하지 않다.\n대표와의 신뢰 관계도 충분하지 않다.\n이런 상황에서 팀원 -> 대표로의 간언은 유효할 확률이 거의 없다.\n이때 중간 리더가 (쿠팡의 통역처럼) 팀원의 의견을 잘 해석하여 대표가 설득될 수 있는 수준으로 포장하여 전달해야하는 역할을 해야한다.\n중간 리더의 신뢰 자산은 그러라고 쌓는 것이다.\n물론 이 외에도 조직원들을 어떻게 대해야하는지에 대해서도 인사이트를 얻을 수 있었다.\n조직 내에서 해야할 일들에 대해서 \"이 일은 본인에게도 좋은 일이다\" 는 것으로 자연스럽게 귀결 될 수 있도록 전달하는 것이 참 중요하다.\n조직장으로서는 이 일을 개인을 위한 일 인것처럼 느껴지게 할 것인지를 고민해야하고,\n개인은 어떻게 하면 이 일이 나에게 도움이 되도록 해석할 것인가가 전체적인 삶의 만족도를 결정하게 되는 것 같다.\n책 속 문장\n한비자는 인간은 이해득실만을 따질 뿐 도덕성은 생각하지 않는다고 보았다.\n그는 이것을 부모가 낳은 아이가 아들일 경우와 딸일 경우 보여주는 행동의 차이로 설명했다.\n아들이나 딸 모두 부모의 품에서 나왔지만, 아들을 선호하는 것은 따지고 보면 부모 자신의 노후를 걱정한 데서 비롯된다는 것이다.\n또한 사람들의 이해관계는 늘 어긋난다.\n예컨대 군주와 신하가 생각하는 이익이 각기 다르며, 남편과 아내, 형과 아우 사이에도 이해는 서로 엇갈리기 마련이다.\n이 중에서도 특히 군주와 신하는 남남이 만나 각자의 이익을 추구하는 관계이므로 군주가 신하에게 충성만을 요구한다거나 도덕만으로 다스린다는 것은 어리석은 일이다.\n[옛날 미자하는 위나라 왕에게 총애를 받았다.\n위나라의 범에 왕의 수레를 몰래 타는 자에게는 발이 잘리는 형벌을 내리도록 하였다.\n미자하의 어머니가 병들었을 때 어떤 사람이 밤에 몰래 와서 미자하에게 알려주었다.\n그러자 미자하는 슬쩍 왕의 수레를 타고 나갔다.\n왕은 이 일을 듣고 그를 칭찬하며 말하였다.\n\"효자로구나. 어머지를 위하느라 발이 잘리는 벌도 잊었구나!\"\n다른 날 미자하는 왕과 함께 정원에서 노닐다가 복숭아를 따먹게 되었는데, 맛이 아주 달자 반쪽을 왕에게 주었다.\n왕이 말하였다.\n\"나를 사랑하는구나. 맛이 좋으니 과인을 잊지 않고 맛보게 하는구나\"\n세월이 흘러 미자하의 미모가 쇠하고 왕의 사랑도 식게 되었을 때 한번은 미자하가 왕에게 죄를 지었다.\n그러자 왕은 이렇게 말하였다.\n\"이놈은 옛날에 과인의 수레를 몰래 훔쳐 타기도 하고, 또 자기가 먹던 복숭아를 과인에게 먹으라고 내밀기도 하였다.\"\n미자하의 행동은 변함이 없었으나 전에는 칭찬을 받았지만 뒤에는 벌을 받은 까닭은 사랑이 미움으로 바뀌었기 때문이다.]\n...\n군주에게 간언하고 설득하는 자는 군주가 자기를 사랑하는지, 미워하는지 살펴 본 후 설득해야 한다는 것을 알 수 있다.\n...\n비단 왕뿐 아니라 사람에게도 저마다 역린이 있다.\n누군가를 설득할 때에는 상대방이 수치심을 느끼거나 부끄러워하는 감정을 건드리지 말아야 한다.\n아무리 논리적으로 설득할지라도 외면당할 수 있기 때문이다.\n결국 상대방의 마음을 잘 헤아려 나의 의도를 그에게 맞추려면 상대방의 역린을 읽어낼 수 있는 감수성이 필요하다.\n설득은 마음을 움직이는 일이므로 논리보다는 감성이 앞선다고 할 수 있다.\n노자는 통치술의 첫째로서, 통치가의 존재 그 자체를 부정하고 있다.\n앞에 나서서 설치는 자는 최상의 군주가 아니고 뒤에서 조용히 조종하는 자가 최상이라는 것이다.\n물론 그 존재 자체도 느끼지 못할 때 그것이 최상이다.\n일반적으로 군주들은 신임하지 않는 자가 간언하면 비방한다고 생각하고, 신임하는 사람이 간언하지 않으면 봉록만을 훔치는 자라고 생각하는 경향이 있다.\n그러므로 신하들은 충성스러운 간언을 할 분위기가 조성되지 않으면 침묵하게 된다.\n이러한 문제를 해결하고자 당 태종은 간언을 독려한다.\n\"사람이 자기 얼굴을 보려면 반드시 맑은 거울이 있어야 하고, 군주가 자기 허물을 알려면 반드시 충직한 신하에 의지해야 하오.\n군주가 만일 자신을 현인이나 성인이라고 여기는 착각에 빠져있고, 신하도 정확한 의견을 제시하여 바로잡지 않는다면, 이런 상황에서 위험과 실패를 면하는 것이 어찌 가능하겠소?\n군주가 국토와 사직을 버리면 신하 또한 자신의 집안을 보존할 수 없소.\n수양제는 잔인하고 포학했지만 신하가 입을 다문 채 아무 말도 하지 않았으므로 자기에게 어떤 허물이 있는지 듣지 못했소.\n결국 나라는 멸망했소.\n우세기 등의 대신 또한 오래지 않아 피살되었소.\n이것은 과거 오래전의 일이 아니오.\n대신들은 내가 백성들에게 불리한 일을 하는 것을 보게 되면, 반드시 거리낌 없이 직언을 하여 비판 해야 하오.\"\n한비자는 도성을 떠나 유람을 가는 것 또한 지극히 경계했다.\n군주가 궁궐을 비우고 외부로 떠나는 것은 결국 궁정의 긴장감을 무너뜨리게 되므로, 조직의 긴장도를 위해 군주는 유람할 시간이 없다는 것이다.\n아이가 어릴 때 부모의 양육이 소홀하게 되면, 그 자식은 성장하여 부모를 원망하게 된다.\n또 그 자식이 장년이 되었을 때 부모에 대한 효도를 망각하면, 그 부모는 자식을 책망하게 될 것이다.\n부자 사이는 가장 친밀한 사이임에도 책망하거나 원망한다는 것은 서로 상대가 자기를 위해서 일을 한다는 마음이 없었기 때문이다.\n아랫사람을 고용하여 씨앗을 뿌리거나 경작을 시킬 때, 주인이 집안 살림에서 과용을 하며 좋은 음식과 쫗은 옷을 주고 노동의 대가로 돈도 챙겨주는 것은 그 아랫사람을 배려하기 때문이 아니다 .\n그렇게 후하게 대해야만 깊이 땅을 팔 것이며, 잡초를 샅샅이 뽑으리라 생각하기 때문인 것이다.\n...\n결국 주인과 일하는 사람 양쪽 모두 자기 이익만을 생각하고 있는 것이다.\n그러므로 자기에게 이익이 되도록 일을 하면 적대적인 나라 사람과도 우호적으로 지낼 수 있고, 자기 이익을 떠나게 되면 부자지간도 서로가 원망하게 된다는 것이다.\n...\n남을 위해 죽도록 일하는 것이 아니라 자신의 이익과 목표를 위해 일한다고 생각하면 상대에 대한 평가도 어렵지 않으리라.\nps.\n여담이지만, 챕터별로 편차가 있지만, 챕터의 제목과 챕터의 전반부/후반부의 내용이 상이해서 생뚱 맞다는 느낌을 받았다.\n챕터의 첫번째 사례로 드는 고사는 제목과 잘 어울려서 챕터를 이해하는데 도움이 되었지만, 두번째, 세번째 고사는 사실 챕터에서 이야기하고자 하는 바와 어울리지 않을 때가 많아서 띠용한 적이 종종 있다.\n예를 들어 \"15. 만족을 모르면 근심도 떠나지 않는다\" 에서 2번째 고사는 새옹지마 사례다보니 '일희일비 하지 않는다' 라는 주제에선 어울리겠지만, '만족할 줄 알아야 한다'를 이야기해야하는 이 챕터에서는 전혀 어울리는 고사는 아니라고 생각했다.\n그 외에도 이런 사례가 많아서 책의 좋은 내용과 별개로 책에 대한 평가를 할 때 '절하' 되는 근거가 될 것 같다.",
