This release includes bug fixes, several documentation changes, and the removal of the x-gha binary caching provider for GitHub (alternatives are described below).\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,621 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n35 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n517 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n132 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,900 forks and 25,100 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.06.13 release)\nThe following notable changes were made in this release:\nDue to recent changes in GitHub Actions Cache’s API, the x-gha binary caching provider has been rendered obsolete. As a result, we had to remove it from vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1662). Instead, you can use one of the following methods to cache binaries in GitHub; we welcome any feedback from our users about how this experience could be improved in the future:\n\nUse GitHub Packages with NuGet, which uses vcpkg’s caching mechanism and preserves caching granularity per port. This is the method the vcpkg team recommends.\nUse actions/cache in your workflow to cache the installed directory. The downside of this method is that the whole installed tree gets cached as a single artifact, so single port updates invalidate all packages.\nFixed a bug causing permissions while using upkg to not be preserved (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1625).\nImproved diagnostics and bug fixes for vcpkg x-test-features command (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1649, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1650, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1663, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1676, thanks @autoantwort!).\nFixed an issue causing slow binary cache insertions in some Docker containers (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1659, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1669, thanks @Thomas1664, @dg0yt!).\nOther minor bug fixes and internal feature improvements (thanks @autoantwort, @dg0yt, @huangqinjin, @DewJunkie!).\nDocumentation changes\nThe vcpkg docs have moved to the MicrosoftDocs organization, under the URL https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs. The existing repo has fully migrated with no loss in functionality. Links to the old repo should redirect to the new one automatically. The experience on the Learn website remains the same.\nAdded documentation for the new commands format-feature-baseline and x-test-features (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#455).\nAdded documentation for vcpkg license-report command (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#491).\nUpdated Tutorial: Set up a vcpkg binary cache using GitHub Packages in a GitHub Actions workflow to clarify that mono is no longer pre-installed by default for GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#495).\nUpdated vcpkg in MSBuild projects article to add instructions about how to pass MSBuild properties to vcpkg builds (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#481).\nRemoved documentation references to GitHub Actions Cache and x-gha provider, de-indexed the associated tutorial, and added a removal notice on the reference page.\nOther minor documentation improvements (thanks @Alan Pope, @Ivan Sorokin, @shijunz, @Tiago Freitas, @Yan Romao!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\nTriplet\nPorts available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2406\n\n\nx64-windows\n2524\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2524\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2398\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2450\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1410\n\n\narm64-windows\n2122\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2102\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1377\n\n\nx64-osx\n2394\n\n\narm64-osx\n2321\n\n\nx64-linux\n2510\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1939\n\n\nx64-android\n1996\n\n\narm64-android\n1961\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ktor offers a lightweight, flexible approach to building web applications that differs from more opinionated all-in-one frameworks. While Ktor’s minimalist design might seem challenging at first, a little experience using our modules can go a long way towards building for scale.\nIn this article, I’ll show you some techniques for introducing modularity to your Ktor projects.\nWhy modularity matters\nOne of the reasons Ktor remains a popular choice for server-side development is the directness and transparency of its implementations. Without the need for meta-programming or a host of configuration files, you can write simple services constrained to just a few Kotlin source files and it’s always clear that you’re working with an HTTP server.\nThis approach is great for simple applications, but when growing projects, it is important to anticipate future needs and mitigate their impact. The best way to accomplish this is break up your application into small, isolated parts, so that you can replace relevant pieces of functionality without modifying the whole thing. In other words, in order to gracefully scale the complexity of our project, we introduce modularity.\nMost application frameworks include some first-class support for baking in modularity — usually by having some central registry for including bits of functionality. The Ktor server framework is no exception to this, and in the next section I’ll introduce the concept of application modules in Ktor.\nModules in Ktor\nTo start, let’s cover the basics.\n1. What is a Ktor module?\nTo put it simply, it’s one of these:\nfun Application.moduleName() {\n    // Add a little functionality\n}\nAnd with Ktor 3.2, you’ll also be able to use suspend functions as modules:\nsuspend fun Application.moduleName() {\n    // Add some functionality with coroutines!\n}\nEither way, a module is just an extension function for an Application that runs as the server starts.\nNow, you might be wondering…\n2. What is an Application?\nThis is the container that holds all the hooks for business logic that execute when a request is handled. For example, we can inject some logging at the start of our pipeline, or we can insert some logic for serializing objects in the response.\nWhen the server is restarted, the Application is created anew and all the Ktor modules are reapplied. This also happens after changes are made while running in development mode, with the environment and engine configuration remaining untouched.\n3. What can I do with Ktor modules?\nYou can reference modules directly from the context of the Application from an EmbeddedServer instance:\nfun main() {\n    embeddedServer(CIO, port = 8080, host = \"0.0.0.0\", module = Application::module)\n        .start(wait = true)\n}\n\nfun Application.module() {\n    routing {\n        get(\"/\") {\n            call.respond(\"Hello, World!\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nOr you can reference modules from your configuration file:\n# application.yaml\nktor:\n  application:\n    modules:\n      - com.example.ApplicationKt.module\nReferencing modules from our configuration allows us to change the behavior of our server during runtime. For example, we can include some stronger security features only in production, or include some debugging hooks for our test environments. To properly leverage this functionality, it’s best to split your modules up into smaller units.\nGranular modules provide greater flexibility, but can present a challenge when many of them rely on some specific piece of code. These common requirements can be duplicated across modules, or we can introduce dependencies between our modules by sharing this data through the Application instance.\nModules will often be related via dependencies, but there’s no obvious way to apply these connections.  In the next section, I’ll describe how to hook modules together.\nConnecting modules\nReviewing the signature of the module function, it is difficult to see how modules can relate to one another:\nfun Application.module(): Unit\nThere aren’t any arguments or return types, so how can the platform possibly piece them together?\n1. Use the stack\nThe simplest and most natural way to relate modules is by treating them exactly as you would any other function call:\nfun main() {\n    embeddedServer(CIO, port = 8080, host = \"0.0.0.0\") {\n        // Instantiate your dependency\n        val myService = MyService(property<MyServiceConfig>())\n        // Inject it into your modules as a parameter\n        routingModule(myService)\n        schedulingModule(myService)\n    }.start(wait = true)\n}\nThis approach can work well for applications of any size, with the sole caveat that our modules are now strongly coupled at compile time, so they’re no longer interchangeable at runtime.\nWhen working in a single repository, you’re unlikely to need interchangeable modules, but when scaling out to multiple repositories and teams, using them can be an asset for reducing coordination overhead. To get around this rigidity, we can consider removing inter-module references by passing dependencies through a common container.\n2. Application Attributes\nKtor includes a built-in container for passing references between modules and plugins. You can find it in the Application.attributes property, which is really just a Map<String, Any> that retains some extra type information.\nHere is an example to show how the attributes map can be used:\nval connectionFactoryKey = AttributeKey<ConnectionFactory>(\"ConnectionFactory\")\n\n// Declaring\nfun Application.database() {\n    attributes[connectionFactoryKey] = PostgresConnectionFactory()\n}\n\n// Resolving\nfun Application.service() {\n    val connectionFactory = attributes[connectionFactoryKey]\n\n    // Use the connection factory in our service\n}\nWith this method of connecting different modules, we create loose coupling by avoiding direct references between our modules. We can achieve this using parameterized attribute keys for sharing implementations through a common map. This qualifies our attributes property as a basic inversion of control (IoC) container.\nThis technique can be fairly versatile, but it has a few disadvantages:\nIt requires a shared “key” variable that lives outside the scope of our server.\nModules are now temporally coupled, i.e., they must be referenced in a specific order.\nThere is no tracking of what goes into or comes out of the map.\nEverything is manual, i.e., there is no support for reflection.\nThere is no way to manage the lifecycle of these services.\nIn summary, you can do quite a bit with a simple map of instances, but it falls short when working with larger projects.\n3. External libraries\nTo address some of these pain points, we can look at some popular Kotlin IoC libraries. In this article, I won’t go into the details of which library solves which problems, but there are plenty of options when working in Kotlin.\nHere are some examples of IoC libraries that allow sharing between modules in Ktor using a declarative approach:\nKodein\nAn open-source library developed by KodeinKoders to provide a simple declarative means for sharing instances.\n// Declaring\nfun Application.database() {\n    di {\n        bind<ConnectionFactory> {\n            singleton {\n                PostgresConnectionFactory()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Resolving\nfun Application.service() {\n    val connectionFactory by closestDI().instance<ConnectionFactory>()\n    // Use the connection factory in our service\n}\n\n\n\n\nKoin\nA popular and pragmatic open-source framework by Kotzilla that uses a fairly similar approach. \n// Declaring\nfun Application.database() {\n    koinModule {\n        singleOf<ConnectionFactory> {\n            PostgresConnectionFactory()\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Resolving\nfun Application.service() {\n    val connectionFactory by inject<ConnectionFactory>()\n    // Use the connection factory in our service\n}\n\n\n\n\nApart from these declarative, multi-platform libraries, there are also several libraries made for injecting classes using annotations and compiler plugins:\nKotlin-inject\nDagger\nAnvil\nMetro\nAt this point, you might feel a little overwhelmed with options. After all, when using all-in-one frameworks, everything you need is built in, and you don’t have to worry about choosing some external means for sharing code. This is why in our latest release, we’ve worked to resolve this mental overhead by introducing a new DI plugin for Ktor server applications.\nObligatory XKCD reference.\nKtor’s dependency injection\nThe goal of the new plugin is to simplify the management of inter-module dependencies. To facilitate this, we focused on improving the developer experience and introducing deep platform integration.\nWith the new plugin, there are a few options for sharing instances between your modules:\nThe plugin DSL\nFile configuration\nModule parameters\nHere are some examples of how each of these techniques work.\nPlugin DSL\nIf you’re accustomed to the libraries described above, the DSL will probably be most familiar to you.\nHere’s the same example from above using the Ktor DI plugin:\n// Declaring\nfun Application.database() {\n    dependencies {\n        provide<ConnectionFactory> { PostgresConnectionFactory() }\n    }\n}\n// Resolving\nsuspend fun Application.service() {\n    val connectionFactory: ConnectionFactory = dependencies.resolve()\n}\nWe also allow for declaring types from class references. This way, types are created automatically, and their constructor arguments will be populated from other declared types. Any of the class’s covariant types can also be resolved from the registry this way, so you don’t have to worry about the abstraction on the declaration side.\nHere’s how to declare your instances from class references:\nfun Application.database() {\n    dependencies {\n        provide(PostgresConnectionFactory::class)\n    }\n}\nNow, we’ll show how to use these references for changing functionality at runtime!\nFile configuration\nAs shown earlier in the article, you can modify the behavior of your server by swapping modules in your file configuration. The DI plugin accommodates a similar approach, but for targeting specific types.\nConsidering our last connection factory example using class references, we can now do the same from our configuration file:\n# application.yaml\nktor:\n  application:\n    dependencies:\n      - com.example.PostgresConnectionFactory\nYou can also reference functions that return the types you’re interested in:\nktor:\n  application:\n    dependencies:\n      - com.example.Postgres#createConnectionFactory\ndb:\n  url: postgres://localhost:3456\nWhere the actual function looks something like:\nfun createConnectionFactory(@Property(\"db.url\") url: String): ConnectionFactory {\n    return PostgresConnectionFactory(url)\n}\nAs you can see in the example function, properties from your configuration can now be imported directly as parameters. You can import basic types like String and Int, or you can import more complex data types marked with the @Serializable annotation.\nModule parameters\nNot only can you inject the parameters of instance-providing functions, but you can also inject the module functions themselves.\nFor any module, you can import parameters from:\nYour file configuration, using the @Property annotation.\nSpecial types, like Application, ApplicationEnvironment, or ApplicationConfig\nAny declared dependency.\nHere’s how our connection factory example looks:\nfun Application.service(connectionFactory: ConnectionFactory) {\n    // Use the connection factory in our service\n}\nThe platform will handle the injection of connectionFactory automatically, and it doesn’t matter what order you reference your modules in. The same injection works with dependencies referenced from your file configuration, so you can chain them together to construct more complex dependency trees.\nIt’s important to note that, since this injection relies on type reflection, it will only be available for the JVM.\nTesting with DI\nOne major advantage of decoupling your modules is that it simplifies testing.\nUsing the DI plugin in Ktor 3.2, you can mock out components with ease:\nfun `can fetch messages`() = testApplication {\n    // replace the production implementation with a mock\n    dependencies { \n        provide { MockConnectionFactory() }\n    }\n    // load modules from your default application.conf\n    configure()\n    \n    val messageList: List<Message> = client.get(\"/messages\").body()\n    assertEquals(listOf(expectedMessage), messageList)\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis works by providing an alternative conflict policy in the test application context, so initial dependencies are retained. All you need to remember is that your mocks should go in before your production modules.\nScaling with DI\nNow that we have a reliable way to share code between modules, we can easily start splitting our projects into small Gradle modules. Instead of keeping all of our server logic in a single project, we can isolate different integration points, providing the opportunity to use domain-centric architectures, like the hexagonal or clean.\nIf we continue with our previous example, we can consider excluding the postgres connection factory from our compilation classpath entirely.\nLet’s say we have a project structure like this:\ndb\n├─ core\n├─ postgres\n└─ mongo\n\nserver\n├─ core\n├─ admin\n└─ banking\nNow, we can share some common server modules under server/core and focus more strictly on domain logic in our smaller services.\nUnder server/banking, for example, our build.gradle.kts file would look like this:\nplugins {\n    id(\"io.ktor.plugin\") version \"3.2.0\"\n}\ndependencies {\n    implementation(\":server:core\")\n    implementation(\":db:core\")\n    runtimeOnly(\":db:postgres\")\n    runtimeOnly(\":db:mongo\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen we can defer choosing our storage implementation right up until our application is deployed and reads the configuration file.\nFor this, we simply edit application.yaml like so:\nktor:\n  application:\n    dependencies:\n      # Taken from modules db/*\n      - com.example.MockConnectionFactory\n      # - com.example.MongoConnectionFactory\n      # - com.example.PostgresConnectionFactory\n    modules:\n      # Taken from server/core\n      - com.example.Authentication.configureAuth\n      # My domain service\n      - com.example.Banking.configureBankRoutes\nSince the implementations are hidden from our compile classpath, we can avoid polluting our services with implementation details while introducing several options for how our application operates.\nWrapping up\nIn this article, we’ve covered the basics of working with modules in Ktor and how to leverage dependency injection tools for sharing code between them.\nTo summarize:\nKtor modules are replaceable extension functions for the Application class.\nModules can be used to manage complexity in a growing application.\nCode can be shared between modules indirectly via attributes or a DI library.\nKtor now includes a robust DI plugin out of the box.\nHere is an example of a project that uses the new tooling:\nhttps://github.com/ktorio/ktor-chat/\nIf you have any thoughts on any of the topics in this article, you can leave a comment here or find us in the official Kotlin Slack channel.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The new YouTrack 2025.2 release brings further design updates to make working on your projects easier. You also get a shared default dashboard and a growing set of useful apps. Here’s what’s new:\nProject overview pages have been redesigned to increase clarity, with clickable hierarchy paths to help you move between project contexts.\nNew project templates improved the project creation wizard for general task management needs, advanced project management, and marketing.\nA default dashboard for all users and external guests to use as a central hub for your organization.\nNew free apps can be found on JetBrains Marketplace to extend YouTrack’s functionality in various ways.\n\n\n\n\nRedesigned project page for all users\nNavigate to project information in one place\nProject overview pages now offer an advanced project-centric navigation, with all project information closer to the main YouTrack menu. Using the left-hand sidebar, you can access issues, articles, and boards related to the project. To return to the overview or switch to other project content, you can use the new project icon, which provides quick access to the sidebar.\nAdditionally, you can now create new tasks and articles directly within the selected project from the project overview page.\nSwitch between multiple projects\nWhen you are working within one project context but need to switch to another, you can now do so quickly from the project overview pages. A project drop-down list has been added to the clickable hierarchy paths, so you no longer need to return to the project list.\n\n\n\n\nImproved project configuration for administrators\nCreate projects using new project templates\nThe improved project creation wizard helps project administrators create projects more easily and now includes new templates tailored to specific team needs, in addition to the existing Helpdesk and Scrum or Kanban software development templates.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate for general task management needs\nThe Task Management template is ideal if you need a simplified way to track tasks. It enables any team to manage tasks by priority, state, assignee, and due date. You can work with the default setup, moving tasks between To do, In Progress, and Done states, or customize the project configuration to suit your work.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate for advanced project management\n​​For tracking various work types and managing more complex task states, the Project Management template can be selected. The default setup helps classify tasks by general types, such as Milestone, Task, or Subtask, which can be easily adjusted by project administrators. This template also comes pre-configured for time tracking, allowing users to log time spent and add estimations.\n\n\n\n\nTemplate for launching marketing activities\nThe new Marketing template is a starting point for setting up a project to track activities across various marketing functions. It allows marketers to classify their work, whether it’s a campaign, content creation, paid advertising, or something else. \nNext, they can fill in the task with additional details such as activity focus, channel, budget, performance metrics, etc. Many of these fields come with pre-filled values adjusted to marketing processes. For example, in the Focus field, users can select a goal ranging from Product Launch to Customer Retention, or add other custom values. If your Marketing team has their own unique processes, the template can be easily changed to suit them; for example, you can adjust it for use by the Digital Marketing team only.\nManage project settings more intuitively\nProject administrators can now manage project settings directly from the left-hand sidebar on the project overview pages. We’ve also made minor updates to the settings structure to make it more intuitive. You can now find the General Info settings in the page header for easier access.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure conditions for field values\nIn addition to conditional fields, administrators can now specify which values are displayed for a given field based on previously submitted task information. For example, let’s say a user selects Germany in the Country field when creating a task to organize a trip. You can configure the Location field to display only options in Germany. If USA is selected instead, only USA-based offices will appear, and so on. You can define conditions for multiple values of a single field, allowing for a more tailored task creation process.\n\n\n\n\nYouTrack’s new design becomes standard\nWe hope the new YouTrack look has become more familiar and comfortable for you over time. As it is now the standard interface, we will continue to improve it going forward. Please note that the option to switch back to the legacy menu is no longer available.\nNew functionality for dashboards\nDisplay information for all users on the default dashboard\nEvery YouTrack now includes a single default dashboard that is visible to all users in your organization (as well as external guests, provided that administrators have made YouTrack accessible to them in the settings). You can use the default dashboard as a central hub for your organization, displaying notes, reports, and other useful information on one page. Only global administrators have permission to edit the default dashboard, including renaming it or adding widgets. \n\n\n\n\nClone dashboards and articles\nCreating new dashboards and articles in YouTrack just got faster. Administrators (and users with access to the dashboard) can now clone an existing dashboard and tailor it to fit their personal, team, or customer needs. We’ve also added a Clone Article workflow that you can either attach to your projects as-is or customize as needed. For example, you can add a custom action that clones articles into a predefined project. Articles will be cloned automatically as drafts first and can be published anytime.\nNew apps on JetBrains Marketplace \nThe collection of free apps from our certified consulting partners and third-party providers is growing! Check out the new apps below. \nApps that expand your work on projects \nIssue Dependencies by Marcus Christensson for visualizing complex projects with graphs by displaying hierarchical dependencies of issue links.\n\n\n\n\nBetter Backlog by Adeptask simplifies development processes by helping to manage multiple sprints in one place. \n\n\n\n\nEmbedded Sites by J&J Ideenschmiede for embedding iframe-based websites as dashboard widgets or within Markdown content.\n\n\n\n\nApps for those who track time \nWorklog Controller by MSP helps you easily move logged time from one task to another and classify whether this time is billable or not.\n\n\n\n\nTime Tracker by SWNetwork adds a timer to tasks, allowing you to flexibly track and log the time you spend on your work.\n\n\n\n\nApps to make your work with specific tasks easier\nIssue Reminder by twenty20 sends email reminders for one-time alerts or recurring task actions for yourself and selected teams.\n\n\n\n\nCustom Printout by twenty20 for customizing and sharing task content by printing or exporting it as a PDF file.\n\n\n\n\nApps for better work with articles in Knowledge Base\nArticle Actions by twenty20 helps to copy and move articles along with their sub-articles.\n\n\n\n\nArticle Presentations by Adeptask presents article content as automatically formatted slideshows.\n\n\n\n\nOther improvements \nYouTrack Server can now be installed and upgraded via Docker images for both Linux and Windows.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In May, 145 JetBrains employees from across teams and time zones paused their regular work to participate in a 48-hour AI hackathon. \nWith support from Google Cloud, the participants built a total of 41 prototypes from scratch. Some were practical, others experimental, but all explored how AI could change how developers work.\nThe Google Cloud team ran technical sessions ahead of the event, covering the Gemini 2.5 model’s capabilities and tool integrations, as well as AI use cases for production. These sessions gave everyone a shared foundation and helped them get straight to building. Google also provided everyone with access to some experimental features across Gemini 2.5, Imagen3, and Veo2 models.\nSo what came out of it? Projects that tackled debugging, local context, user interfaces, and agent collaboration, and some of these ideas are already influencing product development. Here are the winning projects, along with a variety of others that stood out.\n\n\n\n    \n“For the second year in a row, we are delighted to host this awesome AI hackathon with super talented teams from JetBrains. This time around, I got to spend more time reviewing the completed projects – and oh boy, how much of a profound (and often almost emotional) effect it had on me. \n\r\n\r\nIt was amazing to see all the ambitious ideas the teams came up with, and how many of them had such a great fit in the ecosystems of both companies. And project presentations in the end? Some of them were legit examples of work of (AI-powered) art. \n\r\n\r\nOne could ask – where did the teams get so much time to code the project AND do an awesome Veo2-powered video presentation? The answer? Junie does the coding now.”\n\n            \nDmitriy Novakovskiy\n                                                                Principal Architect at Google Cloud\n                                    \nThe winning projects\nPopular vote\nKomponist, der\nThis tool for reducing repetitive prompting lets you insert predefined prompts into AI chats using buttons, hotkeys, and physical controllers like StreamDeck. You can also switch context profiles based on the task.\nAI agents\nRuntime-aware debugging agent for the JVM\nThis debugging agent helps you fix bugs by using execution traces, not just error messages. It works with a repair agent to test patches.

It saves pages locally, builds an embedded database, and supports natural language search and AI-assisted writing.\n\n\n\n    \n“It was impressive to witness the creativity of the teams, who developed innovative solutions that address a wide range of challenges. The hackathon kicked off with amazing energy, with the packed Google Cloud pre-enablement sessions and the teams’ eagerness to start the 48-hour sprint. \n\r\n\r\nIt was great to see that teams built their solutions incorporating the latest AI models into scalable and future-proof architectures. The final presentations were a highlight to remember; they were polished, humorous, and market-ready pitches. \n\r\n\r\nIt was particularly exciting to see the use of cutting-edge models like Veo2 for video and Lyria for audio generation, elevating their presentations to a whole new level.”\n\n            \nJelena Mijuskovic\n                                                                Customer Engineer for Data & AI at Google Cloud\n                                    \nGoogle Cloud’s honorable mentions\nThe following projects received special recognition from Google Cloud:\nSemantic search and structured summaries for PubTrends\nThis project upgraded pubtrends.info by providing semantic search and AI-generated summaries that connect research papers to relevant genes, datasets, and drugs using entity recognition.\nArtemy – AI deployment agent\nDesigned to simplify final deployment steps, this proof-of-concept agent automates setup, hosting, and domain configuration for new apps, websites, and bots.\nAI ad generator\nAimed at teams that need fast content generation across multiple channels, this tool turns short prompts into advertising content across formats and platforms.\n\n\n\n    \n“Wow, what an experience! Having been involved in a fair few hackathons, I was seriously impressed by how smoothly JetBrains ran their AI hackathon together with Google Cloud. \n\r\n\r\nGetting 145 people working together for days on end without a hitch is no easy feat, and honestly, everything just worked. But what really blew me away were the creative ideas – so diverse and clever! AI agents were a big theme, but teams went wild with everything from Tinder-swipe code review agents to deep-dive research agents that could practically walk you through the latest scientific papers. \n\r\n\r\nThe energy and innovation were just fantastic. And the vibe during the project presentations? Super cheerful and fun. It was just awesome to see everyone diving into AI and building such cool stuff!”\n\n            \nDiana Nanova\n                                                                Head of Customer Engineering Startups & Scaleups, EMEA North, at Google Cloud\n                                    \nWhat the future holds\nThis hackathon was not just an experiment. It created space for focused work and fast validation, and the ideas tested during those 48 hours are already shaping the future of AI at JetBrains. The time constraints helped teams focus on essential features, and participants said they appreciated the chance to work on something different and to collaborate with colleagues outside their usual teams.\nSeveral of the hackathon projects are already on their way to becoming actual features, as ideas from JetMem, JetBar, and the debugging agent are feeding into the development of our AI products. \nLearn more about JetBrains AI",

This issue is packed with fresh articles, helpful tips, and ideas to keep you inspired and motivated in your work.\nWe’re excited to feature Aicha Laafia, a Java engineer passionate about writing clean, green code and empowering women in tech. She’ll share how sustainable coding practices improve performance and reduce energy usage, and why mental well-being deserves just as much attention in our field.\nYou’ll also get a first look at the new Spring Debugger in IntelliJ IDEA – a powerful tool that reveals what’s really going on inside your Spring Boot app and helps you fix issues faster.\nAs always, we’ve gathered insightful notes on AI, upcoming events in July, and a few tech-adjacent thoughts to spark reflection and curiosity. Let’s dive in! 🚀\nFeatured Content \nAicha Laafia\n\nI’m Aicha Laafia, a Java software engineer with a love for coding, an interest in sustainability, and a commitment to empowering women in tech. I am a Women Techmakers and Girls Code ambassador, a member of the Moroccan Association of Computing Science, and part of the JetBrains Community Contributor program.\n \nI focus on creating software with minimal environmental impact while mentoring and supporting women in technology. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring delicious food, phone photography, and watching Formula 1.\n\nI’m excited to share what I’m passionate about: making Java apps not just clean and fast, but also greener and more efficient.\nClean code keeps you sane at 2am. Green code keeps your infrastructure costs sane at scale. It’s also more interesting! You have to squeeze performance out of what you have with no sloppy code hiding behind overkill hardware.\nOne of the biggest sources of wasted resources is start-up and warm-up time. Microservices and serverless functions spin up and down constantly. Every millisecond wasted during startup is wasted CPU cycles and energy.\nThis is why I would love to introduce one of JDK 24’s game-changing features, Ahead-of-Time Class Loading (JEP 483). It preloads and links classes before runtime, slashing startup and warm-up lag. Faster startup means microservices waste fewer CPU cycles, directly cutting energy use in cloud-native environments. I’ve covered this in detail in my article JDK 24: Faster, Smarter, and Ready for the Future.\nPair this with GraalVM 24.2’s native image capabilities – near-instant start-up and a low memory footprint – and you get serious energy savings and better performance.\nLooking ahead to JDK 25 and beyond, they’re adding some solid improvements for performance and efficiency:\nJEP 514 and JEP 515 bring better ergonomics and profiling for Ahead-of-Time compilation, making startup faster and CPU use smarter. I am super excited about JEP 521, which enhances Shenandoah GC with generational collection, cutting pause times and improving memory management.\nIf you want to dive deeper into practical green coding with Java, check out my Green Programming 101 article series. If video is more your thing, here’s my recent live talk at vJUG: How to Build Sustainable Java Applications.\nBefore I say goodbye, remember there’s one resource we often overlook: ourselves. Just like we monitor and optimize CPU and memory, it’s crucial to monitor your mental health and watch for burnout. It’s a hidden struggle many developers face.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We know how important security and encryption are to our customers—especially with enterprise standards rapidly evolving. That’s why we engage with our customers to understand what their security teams need and how we can help. Through those conversations, we developed our new advanced key management solution, designed to make team-based file encryption faster and more secure. This work also laid the foundation for the encryption approach we’re now bringing to Dropbox Dash, our universal search and knowledge management tool.\nTwo main priorities shaped how we built this solution. First, customers with especially sensitive or confidential data (e.g. those in finance or healthcare fields) told us they wanted their file data encrypted at rest—for example, when it’s not being moved or accessed—using keys unique to their team. This way, they could temporarily, or even permanently, disable all access to their team’s data if needed. Second, they wanted that encryption to be anchored in a hardware security module (HSM)—a physical device designed to securely generate, store, and manage encryption keys—providing stronger protections against unauthorized access. Together, these features help teams limit their security risks and respond more effectively to potential threats or breaches.\nIn this piece, we’ll walk through how we solved for scalable, secure team-level encryption without slowing down the Dropbox experience. We’ll share our decision-making process, the technical challenges we faced, and how the solution we built is influencing the way we think about security for AI tools like Dash.\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019c63112e617513c94_AtlasGrotesk-Medium-Web-vfl38XiTL.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 500;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019711b648fd1ccd24a_AtlasGrotesk-Regular-Web-vflk7bxjs.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 400;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n.xf-content-height {margin: 0;}\r\n#cta { font-family: AtlasGrotesk,sans-serif; font-size: .900rem; text-decoration: none; background: #f7f5f2; line-height: 1.69; box-sizing: border-box;}\r\n#cta-box { padding: 15px 20px 15px 20px; }\r\n#cta-hed {font-weight: 500;}\r\n#cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #1e1919; padding-left:20px;}\r\n#cta a:link, #cta a:visited  {text-decoration: none;}\r\n#cta p { margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; }\r\n\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta {background: #000;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-box {border: 1px solid; border-bottom: 0;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #f7f5f2;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark .button {background: #000;}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n    background-color: #1e1919;\r\n    color:  #f7f5f2;\r\n    height: 2.5rem;\r\n    padding: 10px 5px 10px 20px;\r\n    font-size: 1rem;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    line-height: 1.2;\r\n    transition: all .3s;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button:hover { background-color: #0061ff; }\r\n\r\nimg {vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px 1px 2px 0px;}\r\n\r\n.c17-plain-html {margin-bottom: 50px}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Dropbox Dash: Find anything.

Now with advanced search for video and images—plus generative AI capabilities across even more connected apps.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSee what's new →\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n    \n Identifying possible solutions\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWe kicked off this work by mapping out potential solutions. One obvious approach was to implement end-to-end encryption. It offers stronger support for encryption key management and access control—but it also brings tradeoffs, like added complexity for customer teams and reduced usability. For instance, with end-to-end encryption, you can’t search for files by their contents. End-to-end encryption is a powerful enterprise security solution, which is why we offer end-to-end encryption as a Dropbox feature for the teams that need it. But it makes more sense for some use cases than others, and we wanted to offer another solution for teams where it’s not the right fit.\nFor teams that don’t need full end-to-end encryption, there’s another solution: team-based key management. The standard here is to use something like AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to create a unique top-level key for each team, and then use that key to generate or decrypt individual data encryption keys for every file or record owned by the team. However, this approach doesn’t play well with a core part of the Dropbox experience: file sharing. To understand why, it helps to take a look at how Dropbox stores files and how we handle file copies across teams.\nHow Dropbox stores files\nWhen you upload a file to Dropbox, we break it into 4 MB chunks called “blocks.” Each block is encrypted, managed, and stored separately—sometimes even in different physical locations. And each block gets its own data encryption key; more on this later.\nWhat happens when you add files to Dropbox\nWhen someone shares a file or folder with you, you can choose to add it to your own Dropbox. This creates a new copy of the file that’s independent from the original, even though you started with a shared link. Now, imagine doing that in a world where we’ve implemented team-specific, top-level encryption keys. That copy has to be encrypted with the recipient team’s key, meaning Dropbox needs to store a whole new encrypted version of the file.\nWhy that’s tricky\nPutting this all together, if we followed the standard model—one top-level team key plus block encryption keys—then every time someone added a large file from another team to their Dropbox, we’d have to re-encrypt the entire thing. For big files or folders, this would be painfully slow. Even a slightly more efficient system that copies only the data encryption keys would still be prohibitively expensive and hard to scale in real time. And scale matters: Dropbox supports files up to 2 TB, which can mean upwards of half a million blocks per file. Nobody wants to wait for a million tiny re-encryption tasks just to copy a shared folder.\n\r\n\r\n    \n A three-tiered encryption scheme\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTo address team-based encryption key management and enable fast copies, we introduced a third tier of encryption keys to the standard model described above. To do this, we leveraged the fact that Dropbox files and folders are internally bucketed into namespaces. (You can think of a namespace as your root folder—a container that holds all your files and folders.) Every file and its associated data blocks belong to a namespace. This structure allows for an intermediate encryption tier at the namespace level, creating a three-tier key hierarchy:\nTeam encryption key (TEK): A top-level key unique to each team, generated and stored using AWS KMS within a hardware security module (HSM).\nNamespace encryption key (NEK): Each namespace has its own encryption key (NEK), which is generated using AWS KMS along with the team’s top-level encryption key (TEK). The NEK is then encrypted using the TEK and saved securely in persistent storage.\nBlock encryption key (BEK): Each block has a unique encryption key. It is stored encrypted at rest using the corresponding NEK.\nWhen a file is read, the system first retrieves the team’s top-level encryption key (TEK) from AWS KMS to decrypt the namespace encryption key (NEK). The NEK is then used to decrypt the block encryption keys (BEKs), which are used to decrypt the file’s data blocks. When writing a file, the process is reversed: New BEKs are encrypted with the NEK, and the NEK is encrypted with the TEK. This model adds only one metadata lookup and one extra encryption or decryption step per request.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01%20(1).png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01%20(1).png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"2820\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"51f956e1-49c5-4010-8d02-d0ec49fa274d:Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01 (1).png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01%20(1).png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01%20(1).png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"2820\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"51f956e1-49c5-4010-8d02-d0ec49fa274d:Security-Advanced-Key-Management-01 (1).png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nEncryption key operations on the read path\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nMaking copies fast\nThis setup really shines in one of our most common workflows: when someone adds a shared file or folder to their own Dropbox. Before, that kind of cross-team copy would require re-encrypting every block in the file. For large files—some with hundreds of thousands of blocks—that would take ages.\nWith this new model, Dropbox only needs to make a re-encrypted copy of the source namespace’s NEK to grant access. While it’s a huge performance win, it’s not a long-term solution—the recipient shouldn’t hold onto the original team’s NEK forever. So, behind the scenes, Dropbox runs background processes that slowly re-encrypt every block with the recipient’s keys. This way, we return to a clean, steady state without making users wait for all that processing upfront. It also turns out this approach aligns really well with our existing data locality architecture, which meant we could reuse a lot of the foundational setup.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Additional implementation considerations\n\r\n\r\n\n\nKey caching\nEven though we added a new encryption tier, overall system load is lower because we no longer need to hit the top-level key for every block. But we still need to avoid overwhelming AWS KMS. That’s why we cache NEKs in memory for a short period. Since file operations tend to happen in bursts—like uploading or syncing multiple files at once—this cache is very effective in cutting down on repeated KMS calls.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"826\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"71241255-dd58-4c25-8ab4-03eaa7335509:Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/akm/diagrams/Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1440\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"826\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"71241255-dd58-4c25-8ab4-03eaa7335509:Security-Advanced-Key-Management-02.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nHow often the system finds encryption keys (NEKs) quickly from memory\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nKey rotation\nDespite having more total keys than a two-tiered model, rotating encryption keys remains straightforward in our advanced key management setup. TEKs are stored in AWS KMS and can be rotated using native tools. Rotating an NEK does require re-encrypting all the BEKs tied to it, but instead of storing every old version of an NEK indefinitely—which would introduce real security risks—we re-encrypt the BEKs using the new NEK. The good news is that this is an offline process, so while it involves one re-encryption per block, it has no impact on user-facing performance. This setup supports strong compartmentalization and helps teams meet compliance and security requirements, even for keys stored in an HSM.\nChain of custody\nMemory bit flips are extremely rare, but at our scale, even rare hardware events can’t be ignored. A bit flip—when a single binary digit in memory unexpectedly changes from 0 to 1 or vice versa—can occur for any number of reasons, including hardware failures or even cosmic rays. If this happens while a key is being written to memory, it could silently corrupt the data or store a faulty key that later fails to decrypt the data. So while very unlikely, we still have to account for them because of the sheer volume of operations and keys we handle. \nTo protect against this, we built a chain-of-custody system for key operations. Whenever a key is used—whether in plaintext or encrypted form—it’s tagged with a cryptographic checksum. That checksum gets verified at every step. For example, if a plaintext NEK is used to encrypt a plaintext BEK, we generate a checksum of the new encrypted BEK. Then we decrypt that encrypted BEK, recompute the checksum, and compare it to the original. We also recompute and verify the checksum of the plaintext NEK. These extra steps make sure we never store corrupted versions of keys or encrypted data, even if something goes wrong halfway through an operation.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Key takeaways about our development\n\r\n\r\n\n\nBuilding advanced key management pushed us to rethink how we deliver both strong security and a smooth user experience at scale. One of the biggest takeaways? It’s not enough to just meet enterprise security and compliance standards. The system also has to be fast, reliable, and intuitive for both internal developers and our customers. From implementing a three-tier key hierarchy to optimizing key caching and rotation, this project helped us strike that balance between robust protection and ease of use.\nNow, we’re applying those same lessons as we bring advanced key management to Dash. We’re building encryption into Dash from the ground up with the same core principles: strong team-level isolation, efficient access, and customer-managed encryption controls. This means each team’s content—embeddings, interactions, and history—can be encrypted with its own unique keys. The result: more privacy and control for customers, and a foundation for safe, scalable AI experiences.\nOur three-tiered encryption scheme for advanced key management represents a leap forward in balancing robust security with practical usability. By introducing an intermediate layer of encryption keys (NEKs) into the standard two-tier model, Dropbox maintains fast file sharing and copying capabilities while still providing team-specific encryption. This approach not only meets the evolving security needs of enterprise customers but also showcases our commitment to innovation in the face of complex technical challenges. \nWith features like key caching, efficient key rotation, and a meticulous key chain of custody system, Dropbox has developed a solution that offers enhanced security without compromising on performance or user experience. And as cyber threats continue to evolve, such advancements in encryption key management will play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive data for businesses and organizations around the world.\nAcknowledgments: Stas Ilinskiy, Jon Lee, Joe Eichenhofer, Adam Briand, Candy Xiao, Vicky Xiao, Max Murin, Chung Yang, Taylor Hansen, Anuradha Agarwal, Hemant Thakre, Rajat Goel, Varun Bhardwaj, Bryan Mann, Kshitija Niyogi, and Varun Kuppili.\n~ ~ ~\nIf building innovative products, experiences, and infrastructure excites you, come build the future with us!

        "contentSnippet": "Aliexpress에서 구입한 AX900 WiFi USB 동글들을 성능 리뷰해봤다. AX900 wifi6 동글들은 대체로 블루투스 기능도 겸하고 있는데, 칩셋을 보면 AIC8800D80, RTL8851BU, RTL8831BU인 경우가 대부분이었다. \n알리익스프레스에서 구입해서 테스트한 AX900 제품은 총 10종류로 아래 사진과 같다. 내장 안테나 버전이 6개, 외장 안테나 버전이 4개이다. 상식적으로 외장 안테나가 달린 동글의 성능이더 좋을거라고 생각했는데, 테스트 결과는 의외로 외장 안테나가 있다고 성능이 더 좋은건 아니였다.\nAX900 WiFi6 USB dongles without external antenna\n\n\n \nAX900 WiFi6 USB dongles with external antenna\n\n\n참고로 이 테스트는 그냥 재미로 해본 것이다. 따라서 일부분 틀린 정보가 있을 수도 있음을 감안해야 한다.\n우선 칩셋에 따른 분류로 AIC8800D80 칩셋, 리얼텍 칩셋을 사용한 경우로 분류해서 살펴보도록 한다.\n \n1. AIC8800D80 칩셋\nAIC8800D80 칩셋을 사용한 제품들은 기본적으로 윈도에 드라이버가 없기 때문에 드라이버를 설치해야만 한다. 드라이버 설치는 희한하게도 USB를 꼽으면 생기는 작은 플래시 외장 디스크가 인식되고, 여기에 10MB 전후의 작은 드라이버 설치 파일이 들어있다. 이를 실행하면 드라이버가 설치된다. 설치 후 바로 인식되는 경우도 있지만 USB를 다시 뽑았다가 끼워야만 인식되기도 한다.\n해당 칩셋을 사용한 제품들은 블루투스 5.3 혹은 블루투스 5.4를 지원한다. 와이파이와 블루투스까지 지원되는 것은 꽤 괜찮은 장점인 것 같다.\n리눅스에서는 github에 있는 드라이버를 직접 빌드해야만 하는데, 커널 버전이 6.x 별로 약간 차이가 있어서 소스 코드를 좀 수정해야만 했다. 이에 대해서는 나중에 시간날 때 따로 쓰도록 하겠다.\nAIC8800D80은 AIC 반도체 회사라는 곳에서 만들었는데, 솔직히 처음 들어본 회사이다. 이번에 동글을 구매하면서 처음 알았다. 전통적으로 무선 칩셋은 Realtek, Mediatek, Intel, Qualcomm 정도가 제일 많이 들어본 회사이고, USB형태로는 거의 리얼텍과 미디어텍이 제일 많이 쓰였었다. AIC는 말레이시아에 있는 회사인거 같은데 솔직히 정보는 별로 없는 듯 하다.\n \n1.1. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #1\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n위 그림의 제품은 성능이 가장 잘 나왔다. 신호 강도도 가장 잘 잡았다. 다만 약간의 발열이 있다. 신호가 쎈만큼 발열이 나오는 것인지는 모르겠다. 이 제품은 연결되면 푸른색 LED가 켜지는 특징이 있다.\n \n1.2. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #2\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품도 성능이 가장 잘 나오는 제품 중에 하나였다. 다만 제품이 약간 길쭉했다. 휴대성 측면에서는 좀 안좋을 것 같기도 했다. 겉 면이 무광에 선이 그어져있는데 의외로 가공면이 고급스러운 느낌을 준다.\n \n1.3. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #3\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품도 신호도 잘 잡고 좋았다. 다만 사이즈가 압도적으로 크다. 거의 10cm미터에 육박하는 크기로 다른 제품의 2배 크기였다. 외장 안테나 때문인지 신호는 잘 잡았다. (그러나 앞서 내장 안테나는 쓰는 제품도 신호를 잘 잡는 것으로 봐서 안테나의 차이가 큰 장점은 아닌것 같기도 하다)\n \n1.4. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n해당 모양의 제품은 보통이었다. 이런 모양으로 조금씩 다른 형태가 있었는데 \n \n1.5. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이것도 그냥 보통이었다.\n \n1.6. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n양옆에 굴곡이 있어서 끼우거나 뽑을때 약간 편한 장점이 있지만, 그 외는 대체로 평범했다.\n \n1.7. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\n \nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n외장 안테나가 있지만 신호 강도는 노멀했다.\n \n1.8. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품은 안테나가 4개나 있지만 신호 강도는 그냥 노멀했다. 안테나가 혹시 가짜는 아닐까 하는 의심이 들어서 실제로 분해까지 해봤다. 결과적으로 멀쩡하게 다 연결되어있는데도 신호강호는 이상하게 약했다. 이건 진짜 아리송했다.\n \n \n2. 리얼텍 제품들\n리얼텍은 AX900 동글 제품들에 RTL8851BU 혹은 RTL8831BU 칩셋을 사용하는 경우가 많았다. 전체적으로 리얼텍 칩셋을 사용한 제품이 AIC칩셋 제품보다는 단가가 조금 더 비쌌다. 거의 2배정도의 가격을 형성했다.\n \n2.1. RTL8831BU - 좋은 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, RTL8831BU chipset\n\n\n이 제품은 Realtek RTL8831BU 칩셋을 사용했으며, 외장 안테나는 1개이다. 나사 방식이라 안테나는 분리가 가능하다. 이 제품도 USB연결시 외장 디스크가 인식되고 그 안에 드라이버가 들어있다. 블루투스 지원은 5.3 버전이고, 리눅스에서 지원은 github에서 받아서 빌드하면 된다. 특징으로는 wifi 동작 방식이 infra와 adhoc 둘다 가능하다는 점이다. 신호 강도고 괜찮고 꽤 쓸만했다.\nDERAPID도 브랜드가 있는 것 같긴 한데, 아마도 FENVI같이 여러 유통경로로 파는 회사가 아닌가 싶기도 하다.\n \n2.2. RTL8851BU - COMFAST 제품 - 별로\n\n\nCOMFAST는 브랜드가 있는 제품인데도 별로였다. 이 제품은 신호강도가 좀 약한 편이었다. 물론 신호강도가 약해도 와이파이 연결에는 문제가 없지만, 속도가 출렁이거나 느려질 수도 있는 단점이 있다. COMFAST 회사 제품은 가장 비쌌지만 가장 신호가 약했다.\n \n \n3. AXE5400 제품 - WIFI6e\nWIFI6e 제품도 있길래 하나 사서 별도로 테스트해봤는데, 그냥 soso했다. 속도는 잘 나오는 편이었다. 칩셋은 RTL8832CU를 사용했으며, 이 제품도 연결하면 USB 외장 디스크가 있고 그 안에 드라이버 설치 파일이 있었다.\nAXE5400 wifi USB dongle, RTL8832CU chipset\n\n\n \n \n4. 총평\n같은 칩셋을 사용해도 신호 강도는 매우 달랐고, 외장 안테나가 있다고 해서 무조건 신호가 쎈 것도 아니였다. 그리고 AIC8800D80 제품들도 의외로 쓸만했고, 리얼텍 제품들은 adhoc을 지원한다는 특징과 좀 더 비싼 가격이 특징이었다.\n \n \n히스토리\n2025.07.06 초고",

        "contentSnippet": "계속하던 것을 그만둔다는 건, 시작하는 것보다 더 어려운 결정을 요구할 때가 많다. ‘왜 그만둬야 할까?’라는 물음 앞에 서면 수많은 이유와 핑계가 머릿속에서 충돌하고, 그 과정에서 내면의 깊숙한 갈등과 마주하게 된다. 2018년부터 6년 동안 꾸준히 운영해온 기술 블로그 구독 서비스의 종료를 결심한 지금 역시 마찬가지다.\n　처음엔 단지 작은 불편을 해결하려던 단순한 프로젝트였지만, 어느 순간 수천 명의 사용자들의 아침에 만나는 루틴으로 자라 있었다. 사용자들이 보내는 감사의 메시지는 일상의 피로를 잊게 만들었고, 이 서비스가 세상 어딘가의 누군가에게 작게나마 변화를 주고 있다는 사실은 내 마음을 계속 움직이게 했다. 하지만 그 이면에서는, 늘어나는 책임과 운영의 부담 그리고 빠르게 변화하는 기술 환경 속에서 이 서비스의 존재 이유를 끊임없이 자문해야 하는 상황이 펼쳐지고 있었다.\n　그 고민의 시간은 몇 년간 이어졌다. 오픈소스로 남겨둘 수도 있었고, 다른 이의 손에 넘길 수도 있었으며, 최소한의 기능만 남겨 놓고 유지하는 선택도 있었다. 그러나 결국, 더는 내 마음이 닿지 않는 곳에서 무책임하게 살아 숨 쉬는 서비스를 바라볼 자신이 없었다. 깔끔하게 정리하고 떠나는 것이, 이 서비스에 대한 마지막 애정의 표현이자 책임이라는 생각이 들었다.\n　이 글은 그 6년간의 여정을 천천히 되돌아보며 써 내려간 기록이다. 시작의 설렘에서부터 성장의 기쁨과 아픔, 기술적 도전에서 얻은 배움, 그리고 ‘끝’이라는 쉽지 않은 결정까지. 이 이야기가 비슷한 고민 앞에 선 누군가에게 작은 위안과 용기가 되고, 새롭게 토이프로젝트를 시작하려는 사람에게 현실적인 안내가 되기를 진심으로 바란다. 무언가를 끝낸다는 건 실패가 아니라, 또 다른 출발을 위한 가장 정직한 준비다. 때로는 멈출 줄 아는 용기가 있어야, 새로운 길을 마주할 힘도 생긴다.\n토이프로젝트 관련 글\n개발 후기 1부\n개발 후기 2부\n개발 후기 3부\n벌써 2년\n시작\n　‘글 쓰는 개발자가 되자!‘는 생각이 머릿속을 가득 채우던 시절이 있었다. 단지 좋은 개발자가 되는 것뿐만 아니라, 내가 아는 것을 공유하고 나누며 기술 생태계에 작게나마 기여하며 영향력 있는 사람이 되고 싶다는 열망이었다. 그래서 시작한 기술 블로그는 어느새 개발자로서의 정체성 일부가 되었고, 조금씩 늘어나는 방문자 수는 내게 큰 보람을 주었다. 그러나 글을 쓰고 나서 늘 아쉬움이 남았다. 정성껏 작성한 글이 많은 사람들에게 닿았으면 좋겠다는 바람도 있었지만, 한편으로는 다른 개발자들이 작성한 좋은 글들을 여기저기 분산된 채로 찾아다녀야 하는 불편함이 마음에 걸렸다. 이러한 단순하고도 순수한 마음에서 출발한 아이디어 하나를 떠올렸다. “매일 아침, 어제 하루 동안 올라온 기술 블로그 글들을 자동으로 수집해서 이메일로 보내주면 어떨까?” 하루를 시작하며 좋은 글을 읽는 습관이 개발자로서 성장하는 데 큰 힘이 되었기에, 이 서비스가 나와 같은 고민을 가진 많은 개발자들에게도 도움이 될 거라 믿었다. 처음에는 단순한 아이디어였지만, 실제로 구현하기 위해서는 생각보다 많은 기술적 도전이 필요했다.\n\n          \n      첫 발송! 그때는 도메인도 없었어서 무료 도메인을 사용했었다.\n      \n　가볍게 무료로 운영할 방법을 고민하면서 Heroku에서 시작했으나, 제한된 자원과 운영방식의 문제로 Raspberry Pi를 거쳐야 했다. 그 과정에서 소규모 서버 운영에 대한 여러 시행착오를 겪었지만, 이것조차도 즐거운 경험이었다. 그러던 중 서버 개발자였던 나에게 한줄기 빛처럼 찾아온 것이 AWS 프리티어였다. AWS는 무료로 일정 기간 서버 인프라를 제공해줬고, 덕분에 부담 없이 조금 더 안정적인 환경을 구축할 수 있었다.

그런데 이번에 제미나이의 'Gem'에 'Canvas' 기능까지 더해지면서 AI 활용이 정말 한 단계 업그레이드된 것 같아요! 오늘은 제가 직접 경험해본 이 두 기능의 시너지 효과에 대해 솔직하게 이야기해볼까 해요.&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

data-ke-size=\"size16\">일단 'Gem'부터 알아봐야겠죠? 구글 제미나이에서 '젬(Gem)'은 사용자가 특정 목적에 맞게 직접 설정할 수 있는 맞춤형 AI 비서를 의미합니다. 음, 쉽게 말해서 내가 원하는 대로 학습시키고 길들일 수 있는 나만의 AI 친구라고 생각하면 돼요! 보석을 의미하는 'Gem'이라는 이름처럼, 정말 나만을 위한 특별하고 가치 있는 AI를 만들 수 있다는 개념이 담겨 있는 거죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 블로그 포스팅을 자주 하다 보니, 항상 글의 톤앤매너나 특정 형식을 유지하는 게 고민이었어요. 그런데 '블로그 포스팅 전문가' Gem을 만들어두고 평소 쓰는 말투나 자주 다루는 주제 등을 미리 설정해뒀더니, 세상에! 이후에 글 쓸 때마다 너무 편하더라고요. 매번 같은 지시를 반복할 필요 없이 원하는 스타일의 초안이 뚝딱 나오는 게 진짜 신기했어요. ✨</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px;

'Canvas'는 또 뭐죠?&nbsp;</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이번에 Gem에서도 지원되기 시작한 'Canvas'는 정말 놀라운 기능이에요. 구글 제미나이에 새롭게 추가된 '캔버스(Canvas)'는 AI와 실시간으로 협업하며 아이디어를 구체화하고 발전시킬 수 있는 대화형 작업 공간이에요. 저는 처음엔 그냥 그림 그리는 캔버스 같은 건가 했는데, 그게 아니더라고요! 단순한 채팅을 넘어서 문서 작성, 코드 개발, 데이터 시각화까지 가능한 만능 도구였어요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\"

작업 과정</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">1) <b>개요 및 목차 생성:</b> Gem이 제 지침에 맞춰 강의 개요와 5개 목차 초안을 바로 만들어줬어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">2) <b>세부 내용 확장:</b> 각 목차별로 \"이 목차에 대한 구체적인 내용을 500자 내외로 풀어서 써줘\"라고 요청했고, Canvas에서 실시간으로 내용이 추가되었죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">3) <b>시각화 아이디어 도출:</b> \"이 강의 내용 중 핵심 통계를 시각화할 차트 아이디어를 HTML/CSS 코드로 보여줘\"라고 하니, 간단한 코드와 함께 예시 디자인까지 보여주더라고요!</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #333; margin: 15px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>최종

느꼈어요. 마치 저만의 AI 어시스턴트 팀이 생긴 것 같은 기분이었죠. 아이디어 구상부터 초안 작성, 세부 내용 보강, 심지어 간단한 시각화 코드까지 한 번에 처리할 수 있으니, 제미나이 어드밴스드(Gemini Advanced) 구독이 아깝지 않더라고요. 물론 이 기능은 현재 유료 구독 모델 및 비즈니스/엔터프라이즈 사용자에게 주로 제공되고 있어요. 일반 사용자에게도 더 많은 기능이 풀리길 기대해봅니다!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size:

바로 AI만의 독특한 장점들 때문입니다. AI는 복잡한 재무제표나 기업 정보를 이해하기 쉽게 요약해주고, 여러 정보를 종합적으로 분석해줍니다. 특히 증권사 리포트처럼 전문적인 자료를 초보자도 이해할 수 있는 쉬운 언어로 정리해주어, 상당한 시간과 전문 지식이 필요한 작업을 간소화해주는 효과가 있죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">초보자가 가장 어려워하는 차트 분석에서는 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 복잡한 보조지표들을 하나씩 설명하며 현재 상황의 의미를 알려줍니다. 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 종합 분석해 단기와 중장기 관점을 모두 제시하고, \"골든크로스 발생, 특정 가격대 지지\" 등 구체적인 포인트를 안내해 차트 보는 법을 배우는 교육적 효과도 제공한다고 해요. 나아가 투자 성향에 따라 적극적/보수적 전략을 나누어 제안하고, 구체적인 진입가격, 손절선, 목표가까지 제시해 실전에서 바로 활용할 수 있는 실용적인 도움을 주기도 합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  알아두세요!</b><br />AI는 100페이지짜리 기업 보고서를 몇 초 만에 요약해주는 등 정보 분석의 효율성을 극대화합니다. 이는 개인이 감당하기 어려운 정보의 양을 빠르게 처리하여 투자 의사결정을 돕는 데 큰 강점이에요.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>AI 분석 결과의 변동성, 어떻게 이해할까?  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">여기서 한 가지 중요한 점이 있어요. 바로 같은 차트와 문서를 분석해도 매번 결과가 달라질 수 있다는 점입니다. 저도 처음에 좀 당황스러웠는데, 이건 AI의 특성 때문이라고 이해할 수 있어요. AI는 확률적으로 답변을 생성하기 때문에, 같은 질문이라도 조금씩 다른 관점에서 접근할 수 있답니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">생각해보세요. 같은 차트와 기업 보고서를 여러 명의 증권 전문가들에게 보여줘도 각자 다른 분석 결과를 내놓잖아요? 이는 각자가 중요하게 생각하는 지표가 다르고, 시장을 바라보는 관점이 다르기 때문이에요. AI도 마찬가지로 때로는 기술적 분석에 더 무게를 두고, 때로는 펀더멘탈에 더 집중하며, 때로는 리스크 요인을 더 강조할 수 있기에 결과가 달라지는 거죠. 이런 특성을 이해하고 활용한다면, 오히려 다양한 관점에서 종목을 분석해볼 수 있는 장점이 될 수도 있어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 이유 때문에, 제가 만든 젬 지침에는 항상 아래와 같은 면책조항을 반드시 추가할 것을 권장드려요. 투자는 결국 본인의 판단과 책임하에 이루어져야 하니까요!</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #333; margin: 0 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>면책조항: AI 분석 결과 활용 시 주의사항  </b></h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0 0 15px 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">AI 분석 결과는 정보 제공 목적으로만 활용되어야 합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">투자 결정은 전적으로 사용자 본인의 판단과 책임 하에 이루어져야 합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">AI는 최신 실시간 정보를 즉시 반영하지 못할 수 있으며, 시장의 정성적 요소는 분석에 한계가 있습니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">투자를 진행하기 전에 반드시 해당 기업의 최신 공시, 뉴스, 그리고 전문가의 추가 의견을 직접 확인하시기 바랍니다.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>효율적인 AI 주식 분석, 이렇게 준비하세요!  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI를 활용한 주식 분석의 핵심은 바로 '양질의 데이터'를 제공하는 것입니다. 저는 여러분이 이 젬 지침을 최대한 효과적으로 활용할 수 있도록, 필요한 자료를 어떻게 준비해야 하는지 알려드릴게요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">먼저 네이버 증권에 접속하신 다음, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">리서치 섹션</span>으로 이동하세요. 여기서 종목분석 섹션의 '더보기'를 클릭하고 원하는 종목을 검색한 후, 가장 최근에 나온 리포트 PDF를 다운로드해 주시면 됩니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그 다음은 차트예요. 네이버 증권에서 해당 종목을 검색하고 정보 페이지로 이동한 뒤, '차트' 탭을 선택합니다. 여기서 정말 중요한 건 바로 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">보조지표를 제대로 설정하는 것</span>인데요, 다음 6가지 지표를 꼭 추가해주셔야 합니다.</p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0 0 15px 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>거래량:</b> 주가 변동의 신뢰도를 확인하는 기본 지표입니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>볼린저 밴드:</b> 주가의 과열/과매도 구간을 판단하는 데 유용해요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>이동평균선:</b> 추세의 방향성과 지지/저항 역할을 확인하는 데 필수적이죠.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>MACD (Moving Average Convergence &amp; Divergence):</b> 단기 및 장기 추세의 변화 시점을 포착하는 데 효과적입니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</b> 14일 기준으로 과매수/과매도 상태를 판단하는 지표예요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>DMI (Directional Movement Index):</b> 상승/하락 모멘텀의 강도를 측정하는 데 사용됩니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 6가지 지표를 사용하는 이유는 각각이 서로 다른 관점에서 주가를 분석하기 때문이에요. 거래량은 주가 움직임의 '진정성'을, 볼린저 밴드와 RSI는 단기 과열 여부를, MACD는 추세 전환점을, 이동평균은 중장기 방향성을, DMI는 트렌드의 강도를 알려줍니다. 이 모든 정보가 종합되어야 보다 정확한 매매 타이밍을 잡을 수 있답니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">보조지표 설정이 끝나면 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 각각 적당히 확대해서 보기 좋게 만드신 다음, 인쇄 기능을 이용해서 이미지 파일을 만들어주세요. 총 3개의 차트 이미지가 필요하며, 제미나이가 이해하기 쉽도록 파일명도 '일봉', '주봉', '월봉'으로 해주시면 더 좋습니다. 이제 준비가 끝났습니다! 젬을 실행하고 PDF 파일과 3개의 차트 이미지를 모두 업로드하고 실행(엔터)하시면 됩니다. 이때 리서치 자료 외에 중요한 뉴스와 같은 더 많은 정보를 함께 제공하셔도 좋다는 점 참고하세요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>AI 기반 주식 분석의 실제 활용: '주식전문블로거' 젬  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 직접 개발한 두 번째 젬인 '주식전문블로거'는 여러분이 제공한 기업 정보 PDF와 일봉 차트를 분석하여, 마치 전문 블로거가 쓴 것 같은 완성도 높은 블로그 포스팅을 생성해줍니다. 이 젬 역시 첫 번째 젬과 동일하게 사용자 입력 정보를 등록하며, 차트의 경우 일봉 차트만 등록하시면 됩니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 젬이 만들어주는 결과물은 정말 매력적이에요. 먼저 독자의 관심을 끌 수 있는 블로그 제목부터 시작해서 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">SEO에 최적화된 HTML 형식의 기사</span>를 만들어줍니다. 특히 인상적인 부분은 투자 전략 섹션이에요.

        "contentSnippet": "AI와 함께 스마트한 주식 투자를! 복잡한 증권사 리포트와 차트 분석, 이제 AI가 빠르고 정확하게 도와드립니다. 이 글을 통해 AI 기반 주식 분석의 모든 것을 파헤치고, 여러분의 투자 성공 확률을 높이는 비법을 공개합니다!\n\n\n \n혹시 주식 투자 하시면서 방대한 정보의 바다에서 길을 잃었던 경험 있으신가요? 수십 페이지짜리 증권사 리포트를 읽다가 지쳐버리거나, 복잡한 차트 앞에서 멍하니 서 있었던 적은요? 제가 솔직히 말해서 그랬거든요. 그런데 말이죠, 이제는 그럴 필요가 없어졌어요! AI가 이 모든 과정을 혁신적으로 바꿔놓고 있답니다. 오늘 우리는 증권사 리포트와 주식 차트를 AI가 어떻게 분석하고, 여러분의 투자 의사결정에 얼마나 큰 도움을 줄 수 있는지 알아볼 거예요. 진짜 놀라운 변화가 찾아왔다는 걸 느끼실 겁니다!\n \n주식 정보 검색, 왜 AI가 대세일까?  \n최근 미국의 웹 조사 전문업체 시밀러웹의 발표에 따르면, 챗GPT 사용자의 뉴스 관련 검색이 작년 1월 대비 무려 212%나 급증했다고 해요. 여기서 가장 눈에 띄는 부분은, 검색되는 뉴스 카테고리 중 주식과 금융 관련 정보가 각각 33%, 21%로 절반 이상을 차지한다는 점입니다.\n이 통계는 단순히 뉴스를 찾는 것을 넘어, \"이 뉴스가 주가에 어떤 영향을 줄까?\", \"차트에서 어떤 신호가 나타나는 걸까?\"처럼 보다 심층적인 분석을 AI에게 요구하는 투자자들이 늘고 있다는 의미예요. 아직 대부분의 AI는 단편적인 정보 제공에 그치지만, 투자자들은 이미 AI의 잠재력을 보고 있는 거죠.\n  알아두세요!\nAI는 펀더멘탈 분석부터 기술적 분석, 맞춤 전략 제안까지 주식 투자에 필요한 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 도와줄 수 있습니다.\n \n구글 제미나이가 주식 분석에 특히 유리한 이유  \n이런 상황에서 구글의 제미나이가 주식 정보 분석에 더 유리할 수 있다는 점을 간과할 수 없어요. 왜냐하면 제미나이는 구글이 20년 넘게 축적해온 금융 데이터 처리 노하우와 검색 알고리즘의 정보 검증 시스템을 그대로 활용할 수 있기 때문이죠. 특히 정확성이 생명인 주식 정보에서는 Google Finance를 통해 쌓아온 금융 데이터 해석 경험이 정말 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.\n게다가 제미나이 2.5의 강력한 멀티모달 기능은 일봉, 주봉, 월봉 차트 이미지를 직접 분석할 때 빛을 발합니다. 복잡한 차트에서 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 다양한 보조지표들을 정확하게 인식하고 분석하는 능력이 뛰어나다고 하니, 개인 투자자들에게는 엄청난 기회가 아닐까요? 심지어 이 모든 기능을 무료로도 충분히 사용할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적이에요.\nAI 주식 분석, 얼마나 정확할까?\n구분\n설명\nAI 강점\n인간 전문가 강점\n\n\n\n\n정보 해석\n방대한 데이터 요약 및 분석\n속도, 대규모 데이터 처리\n직관, 비정형 정보 해석\n\n\n차트 분석\n보조지표 해석 및 추세 파악\n객관적인 지표 분석\n패턴 인식, 미묘한 변화 감지\n\n\n전략 수립\n투자 성향별 맞춤 전략\n일관된 논리, 빠른 시뮬레이션\n시장 심리, 경험적 판단\n\n\n최신 정보 반영\n업로드된 자료 기반 분석\n제공된 정보 내에서는 완벽\n실시간 뉴스, 공시 파악\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nAI 분석은 업로드된 자료를 기반으로 하기에 최신 뉴스나 공시 정보가 즉시 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 또, 차트 이미지 화질이 좋지 않으면 분석 정확도가 떨어질 수 있으니, 항상 고화질 이미지를 사용해야 합니다.\n \nAI 주식 분석, 활용법과 한계점 깊이 보기  ‍ ‍ \n그럼에도 불구하고 왜 많은 사람들이 AI를 활용해서 주식 정보를 찾으려 할까요? 바로 AI만의 독특한 장점들 때문입니다. AI는 복잡한 재무제표나 기업 정보를 이해하기 쉽게 요약해주고, 여러 정보를 종합적으로 분석해줍니다. 특히 증권사 리포트처럼 전문적인 자료를 초보자도 이해할 수 있는 쉬운 언어로 정리해주어, 상당한 시간과 전문 지식이 필요한 작업을 간소화해주는 효과가 있죠.\n초보자가 가장 어려워하는 차트 분석에서는 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 복잡한 보조지표들을 하나씩 설명하며 현재 상황의 의미를 알려줍니다. 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 종합 분석해 단기와 중장기 관점을 모두 제시하고, \"골든크로스 발생, 특정 가격대 지지\" 등 구체적인 포인트를 안내해 차트 보는 법을 배우는 교육적 효과도 제공한다고 해요. 나아가 투자 성향에 따라 적극적/보수적 전략을 나누어 제안하고, 구체적인 진입가격, 손절선, 목표가까지 제시해 실전에서 바로 활용할 수 있는 실용적인 도움을 주기도 합니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI는 100페이지짜리 기업 보고서를 몇 초 만에 요약해주는 등 정보 분석의 효율성을 극대화합니다. 이는 개인이 감당하기 어려운 정보의 양을 빠르게 처리하여 투자 의사결정을 돕는 데 큰 강점이에요.\n \nAI 분석 결과의 변동성, 어떻게 이해할까?  \n여기서 한 가지 중요한 점이 있어요. 바로 같은 차트와 문서를 분석해도 매번 결과가 달라질 수 있다는 점입니다. 저도 처음에 좀 당황스러웠는데, 이건 AI의 특성 때문이라고 이해할 수 있어요. AI는 확률적으로 답변을 생성하기 때문에, 같은 질문이라도 조금씩 다른 관점에서 접근할 수 있답니다.\n생각해보세요. 같은 차트와 기업 보고서를 여러 명의 증권 전문가들에게 보여줘도 각자 다른 분석 결과를 내놓잖아요? 이는 각자가 중요하게 생각하는 지표가 다르고, 시장을 바라보는 관점이 다르기 때문이에요. AI도 마찬가지로 때로는 기술적 분석에 더 무게를 두고, 때로는 펀더멘탈에 더 집중하며, 때로는 리스크 요인을 더 강조할 수 있기에 결과가 달라지는 거죠. 이런 특성을 이해하고 활용한다면, 오히려 다양한 관점에서 종목을 분석해볼 수 있는 장점이 될 수도 있어요.\n이런 이유 때문에, 제가 만든 젬 지침에는 항상 아래와 같은 면책조항을 반드시 추가할 것을 권장드려요. 투자는 결국 본인의 판단과 책임하에 이루어져야 하니까요!\n면책조항: AI 분석 결과 활용 시 주의사항  \nAI 분석 결과는 정보 제공 목적으로만 활용되어야 합니다.\n투자 결정은 전적으로 사용자 본인의 판단과 책임 하에 이루어져야 합니다.\nAI는 최신 실시간 정보를 즉시 반영하지 못할 수 있으며, 시장의 정성적 요소는 분석에 한계가 있습니다.\n투자를 진행하기 전에 반드시 해당 기업의 최신 공시, 뉴스, 그리고 전문가의 추가 의견을 직접 확인하시기 바랍니다.\n \n효율적인 AI 주식 분석, 이렇게 준비하세요!  \nAI를 활용한 주식 분석의 핵심은 바로 '양질의 데이터'를 제공하는 것입니다. 저는 여러분이 이 젬 지침을 최대한 효과적으로 활용할 수 있도록, 필요한 자료를 어떻게 준비해야 하는지 알려드릴게요.\n먼저 네이버 증권에 접속하신 다음, 리서치 섹션으로 이동하세요. 여기서 종목분석 섹션의 '더보기'를 클릭하고 원하는 종목을 검색한 후, 가장 최근에 나온 리포트 PDF를 다운로드해 주시면 됩니다.\n그 다음은 차트예요. 네이버 증권에서 해당 종목을 검색하고 정보 페이지로 이동한 뒤, '차트' 탭을 선택합니다. 여기서 정말 중요한 건 바로 보조지표를 제대로 설정하는 것인데요, 다음 6가지 지표를 꼭 추가해주셔야 합니다.\n거래량: 주가 변동의 신뢰도를 확인하는 기본 지표입니다.\n볼린저 밴드: 주가의 과열/과매도 구간을 판단하는 데 유용해요.\n이동평균선: 추세의 방향성과 지지/저항 역할을 확인하는 데 필수적이죠.\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence & Divergence): 단기 및 장기 추세의 변화 시점을 포착하는 데 효과적입니다.\nRSI (Relative Strength Index): 14일 기준으로 과매수/과매도 상태를 판단하는 지표예요.\nDMI (Directional Movement Index): 상승/하락 모멘텀의 강도를 측정하는 데 사용됩니다.\n이 6가지 지표를 사용하는 이유는 각각이 서로 다른 관점에서 주가를 분석하기 때문이에요. 거래량은 주가 움직임의 '진정성'을, 볼린저 밴드와 RSI는 단기 과열 여부를, MACD는 추세 전환점을, 이동평균은 중장기 방향성을, DMI는 트렌드의 강도를 알려줍니다. 이 모든 정보가 종합되어야 보다 정확한 매매 타이밍을 잡을 수 있답니다.\n보조지표 설정이 끝나면 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 각각 적당히 확대해서 보기 좋게 만드신 다음, 인쇄 기능을 이용해서 이미지 파일을 만들어주세요. 총 3개의 차트 이미지가 필요하며, 제미나이가 이해하기 쉽도록 파일명도 '일봉', '주봉', '월봉'으로 해주시면 더 좋습니다. 이제 준비가 끝났습니다! 젬을 실행하고 PDF 파일과 3개의 차트 이미지를 모두 업로드하고 실행(엔터)하시면 됩니다. 이때 리서치 자료 외에 중요한 뉴스와 같은 더 많은 정보를 함께 제공하셔도 좋다는 점 참고하세요.\n \nAI 기반 주식 분석의 실제 활용: '주식전문블로거' 젬  \n제가 직접 개발한 두 번째 젬인 '주식전문블로거'는 여러분이 제공한 기업 정보 PDF와 일봉 차트를 분석하여, 마치 전문 블로거가 쓴 것 같은 완성도 높은 블로그 포스팅을 생성해줍니다. 이 젬 역시 첫 번째 젬과 동일하게 사용자 입력 정보를 등록하며, 차트의 경우 일봉 차트만 등록하시면 됩니다.\n이 젬이 만들어주는 결과물은 정말 매력적이에요. 먼저 독자의 관심을 끌 수 있는 블로그 제목부터 시작해서 SEO에 최적화된 HTML 형식의 기사를 만들어줍니다. 특히 인상적인 부분은 투자 전략 섹션이에요.

현대 사회에서 스마트폰은 단순한 소통 도구를 넘어, 우리 삶의 중심에서 개인 비서 역할을 톡톡히 하고 있습니다. 그리고 그 핵심에는 바로 '인공지능 어시스턴트'가 자리 잡고 있죠. 그런데 시중에 워낙 다양한 AI 어시스턴트들이 많다 보니, 어떤 것을 선택해야 할지 고민이 되실 거예요. 그래서 제가 직접 안드로이드 기반의 대표적인 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트, 즉 Bixby, ChatGPT, Perplexity, 그리고 Gemini를 심층적으로 사용해보며 각자의 장단점을 분석해봤습니다. 과연 어떤 어시스턴트가 당신의 일상에 진정한 '내 사람'이 될 수 있을까요?  </p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>Bixby: 삼성 기기 사용자만을 위한 맞춤형 조력자  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">삼성 갤럭시 스마트폰에 기본적으로 탑재되어 있는 Bixby는 종종 그 잠재력을 간과하기 쉽습니다. 저 또한 처음에는 단순한 음성 명령 기능 정도로만 여겼죠. 하지만 직접 시간을 투자하여 사용해보니 예상보다 훨씬 강력한 기기 통합 능력을 지녔다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제 Galaxy A72에서 테스트했을 때, 설정 변경, 앱 실행, SmartThings 기기 제어 등 스마트폰 시스템 전반과의 연동성이 매우 뛰어났습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  주목할 만한 기능!</b><br />\"Hi Bixby\"와 같은 호출어(wake word)를 통해 핸즈프리로 실행할 수 있다는 점은 일상생활 속에서 상당한 편리함을 제공합니다. 예를 들어, \"야간 카메라 모드 열어줘\"라고 말하면 해당 카메라 앱을 즉시 실행하고, 심지어 장노출 촬영 설정까지 안내해주는 등 실질적인 작업 수행을 돕는 능력이 탁월했습니다.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그러나 삼성 앱 생태계를 벗어난 영역에서는 그 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 복잡한 정보 질의나 개방형 대화에서는 다른 범용 AI 어시스턴트들에 비해 다소 약한 모습을 보였습니다. 여전히 '명령 중심'의 인공지능이라는 점에서, 유연한 대화를 통한 정보 탐색보다는 특정 기능 실행에 최적화되어 있다고 할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>⚠️ Bixby 사용 시 유의점!</b><br />Bixby는 삼성 기기 및 SmartThings 생태계에 깊이 연동되어 있어 이 외의 사용 환경에서는 기능이 제한적일 수 있습니다.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>ChatGPT: 언어 지능은 최강, 그러나 손이 가는 AI  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">ChatGPT는 명확하게 말해, 스마트폰 기기 제어보다는 언어 이해 및 생성 능력에 특화된 어시스턴트입니다. 복잡한 질문에도 맥락을 정확히 파악하여 답변하고, 후속 질문에도 능수능란하게 대응하는 모습은 가히 독보적입니다. 창의적인 아이디어 구상, 글쓰기 보조, 긴 텍스트 요약 등 언어 기반 작업에서는 최강의 능력을 보여줍니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">하지만 스마트폰 운영체제(OS)와의 연동성 측면에서는 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 호출어(wake word)가 없기 때문에 음성만으로는 어시스턴트를 실행할 수 없으며, 수동으로 앱을 열어야 하는 번거로움이 있습니다. 또한, Wi-Fi 끄기나 일정 확인과 같은 OS와 직접 연동된 스마트폰 기능은 ChatGPT가 직접 제어하기 어렵습니다. 예를 들어, \"Wi-Fi 꺼줘\"라고 명령하면, 실제로 Wi-Fi를 끄는 대신 그 방법을 설명해주는 식입니다. 음성으로 전달받은 결과도 대부분 ChatGPT 앱 내부에서만 확인할 수 있어, 다른 어시스턴트들처럼 '즉각적으로 화면에 반응하는' 경험을 기대하긴 어렵습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>Perplexity: 숨겨진 멀티태스킹 강자, 지능형 정보 탐색가  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Perplexity는 ChatGPT만큼 대중적인 인지도는 없지만, 실제 사용 환경에서는 놀라운 경쟁력을 보여주었습니다. 가장 인상 깊었던 점은 질문의 흐름을 자연스럽게 이어가며 처리하는 능력과 다양한 앱과의 연동성이었습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"주변 맛집 추천해줘\"라고 질문한 뒤, \"그럼 도보 거리에 있는 곳으로만 좁혀줘\", 그리고 마지막으로 \"선택한 식당 정보를 친구에게 문자로 보내줘\"와 같은 다단계 요청을 중간에 끊김 없이 유연하게 처리해냈습니다. 이는 Perplexity가 단순한 질문-답변 AI를 넘어, 사용자의 복합적인 작업 지시를 이해하고 해결해주는 진정한 '도우미'로서의 강점을 보여주는 사례입니다. 또한, Uber 실행 시 목적지를 자동으로 입력해주거나, Spotify를 실행하여 사용자가 원하는 음악을 재생하는 등 앱 연동 기능도 매우 원활하게 작동했습니다. 이처럼 Perplexity는 단순 검색을 넘어 실생활 자동화에 한 발 더 다가선 느낌이었습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

        "contentSnippet": "스마트폰 인공지능 비서, 당신의 일상을 혁신할 최적의 파트너는? 대표 안드로이드 AI 어시스턴트 4종의 면밀한 비교를 통해, 당신에게 딱 맞는 디지털 동반자를 찾아드립니다.\n스마트폰 AI 어시스턴트 심층 분석\n\n\n \n  현대 사회에서 스마트폰은 단순한 소통 도구를 넘어, 우리 삶의 중심에서 개인 비서 역할을 톡톡히 하고 있습니다. 그리고 그 핵심에는 바로 '인공지능 어시스턴트'가 자리 잡고 있죠. 그런데 시중에 워낙 다양한 AI 어시스턴트들이 많다 보니, 어떤 것을 선택해야 할지 고민이 되실 거예요. 그래서 제가 직접 안드로이드 기반의 대표적인 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트, 즉 Bixby, ChatGPT, Perplexity, 그리고 Gemini를 심층적으로 사용해보며 각자의 장단점을 분석해봤습니다. 과연 어떤 어시스턴트가 당신의 일상에 진정한 '내 사람'이 될 수 있을까요?  \n \nBixby: 삼성 기기 사용자만을 위한 맞춤형 조력자  \n삼성 갤럭시 스마트폰에 기본적으로 탑재되어 있는 Bixby는 종종 그 잠재력을 간과하기 쉽습니다. 저 또한 처음에는 단순한 음성 명령 기능 정도로만 여겼죠. 하지만 직접 시간을 투자하여 사용해보니 예상보다 훨씬 강력한 기기 통합 능력을 지녔다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제 Galaxy A72에서 테스트했을 때, 설정 변경, 앱 실행, SmartThings 기기 제어 등 스마트폰 시스템 전반과의 연동성이 매우 뛰어났습니다.\n  주목할 만한 기능!\n\"Hi Bixby\"와 같은 호출어(wake word)를 통해 핸즈프리로 실행할 수 있다는 점은 일상생활 속에서 상당한 편리함을 제공합니다. 예를 들어, \"야간 카메라 모드 열어줘\"라고 말하면 해당 카메라 앱을 즉시 실행하고, 심지어 장노출 촬영 설정까지 안내해주는 등 실질적인 작업 수행을 돕는 능력이 탁월했습니다.\n \n그러나 삼성 앱 생태계를 벗어난 영역에서는 그 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 복잡한 정보 질의나 개방형 대화에서는 다른 범용 AI 어시스턴트들에 비해 다소 약한 모습을 보였습니다. 여전히 '명령 중심'의 인공지능이라는 점에서, 유연한 대화를 통한 정보 탐색보다는 특정 기능 실행에 최적화되어 있다고 할 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ Bixby 사용 시 유의점!\nBixby는 삼성 기기 및 SmartThings 생태계에 깊이 연동되어 있어 이 외의 사용 환경에서는 기능이 제한적일 수 있습니다.\n \nChatGPT: 언어 지능은 최강, 그러나 손이 가는 AI  \nChatGPT는 명확하게 말해, 스마트폰 기기 제어보다는 언어 이해 및 생성 능력에 특화된 어시스턴트입니다. 복잡한 질문에도 맥락을 정확히 파악하여 답변하고, 후속 질문에도 능수능란하게 대응하는 모습은 가히 독보적입니다. 창의적인 아이디어 구상, 글쓰기 보조, 긴 텍스트 요약 등 언어 기반 작업에서는 최강의 능력을 보여줍니다.\n하지만 스마트폰 운영체제(OS)와의 연동성 측면에서는 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 호출어(wake word)가 없기 때문에 음성만으로는 어시스턴트를 실행할 수 없으며, 수동으로 앱을 열어야 하는 번거로움이 있습니다. 또한, Wi-Fi 끄기나 일정 확인과 같은 OS와 직접 연동된 스마트폰 기능은 ChatGPT가 직접 제어하기 어렵습니다. 예를 들어, \"Wi-Fi 꺼줘\"라고 명령하면, 실제로 Wi-Fi를 끄는 대신 그 방법을 설명해주는 식입니다. 음성으로 전달받은 결과도 대부분 ChatGPT 앱 내부에서만 확인할 수 있어, 다른 어시스턴트들처럼 '즉각적으로 화면에 반응하는' 경험을 기대하긴 어렵습니다.\n✅ 강점: 대화형 지능, 창의적 사고, 텍스트 작업에 압도적인 강점.\n❌ 약점: 음성 호출 미지원, 스마트폰 기본 기능 제어의 어려움, 제한적인 앱 연동성.\n \nPerplexity: 숨겨진 멀티태스킹 강자, 지능형 정보 탐색가  \nPerplexity는 ChatGPT만큼 대중적인 인지도는 없지만, 실제 사용 환경에서는 놀라운 경쟁력을 보여주었습니다. 가장 인상 깊었던 점은 질문의 흐름을 자연스럽게 이어가며 처리하는 능력과 다양한 앱과의 연동성이었습니다.\n예를 들어, \"주변 맛집 추천해줘\"라고 질문한 뒤, \"그럼 도보 거리에 있는 곳으로만 좁혀줘\", 그리고 마지막으로 \"선택한 식당 정보를 친구에게 문자로 보내줘\"와 같은 다단계 요청을 중간에 끊김 없이 유연하게 처리해냈습니다. 이는 Perplexity가 단순한 질문-답변 AI를 넘어, 사용자의 복합적인 작업 지시를 이해하고 해결해주는 진정한 '도우미'로서의 강점을 보여주는 사례입니다. 또한, Uber 실행 시 목적지를 자동으로 입력해주거나, Spotify를 실행하여 사용자가 원하는 음악을 재생하는 등 앱 연동 기능도 매우 원활하게 작동했습니다. 이처럼 Perplexity는 단순 검색을 넘어 실생활 자동화에 한 발 더 다가선 느낌이었습니다.\n✅ 강점: 복합적인 다단계 작업 처리 능력, 뛰어난 앱 연동성, 심층적인 정보 탐색 및 요약 능력.\n❌ 약점: 음성 호출어 미지원으로 인한 핸즈프리 제어 불가, 상대적으로 낮은 대중적 인지도로 인한 추가 기능 확장성 미지수.\n \nGemini: 구글 생태계의 핵심, 가장 균형 잡힌 차세대 비서  \nGoogle Assistant의 진화형인 Gemini는 제가 체험한 어시스턴트 중 가장 균형 잡힌 성능을 보여주었습니다. 기존 \"Hey Google\"이라는 호출어가 그대로 유지되어 핸즈프리 사용이 가능했으며, Gmail, Google Keep, Google Calendar 등 구글 서비스 전반과의 통합이 매우 뛰어났습니다.\n예를 들어, \"Nathan이 보낸 이메일 보여줘\"라고 요청하면 해당 이메일의 핵심 내용을 요약하여 홈 화면에 바로 표시해주는 등, 구글 앱과의 긴밀한 연동이 돋보였습니다. 또한, 음성으로 쇼핑 목록을 요청하면 Google Keep에 자동으로 항목들을 정리해주는 기능은 실질적인 활용도 면에서 매우 강력했습니다. 이러한 연동성과 자동화 기능은 일상생활의 효율성을 크게 높여주었습니다.\n✅ 강점: 음성 호출어 사용 가능, 구글 앱 및 서비스와의 완벽하고 깊은 연동, 자연어 처리 능력 향상, 전반적으로 균형 잡힌 기능 제공.\n❌ 약점: 간헐적으로 응답 속도 저하 현상 발생, 모든 요청에 대한 완벽한 이해 부족 (발전 중).\n \n총평: 당신의 AI 어시스턴트, 누구를 선택하시겠습니까?  \n이번 비교 체험을 통해 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트가 각기 다른 강점과 지향점을 가지고 있다는 것을 명확히 알 수 있었습니다. 결국 최적의 선택은 사용자의 주된 목적과 스마트폰 활용 방식에 따라 달라질 것입니다. 아래 표를 통해 당신의 AI 어시스턴트 선택에 도움이 되는 기준을 제시해 드립니다.\n사용 목적\n추천 어시스턴트\n\n\n\n\n삼성 기기와의 깊은 통합 및 제어\nBixby\n\n\n창의적 글쓰기, 정보 요약, 심층 대화\nChatGPT\n\n\n복합적인 다단계 작업 처리, 다양한 앱 연동 자동화\nPerplexity\n\n\n전반적인 일상 지원 및 구글 서비스와의 완벽한 연동\nGemini\n\n\n\n개인적인 최종 선택은 Gemini였습니다. 완벽하다고는 할 수 없지만, 가장 다양한 상황에서 안정적인 성능을 보여주었으며, 제가 이미 깊이 사용하고 있는 구글 서비스들과의 자연스러운 연동성은 실제 생활에서의 활용도를 압도적으로 높여주었기 때문입니다.\n \n마무리하며: 나의 일상을 책임질 디지털 동료  \n이제 AI 어시스턴트는 단순한 음성 명령 처리 도구를 넘어, 사용자의 일상에 깊이 관여하며 삶의 질을 높여주는 '디지털 동료'로 진화하고 있습니다. 중요한 것은 '가장 똑똑한 AI'를 쫓기보다는, '나의 생활 방식과 습관에 가장 잘 들어맞는 AI'를 발견하는 것이겠죠.\n당신의 스마트폰 어시스턴트, 과연 누구와 함께 스마트한 미래를 만들어갈 준비가 되셨나요?

[palera1n](https://palera.in/), unc0ver 등이 대표적인 예입니다. 특히, 일부 웹사이트에서는 별도의 PC 없이도 iPhone에서 직접 탈옥할 수 있는 도구를 제공하며, 이를 이용해 많은 일반 사용자들도 손쉽게 탈옥을 시도할 수 있습니다. **탈옥한 iPhone에서는 트윅(Tweak)이나 모드 앱(Modified App)을 아무런 제약 없이 자유롭게 설치할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak01.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://palera.in/) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n### 게임 앱의 피해 사례\r\r\n![Jailbreak_02.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak02.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' </span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n이렇게 탈옥한 iOS 환경에서 최근 피해가 지속적으로 발생하는 분야는 바로 모바일 게임입니다. 과거에는 특정 사용자의 단독적인 해킹으로 피해가 크지 않았지만, 최근에는 조직적이고 상업적으로 특정 게임을 타깃으로 해커들이 게임 앱을 해킹하고 변조하여 이를 배포하는 사례가 많아지고 있습니다. 대표적으로 iOS 모드 앱 배포 사이트인 [iOSGods.com](iOSGods.com)과 같은 사이트들이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_03.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak03.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: iOSGods.com) </span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n하지만 공개된 사이트에서 배포되던 것과 달리 최근에는 텔레그램 등의 단체 대화방에서 은밀하게 거래가 이루어지기도 합니다. 때문에 개발사에서는 일일이 iOS 모드 앱 대응이 쉽지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 손쉽게 모드 앱을 설치하여 일부 유저가 게임 내에서 어뷰징을 하면 그 수가 적을지라도 게임사에게는 치명적인 피해를 입히게 됩니다. 게이머들이 게임을 하는 목적은 경쟁에서 승리하는 것인 경우가 많습니다. 하지만 어뷰징을 통해 노력 없이 한 번에 성과를 획득하는 일이 생기고 일부 유료 콘텐츠를 정당한 지불 없이 이용하기도 합니다. 이렇게 되면 유저들은 정당하게 엄청난 시간과 노력, 그리고 돈을 들여 게임을 할 가치를 못 느끼게 되고, 결국 게임 내 결제를 중단하거나 게임에서 이탈하게 되며, 이는 게임사의 매출 하락으로 이어집니다. 게임의 매출은 1~3%의 소수 유저들이 만들어 내기 때문입니다. 실제로 저희 NHN AppGuard의 한 조사에 따르면 대형 게임 해킹 사건 이후 매출이 하락했다는 결과가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_04.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak04.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n결과적으로 게임사의 매출과 앱 서비스에 대한 고객의 신뢰가 하락하게 되는 것입니다.\r\r\n자세한 내용은 [NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16｜사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z | 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!](https://youtu.be/zGg1I7YePfE?si=eDcnKRoHErt0UzxC) 영상에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 3. iOS 탈옥의 역사와 동작 원리\r\r\n### JailbreakMe (iOS 1.x ~ 4.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_05.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak05.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JailbreakMe) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n**JailbreakMe**는 Safari 웹 브라우저를 이용해 탈옥하는 방식으로, 사용자가 특정 웹사이트를 방문하는 것만으로도 탈옥이 가능했습니다. 이는 PDF 렌더링 엔진의 보안 취약점을 이용한 것으로, 사용자 입장에서 가장 간편한 탈옥 방법이었습니다. \r\r\n그러나 Apple이 보안 패치를 적용하면서 더 이상 사용이 불가능해졌습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Redsn0w & Greenpois0n (iOS 4.x ~ 5.x)\r\r\n이 시기의 탈옥은 USB를 통해 기기를 컴퓨터에 연결한 뒤, 전용 탈옥 프로그램을 실행하는 방식으로 이루어졌습니다. **Redsn0w**와 **Greenpois0n**은 각각 다른 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행하였으며, tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 해제됨) 및 untethered(영구 탈옥) 방식으로 나뉘었습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Evasi0n (iOS 6.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_06.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak06.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://evasi0n.com/) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n**Evasi0n**은 iOS 6에서 사용된 탈옥 도구로, USB 연결을 통해 시스템의 여러 취약점을 연쇄적으로 이용하여 완전한 탈옥을 가능하게 했습니다. 당시 매우 높은 안정성과 호환성을 제공하여 널리 사용되었습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Pangu & TaiG (iOS 7.x ~ 9.x)\r\r\n**Pangu**와 **TaiG**는 중국 해커 그룹이 개발한 탈옥 도구로, iOS 7 이후 보안이 강화된 환경에서도 탈옥을 가능하게 했습니다. 특히, TaiG는 iOS 8에서 Apple이 취약점을 보완한 패치를 우회하는 새로운 기법을 도입하여 탈옥을 성공시켰습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Yalu (iOS 10.x)\r\r\n**Yalu**는 iOS 10에서 사용된 탈옥 도구로, 개발자인 Luca Todesco가 만든 것으로 유명합니다. 그러나 이 탈옥은 semi-untethered 방식이어서 기기를 재부팅하면 탈옥이 해제되며, 다시 실행하려면 특정 앱을 실행해야 했습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### unc0ver & Electra (iOS 11.x ~ 14.x)\r\r\n**unc0ver**와 **Electra**는 최근까지 사용되는 탈옥 도구로, 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행합니다. 특히 unc0ver는 안정성이 높아 많은 사용자들이 선호하였으며, 탈옥 후에도 시스템 기능을 최대한 유지할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### checkra1n (iOS 12.x ~ 14.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_07.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak07.png)\r\r\n <center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://checkra.in/) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n**checkra1n**은 기존의 탈옥과 달리, checkm8이라는 하드웨어 부트롬(bootrom) 취약점을 이용한 영구 탈옥 방식입니다. \r\r\n이로 인해 iOS 버전에 상관없이 특정 기기에서는 항상 탈옥이 가능하지만, 반대로 Apple이 소프트웨어 패치를 통해 막을 수 없는 특성을 가집니다. 다만, checkra1n은 semi-tethered 방식으로, 재부팅 후에는 다시 탈옥 프로세스를 수행해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n최근에는 Apple이 보안 강화를 지속하면서 탈옥이 점점 어려워지고 있으며, 대부분의 탈옥이 semi-tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 풀림) 형태로 제공되고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 4. 탈옥한 iOS 장치의 보안 취약점\r\r\n탈옥한 iOS 장치는 Apple이 제공하는 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하기 때문에 여러 가지 보안 취약점에 노출됩니다. 다음은 탈옥한 iOS가 갖는 주요 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **시스템 보안 우회**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple의 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하여 시스템 파일을 수정할 수 있습니다. 이는 악성 코드나 바이러스가 시스템에 침투하기 쉽게 만듭니다.\r\r\n* **앱 간 데이터 접근**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 앱 간의 데이터 접근이 가능해져, 민감한 정보가 유출될 위험이 높아집니다.\r\r\n* **루트 권한 노출**: 탈옥한 기기는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있어, 시스템 파일을 자유롭게 변경할 수 있습니다. 이는 해커가 기기를 완전히 제어할 수 있는 가능성을 열어줍니다.\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹 위험**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 악성 소프트웨어나 해킹 툴이 쉽게 설치될 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있습니다.\r\r\n* **보안 업데이트 차단**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple로부터 자동 업데이트를 받지 못하게 되어 중요한 보안 패치와 기능 업데이트를 놓칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n특히, 탈옥한 장치에는 앱의 실행을 제한하는 보안 프로세스가 없기 때문에, 악성 소프트웨어가 시스템에 침투할 가능성이 높아집니다. 이러한 위험은 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 보호하는 데 큰 위협이 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 온라인 뱅킹 앱이나 결제 서비스 앱에 저장된 정보가 해커의 손에 넘어갈 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 5. iOS 탈옥이 배포하는 앱에 미치는 영향\r\r\n### 5.1. 보안 취약점 증가\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹에 노출**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 운영체제의 보안 계층이 무너져 악성 코드나 해킹에 취약합니다. 이는 앱 내에서 수집되는 데이터나 사용자 정보가 유출될 위험을 증가시키며, 개발자의 신뢰도에도 부정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **앱 무결성 손상**\r\r\n탈옥한 환경에서는 앱의 코드가 변조될 수 있어 앱의 무결성이 손상될 수 있습니다. 이는 앱의 정상적인 동작을 방해하고, 예기치 않은 오류나 버그를 유발할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.2. 불법 복제 및 수익 손실\r\r\n* **앱 불법 복제 증가**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 앱의 불법 복제나 유료 앱을 무료로 설치할 수 있는 환경을 제공합니다. 이러한 행위를 도와주는 모드 앱 또한 증가합니다. 이는 개발자의 직접적인 수익 손실로 이어지며, 앱 비즈니스 모델에 큰 타격을 줄 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **인앱 결제 우회**\r\r\n탈옥을 통한 인앱 결제 우회는 트윅을 설치하거나 앱 변조를 통해 유료 기능을 무료로 사용하는 사례도 많습니다. 이는 개발자의 추가 수익 창출 기회를 감소시키고, 공정한 수익 구조를 해칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.3. 사용자 경험 저하\r\r\n* **앱의 안정성 문제**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서는 시스템 안정성이 떨어져 앱의 크래시(crash)나 프리즈(freeze) 현상이 빈번하게 발생할 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자에게 부정적인 경험을 주며, 앱에 대한 만족도를 크게 저하시킬 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **지원 불가능한 환경**\r\r\n탈옥 환경은 표준 iOS 환경이 아니기 때문에 개발자가 예상하지 못한 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 추가적인 자원을 투입하기 어려워, 사용자 지원에 한계를 겪을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 6. iOS 탈옥 탐지 방법\r\r\n앱 개발자는 탈옥한 장치에서 앱을 보호하기 위해 기기의 상태를 탐지해야 합니다. 탈옥한 장치를 탐지하는 데 사용되는 다양한 기법들이 있으며, 각 기법은 고유한 특징과 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 주요 탐지 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.1. 시스템 파일 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 시스템 파일에 변화를 일으키는 경우가 많습니다. 대표적인 예로 `/private/var/lib/cydia`나 `/bin/bash` 같은 파일들이 존재하는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 이러한 파일들은 일반적으로 탈옥 도구를 설치할 때 생성됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc isJailbroken() -> Bool {\r\r\n    // 확인할 시스템 파일 경로들\r\r\n    let jailbreakPaths = [\r\r\n        \"/private/var/lib/cydia\",  // Cydia 파일\r\r\n        \"/bin/bash\",               // bash 파일\r\r\n        \"/usr/sbin/sshd\",          // SSH 서버 파일\r\r\n        \"/etc/apt\"                 // APT 디렉터리\r\r\n    ]\r\r\n    \r\r\n    // 각 파일/디렉터리 존재 여부 체크\r\r\n    for path

[palera1n](https://palera.in/), unc0ver 등이 대표적인 예입니다. 특히, 일부 웹사이트에서는 별도의 PC 없이도 iPhone에서 직접 탈옥할 수 있는 도구를 제공하며, 이를 이용해 많은 일반 사용자들도 손쉽게 탈옥을 시도할 수 있습니다. **탈옥한 iPhone에서는 트윅(Tweak)이나 모드 앱(Modified App)을 아무런 제약 없이 자유롭게 설치할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak01.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://palera.in/) \r\r\n\r\r\n### 게임 앱의 피해 사례\r\r\n![Jailbreak_02.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak02.png)\r\r\nNHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' \r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 탈옥한 iOS 환경에서 최근 피해가 지속적으로 발생하는 분야는 바로 모바일 게임입니다. 과거에는 특정 사용자의 단독적인 해킹으로 피해가 크지 않았지만, 최근에는 조직적이고 상업적으로 특정 게임을 타깃으로 해커들이 게임 앱을 해킹하고 변조하여 이를 배포하는 사례가 많아지고 있습니다. 대표적으로 iOS 모드 앱 배포 사이트인 [iOSGods.com](iOSGods.com)과 같은 사이트들이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_03.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak03.png)\r\r\n(Source: iOSGods.com) \r\r\n\r\r\n하지만 공개된 사이트에서 배포되던 것과 달리 최근에는 텔레그램 등의 단체 대화방에서 은밀하게 거래가 이루어지기도 합니다. 때문에 개발사에서는 일일이 iOS 모드 앱 대응이 쉽지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 손쉽게 모드 앱을 설치하여 일부 유저가 게임 내에서 어뷰징을 하면 그 수가 적을지라도 게임사에게는 치명적인 피해를 입히게 됩니다. 게이머들이 게임을 하는 목적은 경쟁에서 승리하는 것인 경우가 많습니다. 하지만 어뷰징을 통해 노력 없이 한 번에 성과를 획득하는 일이 생기고 일부 유료 콘텐츠를 정당한 지불 없이 이용하기도 합니다. 이렇게 되면 유저들은 정당하게 엄청난 시간과 노력, 그리고 돈을 들여 게임을 할 가치를 못 느끼게 되고, 결국 게임 내 결제를 중단하거나 게임에서 이탈하게 되며, 이는 게임사의 매출 하락으로 이어집니다. 게임의 매출은 1~3%의 소수 유저들이 만들어 내기 때문입니다. 실제로 저희 NHN AppGuard의 한 조사에 따르면 대형 게임 해킹 사건 이후 매출이 하락했다는 결과가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_04.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak04.png)\r\r\nNHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n결과적으로 게임사의 매출과 앱 서비스에 대한 고객의 신뢰가 하락하게 되는 것입니다.\r\r\n자세한 내용은 [NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16｜사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z | 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법

4.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_05.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak05.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JailbreakMe) \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n**JailbreakMe**는 Safari 웹 브라우저를 이용해 탈옥하는 방식으로, 사용자가 특정 웹사이트를 방문하는 것만으로도 탈옥이 가능했습니다. 이는 PDF 렌더링 엔진의 보안 취약점을 이용한 것으로, 사용자 입장에서 가장 간편한 탈옥 방법이었습니다. \r\r\n그러나 Apple이 보안 패치를 적용하면서 더 이상 사용이 불가능해졌습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Redsn0w & Greenpois0n (iOS 4.x ~ 5.x)\r\r\n이 시기의 탈옥은 USB를 통해 기기를 컴퓨터에 연결한 뒤, 전용 탈옥 프로그램을 실행하는 방식으로 이루어졌습니다. **Redsn0w**와 **Greenpois0n**은 각각 다른 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행하였으며, tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 해제됨) 및 untethered(영구 탈옥) 방식으로 나뉘었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Evasi0n (iOS 6.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_06.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak06.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://evasi0n.com/) \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n**Evasi0n**은 iOS 6에서 사용된 탈옥 도구로, USB 연결을 통해 시스템의 여러 취약점을 연쇄적으로 이용하여 완전한 탈옥을 가능하게 했습니다. 당시 매우 높은 안정성과 호환성을 제공하여 널리 사용되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Pangu & TaiG (iOS 7.x ~ 9.x)\r\r\n**Pangu**와 **TaiG**는 중국 해커 그룹이 개발한 탈옥 도구로, iOS 7 이후 보안이 강화된 환경에서도 탈옥을 가능하게 했습니다. 특히, TaiG는 iOS 8에서 Apple이 취약점을 보완한 패치를 우회하는 새로운 기법을 도입하여 탈옥을 성공시켰습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Yalu (iOS 10.x)\r\r\n**Yalu**는 iOS 10에서 사용된 탈옥 도구로, 개발자인 Luca Todesco가 만든 것으로 유명합니다. 그러나 이 탈옥은 semi-untethered 방식이어서 기기를 재부팅하면 탈옥이 해제되며, 다시 실행하려면 특정 앱을 실행해야 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### unc0ver & Electra (iOS 11.x ~ 14.x)\r\r\n**unc0ver**와 **Electra**는 최근까지 사용되는 탈옥 도구로, 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행합니다. 특히 unc0ver는 안정성이 높아 많은 사용자들이 선호하였으며, 탈옥 후에도 시스템 기능을 최대한 유지할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### checkra1n (iOS 12.x ~ 14.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_07.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak07.png)\r\r\n (Source: https://checkra.in/) \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n \n\r\r\n**checkra1n**은 기존의 탈옥과 달리, checkm8이라는 하드웨어 부트롬(bootrom) 취약점을 이용한 영구 탈옥 방식입니다. \r\r\n이로 인해 iOS 버전에 상관없이 특정 기기에서는 항상 탈옥이 가능하지만, 반대로 Apple이 소프트웨어 패치를 통해 막을 수 없는 특성을 가집니다. 다만, checkra1n은 semi-tethered 방식으로, 재부팅 후에는 다시 탈옥 프로세스를 수행해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n최근에는 Apple이 보안 강화를 지속하면서 탈옥이 점점 어려워지고 있으며, 대부분의 탈옥이 semi-tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 풀림) 형태로 제공되고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 4. 탈옥한 iOS 장치의 보안 취약점\r\r\n탈옥한 iOS 장치는 Apple이 제공하는 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하기 때문에 여러 가지 보안 취약점에 노출됩니다. 다음은 탈옥한 iOS가 갖는 주요 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **시스템 보안 우회**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple의 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하여 시스템 파일을 수정할 수 있습니다. 이는 악성 코드나 바이러스가 시스템에 침투하기 쉽게 만듭니다.\r\r\n* **앱 간 데이터 접근**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 앱 간의 데이터 접근이 가능해져, 민감한 정보가 유출될 위험이 높아집니다.\r\r\n* **루트 권한 노출**: 탈옥한 기기는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있어, 시스템 파일을 자유롭게 변경할 수 있습니다. 이는 해커가 기기를 완전히 제어할 수 있는 가능성을 열어줍니다.\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹 위험**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 악성 소프트웨어나 해킹 툴이 쉽게 설치될 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있습니다.\r\r\n* **보안 업데이트 차단**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple로부터 자동 업데이트를 받지 못하게 되어 중요한 보안 패치와 기능 업데이트를 놓칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n특히, 탈옥한 장치에는 앱의 실행을 제한하는 보안 프로세스가 없기 때문에, 악성 소프트웨어가 시스템에 침투할 가능성이 높아집니다. 이러한 위험은 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 보호하는 데 큰 위협이 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 온라인 뱅킹 앱이나 결제 서비스 앱에 저장된 정보가 해커의 손에 넘어갈 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 5. iOS 탈옥이 배포하는 앱에 미치는 영향\r\r\n### 5.1. 보안 취약점 증가\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹에 노출**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 운영체제의 보안 계층이 무너져 악성 코드나 해킹에 취약합니다. 이는 앱 내에서 수집되는 데이터나 사용자 정보가 유출될 위험을 증가시키며, 개발자의 신뢰도에도 부정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **앱 무결성 손상**\r\r\n탈옥한 환경에서는 앱의 코드가 변조될 수 있어 앱의 무결성이 손상될 수 있습니다. 이는 앱의 정상적인 동작을 방해하고, 예기치 않은 오류나 버그를 유발할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.2. 불법 복제 및 수익 손실\r\r\n* **앱 불법 복제 증가**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 앱의 불법 복제나 유료 앱을 무료로 설치할 수 있는 환경을 제공합니다. 이러한 행위를 도와주는 모드 앱 또한 증가합니다. 이는 개발자의 직접적인 수익 손실로 이어지며, 앱 비즈니스 모델에 큰 타격을 줄 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **인앱 결제 우회**\r\r\n탈옥을 통한 인앱 결제 우회는 트윅을 설치하거나 앱 변조를 통해 유료 기능을 무료로 사용하는 사례도 많습니다. 이는 개발자의 추가 수익 창출 기회를 감소시키고, 공정한 수익 구조를 해칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.3. 사용자 경험 저하\r\r\n* **앱의 안정성 문제**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서는 시스템 안정성이 떨어져 앱의 크래시(crash)나 프리즈(freeze) 현상이 빈번하게 발생할 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자에게 부정적인 경험을 주며, 앱에 대한 만족도를 크게 저하시킬 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **지원 불가능한 환경**\r\r\n탈옥 환경은 표준 iOS 환경이 아니기 때문에 개발자가 예상하지 못한 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 추가적인 자원을 투입하기 어려워, 사용자 지원에 한계를 겪을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 6. iOS 탈옥 탐지 방법\r\r\n앱 개발자는 탈옥한 장치에서 앱을 보호하기 위해 기기의 상태를 탐지해야 합니다. 탈옥한 장치를 탐지하는 데 사용되는 다양한 기법들이 있으며, 각 기법은 고유한 특징과 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 주요 탐지 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.1. 시스템 파일 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 시스템 파일에 변화를 일으키는 경우가 많습니다. 대표적인 예로 `/private/var/lib/cydia`나 `/bin/bash` 같은 파일들이 존재하는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 이러한 파일들은 일반적으로 탈옥 도구를 설치할 때 생성됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc isJailbroken() -> Bool {\r\r\n    // 확인할 시스템 파일 경로들\r\r\n    let jailbreakPaths = [\r\r\n        \"/private/var/lib/cydia\",  // Cydia 파일\r\r\n        \"/bin/bash\",               // bash 파일\r\r\n        \"/usr/sbin/sshd\",          // SSH 서버 파일\r\r\n        \"/etc/apt\"                 // APT 디렉터리\r\r\n    ]\r\r\n    \r\r\n    // 각 파일/디렉터리 존재 여부 체크\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakPaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            return true  // 파일이 존재하면 탈옥된 기기\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    \r\r\n    return false  // 파일이 없으면 탈옥되지 않은 기기\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.2. API 호출 감지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 주로 사용되는 특정 API 호출을 감지하여 탈옥 여부를 판단할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, `fork()`, `sysctl()` 등의 함수 호출은 탈옥과 관련된 행동을 나타낼 수 있습니다. 이러한 함수 호출을 모니터링하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc checkFork() -> Bool {\r\r\n    let pid = fork()\r\r\n    if pid == 0 {\r\r\n        // 자식 프로세스 종료 (fork가 성공하면 탈옥 가능성이 높음)\r\r\n        exit(0)\r\r\n    } else if pid > 0 {\r\r\n        print(\"fork() 호출 가능 - 탈옥된 기기일 수 있음\")\r\r\n        return true\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.3. 탈옥 도구 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 MobileSubstrate, Frida, Cydia 등과 같은 탈옥 도구들이 설치됩니다. 이러한 도구들이 설치되어 있는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Cydia 앱이 설치되어 있는지 확인하는 방법이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n// 확인할 파일 및 디렉터리 목록\r\r\nlet jailbreakFilePaths: [String] = [\r\r\n    \"/Applications/Cydia.app\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/lib/cydia/\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/tmp/cydia.log\"\r\r\n]\r\r\n\r\r\n// 파일 존재 여부 확인 함수\r\r\nfunc checkJailbreakFiles() -> Bool {\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakFilePaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            print(\"탈옥 관련 파일 발견: \\(path)\")\r\r\n            return true\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.4. 비공식 앱 설치 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 Apple의 공식 앱 스토어 외에도 비공식 앱 스토어를 통해 앱을 설치할 수 있습니다. 따라서 비공식적으로 설치된 앱들을 탐지하여 탈옥 여부를 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.5. 루트 접근 권한 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있기 때문에, 루트 권한으로 실행된 프로세스나 파일들을 확인하는 방법이 있습니다. 시스템 내에서 루트 권한을 사용하는 프로세스나 파일 접근 시 이를 탐지할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위험을 완전히 없애는 것은 불가능할 수 있지만, 여러 방어 기법을 결합하여 다층적인 보안을 구축하는 것이 중요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 7. 나가며\r\r\niOS 앱 개발자는 사용자 데이터를 보호하고, 앱의 안전한 환경을 제공하는 중요한 책임을 지고 있습니다. 탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위협을 사전에 탐지하고 방어하는 것은 필수적인 작업입니다. 탈옥 탐지 및 방어 기능을 통해 앱의 보안을 강화하고, 사용자가 안전하게 앱을 사용할 수 있도록 보장해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n글로벌 IT기업 NHN이 직접 만든 **NHN AppGuard**는 탈옥 기기에서 발생하는 다양한 보안 위협에 대응할 수 있는 필수적인 보안 솔루션입니다. NHN AppGuard를 적용하여 배포하면 아래와 같이 탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단할 수 있도록 정책을 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_08.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak08.png)\r\r\n 탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단하기 위한 NHN AppGuard 정책 설정 화면\r\r\n \n\r\r\n 배포된 앱이 실행되는 중 탈옥이 탐지되면 곧바로 탐지에 대한 로그를 남기며 이를 추적할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n \r\r\n![Jailbreak_09.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak09.png)\r\r\n탈옥 탐지 로그 조회 화면\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 NHN AppGuard는 앱 운영자가 기기 보안에 대한 걱정 없이 안정적인 서비스 제공에 집중할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 강력한 탈옥 탐지와 차단 기능을 통해 앱의 무결성과 사용자 데이터를 완벽하게 보호할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n>  [NHN AppGuard 더 알아보기](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/service/security/nhn-appguard)\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 iOS 탈옥의 개념과 역사, 탈옥한 장치에서의 피해 사례, 최신 탈옥 방법, 보안 위협, 그리고 개발자가 탈옥을 탐지하고 방어하는 방법에 대해 알아보았습니다. iOS 앱 개발자 분들뿐만 아니라 iOS를 사용하거나 보안에 관심이 있는 모든 분들께 도움이 되었길 바랍니다. 긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_202507-01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooter20250701.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 이 블로그를 통해서 반복적으로 하는 이야기가 몇 개 있는데, 아마도 지금까지 가장 많이 반복적으로 주장한 주제가 “하나만 하자”인 것 같다. 지금까지 아마도 이 주제로 대략 20개가 넘는 글을 썼던 것 같다.\n얼마 전에 미국의 치킨 체인점 Raising Cane’s 창업가 Todd Graves의 인터뷰를 흥미롭게 들었는데, 이 회사는 치킨 핑거만 판매하면서 초기 성공을 거뒀다. 그렇게 하는데 무려 20년이 넘게 걸렸다. 이후 자연스럽게 일반 후라이드 치킨 및 다른 치킨 메뉴로 확장하자는 이야기가 내부에서도 나왔고, 외부에서도 계속 수평적 확장에 대한 압박이 있었다. 하지만, 이 회사의 창업가는 치킨 핑거 시장만 잡아도 엄청난 회사를 만들 수 있다고 믿었고, 지금까지도 닭으로 만들 수 있는 수많은 메뉴로 확장하지 않고 오롯이 치킨 핑거 기반의 메뉴만 계속 파고 들어가고 있다.\n결과는, 현재까진 매우 성공적이다. 작년에 거의 7조 원의 매출을 달성했고, 미국뿐만 아니라 중동과 유럽 쪽으로도 진출했다. 치킨 핑거 하나에만 집중하면서, “치킨 핑거 하면 Raising Cane’s이지”라는 브랜딩을 제대로 만들었고, 이후엔 매장당 매출과 수익성에 집중하면서 거대한 치킨 핑거 왕국을 만들어가고 있다.\n나는 모든 스타트업이 그 분야에서 – 분야가 아무리 좁더라도 – 최고가 되기 전까진 웬만하면 하나에만 집중하는 게 가장 효율적인 전략이라고 생각한다. 대기업과 같이 풍부하고 낭비해도 되는 자원이 – 즉, 돈과 사람 – 없기 때문에 어느 정도의 규모가 만들어지는 버티컬을 선택한 후에 아주 깊게 파고 들어가서 남들보다 훨씬 더 뾰족한 사업을 만드는 게 작은 회사엔 매우 중요하다. 이 작은 버티컬을 장악해서 이 분야에서는 압도적인 1위가 되고, 이후에 다른 버티컬로 확장해서 같은 전략을 반복하다 보면 어느 순간 모든 분야에서 압도적인 1위가 될 수 있을 것이다. 위에서 이야기한 Raising Cane’s가 좋은 사례라고 생각한다. 닭요리라는 시장에서 치킨 핑거 패스트푸드라는 버티컬을 선택했고, 20년 이상 사업을 하면서 이 버티컬에서 가장 뾰족한 사업을 성공적으로 만들어서 새로운 경쟁사가 이 분야에 등장하더라도 이 뾰족한 사업을 이기는 건 매우 힘들 것이다.\n하나만 제대로 하는 이 컨셉을 복싱이라는 운동에 적용해 보자. 솔직히 이 비유가 맞는진 모르겠지만 나는 적절한 것 같다.\n두 명의 복서가 있는데 한 선수는 복싱의 모든 기술을 전반적으로 다 배우고, 매일 모든 기술을 다 골고루 연마한다. 잽, 훅, 어퍼컷 등 모든 펀치 기술을 연습하고 이 기본 기술들을 기반으로 다양한 공격 조합도 만들고, 이 또한 골고루 연습한다. 공격만 연습하는 게 아니라, 수비 기술도 배워서 열심히 연습한다. 모든 기술을 연마하니, 이 선수가 연습하는 걸 보면 굉장히 화려하고 멋있다. 토탈 복싱이다. 그리고 이 선수는 이미 복싱을 꽤 오래 했고 우승 경험도 있는 노련한 복서다.\n다른 선수는 첫 번째 선수와 완전히 다른 방식으로 연습한다. 이분은 딱 한 가지만 연습한다. 왼손잡이라서 레프트 잽 하나만 정말 죽어라 열심히 반복한다. 매일 새벽 5시에 연습을 시작해서 하루에 20시간씩 다른 건 안 하고 레프트 잽만 연습한다. 수비 기술은 아예 안 배우고, 공격만 연마하고, 공격 중에서도 잽만 연습한다. 이 선수가 연습하는 걸 보면 정말 단순하고 재미없다. 이 선수는 복싱을 시작한 지 얼마 안 돼서, 상대 선수보다 연습할 수 있는 시간도 절대적으로 부족한 선수다.\n이 두 선수가 링 위에서 싸우며 어떻게 될까? 아마도 10번 싸우면 9번 이상은 경험 있는 토탈 복서인 첫 번째 선수가 쉽게 이길 것이다. 레프트 잽만 할 줄 아는 선수는 아마도 상대방 몸 근처에도 못 갈 것이고, 금방 KO 패 당할 확률이 높다. 하지만, 집요하게 기회를 노리다 보면 10번 중 1번은 어쩌면 상대방의 얼굴과 몸에 왼손으로 잽을 날릴 수 있을 것이고, 상대 선수의 가드가 한 번 풀리면 집중적으로 연타를 날릴 수 있을 것이다. 그리고 만 시간 동안 연습한 잽은 제대로만 들어간다면 상대방을 충분히 쓰러뜨릴 수 있을 정도로 위협적인 무기라서 어쩌면 10번 중 1번은 이길 수 있을지도 모른다.\n연습할 수 있는 시간이 절대적으로 부족한 신인 선수가 노련한 선수를 이기는 방법은 두 가지밖에 없다. 연습량을 절대적으로 늘리는 것과 하나의 기술만 뾰족하게 연마하는 것이다.\n물론, 위의 예시는 그냥 내가 마음대로 극화시킨 상황이다. 레프트 잽 하나만으로 시합에 이기는 건 불가능하다. 하지만, 어떤 말을 하려는 진 대부분 이해했을 것이다. 위에서 말 한 노련한 토탈 복서는 이미 시장에서 오랜 시간 동안 사업을 잘하고 있는 대기업과 같은 기존 플레이어다. 이들은 돈도 많고 사람도 많고 그동안 쌓아 놓은 내공과 업력이 있다. 하지만, 이들에겐 특별히 뾰족한 무기라고 할만한 건 없고, 그냥 하고 있는 모든 분야에서 평균 이상으로만 사업을 하고 있다.\n잽만 죽어라 연습하는 복서는 이제 시장에 진입한 스타트업이다. 상대적으로 시간도 없고 돈도 없지만, 한 가지 기술만 무한 연습해서 레프트 잽에 있어서는 이 세상 그 어떤 복서보다 더 빠르고, 날카롭고, 많이 상대방을 때릴 수 있다. 이 엉성한 복서에게 노련한 복서가 질 확률은 낮지만, 잠깐 방심한 틈을 타서 잽이 들어가기 시작하면 어쩌면 이길 수도 있다. 이길 확률이 매우 낮지만, 반대로 그나마 그 확률을 극대화할 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법은 하나만 열심히 하는 것이다.\nRaising Cane’s도 치킨핑거 분야에서 유명해지고 성공한 후에 다른 분야로 확장하지 않을까 싶은데 아직까진 그런 움직임이 보이지 않고 있다. 오히려 이 하나의 제품을 더 연구하고 있고, 더 많은 나라로 지점을 확대하고 있는 것 같다.\nB급 사업 10개 하는 것보다 A+급 사업 하나만 제대로 하는 게 스타트업에겐 가장 좋은 전략이다.",

US 오픈과 호주 오픈은 하드 코트(콘크리트&고무 코트), 프랑스 오픈은 클레이 코트(흙 코트)에서 열리지만, 윔블던은 지금도 잔디 위에서 경기를 치르고 있어요.\n* 4대 그랜드슬램: 테니스에서 가장 권위 있는 4개 대회를 뜻해요. 호주 오픈(1월), 프랑스 오픈(5월), 윔블던(7월), US 오픈(9월)으로 구성되어 있어요.\n물론 영국은 잔디가 잘 자라는 나라예요. 하지만 이건 단순한 기후 문제가 아닙니다. 유발 하라리는 ⟪호모 데우스⟫에서 잔디에 대해 이렇게 말했죠. “나는 부자이고, 힘이 있다. 그리고 이 푸르른 사치를 감당할 수 있을 만큼의 땅과 농노를 소유하고 있다.” 잔디는 권위의 상징이었습니다. 자연스럽게 왕의 궁전과 공작의 대저택은 물론 대통령과 수상들이 집무를 보는 곳에서도 잔디밭이 중요한 공간이 되었죠.\n19세기 영국 사회를 이끌어 가고 있던 ‘젠틀맨 아마추어’들도 같은 이유로 잔디밭을 사랑했어요. 당연히 이들이 즐기던 테니스도 잔디에서 열려야 했고, 윔블던은 이 전통을 지금까지 이어오고 있습니다. 코트 위 잔디는 8mm로 깎아야 가장 이상적인 경기가 펼쳐진다고 알려져 있는데, 이를 맞추기 위해 윔블던 잔디 관리팀은 매일 새벽부터 잔디를 손질합니다.\n잔디에 대한 집착은 협회 이름에서도 드러납니다. 영국 테니스를 관장하는 공식 조직 이름은 ‘Lawn Tennis Association(LTA)’, 직역하면 ‘잔디 테니스 협회’입니다. 경기 방식이 아니라 코트가 잔디냐 아니냐를 기준으로 종목 이름부터 정한 셈이죠. 그만큼 이들은 잔디에 진심이었어요.\n아마추어리즘의 상징 윔블던이\n프로에게 문을 열게 된 이유\n젠틀맨 아마추어들이 주도하던 LTA의 목표는 중상류층이 즐기던 테니스의 사회적 지위를 지키며 윔블던을 세계 최고 권위의 대회로 만드는 것이었어요. 이를 위해 윔블던에는 오직 아마추어 선수만 출전할 수 있었죠.\n하지만 이 제도는 점점 한계를 드러냅니다. 그 시작은 영국의 테니스 영웅 프레드 페리입니다. 프레드 페리는 1934년부터 3년 연속 윔블던 남자 단식 우승을 차지했지만, 노동계급 출신이라는 이유로 차별을 받았습니다. 결국 그는 1936년에 프로로 전향하고 미국으로 귀화하죠. 라켓과 훈련비까지 스스로 감당해야 했던 아마추어리즘의 벽을 넘기 위해서였습니다. 이후 그의 이름을 딴 패션 브랜드 ‘프레드 페리’도 탄생합니다. 당시 영국 사회는 그를 ‘아마추어리즘을 배신한 상업주의자’로 바라봤죠.\n\n영국의 두 테니스 영웅, 앤디 머리와 프레드 페리 / 사진: 로이터\n프레드 페리가 떠났지만, 윔블던은 여전히 전통을 고수했습니다. 2차 세계대전 전까지 대회에는 20만 명 이상의 관중이 몰렸고, 1955년 대회에는 27만 명이 찾을 정도로 대회는 흥행했기 때문입니다.\n하지만 1963년, 당대 최고의 선수였던 호주 출신 로드 레이버가 프로로 전향하면서 분위기가 달라집니다. 레이버를 따라 여러 스타 선수들이 아마추어 대회를 떠나자, 윔블던은 점점 매력을 잃기 시작했습니다. 1960년대 초반까지는 40만 명의 구름 관중이 몰렸던 윔블던 대회의 관중 수는 1965년 27만 명까지 떨어졌고, 입장 수입도 크게 줄었습니다. 레이버 수준의 경기를 아마추어 선수에게 기대하기 어려웠기 때문이죠.\n결국 윔블던은 1968년 대회부터 프로 선수의 출전을 허용합니다. ‘젠틀맨 아마추어’의 자부심이 경제적 현실 앞에서 한계를 드러낸 것이죠. 이때부터 윔블던은 프로와 아마추어가 함께 출전하는 오픈(Open) 대회로 전환됐고, 선수들에게 상금도 지급되기 시작했습니다. 윔블던의 결정에 따라 다른 그랜드슬램 대회들도 같은 해 모두 오픈 대회로 바뀌게 됩니다.\n윔블던의 가치가 빛나는\n해외 중계권 수입\n오픈 대회로 전환된 이후, 윔블던은 상업화의 길을 본격적으로 걷기 시작했어요. 특히 스포츠 비즈니스가 급성장하던 1980년대 후반부터는 경영 목표도 명확해졌죠. 그건 바로 테니스 대회 매출 1위를 자랑하던 US 오픈을 따라잡는 것이었어요. 당시만 해도 격차는 꽤 컸습니다. 1985년 기준으로 US 오픈의 매출은 약 40억 원, 윔블던은 그 절반도 안 되는 약 18억 원 수준이었거든요.\n하지만 2023년에는 두 대회의 매출 차이가 거의 사라졌습니다. US 오픈은 약 7,013억 원, 윔블던은 약 6,808억 원의 수입을 올리며 바짝 따라붙었어요. 여전히 US 오픈이 근소하게 앞서긴 하지만, 영국과 미국의 시장 규모 차이를 고려하면 윔블던은 매우 효율적인 방식으로 수익을 만들어내고 있습니다.\n\n두 대회가 가장 크게 다른 부분은 중계권 수입 구조예요. US 오픈은 미국 내 중계권 수입만 연간 약 1,023억 원에 달하지만, 윔블던은 영국 내에서 약 759억 원 정도에 그쳐요. 이 차이는 ‘보편적 시청권’이라는 영국의 제도에서 비롯됩니다. 윔블던은 전체 가구의 95% 이상이 무료로 시청할 수 있어야 하는 경기로 지정돼 있어서, 반드시 공영방송 BBC 같은 지상파에서만 중계해야 하거든요. 민영 방송 간의 경쟁이 제한되다 보니, 중계권 수익을 공격적으로 높이기 어려운 구조예요.\n윔블던은 이 약점을 해외 시장을 통해 보완하고 있어요. 윔블던 전체 매출에서 중계권료가 차지하는 비중이 56%인데, 44%가 해외 중계권 수입이에요. 금액으로는 약 3,000억 원에 달하죠. 윔블던은 이렇게 자국에서는 전통을 지키면서도, 해외에서는 수익을 극대화하는 전략을 택하고 있어요. 중계권 경쟁이 불가능한 영국 시장의 한계를 글로벌 시장으로 메운 것이죠. 그래서 윔블던은 ‘해외 시청자들이 먹여 살리는 대회’라는 평가를 받기도 합니다.\n광고수는 최소한\n광고비는 최대한\n\n2024년, 윔블던의 스폰서십 수입은 처음으로 US 오픈을 넘어섰어요. 4대 그랜드슬램 가운데 스폰서십 매출 규모 1위에 오른 건 윔블던, 그 뒤를 US 오픈, 프랑스 오픈, 호주 오픈이 이었죠.\n업계에서는 윔블던이 스폰서십으로 US 오픈을 앞지르기 어려울 것이라고 예측해왔습니다. 윔블던의 스폰서로 참여할 수 있는 기업은 단 17개뿐이고, 이들조차 경기장에서 로고는 최소한으로만 노출할 수 있기 때문입니다.\n실제로 윔블던 경기장에 가보면 네트나 코트 바닥은 물론, 주요 카메라 앵글 어디에도 큼지막한 스폰서 로고를 찾기 어렵습니다. 이는 관중들이나 시청자들이 경기를 펼치는 선수와 녹색 그라운드에 더 집중할 수 있도록 하겠다는 윔블던의 의지와 자존심이 반영된 결과입니다.\n대신 윔블던은 네트와 코트에 기업 로고가 최소한으로 노출되어야 한다는 제한된 환경을 마케팅 포인트로 바꿨어요. 한정된 최소한의 광고 기회와 ‘클린 코트’를 고수하는 철학을 프리미엄 전략으로 어필한 거죠.\n\n가장 큰 스폰서 비용을 내더라도 최소한으로 경기장에 노출되는 바클레이스 은행 로고 / 사진: 로이터\n윔블던 스폰서 가운데 눈길을 끄는 기업은 3개입니다. 영국을 대표하는 바클레이스 은행은 2023년 기준 연간 324억 원 규모의 후원 계약을 맺었고, 이는 윔블던 전체 스폰서십 중 단일 기업으로서 가장 큰 금액입니다. 브렉시트 이후 치열해진 영국 금융시장 경쟁 속에서, 바클레이스는 윔블던을 통해 자국 내 상징성과 이미지를 강화하려는 전략을 펼치고 있어요.\nIBM은 1990년부터 윔블던과 함께해온 오랜 후원사입니다. 최근에는 생성형 AI ‘왓슨X’를 활용해 윔블던의 디지털 경험을 한층 끌어올렸죠. 이를 활용한 대표적인 서비스가 ‘캐치 미 업(Catch Me Up)’입니다. 이 서비스를 통해 윔블던 공식 웹사이트와 앱에서는 경기 전 프리뷰, 경기 중 하이라이트, 경기 후 리뷰까지 모든 콘텐츠를 AI가 자동으로 생성하고, 이용자의 국적과 관심사에 맞춰 맞춤형 콘텐츠를 제공하고 있어요. IBM과의 스폰서십은 전통이 강한 윔블던 대회에 기술 혁신이라는 새로운 가치를 불어 넣고 있습니다.\n2016년 처음 윔블던 후원사로 참여한 에미레이츠 항공도 주목할 만한 스폰서입니다. 에미레이츠는 아스널, 레알 마드리드, AC 밀란 등 유럽 주요 축구 클럽의 메인 스폰서이고, 2006년부터 2019년까지는 파리 생제르맹(PSG)의 공식 셔츠 스폰서이기도 했어요. 현재 PSG는 카타르 항공이, 맨체스터 시티는 에티하드 항공이 메인 스폰서를 맡고 있습니다. 에미레이츠는 축구처럼 대중성이 높은 종목뿐 아니라, 고급스러운 이미지를 가진 윔블던을 통해 유럽 상류층과의 브랜드 접점을 강화하고 있어요. 중동 항공사 간 글로벌 스폰서십 경쟁에서, 에미레이츠는 윔블던을 통해 ‘고급 스포츠’ 영역에서 차별화를 꾀하는 거죠.\n가장 전통적인 방법으로\n윔블던을 즐기는 사람들\n윔블던은 직접 관전하기 어려운 대회예요. 주요 코트의 관중석 규모가 상대적으로 작기 때문인데요. 전체 관중 수는 약 50만 명으로, US 오픈이나 호주 오픈의 절반 수준에 불과해요.\n그래서 윔블던은 1924년부터 퍼블릭 발롯(Public Ballot) 제도를 도입해왔어요. 이는 티켓을 단순 판매하는 대신, 신청자 중 추첨을 통해 구매권을 부여하는 시스템이에요. 누구에게나 공정한 기회를 주기 위한 장치죠. 당첨 확률은 약 10% 정도라고 알려져 있어요.\n미리 예매하는 방법 외에도, 윔블던은 일부 입장권을 당일 현장 선착순으로 판매하고 있어요. 줄 서기(queuing) 문화는 근대 영국 사회의 전통 중 하나로, 지금도 경기장 앞 언덕에서 길게 늘어선 팬들의 모습을 쉽게 볼 수 있어요.\n\n윔블던 힐에 앉아 경기를 즐기는 테니스 팬들의 모습 / 사진: 로이터\n줄을 서서 구매할 수 있는 가장 저렴한 티켓은 ‘그라운드 티켓’이에요. 이 티켓으로 주요 코트 입장은 불가능하지만, 윔블던 힐(Wimbledon Hill)이라 불리는 언덕에서 대형 스크린을 통해 경기를 관람할 수 있어요. 딸기와 크림을 먹으며 경기를 응원하는 이 풍경은 윔블던의 상징 중 하나로 자리 잡았어요. 이 공간은 하루 최대 4만 2천 명까지 수용할 수 있습니다.\n윔블던 힐이 상징적 공간으로 자리잡은 데는 사실 또 다른 이유가 숨어 있어요. 1936년 프레드 페리 이후 오랜 시간 영국 남자 선수가 우승하지 못하자, 팬들은 언덕에 함께 모여 열띤 응원을 이어간 것이죠. 그 염원은 2013년, 앤디 머리가 77년 만에 우승을 차지하며 현실이 되기도 했습니다.\n사라진 선심과\n새로운 시스템\n2025년 윔블던의 가장 큰 변화 중 하나는 선심이 사라졌다는 점이에요. 호주 오픈(2021), US 오픈(2022)에 이어 윔블던도 비디오 판독 시스템을 도입하며 선심* 없는 코트를 운영하게 된 거죠.\n* 선심: 공이 경기장 선 안팎으로 벗어났는지를 판단하고, 이를 손짓으로 알리는 심판\n윔블던에서 선심은 단순한 경기 운영 요원이 아니었어요. 후원사 랄프 로렌의 유니폼을 입고 코트를 지키던 선심들은 전통을 상징하는 존재이기도 했거든요. 그래서 이 변화에 대한 팬들의 반응은 엇갈려요. “윔블던의 위대한 전통이 무너졌다”고 아쉬워하는 이들도 있고, “이제는 더 이상 라인콜을 두고 벌어지는 불필요한 다툼이 사라질 것”이라며 환영하는 팬들도 있었어요.\n사라진 선심은 전통과 변화 사이를 오가며 끊임없이 진화해온 윔블던의 또 다른 단면이에요. 흰색 유니폼, 잔디 코트, 후원사 수 제한 같은 고유의 전통을 지키면서도, 경기 운영과 수익 구조는 시대의 흐름에 맞게 유연하게 바꿔왔죠. 덕분에 윔블던은 아마추어리즘과 프로페셔널리즘이 정교하게 공존하는 스포츠 비즈니스의 상징으로 평가 받고 있습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",

제약 없는 디지털 금융생활\n스테이블코인은 빠른 거래 속도와 낮은 수수료, 그리고 안정된 가치를 가진다는 점에서 편리할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 해외 쇼핑몰에서 결제할 때나 해외에서 유학 중인 가족에게 송금할 때 등등 번거로운 환전과 높은 수수료를 감수해야 했다면, 스테이블코인 이용 시 환전 없이 빠르고 저렴하게 결제와 송금이 가능해요. 게임에서 아이템을 사고팔 때 국가별 통화가 아니라 글로벌 공통 디지털 화폐로 거래하게 되면 더 공정하고 간편한 환경이 만들어집니다. 물론 해외여행을 갈 때도 굳이 현지 통화로 환전하는 절차를 거치지 않아도 되고요.\n스테이블코인에 대해 자주 묻는 5가지\nQ1. 스테이블코인은 투자 대상이 될 수 있나요?\n→ 스테이블코인 자체는 가치가 오르지 않도록 설계돼 있어 일반적인 투자 수단은 아닙니다. 다만 예치나 운용 방식에 따라 이자를 받는 구조는 존재해요. 또한 스테이블코인 생태계가 커질 것이라고 예상한다면 관련 기업(거래소, 발행사, 네트워크 등) 투자로 인한 수익을 기대해볼 수 있습니다.\nQ2. 비트코인과 뭐가 다른가요?\n→ 비트코인은 희소성과 탈중앙화를 중요시하는 디지털 금에 가깝습니다. 반면 스테이블코인은 항상 값이 고정되어 거래·결제·송금에 쓰이는 실용 화폐라고 생각하면 이해하기 수월합니다.\nQ3. 누가 발행하나요?\n→  미국에서는 USDC를 코인베이스와 서클이 함께 발행하고 있으며, 페이팔, 리플, 테더 같은 기업들도 스테이블코인을 발행하거나 관련 서비스를 운영하고 있습니다. 한국에서는 아직 정해진 바가 없으며, 금융과 플랫폼 서비스를 동시에 운영하는 IT기업들이 원화 스테이블코인을 발행할 후보 기업으로 꼽히고 있습니다.\nQ4. 언제 사용하나요?\n→ 해외 송금, 해외 결제, 게임 아이템 거래, 글로벌 쇼핑몰 결제 등 디지털 환경에서 실시간 송금이 필요한 모든 곳에서 사용됩니다.\nQ5. 위험하지는 않나요?\n→ 담보 자산이 실제로 있는지, 발행사가 파산하면 어떻게 되는지 등 신뢰성 문제가 존재합니다. 실제 부도 사례도 있었고요. 따라서 향후에는 국가 차원의 규제와 제도화가 함께 진행되어야 스테이블코인에 대한 신뢰도가 높아져 시장이 확대될 수 있습니다.\n내 금융생활에 스테이블코인을 활용하는 법\n1. 스테이블 관련 기업 알아보기\n스테이블코인에 직접 투자할 수는 없지만, 이 시장에 관심이 있다면 관련 기업들을 알아두는 것이 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 미국 스테이블코인과 관련된 곳은 코인베이스(거래소), 서클(USDC 발행사), 이더리움(인프라) 등이 있어요. 한국에서는 카카오페이, 카카오, 네이버, LG CNS 등에 관심이 집중되었으나 아직 어떤 기업이 이 시장을 주도할지 확실하지 않기 때문에 무턱대고 투자하기보다는 조심스럽게 판단하는 것이 좋습니다.\n2. 스테이블코인 직접 체험해보기\n2025년 7월 현재 국내에는 원화나 달러 기반 스테이블코인을 위한 정식 허가 제도가 아직 없고, 정부가 ‘디지털자산 기본법’을 마련 중이기에 제도가 안착되기 전인 과도기 단계라고 볼 수 있습니다. 일부 언론에서는 동대문 시장이나 무역 결제 등에 스테이블코인이 활용되고 있다고 하지만, 아직까지 공식적인 결제 수단으로 자리 잡은 것은 아닙니다.\n다만, 국내 5대 가상자산 거래소(업비트, 빗썸, 코빗, 코인원, 고팍스)에서는 원화를 USDT나 USDC 같은 달러 스테이블코인으로 바꾼 뒤, 이를 기준으로 비트코인이나 이더리움 같은 다른 암호화폐를 사고파는 방식이 흔합니다. 여기선 달러 기준 거래가 시장의 기본값이고 스테이블코인이 디지털 달러 역할을 행하고 있기 때문이에요.\n즉, 아직 일상생활에서 자유롭게 결제하는 수준은 아니지만, 원한다면 가상자산 투자 경험을 통해 스테이블코인의 구조와 쓰임을 체감해보는 것은 충분히 가능합니다.\n스테이블코인 개념부터 이해한다면\n예전에는 국가에서 돈을 만들고, 은행에서만 다룰 수 있다고 생각했죠. 그런데 이제는 어느새 돈도 데이터처럼 실시간으로 움직이고, 스마트폰 안에서 앱을 통해서만 주고받는 시대가 되었어요. 발행 주체가 달라지는 스테이블코인은 이러한 통화 변화의 시작점에 있는 존재입니다. 언젠가 우리에게 익숙한 화폐 대신 스테이블코인으로 결제하고 송금하는 게 당연한 날이 올지도 모르죠. 지금은 낯선 용어에 마음을 열고 개념을 파악해두는 작은 호기심이면 충분합니다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호\n해당 콘텐츠는 2025.07.09. 기준으로 작성되었습니다.\n– 특정 기업명을 언급한 것은 예시와 설명을 위한 목적이며, 이는 투자 권유나 종목 추천을 위한 것이 아닙니다.\n– 상기 정보는 투자 상품의 판매나 권유를 위하여 제작된 것이 아닙니다. 본 자료 중 제3자로부터 제공받은 정보의 오류 및 생략에 대하여 당사는 책임을 지지 않습니다.",

AI 에이전트는 대규모 언어 모델(LLM, Large Language Model)을 기반으로 목표 달성을 위해 필요한 작업을 스스로 판단하고 수행하는 시스템이다.\n토스는 팀원들이 챗GPT를 실제 업무에 원활히 활용할 수 있도록 조직 차원의 지원 체계도 함께 갖췄다. 특히 챗GPT 사용 중 생기는 궁금증이나 보안 관련 문의에 빠르게 대응할 수 있도록 전용 지원 채널을 상시 운영하며, 구성원들이 AI를 자연스럽게 활용할 수 있는 환경을 조성하고 있다.\n또한 팀원들이 AI를 보다 심화된 방식으로 활용할 수 있도록 ‘LLM 공작소’ 프로그램도 운영 중이다. 팀별로 AI를 활용해 해결하고자 하는 과제가 있으면, 사내 LLM 전문가가 함께 참여해 적용 가능 사례를 제안하고 구체적인 구현 방식까지 설계해보는 형태로 진행된다. 이를 통해 토스는 팀원들이 AI를 비즈니스 성과로 연결하는 역량까지 갖출 수 있도록 지원한다.\n보안 측면에서도 체계적인 가이드라인과 기술적 통제 장치를 함께 구축했다. 토스가 도입한 챗GPT ‘엔터프라이즈 플랜’은 기본적으로 사용자의 입력 정보를 학습에 활용하지 않으며, 강력하고 세밀한 권한 관리 및 모니터링 기능을 갖춰 더욱 안전하게 AI를 활용할 수 있도록 설계되어 있다. 여기에 더해 토스는 ▲소스코드, ▲인프라 정보, ▲고객 개인정보, ▲API 키 등 주요 민감 정보의 입력을 금지하고 있다. 입력이 감지될 경우 실시간으로 자동 탐지되며, 관련 팀원에게 즉시 사유 확인 절차가 진행된다.\n특히 토스앱 혹은 토스 팀원들이 사용하는 망분리된 내부 시스템과 챗GPT의 직접 연동은 금지되며, 금융위원회의 혁신금융서비스(금융규제 샌드박스) 지정 항목에 한해 제한적으로 허용된다. 현재 연동 가능한 항목은 ▲코드 자동 문서화, ▲광고 소재 검수, ▲다국어 번역 기능, ▲상품 카테고리 예측 등 14개 항목에 한정된다.\n토스 관계자는 “챗GPT 유료 계정 도입은 AI 퍼스트 조직으로 나아가는 전환점”이라며 “AI 에이전트를 활용해 혁신에 속도를 낼 수 있는 실행 전략을 마련해 나갈 계획”이라고 전했다.",

DSR 3단계 시행 전 연봉 기준으로 대출 한도가 약 3억 원 정도였고, 이는 LTV 70%로 계산한 4억 2,000만 원보다 더 낮았어요.\n결국 김토스는 규제 전에도 LTV가 아닌 DSR 한도에 따라 최대 3억 원까지만 대출을 받을 수 있었고, 여기에 7월부터 DSR 3단계가 적용되면서 한도가 더 줄어 최대 2억 4,000만 원까지만 대출이 되는 상황인 거죠. 지금까지 한 설명을 표로 요약하면 아래와 같아요. \n\n\n2️⃣ 고소득자, 박토스\n\n\n연봉: 1억 원\n목표 주택: 규제 지역(강남, 서초, 반포 등) 12억 원 아파트 \n주택 보유 여부: X \n\n\n고소득 생애 최초 주택 구매자라면 어떨까요? 박토스는 연봉 1억 원을 받는 고소득 직장인으로, 강남·서초·반포 등 규제 지역에 있는 12억 원대 아파트를 구매하려고 합니다. 6.27 부동산 대책 전에는 집 값의 최대 80%까지 대출 가능했지만, 규제 후에는 70%만 가능해졌고, 이마저도 대출 한도가 6억 원으로 제한되었어요.\n결과적으로 규제 전에는 약 2.4억 원만 자기 자금으로 준비하면 됐지만, 규제 이후에는 최소 6억 원 이상이 필요해진 거죠. 그런데 여기에 DSR 3단계 규제까지 더해지면서, 실제로 받을 수 있는 대출 금액은 6억 원보다 더 낮아졌고, 그만큼 자기부담금도 더 늘어나게 되었어요.\n종합하면 박토스는 LTV와 DSR 두 가지 규제 모두 강화된 상황에서 대출 한도가 크게 줄어 내 집 마련 계획에 차질이 생기게 되었어요.\n\n3️⃣ 지방 거주자, 이토스\n\n\n연봉: 1억 원 \n목표 주택: 수도권 외 지역 12억 원 아파트  \n주택 보유 여부: X \n\n\n만약 박토스와 동일한 조건인데 주택을 구매하려는 지역이 비규제 지역이라면, 대출 한도는 어떻게 될까요? 이토스는 수도권 외 지역에 거주하는 연소득 1억 원의 직장인으로, 생애 첫 주택 구매를 위해 12억 원 아파트를 알아보고 있어요. 비규제 지역이자 생애 최초 주택 구매자이기 때문에, 6.27 부동산 대책 이후에도 여전히 LTV는 최대 80%까지 적용 받을 수 있습니다. 이 경우 이론상 9억 6,000만 원까지 대출이 가능하고, 자기부담금은 2억 4,000만 원이면 구매할 수 있는 거죠.\n그런데 대출을 언제 받느냐에 따라 상황은 완전히 달라집니다. \n지방 주택담보대출은 2025년 말까지 규제 3단계가 유예되어, 기존 수준인 0.75%p만 추가하는 완화 조치가 적용됩니다. 만약 이토스가 2025년 하반기에 대출을 받는다면, 연봉 1억 원 기준으로 약 5억 원까지 대출이 가능할 것으로 보입니다. 이 경우 자기부담금으로는 7억 원 정도가 되죠. \n하지만 2026년부터는 스트레스 금리가 +1.5%p로 올라가게 됩니다. 이 때문에 같은 조건이라도 대출 가능액은 4~4억 2,000만 원 수준으로 줄고, 자기부담금은 최대 8억 원까지 늘어나는 셈이에요. 결론적으로는 지방 거주자의 경우 대출 타이밍이 핵심이라는 뜻이에요. 위 내용을 표로 다시 정리하면 이렇습니다. \n\n그래서 나는 \n정확히 얼마까지 빌릴 수 있을까?\n여기까지의 사례와 정리된 대책 내용을 읽고 나면, 결국 가장 궁금한 건 ‘나는 얼마까지 빌릴 수 있지?’일 거예요. 더 구체적으로는 ‘LTV 70% vs DSR 40% vs 6억 상한선 중 어떤 기준이 나의 대출 한도를 많이 줄일지, DSR 3단계가 적용되면 대출이 얼마나 더 줄어들지, 정책대출 받으면 조건이 달라질지’ 등 나의 상황에 맞는 최적의 대출 현황이 궁금해지죠. \n하지만 매번 바뀌는 규제에 맞춰 일일이 계산하기엔 너무 복잡해요. 토스에서는 복잡한 규제 변화를 모두 반영해서, 내 상황에서 실제로 받을 수 있는 정확한 한도를 보여주는데요. 77개 금융사 조건을 한눈에 비교할 수 있고, 6.27 부동산 대책이나 DSR 3단계처럼 복잡한 규제를 직접 계산할 필요 없이, 토스에서 내 상황에 맞는 정확한 답을 찾을 수 있어요.\n이런 내용을 미리 알아둔다면, 좋은 기회가 왔을 때 빠르게 움직일 수 있어요. 복잡한 규제 속에서도 내 집 마련의 꿈, 새로운 전략으로 다시 시작해보세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 유서진 Graphic 조수희 이제현",
