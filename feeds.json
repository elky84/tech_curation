        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/research/2025/04/kotlinxfuzz-kotlin-fuzzing/",
        "pubDate": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 13:55:24 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Identifying edge cases for testing can be a challenging task, often leaving hidden bugs and vulnerabilities undetected. Fuzz testing (fuzzing) addresses this challenge by automatically generating tests with random or invalid inputs, enabling developers to uncover unexpected exceptions and failure scenarios. Thanks to its effectiveness in detecting critical software flaws, fuzzing has gained widespread use across various programming languages. However, it remains relatively underutilized in Kotlin. This is why our Programming Languages and Program Analysis Lab at JetBrains Research has dedicated its efforts to developing kotlinx.fuzz, a fuzzer for Kotlin libraries. Since Kotlin compiles to JVM bytecode, fuzz testing systems for Kotlin can be built using existing Java fuzzers. This concept is the foundation of our current prototype.\nWhy fuzz testing matters\nFuzz testing is a powerful technique capable of exposing undetected errors and vulnerabilities. Research has shown it to be highly effective in detecting critical software flaws. Google’s OSS-Fuzz has discovered over 40,000 bugs in open-source projects, while studies like these highlight how coverage-guided fuzzing significantly enhances bug detection in large-scale systems.\nDespite its success in other ecosystems (like C/C++ and Rust), fuzzing has not seen wide adoption in Kotlin development. Our goal with kotlinx.fuzz is to bridge this gap by introducing an efficient and scalable fuzzing framework specifically designed for Kotlin projects.\nIn this blog post, we start with an illustration of fuzz testing with kotlinx.fuzz, followed by an explanation of how it works and a few examples of what we were able to achieve using it. Then we’ll cover our plans for the future and ways you can contribute.\nFuzz testing with kotlinx.fuzz\nLet’s start with an example from the Kotlin standard library to showcase what fuzz testing your code with kotlinx.fuzz might look like and walk through all the steps it involves.\nAnalyze code \nBefore you begin fuzz testing, you should decide what it is that you want to fuzz. Fuzzing every single function in your program is not very efficient because it requires a lot of time and effort when analyzing the bugs. You’re better off selecting a few target functions that will be the main entry points for the fuzzer and starting with the functions that you expect to be used most frequently. Let’s say we want to fuzz test the Duration class from the Kotlin standard library, focusing on the parseIsoStringOrNull method. It is designed to parse a time duration from a string in the ISO-8601 format. If the string represents a valid time, it returns a Duration instance. Otherwise, it returns null. Let’s write a fuzz test that checks its correctness!\nDesign a fuzz test\nAfter you select a target that you want to test, the next step is to decide how you are going to fuzz it. You need to decide what scenarios you want to test and how to generate all of the necessary data using a fuzzer. In our example, parseIsoStringOrNull just takes a string in an ISO format. Let’s start from the simplest case and write a fuzz test that generates a random string and passes it to the target:\n@KFuzzTest\nfun testDuration(f: KFuzzer) {\n    val isoString = f.asciiString(10)\n    val duration = Duration.parseIsoStringOrNull(isoString)\n    println(\"$isoString -> $duration\")\n}\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, our fuzz test looks very similar to a usual unit test. However, instead of working with the fixed set of input data that the developer manually encodes, we take a Fuzzer as an argument and generate input data with its help. We can then use the fuzzer to re-run this test many times, each time slightly tweaking the value returned by the asciiString call.\nChoose an oracle\nAfter creating this test, you can run it for some time and manually analyze the results. However, these results take a lot of effort to read through and make sense of. To fully leverage the power of fuzzing, you need to come up with an oracle – a way to automatically check if the execution result is correct. An oracle can be as simple or as complicated as you want, however, the quality of the oracle decides what types of bugs you will be able to find. The simplest oracle is just an exception – you can test that your program does not throw any unexpected exceptions. In some cases, you can also perform more complicated checks. For example, if you are fuzzing a JSON parsing library, you can do an inverse check: toJSON(fromJSON(string)) == string. In our example, we can use the Java standard library, which has a method with exactly the same functionality (at least, according to the documentation). This is what our final fuzz test looks like:\n@KFuzzTest\nfun testDuration(f: KFuzzer) {\n    val isoString = f.asciiString(10)\n    val duration = Duration.parseIsoStringOrNull(isoString)\n\n    val javaDuration = try {\n        java.time.Duration.parse(isoString)\n    } catch (_: Throwable) { null }\n\n    assertEquals(javaDuration?.toKotlinDuration(), duration)\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis will help us ensure that the behavior of the Kotlin and the Java function are the same, find all of the mismatches, and analyze why they occur.\nConfigure and run the tests\nBefore you run the test, there are some things that you may want to configure. For example, you can indicate what parts of your project the fuzzer should target, how long you want to run fuzz tests, and where and how it should store the results. Here is an example of a simple configuration:\nfuzzConfig {\n    instrument = listOf(\"kotlin.time.**\")\n    maxFuzzTimePerTarget = 10.minutes\n    coverage {\n        reportTypes = setOf(CoverageReportType.HTML, CoverageReportType.CSV)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nCheck out our documentation for more details on the possible configurations.\nNow you can finally start the fuzz test:\n~/example » ./gradlew fuzz\nAnalyze the results\nAfter the fuzzer finishes, you can focus on analyzing the results and see what bugs were detected. There are two main results that we recommend focusing on:\nCoverage. build/fuzz/jacoco-report will contain JaCoCo coverage reports in the configured formats. We recommend analyzing the coverage to understand if the fuzzer was able to cover all of the parts of your program that you wanted to test. \nBugs. build/fuzz/reproducers will contain all of the crashes found by the fuzzer. You can analyze them by running the fuzzer in regression mode (./gradlew regression). Additionally, you can debug each crash by running your fuzz test in an IDE.\nIn our example test, running it for just 30 minutes covers a large portion of the parseIsoStringOrNull method and gives us a few interesting results:\nJava correctly parses \"Pt+0,s\" into an empty duration, while Kotlin fails.\nConversely, Kotlin correctly parses \"PT+-2H\" into negative 2 hours, while Java fails.\nNaturally, we reported the bugs we’ve found so they could be fixed!\nThis example showcases that even if your library passes all unit and integration tests, fuzzing can reveal subtle parsing errors, unexpected crashes, or corner cases you never thought of, helping you ship more reliable software. Even this simple fuzz test was able to find two edge cases that highlighted issues in both the Kotlin and Java standard libraries.\nWhat kotlinx.fuzz provides\nWe launched the kotlinx.fuzz project to explore the applicability of fuzzing for detecting bugs in Kotlin programs. By building our system on top of an existing Java fuzzer, Jazzer, we were able to leverage a tool already capable of fuzzing and finding bugs in JVM programs, and thus in Kotlin programs as well. However, as a standalone tool, it has some limitations that may impede its adoption for fuzz testing in Kotlin. \nJazzer’s main limitations are related to the user experience. In our opinion, while it provides a good foundation, Jazzer is inconvenient to run, configure, and analyze results. It provides a basic command-line interface and a limited integration with JUnit. Additionally, it sometimes falls short when working with Kotlin. For example, it fails to correctly collect coverage for certain Kotlin-specific features and fails to consider nullability when working in auto-fuzz mode. Thus, we decided to focus on Jazzer’s strengths and develop a new infrastructure around it to overcome its weaknesses.\nIn the kotlinx.fuzz system, we addressed the key issues by providing additional features:\nAn intuitive API for writing fuzz tests in Kotlin (showcased above).\nA Gradle plugin that allows configuring and running fuzz tests easily.\nA custom JUnit engine for easy IDE integration.\n\n\n\n\nBugs that kotlinx.fuzz helped us find\nUsing our system, we analyzed several Kotlinx libraries and discovered a number of interesting bugs and insights. Extensive fuzzing experiments on libraries such as kotlinx.serialization and kotlinx.collections.immutable allowed us to uncover several non-trivial errors, including: \nStack overflow in kotlinx.serialization.cbor, which is an error in the decoding of concise binary object representation that leads to infinite recursion, causing a stack overflow.\nPersistent ordered sets equality in kotlinx.collections.immutable, a bug in persistent set operations where removing elements leads to inconsistent results.\nInvalid serialization in kotlinx.serialization.json, in which setting classDiscriminator to an existing JSON name causes an undetected name conflict, resulting in incorrect serialization.\nIf you are interested in more details, check out all of our findings on our Trophy List page.\nWhat’s next for kotlinx.fuzz\nHaving successfully addressed several key usability issues, we will continue improving kotlinx.fuzz and enhancing the overall user experience. Our goal is to provide greater user control over fuzz test reporting and configurability for individual tests.\nOur development is now focusing on introducing major new features to extend the functionality of our fuzzer. First, we aim to develop a feature that generates regular tests based on crashes and failures detected by the fuzzer. Second, we plan to implement more powerful crash deduplication mechanisms that can group errors by their underlying causes. Finally, we intend to create a new, Kotlin-specific tool for automatic fuzz test generation, enabling users to harness the power of fuzzing with minimal manual input while also allowing for more user control.\nHow you can use fuzz testing in your Kotlin project\nWe believe that fuzz testing can be a powerful tool in detecting bugs and vulnerabilities in your codebase. We invite Kotlin developers and library maintainers to try out kotlinx.fuzz, provide feedback, and contribute to its development. Our GitHub repository can help you get started, and we will be happy to receive your comments and feedback. Your insights can help us make fuzz testing a staple in Kotlin development!",

That’s why we’ve introduced two new AI-powered features in the JetBrains Academy plugin to help you stay focused, confident, and in the flow: Machine Translation and Theory Lookup.\nUnlike generic AI coding features, these tools were thoughtfully designed by our educational research team to support the real needs of learners. The goal isn’t just to generate answers, but to help you develop the deep understanding essential for today’s developers.\nTo explore the latest improvements, install the JetBrains Academy plugin or update to the latest version from Settings (Preferences for macOS) | Plugins in your JetBrains ID\nINSTALL FREE PLUGIN\n                                                    \nMachine Translation: learn in your language\nReading in your non-native language can make learning unnecessarily difficult. With Machine Translation, you can now automatically translate task titles and descriptions in any in-IDE course into one of 10 supported languages: Spanish, Portuguese, French, Russian, German, Polish, Korean, Turkish, and both Simplified and Traditional Chinese.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Machine Translation feature: \nIt’s available for theory tasks while code samples remain untouched.\nMachine Translation is powered by JetBrains Grazie.\nYou can enable it per course or apply it to all courses via the plugin settings.\n\n\n\n\nThis way, you can focus on the logic of your code, not the grammar of the description.\nTheory Lookup: inline term definitions for theory tasks\nHave you ever stumbled on a term in a task and had to Google it mid-session? With Theory Lookup, there’s no need to leave your IDE. Key programming terms in theory tasks are now highlighted with quick definitions, powered by Grazie.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what you need to know about the Theory Lookup feature:\nHover over a term to see its meaning in simple language.\nIt’s available for all in-IDE courses in English. \nIt’s only active in theory tasks.\nIt can be turned off in the settings if needed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTheory Lookup is your handy built-in programming glossary.\nWhy it matters\nThese features were designed to eliminate friction in the learning process – especially when tasks feel overwhelming or unclear. Whether it’s language barriers or complex concepts, Machine Translation and Theory Lookup help you stay focused and make steady progress without context switching.\nTry it today\nThe Machine Translation and Theory Lookup features are available in the latest version of the JetBrains Academy plugin 2025.3 for all JetBrains Academy courses. No setup is required – just update your plugin and start learning.\n\n\n\n\nHappy learning!\nThe JetBrains Academy team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TeamCity is introducing a batch of UX/UI improvements and more in its upcoming release.\nWith the December release of TeamCity 2024.12, we updated the main navigation and breadcrumb trail. Now, we’re excited to introduce the Settings view and updated page headers, making managing your projects and builds easier.\nBy observing how people use TeamCity and talking to them, we discovered a common struggle – new users often get stuck when creating projects. Many resort to copy-pasting just to get through the setup, and frustration with navigation only adds to the challenge.\nThe new design is all about fixing these pain points and making the experience smoother and more intuitive. Here are the main changes:\nA new left-hand navigation panel improves access to key TeamCity sections, adds consistency, and reduces clicks, resulting in a faster workflow.\nA redesigned breadcrumb trail improves clarity by showing the current location and enhancing navigation with visible controls.\nNew page headers add structural clarity and navigation with a structured layout, clearer status, a Settings button, and interactive elements for key actions.\nThe new Settings view improves navigation in TeamCity by providing a consistent layout, allowing users to keep the Settings view open while moving through the project tree, and making settings easier to compare.\nHundreds of thousands of teams rely on TeamCity daily to handle their CI/CD process. We know that even small changes can impact your workflow, so we’ve designed every update to be valuable and seamless. Whether handling a single build or managing multiple projects, the new TeamCity experience aims to improve your work.\nWe hope the revamped TeamCity enhances your productivity. Now, let’s dive into the new design.\nSide navigation to streamline your work\nAccess key TeamCity elements from the left-hand panel\nEverything previously found in the TeamCity main menu at the top of the page has moved to a new panel on the left-hand side. Dedicated pages like Agents and Queue are now supplemented with relevant details.\n\n\n\n\nNew breadcrumb trail \nRevealing hidden features and creating transparency in navigation\nWith the new design, we’ve added a final breadcrumb element for better clarity and introduced a visible control for easier project tree navigation.\n\n\n\n\nPage headers\nOptimized headers for a clearer overview\nThe new header design enhances usability by providing a clearer visual hierarchy, making key information like build status, duration, and test results instantly accessible. Each widget’s interactive elements allow quicker actions, reducing the need for extra clicks.\n\n\n\n\nSettings view\n“I guide myself by going through the build steps that I created for the last project and see if I can apply them to the current project, so let’s get a second tab.”\n– Michael Backmann, TeamCity user, Customer Journey map study provided by the Market Research and Analytics team\nThe new Settings view improves navigation and efficiency by allowing users to keep settings open while moving through the project tree. This makes it easier to compare configurations and make adjustments seamlessly.\nThe addition of a project sidebar enables fast switching between projects, while the tab layout on the build configuration keeps you focused and allows space for future designs (stay tuned!). To further enhance usability, project settings are now grouped into logical clusters, making it easier to find specific elements quickly.\nThis structured approach reduces search time, improves clarity, and ensures a smoother workflow. Together, these improvements streamline workflows, reduce friction, and provide a more intuitive editing experience in TeamCity.\n\n\n\n\nMore changes to come this summer\nThere are many more changes to come! We’re adding a visual pipeline editor to TeamCity. This means you’ll be able to configure your builds visually (think drag-and-drop). \nThere will also be a new creation flow that enables creating from used VCS roots, building configuration templates, and more. Stay tuned for more changes, and please share your feedback so we can shape the product together!\n\n\n\n\nLet’s shape the future of TeamCity together\nWe’re excited for you to get your hands on the new TeamCity and can’t wait to hear your thoughts. Please feel free to share them here in the comments, and don’t hesitate to contact our Support team if you have any questions. We’re always here to help!",

In this blog post, I’ll explain how to configure your Windows machine for C/C++ development with Bazel, import a Bazel project into CLion, and set up a custom toolchain using LLVM as an example.\nWhat is Bazel and why is it popular in C/C++?\nBazel is an extensible open-source build tool developed by Google that is designed to handle projects of any size. It provides fast and reproducible builds for almost any language, while also offering dependency management and incremental builds. \nBazel is particularly popular for C and C++, as it addresses many of the challenges commonly associated with C/C++ development. Its advanced caching can minimize rebuild times by compiling only what has changed, while remote caching and distributed execution allow developers to leverage multiple machines for faster, more efficient development.\nDOWNLOAD CLION’S BAZEL PLUGIN\nWindows support\nThe latest version of CLion’s Bazel plugin finally features official support for Windows and compatibility with MSVC toolchains. This means you are now able to take full advantage of Bazel’s powerful capabilities directly within CLion.\nGetting started\nTo help you get started, we have put together a quick guide on how to configure your Windows machine for C and C++ development with Bazel. For more details, you can check the official guide provided by Bazel.\n1. Install Bazelisk\nBazelisk is a user-friendly wrapper for Bazel that automatically manages Bazel versions for your projects. It ensures you’re always using the correct version without manual upgrades.\nDownload the latest Bazelisk executable for Windows from Bazelisk Releases on GitHub. Add the downloaded executable to your system’s PATH to make it accessible from the command line. You can also rename the Bazelisk binary to bazel, since it forwards all command line options to Bazel itself.\n2. Install MSYS2\nBazel requires a Unix-like environment on Windows for some of its features. MSYS2 provides this environment.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install MSYS2. Head to the MSYS2 website and follow the installation instructions.\n\n\n\n\nInstall the required tools. MSYS2 by default does not include all tools required for Bazel. To install the missing tools, open the MSYS2 terminal after installation and run the following command: pacman -S zip unzip patch diffutils git.\n\n\n\n\nSet the BAZEL_SH environment variable. Bazel needs to know where to find the MSYS2 shell. Set the BAZEL_SH environment variable to: <INSTALLATION_PATH>\\usr\\bin\\bash.exe. Replace the <INSTALLATION_PATH> with the actual path where MSYS2 is installed, such as C:\\msys64.\n3. Install Visual Studio\nTo build C and C++ projects with Bazel, you’ll first need to install Visual Studio Build Tools. These tools come bundled with Visual Studio.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall Visual Studio. Download and install Visual Studio from the official website. During installation, select the C++ development workload to ensure the necessary components are installed.\n\n\n\n\nSet the BAZEL_VC environment variable. Bazel also needs to know the location of your Visual Studio installation. Set the BAZEL_VC environment variable to the Visual Studio installation path as follows: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\VC. The path might be different for you depending on what Visual Studio version you installed.\nAfter installing and configuring Bazel on your Windows machine, following a few best practices can help you avoid common pitfalls. Here are some tips to ensure a smooth and efficient development experience.  For more details, refer to the official Bazel configuration guide.\nTip 1: Long path issues\nSome applications on Windows have a maximum path length limitation, which can impact tools like the MSVC compiler. You can try to mitigate these issues by taking the following steps:\nUse a short output directory. Configure Bazel to use a shorter output path by adding the following line to your .bazelrc file: startup --output_user_root=C:/tmp.\n\n\n\n\nEnable 8.3 filename support. Bazel itself can also shorten long paths when 8.3 filename support is enabled. Ensure this feature is enabled for the volume your project is stored on. You can enable 8.3 filename support for all volumes by running the following command: fsutil 8dot3name set 0.\nTip 2: Enable symlinks\nCertain Bazel features, such as handling runfiles, require symlink support on Windows. Follow these steps to enable symlink support:\nEnable developer mode. To use symlinks on Windows without elevated permissions, developer mode has to be enabled. Follow the Microsoft guide to enable this mode on your system.\n\n\n\n\nEnable symlink support. Add the following lines to your .bazelrc file to enable symlink functionality in Bazel:\nstartup --windows_enable_symlinks\n\nbuild --enable_runfiles\nImporting a project\nImporting a Bazel project into CLion on Windows works the same way as it does on Linux and macOS. However, before proceeding, ensure that your project builds successfully on Windows, as this is essential for the import process to work correctly. If you’re new to the Bazel plugin, the simplest way to import a project is to just open the root directory in CLion. To do this, choose the Open option on the CLion welcome screen and select the root directory of your project.\n\n\n\n\nAfter opening the project, CLion will import it for you. This process is referred to as synchronizing the project, since CLion analyzes the contents of your BUILD files and automatically configures the project accordingly. If you make any changes to your BUILD files, you need to re-sync your project by pressing the Bazel heart in the top right-hand corner.\n\n\n\n\nWhat parts of your project are loaded by CLion can be configured in the project view file. By default, the Bazel plugin creates the .clwb/.bazelproject file that simply imports the entire project. For additional customization details, consult the Bazel plugin documentation.\nCustom toolchains\nFor a while, the CLion Bazel plugin was primarily designed to work with the default local C and C++ toolchain. However, with the growing need to fully support Bazel on Windows, adding compatibility for MSVC became a priority. We took this opportunity to refine the plugin’s toolchain support in general. As a result, the CLion Bazel plugin now includes robust support for custom toolchains, enabling developers to leverage diverse toolchain configurations across platforms.\nCLion supports many popular compilers such as GCC, LLVM, and MSVC, and the flexibility of custom toolchains allows you to integrate any of these compilers into your setup. Furthermore, since Bazel isn’t limited to the mentioned compilers, the update makes cross-platform development possible for automotive and embedded projects.\nFor example, to use LLVM with Bazel, you can configure it in your MODULE.bazel file as follows:\nbazel_dep(name = \"toolchains_llvm\", version = \"1.3.0\")\n\nllvm = use_extension(\"@toolchains_llvm//toolchain/extensions:llvm.bzl\", \"llvm\")\nllvm.toolchain(\n   llvm_version = \"19.1.0\",\n)\n\nuse_repo(llvm, \"llvm_toolchain\")\nregister_toolchains(\"@llvm_toolchain//:all\")\nFor more details about the LLVM toolchain for Bazel, refer to the toolchains_llvm GitHub repository. \nIf you’re targeting a custom platform, make sure it is included as a build flag within your project view file. Without this, CLion might not be able to resolve all of your includes. For instance, when using the LLVM toolchain to target Wasm, the following section should be added to your project view file.\nbuild_flags:\n  --platforms=@toolchains_llvm//platforms:wasm32\nOnce a custom toolchain like LLVM is set up, CLion automatically detects it and provides tailored code insights, including accurate warnings and inspections, advanced code highlighting, and support for toolchain-specific features. \n\n\n\n\nCLion’s new support for custom toolchain resolution is also essential for the support of future Bazel versions, considering the Bazel team’s plans to deprecate the default toolchain. Furthermore, it is already recommended to define a custom toolchain in your BUILD files to ensure hermeticity and reproducibility for your builds.\nConclusion\nLooking to the future, we’re excited to begin evaluating the possibility of integrating CLion with Bazel transitions. However, if you have any other features you’d like to see supported in the Bazel for CLion plugin, feel free to share them in the comments, and we’ll be happy to follow up.\nDOWNLOAD CLION’S BAZEL PLUGIN",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This tutorial was brought to you by Rajkumar Venkatasamy, draft.dev.\nMicroservice architecture has become a cornerstone for building scalable and maintainable applications. Microservices allow individual services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, resulting in faster delivery cycles and improved fault isolation. \nFor example, an e-commerce platform can use independent services to handle product catalogs, user authentication, and order management. By breaking large applications into smaller, independent services, organizations can address challenges such as long development cycles, difficulty in scaling specific components, and the risk of a single failure affecting the entire application.\nIn enterprise applications, microservices make it easier to quickly update and scale specific parts of the system. This allows teams to improve features without affecting the entire application. Automated testing and deployment of service components increase reliability, catching potential issues early and maintaining system stability. \n💡See also: CI/CD and Serverless Computing: Best Practices for Microservices\nMicroservices also streamline the DevOps workflow, allowing for faster time-to-market by reducing the complexity of deployments and leveraging continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These pipelines play a critical role in managing the lifecycle of microservices from development to deployment, ensuring consistent and efficient delivery processes.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to create a microservice using Spring Boot, set up a CI/CD pipeline with JetBrains TeamCity, and automate deployment using Docker.\nMicroservice overview and prerequisites\nImagine you’re developing an inventory management system where each microservice handles a specific function, such as managing products, orders, or customers. In this tutorial, you’ll build a “Product Service” microservice that provides RESTful APIs to create and list products.\nArchitecture diagram\n\n\n\nYou’ll need the following to complete this tutorial:\nExposure to Java programming and JDK 21 or higher.\nFamiliarity with Spring Boot, particularly using Spring Initializr for generating and working with Spring Boot projects.\nTeamCity. This tutorial uses the on-premises version of TeamCity running on a Windows machine as a Windows service. However, you can use whichever TeamCity version you prefer.\nGit.\nA GitHub account.\nDocker Desktop.\nA Docker Hub account and a repository to pull or push the Docker image you’ll build as part of this tutorial.\nSet up a new GitHub repo\nCreate an empty repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine using this command:\ngit clone <your GitHub repository path>\nYou’ll use this GitHub repository later while setting up the build pipeline in TeamCity.\nGenerate a Java Spring Boot project\nOpen a browser and paste the following preconfigured URL to load the Spring Boot project in the browser:\nhttps://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.4.1&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=21&groupId=com.example&artifactId=demo&name=demo&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.demo&dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2\nYou’ll be directed to the Spring Initializr dashboard:\nSpring Initializr\n\n\n\nClick GENERATE to download the Spring Boot project. Extract the project in the directory where you cloned your GitHub repository. Then, open the project in your favorite IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA) and edit the pom.xml file to include the following dependency:\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>\n   <artifactId>mockito-core</artifactId>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nAdd the following plugin in the same pom.xml file:\n<plugin>\n   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n   <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>\n   <configuration>\n      <argLine>-javaagent:${settings.localRepository}/org/mockito/mockito-core/5.14.2/mockito-core-5.14.2.jar</argLine>\n   </configuration>\n</plugin>\nThe above changes need to be done in your pom.xml file to bring in the Mockito library, which enables you to use mocking in your unit tests. <scope>test</scope> ensures that Mockito is only used during testing and not included in the final application build, as it’s not required while the application is run.\nIf you want to explore the pom.xml file in its entirety or reference the source code of this tutorial, you can visit this GitHub repository.\nImplement a RESTful API for the product service\nWhen complete, the demo application will have two APIs: one that allows the user to create a product and one that will fetch the created products.\nCreate a product entity class\nBegin by creating an entity class called product.java inside the com.example.demo package under the src directory. This entity class maps the product information to the underlying table definition:\npackage com.example.demo;\n\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GenerationType;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\n\n@Entity\npublic class Product {\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\n    private Long id;\n    private String name;\n    private double price;\n\n    public Product(Long id, String name, double price) {\n        this.id = id;\n        this.name = name;\n        this.price = price;\n    }\n\n    public Product() {\n    }\n\n    // Getters and setters\n\n    public Long getId() {\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    public void setId(Long id) {\n        this.id = id;\n    }\n\n    public String getName() {\n        return name;\n    }\n\n    public void setName(String name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n    public double getPrice() {\n        return price;\n    }\n\n    public void setPrice(double price) {\n        this.price = price;\n    }\n}\nThe @Entity annotation indicates that this is an entity class and is referring to a database table. The @Id annotation indicates the primary key of the product entity and @GeneratedValue holds the technique by which the values of the primary keys will be generated.\nCreate a product repository class\nNext, create a product repository class called ProductRepository.java in the same com.example.demo package. You’ll need the repository class to store, manipulate, and retrieve the persisted product information from the underlying table. The @Repository Spring annotation helps you achieve this:\npackage com.example.demo;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;\n\n@Repository\npublic interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product, Long> {}\nCreate a product controller class\nCreate a ProductController.java class inside the same com.example.demo package. Below is the source code for the controller class file, which includes the @Autowired product repository class and calls the methods that create or fetch product information in their respective APIs:\npackage com.example.demo;\n\n\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\n@RestController\n@RequestMapping(\"/products\")\npublic class ProductController {\n    @Autowired\n    private ProductRepository repository;\n\n    @GetMapping\n    public List<Product> getAllProducts() {\n        return repository.findAll();\n    }\n\n    @PostMapping\n    public Product createProduct(@RequestBody Product product) {\n        return repository.save(product);\n    }\n}\nThat’s all for the core application logic.\nCreate a test class\nThe next step is to create a test class to test the API methods defined in the controller class.\nCreate a test class named ProductControllerTest.java under the test directory and within the package com.example.demo. Paste in the following code, which contains the logic to test the product creation and retrieval methods:\npackage com.example.demo;\n\nimport com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.mockito.Mockito;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.WebMvcTest;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;\nimport org.springframework.http.MediaType;\nimport org.springframework.test.context.ContextConfiguration;\nimport org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport static org.mockito.ArgumentMatchers.any;\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders.*;\nimport static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.*;\n\n@WebMvcTest(ProductController.class)\n@ContextConfiguration(classes = {ProductController.class, ProductControllerTest.TestConfig.class})\nclass ProductControllerTest {\n\n        @Autowired\n        private MockMvc mockMvc;\n\n        @Autowired\n        private ProductRepository repository;\n\n        @Autowired\n        private ObjectMapper objectMapper;\n\n        @BeforeEach\n        void setUp() {\n                Mockito.reset(repository);\n        }\n\n        @Test\n        void getAllProducts_ShouldReturnProductList() throws Exception {\n                // Arrange\n                List<Product> products = Arrays.asList(\n                        new Product(1L, \"Product1\", 100.0),\n                        new Product(2L, \"Product2\", 200.0)\n                );\n                Mockito.when(repository.findAll()).thenReturn(products);\n\n                // Act & Assert\n                mockMvc.perform(get(\"/products\"))\n                        .andExpect(status().isOk())\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.length()\").value(2))\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$[0].name\").value(\"Product1\"))\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$[1].name\").value(\"Product2\"));\n        }\n\n        @Test\n        void createProduct_ShouldReturnSavedProduct() throws Exception {\n                // Arrange\n                Product product = new Product(1L, \"NewProduct\", 150.0);\n                Mockito.when(repository.save(any(Product.class))).thenReturn(product);\n\n                // Act & Assert\n                mockMvc.perform(post(\"/products\")\n                                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n                                .content(objectMapper.writeValueAsString(product)))\n                        .andExpect(status().isOk())\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.id\").value(1))\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.name\").value(\"NewProduct\"))\n                        .andExpect(jsonPath(\"$.price\").value(150.0));\n        }\n\n        @Configuration\n        static class TestConfig {\n                @Bean\n                public ProductRepository productRepository() {\n                        return Mockito.mock(ProductRepository.class);\n                }\n        }\n}\nBuild the application\nNow that the application source code is ready, open a terminal and switch to the project directory containing the entire application code. Execute the following command to compile and build the application:\nmvnw clean install\nYou should see an output similar to the following, indicating that the build has started and completed successfully:\n[INFO] Scanning for projects...\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --------------------------< com.example:demo >--------------------------\n[INFO] Building demo 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT\n[INFO]   from pom.xml\n[INFO] --------------------------------[ jar ]---------------------------------\n[INFO] \n[INFO] --- clean:3.4.0:clean (default-clean) @ demo —\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[INFO] Total time:  9.064 s\n[INFO] Finished at: 2025-01-05T10:57:04+05:30\n[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTest the APIs locally\nYou can test the APIs locally using any of your favorite API testing tools. To test the product creation, make a POST request to the products endpoint at http://localhost:8080/products with the following request body:\n{\n    \"name\": \"product-1\",\n    \"price\": 14.20\n}\n\nYou should get this JSON response:\n{\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"product-1\",\n    \"price\": 14.2\n}\n\nYou can make another similar POST request with the request body below to create another product:\n{\n    \"name\": \"product-2\",\n    \"price\": 20\n}\nNext, test the product information retrieval API by making a GET request to the products endpoint at http://localhost:8080/products. You should see a response body with the details of the product information created earlier:\n[\n    {\n        \"id\": 1,\n        \"name\": \"product-1\",\n        \"price\": 14.2\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": 2,\n        \"name\": \"product-2\",\n        \"price\": 20.0\n    }\n]\nPush the project code to your GitHub repository\nTo set up a CI/CD pipeline for your product microservice with TeamCity, you need to push your project source code into a version control repository like GitHub. Commit and push your changes to your GitHub repo by executing the following command from a terminal opened in the project directory:\ngit add .\ngit commit -am \"initial commit\"\ngit push\nYou’ve now tested your application locally and pushed the source code to GitHub.\nCreate a project in TeamCity\nLet’s move on to integrating your application with TeamCity.\nFirst, ensure that both the TeamCity server and agent services are running. If you’re using Windows, you can execute the following command in a PowerShell terminal:\nGet-Service -Name \"TeamCity\"\nYou should see this output:\nStatus   Name               DisplayName\n------   ----               -----------\nRunning  TeamCity           TeamCity Server\nExecute the following command:\nGet-Service -Name \"*BuildAgent*\"\nYou should see this output:\nStatus   Name               DisplayName\n------   ----               -----------\nRunning  TCBuildAgent       TeamCity Build Agent\nThen, open a browser and access http://localhost:8111/. Log in to the TeamCity portal with the username and password that you specified when installing TeamCity:\nTeamCity login page\n\n\n\nOnce you’re logged in, click Create project… to create a new project in TeamCity:\nCreate Project form\n\n\n\nOnce the TeamCity server is able to connect with your GitHub repository, you should see a screen indicating the connection to the repository has been verified:\nConnection verified message\n\n\n\nLeave the details as is and click Proceed.\nConfigure build steps\nAfter clicking Proceed, you’ll be redirected to a screen where TeamCity will automatically detect certain build steps based on your project files:\nAuto-detected build steps\n\n\n\nSelect the Docker and Maven build steps as shown below and click Use selected:\nUse selected build steps\n\n\n\nThe selected build steps will be added and displayed on the next screen:\nBuild steps\n\n\n\nClick Edit on the “Maven” build step to view its details. Here, you can enter “Build application using Maven” (or anything else you like) as the step name. Leave all other settings as their default values and click Save:\nMaven build step\n\n\n\nYou should see a message indicating that your build step was successfully updated:\nSuccess message for edited Maven build step\n\n\n\nNext, click Edit for the “Docker” build step. Enter a custom step name (something like “Build Docker Image”) and fill in the Image name:tag field to build the Docker image with the given name and tag. Leave the other default values as they are and click Save:\nDocker build step\n\n\n\nYou should see a message indicating that your build step was successfully updated:\nSuccess message for edited Docker build step\n\n\n\nClick the drop-down menu to the right of the second build step and select Copy build step… to duplicate the step:\nCopy build step\n\n\n\nOn the form that appears, accept the default values shown by clicking Copy:\nPop-up form\n\n\n\nYou should see a message confirming your action was successful:\nSuccess message for copied build step\n\n\n\nNext, edit the newly copied step. Enter a new step name (something like “Push Docker Image”), then select push as the Docker command option to indicate that the image has to be pushed using the docker push command:\nPush Docker Image step\n\n\n\nAfter clicking Save, you should see a message indicating that your edit was successful:\nSuccess message for edited build step\n\n\n\nNext, copy the “Push Docker Image” step by repeating the instructions from earlier:\nSuccess message for copied build step\n\n\n\nClick Edit next to the newly created step. Enter something like “Deploy Docker Image and Run the App” as the step name, then select other as the Docker command option and enter run in the Command name field. For additional arguments for the command, enter --name demo-app -p 8080:8080 -d <your_docker_repository_name>/<your_image_name>:<your_tag_name>.\nDeployment step\n\n\n\nThe deployment step defined above will pull the Docker image from the Docker Hub registry to the target machine (your local machine, in this case) and start the application container.\nAfter you click Save, you should get confirmation that your last edit action was successful.\nNow, click the project name displayed at the top to go to the project details screen:\nClick project name\n\n\n\nClick Connections on the left:\nProject details screen\n\n\n\nClick Add Connection to define a new connection with the details pertaining to your Docker Hub account:\nAdd connection\n\n\n\nThis is a required step to enable the build pipeline to perform Docker-oriented actions that you configured as part of earlier build steps.\nOn the form that appears, select Docker Registry as the connection type, then enter your Docker Hub account credentials:\nDocker registry credentials\n\n\n\nClick Save. You should get confirmation that the connection was successfully created.\nNext, click Go to project page in the top-right hand side of the screen to navigate back to the project page:\nGo to project page\n\n\n\nClick Build:\nProject page\n\n\n\nClick Edit configuration… at the top:\nEdit build configuration\n\n\n\nClick Build Features in the left menu:\nClick Build Features\n\n\n\nClick Add build feature:\nAdd build feature\n\n\n\nSelect Docker Support as the build feature, then click Add registry connection:\nLink registry connection with Docker Support feature\n\n\n\nChoose the configured Docker Registry connection from the drop-down menu, then click Add to link the registry connection.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Good news, everyone! We’re excited to share major progress on ReSharper’s out-of-process implementation, one of our most challenging projects to date.\nFor those of you who’ve been following our journey, asking thoughtful questions, and patiently waiting for updates, we want to let you know how far we’ve come. Your continued support has been invaluable throughout this process.\nTo catch up on our progress, you may want to check out these posts:\nTaking ReSharper out of process\nWhere we are with “out of process” ReSharper\nUpdate on running ReSharper out of process\n“What’s the latest news on ReSharper’s out-of-process?”\nThe Road to Out-of-Process ReSharper: Asynchronous Typing\nAsynchronous typing enabled\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve been using the latest out-of-process (OOP) implementation internally for the past four weeks and are genuinely excited about the results. While not all features are fully supported and there are known issues to address, the core functionality that makes ReSharper essential to your workflow is taking shape. We’re making steady progress toward delivering a more responsive ReSharper experience.\nWhat is OOP and why does it matter?\nPerformance has consistently been the number one piece of feedback we’ve received from our users over the years. Our telemetry and user surveys confirmed what many of you have been telling us: despite ReSharper’s  powerful features, the impact on Visual Studio’s responsiveness was affecting your daily workflow.\nWe’ve tracked multiple metrics related to perceived performance, and having analyzed the data, we realized that incremental optimizations wouldn’t be enough. We needed a fundamental architectural change that could address these core performance concerns while preserving all the productivity features you rely on.\nThis led us down the path of developing our new out-of-process (OOP) architecture. The fundamental goal is straightforward: keep the code that depends on the Visual Studio API within the Visual Studio process while moving ReSharper’s core functionality to a separate process. By moving the computation-heavy components to run in their own process, we’re finally able to dramatically reduce ReSharper’s impact on Visual Studio’s responsiveness. Our measurements show:\nSix times fewer noticeable pauses in the UI thread.\nReSharper’s impact on startup reduced to under a second.\nSignificantly improved typing responsiveness.\n\nHow we made it work\nOne of the greatest challenges of this project was implementing OOP while maintaining backward compatibility with existing features. ReSharper is one of our flagship products used by thousands of developers daily, so we cannot pause support for new language features or platform updates while working on the OOP architecture. We couldn’t simply develop a side product either – we had to perform surgery on a living, beating heart.\nModular architecture for controlled migration\nTo tackle this challenge, we created a system of toggles for each functional area in ReSharper. These toggles determine whether a particular capability runs inside Visual Studio or in the separate ReSharper process.\nThis approach lets us precisely control which parts of ReSharper have moved to the OOP model and which remain in the traditional in-process setup. We can test each component independently, ensure it works correctly in the new environment, and then gradually transition more components as development progresses. As a result, we get to maintain full functionality while systematically building out the OOP architecture.\nAt the same time, we needed a way for both processes to communicate seamlessly. To achieve this, we use RD, our open-source protocol, which acts as a bridge between the two environments. The toggles determine which process each component runs in, while the protocol ensures that both sides stay in sync. Each component follows a shared interface that works in both processes. If a component isn’t available in one of them, a stand-in is automatically created and injected, allowing ReSharper to function as a unified system.\n\n\n\n\nTackling UI pauses\nThe OOP architecture we’ve designed addresses the three main causes of frustrating noticeable UI pauses:\nMain thread bottlenecks: A significant portion of our older codebase is not thread-safe and assumes modifications can only happen on the main thread. This consumes valuable main thread time and reduces the probability of the UI rendering quickly. Moving these operations out of process eliminates this contention.\n\n\n\n\nGlobal content lock contention: ReSharper has historically used one global content reader-writer lock. When random activities hold onto read locks, obtaining a write lock on the main thread creates unpredictable delays. By physically relocating these activities and the content lock itself to a separate process, we can make sure these delays no longer show up in the UI.\n\n\n\n\nGarbage collection overhead: Reducing the amount of work in the Visual Studio process significantly decreases memory traffic, which in turn reduces GC time and associated pauses.\nMeasurable typing latency improvements\nTo quantify the impact of moving ReSharper to OOP mode, we conducted comprehensive performance testing to measure real-world typing responsiveness.\nOur measurements included six different typing tests simulating various developer typing behaviors:\nNoDelayNoOverlap tests rapid typing where each keystroke waits for the previous one to be processed, with no additional delay between keystrokes.\nMinDelayNoOverlap introduces a minimal 1ms pause between inputs while still ensuring each keystroke is fully processed before the next begins, simulating slight hesitations during typing.\nTwo Isochronous tests (Isochronous150 and Isochronous300) create consistent timing patterns with fixed intervals between keystrokes of 150ms and 300ms respectively, representing different steady typing rhythms.\nThe 200Dev100fc2 configuration adds natural variability to typing speed with a 200ms mean delay and 100ms standard deviation.\nFinally, our Realistic test most accurately represents typical developer typing behavior with timing patterns that closely match real-world coding sessions. \nThe results consistently show that out-of-process execution significantly improves typing responsiveness across most scenarios, particularly in realistic typing conditions. In our most realistic typing scenario, median typing latency improved from 26.4ms to 16.7ms, creating a noticeably smoother editing experience.\nBut what does this improvement actually mean for developers in their daily work?\nIn practical terms, this 37% reduction in typing latency translates to a tangibly smoother coding experience. Lower latency means fewer interruptions while you type, keeping you in your flow state longer, especially during uninterrupted stretches of coding.\nThe difference is particularly noticeable when it comes to eliminating those frustrating moments where typing appears to freeze momentarily. We analyzed pauses on the UI thread, focusing on those lasting 100ms or more as our benchmark for disruptions that negatively impact typing flow. By counting these significant pauses across all our measurements, we found that the number of these disruptions has decreased by 600%. The 99th percentile response time dropped dramatically from 316ms in the traditional implementation to just 41ms in out-of-process mode, virtually eliminating the most severe typing interruptions that break concentration.\nWith our latest OOP architecture, you get all the ReSharper features you rely on, but with a much more responsive typing experience. We believe this change makes a real difference to your experience of ReSharper as a productivity enhancer.\nTyping latency comparison across six test scenarios showing Out-of-Process ReSharper (blue graph) consistently outperforming In-Process implementations with 37% lower median latency in realistic typing conditions.\n\n\n\nWhat’s working now\nThe current implementation already supports most of the features you rely on daily, including:\nCore productivity features (navigation, completion, refactorings, code analysis)\nEditor enhancements (typing assistance, parameter info, inlay hints)\nCode maintenance (cleanup, formatting, generation, quick-fixes)\nProject management (solution builder, run configurations, tool windows)\nUnit testing (though debugging tests isn’t yet supported)\nReSharper C++\nKnown issues\nJust as in our previous status update on the OOP journey, we want to maintain complete transparency about the current limitations:\nCompatibility: ReSharper can’t run in OOP mode when dotMemory, dotTrace, or dotCover are installed.\nBroken features that need fixing include:\n\nAI integration\nDebugger features\nDPA\nGrammar and spelling checker \nTemplate editor\nStructural Search and Replace \nRegular expression validation\nDiagramming\nWhat’s next\nWe’re almost there. After years of work and months of internal testing, we’re now just a short distance away from making ReSharper’s OOP mode available for public testing.\nWe’re aiming to share a build with you in a couple of months from now. If you’re eager to try it out, keep an eye on RSRP-480863. That’s where we’ll post updates and announce the preview as soon as it’s ready.\nAcknowledgments\nThis milestone wouldn’t be possible without the remarkable work of several key team members. Special thanks to Alexander Ulitin for spearheading this project, as well as to Sergey Coox, Serge Baltic, Nikita Popov, and Denis Korneev for their essential contributions.\nWe’re excited about this important step toward a more responsive, efficient ReSharper experience. There’s more work ahead, but the light at the end of the tunnel is growing ever brighter.",

We’ve got the perfect solution for you!\nWith the latest update, Visual Studio empowers you to seamlessly view and manage Git tags directly within the Git Repository window. This streamlined workflow ensures you remain within the familiar environment of the IDE, enhancing your productivity and efficiency when working with Git tags.\n\nEffortless navigation and action\nVisual Studio now allows you to handle Git tags without ever leaving the IDE. Gone are the days of interrupting your workflow to open a separate Git tool. The integration of Git tag management within Visual Studio means you can now:\nView all your tags effortlessly in the Git Repository window.\nQuickly navigate to the specific commit associated with a tag and view it in the git history graph.\nPerform a variety of actions on tags, including creating, pushing, and deleting, through an intuitive context menu that appears when you right-click on a tag.\nContinuous improvement with user feedback\nWe are continuously improving Visual Studio based on your feedback. Your insights help us create a better, more efficient development environment, and we are excited to see how this new Git tag management feature enhances your workflow. For example, a lot of the efforts such as the ability to delete tags were suggested via feedback tickets like the ability to delete tags.\nThank you for being a part of our journey and for helping us make Visual Studio the best IDE for developers.\nThe post View and manage git tags appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "앞서 AI에이전트 오픈 미노스를 분석해 보았는 데, 내친김에 그 동안 말많았던 딥시크(deep seek)를 분석해 보기로 한다. 개인적으로 언론의 기사를 잘 믿지는 않는다. 홍보성 퍼나른 기사가 많기도 하고, 특히 테크분야에서도 약장사분들? 많아, 어디까지 진실인지 아닌지 모르기 때문이다. 정말 대단한지, 아니면 지재권 완전 무시하고 기술 탈취?해 싼 제품 잘 만드는 중국 방식으로 개발된 것인지 알려진 자료에 기반해 팩트 확인해 보고자 한다.\n\n\n\n\n딥시크 (theconversation.com, 2025)\n\n\n참고로, 마누스 오픈소스에 관심 있다면 다음 링크를 참고한다. \n\n오픈 마누스(manus) AI 에이전트 설치, 사용 및 구조 분석하기\n\n\n\n딥시크 분석 준비\n다음 링크를 방문해 코드를 클론한다.\n\ndeepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\n\n\n\n\n\n터미널에서 다음 명령을 실행한다. \ngit clone https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.git\n\n\n폴더 및 파일 구조 분석 \nvscode를 띄워 보니 폴더 구조는 다음과 같다. \n\n  - workflows: 워크플로우 관련 폴더\n  - inference: 하위 폴더\n    - configs: 설정 파일 폴더\n    - convert.py: Python 파일, 4KB\n    - fp8_cast_b16f.py: Python 파일, 5KB\n    - generate.py: Python 파일, 8KB\n    - kernel.py: Python 파일, 9KB\n    - model.py: Python 파일, 8KB\n    - requirements.txt: 텍스트 파일, 1KB\n\n\n\n\n공개된 소스 코드를 보니 굳이 실행을 위한 패키지 설치는 할 필요 없을 것 같다. 일단, 오픈소스가 아니다. 단순히, inference 추론 코드만 공개되어 있다(어그로). 오픈소스라면, 최소한, train 학습 코드와 기본 데이터셋 정도는 공개되어야 한다(언론이 왜 오픈소스라 난리였는지 사실 이해가 안되는...). \n\n\n코드는 대부분 트랜스포머 구조를 그대로 사용한다. 트랜스포머스는 구글에서 이미 2017년 개발 공개된 LLM 모델 학습 메커니즘이다. 딥시크에서 사용한 상세한 기술을 알고 싶다면, 다음 링크를 참고하길 바란다.\n\n어텐션 기반 트랜스포머 딥러닝 모델 이해, 활용 사례 및 파치토치를 통한 간단한 사용방법 소개\n딥러닝 모델 트랜스포머 인코더 핵심 코드 구현을 통한 동작 메커니즘 이해하기\n트랜스포머 디코더 핵심 코드 구현을 통한 동작 메커니즘 이해하기\nSparse Mixture of Experts Language Model\n\n\n\n소스 코드 분석\n공개된 코드는 주로 추론을 위해 딥시크 측에서 공개한 학습된 가중치 모델 파일을 로딩해 사용하기 위한 model.py, 양자화로 성능 가속을 위한 fp8_cast_bf16.py, 질의 프롬프트에 대한 모델 출력을 생성하는 generate.py 정도가 분석할 필요가 있어 보인다. \n\n\nmodel.py 분석\n일단, 사용하는 라이브러리 대부분이 미국 빅테크 기업 혹은 연구소에서 개발된 것들을 임포트에 사용하고 있다. 이 분야에서 모르면 간첩인 pytorch, 심지어 triton은 NVIDIA GPU 가속 최적화를 위해 사용하는 라이브러리를 직접 사용한다(NVIDIA 종속적). \n\n\n모델의 전체 구조는 트랜스포머를 그대로 따르며, 이미 오픈소스 공개된 코드에 나오는 키워드도 다음처럼 그대로 사용하고 있다.\n\n\n\nmodel.forward를 확인해보자. 일반적인 트랜스포머스 forward 루틴으로 보여진다. \n\n    def forward(self, tokens: torch.Tensor, start_pos: int = 0):\n        seqlen = tokens.size(1)\n        h = self.embed(tokens)  # 1) 입력 임베딩\n        freqs_cis = self.freqs_cis[start_pos:start_pos+seqlen]  # 2) # 위치 인코딩\n        mask = None\n        if seqlen > 1:              # 3) 마스킹\n            mask = torch.full((seqlen, seqlen), float(\"-inf\"), device=tokens.device).triu_(1)\n        for layer in self.layers:   # 4) 트랜스포머스 레이어 실행 계산\n            h = layer(h, start_pos, freqs_cis, mask)\n        h = self.norm(h)[:, -1]   # 5) 출력 정규화\n        logits = self.head(h)     # 6) 로짓 계산\n        if world_size > 1:\n            all_logits = [torch.empty_like(logits) for _ in range(world_size)]\n            dist.all_gather(all_logits, logits)\n            logits = torch.cat(all_logits, dim=-1)\n        return logits\n\n\n이 함수는 입력 토큰을 받아 로짓(예측값)을 계산하는 역할을 한다. 예측값은 미리 준비된 사전에서 예측된 단어를 선택할 때 역할을 한다(입력 토큰에 대한 다음 토큰 예측 생성과정). 주요 동작은 다음과 같다.\n\nembed: 입력 임베딩 처리: 입력으로 제공된 토큰 텐서를 임베딩 레이어를 통해 변환하여 초기 입력 표현을 생성한다. \nfreqs_cis: 로터리 임베딩 계산:  주파수 정보를 담고 있는 로터리 임베딩 텐서를 시퀀스 길이에 맞게 선택하여, 위치 정보를 모델에 제공한다. 위치임베딩이란 기법도 이미 트랜스포머스 논문(Google, 2017)에 구현된 것이다.\nmask: 시퀀스 길이가 1보다 클 경우, 미래 정보가 영향을 미치지 않도록 상삼각형 형태의 마스크를 생성한다. 마스크는 모델이 언어 생성 시 현재 시점 이전의 정보만을 활용하게 한다.\nTransformer 레이어 통과: 모델 내부의 여러 Transformer 레이어를 입력 데이터가 순차적으로 통과하며, 각 레이어에서 입력 표현이 갱신된다. \nnorm: 출력 정규화 및 최종 표현 추출. 마지막 Transformer 레이어의 출력을 정규화하고, 시퀀스의 마지막 토큰에 해당하는 표현을 추출한다. \nlogits: 로짓 계산. 추출된 최종 표현을 출력 레이어(헤드)에 전달하여 로짓, 즉 예측값을 계산한다. 이는 각 토큰에 대한 다음 단어 또는 출력값의 확률 분포를 나타낸다.\n\n결과적으로, 이 메서드는 입력 토큰 시퀀스를 기반으로 각 토큰에 대한 예측값을 반환하며, 이는 주로 언어 모델링 및 자연어 처리 작업에 활용된다.\n\n\n모델의 전체 구조는 다음과 같다. 대부분 파이토치 기반 트랜스포머스 코드(이미 많이 공개된 코드 조각)를 사용한다(딥시크 처음 언론 보도가 실제로 얼마나 차이가 있는 지 확인할 수 있음).\n\n\n딥시크-V3 모델 구조(UML)\n다만, 실행 속도 등 최적화를 위해 병렬처리, torch.einsum 함수를 이용해 GPU 연산을 직접 이용해 트랜스포머 어텐션 모델 QKV 코사인 유사도 계산하는 등의 노력을 하고 있다(이 또한 이미 알려진 것).\n\n\n토큰 시퀀스 임베딩 벡터 간 유사도 스코어 계산 및 학습하는 부분(일부. 트랜스포머스 모델의 전형적인 루틴임. 여기서 bshd는 batch, source seqnce, heads, feature demension 의 약자로 입력 텐서의 모양-차원을 정의함)\n\n\nkernel.py 분석\n이 모듈은 주로 성능과 관련된 양자화를 다룬다. triton 라이브러리를 사용해 주어진 텐서를 양자화하여, 32비트 실수 연산을 8비트 실수 연산으로 처리할 수 있게 한다. 8비트 텐서 실수 연산을 위한 함수도 같이 구현되어 있다. 예를 들어, 다음 fp8_gemm 함수는 8비트 양자화된 a, b 텐서를 입력받아 행렬곱한 후 c를 리턴한다.\n\n\nconvert.py 분석\n이 모듈은 모델 파일 포맷을 주어진 옵션에 맞게 단순히 체크포인트 파일로 변환하는 역할을 한다. 복잡한 내용은 별로 없어 상세 설명은 생략한다.\n\n\nconfigs 파일 분석\n이 폴더 내 모델의 구조를 정의하는 주요 변수가 정의되어 있다. 예를 들어, config_16B.json 파일은 다음과 같이 정의된다. \n\n\n의미는 다음과 같다. \n\n1. 모델 구조  \n   - vocab_size: 어휘 크기 (102,400).  \n   - dim: 임베딩 차원 (2048).  \n   - inter_dim: FFN의 확장 차원 (10,944).  \n2. MoE 관련  \n   - n_routed_experts: 총 Expert 수 (64).  \n   - n_activated_experts: 활성화 Expert 수 (6).  \n   - moe_inter_dim: MoE Expert의 내부 FFN 차원 (1,408).  \n3. Attention 관련  \n   - n_layers: Transformer 레이어 수 (27).  \n   - n_heads: Attention Head 수 (16).  \n   - kv_lora_rank: 키/값 벡터의 LoRA 랭크 (512).  \n   - qk_nope_head_dim: NOPE 기반 헤드 차원 (128).  \n   - qk_rope_head_dim: RoPE 기반 헤드 차원 (64).  \n4. 기타  \n   - mscale: 모델 안정성을 위한 스케일 값 (0.707).  \n\n분석해 본 결과, 사실 LLM에서 모델 구조, 추론 구현 부분 및 양자화 모듈만 대부분 공개되어 있다는 것을 알 수 있다. \n\n\n최소한 데이터셋 모듈이라도 공개되어야 어떤 식으로 데이터를 학습했는지 확인할 수 있지만, 이런 중요 모듈은 공개되어 있지 않아, 딥시크-V3는 오픈소스를 공개했다고 말하기 어렵다(가중치와 모델 모듈만 오픈. 이건 reddit에서도 까이고 있는데, 그냥 오픈웨이트 open weights 모델 코드임).\n\n\n더 파보기\n오픈소스라기에는 좀 실망이라, 무언가 더 없는 지 공개된 자료들을 파보기로 한다. 일단, 딥시크 개발사 github에서 최근 주목받고 있는 프로젝트만 다음처럼 정렬해본다.\n\n\n이 중 체크한 부분이 먼가 있는 듯 하여, 들어가 확인해 본다. \n\n\nMIT 라이센스라 표시만 되어 있지, 코드가 없음\n\n\n딥시크 기반 코더는 평가, 데모 코드만 있고, 파인튠은 학습 데이터셋 제공 없음 \n\n평가 코드만 있음(MIT 라이센스 표시만. 오픈소스? 무슨 의미가?)\n\n딥시크-V3 학습모델(가중치파일) 공개된 부부(허깅페이스)\n더 파보았지만, 딥시크에서 주장하는 것은 오픈소스가 아닌 오픈웨이트 모델에 더 가까워보인다. 세계적인 홍보와 언론의 관심에 비해 무늬만 MIT라이센스 오픈소스가 아닌지 의문이다.\n\n마무리\n좀 시간을 내어 분석한 후, 확인 사살한 것은 다음과 같다. \n\n언론에서 말하는 것과는 상당한 차이가 있는 딥시크 기술 오픈소스였다. 대부분 이미 개발된 오픈소스를 가져다 쓴 것으로 보인다. 앞에 언급한 몇몇 성능 최적화 부분은 좋은 접근인 것이나, 메타(페북)의 라마(Llama)가 공개한 기술에 비하면 비교할 만한 것이 아니다.\n중국은 확실히 홍보(x10배)에 천재적인 능력(약팔이)이 있다(진심으로). \n중국이 잘하는 선진국(미국) 기술 가져와 자국것으로 포장해 저가로 파는 기술은 세계 최고다. \n\n의문점은 한국 언론에서 다음과 같이 패닉성 기사를 쓸 때, 왜 남이 말한 것 받아 만 쓰고 팩트 확인하지 않았냐는 것인데... 좀 생각해보니 국내 딥시크 기사는 관련 컨텐츠를 해외에서 퍼온 검증도 안된 글을 기사로 정리한 것으로 이해된다. 사실, 첨단 기술을 팩트 체크할 리소스가 있는 언론이 많지는 않다고 생각한다. 그럼에도 파급격있는 채널은 뉴스를 전할때 항상 팩트 확인하려는 노력이 필요하다.\n\n\n패닉성 딥시크 언론 보도(연합, 2025.1.27, 뉴스튜데이, 2025.3.28)\n\n\n자극적 기사들로 얼마 전 정부 국회는 패닉되고, 급하게 만든 인공지능 진흥전략이 판을 치게 된 트리거 역할을 했다. 여론은 인공지능분야도 우리가 중국에 뒤쳐졌다는 것을 확인하는 계기는 되었다. 긍정적 효과도 있었다고 생각되나, 부작용도 있다. 예를 들어,불필요한 일들이 벌어지고(갑작스런 GPU전수조사? 등), 갑작스런 대규모 GPU 센터 개발 계획이 발표되고, 이로 인해 세금이 비과적으로 계획 투입되고, .. 이상한 방향으로 국가 첨단기술 연구개발 전략이 설정되고... 대규모 세금이 투입되지 않을 까라는 생각을 들게 만든다.\n\n\n이 글에서 딥시크가 오픈소스 맞는지(거짓), 정말 중국 독자 기술로 개발했는지(거짓), 자국 GPU 사용해 개발했는 지(거짓. 기껏 추론 부분만 Google TPU같이 NPU 사용했을 가능성), 기술적 개선이 있었는지(성능 최적화 부분은 약간 인정), 정말 공개한 것은 무엇인지(모델만. 오픈웨이트) 등의 질문을 확인해 보았다. \n\n\n이 상황이면, GPT 학습 데이터를 증류해(카피해) 모델을 학습했다는 것이 더 신빙성 있어 보인다(가성비있게 실리콘밸리 테크 기술을 카피해 싸게 소프트웨어를 개발했다는 쪽이 더 맞는 듯. 물론 이것도 아무나 할 수 있는 건 아니다). 좀 더 시간이 있으면, 허깅페이스에 공개된 내용을 분석할 계획이다.\n\ndeepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3, huggingface\n\n\n\n레퍼런스\n\nDeepSeek-V3\nWhy DeepSeek V3 is considered open-source? : r/LocalLLaMA\nThe Triton Inference Server provides an optimized cloud and edge inferencing solution\nIntroduction - Triton documentation\ndeepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3\nOpenAI says DeepSeek ‘inappropriately’ copied ChatGPT – but it’s facing copyright claims too\nMixture of Experts\nSparse Mixture of Experts Language Model\nOpenness in Language Models: Open Source vs Open Weights vs Restricted Weights\n中 AI 딥시크, 챗GPT 제치고 美앱스토어 1위…실리콘밸리 충격, 연합뉴스\n[거꾸로 읽는 경제] 중국 딥시크 V3모델 출시\n딥시크, AI 모델 V3 업데이트 버전 공개",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "일을 하다 보면 '최선을 다했다'라는 표현을 쓸 때가 있습니다. 일이 넘쳐나는 환경에서 내가 없으면 안 돌아가는 것 같은 느낌은 가끔은 뿌듯함을 느끼기도 하지만 나 없다고 일이 안 돌아가는 환경에 허무함을 느끼기도 합니다.\n하루 종일 일을 하고서도 시간이 부족하다고 말하는 동료들을 볼 때면 고생스러움에 위로와 응원을 남기곤 하지만, 그런 일상이 일주일, 한 달이 되어도 나아지지 않는다면 도대체 무슨 일을 하길래 그렇게 소진되는 삶을 유지하는가 들여다보게 됩니다.\n정말 일이 많아서, 팀에 사람이 부족해서, 나의 역량보다 주어진 일의 난도가 높아서 진짜로 야근을 밥보다 많이 해내야 하는 때도 분명히 있습니다. 하지만 진짜 문제는 너무 바쁜 나머지 일의 우선순위를 구분하지 못하고 오히려 닥치는 대로 해냈을 때입니다.\n이런 경우는 일을 바라보는 관점이 했다(1) 혹은 안 했다(0)는 것으로 나뉠 때입니다. 일의 수준을 제대로 정의하지 못해서 1을 만들기 위하여, 그것이 내 기준의 완벽함에 부합해야 한다고 생각할 때 늪에 빠지는 것이죠. 이렇게 작은 일, 큰 일 가릴 것 없이 모든 일에 같은 에너지를 쏟아붓다 보면, 결국 중요한 일을 할 에너지가 남지 않게 됩니다.\n\n적정한 Scale 을 결정하고 Effort 를 조정합시다 - ChatGPT 생성\n모든 일에 최선을 다한다는 것은 마치 종이 전체를 검은색으로 칠하는 것과 같습니다. 하지만 계획과 구상을 통해 힘을 조절하고 그림을 그려낸다면 전체를 파악하고 있다고 볼 수 있습니다. 전체를 파악하지 못하면 덜 중요한 일부터 하게 됩니다. 이것의 차이를 전문성으로 볼 수 있습니다.\n전문성이란 일의 경중을 구분하고, 그에 맞는 적절한 노력과 시간을 배분하는 능력입니다. 작은 일도 '이 정도 퀄리티로 마무리하면 충분하다'는 감이 있고, 중요한 일에는 그에 맞는 더 깊이 있는 고민과 시간을 쏟을 줄 아는 것이죠. 쉽게 말해, 노력과 에너지를 상황에 맞게 '스케일 조정'할 수 있는 사람이 바로 전문가입니다. \n예를 들어, 누군가가 나에게 100만 원짜리 일을 맡겼다면 그 가치를 충족할 만큼의 시간과 에너지를 투입해야 합니다. 만약 그만큼의 노력을 들이지 않았다면 계약위반이죠. 반대로, 100만 원을 받고 1,000만 원어치의 시간과 노력을 쏟았다면, 그건 전문가가 아니라 호구 아닐까요? 어떠한 작업에 퀄리티를 결정하고, 자원 투입 여부를 결정할 수 있어야 하는 것이 진짜 일 잘하는 사람이 아닐까 합니다.\n\n일을 할 때의 메타인지란 '나 잘하고 있나?'가 아닙니다. \"내가 지금 이 일에 너무 많은 에너지를 쓰고 있지는 않은가?\" \"이 일을 이 정도 수준으로 마치는 게 맞는가?\" 이런 질문을 스스로 던지고 답을 찾으세요. \n이 질문을 돌아보지 않는다면 정작 가장 중요한 일을 놓치고, 불필요한 일에 에너지를 다 쏟고, 스스로를 점점 지치게 만듭니다. 일을 하는 중에 생각해 내면 가장 좋은 타이밍입니다. 수시로 하기가 어렵다면 하루를 보낸 뒤에 돌아보세요. 오늘 하루의 최선이 현명한 최선이었는지, 무식한 최선이었는지. 나를 앞으로 나아가게 하는지, 소모하고 있는지 말입니다. \n모든 일에 에너지를 다 써버리면, 정작 예상치 못한 중요한 순간에 쏟을 힘이 남아 있지 않습니다. 하지만 일의 무게를 가늠하고, 집중할 곳과 멈출 곳을 아는 사람은 언제든 닥쳐올 변화에 맞설 수 있는 에너지를 남겨둡니다. 그리고 이건 단순히 하루를 덜 지치기 위해 필요한 기술만은 아닙니다. 예측할 수 없는 변화와 불확실성에 대비하는 방법이기도 하죠. \n우선순위를 정리하지 못하고 하루 종일 일하는 동료들을 보며 무엇보다 안타까운 것은 그렇게 모든 일에 최선을 다하고도 정작 중요한 일에서는 힘을 쓰지 못한 채 스스로를 탓하는 경우를 종종 본다는 점입니다. 그 모습이 과거의 저와 너무 닮아있었기에 그래서 더 이 이야기를 꼭 하고 싶었습니다. \n웹툰 <미생> \n에너지를 남기세요. 이는 게으른 것이 아닙니다. 오히려 내가 정말 잘하고 싶은 일, 나다운 일을 위해 집중력을 지키는 법이니까요. 애는 쓰되 지치지 않고, 열정적이되 무리하지 않는 사람. 그런 사람에게 일의 기회가 더 주어질 수밖에 없습니다. 물이 꽉 찬 항아리에는 더 부을 수 없으니까요.",

나오니까요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>무료 XML 프롬프트 템플릿의 핵심 특징 ✨</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 프롬프트 엔지니어 GPT의 가장 큰 특징은 <b>구조화된 XML 형식</b>이라는 점이에요. 일반 텍스트와 달리, XML은 정보를 체계적으로 구성할 수 있게 해주거든요. 실제로 어떤 차이가 있는지 살펴볼까요?</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\">1. 변수 활용으로 맞춤형 응답 가능</span></h3>\n<pre class=\"dust\"><code>&lt;question&gt;{$QUESTION}&lt;/question&gt;\n&lt;level&gt;{$STUDENT_LEVEL}&lt;/level&gt;\n&lt;language&gt;{$PREFERRED_LANGUAGE}&lt;/language&gt;</code></pre>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 식으로 변수를 설정해두면, 나중에 실제 값만 바꿔서 계속 재사용할 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 수학 문제를 풀 때 학생 수준(초등/중등/고등)에 따라 설명 방식을 자동으로 조절할 수 있죠.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\">2. 단계별 사고 과정 지정</span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI가 어떤 순서로 생각하고 답변을 구성할지 정확히 지정할 수 있어요. 예컨대 수학 문제를 풀 때:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\" data-ke-list-type=\"decimal\">\n<li>먼저 문제를 이해하고</li>\n<li>관련 수학 개념을 설명한 다음</li>\n<li>단계별 풀이 과정을 보여주고</li>\n<li>마지막으로 답을 정리하는</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">식으로 명확한 흐름을 만들 수 있죠. 이렇게 하면 AI가 중간에 길을 잃고 딴소리를 할 가능성이 훨씬 줄어들어요.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\">3. 도구 활용 지침 포함</span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히 좋았던 건, 필요할 때 AI의 특수 기능(이미지 생성, 웹 검색, 코드 실행 등)을 자동으로 활용하도록 설정할 수 있다는 점이었어요. 예전에는 \"이미지 만들어줘\"라고 따로 요청해야 했는데, 이제는 템플릿에 미리 설정해둘 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>실제 사용법 - 누구나 할 수 있어요!

AI에게 물어봤는데 답변이 너무 길거나, 너무 짧거나, 아니면 완전히 딴소리를 하는 경우? 오늘은 그런 문제를 해결할 수 있는 '프롬프트 엔지니어 GPT'를 직접 만들어 소개해드리려고 합니다. 무료로 사용할 수 있어요!\n \n프롬프트 엔지니어 GPT란?  \n프롬프트 엔지니어 GPT는 간단히 말해서 AI에게 명확한 지시를 내릴 수 있도록 도와주는 일종의 '번역기'예요. 사용자가 원하는 작업을 간단히 설명하면, 이를 AI가 정확히 이해하고 실행할 수 있는 구조화된 프롬프트로 변환해주는 거죠.\n \n특히 XML 기반의 구조화된 템플릿을 만들어주기 때문에, AI의 응답이 훨씬 일관되고 예측 가능해져요. 마치 요리 레시피처럼 정확한 단계와 지시사항을 제공하는 셈이죠.\n \n예전에는 AI에게 \"좀 더 자세히 설명해줘\"라고 여러 번 요청해야 했던 것들이, 이제는 한 번에 원하는 형태로 딱! 나오니까요.\n \n무료 XML 프롬프트 템플릿의 핵심 특징 ✨\n이 프롬프트 엔지니어 GPT의 가장 큰 특징은 구조화된 XML 형식이라는 점이에요. 일반 텍스트와 달리, XML은 정보를 체계적으로 구성할 수 있게 해주거든요. 실제로 어떤 차이가 있는지 살펴볼까요?\n1. 변수 활용으로 맞춤형 응답 가능\n<question>{$QUESTION}</question>\n<level>{$STUDENT_LEVEL}</level>\n<language>{$PREFERRED_LANGUAGE}</language>\n이런 식으로 변수를 설정해두면, 나중에 실제 값만 바꿔서 계속 재사용할 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 수학 문제를 풀 때 학생 수준(초등/중등/고등)에 따라 설명 방식을 자동으로 조절할 수 있죠.\n2. 단계별 사고 과정 지정\nAI가 어떤 순서로 생각하고 답변을 구성할지 정확히 지정할 수 있어요. 예컨대 수학 문제를 풀 때:\n먼저 문제를 이해하고\n관련 수학 개념을 설명한 다음\n단계별 풀이 과정을 보여주고\n마지막으로 답을 정리하는\n식으로 명확한 흐름을 만들 수 있죠. 이렇게 하면 AI가 중간에 길을 잃고 딴소리를 할 가능성이 훨씬 줄어들어요.\n3. 도구 활용 지침 포함\n특히 좋았던 건, 필요할 때 AI의 특수 기능(이미지 생성, 웹 검색, 코드 실행 등)을 자동으로 활용하도록 설정할 수 있다는 점이었어요. 예전에는 \"이미지 만들어줘\"라고 따로 요청해야 했는데, 이제는 템플릿에 미리 설정해둘 수 있어요.\n \n \n실제 사용법 - 누구나 할 수 있어요!  ‍ \n사용법이 어렵지 않을까 걱정하셨다면 안심하세요. 생각보다 훨씬 간단합니다!\n방법 1: ChatGPT에 직접 활용하기\n가장 쉬운 방법은 ChatGPT 창에 다음과 같은 형식으로 입력하는 거예요:\n<x-tutor>\n  <question>x + 3 = 7, x의 값을 구하시오</question>\n  <level>초등학생</level>\n  <language>한국어</language>\n</x-tutor>\n이렇게만 입력해도 AI는 XML 구조를 인식하고, 초등학생 수준에 맞춰 한국어로 방정식을 설명해 줍니다.\n아니면 그냥 일상 대화처럼:\n\"초등학생이 이해할 수 있도록 'x + 3 = 7' 문제를 단계적으로 풀어줘. 설명은 한국어로 해줘.\"\n이렇게 입력해도 돼요. 훨씬 간단하죠?\n방법 2: 나만의 Custom GPT 만들기\n조금 더 발전된 방법은 Custom GPT를 만드는 거예요(ChatGPT Plus 구독자만 가능):\nhttps://chat.openai.com/gpts 접속\n\"Create a GPT\" 클릭\n\"Instructions\"에 XML 템플릿 내용을 붙여넣기\n설정 후 저장\n이렇게 하면 매번 복잡한 프롬프트를 입력할 필요 없이, 간단한 질문만으로도 구조화된 응답을 받을 수 있어요.\n \n \n활용 사례 - 이럴 때 특히 유용해요!  \n이번 무료 GPTS는 특히 이런 상황에서 정말 유용했어요:\n1. 교육 콘텐츠 제작\n학생들을 위한 단계별 학습 자료를 만들 때, 수준별로 다른 설명을 자동으로 생성할 수 있었어요. 초등학생용, 중학생용, 고등학생용 설명을 각각 따로 만들 필요 없이, 변수만 바꿔서 쓸 수 있으니 시간이 엄청 절약되더라고요.\n2. 비즈니스 문서 작성\n보고서나 제안서 작성할 때도 좋았어요. 목표, 대상, 톤앤매너 등을 변수로 지정해두면, 비슷한 문서를 여러 번 만들 때 일관된 품질을 유지할 수 있었거든요.\n3. 코드 설명 및 디버깅\n프로그래밍 코드를 설명하거나 디버깅할 때도 유용했어요. 코드의 난이도와 사용자의 프로그래밍 지식 수준에 따라 설명 깊이를 자동으로 조절할 수 있으니까요.\n \n \nXML과 일반 텍스트 프롬프트의 차이  \n사실 처음에는 \"그냥 일반 텍스트로 물어보면 되지, 왜 XML이 필요해?\"라는 의문이 들었어요. 근데 직접 비교해보니 확실히 차이가 있더라고요.\nXML 템플릿\n일반 텍스트\n\n\n\n\n구조가 명확해서 일관된 결과\n때에 따라 결과가 들쑥날쑥\n\n\n변수 활용으로 재사용 쉬움\n매번 비슷한 지시를 반복해야 함\n\n\n시스템 연동이 용이함\n자동화하기 어려움\n\n\n처음 설정이 약간 복잡함\n바로 사용 가능함\n\n\n\n \n실제로 같은 질문을 XML 형식과 일반 텍스트로 각각 물어봤을 때, XML 형식이 훨씬 더 구조화되고 완성도 높은 답변을 주더라고요.\n \n무료로 프롬프트 엔지니어링 시작하기  \n이 모든 기능을 무료로 사용할 수 있어요! ChatGPT의 무료 버전에서도 XML 템플릿을 입력하는 방식으로 충분히 활용 가능합니다. 물론 Custom GPT를 만들려면 Plus 구독이 필요하지만...\n시작하는 가장 쉬운 방법은 GPTS 에 생성한 아래 예시와 같은 템플릿을 복사해서 ChatGPT에 붙여넣는 거예요:\n<x-tutor>\n  <question>2x - 4 = 10</question>\n  <level>중학생</level>\n  <language>한국어</language>\n</x-tutor>\n이런 식으로 시작해보고, 점점 자신만의 템플릿을 만들어 나가면 됩니다. 처음엔 간단한 템플릿부터 시작해서, 익숙해지면 더 복잡한 구조로 발전시켜 보세요.\n \n* 초보분들을 위해 이번 GPTS에는 XML 템플릿 형태의 프롬프트외에도 일반적인 프롬프트도 함께 제공하니 안심하세요!!\n \n마무리: 프롬프트 엔지니어링의 미래  \n프롬프트 엔지니어링은 앞으로 더욱 중요해질 것 같아요. AI 기술이 발전할수록, 정확한 지시를 내리는 능력이 더욱 가치 있게 될 테니까요.\n이번 기회에 XML 기반 프롬프트 템플릿을 한번 사용해보세요. 처음에는 약간 어색할 수 있지만, 금방 익숙해지고 AI와의 소통이 훨씬 원활해지는 걸 경험하실 수 있을 거예요.\n여러분도 이제 \"그냥 AI 사용자\"가 아닌 \"프롬프트 엔지니어\"로 한 단계 업그레이드해 보는 건 어떨까요? 댓글로 여러분의 경험이나 질문을 공유해주세요!\n자주 묻는 질문 (Q&A)  \nQ: XML 문법을 잘 몰라도 사용할 수 있나요?\nA: 네, 기본적인 태그 구조만 이해하시면 충분합니다. 여는 태그와 닫는 태그만 맞추면 돼요.\nQ: 무료 ChatGPT에서도 사용 가능한가요?\nA: 네, 템플릿을 복사해서 붙여넣기만 하면 무료 버전에서도 동일하게 작동합니다.\nQ: 어떤 언어로도 사용 가능한가요?\nA: 물론이죠! 한국어, 영어, 일본어 등 ChatGPT가 지원하는 모든 언어로 활용 가능합니다.\nQ: 프로그래밍이나 기술적 지식이 필요한가요?\nA: 아니요, 기본적인 태그 구조만 이해하시면 됩니다. 복사-붙여넣기로도 충분히 시작할 수 있어요.\nQ: 비슷한 유료 서비스와 비교해서 기능 차이가 있나요?\nA: 유료 서비스들은 더 많은 템플릿이나 통합 기능을 제공하지만, 기본적인 프롬프트 엔지니어링 기능은 이 무료 방식으로도 충분히 활용할 수 있습니다.\n \n \n  GPTS 무료배포\n 약간의 지식과 시간만 투자하면 누구나 직접 제작하고 활용할 수 있는 유용한 GPTs가 이미 많이 존재합니다. 그러나 여전히 AI 기술에 대한 낯선 접근을 두려워하거나 IT 초보자, 또는 시간적 여유가 없거나 수익화에 대한 절실함 때문에 올바른 정보를 얻지 못하는 사람들이 많습니다. \n이러한 심리를 악용해 과도한 가격으로 유료 강의를 판매하며 불필요한 부담을 주는 사례들이 늘어나고 있습니다.\n \n 이에 본 블로그에서는 모든 사람이 AI의 혜택을 공정하고 자유롭게 누릴 수 있도록 GPTs를 무료로 배포하며, 불합리한 강의 판매 행위를 단호히 배척하고자 합니다. (당연히 저도 무료 그 이상의 가치가 있는 챗봇이라면 유료화를 검토중입니다.)\n\n \nChatGPT - 프롬프트 마법사 (Prompt Wizard)\n사용자의 간단한 작업 설명을 XML 기반의 구조화된 프롬프트 템플릿으로 변환해 드립니다. AI가 고품질 결과를 생성할 수 있도록 변수 구조화, 내부 추론, 출력 포맷 설계를 최적화합니다. 문서\nchatgpt.com\n\n\n \n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"XML 문법을 잘 몰라도 사용할 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 기본적인 태그 구조만 이해하시면 충분합니다. 여는 태그와 닫는 태그만 맞추면 돼요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"무료 ChatGPT에서도 사용 가능한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 템플릿을 복사해서 붙여넣기만 하면 무료 버전에서도 동일하게 작동합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"어떤 언어로도 사용 가능한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"물론이죠! 한국어, 영어, 일본어 등 ChatGPT가 지원하는 모든 언어로 활용 가능합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"프로그래밍이나 기술적 지식이 필요한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"아니요, 기본적인 태그 구조만 이해하시면 됩니다. 복사-붙여넣기로도 충분히 시작할 수 있어요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"비슷한 유료 서비스와 비교해서 기능 차이가 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"유료 서비스들은 더 많은 템플릿이나 통합 기능을 제공하지만, 기본적인 프롬프트 엔지니어링 기능은 이 무료 방식으로도 충분히 활용할 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Perplexity가 좋은 이유 중 하나죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">하지만 GPT-4.5를 사용해본 결과, 추론 능력이 Perplexity에 비해 아직 많이 부족하다고 느꼈어요. 대부분의 경우 설명이 그냥 불필요한 말 늘리기 같달까... 의미 없는 단어들을 나열하는 느낌이었어요. 이건 오히려 아무 설명도 없는 것보다 더 짜증나더라고요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 생각은 저만 그런 게 아니에요. 다른 사용자들도 소프트웨어가 같은 단어를 반복적으로 추가하는 문제를 경험했다고 해요. 개선 방법은 간단해요. ChatGPT가 설명한 다음 후속 질문을 하면 좋을 것 같아요. Deep Research 도구는 이런 면에서 꽤 좋더라고요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>내 요청을 무시하는 느낌...  </b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">ChatGPT를 쓰기 시작한 이후로, 내가 말하는 것을 완전히 듣지 않는 문제가 있었어요. GPT-4.5에서는 이런 문제가 줄어들길 바랐는데... 안타깝게도 그렇지 않은 것 같네요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 버전을 사용할 때 AI가 중요한 포인트를 그냥 훑어보는 느낌이에요. 결과적으로 내가 이루려고 했던 목적을 놓친 기본적인 응답만 남게 돼요. 그러면 프롬프트를 다시 작성해야 하는데, 이게 빨리 짜증나게 되더라고요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이걸 고치려면 GPT-4.5가 내 텍스트의 모든 부분을 비판적으로 분석해야 할 것 같아요. 솔직히 저도 좀 더 전략적으로 접근할 수 있을 거예요. AI 프롬프팅 팁과 트릭을 사용하는 거죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT에게 어떤 영역에 가장 집중해야 하는지 명확하게 말해주는 방법도 있겠죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>GPT-4.5는 긴 텍스트에서 약해요  </b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">사람들은 ChatGPT가 출시된 이후로 계속 그것의 글쓰기 능력에 대해 이야기해왔어요. 솔직히 저는 그렇게 감명받지 않았어요. 아마 제가 전문 작가라서 편향된 생각일 수도 있지만, AI로 작성된 글인지 너무 쉽게 알 수 있더라고요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래도 저는 항상 새로운 기술을 받아들일 준비가 되어 있어요. 그래서 ChatGPT가 효과적으로 텍스트를 작성할 수 있는지 보고 싶었어요. 짧은 텍스트는 괜찮은데, 긴 글은 아직도 좋지 않은 것 같아요. 다른 사람들도 ChatGPT의 창의적 글쓰기 도구에 확신이 없더라고요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">GPT-4.5는 긴 텍스트를 작성할 때 여전히 너무 형식적으로 느껴져요. 프롬프트를 잘못 이해하기 때문에 다시 작성해야 할 때도 있었어요. 게다가, 논픽션 글쓰기는 더 나아졌지만, 실제 인간의 창의성이 필요한 것들은 잘 못하더라고요. 예를 들어, 아래 텍스트는 전혀 깊이가 없어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">아마 미래 모델에서는 생각이 바뀔 수도 있겠지만, 지금은 ChatGPT로 글을 쓰지는 않을 것 같아요. 이걸 개선하려면 OpenAI가 더 많은 인간의 입력과 더 넓은 맥락을 제공해야 할 것 같아요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>사용 제한으로 실험하기 어려워요 ⏱️</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">ChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구나 AI 비디오 생성을 위한 Sora 사용처럼, GPT-4.5도 사용량 제한이 있어요. ChatGPT가 명시적으로 얼마인지 말하진 않지만, 글 쓰는 시점에서는 약 45-50개 프롬프트 정도에요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 매일 주로 실험을 위해 ChatGPT를 사용해요. 이전 버전에서는 무제한 프롬프트가 있었기 때문에 실험이 가능했어요. 하지만 여러 다양한 방향을 탐색할 수 없다면, 할 수 있는 일이 제한된 느낌이에요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">아마 언젠가는 사용 제한이 제거될 테지만, 지금으로서는 꽤 짜증나요. 간단한 개선책은 제한을 늘리거나 모두에게 무제한 프롬프트를 제공하는 거예요. 이렇게 될 때까지 \"[남은 숫자] 남음\" 경고가 항상 있으면 좋을 것 같아요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>GPT-4.5의 응답은 매우 일관성이 없어요  </b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">ChatGPT 4.0도 완벽하진 않지만, 적어도 응답이 꽤 일관적이에요. 프롬프트를 입력하기 전에 나중에 다시 작성해야 할지 꽤 잘 예상할 수 있었어요. 그러나 GPT-4.5는 그렇지 않아요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 받는 응답 중 일부는 꽤 좋지만, 다른 것들은 그렇지 않아요. 이런 면에서 OpenAI의 이미지 생성 모델인 DALL-E와 비슷해요. 소프트웨어는 간단한 요청은 처리할 수 있지만 더 복잡한 요청에서는 어려움을 겪어요. 아마 그래서 Deep Research가 필요한 건지도 모르겠지만, 그러면 또 이전처럼 프롬프트 제한에 부딪히게 되고, Deep Research는 일부 대화에는 좀 과한 느낌이에요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">감성 지능과 같은 새로운 기능이 초기 문제를 겪을 것이라고 이해해요. 개선하려면 소프트웨어가 더 인간처럼 행동하는 것과 각 대화를 완전히 이해하는 것 사이의 균형을 맞춰야 할 것 같아요. 그렇게 하면 최고의 GPT-4 기능을 더 발전시킬 수 있을 거예요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>GPT-4.5는 파일 업로드에서 어려움을 겪어요  </b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">이건 프롬프트 응답의 문제라기보다는 기술적인 문제인데, GPT-4.5로 전환할 때 가끔 파일을 업로드하는 데 어려움을 겪었어요. 이런 문제가 소프트웨어의 더 발전된 추론 능력이 빛날 수 있는 부분이라고 생각하는데, 이런 문제를 만나면 정말 짜증나요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">Sora에서도 비슷한 문제가 있었어요. 처음 로그인했을 때 앱이 제가 이미 ChatGPT Plus 구독이 있다는 것을 인식하지 못했어요. 파일 업로드 문제도 결국 해결될 거라고 예상해요. 빠를수록 좋겠죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">GPT-4.5가 완벽해지기까지 갈 길이 멀다는 걸 알아요. 하지만 현재 형태의 모델에는 실망했어요. OpenAI의 이전 모델들처럼, 이런 문제들이 해결되는 데 오래 걸리지 않을 거예요. 하지만 당분간 GPT-4.5는 제 첫 번째 선택이 아닐 것 같네요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-origin-width=\"616\" data-origin-height=\"715\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bRguYI/btsM206DW9S/uayskShnseg36VNKVWx1CK/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bRguYI/btsM206DW9S/uayskShnseg36VNKVWx1CK/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bRguYI/btsM206DW9S/uayskShnseg36VNKVWx1CK/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FbRguYI%2FbtsM206DW9S%2FuayskShnseg36VNKVWx1CK%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"616\" height=\"715\" data-origin-width=\"616\" data-origin-height=\"715\"/></span></figure>\n</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>마치며...  </b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">솔직히 말해서, GPT-4.5는 저한테 '혁신적'이라기보다는 '진화중'인 느낌이에요. 사람들의 기대치가 너무 높아져서 그런지도 모르겠지만, 광고한 만큼의 혁신을 느끼기는 어려웠어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래도 AI 기술이 계속 발전하고 있다는 점은 분명하고, OpenAI도 피드백을 들으면서 개선할 거라고 생각해요. 지금 당장은 좀 실망스럽더라도, 앞으로 어떻게 발전할지 지켜보는 것도 재미있을 것 같아요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">여러분은 GPT-4.5에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나요? 저처럼 실망하셨나요, 아니면 제가 뭔가 놓치고 있는 걸까요? 댓글로 여러분의 경험을 공유해주세요!</p>\n<hr contenteditable=\"false\" data-ke-type=\"horizontalRule\" data-ke-style=\"style1\" />\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #ee2323;\"><b>자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q: GPT-4.5는 이전 모델보다 얼마나 더 빠른가요?</b></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A: 처리 속도는 비슷하며, 특별히 빨라진 느낌은 없습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q: 무료 버전에서도 GPT-4.5를 사용할 수 있나요?</b></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A: 아니요, 현재 GPT-4.5는 ChatGPT Plus 구독자에게만 제공됩니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q: GPT-4.5의 사용 제한은 얼마인가요?</b></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A: 공식적으로는 명시되지 않았지만, 약 45-50개 프롬프트 정도로 알려져 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q: Perplexity AI와 비교했을 때 GPT-4.5의 장단점은 무엇인가요?</b></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A: GPT-4.5는 기본 기능이 더 다양하지만, Perplexity는 추론과 설명 측면에서 더 뛰어납니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q: GPT-4.5의 주요 개선점은 무엇인가요?</b></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">A: 감성 지능 향상과 추론 능력 개선이 주요 개선점으로 광고되었지만, 실제로 체감되는 차이는 크지 않습니다.</p>\n<script type=\"application/ld+json\">\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [{\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT-4.5는 이전 모델보다 얼마나 더 빠른가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"처리 속도는 비슷하며, 특별히 빨라진 느낌은 없습니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"무료 버전에서도 GPT-4.5를 사용할 수 있나요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"아니요, 현재 GPT-4.5는 ChatGPT Plus 구독자에게만 제공됩니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT-4.5의 사용 제한은 얼마인가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"공식적으로는 명시되지 않았지만, 약 45-50개 프롬프트 정도로 알려져 있습니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"Perplexity AI와 비교했을 때 GPT-4.5의 장단점은 무엇인가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"GPT-4.5는 기본 기능이 더 다양하지만, Perplexity는 추론과 설명 측면에서 더 뛰어납니다.\"\n    }\n  }, {\n    \"@type\": \"Question\",\n    \"name\": \"GPT-4.5의 주요 개선점은 무엇인가요?\",\n    \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n      \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n      \"text\": \"감정 지능 향상과 추론 능력 개선이 주요 개선점으로 광고되었지만, 실제로 체감되는 차이는 크지 않습니다.\"\n    }\n  }]\n}\n</script>\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -60px; top: 3835.2px;\">\n<div class=\"gtx-trans-icon\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

AI 프롬프팅 팁과 트릭을 사용하는 거죠. 예를 들어, ChatGPT에게 어떤 영역에 가장 집중해야 하는지 명확하게 말해주는 방법도 있겠죠.\n \nGPT-4.5는 긴 텍스트에서 약해요  \n사람들은 ChatGPT가 출시된 이후로 계속 그것의 글쓰기 능력에 대해 이야기해왔어요. 솔직히 저는 그렇게 감명받지 않았어요. 아마 제가 전문 작가라서 편향된 생각일 수도 있지만, AI로 작성된 글인지 너무 쉽게 알 수 있더라고요.\n그래도 저는 항상 새로운 기술을 받아들일 준비가 되어 있어요. 그래서 ChatGPT가 효과적으로 텍스트를 작성할 수 있는지 보고 싶었어요. 짧은 텍스트는 괜찮은데, 긴 글은 아직도 좋지 않은 것 같아요. 다른 사람들도 ChatGPT의 창의적 글쓰기 도구에 확신이 없더라고요.\nGPT-4.5는 긴 텍스트를 작성할 때 여전히 너무 형식적으로 느껴져요. 프롬프트를 잘못 이해하기 때문에 다시 작성해야 할 때도 있었어요. 게다가, 논픽션 글쓰기는 더 나아졌지만, 실제 인간의 창의성이 필요한 것들은 잘 못하더라고요. 예를 들어, 아래 텍스트는 전혀 깊이가 없어요.\n아마 미래 모델에서는 생각이 바뀔 수도 있겠지만, 지금은 ChatGPT로 글을 쓰지는 않을 것 같아요. 이걸 개선하려면 OpenAI가 더 많은 인간의 입력과 더 넓은 맥락을 제공해야 할 것 같아요.\n \n사용 제한으로 실험하기 어려워요 ⏱️\nChatGPT의 Deep Research 도구나 AI 비디오 생성을 위한 Sora 사용처럼, GPT-4.5도 사용량 제한이 있어요. ChatGPT가 명시적으로 얼마인지 말하진 않지만, 글 쓰는 시점에서는 약 45-50개 프롬프트 정도에요.\n저는 매일 주로 실험을 위해 ChatGPT를 사용해요. 이전 버전에서는 무제한 프롬프트가 있었기 때문에 실험이 가능했어요. 하지만 여러 다양한 방향을 탐색할 수 없다면, 할 수 있는 일이 제한된 느낌이에요.\n아마 언젠가는 사용 제한이 제거될 테지만, 지금으로서는 꽤 짜증나요. 간단한 개선책은 제한을 늘리거나 모두에게 무제한 프롬프트를 제공하는 거예요. 이렇게 될 때까지 \"[남은 숫자] 남음\" 경고가 항상 있으면 좋을 것 같아요.\n \nGPT-4.5의 응답은 매우 일관성이 없어요  \nChatGPT 4.0도 완벽하진 않지만, 적어도 응답이 꽤 일관적이에요. 프롬프트를 입력하기 전에 나중에 다시 작성해야 할지 꽤 잘 예상할 수 있었어요. 그러나 GPT-4.5는 그렇지 않아요.\n제가 받는 응답 중 일부는 꽤 좋지만, 다른 것들은 그렇지 않아요. 이런 면에서 OpenAI의 이미지 생성 모델인 DALL-E와 비슷해요. 소프트웨어는 간단한 요청은 처리할 수 있지만 더 복잡한 요청에서는 어려움을 겪어요. 아마 그래서 Deep Research가 필요한 건지도 모르겠지만, 그러면 또 이전처럼 프롬프트 제한에 부딪히게 되고, Deep Research는 일부 대화에는 좀 과한 느낌이에요.\n감성 지능과 같은 새로운 기능이 초기 문제를 겪을 것이라고 이해해요. 개선하려면 소프트웨어가 더 인간처럼 행동하는 것과 각 대화를 완전히 이해하는 것 사이의 균형을 맞춰야 할 것 같아요. 그렇게 하면 최고의 GPT-4 기능을 더 발전시킬 수 있을 거예요.\n \nGPT-4.5는 파일 업로드에서 어려움을 겪어요  \n이건 프롬프트 응답의 문제라기보다는 기술적인 문제인데, GPT-4.5로 전환할 때 가끔 파일을 업로드하는 데 어려움을 겪었어요. 이런 문제가 소프트웨어의 더 발전된 추론 능력이 빛날 수 있는 부분이라고 생각하는데, 이런 문제를 만나면 정말 짜증나요.\nSora에서도 비슷한 문제가 있었어요. 처음 로그인했을 때 앱이 제가 이미 ChatGPT Plus 구독이 있다는 것을 인식하지 못했어요. 파일 업로드 문제도 결국 해결될 거라고 예상해요. 빠를수록 좋겠죠.\nGPT-4.5가 완벽해지기까지 갈 길이 멀다는 걸 알아요. 하지만 현재 형태의 모델에는 실망했어요. OpenAI의 이전 모델들처럼, 이런 문제들이 해결되는 데 오래 걸리지 않을 거예요. 하지만 당분간 GPT-4.5는 제 첫 번째 선택이 아닐 것 같네요.\n \n\n\n \n마치며...  \n솔직히 말해서, GPT-4.5는 저한테 '혁신적'이라기보다는 '진화중'인 느낌이에요. 사람들의 기대치가 너무 높아져서 그런지도 모르겠지만, 광고한 만큼의 혁신을 느끼기는 어려웠어요.\n그래도 AI 기술이 계속 발전하고 있다는 점은 분명하고, OpenAI도 피드백을 들으면서 개선할 거라고 생각해요. 지금 당장은 좀 실망스럽더라도, 앞으로 어떻게 발전할지 지켜보는 것도 재미있을 것 같아요.\n여러분은 GPT-4.5에 대해 어떻게 생각하시나요? 저처럼 실망하셨나요, 아니면 제가 뭔가 놓치고 있는 걸까요? 댓글로 여러분의 경험을 공유해주세요!\n자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ: GPT-4.5는 이전 모델보다 얼마나 더 빠른가요?\nA: 처리 속도는 비슷하며, 특별히 빨라진 느낌은 없습니다.\nQ: 무료 버전에서도 GPT-4.5를 사용할 수 있나요?\nA: 아니요, 현재 GPT-4.5는 ChatGPT Plus 구독자에게만 제공됩니다.\nQ: GPT-4.5의 사용 제한은 얼마인가요?\nA: 공식적으로는 명시되지 않았지만, 약 45-50개 프롬프트 정도로 알려져 있습니다.\nQ: Perplexity AI와 비교했을 때 GPT-4.5의 장단점은 무엇인가요?\nA: GPT-4.5는 기본 기능이 더 다양하지만, Perplexity는 추론과 설명 측면에서 더 뛰어납니다.\nQ: GPT-4.5의 주요 개선점은 무엇인가요?\nA: 감성 지능 향상과 추론 능력 개선이 주요 개선점으로 광고되었지만, 실제로 체감되는 차이는 크지 않습니다.",

그룹의 “얼또(얼리 또라이가 세상을 바꾼다)”의 이름에 영감을 받고, 운영자이신 미정님에게 허락을 구하고 사용했다\n기본적인 규칙은 예치금을 납부하고, 2주에 글을 1번씩 제출하는 것\n    \n중간에 쉬어가기 위한 패스는 2번 주어졌다\n활동 기간은 6달\n2주에 1개씩 작성하면 총 12개의 글을 작성하게 된다\n2025년 3월 기준 총 약 1,000명이 참여했다\n10기 기준 글쓰기, 글쓰기 세미나, 커피챗/모각글, 큐레이션, 소모임, 100명 규모의 오프라인 모임, 대나무숲 등의 활동들이 존재\n    \n더 자세한 내용은 글또 웹페이지에 작성된 글또 소개 참고\n글또의 기수별 참여자 수는 아래 그래프를 보면 확인할 수 있다\n    \n1기를 13명으로 시작해서, 10기는 639명까지 확장했다. 4900% 성장을 이룬셈\n매번 전 기수 대비 인원이 최소 30%씩 증가했고, 참여자의 평균 40%는 다음 기수를 연장했음(6개월 뒤 리텐션 40%)\n\n\n글또를 만들고 계속 운영한 계기\n처음엔 주변 지인들이 개발 블로그를 쓰고 싶은데, 어렵다고 이야기를 들었다. 하고 싶지만 의지가 잘 생기지 않는다는 이야기를 들었고, 주변 지인들을 돕기 위해 모임을 만들기 시작했다\n손실 회피 성향 + 사회적 지지 + 책임감을 기반으로 한 모임 생성\n    \n손실 회피 성향을 자극하기 위해 예치금을 걷었고, 다른 사람들과 글쓰기를 약속하면 사회적 지직와 책임감이 생겨 글을 쓰게 될 것이라 생각했다\n기수가 지나면서 개인적인 관점에서 인생의 깨달음이 생기고, 많은 분들이 좋은 길로 나아가길 바라면서 책임감에 커뮤니티를 꾸준히 운영했다\n\n\n시간의 흐름에 따른 글또의 성장과 변화\n지금 돌이켜 생각하면 초기 / 중기 / 후기로 볼 수 있다. 대부분의 변화는 후기에 많이 있다\n초기에 글또를 참여한 분이 10기에 다시 참여하셨는데, 천지 개벽 수준이라고 말하셨다. 내가 생각해도 천지 개벽 수준이다. 많은 것들을 시도했고, 많은 문화를 만들었다. 시간이 걸린 일이다\n과거에 작성한 글또 회고 글도 지금 다시 보면 참 재미있고, 과거의 내 생각을 다시 볼 수 있어 재밌다\n    \n글또 2기 다짐글\n글또 4기 다짐글\n글또 4기 운영 회고 및 글또 5기를 준비하며 쓰는 글\n글또 10기 참여자 관점, 운영자 관점의 다짐\n\n1기-3기 : 글또의 초기\n1기\n    \n2018년 2월 ~ 7월\n글또

확인하는 것이 불편했다\n2기\n    \n2018년 11월 ~ 2019년 5월\n글또 2기(25명) 참여\n슬랙에서 활동\n수동 글 리뷰어 배정\n직무 별로 퍼실리테이터를 두고, 퍼실리테이터분들이 대화를 자연스럽게 진행할 수 있도록 했다(Thanks to 권혁우님, 민지연님, 이종호님)\nWrite the Docs Seoul : 글쓰는 개발자 모임, 글또

해야 좋을지를 고민했던 시기\n    \n회사 업무도 많았던 시기라 회사 업무에 집중했다. 커뮤니티 관점에서는 천천히 발전했다\n5기 때부터는 참여자보단 운영자 역할에 집중했다(그러다가 10기에 다시 참여자로 복귀)\n맥북을 보다가 OT 자료를 다시 봤다. 초기에 OT 자료는 30~60쪽이였다. 10기 OT 자료는 159쪽인데, 예전 OT 자료와 지금 OT 자료를 보면 나 또한 의견을 전달하는 능력이 많이 달라졌다는 것을 느낄 수 있고, 커뮤니티에 대한 고민을 정말 많이 했다는 것이 느껴진다. 참 격세지감을 느낀다. 어렸을 때의 나는 이렇게 했구나\n\n4기\n    \n2020년 3월 ~ 8월\n총 11명의 운영진(Thanks to 고석진님, 구유림님, 김지훈님, 류지환님, 마광휘님, 이상협님, 이종진님, 이창현님, 전인아님, 정민정님, 지찬규님)\n글또 로고 제작(Thanks to 김나영님)\n글또 4기(69명) 참여\n신입 멘토링 진행\n5기\n    \n2020년 11월 ~ 2021년 5월\n5, 6기 때는 운영진을 모집하지 않고 필요할 때만 도움을 구했다. 코로나 시기였고, 회사에서 업무가 너무 많았다. 회사 일도 너무 재밌어서 열심히 했다. 모빌리티 업계에서 데이터 분석, 데이터 엔지니어링, 머신러닝을 모두 할 수 있다는 것은 다시 생각해도 너무 즐거운 경험이다. 게다가 쏘카/타다의 비즈니스 모델이 달라서 데이터를 활용하는 방식이 다른데, 둘 다 경험할 수 있는 점은 다시 생각해도 감사하다. 운이 좋았다\n글또 5기(94명) 참여\n고민있어요 채널 생성 : Anonymous Bot 활용\n온라인 모임 2회\n팀별 온라인 회고\n신입 멘토링 진행\n쉼에 대한 이야기 : 쉼퍼런스 진행\n회고 모음집 제작\n6기\n    \n6기 때는 과거에 했던 것들을 반복했다. 무언가 새로운 것을 하진 않고, 지금 인원을 유지한 상태로 진행했다\n슬랙을 들어가서 채널을 보는데 이 때 운영진 채널이 없다. 이 시기에 운영진 없이 진행했나? 이건 기억이 희미해졌다. 6기까지는 별도로 운영진 회의록 템플릿이 없었다\n2021년 8월 ~ 2022년 1월\n글또 6기(132명) 참여\n기억나는 것은 6기 때 굿즈를 처음 제작했다. 이 때 처음 굿즈를 만들었고, 이 당시에 작업실에 물건 받아서 손수 포장해서 보냈던 기억이 있다. 가내 수공업을 하면서 보내는 것은 정말 어렵구나를 느꼈다\n가운데에 있는 글또 키링이 제일 비쌌던 기억이 있다. 그래도 받은 분들이 좋아했던 기억이 난다.\n\n\n2기 ~ 6기 슬랙 채널\n생성되는 모든 퍼블릭 채널에서 어떤 이야기를 하시나 보곤 했는데, 시간이 지나니 이런 것들도 있구나..! 다시 상기할 수 있다\n2~6기의 슬랙 채널만 봐도 어떤 일이 있었는지 유추할 수 있다\n점점 커뮤니티로 커지는 것이 느껴진다\n초기, 중기 땐 나도 인간적으로 덜 성숙(?)했고 일단 하면서 개선했던 것 같다. 지금 생각해보면 초기, 중기 때는 나도 20대였다. 많은 경험을 하고, 책도 읽고 그러면서 발전한 내 생각이 글또에도 반영된 것 같다\n\n\n7기 : 글또의 후기 시작, 마치 르네상스\n이 시기부터 큰 변화의 시작이 보였다. 참여하는 분들이 100명이 넘어가면서 고민해야 할 부분이 많아졌고, 서로 더 많이 교류할 수 있도록 도와주는 것이 필요했다\n    \n개인적으론 이 시기엔 퇴사를 앞두고 있었다. 퇴사 전에 할 일들이 참 많았고, 커뮤니티 일도 많았다\n7기를 대비하기 위해 습관 형성에 대한 논문, 서적들을 학습했고, 조직을 어떻게 꾸릴 것인가에 대한 것도 고민했다\n사실 이 시기부터 후기가 아니라 중기로 봐야하나? 싶은데 일단 후기로 작성해본다.\n2022년 5월 ~ 2022년 10월\n글또 7기(182명) 참여\n    \n운영진 8명(Thanks to 김정희님, 김진환님, 박상오님, 이민경님, 이상협님, 이찬주님, 정종윤님, 조동민님)\n이 시기부터 운영진 활동을 더 구체화했다. 어떻게 해야 운영진분들도 동기부여를 잘 받을 수 있을까?를 고민했다\n익명 슬랙 메세지 전송을 위한 대나무숲 봇 개발(Thanks to 정종윤님)\n    \n종윤님의 개발 과정 글\n같은 직군별 커피챗\n글또 내부 컨퍼런스 (글또콘)\n    \n글또콘 발표 자료\n\n운영진 활동의 체계화\n과거 기수엔 운영진이 있었어도 체계적이지 않았다. 왜 체계적이지 않았는가 생각해보면 나 또한 체계적으로 일을 한다는 것에 대해 경험이 없었기 때문이다. 쏘카에서 팀 리드, 디렉터 역할을 하면서 조직의 문서 작성, 체계적인 구조, 어떻게 상호 협력할 것인가 등을 고민했던 부분이 크게 도움이 되었다\n쏘카의 경험을 기반으로 운영진 활동 또한 개편했고, 매 기수 구조적인 변화를 조금씩 만들었다\n    \n이 때 Ground Rule을 만들고, 이걸 계속 활용했다\n대표적인 Ground Rule은 다음과 같다\n        \n운영진 내에서 모이면 노션에 기록을 남긴다(템플릿 2-3개가 제공)\n운영진 내에서 만들어지는 설문, 발표 자료 등은 하나의 구글 드라이브에 저장한다\n너무 열심히 하지 말기. 많은 것을 동시에 하려고 하지 않는다. 딱 1가지만 해보기. 회사 일에 집중하면서 시간이 날 때 글또 운영진 활동을 한다\n            \n만약 동시에 많은 것을 하려고 하면, 성윤이 이를 억제할 수 있음\n내가 제일 중요하게 생각한 관점인데, 너무 열심히 하면 반발심으로 번아웃이 심하게 올 수 있다고 생각했다. 그래서 역설적이지만 너무 열심히 하지 말라고 이야기해왔다. 이건 나에게도 하는 말이다\n글또 운영진 활동을 하면서 “즐겁게” 하고 있나 생각해보기. 즐겁게 하고 있지 않다면 잘못되고 있다고 생각하기. 즐겁게 하면서 활동하는 것이 우리의 핵심\n인생에서 갑자기 힘든 일이 생길 수 있고, 그 시기에 무리하게 일을 하지 말고 사람들에게 자신의 상황을 공유하고 회복하는 것에 집중하기\n언제든 고민이 있다면 성윤에게 DM하기. 무엇이어도 좋으니 고민을 들을게요\n당연한 것처럼 보이지만, 막상 상황이 되면 당연하지 않기에 항상 강조했고, 안전하다는 것을 알려주고 싶었다\n커뮤니티의 비전을 이 때 다시 잡았다. 결국 글또를 통해 내가 전하고 싶은 가치가 무엇인가? 계속 생각했고, 마침내 다음과 같은 문장을 작성할 수 있었다\n    \n글을 작성하는 개발 직군분들이 모여서, 좋은 영향을 주고 서로 같이 자랄 수 있는 커뮤니티\n운영진 전체 모임은 1~2달에 1번만 진행하고 모였을 땐 일 이야기는 후딱 끝내고(?) 같이 대화를 하거나 즐거운 경험을 하도록 하려고 했다. 회사처럼 일 이야기만 하는 회의를 안하고 싶었다(근데 나중에는 나보다 다른 분들이 글또 운영에 대한 이야기를 더 많이 하자고 하셔서 그렇게 했었다)\n\n대나무숲\n살다보면 고민이 생긴다. 아 이거 어떻게 해야할까? 모르겠다 싶은 그런 고민\n    \n이런 고민들을 어딘가 나눌 공간이 있으면 좋지 않을까?란 생각을 했고, 글또 내에서 만들었다\n기존엔 만들어진 앱을 사용하다가 종윤님이 대나무숲을 만들어 주셨다\n        \n임금님 귀는 당나귀 귀! 대나무숲 슬랙 앱 만들기\n익명 채널은 항상 트레이드 오프가 있다. 사람들이 일반적으로 아는 익명 채널처럼 쓰면 점점 처음 의도와 변질될 의도가 있다\n그래서 처음에 명확하게 대나무숲을 어떻게 써야 하는지 가이드를 드렸다\n        \n욕이나 반말은 불가능\n다른 사람을 공격하는 말투는 이유 고지 후 삭제\n이렇게 운영하니까, 따뜻한 익명 채널이 되었다\n    \n실제로 많은 고민들을 나누고, 익명이 아니라 실명으로 댓글을 다는 분도 생기고, 그러다가 커피챗도 하는 경우가 있었다\n대나무숲에 글을 작성한 사람을 로깅할 것인가에 대한 문제도 논의했는데, 이걸 로깅하는 것 자체가 불안함이 생길 수 있다고 생각해서 구성원들을 믿고 로깅을 하지 않았다. 지금까지 문제가 된 케이스는 거의 없다.\n많은 분들이 대나무숲에서 공감을 얻는다고 말하셨다. 따뜻한 공간을 만들기 위해 익명 채널을 만들고, 잘 운영하는 것이 핵심이였다\n나는 항상 실명으로 남기곤 했는데, 사실 나도 익명으로 올린 적이 있다\n    \n그냥 샴푸를 사야하는데 탈모용 샴푸가 있나 싶어 물어봤다(사실 저 탈모 없는데 이거 올리려고 10기 때 올려봄)\n\n10기 때 성장에 대해 고민이 있다는 글에 작성한 댓글\n\n\n오프라인 모임\n코로나가 끝나가서, 다 같이 모여보자!라는 생각을 가지며 오프라인 모임인 글또콘을 준비했다\n컬리에서 준비했는데, 그 때 참 잘 준비해주셔서 잘 수행했다. 그리고 10기 데이터 반상회 때 다시 컬리를 찾아서 반가웠다\n글또콘에 다녀온 직후에 작성한 글\n\n\n굿즈\n6기 때 굿즈 만들 때 고생해서(?) 이번엔 좀 더 편하게 만들고 싶었다\n운영진이신 김진환님께서 도움을 주셔서 만들 수 있었다\n    \n풀 패키지로 만들었는데, 그 이후엔 이렇게 만들지 못해서 아쉽다\n비용이 많이 드는데, 인원이 많아져서 감당하기 어렵다고 판단했다\n굿즈를 만드는 운영진이 계속 있어야 하는데, 암묵지가 개인에게 귀속될 경우에 대대손손 유지가 되지 않는다. 나도 어느정도 알고 있었지만, 더 체계화를 해야겠다고 다짐했던 시기\n만약 다시 한다면 연예인 팬클럽처럼 가입 후에 제작해서 전달하면 좋을 것 같다. 굿즈는 소속감을 줄 수 있는 매개체다\n진환님이 작성해주신 글또

   \n자신이 살아온 과정을 작성하는 미션으로 자신에 대해 생각해보는 기회를 드리고 싶었다\n참고로 이 과정에서 잘 작성했다, 잘 작성하지 못했다란 가치 판단은 하지 않고 주어진 기준 이상으로 작성했는지를 봤다. 주어진 요구 조건을 명확히 지키는가? 작성된 내용을 지킨 분들만 합격을 드렸다\n        \n불합격은 대부분 글자수를 미달하거나, 완성하지 못했거나, 권한을 풀지 않은 경우 발생했다.\n불합격을 많이 드리는 것이 내게 불편한 마음이였다. 그래서 나는 최대한 기회를 드리고 싶었다. 불합격이 많은 요즘 시대에 내가 합격을 드려서, 참여자분들의 자존감에 조금이나마 도움이 되면 좋지 않을까? 라는 생각을 했다. 그럼에도 불구하고 기준은 명확히 설정해서 그 기준을 지켰다. 그 기준을 통과하지 못한 분들에게 불합격 메일을 보내는 것은 여전히 내게 힘든 기억이다. 인원이 많아질수록 이 괴로운 경험이 커진다.\n운영진분들에게 공유드린 삶의 지도 합격과 불합격의 기준\n\n\n운영진 활동\n운영진도 많아지면서, 커뮤니티에서 내가 누구를 케어해야 할까? 생각하면 운영진이라고 생각했다. 운영진분들이 나아가서 더 많은 분들에게 도움을 줄 것이라 생각했다\n커뮤니티를 오래 운영하면서 느낀 점은 자발적으로 돕는 선한 의도가 있어도 장기적으로 가는 것이 참 어렵다. 그리고 열심히 하겠다고 했다가 못했을 때 머쓱해지는 것이 있고, 그래서 더 나타나지 않는 경우가 있다. 이 머쓱함을 모르는 사람들은 그냥 활동을 안했다고 생각하는 경우가 있다. 나는 이런 상황이 건전하지 않다고 생각했고, 누구나 힘들 수 있고 그런 시기를 말해도 문제가 안되도록 운영진을 꾸리고 싶었다\n    \n운영진 OT에서 당부한 이야기\n위에 7기 그라운드 룰과 맥락은 같지만, 더 잘 전달하려고 했다\n\n아, 그리고 9기 운영진 MT도 다녀왔고, 마지막엔 다 같이 사진도 찍었다. 이것도 다 추억이니 남겨둔다(혹시 자신의 얼굴을 가리고 싶은 분이 있다면 연락주셔요)\n\n\n\n세계관 재구축\n기존에는 글또의 세계관이라는 것이 따로 없었고, 채널을 구분하는 prefix(1_, 2_, 3_ 이런 느낌)만 있었다. 그러나 사람들이 더 많아지면서 각각의 prefix에도 의미를 부여해야 더 이해하기 쉽다고 생각했다\n    \n글또는 여러 사람들이 참여하는 큰 공동체라 생각했고, 각 공동체는 직무 별로 마을이 있다고 생각했다. 그래서 빌리지 채널을 만들었고, 이 빌리지는 같은 직무가 있는 채널이다.\n        \n그리고 빌리지 내에 코어 채널이 있다. 코어 채널은 7~10명 정도 되는 인원이 같이 있고, 글을 제출하는 공간이다\n코어 채널에서 서로 글을 조금씩 보고, 빌리지 채널로 확장되길 바라는 마음으로 지었다\n직무 별 오프라인 모임은 빌리지의 모임이기에 빌리지 반상회라고 지었다. 반상회라고 하면 요즘은 잘 안하지만, 아파트에서 반상회를 진행하는 것을 상상하며 서로 안건에 대해 이야기도 하고, 어떻게 지내나, 음식도 나눠 먹고 등을 생각하면서 지었다\n소모임 채널(4_)은 소모임 채널이라고 정의했다. 이후 10기 때 소모임 채널도 의미를 더 부여했다\n아래는 빌리지 반상회 소개 글. 운영진이 다 진행하는 것이 아니라 반상회 준비위를 새로 꾸려서 진행했다\n\n\n봇의 진화\n개인적으로 8기 때 “또봇”의 탄생이 많은 사람들이 편해지고, 할 수 있는 것들이 많아졌다. 은찬님이 참 감사하다\n그 전에는 글을 작성한 후, 슬랙에 전송한 후에 제출 이모지를 누르면 제출 이모지 여부에 따라 글 제출을 확인했다\n    \n그러나 봇이 생기면서 아예 또봇을 통해 글을 제출할 수 있고, 데이터를 더 잘 관리할 수 있게 되었다\n처음엔 글 제출 기능만 있었는데 10기 때는 더 많은 기능을 담당하고, 앞단에서 데이터를 저장하는 역할도 하고 있다\n    \n글또에 참여하는 분들이 봇을 보면 참 신기하게 생각하는데, 그 중에 대표적인 친구가 또봇이다. 또봇 스티커도 만들어서 오프라인 모임 때 공유하고 있다\n또봇에 대한 내용은 은찬님의 글을 공유\n    \n개발자 글쓰기 커뮤니티는 ‘슬랙 봇’을 어떻게 사용하고 있을까?\n카테고리 수집하려다 슬랙 봇까지 개발해버린 건에 대하여…\n대표적으로 할 수 있는 글 제출 과정은 아래와 같다\n\n\n\n  \n또한 생일 축하 봇도 만들었다\n    \n생일이란 것을 중요하게 생각하는 사람이라, 생일 축하를 해왔다.\n기존에는 생일이 기록된 시트에서 보고 수작업으로 했으나, 재휘님이 운영진 채널에 하루에 1번씩 메시지가 오도록 해줬다\n그걸 보고 생일 명단을 확인하고, 채널에 공유한다. 생일 짤도 한 30개 정도 저장되어 있다.\n이렇게 생일 축하하는 과정을 통해 따뜻함이 전해지길 바랐다. 우연히 만난 것이 아니니까\nApps Script를 사용해 구현했다. 아래는 운영진 채널에 도착하는 내용. 운영진 두분이 생일이셔서 운영진끼리 생일 축하도 하고, 다른 채널에도 공유했다\n\n\n글쓰기 교육\n커뮤니티를 5년 정도 운영하니 사람들이 겪는 반복적인 패턴이 보였고, 그 패턴들은 과거의 나도 경험했던 요소였다. 그래서 이걸 어떻게 도움을 드릴까? 고민하다가 내가 글을 어떻게 작성하는지, 많이 겪는 고충들을 공유했다\n    \n이 때 진행한 내용을 토대로 10기 할 때 인프런에 강의를 출시했다. 블로그 페이지뷰 300만이 알려주는 “실용주의 기술 블로그 글쓰기”\n좋은 글을 쓴다는 것은 하루 아침에 되지 않는다. 꾸준함이 수반되어야 하고, 좋은 글을 하나만 쓰는 것이 아니라 꾸준히 쓰면서 점점 글의 역량이 올라가야 한다\n        \n그와 더불어서 SEO도 챙기는 것이 필요한데, SEO에 대해 많은 분들이 모른다. 그냥 글만 쓰고 누군가 내 글을 찾아주면 좋겠다고 생각한다. 물론 검색 엔진이 잘 색인해주면 좋겠지만, 블로그 운영 초반일 때는 SEO에 대한 전략도 가지고 있으면 좋다\n포트폴리오로 활용하고 싶은데 글을 잘 작성하지 못하는 분들이 종종 조급해 하는 경우가 있는데, 처음부터 다 잘하려는 것보다 점진적으로 가면 된다고 말씀드렸다\n글을 작성하거나, 어떤 일을 할 때 대부분 마음가짐, 멘탈 관리가 중요하다\n이 내용을 나중에 데보션에서 강의했었다\n이 강의를 처음에 하지 않고, 3회차 제출 후에 진행했다.\n    \n이렇게 한 이유는 강의를 처음에 들으면 “당연한 것 아니야?”라고 생각할 수 있기 때문이다. 대부분 그렇다. 근데 막상 하면 힘들다\n그래서 애초에 3번 글을 쓰면서 글쓰기가 좀 어렵구나라는 것을 인지하고 => 그 때 이야기를 하는 것이 효과적이라 생각했다\n문제 상황을 겪기 전까지는 공감하지 못할 수 있다고 생각해서 일부러 이런 방식으로 강의를 진행했다\n많은 분들이 언급하는 글쓰기의 어려움은 아래와 같다. 강의 내용 중 일부다. 글또에 오래 참여하신 분들은 이 어려움에 대해서는 이제 얼추 해결된 것 같다\n\n\n\n9기\n2023년 11월 ~ 2024년 5월\n글또 9기(452명)\n    \n25명의 운영진(Thanks to 강나영님, 강승현님, 김은찬님, 김재휘님, 김정희님, 김준홍님, 류지환님, 박수민님, 배지훈님, 성연찬님, 송경근님, 송민혜님, 신해나라님, 이찬주님, 임정님, 임지훈님, 정이태님, 정종윤님, 정현수님, 조동민님, 조재우님, 지정수님, 채정현님, 최현구님)\n4명의 커뮤니티 매니저(강나영님, 김정희님, 조동민님, 채정현님) : 운영진들의 활동을 즐겁게 하려면 어떻게 해야할까?를 고민하는 파트\n\n봇, 시스템 개발\n데이터 파이프라인 구축(To BigQuery)\n    \n또봇은 데이터를 스프레드시트로 저장하는데, 참여자들의 유저 로그(슬랙 데이터)를 분석하는 것이 좋다고 판단했다. 그래서 슬랙의 Export 기능을 사용해 BigQuery로 데이터를 추출했다\n그러나 슬랙 데이터의 문제는 이모지 데이터에 있다. 이모지를 언제 했는지에 대한 시간 데이터는 없고, 추출을 시도할 때 최신의 상태만 제공한다. 스냅샷 데이터라고 볼 수 있다\n        \n스냅샷이여도 사용할 수 있기 때문에, BigQuery에 적재해서 글또의 핵심 지표를 확인했다\nCRM Push 메세지 봇 데달부 개발\n    \n위 데이터 파이프라인이 구축되었으니, 사람들에게 가치를 제공해줄 수 있다고 생각했다\n글또에서 활동을 얼마나 했는지 보여주면 좋겠다는 생각을 했고, 실시간은 아니지만 주기적으로 메시지를 전달해도 좋을 것 같았다. 그래서 운영진분들이 개발을 해주셨고, 사람들에게 그동안 활동을 정리해서 공유했다\n이 부분은 9기에 실험적으로 시도해서, 10기에도 진행했다\n운영 자동화를 위한 글팽이 개발\n    \n사람이 많아지면 간단하게 사람을 태그하는 것도 일이다. 운영진의 수도 많아져서 하나씩 다 체크하는 것이 어려웠다\n슬랙의 메시지에 이모지를 안한 사람을 자동으로 태그하는 운영 유틸성 봇인 글팽이을 만들었다\n제출 글을 확인해주는 글빼미 개발\n    \n글또는 1,000자 이상의 글을 작성해야 하는 기준이 있다. 그러나 글을 제출할 때 보면 글자수가 800자인 경우도 존재한다. 이럴 경우엔 제출 글로 인정하지 못한다.\n건수가 많진 않지만, 직접 해왔는데 운영의 부담으로 다가왔다. 그래서 이를 해결하기 위해 제출된 글을 보고 글자수를 확인하는 글빼미가 개발되었다\n이어져서 글빼미는 밑에 나오는 LLM 기반 큐레이션과 합쳐져서 LLM 기반 글 피드백 시스템으로 진화한다\nLLM 기반 큐레이션\n    \n참여자가 450명이 넘어간다는 것은 2주에 제출되는 글이 최소 400개는 된다는 말이다. 이걸 큐레이션 크루분들이 다 보면서 확인하기엔 시간이 많이 걸린다\n이것도 운영의 이슈기 때문에 LLM을 사용해 자동화를 진행했다. 제출된 글들을 점수화해서 기준에 맞는 것들 위주로 글을 보고 큐레이션을 진행했다\n큐레이션 과정은 아래 글에 자세히 나와있다\n        \n큐레이션은 어떻게 이루어질까요?\n글또 웹페이지 제작\n    \n기존엔 내 노션을 사용해서 글또 소식을 알렸는데, 글또의 웹페이지를 만들었다\n9기 중후반에 만들었고, 이걸 기반으로 10기 때는 글또에서 진행되는 여러 내용을 블로그로 남겨두고 싶었다. 글로 남겨두면 운영진분들은 자신의 경험이 되고, 참여자분들에겐 추억으로 남을 수 있을 것이라 믿었다\n그 외에도 사람들의 인터랙션을 그래프 관점으로 봤다. 그래프를 집계하면 Tabular가 되지만, 그래프로 시각화하는 것이 꽤 괜찮다는 것을 느꼈다\n봇, 시스템 개발에선 운영진분들이 거의 다 구현을 해주셨다. 나는 방향성이나 의사결정을 해야하는 것들 위주로 정리했다. 이렇게 봇, 시스템이 발전하는 것은 나에게도 영감을 주었고, 글또 참여자분들에게도 영감을 주었다(매 기수 OT 때마다 봇의 기능이 확장되기에)\n봇의 세계관\n\n\n사람들의 연결\n글또의 제일 핵심 목표는 글을 잘 작성하는 것이다. 두번째 목표는 사람들과 연결되는 것. 어떻게 해야 연결을 더 잘 시켜줄 수 있을까?를 고민했다\n같은 직무 내 랜덤 커피챗\n    \n글또는 자유롭게 커피챗을 하고 인증하는 문화가 존재한다. 많은 분들이 커피챗을 자발적으로 하고, 커피챗을 모집하기도 한다. 처음이 어렵지만, 그 이후엔 자주 참여하는 패턴을 보인다\n이 자율 커피챗도 잘 동작하지만, 커피챗 참여가 주저되는 것도 사실이다. 그래서 글또에서 랜덤 커피챗을 매칭한다. 이 때 제일 어려운 것은 조편성이다\n거리, 연차, 주제 등 다양한 요구 사항이 있다. 이 때 모든 요구 조건을 다 수용하는 것은 어려워서 연차나 소재 위주로 조를 나눴다\n직무 별 오프라인 빌리지 반상회\n    \n오프라인 반상회 프로세스가 구체화가 되었고, 이 프로세스를 기반으로 10회 넘는 행사를 진행했다\n이제 100~150명 규모의 행사는 쉽게 운영할 수 있다. 제일 어려운 것은 장소 섭외다. 장소만 잘 섭외되면 그 이후는 컨셉 회의, 우리가 행사에서 바라는 것을 기반으로 확장할 수 있다\n커뮤니티의 행사에 도움이 되길 바라는 마음에 프로세스를 공유\n        \n글또 오프라인 모임 프로세스 템플릿\n\n그 외에도 Activation 크루에서 글또하우스라는 이름으로 사람들과 고민 상담소를 진행했다. 처음엔 나는 조금만 참여하면서 살짝 살짝 관여했다. 모두 다 내가 관여한다면 스스로 하는 것이 줄어들 수 있기 때문에(내가 이야기를 하면 그 결정으로 갈 확률이 높기에) 자율성을 드리기 위해 적당히 관여했다\n회고 소규모 모임도 했던 것이 떠오른다. 소규모 모임이여도 작은 모임이 점점 더 커질 수 있다고 믿기 때문에 어떤 것이여도 괜찮다고 운영진분들에게 계속 말했던 기억이 난다\n\n회사들과 협업\n회사들과 협업도 늘어났다. 열심히 사는 사람들이 모인 커뮤니티라서 교육이나 책 관련 후원이 많았다\n유데미에서 강의를 제공해주셨고, 코딩 테스트 플랫폼인 코드트리에서 체험권을 제공해주셨다\n그 외에도 빌리지 반상회를 위해 다양한 기업들이 공간을 빌려주셨다\n    \n채널톡, 우아한형제들, 팀 스파르타, 잡플래닛 담당자분들 모두 감사합니다\n\n\n10기\n2024년 9월 ~ 2025년 3월\n글또 10기(639명)\n    \n34명의 운영진(Thanks to 강나영님, 강승현님, 곽승예님, 곽희진님, 금정민님, 김은찬님, 김재휘님, 김정희님, 김준성님, 김해인님, 류지환님, 박건희님, 박수민님, 배지훈님, 성연찬님, 송경근님, 송민혜님,

신설했고 나머지는 기존에 있던 크루였다\n    \n(크루 : 운영진의 팀을 의미)\n컨텐츠 크루를 만든 것은 웹페이지가 생겼기 때문에, 컨텐츠를 추가하고 싶었다. 기억이 선명하게 남아있게 하고 싶었다\n커뮤니티 in 커뮤니티 크루는 4채널에 대한 Best Practice를 보여주는 크루다. 4채널을 만든 분들에게 4장님이란 명칭을 부여하고, 어떻게 해야 커뮤니티를 잘 운영할 수 있을지 알려드렸다\n        \n운영진에서 운영하는 대표 채널인 다진마늘(목표를 다지자)을 운영했고, 나는 커뮤니티를 어떻게 잘 운영할 수 있을지에 대한 교육을 진행했다\n실제로 다진마늘에 참여하신 분들이 이후 글또 활동이 활발해지는 데이터를 확인하고 추후에 다진마늘은 기존 유저의 채널로 만들고, 마늘쫑이라는 신규 멤버를 위한 채널을 만들었다. 마늘쫑에서 신규 멤버들끼리 온보딩을 하고 다진마늘로 보내는 방식이다(다진마늘 채널은 월별로 모집을 하고 있다)\n각 크루들의 역할\n    \n또봇/자동화 크루 : 또봇 고도화 및 자동화 시스템 개발(글팽이, 종이비행기, 포인트 시스템, 생일 알람)\n모임 크루 : 오프라인 반상회 모임 운영\nCRM 크루 : 글또분들의 참여를 독려하는 메시지 개발\nActivation 크루 : 커뮤니티의 활성화를 위한 Activation 실행. 다 같이 썰매를 타러 가기도 하고, 팟캐스트도 만들어서 배포하고 있다\n컨텐츠 크루 : 글또의 블로그에 컨텐츠 발행\n큐레이션 크루 : 글또의 제출 글 큐레이션 운영 및 글 피드백 자동화(글빼미)\n커뮤니티 in 커뮤니티 크루 : 글또의 소모임(4채널) 활성화를 위한 Best Practice 채널 운영(다진마늘)\n\n크루 외에도 TF 목적으로 어떤 집단이 리텐션이 높은가?라는 질문을 분석하기 위한 프로젝트이글 TF도 있다. 관련 내용은 곧 글또 블로그에 올라갈 예정이다. 어떤 사람들이 많이 활동하는지를 데이터를 통해 알아볼 수 있었다(Thanks to 곽승예님, 김해인님, 송해인님)\n10기 운영진 MT도 다녀왔다. 이 나이에 MT라니! 라는 생각도 했는데, 운영진분들이 가자고 하셔서 다녀왔다. 참 고마운 분들이다\n    \n운영진분들에게 감사를 표하기 위해 글또 로고가 박힌 후드와 NFC 명함을 선물로 드렸다\n\n\n오리엔테이션\n오리엔테이션에 정말 많은 공을 들였다\n    \nOT 때 많은 동기부여를 주는 것이 제일 중요하다고 생각했다. 제품으로 치면 제품의 온보딩으로 볼 수 있다\n많은 고민을 했고, 일반적인 커뮤니티 소개가 아니라 커뮤니티를 만든 “나”부터 소개를 시작했다. 나의 특성이 뭐고, 내 인생 비전이 무엇이고, 글또도 그 비전을 이루는 과정에서 만들었다는 이야기.\n그리고 참여자들이 어떻게 되면 좋겠다는 내 바람을 공유하면서, 비전 소개, 핵심 활동 소개\n활동 소개를 하면서 글또의 다양한 봇들을 소개\n참여하는 분들이 겪을 수 있는 상황, 마음가짐을 미리 제시하고 어떻게 활동하면 좋을지 활동 지침도 드렸다\n모든 것의 변화는 누군가 만들지 않고, 자신이 만든다는 메시지도 제시한다. “변화는 다른 사람이 만들어주지 않고 자신이 만듭니다”\n10기 OT 자료는 159쪽이나 되었다. 1시간 10~20분 정도 진행되지만 단순히 내용 전달이 아니라 스토리를 담은 OT로 만들었다. 실제로 들어보면 사람들의 동기부여가 올라갔다고 들었고, 기수를 연장하는 분들도 지루하지 않도록 내용을 매 기수 바꿨다\n10기 OT 자료를 그대로 공유하는 것은 어렵고, 일부를 아래에 붙여본다\n    \nOT에 참여했던 분들은 다시 생각해보는 기회가 되면 좋겠고, 커뮤니티에 관심이 있는 분들에겐 영감이 되길\n\n\n따뜻함과 유익함 전달하기\n커뮤니티가 잘 운영되려면 운영자의 노력이 꽤 필요하다. 필요하지 않다고는 말 못하겠다\n    \n나는 내가 잘할 수 있는 방식으로 따뜻함과 유익함을 전달하려고 했다\n나는 다른 사람을 생각해서 메시지를 작성하는 것에 부담을 느끼지 않고, 내용을 보고 정리하면서 내 의견을 정리하는 것을 즐긴다\n그래서 공지사항 메시지를 꾸준히 작성하고(마감 하루 전의 응원 메시지) 자료를 보고 유익한 자료가 있다면 채널에 공유했다\n회사에서도 팀장이나 대표가 모범을 보여야 그걸 따라서 구성원들도 실행한다는 말이 있다. 이 개념처럼 나도 어떤 것을 하는지, 왜 하는지를 공유하고 싶었다\n    \n근데 다시 봐도 내가 말이 많은 것 같다\n\n\n\n\n\n\n봇, 시스템 개발\n데이터 수집 역할 : 슬랙 Export -> 또봇이 데이터 수집(Event Driven Architecture)\n    \n슬랙 봇에서 소켓 모드로 변경하면 슬랙에서 발생하는 모든 이벤트의 데이터를 수집할 수 있다\n참여자들의 행동 데이터를 수집할 수 있게 되었고, 이런 데이터를 수집해 바로 BigQuery로 보냈다\n유저의 행동이 발생하면 또봇이 받아서 넘기는 형태\n정확하지는 않지만 카프카처럼 앞단의 데이터를 받아서 다른 곳으로 넘기는 역할을 했다\n이 방식이 생겨서 또 여러가지가 가능했다. 밑에 나오는 포인트 시스템도 소켓 모드가 있어서 가능했다\n포인트 시스템, 종이비행기\n    \n은찬님과 구의역 탐탐에서 엄청 이야기를 하면서 설득했던 기억이 난다\n10기 때 새로운 시스템을 도입하고 싶었다. 나도 즐겁게 커뮤니티를 운영하려면 어떻게 해야할까? 나의 마음이 즐거워야 커뮤니티도 즐겁게 운영할 수 있어서 생각하다가 포인트 시스템과 종이비행기를 생각했다\n포인트 시스템은 글을 제출할 때 점수를 얻는 시스템이고, 공지사항을 확인하거나 커피챗 인증을 할 때마다 얻을 수 있다\n        \n글을 끊기지 않고 연속적으로 글을 작성하면 포인트를 많이 받을 수 있게 된다\n또한 특정 시즌엔 포인트 2배 시스템도 진행했다\n포인트로 뭘 할 수 있냐?라는 질문도 할 수 있지만 자신의 커뮤니티 내 활동을 이렇게 숫자로 보는 것이 큰 힘이 있다\n이걸 위해 게임 기획 책을 보면서 레벨업에 필요한 경험치는 어떻게 산출하나 공부했다. 지수적으로 갈 것인지 로그처럼 할 것인지 등 여러 의사 결정이 있었다. 그리고 그걸 경험하는 사람들이 어떤 감정일지 생각했다\n종이비행기는 일종의 편지다\n        \n슬랙 DM으로도 감사함을 표시할 수 있지만, 슬랙 DM은 내용이 더 쌓이면 흘러가기 마련이다\n그래서 누군가에게 감사함을 표시할 수 있는 종이비행기를 만들었다. 슬랙의 계정을 토큰으로 받아 웹페이지에 들어가면 자신에게 받은 종이비행기와 보낸 종이비행기를 확인할 수 있다\n따뜻함을 명시적으로 전달하는 매개체로 종이비행기를 사용했다\n또봇의 홈 탭\n    \n공지사항에 :noti-check: 이모지를 남길 경우 포인트, 글 제출시 포인트, 커피챗 인증시 포인트 등 다양하게 설계\n\n종이 비행기\n\n\n\n커피챗 인증 과정 고도화\n\n\n\n  \n글팽이\n    \n운영 자동화를 위한 글팽이도 계속 진화했다\n특정 유저 그룹을 태그하는 기능 : 예를 들어 @운영진_모임 을 하면 해당 사람들을 대신 소환해준다. 이게 유료 기능에선 제공하는 기능인데, 유료기도 하고 추가하는 과정이 편하지 않았다. 그래서 스프레드시트 기반으로 유저를 설정하면, 태그를 해주는 기능을 개발했다\n최근에는 랜덤 선택 기능도 추가했다. 어떤 활동을 할 때 랜덤으로 뽑고 싶을 때 활용할 수 있다. 모임 참여자를 선택할 때, 카드깡을 할 때(?) 사용한다\n태그한 후, 쓰레드에 @글팽이 체크 라고 하면 태그 대상 중 이모지를 하지 않은 사람에게 댓글을 달아달라고 한다\n\n\n\n  \n모두 반응했다면, 모두 반응했다고 응답한다\n\n\n\n  \n글빼미\n    \n기존엔 작성한 글의 글자수만 확인해주던 글빼미가 글을 피드백을 해주는 능력까지 생겼다\n종윤님과 지훈님의 협업으로 만들 수 있었다. 이 피드백은 내가 4기 때부터 바랬던 기능인데 10기 때 드디어 꿈이 실현되었다\n자세한 내용은 다음 두 글에서 확인할 수 있다\n        \n🦉 글또의 제출 글 검수 자동화 봇: 글빼미를 소개합니다!\n🦉 LLM 기반 블로그 피드백 자동화 : 글빼미의 피드백은 어떻게 이루어질까요\n참고로 지옥맛 피드백은 정말 칭찬 하나 없다. 무서운 피드백이다..\n이 글을 제출하고 받은 피드백(매운맛) : 보통 매운맛도 날카롭게 피드백을 하는데 다행히 따뜻했다\n\n지니\n    \n기존의 데달부에서 이름을 지니로 바꾸었고(과거의 BigQuery 추출 봇이 지니였다) 데이터 파이프라인을 고도화했다\n스프레드시트의 데이터를 BigQuery로 옮기는 코드를 작성했고, 그 과정에서 Airflow를 활용했다. 데이터 분석가 운영진분들이 Airflow를 사용해보고 싶어하셔서, 이걸 한번 사용하는 것도 괜찮겠다 싶어서 채택했다. 그 과정에서 스프레드시트 => BigQuery로 멱등하게 데이터를 추출하려면 어떻게 해야할지?에 대한 질문을 조동민님에게 계속 드렸다(나의 하드 트레이닝을 받으셔서 Airflow에 익숙해지셨다..ㅎ..)\n그리고 복주머니라는 이름으로 설날 전에 메시지를 보냈다. 받은 분들이 따뜻함을 느끼셨고, 2번째 하다보니 더 익숙해지는 것을 보일 수 있었다\n복주머니 관련 글도 곧 글또 블로그에 올라갈 예정이다\n\n\n회사들과 협업\n10기 때도 회사들과 협업을 진행했다\n    \n길벗과 한빛미디어에서 책을 후원해주셔서 사람들에게 책을 볼 수 있는 기회를 드렸다\n인프런과 협업해서 30% 쿠폰을 모두 다 받을 수 있게 해주었다\n코드트리는 한번 더 협업을 진행해서 알고리즘 테스트를 경험할 수 있게 해주었다\n모두 감사합니다\n튜링의 사과와 협업해서, 좋은 공간을 활용할 수 있었다\n    \n많은 분들이 이번 주 튜사가서 공부하실 분? 이런 내용을 보기도 하고, 튜링의 사과에서 모여서 각자 글쓰기(모각글)도 진행했다\n그 외에도 슬라이스와 협업해서 운영진분들의 NFC 명함을 제작했다\n    \n슬라이스 블로그 글\n\n데이터 기반 의사결정\n본업이 데이터 과학자인데 데이터를 부분적으로만 사용하고 있었다. 더 데이터를 잘 살펴보겠다는 다짐을 하며  BI 대시보드를 만들었고, 핵심 지표를 보면서 의사 결정을 진행했다\nBigQuery에서 스프레드시트로 데이터를 Export하는 것이 쉽기 때문에 스프레드시트로 BI를 구축했다\n아래와 같은 형태로 대시보드를 구축했는데, 자세한 내용은 올해 데이터야놀자 때 계속..\n\n\n\n운영자 관점 : 글또 운영의 경험과 배움\n이 부분은 떠오르는 것 위주로 기록. 엄청 정제된 글이 아니라 의식의 흐름으로 지금 떠오르는 내용을 작성한다\n\n커뮤니티 운영에 대해 떠오르는 생각\n커뮤니티는 힘이 있다\n    \n다정함도 힘이 있다. 아이유님의 뮤비인 Love wins all을 보면 대혐오의 시대에 그래도 사랑이 있으면 좋겠다는 메시지를 남긴다. 나 또한 이런 시기에 다정한 공간을 만들고 싶었다\n그러나 커뮤니티는 지속적으로 운영하는 것은 에너지가 많이 든다\n1주일에 2~30시간 넘게 글또를 위해 사용했다. 카톡이나 인스타보다 더 많이 접속한다\n에너지가 많이 들기 때문에 운영자의 멘탈 관리가 중요하다\n    \n커뮤니티에선 운영자들의 멘탈, 상황이 중요하다\n운영진도 여기에 포함되지만, 운영진이 아닌 커뮤니티를 이끄는 제일 권한이 많은 사람의 멘탈 관리가 필요하다\n운영진이 있어도 외롭게 느껴질 수도 있다. 그럴 때 너무 혼자 있는 것보단 운영자도 운영진과 같이 이야기를 나누는 것이 필요하다. 누구나 살다보면 힘든 시기가 있으니까\n운영진이 생각할 때 즐겁고, 재밌는 것을 해야한다. 그러고 이렇게 해야한다는 것을 운영진에게 잘 전달하면 된다. 그래야 지속성이 생긴다\n기수제로 바꿔서 동아리처럼 운영할 수도 있지만, 누군가가 몇 년동안 꾸준히 운영하는 것도 중요하다고 생각해서 계속 운영했다. 그리고 나의 의지를 받을 분이 없기도 했다\n    \n실제로 이 시기에 대기업에서 가업 승계를 어떻게 하는지, 후계자 양성을 어떻게 하는지, 대표를 어떻게 뽑는지 등을 많이 찾아봤다. 외부 CEO가 와서 성공한 케이스가 있는지 등\n프로세스의 중요성 : 문서화, 템플릿\n    \n프로세스를 만들면, 그 이후에 드는 에너지를 줄일 수 있다\n그리고 행사를 운영할 때, 어떤 작업을 할 때 반복적으로 사용할 수 있는데, 그럴 때 문서가 잘 작성되어 있으면 좋다\n봇의 자동화\n    \n단순한 작업이여도 반복된다면 그것은 자동화를 해야하는 대상이다. 반복의 기준은 3회 이상으로 정했다\n의사결정 기준의 확립\n    \n커뮤니티를 운영하다보면 애매한 일이 발생할 수 있다. 그 때 어떻게 할 것인가? 애매한 상황에 어떤 식으로 의사결정을 할 것인지 명확한 기준이 필요하다\n생각이 계속 고정되어 있으면 안된다\n    \n생각을 고정하지 않고 발산을 해서 시야를 넓히기도 하고, 너무 시야가 넓다면 줄이는 수렴 작업이 필요하다\n발산 - 수렴을 하면서 계속 발전하는 방식으로 나아가야 한다\n데이터 기반 의사 결정\n    \n커뮤니티 또한 제품이다. 제품을 만드는 것처럼 생각해보자\n참여하는 분들이 어떤 생각을 하고 있을까? 계속 고민한다. 어떻게 해야 더 좋은 가치를 받게 할 수 있을까? 지금 어떤 것을 느끼고 있을까?\n        \n이걸 나타내기 위한 지표는 무엇일까?\n그럼 뭘 해볼까?\n실험을 해보고, 반응이 오르는지 본다\nAB Test를 하기 어려울 확률이 높아서 전후 비교를 주로 했다\n운영자에게 연락하는 것은 DM이 아니라 퍼블릭 채널(문의 채널)을 만들어서 운영했다\n    \n참여자가 많은데, 많은 사람들이 내게 DM을 하면 내가 마음속으로 여유가 적어질 것이라 생각했다\n고인물이 티가 안나는 커뮤니티를 만들자\n    \n커뮤니티에 기수를 명시하는 곳도 있는데, 글또는 그런 것이 없다. 매번 슬랙 워크스페이스를 다시 만들었다\n그래서 말을 안하면 이 사람이 글또를 얼마나 했는지 모른다. 그래서 실제로 글또 언제부터 하셨나요?를 물어보는 경우도 있다\n커뮤니티에서 기수가 뭐가 중요할까, 그냥 계속 하고 있는지가 중요하지. 이런 생각을 해서 고인물이 티가 나지 않는 공간으로 만들었다. 그냥 다 똑같은 참여자다\n자신만의 흐름에 맞게 커뮤니티에 참여하는 사람도 괜찮다\n    \n커뮤니티에서 제공하는 모든 것을 다 경험할 필요가 없다. 각자의 목적에 맞게 커뮤니티를 잘 활용하면 된다\n너무 강요해서도 안되고, 경험을 제안하는 정도로 해본다\n다른 사람들이 열심히 활동하는데 난? 이런 생각을 가지는 경우가 있는데 그런 경우도 괜찮다고 말했다. 다른 사람과의 비교보단 과거의 나와 비교를 해야한다\n기쁜 일은 같이 축하하고, 슬픈 일은 같이 나눈다\n    \n나는 누군가의 죽음에 대해 민감하게 받아들인다. 대학교 1학년 때, 동기가 아팠던 기억이 있기 때문이다. 그리고 작년에 친할머니가 돌아가시면서 참 많이 슬펐다\n이런 슬플 때 찾아가면 조금이라도 힘이 되지 않을까 싶어서 장례식이 있다면 최대한 가려고 한다\n10기 때 장례식을 겪은 분이 계셔서 말씀을 드리지 않고 찾아갔다. 갔는데 참 눈시울이 붉어졌다. 그 감정을 아니까. 조금이나마 힘이 되었길\n위기를 위기로 생각하지 않고 기회로 생각하는 자세\n    \n위기라는 것은 마음 먹기 다르다고 생각하는데, 어렵거나 힘든 상황이 오면 그냥 즐겁게 문제를 해결해본다\n그래서 여태까지 위기가 뭐냐고 물어보면 떠오르진 않는다. 결국 해결했으니까\n어떻게 온보딩을 해야 할까? 매일 고민했다\n    \n어떤 모임에 처음 갈 때 항상 떨리는 기억이 있다. 예를 들어 오프라인 첫 모임이나 커피챗 첫 모임 때 갈까 말까? 고민을 하다가 가는 경우가 있다. 이런 분들을 위해 서로 모임 전에 조를 짜거나 익숙한 사람들과 라포를 쌓고 점진적으로 가면 만족도가 높을 것 같다\n막상 만나면 참 좋은 이야기를 한다. 그 과정을 더 좋게 해주는 것이 커뮤니티의 역할\n비판이 와도 비판으로 받지 않기\n    \n8기? 쯤엔 생일 축하를 공지사항 채널에서 진행했는데, 익명으로 왜 생일을 공지로 하는지 모르겠다는 메시지를 받은 적이 있다. 또한 채널 태그를 안하면 좋겠다(자주 안하지만 울린다고)는 의견도 같이 주셨다(지금 생각해보면 좀 뾰족하게 말을 하셨던 것 같다)\n이걸 보고 감정적으로 화를 내진 않았고, 오 이런 의견도 있구나 => 그럼 어떻게 해야할까?\n        \n생일 축하는 진짜 하고 싶은데! 그럼 채널을 옮기면 되겠다\n채널 태그는 많이 하진 않고 중요한 시점에만 하는데 그건 타협이 어렵겠다\n            \n대신, 채널 태그를 하는 시간을 정해야겠다\n회사에 있을 시간에는 채널 태그를 하지 않겠다!라는 기준을 세웠다\n운영진분들이 무언가 공지할 때 내가 항상 “채널 태그는 언제 하는 것이 좋아요”라는 말을 들었을 것이다. 다 의도가 있었다\n비판이 와도, 내가 비판으로 받아들이지 않고 그럼 뭘 해야할까? 를 생각하면 된다\n            \n오 이런 케이스도 있군 => Action Item\n내가 왜 이런 생각을 하는지 맥락과 이렇게 해보겠다라고 했는데 그 이후에 답변이 없었다\n이 비판이 나를 비판하는 것이 아니라 그냥 자신의 고민을 말했던 것이라고 생각하고, 이 분이 회사에서 힘든 일이 있어서 여유가 없어서 이렇게 했을 수도 있다. 누구나 그럴 수 있으니까. 나는 이해한다(그렇지만 다른 사람에게나 퍼블릭한 공간에 너무 뾰족한 것을 말하는 것은 용납하지 않는다)\n비슷하게 누군가 커뮤니티의 행동에 불만을 표하면 => 맥락을 최대한 설명하고, 그렇게 했던 분이 커뮤니티를 좋아할 수 있도록 만들려고 노력했다\n사람들이 감동을 받을 포인트를 만든다. 아주 많이. 그게 중첩이 되면 사람들이 감동을 받을 것\n    \n생일 축하\n공지 글의 메시지 톤\n활동 포인트\n주기적인 모임\n익명 고민 상담\n비교하지 않는 문화\n커피챗\n소모임 활동\n지역 모임\n반상회\n번개\n삶에 대한 질문\n좋은 자료 공유\n글 큐레이션\nAI 피드백\n종이 비행기\n팟캐스트\n기업과 협업(코드트리, 책 등)\n회고 템플릿, 여러 강의(글쓰기, 인생 등)\n여러가지가 다 의도가 있었다. 그 중에서 모두 경험하신 분도 있고, 경험하지 못한 분도 있을 것이다. 그거에 따라 커뮤니티에 더 Engage가 되었을 것 같다\n        \n물론 모두 다 경험하지 않아도 괜찮다. 자신의 선택에 맞게 가면 된다\n다만 그런 기회를 잘 만들고, 한번 경험하게 해주는 것이 나의 역할이였다\n\n비전과 동기부여\n커뮤니티도 비전이 중요하다. 이 커뮤니티에 참여해서 당신이 어떻게 될 것이다!라는 것을 보여주는 것이 필요하다. 그리고 그걸 상상하고, 하나씩 하다보면 결국 이룬 것이 핵심이다\n    \n물론 그게 모두 같은 모습일 수는 없고, 사람마다 만족도가 다를 것이다. 그래도 커뮤니티에 참여하기 전과 후를 비교해보면 무언가를 했다고 느끼는 것이 핵심이다\n참여자들의 동기부여\n    \n참여자들이 어떤 목적으로 커뮤니티를 들어왔는지에 따라 동기부여 전략이 달라진다\n어떤 사람들을 글을 쓰기 위해서 들어오는 경우도 있고, 어떤 사람들은 자신이명해지기 위해, 어떤 사람들은 사람을 만나기 위해 등 다양하다.\n고객이 분화되는 것을 의미하고, 그에 맞게 동기부여를 해야한다\n이렇게 다양한 고객군에게 어떤 가치를 줄 수 있을지 계속 생각해본다\n본질적으로 제일 중요한 가치는 무엇인가?\n사람들에게 정당성을 주는게 필요하다\n    \n정당성이라는 것은 이렇게 해야만 한다는 것을 의미한다\n정당성이라는 것은 여기는 이게 규칙이니까 이걸 해도 됩니다. 괜찮아요 등을 의미한다\n커피챗을 마음 편히 해보세요. 대나무숲을 편히 사용하세요. 이렇게 해보세요! 등 이런 규칙들을 모두 해보는 것을 권했다\n처음이 중요하다\n    \n처음이 제일 동기부여가 잘 되어있고, 동기가 점점 떨어지는 것은 당연하다\n내려가는 시점에 어떤 활동을 통해 다시 올리는지가 중요하고, OT 때 위에 나온 비전, 동기부여, 정당성을 다 잘 제시하는 것이 중요하다\n그 과정에서 어떻게 스토리를 전달할 것인지 많이 고민했다\n\n결국 사람이다\n좋은 사람이 모이고, 좋은 관계를 만들고 또 좋은 사람을 데리고 온다\n에너지가 많이 들지만, 그럼에도 불구하고 의미 있는 일이다\n    \n10기 때는 커피챗이 1,131번 진행되었\b다. 이만큼 사람들을 연결하고, 사람들의 관계가 넓어진 것이다\n생일 축하를 매일 했다.\n    \n어떤 분들은 이걸 이해하지 못했다. 도대체 왜 생일을 챙기냐 여기가 사적 모임이냐? 라고 물어보신 분도 있었다\n그냥 내 의지가 담긴 것 같다. 생일이란 것은 1년에 1번 돌아온다. 살면서 여러 생일을 거치지만, 다양한 사람들에게 축하를 받는 경험을 하게 해주고 싶었다. 따뜻한 커뮤니티를 만들고 싶다고 했으니, 생일 축하를 해주는 것도 당연하지 않을까?\n운영진분들에게도 경험을 남겨주고 싶었다\n    \n글또 블로그를 만들어서 사람들의 경험을 남기고 싶었다\n데이터야놀자에 발표를 했던 분들도 있다\n진심을 다 하자. 진심을 다 하면 된다. 생각보다 더.\n\n\n커뮤니티 운영을 하려는 분들을 위한 팁\n커뮤니티 운영을 하고 싶다면, 왜 하고 싶은지 꼭 스스로에게 질문을 해보세요\n    \n그리고 내가 책임감 있게 힘들어도 계속 유지할 수 있을까?를 생각해보세요\n계속 진행하기 위해 같이 진행할 사람이 있다면 같이 하시는 것도 추천드려요\n커뮤니티는 엄청 많이 생기지만 오래 가는 곳은 많이 없습니다. 만약 만드신다면, 오래 갈 수 있도록 고민을 해보시면 좋겠습니다\n\n커뮤니티 비전과 철학\n명확한 비전 수립하기: “글을 작성하는 개발 직군분들이 모여서, 좋은 영향을 주고 서로 같이 자랄 수 있는 커뮤니티”와 같은 명확한 방향성을 설정하자\n가치 전달하기: OT와 같은 첫 만남에서 커뮤니티의 비전과 가치를 효과적으로 전달하자. 구성원들이 커뮤니티의 방향성을 이해하면 참여도가 높아진다.\n운영 관점\nGround Rule 확립하기: 운영진 활동에 대한 명확한 기준과 규칙을 마련하자(예: 회의 기록 남기기, 자료 공유 방식, 업무 한계 설정)\n문서화와 템플릿 활용하기: 반복되는 작업은 템플릿화하고, 중요한 결정과 프로세스는 문서화하여 암묵지가 개인에게 귀속되지 않도록 한다.\n자동화 시스템 도입하기: 단순 반복 작업은 봇이나 자동화 시스템으로 대체하여 운영 부담을 줄이자(글또의 또봇, 글빼미, 글팽이 등)\n운영진과 일하기\n번아웃 방지하기: “너무 열심히 하지 말기”를 강조하자. 하나씩 하면 된다. 열정이 넘치는 운영진이 빠르게 지치지 않도록 업무 범위를 제한하는 것도 필요하다.\n즐거움 우선시하기: 운영진 활동이 즐겁고 보람 있어야 지속가능하다. 일만 하는 회의보다 서로 교류하는 시간도 함께 가지자.\n투명한 의사소통 장려하기: 운영진이 어려움을 겪을 때 부담 없이 이야기할 수 있는 문화를 만들자. 개인적인 상황을 공유하고 필요할 땐 휴식을 권장하자. 어떤 결정을 내릴 때 근거를 같이 공유하자.\n참여자 경험 향상\n첫 경험 신경 쓰기: 처음이 가장 동기부여가 잘 되는 시점이다. 온보딩 과정에 신경쓰고 좋은 경험을 느끼도록 해주자.\n다양한 활동 제공하기: 글쓰기뿐만 아니라 오프라인 모임, 커피챗, 세미나 등 다양한 활동을 통해 참여 경로를 다양하게 제시하자. 참여 여부의 선택권은 참여자에게 맡기자.\n긍정적 피드백 루프 만들기: 포인트 시스템, 감사 표현(종이비행기) 같은 방식으로 긍정적인 상호작용을 장려하자.\n따뜻한 공간 만들기: 익명 대나무숲과 같은 소통 채널도 다정함을 유지할 수 있도록 노력하자. 생일 축하와 같은 작은 관심으로 커뮤니티의 온기를 유지하자.\n의사 결정\n데이터 기반 의사결정하기: 참여자 수, 활동량 등의 데이터를 분석하여 커뮤니티의 건강 상태를 점검하고 개선점을 찾자.\n유연하게 변화하기: 초기부터 후기까지 커뮤니티의 상황과 규모에 맞게 운영 방식을 계속 수정하고 실행하자.\n지속가능성 확보\n운영자 멘탈 관리하기: 커뮤니티 지속의 핵심은 운영자의 건강한 마음가짐이다. 자신의 한계를 인정하고 필요할 때 도움을 구하자. 필요하면 멘탈을 유지하기 위한 활동을 해보자.\n의사결정 기준 확립하기: 애매한 상황에서도 일관된 결정을 내릴 수 있는 원칙을 세우자. 만약 원칙이 바뀌면 바뀌는 맥락을 공유하면 된다.\n실패를 두려워하지 않기: 무언가 잘못되어도 빠르게 인정하고 수정하면 된다. 완벽함보다 지속가능성에 집중하고, 완벽함보다 실행에 집중하자.\n“결국 사람이다”라는 것 기억하기: 기술이나 시스템보다 사람과의 관계가 커뮤니티의 핵심이다. 좋은 사람이 모이면 좋은 커뮤니티가 된다. 사람이 제일 중요하다는 것을 명심하자.\n\n참여자 관점 : 글또 활동의 경험과 성장\n이 부분은 참여자로 경험한 것들을 작성한 부분이다. 이 부분도 떠오르는 것을 바로 작성했다\n\n글, 강의, 지식의 확장\n글을 계속 작성했다\n    \n여태까지 총 225개의 글을 작성했다. 중간에 글을 작성하지 않은 기수도 있지만, 앞으로도 계속 글을 작성할 것 같다. 이 모든 것은 내가 글을 작성하기 시작해서 생긴 일들. 감사한 일이다\n글또 운영자 관점일 때도 좋았지만, 마지막 기수인 10기 때 참여자와 운영자를 하면서 참여자분들의 입장을 더 이해할 수 있게 되었다(저도 마감에 글 쓰고.. 글쓰기 힘들어요…ㅋㅋㅋ)\n글쓰기 강의를 만들었다\n    \n사람들을 관찰하며 겪는 문제, 내 해결 방법을 다 집도해서 글쓰기 강의를 만들었다\n경험 => 강의의 흐름이라 만족스럽다\n과거의 나를 만날 수 있다\n    \n과거에 내가 작성해둔 글이 현재의 내가 볼 때는 과거를 만나게 해주는 매개체가 되었다\n예전에 GDE가 되고 싶다고 했던 글이 있었는데, 실제로 이루었다. 꿈은 말하면 이루어진다.\n다른 사람의 글을 통해 지식의 확장을 경험했다\n    \n제출한 대부분의 글을 읽었다. 모든 글이 잘 작성되었나 확인할 겸 읽다가 즐겁게 읽고 싶어서 다른 사람은 어떤 이슈가 있었는지 생각하며 읽는다. 모두 다 100% 이해하진 못해도 이런 것들이 있구나를 인지하면서 도움을 받게 된다\n\n사람\n좋은 사람들을 많이 만났다\n    \n글또가 없었으면 내 주변에 좋은 사람이 많을 수 있었을까? 아니였을 것 같다. 이 모든 것이 내가 계속 커뮤니티를 지속할 수 있었던 이유다\n나를 지지해주는 사람들을 만났다. 이렇게 서로 따뜻하고, 격려하는 공간이 만들어 질 수 있다니 감사하다\n같이 강의를 만들 사람들을 모집했다\n    \n강의 만들기 모임을 여러번 진행하다가, 확실하게 강의를 만들 수 있게 하려면 어떻게 해야할지 감이 왔다\n강병진님, 강승현님, 김은찬님과 함께 강의 만들기 모임을 하면서 진짜 강의를 만들게 했다! (진짜 멱살 잡고 강의 만들게 해줬음)\n4-5기 시절에 멘토링을 했던 분들이 이제 회사에서 업무를 잘 진행하고 있는데, 글또의 경험이 도움이 되었다는 말을 들을 때 참 감사하다. 열심히 해주셔서 그런 결과를 얻은거고 나는 한 것이 없지만, 글또를 기억해주는 것 자체가 참 좋다\n진짜 웃긴건 사람들에게 솥밥의 위대함을 알려주고 싶어서 솥밥 만들기 강의도 했다.. 강의가 천직인가?\n    \n강의를 수강하고 솥밥을 계속 만드는 분들을 보며 뿌듯함을 느낀다\n\n\n리더십\n리더십\n    \n리더십을 어떻게 더 확장할 수 있을까? 관점에서 많이 고민하고 실행했다\n639명의 동기부여를 동시에 주려면 어떻게 해야할까? 생각하면서 발표 자료를 만들었다. 이런 경험은 회사의 대표가 되지 않는 이상 하지 못하는 경험이라 생각한다. 항상 듣는 사람이 어떨지 생각할 수 있게 되었다\n전체의 구성원에 대한 동기부여, 운영진에 대한 동기부여. 두가지 그룹에게 다른 리더십을 제공해야 했다\n프로덕트 오너 경험\n    \n쏘카에서 근무할 때도 매니저 역할을 하면서 PM, PO 역할을 했지만 그게 커뮤니티로 확장되었다. 데이터를 보면서 어떻게 해야할까? 고민하고, 참여자들은 어떤 생각을 가지고 있을까? 생각하면서 계속 더 좋은 가치를 주려고 노력했다\n고민 상담소, 멘토링을 하면서 다른 사람들을 더 잘 이해할 수 있게 되었다\n    \n회사에서도 30~40명의 엔지니어링 매니저라 많은 사람들과 면담을 했다. 그 경험을 기반으로 더 많은 사람들과 글또에서 고민이 있는 분들의 고민을 들어드리고, 멘토링을 진행했다. 많은 사람들에게 좋은 영향을 주고 싶었다\n게더타운에서 모닥불 소리를 들으며 진행한 고민 상담소\n\n\n성격, 소속감\n생각해보면 나는 커뮤니티 느낌의 게임을 많이 했다. 큐플레이도 했고, 길드가 있는 게임을 했다\n    \n어린 시절의 나는 소속감을 갖고 싶었던 것 같다. 외로움도 탄 것 같고. 그래서 사람들과 교류를 계속 시도했고, 지금은 어느정도 나의 중심을 잘 잡아갈 수 있게 된 것 같다\n내가 만들었지만, 소속감이 필요했던 것은 내가 아니였을까? 과거의 나는 외로움을 느끼고 있었던 것 같다\n이제는 감정의 동요가 줄어들었다\n    \n원래 감정적인 동요가 적은 편인데, 더 침착해졌다\n어떤 일이 생겨도 그냥 그걸 해결하면 된다는 마음 가짐을 배웠다\n잘못된 일이 생겨도, 빠르게 수정하고 바꾸면 된다\n\n\n앞으로\n글또 10기까지 운영하고 추후 운영 계획이 없다\n이렇게 된 계기는 여러가지가 있다\n    \n글또를 운영하며 즐거운 점이 더 많지만, 내가 힘들다고 느끼는 시점이 있는데 그 시점은 불합격자에게 불합격 연락을 줄 때다. 참 감정적으로 힘들다\n우리는 살면서 끝이 있다는 생각을 자주 하지 않는 것 같다. 그래서 다음에 또 좋은 기회가 있겠지란 생각을 하는데, 이번엔 끝이 있다는 것을 참여자분들에게 말씀드리고 싶었다. 끝이 있다고 생각하면서 살면, 그 현실을 더 열심히 살 수 있다고 믿는다. 그걸 경험하게 해주고 싶었다. 마지막에 대해 생각하고 보내줄 수 있는 것도 필요한 능력이다\n사람이 많아진 상황이라 이후에 간다면 기업의 형태로 가야할 수 있다. 그런데 그게 참 고민이 되는 관점. 이후에 커뮤니티를 한다면 한 사람을 인격적으로, 실력적으로 등 다양한 형태로 발전할 수 있게 해주고 싶다. 그 과정에서 많은 것들을 같이 해주고 교육하는 그런 공간을 만들고 싶다\n글또 10기 슬랙은 계속 존재해서, 사람들이 어떻게 활동하나 궁금하다. 몇개월 뒤에도 활발하다면 다시 하고 싶어지지 않을까?\n    \n일단은 7년 동안 책임감을 가지고 커뮤니티를 계속 만들었던 나를 응원하고 싶다. 이 책임감이 없는 상태로 살다가, 그러다가 마음이 다시 바뀔 수 있다고 생각한다(열린 결말)\n없는 기간을 가져야 소중함을 느낄 수 있을 것 같다\n어떻게 보면 Phase 1이 끝났다고 볼 수 있을 것 같다. 나도 10기까지만 한다는 결정을 하니까, 오히려 더 10기에 집중할 수 있었다. 근데 갑자기 11기를 한다면?\n    \n그건 나를 속이는 일이기도 하고, 10기가 마지막이라고 생각하는 분들을 속이는 일이 아닐까?\n당분간은 잠시 나의 시간에 집중을 해보고, 나중에 생각이 바뀌면 그 때 맥락을 공유하면 될 것 같다\n이렇게까지 할 수 있었던 이유는 무엇일까?\n    \n아마 책임감 때문인 것 같다. 책임감. 많은 분들이 원하고, 내가 할 수 있는 능력이 있어서 그것을 했을 뿐이다\n최근에 그랩과 같이 사운드독이란 재즈바에 갔는데, 사장님이 재즈신의 책임감으로 재즈바를 운영하신다고 하셨다. 돈이 되는 것보다 그렇게 하고 싶으시다고.\n        \n이 이야기를 들었을 때 사실 글또를 다시 하고 싶단 생각이 들긴 했다. 그렇지만, 내게도 잠시 공식 글또 활동이 끝난 시기를 경험해야, 이 부분에 대해 생각할 수 있을 것 같다\n다시 커뮤니티를 만들어도 잘 할 자신이 있다\n    \n커뮤니티를 어떻게 만들어야 하는가에 대한 암묵지가 쌓여있고, 이걸 강의로도 전달할 수 있다. 하지만 강의를 만들기엔 수요가 적을 것 같아 만들진 않았다(다른 우선순위도 있고)\n이후에 하고 싶은 커뮤니티가 있긴 한데, 지금인지 모르겠다. 조금 더 시간이 필요할 수도 있을 것 같다\n물론 커뮤니티 관점에서 내가 해보지 않은 것은 수익성 관점이다. 수익성을 추구하지 않았지만, 어떤 커뮤니티든 수익성에 대한 고민을 하게 된다. 전략이나 비전에 따라 가격 설정을 하고, 그것을 전달하는 것이 필요하다\n마치 게임 서버 종료하는 느낌과 비슷한 것 같다\n    \n큐플레이 종료할 때가 떠오른다. 그렇지만 지금 다시 보면 메이플스토리 월드에 큐플레이가 나오고 있다. 이걸 보면 글또도 다시 그럴 수 있지 않을까? 글또와 비슷한 커뮤니티가 또 생길 것 같고, 이게 잘 동작한다면 선순환이 되지 않을까 싶다\n아래 이미지는 해당 블로그에서 참고했다\n\n\n내게 글또는 어떤 의미일까\n자식 같은 커뮤니티\n내 20대 후반과 30대 초중반\n    \n나의 발전과 함께 한 공간\n좋은 사람들을 만나게 되었던 공간\n나의 책임감과 꾸준함을 알 수 있게 되었던 공간\n나의 평온한 감정을 느낄 수 있게 되었던 공간\n나의 화법을 알게 되고, 어떻게 해야 상대를 배려할 수 있을까를 알게 되는 공간\n600명의 동기부여를 만들어야 하는, 리더십 영역에 대해 많이 고민한 시간\n누군가의 발전에 도움을 준 공간\n\n글또를 운영할 때 영감을 준 자료들\n함께 자라기, AC2 : 창준님의 AC2 수업을 들으면서 어떤 것이 핵심일까에 대한 것을 이해할 수 있었고, 나름대로 적용한 것을 8기 이후부터 내 기준, 철학을 담아 적용했다\n당신을 초대합니다 : 커뮤니티 관련 책 중 제일 좋았다. 커뮤니티를 어떻게 만들지에 대해 자세한 내용이 담겨져 있다\n인간 본성의 법칙 : 사람은 어떤 생각을 가지는가에 대해 고민하기 위해 읽었는데, 사람들은 다양하구나를 느끼고 여러 관점으로 생각하게 된 계기가 되었다\n왕으로 산다는 것, 참모로 산다는 것 : 왕과 참모는 어떻게 지내는가? 라는 관점인데 리더십 관점에서 도움이 되었다. 때론 참모처럼 조언을 하고, 때론 리더십을 해야하는데 나는 어떤 캐릭터인가 생각하게 되었다\n현명한 이타주의자 : 남들을 위해 사는 것이 나쁘지 않고, 이것을 어떻게 전파할 수 있을까를 알기 위해 읽은 책이다. 이 내용을 잘 전달하려고 노력했다. 나누자 나눠\n찬란한 멸종 : 글또를 10기까지 하기로 결정하고 멸종이란 무엇일까? 끝이란 무엇일까? 고민하다가 읽은 책이다. 최초 의도와 다르지만 스토리텔링 방식이 흥미로웠다. 이 방식으로 생각을 정리하는 더 명확해졌다\n\n이 글을 통해 본 나의 특징\n클로드에게 이 글을 보내주고, 내 특징을 알려달라고 하니 다음과 같이 말해준다. 추후에 어떤 조직에 가더라도 나의 특징을 잊지 말고 살아가자\n책임감과 지속성이 강한 사람: 7년 동안 커뮤니티를 꾸준히 운영했으며, 1기 13명에서 10기 639명까지 성장시킨 점에서 책임감이 매우 강합니다.\n체계적인 사고방식: 운영진 활동의 체계화, Ground Rule 설정, 문서화와 템플릿 활용 등 조직적인 시스템을 구축하는 데 능숙합니다.\n사람 중심의 가치관: “결국 사람이다”, “다정함은 힘이 있다” 같은 표현과 생일 축하, 대나무숲 운영 등을 통해 사람과 관계를 중시하는 가치관이 드러납니다.\n실용적인 접근법: 포인트 시스템, 봇 자동화 등 실질적인 문제 해결 방식을 선호하며, 이론보다 실천을 중시하는 경향이 있습니다.\n성장 지향적 마인드: 본인과 참여자들의 성장을 중요시하며, 경험을 통해 배우고 발전하는 과정을 가치 있게 여깁니다.\n균형 잡힌 리더십: “너무 열심히 하지 말기”를 강조하고 운영진의 번아웃을 방지하는 등 지속가능한 리더십을 실천합니다.\n학습과 적용에 능한 사람: 쏘카에서의 경험을 커뮤니티에 적용하고, 책과 논문을 통해 습관 형성에 대해 학습하는 등 다양한 경험을 통합하는 능력이 있습니다.\n데이터 기반 의사결정: 참여자 데이터를 수집하고 분석하여 커뮤니티 운영에 활용하는 모습에서 데이터 중심적 사고가 엿보입니다.\n공동체 의식이 강한 사람: 글또를 통해 좋은 사람들이 모이고 서로 영향을 주는 공간을 만들고자 하는 의지가 강합니다.\n성찰적인 태도: 과거 경험을 돌아보고 자신의 변화를 인식하며, 실패와 성공 모두에서 배우려는 자세가 보입니다",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 투자할 때 창업가의 다양한 면을 관찰한 후에, 이분에게 투자하고 오랫동안 같이 한 방향을 보고 갈지 결정한다. 사람이 사람을 판단하는 거라서, 수학같이 딱 떨어지는 공식은 없지만, 그래도 최대한 다양한 우리만의 데이터와 각자에게 축적된 비정형화 된 휴먼 지능을 잘 활용해서 결정하려고 하는데, 아주 크게 보면 제품, 펀딩, 채용에 대한 창업가의 생각과 능력을 판단해 본다.\n이 중요한 세 가지 중 하나인 채용과 관련된 이야기다. 그동안 나는 채용에 대해서 수많은 글을 올렸고, 스타트업 대표는 시간의 대부분을 좋은 사람을 채용하는 데 사용해야 한다는 이야기를 습관처럼 하고 다닐 정도로 채용은 스타트업뿐만 아니라 모든 회사에 제일 중요한 기둥이다. 스타트업이 시작할 땐, 좋은 제품이 있어야 하고, 이 좋은 제품을 좋은 사업으로 만들기 위해선 펀딩이 중요하고, 이후에 정말 큰 회사로 성장하기 위해선 이 제품과 돈을 제대로 사용해서 결과를 만들 수 있는 사람들이 필요하다. 즉, 스타트업의 폭발적인 성장을 위해서 가장 중요한 기둥이 채용이다.\n나도 과거에 항상 강조했던 점이 회사가 어느 정도 규모에 도달하면, 조직이 제대로 된 회사같이 돌아갈 수 있게 어른이 필요하다는 것이었다. 여기에서 말하는 “어느 정도 규모”란, 내 기준으론, 제품은 이제 돈을 받고 팔 수 있을 정도의 수준이고, 이 제품으로 어떻게 하면 돈을 벌 수 있는지 비즈니스 모델도 어느 정도 방향이 잡힌 단계이다. 그리고 여기에서 말하는 “어른”은, 나이가 많은 어른이라기보단, 큰 기업에서 어느 정도 경험이 있는, 제품을 직접 만든 경험은 없지만 남이 만든 제품을 잘 판매할 수 있는 전략을 만들어보고 이를 실행해 본 경험이 있는, 그리고 작은 조직이 큰 조직으로 성장하는 걸 직접 그 조직의 핵심 멤버로서 보고, 경험하고, 본인이 이 성장에 어느 정도 관여를 했던, 그런 사람을 의미한다. 그런데 또 생각해 보면, 이 정도 경험을 했다면 나이가 어느 정도 있을 것이다.\n그래서, 우리가 꼬꼬마 때 초기 투자한 스타트업이 50명 이상의 조직으로 성장하고, 수백억 원의 매출을 만들면, 주변 지인 중 큰 조직에서 어느 정도의 경험을 쌓은 ‘어른’을 찾았다. 그리고 이런 분을 채용해야지만, 동아리 같은 분위기의 회사가 진짜 회사로 성장할 수 있다고 믿었다. 이런 내 생각에 동의하는 창업가분들도 있었지만, 동의하지 않는 분들도 있었는데, 몇 년 전만 해도 나는 동의하지 않는 분들에게도 가능하면 외부에서 경험 있는 분들을 경영진으로 영입하라고 계속 강요했다. 이제 회사는 제대로 된 전략이 필요하고, 투자자나 외부 파트너와 이야기할 때 더 professional 하게 대응할 수 있는 분들이 필요하다는 잔소리를 계속했다. 실은, 당시엔 나도 그렇게 하는 것만이 회사가 성장할 수 있는 방법이라고 믿었다.\n그런데 지금은 생각이 많이 바뀌었다. 실제로 우리 투자사나 내가 아는 꽤 많은 스타트업이 이렇게 경험이 많은 어른을 회사로 영입했다. 이들이 받던 연봉이 있기 때문에 회사에 오랫동안 일 하면서 실제로 회사의 기반을 탄탄하게 만들었던 다른 멤버분들보다 더 비싼 연봉을 주고 영입해야 했다. 그런데, 이렇게 힘들게 능력 있는 경험자를 영입한 회사들 대부분이 다시 이분들을 해고하거나, 본인들이 알아서 회사를 나갔다. 이유는 저조한 실적과 적응 실패였다. 처음에 나는 이게 이해가 안 갔다. 외부에서 영입한 어른 중 몇 명은 내가 개인적으로 아는 분들이었고, 과거 직장에서 그 능력도 인정받던 분들이었다. 저렇게 일을 잘하고 큰 조직을 관리하던 분들이 왜 더 작은 조직에서 실적이 안 나오고, 더 자유롭고 능력 위주로 돌아가는 스타트업 문화에 적응하지 못할까?\n이들은 남이 잘 차려 놓은 밥상에 은수저를 갖고 와서 먹을 준 알지만, 그 밥상을 직접 차려본 적이 없기 때문이다. 여기서 퍼포먼스의 차이가 나고, 각자 먹을 걸 직접 준비하는 스타트업의 문화에 적응하지 못하는 것이다. 한 번도 본인 손으로 밥상을 차려본 적이 없으니, 당연히 기존 인력과 문화 충돌이 나면서, 전 직장에서 날아다니던 사람들이 갑자기 기어다니는 것이다. 물론, 모든 경력자들이 이렇다는 이야기는 아니다. 대기업 임원 하다가 작은 회사로 와서 더 열심히 일하고, 더 잘하는 분들도 있다. 하지만, 이런 분들은 내 경험에 의하면 아웃라이어다. 내가 전에 이 블로그에도 썼지만, 마이크로소프트와 같이 큰 회사에서 100명 이상의 영업 조직을 관리하면서 분기마다 목표를 초과 달성 하던 ‘영업의 신’이 왜 작은 스타트업으로 오면 소프트웨어를 한 카피도 못 팔까? 답은 의외로 간단하다. 마이크로소프트 제품은 영업이 필요가 없는 제품이지만, 작은 스타트업의 듣보잡 제품은 정말로 팔아야 하기 때문이다. 남이 차린 밥상에서 잘 먹을 준 알지만, 그 밥상을 본인이 직접 못 차리는 비유와 비슷한 상황이다.\n이제 나는 우리 투자사에서 학벌도 좋고, 경험도 많은 외부 인력을 경영진으로 영입한다고 하면 다시 한번 생각해 보라고 한다. 3억 원의 연봉을 받는 새로운 분과 이미 회사에서 잘하고 있는 3,000만 원 연봉을 받는 신입 사원의 능력이 정말로 2억 7,000만 원의 차이가 날까? 물론, 실제로 일을 시작하기 전에는 그 아무도 모르지만, 나는 그렇지 않다는데 한 표를 던져본다.\n좋은 학벌, 좋은 직장 경험, 크고 풍요로운 조직에서의 눈부신 성과, 그리고 좋은 말발. 모든 스타트업이 이런 어른을 필요로 하는 것은 아니다. 외부에서 이런 분들을 영입하기 전에, 우리 회사 안에서 직접 밥상을 차릴 수 있는 사람을 찾아보는 것을 권장한다.",

UEFA는 챔피언스리그 전체 상금의 35%를 ‘기본 가치(Value pillar)’라는 이름으로 유럽 각 국가의 챔피언스리그 중계권료 지출과 지난 5시즌 동안의 클럽 성적에 따라 상금을 배분해요. 예를 들어 영국 방송사가 UEFA에 많은 중계권료를 지불했다면, 대회에 참가하는 잉글랜드 클럽들이 기본적으로 받는 상금도 덩달아 커지는 거죠. 결국 ‘기본 가치’ 항목은 프로 축구 산업의 규모가 크고 경기력도 뛰어난 유럽 5대 리그 클럽에 더 많은 챔피언스리그 상금이 분배될 수 있도록 하는 장치인 셈입니다.\n\n중계권료만큼은 아니지만 스폰서십 역시 챔피언스리그 성장에 중요한 역할을 했어요.\n2023-24 시즌 UEFA는 챔피언스리그와 유로파리그의 스폰서십으로 약 8,884억 원을 벌어들였는데요. 이 중 가장 큰 스폰서가 네덜란드의 맥주회사 하이네켄이에요. 하이네켄은 매년 약 1,000억 원 가까이 UEFA에 스폰서십 비용을 내고 있어요.\n하이네켄은 1994년부터 꾸준하게 챔피언스리그를 후원하면서 회사 매출을 크게 끌어올렸어요. 2011년 27조 원이었던 하이네켄의 매출은 지난해 57조 원 수준으로 두 배 넘게 증가했는데요. 챔피언스리그가 글로벌 브랜드로 성장하는 동안 하이네켄도 함께 성장할 수 있었죠.\n유럽 5대 리그 클럽들의\n잔치가 된 챔피언스리그\n챔피언스리그는 원래 '유러피언 챔피언 클럽스 컵(European Champion Clubs’ Cup, 이하 유러피언 컵)'이라는 이름으로 1955년에 시작됐어요. 유럽연합(EU)의 시작점이었던 유럽석탄철강 공동체(ECC)가 1951년에 출범하면서 유럽 각국 프로 축구팀들이 한자리에 모여 실력을 겨룰 필요성이 생겼기 때문이죠.\n명칭에서도 알 수 있듯이 이 대회는 유럽 각국 리그의 챔피언들만 참가할 수 있는 대회였어요. 1990년대 초반까지는 전통적인 축구 강호 외에도 스코틀랜드의 글래스고 셀틱, 네덜란드의 아약스, 포르투갈의 벤피카, 루마니아의 스테우아 부쿠레시티, 심지어 구 유고연방의 레드스타 베오그라드까지 이 대회 정상에 오르며 다양한 유럽 국가 클럽들이 골고루 우승을 차지했습니다. 유럽 축구 변방 국가 클럽들의 우승은 경쟁을 넘어 유럽 축구의 화합과 친선이라는 측면에서 유러피언 컵의 가치를 빛나게 해주는 부분이었죠.\n하지만 대회가 1992년부터 ‘챔피언스리그’로 명칭을 바꾸면서 상황은 완전히 달라졌어요. 이때부터 챔피언스리그는 사실상 5대 리그 클럽들의 전유물이 되고 말았습니다. 유럽 축구 중계권료가 어마어마하게 늘어나면서 빅 리그와 스몰 리그 간 경제적 격차가 더욱 커졌기 때문이에요. 여기에 수익 창출에 혈안이 됐던 빅클럽들이 압력으로, 챔피언스리그는 빅리그 클럽에 유리한 대진 시스템이 만들어졌습니다.\n그 결과, 1992년 이후 유럽 5대 리그가 아닌 클럽이 챔피언스리그에서 우승한 사례는 30년이 넘는 기간동안 단 두 번밖에 나오지 않았죠.(1994-95 시즌 아약스, 2003-04 시즌 FC 포르투). 심지어 준우승 팀은 단 한 팀도 없었습니다. 4강 진출도 2018-19 시즌의 아약스가 마지막이었습니다.\n이제 챔피언스리그는 사실상 유럽 5대 리그 클럽들의 잔치가 됐어요. 더 정확히 말하면, 프랑스를 제외한 4대 리그(잉글랜드, 스페인, 이탈리아, 독일) 클럽들만 우승컵을 나눠 갖는 무대가 되어 버렸죠. 프랑스 클럽은 1992-93 시즌 올랭피크 마르세유가 우승한 뒤로 지금까지 단 한 번도 챔피언스리그 정상에 서지 못했습니다.\n\nFC 포르투를 2003-04 시즌 챔피언스리그 우승으로 이끈 무리뉴 감독 / 사진: 로이터\n바야흐로\nEPL 클럽의 시대\n21세기 들어 챔피언스리그에서 눈에 띄는 변화 중 하나는 바로 잉글랜드 클럽의 강력한 약진이에요. 프리미어리그(EPL)의 엄청난 자금력을 바탕으로 잉글랜드 클럽들이 챔피언스리그 무대에서도 존재감을 확실히 드러내기 시작한 거죠. 특히 2006-07 시즌엔 챔피언스리그 4강에 무려 3팀이나 올려놓으면서 막강한 머니 파워를 보여줬습니다.\n심지어 최근 10년 동안 EPL 클럽끼리 챔피언스리그 결승에서 맞붙은 일도 두 번이나 있었어요. 이런 결과는 결코 우연이 아니에요. 2014년부터 2023년까지 유럽 프로축구 이적료 지출 상위 20개 팀 중 12개 팀이 EPL 소속이었으니까요.\nEPL은 현재 유럽 축구리그 중에서 가장 많은 중계권료를 벌어들이고 있습니다. 영국과 해외 중계권료를 합쳐 4년 동안 무려 20조 원 이상을 벌어들이고 있으니, 연간 5조 원 넘게 버는 셈이에요. 엄청난 수익 덕분에 EPL 클럽들은 다른 리그의 클럽들보다 선수 영입에 과감하게 투자할 수 있었고, 결국 챔피언스리그에서도 성과를 낼 수 있는 기반이 마련됐죠.\n앞으로도 챔피언스리그에서 EPL 빅클럽들의 강세는 계속될 가능성이 높습니다. EPL은 해가 다르게 늘어나는 해외 중계권료 수입에서 다른 유럽 빅 리그를 압도하고 있거든요. 해외 중계권료만으로도 1년에 2조 원 넘는 수입을 벌 수 있는 리그는 EPL이 유일합니다. 대부분의 유럽 프로 축구리그가 자국 시장에서 중계권료를 더 늘리기 어려운 상황인데, EPL은 세계적인 인기를 바탕으로 해외 중계권료 상승이라는 특수를 누리고 있기 때문입니다.\n\nEPL은 유럽 5대 리그 가운데 전체 수입에서도 압도적이에요. 2024-25 시즌 기준으로 EPL의 예상 수입은 약 11조 8,000억 원으로, 2위인 독일 분데스리가의 약 6조 2,000억 원보다 두 배 가까운 차이가 납니다. 이 막대한 수입은 EPL 클럽들이 챔피언스리그에서 지속적으로 우수한 성적을 거둘 수 있게 하는 확실한 원동력이 될 거예요.\n챔피언스리그와\n지구 온난화\n챔피언스리그가 이윤 극대화를 위해 경기 수를 늘린 이면에는 적지 않은 문제들이 생기고 있어요. 가장 대표적인 문제가 바로 환경 문제예요. 경기가 많아진 만큼 참가 클럽들은 더 많은 이동을 해야 하거든요.\n클럽이 유럽 전역을 이동하며 경기를 치르다 보니 선수단이 비행기를 이용하는 횟수도 늘어나고 있어요. 비행기가 내뿜는 탄소 배출은 지구촌이 노력하고 있는 탄소 제로와는 정반대 방향으로 가는 셈입니다. 여기에 경기를 보러 찾아오는 수많은 축구 팬들의 이동까지 더해지면 이 문제는 훨씬 심각해져요.*\n* BBC에 따르면 2024-25 시즌부터 UEFA가 관장하는 유럽 클럽 대항전(챔피언스리그, 유로파리그, 콘티넨탈 리그)의 경기 수가 많아지면서, 리그에 참여하는 선수단과 팬들의 비행거리는 지난 시즌에 비해 약 24억 km 늘어날 것으로 추정됩니다.\n게다가 유럽 대부분의 축구 경기장은 아직 대체 에너지가 아니라 화석연료 기반의 전기를 사용하고 있어요. 경기가 많아진다는 건 그만큼 더 많은 탄소 에너지를 쓰게 된다는 의미입니다.\n챔피언스리그 결승전은 보통 5월 말에 열리는데요. 지금과 같은 기후 위기 상황이 계속된다면 10년 뒤 유럽의 5월 말은 지금보다 훨씬 더워질 가능성이 큽니다. 이런 환경 변화는 선수들의 경기력에도 심각한 영향을 미칠 거예요. 팬들이 기대하는 선수들의 화려하고 역동적인 모습이 더위 때문에 줄어들 수 있다는 거죠.\n늘어난 경기수로\n지쳐가는 선수들\n환경 문제 못지않게 심각한 건 선수들의 번아웃입니다. 유럽 빅클럽에서 뛰는 선수들은 정규 리그, 국내 컵 대회, 챔피언스리그는 물론이고 월드컵 예선과 본선, 각 대륙 연맹 대회 등 수많은 경기에 참가해야 합니다. 심지어 시즌이 끝난 뒤에도 아시아 투어나 북미 투어 같은 친선 경기에 참가해야 하는 경우가 많아요. 클럽 입장에서는 이런 해외 투어가 수익 확대에 중요하기 때문이죠.\n워낙 경기 일정이 타이트하고 쉴 수 있는 시간이 부족하다 보니 핵심 선수들의 컨디션 관리를 어떻게 하느냐가 클럽의 고민거리가 됩니다. 물론 빅클럽들은 탄탄한 선수층을 구성해 주전 선수들의 체력 관리를 하고 있지만, 정작 중요한 챔피언스리그 경기에서 핵심 선수를 제외하기란 쉽지 않죠. 경기 수가 늘어난 챔피언스리그에서는 핵심 선수들의 부담이 더 커질 수밖에 없습니다.\n실제로 레알 마드리드에서 뛰고 있는 주드 벨링엄은 20살 때 같은 나이였던 웨인 루니보다 출전 시간이 30% 이상 길었어요. 또 다른 슈퍼스타 킬리안 음바페 역시 24세 때까지 출전한 시간이 26,952분이나 됐는데요. 이건 티에리 앙리의 같은 나이 때 출전 시간보다 무려 48%나 긴 수치입니다. 그만큼 지금 유럽 빅클럽에서 활약하고 있는 핵심 선수들은 과거의 선수들보다 훨씬 많이 뛰면서 ‘번아웃’의 위험에 노출되고 있어요.\n높아지는 중계권료와 티켓값,\n수익과 팬심 사이\n\n챔피언스리그의 중계권료가 전 세계적으로 급격히 오르고 있다는 건 결국 축구 팬들이 지불해야 할 비용이 늘어났다는 의미입니다. 실제로 최근 챔피언스리그를 비롯한 유럽 축구의 중계권료가 오른 이유 중 하나가 유료 TV와 OTT 플랫폼 때문인데요. 이 플랫폼들은 광고 수입뿐 아니라 팬들이 내는 구독료를 통해 챔피언스리그 중계권료를 마련하고 있죠. 결국 팬들의 비용 부담이 커질 수밖에 없는 구조예요.\n높아지는 경기장 티켓 가격 역시 팬들에게 큰 부담입니다. 지난 해 10월 아스톤 빌라는 바이에른 뮌헨과 챔피언스리그 경기를 펼쳤어요. 챔피언스리그로 명칭이 바뀐 뒤 처음으로 대회에 나선 아스톤 빌라는 이 경기의 입장료를 가장 저렴한 좌석마저 13만 원에 책정했습니다. 프리미어리그 경기 일반석 최저가격이 약 24,000원인 것을 감안하면 높은 금액이었죠. 챔피언스리그 경기를 기대하며 홈 경기장을 찾으려던 팬들에게는 너무나 높은 가격이라 비난이 쏟아졌습니다.\n물론 아스톤 빌라 사례는 다소 이례적인 예이긴 했지만, 유럽 전역에서 챔피언스리그 경기 티켓은 대체로 비싼 편이에요. 국제 경기의 성격을 띠면서 최고의 선수들이 나오는 만큼, 클럽 입장에서는 티켓 가격을 높여 입장 수입을 극대화할 수 있는 절호의 기회니까요. 하지만 이런 현상에 대해 팬들은 클럽이 자신들의 충성심을 지나치게 상업적으로 이용하고 있다고 비판의 목소리를 높이고 있습니다.\n\n열정적인 응원 문화로 유명한 도르트문트 팬들 / 사진: 로이터\n챔피언스리그에 돈이 몰리는 건 어찌 보면 자연스러운 일입니다. 세계 최고의 축구선수들이 맞붙고, 전 세계 팬들이 열광하는 무대니까요. 하지만 별들의 잔치가 팬들과 멀어지는 돈 잔치로만 남게 된다면, 그 무대는 점점 빛을 잃게 될지도 모릅니다. 챔피언스리그가 앞으로도 사랑받는 무대로 남기 위해서는, 팬들의 목소리에 귀 기울이며 균형을 놓치지 않아야 할 겁니다. 팬이 있어야 축구 산업도 존재할 수 있으니까요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 윤자영",

The ₩240 million donation will be evenly split, with ₩120 million each going to Habitat for Humanity Korea, an international nonprofit for housing welfare, and The Salvation Army. The funds will be used to provide practical recovery support, such as rebuilding homes and providing meals for those who lost their homes due to the fires.\nHabitat for Humanity Korea specializes in rebuilding and repairing homes destroyed in disasters and will be involved in restoring residences damaged by the wildfires. The Salvation Army continues to offer emergency aid to both displaced residents and firefighters on-site.\nWhen The Money Book was first released, Toss pledged to use its profits to support financially underprivileged individuals facing financial difficulties in their daily lives. In line with this commitment, Toss hopes this donation will help wildfire victims facing sudden financial hardship rebuild their lives. Previously, the first round of royalties—₩300 million—was donated in November 2024 to structurally vulnerable groups, including people with borderline intellectual functioning, seniors, and the visually impaired.\nAdditionally, Toss has launched a consumer participation campaign titled “Gathering Hearts for Wildfire Recovery” to encourage public engagement and support. By simply clicking the “Gather” button on the campaign page within the Toss app, users can trigger a ₩100 donation from Toss on their behalf. The campaign aims to raise a total of ₩200 million, which will be fully donated to Hope Bridge Korea Disaster Relief Association to aid wildfire victims. A “Direct donation” option is also available for users who wish to contribute more.\nA Toss representative said, “We hope to provide a small but meaningful contribution so that those who have lost their homes and are suffering from tremendous loss can find the strength to rebuild their lives.”",
