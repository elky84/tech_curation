        "content:encodedSnippet": "C++ development often involves nuances beyond the file you’re developing in. This can leave developers with many mental tabs open, balancing all the relevant context for their project to develop their C++ code properly.\nCopilot Chat in Visual Studio can already utilize context provided by specified files and invoked agents such as @workspace to generate suggestions. However, to improve the relevance of Copilot suggestions, we must provide tailored context to Copilot with considerations specific to the C++ language for developers to achieve better results. That way, developers can focus less on providing all the information necessary for their questions and focus more on the task at hand.\nVisual Studio can now provide Copilot Chat with various levels of C++ project context. These updates are designed to help C++ developers incorporate more relevant suggestions into their code, faster than ever.\nTo showcase Copilot’s increased awareness of C++, we will walk through 3 sample C++ workflows where Chat can provide assistance:\nImproving documentation for build instructions\nGenerating new tests\nModernizing C++ code\nUpgrade to the latest version of Visual Studio 2022 and try out GitHub Copilot (now with plans available for free) to access these updates for C++.\nDocumenting Build Instructions\nC++ projects can sometimes require developers to undergo several steps to be able to configure a project for development before they are even able to begin coding. Due to these requirements, it is important to document relevant instructions for onboarding developers thoroughly.\nWe asked Copilot Chat to improve documentation in the open-source project Endless Sky’s README. Copilot was able to include relevant context, such as dependencies like Ninja, to enhance Chat suggestions for improving documentation specific to this project’s needs, minimizing manual toil to onboard developers onto a project.\n\nGenerating Additional Tests\nWriting unit tests for C++ can be cumbersome and painstaking. With the /tests command, Copilot can assist with generating unit tests for the selected code. Copilot now has awareness of the available testing structure found in your project, so that when you invoke /tests to generate tests in your projects, friction is minimal for integrating the generated tests that fit in with your existing ones.\nFor example, when we prompted to generate new unit tests for the Step method in the Weather.cpp file in endless-sky using the /tests command, Copilot generated new tests that resemble the existing tests in the project:\n\nWhen compared to existing test code, like test_ship.cpp, the Chat response includes the same relevant header files and test case structure like using SCENARIO and GIVEN for test cases.\n\nRefactoring C++ code for modernization\nMaintainability of C++ code can be difficult as C++ coding conventions evolve over the years. C++ developers often need to refactor legacy code to improve code clarity and maintainability over time.\nNow, when asking Copilot questions related to C++ development such as refactoring code,  Copilot has the awareness to not only provide suggestions that are relevant to your selected code, but also suggestions that are compliant with your project’s configurations and standards.\nLet’s take a look at an example, using some loop code that finds the greatest even element in a given container below. It can be useful to update C++ raw loop code to utilize algorithms instead for a myriad of reasons, including improving code readability and minimizing errors\n\nWhen initially asked to refactor the code to incorporate algorithms or ranges using older C++/CMake versions, Copilot suggests using std::max_element to improve the code to be more concise instead of requiring a manual loop.\n\nAfter updating the standard of the project to the latest standard of C++23, Copilot responses now include newer C++ features that can be relevant to the question, such as std::ranges, to improve the code.\n\nWhat do you think?\nTry out the latest Chat improvements for your C++ workflows today. To access these updates to Copilot, you’ll need an active GitHub Copilot subscription and the latest version of Visual Studio.\nIn addition, our team is working hard on improving C++ integrations with Copilot, so please let us know any other enhancements you’d like to see to your C++ workflows and content you’d like to see. Comment below, or you can find us via email at visualcpp@microsoft.com or via X at @VisualC.\n \n \n \nThe post Document build instructions and more with enhanced C++ awareness from Copilot Chat in Visual Studio appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how Meta built support for data logs, which provide people with additional data about how they use our products.\nHere we explore initial system designs we considered, an overview of the current architecture, and some important principles Meta takes into account in making data accessible and easy to understand. \nUsers have a variety of tools they can use to manage and access their information on Meta platforms. Meta is always looking for ways to enhance its access tools in line with technological advances, and in February 2024 we began including data logs in the Download Your Information (DYI) tool. Data logs include things such as information about content you’ve viewed on Facebook. Some of this data can be unique, but it can also include additional details about information that we already make available elsewhere, such as through a user’s profile, products like Access Your Information or Activity Log, or account downloads. This update is the result of significant investments over a number of years by a large cross-functional team at Meta, and consultations with experts on how to continue enhancing our access tools.\nData logs are just the most recent example of how Meta gives users the power to access their data on our platforms. We have a long history of giving users transparency and control over their data:\n2010: Users can retrieve a copy of their information through DYI. \n2011: Users can easily review actions taken on Facebook through Activity Log.\n2014: Users have more transparency and control over ads they see with the “Why Am I Seeing This Ad?” feature on Facebook.\n2018: Users have a curated experience to find information about them through Access Your Information. Users can retrieve a copy of their information on Instagram through Download Your Data and on WhatsApp through Request Account Information.\n2019: Users can view their activity off Meta-technologies and clear their history. Meta joins the Data Transfer Project and has continuously led the development of shared technologies that enable users to port their data from one platform to another. \n2020: Users continue to receive more information in DYI such as additional information about their interactions on Facebook and Instagram.\n2021: Users can more easily navigate categories of information in Access Your Information\n2023: Users can more easily use our tools as access features are consolidated within Accounts Center.\n2024: Users can access data logs in Download Your Information.\nWhat are data logs?\nIn contrast to our production systems, which can be queried billions of times per second thanks to techniques like caching, Meta’s data warehouse, powered by Hive, is designed to support low volumes of large queries for things like analytics and cannot scale to the query rates needed to power real-time data access.\nWe created data logs as a solution to provide users who want more granular information with access to data stored in Hive. In this context, an individual data log entry is a formatted version of a single row of data from Hive that has been processed to make the underlying data transparent and easy to understand.\nObtaining this data from Hive in a format that can be presented to users is not straightforward. Hive tables are partitioned, typically by date and time, so retrieving all the data for a specific user requires scanning through every row of every partition to check whether it corresponds to that user. Facebook has over 3 billion monthly active users, meaning that, assuming an even distribution of data, ~99.999999967% of the rows in a given Hive table might be processed for such a query even though they won’t be relevant. \nOvercoming this fundamental limitation was challenging, and adapting our infrastructure to enable it has taken multiple years of concerted effort. Data warehouses are commonly used in a range of industry sectors, so we hope that this solution should be of interest to other companies seeking to provide access to the data in their data warehouses.\nInitial designs\nWhen we started designing a solution to make data logs available, we first considered whether it would be feasible to simply run queries for each individual as they requested their data, despite the fact that these queries would spend almost all of their time processing irrelevant data. Unfortunately, as we highlighted above, the distribution of data at Meta’s scale makes this approach infeasible and incredibly wasteful: It would require scanning entire tables once per DYI request, scaling linearly with the number of individual users that initiate DYI requests. These performance characteristics were infeasible to work around. \nWe also considered caching data logs in an online system capable of supporting a range of indexed per-user queries. This would make the per-user queries relatively efficient. However, copying and storing data from the warehouse in these other systems presented material computational and storage costs that were not offset by the overall effectiveness of the cache, making this infeasible as well. \nCurrent design\nFinally, we considered whether it would be possible to build a system that relies on amortizing the cost of expensive full table scans by batching individual users’ requests into a single scan. After significant engineering investigation and prototyping, we determined that this system provides sufficiently predictable performance characteristics to infrastructure teams to make this possible. Even with this batching over short periods of time, given the relatively small size of the batches of requests for this information compared to the overall user base, most of the rows considered in a given table are filtered and scoped out as they are not relevant to the users whose data has been requested. This is a necessary trade off to enable this information to be made accessible to our users.\nIn more detail, following a pre-defined schedule, a job is triggered using Meta’s internal task-scheduling service to organize the most recent requests, over a short time period, for users’ data logs into a single batch. This batch is submitted to a system built on top of Meta’s Core Workflow Service (CWS). CWS provides a useful set of guarantees that enable long-running tasks to be executed with predictable performance characteristics and reliability guarantees that are critical for complex multi-step workflows.\nOnce the batch has been queued for processing, we copy the list of user IDs who have made requests in that batch into a new Hive table. For each data logs table, we initiate a new worker task that fetches the relevant metadata describing how to correctly query the data. Once we know what to query for a specific table, we create a task for each partition that executes a job in Dataswarm (our data pipeline system). This job performs an INNER JOIN between the table containing requesters’ IDs and the column in each table that identifies the owner of the data in that row. As tables in Hive may leverage security mechanisms like access control lists (ACLs) and privacy protections built on top of Meta’s Privacy Aware Infrastructure, the jobs are configured with appropriate security and privacy policies that govern access to the data.\nA diagram showing how a workflow gathers inputs and runs sub-workflows for each table and partition to reliably gather data logs. The data logs workflow will gather metadata, then prepare requester IDs, then run parallel processes for each table. Each table workflow prepares the table, then runs approximately sequential jobs for each partition. Some partitions across tables may be processed in parallel.\nOnce this job is completed, it outputs its results to an intermediate Hive table containing a combination of the data logs for all users in the current batch. This processing is expensive, as the INNER JOIN requires a full table scan across all relevant partitions of the Hive table, an operation which may consume significant computational resources. The output table is then processed using PySpark to identify the relevant data and split it into individual files for each user’s data in a given partition. \nA diagram showing that the processing of each partition splits the data into one file per user per partition. Both users A and B will have a file representing Table 1 Partition 1, and so on.\nThe result of these batch operations in the data warehouse is a set of comma delimited text files containing the unfiltered raw data logs for each user. This raw data is not yet explained or made intelligible to users, so we run a post-processing step in Meta’s Hack language to apply privacy rules and filters and render the raw data into meaningful, well-explained HTML files. We do this by passing the raw data through various renderers, discussed in more detail in the next section. Finally, once all of the processing is completed, the results are aggregated into a ZIP file and made available to the requestor through the DYI tool.\nLessons learned from building data logs\nThroughout the development of this system we found it critical to develop robust checkpointing mechanisms that enable incremental progress and resilience in the face of errors and temporary failures. While processing everything in a single pass may reduce latency, the risk is that a single issue will cause all of the previous work to be wasted. For example, in addition to jobs timing out and failing to complete, we also experienced errors where full-table-scan queries would run out of memory and fail partway through processing. The capability to resume work piecemeal increases resiliency and optimizes the overall throughput of the system.\nA diagram explaining that checkpointing after incremental task completions can optimize system throughput. Approach 1 shows one task failure on step 2, which is recomputed successfully. Approach 2 combines everything into one step, but when it fails, it winds up taking longer overall.\nEnsuring data correctness is also very important. As we built the component that splits combined results into individual files for each user, we encountered an issue that affected this correctness guarantee and could have led to data being returned to the wrong user. The root cause of the issue was a Spark concurrency bug that partitioned data incorrectly across the parallel Spark workers. To prevent this issue, we built verification in the post-processing stage to ensure that the user ID column in the data matches the identifier for the user whose logs we are generating. This means that even if similar bugs were to occur in the core data processing infrastructure we would prevent any incorrect data from being shown to users. \nFinally, we learned that complex data workflows require advanced tools and the capability to iterate on code changes quickly without re-processing everything. To this end, we built an experimentation platform that enables running modified versions of the workflows to quickly test changes, with the ability to independently execute phases of the process to expedite our work. For example, we found that innocent-looking changes such as altering which column is being fetched can lead to complex failures in the data fetching jobs.  We now have the ability to run a test job under the new configuration when making a change to a table fetcher.\nMaking data consistently understandable and explainable\nMeta cares about ensuring that the information we provide is meaningful to end-users. A key challenge in providing transparent access is presenting often highly technical information in a way that is approachable and easy to understand, even for those with little expertise in technology. \nProviding people access to their data involves working across numerous products and surfaces that our users interact with every day. The way that information is stored on our back-end systems is not always directly intelligible to end-users, and it takes both understanding of the individual products and features as well as the needs of users to make it user-friendly. This is a large, collaborative undertaking, leveraging many forms of expertise. Our process entails working with product teams familiar with the data from their respective products, applying our historical expertise in access surfaces, using innovative tools we have developed, and consulting with experts.\nIn more detail, a cross-functional team of access experts works with specialist teams to review these tables, taking care to avoid exposing information that could adversely affect the rights and freedoms of other users. For example, if you block another user Facebook, this information would not be provided to the person that you have blocked. Similarly, when you view another user’s profile, this information will be available to you, but not the person whose profile you viewed. This is a key principle Meta upholds to respect the rights of everyone who engages with our platforms. It also means that we need a rigorous process to ensure that the data made available is never shared incorrectly. Many of the datasets that power a social network will reference more than one person, but that does not imply everyone referenced should always have equal access to that information. \nAdditionally, Meta must take care not to disclose information that may compromise our integrity or safety systems, or our intellectual property rights. For instance, Meta sends millions of NCMEC Cybertip reports per year to help protect children on our platforms. Disclosing this information, or the data signals used to detect apparent violations of laws protecting children, may undermine the sophisticated techniques we have developed to proactively seek out and report these types of content and interactions. \nOne particularly time consuming and challenging task is ensuring that Meta-internal text strings that describe our systems and products are translated into more easily human readable terms. For instance, a Hack enum could define a set of user interface element references. Exposing the jargon-heavy internal versions of these enums would definitely not be meaningful to an end-user — they may not be meaningful at first glance to other employees without sufficient context! In this case, user-friendly labels are created to replace these internal-facing strings. The resulting content is reviewed for explainability, simplicity, and consistency, with product experts also helping to verify that the final version is accurate.\nThis process makes information more useful by reducing duplicative information. When engineers build and iterate on a product for our platforms, they may log slightly different versions of the same information with the goal of better understanding how people use the product. For example, when users select an option from a list of actions, each part of the system may use slightly different values that represent the same underlying option, such as an option to move content to trash as part of Manage Activity.  As a concrete example, we found this action stored with different values: In the first instance it was entered as MOVE_TO_TRASH, in the second as StoryTrashPostMenuItem, and in the third FBFeedMoveToTrashOption. These differences stemmed from the fact that the logging in question was coming from different parts of the system with different conventions. Through a  series of cross-functional reviews with support from product experts, Meta determines an appropriate column header (e.g., “Which option you interacted with”), and the best label for the option (e.g., “Move to trash”).\nFinally, once content has been reviewed, it can be implemented in code using the renderers we described above. These are responsible for reading the raw values and transforming them into user-friendly representations. This includes transforming raw integer values into meaningful references to entities and converting raw enum values into user-friendly representations. An ID like 1786022095521328 might become “John Doe”; enums with integer values 0, 1, 2, converted into text like “Disabled,” “Active,” or “Hidden;”and columns with string enums can remove jargon that is not understandable to end-users and de-duplicate (as in our “Move to trash” example above). \nTogether, these culminate in a much friendlier representation of the data that might look like this:\nAn example of what a data log might look like, demonstrating meaningful and intelligible output. It shows column headers with descriptions and a row of data.\nThe post Data logs: The latest evolution in Meta’s access tools appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve previously described why we think it’s time to leave the leap second in the past. In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, introducing new leap seconds to account for the long-term slowdown of the Earth’s rotation is a risky practice that, frankly, does more harm than good. This is particularly true in the data center space, where new protocols like Precision Time Protocol (PTP) are allowing systems to be synchronized down to nanosecond precision.  \nWith the ever-growing demand for higher precision time distribution, and the larger role of PTP for time synchronization in data centers, we need to consider how to address leap seconds within systems that use PTP and are thus much more time sensitive.\nLeap second smearing – a solution past its time\nLeap second smearing is a process of adjusting the speeds of clocks to accommodate the correction that has been a common method for handling leap seconds. At Meta, we’ve traditionally focused our smearing effort on NTP since it has been the de facto standard for time synchronization in data centers.\nIn large NTP deployments, leap second smearing is generally performed at the Stratum 2 (layer), which consists of NTP servers that directly interact with NTP clients (the Stratum 3) that are the downstream users of the NTP service.\n \nThere are multiple approaches to smearing. In the case of NTP, linear or quadratic smearing formulas can be applied.\nQuadratic smearing is often preferred due to the layered nature of the NTP protocol, where clients are encouraged to dynamically adjust their polling interval as the value of pending correction increases. This solution has its own tradeoffs, such as inconsistent adjustments, which can lead to different offset values across a large server fleet. \nLinear smearing may be superior if an entire fleet is relying on the same time sources and performs smearing at the same time. In combination with more frequent sync cycles of typically once per second, this is a more predictable, precise and reliable approach.\n\nHandling leap seconds in PTP\nIn contrast to NTP, which synchronizes at the millisecond level, PTP provides a level of precision typically in the range of nanoseconds. At this level of precision even periodic linear smearing would create too much delta across the fleet and violate guarantees provided to the customers.\nTo handle leap seconds in a PTP environment we take an algorithmic approach that shifts time automatically for systems that use PTP and combine this with an emphasis on using Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) over International Atomic Time (TAI).\nSelf-smearing\nAt Meta, users interact with the PTP service via the fbclock library, which provides a tuple of values, {earliest_ns, latest_ns}, which represents a time interval referred to as the Window of Uncertainty (WOU). Each time the library is called during the smearing period we adjust the return values based on the smearing algorithm, which shifts the time values 1 nanosecond every 62.5 microseconds.\nThis approach has a number of advantages, including being completely stateless and reproducible. The service continues to utilize TAI timestamps but can return UTC timestamps to clients via the API. And, as the start time is determined by tzdata timestamps, the current smearing position can be determined even after a server is rebooted.\nThis approach does come with some tradeoffs. For example, as the leap smearing strategy differs between the NTP (quadratic) and PTP (linear) ecosystems, services may struggle to match timestamps acquired from different sources during the smearing period. \nThe difference between two approaches can mean differences of over 100 microseconds, creating challenges for services that consume time from both systems.\nUTC over TAI\nThe smearing strategy we implemented in our fbclock library shows good performance. However, it still introduces significant time deltas between multiple hosts during the smearing period, despite being fully stateless and using small (1 nanosecond) and fixed step sizes. \nAnother significant drawback comes from periodically running jobs. Smearing time means our scheduling is off by close to 1 millisecond after 60 seconds for services that run at precise intervals. \n\nThis is not ideal for a service that guarantees nanosecond-level accuracy and precision.\nAs a result, we recommend that customers use TAI over UTC and thus avoid having to deal with the leap seconds. Unfortunately, though, in most cases, the conversion to UTC is still required and eventually has to be performed somewhere.\nPTP without leap seconds\nAt Meta, we support the recent push to freeze any new leap seconds after 2035. If we can cease the introduction of new leap seconds, then the entire industry can rely on UTC instead of TAI for higher precision timekeeping. This will simplify infrastructure and remove the need for different smearing solutions.\nUltimately, a future without leap seconds is one where we can push systems to greater levels of timekeeping precision more easily and efficiently.\nThe post How Precision Time Protocol handles leap seconds appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Learning the theory of computations might not be the most direct path to video game development. However, you still need to learn programming, some math (at least geometry), and mechanics – or as it’s often somewhat erroneously labeled – physics. Many years ago, I did a course on rigid body dynamics that was definitely a part of the theoretical mechanics curriculum, not physics! Then, you’ll probably also need a bit of materials science, optics, and a smattering of other subjects. The good news is you’ll have loads of fun along the way. And while you’re still learning, game development engines and libraries can help you keep on top of some of the accidental complexity and give you enough functionality to implement the things you want, albeit at a fairly basic level.\nIn this blog post, I’ll try to give you enough knowledge to kick off your journey in game development with the Rust programming language, the Bevy game engine, and RustRover, a dedicated JetBrains IDE for Rust developers. We’ll start with a tiny example and develop it a bit further, discussing the most important concepts and ideas along the way. You’ll also find some tips on where to find additional resources to help you continue on your learning journey.\nWhy use an engine? Why choose Bevy?\nLet’s start with the first question: Why do we need an engine at all? Well, creating even the smallest and simplest game imaginable requires implementing many things. You need a game loop, some game data, and a place to store everything. Some sort of UI, whether textual or graphical, will also be required so that we can render our game data. The game state will also need to change in reaction to human player inputs. At some point, you’ll need to render a 3D object, and this will force you to consider light, shadows, and reflection. It’s even possible that two geometrically complex bodies will collide, an action that will then need to be detected and processed. All these tasks are important game components, and some sort of system should be in place to make sure they’re available.\nImplementing a full-fledged game engine or certain parts thereof from scratch is an extremely popular use case. While this is an interesting topic in its own right, this blog post will focus on Bevy, the most popular Rust game development engine. Bevy is full-featured, so we can do a lot of different things. It’s flexible, so we can do whatever we want without constraint. It’s also extendable, so we can add external plugins to get new functionality. Bevy is a project under active development, so we should expect many changes to come with every release. Still, it’s crucial to have a basic grasp of its core concepts and features if we want to be able to follow its future progress.\nYour first Bevy application\nLet’s look at our first Bevy application:\nuse bevy::prelude::*;\n\nfn main() {\n   App::new()\n       .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n       .run();\n}\nEven in this tiny example, we create an application, add some default plugins, and then run it. The App::run method runs the main game loop, even though we haven’t asked it to do anything yet. Nonetheless, some of the plugins will run their own internal processes.\nIf you create an empty project in RustRover and paste this code into main.rs, you’ll immediately see a suggestion to add a dependency for the bevy crate to your Cargo.toml file:\n[package]\nname = \"bevy-first-steps\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nedition = \"2021\"\n\n[dependencies]\nbevy = \"0.15\"\nYou can also get a sneak peek of what is included in the set of default plugins:\n\n\n\n\nFor example, there’s WindowPlugin, which creates an empty application window:\n\n\n\n\nWith TimePlugin, we get time-measuring functionality, and LogPlugin adds the ability to write logs. The documentation popup also mentions the bevy crate features. Plugins and features allow Bevy to be flexible: We can easily switch features on and off and add or remove plugins to get the desired set of functionality. You can read more about the default set of features in the documentation:\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to customize a set of enabled features, just start typing in the Cargo.toml file, where you’ll get full editing and completion support from RustRover:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBevy has excellent documentation, and the sections you might need are easily accessible from RustRover. You can read sections in popups, follow links, or even open the dedicated Documentation tool window:\n\n\n\n\nNow that we know how to get help in case of emergency, we’re ready to implement our first game element. So without further ado, let’s create our first object in the game world and make it jump!\nTime to jump\nBefore we get to the technical part, we’ll begin by considering what it actually means for a game object to jump. There are several key points that we need to keep in mind:\nWe need an object with geometrical parameters (width, height, and initial position within the graphical window).\nJumping means changing an object’s position in time, but not its size in our case (in contrast to a jumping ball, for example, which does change its size when it meets the ground – it’s not a rigid body!).\nJust like in real life, an initial force should be applied to an object to change its velocity and, consequently, its position. \nIn games, it’s usually up to a player to decide when to apply that force. Hence, we need to wait for and process user input (for example, when a user presses the space button).\nRight after an object gets its initial velocity, gravity influences it and works to return it to the ground.\nFor smooth visualization, we must ensure that our jumping object is rendered in various positions above the ground. \nSo, as it turns out, jumping is not that easy after all! And we haven’t even started to implement all these things in Bevy. Now, let’s talk about the concepts and actions from the list above in the direct context of Bevy:\nA game object is an entity, but it’s not the only entity we need in this program. For example, we need an entity for a camera to see something rendered in the graphical window. The ground can be represented with an entity as well. At least, we’ll need to render it. An entity is just an ID of an object (our jumping object or something coming from the engine), not an object itself. We need IDs to refer to and manipulate objects. To use the language of Bevy, we spawn entities.\nTo specify an object’s parameters, we use components and bundles of components. For example, an object’s velocity is a component (a 3D vector, as we’ll see soon). The marker structure we’ll use to associate a spawned entity with a jumping object is also a component. An object’s position is a component. This component is used for rendering an object. Bevy’s camera is a complex bundle of components (fortunately, we don’t have to analyze them in detail). \nWhen we spawn entities, we also associate them with their related components. Later, we’ll be able to query the actual values of components (for example, to change them or to render the corresponding game objects).\nUser input is represented in Bevy as a stream of events. We need to read those events and act accordingly.\nAll changes and visualizations in the game world are represented by systems, Rust functions that spawn entities, query the values of components, mutate them, read event streams, delete entities, and much more. In Bevy, systems are responsible for doing virtually everything. Bevy’s core functionality and anything provided by a plugin also take the form of systems. In this tutorial, you’ll see how we can implement our own systems.\nBevy doesn’t run systems chaotically. Instead, it uses schedules to decide what to run and when. Some systems need to be run only once at launch, while others run repeatedly on every frame.\nThe game is structured around frames: Any game is a sequence of frames that follow one another. The App::run method we saw in our first code sample generates frames by calling a variety of our own systems and other internal ones on every frame. \nNow, we are ready to create the following mental model of any Bevy application: We first set up entities with components and then change them into systems run by Bevy that are then rendered frame after frame. Bevy is an ECS (entity, component, system) framework, and everything we do with Bevy follows this pattern.\nI know you’re waiting for the code, so let’s go right ahead and spawn our first entities for the example of a jumping object:\nconst GROUND_LEVEL: f32 = -100.0;\nconst PLAYER_X: f32 = -300.0;\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Player;\n\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Velocity(Vec3);\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n   commands.spawn(Camera2d::default());\n  \n   // Player\n   commands\n       .spawn((\n           Player,\n           Sprite {\n               color: Color::srgb(0.5, 1.0, 0.5),\n               custom_size: Some(Vec2::new(30.0, 50.0)),\n               anchor: Anchor::BottomCenter,\n               ..default()\n           },\n           Transform::from_xyz(PLAYER_X, GROUND_LEVEL, 0.0),\n           Velocity(Vec3::ZERO)\n       ));\n  \n   // Ground\n   commands.spawn((\n       Sprite {\n           color: Color::srgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5),\n           custom_size: Some(Vec2::new(800.0, 10.0)),\n           anchor: Anchor::TopLeft,\n           ..default()\n       },\n       Transform::from_xyz(-400.0, GROUND_LEVEL, 0.0)\n   ));\n}\nThe setup function is a system. In this system, we are spawning three entities:\nOne entity for Bevy’s camera.\nAnother entity for a jumping object (a player). Note that we represent a player with a bundle of components:\n\nA marker struct Player.\nA sprite – Bevy’s concept that allows us to specify the visual identity of an object including color, size, and potentially many other parameters – even your own graphics.\nA transform – Bevy’s concept for an object’s position, used by Bevy to render our object in a correct place in the graphical window.\nA velocity.\nThe third entity represents the ground – we need it to see when jumping starts.\nThe setup system takes Commands as an argument. Commands are used to change the structure of the game world, such as by spawning or deleting entities. As we’ll see later, we don’t need them to read or change the values of components. We’ll use queries for that. \nLook at the anchor and transform components associated with the last two entities. We want the object (a rectangle) to stand on the ground. These two objects share the same y-coordinate in their initial positions but use different anchors. As a result, the player’s bottom side is the same as the ground’s top side.\nNothing will be rendered even if you copy this code to the example. Why? Because we need to run this system as part of our game loop. To do that, we register it within the application:\nfn main() {\n   App::new()\n       .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n       .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n       .run();\n}\nNote the Startup schedule. Our entities only need to be set up once during startup. Once this is done, we can see our amazing game object standing on the ground!\n\n\n\n\nHey, but that’s not jumping, right? Right, just bear with me. We’re almost there. We simply need to process user input and change the player’s velocity and position by applying the jumping force and gravity. As opposed to just being launched at startup, this behavior needs to be applied to every frame. To implement it, we’ll need to write three systems:\nThe jump system, which applies a jump force to the game object and sets the player’s velocity to a positive value when requested by a user.\nThe apply_gravity system, which slows the object down by decreasing its velocity. This requires checking the time that passes between consecutive frames. In Bevy terms, time is a resource, a global value that exists independently of entities and any components associated with them. Remember the TimePlugin that was added along with the other default plugins? This is the plugin that provides us with access to this resource. \nThe player_movement system, which is responsible for recalculating the player’s position. This system also needs to know the actual time because the more time that has passed, the further the player has been moved.\nThese systems run between frame updates, hence the Update schedule that we use to register them within the application:\nfn main() {\n   App::new()\n       .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n       .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n       .add_systems(Update, (jump, apply_gravity, player_movement))\n       .run();\n}\nThese three systems don’t manipulate entities. Instead, they read events (user input), query and mutate the components, and consult the time. In Bevy, we give them access to all this information by specifying system parameters: EventReader, Query, or Res for resources. \nLet’s look at the jump system first. We start by checking the event stream, and if we see a user pressing the space key, we apply a jump force:\nconst JUMP_FORCE: f32 = 600.0;\nfn jump(\n   mut events: EventReader<KeyboardInput>,\n   mut query: Query<(&mut Velocity, &Transform), With<Player>>\n) {\n   for e in events.read() {\n       if let Ok((mut velocity, transform)) =\n               query.get_single_mut() {\n           if e.state.is_pressed() && e.key_code == KeyCode::Space\n               && transform.translation.y <= GROUND_LEVEL {\n               velocity.0.y = JUMP_FORCE;\n           }\n       }\n   }\n}\nSometimes it can be helpful to read the list of parameters out loud:\nWe’re getting an event reader with keyboard input.\nWe’re querying velocity and transform (position) for entities marked as Player. The velocity is expected to be a mutable reference because we’re going to change it.\nWith Bevy, it doesn’t take long to start parsing complex query types. Query types specify what we are looking for in the entities and associated components. Bevy will then call these functions and supply them with the requested parameters.\nIn the system’s code, we check for all the unprocessed events that are available when Bevy runs this system. We get the queried components for every event, ensure the space key has been pressed, check that the player is on the ground (it’s a bit difficult to jump in the middle of another jump!), and finally make the jump happen by setting the velocity’s y-coordinate to some positive value. And we’re off!\nHere’s an essential consideration: With Bevy, we never attempt to do many things at once in a single system. It’s much easier to reason about game logic when we have multiple systems, each responsible for its own thing. Jumping is not about changing positions, it’s about applying the initial force. We’ll deal with changing positions in a system responsible specifically for that, namely player_movement: \nfn player_movement(\n   time: Res<Time>,\n   mut query: Query<(&mut Transform, &mut Velocity), With<Player>>\n) {\n   for (mut transform, mut velocity)\n           in query.iter_mut() {\n       transform.translation.y += velocity.0.y * time.delta_secs();\n       if transform.translation.y <= GROUND_LEVEL {\n           transform.translation.y = GROUND_LEVEL;\n           velocity.0.y = 0.0;\n       }\n   }\n}\nIn this system, we request access to time, player position, and velocity. In the code snippet, we simply iterate through all of the query results to find the one we need, even though we know there’s only one player. But imagine having many players. We need to be prepared!\nWe update the player’s y-coordinate for every transform and velocity according to the time that has passed between frame updates. We also ensure that our player never gets below the ground level by ensuring velocity is zeroed when ground level is reached.\nWhile it would be nice to be able to fly like a bird, in our game world, we need gravity.\nconst GRAVITY: f32 = -800.0;\nfn apply_gravity(\n   time: Res<Time>,\n   mut query: Query<&mut Velocity, With<Player>>\n) {\n   for mut velocity in query.iter_mut() {\n       velocity.0.y += GRAVITY * time.delta_secs();\n   }\n}\nGravity is a force that decreases the player’s velocity when jumping. Note that, once again, there is no need to recalculate position here. We need to apply gravity, so we apply gravity and nothing more.\nI recommend exploring this example’s code in RustRover. Play with the declared constants and initial values of components, run the application many times, explore Bevy’s types and methods, and check their signatures and documentation. There’s a whole world of stuff happening behind the scenes.  \nWhen you’re ready, we’ll turn this game into an endless runner: Our player will jump over randomly emerging obstacles, crash into them, lose health points, and eventually die, effectively putting an end to our game.\nFor an endless run!\nHere’s our plan for this section:\nSpawn and despawn entities, and move them to mimic horizontal movement.\nImplement a simplified collision detection system.\nOrganize a method to count health points and end the game when all the health points have been lost due to collisions.\nIn RustRover, we can use either the Structure tool window or the Collapse All action (Folding | Collapse All in the popup menu) to get a quick view of the final result:\n\n\n\n\nI realize the gameplay is far from rivetting, but hopefully you can enjoy playing it for a few seconds at least!\n\n\n\n\nFrom here on out, we’ll show more code examples and provide fewer explanations. The goal is to focus on introducing new Bevy parts without carefully analyzing what’s happening. Don’t forget to consult the documentation!\nDealing with obstacles: more timers and random numbers\nThe idea is to spawn a new obstacle every second. We already know how to consider times between frame updates with Res<Time>. Those times are smaller than a second, so we need another way to work with this specific time interval. Let’s create another resource for measuring one-second intervals. This requires a couple of changes. First, we need to define a constant and a structure with a timer:\nconst SPAWN_INTERVAL: f32 = 1.0;\n\n#[derive(Resource)]\nstruct ObstacleSpawningTimer(Timer);\nSecond, we initialize the timer and register it within the application:\nApp::new()\n   .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n   .add_systems(Startup, setup)\n   .insert_resource(ObstacleSpawningTimer(\n                       Timer::from_seconds(SPAWN_INTERVAL, \n                                  TimerMode::Repeating)))\nNow we can advance this timer with every frame update and spawn a new obstacle once the timer has counted down to zero:\nfn spawn_obstacles(\n   mut commands: Commands,\n   time: Res<Time>,\n   mut spawn_timer: ResMut<ObstacleSpawningTimer>,\n) {\n   spawn_timer.0.tick(time.delta()); // Advancing\n   if spawn_timer.0.finished() {\n       // Spawn the obstacle\n       // ...\n   }\n}\nThanks to TimerMode::Repeating, our timer repeats after finishing, so we get an infinite sequence of obstacles. There’s one issue, though. We want obstacles to have random positions. So, how do we get random numbers? One common solution would be to use the well-known rand crate, but the problem here is that we’re not in complete control of our application: Bevy is. What we need is a random number generator. But how do we make one available in our systems? When working with Bevy, it’s best to look for crates that implement the required functionality but are also integrated with Bevy and its ECS framework. Fortunately, we have the bevy_rand crate that provides everything we need. I recommend reading the tutorial, as quite a few things should be considered when working with randomization in Bevy.\nTo introduce random numbers to our project, we add the following dependencies to our Cargo.toml file:\nrand_core = \"0.6.4\"\nbevy_rand = \"0.9\"\nbevy_prng = { version = \"0.9.0\", features = [\"wyrand\"] }\nThen, we add a plugin to the application:\nApp::new()\n   .add_plugins(DefaultPlugins)\n   .add_plugins(EntropyPlugin::<WyRand>::default())\n   // ...\nFinally, we’ll add a random number generator to the required system using the usual Bevy approach as follows:\nfn spawn_obstacles(\n   mut commands: Commands,\n   time: Res<Time>,\n   mut spawn_timer: ResMut<ObstacleSpawningTimer>,\n   mut rng: GlobalEntropy<WyRand>,\n) {\n   spawn_timer.0.tick(time.delta());\n   if spawn_timer.0.finished() {\n       let obstacle_x = GROUND_EDGE;\n       let obstacle_y = GROUND_LEVEL + (rng.next_u32() % 50) as f32;\n       commands.spawn((\n           Obstacle,\n           Sprite {\n               color: OBSTACLE_COLOR,\n               custom_size: Some(OBSTACLE_SIZE),\n               anchor: Anchor::BottomCenter,\n               ..default()\n           },\n           Transform::from_xyz(obstacle_x, obstacle_y, 0.0),\n       ));\n   }\n}\nThe movement of obstacles is implemented by decreasing their x-coordinates. Thus, users feel like the player is moving forward (from left to right):\nfn move_obstacles(\n   time: Res<Time>,\n   mut commands: Commands,\n   mut query: Query<(Entity, &mut Transform), With<Obstacle>>,\n) {\n   for (entity, mut transform) in query.iter_mut() {\n       transform.translation.x -= GAME_SPEED * time.delta_secs();\n\n\n       // Remove obstacles once they're off-screen\n       if transform.translation.x < -GROUND_EDGE {\n           commands.entity(entity).despawn();\n       }\n   }\n}\nOne interesting thing about the system above is that we can easily despawn entities once they are off the screen. We use Commands and the entity method to access the entity we’re interested in. We use the time between frame updates to recalculate current positions, just as before. By playing with the GAME_SPEED value, we can make the game slower or faster, for example, to increase or decrease the difficulty level. To do that at run time, we must make this constant a resource and access its value as needed.\nHealth points, collision detection, and text rendering\nNow we want to implement health points, set them to some initial value at the beginning of the game, and then decrease them with every collision. In other approaches, we need to add a heath field to some structure containing other information about the player. But that’s not the approach we use in Bevy. Instead, we define a new component:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct Health(usize);\nThen we associate it with the player’s entity at spawning:\n// Player\ncommands\n   .spawn((\n       Player,\n       Sprite {\n           ...\n       },\n       Transform::from_xyz(PLAYER_X, GROUND_LEVEL, 0.0),\n       Velocity(Vec3::ZERO),\n       Health(initial_health)\n   ));\nNow we can access the health value in order to read or mutate it depending on our use case. When we detect a collision, we decrease it. To render health information on the screen, we only require read access to the data.\nLet’s look at this simplistic implementation of collision detection:\nfn detect_collision(\n   mut commands: Commands,\n   mut player_query: Query<(&Transform, &mut Health), With<Player>>,\n   obstacle_query: Query<(Entity, &Transform), With<Obstacle>>,\n) {\n   if let Ok((player_transform, mut health)) =\n                               player_query.get_single_mut() {\n       for (entity, obstacle_transform) in obstacle_query.iter() {\n           let collision = player_transform.translation.distance(\n                                obstacle_transform.translation) < 50.0;\n           if collision {\n               health.0 -= 1;\n               commands.entity(entity).despawn(); // Remove obstacle\n           }\n       }\n   }\n}\nWe just compare the player’s position with that of obstacles, and if the player is close enough, then we count the situation as a collision and decrease the health points accordingly. The obstacle entity is despawned immediately.\nWe also need to render health information on the screen. To use the language of Bevy, we need to define a component, and then spawn and render a corresponding entity:\n#[derive(Component)]\nstruct HealthInfo;\n\nfn setup(mut commands: Commands) {\n   // ...\n   commands.spawn((\n           HealthInfo,\n           Text::new(format!(\"Health: {}\", initial_health))\n       )\n   );\n   // ...\n}\n\nfn render_health_info(\n   player_query: Query<&mut Health, With<Player>>,\n   mut health_info_query: Query<&mut Text, With<HealthInfo>>,\n) {\n   if let Ok(mut health_info) = health_info_query.get_single_mut() {\n       if let Ok(health) = player_query.get_single() {\n           health_info.0 = format!(\"Health: {}\", health.0);\n       }\n   }\n}\nIn the render_health_info system, we access the player’s health and info components and then update the text node with the actual data. Follow the documentation on the Text component to learn how to position the corresponding UI node and change its properties, such as font, size, color, etc. \nGame states and advanced system scheduling\nWhat should we do when a player loses all their health points? In other words, how should we implement the game over situation? The problem is that some systems need to stop being executed while others should start executing right when we reach this state. For example, we must prevent obstacles from moving and the player from jumping, while also displaying the “Game Over” text on the screen. To implement the desired behavior, we’ll apply Bevy’s states and use its additional scheduling features.\nWe need to introduce two states into our gameplay:\nInGame, which corresponds to the time we are playing.\nGameOver, which means that the game is over.\nWe might have more states in more advanced games, for example, for pausing the game or navigating a menu. In Bevy, we define the following structure with states and derive the required definitions:\n#[derive(States, Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash)]\nenum GameState {\n   InGame,\n   GameOver,\n}\nThen we register our initial state within the application:\nApp::new()\n   // ...\n   .insert_state(InGame)\n   // ...\nWhile in the game, we should consult the player’s health and then switch to GameOver if there are no health points left:\nfn check_health(\n   player_query: Query<&Health, With<Player>>,\n   mut game_state: ResMut<NextState<GameState>>\n) {\n   if let Ok(Health(health)) = player_query.get_single() {\n       if *health == 0 {\n           game_state.set(GameOver);\n       }\n   }\n}\nWhen the game is over, we display a huge banner in the center of the window:\nfn game_over(mut commands: Commands) {\n   commands.spawn((Node {\n       position_type: PositionType::Absolute,\n       left: Val::Percent(10.),\n       right: Val::Percent(10.),\n       top: Val::Percent(15.),\n       bottom: Val::Percent(15.),\n       justify_content: JustifyContent::Center,\n       ..default()\n   },))\n       .with_children(|builder| {\n           builder.spawn((\n               Text(\"GAME OVER\".to_string()),\n               TextFont::from_font_size(160.0),\n               TextLayout::new_with_justify(JustifyText::Center)\n                    .with_no_wrap(),\n               TextColor(Color::srgb(1.0, 0.0, 0.0)),\n           ));\n       });\n}\nOf course, we also need to specify when any given system should and should not be executed. We do that using the run_if schedule modifier and the OnEnter(GameOver) schedule as follows:\nApp::new()\n   // ...\n   .add_systems(Update, (jump, apply_gravity, player_movement)\n       .run_if(in_state(InGame)))\n   .add_systems(Update, (spawn_obstacles, move_obstacles,\n                         detect_collision, render_health_info,\n                         check_health)\n       .run_if(in_state(InGame)))\n   .add_systems(OnEnter(GameOver), game_over)\n   .run();\nSo, if the current state is InGame, we have eight systems to execute within the Update schedule (meaning on every frame update) and a single game_over system when we enter the GameOver state (meaning it is executed only once). \nI encourage you to play with the final implementation and try implementing many more features, for example:\nSpawning stars.\nGiving rewards for collecting stars.\nUsing more advanced graphics for game objects instead of boring rectangles.\nImplementing game levels.\nAnd beyond\nIt takes a lot of time to master game development and Bevy, which means it’s crucial to start applying your knowledge as early as possible. Make your own game right now! To help flatten the learning curve, I’ve composed the following list of helpful resources:\nBevy’s website is a great resource: You can find links to the documentation, community links, and official examples (make sure you check them out!), as well as a collection of third-party assets, learning resources, crates, and apps.\nBevy GameDev Meetups host a wide selection of general talks about Bevy as well as numerous deep-dives into specific features.\nThe Bevy Cheat Book can prove very helpful when you need to implement some highly specific functionalities.\nMigration guides like this one are also must-reads. Things in Bevy change frequently, so be prepared.\nIt’s also highly advisable that you learn about at least one physics engine for Bevy (e.g. avian), and I would recommend following Chris Biscardi and his This Week in Bevy project for valuable insights.\nThe fast pace of Bevy development creates many issues for both content creators and AI assistants. Materials on the internet and any AI-generated suggestions can easily be outdated. You should always keep in mind the Bevy version you are targeting and check the migration guides if you encounter any issues.\nConclusion\nGame development with Rust and Bevy is an exciting journey that requires a combination of creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills. From setting up your first Bevy project to implementing core game mechanics, every step reveals the power and flexibility of this ecosystem. Bevy’s entity-component-system (ECS) architecture might initially seem challenging, but its logic and elegance become increasingly apparent as you practice, enabling you to create scalable and maintainable games.\nWhile this blog post provides a solid foundation, learning begins when you start experimenting. Don’t hesitate to dive deeper into advanced topics like collision detection, procedural generation, or physics integration. Bevy’s vibrant community and extensive resources, including documentation, meetups, and third-party assets, will prove invaluable as you continue your educational journey.\nRemember, game development isn’t just about writing code but crafting experiences. Challenge yourself to create something unique, whether it’s a simple platformer or a complex simulation. Each project will teach you new concepts, spark new ideas, and bring you closer to mastering this craft.\nBevy’s rapid development pace is both an opportunity and a challenge. Stay informed about new updates, consult migration guides, and engage with the community to keep your skills sharp and your projects up to date. Whether exploring game design for fun or building a career in the industry, the combination of Rust, Bevy, and your creativity is a recipe for success.Now it’s time to roll up your sleeves, launch RustRover, start coding, and bring your game ideas to life. Good luck, and happy coding!",

This feature allows you to view Qt variables such as QString, QByteArray, and other data types in a human-readable form. This enhancement makes it much easier to develop and debug cross-platform applications with the Qt framework in CLion.\nIf you want to try the feature, download the EAP build for free from the link below, via the Toolbox App, or as a snap package if you’re using Ubuntu.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 EAP\nHow to configure Qt renderers \nThis feature is enabled by default, but to use it, you need to download the Qt renderers and specify the path to them:\nGo to Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Data Views | C/C++ | Enable Qt renderers.\nClick Download… next to the Qt renderers field. \nWhen the Download Qt Renderers window appears, click Download Qt Renderers. Once the download is complete, the path will be specified automatically.\n\n\n\n\n\nClick OK.\nAfter that, you can debug a Qt project and inspect Qt variables like any other project.\nHere is an example of what a variable looks like with Qt renderers enabled:\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, here is the same variable without Qt renderers:\n\n\n\n\nCurrent limitations\nQt renderers don’t yet work with remote and WSL toolchains. As soon as we add support for these toolchains, we’ll let you know.\nTry the feature and share your feedback\nYour feedback is important in helping us refine new features, especially during the Early Access Program. We encourage you to try Qt renderers and share your thoughts and suggestions by submitting a ticket to our issue tracker or commenting below.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 EAP\nTo learn about the other features we plan to introduce in v2025.1, read the blog post about our roadmap.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you work on large Unreal Engine projects in Rider, you’ve likely experienced the dreaded debug-step delay – hit F10 for Step Over, contemplate making coffee, then finally see the next line execute. \nThese delays occur in LLDB Debugger, the engine behind Rider’s debugging capabilities for C++ and other native languages. After months of focused optimization work, we’ve made significant improvements to our custom version of LLDB on Windows. As a result, Step Over has gotten a major speed boost – up to 50 times faster in certain cases. These improvements will debut in Rider 2025.1 and the EAP builds leading up to it.\nDownload Rider 2025.1 EAP\n                                                    \nIn this blog post, we’ll tell you about the game-changing optimizations that got us there.\nCreating a benchmarking environment\nOur initial challenge was to reproduce the slow stepping behavior users report. Standard Unreal Engine demos weren’t showing the full extent of the problem – the difference between a 10ms and 100ms step isn’t immediately obvious. The real issues emerge in massive projects with gigabytes of debug symbols.\nTo properly assess the situation and measure our improvements, we generated an extreme test case – a C++ project with a 1 GB binary and 8 GB of debug symbols to amplify the stepping delays our users might encounter.\nA look under the hood\nTo better understand our approach to tackling the performance issues, let’s look at how stepping actually works in Rider.\nLLDB Debugger is part of the LLVM-project-compiler infrastructure, designed specifically for C++ and other native languages. As part of the LLVM project, it provides low-level debugging capabilities essential for complex codebases. Rider maintains its own customized version of LLDB to ensure an optimal debugging experience for C++ projects, particularly with Unreal Engine development.\nWhen you press F10, the IDE sends a stepping request to LLDB, which must:\nFind the next stop location (the instruction address).\nPlace a software breakpoint there and resume the debugging process.\nAfter stopping at the instruction address, check if the step is really finished. If not, try again.\nOnce the step is finished, restore the call stacks.\nReport to the IDE that the step has finished.\nThe IDE requests all call stacks for all threads.\nThe IDE requests the visualization of local variables for the current frame from LLDB, which triggers dozens of expression evaluations in LLDB.\nThis process involves resolving symbols by addresses and names, as well as examining assembly instructions. The larger the debugging program and the more debug symbols it has, the slower these operations become. \nHere are some specifics on the optimizations we implemented to address this.\nOur optimization strategy\nNegative caching \nDuring stepping, LLDB makes numerous requests to debug symbols (PDB), most commonly to use addresses to resolve symbols. For example, when LLDB restores the call stack, it resolves every frame address using debug symbols from the PDB. Very often, the root (the bottom) of the call stack consists of functions like invoke_main(), __scrt_common_main_seh(), __scrt_common_main(), and mainCRTStartup(). These functions are compiled into the user application, but the compiler doesn’t provide debug symbols for them. As a result, LLDB cannot find any debug information for these addresses. \nAlthough LLDB was already caching successful lookups internally, we discovered that it was ignoring failed lookups, which turned out to be surprisingly expensive operations. Our implementation of caching for these failed results gave us an immediate performance boost.\nLooking beyond the mutex\nBecause LLDB is multithreaded, certain operations require mutex locks to ensure thread synchronization. For one, access to debug symbols is mutex-protected, which means we need to be extra cautious with these blocking operations in performance-heavy scenarios. Any slow operation with debug symbols inherently affects the entire stepping process. One such bottleneck turned out to be searching for template function symbols by name.\nWhy do we need to search for template functions at all? After each step, Rider asks LLDB to show you what’s in each variable in the current frame. To do this, LLDB uses Natvis, which might need dozens of expression evaluations for just one variable. Each evaluation means LLDB has to resolve names in the debug symbols, including trying to match type names against function names.\nThe core problem lies in how MSVC’s PDB files store template function names. Take test<const char *, int> as an example – LLDB won’t find it because MSVC expects test<char const *,int> (notice how const moved and the spaces disappeared). Previously, Rider’s LLDB would search for test<*> to try to find all possible matches. This is a seemingly simple solution, until you consider how many variations of std::unique_ptr<*> exist in a real project. This wildcard search became painfully slow with thousands of template instantiations.\n\nWe solved this by transforming the template name into MSVC’s exact format before searching. While LLDB still adds wildcards, the more specific name pattern dramatically reduces the search scope. This optimization not only significantly reduces template function search times but also fixes incorrect cast expression parsing.\nNext line, please!\nRider uses custom scripted thread plans rather than native LLDB stepping, which has Windows-specific issues. But how exactly does stepping work? When you invoke Step Over, you’re telling the debugger to advance to the next line – but finding that “next line” is trickier than it sounds.\nThe thread plan scans instructions starting from the program counter (RIP in x86_64) until it finds an instruction on a different line or hits a branch instruction (like jmp, call, ret) – even if that branch is on the same line. To actually move to the chosen instruction, LLDB uses software breakpoints, overwriting the target instruction with a breakpoint instruction (int3 in x86_64). After hitting the breakpoint and stopping, LLDB restores the original instruction and checks if this is where we really want to stop.\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting: sometimes that “next line” lands us inside an inlined function. While that’s fine for stepping in, it’s not what we want for stepping over. Previously, when the thread plan detected an inlined function, it had to repeat the whole process – find another instruction, set a breakpoint, and try again. In optimized builds with heavy inlining (very common in STL and Unreal Engine code), this could happen hundreds of times per step! Each round requires at least two memory writes, making it an expensive operation. \nOur fix? We now check instructions in advance and simply skip them if they’re in an inlined function.\nIs it a call? \nAnother key optimization focused on how thread plans identify call instructions. While LLDB’s SB API can check if an instruction is a branch, it lacks a direct method to identify calls specifically. This forced thread plans to check instruction mnemonics using the available method, which proved costly – resolving mnemonics requires parsing the complete instruction including operands and comments.\nTo solve this issue, we added a new method to the SB API that checks for calls by examining the instruction bytecode directly, bypassing the overhead of full instruction parsing.\nMeasuring the improvements\nWe compared stepping performance between Rider 2024.3 and 2025.1 across several scenarios, measuring the time between sending a stepping request to LLDB and receiving the first frame stack:\nLarge C++ project built without optimizations:\n\n\n\n\nSame project built with optimizations enabled:\n\n\n\n\nSame project build with optimizations, but specific scenarios where stepping operations previously caused 23-second delays:\n\n\n\n\nReal-world test using a sample game project built with Unreal Engine (320MB binary, 2.5GB debug symbols):\n\n\n\n\nThe improvements deliver up to 50x faster stepping times, with most operations now completing in under 100ms. While these extreme test cases may not reflect every project, developers working with large C++ codebases, particularly Unreal Engine projects, should notice significantly smoother debugging sessions.\nWe need your help\nThese debugging improvements will be available in Rider 2025.1, as well as the EAP builds leading up to its release. As we continue to work on the performance of the debugger, we’ll be looking out for edge cases that might need additional optimization. Here’s where your input is invaluable! \nWe’ve put together a self-profiler for you to use whenever you’re dealing with slow stepping through C++ code. The Profile Native Debugger Process action can be invoked via Search Everywhere or from the Help menu.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you trigger this action, the IDE will ask you to grant administrative privileges for profiling. Once you’re done profiling the problematic actions of the debugger, you’ll get a notification with a link to the resulting snapshot. This snapshot can then be shared with us on YouTrack and Zendesk and may be a crucial asset in future investigations. We appreciate your help in perfecting the debugger with us.\nDownload Rider 2025.1 EAP\n                                                    \nSpecial thanks to:\nMikhail Zakharov for developing the self-profiler.\nAleksei Gusarov for thorough code reviews.",

AI의 답변은 기본적으로 통계에 기반해 높은 확률의 정답을 뽑아주는 것에 가깝다. 따라서 ChatGPT 같은 기존 AI들은 질문을 받았을 때 거대한 데이터를 돌려서 적절한 답을 출력한다. 최종 사용자는 인식하지 못하지만 질문이 입력되는 순간 저 먼 곳 어딘가의 데이터센터에서 AI가 수많은 계산을 벌이고, 정답에 가까운 근사값들을 뽑아낸 뒤, 그 중 하나의 정답을 선택해 사용자에게 제시한다.\n예를 들어, 거대한 도서관(인터넷)에 다가가 사서에게 “새우튀김을 바삭하게 튀기는 법에 대한 요리책을 찾아줘”라고 부탁한다 가정해 보자. 기존의 사서(옛 AI)들은 ‘새우튀김’이라는 표제어의 책을 찾거나, ‘요리책’ 분류의 서가를 뒤진다. 수십-수백권 정도의 책을 수십분 정도 뒤지면 가능한 일이지만 불편하고 부정확하다. 반면 ChatGPT 같은 사서는 머릿속에 도서관의 모든 책을 기억해 두고, 예전 도서관 방문자들의 모든 요청도 기억해 둔다. 심지어 어떤 책을 꺼내줬을 때 사용자의 추가 요청은 없었는지, 만족한다는 피드백을 남겼는지도 동시에 고려한다. 전통적인 사서는 할 수 없는 일이었지만 데이터센터와 엔비디아칩으로 무장한 ChatGPT 사서라면 가능하다. 방문자는 ChatGPT 사서에게 한 권의 책을 정답(hard target)으로 받게 되지만, 이 책을 제시하기 위해 ChatGPT 사서는 뒷켠에 수십권의 유사한 책(soft target)도 쌓아놓는다.\n증류 기법은 여기서 등장한다. ChatGPT처럼 수억권의 책을 기억하는 대신 ChatGPT 같은 거대 모델을 미리 만들어 두고, 이 모델이 만들어 놓은 수십권의 책들(soft target)만 가지고 사서(DeepSeek)를 교육시키면 어떨까? 방문자가 요리책을 요청할 때, ChatGPT는 도서관 전체를 뒤져보고 답을 내놓아야 하지만, 딥시크는 요리책 전문 사서에게 배운 요령을 활용해 적절한 답을 내놓기 때문에 수백 수천배 쉽고 빠르게 답할 수 있지 않을까? 수천가지 분야에 대해 수십권의 정보를 저장하는 일은 엄청나 보이지만, 수억권의 책을 한번에 파악하고 답을 내는 것과 비교하면 훨씬 쉬운 일이다.\n여기서 가장 중요한 질문이 등장한다. 그렇다면, 딥시크가 학습을 위한 거대 모델을 스스로 만들지 않고 이미 외부에 존재하는 거대 모델(ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude 등등)을 활용했다면 어떻게 되는 걸까?\n기존 AI회사들은 이미 약관을 통해 다른 AI 기업이 학습 목적으로 자신들의 AI를 쓰지 못하도록 규정을 마련해 놓았다. 하지만 규정을 마련했다고 질문을 던지고 답을 얻는 과정 자체를 차단할 수는 없다. 그래서 오픈AI는 딥시크를 거꾸로 분석해 이 회사가 자신들의 AI를 활용한 증거를 수집하고 있다. 아래 그림이 뜻하는게 바로 이런 얘기다.(물론 딥시크는 이런 오픈AI의 주장을 인정하지 않았다.)\n오픈AI와 딥시크 사이의 갈등은 사실 기업 간 갈등에 지나지 않는다. 산업으로 보면 더 심각하다. ChatGPT 같은 새로운 AI는 끝내주는 성능을 갖췄지만 학습에 필요한 데이터 확보에도, 작동에 필요한 전력 확보에도 모두 어마어마한 비용을 쓴다. 딥시크가 활용해 효용을 입증한 증류 모델은 이 비용 투자를 무력화한다.\n증류니까 증류주에 비교해 보자. 증류식 소주 한 병을 제대로 만들려면 논을 사서, 볍씨를 뿌리고, 쌀을 수확한 뒤, 발효시켜 찌꺼기를 가라앉히고, 청주를 만들어 이 청주를 또 증류해야 한다. ChatGPT 같은 새로운 AI들은 논을 사서 쌀을 수확하고, 청주를 빚어 소주를 증류하는 모든 과정을 직접 진행한다. 그런데 누군가 이 과정을 건너뛰고 ChatGPT 양조장에서 청주만 훔쳐내어 소주를 빚는다면?\n이게 지금 투자자들을 패닉에 빠뜨린 이유다. 현실의 양조장이라면 도난방지 등의 물리적 억제로 청주를 지킬 수 있지만, AI는 상대가 누구라도 질문을 던지면 답변을 제공한다. 물리적 억제가 의미없다는 뜻이다. 상황이 이런데 엔비디아칩과 데이터센터, 발전소 건설에 수십조를 투자하는 게 과연 의미가 있을까? 군비 경쟁 시기였다면 내가 만들어 쌓아놓은 무기가 후발주자와의 격차를 늘리는 투자였다. AI 경쟁 시기에는 내가 만들어 쌓아놓은 인프라가 후발주자의 무임승차에 사용되는 낭비가 되고 있는지도 모른다. 투자자들의 심리가 순간적으로 얼어붙은 이유다.",

It is reactive because Intent observes the User, Model observes the Intent, View observes the Model, and the User observes the View. It is functional because each of these components is expressed as a referentially transparent function over streams. It follows the original MVC purpose because View and Intent bridge the gap between the user and the digital model, each in one direction.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>위를 번역하면 아래와 같은데,</p>\n\n<div

뷰를 관찰하기 때문에 반응형입니다. 이러한 각 구성 요소는 스트림을 통해 참조적으로 투명한 함수로 표현되므로 기능적입니다. 뷰와 인텐트는 각각 한 방향으로 사용자와 디지털 모델 사이의 간극을 메우기 때문에 원래의 MVC 목적에 부합합니다.\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>핵심은 reactive, functional, MVC의

/></p>\n\n<h2>MVI인가 안드로이드 아키텍처인가?</h2>\n\n<p>제 생각에는 크게 보면 MVI와 Android 아키텍처는 크게 다르지 않다고 생각한다.</p>\n\n<p>Android 아키텍처도 리액트의 UiState 개념을 포함하고 있으며, 이미 오래전부터 RxJava, LiveData, Flow 같은 리액트 개념을 가져와서 사용하고 있었다. 동적으로 데이터 흐름을 받고, 이걸 업데이트하는 부분을 구독 형태로 사용했죠.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 남는 것은 무엇일까? 좀 더 쉽게 쓸 수 있는 부분을 추가하면 어떨까?</p>\n\n<p>그전에 ViewModel에 이벤트를 전달할 때 어떻게 하는지 살펴보는 것이 좋을 것 같다.</p>\n\n<p><br /></p>\n\n<h2>Action</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>내용 수정</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Action은 View에서 ViewModel로 이벤트를 전달하는 데 사용되는 개념이다. MVI 패턴에서는 Intent가 Action과 유사한 역할을 한다.</p>\n\n<p>이후 데이터 흐름은 Action을 받고, ViewModel은 Action에 따라 UiState를 업데이트할 수 있다. View는 업데이트된 UiState를 사용하여 화면을 그린다.</p>\n\n<p>반대로 ViewModel에서 발생한 이벤트를 Effect를 통해 View에 전달하는데 사용한다. Effect는 Toast 메시지 표시, 화면 이동 등과 같은 일회성 이벤트를 나타낸다.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">@Composable</code> 함수에서 onClick을 처리하는 방법에 대해 크게 3가지로 나눠 설명해 본다.</p>\n\n<h4>1. Higher-order function을 파라미터로 받아서 호출하는 방식</h4>\n\n<p>제일 흔하게 쓰는 방법 중 하나이다. 이 방식을 버릴 수는 없다.

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 최근 유행하는 MVI (Model-View-Intent) 패턴과는 다른, 리액트의 Reducer, UiState, Effect, Action 개념을 포함하는 T Composable Architecture를 소개하는 글의 첫 번째 편입니다.\nTComposableArchitecture - 링크\n2부 예고: Alert/Snackbar(Toast)의 로직 처리를 위한 고민\nT는 글쓴이 이름의 첫 글자이며, 나머지는 Compose와 Architecture를 의미합니다.\nCompose에서는 MVI가 가장 적합하다는 의견이 많지만, MVI를 소개하는 cycle.js.org에서는 다음과 같이 설명합니다.\ncycle.js.org - Model-View-Intent - 링크\n\nModel-View-Intent (MVI) is reactive, functional, and follows the core idea in MVC. It is reactive because Intent observes the User, Model observes the Intent, View observes the Model, and the User observes the View. It is functional because each of these components is expressed as a referentially transparent function over streams. It follows the original MVC purpose because View and Intent bridge the gap between the user and the digital model, each in one direction.\n\n\n위를 번역하면 아래와 같은데,\n\n모델-뷰-인텐트(MVI)는 반응적이고 기능적이며 MVC의 핵심 아이디어를 따릅니다. 인텐트가 사용자를 관찰하고, 모델이 인텐트를 관찰하고, 뷰가 모델을 관찰하고, 사용자가 뷰를 관찰하기 때문에 반응형입니다. 이러한 각 구성 요소는 스트림을 통해 참조적으로 투명한 함수로 표현되므로 기능적입니다. 뷰와 인텐트는 각각 한 방향으로 사용자와 디지털 모델 사이의 간극을 메우기 때문에 원래의 MVC 목적에 부합합니다.\n\n\n핵심은 reactive, functional, MVC의 융합입니다. 지금 우리가 사용하는 MVI 패턴과는 다른 부분이 있는데, reactive와 functional은 같고 MVVM을 포함해서 UDF(단방향 데이터 흐름)가 더 적합하다고 보는 것이 좋아보인다.\n이 글에서는\n필자가 생각하는 Composable 구조는?\n아키텍처 이해는?\n아키텍처를 이해하는 데 필요한 부분은 UDF(Unidirectional Data Flow, 단방향 데이터 흐름)를 통해 설명하는 것이 가장 좋다. 여기서 실질적인 데이터 흐름을 관찰하고 능동적으로 변화하는지 여부가 리액트의 핵심 개념이다.\n데이터 흐름(Data flow)을 이해해 보는 데 있어 필요한 것은? 짝퉁 개발자처럼 논하기\n일반적인 Android 아키텍처에서의 데이터 흐름을 표현하면 아래와 같다.\n\n현재는 UiState를 포함하는데, 이 또한 리액트의 개념 중 하나이다.\n\n데이터 흐름 표현한 코드\n위 도식에 대한 코드를 작성하며 설명해보겠다\nRepository 부분\n그림과 반대로 Repository 코드부터 작성해야 어느 부분이 구독을 일으켜 반응적으로 업데이트되는지 이해할 수 있다.\n\nclass SomeRepository(private val someApi: SomeApi) {\n\n  suspend fun loadData(): DataEntity =\n    someApi.load()\n}\n\n\nViewModel 부분\n이 부분에서는 호출이 일어나고, 코루틴 blocking으로 응답을 처리한다. 응답 결과를 반응적으로 받는 것이 아니라 즉시 호출하고 즉시 반환받는다는 점이 중요하다.\n\nclass SomeViewModel(private val someRepository: SomeRepository) {\n\n  private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(SomeUiState())\n  val uiState = _uiState.asStateFlow()\n\n  fun load() = viewModelScope.launch {\n    val data = someRepository.loadData() // 여기까진 일반적인 호출\n    // 여기부터 반응형을 위한 stateFlow 관리\n    _uiState.value = data.convert() // convert 후 _uiState에 갱신\n  }\n}\n\n\nViewModel에 Effect를 추가하여 reducer 처럼 사용한다면\n현재는 반응형 코드 형태로 StateFlow를 사용하고 있다. 여기에 MVI의 Effect를 추가하면 아래와 같이 변경해야 한다.\n\nsealed interface Effect {\n  data object Load : Effect\n}\n\n\nEffect를 받아서 처리하도록 수정하면:\n\nclass SomeViewModel(private val someRepository: SomeRepository) {\n\n  private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(SomeUiState())\n  val uiState = _uiState.asStateFlow()\n\n  fun reduce(effect: Effect) = viewModelScope.launch {\n    when (effect) {\n      is Effect.Load -> {\n        val data = someRepository.loadData() // 여기까진 일반적인 호출\n        // 여기부터 반응형을 위한 stateFlow 관리\n        _uiState.value = data.convert() // convert 후 _uiState에 갱신\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n이 코드는 간단하게 작성되었고, 사용하는 MVI 라이브러리에 따라 다를 수 있다. 마지막에 UiState를 반환하고 BaseReducer로 전달하는 작업을 하는 라이브러리도 있지만, 여기서는 생략했다.\nView 부분\n마지막으로 View 부분이다.\n\n@Composable\nfun ContentView(\n  someViewModel: SomeViewModel = viewModels(),\n) {\n  val uiState by someViewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()\n\n  Column {\n    Button(\n      onClick = {\n        someViewModel.reduce(Effect.Load), // 새로운 데이터 업데이트\n      }\n    ) {\n      Text(\n        text = \"Button\",\n      )\n    }\n\n    Text(\n      text = uiState.text, // UiState에 따라 갱신\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n이 코드를 도식화한 부분이 위에서 본 그림에 해당한다.\n\n\nMVI인가 안드로이드 아키텍처인가?\n제 생각에는 크게 보면 MVI와 Android 아키텍처는 크게 다르지 않다고 생각한다.\nAndroid 아키텍처도 리액트의 UiState 개념을 포함하고 있으며, 이미 오래전부터 RxJava, LiveData, Flow 같은 리액트 개념을 가져와서 사용하고 있었다. 동적으로 데이터 흐름을 받고, 이걸 업데이트하는 부분을 구독 형태로 사용했죠.\n그럼 남는 것은 무엇일까? 좀 더 쉽게 쓸 수 있는 부분을 추가하면 어떨까?\n그전에 ViewModel에 이벤트를 전달할 때 어떻게 하는지 살펴보는 것이 좋을 것 같다.\n\nAction\n내용 수정\nAction은 View에서 ViewModel로 이벤트를 전달하는 데 사용되는 개념이다. MVI 패턴에서는 Intent가 Action과 유사한 역할을 한다.\n이후 데이터 흐름은 Action을 받고, ViewModel은 Action에 따라 UiState를 업데이트할 수 있다. View는 업데이트된 UiState를 사용하여 화면을 그린다.\n반대로 ViewModel에서 발생한 이벤트를 Effect를 통해 View에 전달하는데 사용한다. Effect는 Toast 메시지 표시, 화면 이동 등과 같은 일회성 이벤트를 나타낸다.\n그럼 @Composable 함수에서 onClick을 처리하는 방법에 대해 크게 3가지로 나눠 설명해 본다.\n1. Higher-order function을 파라미터로 받아서 호출하는 방식\n제일 흔하게 쓰는 방법 중 하나이다. 이 방식을 버릴 수는 없다. Action을 지정할 수는 없으니까 공통 컴포넌트를 만들거나 재사용해야 하는 Component를 만들 때 이 방식은 필수이다.\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeItem(\n  onClick: () -> Unit,\n) {\n  Surface(\n    onClick = onClick,\n  ) {\n    // 생략\n  }\n}\n\n\n하지만 이 방식은 ViewModel이 있는 곳까지 끌어올려 체이닝시켜야 한다는 단점이 있다. 그렇다고 안 할 수도 없고, ViewModel을 모든 곳에 주입할 수도 없다.\n2. ViewModel 같은 호출 함수를 직접 파라미터로 전달해서 호출하는 방법\n1번 방법에서 Screen을 만나면 ViewModel을 쓸 수 있는데, 이 부분에서 Higher-order function을 실질적인 함수 호출할 수 있다.\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeScreen(\n  viewModel: SomeViewModel = viewModels(),\n) {\n  Surface(\n    onClick = {\n      viewModel.some()\n    },\n  ) {\n    // 생략\n  }\n}\n\n\n여기서 주의할 점은 Stateless와 Stateful로 함수를 잘 구분해서 작성해야 Preview에 좋다는 것인데, 무작정 Stateful로 작성하면 Preview가 어려워진다.\nStateful versus stateless - 공식 문서 링크\n3-1. UiState에 Higher-order 정의를 넘겨주고 호출하는 방식\nEffect를 모른다면 이 방식도 선택할 수 있을것 같다. 어떤 함수를 불러야 할지 모른다면.\n\ndata class SomeUiState(\n  val onClick: () -> Unit,\n)\n\n\nItem을 사용하면 viewModel을 알지 않더라도 바로 불러줄 수 있는 장점이 생긴다.\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeView(\n  someUiState: SomeUiState,\n) {\n  Surface(\n    onClick = {\n      someUiState.onClick()\n    },\n  ) {\n    // 생략\n  }\n}\n\n\n3-2. UiState에 Action(Effect) 정보를 넘겨주고 호출하는 방식\n이번엔 Effect를 정의하고, 이를 활용한다면 어떨까?\n\nsealed interface Effect {\n  data object Some : Effect\n}\n\ndata class SomeUiState(\n  val effect: Effect,\n)\n\n\n이 방식에서는 결국 viewModel을 알아야 호출할 수 있다는 점이다.\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeScreen(\n  someUiState: SomeUiState,\n  viewModel: SomeViewModel = viewModels(),\n) {\n  Surface(\n    onClick = {\n      viewModel.onEffect(someUiState.effect)\n    },\n  ) {\n    // 생략\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n이 같은 방식은\n위에서 나열한 4가지 방식은 필자가 생각나는 대로 적은 것이다.\n1, 2, 3-2 방식은 viewModel을 결국 @Composable에서 알아야 한다는 단점이 생기고, 여기 까지 끌고 오기 위해선 Higher-order function을 계속 넘겨줘야 한다는 부분도 생긴다.\n결국 Higher-order function을 계속 넘겨주는 것도 나쁜 건 아니지만 많아지면 관리할 부분이 많다는 점이 생긴다.\n그렇다고 3-1번의 방식을 선택하는 것은 좋은 선택지는 아니라고 보는데, 고민이 필요하지만 개발 편의성에서는 최고의 선택일 듯 하다.\n\nT Composable Architecture\n필자가 작업한 T Composable Architecture는 과거에 작성한 글에서도 이야기했던 부분에 해당한다.\nAndroid view에서 ViewModel을 어떻게 호출해 사용해 볼 수 있을까?\nAndroid view에서 ViewModel을 호출했는데, UnitTest는 어떻게 할까?\n이 글에서도 이미 소개했던 방식을 Compose 전용으로 라이브러리화하여 배포했다.\n여기선 용어도 수정하였고, 형태도 변경시켰다.\nAction : Effect, MVI에서 말하는 Intent와 동일할 수 있다. view에서는 Action을 발생 시킨다.\nreducer : ViewModel에서 View에서 발생한 Action을 받아 처리하는 부분이다. MVI 코드에서는 Intent를 reducer로 처리하는 것과 동일하다.\n    \n다만 마지막에 Action은 다음 Action을 지정할 수 있다.\n이 방식은 Swift-composable architecture - 링크에서 영감 받은 부분이다.\n나머지는 코드 부분에 대한 부분이고, 이 글에서 알아야 할 부분은 위와 같이 2가지이다.\n\nT Composable Architecture 활용하기\n활용하기 전에 전체 sequence를 그려보았는데, flow 1과 flow 2로 나눠질 수 있다. Repository에서 이벤트 처리 후 UiState를 갱신할 수도 있고, SideEffect를 처리 할 수도 있다.\n\n전체 샘플 코드는 아래 링크를 참고하길\nSample code - link\n디펜던시 정의\n\nimplementation(\"tech.thdev:composable-architecture-system:latestversion\")\n\n\nAction 정의\nAction을 정의하는데, CaAction을 상속받아 구현한다.\n\nsealed interface Action : CaAction {\n    \n    data object Task : Action // Use object for simple actions\n    \n    data object LoadData : Action // Use object for simple actions\n}\n\n\nSideEffect 정의\n여기서는 SideEffect란 용어를 사용하였다. CaSideEffect를 상속 받아 구현한다.\n\nsealed interface SideEffect : CaSideEffect {\n    \n    data object ShowToast : SideEffect // Use object for simple side effects\n}\n\n\nViewModel 정의\nHilt를 사용하여 아래와 같이 사용할 ViewModel을 지정한다.\n여기서는 reducer()를 상속받아 정의한다.\n\n@HiltViewModel\nclass MainViewModel @Inject constructor(\n    flowCaActionStream: FlowCaActionStream,\n) : CaViewModel<Action, SideEffect>(flowCaActionStream, Action::class) {\n\n  private val _uiState = MutableStateFlow(UiState())\n  val state = _uiState.asStateFlow()\n\n  override suspend fun reducer(action: Action): CaAction =\n      when (action) {\n          is Action.Task -> {\n            _uiState.value = UiState(showPlaceholder = true)\n            Action.LoadData // next event\n          }\n\n          is Action.LoadData -> {\n              val loadEnd = // load network\n              _uiState.value = UiState(text = loadEnd)\n\n              sendSideEffect(SideEffect.ShowToast)\n\n              CaActionNone // Or return another action\n          }\n          // ... other actions\n      }\n}\n\n\nActivity에서 사용하는 경우\n마지막으로 Activity에서는 아래와 같이 동작시켜줘야 한다.\n\n@AndroidEntryPoint\nclass MainActivity : CaActionActivity() {\n\n    private val mainViewModel by viewModels<MainViewModel>()\n\n    @Composable\n    override fun ContentView() {\n        TComposableArchitectureTheme {\n            val action = LocalActionOwner.current\n\n            Column {\n              Button(\n                onClick = action.send(Action.LoadData),\n              ) {\n                Text(\n                  text = \"OnClick\",\n                )\n              }\n\n              Text(\n                text = uiState.text,\n              )\n            }\n\n            LaunchedEffect(Unit) {\n                mainViewModel.loadAction() // Required: Load actions\n                mainViewModel.action(Action.Task) // Option task\n            }\n\n            mainViewModel.sideEffect.collectAsEvent { // Optional: Handle side effects\n                when (it) {\n                    SideEffect.ShowToast -> {\n                        Toast.makeText(this@MainActivity, \"message\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\n                    }\n                    // ... other side effects\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nComposable에서 활용하는 경우\n만약 Composable에서 이를 활용한다고 하면\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeScreen(\n  mainViewModel: MainViewModel = viewModels(),\n) {\n  val uiState by mainViewModel.uiState.collectAsStateWithLifecycle()\n\n  SomeScreen(\n    uiState = uiState,\n  )\n\n  LaunchedEffect(Unit) {\n      mainViewModel.loadAction() // Required: Load actions\n      mainViewModel.action(Action.Task) // Option task\n  }\n}\n\n@Composable\nfun SomeScreen(\n  uiState: UiState,\n) {\n  val action = LocalActionOwner.current\n\n  Column {\n    Button(\n      onClick = action.send(Action.LoadData),\n    ) {\n      Text(\n        text = \"OnClick\",\n      )\n    }\n\n    Text(\n      text = uiState.text,\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n\n구현할 부분에서는 loadAction을 호출을 LaunchEffect()에 따라 생성하도록 강제하였다.\n\nLocalActionOwner의 활용은?\n이 코드는 크게 Action을 처리하기 위한 내부 구현체가 하나 있다. 나머진 일반적인 MVVM + 리엑트, UiState 처리와 동일하다.\nLocalActionOwner.current를 사용하였을때의 장점은 무엇일까?\nviewModel, Higher-order function을 파라메터로 매번 넘길 필요없이 사용할 위치에서 즉시 LocalActionOwner.current를 사용하여 액션을 전달할 수 있다.\n이 하나만으로도 개발에서 귀찮은 보일러플레이트 코드를 줄일 수 있을 거라고 생각한다.\n다행히도 LocalActionOwner.current를 포함해도 Preview에 영향 받지 않는다는 점이다.\n\nAction에서 Next 활용은?\n그리고 앞서 언급하였듯 reducer에서는 next Action을 정의하도록 구현하였다.\nfilter하여 현재 Screen에서 발생한 이벤트만을 감지할 수 있다.\n    \n내가 가진 화면에서의 Action 만을 처리한다. 만약 필요하면 상위에서 정의한 Action을 넘겨야 한다.\n        \n보통 그럴일이 잘 없긴하다.\nViewModel에서 이벤트를 처리하고나서도 다른 액션을 또 처리해야할 때가 있다. A 액션이 끝나면 B 액션을 처리해야 하는 경우가 꼭 생긴다. 이런 부분을 어떻게 할까하다가 TCA에서 활용하는 방식으로 리턴 시켰다.\n    \n이 부분은 MVI에서 UiState를 리턴시키는것과는 매우 다른 부분이다.\n리턴 시킨 Aciton이 다음 이벤트 어떤 걸 처리할지를 지정할 수 있도록 하였는데, 이런 장점으로 인해 A가 끝나면 B로 이벤트를 전달하여 처리할 수 있다.\n함수 다시 부르면 되는 것도 있겠지만 Stream 상에서의 다음 이벤트를 또 이어주기가 쉽진 않아 이 방식으로 구현하도록 해두었다.\n\n주요 코드\n주요 코드는 다음과 같다.\nInternalCaAction을 @Singleton으로 작성했다는 점이 특징이다. 앱 내에 단 하나만 존재할 수 있다.\nSharedFlow를 활용하여 여러 view에서 동일한 이벤트를 하나로 통합했지만, 어디에서나 접근 가능하다는 단점이 있다. 반대로 어디서든 보낼 수 있다는 장점이 있다.\n\n@Singleton\nclass InternalCaAction @Inject constructor() : FlowCaActionStream, CaActionSender {\n\n    private val flowCaAction = MutableSharedFlow<CaAction>(\n        extraBufferCapacity = 1,\n        onBufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST,\n    )\n\n    override fun flowAction(): Flow<CaAction> =\n        flowCaAction.asSharedFlow()\n            .filter { it != CaActionNone }\n\n    override fun send(action: CaAction) {\n        flowCaAction.tryEmit(action)\n    }\n\n    override fun nextAction(action: CaAction) {\n        send(action)\n    }\n}\n\n\n이 문제를 해결하기 위해 CaViewModel에 필터링 코드를 추가했다.\nabstract class CaViewModel<ACTION : CaAction, SIDE_EFFECT : CaSideEffect>(\n    flowCaActionStream: FlowCaActionStream,\n    actionClass: KClass<ACTION>,\n) : ViewModel() {\n\n    @VisibleForTesting\n    val flowAction by lazy(LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE) {\n        flowCaActionStream.flowAction()\n            .filterIsInstance(actionClass) // filter\n            .map {\n                reducer(action = it)\n            }\n            .onEach {\n                flowCaActionStream.nextAction(it)\n            }\n    }\n}\n\n이제 작성한 screen을 벗어나는 일은 발생하지 않는다.\n\nCompose에서 활용하기 위한 중요 코드\n액티비티 기준으로 매번 갱신할 이유가 없어 staticCompositionLocalOf를 사용하였다. 영향 범위에 대한 글은 이전에 웹뷰 작성하면서 언급했기에 여기서는 언급하지 않는다.\nCompose Navigation - WebView Recomposition 해결? - 링크\n\nobject LocalCaActionSenderOwner {\n\n    private val LocalComposition = staticCompositionLocalOf<CaActionSender?> { null }\n\n    val current: CaActionSender?\n        @Composable\n        get() = LocalComposition.current\n\n    infix fun provides(registerOwner: CaActionSender): ProvidedValue<CaActionSender?> =\n        LocalComposition provides registerOwner\n}\n\n\nprovides를 시켜두고, 이를 지속해서 활용하는 형태로 만들었다.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider(\n    LocalCaActionSenderOwner provides caActionSender,\n) {\n    ContentView()\n}\n\n\n사용할 때는\n\nval action = LocalActionOwner.current\n\nButton(\n  onClick = action.send(Action.Some)\n) {}\n\n\n이로 인해 파라미터 전달 이유도 사라지고, 필요한 부분에 LocalActionOwner.current를 호출하여 사용할 수 있다.\n\n다음 작업은\n다음 작업은 Alert/Toast/Snackbar를 Action을 활용해 처리하는 방법을 소개할 예정이다. UI 커스터마이징이 가능하도록 설계가 필요하며, Action으로 처리할지 별도로 분리할지 결정해야 한다.\n이 부분에 대한 고민은 다음 글에서 다루도록 하겠다.\n\n마무리\nSlack의 Circuit - 링크을 사용하는 것도 좋은 방법 중 하나이지만, 직접 구현한 이유는 어렵지 않다고 생각했기 때문이다.\n데이터 흐름이 중요한 부분이라 어려울 부분은 없다고 생각하지만, 개념만 가지고 만든 부분이라 정확하지 않을 수 있다.\n이전에 작성한 Swift-composable architecture - 링크에서 영감을 받아 만든 라이브러리라고 생각하는 것이 편할 것 같다.\niOS TCA 살펴보기 - 링크",

모든 플레이어가 네트워크 효과를 활용하는 시장에서 제품은 어떻게 경쟁해야 할까요?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트. 책 제목만 보면 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;시작이 어렵다&lt;/code&gt;는 느낌이 든다. 이는 맞는 말이다. 그런데 “시작” 중에서도 사용자 간 연결을 기반으로 한 제품을 만들려 할 때 겪게 될 어려움에 대해 이야기하는 책이다. 스타트업 팀이든 누군가 제품을 만들 때 겪게 될 이런 어려움과 해결 방법들에 대해서 사례 기반으로 알려준다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;저자인 앤드류 첸(Andrew Chen)에 대해서도 알아두면 좋은데(워낙 유명한 분이라..), a16z(Andreessen Horowitz)에서 파트너로 활동하며 소셜, 마켓플레이스, 엔터테인먼트, 게임, AI 등 기술 산업 분야에 투자하고 있다. 앤드류가 운영하고 있는 뉴스레터는 20만 명 이상의 구독자가 있다고… 이 책에는 흔히 들어봤을 성공한 스타트업들 이야기가 굉장히 많이 나오는데, 그중에서도 Uber 이야기가 가장 많이 나온다. 앤드류 첸은 이전에 Uber에서 라이더 그로스 부분의 총 책임자(Head of Rider Growth)로 재직하며 플랫폼의 활성 사용자 수를 1,500만에서 1억 명까지 성장시키는데 기여했다. 앤드류 첸 본인의 성공과 실패 경험, 그리고 스타트업들의 유스케이스를 분석해서 다양한 제품과 산업에 적용할 수 있는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 이론&lt;/code&gt; 이라는 프레임워크와 원칙을 만들었고, 그 중에서도 네트워크 효과를 활용하는 제품이 왜 그토록 중요한지 이야기해주고 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;네트워크-효과-network-effects&quot;&gt;네트워크 효과 Network Effects&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;네트워크를 사용하는 사람들이 늘어날수록 네트워크가 사용자들에게 더 가치 있어진다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;네트워크 효과(Network Effects)&lt;/strong&gt;는 제품을 사용하는 사람들이 늘어날수록 제품의 가치가 높아지고, 네트워크가 사용자들에게 더 가치 있어진다고 설명할 때 쓰는 용어다. 이 문장만 봐서는 정확히 무슨 말인지 잘 모르겠다. 어떤 제품을 만드는 메이커 입장에서 네트워크란 무엇일까? 이를 사용자와 연관 지어 생각해 보면, 이런 답을 도출해 볼 수 있다. &lt;strong&gt;연결된 사용자 간의 상호 작용&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;우리가 사용하는 많은 제품이나 서비스는 플랫폼 내 다른 사용자들과의 연결을 통해 가치를 만들어낸다. 예를 들어, Uber는 특정 도시에 운행할 기사와 승객을 연결해 주고, Airbnb는 특정 도시에 방을 제공할 호스트와 여행자를 연결해 준다. 이러한 제품에서는 네트워크 효과가 제품의 가치를 만들어낸다. 그래서 Uber에 특정 도시에 운행할 기사가 없으면 승객 입장에서는 제품이 쓸모없어지고, 이탈로 이어진다. 마찬가지로, Airbnb에 특정 도시에 방을 제공할 호스트가 없으면 사용자 입장에서는 아무리 제품을 잘 만들었더라도 가치가 떨어지고 만다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;네트워크 효과는 이 책의 처음부터 끝까지 빠지지 않고 등장하는 중요한 개념이다. 책의 제목인 Cold Start는 단어가 270번 나오는 것에 비해, Network Effect는 총 301번 등장한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;제품을 만드는 사람들에게 네트워크 효과가 왜 중요할까? 정답은 &lt;strong&gt;쉬워진 제품 출시와 치열한 경쟁 속에서 살아남기 위한 차별화&lt;/strong&gt;에 있다. 이제 AI 도구를 사용하지 않으면 바보가 되는 세상이 되었다. 간단한 프로토타이핑은 기본이고, 상용 제품도 Bolt, v0, Replit 같은 도구를 활용하면 쉽게 만들 수 있다. 또한, 잘 만들어진 SaaS, No Code(Low Code) 툴이 너무 많고, 클라우드 환경도 날이 갈수록 발전하고 있어 제품을 만드는 팀 입장에서는 제품 출시의 벽이 정말 낮아졌다. 그래서 이제는 제품 성공에서 속도가 중요한 시대는 지난 것 같다. 제품 출시는 쉬워졌고, 경쟁은 갈수록 치열해지고 있다. 그렇기 때문에 경쟁 제품으로부터 방어할 수 있는 차별화된 네트워크를 구축하는 것이 중요하다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;대부분의 새로운 제품은 첫 시장 진입에 실패하고 사라진다. 그리고 그들의 네트워크는 시작도 하기 전에 붕괴하고 만다. 네트워크 효과가 모두 강력하고 긍정적인 힘이라는 것은 근거 없는 믿음이며, 사실은 정반대다. 아래에서도 나오지만, 작은 규모의 네트워크는 자연적으로 자신을 파괴하려고 한다. 사람들이 어떤 제품을 보러 갔을 때, 그것을 사용하고 있는 지인이나 동료가 아무도 없다면 자연스럽게 떠나고 말 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 문제를 어떻게 해결할 수 있을까? 다음 장에서 살펴볼 원자 네트워크(충분히 사람이 떠나지 않을 만큼의 최소한의 네트워크)가 답이 될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;콜드-스타트-이론-cold-start-theory&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 이론 Cold Start Theory&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)은 모든 제품을 만드는 팀이 네트워크 효과를 온전히 활용하기 위해 거쳐야 할 일련의 단계를 프레임워크로 정리한 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/stages-cold-start-framework.png&quot; alt=&quot;The stages of the Cold Start framework&quot; title=&quot;The stages of the Cold Start framework&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;콜드-스타트-문제-the-cold-start-problem&quot;&gt;콜드 스타트 문제 The Cold Start Problem:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;새로운 영상 공유 앱이 출시되었다. 그런데 앱에 다양한 콘텐츠가 없다 보니 사용자들은 오래 머물지 않는다. 마켓플레이스와 소셜 네트워크 등을 포함하여 B2B 서비스도 마찬가지다. 사용자가 자신이 원하는 사람이나 물건을 찾지 못하면 서비스에서 이탈한다. 이것이 바로 콜드 스타트 문제(The Cold Start Problem)이며, 초기 이탈 문제를 해결하기 위해 적절한 사용자와 콘텐츠를 동일한 네트워크에 동시에 모으는 것이 필수적이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Anti-network effects; the network effects that startups love so much actually hurt them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 문장이 인상 깊었는데, 대부분의 경우 스타트업들이 그토록 사랑하는 네트워크 효과는 실제로 그들에게 해가 된다고 한다. 제품에 네트워크를 구축해야 살아남는 세계에서, 제대로 된 네트워크가 없으면 이는 자기 파괴적인 관계로 돌아선다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;누구나 거쳐가야 할 초기 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하기 위해 Wikipedia의 콘텐츠 제작자, 신용카드의 발명 과정, Zoom의 제품 출시 과정 이야기가 자세하게 소개되었다. 여기서 강조된 개념이 &lt;strong&gt;원자 네트워크(Atomic Network)&lt;/strong&gt; 였는데, &lt;strong&gt;최소한의 규모로도 안정적으로 작동하고 스스로 성장할 수 있는 네트워크&lt;/strong&gt;를 의미한다. 예를 들어, Zoom의 화상회의 서비스는 단 2명의 사용자만으로도 작동할 수 있지만, Airbnb는 하나의 시장에 수백 개의 활성화된 숙소 리스트가 있어야 안정적인 네트워크가 형성된다. 그래서 이 단계에 있는 팀이나 제품에게는 우리 제품의 Atomic Network가 무엇인지(임계치가 얼마인지) 파악하는게 중요하다. 여기서 중요한 것 중 하나는 Atomic Network는 규모가 크지 않고 밀도가 높아야 한다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;가장 규모가 작은 집단을 구축하는 것을 목표로 해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;더 많은 사용자를 포함 시키려 할수록 원자 네트워크를 만드는 것은 어려워진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;콜드 스타트 문제에 있어 원자 네트워크 보다 중요한 개념이 있다. 네트워크는 종종 쌍을 이룬 측면을 가지고 있다. Provider ↔ Consumer, Content Creator ↔ Consumer, Driver ↔ Passenger, Male ↔ Female 처럼 말이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, Uber에서는 운전 기사가 있어야 승객이 있고, Tinder에서는 여성 사용자가 있어야 남성 사용자가 있다. 이처럼 초기 원자 네트워크에는 특정한 역학 관계가 작용한다. 또한, 소수의 사용자가 지나치게 많은 가치를 창출하면서 강력한 권력을 차지하게 되는 현상도 발생할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Uber: 상위 20% 드라이버가 전체 60% 승객을 태운다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Tinder: 여성은 5%의 남성을 선택하지만 평균 남성은 45% 여성을 선택한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Wikipedia: 전체 사용자는 수억명, 월 활성 작성자가 10만명이지만, 100건 이상 글 편집자는 4,000명(0.02%). Steven Pruitt 라는 한 개인은 영문 위키피디아의 1/3을 작성함(35,000개 글, 300만번 이상 수정).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크 내의 유저는 보통 한 쪽이 다른 한 쪽보다 데려오기 어렵다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;소셜 네트워크: 모두가 소비하는 미디어를 만드는 콘텐츠 창작자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;앱스토어: 제품을 제작하는 개발자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;업무용 앱: 문서와 프로젝트를 작성하고 제작하며 동료들을 불러 모으는 관리자&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그리고 이걸 네트워크의 &lt;strong&gt;하드 사이드(Hard Side)&lt;/strong&gt;라고 부른다. 네트워크의 하드 사이드를 관리하고 이들을 만족시키는 것이 원자 네트워크보다 더 중요하다. 따라서 제품이 네트워크 기반으로 성장 하기를 원한다면, 하드 사이드부터 정의하는 것이 중요하다. Uber 와 Tinder도 마찬가지다. 위키피디아 사례를 보면, 고작 0.02%에 불과한 의욕 넘치는 사용자들이 나머지 네트워크를 위해 콘텐츠를 발행한다. 위키피디아의 콘텐츠 창작자들 역시 커뮤니티 자체에 매료되었을 가능성이 높다. 사회적 반응과 지위 등 커뮤니티의 역학 관계가 그들이 계속 콘텐츠를 발행하도록 동기를 부여하는 요소가 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하드 사이드를 정의하고 원자 네트워크를 구축하다 보면 마법의 순간(Magic Moment)이 온다. 여기서는 클럽하우스를 예시로 들었는데, 네트워크가 충분히 채워지고 활성화되어 사람들이 올바른 방식으로 소통할 수 있다면, 그때 Magic Moment가 온다고 한다. 흔히 Magic Moment를 찾는 과정을 Product-Market Fit을 찾는 과정이라고 한다. 그렇다면 Magic Moment를 어떻게 측정할 수 있을까? 이는 반대로 접근해 보면 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시) 우버 ZERO: 승객이 우버 앱을 실행하여 주소를 선택한 후 승차하기로 했을 때 그 지역에 운전기사가 아무도 없는 상황. 네트워크에 있는 다른 사용자들과 상호작용하는 것이 그 상품의 핵심이라면 제로는 그것이 충족될 수 없다는 의미이며, 이는 사용자가 이탈하여 다시는 돌아오지 않을 수도 있다는 뜻이다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;만약 콜드 스타트 문제를 겪고 있다면, 초기 단계에서는 제품에서 빠진 기능을 인간의 노력으로 대체하는 것도 중요하다. 이 책에서는 이를 플린트스토닝(Flintstoning)이라고 표현한다. 초기 네트워크가 형성되면, 플린트스토닝 기법은 가속도를 얻으며 점점 자동화를 향해 진화한다. 네트워크가 스스로 일어설 수 있을 때까지, 중요한 부분을 수동으로 채워 넣는 것이 목표다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마지막으로 Always Be Hustlin. 2012년, Uber는 앱에 등장하는 ‘ICE CREAM’ 버튼을 누르면 우버 블랙 차량을 통해 아이스크림이 배달되는 이벤트를 진행했다. ‘실제로 도움이 되었나요?’라는 질문에 대한 대답은 이렇다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;개별적인 볼거리로는 회사에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았을 수도 있다. 하지만 시장을 제로에서 티핑 포인트까지 끌어올리는 프레임워크 안에서, 이러한 재빠르고 영리한 전술은 시장이 이륙하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했다고 생각한다. 가장 중요한 것은, 우버가 이런 개념을 빠르게 식별하고 실행하며 반복할 수 있는 시스템을 만들었다는 점이다. 이러한 시스템을 구축하는 데 도움을 준 것은 &lt;strong&gt;진취적인 팀 문화, 강력한 소프트웨어 제작 도구, 그리고 각 도시마다 고유한 콜드 스타트 문제가 있다는 것에 대한 이해&lt;/strong&gt;다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;차량 공유 앱에서 아이스크림을 배달해준다? 이벤트만 보면 서비스 성장에 전혀 영향을 미칠것 같지 않다. 그런데 이런 이벤트들은 Uber 1.0 Cultural Values에 기반한 것이고 이걸 보니 정말 많은 시도를 했겠다는 생각이 들었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make Magic&lt;/strong&gt;: Seek breakthrough that will stand the test of time&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Super pumped&lt;/strong&gt;: The world is a puzzle to be solved with enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inside Out&lt;/strong&gt;: Find the gap between popular perception and reality&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be an Owner, Not a Renter&lt;/strong&gt;: Revolutions are won by true believers&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimistic Leadership&lt;/strong&gt;: Be inspiring&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Yourself&lt;/strong&gt;: Each of us should be authentic&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Bold Bets&lt;/strong&gt;: Take risks and plant seeds that are five to ten years out&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Obsession&lt;/strong&gt;: Start with what’s best for the customer&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Be Hustlin’&lt;/strong&gt;: Get more done with less, working longer, harder, and smarter, not just two out of three&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let Builders Build&lt;/strong&gt;: People must be empowered to build things&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winning&lt;/strong&gt;: Champion’s Mindset&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Principled Confrontation&lt;/strong&gt;: Sometimes the world and institutions need to change in order for the future to be ushered in&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping&lt;/strong&gt;: The best idea always wins.

명씩 찾아가 설득하는 것이 처음 시작할 때는 좋은 방법이라는 의미다. 창립자가 해야 하는 가장 흔한 확장되지 않는 일은 사용자를 직접 선발하는 것이다. 이는 거의 모든 스타트업이 반드시 거쳐야 하는 과정이다. 사용자가 오기를 기다려서는 안 된다. 밖으로 나가 직접 부딪쳐야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;생각해볼만한 재미있는 질문:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 네트워크에 처음부터 있어야 할 가장 중요한 사용자들은 누구이고 그 이유는 무엇인가?&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;원하는 대로 성장할 수 있게 하려면 초기 네트워크의 씨앗을 어떻게 뿌려야 하는가?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;티핑-포인트-the-tipping-point&quot;&gt;티핑 포인트 The Tipping Point:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;원자 네트워크가 잘 구축되어 콜드 스타트 문제를 극복하면, 네트워크는 어느 순간 폭발적인 성장을 맞이하게 된다. 네트워크가 성장하면서 새로운 네트워크들이 형성되는데, 이 과정이 점점 가속화되며 전체 시장을 훨씬 수월하게 공략할 수 있게 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;LinkedIn: 초대 받은 사람만 사용할 수 있게 설계하여 연결을 통한 선순환을 만들어냄&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Instagram: 사진 보정 도구로 시작해서 팔로우와 공유를 통해 네트워크 효과를 만들어냄&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Uber: 특정 도시에서의 성공 경험을 바탕으로 수요와 공급을 맞춰나가는 전략을 계속해서 반복&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크를 론칭할 때마다, 다음 도미노를 쓰러뜨리는 일이 훨씬 수월해진다. 이 모든 것은 처음 시작된 하나의 작은 성공 덕분이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instagram 처럼 도구와 네트워크가 쌍을 이루는 제품:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;창작 + 사람들과 공유: Instagram, Youtube, Google Workspace, LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;구성 + 사람들과 협업: Pinterest, Asana, Dropbox&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기록 체계 + 사람들과 최신 정보 유지: OpenTable, GitHub&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;검색 + 사람들과 함께 기부: Zillow, Glassdoor, Yelp&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;이탈-속도-escape-velocity&quot;&gt;이탈 속도 Escape Velocity:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;신제품이 성공적으로 확장하기 시작하면, 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달했다고 표현한다. 각 네트워크가 어느 정도 자리를 잡기 시작하면, 네트워크 효과를 강화하고 성장을 지속하기 위해 미친 듯이 일에만 집중해야 하는 시기가 바로 이때다. 이 단계의 핵심은 재빠르게 높은 성장률을 유지하면서, 성공적인 제품의 네트워크 효과를 극대화하는 것이다. 그래서 이 시점에는 흔히 하키 스틱 커브(hockey stick curve)가 나타난다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이탈 속도에 대해 설명하면서, 네트워크 효과의 아래 세 가지 핵심 요소도 함께 소개했다. 네트워크 기반 제품은 자신의 사적인 네트워크에 있는 사람들에게 제품을 소개할 수 있는 능력을 지니고 있다. 이 능력 덕분에 획득 비용(Acquisition Cost)은 시간이 지나 시장 포화와 경쟁으로 인해 자연스럽게 상승하는 상황에서도 낮게 유지될 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;획득 효과(Acquisition Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자가 단순히 제품을 사용하면서도 자연스럽게 새로운 사용자를 유입시키는 효과&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;특정 제품의 사용자가 증가하면서, 사람들이 그 제품을 사용하는 시간이 길어지고 관심이 높아질 때 발생하는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;재활성화(Reactivation)는 일반적으로 신제품에는 큰 우려 사항이 아니다(탈퇴하는 사용자가 적기 때문). 따라서 초점은 신규 사용자 확보에 맞춰져야 한다. 그러나 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity) 단계에 도달한 제품이라면, 수백만 명의 사용자 풀을 활용할 수 있다. 기존 사용자를 다시 참여시키는 것은 신규 사용자를 획득하는 것만큼 중요한 성장 레버가 될 수 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;참여 효과(Engagement Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 확장하면서 신규 고객을 끌어들이는 능력, 즉 바이럴 요소(Viral Factor)&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;제품이 더 많은 사용자를 확보할수록 점점 더 사용자 친화적이고 몰입도가 높아지는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;최근에는 리텐션 곡선(Retention Curves)과 참여 지표(Engagement Metrics)를 활용하여 효과를 측정&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;경제 효과(Economic Effect)&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크 효과가 시간이 지남에 따라 비즈니스 모델을 더욱 발전시키는 방식&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 성장하면서 수익화 및 전환율(Conversion Rate)이 향상되는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크 효과가 단순히 사용자 증가뿐만 아니라 비즈니스의 경제적 가치도 향상시킬 수 있는지를 탐구&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시1: 피드 알고리즘 개선, 전환율 증가, 프리미엄 가격 책정(Premium Pricing) 등의 방식으로 수익성 향상&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;예시2: Uber 플랫폼에 운전자가 늘어나면 경쟁 플랫폼에 비해 승객 입장에서의 단가가 낮아지고 그만큼 수요가 즐어나서 수익화와 전환율이 올라간다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;천장-the-ceiling&quot;&gt;천장 The Ceiling:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크가 너무 커지고 포화 상태가 되면, 기존 사용자들은 피로를 느끼고 제품은 성장의 한계에 부딪히게 된다. 이는 네트워크가 최고점에 도달한 후 성장이 교착 상태에 빠지는 현상을 의미한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;여기서 &lt;a href=&quot;https://andrewchen.com/the-law-of-shitty-clickthroughs&quot;&gt;엿 같은 클릭률의 법칙(The Law of Shitty Clickthroughs)&lt;/a&gt;에 대해서 소개했는데 인상 깊었다. 1994년, HotWired 웹사이트에서 최초의 배너 광고가 등장했을 때, 클릭률(CTR)은 무려 78%에 달했다. 그러나 2011년 Facebook에서의 배너 광고 클릭률은 0.05%로, 1500배나 낮아졌다. 이는 단순한 우연이 아니라, 시간이 지남에 따라 모든 마케팅 전략의 클릭률이 감소하는 법칙이 작용한 결과다. 배너 광고뿐만 아니라 이메일, 뉴스레터, 기타 온라인 채널의 성과도 시간이 지나면서 점점 감소한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;클릭률 저하의 주요 원인:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자는 새로움(신선함)에 반응하지만, 이건 금방 사라진다. 새로운 마케팅 기법이 처음 등장하면 사람들은 신기해서 반응하지만, 반복될수록 효과가 급격히 떨어진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;선점 효과는 오래가지 않는다. 만약 당신이 새로운 마케팅 기법을 개발하여 높은 성과를 거둔다면, 경쟁자들은 이걸 빠르게 모방할 것이다. 마케팅 채널이 퍼지면 경쟁으로 인해 성과가 점차 약화된다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;규모가 커질수록 전환율이 낮아진다. 초기 시장(early adaopters)은 새로운 기술이나 제품에 열광하지만, 주류 시장(mainstream market)은 제품이 정말 유용한지를 따진다. 즉, 처음에는 적은 비용으로 높은 효과를 볼 수 있지만, 시간이 지날수록 광고비는 증가하고 전환율은 감소한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;클릭률 저하의 법칙을 극복하는 방법:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;지속적인 개선과 최적화: 새로운 Creative(광고 소재) 테스트, 새로운 퍼블리셔와 광고 네트워크 탐색, 데이터 기반 최적화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;정보 전달형 마케팅 활용: 단순히 “광고”로 접근하는 것이 아니라, 사용자에게 유용한 정보를 제공하는 콘텐츠 마케팅 전략을 활용해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;새로운 마케팅 채널 선점: 아직 경쟁이 치열하지 않은 새로운 마케팅 채널을 먼저 활용하는 것이 중요하다. 남들이 아직 시도하지 않은 마케팅 채널을 개척하면, 높은 성과를 낼 가능성이 크다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 장은 질문과 짧은 답변으로 마무리되었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마케팅 채널을 통해 주당 수백 건의 다운로드가 발생하고 있다면, 다운로드 수를 두 배로 늘리려면 어떻게 해야 할까? 또는 10배, 궁극적으로 1000배 늘리려면? 가장 좋은 방법은 네트워크 효과 여부와 관계없이 꾸준히 새로운 채널을 구축하는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;해자-the-moat&quot;&gt;해자 The Moat:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;성(안정적인 현금 흐름 혹은 이익)이 있으면 그걸 빼앗기 위해 달려드는 적군(경쟁자)이 있고, 그들로부터 방어하기 위해 구덩이를 파고 물을 채워 놓은 것을 해자(Moat)라고 부른다. 경쟁적 해자(Competitive Moat)에 대한 개념은 세계적인 투자자인 Warren Buffett이 인용하면서 유명해졌다. 이 용어는 경쟁 제품에 비해 경쟁 우위를 유지하여 장기적인 수익성과 시장 점유율을 보호할 수 있는 제품의 능력을 의미한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;The key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society, or how much it will grow, but rather determining the competitive advantage of any given company and, above all, the durability of that advantage. The products or services that have wide, sustainable moats around them are the ones that deliver rewards to investors.&lt;br /&gt;\n투자의 핵심은 어떤 산업이 사회에 얼마나 큰 영향을 미칠 것인지 또는 얼마나 성장할 것인지를 평가하는 것이 아닙니다. 오히려 중요한 것은, 개별 기업의 경쟁 우위를 평가하고, 그 경쟁 우위가 얼마나 지속될 수 있는지를 파악하는 것입니다. 넓고 지속 가능한 해자를 가진 제품이나 서비스만이 장기적으로 투자자들에게 높은 보상을 제공할 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/moat.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Moat&quot; title=&quot;The Moat&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 글의 도입부에서도 이야기했던 네트워크 제품의 차별점에 대한 내용이다. &lt;strong&gt;차별화된 네트워크를 갖춘 제품은 경쟁자가 쉽게 진입할 수 없다&lt;/strong&gt;는 점에서 강력한 이점을 가진다. 이 시점부터는 네트워크를 기반으로 한 경쟁이 본격적으로 시작된다. 그리고 경쟁자를 물리치기 위한 네트워크 효과가 발동한다. 재미있는 점은, 여기서 경쟁은 단순히 더 좋은 기능이나 실행력에 관한 것만이 아니라, 한 제품의 생태계가 다른 제품의 생태계를 어떻게 위협하는가에 대한 문제로 확장된다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, Airbnb가 시장에서 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달하면, 콜드 스타트 문제(Cold Start Problem)는 새로운 진입자에 대한 방어책이 된다. 결국, 도시에 진입하는 경쟁 제품은 모두 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하여 동일한 밀도를 구축해야 한다. 여러분이 0에서 티핑 포인트(Tipping Point)까지 가는 데 어려움을 겪었던 것처럼, 불리한 조건에서 시작하는 경쟁 업체에게는 더욱 큰 도전이 될 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;해자(Moat)에 대해 설명하면서 선순환과 악순환(Cycle of Virtue and Doom)에 대한 이야기도 흥미로웠다. 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 따르면, 경쟁은 선순환과 동시에 악순환을 만들어 낸다. &lt;strong&gt;네트워크 효과는 승자에게 강력한 이점을 제공하는 동시에, 패배한 네트워크에는 강력한 부정적인 영향을 미친다. 네트워크의 가치는 사용자가 많아질수록 기하급수적으로 증가하지만, 반대로 사용자가 이탈하면 네트워크의 가치도 기하급수적으로 붕괴한다.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;유저 획득(Acquisition) – 바이럴 성장(viral growth)이 둔화&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자 참여(Engagement) – 사용자 활동 감소&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;경제성(Economics) – 수익화(monitization) 악화&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;즉, 네트워크 효과는 강력한 성장 촉진제지만, 동시에 사용자 이탈이 발생하면 네트워크 전체를 급격히 무너뜨리는 요인이 될 수도 있다는 것이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;재밌었던-이야기들&quot;&gt;재밌었던 이야기들&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;여기까지가 책 전체에 나온 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 대한 정리다. 여기부터는 콜드 스타트 &amp;amp; 네트워크 효과에 대한 흥미로웠던 이야기들을 정리해놓았다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;알리-임계값-allee-threshold&quot;&gt;알리 임계값 Allee Threshold:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;미어캣은 아프리카 남부에 사는 극도로 사회적인 동물로, 보통 서른에서 쉰 마리 정도가 모여 무리를 지어 생활한다. 그 이유는 포식자가 접근하면 무리 중 한 마리가 두 발로 서서 경계를 서고 복잡한 경고음을 내어 다른 개체들에게 위험을 알리기 때문이다. 이들은 포식자가 공중인지 지상인지, 위험도가 낮은지, 중간인지, 높은지에 따라 다양한 방식으로 짖거나 휘파람 소리를 낸다. 이러한 경고 시스템 덕분에 무리는 안전을 유지할 수 있다. 이러한 동물의 집단 행동은 1930년대 시카고 대학교의 생태학자 워더 클라이드 알리(Warder Clyde Allee)에 의해 처음으로 연구되었다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그는 논문 &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400610202&quot;&gt;동물 집단 연구: 금붕어의 콜로이드 은에 대한 집단 보호(Studies in Animal Aggregations: Mass Protection Against Colloidal Silver Among Goldfishes)&lt;/a&gt;를 통해 흥미로운 사실을 발견했다. 그에 따르면, 금붕어는 집단으로 있을 때 더 빠르게 성장하고, 물의 독성을 더 잘 견딜 수 있다. 이러한 개념은 생물학에서 중요한 개념이 되었으며, 집단 크기가 임계점을 넘어야 개체들이 더 안전해지고, 결국 개체군이 더 빠르게 성장할 수 있다는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;알리 임계값(Allee Threshold)&lt;/code&gt; 개념이 탄생했다. 즉, 알리의 인구 성장 곡선은 생태학적 네트워크 효과(Network Effect)와 유사하다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/01/30/allee-threshold.png&quot; alt=&quot;Allee Threshold&quot; title=&quot;Allee Threshold&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;메시징 앱을 사용하는 사람이 적으면, 기존 사용자도 앱을 삭제한다:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자 수가 줄어들면, 네트워크의 가치가 감소 → 점점 더 많은 사람들이 앱을 떠남 → 네트워크 붕괴&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;반면, 건강한 미어캣 무리는 지속적으로 성장하며 새로운 무리를 형성할 가능성이 있다:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;알리 임계값을 넘어서면 개체군은 지속적으로 증가&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;충분한 개체 수가 유지되는 한, 약간의 개체 손실이 있어도 전체 인구는 안정적으로 유지&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하지만 이러한 성장은 영원히 지속될 수 없다. 결국, 환경이 제공할 수 있는 자원의 한계(예: 미어캣이 먹는 곤충과 과일의 양) 때문에 개체군이 어느 정도 이상으로 증가할 수 없다. 이것을 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext

서비스 이탈 → 운전자도 플랫폼 이탈 → 우버 네트워크 붕괴&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;하지만 임계점을 넘어서면, 네트워크가 원활하게 작동한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;운전자가 증가 → 대기 시간이 감소 → 사용자 증가 → 운전자 증가&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그러나 네트워크가 너무 커지면 한계에 도달한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기다림 없이 차량을 이용하는 것은 편리하지만, 운전자가 너무 많으면 오히려 플랫폼 운영이 비효율적&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;즉, &lt;strong&gt;네트워크가 성장하는 데는 적절한 균형점이 필요&lt;/strong&gt;하다. 알리 임계값은 단순한 생태학 개념이 아니라, 기술 제품의 네트워크 효과에도 그대로 적용된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기에는 임계값을 넘을 수 있도록 사용자 확보가 필수적이다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;네트워크가 성장하면 최적의 수용력을 유지해야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;그렇지 않으면 네트워크는 붕괴할 가능성이 크다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;네트워크 기반 제품이 성공하려면, 이러한 생태학적 법칙을 이해하고 적절한 성장 전략을 적용해야 한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;수익성-부족에-대한-이야기&quot;&gt;수익성 부족에 대한 이야기:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;티핑 포인트를 빠르게 거쳐가기 위해 수익이 나지 않는 것이 현명한 이유는 무엇일까? 수익성 부족이 네트워크가 티핑 포인트를 더 빠르게 지나게 하는 현명한 전략이 될 수 있는 이유를 다음과 같이 설명했다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;소수의 원자 네트워크를 구축한 후에는 돈을 지출하여 전체 시장에 진입하고 싶어질 것이다. 마켓플레이스의 경우, 구매자에게는 낮은 가격, 판매자에게는 높은 수익이 핵심적인 가치 제안이 된다. 사회적 제품에서도 마찬가지로, 커뮤니케이션이든 콘텐츠 공유든 중요한 요소가 된다. 여기서 콘텐츠 창작자에게 중요한 것은 청중 확보와 수익 창출 모두다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;일단 시장에서 승리하면, 거의 언제나 규모에 맞게 인센티브를 줄이는 것이 목표가 된다. 플랫폼에서 처리 가능한 전체 시장이 활성화되면, 더 이상 구매 비용에 지출할 필요가 없어진다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;단기간에는 수익이 나지 않을 것 같아도, 시장이 내게 유리한 티핑 포인트에 도달한다면 장기적으로 우위를 점할 수 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;인접-사용자-이론-adjacent-users-theory&quot;&gt;인접 사용자 이론 Adjacent Users Theory:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n

네트워크보다 훨씬 더 활성화되어 있다. 일반적으로, 가장 먼저 형성된 핵심 네트워크(Core Network)가 가장 건강하고 활발하게 작동한다. 그러나 핵심 네트워크에서 멀어질수록 참여도가 낮은 사용자 그룹과 거의 활성화되지 않은 네트워크가 존재하게 된다. 즉, 제품을 인지하고 있으며 테스트해본 경험은 있지만, 여전히 참여형 사용자가 되지 못한 이들이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예를 들어, eBay의 초기 핵심 시장은 미국의 수집품(Collectibles) 커뮤니티였지만, 자동차 같은 고가품을 거래하는 사용자들에게는 적합하지 않았다. 또한, 결제 시스템이 원활하지 않은 국제 시장과 같은 완전히 비활성화된 네트워크도 존재했다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이러한 인접 네트워크(Adjacent Networks)를 이해하고 하나씩 공략하는 것이 성장과 시장 확장의 핵심 전략이다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;책에 나온 Instagram 사례:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었음. 이는 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있음. 당시 Instagram의 VP Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 이유를 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발해 10억 명 이상의 사용자로 확장할 수 있도록 만듦.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만, 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었다. 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;당시 Instagram의 VP of Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 원인을 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발하여 사용자를 10억 명 이상으로 확장할 수 있도록 만들었다. 이 때 그가 접근한 방식은 인접 사용자(Adjacent User)에 대한 분석이었다. 이들이 제품을 정착하지 못한 이유는 현재 제품의 포지셔닝 이나 사용자 경험이 이들에게 적합하지 않기 때문이었다. 4억 명의 기존 사용자들에게는 Product-Market Fit이 있었지만, 수십억 명의 새로운 사용자들은 Instagram을 자신의 삶과 연결하지 못하고 있었음.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 인접 사용자는 미국의 35~45세 여성으로, Facebook은 사용하지만 Instagram의 가치를 이해하지 못하는 그룹. 이들을 위해 Facebook 프로필과 친구 관계 데이터를 활용하여 친구 및 가족을 쉽게 찾을 수 있도록 추천 알고리즘을 개선함.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;후기 인접 사용자는 자카르타에서 저사양 3G 안드로이드폰을 사용하는 예비 사용자. 이들을 위해 낮은 데이터 소비를 지원하는 앱 최적화 작업을 진행함.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Instagram은 총 8개의 주요 인접 사용자 그룹을 단계적으로 해결해 나가면서, 성장 정체를 극복하고 폭발적인 확장을 이루어냄.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;컨텍스트의-붕괴-context-collapse&quot;&gt;컨텍스트의 붕괴 Context Collapse:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;모든 네트워크는 초기에 특정 원자 네트워크(Atomic Network)를 중심으로 형성된다. 이 시기에는 네티켓(Netiquette), 즉 네트워크 내에서 허용되는 행동과 금기사항이 자연스럽게 정해지며, 특정 문화가 형성된다. 그러나 시간이 지나면서 이러한 문화는 점점 약화되기 쉬워지고, 결국 맥락 붕괴(Context Collapse)가 발생한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이러한 컨텍스트 붕괴는 서로 다른 사용자 그룹이 하나의 네트워크에서 충돌할 때 발생한다. 예를 들어, Facebook이 초기에는 친한 친구들끼리 사적인 이야기, 사진, 농담을 공유하는 공간으로 활용되었지만, 시간이 지나면서 친척, 가족, 선생님, 상사까지 유입되었다. 이로 인해 사용자는 콘텐츠를 자유롭게 게시하지 못하게 되고, 활동이 줄어들면서 네트워크 성장에도 부정적인 영향을 미치게 된다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴는 너무나도 많은 네트워크가 동시에 모였을 때 발생한다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴의 문제점:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;콘텐츠 제작자(Content Creators) 감소 → 새로운 콘텐츠 감소 → 네트워크 가치 하락\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: YouTube, Instagram의 크리에이터들이 특정 콘텐츠를 올리기 꺼려하는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;마켓플레이스에서의 매칭(Matchmaking) 저하 → 일반 사용자 유입(퀄리티 저하) → 초기 핵심 유저의 이탈 → 네트워크 가치 하락\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: 고급 스니커 거래 커뮤니티가 시간이 지나면서 일반 신발 판매 시장으로 변질되는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;기업 내 협업 도구에서의 문제\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;초기: 소규모 팀 내에서는 자유로운 소통이 가능&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;변화: 조직이 커지면서 상사, 임원, 외부 팀까지 유입되며 소통 위축&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예시: Slack에서 팀원이 자유롭게 농담을 주고받다가 임원이 참여하면서 분위기가 달라지는 현상&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;컨텍스트 붕괴를 극복하는 방법:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;사용자를 세분화(Segmentation)하여 네트워크 분리\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Facebook: 비공개 그룹(Facebook Groups)

Personalization)\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;사용자가 누구에게 어떤 콘텐츠를 노출할지 선택할 수 있도록 지원&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;예: Twitter의 “Following” vs. “For You” 피드, LinkedIn의 “Private Mode”&lt;/li&gt;\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\n  &lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;초기 사용자 문화 보호\n    &lt;ul&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Airbnb;  “고유한 숙소” 강조하며 호텔과 차별화&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Reddit; 특정 커뮤니티 문화 유지하도록 강력한 모더레이션 정책 운영&lt;/li&gt;\n

&lt;li&gt;대규모 론칭으로 인해 생성된 네트워크가 취약한 이유는 분명하다. 존재하지 않는 다수의 네트워크보다, 밀도가 높고 참여도가 높은 소규모 원자 네트워크가 더 유리하다. 네트워크 제품의 유용성이 다른 사용자의 확보에 달려 있다면, 목표 수치에 집착하기보다 네트워크 내 개별 사용자 간의 관계를 확장하는 것이 더 중요하다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;스타트업은 작은 규모에서 시작하여 네트워크의 힘을 활용해 성장할 수 있는 장점이 있다.&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;거대한 규모의 네트워크 효과를 창출하려면, 우선 작은 규모의 원자 네트워크에서 시작해야 한다. 그리고 첫 번째 네트워크 집합에서의 성공을 발판 삼아, 그다음 네트워크 집합으로 확장해 나가야 한다.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;마치며&quot;&gt;마치며&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;예나 지금이나 스타트업의 성공과 실패 이야기를 들으면 설렘이 가득합니다. 그런데 제품을 만드는 사람으로서, 때로는 엔드 유저로서 네트워크 효과를 가진 서비스를 체험하면서 이 책에서 다루는 내용이 당연하게 느껴지기도 했습니다. 아마도 우리가 이미 경험하고 있는 현상들을 이 책이 체계적으로 정리해주어서 그런것 같습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;각 분야의 전문가들은 특정 문제나 현상을 설명하기 위해 개념에 이름을 붙이곤 합니다. Cold Start Theory, Network Effects, Adjacent Users Theory 등 우리가 이미 알고 있고 경험한 것들을 이 분야의 전문가들이 명명해놓으니, 현상에 대한 이해가 한결 쉬워졌습니다. 이 책을 읽으며 제품을 사용해보고 때로는 만들면서 배웠던 것들을 프레임워크를 통해 정리할 수 있는 좋은 기회가 되었습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;최근 1~2년 동안 회사에서 사용자와 거리가 먼 기술 중심의 업무를 하다 보니, 제품을 바라보는 시각이 점점 무뎌지고 있다는 걸 종종 느꼈습니다. 그럴 때마다 사용자의 목소리를 듣기 위해 고객 문의 채널을 살펴보거나 데이터를 분석하는 일을 틈틈이 해왔던 것 같아요. 그런데 마침 이 책이 그 갈증을 해소해 주었고, 읽는 내내 우리 제품에 빗대어 생각하며 다양한 영감을 얻을 수 있었습니다. 책을 읽으며 들었던 생각을 동료들과 나누며 발산 할 수 있는 기회도 되었습니다. 제로 단계에서 어떤 실패와 성공을 거쳐 글로벌 네트워크를 구축했는지를 다룬 책이니, 꼭 사용자 간 연결을 기반으로 한 제품을 만들지 않더라도 제품 성장에 대한 영감을 얻고 싶다면 일독을 권합니다.

Provider ↔ Consumer, Content Creator ↔ Consumer, Driver ↔ Passenger, Male ↔ Female 처럼 말이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, Uber에서는 운전 기사가 있어야 승객이 있고, Tinder에서는 여성 사용자가 있어야 남성 사용자가 있다. 이처럼 초기 원자 네트워크에는 특정한 역학 관계가 작용한다. 또한, 소수의 사용자가 지나치게 많은 가치를 창출하면서 강력한 권력을 차지하게 되는 현상도 발생할 수 있다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Uber: 상위 20% 드라이버가 전체 60% 승객을 태운다.</li>\n  <li>Tinder: 여성은 5%의 남성을 선택하지만 평균 남성은 45% 여성을 선택한다.</li>\n  <li>Wikipedia: 전체 사용자는 수억명, 월 활성 작성자가 10만명이지만, 100건 이상 글 편집자는 4,000명(0.02%). Steven Pruitt 라는 한 개인은 영문 위키피디아의 1/3을 작성함(35,000개 글, 300만번 이상 수정).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크 내의 유저는 보통 한 쪽이 다른 한 쪽보다 데려오기 어렵다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>소셜 네트워크: 모두가 소비하는 미디어를 만드는 콘텐츠 창작자</li>\n  <li>앱스토어: 제품을 제작하는 개발자</li>\n  <li>업무용 앱: 문서와 프로젝트를 작성하고 제작하며 동료들을 불러 모으는 관리자</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>그리고 이걸 네트워크의 <strong>하드 사이드(Hard Side)</strong>라고 부른다. 네트워크의 하드 사이드를 관리하고 이들을 만족시키는 것이 원자 네트워크보다 더 중요하다. 따라서 제품이 네트워크 기반으로 성장 하기를 원한다면, 하드 사이드부터 정의하는 것이 중요하다. Uber 와 Tinder도 마찬가지다. 위키피디아 사례를 보면, 고작 0.02%에 불과한 의욕 넘치는 사용자들이 나머지 네트워크를 위해 콘텐츠를 발행한다. 위키피디아의 콘텐츠 창작자들 역시 커뮤니티 자체에 매료되었을 가능성이 높다. 사회적 반응과 지위 등 커뮤니티의 역학 관계가 그들이 계속 콘텐츠를 발행하도록 동기를 부여하는 요소가 된다.</p>\n\n<p>하드 사이드를 정의하고 원자 네트워크를 구축하다 보면 마법의 순간(Magic Moment)이 온다. 여기서는 클럽하우스를 예시로 들었는데, 네트워크가 충분히 채워지고 활성화되어 사람들이 올바른 방식으로 소통할 수 있다면, 그때 Magic Moment가 온다고 한다. 흔히 Magic Moment를 찾는 과정을 Product-Market Fit을 찾는 과정이라고 한다. 그렇다면 Magic Moment를 어떻게 측정할 수 있을까? 이는 반대로 접근해 보면 된다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>예시) 우버 ZERO: 승객이 우버 앱을 실행하여 주소를 선택한 후 승차하기로 했을 때 그 지역에 운전기사가 아무도 없는 상황. 네트워크에 있는 다른 사용자들과 상호작용하는 것이 그 상품의 핵심이라면 제로는 그것이 충족될 수 없다는 의미이며, 이는 사용자가 이탈하여 다시는 돌아오지 않을 수도 있다는 뜻이다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>만약 콜드 스타트 문제를 겪고 있다면, 초기 단계에서는 제품에서 빠진 기능을 인간의 노력으로 대체하는 것도 중요하다. 이 책에서는 이를 플린트스토닝(Flintstoning)이라고 표현한다. 초기 네트워크가 형성되면, 플린트스토닝 기법은 가속도를 얻으며 점점 자동화를 향해 진화한다. 네트워크가 스스로 일어설 수 있을 때까지, 중요한 부분을 수동으로 채워 넣는 것이 목표다.</p>\n\n<p>마지막으로 Always Be Hustlin. 2012년, Uber는 앱에 등장하는 ‘ICE CREAM’ 버튼을 누르면 우버 블랙 차량을 통해 아이스크림이 배달되는 이벤트를 진행했다. ‘실제로 도움이 되었나요?’라는 질문에 대한 대답은 이렇다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>개별적인 볼거리로는 회사에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았을 수도 있다. 하지만 시장을 제로에서 티핑 포인트까지 끌어올리는 프레임워크 안에서, 이러한 재빠르고 영리한 전술은 시장이 이륙하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했다고 생각한다. 가장 중요한 것은, 우버가 이런 개념을 빠르게 식별하고 실행하며 반복할 수 있는 시스템을 만들었다는 점이다. 이러한 시스템을 구축하는 데 도움을 준 것은 <strong>진취적인 팀 문화, 강력한 소프트웨어 제작 도구, 그리고 각 도시마다 고유한 콜드 스타트 문제가 있다는 것에 대한 이해</strong>다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>차량 공유 앱에서 아이스크림을 배달해준다? 이벤트만 보면 서비스 성장에 전혀 영향을 미칠것 같지 않다. 그런데 이런 이벤트들은 Uber 1.0 Cultural Values에 기반한 것이고 이걸 보니 정말 많은 시도를 했겠다는 생각이 들었다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Make Magic</strong>: Seek breakthrough that will stand the test of time</li>\n  <li><strong>Super pumped</strong>: The world is a puzzle to be solved with enthusiasm</li>\n  <li><strong>Inside Out</strong>: Find the gap between popular perception and reality</li>\n  <li><strong>Be an Owner, Not a Renter</strong>: Revolutions are won by true believers</li>\n  <li><strong>Optimistic Leadership</strong>: Be inspiring</li>\n  <li><strong>Be Yourself</strong>: Each of us should be authentic</li>\n  <li><strong>Big Bold Bets</strong>: Take risks and plant seeds that are five to ten years out</li>\n  <li><strong>Customer Obsession</strong>: Start with what’s best for the customer</li>\n  <li><strong>Always Be Hustlin’</strong>: Get more done with less, working longer, harder, and smarter, not just two out of three</li>\n  <li><strong>Let Builders Build</strong>: People must be empowered to build things</li>\n  <li><strong>Winning</strong>: Champion’s Mindset</li>\n  <li><strong>Principled Confrontation</strong>: Sometimes the world and institutions need to change in order for the future to be ushered in</li>\n  <li><strong>Meritocracy and Toe-Stepping</strong>: The best idea always wins.

본격적으로 시작된다. 그리고 경쟁자를 물리치기 위한 네트워크 효과가 발동한다. 재미있는 점은, 여기서 경쟁은 단순히 더 좋은 기능이나 실행력에 관한 것만이 아니라, 한 제품의 생태계가 다른 제품의 생태계를 어떻게 위협하는가에 대한 문제로 확장된다는 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, Airbnb가 시장에서 이탈 속도(Escape Velocity)에 도달하면, 콜드 스타트 문제(Cold Start Problem)는 새로운 진입자에 대한 방어책이 된다. 결국, 도시에 진입하는 경쟁 제품은 모두 콜드 스타트 문제를 해결하여 동일한 밀도를 구축해야 한다. 여러분이 0에서 티핑 포인트(Tipping Point)까지 가는 데 어려움을 겪었던 것처럼, 불리한 조건에서 시작하는 경쟁 업체에게는 더욱 큰 도전이 될

이야기들</h1>\n\n<p>여기까지가 책 전체에 나온 콜드 스타트 이론(Cold Start Theory)에 대한 정리다. 여기부터는 콜드 스타트 &amp; 네트워크 효과에 대한 흥미로웠던 이야기들을 정리해놓았다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"알리-임계값-allee-threshold\">알리 임계값 Allee Threshold:</h3>\n\n<p>미어캣은 아프리카 남부에 사는 극도로 사회적인 동물로, 보통 서른에서 쉰 마리 정도가 모여 무리를 지어 생활한다. 그 이유는 포식자가 접근하면 무리 중 한 마리가 두 발로 서서 경계를 서고 복잡한 경고음을 내어 다른 개체들에게 위험을 알리기 때문이다. 이들은 포식자가 공중인지 지상인지, 위험도가 낮은지, 중간인지, 높은지에 따라 다양한 방식으로 짖거나 휘파람 소리를 낸다. 이러한 경고 시스템 덕분에 무리는 안전을 유지할 수 있다. 이러한 동물의 집단 행동은 1930년대 시카고 대학교의 생태학자 워더 클라이드 알리(Warder Clyde Allee)에 의해 처음으로 연구되었다.</p>\n\n<p>그는 논문 <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.1400610202\">동물 집단 연구: 금붕어의 콜로이드 은에 대한 집단 보호(Studies in Animal Aggregations: Mass Protection Against Colloidal Silver Among Goldfishes)</a>를 통해 흥미로운 사실을 발견했다. 그에 따르면, 금붕어는 집단으로 있을 때 더 빠르게 성장하고, 물의 독성을 더 잘 견딜 수 있다. 이러한 개념은 생물학에서 중요한 개념이 되었으며, 집단 크기가 임계점을 넘어야 개체들이 더 안전해지고, 결국 개체군이 더 빠르게 성장할 수 있다는 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">알리 임계값(Allee Threshold)</code> 개념이 탄생했다. 즉, 알리의 인구 성장 곡선은 생태학적 네트워크 효과(Network Effect)와 유사하다.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2025/01/30/allee-threshold.png\" alt=\"Allee Threshold\" title=\"Allee Threshold\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>메시징 앱을 사용하는 사람이 적으면, 기존 사용자도 앱을 삭제한다:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>사용자 수가 줄어들면, 네트워크의 가치가 감소 → 점점 더 많은 사람들이 앱을 떠남 → 네트워크 붕괴</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>반면, 건강한 미어캣 무리는 지속적으로 성장하며 새로운 무리를 형성할 가능성이 있다:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>알리 임계값을 넘어서면 개체군은 지속적으로 증가</li>\n  <li>충분한 개체 수가 유지되는 한, 약간의 개체 손실이 있어도 전체 인구는 안정적으로 유지</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>하지만 이러한 성장은 영원히 지속될 수 없다. 결국, 환경이 제공할 수 있는 자원의 한계(예: 미어캣이 먹는 곤충과 과일의 양) 때문에 개체군이 어느 정도 이상으로 증가할 수 없다. 이것을 <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">수용력(Carrying Capacity)</code>이라고 한다.</p>\n\n<p>우버(Uber)와 알리 곡선(Allee Curve) 예시:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>도시 내에 운전자가 감소 → 차량 호출 시간이 길어짐 → 사용자 서비스 이탈 → 운전자도 플랫폼 이탈 → 우버 네트워크 붕괴</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>하지만 임계점을 넘어서면, 네트워크가 원활하게 작동한다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>운전자가 증가 → 대기 시간이 감소 → 사용자 증가 → 운전자 증가</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>그러나 네트워크가 너무 커지면 한계에 도달한다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>기다림 없이 차량을 이용하는 것은 편리하지만, 운전자가 너무 많으면 오히려 플랫폼 운영이 비효율적</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>즉, <strong>네트워크가 성장하는 데는 적절한 균형점이 필요</strong>하다. 알리 임계값은 단순한 생태학 개념이 아니라, 기술 제품의 네트워크 효과에도 그대로 적용된다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>초기에는 임계값을 넘을 수 있도록 사용자 확보가 필수적이다.</li>\n  <li>네트워크가 성장하면 최적의 수용력을 유지해야 한다.</li>\n  <li>그렇지 않으면 네트워크는 붕괴할 가능성이 크다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크 기반 제품이 성공하려면, 이러한 생태학적 법칙을 이해하고 적절한 성장 전략을 적용해야 한다.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"수익성-부족에-대한-이야기\">수익성 부족에 대한 이야기:</h3>\n\n<p>티핑 포인트를 빠르게 거쳐가기 위해 수익이 나지 않는 것이 현명한 이유는 무엇일까? 수익성 부족이 네트워크가 티핑 포인트를 더 빠르게 지나게 하는 현명한 전략이 될 수 있는 이유를 다음과 같이 설명했다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>소수의 원자 네트워크를 구축한 후에는 돈을 지출하여 전체 시장에 진입하고 싶어질 것이다. 마켓플레이스의 경우, 구매자에게는 낮은 가격, 판매자에게는 높은 수익이 핵심적인 가치 제안이 된다. 사회적 제품에서도 마찬가지로, 커뮤니케이션이든 콘텐츠 공유든 중요한 요소가 된다. 여기서 콘텐츠 창작자에게 중요한 것은 청중 확보와 수익 창출 모두다.</li>\n  <li>일단 시장에서 승리하면, 거의 언제나 규모에 맞게 인센티브를 줄이는 것이 목표가 된다. 플랫폼에서 처리 가능한 전체 시장이 활성화되면, 더 이상 구매 비용에 지출할 필요가 없어진다.</li>\n  <li>단기간에는 수익이 나지 않을 것 같아도, 시장이 내게 유리한 티핑 포인트에 도달한다면 장기적으로 우위를 점할 수 있다.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"인접-사용자-이론-adjacent-users-theory\">인접 사용자 이론 Adjacent Users Theory:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://andrewchen.com/the-adjacent-user-theory/\">The Adjacent User Theory</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>네트워크는 여러 개의 작은 네트워크로 이루어져 있으며, 일부 네트워크는 다른 네트워크보다 훨씬 더 활성화되어 있다. 일반적으로, 가장 먼저 형성된 핵심 네트워크(Core Network)가 가장 건강하고 활발하게 작동한다. 그러나 핵심 네트워크에서 멀어질수록 참여도가 낮은 사용자 그룹과 거의 활성화되지 않은 네트워크가 존재하게 된다. 즉, 제품을 인지하고 있으며 테스트해본 경험은 있지만, 여전히 참여형 사용자가 되지 못한 이들이다.</p>\n\n<p>예를 들어, eBay의 초기 핵심 시장은 미국의 수집품(Collectibles) 커뮤니티였지만, 자동차 같은 고가품을 거래하는 사용자들에게는 적합하지 않았다. 또한, 결제 시스템이 원활하지 않은 국제 시장과 같은 완전히 비활성화된 네트워크도 존재했다.</p>\n\n<p>이러한 인접 네트워크(Adjacent Networks)를 이해하고 하나씩 공략하는 것이 성장과 시장 확장의 핵심 전략이다.</p>\n\n<p>책에 나온 Instagram 사례:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만 성장이 지수적(exponential)이 아닌 선형적(linear)으로 진행되고 있었음. 이는 일반적인 제품이라면 큰 성공이지만, 소셜 네트워크 제품은 네트워크 효과를 통해 폭발적인 성장을 지속해야 하는 특성이 있음. 당시 Instagram의 VP Growth, Bangaly Kaba는 성장이 둔화된 이유를 분석하고, 이를 해결하기 위한 전략을 개발해 10억 명 이상의 사용자로 확장할 수 있도록 만듦.</li>\n  <li>2016년, Instagram은 이미 4억 명 이상의 사용자를 보유하고 있었지만, 성장이

개발하여 사용자를 10억 명 이상으로 확장할 수 있도록 만들었다. 이 때 그가 접근한 방식은 인접 사용자(Adjacent User)에 대한 분석이었다. 이들이 제품을 정착하지 못한 이유는 현재 제품의 포지셔닝 이나 사용자 경험이 이들에게 적합하지 않기 때문이었다. 4억 명의 기존 사용자들에게는 Product-Market Fit이 있었지만, 수십억 명의 새로운 사용자들은 Instagram을 자신의 삶과 연결하지 못하고 있었음.</li>\n  <li>초기 인접 사용자는 미국의 35~45세 여성으로, Facebook은 사용하지만 Instagram의 가치를 이해하지 못하는 그룹. 이들을 위해 Facebook 프로필과 친구 관계 데이터를 활용하여 친구 및 가족을 쉽게 찾을 수 있도록 추천 알고리즘을 개선함.</li>\n  <li>후기 인접 사용자는 자카르타에서 저사양 3G 안드로이드폰을 사용하는 예비 사용자. 이들을 위해 낮은 데이터 소비를 지원하는 앱 최적화 작업을 진행함.</li>\n  <li>Instagram은 총 8개의 주요 인접 사용자 그룹을 단계적으로 해결해 나가면서, 성장 정체를 극복하고 폭발적인 확장을 이루어냄.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"컨텍스트의-붕괴-context-collapse\">컨텍스트의 붕괴 Context Collapse:</h3>\n\n<p>모든 네트워크는 초기에 특정 원자 네트워크(Atomic Network)를 중심으로 형성된다. 이 시기에는 네티켓(Netiquette), 즉 네트워크 내에서 허용되는 행동과 금기사항이 자연스럽게 정해지며, 특정 문화가 형성된다. 그러나 시간이 지나면서 이러한 문화는 점점 약화되기 쉬워지고, 결국 맥락 붕괴(Context Collapse)가 발생한다.</p>\n\n<p>이러한 컨텍스트 붕괴는 서로 다른 사용자 그룹이 하나의 네트워크에서 충돌할 때 발생한다. 예를 들어, Facebook이 초기에는 친한 친구들끼리 사적인 이야기, 사진, 농담을 공유하는 공간으로 활용되었지만, 시간이 지나면서 친척, 가족, 선생님, 상사까지 유입되었다. 이로 인해 사용자는 콘텐츠를 자유롭게 게시하지 못하게 되고, 활동이 줄어들면서 네트워크 성장에도 부정적인 영향을 미치게 된다.</p>\n\n<p>컨텍스트 붕괴는 너무나도 많은 네트워크가 동시에 모였을 때 발생한다.</p>\n\n<p>컨텍스트 붕괴의

Cold Start Theory, Network Effects, Adjacent Users Theory 등 우리가 이미 알고 있고 경험한 것들을 이 분야의 전문가들이 명명해놓으니, 현상에 대한 이해가 한결 쉬워졌습니다. 이 책을 읽으며 제품을 사용해보고 때로는 만들면서 배웠던 것들을 프레임워크를 통해 정리할 수 있는 좋은 기회가 되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>최근 1~2년 동안 회사에서 사용자와 거리가 먼 기술 중심의 업무를 하다 보니, 제품을 바라보는 시각이 점점 무뎌지고 있다는 걸 종종 느꼈습니다. 그럴 때마다 사용자의 목소리를 듣기 위해 고객 문의 채널을 살펴보거나 데이터를 분석하는 일을 틈틈이 해왔던 것 같아요. 그런데 마침 이 책이 그 갈증을 해소해 주었고, 읽는 내내 우리 제품에 빗대어 생각하며 다양한 영감을 얻을 수 있었습니다. 책을 읽으며 들었던 생각을 동료들과 나누며 발산 할 수 있는 기회도 되었습니다. 제로 단계에서 어떤 실패와 성공을 거쳐 글로벌 네트워크를 구축했는지를 다룬 책이니, 꼭 사용자 간 연결을 기반으로 한 제품을 만들지 않더라도 제품 성장에 대한 영감을 얻고 싶다면 일독을 권합니다.

        "contentSnippet": "알리바바가 발표한 AI 모델 'Qwen'이 화제입니다. 텍스트뿐 아니라 이미지·영상 생성까지 가능한 이 모델은 DeepSeek과의 비교에서 우위를 점하며 AI 시장에 새로운 바람을 불러일으키고 있습니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 AI 관련 소식을 보면서 여러분도 눈에 띄는 모델 하나쯤 있지 않나요? 최근까지만 해도 DeepSeek이 업계의 화두였는데, 그 여파로 이번엔 알리바바의 신작 AI 모델인 Qwen(콴)이 주목받고 있습니다.\n \n저도 처음엔 “중국의 기술력이 어느 정도일까?” 하는 의구심이 있었지만 Qwen을 직접 살펴본 후 생각이 확 바뀌었어요. 단순히 대화형 AI에서 끝나지 않고 이미지와 영상 생성까지 가능한 이 모델은, AI 시장의 게임 체인저가 될 가능성이 크다고 봅니다. 오늘은 Qwen이 왜 그렇게 주목받고 있는지, DeepSeek과는 어떻게 다른지에 대해 Qwen를 중심으로 차근차근 정리해 드릴게요.\n \n  Qwen AI의 탄생 배경과 주요 기능\n  언어 처리의 새로운 기준\n알리바바는 72억 개의 파라미터로 Qwen을 구축했어요. 수치만 보면 압도적이죠. 다만 AI 모델에서 중요한 건 숫자가 아니라 실제 성능인데요, Qwen은 이 부분에서도 상당히 만족스러운 결과를 보여줍니다.\n\n\n \n29개 언어 지원으로 전 세계 다양한 언어로 자연스럽게 소통할 수 있어요. 기존의 다국어 지원 AI 모델이 언어별로 미세한 번역 오류를 내는 경우가 많았지만, Qwen은 그런 문제를 대폭 줄였다는 평가를 받고 있습니다.\n \n그뿐만이 아니에요. 이미지와 영상 콘텐츠를 자동으로 생성할 수 있는 기능도 큰 특징입니다. 예를 들어, 사용자가 마케팅용 이미지를 빠르게 만들어야 한다면 프롬프트만 입력하면 적합한 비주얼 콘텐츠가 바로 생성되죠. 시간과 비용 절약에 이보다 더 좋을 순 없습니다.\n \nQwen 바로가기\n        \n    \n \n  Qwen과 DeepSeek의 성능 비교\nDeepSeek과 비교하면 Qwen의 성능은 어느 정도일까요? 객관적인 벤치마크 결과를 보겠습니다:\nArena-Hard 테스트:\n\nQwen: 89.4점\nDeepSeek: 85.5점\nMMLU-Pro(다중 작업 능력 테스트):\n\nQwen: 76.1점\nDeepSeek: 75.9점\nGPQA-Diamond(질문-응답 정확도):\n\nQwen: 60.1점\nDeepSeek: 59.1점\n\n\n \n 이 수치가 의미하는 바는 단순 점수 그 이상이에요. 특히 Qwen의 질문 응답 정확도가 높은 것은 AI 사용자 경험에 큰 영향을 미치는데요, 단순 정보 검색이나 지식을 묻는 질문에서도 Qwen이 더 구체적이고 유연한 답변을 제공하는 경우가 많습니다.\nDeepSeek은 특정 분야에서는 높은 전문성을 보이지만, 사용자 맞춤형 대화에서는 종종 한계를 보였죠. 반면, Qwen은 더 인간적인 대화 흐름을 만들어내기 때문에 사용자의 만족도가 높은 편입니다.\n \nDeepSeek 바로가기\n        \n    \n \n  Qwen의 상용화 가능성과 비용 효율성\n  비용: Qwen은 과연 합리적인가?\nDeepSeek의 가격은 백만 토큰당 0.25달러로 저렴한 편입니다. 하지만 Qwen은 그보다 약간 비싼 0.38달러를 부과하죠. 그럼에도 제공하는 기능의 폭과 정확성을 고려했을 때 이 가격은 충분히 합리적이라는 평가를 받고 있어요.\n또한 Qwen은 오픈소스로 제공돼 개발자들이 직접 모델을 다운로드하고 커스터마이징할 수 있습니다. GitHub나 HuggingFace와 같은 플랫폼에서 쉽게 접근할 수 있어요.\n비용 측면에서 주목할 만한 또 다른 점은 로컬 환경에서도 실행이 가능하다는 것입니다. 보안이 중요한 데이터를 처리해야 하는 기업에게 이는 매우 큰 장점이죠. 인터넷에 연결하지 않고도 내부 데이터를 안전하게 분석할 수 있으니까요.\n \n \n  Qwen의 한계와 보완 가능성\n느린 초기 응답 속도\n하지만 Qwen도 완벽하진 않습니다. 대표적인 단점은 초기 프롬프트 응답 속도인데요, 특히 첫 번째 요청을 보낼 때 30초 이상 기다려야 할 때가 종종 있습니다. 이는 서버 부하나 네트워크 상태에 따라 발생하는 문제로 보이며, 알리바바 측에서도 이를 개선하기 위한 확장 계획을 발표한 바 있습니다.\n이미지·비디오 생성 품질의 한계\n또 한 가지는 비주얼 콘텐츠의 세부 품질입니다. 단순한 이미지나 비디오는 금방 생성되지만, 세밀한 디테일을 요구하는 작업에서는 품질이 아쉬운 경우가 있어요. 마케팅 자료로는 충분하지만, 고해상도 광고나 정밀한 그래픽 작업에서는 보완 소프트웨어가 필요할 수 있습니다.\n항목\nQwen\nDeepSeek\n\n\n\n\n파라미터 수\n72억 개\n45억 개\n\n\n지원 언어\n29개 언어\n18개 언어\n\n\n텍스트 처리 성능 (Arena-Hard)\n89.4점\n85.5점\n\n\n다중 작업 능력 (MMLU-Pro)\n76.1점\n75.9점\n\n\n질문 응답 정확도 (GPQA-Diamond)\n60.1점\n59.1점\n\n\n비용 (백만 토큰당)\n0.38달러\n0.25달러\n\n\n특징\n텍스트, 이미지, 비디오 생성 가능\n텍스트 생성 중심\n\n\n오픈소스 여부\n지원 (GitHub, HuggingFace에서 다운로드 가능)\n비공개\n\n\n로컬 실행 가능 여부\n가능\n불가능\n\n\n\n \n \n✅ 마치며\nQwen AI는 알리바바가 AI 기술력의 최전선에 서 있음을 보여주는 증거예요. DeepSeek이 이끄는 시장에 도전장을 던진 이 모델은 더 인간적인 대화, 더 빠른 비전 콘텐츠 생성, 더 다양한 언어 지원으로 앞으로도 주목받을 것입니다.\n혹시 여러분도 비즈니스에서 AI 도입을 고려하고 있다면 Qwen의 기능을 테스트해 보세요. 작은 프로젝트에서 시작해도 새로운 가능성을 찾을 수 있을 겁니다. AI가 여러분의 일상을 어떻게 바꿀지 기대되지 않나요?\n❓ Q&A\n1. Qwen은 주로 어떤 분야에서 활용되나요?\n대규모 데이터 분석, 고객 서비스, 금융 리포트 생성, 마케팅 콘텐츠 제작 등 다양한 분야에서 활용됩니다.\n2. DeepSeek과 Qwen 중 어느 쪽이 더 낫나요?\n비용 효율성을 중시하면 DeepSeek, 사용자 친화성과 정확성을 중시하면 Qwen이 더 적합합니다.\n3. Qwen은 비전문가도 사용할 수 있나요?\n네, 기본 프롬프트 설정만으로도 결과를 도출할 수 있어 비전문가도 쉽게 접근 가능합니다.\n4.

id=\"윈도우-11과-우분투-2404-듀얼부팅-시-윈도우에서-발생하는-시간-오류-문제\">윈도우 11과 우분투 24.04 듀얼부팅 시 윈도우에서 발생하는 시간 오류 문제</h3>\n<p>최근 우분투 24.04 LTS 버전을 설치해 윈도우 11과 듀얼부팅으로 사용하고 있다. 일차적인 이유는 업무상 필요성이고, 추가로 NTFS 및 ReFS 파일 시스템의 느린 성능과 윈도우 11의 전반적인 느린 동작 등 여러 불만 사항을 해소하기 위함이다.</p>\n<p>물론 우분투만 사용할 수 없으므로, HDR 콘텐츠 감상이나 게임 등 휴식을 위해 윈도우도 사용한다. 그런데 듀얼부팅 환경에서 한 가지 이상한 증상이 나타났다.<br>윈도우에서 단독 부팅하거나, 윈도우 → 우분투, 우분투 → 우분투로 부팅할 때는 시스템 시간이 정상적으로 표시되지만, 우분투로 부팅한 후 윈도우로 재부팅하면 하드웨어 시계가 UTC 기준으로 설정되어 있어 윈도우에서 시간이 잘못 표시된다.</p>\n<h4 class=\"atx\" id=\"우분투-사용-후-윈도우에서-시간이-잘못-표시되는-이유\">우분투 사용 후 윈도우에서 시간이 잘못 표시되는 이유</h4>\n<p>이 문제의 원인은 우분투를 비롯한 대부분의 리눅스 배포판이 기본적으로 하드웨어 시계를 <strong>UTC 기준</strong>으로 관리하는 반면, 윈도우는 하드웨어 시계를 **로컬 시간(지역 시간)**으로 관리하기 때문이다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>우분투 측</strong><br>우분투는 부팅 시 인터넷 시간과 동기화하면서 하드웨어 시계를 UTC 기준으로 저장한다. 그리고 시스템에서는 KST(서울, UTC+9)를 적용해 사용자에게 올바른 지역 시각으로 표시한다.</li>\n<li><strong>윈도우 측</strong><br>윈도우는 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 인식하여 그대로 표시한다. 따라서 우분투에서 저장한 UTC 값이 그대로 적용되므로, 실제 시간보다 9시간 늦은 시각이 표시되는 것이다.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 class=\"atx\" id=\"해결-방안\">해결 방안</h4>\n<p>문제 해결은 간단하다. 우분투에서 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 관리하도록 설정하면 된다.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>터미널에서 아래 명령어를 실행하여 우분투가 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 해석하도록 변경한다.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"fenced-code-block language-bash\">timedatectl set-local-rtc <span class=\"token number\">1</span> --adjust-system-clock</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li><p>설정이 제대로 적용되었는지 확인하려면 다음 명령어를 입력한다.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"fenced-code-block language-bash\">timedatectl</code></pre>\n<p>출력 결과에 <code>RTC in local TZ: yes</code>가 표시되면 정상적으로 적용된 것이다.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h4 class=\"atx\" id=\"다시-utc-기준으로-복원하려면\">다시 UTC 기준으로 복원하려면</h4>\n<p>특수한 상황에서 다시 하드웨어 시계를 UTC 기준으로 관리해야 할 필요가 있다면, 아래 명령어를 실행하면 된다.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"fenced-code-block language-bash\">timedatectl set-local-rtc

ReFS 파일 시스템의 느린 성능과 윈도우 11의 전반적인 느린 동작 등 여러 불만 사항을 해소하기 위함이다.\n물론 우분투만 사용할 수 없으므로, HDR 콘텐츠 감상이나 게임 등 휴식을 위해 윈도우도 사용한다. 그런데 듀얼부팅 환경에서 한 가지 이상한 증상이 나타났다.\n윈도우에서 단독 부팅하거나, 윈도우 → 우분투, 우분투 → 우분투로 부팅할 때는 시스템 시간이 정상적으로 표시되지만, 우분투로 부팅한 후 윈도우로 재부팅하면 하드웨어 시계가 UTC 기준으로 설정되어 있어 윈도우에서 시간이 잘못 표시된다.\n우분투 사용 후 윈도우에서 시간이 잘못 표시되는 이유\n이 문제의 원인은 우분투를 비롯한 대부분의 리눅스 배포판이 기본적으로 하드웨어 시계를 UTC 기준으로 관리하는 반면, 윈도우는 하드웨어 시계를 **로컬 시간(지역 시간)**으로 관리하기 때문이다.\n우분투 측\n우분투는 부팅 시 인터넷 시간과 동기화하면서 하드웨어 시계를 UTC 기준으로 저장한다. 그리고 시스템에서는 KST(서울, UTC+9)를 적용해 사용자에게 올바른 지역 시각으로 표시한다.\n윈도우 측\n윈도우는 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 인식하여 그대로 표시한다. 따라서 우분투에서 저장한 UTC 값이 그대로 적용되므로, 실제 시간보다 9시간 늦은 시각이 표시되는 것이다.\n해결 방안\n문제 해결은 간단하다. 우분투에서 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 관리하도록 설정하면 된다.\n터미널에서 아래 명령어를 실행하여 우분투가 하드웨어 시계를 로컬 시간으로 해석하도록 변경한다.\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 1 --adjust-system-clock\n설정이 제대로 적용되었는지 확인하려면 다음 명령어를 입력한다.\ntimedatectl\n출력 결과에 RTC in local TZ: yes가 표시되면 정상적으로 적용된 것이다.\n다시 UTC 기준으로 복원하려면\n특수한 상황에서 다시 하드웨어 시계를 UTC 기준으로 관리해야 할 필요가 있다면, 아래 명령어를 실행하면 된다.\ntimedatectl set-local-rtc 0 --adjust-system-clock",
