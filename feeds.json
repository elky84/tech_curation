These updates include support for targeting the Xbox GDK October 2025 update, removing a misleading and outdated output message, and other minor improvements and bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,750 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n82 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n504 ports were updated by December and 584 ports were updated in January. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n182 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,300 forks and 26,600 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.12.12, 2026.01.16 releases)\nRemoved an outdated output message after running vcpkg upgrade that could mislead users (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1802).\nUpdated vcpkg to understand new layout structure and environment variables for targeting Xbox as of the October 2025 Microsoft GDK update. (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1834, thanks @walbourn!).\n\nGameDKLatest is associated with the ‘old’ layouts and only exists when they are optionally installed by October 2025 or by earlier GDKs. October 2024 GDK or later are still in-service.\nGameDKXboxLatest is associated with the ‘new’ layouts which are always present for October 2025 or later.\nOther minor improvements and bug fixes.\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\nTriplet\nPorts available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2549\n\n\nx64-windows\n2678\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2678\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2557\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2614\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1506\n\n\narm64-windows\n2304\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2290\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1475\n\n\narm64-osx\n2484\n\n\nx64-linux\n2688\n\n\narm-neon-android\n2106\n\n\nx64-android\n2167\n\n\narm64-android\n2134\n\n\nx86-windows\n2549\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing a novel approach to enabling cross-device passkey authentication for devices with inaccessible displays (like XR devices).\nOur approach bypasses the use of QR codes and enables cross-device authentication without the need for an on-device display, while still complying with all trust and proximity requirements.\nThis approach builds on work done by the FIDO Alliance and we hope it will open the door to bring secure, passwordless authentication to a whole new ecosystem of devices and platforms.\nPasskeys are a significant leap forward in authentication, offering a phishing-resistant, cryptographically secure alternative to traditional passwords. Generally, the standard cross-device passkey flow, where someone registers or authenticates on a desktop device by approving the action on their nearby mobile device, is done in a familiar way with QR codes scanned by their phone camera.  But how can we facilitate this flow for XR devices with a head-mounted display or no screen at all, or for other devices with an inaccessible display like smart home hubs and industrial sensors? \nWe’ve taken a  novel approach to adapting the WebAuthn passkey flow and FIDO’s CTAP hybrid protocol for this unique class of devices that either lack a screen entirely or whose screen is not easily accessible to another device’s camera. Our implementation has been developed and is now broadly available on Meta Quest devices powered by Meta Horizon OS. We hope that this approach can also ensure robust security built on the strength of existing passkey frameworks, without sacrificing usability, for users of a variety of other screenless IoT devices, consumer electronics, and industrial hardware.\n\nThe Challenge: No Screen, No QR Code\nThe standard cross-device flow relies on two primary mechanisms:\nQR code scanning: The relying party displays a QR code on the desktop/inaccessible device, which the mobile authenticator scans to establish a secure link.\nBluetooth/NFC proximity: The devices use local communication protocols to discover each other and initiate the secure exchange.\nFor devices with no display, the QR code method is impossible. Proximity-based discovery is feasible, but initiating the user verification step and confirming the intent without any on-device visual feedback can introduce security and usability risks. People need clear assurance that they are approving the correct transaction on the correct device.\nOur Solution: Using a Companion App for Secure Message Transport\nScanning a QR code sends the authenticator device a command to initiate a hybrid (cross-device) login flow with a nonce that identifies the unauthenticated device client. But if a user has a companion application – like the Meta Horizon app – that uses the same account as the device we can use that application to pass this same request to the authenticator OS and execute it using general link/intent execution.\nWe made the flow easy to navigate by using in-app notifications to show users when a login request has been initiated, take them directly into the application, and immediately execute the login request.\nFor simplicity, we opted to begin the hybrid flow as soon as the application is opened since the user would have had to take some action (clicking the notification or opening the app) to trigger this and there is an additional user verification step in hybrid implementations on iOS and Android.\nHere’s how this plays out on a Meta Quest with the Meta Horizon mobile app:\n\n1. The Hybrid Flow Message Is Generated\nWhen a passkey login is initiated on the Meta Quest, the headset’s browser locally constructs the same payload that would have been embedded in a QR Code – including a fresh ECDH public key, a session-specific secret, and routing information used later in the handshake. Instead of rendering this information into an image (QR code), the browser encodes it into a FIDO URL (the standard mechanism defined for hybrid transport) that instructs the mobile device to begin the passkey authentication flow.\n2. The Message Is Sent to the Companion App\nAfter the FIDO URL is generated, the headset requires a secure and deterministic method for transferring it to the user’s phone. Because the device cannot present a QR code, the system leverages the Meta Horizon app’s authenticated push channel to deliver the FIDO URL directly to the mobile device. When the user selects the passkey option in the login dialog, the headset encodes the FIDO URL as structured data within a GraphQL-based push notification. \nThe Meta Horizon app, signed in with the same account as the headset, receives this payload and validates the delivery context to ensure it is routed to the correct user. \n3. The Application Sends a Notification of the Login Request\nAfter the FIDO URL is delivered to the mobile device, the platform’s push service surfaces it as a standard iOS or Android notification indicating that a login request is pending. When the user taps the notification, the operating system routes the deep link to the Meta Horizon app. The app then opens the FIDO URL using the system URL launcher and invokes the operating system passkey interface.\nFor users that have the notification turned off or disabled, launching the Meta Horizon app directly will also trigger a query to the backend for any pending passkey requests associated with the user’s account. If a valid request exists (requests expire after five minutes), the app automatically initiates the same passkey flow by opening the FIDO URL.\nOnce the FIDO URL is opened, the mobile device begins the hybrid transport sequence, including broadcasting the BLE advertisement, establishing the encrypted tunnel, and producing the passkey assertion. In this flow, the system notification and the app launch path both serve as user consent surfaces and entry points into the standard hybrid transport workflow.\n4. The App Executes the Hybrid Command\nOnce the user approves the action on their mobile device, the secure channel is established as per WebAuthn standards. The main difference is the challenge exchange timing:\nThe inaccessible device generates the standard WebAuthn challenge and waits.\nThe mobile authenticator, initiates the secure BLE/NFC connection.\nThe challenge is transmitted over this secure channel.\nUpon UV success, the mobile device uses the relevant key material to generate the AuthenticatorAssertionResponse or AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.\nThe response is sent back to the inaccessible device.\nThe inaccessible device then acts as the conduit, forwarding the response to the relying party server to complete the transaction, exactly as a standard display-equipped device would.\nImpact and Future Direction\nThis novel implementation successfully bypasses the need for an on-device display in the cross-device flow and still complies with the proximity and other trust challenges that exist today for cross-device passkey login. We hope that our solution paves the way for secure, passwordless authentication across a wider range of different platforms and ecosystems, moving passkeys beyond just mobile and desktop environments and into the burgeoning world of wearable and IoT devices. \nWe are proud to build on top of the excellent work already done in this area by our peers in the FIDO Alliance and mobile operating systems committed to this work and building a robust and interoperable ecosystem for secure and easy login.\nThe post No Display?

        "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:39:51 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Qodana is a static code analysis tool that brings code inspections and quick-fixes from JetBrains IDEs to the realm of continuous integration. It can be run in the cloud, executed from a Docker container, integrated into CI/CD pipelines, or invoked through a JetBrains IDE.\nQodana already offers an impressive suite of inspections, but it is not limited to what comes built in. You can add custom inspections to enforce project specifics and conventions.\nFor example, imagine a project with a specific code convention:\nEach Kotlin class in a service package must have a Service suffix.\nIn this case, com.jetbrains.service.JetComponent would not conform to this convention, while com.jetbrains.service.BrainComponentService would be perfectly fine. In what follows, we’ll build a plugin that implements this inspection, allowing Qodana to enforce this convention in future projects.\nWe can implement this code convention by creating a custom code inspection packaged in a plugin. Qodana plugins are developed just like JetBrains IDE plugins, which is to say we simply need to create an IntelliJ Platform plugin that can be run in Qodana. Here’s a quick overview of the steps we’ll take:\nInitialize the project from the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template.\nAdjust the project properties and plugin descriptor along with necessary dependencies.\nDeclare the local inspection in the plugin descriptor and implement it in Kotlin.\nBuild and package the plugin.\nIn the example playground project, put the plugin artifact into a proper directory.\nAdjust the Qodana configuration file.\nRun Qodana and look at the report!\nPreparing the plugin project\nTo bootstrap the project, visit the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template repository and click the Use this template button to create a plugin repository. Name it classname-inspection-qodana-plugin, copy the project URL, and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. When the project is ready, customize gradle.properties by declaring the pluginGroup, pluginName, and pluginRepositoryUrl as necessary. Remember to click the Sync Gradle Changes floating button to apply the changes. To modify the unique plugin identifier, change the id element in the plugin descriptor plugin.xml.\nDeclaring dependencies\nOur code inspection targets Kotlin classes, so we need to add the Kotlin plugin to the Qodana plugin’s dependencies. The gradle.properties file requires you to declare:\nplatformBundledPlugins = org.jetbrains.kotlin\nIn addition, the plugin descriptor plugin.xml must contain the same bundled Kotlin plugin in its dependencies:\n<depends>org.jetbrains.kotlin</depends>\nAgain, remember to sync Gradle changes by clicking the floating button.\nIn addition, the Kotlin class inspection needs to support the Kotlin K2 Compiler, which has been enabled by default since version 2025.1 of the IntelliJ Platform. In the plugin descriptor, declare the org.jetbrains.kotlin.supportsKotlinPluginMode extension.\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"org.jetbrains.kotlin\">\n    <supportsKotlinPluginMode supportsK2=\"true\" />\n</extensions>\nCreating the code inspection\nThe actual code for any code inspection that targets Kotlin classes requires three steps:\nDeclare a com.intellij.localInspection extension in the plugin descriptor along with the necessary attributes and a fully qualified reference to the implementation class.\nCreate an implementation class, preferably in Kotlin.\nProvide a standalone HTML file with an inspection description, usage guidelines, and an example.\nDeclaring the extension\nAdd the following declaration to the plugin.xml plugin descriptor file:\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <localInspection\n        language=\"kotlin\"\n        implementationClass=\"org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\"\n        enabledByDefault=\"true\"\n        displayName=\"SDK: Discouraged class name\"\n        groupName=\"Kotlin\"\n    />\n</extensions>\nThe language attribute indicates that the inspection applies to Kotlin source code files. It is important to explicitly enable the inspection by default; otherwise, Qodana will not run it. Then provide a human-readable descriptive displayName to be shown in the report and settings. The groupName attribute sets the inspection category that is shown both in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings. Finally, provide a fully qualified name for the implementation class.\nCode inspection source code\nThe Kotlin plugin provides a useful base inspection class for Kotlin inspections: AbstractKotlinInspection. Override the buildVisitor method and provide a PSI visitor instance that traverses the Kotlin class elements in a type-safe way. classVisitor is a convenient DSL-like function that returns this kind of PSI visitor and is invoked on any Kotlin class in the project you’re inspecting.\npackage org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection\n\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemHighlightType\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemsHolder\nimport com.intellij.psi.PsiElementVisitor\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeinsight.api.classic.inspections.AbstractKotlinInspection\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClass\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtVisitorVoid\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.classVisitor\n\nclass ServicePackageClassNameInspection : AbstractKotlinInspection() {\n    override fun buildVisitor(holder: ProblemsHolder, isOnTheFly: Boolean) = classVisitor { klass ->\n        val classNamePsi = klass.nameIdentifier ?: return@classVisitor\n        val classFqn = klass.fqName?.asString() ?: return@classVisitor\n        if (klass.packageLastComponent == \"service\" && !classFqn.endsWith(\"Service\")) {\n            holder.registerProblem(\n                classNamePsi,\n                \"Class name in the 'service' package must have a 'Service' suffix\"\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val KtClass.packageLastComponent: String\n        get() = containingKtFile.packageFqName.shortName().asString()\n}\nThe visitor subclass extracts the fully qualified Kotlin class name, inspects the rightmost package element, and checks the corresponding suffix. Any improper class name is reported to the ProblemsHolder instance with an enclosing class as a PSI element and a human-readable problem description.\nInspection description\nEach local inspection requires a companion description file, represented as HTML. If you use the Create description file ServicePackageClassNameInspection.html quick-fix, a file named src/main/resources/inspectionDescriptions/ServicePackageClassName.html will be created in the proper location. You’ll also have to provide a description that will be shown in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings.\n<html>\n<body>\nReports class names in the <code>service</code> packages that lack the <code>Service</code> suffix.\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<pre><code>\n  package com.example.foo.service\n  class SomeComponent {\n    /* class members */\n  }\n</code></pre>\n</body>\n</html>\nBuild the plugin\nYou’re all set – time to build! Execute the buildPlugin Gradle task and look at the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip artifact available in the Gradle output directory. The JAR file will be used as the primary artifact in the Qodana scan. \nKeep the plugin artifact type in mind\nQodana does not directly support local ZIP plugin artifacts that include additional JAR archives or third-party dependencies. Any plugin needs to be packaged as a single JAR or unzipped into a specific directory.\nRun Qodana on a playground project\nLet’s create a playground project, written in Kotlin, that we can inspect with Qodana now that we’ve extended it with our plugin. To run the Qodana plugin locally, make sure that two software components are available on your system:\nDocker\nQodana CLI\nOur playground project should contain a class called src/main/kotlin/org/intellij/sdk/qodana/service/SomeComponent.kt, which does not follow our code convention, as it does not have the Service suffix. There are two ways to integrate the Qodana plugin into Qodana:\nPublish it on JetBrains Marketplace\nFor quicker turnaround, put the plugin’s JAR artifact into your project’s .qodana directory.\nTo simplify the build, copy the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file from the plugin project to the .qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file in the playground project. Create the .qodana directory, if it does not yet exist. Then extract the archive with your preferred program or tool. Qodana is able to access the plugin in the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection directory.\nIn addition, Qodana needs to be configured to include our custom code inspection. Change the qodana.yaml file in the root directory of the playground project as follows:\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\ninclude:\n  - name: org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\nThe include block needs to refer to the fully qualified class name of the code inspection available in the plugin. Now execute the following command to run Qodana from the terminal:\nqodana scan --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/qodana-code-inspection\nThis will download the corresponding Qodana Docker image. A Docker container will be created and run based on the Qodana configuration. To make the custom plugin accessible inside the Qodana run, mount the Qodana plugin directory from the local filesystem to the appropriate directory inside the Qodana Docker container. After a couple of minutes, Qodana will produce a report summary and print it to the standard output.\nQodana - Detailed summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nAnalysis results: 1 problem detected                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nBy severity: High - 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nName                           Severity  Problems count                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nSDK: Discouraged class name    High      1                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------\nOpen the full report in your browser:\n  Do you want to open the latest report [Y/n]Yes\n\n!  Press Ctrl+C to stop serving the report\n\n\\  Showing Qodana report from http://localhost:8080/... (10s)\nQodana will show that SomeComponent does not conform to the code convention provided by our local inspection in the Qodana plugin.\n\n\n\n\nTips for future runs\nWhen the Qodana plugin is modified and rebuilt, the Qodana cache needs to be recreated as well. In such cases, use the --clear-cache CLI switch to reload all of the Qodana run’s dependencies.\nqodana scan --clear-cache --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.jar:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/codeinspection.jar\nPlugging Qodana into your IDE\nThe Qodana plugin can be installed from disk into the IDE. Its code inspection is then automatically enabled and invoked for any Kotlin class in a project. To check that it’s working, revisit the playground project, open the org.intellij.sdk.qodana.service.SomeComponent class, and make sure that the problematic class name is underlined. As a convenience, hovering the mouse on the class name will show the code inspection result along with the problem description. Alternatively, you can open the Problems tool window and find the problem in the list of all problems reported by code inspections. \nThe code inspection now behaves like any other inspection provided by the IDE. In Settings | Editor | Inspections | Kotlin, you’ll find the SDK: Discouraged class name inspection, along with the description sourced from the HTML file that we provided before.\nRunning Qodana within the IDE\nWith the plugin installed, you can now run Qodana from your IDE as well. In the Problems tool window, go to the Qodana tab, and click the Try Locally button. Qodana will be configured with the qodana.yaml file and run. The Qodana report can be found directly in the tool window. \n\n\n\n\nQodana plugins and JetBrains Marketplace\nProperly built and tested custom inspection plugins can be published on JetBrains Marketplace, removing the need to serve them from the .qodana directory. Instead, you just need to make sure that the Qodana configuration specifies a public plugin identifier that matches the id element in the plugin descriptor.\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\nplugins: \n  - id: com.github.novotnyr.qodanacodeinspection\nQodana’s scan command is simplified, as the .qodana directory mount is no longer necessary.\nqodana scan\nQodana downloads this plugin from JetBrains Marketplace and runs all its inspections, producing both console output and an HTML report that can be shown in a web browser.\nSummary\nWe have created a Qodana plugin with a code inspection that checks for a specific code convention, and we have a handful of ways to run it:\nAs a JAR placed in the .qodana directory and included in the Qodana YAML file.\nAs a reference to the publicly available plugin on JetBrains Marketplace.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is applied in a local Qodana run.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is included among the integrated code inspections. \nSee the IntelliJ SDK Code sample for concise examples of both the Qodana plugin and a playground project",

There are fewer distractions and fewer launches, which makes it the ideal time to slow down and take a look at what is actually driving the tech world at the moment.\nThis issue leans into that calm, with Trisha Gee joining us as our featured content guest and sharing her thoughts and observations on the latest Java news and how it’s shaping developers’ lives. We explore where Java is heading next, what running on the latest LTS really means, and how the platform keeps improving without chasing hype. Add in some practical tutorials, Kotlin updates, AI gradually becoming capable of more and more everyday development tasks, and a few thoughtful takes along the way, and you have a February read that is relaxed in tone, but rich in ideas. \nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha Gee is a Java Champion, author, and internationally recognized speaker with over two decades of experience in software development. Known for her deep expertise in Java, high-performance systems, and developer productivity, Trisha has worked as a developer and leader in organizations ranging from startups to global enterprises. She’s passionate about sharing knowledge and helping developers write more expressive and efficient code.\nTrisha is the author of multiple technical books, including Head First Java (3rd Edition) and Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA, and she frequently contributes to developer communities through blogs, webinars, and international conferences. She’s also a strong advocate for grassroots learning and regularly supports local user groups and meetups to help developers connect, grow, and thrive. When she’s not writing or coding, she’s championing inclusive practices and mentoring the next generation of developers.\nHappy February, dear readers of Java Annotated Monthly! For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the words “Happy” and “February” do not usually go together. However, I do see the upside of the dark months of January and February, mostly in that things are fairly quiet, travel (for me) is usually limited, and it’s a time to take stock of how you want the rest of the year to go.\nSo let’s look at Java (weird, for a Java newsletter). We now know the list of features coming in Java 26. Java 25, the current version, is the latest LTS, so although you may not be ready to look at Java 26 yet, you should be running on Java 25. It’s incredible to me that Java is still evolving after all these years, and in elegant and useful ways. In Data-Oriented Programming for Java: Beyond Records, Brian Goetz talks about how data can best be represented in Java, and specifically what carrier classes are. I’m always fascinated by how the language evolves and how the engineers decide which features to add or update (like records or carrier classes). If you are too, you should watch this interview with Georges Saab. He also talks about the value of learning (I learned fairly recently that “Hello World” in Java is much simpler to write thanks to new language features). Watch Marit demonstrate them in IntelliJ IDEA. And if you are keen to expand your IntelliJ IDEA/JetBrains IDE knowledge to expert level, maybe you’ll be interested in JetBrains’ Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA full-day workshop, which is led by me!\nI mentioned travel earlier in this piece – sadly I will not be going to JavaOne this year, which is super disappointing. JavaOne is where I got started with presenting at conferences, and it’s a place where I always meet interesting people, whether they are speakers, engineers working on Java itself, Java Champions, Java User Group leaders, or attendees there to learn something new. Tickets are still available, so I recommend taking a look.\nThat’s all from me! Remember, February is short, and it’ll be spring soon.\nJava News\nFresh releases, future plans, and the inside story from the Java team.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Today, we’re introducing the JetBrains Console, which provides enhanced AI management and analytics for organizations, including new capabilities to manage, observe, and control AI usage and costs across teams.\nAI is no longer an experiment for most development teams. It’s becoming part of the core toolchain. As usage increases, so does the need for clarity. Leaders need to understand how AI is used, how it affects day-to-day work, and how to manage it responsibly in an organization.\nAs a first step, these new capabilities are designed to provide that clarity, with governance and observability built in from the start. We will continue to further develop AI governance functionalities to provide even greater transparency.\nCentralized AI governance across teams\nOrganizations can now use the JetBrains Console to manage AI usage and costs at the company or team level. In the AI settings section, you can:\nEnable AI on the organization or team level.\nControl access to AI tools and agents, including Junie, Claude Agent, and OpenAI Codex.\nManage a shared pool of AI Credits.\nSet default and per-user credit limits.\nConfigure data collection options.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce enabled, AI capabilities are available directly inside developers’ JetBrains IDEs, with no additional setup or workflow changes required. This makes it possible to roll out AI incrementally and avoid ungoverned usage.\n\n\n\n\nManaging AI Credits and licenses\nAs AI usage grows, visibility into licenses and consumption becomes critical.\nThe Users and licensing tab in the AI management section provides a single view of:\nLicense availability and assignment throughout the organization.\nIncluded AI Credit usage.\nRemaining top-up credits.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmins can assign licenses that include AI Credits, such as AI Pro, AI Ultimate, All Products Pack, and dotUltimate, to individual users. Access can be granted or restricted as needed, with changes taking effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\nFor teams or individuals with higher usage needs, additional AI Credit limits can be configured per user or applied in bulk. This allows organizations to support power AI users without removing default values in the company.\n\n\n\n\nObservability into AI usage and adoption\nAI adoption rarely looks the same across teams. Some developers integrate it deeply into their workflow, while others use it occasionally or not at all.\nThe console provides clear visibility into how AI is used throughout the organization, helping you understand adoption patterns and plan budgets better.\nTrack AI adoption and engagement over time\nThe Active AI users chart shows how many developers actively use AI, making it easier to understand adoption trends and engagement levels across teams. You can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nMonitor AI Credit consumption\nAI Credit usage can be analyzed over any time period, both for credits included in your AI license and top-up credits. This data supports more informed planning around budgets and usage limits.\n\n\n\n\nSpot when developers reach their AI Credit limits\nThe console also shows how frequently users reach their monthly AI Credit limits. This makes it easier to identify friction points and adjust limits where needed, whether at the team or individual level.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how AI influences development work\nBeyond usage and cost, the console provides early insights into how AI is used and received by developers. The AI activity and impact charts are intended to support comparison and informed decisions. \nIn upcoming releases, we will introduce more advanced metrics and API access to help organizations assess the impact of AI on engineering and business outcomes.\nAcceptance of AI-generated code\nThe AI-generated code and acceptance rate charts show how often AI-generated code is accepted by developers and act as indicators of quality and relevance.\nYou can use this data to compare the tools or agents you have integrated into AI Assistant (Junie, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and others that will be supported in the future). This helps you identify where suggestions consistently fall short of expectations and decide where configuration, enablement, or tool choice should be revisited. \nYou can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nAI-modified code\nThe AI-modified code charts highlight the relative footprint of different AI tools and features within the codebase.\nThis helps teams understand exactly where AI is making meaningful contributions to development.\n\n\n\n\nAI feature activity\nThe AI feature activity chart shows how developers interact with AI inside the IDE, including chat usage and suggestion volume.\nThese insights help distinguish experimentation from sustained use and identify mismatches between enabled capabilities and actual developer behavior.\n\n\n\n\nGet started\nAI management and analytics are now available at no additional cost to all commercial customers with AI licenses via the JetBrains Console. Access is role-based, allowing organizations to define who can manage AI settings, view usage and adoption data, and assign licenses. \nTo get started, open the AI management section in the JetBrains Console. For more details, refer to the documentation or visit the AI for Business page.\n\n\n\n    \nExplore JetBrains Console now\n                                                    \nWe’re working to further enhance AI management and governance capabilities for organizations. Upcoming features include:\nCentralized Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) management for AI providers.\nMCP management for your organization.\nCentralized codebase indexing (RAG).\nAI guardrails and AI audit.\nMore advanced usage analytics dashboards and API access.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to stay updated on what’s next?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from version 2026.1, IntelliJ-based IDEs will run natively on Wayland in supported desktop configurations. This follows Wayland’s ascendance to the position of primary display server across contemporary Linux distributions.\nBy making this change in our EAP releases first, we hope to be able to give more Linux users the opportunity to try the native Wayland mode in their IDE, gather their feedback, and prepare more comprehensively for the general rollout in one of the upcoming major versions.\nWhat changes?\nInstead of running as X applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs will now automatically enable native Wayland support in a Wayland-capable desktop environment.\n\n\n\n\nSince the last preview in 2024.2, we have enhanced stability across several Wayland server implementations, added drag-and-drop functionality and input methods (IMs) support, and made a significant step towards native-looking window decorations.\nWayland differs profoundly from X11 in several technical ways. As a result, even though the user interface should largely look and feel the same, these underlying distinctions may be noticeable:\nSome windows and dialogs, e.g. Project Structure and Alerts, may not be centered on the screen or keep their previous location. This is due to the window manager having total control over windows’ locations in Wayland, which it is not always possible to override on the application side.\nThe splash screen on IDE startup will not appear as it cannot be reliably centered on the screen.\nSome popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\nWindow decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme.\n\n\n\n\nSome of these distinctions affect many Wayland users across other applications, and the Wayland community is actively addressing them. It is possible that they will be resolved in future versions of Wayland implementations and IntelliJ-based IDEs.\nX11 is still supported\nIn a Linux desktop environment that does not support Wayland, IntelliJ-based IDEs will continue to work as X applications. It is also possible to switch to using X11 on any Wayland desktop because an X.Org implementation called XWayland is always available for compatibility with older applications. To do that, add -Dawt.toolkit.name=XToolkit to the VM options list (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…) and restart the IDE.\nIs my IDE running in X11 or Wayland mode?\nIf you are curious about which mode your IntelliJ-based IDE is currently running in, you can find out by going to the About dialog (Help | About) and checking which toolkit is in use. Click on the Copy and Close button, and you’ll then see the toolkit’s name towards the top of the copied text:\nToolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nThis information is also available in idea.log; for example:\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nConfigurations supported in the future\nWayland support for Remote Development mode is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, Remote Development mode will continue to operate as before and not enable native Wayland support automatically.\nTechnical details\nNative Wayland support is mostly concentrated in one subsystem called WLToolkit. If you were one of the early adopters of this mode, you had to specify the -Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit VM option manually. This will continue to work, but it is no longer necessary.\nThe launcher will supply a new option to the IDE: -Dawt.toolkit.name=auto. The “auto” option will be resolved into either WLToolkit or XToolkit based on the following rule:\nIf wl_display_connect() succeeds, “auto” is replaced with WLToolkit, and therefore the application is launched in the native Wayland mode.\nOtherwise, “auto” is replaced with XToolkit, and the application is launched in X11 mode.\nLike every other aspect of JetBrains Runtime, the platform that powers IntelliJ-based IDEs, WLToolkit is fully open-source. JetBrains is also a key contributor to the OpenJDK project Wakefield, which is dedicated to ensuring that all Java applications execute natively on Wayland. New features and fixes are regularly published to the project’s GitHub repository. \nFeedback\nWe are very grateful for the dedication and valuable input from our users who participated in the Wayland Preview program. The time and effort you invested in reporting issues were instrumental, not only in identifying critical bugs but also in helping us accurately prioritize the roadmap for improvements and the implementation of key features.\nWe are pleased to announce that the upcoming version 2026.1 incorporates fixes for a substantial number of the reported problems. These fixes address a wide range of stability, performance, and desktop integration issues, marking a major milestone in the maturity of our Wayland support.\nThis major platform transition is a work in progress. We are actively investigating and developing fixes, prioritizing core areas like rendering, popups, window management, input methods (IMs), and desktop integration. Please subscribe to and vote for relevant issues for updates. Your patience and feedback are crucial as we work toward a stable, performant, modern, and feature-complete experience.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR:\nThe Kotlin Foundation is launching a mentorship program that pairs experienced open-source maintainers with new Kotlin contributors to help them make their first meaningful contributions, with branded swag and a chance to win a trip to KotlinConf.\nI still remember my first contribution to an open-source library. It was Typhoon, a widely popular dependency injection framework for iOS apps. The easiest part was the actual change. Much harder, but still manageable, was everything that came with it – from onboarding to learning the project structure to figuring out how things were tested.\nWhat required the most effort in terms of emotional energy was something different – deciding that I was worthy of contributing at all. Typhoon was one of the most popular iOS libraries at the time. Most of the apps I knew depended on it. Folks from my community used it daily and considered it a very clever and complex project. I had to convince myself that I was good enough and that I wouldn’t make things worse.\nIronically, I actually did make things worse by introducing a pretty nasty bug. But the world didn’t end. I learned a lot and fixed it later myself!\nThe same thing still happens today to many people who want to make their first open-source contribution. In some ways, it has become even harder, as AI has made the picture worse. It’s now much easier to implement a change without deeply understanding the project and the problem being solved, which has led to a wave of low-quality PRs. As a result, many maintainers have become skeptical about reviewing contributions from outsiders.\nThat’s why we’re launching a new pilot program at the Kotlin Foundation – Kotlin Ecosystem Mentorship. We help experienced project maintainers team up with enthusiasts who want to make their first meaningful contribution, whether that’s code, documentation, or something else. Project maintainers act as mentors. They guide mentees through the full contribution journey – helping to set up the project and understand how the work is organized, reviewing changes, and giving feedback until a contribution is successfully merged. Mentees are expected to work on a real project, ask questions, respond to feedback, and gradually learn how to contribute independently.\nBy the end of the program, each mentor-mentee pair should have at least one meaningful contribution merged into a real project. Ideally, the project also gains a new regular contributor who continues picking up tasks in the future.\nWe’re starting with a small-scale pilot for roughly 10 pairs. It will run from mid-February, when mentor-mentee pairs will be formed, to the beginning of April. We expect it to be relatively lightweight, with mentors spending around 30–60 minutes per week, and mentees around 2–4 hours per week, depending on the task.\nThere’s no formal evaluation at the end. Instead, we’ll collect feedback from both sides. Every pair with a successfully merged meaningful contribution will receive a Kotlin-branded merchandise pack, and one randomly selected pair will win a trip to KotlinConf 2026, with all expenses covered.\nWe know that work on open-source projects is very demanding. The most important asset is people who are motivated to spend some of their time giving back to the ecosystem they rely on. We believe this program can help maintainers pass on not just knowledge but also confidence to a new generation of Kotlin open-source contributors!\nHow to apply\nIf you want to participate as a mentor, please complete this survey. You should be a maintainer of a Kotlin open-source project and be ready to spend some time working with a mentee.\nIf you want to participate as a mentee, please complete this survey.\nFAQ\nQ: What are the requirements for mentees?\nWe don’t impose any hard requirements beyond your willingness to contribute to a project. That said, the program is limited in size, so we unfortunately won’t be able to accept everyone this time.\nQ: Is this limited to code contributions?\nWe accept what we call meaningful contributions – anything that a project maintainer (acting as a mentor) considers valuable for their project. This can include documentation, tooling, examples, or other forms of contribution.\nQ: When will the pairs be formed?\nWe’ll get in touch with participants by February 16, 2026.\nQ: Where can I get more details?\nFeel free to contact us at hello@kotlinfoundation.org or join the #kotlin-foundation channel in the public Kotlin Slack.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We hope you’re staying up to date with our latest posts and have checked out our tutorials on how to create coding agents in Koog and connect ACP-compliant agents to your JetBrains IDE. As useful as these guides are, one important piece was hitherto missing from the puzzle: How do you make your Koog agent ACP-compliant in the first place?\nThis is where Koog’s native integration with the ACP comes into play, providing a streamlined path from agent implementation to IDE integration. Let’s review some basics first.\nWhat is the ACP?\nThe Agent Client Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that defines how agents and clients communicate. Its main uses include notifying the client about things like an LLM’s response or a tool call, or requesting permissions to edit a file. \nACP provides extensive documentation and SDKs for Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Rust, all of which fully implement the agent-client communication layer. As a result, developers don’t need to reimplement protocol logic; they can simply use the already-implemented notifications and request handlers.\nThis significantly reduces the effort required to integrate agents with clients and makes interoperability the default: Any ACP-compatible agent can be used with any ACP-compatible editor or client. Several existing coding agents already follow the ACP and can be easily connected with a wide range of clients, including AI Chat in JetBrains IDEs.\nSo if you want to build your own coding or code-related agent and connect it to an IDE, the first step is choosing an agent framework. And a perfect choice here is Koog.\nWhat is Koog?\nKoog is a Kotlin-based framework for building AI agents that targets JVM, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and in-browser applications. It’s suitable for any kind of agent and provides various ready-made components, including:\nMultiple agent strategies and execution patterns.\nSupport for various LLM providers.\nAgent tracing and state persistence.\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent2Agent protocol) integration.\nA feature mechanism to make the agent extensible.\nWhat’s more, our recent Koog blog post series walks through the entire process of building coding agents from prompt design to tool implementation, making it an excellent starting point for getting familiar with the framework. With that foundation in place, we can now take the next step: applying Koog’s agent-building capabilities to create an ACP-compliant agent.\nHow Koog and ACP work together?\nKoog x ACP integration is built on top of the ACP Kotlin SDK and implemented using Koog’s feature mechanism.\nThe Kotlin ACP SDK provides an API for defining an ACP-compatible agent and for declaring the logic of agent instantiation and execution. \nFirst is AgentSupport, which manages client-agent sessions:\nclass KoogAgentSupport: AgentSupport {\n\n    override suspend fun initialize(clientInfo: ClientInfo): AgentInfo {\n    \t// Client establishes connection with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun createSession(sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client creates a new interactive session with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun loadSession(\n        sessionId: SessionId,\n        sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters,\n    ): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client loads a previous interactive session with the agent\n    }\n}\nThe createSession method must return an AgentSession, which represents a single client-agent interaction. The session begins when the client sends a prompt request, triggering agent execution:\nclass KoogAgentSession(\n    override val sessionId: SessionId,\n) : AgentSession {\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Client sends prompt, agent starts execution and emits notification into the events flow, which are sent back to client\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        // Agent stops execution\n    }\nNow, let’s build a simple Koog coding agent that can read and edit files directly in your project from the IDE. The place to define and run the agent is the prompt method in AgentSession:\n    private var agentJob: Deferred<Unit>? = null\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Define config with agent prompt and model of your choice\n        val agentConfig = AIAgentConfig(\n            prompt = prompt(\"acp\") {\n                system(\"You are coding agent.\")\n            // NB: append client prompt\n            }.appendPrompt(content),\n            model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n            maxAgentIterations = 1000\n        )\n\n        // Register file system tools\n        val toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n            tool(::listDirectory.asTool())\n            tool(::readFile.asTool())\n            tool(::editFile.asTool())\n        }\n\n       // Implement your custom agent strategy\n       val strategy = strategy<Unit, Unit>(\"acp-agent\") {\n            val executePlan by subgraphWithTask<Unit, Unit> {\n                \"Execute the task.\"\n            }\n            nodeStart then executePlan then nodeFinish\n        }\n\n       // Combine everything and run\n       val agent = AIAgent<Unit, Unit>(\n            promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n            agentConfig = agentConfig,\n            strategy = strategy,\n            toolRegistry = toolRegistry,\n        ) {\n            // NB: add ACP feature\n            install(AcpAgent) {\n                this.sessionId = this@KoogAgentSession.sessionId.value\n                this.protocol = this@KoogAgentSession.protocol\n                this.eventsProducer = this@channelFlow\n                // To allow default notifications about basic llm and tool events\n                this.setDefaultNotifications = true\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // To make sure the agent is cancellable, wrap it in a job\n        agentJob = async { agent.run(Unit) }\n        agentJob?.await()\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        agentJob?.cancelAndJoin()\n    }\nHaving AgentSupport and AgentSession implemented, it becomes possible to execute a Koog agent in ACP mode. Try it using the terminal client – you can find an example implementation here.\nBut now let’s move on and try to connect this Koog coding agent to some ACP-capable client, for example, your IntelliJ-based IDE.\nHow to connect the Koog ACP agent to your IDE?\nAll IntelliJ-based IDEs support the ACP. This means you can connect any ACP-compatible agent and use it directly via the AI Chat.\nWhen a new AI Assistant chat is opened, the IDE instantiates the configured ACP agent and connects to it via the built-in ACP client using standard I/O transport. The client processes all notifications and requests emitted by the running agent, displaying them in the chat and reflecting permission requests directly in the IDE UI.\nAn ACP agent can be connected to the 25.3 version of IntelliJ-based IDEs via the ~/.jetbrains/acp.json config file, where the agent run command, arguments, and environment variables should be defined in JSON format:\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to create an agent executable is to package it as an application. To do this, we place the agent entry point in a separate AcpAgentKt file, where STDIO transport is initialized. This transport captures the process’s standard input and output streams and launches the agent connected to the transport, using the previously defined KoogAgentSupport.\nsuspend fun main() = coroutineScope {\n    val token = System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ?: error(\"OPENAI_API_KEY env variable is not set\")\n\n    val agentTransport = StdioTransport(\n        this, Dispatchers.IO,\n        input = BufferedInputStream(System.`in`).asSource().buffered(),\n        output = BufferedOutputStream(System.out).asSink().buffered(),\n        name = \"koog-agent\"\n    )\n\n    val promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(token)\n\n    try {\n        val agentJob = launch {\n            val agentProtocol = Protocol(this, agentTransport)\n\n            Agent(\n                agentProtocol,\n                KoogAgentSupport(\n                    protocol = agentProtocol,\n                    promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n                    clock = Clock.System,\n                )\n            )\n\n            agentProtocol.start()\n        }\n        agentJob.join()\n\n    } finally {\n        agentTransport.close()\n        promptExecutor.close()\n    }\n}\nUsing Gradle, configure the application entry point, then run the installDist task to generate the executable distribution in projectRoot/build/install/coding-agent/bin/coding-agent.\napplication {\n    mainClass = \"ai.coding.agent.AcpAgentKt\"\n}\nProvide this path in the IDE ACP configuration JSON – and voilà! You can now connect your Koog agent to the AI chat and send prompts directly from the UI…and let the agent code for you!\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nYou can find a complete example of the ACP × Koog coding agent here and use it as a template for building your own in-IDE and external assistants. You can implement an agent for any existing ACP-compatible client or build your own client using the ACP SDKs.\nWith the ACP, Koog, and just a few lines of code, you can connect your agent to your web page or desktop application, receive notifications about the agent lifecycle, and surface them directly in the UI.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When people think about tooling for Android development, the conversation often gravitates towards platform-specific concerns: UI performance, layout validation, device compatibility, or resource management. Yet for many Android teams, the most persistent challenges don’t sit at the platform level – they’re in the team’s Kotlin codebase itself.\nAs Android projects scale, Kotlin brings strong language features, but it doesn’t eliminate complexity. Null safety can still be misused, functions grow unchecked, architectural boundaries blur, and code style diverges across teams. This is where Qodana for Android becomes more relevant.\nQodana is not an Android framework tool, and it doesn’t aim to replace Android-specific tooling such as Android Lint. Instead, it focuses on Kotlin code quality, automation, and consistency, which are central concerns for modern Android development.\nIn the past, you might have seen Developer Advocate Anton Arhipov showing users how Qodana works with Kotlin to improve code quality for Android developers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQodana has advanced significantly since then, and the needs of Android developers have grown, too. \nKotlin as the common denominator in Android teams\nAt JetBrains, we’re proud of having created Kotlin. While Kotlin is a powerful, multi-purpose language used for backend development and for building cross-platform applications across mobile, desktop, and web, it’s also widely recognized as the primary language for Android development. That’s why bringing strong code quality tooling like Qodana to Android teams is so important.\nWithin these teams, Kotlin is also used beyond the mobile app itself. Shared libraries, test infrastructure, build tooling, and even backend services are increasingly written in the language.\nThis creates a need for consistent Kotlin standards across different parts of an organization. In practice, however, consistency is difficult to maintain. Local IDE inspections vary, CI checks are often incomplete, and code review standards depend heavily on individual reviewers.\nQodana for Android addresses this gap by allowing Android teams to enforce Kotlin inspections automatically and consistently in CI systems, using the same inspection engine that developers already rely on in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. This alignment is critical. When local feedback and automated checks disagree, developers lose trust in both.\nCreating a CI-first quality gate with code analysis\nMost issues that slow Android teams down are not catastrophic runtime failures. They are incremental quality regressions: overly complex methods, fragile null handling, unused code, or visibility issues that make refactoring harder over time.\nQodana runs Kotlin static analysis as part of the software development lifecycle, shifting quality checks earlier and making them repeatable. Rather than relying on manual code reviews to catch everything, teams can use Qodana as a quality gate that highlights high-impact issues before code is merged.\nThis is particularly valuable for Android projects with multiple modules, long-lived feature branches, or distributed teams. Automated analysis ensures that quality expectations don’t change depending on who reviews the pull request.\nWhat Qodana for Android is, and what it’s not\nIt is important to be precise about what Qodana does in an Android context.\nWhat Qodana for Android does:\nAnalyze Kotlin code used in Android projects\nAutomate Kotlin quality checks in CI\nAlign IDE inspections with automated enforcement\nSupport scalable quality management across teams\nAnalyze project layouts and resources\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Qodana for Android does not do:\nReplace Android Lint\nAnalyze device-specific behavior\nProvide Android framework diagnostics\nQodana can complement existing Android tooling rather than compete with it.\nAutomation and the reality of scale\nAs Android teams grow, review capacity does not scale linearly with team size. Kotlin helps reduce certain classes of errors, but it doesn’t replace the need for disciplined code structure and readability.\nQodana supports this reality through automation. By codifying Kotlin quality rules and running them consistently, teams can remove repetitive review comments and focus human attention on business logic and product decisions.\nThis is not about replacing developers’ judgment – it’s about reserving that judgment for where it adds the most value.\nKotlin quality beyond the Android boundary\nOne of the less obvious advantages of using Qodana in Android contexts is that it does not stop at the Android module boundary. Many Android teams share Kotlin code across mobile and non-mobile components, and maintaining consistent standards across those environments is often challenging.\nBecause Qodana operates at the language and project level, it allows teams to apply the same Kotlin inspections across shared libraries and supporting systems. This reduces fragmentation and helps organizations treat Kotlin as a strategic language rather than a platform-specific implementation detail.\nIn fact, the official Kotlin team even uses Qodana for internal quality and security. \n\n\n\n\nRead Case Study\nPractical quality check adoption for existing Android codebases\nOne of the biggest barriers to adopting stricter quality checks is existing technical debt. Many Android projects are years old, and introducing a new tool that flags thousands of issues is rarely productive.\nQodana is designed to support gradual adoption. Teams can baseline existing issues, focus on preventing new regressions, and incrementally tighten standards over time. This makes it viable for real-world Android projects rather than only greenfield applications.\nThe ability to configure inspections, tailor rulesets, and control enforcement levels is essential for long-term success.\nA Kotlin-centric view of Android development\nSeen through a Kotlin-first lens, Qodana for Android is less about the platform and more about discipline. It helps teams treat code quality as an automated, shared responsibility rather than a manual afterthought.\nFor Android teams working primarily in Kotlin, especially those operating at scale or across multiple domains, this focus is both practical and necessary. Quality issues compound quietly over time, and automation is one of the few reliable ways to keep them under control.\nIncrease quality and security with Qodana\nAndroid development today is as much about managing complexity as it is about building features. Kotlin provides powerful tools, but without consistent enforcement and automation, even well-intentioned teams drift.\nQodana for Android offers a way to bring Kotlin code quality into the foreground of the development process, embedding it into CI and aligning it with developers’ existing workflows. It is not an Android-specific analyzer, but for Kotlin-driven Android teams, that is precisely its strength.\nView Docs\nLet’s talk at KotlinConf 2026!\nJoin JetBrains for the most important Kotlin event of the year and find out how Qodana can help your team boost code quality – right from the source.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you use editor productivity extensions for Visual Studio 2026, there’s good news—they can now load faster! Extension developers with existing MEF-based editor productivity extensions should read this blog to learn about recent changes and how they might be affected. \nWe introduced VisualStudio.Extensibility to simplify the creation of Visual Studio extensions for developers. Previously, handling threads in VSSDK-based extensions was often difficult, requiring knowledge of thread affinity and even the ins and outs of COM just to avoid freezing Visual Studio. The new extensibility model abstracts these technical details away seamlessly. \nDespite this advancement, we recognize most Visual Studio extensions still use VSSDK, so we’re striving to make targeted improvements there as well – especially regarding performance. For Visual Studio 2026, we’ve added the ability to load MEF-based editor extensions on a background thread, which significantly speeds up startup times for users. A major highlight of Visual Studio 2026 is its improved performance, and the proposed change we’re making to MEF is just one of many enhancements planned to make it even faster. We hope you’ll be pleased with the results. \nWhat changed? \nVisual Studio editor components use the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), which requires that objects be constructed in a free-threaded manner. Despite official MEF guidelines, we’ve often loaded components on the UI thread, resulting in many extensions relying on this behavior and limiting our ability to enhance startup performance. \nWith Visual Studio 2026, we’re shifting to a free-threaded model, loading MEF components on background threads. This means extensions with UI thread dependencies might fail to load. We’ve been rigorously testing this approach in recent Visual Studio 2022 updates, and we are aware that some extensions that expect to load on the UI thread will fail to load with this optimization. To support extension developers through this transition, we’ve provided a setting and an analyzer that allows you to experiment with background loading and detect if your extension could be impacted by this change before we push it out more broadly. This initiative reflects our commitment to reducing disruptive changes and help extenders adapt when updates are necessary for the overall improvement of the product. \nDoes it impact my extension? \nTo help extension developers better detect if this change impacts you, we created an analyzer to identify potential issues. We hope that this will give you the opportunity to bring your extension in compliance with MEF rules, so that your extension can also get a startup performance boost like the rest of Visual Studio 2026. \nThe example below shows the analyzer running and reporting access to the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ThreadHelper  and DTE2.StatusBar require UI thread. \n \n To use the analyzer, add a reference to the latest version of the Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers package: \n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers\" Version=\"17.7.98\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\nTo validate your extension can adapt to this change, enable the Preview Feature flag “Initialize editor parts asynchronously during solution load”. \n \nWhen debugging, you may set a breakpoint in MEF part constructors and evaluate System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId. If it’s different than 1, then your code executes on the background thread.  \n \nCall to action \nLoading MEF parts on a background thread is essential for improving Visual Studio’s performance, and we have gradually enabled this change in Visual Studio 2026. We recognize that code changes can be inconvenient, so we’ve made it straightforward to spot and resolve any issues. To see examples of removing UI thread affinity, please see our documentation or a sample PR on how we made this change ourselves.  \nWe want to hear from you! \nThank you for sharing your issues and suggestions with us, and we hope you’ll keep providing feedback about what you like and what we can improve in Visual Studio. For those new and experienced to extending Visual Studio, we invite you to visit our documentation to learn more, or watch the video series on Visual Studio Toolbox where Visual Studio engineers take you through how to build extensions using our samples on GitHub. Feel free to share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones. If you want a closer engagement with other partners in the ecosystem, please visit our GitHub repo to report issues as well. \nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn. \nThe post Performance improvements to MEF-based editor productivity extensions appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "영상 편집 프로그램 하나 없어도 문제없어요! 이제는 웹 브라우저만으로도 감성 가득한 로파이 유튜브 채널을 만들 수 있는 시대입니다. AI와 무료 웹 앱을 활용해 단 수십 분 만에 프로급 영상을 제작하는 모든 과정을 지피티팍이 쉽고 자세하게 알려드립니다. 초보자도 바로 시작할 수 있는 감성 채널, 지금 바로 만들어보세요!\n여러분, 혹시 유튜브를 보다가 창가에서 비를 맞으며 공부하는 여학생과 함께 흘러나오는 차분한 로파이 음악 채널을 접해보신 적 있으신가요? 전 세계 수백만 명이 공부할 때나 일할 때, 또는 휴식할 때 틀어놓는 이른바 '로파이 걸' 스타일의 24시간 음악 채널 말이에요. 그런 영상을 보면서 '나도 저런 감성적인 음악 채널을 만들어보고 싶다'는 생각, 한 번쯤 해보셨을 겁니다.\n\n\n하지만 막상 시작하려고 하면 막막하게 느껴지는 게 사실이죠. 프리미어 프로나 애프터 이펙트 같은 무겁고 전문적인 프로그램을 배워야 할 것 같고, 영상 편집 경험도 필수적이며, 심지어 고사양 컴퓨터까지 필요할 거라고 지레짐작하게 됩니다. 솔직히 말씀드리면, 저도 처음엔 그랬습니다. 이런 고정관념 때문에 시작조차 못 해본 분들도 많으실 거예요.\n그런데 오늘, 제가 그 모든 고정관념을 완전히 깨드리겠습니다! 무거운 프로그램을 설치할 필요도 없고, 비싼 컴퓨터도 필요 없습니다. 오직 웹 브라우저 하나만 있으면 여러분도 감성 유튜브 채널의 주인이 될 수 있습니다. 2026년, 기술은 정말 놀랍도록 발전했거든요.\n오늘 이 포스트에서는 AI와 무료 웹 앱만을 활용해서, 영상 편집 경험이 전무한 초보자도 단 수십 분 만에 프로급 로파이 플레이리스트 영상을 만드는 방법을 알려드릴게요. 제가 직접 여러 방법들을 시도해보고 가장 효율적인 과정을 정리했으니, 끝까지 따라오시면 분명 여러분만의 감성 넘치는 음악 채널을 바로 시작하실 수 있을 거예요. 자, 그럼 시작해볼까요?\n✨ 웹 브라우저 기반 감성 채널, 핵심 6단계 로드맵\n강의에 들어가기 앞서, 오늘 우리가 배울 전체 과정을 간단히 소개해드릴게요. 총 6단계로 진행되는데, 생각보다 복잡하지 않으니 너무 걱정 마세요!\n1단계: 구글 제미나이로 로파이 감성 애니메이션 이미지 생성\n2단계: 그록 AI로 정지 이미지를 6초 애니메이션 영상으로 변환\n3단계: 제가 만든 '심리스 루프 스튜디오'로 짧은 영상을 무한 루프 영상으로 변환\n4단계: 역시 제가 만든 '스핀젠'으로 음악에 맞춰 회전하는 CD 영상 제작\n5단계: 'Suno 5.0 Generator GPTs'와 SUNO를 활용해 실제 로파이 음악 생성\n6단계: 업그레이드된 '스펙트럼 스튜디오 프로'에서 모든 요소를 합쳐 최종 영상 완성\n어때요? 이 모든 과정이 웹 브라우저에서 이루어지기 때문에 프로그램 설치가 전혀 필요 없습니다. 다만, 마지막 렌더링 단계에서는 쾌적한 작업을 위해 GTX 1050급 이상의 그래픽카드가 있으면 더욱 좋습니다. 그럼 지금부터 하나씩 차근차근 따라 해 볼까요?\n ️ 1단계: 구글 제미나이로 감성 이미지 만들기\n우리 영상의 배경이 될 첫 이미지를 만드는 단계입니다. 여기서는 구글의 AI인 제미나이(Gemini)를 사용할 거예요. 제미나이는 이미지 생성 능력이 꽤나 뛰어나서 이런 감성적인 배경 만들기에 제격입니다.\n  Tip! 제미나이 채팅창에서 기본 모드 대신 '사고 모드'를 선택하면, '나노바나나 프로'라는 더 강력한 모델을 사용할 수 있어서 훨씬 더 나은 이미지 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다. 이건 꼭 기억해두세요!\n프롬프트는 최대한 구체적이고 감성적으로 작성하는 것이 중요합니다. 예를 들어 이렇게 입력해 보세요:\n\"90년대 감성의 애니메이션 스타일. 따뜻한 분위기의 방 안에서 헤드셋을 끼고 공부하는 여학생의 낭만적인 장면. 필기 중. 16대9 비율\"\n잠시 기다리면 영상과 비슷한 감성적인 이미지가 생성될 겁니다. 마음에 드는 이미지가 나오면 바로 저장해주세요. 만약 한 번에 마음에 드는 이미지가 나오지 않는다면, 프롬프트의 세부 내용을 조금씩 바꿔가며 여러 번 시도해보세요. AI는 명령어를 어떻게 주느냐에 따라 천차만별의 결과물을 보여주니까요.\n  2단계: 정지 이미지를 움직이는 영상으로! 그록 AI 활용\n이제 우리가 만든 정지된 이미지를 살아 숨 쉬는 움직이는 영상으로 만들 차례입니다. 여기서 사용할 도구는 그록 AI(Grok AI)입니다. 그록은 X(구 트위터)에서 제공하는 AI인데요, 이미지를 영상으로 만들어주는 기능이 특히 강력해서 최근 인기를 얻고 있습니다. 무료 사용자도 하루에 6초 영상을 20개 정도 만들 수 있으니, 충분히 활용 가능합니다.\n그록 좌측 메뉴에서 '이미지'를 선택한 후, 제미나이에서 생성한 이미지를 업로드합니다. 그다음 채팅창에 이렇게 입력해 보세요.\n\"고정샷, 필기를 하다 잠시 생각에 잠긴다\"\n여기서 '고정샷'이라고 명시하는 것이 정말 중요해요! 카메라가 움직이면 나중에 영상을 무한 루프로 만들 때 어색해질 수 있거든요. 몇 번의 시도 후에 적합한 영상이 나오면, 우측 상단의 설정에서 '동영상 업스케일'을 선택하여 화질 개선을 진행합니다. 잠시 후에 필름 아이콘에 HD 표시가 뜨면 이제 저장하시면 영상 생성도 완료됩니다.\n⚠️ 주의! 생성된 영상이 항상 여러분이 원하는 대로 완벽하게 나오지 않을 수도 있다는 점을 명심하세요. AI가 아직은 완벽하게 인간의 의도를 이해하는 건 아니거든요. 만약 영상이 마음에 안 드신다면 프롬프트를 조금씩 바꿔가면서 다시 시도해보시면 됩니다. 제가 겪어본 바로는 보통 두세 번 정도 시도하면 꽤 괜찮은 결과물이 나오더라고요.\n  3단계: 6초 영상을 무한 루프로! 심리스 루프 스튜디오\n자, 이제 우리에게는 6초짜리 짧은 영상이 생겼습니다. 그런데 이 영상을 그냥 반복 재생하면 어떻게 될까요? 영상이 끝나는 지점에서 처음으로 돌아갈 때 '툭' 하고 끊기는 느낌이 들 겁니다. 이런 부자연스러운 끊김은 감성 채널의 몰입감을 크게 해치죠. 동일한 영상을 부드럽게 이어주려면 일반적으로 '크로스페이드' 같은 효과를 줘야 하는데, 캡컷 같은 비교적 쉬운 앱에서도 여러 단계를 거쳐야 하니 초보자에게는 당연히 엄두가 나지 않는 작업일 수밖에 없습니다.\n\n\n여기서 정말 유용한 앱이 바로 제가 직접 만든 '심리스 루프 스튜디오(Seamless Loop Studio)'입니다. 이 웹 앱은 무한 루프 영상을 아주 쉽게 만들어줍니다.\n앱을 실행한 후 무한 루프를 적용할 영상 소스를 업로드하고 '구간 분석 시작'을 클릭하면, 전체 구간에서 가장 자연스럽게 이어질 수 있는 끝 부분을 자동으로 찾아주는 '스마트 매칭' 기능이 바로 작동합니다. 그리고 다음 두 가지 옵션도 있습니다:\n강제 오버랩: 영상의 끝 1초 구간을 오버랩하고 크로스페이드를 강제 적용하는 방식입니다. 원본 영상이 스마트 매칭을 적용하기에 불안정한 경우에 사용하면 좋습니다.\n바운스: 영상이 끝까지 재생된 다음 다시 거꾸로 되감기면서 처음으로 돌아가는 걸 반복합니다. 영상 내에 상하좌우로의 명확한 움직임이 없는 고정된 장면에서 작은 움직임이 있을 때 특히 유용합니다.\n두 번째 단계에서 그록 AI로 만든 영상으로 직접 작업해볼게요. 해당 영상을 업로드한 후 '구간 분석 시작'을 클릭합니다. 영상처럼 스마트 매칭으로는 매우 짧은 구간 반복 재생이 되어 적합하지 않을 때가 많습니다.\n이번엔 '강제 오버랩'을 적용해보니, 영상의 끝부분과 시작 부분이 부드럽게 겹쳐지면서 끊김 없는 화면 전환이 이루어집니다. 나쁘지 않은데요?\n마지막으로 '바운스'를 적용해보니, 필기하던 학생이 고개를 들었다가 다시 숙이는 동작이 화면 오버랩도 없이 정말 자연스럽게 반복되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 음, 제 생각엔 이 '바운스' 기능이 이번 영상에는 가장 좋겠네요! '렌더링 시작'을 클릭하면 잠시 후 영상으로 저장됩니다. 정말 놀랍도록 간편하죠?\n\n \n심리스 루프 스튜디오\n \nseamless-loop-studio.vercel.app\n\n \n  4단계: 회전하는 감성 CD 이미지 추가! 스핀젠\n이 단계는 필수는 아니지만, 영상의 완성도를 높이고 감성을 살리는 데 아주 큰 도움이 됩니다. 단순히 배경 영상만 있는 것보다 음악과 어울리는 회전하는 CD 이미지가 있다면 훨씬 더 전문적인 느낌을 줄 수 있거든요.\n\n\n이런 작업을 직접 하려면 포토샵 같은 프로그램으로 앨범 커버를 만들고, 영상 편집 앱으로 회전 기능을 추가하는 등 여러 단계를 거쳐야 하는데, 여간 귀찮은 작업이 아닙니다. 하지만 걱정 마세요! 이 모든 작업을 이번에도 제가 만든 '스핀젠(SpinGen)'이라는 웹 앱이 단번에 해결해줍니다.\n앱을 실행한 후, 앨범 제목, 아티스트 이름, 세부 정보를 우리가 오늘 작업할 '공부할 때 듣기 편한 로파이 음악'과 관련된 내용으로 입력합니다. '비주얼 스타일 프롬프트'에도 관련 내용을 입력하고 'AI 추천'을 클릭하면 CD 디자인을 위한 프롬프트가 자동으로 생성됩니다. 이제 바로 '디자인 생성하기'를 클릭하기만 하면 됩니다!\n잠시 후 CD 디자인 작업이 완료됩니다. 디자인이 마음에 든다면 하단의 'GIF 버튼'을 클릭하여 변환을 시작하고, 이어서 '다운로드' 버튼을 클릭하면 회전하는 CD GIF 파일이 저장됩니다. 정말 쉽죠? 이 작은 디테일 하나가 영상의 분위기를 확 살려줄 거예요.\n\n \nSpinGen - AI Vinyl Studio\n \nspin-gen.vercel.app\n\n \n  5단계: 나만의 로파이 음악 만들기! SUNO 5.0 Generator GPTs\n영상은 거의 다 준비되었는데, 가장 중요한 것이 빠졌죠? 바로 음악입니다. 감성 로파이 채널에 맞는 음악이 없다면 앙꼬 없는 찐빵이니까요. 여기서는 제가 이전에 무료로 배포했던 'Suno 5.0 Generator GPTs'와 SUNO를 활용할 겁니다.\n'Suno 5.0 Generator GPTs'에서 이렇게 입력해 보세요:\n\"공부할 때 좋은, 집중력 향상에 도움되는 차분하고 정적이면서 감성적인 로파이 연주곡. 실제 집중력 향상 임상 연구 결과를 기반으로 해\"\n이렇게 입력하시면 GPTs가 SUNO에 최적화된 프롬프트를 자동으로 생성해줍니다. 생성된 프롬프트를 복사하셔서 SUNO에 붙여넣고 음악을 여러 개 만드시면 됩니다. 이 과정을 통해 여러분의 영상에 딱 맞는 분위기의 로파이 음악을 쉽게 얻을 수 있을 거예요.\n\n \nChatGPT\nChatGPT가 답변을 듣고, 영감을 얻고, 생산력을 높이는 데 도움을 드립니다.\nchatgpt.com\n\n \n  6단계: 모든 재료를 하나로! 스펙트럼 스튜디오 프로\n드디어 마지막 단계입니다! 지금까지 만든 모든 재료들, 즉 배경 영상, 회전 CD 이미지, 그리고 로파이 음악을 하나로 합쳐서 최종 영상을 완성할 차례입니다. 여기서 사용할 도구는 '스펙트럼 스튜디오 프로(Spectrum Studio Pro)'입니다. 이 앱은 제가 이전에 소개했던 스펙트럼 스튜디오의 업그레이드 버전인데요, 동영상 배경과 GIF 스티커 추가 및 파티클 개별 설정, 그리고 기타 오류를 개선한 아주 강력한 도구입니다.\n\n\n \n이제 차근차근 따라 해보세요:\n첫 화면에서 SUNO에서 생성한 음악 파일을 모두 등록합니다. 이때 타임라인을 복사해서 저장하는 것을 잊지 마세요!\n배경 미디어에 '심리스 루프 스튜디오'로 생성한 루프 영상을 업로드합니다.\n채널 로고와 '스핀젠'에서 만든 CD 회전 파일도 등록하고, 영상 반복수와 음질을 선택한 후 다음 단계로 넘어갑니다.\n오디오 스펙트럼을 선택합니다. 이번 작업에서는 '미니 막대'를 선택하고 화면 왼쪽 하단에 배치해 볼 거예요.\n채널 로고를 우측 하단에 적당한 크기로 배치하고, 로고의 배경을 지우고 그림자 효과를 적용해서 더욱 돋보이게 만듭니다.\n회전하는 CD를 왼쪽 미니 스펙트럼 위에 적절하게 배치하고, 여기에도 그림자 효과를 적용하여 입체감을 더합니다.\n그다음 빛 반사 조명 효과를 위해 '클럽 조명'을 추가합니다. 로파이 감성을 한층 더 끌어올려 줄 겁니다.\n마지막으로 스타일 파티클을 추가하면 되는데요. 이번 예시에서는 '파편' 효과를 적용해볼게요. (나중에 하트 같은 다른 효과도 추가할 수 있습니다.)\n모든 설정이 완료되면 상단에 '비디오 내보내기'를 클릭하고 다음 화면에서 렌더링을 시작하면 끝입니다!\n이 모든 과정을 통해 완성된 영상을 유튜브에 업로드하면, 여러분만의 멋진 로파이 감성 채널이 탄생하는 거죠! 생각해보니 정말 쉽지 않나요?\n \n[이 앱은 제 유튜브 채널 멤버십 가입시 사용가능 합니다. 아래 링크를 방문하세요]\n\n \nGPT PARK의 AI팩트\n가장 빠르고 알찬 AI 정보를 공개합니다. 유용한 AI 인사이트 : https://muzbox.tistory.com/category/AI%2C%20미래기술 블로그 수익화 인사이트 : https://smart-it-life.tistory.com/category/블로그%20수익화 유용한 자료\nwww.youtube.com\n\n \n  핵심 요약\n✅ 전문 프로그램 없이 웹 브라우저만으로 모든 영상 제작이 가능!\n✅ AI와 무료 웹 앱 조합으로 누구나 프로급 감성 영상 제작 가능!\n✅ 심리스 루프 스튜디오로 끊김 없는 배경 영상 쉽게 구현!\n✅ Suno로 나만의 로파이 음악을 생성하여 저작권 걱정 없이 활용!\n오늘 소개된 모든 툴은 초보자도 쉽게 접근할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 포기하지 말고 도전해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 정말 영상 편집 초보자도 감성 채널을 만들 수 있나요?\nA1: 네, 물론입니다! 오늘 소개된 모든 단계는 영상 편집 경험이 전혀 없는 분들도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 웹 브라우저 기반의 AI 및 무료 앱으로 구성되어 있습니다. 직관적인 인터페이스와 AI의 도움으로 전문적인 기술 없이도 멋진 결과물을 만들 수 있습니다.\nQ2: 마지막 렌더링 단계에 고사양 그래픽카드가 꼭 필요한가요?\nA2: GTX 1050급 이상의 그래픽카드가 있으면 렌더링 속도가 훨씬 빨라지고 쾌적하게 작업할 수 있지만, 필수는 아닙니다. 사양이 조금 낮더라도 시간이 더 오래 걸릴 뿐, 렌더링은 가능합니다. 다만, 작업의 효율성을 위해서는 권장 사양을 고려하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ3: '심리스 루프 스튜디오'나 '스핀젠'은 계속 무료로 사용할 수 있나요?\nA3: '심리스 루프 스튜디오'와 '스핀젠'은 2월 28일까지는 무료로 배포될 예정입니다. 그 이후에는 멤버십 가입을 통해 계속 이용하실 수 있습니다.

NHN Cloud NCUI개발팀 이진우입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n저는 매주 30여 개의 Web, Frontend, Design, Design System 등의 기술 뉴스레터를 살피고 동료들에게 공유해 왔는데요. 작년에 이어 올해도 개인적으로 인상 깊었던 아티클을 주제별로 공유드리고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 작년에 공유했던 2024년의 프론트엔드 뉴스 모음은 아래 경로에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\r\r\n>  [2024 프론트엔드 뉴스 한 방에 몰아 보기](https://meetup.nhncloud.com/posts/390)\r\r\n\r\r\n관심사와 조직 내 영향력이 큰 기술 스택을 중심으로 정리한 내용이기에 프론트엔드 생태계 전체를 대변한다고 보기는 어렵지만, 흥미가 가는 주제가 있다면 함께 첨부한 링크들이 출발점으로서 작은 도움이 되기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 본문의 링크들은 과거 시점 기준의 자료이므로 변경된 내용이 있을 수 있습니다.  \r\r\n\r\r\n## Node.js의 TypeScript 지원\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 초 Node.js는 Bun, Deno와 같은 경쟁자들에게 대적하기 위해 TypeScript 파일 실행 지원을 추가했습니다. 개발자 경험을 향상시키는 것이 주 목적이었기에 타입 체크, 컴파일이 아닌 타입을 걷어내는 것(Type Stripping)으로 방향을 잡았는데요. 이를 위해 SWC를 기반으로 한 Amaro가 핵심 도구로 기대 받았고, TypeScript 측에서도 관련 플래그를 추가했으며 최근 v24.12 버전에서 안정화 단계에 들어서게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Type Stripping 개념과 구현\r\r\n\r\r\nNode.js가 채택한 Type Stripping 방식의 원리와 구현 배경을 다룹니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Node.js now supports TypeScript by default](https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-is-coming-to-node-23)\r\r\n* [Everything you need to know about node.js type stripping](https://satanacchio.hashnode.dev/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nodejs-type-stripping)\r\r\n* [The Summer I Shipped Type Stripping](https://satanacchio.hashnode.dev/the-summer-i-shipped-type-stripping)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 생태계 지원 현황\r\r\n\r\r\nTypeScript 5.8의 플래그 추가, Amaro 1.0 릴리스, Node.js 안정화 버전 등 생태계 전반의 지원 현황입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Announcing TypeScript 5.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/#the---erasablesyntaxonly-option)\r\r\n* [Node.js Moves Toward Stable TypeScript Support with Amaro 1.0](https://socket.dev/blog/node-js-moves-toward-stable-typescript-support-with-amaro-1-0)\r\r\n* [Node.js v24.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.12.0)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 런타임 간 비교\r\r\n\r\r\nDeno와 Node.js의 TypeScript 지원 비교입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Node just added TypeScript support. What does that mean for Deno?](https://deno.com/blog/typescript-in-node-vs-deno)\r\r\n\r\r\n## React 2025 회고\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 React를 보면 프론트엔드의 인프라라고 불러야 할 만큼 범위가 넓어졌습니다. LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `<Activity />` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등 v19에서 도입된 주요 기능들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/3-ways-to-build-forms-in-react)\r\r\n* [Building Reusable Components with

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Rust 전환 시 기존 대비 10-100배의 성능 향상이 가능하기 때문에, 복잡해진 프론트엔드 생태계에서 이 흐름은 이제 거스르기 어려워 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n가장 두드러진 성과를 내는 곳은 VoidZero로 보입니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다. '이게 좋다' 하면 모두가 몰려가고, '저게 정답이다' 하면 또 그쪽으로 쏠리는 흐름이 반복됐습니다. 그 와중에 인상 깊었던 LLM 사용 사례와 아티클, 도구를 정리해 공유합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI 코딩의 한계와 책임\r\r\n\r\r\nLLM 기반 개발의 한계점과 개발자 책임에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to \"write better code?\"](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)\r\r\n* [Why you shouldn't use AI to write documentation](https://zeroheight.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-documentation/)\r\r\n* [Why Your AI Coding Assistant Keeps Doing It Wrong, and How To Fix It](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)\r\r\n* [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\r\r\n* [dead framework theory](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/)\r\r\n* [How to Fix Any Bug](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기업 도입 사례\r\r\n\r\r\nSpotify, Airbnb 등 대규모 조직의 AI 도입 경험입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1,500+ PRs Later: Spotify’s Journey with Our Background Coding Agent (Part 1)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/spotifys-background-coding-agent-part-1)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b)\r\r\n\r\r\n### MCP와 컨텍스트 엔지니어링\r\r\n\r\r\nModel Context Protocol과 효과적인 AI 활용을 위한 컨텍스트 설계입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [MCP explained without hype of fluff](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/12/mcp-explained-without-hype-or-fluff)\r\r\n* [Chrome DevTools MCP Server](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp)\r\r\n* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\r\r\n* [Minification isn't obfuscation - Claude Code proves it](https://martinalderson.com/posts/minification-isnt-obfuscation-claude-code-proves-it/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI시대의 개발 방법론\r\r\n\r\r\nAPI 설계, 문서화, 추상화 등 AI와 함께하는 개발 방법론입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Design APIs for an AI World ](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world)\r\r\n* [Writing documentation for AI: best practices](https://docs.kapa.ai/improving/writing-best-practices/)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Conversation: LLMs and Building Abstractions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html)\r\r\n* [Attention Is the New Big-O](https://alexchesser.medium.com/attention-is-the-new-big-o-9c68e1ae9b27/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 유용한 도구\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 개발에 활용할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) - 전체 Repository를 AI 친화적인 단일 파일로 압축\r\r\n* [repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt) - GitHub Repository를 단일 텍스트로 변환, GUI 기반으로 파일 선택 가능\r\r\n* [ai-digest](https://github.com/khromov/ai-digest) - 코드베이스를 하나의 마크다운 파일로 생성\r\r\n* [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) - Claude 기반 AI 에이전트를 여러 개 연결해 협업, 복잡한 작업을 단계별 워크플로우로 자동화\r\r\n* [agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules) - Cursor, Claude Code 같은 AI 코드 어시스턴트에게 일관된 행동 지침을 적용하는 규칙 템플릿 모음\r\r\n* [Conductor](https://conductor.build/) - Claude Code를 여러 개 동시에 실행하며 관리하는 도구\r\r\n* [Terragon](https://www.terragonlabs.com/) - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex 등 AI 코딩 에이전트를 클라우드에서 병렬 실행\r\r\n* [react-grab](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) - 페이지의 모든 요소를 선택해 AI 코딩 에이전트에게 컨텍스트로 전달, 단일 스크립트 태그로 설치\r\r\n* [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) - GitHub에서 다양한 MCP 서버를 모아둔 레지스트리\r\r\n* [streamdown](https://streamdown.ai/) - AI Chat 서비스처럼 마크다운 스트리밍 렌더링 지원\r\r\n* [lean-spec](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec) - 경량 SDD(Spec-Driven Development) 프레임워크\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그 외 분야별 소식\r\r\n\r\r\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년도 JavaScript와 TypeScript 생태계는 활발하게 움직였습니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "침몰하는 일본 경제에 대한 비판을 소신 있게 하는 것으로 유명한 일본의 경제학자 노구치 유키오의 “일본이 선진국에서 탈락하는 날”을 작년말에 매우 흥미롭게 읽었다. 한때 전 세계 최강국이었던 일본이 어떤 내, 외적 요소 때문에 침몰하고 있는지, 그리고 일본의 정치인과 기업인이 어떻게 연속적으로 잘못된 결정을 하면서 이 실수가 차곡차곡 쌓여서 일본이 선진국에서 탈락했는지에 대한 다소 주관적이지만, 나는 어느 정도 공감했던, 그런 분석이 주된 내용이다.\n흥미롭게 읽긴 했지만, 한편으로는 바짝 긴장하면서 읽었다. 왜냐하면, 일본이 갔던 이 내리막길을 한국이 그대로 갈 수도 있다고 생각했기 때문이다. 하지만, 책을 다 읽고 덮은 후 내 개인적인 생각을 좀 공유하자면, 한국은 일본같이 쉽게 선진국에서 탈락하진 않을 것 같다.(물론, 한국이 현재 선진국인가에 대해서는 찬반이 갈리지만). 하지만, 우리는 일본과는 여러 가지 면에서 같기도 하지만 시스템 자체가 다르고, 정치인들도 병신도 많지만, 꽤 괜찮은 사람도 있고, 가장 중요한 건, 일본인과 한국인은 근본적으로 다르기 때문에 – 물론, 한국인이 모든 면에서 월등하다고 생각한다 – 오히려 한국의 장래는 밝다고 생각한다.\n이 책을 재미있게 읽었던 또 다른 이유는 저자인 노구치씨가 한국에 대한 이야기를 상당히 많이 했는데, 모두 다 한국을 칭찬하는 긍정적인 내용이었고, 평소의 내 생각과 크게 다르지 않았기 때문이다. 한국이 어떻게 일본을 상대적으로 단기간에 따라잡았으며, 일단 선진국의 반열에 오르면 – 책이 써진 시점에는 아직 안 올랐지만, 지금은 이미 우리는 선진국이라고 생각한다 – 왜 일본같이 쉽게 탈락하지 않을지에 대한 노구치씨의 생각을 한번 정리해 보면 다음과 같다.\n이 분은 한국의 성장에 크게 기여한 사건으로 1990년대 말 아시아통화 위기를 손꼽는다. 흔히 우리가 말하는 IMF 사건이다. 1997년도에 태국의 바트가 폭락하면서 한국을 비롯한 아시아 각국의 통화도 폭락했는데, 이때 한국의 재벌 기업이 줄지어 도산하고 금융 시스템이 붕괴하면서 우리나라는 거의 망할뻔했다. 어쩔 수 없이 IMF의 도움을 받아야 했는데, 그 대가로 IMF의 깐깐한 관리 체제하에 놓이게 됐다.\n일본도 이때 큰 경제위기를 겪었지만, 이 위기 상황에 대처하는 방식이 한국과는 판이했다. 노구치씨의 의견에 의하면 이때 한국은 뼈와 살을 깎는 노력으로 체질을 완전히 개선하는 동시에 탄탄한 기초체력을 만든 반면, 일본은 눈앞에 보이는 위기에만 대처하느라 선진국과는 점점 더 멀어졌다는 것이다. 한국은 IMF 관리를 계기로 경제인과 정치인뿐만 아니라 전 국민 사이에 강한 위기의식이 생겼다. IMF 관리 체제를 벗어나기 위해서는, 기업은 돈을 벌어서 수익성과 생산성을 개선해야 하고, 정부와 기업은 빠른 글로벌화를 해야지만 이 위기를 극복할 수 있다는 데 동의했다. 그리고 위기 극복의 열쇠는 한국인 전원의 인적 능력 향상이라는 점에도 동의했다. 이 점에 착안하여 좋은 인재를 배출하는 대학교의 교육, 연구 능력과 학생 전원의 영어 실력을 갈고닦는데 한국 정부, 기업, 학교는 집중적으로 투자했다. 이 모든 것을 한국인 특유의 앞만 보고 밀어붙이는 방식으로 했기 때문에 단시간 내에 글로벌화의 발판을 만들 수 있었고, 졸업하기 어렵다는 IMF의 관리에서 조기졸업 하는 놀라운 성과를 만들어냈다.\n아마도 이런 위기의식과 애국심 때문에 온 국민이 나라 살리기 운동의 하나로 그 유명한 금 모으기 운동까지 한 게 아닐까 생각한다. 지금 생각해 보면 정말 한국이기에 할 수 있었고, 한국만이 할 수 있는, 개인적으로도 너무 뿌듯하고 자랑스러운 운동이라고 생각한다.\n노구치씨는 글로벌화에 있어서 가장 중요한 영어에 대해서도 한국을 칭송한다. 이 분과 비슷한 세대 한국인들의 영어 실력은 정말 형편없었지만, 지금은 상황이 완전히 바뀌었다고 한다. TOEFL 점수를 보면 한국은 아시아 국가 중 10위 안인데, 이는 영어를 공용어로 사용하는 홍콩과 거의 비슷한 수준이다. 물론, 시험 점수가 그렇다는 것이고, 실제 영어를 일상생활에서 구사하는 실력은 홍콩이 한국보다 훨씬 높다. 일본은 아시아 29개국 중 27위로 거의 꼴찌인데 일본 정부, 기업 또는 국민들은 크게 개의치 않는 것 같다. 그만큼 일본은 글로벌화에 대해서는 크게 신경 쓰지 않거나 포기했다는 게 이 분의 주장이다.\n책을 다 읽고 생각해 봤는데, 실은 한때 미국보다 더 잘 살던 세계 최강국 일본과 우리가 비교당하는 것 자체가 대단한 영광이라고 생각한다. 한국은 한때 세계에서 가장 가난한 나라였는데 이젠 전 세계의 문화에 영향을 미치는 global cultural power가 됐다. 이 작은 나라가 전 세계에서 가장 좋은 차를 만들고, 가장 좋은 가전제품을 만들고, 가장 좋은 배를 만들고, 가장 좋은 핸드폰을 만들고, 가장 좋은 반도체를 만들고, 가장 좋은 화장품을 만들고, 가장 좋은 콘텐츠를 만든다는 사실을 우리 모두 잘 알고 있지만, 이게 의미하는 바를 곰곰이 생각해 보면 정말 엄청나다.\n우리는 여기서 과연 어디까지 더 올라갈 수 있을까?\n많은 분이 한국은 이제 끝났고, 일본과 같이 선진국에서 탈락할 것이라고 말하지만, 내 생각은 그 반대다. 나는 한국은 이제 막 시작했고, 훨씬 더 높이 오를 수 있다고 믿고 있다. 물론, 쉽진 않을 것이다. 그 어느 때보다 우리 앞에는 도전적이고 복잡한 장애물과 과제가 놓여 있고, 하나라도 잘못되면 우린 한 방에 다시 최빈국이 될 수도 있을 것이다. 하지만 과거가 미래에 대한 힌트를 줄 수 있다면, 우린 이미 수많은 어려움을 극복했고, 그 어려움으로부터 배움을 얻는 과정을 너무 많이 겪어서, 점진적 개선에 최적화된 민족이다. 내 이전 세대가 열심히 일했듯이, 우리 세대도 열심히 일하고 있고, 우리 다음 세대도 열심히 일할 것이라고 나는 믿는다. 우리 그 누구도 한국이 일본처럼 선진국에서 탈락하는 걸 보고 싶지도 않고, 경험하고 싶지도 않을 것이다. 그러려면 정말 열심히 일해야 하고, 여기에서 더 높이 올라가고 싶다면 더욱더 열심히 일해야 한다.\n이 글을 읽고 또 여러 가지 부정적인 댓글이 많이 달릴 건데 나는 상관없다. 열심히 일하기 싫으면 하지 말아라. 그건 본인의 자유다. 대신, 주변에 열심히 살려고 하는 사람들을 욕하지 말고, 이들을 방해하지 말았으면 한다.",

달하는 경제 파급 효과를 일으키는 지상 최대 스포츠 이벤트죠.\n단일 경기 중계권료와 광고비만으로 천문학적인 수익을 올리는 머니 메이커, 슈퍼볼은 어떻게 전 세계 팝스타들이 서고 싶어 하는 꿈의 무대이자, 자본주의의 꽃이 될 수 있었을까요?\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0

코치 월터 캠프가 스크리미지 라인*과 다운 시스템** 같은 현대적 규칙을 정립하며 본격적인 틀을 갖추게 됩니다.\n*공격과 수비 팀이 대치하는 가상의 선\n** 공격팀이 4번의 기회 안에 10야드(약 9m) 이상 전진해야 공격권을 유지하는 규칙\n흥미로운 점은 아메리칸 풋볼이 보여주는 철저한 포지션 분화입니다. 각자의 역할이 명확히 나뉘고 전술적 협업이 필수적인 이 종목은 미국을 세계 최고의 산업 강대국으로 키운 분업화의 상징으로 자리 잡으며 미국인의 정체성에 깊이 스며들었습니다.\n대학 풋볼의 인기가 높아지면서 1920년에는 프로 리그가 탄생했고, 1922년부터는 NFL이라는 이름을 사용하게 됩니다. 본격적인 전환점은 1960년대였습니다. 1960년 AFL(아메리칸 풋볼 리그)이라는 경쟁 리그가 등장하며 치열한 선수 영입 경쟁이 벌어졌고, 결국 1966년 NFL과 AFL은 합병에 합의하게 됩니다. 이 합병의 결과로 1967년, 첫 슈퍼볼이 열렸습니다.\n슈퍼볼이라는 명칭은 1968년 2회 대회부터 사용됐습니다. 캔자스시티 치프스의 구단주 라마 헌트가 딸이 가지고 놀던 탱탱볼(Super Ball)에서 영감을 받아, Ball과 발음이 비슷한 Bowl을 붙여 사발 모양 경기장을 표현한 것이죠. 이 재치 있는 제안은 그대로 받아들여졌고, 지금은 세계에서 가장 유명한 스포츠 이벤트 이름이 됐습니다.\n\n미국 대학 스포츠에서도 최고의 인기를 자랑하는 대학 풋볼 리그 / 사진: Reuters\nNFL이 추구하는\n최대 다수의 최대 행복\nNFL이 압도적인 인기를 유지할 수 있었던 비결은 평등에 기초한 리그 설계에 있습니다. 1994년부터 시행된 하드 샐러리캡(연봉 총액 상한제)은 특정 부자 구단이 우수한 선수를 독점하지 못하도록 원천적으로 차단했습니다.\n엄격한 전력 균형 덕분에 팬들은 “우리 팀도 언제든 우승할 수 있다”는 희망을 품게 됐고, 실제로 하드 샐러리캡 도입 이후 슈퍼볼 3연패를 달성한 팀은 단 한 곳도 나오지 않았습니다. 철저한 하드 샐러리캡 시스템은 팬층의 고른 분포로 이어졌고, 2025년 기준 리그 전체 티켓 판매율 97.6%라는 놀라운 기록을 만들어냈습니다.\n2025년 홈구장 평균 관중 1위 팀은 댈러스 카우보이스로 약 9만 3,000명을 기록했고, 최하위 시카고 베어스도 약 5만 8,000명을 기록했습니다. 하지만 댈러스의 홈구장 수용 인원이 10만 명, 시카고가 6만 2,500명이라는 점을 감안하면 두 팀 모두 경기장을 거의 가득 채운 셈입니다. 격차는 팬덤의 차이라기보다 경기장 규모의 차이에서 비롯된 결과였죠.\n\n평균 관중 1위 팀 댈러스 카우보이스가 홈구장으로 사용하는 AT&T 스타디움 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\n슈퍼볼 광고비가\n천문학적으로 오르는 이유\n슈퍼볼의 가치를 가장 직관적으로 보여주는 지표는 단연 광고비입니다. 1967년 첫 대회 당시 4만 달러 수준이었던 30초 광고비는, 2025년 평균 800만 달러(약 117억 5,000만 원)까지 치솟았습니다. 총 광고시간이 약 51분에 달한다는 점을 고려하면 전체 광고비는 1조 2,000억 원에 이릅니다.\n2025년 슈퍼볼 시청자 수는 1억 2,771만 명이었습니다. 이는 1967년 2,443만 명에 비해 약 6배 가까이 늘어난 수치죠. 단일 경기로는 UEFA 챔피언스리그 결승전에 이어 두 번째로 많은 시청자를 기록한 이벤트이기도 합니다.\n\n하지만 단순히 시청자 수만으로는 슈퍼볼 광고비의 비밀을 설명하기 어렵습니다. 챔피언스리그 결승전보다 시청자는 적지만, 광고비는 훨씬 비싸기 때문이죠. 슈퍼볼 광고가 비싼 진짜 이유는 시청자들이 광고를 집중해서 찾아본다는 점에 있습니다. 일반 스포츠 경기에서는 광고 시간에 자리를 비우는 경우가 많지만, 오히려 슈퍼볼에서는 광고만 보기 위해 TV 앞에 앉는 사람들도 적지 않을 정도죠.\n슈퍼볼 광고가 주목받기 시작한 건 리들리 스콧 감독이 연출한 애플의 '1984' 광고를 선보인 1984년부터입니다. 조지 오웰의 소설을 모티브로 IBM 독점 시장에 도전장을 내민 이 광고는 단순한 제품 홍보를 넘어 하나의 예술 작품으로 평가받았고, 이후 슈퍼볼 광고는 기업들이 창의성과 사회적 메시지를 겨루는 격전장이 되었습니다.\n\n역사상 가장 영향력 있는 광고로 평가받는 애플의 1984 광고 스틸컷\n슈퍼볼 광고가 이처럼 특별해진 데는 구조적 요인도 작용했습니다. 먼저 시청자 대부분이 미국인이라는 점입니다. 참여하는 60여 개 업체에게 슈퍼볼은 미국 시장을 공략할 수 있는 1년에 단 한 번뿐인 골든타임이죠. 게다가 하프타임이 약 30분으로 길어 광고 시간도 충분합니다. 무엇보다 광고 자체가 문화적 이벤트가 되었습니다. 슈퍼볼 다음날 언론과 소셜미디어에서 '올해 최고의 슈퍼볼 광고'로 회자되면 그 자체로 엄청난 추가 홍보 효과를 얻으니까요.\n이런 환경 속에서 광고주들은 더 화려한 스케일과 더 높은 실험성으로 시청자들의 기억에 남기 위해 경쟁합니다. 영상미가 떨어지거나 스토리가 부족한 광고는 금세 잊히기 때문에, 기업들은 수백억 원을 투자해서라도 최고의 작품을 만들려고 합니다. 그 결과 광고의 완성도는 계속 높아지고, 시청자들의 집중도 역시 함께 올라가게 됩니다. 그리고 이 흐름은 지속적인 광고비 상승으로 이어지고 있습니다.\n전 세계가 열광하는\n슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼\n미국에서 당대 최고의 뮤지션으로 인정받으려면, 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼 출연 경력이 있어야 한다는 말이 있습니다. 마이클 잭슨, 롤링 스톤즈, 폴 매카트니, 레이디 가가, 비욘세 등 전설적인 스타들은 모두 이 무대를 거쳐갔습니다.\n하지만 처음부터 하프타임 쇼가 이렇게 주목받았던 건 아닙니다. 초기에는 대학 마칭 밴드*가 소박하게 하프타임을 채웠습니다. 변화는 1990년대에 시작됐습니다. 경쟁 방송사들이 슈퍼볼 하프타임 시간대에 특별 프로그램을 편성하며 시청률 경쟁을 벌이자, NFL은 1991년 뉴키즈 온더 블록을 시작으로 슈퍼스타들을 무대에 올리기 시작했습니다.\n* 행진하며 악기를 연주하는 미국 대학의 관악대\nNFL은 1993년 마이클 잭슨의 공연이 폭발적인 반응을 얻으면서, 하프타임 쇼를 본격적으로 상업화했습니다. 흥미로운 점은 NFL이 출연 뮤지션에게 출연료를 지급하지 않는다는 사실입니다. 대신 밴드와 스태프는 물론, 가족과 친구를 포함한 모든 수행원의 경비만 부담합니다. 그럼에도 뮤지션들이 기꺼이 무료 공연에 나서는 이유는 분명합니다. 하프타임 쇼 출연 소식만으로도 음원 차트가 급상승하고, 1억 명 이상이 지켜보는 무대는 그 어떤 광고보다 강력한 홍보 효과를 만들어내기 때문입니다.\n\n2025 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼로 전 세계 음원 차트를 휩쓴 켄드릭 라마 / 사진:  Imago Images Sports\n초기 하프타임 쇼의 스폰서십 가격은 약 15억 원 수준이었습니다. 하지만 하프타임 쇼에 대한 관심이 높아지면서, 스폰서십 가격은 50배 가까이 올랐습니다. 타이어 제조회사 브리지스톤은 2008년부터 2012년까지 연간 약 150억 원, 펩시는 2013년부터 2022년까지 매년 361억 원을 스폰서십 비용으로 지출했습니다.\n2023년부터는 애플 뮤직이 스폰서로 나서며 연간 735억 원이라는 천문학적 금액을 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 음악 스트리밍 시장에서 스포티파이와 치열하게 경쟁 중인 애플 뮤직에게 이 투자는 결코 헛되지 않았습니다. 2025년 켄드릭 라마의 공연은 1억 3,350만 명이 시청하며 1993년 마이클 잭슨 이후 역대 최다 기록을 갈아치웠기 때문이죠.\n이제 FIFA 역시 슈퍼볼을 벤치마킹하기 시작했습니다. 오는 6월 열릴 북중미 월드컵 결승전에서 사상 첫 하프타임 쇼를 계획하고 있기 때문입니다. 다만 축구의 15분 하프타임 안에, 30분 이상이 소요되는 슈퍼볼 수준의 쇼를 구현할 수 있을지는 여전히 의문으로 남아 있습니다. FIFA가 자신들의 규칙을 지키면서 어떤 묘안을 내놓을지, 관심이 쏠립니다.\n미국인들의 버킷리스트\n슈퍼볼 직관\n슈퍼볼 입장권 가격 역시 상상을 초월합니다. 2025년 기준 평균 입장권 가격은 약 950만 원이었고, 가장 저렴한 좌석도 44만 원에 달했습니다. 이마저도 경기장 맨 꼭대기 층에 위치해, 실제로는 대형 스크린으로 경기를 봐야 할 정도입니다.\n이 금액은 미국 중산층에게도 부담스러운 수준입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아메리칸 풋볼에 열광하는 미국인들은 슈퍼볼 직관을 일생일대의 기회로 여깁니다. NFL의 인기가 높아질수록 이 꿈을 꾸는 사람은 늘어나고, 티켓 가격은 계속 오르지만 관중석은 늘 가득 찹니다.\n실제로 슈퍼볼 입장권 총 수익은 2010년 약 900억 원에서 2025년 약 2,400억 원으로 15년 사이 2.7배 증가했습니다. 7만~8만 명 규모의 경기장이 매년 거의 만석을 기록하면서 티켓 가격 상승이 곧바로 수익 증가로 이어지는 구조가 완성된 것이죠.\n\n하루 만에 맥주 24억 잔이 팔리는\n슈퍼볼 경제 효과\n2025년 루이지애나주 뉴올리언스에서 열린 제59회 슈퍼볼의 개최지 경제 효과는 약 1조 8,100억 원으로 추산됩니다. 이 가운데 절반은 외지에서 몰려든 팬들이 만들어낸 관광 특수였습니다. 10만 명이 넘는 팬들이 개최지를 찾았고, 이 중 92%가 평균 4일간 머물렀습니다. 그 결과 호텔 공실률은 4%에 불과했고, 슈퍼볼 준비 과정에서만 1만 개가 넘는 일자리가 새로 생겨났습니다. 세수 증대 효과 역시 1,000억 원을 훌쩍 넘었습니다.\n막대한 인프라 투자가 필요한 올림픽이나 월드컵과 달리, 슈퍼볼은 기존 시설만으로도 엄청난 수익을 만들어냅니다. 그래서 미국의 도시들은 슈퍼볼 유치를 두고 치열한 경쟁을 벌입니다. 과거에는 32개 NFL 구단의 투표로 개최지를 정했지만, 경쟁이 과열되자 2018년부터는 NFL이 도시들과 장기 협상을 통해 개최지를 결정하는 방식으로 바뀌었습니다.\n슈퍼볼 당일의 소비 규모도 놀랍습니다. 2025년 슈퍼볼 당일 미국에서는 맥주 12억 리터, 치킨 윙 14억 7,000개, 감자 칩 1,900만 개, 피자 290만 개가 팔렸습니다. 슈퍼볼은 미국에서 가장 많은 맥주가 소비되는 날이기도 합니다.\n\n슈퍼볼을 대표하는 음식이 된 치킨 윙 / 사진: Imagn Images\n슈퍼볼에는 미국의 역사가 깊이 새겨져 있습니다. 아메리칸 풋볼 자체가 영국의 럭비에서 독립해 만들어진 스포츠입니다. 19세기 말 미국 대학들이 영국의 영향에서 벗어나 자신들만의 규칙을 만들며 탄생시킨 아메리칸 풋볼은 문화적 독립의 상징이었죠.\n슈퍼볼 대표 음식 치킨 윙에는 더 아픈 역사가 담겨 있습니다. 백인 농장주들이 버린 닭 날개를 흑인 노예들이 모아 만들어 먹던 것이 1980년대 레스토랑과 바의 인기 메뉴가 되었고, 짜고 매운 소스가 맥주 판매를 늘리는 효과 덕분에 슈퍼볼의 상징이 되었습니다. 굶주림 속에서 태어난 음식이 미국 최대 축제의 주인공이 된 셈입니다.\n2026년 슈퍼볼이 열릴 경기장 역시 미국 역사의 한 장면을 보여줍니다. 캘리포니아주 산타 클라라의 리바이스 스타디움은 19세기 골드러시 시대 광부들을 위해 탄생한 청바지 브랜드 리바이스의 이름을 따왔습니다. 튼튼한 청바지로 황금을 찾아 나선 개척자들의 꿈을 지탱했던 리바이스는 이제 새로운 꿈을 좇는 미국인들이 모이는 성지가 되었죠.\n평등을 추구하는 리그 철학, 광고가 문화가 된 독특한 생태계, 그리고 모든 미국인의 꿈이 된 축제. 슈퍼볼은 이 모든 요소를 품고 성장했기에 미국인이 가장 사랑하는 지상 최대 스포츠 이벤트로 거듭날 수 있었습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희",
