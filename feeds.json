        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2025/09/17/8-common-devops-problems-and-how-to-solve-them-with-goland/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 18:15:54 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "One of the most popular posts on the /devops subreddit says, “After 24 years in IT, I’m done. I don’t want to debug another YAML file. This is not how I foresee spending my life.”\nDevOps can be frustrating, and the 3,000+ people who upvoted that post clearly agree. It doesn’t have to be this painful though. With the right tools and workflows, many of the struggles that DevOps engineers face daily can be simplified or even eliminated.\nHere are eight common DevOps problems and practical ways to solve them using GoLand, the JetBrains IDE for development in Go and DevOps work.\nWhy GoLand for DevOps?\nDevOps engineers traditionally have to manage a wide range of various tools, all with their own complex setups and features. Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Helm: no wonder articles like 73 Most Useful DevOps Tools in 2025 exist.\nAccording to the Developer Ecosystem: Data Playground, Go has become the go-to language for DevOps work, with over 760,000 DevOps engineers using it as their primary programming language. This makes sense, since Kubernetes and most modern DevOps tools are built in Go. When you need custom scripts, CLIs, or extensions, Go is the natural choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoLand provides direct access to the terminal, Kubernetes, Docker, and HTTP Client. The goal is to help engineers debug, deploy, and manage infrastructure faster, with less chaos and more confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at the specific problems that make DevOps work frustrating and how to fix them.\nProblem 1: Fixing broken Kubernetes deployments takes too many steps\nImagine deploying a new version of a service, but the container image itself is broken. The pod starts, it immediately fails, and you get errors in the logs.\nIn a typical workflow, you’d switch between several tools:\nCheck the logs with kubectl logs\nEdit the deployment manifest in a text editor\nReapply the manifest with kubectl apply\nCheck the pod status again in kubectl get pods to confirm everything is healthy\nThis constant switching between terminal, editor, and Docker tooling slows down recovery and makes it harder to stay focused on solving the issue.\nSolution: Fix issues in GoLand\nGoLand streamlines this entire troubleshooting loop inside one workspace. For example, imagine deploying a Go backend service connected to a Postgres database, where the pod crashes immediately upon startup. In GoLand, the process is much simpler because you can:\nOpen the logs directly in GoLand’s Kubernetes log viewer and spot the error – in this case, a misconfigured port number.\nEdit the deployment YAML in the IDE, with schema validation to avoid typos.\nReapply the fixed manifest directly from the Kubernetes integration.\nConfirm the pod starts correctly by watching its status turn green in the resources view.\nRe-check the logs inline to verify that the application is now running and connected to Postgres without errors.\nWith GoLand, you don’t have to jump between terminal, editor, and dashboards. Diagnosing, fixing, and redeploying all happen inside the IDE, helping you resolve issues quickly and keep services online.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2: Manual and error-prone Kubernetes secret management\nManaging secrets in Kubernetes often requires a tedious workflow: run kubectl to fetch the secret, decode it with base64, make the necessary edits, re-encode it, and then apply it back. These steps are easy to mess up, especially when responding to incidents and emergencies.\nSolution: Edit secrets directly in GoLand\nGoLand’s bundled Kubernetes plugin lets you open secrets securely as plain text and edit them directly. No encoding steps, no command line switching: Simply open the secret, make your changes, and save them.\nAnd because this functionality is built and maintained by JetBrains, you can rely on the same level of security and quality as the rest of the IDE, without having to depend on unverified third-party plugins.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3: Inefficient Kubernetes context and namespace switching\nMost engineers juggle multiple clusters and namespaces every day. Some resort to external apps like Docker Desktop just to switch the active cluster. Others rely on the terminal, repeatedly running kubectl config use-context and kubectl config set-context --namespace=….\nBoth approaches are repetitive, slow you down, and one wrong command can easily put you in the wrong cluster – something no one wants to happen in production.\nSolution: Switch contexts and namespaces in GoLand\nGoLand’s Kubernetes UI makes context and namespace switching faster and safer. You can now switch between them directly from a dropdown in the IDE, with clear visual indicators showing the active cluster and namespace.\nThis reduces the chance of accidentally applying changes to the wrong environment and eliminates repetitive terminal commands.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4: Too much DevOps time is wasted on repetitive tasks\nMany DevOps tasks can be quite repetitive: writing Terraform templates, piecing together long cloud CLI commands, parsing JSON files, or combing through endless pod logs.\nThese tasks aren’t complex, but they are time-consuming, tedious, and take attention away from solving real problems.\nSolution: Let AI Assistant handle the repetitive work\nAI Assistant, which comes with GoLand (and other JetBrains IDEs) can help engineers offload mundane tasks so they can focus on what matters. Some use cases include:\nGenerating infrastructure code such as Terraform snippets or YAML manifests instead of writing boilerplate by hand.\nCreating cloud CLI commands and scripts on demand, e.g. finding AWS autoscaling groups and ECS services across regions, scaling them up, and triggering new deployments with a single prompt.\nAnalyzing logs automatically, highlighting suspicious entries, frequent errors, or summaries.\nHandling JSON parsing and data transformations automatically – tasks that would otherwise require writing ad-hoc scripts\nBy delegating routine work to AI, engineers save time on the “boring stuff” and keep their focus on solving critical incidents, improving infrastructure, and shipping value to users.\nUnlike using external AI tools in a separate window, GoLand’s AI Assistant keeps everything in one place, helping you avoid context switching.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5: Managing infrastructure as code across different tools\nWorking with infrastructure as code means bouncing between different formats and technologies constantly – Terraform for provisioning, Helm charts for packaging and templating, and Kubernetes YAML for deployment.\nWhile you can add plugins in other editors, support is often inconsistent. Autocompletion may work for one tool but not another, validation can be inconsistent, and switching between terminal and editor tabs quickly gets messy.\nSolution: First-class support for Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes in GoLand\nGoLand provides native, consistent support for the key technologies DevOps teams rely on:\nTerraform: advanced autocompletion, on-the-fly validation, and navigation between resources.\nHelm charts: templating support, syntax highlighting, and smart YAML editing inside templates.\nKubernetes manifests: schema validation, quick fixes, and integration with the Kubernetes plugin for applying actions directly.\nInstead of piecing together several plugins, you get a single environment where IaC files, CLI workflows, and cluster operations all work together out of the box.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 6: Difficulty tracking logs across services during incidents\nWhen something breaks in Kubernetes, logs are often the first place to look. Without centralized log aggregation, engineers use kubectl logs combined with grep or have to copy-paste outputs into a local editor.\nWith multiple pods and a high log volume, it’s easy to miss critical lines, especially when you’re searching for patterns like status codes or error messages under time pressure.\nSolution: Stream and filter logs directly in GoLand\nThe Kubernetes plugin that is bundled in GoLand provides a built-in log viewer that makes troubleshooting faster. With it, you can:\nStream logs from pods directly in the IDE.\nUse search, filtering, and highlighting to quickly spot relevant entries.\nParse structured logs (like JSON) and filter by fields: For example, surface only rows with status values greater than 500\nThis is especially valuable for teams that don’t yet use centralized log collectors (like Loki or Kibana).\n\n\n\n\nProblem 7: Limited visibility of CI/CD pipeline configs\nCI/CD pipelines get complicated quickly. Editing .gitlab-ci.yml or GitHub Actions workflows in plain text editors or web interfaces makes it easy to miss issues. Maybe a variable name has a typo, or indentation is wrong, and you only discover it after the pipeline fails, or a stage doesn’t exist, and you try to reference to it later.\nSolution: CI/CD pipeline editing with validation in GoLand\nGoLand helps catch issues before they hit runners. When editing GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configs, you get:\nAutocompletion for jobs, stages, and variables.\nInline documentation right in the editor.\nSchema validation highlighting mistakes as you type.\nCompared to terminal editing or web interfaces, GoLand provides immediate feedback, so you can spot mistakes before they waste a pipeline run.\n\n\n\n\nFor TeamCity users, the TeamCity plugin lets you browse builds, check logs, and connect configs directly to the IDE.\nProblem 8: Inconvenient tracking of multiple port forwards\nAccessing internal services in Kubernetes usually means running kubectl port-forward pod-name 8080:80 from the terminal. It works but ties up a terminal session and makes tracking active forwards difficult. It’s easy to forget stopping processes or mix up port numbers.\nSolution: Port forwarding made easier in GoLand\nGoLand’s Kubernetes integration handles port forwarding directly from the IDE. Right-click a pod or service to create a port-forward with a few clicks. Starting from GoLand 2025.3, it’ll also be possible to do it from the editor.\nActive forwards are shown in the IDE, so you always know which services are accessible and on which ports. As a result, your terminal stays available for other tasks.\nThis makes common scenarios faster and easier to manage, such as testing service endpoints locally, validating patches, or investigating incidents without public exposure.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDevOps doesn’t have to feel like debugging YAML files forever. While toolchain complexity isn’t going away, having the right IDE can be a huge help when managing all the numerous tools that DevOps engineers have to handle daily.\nGoLand consolidates many common DevOps workflows into a single environment, reducing context switching and making infrastructure work more manageable. Think of it as a cockpit for your infrastructure: everything you need to see and control, without leaving your seat.\nReady to spend less time juggling tools and more time solving actual problems?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA has great support for debugging Java and Kotlin applications. But if you are building Spring Boot applications, you may want to access Spring components along with their metadata. That’s where the Spring Debugger plugin comes in. It makes life easier by letting you explore and use the entire Spring ApplicationContext right from your debugger.\nLet’s dive into how this powerful plugin can revolutionize your debugging workflow.\n\n\nSpring Debugger: ApplicationContext at Your Fingertips \n\n\n\nBeyond the Scope: Access Any Spring Bean\nImagine you are building a bookmarks management application using Spring Boot and you have a Spring bean BookmarkService with createBookmark() method as follows:\n@Service\npublic class BookmarkService {\n   private final BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n   private final CategoryService categoryService;\n\n   public BookmarkService(BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository,\n                          CategoryService categoryService) {\n       this.bookmarkRepository = bookmarkRepository;\n       this.categoryService = categoryService;\n   }\n\n   @Transactional\n   public Bookmark createBookmark(CreateBookmarkCmd cmd) {\n       var bookmark = new Bookmark(cmd.title(), cmd.url());\n       if(cmd.categoryName() != null) {\n           Category category = categoryService.findByName(cmd.categoryName()).orElse(null);\n           if (category == null) {\n               category = categoryService.createCategory(new Category(cmd.categoryName()));\n           }\n           bookmark.setCategory(category);\n       }\n       bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark);\n       return bookmark;\n   }\n}\nThe BookmarkService has BookmarkRepository and CategoryService beans injected. While creating a bookmark, we first check if there is a Category exists with the given name. If not, we will create a new Category and then save Bookmark.\nThe CategoryService is also a Spring bean with findByName(String) method as follows:\n@Service\npublic class CategoryService {\n   private final CategoryRepository categoryRepository;\n\n   public CategoryService(CategoryRepository categoryRepository) {\n       this.categoryRepository = categoryRepository;\n   }\n\n   @Cacheable(\"category-by-name\")\n   public Optional<Category> findByName(String name) {\n       return categoryRepository.findByNameEqualsIgnoreCase(name);\n   }\n}\nThe findByName() method is annotated with @Cacheable(\"category-by-name\") to cache the method result so that if you call this method with the same input it will return the cached result instead of executing the method logic again.\nNow, Imagine you’re debugging create bookmark use case. You hit a breakpoint in BookmarkService.createBookmark() method. Usually, you can access objects within the current scope, such as bookmarkRepository, bookmark, or categoryService. \nBut what if you need to inspect or interact with a bean that isn’t directly injected into your current class. For example, you may want to clear existing data or insert new data into the database by using a repository directly.\nLet’s say while debugging BookmarkService.createBookmark() method, we would like to temporarily delete all the categories using CategoryRepository.deleteAll()? Usually, you’d be out of luck.\nThis is where the Spring Debugger plugin shines. It allows you to access any Spring bean that exists within your ApplicationContext. Simply start typing the bean name into the expression input box, and the plugin will show matching beans. You can then invoke any methods on them, like calling categoryRepository.findAll() method and you can view the result. \n\n\n\n\nThis capability extends your debugging reach far beyond the immediate scope.\nManipulate Application State On-the-Fly\nConsider a common scenario: you have a service method, like CategoryService.findByName(), that caches its results. If you’re debugging an issue related to this method and call it repeatedly with the same input, the breakpoint won’t be hit because the results are served from the cache.\nTraditionally, you might need to restart your application or temporarily disable caching to force the breakpoint to hit. With the Spring Debugger plugin, there’s a much more elegant solution.\nYou can directly access the cacheManager bean from your ApplicationContext. Inspect the available caches, find the specific cache (e.g., category-by-name), and then invoke the invalidate() method on it.\n\n\n\n\nAfter invalidating the cache, when you resume execution, the breakpoint in CategoryService will now be hit because there’s no entry in the cache for that name.\nThis demonstrates the incredible power to invoke any method on any Spring bean to dynamically control and debug your application’s flow.\nAccess Core Spring Components and Properties\nSometimes we may get tricky problems due to configuration issues or misunderstanding of conventions. While debugging such issues, we may want to explore the application’s runtime configuration or access low-level components to interact with database or publish application events using ApplicationEventPublisher.\nThe utility of the Spring Debugger plugin isn’t limited to your custom beans. It also provides direct access to core Spring components that are part of your ApplicationContext:\nEntityManager: If you’re using JPA, you can directly access the entityManager and invoke any methods on it.\nEnvironment: Gain access to the environment bean, which provides an abstraction to all application properties. You can query specific property values to see their current configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStreamline Your Debugging Workflow and Save Time\nThe ability to access any Spring bean has significant implications for your overall debugging process.\nEliminate Temporary Code Changes: How many times have you temporarily injected a bean, added log statements, or introduced other debugging code, only to have to remove it once the issue is found? With Spring Debugger, you don’t need to make those temporary changes. You can directly access any bean and explore your use case as needed.\nEffortless Test Data Setup: Imagine debugging a scenario that requires specific test data, perhaps an action only an administrator can perform. Instead of logging out, and logging in as an administrator, performing the action, and then returning to your debug flow, you can simply access a service bean directly to insert test data into the database, bypassing complex setup steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, the Spring Debugger plugin empowers you with all the power of the Spring ApplicationContext right at your fingertips while debugging. It significantly enhances your ability to understand, inspect, and manipulate your Spring Boot application’s state, making your debugging sessions more efficient and productive.\nGo ahead and install the Spring Debugger plugin to explore its powers yourself!",

Your feedback plays a vital role in shaping the final release.\nIf you haven’t joined an EAP before, check out this blog post to see how it works and what you can expect. These builds are free to use, and you can get the latest EAP build in several ways:\nDownload it from our website.\nUse the Toolbox App.\nInstall the snap package from the Snapcraft store if you’re using a compatible Linux distribution.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nRider 2025.3 EAP 1 release highlights\nThis first build brings a variety of updates for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and more. Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of Rider 2025.3 EAP 1.\nUnity\nWe’ve added an IL Viewer for Unity projects (RIDER-86108). Previously, checking the IL code for Unity assemblies required manual steps and workarounds. Now Rider automatically finds the correct assemblies, so you can open the IL Viewer and inspect your Unity code right away.\nUnreal Engine\nRider now lets you customize which folders and files are included in the .uproject project model (RIDER-119424). This means that you can add extra projects, like a .csproj with your own file list, and Rider will load them automatically. This is especially useful if you work with additional scripting frameworks such as NoesisGUI.\nGodot\nWe’ve made several important updates to improve the Rider experience for Godot developers:\nGDExtension support: You can now work on GDExtensions in Rider using the new project template.\n\n\n\n\nTyped dictionaries support: No more parsing errors when working with typed dictionaries in GDScript in Rider.\n\n\n\n\nLeading whitespace style inspection: A new inspection detects inconsistent indentation (tabs vs. spaces) in GDScript files and provides a quick-fix to bring them in line with your configured code style.\n\n\n\n\nChickensoft GoDotTest support: You can now run and debug C# tests directly in Rider with the Chickensoft GoDotTest runner (RIDER-113850). \nAutomatic builds on focus change\nWe’ve introduced a new option that triggers a build whenever Rider loses focus (RIDER-127586). This makes working with Godot smoother, as it allows the Inspector to immediately reload and display updated exports without requiring manual builds. You can enable this option in Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Godot Engine.\n.slnx solution templates\nRider now lets you create .slnx solution files directly from its templates. Previously, the only way to create a .slnx solution file was to save a .sln file and rename it; that workaround is no longer needed.\nFor the complete list of updates in this build, head over to our issue tracker.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1 today and take the new features for a spin. Your feedback drives Rider forward, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.\nThank you for being part of our Early Access Program!\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1",

It also brings important improvements important improvements to ReSharper’s Out-of-Process (OOP) mode and several updates for ReSharper C++. Let’s take a closer look!\n\n\n\n\nFaster startup with Out-of-Process mode on .NET Core\nReSharper’s Out-of-Process mode now runs on .NET Core and starts up even faster, thanks to runtime performance gains. While stability and responsiveness remain the main goals of Out-of-Process mode, the faster startup is a nice bonus on top of these improvements. If you experience any issues with Out-of-Process mode, please let us know – drop a note in the comments or in our tracker.\nOut-of-Process mode enabled by default\nDuring this EAP cycle, ReSharper will run in Out-of-Process mode by default. Working out of process brings measurable performance improvements, but we want to hear your subjective experience. Is ReSharper faster or more responsive for you? Is it stable? \nPlease note:\nSome features are not yet available in Out-of-Process: .NET profilers (dotTrace, dotMemory), dotCover, Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA), and AI Assistant. Let us know which tools you rely on most so we can prioritize support. You can share your thoughts in this ticket.\nWhen running ReSharper in Out-of-Process mode, you may encounter exceptions. Most of them are diagnostic and not indicative of actual errors. Still, we’d appreciate you reporting them.\nIf you prefer, you can switch back to In-Process mode via ReSharper | Options | Environment | Products & Features by disabling the Run ReSharper in separate process option. Alternatively, start Visual Studio with the /ReSharper.InProcess flag to temporarily revert, and save this preference later in ReSharper’s Options.\nUpdates for C++ development\nReSharper C++ now supports several new C++26 features, including pack indexing, expansion statements, and structured bindings with packs (RSCPP-35817, RSCPP-36874, and RSCPP-36532).\n\n\n\n\nQuick Info in ReSharper C++ now shows class padding alongside size and alignment, helping you spot wasted memory at a glance (RSCPP-36866).\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also added support for the GNU _Complex and _Imaginary keywords used in complex data types (RSCPP-15015).\n\n\n\n\nYou can now set the return value in the Extract Method refactoring to one of the local variables (RSCPP-23436).\nFor the full list of resolved issues and improvements, please refer to our issue tracker.\nTry it out and share your feedback\nThe latest EAP build is ready for you to explore. We encourage you to test the improvements and share your impressions. Your feedback directly shapes the future of ReSharper and .NET Tools, and we greatly appreciate your input.\nJoin the conversation in the comments or report issues via YouTrack. Stay tuned for more updates as the EAP cycle continues – there’s plenty more to come!\nDownload ReSharper 2025.3 EAP 1",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from the 2025.3 release, DataGrip and other JetBrains IDEs with database support will stop using the term query console. From now on, we’ll use query file – because consoles were essentially files all along, and it’s time the UI reflected that. We’ve made the workflow simpler, more discoverable, and more consistent.\nA bit of history 🏛️\nWhy did we have consoles in the first place? Here’s the short story.\nBack when JetBrains first added database functionality to IntelliJ IDEA, Java developers mostly worked with databases from the terminal. The quickest way to bring that workflow into the IDE was to give people a temporary area for writing SQL – and that temporary SQL file was called a console.\nFor many years, the IDE provided just one default console per project, and that seemed fine, but users asked for more. They wanted multiple consoles, the ability to pick the database or schema, and better control over context via the UI.\nProblems 😬\nConsoles were essentially script files, similar to what other database tools provide, but with a few quirks:\nNot part of the project. Consoles lived outside the project structure, even though users worked in a project in DataGrip.\nHard to find. They were stored in an obscure folder (next to scratch files), causing people to create consoles and then not know where to look for them. Because DataGrip autosaves these consoles, nothing was lost – but that made discovery more difficult. Users wouldn’t get a “save” prompt, so they’d create consoles and later be surprised they couldn’t find them or change their context without extra steps.\nDifficult context switching. You couldn’t change the dialect, data source, or schema for a console file via the UI. If you wanted it to behave like a local file, you had to manually save or transfer it.\nConfusing name. The term query console didn’t communicate what the feature actually was, and we kept getting feedback that newcomers didn’t understand it.\nIn short, consoles were useful in spirit but awkward in practice. Something had to change.\nThe change 🧚🏻‍♀️\nWe agonized, deliberated, and then did the obvious: merged consoles and files.\nPractically, query editing is now file-based, so query scripts are visible in your project, easy to locate, and flexible to manage.\nHow it works now:\nTo write a query to the database, create a query file from the context menu of the data source or any of its objects, like you did before with query consoles. This new file will be named Query_[$DATA_SOURCE$].sql.  The name pattern can be customized in Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, query files are saved in the queries folder, which is located in the project folder. The project folder (and the queries folder) is visible in the Files tool window. You can change the storage path in Settings, and any custom folder you select will also appear in the Files tool window.\n\n\n\n\nFiles with an attached database context now show a data-source-like icon instead of the generic database icon used before. This should make query files easier to spot. We’d especially love to hear your feedback about this visual update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll prior console limitations are gone! You can now re-attach query files, change their dialect and data source, and treat them like ordinary project files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jump to Query Console button on the database explorer toolbar has been renamed to Jump to Query File and given a new icon. It now lists all query files associated with the current data source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you upgrade DataGrip, a migration dialog will help you transfer all of your consoles to files and guide you through the new workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old Database Consoles folder under the Scratches and Consoles will remain for one more release cycle, after which we’ll remove it completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ ❓\nWill my existing consoles be lost? \n\nNo. We’re carefully converting them to *.sql files and keeping them in the old location, but only for one release cycle.\nCan I keep the old behavior?\n\nTechnically, you can, but only for one more release cycle and only for old projects. You will keep seeing a migration dialog after each IDE restart, however. For new projects, only the new logic will work.\nWhat happens to the consoles of global data sources?\nIn the migration dialog, you will be able to define a separate folder for migrating consoles of such data sources. This folder will be saved in the settings and will serve as the default location for query files created for global data sources. To access these files from the IDE, you will need to attach the folder to each specific project.\nWill the same thing happen in other JetBrains IDEs?\n\nYes, but for now it’s only released in DataGrip EAP. The only difference is that in other JetBrains IDEs with database functionality, query files are migrated by default to a folder inside the .idea subfolder within the project. This folder is usually listed in .gitignore.\nWhat’s next ⏭️\nLater in this 2025.3 release cycle, we’ll add a Query Files node to the database explorer. Clicking it will show all files associated with the current data source, further improving discoverability.\nWe’re rolling out this change in the first EAP build to gather feedback from our community. Please try it out and tell us what’s missing.\n\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think in any of these ways:\nComment in the corresponding YouTrack ticket\nComplete the feedback form: https://www.jetbrains.com/feedback/datagrip/\nEmail us at datagrip@jetbrains.com\nTag @DataGrip on X or follow https://x.com/datagrip\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback!\nThe DataGrip team",

There’s no scam here. We’re aligning usage to real, public provider prices per token. Whether you run through us or directly with providers, it will be similar. Discounts vary, and yes, some companies still burn VC money to attract users (also that’s changing). We’re a real business; we can’t play that game. This is the real price of AI. Our job now is to make sure the value you get from our product far exceeds what you spend.\nSecond, transparency. We’ll roll out UX updates with statistics in a few weeks, and more usage details and controls after that. Being transparent about a bad situation is better than having unclear or uncontrolled terms. Our previous quotas were a temporary measure, and so they were not transparent. With the new approach, the rules of the game are clear. This is a sustainable foundation that will help us look further into the future and design new products and services around it. \n\n\n\n\n“I can’t estimate how many credits I need for specific tasks.”\nAI usage isn’t a flat fee because it depends on the type of model you use and the amount of text (tokens) flowing in and out. That means the same question can cost differently depending on how it’s phrased, how much context is added, or how long the conversation goes. In agentic workflows, where the AI may iterate and correct itself, usage can naturally be higher.\nThat said, you don’t have to fly blind. We aim to give you the tools to get the best grasp on AI usage and make sure you stay in control:\nClear pricing per credit: We align with public provider costs, so you always know the unit price.\nTransparent usage stats: We’re rolling out UX updates that let you see exactly where credits go. It will roll out in waves, with the first wave in the next few weeks.\nBest-practice guides: We will share ways to phrase prompts and structure workflows so you get quality results faster (and spend less).\nSafeguards: Subscription quotas and alerts help prevent unexpected overuse, and you can always top up to continue your work.\nThink of credits like fuel for your AI workflows: you may not know the exact mileage before the trip, but you’ll always see your fuel gauge and can plan accordingly.\n“My quota runs out in half a day. Is it a bug?”\nNo – the quota got smaller for both AI Pro and AI Ultimate. In our data, about 80% of users (plan and usage dependent) won’t hit the new limits. The downside is that the most active AI users are the most affected.\nAgain, we’re not targeting you and we’re not slicing by some percentile; we’re aligning with costs so we don’t burn money indefinitely, while still giving away more (e.g. AI Ultimate includes roughly 15% more value than you pay each month, and annual plans can go up to about 40% more than your pay). \nThere’s another reason quotas can vanish fast: agentic workflows. Agents collect context and iterate through a plan; that means multiple, long requests that eat tokens. Junie, our coding agent, is built for quality on real‑world dev tasks. Speed and cost are part of the product. Early on, we took this risk on us. That was fine for kick‑off – but it’s not how this works long‑term.\nJunie is designed for complex tasks and provides high quality output. Code generation, verification and tests together take more AI credits – but it also helps Junie achieve the better result for your job. We don’t want to sacrifice quality over speed: we benchmark the models and choose the best for your tasks, we always prioritize Junie’s ability to compare the solutions and offer you the most suitable one. We train Junie to verify the steps it is taking – not just to generate code faster, but to create solutions that you can use and maintain. All this helps Junie perform like agents in more expensive plans (up to $200/month), but we aim to keep the cost of usage reasonable and constantly work on optimization.\nSmart ways to think about your AI quota\nTrack your usage (detailed stats are coming soon; for now, watch your in‑app meter).\nConsider the best tool for the task – whether it’s an AI agent (complex workflows, iterations, validation, etc.) or an AI assistant (more straightforward Q&A and one-step solutions). \nBe intentional with the way you prompt and the model choice (e.g., GPT‑5 is often cheaper than Claude 4 with comparable results – try switching if it works for you).\nStart over instead of a follow-up if you feel that the agent is lost. Based on the way LLMs work, multiple follow-ups (e.g., more than seven) usually drift away and take more credits (the longer the chat, the more context is passed with every request) but may not get you closer to the result you have in mind.\nFavor smaller/cheaper models for drafts (check the hints in AI Chat), then upgrade for final runs.\n“I just paid for an annual AI subscription based on the old patterns. Why no refund?”\nWe do have a refund policy, and some of you have already received refunds that extended your non‑AI subscriptions. Given this, we understand the frustration. Even if the refund window has passed, we’ve prepared a set of special alternatives for annual AI Pro and AI Ultimate users; you can select the one that works best for you. Keep in mind that we can’t grant refunds for All Products Pack and dotUltimate beyond regular policies, because AI Pro was included there at no extra charge.\nThat said, we still think annual subscriptions are a good deal. Example: AI Ultimate (annual) gives you 420 AI Credits for $300 — roughly 40% more credits than your payment at public rates.\n***\nAI is a great tool, and it’s changing how we build software. But it’s not magic — especially not free, unlimited magic. As professionals, we should understand how it works, how much it costs, and how to use it better. In the real world, speed and cost matter as much as quality. We believe that’s where the industry is heading. So let’s face it and start mastering these together.\nThank you to everyone who’s supported us – and for all the honest feedback. We’re building a sustainable business. Our future is tied to the value we create for you, so we’ll keep delivering exactly that step by step.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re kicking off the next development cycle and inviting you to join it.\nThe Early Access Program (EAP) for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 is now open, offering an early look at the new features and improvements we’re working on. By evaluating new features and sharing constructive feedback, you help us provide you with powerful, reliable tooling for professional development.\n\n\n\n\nAs always, EAP builds are free to use and can be installed side by side with your stable IDE version. You can get EAP builds from the Toolbox App, download them from the website, or use snaps for Ubuntu.\nDownload IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 EAP\nPlease note that EAP builds are not fully tested and might be unstable, as the version is still a work in progress. Please keep this in mind when using them.\nIn this post, we’d like to share a glimpse of what’s in our planning dashboards for the upcoming release. The list below is neither final nor exhaustive, but it’s meant to show the direction we’re heading.\nSingle distribution \nIn 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA will move to unified distribution, and several important changes related will appear during the EAP cycle. These include more features becoming available without subscription, such as wizards, basic highlighting for JavaScript, SQL, JPQL, template engines markup, and support database schema exploration. A detailed list of features going free will be published closer to the release.\nAlso there will be no IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition EAP builds available in the Toolbox App or from the IntelliJ Platform Gradle plugin. Please use the EAP builds of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate instead. More information about Gradle builds will be published later on platform.jetbrains.com.\nTechnology updates \nWe’re continuing our effort to support the latest technologies you may use in your projects. This release brings full support for Java 25, Spring Boot 4, JUnit 6, all expected to be released within the next few months.\nSpring \nIn addition to supporting new features introduced for Spring 7, we’re working on significantly improving Spring Data JDBC support and extending the capabilities of the Spring Debugger introduced in v2025.2.\nKotlin\nKotlin support in the IDE continues to improve, with enhancements to code completion and overall quality in K2 mode. In addition to support for Spring 7, the Kotlin Routing DSL is getting better IDE assistance, along with various quality-of-life improvements for Spring development.\nFor Kotlin Notebook, we’re also improving stability and adding more improvements, like support for database integration – one of the most common scenarios in server-side development.\nKubernetes support\nStarting with 2025.3, we’re improving the experience of working with Kubernetes YAML files. We’re aiming to enable inlay quick actions in the editor for faster port forwarding, resource status updates, current context selection, and easier access to secrets.\nUser experience\nIn v2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA is getting a visual upgrade – the new Islands theme. Based on the feedback we’ve collected and our experiments in the previous release cycle, we’re now looking into making it the new default. We are going to share more details about the new theme soon.\nMeanwhile, you can try the Islands theme in this EAP build by enabling it in Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance | Theme.\nAnother notable change we’re working on is the new Welcome screen that takes you straight into the IDE, with no extra dialog windows or additional clicks.\nWe’re also working on improving how the IDE communicates with you while project indexes are still being built. This includes a clearer overview of background tasks and more transparent, predictable progress indicators so you can stay focused on your code with fewer distractions.\nRemote development\nFollowing the improvements introduced in the previous release to refine the remote development experience, we’re continuing in the same direction. In v2025.3, we plan to enable smoother typing for more languages including CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and shell scripts. Additionally, the launch experience is being revamped to accelerate startup and make it more seamless.\nTerminal\nIn v2025.3, we’re bringing AI support to the terminal, starting with inline completion as the first step.\nStability\nA large portion of our team’s workload is dedicated to maintaining the quality and stability of the IDE. We’ll communicate those improvements in a dedicated What’s Fixed post, like we did for the previous release.\nFor the full list of fixes and improvements already included in the first 2025.3 EAP build, please refer to the release notes.\nShare your feedback\nTake part in the Early Access Program by trying out the EAP builds and sharing your feedback with us. You can get in touch with us on X, BlueSky or LinkedIn, or leave a comment below. If you come across a bug or something that doesn’t work as expected, please report it via our issue tracker.\nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Java release cadence means we get a new Java version every six months. Java 25 was released on September 16, 2025. At JetBrains, we are committed to supporting new technologies in IntelliJ IDEA and adding useful enhancements for both stable and preview features. In this blog post, we will give you an overview of some changes to the Java language and how they are supported in IntelliJ IDEA. This post is limited to stable features only. Preview features will be covered separately in dedicated blog posts on relevant topics.\nJava 25 includes several changes to the language that make Java easier to use. Features like compact source files and instance main methods, as well as module import declarations, make it easier to get started with Java, both for students and when creating small projects like prototypes or hobby projects. Flexible constructor bodies allow more flexibility in constructors, giving you the option to calculate or validate data before calling the constructor of the super class. Scoped values are a new model for thread-local variables, adapted to virtual threads. They will be more useful with structured concurrency, which is currently still in preview.\nApart from changes to the language itself, there are improvements to both performance and performance insights. Compact object headers reduce memory footprint and improve cache efficiency. Ahead-of-time method profiling lets the JVM warm up more quickly by using execution data from prior runs, improving startup performance. Improvements to garbage collection (GC) like generational Shenandoah, plus better class-loading and linking optimizations, contribute to noticeably smoother server-style workloads.\nAs Java 25 is an LTS (long-term support) release, many people will be migrating to this version from Java 21, 17, 11, or even earlier. If you are coming to Java 25 from Java 21, have a look at the section describing the most relevant changes since Java 21.\nBefore diving into the new features, let’s set up IntelliJ IDEA to use Java 25.\nUsing Java 25 in IntelliJ IDEA (setup)\nTo use Java 25, you will need to download the JDK. You can do so from inside IntelliJ IDEA or by using tools like SDKMAN! To download a JDK from IntelliJ IDEA, open the Project Structure, go to the tab Project Settings | Project, open the drop-down menu in the SDK field, and select Download JDK. \nDownloading JDK from inside IntelliJ IDEA\n\n\n\nIn the Download JDK popup that opens, set Version to 25, and in the Vendor field, select the vendor you want to use. \nYou can also download Early Access (EA) versions of the JDK from inside IntelliJ IDEA, for example, when the next release becomes available or if you’d like to try Valhalla (which is based on Java 23). IntelliJ IDEA will warn you that these are not intended for production use. \nDownloading an Early Access version\n\n\n\nNext, you need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the right language level. To use Java 25 stable features, which is recommended for production code, set Language level to 25 – Compact source files, module imports.\nSetting Language level to 25\n\n\n\nIf you want to try out preview features, set Language level to 25 (Preview) – Primitive Types in Patterns, etc.\nSetting Language level to 25 (Preview)\n\n\n\nNew stable features in Java 25\nLet’s take a look at some of the features Java 25 introduces and how IntelliJ IDEA can help you use them.\nCompact Source Files and Instance Main Methods (JEP 512)\nJava has been working on the so-called “on-ramp”, making the language easier to use. Compact source files and instance main methods are part of that effort. It is now possible for beginners to start writing code without needing to learn about language concepts that they won’t need until they start writing larger programs. For experienced programmers, this feature can help them quickly prototype ideas without needing a lot of boilerplate code. Code can be evolved and expanded as skills and applications grow. \nTo quickly see the difference, let’s look at a classic example: HelloWorld. We have probably all written a HelloWorld example when we first started, possibly in a language other than Java or English. The classic HelloWorld.java looks like this:\npublic class HelloWorld {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n       System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n   }\n}\nTo write this code, you had to declare a class and a lengthy main method, including concepts like public and static that are not relevant to beginners. Let’s compare this to the HelloWorld example using new features from compact source files and instance main methods. \nWhen creating a new Java class via New | Java Class, in the New Java Class popup, select the Compact source file option. Note that this compact source file is created in the root directory of your project, even if you create it from another package. IntelliJ IDEA automatically adds an instance main method – void main() – to the file. Next, you can add a method to print “Hello, World!”. You can now use IO.println() as a convenience method without needing to understand what System.out means and without even needing to add a static import. If you do want to add a static import for java.lang.IO, IntelliJ IDEA offers a quick-fix to do so.\nCreating `HelloWorld.java`\n\n\n\nNote that different variations of the main method are now possible, as described here.\nIntelliJ IDEA has some new live templates to add a main method to an implicit class, either with or without arguments: main, maina, psvm, and psvma. Using the psvm or main live templates inside a compact source file will add the new main method, while they will continue to add the classic main method inside a class, as you can see in the preview.\nLive templates for the main method in a compact source file\n\n\n\nLive templates for the main method in a compact source file\n\n\n\nOur new version of HelloWorld now looks like this:\nvoid main() {\n   IO.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\nCompare this code to the original example. It is much shorter, contains less boilerplate, and is limited to only the things we need: a main method and a call to print a line with the provided “Hello, World!” String.\nAs beginners often need to interact with the console, a convenient readln() method was also added. This is an overloaded method which can take a String argument that is printed to the console before reading the input. Let’s expand our previous example to read a name from the console. To help you use these new convenience methods, IntelliJ IDEA introduces two new live templates: iop for println() and ior for readln().\nExpanding the example to use the convenience method readln()\n\n\n\nNote that these changes to the language are also taken into account when creating new projects. When you create a new Java project, set Build system to IntelliJ, and select Add sample code, a compact source file with a void main() method will be added. \nCreating a new project with the IntelliJ build system\n\n\n\nPrototyping and teaching\nWhile extremely useful for students and teachers, this feature does not just benefit beginners. It also allows experienced developers to quickly try out ideas or create a prototype. \nWhen you create a new Java project with Maven or Gradle as the selected build system, the generated source code will include a regular class, but with IO.println() instead of System.out.println(). If you are using Maven or Gradle, you’re likely working on something bigger, with actual classes instead of compact source files. Another reason to use classes is that a compact source file needs to be in the default package, and frameworks generally don’t support this. \nCreating a new project with Maven\n\n\n\nTo quickly create a prototype, you can create a Java compact file from the src/main/java directory in the Project tool window. IntelliJ IDEA will provide a default name for the file, so your thought process is not disrupted when you want to quickly try something out.\nCreating a Java compact file\n\n\n\nWhen prototyping, learning, or teaching, you can gradually expand your code to include features you might need when writing code that is part of a larger project, or when introducing new concepts to your students. You can convert an implicit class to a regular class using the Convert an implicitly declared class of a compact source file into a regular class quick-fix.\nConverting an implicitly declared class of a compact source file into a regular class\n\n\n\nShould you prefer to use an implicit class at any point, the reverse is also possible. Similarly, there are quick-fixes to convert IO.println() to System.out.println(), and vice versa. These are probably not things you would do as part of your daily work. But you might use features like this for coding challenges, like Advent of Code, or other fun side projects.\nThe new void main() method does not need String[] args. However, should you decide to use the args in your code, IntelliJ IDEA will help you by adding them to the method, as you can see below. If you like this kind of completion, please let us know in the comments what you are currently missing. \nCompletion to add `args` to the main method\n\n\n\nWith this feature, we finally have a separation in Java between prototypes and other small projects, and enterprise applications. IntelliJ IDEA supports both small and large applications. \nWe have already covered this feature in a previous Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA post, when it was still in preview. Please have a look at that post to learn about additional support for this feature in IntelliJ IDEA. For a more in-depth explanation of this specific feature, see Mala Gupta’s previous post Java 24: ‘HelloWorld’ and ‘main()’ meet minimalistic. There are examples of practical use cases on when and how to use it to create small programs and prototypes in Java 24: Build Games, Prototypes, Utilities, and More – With Less Boilerplate. Note that (among other things) the following was changed in Java 25: Compact source files were previously called simple source files, and you now need to use the qualified name IO.println() or use an import statement.\nModule Import Declarations (JEP 511)\nModule import declarations simplify the importing of frequently used classes (java.base) or modular libraries, without having to keep adding individual import statements to keep the compiler happy (even though IntelliJ IDEA can do this for you 😉). This feature makes things easier. You can write code without needing to worry about imports, which is useful when learning or prototyping.\nAlternatively, if you have a class that imports multiple classes from a module, you can replace them with a module import statement. When you perform the Optimize imports action, the individual imports for classes imported by the module will be removed.\nAs your codebase grows, you might prefer to add import statements with specific imports, which you can do using the Replace with single class imports quick-fix.\nOptimizing imports\n\n\n\nIf you would like to remove unused module imports when performing Optimize imports, you can configure this in the settings. Open Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java and go to the Imports tab. Then, select the Delete unused module imports option.\nConfiguring the IDE to delete unused module imports\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are exported by a module, click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut for Go to Declaration or Usages, as shown here. \nYou might wonder what the difference is between module imports and wildcard imports. Wildcard imports in Java allow you to replace the import for multiple classes from the same package with one line, containing an *. Module imports allow you to import classes from different packages. One downside of this is the risk of potential namespace clashes. But don’t worry, IntelliJ IDEA can help you identify and fix these, as described here. \nShould you replace your current import statements with module imports? Probably not. In enterprise code, most developers prefer to have single imports. Note that IntelliJ IDEA allows you to configure the number of imports to add before replacing them with a wildcard. By default, this number is set to five. To change it, open Settings, go to Editor | Code Style | Java, and open the Imports tab. Then, set Class count to use import with ‘*’ to the desired number. Since most coding standards prefer single imports over wildcard imports, we assume the same will be true for module imports. For this reason, we are not planning to have an inspection to automatically replace existing imports with import module java.base;. \nHowever, even if you’re not using this feature explicitly, you will use it implicitly when using compact source files (described above). This feature was previously described in Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA. For more background information, see Module Import Declarations: No More Import Hell by Mala Gupta.\nFlexible Constructor Bodies (JEP 513)\nWith flexible constructor bodies, previously known as “statements before super()”, you are now allowed to write statements in the constructor of a derived class before calling the constructor of the super class. This is useful if you want to validate or compute data in your constructor before passing it to super(), or when a superclass calls a method from its constructor that you want to override in the subclass and access a field from the subclass inside this method. \nPreviously, the call to super() had to be the first call in the constructor. IntelliJ IDEA would give you a warning if you tried to add statements before super().\nWarning about a statement before `super()`\n\n\n\nA workaround for this restriction is to call static methods inline, as arguments passed to super(). While this is still possible, you now have the flexibility to call these methods before calling super() with the results.\nThere are some limitations on which types of statements you can execute before the call to super(). The statements cannot access the object under construction, which means you cannot access instance members of a class before the execution of super() completes or call methods of the derived class.\nThis new functionality should be used responsibly. Just because you can put arbitrary code before super() doesn’t mean you should move every possible validation or I/O operation into constructors. Constructors are best kept lightweight, deterministic, and free of heavy side effects. Expensive operations, retries, or external resource access are better handled in factories, builders, or initialization methods.\nIn short, this feature lets you model object invariants more naturally through inheritance, but it doesn’t change the golden rule – constructors should remain focused and predictable.\nWhile this feature might not be that exciting by itself, it is a necessary step to make value classes and objects (currently in preview), as well as upcoming null-restricted value class types (currently in draft), possible. Both of these features are part of Project Valhalla. We will discuss this topic later in a separate blog post.\nFor a more detailed explanation of this feature and examples of how to use it, have a look at the following video featuring Dr. Venkat Subramaniam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis feature was previously described in Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA. For additional details and examples, see Mala Gupta’s previous blog post Constructor Makeover in Java 22. Note that this post was written when this feature was still in preview. The only significant change since then is that a constructor body is now allowed to initialize fields in the same class before invoking a constructor. \nScoped Values (JEP 506)\nScoped values are a new model for thread-local variables adapted to virtual threads. They make it possible to share immutable data within a thread and with child threads in a convenient, safe, and scalable way.\nIn some cases, you want to share data between components of your application or between your application and a framework, such as information about a logged-in user and their permissions. While it is possible to use thread-local variables (variables of type ThreadLocal), there are several downsides to doing so, which might cause potential issues.\nThreadLocal variables are mutable, which makes it hard to keep track of their current value and to reason about the code. The value of a ThreadLocal variable is retained for the lifetime of a thread, unless explicitly removed by calling the remove() method. Developers may forget to do so, which means data might be stored in memory longer than needed, leading to potential performance problems, as well as security issues because data might be visible to unrelated code running on the same thread. ThreadLocal variables can be inherited by a child thread, but each child thread will need to create a copy of the variable, which can add to the memory footprint.\nVirtual threads, added in Java 21, allow us to create many more threads than platform threads. If they each retain a copy of a thread-local variable, this will impact the memory usage. On the other hand, virtual threads may not live as long as platform threads, which minimizes the potential for memory leaks. \nTo use a ScopedValue, you need to first declare it. It makes sense to declare it as final. Next, you need to bind the ScopedValue to some data and pass a Runnable or ScopedValue.CallableOp, which may be realized as a lambda. This is done in the ScopedValue.where() method. The operation – and any code called from it – will be able to get the ScopedValue, but once it is done running, this data will be cleaned up. Scoped values have a clearly defined scope, which makes the code easier to reason about. If you try to use a ScopedValue that is not bound, a NoSuchElementException is thrown, as you can see in the following example.\nUsing `ScopedValue`\n\n\n\nWhile you cannot set a ScopedValue, you can rebind it. In the example below, the variable is bound to the value “24” inside the main method. The update() method is called from here, where the value is bound to “25” (24 + 1). When printed, it will print the current value, “25”.\npublic class RebindExample {\n   ScopedValue<Integer> JAVA_VERSION = ScopedValue.newInstance();\n   void main() {\n       ScopedValue.where(JAVA_VERSION, 24).run(this::update);\n   }\n\n   private void update() {\n       ScopedValue.where(JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_VERSION.get() + 1).run(() -> {\n           IO.println(\"Hello, Java \" + JAVA_VERSION.get()); // prints 25\n       });\n   }\n}\nScoped values are even more useful with structured concurrency, currently in its fifth preview.\nStructured concurrency will make it possible for data to be automatically inherited by any threads that a thread forks. The child threads’ scope will be contained in the parent thread’s scope. With scoped values, it is no longer necessary to make copies of the data, meaning they scale very well with many (virtual) threads. This topic deserves its own blog post, where we can dive deeper into new use cases, migration paths, and performance comparisons between different approaches. \nAs we have seen, scoped values solve several problems associated with ThreadLocal.They reduce memory overhead, improve predictability, and make reasoning about concurrent code much easier. Does this mean you should immediately rewrite all your code to use ScopedValue? Not necessarily. Frameworks like Spring and others still rely heavily on ThreadLocal, and migrating all existing components to Java 25 isn’t something that will happen overnight. Also, the intention behind scoped values was never to deprecate or replace ThreadLocal outright, but to offer a cleaner, safer alternative. However, you might consider using scoped values for new code or modules, especially where you are already facing typical ThreadLocal issues: leaks, context propagation, and cleanup.\nPerformance and profiler improvements\nLanguage features are just half of the story. Java 25 also brings significant runtime improvements. Let’s take a brief look at the changes:\nAhead-of-Time Method Profiling (JEP 515) speeds up warm-up by using method execution profile data from a prior run. The JVM can use that data immediately at startup so that hot methods are already known, reducing the delay before reaching peak performance. \nJFR Cooperative Sampling (JEP 518) and JFR Method Timing & Tracing (JEP 520) improve observability: Cooperative sampling lets threads report profiling data at safe points to reduce overhead and increase accuracy, and method timing and tracing give more precise, detailed call durations and call stack information. \nCompact Object Headers (JEP 519) shrink the object header on 64-bit JVMs from its larger experimental form to a compact 64-bit layout. This reduces memory overhead (especially with many small objects) and improves garbage collection (GC) and cache behavior. \nGenerational Shenandoah (JEP 521) adds generational GC support to the Shenandoah garbage collector so that young-generation objects can be collected more efficiently, reducing pause times and improving throughput for workloads with many short-lived objects.\nMoving from Java 21 to Java 25\nIf you are upgrading to Java 25 from Java 21, here is an overview of some of the stable features you might not be familiar with yet.\nStream Gatherers (JEP 485)\nStream Gatherers were added in Java 24. They improve the Stream API, added in Java 8. Stream gatherers allow you to add your own custom intermediate operations to a stream.\nFor an explanation of this feature and how you can use it, watch the following livestream with José Paumard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like more background information on this feature, you might be interested in the following video we created when this feature was still in preview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we highly recommend this video from JavaOne by Viktor Klang, the creator of the feature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Documentation Comments (JEP 467)\nMarkdown documentation comments were added in Java 23. As the name suggests, it is now possible to use Markdown in your JavaDoc. Back when Java was first created, HTML seemed like a logical choice for JavaDoc, but these days you might prefer Markdown. \nIntelliJ IDEA supports the adoption of this feature by offering a quick-fix to convert JavaDoc to Markdown. If you have JavaDoc that you would like to convert, press Alt+Enter when the cursor is on your JavaDoc and select the Convert to Markdown documentation comment option.\nConverting a documentation comment to Markdown\n\n\n\nDoes this mean you should convert your existing JavaDoc to Markdown? Not necessarily. You might just consider writing your documentation in Markdown from now on. However, should you want to convert it, IntelliJ IDEA can help you.\nFor more information on this feature, have a look at Markdown in Java Docs? Shut Up and Take My Comments! by Mala Gupta.\nIf you’re interested in more background on this feature, check out the video that was created when it was still in preview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed Variables & Patterns (JEP 456)\nUnnamed variables and patterns make it possible to use unnamed variables and unnamed patterns when variable declarations or nested patterns are required but the actual variables or patterns are not used. Denoting unnamed variables and patterns with an _ clearly conveys that they are not used elsewhere in the code. IntelliJ IDEA will detect when an unused local variable could be replaced with an underscore _ and offer a quick-fix to do so. \nRenaming a variable to ‘_’\n\n\n\nFor more details on this feature, see Drop the Baggage: Use ‘_’ for Unnamed Local Variables and Patterns in Java 22 by Mala Gupta.\nVirtual Threads (JEP 444) and Synchronize Virtual Threads without Pinning (JEP 491)\nAdded in Java 21, virtual threads are lightweight threads. Unlike platform threads, which are limited by the number of cores in your machine, you can create a potentially unlimited number of virtual threads. Virtual threads improve the scalability of your applications. They do need platform threads to perform their work, but can release them when they are waiting for blocking code. Tooling like jcmd and IntelliJ IDEA can collect thread dumps with virtual threads included.\nSynchronizing virtual threads without pinning (added in Java 24) improves the scalability of Java code that uses synchronized code. Virtual threads that block in synchronized blocks now release their underlying platform threads so they can be used by other virtual threads. This last improvement comes for free when you upgrade from Java 21 to Java 24 or higher. To see this in action, watch the demo we did in the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuntime and security improvements\nJava 24 introduced some changes related to post-quantum cryptography readiness. The Java platform is preparing for the future of secure computing: \nQuantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (JEP 496) and Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (JEP 497), introduced in Java 24, are NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (lattice-based) aimed at replacing or augmenting classic public-key operations like RSA and ECDSA. Java also receives a performance boost. Garbage collection, memory footprint, and startup times all see measurable improvements:\nRegion Pinning for G1 (JEP 423) allows the G1 garbage collector to continue collecting parts of the heap even when some regions are in JNI critical sections. Instead of stalling GC during such critical regions, only “pinned” regions are excluded, reducing latency in mixed JNI/native workloads. \nThe Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 454), added in Java 22, offers better performance and safety over the old JNI for foreign memory and calling native code. Bulk operations are more efficient, with less overhead in cross-boundary calls. \nZGC: Generational Mode by Default (JEP 474). The Z Garbage Collector, which is typically low-pause, uses generational mode by default starting with Java 23. Separation between young and old objects improves GC efficiency for applications that create many short-lived objects.\nAdditionally, there are further enhancements to core libraries, previews, and performance ergonomics – for example, improvements to default GC settings, memory management, etc. \nUpgrading from Java 21 to 25\nYou can find a video series that covers the Road to Java 25 on the official Java YouTube channel. We recommend watching How to Upgrade to Java 25 by Nikolai Parlog. The Oracle DevRel team also has a Java 25 livestream on September 16, 2025.\nConclusion\nAs you have seen, several additions to the language make Java easier to use, both for students and teachers, as well as experienced programmers. In fact, these features completely change the experience of using Java, by no longer requiring boilerplate code like the public static void main(String[] args) method, allowing statements before super(), offering the possibility to add custom intermediary operations in streams using gatherers, allowing underscores as variable names for unused variables, and and providing scoped values as a convenient, safe, and scalable alternative to ThreadLocal. With all of these changes, Java is moving forward fast. IntelliJ IDEA aims to move just as quickly by supporting these new features with relevant inspections and quick-fixes, as well as new live templates, and integrating them into existing features like the debugger. Other than improvements in the language, there are also runtime improvements that you get for free when upgrading your JDK.\nWe think Java 25 is the best Java release (so far!) and we recommend you switch to it as soon as you can. Even if you’re not using the Java language features, you will still benefit from using the new JDK. Java 25 offers a new baseline for the language, and the runtime is the fastest it has ever been.\nIf you are on Java 21, we have provided an overview of what you might have missed in terms of language features. And if you’re on an even older version of Java, now would be the time to start the process to upgrade, not just because of the benefits to you but also because the ecosystem is moving forward. Java 17 is the current baseline for Spring and Spring Boot as of Spring 6 or Spring Boot 3. The upcoming Maven 4 will require JDK 17 to run. But don’t worry, you can still compile projects with older Java versions! The upcoming JUnit 6 is also targeting JDK 17. If you are still on Java 8 (or older), now is the time to start upgrading!\nIntelliJ IDEA will continue to support the latest Java features with Java 26. If you would like to try them out, you can download the EA versions from inside IntelliJ IDEA as soon as they become available. And, as always, please let us know if you have any feedback.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to announce that Visual Studio now supports MCP prompts, resources, and sampling (with even more coming soon!) to enhance your Copilot experience by bringing in more context from your engineering stack. These powerful new features unlock deeper integrations with your favorite tools and services, making your development workflow more intelligent and context aware.\nTry MCP in Visual Studio\n\nLet’s dive into each of these features and discuss some examples with specific MCP servers that can truly level up your AI-coding experience.\nMCP Resources and Resource Templates: Access External Data Seamlessly\nModel Context Protocol also provides a standardized way for servers to expose resources to clients. Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information. Each resource is uniquely identified by a URI, allowing you to get even more out of your MCP servers and pull in context directly in the IDE.\nExample: Azure DevOps Work Items\nWhen working with Azure DevOps, you can now reference work items, user stories, and project data directly in your chat conversations. The Azure DevOps MCP server exposes resources like work item templates, sprint information, and team capacity data that Copilot can use to provide more contextual suggestions about your project planning and development tasks.\n\nUsing MCP Resources\nTo use any MCP resources available to you, reference them in Copilot chat the same way you would reference any other piece of context – with a hashtag (#) followed by the resource URI.\nResource Templates for Dynamic Content\nJust like with prompts, MCP resources can have arguments that you can fill in to customize the resource for your specific needs. These are called resource templates. To configure them:\nUse the + Reference button in chat\nSelect the MCP resource option from the menu\nChoose your resource template and fill in any required arguments\nClick Add Resource to make this MCP resource referenceable in chat\nExample: Figma Design Context\nFor teams working closely with design systems, the Figma MCP server allows you to reference design components, style guides, and design specifications directly in your development conversations. This bridges the gap between design and development by making design context readily available to Copilot.\n\nMCP Prompts and Prompt Templates: Get Better Responses with Specialized Instructions\nMCP Prompts allow servers to provide structured messages and instructions for interacting with language models that are catered to the use case and content of the server in question, ensuring that you will get the best responses for a certain task.\nHow to Use MCP Prompts\nVisual Studio now allows you to discover available prompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them. To reference any prompts that may come from an MCP server:\nClick the + Reference button in chat\nSelect the Prompts option\nChoose MCP prompts from the flyout\nYou’ll see a pop-up where you can select the prompt you’d like to use, then click Insert Prompt to include the text from this prompt in chat.\nPrompt Templates with Custom Arguments\nSome MCP prompts will have arguments that you can fill in to customize the prompt for your specific needs – these are known as prompt templates. If you select a prompt in the modal dialog that contains arguments, you’ll be able to specify those values before inserting the prompt into chat.\nExample: GitHub Integration\nImagine you’re working on code reviews and want to leverage GitHub’s specialized prompts. With the GitHub MCP server, you can access prompts specifically designed for analyzing pull requests, generating commit messages, or reviewing code changes. These prompts understand GitHub’s context and can provide more targeted assistance than generic prompts.\n\nMCP Sampling: Enabling Advanced Agentic Behaviors\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors by enabling LLM calls to occur nested inside other MCP server features. This powerful feature allows an MCP server to make requests of an LLM, rather than the typical workflow of an LLM requesting content from an MCP server. Visual Studio now supports this advanced capability, allowing your MCP servers to perform more complex, multi-step tasks on your behalf.\nHow Sampling works\nThere’s nothing to configure to take advantage of sampling – as long as your MCP server supports it, Visual Studio will too. When Copilot determines that a request would benefit from a sampling call, you’ll see a dialog containing all details of the request, asking you to confirm the sampling call before anything happens behind the scenes. This ensures you maintain full control over any automated actions.\nExample: Playwright testing scenarios \nThe Playwright MCP server can use sampling to automatically generate comprehensive test scenarios based on your application’s current state. When you ask for help with testing, it might sample your application’s DOM structure, analyze user flows, and then generate targeted test scripts that cover critical user paths – all through intelligent sampling calls that you approve.\n\nGetting Started\nThese new MCP capabilities are available now in Visual Studio. To get the most out of these features, we recommend exploring the MCP servers that align with your development workflow. Each server brings unique prompts, resources, and potentially sampling capabilities that can significantly enhance your Copilot experience.\nTry out some other popular MCP servers in Visual Studio with one-click:\n – Discover and install custom prompts and instructions for GitHub Copilot.\n – Convert various file formats (PDF, Word, Excel, images, audio) to Markdown.\n – Query and analyze data in DuckDB databases locally and in the cloud.\n – Database operations and management. Execute queries, manage collections, aggregation pipelines, and document operations.\n – Access models, datasets, and Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub.\nThe seamless integration of external tools and services through MCP represents a major step forward in creating a truly connected development environment. By bringing context from your entire engineering stack directly into your IDE, these features help Copilot provide more accurate, relevant, and actionable assistance for your daily development tasks.\nGive us your feedback!\nWe’re excited to continue evolving the MCP experience in VS, and your input plays a big role—please give us your feedback here, and let us know what you’d like to see next!\nTry MCP in Visual Studio\n\nThe post Getting the most out of MCP in Visual Studio with Prompts, Resources, and Sampling appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

LLM, RAG, 에이전트 등 AI 관련 기능을 시각적으로 쉽게 조합할 수 있다.\n\n\n\nFlowiseAI/Flowise: Build AI Agents, Visually\n\n\n\nAI 개발에 최적화: RAG(문서 기반 답변) 챗봇이나 AI 에이전트를 매우 쉽고 빠르게 만들 수 있다.\n직관적인 UI: AI 모델과 프롬프트를 연결하는 과정이 시각적이고 간단하여 입문자가 사용하기 좋다.\n빠른 프로토타이핑: AI 챗봇 아이디어를 몇 분 만에 테스트 가능한 프로토타입으로 만들 수 있다.\n\n\n제한적인 자동화 기능: 다른 앱(슬랙, 구글 시트 등)과 연동하여 복잡한 업무 자동화를 구현하는 기능은 약하다.\n챗봇 외 기능 부족: 사용자와 상호작용하는 챗봇이나 채팅 API 외의 다른 종류의 앱을 만들기 어렵다.\n\n\n반면 n8n은 서로 다른 앱과 서비스들을 연결하여 반복적인 업무를 자동화하는 워크플로우를 만드는 데 강력하다. AI 모델을 자동화의 한 단계로 사용할 수는 있지만, Flowise처럼 RAG나 에이전트 같은 복잡한 AI 로직을 설계하기는 어렵다. 사용자 화면을 만드는 기능이 없어 순수하게 백엔드 자동화에만 집중한다.\n\n레퍼런스\n\nFlowise For 🦜🔗LangChain.

CV는 0~63 사이의 정수로 표현되는 6bit 값으로, 광고주는 64 가지 값에 매핑하여 사용자의 앱 설치 후 행동을 수집할 수 있다. 예를 들어 CV가 1이면 튜토리얼 완료, CV가 2이면 최초 인앱 구매 완료 등의 값을 사전에 정의, Postback 시점에 획득하여 사용자를 분석할 수 있다. 알고 있겠지만 6bit 는 메우 제한된 값으로, CV를 단독으로 이용하여 사용자를 특정할 방법은 없다.\n말하자면 Apple 은 데이터 측정의 심판이자 유일한 처리자 역할을 자처한다. 광고주, Ad Network 는 모두 Apple 이 정해둔 엄격한 규칙 안에서 Apple이 제공하는 최종 결과물을 수동적으로 받아 해석해야 한다.\nAndroid 의 Privacy Sandbox와 Attribution Reporting API\n앞서 Apple이 모든 Attribution 획득 경로에 관여, 통제하면서 결과만 전달하는 방식과는 대조적으로, Google은 광고 생태계 참여자들이 개인정보 보호 기술을 기반으로 자체적인 프라이버시 보호 솔루션을 구축할 수 있도록 빌딩블록을 제공한다. 그 핵심 빌딩블록이 바로 Privacy Sandbox 이다.\nPrivacy Sandbox는 다음 3가지 핵심 목표를 갖는다.\n기존의 추적 메커니즘을 대체할 새로운 개인정보 보호기술을 구축하는 것.\n퍼블리셔와 개발자가 침해적인 추적 없이도 무료 온라인 컨텐츠를 계속 제공할 수 있도록 지원하는 것.\n업계와의 협력을 통해 새로운 인터넷 개인정보 보호 표준을 구축하는 것.\n요약하면, 개인정보를 보호하면서도 퍼블리셔와 개발자가 광고 기반 비즈니스를 지속할 수 있도록 하는 업계 표준을 만드는 것이다.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle의 Privacy Sandbox가 기존의 Attribution 획득방식과 기술적으로 가장 크게 구별되는 부분은 사용자 디바이스 안에서 Ad Network 정보와 매칭되는 Attribution을 만들어낸다는 점이다.\n디바이스 안에서 Attribution을 획득하기 때문에 광고 비즈니스 사업자는 사용자의 개인정보를 디바이스 밖으로 빼내지 넘기지 않고도 유의미한 사용자 전환 정보를 얻을 수 있다.\n이렇게 사용자 단말에서 생성된 익명화된 Attribution은 Attribution Reporting API(줄여서 ARA)를 통해 수집된다.\nARA를 통해 수집되는 리포트는 크게 2가지 유형이 존재한다.\nEvent-Level Report: “어떤 광고가 전환을 유도했는가?”와 같이 제한적이지만 세분화된 정보\nSummary Reports: “캠페인의 총매출액과 ROI는 얼마인가?”와 같이 구매 금액 등 상세한 전환 데이터를 암호화 및 집계된 형태로 제공\nEvent Level Report는 익명화된 개별 정보이다. 개별정보이지만 익명화 되어 있기 때문에 많은 정보가 담겨있지는 않다. Attribution 정보와 사용자 클릭, 조회 등의 이벤트를 매핑한 데이터를 제공한다. 이 리포트는 캠페인 도달율 측정이나 Attribution 집계 등의 용도로 적합하다.\n반면, Summary Report는 사용자 데이터를 집계한 통계 결과물이다. 개별화된 정보는 없지만 전환가치, ROI, 사용자 세그먼트 별 캠페인 성과분석 등 깊이있는 리포트를 제공한다.\n이 데이터들은 암호화된 형태(=encrypted aggregatable report)로 Ad tech platform(Appsflyer, Meta, Applovin 등등..)에게 전달되며, 이 암호화된 데이터를 기반으로 필요한 쿼리를 Cloud Trusted Execution Environment에 위치한 Aggregation Service 에 질의한다.\nCloud Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)?\nTEE란 구글에서 제안하는 보안 기준을 충족하는 & 신뢰할만한 클라우드 제공자의 인프라 위에서 동작하는 격리된 환경이다. TEE의 보안 기준을 충족하면 Ad Tech Platform 기업에서 자체적으로 구축, 운영할 수 있다.\nExecutive Summary\n지금까지 개인정보 보호의 시대에 어떻게 Mobile Attribution 획득 과정이 달라지는지에 대하여 알아보았다. 과거처럼 Deterministic하게 Attribution을 획득하던 시대는 끝났으며 개발자를 포함, 각 이해관계자들은 개인정보 보호의 시대의 Attribution 획득 방식을 준비해야 한다.\n결정론적 시대의 종말: 개인정보 보호 강화로 IDFA, GAID 기반의 1:1 사용자 추적이 불가능해졌다.\n확률론적 시대로의 전환: 이제는 명확한 데이터 대신, 제한된 데이터를 바탕으로 성과를 ‘추론’해야 한다.\nApple (SKAN)의 접근: Apple이 모든 과정을 통제하는 ‘블랙박스’ 방식이다.\nGoogle (샌드박스)의 접근: ‘온디바이스 매칭’ 을 핵심으로, 광고 생태계가 활용할 수 있는 ‘빌딩 블록’ 을 제공한다.\nAd Tech의 역할 변화: MMP, 광고 네트워크 등 Ad Tech는 암호화된 리포트를 받아, 직접 클라우드 보안 환경(TEE)에 ‘Aggregation Service’ 를 구축하고 운영하여 데이터를 처리해야 한다.",

'프롬프트 아티스트': 창의적인 이미지 생성을 위한 마법 젬\n가장 먼저 소개해드릴 젬은 '프롬프트 아티스트'입니다. 이 젬은 정말 혁신적이라고 말할 수 있어요. 사용자가 단순히 \"시작\"이라고 입력하면, 바로 5가지 창의적인 이미지 생성을 '나노바바나 스타일'을 활용하여 도와줍니다. 피규어 제작, 미니어처 상점, 유리병 속 기념품, 건담 모델 피규어, 레고 미니피규어까지, 상상 이상의 결과물을 만들어내죠.\n예를 들어, 피규어 이미지 생성을 해볼까요? 프롬프트 아티스트 젬을 실행한 후 '시작'을 입력합니다. 그러면 5가지 선택사항이 나오는데, 여기서 '1'을 입력하면 피규어 제작 모드로 진입하게 돼요. 젬의 요청에 따라 이미지를 업로드하면 잠시 후 피규어 생성을 위한 최적의 프롬프트가 자동으로 생성되고, 이미지를 생성할지 물어보는데 'Y'를 입력하면 됩니다. 결과물은 정말이지 상상했던 것 이상으로 디테일하고 생동감이 넘쳐서 깜짝 놀랄 거예요.\n미니어처 상점 기능도 정말 유용해요. 특정 제품 이미지를 업로드하면 해당 메이커의 미니어처 상점을 완벽하게 구현해줍니다. 제가 직접 써보니, 정말 눈을 의심할 정도로 섬세하게 표현해주더라고요. 나머지 3가지 옵션인 유리병 속 기념품, 프라모델 피규어, 레고 미니피규어도 여러분이 상상하는 그대로, 아니 그 이상을 보여줄 겁니다. 직접 한번 만들어보시면 제가 왜 이렇게 극찬하는지 아실 거예요.\nhttps://gemini.google.com/gem/18jkG6tveT7paESp9PIKXDQlrVwc5aMxQ?usp=sharing\n  활용 팁: 프롬프트 아티스트는 단순히 이미지를 만드는 것을 넘어, 여러분의 아이디어를 시각화하는 강력한 도구로 활용될 수 있어요. 제품 디자인 구상, 스토리보드 제작, 게임 캐릭터 컨셉 아트 등 무한한 가능성을 탐험해보세요! 비즈니스 기획자나 크리에이터에게는 정말 필수적인 젬이 될 겁니다.\n✍️ 2. '인간처럼 자연스러운 글쓰기': AI 글쓰기의 새로운 지평\n두 번째로 소개해드릴 젬은 '인간처럼 자연스러운 글쓰기' 젬입니다. 이건 정말 혁신적인 연구를 바탕으로 제가 직접 만든 작품인데요. 최근 터키 대학교 연구팀이 발표한 '라다(LADA)'라는 AI가 전 세계적으로 큰 화제가 되었습니다.\n확산 방식 글쓰기(Diffusion Writing)란?\n기존의 챗GPT와 같은 AI는 앞에서부터 한 단어씩 순차적으로 글을 쓰는 '순차 방식'을 사용합니다. 하지만 라다는 전체 문장을 조망하며 빈칸을 채워나가는 '확산 방식'으로 글을 쓰죠. 마치 십자말풀이를 풀 듯이, 글의 전체 구조를 먼저 잡고 여러 번의 수정을 거쳐 글의 완성도를 높이는 과정과 같다고 보시면 돼요.\n이 연구 결과가 정말 충격적이었어요. 라다가 쓴 글의 자연스러움 점수가 44.6점으로, 인간이 쓴 글의 43.0점과 거의 똑같았거든요. 반면 기존 AI는 18.4점으로 너무 뻔하고 기계적이라는 평을 받았죠. 심지어 기존 AI 탐지 프로그램들이 라다의 글을 전혀 찾아내지 못했다고 합니다. 정말이지 놀랍지 않나요?\n구분\n자연스러움 점수 (45점 만점)\nAI 탐지 가능성\n\n\n\n\n인간이 쓴 글\n43.0점\n없음\n\n\n확산 방식 AI (라다)\n44.6점\n낮음 (탐지 불가)\n\n\n기존 순차 방식 AI\n18.4점\n높음 (탐지 가능)\n\n\n\n이 연구에서 영감을 받아 제가 만든 이 젬도 똑같은 확산 방식을 사용합니다. 덕분에 \"정말 정말\" 같은 감정적 반복이나, \"아니 정확히 말하면\" 같은 자연스러운 수정 표현이 글 속에 녹아들게 되죠. 또 인간적인 불완전함을 의도적으로 연출해서 \"제가 겪어본 바로는\", \"솔직히 놀랐다\" 같은 개인적 경험이나 감정 표현을 자연스럽게 넣어줍니다. 이렇게 하면 정말로 사람이 쓴 것 같은, 개성 있는 글이 탄생해요. 제가 직접 사용해보고 감탄했던 부분입니다.\n사용법도 간단해요. 젬을 실행하고 '시작'을 입력하면 주제를 묻습니다. 예를 들어 '기적을 부르는 아침 습관'이라고 입력해볼게요. 그러면 바로 지침에 맞게 사람이 쓴 것처럼 자연스러운 문장으로 작성이 시작됩니다. 결과물 마지막에는 여러 추가 옵션이 보이는데, '블로그 포스팅 느낌'이라고 입력하면 요청사항에 적합한 글로 재구성해주고요. 원래 가지고 있는 글이 있다면 '아래 원문을 지침에 맞게 수정해'라고 입력하고 원문을 추가하여 요청하면 됩니다. 이 젬은 글쓰기 작업의 효율과 퀄리티를 동시에 끌어올려 줄 거예요.\nhttps://gemini.google.com/gem/1kyeSU63W3CQUvyM3CbleIDwnt2mYR5Tn?usp=sharing\n⚠️ 주의: AI가 생성한 글을 무조건적으로 자신의 것으로 사용하기보다는, 최종 검토와 수정을 거쳐 여러분만의 개성을 더하는 것이 중요합니다. AI는 훌륭한 조력자이지만, 창의적인 영감과 인간적인 감성은 여전히 우리의 몫이니까요. 글의 맥락과 감성을 더욱 풍부하게 만들 수 있다는 점 잊지 마세요.\n  3. 'MBTI 진단 챗봇': 심리 분석을 넘어선 몰입형 경험\n세 번째는 'MBTI 진단 챗봇' 젬인데요. 이건 정말 재미있으면서도 실용적인 젬입니다. 요즘 MBTI가 정말 인기잖아요? 특히 한국에서는 거의 필수 대화 주제가 되었다고 해도 과언이 아니죠. 사람들은 자신을 이해하고 타인을 알아가는 도구로 MBTI를 적극적으로 활용하고 있어요.\n\n\n사용자가 \"시작\"이라고 입력하면 바로 두 가지 선택지가 나타납니다. 표준 MBTI 진단과 한국인 맞춤형 MBTI 진단 중에서 선택할 수 있어요. 여기서 정말 중요한 건 단순히 텍스트 기반으로 질문과 답변을 주고받는 게 아니라는 점입니다. 이 젬의 가장 큰 특징은 완전한 HTML 웹 애플리케이션 형태로 진단을 진행한다는 거예요. 마치 전문적인 심리 진단 웹사이트에 들어온 것 같은 느낌을 받을 수 있어서 사용자 경험이 아주 뛰어나답니다.\n특히 '한국인 맞춤형 진단'은 우리나라 문화와 정서에 맞는 질문들로 구성되어 있어요. 예를 들어 회식 문화라든지, 눈치 보는 상황, 집단주의적 성향 등 한국 사회의 특수한 상황들을 반영한 질문들이 포함되어 있죠. 그래서 진단을 받는 사람들이 훨씬 더 몰입하고 공감할 수 있습니다.\n그리고 진단 결과도 단순히 \"당신은 ENFP입니다\"로 끝나는 게 아니라, 각 성향별로 상세한 설명과 함께 한국 사회에서 그 성격 유형이 어떤 강점과 약점을 가지는지, 어떤 직업이나 관계에서 잘 맞는지까지 구체적으로 알려줍니다. 이렇게 자세하고 시각적인 결과지는 자신을 이해하는 데 정말 큰 도움이 돼요. 제가 직접 해보니, 제 MBTI에 대한 새로운 통찰을 얻을 수 있었어요!\nhttps://gemini.google.com/gem/1CCoR57Ys_cpK6ws1nWdgEMkL3GZ1RQcc?usp=sharing\n  흥미로운 점: MBTI 챗봇은 단순한 진단 도구가 아니라, 자신을 이해하고 타인과의 관계를 개선하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있는 자기 성찰의 기회를 제공합니다. 결과지를 통해 자신의 강점을 극대화하고 약점을 보완할 방법을 찾아보세요. 친구들과 함께 해보는 것도 좋은 대화 주제가 될 거예요.\n  4. '지피티 팍의 사주명리학 마스터': 전통과 현대 기술의 만남\n네 번째 젬은 '지피티 팍의 사주명리학 마스터'입니다. 이 젬은 정말 대단한데요. 30년 경력의 사주명리학 전문가라는 페르소나를 가지고 있어서 사주팔자, 오행, 십신의 관계를 깊이 있게 분석해줍니다. 마치 오랜 시간 한 길을 걸어온 장인에게 상담받는 느낌을 받을 수 있어요.\n하지만 여기서 끝이 아니에요. 이 젬의 진짜 혁신적인 부분은 분석 결과를 현대적이고 시각적인 HTML 리포트로 제작해준다는 점입니다. 기존의 사주 해석이 단순히 텍스트로만 나열되는 것과는 완전히 차원이 다르죠. 저는 이 기능을 처음 봤을 때 '와, 드디어 AI가 여기까지 왔구나!' 하고 솔직히 놀랐습니다.\n실제로 생성되는 리포트를 보면 정말 놀라실 거예요. 먼저 기본 정보부터 시작해서 사주팔자를 아름다운 표 형태로 정리해줍니다. 시주, 일주, 월주, 년주별로 간지, 천간, 지지, 그리고 각각의 의미까지 체계적으로 보여주죠. 특히 오행 분석 부분에서는 목, 화, 토, 금, 수 각각의 개수에 따라 실시간으로 막대그래프가 생성됩니다. 이렇게 시각화된 오행 분포를 보면 자신의 오행 밸런스가 한눈에 들어와요. 어떤 오행이 부족하고 어떤 오행이 과한지 직관적으로 파악할 수 있어서 정말 유용합니다.\n시각적인 사주명리학 리포트의 특징\n✓ 체계적인 기본 정보: 사주팔자를 시주, 일주, 월주, 년주별로 간지, 천간, 지지, 의미까지 명확하게 정리한 표로 제공합니다.\n✓ 오행 분포 막대그래프: 목, 화, 토, 금, 수 각각의 개수에 따른 시각적인 막대그래프를 통해 오행 밸런스를 한눈에 파악할 수 있어요. 어떤 기운이 강하고 약한지 직관적으로 알 수 있죠.\n✓ 상세한 운세 분석: 일간 분석부터 종합 총운, 2025년 기준 띠별 운세, 직장운 상세 분석, 그리고 인생을 위한 최종 조언까지 방대한 정보를 제공합니다.\n✓ 구체적인 인생 조언: 추천 직업 분야 3가지와 함께 인생 전반에 걸쳐 도움이 될 만한 실질적인 조언을 아끼지 않습니다.\n이 정도 퀄리티면 유료 서비스와 비교해도 전혀 손색이 없을 것 같습니다. 전통적인 지혜를 현대적인 방식으로 경험하고 싶은 분들께 강력히 추천하는 젬이에요.\nhttps://gemini.google.com/gem/1Wcs70RsZ520mxo4NCAFrvAudsLHUtm3y?usp=sharing\n  5. '나의 완벽한 비서': 복잡한 업무를 체계적으로 해결\n마지막으로 소개할 젬은 '나의 완벽한 비서'입니다. 이 젬은 정말 혁신적이라고 할 수 있어요. 단순한 질의응답 AI가 아니라, 사용자를 직속 상관으로 모시는 '수석 비서'라는 정체성을 가지고 있습니다. 제가 직접 써보니, 마치 옆에 진짜 비서가 있는 듯한 착각마저 들더라고요.\n이 비서 젬의 가장 큰 특징은 어떤 주제든 깊이 있는 전문적 분석을 하면서도 누구나 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 설명한다는 점이에요. 마치 정말 경험 많은 수석 비서가 복잡한 업무를 체계적으로 정리해서 보고하는 것 같은 느낌을 받을 수 있습니다. 응답 구조도 정말 체계적이에요. 모든 답변이 '업무 처리 결과'로 시작해서 '핵심 솔루션', '실무 팁', '주의사항' 순서로 구성됩니다. 이렇게 표준화된 형식 덕분에 어떤 질문을 해도 일관성 있고 체계적인 답변을 받을 수 있다는 장점이 있죠.\n핵심 비서 젬의 특별한 기능들\n✓ 전문성과 쉬운 설명의 조화: 어떤 주제든 깊이 있는 분석을 하면서도 초보자도 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록 명쾌하게 설명해줍니다.\n✓ 체계적인 응답 구조: 모든 답변이 '업무 처리 결과' → '핵심 솔루션' → '실무 팁' → '주의사항' 순서로 일관성 있게 구성됩니다.\n✓ 실무에 바로 적용 가능한 팁: 단순히 이론적인 설명으로 끝나는 것이 아니라, 각 단계마다 즉시 활용할 수 있는 구체적인 조언을 제공하여 실질적인 도움을 줍니다. 예를 들어 이메일 작성법을 물어보면 \"이런 상황에서는 이 표현을 쓰면 더 효과적입니다\"라는 식으로 실전 팁까지 알려줘요.\n✓ 명확한 의도 파악: 질문이 불명확할 때는 절대로 추측해서 답변하지 않습니다. 대신 \"정확한 처리를 위해 확인드리겠습니다\"라고 하면서 의도를 명확히 파악하기 위한 재질문을 던져요. 이런 세심한 배려가 정말 전문 비서 같은 느낌을 줍니다.\n✓ 최신 정보 반영 및 후속 업무 제안: 최신 정보가 필요한 경우에는 자동으로 웹 검색을 수행해서 정확하고 시의적절한 정보를 제공해줍니다. 그리고 답변이 끝나면 항상 3가지씩 후속 업무를 제안하여 여러분이 놓칠 수 있는 부분까지 꼼꼼히 챙겨줘요.\n예를 들어 '상사에게 프로젝트 지연을 보고하는 이메일을 어떻게 작성해야 할까?' 라고 물어보면, 전략과 함께 구체적인 메일 작성 예시, 실질적인 실무 팁, 그리고 후속 업무까지 완벽하게 제안합니다. 이 젬 하나면 어떤 업무든 든든하게 처리할 수 있을 거예요.\nhttps://gemini.google.com/gem/1ynkFjznk0FlHuiVd_hedJuW-SA7pNH0g?usp=sharing\n  핵심 요약\n✓ 2025년 제미나이 젬 공유 기능 출시: 이제 누구나 자신만의 맞춤형 AI를 만들고 공유할 수 있게 되었습니다.\n✓ 5가지 고퀄리티 젬 무료 공개: 이미지 생성, 자연스러운 글쓰기, MBTI 진단, 사주 분석, 전문 비서 등 다양한 분야를 커버합니다.\n✓ 확산 방식 AI 글쓰기: 인간과 구별하기 어려운 자연스러운 문장 생성으로 AI 탐지 회피 가능성이 높습니다.\n✓ AI 활용의 새로운 패러다임: 이제 AI는 단순한 도구를 넘어, 각자의 필요에 완벽히 맞춰진 전문 파트너가 될 수 있습니다.\n이 젬들을 통해 여러분의 일상과 업무 효율이 극적으로 향상될 것입니다. 직접 경험해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 제미나이 젬은 챗GPT의 GPTs와 어떻게 다른가요?\nA: 기능적인 측면에서는 사용자 맞춤형 AI를 만들고 공유한다는 점에서 유사하지만, 제미나이 젬은 구글의 강력한 멀티모달 기능과 연동되어 더욱 다양한 형태의 상호작용과 콘텐츠 생성이 가능하다는 장점이 있습니다. 특히 HTML 렌더링을 통한 시각적 결과물 제공은 차별화된 부분이에요. 제 생각엔 이 부분이 제미나이 젬의 핵심적인 강점이라고 봅니다.\nQ2: 젬을 직접 만들려면 어떤 지식이 필요할까요?\nA: 기본적인 프롬프트 엔지니어링 개념만 있다면 누구나 쉽게 젬을 만들 수 있습니다. 복잡한 코딩 지식은 필요 없으며, 마치 대화하듯이 젬의 페르소나와 지시사항을 입력하는 방식으로 제작할 수 있어요. 구글에서 제공하는 가이드라인을 참고하시면 더욱 빠르게 익힐 수 있습니다. 저도 처음에는 어렵게 생각했는데, 해보니 정말 별거 아니더라고요.\nQ3: 오늘 공개된 젬들은 모두 무료로 사용할 수 있나요?\nA: 네, 오늘 소개해 드린 5가지 고퀄리티 젬은 모두 무료로 공개되어 있습니다. 제미나이 젬 공유 플랫폼을 통해 누구나 쉽게 찾아 사용해볼 수 있어요. 여러분의 AI 활용 경험을 한 단계 업그레이드할 절호의 기회이니 꼭 사용해보시길 바랍니다. 제가 직접 만들어보니 정말 아낌없이 드리고 싶은 마음이랄까요!\n자, 이렇게 해서 제가 그동안 혼자만 몰래 아껴두었던 '고퀄리티 젬' 5가지를 모두 소개해드렸습니다. 솔직히 저도 이걸 공개하면서 아쉬운 마음이 들지만, 여러분의 AI 활용 경험이 한 단계 더 성장할 수 있다면 그걸로 충분하다고 생각합니다. 정말로요!\n앞으로도 더 유용하고 혁신적인 AI 활용 팁들을 가지고 여러분을 찾아뵙겠습니다. 직접 이 젬들을 경험해보시고, 여러분만의 창의적인 활용법을 발견해보시는 건 어떨까요? 제미나이 젬이 가져올 AI의 새로운 시대를 함께 만들어가요!",

        "contentSnippet": "30년 검색의 종말? 구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순한 검색 기능 업그레이드를 넘어 검색 생태계와 AI 산업 전반에 근본적인 변화를 가져오고 있습니다. 2025년 한국에 정식 출시된 제미나이 2.5 기반의 이 혁신적인 도구가 어떻게 우리의 정보 탐색 방식을 바꾸고, 미래 검색의 방향을 제시하는지 자세히 알아봅니다.\n  구글 AI 모드, 도대체 무엇이 다르죠?\n\n\n음, 2025년 9월 한국에 정식 출시된 구글 AI 모드는 정말이지 기존 검색의 판도를 완전히 뒤집는다고 해도 과언이 아니에요. 단순히 몇몇 기능을 추가한 수준이 아니라, 검색 생태계와 AI 산업 전반에 걸쳐 근본적인 변화를 가져올 혁신적인 도구라고 저는 생각합니다. 제미나이 2.5 맞춤형 버전을 기반으로 하는 이 AI 모드는 사실 기존 AI Overview의 확장된 개념인데요, 가장 핵심적인 특징은 바로 '쿼리 팬-아웃(query fan-out)' 기술이 아닐까 싶어요.\n이 기술, 정말 대단하죠. 사용자가 복잡한 질문을 던지면 AI가 이를 여러 개의 하위 주제로 똑똑하게 분해합니다. 그리고는 각 주제에 대해 동시에 검색을 수행해서 종합적이고 아주 풍부한 답변을 척척 만들어내죠. 예를 들어, 저도 해봤는데, \"7세와 4세 아이 2명과 서울에서 1시간 거리로 주말에 함께 갈 수 있는 한적한 여행지\" 같은 복잡한 요청도 한 번에 깔끔하게 처리해주더라고요. 이런 경험은 기존 검색에서는 상상하기 어려웠던 부분이죠. 솔직히 말하면, 제가 겪어본 바로는 정말 혁신적이에요!\n멀티모달 검색 경험의 확장\n구글 AI 모드는 텍스트만 처리하는 것이 아니라, 음성과 이미지까지 지원하는 진정한 멀티모달 검색 경험을 제공합니다. 마이크 버튼 하나로 음성 질문을 하거나, 구글 렌즈와 연동해서 사진 한 장만으로도 복잡한 질문을 할 수 있어요. 얼마 전 해외여행에서 써봤는데, 식당 메뉴판을 사진으로 찍고 \"채식주의자가 먹을 수 있는 메뉴 알려줘\"라고 물으니, 번역은 물론이고 조건에 맞는 추천까지 해주더라고요. 정말이지 여행의 질이 달라지는 경험이었어요!\n딥 서치와 개인 맞춤형 기능으로 한 단계 더!\n여기서 끝이 아닙니다. AI 모드에서는 수백 건의 검색을 동시에 진행해서 전문가 수준의 완벽한 보고서를 단 몇 분 만에 생성하는 딥 서치(Deep Search) 기능도 제공해요. 저처럼 리서치를 많이 하는 사람들에게는 정말이지 빛과 소금 같은 기능이죠. 그리고 사용자의 동의하에 지메일 등 다른 구글 앱과 연동하여 개인 정보를 활용한 맞춤형 답변까지 제공하는데, 이건 정말 개인 비서가 생긴 기분이에요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 기술 요약: 구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 쿼리 팬-아웃 기술로 복잡한 질문을 세분화하여 동시에 검색합니다. 음성/이미지 인식 멀티모달 기능과 수백 건의 동시 검색을 통한 딥 서치 기능이 핵심입니다.\n⚙️ AI 모드, 실생활에서 어떻게 활용할까요?\n구글 AI 모드는 단순히 기술만 발전한 것이 아니라, 우리의 일상과 업무 여러 분야에서 엄청난 잠재력을 가지고 있어요. 제가 직접 써보고 느낀 점들과 함께 몇 가지 활용법을 소개해 드릴게요.\n비즈니스 및 마케팅 분야에서 똑똑하게!\n비즈니스 환경에서 AI 모드는 정말 유용합니다. \"B2B 스타트업을 위한 통합 마케팅 자동화 솔루션 추천해줘\"와 같은 질문을 던져보세요. AI는 이 질문을 'B2B 특화 기능', '스타트업 예산 대응', '마케팅 자동화 도구 비교', '통합 솔루션 장점' 등으로 아주 세분화하여 검색하고, 관련 정보를 깔끔하게 정리해줍니다. 마치 전문 컨설턴트가 짧은 시간 안에 핵심 보고서를 만들어주는 느낌이랄까요? 제가 전에 리서치하던 시간의 절반도 안 걸려서 놀랐어요.\n여행 및 생활 정보 검색도 문제없죠!\n복잡한 여행 계획 수립이나 일상생활 정보 검색에서도 AI 모드의 강점이 빛을 발합니다. \"내년 5월에 열리는 철인 3종 경기를 준비하려고 해. 훈련 시작 전에 알아야 할 점은 무엇이야?\" 같은 다층적인 질문에도 훈련 계획, 영양, 장비, 부상 예방 등 종합적인 답변을 제공해요. 저는 다음 주말 여행 계획을 AI 모드로 짜봤는데, 숙소부터 맛집, 아이들 체험 활동까지 정말 완벽하게 추천해주더라고요. 솔직히 감탄했습니다.\n학술 연구 및 교육 분야의 혁신\n학술 연구와 교육 분야에서도 AI 모드는 혁신적인 도구로 자리매김하고 있습니다. 이제는 이미지나 PDF 파일에 대한 질문 분석 기능이 데스크톱으로도 확장되어, 강의 슬라이드를 업로드하고 관련 질문을 하는 것이 가능해졌어요. 학생들은 복잡한 논문 내용을 빠르게 이해하고, 연구자들은 방대한 자료를 효율적으로 탐색할 수 있게 되는 거죠. 제가 학교 다닐 때 이런 기능이 있었다면 성적이 훨씬 좋았을 것 같아요. (웃음)\n콘텐츠 생성 및 최적화에도 탁월!\nAI 모드는 콘텐츠 마케터들에게도 강력한 도구가 됩니다. 예를 들어, \"네이버 블로그 상위노출 기사 10개의 제목을 분석하고, 이들 기사보다 상위노출이 가능한 최적의 블로그 제목을 생성해줘\"와 같은 요청을 통해 경쟁사 분석과 함께 SEO에 최적화된 제목을 손쉽게 얻을 수 있습니다. 이는 콘텐츠 기획 시간을 크게 단축시키고, 더욱 효과적인 마케팅 전략을 수립하는 데 도움을 줍니다.\n\n\n\n \n시의성 있는 정보 검색 및 기사 작성까지!\n최신 시사 이슈나 정책에 대한 정보가 필요할 때도 AI 모드를 활용할 수 있습니다. \"정부의 2025년 추석 민생 안정대책에 대한 신뢰할 수 있는 자료를 검색하고 블로그 기사를 생성해 (검색대상에 블로그를 제외해)\"와 같이 특정 조건을 지정하여 정보를 요청하면, AI가 신뢰도 높은 자료를 기반으로 관련 기사 초안을 작성해줍니다. 이를 통해 빠르고 정확하게 필요한 정보를 얻고, 생산적인 작업으로 이어갈 수 있습니다.\n\n\n\n \n⚔️ LLM 시장의 격전, 그리고 구글의 전략\n구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순히 검색 기능의 변화를 넘어, 전체 AI 검색 시장의 경쟁을 더욱 치열하게 만들고 있어요. ChatGPT의 SearchGPT, Perplexity AI, Bing AI 등 각자의 강점을 내세우는 경쟁자들이 이미 많이 존재하거든요. 이런 상황에서 구글이 본격적으로 AI 검색 서비스를 도입했다는 건, 시장 판도에 상당한 변화를 가져올 것이라는 의미로 해석될 수 있죠. 제 생각에는 구글이 검색 시장의 주도권을 절대 놓치지 않겠다는 강력한 의지를 보여준 것 같아요.\n⚠️ 주목할 점: 일부 전문가들은 AI 검색이 기존 구글의 검색 점유율 33%를 빼앗아올 수 있다고 분석합니다. 라이너는 학술 검색, Perplexity는 미디어 종사자와 리서처 사이에서 인기를 얻고 있으며, ChatGPT는 LLM 이용자들의 검색 습관을 바꾸고 있어요. 구글도 마냥 안심할 수만은 없는 상황이죠.\nLLM 시장의 자연독점 가능성\n최근 AI 업계에서는 \"LLM 시장이 구글처럼 자연독점이 될 수 있다\"는 전망이 조심스럽게 제기되고 있습니다. 구글의 AI 모드 도입은 이러한 자연독점 구조를 더욱 공고히 할 가능성이 크다고 저는 봐요. 구글이 보유한 강력한 검색 인프라와 방대한 데이터, 그리고 제미나이 2.5 같은 최첨단 AI 모델을 결합하면 경쟁자들이 쉽게 따라잡기 어려운 격차를 만들어낼 수 있겠죠. 아, 그런데 이건 독점이라는 측면에서는 우려가 될 수도 있겠네요.\n\n\n플랫폼별 검색 경험의 분화\nLLM이 모든 앱에 검색 기능을 주입하면서, 이제 검색은 더 이상 Google.com에서만 시작되거나 끝나지 않게 되었습니다. Microsoft Excel에서 쿠키 레시피를 검색하거나, Meta AI를 통해 WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook에서도 검색할 수 있게 되었으니 말이죠. 구글은 이제 ChatGPT뿐만 아니라 수천 개의 작은 AI 검색 엔진들과도 경쟁해야 하는 상황에 놓인 겁니다. 검색의 정의 자체가 확장되고 있다는 느낌이에요.\n  검색 엔진 생태계에 미치는 혁명적 영향\n구글 AI 모드의 도입은 정말이지 검색 생태계 전반에 혁명적인 변화를 가져오고 있다고 저는 확신합니다. 우리 모두의 검색 습관부터 웹사이트 트래픽, 그리고 SEO 전략까지, 모든 것이 바뀌고 있어요.\n검색 행동 패턴의 근본적 변화\nAI Overview가 출시된 이후, 사용자들은 기존 검색보다 2~3배 긴 질문을 하기 시작했어요. 이건 AI가 자연어를 정말 잘 이해할 수 있다는 신뢰가 형성되었기 때문입니다. 전체 검색의 약 20% 정도가 '롱테일 키워드'(요구 사항이 구체적인 긴 검색어)를 차지하는데, 이 비율은 계속 증가하는 추세예요. 이제 사람들은 \"CRM 추천\" 같은 짧은 키워드 대신 \"중소기업에서 사용하기 쉬운 클라우드 기반 CRM 솔루션을 추천해줘\"와 같이 더 자연스러운 문장으로 검색하게 된 거죠. 제가 생각하기에 이런 변화는 정보 탐색의 효율성을 극대화할 거예요.\n제로 클릭 검색 확산과 웹 트래픽의 변화\nAI Overview와 AI 모드의 도입으로 이제 제로 클릭 검색이 더욱 일반화되고 있습니다. 사용자들이 검색 결과에서 바로 답을 얻을 수 있으니, 웹사이트 클릭률(CTR)이 낮아지고 자연 검색 트래픽이 줄어들 가능성이 커졌어요. 최근 데이터에 따르면 전 세계 검색 트래픽이 15% 감소했다는 분석도 있는데, 이게 바로 AI 검색 기능 강화의 영향이라고 합니다. 콘텐츠 제작자들에게는 정말 중요한 변화죠.\nSEO 전략의 패러다임 전환\nAI 검색의 도입은 SEO 전략에 근본적인 변화를 요구하고 있습니다. 이제는 단순히 키워드 최적화를 넘어서, AI가 이해하고 종합할 수 있는 '정보의 질'과 '구조'가 훨씬 더 중요해졌어요. 기업들은 키워드를 통한 검색 최적화에만 매달릴 것이 아니라, AI의 분석 능력을 활용하여 소비자의 실제 요구와 행동 패턴에 맞춘 고품질 콘텐츠 제공에 집중해야 합니다. 이건 마치 새로운 게임의 규칙을 배우는 것과 같아요. 쉬운 일은 아니지만, 반드시 적응해야 합니다.\n\n\n검색 결과의 투명성과 신뢰도 향상\n구글은 AI 모드의 투명성을 높이기 위해 Search Console에 AI 모드에서의 클릭, 노출, 순위 데이터를 통합했어요. 이를 통해 게시자와 사이트 소유자들이 AI 모드가 검색 결과에 미치는 영향을 더 정확하게 파악할 수 있게 되었죠. 게다가 AI 모드는 구글의 기존 품질 및 순위 시스템을 기반으로 작동하며, 신뢰도가 낮을 경우 기존 웹 검색 결과를 그대로 보여주는 보완 장치까지 마련했습니다. AI 답변의 품질이나 유용성에 대한 신뢰도가 충분히 높지 않다면 웹 링크를 제공하여 사용자가 직접 검증할 수 있도록 지원하는 점도 아주 긍정적인 부분이라고 생각해요.\n  핵심 요약\n구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 '쿼리 팬-아웃' 기술로 복잡한 질문을 세분화하여 동시 처리, 기존 검색의 한계를 뛰어넘습니다.\n멀티모달 검색 (음성, 이미지) 및 딥 서치 기능으로 개인 맞춤형, 전문가 수준의 정보를 제공하며 활용 범위를 넓히고 있습니다.\nAI 검색 시장의 경쟁 심화와 LLM 시장의 자연독점 가능성 속에서, 구글은 강력한 인프라로 주도권을 유지하려 합니다.\n제로 클릭 검색 확산, 웹 트래픽 변화, 그리고 '정보의 질'과 '구조' 중심의 SEO 전략 패러다임 전환이 필수적입니다.\n* 미래 검색 환경에 대한 적응과 활용이 중요합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 구글 AI 모드는 기존 검색과 무엇이 다른가요?\nA1: 구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 '쿼리 팬-아웃' 기술을 활용하여 사용자의 복잡한 질문을 여러 하위 주제로 분해, 동시에 검색하고 종합적인 답변을 제공합니다. 이는 기존 검색 엔진이 개별 링크를 나열하는 방식과는 근본적으로 다른, 개인 맞춤형 '답변' 중심의 경험을 선사합니다.\nQ2: AI 모드의 등장으로 SEO 전략은 어떻게 바뀌어야 할까요?\nA2: AI 모드 시대에는 단순한 키워드 최적화를 넘어, AI가 이해하고 종합할 수 있는 '정보의 질'과 '구조'가 가장 중요해집니다. 사용자 질문에 대한 포괄적이고 신뢰성 높은 답변을 제공하며, AI가 콘텐츠를 쉽게 분석하고 활용할 수 있도록 명확하게 구조화된 콘텐츠 제작이 필수적입니다.\nQ3: AI 모드가 웹사이트 트래픽에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?\nA3: AI 모드의 도입으로 '제로 클릭 검색'이 확산될 수 있습니다. AI가 검색 결과에서 바로 종합적인 답변을 제공하기 때문에, 사용자들이 웹사이트를 직접 클릭할 필요가 줄어들어 자연 검색 트래픽이 감소할 가능성이 있습니다. 이는 콘텐츠 제작자들이 단순히 클릭 유도를 넘어 정보 가치 자체에 집중해야 함을 의미합니다.\nQ4: 구글 AI 모드의 미래는 어떻게 전망되나요?\nA4: 구글은 AI 모드를 지속적으로 개선하고 기능을 확장할 계획입니다. 단순한 검색 도구를 넘어 캔버스 기능, 검색 라이브, 개인 맞춤형 차트 및 그래프 생성 등 종합적인 정보 분석 및 생성 플랫폼으로 발전할 것입니다. 궁극적으로는 인덱스 중심의 검색 엔진에서 사용자 의도에 응답하는 '답변 엔진'으로의 전환을 가속화할 것으로 예상됩니다.\n마무리하며: 검색 생태계의 새로운 시대\n구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순히 기술적 진보를 넘어, 30년간 지속되어온 전통적인 검색 방식의 패러다임을 완전히 바꾸는 중요한 이정표라고 생각합니다. AI 기반의 대화형 검색으로 진화하면서 사용자들은 훨씬 더 자연스럽고 효율적인 정보 탐색 경험을 얻게 될 것이 분명해요.\n물론 이러한 변화는 다른 LLM 서비스들과의 경쟁을 더욱 치열하게 만들고 있으며, 각 플랫폼이 고유한 강점을 내세워 시장에서 경쟁하는 상황을 만들어내고 있죠. 동시에 검색 엔진 시장에서는 SEO 전략의 근본적 변화, 제로 클릭 검색의 확산, 그리고 웹 트래픽 패턴의 변화 등 다양한 영향이 나타나고 있습니다. 적응하지 않으면 도태될 수밖에 없을 거예요.\n앞으로 AI 검색 기술이 더욱 발전하고 확산됨에 따라, 콘텐츠 제작자들과 마케터들은 AI가 이해하고 활용할 수 있는 고품질 콘텐츠 제작에 더욱 집중해야 할 것입니다. 그리고 우리 사용자들은 AI가 제공하는 정보의 신뢰성을 비판적으로 검증하고, 다양한 출처를 통해 정보를 확인하는 능력을 기르는 것이 중요하다고 생각해요. 구글 AI 모드가 보여주는 검색의 미래, 이 거대한 변화에 적응하고 활용하는 능력이 바로 다가올 디지털 환경에서 성공하는 핵심 요소가 될 거라고 저는 감히 말씀드립니다. 정말 기대되지 않나요?\n⁂",

DOGE는 진짜다⟩\n토스증권 리서치센터 애널리스트들이 워싱턴 D.C.를 찾은 이유는 트럼프 2기 정부가 출범한 이후 정책이 금융시장에 미치는 영향이 점점 더 커지고 있기 때문입니다.\n이번 출장에서 만난 여러 기업, 싱크탱크, 정부 관계자들 역시 이러한 변화를 인지하고 대응하고 있었습니다. 그들과 이야기를 나누면서 저희는 세 번째 인사이트를 얻었습니다.\n “DOGE는 밈이 아니라, 진짜구나.”\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\nDOGE 얘기부터 꺼내는 \n기업 관계자들\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}DOGE(Department of Government Efficiency)는 트럼프 정부가 신설한 공식 기관으로, ‘정부효율부’라는 뜻입니다. 이름 자체도 그렇고, 공동 수장으로 일론 머스크가 임명됐다는 사실도 ‘이슈 메이킹’에 초점이 맞춰진 듯해 처음엔 다소 농담처럼 여겨졌습니다. 한국 언론 역시 ‘일론 머스크와 트럼프의 긴밀한 관계’에 주목하는 기사를 쏟아냈죠.\n그런데 현장 분위기는 달랐습니다. 우리가 만난 기업 경영진들은 DOGE를 ‘정책의 핵심 축’으로 보고 있었어요. 부동산, IT, 방위산업, 정책 분석 플랫폼 등 전혀 다른 업종의 기업들이 우리가 묻기도 전에 DOGE를 먼저 언급하며 대응 전략을 설명했습니다. 기관투자자들로부터 이미 여러 차례 DOGE 관련 질문을 받아본 듯한 느낌이었죠. 실제로 어닝콜*에서 DOGE를 언급하는 기업들도 점차 늘어나는 추세입니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 기업의 경영진이 실적 발표와 함께 향후 전망을 설명하고 투자자들과 질의응답을 진행하는 행사\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n재정적자의 해결책?\n미국 정부가 ‘효율화’에 박차를 가하는 이유는 만성적인 재정적자 때문입니다. 이는 한두 해 예산 삭감으로 해결될 문제가 아니기에, 아예 전담 조직을 만들어 장기적인 플랜으로 재정 구조를 개혁하려는 것이죠. 미국 정부의 강한 의지를 보여주듯, DOGE는 이미 재정적자 축소에 기여할 수 있는 실질적이고 과감한 시도들을 하고 있습니다.\nDOGE가 하는 일을 한 줄로 요약하면, ‘연방정부의 손익계산서를 면밀히 검토해 불필요한 지출은 줄이고 운영 효율을 높이는 것’입니다.\nDOGE 공식 홈페이지에 따르면 자산 매각, 계약 취소 및 재협상, 사기성 지출 정리, 보조금 축소, 이자 비용 감축, 규제 완화, 인력 감축 등을 통해 총 2,050억 달러의 절감 효과를 거둔 것으로 자체 추산하고 있습니다. 절감 항목과 규모는 매주 홈페이지에 업데이트돼 누구나 쉽게 확인할 수 있습니다.\nAI로 ‘효율화의 효율’ 높이기\nDOGE가 우선적으로 집중하는 분야는 비국방·비긴급 예산입니다. 미국 연방정부 전체 예산 6.75조 달러 중 약 14%를 차지하는 항목인데요. DOGE는 2026년까지 이 영역에서만 1,630억 달러를 절감하겠다는 목표를 세웠습니다.\n\n이를 위해 DOGE는 AI를 적극 활용하고 있습니다. 광범위한 예산 속 비효율을 빠르게 찾아내려면 방대한 데이터를 수집하고 분석해야 하는데, 여기에 AI가 쓰이고 있는 겁니다.\n출범 초기, 일론 머스크와 함께 테슬라 출신 엔지니어들이 DOGE에 참여했다는 소식이 전해졌는데요. 이들이 개발한 ‘규제 완화 결정 도구(DOGE AI Tool)’가 지금은 효율화 작업에 적극 활용되고 있습니다.\n출범 6개월, \nDOGE에 대한 현지 평가\n긍정·부정 평가가 엇갈리긴 했지만, 정부 관계자·언론·싱크탱크·상하원 의원 등은 여전히 DOGE의 영향력에 주목하고 있었습니다. 트럼프 행정부의 인사관리처 수장 스콧 쿠포는 “DOGE의 방식이 다소 강압적이지만, 그러한 시도가 효율화 흐름을 촉발한 것은 사실”이라고 인정했습니다. ‘포브스’와 ‘로이터’는 DOGE가 성공할 경우 정부가 국민을 위해 더 나은 서비스를 제공하는 방향으로 발전할 수 있다는 기대를 내놓기도 했습니다.\n물론 모든 평가가 긍정적인 건 아닙니다. 미국의 싱크탱크 브루킹스(Brookings)는 DOGE가 여러 정부 부처에서 대규모 해고를 단행하며 국정 운영에 차질이 생긴 점을 지적했습니다. 민주당 상원 의원 리처드 블루멘털(Richard Blumenthal)은 “세금 절감은커녕 오히려 세금 낭비를 키웠다”라는 비판적 논조의 보고서를 발표하기도 했습니다.\nDOGE에서 얻을 수 있는\n투자 인사이트\n여기까지 읽고 “효율화든 구조조정이든, 그게 투자자에게 중요한가요?”라고 궁금하실 수 있습니다. 네, 정말 중요합니다. 실제로 현지 관계자들을 만나 보니 몇 가지 투자 인사이트를 얻을 수 있었습니다.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n상업용 부동산 시장이 위축될 수 있습니다. 정부가 계약을 해지하고 사무실을 줄이기 시작했기 때문입니다. 워싱턴 D.C. 지역은 이미 흔들리고 있다고 합니다.\n정부를 주요 고객으로 둔 중소형 협력사들은 더욱 타격이 큽니다. 효율을 중시하게 되면, 계약 하나로 다양한 일을 한꺼번에 맡길 수 있는 대형 기업이 유리하기 때문입니다. 규모가 큰 회사일수록 경험이 풍부하고 업무 역량도 넓어, 시장은 앞으로 이들 중심으로 재편될 가능성이 큽니다.\n국방·보안 기업은 DOGE의 영향에서 자유로워 보였습니다. 국가적으로 워낙 중요한 분야라 국방 예산은 DOGE도 쉽게 손을 대지 못한다고 합니다.\n디지털 전환, 사이버보안 기업에겐 기회가 될 수 있습니다. 정부가 효율화를 위해 IT 시스템 전반을 바꾸고 있어, 관련 기술을 보유한 기업이라면 더 큰 성장 기회를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n\n일론 머스크가 트럼프와 갈등을 빚고 DOGE를 떠났다는 뉴스보다 중요한 건 따로 있습니다. 바로 DOGE가 이끌고 있는 구조적 변화입니다. DOGE는 일시적인 해프닝이 아니라 큰 변화의 시작입니다. 실제로 수많은 기업이 DOGE의 예산 기준에 맞춰 사업 전략을 수정하고 있으며, 이 변화는 각 산업의 수요·수익·리스크 전반에 영향을 미치고 있습니다.\n지금 DOGE를 이해하는 건, 앞으로 미국 정부가 어디에 돈을 쓰고 또 어디에 쓰지 않을지를 파악하는 일입니다. 그리고 그건 기업의 변화를 이해하는 데 점점 더 중요한 요소가 될 것입니다.\n\n💡 다음 글 예고\n\n워싱턴 D.C. 출장 얘기는 이번 편으로 마무리하고, 다음 편에서는 텍사스에서 보고 들은 이야기를 전해드리겠습니다. 미국의 과거, 현재, 미래가 공존하는 텍사스에서 얻은 인사이트를 잘 정리해 가져올 테니 많이 기대해주세요. 감사합니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter 이지선 애널리스트 Edit 기명균 윤동해 Graphic 고영진 최서윤",

A product should never require users to “know” or “learn” how to use it. The simpler the product, the more people use it, and the faster and bigger the service grows.\nBehind every Toss service is rigorous thinking, relentless experimentation, and bold challenges. Along this journey, we have discovered the following 10 principles for creating products that truly succeed.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n01. Casual Concept\nAre complex ideas presented in a way that feels familiar and easy to understand? Here at Toss, we replace technical jargon with everyday language that anyone can grasp instantly.\n02. Simple Policy\nAn intuitive product starts with a simple policy. No matter how polished the UI, if the rules are complicated, the product will feel complicated.\n03. Value First\nIt’s our job to show users that our product is worth their time and money. By clearly communicating its benefits before asking them to act, we guide users seamlessly to complete the task at hand.\n04. Clear Action\nIs the required action to achieve the desired result obvious at a glance? Without reading a word, users should know exactly what to do next.\n05. Context Based\nWas the entire user journey considered in the design? Every product flow should feel natural from beginning to end. A fragmented or forced experience will only push users away.\n06. Easy to Answer\nCan users answer every question within three seconds? If users find something hard to decide, we provide recommendations. When they can’t recall something, we retrieve the information for them. Three simple questions are always better than one difficult one, but none is the best.\n07. Explain Why\nDid users receive a clear explanation of why they needed to complete the action? Never assume what’s obvious to us is obvious to users. Always explain the reason behind an action so they can move forward with confidence.\n08. One Thing\nEach page should deliver a single, clear core message, refined to its essentials.\n09. No More Loading\nHave we completely removed waiting for users? Long wait time drifts users away. Pull all levers to eliminate delays —whether by redesigning flows, improving policies, or adopting new technology.\n10. Minimum Features\nMore features in a product mean more complexity, slower updates, and more bugs. Adding a new feature often brings more cost than value, and should be a last resort.\nFollow us on .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}LinkedIn and explore more detailed updates about Toss.",

이러한 집중 견제는 어떤 결과로 이어질까요?\n이번 글에서는 미국이 중국을 견제하는 이유가 무엇인지, 미·중 갈등이 지속될 경우 투자자는 어떻게 대응해야 하는지를 차근차근 말씀드릴게요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n미국 vs 중국, 4가지 경쟁 구도\n출장에서 만난 현지 전문가들에 따르면, 미국은 관세뿐 아니라 여러 방면에서 중국을 견제하고 있었습니다. 그 말인즉슨, 중국의 부상을 억제하려면 그만큼 복합적인 전략이 필요하다는 의미입니다.\na) 체제 경쟁\n후버 연구소의 조셉 토리지안은 시진핑 주석이 부친의 숙청 경험과 문화대혁명을 반면교사 삼아 ‘중국식 현대화 모델’을 채택했다고 말합니다. 공산당 이념에 디지털 통제를 융합한 이 모델이 장기 집권을 정당화하는 데 쓰이고 있다는 거죠.\n미국이 경계하는 건 이러한 체제가 중국 외 다른 나라로 확산되는 것입니다. 실제로 중국은 우간다, 짐바브웨 같은 아프리카 기업에 AI 기반 감시 카메라나 안면인식 군중분석 시스템 등 감시 인프라를 수출했어요. 이를 두고 허드슨 연구소의 토마스 벤슨은 중국이 전 세계로 확산될 ‘기술 기반 전체주의 모델’을 선도하고 있다고 우려했습니다.\nb) 금융 자본 경쟁\n미국은 중국으로 금융자본이 유입되는 상황에 대해서도 강한 경계심을 갖고 있었습니다. 토마스 벤슨은 특히 미국과 유럽의 자본이 홍콩 증시를 통해 제재 대상인 중국 기업으로 흘러갈 수 있음을 지적했어요.\n예를 들어, 미국은 인권 문제를 이유로 신장 위구르 지역에서 생산된 제품의 수입을 금지하고 있습니다. 하지만 이들 기업도 금융시장을 통하면 미국으로부터 자금을 조달할 수 있죠. 당연히 제재 효과는 약해질 수밖에 없습니다.\nc) 기술 패권 경쟁\nAI, 반도체, 위성 등 첨단 기술은 국가 경쟁력의 핵심으로 여겨져요. 미국이 중국의 기술 발전을 경계하는 이유도 여기에 있습니다. 실제로 미국은 AI 산업의 핵심인 GPU 가 중국으로 수출되는 것에 제한을 두고 있죠.\n우려가 현실로 드러난 사례도 있었습니다. 올해 초 중국 딥시크(Deepseek)가 등장하면서 미국 주식시장에서 엔비디아 등 관련 기업의 주가가 크게 하락한 것입니다. 이후 주가는 회복되었지만, 중국의 기술 발전이 미국의 AI 및 반도체 산업에 타격을 줄 수 있다는 걸 보여준 사건이었어요.\nd) 공급망 확보 경쟁\n코로나19 당시 미국은 면봉이나 시약 같은 기본적인 의료 물품조차 중국에 의존해야 했어요. 쓰라린 경험을 통해 미국은 공급망 확보의 중요성을 새삼 깨달았죠. 이후 미국은 헬스케어 산업뿐 아니라 반도체, 에너지, 클라우드 등 핵심 산업 전반에 걸쳐 공급망 국내화를 추진하고 있습니다.\n바이든 정부가 인플레이션 감축법(IRA)*, 칩스법(Chips Act)** 등 미국 내 에너지/반도체 생산 기업에 보조금을 지급한 것도 공급망 국내화 전략의 일환이었습니다. 칩스법에는 ‘미국에서 보조금을 받는 기업은 중국 내 첨단 반도체 투자를 금지한다’는 조항이 포함되어 있죠. 인플레이션 감축법 또한 ‘중국에서 생산된 소재 및 부품을 사용할 경우 보조금 대상에서 제외한다’는 조건을 담고 있고요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 미국 내에서 생산된 전기차·배터리 등 친환경 산업에 보조금을 주는 법\n** 미국 내 반도체 공장 투자와 생산에 보조금과 세제 혜택을 지원하는 법\n과거 미국이 견제했던 다른 나라들\n미국은 과거에도 특정 국가를 견제한 적이 있습니다. 바로 소련과 일본이에요.\n\na) 소련 - 냉전시대의 경쟁자\n1950년대, 공산주의 진영을 대표하던 소련은 산업화에 성공하며 세계 2위 경제대국으로 올라섰어요. 군사력도 막강했죠. 미국 입장에서는 위기감이 들 수밖에 없었습니다. 그때 미국 외교관 조지 캐넌이 대통령에게 편지 한 통을 보냅니다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n소련은 공산주의 확산을 꿈꾸고 있습니다. 정치, 경제, 외교로 봉쇄해야 해요..css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n이 편지를 계기로 소련 봉쇄 전략이 구체화됐어요.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n마셜 플랜: 유럽 경제 재건 지원으로 소련의 영향력 차단\n나토(NATO): 서유럽 국가들을 군사 동맹으로 묶어 소련 견제\n\n쉽게 말해 미국이 소련을 왕따시킨 셈이었죠. 당시 미·소 갈등은 자유주의와 공산주의의 ‘진영 싸움’이었기에 가능했어요. 결국 막대한 군비 지출에 허덕이던 소련은 붕괴했습니다.\nb) 일본 - 한때 반도체 생산량 1위\n1980년대에는 일본이 미국을 긴장하게 했습니다. 일본의 반도체, 자동차, 전자제품이 세계 시장을 휩쓸면서 미국의 핵심 산업을 위협했거든요. 당시 미국 무역적자의 40%가 일본 때문일 정도였어요.\n미국은 곧바로 대응했습니다. 엔화 가치를 올리는 ‘플라자 합의’로 일본의 수출 경쟁력을 꺾고, 반도체 협정을 맺어 일본 기업들이 만든 반도체의 가격과 시장 점유율에 관여하기 시작했죠.\n미국과의 무역에 기대 성장한 일본에는 뼈아픈 견제였습니다. 결국 일본은 버블 붕괴와 함께 ‘잃어버린 20년’을 맞이하게 됩니다.\n중국과의 싸움은\n조금 더 복잡하고 어렵다\n소련도 눌렀고 일본도 눌렀으니, 중국과의 대결에서도 미국이 간단히 승리할까요? 생각만큼 그리 간단하지 않습니다. 중국은 과거 라이벌인 소련과 일본보다 훨씬 까다로운 상대거든요.\n\n중국은 소련처럼 체제가 달라 동맹을 맺기는 어려운 상대인데, 일본처럼 무역으로 긴밀히 얽혀 있어 완전히 끊어내기도 어렵기 때문입니다. 이른바 ‘복합 경쟁자’인 셈이죠.\n게다가 중국은 과거 소련과 일본의 사례에서 교훈도 얻었어요. 소련처럼 무리한 군비 경쟁에 뛰어들지도 않고, 일본처럼 불리한 협상 테이블에 앉지도 않고 있죠. 대신 수출과 내수 시장을 함께 키우는 ‘쌍순환 전략’으로 버틸 힘을 기르겠다는 영리한 전략을 펴고 있어요.\n투자자는 어떻게 대응해야 할까요?\n1. 장기전을 염두에 두기\n미국과 중국의 갈등은 길어질 거예요. 두 나라의 복잡한 관계를 고려했을 때, 미국과 중국의 갈등이 단기간에 끝나진 않을 거거든요. 그러니 앞으로 장기전이 될 가능성이 높다는 걸 염두에 두셔야 해요.\n2. 기술 패권 경쟁에 주목하기\n기술 패권을 둘러싼 치열한 경쟁은 기술 기업에게 기회가 될 수 있어요.css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}. 두 나라 모두 기술 패권을 유지하는 것이 얼마나 중요한 일인지 잘 알고 있기 때문에, 경쟁이 치열할수록 산업의 성장 속도도 빨라질 거예요. 인공지능, 우주, 로봇 등 기술 패권을 좌우할 분야는 이미 윤곽이 드러나고 있습니다.\n3. 잠재적 리스크 관리하기\n지속되는 갈등은 잠재적인 리스크예요. 미·중 갈등이 언제든 다시 격화될 수 있다는 점을 염두에 둘 필요가 있어요. 세계 1, 2위 국가의 충돌은 글로벌 증시에 큰 충격을 줄 수 있어요. 이는 트럼프의 임기가 끝나든, 집권 정당이 바뀌든 마찬가지입니다. 미·중 갈등을 사라지지 않을 ‘상수’로 받아들이는 것이 중요합니다.\n\n💡 다음 글 예고\n\n트럼프 2기 정부 출범과 함께 신설된 DOGE(정부효율부), 혹시 잊으셨나요?\n우리가 워싱턴에서 만난 기업 관계자들은 하나같이 DOGE(Department of Government Efficiency)의 영향력에 대해 이야기하고 있었어요. 다음 글에서는 DOGE 의 진짜 목적은 무엇이며 향후 미국 경제에는 어떤 영향을 미칠지, 기업과 언론, 정치권의 평가는 어떤지, 결국 투자자가 알아야 할 것들은 무엇일지에 대해 말씀드리겠습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter 한상원 애널리스트 Edit 기명균 윤동해 Graphic 고영진 윤자영",
