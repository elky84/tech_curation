        "content:encodedSnippet": "With the launch of Visual Studio 2026, we announced a Private Preview of GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++, which reduces the cost of adopting the latest version of the MSVC Build Tools. We used the feedback we received from our many Private Preview participants to make improvements that benefit all our users. After receiving feedback, we added support for CMake projects, reduced hallucinations, removed several critical failures, improved Copilot’s behavior when encountering an internal compiler error, and reinforced Copilot’s understanding of when project files need to be modified to do the upgrade.\nHere’s what one of our Private Preview participants said about their experience:\n“Having Copilot guide the upgrade flow and surface suggested changes in context has made that process smoother than doing it entirely by hand or by another agent.” – Private Preview participant\n\nWe are happy to announce that this feature is now available to all C++ users as a Public Preview in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nTo get started, check out the documentation on Microsoft Learn.\nWhat to expect\nAfter launching GitHub Copilot app modernization, Copilot will examine your project to see if there are any steps to take to update your project settings to move to the newer MSVC version. If so, it’ll assist you in making those changes.\nAssessment\nAfter the settings have been updated, Copilot will do an initial build to assess if there are any issues blocking your upgrade, such as stricter conformance, warnings whose warning level has changed, or non-standard extensions that have been deprecated or removed. After the assessment is complete, Copilot checks with you to confirm accuracy, and gives you a chance to give it further instructions like ignoring specific or entire categories of issues.\n\nPlanning\nAfter you and Copilot agree on the assessment, it will move into the planning stage, where Copilot will propose solutions to all the issues that need to be addressed. Again, it will produce a detailed description of these solutions and its reasoning for applying them, and it will check with you for any additional information. If you don’t like the proposed solution, you can direct it down another path.\n\nExecution\nOnce the plan is set, Copilot will break the plan down into concrete tasks for execution. You can direct it to approach the implementation in ways that fit your organization’s processes, such as by keeping similar changes in the same commit or using a particular style guideline when editing the code. Copilot will execute the tasks and initiate another build to check that all issues are resolved. If they aren’t, it will iterate until it has resolved the issues for you.\n\nYou are in control\nAt every step of the way, you can shape Copilot’s behavior, guiding it towards solutions that fit your own expectations, saving you time researching, diagnosing issues, designing solutions, and implementing those solutions. It can take a multi-person, multi-week task of upgrading your build tools and turn it into something you do on the same day as the release of the new tools.\nTalk to us!\nWe are excited for you to try out this feature. Get started by installing the latest build of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Let us know how well this feature is working for you and how we can make it even better. If you have any questions or general comments about the feature, feel free to leave a comment on this blog post. If you want to suggest an improvement, you can use the Help > Send Feedback menu directly in Visual Studio to post on Developer Community.\nThe post GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is now in Public Preview appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

This update brings a host of new additions, including project outline updates for filtering and bookmarking CMake targets in large CMake projects and expanded CTest support to customize this output. To view the full list of updates with this release, please look at our CHANGELOG.\nThis release features the following contributions from our open-source community. Thank you for your continued support!\nAdd bookmarks and filtering of outline view by @bradphelan\nAdd pre-fill project name using current folder name by @ho-cooh\nAdd API v5 which adds presets api by @OrkunTokdemir\nAdd output parser for include-what-you-use by @malsyned\nIn test explorer, associated CTest tests with outermost function or macro invocation that calls add_test() instead of with the add_test() call itself by @malsyned\nBetter support of cmake v4.1 and its error index files in cmake-file-api replies by @STMicroelectronics\nFix bug in which clicking “Run Test” for filtered tests executed all tests instead by @hippo91\nFix auto-focusing the “Search” input field in the CMake cache view by @simhof-basyskom\nProject Outline view updates: Filter and bookmark your CMake Targets\nNavigating through large CMake projects with many nested targets can sometimes be difficult. The Project Outline view has been updated to have filtering and bookmarking support, making it easier to manage your CMake targets.\nFilter through complex target outlines\nYou can now filter the Project Outline view to quickly locate specific targets in large projects. This is especially useful when working with projects that generate dozens of targets across multiple subdirectories.\n\nFor example, you might filter targets by a feature area or naming convention.\n\nBookmark commonly used CMake targets\nCMake Tools now supports bookmarking commonly used targets so they appear in a dedicated Bookmarks section in the CMake sidebar. This provides quick access to targets you build, debug, or run most often, without having to repeatedly search through the full project hierarchy.\nTo bookmark a target, navigate to the desired target in the Project Outline view and select Toggle Bookmark.\n\nThis will add the selected target to the separate Bookmarks section in the CMake sidebar. From here, commonly used targets can be built, debugged, or ran in the terminal.\nImproved CTest failure output.\nThis release also improves the CTest experience by adding support for configurable failure patterns. With the new Failure Patterns setting, you can tell CMake Tools how to interpret test output so failures surface more useful and structured information.\n\nThis is particularly helpful for test frameworks where important failure details, such as diffs or assertion outputs, are embedded in test logs. Instead of manually digging through raw output, you can define patterns that extract and highlight the relevant information directly after a test fails.\nFor example, you can define how CHECK_EQUAL shows diffing straight to the user.\nThis allows the user to have a transparent view of their test failures and quickly debug any test output.\n\nWhat do you think?\nDownload Visual Studio Code and our C++ extensions (CMake Tools and C/C++) and let us know what you think. We would love to see what you contribute to our repo.

        "pubDate": "Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:00:09 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "WhatsApp has adopted and rolled out a new layer of security for users – built with Rust – as part of its effort to harden defenses against malware threats.\nWhatsApp’s experience creating and distributing our media consistency library in Rust to billions of devices and browsers proves Rust is production ready at a global scale.\nOur Media Handling Strategy\nWhatsApp provides default end-to-end encryption for over 3 billion people to message securely each and every day. Online security is an adversarial space, and to continue ensuring users can keep messaging securely, we’re constantly adapting and evolving our strategy against cyber-security threats – all while supporting the WhatsApp infrastructure to help people connect. \nFor example, WhatsApp, like many other applications, allows users to share media and other types of documents. WhatsApp helps protect users by warning about dangerous attachments like APKs, yet rare and sophisticated malware could be hidden within a seemingly benign file like an image or video. These maliciously crafted files might target unpatched vulnerabilities in the operating system, libraries distributed by the operating system, or the application itself.\nTo help protect against such potential threads, WhatsApp is increasingly using the Rust programming language, including in our media sharing functionality. Rust is a memory safe language offering numerous security benefits. We believe that this is the largest rollout globally of any library written in Rust.\nTo help explain why and how we rolled this out, we should first look back at a key OS-level vulnerability that sent an important signal to WhatsApp around hardening media-sharing defenses.\n2015 Android Vulnerability: A Wake-up Call for Media File Protections\nIn 2015, Android devices, and the applications that ran on them, became vulnerable to the “Stagefright” vulnerability. The bug lay in the processing of media files by operating system-provided libraries, so WhatsApp and other applications could not patch the underlying vulnerability. Because it could often take months for people to update to the latest version of their software, we set out to find solutions that would keep WhatsApp users safe, even in the event of an operating system vulnerability. \nAt that time, we realized that a cross-platform C++ library already developed by WhatsApp to send and consistently format MP4 files (called “wamedia”) could be modified to detect files which do not adhere to the MP4 standard and might trigger bugs in a vulnerable OS library on the receiver side – hence putting a target’s security at risk. We rolled out this check and were able to protect WhatsApp users from the Stagefright vulnerability much more rapidly than by depending on users to update the OS itself.\nBut because media checks run automatically on download and process untrusted inputs, we identified early on that wamedia was a prime candidate for using a memory safe language. \n\nOur Solution: Rust at Scale\nRather than an incremental rewrite, we developed the Rust version of wamedia in parallel with the original C++ version. We used differential fuzzing and extensive integration and unit tests to ensure compatibility between the two implementations.\nTwo major hurdles were the initial binary size increase due to bringing in the Rust standard library and the build system support required for the diverse platforms supported by WhatsApp. WhatsApp made a long-term bet to build that support. In the end, we replaced 160,000 lines of C++ (excluding tests) with 90,000 lines of Rust (including tests). The Rust version showed performance and runtime memory usage advantages over the C++. Given this success, Rust was fully rolled out to all WhatsApp users and many platforms: Android, iOS, Mac, Web, Wearables, and more. With this positive evidence in hand, memory safe languages will play an ever increasing part in WhatsApp’s overall approach to application and user security.\nOver time, we’ve added more checks for non-conformant structures within certain file types to help protect downstream libraries from parser differential exploit attempts. Additionally, we check higher risk file types, even if structurally conformant, for risk indicators. For instance, PDFs are often a vehicle for malware, and more specifically, the presence of embedded files and scripting elements within a PDF further raise risks. We also detect when one file type masquerades as another, through a spoofed extension or MIME type. Finally, we uniformly flag known dangerous file types, such as executables or applications, for special handling in the application UX. Altogether, we call this ensemble of checks “Kaleidoscope.” This system protects people on WhatsApp from potentially malicious unofficial clients and attachments. Although format checks will not stop every attack, this layer of defense helps mitigate many of them.\nEach month, these libraries are distributed to billions of phones, laptops, desktops, watches, and browsers running on multiple operating systems for people on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram. This is the largest ever deployment of Rust code to a diverse set of end-user platforms and products that we are aware of. Our experience speaks to the production-readiness and unique value proposition of Rust on the client-side.\nHow Rust Fits In To WhatsApp’s Approach to App Security\nThis is just one example of WhatsApp’s many investments in security. It’s why we built default end-to-end encryption for personal messages and calls, offer end-to-end encrypted backups, and use key transparency technology to verify a secure connection, provide additional calling protections, and more.\nWhatsApp has a strong track record of being loud when we find issues and working to hold bad actors accountable. For example, WhatsApp reports CVEs for important issues we find in our applications, even if we do not find evidence of exploitation. We do this to give people on WhatsApp the best chance of protecting themselves by seeing a security advisory and updating quickly.\nTo ensure application security, we first must identify and quantify the sources of risk. We do this through internal and external audits like NCC Group’s public assessment of WhatsApp’s end-to-end encrypted backups, fuzzing, static analysis, supply chain management, and automated attack surface analysis. We also recently expanded our Bug Bounty program to introduce the WhatsApp Research Proxy – a tool that makes research into WhatsApp’s network protocol more effective.\nNext, we reduce the identified risk. Like many others in the industry, we found that the majority of the high severity vulnerabilities we published were due to memory safety issues in code written in the C and C++ programming languages. To combat this we invest in three parallel strategies:\nDesign the product to minimize unnecessary attack surface exposure.\nInvest in security assurance for the remaining C and C++ code.\nDefault the choice of memory safe languages, and not C and C++, for new code.\nWhatsApp has added protections like CFI, hardened memory allocators, safer buffer handling APIs, and more. C and C++ developers have specialized security training, development guidelines, and automated security analysis on their changes. We also have strict SLAs for fixing issues uncovered by the risk identification process.\nAccelerating Rust Adoption to Enhance Security\nRust enabled WhatsApp’s security team to develop a secure, high performance, cross-platform library to ensure media shared on the platform is consistent and safe across devices. This is an important step forward in adding additional security behind the scenes for users and part of our ongoing defense-in-depth approach. Security teams at WhatsApp and Meta are highlighting opportunities for high impact adoption of Rust to interested teams, and we anticipate accelerating adoption of Rust over the coming years. \nThe post Rust at Scale: An Added Layer of Security for WhatsApp appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The AI Evolution of Graph Search at Netflix: From Structured Queries to Natural Language\nBy Alex Hutter and Bartosz Balukiewicz\nOur previous blog posts (part 1, part 2, part 3) detailed how Netflix’s Graph Search platform addresses the challenges of searching across federated data sets within Netflix’s enterprise ecosystem. Although highly scalable and easy to configure, it still relies on a structured query language for input. Natural language based search has been possible for some time, but the level of effort required was high. The emergence of readily-available AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), has created new opportunities to integrate AI search features, with a smaller investment and improved accuracy.\nWhile Text-to-Query and Text-to-SQL are established problems, the complexity of distributed Graph Search data in the GraphQL ecosystem necessitates innovative solutions. This is the first in a three-part series where we will detail our journey: how we implemented these solutions, evaluated their performance, and ultimately evolved them into a self-managed platform.\nThe Need for Intuitive Search: Addressing Business and Product Demands\nNatural language search is the ability to use everyday language to retrieve information as opposed to complex, structured query languages like the Graph Search Filter Domain Specific Language (DSL). When users interact with 100’s of various UIs within the suite of Content and Business Products applications, a frequent task is filtering a data table like the one below:\nExample Content and Business Products application view\nIdeally, a user simply wants to satisfy a query like “I want to see all movies from the 90s about robots from the US.” Because the underlying platform operates on the Graph Search Filter DSL, the application acts as an intermediary. Users input their requirements through UI elements — toggling facets or using query builders — and the system programmatically converts these interactions into a valid DSL query to filter the data.\nThe Complexity of filtering and DSL generation\nThis process presents a few issues.\nToday, many applications have bespoke components for collecting user input — the experience varies across them and they have inconsistent support for the DSL. Users need to “learn” how to use each application to achieve their goals.\nAdditionally, some domains have hundreds of fields in an index that could be faceted or filtered by. A subject matter expert (SME) may know exactly what they want to accomplish, but be bottlenecked by the inefficient pace of filling out a large scale UI form and translating their questions in order to encode it in a representation Graph Search needs.\nMost importantly, users think and operate using natural language, not technical constructs like query builders, components, or DSLs. By requiring them to switch contexts, we introduce friction that slows them down or even prevents their progress.\nWith readily-available AI components, our users can now interact with our systems through natural language. The challenge now is to make sure our offering, searching Netflix’s complex enterprise state with natural language, is an intuitive and trustworthy experience.\nNatural language queries translated into Graph Search Filter DSL\nWe’ve made a decision to pursue generating Graph Search Filter statements from natural language to meet this need. Our intention is to augment and not replace existing applications with retrieval augmented generation (RAG), providing tooling and capabilities so that applications in our ecosystem have newly accessible means of processing and presenting their data in their distinct domain flavours. It should be noted that all the work here has direct application to building a RAG system on top of Graph Search in the future.\nUnder the Hood: Our Approach to Text-to-Query\nThe core function of the text-to-query process is converting a user’s (often ambiguous) natural language question into a structured query. We primarily achieve this through the use of an LLM.\nBefore we dive deeper, let’s quickly revisit the structure of Graph Search Filter DSL. Each Graph Search index is defined by a GraphQL query, made up of a collection of fields. Each field has a type e.g. boolean, string, and some have their permitted values governed by controlled vocabularies — a standardized and governed list of values (like an enumeration, or a foreign key). The names of those fields can be used to construct expressions using comparison (e.g. > or ==) or inclusion/exclusion operators (e.g. IN). In turn those expressions can be combined using logical operators (e.g. AND) to construct complex statements.\nGraph Search Filter DSL\nWith that understanding, we can now more rigorously define the conversion process. We need the LLM to generate a Graph Search Filter DSL statement that is syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct.\nSyntactic correctness is easy — does it parse? To be syntactically correct, the generated statement must be well formed i.e. follow the grammar of the Graph Search Filter DSL.\nSemantic correctness adds some additional complexity as it requires more knowledge of the index itself. To be semantically correct:\n\nit must respect the field types i.e. only use comparisons that make sense given the underlying type;\nit must only use fields that are actually present in the index, i.e. does not hallucinate;\nwhen the values of a field are constrained to a controlled vocabulary, any comparison must only use values from that controlled vocabulary.\n\nPragmatic correctness is much more difficult. It asks the question: does the generated filter actually capture the intent of the user’s query?\nThe following sections will detail how we pre-process the user’s question to create appropriate context for the instructions that we will provide to the LLM — both of which are fundamental to LLM interaction — as well as post-processing we perform on the generated statement to validate it, and help users understand and trust the results they receive.\nAt a high level that process looks like this:\nGraph Search FIlter DSL generation process\nContext Engineering\nPreparation for the filter generation task is predominantly engineering the appropriate context. The LLM will need access to the fields of an index and their metadata in order to construct semantically correct filters. As the indices are defined by GraphQL queries, we can use the type information from the GraphQL schema to derive much of the required information. For some fields, there is additional information we can provide beyond what’s available in the schema as well, in particular permissible values that pull from controlled vocabularies.\nEach field in the index is associated with metadata as seen below, and that metadata is provided as part of the context.\nGraph Search index representation\nThe field is derived from the document path as characterized by the GraphQL query.\nThe description is the comment from the GraphQL schema for the field.\nThe type is derived from the GraphQL schema for the field e.g. Boolean, String, enum. We also support an additional controlled vocabulary type we will discuss more of shortly.\nThe valid values are derived from enum values for the enum type or from a controlled vocabulary as we will now discuss.\n\nA controlled vocabulary is a specific field type that consists of a finite set of allowed values, which are defined by a SMEs or domain owners. Index fields can be associated with a particular controlled vocabulary, e.g. countries with members such as Spain and Thailand, and any usage of that field within a generated statement must refer to values from that vocabulary.\nNaively providing all the metadata as context to the LLM worked for simple cases but did not scale. Some indices have hundreds of fields and some controlled vocabularies have thousands of valid values. Providing all of those, especially the controlled vocabulary values and their accompanying metadata, expands the context; this proportionally increases latency and decreases the correctness of generated filter statements. Not providing the values wasn’t an option as we needed to ground the LLMs generated statements- without them, the LLM would frequently hallucinate values that did not exist.\nCurating the context to an appropriate subset was a problem we addressed using the well known RAG pattern.\nField RAG\nAs mentioned previously, some indices have hundreds of fields, however, most user’s questions typically refer only to a handful of them. If there was no cost in including them all, we would, but as mentioned prior, there is a cost in terms of the latency of query generation as well as the correctness of the generated query (e.g. needle-in-the-hackstack problem) and non-deterministic results.\nTo determine which subset of fields to include in the context, we “match” them against the intent of the user’s question.\n\nEmbeddings are created for index fields and their metadata (name, description, type) and are indexed in a vector store\nAt filter generation time, the user’s question is chunked with an overlapping strategy. For each chunk, we perform a vector search to identify the top K most relevant values and the fields to which they belong.\nDeduplication: The top K fields from each chunk are both consolidated and deduplicated before being provided as context to the system instructions.\nField RAG process (chunking, merge, deduplicate)\nControlled Vocabularies RAG\nIndex fields of the controlled vocabulary type are associated with a particular controlled vocabulary, again, countries are one example. Given a user’s question, we can infer whether or not it refers to values of a particular controlled vocabulary. In turn, by knowing which controlled vocabulary values are present, we can identify additional, related index fields that should be included in the context that may not have been identified by the field RAG step.\nEach controlled vocabulary value has:\n\na unique identifier within its type;\na human readable display name;\na description of the value;\nalso-known-as values or AKA display names, e.g. “romcom” for “Romantic Comedy”.\n\nTo determine which subset of values to include in the context for controlled vocabulary fields (and also possibly infer additional fields), we “match” them against the user’s question.\n\nEmbeddings are created for controlled vocabulary values and their metadata, and these are indexed in a vector store. The controlled vocabularies are available via GraphQL and are regularly fetched and reindexed so this system stays up to date with any changes in the domain.\nAt filter generation time, the user’s question is chunked. For each chunk, we perform a vector search to identify the top K most relevant values (but only for the controlled vocabularies that are associated with fields in the index)\nThe top K values from each chunk are deduplicated by their controlled vocabulary type. The associated field definition is then injected into the context along with the matched values.\nControlled Vocabularies RAG\nCombining both approaches, the RAG of fields and controlled vocabularies, we end up with the solution that each input question resolves in available and matched fields and values:\nField and CV RAG\nThe quality of results generated by the RAG tool can be significantly enhanced by tuning its various parameters, or “levers.” These include strategies for reranking, chunking, and the selection of different embedding generation models. The careful and systematic evaluation of these factors will be the focus of the subsequent parts of this series.\nThe Instructions\nOnce the context is constructed, it is provided to the LLM with a set of instructions and the user’s question. The instructions can be summarised as follows: “Given a natural language question, generate a syntactically, semantically, and pragmatically correct filter statement given the availability of the following index fields and their metadata.”\n\nIn order to generate a syntactically correct filter statement, the instructions include the syntax rules of the DSL.\nIn order to generate a semantically correct filter statement, the instructions tell the LLM to ground the generated statement in the provided context.\nIn order to generate a pragmatically correct filter statement, so far we focus on better context engineering to ensure that only the most relevant fields and values are provided. We haven’t identified any instructions that make the LLM just “do better” at this aspect of the task.\nGraph Search Filter DSL generation\nAfter the filter statement is generated by the LLM, we deterministically validate it prior to returning the values to the user.\nValidation\nSyntactic Correctness\nSyntactic correctness ensures the LLM output is a parsable filter statement. We utilize an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) parser built for our custom DSL. If the generated string fails to parse into a valid AST, we know immediately that the query is malformed and there is a fundamental issue with the generation.\nThe other approach to solve this problem could be using the structured outputs modes provided by some LLMs. However, our initial evaluation yielded mixed results, as the custom DSL is not natively supported and requires further work.\nSemantic Correctness\nDespite careful context engineering using the RAG pattern, the LLM sometimes hallucinates both fields and available values in the generated filter statement. The most straightforward way of preventing this phenomenon is validating the generated filters against available index metadata. This approach does not impact the overall latency of the system, as we are already working with an AST of the filter statement, and the metadata is freely available from the context engineering stage.\nDSL verification & hallucinations\nIf a hallucination is detected it can be returned as an error to a user, indicating the need to refine the query, or can be provided back to the LLM in the form of a feedback loop for self correction.\nThis increases the filter generation time, so should be used cautiously with a limited number of retries.\nBuilding Confidence\nYou probably noticed we are not validating the generated filter for pragmatic correctness. That task is the hardest challenge: The filter parses (syntactic) and uses real fields (semantic), but is it what the user meant? When a user searches for “Dark”, do they mean the specific German sci-fi series Dark, or are they browsing for the mood category “dark TV shows”?\nThe gap between what a user intended and the generated filter statement is often caused by ambiguity. Ambiguity stems from the compression of natural language. A user says “German time-travel mystery with the missing boy and the cave” but the index contains discrete metadata fields like releaseYear, genreTags, and synopsisKeywords.\nHow do we ensure users aren’t inadvertently led to wrong answers or to answers for questions they didn’t ask?\nShowing Our Work\nOne way we are handling ambiguity is by showing our work. We visualise the generated filters in the UI in a user-friendly way allowing them to very clearly see if the answer we’re returning is what they were looking for so they can trust the results..\nWe cannot show a raw DSL string (e.g., origin.country == ‘Germany’ AND genre.tags CONTAINS ‘Time Travel’ AND synopsisKeywords LIKE ‘*cave*’) to a non-technical user. Instead, we reflect its underlying AST into UI components.\nAfter the LLM generates a filter statement, we parse it into an AST, and then map that AST to the existing “Chips” and “Facets” in our UI (see below). If the LLM generates a filter for origin.country == ‘Germany’, the user sees the “Country” dropdown pre-selected to “Germany.” This gives users immediate visual feedback and the ability to easily fine-tune the query using standard UI controls when the results need improvement or further experimentation.\nGenerated filters visualisation\nExplicit Entity Selection\nAnother strategy we’ve developed to remove ambiguity happens at query time. We give users the ability to constrain their input to refer to known entities using “@mentions”. Similar to Slack, typing @ lets them search for entities directly from our specialized UI Graph Search component, giving them easy access to multiple controlled vocabularies (plus other identifying metadata like launch year) to feel confident they’re choosing the entity they intend.\nIf a user types, “When was @dark produced”, we explicitly know they are referring to the Series controlled vocabulary, allowing us to bypass the RAG inference step and hard-code that context, significantly increasing pragmatic correctness (and building user trust in the process).\nExample @mentions usage in the UI\nEnd-to-end architecture\nAs mentioned previously, the solution architecture is divided into pre-processing, filter statement generation, and then post-processing stages. The pre-processing handles context building and involves a RAG pattern for similarity search, while the post-processing validation stage checks the correctness of the LLM-generated filter statements and provides visibility into the results for end users. This design strategically balances LLM involvement with more deterministic strategies.\nEnd-to-end architecture\nThe end-to-end process is as follows:\n\nA user’s natural language question (with optional `@mentions` statements) are provided as input, along with the Graph Search index context\nThe context is scoped by using the RAG pattern on both fields and possible values\nThe pre-processed context and the question are fed into the LLM with an instruction asking for a syntactically and semantically correct filter statement\nThe generated filer statement DSL is verified and checked for hallucinations\nThe final response contains the related AST in order to build “Chips” and “Facets”\n\nSummary\nBy combining our existing Graph Search infrastructure with the power and flexibility of LLMs, we’ve bridged the gap between complex filter statements and user intent. We moved from requiring users to speak our language (DSL) to our systems understanding theirs.\nThe initial challenge for our users was successfully addressed. However, our next steps involve transforming this system into a comprehensive and expandable platform, rigorously evaluating its performance in a live production environment, and expanding its capabilities to support GraphQL-first user interfaces. These topics, and others, will be the focus of the subsequent installments in this series. Be sure to follow along!\nYou may have noticed that we have a lot more to do on this project, including named entity recognition and extraction, intent detection so we can route questions to the appropriate indices, and query rewriting among others.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "When people think about tooling for Android development, the conversation often gravitates towards platform-specific concerns: UI performance, layout validation, device compatibility, or resource management. Yet for many Android teams, the most persistent challenges don’t sit at the platform level – they’re in the team’s Kotlin codebase itself.\nAs Android projects scale, Kotlin brings strong language features, but it doesn’t eliminate complexity. Null safety can still be misused, functions grow unchecked, architectural boundaries blur, and code style diverges across teams. This is where Qodana for Android becomes more relevant.\nQodana is not an Android framework tool, and it doesn’t aim to replace Android-specific tooling such as Android Lint. Instead, it focuses on Kotlin code quality, automation, and consistency, which are central concerns for modern Android development.\nIn the past, you might have seen Developer Advocate Anton Arhipov showing users how Qodana works with Kotlin to improve code quality for Android developers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQodana has advanced significantly since then, and the needs of Android developers have grown, too. \nKotlin as the common denominator in Android teams\nAt JetBrains, we’re proud of having created Kotlin. While Kotlin is a powerful, multi-purpose language used for backend development and for building cross-platform applications across mobile, desktop, and web, it’s also widely recognized as the primary language for Android development. That’s why bringing strong code quality tooling like Qodana to Android teams is so important.\nWithin these teams, Kotlin is also used beyond the mobile app itself. Shared libraries, test infrastructure, build tooling, and even backend services are increasingly written in the language.\nThis creates a need for consistent Kotlin standards across different parts of an organization. In practice, however, consistency is difficult to maintain. Local IDE inspections vary, CI checks are often incomplete, and code review standards depend heavily on individual reviewers.\nQodana for Android addresses this gap by allowing Android teams to enforce Kotlin inspections automatically and consistently in CI systems, using the same inspection engine that developers already rely on in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA. This alignment is critical. When local feedback and automated checks disagree, developers lose trust in both.\nCreating a CI-first quality gate with code analysis\nMost issues that slow Android teams down are not catastrophic runtime failures. They are incremental quality regressions: overly complex methods, fragile null handling, unused code, or visibility issues that make refactoring harder over time.\nQodana runs Kotlin static analysis as part of the software development lifecycle, shifting quality checks earlier and making them repeatable. Rather than relying on manual code reviews to catch everything, teams can use Qodana as a quality gate that highlights high-impact issues before code is merged.\nThis is particularly valuable for Android projects with multiple modules, long-lived feature branches, or distributed teams. Automated analysis ensures that quality expectations don’t change depending on who reviews the pull request.\nWhat Qodana for Android is, and what it’s not\nIt is important to be precise about what Qodana does in an Android context.\nWhat Qodana for Android does:\nAnalyze Kotlin code used in Android projects\nAutomate Kotlin quality checks in CI\nAlign IDE inspections with automated enforcement\nSupport scalable quality management across teams\nAnalyze project layouts and resources\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat Qodana for Android does not do:\nReplace Android Lint\nAnalyze device-specific behavior\nProvide Android framework diagnostics\nQodana can complement existing Android tooling rather than compete with it.\nAutomation and the reality of scale\nAs Android teams grow, review capacity does not scale linearly with team size. Kotlin helps reduce certain classes of errors, but it doesn’t replace the need for disciplined code structure and readability.\nQodana supports this reality through automation. By codifying Kotlin quality rules and running them consistently, teams can remove repetitive review comments and focus human attention on business logic and product decisions.\nThis is not about replacing developers’ judgment – it’s about reserving that judgment for where it adds the most value.\nKotlin quality beyond the Android boundary\nOne of the less obvious advantages of using Qodana in Android contexts is that it does not stop at the Android module boundary. Many Android teams share Kotlin code across mobile and non-mobile components, and maintaining consistent standards across those environments is often challenging.\nBecause Qodana operates at the language and project level, it allows teams to apply the same Kotlin inspections across shared libraries and supporting systems. This reduces fragmentation and helps organizations treat Kotlin as a strategic language rather than a platform-specific implementation detail.\nIn fact, the official Kotlin team even uses Qodana for internal quality and security. \n\n\n\n\nRead Case Study\nPractical quality check adoption for existing Android codebases\nOne of the biggest barriers to adopting stricter quality checks is existing technical debt. Many Android projects are years old, and introducing a new tool that flags thousands of issues is rarely productive.\nQodana is designed to support gradual adoption. Teams can baseline existing issues, focus on preventing new regressions, and incrementally tighten standards over time. This makes it viable for real-world Android projects rather than only greenfield applications.\nThe ability to configure inspections, tailor rulesets, and control enforcement levels is essential for long-term success.\nA Kotlin-centric view of Android development\nSeen through a Kotlin-first lens, Qodana for Android is less about the platform and more about discipline. It helps teams treat code quality as an automated, shared responsibility rather than a manual afterthought.\nFor Android teams working primarily in Kotlin, especially those operating at scale or across multiple domains, this focus is both practical and necessary. Quality issues compound quietly over time, and automation is one of the few reliable ways to keep them under control.\nIncrease quality and security with Qodana\nAndroid development today is as much about managing complexity as it is about building features. Kotlin provides powerful tools, but without consistent enforcement and automation, even well-intentioned teams drift.\nQodana for Android offers a way to bring Kotlin code quality into the foreground of the development process, embedding it into CI and aligning it with developers’ existing workflows. It is not an Android-specific analyzer, but for Kotlin-driven Android teams, that is precisely its strength.\nView Docs\nLet’s talk at KotlinConf 2026!\nJoin JetBrains for the most important Kotlin event of the year and find out how Qodana can help your team boost code quality – right from the source.

Our State of Game Development 2025 report reveals critical insights that provide a clearer picture of where the industry is heading.\nExplore the report\n                                                    \nLayoffs and job security concerns\nThe game development sector has experienced significant turbulence. More than half of industry professionals reported experiencing layoffs within their organizations. This figure is notably higher than in previous years. Job security has sharply declined, placing game developers among the least confident in the tech industry. Studios may need to revisit their organizational strategies, hiring practices, and retention policies to foster stability.\n\n\n\n\nEngine preferences: Unity still leads, but Godot is rising\nUnity remains dominant among indie and mid-sized studios due to its versatility and ease of use. Unreal Engine remains a strong competitor, especially for graphics-intensive projects. However, the most notable trend is the rapid growth of Godot, an open-source engine that has become increasingly popular among indie developers and hobbyists for its flexibility, openness, and community-driven nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform priorities: Mobile and desktop dominate\nIndie developers maintain their focus primarily on mobile and desktop platforms, with Android being the most targeted, closely followed by Windows and iOS. This aligns with the industry’s shift toward platforms that offer wider user bases and easier market entry points compared to traditional consoles.\n\n\n\n\nIDEs and developer tools: JetBrains Rider emerges as a favorite\nIn 2025, JetBrains Rider emerged as the top IDE for indie developers, surpassing both Visual Studio and VS Code. Rider’s robust feature set and seamless workflow integration have made it the preferred tool for daily coding.\n\n\n\n\nPractical AI adoption: From experimental to essential\nAI technology has moved beyond experimentation to become a standard part of game development workflows. Nearly half of developers regularly use AI for feature implementation, and many leverage it for streamlined code reviews. ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and JetBrains AI Assistant have become staples in developers’ toolkits, while Junie, JetBrains’ AI coding agent released in April 2025, is quickly gaining popularity. AAA studios show a strong interest in incorporating AI coding agents into their pipelines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the full report to dive deeper into these game-changing trends  and leverage our data to benchmark your studio’s strategies and decisions against current industry standards.\nExplore the report",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI coding agents are multiplying fast. Some of the most common ones include Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Auggie, OpenCode, and Copilot, and more are being released every day. Each comes with its own unique strengths, specific setups, and varying levels of editor support. Keeping track of what’s out there, let alone getting it running in your IDE, hasn’t been easy.\nWell, until now, that is.\nTogether with Zed (Zed’s announcement), we’ve launched the official ACP Agent Registry: a directory of AI coding agents, integrated directly into JetBrains IDEs and Zed. Browse what’s available, click Install, and start working right away. This beta release is just the beginning.\nWhat is the ACP (and why does it matter)?\nThe Agent Client Protocol is an open standard that lets any AI coding agent work in any supporting editor. Think of it like the Language Server Protocol, but for AI agents. The LSP lets any editor support any language through a shared standard. The ACP does the same for coding agents. You only need to implement it once, and then it will work in your JetBrains IDE, Zed, or any other editor that supports the protocol.\nThis means you get to pick your preferred agent and editor, and they will then work together seamlessly – no vendor lock-in and no waiting for someone to build a specific integration.\nACP has been, since we started integrating it to Mistral Vibe, a real joy to use: thoughtfully designed from the ground up, community-driven, and evolving rapidly. We’ve found it not only simplifies integration, but also fits our focus on open and flexible tools. It’s really great to see a standard that puts developer choice first.\nMichel Thomazo, Software Engineer @ Mistral AI\nWhat the registry adds\nThe ACP made agent interoperability technically possible. The registry makes it convenient.\nInstead of manually configuring agents, you can now:\nDiscover agents that fit your workflow \nInstall with a single click, no config files required\nSwitch between agents based on the task at hand\nStay current as agents release new versions\nWhat’s in the registry?\nAt launch, you’ll find a wide array of different agents:\nAgent\nDescription\nAuggie CLI\nFull-featured coding assistant optimized for large-scale refactors\nFactory Droid\nSpecialized agent for automated code generation workflows\nGemini CLI\nGoogle’s agent with deep codebase understanding and multimodal capabilities\nGitHub Copilot\nGitHub’s AI pair programmer, now available via the ACP\nMistral Vibe\nLightweight, fast agent built on Mistral’s models\nOpenCode\nCommunity-driven, fully open-source agent\nQwen Code\nAlibaba’s coding agent with strong multilingual support\nInnovation in software agents is moving at an unbelievable pace. The Agent Registry and ACP makes it simple for developers to use the best agents in their favorite tools. \nChris Kelly, Product @ Augment Code\n\nWhy would you want multiple agents?\nIn general, it’s less about having multiple agents than about enabling you to pick and choose the ones that work well in your workflow. Different agents come with different benefits. Some provide a more attractive pricing structure for your business, some provide a user experience that you simply enjoy more than others’, and some embody the ideas of open-source development that just resonate with you.\nThe Agent Client Protocol registry lets you experiment freely. Try a few, see what clicks for your workflow, and then keep the ones that help. You’re not locked into a single vendor’s vision of what AI-assisted development should look like.\nWe’re excited to support the ACP Agent Registry as a step toward a more open agent ecosystem where Droids can integrate seamlessly across all IDEs.\nFrancesca LaBianca, VP of Operations @ Factory\n\nHow to use it\nIn any JetBrains IDE (2025.3.2+) with JetBrains AI (253.30387.147):\nOpen Settings | Tools | AI Assistant | Agents or select  “Install From ACP Registry…” in the agent picker menu\n\nFind an agent that interests you\nClick Install\nThat’s it. The agent is configured and ready to use in the AI Chat tool window.Quick note: agents typically come with their own subscription. That’s between you and them. You won’t need a JetBrains AI subscription to use ACP agents.\nWant to try something concrete? Install OpenCode, open a project, and ask it to explain an unfamiliar module. OpenCode also lets you swap between different LLMs, so you can experiment with what works best for you. \nIf you prefer manual configuration, that option is still there, too. Just edit the acp.json directly. This is useful for agents that aren’t in the registry yet or for custom setups.\nWhat this means\nFor developers: More choice and zero lock-in. Use any agent you want in the IDE you love. \nFor agent builders: Instant distribution to millions of JetBrains and Zed users. Implement the ACP once and reach everyone.\nFor the ecosystem: Competition on quality, not on who controls the integration. The best agents win because they’re the best, not because they have exclusive deals.\nWe’re building this openly with Zed because we believe AI-assisted development shouldn’t be locked inside any single vendor’s ecosystem. Developers deserve to pick their tools freely.\nThe registry is one more step toward that future.\nFor agent builders: Get listed\nIf you’re building an ACP-compatible agent, the registry is now the fastest way to reach developers across JetBrains IDEs and Zed.\nTo list your agent:\nHead to the ACP Registry repository and check out the CONTRIBUTING.md for the full submission process and metadata requirements. Please note that, for now, we are only featuring agents that support Agent Auth or Terminal Auth. Full details of requirements and conditions can be found here. \nThis is an open registry. If you’re building an ACP-compatible agent, you’re welcome to submit it. The registry exists to serve the ecosystem, not to gatekeep it\nTry it today\nThe ACP Registry is available now in JetBrains IDE versions 2025.3 and later. Update your IDE and the JetBrains AI plugin, open Settings, and start exploring.\nHave feedback? Found a bug? The registry repo is open for issues and PRs. And if you’re building something interesting with ACP, we’d love to hear about it!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Jakkie Koekemoer & Shweta, draft.dev.\nTraditional wisdom in the dev world is that once you opt for proprietary APIs or vendor-specific tooling, migrating to alternative platforms is costly or impractical to adopt in the future.\nThat’s why engineering teams have considered vendor lock-in a trap. You end up paying more, limiting technical flexibility, losing bargaining power, and cramming your processes into someone else’s roadmap. And if you still want control and flexibility, you need to be on your toes with proactive planning, regular exports, and negotiating strict contractual exit terms.\nBut this binary thinking of lock-in vs. freedom is misleading.\nWhenever you spend significant time investing in any technology or architecture, you’re locked in. It might not seem like it on paper, but your reliance on that system grows the more you use it. Switching to something else requires a significant amount of work, even if there aren’t any other costs involved.\nInstead of trying to escape the unavoidable, consider to what extent any tool or technology meets your needs without enforcing limitations that hold you back.\nIn the context of CI/CD, that means a tool that accelerates delivery without sacrificing control.\nYour dependencies in CI/CD run across integrations, pricing tiers, hosted vs. self-hosted trade-offs, supported SLAs, and ecosystem workflows. A CI/CD vendor that provides open APIs, clear export paths, predictable pricing, and collaborative roadmapping has the potential to become a strategic partner.\nThis guide highlights the potential technical, financial, operational, and strategic risks CI/CD solutions can pose for your organization. Based on this framework, we’ll walk you through a practical questionnaire for evaluating potential solutions against your organization’s needs.\nUnderstanding your organization’s risk profile\nAny CI/CD platform can present you with a list of features, and that’s enough if you only want to choose a product.\nHowever, if you want to make a long-term commitment, you need to stop asking “What features does this solution have?” and instead ask “What risks does this vendor introduce?” By considering risks, you can assess whether a vendor will be a good strategic partner for you in the long term.\nLet’s look at the most important risks a CI/CD platform can introduce for an organization.\nTechnical risks\nThe foundation of any CI/CD platform is its portability. Consider whether the platform locks you into proprietary languages or relies on custom plugins for critical integrations.\nMore importantly, can pipelines, configurations, build artifacts, and logs be exported in a reusable format? If not, you run the risk of significant rework whenever there’s a need to reproduce builds in a different environment, be it a new data center, cloud region, or entirely different infrastructure provider.\nReproducing the same build reliability elsewhere requires substantial rewrites or custom tooling, potentially turning what should be a straightforward migration into a months-long engineering effort.\nFinancial risks\nHidden costs can accumulate quickly if you’re not careful. Consider data-transfer fees that you pay every time your team downloads a large build artifact, storage overages, and unpredictable API pricing when you’re building the financial case for adoption.\nAlso consider what happens when it’s time to leave. Do contracts lock in long-term minimums? Are there punitive exit clauses? A single large migration with consulting fees, rework, and downtime costs can make switching prohibitively expensive.\nOperational risks\nDay-to-day dependence on a vendor creates hidden fragility. If SLAs are slow, outages linger, or documentation falls out of sync with the product, you become increasingly reliant on vendor support just to keep critical systems running.\nOver time, you may end up locking into a specific UX and workflow, making it painful to change platforms even when better alternatives emerge.\nStrategic risks\nA platform that serves your current needs may not support your future growth, so consider alignment. Does the vendor’s product vision match your evolving direction? If the vendor deprioritizes features you rely on, undergoes a strategic shift in pricing or focus, or is acquired by a competitor with different priorities, will you be forced to compromise your own product goals?\nWithout formal channels to influence the vendor’s roadmap, you’re betting that the vendor’s interests will remain aligned with yours, which is a risky assumption over a multiyear relationship.\nEvaluating CI/CD platforms\nThe ideal CI/CD solution reduces risk, accelerates delivery, and empowers you to evolve your pipelines and processes. Which vendor or solution meets these requirements will depend on your organizational requirements and risk factors.\nThe following questionnaire can help you with your evaluation.\nUse the questions and suggested importance (Must, Should, or Nice) as a starting point, but feel free to adapt the questions and importance based on your organization’s needs.\nComplete the questionnaire for each platform or vendor you’re assessing, and rate questions from 0–2:\n0 = not available/unacceptable gap (indicates a real blocker)\n1 = partial/mitigatable (the capability exists but has limits or caveats)\n2 = fully available/meets requirements (the vendor delivers the capability as needed)\n\nThe question and the risk it mitigatesTypeVendor A (0–2)Vendor B (0–2)\nCan you export all configs, artifacts, and logs in usable, open formats?Red flag: Proprietary formats hold your operational data hostage.Must\nAre core APIs open, versioned, and comprehensively documented?Red flag: Private APIs prevent you from building essential custom automations.Must\nIs core functionality built-in or reliant on a third-party plugin ecosystem?Red flag: A plugin-first model creates architectural fragility and a massive, unmanaged security risk.Must\nDoes the vendor offer a self-hosted or portable runner option?Red flag: A single hosting model can lock you into an infrastructure that doesn’t meet your security or cost needs.Must\nIs pricing published, transparent, and predictable as you scale?Red flag: Opaque, usage-based pricing makes budgeting impossible and exposes you to surprise costs.Must\nDoes the contract include a clear support SLA and fair termination terms?Red flag: Without a guaranteed SLA, you have no support in a crisis. Punitive exit clauses are a major lock-in tactic.Must\nDoes the platform provide an intuitive UI that empowers the entire team, not just experts?Red flag: A clunky, expert-only UI creates a “guru” bottleneck and dramatically increases onboarding costs.Should\nCan you easily extract the raw data needed to track performance metrics (like DORA) in your own tools?Red flag: A “data black box” platform prevents you from measuring what matters and achieving data-driven improvement.Should\nIs there an active and transparent customer feedback channel that influences the roadmap?Red flag: A closed roadmap signals that the vendor’s priorities, not yours, will drive the product’s future.Should\nDoes the vendor have a clear and credible vision for incorporating AI-driven capabilities?Red flag: No AI vision signals strategic stagnation. You’re buying into a platform that is already behind the innovation curve.Nice\nDoes the platform have built-in, first-class features for performance (e.g. test parallelization)?Red flag: Lacking built-in performance features means you will spend engineering time building workarounds.Nice\n\n\n\n\n\nScore yourself as follows:\nAdd each vendor’s Must scores (max 11). Multiply the sum by 2 (to factor in its criticality).\nAdd the raw sums for Should (max 8) and Nice (max 6).\nTotal score = (Must sum × 2) + Should sum + Nice sum.\nMax possible = 36. Convert to a percentage if you want.\nInterpret the results as follows:\n>60 percent: Strong candidate (confirm that there are no instances where Must = 0)\n30–60 percent: Proceed with caution\n<30 percent: High risk, don’t commit\nIf any Must row is scored 0 for a vendor, it should be treated as a major deal-breaker, and you ought to remove the vendor from the shortlist. If you’re considering any option that scores poorly on export, automation, or billing transparency, running a short portability proof of concept (POC) is recommended.\nIf you’ve identified any red flags, categorize them to decide on your next steps:\nBlockers: Are there critical gaps that are deal-breakers (for example, no data export or punitive exit clauses)? This should remove the vendor from consideration.\nMajor risks: Are there issues that could be a deal-breaker (for example, API limitations)? Do a POC before making a decision.\nConcerns: Are there any concerning issues that aren’t critical (for example, uncertainty about the product roadmap)? Contact the vendor to see if they can shed some light.\nLastly, remember to escalate anything affecting compliance, SLAs, or costs to SRE, procurement, and/or legal teams.\nDIY vs. integrated CI/CD platforms: Risks, rewards, and decision criteria\nPartnering with a vendor isn’t your only option for a CI/CD solution. You can also build your own.\nA do-it-yourself (DIY) CI/CD gives you full control to tailor every component to niche needs and stitch together the best available tools. This can be useful for unique architectures or strict compliance demands.\nHowever, that control comes with costs. You must own maintenance, upgrades, security, and scaling, and the glue code between tools often becomes brittle technical debt.\n\nDIY prosDIY cons\nYou have full control of every component; optimize for niche requirements.You own maintenance, upgrades, and security for the entire stack.\nChoose best-of-breed tools for each stage (VCS, runner, artifact store).Integration and cross-tool orchestration add complexity and brittle glue code.\nLower vendor dependency; avoids many proprietary lock-in vectors.Hidden TCO from ops time, custom plugins, and scaling pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose DIY if you need extreme customization, have seasoned DevOps capacity, and want full control over cost levers.\nHowever, if you value developer productivity, shorter time to market, and vendor-managed reliability, opt for an integrated solution.\n\nIntegrated platform prosIntegrated platform cons\nUnified UX, fewer integration points, and faster onboarding for engineers.Some feature gaps or vendor-specific behaviors can be costly to reproduce.\nVendor accountability for reliability, scaling, and parts of security.Pricing models and metering can be hard to forecast as usage grows.\nBuilt-in productivity features (e.g. parallelization, flaky test detection, and visual pipelines).Partial lock-in remains unless the vendor supports portability and exports.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther resources\nTwo-thirds of engineers lose 20%+ of their time to inefficiencies.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA is well-known for its Spring Framework support. The IDE helps with bean navigation, on-the-go bean injection, Spring Data methods completion, and assistance with generating HTTP requests for controllers. One of the areas that IDEA is good at is dealing with JPA. You, as a developer, can:\nGenerate entities based on DB tables.\nCreate diff scripts for Liquibase and Flyway on model changes.\nCompare two DB versions and generate a diff script.\nBefore IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, dealing with Spring Data JDBC required more effort. After creating a table or adding a field, you had to update the code manually or invoke an AI. Finally, we introduce first-class support for Spring Data JDBC. This means the IDE now understands your JDBC entities just as well as it understands JPA and provides the same functionality. Whether you prefer creating a DB schema first or building a proper object model, you can leverage IDEA’s features for your work.\nIn this article, we’ll try to answer the most common questions that usually come up in different daily tasks. We’ll use the following domain model containing Courses, Students and Enrollments as an example.\n\n\n\n\ncreate table courses\n(\n   id          int primary key auto_increment,\n   name        varchar(255) not null,\n   description text\n);\n\ncreate table students\n(\n   id    int primary key auto_increment,\n   name  varchar(255) not null,\n   email varchar(255) not null unique\n);\n\ncreate table enrollments\n(\n   student_id  int       not null,\n   course_id   int       not null,\n   enrolled_at timestamp not null,\n   primary key (student_id, course_id),\n   foreign key (student_id) references students (id),\n   foreign key (course_id) references courses (id)\n);\nGetting Started\nQ: How do I connect IntelliJ IDEA to my database for reverse engineering and diff?\nA: Click on the Database tool window → Click on “+” icon → Data Source → MySQL\nProvide database connection properties and click on Test Connection to verify the connectivity. Click OK to connect to your database.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have datasource properties configured in your application.properties/yml file then you can register DataSource by simply clicking on the gutter icon.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, if you have DataSource registered in the Database tool window, then you can simply drag the connection onto the application.properties/yml file to configure the datasource properties.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How does IntelliJ IDEA detect Spring Data JDBC entities and repositories?\nA: IntelliJ IDEA detects classes with @Id (org.springframework.data.annotation.Id) annotated properties as Spring Data JDBC entities. \nAny interface that extends either org.springframework.data.repository.Repository or any of its sub-interfaces(CrudRepository, ListCrudRepository, PagingAndSortingRepository, etc.) will be automatically detected as Spring Data Repositories.\nQ: IDEA does not detect my entity, what should I do?\nA: In case the automatic detection of entities is not working (for example, currently records with @Id properties without @Table annotation are not automatically detected), then you can explicitly mark them as Spring Data JDBC entities by adding @Table annotation on the class/record or by adding them to Mapping Context as follows:\n\n\n\n\nQ: DB-first or code-first: which workflow should I choose for Spring Data JDBC?\nA: From Spring Data Documentation:\nAll Spring Data modules are inspired by the concepts of “repository”, “aggregate”, and “aggregate root” from Domain Driven Design. These are possibly even more important for Spring Data JDBC, because they are, to some extent, contrary to normal practice when working with relational databases.\nWhile using Spring Data JDBC, it is recommended to follow DDD and start with domain models/entities first.\nQ: When should I use IntelliJ IDEA’s built-in Spring Data JDBC features instead of asking an AI to generate code?\nA: You can use AI planning mode to brainstorm the design and use IntelliJ IDEA’s built-in code generation feature to deterministically generate code. \nIf you are following the code-first approach, you can generate the models using AI and use IntelliJ IDEA to generate Flyway/Liquibase migrations from the entities. \nConversely, if you are following the database-first approach, then you can generate Entities from the existing schema deterministically without any AI and its associated cost.\nQ: What are the current limitations vs JPA support (and where does the IDE intentionally stay hands-off)?\nA: IntelliJ IDEA provides all the necessary support for working with Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC. So, it boils down to the comparison of Spring Data JDBC vs Spring Data JPA features.\nIntelliJ IDEA provides support for both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC with the following:\nGenerating entities from an existing database schema\nInitializing Flyway/Liquibase migrations from entities\nGenerating database migrations from code changes\nSynchronizing database changes into entities\nAutocompletion of Spring Data Repository methods\nOn-demand creation of Spring Data Repository methods\nSchema Evolution and Migration\nQ: How do I generate @Table entities from an existing database schema?\nA: In the Database tool window, right-click on the DataSource connection and select “Create JDBC Entities from DB…”, select the Target package, select the tables you want to generate entities for, and click OK.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How does IntelliJ IDEA handle composite keys during reverse engineering?\nA: While generating Spring Data JDBC entities from the existing schema, for composite keys IntelliJ IDEA generates a class for the ComposeKey and uses @Embedded annotation to define the primary key.\nIn our example, the enrollments table composite key EnrollmentId is generated as follows:\npublic class EnrollmentId {\n   private Integer studentId = 0;\n   private Integer courseId = 0;\n\n   // setters and getters\n}\n\n@Table(name = \"enrollments\")\npublic class Enrollment {\n   @Id\n   @Embedded.Nullable\n   private EnrollmentId id;\n\n   private Instant enrolledAt = Instant.now();\n\n   public Enrollment(@Nullable EnrollmentId id, Instant enrolledAt) {\n       this.id = id;\n       this.enrolledAt = enrolledAt;\n   }\n\n   // setters and getters\n}\nQ: I started with the code-first approach. Can IntelliJ IDEA generate migrations from entities?\nA: Yes. You can generate Flyway or Liquibase Migrations from the entities. Using the entity gutter icon, invoke Flyway/Liquibase Init Migration action, choose the entities and DataSource and generate the migrations.\n\n\n\n\nQ: Can IntelliJ IDEA generate migrations from my code changes?\nA: IntelliJ IDEA can generate Flyway and Liquibase migrations from the code changes (adding new entities, changing or adding entity properties).\n\n\n\n\nQ: What changes should I review manually before applying generated migrations?\nA: In short, ALL. While IntelliJ IDEA detects the database dialect and generates the appropriate database migration scripts, it is better to review before applying.\nYou should also pay attention to the migration change color codes (green, yellow, red) that represent safe, needs attention and dangerous types. The safe operations mostly create new resources(tables, columns, etc) that can be easily reverted. The needs attention type changes alter the schema (rename tables or columns, change datatypes, etc) that could have a significant impact on the application. The dangerous type changes are irreversible, such as dropping a column or table, which should be carefully evaluated and performed with the utmost care.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How does the “Diff & migration scripts” feature handle complex changes, such as renaming a column or changing a data type, between my @Table model and the DB?\nA: When generating migration scripts, IntelliJ IDEA shows the different types of operation in different color codes(green, yellow, red) to represent safe, needs attention and dangerous types.\nFor migrations like renaming a column name or modifying data types, IntelliJ IDEA offers suggestion to rename the column name or update datatype instead of creating a new column and dropping the old column.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with Spring Data\nQ: In DDD, we focus on “Aggregate Roots.” How does IDEA help me stay within those boundaries?\nA: According to DDD principles, an entity should be associated with only one aggregate root. In IntelliJ IDEA, if you try to associate the same entity with multiple aggregates, it will show an inspection warning and provide quick fixes.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How do I create a Spring Data JDBC repository?\nA: You can create Spring Data JDBC Repository by using right-click → Spring Component (Java) → RepositoryName.\n\n\n\n\nProductivity Hacks\nQ: Can I add multiple missing columns to an entity in one go?\nA: You can add the missing columns to an entity by right-clicking on Table → Create Entity Attributes From DB and select all the missing columns.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add one column at a time using column auto completion support.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How do I quickly create a repository and inject it into a service (end-to-end flow)?\nA: A simpler way is to just start typing the {entityName}Repo and IntelliJ IDEA will show an option to create Repository. It will create the Repository and automatically inject in the current bean. Similarly, you can inject any existing bean and start using it by just start typing the Spring bean name.\n\n\n\n\nQ: How “smart” is the derived method completion?\nA: IntelliJ IDEA provides autocompletion for finder methods based on the field names of entity classes and Spring Data JDBC supported keywords.\n\n\n\n\nYou don’t even need to create the Repository methods ahead of time. Wherever you are using the repository, you can start typing the finder method using the autocomplete feature, and IntelliJ IDEA will create that method automatically in the repository.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFirst-class Spring Data JDBC support in IntelliJ IDEA reduces manual work in everyday JDBC tasks. If you prefer a code-first approach, the IDE helps you keep your aggregates and domain model consistent and can generate migration scripts for Flyway or Liquibase that you can review and apply. If you work DB-first, reverse engineering helps you bring database changes back into code with fewer steps. \nAI can definitely help you draft migrations or mappings, but it should not be the source of truth. IntelliJ IDEA inspections and database tools help you verify changes early, before they ship.\nGive it a try in your project, and let us know what works well and what you want to see next.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In December 2024, we published a year-in-review summary of our work on the Scala Plugin. By that time the following year, we were busy releasing IntelliJ IDEA and the Scala Plugin 2025.3, as well as preparing for the upcoming Scala 3.8 release. This was followed by a long holiday break.\nBut as they say, not all who wander are lost. Now, without further ado, let’s take a look back at the main Scala Plugin highlights of 2025.\n\n\n\n\nMain changes to the Scala Plugin\nScala 3 support\nSupporting Scala 3 sometimes feels like chasing a rabbit: While we’re working on delivering support for existing features, the compiler team is building new ones. But we’re closing the gap. Here are some of the features we added support for in 2025:\nNamed tuples\n“Better fors” and refutable patterns in for-comprehensions\nOpaque types\nContext bounds and givens\nThe new into modifier\n\n\n\n\nThe last point (support for into) is part of a larger project to ensure support for Scala 3.8 by the time it is released. Additionally, we introduced several improvements to code resolution and type inference, and addressed some “good code is red” issues in Compiler-based highlighting, making both Built-in and Compiler-based highlighting modes more reliable.\nNamed tuples and their support in Scala Plugin\n\n\n\nsbt\nThe new sbt modules layout is now enabled by default. We made several improvements to the new separate production/test modules and resolved many edge cases discovered since the feature was first released in 2024.3. We also directed a portion of our efforts toward supporting sbt 2.0, as its release is right around the corner.\n\n\n\n\nX-Ray mode\nX-Ray mode enhancements include displaying apply calls, name hints (including for all parameters, not just literals), and clearer indicators of when the apply method is being used instead of a regular constructor. We’ve also improved type hints and info for variable patterns, generators, literal parameters, underscore parameters, and kind projector syntax.\n\n\n\n\nPerformance improvements\nPerformance improvements include faster editor actions and fixes for occasional UI freezes during actions like Show Type Info and Show Implicit Argument. You can disable built-in inspections in Settings for better performance in cases where compiler highlighting will suffice. Tips and contact instructions are also available under Settings. But we’ve got plenty more where that came from and will be announcing further improvements in 2026 – stay tuned!\n\n\n\n\nYou can read about all these changes and many more in detail in our release notes:\nRelease Notes 2025.1\nRelease Notes 2025.2\nRelease Notes 2025.3\n\n\n\n\nAnd in a blog post about our support for Scala 3.8.\n\n\n\n\nState of Developer Ecosystem Survey 2025\nIn what has now become an annual tradition, JetBrains conducted a survey of users of our products. Here are a few key Scala-related insights:\n\n\n\n\nScala 3 popularity\nAmong the 446 people who answered this question, 274 (59%) answered that they use Scala 3 regularly. “Regularly” is a keyword here. We also asked about your usage of different Scala versions at home and at work. Although versions 2.13 and 2.12 are still in use, the percentage of developers who have already switched to Scala 3 but still use Scala 2 at work adds another 15% to the result.\n\n\n\n\nUnit testing frameworks\nScalaTest maintains its top position at 70% (down from 71% last year), but MUnit and ZIOTest are on the rise, coming in at 22% and 17%, respectively (as opposed to 19% and 8% last year).\n\n\n\n\nFrameworks and libraries\nCats, ZIO, and FS2 remain popular, with ZIO having the biggest increase in popularity among them, jumping from 27% in 2024 to 32% in 2025. Akka usage, on the other hand, is trending downward – it was at 35% two years ago, then fell to 30% last year, and is now at 28%. It’s clearly losing users to Pekko, which has risen from 15% to 22%.\n\n\n\n\nHead over to this page to compare this year’s numbers with those of last year. And feel free to check out The State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYouTube videos about the Scala Plugin\nIn December 2024, we released the first video in a new YouTube series about how IntelliJ IDEA supports Scala. Each video is approximately 10 minutes long and discusses one main feature, along with a few smaller, closely related ones. In 2025, we released seven more of these videos, covering various topics from enum support to the debugger. For our mobile users, we also whipped up a few YouTube Shorts addressing the same topics. You can watch them all here.\n\n\n\n\nConferences\nLast but not least, in 2025, we were Gold sponsors at two major Scala conferences: Scalar in March (Warsaw, Poland) and Scala Days in August (Lausanne, Switzerland). At Scalar, we gave a lightning talk on two closely connected Scala Plugin features: inlay hints and X-Ray mode. At Scala Days, we delivered two 40-minute talks. The first was a sort of two-for-one: It addressed how to stay productive with the Scala Plugin and gave a quick status update on Scala 3 and the contributions made to it thus far. The other talk was a walkthrough of AI tooling in IntelliJ IDEA.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s all for now! We hope your 2026 is off to a productive start.\n\n\n\n\nThe Scala team at JetBrains",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR\nRust and JavaScript/TypeScript aren’t competitors – they excel in different domains and are increasingly used together.\nJS/TS offers an unmatched ecosystem depth and rapid iteration, while Rust delivers performance, memory safety, and reliability.\nWebAssembly bridges the two, letting Rust power performance-critical logic inside JS/TS apps.\nHybrid Rust + JS/TS architectures are now common across major companies and open-source projects.\nRust adoption is accelerating, especially in backend, infrastructure, and Wasm-heavy workloads; JS/TS remains dominant for UI and full-stack flexibility.\nModern teams often use JS/TS for the product layer and Rust for the engine beneath it, combining speed with flexibility.\n\n\n\n\nRust and JavaScript/TypeScript (JS/TS) are often perceived as rivals, but in reality, they’re complementary languages that serve different purposes and excel across different domains. They were designed with different goals in mind, which dictate the best use cases for each.\nJavaScript/TypeScript offers benefits such as unmatched flexibility, a massive ecosystem, and rapid iteration. Meanwhile, Rust shines in projects that demand top-tier performance, memory safety, and system-level reliability. \nAnd thanks to technologies like WebAssembly, Rust code can now integrate seamlessly with JS/TS environments, effectively serving as a high-performance engine under a flexible frontend. Such hybrid projects combining Rust with JavaScript/TypeScript are on the rise, reflecting a broader trend of language collaboration. A good example of that is a Rust and TypeScript project using WebAssembly, where Rust handles performance-critical logic, and TS manages the web-facing side.\nThis article dives into the current adoption and use cases of Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript to help you explore how these two languages can work together, including real-world commercial applications.\nRust and JavaScript: Where they stand in 2025\n\n\n\n\nToday, Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript stand out as two languages shaping very different yet complementary domains. According to the 2025 Developer Ecosystem Survey, 10% of developers plan to adopt Rust next year, while TypeScript’s real-world adoption has been higher than any other language over the past five years. The survey’s Language Promise Index indicates that TypeScript, Rust, and Go have the highest perceived growth potential, while JavaScript, PHP, and SQL appear to have reached a plateau. \nLet’s take a closer look at Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript to understand their place in the current software development landscape. \n\nCategoryRustJavaScript / TypeScript\nPrimary strengthPerformance and memory safetyFlexibility and massive ecosystem\nTypical use casesSystems programming, backends, WebAssembly modules, tooling enginesFrontend apps, full stack via Node, prototyping, product layer logic\nExecution modelCompiled, strongly typed, predictable performanceInterpreted or JIT compiled, dynamic or gradually typed\nWebAssembly supportFirst class, highly optimizedWorks as host and integration layer\nDeveloper experienceSteeper learning curve but excellent tooling through Cargo and RustRoverVery fast iteration, strong tooling in VS Code and WebStorm\nEcosystemGrowing crates ecosystem and strong system level toolingLargest library ecosystem in the world\nIdeal role in hybrid stackPerformance engine under JS/TSUI layer, product logic, integration, DX\n\n\n\n\n\nRust\nIn 2024, Rust achieved a significant milestone, reaching an estimated 2.27 million developers, with 709,000 identifying it as their primary programming language. This year, Rust continues to gain traction in areas where performance and safety matter. Its commercial usage increased substantially – between 2021 and 2024, the share of Rust developers using it in production grew by 68.75%.\nRust’s ecosystem is thriving across industries, powering everything from operating systems and browsers to cloud infrastructure, WebAssembly apps, embedded devices, and blockchain platforms. Leaders like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta rely on Rust for its unmatched blend of speed, safety, and scalability – whether in the Linux kernel or the AWS Firecracker microVMs. \nThere’s another rising use case of Rust that points to its natural fit alongside JavaScript/TypeScript: web development. According to JetBrains ecosystem data from 2024, Rust for web development is the third most popular use case, showing how well Rust integrates with the web dev ecosystem.\nJavaScript / TypeScript\nJavaScript remains a ubiquitous choice among developers – it has the largest usage share among professional developers (68.8% in 2025). TypeScript’s tooling and large ecosystem adoption make it a strong “next step” for JS teams. To illustrate the rise of TS: in August 2025, TypeScript overtook both JavaScript and Python in GitHub contributor usage.\n\n\n\n\nThe reasons behind this expanding adoption are clear: the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystems offer remarkable flexibility, making them one of the most powerful environments for modern software development. \nDevelopers can use both languages to build dynamic front-end interfaces and robust back-end services using frameworks like Node.js. This opens the door to developing full-stack applications with a single language. The speed and adaptability of JS/TS make them ideal for rapid prototyping, while the massive plugin and library ecosystems provide ready-made solutions for virtually any challenge, from UI frameworks to complex data handling. \n“Rust is undoubtedly the big star in JavaScript and TypeScript tooling and infrastructure. It addresses the most significant issue in the current tooling ecosystem: performance. And I’m 100% convinced that the safeguards from language and compiler make it easier to create successful tools to begin with.”\n\n            \nStefan Baumgartner\n                                                                Author of the TypeScript Cookbook and TypeScript in 50 Lessons\n                                    \nCommon Use Cases and Projects\nRust’s growing collection of web frameworks now mirrors many of the patterns familiar in JavaScript ecosystems, making it easier for teams to blend both worlds. Actix Web, Axum, Rocket, Warp, Loco, Cot, and full-stack tools like Leptos offer routing, middleware patterns, request handling, and component models that map conceptually to popular JS frameworks. \nFor example, Actix Web and Axum align with the role that Express or Fastify play in the Node.js ecosystem, while Leptos feels closer to React or Svelte in how it structures reactive UI logic, except it’s compiled to WebAssembly for performance.\nHow Rust Web Frameworks Map to Familiar JavaScript Patterns\nRust’s modern web frameworks feel approachable for developers coming from the JavaScript ecosystem. While they are different in typing and execution models, the core concepts like routing, middleware, handlers, and extractors follow patterns that JS developers already use daily.\nActix Web is known for its speed and mature async runtime. It uses an actor model that let’s you build highly concurrent services without complex coordination logic. For teams experienced with high-throughput Node servers or frameworks like Fastify, Actix Web offers a similar emphasis on efficiency, but with Rust’s predictability and stronger guarantees around memory safety and performance.\nAxum takes a modular, middleware-driven approach. It’s built on top of the Tower ecosystem, and it promotes clear separation between routing, request handling, and service composition. Developers who appreciate the flexibility of Koa or modern frameworks in the Deno ecosystem often find Axum intuitive because it leans on composable primitives and a clean, type-first design. If you want to see this approach in action, this short Axum tutorial walks through a real example. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket focuses on ergonomics. Its declarative routing and macro-powered syntax reduce boilerplate and make handler definitions straightforward. This resonates with developers who enjoy the expressiveness of decorator-driven frameworks such as NestJS, but want the reliability of a compiled language. With Rocket 1.0 stabilized, the framework has become a dependable option for production APIs and prototypes alike.\n\n\n\n\nTogether, these frameworks show how Rust’s server-side ecosystem has evolved into a space where JS/TS developers can transition smoothly, adopting familiar patterns with the added benefit of stronger safety guarantees and more predictable performance\nWhy These Frameworks Matter in Hybrid Architectures\nAs more teams blend Rust with JavaScript or TypeScript, frameworks like Actix Web, Axum, and Rocket become essential building blocks for the backend or core logic layer. They address the limits that Node services often encounter, especially under high load, CPU-heavy operations, or strict latency requirements. \nRust’s concurrency model and predictable throughput make these frameworks a strong fit for performance-sensitive backend logic, while JS/TS continues to drive the UI and application layer.\nThey also integrate cleanly with modern API tooling, making it easy to expose REST or gRPC interfaces that TypeScript clients consume reliably. For teams working with WebAssembly, these frameworks complement workflows where browser modules and backend services share Rust-based components. \nThe result is a hybrid architecture where JavaScript drives the user experience and rapid iteration, while Rust powers the critical paths that require precision and speed.\nRust’s WebAssembly Capabilities and JavaScript Integration\nWebAssembly serves as the practical bridge that allows Rust and JavaScript to collaborate within the browser. You can compile Rust directly to Wasm, allowing JavaScript to call into high-performance Rust functions whenever a task demands more speed or predictability than JS alone can provide. \nThis model is increasingly common as more teams use Rust-compiled Wasm for image processing, data visualization pipelines, physics simulations, cryptography, and other computation-intensive routines that would slow down or block a JS app if implemented purely in JavaScript.\nThe workflow is straightforward: JavaScript or TypeScript continues to handle the majority of the application, like UI rendering, event handling, state management, and routing, while Rust takes on focused, performance-critical modules. \nWhat you get is a JS/TS application with specialized Rust components quietly accelerating the hardest parts. \nMany teams now rely on this pattern, using Rust-powered WebAssembly modules to offload complex calculations while keeping the rest of the codebase in familiar JavaScript/TypeScript. It’s a complementary approach that strengthens modern web workflows without replacing established frontend practices (and causing lots of headaches!).\nReal-World Patterns for Introducing Rust Web Frameworks into JS/TS Workflows\nTeams adopting Rust alongside JavaScript and TypeScript often begin with incremental changes, using Rust frameworks as clean entry points into existing systems.\nA common starting point is replacing a single Node microservice with an Actix Web or Axum service, especially for tasks like data processing, authentication, or analytics where Node struggles under load. TypeScript clients generated from OpenAPI help keep the integration smooth.\nAnother pattern is using Rocket or Axum to build backend services for React or Next.js applications. These Rust services offer predictable latency under high concurrency, while the JS/TS frontend maintains flexibility and fast iteration cycles.\nFor teams working with WebAssembly, Rust’s web frameworks pair naturally with workflows where browser modules and server components share Rust-based logic.\nTogether, these patterns show how Rust frameworks extend JS/TS workflows by handling performance critical components without disrupting the broader development process.\nRust vs JavaScript: Ecosystem, Tooling, and Developer Experience\nEcosystem\nFor developers coming from the JavaScript world, the Rust ecosystem can feel both familiar and refreshingly different. JavaScript thrives on its extensive library ecosystem, rapidly evolving frameworks, and package managers. Rust offers a more streamlined environment, with its standard toolchain centered around Cargo, which serves as a unified build system, dependency manager, test runner, and project scaffolder. \nTooling\nOn the tooling side, JS developers often rely on WebStorm or VS Code, while Rust developers increasingly use RustRover, IntelliJ with a Rust plugin or CLion with Rust support for a more integrated development experience. \nAccording to the 2024 State of Rust Survey, VS Code remains the most commonly used editor for Rust, followed by Neovim and IntelliJ based IDEs, highlighting a split between lightweight editors and full featured IDEs depending on workflow preferences and project complexity.\nGet started with RustRover\n                                    \nCommunities\nWhen comparing communities, you can expect JavaScript’s scale to be unparalleled – reflecting decades of growth, numerous tutorials, and widespread industry adoption. Rust’s community is smaller but expanding rapidly, especially among developers seeking stronger safety guarantees or exploring alternatives to traditional Java-based backend stacks (this is why comparing Rust to Java makes so much sense!).\nDeveloper experience\nWhen surveyed using the JetBrains Language Promise Index, JavaScript sits firmly in the “mature and stable” category: widely adopted, battle-tested, and unlikely to fade. Rust, in contrast, scores high in terms of long-term potential and upward momentum. Its promise comes from a combination of safety, performance, and growing enterprise interest. These are traits that appeal to teams modernizing infrastructure or boosting their existing Java or JS stacks.\nIn practice, developers don’t have to choose between Rust and JavaScript. Rust brings predictability, performance, and modern tooling, such as Cargo and RustRover; JavaScript offers flexibility, a broad ecosystem, and a massive support network. Together, they form a complementary set of tools that let teams build faster, safer, and more maintainable software.\nDeveloper Adoption of Rust vs JavaScript\nRust learning curve and resources \nRust adoption today spans a wide range of organizations – from cloud platforms to fast-moving startups – giving the programming language solid credibility in real-world production systems. \nCompanies we all know, like Cloudflare, Figma, Discord, Amazon, and Dropbox, use Rust for performance-critical services, security-sensitive components, or infrastructure tooling. Startups building developer tools, edge runtimes, and data platforms increasingly choose Rust for its blend of speed and safety. \nIn the open-source space, many modern projects combine Rust and JavaScript, using Rust for core engines and JavaScript/TypeScript for the surrounding UI or integration layers. Examples include frameworks, linters, build tools, and WebAssembly-powered libraries that offload heavy tasks from JS/TS to Rust.\nIf you’re curious about how to get started after seeing these real-world use cases, our blog post How to Learn Rust walks through a practical learning path. \nStill, Rust’s learning curve can be steeper than JavaScript’s – especially in terms of the ownership and borrowing model. But once you understand these concepts, Rust tends to produce more predictable and maintainable systems. High-quality resources support this ramp-up: comprehensive documentation like Rust Book, courses and Rust exercises, and robust tooling such as RustRover. \nThis combination of industry adoption, open-source momentum, and strong educational materials makes Rust a reliable long-term skill for developers looking to expand beyond traditional JavaScript workflows.\nLearning curve and resources for JS/TS developers\nIf you’re a seasoned JavaScript developer looking to dip your toes into the world of Rust, you can use plenty of beginner-friendly resources, such as in-depth Rust guides or community-driven guides focused on WebAssembly and JavaScript integration. For experienced engineers who love to learn right inside the IDE, RustRover is a strong solution. You get a faster and more structured way to learn the language, thanks to its intelligent tooling, code insights, and smooth project setup.\nThe Rust community itself is a major advantage: active forums, Discord servers, meetups, and strong tooling support create a welcoming environment for newcomers. \nWhen exploring Rust, many JS/TS developers start small. For example, you can add a single Rust module to an existing JavaScript/TypeScript project to speed up a computationally intensive task, image transformation, or parsing operation – and then expand your Rust footprint as you gain confidence. \nThis incremental approach works well, especially in a job market where both junior developers (61%) and senior developers (54%) report challenges; expanding into Rust can open new opportunities without abandoning familiar JavaScript workflows. For JS/TS developers, experimenting with Rust isn’t about replacing what they know but enhancing their toolkit with a language that fits naturally alongside their existing skills.\nHow Rust and JS/TS Work Together\nModern teams are increasingly combining Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript in the same workflow, especially when performance is a key consideration. A common pattern is to compile Rust to WebAssembly and call it directly from JS/TS. \nThis is ideal for tasks such as data parsing, image processing, simulation code, or crypto routines, where Rust WebAssembly‘s performance offers a clear advantage. The approach complements the JS/TS side, which continues to manage UI, routing, and application logic. \nAs much as 85% of developers are already using AI assistants. The openness to adopt new tools opens the doors to experimenting with Rust and JavaScript hybrid architectures. \nJS/TS handles frontend and routine development tasks, while Rust modules (including those implemented via WebAssembly) take on performance-intensive tasks or critical backend services. This illustrates complementary usage without claiming one language is superior.\nExample: Calling a Rust-compiled Wasm module from TypeScript\nimport init, { compute_heavy_task } from \"./pkg/my_rust_module.js\";\n\nasync function run() {\n  await init(\"./pkg/my_rust_module_bg.wasm\");\n  const result = compute_heavy_task(500000);\n  console.log(\"Result:\", result);\n}\n\nrun();\nThis approach gives teams the best of both worlds: JS/TS drives the product experience, while Rust takes over for the parts that require speed, safety, or system-level control.\nCommercial usage of Rust and JS/TS: 3 Examples\nFigma\nFigma is a web-based design platform that pairs Rust and WebAssembly with a TypeScript- and React-driven interface. Its core graphics rendering and heavy computational tasks are compiled from Rust to Wasm, giving the browser near-native performance for operations like vector math, canvas manipulation, and real-time collaboration updates. \nMeanwhile, the application’s main interface, interaction logic, and overall user experience are built with TypeScript and React, allowing rapid iteration and a rich, responsive UI layer. This blend of Rust/Wasm for performance-critical work and JS/TS for product development speed is a central reason Figma feels both powerful and fluid inside the browser.\nBiome\nBiome is a performant toolchain for web projects. It provides developer tools that help maintain the health and consistency of those projects. It is designed to be used through LSP integrations in editors and the CLI to format and lint code.\nBiome is designed to be used through a CLI and editor integrations via the Language Server Protocol. While it supports both JavaScript and TypeScript projects, Biome itself does not rely on JavaScript or TypeScript internally. Instead, it replaces traditional JavaScript based tooling like Prettier and ESLint with a Rust implemented alternative focused on speed, reliability, and developer experience.\n“Biome aims to replace existing JavaScript tooling like Prettier and ESLint with a Rust-implemented toolchain that offers better performance and a more consistent developer experience.”\n\n            \nDenis Bezrukov, Core Contributor in Biome\n                                                        \nCloudflare\nCloudflare’s edge computing platform relies heavily on Rust to power its secure, high-performance serverless runtimes, including the foundation of Cloudflare Workers. Rust handles the low-level execution engine, network operations, isolation layers, and overall runtime reliability. \nOn top of this Rust-powered infrastructure, developers write their actual edge logic in JavaScript or TypeScript, which Cloudflare compiles and runs across its global network. This pairing enables Cloudflare to provide a fast and secure edge platform built on Rust while offering developers the familiarity and flexibility of the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem.\nConclusion\nAs you can see, Rust and JavaScript/TypeScript work best not as alternatives but as complementary layers of the same stack.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With more than 200 new members joining the JetBrains Content Creator community, we were bound to hear some exciting new things from them in 2025. Our members were steadily increasing in number, honing their YouTube videos, tirelessly keeping up with the posting schedule, and providing JetBrains perks directly to their audiences. But the real results of their work made us especially proud, so we decided to dedicate an entire article to our creators and their year!\nOur wins start with folks who improved their lives thanks to their unstoppable creativity:\n“One of my biggest accomplishments in 2025 has been taking my personal brand to the next level and turning it into something that now works very much like a company. This year I’ve been able to fully live off my content…largely thanks to the quality of the content and the steady growth of my community,”\n\n            \nsays Carlos Belenguer Jover, a TikTok creator and Twitch streamer working under the name @melenitasdev.\nThe growth, according to Carlos, is the result of people’s genuine desire to learn programming through accessible and fun content. To us, it was inspiring to hear how JetBrains products were a key part of that journey:\n“I use them daily in my own work and naturally across my videos and livestreams, and they’ve become deeply integrated into how I create, code, and teach.”\n\n            \nAn unexpected tool switch\nSome creator stories consisted of happy accidents, as was the case for YouTube creator Miguel Teheran:\n“My story started three months ago when my Windows laptop showed me a strange white screen and after that it couldn’t turn on again…I decided to buy a used MacBook and use the Apple ecosystem since I use macOS [at work] as well. I installed Rider [and] all of my content in my channel is now recorded with Rider and I am motivating people to try this tool.”\n\n            \nHitting massive reach and recognition\nFor all successful creators, personal highlights are connected to growth, and JetBrains creators grew big time in 2025. Anton Martynyuk’s newsletter at https://antondevtips.com has grown to more than 20K subscribers and Anton himself was recognized as a Microsoft MVP.\n“JetBrains tools have helped a lot on this journey, as I use Rider, DataGrip, AI Assistant, and Junie every day.”\n\n            \nThis wasn’t the first time Rider was mentioned to us. Adam Myhre frequently features it on the git-amend YouTube channel. As far as highlights go, Adam won Best Tutorial Series at Unity Awards 2025 and surpassed 2.5M views across his entire channel.\n“Rider continues to be a major part of every video! Thank you for your support!”\n\n            \nSome of our champions almost tripled their growth targets, like Luciano Souza’s YouTube channel and other social media:\n“In 2025 I’ve reached 140M views across networks (Instagram, X, and LinkedIn) and my goal was 50M through the year. I’m very happy with those results and all the effects that this brings to my career as a Software Engineer and Content Creator, and obviously JetBrains was with me on that.”\n\n            \nBeyond content: Books, OSS, and more\nTwo of our creators shone with projects outside of the content space: Jens Oliver Meiert wrote an entire book dedicated to web development, as did Ashley Allen, who published his Web Dev’s Guide to Freelancing.\n“It’s been a productive and impactful year, and I’m very happy about the results – thanks in good part to WebStorm!”\n\n            \n— Jens\n                                                        \n“I wrote the entire book in PhpStorm, using Markdown files for content, then wrote/ran scripts to generate the PDF and EPUB files. Being able to do all this inside PhpStorm was a massive help for my workflow because I could get instant feedback on the book as I was writing it, all without leaving my IDE. JetBrains also played a part in this book by providing a discount code for all the book’s readers, which I am incredibly grateful for!”\n\n            \n— Ashley\n                                                        \nHighlights for Ashley included using PhpStorm to maintain open-source Laravel/PHP packages totaling 3.1M downloads. For Jens, the entire year was dedicated to writing articles – more than a hundred of them – as well as various refactorings for Frontend Dogma and meiert.com.\nThese stories highlight something developers rarely talk about: using an IDE to manage the entire production – content, scripts, builds, and revisions – without constantly switching tools.\nLearning through community\nSeveral creators highlighted not just tools, but the broader ecosystem around them – from plugins and marketplaces to how new technologies reach developers. Saving the best for last, we decided to include Serena Sensini’s quote in full:\n“I’ve been using JetBrains tools for a long, long time, and I’m super happy to be a partner, because this gave me the opportunity to make our followers [explore] the different products you develop, but especially to give people [a chance] to explore different and innovative ways to code. Bringing emerging technologies to the community through the implementation of a huge marketplace and its plugins, your work with the external communication and community engagement, is incredible and I really need to thank you for that.”\n\n            \nThese stories go beyond individual wins. Creators’ workflows, feedback, and experiments shape how we think about the developer experience, tooling, and community. We’re grateful to everyone who shared their stories with us this year, with a special shoutout to Gerson Azabache Martinez, Ali Bouali, Artem Kondranin, and Faisal Memon.\nInspired by these stories?\nApplications to the JetBrains Content Creator Program are open. If you create developer-focused content and want support, tools, and a community that grows with you, we’d love to hear from you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Cameron Pavey, draft.dev.\nJenkins has served the development community well for over a decade, but it was designed for a different era of software development. Developers who are tired of fighting with plugin compatibility issues, slow builds, and brittle configurations are exploring alternatives.\nBut is your organization ready for the move? What is the actual work involved? And how do you communicate the benefits of a more modern CI/CD solution to leadership to get their buy-in?\nOur migration planning kit answers these questions:\nThe migration-readiness assessment scores and plots your organization’s readiness against the pain you’re experiencing with Jenkins to determine whether you are an ideal migration candidate, need to address foundational issues first, or ought to focus on other priorities.\nYou’ll see how Jenkins patterns compare to TeamCity to assess the effort required and plan for an effective migration.\nThe safe migration plan guides you through the five phases of a successful migration: discovery & assessment, pilot setup, incremental migration, optimization, and full cutover.\nYou’ll get templates and guidance on how to communicate the benefits of migration to management.\nThis guide contains a lot of information, so feel free to use the hyperlinks above to navigate to the information that’s most relevant for you right now.\nMigration-readiness checklist: Assessing your team’s preparation\nBefore considering any migration, you need an honest assessment of your current CI/CD maturity and readiness for change. The following self-evaluation will help you determine whether migration is the right next step and identify areas that need attention.\nOrganizational-readiness assessment\nStart by evaluating how your organization manages Jenkins infrastructure and pipeline development.\nDo you manage Jenkins centrally, or is it distributed across teams? Centralized management typically indicates better standardization and makes migration coordination easier. Distributed management may require more planning but often means teams have stronger pipeline ownership.\nDo you have standardized pipeline practices across your organization? If you have consistent patterns, shared libraries, and documented standards, you are typically better positioned for migration because you’ve already solved many of the organizational challenges. If your pipelines vary dramatically between projects, consider standardizing approaches before migrating.\nAre your builds reliable, or do you regularly experience flaky failures? This question reveals both technical debt and team practices. Reliable builds point to good testing practices and stable infrastructure, while frequent flakiness could be due to underlying issues that migration alone won’t solve.\nTechnical-inventory questions\nUnderstanding your current Jenkins footprint is essential for planning.\nHow many Jenkinsfiles do you maintain across all repositories? This gives you a scope estimate for the migration effort. Count both declarative pipelines and freestyle jobs that would need conversion.\nWhich Jenkins plugins are actively used in your pipelines? Create a comprehensive list including build tools, deployment integrations, notification systems, and reporting plugins. Research TeamCity equivalents for critical plugins, and identify any that might require custom development or workflow changes.\nDo you have custom integrations, scripts, or Jenkins extensions? Custom code represents the highest migration risk because it cannot be automatically translated to TeamCity: Each integration must be completely rebuilt using different APIs, often without clear documentation of the original business requirements or dependencies. Document any custom plugins, shared libraries, or external integrations that directly interact with Jenkins APIs.\nCI/CD pain point analysis\nConsider and identify the specific problems migration should solve for your team.\nAre your builds slow, or do you experience frequent bottlenecks? Common issues include slow build agents, inefficient artifact management, poor parallelization, and resource contention during peak hours. Having a clear goal is important as it will inform decisions throughout the migration process.\nDo you face debugging challenges regularly? Consider how much time your team spends investigating pipeline failures, tracking down build-environment issues, or understanding why tests behave differently in CI versus local environments.\nDo you have scalability issues that limit your current setup? Look for signs like build queues during busy periods, difficulty adding new projects, or infrastructure costs that grow faster than your team size.\nDo you want more control over your pipeline logic and infrastructure? If you are frequently working around Jenkins limitations or investing significant time in custom solutions, you would likely benefit greatly from TeamCity’s more flexible architecture.\nDo you need better visibility into flaky or slow tests? If your team struggles to identify unreliable tests or understand performance bottlenecks, TeamCity’s built-in test intelligence can provide immediate value.\nAre you spending more time maintaining CI infrastructure than building products? This is often the clearest signal that your current platform has become a productivity drain rather than an enabler.\nInterpreting your migration assessment\nLet’s now determine your readiness for migration.\nYou can find a printable version of this readiness checklist in the supporting files.\nFirst, calculate two separate scores:\nReadiness score:\nGive yourself 1 point for each “Yes”:\nCentralized Jenkins management\nStandardized pipeline practices across teams\nReliable builds with minimal flaky failures\nClear inventory of Jenkinsfiles and plugins\nDocumented custom integrations and dependencies\nPain score:\nGive yourself 1 point for each “Yes”:\nSlow builds or frequent bottlenecks\nRegular debugging challenges consuming team time\nScalability issues limiting growth\nNeed for more pipeline control and flexibility\nPoor visibility into test performance and failures\nMore time spent maintaining than building\nMigration recommendation\n\n\n\n\nLow readiness (0–3 points) + high pain (4–6 points): Address foundational issues first, but consider that TeamCity’s better tooling can help with cleanup. Start with organizational improvements and a small pilot.\nLow readiness (0–3 points) + low pain (0–3 points): Migration is not a priority. Focus on other improvements to your development process first.\nWhy choose TeamCity?\nKnowing when it’s time to migrate is only part of the puzzle. You also need to have a solid platform to migrate to. TeamCity addresses the core problems that drive teams away from Jenkins while providing capabilities that simply don’t exist in older CI/CD platforms. Consider the following, to list just a few:\nKotlin DSL for maintainable pipeline logic\nTeamCity’s Kotlin DSL provides type safety, IDE support, and compile-time validation. You can create reusable templates, refactor configurations with confidence, and catch errors before committing changes. Complex pipeline logic becomes maintainable code rather than fragile scripts that break unexpectedly.\nBuilt-in test intelligence\nFlaky test detection, automatic failure assignment, and a comprehensive test history are native platform features. TeamCity identifies which tests fail inconsistently, tracks patterns across builds, and assigns investigations based on recent changes. You’re not parsing logs or building custom solutions to understand test failures; the platform tells you what’s wrong and who should fix it.\nEnterprise orchestration without enterprise complexity\nBuild chains, artifact dependencies, and parallel execution work without extensive configuration or specialized expertise. Visual pipeline editors make complex workflows immediately comprehensible to new team members. You gain sophisticated orchestration capabilities without the operational overhead typically associated with enterprise platforms.\nHow do Jenkins pipelines compare to TeamCity?\nUnderstanding how your existing Jenkins patterns translate to TeamCity will help you determine what kinds of workflows you need to create as part of planning for an effective migration.\nPipelines vs. Build Chains\nTeamCity offers two complementary approaches for defining build workflows: Build Chains and Pipelines. Build Chains is an established method for modeling dependencies and complex workflows, while Pipelines, a new feature as of version 2025.07, provides a modern pipeline experience. While Pipelines is a newer feature that does not yet support as many use cases as the more battle-hardened Build Chains, it offers a more familiar and intuitive interface for teams migrating from Jenkins.\nThe specifics of the CI/CD processes you’re looking to implement will determine which option is best for you.\nOpt for Build Chains if:\nYou need mature, production-ready orchestration with advanced features like artifact dependencies, custom triggers, and snapshot isolation.\nYour workflows involve large monorepos or multiproject builds where many components must be built, tested, and deployed in a coordinated fashion.\nStability and long-term support matter more than having the latest pipeline syntax.\nOpt for Pipelines if:\nYou want a modern, YAML-based pipeline-as-code approach that feels closer to Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.\nYour workflows are relatively straightforward (build → test → deploy) and don’t require deep artifact or snapshot dependency modeling.\nYou value developer-friendly ergonomics and repo-first configuration over enterprise-grade complexity.\nSample patterns\nBoth Build Chains and Pipelines support Kotlin DSL for configuration (Kotlin DSL support is coming to Pipelines after 2025.11), which offers significant advantages over traditional Jenkinsfile syntax.\nThe following side-by-side examples compare common Jenkins pipeline patterns with TeamCity’s Kotlin DSL, showing syntax differences and TeamCity’s enhanced native capabilities.\nDeclarative pipeline definition\nJenkins’s declarative pipelines use a YAML-like syntax within Groovy that can become verbose and error-prone:\n// Jenkinsfile\n\npipeline {\n\n    agent any\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Build') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh 'echo \"Building application...\"'\n\n                sh './gradlew build'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stage('Test') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './gradlew test'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stage('Deploy') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './deploy.sh'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity’s Kotlin DSL provides type safety and better IDE support:\n// .teamcity/settings.kts\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.*\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.buildSteps.script\n\nimport jetbrains.buildServer.configs.kotlin.triggers.vcs\n\nobject Build : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Build and Deploy\"\n\n    vcs {\n\n        root(DslContext.settingsRoot)\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Build\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"\"\"\n\n                echo \"Building application...\"\n\n                ./gradlew build\n\n            \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n        }\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Test\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./gradlew test\"\n\n        }\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Deploy\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./deploy.sh\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    triggers {\n\n        vcs {\n\n            branchFilter = \"+:*\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nTriggering builds on VCS commits\nJenkins requires either polling or webhook configuration with plugins:\npipeline {\n\n    triggers {\n\n        pollSCM('H/5 * * * *')  // Poll every 5 minutes\n\n        // OR\n\n        githubPush()  // Requires GitHub plugin\n\n    }\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Build on Commit') {\n\n            when {\n\n                anyOf {\n\n                    branch 'main'\n\n                    branch 'develop'\n\n                    changeRequest()\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './build.sh'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides native VCS integration with sophisticated branch filtering:\nobject BuildOnCommit : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Build on VCS Commit\"\n\n    vcs {\n\n        root(DslContext.settingsRoot)\n\n        branchFilter = \"\"\"\n\n            +:refs/heads/main\n\n            +:refs/heads/develop\n\n            +:refs/heads/feature/*\n\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    }\n\n    triggers {\n\n        vcs {\n\n            branchFilter = \"+:*\"\n\n            enableQueueOptimization = false\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Build Application\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./build.sh\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nEnvironment variables and configuration\nJenkins handles environment variables through pipeline syntax:\npipeline {\n\n    environment {\n\n        DATABASE_URL = 'jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb'\n\n        API_KEY = credentials('api-key')\n\n    }\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Deploy') {\n\n            environment {\n\n                DEPLOY_ENV = 'staging'\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh 'echo \"Deploying to ${DEPLOY_ENV}\"'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides more flexible parameter management with type safety:\nobject Deploy : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Deploy Application\"\n\n    params {\n\n        text(\"database.url\", \"jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mydb\")\n\n        password(\"api.key\", \"credentialsJSON:api-key\")\n\n        select(\"deploy.environment\", \"staging\", options = listOf(\"staging\", \"production\"))\n\n    }\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            scriptContent = \"\"\"\n\n                echo \"Deploying to %deploy.environment%\"\n\n                ./deploy.sh --env %deploy.environment%\n\n            \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\nTest reporting integration\nJenkins requires plugins for comprehensive test reporting:\npipeline {\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Test') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './gradlew test'\n\n            }\n\n            post {\n\n                always {\n\n                    publishTestResults([\n\n                        testResultsFiles: 'build/test-results/test/*.xml',\n\n                        allowEmptyResults: false\n\n                    ])\n\n                    publishHTML([\n\n                        allowMissing: false,\n\n                        alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,\n\n                        keepAll: true,\n\n                        reportDir: 'build/reports/tests/test',\n\n                        reportFiles: 'index.html',\n\n                        reportName: 'Test Report'\n\n                    ])\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides built-in test intelligence with automatic failure assignment:\nobject TestWithReporting : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Test with Reporting\"\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Run Tests\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./gradlew test\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    features {\n\n        xmlReport {\n\n            reportType = XmlReport.XmlReportType.JUNIT\n\n            rules = \"build/test-results/test/*.xml\"\n\n        }\n\n        htmlReport {\n\n            reportDir = \"build/reports/tests/test\"\n\n            startPage = \"index.html\"\n\n            reportName = \"Test Results\"\n\n        }\n\n        investigationsAutoAssigner {\n\n            users = \"teamlead\"\n\n            assignOnSecondFailure = true\n\n            assignOnNewFailure = true\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    failureConditions {\n\n        executionTimeoutMin = 30\n\n        testFailure = false  // Don't fail build on test failures, just report\n\n    }\n\n})\nConditional stages and matrix builds\nJenkins’s conditional logic can become complex and hard to maintain:\npipeline {\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Deploy to Production') {\n\n            when {\n\n                branch 'main'\n\n                environment name: 'DEPLOY_PROD', value: 'true'\n\n            }\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './deploy-prod.sh'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    strategy {\n\n        matrix {\n\n            axes {\n\n                axis {\n\n                    name 'JAVA_VERSION'\n\n                    values '11', '17', '21'\n\n                }\n\n                axis {\n\n                    name 'OS'\n\n                    values 'ubuntu-latest', 'windows-latest'\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stages {\n\n            stage('Test Matrix') {\n\n                steps {\n\n                    sh './test-java-${JAVA_VERSION}.sh'\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity’s approach is more explicit and maintainable, with better reusability:\nobject ProductionDeploy : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Production Deploy\"\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Deploy to Production\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./deploy-prod.sh\"\n\n            conditions {\n\n                equals(\"teamcity.build.branch\", \"main\")\n\n                equals(\"deploy.environment\", \"production\")\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n})\n\n// Matrix builds as separate build configurations with reusable functions\n\nfun createTestBuild(javaVersion: String, os: String): BuildType {\n\n    return BuildType({\n\n        name = \"Test Java $javaVersion on $os\"\n\n        params {\n\n            text(\"java.version\", javaVersion)\n\n            text(\"agent.os\", os)\n\n        }\n\n        steps {\n\n            script {\n\n                scriptContent = \"./test-java-%java.version%.sh\"\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        requirements {\n\n            equals(\"system.os\", os)\n\n        }\n\n    })\n\n}\n\n// Create matrix builds programmatically\n\nval testBuilds = listOf(\n\n    createTestBuild(\"11\", \"Linux\"),\n\n    createTestBuild(\"17\", \"Linux\"),\n\n    createTestBuild(\"21\", \"Linux\"),\n\n    createTestBuild(\"11\", \"Windows\"),\n\n    createTestBuild(\"17\", \"Windows\"),\n\n    createTestBuild(\"21\", \"Windows\")\n\n)\nArtifact management\nJenkins’s artifact handling requires careful configuration and lacks sophisticated dependency management:\npipeline {\n\n    stages {\n\n        stage('Build') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                sh './gradlew build'\n\n            }\n\n            post {\n\n                success {\n\n                    archiveArtifacts([\n\n                        artifacts: 'build/libs/*.jar,build/distributions/*.zip',\n\n                        allowEmptyArchive: false,\n\n                        fingerprint: true\n\n                    ])\n\n                }\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n        stage('Deploy') {\n\n            steps {\n\n                // Copy artifacts from upstream build\n\n                copyArtifacts([\n\n                    projectName: 'upstream-job',\n\n                    selector: lastSuccessful(),\n\n                    target: 'artifacts/'\n\n                ])\n\n                sh 'deploy.sh artifacts/*.jar'\n\n            }\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\nTeamCity provides sophisticated artifact management, with dependency tracking and automatic cleanup:\nobject BuildWithArtifacts : BuildType({\n\n    name = \"Build and Archive\"\n\n    steps {\n\n        script {\n\n            name = \"Build Application\"\n\n            scriptContent = \"./gradlew build\"\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n    artifactRules = \"\"\"\n\n        build/libs/*.jar =>

approach become clear when you’re managing complex pipelines:\nType safety and IDE support: Your IDE can provide autocompletion, refactoring tools, and compile-time error checking for pipeline configurations. This eliminates the trial-and-error cycles common with Jenkinsfile development.\nReusability and modularity: You can create reusable functions, templates, and shared configuration objects. This reduces duplication and makes it easier to maintain consistent patterns across multiple projects.\nVersion-control integration: Kotlin DSL configurations are easier to review in pull requests, track changes over time, and understand the impact of modifications. The type system makes it clearer what each change affects.\nWhat does a safe migration plan look like?\nSuccessfully migrating from Jenkins to a more modern system requires a structured, phased approach that minimizes risk while incrementally proving value as you go.\nYou’ll get the most value out of your migration if you don’t treat it as a direct-translation exercise but as an opportunity to modernize and improve your CI/CD workflows.\nPhase 1: Discovery and assessment\nGoal: Understand your current Jenkins environment and identify the biggest challenges you want to overcome through migration.\nKey question: What are the most significant problems we want to solve by migrating, and how will you measure success?\nThe discovery phase involves conducting a comprehensive audit of your Jenkins instances and documenting all active jobs, pipelines, and their dependencies. Create an inventory that includes Jenkinsfiles, freestyle jobs, shared libraries, custom plugins, and external integrations. Pay special attention to identifying critical pipelines that cannot afford downtime and any custom functionality that might require special handling.\nThis audit should go beyond simple documentation. Ask what business goal each Jenkins pipeline was originally designed to accomplish. Many complex Jenkins configurations exist as workarounds for platform limitations rather than optimal solutions. Similarly, some pipelines may have evolved organically, accumulating complexity that can be eliminated in a fresh implementation.\nDuring this phase, engage with development teams to understand their pain points with the current system. Document specific examples of maintenance overhead, debugging challenges, and workflow inefficiencies. This information will guide your migration priorities and help you measure the success of your TeamCity implementation.\nPhase 2: Pilot setup\nGoal: Set up a low-risk TeamCity environment, and demonstrate core capabilities with a representative workload.\nKey question: Can you prove measurable value at a small scale before committing to a broader migration?\nChoose a pilot project that represents typical patterns in your organization but won’t impact critical business operations if problems occur. This might be an internal tool, a staging-environment pipeline, or a new feature-branch workflow. The goal is to validate TeamCity’s capabilities with real work while building team confidence.\nResist the temptation to simply recreate your Jenkins pipeline as is in TeamCity. Treat the pilot as an opportunity to implement best practices from the start. Use TeamCity’s visual build chains to clarify pipeline dependencies, leverage Kotlin DSL for maintainable configuration, and take advantage of built-in features like test parallelization and flaky test detection.\nSet up side-by-side comparisons where possible. Run the same builds in both Jenkins and TeamCity to compare performance, reliability, and developer experience. Document specific improvements, such as reduced build times, clearer failure diagnostics, or easier configuration management.\nCollect detailed feedback from the development team using the pilot system. Focus on daily workflow impact. Is it easier to understand build failures? Are configuration changes simpler to make? Does the system provide better visibility into test results?\nPhase 3: Incremental migration\nGoal: Migrate remaining pipelines based on complexity and business criticality while maintaining Jenkins as a fallback option.\nKey question: How can you migrate safely without disrupting team productivity or deployment capabilities?\nDevelop a migration priority matrix based on pipeline complexity, business criticality, and team readiness. Start with simpler, less critical pipelines to build expertise and confidence. Save the most complex or business-critical systems for later when your team has developed migration best practices.\nFor each pipeline migration, follow a consistent modernization approach. Review the original Jenkins implementation to understand its intended purpose. Then, design a TeamCity solution that accomplishes the same goals using native platform capabilities. This often results in simpler, more maintainable configurations.\nMaintain Jenkins pipelines in parallel during this phase so you can do quick rollbacks if issues arise. Use feature flags or branch-based routing to gradually shift traffic to TeamCity while keeping Jenkins as a safety net. This parallel operation also allows you to validate that TeamCity implementations produce identical results.\nUse Kotlin DSL consistently for new TeamCity configurations. This investment in type-safe, maintainable pipeline definitions pays dividends as your migration scales and more teams adopt the platform.\nPhase 4: Optimization\nGoal: Take full advantage of TeamCity’s advanced features to achieve benefits beyond basic pipeline migration.\nKey question: How can you unlock capabilities that weren’t possible with Jenkins to improve development velocity and quality?\nThis phase focuses on using TeamCity’s built-in intelligence and optimization features. Enable flaky test detection to automatically identify unreliable tests that waste developer time. Configure test parallelization to reduce build times and provide faster feedback on changes.\nImplement visual build chains to make complex workflows easier to understand and maintain. Use TeamCity’s dependency management to optimize resource utilization and reduce unnecessary work. Take advantage of TeamCity’s superior observability features. Set up dashboards that provide clear visibility into build performance, test results, and system health. Configure meaningful notifications that help developers focus on actionable issues rather than noise.\nConsider implementing TeamCity’s integration features with development tools like IDEs, issue trackers, and deployment platforms. These integrations can significantly improve developer workflow efficiency when working with TeamCity builds.\nPhase 5: Full cutover\nGoal: Complete the migration by retiring Jenkins and ensuring all teams are successfully operating on TeamCity.\nKey question: Are you confident enough in your TeamCity implementation to retire Jenkins and scale this success to other teams?\nEstablish comprehensive monitoring for your TeamCity environment before retiring Jenkins. This includes system performance metrics, build success rates, and developer satisfaction indicators. You want to catch any issues quickly and have data to demonstrate migration success.\nOnce you’re ready, create a formal Jenkins retirement plan that includes data archival, access revocation, and infrastructure decommissioning. Ensure you maintain access to historical build data and artifacts as needed for compliance or debugging purposes.\nDocument migration outcomes and lessons learned. Consider creating case studies that demonstrate measurable improvements in build performance, developer productivity, and system maintainability. This documentation will be valuable for expanding TeamCity adoption to other teams and for ongoing system optimization.\nIt may also be worth establishing an internal guild focused on CI/CD best practices with TeamCity. This group can help new teams adopt the platform effectively and continue evolving your implementation based on emerging needs.\nExplaining the migration to management\nTechnical migrations often fail not because of technology issues but because of inadequate stakeholder communication and buy-in. Leadership needs to understand both the business case for migration and the risk-mitigation strategies that make it a safe investment.\nKey benefits for leadership\nPresent migration benefits in terms of business impact rather than technical features.\nLower CI/CD maintenance overhead translates to engineering time that can be redirected from infrastructure firefighting to product development. Quantify this where possible: If senior engineers currently spend 10 percent of their time managing Jenkins, that represents a significant opportunity cost.\nFaster builds and deployment cycles directly impact time to market and customer responsiveness. Demonstrate how TeamCity’s optimizations can reduce feedback loops and enable more frequent releases. This is particularly compelling for organizations pursuing competitive advantages through rapid innovation.\nBetter test insights and quality visibility reduce production incidents and customer-impacting defects. TeamCity’s flaky test detection and failure-analysis capabilities help teams identify quality issues before they reach customers, reducing support burden and protecting brand reputation.\nRisk-mitigation talking points\nAddress leadership concerns about migration risk directly and specifically.\nTeamCity supports parallel CI environments, which means you can validate the new system thoroughly without disrupting current operations. This isn’t a risky “big bang” migration that puts business continuity at stake.\nNo full cutover is required until teams are ready, which allows for controlled, incremental adoption. Teams can migrate when they have capacity and confidence rather than being forced into arbitrary timelines that create unnecessary stress and risk.\nThe phased rollout approach means early phases can be reversed easily if issues arise, while later phases build on proven success. This creates multiple decision points where leadership can evaluate progress and adjust strategy based on actual results rather than theoretical projections.\nBusiness-case template\nBelow is a template you can adapt for your organization’s specific situation and leadership communication style. You can find an editable copy of this template in the supporting files.\nProposal: TeamCity Migration to Reduce CI/CD Maintenance and Improve Development Velocity\nExecutive summary\nOur engineering team is requesting approval to migrate from Jenkins to TeamCity for our CI/CD infrastructure. This migration will reduce maintenance overhead currently consuming [X hours per week] of senior engineering time, improve build performance by an estimated [Y percent], and provide better visibility into code-quality issues before they reach production.\nCurrent challenges\nOur [your team name] team currently experiences [current pain point] with our Jenkins infrastructure. For example, [pipeline example] requires [specific maintenance burden or performance issue]. These issues are consuming approximately [time estimate] of engineering capacity that could be better spent on [strategic initiatives].\nProposed solution\nTeamCity offers a modern CI/CD platform with built-in capabilities that address our current pain points:\nReduced maintenance: The Kotlin DSL configuration eliminates plugin-compatibility issues and provides IDE support for pipeline development.\nImproved performance: Built-in test parallelization and intelligent caching can reduce build times by [estimated percentage].\nBetter quality insights: Automatic flaky test detection and comprehensive failure analysis help teams identify issues faster.\nRisk mitigation\nThis migration uses a proven, low-risk approach:\nParallel operation: TeamCity will run alongside Jenkins during transition, allowing immediate rollback if issues arise.\nIncremental adoption: We’ll migrate one pipeline at a time, starting with noncritical systems to validate the approach.\nPilot validation: Initial implementation will focus on [specific low-risk project] to prove value before broader adoption.\nSuccess metrics\nWe will measure migration success through these metrics:\nEngineering efficiency: Reduction in CI/CD maintenance time from [current] to [target].\nBuild performance: Average build-time improvement of [estimated percentage].\nQuality indicators: Faster identification of test issues and deployment problems.\nTimeline and investment\nPhase 1 (discovery): [timeframe] – current system audit and TeamCity environment setup.\nPhase 2 (pilot): [timeframe] – single project migration and validation.\nPhase 3 (rollout): [timeframe] – incremental migration based on pilot results.\nRecommendation\nWe recommend proceeding with Phase 1 (discovery) and a pilot implementation. This low-risk initial investment of [resource estimate] will provide concrete data about TeamCity’s benefits for our specific use cases and inform decisions about broader adoption.\nNext steps\nWith your approval, we will:\nConduct a comprehensive Jenkins environment audit.\nSet up a TeamCity evaluation environment.\nExecute pilot migration with [specific project].\nReport our results and recommendations for Phase 3.\nPlease let me know if you have questions about this proposal or would like additional details about any aspect of the migration plan.\nConclusion: Making migration a strategic success\nJenkins isn’t an inherently bad tool: It served the industry well during the early days of continuous integration and enabled countless teams to adopt automated build and deployment practices. However, like many tools from that era, Jenkins was designed for constraints and expectations that were different from what modern software development teams face today.\nIf your team is spending more time maintaining CI/CD infrastructure than building products, experiencing frequent pipeline-reliability issues, or lacking visibility into build and test performance, migration to a modern platform like TeamCity represents a strategic investment in developer productivity and system reliability.\nThe key to successful migration is approaching it as a systematic, risk-managed process rather than a disruptive technology replacement. With the right planning framework, you can migrate safely while improving your development workflows and team efficiency.\nStart with the migration-readiness checklist to perform an honest assessment of your current situation and organizational readiness. This self-evaluation will help you determine whether migration makes sense for your team and identify areas that need attention regardless of platform choice.\nExperiment with Kotlin DSL samples to understand how TeamCity’s approach differs from Jenkins and what benefits it offers for your specific use cases. The type safety and IDE support alone often convince teams that the learning investment is worthwhile.\nExecute a focused pilot project to validate TeamCity’s benefits in your environment with real workloads and development patterns. This proof-of-concept approach allows you to make data-driven decisions about broader adoption while building team confidence and expertise.\nTeamCity is a modern, scalable CI/CD platform that supports powerful pipeline authoring via Kotlin DSL, built-in test intelligence, and visual pipeline chains. Whether you’re a team of five or five hundred developers, TeamCity helps you ship software with confidence through better tooling, clearer visibility, and reduced maintenance overhead.\nThe migration frameworks and templates in this guide provide the structure you need to execute a successful transition. However, every organization’s situation is unique, so keep in mind that you’ll likely adapt these approaches based on your specific constraints and requirements.\nReady to explore how TeamCity can improve your development workflow?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Public school to PhD\nThe story of Airbnb’s Head Economist for Policy and Director of Data Science involves geology, co-teaching with a Nobel Prize winner, and CSI. (No, not the hit TV franchise.)\nPeter Coles was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He studied math at Princeton, earned his PhD in economics at Stanford, and taught at Harvard Business School before joining eBay and becoming a Data Science leader at Airbnb.\nAs you’ll see from his story, Peter has a deep interest in how marketplaces work. By transitioning from academia to the business world, he not only gets to study first-hand data about millions of guests and hosts, but also to influence product and policy decisions. And he still gets to hang out with academics. Check out all the research Peter and his team are doing here.\n\nMy fascination with marketplaces goes back a long time.\nSometime around second grade in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (where I grew up), my friends and I had the great idea to run a rock stand. It was like a lemonade stand, but instead we would sell rocks. Rocks we found in the street. Neighborhood kids could find their own rocks and sell them, and we’d take 25%. Nobody got any sales. Fortunately I’ve learned a bit more about marketplaces since then — more about that shortly.\nFrom kindergarten through high school, I was a public school kid. My parents valued education, and helping others — my father was a doctor, my mother a nutritionist — and those are values I still hold dear.\nWhile I played soccer and tennis and was moderately social, this period was probably best defined by an obsession with competitions. Math, Chess, Science Olympiad, Quiz Bowl, Academic Decathlon, puzzle races with my younger brother — there was hardly a nerdy competition offered where I didn’t compete. Time well spent? Let’s just say I missed a lot of high school parties while studying to become the five-time Wisconsin State Rocks, Minerals, and Fossil Identification champion — so you can be the judge.\nBy the time college came around, it seemed time to rebel. I wanted to be done with the nerdy stuff. I applied and was accepted to Princeton, and started studying ancient history. After one semester and (in my view) an underappreciated essay on the Hittites, I was back to majoring in math. At least I was good at that! I figured I could work on practical skills later.\nAfter graduating, I accepted a fellowship in Germany and continued to Stanford for a PhD in economics — a somewhat more applied science, though I focused on game theory, at the intersection of math and strategy. I had the good fortune there to be the second graduate student of Jon Levin, now the President of Stanford University, who taught me the importance of simplification in research — even when the subject matter itself is complex.\nEven while in this still-theoretical space, I kept my feet on the ground — or at least on the pedals. During a monthlong break in my classes in Germany, I biked around Europe, crashing with friends and family members of my classmates — people I had never met before staying with them. In a sense, I was prototyping Airbnb well before it existed!\nMy time in graduate school was Silicon Valley in the 2000s, after the dot-com crash, so tech was in the midst of a renaissance. Many of my friends were at growing companies like Google and Amazon. It was very tempting to stay in California to be a part of this, but I ended up with one more stop in academia.\nMarkets in theory, markets in practice\nHarvard Business School, known for its focus on managerial science, was perhaps the most compelling place in the academic world that would allow me to stay close to the tech industry. I got a double stroke of good fortune: not only was I offered an assistant professorship there, but I also got to co-teach with Al Roth, a founder of the field of Market Design. Al is still an important mentor to me, and later won a Nobel Prize!\nIn my time researching and teaching graduate students, I was exposed to many examples of market design, conducting research on the topic of “Matching”; that is, mechanisms to pair users from two groups, often when price cannot be used to clear the market. This covered strategy of participants, signaling in markets, and I even had a chance to improve the market for PhD economists. I also wrote a number of case studies, including on Zillow, Microsoft, Craigslist, and more. The teaching and writing was a lot of fun, but I also came to realize I wasn’t a fit for academia in the long term. My attention span was too short to dedicate most of my time to research papers (and especially peer reviews), but I was enormously appreciative of this phase of my career.\nBy this point it was 2013, and two simultaneous and interrelated phenomena were exploding in tech: mobile and the sharing economy. It was a perfect time to head back west and finally enter the tech world.\nI landed at eBay, which for a student of marketplaces was an ideal company: just about everything is for sale, and it was ripe for market design. Steve Tadelis, a mentor from my Stanford days, had created one of the first economics teams inside a tech company, which I took over when Steve left. At the same time, eBay was getting on the data science train — this was before every company had a DS team — and my group joined another to form eBay’s Data Labs. One of my favorite projects there was a project called “What’s it Worth” (which I worked on with Airbnb colleague Dean Chen), where we developed a methodology for determining the fair market value of items. Some hands-on practical work, some modeling — this was just what I was hoping for.\nIn 2015 Riley Newman, one of Airbnb’s first employees and then its Head of Data Science, presented an even more enticing opportunity. The Airbnb platform was growing quickly, and for the first time attracting substantial regulatory attention. They needed an economics team to partner with the growing policy team, to jointly address the question of Airbnb’s relationship to cities. This was a new way for me to apply economics. I was all in.\nAddressing Airbnb’s critical questions with data\nWhen I think back to my eight and a half years so far at Airbnb, I view this as entailing three “phases.” In the first, I worked to address economic questions by establishing a global team of data scientists and economists to analyze the relationship of short-term rentals to the world.\nMeanwhile, as Airbnb continued to grow, execs were asking big questions that couldn’t be answered by any specific data science team. They needed a group with visibility across the whole organization. So in this second phase, Jackson Wang and I founded a team called Central Strategy & Insights, or CSI.\nThe acronym was no coincidence: we saw ourselves as forensic investigators, piecing together stories as we collected evidence. One important period of CSI’s work addressed changes brought on by the pandemic — in particular a major adjustment in where guests were looking to stay, and the supply we’d need to accommodate them. We also led the company’s business reviews, and generated analyses to describe the business to shareholders ahead of the IPO.\nMy third phase at Airbnb started a lot like the first, but supersized: developing models to inform a well-considered approach to policy considerations, this time as travel rebounded after the pandemic and governments were no longer fully occupied with a public health emergency. Our newly expanded group of economics PhDs and analysts also came up with ways to evaluate Airbnb’s impact on guests, hosts, and society, including via our US Economic Impact Report.\nA great balance of academic and applied science\nAlmost all of my first several years at Airbnb had been internally facing. That’s changed in recent times, as we’ve spun up and expanded a program to collaborate with academic researchers to analyze Airbnb’s data and improve the experience for users.\nThe first step was to figure out how to collaborate with external researchers, while respecting privacy and legal limitations. Collaboration interest then came quickly. We have now published well-received papers with professors from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, UCLA, NYU and more, with others in progress. One paper I wrote with colleagues and academic partners develops foundations for what “quality” means in platforms, from an economic perspective.\nWe’ve also launched a monthly seminar where we invite our academic collaborators to discuss research with Airbnb data scientists and technologists. Developing research is great, but there’s nothing like live discussions to cross-pollinate and foster ideas. This builds on a strong collaborative learning tradition at Airbnb, with internal classes and reading groups to grow our skills and keep up with tech developments.\nAlongside engaging with academia, I’m so excited my data science colleagues and I have a mandate to be innovative and proactive. We have the space and encouragement to work on big ideas, even if they might take a year or two to prove out — and perhaps more importantly, even if some of the ideas fail. But nothing is more important than the people. I am proud of the students, scientists, and even professors I have hired here over the years, and love seeing them grow and find success.\nA license to tackle big topics, continual education, research on the product as well as its relationship to the outside world, amazing colleagues, and a direct connection to academia all make Airbnb a unique place to be a market designer, economist, and data scientist. Whether or not you spent your free time in eighth grade studying rocks.\nIf you want to learn more about the research happening at Airbnb you can read our published papers here. If this type of work interests you, check out our open roles.\n\nMy Journey to Airbnb: Peter Coles was originally published in The Airbnb Tech Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "전편에서 제안한 원칙들을 어떻게 팀 프로젝트에 적용하는지에 대해 Claude Code Plugin / Skills / Hooks를 이용하여 구체적인 예시를 살펴본다.\n케이스: LLM의 작업 진행사항을 이슈 트래커와 동기화하기\n언젠가 AI의 개발 산출물이 인간의 수준을 아득히 뛰어넘는 날이 오면 더 이상 작업 이력을 추적할 필요가 없어지는 시점이 올지도 모른다.\n하지만 인간지능과 인공지능이 공동의 산출물을 함께 작업하는 현시점에서는 기존의 방식대로 작업 계획을 수립하고, 이력을 추적하는 방식이 아직까지는 유효하다. 다만, 기존의 협업 방식이 코딩에이전트의 신속한 작업흐름의 병목이 될 소지가 있으므로 인간과 AI가 조화롭게 협업할 수 있는 방안을 모색해야 한다.\n이 글에서는 기존 작업 이력 추적 방식을 유지하면서도 코딩 에이전트의 병목을 최소화하는 방법을 Claude Code의 Plugin, Skills, Hooks 활용한 예제를 통해 살펴본다.\n기존 SW 개발 방식.\n일감 등록 → 공유/회의 → 업무 배분 → 개발\n일반적인 소프트웨어 개발에서 협업은 업무 관계자 간 공유를 전제로 한다. 온/오프라인에서 컨텍스트를 공유, 업무 이해를 바탕으로 일감을 배분한다.\n커뮤니케이션은 코스트가 큰 작업이지만 업무의 시작점과 범위를 명확히 하고 팀 전체의 추적성을 높이기 위해 필수적이다.\n그래서 협업 문화가 고도화된 조직에서는 비동기적으로 컨텍스트를 공유, 커뮤니케이션 비용을 최소화한다.\n코딩 에이전트와의 SW 개발 방식.\n목적 공유 → 스펙 구체화 → 구현 계획 수립 → 개발\n반면 코딩 에이전트와의 개발은 Local Session 내에서 독자적으로 이뤄진다. 개발자는 에이전트에게 목적을 전달하고, 대화를 통해 스펙을 구체화하며, 구현 계획을 수립한 뒤 바로 개발에 들어간다. 기존 협업 방식에서 팀 회의나 이슈 트래커가 담당하던 기획과 계획 수립이, 개발자와 에이전트 사이의 로컬 세션으로 대체된다.\n문제는 이 과정이 외부로 공유되지 않는다는 것이다. “왜 이런 설계를 선택했는지”, “어떤 대안을 검토했는지”, “구현 중 어떤 제약을 만났는지” 등등의 모든 컨텍스트가 대화창 안에만 존재한다. 세션이 종료되면 컨텍스트는 휘발되며 다른 팀원은 최종 결과물만 볼 수 있을 뿐, 결과물에 이르기까지의 의사결정 과정은 알 수 없다.\n협업과 지속 가능성이 없는 프로젝트라면 컨텍스트의 공유는 불필요하기에 별 문제가 되지 않을 것이다. 하지만 지속적인 유지보수와 개선이 필요한 팀 프로젝트라면 과정의 가시성을 갖추어야 한다.\n두 방식의 충돌\n협업 문화가 고도화되지 않은 조직의 워크플로우에 코딩 에이전트를 도입한다면 AI의 압도적인 구현 속도를 프로세스가 따라가지 못할 것이다. 일감등록, 업무배분, 회의 등 모든 단계가 병목이 된다.\n반면, 코딩 에이전트와의 개발 방식대로 Local Session 내에서 모든 작업을 계획하고 처리, 결과물만 공유하도록 내버려둔다면 팀단위의 의사결정을 파편화된 Local Session 들에게 위탁하는 결과를 낳게 될 것이다.\n해결책 모색: 이슈 트래커-코딩 에이전트 동기화\n워크플로우 개선에 앞서 가장 먼저 할 일은 협업 문화를 비동기적으로 개선하는 것이다.\nGitHub Engineering의 비동기 커뮤니케이션 원칙처럼, 문서와 이슈 기반으로 의사결정이 이루어지는 문화가 전제되어야 한다. 정례적, 정기적으로 열리는 회의에서 상정되는 아이템이 일감이 되는 워크플로우는 코딩에이전트의 역량에 병목이 된다.\n비동기 협업 문화가 갖춰졌다면, 다음 단계는 로컬 세션에 갇힌 코딩 에이전트의 작업 이력을 이 흐름에 자연스럽게 합류시키는 것이다.\nLinear 이슈 트래커\n이 글에서는 이슈 트래커로 Linear를 사용한다. Linear를 선택한 이유는 Opinionated issue tracker이기 때문이다. Opinionated software란 특정 use case에 맞게 purpose-built된 소프트웨어를 의미한다. Linear의 공동창업자 Jori Lallo는 Figma 블로그 인터뷰에서 이렇게 설명한다:\n“We design it so that there’s one really good way of doing things. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.”\n자유도가 높은 도구는 모든 사람이 각자의 워크플로우를 만들어내고, 팀이 커질수록 혼란이 가중된다. Linear는 이슈 상태, 워크플로우, 브랜치 네이밍(gitBranchName), GitHub 연동 방식이 사전 정의되어 있고, 사용자가 이 흐름을 따르도록 유도한다. 이런 설계는 코딩 에이전트와의 통합에 유리하다. 워크플로우가 명확하게 정의되어 있으면, 에이전트에게 “Linear 방식대로 해”라고 지시하는 것만으로 일관된 결과를 기대할 수 있다. 선택지가 많으면 에이전트도 혼란스럽다.\nGitHub-Linear Integration\nLinear와 GitHub 연동은 물 흐르듯 매끄럽다. 몇 가지 규칙만 따르면 별도의 작업 없이 자동으로 동기화된다. GitHub + Linear integration을 설정하면 PR 자동 연결과 머지 시 이슈 상태 동기화가 활성화된다.\n이슈 ID 기반 브랜치 생성\n\nLinear 이슈 화면에서 Copy git branch name 액션을 쓰면, username + issue ID + title 처럼 Linear – GitHub 간 연동을 위한 ID 정보를 포함한 브랜치 이름을 바로 만들어 GitHub에서 쓸 수 있다. 이 포맷은 GitHub 인테그레이션 설정에서 팀 규칙에 맞게 변경 가능하다.\nPR 관리 (이슈  PR 자동 링크)\n\n브랜치 이름이나 PR 제목에 이슈 ID를 포함하면 PR 생성 시 자동으로 Linear 이슈와 연결되고, PR 본문/커밋 메시지에 Fixes ENG-123 같은 “magic word + 이슈 ID”를 쓰면 여러 PR·커밋을 하나의 이슈에 링크할 수 있다.\nMagic Words\n\nPR 본문이나 커밋 메시지에 Fixes ENG-123 같은 형식으로 이슈 ID 앞에 Fixes, Closes, Resolves 같은 magic word를 쓰면 해당 PR/커밋이 머지될 때 Linear 이슈가 자동으로 Done 상태로 변경된다. 여러 이슈를 한꺼번에 닫을 수도 있다.분류Magic words (대소문자 무시)Linear에서의 효과사용처예시Closing (머지 후 Issue 자동 완료)close, closes, closed, closing, fix, fixes, fixed, fixing, resolve, resolves, resolved, resolving, complete, completes, completed, completingPR/MR 머지 시 ‘Done’으로 이슈 상태 변경PR/MR descriptionFixes ENG-123Non-closing / Contributing (참조 링크)ref, references, part of, related to, contributes to, towards머지 후에도 이슈 상태 변경 안됨PR/MR descriptionRelated to ENG-123\n이슈 상태 자동 관리\n\nGitHub PR이 draft → open → merged 로 이동할 때, 팀별 워크플로 설정에 따라 Linear 이슈 상태를 In Progress / Done 등으로 자동으로 옮길 수 있다. PR revert 시 이슈를 다시 여는 동작도 지원한다.\nGitHub Issues 동기화(선택)\n\n필요하면 특정 리포지토리의 GitHub Issues를 Linear 팀과 연결해, 새로 생성되는 이슈의 제목·설명·상태·라벨·assignee·댓글 등을 양방향으로 동기화할 수 있다.\n시도 1: linear mcp를 이용한 이슈 트래커 동기화\nMCP(Model Context Protocol)는 “로컬 세션에서 만든 계획을 Linear에 바로 반영”하는 가장 직관적인 방법이다. 개발자는 Claude Code와 대화하며 구현 계획(체크리스트/작업 단위)을 만들고, 그 내용을 바탕으로 Linear MCP(Multi-Client/Model Context Protocol) 툴 호출을 명시적으로 지시해서 이슈를 생성/갱신한다.\n진행 흐름\n1) 목적/스펙 합의: Claude Code와 대화로 요구사항과 범위를 정리한다.\n2) 구현 계획 작성: 구현 계획을 TODO/체크리스트 형태로 만든다.\n3) Linear 이슈 반영(수동 트리거): linear mcp를 이용하여 지금까지의 구현 계획을 바탕으로 Linear에 이슈를 만들고 업데이트할 것을 지시한다.\n4) 개발 진행 중 동기화(반복): 진행 상황이 바뀔 때마다(작업 착수/PR 생성/막힌 점 발생/완료) 다시 MCP 호출을 시켜 상태/코멘트/체크리스트를 업데이트한다.\nLinear MCP 사용례\nMCP 사용법은 어렵지 않다. 아래와 같이 “어떤 이슈를 어떤 내용으로 만들지/바꿀지”를 구체적으로 기술하여 Tool call을 유도하면 된다.\n이슈 생성: 제목/설명/우선순위/라벨/담당자/팀/프로젝트 등을 포함해 생성\n이슈 업데이트: 상태(In Progress/Done), 설명(계획 상세), 코멘트(결정사항/제약/진행상황) 등을 갱신\n이슈 생성 예시\n지금까지 정리한 구현 계획을 Linear에 반영해줘.\n- 팀: ENG\n- 프로젝트: Agent Workflow\n- 이슈 제목: \"Claude Code Hooks로 Linear 동기화 자동화\"\n- 설명에는 아래 계획을 체크리스트로 포함\n- 우선순위 P2, 라벨: agenticai, tooling\n\n\n\n\n이슈 업데이트 예시\n방금 PR을 만들었어. Linear 이슈에 PR 링크를 코멘트로 남기고 상태를 In Progress로 바꿔줘.\n그리고 문제점(권한 이슈)을 'Blocker' 코멘트로 기록해줘.\n\n\n\n\n이 방식의 문제는 대화를 통해 명시적으로 이슈트래커 동기화 지시를 해야만 한다는 점이다. 개발자는 매 변경점 마다 이슈를 갱신하기 위해 코딩 에이전트와 대화를 해야 한다.\n문제점\n작업 병목: 계획을 세우는 흐름과, Linear에 반영하는 흐름이 분리되어 있어 매 작업마다 “등록/업데이트” 지시가 요구된다.\n누락 가능성: 깜박하고 작업 내역을 동기화하지 않는 등 인간의 실수 개입 여지가 있다.\n일관성 부족: 코딩 에이전트와 대화를 통해 이슈 본문/제목/prefix 등을 기술하다 보면 일관성을 보장하기 어렵게 된다.\n시도 2: CLAUDE.md 및 Sub-Agent 를 이용한 이슈 트래커 동기화 자동화\n이번에는 매번 Linear 업데이트를 지시하는 대신, 계획 단계에서 정리한 내용을 자동으로 등록/업데이트하도록 CLAUDE.md에 규칙을 기술한다.\nCLAUDE.md: 구현 전에 반드시 이슈 트래커를 업데이트하도록 명시하는 규칙 문서\nSub-Agent: 이슈 작성 형식과 예제를 프롬프트에 고정해, 항상 같은 템플릿으로 작성하게 하는 전담 에이전트\n진행 흐름\n1) CLAUDE.md에 동기화 규칙 명시: 구현에 들어가기 전에, 계획 내용을 이슈 트래커에 등록/업데이트하도록 규칙을 박아둔다.\n2) Sub-Agent에 작성 형식 기술: 제목 규칙, 본문 섹션, 라벨/우선순위 등을 Sub-Agent 프롬프트로 템플릿 화한다.\n3) 계획 수립: Claude Code와 대화로 스펙을 구체화하고 구현 계획을 체크리스트로 정리한다.\n4) 구현: CLAUDE.md에 명시된 규칙에 따라 구현에 들어가기 전 이슈트래커에 계획과 진행사항을 갱신한다.\n사용례\nCLAUDE.md 예시\n# CLAUDE.md\n\n## Issue Tracker Sync\n- 계획이 확정되면 항상 \"구현 계획\"을 체크리스트로 만든다.\n- 구현을 시작하기 전에는 항상 구현 계획을 기반으로 Linear 이슈를 생성한다.\n\n\n\n\nSub-Agent 예시\n[You are Issue Tracker Agent]\n- Convert the current plan into a Linear issue update.\n- Title rule: <PREFIX>: <verb> <object>\n- Body sections: Background / Decisions / Alternatives / Checklist\n- Default labels: agenticai, tooling\n- Default priority: P2\n\n\n\n\n문제점\n누락: CLAUDE.md에 규칙을 명시해도, 그 내용이 반드시 실행됨을 보장하지는 않는다. 대화 흐름이 길어지거나 컨텍스트가 여러 번 바뀌면, 계획 → 구현 전환 시점에서 동기화 스텝이 건너뛰어질 수 있다.\n진행사항 반영: CLAUDE.md 만으로는 구현 도중에 발생하는 모든 이력을 이슈 트래커에 반영하도록 제어하기 어렵다. 마찬가지로 누락이 발생한다.\n유연성 부족: 이미 논의된 이슈를 구현하거나, 존재하는 브랜치를 체크아웃 하는 등의 유연성을 워크플로우에 반영하기 어렵다.\nClaude Code Hooks\n위와 같이 특정 작업에 대해 반드시 실행을 보장해야 하는 경우, Claude Code의 Hooks 기능이 해결책이 될 수 있다.\nHook은 Claude Code의 특정 생명주기 이벤트에서 자동으로 실행되는 사용자 정의 셸 명령이다. 대화형으로 LLM에게 요청하거나 사전에 프롬프트로 기재하여 지시하는 방식과는 달리, Hook은 특정 상황에서 특정 동작을 강제할 수 있다.\n다시 말해 Hook은 반드시 실행된다.\n이벤트 발생 → Hook 트리거 → 스크립트 실행 → Exit Code에 따라 진행/차단\nHook은 다음과 같은 문제들을 해결할 수 있다.\n1. 반복 작업 자동화: 파일 수정 후 진행사항 요약, 구현 전에 이슈 및 브랜치 생성 등\n2. 프로젝트 규칙 강제: 특정 명령 차단, 파일 경로 검증, 네이밍 컨벤션 준수\n3. 컨텍스트 자동 주입: 세션 시작 사전에 체크리스트 로드\n예를 들어 PreToolUse 이벤트에 Write|Edit matcher를 설정하면 Claude가 파일을 수정하려 할 때마다 스크립트가 실행된다. 또한 PreCompact 이벤트를 활용하면 컨텍스트 윈도우가 압축되기 전에 현재까지의 작업 내용을 Linear 이슈에 코멘트로 남길 수 있다.\nClaude Code Hook 이벤트 종류\n\n이벤트발생 시점matcher 지원주요 용도\n\nUserPromptSubmit사용자 프롬프트 제출 직후, Claude 처리 전X프롬프트 검증, 컨텍스트 주입, 보안 필터링\nPreToolUse도구 파라미터 생성 후, 실행 전O특정 명령 차단, 민감 파일 보호, 입력 수정\nPermissionRequest권한 다이얼로그 표시 시O특정 도구 자동 승인/거부\nPostToolUse도구 실행 성공 직후O자동 포매팅, 로깅, 결과 검증\nStop메인 에이전트 응답 완료 시X품질 게이트 (lint, test), 작업 완료 검증\nSubagentStop서브에이전트 작업 완료 시X서브태스크 완료 검증, 추가 작업 강제\nPreCompact컨텍스트 윈도우 압축 전X트랜스크립트 백업, 진행 상황 저장\nSessionStart세션 시작 또는 재개 시X개발 컨텍스트 로드, 환경 초기화\nSessionEnd세션 종료 시X정리 작업, 세션 통계 로깅\nNotificationClaude Code가 알림 전송 시O데스크톱 알림, 사운드 재생\n\n\n\n\n\n이때 실행된 스크립트에서 반환하는 Exit Code에 따라 이후 진행을 제어할 수 있다.\n예를 들어 main 브랜치에서 직접 파일을 수정하려는 시도를 감지하면 스크립트가 exit 2를 반환하고, stderr에 “main 브랜치에서는 직접 수정할 수 없습니다. Linear 이슈를 생성하고 feature 브랜치를 만드세요.”라는 메시지를 출력한다.\n이 메시지는 Claude에게 전달되어, Claude가 스스로 Linear 이슈 생성 → 브랜치 생성 → 체크아웃 순서로 작업을 수정하게 된다.\nExit Code에 따른 흐름 제어\n\nExit Code의미Claude에게 전달동작\n\n0성공stdout (JSON)정상 진행.

분명 중요하고 흥미로운 글인데, 몇 문단 읽기도 전에 스크롤을 내리거나 다른 탭으로 넘어가 버리는 경험 말이에요. 텍스트가 조금만 어려워져도 금세 집중력을 잃고, 결국엔 &ldquo;다 읽긴 읽었는데&hellip; 뭘 읽었지?&rdquo; 하는 허무함에 사로잡히곤 하죠. 솔직히 말씀드리면,&nbsp; 저는 이런 현상이 점점 더 심해지는 것 같다고 느껴요. 긴 에세이, 깊이 있는 보도 자료, 연구 기반의 글들을 마치 SNS 피드처럼 쓱 훑어보고 넘기는 습관이 우리에게 너무나도 익숙해져 버린 거죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저 역시 다르지 않았습니다. 수많은 글들을 북마크에 쌓아두고 &ldquo;나중에 읽어야지&rdquo; 하면서도, 결국엔 제대로 소화하지 못하는 날들이 이어졌죠. 그러다 문득 깨달았어요. 익숙함이 곧 이해는 아니라는 사실을요. 단순히 읽는 행위를 넘어, 진정으로 내용을 내 것으로 만들고 싶다는 갈증이 커졌습니다. 처음에는 더 좋은 노트 필기법을 찾아 헤맸고, 다음에는 구글 NotebookLM이라는 도구를 만났습니다. 그리고 이 도구를 &lsquo;느린 읽기&rsquo;의 강력한 동반자로 활용하기 시작했죠. 이미 수많은 글들을 NotebookLM으로 처리하고 있었기에, 이걸 장문 글에 적용하는 것은 저에게 아주 자연스러운 실험이자 전환점이었습니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  집중력 저하 시대, 왜 &lsquo;느린 읽기&rsquo;가 필요한가요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">생각해 보면, 현대 사회는 우리에게 끊임없이 '빠르게'를 요구합니다. 정보의 양은 폭발적으로 증가하고, 우리는 그 속도에 발맞추지 못하면 뒤처질 것 같은 불안감에 시달리죠. 하지만 정말 역설적으로, 이럴 때일수록 '느리게' 읽는 습관이 더욱 중요해진다고 저는 생각합니다. 빠르게 훑고 지나가버리는 것은 결코 진정한 학습이나 사고의 확장을 가져다주지 못해요. 오히려 미묘한 맥락, 숨겨진 전제, 그리고 깊은 통찰을 놓치게 만들 뿐입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">느린 읽기는 단순히 속도를 늦추는 것을 넘어선, 하나의 <b>사고방식의 전환</b>입니다. 텍스트와 진정으로 대화하고, 저자의 의도를 파고들며, 나아가 나 자신만의 관점을 형성하는 과정이죠. 이 과정에서 필요한 것이 바로 '인내심'입니다. 그런데 이 인내심, 혼자서 기르기 정말 어렵지 않나요?

        "contentSnippet": "넘쳐나는 정보의 홍수 속에서 우리는 점점 더 짧은 집중력을 갖게 됩니다. 길고 복잡한 글 앞에서 쉽게 좌절하고, 피상적인 이해에 만족하곤 하죠. 이제는 달라져야 합니다. 이 글은 구글 NotebookLM을 활용해 '느린 읽기' 습관을 되찾고, 정보의 깊이를 완전히 내 것으로 만드는 혁신적인 방법을 제안합니다. 단순한 요약을 넘어, 진정한 사고의 파트너로서 NotebookLM이 여러분의 지적 성장에 어떻게 기여하는지 함께 탐구해 보세요.\n\n\n혹시 이런 경험 없으신가요? 분명 중요하고 흥미로운 글인데, 몇 문단 읽기도 전에 스크롤을 내리거나 다른 탭으로 넘어가 버리는 경험 말이에요. 텍스트가 조금만 어려워져도 금세 집중력을 잃고, 결국엔 “다 읽긴 읽었는데… 뭘 읽었지?” 하는 허무함에 사로잡히곤 하죠. 솔직히 말씀드리면,  저는 이런 현상이 점점 더 심해지는 것 같다고 느껴요. 긴 에세이, 깊이 있는 보도 자료, 연구 기반의 글들을 마치 SNS 피드처럼 쓱 훑어보고 넘기는 습관이 우리에게 너무나도 익숙해져 버린 거죠.\n저 역시 다르지 않았습니다. 수많은 글들을 북마크에 쌓아두고 “나중에 읽어야지” 하면서도, 결국엔 제대로 소화하지 못하는 날들이 이어졌죠. 그러다 문득 깨달았어요. 익숙함이 곧 이해는 아니라는 사실을요. 단순히 읽는 행위를 넘어, 진정으로 내용을 내 것으로 만들고 싶다는 갈증이 커졌습니다. 처음에는 더 좋은 노트 필기법을 찾아 헤맸고, 다음에는 구글 NotebookLM이라는 도구를 만났습니다. 그리고 이 도구를 ‘느린 읽기’의 강력한 동반자로 활용하기 시작했죠. 이미 수많은 글들을 NotebookLM으로 처리하고 있었기에, 이걸 장문 글에 적용하는 것은 저에게 아주 자연스러운 실험이자 전환점이었습니다.\n  집중력 저하 시대, 왜 ‘느린 읽기’가 필요한가요?\n생각해 보면, 현대 사회는 우리에게 끊임없이 '빠르게'를 요구합니다. 정보의 양은 폭발적으로 증가하고, 우리는 그 속도에 발맞추지 못하면 뒤처질 것 같은 불안감에 시달리죠. 하지만 정말 역설적으로, 이럴 때일수록 '느리게' 읽는 습관이 더욱 중요해진다고 저는 생각합니다. 빠르게 훑고 지나가버리는 것은 결코 진정한 학습이나 사고의 확장을 가져다주지 못해요. 오히려 미묘한 맥락, 숨겨진 전제, 그리고 깊은 통찰을 놓치게 만들 뿐입니다.\n느린 읽기는 단순히 속도를 늦추는 것을 넘어선, 하나의 사고방식의 전환입니다. 텍스트와 진정으로 대화하고, 저자의 의도를 파고들며, 나아가 나 자신만의 관점을 형성하는 과정이죠. 이 과정에서 필요한 것이 바로 '인내심'입니다. 그런데 이 인내심, 혼자서 기르기 정말 어렵지 않나요? 그래서 저는 NotebookLM을 활용해 이 여정을 함께할 파트너를 만들기로 했습니다.\n  NotebookLM, 요약 도구를 넘어선 ‘사고의 동반자’로\n  요약 기계에서 벗어나 깊이 있는 이해로\n많은 분들이 NotebookLM을 ‘빠르게 답을 얻기 위한 요약 도구’로 활용하실 거예요. 문서를 업로드하고, 요약을 요청한 다음, 핵심만 쓱 훑어보는 방식 말이죠. 물론 이런 활용법도 유용하지만, 솔직히 이건 우리가 다른 콘텐츠를 소비하는 성급한 방식과 크게 다르지 않다고 봅니다. 저 역시 그랬고요. 그러다 어느 순간, 이렇게 얻은 지식은 뇌리에 오래 남지 않는다는 좌절감을 느끼기 시작했습니다. 이 경험이 저를 변화시켰어요.\n저는 NotebookLM에 전체 문서를 요약해 달라는 요청을 멈췄습니다. 대신, 제가 인내심을 가지고 장문의 글을 읽는 동안 함께 걸어가는 ‘읽기 파트너’로 대하기 시작했죠. 지름길을 찾는 대신, 목적지에 도달하는 여정 자체를 중요하게 여기는 방식으로요. 목표는 더 이상 속도가 아니었습니다. 요약 과정에서 사라질 수 있는 모든 미묘한 뉘앙스, 숨겨진 의미까지 완벽하게 이해할 만큼 충분히 콘텐츠와 함께 머무는 것. 그것이 저의 새로운 목표가 되었어요.\n\n\n  텍스트 중심 접근: 하나의 글로 하나의 노트를!\n이러한 새로운 읽기 및 학습 시스템을 구축하기 위해, 저는 길거나 까다로운 텍스트 하나당 별도의 NotebookLM 노트북을 하나씩 만들어요. 예를 들어, 경제학 논문 하나를 읽을 때 그 논문만을 위한 노트북을 따로 만드는 식이죠. 이 ‘단일 텍스트 중심 접근’은 생각보다 훨씬 중요합니다. 왜냐하면 이렇게 해야만 글의 맥락을 온전히 유지할 수 있고, 아직 충분히 이해되지 않은 아이디어가 마구잡이로 섞여 혼란이 가중되는 것을 막을 수 있거든요. 하나의 기사나 PDF가 NotebookLM에서 저의 연구와 학습을 위한 지식 기반을 구축하는 출발점이 되는 셈이죠.\n⚙️ 느린 읽기를 강제하는 나만의 맞춤 지침\n제가 NotebookLM을 ‘느린 읽기 파트너’로 활용할 수 있었던 핵심적인 이유 중 하나는 바로 간단한 ‘사용자 지정 지침(Custom Instruction)’ 덕분입니다. NotebookLM의 ‘Configure notebook > Custom’ 메뉴에서 자신만의 지침을 입력할 수 있는데, 제 설정은 대략 이렇습니다.\n\n\n  나만의 NotebookLM 맞춤 지침 예시\n너는 나의 느린 읽기 파트너다. 내가 명시적으로 요청하지 않는 한, 전체 섹션을 요약하지 말 것.\n내가 문단을 붙여넣으면, 그것을 신중하게 바꿔 말해 주고, 전제(assumptions)를 드러내며, 모호한 부분을 강조해 달라.\n결론보다 질문을 우선해 달라.\n이 단 한 가지 지침이 NotebookLM과의 모든 대화 톤을 완전히 바꿔 놓았어요. 때로는 NotebookLM의 속도를 늦추는 ‘과속 방지턱’처럼 작동해서, 제가 텍스트에 더 오래 머물게 해 줍니다. NotebookLM은 제가 잠시 멈춰 서서, 글이 던지는 질문들을 깊이 곱씹어 보도록 만들어요. 덕분에 저는 피상적인 이해를 넘어, 글의 심층적인 구조와 의미를 탐구할 수 있게 됩니다.\n  한 문단씩 뜯어보기: ‘혼란’을 ‘진전’으로 만드는 비법\n✍️ 지름길을 거부하는 탐구적 프롬프트 활용\n첫 번째 읽기에서는 NotebookLM이 제안하는 질문들을 활용해 전체적인 맥락을 한번 훑어봅니다. 중요한 것은 두 번째 읽기부터예요. 정말 복잡하고 어려운 글을 만났을 때, 저는 주요 출처를 선택 해제한 상태에서 한 문단 또는 몇 개의 문단만 NotebookLM에 붙여넣습니다. 이처럼 제한적으로 접근하는 것은 의도적인 전략입니다. 어려운 글은 종종 몇 문장 안에 여러 아이디어를 압축해 담고 있는데, 우리가 너무 빠르게 읽으면 피상적인 해석에 머물러 핵심을 놓치기 쉽거든요. 한 문단씩 천천히 읽으면 자연스럽게 속도가 느려질 수밖에 없습니다.\nNotebookLM의 기본 질문을 그대로 사용하는 대신, 저는 저만의 ‘후속 탐구 질문’을 던집니다. 예를 들어, 이런 식이죠.\n이 문단의 복잡성을 알아차리도록 신중한 독자를 강제로 느리게 만들 다섯 가지 탐구 질문을 생성해 달라.\n이 문단은 독자나 더 넓은 맥락에 대해 어떤 전제를 깔고 있는가?\n이 논증의 어느 부분이 앞선 텍스트의 섹션들에 가장 크게 의존하는가?\n이 문단은 훑어읽을 경우 어떻게 오해될 수 있는가?\n사려 깊은 비평가는 여기서 무엇을 문제 삼을까?\n이러한 프롬프트들은 제 이해의 엄청난 공백을 여과 없이 드러냅니다. 그런데 이게 바로 목적이에요! 질문과 함께 다시 읽을 때, 혼란은 더 이상 실패처럼 느껴지지 않고, 오히려 진정한 진전처럼 느껴지기 시작합니다. 시간이 지나면서 저는 미묘하지만 중요한 변화를 알아차렸어요. 한 문단을 세 번째로 읽을 때는 더 이상 단순히 ‘저자가 무엇을 말하는가?’를 묻지 않고, ‘왜 이런 방식으로 말했는가?’라는 관점에 초점을 맞추게 된다는 점이죠. 저자의 의도와 배경까지 파고드는 겁니다.\n\n\n\n\n\n구분\n빠른 훑어읽기 (Superficial Reading)\nNotebookLM 활용 느린 읽기 (Deep Reading)\n\n\n\n\n목표\n정보의 핵심 파악, 빠른 소비\n맥락, 뉘앙스, 저자의 의도 심층 이해\n\n\n활용 방식\n요약 기능 위주, 자동 질문 활용\n문단별 탐구 프롬프트, 맞춤 지침\n\n\n결과\n피상적인 이해, 빠른 망각\n깊이 있는 지식 축적, 비판적 사고력 증진\n\n\n\n✅ 능동적 마이크로 드릴: 이해를 위한 작은 근육 운동\n  수동적 노트 대신 짧고 집중적인 연습으로\n전통적인 노트 필기 방식, 특히 복잡한 자료 앞에서는 한계를 드러내는 경우가 많습니다. 하이라이트를 아무리 쳐도 쌓이기만 할 뿐, 실제 이해로 이어지지 않는 경우가 허다하죠. 요약 역시 뉘앙스를 죽이고 핵심을 뭉뚱그려 버리기 일쑤고요. 더 나쁜 것은, 단순히 읽거나 훑어보는 것만으로도 ‘내가 이해하고 있다’는 착각에 빠지기 쉽다는 점입니다. 저는 이런 함정을 피하기 위해 새로운 방법을 찾았습니다.\n저는 각 주요 섹션을 읽고 난 뒤, NotebookLM에게 작고 표적화된 ‘마이크로 드릴(Micro Drill)’을 생성해 달라고 요청합니다. 이것들은 전통적인 의미의 학습 보조 도구라기보다는, NotebookLM의 강력한 학습 기능을 활용해 저의 약한 이해 포인트를 초기에 드러내는 역할을 해요. 제가 자주 사용하는 프롬프트는 다음과 같습니다.\n이 논증을 정말로 이해했는지 확인하는 세 문항 퀴즈를 생성해 달라.\n이 섹션을 주장과 이유를 연결하는 “왜–왜냐하면” 사슬로 바꿔 달라.\n하나의 전제가 제거되면 이 섹션에서 어떤 아이디어가 무너질까?\n이 마이크로 드릴들이 정말 효과적인 이유는 그 ‘범위’에 있습니다. 즉시 완료할 수 있을 만큼 짧지만, 동시에 제 이해의 공백을 명확히 드러낼 만큼 충분히 까다롭죠. 만약 막히는 지점이 생긴다면, 저는 억지로 앞으로 밀고 나가지 않습니다. 대신, 마찰을 일으킨 바로 그 문단으로 돌아가 다시 읽으며 문제의 핵심을 파고들어요.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n막히는 부분이 생겼을 때 절대 서둘러 넘어가거나 ‘이해한 척’하지 마세요. 그 부분이 바로 여러분의 깊은 이해를 방해하는 지점입니다. 다시 돌아가 꼼꼼히 확인하고 질문하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요해요.\n제가 직접 만든 퀴즈 프롬프트는 NotebookLM의 기본 퀴즈나 플래시카드 도구와는 다른 결과물을 내놓습니다. 물론 NotebookLM의 기본 도구들도 글 전체를 다 읽은 뒤 최종 점검용으로 사용하기에 가치가 있지만, 제가 만든 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 제 이해도를 점검하고 사고를 강제하는 상호작용형 테스트에 가깝습니다. 덕분에 저는 훨씬 더 능동적으로 텍스트와 씨름하며 지식을 쌓아갈 수 있게 되었어요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. NotebookLM을 요약 도구가 아닌 '느린 읽기 파트너'로 인식하고, 질문을 우선시하는 맞춤 지침을 설정하세요.\n2. 복잡한 텍스트는 한 문단씩 집중적으로 읽으며, 지름길 프롬프트를 통해 저자의 숨겨진 전제와 미묘한 뉘앙스를 파악하세요.\n3. 각 섹션 뒤에 짧은 '마이크로 드릴'을 활용해 능동적으로 이해도를 점검하고, 약한 부분을 즉시 보완하세요.\n4. 결정적인 요소는 '인내심'! 작은 단위로 시작하여 점진적으로 느린 읽기 습관을 길러나가세요.\n이러한 전략을 통해 NotebookLM은 단순한 정보 처리 도구를 넘어, 여러분의 사고를 심화시키고 진정한 지식 습득을 돕는 강력한 조력자가 될 것입니다.\n✨ 느린 읽기는 하루하루 다시 길러갈 수 있는 기술\n이런 방식으로 NotebookLM을 활용한다고 해서 글을 더 빨리 끝내게 된 것은 아닙니다. 아니, 정확히 말하면, 더 빨리 끝내기보다는 글 속으로 다시 돌아오게 만드는 힘을 얻었습니다. 유튜브 긴 재생목록으로 학습할 때도 비슷한 접근법을 사용하고 있는데, 확실히 이해도가 남달라요. 속도를 늦추고, 범위를 제한하며, 더 나은 질문을 끊임없이 던지면, 다시 읽는 행위 자체가 호기심을 자극하고 즐거움을 주는 과정이 됩니다.\n물론, 어떤 AI 도구도 대신해 줄 수 없는 한 가지 필수 요소가 있습니다. 바로 ‘인내심’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하게 모든 글에 적용하려 하지 마세요. 어려운 텍스트를 위해 NotebookLM을 사용해 보고 싶다면, 작게 시작하는 것이 중요해요. 하나의 긴 기사, 그중에서도 하나의 문단, 딱 한 번의 ‘다시 읽기’부터 시작해 보세요. 그것만으로도 2026년 여러분의 깊이 읽는 습관을 재부팅하기에 충분할 겁니다. 새로운 지적 여정을 응원합니다!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: NotebookLM의 ‘느린 읽기’ 방법이 모든 유형의 글에 효과적인가요?\nA1: 아니요, 이 방법은 주로 복잡하거나 깊이 있는 이해가 필요한 장문의 텍스트에 특히 효과적입니다. 뉴스 기사나 짧은 정보성 글에는 일반적인 NotebookLM의 요약 기능을 활용하는 것이 더 효율적일 수 있습니다. 중요한 것은 글의 목적과 자신의 학습 목표에 맞춰 유연하게 적용하는 것입니다.\nQ2: NotebookLM 맞춤 지침을 설정하는 것이 정말 큰 차이를 만드나요?\nA2: 네, 예상보다 훨씬 큰 차이를 만듭니다. 맞춤 지침은 NotebookLM이 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 정보를 처리하고 응답하도록 유도하여, 단순한 답변을 넘어 사고를 촉진하는 파트너 역할을 수행하게 합니다. ‘질문을 우선해 달라’는 지침이 특히 효과적이에요.\nQ3: ‘마이크로 드릴’이 전통적인 퀴즈와 다른 점은 무엇인가요?\nA3: 마이크로 드릴은 짧고 특정 섹션에 집중하며, 정답을 맞히기보다 이해의 공백을 드러내고 사고를 유도하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 전통적인 퀴즈가 전체적인 지식 점검이라면, 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 미묘한 이해 부족을 파고드는 ‘근육 운동’에 가깝습니다.\nQ4: ‘느린 읽기’ 습관을 들이는 데 가장 중요한 것은 무엇인가요?\nA4: 가장 중요한 것은 ‘인내심’과 ‘작게 시작하는 용기’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하려 하기보다, 작은 성공 경험을 통해 점진적으로 습관을 확장해 나가는 것이 중요해요. 혼란을 실패로 여기지 않고, 더 깊이 파고들 기회로 삼는 태도가 필요합니다.\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"NotebookLM의 ‘느린 읽기’ 방법이 모든 유형의 글에 효과적인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"아니요, 이 방법은 주로 복잡하거나 깊이 있는 이해가 필요한 장문의 텍스트에 특히 효과적입니다. 뉴스 기사나 짧은 정보성 글에는 일반적인 NotebookLM의 요약 기능을 활용하는 것이 더 효율적일 수 있습니다. 중요한 것은 글의 목적과 자신의 학습 목표에 맞춰 유연하게 적용하는 것입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"NotebookLM 맞춤 지침을 설정하는 것이 정말 큰 차이를 만드나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 예상보다 훨씬 큰 차이를 만듭니다. 맞춤 지침은 NotebookLM이 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 정보를 처리하고 응답하도록 유도하여, 단순한 답변을 넘어 사고를 촉진하는 파트너 역할을 수행하게 합니다. ‘질문을 우선해 달라’는 지침이 특히 효과적이에요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"‘마이크로 드릴’이 전통적인 퀴즈와 다른 점은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"마이크로 드릴은 짧고 특정 섹션에 집중하며, 정답을 맞히기보다 이해의 공백을 드러내고 사고를 유도하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 전통적인 퀴즈가 전체적인 지식 점검이라면, 마이크로 드릴은 실시간으로 미묘한 이해 부족을 파고드는 ‘근육 운동’에 가깝습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"‘느린 읽기’ 습관을 들이는 데 가장 중요한 것은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"가장 중요한 것은 ‘인내심’과 ‘작게 시작하는 용기’입니다. 처음부터 완벽하려 하기보다, 작은 성공 경험을 통해 점진적으로 습관을 확장해 나가는 것이 중요해요. 혼란을 실패로 여기지 않고, 더 깊이 파고들 기회로 삼는 태도가 필요합니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

AI 시대 채용의 기준, 새로워진 잡코리아 (09:30)\n발표자: 윤현준 CEO\n1-1. 혁신의 딜레마와 업의 재정의\n과거의 성공이 미래를 보장하지 않음 (블록버스터 vs 넷플릭스)\n\n블록버스터는 2004년 북미 9천여 개 매장을 가진 1위 기업이었지만, 'DVD 대여업'이라는 수단에만 집중하다 2010년 파산함.\n반면 넷플릭스는 '영상 콘텐츠 전달'이라는 본질에 집중해 살아남음.\n잡코리아도 지난 30년 1등이었지만, \"우리는 채용 공고 상품(DVD)을 파는 회사인가, 일과 사람을 연결(콘텐츠 전달)하는 회사인가?\"라는 질문에 봉착.\n단기적 성과(공고 판매)에 안주하는 환상형 혁신을 경계하고, 업의 본질을 재정의하기로 결정.\n새로운 사명: Worxphere (웍스피어)\n\nWork + Experience + Sphere: 일과 경험, 그리고 그 모든 영역을 아우르는 생태계를 의미함.\n잡코리아(정규직), 알바몬(비정규직), 잡플래닛(기업 정보/평판), 나인하이어(ATS), 클릭(외국인), 놉(명함)을 모두 아우르는 통합 HR 테크 그룹으로 재출범하여 일의 경험 전체를 설계할 예정\n1-2. 핵심 기술: Context Link (맥락적 연결)\n기존 데이터의 한계: 정량적 데이터 (Spec)\n\n기존 이력서나 공고는 스펙의 나열에 불과함.\n옷 비유\n\n\"2XL 양가죽 재킷\"이라는 정보(스펙)만으로는 이 옷의 핏(Fit)이나 촉감, 스타일이 나에게 맞는지 알 수 없다.\n이로 인해 서류상 조건은 맞는데 막상 만나보면 안 맞는 미스 매칭 발생.\n새로운 솔루션: 정성적 데이터 (Context)의 결합\n\n잡플래닛 인수 시너지: 잡플래닛이 가진 기업 리뷰, 면접 경험, 조직 문화 등 '맥락 데이터'를 AI가 학습함.\nContext Link: 정량적 데이터(잡코리아) + 정성적 데이터(잡플래닛)를 결합해 AI가 맥락(Context)을 파악.\n사용 예시: 단순히 \"마케터 검색해줘\"가 아니라, \"육아휴직 간 1년 차 김대리 자리에 딱 맞는, 우리 팀 분위기에 적응할 사람 찾아줘\"라고 하면 AI가 숨은 의도까지 파악해 매칭함.\n1-3. 미래 비전: Career Genome (커리어 게놈)\n이력서의 종말 (Resume -> Genome)\n\n사람이 직접 쓰고 관리하는 정적인 이력서(Resume)는 아날로그의 산물임.\nAI가 실시간 행동 데이터와 성과를 분석해 관리하는 '다이내믹 디지털 프로필(Career Genome)'로 진화.\n검증에서 예측으로\n\n과거 이력 확인(Verification)을 넘어, 이 사람이 우리 조직에 왔을 때 낼 미래 성과(Prediction)를 예측하는 모델로 전환.\n1-4. 출시 예정 서비스 요약 (Roadmap)\n컨퍼런스에서 공개된, 올 상반기부터 순차적으로 출시될 핵심 서비스들.\nTalent Agent (기업용): 인사 담당자가 자연어로 질문하면(\"육아휴직 대체자 찾아줘\"), AI가 내부/외부 데이터를 분석해 최적의 후보자를 추천하고 소싱까지 대행.\nCareer Agent (개인용): 구직자의 행동 패턴을 분석해, 공고를 검색하지 않아도 \"이 회사가 당신에게 딱 맞아요\"라고 선제적으로 제안.\nHiring Center (통합 솔루션): 공고 등록, 지원자 관리, 채용 성과 분석, 평판 관리(잡플래닛 연동)를 한곳에서 처리하는 올인원 대시보드.\n2. 왜 채용은 항상 어려운가: 구조적 진단과 전환 (10:50)\n발표자: 이창준 CSO\n2-1. 채용 시장의 난제 (Problem)\n구직자는 늘었는데 채용은 더 어려움\n\n지난 3년간 구직자는 늘었지만, 기업이 느끼는 채용 난이도와 비용은 역대 최고 수준임.\n본인도 인재 영입을 위해 지난 9월 충무로에서 판교까지 한 달간 20번 넘게 직접 찾아가 티타임을 했던 경험을 공유\n원인 1: 희소성 (Scarcity)\n\n과거엔 '마케터'면 충분했지만, 지금은 '그로스 마케터 + 특정 예산 운영 경험 + 대행사 핸들링 경험 + 우리 문화 적합성'을 모두 요구함.\n맥락(Context)에 맞는 인재를 찾다 보니 대상자가 극도로 희소해짐.\n원인 2: 시급성 (Urgency)\n\n구직자들은 더 이상 기다리지 않음. 쇼핑하듯 여러 기업을 동시에 비교하고, 경험이 나쁘면 바로 이탈함.\n기업은 검증하느라 시간이 걸리는데, 그사이 인재는 다른 곳으로 가버림.\n2-2. 해결책: AI Agent의 4가지 역할 (Solution)\nAI가 단순 요약봇이 아니라, 채용 프로세스를 대행하는 에이전트(Agent)가 되어야 한다며 4가지 역할을 정의\nRole 1: 결정 (Decision) - \"맞는지 판단해줘\"\n\n면접관들이 \"이 사람 툴은 잘 쓰는데 우리 문화에 맞을까?\"라며 결정을 미루는 시간을 줄여줌.\n스펙뿐만 아니라 '맥락 증거'를 찾아 판단 근거를 제공하여 모호한 의사결정 지원.\nRole 2: 발굴 (Discovery) - \"찾아가서 데려와\"\n\n수동 -> 능동: 공고 올리고 기다리는 방식은 끝남.\nAI가 우리 회사에 맞을법한 인재(심지어 구직 의사가 없는 잠재 후보자)를 먼저 찾아내 리스트업하고 설득함.\nRole 3: 전환 (Conversion) - \"놓치지 않게 잡아줘\"\n\n'2분 vs 1주일의 법칙'\n\n밤 11시에 침대에서 스마트폰으로 지원한 후보자에게 2분 만에 \"내일 면접 가능하신가요?\"라고 묻는 기업과, 1주일 뒤에 이메일 보내는 기업의 승패는 명확함.\nAI 에이전트가 24시간 대응하며 지원자가 이탈하지 않도록 경험 관리.\nRole 4: 통합 (Integration) - Hiring Center\n\n슬랙, 노션, 엑셀, 채용 사이트 등으로 파편화된 데이터를 하나로 모음.\n하이어링 센터(Hiring Center): 모든 채용 데이터가 흐르도록 통합해, 데이터 기반의 의사결정 지원.\n3. AI Agent가 바꾸는 채용의 미래 (14:30)\n발표자: 김요섭 CTO\n3-1. 검색의 한계와 에이전트의 필요성\n검색은 정확한 키워드가 필요함\n\n포워드 디플로이드 엔지니어(Forward Deployed Engineers, FDE)를 뽑으려면 JD를 정확히 이해하고 키워드를 넣어야 함.\n하지만 인사담당자가 회사 내 모든 직무의 전문 용어와 맥락을 이해하는 것은 불가능에 가까움.\n그 결과, \"시니어 프론트엔드 개발자\" 1명을 찾기 위해 100명의 프로필을 뒤지고 2시간을 허비하는 비효율이 발생함.\n상황(Context)을 이해하는 AI\n\n음악 추천의 예: 과거엔 \"네가 좋아하는 장르니까 들어봐\"였다면, AI 시대엔 \"야근 중이고 집중이 필요한 너에게 맞는 곡이야\"라고 제안함.\n채용도 마찬가지. 단순 조건 매칭이 아니라 \"지금 우리 팀이 신규 서비스 런칭 직전인데, 실행력 빠른 스타트업 출신 자바 개발자가 필요해\"라는 문장을 이해해야 함.\n3-2. 웍스피어의 AI 에이전트 라인업\nTalent Agent (기업용)\n\n자연어 기반 소싱: 복잡한 필터링 대신 문장으로 질문하면 AI가 의도를 파악해 인재 추천.\n유사 인재 찾기: \"이 링크드인 프로필과 비슷한 사람 찾아줘\"라고 요청하면, 해당 인재의 역량과 맥락을 분석해 유사한 후보자를 웍스피어 데이터베이스(천만 명 규모)에서 발굴함.\n포워드 디플로이드 엔지니어(Forward Deployed Engineers, FDE)처럼 낯선 직무도 AI가 먼저 JD를 학습하고 적합한 스펙을 역제안함.\nCareer Agent (구직자용)\n\n단순 공고 추천을 넘어 '합격 전략'까지 제공.\n구직자의 이력과 행동 데이터를 학습해, \"이 공고는 당신의 A 경험과는 맞지만 B 역량은 보완이 필요해요\"라며 구체적인 가이드와 자소서 작성 전략까지 코칭함.\n왜 웍스피어인가? (Why Now?)\n\nAI 기술력은 기본, 핵심은 데이터의 '양과 깊이'.\n잡코리아, 알바몬, 게임잡 등 전 산업군의 데이터 + 잡플래닛의 정성적 리뷰 데이터(맥락)가 결합되어야만 진짜 '성향 파악'이 가능\n4. 이제 채용도 퍼포먼스다 (15:00)\n발표자: 박소리 JK 사업실장\n4-1. 기존 채용 상품의 문제: '성실함'의 함정\n누구나 똑같은 광고를 봄\n\n기존 배너 광고는 고정된 위치에 고정된 시간 동안 노출되는 '성실한' 상품이었음.\n하지만 마케터 공고를 시설관리자가 보거나, 부산 기업 공고를 서울 구직자가 보는 비효율 발생.\n스타트업 시절, 돈을 써서 광고를 해도 지원자가 없거나 핏이 안 맞는 지원자만 몰려서 이력서 검토하느라 시간만 쓰는 악순환을 경험함.\n4-2. 해결책: Smart Pick (스마트픽)\n집요하고 똑똑한 채용 상품\n\n타겟팅: 컨텍스트 링크 알고리즘을 통해, 내 공고에 반응할 확률이 높은 구직자에게만 선별적으로 노출함.\n성과 기반 과금: 기간제(기간당 얼마)가 아니라, 구직자가 공고를 클릭하거나 조회했을 때만 비용이 발생하는 합리적 모델 도입.\n실제 성과 사례\n\nF&B 기업: 기존 상품 대비 지원자 수 3배 증가, 비용 30% 절감.\nK-뷰티 기업: 8개월간 못 뽑던 포지션 채용 성공, 비용 60% 절감. 담당자가 \"나만 알고 싶으니 홍보하지 말라\"고 할 정도.\n4-3. 통합 관리와 편의성\nHiring Center (하이어링 센터)\n\n잡코리아, 알바몬, 외국인 채용(클릭) 등 모든 채용 공고와 지원자를 한 곳에서 관리.\n데이터 시각화 대시보드를 제공해, 인사담당자가 상사에게 \"이번 채용 광고 효율이 이렇습니다\"라고 캡처 한 방으로 보고할 수 있게 지원.",

NHN Cloud NCUI개발팀 이진우입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n저는 매주 30여 개의 Web, Frontend, Design, Design System 등의 기술 뉴스레터를 살피고 동료들에게 공유해 왔는데요. 작년에 이어 올해도 개인적으로 인상 깊었던 아티클을 주제별로 공유드리고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 작년에 공유했던 2024년의 프론트엔드 뉴스 모음은 아래 경로에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\r\r\n>  [2024 프론트엔드 뉴스 한 방에 몰아 보기](https://meetup.nhncloud.com/posts/390)\r\r\n\r\r\n관심사와 조직 내 영향력이 큰 기술 스택을 중심으로 정리한 내용이기에 프론트엔드 생태계 전체를 대변한다고 보기는 어렵지만, 흥미가 가는 주제가 있다면 함께 첨부한 링크들이 출발점으로서 작은 도움이 되기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> 본문의 링크들은 과거 시점 기준의 자료이므로 변경된 내용이 있을 수 있습니다.  \r\r\n\r\r\n## Node.js의 TypeScript 지원\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 초 Node.js는 Bun, Deno와 같은 경쟁자들에게 대적하기 위해 TypeScript 파일 실행 지원을 추가했습니다. 개발자 경험을 향상시키는 것이 주 목적이었기에 타입 체크, 컴파일이 아닌 타입을 걷어내는 것(Type Stripping)으로 방향을 잡았는데요. 이를 위해 SWC를 기반으로 한 Amaro가 핵심 도구로 기대 받았고, TypeScript 측에서도 관련 플래그를 추가했으며 최근 v24.12 버전에서 안정화 단계에 들어서게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Type Stripping 개념과 구현\r\r\n\r\r\nNode.js가 채택한 Type Stripping 방식의 원리와 구현 배경을 다룹니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Node.js now supports TypeScript by default](https://www.totaltypescript.com/typescript-is-coming-to-node-23)\r\r\n* [Everything you need to know about node.js type stripping](https://satanacchio.hashnode.dev/everything-you-need-to-know-about-nodejs-type-stripping)\r\r\n* [The Summer I Shipped Type Stripping](https://satanacchio.hashnode.dev/the-summer-i-shipped-type-stripping)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 생태계 지원 현황\r\r\n\r\r\nTypeScript 5.8의 플래그 추가, Amaro 1.0 릴리스, Node.js 안정화 버전 등 생태계 전반의 지원 현황입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Announcing TypeScript 5.8](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-8/#the---erasablesyntaxonly-option)\r\r\n* [Node.js Moves Toward Stable TypeScript Support with Amaro 1.0](https://socket.dev/blog/node-js-moves-toward-stable-typescript-support-with-amaro-1-0)\r\r\n* [Node.js v24.12.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v24.12.0)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 런타임 간 비교\r\r\n\r\r\nDeno와 Node.js의 TypeScript 지원 비교입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Node just added TypeScript support. What does that mean for Deno?](https://deno.com/blog/typescript-in-node-vs-deno)\r\r\n\r\r\n## React 2025 회고\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 React를 보면 프론트엔드의 인프라라고 불러야 할 만큼 범위가 넓어졌습니다. LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `<Activity />` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등 v19에서 도입된 주요 기능들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/3-ways-to-build-forms-in-react)\r\r\n* [Building Reusable Components with

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Rust 전환 시 기존 대비 10-100배의 성능 향상이 가능하기 때문에, 복잡해진 프론트엔드 생태계에서 이 흐름은 이제 거스르기 어려워 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n가장 두드러진 성과를 내는 곳은 VoidZero로 보입니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다. '이게 좋다' 하면 모두가 몰려가고, '저게 정답이다' 하면 또 그쪽으로 쏠리는 흐름이 반복됐습니다. 그 와중에 인상 깊었던 LLM 사용 사례와 아티클, 도구를 정리해 공유합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI 코딩의 한계와 책임\r\r\n\r\r\nLLM 기반 개발의 한계점과 개발자 책임에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to \"write better code?\"](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)\r\r\n* [Why you shouldn't use AI to write documentation](https://zeroheight.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-documentation/)\r\r\n* [Why Your AI Coding Assistant Keeps Doing It Wrong, and How To Fix It](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)\r\r\n* [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\r\r\n* [dead framework theory](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/)\r\r\n* [How to Fix Any Bug](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기업 도입 사례\r\r\n\r\r\nSpotify, Airbnb 등 대규모 조직의 AI 도입 경험입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1,500+ PRs Later: Spotify’s Journey with Our Background Coding Agent (Part 1)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/spotifys-background-coding-agent-part-1)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b)\r\r\n\r\r\n### MCP와 컨텍스트 엔지니어링\r\r\n\r\r\nModel Context Protocol과 효과적인 AI 활용을 위한 컨텍스트 설계입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [MCP explained without hype of fluff](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/12/mcp-explained-without-hype-or-fluff)\r\r\n* [Chrome DevTools MCP Server](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp)\r\r\n* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\r\r\n* [Minification isn't obfuscation - Claude Code proves it](https://martinalderson.com/posts/minification-isnt-obfuscation-claude-code-proves-it/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI시대의 개발 방법론\r\r\n\r\r\nAPI 설계, 문서화, 추상화 등 AI와 함께하는 개발 방법론입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Design APIs for an AI World ](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world)\r\r\n* [Writing documentation for AI: best practices](https://docs.kapa.ai/improving/writing-best-practices/)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Conversation: LLMs and Building Abstractions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html)\r\r\n* [Attention Is the New Big-O](https://alexchesser.medium.com/attention-is-the-new-big-o-9c68e1ae9b27/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 유용한 도구\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 개발에 활용할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) - 전체 Repository를 AI 친화적인 단일 파일로 압축\r\r\n* [repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt) - GitHub Repository를 단일 텍스트로 변환, GUI 기반으로 파일 선택 가능\r\r\n* [ai-digest](https://github.com/khromov/ai-digest) - 코드베이스를 하나의 마크다운 파일로 생성\r\r\n* [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) - Claude 기반 AI 에이전트를 여러 개 연결해 협업, 복잡한 작업을 단계별 워크플로우로 자동화\r\r\n* [agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules) - Cursor, Claude Code 같은 AI 코드 어시스턴트에게 일관된 행동 지침을 적용하는 규칙 템플릿 모음\r\r\n* [Conductor](https://conductor.build/) - Claude Code를 여러 개 동시에 실행하며 관리하는 도구\r\r\n* [Terragon](https://www.terragonlabs.com/) - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex 등 AI 코딩 에이전트를 클라우드에서 병렬 실행\r\r\n* [react-grab](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) - 페이지의 모든 요소를 선택해 AI 코딩 에이전트에게 컨텍스트로 전달, 단일 스크립트 태그로 설치\r\r\n* [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) - GitHub에서 다양한 MCP 서버를 모아둔 레지스트리\r\r\n* [streamdown](https://streamdown.ai/) - AI Chat 서비스처럼 마크다운 스트리밍 렌더링 지원\r\r\n* [lean-spec](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec) - 경량 SDD(Spec-Driven Development) 프레임워크\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그 외 분야별 소식\r\r\n\r\r\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년도 JavaScript와 TypeScript 생태계는 활발하게 움직였습니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "창업가나 투자자라면 ‘피칭’이라는 말이 너무나 익숙할 것이다. 창업가라면 투자받기 위해서 VC들을 대상으로 셀 수 없을 정도로 사업에 관해서 설명하는 피칭을 했을 것이다. 우리도 작년에 수백 개의 피칭을 듣고 봤다. 그런데 우리 같은 VC도 투자하기 위해서는 남의 투자를 받아야 해서 우리도 펀드레이징을 하고, 꽤 많은 피칭을 한다. 우리는 작년 9월에 새로운 펀드를 만들었는데, 나중에 통계를 내보니까 이 펀드를 만들기 위해서 180명이 넘는 투자자를(=LP) 대상으로 피칭했다. 어떤 분들은 그냥 줌으로 한 번 온라인 미팅만 했지만, 어떤 해외 투자자는 10번 이상 대면 미팅한 경우도 있었다.\n물론, 이들이 스트롱에게 모두 다 돈을 준 건 아니다. 이 중 일부만 우리에게 출자했고, 대부분의 미팅을 전쟁에 임하는 태도로 열심히, 에너지 넘치게, 그리고 기세 넘치게 진행했기 때문에, 특히나 우리에게 자금을 출자한 분들과의 미팅은 아직도 머릿속에 생생하게 기억한다. 이 중 기억에 남는 미팅이 하나 있는데, 당시의 상황을 간략하게 설명하면, 펀드를 마무리해야 하는 데드라인이 몇 주 안 남았었고, 이 투자자의 돈은 꼭 받아야만 하는 상황이었다. 그런데 실은, 이미 이 투자자에게 과거에 두 번 피칭했다 두 번 모두 거절당했기 때문에, 세 번째 시도는(=삼수) 마지막 기회였다. 절박함에 대해서 우리는 자주 이야기하는데, 당시 내 심정은 절박함 그 자체였고, 정말로 비장한 각오로 줌 피칭 미팅을 시작했다.\n피칭하기 바로 전날 밤으로 상황을 리와인드 해보자. 실은 발표해야 하는 내용은 내가 14년 동안 직접 해왔던 거라서 아주 익숙했지만, 그래도 나는 전날 밤에 10번 연달아서 리허설을 했다. 약 20분 정도의 발표이니 거의 세 시간을 같은 내용을 미친 사람처럼 달달 다시 연습했던 것이다. 줌으로 파워포인트 발표를 해본 분들은 잘 아시겠지만, 화면 공유할 때 파워포인트의 포인터/펜 기능이 가끔 충돌을 일으킬 때가 있고, 강조해야 할 부분을 빨간펜으로 체크하면서 발표하다 보면 그다음 슬라이드로 넘어가지 않는 알려진 문제점도 있다. 나는 발표의 흐름을 끊을 수 있는 이런 문제점들을 사전에 모두 방지하기 위해서, 그 전날 10번 리허설을 상대편에는 아무도 없지만, 실제로 줌을 켜고 라이브로 연습했다. 그리고 연습하면서 파워포인트의 포인터 -> 펜 -> 줌의 화면 공유 상에서의 페이지 넘기기, 이 전환이 매끄럽게 될 수 있게 충분히 연습했다.\n다시 실제 피칭하는 순간으로 패스트포워드 해보자. 전날 연습을 충분히 했기 때문에 나는 자신감이 넘쳤고, 이번에도 돈을 못 받는 건 고려 대상이 아니라는 벼랑 끝에 선 각오로 엄청나게 기세 있게 발표했다. 온라인이고 작은 노트북 화면에서 발표하는 거지만, 반대편에 보이는 약 10명의 청중의 눈을 하나씩 맞추려고 노력했고, 엄청난 기세를 이들에게 100% 전달하겠다는 각오로 거의 샤우팅 하듯이 피칭했다. 그리고 이분들에게 우리는 돈을 받았다는 해피엔딩으로 이 피칭 이야기는 끝난다.\n나중에, 이 LP들에게 들었다. 화면으로만 나를 보고 들었지만, 정말로 스트롱이 돈을 꼭 받아야겠다는 독기를 품었다는 각오가 강하게 느껴졌고, 정말 그 엄청난 기세가 줌 화면을 통해서도 생생하게 온몸으로 전달됐다고.\n“인생은 기세다.”라는 말을 우리는 자주 한다. 밑바닥에서 시작해서 성공한 연예인들이 이 말을 하는 것을 나는 자주 들었다. 그런데 나도 좀 살아보고, 일도 좀 해보고, 투자도 좀 해보니 정말로 이 기세가 중요하다는 걸 느끼고 있다. 창업도 기세, 펀드레이징도 기세, 글로벌 진출도 기세, 심지어 우리 같은 VC가 하는 벤처 투자도 기세다. 이 모든 게 안 될 이유가 백만 가지가 있는, 했다 하면 실패할 게 거의 뻔한 일들이다. 그 와중에 되게 만들어야 하고, 되게 할 이유를 찾아야 하는데, 이건 자신감과 기세가 없으면 매우 힘든 일이다. 우리 주변에 불가능을 가능케 하는 사람들을 보면, 가끔 나는 이들이 짐승 같다고 생각한다. 그만큼 본인들이 목표하는 걸 무조건 해야겠다는 의지와 이를 막는 사람들은 모두 다 짐승같이 씹어 먹어버리겠다는 기세가 보이기 때문이다.\n기세는 실제로 그 일을 하는 사람에게 발동을 걸고, 누가 봐도 안 될 일을 계속 시도하게 만드는 희망과 에너지의 원동력이다. 하지만, 기세는 그 일을 하는 사람의 힘든 여정을 같이 하는 주변 사람들에게도 전류와 같이 흐르면서 안 될 일을 되게 만드는 방향으로 기운을 흐르게 만들 수도 있다고 생각한다. 내가 피칭할 때 내 기세가 분명히 발표를 듣는 분들에게도 전달됐고, 이들의 결정에 긍정적인 영향을 미쳤다고 나는 믿는다.\n그럼, 이 기세는 어디서 나오는 건가? 내 경험에 의하면 기세는 누구나 다 후천적으로 습득할 수 있는 기술이자 자산이다. 기세는 자신감에서 나온다. 그럼, 자신감은 어디서 나오나? 결국엔 수년, 수십 년 동안 반복하는 좋은 습관과 연습에서 나온다.",

(예: 타지 대학생 자녀를 위해 빌린 오피스텔 등)\n내 집 마련 대출, 소득공제도 실수 없이!\n전세자금대출이나 주택담보대출을 갚고 있다면 이 항목을 주목하세요.\n⓵ 전세자금대출(주택임차자금): 2025년 12월 31일 기준 무주택 세대의 세대주여야 원리금 상환액을 공제받을 수 있습니다.\n⓶ 주택담보대출(장기주택저당차입금): 2025년 12월 31일 기준 무주택 또는 1주택 보유 세대의 세대주여야 이자 상환액을 공제받을 수 있어요. (세대주가 공제받지 않는 경우 세대원도 가능)\n⓷ 집값과 명의도 중요해요: 기준시가가 6억 원을 초과하는 주택이거나, 주택 소유자 명의가 아닌 대출은 공제 대상이 아닙니다. (6억 원 기준은 2024년 1월 1일 이후 취득분부터 적용돼요.)\n의료비 세액공제는 '실제로 낸 돈'만 계산해요\n나와 가족을 위해 쓴 의료비, 하지만 내가 직접 부담한 금액이 아니라면 제외해야 합니다.\n⓵ 보험금은 빼주세요: 의료비를 지출하고 실손 의료보험금을 수령했다면, 그 금액만큼은 공제 대상 의료비에서 제외해야 합니다.\n⓶ 사후환급금도 제외: 본인 부담 상한제 등으로 나중에 돌려받은 금액이 있다면 이 역시 공제 대상에서 제외해야 해요. 다만, 나중에 환급금이 발생해 수정신고를 하는 경우에는 가산세가 적용되지 않으니 안심하세요.\n국세청은 과다공제를 받은 것으로 추정되는 근로자를 대상으로 매년 하반기에 점검을 실시합니다. 실수로 공제를 더 많이 받았다가 나중에 가산세까지 더해 세금을 부담할 수 있으니 유의해야 합니다. 더 궁금한 점은 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}국세청 누리집이나 국세상담센터(126)를 통해 확인할 수 있습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}※ 해당 콘텐츠는 2026.01.23. 배포된 .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}국세청 보도자료를 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.",

While iconic American companies were born in college dorm rooms or in garages, Toss took root in the ordinary streets of Seoul, where people’s everyday lives take place.\nAround that time, four team members were scattered across Seoul, searching for the right business idea. They observed how people behaved, what inconveniences they faced, and where they spent most of their time. From these field observations came more than a hundred potential ideas like services for rating restaurant menus, a platform for amateur singers to upload performance videos, an app that takes photos of and stores receipts, and among them was making “money transfers and payments frictionless.”\nToss, in other words, didn’t set out from the start to be a “fintech startup.” The goal was simply to build something people genuinely needed, whatever that might be. This determination wasn’t built overnight. Before launching Toss, its founder Seunggun Lee had spent five years pursuing projects he wanted to do and building products he wanted to create. He failed eight times. Those repeated disappointments came to a costly and painful realization : it’s not about what I want to do, it’s about what people want.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\nThe reasons for his repeated failures finally became clear. At the same time, Seunggun Lee found himself in turmoil. He had started a company to pursue what he loved, only to realize that chasing what he wanted would never lead to success. (...) “It was a wake-up call. I told myself to stop messing around. Forget what you want , forget your ego. From now on, chase what will succeed. Let go of the pride. You’re just someone who makes what people want.”\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-1ebvaan{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}- .css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}Kyounghwa Jung, No Ordinary Challenge, Bookstone, 2022, p.29–30.css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\nIt was clear that people wanted ‘convenient’ finance. In the early 2010s, sending money online in Korea was likened to performing a small ritual. You had to install specific software, import your accredited certificate, dig out your security card to enter the code, and then type in a one-time password. Even the simplest everyday moments of splitting a dinner bill with a friend or paying for something online were unnecessarily cumbersome. The world was rapidly moving online, but money transfers and payments remained stuck in the past. Overseas, things were different. In the United States, PayPal and Cash App were already well established, and in the UK, TransferWise (now Wise) had gained traction. Toss began with a simple question : Why should sending and receiving money be so difficult?\nA few years earlier, Seunggun Lee had been making donations to the Purme Foundation, a relationship that began while he was working at a dental hospital for people with disabilities. One day, a question crossed his mind: “What authority does the Purme Foundation have to withdraw money directly from my bank account?” That single thought became the starting point. (...) The answer was in recurring payments. He discovered that recurring payments weren’t just used for nonprofit donations, but also for things like paying for milk deliveries or newspaper subscriptions. When a business used such recurring payments, it could automatically withdraw funds from a customer’s account on a set date and deposit them into the designated account. (…) Finally, it seemed as though he had found a solution.\n- Kyounghwa Jung, No Ordinary Challenge, Bookstone, 2022, p.35–36\nOn February 23, 2015, Toss officially introduced its simple money transfer service to the world. Open the app, enter the amount, type in an account number or contact, and finish with a password made of just four digits and one letter. That was it. The transfer was complete. To reassure users who thought it was almost too easy, Toss displayed a message on the screen: .css-1odxvuk{white-space:pre-wrap;font-style:italic;}“The transfer is complete. Really.”\nPeople responded quickly. Three out of ten users came back the following week, and seven out of ten returned a month later.* The daily transaction volume and number of active users grew 1.4 times every week. That meant four to five times more activity in just a month, a pace rarely seen in financial apps. After a long, arduous journey, Toss finally found itself at the real starting line. Along the way, it embedded two lessons into its DNA: create services people truly need, and never be afraid of failure.\n* In the weeks right after launch, Toss’ weekly retention exceeded 30%, and its monthly retention reached as high as 70%.\nI realized that victory comes with humility, and with the courage to admit your weaknesses. To me, success begins when you no longer fear the sting of failure. Two teams can pursue the same idea, but it’s the mindset that determines which team succeeds.\n- Seunggun Lee, Toss Team Leader, ”The Beginning of Toss: PO SESSION”, Toss YouTube channel\nToss started to raise more questions. “Why should people have to pay to check their credit?” “Why does getting a loan take so long?” “Why is investment so complicated?” These were the kind of questions that were so plain and ordinary that most people overlooked. But Toss didn’t let them pass. It started searching for answers, and those answers turned into services that changed the market. From industry-first offerings like free credit checks and a loan comparison service to Toss Securities, which made investing accessible directly from your phone, and Toss Bank, which made banking as easy and casual as daily life, each question became a spark for everyday change.\nBy the summer of 2025, Toss had surpassed 30 million cumulative users. What began as a simple money transfer app had grown to offer more than 100 services, present at nearly every moment when money moves. The number of services has expanded, but the North Star remains unchanged: to question the obvious, find better answers, and redefine the standards of the world. The questions drawn from people’s everyday lives remain at the heart of Toss, fueling its extraordinary challenge even today.\nFollow us on .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}LinkedIn and explore more detailed updates about Toss.",
