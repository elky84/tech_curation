        "content:encodedSnippet": "In October 2023, we launched the Early Access Program for Writerside – a tool for authoring, testing, and publishing documentation. Built on the IntelliJ Platform, Writerside was available in two versions: a standalone tool and a plugin for JetBrains IDEs. Our goal was to serve two key audiences – developers who document their work and professional technical writers.\nSince then, we’ve published 14 EAP releases, run tests and surveys, and continuously analyzed your feedback and usage statistics. Unfortunately, the results did not align with our expectations. \nDespite strong adoption among developers and some technical writers, it became apparent that the overall market size was not large enough to sustain Writerside as a standalone product. \nFor these reasons, we have made the difficult decision to sunset Writerside.\nWriterside plugin support remains\nYou can use the Writerside IDE until March 20, 2025. After that date, your license will expire. However, the plugin will remain available for free on JetBrains Marketplace, and you can continue using it with your JetBrains IDE.\nIf you currently use the standalone version, you can start using the Writerside plugin with your JetBrains IDE, regardless of whether you have a commercial or non-commercial IDE license.\nIf you don’t currently use a JetBrains IDE, you can download IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition to continue using Writerside for free.\nWhile we do not plan any major changes to the functionality, we plan to continue providing support, updates, and bug fixes for the foreseeable future, as the Writerside plugin is used internally by JetBrains technical writers. \nThank you 💜\nOur team would like to thank all of you for the tremendous support and feedback you have provided along the way. While it is always sad when a product’s life ends, we’ll take everything we’ve learned with us as we move forward. We still believe that documentation tools deserve better, so maybe another way lies ahead in the future. \nThank you for being part of this journey! \nAlways on the writers’ side,\nYour Writerside team\nFAQ\nWhat is happening with the documentation builder?\nNo action is required. All previously set-up CI/CD integrations, GitHub actions, and Docker images will continue to work as before. \nWill you support EAP versions of JetBrains IDEs?\nThe plugin will be compatible with all upcoming IDE versions, including EAP builds. \nWhat will happen to my existing Writerside project? Can I still use your frontend reliably?\nYou can continue working with your existing Writerside project, and the frontend should function as expected. \nDo I need to migrate my projects from the Writerside IDE to the plugin?\nNo migration is needed. Just open your Writerside project with the plugin, and everything will work as it did before. \nWill all Writerside IDE features be available via the plugin?\nThe standalone version of Writerside and the plugin have the same set of features. Moreover, the plugin provides additional editor support for code samples supported by your IDE and the ability to validate them.\nWhere can I provide my feedback or get support?\nYou can share your feedback or get support in the Writerside Slack community. \nHave you considered open-sourcing the Writerside IDE?\nAt this point, we have no plans to open-source the Writerside IDE.",

Backed by large language models (LLMs) from both JetBrains and third parties, it helps you write better code, faster.\nHow to get started\nTo enable AI Assistant, open Android Studio Meerkat 2024.3.1, navigate to Plugins, search for JetBrains AI Assistant, and install the plugin.\n\n\n\n\nA smarter way to code in Android Studio\nJetBrains AI Assistant brings context-aware AI directly into Android Studio, enhancing Kotlin development and allowing you to focus on building innovative applications. \nAutomate tedious tasks and boost productivity \nAI Assistant speeds up development with intelligent code suggestions. Powered by Mellum, JetBrains’ advanced AI model, it offers code completion that understands context, suggests relevant code, and reduces manual typing. Additionally, AI Assistant streamlines tasks such as writing tests, resolving version control conflicts, generating commit messages, and documenting code.\nCustomize the AI to fit your workflow \nTake control of how AI integrates into your development process. Choose from cloud-based or local AI models, choose when to accept suggestions, and adjust prompts in the prompt library.\nGet AI assistance, even offline\nYou can connect local models via LM Studio or Ollama, which means you can interact with AI Assistant for explanations, refactoring suggestions, and any coding questions, without needing an internet connection. \nSee JetBrains AI Assistant in action\nLet’s take a look at how AI Assistant works in the JetSnack demo project, an example app for ordering snacks.\nCoding faster with code suggestions\nThe app currently lacks content descriptions for snack images, which are needed so screen readers can interpret them. AI Assistant’s code completion helps us modify the Snack data structure, suggesting a property for storing content descriptions. It even autocompletes entire blocks of code as we type.\n\n\n\n\nExpanding features with code generation\nWhile we were browsing the JetSnack app’s code, we noticed that it lacks a category for\nhealthy options. Using AI Assistant’s Generate Code shortcut, we can add this feature by simply writing a prompt in natural language.\n\n\n\n\nGenerating commit messages\nAfter making these improvements, it’s time to commit our changes. AI Assistant can generate a concise and informative commit message, summarizing the updates in a way that’s clear and easy to understand.\n\n\n\n\nWe value your feedback!\nWe’re eager to hear how AI Assistant improves your development experience. You can share feedback directly from the plugin by clicking Share feedback in the AI Assistant tool window, and you can report any bugs via YouTrack. Thank you!",

For a business that handles user data, there could be very imminent risk to customers and staff alike. \nAny development team could fall prey to the rise of cybercrime and attacks as detailed in the CyberCrime Report and many other sources. This is one reason why it’s so important to secure your codebase against both seemingly simple and more sophisticated and malicious activity. \nThen again, it’s easy to say that developer teams need to prioritize security, but this is sometimes difficult to put into practice. What frameworks are most helpful? Can they be applied to teams of any size and industry? And which standards do developers trust to help them achieve a level of foundational security and safety?\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is OWASP?\nCommon OWASP Top 10 checks\nSQL Injection\nPrevention is better than cure\nBroken Authentication\nSensitive data exposure\nXML External Entities (XXE)\nBroken Access Control\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nInsecure deserialization\n\nOWASP guidance in a nutshell\nJoin the discussion\n\n\nWhat is OWASP?\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization dedicated to improving software security. One of its primary contributions is the OWASP Top 10, which outlines the most critical security risks to web applications and provides the checks that organizations should consider when enhancing application security. While OWASP hasn’t officially released the list for 2025, we’re taking a closer list of some common contenders today. Let’s dive in: \nCommon OWASP Top 10 checks\nSQL Injection\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of injection attack where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code on a database by manipulating the SQL queries made by an application.\nHow it happens:\nSQLi typically happens when user inputs are directly included in SQL statements without proper validation or escaping. For example:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘user_input’;\nIf user_input is not sanitized, an attacker could input something like admin’ –, which might change the original query’s logic.\nPrevention is better than cure\nTo prevent this, you could use prepared statements with parameterized queries to separate SQL logic from user input. Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements that can accept parameters. Always validate and sanitize user inputs. \nEnsure that only expected values are accepted (e.g., alphanumeric validation) and avoid displaying detailed error messages to users, which could give attackers insights into the database structure. The database account used by the application should have no more privileges than necessary, that way one can at least reduce the impact if an SQL injection is successful.\nYou also get Command Injections, which the attacker manages to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. For example, an attacker might input ; rm -rf / to execute unauthorized commands. To prevent these you should avoid executing system commands, use safe, language-specific APIs that don’t invoke command shells, and if user inputs have to be included in a command shell, make sure that inputs are properly escaped. \nQodana’s Taint Analysis helps prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injections, and path traversal and is supported in IntelliJ IDEA as well as in Qodana for Php and JVM. \nBroken Authentication\nCheck for Broken Authentication aims to address vulnerabilities in user authentication processes and session management that can lead to a range of security risks.\nYou can address this by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and making sure sessions are securely managed. MFA is a security mechanism that requires users to use two or more independent credentials to verify their identity. \nInstead of just relying on a username and a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or brute-forced, MFA adds extra layers of security that make authentication more secure with biometric, device, or knowledge entries. If you use this in conjunction with secure session management, you have a good starting point for better and more secure authentication. \nPrevention measures\nIt matters how applications handle user sessions over the duration of their interactions with the system. When users log in an application, the application creates a session (or token) to keep track of their authenticated status. The identifiers for these have to be unique and transmitted securely using HTTPS to encrypt data between the client and the server. \nSensitive data exposure\nSensitive data can include personal information (PII), payment information, healthcare records, authentication credentials, and any other data that could be harmful if exposed.\nTo combat this, developers need to encrypt data in transit over networks and “at rest”, i.e. stored on servers and databases. \nYou can do this by generating cryptographic keys that use secure, random sources and only allow authorized people and applications to access them. Never hard-code keys in the application or configuration files. You can also implement a key rotation policy. \nAlso keep in mind that Hardcoded secrets are related to several items in the OWASP Top 10, particularly “Sensitive Data Exposure” and “Broken Authentication.” Detecting hardcoded passkeys helps to mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML External Entities (XXE)\nXML External Entities (XXE) is a vulnerability that happens when an XML parser doesn’t process external entity references properly. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability for:\nData exfiltration: Attackers can manipulate an XML input to read sensitive files from the server or sensitive information from other places.\nDenial of Service (DoS): By including a large number of entities in the XML file, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to service outages.\nServer Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Attackers can access internal services and resources which are not directly accessible from the outside world.\nThe best way to mitigate XXE vulnerabilities is to entirely disable the external entities being processed. This can usually be configured in the XML parsing libraries that your application is using. \nFor example, if you’re using Java with DOM or SAX parsers, you can configure them to disable DTD processing and external entities:\nDocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\ndbf.setValidating(false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities”, false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities”, false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl”, true);\nYou can also implement strict validation and schema checks for XML inputs. This process ensures that the XML data adheres to a predefined structure and is what your application expects.\nBroken Access Control\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used method for restricting system access to authorized users. In RBAC, permissions are assigned based on roles rather than individual users, which helps streamline the management of user access. However, without proper implementation and regular testing, systems can become vulnerable. \nGet ahead of access issues\nClearly define roles based on job responsibilities and least privilege principles. Ensure roles align closely with user needs and limit permissions to what is strictly necessary. Some organizations may need to define hierarchical roles. For instance, a manager could inherit the permissions of their subordinates, but without additional privileges that they do not require.\nConduct periodic reviews of roles and permissions to ensure they remain relevant and appropriate. Consider any role changes in personnel or shifts in organizational processes. Implement temporary or context-sensitive roles for particular tasks or projects. This way, users can gain additional permissions as needed without permanently extending their permissions.\nMaintain detailed logs of access attempts and regularly monitor these logs for any suspicious activity. This can help you spot any causes for concern like unwanted access. \nControl testing is another important tactic to help identify potential vulnerabilities like horizontal (same level access) and vertical (higher-level access) privileges.You can use automated security testing tools that can simulate various attack vectors to check for access control weaknesses. Tools can be used to check access control lists (ACLs) and role permissions programmatically.\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nImproper security configurations are one of OWASP’s major checks because default settings can create security risks. \nTo prevent this, change any default passwords right after installing new systems. Those default passwords are often widely known and can be a goldmine for attackers. \nAlso, many applications and operating systems come with unnecessary services turned on by default, so go through and turn off those unused features to decrease vulnerabilities. Also make sure that default roles and access permissions aren’t giving users more access than they really need.\nAlso, apply security hardening guidelines for servers, databases, and applications to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce attack surfaces.\nAnd keep in mind that before deploying patches to production systems, it’s important to test them in a staging environment to identify any potential compatibility issues or bugs that could arise from the update.\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into content delivered to users’ web browsers. When a user visits a page that contains XSS, the malicious script can execute within the context of that user’s session, leading to various risks, including data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of web applications.\nMitigating cross-site scripting risk\nMitigate this issue with output encoding to ensure that user inputs are properly encoded before they’re visible and only show up as plain text. You could do this by converting characters into their HTML equivalents, encoding characters that are specific to HTML attributes like “ and in JavaScript properly escaping a user input so that it won’t execute the script. You could also implement a content security policy to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. \nIf you’re using IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the Qodana plugin to find and address cross-site scripting. Find it under the Problems tab in the Security Analysis section. \n\n\n\n\nInsecure deserialization\nInsecure deserialization occurs when an application accepts data from untrusted sources and interprets it as a serialized object without proper validation. This opens the door for attackers to manipulate the serialized data, potentially leading to remote code execution, data tampering, or denial-of-service attacks. \nMitigate these risks\nAvoid deserializing untrusted data altogether. If deserialization is necessary, developers should implement stringent checks to validate the integrity and format of the incoming data. Using safe serialization formats, which don’t allow for arbitrary code execution, can hugely reduce the risks associated with processing untrusted data.\nIntegrity checks also play a big role in securing serialized data. Digital signatures or cryptographic hashes allow an application to verify that the serialized object has not been altered in any way it’s not supposed to be. \nBy signing serialized data with a private key, the application can later check the signature against the expected outcome using a public key, helping to ensure the data’s authenticity. Also, using hashes enables the application to confirm that the data remains unchanged. However, even with integrity checks, deserializing data from untrusted sources should be minimized or avoided.\nOWASP guidance in a nutshell\nSecure your application development and deployment more thoroughly by using these checks as a security benchmark. Regular security testing, code reviews, and security training for developers play a crucial role in minimizing risks associated with these vulnerabilities. \nIf you are implementing OWASP standards, consider using resources like the OWASP Cheat Sheets, OWASP Testing Guide, and OWASP Best Practices for secure coding. You can also use Qodana to look for issues and run select security checks in your CI/CD pipeline. \nJoin the discussion\nKeep a eye on X or JetBrains Bluesky for the announcement of our Taint Analysis roundtable – coming soon!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "For years, you’ve worked with Visual Studio’s solution file (*.SLN) format, and while it’s a core part of your project organization, we know the experience hasn’t always been smooth. Whether you’ve been modifying, maintaining, or trying to resolve merge conflicts, it’s often felt more like a hassle than it should be. We understand your frustrations, and we’re here to talk about why it’s time for a change and how a new solution file format can make your life easier.\nThe Challenges\nDespite being a critical element of the Visual Studio ecosystem, the existing solution file format has its share of drawbacks:\nManual Edits Are Tedious: Editing solution files manually is error-prone due to its tool-centric format. Small mistakes often lead to misconfigurations, disrupting your workflow.\nMerge Conflicts Are a Constant Issue: In team environments, merge conflicts in solution files can cause lost work, corrupted files, and delays, making it harder to focus on building software.\nVerbosity and Redundancy: Solution files start with over 200 characters, and as you add projects, they quickly become bloated with duplicate GUIDs and metadata, cluttering your work.\nNo Real Benefit from Duplication: Redundant references to project names and solution items provide little value and only add confusion, taking up space without improving your workflow.\nNon-Standard File Format: The .SLN file format is specific to Visual Studio and not a widely recognized standard, which limits its compatibility with external tools and automation.\nTo help you visualize these challenges, here’s an example of a traditional Visual Studio solution file:\nMicrosoft Visual Studio Solution File, Format Version 12.00\r\n# Visual Studio Version 17\r\nVisualStudioVersion = 17.9.34511.98\r\nMinimumVisualStudioVersion = 10.0.40219.1\r\nProject(\"{FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}\") = \"DotNetMonitorWebApp\", \"DotNetMonitorWebApp\\DotNetMonitorWebApp.csproj\", \"{1385B389-B20C-4D19-8FE0-85629BC41343}\"\r\nEndProject\r\nGlobal\r\nGlobalSection(SolutionConfigurationPlatforms) = preSolution\r\nDebug|Any CPU = Debug|Any CPU\r\nRelease|Any CPU = Release|Any CPU\r\nEndGlobalSection\r\nGlobalSection(ProjectConfigurationPlatforms) = postSolution\r\n{1385B389-B20C-4D19-8FE0-85629BC41343}.Debug|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Debug|Any CPU\r\n{1385B389-B20C-4D19-8FE0-85629BC41343}.Debug|Any CPU.Build.0 = Debug|Any CPU\r\n{1385B389-B20C-4D19-8FE0-85629BC41343}.Release|Any CPU.ActiveCfg = Release|Any CPU\r\n{1385B389-B20C-4D19-8FE0-85629BC41343}.Release|Any CPU.Build.0 = Release|Any CPU\r\nEndGlobalSection\r\nGlobalSection(SolutionProperties) = preSolution\r\nHideSolutionNode = FALSE\r\nEndGlobalSection\r\nGlobalSection(ExtensibilityGlobals) = postSolution\r\nSolutionGuid = {C12E911E-FAA3-4ACE-B6BF-C3605E866483}\r\nEndGlobalSection\r\nEndGlobal\r\n\nSimplifying the Solution File\nWe’ve made several improvements with the new solution file format to enhance your experience. These changes include a more readable and editable structure, the use of a XML format, and the preservation of whitespace and comments for better organization. The new format is minimalistic, optimizing performance for faster load times, and reduces merge conflicts in version control. It also ensures compatibility with older Visual Studio versions and aligns with certain MSBuild conventions for smoother integration with other tools.\nHere’s a detailed look at these enhancements:\nHuman-Readable and Editable: The new solution file format is designed with clarity in mind, making it easy for developers to read and modify project configurations. This eliminates much of the confusion and errors that arose from manually editing complex files.\nStandardized XML Format: We’ve moved away from a proprietary format and adopted XML for the solution file structure. XML is widely understood, offering flexibility and standardization for greater ease of use.\nWhitespace and Comment Preservation: We now preserve whitespace and comments within solution files when saving them, ensuring your formatting stays intact and helping to maintain an organized file.\nMinimalistic Footprint: The new format adopts sensible defaults, keeping the solution file minimal and optimizing performance. This leads to efficient use of resources, even for large solutions.\nReduced Merge Conflicts: By simplifying the file structure, we’ve reduced the likelihood of merge conflicts in version control systems. This means fewer headaches when collaborating with teammates and easier management of changes.\nCompatibility with Older Visual Studio Versions: We’ve ensured compatibility with Visual Studio Dev 17.14, allowing a smooth transition between the old and new file formats without disrupting your workflow.\nAlignment with MSBuild: The new format aligns with certain MSBuild conventions, which enhances its integration with other tools and platforms, ensuring smoother interoperability.\nTo give you a glimpse into the simplicity of the new .SLNX format, here’s an example:\n<Solution>\r\n<Project Path=\"DotNetMonitorWebApp\\DotNetMonitorWebApp.csproj\" />\r\n</Solution>\r\n\nTo save a solution in the new file format, select the solution node in Solution Explorer, then go to File -> Save Solution As… and choose the “XML Solution File (*.SLNX)” format. The solution will then be saved as a .SLNX file.\n\nTo open a .SLNX file, use the File -> Open command and select the .SLNX file. Note that Visual Studio is not registered as the default handler for .SLNX files, so they won’t open in Visual Studio by default.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nIf you have questions about or are curious to learn more about the format and our plans, have a read of the FAQ section below.\nWhat is a solution file?\nA Visual Studio solution file (.SLN extension) is essential for organizing and managing multiple projects within Visual Studio. It acts as a container that maintains references between projects, build configurations, and other settings, defining how the solution is structured, and which projects are involved.\nWhat support is available for the .SLNX format across different tools and environments?\nWe are currently working on providing support for the. SLNX format across various tools and environments. Here’s what you can expect:\nMSBuild Support: MSBuild now fully supports the .SLNX format, enabling seamless integration with the .NET and C++ build systems. This support allows for efficient building, adding, and removing projects within .SLNX files using MSBuild commands.\n.NET CLI Support: The .NET CLI has been updated to handle .SLNX files, providing consistent experience for managing solutions directly from the command line.\nC# Dev Kit Support: The C# Dev Kit for VS Code now fully supports the .SLNX format, making it easier to work with solution files within the VS Code environment.\nWhat about third-party tool support?\nThe .SLNX file format is designed for wide adoption, but we recommend waiting until it’s more finalized before fully adopting it.\nIf you’re using tools that rely on either the .SLN or .SLNX file formats, we have\ndeveloped an open source serializer that supports both formats: vs-solutionpersistence.\nCan I edit .SLNX files without unloading?\nLike .SLN files, .SLNX files must be unloaded to be edited in Visual Studio. However, we don’t anticipate many cases where manual editing will be\nnecessary. If you’d like to see support for editing without unloading, we\nencourage you to upvote the community request.\nWhat about solution filters?\nSolution filters (.SLNf files), which help improve load and run times, will\ncontinue to work with the new .SLNX format — but keep in mind that filter files are tied to a specific solution file. If you migrate your solution from .SLN to\n.SLNX, you’ll need to update the filter file to reference the new .SLNX file, otherwise it will still try to open the old .SLN file.\nWill extensions continue to support. SLNX?\nWe designed the .SLNX file format to be transparent to extensions. Existing\nVisual Studio APIs that work with .SLN files should continue to work without\nrequiring changes. However, if your extension directly edits solution files, it will need to support both .SLN and .SLNX formats. To learn more about working with solution files in extensions, we recommend checking out the vs-solutionpersistence library, which provides useful APIs for solution file manipulation\nHow do I migrate from the old .SLN format to .SLNX?\nMigrating from the traditional .SLN format to the new .SLNX format is simple, and there are two ways to do it:\nUsing the .NET CLI (for .NET projects)\nFor .NET developers, you can migrate your solution using the following command:\ndotnet SLN <YourSolutionFile.SLN> migrate \nReplace <YourSolutionFile.SLN> with the actual name of your solution file. This command will generate a .SLNX file from your existing .SLN file.\nUsing Visual Studio (recommended for all languages)\nOnce the .SLNX feature is enabled, you can save your solution in the new format directly from Visual Studio — this method works for all supported project types, including C++, Python, JS/TS, and others.\nTo save in the new format:\nRight-click the solution node in Solution Explorer.\nSelect File -> Save Solution As….\nIn the file type dropdown, choose Xml Solution File (*.SLNX).\nClick Save.\nCan I have both .SLN and .SLNX files in the same repo? What’s the best practice for teams where some clients still use .SLN and others want to move to .SLNX?\nWe strongly recommend not having both .SLN and .SLNX files in the same repository. This can cause issues such as:\nCommands like dotnet SLN will not automatically detect the correct solution file.\nKeeping both files manually in sync can be error-prone and lead to confusion across teams.\nIf you absolutely need to maintain both for compatibility reasons (e.g., during a phased migration), consider using a sync tool like this one: dotnet-SLN-sync, which helps automatically keep .SLN and .SLNX files aligned.\nHowever, the recommended best practice is to coordinate the transition with all clients and move fully to .SLNX once the entire team or organization is ready.\nDisclaimer: The dotnet-sln-sync tool is a community-developed project and is not maintained or supported by Microsoft. Please use it at your discretion.\nWill file globbing be supported?\nThe current solution design lists all projects and their locations directly in the solution file. This approach allows Visual Studio to begin loading projects almost immediately.\nSupporting globbing, would require scanning the file system and evaluating potentially complex patterns to identify matching projects. Especially for larger repositories, this additional step can significantly slow down the loading process which is why globbing is not currently supported.\nFor those unfamiliar, globbing refers to pattern matching used to dynamically resolve file paths, commonly seen in many build systems and tools. You can read more about this concept here.\nWhy did you choose XML for .SLNX?\nWe selected XML because it’s a widely used format, and it’s the same format used by project files. XML in project files supports powerful evaluation and execution capabilities, but we want to keep .SLNX simple for now. We’re focused on maintaining the basic functionality like .SLN while keeping things straightforward.\nWhat are the minimum supported tooling versions for building with >SLNX format, and what scenarios are currently unsupported?\nTo build with the .SLNX format:\nIf you’re building with .NET, ensure the project’s global.json is set to a minimum of .NET 9.0.200 SDK.\nIf you’re building with MSBuild, make sure your build tools are using Visual Studio or Build Tools for Visual Studio version 17.13 or later.\nLooking Ahead: Your Feedback Is Key\nYour feedback shapes the future of Visual Studio, and we truly appreciate the time you take to share it.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Debugging complex programs often feels like navigating a labyrinth of threads and stack traces. The challenge of understanding thread behaviors and tracing issues can be daunting, leading to longer development times and increased frustration. But now, there’s a solution that simplifies this process—introducing AI-powered thread summaries in Parallel Stacks Window  with Visual Studio.\nTo address these challenges, Visual Studio introduces two AI-powered features that make debugging more intuitive: thread summaries and app summarization. These enhancements bring clarity to your debugging workflow by providing concise explanations of thread activity and interactive AI-driven assistance.\nAI-generated thread summaries\nUnderstanding what each thread is doing at any given moment is crucial when working with parallel execution. The auto summaries feature in Parallel Stacks Window helps developers quickly gain context by generating AI-powered summaries for each thread. Instead of manually analyzing individual stack frames, you can now get a high-level overview at a glance.\nWhen you open the Parallel Stacks Window, these summaries appear at the top of each thread. These summaries provide a high-level overview of each thread’s current activity, helping you quickly grasp their purpose and status.\n\nApp Summarization with Copilot\nTaking AI assistance a step further, the app summarization feature in Parallel Stacks Window enables developers to interactively explore and resolve debugging challenges with Copilot Chat. This feature doesn’t just summarize— it allows you to ask questions, get explanations, and receive AI-powered suggestions tailored to the debugging context.\nInstead of just presenting raw call stacks, this integration provides clear overviews of each thread’s actions, potential issues, and fixes. This results in a more intuitive approach to multi-threaded debugging, significantly reducing the time needed to understand and resolve complex thread interactions.\n\nTo use this feature, simply click the “summarize” button at the top of the Parallel Stacks Window. This will open the Copilot Chat on the side, preloaded with relevant thread context. You can then engage in an interactive, AI-powered conversation to resolve common threading issues such as deadlocks and race conditions while optimizing your threading model for better efficiency and reliability.Bottom of Form\nBy seamlessly combining parallel stack insights with Copilot Chat’s app summaries, Visual Studio streamlines your debugging workflow, empowering you to diagnose, understand, and address threading issues with greater confidence and speed.\nTry It Out\nBoth AI-generated thread summaries and app summarization aim to reduce debugging time and improve developer productivity. Whether you need a high-level overview or an in-depth analysis of a thread, these features provide the clarity and intelligence required to navigate complex debugging scenarios.\nPlease try it out and give us some feedback. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable as we strive to make Visual Studio the best development environment for you.\nThank you for helping us make Visual Studio better every day.\nThe post Make more sense of multithreaded debugging appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I’m very excited to share some great news with you! Starting today, if you’re a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriber, you can get free access to Cloud Academy from QA—no trial, and no credit card required. This exclusive benefit is included with your Visual Studio subscription and provides 12 months of free access to Cloud Academy. Act fast—this is a limited-time offer. Just log in to the Visual Studio subscriptions portal at my.visualstudio.com and activate your free plan.\n\nWhat is Cloud Academy?\nCloud Academy, now part of QA, is a premier learning platform that helps developers and IT pros master cloud technologies. QA acquired Cloud Academy to expand its robust training offerings, bringing even more hands-on, outcome-based learning experiences to users worldwide.\nMaster Azure with Hands-on Learning\nI know how important hands-on experience is when it comes to mastering cloud skills, and this benefit is packed with practical learning opportunities:\n221 Hands-on Labs\n330 Lessons\n111 Exams\n23 Certification Exam Prep Courses\nLearn Your Way\nOne of my favorite features of this platform is how flexible the learning options are. You can choose the style that fits you best:\nGuided Labs: Follow step-by-step instructions to complete tasks in a live Azure environment.\nChallenge Labs: If you’re confident in your skills, jump right into a challenge without instructions and validate your work by submitting your code.\nCloud Sandboxes: Want to experiment? Practice freely in a safe, pre-configured Azure environment—no need to worry about using up your own Azure credits!\nSmarter Learning with AI-Powered Smart Assessments & Ela: Your Expert Learning Assistant\nAnother standout feature is Ela, your Expert Learning Assistant, and Smart Assessments—and I think you’re going to love it. Instead of working through lessons you’ve already mastered, these AI-driven assessments baseline your knowledge and adjust your learning path accordingly. That means less time reviewing what you already know and more time building new skills that matter.\nMeet Ela: Your AI-Powered Learning Assistant\nI’m really excited about this—Cloud Academy now includes Ela, an AI-driven learning assistant designed to enhance your self-paced learning experience. Ela is trained exclusively on QA-authored content, making it a trusted source for guidance whenever you need it.\nWhat makes Ela special? Unlike basic AI chatbots, Ela is built with real-world expertise to provide tutor-style support. Whether you’re looking for quick revision, knowledge checks, explanations of complex topics, or even lab-specific assistance, Ela is available 24/7 to help you along the way.\nHere are just a few of Ela’s standout capabilities:\nSummarize: Quickly review key takeaways from course content for faster learning.\nTest: Reinforce your understanding with knowledge checks before moving forward.\nExplain: Get clear, practical explanations that connect theory to application.\nEla isn’t just limited to courses—she also provides hands-on lab support, helping you troubleshoot code, find bugs, and clarify lab tasks.\nThis is a game-changer for learners who want real-time, expert-level support while mastering Azure.\nGet Ready for Certification\nIf you’ve been thinking about getting Azure certified, this benefit will help you get there faster. With 23 certification prep courses, you’ll go beyond just memorization and apply what you learn through a mix of lessons, hands-on labs, quizzes, and exams.\n\nActivate Your Free Access Today\nI can’t wait for you to try this out! Redeem your free Cloud Academy access now by logging into my.visualstudio.com and activating your license. Remember, this is limited time offer so act now before it’s gone.\nAt Microsoft, we’re passionate about helping developers grow their skills and advance their careers. Everyone learns differently, and we know that access to the right tools and resources makes all the difference. Cloud Academy is another opportunity to expand your Azure expertise and bring valuable cloud solutions to your company—whether that’s improving efficiency, driving innovation, or scaling your applications to meet the demands of the future.\nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub\nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions.\nLet me know your thoughts about our VS subscriber benefits—you can reach me on LinkedIn!\nThe post Unlock Free Access to Cloud Academy: A New Benefit for Visual Studio Subscribers appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

저도 한때는 절전 모드가 편리하다고 생각했어요. 하지만 사용하면 할수록 PC가 느려지고, 배터리도 예상보다 빨리 닳는 걸 깨닫고 나서 완전히 생각을 바꿨죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">윈도우의 절전 모드는 겉보기엔 편리하지만, 장기적으로 보면 여러 가지 문제가 생길 수 있습니다. 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 시스템 충돌 등 다양한 이유로 저는 절전 모드를 피하는 편이에요. 그렇다면, 왜 절전 모드가 문제가 될까요? 그리고 대안은 무엇일까요?</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  최신 PC는 부팅 속도가 빠르다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">예전에는 PC를 완전히 종료하면 다시 켤 때 시간이 오래 걸렸어요. 하지만 요즘은 SSD가 대중화되면서 부팅 속도가 크게 개선됐습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">SSD를 사용하면 부팅 시간이 평균 10초 내외로 줄어들어요. 게다가 윈도우의 '빠른 시작(Fast Startup)' 기능을 활성화하면 더욱 빠르게 사용할 수 있죠. 절전 모드를 쓰지 않아도 충분히 빠른 부팅이 가능하니, 굳이 사용할 이유가 적어집니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>⚠️ 절전 모드가 성능 저하를 유발할 수 있다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드는 PC를 완전히 끄는 것이 아니라, 메모리에 현재 상태를 저장한 채 최소한의 전력을 유지하는 방식이에요. 그래서 계속 절전 모드만 반복해서 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드에서 실행되는 프로그램이 많아져 PC 속도가 느려질 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히, 윈도우 업데이트 같은 중요한 작업은 시스템이 완전히 종료될 때 진행되는 경우가 많아서, 절전 모드를 너무 자주 사용하면 업데이트가 원활하게 이루어지지 않을 수도 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  배터리가 예상보다 빨리 닳는다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"노트북을 절전 모드로 두고 가방에 넣었는데, 몇 시간 후에 보니 배터리가 절반 이상 닳아 있었어요.\" 이런 경험 해보신 적 있나요?</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드는 전력을 완전히 차단하는 것이 아니라, 메모리를 유지하기 위해 계속 전력을 소비해요. 특히 'Modern Standby' 기능이 활성화된 상태에서는 네트워크 연결을 유지하면서도 절전 모드가 지속되기 때문에 배터리 소모가 심해질 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  시스템 프로세스가 중단될 가능성이 있다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">컴퓨터를 완전히 종료하면 실행 중인 프로세스들이 정상적으로 종료되지만, 절전 모드에서는 그렇지 않습니다. 작업 중이던 프로그램이 강제로 중단되면서 오류가 발생할 가능성이 높아지는 거죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히, 포토샵이나 프리미어 프로 같은 전문 소프트웨어를 사용하는 경우, 절전 모드를 반복하면 프로젝트 파일이 손상될 수도 있어요. 이런 프로그램을 사용한다면 절전 모드보다는 완전 종료 또는 최대 절전 모드를 사용하는 것이 더 안전합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  하드웨어 부담과 비정상적인 작동</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드를 지속적으로 사용하면 하드웨어에도 부담이 갈 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 노트북을 절전 모드 상태로 가방에 넣어두면 내부적으로 열이 발생하면서 장기적으로 부품에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">또한, 배터리는 충전과 방전을 반복할수록 수명이 줄어드는데, 절전 모드를 자주 사용하면 배터리가 지속적으로 활성화된 상태가 되어 수명 감소가 빨라질 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>✅ 절전 모드 대신 사용할 수 있는 대안</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드를 꼭 사용해야 할까요?

        "contentSnippet": "윈도우 PC에서 '절전 모드'를 자주 사용하면 성능 저하, 배터리 문제, 하드웨어 부담 등의 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 절전 모드 대신 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 활용하는 것이 더 나은 선택일 수 있습니다.\n\n\n \n\"PC를 켤 때 기다리는 게 싫어서 절전 모드를 자주 사용했는데, 오히려 성능이 나빠지는 느낌이에요.\" 이런 경험 있으신가요? 저도 한때는 절전 모드가 편리하다고 생각했어요. 하지만 사용하면 할수록 PC가 느려지고, 배터리도 예상보다 빨리 닳는 걸 깨닫고 나서 완전히 생각을 바꿨죠.\n \n윈도우의 절전 모드는 겉보기엔 편리하지만, 장기적으로 보면 여러 가지 문제가 생길 수 있습니다. 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 시스템 충돌 등 다양한 이유로 저는 절전 모드를 피하는 편이에요. 그렇다면, 왜 절전 모드가 문제가 될까요? 그리고 대안은 무엇일까요?\n \n  최신 PC는 부팅 속도가 빠르다\n예전에는 PC를 완전히 종료하면 다시 켤 때 시간이 오래 걸렸어요. 하지만 요즘은 SSD가 대중화되면서 부팅 속도가 크게 개선됐습니다.\n \nSSD를 사용하면 부팅 시간이 평균 10초 내외로 줄어들어요. 게다가 윈도우의 '빠른 시작(Fast Startup)' 기능을 활성화하면 더욱 빠르게 사용할 수 있죠. 절전 모드를 쓰지 않아도 충분히 빠른 부팅이 가능하니, 굳이 사용할 이유가 적어집니다.\n \n⚠️ 절전 모드가 성능 저하를 유발할 수 있다\n절전 모드는 PC를 완전히 끄는 것이 아니라, 메모리에 현재 상태를 저장한 채 최소한의 전력을 유지하는 방식이에요. 그래서 계속 절전 모드만 반복해서 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드에서 실행되는 프로그램이 많아져 PC 속도가 느려질 수 있어요.\n \n특히, 윈도우 업데이트 같은 중요한 작업은 시스템이 완전히 종료될 때 진행되는 경우가 많아서, 절전 모드를 너무 자주 사용하면 업데이트가 원활하게 이루어지지 않을 수도 있습니다.\n \n  배터리가 예상보다 빨리 닳는다\n\"노트북을 절전 모드로 두고 가방에 넣었는데, 몇 시간 후에 보니 배터리가 절반 이상 닳아 있었어요.\" 이런 경험 해보신 적 있나요?\n \n절전 모드는 전력을 완전히 차단하는 것이 아니라, 메모리를 유지하기 위해 계속 전력을 소비해요. 특히 'Modern Standby' 기능이 활성화된 상태에서는 네트워크 연결을 유지하면서도 절전 모드가 지속되기 때문에 배터리 소모가 심해질 수 있습니다.\n \n  시스템 프로세스가 중단될 가능성이 있다\n컴퓨터를 완전히 종료하면 실행 중인 프로세스들이 정상적으로 종료되지만, 절전 모드에서는 그렇지 않습니다. 작업 중이던 프로그램이 강제로 중단되면서 오류가 발생할 가능성이 높아지는 거죠.\n특히, 포토샵이나 프리미어 프로 같은 전문 소프트웨어를 사용하는 경우, 절전 모드를 반복하면 프로젝트 파일이 손상될 수도 있어요. 이런 프로그램을 사용한다면 절전 모드보다는 완전 종료 또는 최대 절전 모드를 사용하는 것이 더 안전합니다.\n \n  하드웨어 부담과 비정상적인 작동\n절전 모드를 지속적으로 사용하면 하드웨어에도 부담이 갈 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 노트북을 절전 모드 상태로 가방에 넣어두면 내부적으로 열이 발생하면서 장기적으로 부품에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.\n또한, 배터리는 충전과 방전을 반복할수록 수명이 줄어드는데, 절전 모드를 자주 사용하면 배터리가 지속적으로 활성화된 상태가 되어 수명 감소가 빨라질 수 있어요.\n \n✅ 절전 모드 대신 사용할 수 있는 대안\n절전 모드를 꼭 사용해야 할까요? 더 좋은 방법이 있습니다.\n \n1️⃣ 완전 종료(Shut Down)\nPC를 장시간 사용하지 않을 때는 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 깔끔한 방법이에요. 이렇게 하면 시스템이 완전히 리셋되면서 불필요한 프로세스가 종료되고, 성능이 최적화됩니다.\n \n2️⃣ 최대 절전 모드(Hibernate)\n노트북을 잠시 닫아야 하지만 배터리를 아끼고 싶다면, 최대 절전 모드를 활용해 보세요. 이 모드는 현재 작업 상태를 저장한 후 PC를 완전히 꺼버리기 때문에 전력 소모가 없습니다. 그리고 다시 켜면 원래 작업하던 상태로 바로 돌아올 수 있어요.\n \n3️⃣ 빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 활성화\n윈도우의 빠른 시작 기능을 활성화하면 부팅 속도를 더 빠르게 할 수 있어요. 설정 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n\n제어판(Control Panel) > 전원 옵션(Power Options)으로 이동\n왼쪽 메뉴에서 전원 버튼 작동 설정(Choose what the power button does) 선택\n빠른 시작 켜기(Turn on fast startup) 옵션 활성화 후 저장\n이 기능을 활용하면 절전 모드를 사용하지 않아도 빠르게 PC를 켤 수 있습니다.\n \n✍️ 결론\n절전 모드는 편리한 기능이지만, 장기적으로 보면 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 하드웨어 부담 등의 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 그래서 저는 절전 모드를 거의 사용하지 않고, 대신 완전 종료, 최대 절전 모드, 빠른 시작 기능을 활용하고 있어요.\n여러분도 혹시 절전 모드 때문에 불편을 겪고 계신가요? 그렇다면 오늘부터라도 더 효율적인 방법을 사용해 보세요!  \n  Q&A\n1. 절전 모드를 사용하면 배터리가 빨리 닳는 이유는?\n절전 모드에서도 메모리를 유지하기 위해 일정량의 전력을 계속 사용하기 때문입니다. 특히 최신 윈도우 노트북은 네트워크 연결까지 유지하려고 하면서 배터리 소모가 더 심해질 수 있습니다.\n2. 절전 모드 대신 가장 좋은 대안은?\nPC를 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 하지만 작업 상태를 유지해야 한다면 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 절전 모드보다 훨씬 효과적입니다.\n3. 절전 모드를 계속 사용하면 성능이 저하될 수 있나요?\n네, 절전 모드를 반복 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드 프로세스가 제대로 종료되지 않아 PC가 느려질 수 있습니다.\n4. 빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 기능을 활성화하면 절전 모드가 필요 없을까요?\n네, 빠른 시작 기능을 켜면 부팅 속도가 절전 모드에서 깨어나는 것과 거의 비슷한 수준으로 빨라지므로 절전 모드를 굳이 사용할 필요가 없습니다.\n5. 노트북을 이동할 때 어떤 전원 옵션을 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\n가방에 넣고 이동할 때는 반드시 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 절전 모드를 사용하면 내부 발열이 발생할 수 있어요.\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드를 사용하면 배터리가 빨리 닳는 이유는?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"절전 모드에서도 메모리를 유지하기 위해 일정량의 전력을 계속 사용하기 때문입니다. 특히 최신 윈도우 노트북은 네트워크 연결까지 유지하려고 하면서 배터리 소모가 더 심해질 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드 대신 가장 좋은 대안은?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"PC를 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 하지만 작업 상태를 유지해야 한다면 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 절전 모드보다 훨씬 효과적입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드를 계속 사용하면 성능이 저하될 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 절전 모드를 반복 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드 프로세스가 제대로 종료되지 않아 PC가 느려질 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 기능을 활성화하면 절전 모드가 필요 없을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 빠른 시작 기능을 켜면 부팅 속도가 절전 모드에서 깨어나는 것과 거의 비슷한 수준으로 빨라지므로 절전 모드를 굳이 사용할 필요가 없습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"노트북을 이동할 때 어떤 전원 옵션을 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"가방에 넣고 이동할 때는 반드시 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 절전 모드를 사용하면 내부 발열이 발생할 수 있어요.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

저는 그냥 생각나는 대로 말하던 사람인데 인생을 바꿔준 책입니다.\n6. 토스 Culture Evangelist 김서현이 추천하는\n이본 쉬나드의 《파타고니아, 파도가 칠 때는 서핑을》\n파타고니아라는 기업이 추구하는 경영 방식뿐 아니라 우리가 일과 자연, 그리고 인생을 어떻게 바라봐야 하는지에 대해 깊은 영감을 주는 책이에요. 책을 읽다 보면 파도가 치는 순간을 두려워하기보다 서핑하듯 즐기는 마음가짐을 배우게 됩니다. \n7. 토스 콘텐츠 프로듀서 김창선이 추천하는\n캐롤라인 알렉산더의 《인듀어런스》\n논픽션이 줄 수 있는 최고치의 블록버스터. 세상을 바꾸거나 우주에 가는 일이 아니더라도, 인간답게 견디는 것만으로도 인간이 얼마나 위대한지 알 수 있는 책.\n8. 회계사·B주류경제학 진행자 이재용이 추천하는\n스콧 갤러웨이의 《스콧 교수의 인생 경제학》\n이 책의 원래 제목은 행복의 대수학입니다. 누구보다 성공과 돈을 쫓았던 저자의 인생을 통해 우리의 인생에 대한 가치관도 다시 생각해볼 수 있어요. \n9. 토스 CFO 서현우가 추천하는\n권창섭의 《우리 그런 말 안 써요》\n예고생들의 생활을 담은 시집입니다. 그들의 눈으로 바라보는 세상을 담은 시를 읽다 보면 다른 차원의 공간에 가 있는 느낌이 들어요. 어딘가 치유되는 느낌이 들기도 하고요. 새로운 시기로 나아가는 과정에서 마음의 위로가 필요하다면 추천드립니다. \n10. 머니 트레이너 김경필이 추천하는\n김경필의 《딱 1억만 모읍시다》\n종잣돈 1억 모으기는 재테크의 기본이자 가장 중요한 단계라고 합니다. 하지만 월급으로 먹고살기에도 빠듯한데, 대체 어떻게 모아야 할까요?

(2025년 기준, 경비율은 매년 달라질 수 있어요)\n③ 꼼꼼하게 신고해야 하는 I 유형\n동종 업종과 비교해 소득률이 현저히 낮거나, 세금계산서, 계산서, 신용카드 매출전표 등 정규영수증 없이 지출한 경비가 클 경우에 I 유형으로 분류돼요. 정상적인 범위에서 산출된 세금보다 적은 세금이 계산된 사람에게 안내되는 유형이라고 보면 돼요. 이 유형은 종소세 신고 후 국세청이 직접 사후 검증을 진행하기 때문에 신고할 때 더욱 주의해야 해요.\n④ 전문가의 도움을 받아야 하는 A, B, C, S 유형\nA, B, C 유형은 복식부기대상자예요. 복식부기장부는 모든 수입과 지출을 차변과 대변으로 나눠 기록해 재무제표로 표현하는 방식인데요. 세무 지식이 없다면 작성하기 어려워서 세무사의 도움을 받는 것이 일반적이에요.\n특히 ‘성실신고대상자'인 S 유형은 세무대리인의 성실신고확인서가 필요하기 때문에 납세자가 직접 신고할 수 없어요.\n⑤ 선택지가 있는 V 유형\nV 유형은 지난 한 해 동안 주택 임대 소득이 있는 사업자 중, 임대 소득이 2,000만 원 미만인 경우에 해당돼요. 이 경우, 종합과세와 분리과세 중 선택할 수 있어요. 분리과세를 선택하면 홈택스를 통해 확정신고만 하면 돼서 절차가 비교적 간단하지만, 공제 가능한 비용이 있다면 종합과세가 더 유리할 수도 있어서 둘 중 어떤 방식이 더 나은지 꼼꼼히 따져보는 게 좋아요.\n⑥ 신고 대상이 될 수도 있는 T 유형\nT 유형은 사업자가 아니라 금융소득, 연금소득, 근로소득, 기타소득 등 비사업 소득이 있는 사람이 해당돼요. 보통은 원천징수를 통해 세금이 미리 납부되지만, 소득 금액이 일정 기준을 넘으면 종합소득세 신고를 해야 해요. 예를 들어 이자·배당소득이 2천만 원을 넘는다면 종합소득세 신고 대상이 될 수 있죠.\n⑦ 신고 방식이 다른 Q 유형\nQ 유형은 종교인 소득이 있는 경우 해당돼요. 종교활동비가 아닌 사례금이나 보조금 같은 소득이 발생하면 신고해야 하는데요. 종교인 소득은 사업소득이 아닌 기타소득으로 신고할 수 있기 때문에, 선택하는 방식에 따라 세 부담이 달라질 수 있어요. 본인에게 유리한 방식이 무엇인지 미리 따져보는 게 좋아요.\n⑧ 신고 의무가 없는 R 유형\nR 유형은 종교인 소득은 있지만 납세 의무가 없는 경우예요. 소득세법상 신고 대상에서 제외되는 조건을 충족하면 신고하지 않아도 돼요. 본인이 신고 대상인지 확실하지 않다면, 국세청에 문의해 보는 게 좋아요.\n종합소득세도 할부가 되나요?\n종합소득세 납부 세액이 1,000만 원을 초과한다면, 세금 부담을 줄일 수 있는 ‘분납제도’를 이용할 수 있어요. 납부 세액이 2,000만 원 이하라면 1,000만 원을 초과하는 금액은 나중에 낼 수 있고, 납부 세액이 2,000만 원을 초과하면 절반(50%)을 나눠서 납부할 수 있어요.\n예를 들어, 종합소득세가 1,500만 원이라면 1,000만 원은 기한 내에 납부하고, 나머지 500만 원은 2개월 안에 나눠 낼 수 있는거죠. 다만, 분납 가능한 금액은 정규 납부기한 이후 2개월 안에 반드시 납부해야 한다는 점을 기억해야 해요. 기한을 넘기면 가산세가 부과될 수 있어 오히려 부담이 더 커질 수 있거든요.\n납부 세액의 금액과 상관 없이 당장 세금을 낼 여유가 없다면, 신용카드나 체크카드를 이용해 할부로 납부하는 방법도 있어요. 단, 신용카드는 납부 세액의 0.8%, 체크카드는 0.5%의 수수료가 부과되기 때문에 이 점을 고려해서 선택하는 게 좋아요. 카드로 종합소득세를 납부하는 방법은 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}국세청 사이트에서 더 자세하게 확인할 수 있어요.\n종합소득세 신고 안 하면 어떻게 될까요?\n기한 내에 종합소득세 신고를 하지 않으면 원래 내야 할 세금에 가산세까지 추가로 붙을 수 있어요. 가산세는 신고불성실 가산세와 납부불성실 가산세로 나뉘는데요. 신고는 했지만 납부하지 않았다면 납부불성실 가산세만 내면 되지만, 신고조차 하지 않았다면 신고불성실 가산세도 추가로 부담해야 해요.\n정말 바빠서 세금을 챙길 여유가 없더라도, 일단 대략적인 신고서라도 작성해 제출하는 것이 좋아요. 이렇게 하면 신고불성실 가산세를 피할 수 있고, 나중에 여유가 생겼을 때 수정 신고도 가능하기 때문이에요. 종소세 신고를 하지 않을 경우 어떻게 되는지 더 알고 싶다면 이 아티클에서 확인할 수 있어요.\n내가 놓친 세금 환급액은 없을까요?\n아무리 꼼꼼하게 종합소득세를 신고해왔더라도, 소소한 세액공제나 감면 혜택 등을 빠뜨린 적이 있다면 세금 환급액이 있을 수 있어요. 다행히 종합소득세는 최대 5년까지 ‘기한 후 신고’가 가능하니, 혹시라도 놓친 환급액이 있는지 확인해보는 게 좋아요.\n토스에서는 내가 받을 수 있는 환급액이 있는지 쉽고 빠르게 확인할 수 있어요. 영영 못 받을 뻔한 돈을 찾을 수도 있으니, 지금 바로 아래 버튼을 눌러 확인해보세요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현",
