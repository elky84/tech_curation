        "content:encodedSnippet": "One of the most popular posts on the /devops subreddit says, “After 24 years in IT, I’m done. I don’t want to debug another YAML file. This is not how I foresee spending my life.”\nDevOps can be frustrating, and the 3,000+ people who upvoted that post clearly agree. It doesn’t have to be this painful though. With the right tools and workflows, many of the struggles that DevOps engineers face daily can be simplified or even eliminated.\nHere are eight common DevOps problems and practical ways to solve them using GoLand, the JetBrains IDE for development in Go and DevOps work.\nWhy GoLand for DevOps?\nDevOps engineers traditionally have to manage a wide range of various tools, all with their own complex setups and features. Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Helm: no wonder articles like 73 Most Useful DevOps Tools in 2025 exist.\nAccording to the Developer Ecosystem: Data Playground, Go has become the go-to language for DevOps work, with over 760,000 DevOps engineers using it as their primary programming language. This makes sense, since Kubernetes and most modern DevOps tools are built in Go. When you need custom scripts, CLIs, or extensions, Go is the natural choice.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoLand provides direct access to the terminal, Kubernetes, Docker, and HTTP Client. The goal is to help engineers debug, deploy, and manage infrastructure faster, with less chaos and more confidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at the specific problems that make DevOps work frustrating and how to fix them.\nProblem 1: Fixing broken Kubernetes deployments takes too many steps\nImagine deploying a new version of a service, but the container image itself is broken. The pod starts, it immediately fails, and you get errors in the logs.\nIn a typical workflow, you’d switch between several tools:\nCheck the logs with kubectl logs\nEdit the deployment manifest in a text editor\nReapply the manifest with kubectl apply\nCheck the pod status again in kubectl get pods to confirm everything is healthy\nThis constant switching between terminal, editor, and Docker tooling slows down recovery and makes it harder to stay focused on solving the issue.\nSolution: Fix issues in GoLand\nGoLand streamlines this entire troubleshooting loop inside one workspace. For example, imagine deploying a Go backend service connected to a Postgres database, where the pod crashes immediately upon startup. In GoLand, the process is much simpler because you can:\nOpen the logs directly in GoLand’s Kubernetes log viewer and spot the error – in this case, a misconfigured port number.\nEdit the deployment YAML in the IDE, with schema validation to avoid typos.\nReapply the fixed manifest directly from the Kubernetes integration.\nConfirm the pod starts correctly by watching its status turn green in the resources view.\nRe-check the logs inline to verify that the application is now running and connected to Postgres without errors.\nWith GoLand, you don’t have to jump between terminal, editor, and dashboards. Diagnosing, fixing, and redeploying all happen inside the IDE, helping you resolve issues quickly and keep services online.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2: Manual and error-prone Kubernetes secret management\nManaging secrets in Kubernetes often requires a tedious workflow: run kubectl to fetch the secret, decode it with base64, make the necessary edits, re-encode it, and then apply it back. These steps are easy to mess up, especially when responding to incidents and emergencies.\nSolution: Edit secrets directly in GoLand\nGoLand’s bundled Kubernetes plugin lets you open secrets securely as plain text and edit them directly. No encoding steps, no command line switching: Simply open the secret, make your changes, and save them.\nAnd because this functionality is built and maintained by JetBrains, you can rely on the same level of security and quality as the rest of the IDE, without having to depend on unverified third-party plugins.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3: Inefficient Kubernetes context and namespace switching\nMost engineers juggle multiple clusters and namespaces every day. Some resort to external apps like Docker Desktop just to switch the active cluster. Others rely on the terminal, repeatedly running kubectl config use-context and kubectl config set-context --namespace=….\nBoth approaches are repetitive, slow you down, and one wrong command can easily put you in the wrong cluster – something no one wants to happen in production.\nSolution: Switch contexts and namespaces in GoLand\nGoLand’s Kubernetes UI makes context and namespace switching faster and safer. You can now switch between them directly from a dropdown in the IDE, with clear visual indicators showing the active cluster and namespace.\nThis reduces the chance of accidentally applying changes to the wrong environment and eliminates repetitive terminal commands.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 4: Too much DevOps time is wasted on repetitive tasks\nMany DevOps tasks can be quite repetitive: writing Terraform templates, piecing together long cloud CLI commands, parsing JSON files, or combing through endless pod logs.\nThese tasks aren’t complex, but they are time-consuming, tedious, and take attention away from solving real problems.\nSolution: Let AI Assistant handle the repetitive work\nAI Assistant, which comes with GoLand (and other JetBrains IDEs) can help engineers offload mundane tasks so they can focus on what matters. Some use cases include:\nGenerating infrastructure code such as Terraform snippets or YAML manifests instead of writing boilerplate by hand.\nCreating cloud CLI commands and scripts on demand, e.g. finding AWS autoscaling groups and ECS services across regions, scaling them up, and triggering new deployments with a single prompt.\nAnalyzing logs automatically, highlighting suspicious entries, frequent errors, or summaries.\nHandling JSON parsing and data transformations automatically – tasks that would otherwise require writing ad-hoc scripts\nBy delegating routine work to AI, engineers save time on the “boring stuff” and keep their focus on solving critical incidents, improving infrastructure, and shipping value to users.\nUnlike using external AI tools in a separate window, GoLand’s AI Assistant keeps everything in one place, helping you avoid context switching.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 5: Managing infrastructure as code across different tools\nWorking with infrastructure as code means bouncing between different formats and technologies constantly – Terraform for provisioning, Helm charts for packaging and templating, and Kubernetes YAML for deployment.\nWhile you can add plugins in other editors, support is often inconsistent. Autocompletion may work for one tool but not another, validation can be inconsistent, and switching between terminal and editor tabs quickly gets messy.\nSolution: First-class support for Terraform, Helm, and Kubernetes in GoLand\nGoLand provides native, consistent support for the key technologies DevOps teams rely on:\nTerraform: advanced autocompletion, on-the-fly validation, and navigation between resources.\nHelm charts: templating support, syntax highlighting, and smart YAML editing inside templates.\nKubernetes manifests: schema validation, quick fixes, and integration with the Kubernetes plugin for applying actions directly.\nInstead of piecing together several plugins, you get a single environment where IaC files, CLI workflows, and cluster operations all work together out of the box.\n\n\n\n\nProblem 6: Difficulty tracking logs across services during incidents\nWhen something breaks in Kubernetes, logs are often the first place to look. Without centralized log aggregation, engineers use kubectl logs combined with grep or have to copy-paste outputs into a local editor.\nWith multiple pods and a high log volume, it’s easy to miss critical lines, especially when you’re searching for patterns like status codes or error messages under time pressure.\nSolution: Stream and filter logs directly in GoLand\nThe Kubernetes plugin that is bundled in GoLand provides a built-in log viewer that makes troubleshooting faster. With it, you can:\nStream logs from pods directly in the IDE.\nUse search, filtering, and highlighting to quickly spot relevant entries.\nParse structured logs (like JSON) and filter by fields: For example, surface only rows with status values greater than 500\nThis is especially valuable for teams that don’t yet use centralized log collectors (like Loki or Kibana).\n\n\n\n\nProblem 7: Limited visibility of CI/CD pipeline configs\nCI/CD pipelines get complicated quickly. Editing .gitlab-ci.yml or GitHub Actions workflows in plain text editors or web interfaces makes it easy to miss issues. Maybe a variable name has a typo, or indentation is wrong, and you only discover it after the pipeline fails, or a stage doesn’t exist, and you try to reference to it later.\nSolution: CI/CD pipeline editing with validation in GoLand\nGoLand helps catch issues before they hit runners. When editing GitHub Actions or GitLab CI configs, you get:\nAutocompletion for jobs, stages, and variables.\nInline documentation right in the editor.\nSchema validation highlighting mistakes as you type.\nCompared to terminal editing or web interfaces, GoLand provides immediate feedback, so you can spot mistakes before they waste a pipeline run.\n\n\n\n\nFor TeamCity users, the TeamCity plugin lets you browse builds, check logs, and connect configs directly to the IDE.\nProblem 8: Inconvenient tracking of multiple port forwards\nAccessing internal services in Kubernetes usually means running kubectl port-forward pod-name 8080:80 from the terminal. It works but ties up a terminal session and makes tracking active forwards difficult. It’s easy to forget stopping processes or mix up port numbers.\nSolution: Port forwarding made easier in GoLand\nGoLand’s Kubernetes integration handles port forwarding directly from the IDE. Right-click a pod or service to create a port-forward with a few clicks. Starting from GoLand 2025.3, it’ll also be possible to do it from the editor.\nActive forwards are shown in the IDE, so you always know which services are accessible and on which ports. As a result, your terminal stays available for other tasks.\nThis makes common scenarios faster and easier to manage, such as testing service endpoints locally, validating patches, or investigating incidents without public exposure.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDevOps doesn’t have to feel like debugging YAML files forever. While toolchain complexity isn’t going away, having the right IDE can be a huge help when managing all the numerous tools that DevOps engineers have to handle daily.\nGoLand consolidates many common DevOps workflows into a single environment, reducing context switching and making infrastructure work more manageable. Think of it as a cockpit for your infrastructure: everything you need to see and control, without leaving your seat.\nReady to spend less time juggling tools and more time solving actual problems?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "IntelliJ IDEA has great support for debugging Java and Kotlin applications. But if you are building Spring Boot applications, you may want to access Spring components along with their metadata. That’s where the Spring Debugger plugin comes in. It makes life easier by letting you explore and use the entire Spring ApplicationContext right from your debugger.\nLet’s dive into how this powerful plugin can revolutionize your debugging workflow.\n\n\nSpring Debugger: ApplicationContext at Your Fingertips \n\n\n\nBeyond the Scope: Access Any Spring Bean\nImagine you are building a bookmarks management application using Spring Boot and you have a Spring bean BookmarkService with createBookmark() method as follows:\n@Service\npublic class BookmarkService {\n   private final BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n   private final CategoryService categoryService;\n\n   public BookmarkService(BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository,\n                          CategoryService categoryService) {\n       this.bookmarkRepository = bookmarkRepository;\n       this.categoryService = categoryService;\n   }\n\n   @Transactional\n   public Bookmark createBookmark(CreateBookmarkCmd cmd) {\n       var bookmark = new Bookmark(cmd.title(), cmd.url());\n       if(cmd.categoryName() != null) {\n           Category category = categoryService.findByName(cmd.categoryName()).orElse(null);\n           if (category == null) {\n               category = categoryService.createCategory(new Category(cmd.categoryName()));\n           }\n           bookmark.setCategory(category);\n       }\n       bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark);\n       return bookmark;\n   }\n}\nThe BookmarkService has BookmarkRepository and CategoryService beans injected. While creating a bookmark, we first check if there is a Category exists with the given name. If not, we will create a new Category and then save Bookmark.\nThe CategoryService is also a Spring bean with findByName(String) method as follows:\n@Service\npublic class CategoryService {\n   private final CategoryRepository categoryRepository;\n\n   public CategoryService(CategoryRepository categoryRepository) {\n       this.categoryRepository = categoryRepository;\n   }\n\n   @Cacheable(\"category-by-name\")\n   public Optional<Category> findByName(String name) {\n       return categoryRepository.findByNameEqualsIgnoreCase(name);\n   }\n}\nThe findByName() method is annotated with @Cacheable(\"category-by-name\") to cache the method result so that if you call this method with the same input it will return the cached result instead of executing the method logic again.\nNow, Imagine you’re debugging create bookmark use case. You hit a breakpoint in BookmarkService.createBookmark() method. Usually, you can access objects within the current scope, such as bookmarkRepository, bookmark, or categoryService. \nBut what if you need to inspect or interact with a bean that isn’t directly injected into your current class. For example, you may want to clear existing data or insert new data into the database by using a repository directly.\nLet’s say while debugging BookmarkService.createBookmark() method, we would like to temporarily delete all the categories using CategoryRepository.deleteAll()? Usually, you’d be out of luck.\nThis is where the Spring Debugger plugin shines. It allows you to access any Spring bean that exists within your ApplicationContext. Simply start typing the bean name into the expression input box, and the plugin will show matching beans. You can then invoke any methods on them, like calling categoryRepository.findAll() method and you can view the result. \n\n\n\n\nThis capability extends your debugging reach far beyond the immediate scope.\nManipulate Application State On-the-Fly\nConsider a common scenario: you have a service method, like CategoryService.findByName(), that caches its results. If you’re debugging an issue related to this method and call it repeatedly with the same input, the breakpoint won’t be hit because the results are served from the cache.\nTraditionally, you might need to restart your application or temporarily disable caching to force the breakpoint to hit. With the Spring Debugger plugin, there’s a much more elegant solution.\nYou can directly access the cacheManager bean from your ApplicationContext. Inspect the available caches, find the specific cache (e.g., category-by-name), and then invoke the invalidate() method on it.\n\n\n\n\nAfter invalidating the cache, when you resume execution, the breakpoint in CategoryService will now be hit because there’s no entry in the cache for that name.\nThis demonstrates the incredible power to invoke any method on any Spring bean to dynamically control and debug your application’s flow.\nAccess Core Spring Components and Properties\nSometimes we may get tricky problems due to configuration issues or misunderstanding of conventions. While debugging such issues, we may want to explore the application’s runtime configuration or access low-level components to interact with database or publish application events using ApplicationEventPublisher.\nThe utility of the Spring Debugger plugin isn’t limited to your custom beans. It also provides direct access to core Spring components that are part of your ApplicationContext:\nEntityManager: If you’re using JPA, you can directly access the entityManager and invoke any methods on it.\nEnvironment: Gain access to the environment bean, which provides an abstraction to all application properties. You can query specific property values to see their current configuration.\n\n\n\n\nStreamline Your Debugging Workflow and Save Time\nThe ability to access any Spring bean has significant implications for your overall debugging process.\nEliminate Temporary Code Changes: How many times have you temporarily injected a bean, added log statements, or introduced other debugging code, only to have to remove it once the issue is found? With Spring Debugger, you don’t need to make those temporary changes. You can directly access any bean and explore your use case as needed.\nEffortless Test Data Setup: Imagine debugging a scenario that requires specific test data, perhaps an action only an administrator can perform. Instead of logging out, and logging in as an administrator, performing the action, and then returning to your debug flow, you can simply access a service bean directly to insert test data into the database, bypassing complex setup steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, the Spring Debugger plugin empowers you with all the power of the Spring ApplicationContext right at your fingertips while debugging. It significantly enhances your ability to understand, inspect, and manipulate your Spring Boot application’s state, making your debugging sessions more efficient and productive.\nGo ahead and install the Spring Debugger plugin to explore its powers yourself!",

Your feedback plays a vital role in shaping the final release.\nIf you haven’t joined an EAP before, check out this blog post to see how it works and what you can expect. These builds are free to use, and you can get the latest EAP build in several ways:\nDownload it from our website.\nUse the Toolbox App.\nInstall the snap package from the Snapcraft store if you’re using a compatible Linux distribution.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1\n                                                    \n\n\n\n\nRider 2025.3 EAP 1 release highlights\nThis first build brings a variety of updates for Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and more. Let’s take a closer look at the highlights of Rider 2025.3 EAP 1.\nUnity\nWe’ve added an IL Viewer for Unity projects (RIDER-86108). Previously, checking the IL code for Unity assemblies required manual steps and workarounds. Now Rider automatically finds the correct assemblies, so you can open the IL Viewer and inspect your Unity code right away.\nUnreal Engine\nRider now lets you customize which folders and files are included in the .uproject project model (RIDER-119424). This means that you can add extra projects, like a .csproj with your own file list, and Rider will load them automatically. This is especially useful if you work with additional scripting frameworks such as NoesisGUI.\nGodot\nWe’ve made several important updates to improve the Rider experience for Godot developers:\nGDExtension support: You can now work on GDExtensions in Rider using the new project template.\n\n\n\n\nTyped dictionaries support: No more parsing errors when working with typed dictionaries in GDScript in Rider.\n\n\n\n\nLeading whitespace style inspection: A new inspection detects inconsistent indentation (tabs vs. spaces) in GDScript files and provides a quick-fix to bring them in line with your configured code style.\n\n\n\n\nChickensoft GoDotTest support: You can now run and debug C# tests directly in Rider with the Chickensoft GoDotTest runner (RIDER-113850). \nAutomatic builds on focus change\nWe’ve introduced a new option that triggers a build whenever Rider loses focus (RIDER-127586). This makes working with Godot smoother, as it allows the Inspector to immediately reload and display updated exports without requiring manual builds. You can enable this option in Settings | Languages & Frameworks | Godot Engine.\n.slnx solution templates\nRider now lets you create .slnx solution files directly from its templates. Previously, the only way to create a .slnx solution file was to save a .sln file and rename it; that workaround is no longer needed.\nFor the complete list of updates in this build, head over to our issue tracker.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1 today and take the new features for a spin. Your feedback drives Rider forward, and we can’t wait to hear what you think.\nThank you for being part of our Early Access Program!\nDownload Rider 2025.3 EAP 1",

It also brings important improvements important improvements to ReSharper’s Out-of-Process (OOP) mode and several updates for ReSharper C++. Let’s take a closer look!\n\n\n\n\nFaster startup with Out-of-Process mode on .NET Core\nReSharper’s Out-of-Process mode now runs on .NET Core and starts up even faster, thanks to runtime performance gains. While stability and responsiveness remain the main goals of Out-of-Process mode, the faster startup is a nice bonus on top of these improvements. If you experience any issues with Out-of-Process mode, please let us know – drop a note in the comments or in our tracker.\nOut-of-Process mode enabled by default\nDuring this EAP cycle, ReSharper will run in Out-of-Process mode by default. Working out of process brings measurable performance improvements, but we want to hear your subjective experience. Is ReSharper faster or more responsive for you? Is it stable? \nPlease note:\nSome features are not yet available in Out-of-Process: .NET profilers (dotTrace, dotMemory), dotCover, Dynamic Program Analysis (DPA), and AI Assistant. Let us know which tools you rely on most so we can prioritize support. You can share your thoughts in this ticket.\nWhen running ReSharper in Out-of-Process mode, you may encounter exceptions. Most of them are diagnostic and not indicative of actual errors. Still, we’d appreciate you reporting them.\nIf you prefer, you can switch back to In-Process mode via ReSharper | Options | Environment | Products & Features by disabling the Run ReSharper in separate process option. Alternatively, start Visual Studio with the /ReSharper.InProcess flag to temporarily revert, and save this preference later in ReSharper’s Options.\nUpdates for C++ development\nReSharper C++ now supports several new C++26 features, including pack indexing, expansion statements, and structured bindings with packs (RSCPP-35817, RSCPP-36874, and RSCPP-36532).\n\n\n\n\nQuick Info in ReSharper C++ now shows class padding alongside size and alignment, helping you spot wasted memory at a glance (RSCPP-36866).\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve also added support for the GNU _Complex and _Imaginary keywords used in complex data types (RSCPP-15015).\n\n\n\n\nYou can now set the return value in the Extract Method refactoring to one of the local variables (RSCPP-23436).\nFor the full list of resolved issues and improvements, please refer to our issue tracker.\nTry it out and share your feedback\nThe latest EAP build is ready for you to explore. We encourage you to test the improvements and share your impressions. Your feedback directly shapes the future of ReSharper and .NET Tools, and we greatly appreciate your input.\nJoin the conversation in the comments or report issues via YouTrack. Stay tuned for more updates as the EAP cycle continues – there’s plenty more to come!\nDownload ReSharper 2025.3 EAP 1",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from the 2025.3 release, DataGrip and other JetBrains IDEs with database support will stop using the term query console. From now on, we’ll use query file – because consoles were essentially files all along, and it’s time the UI reflected that. We’ve made the workflow simpler, more discoverable, and more consistent.\nA bit of history 🏛️\nWhy did we have consoles in the first place? Here’s the short story.\nBack when JetBrains first added database functionality to IntelliJ IDEA, Java developers mostly worked with databases from the terminal. The quickest way to bring that workflow into the IDE was to give people a temporary area for writing SQL – and that temporary SQL file was called a console.\nFor many years, the IDE provided just one default console per project, and that seemed fine, but users asked for more. They wanted multiple consoles, the ability to pick the database or schema, and better control over context via the UI.\nProblems 😬\nConsoles were essentially script files, similar to what other database tools provide, but with a few quirks:\nNot part of the project. Consoles lived outside the project structure, even though users worked in a project in DataGrip.\nHard to find. They were stored in an obscure folder (next to scratch files), causing people to create consoles and then not know where to look for them. Because DataGrip autosaves these consoles, nothing was lost – but that made discovery more difficult. Users wouldn’t get a “save” prompt, so they’d create consoles and later be surprised they couldn’t find them or change their context without extra steps.\nDifficult context switching. You couldn’t change the dialect, data source, or schema for a console file via the UI. If you wanted it to behave like a local file, you had to manually save or transfer it.\nConfusing name. The term query console didn’t communicate what the feature actually was, and we kept getting feedback that newcomers didn’t understand it.\nIn short, consoles were useful in spirit but awkward in practice. Something had to change.\nThe change 🧚🏻‍♀️\nWe agonized, deliberated, and then did the obvious: merged consoles and files.\nPractically, query editing is now file-based, so query scripts are visible in your project, easy to locate, and flexible to manage.\nHow it works now:\nTo write a query to the database, create a query file from the context menu of the data source or any of its objects, like you did before with query consoles. This new file will be named Query_[$DATA_SOURCE$].sql.  The name pattern can be customized in Settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, query files are saved in the queries folder, which is located in the project folder. The project folder (and the queries folder) is visible in the Files tool window. You can change the storage path in Settings, and any custom folder you select will also appear in the Files tool window.\n\n\n\n\nFiles with an attached database context now show a data-source-like icon instead of the generic database icon used before. This should make query files easier to spot. We’d especially love to hear your feedback about this visual update.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll prior console limitations are gone! You can now re-attach query files, change their dialect and data source, and treat them like ordinary project files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jump to Query Console button on the database explorer toolbar has been renamed to Jump to Query File and given a new icon. It now lists all query files associated with the current data source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you upgrade DataGrip, a migration dialog will help you transfer all of your consoles to files and guide you through the new workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe old Database Consoles folder under the Scratches and Consoles will remain for one more release cycle, after which we’ll remove it completely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ ❓\nWill my existing consoles be lost? \n\nNo. We’re carefully converting them to *.sql files and keeping them in the old location, but only for one release cycle.\nCan I keep the old behavior?\n\nTechnically, you can, but only for one more release cycle and only for old projects. You will keep seeing a migration dialog after each IDE restart, however. For new projects, only the new logic will work.\nWhat happens to the consoles of global data sources?\nIn the migration dialog, you will be able to define a separate folder for migrating consoles of such data sources. This folder will be saved in the settings and will serve as the default location for query files created for global data sources. To access these files from the IDE, you will need to attach the folder to each specific project.\nWill the same thing happen in other JetBrains IDEs?\n\nYes, but for now it’s only released in DataGrip EAP. The only difference is that in other JetBrains IDEs with database functionality, query files are migrated by default to a folder inside the .idea subfolder within the project. This folder is usually listed in .gitignore.\nWhat’s next ⏭️\nLater in this 2025.3 release cycle, we’ll add a Query Files node to the database explorer. Clicking it will show all files associated with the current data source, further improving discoverability.\nWe’re rolling out this change in the first EAP build to gather feedback from our community. Please try it out and tell us what’s missing.\n\n\n\n\nLet us know what you think in any of these ways:\nComment in the corresponding YouTrack ticket\nComplete the feedback form: https://www.jetbrains.com/feedback/datagrip/\nEmail us at datagrip@jetbrains.com\nTag @DataGrip on X or follow https://x.com/datagrip\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback!\nThe DataGrip team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We hear you. And you’re right – the new quotas are a reduction from what you experienced. When we launched, we had little usage data for agentic experiences and no top‑up feature existed, so we set quotas much higher than the real cost of AI usage (tokens from providers) as a temporary measure. That felt great, but it loses money at scale and puts the product at risk. We set expectations incorrectly. That’s on us.\nCheck more details about the new quotas in the original blog post.\nYour Most Frequent Questions\n“It’s not transparency; it’s paying more for less.”\nFirst, cost. There’s no scam here. We’re aligning usage to real, public provider prices per token. Whether you run through us or directly with providers, it will be similar. Discounts vary, and yes, some companies still burn VC money to attract users (also that’s changing). We’re a real business; we can’t play that game. This is the real price of AI. Our job now is to make sure the value you get from our product far exceeds what you spend.\nSecond, transparency. We’ll roll out UX updates with statistics in a few weeks, and more usage details and controls after that. Being transparent about a bad situation is better than having unclear or uncontrolled terms. Our previous quotas were a temporary measure, and so they were not transparent. With the new approach, the rules of the game are clear. This is a sustainable foundation that will help us look further into the future and design new products and services around it. \n\n\n\n\n“I can’t estimate how many credits I need for specific tasks.”\nAI usage isn’t a flat fee because it depends on the type of model you use and the amount of text (tokens) flowing in and out. That means the same question can cost differently depending on how it’s phrased, how much context is added, or how long the conversation goes. In agentic workflows, where the AI may iterate and correct itself, usage can naturally be higher.\nThat said, you don’t have to fly blind. We aim to give you the tools to get the best grasp on AI usage and make sure you stay in control:\nClear pricing per credit: We align with public provider costs, so you always know the unit price.\nTransparent usage stats: We’re rolling out UX updates that let you see exactly where credits go. It will roll out in waves, with the first wave in the next few weeks.\nBest-practice guides: We will share ways to phrase prompts and structure workflows so you get quality results faster (and spend less).\nSafeguards: Subscription quotas and alerts help prevent unexpected overuse, and you can always top up to continue your work.\nThink of credits like fuel for your AI workflows: you may not know the exact mileage before the trip, but you’ll always see your fuel gauge and can plan accordingly.\n“My quota runs out in half a day. Is it a bug?”\nNo – the quota got smaller for both AI Pro and AI Ultimate. In our data, about 80% of users (plan and usage dependent) won’t hit the new limits. The downside is that the most active AI users are the most affected.\nAgain, we’re not targeting you and we’re not slicing by some percentile; we’re aligning with costs so we don’t burn money indefinitely, while still giving away more (e.g. AI Ultimate includes roughly 15% more value than you pay each month, and annual plans can go up to about 40% more than your pay). \nThere’s another reason quotas can vanish fast: agentic workflows. Agents collect context and iterate through a plan; that means multiple, long requests that eat tokens. Junie, our coding agent, is built for quality on real‑world dev tasks. Speed and cost are part of the product. Early on, we took this risk on us. That was fine for kick‑off – but it’s not how this works long‑term.\nJunie is designed for complex tasks and provides high quality output. Code generation, verification and tests together take more AI credits – but it also helps Junie achieve the better result for your job. We don’t want to sacrifice quality over speed: we benchmark the models and choose the best for your tasks, we always prioritize Junie’s ability to compare the solutions and offer you the most suitable one. We train Junie to verify the steps it is taking – not just to generate code faster, but to create solutions that you can use and maintain. All this helps Junie perform like agents in more expensive plans (up to $200/month), but we aim to keep the cost of usage reasonable and constantly work on optimization.\nSmart ways to think about your AI quota\nTrack your usage (detailed stats are coming soon; for now, watch your in‑app meter).\nConsider the best tool for the task – whether it’s an AI agent (complex workflows, iterations, validation, etc.) or an AI assistant (more straightforward Q&A and one-step solutions). \nBe intentional with the way you prompt and the model choice (e.g., GPT‑5 is often cheaper than Claude 4 with comparable results – try switching if it works for you).\nStart over instead of a follow-up if you feel that the agent is lost. Based on the way LLMs work, multiple follow-ups (e.g., more than seven) usually drift away and take more credits (the longer the chat, the more context is passed with every request) but may not get you closer to the result you have in mind.\nFavor smaller/cheaper models for drafts (check the hints in AI Chat), then upgrade for final runs.\n“I just paid for an annual AI subscription based on the old patterns. Why no refund?”\nWe do have a refund policy, and some of you have already received refunds that extended your non‑AI subscriptions. Given this, we understand the frustration. Even if the refund window has passed, we’ve prepared a set of special alternatives for annual AI Pro and AI Ultimate users; you can select the one that works best for you. Keep in mind that we can’t grant refunds for All Products Pack and dotUltimate beyond regular policies, because AI Pro was included there at no extra charge.\nThat said, we still think annual subscriptions are a good deal. Example: AI Ultimate (annual) gives you 420 AI Credits for $300 — roughly 40% more credits than your payment at public rates.\n***\nAI is a great tool, and it’s changing how we build software. But it’s not magic — especially not free, unlimited magic. As professionals, we should understand how it works, how much it costs, and how to use it better. In the real world, speed and cost matter as much as quality. We believe that’s where the industry is heading. So let’s face it and start mastering these together.\nThank you to everyone who’s supported us – and for all the honest feedback. We’re building a sustainable business. Our future is tied to the value we create for you, so we’ll keep delivering exactly that step by step.",

Please keep this in mind when using them.\nIn this post, we’d like to share a glimpse of what’s in our planning dashboards for the upcoming release. The list below is neither final nor exhaustive, but it’s meant to show the direction we’re heading.\nSingle distribution \nIn 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA will move to unified distribution, and several important changes related will appear during the EAP cycle. These include more features becoming available without subscription, such as wizards, basic highlighting for JavaScript, SQL, JPQL, template engines markup, and support database schema exploration. A detailed list of features going free will be published closer to the release.\nAlso there will be no IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition EAP builds available in the Toolbox App or from the IntelliJ Platform Gradle plugin. Please use the EAP builds of IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate instead. More information about Gradle builds will be published later on platform.jetbrains.com.\nTechnology updates \nWe’re continuing our effort to support the latest technologies you may use in your projects. This release brings full support for Java 25, Spring Boot 4, JUnit 6, all expected to be released within the next few months.\nSpring \nIn addition to supporting new features introduced for Spring 7, we’re working on significantly improving Spring Data JDBC support and extending the capabilities of the Spring Debugger introduced in v2025.2.\nKotlin\nKotlin support in the IDE continues to improve, with enhancements to code completion and overall quality in K2 mode. In addition to support for Spring 7, the Kotlin Routing DSL is getting better IDE assistance, along with various quality-of-life improvements for Spring development.\nFor Kotlin Notebook, we’re also improving stability and adding more improvements, like support for database integration – one of the most common scenarios in server-side development.\nKubernetes support\nStarting with 2025.3, we’re improving the experience of working with Kubernetes YAML files. We’re aiming to enable inlay quick actions in the editor for faster port forwarding, resource status updates, current context selection, and easier access to secrets.\nUser experience\nIn v2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA is getting a visual upgrade – the new Islands theme. Based on the feedback we’ve collected and our experiments in the previous release cycle, we’re now looking into making it the new default. We are going to share more details about the new theme soon.\nMeanwhile, you can try the Islands theme in this EAP build by enabling it in Settings | Appearance & Behavior | Appearance | Theme.\nAnother notable change we’re working on is the new Welcome screen that takes you straight into the IDE, with no extra dialog windows or additional clicks.\nWe’re also working on improving how the IDE communicates with you while project indexes are still being built. This includes a clearer overview of background tasks and more transparent, predictable progress indicators so you can stay focused on your code with fewer distractions.\nRemote development\nFollowing the improvements introduced in the previous release to refine the remote development experience, we’re continuing in the same direction. In v2025.3, we plan to enable smoother typing for more languages including CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and shell scripts. Additionally, the launch experience is being revamped to accelerate startup and make it more seamless.\nTerminal\nIn v2025.3, we’re bringing AI support to the terminal, starting with inline completion as the first step.\nStability\nA large portion of our team’s workload is dedicated to maintaining the quality and stability of the IDE. We’ll communicate those improvements in a dedicated What’s Fixed post, like we did for the previous release.\nFor the full list of fixes and improvements already included in the first 2025.3 EAP build, please refer to the release notes.\nShare your feedback\nTake part in the Early Access Program by trying out the EAP builds and sharing your feedback with us. You can get in touch with us on X, BlueSky or LinkedIn, or leave a comment below. If you come across a bug or something that doesn’t work as expected, please report it via our issue tracker.\nHappy developing!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Java release cadence means we get a new Java version every six months. Java 25 was released on September 16, 2025. At JetBrains, we are committed to supporting new technologies in IntelliJ IDEA and adding useful enhancements for both stable and preview features. In this blog post, we will give you an overview of some changes to the Java language and how they are supported in IntelliJ IDEA. This post is limited to stable features only. Preview features will be covered separately in dedicated blog posts on relevant topics.\nJava 25 includes several changes to the language that make Java easier to use. Features like compact source files and instance main methods, as well as module import declarations, make it easier to get started with Java, both for students and when creating small projects like prototypes or hobby projects. Flexible constructor bodies allow more flexibility in constructors, giving you the option to calculate or validate data before calling the constructor of the super class. Scoped values are a new model for thread-local variables, adapted to virtual threads. They will be more useful with structured concurrency, which is currently still in preview.\nApart from changes to the language itself, there are improvements to both performance and performance insights. Compact object headers reduce memory footprint and improve cache efficiency. Ahead-of-time method profiling lets the JVM warm up more quickly by using execution data from prior runs, improving startup performance. Improvements to garbage collection (GC) like generational Shenandoah, plus better class-loading and linking optimizations, contribute to noticeably smoother server-style workloads.\nAs Java 25 is an LTS (long-term support) release, many people will be migrating to this version from Java 21, 17, 11, or even earlier. If you are coming to Java 25 from Java 21, have a look at the section describing the most relevant changes since Java 21.\nBefore diving into the new features, let’s set up IntelliJ IDEA to use Java 25.\nUsing Java 25 in IntelliJ IDEA (setup)\nTo use Java 25, you will need to download the JDK. You can do so from inside IntelliJ IDEA or by using tools like SDKMAN! To download a JDK from IntelliJ IDEA, open the Project Structure, go to the tab Project Settings | Project, open the drop-down menu in the SDK field, and select Download JDK. \nDownloading JDK from inside IntelliJ IDEA\n\n\n\nIn the Download JDK popup that opens, set Version to 25, and in the Vendor field, select the vendor you want to use. \nYou can also download Early Access (EA) versions of the JDK from inside IntelliJ IDEA, for example, when the next release becomes available or if you’d like to try Valhalla (which is based on Java 23). IntelliJ IDEA will warn you that these are not intended for production use. \nDownloading an Early Access version\n\n\n\nNext, you need to configure IntelliJ IDEA to use the right language level. To use Java 25 stable features, which is recommended for production code, set Language level to 25 – Compact source files, module imports.\nSetting Language level to 25\n\n\n\nIf you want to try out preview features, set Language level to 25 (Preview) – Primitive Types in Patterns, etc.\nSetting Language level to 25 (Preview)\n\n\n\nNew stable features in Java 25\nLet’s take a look at some of the features Java 25 introduces and how IntelliJ IDEA can help you use them.\nCompact Source Files and Instance Main Methods (JEP 512)\nJava has been working on the so-called “on-ramp”, making the language easier to use. Compact source files and instance main methods are part of that effort. It is now possible for beginners to start writing code without needing to learn about language concepts that they won’t need until they start writing larger programs. For experienced programmers, this feature can help them quickly prototype ideas without needing a lot of boilerplate code. Code can be evolved and expanded as skills and applications grow. \nTo quickly see the difference, let’s look at a classic example: HelloWorld. We have probably all written a HelloWorld example when we first started, possibly in a language other than Java or English. The classic HelloWorld.java looks like this:\npublic class HelloWorld {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n       System.out.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n   }\n}\nTo write this code, you had to declare a class and a lengthy main method, including concepts like public and static that are not relevant to beginners. Let’s compare this to the HelloWorld example using new features from compact source files and instance main methods. \nWhen creating a new Java class via New | Java Class, in the New Java Class popup, select the Compact source file option. Note that this compact source file is created in the root directory of your project, even if you create it from another package. IntelliJ IDEA automatically adds an instance main method – void main() – to the file. Next, you can add a method to print “Hello, World!”. You can now use IO.println() as a convenience method without needing to understand what System.out means and without even needing to add a static import. If you do want to add a static import for java.lang.IO, IntelliJ IDEA offers a quick-fix to do so.\nCreating `HelloWorld.java`\n\n\n\nNote that different variations of the main method are now possible, as described here.\nIntelliJ IDEA has some new live templates to add a main method to an implicit class, either with or without arguments: main, maina, psvm, and psvma. Using the psvm or main live templates inside a compact source file will add the new main method, while they will continue to add the classic main method inside a class, as you can see in the preview.\nLive templates for the main method in a compact source file\n\n\n\nLive templates for the main method in a compact source file\n\n\n\nOur new version of HelloWorld now looks like this:\nvoid main() {\n   IO.println(\"Hello, World!\");\n}\nCompare this code to the original example. It is much shorter, contains less boilerplate, and is limited to only the things we need: a main method and a call to print a line with the provided “Hello, World!” String.\nAs beginners often need to interact with the console, a convenient readln() method was also added. This is an overloaded method which can take a String argument that is printed to the console before reading the input. Let’s expand our previous example to read a name from the console. To help you use these new convenience methods, IntelliJ IDEA introduces two new live templates: iop for println() and ior for readln().\nExpanding the example to use the convenience method readln()\n\n\n\nNote that these changes to the language are also taken into account when creating new projects. When you create a new Java project, set Build system to IntelliJ, and select Add sample code, a compact source file with a void main() method will be added. \nCreating a new project with the IntelliJ build system\n\n\n\nPrototyping and teaching\nWhile extremely useful for students and teachers, this feature does not just benefit beginners. It also allows experienced developers to quickly try out ideas or create a prototype. \nWhen you create a new Java project with Maven or Gradle as the selected build system, the generated source code will include a regular class, but with IO.println() instead of System.out.println(). If you are using Maven or Gradle, you’re likely working on something bigger, with actual classes instead of compact source files. Another reason to use classes is that a compact source file needs to be in the default package, and frameworks generally don’t support this. \nCreating a new project with Maven\n\n\n\nTo quickly create a prototype, you can create a Java compact file from the src/main/java directory in the Project tool window. IntelliJ IDEA will provide a default name for the file, so your thought process is not disrupted when you want to quickly try something out.\nCreating a Java compact file\n\n\n\nWhen prototyping, learning, or teaching, you can gradually expand your code to include features you might need when writing code that is part of a larger project, or when introducing new concepts to your students. You can convert an implicit class to a regular class using the Convert an implicitly declared class of a compact source file into a regular class quick-fix.\nConverting an implicitly declared class of a compact source file into a regular class\n\n\n\nShould you prefer to use an implicit class at any point, the reverse is also possible. Similarly, there are quick-fixes to convert IO.println() to System.out.println(), and vice versa. These are probably not things you would do as part of your daily work. But you might use features like this for coding challenges, like Advent of Code, or other fun side projects.\nThe new void main() method does not need String[] args. However, should you decide to use the args in your code, IntelliJ IDEA will help you by adding them to the method, as you can see below. If you like this kind of completion, please let us know in the comments what you are currently missing. \nCompletion to add `args` to the main method\n\n\n\nWith this feature, we finally have a separation in Java between prototypes and other small projects, and enterprise applications. IntelliJ IDEA supports both small and large applications. \nWe have already covered this feature in a previous Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA post, when it was still in preview. Please have a look at that post to learn about additional support for this feature in IntelliJ IDEA. For a more in-depth explanation of this specific feature, see Mala Gupta’s previous post Java 24: ‘HelloWorld’ and ‘main()’ meet minimalistic. There are examples of practical use cases on when and how to use it to create small programs and prototypes in Java 24: Build Games, Prototypes, Utilities, and More – With Less Boilerplate. Note that (among other things) the following was changed in Java 25: Compact source files were previously called simple source files, and you now need to use the qualified name IO.println() or use an import statement.\nModule Import Declarations (JEP 511)\nModule import declarations simplify the importing of frequently used classes (java.base) or modular libraries, without having to keep adding individual import statements to keep the compiler happy (even though IntelliJ IDEA can do this for you 😉). This feature makes things easier. You can write code without needing to worry about imports, which is useful when learning or prototyping.\nAlternatively, if you have a class that imports multiple classes from a module, you can replace them with a module import statement. When you perform the Optimize imports action, the individual imports for classes imported by the module will be removed.\nAs your codebase grows, you might prefer to add import statements with specific imports, which you can do using the Replace with single class imports quick-fix.\nOptimizing imports\n\n\n\nIf you would like to remove unused module imports when performing Optimize imports, you can configure this in the settings. Open Settings | Editor | Code Style | Java and go to the Imports tab. Then, select the Delete unused module imports option.\nConfiguring the IDE to delete unused module imports\n\n\n\nTo see which packages are exported by a module, click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut for Go to Declaration or Usages, as shown here. \nYou might wonder what the difference is between module imports and wildcard imports. Wildcard imports in Java allow you to replace the import for multiple classes from the same package with one line, containing an *. Module imports allow you to import classes from different packages. One downside of this is the risk of potential namespace clashes. But don’t worry, IntelliJ IDEA can help you identify and fix these, as described here. \nShould you replace your current import statements with module imports? Probably not. In enterprise code, most developers prefer to have single imports. Note that IntelliJ IDEA allows you to configure the number of imports to add before replacing them with a wildcard. By default, this number is set to five. To change it, open Settings, go to Editor | Code Style | Java, and open the Imports tab. Then, set Class count to use import with ‘*’ to the desired number. Since most coding standards prefer single imports over wildcard imports, we assume the same will be true for module imports. For this reason, we are not planning to have an inspection to automatically replace existing imports with import module java.base;. \nHowever, even if you’re not using this feature explicitly, you will use it implicitly when using compact source files (described above). This feature was previously described in Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA. For more background information, see Module Import Declarations: No More Import Hell by Mala Gupta.\nFlexible Constructor Bodies (JEP 513)\nWith flexible constructor bodies, previously known as “statements before super()”, you are now allowed to write statements in the constructor of a derived class before calling the constructor of the super class. This is useful if you want to validate or compute data in your constructor before passing it to super(), or when a superclass calls a method from its constructor that you want to override in the subclass and access a field from the subclass inside this method. \nPreviously, the call to super() had to be the first call in the constructor. IntelliJ IDEA would give you a warning if you tried to add statements before super().\nWarning about a statement before `super()`\n\n\n\nA workaround for this restriction is to call static methods inline, as arguments passed to super(). While this is still possible, you now have the flexibility to call these methods before calling super() with the results.\nThere are some limitations on which types of statements you can execute before the call to super(). The statements cannot access the object under construction, which means you cannot access instance members of a class before the execution of super() completes or call methods of the derived class.\nThis new functionality should be used responsibly. Just because you can put arbitrary code before super() doesn’t mean you should move every possible validation or I/O operation into constructors. Constructors are best kept lightweight, deterministic, and free of heavy side effects. Expensive operations, retries, or external resource access are better handled in factories, builders, or initialization methods.\nIn short, this feature lets you model object invariants more naturally through inheritance, but it doesn’t change the golden rule – constructors should remain focused and predictable.\nWhile this feature might not be that exciting by itself, it is a necessary step to make value classes and objects (currently in preview), as well as upcoming null-restricted value class types (currently in draft), possible. Both of these features are part of Project Valhalla. We will discuss this topic later in a separate blog post.\nFor a more detailed explanation of this feature and examples of how to use it, have a look at the following video featuring Dr. Venkat Subramaniam:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis feature was previously described in Java 24 and IntelliJ IDEA. For additional details and examples, see Mala Gupta’s previous blog post Constructor Makeover in Java 22. Note that this post was written when this feature was still in preview. The only significant change since then is that a constructor body is now allowed to initialize fields in the same class before invoking a constructor. \nScoped Values (JEP 506)\nScoped values are a new model for thread-local variables adapted to virtual threads. They make it possible to share immutable data within a thread and with child threads in a convenient, safe, and scalable way.\nIn some cases, you want to share data between components of your application or between your application and a framework, such as information about a logged-in user and their permissions. While it is possible to use thread-local variables (variables of type ThreadLocal), there are several downsides to doing so, which might cause potential issues.\nThreadLocal variables are mutable, which makes it hard to keep track of their current value and to reason about the code. The value of a ThreadLocal variable is retained for the lifetime of a thread, unless explicitly removed by calling the remove() method. Developers may forget to do so, which means data might be stored in memory longer than needed, leading to potential performance problems, as well as security issues because data might be visible to unrelated code running on the same thread. ThreadLocal variables can be inherited by a child thread, but each child thread will need to create a copy of the variable, which can add to the memory footprint.\nVirtual threads, added in Java 21, allow us to create many more threads than platform threads. If they each retain a copy of a thread-local variable, this will impact the memory usage. On the other hand, virtual threads may not live as long as platform threads, which minimizes the potential for memory leaks. \nTo use a ScopedValue, you need to first declare it. It makes sense to declare it as final. Next, you need to bind the ScopedValue to some data and pass a Runnable or ScopedValue.CallableOp, which may be realized as a lambda. This is done in the ScopedValue.where() method. The operation – and any code called from it – will be able to get the ScopedValue, but once it is done running, this data will be cleaned up. Scoped values have a clearly defined scope, which makes the code easier to reason about. If you try to use a ScopedValue that is not bound, a NoSuchElementException is thrown, as you can see in the following example.\nUsing `ScopedValue`\n\n\n\nWhile you cannot set a ScopedValue, you can rebind it. In the example below, the variable is bound to the value “24” inside the main method. The update() method is called from here, where the value is bound to “25” (24 + 1). When printed, it will print the current value, “25”.\npublic class RebindExample {\n   ScopedValue<Integer> JAVA_VERSION = ScopedValue.newInstance();\n   void main() {\n       ScopedValue.where(JAVA_VERSION, 24).run(this::update);\n   }\n\n   private void update() {\n       ScopedValue.where(JAVA_VERSION, JAVA_VERSION.get() + 1).run(() -> {\n           IO.println(\"Hello, Java \" + JAVA_VERSION.get()); // prints 25\n       });\n   }\n}\nScoped values are even more useful with structured concurrency, currently in its fifth preview.\nStructured concurrency will make it possible for data to be automatically inherited by any threads that a thread forks. The child threads’ scope will be contained in the parent thread’s scope. With scoped values, it is no longer necessary to make copies of the data, meaning they scale very well with many (virtual) threads. This topic deserves its own blog post, where we can dive deeper into new use cases, migration paths, and performance comparisons between different approaches. \nAs we have seen, scoped values solve several problems associated with ThreadLocal.They reduce memory overhead, improve predictability, and make reasoning about concurrent code much easier. Does this mean you should immediately rewrite all your code to use ScopedValue? Not necessarily. Frameworks like Spring and others still rely heavily on ThreadLocal, and migrating all existing components to Java 25 isn’t something that will happen overnight. Also, the intention behind scoped values was never to deprecate or replace ThreadLocal outright, but to offer a cleaner, safer alternative. However, you might consider using scoped values for new code or modules, especially where you are already facing typical ThreadLocal issues: leaks, context propagation, and cleanup.\nPerformance and profiler improvements\nLanguage features are just half of the story. Java 25 also brings significant runtime improvements. Let’s take a brief look at the changes:\nAhead-of-Time Method Profiling (JEP 515) speeds up warm-up by using method execution profile data from a prior run. The JVM can use that data immediately at startup so that hot methods are already known, reducing the delay before reaching peak performance. \nJFR Cooperative Sampling (JEP 518) and JFR Method Timing & Tracing (JEP 520) improve observability: Cooperative sampling lets threads report profiling data at safe points to reduce overhead and increase accuracy, and method timing and tracing give more precise, detailed call durations and call stack information. \nCompact Object Headers (JEP 519) shrink the object header on 64-bit JVMs from its larger experimental form to a compact 64-bit layout. This reduces memory overhead (especially with many small objects) and improves garbage collection (GC) and cache behavior. \nGenerational Shenandoah (JEP 521) adds generational GC support to the Shenandoah garbage collector so that young-generation objects can be collected more efficiently, reducing pause times and improving throughput for workloads with many short-lived objects.\nMoving from Java 21 to Java 25\nIf you are upgrading to Java 25 from Java 21, here is an overview of some of the stable features you might not be familiar with yet.\nStream Gatherers (JEP 485)\nStream Gatherers were added in Java 24. They improve the Stream API, added in Java 8. Stream gatherers allow you to add your own custom intermediate operations to a stream.\nFor an explanation of this feature and how you can use it, watch the following livestream with José Paumard:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’d like more background information on this feature, you might be interested in the following video we created when this feature was still in preview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we highly recommend this video from JavaOne by Viktor Klang, the creator of the feature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Documentation Comments (JEP 467)\nMarkdown documentation comments were added in Java 23. As the name suggests, it is now possible to use Markdown in your JavaDoc. Back when Java was first created, HTML seemed like a logical choice for JavaDoc, but these days you might prefer Markdown. \nIntelliJ IDEA supports the adoption of this feature by offering a quick-fix to convert JavaDoc to Markdown. If you have JavaDoc that you would like to convert, press Alt+Enter when the cursor is on your JavaDoc and select the Convert to Markdown documentation comment option.\nConverting a documentation comment to Markdown\n\n\n\nDoes this mean you should convert your existing JavaDoc to Markdown? Not necessarily. You might just consider writing your documentation in Markdown from now on. However, should you want to convert it, IntelliJ IDEA can help you.\nFor more information on this feature, have a look at Markdown in Java Docs? Shut Up and Take My Comments! by Mala Gupta.\nIf you’re interested in more background on this feature, check out the video that was created when it was still in preview:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnnamed Variables & Patterns (JEP 456)\nUnnamed variables and patterns make it possible to use unnamed variables and unnamed patterns when variable declarations or nested patterns are required but the actual variables or patterns are not used. Denoting unnamed variables and patterns with an _ clearly conveys that they are not used elsewhere in the code. IntelliJ IDEA will detect when an unused local variable could be replaced with an underscore _ and offer a quick-fix to do so. \nRenaming a variable to ‘_’\n\n\n\nFor more details on this feature, see Drop the Baggage: Use ‘_’ for Unnamed Local Variables and Patterns in Java 22 by Mala Gupta.\nVirtual Threads (JEP 444) and Synchronize Virtual Threads without Pinning (JEP 491)\nAdded in Java 21, virtual threads are lightweight threads. Unlike platform threads, which are limited by the number of cores in your machine, you can create a potentially unlimited number of virtual threads. Virtual threads improve the scalability of your applications. They do need platform threads to perform their work, but can release them when they are waiting for blocking code. Tooling like jcmd and IntelliJ IDEA can collect thread dumps with virtual threads included.\nSynchronizing virtual threads without pinning (added in Java 24) improves the scalability of Java code that uses synchronized code. Virtual threads that block in synchronized blocks now release their underlying platform threads so they can be used by other virtual threads. This last improvement comes for free when you upgrade from Java 21 to Java 24 or higher. To see this in action, watch the demo we did in the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRuntime and security improvements\nJava 24 introduced some changes related to post-quantum cryptography readiness. The Java platform is preparing for the future of secure computing: \nQuantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism (JEP 496) and Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (JEP 497), introduced in Java 24, are NIST-standardized post-quantum algorithms (lattice-based) aimed at replacing or augmenting classic public-key operations like RSA and ECDSA. Java also receives a performance boost. Garbage collection, memory footprint, and startup times all see measurable improvements:\nRegion Pinning for G1 (JEP 423) allows the G1 garbage collector to continue collecting parts of the heap even when some regions are in JNI critical sections. Instead of stalling GC during such critical regions, only “pinned” regions are excluded, reducing latency in mixed JNI/native workloads. \nThe Foreign Function & Memory API (JEP 454), added in Java 22, offers better performance and safety over the old JNI for foreign memory and calling native code. Bulk operations are more efficient, with less overhead in cross-boundary calls. \nZGC: Generational Mode by Default (JEP 474). The Z Garbage Collector, which is typically low-pause, uses generational mode by default starting with Java 23. Separation between young and old objects improves GC efficiency for applications that create many short-lived objects.\nAdditionally, there are further enhancements to core libraries, previews, and performance ergonomics – for example, improvements to default GC settings, memory management, etc. \nUpgrading from Java 21 to 25\nYou can find a video series that covers the Road to Java 25 on the official Java YouTube channel. We recommend watching How to Upgrade to Java 25 by Nikolai Parlog. The Oracle DevRel team also has a Java 25 livestream on September 16, 2025.\nConclusion\nAs you have seen, several additions to the language make Java easier to use, both for students and teachers, as well as experienced programmers. In fact, these features completely change the experience of using Java, by no longer requiring boilerplate code like the public static void main(String[] args) method, allowing statements before super(), offering the possibility to add custom intermediary operations in streams using gatherers, allowing underscores as variable names for unused variables, and and providing scoped values as a convenient, safe, and scalable alternative to ThreadLocal. With all of these changes, Java is moving forward fast. IntelliJ IDEA aims to move just as quickly by supporting these new features with relevant inspections and quick-fixes, as well as new live templates, and integrating them into existing features like the debugger. Other than improvements in the language, there are also runtime improvements that you get for free when upgrading your JDK.\nWe think Java 25 is the best Java release (so far!) and we recommend you switch to it as soon as you can. Even if you’re not using the Java language features, you will still benefit from using the new JDK. Java 25 offers a new baseline for the language, and the runtime is the fastest it has ever been.\nIf you are on Java 21, we have provided an overview of what you might have missed in terms of language features. And if you’re on an even older version of Java, now would be the time to start the process to upgrade, not just because of the benefits to you but also because the ecosystem is moving forward. Java 17 is the current baseline for Spring and Spring Boot as of Spring 6 or Spring Boot 3. The upcoming Maven 4 will require JDK 17 to run. But don’t worry, you can still compile projects with older Java versions! The upcoming JUnit 6 is also targeting JDK 17. If you are still on Java 8 (or older), now is the time to start upgrading!\nIntelliJ IDEA will continue to support the latest Java features with Java 26.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "“Not a constant expression.” You’ve seen the diagnostics and the note trail, but never the actual state. Until now.\nModern C++ pushes more logic into constexpr/consteval: parsers, tables, DSLs, hashing – real code with real branches. When code fails at compile time, you can either try to guess the reason from the compiler’s notes or de‑constexpr it and hope the runtime reproduction matches what the compiler actually did.\nThe new Constexpr Debugger available in the first CLion 2025.3 EAP build allows you to stay in the compiler’s world and see what really happens – by stepping through evaluation, inspecting values, and confirming which if constexpr branch fired. Using it helps you understand exactly what the compiler is doing and fix issues faster.\n\n\n\n\nWith reflection coming in C++26 (P2996R13), compile‑time code will increase even more. Although none of the compilers support reflection yet, the Constexpr Debugger in CLion provides a foundation that will allow for debugging this metacode in the future.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.3 EAP\nFeatures\nHere is what you currently can do with the Constexpr Debugger:\nStart step-by-step debugging from the gutter by clicking the Debug button next to static_assert(...) or a constexpr declarator to check how it was evaluated or why it failed.\nUse the same actions as in the regular debugger: Step Into, Step Over, Step Out, and Restart. Additionally, you can use Step Backward, the compile-time reverse stepping feature.\nSee what the compiler sees: the call stack, locals, last returns, and template arguments of the current instantiation. \nHover over a variable to see its values, use Evaluate Expression, or navigate to the source code from the call stack.\nInspect the entire context when constant evaluation fails to determine when and why it occurred.\nHow to use the Constexpr Debugger\nBasic case\nTo provide you with an overview of the basic actions that you can perform when debugging constexpr, we’ll use this compile-time Fibonacci cache implementation:\n#include <array>\n\ntemplate<std::size_t N>\nstruct FibCache {\n    std::array<int, N + 1> memo{};\n\n    constexpr FibCache() {\n        memo[0] = 0; memo[1] = 1;\n        for (std::size_t i = 2; i <= N; ++i)\n            memo[i] = memo[i - 1] + memo[i - 2];\n    }\n\n    constexpr int operator()(int n) const { return memo[n]; }\n};\n\nconstexpr int get_fibonacci(int n) {\n    FibCache<8> cache;\n    auto result = cache(n);\n    return result;\n}\n\nconstexpr int k = get_fibonacci(6);          // gutter: step through operator()\nstatic_assert(get_fibonacci(6) == 8, \"ok\");  // gutter available here too\nThe following are some basic operations you can perform when debugging:\nFind the green Debug icon next to the constexpr declarator or static_assert (either will do) and click it to run a Constexpr Debugger session.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the regular debugger actions, or try Step Backward to time‑travel one step back in your compile‑time evaluation.\n\n\n\n                                                \n                        \n\n\n\nInspect the state:\n\nWatch how the this->memo array fills during construction by hovering over it in the editor (see the screenshot below).\nNavigate to the Variables pane to see this, locals (like i), and recent returns.\nHover over any variable to see its value.\nNavigate to the Call Stack to see frames mapped to source.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the result in the Variables pane after the constructor has precomputed all the Fibonacci numbers:\n\n\n\n\nEdge case: non-constexpr call prevents evaluation\nConsider the case when we have a function (fail) that is not constexpr – it’s deliberately called to indicate invalid input. This means that the original expression (parse_int(“hello”)) cannot be evaluated at compile time.\n#include <string_view>\n\nvoid fail(); // note: non-constexpr\n\nconsteval int parse_digit(char c) {\n    if (c < '0' || c > '9') {\n        fail();\n    }\n\n    return c - '0';\n}\n\nconsteval int parse_int(std::string_view s) {\n    int result = 0;\n    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {\n        result = result * 10 + parse_digit(s[i]);\n    }\n\n    return result;\n}\n\nconstexpr auto digit = parse_int(\"12345\");\nconstexpr auto bad_digit = parse_int(\"hello\"); // start from the gutter\nStepping here lets you see c == 'x', the taken branch, the value of argument c, and the exact point at which the evaluation fails:\n\n                        \n\n\nCurrent limitations\nBreakpoints and Run to Cursor / Force Run to Cursor are not supported in constexpr evaluation.\nC++20 modules aren’t yet supported: constexpr debugging does not navigate to entities located in imported modules.\nStepping may not work properly with some language constructs or compound statements.\nSome constructs aren’t yet supported by our constexpr evaluator. We track these unsupported cases in YouTrack.\nWe don’t have a definite timeline for when these missing bits of support might be added, but we’re working on them, so stay tuned!\nShare your feedback\nYour feedback is essential for improving this feature and making it more robust. We encourage you to try the Constexpr Debugger and share your thoughts and suggestions by submitting a ticket to our issue tracker or commenting below.\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2025.3 EAP",

        "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/mcp-prompts-resources-sampling/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 17 Sep 2025 17:30:37 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to announce that Visual Studio now supports MCP prompts, resources, and sampling (with even more coming soon!) to enhance your Copilot experience by bringing in more context from your engineering stack. These powerful new features unlock deeper integrations with your favorite tools and services, making your development workflow more intelligent and context aware.\nTry MCP in Visual Studio\n\nLet’s dive into each of these features and discuss some examples with specific MCP servers that can truly level up your AI-coding experience.\nMCP Resources and Resource Templates: Access External Data Seamlessly\nModel Context Protocol also provides a standardized way for servers to expose resources to clients. Resources allow servers to share data that provides context to language models, such as files, database schemas, or application-specific information. Each resource is uniquely identified by a URI, allowing you to get even more out of your MCP servers and pull in context directly in the IDE.\nExample: Azure DevOps Work Items\nWhen working with Azure DevOps, you can now reference work items, user stories, and project data directly in your chat conversations. The Azure DevOps MCP server exposes resources like work item templates, sprint information, and team capacity data that Copilot can use to provide more contextual suggestions about your project planning and development tasks.\n\nUsing MCP Resources\nTo use any MCP resources available to you, reference them in Copilot chat the same way you would reference any other piece of context – with a hashtag (#) followed by the resource URI.\nResource Templates for Dynamic Content\nJust like with prompts, MCP resources can have arguments that you can fill in to customize the resource for your specific needs. These are called resource templates. To configure them:\nUse the + Reference button in chat\nSelect the MCP resource option from the menu\nChoose your resource template and fill in any required arguments\nClick Add Resource to make this MCP resource referenceable in chat\nExample: Figma Design Context\nFor teams working closely with design systems, the Figma MCP server allows you to reference design components, style guides, and design specifications directly in your development conversations. This bridges the gap between design and development by making design context readily available to Copilot.\n\nMCP Prompts and Prompt Templates: Get Better Responses with Specialized Instructions\nMCP Prompts allow servers to provide structured messages and instructions for interacting with language models that are catered to the use case and content of the server in question, ensuring that you will get the best responses for a certain task.\nHow to Use MCP Prompts\nVisual Studio now allows you to discover available prompts, retrieve their contents, and provide arguments to customize them. To reference any prompts that may come from an MCP server:\nClick the + Reference button in chat\nSelect the Prompts option\nChoose MCP prompts from the flyout\nYou’ll see a pop-up where you can select the prompt you’d like to use, then click Insert Prompt to include the text from this prompt in chat.\nPrompt Templates with Custom Arguments\nSome MCP prompts will have arguments that you can fill in to customize the prompt for your specific needs – these are known as prompt templates. If you select a prompt in the modal dialog that contains arguments, you’ll be able to specify those values before inserting the prompt into chat.\nExample: GitHub Integration\nImagine you’re working on code reviews and want to leverage GitHub’s specialized prompts. With the GitHub MCP server, you can access prompts specifically designed for analyzing pull requests, generating commit messages, or reviewing code changes. These prompts understand GitHub’s context and can provide more targeted assistance than generic prompts.\n\nMCP Sampling: Enabling Advanced Agentic Behaviors\nSampling in MCP allows servers to implement agentic behaviors by enabling LLM calls to occur nested inside other MCP server features. This powerful feature allows an MCP server to make requests of an LLM, rather than the typical workflow of an LLM requesting content from an MCP server. Visual Studio now supports this advanced capability, allowing your MCP servers to perform more complex, multi-step tasks on your behalf.\nHow Sampling works\nThere’s nothing to configure to take advantage of sampling – as long as your MCP server supports it, Visual Studio will too. When Copilot determines that a request would benefit from a sampling call, you’ll see a dialog containing all details of the request, asking you to confirm the sampling call before anything happens behind the scenes. This ensures you maintain full control over any automated actions.\nExample: Playwright testing scenarios \nThe Playwright MCP server can use sampling to automatically generate comprehensive test scenarios based on your application’s current state. When you ask for help with testing, it might sample your application’s DOM structure, analyze user flows, and then generate targeted test scripts that cover critical user paths – all through intelligent sampling calls that you approve.\n\nGetting Started\nThese new MCP capabilities are available now in Visual Studio. To get the most out of these features, we recommend exploring the MCP servers that align with your development workflow. Each server brings unique prompts, resources, and potentially sampling capabilities that can significantly enhance your Copilot experience.\nTry out some other popular MCP servers in Visual Studio with one-click:\n – Convert various file formats (PDF, Word, Excel, images, audio) to Markdown.\n – Query and analyze data in DuckDB databases locally and in the cloud.\n – Database operations and management. Execute queries, manage collections, aggregation pipelines, and document operations.\n – Access models, datasets, and Spaces on the Hugging Face Hub.\nThe seamless integration of external tools and services through MCP represents a major step forward in creating a truly connected development environment. By bringing context from your entire engineering stack directly into your IDE, these features help Copilot provide more accurate, relevant, and actionable assistance for your daily development tasks.\nGive us your feedback!\nWe’re excited to continue evolving the MCP experience in VS, and your input plays a big role—please give us your feedback here, and let us know what you’d like to see next!\nTry MCP in Visual Studio\n\nThe post Getting the most out of MCP in Visual Studio with Prompts, Resources, and Sampling appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "개요\n개인정보 보호의 중요성이 대두되면서 모바일 어트리뷰선의 패러다임은 크게 변화하였다. 과거에는 IDFA, GAID 등의 광고 식별자를 통해 명확한 측정이 가능하였으나, 사용자의 개인정보 보호를 최우선으로 하는 현대에는 더이상 Deterministic한 사용자 식별이 불가능하다.\n이 글에서는 Apple의 SKAdNetwork(SKAN)와 Google의 Privacy Sandbox로 대표하는 모바일 환경의 개인정보 보호 프레임워크에 대해 설명하고, 어떻게 확률론적으로 모바일 어트리뷰선을 획득하는지에 대해 알아보겠다.\n어떻게 알고 오셨어요?\n1970년대, 미국 디트로이트의 자동차 판매원 ‘조 지라드(Joe Girard)’는 15년간 13,001대의 차를 팔아 ‘세계에서 가장 위대한 세일즈맨’으로 기네스북에 올랐다.\n그의 성공 비결은 차를 파는 기술이 아니라, 고객을 끊임없이 만들어내는 ‘시스템’에 있었다. 그는 자신의 고객이 될 만한 사람을 소개해 주는 사람들을 ‘버드 도그(Bird Dogs, 사냥개)’ 라고 불렀다. 이발사, 식당 주인, 은행원 등 주변의 모든 사람이 그의 ‘버드 도그’가 될 수 있었다.\n그의 규칙은 간단했다. “저에게 손님을 보내주십시오. 그 손님이 차를 사면, 제가 바로 당신에게 25달러를 보내드리겠습니다.”\n이 시스템이 완벽하게 돌아가려면 가장 중요한 전제 조건이 있었다. 바로 “이 고객을 누가 보냈는가?” 를 한 치의 오차도 없이 파악하는 것이었다.\n조 지라드는 새로운 고객이 오면 가장 먼저 “누가 당신을 제게 보냈습니까?”라고 물었다. 그리고 판매가 성사되면 장부에 꼼꼼히 기록해 두었다가, 약속한 25달러를 소개자에게 반드시 보냈다.\n조 지라드의 일화와 마찬가지로 모바일 앱 서비스 생태계에서는 어떤 광고활동이나 마케팅이 고객의 유입이나 결제로 이어졌는지 추적하고 그 공로를 찾아내는데, 그 과정을 Mobile Attribution 이라고 한다.\nDeterministic Attribution\nAttribution을 정확히 측정하는 것은 매우 중요하다. 이 손님이 이발사의 소개를 받고 왔는지, 은행원의 소개를 받고 왔는지를 알아야 누구에게 얼마의 광고료를 줄지 판단할 수 있기 때문이다.\n‘이 손님은 누구의 소개를 받고 왔는가?’ 이 질문에 답하기 위해 모바일 플랫폼은 Ad Network에게 다음 정보를 전달하였다.\nIDFA (Identifier for Advertisers): Apple이 iOS 기기를 위해 제공하는, 사용자가 재설정할 수 있는 광고 식별자\nGAID (Google Advertising ID): Google이 Google Play 서비스가 설치된 Android 기기를 위해 제공하는 광고 식별자\nIDFA, GAID는 모두 사용자의 기기를 정확히 식별할 수 있는 고유의 값이다. 따라서 IDFA 와 GAID 를 알면 정확한 Mobile Attribution을 획득할 수 있다.\n사용자가 광고를 클릭\nAd Network는 해당 기기의 IDFA / GAID를 캡처 후 저장\n사용자가 앱을 설치, 처음으로 실행\n100% 정확한 사용자 유입 경로를 알 수 있는 Attribution 획득\n이러한 Deterministic 한 Attribution 획득 방식으로 인해, 광고주들은 어떤 광고가 어떤 사용자를 유입시켰는지에 대한 명확한 데이터를 확보할 수 있었고, 이는 모바일 광고 생태계를 성장시키는 기반이었다. 하지만 이제 공짜점심은 끝났다. 모바일 플랫폼의 개인정보 보호 강화 기조 아래, 사용자 동의 없이 Deterministic Attribution 획득은 불가능하다. 이 글을 읽고 있는 당신도 그러겠지만, 사용자들은 더 이상 나를 특정할 수 있는 개인정보 제공에 동의하지 않는다.\nProbabilistic Attribution\nApple의 ATT(AppTrackingTransparency)와 SKAN(SKAdNetwork) Framework\n상술하였듯, 애플은 더 이상 사용자 동의 없이 IDFA를 제공하지 않는다.(정확히 말하면 ‘명시적인’ 사용자 동의 없이).\n\n\n\n\n따라서 iOS14+ 이후부터는 기기의 IDFA 값을 가져오려면 ATT(AppTrackingTransparency) 프레임워크를 통해 반드시 명시적으로 사용자의 권한을 획득하여야 한다. 사용자가 동의를 거부하면 상기 스샷과 같이 IDFA 값은 000000~ 으로 비워진다.\n이는 광고주 및 Ad Network 모두에게 치명적인 문제다. 내 광고가 누구에 의해 노출이 되었는지 명확히 알지 못하기 때문에 어느 경로를 통해 고객이 유입되었는지 파악할 수 없고, 광고 비즈니스의 대전제(어떻게 알고 오셨어요?)가 무너지게 된다.\n대안으로, 애플은 개인을 특정할 수는 없는 제한된 정보를 제공하는 광고 식별자 획득 방식을 제공하는데, 그것이 SKAN(SKAdNetwork)이다.\n\n\n\n\nSKAN 의 데이터 흐름은 다음과 같다.\nAd Network: 광고를 개제\nAd Network: 제한된 Attribution(Postback) 수집 URL 등록\n사용자: 광고를 클릭 -> 앱 설치\nApple: 광고사업자가 개인 추적이 어렵도록 일정 기간 지연(~최대 144시간)\nAd Network: 일정시간 경과 후 Postback 으로 캠페인 ID 및 제한된 사용자 정보(Conversion Value) 수신(IDFA 없음)\n여기서 유일하게 사용자 정보를 얻어낼 수단은 CV(Conversion Value) 뿐이다. CV는 0~63 사이의 정수로 표현되는 6bit 값으로, 광고주는 64 가지 값에 매핑하여 사용자의 앱 설치 후 행동을 수집할 수 있다. 예를 들어 CV가 1이면 튜토리얼 완료, CV가 2이면 최초 인앱 구매 완료 등의 값을 사전에 정의, Postback 시점에 획득하여 사용자를 분석할 수 있다. 알고 있겠지만 6bit 는 메우 제한된 값으로, CV를 단독으로 이용하여 사용자를 특정할 방법은 없다.\n말하자면 Apple 은 데이터 측정의 심판이자 유일한 처리자 역할을 자처한다. 광고주, Ad Network 는 모두 Apple 이 정해둔 엄격한 규칙 안에서 Apple이 제공하는 최종 결과물을 수동적으로 받아 해석해야 한다.\nAndroid 의 Privacy Sandbox와 Attribution Reporting API\n앞서 Apple이 모든 Attribution 획득 경로에 관여, 통제하면서 결과만 전달하는 방식과는 대조적으로, Google은 광고 생태계 참여자들이 개인정보 보호 기술을 기반으로 자체적인 프라이버시 보호 솔루션을 구축할 수 있도록 빌딩블록을 제공한다. 그 핵심 빌딩블록이 바로 Privacy Sandbox 이다.\nPrivacy Sandbox는 다음 3가지 핵심 목표를 갖는다.\n기존의 추적 메커니즘을 대체할 새로운 개인정보 보호기술을 구축하는 것.\n퍼블리셔와 개발자가 침해적인 추적 없이도 무료 온라인 컨텐츠를 계속 제공할 수 있도록 지원하는 것.\n업계와의 협력을 통해 새로운 인터넷 개인정보 보호 표준을 구축하는 것.\n요약하면, 개인정보를 보호하면서도 퍼블리셔와 개발자가 광고 기반 비즈니스를 지속할 수 있도록 하는 업계 표준을 만드는 것이다.\n\n\n\n\nGoogle의 Privacy Sandbox가 기존의 Attribution 획득방식과 기술적으로 가장 크게 구별되는 부분은 사용자 디바이스 안에서 Ad Network 정보와 매칭되는 Attribution을 만들어낸다는 점이다.\n디바이스 안에서 Attribution을 획득하기 때문에 광고 비즈니스 사업자는 사용자의 개인정보를 디바이스 밖으로 빼내지 넘기지 않고도 유의미한 사용자 전환 정보를 얻을 수 있다.\n이렇게 사용자 단말에서 생성된 익명화된 Attribution은 Attribution Reporting API(줄여서 ARA)를 통해 수집된다.\nARA를 통해 수집되는 리포트는 크게 2가지 유형이 존재한다.\nEvent-Level Report: “어떤 광고가 전환을 유도했는가?”와 같이 제한적이지만 세분화된 정보\nSummary Reports: “캠페인의 총매출액과 ROI는 얼마인가?”와 같이 구매 금액 등 상세한 전환 데이터를 암호화 및 집계된 형태로 제공\nEvent Level Report는 익명화된 개별 정보이다. 개별정보이지만 익명화 되어 있기 때문에 많은 정보가 담겨있지는 않다. Attribution 정보와 사용자 클릭, 조회 등의 이벤트를 매핑한 데이터를 제공한다. 이 리포트는 캠페인 도달율 측정이나 Attribution 집계 등의 용도로 적합하다.\n반면, Summary Report는 사용자 데이터를 집계한 통계 결과물이다. 개별화된 정보는 없지만 전환가치, ROI, 사용자 세그먼트 별 캠페인 성과분석 등 깊이있는 리포트를 제공한다.\n이 데이터들은 암호화된 형태(=encrypted aggregatable report)로 Ad tech platform(Appsflyer, Meta, Applovin 등등..)에게 전달되며, 이 암호화된 데이터를 기반으로 필요한 쿼리를 Cloud Trusted Execution Environment에 위치한 Aggregation Service 에 질의한다.\nCloud Trusted Execution Environment(TEE)?\nTEE란 구글에서 제안하는 보안 기준을 충족하는 & 신뢰할만한 클라우드 제공자의 인프라 위에서 동작하는 격리된 환경이다. TEE의 보안 기준을 충족하면 Ad Tech Platform 기업에서 자체적으로 구축, 운영할 수 있다.\nExecutive Summary\n지금까지 개인정보 보호의 시대에 어떻게 Mobile Attribution 획득 과정이 달라지는지에 대하여 알아보았다. 과거처럼 Deterministic하게 Attribution을 획득하던 시대는 끝났으며 개발자를 포함, 각 이해관계자들은 개인정보 보호의 시대의 Attribution 획득 방식을 준비해야 한다.\n결정론적 시대의 종말: 개인정보 보호 강화로 IDFA, GAID 기반의 1:1 사용자 추적이 불가능해졌다.\n확률론적 시대로의 전환: 이제는 명확한 데이터 대신, 제한된 데이터를 바탕으로 성과를 ‘추론’해야 한다.\nApple (SKAN)의 접근: Apple이 모든 과정을 통제하는 ‘블랙박스’ 방식이다.\nGoogle (샌드박스)의 접근: ‘온디바이스 매칭’ 을 핵심으로, 광고 생태계가 활용할 수 있는 ‘빌딩 블록’ 을 제공한다.\nAd Tech의 역할 변화: MMP, 광고 네트워크 등 Ad Tech는 암호화된 리포트를 받아, 직접 클라우드 보안 환경(TEE)에 ‘Aggregation Service’ 를 구축하고 운영하여 데이터를 처리해야 한다.",

        "contentSnippet": "30년 검색의 종말? 구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순한 검색 기능 업그레이드를 넘어 검색 생태계와 AI 산업 전반에 근본적인 변화를 가져오고 있습니다. 2025년 한국에 정식 출시된 제미나이 2.5 기반의 이 혁신적인 도구가 어떻게 우리의 정보 탐색 방식을 바꾸고, 미래 검색의 방향을 제시하는지 자세히 알아봅니다.\n  구글 AI 모드, 도대체 무엇이 다르죠?\n\n\n음, 2025년 9월 한국에 정식 출시된 구글 AI 모드는 정말이지 기존 검색의 판도를 완전히 뒤집는다고 해도 과언이 아니에요. 단순히 몇몇 기능을 추가한 수준이 아니라, 검색 생태계와 AI 산업 전반에 걸쳐 근본적인 변화를 가져올 혁신적인 도구라고 저는 생각합니다. 제미나이 2.5 맞춤형 버전을 기반으로 하는 이 AI 모드는 사실 기존 AI Overview의 확장된 개념인데요, 가장 핵심적인 특징은 바로 '쿼리 팬-아웃(query fan-out)' 기술이 아닐까 싶어요.\n이 기술, 정말 대단하죠. 사용자가 복잡한 질문을 던지면 AI가 이를 여러 개의 하위 주제로 똑똑하게 분해합니다. 그리고는 각 주제에 대해 동시에 검색을 수행해서 종합적이고 아주 풍부한 답변을 척척 만들어내죠. 예를 들어, 저도 해봤는데, \"7세와 4세 아이 2명과 서울에서 1시간 거리로 주말에 함께 갈 수 있는 한적한 여행지\" 같은 복잡한 요청도 한 번에 깔끔하게 처리해주더라고요. 이런 경험은 기존 검색에서는 상상하기 어려웠던 부분이죠. 솔직히 말하면, 제가 겪어본 바로는 정말 혁신적이에요!\n멀티모달 검색 경험의 확장\n구글 AI 모드는 텍스트만 처리하는 것이 아니라, 음성과 이미지까지 지원하는 진정한 멀티모달 검색 경험을 제공합니다. 마이크 버튼 하나로 음성 질문을 하거나, 구글 렌즈와 연동해서 사진 한 장만으로도 복잡한 질문을 할 수 있어요. 얼마 전 해외여행에서 써봤는데, 식당 메뉴판을 사진으로 찍고 \"채식주의자가 먹을 수 있는 메뉴 알려줘\"라고 물으니, 번역은 물론이고 조건에 맞는 추천까지 해주더라고요. 정말이지 여행의 질이 달라지는 경험이었어요!\n딥 서치와 개인 맞춤형 기능으로 한 단계 더!\n여기서 끝이 아닙니다. AI 모드에서는 수백 건의 검색을 동시에 진행해서 전문가 수준의 완벽한 보고서를 단 몇 분 만에 생성하는 딥 서치(Deep Search) 기능도 제공해요. 저처럼 리서치를 많이 하는 사람들에게는 정말이지 빛과 소금 같은 기능이죠. 그리고 사용자의 동의하에 지메일 등 다른 구글 앱과 연동하여 개인 정보를 활용한 맞춤형 답변까지 제공하는데, 이건 정말 개인 비서가 생긴 기분이에요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 기술 요약: 구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 쿼리 팬-아웃 기술로 복잡한 질문을 세분화하여 동시에 검색합니다. 음성/이미지 인식 멀티모달 기능과 수백 건의 동시 검색을 통한 딥 서치 기능이 핵심입니다.\n⚙️ AI 모드, 실생활에서 어떻게 활용할까요?\n구글 AI 모드는 단순히 기술만 발전한 것이 아니라, 우리의 일상과 업무 여러 분야에서 엄청난 잠재력을 가지고 있어요. 제가 직접 써보고 느낀 점들과 함께 몇 가지 활용법을 소개해 드릴게요.\n비즈니스 및 마케팅 분야에서 똑똑하게!\n비즈니스 환경에서 AI 모드는 정말 유용합니다. \"B2B 스타트업을 위한 통합 마케팅 자동화 솔루션 추천해줘\"와 같은 질문을 던져보세요. AI는 이 질문을 'B2B 특화 기능', '스타트업 예산 대응', '마케팅 자동화 도구 비교', '통합 솔루션 장점' 등으로 아주 세분화하여 검색하고, 관련 정보를 깔끔하게 정리해줍니다. 마치 전문 컨설턴트가 짧은 시간 안에 핵심 보고서를 만들어주는 느낌이랄까요? 제가 전에 리서치하던 시간의 절반도 안 걸려서 놀랐어요.\n여행 및 생활 정보 검색도 문제없죠!\n복잡한 여행 계획 수립이나 일상생활 정보 검색에서도 AI 모드의 강점이 빛을 발합니다. \"내년 5월에 열리는 철인 3종 경기를 준비하려고 해. 훈련 시작 전에 알아야 할 점은 무엇이야?\" 같은 다층적인 질문에도 훈련 계획, 영양, 장비, 부상 예방 등 종합적인 답변을 제공해요. 저는 다음 주말 여행 계획을 AI 모드로 짜봤는데, 숙소부터 맛집, 아이들 체험 활동까지 정말 완벽하게 추천해주더라고요. 솔직히 감탄했습니다.\n학술 연구 및 교육 분야의 혁신\n학술 연구와 교육 분야에서도 AI 모드는 혁신적인 도구로 자리매김하고 있습니다. 이제는 이미지나 PDF 파일에 대한 질문 분석 기능이 데스크톱으로도 확장되어, 강의 슬라이드를 업로드하고 관련 질문을 하는 것이 가능해졌어요. 학생들은 복잡한 논문 내용을 빠르게 이해하고, 연구자들은 방대한 자료를 효율적으로 탐색할 수 있게 되는 거죠. 제가 학교 다닐 때 이런 기능이 있었다면 성적이 훨씬 좋았을 것 같아요. (웃음)\n콘텐츠 생성 및 최적화에도 탁월!\nAI 모드는 콘텐츠 마케터들에게도 강력한 도구가 됩니다. 예를 들어, \"네이버 블로그 상위노출 기사 10개의 제목을 분석하고, 이들 기사보다 상위노출이 가능한 최적의 블로그 제목을 생성해줘\"와 같은 요청을 통해 경쟁사 분석과 함께 SEO에 최적화된 제목을 손쉽게 얻을 수 있습니다. 이는 콘텐츠 기획 시간을 크게 단축시키고, 더욱 효과적인 마케팅 전략을 수립하는 데 도움을 줍니다.\n\n\n\n \n시의성 있는 정보 검색 및 기사 작성까지!\n최신 시사 이슈나 정책에 대한 정보가 필요할 때도 AI 모드를 활용할 수 있습니다. \"정부의 2025년 추석 민생 안정대책에 대한 신뢰할 수 있는 자료를 검색하고 블로그 기사를 생성해 (검색대상에 블로그를 제외해)\"와 같이 특정 조건을 지정하여 정보를 요청하면, AI가 신뢰도 높은 자료를 기반으로 관련 기사 초안을 작성해줍니다. 이를 통해 빠르고 정확하게 필요한 정보를 얻고, 생산적인 작업으로 이어갈 수 있습니다.\n\n\n\n \n⚔️ LLM 시장의 격전, 그리고 구글의 전략\n구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순히 검색 기능의 변화를 넘어, 전체 AI 검색 시장의 경쟁을 더욱 치열하게 만들고 있어요. ChatGPT의 SearchGPT, Perplexity AI, Bing AI 등 각자의 강점을 내세우는 경쟁자들이 이미 많이 존재하거든요. 이런 상황에서 구글이 본격적으로 AI 검색 서비스를 도입했다는 건, 시장 판도에 상당한 변화를 가져올 것이라는 의미로 해석될 수 있죠. 제 생각에는 구글이 검색 시장의 주도권을 절대 놓치지 않겠다는 강력한 의지를 보여준 것 같아요.\n⚠️ 주목할 점: 일부 전문가들은 AI 검색이 기존 구글의 검색 점유율 33%를 빼앗아올 수 있다고 분석합니다. 라이너는 학술 검색, Perplexity는 미디어 종사자와 리서처 사이에서 인기를 얻고 있으며, ChatGPT는 LLM 이용자들의 검색 습관을 바꾸고 있어요. 구글도 마냥 안심할 수만은 없는 상황이죠.\nLLM 시장의 자연독점 가능성\n최근 AI 업계에서는 \"LLM 시장이 구글처럼 자연독점이 될 수 있다\"는 전망이 조심스럽게 제기되고 있습니다. 구글의 AI 모드 도입은 이러한 자연독점 구조를 더욱 공고히 할 가능성이 크다고 저는 봐요. 구글이 보유한 강력한 검색 인프라와 방대한 데이터, 그리고 제미나이 2.5 같은 최첨단 AI 모델을 결합하면 경쟁자들이 쉽게 따라잡기 어려운 격차를 만들어낼 수 있겠죠. 아, 그런데 이건 독점이라는 측면에서는 우려가 될 수도 있겠네요.\n\n\n플랫폼별 검색 경험의 분화\nLLM이 모든 앱에 검색 기능을 주입하면서, 이제 검색은 더 이상 Google.com에서만 시작되거나 끝나지 않게 되었습니다. Microsoft Excel에서 쿠키 레시피를 검색하거나, Meta AI를 통해 WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook에서도 검색할 수 있게 되었으니 말이죠. 구글은 이제 ChatGPT뿐만 아니라 수천 개의 작은 AI 검색 엔진들과도 경쟁해야 하는 상황에 놓인 겁니다. 검색의 정의 자체가 확장되고 있다는 느낌이에요.\n  검색 엔진 생태계에 미치는 혁명적 영향\n구글 AI 모드의 도입은 정말이지 검색 생태계 전반에 혁명적인 변화를 가져오고 있다고 저는 확신합니다. 우리 모두의 검색 습관부터 웹사이트 트래픽, 그리고 SEO 전략까지, 모든 것이 바뀌고 있어요.\n검색 행동 패턴의 근본적 변화\nAI Overview가 출시된 이후, 사용자들은 기존 검색보다 2~3배 긴 질문을 하기 시작했어요. 이건 AI가 자연어를 정말 잘 이해할 수 있다는 신뢰가 형성되었기 때문입니다. 전체 검색의 약 20% 정도가 '롱테일 키워드'(요구 사항이 구체적인 긴 검색어)를 차지하는데, 이 비율은 계속 증가하는 추세예요. 이제 사람들은 \"CRM 추천\" 같은 짧은 키워드 대신 \"중소기업에서 사용하기 쉬운 클라우드 기반 CRM 솔루션을 추천해줘\"와 같이 더 자연스러운 문장으로 검색하게 된 거죠. 제가 생각하기에 이런 변화는 정보 탐색의 효율성을 극대화할 거예요.\n제로 클릭 검색 확산과 웹 트래픽의 변화\nAI Overview와 AI 모드의 도입으로 이제 제로 클릭 검색이 더욱 일반화되고 있습니다. 사용자들이 검색 결과에서 바로 답을 얻을 수 있으니, 웹사이트 클릭률(CTR)이 낮아지고 자연 검색 트래픽이 줄어들 가능성이 커졌어요. 최근 데이터에 따르면 전 세계 검색 트래픽이 15% 감소했다는 분석도 있는데, 이게 바로 AI 검색 기능 강화의 영향이라고 합니다. 콘텐츠 제작자들에게는 정말 중요한 변화죠.\nSEO 전략의 패러다임 전환\nAI 검색의 도입은 SEO 전략에 근본적인 변화를 요구하고 있습니다. 이제는 단순히 키워드 최적화를 넘어서, AI가 이해하고 종합할 수 있는 '정보의 질'과 '구조'가 훨씬 더 중요해졌어요. 기업들은 키워드를 통한 검색 최적화에만 매달릴 것이 아니라, AI의 분석 능력을 활용하여 소비자의 실제 요구와 행동 패턴에 맞춘 고품질 콘텐츠 제공에 집중해야 합니다. 이건 마치 새로운 게임의 규칙을 배우는 것과 같아요. 쉬운 일은 아니지만, 반드시 적응해야 합니다.\n\n\n검색 결과의 투명성과 신뢰도 향상\n구글은 AI 모드의 투명성을 높이기 위해 Search Console에 AI 모드에서의 클릭, 노출, 순위 데이터를 통합했어요. 이를 통해 게시자와 사이트 소유자들이 AI 모드가 검색 결과에 미치는 영향을 더 정확하게 파악할 수 있게 되었죠. 게다가 AI 모드는 구글의 기존 품질 및 순위 시스템을 기반으로 작동하며, 신뢰도가 낮을 경우 기존 웹 검색 결과를 그대로 보여주는 보완 장치까지 마련했습니다. AI 답변의 품질이나 유용성에 대한 신뢰도가 충분히 높지 않다면 웹 링크를 제공하여 사용자가 직접 검증할 수 있도록 지원하는 점도 아주 긍정적인 부분이라고 생각해요.\n  핵심 요약\n구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 '쿼리 팬-아웃' 기술로 복잡한 질문을 세분화하여 동시 처리, 기존 검색의 한계를 뛰어넘습니다.\n멀티모달 검색 (음성, 이미지) 및 딥 서치 기능으로 개인 맞춤형, 전문가 수준의 정보를 제공하며 활용 범위를 넓히고 있습니다.\nAI 검색 시장의 경쟁 심화와 LLM 시장의 자연독점 가능성 속에서, 구글은 강력한 인프라로 주도권을 유지하려 합니다.\n제로 클릭 검색 확산, 웹 트래픽 변화, 그리고 '정보의 질'과 '구조' 중심의 SEO 전략 패러다임 전환이 필수적입니다.\n* 미래 검색 환경에 대한 적응과 활용이 중요합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 구글 AI 모드는 기존 검색과 무엇이 다른가요?\nA1: 구글 AI 모드는 제미나이 2.5 기반의 '쿼리 팬-아웃' 기술을 활용하여 사용자의 복잡한 질문을 여러 하위 주제로 분해, 동시에 검색하고 종합적인 답변을 제공합니다. 이는 기존 검색 엔진이 개별 링크를 나열하는 방식과는 근본적으로 다른, 개인 맞춤형 '답변' 중심의 경험을 선사합니다.\nQ2: AI 모드의 등장으로 SEO 전략은 어떻게 바뀌어야 할까요?\nA2: AI 모드 시대에는 단순한 키워드 최적화를 넘어, AI가 이해하고 종합할 수 있는 '정보의 질'과 '구조'가 가장 중요해집니다. 사용자 질문에 대한 포괄적이고 신뢰성 높은 답변을 제공하며, AI가 콘텐츠를 쉽게 분석하고 활용할 수 있도록 명확하게 구조화된 콘텐츠 제작이 필수적입니다.\nQ3: AI 모드가 웹사이트 트래픽에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가요?\nA3: AI 모드의 도입으로 '제로 클릭 검색'이 확산될 수 있습니다. AI가 검색 결과에서 바로 종합적인 답변을 제공하기 때문에, 사용자들이 웹사이트를 직접 클릭할 필요가 줄어들어 자연 검색 트래픽이 감소할 가능성이 있습니다. 이는 콘텐츠 제작자들이 단순히 클릭 유도를 넘어 정보 가치 자체에 집중해야 함을 의미합니다.\nQ4: 구글 AI 모드의 미래는 어떻게 전망되나요?\nA4: 구글은 AI 모드를 지속적으로 개선하고 기능을 확장할 계획입니다. 단순한 검색 도구를 넘어 캔버스 기능, 검색 라이브, 개인 맞춤형 차트 및 그래프 생성 등 종합적인 정보 분석 및 생성 플랫폼으로 발전할 것입니다. 궁극적으로는 인덱스 중심의 검색 엔진에서 사용자 의도에 응답하는 '답변 엔진'으로의 전환을 가속화할 것으로 예상됩니다.\n마무리하며: 검색 생태계의 새로운 시대\n구글 AI 모드의 등장은 단순히 기술적 진보를 넘어, 30년간 지속되어온 전통적인 검색 방식의 패러다임을 완전히 바꾸는 중요한 이정표라고 생각합니다. AI 기반의 대화형 검색으로 진화하면서 사용자들은 훨씬 더 자연스럽고 효율적인 정보 탐색 경험을 얻게 될 것이 분명해요.\n물론 이러한 변화는 다른 LLM 서비스들과의 경쟁을 더욱 치열하게 만들고 있으며, 각 플랫폼이 고유한 강점을 내세워 시장에서 경쟁하는 상황을 만들어내고 있죠. 동시에 검색 엔진 시장에서는 SEO 전략의 근본적 변화, 제로 클릭 검색의 확산, 그리고 웹 트래픽 패턴의 변화 등 다양한 영향이 나타나고 있습니다. 적응하지 않으면 도태될 수밖에 없을 거예요.\n앞으로 AI 검색 기술이 더욱 발전하고 확산됨에 따라, 콘텐츠 제작자들과 마케터들은 AI가 이해하고 활용할 수 있는 고품질 콘텐츠 제작에 더욱 집중해야 할 것입니다. 그리고 우리 사용자들은 AI가 제공하는 정보의 신뢰성을 비판적으로 검증하고, 다양한 출처를 통해 정보를 확인하는 능력을 기르는 것이 중요하다고 생각해요. 구글 AI 모드가 보여주는 검색의 미래, 이 거대한 변화에 적응하고 활용하는 능력이 바로 다가올 디지털 환경에서 성공하는 핵심 요소가 될 거라고 저는 감히 말씀드립니다. 정말 기대되지 않나요?\n⁂",

'나노바나나'가 무엇인가요?\n나노바나나는 구글 Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 모델의 커뮤니티 별명이에요. 이 혁신적인 AI 모델은 캐릭터 일관성 유지, 다중 이미지 합성, 정확한 텍스트 표현 같은 놀라운 기능들을 자랑합니다. 오래된 사진 복원, 이미지 속 물체 제거, 여러 이미지를 자연스럽게 합성하는 등 정말 다양한 작업이 가능해서 많은 크리에이터들이 주목하고 있죠.\n분명 AI 이미지 생성이나 편집할 때 어떤 프롬프트를 써야 할지 막막했던 경험, 한 번쯤 있으실 거예요. 복잡한 프롬프트 작성에 시간을 허비하거나, 원하는 결과물을 얻기 위해 수없이 시도하며 좌절했던 순간들... 이제 걱정 마세요! 이 앱 하나면 여러분의 그런 고민을 시원하게 해결해 드릴 수 있을 거라고 확신합니다.\n  나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 왜 지금 필요할까요?\n현재 많은 분들이 나노바나나 프롬프트를 활용하기 위해 전문가들이 공유한 웹사이트를 직접 방문하고, 마음에 드는 프롬프트를 일일이 복사해서 Gemini나 AI STUDIO 같은 툴에 붙여넣어 실행하는 번거로운 과정을 거치고 계실 거예요. 이런 수작업은 시간이 많이 들 뿐만 아니라, 168개나 되는 프롬프트를 모두 효율적으로 관리하기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니죠.\n그래서 저는 이런 불편함을 완전히 해소하고 싶었습니다. 168개의 프롬프트를 단 하나의 웹앱에서 한눈에 보고, 클릭 몇 번으로 원하는 기법을 선택해서 바로 테스트해볼 수 있는 혁신적인 도구, 바로 '나노바나나 쇼케이스 앱'을 개발하게 된 배경입니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분의 AI 이미지 작업이 훨씬 더 빠르고, 편리하고, 즐거워질 거라 기대해요.\n ️ 나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 , 개발 과정 엿보기\n이 앱이 탄생하기까지 어떤 과정들을 거쳤는지 궁금하지 않으신가요? 제 생각엔, 이러한 개발 과정이 여러분이 직접 AI 앱을 만들 때도 좋은 참고가 될 수 있을 것 같아요. 몇 단계를 거쳐 이 편리한 앱이 완성되었는지 함께 살펴보시죠!\n1단계: 핵심 재료, 프롬프트 데이터 준비\n모든 요리에 좋은 재료가 필요하듯, 앱 개발의 첫걸음은 바로 '핵심 재료'인 프롬프트 모음을 준비하는 것이었어요. 전 세계 전문가들이 나노바나나를 활용해 만든 결과물과 프롬프트가 공유된 깃허브(GitHub) 저장소에서 이 귀중한 데이터들을 수집했습니다. 각 케이스별로 어떤 결과물이 나오는지, 그리고 어떤 프롬프트가 사용되었는지 꼼꼼하게 확인하는 과정이 필요했죠.\n특히, 데이터를 효과적으로 사용하려면 그 구조를 미리 파악하는 게 중요합니다. 케이스 제목, 만든이 정보, 상세 설명, 그리고 핵심 프롬프트가 어떻게 구성되어 있는지 분석하는 데 시간을 들였어요. 이렇게 정리된 데이터가 앱의 뼈대가 되었습니다.\n2단계: UI/UX 디자인, 스케치부터 시작!\n요즘 LLM(거대 언어 모델)들은 멀티모달 기능을 기본적으로 지원하는 경우가 많잖아요? 그래서 저는 그림판으로 앱의 UI를 대략적으로 스케치해서 업로드하는 방식을 택했습니다. 인터페이스 디자인을 직접 그리는 것만으로도 LLM이 이를 기반으로 앱을 만들어 줄 수 있다는 점이 정말 놀라웠어요!\n저는 화면을 크게 세 부분으로 나누었어요. 왼쪽에는 CASE 목록을, 중앙에는 이미지를 편집하는 작업 목록을, 그리고 오른쪽에는 결과물을 출력하도록 말이죠. 이렇게 작업 프로세스의 순서대로 한 화면에 구성하면 사용자가 훨씬 직관적으로 앱을 사용할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n3단계: 성공적인 앱 개발을 위한 사전 고려사항\n본격적인 앱 개발에 앞서 몇 가지 중요한 고려사항을 정리했습니다. 이 과정을 거치면 처음 시도하는 작업에서도 비교적 원하는 결과물을 얻을 확률이 높아져요.\n한글 앱 지원: 사용자 편의성을 위해 당연히 한글로 앱이 구동되어야 했습니다.\n카테고리 분류: 168개나 되는 CASE를 무작정 나열하면 사용성이 떨어질 테니, 카테고리별 분류가 필수였죠.\n컨텍스트 용량 고려: AI 코딩 시 컨텍스트 용량은 아주 중요한데요. 168개 CASE의 제목과 프롬프트가 모두 하나의 파일에 들어가면 에러가 발생하거나 수정이 어려울 수 있습니다. 이를 분할하는 전략이 필요했어요.\n원문 프롬프트 유지: 한글 앱이지만, AI 이미지 생성의 최적 결과물을 위해서는 프롬프트는 원문 그대로 영어로 유지해야 한다는 점을 인지했습니다.\n4단계: AI Studio 앱빌더와 함께하는 구현 과정\n이제 그림판 스케치와 정리된 데이터를 가지고 AI Studio 앱빌더로 향했습니다. 미리 그려둔 UI 이미지를 업로드하고, 프롬프트 데이터가 담긴 `README.md` 파일을 `txt` 확장자로 변경하여 함께 올렸어요. 그리고 대화창에 \"2개 문서에 있는 CASE 별 프롬프트를 이용한 나노바나나를 활용한 이미지 생성 편집 한글 앱\"이라고 입력하며, 앞서 메모장에 정리한 요청사항들을 상세히 덧붙여 앱 생성을 요청했습니다.\n처음 앱이 생성되었을 때는 아쉬움이 좀 있었어요. 왼쪽 CASE 목록에 168개보다 훨씬 적은 수의 케이스만 보였거든요. 하지만 걱정 마세요! AI와의 대화는 계속됩니다. 저는 곧바로 \"2개 파일에 총 168개의 CASE가 있어. 누락되는 CASE 없이 모두 적용해. CASE가 너무 많아 소스 DATA도 카테고리별로 생성해\"라고 다시 요청했습니다. 잠시 후, 모든 CASE가 완벽하게 적용된 것을 확인했고, '일러스트를 피규어로' 같은 기능을 테스트해보니 동작도 제대로 하는 것을 알 수 있었습니다. 아, 정말 뿌듯하더라고요!\n✨ 사용자 경험을 극대화하는 앱 기능 업그레이드\n앱이 기본적인 형태를 갖추었으니, 이제 사용자 경험을 한층 더 끌어올릴 시간이었어요. 몇 가지 핵심 기능을 추가하고 개선하는 과정을 거쳤습니다.\n\n\n1단계: 결과물 확대 및 다운로드 기능 추가\n처음에는 생성된 이미지가 너무 작아서 불편하다는 생각이 들었어요. 그래서 \"결과물을 클릭하면 확대하고 다운로드 버튼을 추가해\"라고 요청했습니다. 놀랍게도 클릭 시 이미지가 확대되고, 한 번의 클릭으로 이미지를 저장할 수 있는 다운로드 버튼까지 완벽하게 추가되었습니다. 사소하지만 정말 편리한 기능이죠!\n2단계: 카테고리 시각화 및 넘버링으로 가독성 향상\n168개의 프롬프트는 결코 적은 수가 아니잖아요? CASE 목록의 카테고리 명이 눈에 잘 띄지 않아 불편할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요. \"카테고리명을 눈에 더 잘 띄게 버튼 형태로 변경해\"라는 요청과 함께, \"CASE에 넘버를 추가해\"라고 요청했습니다. 덕분에 이제 원하는 프롬프트를 훨씬 빠르고 쉽게 찾을 수 있게 되었습니다.\n3단계: AI 프롬프트 제안 기능으로 창작의 날개를 달다!\n이 앱의 가장 강력한 기능 중 하나가 바로 'AI 프롬프트 제안' 기능이라고 생각해요. 기존 프롬프트만 사용하는 것을 넘어, 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 추가 요청사항에 맞춰 AI가 개선된 프롬프트를 제안해주도록 요청했습니다.\n예를 들어, CASE 6번 '캐릭터 디자인'으로 테스트해봤어요. 기본 프롬프트는 입력한 이미지를 다양한 포즈의 디자인 시트로 만들어주는 것인데, 여기에 '교복 대신 체육복'이라는 추가 입력을 하고 AI에게 프롬프트를 제안받아 실행해보니, 와! 이미지에 체육복이 제대로 적용되는 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다. 이건 정말 창작의 가능성을 무한히 넓혀주는 기능이라고 할 수 있죠!\n4단계: 최종 마무리! 패널 조절 및 웹페이지 링크\n마지막으로, 사용자의 편의를 위해 메인 3개 패널의 폭을 자유롭게 조절할 수 있도록 했어요. 그리고 각 CASE별 실제 사용법을 자세히 볼 수 있도록 해당 웹페이지의 링크까지 추가하여 앱을 완벽하게 마무리했습니다. 이 작은 디테일들이 모여 사용자에게 큰 만족감을 줄 거라고 믿어요.\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n✔ 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱 무료 공개: AI 이미지 작업을 위한 필수 도구!\n✔ Gemini 2.5 Flash Image 모델 완벽 활용: 혁신적인 AI 이미지 생성 및 편집 가능.\n✔ 직관적인 웹앱 인터페이스: 168개 프롬프트를 한눈에, 클릭 한 번으로 실행.\n✔ AI 프롬프트 제안 기능: 사용자의 요청과 이미지를 기반으로 최적화된 프롬프트 자동 생성.\n이 앱은 AI 이미지 작업의 효율성을 극대화하고 창작의 재미를 더해줄 것입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 어떻게 사용할 수 있나요?\nA1: 앱은 웹 기반으로 제공되며, 별도의 설치 없이 인터넷 브라우저를 통해 접속할 수 있습니다. 각 섹션에 설명된 개발 과정을 통해 앱의 주요 기능과 사용법을 익히실 수 있습니다. 링크는 블로그 포스트 하단에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\nQ2: AI 프롬프트 제안 기능은 어떤 식으로 작동하나요?\nA2: 이 기능은 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 텍스트로 추가하는 요청사항을 분석하여, 기존 프롬프트를 더욱 개선하거나 사용자 의도에 맞는 새로운 프롬프트를 생성해줍니다. 이를 통해 더 정교하고 독창적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\nQ3: 앱이 무료로 제공되는데, 기능 제한은 없나요?\nA3: 네, 현재 공개된 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 모든 기능을 제한 없이 무료로 제공됩니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분이 부담 없이 AI 이미지 생성의 즐거움을 만끽하시길 바랍니다.\n{\"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\": [{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 어떻게 사용할 수 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"@type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"앱은 웹 기반으로 제공되며, 별도의 설치 없이 인터넷 브라우저를 통해 접속할 수 있습니다. 각 섹션에 설명된 개발 과정을 통해 앱의 주요 기능과 사용법을 익히실 수 있습니다. 링크는 블로그 포스트 하단에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.\"}},{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"AI 프롬프트 제안 기능은 어떤 식으로 작동하나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"@type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"이 기능은 사용자가 업로드하는 이미지와 텍스트로 추가하는 요청사항을 분석하여, 기존 프롬프트를 더욱 개선하거나 사용자 의도에 맞는 새로운 프롬프트를 생성해줍니다. 이를 통해 더 정교하고 독창적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\"}},{\"@type\": \"Question\",\"name\": \"앱이 무료로 제공되는데, 기능 제한은 없나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\": {\"type\": \"Answer\",\"text\": \"네, 현재 공개된 나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 앱은 모든 기능을 제한 없이 무료로 제공됩니다. 이 앱을 통해 여러분이 부담 없이 AI 이미지 생성의 즐거움을 만끽하시길 바랍니다.\"}}]} \n마무리하며: 새로운 창작의 문을 열다!\n이렇게 해서 많은 분들의 기대를 모았던 '나노바나나 168종 프롬프트 모음 앱'이 드디어 완성되었습니다! 이 앱은 단순히 프롬프트를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, AI Studio 앱빌더를 활용하여 개발 과정에서 겪었던 시행착오와 해결 과정까지 담은, 저에게는 참 의미 있는 결과물이에요.\nAI 이미지 생성과 편집이 이렇게 쉽고 강력해질 수 있다는 사실에 저 스스로도 다시 한번 놀라곤 합니다. 여러분의 소중한 시간과 노력을 아껴주고, 동시에 창작의 영감을 불어넣어 줄 이 앱을 지금 바로 무료로 경험해보세요!\n앱 링크는 아래에서 확인하실 수 있습니다. 많은 관심과 활용 부탁드리며, 여러분의 멋진 AI 작품들을 기대하겠습니다!\n나노바나나 프롬프트 쇼케이스 바로가기\nhttps://ai.studio/apps/drive/1aRW7y-kpscwD7QKyVQfP8Mf6vyuNjtSm\n\n \n로그인 - Google 계정\n이메일 또는 휴대전화\naccounts.google.com",

있다.\n다만, 지금의 우리는 교육으로 글로벌 시장을 노리는 것으로 에너지를 집중하고 있다.\n3개 꼭지점을 모두 다 달성한 플랫폼은 국내/국외 어디에도 없다.\n아마도 가장 근접한 건 링크드인이다.\n커뮤니티와 채용에 있어서는 세계 최고가 되었고, 린다닷컴을 인수해서 교육쪽으로도 계속해서 시도하고 있으니 말이다.\n국내에서는 확실하게 이 영역을 모두 확보한 플랫폼이 없다.\n하지만 많은 커리어 플랫폼이 이 영역들을 확보하기 위해 도전하고 있다.\n그러다보니 퍼블리를 비롯해 비슷한 결의 서비스들은 어떻게 시도하는지 자주 지켜봤다.\n마침 퍼블리에는 좋아하는 콘텐츠들도 많았어서 구독제 멤버십도 가입해서 자주 사용했다.\n\n\n퍼블리를 자주 이용하던 중,\n개발자들을 위한 SNS 서비스 '커리어리'를 시작한다는 소식을 들었다.\n'위하이어' 라는 ATS 서비스를 시작하신다는 것도 들었다.\n그리고 어느 순간 퍼블리에 읽고 싶은 콘텐츠가 더이상 추가되지 않았다.\n내 취향의 콘텐츠가 없다보니 얼마되지 않는 그 구독료도 아까웠다.\n그래서 훨씬 더 내 취향인 폴인의 구독을 시작했고, 지금까지도 연간 구독으로 계속해서 콘텐츠를 보고 있다.\n2023년엔 대표인 쭈와 함께 박소령 대표님, 이승국 CPO님과 함께 저녁식사를 먹으면서 스타트업에 대한 이야기를 나누기도 했다.\n커리어리와 위하이어로 개발자와 채용에 관해서 집중하신다는 것도 알게 됐다.\n그래서 어떤 과정으로 퍼블리와 그 외 서비스들이 시작했는지, 비중은 어떻게 되는지, 시리즈 B 투자로 받은 135억을 어떻게 활용하셨는지 등등 많이 궁금했었다.\n한국 콘텐츠 스타트업에서 퍼블리가 남긴 족적은 분명히 크다.\n그래서 퍼블리가 어떻게 10년을 보내왔는지 그 기록이 너무나 중요하다고 생각했는데, 이번에 이렇게 책으로 정리해주셔서 정말 감사했다.\n금, 토 이틀만에 다 읽으면서 지금 스타트업 시리즈 A, B 단계의 회사에서는 이 노트가 얼마나 귀한 기록인지 감사한 마음뿐이다.\nVC와의 관계와 투자는 어떻게 진행해야하는지,\n투자 받은 자금을 어떻게 활용해야하는지,\n레이오프는 어떻게 해야 덜 후회하고 앞으로를 위해 도움이 되는지 등등.\n아직 유니콘이 되지 못한 스타트업에 다니시는 분들이라면 무조건 적으로 읽어보시라고 추천하고 싶다.\n책 제목이 \"실패를 통과하는 일\"이다.\n인프런은 꼭 통과하지 않기로 몇번이고 다짐했다.\n책 속 문장\n매월 달성해야하는 재무 목표는 곧 매주, 매일의 목표로도 환산되기에 업무 우선순위에 대한 감각이 더 예민해지면서 긴장감을 가질 수 있었음.\n팀과 커뮤니케이션을 할 때도 단순히 \"BEP를 달성하자\"가 아니라 \"2023년 4월에 ㅇㅇ곳의 신규고객사가 ㅇㅇ원을 결제해서 매출이 00원 발생하면 BEP를 덜상할 수 있으니 집중하자\" 라고 말하면, 해야 할 일이 명료해져서 좋았음.\n사업에서 돈을 벌려면 '남이 하기 싫은 일을 대신 해주고, 그 대가로 돈을 받는다'라는 고전적인 명제가 진리임을 다시 한번 절감함.\n부와 행복은 두 가지 요소로 이뤄진 등식임을 항상 기억하자.\n두 가지란 당신이 '가진 것(현실)'과 '기대하는 것(기대치)'이다.\n이 둘은 똑같이 중요하다.\n따라서 가진 것을 늘리는 데에는 엄청난 노력을 쏟으면서 기대치를 관리하는 데에는 거의 신경을 쓰지 않는 것은 말이 안된다.\n특히 우리가 훨씬 더 쉽게 통제할 수 있는 것은 현실이 아닌 기대치이므로 더욱 그렇다.\n...\n정말로 원하는 것은 기대한 것과 실제 결과의 차이를 경험하는 일이다.\n우리는 기대한 것보다 더 좋은 결과를 얻었을 때 만족과 성취감을 느낀다.\n커리어 소셜미디어를 먼저 만들고 나중에 비즈니스 모델을 붙이는 것, 채용관리 소프트웨어를 먼저 만들고 나중에 신규고객에게 세일즈하는 것은 모두 돈 버는 것을 뒤로 미룬 결정이었다.\n최저 가치 단계에서 어떻게 돈을 벌어야하는지, 이렇게 돈 버는 방법이 나와 잘 맞는지, 앞으로도 지치지 않고 꾸준히 할 수 있는 일인지 미리 파악하고 고칠 수 있는 기회를 날려버리고 말았던 것이다.\n나는 모든 일은 시작보다 끝이 중요하다고 생각하며, 사람과의 관계도 마찬가지라고 생각함.\n시작에는 설렘과 충동성, 도파민이 있음.\n반면 끝은 책임감, 희생정신, 전우애가 필요함.\n'어떤 일의 끝에 다다랐을 때 어떻게 행동하는가' 는 그 사람이 고통을 대하는 태도를 보여주는 좋은 리트머스 테스트다.\n가장 끝의 순간에 하는 행동은 그 사람에 대해 정말 많은 것을 보여준다.\n...\n그래서 함께 일할 사람을 채용할 때 반드시 체크해야 할 것은 '전 직장을 퇴사할 때 어떻게 행동했는가'이다.\n자신이 사지 않을 것은 팔지 않는다.\n존경하지 않고 존중하지 않는 사람 밑에서 일하지 않는다.\n같이 있으면 즐거운 사람들하고만 일한다.\n정기구독 사업은 7일 무료체험을 시작하면서 고객 수가 빠르게 증가했고, 12개월 장기상품 판매로 매출도 올라가기 시작했음.\n그 와중에 연말 프로모션 준비까지 더해지며 팀 전체가 매우 바쁘고 정신없었음.\n하지만 밤늦게까지 야근을 해도 사무실엔 항상 활력이 돌았음.\n사업 지표가 올라가고 매출이 상승하면 누가 시키지 않아도 신나서 일한다는 것을 알게 됨.\n...\n마지막으로 2019년 4월에 만들기 시작한 '커리어리'가 있었음.\n이 서비스는 2년이 되도록 지지부진한 상태였음.\n이런 상황에서는 팀 내 갈등 역시 두드러지기 마련이라는 것도, 아무리 HR 차원에서 해결책을 강구해도 사업 성과가 해결되지 않는 한 백약이 무효라는 것도 배웠음.\n평시 CEO의 특성은 소위 '좋은 사람이자 좋은 리더'의 전형적 모습이다.\n반대로 전시 CEO의 특성은 가까이하고 싶지 않은 인물 유형이고, 특히 한국 사회의 기준에서는 비판받기 쉬운 점들도 다수 포함되어 있다.\n그렇기에 전시 CEO로 일하려면 어릴때부터 학습된 '좋은 사회인'에서 벗어날 뻔뻔함이 필요한데, 나는 그러지 못했다.\n...\n전시 CEO는 어디까지나 긴급 상황에서 일시적으로 유효하다고 생각했고, 내가 읽었던 많은 책에 나오는 것처럼 평시 CEO 모드로 일하는 것이 더 우월한 방향이라고 믿었다.\n하지만 지금 돌아보면, 나는 그저 전시 CEO로서 '미움받을 용기'가 없었던 것이다.\n<하드씽> 에서 벤 호로위츠는 대부분의 경영서들이 평화로운 시기의 성공적인 기업들을 연구한 컨설턴트가 썼다는 점을 기억해야 한다고 주장한다.\n평시 CEO가 사용하는 방법들에 대해 알려주는 책이 아니라, 전시 CEO가 탁월하게 경영하는 법을 알려주는 책을 읽어야 한다는 것이다.\n문제는 그런 책이 거의 없다는 것이라며, 나처럼 책으로 학습하는 것을 좋아하는 독자에게 날카롭게 경고한다.\n이나모리 가즈오는 전시 상황을 겪은 기업들을 살려낸 생생한 경험이 있었기에, <왜 리더인가> 에서 이렇게 적는다.\n\"나는 느슨하고 헐거운 마음가짐으로 문제의 뒤로 물러나 좋은 사람인 척하는 리더보다 가끔은 미치광이 소리를 듣더라도 무소처럼 일의 정면으로 달려들어 일을 완벽하게 장악하는 리더를 훨씬 신뢰한다.\n우리는 일 앞에서 좀 더 난폭해져도 된다.\n아니, 리더라면 반드시 그래야만 한다\"\n레이 달리오가 쓴 책 <원칙>을 읽었음.\n\"사람을 계획에 맞춰라.\n당신에게 필요한 사람들의 유형은 조직의 설계에 달려 있기 때문에, 조직을 구성할 때는 계획이 사람보다 선행한다.\n조직을 설계하면서 일을 잘하기 위해 개인들에게 요구되는 특성에 대한 명확한 심상지도를 만들어라.\n...\n사람에 맞추기 위해 업무를 계획해서는 안 된다.\n이것은 시간이 흐르면 대부분 실패로 드러난다.\n이런 일은 해고하는 것을 꺼리는 사람이 그 사람이 할 수 있는 다른 일을 찾아보려는 경향이 있을 때 흔히 발생한다\"\n\"내가 지금까지 만난 대표 중에 늦게 레이오프해서 후회한 대표는 있어도, 빨리 레이오프해서 후회한 대표는 한 명도 없었다.\n대표가 '뭔가 잘못되었는제'라고 느끼고 있다면 그때가 결정해야 할 타이밍이다.\n대표가 가진 직감을 믿어라.\"\n필요한 일을 할 수 있는 사람이 지금 팀에서 누구인지 매칭하는 작업도 진행함.\n변화에 빠르고 유연하게 적응할 수 있는 능력,\n계속 학습하며 성장하는 마인드셋을 보인 사람과 그렇지 않은 사람에 대해서도 의견을 듣고 여러 차례 논의를 거침.\n7월 1일 19명이었던 팀이 8월 20일 무렵 11명으로 줄어 있었음.\n레이오프는 한 명이었지만, 연쇄작용으로 7명이 자진 퇴사했기 때문임.\n레이오프를 거치면서, 채용에 대한 생가에 변화가 생김\n첫 번째, 유능한 제너럴리스트를 뽑자.\n비가와도 망하는 게 스타트업이라고, 한 치 앞을 알 수 없는 상황에서는 사업이 언제 어떻게 바뀔지 모름.\n시장 상황에 맞게 계속 변화하고 또 변화해야만 생존할 수 있음.\n스페셜리스트에게 맞지 않는 일을 주는 것은 개인에게도 조직에도 불행임.\n따라서 사업모델에 여전히 불확실성이 높은 상태에서는 유능한 스페셜리스트가 아니라 유능한 제너럴리스트를 뽑아야 함.\n내가 생각한 스타트업의 가장 큰 특징은 '생존의 불확실성'이었음\n실력과 태도 둘 다 좋은 사람만 채용한다는 것은 현실적으로 매우 어려운 일이었고, 또 다른 어려운 점은 실력과 태도라는 개념이 참으로 추상적이라는 사실이었음.\n...\n여기서 말하는 태도는 조직에서 선호하는 속성이 기준임.\n...\n나의 경우, 시간이 갈수록 점점 더 중요하게 본 세 가지 속성이 겸손함, 성실함, 책임감이었음.\n반대로 말하자면 겸손하지 않은 사람, 성실하지 않은 사람, 책임감이 없는 사람은 '곱하기'에서 0에 해당한다고 생각했음.\n첫 번째 대규모 레이오프를 계획하면서 두 가지 선택지를 놓고 고민했음.\n동일한 액수의 현금을 절감한다면,\na. 많은 인원을 레이오프하고, 기존 인력들의 보상을 유지한다.\nb. 적은 인원을 레이오프하는 대신, 기존 인력들의 현금 보상을 절감한다.\n나는 두 번째를 선택함.\n커리어리가 이제 막 개발자라는 주요한 타깃 고객을 찾아낸 상황이었고, 이들이 사랑할 수 있는 제품을 만들려면 빠르게 많은 실험을 해야 하므로 제품 조직은 꼭 필요하다는 생각 떄문이었음.\n...\n당시 팀 규모는 60명 후반에서 70명 초반 정도였고, 레이오프 대상자는 10% 이내였음.\n각자 받는 총보상액에 따라 현금 보상의 삭감 수준이 달랐는데 5~20% 범위였고, 나는 40%를 삭감함\n...\n놀랍게도 현금 보상을 줄이자는 제안에 모두가 동의했음.\n...\n하지만 내가 잘못 판단한 것이 있었음.\n타운홀을 기점으로 레이오프에 대한 커뮤니케이션을 종료하고 그 다음 목표를 향해 빠르게 달리자고 치열함을 독려하기보다는, 어수선하고 상처받았을 팀원들을 감정적으로 케어하는 데 조직의 에너지를 쓰게 만든 것임.\n회사의 공식적인 리소스가 게속 포스트 레이오프에 쓰이게 됨.\n미래로 나아가는 것이 아니라 과거의 상처를 핥는 데 팀의 중요한 시간을 쓰게 한 것, 즉 레이오프 이후 냉정하지 못했떤 나 자신에 대한 반성이 있음.\n2023년 11월에 진행된 대규모 레이오프의 목적은 첫 번째 대규모 레이오프에서 얻은 크나큰 깨달음에서 비롯되었음.\n현금 보상 삭감이라는 선택이 얼마나 인간의 본성에 어긋나는 결정이었는가에 대한 아하 모멘트가 뒤늦게 찾아왔기 때문임.\n...\n어렵게 채용한 팀원들을 최대한 데리고 가야 원하는 성과를 낼 수 있다는 이유 때문이었음.\n...\n약 반년이 지나 깨달은 것은 '내가 회사를 위해 보상을 희생했다' 라는 인식으로 여러 부작용이 발생했다는 것임.\n개인으로서는 자연스러운 감정이라고 생각함.\n나 자신도 되돌아보니, 급여에 대한 희생을 요구했다는 미안함 때문에 팀과 정확한 커뮤니케이션을 해야 할 때도 심리적 장벽으로 인해 그러지 못했음.\n레이오프를 많이 했다고 후회하는 대표는 본 적이 없다.\n할 수 있는 한 최대한 해라.\n60~70%까지 해도 된다.\n이렇게 해도 의외로 회사는 잘 돌아간다.\n처음 레이오프를 적게 했다가 두 번 레이오프하는 게 최악이다.\n<파워풀> 에는 수십 명 규모의 작은 스타트업이었던 넷플릭스가 전 세계에 서비스를 제공하는 글로벌 기업으로 확장하던 시기에 겪은 내부 진통의 경험이 나온다.\n패티 맥코드에게 초기 멤버였던 팀원이 회사가 변했다며 불만을 토로하자, 당신은 50명 규모의 스타트업 조직에서 가장 행복해할 사람이라며 이제는 회사와 개인의 교집합이 종료되었다는 사실을 알려준다.\n또한 커리어 상담을 하러 찾아온 직원에게는 자신이 좋아하고 잘하는 일을 계속 같은 회사에서 할 필요는 없다고 조언한다.\n이사진이나 주요 주주를 눈치 봐야 할 상사로 생각하지 말고, 문제를 상담할 수 있는 멘토로 여겨라.\n기업가치 극대화라는 관점에서 이들은 그 어떤 이들보다 우군이다.\n2024년 <이나모리 가즈오의 회계경영> 이라는 책을 선물 받았다.\n...\n'60년간 수많은 기업을 이끌며 내가 단 한 번도 적자를 기록한 적이 없는 비결은 매출은 최대로, 경비는 최소로 라는 아주 단순한 원칙을 목숨처럼 지켰기 때문이다.\n...\n함부로 사람 늘리지마라. 원자재는 딱 필요한 만큼만 사라.\n...\n이익이 없다면 당신의 사업은 사업이 아니다.\n이익이 없으면 그것은 회사가 아니다.\n제프 베이조스는 의사결정 전에 '이 결정은 번복 가능한가, 아닌가'를 먼저 따져봐야 한다고 말했다.\n대부분은 번복 가능한 의사결정에 속하므로 원하는 결과가 아니라면 결정을 빠르게 되돌리면 그만이다.\n하지만 주주에 관한 결정 (누구를 주주로 초대하고, 그가 몇 퍼센트의 지분을 갖는가)은 번복하기 어려운 데다 번복하려면 큰 비용을 치러야 한다.\n회사 매각 과정을 거치면서 내가 절실하게 깨달았던 것은, 창업자와 주주 사이에 중요한 어젠다 중 하나가 회사의 최종 목표와 주주의 엑시트 플랜에 대한 대화라는 점이다.\nVC 주주는 우리 회사에 투자한 펀드의 만기일이 있다보니 오랜 시간 기다려줄 수도 없거니와, 애초에 오랜 기간이 필요한 사업이었다면 VC 투자가 적합하지도 않다.\n'우리의 목표는 매각인가, IPO인가? 매각이라면 언제 얼마의 가치로 어떤 곳을 잠재 인수자로 고려하여 진행해야 하는가? IPO라면 언제 얼마의 가치로 어디에 상장할 것인가?\n다음 라운드는 언제, 얼마로 펀드레이징을 할 것인가?\n펀드 만기와 수익률을 고려할 때 납득할 만한 계획인가?'\n회사의 최종 목표와 주주의 엑시트 플랜에 대한 고민은 '중요하지만 급하지는 않은 일'에 해당했고, 이런 카테고리의 일이야말로 시간을 따로 빼노혹 챙겨야 한다는 것을 머리로는 알았지만 몸이 따라가지 못했다.\n'중요하지만 급하지는 않은 일'이 어느새 '중요하고 급한 일'이 되는 순간부터 혼돈이 시작되는 것은 당연지사였다.\n<허브 코헨의 협상의 기술 1> 의 내용이 뒤늦게 떠올랐음.\n...\n이 책에서 그는 협상에서 승리하는 열쇠는 항상 상대방이 시간, 돈, 에너지를 먼저 투자하게 만드는 것이라고 강조함.\n어떤 형태로든 투자한 게 있어야 자신이 쏟아부은 노력을 돌려받고자 하는 심리가 발동한다는 이유 때문이었음.\n2024년 9월, 드라마 <쇼군>이 미국 에미상 시상식에서 18관왕을 휩쓸었다는 기사를 읽은 후 뒤늦게 몰아보았다.\n...\n그리고 <쇼군>이 내게 준 가장 큰 교훈은 '약자의 협상법'이었다.\n...\n드라마 후반, 죽음이 코앞에 닥친 상황에서 도쿠가와는 오사카 세력을 상대로 협상하면서 한 가지를 반드시 지킨다.\n바로 '시간의 주도권'만큼은 본인이 절대 놓지 않는 것.\n그는 협상 자리에서 매번 \"X라는 상황이 오면, 나는 언제까지 Y를 하겠다\"라는 식으로 말한다.\n상황 자체는 본인 힘으로 온전히 통제할 수 없지만, 그 상황에 따른 자신의 행동만큼은 먼저 타임라인을 설정하고 상대에게 통보한다.\n이렇게 하면 상대도 그가 제시한 타임라인을 기준으로 생각하게 된다.\n내가 만약 다시 투자받을 일이 있다면, 그때는 투자한 회사 중 잘 안된 곳 대표를 소개해달라고 할 것 같다.\n그 대표와 이야기를 하면 이 VC가 어떤 곳인지 가장 잘 알 수 있을 것 같다.\n왜 이렇게 돈 관리가 느슨했는지 돌이켜보면, '스타트업은 속도가 생명이니, 돈으로 시간을 살 수 있다면 돈을 쓰는게 맞다' 라는 분위기에 나도 별생각 없이 편승했기 때문이라고 생각한다.\n문제는 이 명제가 언제나 그리고 모든 사업에 통용되는 건 아니라는 사실이다.\n우리 사업은 '지금 돈과 시간 중 무엇에 더 높은 가치를 둘 것인가'에 대해 건강검진하듯 꾸준히 체크했어야 했는데, 그러지 못했다.\n<월마트, 두려움 없는 도전>을 읽고 나서, 제포 베이조스는 분명 샘 월턴으로부터 영향을 받았을 것이라고 생각했다.\n...\n'경쟁에서 이기는 것보다 비용 관리에 더 집중하라.\n이를 잘하면 반드시 경쟁우위를 선점할 수 있다.\n우리는 매출액 대비 비용이 가장 낮다는 점에서 업계 내 1위를 차지했다.\n사업을 하다 보면 몇 차례 실수하기 마련이다.\n그대로 전반적인 운영 효율이 높으면 실수를 해도 큰 타격을 입을 우려는 없다'\n'내가 약간은 손해 보는 것이 좋다' 라는 생각으로 임하자.\n...\n내가 약간은 손해 본다는 생각으로 타협해야만 상대방은 5대5라고 느낀다고 했다.\n반대로 내가 5대5라고 생각하고 타협하면 상대는 오히려 손해 봤다고 생각할 거라고.",

Kubernetes에서 컨테이너를 실행할 때는 Pod를 사용하는데요. Pod를 사용할 때 컨테이너의 리소스를 얼마나 할당할 것인가는 클러스터의 안정성과 연결되어 있기 때문에 중요한 문제 중 하나입니다. Pod의 컴퓨팅 리소스는 보통 다음과 같이 **requests**와 **limit**으로 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: v1\r\r\nkind: Pod\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: frontend\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  containers:\r\r\n  - name: app\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n  - name: log-aggregator\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n리소스를 설정할 때 우리는 보통 메모리를 중심으로 정하는데요, 컨테이너의 메모리 사용량이 한계값에 도달하면 Pod는 재실행됩니다.\r\r\n그렇다면, CPU 사용량의 경우에는 어떨까요? 자주 사용되진 않지만 한 번쯤 알아두면 좋은 CPU 사용량 제한에 대해 알아보았습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## Kubernetes CPU Resource 설정\r\r\n먼저 Pod의 Resource 항목에서 설정 가능한 CPU의 Request와 Limit, 그리고 단위에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU Requests\r\r\nCPU requests는 컨테이너가 정상적으로 실행하기 위한 최소한의 CPU 양을 의미합니다. requests는 kube-scheduler가 Pod를 노드에 할당하는 스케줄링 작업에서 사용합니다. kube-scheduler는 Pod의 requests 값을 합산하여 할당 가능한 노드를 찾아서 Pod를 배치합니다. 노드에 Pod의 requests를 수용할 만한 여유가 있어야 할당이 되는 것이죠. 이 조건을 만족하는 노드가 없다면 Pod는 pending 상태로 스케줄링되지 않습니다.\r\r\nPod가 특정 노드에 스케줄링되었다면 요청된 CPU의 양은 보장됩니다. 이 말은 requests의 양만큼 CPU를 항상 점유한다는 뜻은 아닙니다. CPU 사용에 경합이 발생했을 때도 요청한 만큼의 CPU 시간을 할당 받는 것을 보장합니다. requests의 값이 없다면 Pod가 비효율적으로 배치될 수 있고 필요 이상의 클러스터 자원을 사용하여 불필요한 비용 지출이 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU Limits\r\r\nCPU limits는 컨테이너가 사용할 수 있는 CPU의 절대적인 최댓값을 의미하며 kubelet이 관리합니다. Pod의 컨테이너가 limits를 초과하여 CPU를 사용하려 할 때 해당 컨테이너의 CPU 사용을 인위적으로 낮추는 스로틀링(Throttling)을 통해 상한선을 강제합니다. limits는 여러 서비스가 동시에 실행되고 있는 Kubernetes 클러스터에서 하나의 컨테이너가 CPU를 과점하여 다른 컨테이너의 성능에 영향을 주거나 노드의 안정성을 해치는 CPU 기아 상태를 방지하는 데 의미가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. CPU Unit\r\r\nKubernetes에서 CPU의 단위는 절대적인 양으로 사용되며 1 Kubernetes CPU는 1vCPU 또는 물리적인 1 CPU 코어의 컴퓨팅 파워와 동일한 것으로 간주합니다.\r\r\nKubernetes에서는 코어를 밀리코어(millicore)로 더 작게 나누어 설정할 수 있습니다. 1000m은 1 CPU와 동일하며 0.5 CPU는 500m과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 4. QoS(quality of service, 서비스 품질) 클래스\r\r\nKubernetes는 설정한 requests와 limits에 따라서 자동으로 QoS 클래스를 할당합니다.\r\r\n• **Guaranteed (보장)**: Pod 내의 모든 컨테이너가 CPU와 메모리에 대해 requests와 limits를 모두 설정하고, 그 값이 서로 동일할 때(requests.cpu == limits.cpu) 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 높은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드에 리소스 압박이 발생했을 때 가장 마지막에 축출(eviction)됩니다.\r\r\n• **Burstable (버스트 가능)**: Pod 내에 최소 하나 이상의 컨테이너가 CPU 또는 메모리 requests를 설정했지만, Guaranteed 클래스의 조건을 충족하지 못할 때 할당됩니다(예: requests.cpu < limits.cpu). 이 Pod들은 노드에 여유 리소스가 있을 경우, 요청한 양보다 더 많은 리소스를 \"버스트(burst)\"하여 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n• **BestEffort (최선 노력)**: Pod 내의 어떤 컨테이너도 CPU나 메모리에 대한 requests나 limits를 설정하지 않았을 때 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 낮은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드 리소스가 부족해지면 가장 먼저 축출 대상이 됩니다. \r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 리눅스 커널의 CPU 관리 메커니즘\r\r\nKubernetes에서 설정한 requests와 limits를 리눅스 커널이 어떻게 실제로 CPU를 할당하고 제한하는지 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 여기에는 컨테이너 기술을 탄생시킨 cgroup(Control Group)과 CFS(Completely Fair Scheduler)가 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. 리눅스 컨트롤 그룹(cgroup)\r\r\ncgroup은 프로세스들의 집합에 대해 CPU, 메모리, I/O와 같은 시스템 리소스의 사용량을 제한하고, 추적하며, 격리합니다. cgroup은 /sys/fs/cgroup/이라는 가상 파일 시스템 내에 계층적 구조로 구성됩니다. Kubernetes는 이 구조 내에 kubepods.slice라는 전용 경로를 만들어 Pod들의 리소스를 관리합니다.\r\r\nCPU 리소스 관리를 담당하는 cgroup의 특정 모듈을 ‘컨트롤러’ 또는 ‘서브시스템’이라 부르며, Kubernetes가 CPU requests와 limits를 구현하기 위해 사용하는 것이 바로 CPU 서브시스템입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. Completely Fair Scheduler(CFS)\r\r\nCFS는 리눅스 커널의 기본 프로세스 스케줄러로, 그 이름처럼 ‘완전한 공정성’을 목표로 합니다. CFS는 마치 ‘이상적인 멀티태스킹 CPU’가 존재하는 것처럼, 실행 가능한 모든 태스크(프로세스)가 정확히 동일한 비율의 CPU 시간을 할당 받도록 노력합니다.\r\r\n실제 하드웨어는 한 번에 하나의 작업만 실행할 수 있기 때문에, CFS는 ‘가상 런타임(virtual runtime, vruntime)’이라는 개념을 사용합니다. CFS는 항상 가장 작은 vruntime 값을 가진 작업, 즉 지금까지 가장 적게 실행된 작업을 선택하여 실행함으로써 장기적인 관점에서 공정성을 보장합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. Kubernetes와 커널의 매핑\r\r\nkubelet은 Kubernetes의 yaml 명세를 실제 커널에 적용하기 위해서 변환 작업을 수행합니다. kubelet은 resources 설정을 읽어 해당 컨테이너의 cgroup 디렉터리 내 특정 파일에 값을 덮어쓰는 방식으로 커널에 지시를 내립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.1. Requests와 cpu.shares: 상대적 가중치 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.requests.cpu 값은 cgroup의 cpu.shares 파일 값으로 변환됩니다. 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.shares=requests.cpu (millicores)×1024/1000.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, 1000m(1 코어) 요청은 1024 shares로, 500m 요청은 512 shares로 변환됩니다. 가장 중요한 점은 cpu.shares가 **노드에 CPU 경합이 있을 때만 의미를 가지는 상대적 가중치**라는 것입니다. 만약 CPU 자원을 두고 경쟁하는 두 컨테이너가 있고, 하나는 2048 shares, 다른 하나는 1024 shares를 가지고 있다면, 전자는 후자보다 두 배의 CPU 시간을 할당 받게 됩니다. 하지만 노드가 유휴 상태이고 CPU 경합이 없다면, 컨테이너는 자신의 shares 값과 무관하게 필요한 만큼의 CPU를 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.2. Limits와 cpu.cfs_period_us & cpu.cfs_quota_us: 절대적 시간 할당량 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.limits.cpu 값은 CFS 대역폭 제어라는 메커니즘을 통해 강제됩니다. 이 메커니즘은 두 가지 파라미터에 의해서 결정됩니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_period_us: 할당량을 정산하는 주기로 단위는 마이크로초입니다. Kubernetes는 기본값인 100000(즉 100ms)을 사용합니다. 이 한 window 내에서 할당량이 정해집니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_quota_us: 위에서 정의된 period 동안 cgroup이 소비할 수 있는 총 CPU 시간을 정의합니다. 단위는 마이크로초입니다. 이 값은 resources.limitscpu로부터 계산됩니다. limits가 없을 경우 -1로 할당량 없음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n변환 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.cfs_quota_us=limits.cpu (cores)×cpu.cfs_period_us.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, limits.cpu를 500m(0.5 코어)로 설정하면, cpu.cfs_quota_us=0.5×100000=50000이 됩니다. 이는 해당 컨테이너가 매 100ms 주기마다 최대 50,000 마이크로초(50ms)의 CPU 시간만 사용할 수 있음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 요약\r\r\n| Kubernetes 설정 | Kubernetes에서의 목적 | 리눅스 cgroup 파일 | 동작 |\r\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\r\n| resources.requests.cpu | 스케줄링 및 경합 시 최소 CPU 보장 | cpu.shares | 상대적 가중치; CPU 경합 시에만 활성화 |\r\r\n| resources.lmits.cpu | 런타임 시 최대 CPU사용량 제한 | cpu.cfs_quota_us | 절대적 시간 할당량; 항상 활성화, 스로틀링 발생 |\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## Limits 적용으로 발생할 수 있는 현상\r\r\nCPU limits를 설정했을 때 발생하는 가장 중요하고 종종 오해 받는 현상이 바로 CPU 스로틀링입니다. 스로틀링은 단순히 성능을 약간 늦추는 것이 아니라, 애플리케이션의 지연 시간에 심각하고 예측 불가능한 영향을 미칠 수 있는 ‘정지-대기(stop-wait)’ 프로세스입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU 스로틀링과 발생 원인\r\r\nCPU 스로틀링은 컨테이너 내의 프로세스들이 현재의 cfs_period_us(보통 100ms) 동안 할당된 cfs_quota_us를 모두 소진했을 때 발생합니다. 할당량을 모두 사용한 컨테이너의 프로세스들은 커널 스케줄러에 의해 실행이 '정지'됩니다. 그리고 다음 100ms 주기가 시작되어 할당량이 다시 채워질 때까지 대기해야 합니다.\r\r\n이 현상은 특히 멀티 스레드 애플리케이션에서 증폭되어 나타납니다. 예를 들어, 한 컨테이너가 1 코어(cfs_quota_us=100000)의 limit을 가지고 있지만, 4개의 바쁜 스레드를 동시에 실행한다고 가정해 봅시다.\r\r\n이 컨테이너는 4개의 코어를 동시에 사용하여 단 25ms의 실제 시간만에 100ms의 CPU 시간 할당량을 모두 소진할 수 있습니다. 그 후, 해당 컨테이너는 남은 75ms 동안 노드에 유휴 코어가 있더라도 완전히 스로틀링되어 아무 작업도 수행할 수 없게 됩니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit1.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit2.png)\r\r\n스로틀링은 애플리케이션 요청 처리 시간에 직접적으로 지연을 추가합니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 작업을 완료하는 데 순수하게 300ms의 CPU 시간이 필요한 애플리케이션이 100ms 주기당 50ms의 limit에 의해 제한된다고 가정해 봅시다. 이 작업은 다른 시스템 부하가 전혀 없더라도 최소 6개의 주기, 즉 600ms의 실제 시간이 걸려야 완료될 수 있습니다. 이러한 지연은 타임아웃, 연쇄적인 장애, 그리고 궁극적으로는 나쁜 사용자 경험으로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n스로틀링은 전통적인 CPU 사용률 지표로는 확인하기가 힘든 경우가 있습니다. 어떤 컨테이너가 CPU 사용률 50%(자신의 limit 값)를 보이고 있더라도, 실제로는 심각하게 스로틀링되어 매우 느린 상태일 수 있습니다. 이 경우 CPU는 전통적인 의미에서 '최대치로 사용'되는 것이 아니라, 인위적으로 억제되고 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. '시끄러운 이웃' 오해\r\r\nlimits가 ‘시끄러운 이웃(noisy neighbor)’ 문제, 즉 하나의 애플리케이션이 리소스를 독점하여 다른 애플리케이션에 영향을 주는 것을 막아 줄 수 있을 것처럼 보입니다. 하지만 실제로는 requests에 의해 결정되는 cpu.shares가 경합 상황에서도 적절하게 리소스를 배분할 수 있는 시스템이라고 할 수 있습니다. 만약 모든 Pod에 적절한 requests가 설정되어 있다면, CFS 스케줄러는 shares 값에 비례하여 CPU 시간을 분배함으로써 특정 Pod가 다른 Pod들이 기아 상태에 빠지는 것을 방지합니다. 반면 limits는 다른 누구도 CPU를 필요로 하지 않는 상황에서조차 Pod의 사용량을 제한하는 무딘 도구에 가깝습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 스로틀링 테스트\r\r\n테스트를 위해 한 웹 애플리케이션을 만들었습니다. 이 애플리케이션에 1 CPU를 할당하면 작업을 완료하는 데 대략 12초 정도 걸립니다.\r\r\n이 애플리케이션에 각각 1 CPU, 0.1 CPU를 할당하여 CPU 사용량과 작업 시간을 확인하여 지금까지 확인한 현상이 발생하는지 테스트해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 테스트용 Pod 준비\r\r\n아래와 같이 CPU limit만 다르게 설정하여 Pod를 생성하였습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8081\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n---\r\r\n# 1 코어 제한 버전\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8080\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 응답 시간 비교\r\r\n0.1 CPU를 할당한 애플리케이션에서는 122초가 소요된 반면 1 CPU가 할당된 애플리케이션에서는 11.51초만 소요된 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 그라파나를 통한 스로틀링 현상 확인\r\r\n* <span style=\"background-color:#DCFFE4\">초록색: 1 CPU</span>\r\r\n* <span style=\"background-color:#fff5b1\">노란색: 0.1 CPU</span>\r\r\n\r\r\nCPU 사용률에서 노란색 그래프가 CPU limits가 0.1로 설정되어 그 이상 사용하지 못하는 모습을 보여줍니다. CPU 할당 횟수에서 노란색이 Limits에 걸려서 더 많은 cpu 할당이 발생한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이것은 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가 시뮬레이션과 일치하는 결과입니다. 당연하게도 스로틀링 비율도 노란색이 더 높은 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit4.png)\r\r\n중요한 지표는 스로틀링 비율로서 비율이 5%를 지속적으로 넘는 현상이 발생한다면 스로틀링이 빈번하게 발생하여 성능에 제약을 받아 서비스가 느려져 있을 가능성이 있으므로 조치를 취해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 스로틀링 비율 지표 예시\r\r\n```\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n/\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n```\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 나가며\r\r\n결론은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n* 일반적인 경우,\r\r\n\t* request만 설정하여 자원이 더 필요할 때는 노드의 가용 자원을 사용하고 자원이 모자랄 때는 비율로 할당 받도록 하는 것이 좋은 것 같습니다. (QoS는 Burstable로 설정됨)\r\r\n\t* QoS가 Burstable로 설정되지만 CPU는 Eviction의 조건이 아니기 때문에 throttling이 발생할지언정 pod가 eviction 되지는 않습니다.\r\r\n* limit만 설정하는 경우는 피해야 합니다. limit만 설정할 경우 request가 0이 되어 자원 가용량이 없는 노드에도 스케줄링 될 수 있으며 런타임 시 예측이 어려워집니다.\r\r\n* CPU request는 Pod가 노드에 할당될 때는 절댓값으로 사용되고 할당된 뒤에는 상대적인 비율로 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### 참고 문헌\r\r\n• Kubernetes, Resource Management for Pods and Containers, https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/\r\r\n• KubeBlog, Understanding CPU Requests and Limits, 2023. 10. 5., https://www.kubeblog.com/basics/understanding-cpu-requests-and-limits/\r\r\n• Itiel Shwartz, Kubernetes CPU Limits: What’s the Right Way to Assign CPU Resources?, 2025. 1. 14., https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-cpu-limits-throttling/\r\r\n• Eliran Cohen, For the love of god, learn when to use CPU limits on Kubernetes., 2023. 3. 5., https://medium.com/@eliran89c/for-the-love-of-god-learn-when-to-use-cpu-limits-on-kubernetes-2225341e9dbd\r\r\n• Max Levin, Kubernetes CPU Throttling: What it is, and Best Practices, 2024. 6. 6., https://www.groundcover.com/blog/kubernetes-cpu-throttling\r\r\n• CODE FARM, Linux CGroups and Containers, 2024. 2. 3., https://blog.codefarm.me/2021/11/23/linux-cgroups-containers/\r\r\n• Andreas Karis Blog, Quick guide for cgroups, 2020. 9. 3., https://andreaskaris.github.io/blog/linux/cgroups/\r\r\n• Martin, Cgroups - Deep Dive into Resource Management in Kubernetes, 2023. 2. 20., https://martinheinz.dev/blog/91\r\r\n• Jianhao, Kubernetes CPU requests and limits, 2021. 11. 11., https://jaanhio.me/blog/kubernetes-cpu-requests-limits/\r\r\n• Red Hat, Resource Management Guide > CPU, https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-cpu\r\r\n• Real-time Ubuntu, Linux kernel schedulers, https://documentation.ubuntu.com/real-time/latest/explanation/schedulers/\r\r\n• Rifewang, Kubernetes: CPU Configuration, Linux CFS, and Performance Issues with Programming Languages, 2024. 12. 11., https://medium.com/@rifewang/kubernetes-cpu-configuration-linux-cfs-and-performance-issues-with-programming-languages-ccef783ed22e\r\r\n• JettyCloud, Making Sense of Kubernetes CPU Requests And Limits, 2023. 3. 20., https://medium.com/@jettycloud/making-sense-of-kubernetes-cpu-requests-and-limits-390bbb5b7c92\r\r\n• Tania Duggal, PerfectScale, Kubernetes CPU Limit: Best Practices for Optimal Performance, 2024. 10. 24., https://www.perfectscale.io/blog/kubernetes-cpu-limit-best-practises\r\r\n• Shane Corbett, AWS Blogs, Using Prometheus to Avoid Disasters with Kubernetes CPU Limits, 2022. 9. 21., https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-prometheus-to-avoid-disasters-with-kubernetes-cpu-limits/\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_blue_202509.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooterblue202509.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

Pod의 컴퓨팅 리소스는 보통 다음과 같이 **requests**와 **limit**으로 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: v1\r\r\nkind: Pod\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: frontend\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  containers:\r\r\n  - name: app\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/app:v4\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n  - name: log-aggregator\r\r\n    image: images.my-company.example/log-aggregator:v6\r\r\n    resources:\r\r\n      requests:\r\r\n        memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"250m\"\r\r\n      limits:\r\r\n        memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n        cpu: \"500m\"\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n리소스를 설정할 때 우리는 보통 메모리를 중심으로 정하는데요, 컨테이너의 메모리 사용량이 한계값에 도달하면 Pod는 재실행됩니다.\r\r\n그렇다면, CPU 사용량의 경우에는 어떨까요? 자주 사용되진 않지만 한 번쯤 알아두면 좋은 CPU 사용량 제한에 대해 알아보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Kubernetes CPU Resource 설정\r\r\n먼저 Pod의 Resource 항목에서 설정 가능한 CPU의 Request와 Limit, 그리고 단위에 대해 알아보도록 하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU Requests\r\r\nCPU requests는 컨테이너가 정상적으로 실행하기 위한 최소한의 CPU 양을 의미합니다. requests는 kube-scheduler가 Pod를 노드에 할당하는 스케줄링 작업에서 사용합니다. kube-scheduler는 Pod의 requests 값을 합산하여 할당 가능한 노드를 찾아서 Pod를 배치합니다. 노드에 Pod의 requests를 수용할 만한 여유가 있어야 할당이 되는 것이죠. 이 조건을 만족하는 노드가 없다면 Pod는 pending 상태로 스케줄링되지 않습니다.\r\r\nPod가 특정 노드에 스케줄링되었다면 요청된 CPU의 양은 보장됩니다. 이 말은 requests의 양만큼 CPU를 항상 점유한다는 뜻은 아닙니다. CPU 사용에 경합이 발생했을 때도 요청한 만큼의 CPU 시간을 할당 받는 것을 보장합니다. requests의 값이 없다면 Pod가 비효율적으로 배치될 수 있고 필요 이상의 클러스터 자원을 사용하여 불필요한 비용 지출이 발생할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU Limits\r\r\nCPU limits는 컨테이너가 사용할 수 있는 CPU의 절대적인 최댓값을 의미하며 kubelet이 관리합니다. Pod의 컨테이너가 limits를 초과하여 CPU를 사용하려 할 때 해당 컨테이너의 CPU 사용을 인위적으로 낮추는 스로틀링(Throttling)을 통해 상한선을 강제합니다. limits는 여러 서비스가 동시에 실행되고 있는 Kubernetes 클러스터에서 하나의 컨테이너가 CPU를 과점하여 다른 컨테이너의 성능에 영향을 주거나 노드의 안정성을 해치는 CPU 기아 상태를 방지하는 데 의미가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. CPU Unit\r\r\nKubernetes에서 CPU의 단위는 절대적인 양으로 사용되며 1 Kubernetes CPU는 1vCPU 또는 물리적인 1 CPU 코어의 컴퓨팅 파워와 동일한 것으로 간주합니다.\r\r\nKubernetes에서는 코어를 밀리코어(millicore)로 더 작게 나누어 설정할 수 있습니다. 1000m은 1 CPU와 동일하며 0.5 CPU는 500m과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 4. QoS(quality of service, 서비스 품질) 클래스\r\r\nKubernetes는 설정한 requests와 limits에 따라서 자동으로 QoS 클래스를 할당합니다.\r\r\n• **Guaranteed (보장)**: Pod 내의 모든 컨테이너가 CPU와 메모리에 대해 requests와 limits를 모두 설정하고, 그 값이 서로 동일할 때(requests.cpu == limits.cpu) 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 높은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드에 리소스 압박이 발생했을 때 가장 마지막에 축출(eviction)됩니다.\r\r\n• **Burstable (버스트 가능)**: Pod 내에 최소 하나 이상의 컨테이너가 CPU 또는 메모리 requests를 설정했지만, Guaranteed 클래스의 조건을 충족하지 못할 때 할당됩니다(예: requests.cpu < limits.cpu). 이 Pod들은 노드에 여유 리소스가 있을 경우, 요청한 양보다 더 많은 리소스를 \"버스트(burst)\"하여 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n• **BestEffort (최선 노력)**: Pod 내의 어떤 컨테이너도 CPU나 메모리에 대한 requests나 limits를 설정하지 않았을 때 할당됩니다. 이 Pod들은 가장 낮은 우선순위를 가지며, 노드 리소스가 부족해지면 가장 먼저 축출 대상이 됩니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n## 리눅스 커널의 CPU 관리 메커니즘\r\r\nKubernetes에서 설정한 requests와 limits를 리눅스 커널이 어떻게 실제로 CPU를 할당하고 제한하는지 알아보도록 하겠습니다. 여기에는 컨테이너 기술을 탄생시킨 cgroup(Control Group)과 CFS(Completely Fair Scheduler)가 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. 리눅스 컨트롤 그룹(cgroup)\r\r\ncgroup은 프로세스들의 집합에 대해 CPU, 메모리, I/O와 같은 시스템 리소스의 사용량을 제한하고, 추적하며, 격리합니다. cgroup은 /sys/fs/cgroup/이라는 가상 파일 시스템 내에 계층적 구조로 구성됩니다. Kubernetes는 이 구조 내에 kubepods.slice라는 전용 경로를 만들어 Pod들의 리소스를 관리합니다.\r\r\nCPU 리소스 관리를 담당하는 cgroup의 특정 모듈을 ‘컨트롤러’ 또는 ‘서브시스템’이라 부르며, Kubernetes가 CPU requests와 limits를 구현하기 위해 사용하는 것이 바로 CPU 서브시스템입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. Completely Fair Scheduler(CFS)\r\r\nCFS는 리눅스 커널의 기본 프로세스 스케줄러로, 그 이름처럼 ‘완전한 공정성’을 목표로 합니다. CFS는 마치 ‘이상적인 멀티태스킹 CPU’가 존재하는 것처럼, 실행 가능한 모든 태스크(프로세스)가 정확히 동일한 비율의 CPU 시간을 할당 받도록 노력합니다.\r\r\n실제 하드웨어는 한 번에 하나의 작업만 실행할 수 있기 때문에, CFS는 ‘가상 런타임(virtual runtime, vruntime)’이라는 개념을 사용합니다. CFS는 항상 가장 작은 vruntime 값을 가진 작업, 즉 지금까지 가장 적게 실행된 작업을 선택하여 실행함으로써 장기적인 관점에서 공정성을 보장합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. Kubernetes와 커널의 매핑\r\r\nkubelet은 Kubernetes의 yaml 명세를 실제 커널에 적용하기 위해서 변환 작업을 수행합니다. kubelet은 resources 설정을 읽어 해당 컨테이너의 cgroup 디렉터리 내 특정 파일에 값을 덮어쓰는 방식으로 커널에 지시를 내립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.1. Requests와 cpu.shares: 상대적 가중치 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.requests.cpu 값은 cgroup의 cpu.shares 파일 값으로 변환됩니다. 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.shares=requests.cpu (millicores)×1024/1000.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, 1000m(1 코어) 요청은 1024 shares로, 500m 요청은 512 shares로 변환됩니다. 가장 중요한 점은 cpu.shares가 **노드에 CPU 경합이 있을 때만 의미를 가지는 상대적 가중치**라는 것입니다. 만약 CPU 자원을 두고 경쟁하는 두 컨테이너가 있고, 하나는 2048 shares, 다른 하나는 1024 shares를 가지고 있다면, 전자는 후자보다 두 배의 CPU 시간을 할당 받게 됩니다. 하지만 노드가 유휴 상태이고 CPU 경합이 없다면, 컨테이너는 자신의 shares 값과 무관하게 필요한 만큼의 CPU를 사용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### **3.2. Limits와 cpu.cfs_period_us & cpu.cfs_quota_us: 절대적 시간 할당량 시스템**\r\r\nPod의 resources.limits.cpu 값은 CFS 대역폭 제어라는 메커니즘을 통해 강제됩니다. 이 메커니즘은 두 가지 파라미터에 의해서 결정됩니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_period_us: 할당량을 정산하는 주기로 단위는 마이크로초입니다. Kubernetes는 기본값인 100000(즉 100ms)을 사용합니다. 이 한 window 내에서 할당량이 정해집니다.\r\r\n• cpu.cfs_quota_us: 위에서 정의된 period 동안 cgroup이 소비할 수 있는 총 CPU 시간을 정의합니다. 단위는 마이크로초입니다. 이 값은 resources.limitscpu로부터 계산됩니다. limits가 없을 경우 -1로 할당량 없음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n변환 공식은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\ncpu.cfs_quota_us=limits.cpu (cores)×cpu.cfs_period_us.\r\r\n```\r\r\n예를 들어, limits.cpu를 500m(0.5 코어)로 설정하면, cpu.cfs_quota_us=0.5×100000=50000이 됩니다. 이는 해당 컨테이너가 매 100ms 주기마다 최대 50,000 마이크로초(50ms)의 CPU 시간만 사용할 수 있음을 의미합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 요약\r\r\n| Kubernetes 설정 | Kubernetes에서의 목적 | 리눅스 cgroup 파일 | 동작 |\r\r\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\r\r\n| resources.requests.cpu | 스케줄링 및 경합 시 최소 CPU 보장 | cpu.shares | 상대적 가중치; CPU 경합 시에만 활성화 |\r\r\n| resources.lmits.cpu | 런타임 시 최대 CPU사용량 제한 | cpu.cfs_quota_us | 절대적 시간 할당량; 항상 활성화, 스로틀링 발생 |\r\r\n\r\r\n## Limits 적용으로 발생할 수 있는 현상\r\r\nCPU limits를 설정했을 때 발생하는 가장 중요하고 종종 오해 받는 현상이 바로 CPU 스로틀링입니다. 스로틀링은 단순히 성능을 약간 늦추는 것이 아니라, 애플리케이션의 지연 시간에 심각하고 예측 불가능한 영향을 미칠 수 있는 ‘정지-대기(stop-wait)’ 프로세스입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 1. CPU 스로틀링과 발생 원인\r\r\nCPU 스로틀링은 컨테이너 내의 프로세스들이 현재의 cfs_period_us(보통 100ms) 동안 할당된 cfs_quota_us를 모두 소진했을 때 발생합니다. 할당량을 모두 사용한 컨테이너의 프로세스들은 커널 스케줄러에 의해 실행이 '정지'됩니다. 그리고 다음 100ms 주기가 시작되어 할당량이 다시 채워질 때까지 대기해야 합니다.\r\r\n이 현상은 특히 멀티 스레드 애플리케이션에서 증폭되어 나타납니다. 예를 들어, 한 컨테이너가 1 코어(cfs_quota_us=100000)의 limit을 가지고 있지만, 4개의 바쁜 스레드를 동시에 실행한다고 가정해 봅시다.\r\r\n이 컨테이너는 4개의 코어를 동시에 사용하여 단 25ms의 실제 시간만에 100ms의 CPU 시간 할당량을 모두 소진할 수 있습니다. 그 후, 해당 컨테이너는 남은 75ms 동안 노드에 유휴 코어가 있더라도 완전히 스로틀링되어 아무 작업도 수행할 수 없게 됩니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit1.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 2. CPU 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit2.png)\r\r\n스로틀링은 애플리케이션 요청 처리 시간에 직접적으로 지연을 추가합니다. 예를 들어, 어떤 작업을 완료하는 데 순수하게 300ms의 CPU 시간이 필요한 애플리케이션이 100ms 주기당 50ms의 limit에 의해 제한된다고 가정해 봅시다. 이 작업은 다른 시스템 부하가 전혀 없더라도 최소 6개의 주기, 즉 600ms의 실제 시간이 걸려야 완료될 수 있습니다. 이러한 지연은 타임아웃, 연쇄적인 장애, 그리고 궁극적으로는 나쁜 사용자 경험으로 이어질 수 있습니다.\r\r\n스로틀링은 전통적인 CPU 사용률 지표로는 확인하기가 힘든 경우가 있습니다. 어떤 컨테이너가 CPU 사용률 50%(자신의 limit 값)를 보이고 있더라도, 실제로는 심각하게 스로틀링되어 매우 느린 상태일 수 있습니다. 이 경우 CPU는 전통적인 의미에서 '최대치로 사용'되는 것이 아니라, 인위적으로 억제되고 있는 상태입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 3. '시끄러운 이웃' 오해\r\r\nlimits가 ‘시끄러운 이웃(noisy neighbor)’ 문제, 즉 하나의 애플리케이션이 리소스를 독점하여 다른 애플리케이션에 영향을 주는 것을 막아 줄 수 있을 것처럼 보입니다. 하지만 실제로는 requests에 의해 결정되는 cpu.shares가 경합 상황에서도 적절하게 리소스를 배분할 수 있는 시스템이라고 할 수 있습니다. 만약 모든 Pod에 적절한 requests가 설정되어 있다면, CFS 스케줄러는 shares 값에 비례하여 CPU 시간을 분배함으로써 특정 Pod가 다른 Pod들이 기아 상태에 빠지는 것을 방지합니다. 반면 limits는 다른 누구도 CPU를 필요로 하지 않는 상황에서조차 Pod의 사용량을 제한하는 무딘 도구에 가깝습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 스로틀링 테스트\r\r\n테스트를 위해 한 웹 애플리케이션을 만들었습니다. 이 애플리케이션에 1 CPU를 할당하면 작업을 완료하는 데 대략 12초 정도 걸립니다.\r\r\n이 애플리케이션에 각각 1 CPU, 0.1 CPU를 할당하여 CPU 사용량과 작업 시간을 확인하여 지금까지 확인한 현상이 발생하는지 테스트해 보았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 테스트용 Pod 준비\r\r\n아래와 같이 CPU limit만 다르게 설정하여 Pod를 생성하였습니다.\r\r\n```\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8081\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"100m\"    # 0.1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n---\r\r\n# 1 코어 제한 버전\r\r\napiVersion: apps/v1\r\r\nkind: Deployment\r\r\nmetadata:\r\r\n  name: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  labels:\r\r\n    app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\nspec:\r\r\n  replicas: 1\r\r\n  selector:\r\r\n    matchLabels:\r\r\n      app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n  template:\r\r\n    metadata:\r\r\n      labels:\r\r\n        app: cpu-test-app-1core\r\r\n    spec:\r\r\n      containers:\r\r\n      - name: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        image: cpu-test-app\r\r\n        ports:\r\r\n        - containerPort: 8080\r\r\n        resources:\r\r\n          requests:\r\r\n            memory: \"64Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어\r\r\n          limits:\r\r\n            memory: \"128Mi\"\r\r\n            cpu: \"1000m\"   # 1 코어로 제한\r\r\n        livenessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 10\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 30\r\r\n        readinessProbe:\r\r\n          httpGet:\r\r\n            path: /health\r\r\n            port: 8080\r\r\n          initialDelaySeconds: 5\r\r\n          periodSeconds: 10\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 응답 시간 비교\r\r\n0.1 CPU를 할당한 애플리케이션에서는 122초가 소요된 반면 1 CPU가 할당된 애플리케이션에서는 11.51초만 소요된 것을 확인할 수 있었습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 그라파나를 통한 스로틀링 현상 확인\r\r\n* 초록색: 1 CPU\r\r\n* 노란색: 0.1 CPU\r\r\n\r\r\nCPU 사용률에서 노란색 그래프가 CPU limits가 0.1로 설정되어 그 이상 사용하지 못하는 모습을 보여줍니다. CPU 할당 횟수에서 노란색이 Limits에 걸려서 더 많은 cpu 할당이 발생한 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이것은 스로틀링으로 인한 지연 시간 증가 시뮬레이션과 일치하는 결과입니다. 당연하게도 스로틀링 비율도 노란색이 더 높은 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n![K8s_CPU limit_4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/K8sCPU%20limit4.png)\r\r\n중요한 지표는 스로틀링 비율로서 비율이 5%를 지속적으로 넘는 현상이 발생한다면 스로틀링이 빈번하게 발생하여 성능에 제약을 받아 서비스가 느려져 있을 가능성이 있으므로 조치를 취해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 스로틀링 비율 지표 예시\r\r\n```\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n/\r\r\nsum by (namespace, pod) (rate(container_cpu_cfs_periods_total{container!=\"\"}[5m]))\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n## 나가며\r\r\n결론은 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n* 일반적인 경우,\r\r\n\t* request만 설정하여 자원이 더 필요할 때는 노드의 가용 자원을 사용하고 자원이 모자랄 때는 비율로 할당 받도록 하는 것이 좋은 것 같습니다. (QoS는 Burstable로 설정됨)\r\r\n\t* QoS가 Burstable로 설정되지만 CPU는 Eviction의 조건이 아니기 때문에 throttling이 발생할지언정 pod가 eviction 되지는 않습니다.\r\r\n* limit만 설정하는 경우는 피해야 합니다. limit만 설정할 경우 request가 0이 되어 자원 가용량이 없는 노드에도 스케줄링 될 수 있으며 런타임 시 예측이 어려워집니다.\r\r\n* CPU request는 Pod가 노드에 할당될 때는 절댓값으로 사용되고 할당된 뒤에는 상대적인 비율로 사용됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n### 참고 문헌\r\r\n• Kubernetes, Resource Management for Pods and Containers, https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/\r\r\n• KubeBlog, Understanding CPU Requests and Limits, 2023. 10. 5., https://www.kubeblog.com/basics/understanding-cpu-requests-and-limits/\r\r\n• Itiel Shwartz, Kubernetes CPU Limits: What’s the Right Way to Assign CPU Resources?, 2025. 1. 14., https://komodor.com/learn/kubernetes-cpu-limits-throttling/\r\r\n• Eliran Cohen, For the love of god, learn when to use CPU limits on Kubernetes., 2023. 3. 5., https://medium.com/@eliran89c/for-the-love-of-god-learn-when-to-use-cpu-limits-on-kubernetes-2225341e9dbd\r\r\n• Max Levin, Kubernetes CPU Throttling: What it is, and Best Practices, 2024. 6. 6., https://www.groundcover.com/blog/kubernetes-cpu-throttling\r\r\n• CODE FARM, Linux CGroups and Containers, 2024. 2. 3., https://blog.codefarm.me/2021/11/23/linux-cgroups-containers/\r\r\n• Andreas Karis Blog, Quick guide for cgroups, 2020. 9. 3., https://andreaskaris.github.io/blog/linux/cgroups/\r\r\n• Martin, Cgroups - Deep Dive into Resource Management in Kubernetes, 2023. 2. 20., https://martinheinz.dev/blog/91\r\r\n• Jianhao, Kubernetes CPU requests and limits, 2021. 11. 11., https://jaanhio.me/blog/kubernetes-cpu-requests-limits/\r\r\n• Red Hat, Resource Management Guide > CPU, https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/6/html/resource_management_guide/sec-cpu\r\r\n• Real-time Ubuntu, Linux kernel schedulers, https://documentation.ubuntu.com/real-time/latest/explanation/schedulers/\r\r\n• Rifewang, Kubernetes: CPU Configuration, Linux CFS, and Performance Issues with Programming Languages, 2024. 12. 11., https://medium.com/@rifewang/kubernetes-cpu-configuration-linux-cfs-and-performance-issues-with-programming-languages-ccef783ed22e\r\r\n• JettyCloud, Making Sense of Kubernetes CPU Requests And Limits, 2023. 3. 20., https://medium.com/@jettycloud/making-sense-of-kubernetes-cpu-requests-and-limits-390bbb5b7c92\r\r\n• Tania Duggal, PerfectScale, Kubernetes CPU Limit: Best Practices for Optimal Performance, 2024. 10. 24., https://www.perfectscale.io/blog/kubernetes-cpu-limit-best-practises\r\r\n• Shane Corbett, AWS Blogs, Using Prometheus to Avoid Disasters with Kubernetes CPU Limits, 2022. 9. 21., https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/using-prometheus-to-avoid-disasters-with-kubernetes-cpu-limits/\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_blue_202509.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooterblue202509.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "관련해서 내가 여러 번 포스팅했고, 우리 투자사 대표님들을 포함, 나를 만나본 분들은 나한테 자주 듣는 말인데, 하고 싶은 것과 할 수 있는 것 관련 내용이다. 작든 크든, 회사를 운영할 때 대표이사는 스스로에게 매우 냉정하게 물어보고 확인해야 할 것들이 여러 가지가 있는데, 그중 하나가 바로 본인과 팀이 할 수 있는 것과 하고 싶은 것을 스스로에게 물어보고, 구분해야 하는 중요한 작업이다.\n여기서 말하는 ‘할 수 있는 것’은 바로 회사의 스킬과 능력이다. 예를 들어, 팀이 그동안 해왔던 게 개발이라면, 이 팀이 잘하는 건 개발이다. ‘하고 싶은 것’은 말 그대로 회사의 능력과는 상관없이 이 팀이 하고 싶은 일이다. 즉, 욕심이다. 잘하는 건 개발일 수도 있지만, 대표이사가 오래전부터 개인적으로 관심을 두고 열심히 취미 생활을 했던 건 케이팝 공연 기획일 수도 있다. 이 회사는 개발을 해야할까 케이팝 공연을 기획해야 할까?\n이렇게 회사가 잘할 수 있는 것과 하고 싶은 것이 다르면, 사업의 첫 단추부터 잘 못 끼워질 확률이 높다. 이 경우에 너무 많은 창업가가 본인과 팀이 정말 잘할 수 있는 일은 무시하고 과소평가하고, 하고 싶은 것에만 초점을 맞춰서 회사의 모든 자원을 여기에 집중한다. 최악의 경우엔, 한 번도 해보지 않았지만, 너무나 하고 싶은 일에 계속 무모한 도전을 하면서 시간과 돈만 낭비하는 걸 너무 많이 봤다.\n이 구조에 따라서 사업을 멀리서 바라보면 – 너무 가까이서 보면 내가 지금 잘하는 걸 하는지, 아니면 내가 그냥 하고 싶은 걸 하는지, 이게 잘 안 보일 때가 있다 – 내가 잘하는 것과 내가 하고 싶은 것이라는 두 원이 일치하는 완벽한 교집합에서 사업을 하면 성공의 확률이 매우 높다는 결론을 내릴 수 있다. 이론적으론 이게 맞지만, 이 완벽한 교집합에서 사업하는 사람들은 거의 없어서 나는 대부분의 창업가들에게 이 두 원이 조금이라도 겹치는 접점에서 아이디어를 생각해 내고, 이 아이디어를 기반으로 창업하면 그나마 조금이라도 성공의 확률을 높일 수 있다고 한다.\n내가 잘하는 것과 하고 싶은 것의 교집합은 지금 당장 내가 상대적으로 쉽게 시작할 수 있는 일일 테고, 그 교집합의 면적이 작아서 일단 작게 시작해 보면, 작지만, 눈에 띄는 결과를 만들 수 있을 것이다. 내가 하고 싶은 일이고, 내가 잘하는 일이기 때문에. 그리고 작지만, 그 작은 목표 또한 상대적으로 쉽게 달성할 수 있다. 이 과정을 통해서 어느 정도의 성과와 자신감이 생기면, 이를 기반으로 실력을 더 강화한 후 이 두 원의 교집합의 면적을 더 크게 만들 수 있을 것이다.\n내 결론은 무조건 내가 잘하는 것으로부터 시작해야 한다. 내가 잘하는 것을 파악하고, 이게 모든 결정의 시작이 돼야 한다. 내가 잘하는 것을 기반으로, 이게 내가 하고 싶은 것인지를 판단해 보고, 아니라면 하지 말거나, 내가 하고 싶은 것을 조금이라도 내가 잘하는 것과 일치시킬 수 있는 방법에 대해 고민해 봐야 한다.\n그리고 마지막으로, 내가 잘하는 것과 내가 하고 싶은 것을 기반으로, 이게 내가 지금 해야 하는 것인지를 – 즉, 시장이 존재하는지 – 냉정하게 판단해야 한다. 항상 강조하지만, 이 세 가지가 완벽하게 일치하는 경우는 거의 없지만, 완벽하게 일치하는 분야에서 창업한다면, 그만큼 성공 확률이 높다. 하지만, 세 가지 중 두 가지만 어느 정도 일치해도 도전해 볼 가치는 충분히 있다고 나는 생각한다. 두 가지가 어느 정도 일치되면, 나머지 하나의 원과 교집합이 만들어질 수 있게 다양한 시도를 해볼 수 있고, 운 좋으면 이 과정에서 완벽하진 않지만, 접점을 만들 수도 있기 때문이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "“한국은 시장이 작다.”\n이 말은 내가 13년 넘게 한국에 투자하면서 셀 수 없을 정도로 너무나 많이 듣던 말이다. 우리 같은 VC에게 자금을 제공하는 한국과 외국 투자자들이 입에 달고 다닐 정도로 너무 많이 하는 지적이고, 심지어 창업가들도 한국 시장이 너무 작기 때문에 항상 해외 시장을 타겟 하거나 아예 본사를 해외로 옮기는 걸 고민하는 경우를 너무 자주 본다. 시장이 작다는 건 다양한 방식으로 해석할 수 있지만, 한국 시장이 작다고 말하는 분들은 대부분 한국의 5,000만 명 인구를 의미한다. 5,000만 인구로 만들 수 있는 GDP와 같은 출력은 한정되어 있기 때문에 한국 시장은 완전히 의미 없을 정도로 작진 않지만, 아무리 커져도 확실히 한계가 있다는 의미이다.\n내가 전에 이 글에서 이제 한국 창업가들이 드디어 글로벌 시장으로 나갈 능력, 배짱, 그리고 자신감이 생겼기 때문에 이제 우리의 TAM(Total Addressable Market)은 한국의 5,000만 명으로 국한되는 게 아니라 일본이나 동남아 시장도 우리의 시장이라고 볼 수 있다고 했다. 이렇게 보면 한국이라는 나라는 인구 5,000만 명의 나라지만, 한국 창업가들의 시장은 이보다 훨씬 더 크다고 할 수 있다.\n물론, 이 외에도 경제 전문가들이 말하는 한국 시장 크기의 한계를 극복하는 두 가지 방법은 북한과의 통일, 그리고 더 많은 외국인을 수입하는 것이다. 현실적으로 북한과의 통일은 단기간 내에 이룩하기 어렵고, 솔직히 요새 많은 분과 이야기해 보면 통일을 오히려 원치 않는다는 느낌을 받기도 한다. 더 많은 외국인을 – 그리고 여기서 말하는 외국인은 외국인 노동자보단, 지식근로자를 의미한다 – 한국으로 수입하기 위해서는 한국의 외국인 비자 정책을 더 쉽고 간단하게 만들어야 한다. 한국의 외국인 비자 프로그램은 생각보다 더 복잡하고 까다로워서 외국인들이 한국에 와서 일하고 사는 게 은근히 어렵다. 그리고 아직도 일부는 한국 젊은이들도 취업을 못 하는데, 외국인들이 한국에 와서 그나마 없는 일자리를 다 “뺐어” 가는 것에 대해서 상당한 불만을 표시하는 분들도 있어서 이 또한 단시간 내에 해결하기 어려운 문제 같다.\n내가 요새 생각하는 한국의 경제 규모와 시장 크기를 확장하는 다른 한 가지 방법은 조금 뜬금없지만, 우리의 가깝고도 먼 이웃 일본과 경제공동체를 만드는 것이다. 그리고 조금 더 나아가선 한국-일본-대만, 이렇게 세 나라가 EU와 같은 경제공동체 AU(Asian Union)를 만드는 것이다. 세 나라는 공통점이 많다. 모두 다 아시아 문화권이고, 모두 다 잘 사는 나라들이고, 모두 다 인구밀도도 비슷해서 이 바닥에서 말하는 ARPU가 높게 나올 수 있다. 그리고 모두 다 서로를 좋아하고 교류가 많다. 이런 말을 전에 공개적으로 했는데, 어떤 분들은 일본과 우리가 경제공동체를 만들어야 한다는 아이디어에 매우 민감하게 반응했다. 대부분 나이가 든 노인들이었는데, 나는 이분들에게 얼마나 많은 한국 젊은이가 일본을 좋아하고, 얼마나 많은 일본 젊은이가 한국을 좋아하는지 강조했다. 솔직히 잘 먹히진 않았지만, 어차피 노인들은 곧 죽을 것이고, 양국의 정치 또한 젊은이들이 할 것이라서 나는 이 아이디어가 그렇게 가능성이 없다고 생각하지 않는다.\n솔직히 대만은 중국이 있어서 좀 어렵긴 할 것 같지만, 이미 월드 클래스인 세 나라가 공동체를 만들 수 있다면, 시장 크기, 인구 크기, 경제 크기, 이 모든 면에서 정말 거대하고 대단한 규모의 시장을 만들 수 있을 것이다.",

A product should never require users to “know” or “learn” how to use it. The simpler the product, the more people use it, and the faster and bigger the service grows.\nBehind every Toss service is rigorous thinking, relentless experimentation, and bold challenges. Along this journey, we have discovered the following 10 principles for creating products that truly succeed.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n01. Casual Concept\nAre complex ideas presented in a way that feels familiar and easy to understand? Here at Toss, we replace technical jargon with everyday language that anyone can grasp instantly.\n02. Simple Policy\nAn intuitive product starts with a simple policy. No matter how polished the UI, if the rules are complicated, the product will feel complicated.\n03. Value First\nIt’s our job to show users that our product is worth their time and money. By clearly communicating its benefits before asking them to act, we guide users seamlessly to complete the task at hand.\n04. Clear Action\nIs the required action to achieve the desired result obvious at a glance? Without reading a word, users should know exactly what to do next.\n05. Context Based\nWas the entire user journey considered in the design? Every product flow should feel natural from beginning to end. A fragmented or forced experience will only push users away.\n06. Easy to Answer\nCan users answer every question within three seconds? If users find something hard to decide, we provide recommendations. When they can’t recall something, we retrieve the information for them. Three simple questions are always better than one difficult one, but none is the best.\n07. Explain Why\nDid users receive a clear explanation of why they needed to complete the action? Never assume what’s obvious to us is obvious to users. Always explain the reason behind an action so they can move forward with confidence.\n08. One Thing\nEach page should deliver a single, clear core message, refined to its essentials.\n09. No More Loading\nHave we completely removed waiting for users? Long wait time drifts users away. Pull all levers to eliminate delays —whether by redesigning flows, improving policies, or adopting new technology.\n10. Minimum Features\nMore features in a product mean more complexity, slower updates, and more bugs. Adding a new feature often brings more cost than value, and should be a last resort.\nFollow us on .css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}LinkedIn and explore more detailed updates about Toss.",

이러한 집중 견제는 어떤 결과로 이어질까요?\n이번 글에서는 미국이 중국을 견제하는 이유가 무엇인지, 미·중 갈등이 지속될 경우 투자자는 어떻게 대응해야 하는지를 차근차근 말씀드릴게요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n미국 vs 중국, 4가지 경쟁 구도\n출장에서 만난 현지 전문가들에 따르면, 미국은 관세뿐 아니라 여러 방면에서 중국을 견제하고 있었습니다. 그 말인즉슨, 중국의 부상을 억제하려면 그만큼 복합적인 전략이 필요하다는 의미입니다.\na) 체제 경쟁\n후버 연구소의 조셉 토리지안은 시진핑 주석이 부친의 숙청 경험과 문화대혁명을 반면교사 삼아 ‘중국식 현대화 모델’을 채택했다고 말합니다. 공산당 이념에 디지털 통제를 융합한 이 모델이 장기 집권을 정당화하는 데 쓰이고 있다는 거죠.\n미국이 경계하는 건 이러한 체제가 중국 외 다른 나라로 확산되는 것입니다. 실제로 중국은 우간다, 짐바브웨 같은 아프리카 기업에 AI 기반 감시 카메라나 안면인식 군중분석 시스템 등 감시 인프라를 수출했어요. 이를 두고 허드슨 연구소의 토마스 벤슨은 중국이 전 세계로 확산될 ‘기술 기반 전체주의 모델’을 선도하고 있다고 우려했습니다.\nb) 금융 자본 경쟁\n미국은 중국으로 금융자본이 유입되는 상황에 대해서도 강한 경계심을 갖고 있었습니다. 토마스 벤슨은 특히 미국과 유럽의 자본이 홍콩 증시를 통해 제재 대상인 중국 기업으로 흘러갈 수 있음을 지적했어요.\n예를 들어, 미국은 인권 문제를 이유로 신장 위구르 지역에서 생산된 제품의 수입을 금지하고 있습니다. 하지만 이들 기업도 금융시장을 통하면 미국으로부터 자금을 조달할 수 있죠. 당연히 제재 효과는 약해질 수밖에 없습니다.\nc) 기술 패권 경쟁\nAI, 반도체, 위성 등 첨단 기술은 국가 경쟁력의 핵심으로 여겨져요. 미국이 중국의 기술 발전을 경계하는 이유도 여기에 있습니다. 실제로 미국은 AI 산업의 핵심인 GPU 가 중국으로 수출되는 것에 제한을 두고 있죠.\n우려가 현실로 드러난 사례도 있었습니다. 올해 초 중국 딥시크(Deepseek)가 등장하면서 미국 주식시장에서 엔비디아 등 관련 기업의 주가가 크게 하락한 것입니다. 이후 주가는 회복되었지만, 중국의 기술 발전이 미국의 AI 및 반도체 산업에 타격을 줄 수 있다는 걸 보여준 사건이었어요.\nd) 공급망 확보 경쟁\n코로나19 당시 미국은 면봉이나 시약 같은 기본적인 의료 물품조차 중국에 의존해야 했어요. 쓰라린 경험을 통해 미국은 공급망 확보의 중요성을 새삼 깨달았죠. 이후 미국은 헬스케어 산업뿐 아니라 반도체, 에너지, 클라우드 등 핵심 산업 전반에 걸쳐 공급망 국내화를 추진하고 있습니다.\n바이든 정부가 인플레이션 감축법(IRA)*, 칩스법(Chips Act)** 등 미국 내 에너지/반도체 생산 기업에 보조금을 지급한 것도 공급망 국내화 전략의 일환이었습니다. 칩스법에는 ‘미국에서 보조금을 받는 기업은 중국 내 첨단 반도체 투자를 금지한다’는 조항이 포함되어 있죠. 인플레이션 감축법 또한 ‘중국에서 생산된 소재 및 부품을 사용할 경우 보조금 대상에서 제외한다’는 조건을 담고 있고요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 미국 내에서 생산된 전기차·배터리 등 친환경 산업에 보조금을 주는 법\n** 미국 내 반도체 공장 투자와 생산에 보조금과 세제 혜택을 지원하는 법\n과거 미국이 견제했던 다른 나라들\n미국은 과거에도 특정 국가를 견제한 적이 있습니다. 바로 소련과 일본이에요.\n\na) 소련 - 냉전시대의 경쟁자\n1950년대, 공산주의 진영을 대표하던 소련은 산업화에 성공하며 세계 2위 경제대국으로 올라섰어요. 군사력도 막강했죠. 미국 입장에서는 위기감이 들 수밖에 없었습니다. 그때 미국 외교관 조지 캐넌이 대통령에게 편지 한 통을 보냅니다.\n.css-2sk6rv{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);white-space:pre-wrap;margin:24px 0;padding-left:20px;position:relative;}.css-2sk6rv::before{content:'';display:block;position:absolute;top:4px;left:0;width:2px;height:calc(100% - 4px * 2);padding:4px 0;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n소련은 공산주의 확산을 꿈꾸고 있습니다. 정치, 경제, 외교로 봉쇄해야 해요..css-7mseny>*{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.css-7mseny>:last-child{margin-bottom:0;}blockquote>.css-7mseny:first-child>:first-child{margin-top:0;}\n이 편지를 계기로 소련 봉쇄 전략이 구체화됐어요.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n마셜 플랜: 유럽 경제 재건 지원으로 소련의 영향력 차단\n나토(NATO): 서유럽 국가들을 군사 동맹으로 묶어 소련 견제\n\n쉽게 말해 미국이 소련을 왕따시킨 셈이었죠. 당시 미·소 갈등은 자유주의와 공산주의의 ‘진영 싸움’이었기에 가능했어요. 결국 막대한 군비 지출에 허덕이던 소련은 붕괴했습니다.\nb) 일본 - 한때 반도체 생산량 1위\n1980년대에는 일본이 미국을 긴장하게 했습니다. 일본의 반도체, 자동차, 전자제품이 세계 시장을 휩쓸면서 미국의 핵심 산업을 위협했거든요. 당시 미국 무역적자의 40%가 일본 때문일 정도였어요.\n미국은 곧바로 대응했습니다. 엔화 가치를 올리는 ‘플라자 합의’로 일본의 수출 경쟁력을 꺾고, 반도체 협정을 맺어 일본 기업들이 만든 반도체의 가격과 시장 점유율에 관여하기 시작했죠.\n미국과의 무역에 기대 성장한 일본에는 뼈아픈 견제였습니다. 결국 일본은 버블 붕괴와 함께 ‘잃어버린 20년’을 맞이하게 됩니다.\n중국과의 싸움은\n조금 더 복잡하고 어렵다\n소련도 눌렀고 일본도 눌렀으니, 중국과의 대결에서도 미국이 간단히 승리할까요? 생각만큼 그리 간단하지 않습니다. 중국은 과거 라이벌인 소련과 일본보다 훨씬 까다로운 상대거든요.\n\n중국은 소련처럼 체제가 달라 동맹을 맺기는 어려운 상대인데, 일본처럼 무역으로 긴밀히 얽혀 있어 완전히 끊어내기도 어렵기 때문입니다. 이른바 ‘복합 경쟁자’인 셈이죠.\n게다가 중국은 과거 소련과 일본의 사례에서 교훈도 얻었어요. 소련처럼 무리한 군비 경쟁에 뛰어들지도 않고, 일본처럼 불리한 협상 테이블에 앉지도 않고 있죠. 대신 수출과 내수 시장을 함께 키우는 ‘쌍순환 전략’으로 버틸 힘을 기르겠다는 영리한 전략을 펴고 있어요.\n투자자는 어떻게 대응해야 할까요?\n1. 장기전을 염두에 두기\n미국과 중국의 갈등은 길어질 거예요. 두 나라의 복잡한 관계를 고려했을 때, 미국과 중국의 갈등이 단기간에 끝나진 않을 거거든요. 그러니 앞으로 장기전이 될 가능성이 높다는 걸 염두에 두셔야 해요.\n2. 기술 패권 경쟁에 주목하기\n기술 패권을 둘러싼 치열한 경쟁은 기술 기업에게 기회가 될 수 있어요.css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}. 두 나라 모두 기술 패권을 유지하는 것이 얼마나 중요한 일인지 잘 알고 있기 때문에, 경쟁이 치열할수록 산업의 성장 속도도 빨라질 거예요. 인공지능, 우주, 로봇 등 기술 패권을 좌우할 분야는 이미 윤곽이 드러나고 있습니다.\n3. 잠재적 리스크 관리하기\n지속되는 갈등은 잠재적인 리스크예요. 미·중 갈등이 언제든 다시 격화될 수 있다는 점을 염두에 둘 필요가 있어요. 세계 1, 2위 국가의 충돌은 글로벌 증시에 큰 충격을 줄 수 있어요. 이는 트럼프의 임기가 끝나든, 집권 정당이 바뀌든 마찬가지입니다. 미·중 갈등을 사라지지 않을 ‘상수’로 받아들이는 것이 중요합니다.\n\n💡 다음 글 예고\n\n트럼프 2기 정부 출범과 함께 신설된 DOGE(정부효율부), 혹시 잊으셨나요?\n우리가 워싱턴에서 만난 기업 관계자들은 하나같이 DOGE(Department of Government Efficiency)의 영향력에 대해 이야기하고 있었어요. 다음 글에서는 DOGE 의 진짜 목적은 무엇이며 향후 미국 경제에는 어떤 영향을 미칠지, 기업과 언론, 정치권의 평가는 어떤지, 결국 투자자가 알아야 할 것들은 무엇일지에 대해 말씀드리겠습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter 한상원 애널리스트 Edit 기명균 윤동해 Graphic 윤자영",
