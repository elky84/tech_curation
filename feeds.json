With help from our fantastic C++ community, we gathered insights and addressed key feedback. We’re happy to share that GitHub Copilot build performance for Windows is now in Public Preview. Today, all C++ developers can try out the new capabilities in the latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\n“I’ve tried the feature for a few hours and I’m happily impressed. The agent provided accurate suggestions, implemented them, and managed to reduce my build time by about 20%.” – Alessandro Vergani, ARGO Vision\nOptimizing Build Times with GitHub Copilot\nWhen you use this new capability in Visual Studio, GitHub Copilot will use an agent to:\nInitiate a build and capture a diagnostic trace\nIdentify bottlenecks in the following areas:\n\nexpensive headers\nlong function generation times\ncostly template instantiations\nSuggest and apply optimizations\nValidate changes through rebuilds so your code stays correct\nReport measurable improvements and recommend next steps\nTo see how it works in action, please watch our demo below.\n\nLearn more: Documentation for GitHub Copilot build performance for Windows | Microsoft Learn\nUsing GitHub Copilot build performance for Windows\nThere are several ways to start the new build performance capabilities:\n1. Select the responder in Copilot Chat by typing “@BuildPerfCpp”\n\n2. Select menu entry Build > Run Build Insights > Improve build performance\n\n3. If you already have a .etl trace file open from Build Insights, click Improve on the top right corner of the report view. The view or tab you click from gives GitHub Copilot important context to focus on the relevant hot spots when the chat session begins.\n\nOnce you start a chat session from any of the entry points above, GitHub Copilot begins analyzing your build and offering suggestions to reduce build time. It will iterate on these optimizations until your build completes successfully. You’ll always have final approval on whether to apply the changes.\nUsing The Build Insights Tool\nTo start trace collection, GitHub Copilot will ask your permission to run the Build Insights tool.\n\nIf it is your first time using Build Insights, you will need to grant a one-time elevated request.\n \nLearn more: Build Insights needs additional permissions | Microsoft Learn\nTemplate Instantiation Collection\nTo collect template information, you must opt-in via Tools > Options > Build Insights > Trace Collection > Collect template instantiation.\nDefault Report Location\nBy default, your reports will be saved in %TEMP%/BuildInsights. You can customize the save location at Tools > Options > Build Insights > Trace Collection > Override default location for saved reports.\nShare your feedback\nWe’d love to hear feedback on how we can improve GitHub Copilot build performance for Windows.

        "pubDate": "Fri, 23 Jan 2026 16:17:13 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We released Spring Debugger in May 2025 to bring more clarity to the “magic” behind Spring Boot – helping you see what’s really happening inside your running application. By the end of 2025, the plugin had reached more than 300,000 unique downloads and became a trusted tool within the developer community.\nWe’ve received a lot of valuable feedback, including feature requests, bug reports, and improvement ideas. Surprisingly, this was the most common question:\n“Can I debug remote applications?”\nIn this version, we’re happy to say that yes, you can.\nRemote debug with Spring Debugger\nWhen we started developing Spring Debugger, one of our cornerstone principles was:\n“We do not want to use any debug agents.”\nAdding agents to local code often makes setup harder, increases maintenance overhead, and can interfere with the debugging process. We decided to keep this approach for remote debugging as well.\nThe main challenge in remote debugging was gathering bean information after attaching to the app.\nIn the local setup, that’s simple – we set a non-suspending breakpoint in the method that finalizes Spring context initialization and then read all beans from the context. Remotely, however, the application is already running, and the context is fully initialized when we attach.\nContainer threading model and debugging\nOur current solution is to suspend one of the servlet-container threads and read the Spring context from that thread. This approach is where our decision to avoid using debug agents is truly tested.\nThe behavior of Spring Debugger depends on which embedded servlet container your Spring Boot app is using, as each container handles network I/O and worker threads differently.\nWith Apache Tomcat, the connector maintains a pool of worker threads as soon as the server starts. Because these threads are available and ready before any HTTP request arrives, the Spring Debugger can hook into one of them immediately after startup and fetch the Spring application context.\nBy contrast, with Eclipse Jetty or Undertow, the thread model is more layered. For example, Jetty uses separate producer (I/O) threads and worker (task) threads submitted to an Executor. \nUndertow uses I/O (event‐loop) threads for non‐blocking network handling and dispatches to worker threads for actual request processing. \nBecause a fully available worker thread with access to the Spring context can only appear once a request is processed, the debugger cannot load context information until the first incoming connection.\nIn short, when running on Tomcat, Spring Debugger can present the context immediately. When running on Jetty/Undertow, there is a slight delay in context loading before the first HTTP request. This is not a bug – it is a design trade-off linked to our agent-free inspection approach.\nYou can still debug remote Spring applications with nearly all Spring Debugger features – the main difference is when the context becomes available for inspection.\nHow to configure remote debugging\nThe process is the same as standard JVM remote debugging – run your application with an open debug port and connect using the Remote JVM Debug configuration.\nFor example, in a Docker Compose setup on a remote server:\nhttp-server:\n depends_on:\n   - postgresql\n image: 'jb/http-server:latest'\n environment:\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://postgresql:5432/db\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=user\n   - SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=secret\n   - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005\n ports:\n   - '8080:8080'\n   - '5005:5005'\n\n\n\n\nThe key line is:\nJAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005\n\n\n\n\nThis is a well-known option for enabling remote debugging. It opens port 5005 for debugger connections and exposes it from the container.\nTo start debugging, create a Remote JVM Debug configuration in IntelliJ IDEA and make sure to specify the correct module classpath.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it – you can now debug the remote application, inspect property values, evaluate bean expressions, and analyze transactions right inside your IDE.\nLimitations\nRemote debugging differs slightly from local debugging, but there are a few limitations:\nOnly embedded containers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow) are currently supported.\nYou need to specify the module classpath in your run configuration.\nDatabase connections are shown, but the database structure view is not available.\nThe last point might be disappointing, but direct access to a remote database is often not technically possible – it may be inside a Docker network, a separate environment, or behind a firewall. We’re working on finding a solution, but this will take some time.\nConclusion\nThe new version of Spring Debugger takes another step toward application troubleshooting by adding remote attach support. Even if you’ve never tried remote debugging before, you’ll find the process almost identical to local debugging – just open a port and connect from IntelliJ IDEA.\nNo agents, no actuators, just a standard remote port and a regular debug session.\nSimply hit Debug and dive into your running application – inspect beans, properties, transactions, and use extended expression evaluation capabilities.\nWe’re exploring optional agent-based extensions for environments where deeper introspection is worth the trade-off, and we’d love to hear your feedback.\nHappy coding!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ktor 3.4.0 improves stability and addresses outstanding issues. Highlights include OpenAPI generation, Ztsd support for the compression plugin, duplex streaming for OkHttp, Structured concurrency integrations for the HTTP request lifecycle, and much more. For a detailed list of all the changes, check out the What’s new page.\nStability and performance\nWith its focus on stability and fixes for some long-standing issues, this release ensures Ktor is ready for another year of amazing development! \nBecause stability and performance remain among our top priorities heading into the new year, we want to invite all of you again to join the Ktor Early Access Program and help us test new versions and features. Start building your next project at start.ktor.io. Your suggestions and contributions are always welcome!\nGet Started With Ktor 3.4.0\n         \nOpenAPI generation from code\nIn 3.4.0, we completed the story for OpenAPI document generation by introducing a new API for dynamically documenting endpoints that works in tandem with a new compiler plugin. Now, instead of building your Swagger frontend from a static file, the model is built at runtime from details embedded in the routing tree.\nTo generate your documentation, you can enable it through the Ktor Gradle plugin, then it will automatically provide details in your code via the new describe API:\n/**\n * Our existing plugins work with the information found in the routes.\n */\nswaggerUI(\"/docs\") {\n    // Customize the result with general details\n    info = OpenApiInfo(\"KChat API\", \"1.0.0\")\n}\n\n/**\n * Get a list of messages.\n * \n * Query parameters: \n *  - search [String] a search query\n */\nget(\"/messages\") {\n    val query = call.parameters[\"search\"]?.parseQueryOrNull()\n    call.respond(messageTable.listMessages(query))\n}.describe {\n    // This code is generated from the code above\n    summary = \"Get a list of messages\"\n    parameters {\n        query(\"q\") {\n            description = \"a search query\"\n        }\n    }\n    responses {\n        HttpStatusCode.OK {\n            schema = jsonSchema<Message>()\n        }\n    }\n}\nDuplex streaming for OkHttp\nThe OkHttp client engine now supports duplex streaming, enabling clients to send request body data and receive response data simultaneously, in contrast to regular HTTP calls, where the request body must be fully sent before the response begins.\nDuplex streaming is available for HTTP/2 connections and can be enabled using the new duplexStreamingEnabled property in OkHttpConfig:\nval client = HttpClient(OkHttp) {\n    engine {\n        duplexStreamingEnabled = true\n        config {\n            protocols(listOf(Protocol.H2_PRIOR_KNOWLEDGE))\n        }\n    }\n}\nZstd compression support\nThe Compression plugin now supports Ztsd via the new ktor-server-compression-zstd module. Zstd is a fast compression algorithm that offers high compression ratios, low compression times, and a configurable compression level.  To set this level, call the zstd function from inside the compression block:\ninstall(Compression) {\n   zstd {\n       compressionLevel = 3\n       ...\n   }\n}\nHttpRequestLifecycle\nThe new HttpRequestLifecycle plugin allows you to cancel in-flight HTTP requests when the client disconnects, which is useful when you need to cancel a long-running or resource-intensive in-flight request. Simply install the HttpRequestLifecycle plugin and set cancelCallOnClose = true:\ninstall(HttpRequestLifecycle) {\n    cancelCallOnClose = true\n}\n\nrouting {\n    get(\"/long-process\") {\n        try {\n            while (isActive) {\n                delay(10_000)\n                logger.info(\"Very important work.\")\n            }\n            call.respond(\"Completed\")\n        } catch (e: CancellationException) {\n            logger.info(\"Cleaning up resources.\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nWhen the client disconnects, the coroutine handling the request is canceled, along with any launch or async coroutines started by it, and structured concurrency cleans all resources. This is currently only supported for the Netty and CIO engines.\n🚀 Thank you!\nWe want to thank everyone in the community for your support and feedback, as well as for reporting issues.\nStart building your next project at start.ktor.io.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The ReSharper 2026.1 Early Access Program is now open, and the first EAP build brings a mix of C# productivity improvements, new inspections, performance work, and expanded C++ language support.\nAs always, EAP builds are an opportunity to try upcoming features early and help us refine them before the final release. Here’s what’s new in ReSharper 2026.1 EAP 1.\nDownload ReSharper 2026.1\n                                                    \nNote: .NET runtime for ReSharper 2026.1 in Out-of-Process (OOP) mode has been updated to .NET 10.\n\r\n\n        \nС# updates\nSmarter code generation and completion\nThe Generate | Partial Members action now supports generating partial member definitions, making it easier to work with partial types spread across multiple files.\nCode completion has also been improved for logging scenarios. After applying the\n[LoggerMessage(\"your message here\")] attribute, ReSharper can now generate the corresponding method definition directly from completion, streamlining structured logging workflows. [RSRP-495191]\nCleaner extension method declarations\nA new Consolidate extension members context action helps reduce fragmentation in extension code. When multiple compatible extension declarations and classic extension methods are present, ReSharper can now merge them into a single extension block. This keeps extension-heavy codebases easier to read and navigate, especially as they grow.\nTo see the new context action in action, try this example:\npublic static class ListExtensions\n{\n    public static List<T> GetSortedList<T>(this List<T> list)\n    {\n        list.Sort();\n        return list;\n    }\n    extension<T>(List<T> list)\n    {\n        public T? GetMaxElement() => list.Max();\n        public T? GetMinElement() => list.Min();\n    }\n    extension<T>(List<T> list)\n    {\n        public T GetFirstElement() => list.First();\n        public T GetLastElement() => list.Last();\n    }\n}\nPlace the caret inside one of the extension<T>(List<T> list) blocks and invoke Consolidate extension members to see ReSharper merge the compatible declarations into a single, cleaner extension definition.\nAnd here’s what you would get as a result:\npublic static class ListExtensions\n{\n    extension<T>(List<T> list)\n    {\n        public List<T> GetSortedCollection()\n        {\n            list.Sort();\n            return list;\n        }\n        public T? GetMaxElement() => list.Max();\n        public T? GetMinElement() => list.Min();\n        public T GetFirstElement() => list.First();\n        public T GetLastElement() => list.Last();\n    }\n}\nNew inspections \nTwo new inspections focus on correctness and runtime safety:\nImmutableArray initialization: ReSharper now detects cases where ImmutableArray<T> is used with collection initializers, leading to a runtime exception, and offers a quick-fix to use ImmutableArray.Create instead. [RSRP-502408]\nShort-lived HttpClient usage: A new inspection highlights patterns where HttpClient instances are repeatedly created and disposed. ReSharper warns about the risk of socket exhaustion and guides you toward safer alternatives, such as reusing instances or using IHttpClientFactory. \nPerformance\nWe’ve optimized several performance-critical code paths to significantly reduce costly clr!JIT_IsInstanceOfInterface runtime checks, resulting in faster code analysis and lower overhead.\nReSharper C++\nLanguage support\nThis preview build introduces:\nInitial support for C++23 floating-point types: bfloat16_t, float16_t, and float128_t.\nSupport for the C23 _Countof operator.\nGCC nested functions are now recognized correctly.\nEditor and navigation\nEAP 1 improves gutter marks with colorized tooltips for better readability [RSCPP-37086], and marks for base classes, making inheritance hierarchies easier to navigate [RSCPP-37085].\nProject model\nThe Library Directories project property is now respected when resolving #import directives [RSCPP-37070].\nReSharper now offers improved handling of WinUI 3 projects. [RSCPP-37089]\nInspections\nThe Symbol is never used inspection now applies to members of class definitions in .cpp files.\nDynamic Program Analysis (DPA) to be sunset\nDynamic Program Analysis (DPA) in ReSharper is evolving. Starting with ReSharper 2026.1, DPA will be sunset as a standalone feature. Its analytical capabilities are being consolidated into a reimagined, more comprehensive performance monitoring experience within ReSharper, modeled after the one we’ve implemented in Rider. \nFor the complete list of feature updates and resolved issues, please refer to our issue tracker. \nGive it a try\nReSharper 2026.1 EAP 1 is available now. You can install it alongside your stable version and start exploring the new features today.\nAs always, we’d love to hear your feedback. If you run into issues or have suggestions, please report them via our issue tracker so we can address them early in the release cycle.\nHappy coding—and thank you for helping shape ReSharper 2026.1!\nDownload ReSharper 2026.1",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Early Access Program (EAP) for Rider 2026.1 has just begun, and the first preview build for the upcoming major release is already out. \nThere are several ways for you to get your hands on the first preview build:\nDownload and install it from our website.\nGet it via the Toolbox App.\nInstall this snap package from the SnapCraft store if you’re using a compatible Linux distribution.\nDownload Rider 2026.1 EAP 1\n                                                    \nA reminder of what the EAP is all about\nThe Early Access Program is a long-standing tradition that gives our users early access to the new features we’re preparing. By participating, you get a first look at what’s coming and a chance to help shape the final release through your feedback.\nEAP builds are free to use, though they may be less stable than the final release versions. You can learn more about the EAP and why you might want to participate here.\nAnd now on to Rider 2026.1 EAP 1 release highlights.\nC# language support\nFor the latest updates to C# support, please check out the ReSharper 2026.1 EAP 1 blog post for ReSharper. \nAzure DevOps integration: Cloning repositories from Rider\nIf your team uses Azure DevOps, you can now clone repositories directly from Rider using the new bundled Azure DevOps plugin for JetBrains Rider.\nTo get started, go to File | Open | Get from Version Control from the main menu. From the Clone Repository dialog, select Azure DevOps from the list of version control providers. Rider authenticates using a personal access token (PAT), which you generate in Azure DevOps and then use to sign in from within the IDE. Once authenticated, Rider shows a list of repositories available to you, so you can select and clone them without leaving the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nAt this stage, the plugin focuses on the most common and reliable workflow: repository cloning via PAT-based authentication. This approach matches how authentication works for other organization-based Git providers in Rider and avoids frequent reauthentication or token refresh issues.\nThis is just the beginning of Azure DevOps support in Rider. We plan to expand the integration over time with additional baseline workflows. If you’re looking for more advanced Azure DevOps functionality today, the community-driven azd plugin is a great complement to the functionality already available in Rider.\nNuGet PowerShell commands support in the Package Manager Console\nRider now offers a Package Manager Console (PMC) in preview, bringing NuGet’s PowerShell-based workflow into the IDE.\nThe new console supports standard NuGet PowerShell commands, as well as commands provided by NuGet packages themselves. Entity Framework Core PowerShell commands such as Add-Migration, Update-Database, and Scaffold-DbContext are fully supported, enabling familiar EF Core workflows without leaving Rider. Broader command coverage will continue to expand based on user feedback.\nYou can access the PMC in two places:\nAs a dedicated tab in the NuGet tool window\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a predefined session in the Terminal tool window\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth options let you run the same commands, but differ slightly in how context is handled. In the NuGet tool window, you can select the package source and default project using UI controls. In the terminal-based console, this context is shown as part of the PowerShell prompt and can be changed using PowerShell commands.\nThis preview is about finding the right balance between flexibility and convenience for our users. Your feedback will help us decide which experience to refine and carry forward into the final release. Please share your feedback in the comments under this ticket or in the comment section below this post.\n.NET mixed-mode debugging on Windows\nRider 2026.1 introduces mixed-mode debugging, which lets you debug both managed (.NET and .NET Framework) and native (C/C++) code in a single debugging session.\nThis is particularly useful for applications that cross managed-native boundaries, such as .NET code calling into native libraries or game engines and tools built from a mix of managed and native components.\n\n\n\n\nYou can start a mixed-mode debugging session in two ways:\nOpen your run configuration and enable the Use mixed mode debug checkbox. When you start debugging, Rider will attach both the .NET and native debuggers automatically.\nOpen Run | Attach to Process, select a running process, and choose Attach with .NET and Native Debuggers. This attaches both debuggers to the same process, allowing you to step across managed and native code without having to restart the application.\nPlease note that .NET mixed-mode debugging is currently available only on Windows. Please leave your feedback on this ticket.\nThe ability to inspect .NET assembly output\nRider now offers a .NET Disassembler via a custom plugin that lets you inspect the native disassembly generated for your C# code directly in the IDE.\nYou can view the native disassembly generated from your C# code, along with output from the JIT, ReadyToRun, and NativeAOT compilers in the ASM Viewer tool window, which is available through the new plugin. This makes the feature particularly useful when working on performance-sensitive code, low-level optimizations, SIMD-heavy paths, or when validating how code changes affect the final machine instructions.\n\n\n\n\nThe .NET Disassembler is designed for use during development. You can open it directly from your C# code and inspect the generated assembly side by side with the source. Rider also supports:\nConfigurable compiler options such as tiered compilation and PGO.\nSnapshots and diff views to compare assembly output before and after code changes.\nSyntax highlighting for x86/x64 and ARM64 assembly.\nThe introduction of this plugin is our answer to long-standing requests from developers who need visibility beyond IL and want to understand what actually runs on the CPU, without repeatedly rebuilding projects or switching to external tools.\nEnhanced integration with the Godot Editor\nThis release introduces a Godot Editor addon that enhances the way Rider works with Godot Engine projects.\nWhen you enable the JetBrains Rider External Editor addon in the Godot Editor, it automatically detects your installed Rider versions and configures Godot to work with Rider as the external IDE. It also applies a set of recommended editor settings to optimize your workflow – helping with project opening, file navigation, and debugging.\nCombined with Rider’s Godot Support plugin (now bundled with the IDE), this enables:\nAutomatic Godot project discovery in Rider.\nGeneration of run/debug configurations for Godot scenes.\nCode insight and navigation for both GDScript and C#.\nIntegrated debugging with scene variables and node context.\n\n\n\n\n\nInspect the sources of the addon to see how GDExtension can be developed in JetBrains Rider at any OS.\nSearch for “JetBrains Rider Integration” on the AssetLib inside GodotEditor to get started.\nImproved Natvis expression evaluation\nC++ debugging in Rider now uses a new standalone parser and evaluator for Natvis expressions. This improves the reliability and correctness of expression evaluation, including conditional breakpoints and custom visualizers, without relying on Clang or JIT compilation.\nC++ naming rules improvements\nRider now offers a more flexible C++ naming rules configuration. The updated settings page lets you edit naming rules [RIDER-121211], apply predefined naming styles [RIDER-132026], and define abbreviations [RIDER-52334], making it easier to align code style with your team’s conventions.\nFor the full list of changes included in this build, please see our issue tracker.\nWe encourage you to download the EAP build, give these new features a try, and share your feedback. The Early Access Program is a collaborative effort, and your input plays a vital role in making Rider the best it can be.\nDownload Rider 2026.1 EAP 1\n                                                    \nThank you for being part of our EAP community, and we look forward to hearing what you think!",

        "pubDate": "Thu, 22 Jan 2026 13:31:12 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Cameron Pavey, draft.dev.\nDeveloper experience (DevEx) directly correlates with engineering performance, which in turn drives competitive advantage. \nAnd yet many software engineering teams continue to operate on legacy CI/CD platforms that create unnecessary friction, burn developer hours, and ultimately limit business growth.\nWhile some teams remain trapped by outdated infrastructure, others benefit from modern toolchains that drive measurable performance improvements. Organizations that use performant CI/CD platforms achieve deployment frequencies that are measured in hours rather than weeks, lead times shortened by orders of magnitude, and change failure rates that preserve both customer trust and developer confidence.\nThis article explains why partial and incremental fixes to legacy systems consistently fail and how modern, developer-centric platforms like TeamCity reclaim developer productivity and deliver a measurable return on investment (ROI).\nThe drag of legacy CI/CD on business performance\nLegacy CI/CD platforms, such as aging installations of the once-ubiquitous Jenkins, and fragmented toolchains create systematic inefficiencies that compound across every aspect of software delivery. These systems weren’t designed for the velocity and complexity that modern development demands. \nYet organizations continue operating them, often falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy, where past investments in these platforms feel too significant to abandon despite the ongoing toll on efficiency and developer productivity.\nFragmented CI/CD environments require significant engineering attention that could otherwise focus on product development. A typical legacy setup might involve Jenkins for builds, separate tools for testing, manual deployment orchestration, and disconnected monitoring systems. Each extra tool and integration introduces potential points of failure and requires specialized knowledge to maintain.\nConsider the developer experience: A single pipeline failure can require understanding YAML syntax, shell scripting, plugin compatibility, and infrastructure state. Developers spend hours debugging build environments instead of shipping features. Engineering teams report as much as 20 percent of weekly time lost to inefficiencies, technical debt, maintenance, and tooling issues rather than product work.\nThis productivity drain can be quantified. The DORA research exposes exactly how legacy platforms hinder performance. Organizations using outdated CI/CD typically demonstrate:\nDeployment frequency: monthly or quarterly releases instead of multiple daily deployments\nLead time for changes: weeks from commit to production instead of hours\nChange failure rate: 15–45 percent, while elite performers are at 0–15 percent\nMean time to recovery: hours or days instead of less than one hour\nThese metrics represent opportunity costs. Where elite-performing teams iterate rapidly and respond to market changes within hours, teams constrained by legacy systems operate at fundamentally different competitive speeds and cannot leverage the same opportunities.\nPerformance limitations also have organizational consequences that affect talent retention and operational stability. Talented engineers leave organizations where they spend more time fighting infrastructure than building products. Surveys show that inadequate tools and inefficient CI/CD processes rank among the top factors in turnover decisions for developers.\nAdditionally, pipeline fragility creates operational risk. Legacy systems often require manual intervention during critical deployments, which increases the likelihood of human error during critical releases. The resulting incidents consume engineering attention, erode customer trust, and require expensive postmortem processes.\nMany organizations that recognize these problems make incremental improvements in an attempt to modernize their legacy CI/CD setup. They add new plugins to Jenkins, implement additional monitoring tools, or create wrapper scripts to reduce complexity.\nHowever, incremental approaches fail to address the fundamental architectural limitations that hinder performance.\nIn fact, partial fixes usually create additional complexity rather than reducing it. New tools introduce additional integration points, require separate maintenance overhead, and create inconsistent developer experiences across different projects.\nHeavily customized legacy systems often become even more difficult to operate than standard configurations.\nThe ROI of DevEx: How TeamCity delivers measurable returns\nModern, integrated CI/CD platforms like TeamCity enable elite performance through features specifically designed for developer productivity and operational reliability.\nElite teams using integrated platforms deploy 208 times more frequently than others, reduce lead times from months to days, and cut recovery times from weeks to just hours. These improvements result in reclaimed developer productivity, accelerated feature delivery, and reduced operational risk.\nLet’s examine the specific capabilities that drive these returns:\nIntuitive UI and build-chain visualization\nTeamCity’s visual build-chain interface eliminates the cognitive overhead associated with complex YAML configurations and fragmented toolchains. Developers can understand pipeline dependencies, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues without specialized configuration knowledge.\nDeveloper benefit: New team members become productive in hours rather than weeks. Experienced developers spend time building features instead of deciphering pipeline syntax. Surveys suggest that developers can reclaim up to a day per week when toolchain and process inefficiencies are reduced.\nBusiness ROI: Higher engineer productivity translates to more features shipped per sprint and lower effective staffing costs per project. Let’s say you have a team of ten developers, each earning around $100K. Saving three hours per week could mean $75,000+ annually in reclaimed productivity.\nDeep SCM and VCS integration\nTeamCity provides easy integration with modern version control systems, automatically triggering builds based on commit patterns and providing contextual information about changes. This eliminates manual build triggers and reduces the errors associated with disconnected systems.\nDeveloper benefit: Developers commit code and immediately receive build feedback without manual intervention. Contextual commit information enables faster debugging when issues occur. Teams eliminate the fifteen to thirty minutes typically required for manual build coordination, as well as the overhead of switching contexts.\nBusiness ROI: Accelerated feedback cycles enable faster iteration and reduce the compound costs of late-discovered defects. Faster feedback loops, better automation, and more reliable pipelines substantially improve cycle time, which allows organizations to ship revenue-generating features faster, reduce time-to-market for new products, and increase the frequency of customer-facing improvements.\nAdvanced test intelligence\nThe developer experience of your CI platform directly determines how readily your team will adopt and maintain comprehensive test automation. TeamCity’s advanced testing capabilities – like predictive test selection, flaky test detection, and historical test analytics – remove friction from the testing workflow and make robust quality gates practical rather than aspirational.\nDeveloper benefit: Fast, reliable test feedback enables developers to confidently execute code changes. Flaky tests no longer interrupt development flow or create false-positive alerts. Intelligent parallelization decreases test execution time by as much as 40–60 percent. And because the test parallelization is dynamic, the speed benefits can scale as new tests are added without drastically increasing run times.\nBusiness ROI: Better automated quality control reduces defect escape costs and lowers incidents that impact customers.\nReal-time monitoring and extensible plugins\nTeamCity provides unified visibility across builds, tests, security scans, and infrastructure status through a single interface. The extensive plugin ecosystem enables teams to integrate with existing tools while maintaining consistent monitoring and alerting.\nDeveloper benefit: Unified insight eliminates the context switching required to understand system state across multiple tools. Developers identify and resolve issues faster through consolidated monitoring. Custom plugins enable adaptation to evolve technology stacks without platform migration.\nBusiness ROI: With fragmented toolchains, engineering teams spend substantial time configuring, maintaining, and monitoring disparate plugins and integrations, spending effort that delivers no direct customer value. TeamCity’s unified monitoring approach reduces this operational overhead so that engineers can focus on feature development rather than pipeline maintenance.\nScalable, performance-tuned architecture\nTeamCity Cloud’s architecture scales efficiently as organizations grow, maintaining build performance even as project complexity increases. This eliminates the need for frequent replatforming and provides predictable operational costs. Because TeamCity Cloud’s infrastructure is managed for you, you also don’t need to worry about runners becoming outdated or aging out of usefulness as your application grows in complexity.\nDeveloper benefit: Build times remain consistent as projects grow. Developers avoid the productivity hits associated with infrastructure capacity constraints. Teams can focus on feature development rather than infrastructure scaling decisions.\nBusiness ROI: Deferred infrastructure spending and predictable operational expenses enable better budget planning. Organizations avoid the disruption and costs associated with emergency platform migrations when existing systems reach capacity limits.\nIn summary\nElite-performing teams operate at fundamentally different speeds than their competitors, enabling them to respond to market opportunities, recover from incidents, and iterate on customer feedback rapidly.\nUpgrading to a developer-centric CI/CD platform like TeamCity is an investment with clear returns: reclaimed developer productivity, accelerated feature delivery, reduced operational risk, and improved customer satisfaction. Some organizations report payback in mere months when automation and tooling investments eliminate inefficiencies and reduce cycle times, though results depend on your organization’s scale and context.\nThe real risk lies in inaction.\nWhile competitors migrate to modern platforms and achieve elite performance levels, organizations that maintain legacy systems fall further behind in capability and competitive position. The performance gap between elite and low-performing organizations continues to widen as modern platforms enable increasingly sophisticated development practices.\nIf your legacy tooling is holding your teams back and hampering performance, it might be time to make a change.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This post was written together with Thorben Janssen, who has more than 20 years of experience with JPA and Hibernate and is the author of “Hibernate Tips: More than 70 Solutions to Common Hibernate Problems” and the JPA newsletter.\nKotlin and Jakarta Persistence (also known as JPA) are a popular combination for server-side development. Kotlin offers concise syntax and modern language features, while Jakarta Persistence provides a proven persistence framework for enterprise applications.\nHowever, Jakarta Persistence was originally designed for Java. Some of Kotlin’s popular features and concepts, like null safety and data classes, help you tremendously when implementing your business logic, but they don’t align well with the specification.\nThis article outlines a set of best practices to help you avoid problems and build reliable persistence layers with Kotlin and Jakarta Persistence. And to share some good news before diving in, IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1 will automatically detect many of these issues, highlight them with warnings, and provide support through various inspections.\nEntity class design\nJakarta Persistence defines several requirements for entity classes that form the foundation for how persistence providers manage entity objects.\nAn entity class must:\nProvide a no-argument constructor\nThe persistence provider uses reflection to call the no-argument constructor to create entity instances when loading data from the database.\nHave non-final attributes\nWhen fetching an entity object from the database, the persistence provider sets all attribute values after it calls the no-argument constructor to instantiate the entity object. This process is called hydration.\nAfter that is done, the persistence provider keeps a reference to the entity object to perform automatic dirty checks, during which it detects changes and updates the corresponding database records automatically.\nBe non-final\nThe persistence provider often creates proxy subclasses to implement features such as lazy loading for @ManyToOne and @OneToOne relationships. For this to work, the entity class can’t be final.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these specification requirements, it is a widely accepted best practice to:\nImplement equals, hashCode, and toString carefully\nThese methods should rely only on the entity’s identifier and type to avoid unexpected behavior in persistence contexts. You can find approaches for better implementing those here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese rules are easy to follow in Java but conflict with some of Kotlin’s defaults, such as final classes, immutable properties, and constructor-based initialization.\nThe following sections show how to adapt your Kotlin classes to meet these requirements while still using Kotlin’s language features effectively.\nData classes vs. entities\nKotlin’s data classes are designed to hold data. They are final and provide several utility methods, including getters and setters for all fields, as well as equals, hashCode, and toString.\nThis makes data classes a great fit for DTOs, which represent query results and are not managed by your persistence provider.\nBelow is a typical usage of a data class to fetch data:\ndata class EmployeeWithCompany(val employeeName: String, val companyName: String)\n\nval query = entityManager.createQuery(\"\"\"\n   SELECT new com.company.kotlin.model.EmployeeWithCompany(p.name, c.name)\n    FROM Employee e\n       JOIN e.company c\n    WHERE p.id = :id\"\"\")\n\nval employeeWithCompany = query.setParameter(\"id\", 1L).singleResult;\nHowever, entities differ because they are managed objects. And that causes problems when you model them as a data class.\nFor entities, the persistence provider automatically detects changes and uses lazy loading for relationships. To support this, it expects entity classes to follow the requirements defined in the Jakarta Persistence specification, which we discussed at the beginning of this chapter. \nAs you can see in the following table, that makes Kotlin’s data classes a bad fit for entity classes.\n\nKotlin Data ClassJakarta Persistence Entity\nClass TypeFinalMust be open (non-final) so the provider can create proxy subclasses\nConstructorsPrimary constructor with required parametersMust provide a no-argument constructor, used by the persistence provider\nMutabilityImmutable by default (val properties)Must have mutable, non-final attributes so the provider can perform lazy loading as well as detect and persist changes\nequals and hashCodeUse all propertiesShould rely only on type and primary key\ntoStringIncludes all propertiesShould only reference eagerly loaded attributes to avoid additional queries\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended approach is to use regular open classes to model your entities. They are mutable and proxy-friendly, and they don’t cause any issues with Jakarta Persistence.\n@Entity\nopen class Person {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n}\nNon-final classes and no-argument constructors\nAs discussed earlier, Jakarta Persistence requires entity classes to be non-final and provide a no-argument constructor. \nKotlin’s classes are final by default and don’t have to offer a no-argument constructor.\nBut don’t worry, it’s easy to fulfill the requirements without changing your code or implementing your entity classes in a specific way. Just add the no-arg and all-open plugins and add kotlin-reflect to your dependencies. This adds the required constructor and marks annotated classes as open at build time.\nCurrently, you need the compiler plugins plugin.spring and plugin.jpa, which will automatically add the no-arg and all-open plugins. When creating a new Spring project using the New Project wizard in IntelliJ IDEA or via start.spring.io, both plugins are automatically configured for you. And starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1, this will also be the case when you add a Kotlin file to an existing Java project.\nplugins {\n   kotlin(\"plugin.spring\") version \"2.2.20\"\n   kotlin(\"plugin.jpa\") version \"2.2.20\"\n}\n\nallOpen {\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Entity\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.MappedSuperclass\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Embeddable\")\n}\nWhen configuring this manually, pay close attention to both parts of this setup. plugin.jpa appears to provide the required configuration, but it only configures the no-arg plugin, not the all-open one. This will be improved with the upcoming JPA plugin update. You will then no longer have to add the allOpen section. See: KT-79389\nMutability\nAs a Kotlin developer, you’re used to analyzing whether information is mutable or immutable and modelling your classes accordingly. And when defining your entities, you might want to do the same. But that creates potential issues.\nvar vs. val\nIn Kotlin, you use val to define an immutable field or property and var for mutable ones. Under the hood, val is compiled in Java to a final field. But as discussed earlier, the Jakarta Persistence specification requires all fields to be non-final.\nSo, in theory, you can’t use val when modelling your entities. However, if you look at various projects, you can find several entities that use val without causing any bugs.\n@Entity\nclass Person(name: String) {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String = name\n}\nThat’s because your Jakarta Persistence implementation, the persistence provider, populates entity fields through reflection if you use field-based access, which is usually the case when implementing Jakarta Persistence entities in Kotlin. final fields can also be modified using reflection. As a result, your persistence provider can modify val fields, but this contradicts Kotlin’s immutability guarantees.\nSo, practically, you can use val to model immutable fields of your entity class. Still, it’s not in line with the Jakarta Persistence specification, and your fields are not as immutable as you might expect. To make it even worse, JEP 500: Prepare to Make Final Mean Final discusses introducing a warning and future changes to restrict final field modifications via reflection. This would prevent you from using val on your entity fields and break many persistence layers using Jakarta Persistence and Kotlin.\nBe careful when using val for your entity fields and make sure everyone on your team understands the implications.\nStarting with version 2026.1, IntelliJ IDEA will display a weak warning indicating that a val field will be modified when the persistence provider, such as Hibernate or EclipseLink, instantiates the entity object.\nAccess types\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification defines two access types that determine if your persistence provider uses getter and setter methods to access your entity’s fields or reflection.\nYou can define the access type explicitly by annotating your entity class with the @Access annotation. Or, as almost all development teams do, define it implicitly by where you place your mapping annotations:\nAnnotations on entity fields → field access = direct access using reflection\nAnnotations on getter methods → property access = access via getter or setter methods\nMost Kotlin developers put their annotations on properties, which Hibernate treats as field access by default.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nIn this example, it might look like the getter and setter methods will be called to access the name property. But that’s only the case for your business logic. Because we annotated the fields, the persistence provider will use reflection to access them directly, bypassing the getter and setter methods.\nAs a general best practice, it’s recommended to stick to field access. It’s easier to read and lets your persistence provider access the entity’s fields directly. You can then provide getter and setter methods that help your business code without affecting your database mapping.\nIf you want to use property access, you can either annotate your entity class with @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY) or annotate the accessors explicitly:\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nHowever, when you do this, you must ensure that all fields are defined as var. Kotlin doesn’t provide setter methods for fields defined as val.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String? = null \n}\nYou can see this when checking Kotlin’s decompiled bytecode of a snippet above.\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport kotlin.Metadata;\nimport org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;\n\n\n@Entity\n…\npublic final class Company {\n  @Nullable\n  private Long id;\n  @Nullable\n  private final String name;\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  @Nullable\n  public final Long getId() {\n     return this.id;\n  }\n\n  public final void setId(@Nullable Long var1) {\n     this.id = var1;\n  }\n\n  @Nullable\n  public final String getName() {\n     return this.name;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYour persistence provider will check that each field has a getter and a setter method. As long as you use var to define your entity fields, property access works with Kotlin.\nNull safety and default values\nNull safety and default values are two popular features in Kotlin that don’t exist in that form in Java. It’s no surprise that you have to pay special attention if you want to use them in your Jakarta Persistence entities.\nNullability considerations (including primary key fields)\nKotlin allows you to define whether a field or property supports null values. Unfortunately, reflection can bypass Kotlin’s null prevention, and as explained earlier, the persistence provider uses reflection to initialize your entity objects.\nEven if you define an entity attribute as non-nullable, your persistence provider will set it to null if the database contains a null value. In your business code, this can lead to runtime exceptions similar to those seen in Java.\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"user\")\nclass User(\n   @Id\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String\n)\n\nfun testLogic(){\n   // Suppose the row with id = 1 has name = NULL in the database\n   val user = userRepository.findById(1).get()\n   println(\"Firstname: ${user.name}\") // null, because Hibernate saves null via reflection\n}\nAnd unfortunately, solving this problem is not as easy as it seems.\nYou could argue that all non-nullable entity fields should map to a database column with a not-null constraint. So, your database can’t contain any null values.\nIn general, this is a great approach. But it does not eliminate the risk completely. Constraints can get out of sync between different environments or during migrations. Therefore, using not-null constraints on your database is highly recommended, but it doesn’t provide an unbreakable guarantee that you will never fetch a null value from the database.\nTo make it even worse, all Jakarta Persistence implementations call the no-argument constructor of your entity class to instantiate an object and then use reflection to initialize each field. This means that technically, all your entity fields must be nullable.\nWhat does that mean for your entities? Should you use val or var to model your fields?\nThat decision is ultimately up to you. Both of them work, but we recommend sticking to the Kotlin way: Use val if an entity field is not supposed to be changed by your business logic, and var otherwise. However, due to the issues discussed earlier, it is also essential to ensure that everyone on your team is aware that your Jakarta Persistence implementation may set those fields to null if your database lacks a not-null constraint.\n@Id and generated value\nThe previous paragraphs already discussed why all entity fields should be nullable. However, many developers consider primary key attributes to be distinct because the database requires a primary key value, and the Jakarta Persistence specification defines it as immutable. Primary keys are mandatory and immutable as soon as you persist the entity object in your database. But let’s quickly discuss why this doesn’t mean that primary key values should be not-nullable, especially if you’re using database-generated primary key values.\nWhen you want to store a new record in your database, you create a new entity object without a primary key and persist it. \nUnfortunately, the Jakarta Persistence specification doesn’t clearly define how to implement the persist operation. But it requires generating a primary key value if none is provided. The handling of provided primary key values differs across implementations, but that’s a topic for a different article. \nThe important thing here is that all persistence providers treat null as a not-provided primary key value. They then use a database sequence or an auto-incremented column to generate a primary key value and set it on the entity object. Due to this mechanism, the primary key value is null before the entity gets persisted, and changes during the persist operation.\nAn interesting side note is that Hibernate handles the primary key value 0 differently when calling the persist or the merge method. The persist method throws an exception because it expects the object to be an already-persisted entity. In contrast, Hibernate’s merge method generates a new primary key value and inserts a new record into the database. That’s why you can model a primary key with the default value 0 and save the new entity object using Spring Data JPA. The default repository implementation recognizes the already set primary key value and calls the merge method instead of the persist method.\nNow, returning to the initialization of primary key fields.\nWhen you fetch an entity object from the database, your persistence provider uses the parameterless constructor to instantiate a new object. It then uses reflection to set the primary key value before it returns the entity object to your business code.\nAll of this clearly shows that the Jakarta Persistence specification expects the primary key field to be mutable, even though the primary key value is not allowed to change after it was assigned. To avoid any portability issues across different Jakarta Persistence implementations, use null to represent an undefined primary key value.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n}\nDeclaring default values\nKotlin’s support for default values can simplify your business code and prevent null values. \n@Entity\nclass Company(\n   @Id @GeneratedValue \n   var id: Long? = null,\n\n   @NotNull\n   var name: String = \"John Doe\",\n\n   @Email\n   var email: String = \"default@email.com\"\n)\nHowever, please be aware that these default values will have no effect when your persistence provider fetches an entity object from the database.\nval companyFromDb = companyRepository.findById(1).get()\nprintln(companyFromDb.email) // <- If email in DB is empty, it will not set to \"default@email.com\"\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification requires a parameterless constructor that the implementations call when fetching an entity object from the database. After that, they use reflection to map all values retrieved from the database to the corresponding entity fields. As a result, the default values defined in your constructor will not be used, and some fields of your entity object might not be set even though you expect your constructor to assign default values. This may not cause any issues in your application, but it is something you and your team should be aware of.\nAnnotation placement\nIn Java, annotations are typically applied directly to the field, method, or class you annotate. In Kotlin, by contrast, annotations can target different elements, such as constructor parameters, properties, or fields.\nBefore Kotlin 2.2, this often caused problems because annotations applied to properties were applied only to the constructor parameter by default. This often caused problems for Jakarta Persistence and validation frameworks. Annotations like @NotNull, @Email, or even @Id didn’t end up where the framework expected them to be. This led to missed validations or mapping issues.\nThe good news is that this has been improved in Kotlin 2.2. With the new compiler option, which IntelliJ IDEA will suggest enabling, annotations will be applied to the constructor parameter and the property or field by default. So, your code now works as expected without requiring any changes.\nTo learn more, check out the blog post.\nIntelliJ IDEA to the rescue!\nIn the upcoming 2026.1 release, IntelliJ IDEA will provide inspections and quick-fixes to address many of the problems mentioned in this article, thereby improving your overall experience.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The IntelliJ Platform provides a powerful debugger framework that plugins can extend to support various programming languages and runtime environments. To enable remote development scenarios – where the IDE interface runs on your local machine while code executes on a remote server – we’ve redesigned the debugger architecture. This guide walks you through the changes and shows you how to migrate your plugin for 2026.1 and beyond.\nWhy split the debugger?\nIn the last several releases, we re‑architected the IntelliJ Platform debugger to support Remote Development mode. The major change visible to users is that the Debugger tool window and breakpoints are now rendered on the frontend, while the backend hosts the active debugger session and communicates with the target process. As a result, the debugger experience in Remote Development mode is much more responsive and stable. However, these changes have modified the debugger implementation and might affect existing plugins.\nTo provide the same experience in both Remote Development and Local IDE modes, we use a single implementation for both. Therefore, the changes described in this guide can affect plugins in both modes.\nImportant: This guide focuses primarily on plugin support in Local mode. For migration steps for Remote Development mode, see the section below.\nWhat’s changed?\nTo support Remote Development mode, we split the debugger into two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend is responsible for rendering the Debugger tool window (frames, variables’ tree, inlays, etc.). The backend hosts the active debugger session started by a plugin and provides data to the frontend via RPC (Remote Procedure Call).\nAs a result of these changes, several debugger API contracts have changed.\nThe debugger UI is now created asynchronously, so older methods that access the debugger UI or the Debugger tab may cause race conditions.\nThe frontend implementation no longer works directly with entities provided by plugins via XDebugProcess and XSuspendContext. For example, XStackFrame, XValue, and other instances are no longer available on the frontend. Instead, we use FrontendXValue wrappers that cannot be cast to plugin‑specific XValue implementations.\nExample: Suppose you have a plugin that implements a custom debugger. The plugin extends XDebugProcess as MyDebugProcess and provides custom implementations: MyStackFrame (which extends XStackFrame), MyValue (which extends XValue), and other entities. In addition to the backend implementation, the plugin provides an action that assumes the platform debugger UI operates on those entities directly (e.g. XValueNodeImpl contains MyValue).\nNow that the debugger has been split, the platform debugger UI operates with FrontendXValue and other frontend wrappers instead (e.g. XValueNodeImpl now contains FrontendXValue). As a result, actions operating on the debugger UI may unexpectedly access frontend entities and fail to cast them to plugin entities (e.g. FrontendXValue is not an instance of MyValue). See the following sections for more details.\nWhat should I do?\nTest your plugin with the 2026.1 EAP. UI components and actions are the areas most likely to be affected.\nPay attention to error messages in the IDE log. Incorrect debugger API usage will be logged with the [Split debugger] message prefix and an explanation of the migration steps.\nTwo migration paths:\nDepending on your plugin requirements, choose one of the following migration paths:\nLocal mode only – Migrate from the affected APIs below to the recommended ones. Your plugin will work in Local IDE mode, but some functionality may work incorrectly in Remote Development.\nLocal + Remote Development modes – Follow the Remote Development mode migration steps below to support both modes.\nIf you encounter unexpected API behavior, please report it in YouTrack.\nWhich APIs are affected in Local IDE mode?\nThe following APIs related to the debugger UI are deprecated and unsafe to use since 2026.1:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getRunContentDescriptor – deprecated and must not be used, as the frontend UI should not be accessed from the backend. See the Javadoc for more details.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI – deprecated and must not be used. Can lead to race conditions due to asynchronous creation of the frontend UI.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab (internal) – deprecated and must not be used. Can also lead to race conditions.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady.\nWhich APIs are safe to use in Local IDE mode?\nAll APIs that provide data to the backend are valid and safe to use in Local mode, such as XDebugProcess, XSuspendContext, and the data they provide.\nFor creating debugger‑related actions, the following APIs are supported:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.actions.handlers.XDebuggerActionHandler\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XDebuggerTreeActionBase\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XFetchValueActionBase\nThese actions should not require changes in Local IDE mode. They have been adapted to use plugin‑specific entities instead of frontend wrappers to preserve compatibility with the older implementation.\nRemote Development mode migration steps\nThe following APIs will NOT work in Remote Development mode:\nUI and Debugger tab access:\n\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady\nBase action classes that work with debugger nodes:\n\nXDebuggerTreeActionBase\nXFetchValueActionBase\nUse these alternatives instead:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter – use this to provide additional tabs in the Debugger tool window.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady – also works for adding tabs, but com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter is the recommended approach.\nXDebuggerTreeBackendOnlyActionBase – an alternative to XDebuggerTreeActionBase that works only with XValue instead of nodes.",

        "contentSnippet": "윈도11 최적화 팁 중에 LargeSystemCache와 DisablePagingExecutive가 있는데, 이건 옛날에나 쓰던 방식이고, SSD를 사용하는 최근 2010년 이후의 시스템에는 오히려 문제가 되기 때문에 쓰면 안되는 설정이다. 하지만 여러 곳에서 잘못된 정보가 유통되기에 이 글을 쓰게 되었다.\n \n1. 역사적 배경 (알아둬도 큰 쓸모는 없지만...)\nLargeSystemCache와 DisablePagingExecutive 설정은 과거 HDD라고 불리는 하드 디스크를 장착한 십수년전 시스템에서 사용되던 설정으로서, 커널이라고 불리는 시스템 코어 부분이 사용하는 메모리 영역을 큰 값으로 확보해서 시스템 영역을 메모리에 상주시키는 효과가 있었다. 그렇다면 왜 시스템 영역을 메모리에 상주되는 기능이 있는지 살펴봐야 한다. 이를 위해 우린 스왑 영역에 대해서 조금 알아둬야만한다.\n우선 램은 프로그램이 실행되기 위에서 디스크에 있는 정보를 읽어서 올려두는 주 메모리 공간(main memory)이다. 모든 프로그램은 램을 사용한다는 사실부터 기억해두자.\n2000년대 중반만 하더라도 인터넷 열풍으로 PC 시장이 빠르게 성장했는데, 그에 비해 메모리(RAM) 용량은 발전이 더뎌서 1GB정도 밖에 안되는 경우가 많았다. 2026년 기준으로 보면 PC의 램 최소사양이 8~16GB이고, 게임을 하는 사람은 보통 32GB를 쓰는 것에 비하면 1GB는 엄청 작은 값이었다. 따라서 Windows에서는 여러 프로그램을 원활하게 실행하기 위해 최대한 램을 아껴써야만 했다. 이를 위해 스왑 영역을 사용하는 기법이 도입되었는데, 이는 OS(운영체제)론을 배운 학생이라면 다 알것이다. 혹시나 모르는 사람을 위해 설명하자면, 운영체제가 메모리 부족을 해결하기 위해 디스크의 특정 영역에 메모리 공간의 일부를 이동(copy and remove)시켰다가 나중에 필요할때 다시 메모리로 가져오는 기법이다. 이렇게 하면 RAM이 1GB여도 2GB인 것처럼 뻥튀기를 할 수 있었다. 운영체제론에서는 이때 사용되는 디스크 공간을 스왑공간(swap space)이라고 부르는데, 윈도에서는 페이지 파일(pagefile) 이라고 다르게 부르며 실제 위치는 C:\\pagefile.sys 에 만들어지는 경우가 많다.[1]\n참고로 메모리의 영역을 pagefile로 이동시키는 과정을 스왑 아웃(swap out)이라고 부르고, 반대로 pagefile에서 RAM으로 이동하는 과정을 스왑 인(swap in)이라고 부른다. 아래 그림을 보면 이해가 쉬울 것이다.\nWindows, Swap Out, Swap In (Gemini 생성)\n\n\n그런데 스왑 아웃이나 스왑 인에는 심각한 문제가 있다. 그건 바로 딜레이가 발생한다는 점이다. 어떤 프로그램을 수행하려고 하는데, 필요한 램 공간이 500MB정도 부족하다고 가정하자. 그럼 운영체제는 최소 500MB 이상의 메모리를 확보하기 위해 메모리 일부분을 디스크로 복사하는 과정, 즉 swap out이 발생한다. 문제는 500MB이상의 데이터를 디스크로 복사하는 과정에서 심각한 딜레이가 발생한다는 점이다(당시 하드 디스크의 속도는 대체로 초당 50~100MB수준 이었다). 따라서 500MB이상의 메모리를 swap out하려면 최소 6~10초 정도는 딜레이가 생길 것이다. 그런데 프로그램 실행시 이 정도 딜레이가 발생하면 악영향을 줄 것이다. 그렇다면 딜레이를 줄이기 위해 어떤 방법이 있을까? 그건 바로 미리미리 복사하던지, 아니면 메모리를 비워서 빈 메모리 공간을 만들어두는 것이다.\n그런데 이렇게 미리 공간을 확보하는 것이 효과가 좋은 원인을 생각해보면 HDD(하드 디스크)의 복사 속도가 매우 느렸기 때문에 발생하는 딜레이였다. 그리고 공간을 확보하기 위해 디스크를 자주 쓰거나 읽게되면 디스크로부터 데이터를 주로 많이 읽어들이는 데이터베이스나 서버들은 악영향이 생긴다. 그래서 메모리를 미리 확보하는 기법은 반대로 커널의 응답속도가 떨어뜨리는 문제가 생긴다. 그래서 주변 장치를 많이 사용하거나 혹은 커널이 대용량 데이터를 처리하는 경우에 반대로 커널(시스템) 영역이 디스크로 swap out되지 않도록 하는 기능이 필요해진 것이었다. 이를 돕는 기능이 바로 LargeSystemCache, DisablePagingExecutive 라 부르는 것이었다. 두가지 기능에 대해서는 아래에 표로 정리해두었다.\n LargeSystemCache \n대용량 캐시를 사용하도록 하여, 커널이 파일을 읽거나 메모리 영역을 사용 할 때 캐싱을 최대한 하도록 하는 기법이다. 즉 빈 공간을 남기지 말고 최대한 파일을 위한 캐시로 쓰게 한다. 윈도 서버에서 데이터베이스나 네트워크 서비스를 사용할 때 반응 속도를 올리는데 도움이 되던 설정이다. 게임이나 문서 작업을 하는 일반인들에게는 필요가 없는 설정이다.[2]\n\n\n DisablePagingExecutive  \n커널이 사용하는 영역의 메모리나 디바이스 메모리를 swap out을 하지 않고 메인 메모리에 유지하도록 하는 것이다. 위와 마찬가지로 윈도 시스템의 반응 속도를 올려주는 장점이 있었다. 혹은 디바이스 장치를 개발하는 경우에 주로 사용한다. [3]\n\n\n\n \n이들은 위에 정리한대로 메인 메모리(RAM)를 소모해서 윈도 시스템 자체의 서비스와 장치들의 반응 속도를 올리는게 핵심 목적이므로 주소 Windows Server에서 사용되는 기능이었다. 물론 개인용 PC에서 사용하던 Windows 7 (2009년)이나 Windows 8 (2012년)에는 4GB이상의 메모리를 가지고 있고, HDD 디스크를 사용하던 경우에는 이 설정이 효과가 있는 경우가 많았었다. 문제는 2010년대 중반에는 SSD가 대거 보급되었고, 8GB이상의 대용량 메모리를 가진 시스템이 늘어나면서 해당 설정이 무의미해졌다는 점이다. 지금 대부분의 시스템들은 보통 16GB이상의 메모리를 가지고 있고, 고성능의 SSD를 가지고 있기에 전혀 쓸 이유가 없는 기능이다.\n호랑이 담배 피우던 시절에 쓰는 PC설정 (Gemini 생성)\n\n\n그럼에도 불구하고 이 설정을 하면 빨라진다는 호랑이 담배피던 시절 괴담이 늘어나고 있는데, Win10이나 Win11에서  LargeSystemCache나 DisablePagingExecutive 를 설정해봐야 효과도 없고, 도리어 시스템을 불안정하게 만드는 경우도 많다. 특히 랩탑(노트북)은 이 설정을 켜면 절전모드에서 깨어날때 문제가 생기거나 몇몇 블루투스나 와이파이 장치들이 문제를 일으키기도 한다. PC 데스크탑에서는 랩탑보다는 안정적이지만 간혹 USB 장치나 PCIe 장치가 문제를 일으킬 수도 있다. 따라서 현재는 쓰면 안되는 기능이다. 그러면 이 기능을 어떻게 켜고 끄는지 살펴보자.\n \n2. LargeSystemCache, DisablePagingExecutive  끄기\n혹시라도 이 설정을 켠 사람들은 아래 방법으로 끄면 된다. 먼저 regedit를 실행해서 레지스트리 편집을 시행한다.\nLargeSystemCache와 DisablePagingExecutive 설정\n\n\n여기서 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Memory Management 설정으로 이동하면 LargeSystemCache나 DisablePagingExecutive 설정이 보일 것이다. 이 값들은 on하는 것이 1이고, off하는 것이 0이다. 당연히 default값은 off인 0이다. 이 2가지 설정 값이 1이라면 0으로 수정하면 된다.\n \n혹시 이 값을 설정한 뒤에 페이징 파일(pagefile)을 0바이트로 설정했다면 원상복구하는 것을 추천한다. 원복을 위해서는 다음과 같이 sysdm.cpl 프로그램에 설정하는 것이 편하다. 먼저 Win + R 키를 누르면 나타나는 좌측 하단 입력창에 sysdm.cpl 을 타이핑해서 실행한다. 그리고 \"고급\" 탭에 \"성능\" 설정을 눌러서 \"성능 옵션\" 창을 띄운다. 여기서 다시 \"고급\" 탭으로 이동해서 \"가상 메모리\"의 변경 버튼을 누르면 아래 그림처럼 가상 메모리 설정을 볼 수 있다. 가상메모리 설정을 \"시스템이 관리하는 크기\"로 설정하면 원상복구가 된다. 간혹 가상메모리 크기를 고정값으로 \"사용자 지정 크기\" 로 16GB로 해두는게 좋다는 글도 있는데, 다 십수년전 옛날 설정 이야기다. 2026년 기준으로 보면 쓸데없는 설정이다.\nsysdm.cpl의 성능옵션, 가상 메모리 설정\n\n\n윈도10이나 윈도11은 옛날처럼 최적화 하는 기법이 대부분 작동하지 않는다. 오히려 요새 최적화 기법은 발열이 심각한 몇몇 랩탑의 CPU나 올인원 PC들의 CPU 성능을 80% 정도로 낮추는 기능이 유용하고, 알림을 꺼서 최적화 하는 정도만 제대로 쓸모가 있다. 그 외에는 그냥 디폴트 값을 쓰는게 좋다. 괜히 만져서 더 느려지거나 문제가 생길 수 있으니 주의하도록 하자.\n그러나 굳이 꼭 쓰고 싶다면 위에 레지스트리를 고쳐서 LargeSystemCache 정도만 쓰는 것을 추천한다. 간혹 엄청난 문서 파일들을 작업하거나 동영상 같은 것을 편집하는 경우에는 아주 조금 유용할 수는 있을 듯 하다.\n \n레퍼런스\n[1] 페이징 파일 소개, Microsoft Learn, https://learn.microsoft.com/ko-kr/troubleshoot/windows-client/performance/introduction-to-the-page-file?source=recommendations\n[2] LargeSystemCache에 대한 설명, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc784562(v=ws.10)\n[3] DisablePagingExecutive 에 대한 설명, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/wpr-command-line-options\n \n \n히스토리\n2026.01.23 문서를 처음으로 작성",

JPA가 제공하지 않는 세밀한 SQL 제어(예: Batch Insert, 특정 벤더 전용 구문 등)가 필요할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있습니다. SQLQueryFactory를 통해 JDBC 레벨의 기능을 Type-Safe하게 사용할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.\n구현 코드 예시#\nSQLQueryFactory를 사용하여 Batch Insert를 구현하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n@Service\nclass BatchInsertService(\n    private val dataSource: DataSource\n) {\n    @Transactional\n    fun executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(writers: List<Writer>): Long {\n        // 1. 테이블 메타데이터 정의\n        val writerTable = RelationalPathBase(Writer::class.java, \"writer\", null, \"writer\")\n        // 2.

VALUES (...), (...), (...) 형태의 Multi-Value Insert 구문으로 재작성(Rewrite)하여 전송합니다. 이를 통해 네트워크 패킷 수를 획기적으로 줄이고 데이터베이스의 파싱 비용을 절감하여 성능을 극대화할 수 있습니다.\n성능 비교#\n성능 측정 코드#\n정확한 성능 측정을 위해 saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch의 실행 시간을 각각 측정했습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n\n    @Test\nfun `saveAll test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            writerRepository.saveAll(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 saveAll 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n@Test\nfun `executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            batchInsertService.executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 QueryDSL Batch Insert 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n\n측정 방식 설명\n\n반복 측정: 각 데이터 구간(100건 ~ 10,000건)마다 총 5회 반복하여 측정했습니다.\nWarm-up 고려: 테스트 실행 시 첫 번째 회차는 결과에서 제외했습니다. 이는 데이터베이스 커넥션 풀(Connection Pool)에서 커넥션을 처음 생성하는 초기 비용 등 초기화 작업에 소요되는 시간이 포함되어 결과가 왜곡되는 것을 방지하기 위함입니다.\n평균값 산출: 첫 회차를 제외한 나머지 4회의 실행 시간을 합산하여 평균값을 산출함으로써 보다 신뢰성 있는 성능 데이터를 얻었습니다.\n\n성능 측정 결과#\n\nJPA saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch를 사용했을 때의 성능 차이를 비교한 결과입니다. 데이터 개수가 늘어날수록 성능 차이가 확연하게 벌어지는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\nrowssaveAll (ms)add batch (ms)성능 개선율\n\n1001041288.50%\n200174.51690.80%\n500370.2527.592.60%\n1,0006955691.90%\n2,0001,5746895.70%\n5,0003,77814096.30%\n10,0007,50526596.50%\n\n\nsaveAll: JPA Repository의 saveAll 메서드 사용\nadd batch: QueryDSL SQLQueryFactory의 addBatch 사용\n\n10,000건 기준으로 약 96.5%의 성능 개선 효과가 있었습니다. saveAll이 약 7.5초 걸리는 작업을 Batch Insert로는 0.26초 만에 처리할 수 있습니다.\n결론#\n대량의 데이터를 처리해야 하는 배치성 작업이나 초기 데이터 적재 시에는 JPA의 saveAll보다는 JDBC Batch Insert를 사용하는 것이 필수적입니다.\n특히, 오직 Batch Insert 성능 개선만을 위해 Exposed와 같은 새로운 ORM을 도입하는 것은 프로젝트의 복잡도를 높일 수 있습니다. 이미 JPA와 QueryDSL을 사용 중인 환경이라면, QueryDSL-SQL을 활용하는 것이 추가적인 학습 곡선이나 설정의 번거로움 없이 Type-Safe하게 성능을 극대화할 수 있는 가장 효율적인 대안입니다.\n프로젝트에서 대량 Insert가 필요한 구간이 있다면, 별도의 라이브러리 추가 없이 QueryDSL-SQL을 통해 성능과 생산성을 동시에 챙겨보시기를 권장합니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "이더넷 케이블, 겉모습은 다 같아 보이지만 사실은 색상별로 숨겨진 의미가 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 흔히 성능이나 속도를 나타낸다고 오해하기 쉽지만, 이 색상 코드에는 우리가 미처 몰랐던 진짜 활용법과 네트워크 관리의 비밀이 숨어있습니다. 오늘은 이더넷 케이블의 외부 재킷 색상부터 내부 전선의 복잡한 색상 코드까지, 그 흥미로운 세계를 함께 탐험해볼까 합니다. 과연 색상들이 어떤 역할을 하는지, 또 어떤 점에 주의해야 하는지 최신 정보를 바탕으로 자세히 알아볼게요!\n\n\n이더넷 케이블 외부 색상, 그 진짜 의미는?  \n음, 우리가 흔히 보는 이더넷 케이블들, 그냥 다 똑같이 생겼다고 생각하셨을 거예요. 파란색, 노란색, 빨간색, 초록색, 회색 심지어 분홍색까지 다양하게 있긴 하지만, 사실 그냥 예쁘라고 만든 건 아니거든요. 많은 분들이 USB 포트 색깔처럼 속도나 성능을 나타내는 게 아닐까 오해하시곤 하는데, 그건 정말 아니에요. 이 케이블 색상들은 단순히 시각적인 요소도 아니고, 성능과도 전혀 무관하답니다.\n그렇다면 왜 이렇게 다양한 색깔이 존재할까요? 바로 \"조직화\"와 \"명확성\" 때문입니다. 상상해보세요. 복잡한 데이터 센터나 사무실에서 수백 가닥의 케이블이 얽혀있는 모습을요. 그때 특정 색깔의 케이블이 어떤 용도로 쓰이는지 한눈에 파악할 수 있다면 얼마나 편리할까요?\n  잠깐! 여기서 말하는 색상 코드는 케이블 외부 재킷의 색깔을 의미합니다. 케이블 내부에 꼬여있는 전선들의 색상 코드는 연결성과 신호 전송에 매우 중요한 역할을 하는데, 이건 나중에 따로 자세히 이야기해 드릴게요. 착각하시면 안 돼요!\n대규모 네트워크 환경에서는 말할 것도 없고요, 집에서도 유용해요. 여러분의 라우터, 스위치, 모뎀 연결에 각기 다른 색상의 케이블을 사용하면, 갑자기 네트워크가 안 될 때 문제의 원인을 훨씬 쉽게 찾아낼 수 있답니다. 정말 작은 차이 같지만, 실제로 써보면 엄청난 편리함을 가져다주죠.\n이 외에도 제조사들은 케이블 카테고리(예: Cat 5, Cat 6, Cat 7)를 구분하거나, 케이블 길이, 심지어는 설치 연도(예: 2025년 설치는 파란색, 2026년 설치는 노란색)를 나타내는 데 색상을 활용하기도 합니다. 결국, 케이블 색상은 작업과 유지보수를 더 빠르고 덜 헷갈리게 만드는 데 큰 도움을 준다고 볼 수 있어요. 성능에 영향을 주진 않지만, 네트워크 관리의 효율성에는 지대한 영향을 끼치는 거죠.\n주요 색상별 용도, 과연 정해진 규칙이 있을까?  \n자, 그렇다면 각 색상들이 정확히 어떤 의미를 가지고 있을까요? 음… 사실은 정해진 \"만국 공통\" 표준은 없어요. 이 점이 좀 중요합니다. 케이블 색상의 의미는 특정 조직, 공급업체 또는 설치자가 어떻게 사용하기로 결정했는지에 따라 전적으로 달라질 수 있어요. 하지만 제가 겪어본 바로는, 몇 가지 흔한 패턴은 분명히 존재합니다.\n  파란색: 대부분 표준 네트워크 연결에 사용돼요. 데스크톱 컴퓨터, 노트북 독, 사무실 프린터 등을 네트워크 스위치나 라우터에 연결할 때 말이죠. 가장 보편적이죠!\n  노란색: PoE(Power over Ethernet) 장치에 자주 사용됩니다. IP 보안 카메라, VoIP 전화, 무선 액세스 포인트처럼 케이블 자체에서 전력을 공급받는 장치들이요.\n⬛ 검은색 또는 회색: 사무실이나 가정에서 일상적인 연결에 많이 쓰입니다. 라우터를 모뎀에 연결하거나, 게임 콘솔을 네트워크 스위치에 연결하는 경우처럼요. 저도 집에서 주로 회색 케이블을 쓰고 있어요.\n  빨간색: 이건 정말 중요한 연결에만 사용되는 경우가 많습니다. 서버, 방화벽, 비상 백업 시스템처럼 절대로 연결이 끊기면 안 되는 곳에요. 때로는 제한되거나 보안이 강화된 네트워크 구간을 나타내기도 해요.\n  녹색: 크로스오버 연결(두 개의 유사한 장치를 직접 연결할 때, 예: 스위치-스위치 또는 컴퓨터-컴퓨터)이나 스마트 온도 조절기, 빌딩 제어 시스템 같은 환경 시스템에 사용되기도 합니다.\n  주황색 또는   보라색: 비교적 드물지만, 테스트 환경, 외부 연결, 게스트나 계약자를 위한 VLAN 세그먼트와 같은 특별한 네트워크 기능에 사용될 수 있어요.\n\n\n⚠️ 경고! 다시 한번 강조하지만, 위에 설명된 색상별 의미는 보편적인 표준이 아닙니다. 색상이 어떤 용도를 암시할 수는 있지만, 중요한 장비를 연결하거나 제거하기 전에는 반드시 해당 케이블의 문서나 네트워크 관리자에게 확인하는 것이 가장 안전합니다. 실수가 발생하면 큰 문제를 초래할 수 있으니까요.\n케이블 성능? 색상 대신 '카테고리'에 주목하세요!  \n가장 중요한 포인트 중 하나인데요, 케이블 재킷의 색상은 해당 케이블의 실제 성능과는 전혀 무관하다는 것입니다. 이더넷 케이블은 '카테고리'로 분류되며, 각 카테고리는 특정 속도와 대역폭을 위해 설계되었어요.\n예를 들어볼까요?\nCat 5e는 최대 1Gbps의 속도를 지원하고요,\nCat 6a는 더 긴 거리에서 최대 10Gbps까지 처리할 수 있습니다.\nCat 8은 대역폭의 헤비급 선수라고 할 수 있는데, 데이터 센터용으로 제작되어 짧은 거리에서는 최대 40Gbps까지 도달할 수 있어요. 정말 엄청난 속도죠!\n그러니까, 화려한 분홍색 Cat 6 케이블이 칙칙한 회색 Cat 5e 케이블보다 훨씬 뛰어난 성능을 발휘할 수 있다는 이야기예요. 중요한 것은 케이블 옆면에 인쇄된 '카테고리 등급'이지, 겉으로 보이는 색상이 아니라는 점을 꼭 기억해주세요. 이 카테고리는 단순히 속도뿐만 아니라, 전기적 간섭으로부터 케이블을 얼마나 잘 보호하는지, 그리고 안정적이고 신뢰할 수 있는 연결을 얼마나 잘 유지하는지까지 정의한답니다.\n이 때문에 오래된 Cat 5 케이블을 Cat 6 또는 Cat 6a로 업그레이드하면 현대 네트워크 환경에서 확연한 성능 차이를 느낄 수 있어요. 제 경험상, 특히 고화질 스트리밍이나 대용량 파일 전송이 잦다면 체감 효과가 상당합니다.\n\n\n내부 전선 색상 코드는 왜 중요할까?  \n외부 재킷 색깔 이야기는 이제 충분히 한 것 같고, 그럼 이제 케이블 '내부' 전선들의 색상 코드로 넘어가 볼까요? 사실 여기가 진짜 중요합니다. 외부 색상이 그저 \"편의\"를 위한 것이었다면, 내부 전선의 색상 코드는 이더넷 케이블이 제대로 작동하기 위한 \"필수\" 요소예요.\n이 내부 전선 색상 코드는 크게 두 가지 국제 표준으로 나뉘어요: T568A와 T568B입니다. 이 두 가지 표준은 8개의 내부 전선(4쌍의 꼬임선)을 RJ45 커넥터의 핀에 어떤 순서로 연결할지를 정의합니다. 이 순서가 틀어지면 네트워크 연결이 아예 안 되거나, 불안정해지죠.\n대부분의 상업용 및 주거용 건물에서는 T568B 표준을 사용하는 경우가 많지만, 오래된 건물이나 특정 환경에서는 T568A를 쓰기도 합니다. 중요한 건, 양쪽 끝 커넥터의 배열이 같아야 스트레이트(Straight-through) 케이블이 되고, 한쪽은 T568A, 다른 한쪽은 T568B로 배열해야 크로스오버(Crossover) 케이블이 된다는 점이에요. 크로스오버 케이블은 스위치 없이 두 대의 컴퓨터를 직접 연결하는 등 특정 상황에서만 사용됩니다.\n핀 번호\nT568A 색상\nT568B 색상\n\n\n\n\n1\n흰-녹\n흰-주\n\n\n2\n녹\n주\n\n\n3\n흰-주\n흰-녹\n\n\n4\n파\n파\n\n\n5\n흰-파\n흰-파\n\n\n6\n주\n녹\n\n\n7\n흰-갈\n흰-갈\n\n\n8\n갈\n갈\n\n\n\n아, 그리고 잊지 말아야 할 게 하나 더 있어요. 내부 전선은 모두 꼬여있다는 사실입니다. 이렇게 꼬여있는 형태는 외부 간섭으로부터 신호 손실을 최소화하고 안정적인 통신을 가능하게 해요. 그래서 \"꼬임쌍선(Twisted Pair)\" 케이블이라고 불리는 거고요. 혹시 직접 이더넷 케이블을 만드실 기회가 있다면, 이 내부 색상 코드를 정말 정말 신중하게 맞춰야 합니다. 잘못 연결하면 정말 곤란해지거든요!\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 외부 색상은 성능과 무관: 이더넷 케이블의 외부 재킷 색상은 속도나 성능이 아닌, 주로 '조직화'와 '식별'을 위한 도구입니다.\n✅ 정해진 표준은 없음: 외부 색상에 대한 보편적인 국제 표준은 없으며, 사용자의 재량이나 특정 조직의 규칙에 따라 의미가 달라질 수 있습니다.\n✅ 성능은 '카테고리'가 결정: 케이블의 실제 성능(속도, 대역폭, 안정성)은 Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 8과 같은 '카테고리 등급'에 의해 결정됩니다. 구매 시 반드시 이를 확인해야 해요.\n✅ 내부 색상 코드는 필수: 케이블 내부의 꼬임쌍선 색상 코드(T568A/B)는 RJ45 커넥터 연결에 필수적이며, 네트워크 연결 안정성에 직접적인 영향을 미칩니다.\n이더넷 케이블 선택과 사용에 있어 색상이 주는 시각적 정보는 분명 도움이 되지만, 그 본질적인 역할과 성능 기준을 정확히 이해하는 것이 중요합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 이더넷 케이블 색깔이 다르면 속도도 다른가요?\nA1: 아니요, 이더넷 케이블의 외부 색상은 데이터 전송 속도나 성능과는 전혀 무관합니다. 색상은 주로 네트워크 관리의 편의를 위해 케이블의 용도를 구분하는 데 사용됩니다. 실제 속도와 성능은 'Cat(카테고리)' 등급(예: Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 8)에 따라 결정됩니다.\nQ2: T568A와 T568B는 무엇이며, 왜 중요한가요?\nA2: T568A와 T568B는 이더넷 케이블 내부 꼬임쌍선의 RJ45 커넥터 연결 배열을 정의하는 두 가지 국제 표준입니다. 이 표준에 따라 정확하게 연결해야 데이터 신호가 올바르게 전송되고 안정적인 네트워크 연결이 가능합니다. 이 배열이 잘못되면 통신이 불가능해지거나 불안정해질 수 있습니다.\nQ3: 집에서 이더넷 케이블을 고를 때 어떤 점을 봐야 하나요?\nA3: 집에서 사용할 케이블을 고를 때는 외부 색상보다는 케이블의 '카테고리' 등급을 확인하는 것이 가장 중요합니다. 연결하려는 장비와 인터넷 속도에 맞춰 적절한 카테고리(예: 기가비트 인터넷에는 Cat 5e 이상, 더 높은 성능을 원하면 Cat 6 이상)를 선택하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ4: 오래된 Cat 5 케이블을 Cat 6로 바꾸면 효과가 있을까요?\nA4: 네, 상당한 효과를 볼 수 있습니다.

AI가 저의 취향에 딱 맞는 콘텐츠만 쏙쏙 골라주니, 시간을 절약할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 매번 만족스러운 시청 경험을 할 수 있게 되는 거죠. 서비스 제공자 입장에서는 사용자가 플랫폼에 더 오래 머물고, 재결제할 확률이 높아지니 서로 윈-윈이 되는 효과라고 볼 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  AI, 생각보다 훨씬 더 우리의 삶에 스며들었네요\n스마트 비서, 챗봇, 스트리밍 추천 외에도 AI는 정말 다양한 방식으로 우리의 삶을 풍요롭게 하고 있습니다. 스마트폰 카메라의 얼굴 인식 기능, 은행 앱의 이상 금융 거래 감지, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 맞춤형 상품 추천, 심지어는 차량 내비게이션의 실시간 교통 분석까지, 우리가 인지하지 못하는 사이에도 AI는 조용히, 그러나 강력하게 작동하고 있어요.\n물론, AI 기술의 발전이 항상 장밋빛 미래만을 의미하는 것은 아닙니다. 개인 정보 보호나 데이터 오남용, 딥페이크와 같은 윤리적인 문제들은 우리가 계속해서 논의하고 해결해나가야 할 숙제임은 분명해요. 하지만 이러한 우려에도 불구하고, AI가 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 긍정적인 측면이 훨씬 더 많다는 것을 부정하기는 어렵습니다.\n솔직히 처음에는 저도 AI가 너무 어렵고, '거대한 기술'이라고만 생각했어요. 하지만 이렇게 매일매일 사용하는 기술들을 되짚어보니, AI는 우리의 삶을 '더 쉽게' 만들어주는 '친근한 도구'라는 사실을 깨달았습니다. 미래의 AI는 또 어떤 모습으로 우리를 놀라게 할지, 정말 기대되지 않나요?\n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI는 스마트 비서처럼 이미 우리 일상에 깊이 스며들어 있습니다.\n✅ 챗봇은 정보 탐색을 넘어 창의적인 아이디어와 시각적 자료까지 제공합니다.\n✅ 스트리밍 서비스 추천은 AI가 우리의 취향을 섬세하게 분석한 결과입니다.\n✅ AI는 우리 삶을 더 편리하고 효율적으로 만드는 '친근한 도구'입니다.\nAI는 우리의 생각보다 훨씬 가까이에 있습니다. 조금만 관심을 가지면 AI의 놀라운 잠재력을 더욱 효과적으로 활용할 수 있을 거예요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\nA1: 네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\nQ2: AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\nA2: 개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\nQ3: 미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\nA3: 2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\n\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"제가 매일 사용하는 것 중에 AI가 적용된 예시가 또 있을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 아주 많습니다! 스마트폰의 얼굴 인식 잠금 해제, 지도 앱의 최적 경로 안내, 온라인 쇼핑몰의 개인 맞춤 광고, 은행 앱의 사기 거래 탐지, 심지어는 이메일 스팸 필터링까지 모두 AI 기술이 적용된 예시입니다. 이처럼 AI는 우리 삶의 거의 모든 디지털 접점에서 활동하고 있어요.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"AI가 이렇게 일상에 스며들면 혹시 개인 정보는 안전한가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"개인 정보 보호는 AI 시대의 중요한 과제 중 하나입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스 제공 기업들은 암호화, 익명화 등의 기술로 데이터를 보호하고 있지만, 사용자 스스로도 불필요한 정보 제공을 줄이고, 서비스 약관을 꼼꼼히 확인하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요합니다. 정부와 기업들도 AI 윤리 및 개인 정보 보호를 위한 법규와 가이드라인을 강화하고 있습니다.\"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"미래에는 AI가 어디까지 발전할 것이라고 예상하나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"2026년 현재를 기준으로 볼 때, AI는 더욱 개인화되고 맞춤화된 서비스로 발전할 것으로 예상됩니다. 예를 들어, 개인의 건강 데이터를 분석하여 맞춤형 식단이나 운동 프로그램을 제안하고, 교육 분야에서는 개개인의 학습 속도에 맞는 맞춤형 학습 콘텐츠를 제공하는 등 더욱 밀접하게 우리 삶의 질을 향상시키는 방향으로 진화할 것입니다. 또한, 자율주행, 로봇 공학 등 다양한 산업 분야에서 혁신을 가속화할 것으로 보입니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "본인이 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피이거나, 또는 주변에 이렇게 얼굴이 두꺼운 철면피 친구와 지인이 항상 몇 명씩 누구나 있을 것이다. 철면피는 말 그대로 얼굴이 두꺼워서 남의 비판을 신경 쓰지 않는 뻔뻔한 사람을 뜻하는데, ‘얼굴에 철판을 깔았다’라는 말도 우리는 자주 사용한다. 이 말은 어떻게, 언제 쓰이냐에 따라 긍정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있고, 부정적인 의미를 가질 수도 있는데, 오늘은 아주 긍정적인 의미에서의 철면피에 대해서 이야기해 보려고 한다.\n얼마 전에 미국의 슈퍼 어디에서나 볼 수 있는 저당 간식 스키니딥드(SkinnyDipped)의 창업 이야기를 팟캐스트로 들었다. 초코 코팅 아몬드인데, 주로 다크초콜릿을 사용하고 코팅을 아주 얇게 해서 다른 간식보다 당과 열량이 낮은 제품인데, 모든 창업 이야기가 웬만한 TV 드라마보다 드라마틱하듯이, 이 회사의 이야기도 너무 재미있었다. 이 회사의 창업 초기에는 내가 다른 스타트업의 창업 초기에서도 항상 발견하는 공통점이 있었는데, 바로 창업가들의 철면피와 뻔뻔스러움이다. 엄마와 딸이 창업한 회사인데 제품을 오프라인 유통업체에 입점시키기 위해서 초반에는 두 분이 별의별 짓을 다 했다. 일단 Whole Foods 입점을 위해 간식 담당자를 만나기 위해서 매일 매장에서 하염없이 기다린 이야기도 있고(우리가 투자한 회사의 대표도 실제로 이렇게 한 적이 있는데, 이건 요새도 잘 먹히는 방법이다.), 더 재미있었던 에피소드는 회사의 본사가 있던 시애틀의 구글 건물에 몰래 들어가서, 구내식당에서 어슬렁거리면서 쉐프를 찾았고, 스키니딥드 제품을 구글 직원들에게 간식으로 제공해야 한다고 설득한 이야기다.\n이런 두꺼운 낯짝으로 고객사, 투자사, 협력사에 쳐들어가는 건 내가 아는 매우 많은 창업가가 창업 초기에 했던할 수밖에 없었던 공통된 필수 코스인데, 실제로 사업을 하다 보면 누구나 다 이렇게 해야 하는 시점이 있다. 그리고 정말 성공하고 싶다면 모든 창업가들이 이렇게 철면피를 깔고, 일반인들은 쪽팔려서 절대로 하지 못하는, 그런 일들을 해야 한다.\n나도 오래전에 영업하면서 철면피 영업을 했었고, 뮤직쉐이크를 하면서도 여러 번 이런 경험이 있고, 스트롱을 처음 시작할 때도 그냥 여기저기 쳐들어가서 달성하고자 하는 일을 시도해 본 적이 있다. 모든 쳐들어감이 성공하진 못했고, 어떤 경우에는 철면피가 찢어지기도 했지만, 어쨌든 나는 정말 간절했고, 그 간절함이 당시에 이런 두꺼운 낯짝을 형성해 준 것 같다.\n나도 이런 경험을 직접 해봤기 때문에 우리 투자사 대표님들에게도 가끔 이렇게 해야 한다고 하는데, 많은 분들이 “저는 그런 거 원래 못해요” , “뭐, 그렇게까지 해야 하나요?”라는 말을 한다. 나는 “네, 그렇게까지 해야 합니다.”라고 하지만, 실제로 철면피를 깔고 행동할 수 있는 분들은 그렇게 많지 않다.\n그런데 이분들이 잘 모르는 사실이 하나 있다. 위에서 말한 스키니딥드 창업가나 과거의 나 같은 사람도 태어날 때부터 쪽팔림을 모르고, 남의 시선을 신경 쓰지 않고, 철면피였던 건 아니다. 이들도 당연히 안 만나주려고 하는 사람들의 사무실에 불쑥 쳐들어가거나, 누가 건물의 출입구를 열어주기를 하염없이 추위에서 기다리거나, 안 사겠다고 하는 잠재 고객사 대표의 새벽 출근길 자가용의 문을 기사님 대신 매일 열어주고 인사하는 짓을 너무너무 즐겁고 기쁘게 하진 않을 것이다. 이들에게도 아주 창피하고, 자존심 상하고, 하기 싫은 일이지만, 해야 하니까 하는 것이다.\n모든 창업가에겐 어느 정도의 철면피가 꼭 필요하다고 나는 생각한다. 이들이 회사를 처음 창업하고, 회사가 어느 정도 궤도에 올라가기 전까지는 대부분 투자자들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 협력업체들이 협업하고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람이고, 좋은 잠재 임직원분들이 만나고 싶지 않거나 관심 없는 사람인데, 나를 만나기 싫거나 나에게 관심이 없는 사람과 만나서 이야기할 수 있는 유일한 방법은 그냥 얼굴에 철판 깔고 쳐들어가는 것이다. 아주 힘들고, 아주 쪽팔리고, 아주 자존심 상하고, 굳이 이렇게까지 해야 하나 생각이 드는, 그런 행동이지만, 사업을 하기 위해서는 필요한 일이다. 왜냐하면, 이렇게 무리수를 둬서 일단 만나면 그 이후에 안 될 일도 되는 것을 나는 직접 경험해봤고, 여러 번 옆에서 목격했기 때문이다.\n다시 한번 강조한다. 그 누구도 철면피를 갖고 태어나진 않았다. 꼭 필요하고, 꼭 해야 하니까 낯짝을 두껍게 만든 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나는 개인적으로 학생 창업가를 좋아하고, 이들이 창업하는 걸 적극적으로 추천하고 응원한다. 우리가 학생 창업가에게만 전문적으로 투자하거나 이들에게만 투자하는 펀드가 있는 건 아니지만, 스트롱은 지금까지 꾸준히 대학생 창업팀에 투자하고 있고 이들이 하는 몇 개의 이벤트를 후원하고 있다. 그리고 우린 모두 다 바빠서 외부 강연이나 발표는 거의 안, 못 하고 있는데, 학생들 대상의 강연이나 발표, 또는 해커톤 심사는 웬만하면 시간을 만들어서 참석하고 있다. 창업가들의 나이는 점점 더 낮아지고 있는데, 우리가 지향하는 첫 번째 기관투자자가 되기 위해서는 이제는 학생들에게 투자해야 하기 때문이다. 결국 이 학생들은 스트롱의 미래의 고객이기 때문에 우리가 학생들 대상으로 하는 모든 활동은 잠재 고객에 대한 영업/마케팅 활동이라고 봐도 무방하다. 이들이 지금 또는 나중에 창업할 때, 가장 먼저 생각나는 VC가 스트롱벤처스가 되는 게 우리의 목표다.\n내가 스트롱을 시작한 2012년만 해도 학생들은 창업을 거의 하지 않았다. 창업이 뭔지도 몰랐고, 어떻게 하는지도 몰랐고, 이들에게 투자해 주는 VC도 없었다. 창업은 취업하지 못하면 어쩔 수 없이 선택해야 하는 마지막 옵션이었기 때문에 내가 당시에 만났던 학생 창업가들은 준비도 안 됐고, 실력도 없었다. 실은, 아직도 대부분의 학부생이나 대학원생들은 취업을 선호하긴 하지만, 요샌 창업을 1순위로 생각하는 학생들이 점점 더 많아지고 있다는 게 내 개인적인 생각이다.\n요새도 우린 더 많은 학생 창업가를 만나기 위한 방법에 대해서 고민하고 있는데, 혹시 이 글을 읽는 학생분들 중 좋은 방법이 있다면 언제든지 제안해 주시면 좋겠다.\n이미 창업했거나, 창업을 생각하는 학생들에게 내가 몇 가지 해주고 싶은 조언이 있다. 꼭 이렇게 하라는 건 아니지만, 창업하기 전에 충분히 생각해 봐야 하는 주제들이고, 몇 개는 나중에 회사가 켜졌을 때 이 회사를 완전히 망가뜨릴 수 있는 중요한 내용이라고 생각한다.\n일단 가장 첫 번째 조언은, 사업은 학교 과제가 아니라는 것이다. 내가 만나는 많은 학생 창업가는 실은 학생 창업가가 아니라 그냥 창업 과제를 하는 학생이다. 이들은 사업할 준비가 전혀 되지 않았고, 그냥 학업 외 재미있는 일을 하고 싶고, 멀리서 다른 창업가를 보니까 본인들도 할 수 있을 것 같다는 생각으로 법인설립하고 대표이사 명함 만들고, 코파운더 명함 만들면서 여기저기 기웃거리는 수준의 활동을 하고 있다. 어떤 분은 소위 말하는 스타트업 대표이사 놀이에 빠져있고, 졸업하고 대기업에 취직하는 게 목적인데, 이력서에 “ABC 창업 경험” 한 줄 달기 위해서 창업을 하는 경우도 있었다. 이렇게 하다 보니, 당연히 사업을 풀타임으로 안 한다. 학업을 하면서 사업을 병행하는데, 이렇게 대충대충, 건성건성 해서 제대로 된 사업을 만들 수 있다면, 우리가 14년 동안 투자한 290개의 회사는 모두 다 유니콘이 돼야 했다.\n그래서 내가 학생 창업가에게 가장 먼저 드리고 싶은 조언은, 정말로 제대로 사업을 하려면 일단 그 마음가짐부터 제대로 가지고, 이를 실제로 행동에 옮기려면 학업을 휴학하거나, 아니면 자퇴하라는 것이다. 이렇게 하지 않고서는 절대로 제대로 사업을 할 수가 없다. 너무 이진법적인 생각 같지만, 창업은 all in or nothing이다.\n두 번째 조언은, 교수님의 말을 맹신하지 말라는 것이다. 그리고 되도록 창업하는 회사의 주주명부에서 교수님은 빼거나, 아니면 이들의 지분을 2% 이하로 낮추라는 조언을 드리고 싶다. 내가 만나는 대부분의 학생 창업 스타트업은, 그리고 특히 지도교수가 있는 대학원생이 창업한 스타트업의 창업팀에는 지도교수가 들어가 있다. 그리고 대부분의 경우 이들은 30% 이상의 지분을 보유하고 있다. 이게 왜 틀렸는지는 내가 전에 이 글에서 대략 설명했는데, 다시 한번 간략하게 요약하자면, 스타트업의 코파운더는 1년 365일 하루 24시간 이 사업 생각만 해야 하고, 이 사업에 그 무엇보다 높은 우선순위를 둬야 한다. 교수들은 이게 구조적으로 안 된다. 왜냐하면 학교가 이들의 직장이라서 항상 학교가 이들의 우선순위이기 때문이다. 나는 회사가 잘 되면 가장 고생하고 기여를 많이 한 사람들이 가장 많은 돈을 벌어야 한다고 생각하는데 지분이 이걸 결정한다. 회사가 안 되면 역시 지분이 가장 많은 분들이 모든 책임과 비난을 받아야 한다. 하지만, 이 회사에 all in 하지 않고, 시간이 날 때마다 와서 파트타임으로 조언과 훈수를 하는 교수들이 지분을 이렇게 많이 보유하는 건 확실히 불공평하다고 생각한다. 어떤 교수들은 학교에서 가르치고, 본인이 창업한 회사가 있고, 지도하는 학생들이 창업한 3~4개 회사의 높은 지분을 보유한 C 레벨 임원으로 활동하고 있는데, 이런 구조로 회사가 나중에 투자받고, 좋은 사람을 채용하고, 잘 되는 건 쉽지 않다.\n그래서 되도록 교수는 창업팀에서 빼라. 꼭 이들의 조언이나 도움이 필요하다면 스톡옵션을 0.5% 이하로 주고 고문으로 모시는 걸 권장한다. 전에 어떤 학생 대표에게 이런 이야기를 하니까 굉장히 곤란해하면서 나에게 다음과 같은 말을 했다. 본인도 졸업해야 하는데, 지도교수님이 승인하지 않으면 졸업을 못 하므로 이런 껄끄러운 대화를 하는 게 너무 힘들다고. 그래서 내가 위에서 말한 대로 진짜로 사업을 하려면 그냥 학업을 중단하는 게 이런 졸업의 고민으로부터 자유로워질 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법이다. 아니면, 교수님과 이 힘든 대화를 해서 쇼부를 봐야 한다. 사업하면 이보다 훨씬 더 어려운 대화를 많이 해야 하고 훨씬 더 힘든 결정을 많이 해야 하는데, 여기서부터 막힌다면 사업 못 한다.\n마지막 조언은, 스타트업은 돈을 버는 사업을 만드는 곳이지, 그 누구도 따라 할 수 없는 기술을 개발하는 조직이 아니라는 점이다. 본인이 현재 개발하고 연구하는 분야가 세계 최고 수준이라면 이건 정말 대단하고 축하할만하다. 하지만, 그렇다고 이게 세계 최고의 사업이 된다는 보장은 없다. 아니, 그렇게 되는 경우는 거의 없다. 그럼, 노벨상 받은 모든 이론과 기술이 유니콘 사업이 돼야 한다. 기술은 그냥 단지 기술일 뿐이다. 이 기술을 기반으로 비즈니스 모델을 만들고, 더 나아가서는 돈을 버는 사업으로 진화시키는 건 완전히 다른 일이다. 연구보다 사업이 더 어렵다는 말이 아니다. 그냥 완전히 다르다는 말이다.\n우리 같은 VC는 기술에 투자하지 않는다. 그 기술로 만드는 돈을 버는 사업에 투자한다. 이걸 명확하게 이해해야 한다. \n나는 젊고, 똑똑하고, 에너지 넘치는 학생 창업가를 정말 좋아한다. 이들이 맘먹고 사고 치면 유니콘이 아니라 데카콘 몇 마리 만들 수 있다고 믿는다. 나는 더 많은 학생이 창업해야 한다고 생각한다. 특히, 위에서 말한 내용에 대해서 충분히 고민해 본 학생 창업가들이라면 언제든지 스트롱에 연락해 주시길.",

《사하촌》 중, 1936\n김정한의 소설 《사하촌》을 보면 일제강점기 소작제도의 현실이 얼마나 고단했는지가 잘 묘사된다. 풍년이면 쌀값이 싸져서 돈을 못벌고, 흉년이면 내다 팔 쌀이 없어서 돈을 못벌었다. 조선 후기 민중들의 삶은 팍팍하기 그지없었다. 그래도 삶은 계속되어야 하고 자식들은 먹여살려야 하지 않겠는가. 오늘날 우리가 대출 이자에 시달리듯 그때의 민중들은 동네 양반지주들에게 땅과 쌀을 빌렸다. 그런데 이게 문제였다. 당시 ‘장리’라고 불렸던 이자가 너무 컸기 때문이다. \n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}‘1년에 5할’, 보릿고개 시절 쌀을 빌리면 50%를 더하여 갚는 방식인데 ‘십오지사채’라고도 불렸다. 자기 땅을 가지고 있으면 20%의 세금을 내지만 땅을 빌리면 이자를 두 배 이상을 내야 했다. 비율제였기 때문에 쌀 100석을 생산하면 50석, 150석을 생산하면 75석을 내야하는 식이었다. 식량이 부족한 봄철, 이른바 춘궁기에 쌀을 빌리면 또다시 50%의 이자가 붙었다. 그 결과 추수 때가 되면 생산량의 60~80%를 이자로 내야 하는 경우도 적지 않았다. 임술농민봉기(1862), 동학농민운동(1894) 등 구한말 농민들의 저항이 계속된 이유도 결국은 무자비한 이자 때문이었다.\n소작 문제는 일제강점기 들어 더욱 악화되었다. 제국주의 본국에서 식민지 백성들의 고통에 무슨 관심이 있겠는가. 순사들은 모른 척으로 일관했고 총독부는 지주 편이었기 때문에 농민은 소작권마저 보장받지 못했다. 소설 《사하촌》에서는 갑자기 소작권을 빼앗겨서 어려움을 겪게 되는 농민 이야기부터 위에 나온 것처럼 빚을 감당하지 못하다 자신의 땅마저 빼앗기는 온갖 비극적인 이야기가 담겨있다.\n이자는 시대마다 다른 이름으로 불려 왔지만, 그 역사는 오래됐다. ‘돈놀이’나 ‘사채’ 같은 표현이 말해주듯, 돈을 빌려주고 이자를 받는 행위에 대한 경계와 불신은 고대부터 존재해왔다. 돈이나 땅을 빌려주어 이익을 얻는 사람들이 생겨났고, 이자를 감당하며 생계를 이어가는 방식 역시 시대와 지역을 가리지 않고 반복됐다.\n하지만 근대 산업혁명을 거치며 이자의 의미는 달라지기 시작한다. 금융 제도가 정비되고 경제를 운영하는 방식에 대한 이해가 깊어지면서, 이자는 개인 간 거래를 넘어 보다 조직적이고 전문적인 경제 활동의 일부로 자리 잡게 된다. 이 변화의 흐름 속에서, 이자를 다루는 방식으로 시대를 앞서간 ‘지아니니’라는 사람이 있었다.\n기회: 뱅크 오브 아메리카와 백설공주\n아마데오 지아니니(1870~1949)는 이탈리아 이민자 가정에서 태어났다. 미국 남북전쟁 이후 산업화와 국가 재건이 본격화되면서, 많은 이탈리아 이민자들이 미국에 자리를 잡았고 지아니니의 가족도 그중 하나였다. 당시 많은 이민자들이 그렇듯 지아니니 역시 13살의 어린 나이에 일을 시작했고 우연한 기회에 임대사업을 접한 후 장인의 부동산 사업을 도우며 돈의 흐름을 익혀갔다.\n31살이 되던 해 장인이 세상을 떠나자 지아니니는 샌프란시스코에 ‘뱅크 오브 이탈리아(Bank of Italy)’라는 작은 회사를 차렸다. 금융에 대한 이해가 부족하고 신용도가 낮아 기존 은행에서는 담보를 통한 대출이 불가능한 이들을 상대로 한 회사였다. 일종의 틈새시장을 노린 셈이지만, 대출 규모가 낮고 연체 위험 또한 높기 때문에 큰 수익을 보기 어려운 구조이기도 했다.\n2년간 어렵게 회사를 꾸려오던 1906년 4월 18일, 샌프란시스코를 강타한 대지진이 모든 것을 뒤흔들었다. 지아니니는 곧장 은행으로 달려가 200만 달러 규모의 금과 현금, 유가증권 등을 간신히 챙겨 나온다. 이날 지진은 규모 8.3으로, 약 3,000명의 사망자와 도시 인구의 절반을 넘는 23만 명의 이재민을 남긴 미국 역사상 최악의 지진 재해였다. 지진의 여파로 화재가 잇따르면서 지역의 군소 은행들은 무너졌고, 일부 은행은 금고가 녹아내릴 정도였다. 수많은 사람들의 재산이 하루아침에 공중으로 사라졌다.\n하지만 빠른 대응으로 자신과 고객의 자산을 지켜낸 지아니니에게 재난은 기회가 되었다. 그는 샌프란시스코 북쪽 해변 근처 부두에 자리를 잡고 나무 판자와 배럴을 책상 삼아, 삶의 터전을 잃은 사람들을 직접 만났다. 대지진과 화재로 모든 것을 잃은 이탈리아 이민자들에게 기존 은행들은 뻣뻣하게 굴었다. 담보가 없다는 이유로 대출을 거절했기 때문이다.\n하지만 지아니니의 선택은 달랐다. 그는 이민자들의 이야기를 직접 듣고, 사업 계획이 분명하다면 구매 물품을 담보 삼아 대출을 실행했다. 소문은 빠르게 퍼졌고, 작은 술집을 개조해 쓰던 은행은 곧 샌프란시스코 리틀 이탤리의 상징인 콜럼버스타워로 자리를 옮기게 된다. 소상공인의 사정을 이해하고 그에 맞는 금융을 설계한 지아니니의 방식이 힘을 발휘한 순간이었다.\n당시만 하더라도 금융은 미국 동부, 특히 뉴욕의 금융기관들이 꽉 잡고 있었고, 이들은 미국 서부를 변방으로 여겼다. 급변하던 샌프란시스코와 캘리포니아의 경제를 제대로 이해하지 못한 것도 사실이었다. 당시 미국 서부는 뜨거웠다. 일명 골드러시. 수많은 사람들이 몰려 들었고 항구와 철도같은 대단위 사업은 물론이고 이민자를 중심으로 과일, 와인, 통조림 등 농업과 식품산업이 커나가고 있었다. 지진에도 불구하고 재건 붐이 일며 서부는 빠르게 변화하고 있었다.\n20세기 초 호황기와 전쟁기를 거치며 그는 적극적인 대출을 이어갔고, 주법 은행과 국법 은행으로 나뉘어 있던 미국의 금융 시스템을 유연하게 활용해 사업을 빠르게 확장했다. 기존의 사업을 키우고 새로운 은행을 인수합병하는 가운데 그의 은행은 1928년 ‘뱅크 오브 아메리카(Bank of America)’로 이름이 바뀌었으며 이후 미국을 대표하는 금융기관으로 자리 잡는다.\n가난한 이탈리아 이민자를 상대하던 꼬마은행 사업가에서 미국을 대표하는 은행으로 성장하기까지. 지아니니는 합병과 인수를 거듭하며 기업이나 정치권과 교묘히 결탁하는 등 미국 금융계를 시끌벅적하게 만든 인물이기도 하다. 하지만 그의 뚝심과 소외된 영역에 과감히 투자하는 방식은 통했다.\n그는 월트 디즈니 스튜디오의 대출을 주관하기도 했다. 당시만 해도 ‘동화로 만든 만화영화를 누가 보겠느냐’는 인식이 투자자들 사이에서 지배적이었다. 하지만 지아니니는 제작 중이던 영화의 일부를 직접 확인한 뒤, 영화 필름 자체를 담보로 자금을 내주었다. 당시 디즈니는 제작비가 200만 달러 이상 초과되어 난항을 겪고 있었는데, 지아니니의 투자로 탄생한 작품이 바로 《백설공주와 일곱난쟁이》다. \n이후 찰리 채플린을 비롯해 20세기 폭스, 컬럼비아 영화사 등 여러 창작자와 기업이 지아니니의 금융 지원을 받으며 성장했다. 20세기 미국 대중문화사에서 그의 안목있는 투자 방식은 문화 산업의 위상을 바꾸어놓았다고 해도 과언이 아니다.\n질서: 세계의 시선을 한 몸에 받는 FED의 정책\n조선 후기와 일제강점기 조선 농민을 괴롭혔던 소작료, 그리고 산업혁명기 이탈리아 이민자들과 새로운 사업에 도움을 주었던 지아니니의 대출 사업. 두 사례에서 알 수 있듯 '이자'는 매우 이중적인 성격을 지니고 있다. 과도한 이자는 삶을 위협하지만, 이자 수익을 전제로 한 과감한 투자가 없으면 산업은 앞으로 나아가기 어렵다. 생계와 성장, 개인의 삶과 국가 경제. 이자는 이 두 세계가 만나는 지점에서 가장 현실적인 문제이기도 하다.\n아마 이 지점에서 자신의 역할을 가장 분명하게 수행한 인물이 매리너 애클스(Marriner Stoddard Eccles, 1890~1977)일 것이다. 사업가 출신이었던 그는 민주당 정부에서 연방준비제도(이하 연준)*의 위상을 이전과는 다른 차원으로 끌어올린 인물로 평가받는다.\n*미국의 통화금융정책을 수행하는 중앙은행제도, 보통 약자인 FED(Federal Reserve System)로 불린다.\n애클스가 프랭클린 루스벨트 대통령 시절 정부에 합류했을 당시만 해도, 연준은 여전히 19세기의 원칙을 그대로 따르고 있었다. 이른바 ‘진성어음주의’라 불리던 원칙에 따라, 경제활동에 적정한 상업어음을 할인해주는 것이 중앙은행의 역할이라고 여겼기 때문이다. 경제에 직접 개입하기보다는, 실물경제를 조용히 뒷받침하는 역할에 가까웠다.\n하지만 애클스가 살았던 시대는 그야말로 격변의 시기였다. 1929년 대공황으로 대량 실업이 발생했고, 설상가상으로 제2차 세계대전에, 6.25전쟁까지 벌어졌다. 국가도 개인도, 급변하는 정세에 위협받던 시기였다. 애클스가 보기에 적정한 통화정책과 규제정책의 실천은 단순히 나라 경제를 일으키는 것을 넘어 국민들의 삶을 돌보는 중요한 수단이었다. 경기가 침체될 때는 숨통을 틔워주고, 반대로 과열될 때는 속도를 늦춰야 한다는 것이 그의 생각이었다. 시장의 성장을 무작정 뒷받침하기보다, 물가 안정과 지속적인 성장을 함께 관리하는 기준이 필요하다고 보았다.\n애클스는 루스벨트 대통령을 설득했고, 연방준비제도법 개정 등 굵직한 제도 개혁을 이끌어냈다. 무엇보다 그는 연준의 독립과 자율성을 위한 제도적인 방안을 마련하는 데 동분서주했다. 재무부 장관과 차관의 연준 참여를 제한하고, 연준 이사의 교체 주기도 정권 교체에 영향을 받지 않는 방식으로 조정했으며, 대통령의 임기 동안 연준 위원 임명에 제한을 두었다. 즉, 로비스트들에 크게 영향을 받는 정권의 이해 관계를 벗어나 거시적인 경제정책을 추진하기 위한 제도적 기반을 만들었다. 소위 ‘금리 정책’을 통해 국민 경제의 안정을 기하는 방식, 대출 이자의 적정성을 도모하면서 기업과 가계에 도움이 되는 전통이 애클스에 의해 본격화된 것이다.\n침식: 나라를 담보로 한 대출\n조선 말 국가의 재정 상태는 엉망이었다. ‘나라에는 한 달 쓸 비축도 없다’라는 말이 나올 지경이었다. 서양 열강과 청나라, 일본의 간섭을 막으려면 국가 주도의 적극적인 근대화 정책이 필요했다. 하지만 철도를 놓고 전신을 연결하는 대단위 산업을 위해서는 막대한 양의 자금이 필요했고, 조선은 결정적으로 자금이 부족했다.\n이 와중에 1882년 임오군란을 진압하기 위해 청나라 군대가 조선에 파견됐고, 이때 중국의 정치인 이홍장은 자신의 심복인 원세개(위안스카이)를 함께 보낸다. 원세개의 목표는 명확했다. 막대한 자금을 대출해주고 조선을 청나라에 예속시킬 것. 정치력을 극대화하여 일본의 간섭을 뿌리치고 조선을 식민지로 만들 것. 이러한 원칙하에 원세개는 적극적인 차관 정책을 추진하였다.\n1882년 8월 조선은 청나라로부터 50만 냥의 돈을 연이자 8리(0.8%), 거치 7년 상환 조건으로 빌렸다. 개화 정책을 추진하기 위해 빌려온 대규모 차관이었다. 1885년 6월에는 ‘의주전선 조약’을 체결했는데 전신 시설을 위해 5년 거치 20년 기한으로 10만 냥의 차관을 또 빌렸다. 이 조약은 파격적이었다. 이자를 받지 않았기 때문이다. 대신 매년 5,000냥씩 무이자 상환을 하되 상환이 어려울 경우 전선부설권 및 관리권을 청나라가 갖는 것을 조건으로 했다. 1889년이 되면 조선이 청나라에게 빌린 돈이 130만 냥에 달했다.\n당시 조선은 갑신정변 때 피해를 이유로 배상금을 요구했던 일본의 5만 냥을 갚지 못해 세창양행* 같은 해외 기업으로부터 돈을 빌리고 있었다. 하지만 원세개는 끊임없는 내정간섭을 통해 청나라 이외의 나라에서부터 차관을 들여오는 것을 막았고, 그만큼 조선의 시장과 산업을 지배하였다. 물론 이 시도는 1894년 청일전쟁에서 청나라가 일본에 의해 완전히 패배하면서 끝나게 된다. 하지만 이후 일본은 같은 방식으로 조선을 집어삼키는 데 성공한다.\n*1884년 독일 마이어 상사(Meyer 商社)의 제물포 지점으로 설립된 무역상사. 근대화 정책을 명분으로 독일산 기계와 기술자 도입을 담당하며 각종 이권을 확보한 창구 역할을 했다.\n이 사례는 19-20세기 제국주의 국가들이 약소국을 지배해온 전형적인 방식이기도 하다. 자금에 의존하게 한 후, 빚은 점차 통제와 간섭으로 이어졌다. 돈을 빌려 감당할 수 없는 이자의 늪에 빠지는 것은 개인의 생계를 넘어, 때로는 국가의 존망까지 좌우하는 문제로 확장된다.\n사실 대출이자 몇 퍼센트가 올랐냐, 떨어졌냐를 두고 희비가 엇갈리는 것이 평범한 우리의 일상이다. 하지만 금리라는 숫자 뒤에는 언제나 더 큰 이야기가 놓여있다. 앞서 살펴본 네 가지 역사적 사례처럼 정부의 정책, 경기의 흐름, 그리고 국제사회의 변화 같은 구조적인 배경이 있다는 사실을 기억해야 한다. 지아니니와 애클스가 좋은 선례를 만들었던 것처럼, 이자와 금리는 책임 있게 다뤄질 때 기회와 질서가 된다.\n당연한 이야기지만, 좋은 정책을 통해 안정적으로 금리가 관리될 때 사람들은 삶을 잘 꾸리고 미래를 계획해 나갈 수 있다. 그리고 좋은 정책의 출발점에는 ‘세상이 어떻게 흘러가고 변화하는가’를 냉정하게 바라보는 국민들의 시선이 있다. 정부는 언제나 국민의 눈치를 보기 때문이다. 따라서 우리의 시선은 보다 이성적이면서도 공공적인 방향을 가리킬 필요가 있다.",
