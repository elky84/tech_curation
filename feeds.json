        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2025.06.13 registry release, 2025-04-16, 2025-05-19, and 2025-06-02 tool releases, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout May and June. This release includes bug fixes, several documentation changes, and the removal of the x-gha binary caching provider for GitHub (alternatives are described below).\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,621 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n35 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n517 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n132 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,900 forks and 25,100 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.06.13 release)\nThe following notable changes were made in this release:\nDue to recent changes in GitHub Actions Cache’s API, the x-gha binary caching provider has been rendered obsolete. As a result, we had to remove it from vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1662). Instead, you can use one of the following methods to cache binaries in GitHub; we welcome any feedback from our users about how this experience could be improved in the future:\n\nUse GitHub Packages with NuGet, which uses vcpkg’s caching mechanism and preserves caching granularity per port. This is the method the vcpkg team recommends.\nUse actions/cache in your workflow to cache the installed directory. The downside of this method is that the whole installed tree gets cached as a single artifact, so single port updates invalidate all packages.\nFixed a bug causing permissions while using upkg to not be preserved (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1625).\nImproved diagnostics and bug fixes for vcpkg x-test-features command (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1649, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1650, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1663, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1676, thanks @autoantwort!).\nFixed an issue causing slow binary cache insertions in some Docker containers (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1659, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1669, thanks @Thomas1664, @dg0yt!).\nOther minor bug fixes and internal feature improvements (thanks @autoantwort, @dg0yt, @huangqinjin, @DewJunkie!).\nDocumentation changes\nThe vcpkg docs have moved to the MicrosoftDocs organization, under the URL https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs. The existing repo has fully migrated with no loss in functionality. Links to the old repo should redirect to the new one automatically. The experience on the Learn website remains the same.\nAdded documentation for the new commands format-feature-baseline and x-test-features (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#455).\nAdded documentation for vcpkg license-report command (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#491).\nUpdated Tutorial: Set up a vcpkg binary cache using GitHub Packages in a GitHub Actions workflow to clarify that mono is no longer pre-installed by default for GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#495).\nUpdated vcpkg in MSBuild projects article to add instructions about how to pass MSBuild properties to vcpkg builds (PR: MicrosoftDocs/vcpkg-docs#481).\nRemoved documentation references to GitHub Actions Cache and x-gha provider, de-indexed the associated tutorial, and added a removal notice on the reference page.\nOther minor documentation improvements (thanks @Alan Pope, @Ivan Sorokin, @shijunz, @Tiago Freitas, @Yan Romao!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\nTriplet\nPorts available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2406\n\n\nx64-windows\n2524\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2524\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2398\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2450\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1410\n\n\narm64-windows\n2122\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2102\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1377\n\n\nx64-osx\n2394\n\n\narm64-osx\n2321\n\n\nx64-linux\n2510\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1939\n\n\nx64-android\n1996\n\n\narm64-android\n1961\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the July edition of Java Annotated Monthly! This issue is packed with fresh articles, helpful tips, and ideas to keep you inspired and motivated in your work.\nWe’re excited to feature Aicha Laafia, a Java engineer passionate about writing clean, green code and empowering women in tech. She’ll share how sustainable coding practices improve performance and reduce energy usage, and why mental well-being deserves just as much attention in our field.\nYou’ll also get a first look at the new Spring Debugger in IntelliJ IDEA – a powerful tool that reveals what’s really going on inside your Spring Boot app and helps you fix issues faster.\nAs always, we’ve gathered insightful notes on AI, upcoming events in July, and a few tech-adjacent thoughts to spark reflection and curiosity. Let’s dive in! 🚀\nFeatured Content \nAicha Laafia\n\nI’m Aicha Laafia, a Java software engineer with a love for coding, an interest in sustainability, and a commitment to empowering women in tech. I am a Women Techmakers and Girls Code ambassador, a member of the Moroccan Association of Computing Science, and part of the JetBrains Community Contributor program.\n \nI focus on creating software with minimal environmental impact while mentoring and supporting women in technology. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring delicious food, phone photography, and watching Formula 1.\n\nI’m excited to share what I’m passionate about: making Java apps not just clean and fast, but also greener and more efficient.\nClean code keeps you sane at 2am. Green code keeps your infrastructure costs sane at scale. It’s also more interesting! You have to squeeze performance out of what you have with no sloppy code hiding behind overkill hardware.\nOne of the biggest sources of wasted resources is start-up and warm-up time. Microservices and serverless functions spin up and down constantly. Every millisecond wasted during startup is wasted CPU cycles and energy.\nThis is why I would love to introduce one of JDK 24’s game-changing features, Ahead-of-Time Class Loading (JEP 483). It preloads and links classes before runtime, slashing startup and warm-up lag. Faster startup means microservices waste fewer CPU cycles, directly cutting energy use in cloud-native environments. I’ve covered this in detail in my article JDK 24: Faster, Smarter, and Ready for the Future.\nPair this with GraalVM 24.2’s native image capabilities – near-instant start-up and a low memory footprint – and you get serious energy savings and better performance.\nLooking ahead to JDK 25 and beyond, they’re adding some solid improvements for performance and efficiency:\nJEP 514 and JEP 515 bring better ergonomics and profiling for Ahead-of-Time compilation, making startup faster and CPU use smarter. I am super excited about JEP 521, which enhances Shenandoah GC with generational collection, cutting pause times and improving memory management.\nIf you want to dive deeper into practical green coding with Java, check out my Green Programming 101 article series. If video is more your thing, here’s my recent live talk at vJUG: How to Build Sustainable Java Applications.\nBefore I say goodbye, remember there’s one resource we often overlook: ourselves. Just like we monitor and optimize CPU and memory, it’s crucial to monitor your mental health and watch for burnout. It’s a hidden struggle many developers face.

Kakao Pay leverages Kotlin with Spring for backend development across various services, including its insurance offerings. Check out Kakao Pay’s story to see how Kotlin helps it address the complex requirements of the insurance industry and enables the reliable development and operation of services.\nNote: At Kakao Pay, each employees have their own nicknames to represent themselves. They address each other by calling their nickname instead of the actual name. Kuyho Chung, the writer of this post, uses ‘katfun.joy’ as his nickname.\n\n\n\n\nkatfun.joy, a backend developer at Kakao Pay, uses Kotlin to develop stable backend services. In this post, he introduces some of Kotlin’s most impressive features, such as value validation object creation, safe null handling, utility library creation using extension functions, and efficient unit tests, based on direct usage experience. If you are a backend developer interested in developing stable web services, it is recommended to read this.\n💡 Reviewer’s One-Line Review\nyun.cheese: Gain Kotlin tips that can be directly applied to actual service development through the vivid experiences of a developer deeply immersed in Kotlin’s charm!\nnoah.you: A compelling Kotlin use case to address the complex requirements of insurance! There are many good examples, so take a look!\nari.a: Why does Kakao Pay use Kotlin for the backend development of its services? For those curious, we recommend Katfun’s Kotlin use case!\nGetting Started\nHello. I am Katfun, and I develop and operate services such as insurance comparison recommendations and car management services at Kakao Pay Insurance Market department.\nAt Kakao Pay, we use Kotlin for backend service development, including for our insurance services and various other services.\nBefore joining Kakao Pay, I had no experience with Kotlin, but as I used it, I became captivated by its convenience and various advantages. For example, here are some of Kotlin’s charms.\nUsing Kotlin allows us to make the services we operate more robust, stable, and efficient.\nWe easily gathered and managed content for specific domains or created libraries exclusively for our services.\nWriting test codes with clear purposes and targets was also easily done through Kotlin.\nAfter joining Kakao Pay and developing and operating several services with Kotlin, I wanted to introduce the charm of Kotlin that I experienced firsthand. Of the many great things about Kotlin, I have focused on four of its key charming aspects. This is a particularly good read for backend developers interested in developing stable web services, like me.\nCreating objects with validated values at creation\nWhen creating a VO(1) representing a value, there are cases where input values need to be transformed or validated. Although validation logic can be separated into a different class, if you have to call the validation logic separately each time, there is a possibility of skipping validation by mistake. Here is an example of concise code that guarantees validation using various Kotlin features.\nIn this VO representing a car number, we use Kotlin’s value class.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber(val input: String)\nA value class is a wrapper class for representing values in Kotlin. It can only have a single immutable field, and in the JVM environment, the class is unwrapped during compilation and replaced with its internal value. Thanks to this, primitive type values can be handled like objects, and it also solves the overhead problem of using wrapper classes. For more details, please refer to the Project Valhalla content in the References section.\nLet’s assume the following rules for license plate numbers (car numbers).\nSpaces aren’t allowed\nThe car number format must be one of the following\n\n12가1234\n123가1234\n서울1가1234\n서울12가1234\nWhen creating a CarNumber instance, we want to remove the spaces and implement the following criteria:\nThe region name must be from the given list (Seoul, Gyeonggi, Daejeon, etc.), otherwise, an exception occurs.\nIf there is no region name, the first number must be 2–3 digits, and the last number must be 4 digits.\nIf there is a region name, the first number must be 1–2 digits, and the last number must be 4 digits.\nThis was added as validation in the factory method.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        private val CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"(\\\\d{2,3})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\")\n        private val OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"^([가-힣]{1,2})?(\\\\d{1,2})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\\$\")\n        private val LOCATION_NAMES = setOf(\"서울\", \"부산\", \"대구\", \"인천\", \"광주\", \"대전\", \"울산\", \"경기\", \"강원\", \"충북\", \"충남\", \"전북\", \"전남\", \"경북\", \"경남\", \"제주\")\n\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpaces())\t// Remove spaces\n        }\n    }\n\n    init {\n        validateCarNumber(value)\n    }\n\n    private fun validateCarNumber(number: String) {\n        val oldCarNumberMatch = OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matchEntire(number)\n        if (oldCarNumberMatch != null) {\n            val (location, _, _) = oldCarNumberMatch.destructured\n            require(location in LOCATION_NAMES) { \"Unknown registration region.\" }\t// Exception occurs if the region name of the old car number is not in the list\n        } else {\n            require(CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matches(number)) { \"Please check the car number format.\" }\t// Exception occurs if it does not match the car number forma\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the code may seem a bit complex, the steps are as follows.\nCall the CarNumber.from() factory method to remove hyphens and spaces.\nInvoke the logic during instance creation using the init { } block.\n\nVerify whether it matches one of the two regular expressions (new car number, old car number).\nIf it is an old car number, check whether the region name is in the list.\nThe regular expressions (regex) and region names used for validation are written in the companion object and used as a singleton.\nDoes writing the code like this solve all the problems? Unfortunately, there is still the issue of the constructor being exposed.\nval carNumber = CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\") // Exception occurs because spaces are not removed.\n\n\n\n\nIf the constructor is called directly, the space removal process created in the factory method cannot be applied. Fortunately, it is possible to prevent the constructor from being called directly. You can add the private constructor access modifier to it.\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n\n\n\n\nBy adding private constructor, you can enforce the creation of CarNumber instances only through the factory method. However, this implementation may be somewhat unfriendly to CarNumber users. Users may attempt to create an instance using the constructor like CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\"), but until they write the code, they won’t know that the constructor is blocked with private and that they need to use the factory method like CarNumber.from(\"123 가 4567\") instead.\n\n\n\n\nThis can be resolved by overloading Kotlin’s invoke operator. Kotlin provides guidance that “function-type values can be called using the invoke operator”.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        // ...\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpacesAndHyphens())\n        }\n\n        operator fun invoke(carNumber: String): CarNumber = from(carNumber)\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage example\nval carNumber = CarNumber(\"123 가 4567\")\t// Actually calls from instead of the constructor.\n\n\n\n\nThis allows users to create CarNumber instances as if they are directly calling the constructor, but internally, it hides the call to the factory method from.\nIn some cases, the factory method from can also be hidden with private. This makes it so users no longer need to worry about whether to use the constructor or the factory method when creating a CarNumber instance. At the same time, it also prevents the creation of CarNumber instances with broken consistency.\nFinally, when using Jackson for serialization and deserialization, add the @JsonCreator annotation to the from factory method to use it. This completes a VO that satisfies all intended conditions. Below is the final completed CarNumber class.\n@JvmInline\nvalue class CarNumber private constructor(val value: String) {\n    companion object {\n        private val CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"(\\\\d{2,3})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\")\n        private val OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(\"^([가-힣]{1,2})?(\\\\d{1,2})([가-힣])(\\\\d{4})\\$\")\n        private val LOCATION_NAMES =\n            setOf(\"서울\", \"부산\", \"대구\", \"인천\", \"광주\", \"대전\", \"울산\", \"경기\", \"강원\", \"충북\", \"충남\", \"전북\", \"전남\", \"경북\", \"경남\", \"제주\")\n\n        @JsonCreator\n        fun from(carNumber: String): CarNumber {\n            return CarNumber(carNumber.removeSpacesAndHyphens())\n        }\n\n        operator fun invoke(carNumber: String): CarNumber = from(carNumber)\n    }\n\n    init {\n        validateCarNumber(value)\n    }\n\n    private fun validateCarNumber(number: String) {\n        val oldCarNumberMatch = OLD_CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matchEntire(number)\n        if (oldCarNumberMatch != null) {\n            val (location, _, _) = oldCarNumberMatch.destructured\n            require(location in LOCATION_NAMES) { \"Unknown registration region.\" }\n        } else {\n            require(CAR_NUMBER_REGEX.matches(number)) { \"Please check the car number format.\" }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nWhen writing code like the example above in Kotlin, you can create VOs for various values and perform validation and transformation before instance creation. Writing the code this way allows you to delegate all roles and responsibilities related to car numbers to the VO. If policies related to car numbers change, you only need to check the CarNumber class. This naturally prevents unintended values from being used as car numbers and helps create stable services.\nExample\nLet’s take a closer look with a simple example. There is an API that receives input from users as shown below. If you declare the carNumber field in the request class as a CarNumber VO instead of a string, an exception will be immediately raised when the API is called with a car number that does not meet the conditions. There is no need to call separate validation logic, and if a CarNumber instance is successfully created, it guarantees that the car number value is valid.\n@RestController\nclass CarController {\n    @PostMapping(\"/car\")\n    fun carInformation(@RequestBody request: CarInformationRequest) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n\ndata class CarInformationRequest(\n    val carNumber: CarNumber\n)\n\n\n\n\nEnsuring null safety\nKotlin provides various ways to handle null safely. Here’s an example of one that helps with writing and understanding logic through immutability and smart casting(2)\nThere is a retryLogic method that resends an existing request. It performs the following actions:\nExplore the retryUseCase that matches the received category code.\n– Throw an exception if not found.\nSend a retry request using the found retryUseCase.\nThe code is as follows:\nfun retryLogic(\n    categoryCode: CategoryCode,\n    transactionId: String,\n    request: RetryRequest\n) {\n    val retryUseCase: UseCase? = activeUseCases().firstOrNull { it.type == categoryCode }\n    requireNotNull(retryUseCase) { \"The retry request is currently unavailable.\" }\n\n    // Separate business logic\n\n    return retryUseCase.getPrice(transactionId, request)\n}\n\n\n\n\nval retryUseCase is a value of type UseCase?. This indicates that the value could either be a UseCase or null. In Kotlin, unless you explicitly specify that the value’s type is nullable by adding a ? after it, the value cannot hold null by default.\nNext, perform a null check on the received value. The commonly used method is to check for nullability using if.\nif (retryUseCase == null) throw IllegalArgumentException(\"The retry request is currently unavailable.\")\n\n\n\n\nIn Kotlin, you can write the exact same functionality using a contract called requireNotNull.\nEven after checking for nullability, the problem is not completely resolved. If the value changes in the middle after the null check, then even if you previously checked for null on retryUseCase, you cannot be certain that it is still not null. In the above code, this is represented as the ‘separate business logic’ section.\nThe reason Kotlin is particularly strong in this area is because of Kotlin’s immutability. Values are declared using either val or var, and values declared with val are immutable. In other words, once a value is assigned, it does not change. This also applies when checking for null; once a value is confirmed to be not null, it is guaranteed to remain not null. In the example above, after requireNotNull(retryUseCase), the value is guaranteed not to be null.\nThis is also confirmed from a Kotlin language perspective through smart casting.\n\n\n\n\nThrough smart casting, the Kotlin compiler treats the type of retryUseCase as UseCase rather than UseCase? after requireNotNull(retryUseCase). The green-highlighted part in the image above represents this. Thanks to this, when writing or debugging code, you can confirm that a value that could be null is not null and proceed with the logic with confidence. This is, of course, a great help in the stable operation of services.\nCreating a utility library using extension functions\nSeveral utility codes are commonly used in the development of insurance services. In particular, there are many cases where something is manipulated for primitive type fields or strings. These were gathered to create a library called insurance-common.\nKotlin’s extension functions and object declarations can be used in the creation of such a library. Kotlin’s extension functions allow you to extend methods without separate design patterns or the inheritance of specific classes. Object declarations are used to contain content independent of the state of a specific instance. At the language level, they are declared as singletons, which is good for preventing the unnecessary creation of the same content multiple times.\nFor example, a method called maskingName is written to mask the corresponding code when a specific pattern is found in strings.\nprivate val maskingNameRegex = Regex(\"(?i)Name=[^,)]++[,)]\")\n\n/**\n* Masks numbers surrounded by \"Number=\" and \",\" or \")\" in a string, except for the first digit\n*/\nfun maskingName(input: String): String {\n    return input.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n}\n\n// Usage example\nval maskedValue = maskingName(userName)\n\n\n\n\nIf the above code is refactored using Kotlin’s extension functions, it can be modified as follows.\nfun String.maskingName() = this.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n\n// Usage example\nval maskedValue = userName.maskingName()\nThe masking method was extended to the string class. This method is unrelated to the state of a specific instance. In other words, declaring it as a singleton(3) and reusing it is advantageous for resource management. It can be used as a singleton by using a Kotlin object declaration.\nobject StringUtils {\n    private val maskingNameRegex = Regex(\"(?i)Name=[^,)]++[,)]\")\n\n    /**\n     * Masks strings surrounded by \"Number=\" and \",\" or \")\", except for the first character\n     */\n    fun String.maskingName() = this.replace(maskingNameRegex) { \"${it.value.substring(0, 6)}*${it.value.last()}\" }\n}\n\n\n\n\nExamples of its usage can be confirmed through unit tests.\n@DisplayName(\"Masks strings surrounded by Number= and , or ) except for the first character\")\n@Test\nfun maskingName() {\n    // given\n    val name = \"Kim Chun-sik\"\n    val text = \"userName=$name, result=\\\"success\\\"\"\n    val lowerText = \"name=$name, result=\\\"success\\\"\"\n\n    // when\n    val result = text.maskingName()\n    val lowerResult = lowerText.maskingName()\n\n    // then\n    val expectedMaskedResult = \"Kim*\"\n\n    assertThat(result).isEqualTo(\"userName=$expectedMaskedResult, result=\\\"success\\\"\")\n    assertThat(lowerResult).isEqualTo(\"name=$expectedMaskedResult, result=\\\"success\\\"\")\n    }\n\n\n\n\nIn this way, functions used throughout the insurance service are being turned into libraries. This has reduced duplicate code across multiple ongoing projects and allowed their use without any performance degradation or other drawbacks. All of this is thanks to Kotlin’s extension functions and object declarations. Code managed this way is easy to read and maintain, greatly aiding in service operation.\nSimple and efficient unit testing using data classes\nWhen writing unit tests, data classes can be useful for setting up situations for testing. A data class in Kotlin is, as the name suggests, a class for representing data. Unlike regular classes, equals() and hashCode() are redefined, and other methods like copy() are automatically generated. Using data classes is useful when writing classes that represent data, such as DTOs(4).\nThis is an example of a DTO that needs to be tested.\ndata class UserInformation(\n    val name: String,\n    val age: Int,\n    val birthDate: LocalDate,\n    val address: String,\n    val gender: Gender,\n    val isDisplay: Boolean\n) {\n    enum class Gender {\n        MALE,\n        FEMALE;\n    }\n\n    init {\n        require(age >= 18)\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe goal is to test whether age validation works. If the age is 18 or older, no exception should be thrown, and if it is under 18, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown. Here’s one way to write the test:\nclass WhateverTest() {\n    @Test\n    fun `Throws IllegalArgumentException if age is under 18`() {\n        assertThrows {\n            val userInformation = UserInformation(\n                name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n                age = 17,\n                birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n                address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n                gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n                isDisplay = true\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `Does not throw exception if age is 18 or older`() {\n        assertDoesNotThrow {\n            val userInformation = UserInformation(\n                name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n                age = 18,\n                birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n                address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n                gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n                isDisplay = true\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDo you see the problem?\nThe target of the test is unclear.\nUnnecessary code is repeated.\nIt is difficult to determine from the test code above which values in UserInformation contribute to the exception. Adding comments could partially resolve this, but if the DTO has dozens of fields, it would be hard to identify which fields have comments at a glance. Additionally, to create a UserInformation instance, appropriate values must be assigned to fields other than age.\nTo address this, the copy() function of the data class can be used. copy() has the following characteristics:\nA completely identical data class instance is created. When compared with the original instance using equals(), they are considered equal.\nWhen calling copy(), you can specify values for parameters. In this case, only the specified values of the corresponding parameters are copied.\nReturning to the code above, let’s separate the common parts and revise it to make the test target clearer.\nclass WhateverTest() {\n    @Test\n    fun `Throws IllegalArgumentException if age is under 18`() {\n        val invalidAge = 17\n        assertThrows {\n            val userInformation = successUserInformation.copy(age = invalidAge)\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Test\n    fun `Does not throw exception if age is 18 or older`() {\n        val validAge = 18\n        assertDoesNotThrow {\n            val userInformation = successUserInformation.copy(age = validAge)\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val successUserInformation = UserInformation(\n        name = \"Chung Katfun\",\n        age = 28,\n        birthDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 19),\n        address = \"Kakao Pangyo Agit\",\n        gender = UserInformation.Gender.MALE,\n        isDisplay = true\n    )\n}\n\n\n\n\nHere are the two versions of the code arranged side by side for comparison.\n\n\n\n\nDo you notice the difference? Using copy():\nReduced repeated code.\nClearly highlighted the target affecting the test.\nThis lowers the barrier to writing tests and improves their readability. As a result, tests can better serve as documentation, and they can be used to write stable services. This is also valid when writing tests in a BDD(5) style, such as given-when-then or arrange-act-assert.\nConclusion\nAs someone responsible for the server side of our system, my priority is building services that are stable, readable, and scalable. Since I started using Kotlin two years ago at Kakao Pay, I’ve been able to meet these goals step by step while developing a variety of applications.\nI wrote this blog post to share my experience in the hope that it helps others build and operate reliable backend systems.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Imagine you are proud of yourself for creating an amazing Java application, framework, or a library. You open one of its source files to make some changes and this is what you see:\nimport java.lang.reflect.*;\nimport java.nio.file.Path;\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\nimport java.io.InputStreamReader;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.stream.Collector;\nimport java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;\nimport java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWiteLock;\nimport java.time.LocalDateTime;\n// more import statements\nWhile looking at this long list of imports, are you wondering why you need to know the name of every single class or interface used in your class (apart from its configuration)? It seems like a cognitive load to me. Most of the developers I know collapse this section in their IDE and don’t bother expanding it.\nThe business logic in this source file probably starts after line twenty. Can you do something about it because importing packages won’t help much. Don’t worry, Module Import Declarations can help address this import hell for you.\nWhat is ‘Module Import Declarations’?\nIntroduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and a production feature in Java 25, Module import declarations enable you to import an entire module using a single import statement. In the above example, you can replace all the import statements with the following line of code, since all those packages are defined as part of the java.base module:\nimport module java.base.*;\nYes, just one line of code. The source file can now use List, Map, Stream, Path, and many more classes. As a developer, you no longer need to think about which package they live in. With this single statement, you can import all of the packages exported by the module java.base.\nWhy should you care about this feature?\nApart from the obvious benefits of concise code and escaping from the import hell, this feature helps us developers focus on solving business problems rather than finding the fully qualified names for classes or interfaces to use. Do you think it is worth your time to find out whether the interface Function is defined in the package java.util.function or java.util?. An intelligent IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA helps you to get around it by adding the relevant imports as soon as you use a type in your code (more about it in a later section in this blog post).\nIt offers convenience for new developers. Imagine you are a new Java developer. Would you prefer having an umbrella import statement so that you need not be bothered about knowing which package defines the commonly used data structures, such as List, Map, or Stream? If you are teaching Java, talking about importing classes interfaces from packages before folks get comfortable using basic data structures could make them lose focus. It would be better for them to get started writing programs that use List and Stream, rather than having them figure out which Java package defines them. Module import declarations help beginners focus on learning Java without getting confused or frustrated by things they don’t need to worry about yet.\nIt enables faster prototyping. When we are prototyping, we try to get things to work as quickly as possible. In such cases, an umbrella import statement, such as the import module declaration, lets us jump straight into coding. It also keeps the code concise, cleaner and easier to read when we are using large APIs. But this doesn’t imply that you should define your code in a module to use a module import statement.\nBefore moving forward, let’s cover the IntelliJ IDEA configurations for using this feature.\nIntelliJ IDEA Configuration\nImport Module declaration was introduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and IntelliJ IDEA has supported this feature since version 2024.3. In soon to be released Java 25, it becomes a production feature (it is now a permanent language feature, and safe to use in your production code). \nJava 25 is scheduled to be released in September 2025. To use this feature as a production feature (without needing the --enable-preview flag during compilation and runtime), you should download the early access version of JDK. You can also do this from IntelliJ IDEA’s settings dialog (Yes! IntelliJ IDEA allows you to download and configure EA versions of the JDK):\n\n\n\n\nIn your Project Settings, set the SDK to Java 25. For the language level, select ‘X – Experimental features’ on both the Project and Modules tabs. This enables you to use all Java 25 features, including those currently under review. Java 25 is due to be released in September 2025, and we at JetBrains are working on adding more support. New language options will be accessible in IntelliJ IDEA soon.\nMore about Module Import Declarations\nKnowing why we need a feature is the first step to using it. Let’s look at how to use it and also answer some frequently asked questions from developers about this feature.\nSyntax of Module Import Declarations\nThe syntax is simple. It starts with the keyword import, followed by module and the name of the module (without a wildcard, that is, *):\nimport module java.base.*;\nThis feature doesn’t work with unnamed modules. Revisit the syntax of this feature: it requires you to name the module you want to import. The example in this section imports the java.base module. \nHow to determine the fully qualified name of types in your source code?\nAre you wondering how to determine the fully qualified name of a type or variable in your source code when using import module declarations? This was one of the main reasons for using individual imports in source files. This applies to all types of imports, including wildcard and static imports.\nMove your cursor to the type in a variable declaration and use the Quick Documentation feature (Ctrl+Q for Win/Linux, or F1 on macOS) to view a documentation popup that shows the package name at the top, followed by the name and its documentation—without having to open another source file in your editor window. You can also use the Quick Definition feature (Ctrl+Shift+I) to view the fully qualified name, along with the definitions of its members, in a popup window. Alternatively, you can hover over the type using your mouse to view the fully qualified name.\n\n\n\n\nOn a separate note, if you don’t like showing Quick Documentation popups on mouse hover, you can clear the ‘Show quick documentation on hover’ checkbox in the settings (find it using Shift+Shift). If you want to browse the source code of the used type, use the ‘Go to Declaration or Usages’ feature (Ctrl+B / Cmd+B), which opens the source code in a new editor window.\nIn the next section, let’s see how to use the import module statement with different libraries or APIs.\nHow to import JUnit 3.8.1 using import module declaration?\nI know it is an old version, but it is still around and in use. How would you import classes and interfaces defined in JUnit 3.8.1 (if you had to) in your source files? To import it using an import module declaration, you must use its module name. The short answer is you cannot because there is no module name for it. JUnit 3.8.1 was created before Java 9 introduced modules.\nWhat about other libraries? How do we find their module names? We usually use build tools, such as Maven, to import dependencies as jar files. If a dependency supports modules, its jar file includes module-info.class (mandatory for modules), which contains the module name. You’ll notice that the JUnit 3.8.1 jar doesn’t include module-info.class.\nIntelliJ IDEA users can view module info in External libraries, in the Project Structure window, as  shown below:\n\n\n\n\nOf course, you could ask the AI Chat window in IntelliJ IDEA how to find these module names.\nWhich packages are exported by the modules you import?\nEach module defines a module-info.java file that includes information about the packages that module exports to all modules or to specific other modules. \nLet’s try to understand this by checking out what happens when you import the module java.base using IntelliJ IDEA. Click on the module name in the editor or use the relevant shortcut (Go to Declaration or Usages) and you could view the definition of this module to find out all the modules exported by this module. This is shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nThe public API in these packages are available to source files that import these modules.\nWhat do you mean by on-demand import?\nDevelopers often argue about importing a single class or interface versus importing all public entities by importing a package using a wildcard character. Which of these do you think is better?\nWhen you import a module or a package using a wildcard (*), you import types on demand. This means you can use any public class, interface, or entity from a package or module without importing each one individually.\nOften, developers ask if importing a full module increases the size of their .class files. The short answer is no. On-demand imports make all public classes and interfaces in the module available to use in a source file, but the compiler includes only those that are actually used in your code.\nName conflicts (compilation error)\nWhen you import one or more modules, it is possible that packages within the same module or across modules define classes with the same name. For an example, in the example code below, code at line number 5 (Date date;) won’t compile because importing java.base module makes java.util.Date class available, and importing the java.sql module makes java.sql.Date available:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3. \n4.    public class NameConflicts {\n5.        Date date;  // compilation error\n6.    }\nLet’s assume you want to use the Date class from module java.sql. To address this issue, you could either add a single import statement, as follows:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3.    import java.sql.Date;\n4.    \n5.    public class NameConflicts {\n6.        Date date;  \n7.    }\nYou could also resolve it by using a fully qualified class name, as follows:\n1.    import module java.base;  // Makes available java.util.Date\n2.    import module java.sql;   // Makes available java.sql.Date\n3. \n4.    public class NameConflicts {\n5.        java.sql.Date date;  \n6.    }\nIntelliJ IDEA can highlight name conflicts as you type your code. Invoke context actions to view a list of qualified class names (package name + class name) to choose from, as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are wondering whether it is a good idea to import modules since it could lead to namespace conflicts, these issues can occur with importing packages too. Don’t worry; it results in a compilation error and can be fixed easily.\nAlso, a module and one of the packages it includes can have the same name. Notice that the module java.sql contains a package java.sql. The fully qualified name of a class or an interface includes its package name, not the name of the module the package is defined in.\nCompact Source Files integration\nGavin Bierman mentioned that the idea of this Import Module Declarations came up while the Java team was working on JEP Compact Source Files and Instance main Methods, which aim to reduce the ceremony to learning Java. \nCompact source files implicitly import the module java.base. It implies that the new developers can use any public class or interface from the multiple packages exported by the java.base module, without explicit import statements.\nJShell Integration\nOne of the main benefits of using JShell is that it allows you to quickly evaluate expressions, execute code statements or snippets (and much more) without the ceremony of defining classes.\nPrior to Import Module Declarations, JShell automatically imported the ten most used packages (and java.lang) so that developers could easily use those classes or interfaces without explicit import statements. However, you still need import statements for classes or interfaces not defined in these packages, such as the LocalDateTime class from the package java.time:\n\n\n\n\nWith import module declarations, JShell automatically imports the module java.base. This helps developers use many more classes (such as LocalDateTime), without needing explicit import statement, as shown in the following image:\n\n\n\n\nOne import statement to use the entire standard Java API\nBy importing the java.se module you can use the entire standard Java API in your source file. Here’s the module information for this module:\n\n\n\n\nThe java.se module is an aggregator module. It does not export any package, but requires other modules transitively. In other words, source files importing java.se import the packages exported by modules that are marked required transitive in java.se.\nInterview with creators of this feature\nWe also interviewed the owner of this feature, Gavin Bierman, Programming Language Designer at Oracle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGavin mentioned that this feature was co-developed with the JEP Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods. He covered the differences between single-type imports and type-import-on-demand declarations, explaining what they are and why individuals and organizations prefer one style over the other. He also talked about how the “Module Import Declarations” feature automatically imports on demand from transitive dependencies of modules. He discussed ambiguous imports and how to deal with them, name ambiguity, and how to submit relevant feedback on this feature to the teams at OpenJDK.\nPractical Tips\nPractical tips and wisdom are always useful when using a feature.\nMigrating your codebases to use import module declarations\nI’d recommend not replacing all the individual import statements or package statements with import module statements in your codebase. Try module imports in new files or when you’re already touching existing code.\nThis feature is syntactic sugar; it makes your code more readable but doesn’t offer any performance benefits. The folks who maintain your code are more important than using the latest shiny features in your codebase. If they understand the code in its existing format, respect that.\nGroup Your Imports\nWith module imports, Java offers multiple types of imports, such as, importing modules, importing packages, importing classes/interfaces, and static imports of fields or methods. Grouping imports could make them more readable.\nIntelliJ IDEA supports importing types as you type them\nWhether you are copy-pasting code or typing it, IntelliJ IDEA adds the relevant imports to your codebase, either automatically or by prompting you to select the correct version to import, as shown in the following gif:\n\n\n\n\nJust in case, the preceding settings don’t work for you, ensure you have enabled the relevant import settings in ‘Intentions’ (use IntelliJ IDEA Settings), as follows:\n\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t been using this feature in IntelliJ IDEA, you are missing out on a great user experience.\nSummary\nIntroduced as a preview feature in Java 23 and a production feature in Java 25, Module Import Declarations allow importing an entire module with a single import statement.\nApart from the obvious benefits of replacing multiple import statements with a single import, this feature helps us developers escape import hell. It works only with named modules, not unnamed ones or older libraries without module definitions (such as JUnit 3.8.1). Classes and interfaces are imported on demand. Importing a module makes its public classes/interfaces available, but only those actually used are included by the compiler. Importing multiple modules might lead to class name conflicts, requiring specific imports or fully qualified names.\nJShell and compact source files automatically import java.base with this feature. If you want to extend it, try importing the java.se module, which provides access to the entire standard Java API. The release of Java 25 is scheduled for September, but IntelliJ IDEA already supports this feature. Try it out and let us know your feedback.\nHappy coding.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The concept of remote development is deceptively simple: spin up your development environment somewhere that’s not your local machine. The perks range from freeing up local resources to not panicking when your laptop gets stolen.\nYet, there are plenty of pitfalls, including flaky setups, poor visibility, and lousy monitoring. Let’s look at some best practices of remote development and see what JetBrains has to offer.\n1. Get rid of RDP/VNC/VDS\nIf you’re still “remote developing” by pixel-streaming, you’re wasting your time. Real remote development feels local, handles flaky networks gracefully, and scales far beyond your laptop.\nReality check: Streaming your whole desktop is like lugging a cinema projector over SSH. Every keystroke triggers massive pixel redraws, your IDE becomes sluggish, and one lost packet freezes everything. Why move video frames instead of code diffs? Modern remote protocols only send keystrokes and UI deltas. Latency plunges, and your IDE snaps back to life.\n2. Stay online, even when you’re not\nFlaky Wi-Fi isn’t an excuse anymore. A proper remote development client buffers your edits locally, shows a “reconnecting” notice, and pushes your changes when you’re back online. Linting, inspections, breakpoints – they pick up seamlessly. You keep context, and your work never vanishes into thin air.\n3. Enterprise-grade orchestration\nOne VM or container remotely? Sure, great for demos. But ten teams? A dozen projects? Manual SSH scripts crumble fast. You need a Cloud Dev Environment (CDE) orchestrator that addresses the following pain points:\n\nPain PointHand-Rolled SSH/Docker/VMCDE Orchestrator (e.g., CodeCanvas)\nResource scalingStatic, brittleAuto-scale, auto-stop, snapshots\nEnvironment drift“Works on my machine”Versioned templates, pre-built images\nProvisioningManual installsPre-warmed toolchains, secrets, plugins\nSecurityOpen SSH risksZero-trust relays, jump servers, air-gapped lockdown\nVisibilityDark – no metricsDashboards for usage, health, failures\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re not automating this stuff, you’re putting your team at a disadvantage.\n4. CodeCanvas: JetBrains’ answer\nWe built CodeCanvas to cover every base:\nDev environment templates: Versioned, shareable, based on Docker images (build your own if needed), IDE backends included.\nAuto-provisioning: Plugins, VS Code extensions, secrets – everything installs itself.\nCost control: Idle workspaces auto-stop, warm-up snapshots and standby pools minimize startup delays.\nZero-trust security: WebSocket relays (no inbound pods), SSH jump servers as needed, and strict clipboard restrictions.\nObservability: Real-time dashboards to monitor environment creation, adoption rates, crashes, and idle times.\n5. Borrow, don’t reinvent – follow the leaders\nGitHub Codespaces: Uses devcontainer.json, spins up on GitHub’s infrastructure.\nGitpod: Declares workspace configuration via .gitpod.yml, provides consistent branch environments.\nCoder: Brings developers and AI coding agents together in secure self-hosted environments on your infrastructure.\nCodeCanvas: Scalable Kubernetes-based environments (EKS, AKS, GKE, or your bare-metal clusters) designed for distributed teams.\nIf you’re building your own, ask yourself: what do these platforms handle that I’m missing?\n6. Workflow orchestration beats task automation\nCreating a VM is just a task. Combining container builds, secret management, post-hooks, health checks, and cleanup – that’s orchestration. True CDE platforms handle this complexity gracefully. If you’re still scripting “docker run” in shell scripts, you’re reinventing the wheel.\n7. Short-lived environments are mandatory\nIf you try to cram everything into a single long-living environment, you’ll just be stuck twiddling your thumbs during branch switches and rebuilds. When environments spin up in seconds, they become disposable. This allows a fresh environment for each feature or code review, tossed away as soon as you’re done with it. Warm-up snapshots and standby pools have turned “cold start” into a thing of the past. Short-lived CDEs ensure consistency, security, and predictable costs.\n8. Security and compliance: don’t get pwned\nZero trust: Authenticate and authorize every single IDE connection.\nNetwork isolation: Use per-cluster relays and jump servers with no direct SSH. Restrict clipboard actions to prevent data leaks.\nPolicy enforcement: Align your practices with security benchmarks – development environments are vulnerable if left unguarded.\n9. Metrics that actually matter\nDashboards aren’t just window dressing – they drive optimization. Get an overview of:\nStartup latency: From spin-up to first build or indexing.\nResource utilization: CPU, memory, and I/O per workspace.\nIdle time: Triggers for auto-shutdown.\nFailure rates: Backend crashes, reconnections.\nUse tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Dynatrace, or cloud-native monitoring to correlate developer efficiency with infrastructure health.\n10. AI agent support – no longer optional\nYour CDE orchestration now has to treat AI agents like first-class citizens, not just humans. That means clean APIs, bulletproof permissions, and tight resource controls. Mistakes here mean you’ll find yourself quickly outdated in a landscape where AI isn’t optional anymore.\nBottom line\nIf you’re clinging to RDP, VDI, manual SSH hacks, or one-off VMs, you’re consciously choosing friction over productivity. Embrace protocol-smart remote dev clients, short-lived environment orchestration, zero-trust security, and meaningful metrics. Whether you adopt CodeCanvas, Coder, Codespaces, Gitpod, or AWS Cloud9 – these patterns aren’t optional if you care about scale, security, and developer velocity.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Fourteen years ago, Dropbox took its first steps toward building its own hardware infrastructure—and as our product and user base has grown, so has our infrastructure. What started with just a handful of servers has evolved into one of the largest custom-built storage systems in the world. We've scaled from a few dozen machines to tens of thousands of servers with millions of drives.\nThat evolution didn’t happen by accident. It took years of iteration, close collaboration with suppliers, and a product-first mindset that treated infrastructure as a strategic advantage. Now we’re excited to share what’s next: the launch of our seventh-generation hardware platform, now featuring Crush, Dexter, and Sonic for our traditional compute, database, and storage workloads, and our newest GPU tiers, Gumby and Godzilla. To make this leap possible, we dramatically increased storage bandwidth, effectively doubled our available rack power, and introduced a next-gen storage chassis designed to even further minimize vibration and heat.\nThis generation represents our most efficient, capable, and scalable architecture yet—and it’ll help us as we continue to build and scale helpful AI products like Dropbox Dash. Below, we’ll walk you through how we designed the latest version of our server hardware as well as key lessons we’ll carry into generations to come.\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019c63112e617513c94_AtlasGrotesk-Medium-Web-vfl38XiTL.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 500;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n\r\n@font-face {\r\nfont-family: 'AtlasGrotesk';\r\nsrc: url('https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65dcd70b48edc3a7b446950e/65dce019711b648fd1ccd24a_AtlasGrotesk-Regular-Web-vflk7bxjs.woff2') format('woff2');\r\nfont-weight: 400;\r\nfont-style: normal;\r\nfont-display: swap;\r\n}\r\n.xf-content-height {margin: 0;}\r\n#cta { font-family: AtlasGrotesk,sans-serif; font-size: .900rem; text-decoration: none; background: #f7f5f2; line-height: 1.69; box-sizing: border-box;}\r\n#cta-box { padding: 15px 20px 15px 20px; }\r\n#cta-hed {font-weight: 500;}\r\n#cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #1e1919; padding-left:20px;}\r\n#cta a:link, #cta a:visited  {text-decoration: none;}\r\n#cta p { margin: 5px 0px 0px 0px; }\r\n\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta {background: #000;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-box {border: 1px solid; border-bottom: 0;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark #cta-indent {border-left: 5px solid #f7f5f2;}\r\n.dr-theme-dark .button {background: #000;}\r\n\r\n.button {\r\n    background-color: #1e1919;\r\n    color:  #f7f5f2;\r\n    height: 2.5rem;\r\n    padding: 10px 5px 10px 20px;\r\n    font-size: 1rem;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    line-height: 1.2;\r\n    transition: all .3s;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.button:hover { background-color: #0061ff; }\r\n\r\nimg {vertical-align: middle; padding: 0px 1px 2px 0px;}\r\n\r\n.c17-plain-html {margin-bottom: 50px}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Dropbox Dash: Find anything. Protect everything.\n\r\n\r\nFind, organize, and protect your work with Dropbox Dash. Now with advanced search for video and images—plus generative AI capabilities across even more connected apps.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nSee what's new →\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n    \nDeveloping our strategy\n\r\n\r\n\n\nTo understand how we got to where we are today, it’s helpful to understand how we built the infrastructure foundation on which Dropbox runs. Back in 2015, we relocated all US customer data from off-premises hosts to on-site ones. The Magic Pocket team executed a massive migration project, bringing the bulk of Dropbox’s file storage into our own custom-built infrastructure. Over 90% of the roughly 600PB of data we stored at the time was moved into data centers we managed ourselves—a turning point that enabled better performance, cost control, and scale.\nIn the years following, we continued to grow—a lot. We ramped from 40PB of storage in 2012 to over 600PB by 2016. And today, we’re in our exabyte era, running on semi-custom hardware that we’ve designed to meet the unique needs of our platform. Along the way, we introduced new technologies such as SMR drives, which allow for higher storage density, and GPU accelerators for AI and compute-heavy tasks. And we’ve co-designed both hardware and software to serve our evolving workloads.\nSo, before committing to any designs for our seventh-generation server hardware, we set some high-level goals that drew from both what we’d learned from previous generations and opportunities from the latest hardware advancements in the industry. Three primary themes shaped our approach:\nEmbracing emerging tech\nInfrastructure hardware is evolving fast. CPUs are getting more powerful with higher core counts and better performance per core. AI workloads are growing rapidly. Networks are moving toward faster speeds like 200G and 400G. And a new band of storage areal density has finally arrived. We used this moment to guide our strategy, aiming to harness these trends to improve our performance, efficiency, and scalability.\nPartnering with suppliers\nStrengthening these relationships also continues to give us a strategic edge: We get earlier access to emerging technology, deeper hardware customization, and a more stable platform. \nDesigning with software in mind\nWe brought in our software teams early to find out what would actually move the needle for their services. That led to goals like packing more compute power into each rack, enabling GPU support for AI and video processing, and improving speed and responsiveness for our database systems. Co-designing was a central theme; we weren’t just designing servers, but building platforms that elevated our services.\nAll of these goals converged around a central question: How big of a leap do we want to make, and what technologies will help get us there? Instead of maxing out everything just because we could, we focused on what matters most: better performance per watt, higher rack-level efficiency, and unlocking the right features to support our next chapter.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1736\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d3d2769c-eb9f-495a-bf58-48c76d953541:Diagram 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1736\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"d3d2769c-eb9f-495a-bf58-48c76d953541:Diagram 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nDropbox seventh-generation hardware\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\n\r\n\r\n    \n A look under the hood of our next-gen hardware\n\r\n\r\n\n\nPerformance\nMaximizing system throughput at the server and rack level\nReducing latency of individual processes\nImproving price-performance for Dropbox workloads\nEnsuring balanced I/O and memory bandwidth \nWe ran tests using SPECintrate (a benchmark for multi-threaded workloads) and compared how each chip stacked up in performance per watt and per core.

At the heart of that upgrade was a shift from the 48-core AMD EPYC 7642 “Rome” processor to the 84-core AMD EPYC 9634 “Genoa.” This shift delivered some big gains:\n75% more cores per socket (48 cores → 84 cores), improving bin packing for containerized services\n2x the memory capacity (256GB → 512GB), boosting memory-heavy workloads\nDDR4 → DDR5, delivering higher bandwidth \n25Gb → 100Gb networking, aligning with growing internal traffic\nNVMe gen5, speeding up local disk access and system boot times\nWe did all of this while keeping the same compact 1U “pizza box” server design, allowing 46 servers per rack, with no extra space needed.\nDatabases\nOn the database side, we focused on boosting CPU performance. While our new Dexter platform keeps the same number of cores as the previous generation, it packs a punch with 30% more instructions per cycle (IPC) and an increased base frequency (from 2.1GHz to 3.25GHz). The shift from dual-socket to single-socket design also reduced delays from inter-socket communication. These upgrades led to up to 3.57x less replication lag—the delay between when data is written to a primary system and when it’s copied to a secondary one—which made a huge difference for high-demand workloads like Dynovault and Edgestore.\nEarly on, we realized our database and compute platforms had a lot in common when it came to requirements. That opened the door for us to use the same platform from our system vendor for both. Consolidating like this helped us simplify our support stack, making it easier to manage components, firmware, drivers, and OS updates. The result was a versatile, dual-use platform that removed key scaling bottlenecks without sacrificing density or efficiency.\nStorage\nFinally, on the storage front, our design goals evolved to keep pace with increasing drive capacities. As drives get bigger—some now hold over 30TB—we had to think ahead. One of our internal performance standards is 30Gbps per PB of data. But with future systems expected to push past 100Gbps, we aimed even higher: 200Gbps throughput. \nWe also reworked our SAS topology to evenly allocate bandwidth to each drive and provide total system bandwidth past 200Gbps. And since this scale demanded stronger networking, we teamed up with our network engineering team to design a new 400G-ready data center architecture.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Thermal and power architecture\n\r\n\r\n\n\nUpgrading to higher-core CPUs meant we had to rethink our approach to thermal and power management. Across the board, we saw power demands rise, so we needed a smarter way to stay within the limits of our existing data center infrastructure. First, we set a cap on processor thermal design power (TDP) to make sure we could pack in as many cores per rack as possible without blowing past our cooling or power budget.\nRather than taking worst-case “nameplate” power measurements—manufacturer-listed maximums that often overestimate real usage—we modeled real-world system usage. The models showed our servers could draw over 16kW per cabinet, which would’ve been a dealbreaker under our old 15kW per-rack power budget. To make it work without overhauling our entire power infrastructure, we teamed up with our data center engineering team and made a major change: We switched from two PDUs to four PDUs per rack, using existing busways and adding more receptacles.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1880\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"61fd1d7e-48bd-4888-936e-768831b0f915:Image 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Image%201.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1880\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"61fd1d7e-48bd-4888-936e-768831b0f915:Image 1.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nSeventh-generation compute and storage (left); quad PDUs to meet higher power requirements (right)\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nThis move effectively doubled our available rack power, giving us the breathing room to support current loads—and even future accelerator cards. Finally, we also worked closely with suppliers to improve airflow, upgrade heatsink designs, optimize fan curves, and test thermals under full-load conditions. It was a full-stack effort to keep things cool and efficient.\nFocus on storage\nOur storage strategy is all about getting more out of the same physical space. We’ve steadily increased the capacity of our traditional 3.5” hard drives from around 14TB to over 30TB in just a few years. This density improvement brings benefits: For one, it lowers cost per terabyte—and also reduces power usage per terabyte.\nHowever, higher densities also heighten sensitivity to acoustic and vibrational interference. And for Dropbox, since over 99% of our storage fleet uses shingled magnetic recording (SMR) technology—which packs data in even tighter—the margin for error is razor-thin.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1748\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"459549f7-af28-4379-bc78-2a38bde3b4ac:Diagram 2.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%202.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1748\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"459549f7-af28-4379-bc78-2a38bde3b4ac:Diagram 2.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nDropbox continues to leap up to the next available areal density curve\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nHere’s the challenge: the read/write head inside these drives operates with nanometer precision. Even a tiny vibration can knock it off track. And when you’ve got fans spinning at over 10,000 RPM to cool a dense server, vibrations (and noise) can quickly stack up. That leads to something called a position error signal (PES)—and, in the worst case, a write fault that forces the drive to retry. That slows things down, increasing latency and reducing IOPS.\nAt the same time, we need that airflow to keep the drives cool. They operate best at around 40°C—and if things get too hot, drives age faster and error rates rise. This means we’re constantly balancing two opposing forces: cool enough to perform, quiet enough to be precise. To solve this, we co-developed our next-gen storage chassis with the system and drive suppliers. The key features we focused on were:\nVibration control: Acoustical isolation and damping \nThermals: Improved fan control and airflow redirection \nFuture-proofing: Compatibility with the next generation of large-capacity drives\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1800\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"688\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5188b6b9-ce1b-46a0-92f6-c9e3a6c3f3c8:pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"1800\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"688\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"5188b6b9-ce1b-46a0-92f6-c9e3a6c3f3c8:pH8djtfC.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nRedirecting high-velocity air to augment cooling\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nThat work paid off. We were one of the first to adopt Western Digital’s Ultrastar HC690, which provides up to a 32TB SMR drive that fits 11 platters into a standard 3.5” casing. That’s more than a 10% bump in capacity compared to the last generation. \nLeveling up with GPUs\nTo support Dash, our universal search and knowledge management product, it was clear we needed to bring GPUs into the mix. Features like intelligent previews, document understanding, fast search, and video processing (plus more recent work with large language models) all require serious computing muscle. \nThese workloads demand high parallelism, massive memory bandwidth, and low-latency interconnects—requirements that traditional CPU-based servers can’t economically support. So as part of our seventh-generation hardware rollout, we introduced two new GPU-enabled server tiers: Gumby and Godzilla.\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n        \r\n            \r\n    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n        <!-- <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1680\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"fcf1e5ff-5a64-4481-b585-38cc69097c36:Diagram 3.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" />\r\n        <img data-sly-test.highRes=\"false\"\r\n             srcset=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png 2x,  1x\"\r\n             src=\"/cms/content/dam/dropbox/tech-blog/en-us/2025/july/7th-gen-hardware/diagrams/Diagram%203.png\"\r\n             aria-hidden=\"\"\r\n             alt=\"\"\r\n             class=\"\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.width=\"2880\"\r\n             data-sly-attribute.height=\"1680\"\r\n             data-aem-asset-id=\"fcf1e5ff-5a64-4481-b585-38cc69097c36:Diagram 3.png\"\r\n             data-trackable=\"true\" /> -->\r\n\r\n        \r\n         \r\n        \r\n    \r\n\r\n            \nGPU generations\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n\nGumby builds on our Crush compute platform but adds support for a wide range of GPU accelerators—hence the flexible name. It’s designed for flexibility, with support for TDPs ranging from 75W to 600W as well as both half-height half-length (HHHL) and full-height full-length (FHFL) PCIe form factors. Gumby is optimized for lightweight inference tasks like video transcoding, embedding generation, and other service-side machine learning enhancements.\nGodzilla is built for big jobs. It supports up to 8 interconnected GPUs, delivering the performance required for LLM testing, fine-tuning, and other high-throughput machine learning workflows.\nTogether, Gumby and Godzilla allow Dropbox to scale AI across our products while maintaining control over performance, cost, and energy efficiency.\nAcross compute, storage, and accelerators, we pushed performance while staying true to our principles: build right-sized, cost-efficient, and optimized systems tailored to our needs. This isn’t just next-gen tech—it’s hardware shaped by how Dropbox actually works.\n\r\n\r\n    \n What we learned along the way\n\r\n\r\n\n\nThermals and power are the new bottlenecks\nNo matter where we looked—compute, storage, or GPU platforms—one thing was clear: power demands are going up. To keep performance scaling, we had to rethink everything from airflow patterns to how power gets delivered at the rack level. That’s what led us to move from two to four PDUs per rack. The result? We can now support more power-hungry, high-density systems without compromising stability or performance. And while overall rack power increased, power consumption per petabyte and per core decreased, helping us stay on track with our sustainability goals.\nSupplier collaboration accelerates innovation\nSome of our biggest hardware wins came from teaming up early with suppliers. Whether it was redesigning hard drive acoustics, fine-tuning chassis layouts, or getting early access to cutting-edge components, collaboration made a huge difference. Instead of waiting for off-the-shelf solutions, we co-developed hardware that fits our needs—like vibration-optimized storage enclosures and systems that are ready for the next generation of storage technology.\nTaking a product-first approach pays off\nThe GPU tier is a prime example of where hardware strategy followed software needs. As AI-powered tools like Dash came online, we engaged early with our machine learning and video teams to understand what was needed. That early input helped us build platforms designed specifically for inference, video processing, and hosting large language models. This product-first mindset ensured the infrastructure was ready the moment the software needed it.\n\r\n\r\n    \nConclusion\n\r\n\r\n\n\nWith our seventh-generation rollout, we’ve made our in-house server hardware more strategically valuable than ever. Our latest Crush and Dexter platforms are powered by cutting-edge CPUs that give us a big lift in performance—especially when it comes to IPC and transaction speed. On the storage side, we worked closely with vendors to develop Sonic, a new system that supports higher capacities. And as demand for AI products continues to grow, we introduced a dedicated hardware tier built specifically for these workloads. \nLooking ahead, we’re already gearing up for the next wave of infrastructure change. Technologies like heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) promise huge capacity gains, and they’ll require us to get even more precise with acoustic and thermal management. Similarly, liquid cooling is transitioning from niche to necessity as compute densities continue to climb.\nThis generation of infrastructure isn’t just about meeting today’s challenges—it’s a launchpad for what’s next. We’ve built tightly integrated platforms optimized for Dropbox, strengthened our supplier partnerships, and created the flexibility to keep evolving. The next generation is already underway.\nSpecial thanks to Jesse Lee and Refugio Fernandez, who also contributed to this story.\n~ ~ ~\nIf building innovative products, experiences, and infrastructure excites you, come build the future with us!

AX900 wifi6 동글들은 대체로 블루투스 기능도 겸하고 있는데, 칩셋을 보면 AIC8800D80, RTL8851BU, RTL8831BU인 경우가 대부분이었다. \n알리익스프레스에서 구입해서 테스트한 AX900 제품은 총 10종류로 아래 사진과 같다. 내장 안테나 버전이 6개, 외장 안테나 버전이 4개이다. 상식적으로 외장 안테나가 달린 동글의 성능이더 좋을거라고 생각했는데, 테스트 결과는 의외로 외장 안테나가 있다고 성능이 더 좋은건 아니였다.\nAX900 WiFi6 USB dongles without external antenna\n\n\n \nAX900 WiFi6 USB dongles with external antenna\n\n\n참고로 이 테스트는 그냥 재미로 해본 것이다. 따라서 일부분 틀린 정보가 있을 수도 있음을 감안해야 한다.\n우선 칩셋에 따른 분류로 AIC8800D80 칩셋, 리얼텍 칩셋을 사용한 경우로 분류해서 살펴보도록 한다.\n \n1. AIC8800D80 칩셋\nAIC8800D80 칩셋을 사용한 제품들은 기본적으로 윈도에 드라이버가 없기 때문에 드라이버를 설치해야만 한다. 드라이버 설치는 희한하게도 USB를 꼽으면 생기는 작은 플래시 외장 디스크가 인식되고, 여기에 10MB 전후의 작은 드라이버 설치 파일이 들어있다. 이를 실행하면 드라이버가 설치된다. 설치 후 바로 인식되는 경우도 있지만 USB를 다시 뽑았다가 끼워야만 인식되기도 한다.\n해당 칩셋을 사용한 제품들은 블루투스 5.3 혹은 블루투스 5.4를 지원한다. 와이파이와 블루투스까지 지원되는 것은 꽤 괜찮은 장점인 것 같다.\n리눅스에서는 github에 있는 드라이버를 직접 빌드해야만 하는데, 커널 버전이 6.x 별로 약간 차이가 있어서 소스 코드를 좀 수정해야만 했다. 이에 대해서는 나중에 시간날 때 따로 쓰도록 하겠다.\nAIC8800D80은 AIC 반도체 회사라는 곳에서 만들었는데, 솔직히 처음 들어본 회사이다. 이번에 동글을 구매하면서 처음 알았다. 전통적으로 무선 칩셋은 Realtek, Mediatek, Intel, Qualcomm 정도가 제일 많이 들어본 회사이고, USB형태로는 거의 리얼텍과 미디어텍이 제일 많이 쓰였었다. AIC는 말레이시아에 있는 회사인거 같은데 솔직히 정보는 별로 없는 듯 하다.\n \n1.1. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #1\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n위 그림의 제품은 성능이 가장 잘 나왔다. 신호 강도도 가장 잘 잡았다. 다만 약간의 발열이 있다. 신호가 쎈만큼 발열이 나오는 것인지는 모르겠다. 이 제품은 연결되면 푸른색 LED가 켜지는 특징이 있다.\n \n1.2. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #2\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품도 성능이 가장 잘 나오는 제품 중에 하나였다. 다만 제품이 약간 길쭉했다. 휴대성 측면에서는 좀 안좋을 것 같기도 했다. 겉 면이 무광에 선이 그어져있는데 의외로 가공면이 고급스러운 느낌을 준다.\n \n1.3. AIC8800D80에서 좋았던 제품 #3\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품도 신호도 잘 잡고 좋았다. 다만 사이즈가 압도적으로 크다. 거의 10cm미터에 육박하는 크기로 다른 제품의 2배 크기였다. 외장 안테나 때문인지 신호는 잘 잡았다. (그러나 앞서 내장 안테나는 쓰는 제품도 신호를 잘 잡는 것으로 봐서 안테나의 차이가 큰 장점은 아닌것 같기도 하다)\n \n1.4. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n해당 모양의 제품은 보통이었다. 이런 모양으로 조금씩 다른 형태가 있었는데 \n \n1.5. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이것도 그냥 보통이었다.\n \n1.6. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n양옆에 굴곡이 있어서 끼우거나 뽑을때 약간 편한 장점이 있지만, 그 외는 대체로 평범했다.\n \n1.7. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\n \nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n외장 안테나가 있지만 신호 강도는 노멀했다.\n \n1.8. AIC8800D80에서 노멀한 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, AIC8800D80 chipset\n\n\n이 제품은 안테나가 4개나 있지만 신호 강도는 그냥 노멀했다. 안테나가 혹시 가짜는 아닐까 하는 의심이 들어서 실제로 분해까지 해봤다. 결과적으로 멀쩡하게 다 연결되어있는데도 신호강호는 이상하게 약했다. 이건 진짜 아리송했다.\n \n \n2. 리얼텍 제품들\n리얼텍은 AX900 동글 제품들에 RTL8851BU 혹은 RTL8831BU 칩셋을 사용하는 경우가 많았다. 전체적으로 리얼텍 칩셋을 사용한 제품이 AIC칩셋 제품보다는 단가가 조금 더 비쌌다. 거의 2배정도의 가격을 형성했다.\n \n2.1. RTL8831BU - 좋은 제품\nAX900 wifi dongle, RTL8831BU chipset\n\n\n이 제품은 Realtek RTL8831BU 칩셋을 사용했으며, 외장 안테나는 1개이다. 나사 방식이라 안테나는 분리가 가능하다. 이 제품도 USB연결시 외장 디스크가 인식되고 그 안에 드라이버가 들어있다. 블루투스 지원은 5.3 버전이고, 리눅스에서 지원은 github에서 받아서 빌드하면 된다. 특징으로는 wifi 동작 방식이 infra와 adhoc 둘다 가능하다는 점이다. 신호 강도고 괜찮고 꽤 쓸만했다.\nDERAPID도 브랜드가 있는 것 같긴 한데, 아마도 FENVI같이 여러 유통경로로 파는 회사가 아닌가 싶기도 하다.\n \n2.2. RTL8851BU - COMFAST 제품 - 별로\n\n\nCOMFAST는 브랜드가 있는 제품인데도 별로였다. 이 제품은 신호강도가 좀 약한 편이었다. 물론 신호강도가 약해도 와이파이 연결에는 문제가 없지만, 속도가 출렁이거나 느려질 수도 있는 단점이 있다. COMFAST 회사 제품은 가장 비쌌지만 가장 신호가 약했다.\n \n \n3. AXE5400 제품 - WIFI6e\nWIFI6e 제품도 있길래 하나 사서 별도로 테스트해봤는데, 그냥 soso했다. 속도는 잘 나오는 편이었다. 칩셋은 RTL8832CU를 사용했으며, 이 제품도 연결하면 USB 외장 디스크가 있고 그 안에 드라이버 설치 파일이 있었다.\nAXE5400 wifi USB dongle, RTL8832CU chipset\n\n\n \n \n4. 총평\n같은 칩셋을 사용해도 신호 강도는 매우 달랐고, 외장 안테나가 있다고 해서 무조건 신호가 쎈 것도 아니였다. 그리고 AIC8800D80 제품들도 의외로 쓸만했고, 리얼텍 제품들은 adhoc을 지원한다는 특징과 좀 더 비싼 가격이 특징이었다.\n \n \n히스토리\n2025.07.06 초고",

AI가 이 모든 과정을 혁신적으로 바꿔놓고 있답니다. 오늘 우리는 증권사 리포트와 주식 차트를 AI가 어떻게 분석하고, 여러분의 투자 의사결정에 얼마나 큰 도움을 줄 수 있는지 알아볼 거예요. 진짜 놀라운 변화가 찾아왔다는 걸 느끼실 겁니다!</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>주식 정보 검색, 왜 AI가 대세일까?  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">최근 미국의 웹 조사 전문업체 시밀러웹의 발표에 따르면, 챗GPT 사용자의 뉴스 관련 검색이 작년 1월 대비 무려 212%나 급증했다고 해요. 여기서 가장 눈에 띄는 부분은, 검색되는 뉴스 카테고리 중 주식과 금융 관련 정보가 각각 33%, 21%로 절반 이상을 차지한다는 점입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 통계는 단순히 뉴스를 찾는 것을 넘어, \"이 뉴스가 주가에 어떤 영향을 줄까?\", \"차트에서 어떤 신호가 나타나는 걸까?\"처럼 보다 심층적인 분석을 AI에게 요구하는 투자자들이 늘고 있다는 의미예요. 아직 대부분의 AI는 단편적인 정보 제공에 그치지만, 투자자들은 이미 AI의 잠재력을 보고 있는 거죠.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  알아두세요!</b><br />AI는 펀더멘탈 분석부터 기술적 분석, 맞춤 전략 제안까지 주식 투자에 필요한 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 도와줄 수 있습니다.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>구글 제미나이가 주식 분석에 특히 유리한 이유  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 상황에서 구글의 제미나이가 주식 정보 분석에 더 유리할 수 있다는 점을 간과할 수 없어요. 왜냐하면 제미나이는 구글이 20년 넘게 축적해온 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">금융 데이터 처리 노하우</span>와 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">검색 알고리즘의 정보 검증 시스템</span>을 그대로 활용할 수 있기 때문이죠. 특히 정확성이 생명인 주식 정보에서는 Google Finance를 통해 쌓아온 금융 데이터 해석 경험이 정말 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 제미나이 2.5의 강력한 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">멀티모달 기능</span>은 일봉, 주봉, 월봉 차트 이미지를 직접 분석할 때 빛을 발합니다. 복잡한 차트에서 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 다양한 보조지표들을 정확하게 인식하고 분석하는 능력이 뛰어나다고 하니, 개인 투자자들에게는 엄청난 기회가 아닐까요?

바로 AI만의 독특한 장점들 때문입니다. AI는 복잡한 재무제표나 기업 정보를 이해하기 쉽게 요약해주고, 여러 정보를 종합적으로 분석해줍니다. 특히 증권사 리포트처럼 전문적인 자료를 초보자도 이해할 수 있는 쉬운 언어로 정리해주어, 상당한 시간과 전문 지식이 필요한 작업을 간소화해주는 효과가 있죠.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">초보자가 가장 어려워하는 차트 분석에서는 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 복잡한 보조지표들을 하나씩 설명하며 현재 상황의 의미를 알려줍니다. 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 종합 분석해 단기와 중장기 관점을 모두 제시하고, \"골든크로스 발생, 특정 가격대 지지\" 등 구체적인 포인트를 안내해 차트 보는 법을 배우는 교육적 효과도 제공한다고 해요. 나아가 투자 성향에 따라 적극적/보수적 전략을 나누어 제안하고, 구체적인 진입가격, 손절선, 목표가까지 제시해 실전에서 바로 활용할 수 있는 실용적인 도움을 주기도 합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  알아두세요!</b><br />AI는 100페이지짜리 기업 보고서를 몇 초 만에 요약해주는 등 정보 분석의 효율성을 극대화합니다. 이는 개인이 감당하기 어려운 정보의 양을 빠르게 처리하여 투자 의사결정을 돕는 데 큰 강점이에요.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>AI 분석 결과의 변동성, 어떻게 이해할까?  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">여기서 한 가지 중요한 점이 있어요. 바로 같은 차트와 문서를 분석해도 매번 결과가 달라질 수 있다는 점입니다. 저도 처음에 좀 당황스러웠는데, 이건 AI의 특성 때문이라고 이해할 수 있어요. AI는 확률적으로 답변을 생성하기 때문에, 같은 질문이라도 조금씩 다른 관점에서 접근할 수 있답니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">생각해보세요. 같은 차트와 기업 보고서를 여러 명의 증권 전문가들에게 보여줘도 각자 다른 분석 결과를 내놓잖아요? 이는 각자가 중요하게 생각하는 지표가 다르고, 시장을 바라보는 관점이 다르기 때문이에요. AI도 마찬가지로 때로는 기술적 분석에 더 무게를 두고, 때로는 펀더멘탈에 더 집중하며, 때로는 리스크 요인을 더 강조할 수 있기에 결과가 달라지는 거죠. 이런 특성을 이해하고 활용한다면, 오히려 다양한 관점에서 종목을 분석해볼 수 있는 장점이 될 수도 있어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이런 이유 때문에, 제가 만든 젬 지침에는 항상 아래와 같은 면책조항을 반드시 추가할 것을 권장드려요. 투자는 결국 본인의 판단과 책임하에 이루어져야 하니까요!</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px; color: #333; margin: 0 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>면책조항: AI 분석 결과 활용 시 주의사항  </b></h3>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0 0 15px 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">AI 분석 결과는 정보 제공 목적으로만 활용되어야 합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">투자 결정은 전적으로 사용자 본인의 판단과 책임 하에 이루어져야 합니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\">AI는 최신 실시간 정보를 즉시 반영하지 못할 수 있으며, 시장의 정성적 요소는 분석에 한계가 있습니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0;\">투자를 진행하기 전에 반드시 해당 기업의 최신 공시, 뉴스, 그리고 전문가의 추가 의견을 직접 확인하시기 바랍니다.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>효율적인 AI 주식 분석, 이렇게 준비하세요!  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI를 활용한 주식 분석의 핵심은 바로 '양질의 데이터'를 제공하는 것입니다. 저는 여러분이 이 젬 지침을 최대한 효과적으로 활용할 수 있도록, 필요한 자료를 어떻게 준비해야 하는지 알려드릴게요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">먼저 네이버 증권에 접속하신 다음, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">리서치 섹션</span>으로 이동하세요. 여기서 종목분석 섹션의 '더보기'를 클릭하고 원하는 종목을 검색한 후, 가장 최근에 나온 리포트 PDF를 다운로드해 주시면 됩니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그 다음은 차트예요. 네이버 증권에서 해당 종목을 검색하고 정보 페이지로 이동한 뒤, '차트' 탭을 선택합니다. 여기서 정말 중요한 건 바로 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">보조지표를 제대로 설정하는 것</span>인데요, 다음 6가지 지표를 꼭 추가해주셔야 합니다.</p>\n<ul style=\"margin: 0 0 15px 20px; padding: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>거래량:</b> 주가 변동의 신뢰도를 확인하는 기본 지표입니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>볼린저 밴드:</b> 주가의 과열/과매도 구간을 판단하는 데 유용해요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>이동평균선:</b> 추세의 방향성과 지지/저항 역할을 확인하는 데 필수적이죠.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>MACD (Moving Average Convergence &amp; Divergence):</b> 단기 및 장기 추세의 변화 시점을 포착하는 데 효과적입니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>RSI (Relative Strength Index):</b> 14일 기준으로 과매수/과매도 상태를 판단하는 지표예요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>DMI (Directional Movement Index):</b> 상승/하락 모멘텀의 강도를 측정하는 데 사용됩니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 6가지 지표를 사용하는 이유는 각각이 서로 다른 관점에서 주가를 분석하기 때문이에요. 거래량은 주가 움직임의 '진정성'을, 볼린저 밴드와 RSI는 단기 과열 여부를, MACD는 추세 전환점을, 이동평균은 중장기 방향성을, DMI는 트렌드의 강도를 알려줍니다. 이 모든 정보가 종합되어야 보다 정확한 매매 타이밍을 잡을 수 있답니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">보조지표 설정이 끝나면 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 각각 적당히 확대해서 보기 좋게 만드신 다음, 인쇄 기능을 이용해서 이미지 파일을 만들어주세요. 총 3개의 차트 이미지가 필요하며, 제미나이가 이해하기 쉽도록 파일명도 '일봉', '주봉', '월봉'으로 해주시면 더 좋습니다. 이제 준비가 끝났습니다! 젬을 실행하고 PDF 파일과 3개의 차트 이미지를 모두 업로드하고 실행(엔터)하시면 됩니다. 이때 리서치 자료 외에 중요한 뉴스와 같은 더 많은 정보를 함께 제공하셔도 좋다는 점 참고하세요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>AI 기반 주식 분석의 실제 활용: '주식전문블로거' 젬  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">제가 직접 개발한 두 번째 젬인 '주식전문블로거'는 여러분이 제공한 기업 정보 PDF와 일봉 차트를 분석하여, 마치 전문 블로거가 쓴 것 같은 완성도 높은 블로그 포스팅을 생성해줍니다. 이 젬 역시 첫 번째 젬과 동일하게 사용자 입력 정보를 등록하며, 차트의 경우 일봉 차트만 등록하시면 됩니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 젬이 만들어주는 결과물은 정말 매력적이에요. 먼저 독자의 관심을 끌 수 있는 블로그 제목부터 시작해서 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">SEO에 최적화된 HTML 형식의 기사</span>를 만들어줍니다. 특히 인상적인 부분은 투자 전략 섹션이에요.

        "contentSnippet": "AI와 함께 스마트한 주식 투자를! 복잡한 증권사 리포트와 차트 분석, 이제 AI가 빠르고 정확하게 도와드립니다. 이 글을 통해 AI 기반 주식 분석의 모든 것을 파헤치고, 여러분의 투자 성공 확률을 높이는 비법을 공개합니다!\n\n\n \n혹시 주식 투자 하시면서 방대한 정보의 바다에서 길을 잃었던 경험 있으신가요? 수십 페이지짜리 증권사 리포트를 읽다가 지쳐버리거나, 복잡한 차트 앞에서 멍하니 서 있었던 적은요? 제가 솔직히 말해서 그랬거든요. 그런데 말이죠, 이제는 그럴 필요가 없어졌어요! AI가 이 모든 과정을 혁신적으로 바꿔놓고 있답니다. 오늘 우리는 증권사 리포트와 주식 차트를 AI가 어떻게 분석하고, 여러분의 투자 의사결정에 얼마나 큰 도움을 줄 수 있는지 알아볼 거예요. 진짜 놀라운 변화가 찾아왔다는 걸 느끼실 겁니다!\n \n주식 정보 검색, 왜 AI가 대세일까?  \n최근 미국의 웹 조사 전문업체 시밀러웹의 발표에 따르면, 챗GPT 사용자의 뉴스 관련 검색이 작년 1월 대비 무려 212%나 급증했다고 해요. 여기서 가장 눈에 띄는 부분은, 검색되는 뉴스 카테고리 중 주식과 금융 관련 정보가 각각 33%, 21%로 절반 이상을 차지한다는 점입니다.\n이 통계는 단순히 뉴스를 찾는 것을 넘어, \"이 뉴스가 주가에 어떤 영향을 줄까?\", \"차트에서 어떤 신호가 나타나는 걸까?\"처럼 보다 심층적인 분석을 AI에게 요구하는 투자자들이 늘고 있다는 의미예요. 아직 대부분의 AI는 단편적인 정보 제공에 그치지만, 투자자들은 이미 AI의 잠재력을 보고 있는 거죠.\n  알아두세요!\nAI는 펀더멘탈 분석부터 기술적 분석, 맞춤 전략 제안까지 주식 투자에 필요한 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 도와줄 수 있습니다.\n \n구글 제미나이가 주식 분석에 특히 유리한 이유  \n이런 상황에서 구글의 제미나이가 주식 정보 분석에 더 유리할 수 있다는 점을 간과할 수 없어요. 왜냐하면 제미나이는 구글이 20년 넘게 축적해온 금융 데이터 처리 노하우와 검색 알고리즘의 정보 검증 시스템을 그대로 활용할 수 있기 때문이죠. 특히 정확성이 생명인 주식 정보에서는 Google Finance를 통해 쌓아온 금융 데이터 해석 경험이 정말 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.\n게다가 제미나이 2.5의 강력한 멀티모달 기능은 일봉, 주봉, 월봉 차트 이미지를 직접 분석할 때 빛을 발합니다. 복잡한 차트에서 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 다양한 보조지표들을 정확하게 인식하고 분석하는 능력이 뛰어나다고 하니, 개인 투자자들에게는 엄청난 기회가 아닐까요? 심지어 이 모든 기능을 무료로도 충분히 사용할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적이에요.\nAI 주식 분석, 얼마나 정확할까?\n구분\n설명\nAI 강점\n인간 전문가 강점\n\n\n\n\n정보 해석\n방대한 데이터 요약 및 분석\n속도, 대규모 데이터 처리\n직관, 비정형 정보 해석\n\n\n차트 분석\n보조지표 해석 및 추세 파악\n객관적인 지표 분석\n패턴 인식, 미묘한 변화 감지\n\n\n전략 수립\n투자 성향별 맞춤 전략\n일관된 논리, 빠른 시뮬레이션\n시장 심리, 경험적 판단\n\n\n최신 정보 반영\n업로드된 자료 기반 분석\n제공된 정보 내에서는 완벽\n실시간 뉴스, 공시 파악\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nAI 분석은 업로드된 자료를 기반으로 하기에 최신 뉴스나 공시 정보가 즉시 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 또, 차트 이미지 화질이 좋지 않으면 분석 정확도가 떨어질 수 있으니, 항상 고화질 이미지를 사용해야 합니다.\n \nAI 주식 분석, 활용법과 한계점 깊이 보기  ‍ ‍ \n그럼에도 불구하고 왜 많은 사람들이 AI를 활용해서 주식 정보를 찾으려 할까요? 바로 AI만의 독특한 장점들 때문입니다. AI는 복잡한 재무제표나 기업 정보를 이해하기 쉽게 요약해주고, 여러 정보를 종합적으로 분석해줍니다. 특히 증권사 리포트처럼 전문적인 자료를 초보자도 이해할 수 있는 쉬운 언어로 정리해주어, 상당한 시간과 전문 지식이 필요한 작업을 간소화해주는 효과가 있죠.\n초보자가 가장 어려워하는 차트 분석에서는 이동평균선, MACD, RSI 같은 복잡한 보조지표들을 하나씩 설명하며 현재 상황의 의미를 알려줍니다. 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 종합 분석해 단기와 중장기 관점을 모두 제시하고, \"골든크로스 발생, 특정 가격대 지지\" 등 구체적인 포인트를 안내해 차트 보는 법을 배우는 교육적 효과도 제공한다고 해요. 나아가 투자 성향에 따라 적극적/보수적 전략을 나누어 제안하고, 구체적인 진입가격, 손절선, 목표가까지 제시해 실전에서 바로 활용할 수 있는 실용적인 도움을 주기도 합니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI는 100페이지짜리 기업 보고서를 몇 초 만에 요약해주는 등 정보 분석의 효율성을 극대화합니다. 이는 개인이 감당하기 어려운 정보의 양을 빠르게 처리하여 투자 의사결정을 돕는 데 큰 강점이에요.\n \nAI 분석 결과의 변동성, 어떻게 이해할까?  \n여기서 한 가지 중요한 점이 있어요. 바로 같은 차트와 문서를 분석해도 매번 결과가 달라질 수 있다는 점입니다. 저도 처음에 좀 당황스러웠는데, 이건 AI의 특성 때문이라고 이해할 수 있어요. AI는 확률적으로 답변을 생성하기 때문에, 같은 질문이라도 조금씩 다른 관점에서 접근할 수 있답니다.\n생각해보세요. 같은 차트와 기업 보고서를 여러 명의 증권 전문가들에게 보여줘도 각자 다른 분석 결과를 내놓잖아요? 이는 각자가 중요하게 생각하는 지표가 다르고, 시장을 바라보는 관점이 다르기 때문이에요. AI도 마찬가지로 때로는 기술적 분석에 더 무게를 두고, 때로는 펀더멘탈에 더 집중하며, 때로는 리스크 요인을 더 강조할 수 있기에 결과가 달라지는 거죠. 이런 특성을 이해하고 활용한다면, 오히려 다양한 관점에서 종목을 분석해볼 수 있는 장점이 될 수도 있어요.\n이런 이유 때문에, 제가 만든 젬 지침에는 항상 아래와 같은 면책조항을 반드시 추가할 것을 권장드려요. 투자는 결국 본인의 판단과 책임하에 이루어져야 하니까요!\n면책조항: AI 분석 결과 활용 시 주의사항  \nAI 분석 결과는 정보 제공 목적으로만 활용되어야 합니다.\n투자 결정은 전적으로 사용자 본인의 판단과 책임 하에 이루어져야 합니다.\nAI는 최신 실시간 정보를 즉시 반영하지 못할 수 있으며, 시장의 정성적 요소는 분석에 한계가 있습니다.\n투자를 진행하기 전에 반드시 해당 기업의 최신 공시, 뉴스, 그리고 전문가의 추가 의견을 직접 확인하시기 바랍니다.\n \n효율적인 AI 주식 분석, 이렇게 준비하세요!  \nAI를 활용한 주식 분석의 핵심은 바로 '양질의 데이터'를 제공하는 것입니다. 저는 여러분이 이 젬 지침을 최대한 효과적으로 활용할 수 있도록, 필요한 자료를 어떻게 준비해야 하는지 알려드릴게요.\n먼저 네이버 증권에 접속하신 다음, 리서치 섹션으로 이동하세요. 여기서 종목분석 섹션의 '더보기'를 클릭하고 원하는 종목을 검색한 후, 가장 최근에 나온 리포트 PDF를 다운로드해 주시면 됩니다.\n그 다음은 차트예요. 네이버 증권에서 해당 종목을 검색하고 정보 페이지로 이동한 뒤, '차트' 탭을 선택합니다. 여기서 정말 중요한 건 바로 보조지표를 제대로 설정하는 것인데요, 다음 6가지 지표를 꼭 추가해주셔야 합니다.\n거래량: 주가 변동의 신뢰도를 확인하는 기본 지표입니다.\n볼린저 밴드: 주가의 과열/과매도 구간을 판단하는 데 유용해요.\n이동평균선: 추세의 방향성과 지지/저항 역할을 확인하는 데 필수적이죠.\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence & Divergence): 단기 및 장기 추세의 변화 시점을 포착하는 데 효과적입니다.\nRSI (Relative Strength Index): 14일 기준으로 과매수/과매도 상태를 판단하는 지표예요.\nDMI (Directional Movement Index): 상승/하락 모멘텀의 강도를 측정하는 데 사용됩니다.\n이 6가지 지표를 사용하는 이유는 각각이 서로 다른 관점에서 주가를 분석하기 때문이에요. 거래량은 주가 움직임의 '진정성'을, 볼린저 밴드와 RSI는 단기 과열 여부를, MACD는 추세 전환점을, 이동평균은 중장기 방향성을, DMI는 트렌드의 강도를 알려줍니다. 이 모든 정보가 종합되어야 보다 정확한 매매 타이밍을 잡을 수 있답니다.\n보조지표 설정이 끝나면 일봉, 주봉, 월봉을 각각 적당히 확대해서 보기 좋게 만드신 다음, 인쇄 기능을 이용해서 이미지 파일을 만들어주세요. 총 3개의 차트 이미지가 필요하며, 제미나이가 이해하기 쉽도록 파일명도 '일봉', '주봉', '월봉'으로 해주시면 더 좋습니다. 이제 준비가 끝났습니다! 젬을 실행하고 PDF 파일과 3개의 차트 이미지를 모두 업로드하고 실행(엔터)하시면 됩니다. 이때 리서치 자료 외에 중요한 뉴스와 같은 더 많은 정보를 함께 제공하셔도 좋다는 점 참고하세요.\n \nAI 기반 주식 분석의 실제 활용: '주식전문블로거' 젬  \n제가 직접 개발한 두 번째 젬인 '주식전문블로거'는 여러분이 제공한 기업 정보 PDF와 일봉 차트를 분석하여, 마치 전문 블로거가 쓴 것 같은 완성도 높은 블로그 포스팅을 생성해줍니다. 이 젬 역시 첫 번째 젬과 동일하게 사용자 입력 정보를 등록하며, 차트의 경우 일봉 차트만 등록하시면 됩니다.\n이 젬이 만들어주는 결과물은 정말 매력적이에요. 먼저 독자의 관심을 끌 수 있는 블로그 제목부터 시작해서 SEO에 최적화된 HTML 형식의 기사를 만들어줍니다. 특히 인상적인 부분은 투자 전략 섹션이에요.

현대 사회에서 스마트폰은 단순한 소통 도구를 넘어, 우리 삶의 중심에서 개인 비서 역할을 톡톡히 하고 있습니다. 그리고 그 핵심에는 바로 '인공지능 어시스턴트'가 자리 잡고 있죠. 그런데 시중에 워낙 다양한 AI 어시스턴트들이 많다 보니, 어떤 것을 선택해야 할지 고민이 되실 거예요. 그래서 제가 직접 안드로이드 기반의 대표적인 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트, 즉 Bixby, ChatGPT, Perplexity, 그리고 Gemini를 심층적으로 사용해보며 각자의 장단점을 분석해봤습니다. 과연 어떤 어시스턴트가 당신의 일상에 진정한 '내 사람'이 될 수 있을까요?  </p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>Bixby: 삼성 기기 사용자만을 위한 맞춤형 조력자  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">삼성 갤럭시 스마트폰에 기본적으로 탑재되어 있는 Bixby는 종종 그 잠재력을 간과하기 쉽습니다. 저 또한 처음에는 단순한 음성 명령 기능 정도로만 여겼죠. 하지만 직접 시간을 투자하여 사용해보니 예상보다 훨씬 강력한 기기 통합 능력을 지녔다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제 Galaxy A72에서 테스트했을 때, 설정 변경, 앱 실행, SmartThings 기기 제어 등 스마트폰 시스템 전반과의 연동성이 매우 뛰어났습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>  주목할 만한 기능!</b><br />\"Hi Bixby\"와 같은 호출어(wake word)를 통해 핸즈프리로 실행할 수 있다는 점은 일상생활 속에서 상당한 편리함을 제공합니다. 예를 들어, \"야간 카메라 모드 열어줘\"라고 말하면 해당 카메라 앱을 즉시 실행하고, 심지어 장노출 촬영 설정까지 안내해주는 등 실질적인 작업 수행을 돕는 능력이 탁월했습니다.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그러나 삼성 앱 생태계를 벗어난 영역에서는 그 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 복잡한 정보 질의나 개방형 대화에서는 다른 범용 AI 어시스턴트들에 비해 다소 약한 모습을 보였습니다. 여전히 '명령 중심'의 인공지능이라는 점에서, 유연한 대화를 통한 정보 탐색보다는 특정 기능 실행에 최적화되어 있다고 할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #f44336; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\"><b>⚠️ Bixby 사용 시 유의점!</b><br />Bixby는 삼성 기기 및 SmartThings 생태계에 깊이 연동되어 있어 이 외의 사용 환경에서는 기능이 제한적일 수 있습니다.</div>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>ChatGPT: 언어 지능은 최강, 그러나 손이 가는 AI  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">ChatGPT는 명확하게 말해, 스마트폰 기기 제어보다는 언어 이해 및 생성 능력에 특화된 어시스턴트입니다. 복잡한 질문에도 맥락을 정확히 파악하여 답변하고, 후속 질문에도 능수능란하게 대응하는 모습은 가히 독보적입니다. 창의적인 아이디어 구상, 글쓰기 보조, 긴 텍스트 요약 등 언어 기반 작업에서는 최강의 능력을 보여줍니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">하지만 스마트폰 운영체제(OS)와의 연동성 측면에서는 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 호출어(wake word)가 없기 때문에 음성만으로는 어시스턴트를 실행할 수 없으며, 수동으로 앱을 열어야 하는 번거로움이 있습니다. 또한, Wi-Fi 끄기나 일정 확인과 같은 OS와 직접 연동된 스마트폰 기능은 ChatGPT가 직접 제어하기 어렵습니다. 예를 들어, \"Wi-Fi 꺼줘\"라고 명령하면, 실제로 Wi-Fi를 끄는 대신 그 방법을 설명해주는 식입니다. 음성으로 전달받은 결과도 대부분 ChatGPT 앱 내부에서만 확인할 수 있어, 다른 어시스턴트들처럼 '즉각적으로 화면에 반응하는' 경험을 기대하긴 어렵습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>Perplexity: 숨겨진 멀티태스킹 강자, 지능형 정보 탐색가  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">Perplexity는 ChatGPT만큼 대중적인 인지도는 없지만, 실제 사용 환경에서는 놀라운 경쟁력을 보여주었습니다. 가장 인상 깊었던 점은 질문의 흐름을 자연스럽게 이어가며 처리하는 능력과 다양한 앱과의 연동성이었습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"주변 맛집 추천해줘\"라고 질문한 뒤, \"그럼 도보 거리에 있는 곳으로만 좁혀줘\", 그리고 마지막으로 \"선택한 식당 정보를 친구에게 문자로 보내줘\"와 같은 다단계 요청을 중간에 끊김 없이 유연하게 처리해냈습니다. 이는 Perplexity가 단순한 질문-답변 AI를 넘어, 사용자의 복합적인 작업 지시를 이해하고 해결해주는 진정한 '도우미'로서의 강점을 보여주는 사례입니다. 또한, Uber 실행 시 목적지를 자동으로 입력해주거나, Spotify를 실행하여 사용자가 원하는 음악을 재생하는 등 앱 연동 기능도 매우 원활하게 작동했습니다. 이처럼 Perplexity는 단순 검색을 넘어 실생활 자동화에 한 발 더 다가선 느낌이었습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

        "contentSnippet": "스마트폰 인공지능 비서, 당신의 일상을 혁신할 최적의 파트너는? 대표 안드로이드 AI 어시스턴트 4종의 면밀한 비교를 통해, 당신에게 딱 맞는 디지털 동반자를 찾아드립니다.\n스마트폰 AI 어시스턴트 심층 분석\n\n\n \n  현대 사회에서 스마트폰은 단순한 소통 도구를 넘어, 우리 삶의 중심에서 개인 비서 역할을 톡톡히 하고 있습니다. 그리고 그 핵심에는 바로 '인공지능 어시스턴트'가 자리 잡고 있죠. 그런데 시중에 워낙 다양한 AI 어시스턴트들이 많다 보니, 어떤 것을 선택해야 할지 고민이 되실 거예요. 그래서 제가 직접 안드로이드 기반의 대표적인 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트, 즉 Bixby, ChatGPT, Perplexity, 그리고 Gemini를 심층적으로 사용해보며 각자의 장단점을 분석해봤습니다. 과연 어떤 어시스턴트가 당신의 일상에 진정한 '내 사람'이 될 수 있을까요?  \n \nBixby: 삼성 기기 사용자만을 위한 맞춤형 조력자  \n삼성 갤럭시 스마트폰에 기본적으로 탑재되어 있는 Bixby는 종종 그 잠재력을 간과하기 쉽습니다. 저 또한 처음에는 단순한 음성 명령 기능 정도로만 여겼죠. 하지만 직접 시간을 투자하여 사용해보니 예상보다 훨씬 강력한 기기 통합 능력을 지녔다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제 Galaxy A72에서 테스트했을 때, 설정 변경, 앱 실행, SmartThings 기기 제어 등 스마트폰 시스템 전반과의 연동성이 매우 뛰어났습니다.\n  주목할 만한 기능!\n\"Hi Bixby\"와 같은 호출어(wake word)를 통해 핸즈프리로 실행할 수 있다는 점은 일상생활 속에서 상당한 편리함을 제공합니다. 예를 들어, \"야간 카메라 모드 열어줘\"라고 말하면 해당 카메라 앱을 즉시 실행하고, 심지어 장노출 촬영 설정까지 안내해주는 등 실질적인 작업 수행을 돕는 능력이 탁월했습니다.\n \n그러나 삼성 앱 생태계를 벗어난 영역에서는 그 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 복잡한 정보 질의나 개방형 대화에서는 다른 범용 AI 어시스턴트들에 비해 다소 약한 모습을 보였습니다. 여전히 '명령 중심'의 인공지능이라는 점에서, 유연한 대화를 통한 정보 탐색보다는 특정 기능 실행에 최적화되어 있다고 할 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ Bixby 사용 시 유의점!\nBixby는 삼성 기기 및 SmartThings 생태계에 깊이 연동되어 있어 이 외의 사용 환경에서는 기능이 제한적일 수 있습니다.\n \nChatGPT: 언어 지능은 최강, 그러나 손이 가는 AI  \nChatGPT는 명확하게 말해, 스마트폰 기기 제어보다는 언어 이해 및 생성 능력에 특화된 어시스턴트입니다. 복잡한 질문에도 맥락을 정확히 파악하여 답변하고, 후속 질문에도 능수능란하게 대응하는 모습은 가히 독보적입니다. 창의적인 아이디어 구상, 글쓰기 보조, 긴 텍스트 요약 등 언어 기반 작업에서는 최강의 능력을 보여줍니다.\n하지만 스마트폰 운영체제(OS)와의 연동성 측면에서는 한계가 명확하게 드러났습니다. 호출어(wake word)가 없기 때문에 음성만으로는 어시스턴트를 실행할 수 없으며, 수동으로 앱을 열어야 하는 번거로움이 있습니다. 또한, Wi-Fi 끄기나 일정 확인과 같은 OS와 직접 연동된 스마트폰 기능은 ChatGPT가 직접 제어하기 어렵습니다. 예를 들어, \"Wi-Fi 꺼줘\"라고 명령하면, 실제로 Wi-Fi를 끄는 대신 그 방법을 설명해주는 식입니다. 음성으로 전달받은 결과도 대부분 ChatGPT 앱 내부에서만 확인할 수 있어, 다른 어시스턴트들처럼 '즉각적으로 화면에 반응하는' 경험을 기대하긴 어렵습니다.\n✅ 강점: 대화형 지능, 창의적 사고, 텍스트 작업에 압도적인 강점.\n❌ 약점: 음성 호출 미지원, 스마트폰 기본 기능 제어의 어려움, 제한적인 앱 연동성.\n \nPerplexity: 숨겨진 멀티태스킹 강자, 지능형 정보 탐색가  \nPerplexity는 ChatGPT만큼 대중적인 인지도는 없지만, 실제 사용 환경에서는 놀라운 경쟁력을 보여주었습니다. 가장 인상 깊었던 점은 질문의 흐름을 자연스럽게 이어가며 처리하는 능력과 다양한 앱과의 연동성이었습니다.\n예를 들어, \"주변 맛집 추천해줘\"라고 질문한 뒤, \"그럼 도보 거리에 있는 곳으로만 좁혀줘\", 그리고 마지막으로 \"선택한 식당 정보를 친구에게 문자로 보내줘\"와 같은 다단계 요청을 중간에 끊김 없이 유연하게 처리해냈습니다. 이는 Perplexity가 단순한 질문-답변 AI를 넘어, 사용자의 복합적인 작업 지시를 이해하고 해결해주는 진정한 '도우미'로서의 강점을 보여주는 사례입니다. 또한, Uber 실행 시 목적지를 자동으로 입력해주거나, Spotify를 실행하여 사용자가 원하는 음악을 재생하는 등 앱 연동 기능도 매우 원활하게 작동했습니다. 이처럼 Perplexity는 단순 검색을 넘어 실생활 자동화에 한 발 더 다가선 느낌이었습니다.\n✅ 강점: 복합적인 다단계 작업 처리 능력, 뛰어난 앱 연동성, 심층적인 정보 탐색 및 요약 능력.\n❌ 약점: 음성 호출어 미지원으로 인한 핸즈프리 제어 불가, 상대적으로 낮은 대중적 인지도로 인한 추가 기능 확장성 미지수.\n \nGemini: 구글 생태계의 핵심, 가장 균형 잡힌 차세대 비서  \nGoogle Assistant의 진화형인 Gemini는 제가 체험한 어시스턴트 중 가장 균형 잡힌 성능을 보여주었습니다. 기존 \"Hey Google\"이라는 호출어가 그대로 유지되어 핸즈프리 사용이 가능했으며, Gmail, Google Keep, Google Calendar 등 구글 서비스 전반과의 통합이 매우 뛰어났습니다.\n예를 들어, \"Nathan이 보낸 이메일 보여줘\"라고 요청하면 해당 이메일의 핵심 내용을 요약하여 홈 화면에 바로 표시해주는 등, 구글 앱과의 긴밀한 연동이 돋보였습니다. 또한, 음성으로 쇼핑 목록을 요청하면 Google Keep에 자동으로 항목들을 정리해주는 기능은 실질적인 활용도 면에서 매우 강력했습니다. 이러한 연동성과 자동화 기능은 일상생활의 효율성을 크게 높여주었습니다.\n✅ 강점: 음성 호출어 사용 가능, 구글 앱 및 서비스와의 완벽하고 깊은 연동, 자연어 처리 능력 향상, 전반적으로 균형 잡힌 기능 제공.\n❌ 약점: 간헐적으로 응답 속도 저하 현상 발생, 모든 요청에 대한 완벽한 이해 부족 (발전 중).\n \n총평: 당신의 AI 어시스턴트, 누구를 선택하시겠습니까?  \n이번 비교 체험을 통해 네 가지 AI 어시스턴트가 각기 다른 강점과 지향점을 가지고 있다는 것을 명확히 알 수 있었습니다. 결국 최적의 선택은 사용자의 주된 목적과 스마트폰 활용 방식에 따라 달라질 것입니다. 아래 표를 통해 당신의 AI 어시스턴트 선택에 도움이 되는 기준을 제시해 드립니다.\n사용 목적\n추천 어시스턴트\n\n\n\n\n삼성 기기와의 깊은 통합 및 제어\nBixby\n\n\n창의적 글쓰기, 정보 요약, 심층 대화\nChatGPT\n\n\n복합적인 다단계 작업 처리, 다양한 앱 연동 자동화\nPerplexity\n\n\n전반적인 일상 지원 및 구글 서비스와의 완벽한 연동\nGemini\n\n\n\n개인적인 최종 선택은 Gemini였습니다. 완벽하다고는 할 수 없지만, 가장 다양한 상황에서 안정적인 성능을 보여주었으며, 제가 이미 깊이 사용하고 있는 구글 서비스들과의 자연스러운 연동성은 실제 생활에서의 활용도를 압도적으로 높여주었기 때문입니다.\n \n마무리하며: 나의 일상을 책임질 디지털 동료  \n이제 AI 어시스턴트는 단순한 음성 명령 처리 도구를 넘어, 사용자의 일상에 깊이 관여하며 삶의 질을 높여주는 '디지털 동료'로 진화하고 있습니다. 중요한 것은 '가장 똑똑한 AI'를 쫓기보다는, '나의 생활 방식과 습관에 가장 잘 들어맞는 AI'를 발견하는 것이겠죠.\n당신의 스마트폰 어시스턴트, 과연 누구와 함께 스마트한 미래를 만들어갈 준비가 되셨나요?

Firefly, DALL·E, Midjourney는 익숙하지만, Google Labs에 조용히 숨어있는 진짜 강력한 도구가 있습니다. 바로 'ImageFX'입니다. 이 글에서 그 놀라운 성능과 활용법, 프롬프트 예시까지 모두 확인해보세요!\n미드저니 대체 무료 AI? 구글 ImageFX 잠재력과 프롬프트 완전 정복\n\n\n \n 다양한 AI 이미지 생성기를 사용해 보셨을 겁니다. 화려한 기능과 광고 속에서 어떤 걸 써야 할지 고민될 때가 많죠. 저도 그랬으니까요. 그런데 최근에 우연히, 마치 비밀 연구소에 숨겨진 보물처럼 조용하지만 강력한 성능을 자랑하는 도구를 발견했습니다. 바로 구글의 ImageFX입니다. 과대광고 없이, 오직 결과물로만 이야기하는 이 도구에 대해 솔직한 후기를 공유해 드릴게요.  \n \n구글의 숨겨진 보석, ImageFX ✨\n구글이 AI 분야의 강자라는 건 모두가 아는 사실이지만, 이상하게도 ImageFX는 전면에 나서지 않습니다. 이 도구는 구글의 가장 실험적인 프로젝트를 선보이는 'AI Test Kitchen'의 일부로, 홈페이지에서 직접 찾아 들어가야만 만날 수 있죠. 하지만 일단 사용해보면, 왜 구글이 자신감을 가졌는지 알 수 있습니다.\nImageFX는 구글의 최신 모델인 Imagen 3를 기반으로 작동합니다. 다른 AI들이 화려하고 예술적인 스타일에 집중할 때, ImageFX는 '사실감'과 '정확성'이라는 기본에 충실합니다. 놀라운 점은 유료 요금제나 광고 없이 이 모든 기능을 무료로 제공한다는 것이죠.\n \nImageFX 시작하기: 5단계 완전 정복  ‍ \n\"그래서 어떻게 사용하는 건데?\" 하고 궁금해하실 분들을 위해 준비했습니다. 구글 계정만 있다면 누구나 단 5단계 만에 전문가 수준의 이미지를 만들 수 있습니다. 아래 가이드를 따라 차근차근 시작해보세요.\n단계별 ImageFX 사용 가이드  \n사이트 방문: http://labs.google/fx/tools/image-fx\nImageFX 선택 및 로그인: 화면에 보이는 여러 실험 도구 중 'ImageFX'를 선택하고, 본인의 구글 계정으로 로그인합니다.\n프롬프트 입력: 만들고 싶은 이미지에 대한 설명을 텍스트 입력창에 자유롭게 입력합니다. (예: \"해변에서 책을 읽고 있는 골든 리트리버\") : 최적의 결과를 위해서는 영문 프롬프트를 권장합니다.\n프롬프트 칩으로 다듬기: 프롬프트를 입력하면 하단에 [Cinematic], [35mm film], [Minimalist] 등 다양한 스타일의 '칩'이 나타납니다. 원하는 칩을 클릭하여 결과물을 더 세밀하게 다듬어 보세요.\n결과 확인 및 다운로드: 잠시 기다리면 4개의 이미지가 생성됩니다. 마음에 드는 이미지를 클릭하여 더 크게 보고, 다운로드 버튼을 눌러 저장하면 끝!\n \nImageFX 맞춤 프롬프트, 이렇게 써보세요! ✍️\nImageFX의 진정한 힘은 '현실 세계를 묘사하는' 프롬프트와 만났을 때 발휘됩니다. 추상적인 단어보다는 구체적인 상황, 조명, 재질을 묘사하면 훨씬 더 사실적인 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다. 아래 예시들을 참고하여 여러분만의 프롬프트를 만들어보세요.\n  인물 사진 프롬프트\nPrompt: A close-up portrait of an elderly female artisan meticulously painting pottery, her face shows intense concentration. Soft window light illuminates her grey hair and workshop. Shallow depth of field.\n(한글: 나이 든 여성 장인이 도자기에 세심하게 그림을 그리는 클로즈업 인물 사진. 그녀의 얼굴에는 깊은 집중력이 드러난다. 부드러운 창가의 빛이 그녀의 흰머리와 작업실을 비춘다. 얕은 피사계 심도.)\n\n\n \n ️ 풍경/배경 프롬프트\nPrompt: A wide-angle shot of a quiet library with towering wooden bookshelves filled with old books. sunbeams shining through a large arched window, dust particles floating in the air. Warm and nostalgic tones.\n(한글: 오래된 책으로 가득 찬 높은 나무 책장이 있는 조용한 도서관의 광각 사진. 커다란 아치형 창문으로 햇살이 들어오고, 공기 중에는 먼지 입자가 떠다닌다. 따뜻하고 향수를 불러일으키는 톤.)\n\n\n \n ️ 자연의 섬세함 \nPrompt: A photo focused on the wing of a butterfly resting on a colorful flower. The delicate patterns and textures of the translucent wing shimmer in the sunlight. Soft background blur, vivid colors, shallow depth of field. \n(한글: 화려한 꽃 위에 앉아있는 나비의 날개에 초점을 맞춘 사진. 반투명한 날개의 섬세한 무늬와 질감이 햇빛에 비쳐 반짝인다. 부드러운 배경 흐림, 생생한 색감, 얕은 피사계 심도. .)\n\n\n \n ️ 아늑한 실내 풍경 \nPrompt: A cozy and peaceful scene of a cat sleeping on a rocking chair next to a warm fireplace, covered with a fluffy blanket. The firelight gently illuminates the cat's fur. Realistic texture, warm and inviting tones. \n(한글: 따뜻한 벽난로 옆, 푹신한 담요가 덮인 흔들의자에 고양이 한 마리가 잠들어 있다. 벽난로의 불빛이 고양이의 털을 부드럽게 비추고 있다. 아늑하고 평화로운 분위기, 사실적인 텍스처.)\n\n\n \n☕ 사물/제품 프롬프트\nPrompt: A macro photograph of a steaming cup of black coffee on a rustic wooden table. A single drop of condensation trickles down the side of the ceramic mug. hyper-realistic, high detail.\n(한글: 러스틱한 나무 테이블 위에 놓인 김이 나는 블랙커피 한 잔의 매크로 사진. 세라믹 머그잔 옆으로 응결된 물방울 하나가 흘러내린다. 극사실주의, 고화질.)\n\n\n\n \nImageFX, 이런 분들께 추천해요!  \nImageFX는 모든 사람에게 유용한 도구이지만, 특히 다음과 같은 분들께 강력히 추천합니다. 여러분의 작업 효율을 극적으로 높여줄 거예요.\n콘텐츠 제작자/마케터: SNS 게시물, 블로그 썸네일, 광고 소재 등 사실적인 이미지가 필요할 때 저작권 걱정 없이 빠르게 고품질 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n디자이너/기획자: 아이디어 구체화 단계에서 레퍼런스 이미지나 시안을 신속하게 제작하여 커뮤니케이션 비용을 줄일 수 있습니다.\n학생/연구원: 프레젠테이션, 보고서, 논문에 필요한 시각 자료를 비용 부담 없이 만들 수 있어 학업의 질을 높일 수 있습니다.\nAI 입문자/취미 사용자: 복잡한 설정 없이 직관적인 인터페이스와 '프롬프트 칩' 기능으로 누구나 쉽고 재미있게 AI 이미지 생성을 경험할 수 있습니다.\n \n유료 모델을 위협하는 사실감  \nAI 이미지의 '티'가 나는 결과물에 실망한 적 있으신가요? ImageFX는 조명, 재질, 구도 표현에서 놀라운 사실감을 보여줍니다. 마치 전문 포토그래퍼가 촬영한 사진처럼 말이죠.\n요소\nImageFX 표현력\n\n\n\n\n조명\n강한 조명, 부드러운 조명, 골든 아워 등 실제 빛의 느낌을 정확하게 재현합니다.\n\n\n재질\n유리의 투명함, 금속의 반사, 피부의 유기적인 질감을 사실적으로 표현합니다.\n\n\n구도\n별다른 지시 없이도 안정적이고 균형 잡힌 구도를 자동으로 만들어냅니다.\n\n\n\n⚠️ 물론 한계도 있어요!\n모든 도구가 완벽할 순 없겠죠. ImageFX는 로고나 간판처럼 이미지 속 텍스트 생성에는 약한 모습을 보입니다. 또한, 초현실적이거나 특정 작가의 화풍을 강하게 따라하는 스타일 표현에는 다소 제한적일 수 있습니다. 하지만 무료라는 점을 감안하면 기대 이상의 성능입니다.\n \n \nImageFX 핵심 요약\n✨ 압도적 사실감: 별도 보정 없이 바로 사용 가능한 사진 수준의 결과물\n  직관적인 사용법: 프롬프트 칩 기능으로 누구나 쉽게 아이디어 확장 가능\n  100% 무료:\n광고나 유료 플랜 없이 모든 기능을 무료로 제공\n✍️ 맞춤 프롬프트: 구체적이고 서술적인 프롬프트로 최고의 결과물 도출\n조용하지만 가장 강력한 무료 이미지 생성기, 지금 바로 경험해보세요.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: ImageFX는 정말 무료인가요?\nA: 네, 현재 ImageFX는 구글의 AI Test Kitchen을 통해 별도의 비용이나 구독 없이 무료로 제공되고 있습니다.\nQ: ImageFX로 만든 이미지의 상업적 이용이 가능한가요?\nA: 현재 구글의 공식 약관에는 상업적 이용에 대한 명확한 허용 지침이 나와 있지 않습니다. 따라서 중요한 상업적 프로젝트에 사용하기보다는 개인적인 실험이나 비상업적 용도로 사용하는 것이 안전합니다. 항상 최신 이용 약관을 확인하는 것을 권장합니다.\nQ: Midjourney나 DALL·E와 비교했을 때 가장 큰 차이점은 무엇인가요?\nA: 가장 큰 차이점은 '사실감'에 대한 집중도와 '프롬프트 칩' 기능입니다.

        "contentSnippet": "챗GPT 장애 보상: 월 구독료 6.4% 환불, 당신도 대상일까요? 지난달 오픈AI 챗GPT 서비스에서 발생한 일시 오류에 대한 보상이 시작되었습니다. 과연 어떤 기준으로, 얼마나 환불되는지 궁금하시죠?\n챗GPT 환불 확인하기\n\n\n \n 혹시 지난달 챗GPT가 갑자기 먹통이 되어 당황하셨던 분들 계신가요? 저도 정말 황당했어요. 중요한 작업 중이었는데, 갑자기 서비스가 끊기니 '이게 무슨 일이지?' 싶었죠. 그런데 얼마 전 오픈AI에서 장애에 대한 보상을 해준다는 메일을 받았지 뭐예요! 저처럼 챗GPT를 유료로 사용하고 계셨다면 이 소식이 정말 반가우실 텐데요, 어떤 기준으로 보상이 이루어지고 있는지 자세히 알아볼게요! \n \n챗GPT, 지난달 무슨 일이 있었나? \n지난 2025년 6월, 챗GPT를 포함한 오픈AI 서비스들이 두 차례에 걸쳐 크고 작은 장애를 겪었어요. 첫 번째는 정말 대규모였는데요, 6월 10일 오후 3시 36분부터 11일 오전 7시까지 무려 15시간 동안이나 서비스 오류가 발생했답니다. 로그인도 안 되고, 챗 응답은 지연되거나 아예 끊기고, 메시지 전송도 실패하는 등 다양한 문제가 있었어요.\n이 오류는 전 세계적으로 챗GPT, API, 그리고 영상 생성 AI인 소라(Sora) 등 오픈AI의 주요 서비스에 영향을 미쳤다고 해요. 오픈AI는 시스템 업데이트 도중 상당수의 서버 연결이 일시적으로 끊기면서 가용 처리 용량이 급격히 줄어든 것이 원인이라고 공식 발표했죠. 다행히 6월 11일 오전 7시경에는 완전 복구되었지만, 이어서 6월 26일 오전 10시경에는 유럽 등지에서 약 1시간 동안 접속 불가 및 응답 지연 현상이 또 발생했어요. 2주 만에 다시 발생한 장애라 신뢰성 우려가 제기되기도 했답니다.\n  알아두세요!\n이번 챗GPT 서비스 장애는 시스템 업데이트 중 서버 연결 불안정으로 인한 것이며, 전 세계적으로 약 15시간 동안 주요 서비스에 영향을 미쳤습니다.\n \n오픈AI의 보상 정책, 얼마나 환불해줄까? \n오픈AI는 이번 6월 10~11일 대규모 장애에 대해 공식적으로 사과하고, 유료 구독자를 대상으로 보상을 진행하고 있어요. 보상 대상은 챗GPT 플러스, 프로, 팀, 엔터프라이즈 멤버십 이용자뿐만 아니라 API 유료 고객까지 포함된다고 합니다. 중요한 건 별도 신청 절차 없이 자동 적용된다는 점이에요.\n챗gpt 환불 메일\n\n\n \n구체적인 보상 방식을 공식 발표하진 않았지만, 현재 월 구독료의 약 6.4%를 환불해주고 있는 것으로 알려졌어요. 예를 들어, 월 구독료가 22달러(부가세 포함 약 3만원)인 챗GPT 플러스 멤버십 이용자는 1.41달러(약 2000원)를 환불받았다는 제보가 잇따르고 있죠. 저도 1.41달러 환급 메일을 받았답니다. 이는 월 구독료를 장애 발생 시간에 비례하여 나눈 것으로 보여요. 아쉽게도 무료 요금제 이용자는 이번 보상 대상에서 제외된다고 하네요.\n오픈AI 챗GPT 장애 보상 요약\n항목\n내용\n\n\n\n\n주요 장애 발생일\n2025년 6월 10~11일, 6월 26일\n\n\n장애 원인\n시스템 업데이트 중 서버 처리량 급감\n\n\n영향 범위\n전 세계 챗GPT, API, 소라 등\n\n\n보상 대상\nPlus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, API 유료 고객\n\n\n보상 방식\n구독료 약 6.4% 환불 (자동 적용)\n\n\n무료 사용자\n보상 제외\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n유료 멤버십 이용자에게는 별도 신청 절차 없이 자동 환불이 진행되니, 결제 수단으로 환불 내역을 확인해보세요. 웹사이트 또는 앱스토어 결제자의 경우 필요시 각 경로로 개별 신청도 가능합니다.\n \n미래 AI 서비스의 안정성, 어떻게 지켜낼까?\n이번 챗GPT 장애를 겪으면서 대규모 AI 서비스의 안정성이 얼마나 중요한지 다시 한번 깨닫게 되었어요. 우리의 일상과 업무에 깊숙이 들어온 AI가 삐걱거리면 여간 불편한 게 아니더라고요. 오픈AI 같은 기업들이 앞으로 이런 문제를 어떻게 예방하고 대응할지 궁금해지네요.\n전문가들은 대규모 AI 서비스의 장애를 막기 위해 몇 가지 중요한 조치들이 필요하다고 강조합니다. 예를 들어, 실시간 모니터링 시스템을 고도화해서 장애 징후를 빠르게 감지하고, 문제가 생기면 자동으로 복구되도록 해야 한대요. 그리고 장애 발생 시 트래픽을 다른 서버로 돌리거나(우회), 임시 조치를 취하는 등 사전 정의된 대응 시나리오를 마련하는 것도 중요하겠죠.\n  알아두세요!\nAI 서비스의 안정성을 높이려면 시스템 이중화, 주기적 점검, 업데이트 시 점진적 배포 등 다각적인 노력이 필요하다고 전문가들은 말합니다.\n \n서비스 신뢰도를 높이는 기술적 접근 \n그럼 조금 더 기술적인 측면에서 어떤 조치들이 필요한지 알아볼까요? AI 서비스는 복잡한 시스템으로 이루어져 있기 때문에, 한 부분이 고장 나더라도 전체 서비스가 멈추지 않도록 설계하는 것이 정말 중요해요.\n기술적 안정성 확보 방안\n시스템 이중화 및 분산화: 서버, 네트워크, 데이터베이스 등 핵심 인프라를 여러 곳에 분산시키고 복제해서 한 곳이 고장 나도 다른 곳에서 대신 작동할 수 있도록 해야 합니다.\n클라우드 기반 자동 확장: 사용자가 몰리면 자동으로 서버 용량을 늘려주고, 트래픽을 여러 지역으로 분산시키는 기술을 적극 활용해야 해요.\n운영적 신뢰성 강화\n1) 정확한 원인 분석(RCA): 장애가 발생하면 왜 발생했는지, 무엇이 문제였는지 근본 원인을 파악하고 재발 방지 대책을 세워야 합니다.\n2) 주기적인 모의훈련: 실제 장애처럼 상황을 만들어서 직원들이 빠르고 정확하게 대응하는 훈련을 꾸준히 해야 합니다.\n→ 이런 노력들이 합쳐져야 서비스가 더욱 튼튼해지고, 사용자들도 안심하고 AI를 이용할 수 있겠죠!\n이번 챗GPT 장애 보상처럼 사후 대응도 중요하지만, 무엇보다 중요한 건 장애를 미연에 방지하고 발생하더라도 빠르게 복구할 수 있는 시스템을 갖추는 것이라고 생각해요. AI가 우리 삶의 필수적인 부분이 되어가는 만큼, 그 신뢰성은 무엇보다 우선시되어야 할 가치니까요.\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약 \n오늘은 챗GPT 서비스 장애와 오픈AI의 보상 소식, 그리고 앞으로 AI 서비스의 안정성을 높이기 위한 노력들에 대해 이야기해봤어요.\n \n \n챗GPT 장애 보상, 핵심 요약!\n✨ 주요 장애: 2025년 6월 10~11일, 챗GPT 및 OpenAI 서비스의 대규모 오류 발생.\n  보상 대상: 챗GPT 유료 멤버십 이용자 및 API 유료 고객.\n  보상 방식: 월 구독료의 약 6.4% 자동 환불 진행 (예: 22달러 구독 시 약 1.41달러).\n환불 금액 = 월 구독료 × (장애 시간 / 총 월 사용 시간)\n ‍  미래 대응: 실시간 모니터링, 시스템 이중화, 주기적 모의훈련 등으로 안정성 강화 예정.\n서비스 안정성은 AI 시대의 핵심 가치입니다.\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 챗GPT 장애 보상은 누가 받을 수 있나요?\nA: 챗GPT 플러스, 프로, 팀, 엔터프라이즈 등 유료 멤버십 이용자와 API 유료 고객이 보상 대상입니다. 무료 사용자에게는 보상이 제공되지 않습니다.\nQ: 보상을 받으려면 따로 신청해야 하나요?\nA: 아니요, 별도 신청 절차 없이 자동 적용될 예정입니다. 다만, 웹사이트나 앱스토어(Apple, Google Play) 결제 건은 필요시 각 경로로 개별 환불 신청이 가능합니다.\nQ: 보상 금액은 얼마나 되나요?\nA: 월 구독료의 약 6.4%가 환불되는 것으로 확인되었습니다. 이는 장애 발생 시간에 비례하여 계산된 것으로 보입니다.\nQ: 챗GPT 서비스는 지금 정상적으로 작동하나요?\nA: 네, 2025년 7월 2일 현재 챗GPT를 포함한 모든 오픈AI 서비스는 정상적으로 운영 중임을 오픈AI가 공식 안내했습니다.\nQ: 앞으로 이런 장애를 예방하기 위한 오픈AI의 노력은 무엇인가요?\nA: 오픈AI는 실시간 모니터링 시스템 고도화, 자동 복구 프로세스 마련, 시스템 이중화 및 분산화, 주기적인 점검 및 모의훈련 등을 통해 서비스 안정성을 강화할 예정입니다.\nAI 기술이 우리 삶의 깊숙이 들어온 만큼, 서비스의 안정성과 신뢰성은 그 무엇보다 중요한 가치가 되고 있어요. 이번 챗GPT 장애 보상처럼 사후 대응도 물론 중요하지만, 앞으로는 더 튼튼한 시스템으로 우리를 불편하게 하는 일이 없었으면 좋겠습니다.",

[palera1n](https://palera.in/), unc0ver 등이 대표적인 예입니다. 특히, 일부 웹사이트에서는 별도의 PC 없이도 iPhone에서 직접 탈옥할 수 있는 도구를 제공하며, 이를 이용해 많은 일반 사용자들도 손쉽게 탈옥을 시도할 수 있습니다. **탈옥한 iPhone에서는 트윅(Tweak)이나 모드 앱(Modified App)을 아무런 제약 없이 자유롭게 설치할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak01.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://palera.in/) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n### 게임 앱의 피해 사례\r\r\n![Jailbreak_02.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak02.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' </span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n이렇게 탈옥한 iOS 환경에서 최근 피해가 지속적으로 발생하는 분야는 바로 모바일 게임입니다. 과거에는 특정 사용자의 단독적인 해킹으로 피해가 크지 않았지만, 최근에는 조직적이고 상업적으로 특정 게임을 타깃으로 해커들이 게임 앱을 해킹하고 변조하여 이를 배포하는 사례가 많아지고 있습니다. 대표적으로 iOS 모드 앱 배포 사이트인 [iOSGods.com](iOSGods.com)과 같은 사이트들이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_03.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak03.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: iOSGods.com) </span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n하지만 공개된 사이트에서 배포되던 것과 달리 최근에는 텔레그램 등의 단체 대화방에서 은밀하게 거래가 이루어지기도 합니다. 때문에 개발사에서는 일일이 iOS 모드 앱 대응이 쉽지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 손쉽게 모드 앱을 설치하여 일부 유저가 게임 내에서 어뷰징을 하면 그 수가 적을지라도 게임사에게는 치명적인 피해를 입히게 됩니다. 게이머들이 게임을 하는 목적은 경쟁에서 승리하는 것인 경우가 많습니다. 하지만 어뷰징을 통해 노력 없이 한 번에 성과를 획득하는 일이 생기고 일부 유료 콘텐츠를 정당한 지불 없이 이용하기도 합니다. 이렇게 되면 유저들은 정당하게 엄청난 시간과 노력, 그리고 돈을 들여 게임을 할 가치를 못 느끼게 되고, 결국 게임 내 결제를 중단하거나 게임에서 이탈하게 되며, 이는 게임사의 매출 하락으로 이어집니다. 게임의 매출은 1~3%의 소수 유저들이 만들어 내기 때문입니다. 실제로 저희 NHN AppGuard의 한 조사에 따르면 대형 게임 해킹 사건 이후 매출이 하락했다는 결과가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_04.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak04.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n결과적으로 게임사의 매출과 앱 서비스에 대한 고객의 신뢰가 하락하게 되는 것입니다.\r\r\n자세한 내용은 [NHN Cloud On 웨비나 16｜사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z | 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법

4.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_05.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak05.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JailbreakMe) </span></center>\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n**JailbreakMe**는 Safari 웹 브라우저를 이용해 탈옥하는 방식으로, 사용자가 특정 웹사이트를 방문하는 것만으로도 탈옥이 가능했습니다. 이는 PDF 렌더링 엔진의 보안 취약점을 이용한 것으로, 사용자 입장에서 가장 간편한 탈옥 방법이었습니다. \r\r\n그러나 Apple이 보안 패치를 적용하면서 더 이상 사용이 불가능해졌습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Redsn0w & Greenpois0n (iOS 4.x ~ 5.x)\r\r\n이 시기의 탈옥은 USB를 통해 기기를 컴퓨터에 연결한 뒤, 전용 탈옥 프로그램을 실행하는 방식으로 이루어졌습니다. **Redsn0w**와 **Greenpois0n**은 각각 다른 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행하였으며, tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 해제됨) 및 untethered(영구 탈옥) 방식으로 나뉘었습니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n### Evasi0n (iOS

없는 특성을 가집니다. 다만, checkra1n은 semi-tethered 방식으로, 재부팅 후에는 다시 탈옥 프로세스를 수행해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n최근에는 Apple이 보안 강화를 지속하면서 탈옥이 점점 어려워지고 있으며, 대부분의 탈옥이 semi-tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 풀림) 형태로 제공되고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 4. 탈옥한 iOS 장치의 보안 취약점\r\r\n탈옥한 iOS 장치는 Apple이 제공하는 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하기 때문에 여러 가지 보안 취약점에 노출됩니다. 다음은 탈옥한 iOS가 갖는 주요 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **시스템 보안 우회**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple의 기본 보안 메커니즘을 우회하여 시스템 파일을 수정할 수 있습니다. 이는 악성 코드나 바이러스가 시스템에 침투하기 쉽게 만듭니다.\r\r\n* **앱 간 데이터 접근**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 앱 간의 데이터 접근이 가능해져, 민감한 정보가 유출될 위험이 높아집니다.\r\r\n* **루트 권한 노출**: 탈옥한 기기는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있어, 시스템 파일을 자유롭게 변경할 수 있습니다. 이는 해커가 기기를 완전히 제어할 수 있는 가능성을 열어줍니다.\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹 위험**: 탈옥한 기기에서는 악성 소프트웨어나 해킹 툴이 쉽게 설치될 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 위험에 빠뜨릴 수 있습니다.\r\r\n* **보안 업데이트 차단**: 탈옥한 기기는 Apple로부터 자동 업데이트를 받지 못하게 되어 중요한 보안 패치와 기능 업데이트를 놓칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n특히, 탈옥한 장치에는 앱의 실행을 제한하는 보안 프로세스가 없기 때문에, 악성 소프트웨어가 시스템에 침투할 가능성이 높아집니다. 이러한 위험은 사용자의 개인 정보와 금융 정보를 보호하는 데 큰 위협이 될 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 온라인 뱅킹 앱이나 결제 서비스 앱에 저장된 정보가 해커의 손에 넘어갈 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 5. iOS 탈옥이 배포하는 앱에 미치는 영향\r\r\n### 5.1. 보안 취약점 증가\r\r\n* **악성 코드 및 해킹에 노출**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 운영체제의 보안 계층이 무너져 악성 코드나 해킹에 취약합니다. 이는 앱 내에서 수집되는 데이터나 사용자 정보가 유출될 위험을 증가시키며, 개발자의 신뢰도에도 부정적인 영향을 미칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **앱 무결성 손상**\r\r\n탈옥한 환경에서는 앱의 코드가 변조될 수 있어 앱의 무결성이 손상될 수 있습니다. 이는 앱의 정상적인 동작을 방해하고, 예기치 않은 오류나 버그를 유발할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.2. 불법 복제 및 수익 손실\r\r\n* **앱 불법 복제 증가**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 앱의 불법 복제나 유료 앱을 무료로 설치할 수 있는 환경을 제공합니다. 이러한 행위를 도와주는 모드 앱 또한 증가합니다. 이는 개발자의 직접적인 수익 손실로 이어지며, 앱 비즈니스 모델에 큰 타격을 줄 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **인앱 결제 우회**\r\r\n탈옥을 통한 인앱 결제 우회는 트윅을 설치하거나 앱 변조를 통해 유료 기능을 무료로 사용하는 사례도 많습니다. 이는 개발자의 추가 수익 창출 기회를 감소시키고, 공정한 수익 구조를 해칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.3. 사용자 경험 저하\r\r\n* **앱의 안정성 문제**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서는 시스템 안정성이 떨어져 앱의 크래시(crash)나 프리즈(freeze) 현상이 빈번하게 발생할 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자에게 부정적인 경험을 주며, 앱에 대한 만족도를 크게 저하시킬 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **지원 불가능한 환경**\r\r\n탈옥 환경은 표준 iOS 환경이 아니기 때문에 개발자가 예상하지 못한 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 추가적인 자원을 투입하기 어려워, 사용자 지원에 한계를 겪을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 6. iOS 탈옥 탐지 방법\r\r\n앱 개발자는 탈옥한 장치에서 앱을 보호하기 위해 기기의 상태를 탐지해야 합니다. 탈옥한 장치를 탐지하는 데 사용되는 다양한 기법들이 있으며, 각 기법은 고유한 특징과 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 주요 탐지 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.1. 시스템 파일 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 시스템 파일에 변화를 일으키는 경우가 많습니다. 대표적인 예로 `/private/var/lib/cydia`나 `/bin/bash` 같은 파일들이 존재하는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 이러한 파일들은 일반적으로 탈옥 도구를 설치할 때 생성됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc isJailbroken() -> Bool {\r\r\n    // 확인할 시스템 파일 경로들\r\r\n    let jailbreakPaths = [\r\r\n        \"/private/var/lib/cydia\",  // Cydia 파일\r\r\n        \"/bin/bash\",               // bash 파일\r\r\n        \"/usr/sbin/sshd\",          // SSH 서버 파일\r\r\n        \"/etc/apt\"                 // APT 디렉터리\r\r\n    ]\r\r\n    \r\r\n    // 각 파일/디렉터리 존재 여부 체크\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakPaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            return true  // 파일이 존재하면 탈옥된 기기\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    \r\r\n    return false  // 파일이 없으면 탈옥되지 않은 기기\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.2. API 호출 감지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 주로 사용되는 특정 API 호출을 감지하여 탈옥 여부를 판단할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, `fork()`, `sysctl()` 등의 함수 호출은 탈옥과 관련된 행동을 나타낼 수 있습니다. 이러한 함수 호출을 모니터링하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc checkFork() -> Bool {\r\r\n    let pid = fork()\r\r\n    if pid == 0 {\r\r\n        // 자식 프로세스 종료 (fork가 성공하면 탈옥 가능성이 높음)\r\r\n        exit(0)\r\r\n    } else if pid > 0 {\r\r\n        print(\"fork() 호출 가능 - 탈옥된 기기일 수 있음\")\r\r\n        return true\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.3. 탈옥 도구 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 MobileSubstrate, Frida, Cydia 등과 같은 탈옥 도구들이 설치됩니다. 이러한 도구들이 설치되어 있는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Cydia 앱이 설치되어 있는지 확인하는 방법이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n// 확인할 파일 및 디렉터리 목록\r\r\nlet jailbreakFilePaths: [String] = [\r\r\n    \"/Applications/Cydia.app\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/lib/cydia/\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/tmp/cydia.log\"\r\r\n]\r\r\n\r\r\n// 파일 존재 여부 확인 함수\r\r\nfunc checkJailbreakFiles() -> Bool {\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakFilePaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            print(\"탈옥 관련 파일 발견: \\(path)\")\r\r\n            return true\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.4. 비공식 앱 설치 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 Apple의 공식 앱 스토어 외에도 비공식 앱 스토어를 통해 앱을 설치할 수 있습니다. 따라서 비공식적으로 설치된 앱들을 탐지하여 탈옥 여부를 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.5. 루트 접근 권한 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있기 때문에, 루트 권한으로 실행된 프로세스나 파일들을 확인하는 방법이 있습니다. 시스템 내에서 루트 권한을 사용하는 프로세스나 파일 접근 시 이를 탐지할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위험을 완전히 없애는 것은 불가능할 수 있지만, 여러 방어 기법을 결합하여 다층적인 보안을 구축하는 것이 중요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 7. 나가며\r\r\niOS 앱 개발자는 사용자 데이터를 보호하고, 앱의 안전한 환경을 제공하는 중요한 책임을 지고 있습니다. 탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위협을 사전에 탐지하고 방어하는 것은 필수적인 작업입니다. 탈옥 탐지 및 방어 기능을 통해 앱의 보안을 강화하고, 사용자가 안전하게 앱을 사용할 수 있도록 보장해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n글로벌 IT기업 NHN이 직접 만든 **NHN AppGuard**는 탈옥 기기에서 발생하는 다양한 보안 위협에 대응할 수 있는 필수적인 보안 솔루션입니다. NHN AppGuard를 적용하여 배포하면 아래와 같이 탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단할 수 있도록 정책을 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_08.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak08.png)\r\r\n <center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단하기 위한 NHN AppGuard 정책 설정 화면</span></center>\r\r\n <br>\r\r\n 배포된 앱이 실행되는 중 탈옥이 탐지되면 곧바로 탐지에 대한 로그를 남기며 이를 추적할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n \r\r\n![Jailbreak_09.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak09.png)\r\r\n<center><span style=\"font-size:80%\">탈옥 탐지 로그 조회 화면</span></center>\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n이렇게 NHN AppGuard는 앱 운영자가 기기 보안에 대한 걱정 없이 안정적인 서비스 제공에 집중할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 강력한 탈옥 탐지와 차단 기능을 통해 앱의 무결성과 사용자 데이터를 완벽하게 보호할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n>  [NHN AppGuard 더 알아보기](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/service/security/nhn-appguard)\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 iOS 탈옥의 개념과 역사, 탈옥한 장치에서의 피해 사례, 최신 탈옥 방법, 보안 위협, 그리고 개발자가 탈옥을 탐지하고 방어하는 방법에 대해 알아보았습니다. iOS 앱 개발자 분들뿐만 아니라 iOS를 사용하거나 보안에 관심이 있는 모든 분들께 도움이 되었길 바랍니다. 긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_202507-01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooter20250701.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

[palera1n](https://palera.in/), unc0ver 등이 대표적인 예입니다. 특히, 일부 웹사이트에서는 별도의 PC 없이도 iPhone에서 직접 탈옥할 수 있는 도구를 제공하며, 이를 이용해 많은 일반 사용자들도 손쉽게 탈옥을 시도할 수 있습니다. **탈옥한 iPhone에서는 트윅(Tweak)이나 모드 앱(Modified App)을 아무런 제약 없이 자유롭게 설치할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak01.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://palera.in/) \r\r\n\r\r\n### 게임 앱의 피해 사례\r\r\n![Jailbreak_02.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak02.png)\r\r\nNHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!' \r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 탈옥한 iOS 환경에서 최근 피해가 지속적으로 발생하는 분야는 바로 모바일 게임입니다. 과거에는 특정 사용자의 단독적인 해킹으로 피해가 크지 않았지만, 최근에는 조직적이고 상업적으로 특정 게임을 타깃으로 해커들이 게임 앱을 해킹하고 변조하여 이를 배포하는 사례가 많아지고 있습니다. 대표적으로 iOS 모드 앱 배포 사이트인 [iOSGods.com](iOSGods.com)과 같은 사이트들이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_03.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak03.png)\r\r\n(Source: iOSGods.com) \r\r\n\r\r\n하지만 공개된 사이트에서 배포되던 것과 달리 최근에는 텔레그램 등의 단체 대화방에서 은밀하게 거래가 이루어지기도 합니다. 때문에 개발사에서는 일일이 iOS 모드 앱 대응이 쉽지 않습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 손쉽게 모드 앱을 설치하여 일부 유저가 게임 내에서 어뷰징을 하면 그 수가 적을지라도 게임사에게는 치명적인 피해를 입히게 됩니다. 게이머들이 게임을 하는 목적은 경쟁에서 승리하는 것인 경우가 많습니다. 하지만 어뷰징을 통해 노력 없이 한 번에 성과를 획득하는 일이 생기고 일부 유료 콘텐츠를 정당한 지불 없이 이용하기도 합니다. 이렇게 되면 유저들은 정당하게 엄청난 시간과 노력, 그리고 돈을 들여 게임을 할 가치를 못 느끼게 되고, 결국 게임 내 결제를 중단하거나 게임에서 이탈하게 되며, 이는 게임사의 매출 하락으로 이어집니다. 게임의 매출은 1~3%의 소수 유저들이 만들어 내기 때문입니다. 실제로 저희 NHN AppGuard의 한 조사에 따르면 대형 게임 해킹 사건 이후 매출이 하락했다는 결과가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_04.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak04.png)\r\r\nNHN Cloud On 웨비나 16, '사례로 알아보는 NHN AppGuard 실전 A to Z: 모바일 앱 해킹 유형별 대응 방법 공개!'

4.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_05.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak05.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JailbreakMe) \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n**JailbreakMe**는 Safari 웹 브라우저를 이용해 탈옥하는 방식으로, 사용자가 특정 웹사이트를 방문하는 것만으로도 탈옥이 가능했습니다. 이는 PDF 렌더링 엔진의 보안 취약점을 이용한 것으로, 사용자 입장에서 가장 간편한 탈옥 방법이었습니다. \r\r\n그러나 Apple이 보안 패치를 적용하면서 더 이상 사용이 불가능해졌습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Redsn0w & Greenpois0n (iOS 4.x ~ 5.x)\r\r\n이 시기의 탈옥은 USB를 통해 기기를 컴퓨터에 연결한 뒤, 전용 탈옥 프로그램을 실행하는 방식으로 이루어졌습니다. **Redsn0w**와 **Greenpois0n**은 각각 다른 커널 취약점을 이용하여 탈옥을 수행하였으며, tethered(재부팅 시 탈옥이 해제됨) 및 untethered(영구 탈옥) 방식으로 나뉘었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Evasi0n (iOS 6.x)\r\r\n![Jailbreak_06.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak06.png)\r\r\n(Source: https://evasi0n.com/)

변조될 수 있어 앱의 무결성이 손상될 수 있습니다. 이는 앱의 정상적인 동작을 방해하고, 예기치 않은 오류나 버그를 유발할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.2. 불법 복제 및 수익 손실\r\r\n* **앱 불법 복제 증가**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 앱의 불법 복제나 유료 앱을 무료로 설치할 수 있는 환경을 제공합니다. 이러한 행위를 도와주는 모드 앱 또한 증가합니다. 이는 개발자의 직접적인 수익 손실로 이어지며, 앱 비즈니스 모델에 큰 타격을 줄 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **인앱 결제 우회**\r\r\n탈옥을 통한 인앱 결제 우회는 트윅을 설치하거나 앱 변조를 통해 유료 기능을 무료로 사용하는 사례도 많습니다. 이는 개발자의 추가 수익 창출 기회를 감소시키고, 공정한 수익 구조를 해칠 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 5.3. 사용자 경험 저하\r\r\n* **앱의 안정성 문제**\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서는 시스템 안정성이 떨어져 앱의 크래시(crash)나 프리즈(freeze) 현상이 빈번하게 발생할 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자에게 부정적인 경험을 주며, 앱에 대한 만족도를 크게 저하시킬 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* **지원 불가능한 환경**\r\r\n탈옥 환경은 표준 iOS 환경이 아니기 때문에 개발자가 예상하지 못한 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 추가적인 자원을 투입하기 어려워, 사용자 지원에 한계를 겪을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 6. iOS 탈옥 탐지 방법\r\r\n앱 개발자는 탈옥한 장치에서 앱을 보호하기 위해 기기의 상태를 탐지해야 합니다. 탈옥한 장치를 탐지하는 데 사용되는 다양한 기법들이 있으며, 각 기법은 고유한 특징과 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 주요 탐지 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.1. 시스템 파일 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 시스템 파일에 변화를 일으키는 경우가 많습니다. 대표적인 예로 `/private/var/lib/cydia`나 `/bin/bash` 같은 파일들이 존재하는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 이러한 파일들은 일반적으로 탈옥 도구를 설치할 때 생성됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc isJailbroken() -> Bool {\r\r\n    // 확인할 시스템 파일 경로들\r\r\n    let jailbreakPaths = [\r\r\n        \"/private/var/lib/cydia\",  // Cydia 파일\r\r\n        \"/bin/bash\",               // bash 파일\r\r\n        \"/usr/sbin/sshd\",          // SSH 서버 파일\r\r\n        \"/etc/apt\"                 // APT 디렉터리\r\r\n    ]\r\r\n    \r\r\n    // 각 파일/디렉터리 존재 여부 체크\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakPaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            return true  // 파일이 존재하면 탈옥된 기기\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    \r\r\n    return false  // 파일이 없으면 탈옥되지 않은 기기\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.2. API 호출 감지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 주로 사용되는 특정 API 호출을 감지하여 탈옥 여부를 판단할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, `fork()`, `sysctl()` 등의 함수 호출은 탈옥과 관련된 행동을 나타낼 수 있습니다. 이러한 함수 호출을 모니터링하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\nfunc checkFork() -> Bool {\r\r\n    let pid = fork()\r\r\n    if pid == 0 {\r\r\n        // 자식 프로세스 종료 (fork가 성공하면 탈옥 가능성이 높음)\r\r\n        exit(0)\r\r\n    } else if pid > 0 {\r\r\n        print(\"fork() 호출 가능 - 탈옥된 기기일 수 있음\")\r\r\n        return true\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.3. 탈옥 도구 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 MobileSubstrate, Frida, Cydia 등과 같은 탈옥 도구들이 설치됩니다. 이러한 도구들이 설치되어 있는지 확인하여 탈옥 여부를 탐지할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Cydia 앱이 설치되어 있는지 확인하는 방법이 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n// 확인할 파일 및 디렉터리 목록\r\r\nlet jailbreakFilePaths: [String] = [\r\r\n    \"/Applications/Cydia.app\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/lib/cydia/\",\r\r\n    \"/private/var/tmp/cydia.log\"\r\r\n]\r\r\n\r\r\n// 파일 존재 여부 확인 함수\r\r\nfunc checkJailbreakFiles() -> Bool {\r\r\n    for path in jailbreakFilePaths {\r\r\n        if FileManager.default.fileExists(atPath: path) {\r\r\n            print(\"탈옥 관련 파일 발견: \\(path)\")\r\r\n            return true\r\r\n        }\r\r\n    }\r\r\n    return false\r\r\n}\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.4. 비공식 앱 설치 탐지\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에는 Apple의 공식 앱 스토어 외에도 비공식 앱 스토어를 통해 앱을 설치할 수 있습니다. 따라서 비공식적으로 설치된 앱들을 탐지하여 탈옥 여부를 확인할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 6.5. 루트 접근 권한 검사\r\r\n탈옥한 장치는 루트 권한을 얻을 수 있기 때문에, 루트 권한으로 실행된 프로세스나 파일들을 확인하는 방법이 있습니다. 시스템 내에서 루트 권한을 사용하는 프로세스나 파일 접근 시 이를 탐지할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위험을 완전히 없애는 것은 불가능할 수 있지만, 여러 방어 기법을 결합하여 다층적인 보안을 구축하는 것이 중요합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 7. 나가며\r\r\niOS 앱 개발자는 사용자 데이터를 보호하고, 앱의 안전한 환경을 제공하는 중요한 책임을 지고 있습니다. 탈옥한 장치에서 발생할 수 있는 보안 위협을 사전에 탐지하고 방어하는 것은 필수적인 작업입니다. 탈옥 탐지 및 방어 기능을 통해 앱의 보안을 강화하고, 사용자가 안전하게 앱을 사용할 수 있도록 보장해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n글로벌 IT기업 NHN이 직접 만든 **NHN AppGuard**는 탈옥 기기에서 발생하는 다양한 보안 위협에 대응할 수 있는 필수적인 보안 솔루션입니다. NHN AppGuard를 적용하여 배포하면 아래와 같이 탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단할 수 있도록 정책을 설정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Jailbreak_08.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak08.png)\r\r\n 탈옥 환경을 탐지하고 차단하기 위한 NHN AppGuard 정책 설정 화면\r\r\n \n\r\r\n 배포된 앱이 실행되는 중 탈옥이 탐지되면 곧바로 탐지에 대한 로그를 남기며 이를 추적할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n \r\r\n![Jailbreak_09.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Jailbreak09.png)\r\r\n탈옥 탐지 로그 조회 화면\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 NHN AppGuard는 앱 운영자가 기기 보안에 대한 걱정 없이 안정적인 서비스 제공에 집중할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 강력한 탈옥 탐지와 차단 기능을 통해 앱의 무결성과 사용자 데이터를 완벽하게 보호할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n>  [NHN AppGuard 더 알아보기](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/service/security/nhn-appguard)\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 iOS 탈옥의 개념과 역사, 탈옥한 장치에서의 피해 사례, 최신 탈옥 방법, 보안 위협, 그리고 개발자가 탈옥을 탐지하고 방어하는 방법에 대해 알아보았습니다. iOS 앱 개발자 분들뿐만 아니라 iOS를 사용하거나 보안에 관심이 있는 모든 분들께 도움이 되었길 바랍니다. 긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_202507-01.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooter20250701.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

DSR 3단계 시행 전 연봉 기준으로 대출 한도가 약 3억 원 정도였고, 이는 LTV 70%로 계산한 4.2억보다 더 낮았어요.\n결국 김토스는 규제 전에도 LTV가 아닌 DSR 한도에 따라 최대 3억 원까지만 대출을 받을 수 있었고, 여기에 7월부터 DSR 3단계가 적용되면서 한도가 더 줄어 최대 2.4억까지만 대출이 되는 상황인 거죠. 지금까지 한 설명을 표로 요약하면 아래와 같아요. \n\n2️⃣ 고소득자, 박토스\n\n\n연봉: 1억 원\n목표 주택: 규제 지역(강남, 서초, 반포 등) 12억 원 아파트 \n주택 보유 여부: X \n\n\n고소득 생애 최초 주택 구매자라면 어떨까요? 박토스는 연봉 1억 원을 받는 고소득 직장인으로, 강남·서초·반포 등 규제 지역에 있는 12억 원대 아파트를 구매하려고 합니다. 6.27 부동산 대책 전에는 집 값의 최대 80%까지 대출 가능했지만, 규제 후에는 70%만 가능해졌고, 이마저도 대출 한도가 6억 원으로 제한되었어요.\n결과적으로 규제 전에는 약 2.4억 원만 자기 자금으로 준비하면 됐지만, 규제 이후에는 최소 6억 원 이상이 필요해진 거죠. 그런데 여기에 DSR 3단계 규제까지 더해지면서, 실제로 받을 수 있는 대출 금액은 6억 원보다 더 낮아졌고, 그만큼 자기부담금도 더 늘어나게 되었어요.\n종합하면 박토스는 LTV와 DSR 두 가지 규제 모두 강화된 상황에서 대출 한도가 크게 줄어 내 집 마련 계획에 차질이 생기게 되었어요.\n\n3️⃣ 지방 거주자, 이토스\n\n\n연봉: 1억 원 \n목표 주택: 수도권 외 지역 12억 원 아파트  \n주택 보유 여부: X \n\n\n만약 박토스와 동일한 조건인데 주택을 구매하려는 지역이 비규제 지역이라면, 대출 한도는 어떻게 될까요? 이토스는 수도권 외 지역에 거주하는 연소득 1억 원의 직장인으로, 생애 첫 주택 구매를 위해 12억 원 아파트를 알아보고 있어요. 비규제 지역이자 생애 최초 주택 구매자이기 때문에, 6.27 부동산 대책 이후에도 여전히 LTV는 최대 80%까지 적용 받을 수 있습니다. 이 경우 이론상 9.6억까지 대출이 가능하고, 자기부담금은 2.4억이면 구매할 수 있는 거죠.\n그런데 대출을 언제 받느냐에 따라 상황은 완전히 달라집니다. \n지방 주택담보대출은 2025년 말까지 규제 3단계가 유예되어, 기존 수준인 0.75%p만 추가하는 완화 조치가 적용됩니다. 만약 이토스가 2025년 하반기에 대출을 받는다면, 연봉 1억 원 기준으로 약 5억 원까지 대출이 가능할 것으로 보입니다. 이 경우 자기부담금으로는 7억 원 정도가 되죠. \n하지만 2026년부터는 스트레스 금리가 +1.5%p로 올라가게 됩니다. 이 때문에 같은 조건이라도 대출 가능액은 4.0~4.2억 원 수준으로 줄고, 자기부담금은 최대 8억 원까지 늘어나는 셈이에요. 결론적으로는 지방 거주자의 경우 대출 타이밍이 핵심이라는 뜻이에요. 위 내용을 표로 다시 정리하면 이렇습니다. \n\n그래서 나는 \n정확히 얼마까지 빌릴 수 있을까?\n여기까지의 사례와 정리된 대책 내용을 읽고 나면, 결국 가장 궁금한 건 ‘나는 얼마까지 빌릴 수 있지?’일 거예요. 더 구체적으로는 ‘LTV 70% vs DSR 40% vs 6억 상한선 중 어떤 기준이 나의 대출 한도를 많이 줄일지, DSR 3단계가 적용되면 대출이 얼마나 더 줄어들지, 정책대출 받으면 조건이 달라질지’ 등 나의 상황에 맞는 최적의 대출 현황이 궁금해지죠. \n하지만 매번 바뀌는 규제에 맞춰 일일이 계산하기엔 너무 복잡해요. 토스에서는 복잡한 규제 변화를 모두 반영해서, 내 상황에서 실제로 받을 수 있는 정확한 한도를 보여주는데요. 77개 금융사 조건을 한눈에 비교할 수 있고, 6.27 부동산 대책이나 DSR 3단계처럼 복잡한 규제를 직접 계산할 필요 없이, 토스에서 내 상황에 맞는 정확한 답을 찾을 수 있어요.\n이런 내용을 미리 알아둔다면, 좋은 기회가 왔을 때 빠르게 움직일 수 있어요. 복잡한 규제 속에서도 내 집 마련의 꿈, 새로운 전략으로 다시 시작해보세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 유서진 Graphic 조수희 이제현",

ATM이나 앱에서 바로 돈을 인출할 수 있지만, 다음 결제일에 한꺼번에 갚아야 하고 이자도 바로 붙어요. 급하게 돈이 필요하다면 쓸 수 있지만, 반복해서 서비스를 이용한다면 신용점수에 좋지 않은 영향을 줄 수 있어요.\n장기카드대출(카드론): 현금서비스보다 기간이 길고, 갚는 방식도 여러 달에 걸쳐 나눠 갚는 대출 서비스예요. 카드값처럼 매달 원금과 이자를 나눠 내는 구조죠. 신청은 간편하지만 이자율은 꽤 높은 편이라 정말 필요한 상황에만 쓰는 것을 권해요.\n이월 잔액: 지난달에 다 갚지 못해 이번 달로 넘어온 카드값이에요. 명세서에서 자주 보이지만, 그냥 지나치기 쉬워요. 이자가 붙는 기준이 되기 때문에 꼼꼼히 확인해야 해요.\n선결제: 카드값을 결제일 전에 미리 갚는 기능이에요. 리볼빙이나 카드론처럼 이자가 붙는 서비스를 이용 중이라면, 선결제로 부담을 줄일 수 있어요.\n연체 이자율: 카드값을 제때 못 냈을 때 붙는 높은 이자율이에요. 일반 이자보다 더 비싸고, 연체 기간이 길어질수록 부담도 커져요. 자동이체나 결제 알림 설정으로 미리 방지하는 게 좋아요.\nCVV: 카드 뒷면에 있는 3자리 보안코드예요. 온라인 결제 시 인증용으로 쓰이는데, 이 번호만 알아도 결제가 가능하다는 점에서 유출 위험이 크기 때문에 보안에 신경 써야 해요.\n지금 알아두면\n나중에 도움 될 거예요\n지금 당장 쓸 일은 없어도, 알고 있으면 나중에 큰 도움이 될 수 있는 권리들을 알려드릴게요.\n할부 항변권: 할부로 산 물건에 문제가 있거나 가맹점에 문제가 생겼을 때, 잔여 할부금의 납입을 거부할 수 있는 소비자 권리예요. 20만 원 이상, 3개월 이상 할부일 때만 행사할 수 있으니 기억해두세요.\n할부 철회권: 상품 또는 서비스를 제공받은 날로부터 7일 이내라면, 단순 변심으로도 할부 계약을 철회할 수 있어요. 단, 상품을 이미 사용했거나 훼손시킨 경우에는 적용되지 않아요. 할부 항변권과 마찬가지로 20만 원 이상, 3개월 이상 할부 조건일 때 가능한 권리예요.\n부가서비스 해지: 카드 발급 시 나도 모르게 자동으로 가입된 유료 서비스가 있을 수 있어요. 내가 원하지 않았던 유료 서비스를 발견했다면 고객센터나 앱에서 해지할 수 있어요. 명세서를 꼼꼼하게 확인하지 않는다면 모르고 지나칠 수 있으니, 제대로 체크하는 습관이 필요해요.\n토스에서\n내게 맞는 신용카드 찾기\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n신용카드는 누구나 쉽게 만들고 쓸 수 있지만, 카드를 사용하며 만나게 되는 단어들은 결코 쉽지 않아요. 의미를 잘 모른 채 카드를 고르면, 혜택을 못 받거나 필요 없는 서비스에 가입하게 될 우려가 있어요.\n이 글을 통해 용어들을 꼼꼼하게 읽었다면, 이제 어떤 카드가 나에게 필요한지 찾고 비교하는 일만 남았을 거예요. 그런데 카드 정보를 찾아 여기저기 돌아다니는 일도 참 힘든 일입니다.\n.css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스 카드라운지에서는 연회비, 실적 조건, 혜택 방식까지 내가 관심 있는 여러 카드를 비교함에 담아 한눈에 볼 수 있어요. 카드 선택부터 발급까지 한 번에 쉽게 끝낼 수 있으니, 지금 바로 토스 카드라운지에서 나에게 딱 맞는 카드를 찾아보세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희 이제현\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✽준법감시인 심의완료(2025-361호)",
