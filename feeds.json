        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details of the role backend aggregation (BAG) plays in building Meta’s gigawatt-scale AI clusters like Prometheus.\nBAG allows us to seamlessly connect thousands of GPUs across multiple data centers and regions.\nOur BAG implementation is connecting two different network fabrics – Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF).\nOnce it’s complete our AI cluster, Prometheus, will deliver 1-gigawatt of capacity to enhance and enable new and existing AI experiences across Meta products. Prometheus’ infrastructure will span several data center buildings in a single larger region, interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs.\nA key piece of scaling and connecting this infrastructure is backend aggregation (BAG), which we use to seamlessly connect GPUs and data centers with robust, high-capacity networking. By leveraging modular hardware, advanced routing, and resilient topologies, BAG ensures both performance and reliability at unprecedented scale\nAs our AI clusters continue to grow, we expect BAG to play an important role in meeting future demands and driving innovation across Meta’s global network.\nWhat Is Backend Aggregation?\nBAG is a centralized Ethernet-based super spine network layer that primarily functions to interconnect multiple spine layer fabrics across various data centers and regions within large clusters. Within Prometheus, for example, the BAG layer serves as the aggregation point between regional networks and Meta’s backbone, enabling the creation of mega AI clusters. BAG is designed to support immense bandwidth needs, with inter-BAG capacities reaching the petabit range (e.g., 16-48 Pbps per region pair).\nWe use backend aggregation (BAG) to interconnect data center regions to share compute and other resources into large clusters.\nHow BAG Is Helping Us Build Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters \nTo address the challenge of interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs, we’re deploying distributed BAG layers regionally.\nHow We Interconnect BAG Layers\nBAG layers are strategically distributed across regions to serve subsets of L2 fabrics, adhering to distance, buffer, and latency constraints. Inter-BAG connectivity utilizes either a planar (direct match) or spread connection topology, chosen based on site size and fiber availability.\nPlanar topology connects BAG switches one-to-one between regions following the plane, offering simplified management but concentrating potential failure domains.\nSpread connection topology distributes links across multiple BAG switches/planes, enhancing path diversity and resilience.\nAn example of an inter-BAG network topology.\nHow a BAG Layer Connects to L2 Fabrics\nSo far, we’ve discussed how the BAG layers are interconnected, now let’s see how a BAG layer connects downstream to L2 fabrics.\nWe’ve used two main fabric technologies, Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) to build L2 networks.\nBelow is an example of DSF L2 zones across five data center buildings connected to the BAG layer via a special backend edge pod in each building. \nA BAG inter-building connection for DSF fabric across five data centers.\nBelow is an example of NSF L2 connected to BAG planes. Each BAG plane connects to matching Spine Training Switches (STSWs) from all spine planes. Effective oversubscription is 4.98:1.  \n\nA BAG inter-building connection for NSF fabric.\nCareful management of oversubscription ratios assists in balancing scale and performance. Typical oversubscription from L2 to BAG is around 4.5:1, while BAG-to-BAG oversubscription varies based on regional requirements and link capacity.\nHardware and Routing \nMeta’s implementation of BAG uses a modular chassis equipped with Jericho3 (J3) ASIC line cards, each providing up to 432x800G ports for high-capacity, scalable, and resilient interconnect. The central hub BAG employs a larger chassis to accommodate numerous spokes and long-distance links with varied cable lengths for optimized buffer utilization.\nRouting within BAG uses eBGP with link bandwidth attributes, enabling Unequal Cost Multipath (UCMP) for efficient load balancing and robust failure handling. BAG-to-BAG connections are secured with MACsec, aligning with network security requirements.\nDesigning the Network for Resilience\nThe network design meticulously details port striping, IP addressing schemes, and comprehensive failure domain analysis to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of failures. Failure modes are analyzed at the BAG, data hall, and power distribution levels. We also employ various strategies to mitigate blackholing risks, including draining affected BAG planes and conditional route aggregation.\nConsiderations for Long Cable Distances\nAn important advantage of BAG’s distributed architecture is it keeps the distance from the L2 edge small, which is important for shallow buffer NSF switches. Longer, BAG-to-BAG, cable distances dictate that we use deep buffer switches for the BAG role. This provides a large headroom buffer to support lossless congestion control protocols like PFC.  \nBuilding Prometheus and Beyond\nAs a technology, BAG is playing an important role in Meta’s next generation of AI infrastructure. By centralizing the interconnection of regional networks, BAG helps enable the gigawatt-scale Prometheus cluster, ensuring seamless, high-capacity networking across tens of thousands of GPUs. This thoughtful design, leveraging modular hardware and resilient topologies, positions BAG to not only meet the demands of Prometheus but also to drive the future innovation and scalability of Meta’s global AI network for years to come.\nThe post Building Prometheus: How Backend Aggregation Enables Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "pubDate": "Wed, 04 Feb 2026 22:00:07 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing a novel approach to enabling cross-device passkey authentication for devices with inaccessible displays (like XR devices).\nOur approach bypasses the use of QR codes and enables cross-device authentication without the need for an on-device display, while still complying with all trust and proximity requirements.\nThis approach builds on work done by the FIDO Alliance and we hope it will open the door to bring secure, passwordless authentication to a whole new ecosystem of devices and platforms.\nPasskeys are a significant leap forward in authentication, offering a phishing-resistant, cryptographically secure alternative to traditional passwords. Generally, the standard cross-device passkey flow, where someone registers or authenticates on a desktop device by approving the action on their nearby mobile device, is done in a familiar way with QR codes scanned by their phone camera.  But how can we facilitate this flow for XR devices with a head-mounted display or no screen at all, or for other devices with an inaccessible display like smart home hubs and industrial sensors? \nWe’ve taken a  novel approach to adapting the WebAuthn passkey flow and FIDO’s CTAP hybrid protocol for this unique class of devices that either lack a screen entirely or whose screen is not easily accessible to another device’s camera. Our implementation has been developed and is now broadly available on Meta Quest devices powered by Meta Horizon OS. We hope that this approach can also ensure robust security built on the strength of existing passkey frameworks, without sacrificing usability, for users of a variety of other screenless IoT devices, consumer electronics, and industrial hardware.\n\nThe Challenge: No Screen, No QR Code\nThe standard cross-device flow relies on two primary mechanisms:\nQR code scanning: The relying party displays a QR code on the desktop/inaccessible device, which the mobile authenticator scans to establish a secure link.\nBluetooth/NFC proximity: The devices use local communication protocols to discover each other and initiate the secure exchange.\nFor devices with no display, the QR code method is impossible. Proximity-based discovery is feasible, but initiating the user verification step and confirming the intent without any on-device visual feedback can introduce security and usability risks. People need clear assurance that they are approving the correct transaction on the correct device.\nOur Solution: Using a Companion App for Secure Message Transport\nScanning a QR code sends the authenticator device a command to initiate a hybrid (cross-device) login flow with a nonce that identifies the unauthenticated device client. But if a user has a companion application – like the Meta Horizon app – that uses the same account as the device we can use that application to pass this same request to the authenticator OS and execute it using general link/intent execution.\nWe made the flow easy to navigate by using in-app notifications to show users when a login request has been initiated, take them directly into the application, and immediately execute the login request.\nFor simplicity, we opted to begin the hybrid flow as soon as the application is opened since the user would have had to take some action (clicking the notification or opening the app) to trigger this and there is an additional user verification step in hybrid implementations on iOS and Android.\nHere’s how this plays out on a Meta Quest with the Meta Horizon mobile app:\n\n1. The Hybrid Flow Message Is Generated\nWhen a passkey login is initiated on the Meta Quest, the headset’s browser locally constructs the same payload that would have been embedded in a QR Code – including a fresh ECDH public key, a session-specific secret, and routing information used later in the handshake. Instead of rendering this information into an image (QR code), the browser encodes it into a FIDO URL (the standard mechanism defined for hybrid transport) that instructs the mobile device to begin the passkey authentication flow.\n2. The Message Is Sent to the Companion App\nAfter the FIDO URL is generated, the headset requires a secure and deterministic method for transferring it to the user’s phone. Because the device cannot present a QR code, the system leverages the Meta Horizon app’s authenticated push channel to deliver the FIDO URL directly to the mobile device. When the user selects the passkey option in the login dialog, the headset encodes the FIDO URL as structured data within a GraphQL-based push notification. \nThe Meta Horizon app, signed in with the same account as the headset, receives this payload and validates the delivery context to ensure it is routed to the correct user. \n3. The Application Sends a Notification of the Login Request\nAfter the FIDO URL is delivered to the mobile device, the platform’s push service surfaces it as a standard iOS or Android notification indicating that a login request is pending. When the user taps the notification, the operating system routes the deep link to the Meta Horizon app. The app then opens the FIDO URL using the system URL launcher and invokes the operating system passkey interface.\nFor users that have the notification turned off or disabled, launching the Meta Horizon app directly will also trigger a query to the backend for any pending passkey requests associated with the user’s account. If a valid request exists (requests expire after five minutes), the app automatically initiates the same passkey flow by opening the FIDO URL.\nOnce the FIDO URL is opened, the mobile device begins the hybrid transport sequence, including broadcasting the BLE advertisement, establishing the encrypted tunnel, and producing the passkey assertion. In this flow, the system notification and the app launch path both serve as user consent surfaces and entry points into the standard hybrid transport workflow.\n4. The App Executes the Hybrid Command\nOnce the user approves the action on their mobile device, the secure channel is established as per WebAuthn standards. The main difference is the challenge exchange timing:\nThe inaccessible device generates the standard WebAuthn challenge and waits.\nThe mobile authenticator, initiates the secure BLE/NFC connection.\nThe challenge is transmitted over this secure channel.\nUpon UV success, the mobile device uses the relevant key material to generate the AuthenticatorAssertionResponse or AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.\nThe response is sent back to the inaccessible device.\nThe inaccessible device then acts as the conduit, forwarding the response to the relying party server to complete the transaction, exactly as a standard display-equipped device would.\nImpact and Future Direction\nThis novel implementation successfully bypasses the need for an on-device display in the cross-device flow and still complies with the proximity and other trust challenges that exist today for cross-device passkey login. We hope that our solution paves the way for secure, passwordless authentication across a wider range of different platforms and ecosystems, moving passkeys beyond just mobile and desktop environments and into the burgeoning world of wearable and IoT devices. \nWe are proud to build on top of the excellent work already done in this area by our peers in the FIDO Alliance and mobile operating systems committed to this work and building a robust and interoperable ecosystem for secure and easy login.\nThe post No Display?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we build tools that help teams work with complex systems in a more productive and enjoyable way. As AI becomes part of everyday workflows, a new challenge is emerging for data teams: How can you enable AI-assisted analytics without sacrificing accuracy, transparency, or control over data?\nToday, we’re introducing Databao, a new data product from JetBrains designed to bring reliable semantic context to data teams, with the ability to build your own AI agents on top of it. We’re aiming to build an AI-native analytics tool that business users can rely on, alongside the dashboards that teams use every day.\nAs part of this work, we invite data teams to get in touch with us and launch a Proof of Concept to enable self-serve analytics for business users, discuss your team needs and share feedback throughout the journey. \n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nWhy Databao?\nDatabao’s mission\nModern data workflows are evolving quickly. Teams need flexibility and scalability as AI becomes a core part of how insights are generated. Sharing and reusing domain context, trusting AI-generated results, and scaling analytics without increasing complexity are some of the main challenges for companies.\nDatabao was built to solve practical problems that data teams face nowadays:\nEnabling business users to ask their own data questions in plain language.\nRelying on consistent, governed business definitions across analyses.\nGetting more accurate, repeatable results from AI-assisted workflows.\nReducing manual back-and-forth and ad-hoc requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, this means enabling personalized, self-service analytics that are controllable, scalable, and continuously improve over time.\nProviding a self-maintaining semantic layer for companies’ data\nDatabao’s CLI tool, the context engine, is designed to extract schema and metadata from data sources and give teams a governed layer that captures business logic and definitions from databases, BI tools, and documentation. This keeps context consistent and reusable.\nAs one of our Alpha users puts it:\n“Before the context engine, I had to copy and paste my database schema into the LLM. Now I just point it to the data source and ask it to generate a query – and it works. No more incorrect column types, format mismatches, or hallucinations.”\nEnabling agentic analytics\nIn addition to the context engine, the data agent, available as an open-source and local Python SDK, uses this context to enable users to query, clean, and visualize enterprise data, generating production-quality SQL and outputs that business users can trust.\nAnother of our early users shared: “The Databao agent joined three to four tables perfectly, which no other data agent can do. I’m literally happy with this.”\nThe platform that brings it all together\nDatabao is designed for teams and the people who implement and own data tooling: analytics leads, data engineers, and platform teams.\nIt starts with a simple local setup and grows naturally as usage and complexity increase. From the first open-source building blocks, we are now evolving into a team-ready SaaS layer that brings shared context, collaboration, and production-grade reliability.\nBy avoiding vendor lock-in, working across tools, and adapting to different organizational setups, we also aim to make our platform suitable for any production environment, not just for experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nDatabao’s trust milestones\nOver the past year, we’ve focused on understanding how structured context and a semantic layer can improve the accuracy of agentic answers. This research has informed the foundations of Databao and how we started building our product.\nAs a result, we recently reached two important milestones: achieving a first-place ranking in the DBT track of the SPIDER 2.0 Text-to-SQL benchmark – one of the most widely recognized evaluations for SQL generation – and joining the Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), an open-source initiative led by Snowflake and other industry leaders to define a shared, vendor-neutral standard for semantic models.\nLet’s turn AI analytics into a working POC, together\nWe are excited to invite teams to build a proof of concept together with the Databao team. We’ll work with you to understand your use case, define a context-building process, and give the agent access to a selected group of business users. Together, we’ll then evaluate the quality of the responses and overall satisfaction with the results.\n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nAnd if you’d like to explore Databao, you can already try both our context engine and data agent through our open-source libraries.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we love seeing the developer community grow and thrive. That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference – the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this edition of the Open Source in Focus blog posts series, we spotlight four projects across the .NET ecosystem – each is a good reminder that developer experience is what makes ambitious projects sustainable over time.\nAvalonia UI: Cross-platform .NET UI toolkit\nAvalonia is an open-source, cross-platform UI framework for building .NET applications. It was launched in 2013 as an attempt to reimplement WPF as an open-source project and has grown steadily over time. The team notes it started gaining mindshare in 2021 and has continued to see significant adoption growth since then.\nOur contributors work on all supported desktop platforms: we have some working on macOS full time, some on Linux, and some on Windows. The only IDE that works on all of these platforms is JetBrains Rider. It’s an additional bonus that Rider also has the best Avalonia XAML support out there.\nSteven Kirk, Avalonia creator\nWhat’s next: The team’s goal is to keep pushing Avalonia to be “the leading .NET UI toolkit.” They’ve recently released Avalonia Accelerate with phased rollout plans – the first phase includes new Developer Tools, Media Player, and native WebView controls. Later phases will include a packaging tool, a GUI designer, and more. The team is also working on v12, with more news expected in the coming months.\nMudBlazor: .NET-first Blazor component library\nMudBlazor started when its founders were contributing to other Blazor component libraries and ran into architectural limitations and instability – coding felt like fighting against hidden JavaScript logic, and there was no extensive unit test coverage. \nThe creators set out to build a developer-friendly .NET component library, with most functionality written in C#, using JavaScript only when absolutely necessary. The result is a library with 90% test coverage, designed to be stable, well-tested, and easy to debug.\nReSharper has been incredibly helpful in spotting issues in MudBlazor: NullReferenceExceptions, unused values, expressions that are always null, etc. I rely heavily on the Unit Test Explorer and Localization Manager.\nAdditionally, dotMemory and dotPeek have been invaluable tools for us, especially in tricky cases when users report performance issues or large memory usage. These tools were particularly helpful in improving the performance of our popover system, which had previously experienced problems.\nArtyom Melnikov, MudBlazor maintainer\nFor me personally, ReSharper with its included test runner is the most important tool when working on MudBlazor. It’s a huge productivity booster, as it automatically adds usages, suggests simplifications, highlights unused code, and underlines potential errors. I use it extensively for refactoring whole files or projects. My favorite key combination is Ctrl+T, which lets you jump to a certain type. In a big source base like MudBlazor, this saves a huge amount of time.\nAlso, dotCover played a huge role for us in our efforts to increase test coverage. I used it to discover untested code regions and to measure the coverage of methods, classes, or entire modules quickly and effectively.\nMeinrad Recheis, MudBlazor co-creator\nWhat’s next: The team describes MudBlazor as “very mature”, with an emphasis on keeping complexity limited and the library maintainable by a small team. They expect substantial refactoring ahead to address internal design issues – and say they can do it safely thanks to ReSharper and high test coverage.\nLINQ to DB: LINQ-based data access library\nThe first code that eventually became LINQ to DB dates back to 2002. It started as a simple object mapper and later evolved into a library called BLToolkit. After LINQ support arrived in .NET, the team built a custom LINQ provider and, in 2012, redesigned the approach by extracting the LINQ-related parts into a standalone library: LINQ to DB, which is now a mature, high-performance data access library.\nJetBrains IDEs play a critical role in our daily workflow. Rider and ReSharper help us keep our large and complex codebase clean and consistent. Their static analysis, code inspections, and navigation features make it easy to spot issues early and refactor safely. They’re especially helpful when dealing with complex expression tree transformations and query generation logic. \nDataGrip is our go-to tool for interacting with databases during development and debugging. Its support for multiple RDBMSs and rich SQL capabilities align perfectly with LINQ to DB’s multi-database nature, making testing and validation much smoother. \nFor testing and performance, we rely on dotCover to ensure our unit tests provide thorough coverage of edge cases and expression scenarios. dotMemory helps us detect and fix memory leaks and inefficiencies, which is especially important for long-running data operations. dotTrace has been instrumental in turning LINQ to DB into the high-performance library it is today. Without it, we simply couldn’t have optimized the expression translation pipeline and query execution paths to the level they are at now.\nIgor Tkachev, LINQ to DB creator\nWhat’s next: The team is working on improving the expression tree translation engine to support more advanced LINQ constructs and custom expressions. Better diagnostics, deeper Roslyn-based source generation, and more consistent cross-database behavior are also on the roadmap. Long-term, the team aims for tighter integration with modern .NET features and better usability in async and high-throughput scenarios – without compromising performance.\nPeachPie: PHP compiler for .NET\nPeachPie (originally called Phalanger) began nearly 20 years ago as an experimental effort to translate PHP into Common Intermediate Language and run it on the .NET runtime, with the hypothesis that this could improve performance and security. Today, the team notes that people use PeachPie for hybrid apps in PHP and C#, including scenarios like WordPress on the frontend with a C# backend in a single project.\nWe’re experimenting with Rider, trying to support PeachPie PHP/.NET applications in the IDE, providing IntelliSense, design-time analyses, debugging via CLR Debugger, etc.\nJakub Míšek, PeachPie creator\nWhat’s next: Future development is focused on big-picture milestones, such as getting Laravel or Symfony to run on .NET, supported by the smaller functionality, library work, and bug fixes needed along the way.\nFrom our perspective, the most encouraging pattern across these stories is how much maintainability depends on everyday developer ergonomics: safer refactors, strong diagnostics, fast navigation, and tooling that helps teams validate changes with confidence. \nIf you’re using any of these projects, consider sharing feedback, filing an issue, or contributing a small improvement – Rider is free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute. \nMore from this series",

It can be run in the cloud, executed from a Docker container, integrated into CI/CD pipelines, or invoked through a JetBrains IDE.\nQodana already offers an impressive suite of inspections, but it is not limited to what comes built in. You can add custom inspections to enforce project specifics and conventions.\nFor example, imagine a project with a specific code convention:\nEach Kotlin class in a service package must have a Service suffix.\nIn this case, com.jetbrains.service.JetComponent would not conform to this convention, while com.jetbrains.service.BrainComponentService would be perfectly fine. In what follows, we’ll build a plugin that implements this inspection, allowing Qodana to enforce this convention in future projects.\nWe can implement this code convention by creating a custom code inspection packaged in a plugin. Qodana plugins are developed just like JetBrains IDE plugins, which is to say we simply need to create an IntelliJ Platform plugin that can be run in Qodana. Here’s a quick overview of the steps we’ll take:\nInitialize the project from the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template.\nAdjust the project properties and plugin descriptor along with necessary dependencies.\nDeclare the local inspection in the plugin descriptor and implement it in Kotlin.\nBuild and package the plugin.\nIn the example playground project, put the plugin artifact into a proper directory.\nAdjust the Qodana configuration file.\nRun Qodana and look at the report!\nPreparing the plugin project\nTo bootstrap the project, visit the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template repository and click the Use this template button to create a plugin repository. Name it classname-inspection-qodana-plugin, copy the project URL, and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. When the project is ready, customize gradle.properties by declaring the pluginGroup, pluginName, and pluginRepositoryUrl as necessary. Remember to click the Sync Gradle Changes floating button to apply the changes. To modify the unique plugin identifier, change the id element in the plugin descriptor plugin.xml.\nDeclaring dependencies\nOur code inspection targets Kotlin classes, so we need to add the Kotlin plugin to the Qodana plugin’s dependencies. The gradle.properties file requires you to declare:\nplatformBundledPlugins = org.jetbrains.kotlin\nIn addition, the plugin descriptor plugin.xml must contain the same bundled Kotlin plugin in its dependencies:\n<depends>org.jetbrains.kotlin</depends>\nAgain, remember to sync Gradle changes by clicking the floating button.\nIn addition, the Kotlin class inspection needs to support the Kotlin K2 Compiler, which has been enabled by default since version 2025.1 of the IntelliJ Platform. In the plugin descriptor, declare the org.jetbrains.kotlin.supportsKotlinPluginMode extension.\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"org.jetbrains.kotlin\">\n    <supportsKotlinPluginMode supportsK2=\"true\" />\n</extensions>\nCreating the code inspection\nThe actual code for any code inspection that targets Kotlin classes requires three steps:\nDeclare a com.intellij.localInspection extension in the plugin descriptor along with the necessary attributes and a fully qualified reference to the implementation class.\nCreate an implementation class, preferably in Kotlin.\nProvide a standalone HTML file with an inspection description, usage guidelines, and an example.\nDeclaring the extension\nAdd the following declaration to the plugin.xml plugin descriptor file:\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <localInspection\n        language=\"kotlin\"\n        implementationClass=\"org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\"\n        enabledByDefault=\"true\"\n        displayName=\"SDK: Discouraged class name\"\n        groupName=\"Kotlin\"\n    />\n</extensions>\nThe language attribute indicates that the inspection applies to Kotlin source code files. It is important to explicitly enable the inspection by default; otherwise, Qodana will not run it. Then provide a human-readable descriptive displayName to be shown in the report and settings. The groupName attribute sets the inspection category that is shown both in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings. Finally, provide a fully qualified name for the implementation class.\nCode inspection source code\nThe Kotlin plugin provides a useful base inspection class for Kotlin inspections: AbstractKotlinInspection. Override the buildVisitor method and provide a PSI visitor instance that traverses the Kotlin class elements in a type-safe way. classVisitor is a convenient DSL-like function that returns this kind of PSI visitor and is invoked on any Kotlin class in the project you’re inspecting.\npackage org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection\n\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemHighlightType\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemsHolder\nimport com.intellij.psi.PsiElementVisitor\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeinsight.api.classic.inspections.AbstractKotlinInspection\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClass\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtVisitorVoid\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.classVisitor\n\nclass ServicePackageClassNameInspection : AbstractKotlinInspection() {\n    override fun buildVisitor(holder: ProblemsHolder, isOnTheFly: Boolean) = classVisitor { klass ->\n        val classNamePsi = klass.nameIdentifier ?: return@classVisitor\n        val classFqn = klass.fqName?.asString() ?: return@classVisitor\n        if (klass.packageLastComponent == \"service\" && !classFqn.endsWith(\"Service\")) {\n            holder.registerProblem(\n                classNamePsi,\n                \"Class name in the 'service' package must have a 'Service' suffix\"\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val KtClass.packageLastComponent: String\n        get() = containingKtFile.packageFqName.shortName().asString()\n}\nThe visitor subclass extracts the fully qualified Kotlin class name, inspects the rightmost package element, and checks the corresponding suffix. Any improper class name is reported to the ProblemsHolder instance with an enclosing class as a PSI element and a human-readable problem description.\nInspection description\nEach local inspection requires a companion description file, represented as HTML. If you use the Create description file ServicePackageClassNameInspection.html quick-fix, a file named src/main/resources/inspectionDescriptions/ServicePackageClassName.html will be created in the proper location. You’ll also have to provide a description that will be shown in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings.\n<html>\n<body>\nReports class names in the <code>service</code> packages that lack the <code>Service</code> suffix.\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<pre><code>\n  package com.example.foo.service\n  class SomeComponent {\n    /* class members */\n  }\n</code></pre>\n</body>\n</html>\nBuild the plugin\nYou’re all set – time to build! Execute the buildPlugin Gradle task and look at the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip artifact available in the Gradle output directory. The JAR file will be used as the primary artifact in the Qodana scan. \nKeep the plugin artifact type in mind\nQodana does not directly support local ZIP plugin artifacts that include additional JAR archives or third-party dependencies. Any plugin needs to be packaged as a single JAR or unzipped into a specific directory.\nRun Qodana on a playground project\nLet’s create a playground project, written in Kotlin, that we can inspect with Qodana now that we’ve extended it with our plugin. To run the Qodana plugin locally, make sure that two software components are available on your system:\nDocker\nQodana CLI\nOur playground project should contain a class called src/main/kotlin/org/intellij/sdk/qodana/service/SomeComponent.kt, which does not follow our code convention, as it does not have the Service suffix. There are two ways to integrate the Qodana plugin into Qodana:\nPublish it on JetBrains Marketplace\nFor quicker turnaround, put the plugin’s JAR artifact into your project’s .qodana directory.\nTo simplify the build, copy the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file from the plugin project to the .qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file in the playground project. Create the .qodana directory, if it does not yet exist. Then extract the archive with your preferred program or tool. Qodana is able to access the plugin in the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection directory.\nIn addition, Qodana needs to be configured to include our custom code inspection. Change the qodana.yaml file in the root directory of the playground project as follows:\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\ninclude:\n  - name: org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\nThe include block needs to refer to the fully qualified class name of the code inspection available in the plugin. Now execute the following command to run Qodana from the terminal:\nqodana scan --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/qodana-code-inspection\nThis will download the corresponding Qodana Docker image. A Docker container will be created and run based on the Qodana configuration. To make the custom plugin accessible inside the Qodana run, mount the Qodana plugin directory from the local filesystem to the appropriate directory inside the Qodana Docker container. After a couple of minutes, Qodana will produce a report summary and print it to the standard output.\nQodana - Detailed summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nAnalysis results: 1 problem detected                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nBy severity: High - 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nName                           Severity  Problems count                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nSDK: Discouraged class name    High      1                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------\nOpen the full report in your browser:\n  Do you want to open the latest report [Y/n]Yes\n\n!  Press Ctrl+C to stop serving the report\n\n\\  Showing Qodana report from http://localhost:8080/... (10s)\nQodana will show that SomeComponent does not conform to the code convention provided by our local inspection in the Qodana plugin.\n\n\n\n\nTips for future runs\nWhen the Qodana plugin is modified and rebuilt, the Qodana cache needs to be recreated as well. In such cases, use the --clear-cache CLI switch to reload all of the Qodana run’s dependencies.\nqodana scan --clear-cache --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.jar:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/codeinspection.jar\nPlugging Qodana into your IDE\nThe Qodana plugin can be installed from disk into the IDE. Its code inspection is then automatically enabled and invoked for any Kotlin class in a project. To check that it’s working, revisit the playground project, open the org.intellij.sdk.qodana.service.SomeComponent class, and make sure that the problematic class name is underlined. As a convenience, hovering the mouse on the class name will show the code inspection result along with the problem description. Alternatively, you can open the Problems tool window and find the problem in the list of all problems reported by code inspections. \nThe code inspection now behaves like any other inspection provided by the IDE. In Settings | Editor | Inspections | Kotlin, you’ll find the SDK: Discouraged class name inspection, along with the description sourced from the HTML file that we provided before.\nRunning Qodana within the IDE\nWith the plugin installed, you can now run Qodana from your IDE as well. In the Problems tool window, go to the Qodana tab, and click the Try Locally button. Qodana will be configured with the qodana.yaml file and run. The Qodana report can be found directly in the tool window. \n\n\n\n\nQodana plugins and JetBrains Marketplace\nProperly built and tested custom inspection plugins can be published on JetBrains Marketplace, removing the need to serve them from the .qodana directory. Instead, you just need to make sure that the Qodana configuration specifies a public plugin identifier that matches the id element in the plugin descriptor.\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\nplugins: \n  - id: com.github.novotnyr.qodanacodeinspection\nQodana’s scan command is simplified, as the .qodana directory mount is no longer necessary.\nqodana scan\nQodana downloads this plugin from JetBrains Marketplace and runs all its inspections, producing both console output and an HTML report that can be shown in a web browser.\nSummary\nWe have created a Qodana plugin with a code inspection that checks for a specific code convention, and we have a handful of ways to run it:\nAs a JAR placed in the .qodana directory and included in the Qodana YAML file.\nAs a reference to the publicly available plugin on JetBrains Marketplace.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is applied in a local Qodana run.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is included among the integrated code inspections. \nSee the IntelliJ SDK Code sample for concise examples of both the Qodana plugin and a playground project",

There are fewer distractions and fewer launches, which makes it the ideal time to slow down and take a look at what is actually driving the tech world at the moment.\nThis issue leans into that calm, with Trisha Gee joining us as our featured content guest and sharing her thoughts and observations on the latest Java news and how it’s shaping developers’ lives. We explore where Java is heading next, what running on the latest LTS really means, and how the platform keeps improving without chasing hype. Add in some practical tutorials, Kotlin updates, AI gradually becoming capable of more and more everyday development tasks, and a few thoughtful takes along the way, and you have a February read that is relaxed in tone, but rich in ideas. \nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha Gee is a Java Champion, author, and internationally recognized speaker with over two decades of experience in software development. Known for her deep expertise in Java, high-performance systems, and developer productivity, Trisha has worked as a developer and leader in organizations ranging from startups to global enterprises. She’s passionate about sharing knowledge and helping developers write more expressive and efficient code.\nTrisha is the author of multiple technical books, including Head First Java (3rd Edition) and Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA, and she frequently contributes to developer communities through blogs, webinars, and international conferences. She’s also a strong advocate for grassroots learning and regularly supports local user groups and meetups to help developers connect, grow, and thrive. When she’s not writing or coding, she’s championing inclusive practices and mentoring the next generation of developers.\nHappy February, dear readers of Java Annotated Monthly! For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the words “Happy” and “February” do not usually go together. However, I do see the upside of the dark months of January and February, mostly in that things are fairly quiet, travel (for me) is usually limited, and it’s a time to take stock of how you want the rest of the year to go.\nSo let’s look at Java (weird, for a Java newsletter). We now know the list of features coming in Java 26. Java 25, the current version, is the latest LTS, so although you may not be ready to look at Java 26 yet, you should be running on Java 25. It’s incredible to me that Java is still evolving after all these years, and in elegant and useful ways. In Data-Oriented Programming for Java: Beyond Records, Brian Goetz talks about how data can best be represented in Java, and specifically what carrier classes are. I’m always fascinated by how the language evolves and how the engineers decide which features to add or update (like records or carrier classes). If you are too, you should watch this interview with Georges Saab. He also talks about the value of learning (I learned fairly recently that “Hello World” in Java is much simpler to write thanks to new language features). Watch Marit demonstrate them in IntelliJ IDEA. And if you are keen to expand your IntelliJ IDEA/JetBrains IDE knowledge to expert level, maybe you’ll be interested in JetBrains’ Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA full-day workshop, which is led by me!\nI mentioned travel earlier in this piece – sadly I will not be going to JavaOne this year, which is super disappointing. JavaOne is where I got started with presenting at conferences, and it’s a place where I always meet interesting people, whether they are speakers, engineers working on Java itself, Java Champions, Java User Group leaders, or attendees there to learn something new. Tickets are still available, so I recommend taking a look.\nThat’s all from me! Remember, February is short, and it’ll be spring soon.\nJava News\nFresh releases, future plans, and the inside story from the Java team.

It’s becoming part of the core toolchain. As usage increases, so does the need for clarity. Leaders need to understand how AI is used, how it affects day-to-day work, and how to manage it responsibly in an organization.\nAs a first step, these new capabilities are designed to provide that clarity, with governance and observability built in from the start. We will continue to further develop AI governance functionalities to provide even greater transparency.\nCentralized AI governance across teams\nOrganizations can now use the JetBrains Console to manage AI usage and costs at the company or team level. In the AI settings section, you can:\nEnable AI on the organization or team level.\nControl access to AI tools and agents, including Junie, Claude Agent, and OpenAI Codex.\nManage a shared pool of AI Credits.\nSet default and per-user credit limits.\nConfigure data collection options.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce enabled, AI capabilities are available directly inside developers’ JetBrains IDEs, with no additional setup or workflow changes required. This makes it possible to roll out AI incrementally and avoid ungoverned usage.\n\n\n\n\nManaging AI Credits and licenses\nAs AI usage grows, visibility into licenses and consumption becomes critical.\nThe Users and licensing tab in the AI management section provides a single view of:\nLicense availability and assignment throughout the organization.\nIncluded AI Credit usage.\nRemaining top-up credits.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmins can assign licenses that include AI Credits, such as AI Pro, AI Ultimate, All Products Pack, and dotUltimate, to individual users. Access can be granted or restricted as needed, with changes taking effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\nFor teams or individuals with higher usage needs, additional AI Credit limits can be configured per user or applied in bulk. This allows organizations to support power AI users without removing default values in the company.\n\n\n\n\nObservability into AI usage and adoption\nAI adoption rarely looks the same across teams. Some developers integrate it deeply into their workflow, while others use it occasionally or not at all.\nThe console provides clear visibility into how AI is used throughout the organization, helping you understand adoption patterns and plan budgets better.\nTrack AI adoption and engagement over time\nThe Active AI users chart shows how many developers actively use AI, making it easier to understand adoption trends and engagement levels across teams. You can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nMonitor AI Credit consumption\nAI Credit usage can be analyzed over any time period, both for credits included in your AI license and top-up credits. This data supports more informed planning around budgets and usage limits.\n\n\n\n\nSpot when developers reach their AI Credit limits\nThe console also shows how frequently users reach their monthly AI Credit limits. This makes it easier to identify friction points and adjust limits where needed, whether at the team or individual level.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how AI influences development work\nBeyond usage and cost, the console provides early insights into how AI is used and received by developers. The AI activity and impact charts are intended to support comparison and informed decisions. \nIn upcoming releases, we will introduce more advanced metrics and API access to help organizations assess the impact of AI on engineering and business outcomes.\nAcceptance of AI-generated code\nThe AI-generated code and acceptance rate charts show how often AI-generated code is accepted by developers and act as indicators of quality and relevance.\nYou can use this data to compare the tools or agents you have integrated into AI Assistant (Junie, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and others that will be supported in the future). This helps you identify where suggestions consistently fall short of expectations and decide where configuration, enablement, or tool choice should be revisited. \nYou can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nAI-modified code\nThe AI-modified code charts highlight the relative footprint of different AI tools and features within the codebase.\nThis helps teams understand exactly where AI is making meaningful contributions to development.\n\n\n\n\nAI feature activity\nThe AI feature activity chart shows how developers interact with AI inside the IDE, including chat usage and suggestion volume.\nThese insights help distinguish experimentation from sustained use and identify mismatches between enabled capabilities and actual developer behavior.\n\n\n\n\nGet started\nAI management and analytics are now available at no additional cost to all commercial customers with AI licenses via the JetBrains Console. Access is role-based, allowing organizations to define who can manage AI settings, view usage and adoption data, and assign licenses. \nTo get started, open the AI management section in the JetBrains Console. For more details, refer to the documentation or visit the AI for Business page.\n\n\n\n    \nExplore JetBrains Console now\n                                                    \nWe’re working to further enhance AI management and governance capabilities for organizations. Upcoming features include:\nCentralized Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) management for AI providers.\nMCP management for your organization.\nCentralized codebase indexing (RAG).\nAI guardrails and AI audit.\nMore advanced usage analytics dashboards and API access.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to stay updated on what’s next?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from version 2026.1, IntelliJ-based IDEs will run natively on Wayland in supported desktop configurations. This follows Wayland’s ascendance to the position of primary display server across contemporary Linux distributions.\nBy making this change in our EAP releases first, we hope to be able to give more Linux users the opportunity to try the native Wayland mode in their IDE, gather their feedback, and prepare more comprehensively for the general rollout in one of the upcoming major versions.\nWhat changes?\nInstead of running as X applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs will now automatically enable native Wayland support in a Wayland-capable desktop environment.\n\n\n\n\nSince the last preview in 2024.2, we have enhanced stability across several Wayland server implementations, added drag-and-drop functionality and input methods (IMs) support, and made a significant step towards native-looking window decorations.\nWayland differs profoundly from X11 in several technical ways. As a result, even though the user interface should largely look and feel the same, these underlying distinctions may be noticeable:\nSome windows and dialogs, e.g. Project Structure and Alerts, may not be centered on the screen or keep their previous location. This is due to the window manager having total control over windows’ locations in Wayland, which it is not always possible to override on the application side.\nThe splash screen on IDE startup will not appear as it cannot be reliably centered on the screen.\nSome popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\nWindow decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme.\n\n\n\n\nSome of these distinctions affect many Wayland users across other applications, and the Wayland community is actively addressing them. It is possible that they will be resolved in future versions of Wayland implementations and IntelliJ-based IDEs.\nX11 is still supported\nIn a Linux desktop environment that does not support Wayland, IntelliJ-based IDEs will continue to work as X applications. It is also possible to switch to using X11 on any Wayland desktop because an X.Org implementation called XWayland is always available for compatibility with older applications. To do that, add -Dawt.toolkit.name=XToolkit to the VM options list (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…) and restart the IDE.\nIs my IDE running in X11 or Wayland mode?\nIf you are curious about which mode your IntelliJ-based IDE is currently running in, you can find out by going to the About dialog (Help | About) and checking which toolkit is in use. Click on the Copy and Close button, and you’ll then see the toolkit’s name towards the top of the copied text:\nToolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nThis information is also available in idea.log; for example:\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nConfigurations supported in the future\nWayland support for Remote Development mode is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, Remote Development mode will continue to operate as before and not enable native Wayland support automatically.\nTechnical details\nNative Wayland support is mostly concentrated in one subsystem called WLToolkit. If you were one of the early adopters of this mode, you had to specify the -Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit VM option manually. This will continue to work, but it is no longer necessary.\nThe launcher will supply a new option to the IDE: -Dawt.toolkit.name=auto. The “auto” option will be resolved into either WLToolkit or XToolkit based on the following rule:\nIf wl_display_connect() succeeds, “auto” is replaced with WLToolkit, and therefore the application is launched in the native Wayland mode.\nOtherwise, “auto” is replaced with XToolkit, and the application is launched in X11 mode.\nLike every other aspect of JetBrains Runtime, the platform that powers IntelliJ-based IDEs, WLToolkit is fully open-source. JetBrains is also a key contributor to the OpenJDK project Wakefield, which is dedicated to ensuring that all Java applications execute natively on Wayland. New features and fixes are regularly published to the project’s GitHub repository. \nFeedback\nWe are very grateful for the dedication and valuable input from our users who participated in the Wayland Preview program. The time and effort you invested in reporting issues were instrumental, not only in identifying critical bugs but also in helping us accurately prioritize the roadmap for improvements and the implementation of key features.\nWe are pleased to announce that the upcoming version 2026.1 incorporates fixes for a substantial number of the reported problems. These fixes address a wide range of stability, performance, and desktop integration issues, marking a major milestone in the maturity of our Wayland support.\nThis major platform transition is a work in progress. We are actively investigating and developing fixes, prioritizing core areas like rendering, popups, window management, input methods (IMs), and desktop integration. Please subscribe to and vote for relevant issues for updates. Your patience and feedback are crucial as we work toward a stable, performant, modern, and feature-complete experience.",

POE 2 바알의 운명 리그\nPOE1 불길의 수호자 리그에서의 삿된 아이템 (고유템에서 특정 옵션 하나를 대체한 변성 아이템)에서 조금 더 틀어서, 확률이 더 들어갔고, 더블 커럽 (타락 2번으로, 홈 변경, 수치 변경, 옵션 부여가 최대 2번 가능)이 POE1 보다 편하게 도입되면서 재밌는 아이템이 많이 나왔다\n    \n물론 POE1보다 제한이 많은 역냉각, 그나마 공격은 흡수라도 되지만 주문 스킬 사용 시 코스트 제한이 큰 POE2의 제약을 풀어주는 계약 갑옷의 함양 옵션은 블러 메이지 어센던시가 얼마나 사기였는지 알 수 있었다.\n무한 불가능한 탈출, 히든 패시브 스킬 트리의 오라클도 재밌었고, 곰, 늑대, 와이번 드루이드도 꽤 재밌게 즐겼다.\n바알 사원이 POE1의 고난 리그 못지 않은 도파민 리그였고, 이를 막으려다가 롤백하는 등 사소한 이슈들이 있었지만, 역시 핵슬은 도파민이 리그 흥행에 도움이 된다는 것을 다시 한번 느끼게 됐다.\n    \n3. 디아블로 4 시즌 10\n오픈 베타 이후 아쉬움을 느껴 POE를 시작했고 라스트 에포크를 즐겼지만, 워낙 여러 영상에서 극찬이 많던 시즌이라 나도 즐기게 됐다.\n확실히 액트 구간을 빠르게 넘길 수 있고, 이로 인해 엔드 게임을 빠르게 진입할 수 있는 것은 장점이었지만, 직관적이고 빠르게 적응 가능한 시스템들도 많았던 데에 비해, 위상 같은 것은 번거롭기만 한 느낌도 지울 수 없었다.\n비약 같은 시스템은 MMORPG같은 느낌이 드는 버프도 있었는데, 또 어떤 부분은 핵슬의 기본 문법 스러운 포인트도 있고해서 나름 재밌게 즐겼다\n아이템 거래가 불편한 것만 아니었다면 좀 더 재밌게 즐겼을 듯\n    \n제발 거래소 좀..\n지향점 자체가 라이트한 핵앤 슬래시라는 게 느껴지긴 했으나, 그래도 좀 더 파고들기 요소가 있어야 되지 않을까?\n    \n올해의 워스트 게임\n1. POE 2 사냥의 서막\nPOE2 얼리억세스의 좋은 기세에 찬물을 끼얹은 시즌\n액트 시간이 단축되는 것을 못마땅하게 여겼는지, 가뜩이나 어렵던 액트 구간을 더 어렵게 만들었고, 이 과정에서의 이탈했고 나 역시 모든 POE2 시즌 중 일주일 남짓에 오프한 리그\n    \n특히 워리어 계열이 크게 고통 받았는데, 여러가지 반발이 많았고 이로 인해 허리띠에 호신부 슬롯 기본 부여, 전직 변경 가능을 비롯한 여러가지 개선이 이뤄진 전화위복 시즌이었다\n번개창으로 대동단결된 시즌이라, 시원시원하게 재밌게 즐긴 분도 많았겠지만, 시즌제 게임에서 초반이 얼마나 중요한지, 그 대응의 중요성도 느꼈던 시즌\n    \n2. 풋볼 매니저 26\n아직 버그가 너무 많다\n새로운 게임이 된 거 같지만, 잘 정돈되지 않은 느낌은 크게 아쉬웠음\n    \n할만은 하지만, 할만한 정도론 이전 버전을 플레이 하는게 낫지 않나 싶은 생각이 들었음\n        \n3. 몬스터 헌터 와일즈\n내가 굳이 언급하지 않아도 알겠지만, 여러 이슈로 인해 확장팩만 기다리는 사람이 산더미인 게임\n과연 확장팩에선 개과천선할 수 있을까?\n기억에 남는 게임\n1. 라스트 에포크 시즌 2, 3\n사실 아직 많이 모자르다\n    \n그래도 같은 직업군 내의 패시브를 혼합해서 찍을 수도 있고, 기본적 게임의 틀은 잘 완성된 형태여서 재밌게 즐겼다\n시즌 중에 발생한 거래소 한글 버그가 고쳐지지 않은 문제나, 패치마다 발생하는 소소한 버그가 너무 늦게 고쳐지는 이슈, 시즌 2 -3 간격도 빠른 편이라 보긴 어렵지만, 1-2의 간격, 3-4의 간격은 지나치게 길다는 점, 시즌 컨텐츠 양이 부족하다는 점 등은 아쉽다\n엔드 게임이 디아4보다는 풍부하지만 부족함이 많고, 컨텐츠 역시 갈길이 먼 측면이 있으며, 플레이 타임을 유지하기 위해서인지 한번 사용된 아이템은 각인되는데, 이로 인해 반복 노가다와 득템의 효율이 조금 아쉽다\n총평하자면 포텐은 증명했으나, 용이 되지 못했고, 발표한 플랜도 아쉬움이 크다.\n    \n그럼에도 관심을 놓자니 미련이 남는 게임\n        \n2. 토치 라이트 인피니트 SS10\n핵슬에 대한 이해도를 높일 겸사 겸사 시작했던 게임\n    \n널리 알려진거에 비해서 무료 캐릭으로 무료로 즐겨도 할만했음\n그래픽의 호불호는 나도 좀 있긴했지만, 생각보다 완성도 높은 게임이라서 놀라웠음\n왜 이 게임을 POE 다음 가는 수준의 깊이 있는 게임이라고 말하는지는 충분히 알았고, 이후에도 종종 타이밍 맞으면 즐길 게임\n    \n3. 엘더 스크롤 4 오블리비언 리마스터\n사실 원작이 발매됐던 시기에도 엑박버전이나 스팀 버전 등 여러번 샀음에도, 적응을 못하고 넘어갔었다\n이후 스카이림을 재밌게 즐겼으나, 굳이 구작을 즐기지 않았었는데 이번에 리마스터가 되면서 즐기게 됐다.\n아니 이런 명작을 놓쳤다니…? 이래서 오블리비언 오블리비언 얘기가 나왔고, 엘더 스크롤이 메이저 게임으로 한국에도 퍼진 계기였구나 싶은 감탄이 나왔던 게임\n올해의 영상\n1. 서울 자가에 대기업 다니는 김부장 이야기\n그 감정선이나 묘사가 너무 재밌었음\n나 역시 나이가 들어가는 입장에서 많이 공감되어야 하는거 아니냐고 말할 수도 있지만, 약간 과장되었거나, 공감이 안되는 내용이 꽤 있었다\n하지만 드라마로써의 완성도나 만족도는 충분했음\n    \n2. 중증외상센터\n여러 의학 드라마의 무게감보다 훨씬 명확하고 명쾌해서 좋았다\n    \n중증 외상 센터가 왜 필요한지에 대해서 알 수 있던 점은 덤\n깔끔한 전개로 즐겁게 볼 수 있었던 드라마\n    \n3. 경도를 기다리며\n오징어 게임의 세미역으로 나왔던 원지안 배우가 여주인공이었는데, 아주 매력적으로 나왔다\n약간 디테일은 많이 다르지만, 그 해 우리는 의 김다미 배우처럼, 작품과 딱 맞아떨어져 매력적으로 보였던 작품\n의외로 이런 저런 전개 과정이 멜로나, 로맨틱 코메디보다 재밌게 볼 수 있는 부분이 많아서 좋았다다\n올해의 아쉬운 드라마\n1. 오징어 게임 2, 3\n군계 일학이라 하나만 꼽겠음\n이유는 굳이 말 안해도 많은 사람들이 알거라 생각하지만…\n    \n무언가 기간 부족인지 1에 비해 떨어지는 디테일이 공감, 감정 이입을 방해했다\n        \n올해의 음악\n1. 프로미스 나인 - 하얀 그리움\n[fromis_9 (프로미스나인) - White Memories (하얀 그리움)\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251206방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyVxWRjSco&list=RDfXyVxWRjSco&start_radio=1)\n        \n알아듣기 힘든 노래 속에, 옛날 김민종님의 90-00 감성이 살아나는 노래를 잘 살렸다\n2. NMIXX - Blue Valentine\n[NMIXX (엔믹스) - Blue Valentine\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251018방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnUNpf0sgFE&list=RDVnUNpf0sgFE&start_radio=1)\n        \n이 노래 역시, 하얀 그리움처럼 잘 알아들을 수 있고 겨울 감성 살아있는 설레임 가득한 느낌이 드는 음악이어서 좋았다\n3. Behind the Moon - 밤의 끝자락\n밤의 끝자락 (Official Audio)\n시티팝? J-POP? 스러운 감성의 노래였는데 감성적으로 취향 저격이었음\n다만 Behind the Moon의 노래중 이 노래가 특히 좋았다는 점은 조금 아쉬웠음\n    \n김수영처럼 많은 노래가 비슷하게 취향 저격이었음 좋았을텐데…\n올해의 기술 주제\n1. LLM 쇼크, 바이브 코딩\nLLM의 발전이 기대보다 빠르게 진행되고 있다\n바이브 코딩과 함께 일정 수준 이하의 단순한 작업은 코드를 작성하지 않고도 가능해진 점은, 여러 분야의 생산성을 극대화 시킬 수 있는 부분이라고 보여진다\n물론 여전히 한계도 많고, 그 퀄리티의 제약도 많은 것은 당연한데, 이렇게 진행되다보면 개발자 무용론이 더 심해지지 않을까 우려도, 또 한편으로는 기회일 수도 있다는 생각도 든다\n    \n또 더 성장해야 된다는 생각 역시 들고 말이다\n        \n2. 메모리 가격 쇼크\n이게 왜 기술 주제냐하실 수 있는데, 메모리가 비싸지면 PC 시장이나, 서버 시장에도 영향을 줘서라고 말하고 싶다\n메모리 가격이 몇배씩 뛰면서, 게이머들의 PC 업그레이드 저항감은 더 커졌다\n    \n심지어 맥미니가 가성비라는 말 (원래도 어느정돈 그랬지만)이 더 공감을 얻고 있는데, 이러한 램 가격은 한동안 내려오지 않을 듯 하다\nSSD도 가격 인상중인데, 이 영향이 얼마나 커질까?\n또 게이머 관점에서도, 게임 개발자 관점에서도 PC 보급의 저항감이 낮아진 것은 우려가 되는 것은 사실이다\n    \n3. PostgreSQL의 강세, MySQL의 약세\n이러한 흐름은 몇년이나 지속 됐지만, 그 흐름이 더 커지는 명확한 시그널이 느껴진다\n오라클이 MySQL 커뮤니티, 개발을 유지할지에 대한 우려가 더 커지는 상황이 나오고 있고, 반면 PostgreSQL은 더 발전이 가속화 되는 상황이 이어지며, 이 흐름이 한국에서 얼마나 영향을 줄 지 궁금해진다.\n올해의 글\n1. AWS 버지니아 DDB 장애\nSummary of the Amazon DynamoDB Service Disruption in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region\n    \n실제 내가 서비스중인 프로덕트도 영향을 받았고, 이외에도 많은 제품이 영향을 받아 어떤 제품들이 AWS를 쓰고 있는지 알 수 있었음\n원인을 잘 설명해주긴 했으나, 결국 과도하게 복잡해진 시스템은 작은 오류도 복구가 쉽지 않아진다는 점은 크게 공감할 수 있었다\n        \n2. LLM과 함께라면 3달이 3일\nMariano Gappa’s Blog\n    \n사실 나 역시 토이 프로젝트나, 프로토타이핑 개발 시 단순한 기능의 구현이 떠오르지 않아 시간을 많이 소모한 일이 적지 않았다\n예를 들면, 그리드 기반 게임에서의 AStar라던지, 서버에서의 연산을 위한 경량 Raycast라던지, 투사체의 궤도라던지와 같은 로직들은 어떠한 동작을 원할 때 기능을 찾거나, 직접 구현하는 과정에서 많은 시간을 소모했다\n반면 이러한 수준의 작업은 아주 아주 쉬워진 상황이 나에게도 체감이 되고 있다.\n물론 상대적으로 게임은 바이브 코딩으로 최종 결과물이 안나오는 경우가 꽤 되지만, 이 역시 많이 해소 되고 있고, 더 가속화 될 거 같다.\n        \n다만 재미를 찾는 것은 여전히 사람의 영역이므로 이 부분에 경쟁력이 더 중요해져 가고 있다는 생각도 들었다\n            \n3. LLM 사용을 줄인 이유\nWhy I’m Dialing Back My LLM Usage — Zed’s Blog\n    \n요약하자면 보조적인 용도로 LLM을 써야 한다는 의미\n        \n나 역시 비슷한 의견을 가지고 있긴 하지만, 조금 더 그 생각을 명확히 드러내준 글이라고 볼 수 있겠다\nWhy I stopped using AI code editors · Luciano Nooijen\n    \n비슷한 의견\n        \nLLM을 사용하면 깊이 있는 생각과 통찰은 못 얻는 아쉬움을 대체하기 위해서, 기준을 정하고 사용한다는 의미\n            \n바이브 코딩으로 얻는 장단점을 명확하게 말한 듯 하다\n새해 바램\n건강\n다른 곳은 그래도 좀 괜찮았는데, 수면 장애랑 목이 너무 아프다\n    \n이 부분을 주기적으로 병원 가서 치료 받고 있지만, 아직은 좀 아파서 신경 쓰이는 상황\n        \n강아지\n초코가 그래도 많이 안아팠다\n    \n특히 돈은 많이 들어가고 있지만, 건강을 잘 챙기고 있게 되서 다행이다\n올해도 괜찮길\n파이는 여전히 건강하다\n    \n살만 안찌면 그래도 괜찮을 듯\n        \n여가 생활\n핵앤슬래시에 대한 이해가 크게 올라온 한해였다\n    \n대다수의 메이저 핵앤 슬래시를 모두 어느정도 수준까지 이해할 수 있게 됐다\n핵앤 슬래시 토이 프로젝트로 이어보고 싶은 개인적 바램이 있다\n        \n마치며\n매년 그렇듯, 건강도 잘 챙기고, 업무적 성취도 잘 이루고 싶다\n특히 매년 노력해온 건강, 토이 프로젝트와 함께 가족과의 시간도 더 잘 보내고 싶다\n핵앤 슬래시 게임을 로직적으로나 기획적으로는 어느정도 엿볼 수 있는 제품을 만들어보고 싶다\n다들 건강 잘 챙기시길!",

AI 기반 챗봇은 아주 논리적이고 효율적인 답변을 척척 내놓습니다. 하지만 경험 많은 인간 영업 담당자는 고객의 불안감을 감지하고, \"아, 많이 망설여지시죠? 충분히 이해합니다\"라며 그 감정을 먼저 인정해준 다음 차근차근 설득하죠. 결과는요? AI 챗봇은 거래 성사율이 낮은 반면, 인간 영업사원의 성약률은 훨씬 높다는 통계가 있습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "AI 기술의 눈부신 발전 속에서 우리 인류는 어떤 능력을 키워야 할까요? AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 5가지 핵심 특성과, AI와 상생하며 미래를 주도할 수 있는 새로운 마인드셋 전환에 대해 깊이 있게 탐구해 봅니다. 급변하는 시대에 흔들리지 않는 여러분만의 경쟁력을 찾는 여정에 함께해요!\n\n\n  AI 시대, 사라지지 않는 인간의 가치\n음, 여러분, 정말 놀랍지 않나요? 지금 이 순간에도 전 세계 수많은 직장에서 AI는 우리 일상의 많은 부분을 대신하고 있어요. 데이터 분석부터 문서 작성, 심지어는 복잡한 일정 관리까지, AI는 이 모든 것을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 처리해내죠. 그런데 여기서 정말 흥미로운 현상이 하나 나타나고 있더라고요. 바로 AI가 정해진 일을 더 빠르게 처리할수록, 역설적으로 인간의 고유한 가치가 더욱 빛을 발하고 있다는 점입니다.\n저 역시 처음엔 \"혹시 내 일자리도 AI에게 뺏기는 건 아닐까?\" 하는 불안감이 있었어요. 하지만 2026년 현재, 많은 기업과 조직들이 깨달은 건 AI 도입이 인간의 일자리를 없애는 것이 아니라, 어떤 능력을 갖춘 인간이 앞으로 더 필요한지를 명확하게 보여준다는 것이에요. 작년에 Workday가 전 세계 직원을 대상으로 진행한 설문조사를 보면, 무려 83%의 직원들이 AI가 오히려 인간 고유의 능력의 중요성을 높일 것이라고 동의했다고 해요. 세계경제포럼(WEF)도 2025년까지 65%의 일자리가 강력한 소프트 스킬을 요구하게 될 것이라고 예측했고요.\n그렇다면 우리 인간만이 가진, AI가 절대 대체할 수 없는 능력은 과연 무엇일까요? 오늘은 이 다섯 가지 핵심 특성에 대해 좀 더 깊이 있게 이야기해보려 합니다.\n❤️ 1. 공감 능력과 감정 지능\nAI는 감정을 진정으로 이해할 수 있을까요?\nAI가 할 수 있는 것, 참 많죠. 고객의 감정을 '감지'하고, 분노의 신호를 인식해서 특정 감정 상태를 분류하는 건 이제 식은 죽 먹기예요. 하지만 제가 겪어본 바로는, AI가 아무리 정교해져도 진정으로 타인의 감정을 이해하고 공감하는 일은… 글쎄요, 불가능에 가깝다고 생각합니다.\n챗봇이 \"안타깝습니다\"라는 문구를 보낸다고 해도, 우리는 본능적으로 그게 진정한 감정이 아니라는 걸 알죠. 기계는 우리처럼 희로애락을 느낄 수 없으니까요. 반면, 잘 훈련된 리더나 뛰어난 영업사원, 그리고 마음을 치유하는 상담가들은 상대방의 미묘한 표정 변화, 목소리 톤, 숨겨진 의미까지 포착해서 그 순간에 가장 적절한 반응을 보입니다. 바로 이게 진짜 '공감' 아닐까요?\n왜 AI 시대에 공감 능력이 더 중요해질까요?\nWEF의 2025년 보고서에 따르면, 직장인 82%가 AI 시대일수록 오히려 더 인간적인 연결을 갈망하고 있다고 해요. 특히 HR, 리더십, 고객 서비스, 교육, 의료 분야에서는 이런 수요가 정말 폭발적이죠.\n한번 이런 상황을 상상해볼까요? 어려운 구매 결정을 앞둔 고객이 있어요. AI 기반 챗봇은 아주 논리적이고 효율적인 답변을 척척 내놓습니다. 하지만 경험 많은 인간 영업 담당자는 고객의 불안감을 감지하고, \"아, 많이 망설여지시죠? 충분히 이해합니다\"라며 그 감정을 먼저 인정해준 다음 차근차근 설득하죠. 결과는요? AI 챗봇은 거래 성사율이 낮은 반면, 인간 영업사원의 성약률은 훨씬 높다는 통계가 있습니다. AI 시대의 경쟁력은 더 이상 데이터를 얼마나 빠르게 처리하는가가 아니에요. 고객이나 팀원의 감정을 얼마나 잘 읽고, 그에 맞춰 반응할 수 있는가가 핵심이 될 거라고 저는 확신합니다.\n\n\n\n  팁: 일상생활에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학 작품이나 영화를 통해 다양한 감정을 간접 경험하는 것도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n  2. 비판적 사고와 판단력\nAI는 데이터의 한계를 모릅니다\nAI는 정말 대량의 데이터를 분석해서 패턴을 찾고, 그럴듯한 결론을 제시하는 데는 탁월해요. 이건 정말 인정할 수밖에 없죠. 그런데 AI가 절대 할 수 없는 게 있습니다. 바로 그 데이터가 정말 맞는지 의심하고, 혹시 숨겨진 편향은 없는지 감지하고, 복잡한 상황에 맞는 최종 판단을 내리는 일입니다.\nAI 시스템이 어떤 권장안을 제시했다고 가정해봅시다. AI는 학습한 데이터 안에서는 이 권장안이 논리적으로 '가장 최적'이라고 자신할 거예요. 하지만 우리 인간은 다르죠. 비판적 사고를 가진 사람은 이렇게 질문을 던질 겁니다. \"이 데이터가 최신 정보인가?\", \"여기에 특정 집단에 불리한 편향은 숨겨져 있지 않을까?\", \"이 권장안이 다른 예상치 못한 변수들까지 고려했을까?\", \"과연 실제 현장에서도 통할까?\" 바로 이런 질문을 던지는 것이 진정한 비판적 사고의 시작점이라고 생각합니다.\nAI 시대에 비판적 사고가 필수인 이유\nMcKinsey 연구에 따르면, 2026년에는 AI 윤리 문제가 정말 폭발적으로 증가할 것으로 예상된다고 합니다. 자동화된 시스템이 내린 결정이 자칫하면 차별로 이어지거나, 개인정보 보호에 위협이 될 수도 있잖아요. 이런 문제들을 감시하고, 올바른 방향으로 이끌어갈 인간의 역할이 정말 필수적이라는 거죠.\n현재 AI가 데이터 분석의 절반이 넘는 51%를 담당하고 있다고 해요. 하지만 아무리 AI가 분석을 잘해도, 결국 누군가는 그 분석 결과를 검토해야 합니다. \"이게 정말 맞는가?\"라고 근본적인 질문을 던지고, 상황에 맞춰 최선의 판단을 내리는 것. 그것은 여전히 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 귀한 능력이라고 확신합니다.\n✨ 3. 창의성과 혁신\nAI는 조합할 뿐, 창조는 못 합니다\nGenerative AI가 그림을 그리고, 음악을 작곡하고, 심지어 시나 소설 같은 텍스트까지 써내는 모습을 보면 정말 대단하다는 생각이 들어요. 기존 패턴을 조합해서 새로운 결과물을 만들어내는 데는 능수능란하죠. 하지만 이런 AI의 결과물을 '창의성'이라고 부르기에는 저는 좀 위험하다고 봐요. 왜냐하면 AI의 모든 출력은 결국 학습 데이터의 통계적 최적화에 불과하거든요.\n진정한 창의성은 완전히 다른 이야기입니다. 예를 들어, 스티브 잡스가 음악 산업을 완전히 뒤집어 놓은 사례를 생각해봅시다. 그는 기존 음악 구조의 패턴을 단순히 조합한 것이 아니에요. 그는 \"음악은 어떻게 소비되어야 하는가?\"라는 정말 근본적인 질문을 던졌고, 그 질문에 대한 답으로 아이팟과 아이튠즈라는 새로운 패러다임을 창조했습니다. 기존의 규칙을 깨고, 세상을 변화시키는 이런 능력이 바로 진정한 창의성이죠.\n왜 2026년, 창의력이 더욱 중요할까요?\n세계경제포럼은 창의성이 2026년 AI 시대의 혁신을 정의할 핵심 요소라고 예측했습니다. 특히 R&D, 전략 기획, 신사업 개발 분야에서는 창의력 있는 인간 리더의 수요가 앞으로도 계속 증가할 것으로 보고 있어요.\n여기 재미있는 통계가 하나 있습니다. AI가 생성한 콘텐츠가 많아질수록, 역설적으로 '인간이 직접 만든 것'의 가치가 더 높아지고 있다는 사실이에요. 예술 시장, 패션 산업, 게임 개발 등 다양한 분야에서 모두 비슷한 현상을 보여주고 있죠. AI가 할 수 있는 것이 점점 더 많아질수록, 인간만이 만들 수 있는 진정한 창의성의 가치는 더욱 빛을 발할 거라고 저는 확신해요.\n\n\n ‍♀️ 4. 적응력과 회복력\nAI는 프로그래밍된 틀 밖으로 나갈 수 없습니다\nAI는 주어진 범위 내에서 정말 효율적으로 작동하고, 예상된 문제는 기가 막히게 잘 해결합니다. 그런데 말이죠, 예상하지 못한 상황에 맞닥뜨렸을 때, 빠르게 적응하고 완전히 새로운 방식으로 생각하는 일은 AI에게는 정말 어려운 일이에요.\n2020년 COVID-19 팬데믹을 한 번 떠올려볼까요? 세상이 갑자기, 정말 하루아침에 변했어요. 직장은 원격근무로 전환됐고, 고객의 수요는 급변했죠. 이 와중에 수많은 AI 시스템들은 학습 데이터에 없는 전례 없는 상황에 직면하며 혼란스러워했습니다. 하지만 우리 인간들은 어땠나요? 놀랍도록 빠르게 적응했습니다! 새로운 업무 방식을 배웠고, 새로운 도구를 익혔으며, 심지어 완전히 새로운 기회를 찾아 커리어를 전환한 사람들도 많았죠. 이게 바로 인간의 진정한 강점, 적응력과 회복력입니다.\n\"무엇을 아는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우는가\"가 중요한 시대\n변화의 속도는 정말이지 점점 더 빨라지고 있습니다. 기술 산업의 반감기(기술이 절반으로 쓸모없어지는 시간)는 지속적으로 단축되고 있고요. 이런 급변하는 환경에서는 솔직히, \"지금 무엇을 알고 있는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우고 새로운 것에 적응할 수 있는가\"가 훨씬, 정말 훨씬 더 중요하다고 저는 생각해요.\nWEF 연구에 따르면, 관리자급 직원의 65%가 적응력을 직원 유지의 핵심 요소로 평가했다고 합니다. AI는 기존 업무를 더 효율적으로 처리하도록 돕지만, 완전히 새로운 업무 영역으로 뛰어들 수는 없어요. 새로운 길을 개척하고, 불확실성 속에서 빛을 찾는 것은 여전히 우리 인간의 영역인 거죠.\n  5. 윤리적 판단과 신뢰 구축\nAI는 알고리즘만 따를 뿐입니다\nAI는 주어진 규칙을 정확하게 따르고, 프로그래밍된 원칙에 따라 아주 일관되게 행동합니다. 이건 정말 강점이죠. 하지만 도덕적 회색지대에서 섬세한 판단을 내리고, 복잡한 문화적 맥락을 이해하며, 무엇보다 사람과의 '신뢰'를 구축하는 일은 AI에게는 불가능에 가깝다고 저는 단언할 수 있습니다.\n윤리적 판단의 아주 중요한 예를 들어볼까요? 의료 현장에서 신약을 승인할지 말지 결정해야 하는 상황이 왔다고 칩시다. AI는 모든 임상시험 데이터를 분석해서 \"이 약은 80% 효과가 있고, 20%의 부작용이 있습니다\"라고 아주 명확한 결론을 내릴 수 있습니다. 그런데 우리 인간은 여기서 멈추지 않죠. 우리는 이렇게 질문할 겁니다. \"그 20%의 부작용은 생명에 치명적인가?\", \"이 약이 도움이 되는 집단은 누구이며, 고가의 약값이 소외 계층을 배제하지는 않을까?\", \"장기적인 부작용까지 충분히 고려되었는가?\" 이런 질문들에 답하려면 의학적 지식뿐만 아니라 윤리, 사회학, 인문학적 깊은 이해가 필요해요. AI는 여기서 한계를 드러낼 수밖에 없죠.\n신뢰가 곧 자산인 시대, 인간의 윤리적 판단이 필수입니다\n현재 AI가 모든 데이터 분석의 51%를 담당하고 있다는 것은, 바꿔 말하면 51%의 의사결정이 이미 자동화되었다는 뜻입니다. 하지만 Workday 연구에 따르면, 직장에서 가장 중요하게 여기는 인간적 능력 중 하나가 바로 윤리적 의사결정 능력이라고 합니다.\n신뢰는 어떤 조직이든 가장 기본적인, 그리고 가장 소중한 자산이죠. AI가 의사결정을 돕는 것은 맞지만, 최종 책임과 그에 따른 신뢰는 여전히 인간이 져야 합니다. 고객들은 알고리즘을 맹목적으로 신뢰하는 것이 아니라, 그 알고리즘을 설계하고 감시하는 우리 인간을 신뢰하니까요. 또한 전 세계 기업들이 직면한 'AI 윤리' 이슈는 차별 문제, 개인정보 보호, 환경 영향, 노동 문제 등 점점 더 복잡해지고 있어요. 이 모든 영역에서 우리 인간의 윤리적 판단력은 필수불가결한 요소라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  핵심 인사이트: AI 시대, 일자리는 '변한다'는 것을 기억하세요!\n뉴욕 타임스의 칼럼니스트 토마스 프리드먼(Thomas Friedman)은 이런 말을 남겼죠:\n\"AI가 너를 대체하지는 않겠지. 하지만 AI를 잘 쓰는 누군가가 너를 대체할 수도 있다.\"\n이 말은 정말 많은 의미를 담고 있어요. 제 생각에는 크게 두 가지로 해석할 수 있습니다.\n첫째, AI 기술 자체는 중립적이라는 거예요. AI가 어떻게 쓰이는지는 전적으로 우리 인간의 결정에 달려있다는 거죠.\n둘째, 앞으로의 경쟁력은 단순히 기술 하나만으로는 안 되고, 기술 + 인간 능력의 스마트한 조합에서 나온다는 점입니다. 기술만 뛰어나도 안 되고, 인간 능력만 뛰어나도 안 되는, 그런 시대가 온 거죠.\n ️ 2026년의 현실: 지금 당장 이 능력들을 키워야 하는 이유\n현재 많은 기업과 조직에서는 직원을 채용하거나 임금을 결정할 때, 기술 능력과 함께 인간 능력의 균형을 정말 중요하게 보고 있어요. 한 번 생각해볼까요?\n능력 기준\nA 직원\nB 직원\n\n\n\n\n기술 능력\n매우 높음\n평균 수준\n\n\n인간 고유 능력 (공감, 리더십, 적응력 등)\n평균 이하\n매우 뛰어남\n\n\n회사의 선택은?\n점점 더 B 직원을 선호하는 추세!\n\n\n\n왜냐고요? 기술은 정말 빠르게 변하지만, 우리 인간의 기본 능력, 그러니까 공감 능력, 비판적 판단력, 그리고 창의력 같은 것들은 시간이 지나도 그 가치를 잃지 않기 때문입니다. 오히려 그 가치는 더욱 커지고 있어요.\n당신이 지금 바로 해야 할 일들\n공감 능력을 키우세요: 일상에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학을 읽고, 영화를 보고, 다양한 배경의 사람들과 대화하며 시야를 넓히는 것도 좋습니다.\n의문을 던지는 습관을 가지세요: 주어진 정보를 무조건 받아들이기보다는 \"왜?\", \"이게 정말 최선일까?\", \"다른 관점은 없을까?\"와 같은 질문을 끊임없이 던지는 습관을 길러보세요.\n창의력을 개발하세요: 때로는 기존의 규칙을 깨어보고, 새로운 조합을 시도해보세요. 실패를 두려워하지 않는 용기가 중요합니다.\n변화를 즐기세요: 새로운 기술을 배우는 데 주저하지 말고, 새로운 업계를 탐험하고, 낯선 분야의 사람들과 네트워킹하며 끊임없이 성장하는 자신을 발견해 보세요.\n윤리 감각을 기르세요: 어떤 의사결정을 할 때든 \"이것이 과연 옳은가?\"라는 질문을 항상 던지고, 단기적인 이익보다는 장기적인 영향까지 깊이 생각하는 습관을 들이세요.\n  핵심 요약\nAI는 감정을 이해하고 공감할 수 없으므로, 인간적인 연결이 더욱 중요해집니다.\nAI는 데이터만 처리할 뿐, 비판적 사고와 상황에 맞는 판단은 인간의 몫입니다.\nAI는 기존 패턴을 조합하지만, 완전히 새로운 패러다임 창조는 인간의 창의력에 달려있습니다.\n급변하는 시대에 AI는 예측된 문제만 해결, 인간의 적응력과 회복력이 더욱 빛을 발합니다.\nAI는 훌륭한 도구이지만, 결국 그 가치를 극대화하는 것은 우리 인간의 고유한 능력임을 잊지 마세요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\nA1: 제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\nQ2: 소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\nA2: 네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\nQ3: AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\nA3: 창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\"}}]} \n  결론: AI와 인간, 경쟁이 아닌 협력의 미래!\nAI 기술의 발전은 이제 피할 수 없는, 우리 삶의 자연스러운 일부가 되었죠. 하지만 중요한 건, 이 기술이 결코 우리 인간을 완전히 대체하는 것이 아니라는 점입니다. 오히려 제가 오늘 말씀드린 것처럼 AI는 우리 인간만이 가진 고유한 가치를 더욱 선명하게 드러내고, 그 중요성을 부각시키는 강력한 도구가 될 거예요.\nWorkday의 글로벌 설문 결과도 이를 명확하게 보여줍니다. 83%의 직원들이 AI가 인간 고유의 능력을 더욱 중요하게 만들 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있었으니까요. 이제 우리는 질문을 바꿔야 할 때가 왔다고 생각합니다.\n\"AI가 나를 대체할까?\"\n라는 막연한 불안감 대신,\n\"나는 AI와 함께 무엇을 만들 수 있을까?\"\n라고 긍정적이고 미래지향적인 질문을 던져보는 거죠.\n여러분이 공감할 수 있고, 비판적으로 생각할 수 있으며, 새로운 것을 상상하고, 변화에 빠르게 적응할 수 있고, 마지막으로 옳은 선택을 할 수 있다면—이 다섯 가지 능력이 바로 여러분의 미래를 단단하게 보장해 줄 거라 저는 확신합니다.\n기억하세요. AI 시대의 진정한 경쟁력은 단순한 기술 지식이 아닙니다. 바로 인간다움, 그 자체에 있습니다.",

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `<Activity />` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등 v19에서 도입된 주요 기능들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/3-ways-to-build-forms-in-react)\r\r\n* [Building Reusable Components with

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Rust 전환 시 기존 대비 10-100배의 성능 향상이 가능하기 때문에, 복잡해진 프론트엔드 생태계에서 이 흐름은 이제 거스르기 어려워 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n가장 두드러진 성과를 내는 곳은 VoidZero로 보입니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다. '이게 좋다' 하면 모두가 몰려가고, '저게 정답이다' 하면 또 그쪽으로 쏠리는 흐름이 반복됐습니다. 그 와중에 인상 깊었던 LLM 사용 사례와 아티클, 도구를 정리해 공유합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI 코딩의 한계와 책임\r\r\n\r\r\nLLM 기반 개발의 한계점과 개발자 책임에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to \"write better code?\"](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)\r\r\n* [Why you shouldn't use AI to write documentation](https://zeroheight.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-documentation/)\r\r\n* [Why Your AI Coding Assistant Keeps Doing It Wrong, and How To Fix It](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)\r\r\n* [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\r\r\n* [dead framework theory](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/)\r\r\n* [How to Fix Any Bug](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기업 도입 사례\r\r\n\r\r\nSpotify, Airbnb 등 대규모 조직의 AI 도입 경험입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1,500+ PRs Later: Spotify’s Journey with Our Background Coding Agent (Part 1)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/spotifys-background-coding-agent-part-1)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b)\r\r\n\r\r\n### MCP와 컨텍스트 엔지니어링\r\r\n\r\r\nModel Context Protocol과 효과적인 AI 활용을 위한 컨텍스트 설계입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [MCP explained without hype of fluff](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/12/mcp-explained-without-hype-or-fluff)\r\r\n* [Chrome DevTools MCP Server](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp)\r\r\n* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\r\r\n* [Minification isn't obfuscation - Claude Code proves it](https://martinalderson.com/posts/minification-isnt-obfuscation-claude-code-proves-it/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI시대의 개발 방법론\r\r\n\r\r\nAPI 설계, 문서화, 추상화 등 AI와 함께하는 개발 방법론입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Design APIs for an AI World ](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world)\r\r\n* [Writing documentation for AI: best practices](https://docs.kapa.ai/improving/writing-best-practices/)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Conversation: LLMs and Building Abstractions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html)\r\r\n* [Attention Is the New Big-O](https://alexchesser.medium.com/attention-is-the-new-big-o-9c68e1ae9b27/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 유용한 도구\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 개발에 활용할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) - 전체 Repository를 AI 친화적인 단일 파일로 압축\r\r\n* [repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt) - GitHub Repository를 단일 텍스트로 변환, GUI 기반으로 파일 선택 가능\r\r\n* [ai-digest](https://github.com/khromov/ai-digest) - 코드베이스를 하나의 마크다운 파일로 생성\r\r\n* [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) - Claude 기반 AI 에이전트를 여러 개 연결해 협업, 복잡한 작업을 단계별 워크플로우로 자동화\r\r\n* [agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules) - Cursor, Claude Code 같은 AI 코드 어시스턴트에게 일관된 행동 지침을 적용하는 규칙 템플릿 모음\r\r\n* [Conductor](https://conductor.build/) - Claude Code를 여러 개 동시에 실행하며 관리하는 도구\r\r\n* [Terragon](https://www.terragonlabs.com/) - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex 등 AI 코딩 에이전트를 클라우드에서 병렬 실행\r\r\n* [react-grab](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) - 페이지의 모든 요소를 선택해 AI 코딩 에이전트에게 컨텍스트로 전달, 단일 스크립트 태그로 설치\r\r\n* [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) - GitHub에서 다양한 MCP 서버를 모아둔 레지스트리\r\r\n* [streamdown](https://streamdown.ai/) - AI Chat 서비스처럼 마크다운 스트리밍 렌더링 지원\r\r\n* [lean-spec](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec) - 경량 SDD(Spec-Driven Development) 프레임워크\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그 외 분야별 소식\r\r\n\r\r\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년도 JavaScript와 TypeScript 생태계는 활발하게 움직였습니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 미국에 한 10일 정도 갔다 왔다. 짧은 일정이었지만, 꽤 많은 업계 분과 투자자들을 만나서 요새 미국 tech 시장에서 어떤 일들이 일어나고 있고, 우리보다 훨씬 큰 투자자들은 어떤 생각을 하고 있고, 어떤 딜들을 보고 있고, 어떤 고민을 하고 있는지 들을 수 있었고, 동시에 많이 배울 수 있었다. 내가 이 글에서는 우리 같은 VC는 창업가에게 엄청 많이 배운다고 했는데, 이건 배움의 절반에 대해서만 이야기한 것 같다. 나머지 절반은 우리가 투자할 수 있게 소중한 자금을 제공해 주는 우리의 LP들에게 배우는 것 같다.\n아무래도 미국 벤처투자자들과 가장 많이 이야기했던 주제는 올해 예정된 스페이스엑스, 오픈AI, 그리고 앤쓰로픽의 IPO였는데 이 세 회사가 원하는 기업가치 총액은 거의 $3.5 trillion이다. 스페이스엑스가 공개적으로 이야기하는 기업가치가 $1.5T인데 이는 한국 GDP의 4분의 3이다. 정말 어마어마한 숫자이고 나도 이 일을 하면서 꽤 큰 금액에 대해 이야기하고 billion이라는 단어도 가끔 말하지만, trillion은 입에 담기조차 부담스러운 단위이다.\n요새 이 시장에선 billion과 trillion이라는 단위가 너무 남발되고 있고, 내가 느끼는 걸 영어로 표현해 보면 “$100 billion is the new $100 million(이제 1,000억 달러가 과거의 1억 달러다.)”이다. 솔직히 몇 년 전만 해도 미국의 대형 VC를 제외하곤 대부분의 VC가 $10B 밸류에 투자유치를 하는 회사들을 상당히 부담스러워했다. 일단 한화로 15조 원이라는 기업 가치 자체가 너무 컸고, 이 밸류에 투자하면 정말로 돈을 벌 수 있을지에 대한 의구심이 앞섰던 것 같다. 그리고 너무 비싸다는 불평을 계속하면서 아주 꼼꼼하고 깐깐하게 실사하고, 여러 번 고민했던, 그런 시절이 있었다.\n몇 년 전에는 전 세계에서 가장 비싼 유니콘 회사가 Stripe과 ByteDance였는데 가장 고점을 쳤을 때가 아마도 $100 B 정도였던 것 같다. 이 시기에 두 회사가 시장에서 펀드레이징을 돌 때, 회사를 소개해 주는 기존 주주들도 약간 민망해하면서 딜을 공유했던 기억이 난다. 왜냐하면 본인들의 포트폴리오지만, 본인들이 생각해도 말도 안 되게 비싼 것 같고 $100 B이라는 금액 자체가 너무나 큰돈이라서 감이 잘 안 잡혔던 것 같다. 그런데 요새는 상황이 완전히 반대다. $100B은 마치 과거의 $100M 같고 – 실은 $100M도 우리같이 작은 투자자에겐 너무나 큰 돈이다 – 스페이스엑스의 구주를 $1T에 구매하고 싶다는 투자자들도 충분히 있다는 소문은 나에게는 꽤 충격적인 시장의 현실이 아닐 수 없다. 그 누구도 오픈AI와 앤쓰로픽이 $1T이라는 숫자를 이야기할 때 비싸다는 이야기를 안 하고, 그 비싼 가격에 사면 누군가는 더 비싸게 살 사람이 있다는 생각으로만 – 이건 전형적인 바보들의 이론이다 – 이런 비싼 딜을 바라보고 있다. 마치 요샌 그냥 이 정도 가격을 내야 한다는 생각이 기본적으로 깔린 것 같다.\n지금 우리 주위에서 일어나는 이런 현상을 어떻게 설명해야 할까? 절대 금액의 의미 자체가 희석되어 숫자의 인플레이션이 일어나고 있는 것 같다. 숫자의 인플레이션이 아니라면 정말로 이 세상에 몇 년 전 대비 돈이 그렇게 많아졌을까? 종이 상으로는 많아졌을 수도 있지만, 정말로 $100B이라는 돈을 마치 $100M 같이 취급할 정도로? “이걸 더 높은 가격에 사는 다른 바보가 있다면, 현재의 가격이 맞는지는 중요하지 않다” 전략은 거품 시장에서 우리가 과거에도 몇 번 봤던 현상인데, 더 이상 더 높은 가격에 사는 바보들이 없어진다면 – 그리고 생각보다 빨리 없어질 수도 있다 – 이야기의 결말은 해피 엔딩이 아닐 것이다. 특히나 금액이 이렇게 커진 상황에서 시장이 무너지면 정말 전세계적인 재앙이 될 것이다.\n물론, 미국이라는 나라는 한국보다 GDP가 15배나 높은, 비교할 수 없을 정도의 강대국이다. 그래도 미국의 로켓 회사 하나, 그리고 두 개의 AI 회사의 총 기업가치가 전세계에서 13번째로 잘사는 나라인 대한민국 GDP의 거의 두 배라는 건 잘 모르겠다. 내가 걱정하는 이 재앙이 제발 오지 않았으면.",

(PC에서는 QR을 스캔하면 신청 페이지로 이동해요)\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 유서진 Graphic 이은호 이제현",
