This month’s updates includes partial support for Visual Studio 2026 and platform toolset v145, NetBSD platform support, and minor improvements and bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,691 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n38 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n395 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n81 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,100 forks and 26,000 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.10.17 release)\nSupport for v145 platform toolset (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1787, thanks @huangqinjin!).\nAdded support for NetBSD platform (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1789, Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1785, thanks @cqundefine!).\nOther minor improvements and bug fixes.\nDocumentation changes\nOver the past month we had minor documentation improvements.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Another year and another CppCon is all wrapped up! Microsoft was pleased to once again be an exhibitor and to have several of our employees present sessions at the conference. Here are my major takeaways from the keynotes, sessions, conversations, and the general vibe.\nAI tooling is finding a footing with the C++ community. The next year is going to see the reliability and usefulness of those tools jump drastically.\nVisual Studio users consistently name the debugger as one of the best features of the product.\nLots of folks are getting excited about the static reflection capabilities in C++26.\nThe week before CppCon, we announced Visual Studio 2026 and Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50, and the conference gave us a great opportunity to let you know what you can expect in the new release and for you to give us your feedback. We highly encourage you to try out the Insiders release and let us know what your experience is like.\nThis is a long post, so here’s a table of contents to help you navigate if you are only interested in specific parts:\nThe Microsoft Booth\nKeynotes\nMicrosoft Sessions\nOther Sessions of Interest\nWrapping It Up\nNow, let’s get into some of the details from the conference.\nThe Microsoft Booth\n     \n \nConference attendees often describe the “hallway track” as a hidden gem of in-person attendance, and as a tool vendor, the exhibition hall serves a similar function: providing a way to broadly understand what the community and our users are looking for from our products. We really do value your feedback, and we appreciate everyone who came by to talk to us or to fill out our feedback survey. We even managed to get in a couple of deeper, private, in-person conversations with users to really dig into what they want from their tools.\nSurvey\nThe survey we conducted ended up with over 170 unique entries, and from those entries, we randomly selected raffle winners for some great LEGO® prizes. Congratulations to the winner!\n        \n\nKeynotes\nConcept-Based Generic Programming – Bjarne Stroustrup\n\nBjarne’s keynote on generic programming with C++ concepts was focused on showing how concepts, which were added in C++20, are one tool in the toolbox for writing code that can reinforce safety and encapsulate differences between types so that code can be written in a way that it doesn’t have to repeatedly handle all the special cases.\nI was particularly fond of the idea of using values as concept parameters to encode into the type system certain expectations about a type, such as maximum object size, which is important in many serialization, caching, and performance optimization scenarios. It’s a much better solution than my existing preference of using static_assert to check object size directly after the type declaration.\nCrafting The Code You Don’t Write: Sculpting Software in an AI World – Daisy Hollman\n\nI didn’t get a chance to see Daisy’s talk live at the conference, but I caught it on the CppCon Video Archive afterwards. Daisy gives a great talk as usual, balancing sharp technical insight and examples that make them relevant to the viewers’ everyday problems. In this case, it was about understanding LLMs and how they work so that you might understand why they give the sorts of completions that they give based on your prompt. Ultimately, they respond to our prompts and the context we provide, and each model will respond differently.\nOne of my favorite things from the talk was the idea that you should think of LLM-based AI assistants “like junior engineers who have read the whole internet.” This is very similar to my description from my Meeting C++ 2023 talk AI Assistants for C++ Developers “as a very eager, over-confident beginner with access to an enormous library and the skills to quickly find and collate information.” Of course, Daisy puts it much more succinctly.\nReflection: C++’s Decade-Defining Rocket Engine – Herb Sutter\n\nI haven’t gotten around to watching Herb’s talk, but I’m looking forward to it soon. Let us know in the comments what you think about it if you were there or after you’ve watched it on YouTube!\nMore Speed & Simplicity: Practical Data-Oriented Design in C++ – Vittorio Romeo\n\nLike with Herb’s talk, I haven’t gotten a chance to watch Vittorio’s keynote. I’m a pretty big fan of data-oriented design so I’m interested in what Vittorio has to say about it. Let us know what you think of his talk in the comments!\nC++: Some Assembly Required – Matt Godbolt\n\nMatt’s closing keynote session was wide-ranging and quite good, as usual. He walked through the different dictionary definitions of assembly and how they applied to C++ and the C++ community, often in surprisingly meaningful ways. Of course, he’s most well known for Compiler Explorer, which lets you view the generated binary code for your C++ code in a variety of assembly language syntaxes. There was content on technical topics like that, but also some rather inspiring and thoughtful content on softer topics as well. Highly recommended viewing.\nMicrosoft Sessions\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025 – David Li and Augustin Popa\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk, Augustin and David go into a lot more detail of the changes that are coming in the new versions of Visual Studio and the MSVC Build Tools. Here are some of the highlights:\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode is now available in Visual Studio. Agents can better understand intent, plan actions, and carry out tasks with less user guidance. You can provide further context to GitHub Copilot by using a custom instructions file to let it know about the preferred conventions and rules for your repo or organization, like how to add unit tests, what style you prefer for comments, and what your priorities are in terms of the quality of your code.\n\nOne of our biggest features this year is Dynamic Debugging, which allows you to deoptimize code on the fly while debugging, making the debugger more useful for projects that are performance sensitive. You will be able to see all your local variables, step reliably, and step into force inline functions. While this feature was inspired by our game dev partners, it is useful for all C++ applications that use debug and release configurations.\n\nFor the MSVC Build Tools, we continue our progress towards C++23 conformance with support for formatting ranges, std::generator, lambda attributes, and more. We also continued to improve the runtime performance of code built with the latest build tools.\nWe fixed 387 C++ issues and implemented 29 C++ feature requests in the past year.\nThere are many UI improvements in Visual Studio 2026, including 11 colorful themes to choose from, an updated Settings experience, and a dockable all-in-one search window.\nOther productivity improvements include automatic word wrap indentation, enhanced line and column navigation, a better Change Signature experience, and the ability to save files with your preferred encoding format.\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents – Alexandra Kemper\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis session highlighted several important improvements and new features, covering extensions like the C/C++ extension, the CMake Tools extension, and GitHub Copilot extension.\nPerformance is one of the major areas of feedback received for the C/C++ extension, and the latest versions have changes that significantly speed up project startup times and reduce the time for source to be parsed and colorized in the editor. Benchmarks show up to 4x faster colorization for large codebases.\nThe CMake Tools extension now supports version 10 of CMake Presets which adds features like adding comments in the JSON presets files via the “$comment” field and additional support for generating a project dependency graph with Graphviz. By popular demand, the CMake Tools extension now has full language service protocol (LSP) support for CMake, as well as the option to exclude specific CMake folders from the project view for easier code navigation.\nGitHub Copilot support in Visual Studio Code is also improving rapidly, with various AI agents available to users today. Visual Studio Code also has great support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables the creation of tools to perform specific actions and exposes those tools to agents. Beyond the agent improvements, Visual Studio Code has also been making GitHub Copilot completions more context-aware and tailored to common C++ coding patterns, and next edit suggestions (NES) can predict the next expected change based on your previous changes and the coding patterns, making changes that span many lines in your codebase much easier.\nAll features covered in the talk are already publicly available; try them out today and let us know what you think!\n\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugger: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code – Eric Brumer\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nEric’s talk covered the use of C++ Dynamic Debugging to effectively debug your optimized code. You don’t have to worry about any more ‘variable was optimized away’ messages, and taking normal debugger actions like step-over and step-into behaves exactly as you would expect it to. It also covered the underlying technical details which make the feature powerful, easy to use, and fast to build.\nLearn more at https://aka.ms/vcdd and https://aka.ms/dynamicdebugging.\n   \nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]! – Inbal Levi\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThe talk introduces the static reflection feature that was voted into the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) in the C++ standard committee, which reviewed the design of the library side of the reflection feature. The session introduced reflection and its transformative potential within our codebases. After a brief history and introduction of utilities from the latest reflection proposal, Inbal explored the possibilities for “Reflection Libraries” and demonstrated potential directions for future improvements.\n  \nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Ben McMorran\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nBen’s talk was all about why the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is needed to address a variety of problems that AI assistants encounter when they want to evolve beyond a simple chat interface. The MCP solves these problems by providing an open and standard way for tools to provide context and actions to AI agents. For me, the most interesting part of the talk was seeing an MCP agent get implemented and seeing just how simple, yet powerful, they can be. They really form a major backbone of a successful agentic AI system.\n\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI – Ion Todirel\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIon’s talk was about practical advice for using AI tools, specifically for embedded and systems programming tasks. The advice offered was based on real-world problems and attempts to solve them using the AI tools that exist today. I’d say that a lot of the points made are relevant to tasks outside of that domain as well, and a key takeaway I had was that if at first your prompt doesn’t succeed, prompt again. Eventually, with enough experience (and advice) you’ll improve your prompts to get the most effective results and save you time when using an AI assistant.\n    \nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial – Michael Price\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis was my talk and I had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it. I walk through some of the key things that a C++ developer needs to know to get started with game development, focusing on Blender, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio 2026. The key takeaway for this talk is that while getting into game development can be intimidating due to unfamiliar tools and techniques, modern tools really lower the barrier. You can make simple 3D game assets in just a few minutes and easily import them into your project, and making your existing C++ code available to Unreal Engine is actually not that hard.\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop – Victor Ciura\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nHybrid C++/Rust codebases are quickly becoming more common – at Microsoft and everywhere in the industry. Having seamless interop between the C++ and Rust components is essential for the success of this symbiosis. There are many challenges in this process, but people found various ways to make things work – from dealing with ABI compatibility and platform/toolchain guarantees, to going down to C and FFI, to various techniques and tools for generating glue-code between the two languages. Many of the explored solutions so far by the community fail to deliver on all the needed requirements, swinging the wide range between performant and ergonomic. Victor highlighted all the interop challenges, some of the good solutions out there, and teased out the avenues at the forefront of this pursuit.\n\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Bharat Kumar\n\nC++ remains a foundational language for high-performance applications, but its lack of inherent memory safety and prevalence of undefined behaviors pose serious challenges. Rewriting the vast corpus of existing C++ code into a memory-safe language isn’t feasible in the short term, especially for large-scale projects like Microsoft Edge, which is built atop Chromium’s predominantly C++ codebase. Fortunately, meaningful safety improvements are possible without a full rewrite. Chandranath and Bharat explore how the Edge team systematically addresses safety across four core dimensions: bounds checking, lifetime management, initialization correctness, and type safety. These efforts are grounded in real-world engineering constraints and aim to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities while preserving performance. They also delve into complementary initiatives targeting thread safety, definition safety, and the mitigation of other undefined behaviors. By combining targeted refactoring, static analysis, and safer abstractions, the Microsoft Edge team is charting a pragmatic path toward more resilient C++ code. The session offers insights into scalable safety strategies that can be adopted across large legacy codebases.\n    \nBack to Basics: Code Review – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk Chandranath and Kathleen examined examples of common C++ coding mistakes the Microsoft Edge team has come across when reviewing code and shared practical strategies to avoid them. They explored best practices for variable scoping, iteration, function and class design, and useful STL functions and algorithms. The talk also provided clang-tidy checks and warnings to use to catch these common issues.\nC++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects – Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nPrithvi and Kathleen’s session focused on techniques to prevent copying or moving objects in favor of in-place construction. It included many code examples with clang-tidy checks and warnings you can use to point out the potential areas of improvement in your own code. They highlighted guidelines such as passing non-trivial objects by reference, using view types, leveraging in-place constructors, best practices for containers like using emplace and transparent comparators, and finally eliminating runtime cost by moving computation to compile time.\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second – Daniel Lemire (Université du Québec) and Francisco Geiman Thiesen (Microsoft)\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIt is fair to say that reflection was one of the latest additions to the library that has attracted the most attention and it was a subject discussed in many of the talks in this edition of CppCon.\nIn this talk Daniel and Francisco discussed their experience integrating the latest C++26 reflection proposal into the open source simdjson library. A few interesting takeaways from the talk:\nReflection allows the user to deserialize/serialize their types without having to write any boilerplate code; something that previously took a LOT of boilerplate.\nYou can get best-in-class performance by using reflection together with several optimizations, even when extending a library that was designed only with deserialization in mind.\nFor now this is an experimental feature already available in the library. It should gain more traction whenever the latest reflection proposal is added to MSVC, GCC, and\nHandling JSON is a poster-child use case for reflection and they went above and beyond to integrate that into the simdjson library, while still following its design principles and guaranteeing the absolute best performance.\nSlides are publicly available in: C++26 Reflection for JSON Serialization – A Practical Journey\n\nOther Sessions of Interest\nIn addition to the keynotes and our own Microsoft sessions, here are some sessions I managed to catch during my very busy week that I thought were interesting.\nPanel: What We Learned About AI Tools For C++ Engineers – Guy Davidson, Daisy Hollman, Inbal Levi, Jason Turner, Matt Godbolt, Michael Wong\nThe conference hosted a panel on the topic of AI for C++ Engineers, on which senior members of the C++ training, tooling, and authoring community offered their experience of using these tools, how they have improved their workflow, where the shortcomings are, and what the ideal future will hold. They are also keen to hear the experiences of other engineers who have experimented with AI tools.\nCommittee Fireside Chat – Herb Sutter, Jeff Garland, Andrei Alexandrescu, Bjarne Stroustrup, Gabriel Dos Reis, Inbal Levi, Guy Davidson, Timur Doumler, Barry Revzin, Nina Ranns, Khalil Estell, Vittorio Romeo, Ruslan Arutyunyan, Daisy Hollman\nIf you’d like to learn more about C++26’s additions of static reflection, async model (std::execution), contracts, and significant safety improvements, this is the session for you.\nWrapping It Up\nCongrats, you made it to the end! Thanks for reading through all the way. Be sure to come back and check out the Microsoft C++ blog (this one!) over the coming weeks as we make new announcements for Visual Studio 2026 and all of our other C++ products, and we hope to see you all next September in Aurora!\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 getting closer to General Availability (GA), we want to share with you how you can upgrade your projects from your current versions of Visual Studio and the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools to the latest versions. The new IDE ships with the v145 platform toolset for MSBuild C++ projects and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. In this post, I will walk you through the process step-by-step, while explaining some of the features available to you to make the transition as painless as possible. Overall, our goal is to help you get current and stay current.\nStep 1: Try out Visual Studio 2026\nAs of September 9, 2025, you can install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Once the stable release of Visual Studio 2026 ships, you will be able to download it from the same link. You can choose between Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise as before. Visual Studio instances can be installed side-by-side from the Visual Studio Installer application, so you can keep your current version of Visual Studio while exploring 2026.\nIf you are not ready to fully migrate yet, you can load your existing Visual Studio MSBuild (.sln/.vcxproj) projects in Visual Studio 2026 and retain compatibility with your existing copy of Visual Studio without having to upgrade the project files.\nStep 2: Migrate to Visual Studio 2026, stay on existing MSVC Build Tools\nIf you’re satisfied with your Visual Studio 2026 experience and are ready to use it daily, you can do so without needing to use the latest MSVC Build Tools. The installer for Visual Studio 2026 gives you the ability to install your existing C++ build tools going back as far as Visual Studio 2015. You can select multiple components/versions to include for your Visual Studio instance.\n\nHowever, there is an even easier way to get started in Visual Studio 2026 and stay on your existing MSVC toolset version.\nInstall missing tools with Visual Studio setup assistant\nYou can use the new setup assistant experience to install missing tools and/or retarget any projects that are ready to move forward. You do not have to install and upgrade everything all at once.\n\nThis assistant will appear by default when you load your solution for the first time, or you can right-click the solution and select Retarget solution. To stay on a project’s existing toolset version and install any missing tools, choose the “Install missing Platform Toolset…” option. You can also click the Install All button to instantly set all the dropdowns to that option. If you already have the correct toolset version installed and want to stay on it, no action needs to be taken.\nYou will also see options to retarget your projects. You can go back and select these later when you are ready to move your projects and toolset version forward to the latest. Retargeting will update the Windows SDK Version, Platform Toolset, and MSVC Build Tools Version project properties. You may select what to do for each project or retarget all of them at once with the Retarget all button.\nFundamentally, the setup assistant allows you to upgrade gradually at your own pace.\nStep 3: Upgrade MSVC Build Tools to version 14.50\nWhen you decide it’s the right time to upgrade and explore the latest MSVC toolset, the process is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Visual Studio aims to support you to get current and stay current on the latest tools.\nWhy you should upgrade your C++ build tools\nBy upgrading, you get access to new C++ language updates and bug fixes in the Microsoft C++ compiler and standard library. In addition, if you upgrade, you get runtime performance improvements:\nUp to +6%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nRetarget your projects with the setup assistant\nAs mentioned previously, the setup assistant can help you retarget your projects, so they build with the latest MSVC Build Tools.\n\nBelow is a quick video demonstration of the setup assistant in action to install missing tools and retarget projects.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4\n\nThere are the new MSVC components in the Visual Studio Installer.\n\nComponents marked as “Latest” will be updated to the latest available version when you update the IDE, while components with a major and minor version number will remain on that minor version and only receive servicing updates while in support.\nC++ binary compatibility for step-by-step upgrades\nWe’re announcing that MSVC Build Tools version 14.50 preserves binary compatibility with any code built with MSVC tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 or later. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and external dependencies all at once. The Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable, which ships the Visual C++ v14 Runtime, also continues to maintain this binary compatibility. Note: there are a few restrictions with the binary compatibility experience, which you should review in our documentation.\nAs a result of this binary compatibility, you can upgrade your code step-by-step, component by component. You can also update your main application while your external dependencies remain on an older version. For your third party open-source dependencies, you can use the vcpkg package manager to rebuild them with the latest toolset or any previous MSVC toolset shipping in Visual Studio 2026.\nStep 4: Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++\nBut wait, there’s more! GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ helps you migrate your C++ projects to the latest MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, you may need to make additional source code or project system changes due to deprecations or fixes in the newer toolset.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At Meta, we use invisible watermarking for a variety of content provenance use cases on our platforms.\nInvisible watermarking serves a number of use cases, including detecting AI-generated videos, verifying who posted a video first, and identifying the source and tools used to create a video.\nWe’re sharing how we overcame the challenges of scaling invisible watermarking, including how we built a CPU-based solution that offers comparable performance to GPUs, but with better operational efficiency.\nInvisible watermarking is a powerful media-processing technique that allows us to embed a signal into media in a way that’s imperceptible to humans but detectable by software. This technology offers a robust solution for content provenance tagging (an indication of where the content came from), enabling the identification and tracking of content to support various use cases. At its core, invisible watermarking works by subtly modifying pixel values in images, waveforms in audio, or text tokens generated by large language models (LLMs) to embed a small amount of data. The design of watermarking systems adds necessary redundancy; this ensures the embedded identification remains persistent through transcodes and editing, unlike metadata tags that can be lost.\nBringing an invisible watermarking solution to production at scale presents many challenges. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how we overcame challenges with deployment environments, bitrate increases, and visual quality regressions to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nSome Helpful Definitions\nDigital watermarking, steganography, and invisible watermarking are related concepts, but it’s important to understand their differences:\nFeature\nDigital Watermarking\nSteganography\nInvisible Watermarking\n\n\nPurpose\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\nSecret communication\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\n\n\nVisibility\nVisible or invisible\nInvisible\nInvisible\n\n\nRobustness\nagainst content modifications\nMedium to high\nUsually low\nHigh (survives edits)\n\n\nPayload / Message  Capacity\nMedium (varies)\nVaries\nMedium (e.g., >64 bits)\n\n\nComputational Cost\nLow (visible) to high (invisible)\nVaries\nHigh (advanced ML models)\n\n\n\n\nThe Need for Robust Content Tagging\nIn today’s digital landscape, where content is constantly shared, remixed, and even AI-generated, important questions arise:\nWho Published the Video First?\nIn the photos in Figure 1, you can see two different user names, but there’s no visual indicator of who uploaded this image first. Invisible watermarking can help identify the first time a video was uploaded.\nFigure 1: Screenshots of what appear to be the same video uploaded by two users on Instagram Reels.\nIs It Even a Real Image?\nWith increasingly realistic generative AI (GenAI) videos, distinguishing between real and AI-generated content is increasingly challenging. Invisible watermarking can be used to infer if content such as in Figure 2 is AI-generated.\nFigure 2: An AI-generated image.\nWhat Camera Was Used? \nWhen encountering a compelling image or video like the one in Figure 3, people often wonder about the source and tools used for creation. Invisible watermarking can infer this information directly.\nFigure 3: A screenshot from a video captured with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nTraditional methods such as visual watermarks (which can be distracting) or metadata tags (which can be lost if a video is edited or re-encoded) do not address these challenges adequately and robustly. Due to its persistence and imperceptibility, invisible watermarking presents a superior alternative.\nThe Scaling Journey: From GPUs to CPUs\nEarlier digital watermarking research (starting in the 1990s) employed digital signal-processing techniques (such as DCT and DWT) to modify an image’s spectral properties to hide imperceptible information. Although these methods proved highly effective for static images and were considered a “solved problem,” they are not adequately robust against the various types of geometric transformations and filtering we see in social media and other real-world applications. \nToday’s state-of-the-art solutions (such as VideoSeal) use machine-learning (ML) techniques providing significantly improved robustness against the type of edits seen in social media. However, the application of solutions to the video problem domain (i.e., frame-by-frame watermarking) may be prohibitively computationally expensive without the necessary inference optimizations. \nGPUs may seem an obvious solution for deploying ML-based video watermarking solutions. However, most types of GPU hardware are specialized for the training and inference of large-scale models (such as LLMs and diffusion models). They have partial or no support for video transcoding (compression and decompression). Enabling invisible watermarking for videos has therefore posed unique challenges for our existing video-processing software (FFmpeg) and hardware stack (GPUs without video-transcoding capabilities or other custom accelerators for video processing without efficient ML-model inference capabilities). \nGPU Optimization Attempts and the Shift to CPUs\nOur embedding architecture uses FFmpeg with a custom filter to compute and apply invisible watermark masks to the videos. The filter acts as a reusable block that can be added easily to existing video processing pipelines. Migrating to a more optimal inference service for warmed-up models would mean sacrificing the flexibility of our FFmpeg filter, so for our application that was not an option.\nProfiling our invisible watermarking filter revealed low GPU utilization. We implemented frame batching and threading in the filter, but these efforts yielded no significant improvements to latency or utilization. GPUs with hardware video encoders and decoders can more easily reach high throughput, but the GPUs available for our service lack video encoders, requiring frames to be sent back to the CPU for encoding. Here a software video encoder can end up being a major bottleneck for pipelines using low-complexity ML models on a GPU.\nSpecifically, we encountered three primary bottlenecks:\nData transfer overhead: Transferring high-resolution input video frames back and forth between CPUs and multiple GPUs posed challenges to thread and memory optimizations, yielding suboptimal GPU utilization. \nInference latency: Processing multiple invisible watermarking requests across multiple GPUs in parallel on the same host led to a dramatic increase in inference latency.\nModel loading time: Despite the model’s small size, loading the model consumed a significant portion of the total processing time. Relying on FFmpeg prevented us from using warmed-up, pre-loaded models on the GPUs.\nRecognizing these limitations, we began investigating CPU-only inference. The embedder’s neural network architecture is more favorable to GPUs, and initial benchmarks showed that end-to-end (E2E) performance was more than two times slower on CPUs. By adjusting threading parameters for the encoder, decoder, and PyTorch, and optimizing sampling parameters used by the invisible watermarking filter, we saw significant improvements. \nUltimately, with properly tuned threading and embedding parameters, the E2E latency for running invisible watermarking on a CPU in a single process was within 5% of GPU performance. Crucially, we could run multiple FFmpeg processes in parallel on CPUs without increased latency. This breakthrough allowed us to calculate the capacity needed and achieve a more operationally efficient solution compared to a GPU-based solution.\nTo validate our CPU solution’s scalability in a distributed system, we conducted comprehensive load tests. Given a pool of CPU workers, we generated test traffic at increasing request rates to identify the peak performance point before per-request latency began to rise. For comparison, we used the same parameters with GPU inference on a pool of GPU workers with similar capabilities. The results confirmed that our CPU solution could perform at scale, comparable to our local test findings. This achievement allowed us to provision the required capacity with greater operational efficiency compared to a GPU-based approach.\nOptimization Considerations and Trade-offs\nDeploying invisible watermarking at scale presented several optimization challenges, primarily involving trade-offs between four metrics:\nLatency: The speed at which the watermarking process occurs\nWatermark detection bit-accuracy: The accuracy of detecting embedded watermarks\nVisual quality: Ensuring the embedded watermark is imperceptible to the human eye\nCompression efficiency (measured by BD-Rate): Ensuring the embedded watermark does not significantly increase bitrate\nOptimizing for one metric may negatively impact others. For example, a stronger watermark for higher bit accuracy might lead to visible artifacts and increased bitrate. We can’t create a perfectly optimal solution for all four metrics si\nManaging BD-Rate Impact\nInvisible watermarking, while imperceptible, introduces increased entropy, which can lead to a higher bitrate for video encoders. Our initial implementation showed a BD-Rate regression of around 20%, meaning users would need more bandwidth to watch a watermarked video. To mitigate this, we devised a novel frame-selection method for watermarking so that the BD-Rate impact is largely reduced while increasing visual quality and minimally impacting watermark bit detection accuracy.\nAddressing Regressions in Visual Quality \nWe need to ensure the “invisible” watermark remains truly invisible. We initially observed noticeable visual artifacts despite high-quality metric scores (VMAF and SSIM).\nWe addressed the visual-quality evaluations by implementing a custom post-processing technique and iterating through different embedding settings through crowdsourced manual inspections. This subjective evaluation was crucial for unblocking us, as traditional visual quality metrics proved insufficient for detecting the type of artifact an invisible watermark can at times introduce. As we tuned the algorithm for human invisibility, we closely monitored the bit accuracy impact to achieve an optimal balance between visual quality and detection accuracy.\nLearnings and the Road Ahead\nOur journey to deploy a scalable, invisible watermarking solution provided valuable insights:\nWith proper optimizations, CPU-only pipelines can reach performances comparable to GPU pipelines for specific use cases at much lower cost. Contrary to our initial assumptions, with the right optimizations CPUs offered us a more operationally efficient and scalable solution for our invisible-watermarking system. While GPUs are still faster for the invisible watermark model inference, we were able to use optimizations to bring down the overall compute and latency with the CPU fleet.\nTraditional video quality scores are insufficient for invisible watermarking: We learned that metrics like VMAF and SSIM do not fully capture the perceptual quality issues introduced by invisible watermarking, necessitating manual inspection. More research is needed to develop a metric to programmatically detect the visual-quality loss incurred by invisible watermarking.\nThe quality bar for production use is high: Watermarking techniques may not directly apply to real-world use cases due to the impact on BD-Rate and downstream video compression. We needed to expand upon the literature to keep BD-Rate impacts low while maintaining excellent bit accuracy for detection.\nWe successfully shipped a scalable watermarking solution with excellent latency, visual quality, detection bit accuracy, and a minimal BD-Rate impact.\nAs our North Star goal, we aim to continue to improve the precision and copy-detection recall with invisible watermark detection. This will involve further tuning of model parameters, pre- and post-processing steps, and video encoder settings. Ultimately, we envision invisible watermarking as a lightweight “filter block” that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of video use cases without product-specific tweaks, providing minimal impact on the user experience while offering robust content provenance.\nThe post Video Invisible Watermarking at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Modern IDEs are powerful tools with many useful features. When we talk about developer productivity, one thing that comes to mind is mastering the IDE – learning its features, like refactorings, navigation, or code generation, and remembering how to invoke them.\nHowever, discovering all the relevant features of your IDE, and knowing when and how to use them can be challenging. Once you know a given feature exists, there are different ways to invoke it:\n Shortcuts are fast, but it is hard to remember all of them.\n Search Everywhere (⇧⇧) is great, but it pulls you out of your flow.\n Intention actions (Alt+Enter) help, but they are discoverable only when the IDE points them out.\nOur research shows that most developers can only confidently recall a few shortcuts, for example (often three or fewer). The number of useful IDE actions we need is far greater than this. When the right shortcut is hard to find or remember, we rely on menus, hints, and other visual helpers. That’s how IDEs have evolved for years: layering discoverability tools around a keyboard-driven core.\nOne feature every developer does use is code completion. Start typing, and the IDE suggests keywords, variables, or method names. Press the dot button (.) and see relevant API members and templates – it’s so natural that modern development feels impossible without it. Now, we aim to extend this familiar experience beyond code – to the IDE itself. This way, you can discover and execute actions the same way you complete code: context-aware, inline, and without breaking your flow.\n\n\nA brief overview of the command completion feature\n\n\n\nIntroducing command completion (Beta)\nTo help you unlock the full potential of your IDE, we are offering a universal entry point to relevant actions. \nCommand completion is our attempt to provide a new way to access context-aware actions directly from your editor. It extends the existing code completion (accessible via .) that many developers are already using. Command completion works like regular completion, but in addition to classes, methods, and templates, the popup also suggests actions relevant to your current context.\nType . to see code completion, postfix completion, and action suggestions.\nType .. to filter completion suggestions to actions only.\nSelect the action to see the exact context and preview what the action will do if applied.\nTo enable this Beta feature in 2025.2, go to Settings | Editor | General | Code Completion | Command Completion and select Enable command completion.\nEnable Command Completion in settings (IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 Beta)\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with command completion\nCommand completion offers you context-sensitive relevant actions. Depending on where you are in the editor, the list of suggestions may include:\nFixes for issues – quick-fixes and warnings directly from the completion popup.\nCode transformations – actions like Introduce local variable, Reformat code, or Convert to Markdown documentation comment (Java 23+), for example.\nRefactoring and navigation – commonly used actions such as Rename or Go to declaration, as well as context-specific ones like Change signature, may appear when relevant.\nCode generation – options to generate things like constructors or getters/setters, as well as toString() or test methods.\nIn frameworks, IntelliJ IDEA may also suggest relevant actions (e.g. Spring bean wiring). The feature is still evolving, and more framework- and file-type support will be added. Our goal is to provide a seamless typing experience with commands in every environment, even binaries. \nHow does command completion compare to existing features?\nIntelliJ IDEA already has multiple ways to use existing features. Let’s see how command completion compares:\nShortcuts – are great for speed, especially for frequently used actions, but learning shortcuts requires effort. This means there is a steep learning curve, and powerful features often go underused. The pool of meaningful key combinations is limited, and most shortcuts are not intuitive or memorable. Command completion is easier to use, since it does not require you to remember shortcuts; only the action you want to perform.\nIntention actions (Alt+Enter) – IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code and highlights issues or improvements. Intention actions provide quick-fixes, but excessive highlighting can sometimes be distracting. Quick-fixes are reactive and limited to detected issues. Intention actions offer only a limited set of actions. Command completion offers you all the actions that are relevant to your current context. The list of actions is searchable, so you can find what you need.\nPostfix completion – Built-in templates let you quickly transform an existing expression with a single, meaningful suffix. For example,  .var transforms an existing expression into a properly declared variable, allowing you to keep moving forward when writing code. They require you to know about them, to know a template exists, or to be able to quickly find it. Command completion extends this idea to all actions, without requiring you to know the exact names of templates or commands.\nSearch Everywhere (⇧⇧) – This feature allows you to find anything inside IntelliJ IDEA. However, it requires multiple steps to perform an actual action: You have to open the dialog, type the name of the desired action (which requires you to know the name), navigate the results, and confirm the action; all of which pull you out of your coding flow. More importantly, it’s detached from the current code context. Command completion keeps you in the editor, in your current context, offering only actions that are relevant there.\nCode completion – In IntelliJ IDEA, code completion will automatically appear where relevant. It can also be explicitly invoked by typing a dot (.) or the shortcut (⌃␣ on macOS) / Ctrl+Space on Windows/Linux). In addition to classes, methods, and templates, command completion adds a list of context-relevant actions. You will find them in the list of regular completion. You can filter this list to commands only, using double dot (..). You can also type ”..” anywhere in your editor to see which commands are available in that context.\nCommand completion is a new and complementary way to work with IntelliJ IDEA, not a replacement for existing features. It combines the speed of shortcuts with the discoverability of Search Everywhere, in an easily accessible, context-aware experience. It helps you discover relevant, powerful features, in the context where you are working. We hope it feels like a natural extension of your existing workflow and helps you to be more productive.\nIn short: Command completion doesn’t replace existing features – it extends and complements them. \nWhy this matters\nIntelliJ IDEA is designed to keep you in the coding flow. Command completion helps with this by offering the following benefits:\nContext-awareness: Suggestions adapt to where you are in your code.\nCollaboration: Easier for experienced users to guide newcomers – just type “.change signature” – no shortcut knowledge required.\nConsistency: Works across different keymaps, OSes, and workflows.\nDiscoverability: See what actions are possible without leaving the editor.\nCommand completion allows you to think about what you want to achieve, instead of how to do so. This will also make pair programming easier, as you only need to describe what you want to do without having to interrupt your flow to find how to do it.  \nLooking ahead\nCommand completion is still in Beta, with improvements ongoing. At the moment, we have support for Java and Kotlin, as well as a few framework-specific actions that are also provided as intention actions, like Autowire Bean when you are using Spring Framework, or Extract JPQL Query for a Spring Data repository. More actions, file types, and framework-specific commands will appear in future releases, not only for Spring, but also for Hibernate and other frameworks. \nFor example, in the 2025.3 EAP, you can already navigate read-only files with .., Go to Declaration, or Go to Implementation – even in external libraries. Also in 2025.3 EAP, commands come with aliases, so you don’t have to remember the exact names. We are also planning to add the option to add your own actions to command completion. Finally, we’re exploring integration with AI, so you could type things like “.suggest better name” or “.explain this”.\nInitial feedback\nWe very much appreciate your feedback and will be using it to guide the development process. So far, our first Beta users have indicated that the feature is promising. \nA lot of comments were provided under the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream where the command completion (Beta) feature was introduced:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also received some direct feedback on LinkedIn and other Social Media: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out: Go to Settings, enable Command Completion, type . in the editor, and explore. You might discover powerful IDE features you never knew were there!\nPlease let us know what you think. We would love to hear how you are using command completion in your daily work and what we could add to make it even better. Thank you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the most recent JetBrains.NET Days Online 2025 event, Maarten Balliauw delivered a comprehensive session on migrating existing codebases to use C# nullable reference types, a feature that’s been available since C# 8 but remains underutilized in many legacy projects. Through practical examples and migration strategies, Maarten demonstrated how to bring null safety to your existing code without drowning in thousands of warnings.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\n#nullable enable – Unlock the Power of C# Nullability — Maarten Balliauw\nIt’s not for runtime safety\nMaarten opens with a crucial clarification that sets realistic expectations for the entire migration journey: “There is no runtime safety for nullable reference types. It is design time and compile time that help to check whether something can be null or not.” This isn’t a silver bullet that will eliminate all null reference exceptions – it’s a tool to help developers make better decisions while writing code.\nThe feature essentially flips the traditional C# paradigm. As Maarten explains, “The idea is that when you’re writing code, every single type that you have is going to be non-nullable by default. And there is a syntax to annotate a reference type as being nullable.” This inversion makes nullability explicit rather than implicit, forcing developers to think intentionally about null handling.\nThe Boy Scout Rule for migration\nWhen it comes to migrating existing codebases, Maarten advocates for a pragmatic approach. For smaller projects, you might enable nullability project-wide and plow through the warnings. But for larger codebases, he recommends the Boy Scout Rule: \n“Keep it disabled at the project level. And whenever you touch a piece of code, you enable it file by file and just work your way through until the entire project is converted.”\nThe key insight for where to begin? “Start at the center and work outwards” (29:59). Maarten suggests starting with classes that have few dependencies but are used extensively throughout the codebase, typically data transfer objects and domain models. A small change in these central classes can eliminate warnings across your entire codebase.\nThe temptation of the dammit operator\nThroughout the presentation, Maarten repeatedly warns against one particular anti-pattern: the null-forgiving operator (!), also known as the “dammit operator”. His stance is unequivocal: “The null forgiving operator is an anti-pattern.”\nWhy such strong language? “You’re lying to the compiler. You’re lying to yourself when you are working in this codebase a couple of months after you first wrote the code.” While the operator can be useful during migration to temporarily suppress warnings, Maarten emphasizes that production code should never ship with these suppressions.\nEmbracing null, not fighting it\nIn a refreshing perspective shift, Maarten reminds developers: “Don’t be afraid of null. Nullable reference types will help you get more confidence in compiler and IDE flow analysis. It’s impossible to get rid of all of the null usages in code” (37:23). The goal isn’t to eliminate null entirely, it’s to build a safety net for dealing with it effectively.\nThis philosophy extends to library authors, who need to consider consumers using different languages. Since nullable reference types are C# only, libraries should still include runtime null checks for robustness, especially when the API might be consumed by F# or VB.NET code that won’t benefit from the nullable annotations.\nEntity Framework’s surprise\nOne of the most valuable warnings in the presentation concerns Entity Framework Core, which has a potentially breaking behavior: “The Entity Framework Core team, unfortunately, did look at this, and they are actually updating your database schema based on nullable reference types.”\nThis means that enabling nullable reference types can inadvertently trigger database schema changes, something that might slip past developers but certainly won’t escape the notice of your DBA. It’s a “gotcha” that Maarten admits makes sense from Entity Framework’s perspective, but one that can be an unwelcome surprise during migration.\nPractical tools for the journey\nMaarten highlights several tools that make migration more manageable (38:28). The value tracking feature in Microsoft Visual Studio and Rider helps trace where properties are set, making it easier to determine if something can actually be null. The automatic migration tools can get you quite far along the way by running flow analysis and making educated guesses about nullability.\nFor JSON serialization scenarios, Maarten presents multiple strategies, with his personal favorite being the use of the required keyword combined with proper validation, rather than littering code with null-forgiving operators or losing type safety by making everything nullable.\nThe takeaway\nMaarten’s session demystifies the migration to nullable reference types, presenting it not as an all-or-nothing proposition but as a gradual improvement process. His closing summary captures the essence perfectly: “Nullable reference types give you design time and compile time safety in .NET, not at runtime.”\nThis session serves as both a technical guide and a philosophical framework for approaching nullability. It’s not about achieving perfection or eliminating all nulls – it’s about making your codebase more predictable, maintainable, and explicit about its null-handling intentions.\nFor teams sitting on legacy codebases wondering if the migration effort is worth it, the essence of Maarten’s argument is that the investment in nullable reference types pays dividends in code clarity, reduced bugs, and better communication of intent between team members, including your future self.\nFollow Maarten Balliauw’s work on nullable reference types and other C# topics on his blog, X, and Bluesky.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI Qith Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nThe Null-Forgiving Operator in C# Is a Code Smell(!)  by Matthew Champion.\nNullable reference types in C# – Migrating to nullable reference types by Maarten Balliauw. \nNullable reference types and nullability in EF Core by Damir Arh.\nNull & Void – Everything About Nothing in .NET – a presentation given by Stefan Pölz at .NET Days Online 2021.",

Recently, you’ve shared important feedback about AI usage limits, transparency, and the freedom to choose which AI providers you use. We heard you loud and clear.\nThat’s why we are working to introduce bring-your-own-key (BYOK) support for JetBrains AI Assistant and Junie. Simply put, BYOK will allow you to connect your personal accounts from OpenAI (or any compatible API) and Anthropic so you can use them directly in your JetBrains IDE. This feature will later be extended to work with Google Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and even self-hosted local models, and you will even be able to use it without a JetBrains AI subscription.\nWhy BYOK?\nWe understand that quotas can feel restrictive, and unclear usage policies can lead to frustration. With the BYOK feature, you will no longer be limited to JetBrains-managed quotas. Instead, you will use your own existing AI provider accounts, gaining clear visibility into your usage and costs directly from your provider.\nWhat will this mean for you?\nFreedom of choice: Pick your preferred AI model or provider. Whether it’s the latest cutting-edge model from Anthropic or Google, or a cost-efficient local model hosted on your own servers, you will decide what best suits your workflow.\n\n\n\n\nFull transparency: Clearly see how much each AI interaction costs in real time on your selected platform, without worrying about hidden quotas or unexpected interruptions.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and security: Your API keys will remain securely stored and managed on your own machine and will never be shared with JetBrains. Your data will stay between you and your chosen AI provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an open ecosystem\nWith planned support for industry standards like the OpenAI API, ACP (Agent Client Protocol), Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol, and other common interfaces, JetBrains is committed to creating an open ecosystem. This approach means your IDE will become a hub that’s open to all current – and future – AI providers, without forcing vendor lock-in.\nWhat’s next?\nWe expect to add this feature by the end of the year, and this is just the beginning of our journey. We’re currently also working on expanding the range of supported AI providers, simplifying configurations, and refining features based on your feedback.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and learn which features you’d like us to prioritize next.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we approach the release of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we would like to share key information about changes that may impact your plugin development process. This post addresses common questions from the developer community and provides guidance on maintaining compatibility with the latest IntelliJ Platform versions.\nNo Immediate Upgrade Required\nIf you built your plugin against the IntelliJ Platform 2025.2 or earlier, it should remain compatible with 2025.3. You don’t need to rush to update right away.\nTip: Check compatibility locally by running the verifyPlugin Gradle task. This performs the same IntelliJ Plugin Verifier checks that are automatically run on JetBrains Marketplace when you upload plugin updates.\nThe IntelliJ Platform maintains strong backward compatibility, which generally preserves between minor versions. It means you can take your time testing and migrating your plugins.\nMajor Change: Unified Platform Distribution\nWhat’s Changing?\nStarting with version 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA Community and Ultimate will be delivered as a unified platform. This marks a significant architectural change that makes plugin development and distribution easier. Read the full announcement: IntelliJ IDEA Moves to the Unified Distribution.\nStarting with 2025.1, PyCharm has undergone the same unification. Learn more in the PyCharm Unified blog post.\nNote: These updates only affect plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later. If your plugin still uses the IntelliJ Platform in version 2025.2 or earlier, no changes are needed at this time. References to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Community for older versions continue working.\nKey Implications for Plugin Developers\nWith the unified distribution:\nIntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (IC) builds for 2025.3 and later are no longer available. Trying to resolve artifacts using IC-2025.3, IC-253.x.y, or the intellijIdeaCommunity() dependency helper will cause an error.\nFor version 2025.3 and future versions, you must target intellijIdea() as a platform artifact.\nWhen targeting PyCharm 2025.1 and above, use ⁠pycharm(version) instead of ⁠pycharmCommunity(version) and ⁠pycharmProfessional(version).\nThe unified distribution retains the same IU product code as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nThe difference between Community and Ultimate now depends on licensing and feature access, not separate IDE distributions. All IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate plugins are included in the distribution but are disabled if there is no active subscription.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) is available in a unified distribution and does not require a subscription.\nDepending on Paid Functionality\nIf your plugin requires subscription-based features, you can explicitly depend on com.intellij.modules.ultimate. This module represents the licensing mechanism; when a user doesn’t have an active subscription, this module and all plugins that depend on it are disabled.\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.ultimate</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nWhat Does This Mean for Your Users?\nUsers upgrading from IntelliJ IDEA Community 2025.2  will be smoothly transitioned to the unified IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 as part of a regular version update. All plugins will continue working. \nThe free tier now offers additional features:\nBasic database functions (schema viewing, SQL completion).\nProject wizards for Spring Boot, Ktor, and other frameworks.\nBasic syntax highlighting for frameworks.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration (previously only available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate).\nRequirements\nTo work with version 2025.3, update the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\nplugins {\n  id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nWhen targeting 2025.3 for development, you must use the new ⁠intellijIdea() dependency helper—whether your plugin targets IntelliJ IDEA specifically or all other IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform.\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        // or intellijIdeaUltimate(\"2025.2\")\n\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\nWhen targeting PyCharm specifically, use the pycharm() dependency:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharmCommunity(\"2024.3\")\n        // or pycharmProfessional(\"2024.3\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharm(\"2025.3\")\n    }\n}\nSee the Step-by-Step Migration Guide below for detailed instructions on updating your plugin.\nOpen Source and Custom IDEs\nFor developers building custom IDEs or using the open source version:\nThe open source code remains available on GitHub at JetBrains/intellij-community.\nGitHub Actions are now provided to simplify the process of building the IDE from source.\nPre-built open source versions can be found on GitHub Releases.\nThe open-source build utilizes the Community Edition (IC) product code and is compatible with all plugins that work with the Community Edition.\nCustom IDEs, like Android Studio, continue to function as before.\nKey API Changes in 2025.3\nModule Extraction and Explicit Dependencies\nSeveral modules have been separated from the core plugin into their own modules, each with its own individual classloader. While this does not affect binary compatibility, it is advisable to explicitly depend on the modules you need using bundledModule(moduleName):\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth.base\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.backend\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.protocolReaderRuntime\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.ui\nintellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\nintellij.platform.vcs.log\nintellij.platform.vcs.log.graph\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.log\")\n    }\n}\nIntelliLang Plugin Dependency Change\nIf your plugin relies on the org.intellij.intelliLang plugin, declare a dependency on the bundled module intellij.platform.langInjection:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"org.intellij.intelliLang\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.langInjection\")\n    }\n}\nStorage Annotation Restriction\nThe @Storage annotation can no longer be used at the top level. It must only be used within @State.storages.\n@Service\n@State(name = \"MySettings\", storages = [Storage(\"MySettings.xml\")])\nclass MySettings : PersistentStateComponent<MySettings> {\n\n  var myProperty = false\n\n  override fun getState() = this\n\n  override fun loadState(state: MySettings) = XmlSerializerUtil.copyBean(state, this)\n\n  companion object {\n    fun getInstance(): MySettings = service()\n  }\n}\nWhy Explicit Dependencies Matter\nDeclaring explicit dependencies on the plugins and modules your plugin uses is a best practice. It makes your plugin’s requirements clear to both the platform and other developers, ensures proper dependency loading order, and helps JetBrains Marketplace determine product compatibility.\nUnderstanding Dependencies: Gradle Build Script vs plugin.xml\nDependencies on plugins and modules defined in your Gradle build script, using the plugin(), bundledPlugin(), and bundledModule() dependency helpers, interact with the compilation classpath to ensure they are available during plugin development. However, to make them available at runtime for your plugin, it’s also required to define them in your plugin.xml file. See the Plugin Dependencies documentation for details.\nExample with plugin dependencies\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.java</depends>\n    <depends>org.intellij.scala</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nExample with plugin and bundled module dependencies\nIf your plugin depends on bundled modules, you must use the plugin model v2 dependencies definition, which requires the <dependencies> block with a clear separation between plugin and module dependencies.\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <dependencies>\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.modules.platform\" />\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.java\" />\n        <plugin id=\"org.intellij.scala\" />\n        <module name=\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\" />\n    </dependencies>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nThis ensures that your plugin can compile with these dependencies during development and access them at runtime when users install it.\nStep-by-Step Migration Guide\nUpdate Your Gradle Plugin Version\nUpdate the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version, currently 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\n[org.jetbrains.intellij.platform] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is outdated: 2.10.0. Update `org.jetbrains.intellij.platform` to: 2.10.4\nTo update your setup to the latest version, simply increase the plugin version in the build.gradle.kts file or the ./gradle/libs.versions.toml if applicable.\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nTesting Against 2025.3 Before Official Release\nEven if your plugin is designed for older versions of the IntelliJ Platform, it can still be used in future releases. To ensure compatibility with newer IDEs than the SDK you use, utilize the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier tool to check binary compatibility against other IntelliJ Platform versions.\nIn build.gradle.kts specify:\nintellijPlatform {\n   pluginVerification {\n        ides {\n            recommended()\n        }\n    }\n}\nNext, run the verifyPlugin Gradle task to perform the verification and identify any potential issues that require attention.\nIt is also possible to manually run a specific IDE with a different version than the one set for development, with your plugin loaded. To do this, register a new runEap Gradle task and execute it immediately afterward.\nval runEap by intellijPlatformTesting.runIde.registering {\n    type = IntelliJPlatformType.IntellijIdea\n    version = \"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\"\n    useInstaller = false\n}\nSwitching to 2025.3 for development\nImportant: The installer for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 will only be available once 2025.3 is officially released. Until then, if you want to test your plugin against 2025.3 early, you have two options:\nUse a specific EAP release\nAll published JetBrains IDEs available for download are ready for use by all users and should also be used for plugin development to reflect our customers’ needs. To do this, you can simply add the IntelliJ Platform dependency using intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). However, if such a version is not yet available, you can refer to early access releases, which include their build numbers, available on the IntelliJ IDEA EAP download page or in a machine-readable JSON feed.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253.27864.23\")\n    }\n}\nUse snapshot versions\nJetBrains IDEs are also released as snapshots in the IntelliJ Platform Artifacts Repositories. To switch to these intermediate releases, you need to opt out of the installer artifacts and use a version specific to the IntelliJ Snapshots Maven Repository.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\") {\n            useInstaller = false\n        }\n    }\n}\nOnce 2025.3 is officially released, simply use intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). For more details, see the Target Versions documentation.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I need to update my plugin immediately when 2025.3 is released?\nNo, plugins built for 2025.2 or older versions should still work with 2025.3.\nWhat if my plugin only supports versions earlier than 2025.3?\nNo changes needed. The older syntax (intellijIdeaCommunity(version), intellijIdeaUltimate(version), pycharmCommunity(version), and pycharmProfessional(version)) still works for older versions.\nWill my plugin work with both free-tier and paid subscription users?\nYes, using the intellijIdea(\"2025.3\") makes your plugin work for all users regardless of subscription status.\nDo I need to build multiple versions of my plugin for 2025.2 and 2025.3?\nNo. The platform type you specify in your build script is only used during plugin development. Your plugin.xml file contains the actual compatibility information through <depends> declarations and the since-build attribute. A single plugin build can work across multiple IDE versions.\nGradle fails with “Could not find idea:ideaIC:253.x.x”. What should I do?\nThis occurs because Community Edition builds are not available for versions 2025.3 and later. You have two options:\nUse an older version of IntelliJ IDEA Community for building, which will still make your plugin compatible with 2025.3.\nUpgrade the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to 2.10.4 and switch to intellijIdea(version).\nIf 2025.3 has not been released yet, you can use EAP by specifying a build number as the version.\nSet the version to 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT and set useInstaller = false.\nHow do I know which modules to include explicitly in dependencies?\nThe IntelliJ Plugin Verifier will report missing dependencies. Refer to the Key API Changes in 2025.3 section above.\nHow can I test against 2025.3 before the official release?\nUse specific EAP build numbers or snapshot versions, such as 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT, with useInstaller set to false. See Testing Against 2025.3 Before Official Release above.\nWhat versioning scheme should I use if I need separate builds for different versions?\nUse a SemVer-compatible scheme with suffixes, such as 1.2.3-251 for the 2025.1 version and 1.2.3-253 for the 2025.3 version. JetBrains Marketplace will automatically serve the correct version based on the user’s IDE version and your since-build and until-build attributes.\nConclusion\nThe IntelliJ Platform 2025.3 release introduces a unified IntelliJ IDEA distribution while maintaining strong backward compatibility. Plugins built for earlier IntelliJ Platform versions will still work with 2025.3, giving you time to migrate at your own pace.\nWhen you’re ready to target 2025.3, update to IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.10.4 or later and switch to the new intellijIdea() dependency helper. The platform APIs stay consistent across all license types, ensuring that your plugin works the same way for all users. Declare explicit dependencies on the modules you need, and use the verifyPlugin task to test compatibility before publishing.\nGot questions? Contact us on the JetBrains Platform Forum.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Every developer recognises the trade-off. You can take the shortcut that delivers today but breaks tomorrow, or choose the slower approach that earns lasting confidence.\nThis dilemma has become even more poignant with the widespread integration of AI agents into real workflows. Speed feels tempting, but speed without trust usually wastes more time than it saves.\nThe essential question is not how fast agents can act, but how trustworthy they are when they act. Productivity grows when trust and speed work in unison – with trust being the crucial starting point.\nHow AI agents take us further than automation\nAI agents are software collaborators that transform goals into actions. They extend beyond simple automation because they make decisions: when to act, when to ask for feedback, and which tools to use. Unlike scripts that only execute predefined steps, agents respond to context and adjust as they go.\nA single agent can be useful, but multi-agent systems push the idea further. Rather than one agent trying to cover every step, multiple agents can specialize, share context, and divide tasks. This creates collaboration that feels more like a team at work – reducing friction, adding resilience, and accelerating progress.\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows and orchestration are essential to effective collaboration. Agents need a way to coordinate, hand off tasks, and adapt their actions in real time. With the right structure, multiagents can move beyond isolated contributions and operate as a coherent system, unlocking the full potential of agentic workflows.\nEarly use cases: Promising but with practical limits\nAgents already show value in routine development tasks, outperforming humans in many basic use cases. They can surface relevant classes in a large codebase, identify inefficient patterns and propose refactoring, or manage project operations such as running tests and summarising documentation.\nAll these capabilities can ease cognitive load and free time for higher-level design, but this added value comes with risk: Agents may hallucinate, introduce insecure code, or miss compliance requirements.\nLike junior collaborators, they’re helpful only with review and strong guardrails. With this said, can developers trust them enough to handle more critical work?\nAgents as junior collaborators\nWhen a junior collaborator joins a development team, they arrive eager and capable, but their contributions require supervision. Over time, with the right tools – such as a reliable IDE, debugging support, version control, and testing frameworks – they learn to deliver results that the team can trust.\nAgents follow the same path. They handle repetition easily, but without a strong infrastructure, capable tools, and clearly defined workflows, their work risks introducing errors or compliance breaches.\nJetBrains has always helped developers grow through dependable tools. We are extending that foundation to agents, giving them the support they need to transition from promising assistants to trustworthy collaborators.\nWhy trust matters more than speed\nTrust is not optional, and research supports this idea. A fin.ai study of customer service interactions showed that slower responses often felt more intelligent to users because they suggested greater effort.\nThis effect, called the “labor illusion”, demonstrates why speed alone does not create confidence. In software development, fast but shallow results typically need significant reworking and often provoke frustration.\nComplex tasks require deeper reasoning, which naturally takes more time. Developers understand that correctness is more valuable than immediacy. \nThis is why our AI Agents Research team created EnvBench and GitGoodBench to evaluate AI agents on software engineering tasks in Python, Java, Kotlin, and bash. By focusing on realistic workflows, these benchmarks reveal where current approaches fall short and where improvements are most needed to support developers. \nThis way, agents can first be made reliable and trustworthy. Only then does optimizing for speed translate to genuine progress as opposed to greater risk.\nBuild agents you can trust\nMany talk about the promise of agents, but little is said about their tangible benefits. Here at JetBrains, we are not just about following the latest trends; we want to build long-term trust. \n“Our philosophy is not just to build AI for the sake of building AI; we are not hype chasers. We have always been a private company, so we really depend on bringing true value to our developers”, says CEO Kirill Skrygan.\nAnd we’re applying this philosophy with Koog, our agentic framework for building AI agents in Kotlin. Koog provides the structure, memory, and orchestration that agents need to act reliably and ensure alignment with developer expectations. It manages workflows, tools, and context, enabling agents to integrate smoothly into projects and become dependable collaborators.\nPaired with the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, Koog extends beyond individual workflows. A2A standardizes communication, enabling agents to discover each other, exchange tasks, and collaborate across systems without custom integrations. Together, Koog and A2A make it possible to scale multi-agent systems that are both trustworthy and efficient. \nJetBrains is developing solutions that give agents a solid foundation, helping developers build greater trust in them. Enterprises are also a key focus for JetBrains, and we’ll explore that in the next article in this series.",

Vote for the features you’d like to see migrated\nWhy this change matters\nIntegrating Grazie natively allows us to:\nDeliver proofreading and writing assistance consistently across all JetBrains IDEs.\nShip improvements alongside IDE updates.\nReduce compatibility issues and plugin maintenance overhead.\nOur goal is to make natural language a first-class citizen in JetBrains IDEs, supporting not just correct English or German but also effective communication between developers and AI tools.\nWhat’s new in the built-in grammar and style checks\nThe built-in Natural Languages plugin combines Grazie’s proven proofreading with an extended set of capabilities:\nWriting domains – tailor the checks for different contexts like commit messages, prompting with AI, code comments, technical documentation, UI text, or general prose.\nGranular tone and style settings – adjust formality, clarity, and tone directly in your IDE.\nSmarter performance and detection – faster, lighter, and more consistent across editors.\nYou can use local proofreading out of the box, or switch to JetBrains AI Assistant for advanced cloud-based grammar and style checks, plus AI-powered rewrite, completion, and translation actions.\nSome cloud functionality – like Rephrase and more advanced proofreading – will also be available even without AI Assistant.\nNote: Accepting cloud-based grammar and style suggestions does not consume your AI quota.\nOther AI-powered actions, such as Rephrase or Translate, do use your AI quota, but typically at a much lower rate than code generation or refactoring. For approximate quota spending by different AI actions, see the AI Assistant usage guide.\n? Grazie – and grazie!\nBecause in any language, saying “thank you” never goes out of style.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains .NET Days Online 2025, Jason Taylor, Microsoft MVP and Solutions Architect at Particular Software, delivered an engaging presentation that transforms how we think about building distributed systems. Through live coding and interactive polls with the audience, Taylor demonstrated how .NET Aspire can turn what’s traditionally been a complex, friction-filled process into something surprisingly manageable.\nWhether you’re building your first distributed system or looking to modernize an existing one, Jason Taylor’s presentation offers both practical techniques and a refreshing perspective on how development tools should work. In short, they should make the complex feel effortless.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\nEffortless Distributed Systems With .NET Aspire – Jason Taylor, October 2025.\nThe philosophy of “effortless”\nJason Taylor opens with a crucial distinction that sets the tone for the entire presentation: \n“Effortless doesn’t mean no effort. It means reducing friction and spending effort in the right places.” \n(02:03)\nThis philosophy underpins everything that follows. .NET Aspire isn’t about eliminating work, but about eliminating the wrong kind of work.\nThe goal, as the speaker explains, is straightforward: “Shifting the focus back to what matters, right? Delivering features that users care about. We want to reduce wasted effort by eliminating manual setup, wiring, and boilerplate.”\nFrom zero to orchestrated in minutes\nStarting with a basic ASP.NET Core application that’s intentionally unreliable, Jason shows how adding .NET Aspire immediately transforms the development experience. With just a few clicks, the application gains automatic retry policies, service discovery, health checks, and comprehensive telemetry.\nThe transformation is dramatic: “When we added orchestration support to our application, we got lots of things for free. And one of those was HTTP client resilience, and it was using Polly to retry that request whenever it failed.” (10:16) No configuration files, no manual wiring – just instant resilience.\nThe developer experience revolution\nPerhaps the most compelling aspect of Jason’s demonstration is how Aspire transforms the local development experience. “The best part of course is our local development experience couldn’t be simpler or better. One press of F5 launches the entire system ready to test and observe instantly. (42:07)” \nBut this feature isn’t just about convenience for experienced developers, as Jason also emphasizes its utility when it comes to team onboarding: “That’s an excellent experience for a new developer who joins your team and is trying to get up and running. They press F5, then they start learning about the system.” Gone are the days of lengthy setup documentation and “but it works on my machine” problems.\nLive database migration without the pain\nIn one of the presentation’s interactive moments, Jason lets the audience vote on which database to use, and PostgreSQL wins over Azure SQL (14:27 ). What follows is a masterclass in how Aspire handles infrastructure changes. Within minutes, he swaps out SQLite for PostgreSQL, complete with Docker containerization, migrations, and service discovery.\nThe key insight: “No more juggling startup projects. With service defaults, we instantly get service discovery, health checks, resilience, and telemetry, all without manual setup.”\nMessaging made simple\nJason then tackles one of distributed systems’ thorniest challenges – reliable messaging (22:45). Using NServiceBus (from his employer, Particular Software), he demonstrates how Aspire’s abstraction model makes switching between message transports effortless. The audience votes for RabbitMQ over Azure Service Bus, and Jason seamlessly makes the switch with minimal code changes, all while maintaining the same local development experience.\nFrom local to cloud without the usual headaches\nThe presentation’s climax comes when Jason deploys the entire system to Azure (42:39). Using the Azure Developer CLI (azd) with Aspire’s deployment manifest, he sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps (another audience choice) in under five minutes.\n“With Aspire, our C# app model became the source of truth. We didn’t write any Bicep, ARM, or Terraform code. The deployment manifest describes our entire system and feeds directly into tools like AZD.” The entire infrastructure, including databases, message queues, and observability tools, is derived from the C# code that defines the application.\nThe bottom line\nJason Taylor’s closing advice distills the entire presentation into actionable wisdom: \n“Choose the right tools, remove the friction, and focus on what truly matters, delivering features that make an impact.”\nFollow Jason Taylor on X or visit his blog for more content on .NET, Azure, and distributed systems.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI With Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nComposing Distributed Applications With .NET Aspire – a presentation from .NET Days 2024 by Cecil Phillip that demonstrates .NET Aspire’s approach to building distributed apps.\n.NET Aspire and Dev Container – an article by Laurent Kempé showing how to work with .NET Aspire 9.1 inside a Dev Container using JetBrains Rider.\nSimplify Your .NET Development With Aspire – a step-by-step guide by Microsoft MVP Joseph Guadagno on adding .NET Aspire to an existing .NET 9 web app, including specific instructions for JetBrains Rider.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The October 2025 update for Visual Studio 2022 (v17.14) is now available. In this month, we are bringing you improvements to model choices and agentic flows. \n\nNew Models \nWe now have Claude Sonnet 4.5  and Claude Haiku 4.5 available in the chat window. This means the latest innovations for driving your agentic workflows is right at your fingertips. \nMemories \n\nFor Copilot to work effectively for your unique team and repository, it needs to learn about your project and team best practices. Copilot memories enable Copilot to understand and apply your project’s specific coding standards, making it project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nHow Copilot memories work \nMemories use intelligent detection to understand your team’s preferences as you prompt in the chat. That means, as you prompt how you normally would, Copilot is looking for instances where you correct its behavior, explicitly indicate a standard, or ask it to remember something. When detected, you’ll see a confirmation nudge to save the preference. Copilot will then categorize the preference into one of three files: \n.editorconfig for coding standards \nCONTRIBUTING.md for best practices, guidelines, architectural standards, etc. \nand README.md for high level project information \nSo, as you prompt, you’re not only teaching Copilot how to respond better to you in the future, but you’re also helping out your team by documenting your development best practices, and augmenting their future Copilot responses as well! \nPlanning \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\n\nCopilot Chat now includes built-in planning to help guide large, multi-step tasks.  \nWhen you ask a complex question, Copilot automatically creates a markdown plan file with: \nA task list  \nThe files it plans to edit  \nContext for its approach \nAs it works, Copilot updates the plan in real time – tracking progress, adapting to blockers, and keeping its logic transparent. \nPlanning is fully visible, scoped to your goal, and implemented through tool calling, making behavior more predictable, reliable, and easy to follow. \nTry it out: Ask Copilot to refactor a component, add a new feature, or fix bugs across multiple files. \n Plan files are temporary by default. To reuse or share them across threads, save the file into your repo. \nTo learn more about planning or share your feedback, check out the blog post. \nInstruction Files \n\nGetting Copilot to respond the way you want can be a challenge. You may have different coding standards, best practices, or architectural patterns in different areas of your codebase. With instruction files, you can now target specific instructions to specific folders or files in your repository, making Copilot truly project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nEnable the feature \nTurn on the feature at Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat > Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files and added to requests. \nWrite instruction files \nFormat your instructions with the applyTo header and specify a glob pattern for which files you want these instructions to be included for. \n--- \n \napplyTo: \"src/**/*.cs\" \n \n---\nIn the file body, you can use natural language to specify your content and reference other instruction files to compose instructions together.  \nSave the file with the .instructions.md file extension in the root of your repository in the .github/instructions folder. \nTip: You can even get Copilot’s help refining your instructions to be more detailed. \nHow it works \nWhen you prompt Copilot, it will automatically detect which instruction files apply to the files in your current context and attach them as references. You can see which instructions were attached by clicking on the references in the response card. \nBring Your Own Model with Azure Foundry\nWant the ultimate layer of control over which models you’re using in GitHub Copilot Chat? Try out the new Azure Foundry integration to bring your own models.\nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything in Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions. \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Visual Studio October Update – new models, memories, planning, and more appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

USB 색깔 규격이 모든 브랜드나 모든 기기에 걸쳐 아주 엄격하게 표준화되어 있는 것은 아니라는 사실이죠. 이론적으로는 어떤 제조업체가 USB 1.1 포트에 파란색을 사용할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 대부분의 잘 알려진 브랜드는 위에서 설명한 표준 색상 관례를 따르는 편이에요. 만약 확실하게 알고 싶다면, 사용하시는 기기의 설명서나 제조사 사양을 확인하는 것이 가장 정확합니다.\n이제는 스마트하게! 올바른 포트 사용 전략  \nUSB 포트 색깔이 의미하는 바를 제대로 이해하고 나니, 저의 기기 사용 습관도 완전히 바뀌었어요. 이전에는 그저 아무 데나 꽂았던 것을 이제는 각 기기에 가장 적합한 포트를 찾아 연결하기 시작한 거죠. 솔직히 말하면, 이 작은 변화가 가져온 효율성 향상에 정말 놀랐습니다.\n이제 제 스마트폰은 가능한 한 항상 빨간색이나 노란색 포트에 연결해서 충전합니다. 덕분에 배터리가 훨씬 빠르게 채워져서 더 이상 충전 때문에 애태우는 일이 없어요. 외장 하드 드라이브는 주저 없이 파란색이나 틸색 포트로 직행합니다. 덕분에 파일 백업이나 대용량 파일 전송이 예전보다 훨씬 빨라졌어요. 이전에 겪었던 긴 기다림은 이제 옛말이 되었죠. 키보드와 마우스 같은 경우는 검은색 USB 2.0 포트에도 충분히 잘 작동해서, 더 빠른 포트들은 정말 속도가 필요한 기기들을 위해 아껴둘 수 있게 되었습니다. 이렇게 전략적으로 사용하니, 괜히 느린 포트에 중요한 기기를 꽂아 시간을 낭비할 일이 없어져서 너무 좋아요!\n\n\nUSB-A 포트의 기능을 파악하는 데 색깔이 첫 번째 단서이긴 하지만, 그것이 전부는 아닙니다. 색깔 외에도 USB-A 포트에는 추가 정보를 제공하는 기호들이 종종 있어요. 예를 들어, 'SS' 또는 'SuperSpeed'라는 글자는 빠른 데이터 전송 기능을 의미하며, 때로는 'SS10'처럼 숫자가 함께 표시되어 10Gbps의 USB 3.1 Gen 2 속도를 나타내기도 합니다. 충전 전용 포트의 경우, 번개 모양이나 배터리 아이콘이 함께 표시되어 전력 출력만을 위한 포트임을 알려주기도 하니, 이런 작은 디테일에도 신경을 쓰는 것이 좋겠죠?\n이러한 USB 포트 색깔의 차이를 알게 되면서, 이제 제 기기들을 연결하는 행위는 단순한 습관이 아니라 의도적인 행동이 되었습니다. 이 지식은 단순히 PC를 사용할 때뿐만 아니라, 자동차, TV, 다른 여러 가전제품에 이르기까지 확장되어 모든 기기가 마땅히 받아야 할 최적의 전력과 속도를 누리게 해줍니다. 여러분도 오늘 알려드린 정보를 바탕으로 USB 포트를 더 스마트하게 사용하시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n✔️ USB 포트 색깔은 기능을 나타내는 비밀 코드: 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강/노랑, 하양 등 각 색깔은 데이터 전송 속도와 전력 공급량을 의미합니다.\n✔️ 잘못된 포트 사용은 성능 저하를 초래: 기기 특성에 맞지 않는 포트 사용 시 충전이 느려지거나 파일 전송 시간이 길어질 수 있습니다.\n✔️ 스마트한 매칭으로 효율 극대화: 스마트폰은 고출력(빨강/노랑), 외장하드는 고속(파랑/틸), 키보드/마우스는 표준(검정) 포트에 연결하세요.\n✔️ 색깔 외 추가 표식도 확인: 'SS', 'SuperSpeed' 문구나 번개/배터리 아이콘 등도 포트의 기능을 알려주는 중요한 단서입니다.\n이 정보를 통해 여러분의 디지털 라이프가 한층 더 편리해지기를 바랍니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\nA1: 일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\nQ2: 제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\nA2: 빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ3: USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\nA3: USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다. USB-C는 단자 모양이 동일하며, Thunderbolt 지원 여부나 USB Power Delivery (PD) 등의 추가 기능은 케이블이나 기기의 스펙을 통해 확인해야 합니다.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다.

Google AI Gemini와 Imagen이 탄생시킨 '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱으로 음식물 쓰레기는 줄이고, 요리의 즐거움은 키워보세요. 당신의 주방이 완전히 새로워집니다.\n\n\n매일 아침, 점심, 저녁. \"오늘 뭐 먹지?\"라는 질문은 우리 삶에서 영원히 끝나지 않을 숙제 같지 않나요? 냉장고 문을 열고 가득한 재료들을 보지만, 정작 뭘 해 먹어야 할지 막막했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 거예요. 결국 배달 앱을 켜면서 '아, 저 재료들 다 어떻게 하지…' 하고 죄책감을 느꼈던 순간들도 많았죠. 이런 우리 모두의 오래된 고민을 시원하게 해결해 줄 아주 특별한 주방 동반자가 드디어 세상에 나왔습니다. 바로 냉장고 사진 한 장으로 잠자고 있던 식재료에 새로운 생명을 불어넣어 주는 AI 요리 비서, '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱입니다.\n솔직히 말하면, 처음 이 아이디어가 생각났을때 '진짜 가능할까?' 하고 반신반의했어요. 하지만 Google의 개발자 지원 프로그램인 'Build with Google AI (바이브코딩)'를 통해 이 놀라운 아이디어가 현실이 되었답니다. 개발자들은 Google AI Studio라는 정말 강력한 웹 기반 도구를 활용해서, 최첨단 AI 모델인 Gemini와 Imagen을 손쉽게 테스트하고 앱에 빠르게 통합할 수 있었죠. 덕분에 복잡하고 어려운 AI 기술이 이제 우리 주방 안으로 쏙 들어와서, 요리 경험 자체를 완전히 바꿔놓을 준비를 마쳤습니다. 2025년, 이제 '오늘 뭐 먹지?' 고민은 이 앱에게 맡겨도 될 것 같아요.\n오늘은 이 혁신적인 앱이 어떻게 우리의 식생활을 혁신하는지, 그 심층적인 기능과 사용법을 저와 함께 자세히 파헤쳐 볼까 합니다. 기대되지 않으세요?\n  '냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 핵심 기능 Deep Dive\n이 앱이 시중에 나와 있는 수많은 레시피 앱들과 차원이 다르다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있는 이유는 바로 AI 기술이 접목된 네 가지 강력한 차별점 때문입니다. 단순히 레시피를 찾아주는 것을 넘어, 요리의 전 과정을 스마트하게 도와주는 진정한 파트너라고 할 수 있죠.\n\n\n① 눈으로 보고 '이해'하는 AI, Gemini\n'냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 가장 핵심적인 강점은 단연 Google의 막강한 멀티모달 AI, Gemini에 있습니다. 사용자가 냉장고 사진을 업로드하면, Gemini는 단순하게 이미지 속에서 형태만 인식하는 것을 넘어, 사진 속 식재료 하나하나를 마치 사람처럼 '이해'하기 시작합니다. 음… 예를 들면, 어지럽게 놓인 채소 더미, 누가 봐도 반쯤 사용한 소스병, 심지어 우유팩의 브랜드까지 식별해서 정확한 재료 목록을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 만들어내죠.\n제가 직접 테스트해 봤는데, 정말 놀랍더군요. 단순히 '채소'라고 인식하는 게 아니라 '시들기 시작한 상추', '반 개 남은 양파' 이런 식으로 상태까지 추론하더라고요! 이게 단순히 재료를 나열하는 것을 넘어서, 각 재료의 신선도나 현재 상태까지 고려해서 가장 최적의, 그리고 창의적인 레시피를 제안하는 기반이 됩니다. 이 부분이 정말 중요한데, 음식물 쓰레기를 줄이는 데 크게 기여할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요.\n② 상상력을 현실로, Imagen으로 보는 완성 요리\n\"이 레시피, 과연 맛있어 보일까?\" 요리 초보자든 베테랑이든, 이 질문은 요리에 대한 동기를 부여하는 아주 중요한 요소일 겁니다. 솔직히 글로만 된 레시피로는 감이 잘 안 올 때가 많잖아요? '냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이 점을 정확히 꿰뚫고 있었어요.\n레시피 카드 우측 상단의 작은 카메라 아이콘을 한번 눌러보세요. 그러면 Google의 최첨단 이미지 생성 모델인 Imagen이 마법을 부리기 시작합니다. 레시피의 이름과 상세한 설명을 바탕으로, 마치 전문 푸드 포토그래퍼가 갓 촬영한 듯한 먹음직스러운 완성 요리 이미지를 그 자리에서 바로 생성해 줍니다. 정말 감탄이 나오지 않을 수 없죠. 이건 그냥 보기 좋은 것을 넘어, 요리에 대한 영감을 제대로 불어넣어 주고, 어떤 그릇에 어떻게 담아야 할지 플레이팅 아이디어까지 제공해서 요리의 즐거움을 한층 더 끌어올려 줍니다. 제 생각엔 이 기능 하나만으로도 이 앱을 써볼 가치가 충분하다고 느껴졌어요.\n③ 나만의 맞춤형 셰프, 이제 당신의 취향을 말해보세요\nAI는 식별된 재료를 가장 효율적이고 맛있게 사용할 수 있는 레시피를 먼저 똑똑하게 추천합니다. 그런데 여기서 끝이 아니에요. 이건 정말 '개인 맞춤형 셰프'가 아닐까 싶을 정도로 디테일한 설정이 가능해요. 사용자는 '한식', '이탈리안', '퓨전' 등 원하는 요리 스타일을 선택할 수 있고요, 심지어 '채식', '글루텐 프리', '저탄수화물' 같은 특정 식단 필터를 적용해서 수많은 레시피 중에서 내 상황과 입맛에 정말 꼭! 맞는 '오늘의 메뉴'를 발견할 수 있습니다.\n냉장고 한 켠에서 잊고 있던 자투리 재료들 있잖아요? 이걸 어떻게 활용해야 할지 몰라 버리곤 했는데, 이제 AI가 그걸 기가 막히게 조합해서 창의적인 방법들을 제안해 줍니다. 아, 생각만 해도 뭔가 뿌듯하고 재미있지 않나요? 이건 요리 이상의 경험을 제공해 주는 것 같아요.\n④ 요리의 흐름을 돕는 스마트 기능들: 양손은 자유롭게, 장보기는 스마트하게\n요리하다 보면 양념 묻은 손으로 스마트폰 화면을 터치하느라 고생했던 경험, 다들 있으시죠? 저도 손에 밀가루 범벅인 채로 레시피 다음 단계를 넘기려다 포기한 적이 한두 번이 아니에요.

        "contentSnippet": "인공지능(AI)을 업무에 효과적으로 활용하고 싶지만, 어떤 질문을 던져야 할지 막막하셨나요? 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 마케팅, 개발, 콘텐츠 제작 등 각 분야 전문가들이 엄선한 프롬프트들을 제공하여, 복사-붙여넣기만으로 AI 생산성을 획기적으로 높여주는 비결을 담고 있습니다. 지금 바로 여러분의 AI 활용 능력을 한 단계 업그레이드할 기회를 잡으세요!\n\n\n\n \"오늘 날씨 어때?\" 같은 간단한 질문을 넘어, 인공지능(AI)을 정말 '일 잘하는 동료'처럼 활용하고 싶으신가요? 아마 많은 분이 AI 채팅창을 열었을 때, 무엇을 어떻게 질문해야 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있을지 막막했던 경험을 해보셨을 거예요. 제 주변에도 이런 고민을 하는 분들이 정말 많더라고요.\n맞아요, 좋은 질문이 좋은 답변을 만듭니다. 솔직히 저도 AI와 씨름하면서 '이게 최선인가?'라는 생각을 자주 했었거든요. 하지만 이제는 그럴 필요가 없습니다. 바로 이 지점에서 여러분의 AI 활용 능력을 극적으로 향상시켜 줄 비밀 무기, 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'를 소개합니다. 2025년, AI 시대의 생산성 혁명은 바로 여기에서 시작됩니다.\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'가 왜 지금 필요한가요?\n우리가 AI를 사용하는 목적은 단순히 정보 검색을 넘어, 아이디어를 얻거나, 콘텐츠를 만들거나, 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 처리하는 데 있습니다. 그런데 막상 AI와 대화하다 보면 원하는 답변을 얻기까지 수많은 시행착오를 겪기 마련이죠. 이런 비효율적인 과정이 반복되면 결국 AI 활용 자체를 포기하게 될 수도 있습니다.\n\n\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 바로 이런 문제점에서 출발했습니다. 이 플랫폼은 단순히 프롬프트를 모아놓은 것을 넘어, 마케팅, 소프트웨어 개발, 콘텐츠 제작부터 일상생활에 이르기까지, 각 분야의 전문가들이 실제로 사용하는 실용적인 프롬프트들을 엄선하여 제공하는 보물창고입니다. 저는 이 사이트를 처음 접했을 때, '아, 드디어 AI와 제대로 대화할 수 있는 길을 찾았구나!' 하고 무릎을 탁 쳤습니다.\n  핵심 요점: 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 AI 활용의 시행착오를 줄이고, 구체적이고 효과적인 질문을 통해 사용자가 원하는 결과물을 빠르고 정확하게 얻도록 돕는 것을 목표로 합니다. AI를 더 이상 어렵게 느끼지 않도록 돕는 가장 스마트한 지름길이죠.\n  'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub' 파헤치기: 어떤 곳인가요?\n앞서 말씀드렸지만, 이곳은 일반적인 프롬프트 모음 사이트와는 차원이 다릅니다. 이 사이트의 목표는 사용자가 AI 앞에서 더 이상 망설이지 않고, 구체적이고 효과적인 질문을 통해 원하는 결과물을 얻도록 돕는 것입니다. 마치 나만의 AI 어시스턴트에게 정확한 지시를 내리는 법을 배우는 것과 같다고 할까요? 다양한 분야의 전문가들이 직접 사용하며 효과를 검증한 프롬프트들이기에 그 신뢰도는 두말할 나위가 없습니다.\n특히 흥미로운 점은, 단순히 질문 템플릿을 제공하는 것을 넘어 AI 챗봇의 정체성, 역할, 말투까지 지정할 수 있는 '챗봇 지침(Gems & GPTs)' 섹션이 있다는 거예요. 이건 정말 대단한 기능이라고 생각합니다. 나만의 전문 AI 챗봇을 만들 수 있는 가능성을 열어주는 거죠.\n  초보도 전문가처럼! '프롬프트 허브' 완벽 활용 4단계\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 직관적인 디자인 덕분에 사용법이 정말 간단합니다. 저는 처음에 혹시 어렵지 않을까 걱정했는데, 막상 사용해보니 전혀 그렇지 않더라고요! 여러분도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 핵심적인 활용법을 4단계로 나누어 자세히 알려드릴게요.\n\n\n1단계: 두 개의 보물상자, '분야별 프롬프트'와 '챗봇 지침'\n사이트에 접속하면 상단에 두 개의 주요 탭이 눈에 뜁니다. 마치 잘 정리된 서랍처럼 말이죠.\n분야별 프롬프트: 마케터, 개발자, 학생, 작가 등 누구나 일상과 업무에서 바로 사용할 수 있는 일반적인 프롬프트 200개가 모여 있습니다. 대부분의 사용자가 가장 많이 이용하게 될 메인 공간이라고 보시면 돼요. 저도 이 섹션에서 정말 많은 아이디어를 얻었습니다.\n챗봇 지침 (Gems & GPTs): 이곳은 조금 더 특별한 공간입니다. 단순한 일회성 질문이 아니라, AI 챗봇의 정체성, 역할, 말투를 지정하여 '100개의 나만의 전문 챗봇'을 만들기 위한 '시스템 지침'들이 모여있죠. 현재는 채널 멤버십 회원 전용으로, 암호를 통해 접근할 수 있다고 합니다. 이 기능은 정말 AI 활용의 게임 체인저가 될 것이라고 확신합니다.\n2단계: 나에게 꼭 맞는 프롬프트를 찾아라! 스마트 필터링\n'분야별 프롬프트' 탭을 선택하면, 마케팅, 소프트웨어 개발, 콘텐츠 제작, 비즈니스/생산성 등 다양한 카테고리 버튼이 나타납니다. 'All' 버튼을 누르면 모든 분야의 프롬프트를 한눈에 볼 수 있고요. 특정 분야(예: '디자인/창작')를 클릭하면 해당 카테고리에 속한 프롬프트만 깔끔하게 필터링되어 나타납니다. 아이콘과 함께 표시되어 원하는 분야를 쉽게 찾을 수 있어서 정말 편리합니다. 원하는 정보를 빠르게 찾을 수 있다는 건, 결국 시간 절약으로 이어진다는 뜻이겠죠!\n3단계: 마법의 버튼, '프롬프트 복사'\n마음에 드는 프롬프트를 찾으셨나요? 각 카드에는 제목과 설명, 그리고 실제 프롬프트 내용이 보기 쉽게 정리되어 있습니다. 이제 가장 편리한 기능을 사용할 차례입니다. 바로 '프롬프트 복사' 버튼이죠!\n프롬프트 아래에 있는 '프롬프트 복사' 버튼을 클릭해 보세요. 단 한 번의 클릭으로 전체 프롬프트 내용이 클립보드에 복사됩니다. 버튼이 '복사 완료!'로 바뀌는 시각적 피드백 덕분에 혼동할 염려도 전혀 없죠. 이 기능 덕분에 저도 작업 속도가 정말 빨라졌습니다. 이제 여러분이 사용하는 AI 챗봇(ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude 등)에 돌아가 붙여넣기만 하면 됩니다. 정말 쉽죠?\n4단계 (가장 중요!): 나만의 옷을 입히자! 커스터마이징의 힘\n'Prompt Hub'의 프롬프트들은 훌륭한 '템플릿'입니다. 여기서 중요한 점은, 복사한 프롬프트를 그대로 사용하기보다는 [ ] 로 표시된 부분을 여러분의 상황에 맞게 수정하여 사용하는 것이 훨씬 더 효과적이라는 겁니다.\n예를 들어, 복사한 프롬프트가 다음과 같다면:\n신제품 [제품 이름]을 홍보하기 위한 인스타그램 게시물 아이디어 5가지를 생성해 줘. 타겟 고객은 [타겟 고객 설명]이고, 목표는 참여도 증진이야. 이모지와 해시태그를 포함해 줘.\n이렇게 수정해서 질문하는 겁니다:\n신제품 '글로우업 비건 세럼'을 홍보하기 위한 인스타그램 게시물 아이디어 5가지를 생성해 줘. 타겟 고객은 '환경에 관심이 많은 20대 여성'이고, 목표는 참여도 증진이야. 이모지와 해시태그를 포함해 줘.\n이 작은 수정만으로 AI는 훨씬 더 정확하고 만족스러운 결과물을 제공할 것입니다. AI는 우리가 던지는 질문에 따라 무한한 잠재력을 보여주니까요. 마치 요리할 때 레시피를 기본으로 나만의 재료를 추가하는 것과 비슷하다고 생각하시면 돼요.\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 프롬프트를 복사한 뒤, [ ] 안의 내용을 본인의 상황에 맞게 꼭 수정하는 과정을 잊지 마세요. 이 단계가 AI의 잠재력을 최대로 끌어내고, 만족스러운 결과를 얻는 핵심 열쇠입니다. 복사-붙여넣기만으로는 100%의 효과를 보기 어렵습니다.\n✨ 이런 분들에게 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'를 강력 추천합니다!\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 정말 다양한 분야의 사람들에게 큰 도움이 될 수 있는 도구라고 생각합니다. 특히 다음과 같은 분들이라면, 이 플랫폼을 통해 업무 효율과 생산성을 2배 이상 끌어올릴 수 있을 거예요.\nAI 마케터: 바이럴 캠페인 아이디어나 광고 카피 문구, SEO 전략 수립이 막막할 때. 혹은 고객 세분화 분석 등 복잡한 마케팅 전략을 세울 때도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n개발자 & 기획자: 코드 리팩토링, API 설계 초안, 단위 테스트 케이스 생성, 아니면 복잡한 기능 요구사항을 명확하게 정리하고 싶을 때. 개발 과정의 막힌 부분을 시원하게 뚫어줄 겁니다.\n콘텐츠 크리에이터: 유튜브 스크립트 초안, 블로그 글 구성, 소설 아이디어, 심지어는 SNS 게시물 문구까지! 영감이 필요할 때마다 이 플랫폼이 든든한 조력자가 되어줄 거예요.\n학생 & 연구원: 복잡한 개념을 쉽게 이해하고 싶거나, 에세이 개요를 잡고, 논문 초록을 작성해야 할 때. 방대한 자료를 요약하는 데도 탁월한 성능을 발휘합니다.\n모든 직장인: 회의록 요약, 보고서 초안 작성, 이메일 작성, 발표 자료 구성 등 일상적인 업무를 더 빠르고 효율적으로 처리하고 싶을 때. 야근이 줄어드는 마법을 경험하실지도 모릅니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1.

ISA 계좌나 연금 계좌에서도 투자할 수 있는 국내 투자운용사의 금현물 ETF 등은 투자가 쉬우면서 인플레이션 방어 역할을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n(3) 대출금 상환 우선순위 설정하기\n금리가 내려가면 대출 이자가 줄어들어 숨통이 트일 수 있지만, 부채가 많다면 우선 갚는 게 최선입니다. 특히 금리가 높은 신용대출 상환은 최우선순위로 둬야 하고요. 금리가 오를 때는 변동금리 대출의 부담이 커지므로, 저금리 시기에 미리 갚거나 고정금리로 바꿔두는 게 안전합니다. 매달 일정 비율을 정해 꾸준히 상환하고, 보너스나 여윳돈이 생기면 추가로 갚아나가면 부채 관리가 조금 더 수월해질 수 있어요.\n물가와 금리는 서로 맞물리며 경제의 큰 균형을 만들어 갑니다. 금리가 오르고 내리는 과정은 결국 과열을 식히고, 또 침체를 막으며 경제가 스스로 균형을 찾아가는 흐름이 반복되는 거예요. 그 안에서 우리는 때론 불안에 떨고, 때론 기회를 기대하기도 합니다. 투자자로서 이 파도 같은 변동성에 휩쓸리지 않으려면 길게 보는 안목과 인내심을 가져야 합니다. 그리고 자산을 분산 투자하고, 주기적인 리밸런싱을 통해 포트폴리오를 점검하며 시장의 흐름에 유연하게 대응하는 게 중요합니다. 이렇게 하면 금리와 물가의 파동 속에서도 자산을 지켜내고 성장시킬 수 있습니다.\n경제는 늘 변하지만, 물가와 금리가 가리키는 신호를 이해하면 변동성은 두려움의 대상이 아니라 기회의 신호입니다. 우리가 경제를 공부하는 건 이 거대한 흐름 속에서 흔들리지 않고 내 자산을 지키기 위한 것이라는 점을 기억하세요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 이제현",
