        "content:encodedSnippet": "Previously in this series:\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 1: A Minimal Coding Agent\nBuilding AI Agents in Kotlin – Part 2: A Deeper Dive Into Tools\nTwo articles in, and our coding agent can already do quite a bit. It can explore projects, read and write code, execute shell commands, and run tests. Adding a definition of done (DoD) in our last article gave it the feedback loop it needed – the agent now iterates until all tests pass, not until it decides it’s done.\nWe should be celebrating, right? Well, yes and no.\nAs the agent gets more capable, debugging becomes more challenging. Each tool adds surface area. The DoD loop adds more calls and tokens. Evaluation runs can take hours, and when something fails, it is often unclear what failed or where the issue started.\nOur agent can solve tasks now. Too bad we can’t see how.\nThis becomes a problem when you want to improve the agent, debug failures, or estimate costs. In this article, we work through this visibility gap. We start with the obvious options (they don’t quite work), review common observability tools for LLM apps, and integrate tracing with Langfuse. The result is a step-by-step view of the agent’s actions, including cost per action. Along the way, we uncover behavioral patterns and even find a bug we didn’t know existed.\nLet’s start by understanding what we’re missing.\nYour agent story\nWhen your agent completes a coding task, it produces a chain of decisions and actions: Read this file, analyze that function, modify this code, run those tests. This chain is the agent’s trajectory, and it tells the story of how the agent works.\nTrajectories matter because they reveal where the agent wastes time and where it goes off track. They show you when the agent reads the same file 47 times, or why it rewrites half your codebase when you asked for a simple bug fix. In short, you can’t improve what you can’t observe.\nUp to now, we’ve been getting by with this simple setup:\nhandleEvents {  \n    onToolCallStarting { ctx ->  \n        println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")  \n    }  \n}\nThis was fine for the early steps. It at least showed activity. But we’ve outgrown it. Without full parameters and observations, we can’t understand agent behavior in enough detail. And if we print everything, the console turns into noise: object dumps, file contents, and error messages all mixed together.\nWe need something better.\n“Just turn on logging”\nLet’s try the obvious solution first. Koog has built-in debug logging, so we switch Logback from ERROR to DEBUG and run it again:\n\n\n\n\nThree minutes and thousands of lines later: Informative? Yes. Convenient? No! \nVerbose logs have their place. In production, they help with postmortems. They also help when you want to extract insights and analyze behavior patterns across many runs. But when you’re debugging a single run and trying to understand why your agent is stuck in a loop, you need something built for humans, not statistical analysis.\nThe money trail\nWhile those logs aren’t ideal for debugging, they did remind us about something else we should be tracking: usage statistics. OpenAI’s dashboard provides detailed breakdowns of API consumption per key. It answers one question quickly: Are we burning through our budget?\nBut it still doesn’t answer the question that matters during development: What does one run cost?\n\n\n\n\nOkay, $25 in one week. Useful, but not the complete picture. The OpenAI dashboard does what it’s designed to do: track organization-level API usage. But for agent development, we need run-level insights. We can see the total, but not which tasks cost $0.50 and which cost $5.00.\nNow add more moving parts. If we split work across sub-agents and use different providers for specific steps (to be discussed in upcoming articles), we end up with multiple dashboards and no single view of the true cost of a run. And if several people share the same agent setup, it gets even harder to see who spent what and where.\nThe API key approach works for one agent, one provider, and limited runs. It’s a start, but it doesn’t scale. We need observability.\nThe four-line integration\nWe’re not the first to encounter this issue. Over the last few years, an ecosystem of observability tools has formed around LLM apps and agents. There are proprietary tools such as Weights & Biases Weave and LangSmith, as well as open-source options like Langfuse, Opik, Arize Phoenix, OpenLLMetry, Helicone, OpenLIT, and Lunary. Some are cloud-based, others support self-hosting, and some offer both. Each comes with its own strengths and trade-offs.\nAfter evaluating several options, our team chose Langfuse. The decision came down to practical factors: It’s open source with a self-hosted option (so traces stay under your control), it offers a free cloud tier for getting started, the UI makes it easier to inspect traces, and the team is responsive when questions come up.\nThe integration itself is straightforward. Koog needs four lines to connect to Langfuse:\n) {\n+   install(OpenTelemetry) {  \n+       setVerbose(true) \n+       addLangfuseExporter()  \n+   }\n    handleEvents {  \n        // existing handlers remain\n    }\n}\nThat’s it.\nIf you use another OpenTelemetry-compatible service, generic OpenTelemetry integration works as well.\nA quick note about the setVerbose(true): Koog sends only telemetry metadata by default. Full details are sent only if you enable verbose mode. Prompts and responses remain hidden, which makes sense when traces can include customer data. During agent development, you often need full visibility, and verbose mode enables that.\nSetting up Langfuse takes about five minutes. For this article, we’re using their free cloud instance, but you can also run the full stack locally in Docker.\nCreate an account at cloud.langfuse.com.\nCreate an organization.\nCreate a project.\nClick Create API Key.\nYou’ll get three values:\nexport LANGFUSE_HOST=\"https://cloud.langfuse.com\"\nexport LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=\"<your-public-key>\"\nexport LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=\"<your-secret-key>\"\nKoog reads these values from the execution environment. If you need to pass them in code, you can pass them directly to addLangfuseExporter. Here’s our complete agent with observability enabled:\nval executor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"))\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    promptExecutor = executor,\n    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5Codex,\n    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n        tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))\n        tool(ExecuteShellCommandTool(JvmShellCommandExecutor(), PrintShellCommandConfirmationHandler()))\n    },\n    systemPrompt = \"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled programmer tasked with updating the provided codebase according to the given task.\n        Your goal is to deliver production-ready code changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase and solve given task.\n        Ensure minimal possible changes done - that guarantees minimal impact on existing functionality.\n        \n        You have shell access to execute commands and run tests.\n        After investigation, define expected behavior with test scripts, then iterate on your implementation until the tests pass.\n        Verify your changes don't break existing functionality through regression testing, but prefer running targeted tests over full test suites.\n        Note: the codebase may be fully configured or freshly cloned with no dependencies installed - handle any necessary setup steps.\n        \"\"\".trimIndent(),\n    strategy = singleRunStrategy(ToolCalls.SEQUENTIAL),\n    maxIterations = 400\n) {\n    install(OpenTelemetry) {\n        setVerbose(true) // Send full strings instead of HIDDEN placeholders\n        addLangfuseExporter()\n    }\n    handleEvents {\n        onToolCallStarting { ctx ->\n            println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args: ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nThe first trace\nLet’s start with a simple task: Find the main() function in your project. Run it, wait for it to finish, and then open the Tracing tab in your Langfuse project.\n\n\n\n\nImmediately, the table displays something useful: the Total Cost column. Koog reports token counts, Langfuse applies pricing, and you can see that finding main() costs $0.016.\nOpen the trace to see the full run.\n\n\n\n\nThe left-hand panel shows your agent’s trajectory: messages, tool calls, and observations in order, with indentation indicating the call hierarchy. The right-hand panel displays details for each step: prompts, responses, tool parameters, and per-span cost breakdown.\nAt the bottom, you’ll also see an execution graph that visualizes the flow. For more details on Koog’s graph-based strategies, check out the documentation. You can also read a deep dive by the Koog tech lead: Mixing the Secret AI Sauce: How to Design a Flexible, Graph-Based Strategy in Koog.\nDiscovering issues through observability\nWhile preparing examples for this article, we noticed a failed tool call highlighted in red.\n\n\n\n\nThe observation was:\nendLine=400 must be <= lineCount=394 or -1\nThe agent requested lines 0–400, but the file had only 394 lines. This points to a limitation in our tool implementation. Instead of failing, it should clamp the range and return the available lines (0–394), allowing the agent to continue. Without traces, this kind of issue often gets buried in logs. With traces, you see it in the exact run, at the exact step, and with the exact input.\nThat’s why observability matters. It shows not just that something failed, but also how and why, which makes fixes much easier.\nWorking with evaluation runs\nSingle traces are great for debugging, but evaluation runs need a batch view. \nWhen you run your agent across multiple SWE-bench Verified tasks (a standard benchmark for coding agents), you want grouped traces and aggregated cost.\nLangfuse supports this through sessions. Add a session ID as a trace attribute:\ninstall(OpenTelemetry) {\n    setVerbose(true)\n    addLangfuseExporter(  \n        traceAttributes = listOf(  \n            CustomAttribute(\"langfuse.session.id\", \"eval-run-1\"),  \n        )  \n    )\n}\nYou can also add other attributes, such as user IDs or environment tags. See the trace-level attributes documentation if you need them. For now, session grouping is enough.\nWith this configuration, traces from the evaluation share a session ID. In Langfuse, navigate to the Sessions tab to see aggregate duration and total cost.\n\n\n\n\nIn our run, we executed 50 SWE-bench Verified tasks (out of 500). With ten parallel instances, the run took 30 minutes and cost $66. This gives a baseline for future experiments: success rate, runtime, and cost.\nLangfuse doesn’t show success scores by default. That’s expected. Tracing records what happened, not whether a run passed. If you want success metrics in Langfuse, your evaluation harness needs to score each attempt and report custom scores. It’s worth implementing if you have the supporting infrastructure.\nLooking ahead\nObservability isn’t just about debugging. It’s also how you learn about the agent’s behavior. \nWith a few lines of code, we turned the agent from a black box into something you can inspect. We caught that line-range error that would likely have gone unnoticed. We learned that our 50-task evaluation costs $66. And we can now see which tasks consume tokens and which run efficiently.\nIn the next article, we’ll introduce a sub-agent pattern: Delegate specific tasks to smaller, cheaper models. With traces in place, you can decide what to delegate based on what the agent does in each run. No more guessing.\nResources\nComplete code for this article\nKoog OpenTelemetry documentation\nKoog Langfuse integration\nLangfuse OpenTelemetry support\nThank you for reading!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we love seeing the developer community grow and thrive. That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference — the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and to contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this edition, we highlight four projects spanning Rust, Go, and JavaScript. Different as they are, each shares the same goal: keeping systems reliable.\nfrp\nOriginally created to make it easier to share local APIs with teammates, frp (Fast Reverse Proxy) has grown into a global open-source favorite. It’s lightweight, easy to configure, and supports multiple protocols – perfect for developers who need to share local services or access remote environments without complex network setup.\nAs frp grew into a complex codebase, I switched to GoLand, which significantly improved my productivity. Intelligent code completion, a powerful debugger, seamless refactoring, and intuitive navigation became indispensable in my everyday workflow.\nSince frp attracts contributors with different levels of experience, GoLand has become a vital tool in simplifying their workflows – with its ready-to-use, beginner-friendly environment, it drastically reduces the learning curve and the setup work that often frustrates beginners. I confidently recommend GoLand as the go-to IDE for contributing to frp or any other Go project.\n— fatedier, frp creator\nThe team’s roadmap includes lightweight VPN-like capabilities that will allow multiple frpc nodes to form virtual networks, along with a major v2 overhaul aimed at delivering advanced functionality across both Layer 7 (application) and Layer 4 (transport) features.\nSniffnet\nSniffnet, written entirely in Rust, lets users visualize network traffic in real time. It was designed as an intuitive, easy-to-use monitoring tool that allows anyone – not just network experts – to comfortably analyze their internet activity. Instead of unreadable packet data, Sniffnet displays clear, flow-level details such as domain names, countries, and services, giving users an immediate understanding of their network traffic.\nWhat I love most about RustRover is how seamlessly it integrates with my usual workflows – using rustfmt, clippy, and testing tools. And since I’ve used other JetBrains IDEs in the past, RustRover instantly feels like home with its familiar, intuitive interface.\n— Giuliano Bellini, Sniffnet creator\nSniffnet’s upcoming roadmap includes process identification, custom IP blacklists, remote host monitoring via an agent, and OS-level firewall integrations – all aimed at making network monitoring secure and approachable for everyone.\nVitest\nVitest was designed to be a simple testing tool for Vite applications, with a focus on the shared build configuration. Over time, it’s evolved into a go-to testing framework for fast, reliable JavaScript testing across ecosystems.\nSince the early days, JetBrains has collaborated with the team to provide the best IDE experience. My favorite feature is the debug button – I always struggled with JavaScript’s built-in debugger before trying it in WebStorm.\n— Vladimir, Vitest maintainer\nThe Vitest team continues to innovate with the latest developments of the Browser Mode and upcoming improvements to benchmarking and type-checking support – all in service of making testing easy and approachable.\nbottom\nbottom started as a personal spin on gotop and similar tools. Originally a résumé project, it gradually evolved into a popular terminal-based system monitor built in Rust. The project was originally called “rustop”, but since that name was already taken, the creator simply took things in the opposite direction and called it “bottom”!\nI regularly use RustRover for open-source projects like bottom – it’s packed with great features, and it’s convenient to stay within the JetBrains ecosystem since I use other JetBrains products at work.\n— Clement Tsang, bottom creator\nBottom proves that even the simplest tools can evolve into powerful, community-driven utilities, and that approachable design matters, even on the command line.\nThese projects showcase a common truth: Great developer experience happens when tools get out of your way. With JetBrains IDEs enhancing everything from code navigation to collaboration, these teams turn ideas into usable, elegant tools.\nExplore these projects, contribute if you can, or start your own! RustRover, WebStorm, CLion, Rider, RubyMine, DataGrip, IntelliJ IDEA, and PyCharm are free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute.\nMore from this series\n                                                        \nCLion and the Open-Source Community: Growing Together\nFrom the beginning, CLion has been shaped by the needs of C and C++ developers around the world.

The kotlinx-benchmark library helps you measure and compare performance across different implementations or hardware configurations.\nHowever, raw text results only take you so far. Sometimes you need to visualize your data, not just read it. That’s where Kotlin notebooks come in.\nKotlin notebooks combine the expressiveness of Kotlin with the interactivity of notebook-style development.

This release contains important bug-fixes as well as feature updates.\nLet’s take a look at what’s been improved.\nRider 2025.3.0.4\nMulti-agent experience in the AI Chat window: Junie and Claude Agent\nClaude Agent has become the first third-party AI agent natively integrated into JetBrains IDEs. With its addition, JetBrains introduces a multi-agent experience that brings even more flexibility and power to your development workflow. Now that Claude Agent and Junie are available in the same chat interface, you can switch between agents seamlessly and get the right kind of assistance for every task.\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to start working with any agent now is to launch it directly from the AI chat. However, the Junie plugin (and some of its features exclusively) will still be available for you if you prefer to use Junie it this way.\nLearn more here.\nTransparent AI quota tracking in the IDE\nYou can now view your remaining AI credits, renewal date, and top-up balance directly inside your IDE, and if you run out of credits, you can initiate a top-up from there as well. This update makes it easier to monitor and manage your AI resources – bringing more clarity and convenience to your AI usage. \n\n\n\n\nIn Junie, if your task uses more than 1.2 AI credits, you will get a notification. This feature is currently available in the Junie plugin and will be coming to the AI chat soon.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about AI quotas in this blog post.\n[Coming Soon] Bring Your Own Key\nWith BYOK, you will be able to connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI API-compatible local model using your own API key, without logging into JetBrains AI. This gives you more control over how you use AI in IntelliJ IDEA, and it’s ideal if you prefer to work with a specific provider.\nThis setup is particularly powerful when paired with a JetBrains AI subscription (including the free tier), which provides enhanced completion, extra models, and bonus credits while still allowing you to use your own key for chat and agents.\nLearn more here. \nGame development\nRider now provides cloud-powered multi-line code completion for shaders in Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot projects.For Godot developers, cloud completion suggestions are also available for GDScript files.\nWorking with databases\nRider replaces the term query console with query file – because consoles have essentially always been files, and it’s time the UI reflected that. We’ve also simplified the workflow, making it more discoverable and consistent. You can learn more about the change in this post. \nNotable fixes included in this build:\nWe’ve resolved the issue of excessive memory usage when opening .NET 6 solutions [RIDER-132952].\nRider now ships with the correct IJent version, restoring full WSL support. Git, Docker integration, terminals, and device discovery over WSL work reliably again. [IJPL-219668]\nDeploying to Android devices now works reliably again. Rider correctly uploads the application APK file, even when a previous version is already installed on the device. [RIDER-132740]\nRendered documentation now correctly displays code containing < and > characters. [RIDER-119249]\nSearch Everywhere now returns results in a stable, predictable order. [RIDER-132113]\nSource-generated files from System.Text.Json are now detected correctly and no longer produce false errors. [RIDER-132634]\nFor the complete list of resolved issues, please refer to our issue tracker. \nDownload Rider 2025.3.0.4\n                                                    \nReSharper 2025.3.0.4 \n\n\n\n\nHere are the most notable fixes included in this update:\nSQL/NoSQL support can now be excluded from the dotUltimate installer. An installation key is available for silent setups, allowing teams to omit these features when not needed. [RSRP-501992]\nThe Unit Test Output panel in Out-of-Process mode now shows vertical scrollbars correctly, making long test output fully navigable again. [RSRP-501537]\nFor the full list of issues resolved in this build, please refer to our issue tracker.\nDownload ReSharper 2025.3.0.4\n                                                    \nYou can download the latest builds from our website (Rider, ReSharper) or via the Toolbox App. You can also update Rider as a snap.",

Whether you’re trying to keep reports error-free, managing user roles, or setting up environments, Datalore 2025.6 adds new tools that will help you stay organized and productive. \nIssue center\nThe issue center is available to help your teams monitor and resolve errors in published reports. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike notebooks, reports run code behind the scenes and hide technical details from viewers, so identifying and fixing issues in them can be difficult. The issue center tracks the errors from all reports in a workspace and displays them in one place, where you can search, filter, and resolve them with ease. Read more\nUsages tab for databases\nDatabase connections now include a Usages tab, where you can see all the notebooks and cells that rely on a particular connection. This makes it easier to understand where a connection is used, track dependencies, and quickly reuse or update code across your workspace. Read more\nOption to change a user role to viewer\nIn Datalore On-Premises, you can now directly change someone’s role from user to viewer without having to delete the existing user account and then create a viewer from scratch. Because the licensing for Datalore On-Premises is based on the number of user seats, this streamlined role change can help you optimize license usage. Read more\nWe also improved the viewer UI to deliver a cleaner experience for those who can view notebooks and reports but don’t need to edit them.\nAll reports and Recents tabs\nA new All reports tab on the home page allows you to access all the reports available to you, including those shared with you directly or via a workspace, as well as any publicly available reports that you have previously accessed. The Recents tab now includes recently opened reports in addition to notebooks.\n\n\n\n\nInteractive report recalculation\nWhen reports are opened, it’s crucial that they contain accurate data. Datalore users can configure whether report viewers are prompted to recalculate interactive reports on open, and instance administrators can select the default behavior in the Admin panel. \nWe’ve added the option to recalculate all reports automatically, ensuring that viewers always see the most up-to-date results without requiring manual confirmation.\nAbility to share individual reports from shared workspaces\nYou can now share individual reports without sharing the whole workspace or making the report public.\nAutomatic environment installation\nWe’ve added automatic environment installation for pip-based environments on machine start. When you specify an environment and Python version in the Admin panel, they will be installed as the machine boots. This feature uses uv as the package manager.\nTo learn more about all the updates, see the What’s new page in the Datalore documentation.\n      \n      Upgrade to 2025.6",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Search Everywhere dialog is one of the most important entry points in the IntelliJ Platform. To future-proof this core feature and ensure its optimal performance in remote development, we have completely rewritten the underlying architecture, and we’re introducing a brand-new API for plugin developers.\nThis is a critical update for anyone contributing custom results to Search Everywhere, particularly for plugins that need to support remote environments.\nWhy the rewrite? The challenge of remote development\nThe need for a new API stemmed directly from our ongoing commitment to remote development.\nThe original SearchEverywhereContributor extension point was designed for the traditional, monolithic (local) IDE architecture. It coupled the search result data with the UI renderer responsible for displaying that data. This tight coupling became a significant blocker for our split-architecture remote solution:\nThe backend/frontend problem: In remote development, search logic often runs on a powerful backend machine, but the results must be displayed on the lightweight frontend.\nSerialization issue: Because SearchEverywhereContributor coupled data and presentation, it was impossible to reliably serialize third-party search results – both the data and its appearance – and safely send them across the network from the backend process to the frontend client.\nTo solve this, we initiated a deep rewrite of Search Everywhere to separate data and logic from UI presentation, enabling seamless and performant remote execution for all plugins.\nThe new API: Separation of data and UI\nFrontend components\nThese components primarily manage the user interface and presentation logic.\nSeTab\n\nAn interface representing a single tab within the Search Everywhere dialog.\nLives on the frontend only.\nSeTabFactory\n\nA factory for creating SeTab instances.\nServes as an extension point for adding new tab types.\nCore data and logic (backend/frontend)\nThese components are responsible for fetching and structuring the search results.\nSeItemsProvider\n\nThe conceptual analog of the older SearchEverywhereContributor.\nCan run on both the backend and frontend.\nReturns search results that include a serializable presentation – a standardized way to describe the item’s appearance. By ensuring that the results returned by SeItemsProvider include a serializable presentation, we can transmit them over the network and reliably render the results on the client, regardless of which process generated them.\nSeItemsProviderFactory\n\nA factory for creating SeItemsProvider instances.\nServes as an extension point for adding new result sources.\nMigration and compatibility\nSeLegacyItemPresentationProvider\n\nA simplified mechanism designed to help existing SearchEverywhereContributor implementations adapt quickly for remote development compatibility.\nWhat this means for your plugin\nWe have implemented adapters for all existing legacy SearchEverywhereContributor implementations.\nIn a monolith (local) environment: Existing plugins should continue to work almost exactly as before, with no immediate changes required.\nIn a remote development environment (2025.2 onwards): The new Search Everywhere architecture is now enabled by default. Plugins supporting remote execution must either implement the new API or ensure their legacy results use a serializable presentation format that our adapters can manage. For a simpler, temporary presentation method, you can use SeLegacyItemPresentationProvider.\nThe path forward – Migration recommended\nWhile the adapters provide a temporary bridge, we encourage all plugin developers to try the new API and provide feedback while it’s in the experimental phase. Once the new API has been refined based on the community’s input, we will start deprecating the old API.\nRollout plan\nWe are committed to a smooth transition and are rolling out the new Search Everywhere architecture gradually:\n2025.2: The new Search Everywhere architecture is enabled by default in remote development.\n2026.1 (planned): The new architecture is enabled by default in monolith environments.\n2026.2 (tentative): The new API is no longer experimental, and the old API is deprecated\nWe understand that changing a core API is a significant step, but this rewrite is essential for the future of the IntelliJ Platform and your ability to serve users in modern, remote environments.\nWe are excited to see the improved performance and remote capabilities this change will bring to your plugins!\n\n\n\n\nThe IntelliJ Platform team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Running TeamCity in Kubernetes has always been possible, but it often required knowing your way around both systems pretty well.\nTeamCity is flexible and easy to tune, and Kubernetes provides excellent tools for running applications at scale. However, bringing the two together smoothly wasn’t always straightforward.\nThe new TeamCity Operator is designed to change that. It uses custom resources to automate the management of your TeamCity server life cycle. For example, it allows you to automatically deploy new servers and perform zero-downtime upgrades (see the Kubernetes documentation for more details).\nAlthough the TeamCity Operator was originally designed to support internal use cases, interest from users running sizable Kubernetes-based installations encouraged us to make it open source. It’s now publicly available and ready for you to explore.\nWhy an operator?\nThe most common way to deploy applications to Kubernetes is through Helm charts. Helm works well for many services, but it has limitations when it comes to applications that require orchestrated, stateful operations, such as controlled upgrades, multi-node setups, or zero-downtime updates.\nTeamCity fits squarely into this category. Its life cycle is complex and nuanced. Updates require sequencing, certain states must be preserved, and there are moments when two versions must temporarily coexist.\n\nTeamCity OperatorTeamCity Helm charts\nGo applicationCollection of templated YAML files\nSingle object that controls everything needed for TeamCityNo control over the life cycle\nMinimal need to think about dependencies in KubernetesUpdateable fields in objects only\n\n\n\n\n\nKubernetes operators exist precisely for these cases. An operator is an application that runs inside a cluster and encodes expert knowledge about how to deploy, upgrade, and maintain a particular system. Instead of asking you to understand every nuance of TeamCity’s Kubernetes behavior, the TeamCity Operator takes on that work.\nHow it works\nThe TeamCity Operator introduces a new Kubernetes custom resource that represents a TeamCity installation. When you apply it to the cluster, the TeamCity Operator inspects this object and turns it into a fully configured, running TeamCity instance.\nIn practice, this means the TeamCity Operator:\nCreates and configures the necessary StatefulSets.\nEnsures the startup and shutdown sequences are executed correctly.\nApplies changes to the TeamCity installation based on updates to the custom resource specification.\nManages upgrades, including optional zero-downtime ones.\nCoordinates the main and secondary nodes in multi-node setups.\n\n\n\n\nThe TeamCity Operator continuously watches the Kubernetes API for changes. When you update the TeamCity custom resource spec (for example, by changing the version or resource settings), the TeamCity Operator reconciles the actual state with the desired one.\nIn other words, you declare what TeamCity should look like, and the TeamCity Operator makes your vision a reality.\nExample: Deploying a TeamCity main node with an external database\nTo give you a concrete idea of how the TeamCity Operator is used in practice, here is an example of deploying a standalone TeamCity main node that connects to an external database.\nThis example demonstrates how database configuration is passed via a Kubernetes Secret and how the TeamCity custom resource defines the main node, resources, and storage.\napiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  connectionProperties.password: DB_PASSWORD\n  connectionProperties.user: DB_USER\n  connectionUrl: DB_CONNECTION_STRING # format jdbc:mysql://DB_HOST:DB_PORT/SCHEMA_NAME\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: database-properties\n---\napiVersion: jetbrains.com/v1beta1\nkind: TeamCity\nmetadata:\n  name: teamcity-with-database\n  namespace: default\n  finalizers:\n    - \"teamcity.jetbrains.com/finalizer\"\nspec:\n  image: jetbrains/teamcity-server\n  databaseSecret:\n    secret: database-properties\n  mainNode:\n    name: main-node\n    spec:\n      env:\n        AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: \"eu-west-1\"\n      requests:\n        cpu: \"900m\"\n        memory: \"1512Mi\"\n  dataDirVolumeClaim:\n    name: teamcity-data-dir\n    volumeMount:\n      name: teamcity-data-dir\n      mountPath: /storage\n    spec:\n      accessModes:\n        - ReadWriteOnce\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 1Gi\nBuilt-in life cycle management\nWe’ve spent years refining the life cycle of a TeamCity server (startup, updates, and clean shutdown) for TeamCity Cloud. The new operator brings these practices to self-hosted users.\nFor upgrades, the TeamCity Operator can perform a quick update with downtime or run an orchestrated, zero-downtime upgrade process, keeping at least one TeamCity node available while switching versions behind the scenes\nThese workflows go far beyond what a Helm chart can reliably encode.\nConfiguration as code with the TeamCity Operator, Terraform, and the Kotlin DSL\nThe TeamCity Operator is focused on life cycle and cluster-level configuration. It gives you a running TeamCity instance but intentionally leaves higher-level configuration to other tools.\nYou can combine it with:\nThe Terraform Provider for TeamCity for managing server-level settings, cleanup rules, VCS roots, project templates, and other global configuration elements.\nThe Kotlin DSL or YAML for per-project build configurations.\nTogether, these create a complete and consistent code-driven setup:\nThe TeamCity Operator installs, scales, upgrades, and tears down TeamCity.\nTerraform configures global server behavior.\nThe Kotlin DSL or YAML defines the builds themselves.\nThis allows you to manage every part of TeamCity with code and keep the configuration fully version-controlled.\nWhy use the TeamCity Operator?\nTo put it simply, the TeamCity Operator offers a hassle-free way to run TeamCity in Kubernetes.\nIt gives you:\nA minimal starting manifest for quick setups.\nAn extended manifest for more advanced installations.\nAn automated life cycle that reduces the risk of misconfiguration.\nConsistent behavior across environments.\nA path toward a fully code-driven, reproducible CI/CD infrastructure.\nIf you’re running TeamCity as part of your CI/CD setup (especially in a Kubernetes-heavy environment), the TeamCity Operator helps take some of the pressure off. It reduces your day-to-day workload and makes long-term maintenance much easier.\nWhat’s next\nWe’re preparing official documentation to accompany the TeamCity Operator. In the meantime, you can explore the GitHub repository, which includes solid documentation in the README.\nFor now, the GitHub repository includes examples and technical notes, and we’ll expand them over time. We also plan to publish migration guides and usage examples, particularly around combining the TeamCity Operator with Terraform and the Kotlin DSL.\nYou’ll also see the TeamCity Operator featured at industry events such as KubeCon, where our engineers will be available to give a walk-through of the design and answer questions.\n👉 Check out the GitHub repository 👈",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is the first guest post in a two-part series from José Luis González. José Luis has a PhD in software development and is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer, who works with developers and engineering teams to deepen their Kotlin skills and apply the language effectively in real projects. At Hyperskill, he runs Kotlin instructor-led training for teams at Hyperskill that focus on advanced topics and practical problem-solving rather than theory.\n1. What are the top 3 Kotlin anti-patterns from self-taught teams, and how do you fix each one?\nThis is a good question. The basic anti-pattern I see in self-taught Kotlin teams is that they still design hierarchies of abstract classes, factories, and deep inheritance trees because that’s how they learned Java. But Kotlin thrives on data-oriented, sealed, and expression-based designs. Overusing inheritance leads to fragile hierarchies, bloated APIs, and code that fights Kotlin’s strengths.\nThe simplest improvement is to flatten your design. Use sealed classes, data classes, and when expressions to model domain state declaratively instead of relying on polymorphism. Prefer composition and smart constructors over inheritance.\nMoving to what’s catching my attention in the last 2 years, I see subtler issues from teams that already “know Kotlin,” but haven’t kept up with how the language evolved. \nA major issue I still see is the use of ambient singletons: things like global object repositories or custom service locators. They make code look simpler at first, but in reality they hide dependencies and make testing much harder. \nContext parameters would fix it: the successor to context receivers, so functions declare the services they need and callers supply them, no globals required:\ninterface Clock { \n  fun now(): Instant\n}\n\ncontext(_: Clock) \nfun stamp() = now()\n\nwith(object: Clock{ override fun now() = Clock.System.now() }) { \n  stamp() \n}\nThis is Beta in Kotlin 2.2 and replaces context receivers with IDE-assisted migration.\nAnother common trap is the illusion of type safety through typealias.\ntypealias UserId = String doesn’t create a new type as it’s only an alias, so UserId and String are fully interchangeable. In 2025, the idiomatic solution is to use value classes (inline classes), which introduce true domain types while remaining allocation-free at runtime.\n@JvmInline \nvalue class UserId(\n  val v: String\n)\n\nfun load(u: UserId) {}\n\n// load(\"abc\")    // not good\n\nload(UserId(\"abc\")) // better\nA more subtle anti-pattern I still see is treating coroutines as ‘threads with nicer syntax.’ The telltale signs are GlobalScope.launch, random runBlocking calls in production, and code that ignores structured concurrency entirely. The modern fix: stop launching in GlobalScope, tie every coroutine to a real scope or lifecycle, keep runBlocking in main() or tests, and use coroutineScope/supervisorScope to compose concurrent work instead of escaping it.\nsuspend fun load() = supervisorScope {\n  val a = async { repo.a() }; \n  val b = async { repo.b() }; \n  a.await() to b.await()\n}\nGlobalScope is a @DelicateCoroutinesApi escape hatch, and official guidance frames runBlocking as a bridge for tests and entry points, not production call paths.\n(Author’s remark: since Kotlin 2.0, K2 is the default compiler across JVM/Native/JS/Wasm: lean on these features confidently in KMP codebases.)\n2. When teams ask you about testing async Kotlin code, what’s the exact testing pattern you show them that works reliably in CI/CD?\n I show them one reliable pattern that scales and never flakes. The key is to inject dispatchers, not hardcode Dispatchers.IO, and test with runTest plus a StandardTestDispatcher (or MainDispatcherRule on Android). This lets you control virtual time deterministically using advanceTimeBy() or advanceUntilIdle(), so no real delays or sleeps are needed. Always assert both results and cancellation: tests should prove that CancellationException propagates and does not get swallowed.\nHere’s the compact pattern:\n@OptIn(ExperimentalCoroutinesApi::class)\n@Test fun flow_is_deterministic() = runTest {\n    val testDispatcher = StandardTestDispatcher(testScheduler)\n    val repo = Repo(svc = FakeSvc(), dispatchers = object : AppDispatchers {\n        override val io = testDispatcher; override val default = testDispatcher\n    })\n\n    val job = launch { assertEquals(\"A\" to \"B\", repo.load()) }\n    advanceUntilIdle()              // run coroutines deterministically\n    assertTrue(job.isCompleted)     // also test job.cancel() + advanceUntilIdle()\n}\nIf you’re testing a Flow, use Turbine instead of assertEquals:\nflow.test {\n    assertEquals(\"A\", awaitItem())\n    cancelAndIgnoreRemainingEvents()\n}\nThis pattern works consistently in CI/CD because it avoids timing flakiness, doesn’t rely on real delays, and enforces proper structured concurrency.\n3. A team just deployed their first Kotlin microservice and it’s using 3x more memory than expected. What’s your diagnostic checklist, and what are the most likely culprits?\nIf a new Kotlin microservice suddenly uses three times more memory than expected, I start by checking whether it’s really a Kotlin issue or just how the JVM behaves under load. The first thing is to see what kind of memory grows.\nIf the heap is flat but RSS keeps rising, it’s usually thread stacks or direct buffers. Each thread costs around 1-2 MB, and Dispatchers.IO can easily spin up hundreds under blocking I/O. Limit it:\n val io = Dispatchers.IO.limitedParallelism(64)\n❗ And make sure you’re not using raw threads where coroutines would do. That’s a common “Java habit” that quietly kills memory efficiency.\nNext, if the heap itself grows, look for unbounded coroutines or collections: things like Channel.UNLIMITED, flow.buffer() without limits, or caches that never evict. Backpressure fixes most of these:\nflow.buffer(256, onBufferOverflow = BufferOverflow.DROP_OLDEST)\nThen check the HTTP layer. Frameworks like Ktor with CIO or Netty may buffer entire requests in memory. Stream instead of aggregating:\ncall.receiveChannel().copyTo(File(\"upload.bin\").outputStream())\nOn the JVM side, always set explicit container limits so it doesn’t grab all available RAM:\n-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=60 -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=128m -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=128m\nFinally, profile before guessing. I usually attach an async-profiler or JDK Flight Recorder to see where allocations come from, and combine that with jcmd VM.native_memory summary for off-heap diagnostics.\nIn short: use real coroutines, not threads; set memory caps; limit dispatcher parallelism; bound every buffer; and verify with profiling. That’s how you fix 90 % of “why is our Kotlin service eating all the RAM?” cases.\nJosé Luis González\nJosé Luis González, PhD, is a JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer who teaches Kotlin and advanced techniques to development teams.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "You’re a .NET developer with a busy morning, and an Azure DevOps ticket drops: “Login endpoint 500s under load.” You’ve got to fix it, review a teammate’s feature branch, and keep your repo clean – all before lunch. Visual Studio’s Git tools turn this everyday Git workflow of creating topic branches, stashing changes, committing, and handling PRs into a smooth, fast process.\nLet’s walk through your morning, showing how Visual Studio keeps Git friction out of your way.\n9:00 AM: Spin up a topic branch for your bug fix\nYour repo’s open in VS (View → Git Repository), and you’re on main, fresh from last night’s CI run. To keep your bug-fix isolated, you right-click main in the Git Repository Window, select New Local Branch From, and name it fix/auth-race-1, linking it to your DevOps ticket. You’re switched to the new branch instantly, and the 2026 Git status bar shows your branch and sync status, so you’re never lost.\n\nYou update AuthService.cs with an async lock to fix the race condition.\nA Slack ping from the PM interrupts: they need you to review a feature branch for a demo. Time to pause your work without losing it.\n9:30 AM: Stash changes to juggle tasks\nYou’re mid-fix with unsaved changes, not ready to commit. In the Git Changes Window (View → Git Changes), you select your modified files, click Stash All, and add a note: “WIP: Auth fix before demo.” Visual Studio shelves everything, leaving your directory clean.\n\nBranch switching in Visual Studio is a lot faster now thanks to optimized solution load and indexing. You polish the feature and push it to remote, all while your bug fix stays safely stashed.\nWith the feature review done, you’re ready to return to your bug fix and polish it before committing.\n10:15 AM: Pop stash and review code\nYou switch back to fix/auth-race-1, and Visual Studio’s fast branch switching keeps you moving. To restore your work, go to Git Changes Window, hit the Stash tab, right-click, and select Pop Stash. Your changes come back seamlessly.\nBefore committing, you want to catch any slip-ups. In Git Changes Window, click the Copilot Code Review button. Copilot scans your diff and leaves a few comments in the editor. You apply the suggestions with one click.\n\nFor extra confidence, open Copilot Chat (View → Copilot Chat), type “#changes Check security,” and get: “Add rate limiting for brute-force protection.” You tweak the code, catching more issues early, which makes your eventual PR cleaner.\nWith your code polished, you’re ready to commit your changes.\n10:45 AM: Time to commit\nYour code’s solid, so it’s time to commit. In the Git Changes Window, click the Generate Commit Message button. It’s formatted to your team’s standard (learn how to set that up in an earlier blog post), tied to DevOps, and saves you a minute. Push your changes with a click, keeping your history clean and team friendly.\n\nNow it’s time to share this with your team.\n11:15 AM: Create PR and review inline\nYour work is now ready for a review! Upon pushing, you get a banner in the Git Changes window and click the link to create a pull request. (Alternatively, you can also go to Git Repository Window and right-click fix/auth-race-1 → Create Pull Request.) In the PR creation UI, select your lead, Sarah, and another teammate, Mike, as reviewers by clicking the Add Reviewers field and choosing their names from the dropdown. Since there’s just one commit, VS automatically pulls Copilot’s commit message into the Azure DevOps PR description. You could also generate a PR description to ensure it matches your team’s standards. Click Create, and it’s up for review.\n\nSarah can easily review the PR right in Visual Studio, finding it assigned to her in the Git Repository Window.\n\nShe opens the PR and adds comments directly inside Visual Studio. The Markdown renders right in the diff, threaded and clear. No browser tabs needed!\n\nYou reply inline, make updates, and push your new changes. Visual Studio syncs the diff instantly. Reviews feel less cluttered, and Sarah and Mike approve. You merge to main and delete the branch to keep the repo clean.\nWrap-up: Git that flows\nVisual Studio’s Git tools – fast branch switches, visual diffs, Copilot commits, AI reviews, inline comments – save you time in your daily grind. Branching, stashing, and PRs are smoother than ever before, letting you focus on code. The AI review before committing catches mistakes early, setting your PRs up for success.\nTry it out and let us know what other Git topics you want to know more about in the comments below.\nHappy coding!\n \n \n \n \nThe post Streamlining your Git workflow with Visual Studio 2026 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "AI와의 소통 방식이 진화하고 있습니다. 영어 프롬프트도 좋지만, 마크다운 문법을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 정확하고 원하는 형식으로 답변하게 만들 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 효율적인 AI 활용을 위한 마크다운 프롬프트의 모든 것을 친근하고 실용적인 예시와 함께 알려드릴게요!\n  AI와 더 똑똑하게 대화하는 비법, 왜 마크다운일까요?\n\n\n  AI는 우리 일상과 업무에 깊숙이 스며들었어요. 다들 챗GPT 같은 인공지능 도구들과 한 번쯤은 대화해보셨을 텐데요. 그런데 혹시 이런 경험 없으신가요? 꽤 긴 프롬프트를 입력했는데, AI가 엉뚱한 방향으로 답변하거나, 아니면 제가 원하는 형식과는 전혀 다른 결과물을 내놓을 때 말이에요. 정말이지 답답할 때가 한두 번이 아니었죠. 제 경험상 처음엔 단순히 영어로 프롬프트를 길게, 자세하게 쓰면 되는 줄 알았어요. 하지만 시간이 지날수록 무언가 더 중요한 것이 있다는 걸 깨닫게 되더라고요.\n사실, AI와 효과적으로 소통하는 데에는 언어 선택만큼이나 '구조'가 중요해요. AI는 우리가 던지는 문장들을 분석해서 의미를 파악하지만, 그 의미가 어떤 '형식'으로 이루어져야 하는지는 명확히 알려주지 않으면 헤맬 때가 많거든요. 이때 빛을 발하는 것이 바로 마크다운 문법입니다. 마치 설계도면처럼 AI에게 정확한 구조를 제시해서, 우리가 원하는 대로 정보를 구성하고 답변하게 만드는 거죠.\n  마크다운, AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'인 이유\n제가 왜 마크다운을 AI 대화의 '게임 체인저'라고 부르는지 궁금하시죠? 몇 가지 핵심적인 이유가 있어요. 단순히 영어를 잘 쓰는 것을 넘어서, 마크다운을 활용하면 AI가 훨씬 더 똑똑해지고, 여러분의 작업 효율은 비약적으로 상승합니다.\n명확한 구조 전달: 마크다운은 헤더, 목록, 코드 블록, 표 등 정해진 문법으로 텍스트의 구조를 명확하게 정의할 수 있어요. AI는 이 구조를 보고 여러분이 원하는 답변의 형태를 정확하게 파악하게 됩니다.\n정보 손실 최소화: 모호하거나 중의적인 표현을 줄이고, 정보의 계층을 분명히 함으로써 AI가 프롬프트를 오해할 가능성을 현저히 낮춥니다.\n일관된 출력: 한 번 마크다운 문법으로 형식을 지정해두면, AI는 항상 그 형식에 맞춰 답변을 생성합니다. 반복적인 작업을 할 때, 수동으로 편집하는 시간을 크게 절약할 수 있어요.\n효율적인 작업: 특히 보고서 초안, 코드 스니펫 요청, 자료 요약 등 구조화된 정보가 필요한 경우, 마크다운은 개발자, 작가, 기획자 등 모든 직군에서 생산성을 폭발적으로 높여줍니다.\n  팁: 마크다운은 복잡한 프로그래밍 언어가 아니에요! 몇 가지 규칙만 알면 누구나 쉽게 활용할 수 있답니다. HTML처럼 복잡한 태그를 외울 필요도 없어서 정말 간편하죠.\n  초보자도 쉽게 따라 하는 마크다운 프롬프트 작성법\n그럼 이제 실전으로 들어가 볼까요? 마크다운 문법, 생각보다 정말 쉬워요. 몇 가지만 기억하면 됩니다. 제가 가장 많이 사용하는 핵심 문법들을 소개해 드릴게요.\n1. 헤더 (제목)\n문서의 제목이나 소제목을 만들 때 사용해요. `#`의 개수로 크기를 조절합니다.\n# 대제목\n## 중제목\n### 소제목\n2. 목록 (리스트)\n순서가 없는 목록은 `-`나 `*`로, 순서 있는 목록은 숫자로 시작합니다. 들여쓰기로 하위 목록을 만들 수 있어요.\n- 첫 번째 항목\n* 두 번째 항목\n1. 순서 있는 첫 번째\n  2. 하위 항목\n3. 코드 블록\n코드나 특정 텍스트를 강조하고 싶을 때 사용해요. 백틱(`) 세 개로 감싸면 됩니다.\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, AI!\")\n```\n4. 굵게/기울게\n텍스트를 굵게 하려면 `**`로, 기울게 하려면 `*`로 감싸세요.\n**굵은 글씨** -> 굵은 글씨\n*기울인 글씨* -> 기울인 글씨\n5. 표 (Table)\n데이터를 구조적으로 표현하는 데 유용해요. 생각보다 어렵지 않습니다!\n문법\n설명\n예시\n\n\n\n\n#\n헤더(제목)\n# 메인 제목\n\n\n- / *\n순서 없는 목록\n- 항목 1\n\n\n1.\n순서 있는 목록\n1. 첫째\n\n\n```\n코드 블록\n```코드```\n\n\n** / *\n굵게 / 기울게\n**강조**\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의: 지나치게 복잡한 마크다운은 오히려 AI를 혼란스럽게 할 수 있어요. 핵심적인 구조 위주로 간단하게 사용하는 것이 중요합니다. 너무 많은 문법을 한 번에 쓰려고 하지 마세요!\n  실제 사례로 보는 마크다운 프롬프트의 위력\n이론만으로는 와닿지 않으실 수도 있어요. 그래서 제가 직접 AI에게 마크다운 문법을 활용해서 프롬프트를 작성해본 몇 가지 사례를 보여드릴까 해요. 정말 놀라울 정도로 결과물의 질이 달라지는 걸 체감하실 겁니다.\n사례 1: 보고서 초안 작성 요청\n단순히 \"AI 기술 동향에 대한 보고서 초안을 써줘\"라고 요청했을 때와, 아래처럼 마크다운으로 구조를 명확히 제시했을 때의 결과는 하늘과 땅 차이였습니다.

FOMO는 'Fear Of Missing Out'의 약자로, \"나만 뒤처지는 것 같은 불안감\"을 의미해요. 2025년 현재, 뉴스나 유튜브, 심지어 회사에서도 AI 얘기가 끊이지 않죠. 주변에서 다들 챗GPT를 쓴다는데 나만 못하는 것 같아 조급하고 불안한 마음, 솔직히 저도 느껴봤습니다. 하지만 괜찮습니다. 지금 시작하는 것만으로도 충분히 빠르다고 생각해요. \"빨리 배워야 하는데...\" 하는 조급함이 오히려 제대로 배우는 것을 방해할 수 있으니, 차분하게 시작하는 것이 중요합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">두 번째 이유는 바로 <b>어려운 용어의 장벽</b>입니다. AI, LLM, 프롬프트, 토큰, 멀티모달... 이런 단어들을 들으면 마치 외계어처럼 느껴져 머리가 지끈거릴 수 있습니다. 솔직히 말하면 저도 처음에는 'LLM? 엘엘엠? 래퍼 이름인가?' 하고 생각했던 기억이 나네요. 이 용어의 장벽만 넘어서면 AI는 훨씬 쉬워진답니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">세 번째는 <b>어디서부터 시작해야 할지 모른다는 막막함</b>입니다. 챗GPT, 클로드, 제미나이 등 종류가 너무 많아서 뭘 써야 할지 감이 안 잡히실 거예요. 마치 맛있는 치킨집이 너무 많아서 어디에 시켜야 할지 고민되는 것과 비슷하다고 할까요?</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">마지막 네 번째는 <b>질문을 어떻게 해야 할지 모른다는 점</b>입니다. AI에게 \"글 써줘\"라고만 하면 엉뚱한 답이 나오기 일쑤죠. 답답한 마음에 \"너 왜 이래?\" 하고 AI에게 화를 내봤자, AI는 감정이 없으니 계속 이상한 답만 내놓을 뿐입니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; color: #3c4043;\">  <b>이 포스트가 여러분의 불안감을 해소해 드립니다!</b> 오늘 'AI 필수 용어 완벽 가이드'를 통해 어려운 용어들을 일상 언어로 쉽게 풀어 설명해드릴게요. 용어만 알아도 AI 정복의 절반은 이뤄냈다고 볼 수 있습니다!</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  AI 왕초보를 위한 핵심 용어 16가지 완벽 정리!</b></h2>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>1. AI (Artificial Intelligence): 인공지능</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">가장 먼저, <b>AI</b>는 쉽게 말해 <b>사람처럼 생각하고 대답할 수 있는 컴퓨터 프로그램</b>입니다. 마치 똑똑한 비서를 컴퓨터 안에 넣어둔 것과 같다고 생각하시면 돼요. 그것도 24시간 내내 일하고, 월급도 휴가도 필요 없는 완벽한 비서죠. 물론 가끔 엉뚱한 소리도 하긴 하지만 말입니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>2. LLM (Large Language Model): 대규모 언어 모델</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>LLM</b>은 한국어로 <b>대규모 언어 모델</b>이라고 부릅니다. 이건 쉽게 설명하자면, <b>엄청나게 많은 책과 인터넷 글을 읽고 학습한 AI</b>를 뜻해요. 'AI'가 '과일'이라는 큰 개념이라면, 'LLM'은 그 안의 '사과'처럼 언어에 특화된 특정 AI를 지칭합니다. 우리가 흔히 아는 챗GPT, 클로드, 제미나이가 바로 이 LLM에 속하죠. 마치 지구상의 모든 도서관 책을 다 읽어버린 초특급 독서광 AI라고 생각하시면 됩니다. 여기서 중요한 점은 LLM이 단순히 저장된 답변을 보여주는 게 아니라, 여러분의 질문을 이해하고 새로운 답변을 스스로 만들어낸다는 거예요. 네이버 지식인처럼 누가 써놓은 답을 복사 붙여넣기 하는 것이 아니라, 실시간으로 생각해서 답을 만들어내는 거죠!</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>3. SLM (Small Language Model): 소형 언어 모델</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">LLM이 대형 트럭이라면, <b>SLM</b>은 <b>경차</b>에 비유할 수 있습니다. 작지만 가볍고 빠르다는 장점이 있죠. SLM은 LLM과 똑같은 방식으로 작동하지만, 크기를 확 줄인 모델이에요. 파라미터 수를 줄이거나 모델 압축 기술을 사용해서 효율성을 높입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">가장 큰 차이는 <b>작동 위치</b>에 있습니다. 일반적인 LLM은 여러분이 질문하면 인터넷을 통해 멀리 떨어진 서버로 보내져 처리되고 답변이 돌아오죠. 마치 해외 본사에 전화해서 답변받는 것처럼 인터넷 연결이 필수예요. 하지만 SLM은 <b>여러분의 PC에 직접 설치되어 작동</b>합니다. 질문하면 컴퓨터의 CPU나 그래픽카드가 바로 처리해서 답변을 주기 때문에 인터넷 없이도 작동하고, 개인 정보가 외부로 나가지 않아 보안에도 강하죠. 물론 성능은 LLM보다 낮지만, 문서 요약, 간단한 번역, 메모 정리 같은 일상적인 작업에는 충분하고, 무엇보다 <b>무료로 사용할 수 있다</b>는 큰 장점이 있습니다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cMJu2M/dJMcafE6lpU/2kkldV8jnIIJGlAEKvhQOK/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cMJu2M/dJMcafE6lpU/2kkldV8jnIIJGlAEKvhQOK/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cMJu2M/dJMcafE6lpU/2kkldV8jnIIJGlAEKvhQOK/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FcMJu2M%2FdJMcafE6lpU%2F2kkldV8jnIIJGlAEKvhQOK%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"LLM의 클라우드 기반 대규모 처리와 SLM의 개인 PC 기반 로컬 처리 방식을 시각적으로 비교하는 인포그래픽.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>4. 챗봇 &amp; GPTs/Gems &amp; Projects: AI 활용의 두 가지 방식</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>챗봇</b>은 채팅하듯이 대화할 수 있는 AI 프로그램입니다. 챗GPT의 '챗'이 바로 이 챗봇을 의미하죠. 그런데 여기서 <b>맞춤형 챗봇(GPTs/Gems)</b>과 <b>프로젝트 기능</b>이라는 두 가지 중요한 개념을 구분해야 해요. 둘 다 AI를 내 방식대로 쓰는 것이지만, 목적이 완전히 다릅니다. 쉽게 말해 \"너 누구야?\"라고 묻는 것과 \"이 일에 대해 어떻게 생각해?\"라고 묻는 것의 차이랄까요?</p>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 17px; color: #004d99; margin: 15px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size20\"><b>✅ GPTs와 Gems: 나만의 전문 AI 비서 만들기 (누구냐?)</b></h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>GPTs</b>는 챗GPT에서 제공하는 맞춤형 챗봇 만들기 기능이에요. 'G'는 GPT의 G, 's'는 복수형을 의미합니다. 여러 개 만들 수 있다는 뜻이죠. 이건 특정 역할을 하는 전문 AI를 만드는 겁니다. 마치 전문 직업을 가진 직원을 여러 명 고용하는 것처럼요. 예를 들어, \"너는 세계 최고의 요리 전문가야\"라고 역할을 정의하고 상세 지침을 제공하면, 이후에 \"파스타 소스 비법 알려줘!\"라고 물을 때 요리 전문가답게 답변하는 식입니다. 한 번 만들어두면 매번 설명할 필요 없이 그 역할로 계속 작동하죠. 구글 제미나이에서 제공하는 <b>Gems</b>도 이름만 다를 뿐 완전히 동일한 개념이에요.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0; color: #3c4043;\">  <b>예시:</b> 요리 전문가 GPT, 번역 전문가 GPT, 법률 상담 GPT 등 나만의 전문가 팀을 만들 수 있어요.</div>\n<h4 style=\"font-size: 17px; color: #004d99; margin: 15px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size20\"><b>✅ Projects: 작업 단위로 대화와 파일 관리하기 (무엇을 하느냐?)</b></h4>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>프로젝트</b>는 작업 단위로 대화와 파일을 묶어서 관리하는 기능입니다. 회사에서 A 프로젝트와 B 프로젝트를 동시에 진행한다고 할 때, A 프로젝트 관련 대화, 문서, 자료를 한곳에 모아두고, B 프로젝트 것들은 따로 모아두는 식이죠. 마치 프로젝트별로 폴더를 만드는 것과 같아요. 프로젝트의 핵심은 바로 <b>'맥락 유지'</b>입니다. \"마케팅 프로젝트\" 폴더 안에서 대화하면 AI가 그 프로젝트의 모든 이전 대화와 파일을 기억해요. 어제 업로드한 시장 분석 보고서 PDF를 기억해서, 오늘 같은 폴더에서 \"어제 올린 자료 기반으로 요약해줘\"라고만 해도 AI가 알아서 찾아 요약해줍니다. 챗GPT Projects와 클로드 Projects도 동일한 기능입니다.</p>\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 25px 0; font-size: 15px;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #e8eaed; text-align: center; color: #3c4043;\">구분</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #e8eaed; text-align: center; color: #3c4043;\">GPTs / Gems</th>\n<th style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #e8eaed; text-align: center; color: #3c4043;\">Projects</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\"><b>목적</b></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\">특정 역할 수행 AI 제작</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\">특정 작업의 대화/파일 통합 관리</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f3f4; color: #3c4043;\"><b>지속성</b></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f3f4; color: #3c4043;\">한 번 만든 역할이 모든 대화에서 유지</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f1f3f4; color: #3c4043;\">해당 프로젝트 내에서만 맥락 유지</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\"><b>핵심</b></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\">AI의 '정체성' 정의</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dadce0; padding: 12px; background-color: #f8f9fa; color: #3c4043;\">작업의 '맥락' 보존</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>5. 토큰 (Token): AI 언어 처리의 기본 단위</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>토큰</b>은 <b>AI가 글자를 처리할 때 사용하는 기본 단위</b>입니다. 레고 블록을 생각해보세요. 긴 문장을 작은 조각으로 쪼개서 이해하는데, 그 조각 하나가 바로 토큰인 거죠. 왜 중요하냐고요? AI 사용량이 이 토큰 단위로 제한되기 때문입니다. 무료 버전은 하루에 몇 천 토큰까지 쓸 수 있다, 이런 식이에요. 마치 핸드폰 데이터 요금처럼 말이죠. 그래서 너무 긴 질문이나 답변은 토큰을 많이 소모한다는 것만 기억하시면 됩니다. 보통 한국어 글자 한 자가 토큰 한 개 정도라고 보시면 편해요. 하지만 '안녕하세요'처럼 자주 쓰는 말은 AI가 통째로 기억해서 1~2개 토큰으로 아주 싸게 처리하니, 토큰 걱정 너무 하지 말고 편하게 쓰셔도 좋습니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin: 25px 0 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>6. 컨텍스트 (Context): AI의 대화 기억력</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>컨텍스트</b>는 <b>AI가 대화의 흐름을 기억하는 능력</b>을 말합니다. 예를 들어, 여러분이 \"사과에 대해 알려줘\"라고 물어 AI가 과일 사과를 설명했어요. 그다음에 \"가격은?\"이라고만 물어봐도 AI는 \"아, 사과 가격을 묻는구나\" 하고 알아듣죠. 이게 바로 컨텍스트를 이해한다는 겁니다. 마치 친구와 대화할 때 앞뒤 맥락을 다 기억하고 있는 것처럼요. AI마다 기억할 수 있는 대화의 길이가 다른데, 클로드나 제미나이 같은 모델은 특히 긴 대화를 잘 기억하는 편입니다. 마치 토씨 하나 안 틀리는 꼼꼼한 비서 같달까요? 하지만 대화가 너무 길어져서 AI의 '기억 용량'이 꽉 차면 이전 기억을 지울 수도 있어요. 이럴 땐 처음부터 다시 설명해주는 것이 가장 정확합니다.

        "contentSnippet": "\"나만 AI 몰라?\"라는 생각에 불안하신가요? LLM, 할루시네이션, 프롬프트... 복잡한 용어들 때문에 AI 시작이 두렵다면 이 가이드를 주목하세요. 왕초보도 30분 만에 AI 핵심 용어를 완벽하게 이해하고 디지털 포모(FOMO)를 극복할 수 있도록, 지피티팍이 쉽고 친절하게 설명해드립니다. 지금 바로 AI 세상으로 함께 떠나보시죠!\n\"나만 AI 몰라?\" 이런 불안감에 잠 못 이루는 분들이 많으실 거예요. 주변에서는 다들 챗GPT다, 제미나이다 하는데, 막상 시작하려니 LLM은 뭐고, 토큰은 또 뭔지... 용어의 벽에 부딪혀 막막함을 느끼실 수 있습니다. 솔직히 저도 처음엔 그랬어요. 특히 AI가 낯선 초보자분들, 그리고 컴퓨터 사용이 익숙지 않은 시니어분들이라면 더욱 어렵게 느껴질 수 있죠.\n하지만 괜찮습니다! 오늘 딱 30분만 투자하면 AI가 완전히 다르게 보일 거예요. 이 블로그 포스트는 바로 여러분을 위해 준비했어요. 나이나 컴퓨터 실력은 전혀 상관없습니다. 제가 여러분의 눈높이에 맞춰 가장 쉬운 말로만 설명해드릴 테니, 편안하게 따라오세요.\n\n\n \n  AI, 왜 시작이 어려울까요? 2025년 디지털 포모(FOMO)의 그림자\n많은 분들이 AI를 시작하기 어려워하는 데는 몇 가지 이유가 있습니다. 특히 컴퓨터에 익숙하지 않은 분들은 더욱 크게 공감하실 텐데요.\n첫 번째 이유는 바로 디지털 포모(Digital FOMO) 때문입니다. FOMO는 'Fear Of Missing Out'의 약자로, \"나만 뒤처지는 것 같은 불안감\"을 의미해요. 2025년 현재, 뉴스나 유튜브, 심지어 회사에서도 AI 얘기가 끊이지 않죠. 주변에서 다들 챗GPT를 쓴다는데 나만 못하는 것 같아 조급하고 불안한 마음, 솔직히 저도 느껴봤습니다. 하지만 괜찮습니다. 지금 시작하는 것만으로도 충분히 빠르다고 생각해요. \"빨리 배워야 하는데...\" 하는 조급함이 오히려 제대로 배우는 것을 방해할 수 있으니, 차분하게 시작하는 것이 중요합니다.\n두 번째 이유는 바로 어려운 용어의 장벽입니다. AI, LLM, 프롬프트, 토큰, 멀티모달... 이런 단어들을 들으면 마치 외계어처럼 느껴져 머리가 지끈거릴 수 있습니다. 솔직히 말하면 저도 처음에는 'LLM? 엘엘엠? 래퍼 이름인가?' 하고 생각했던 기억이 나네요. 이 용어의 장벽만 넘어서면 AI는 훨씬 쉬워진답니다.\n세 번째는 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 모른다는 막막함입니다. 챗GPT, 클로드, 제미나이 등 종류가 너무 많아서 뭘 써야 할지 감이 안 잡히실 거예요. 마치 맛있는 치킨집이 너무 많아서 어디에 시켜야 할지 고민되는 것과 비슷하다고 할까요?\n마지막 네 번째는 질문을 어떻게 해야 할지 모른다는 점입니다. AI에게 \"글 써줘\"라고만 하면 엉뚱한 답이 나오기 일쑤죠. 답답한 마음에 \"너 왜 이래?\" 하고 AI에게 화를 내봤자, AI는 감정이 없으니 계속 이상한 답만 내놓을 뿐입니다.\n  이 포스트가 여러분의 불안감을 해소해 드립니다! 오늘 'AI 필수 용어 완벽 가이드'를 통해 어려운 용어들을 일상 언어로 쉽게 풀어 설명해드릴게요. 용어만 알아도 AI 정복의 절반은 이뤄냈다고 볼 수 있습니다!\n  AI 왕초보를 위한 핵심 용어 16가지 완벽 정리!\n1. AI (Artificial Intelligence): 인공지능\n가장 먼저, AI는 쉽게 말해 사람처럼 생각하고 대답할 수 있는 컴퓨터 프로그램입니다. 마치 똑똑한 비서를 컴퓨터 안에 넣어둔 것과 같다고 생각하시면 돼요. 그것도 24시간 내내 일하고, 월급도 휴가도 필요 없는 완벽한 비서죠. 물론 가끔 엉뚱한 소리도 하긴 하지만 말입니다.\n2. LLM (Large Language Model): 대규모 언어 모델\nLLM은 한국어로 대규모 언어 모델이라고 부릅니다. 이건 쉽게 설명하자면, 엄청나게 많은 책과 인터넷 글을 읽고 학습한 AI를 뜻해요. 'AI'가 '과일'이라는 큰 개념이라면, 'LLM'은 그 안의 '사과'처럼 언어에 특화된 특정 AI를 지칭합니다. 우리가 흔히 아는 챗GPT, 클로드, 제미나이가 바로 이 LLM에 속하죠. 마치 지구상의 모든 도서관 책을 다 읽어버린 초특급 독서광 AI라고 생각하시면 됩니다. 여기서 중요한 점은 LLM이 단순히 저장된 답변을 보여주는 게 아니라, 여러분의 질문을 이해하고 새로운 답변을 스스로 만들어낸다는 거예요. 네이버 지식인처럼 누가 써놓은 답을 복사 붙여넣기 하는 것이 아니라, 실시간으로 생각해서 답을 만들어내는 거죠!\n3. SLM (Small Language Model): 소형 언어 모델\nLLM이 대형 트럭이라면, SLM은 경차에 비유할 수 있습니다. 작지만 가볍고 빠르다는 장점이 있죠. SLM은 LLM과 똑같은 방식으로 작동하지만, 크기를 확 줄인 모델이에요. 파라미터 수를 줄이거나 모델 압축 기술을 사용해서 효율성을 높입니다.\n가장 큰 차이는 작동 위치에 있습니다. 일반적인 LLM은 여러분이 질문하면 인터넷을 통해 멀리 떨어진 서버로 보내져 처리되고 답변이 돌아오죠. 마치 해외 본사에 전화해서 답변받는 것처럼 인터넷 연결이 필수예요. 하지만 SLM은 여러분의 PC에 직접 설치되어 작동합니다. 질문하면 컴퓨터의 CPU나 그래픽카드가 바로 처리해서 답변을 주기 때문에 인터넷 없이도 작동하고, 개인 정보가 외부로 나가지 않아 보안에도 강하죠. 물론 성능은 LLM보다 낮지만, 문서 요약, 간단한 번역, 메모 정리 같은 일상적인 작업에는 충분하고, 무엇보다 무료로 사용할 수 있다는 큰 장점이 있습니다.\n\n\n4. 챗봇 & GPTs/Gems & Projects: AI 활용의 두 가지 방식\n챗봇은 채팅하듯이 대화할 수 있는 AI 프로그램입니다. 챗GPT의 '챗'이 바로 이 챗봇을 의미하죠. 그런데 여기서 맞춤형 챗봇(GPTs/Gems)과 프로젝트 기능이라는 두 가지 중요한 개념을 구분해야 해요. 둘 다 AI를 내 방식대로 쓰는 것이지만, 목적이 완전히 다릅니다. 쉽게 말해 \"너 누구야?\"라고 묻는 것과 \"이 일에 대해 어떻게 생각해?\"라고 묻는 것의 차이랄까요?\n✅ GPTs와 Gems: 나만의 전문 AI 비서 만들기 (누구냐?)\nGPTs는 챗GPT에서 제공하는 맞춤형 챗봇 만들기 기능이에요. 'G'는 GPT의 G, 's'는 복수형을 의미합니다. 여러 개 만들 수 있다는 뜻이죠. 이건 특정 역할을 하는 전문 AI를 만드는 겁니다. 마치 전문 직업을 가진 직원을 여러 명 고용하는 것처럼요. 예를 들어, \"너는 세계 최고의 요리 전문가야\"라고 역할을 정의하고 상세 지침을 제공하면, 이후에 \"파스타 소스 비법 알려줘!\"라고 물을 때 요리 전문가답게 답변하는 식입니다. 한 번 만들어두면 매번 설명할 필요 없이 그 역할로 계속 작동하죠. 구글 제미나이에서 제공하는 Gems도 이름만 다를 뿐 완전히 동일한 개념이에요.\n  예시: 요리 전문가 GPT, 번역 전문가 GPT, 법률 상담 GPT 등 나만의 전문가 팀을 만들 수 있어요.\n✅ Projects: 작업 단위로 대화와 파일 관리하기 (무엇을 하느냐?)\n프로젝트는 작업 단위로 대화와 파일을 묶어서 관리하는 기능입니다. 회사에서 A 프로젝트와 B 프로젝트를 동시에 진행한다고 할 때, A 프로젝트 관련 대화, 문서, 자료를 한곳에 모아두고, B 프로젝트 것들은 따로 모아두는 식이죠. 마치 프로젝트별로 폴더를 만드는 것과 같아요. 프로젝트의 핵심은 바로 '맥락 유지'입니다. \"마케팅 프로젝트\" 폴더 안에서 대화하면 AI가 그 프로젝트의 모든 이전 대화와 파일을 기억해요. 어제 업로드한 시장 분석 보고서 PDF를 기억해서, 오늘 같은 폴더에서 \"어제 올린 자료 기반으로 요약해줘\"라고만 해도 AI가 알아서 찾아 요약해줍니다. 챗GPT Projects와 클로드 Projects도 동일한 기능입니다.\n구분\nGPTs / Gems\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n목적\n특정 역할 수행 AI 제작\n특정 작업의 대화/파일 통합 관리\n\n\n지속성\n한 번 만든 역할이 모든 대화에서 유지\n해당 프로젝트 내에서만 맥락 유지\n\n\n핵심\nAI의 '정체성' 정의\n작업의 '맥락' 보존\n\n\n\n5. 토큰 (Token): AI 언어 처리의 기본 단위\n토큰은 AI가 글자를 처리할 때 사용하는 기본 단위입니다. 레고 블록을 생각해보세요. 긴 문장을 작은 조각으로 쪼개서 이해하는데, 그 조각 하나가 바로 토큰인 거죠. 왜 중요하냐고요? AI 사용량이 이 토큰 단위로 제한되기 때문입니다. 무료 버전은 하루에 몇 천 토큰까지 쓸 수 있다, 이런 식이에요. 마치 핸드폰 데이터 요금처럼 말이죠. 그래서 너무 긴 질문이나 답변은 토큰을 많이 소모한다는 것만 기억하시면 됩니다. 보통 한국어 글자 한 자가 토큰 한 개 정도라고 보시면 편해요. 하지만 '안녕하세요'처럼 자주 쓰는 말은 AI가 통째로 기억해서 1~2개 토큰으로 아주 싸게 처리하니, 토큰 걱정 너무 하지 말고 편하게 쓰셔도 좋습니다.\n6. 컨텍스트 (Context): AI의 대화 기억력\n컨텍스트는 AI가 대화의 흐름을 기억하는 능력을 말합니다. 예를 들어, 여러분이 \"사과에 대해 알려줘\"라고 물어 AI가 과일 사과를 설명했어요. 그다음에 \"가격은?\"이라고만 물어봐도 AI는 \"아, 사과 가격을 묻는구나\" 하고 알아듣죠. 이게 바로 컨텍스트를 이해한다는 겁니다. 마치 친구와 대화할 때 앞뒤 맥락을 다 기억하고 있는 것처럼요. AI마다 기억할 수 있는 대화의 길이가 다른데, 클로드나 제미나이 같은 모델은 특히 긴 대화를 잘 기억하는 편입니다. 마치 토씨 하나 안 틀리는 꼼꼼한 비서 같달까요? 하지만 대화가 너무 길어져서 AI의 '기억 용량'이 꽉 차면 이전 기억을 지울 수도 있어요. 이럴 땐 처음부터 다시 설명해주는 것이 가장 정확합니다. AI도 가끔 건망증이 있답니다.\n7. 지식 단절 시점 (Knowledge Cutoff Date): AI의 시공간 제약\n이건 정말 중요해요! 지식 단절 시점은 AI가 특정 날짜까지의 정보만 알고 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 그 이후의 정보는 모르는 거죠. 예를 들어, 챗GPT가 2024년 10월까지 학습했다면, 2024년 11월 이후의 일은 전혀 모릅니다. 마치 타임캡슐에 갇혀 2024년 10월에 잠들었다가 지금 깨어난 사람이라고 생각하시면 됩니다. 그래서 \"어제 뉴스\"나 \"지금 주식 시장 상황\"을 물어보면 AI는 모른다고 답할 수밖에 없어요. 이럴 때는 웹 검색 기능이 있는 AI를 사용하거나, \"웹 검색해서 알려줘\"라고 명확하게 요청해야 합니다. AI가 \"그 정보는 모릅니다\"라고 하면 화내지 마세요. 정말로 모르는 겁니다. 학습 데이터에 없으니까요!\n\n\n8. 멀티모달 (Multimodal): 오감으로 소통하는 AI\n멀티모달은 AI가 글자뿐만 아니라 사진, 음성, 영상 등 다양한 형식의 정보도 이해할 수 있다는 뜻입니다. 예전 AI는 글로만 대화했지만, 이제는 사진을 올리면 설명해주고, 음성으로 질문하면 음성으로 답하며, 영상도 분석할 수 있어요. 마치 오감이 다 있는 사람처럼 보고, 듣고, 말할 수 있는 AI가 된 거죠. 이제는 \"이게 뭐야?\" 하면서 사진만 찍어 올려도 알아서 설명해줍니다. 저는 가끔 냉장고 사진 찍어서 \"오늘 저녁 뭐 해먹지?\" 하고 물어보는데 정말 편하답니다!\nAI에 올릴 수 있는 파일들은 정말 다양해요. 파일 이름 끝에 붙는 몇 글자, 즉 확장자가 그 파일이 어떤 종류인지 알려주는 역할을 합니다. 마치 사람의 성씨처럼 파일을 구분하는 거죠.\n문서 파일: PDF (계약서, 보고서 요약), TXT (순수 텍스트), CSV (표 형태 데이터 분석), DOCX (워드 문서), MD (마크다운)\n이미지 파일: JPG/JPEG (사진), PNG (투명 배경), GIF (움직이는 이미지), WebP (고화질 경량 이미지)\n오디오 파일: MP3 (음악, 회의 녹음 텍스트 변환), WAV (고음질 오디오), M4A (애플 기기 오디오)\n비디오 파일: MP4 (가장 흔한 동영상), MOV (아이폰 동영상), AVI (옛날 동영상), WebM (웹 동영상)\n프로그래밍 소스 파일: PY (파이썬), JS (자바스크립트), HTML (웹페이지 코드)\n이런 파일들을 AI에게 올리고 \"이 코드가 무슨 일을 하는지 설명해줘\"라고 묻는 등, 프로그래밍을 모르는 분들도 AI의 도움을 받아 복잡한 코드를 쉽게 이해할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n9. API (Application Programming Interface): 프로그램들의 대화 통로\nAPI는 프로그램들이 서로 대화하는 통로를 말합니다. 쉽게 말해 AI를 다른 앱이나 웹사이트에 연결하는 방법이에요. 여러분이 사용하는 어떤 앱에서 \"AI로 답장 작성\" 버튼을 누르면, 그 앱이 챗GPT API를 사용해서 챗GPT와 연결되어 있는 겁니다. 마치 두 프로그램이 전화 통화하는 것처럼요. 과거에는 개발자가 아니라면 직접 사용할 일이 거의 없었지만, 바야흐로 '바이브 코딩' 시대에는 누구나 쉽게 AI를 활용하여 코딩하고 API를 사용할 수 있게 되었습니다.\n10. MCP (Model Context Protocol): AI와 도구 연결의 표준\nMCP는 Model Context Protocol의 약자로, AI가 여러 도구들을 사용할 수 있도록 연결해주는 표준 규격입니다. 마치 여러 기기를 연결하는 USB 단자처럼, MCP는 AI와 다양한 서비스를 연결하는 표준이라고 생각하시면 돼요. 예를 들어 MCP를 사용하면 클로드 같은 LLM이 구글 드라이브, 노션, 슬랙 같은 여러 서비스에 직접 접근해서 \"구글 드라이브에 있는 파일 찾아서 요약해줘\"처럼 한 번에 작업을 수행할 수 있죠. 아직 초보자가 직접 설정하기는 어렵지만, \"AI가 여러 서비스를 연결해서 쓸 수 있구나\" 정도만 알아두셔도 충분합니다. 앞으로 점점 더 많이 사용될 중요한 기술이랍니다.\n11. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): 똑똑한 오픈북 AI\nRAG는 Retrieval-Augmented Generation, 즉 검색 증강 생성이라는 뜻인데요. 어렵게 들리지만 쉽게 말하면, AI가 답변할 때 자기가 아는 것만으로 대답하는 게 아니라, 필요한 정보를 먼저 찾아보고 그걸 바탕으로 답변하는 방식입니다. 마치 오픈북 시험을 보는 것과 같아요. 모든 걸 외우지 않아도 책을 찾아보면서 답을 쓸 수 있잖아요? RAG가 바로 그런 원리입니다.\n여러분이 회사 문서를 AI에게 주고 \"우리 회사 휴가 정책이 뭐야?\"라고 물어본다고 가정해볼게요. RAG 방식의 AI는 먼저 여러분이 준 문서에서 휴가 관련 부분을 찾아보고, 그 내용을 바탕으로 답변을 만듭니다. 그냥 AI가 상상해서 답하는 게 아니라 실제 문서를 참고하기 때문에 훨씬 정확하고 신뢰할 수 있는 답변을 받을 수 있죠. 특히 회사 업무나 전문 분야에서 AI가 엉뚱한 답변을 지어내지 않고 실제 자료를 기반으로 답하게 하는 데 정말 유용합니다. Notebook LM 같은 서비스가 바로 이 RAG 방식을 사용하고 있어요.\n12. 마크다운(Markdown) & JSON: AI와 효율적으로 대화하는 비법\n자, 이제 정말 중요한 용어 두 가지를 알려드릴게요. 마크다운과 JSON입니다. 이 두 가지를 알면 AI 활용 효율이 3배는 올라간다고 장담할 수 있어요!\n✅ 마크다운 (Markdown): 간단한 기호로 예쁜 문서 만들기\n마크다운은 간단한 기호로 문서를 예쁘게 꾸미는 방법입니다. 샵(#) 기호를 쓰면 제목이 되고, 대시(-) 기호를 쓰면 목록이 되고, 별표 두 개(**)로 감싸면 굵은 글씨가 되죠. 노션, 깃허브 등에서 많이 사용하고 있으며, 워드처럼 마우스 클릭 없이 키보드만으로 뚝딱 깔끔한 문서를 만들 수 있어요.\n✅ JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): 데이터를 구조화하여 정리하기\nJSON은 데이터를 구조화해서 저장하는 형식이에요. 중괄호({})와 대괄호([])를 사용해서 데이터를 항목과 값으로 명확하게 정리합니다. 프로그래밍에서 주로 쓰이지만, 일반인도 알면 정말 유용해요. 엑셀 데이터를 텍스트로 옮긴 것 같다고 생각하시면 됩니다.\n여기서 중요한 건, 이 형식들을 AI에게 질문할 때 활용하면 답변 품질이 확 올라간다는 거예요! 그냥 일반 대화체로 질문하면 AI가 중간에 정보를 놓칠 수도 있습니다. 하지만 마크다운이나 JSON으로 구조화해서 질문하면 AI가 모든 조건을 명확하게 파악하고 정확히 처리하죠. 조건이 복잡할수록 효과는 더욱 커집니다.\n  실전 꿀팁: 언제 어떤 형식을 쓸까요?\n일상 대화체: 간단한 질문, 빠르게 답변받고 싶을 때 (\"오늘 저녁 뭐 먹을까?\")\n마크다운: 문서, 보고서 작성할 때 (\"회의록을 마크다운으로 작성해줘\")\nJSON: 여러 항목 비교, 데이터 분석, 복잡한 조건 제시할 때 (\"상품 10개를 조건별로 비교 분석해줘\")\n13. 프롬프트 (Prompt): AI에게 하는 질문과 명령\n프롬프트는 AI에게 하는 질문이나 명령을 말합니다. 쉽게 말해 여러분이 AI에게 타이핑하는 모든 문장이 프롬프트예요. \"오늘 날씨 어때?\"도 프롬프트고, \"이 코드 설명해줘\"도 프롬프트죠. 왜 이 용어가 중요하냐면, AI 활용의 90%가 프롬프트를 잘 쓰느냐에 달려 있기 때문입니다. 같은 AI를 써도 프롬프트를 어떻게 쓰느냐에 따라 결과가 천지 차이죠. 마치 검색엔진에서 검색어를 잘 쓰는 것이 중요한 것처럼 말입니다. \"글 써줘\"는 나쁜 프롬프트지만, \"블로그용 AI 활용 팁 글을 초보자 대상으로 1000자로 써줘\"는 구체적인 좋은 프롬프트예요. 프롬프트를 잘 쓰는 기술을 '프롬프트 엔지니어링'이라고 하는데, 이건 다음 시리즈에서 더 자세히 다룰 예정입니다.\n14. 온도 (Temperature): AI 답변의 창의성 조절\n온도는 실제 온도와는 상관없이 AI 답변의 창의성을 조절하는 설정값입니다. 온도가 낮으면 AI가 안전하고 예측 가능한, 교과서 같은 답변을 내놓아요. 반대로 온도가 높으면 AI가 더 창의적이고 다양한 답변을 생성하지만, 가끔 엉뚱한 소리도 할 수 있죠. 마치 자유로운 예술가처럼요. 보통 온도는 0에서 1 사이의 값으로 설정되는데, 0에 가까울수록 \"정확하게만 답해줘, 창의력은 필요 없어\", 1에 가까울수록 \"자유롭게 상상해서 답해줘\"라는 의미로 이해할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, \"회의록 작성해줘\"라고 할 때는 온도를 낮게, \"광고 카피 아이디어 10개 줘\"라고 할 때는 온도를 높게 설정하는 것이 효과적입니다. 대부분의 AI 서비스에서는 직접 온도를 조절할 수는 없지만, 프롬프트에 \"창의적으로 답해줘\" 또는 \"정확하게만 답해줘\"라고 명시하면 비슷한 효과를 낼 수 있답니다.\n15. 할루시네이션 (Hallucination): AI의 그럴듯한 거짓말\n할루시네이션은 AI가 거짓말을 하거나 사실이 아닌 정보를 그럴듯하게 지어내는 현상을 말합니다. 환각이라고도 하죠. 중요한 건 AI가 일부러 거짓말하는 것이 아니라는 점이에요. AI는 '이것이 사실인지 아닌지'를 구분하지 못하고, 그저 학습된 데이터를 바탕으로 가장 그럴듯한 답변을 만들어낼 뿐입니다. 마치 시험 볼 때 모르는 문제를 대충 그럴듯하게 쓰는 것과 비슷하다고 할까요?\n예를 들어, AI에게 \"2024년 노벨 물리학상 수상자는?\"이라고 물었을 때, AI가 존재하지 않는 '존 스미스 박사'를 자신 있게 말할 수도 있어요. 더 무서운 건, AI가 거짓말하는 것처럼 보이지 않는다는 겁니다. 엄청 자신 있고 구체적으로, 심지어 논문 제목까지 지어내면서 설명하기 때문에 초보자분들이 쉽게 속을 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ 할루시네이션 방지법:\n출처 요청: \"출처와 함께 알려줘\"라고 명시하기\n팩트체크: 중요한 정보는 반드시 검색으로 확인하기\n구체적 질문: 모호한 질문보다 구체적으로 물어보기\n최신 정보 주의: 지식 단절 시점 이후 정보는 항상 의심하기\n웹 검색 기능 사용: AI에게 \"웹 검색해서 알려줘\"라고 요청하기\n16. AGI (Artificial General Intelligence): 사람처럼 모든 것을 하는 AI\n마지막 용어는 AGI, 즉 범용 인공지능입니다. 이건 사람처럼 모든 것을 스스로 학습하고 판단할 수 있는 AI를 말해요. 지금 우리가 사용하는 챗GPT나 클로드 같은 AI는 특정 작업만 잘하는 '전문가' AI입니다. 하지만 AGI는 '천재'에 가깝죠. 뭐든 배우고 응용할 수 있는 완전한 형태의 AI라고 할 수 있습니다. 현재 AGI는 아직 존재하지 않아요. 언제 나올지도 미지수이며, 전문가들 사이에서도 \"5년 안에 나온다\", \"50년 걸린다\", 심지어 \"영원히 불가능하다\" 등 다양한 의견이 분분합니다. AGI가 등장하면 세상이 완전히 뒤바뀔 것이기에, AI 뉴스에서 이 단어가 자주 언급되는 것이랍니다. \"아, 완전한 AI를 말하는 거구나\" 정도로만 이해해두시면 충분합니다.\n  핵심 요약\nAI의 기본 이해: AI는 사람처럼 생각하고 대화하는 컴퓨터 프로그램이며, LLM은 언어에 특화된 대규모 AI, SLM은 작지만 빠르고 개인 PC에서 작동하는 AI입니다.\nAI 활용 방식의 이해: GPTs/Gems는 AI의 '역할'을 정해 전문 비서를 만드는 것이고, Projects는 특정 '작업 맥락'을 유지하며 효율적으로 대화와 파일을 관리하는 기능입니다.\nAI 소통의 기술: 토큰, 컨텍스트, 프롬프트의 개념을 이해하고 마크다운/JSON과 같은 구조화된 질문 방식을 활용하면 AI와 훨씬 효율적으로 소통할 수 있습니다.\nAI 활용 시 주의점: AI는 특정 시점까지의 정보만 알고(지식 단절 시점), 가끔 거짓 정보(할루시네이션)를 지어낼 수 있으므로 항상 팩트체크가 중요합니다.\n이 핵심 내용들만 잘 숙지해도 AI 활용에 대한 자신감을 크게 높일 수 있습니다. 더 깊이 있는 내용은 본문에서 확인해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1. AI 초보자인데 무엇부터 시작해야 할까요?\n가장 먼저, 오늘 배운 핵심 용어들을 이해하는 것이 중요합니다. 그 다음에는 챗GPT나 제미나이와 같은 LLM 서비스를 직접 사용해보면서 간단한 질문부터 시작해보세요. 처음에는 일상적인 대화나 정보 검색 위주로 사용하다가, 점차 필요한 기능을 익혀나가는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ2. AI가 거짓말하는 것을 어떻게 알 수 있나요?\nAI가 사실이 아닌 정보를 지어내는 현상을 '할루시네이션'이라고 합니다. 이를 방지하기 위해서는 AI에게 답변의 출처를 요청하거나, 중요한 정보는 반드시 직접 검색을 통해 팩트체크하는 습관을 들이는 것이 중요해요. 특히 의학, 법률, 금융 등 민감한 분야의 정보는 전문가의 확인을 거쳐야 합니다.\nQ3. 무료로 AI를 써볼 수 있는 방법이 있나요?\n네, 물론입니다. 챗GPT, 제미나이 등 대부분의 주요 AI 서비스는 무료 버전을 제공하고 있습니다. 또한, 웹 검색 기능이 포함된 AI를 활용하면 최신 정보도 얻을 수 있어 초보자들이 사용하기 좋습니다. 개인 PC에 직접 설치하여 사용할 수 있는 SLM(소형 언어 모델)도 무료로 활용 가능한 좋은 대안이 될 수 있습니다.\nQ4. AI 용어는 꼭 다 외워야 하나요?\n모든 용어를 완벽하게 외울 필요는 없습니다. 오늘 배운 16가지 용어는 AI를 이해하고 활용하는 데 있어 기본 토대가 되는 개념들이에요. 처음에는 낯설겠지만, AI를 직접 사용하면서 궁금할 때마다 다시 찾아보고 이해하는 과정을 반복하다 보면 자연스럽게 익숙해질 겁니다.\n자, 여러분! 이것으로 'AI 바로 활용하시려면 이건 그냥 외우세요' 파트 1 강의를 마치도록 하겠습니다. 오늘 배운 16가지 핵심 용어, 완벽하게 외울 필요는 없습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. 이번 글은 Google의 Antigravity 사용법에 대해 작성한 글입니다.\n키워드 : Google Antigravity, Google Antigravity 사용법\n\n\nAntigravity\n이름의 유래\nAntigravity 소개글에 작성되어 있는 비전\n    \nOur vision is to ultimately enable anyone with an idea to experience liftoff and build that idea into reality.\nLiftoff라는 용어는 항공기 전체가 지면에서 완전히 떨어지는 시점을 의미하는데, 구글은 자신의 아이디어 구현할 때 누구나 사용할 수 있는 도구를 만들고 싶었던 것 같음. 즉, 개발할 때 생기는 여러 이슈들을 중력이라 생각하고 그것을 대항할 수 있는 도구\n여담으로 Python에서 import antigravity를 하면 XKCD 만화(353번)를 웹 브라우저로 열어주는 이스터에그가 발생하는데, 관련은 없지만 익숙한 용어였음\n\n\n핵심 원칙\nAntigravity의 핵심 원칙은 Trust, Autonomy, Feedback, Self-improvement\nTrust\n오늘날의 대부분의 제품은 두 케이스에 속함\n    \n(1) 에이전트가 수행한 모든 Action과 Tool 호출을 사용자에게 보여줌\n(2) 작업의 컨텍스트나 검증할 방법 없이 최종 코드 변경 사항만 보여줌\n이런 제품들은 에이전트가 왜 이 작업을 했는지, 어떻게 확인해야 하는지를 알기 어려움.\nAntigravity는 사용자가 에이전트가 수행할 작업에 대한 신뢰를 가질 수 있도록 Actifact와 Verfication result(검증 결과)를 제공해 컨텍스트를 제공함\n    \n단순히 개별 Tool 호출이 전부 보이는 것이 아닌, 호출들이 Task 단위로 묶어서 표시함\nTask에 대한 추상화된 정리와 진행 상황을 확인할 수 있음\n사용자가 검증하기 쉬운 형식의 Artifact를 생성함. 예를 들어 Task list(작업 목록), Implementation plan(구현 계획), Walkthrough(단계별 설명서), 스크린샷, 브라우저 녹화 영상\n사용하면서 인상 깊은 부분은 웹브라우저 작업을 할 때 녹화가 되는 기능으로 작업을 어떻게 진행했는지 확인할 수 있었음. Plan 버전으로 실행할 때 Implementation plan, Walkthrough를 제공하는 것도 좋았음\nAutonomy\n요즘 가장 직관적인 제품의 형태는 여러 Surface(편집기, 브라우저, 터미널)에 내장된 에이전트와 동기적으로 동작하는 형태\n    \n에이전트가 자율적으로 프론트엔드 코드를 구현하고, 터미널에서 로컬호스트 실행하고, 브라우저를 작동시켜 새로운 기능이 작동하는지 테스트하는 형태\n이런 자율성을 최적으로 사용하기 위해 사용자가 에이전트와 비동기적으로 상호 작용할 수 있도록 Manager View를 만들었음\nAgent Manager View는 여러 에이전트를 병렬로 생성하고 모니터링할 수 있는 관제탑 스타일의 화면\n기존에 자주 사용하던 VSCode, Cursor 같은 스타일은 Editor View로 존재함(Editor View와 Manager View로 전환하는 단축키는 커맨드(컨트롤) + e)\nFeedback\n에이전트의 지능이 좋아지면서 여러 작업이 가능해졌지만, 아직 완벽하지 않음\n    \n이런 상황에서 피드백을 제공하면 도움이 됨\nAntigravity는 모든 Surface나 Artifact에서 비동기 사용자 피드백을 허용함\nText Artifact에선 주석을 달 수 있고, 스크린샷에서 영역을 선택해서 주석을 달 수 있음\nSelf-improvement\n에이전트가 일하면서 배운 내용을 저장하고, 나중에 비슷한 일을 할 때 참조함\n    \n명시적 정보 : 유용한 코드 snippet, 아키텍처 정보\n\n\n설치\n웹페이지에서 다운로드 가능\nMac 사용자라면 brew로도 설치 가능\n\n  brew install --cask antigravity\n\n    \n처음에 설치하면 기존에 사용하던 IDE(VS Code, Windsurf, Cursor 등)의 설정을 불러올 수 있고, Start fresh를 눌러서 시작할 수 있음\nAgent 설정은 Agent-assisted development으로 설정했음\nAntigravity - 크롬 확장 프로그램 설치\n\n위와 같은 구성을 확인할 수 있고, VSCode와 다르게 우측 상단에 크롬 아이콘이 있어서 눌러봄\n\n설치가 필요한데, 이미 크롬이 설치되어 있어서 경로를 직접 수정함\n    \nSet custom Chrome binary path 클릭해서 경로 지정함\n\n설정에서 Browser로 이동해서 Chrome Binary Path를 지정할 수 있음\n\n다시 크롬 버튼을 누르니 온보딩 페이지로 나오고, 확장 프로그램을 설치함. 이를 통해 Antigravity에서 크롬을 제어할 수 있음\n\n\nAgent\nAgent의 Core Compoent\n    \nReasoning model\nTools\nArtifacts\nKnowledge\nCustomization(커스텀 요소)\n    \nAgent Modes / Settings\nMCP\nRules / Workflow\nModels\nGoogle Vertex Model Garden을 통해 모델 제공\n    \n사용자가 원하는 모델을 선택할 수 있음\nGemini 3 Pro (high)\nGemini 3 Pro (low)\nClaude Sonnet 4.5\nClaude Sonnet 4.5 (thinking)\nClaude Opus 4.5 (thinking)\nGPT-OSS\n사용량 제한은 Plans 문서에서 확인할 수 있음\n    \n현재(25년 12월 기준) Preview라서 무료로 사용 가능하며, Google AI Plan 구독 여부에 따라 제공량이 다름\n기본 제공\n        \n위에 제공하는 Model에 대한 기본 사용\nTab completion 무제한 제공\nCommand requests 무제한 제공\nAgent Manager, Borwser integration 사용 가능\nGoogle AI Ultra : 제일 많은 사용량, 5시간마다 쿼타 갱신\nGoogle AI Pro : 많은 사용량, 5시간마다 쿼타 갱신\nGoogle AI Plan에 가입하지 않은 경우 적당한 사용량을 제공하고 주마다 쿼타 갱신\n아직 key를 사용하는 방식은 지원하지 않으나, 추후에 지원할 가능성이 높음\n\nAntigravity 내부에서 사용하는 모델\nAntigravity가 동작하는 과정에서 모델을 사용하고 있으며, 사용자가 설정할 수 없음\nUI 목업 생성, 웹페이지나 앱에서 사용할 이미지 생성, 아키텍처 다이어그램 생성 : Nano Banana Pro\n브라우저 서브 에이전트가 브라우저에서 클릭, 스크롤, 입력 등 브라우저를 제어할 때 : Gemini 2.5 Pro UI Checkpoint(내부적으로 커스텀한 모델로 추측)\n체크포인팅, 컨텍스트 요약할 때 : Gemini 2.5 Flash\n코드의 Semantic Search(의미 기반 검색) : Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite\nTools(MCP)\nMCP를 사용해 Antigravity가 데이터베이스에 직접 접근해서 정보를 가져올 수 있음\n연결 방법\n우측 상단에 있는 Agent의 우측에 …을 클릭 -> MCP Servers 클릭\n\n필요한 MCP 검색(저는 supabase)\n\nInstall 클릭 후, 환경 설정\n\n\n이제 MCP의 Tool을 사용할 수 있음\n\nArtifacts\nArtifacts는 에이전트가 작업을 완료하거나 작업과 생각을 사용자에게 전달하기 위해 생성하는 모든 것\n예시\n    \nTask list(할 일 목록)\nImplementation plan(구현 계획)\nWalkthrough(워크스루) : 변경 사항, 작업 과정 요약\nScreenshots(화면 캡처)\nBrowser Recordings(브라우저 녹화)\nKnowledge(지식)\n아래 실제로 실행하는 부분에서 확인 가능\nAgent Modes / Settings\n에이전트의 모드나 설정에 대한 이해가 필요함\n대화 모드\n대화할 때 2가지 모드 중 선택할 수 있음\n    \nPlanning, Fast\nPlanning : 작업 실행 전에 Plan을 세움. 복잡한 작업에서 활용하는 것이 좋으며, 작업에 따라 아티팩트 생성, 계획 등을 수행\nFast : 에이전트가 작업을 바로 실행함. 간단한 작업에 사용하며, 속도가 중요하고 품질 저하에 대한 걱정이 적을 때 사용\n대화할 때 바로 설정할 수 있음\n\n전반적인 설정\nAntigravity Settings에서 설정할 수 있으며, Artifact Review Policy, Terminal Command Auto Execution Policy를 정의할 수 있음\n\nArtifact Review Policy(아티팩트 리뷰 정책)\n    \n에이전트가 아티팩트에 대해 리뷰를 어떻게, 언제 물어볼지 결정하는 정책\nAlways Proceed : 에이전트가 리뷰를 요청하지 않고 작업 진행\nAgent Decides : 에이전트가 리뷰 요청 시점을 스스로 결정\nRequest Review : 에이전트가 항상 리뷰 요청\nTerminal Command Auto Execution Policy(터미널 커맨드 자동 실행 정책)\n    \n에이전트가 터미널 컴맨드를 자동으로 실행할지 결정하는 정책\nAlways Proceed : 에이전트가 터미널 명령을 실행하기 전에 확인하지 않고 실행\nAgent Decides : 에이전트가 터미널 명령을 실행하기 전에 스스로 판단\nRequest Review : 에이전트가 터미널 명령을 실행하기 전에 항상 확인\n두가지 설정 모두 Agent Decides로 설정하고 사용 중\n유사하게 Browser Javascript Execution Policy도 존재함(설정 -

(카탈루냐 광장에서 도보 5 ~ 10분 사이)\n  \n우선 호텔이 아니라 호스텔이라 그런지 입구부터 1층도 아니고, 엘레베이터도 없고 저 긴 계단을 캐리어를 끌고 올라가야한다.\n맨처음에는 아무런 안내도 없어서 여기가 맞나?? 싶어서 반신반의 하면서 올라갔다.\n데스크에는 사람이 없을 때가 태반인데 그거 때문인가 나한테 언제 체크인하는지 물어봤는데 그 시간에만 자리를 지키고 나머지 시간에는 농땡이를 피우는 것 같았다.\n그리고 바르셀로나 같은 경우에 숙소에 관광세(숙소 등급 * 몇박 묵는지에 따라 다름)까지 내야해서 관광세로 €10.5 (17,825원)을 현장에서 결제해야했다. (다행히 카드 결제 가능)\n    \n그리고 가장 경악했던 게 화장실이 너무 좁아서 똥을 쌀 때면 벽과 거의 마주봐야하고 그리고 온수가 안 나온다는 것이었다.\n데스크에 문의해봐도 보일러가 고장이 난 거 같다고만 말하고 내가 또 영어도 잘 안 되고, 상대방도 영어를 잘 못해서 언어가 통하지 않아서 있는동안 샤워는 못하고 그냥 머리만 찬물로 감았다.\n호스텔이라 그런지 별로 정감 가지 않는 숙소였고, 근데 여기는 물가도 높고 관광객이 많아서 그런지 좀만 좋은 호텔로 가면 3박에 90만원 정도도 나와서 큰 고민 없이 이 호스텔로 예약한 건데 후회가 됐다.\n보일러가 고장나지 않았는지 확인하고 고장났다면 절대절대 예약하지 않는 걸 추천한다.\n구글 리뷰를 보면 1점 테러도 많은 걸 보면 여기는 정말정말 비추 한다.\n\n카탈루냐 광장 근처로 가니 버스킹을 하는 사람들이 보였는데 이 추운 날씨에 반팔이라니 그 열정이 엄청났다. \n그리고 너무 배고파서 이른 저녁을 먹으려고 한식당을 뒤지다보니 하나 식당이라고 나름 유명한 한식당이 나왔다.  \n  \n근데 가니까 문이 닫혀있는 게 아닌가?? 구글에도 Closed라고 돼있긴 했지만 오늘 저녁 장사를 하는 걸 봤기 때문에 혹시나 하는 마음에 같는데 역시나 닫혀있던 것이었다.\n찾아보니 점심 장사는 4시 반에 끝나고 저녁 장사는 7시 반에 한다고 돼있었다.\n그러면 브레이크 타임이라는 의미인데 아예 불까지 꺼져있는 게 이해가 안 갔다.\n챗GPT한테 물어보니 한국처럼 가게는 열어두고 휴식/저녁장사 준비를 하는 게 아니라 진짜로 퇴근했다가 다시 출근하는 거라고 했다.\n그리고 왜 이렇게 늦게 저녁장사를 시작하냐고 물어보니 뭐 얘네가 원래 타임존도 +00:00이었는데 과거에 중앙 유럽 표준시(CET)로 한시간 땡기면서 원래 시간대보다 한시간 빠르게 살고 있다고 한다.\n그래서 그렇게 저녁을 늦게 먹는 거라고 한다.\n내가 갔을 때가 5시 쯤이어서 2시간 반을 돌아댕겨야 했다. (밖이 너무 추웠는데 이 때 돌아다니면 안 됐었을 것 같다.)\n  \n돌아다니다 보니 사람들이 줄지어 서있길래 뭔가 싶어서 찾아보니 츄러스 맛집 Xurreria Laietana라고 한다.\n나는 좀이따 저녁으로 한식을 맛있게 먹어야하니 먹고 싶은 걸 참았다.  \n  \n그리고 쓰레기통 주변에 쓰레기가 너무 지저분하게 널브러져있어서 여기는 제대로 청소를 안 하나? 싶었다.\n        \n그리고 튀르키예에서 이미 많이 봐서 유럽풍 건물에는 큰 감흥이 없었지만, 그래도 바르셀로나 분위기가 나는 건물이나 풍경이 많아서 볼만했다.  \n    \n그리고 락을 주제로 한 기념품 가게도 보여서 둘러볼만 했다.  \n        \n그리고 라 람블라 거리 근처에 있는 라 보케리아 시장에서도 이것 저것 파는 걸 보는 묘미가 있었다.  \n  \n대충 관광을 마치고 7시 반경에 다시 하나식당으로 가니 문이 열려있었다.\n이 얼마만에 먹는 한식인가… 혼자 가니 눈치보여서 순두부찌개 + 제육볶음 두개를 시켜서 과식을 하였다.\n처음에는 순두부찌개가 얼큰한 것처럼 느껴졌다가 먹다보니 그냥 그랬고, 제육볶음도 좀 달아서 그저 그랬다.\n그래도 스페인에서 이정도 한식을 누릴 수 있다는 게 참 좋았고, 근데 가격은 사악했다. (€32.4로 54,903원을 냈다.)\n한끼에 5만 4천원이라니… 엄청난 플렉스를 했다고 생각을 했고 그래도 메뉴 두개를 시켰고 여기 물가를 고려하면 나름 합당하다고는 생각했다.  \n\n  \n숙소로 돌아오는 길에 카탈루냐 광장의 분수대를 볼 수 있었다.  \n  \n그리고 스페인에서 자라를 보았는데 자라가 스페인의 브랜드인 건 처음 알았다.\n그래서 한국 대비 옷이 싸다고 해서 따뜻한 옷이나 하나 살까… 고민하다가 귀찮아서 그냥 숙소로 가서 잤다.\n2일차 (구엘 공원 + 응급실)\n2일차에는 새벽에 깨서 화장실을 가는데 뭔가 좀 어지럽다는 느낌이 들었다.\n근데 뭐 가끔씩 어지럼증을 약하게 느낄 때가 있곤 하다보니 뭐 별일이 아닌 줄 알았다.  \n  \n아침이 되어 구엘 공원으로 가기 위해 지하철을 타러 갔다.\n스크린도어가 없는 지하철역은 오랜만에 가다보니 뭔가 무서웠다.\n  \n그리고 교통카드도 코팅된 종이를 사용해서 찍는 게 신기했다. 일반적인 플라스틱 카드가 아니라 훼손되는 건 아닐까 걱정이 됐다.  \n  \n길거리에 다니는 버스도 지하철처럼 중간에 이어지는 부분이 있는 게 신기했다.  \n  \n구엘공원으로 가기 전에 카페에서 간단하게 아침을 먹었다. (€9.75로 16,542원이었다.)\n근데 먹고 나서 나중에 알고보니 이게 위에 엄청난 자극을 주는 조합이었다.\n이베리코 염장햄 샌드위치(나트륨) + 오렌지 주스(산성) + 커피(카페인)이 공복에 확 들어가니 위에 무리를 줬던 것 같다.\n  \n구엘 공원으로 가는 계단인데 건물 외부에 저렇게 에스컬레이터가 있는 것도 신기했다.  \n        \n구엘공원은 건축가인 가우디가 후원자인 구엘의 의뢰를 받아 고급 전원 주택 단지를 조성할 계획으로 만들어진 공간이라고 알고 있다.\n그래서인지 볼만한 거리들이 많았고 가이드를 통해 설명을 받는 관광객이 많았고 심지어 한국인 무리들도 꽤나 보였다.\n구엘공원의 입장료는 €28(47,503원)이었다.\n  \n구엘 공원 내부에 놀이터도 있었는데 이건 여기에 왜 있는 거지?? 하는 생각이 들었다.\n가족끼리 왔다가 아이가 지쳐하면 여기서 놀아주는 건가?? 싶었다.\n\n구엘 공원 안에서도 신기한 악기를 가지고 버스킹을 하는 아줌마가 있었다. 뭔가 음악 CD를 팔고 있었는데 본인이 연주한 음원인 것 같았다.\n그리고 다른 버스킹하는 사람들은 듣는사람이 있던 없던 상관없이 본인의 예술혼을 불태우며 연주를 하는데 이 아줌마는 관광객 무리가 지나가지 않으면 바로 연주를 중단하는 모습을 보고 자본주의의 노예구나 싶었다.\n구엘공원 관광을 마치고 공원 내부에 있는 공짜 화장실에 가서 볼일을 보고 나니 갑자기 토가 하고 싶어졌다.\n뭔가 몸상태가 이상해졌다는 것을 느껴서 뒤에 있던 일정들은 생각하지 않고 숙소로 가서 토를 하고 쉬었다.\n토를 하니 좀 나아지는 것 같아서 좀만 쉬면 괜찮아지겠지~ 하고 있었는데 30분 정도 지나자 또 토를 하고 싶어져서 토를 했다.  \n      \n그리고 챗GPT에게 내 상황을 설명하고, 뭐 때문에 그런 건지 지금 내 몸이 어떤 상황인 건지, 앞으로 어떻게 해야하는지 등등 자세히 물어보았다.\n근데 계속 쉬어도 나을 기미가 보이지 않자 병원을 가야하나 고민이 들어서 또 챗GPT한테 엄청 상담을 했더니 현재 내 상황이라면 응급실을 가는 게 좋을 거 같다고 얘기했다.\n말도 잘 안 통하고, 외국인 신분이고 돈이 엄청 깨질텐데… 하는 걱정에 가고 싶지 않았지만 이건 도저히 가만히 있어서는 해결이 될 문제가 아닐 거 같았다.\n그래서 어떤 응급실을 가야하는지 물어봤는데 우버는 택시 잡는데 기다리고 또 내 숙소 앞까지 택시가 못 올수도 있고, 차타면 오히려 멀미가 더 심해질 거 같았다.\n그래서 걸어가기로 마음을 먹었는데 한 2~30분 정도 걸리는 거리였는데 속이 안 좋다보니 더 천천히 갔다. 고개를 좌우로 돌리기만 해도 머리가 핑 도는 거 같아서 최대한 고개를 고정한 채로 천천히 걸어갔다.  \n그래서 Hospital Clínic de Barcelona로 갔는데 옆건물을 잘못 찾아갔는데 거기는 응급실이 아니라 뭔가 박물관? 전시관? 이었던 거 같기도 하다.\n그 건물 앞에서 관광객 무리가 있고 현지 가이드에게 뭔가 설명을 듣는 것 같아 보였다.\n그래서 어디로 가야하는지 다시 설명을 듣고 응급실로 갔다.  \n    \n응급실에는 3시 쯤에 도착해서 접수를 하다가 한 20분 정도 대기하다가 의사를 만나서 간단히 증상을 설명했다.\n그리고 나서 무한 대기의 시작이었다. 여기서부터 또 한 3시간을 대기한 것 같다.\n그리고 나서 내 순서가 되어 엘리베이터를 타고 4층으로 갔는데 장소를 이동해서인지 또 구토감이 올라와서 화장실로 가서 토를 하였다.\n그리고 여기서도 한 30분 ~ 1시간 정도 대기를 한 거 같고 그 다음에는 뭔가 빨간 젤리 같은 걸 먹어보라고 했다.  \n  \n내 위가 이것들을 먹을 준비가 됐는지 확인하는 거 같은데 먹고 나서 한 20분 지나니까 또 바로 토를 했다.\n그리고 또 한 30분 정도를 기다리니 그제서야 수액을 놔줬다.\n수액을 다 맞고나니 물을 줘서 물을 마셨는데 또 20분 정도 지나니까 토를 했다.\n그러니까 이번에는 수액을 한번 더 놔줬다.\n이 때 수액을 맞느라 옷을 벗었더니 체온이 35.9도까지 떨어져서 몸이 달달달 떨려서 가지고 온 잠바를 덮었다.\n그리고 수액을 다 맞고 나니 나보고 “Home! Go home!” 이러는 것이었다.\n나는 아직 어지럽다고 했는데도 그냥 집으로 가라고 했다. 말 안 통하는 해외에서 아프기까지 하니 정말 서러웠다.\n그리고 응급실 비용은 €295(500,679원)이 나왔다. (다행히 여행자 보험에서 100% 돌려받았다.)\n1층으로 내려가니 또 구토감이 몰려와서 한번 개워냈다.\n그리고 응급실을 나오니 10시가 넘은 시간이었다. 유럽의 병원이 얼마나 느리고 답답한지, 한국의 병원이 얼마나 쾌적한 건지 깨닫게 되었다.\n한시간만 기다려도 너무 답답하다고 생각했는데 그건 아주 선녀였다.\n아직 어지럼증이 남아있기 때문에 고개를 고정한 채로 천천히 숙소로 이동했다.\n근데 숙소에 들어서자마자 또 구토감이 밀려와서 한번 더 토를 했다.  \n이렇게 오늘 하루는 반나절은 관광을, 반나절은 응급실 신세를 졌다.\n아마 내 생각에는 아래와 같은 원인 때문에 이 지경에 이르른 것 같다.  \n\n튀르키예에서부터 공복(페티예에서 저녁 굶었고, 그 다음날 바르셀로나로 이동하면서 경유하느라 점심을 굶었고)을 반복\n스페인에 오자마자 폭식(바르셀로나 도착한 날 저녁에 한식으로 순두부찌개+제육볶음)을 했고  \n2주가 넘는 여행 기간동안 피로와 스트레스가 누적되고\n바르셀로나로 오니까 갑자기 추위가 시작되어 이 또한 몸에 영향을 준 거 같음.\n그리고 아침으로 공복에 위에 자극을 아주 강하게 줌 (나트륨 덩어링인 이베리코 염장햄 + 산성을 띄는 오렌지 쥬스 + 카페인 덩어리 커피)\n\n그리고 오늘 원래 가려고 예약했던 코스들을 하나도 가지 못해 피해가 막심했다.  \n\n카사 바트요 입장료 €29 (49,200원)  \n카사 밀라 입장료 €29 (49,200원)\n\n3일차 (숙소에서 휴식)\n아침까지도 공복으로 계속 있었다.\n그리고 계속 쉬다보니 속은 많이 편해졌지만 아직 어지럼증은 좀 있었다. 그래도 물 정도는 마실 수 있을 것 같아 물을 조금씩 한모금 마셔보았다.\n그런데 물을 마시니까 토하고 싶다는 생각이 또 들었는데 여기서 또 토를 하면 몸에 자극을 줄 수도 있다고 하여 몸을 세우고 억지로 참았다.\n좀 쉬니 안정이 되었고, 물 한 모금도 천천히 나눠마셔야하는데 너무 답답해서 한 번에 먹은 게 문제였던 것 같았다.\n그래서 물도 아주 천천히 나눠서 마셨다.\n고개를 돌리기만 해도 어지러우니 핸드폰도 제대로 하지 못하고 근데 심심은 또 하고 그래서 라디오 같은 게 필요했다.  \n\n  \n전에 문득 봤었던 침착맨의 대항해시대 2가 떠올랐다.\nBGM이 잔잔해서 듣다보면 잠이 올 거 같아서 플레이리스트를 재생하고 그냥 아무생각 없이 듣고만 있다보니 잠이 들었다.\n그리고 일어나서 또 대항해시대를 듣다가 자다가를 반복하다가 저녁이 되었다.\n계속 물만 먹다보니 뭔가 회복이 더딘 것 같아 바나나 같이 뭔가 에너지를 좀 더 공급할 수 있는 것을 먹어야 좀 더 빠르게 회복이 되지 않을까 싶었다.  \n\n그래서 챗GPT한테 물어서 어디가 문을 열었는지, 어디서 뭘 사면 좋을지 물어봐서 바나나, 배, 사과를 사왔다.\n일요일이라 주변에 있는 까르푸가 열지 않아 왕복 30분 거리에 있는 까르푸 익스프레스에 다녀왔다.\n30분을 걸어갔다오느라 정말 힘들었고, 일행이 왔더라면 부탁을 하면 될텐데… 하고 혼자 온 게 더 서러워지는 순간이었다.\n머리도 못 감고 거의 폐인 몰골로 다녀왔는데 어제보다는 그래도 확실히 어지럼증이 좀 줄어들긴 했지만 여전히 고개를 돌리면 어지러워서 차가 오나 안 오나 보는 것 자체가 고역이었다.\n가는 길에 팔레스타인 시위도 하고 멋진 장식도 있어서 사진을 찍고 싶기는 했지만 너무 어지럽고 도무지 그걸 찍을 여력이 되지 않아 사진은 하나도 못 찍었다.\n24시간 넘게 아무것도 먹지도 못하고 속도 편해져서 바나나 1개를 순식간에 먹어 치우고 배도 조금 먹었는데 조금 지나자 더부룩해졌다.\n좀 나아진 거 같다고 너무 성급하게 먹은 것 같았다.  \n그리고 이 상태로 더이상 여행을 강행할 수는 없어서 하루 빨리 한국으로 돌아가 제대로 치료도 받고 회복하고 싶어졌다.\n지금 상태라면 내일은 비행기를 탈 수 있을 거 같았다. 날이 바뀌어서 항공권 예약을 못 할 수도 있기 때문에 얼른 예약을 했다.\n그리고 내일은 숙소에서 체크아웃을 해야하기 때문에 더더욱 좋은 타이밍이었다.\n누군가와 함께 왔다면 일행에게 양해를 구하거나 굉장히 미안한 상황이었는데 그나마 이럴 때는 혼자서 결정을 하면 되기 때문에 다행이었다.  \n원래 오늘은 사그라다 파밀리아를 관광하기로 했는데 그것도 못가서 57,300원을 손해 보았다.  \n4일차 (한국으로 복귀)\n아침이 되니 어제 사온 과일들을 다 먹었다. (사과는 너무 푸석푸석해서 먹다가 말았다.)\n그래서 숙소 근처 까르푸에서 저녁까지 먹을 걸 사와야했다.  \n  \n그래서 챗GPT한테 뭘 사먹으면 좋을지 물어보았다.\n지금 내 어지럼증을 보완하려면 전해질 보충을 위해서 이온음료까지 추천해준 게 참 신기했다.  \n    \n다행히 오늘은 월요일이라 숙소 근처에 있는 까르푸가 열어서 여기서 바나나/플레인 요거트/이온음료/마르게리타 쿠키를 샀다.\n그리고 숙소에서 점심으로 바나나와 플레인 요거트, 이온음료를 먹었다.  \n12시가 돼서 체크아웃을 한 이후에는 바로 공항으로 이동하였다.\n그냥 한시라도 빨리 한국으로 귀국하고 싶어서 어디 관광하고 싶다는 생각도 들지 않았고 그러다보니 그냥 공항에서 기다리는 게 마음이 편할 것 같았다.\n그래서 2시간 단위로 바나나와 요거트를 먹으며 견뎠다. 그리고 좀 나아진 것 같아서 핸드폰으로 유튜브나 넷플릭스를 계속 봤는데 한 5시간 정도 보니까 너무 어지러워서 그냥 눈을 감고 대기했다.  \n  \n오후 8시 반에 출발해서 12시간 20분의 기나긴 여정이었다.\n항공권은 93만원이 들었다.\n근데 청천벽력같은 소식이 들렸다. 지연이 됐다는 소식이다. 공항에서만 대략 7시간 정도를 기다렸는데 더 기다려야한다는 소식에 절망이었다.\n그렇게 1시간이 지연돼서 9시 반에 출발을 했다.\n그리고 아직 속이 완전히 나은 게 아니기 때문에 기내식은 하나도 먹지 않고 물만 마셨다.\n근데 잠은 오지 않고 자세는 뭔가 불편한 거 같고, 자도 10분 자고 깨고 반복하다보니 너무 스트레스였다.\n언제 도착하는 걸까… 계속 핸드폰 시간만 보았고 정말 고통의 시간이었다. 그래도 시간은 흘러 결국 인천공항에 도착하였다.\n원래는 집에 혼자 가려고 했는데 몸이 이래서 부모님께 부탁을 해서 부모님 차를 타고 집에 가서 흰죽을 먹으니 살 것만 같았다.  \n그리고 몸을 좀 추스르고 보니 앞으로 남은 예약 내역들이 취소 안 되는 것들이 태반이어서 엄청난 손해를 봤다는 사실을 깨달았다. (요금을 좀 싸게하는 대신 취소가 안 되는 옵션으로 예약함.)\n좀 여유롭게 생각을 해야하는데 너무 타이트하게 일정을 잡았던 게 화근이었고, 몸이 아프니까 돈이 아깝다는 생각이 들지 않았는데 지금 와서 보니 정말 아까웠다 ㅠㅠ…\n\n바르셀로나 -> 세비야 항공권 32만원 (당일에 취소하려고 하니 2,900원만 환불되었다.)  \n세비야 숙소 3박 4일 37만원 (이건 하나도 환불을 받지 못했다.)  \n알카사르 궁전 입장료 €15.5 (26,351원)  \n세비야 대성당 + 히랄다 탑 입장료 €19 (32,298원)  \n세비야 <-> 론다 당일치기 왕복권 기차표 €83.35 (141,534원)  \n세비야 -> 포르투갈 리스본 항공권 29만원 (이것도 하나도 환불받지 못했다.)  \n포르투 -> 인천공항 항공권 26만원 (113만원인데 그나마 환불 받아서 이정도였다.)\n\n스페인 여행을 마치며\n  \n한국으로 북귀하고 3~4일 정도 쉬니까 몸이 많이 나아서 삼겹살과 된장찌개 같은 일반식은 가능하게 되었다.\n이비인후과를 가니 왼쪽으로 고개를 돌리면 눈이 한박자 늦게 따라온다고 하여 재활운동을 알려줘서 그것도 열심히 따라하니 어지러운 것도 말끔히 나았다.  \n한번 외국에 가서 아파보니 역시 건강이 최고란 사실을 깨닫기도 하고, 그렇게 나가서 고생할 바에 또 가야하나?? 란 생각도 들었다.\n유럽을 가긴 갔는데 하루만 제대로 관광하고 나머지는 다 아팠다보니 뭔가 아쉽기도 했는데 이게 트라우마가 되어 나중에 또 갈 수 있을까? 란 생각이 들었고, 누군가와 함께 가는 게 아니면 나 혼자의 의지로는 굳이 유럽을 가지는 않을 것 같다.\n이미 체험할 것이나 볼 거는 대충 본 거 같고 또 나는 건축이나 그런 것보다는 자연 & 동물파라서 그런 걸 볼 수 있는 곳으로 더더욱 가지 않을까 싶었다.\n당분간 해외를 나갈 일은 없겠지만 그래도 이렇게 길게 쉰 김에 좋은 경험을 했던 것 같다.\n그리고 다른 곳에서도 챗GPT의 도움을 많이 받았지만 스페인에서는 응급실부터 그 이후 휴식/식사까지 정말 많은 도움을 받았다.\nAI가 세상을 이롭게 하는 순간이라고 느꼈고 나도 누군가에게 도움이 되는 것을 만들고 싶다는 생각을 하였다.",

        "contentSnippet": "튀르키예는 동물 친화적인 곳이어서 자연을 사랑하는 내 입장에서는 매우 만족스러웠다.  \n시리즈\n\n해외여행 1편 - 케냐\n해외여행 3편 - 스페인\n\n튀르키예로 떠나기\n원래는 튀르키예(터키)를 갈 생각은 크게 없었다. 근데 탄자니아로 가려고 계획하던 당시 튀르키예에서 경유하는 항공권이 있길래 ‘겸사겸사 튀르키예를 먼저 여행하고, 다음에 탄자니아로 가면 경유 없이 직항으로만 갈 수 있지 않을까??’하는 생각에 튀르키예도 여행 계획을 세우게 되었다.\n하지만 큰 일을 뭔가 빨리 해치우고 싶어서 먼저 사파리를 해치우고 그 다음에 느긋하게 내 일정대로 여행할 수 있는 튀르키예로 가기로 마음 먹었다.\n튀르키예에서 뭔일이 나면 케냐에 일정대로 못 들어갈 수도 있어서 사파리를 못 즐길 수도 있다는 걱정이 들어 먼저 케냐에 가서 사파리를 해치우고 튀르키예로 향하게 되었다.\n  \n근데 케냐에서 튀르키예까지 직항이 하루에 한 번, 새벽에 밖에 없는 것이었다.\n케냐에서 새벽에 나와서 택시타고 돌아다니는 건 너무 위험하다고 생각이 됐다.  \n\n어쩔 수 없이 에티오피아의 아디스 아바바 공항을 경유하는 항공권으로 끊었다.\n케냐까지 오는 만큼 길지는 않았지만, 아디스 아바바 공항까지 2시간, 그리고 아디스 아바바 공항에서 5시간 10분 가량 대기, 이스탄불 공항까지 5시간 55분 가량 소요되는 총 13시간 5분의 긴 여정이었다.\n항공권은 172만원이 들었다.\n  \n아디스 아바바 공항까지는 2시간 밖에 걸리지 않았지만 기내식이 나왔다. 에티오피아의 대표 항공사다보니 이런 서비스 측면에서는 좋았던 것 같다.\n그리고 아프리카(?)답게 기내식에도 콩이 나왔다.  \n    \n그리고 아디스 아바바 공항에서 이제 5시간 10분을 대기해야하다보니 커피를 사서 노트북으로 여행 계획이나 짜려고 했다.\n그래서 커피를 주문하고 자리에 앉으려고 하니 테이블은 식사고객 전용이라고 내쫓는 것이었다.\n새삼 한국 스타벅스에서 노트북만 들고 죽치고 있는 게 얼마나 감사한 일인지 깨달았고, 공항 내를 방황하다가 겨우 자리를 발견해서 노트북으로 스페인 여행 계획을 짰다.\n근데 공항의 무료 와이파이를 이용하다보니 인터넷이 너무 자주 끊겼지만, 챗GPT는 그래도 쓸만한 수준이었다. (이번 여행은 챗GPT가 없었더라면 불가능했을 것이다.)  \n  \n오랜 대기 끝에 이스탄불 행 비행기를 탔고 여기서도 기내식이 나왔다.  \n\n  \n이스탄불로 가는 야간 비행 중 찍은 건데 야경이 참 예뻤다. 비행기를 타면서 보는 풍경은 어디든 예쁜 것 같다.\n그리고 시꺼먼 바다만 보다가 불빛을 보면 ‘아~ 곧 도착하겠구나!’ 하는 희망도 생겨서 더 좋았다.  \n1일차 (이스탄불 구시가지 + 신시가지)\n  \n긴 여정 끝에 이스탄불 공항에 도착할 수 있었다.\n튀르키예(+03:00)와 한국(+09:00)의 시차는 6시간이었기 때문에 한국 시간으로는 12:35 쯤으로 점심 먹을 시간이었다.\n그리고 케냐와 튀르키예는 시차가 없기 때문에 별도로 시차 때문에 고생할 일은 없었다.\n  \n이스탄불은 크게 3가지 구역으로 나뉘어져있는데 나는 세 구역을 다 둘러볼 생각이었기 때문에 그 중간 지점인 구시가지에 숙소(Sirkeci Mansion Hotel)를 잡았다. (2박 3일 기준 조식포함 263,316원)  \n    \n먼저 공항에서 Havaist라는 공항 버스를 타고 이동(버스 내에서 카드로 결제)해서 숙소 근처 정류장에 내렸는데 페리(배로 이동하는 대중교통) 선착장 근처에 내리게 되었다.\n탁 트인 바다와 배를 보니 뭔가 시원시원 했다.  \n    \n그리고 한국에서는 고층빌딩만 보다가 뭔가 유럽풍의 건물들을 보다보니 새삼 ‘내가 튀르키예에 온 게 맞구나~’하는 생각이 들었다.  \n\n  \n그리고 이스탄불에는 또 신기한 교통수단인 ‘트램’이라는 게 존재한다. 지상에 사람들도 다니는 도로에 저렇게 전철이 움직인다는 게 신기했다. 사람들이 무단횡단도 많이하고, 부정탑승도 많이 할 거 같은데 괜찮으려나…? 하는 생각이 들었다.  \n  \n그리고 이스탄불은 길냥이들의 천국이라고 들었는데 가자마자 나한테 앵기는 길냥이를 볼 수 있었다. 아마 사람들이 먹을 걸 주다보니 사람을 겁내지 않는 것 같았다.\n동물을 싫어하는 사람이라면 이스탄불에 와서는 못 살 거 같았다.  \n      \n아직 체크인 시작이 되지 않아 숙소에 짐만 맡기고 가려고 했는데 아침도 먹어도 된다고 해서 맛있게 먹었다.\n지중해 근처에 있는 나라라 그런지 올리브와 치즈가 종류별로 있어서 이들만의 건강 비결도 무엇인지 살짝 알 것 같았다.  \n    \n그리고 바로 톱카프 궁전을 구경하러 갔는데 아주 돈독이 올라서 풀패키지로만 판매를 하는 것이었다.\n나는 톱카프 궁전이랑 정원만 좀 구경하고 싶었는데 ‘하렘구역 + 톱카프 궁전 + 아야 이리니 교회’까지 포함된 패키지만 팔았고 가격은 $57 정도 하였다.  \n        \n주로 가이드를 끼고 오는 사람들이 대부분이었고, 나는 그냥 있는 느낌 그대로 느끼러 오디오 가이드만 들으면서 이동했는데 비슷한 전시품에 질리기만 하였다.  \n\n그리고 어디서 기도 소리 같은 게 들려오길래 녹음된 걸 트는 줄 알았는데 실제 사람이 앉아서 소리를 내고 있어서 신기했다.  \n  \n나는 8만원 넘게 내고 들어왔는데 고양이는 공짜로 들어왔을 생각을 하니 ‘여기는 고양이 팔자가 상팔자구나’하는 생각이 들었다.  \n      \n하렘 구역을 지나 정원 구역으로 들어서니 힐링이 되는 느낌이었다. 뭔가 탁 트인 광경에 새들도 보이고 ‘역시 나는 자연파구나’싶었다.\n    \n그리고 시계 박물관 같은 것도 있어서 대충 둘러보고 나왔다.\n오후에 신시가지 구경을 가려고 계획했는데 톱카프 궁전에서 너무 많은 시간을 써버렸다. 돈이 아까우니 조금이라도 더 보자는 생각으로 둘러봤는데 솔직히 하렘구역은 별 감흥이 없어서 돈과 시간 모두 아까웠다.  \n  \n톱카프 궁전을 나와 아야 소피아로 향했는데 내부를 구경하려면 티켓을 사야하는 것 같았다.\n티켓 사는 줄도 있고, 시간도 없고, 내부는 뭐 비슷비슷 할 거 같아서 그냥 바깥만 구경했다.  \n  \n그리고 바로 맞은편에는 블루 모스크(술탄 아흐메트 모스크)가 있는데 기도 시간이라 내부에 출입이 불가능해서 여기도 그냥 바깥만 구경했다.  \n  \n그리고 점심은 챗GPT가 추천해준 Sultanahmet Köftecisi라는 식당에서 소고기 쾨프테를 먹었다.\n소고기 완자라고 하길래 소고기이기도 하고 양고기도 아니니까 고기 잡내 같은 건 없겠지? 싶었는데 기름향인지 뭔지 너무 느끼한 냄새랑 맛이 확 올라왔다.\n결국 2/3만 먹고 나올 수 밖에 없었다. 혼자서 먹는데 $16.9(24,632원)이 들었다.\n그리고 식전에 저런 빵을 거의 대부분 주는데 저런 빵을 에크맥이라고 불렀다.  \n  \n점심을 먹고 신시가지로 이동하기 위해 트램을 탔는데 생각보다 사람이 많아서 뭔가 소매치기를 당하지는 않을까 무서워서 정신을 바짝차렸다.  \n    \n신시가지로 이동하니 여기서도 팔자좋게 꾸벅꾸벅 졸고있는 길냥이를 볼 수 있었다. 이스탄불은 그냥 길냥이 천국이다.  \n  \n그리고 여기는 관광객 뿐만 아니라 현지인들의 모습도 조금 볼 수 있었는데 놀이터에서 노는 가족들이 보였다.\n    \n그리고 신시가지 거리를 걸었는데 역시나 사람들이 굉장히 많았고 유럽풍 건물을 굉장히 많이 볼 수 있어서 좋았다.\n그리고 저렇게 큰 창문을 닦는 모습을 보니 옛날 영화의 시녀? 같은 그런 느낌의 사람처럼 보여서 뭔가 신기했다.  \n          \n성 안토니오 성당을 왔는데 천주교도가 아니지만 그래도 성당이 주는 분위기와 웅장함에 관광할만 한 것 같았다.  \n    \n그리고 고양이 뿐만 아니라 강아지들도 굉장히 평화롭게 살고 있었지만 살이 너무 뒤룩뒤룩 찐 강아지는 좀 걱정이 될 정도였다.\n    \n그리고 여기에 카이막 맛집이 있다고 해서 Karaköy Özsüt라는 카이막 집에 방문했는데 여기는 짠내투어에서도 방문한 곳이라고 한다.\n들어가니까 거의 한국인 정모하듯이 한국인 손님들로 가득하였고, 호불호 없이 달달하고 맛있을만한 아주 대중적인 디저트라는 느낌이 들었다.\n백종원 카이막은 Börekçi’nin Yeri라는 가게인데 내가 있는 곳과는 거리가 멀어서 그냥 신시가지에 있는 카이막 가게만 가서 먹어보았다.\n    \n그리고 갈라타 타워 구경을 갔는데 여기는 석양을 보는 게 참 이쁘다고 했는데 4시 경인데도 불구하고 일요일 주말이라 그런지 사람이 너무 많아서 밖에서만 구경을 했다.  \n      \n갈라타 타워를 구경하지 못하는 게 아쉬워서 돌마바흐체 궁전 & 시계탑까지 30분 가량을 걸어갔다.\n근데 궁전은 또 돈내고 구경해야하는데 비슷비슷한 풍경일 거 같아서 그냥 주변에 있는 모스크나 들어가서 구경했다.  \n\n  \n그리고 오늘의 하이라이트 장소를 만났다. 돌마바흐체 궁전 쪽으로 가는 내내 무슨 공원이 있어서 한번 가보았는데 바다와 공원의 조화가 너무나 아름다웠고 평화로웠다.\n8만원짜리 톱카프 궁전은 저리가라 할 정도로 나에게 너무나 큰 만족감을 선사한 곳이었고, 이 곳에 살고 싶다는 생각이 처음으로 들게 만든 장소였다.  \n\n  \n그리고 자유롭게 날아다니는 새들을 보며 ‘나도 한마리 새가 되어 여기저기 자유롭게 날아다니고 싶다’는 생각을 하였다.  \n\n  \n물론 새가 너무 많다보니 하늘을 뒤덮을 정도이고 새똥을 맞지는 않을까 걱정이 되기도 했다.\n\n  \n그리고 신시가지에서 구시가지로 넘어가는 다리를 걸어가는데 주변에 바다가 있다보니 낚시꾼들이 참 많았고 하나의 관광상품처럼 보이기도 했다. (아마 낚시대도 빌려주지 않을까 싶다.)  \n  \n그리고 신기한 게 저렇게 거대한 모스크가 여기 저기 널려있다는 것이다.\n국민 대부분이 이슬람교(90% 이상으로 알고 있다.)를 믿다보니 모스크에 진심인 것 같았다.  \n  \n저녁을 먹으러 Osman Kasap이라는 식당에 왔다. 챗GPT가 추천해준 식당은 ‘Kasap Osman’이었는데 근처에 가니 호객행위도 하고 이름도 비슷해서 내가 가려는 곳인 줄 알았다. (Kasap Osman은 일요일에 영업을 안 해서 어차피 갈 수도 없었지만…)  \n  \n챗GPT가 추천해준 아이란을 먹어봤는데 요거트 맛이 좀 나기도 하고 좀 심하면 위액맛 같이 느껴지기도 했지만 그정도까지 느껴지지는 않았다.  \n  \n또 챗GPT가 추천해준 렌틸수프로 속 달래기 용으로 먹어봤는데 레몬을 넣기 전에는 괜찮았지만 레몬을 너무 많이 넣어서 시큼해서 많이 못 먹어서 아쉬웠다.  \n  \n그리고 거의 모든 식당에서는 이렇게 식전에 에크맥 빵을 주었다.  \n  \n또 챗GPT가 추천해준 요거트 케밥을 먹었는데 점심에 먹은 소고기 쾨프테마냥 너무 느끼했다. 요거트 때문에 더 니글니글 대는 거 같았고 내 스타일이 전혀 아니었다.\n소고기인지 양고기인지 고기 잡내도 조금 나는 거 같았고 이건 절반 가까이 남긴 것 같다.\n$16.75로 24,350원을 냈는데 이렇게 비싼 돈을 들이고도 만족스럽지 못한 식사를 못해서 화가 났다.\n하지만 현지에서만 할 수 있는 경험을 해야된다고 생각해서 비축해둔 육개장 사발면은 아껴두었다.\n    \n관광을 모두 마치고 숙소로 왔는데 욕조도 있고 피로를 풀기 좋아 매우 만족스러웠다.  \n2일차 (이스탄불 아시아지구(카디쿄이 + 위스키다르))\n    \n호텔에서 조식을 먹었는데 벌꿀이 진짜 자연 그대로 모습으로 돼있는 게 신기했고, 흰색 달걀도 되게 신기했다.\n\n  \n그리고 숙소 근처에 있는 에미네뉘 선착장(Eminönü iskele)에서 카디쿄이 선착장(Kadıköy iskele)으로 이동했다.  \n  \n이동하는 중에 공사중인 모스크를 봤는데 마치 한국에 교회처럼 모스크가 정말 많은 것 같았다.  \n  \n길냥이 천국답게 사람이 앉아있어야할 곳에 고양이가 앉아있는 모습도 볼 수 있다.  \n        \n그리고 진짜 시장다운 시장을 보아서 튀르키예의 전통시장은 이렇구나~ 하고 느낄 수 있었다.\n    \n점심은 챗GPT가 추천해준 Çiya Sofrası라는 식당에서 Tavuk Şiş라는 치킨 케밥을 먹었다.\n하나도 느끼하지 않았고 채소들도 다 내 스타일이었고(고수가 없어서 다행이다), 너무 맛있게 먹었다.\n닭고기가 그나마 제일 무난하고 나한테 맞는 거 같아서 앞으로 닭고기 요리만 먹어야겠다고 생각했다.\n점심은 $21.77(31,789원)이 들었지만 정말 아깝지 않고 맛있는 한끼를 먹은 것 같아 만족스러웠다.\n    \n모다 해변 공원을 산책하다보니 다양한 생활체육 시설이 보여서 여기도 정말 살기 좋은 것 같았다.  \n      \n이스탄불은 정말 동물의 왕국인 거 같았다. 나는 자연/동물파이다보니 어딜가나 보이는 동물을 환영했지만 동물을 싫어하는 사람은 다시 한 번 살기 힘들 거 같다는 생각이 들었다.\n그정도로 동물이 정말 많았다.\n    \n해변 공원이라 역시 경치는 끝내주었고 여기서도 한번 살아보고 싶었다.  \n  \n그리고 우리 동네에는 오랫동안 있던 공중전화를 최근에 철거했는데 이스탄불에 와서 공중전화를 보니 왠지 반가웠다.\n근데 튀르키예에서도 공중전화 사용율이 얼마나 되는지 궁금했다.\n  \n그리고 유럽에서는 화장실도 돈내고 가야한다고 들어서 항상 현금이 필수라고 들었는데 이제 세상이 변했는지 카드를 찍고 화장실을 갈 수 있는 세상이 되었다.  \n  \n카디쿄이 관광을 마치고 위스키다르로 가는 도중에 길가에 퍼질러 자는 강아지를 보았다.\n보통은 좀 모퉁이나 울타리에 붙어서 자는데 얘는 길 너무 한복판에 누워서 자길래 정말 팔자가 좋구나~ 싶었다.\n    \n그리고 이제 위스키다르로 가기위해 위스키다르 선착장으로 왔다.\n  \n페리를 타고 이동하는데 물살을 가르고 가는 풍경이 시원시원했다.\n    \n그리고 위스키다르 선착장에서 내리자마자 보이는 모스크를 구경왔는데 신발을 벗고 들어가다보니 밖에서 발을 닦는 사람들이 보여서 신기했다.\n\n  \n그리고 실내 뿐만 아니라 밖에서도 예배가 이루어지고 다른 곳에서 진행하는 예배 소리가 들리는 것도 신기했다.  \n    \n아마 Glow Juice라는 가게인 거 같은데 천연 착즙쥬스가 먹고 싶어서 간 곳인데 가성비도 좋고 맛도 너무 좋았다.\n사장님이 예전에 농구선수를 해서 한국에 왔었다고 하다보니 내적 친밀감도 생기는 거 같았다.\n  \n쥬스를 마시며 산책을 했는데 어느 공원이 보였고 어린이들이 뛰어노는 걸 보니 뭔가 뿌듯하고 사람사는 냄새가 나는 것 같았다.\n확실히 나는 관광지보다는 자연, 동물, 가족들이 모여있는 곳이 나하고 어울리는 것 같았다.\n    \n도심에는 고양이가, 해변에는 갈매기가 점령한 모습도 볼 수 있었다.\n  \n관광객들이 많다보니 노점들도 많았는데 익숙한 옥수수도 보이니 반가웠다. 근데 우리나라처럼 찌는 거보다는 더 노랗고 뭔가 탄 자국도 보여서 우리 방식이랑은 좀 달라보였다.  \n  \n그리고 모스크가 모두 거대한 게 아니고 그냥 일반 건물 안에 예배할 수 있는 곳도 존재했다.\n마치 우리나라 상가 건물 2층에 교회가 있는 그런 느낌이었다.\n  \n그리고 구시가지로 다시 복귀해서 저녁을 먹으러 Eminönü Balıkçısı로 왔다.\n이틀 연속 케밥을 먹다보니 이제 케밥은 질려서 다른 음식을 추천해달라고 하니 챗GPT가 생선은 비리지도 않고 느끼하지도 않다고 해서 에미네뉘 선착장 근처에 있는 식당을 추천해주었다.\n  \n챗GPT가 추천해준 생선수프를 먹었는데 너~~~~무너무 느끼하고 니글거렸다. 보기만해도 너무 기름졌고 레몬을 넣어도 간에 기별도 안 가는 느끼함이었다.  \n  \n그리고 밥도 없이 저런 반찬으로 생선을 먹으려니 얼마 들어가지도 않고, 기름투성이 수프랑 먹으려니 더더욱 별로였다…\n$20.23(29,535)라는 거금을 들이고 이런 식사를 하니 또 너무 화가났다.\n3일차 (이스탄불에서 파묵칼레로…)\n  \n이스탄불에서 마지막 조식을 했는데 흰 계란은 봐도봐도 신기하고 탁구공 같다는 생각이 들었다.\n      \n그리고 첫날 블루모스크를 보지 못한 게 아쉬워서 가서 내부도 간단히 구경을 했다.  \n  \n그리고 아야소피아도 내부에 일부 구역은 구경할 수 있지 않을까… 싶었는데 입장권이 없으면 내부를 전혀 볼 수 없는 구조라서 그냥 돌아왔다.  \n        \n그랜드 바자르라고 대형 시장이 있다고 해서 구경을 갔는데 굉장히 크고 블록 단위로 테마(옷, 그릇, 향신료 등등)이 있어서 구경하는 재미가 있었다. \n  \n그리고 그랜드 바자르를 나와서 다시 숙소로 돌아가는데 총포상 같은 게 보였다.\n우리나라는 총포상이라 할지라도 저렇게 밖에서 보이듯이 총을 전시하지는 않는데 여기는 총을 대놓고 판매하는 게 신기했다.\n    \n그리고 숙소에서 짐을 찾아 이스탄불 공항으로 가기 위해 Havaist 버스 정류장에 도착을 했다.\n근데 갑자기 거기에서 안내를 하는 아저씨가 나에게 오더니 몇시 비행기냐고 물어보았다. 왜 물어보는지 몰랐는데 다가오는 버스에 2자리 밖에 없고, 나보다 늦게온 2명이 비행기 시간이 촉박한 상황이었다.\n그래서 양보해달라는 눈치였고 나는 넉넉하게 나왔기 때문에 눈물을 머금고 양보해주었다. 원래는 공항에 가서 여유롭게 점심을 먹으려고 했는데 이제 공항에 가서 촉박할지 모르기 때문에 그냥 노점에 있는 군밤과 쥬스로 점심을 간단히 떼웠다.  \n  \n그리고 이스탄불 공항에 와서 아아를 마셨는데 무슨 8천원 가까이 하는 것이었다. 너무 비싸다는 생각이 들어서 어글리 코리안의 면모를 보여주었다.\n탑승까지 남은 시간동안 휴대폰/노트북을 충전하면서 콘센트를 두개나 차지했다.\n  \n파묵칼레로 가기 위해서는 데니즐리 공항을 가야했는데 국내선이라 그런지 1시간 10분 정도 밖에 걸리지 않았다.\n항공권은 5만원이 들었다.\n  \n근데 한시간 정도 밖에 가지 않는데도 기내식이 나와서 신기했다. 물론 간단한 샌드위치 형태로 나왔고, 물이 생수병이 아닌 요플레 같은 플라스틱 통에 담겨나오는 것도 신기했다.\n  \n파묵칼레로 가기 위해서는 데니즐리 공항에서 버스를 타고 데니즐리 오토가르(버스정류장)으로 갔다가 돌무쉬를 타고 파묵칼레로 가면 된다.\n아래 두 블로그 글이 큰 도움이 되었다.

(1박 2일 기준 조식포함 44,166원)\n저녁 늦게 도착하다보니 밖에 나가서 저녁을 먹기 애매해서 아껴뒀던 육개장 사발면을 먹어서 행복했다.  \n4일차 (파묵칼레 석회붕 + 히에라폴리스)\n    \n호텔에서 조식은 매우 고급스럽게 나왔고, 직접 가져다주셨다. 그리고 오므라이스를 원하면 얘기하라길래 한국식으로 볶음밥에 계란을 덮어주는 형태인 줄 알았는데 튀르키예에서는 그냥 계란후라이를 오므라이스라고 부르는 것 같았다.  \n  \n저녁에 못 본 풀장도 봤는데 너무 추워보여서 수영할 엄두는 나지 않았다. \n  \n그리고 열기구는 카파도키아 지역에서만 하는 줄 알았는데 파묵칼레에서도 열기구를 탈 수 있는 것 같았다.\n  \n숙소에서 조금만 가니 파묵칼레 석회붕이 나오기 시작했다.\n입장료를 내려고 하는데 클레오파트라 풀은 겨울이라 종료됐다고 해서 아쉬웠고, 무슨 무선 이어폰(+오디오 가이드)까지 포함한 풀패키지 밖에 없었던 것 같고 가격은 $45.95(68,297원)나 하였다.\n뭔가 상술에 당한 것 같아보였지만 톱카프 궁전에 비하면 선녀였고, 톱카프 궁전보다 만족도는 훨~~~~씬 높았다.\n  \n입장하자마자 귀여운 댕댕이가 있어서 반가웠다. 역시 튀르키예는 어딜가나 동물이 있는 것 같다.  \n  \n파묵칼레 석회붕 보호를 위해 맨발로 걸어 올라갔어야하는데 11월 아침이기도 했고, 해가 들지 않는 곳을 지나갈 때면 발이 너무 차가웠다.  \n\n  \n이렇게 물이라도 있는 곳은 너무 차가워서 진짜 숨참고 겨우겨우 지나갔다.\n    \n그래도 꼭대기로 올라오니 온천수가 나오는 것 같았고, 이쪽은 물이 따뜻해서 사람들이 제법 있었다.  \n    \n그래도 꼭대기로 오니 올라온 보람이 있을 정도로 경치가 정말 아름다웠다.\n  \n그리고 너무 발이 따갑다보니 네발로 걸어오고 그랬는데 그러다보니 손에 묻은 석회들로 인해 가방도 지저분해졌다.\n  \n꼭대기에는 귀여운 고양이가 물을 마시고 있었다.  \n이제 파묵칼레 석회붕을 모두 구경한 후에는 히에라폴리스 유적지 관광을 할 차례였다.\n사실 튀르키예에서는 히에라폴리스가 제일 기대됐다.  \n  \n마치 내가 중세시대 RPG 게임 속 주인공이 되어 맵을 돌아다니는 기분이 들 것만 같았다. (게임은 ‘킹덤 컴: 딜리버런스’이다.)  \n            \n예상은 적중했고, 그 시대 그대로 건축물들이나 흔적들이 남아있다보니 마치 내가 그 시대를 살아가는 듯한 느낌이 들어서 정말 재미있었다.  \n  \n원형극장은 정말 웅장했고, 가끔 여기서 음악 공연도 한다는데 라이브로 보면 정말 소름이 돋지 않을까 싶었다.\n조카들에게도 영상통화를 걸어서 보여주니 매우 신기해했고 나보고 여기저기 가보라고 시켜서 진짜 게임 케릭터가 된 듯한 느낌이었다.\n근데 히에라폴리스의 단점은 너무 커서 걸어서 돌아다니면서 보기에는 거리가 너무 멀다는 것이어서 시간이 촉박해서 엄청 여유롭게 보지는 못했다.\n그리고 거의 3만보 가까이 걸어서 다리가 아프기도 했다.  \n  \n그리고 유적지 안에 쓰레기와 속옷이 있는 것을 보았다. 이전에 케냐에서 같이 여행하던 일행 중에 이렇게 길가에 버려진 쓰레기를 보면 ‘What the fxxx’을 연발하던 에스토니아 사람이 있었는데 그 사람의 목소리가 들리는 것만 같았다.\n  \n관광을 모두 마치고 점심을 먹으러 왔는데 아래 블로그에서 추천해준 맛집이라서 와봤는데 너~~~무 내 취향이었다.  \n\n24 튀르키예 #33.

(2박 3일 기준 조식포함 238,262원)  \n또 저녁 늦은 시간이라 밖에서 저녁을 먹기는 애매하고, 육개장을 지금 또 먹기는 아깝고… 했는데 다행히 숙소에서 레스토랑을 운영한다고 했다.  \n    \n근데 올라와보니 식사보다는 술을 파는 분위기였고, 그나마 무난한 파스타를 하나 시켰다.\n맛은 뭐 그럭저럭이었는데 $21.01 (30,838원)으로 너무 비싸서 눈물이 났다.  \n5일차 (페티예 + 욜루데니즈)\n페티예는 패러글라이딩으로 유명하다고들 하는데 나는 단양에서 패러글라이딩을 한 번 해보기도 했고, 아저씨가 재밌는 거 보여준다고 하는데 바이킹처럼 위아래로 내려갔다 올라갔다를 반복해줬는데 나는 바이킹을 싫어해서 너무나 싫었다.\n그래서 이번에는 패러글라이딩을 타지 않기로 했다.  \n  \n어제 저녁을 먹었던 식당에서 아침을 먹었는데 퀄리티는 굉장히 좋았고, 자리에 앉으면 직접 가져다주었다.\n오이 때문에 방울토마토를 하나도 먹지 못한 게 아쉬웠다.\n  \n아침페 페티예 시장 산책을 나왔는데 열지 않은 가게들이 많이 보였다.  \n    \n그리고 보트투어 도시답게 캐리비안의 해적 컨셉으로 꾸민 배들이 보였다.\n나도 보트투어를 하고 싶었는데 내가 가는 시즌이 겨울 시즌이라고 운영을 하지 않아서 아쉬웠다.  \n  \n그리고 놀이터가 보여서 와봤는데 이렇게 길게 늘어져있는 게 처음에는 ‘단체로 타는 그네인가?’ 싶었는데 아마 저 줄을 밟고 건너는 것 같다.\n  \n그리고 튀르키예 아이스크림을 현지에서 느껴보고 싶어서 한번 시켜봤는데 이스탄불이 아니라 페티예라 그런지 그냥 담아서 줬다.\n맛도 뭐 그냥저냥 평범했다. 가격은 $4.75로 6,975원으로 좀 비싼 편이었다.  \n  \n\n  \n택시를 타고 페티예에서 욜루데니즈로 이동했다.\n해변은 아름다웠는데 탈의실이 어디있는지 몰라서 여기서는 구경만 했는데 겨울이고 오전이라 그런지 수영하는 사람이 거의 보이지 않았다.\n  \n그래서 돈내고 입장하는 블루라군에 왔다. (입장료는 $2.37로 3,500원 정도)\n\n  \n블루라군은 물고기 보는 재미도 있었다.\n혼자오고 좀 춥기도 하고 평상시 수영을 그렇게 즐기지도 않다보니 1시간 정도 있다보니 슬슬 지루해져서 나왔다.\n그리고 점심을 뭘 먹을까 고민하는데 한국말까지 써가며 적극적으로 호객행위하는 사장님이 있었다.\n튀르키예 식 피자인 피데인데 닭고기가 들어간 걸 먹고싶다고 하자 치킨 피자는 있다고 해서 뭐 비슷하겠거니 하고 갔다.  \n  \n맛을 봤는데 뭐 그냥 저냥… 한 2/3 정도만 먹을만한 맛이었다.\n보니까 메뉴판에도 치킨 피자라는 메뉴는 없는데 사장님이 장사하기 위해서 발로 뛰는 느낌으로 보였다.\n그리고 내가 한국인이라고 20%인가 15%인가를 할인해준다고 하였다.\n그리고 자신들이 할인을 해주기 때문에 은근 현금 유도를 하면서 카드 기계가 없다고 종업원이 그러길래 나도 카드 밖에 없다고 했다. (현금은 택시탈 때 써야해서 없다고 했다. 또 ATM 수수료를 물고 싶지 않았다.)\n그러니까 정말 현금이 없냐고 사장이 물어보더니 내가 진짜로 없다고 하자 마지못해 카드 기계에 전원을 키고 카드로 결제했다. ($11.87로 17,433원 정도에 먹었으니 적당한 가격에 먹은 것 같다.)\n  \n그리고 숙소로 돌아오는 길에 웨딩카를 보았다. 나는 혼자 이렇게 여행을 왔는데 누군가는 신혼여행을 오다니 참 부러웠다.\n  \n그리고 다음 행선지인 스페인 여행일정도 세우고 이제 튀르키예 음식이 질리기도 해서 저녁은 걸렀다.\n너무 배가 고파서 육개장의 유혹이 땡겼지만 한 국가마다 육개장은 하나씩만 먹는다는 규칙을 지키기 위해 참았다.\n페티예의 바다는 아침에 보면 너무 배가 많아서 징그러웠는데 밤에보니 보기 좋았다.  \n  \n이렇게 아침과 비교해보면 얼마나 꼴보기 싫은지 알 수 있게 된다.\n6일차 (스페인으로 떠나기)\n페티예는 더이상 크게 볼 것이 없기도 했고, 스페인에 낮에 도착해서 하루라도 더 관광하기 위해서 오전 10시 비행기를 잡았다.\n그러려면 오전 8시까지는 달라만 공항에 도착해야하고, 아침 일찍부터 움직여야하는데 대중교통으로 움직이면 불안해서 7시에 택시를 미리 예약해뒀는데 $61.5(90,254원)이나 들었다.\n지나고 보니 조식도 못먹고 택시비는 9만원씩이나 쓰고 너무 촉박하게 움직였던 것 같아 굳이 이렇게까지 했어야했나… 하는 생각이 들었다.  \n  \n챗GPT가 달라만 공항에 버거킹이 있을 거라고 해서 기대하면서 들어갔는데 버거킹은 없고 서브웨이만 있었다.\n근데 나는 샌드위치보다는 고기가 들어간 따뜻한 햄버거가 먹고 싶어서 햄버거도 파는 식당으로 갔다.  \n  \n혹시나 오이나 피클이 들어갈까봐 빼달라고 했는데 의미 전달이 잘못돼서 치킨 패티 빼고 다 빼주었다.\n그래서 채소나 과일이 하나도 없는 뻑뻑한 버거를 비싼돈($22.24로 32,727원) 주고 먹어야했다.\n감자튀김은 맛있었는데 메인인 햄버거가 너무 부실해서 어제 저녁 굶고 첫끼인데 내가 3만원이나 넘게 내고 이런 식사를 먹어야하나 화가 났다.  \n튀르키예 여행을 마치며\n튀르키예는 큰 기대를 하지 않았는데 자연과 동물 두가지를 다 챙긴 아주 실속있고 만족스러운 여행이었다.\n오히려 톱카프 궁전이나 블루 모스크처럼 각잡고 구경하는 곳보다 그냥 동네 공원이나 바다에서 새나 경치를 구경하는 게 훨~~~씬 좋았다.\n그리고 히에라폴리스도 진짜 내가 중세시대에 사는 듯한 느낌을 간접적으로 느끼게 해주어 좋았다.\n오히려 의도하고 계획을 세웠던 곳들보다 우연히 발견한 해변 공원들이 나를 더욱 행복하게 해준 걸 보면 항상 계획한 대로 되는 법은 없는 것 같다.",

        "content": "<hr>\n<h2 id=\"doing-the-right-thing-데이터-시스템-설계에서-옳은-일을-한다\">Doing the Right Thing: 데이터 시스템 설계에서 “옳은 일”을 한다</h2>\n<p>앞선 장에서는 데이터 시스템의 아키텍처를 비교하고, 신뢰성·확장성·유지보수성을 높이는 기법을 논의하였다. 그러나 기술적 논의만으로는 충분하지 않다. 모든 시스템은 목적을 가지고 만들어지며, 모든 행동은 의도한 결과뿐 아니라 의도하지 않은 결과도 낳는다. 엔지니어는 시스템이 사회에 미치는 영향을 고려하고, 어떤 세계를 만들고 싶은지에 대해 의식적으로 선택할 책임을 가진다.</p>\n<p>데이터는 추상적 대상처럼 보이지만, 실제로는 사람들의 행동·관심·정체성에 관한 데이터가 많다. 따라서 사람에 관한 데이터를 다룰 때는 인간 존엄과 존중을 최우선 가치로 두어야 한다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"기술은-선악이-아니라-사용-방식이-문제이다\">기술은 선악이 아니라 사용 방식이 문제이다</h3>\n<p>기술 자체가 선하거나 악한 것이 아니라, 그것이 어떻게 사용되고 사람에게 어떤 영향을 미치는지가 중요하다. 검색 엔진과 같은 소프트웨어도, 총과 같은 무기도 “사용과 결과”가 본질을 결정한다. 엔지니어가 기술만 바라보고 결과를 외면하는 태도는 충분하지 않으며, 윤리적 책임은 엔지니어에게도 존재한다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"예측-분석predictive-analytics은-개인의-삶을-직접적으로-바꾼다\">예측 분석(Predictive Analytics)은 개인의 삶을 직접적으로 바꾼다</h2>\n<p>날씨나 질병 확산을 예측하는 분석과 달리, 다음과 같은 예측은 개인의 삶에 직접 영향을 준다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>재범 가능성 판단</li>\n<li>대출 부도 가능성 판단</li>\n<li>보험금 청구 위험 판단</li>\n<li>채용에서의 “리스크” 판단</li>\n</ul>\n<p>조직은 위험 회피 관점에서 “의심스러우면 거절”을 선택하기 쉽다. 그러나 알고리즘이 개인을 “위험하다”고 라벨링하면, 그 사람은 반복적으로 거절당하며 사회 참여에서 배제될 수 있다. 이러한 체계적 배제는 개인의 자유를 크게 제한하며, “알고리즘 감옥(algorithmic prison)”이라고 불리기도 한다. 이는 죄가 증명되기 전까지 무죄를 전제로 하는 인권 원칙과 정면으로 충돌할 수 있다.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"편향과-차별-알고리즘은-공정함을-자동으로-만들지-않는다\">편향과 차별: 알고리즘은 공정함을 자동으로 만들지 않는다</h2>\n<p>알고리즘 판단이 인간 판단보다 반드시 공정하거나 불공정한 것은 아니다. 인간도 편향을 가지고 있으며 차별이 제도화될 수 있다. 데이터 기반 판단이 오히려 더 공정할 수 있다는 기대도 존재한다.</p>\n<p>그러나 예측 분석에서 규칙 자체를 데이터로부터 학습시키면 다음 문제가 발생한다.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>학습된 패턴이 불투명(opaque)하여 “왜 그렇게 판단했는지” 알기 어렵다.</li>\n<li>입력 데이터가 편향되어 있으면, 모델은 그 편향을 학습하여 <strong>증폭</strong>할 가능성이 높다.</li>\n<li>보호 특성(인종/성별/나이/장애/종교 등)을 직접 사용하지 않더라도, 우편번호·IP 주소 등은 보호 특성과 강하게 상관될 수 있어 사실상 대리 변수(proxy)가 된다.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>따라서 편향된 과거 데이터로부터 “공정한 미래”가 자동으로 만들어진다고 믿는 태도는 위험하다. 예측 모델은 과거를 외삽할 뿐이며,

        "contentSnippet": "Doing the Right Thing: 데이터 시스템 설계에서 “옳은 일”을 한다\n앞선 장에서는 데이터 시스템의 아키텍처를 비교하고, 신뢰성·확장성·유지보수성을 높이는 기법을 논의하였다. 그러나 기술적 논의만으로는 충분하지 않다. 모든 시스템은 목적을 가지고 만들어지며, 모든 행동은 의도한 결과뿐 아니라 의도하지 않은 결과도 낳는다. 엔지니어는 시스템이 사회에 미치는 영향을 고려하고, 어떤 세계를 만들고 싶은지에 대해 의식적으로 선택할 책임을 가진다.\n데이터는 추상적 대상처럼 보이지만, 실제로는 사람들의 행동·관심·정체성에 관한 데이터가 많다. 따라서 사람에 관한 데이터를 다룰 때는 인간 존엄과 존중을 최우선 가치로 두어야 한다.\n기술은 선악이 아니라 사용 방식이 문제이다\n기술 자체가 선하거나 악한 것이 아니라, 그것이 어떻게 사용되고 사람에게 어떤 영향을 미치는지가 중요하다. 검색 엔진과 같은 소프트웨어도, 총과 같은 무기도 “사용과 결과”가 본질을 결정한다. 엔지니어가 기술만 바라보고 결과를 외면하는 태도는 충분하지 않으며, 윤리적 책임은 엔지니어에게도 존재한다.\n예측 분석(Predictive Analytics)은 개인의 삶을 직접적으로 바꾼다\n날씨나 질병 확산을 예측하는 분석과 달리, 다음과 같은 예측은 개인의 삶에 직접 영향을 준다.\n재범 가능성 판단\n대출 부도 가능성 판단\n보험금 청구 위험 판단\n채용에서의 “리스크” 판단\n조직은 위험 회피 관점에서 “의심스러우면 거절”을 선택하기 쉽다. 그러나 알고리즘이 개인을 “위험하다”고 라벨링하면, 그 사람은 반복적으로 거절당하며 사회 참여에서 배제될 수 있다. 이러한 체계적 배제는 개인의 자유를 크게 제한하며, “알고리즘 감옥(algorithmic prison)”이라고 불리기도 한다. 이는 죄가 증명되기 전까지 무죄를 전제로 하는 인권 원칙과 정면으로 충돌할 수 있다.\n편향과 차별: 알고리즘은 공정함을 자동으로 만들지 않는다\n알고리즘 판단이 인간 판단보다 반드시 공정하거나 불공정한 것은 아니다. 인간도 편향을 가지고 있으며 차별이 제도화될 수 있다. 데이터 기반 판단이 오히려 더 공정할 수 있다는 기대도 존재한다.\n그러나 예측 분석에서 규칙 자체를 데이터로부터 학습시키면 다음 문제가 발생한다.\n학습된 패턴이 불투명(opaque)하여 “왜 그렇게 판단했는지” 알기 어렵다.\n입력 데이터가 편향되어 있으면, 모델은 그 편향을 학습하여 증폭할 가능성이 높다.\n보호 특성(인종/성별/나이/장애/종교 등)을 직접 사용하지 않더라도, 우편번호·IP 주소 등은 보호 특성과 강하게 상관될 수 있어 사실상 대리 변수(proxy)가 된다.\n따라서 편향된 과거 데이터로부터 “공정한 미래”가 자동으로 만들어진다고 믿는 태도는 위험하다. 예측 모델은 과거를 외삽할 뿐이며, 과거가 차별적이었다면 그 차별을 제도화한다. 더 나은 미래를 만들기 위해서는 인간의 도덕적 상상력과 의식적 개입이 필요하다. 데이터와 모델은 도구이지 주인이 아니다.\n책임과 설명 가능성: 누가 책임지는가\n자동화된 의사결정이 확산되면 책임과 설명 가능성 문제가 발생한다.\n인간이 실수하면 책임을 물을 수 있고 항소 절차가 가능하다.\n알고리즘이 실수하면 누가 책임지는지 불분명해진다.\n자율주행차 사고, 신용평가 알고리즘의 차별 등에서 책임 주체가 모호해진다.\n사법적 검토가 들어오면, 모델이 왜 그런 결정을 했는지 설명할 수 있어야 한다.\n전통적 신용점수는 대체로 “개인의 과거 상환 기록” 같은 관련 사실에 기반하며, 오류 수정의 가능성이 존재한다(절차가 어렵더라도). 반면 머신러닝 기반 평가는 입력이 훨씬 넓고 불투명하여, 특정 개인이 왜 불이익을 받았는지 확인하기 어렵고 부당 대우 여부도 판단하기 어렵다.\n또한 예측 분석은 종종 “당신은 과거에 무엇을 했는가”가 아니라 “당신과 유사한 사람들이 과거에 무엇을 했는가”에 근거한다. 이는 고정관념과 범주화(stereotyping)를 내포하며, 잘못된 범주에 배치된 개인에게는 구제가 어렵다. 예측은 본질적으로 확률적이므로, 전체적으로는 맞더라도 개별 사례에서 틀릴 수 있다. 따라서 데이터 기반 결정의 절대적 우월성을 믿는 태도는 위험하다.\n필요한 과제는 다음과 같다.\n알고리즘의 책임성과 투명성 확보\n편향 증폭 방지\n오류가 발생했을 때 수정 및 구제(recours) 메커니즘 구축\n데이터가 사람을 해치는 데

기존 격차를 증폭하는지, 불의를 완화하는지, 의도치 않은 결과는 무엇인지 점검해야 한다.\n프라이버시와 트래킹: 데이터 수집 자체의 윤리 문제\n사용자가 명시적으로 입력한 데이터를 저장·처리하는 시스템은 사용자를 위한 서비스를 수행하며, 사용자와 서비스의 관계가 비교적 명확하다. 반면 사용자의 활동이 “부수 효과”로 추적·기록되는 경우 관계는 달라진다. 서비스는 사용자가 시킨 일만 수행하는 것이 아니라, 자체 이해관계를 갖게 되며, 이는 사용자의 이해관계와 충돌할 수 있다.\n트래킹은 검색 품질 향상, 추천, A/B 테스트, UI 개선 등 사용자에게 이득을 주는 측면도 있다. 그러나 광고 기반 비즈니스 모델에서는 사용자가 아니라 광고주가 실질적 고객이 되며, 추적은 더 정교해지고 보유 기간이 길어지며, 개인 프로파일링이 강화된다. 이 관계는 “감시(surveillance)”로 볼 수 있다.\n감시(surveillance)라는 관점의 사고 실험\n“data”라는 단어를 “surveillance(감시)”로 치환하면, 평소 미화되던 표현이 다른 의미로 들린다. 대규모 감시 인프라가 사실상 구축되고 있으며, IoT의 확산은 마이크·센서가 상시 연결되는 환경을

어렵다.\n동의(consent)와 선택의 자유는 형식적으로만 존재할 수 있다\n이용약관과 프라이버시 정책에 동의했으므로 사용자가 자발적으로 선택했다고 주장할 수 있다. 그러나 다음 한계가 존재한다.\n사용자는 어떤 데이터가 수집되고 어떻게 결합·보존·처리되는지 충분히 알기 어렵다.\n프라이버시 정책은 이해를 돕기보다 은폐하는 방식으로 작성되는 경우가 많다.\n한 사람의 데이터는 다른 사람(서비스 비사용자)의 정보도 유추할 수 있어, 당사자의 동의만으로 충분하지 않다.\n데이터 제공과 서비스 제공의 교환은 상호 호혜적 협상 관계가 아니라, 서비스가 일방적으로 조건을 정한다.\n서비스가 사회 참여에 사실상 필수라면(네트워크 효과 포함), “사용하지 말라”는 선택지는 실질적 자유가 아니다.\n결국 감시에 동의하지 않는 사람에게 의미 있는 선택권이 없을 수 있으며, 감시는 특권층을 제외하면 회피하기 어려워진다.\n프라이버시는 비밀이 아니라 “결정권”이다\n“프라이버시는 죽었다”는 주장은 프라이버시 개념을 오해한 것이다. 프라이버시는 모든 것을 숨긴다는 뜻이 아니라, 무엇을 누구에게 공개할지 스스로 결정할 자유를 의미한다. 감시 인프라를 통해 데이터가

기반 모델에서는 행동 데이터가 사실상 핵심 자산이며, 사용자 서비스는 데이터 수집을 위한 수단으로 전락할 수 있다.\n데이터 브로커 산업은 개인 데이터를 구매·결합·추론·재판매한다.\n정부도 비공식 협력, 강제력, 법적 요구, 또는 탈취를 통해 데이터를 획득하려 한다.\n기업 파산 시 개인 데이터는 매각될 수 있다.\n데이터 유출은 빈번하며, 데이터는

TCP와 DB 트랜잭션만으로는 end-to-end 중복을 제거할 수 없다\n3.1. TCP의 중복 제거는 단일 연결 범위에서만 유효하다\nTCP는 시퀀스 번호를 이용하여 패킷 재전송 및 중복 제거를 수행한다. 그러나 이는 단일 TCP 연결 범위에서만 동작한다. 예를 들어, 클라이언트가 데이터베이스에 트랜잭션을 전송한 뒤 COMMIT을 전송했지만, 네트워크 단절로 인해 커밋 결과 응답을 받지 못한 경우를 생각할 수 있다. 클라이언트는 트랜잭션이 커밋되었는지 여부를 알 수 없으며, 재연결 후 동일 트랜잭션을 재시도할 가능성이 있다. 비멱등(non-idempotent) 연산이라면 결과가 중복 반영될 수 있다.\n3.2. 사용자(브라우저)–서버–DB 경로 전체에서 중복이 발생한다\nDB-클라이언트 구간에서 중복을 일부 억제하더라도, 사용자 단말(예: 브라우저)과 애플리케이션 서버 사이에서 동일 요청이 반복 제출될 수 있다. HTTP POST가 타임아웃되면 사용자는 재시도를 수행할 수 있으며, 서버 관점에서는 별도 요청으로, DB 관점에서는 별도 트랜잭션으로 인식된다. 이 경우 일반적인 중복 억제 메커니즘(TCP 수준, DB 연결 수준)은 충분하지 않다.\n4. 핵심 해법: 요청 ID를 end-to-end로 전달하여 중복을 억제한다\n중복 처리를 근본적으로 억제하려면 요청을 식별하는 Operation ID(요청 ID) 를 생성하고 이를 클라이언트에서 DB까지 end-to-end로 전달해야 한다.\n클라이언트는 요청마다 UUID 등 유일 식별자를 생성한다.\n요청 ID를 HTTP 요청 본문 또는 숨김 필드 등에 포함하여 서버로 전달한다.\n서버는 해당 요청 ID를 DB에 기록하고, DB는 request_id UNIQUE 제약 등을 통해 동일 요청이 2회 이상 반영되지 않도록 강제한다.\n이 방식은 요청 이벤트를 기록하는 테이블이 일종의 이벤트 로그(event log) 로 동작하도록 만들며, 이후의 상태(예: 잔액)는 이벤트로부터 파생될 수 있다.\n5. 종단 간 논증\n저수준 신회성 기능이 그 자체로 종단 간 정확성을 보장하기에 충분하지 않다.\nSaltzer, Reed, Clark(1984)의 End-to-End Argument는 다음 원칙을 제시한다.\n특정 기능(중복 제거, 무결성 검증, 암호화 등)은 통신 계층이나 저장 계층만으로 완전하고 정확하게 구현될 수 없으며, 끝단 애플리케이션의 지식과 협력이 필요하다.\n저수준 기능은 문제 발생 확률을 낮추는 데 유용하지만, end-to-end 정확성을 보장하는 충분조건은 아니다.\n따라서 트랜잭션, TCP, 메시징 시스템이 제공하는 신뢰성 기능을 활용하되, 애플리케이션 수준에서 end-to-end 정확성 요구사항을 직접 설계해야 한다.\n6. 제약 조건 강제하기\n유저명 중복 금지, 좌석 중복 예약 금지, 요청 ID 유일성 보장과 같은 유니크 제약은 분산 환경에서 본질적으로 합의를 요구한다.\n동시성 상황에서 여러 요청이 동일 값을 주장하면, 시스템은 어느 요청을 승인할지 결정해야 한다.\n일반적으로 단일 리더(leader)가 결정을 수행하게 하면 단순하지만, 리더 장애나 지리적 분산, 확장성 요구가 커지면 다시 합의 문제가 중요해진다.\n유니크 값을 기준으로 파티셔닝하면(예: username 해시) 같은 키의 요청이 동일 파티션으로 라우팅되도록 하여 처리량을 확장할 수 있다.\n7. 로그 기반 메시징의 유일성\n파티션 로그(예: Kafka)는 동일 파티션 내 메시지에 대해 소비자가 같은 순서를 관찰하게 한다. 이는 총순서(total order) 보장으로서 합의와 동등한 성질(총순서 브로드캐스트)로 이해할 수 있다. 이를 이용하면 유니크 제약 처리가 단순해진다.\n예시: username 선점 처리 흐름\nusername 요청을 메시지로 인코딩하여, username 해시 기반 파티션에 append한다.\n스트림 프로세서는 파티션을 단일 스레드로 순차 소비하며, 로컬 상태(예: 로컬 DB)에 점유 여부를 기록한다.\n사용 가능하면 성공 메시지를, 이미 점유된 경우 거절 메시지를 출력 스트림으로 발행한다.\n클라이언트는 출력 스트림에서 자신의 요청 결과를 관찰한다.\n핵심 원리는 충돌 가능성이 있는 쓰기들을 동일 파티션으로 모아 순차 처리함으로써 결정을 결정적이고 단순하게 만드는 것이다.\n8. 멀티 파티션 요청 처리\n예를 들어, \"이체 요청\"은 다음 파티션들과 관련될 수 있다.\n요청 ID 파티션\n출금 계좌(A) 파티션\n입금 계좌(B) 파티션\n전통적 DB 접근은 멀티 파티션 원자 커밋(예: 2PC)을 필요로 하며, 이는 처리량 및 운영 복잡도 비용을 동반한다. 데이터플로우 접근은 다음과 같이 분해하여 동등한 무결성을 달성한다.\n계좌 A에서 계좌 B로 송금하는 요청은 클라이언트에게 고유 요청 ID를 발급받아 요청 ID 기준으로 특정 로그 파티션에 추가된다.\n스트림 처리자는 요청 로그를 읽는다. 각 요청 메시지마다 보내는 사람 계좌 A의 출금 지시 메시지(A로 파티셔닝됨)와 받는 사람 계좌 B의 입금 지시 메시지(B로 파티셔닝됨) 두 가지를 출력 스트림으로 방출한다. 방출한 메시지에는 원 요청 ID가 포함된다.\n후속 처리자는 출금과 입금 지시 스트림을 소비해 요청 ID로 중복을 제거한 다음 변경 내용을 계좌 잔고에 반영한다.\n스트림 프로세서가 재시작되어 동일 이벤트를 재처리하더라도, 파생이 결정적이라면 동일 명령이 재발행될 뿐이며, 최종 반영 단계에서 요청 ID로 중복을 제거하면 무결성이 유지된다.\n9. 적시성과 무결성\n일관성이라는 용어는 서로 다른 요구를 혼합하여 혼란을 유발한다. 이를 다음 두 축으로 분리하여 해석한다.\n9.1. Timeliness(신선함/최신성)\n사용자가 최신 상태를 즉시 관찰하는 정도를 의미한다.\n복제 지연 등으로 인해 일시적 불일치가 발생할 수 있으나, 시간이 지나면 자연히 해소되는 성격을 가진다.\n9.2. Integrity(무결성)\n데이터 손실, 중복 적용, 모순 데이터, 잘못된 파생 데이터와 같은 “오염”이 없는 상태를 의미한다.\n한 번 무결성이 깨지면 기다린다고 복구되지 않으며, 명시적 검증과 수리가 필요하다.\n대부분의 애플리케이션에서 Integrity는 Timeliness보다 더 중요하다. 최신 반영이 늦어지는 것은 허용 가능한 경우가 많지만, 돈이 사라지거나 합계가 맞지 않는 오류는 치명적이다.\n10. 데이터플로우 시스템의 정확성\n스트리밍 기반 데이터플로우는 비동기 처리이므로 기본적으로 timeliness 보장이 약하다. 그러나 다음 조합을 통해 강한 무결성을 확보할 수 있다.\n쓰기를 단일 이벤트로 표현하여 원자적으로 기록한다.\n나머지 상태 업데이트는 이벤트로부터 결정적(Deterministic) 파생 함수로 계산한다.\n요청 ID를 end-to-end로 전달하여 중복 제거 및 멱등성을 확보한다.\n이벤트를 불변(Immutable)으로 유지하고 필요 시 재처리로 복구 가능하게 설계한다.\n이 조합은 분산 트랜잭션(2PC) 없이도 높은 무결성을 제공할 수 있는 유망한 방향이다.\n11. 느슨하게 해석되는 제약 조건\n엄격한 제약을 즉시 강제하려면 동기적 조정(합의/리더/선형화)이 필요하며 이는 성능 및 가용성 비용을 수반한다. 반면 많은 비즈니스는 다음과 같이 일시적 위반을 허용하고 사후 보정으로 해결할 수 있다.\n좌석 중복 예약: 한 명에게 사과하고 대체 좌석 또는 보상을 제공한다.\n재고 초과 판매: 입고 지연에 대해 사과하고 할인 등 보상을 제공한다.\n오버부킹: 환불, 업그레이드, 대체 제공 절차로 처리한다.\n즉, 제약 강제는 불일치로 인한 “사과”를 줄일 수 있으나, 시스템 성능 및 가용성을 낮춰 장애로 인한 “사과”를 늘릴 수 있다. 목표는 사과를 0으로 만드는 것이 아니라, 비즈니스에 적합한 균형점을 찾는 것이다.\n12. 믿어라, 하지만 확인하라\n앞선 논의는 어떤 장애는 발생할 수 있고(프로세스 크래시, 전원 장애, 네트워크 지연/드롭 등), 어떤 장애는 발생하지 않는다고(예: fsync 이후 데이터 유실 없음, 메모리 비트 오류 없음, CPU 연산은 항상 정확함) 가정하는 시스템 모델(system model) 위에서 진행된다. 이러한 가정은 대부분의 상황에서 타당하지만, 현실에서는 “가능/불가능”의 이분법이라기보다 확률의 문제로 이해하는 편이 정확하다. 즉, 매우 드문 사건이라도 규모가 커지면 실제로 발생할 수 있으며, 가정 위반이 실무에서 충분히 관측될 정도인지가 핵심이다.\n12.1. 하드웨어는 완벽한 추상화가 아니다\n디스크는 가만히 두어도 데이터가 조용히(silent) 손상될 수 있다.\n네트워크의 데이터 손상은 TCP 체크섬을 우회하는 경우가 발생할 수 있다.\n메모리의 무작위 비트 플립(bit-flip)은 매우 드물지만, 대규모 디바이스 환경에서는 관측될 수 있다.\n결함이 없는 메모리에서도 특정 접근 패턴으로 비트가 뒤집히는 현상이 보고되었으며(예: Rowhammer), 이는 운영체제 보안 메커니즘을 무력화하는 공격에도 활용된다.\n하드웨어 오류는 빈도가 낮더라도 “불가능”하지 않으므로, 시스템은 이를 완전히 배제하는 모델에만 의존해서는 안 된다.\n12.2. 소프트웨어 버그가 발생해도 무결성(integrity)유지하기\n하드웨어뿐 아니라 소프트웨어 버그는 더 빈번한 위험 요인이다. 네트워크/메모리/파일시스템의 체크섬은 소프트웨어 버그로 인한 잘못된 데이터 기록을 잡아내지 못한다.\n성숙한 DBMS조차 버그가 존재하며, 유니크 제약을 잘못 유지하거나(사례 존재), 직렬화 격리 수준에서 예상치 못한 이상 현상이 보고된 적이 있다.\n애플리케이션 코드는 DBMS보다 테스트/리뷰 강도가 낮은 경우가 많아, 버그 가능성이 더 높다.\n외래키/유니크 제약 등 DB가 제공하는 무결성 도구를 애플리케이션이 올바르게 사용하지 않는 경우도 많다.\nACID에서 말하는 “Consistency(일관성)”는 트랜잭션이 “일관된 상태에서 일관된 상태로” 시스템을 변환한다는 가정에 기반한다. 그러나 이는 트랜잭션(애플리케이션 로직)이 버그가 없다는 전제가 필요하며, 애플리케이션이 DB를 잘못 사용하면(예: 약한 격리 수준을 안전하지 않게 사용) 무결성은 보장되지 않는다.\n12.3. 약속을 맹목적으로 믿지 마라.\n하드웨어와 소프트웨어가 이상적으로 동작하지 않을 수 있다면, 데이터 손상은 언젠가 발생할 수 있다고 보는 편이 현실적이다. 따라서 중요한 것은 “손상이 없다고 믿는 것”이 아니라, 손상이 발생했는지 탐지하고 원인을 추적할 수 있는 메커니즘을 갖추는 것이다. 이러한 무결성 검증을 감사(auditing) 라고 한다.\n감사는 금융에만 필요한 개념이 아니며, 금융에서 특히 중요한 이유는 실수가 반드시 발생한다는 사실을 모두가 인정하기 때문이다.\n대규모 스토리지 시스템(HDFS, S3 등)은 디스크를 전적으로 신뢰하지 않고, 백그라운드에서 파일을 읽어 다른 복제본과 비교하거나 디스크 간 이동을 수행하여 조용한 손상(silent corruption) 위험을 완화한다.\n“데이터가 정말 존재하는지 확인하려면 읽어서 검사해야 한다”는 원칙이 성립한다.\n동일한 논리로 백업 복구 테스트를 주기적으로 수행해야 한다. 복구 테스트가 없다면, 백업이 깨졌다는 사실을 데이터 손실 이후에야 알 수 있다.\n12.4. 검증하는 문화\n많은 시스템은 정확성 보장을 절대적인 것으로 가정하고, 드문 데이터 손상 가능성을 고려한 자가 검증 체계를 갖추지 않는다. 그러나 앞으로는 다음과 같은 방향이 필요하다.\n시스템이 스스로 자신의 무결성을 지속적으로 점검하는 self-validating/self-auditing 메커니즘의 확산\nACID 문화가 만든 “트랜잭션을 믿으면 된다”는 습관에서 벗어나, 애플리케이션 설계 단계부터 감사 가능성(auditability) 을 투자 대상으로 포함\nNoSQL 확산과 약한 일관성, 그리고 성숙도가 낮은 저장 기술의 보편화는 “맹목적 신뢰” 전략을 더 위험하게 만들었다. 따라서 감사 가능성을 기반으로 한 설계가 중요해진다.\n12.5. 감사 기능 설계: 이벤트 기반이 유리하다\n여러 객체를 동시에 변경하는 트랜잭션은, 사후적으로 “왜 이런 변경이 일어났는지”를 해석하기 어렵다. CDC나 트랜잭션 로그를 확보하더라도, 여러 테이블의 INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE만으로는 의도(why) 와 맥락을 명확히 복원하기 어렵다. 또한 그 변경을 결정한 애플리케이션 로직 호출은 일회성(transient)이며 재현하기 어렵다.\n반면 이벤트 기반(event-based) 시스템은 감사 가능성 측면에서 장점이 있다.\n사용자 입력을 단일 불변 이벤트(immutable event) 로 기록한다.\n그 이벤트로부터 파생되는 상태 업데이트는 결정적(deterministic) 이고 반복 가능(repeatable)하도록 만든다.\n동일한 이벤트 로그와 동일한 버전의 파생 코드를 실행하면 동일한 결과가 재현된다.\n명시적인 데이터플로우는 데이터의 계보(provenance)를 선명하게 만들어 무결성 점검을 용이하게 한다.\n이벤트 로그는 해시(hash) 로 저장소 손상을 검증할 수 있다.\n파생 상태는 이벤트 로그로부터 재처리(reprocessing) 하여 동일 결과가 재현되는지 확인할 수 있다.\n필요하면 동일 파생을 중복 파이프라인으로 병렬 수행하여 결과를 상호 검증할 수도 있다.\n결정적 데이터플로우는 디버깅/트레이싱을 단순화하며, 문제 상황을 재현하는 시간 여행 디버깅(time-travel debugging) 성격의 진단 능력을 제공한다.\n12.6. 다시 종단 간 논증: 무결성 검증도 end-to-end가 최선이다\n개별 컴포넌트(디스크, 네트워크, 서비스, 알고리즘)가 완전히 무결하다고 신뢰할 수 없다면, 데이터 무결성은 주기적으로 점검해야 한다. 점검이 없다면 손상은 downstream에서 피해를 만든 뒤에야 드러나며, 그 시점에는 원인 추적 비용이 크게 증가한다.\n무결성 점검은 가능한 한 end-to-end 로 수행하는 것이 바람직하다.\n검증 범위에 더 많은 시스템을 포함할수록, 어떤 단계에서 손상이 “조용히” 지나갈 여지가 줄어든다.\n파생 데이터 파이프라인 전체를 end-to-end로 검증할 수 있다면, 경로 상의 디스크/네트워크/서비스/알고리즘이 암묵적으로 검증 범위에 포함된다.\n연속적인 end-to-end 무결성 검증은 신뢰도를 높이고, 이는 곧 변경에 대한 두려움을 줄여 시스템 진화를 빠르게 만든다. 이는 자동화 테스트가 변경 리스크를 낮추는 것과 같은 효과를 가진다.\n12.7. 감사 가능한 데이터 시스템용 도구: 암호학적 검증의 가능성\n현재 많은 데이터 시스템은 감사 가능성을 1급 요구사항으로 두지 않는다. 애플리케이션이 별도 감사 테이블에 변경 로그를 남길 수는 있으나, 감사 로그와 실제 DB 상태의 무결성을 동시에 보장하기는 여전히 어렵다. 트랜잭션 로그를 HSM으로 서명해 위변조를 방지할 수 있으나, “처음부터 올바른 트랜잭션이 기록되었는지”까지 보장하기는 어렵다.\n이 영역에서 암호학적 도구가 흥미로운 가능성을 제공한다.\n블록체인/분산 원장 기술은 “서로 신뢰하지 않는 조직”이 운영하는 복제본들이 서로를 검증하며, 합의 프로토콜로 실행할 트랜잭션을 결정하는 분산 DB로 이해할 수 있다.\n비잔틴 장애 허용(Byzantine fault tolerance) 측면과 작업 증명(Proof of Work)의 비용 문제, 처리량 한계 등에 대한 비판적 논의가 존재하더라도, 무결성 검증 아이디어는 주목할 가치가 있다.\n암호학적 감사는 종종 머클 트리(Merkle tree) 를 활용하며, 이는 특정 레코드가 데이터셋에 포함됨을 효율적으로 증명하는 데 사용된다.\n암호학적 감사 기법은 인증서 투명성(certificate transparency)처럼 이미 보안 영역에서 실전 적용 사례가 있으며, 향후 데이터 시스템 전반으로 확산될 가능성이 있다.\n암호학적 감사의 성능 오버헤드를 낮추고 대규모 시스템에서도 확장 가능하게 만드는 추가 연구가 필요하나, 장기적으로 주목할 만한 방향이다.\n결론\n데이터 시스템의 강한 보장은 end-to-end 정확성을 자동으로 제공하지 않는다.\n요청 ID 기반 end-to-end 중복 억제, 불변 이벤트, 결정적 파생, 중복 제거의 조합은 분산 트랜잭션 없이도 강한 무결성을 달성할 수 있다.\n엄격한 제약은 필요한 지점에 국소적으로 적용하고, 나머지는 느슨한 제약과 사후 보정 프로세스로 설계하는 전략이 실용적일 수 있다.\n참고\n데이터 중심 애플리케이션 설계 12장",

NoSQL처럼 OS와 DBMS의 장점을 결합하기를 바란다.\n모든 것의 메타데이터베이스\nDBMS가 생성하는 인덱스는 사실 파생 데이터의 일종으로 추상화해서 생각할 수 있다. 이렇게 생각하면 지금까지 파생 데이터로 구성한 전체 조직의 데이터플로 자체가 하나의 DBMS처럼 추상화해서 볼 수 있다. 예를 들어, 일괄 처리와 스트림 처리는 DBMS의 트리거와 스토어드 프로시저로 매핑해서 생각하는 것이다.\n파생 데이터 시스템 아키텍처가 등장하면서 이런 도구를 하나로 통합된 데이터베이스 제품의 기능으로 구현하지 않고, 여러 장비에서 실행되고 여러 팀에서 관리하는 다양한 소프트웨어를 사용해 제공한다. 서로 다른 저장소와 처리 도구를 사용하지만 하나의 응집된 시스템으로 구성할 수 있는 두 가지 길이 존재한다.\n연합 데이터베이스: 읽기 통합\n엄청나게 많은 하단 저장소 엔진과 처리 메서드를 통합해 질의하는 인터페이스.\n언번들링 데이터베이스: 쓰기 통합\n단일 데이터베이스 내에서 일관된 색인을 생성하는 것은 내장된 기능이다. 여러 시스템으로 구성됐을 때도 마찬가지로 변경된 모든 데이터가 올바른 장소에 반영되도록 보장해야 한다. 저장소 시스템들을 신뢰성 있게 결합하기 쉽게 만드는 것은 데이터베이스의 색인 유지 기능을 다른 기술에 걸친 쓰기를 동기화할 수 있는 방식으로 언번들링 하는 방식과 유사하다.\n언번들링 접근법은 하나만 잘하는 작은 도구를 사용하는 유닉스 전통을 따른다. 이 도구들은 통일된 저수준 API를 통해 통신한다.\n언번들링이 동작하게 만들기\n읽기 통합은 어렵지 않으니 쓰기 통합에 집중해보자. 쓰기를 동기화하는 전통적인 접근법은 이종 저장소 시스템 간 분산 트랜잭션이 필요하다. 마틴은 이 방법이 잘못된 해결책이라 생각한다. 단일 저장소나 스트림 처리 시스템에서 트랜잭션은 쓸 만하다. 하지만 데이터가 다른 기술 사이의 경계를 오간다면 멱등성을 기반으로 쓰기를 수행하는 비동기 이벤트 로그를 사용하는 편이 훨씬 더 강력하고 현실적인 접근법이라 본다.\n로그 기반 통합의 큰 장점은 다양한 구성 요소 간 느슨한 결합이다.\n시스템 수준에서 비동기 이벤트 스트림을 사용하면 전체 시스템이 개별 구성 요소의 장애나 성능 저하가 생겨도 잘 견디게 만들 수 있다.\n인적 수준에서 데이터 시스템을 언번들링하면 소프트웨어 구성 요소와 서비스를 다른 팀에서 각자 개발하고 개선하고 독립적으로 유지보수할 수 있다.\n언번들링 vs 통합 시스템\n언번들링이 실제로 미래에 사용될 방법이라고 가정해도 현재 형태의 데이터베이스를 대체하지는 못할 것이다. 데이터베이스는 여전히 스트림 처리자의 상태를 유지하기 위해 필요하고, 전문화된 질의 엔진은 특정 작업부하에 쓰는 용도로 여전히 중요하다.\n여러 다른 인프라에서 수행하는 복잡성도 문제다. 각 소프트웨어마다 학습 곡선과 설정 문제, 그리고 운영상에서만 나타나는 특성이 있다. 따라서 동적 부분을 가능하면 적게 배포해야 유리하다. 단일 통합 소프트웨어 제품은 설계된 용도에 맞춰 사용하면 애플리케이션 코드로 연결한 여러 도구로 구성된 시스템보다 뛰어나고 예측 가능한 성능을 낼 수 있다.\n필요하지도 않은 확장성을 고려해 시스템을 구축하는 노력은 전적으로 낭비일 뿐더러 유연하지 못한 설계에 갇힐 수 있다. 사실상 이것은 성급한 최적화의 한 형태다.\n필요한 모든 것을 만족하는 단일 기술이 있다면 저수준 구성 요소로부터 직접 재구현하려 하지말고 그냥 해당 제품을 사용하는 것이 좋다. 언번들링과 합성의 장점은 요구사항을 모두 만족하는 단일 소프트웨어가 없는 상황에서만 드러난다.\n미분 데이터플로(differential dataflow)란\n입력이 계속 바뀌는 상황에서(스트리밍 업데이트) + 반복(iteration)이 있는 계산(그래프/ML 등)을 전체 재계산 없이 변화분만 전파해서 결과를 유지하는(incremental maintenance) 계산 모델/실행 기법\n직관적으로는 각 연산자 f에 대해 입력이 A → A + a, B → B + b로 바뀌었을 때, 출력 변화는 δz = f(A+a, B+b) − f(A, B) 꼴로 계산/전파(실제로는 키별 인덱스/상태를 유지해 변화가 영향 주는 부분만 빠르게 처리). 이 때문에 큰 데이터 전체를 다시 돌리는 대신, 보통 변경된 키/레코드 주변만 영향.\n실행 관점에서 보면 처리됨 vs 미처리 δ 두 덩어리를 굴리는 것으로, Naiad 기반 differential 모델(초기 문서/리포트들)에서는 각 엣지가 이미 반영된 δ와 아직 반영 안 된 δ를 나눠 들고 있다가, 연산자가 미처리 δ를 조금씩 가져와 처리하고, 그에 대응하는 출력 δ를 내보내는 식으로 전체가 수렴. 업데이트가 들어오면 다시 미처리 δ가 쌓이고, 그 부분만 연쇄적으로 갱신.\n데이터플로 주변 애플리케이션 설계\n현대 데이터 시스템은 내결함성과 확장성이 있어야 하고 지속성 있게 데이터를 저장해야 한다. 또 데이터 시스템은 시간이 흐름에 따라 다른 그룹의 사람들이 개발한 이종 기술과도 통합이 가능해야할 뿐 아니라 이미 존재하는 라이브러리와 서비스를 재사용 가능해야한다.\n이런 아이디어를 확장해 언번들링 데이터베이스와 데이터플로의 아이디어 주변에서 애플리케이션을 구축하는 몇 가지 방법을 탐구한다.\n애플리케이션 코드와 상태의 분리\n마틴은 시스템의 일부는 지속성 있는 데이터 저장을 전문으로 하고 다른 일부는 애플리케이션 코드 실행을 전문으로 하는 게 합리적이라 생각한다. 두 부분이 독립적이라도 여전히 상호작용할 수 있다.\n오늘날 대부분의 웹 어플리케이션이 상태 비저장 서비스로 배포된다. 상태 비저장 서비스 내에서 사용자 요청은 어떤 애플리케이션 서버로도 라우트될 수 있다. 그리고 응답 결과를 보내고 난 요처에 대해서는 완전히 잊어버린다. 이런 배포 양식은 원할 때마다 서버를 추가하고 제거하기에 매우 편리하다. 요즘 추세는 상태 관리와 상태 비저장 애플리케이션 로직을 분리하는 것이다.\n데이터플로: 상태 변경과 애플리케이션 코드 간 상호작용\n데이터플로 측면에서 애플리케이션을 생각한다는 것은 애플리케이션 코드와 상태 관리 간의 관계를 재조정한다는 의미다. 데이터베이스를 애플리케이션이 직접 조작하는 수동적 변수로 취급하는 대신 상태와 상태 변경, 그리고 상태를 처리하는 코드 간의 상호작용과 협동에 관해 좀 더 생각해 볼 수 있다.\n요약하자면 데이터베이스를 언번들링할 것이고 원본 데이터베이스 외부인 애플리케이션 레벨에서 파생 데이터를 다루겠다는 것이다.\n가장 명심해야 할 점은 파생 데이터를 유지하는 것이 전통적인 메시징 시스템의 설계 목적인 비동기 작업 실행과는 같지 않다는 것이다. 안정적인 메시지 순서화와 내결함성이 있는 메시지 처리를 해야한다. 이 요구 사항은 상당히 엄격하지만 분산 트랜잭션보다 훨씬 저렴하면서 탄탄한 운영을 가능하게 한다.\n이 애플리케이션 코드로 데이터베이스에 내장된 파생 함수가 지원하지 않는 임의 처리가 가능하다. 파이프로 연결한 유닉스 도구와 같이 스트림 처리자를 구성해서 데이터플로를 중심으로 대형 시스템을 구축할 수 있다. 각 연산자는 상태 변경 스트림을 입력으로 받아 다른 상태 변경 스트림을 출력으로 생산한다.\n스트림 처리자와 서비스\n스트림 연산자로 데이터플로 시스템을 구성하는 것은 마이크로서비스 접근법과 유사하다. 하지만 기반이 되는 통신 메커니즘은 매우 다르다. 마이크로서비스 접근법은 동기식 상호작용을 사용하지만 스트림 연산자로 구성한 시스템은 단방향 비동기식 메시지 스트림을 사용한다.\n예를 들면, 한 소비자가 특정 통화로 가격이 매겨진 상품을 구매했지만 지불은 다른 통화로 했다고 가정하자.\n마이크로서비스 접근법에서 구매 처리 코드는 특정 통화의 현재 환율을 얻기 위해 환율 서비스나 데이터베이스에 질의한다.\n데이터플로 접근법에서 구매 처리코드는 미리 환율 갱신 스트림을 구독하고 환율이 바뀔 때마다 로컬 데이터베이스에 환율을 기록한다. 구매 처리가 들어올 때 단지 로컬 데이터베이스에 질의하면 된다.\n상태 변경을 클라이언트에 푸시하기\n웹 브라우저에 일반적인 웹 페이지 하나가 로드된 후 서버에서 데이터가 변경된다면 페이지가 새로 로드될 때까지 브라우저는 해당 변경 사항을 알 수 없다. 따라서 명시적으로 변경 사항을 폴링하지 않으면 장치의 상태는 갱신되지 않는 신선도가 떨어지는 캐시다.\n많은 최신 프로토콜이 HTTP의 기본적인 요청/응답 패턴을 벗어나고 있다. 웹브라우저가 서버와 TCP 접속을 유지하면서 연결이 유지되는 동안 서버가 주도적으로 메시지를 브라우저에 보내는 방식의 통신 채널을 제공한다. (예를 들면 서버 알림)\n장치가 얼마 동안 오프라인이라서 그 시간 동안 서버에서 상태 변경 알림을 받지 못할 수 있다. 그러나 이 문제는 '소비자 오프셋'을 통해 이미 해결할 수 있다. 각 장치는 작은 이벤트 스트림을 구독하는 작은 구독자다.\n그럼 왜 모든 애플리케이션을 이런 방식으로 구축하지 않을까? 문제는 상태 비저장 클라이언트와 요청/응답 방식의 상호작용이 데이터베이스, 라이브러리, 프레임워크, 프로토콜에 뿌리 깊게 배어 있기 때문이다. 쓰기 경로를 최종 사용자까지 확장하려면 근본적으로 시스템을 구축하는 방식을 재고할 필요가 있다. 즉 요청/응답 상호작용 방식에서 발행/구독 데이터플로 방식으로 변경해야한다는 의미다. 좀 더 반응성 있는 사용자 인터페이스를 지원하고 더 나은 오프라인 지원을 하기 위해 들이는 노력이 가치 있다고 생각한다. 데이터 시스템을 설계한다면 변경 사항을 구독하는 방식을 염두에 둬야 한다고 생각한다.\n참고\n데이터 중심 애플리케이션 설계 12장\n텀블링 윈도우란\nhttps://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2013/Papers/CIDR13_Paper111.pdf\n###",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "어느 날 사무실에서 새로운 창업가와 첫 미팅을 하는 도중, 미팅 룸을 둘러보면서 다른 팀 동료분들을 봤다. 모두 다 귀는 창업가의 발표를 들으면서, 눈은 대형 화면의 발표 자료, 창업가의 얼굴, 그리고 각자의 노트북 모니터를 왔다 갔다 하고 있었고, 손가락으로 열심히 미팅 노트를 적고 있었다. 어떤 분들은 AI 노트 테이킹 앱으로 대화 내용을 녹음하면서 요약하고 있었다.\n그런데 더 자세히 보면, 딴짓하는 분들도 내 눈에 띄었다. 각자의 노트북 화면을 내가 볼 순 없었지만, 분명히 다른 이메일 답장을 하거나, 슬랙을 하거나, 또는 그날 저녁 친구들과의 모임에서 어떤 음식을 먹을지에 대해서 단톡방에서 개인적인 대화하는 걸 느낄 수 있었다. 물론, 딴짓하는 걸 창업가에게 최대한 들키지 않게 열심히 연기를 하고 있었지만, 그 누가 봐도 미팅 도중에 그 미팅 내용과는 다른 일을 하고 있다는 걸 알 수 있었다. 내가 그걸 느낄 수 있다면, 우리의 건너편에서 우리를 보면서 열심히 사업 내용을 설명하는 창업가는 이걸 100% 알아차렸을 것이다.\n나는 미팅할 때, 아예 노트북을 지참하지 않는다. 종이와 볼펜만 미팅룸에 가져가고, 완전 옛날 방식으로 종이 위에 펜으로 내 손으로 직접 글씨를 쓴다. 내가 듣는 내용도 정리하고 요약해서 쓰고, 중간마다 그 창업가에 대해서 느낀 점들도 펜으로 다 적는다.\n내가 아직도 종이와 펜을 고집하는 데는 여러 가지 이유가 있는데, 가장 대표적인 이유 두 가지는 다음과 같다.\n일단 손으로 글씨를 쓰는 행위 자체는 그 내용을 확실하게 기억에 새기고, 또 마음에도 새기는데 가장 탁월한 암기 방법이다. 이걸 과학적으로 증명한 여러 가지 연구가 있고 논문도 있는데, 이렇게 뇌과학적으로 파고 들어가지 않아도 이 현상을 나는 손으로 글씨를 쓰면서 매일매일 몸으로 체감하고 있다. 상대방의 이야기를 귀로 듣고, 뇌로 처리하고, 손으로 쓰고, 쓰면서 다시 눈으로 보고 읽으면서 뇌로 한 번 더 정리하는 이 행위는 인간을 가장 인간답게 만드는 대단한 능력이자, AI가 아무리 발달해도 항상 지키고 개선하고 싶은 습관이다. 어쨌든 손으로 종이 위에 펜으로 필기하는 게 나에게는 가장 효과적인 미팅 노트테이킹 방법이다.\n두 번째 이유는 상대방에 대한 예의 때문이다. 나보다 내 앞의 사람이 말을 훨씬 더 많이 하는 우리가 주로 하는 창업가와의 미팅에서, 발표하는 사람의 건너편에 앉은 우리 앞에 있는, 인터넷에 연결된 노트북은 딴짓하는 걸 잘 감춰주는 최고의 도구이다.\n아마도 우리 모두 이런 경험이 있을 것이다. 내가 더 아쉽고 부탁할 게 많은 미팅인데, 미팅룸에서 다들 노트북이나 스마트폰을 들여다보는 사람들로부터 테이블의 건너편에 앉아서, 나는 정말 열과 성의를 다해 죽어라 이야기하는데, 내 건너편 사람들이 실제로 미팅 메모를 적는 건지, 아니면 쿠팡에서 쇼핑하는 건지 궁금해한 적이 있을 것이다. 펜, 종이, 그리고 필기는 나와 만나는 상대방이 제대로 주목받고 있고, 내 관심을 100% 받고 있다는 느낌을 완벽하게 줄 수 있다. 상대방이 말할 때, 나는 그들이 말하는 걸 내가 집중해서 듣고 있고, 그들이 말하는 걸 내가 요약하고 있다는 걸 확실하게 알려주고 싶고, 이걸 가장 잘 전달할 방법은 그들과 계속 아이컨택트를 하면서 펜으로 종이에 미팅 내용을 적는 것이다.\n11월 말에 나는 올해의 마지막 해외 출장을 다녀왔다. 처음 만나는 잠재 투자자와 미팅했는데, 미팅에 참석한 두 명 모두 본인들 노트북으로 딴짓하는 게 너무나 명확했던, 정말 짜증 나는 1시간이었다. 나는 열심히 준비한 내용을 거의 목이 쉴 정도로 열정적으로 샤우팅 하고 있는데, 내 앞에 있는 사람들은 내 말을 듣는 척 연기하면서, 마치 내 이야기를 노트북에 타이핑하는 척했지만, 모두 경험이 있겠지만, 이게 금방 티가 나고 들키게 된다. 솔직히, 성질 같아서는 그 노트북을 엎어버리고 딴짓하려면 꺼지라고 하고 싶었다. 물론, 아쉬운 게 나라서 그렇게 하진 않았지만. 하지만, 내가 저런 사람들에게 출자받고 앞으로 10년 동안 – 펀드의 만기가 10년이다 – 좋은 관계를 맺고 싶을지 잘 모르겠다. 그분들과 한 시간 미팅을 위해서 나는 6시간 동안 비행기를 타고 한국에서 왔고, 그걸 뻔히 알고 있는 사람들이 미팅 시간 내내 이메일 확인하고, 슬랙 보내고, 친구들과 금요일 저녁 어디서 만날까 왓츠앱 하는 걸 생각해 보면, 벌레 같은 인간들이라는 생각이 들기도 했다.\n스트롱 팀동료들도 창업가와 미팅할 때 노트북으로 노트테이킹을 하는데, 전에 내가 한 번 미팅 시간에 노트북으로 딴짓할 정도로 다른 중요한 일이 있으면, 미팅에 아예 들어오지 말라고 한 적이 있다. 이건 우리와 미팅하는 창업가들에 대해 우리가 보여줄 수 있는 최소한의 예의다. 다시 한번 반복하지만, 그냥 예의도 아니고, 최소한의 예의다. 어떤 분들은 미팅하면서 그 회사의 사업과 관련된 내용을 계속 검색하는데, 이건 그 누구에게도 도움이 안 되는 행동이고, 이런 건 미팅 전에 이미 조사해서 준비해 왔어야 하는 내용이다. 이런 식으로 미팅하게 되면, 상대방의 이야기는 전혀 머리에 안 들어오고, 서로 1시간을 낭비하게 되고, 그 창업가는 내가 위에서 느꼈던 것처럼 우리를 벌레 같은 VC라고 생각할 것이다. \n우리는 AI가 노트테이킹을 다 해주고, 다 요약해 주고, 그다음에 뭐를 할지까지 알려주는 좋은 세상에 살고 있지만, 그럴수록 내 생각을 손으로 종이에 직접 쓰는 걸 나는 강력하게 권장한다. 앞으로 이건 더욱더 중요해질 것이고, 어쩌면 펜으로 종이에 뭔가를 쓰면서 내 기억력을 글씨로 요약하는 행위는 나만의 엄청난 해자(垓字)가 될지도 모른다.",

돈! 돈이었다. 더구나 조선 후기에는 한양에 인구가 집중되면서 집값이 크게 올랐고 물가도 매우 높았으니 요즘 대학생들의 하숙비처럼 부담되었을 것이다. 노상추의 경우 무려 14년간 과거시험을 준비해야했고 이 기간 동안 노상추는 가족을 부양해야 했다.\n왜 우리는 시험에 매달리는가\n과거 시험에 모든 것을 쏟아붓던 조선 시대의 풍경은 지금 상상해도 놀랍다. 정약용은 《경세유표》에서 당시 향시(鄕試)의 실태를 이렇게 비판했다. “부잣집 자식은 입에 아직 비린내가 나고 정(丁)자도 모르면서 거벽(巨擘)의 글을 빌리고, 사수(寫手)의 글씨를 빌려 시권을 바친다. 향시(鄕試)가 이 모양이니 경시(京試)도 다르지 않을 것이다. 회시에서는 사람을 사서 대신 들여보내어 짓고 쓰며, 위조하고, 세력 있는 자와 통한다.”\n거벽은 문장에 능한 사람, 사수는 글씨에 능한 사람을 뜻한다. 향시는 고향에서 보는 1차 시험, 회시는 서울에서 보는 2차 시험, 경시는 서울에서 보는 시험이기 때문에 별시나 전시를 이야기한 듯 하다. 과거를 합격하려면 최소 3번을 합격해야 하는데, 그중 2번의 시험을 서울에서 치렀다.\n정약용의 글을 따라 상상해 보시라. 아무것도 모르는 귀한 집 자식이 앉아 있고, 그 옆에서 거벽이 문제를 분석해 “이렇게 쓰시오.” 하면, 한문을 잘 쓰는 사수가 좋은 필체로 내용을 적어주는 풍경을 말이다. 과거 시험장에도 당연히 감독관이 있었지만 명문가 도련님이 왔기 때문에 ‘불법을 막아야 하는 금란관은 머리를 감싸고 숨을 곳을 찾았다’라고 정약용은 고발하고 있다.\n조선 후기 입시 경쟁은 시간이 갈수록 격화되었다. 15세기 소과시험*합격자의 평균 연령은 25세. 하지만 19세기 후반이 되면 37세로 오른다. 문과 최종 합격자의 경우 조선시대 평균이 36세인데, 18세기 후반이 되면 40세에 이르렀다. 응시자 수 역시 폭발적으로 증가했다. 세종 때 1,000여 명이던 한성시** 응시자는 선조 때 2,000명, 인조 때 4,000명, 1707년 숙종 33년에는 무려 11,000명까지 늘었다. 세도정치기 때는 평균 5~6만 명, 고종 때는 무려 11만 명이 되었다. 물론 500년간의 이야기이고 인구성장, 합격 인원의 증가 등 변동 요소를 고려해야겠지만 그럼에도 불구하고 전반적으로 과거시험은 지나치게 비대해지고 있었다.\n*향시, 고향에서 보는 1차 시험\n**한성에서 치루던 문과·무과·생원진사시의 1차 시험\n상황이 이러니 기이한 기록도 등장한다. 영조 때 이요팔은 81세, 신수채는 84세에 과거에 합격했다. 개인과 가문에는 경사였을지 모르지만, 이들은 사실상 평생을 과거시험에 매달렸으며, 합격의 영예를 누리긴 했지만 실질적인 관직을 얻지는 못했다. 조선 후기가 되면 3대가 함께 과거시험 공부를 했다는 이야기도 거짓이 아니었다.\n경쟁이 심해지자 온갖 부정이 횡행했고, 황당한 사건도 벌어졌다. 조선 후기 학자 이옥은 《유광억전》을 남겼는데, 여기에는 ‘영남 제일의 인재’라 불리던 사람이 대필 시험으로 생계를 이어가다 결국 들켜 자결했다는 내용이 실려 있다. 부정행위가 발각되어, 흔히 곤장으로 알고 있는 장형을 받는 사례도 부지기수였다. 시험에 목숨을 걸고, 부정에 손을 대고, 들키면 또 목숨을 내놓아야 하는 시대였다.\n왜 조선 시대 사람들은 이렇게까지 과거시험에 매달렸을까. 양반 중심 사회에서 과거 합격만이 신분 상승의 거의 유일한 통로였기 때문이다. 14년간 무과 시험에 도전한 노상추 역시 마찬가지. 무관이 된다는 것은 양반 중심의 조선 사회에서 분명 명예로운 일이었다. 그러나 그 명예를 얻기 위해 노상추가 감내한 비용은 삶을 위협할 만큼 컸다. 시험 운영의 미숙함, 지방 유생의 불리함, 수차례의 취소와 연기 속에서 그는 오로지 ‘신분 상승’이라는 목표 하나만 의지해 버텼다. 그리고 그의 14년은 오늘날의 과열된 입시 구조를 자연스럽게 떠올리게 한다.\n경제가 성장하고 인구가 증가함에도 불구하고 그에 준하는 각종 사회 발전이 이루어지지 못한 것이 조선 후기였으니 오늘날에 비한다면 국민의 80%가 대학에 입학함에도 불구하고 여전히 대학 서열은 강고하고 하지만 대학을 졸업해도 딱히 성공을 보장받지 못하는 모습과 매우 유사하다.\n얼마 전 또 한 번의 수능이 끝났다. 결과가 어떻게 나오든, 그 사이에서 누군가는 자부심을, 또 누군가는 아쉬움을 느낄 것이다. 그러나 그 감정은 그 자체로 충분히 자연스럽고, 모두 각자의 자리에서 최선을 다했다는 증거다. 조선 시대 노상추의 일기장에 적힌 문구는 긴 세월이 흘렀음에도 우리가 같은 질문 앞에 서 있음을 보여주지만, 또다른 사실도 말해준다. 시험은 인생의 전부가 아니며, 공명은 시험이 아니라 살아가는 과정 속에서 만들어진다는 것이다. 힘을 내자. 그리고 아픔을 경험삼아 우리의 자녀들을 위하여 좀 더 나은 세상을 만들어 보자.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 이은호",
