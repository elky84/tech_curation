        "content:encodedSnippet": "AV1 — Now Powering 30% of Netflix Streaming\nLiwei Guo, Zhi Li, Sheldon Radford, Jeff Watts\nStreaming video has become an integral part of our daily lives. At Netflix, our top priority is delivering the best possible entertainment experience to our members, regardless of their devices or network conditions. One of the key technologies enabling this is AV1, a modern, open video codec that is rapidly transforming both how we stream content and how users experience it. Today, AV1 powers approximately 30% of all Netflix viewing, marking a major milestone in our efforts to bring more efficient and higher-quality streaming to our members.\nIn this post, we’ll revisit Netflix’s AV1 journey to date, highlight emerging use cases, and share adoption trends across the device ecosystem. Having witnessed AV1’s significant impact，and with AV2 on the horizon, we’re more excited than ever about how open codecs will continue to revolutionize streaming for everyone.\nAV1: A Modern, Open Codec\nSince entering the streaming business in 2007, Netflix has primarily relied on H.264/AVC as its streaming format. However, we quickly recognized that a modern, open codec would benefit not only Netflix, but the entire multimedia industry. In 2015, together with a group of like-minded industry leaders, Netflix co-founded the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia) to develop and promote next generation, open source media technologies. The AV1 codec became the first major project of this collaboration, with ambitious goals: to deliver significant improvements in compression efficiency over state-of-the-art codecs, and to introduce rich features that enable new use cases. After three years of collaborative development, AV1 was officially released in 2018.\nNetflix’s AV1 Journey: From Android to TVs and Beyond\nPiloting on Android Mobile\nWhen we first set out to bring AV1 streaming to Netflix members, Android was the ideal starting point. Android’s flexibility allowed us to quickly integrate a software AV1 decoder using the efficient dav1d library, which was already optimized for ARM chipsets in mobile devices.\nAV1’s superior compression efficiency was especially valuable for mobile users, many of whom are mindful of their data usage and network conditions. By adopting AV1, we were able to deliver noticeably better video quality at lower bitrates. For members relying on cellular data, this meant crisper images with fewer compression artifacts, even when bandwidth was limited. Launching AV1 support on Android in 2020 marked a significant step forward for Netflix on mobile, making high-quality streaming more accessible and enjoyable for members everywhere.\nFront-and-Center for Netflix VOD Streaming\nThe success of our AV1 launch on Android proved its value for Netflix streaming, motivating us to expand support to smart TVs and other large-screen devices, where most of our members watch their favorite shows.\nSmart TVs depend on hardware decoders for efficient high-quality playback. We worked closely with device manufacturers and SoC vendors to certify these devices, ensuring they are both conformant and performant. This collaborative effort enabled our AV1 streaming to TV devices in late 2021. Shortly thereafter, we expanded AV1 streaming to web browsers (in 2022) and continued to broaden device support. In 2023, this included Apple devices with the introduction of AV1 hardware support in the new M3 and A17 Pro chips.\nAs more devices began shipping with AV1 hardware support, a rapidly growing share of our members could enjoy the benefits of this advanced codec. Combined with our investment in adding AV1 streams across the entire catalog, AV1 viewing share has been consistently increasing in recent years. Today, AV1 accounts for approximately 30% of all Netflix streaming, making it our second most-used codec — and it’s on track to become number one very soon. The payoff has been substantial.\n\nElevating Streaming Experience Across the Board: Large-screen TVs and other devices demand higher bitrates to deliver stunning 4K, high frame rate (HFR) experiences. AV1’s superior compression efficiency has allowed us to provide these experiences using less data, making high-quality streaming more accessible and reliable. On average, AV1 streaming sessions achieve VMAF scores¹ that are 4.3 points higher than AVC and 0.9 points higher than HEVC sessions. At the same time, AV1 sessions use one-third less bandwidth than both AVC and HEVC, resulting in 45% fewer buffering interruptions. Moreover, Netflix’s diverse content catalog benefits universally from AV1, with improvements across all content types.\nDriving Network Efficiency Worldwide: Netflix streams are delivered through our own content delivery network (Open Connect), in partnership with local ISPs around the globe. With more than 300 million members, Netflix streaming constitutes a non-trivial portion of global internet traffic. Because AV1 is a more efficient codec, its streams are smaller in size (while providing even better visual quality). By shifting a substantial share of our streaming to AV1, we reduce overall internet bandwidth consumption, and lessen system and network load for both Netflix and our partners.\n\nUnlocking Advanced Experiences\nIn addition to its superior compression efficiency, AV1 was designed to support a rich set of features. Once we established a robust framework for the continuous expansion of AV1 streaming, we quickly shifted our focus towards exploring AV1’s unique features to unlock even more advanced and immersive experiences for our members.\nHigh-Dynamic-Range(HDR)\nHDR brings enhanced detail, vivid colors, and greater clarity to images. As a premium streaming service, Netflix has been a pioneer in adopting HDR, offering HDR streaming since 2016. In March 2025, we launched AV1 HDR streaming. We chose HDR10+ as the HDR format for its use of dynamic metadata, which enabled us to adapt the tone mapping per device in a scene-dependent manner.\nAs anticipated, the combination of AV1 and HDR10+ allows us to deliver images with greater detail, more vibrant colors, and an overall heightened sense of immersion for our members. At the moment, 85% of our HDR catalog (from the perspective of view-hours) has AV1-HDR10+ coverage, and this number is expected to reach 100% in the next couple of months.\nPhotographs of devices displaying the same (cropped) frame with HDR10 metadata (left) and HDR10+ metadata (right). Notice the preservation of the flashlight detail in the HDR10+ capture, and the over-exposure of the region under the flashlight in the HDR10 one.\nCinematic Film Grain\nFilm grain is a hallmark of the cinematic experience, widely used in the movie industry to enhance a film’s depth, texture, and realism. However, because film grain is inherently random, faithfully representing it in digital video requires a significant amount of data. This presents a unique challenge for streaming: restricting the bitrate can result in grain that appears unnatural or distorted, while increasing the bitrate to accurately preserve cinematic grain almost inevitably leads to elevated rebuffering. The AV1 specification incorporates a unique solution called Film Grain Synthesis (FGS). Instead of encoding grain as part of every frame, the grain is stripped out before encoding and then resynthesized at the decoder using parameters sent in the bitstream, delivering a realistic cinematic film grain experience without the usual data costs.\nThis approach represents a significant shift from traditional compression and streaming techniques. Our team invested substantial effort in fine-tuning the media processing pipeline, ensuring FGS delivers robust performance at scale. In July 2025, we successfully productized AV1 FGS, and the results were astonishing: AV1 with FGS could deliver videos with cinematic film grain at a bitrate well within the capabilities of typical household internet connections. For non-FGS AV1 encodings, even at much higher bitrate, they may not be able to achieve comparable quality.\nThe same (cropped) frame from source (left), regular AV1 stream encoded at 8274kbps (middle) and AV1 FGS stream encoded at 2804 kbps (right). The AV1 FGS stream reduces the bitrate by 66% while delivering clearly better quality.\nBeyond VOD Streaming\nSo far, our AV1 journey has been mainly on VOD, but we see significant opportunities for AV1 beyond traditional VOD streaming. On a mission to entertain the world, Netflix has constantly explored and established other ways to bring joy to our members, and we believe AV1 could contribute to the success of these new products.\nLive Streaming\nDebuting in 2023, live streaming has experienced rapid growth at Netflix, becoming a key part of our streaming offerings in just two short years. We are actively evaluating the use of AV1 in live streaming, as we believe it could help further scale Netflix’s live programming:\n\nHyper-scale concurrent viewership: Live streaming at Netflix means delivering content to tens of millions of viewers simultaneously. AV1’s superior compression efficiency could significantly reduce the required bandwidth, enabling us to deliver high-quality live experiences to large audiences without compromising video quality.\nCustomizable graphics overlay: for live sport events such as football, tennis and boxing, graphics overlays have become an integral part of the member experience — from embedding game statistics to delivering sponsorships. AV1 offers an opportunity to make the graphics highly customizable: layered coding is supported in AV1’s main profile, allowing encoding the main content in the base layer, and graphics in the enhancement layer, and easily swapping out one version of the enhancement layer with another. We envision that the use of AV1’s layered coding can greatly simplify the live streaming workflow and reduce delivery costs.\n\nCloud Gaming\nCloud gaming is a new Netflix offering that is currently in the beta phase and is available to members in select countries. The game engines run on cloud servers, while the rendered graphics are streamed directly to members’ devices. By removing barriers and transforming every Netflix-enabled device into a game console, Cloud gaming aims to deliver a seamless, “play anywhere” experience for our members. For a glimpse of this in action, watch as Co-CEO Greg Peters and CTO Elizabeth Stone play a round of Boggle Party — powered entirely by Netflix’s cloud gaming platform!\nUnlike traditional video streaming, cloud gaming requires that every player action is reflected instantly on the screen to ensure a responsive and immersive experience. This makes delivering high-quality video frames with extremely low latency, despite fluctuating network conditions, one of the biggest challenges in cloud gaming.\nOur team is actively working on productizing AV1 for cloud gaming. Given AV1’s high compression efficiency, we can reduce frame sizes, helping video frames get through even when network conditions become challenging. This positions AV1 as a promising technology for enabling a high-quality, low-latency gaming experience across a wide range of devices.\nA Device Ecosystem United for AV1\nNetflix is a streaming company, and we have worked diligently to create highly efficient and standards-conformant AV1 streams for our catalog. However, an equally, if not more, important factor in AV1’s success is the widespread support from device manufacturers. Throughout our AV1 journey, we have been impressed by the unprecedented pace at which the device ecosystem has embraced AV1.\nJust six months after the AV1 specification was finalized, the open-source AV1 decoder library sponsored by AOM, dav1d, was released. Small, performant, and highly resource-efficient, dav1d bridged the gap for early adopters like Netflix while hardware solutions were still in development. Continuous improvements to its performance and compatibility have made dav1d the preferred choice for a wide range of platforms and practical applications. Today, it serves as Android’s default software decoder. Additionally, it plays a key role in web browsers — for Netflix, it powers approximately 40% of our browser playback. This broad adoption has significantly expanded access to high-quality AV1 streaming, even in the absence of dedicated hardware decoders.\nNetflix maintains a close working relationship with device manufacturers and SoC vendors, and we have witnessed first-hand their enthusiasm for adopting AV1. To ensure optimal streaming performance, Netflix has a rigorous certification process to verify proper support for our streaming formats on devices. AV1 was added to this certification process in 2019, and since then, we have seen a steady increase in the number of devices with full AV1 decoding capabilities. Over the past five years (2021–2025), 88% of large-screen devices, including TVs, set-top boxes, and streaming sticks, submitted for Netflix certification have supported AV1, with the vast majority offering full 4K@60fps capability. Notably, since 2023, almost all devices we have received for certification are AV1-capable.\nWe have also been impressed by the robustness of AV1 implementations across these devices. As mentioned earlier, FGS is an innovative tool that departs from traditional codec architectures and was not included in our initial full-scale AV1 streaming rollout. When we launched FGS this July, we worked closely with our partners to ensure broad device compatibility. We are pleased with the successful progress made, and AV1 with FGS is now supported across a significant and growing number of in-field devices.\nLooking Ahead: AV1 Today, AV2 Tomorrow\nAs we reflect on our AV1 journey, it’s clear that the codec has already transformed the streaming experience for hundreds of millions of Netflix members worldwide. Thanks to industry-wide collaboration and rapid device adoption, AV1 is delivering higher quality, greater efficiency, and new cinematic features to more screens than ever before.\nLooking ahead, we are excited about the forthcoming release of AV2, announced by the Alliance for Open Media for the end of 2025. AV2 is poised to set a new benchmark for compression efficiency and streaming capabilities, building on the solid foundation laid by AV1. At Netflix, we remain committed to adopting the best open technologies to delight our members around the globe. While AV2 represents the future of streaming, AV1 is very much the present — serving as the backbone of our platform and powering exceptional entertainment experiences across a vast and ever-expanding ecosystem of devices.\nAcknowledgement\nThe success of AV1 at Netflix is the result of the dedication, expertise, and collaboration of many teams across the company — including Encoding, Clients, Device Certification, Partner Engineering, Data Science & Engineering, Infra, Platform, etc.\nWe would also like to thank Artem Danylenko, Aditya Mavlankar, Anne Aaron, Cyril Concolato, Allan Zhou and Anush Moorthy for their valuable comments and feedback on earlier drafts of this post.\nFootnotes\n\nThese numbers represent a snapshot of data from November 13, 2025. Actual values may vary slightly from day to day and across different regions, depending on the mix of content, devices, and internet connectivity.\n\nAV1 — Now Powering 30% of Netflix Streaming was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hey!\nHere at JetBrains, we’re always happy to bring our users the best and most popular tools available on the market. This has been true for decades with conventional dev tooling: compilers, debuggers, build tools, etc; in the past several years, we’ve shipped all the newest LLMs in the same manner, and we want the same to happen for AI agents. That’s why this fall we started working on the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Today, I’m excited to show a beta version of its support in the latest release-candidate versions of our IDEs.\nWhat is ACP?\nThe Agent Client Protocol standardizes communication between code IDEs and coding agents, much like LSP did for language servers. Users can choose any agent in the IDE they love, agent developers focus on core features instead of integrations, and IDE authors get new capabilities faster.\nWe believe that a common standard between coding agents and editors is actually a very natural point of separation. Humans and AI are working together in the same environment solving the same problems, so it makes sense for both parties to speak a shared language. Editor vendors and AI-agent developers have different strengths and areas of expertise, and a common standard helps them meet in the middle without getting in each other’s way. Such a protocol provides the core foundation, makes access predictable and streamlining the distribution, that lets everyone move faster.\nDemo\nThe latest 25.3 release candidate brings the betas ACP support to our unified AI chat. Feel free to use any ACP-compatible agent of your choice in our IDEs. While we’re in beta, we assume that you’ve already logged in to your CLI agent before adding it to the IDE. After that, you just need to adjust a configuration file and you’re good to go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the documentation to learn more about ACP in our IDEs.\nCurrent status\nWe’re shipping the beta version of ACP support in our IDEs and we’ll be happy to hear your feedback. If you’re an agent developer, feel free to join our community and share your ideas about the protocol. We hope to see more agents in our list.\nNote: AI Chat currently requires you to register and verify your account. We are working to simplify this flow. Within about a month, you should be able to access ACP agents with an option to skip JetBrains AI registration.\nWhat’s next?\nHere are the key directions we’re focusing on next. First, regarding the product’s UX: while applying standards, we are trading off some tailor-made features, and we want to bring some of them back into the protocol. Second, we are beginning work on agent distribution and aim to build a curated registry of ACP-capable agents. Third, we want to reuse the same standard for agents running on remote servers, not only on the local machine. And finally, we want to offer the MCP toolchain we have in IDEs, thereby improving the agents themselves.\nBehind the closed doors\nBefore we wrap up, I want to share a bit of behind-the-scenes context on how JetBrains came to ACP. Real life is a bit different, and I think it’s always nice to pull back the curtain and show you how it works from the inside. So, here we go.\nThis summer we started working on bringing Junie (it’s a coding agent developed by JetBrains) into the same UI that we had for the AI chat. After some debates, we built a protocol that allowed us to communicate between IDE and local and remote versions of Junie. We were about to publish that work to the internet, but almost at the same time, Zed announced its own protocol. We chatted with lovely Zed people and agreed that instead of bringing two competitive standards to the market, we’d join our efforts on building a single one.\nAnd so far we are really happy with our choice. From the user perspective, we see plenty of ACP-capable agents now and more to come. Technically, the protocol is easy to implement while providing powerful and flexible UX in the product. From a business standpoint, we now have good relationships with multiple partners. And not the least, personally, I’m really happy to work together with passionate people, it’s always encouraging.\nWhat our partners are saying\n“Developers should be able to use the best AI agent in the workflow that suits them, and ACP makes that possible. Setup was easy and Auggie just works, exactly what every developer wants. ACP is a win for developer choice and a big step toward a more open, agent-driven ecosystem.”\n– Chris Kelly, Product, Augment Code\n“In AI coding agents, openness will win when developers can choose the tools that work best for them instead of being locked into a single vendor’s ecosystem. That’s why open protocols like ACP matter. Personally, I have been using PyCharm for over a decade, and at Block we have long been part of the JetBrains community through our Kotlin adoption and ecosystem contributions. ACP lets goose integrate into IntelliJ seamlessly. Developers can bring their own LLM and log in directly without extra authorization overhead. When open source tools like goose and ACP work together, developers get the freedom to choose, and we get to focus on making our agent smarter instead of maintaining IDE-specific code.”\n– Douwe Osinga, goose Open Source Lead, Block\n“At Zed, we believe the best things are built together. Collaborating with JetBrains on ACP has felt like we were one team from day one. Driven by a shared commitment to deliver the best experience for our users, we’ve made it possible for developers to use the agents they know and love in their favorite editor. This release brings ACP to an entirely new audience, and I’m excited to see the response as we shape the roadmap together.”\n– Ben Brandt, Rust Engineer, Zed Industries\n“At Moonshot AI, we’ve always believed that the future of coding agents belongs to developers, not vendors. By integrating with JetBrains via the open ACP protocol, Kimi CLI can now run natively in the IDEs that hundreds of millions of developers already love and trust. No lock-in, no extra authentication dance, no compromise on model choice. This is exactly the kind of open, composable agent ecosystem we want to see win.”\n— Richard Chien, Kimi CLI Maintainer, Moonshot AI\nThanks\nNone of this would have been possible without lots of people. Special thanks to Alexey Stukalov, Anna Zhdan, Artem Bukhonov, Ben Brandt, Denis Shiryaev, Franciska Dethlefsen, Stas Erokhin, and all others for their contributions. It’s been a nice journey, and I hope it’s only the beginning.",

        "pubDate": "Fri, 05 Dec 2025 12:31:31 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article was brought to you by Rajkumar Venkatasamy, draft.dev.\nJenkins is still one of the most popular tools for continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). People love it for its flexibility, vast plugin ecosystem, and the fact that it’s open source. It can automate just about any build, test, or deployment you throw at it, but that flexibility comes with a catch: configuration drift.\nConfiguration drift happens when someone makes changes through the Jenkins user interface (UI) (often referred to as “click-ops”) that don’t get reflected in the code, such as Jenkinsfiles for pipelines, Job DSL scripts for job definitions, or YAML files in Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC). Over time, these discrepancies create inconsistencies across environments, making it hard to reproduce builds, ensure compliance, or recover from disasters.\n\nConfiguration drift happens when someone makes changes through the Jenkins user interface (UI) (often referred to as “click-ops”) that don’t get reflected in the code.\nImagine this scenario: A developer tweaks a job’s build retention policy in the UI to debug an issue, but forgets to update the corresponding Job DSL script. In production, this leads to unexpected disk usage spikes, while dev and test environments behave differently because they’re still using the original retention settings (e.g. ten builds). \nThis kind of drift undermines the whole point of DevOps. It erodes trust; what’s in version control no longer matches reality. If you’re dealing with compliance requirements (like SOC 2 or GDPR), you’ve got audit problems because there’s no trail for these changes. And when disaster strikes and you need to rebuild your Jenkins controller, you might get your data back, but not the drifted configs. Cue the downtime.\nIn this guide, you’ll learn how to manage and eliminate configuration drift in your Jenkins setup. We’ll cover how to baseline what you’ve currently got, codify configurations, enforce access controls, and implement continuous detection and remediation. \nBy the end, you’ll have tools and strategies to maintain a single source of truth and a Jenkins setup that’s actually reproducible and auditable. This guide assumes that you have prior DevOps experience, particularly in installing and managing Jenkins.\nManage configuration drift in Jenkins \nManaging configuration drift requires a systematic approach: Observe what’s required as part of the CI/CD pipeline, codify everything possible, prevent unauthorized changes, and monitor for deviations. Each step builds on the last, emphasizing why it matters for auditability (tracking who did what) and reproducibility (ensuring configs can be recreated reliably from code).\nDetermine a baseline and observe drift\nTo tackle configuration drift, you need a clear picture of your Jenkins environment’s current state. A baseline establishes a single source of truth for reproducibility, while ongoing monitoring provides auditability, revealing who changed what and when. After baselining, you can use tools to monitor changes and detect drift.\nExport current controller configuration with JCasC\nStart by exporting your Jenkins controller’s configuration using the JCasC plugin. If the plugin isn’t installed, add it via Manage Jenkins | Manage Plugins, search for “Configuration as Code”, and install it (no restart required). \nThen, use the Jenkins CLI to export the current configuration to a YAML file, which captures core settings, plugins, security, and more. Run this command from a terminal with the Jenkins CLI JAR:\njava -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ -auth:your_admin_user:your_admin_password export-configuration > jenkins.yaml\n\n\n\n\nThis jenkins.yaml file is your baseline. It reflects the exact state of your Jenkins instance at this moment. This snapshot lets you compare against future configurations to quantify drift, ensuring you can revert to or rebuild this state for disaster recovery or reproducibility across environments.\n\n\n\n\nEnable Job Configuration History to monitor drift\nWith the baseline captured, you’ll need to install the Job Configuration History plugin to act as your “drift radar”. This plugin tracks changes to jobs, views, and system configurations, logging diffs that show who modified what and when.\nNavigate to Manage Jenkins | Manage Plugins, look up Job Configuration History, and install it. Once that’s installed, you can access it via Manage Jenkins > Job Config History to view a history of changes, including diffs in XML format.\nFor example, if someone later changes a job’s executor label or build retention policy via the UI, the plugin shows the before-and-after XML, highlighting the drift from your coded configurations (e.g. Job DSL or Jenkinsfiles). \nReview these diffs weekly to spot unauthorized or undocumented changes. This provides an audit trail for compliance (e.g. who made a change for SOC 2 audits) and helps identify patterns, like frequent UI edits, that indicate where drift originates.\n\n\n\n\nMove controller configurations to code\nYou can use the exported Jenkins YAML file to transition your Jenkins controller configuration to a code-based approach using the JCasC plugin. This plugin lets you define Jenkins’s global settings, security, agents, and plugins in YAML, which can be stored in Git for version control and auditability. \nOn startup, Jenkins loads this YAML, overwriting any UI changes. It enforces a single source of truth in version control, where changes go through pull requests (PRs) for review. This makes configs auditable and reproducible across environments.\nStore the YAML in a Git repo, and set the environment variable CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG to point to it (e.g. a file path or Git repo URL of the YAML file). A snippet from this YAML might look like this:\nconfiguration-as-code: {\n  }\ncredentials:\n  folder: {\n    }\n  providerImpl: {\n    }\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n    - domain: {\n        }\n  user: {\n    }\njenkins:\n  authorizationStrategy:\n    loggedInUsersCanDoAnything:\n      allowAnonymousRead: false\n..\n..\n..\n  securityRealm:\n    local:\n      allowsSignup: false\n      enableCaptcha: false\n      users:\n      - id: \"admin\"\n        name: \"admin\"\n…\n…\n…\n\ntool:\n  git:\n    installations:\n    - home: \"git\"\n      name: \"Default\"\n  mavenGlobalConfig:\n    globalSettingsProvider: \"standard\"\n    settingsProvider: \"standard\"\nNotice that the exported configuration includes a credentials section for defining secrets. Make sure you keep secret values out of source control by referencing environment variables or using JCasC’s credentials section with external providers like HashiCorp Vault.\nNote: You need to have the HashiCorp Vault plugin installed and configured in your Jenkins for this to work.\n\n\n\n\nFor instance, the credentials section needs to be configured similarly to the one below to map the secret from HashiCorp Vault:\ncredentials:\n  system:\n    domainCredentials:\n      - credentials:\n          - vaultTokenCredential:\n              description: \"My Secret\"\n              id: \"MY_SECRET\"\n              scope: GLOBAL\n              token: \"${MY_SECRET_TOKEN}\"\nThis separation ensures sensitive data isn’t committed, maintaining security while keeping configs versioned. If you want to learn more about how to handle secrets, check out this JCasC plugin.\nMove jobs and pipelines to code\nJobs and pipelines are prime drift culprits; UI-based tweaks can easily diverge from versioned code. You can use the Job DSL plugin to define and generate Jenkins jobs programmatically using Groovy scripts. This plugin treats job configurations as code, so you can automate them, version them, and manage hundreds of jobs without clicking through the UI. \nWhen you regenerate jobs from the DSL, it overwrites any manual changes, keeping everything consistent.To get started with Job DSL, install the plugin via Manage Jenkins | Manage Plugins, search for “Job DSL”, and install it:\n\n\n\n\nThe seed job is central to the Job DSL plugin’s workflow. It serves as a special freestyle or pipeline job that executes your Groovy DSL scripts to dynamically create or update other jobs. \nThe seed job acts as an entry point: It pulls the DSL scripts from version control (e.g. Git) and processes them to generate the target jobs. A seed job lets you automate job creation at scale, making it ideal for managing dozens or hundreds of jobs consistently.\nIf you want to learn more about how to define and make use of seed jobs, check out this official documentation. For pipelines, use Jenkinsfiles in your application repositories to define declarative or scripted pipelines. These are loaded directly from SCM during job execution, further reducing UI reliance:\n// Jenkinsfile\npipeline {\n    agent any\n    stages {\n        stage('Build') {\n            steps {\n                echo 'Building...'\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nAs your CI/CD setup grows, shared libraries help handle the complexity. They’re best when multiple pipelines need to reuse common logic like authentication steps, deployment workflows, or utility functions. These help you avoid code duplication across Jenkinsfiles.\nWithout shared libraries, duplication increases maintenance overhead, risks inconsistencies, and encourages UI overrides for quick-fixes. Shared libraries centralize reusable Groovy code in a separate Git repository, promoting the principles of DRY (don’t repeat yourself) and discouraging ad hoc UI changes.\nEnforce guardrails that prevent “click-ops” drift\nPreventing configuration drift is critical to maintaining reproducible, auditable, and compliant Jenkins environments. You can use the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin to control who can perform UI edits. \nMake sure you only grant “Configure” permissions to a small admin group. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized click-ops and forces changes to be made through code paths that are reviewable and auditable. For read-only access, use the Extended Read plugin.\nDefine the authorization configuration using these Matrix Authorization Strategy and Extended Read plugins in jenkins.yaml, like this:\njenkins:\n  authorizationStrategy:\n    globalMatrix:\n      permissions:\n        - \"Overall/Administer:admin-group\"\n        - \"Job/Configure:admin-group\"\n        - \"Overall/Read:everyone\"\n        - \"Job/Read:everyone\"\nThis jenkins.yaml configuration defines the authorization strategy for the Jenkins instance, specifically implementing a global matrix security model for access control. It establishes a set of permissions for different users or groups. The configuration grants the admin-group both the highest level of administrative access, indicated by \"Overall/Administer\", and the ability to configure jobs, shown by \"Job/Configure\". \nSimultaneously, it ensures that everyone (meaning any user) has basic read access to the Jenkins overall status and to individual jobs, represented by \"Overall/Read\" and \"Job/Read\", respectively. Essentially, it creates a system where only the designated administrator group can manage and configure Jenkins, while all other users can view the system and its jobs.\nDetect and remediate drift continuously\nEven with specific guardrails like matrix authorization restricting UI edits to admins, configuration drift can still occur in subtle ways. For instance, admins might make legitimate but undocumented UI changes during urgent debugging (e.g. temporarily increasing build retention for troubleshooting); to prevent drift, codify these changes in Job DSL or JCasC or revert them after resolving the issue.\nPlugin updates can introduce default settings that override existing configurations if not pinned in code. External factors, like agent failures prompting ad hoc label changes or third-party integrations (e.g. a GitHub webhook tweak), can also introduce discrepancies. In multi-user environments, even with read-only access enforced, shared credentials or misconfigured roles might allow indirect changes via scripts or APIs. \nThese scenarios highlight why proactive monitoring is necessary. Drift often stems from human oversight or system events, not malice, but they erode reproducibility and auditability if unchecked.\nMonitor Job Configuration History diffs and script comparisons (e.g. check export job XML and diff against the job’s DSL). If drift is detected, revert via JCasC reload or codify the change in Git. For mass remediation, use the Configuration Slicing plugin to align settings across multiple jobs (i.e. build discarders, labels, or email notifications).\n\n\n\n\nThis plugin enables “slicing” by category (e.g. all discard-old-builds settings), selecting jobs, and applying uniform values, then capturing the result in DSL/JCasC to prevent recurrence. It restores consistency quickly for large-scale drift (e.g. after a plugin update affects over fifty jobs) while promoting code-based baselines for long-term prevention.\nOperational tips\nWhen it comes to managing configuration drift in Jenkins, treat Jenkins like your apps. Lint JCasC YAML with tools like yamllint in PR pipelines, and validate Job DSL with a Groovy linter. Synchronize plugin updates with config as code. Use the Plugin Installation Manager Tool to define plugins in JCasC:\nplugins:\n- artifactId: git\n  source:\n    version: latest\n- artifactId: \"mailer\"\n  source:\n    version: \"1.32\"\nPlugins affect configs; make sure you version them for rollbacks to ensure auditability.\nMonitoring Jenkins with Prometheus and Grafana helps you track config-related metrics, like job change frequency, so you can spot configuration drift early and keep your CI/CD environment reproducible. After installing the Prometheus Metrics Plugin in Jenkins, metrics like job configuration changes (tracked via the Job Configuration History plugin) or build-related data become available at an endpoint like http://localhost:8080/prometheus.\nGrafana integrates with Prometheus to visualize these metrics in dashboards, letting you graph job change frequency over time or filter by job or user. For example, a query like jenkins_job_config_changes_total{job=\"DemoJob\"} tracks how often DemoJob is modified. T\nhis setup requires configuring Prometheus to scrape Jenkins (via prometheus.yml), setting up Grafana with Prometheus as a data source, and creating dashboards with queries tailored to configuration events, ensuring continuous monitoring and rapid remediation of drift in your Jenkins.\nConclusion\nBy baselining with Job Configuration History and JCasC exports, codifying configurations via YAML and DSL, enforcing access controls with the Matrix Authorization Strategy plugin, and detecting/remediating issues with slicing and monitoring, you can build a split strategy for managing configuration drift in Jenkins. This approach helps establish a workflow where changes are versioned, reviewed, and reproducible.\nThat said, the plugins covered here require ongoing setup and maintenance. If you’re looking to remove this class of problems entirely, JetBrains TeamCity can help handle configuration versioning natively. TeamCity bakes “config in VCS” into the product with versioned settings and Kotlin DSL, including two-way sync that commits UI changes to Git (or one-way, read-only mode that disallows UI edits), validation before application, audit/history views, and tokenized handling of secure values.\nBeyond configuration management, TeamCity also offers a more polished developer experience. If you’re curious about the day-to-day differences between Jenkins and TeamCity, check out our article “From Clunky to Clean: A UI/UX Comparison of Jenkins and TeamCity.” It walks through the practical UI/UX differences that impact productivity the most.\nWhether you refine your Jenkins setup or migrate to a tool like TeamCity, you’ll achieve drift-free CI/CD, boosting team productivity and system reliability.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This month brings significant developments throughout the Java ecosystem. Java has begun announcing JEPs targeted for the upcoming release, while Spring has unveiled major updates with Spring Framework 7 and Spring Boot 4.\nAs always, we’ve curated the most interesting articles, videos, and podcasts covering Java, Kotlin, Spring, AI, and other relevant topics in technology and software development. \nWe’re also pleased to feature Siva Katamreddy as our guest author, who has selected valuable content and resources from across the developer community.\nThere’s plenty to explore, so let’s dive in.\nFeatured Content\nSiva Katamreddy\nSiva is a Developer Advocate at JetBrains with more than 19 years of experience in building scalable, distributed enterprise applications. He has strong hands-on experience in building cloud-native applications using the Java platform. A published author, Siva loves to share his knowledge on his blog and YouTube channel.\nSpring Framework 7 and Spring Boot 4 went GA in November 2025, delivering features such as API versioning, enhancements to the HTTP service client, resilience features in Core Spring, Jackson 3 support, and more. You can explore these new features in the Road to GA article series.\nOne of the major changes in Spring Boot 4 is the modularization of the previously single spring-boot-autoconfigure JAR into separate modules, each focused on specific functionality. This ensures that your application includes only the autoconfiguration relevant to the modules you import, reducing the runtime footprint. Similarly, the spring-boot-test-autoconfigure JAR has also been split, allowing you to include only the test starters you actually need.\n//Spring Boot 3.x\n\nimplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'\n\nimplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'\n\nimplementation 'org.flywaydb:flyway-core'\n\ntestImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'\n\n//Spring Boot 4.x\n\nimplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc'\n\nimplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa'\n\nimplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-flyway'\n\ntestImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-webmvc-test'\n\ntestImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-jpa-test'\n\ntestImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-flyway-test'\nDan Vega, Developer Advocate at Broadcom, has published an excellent video series covering the new features in Spring Framework 7 and Spring Boot 4. I highly recommend watching the following:\nAPI Versioning Made Simple with Spring Boot 4.0\nSpring Framework 7: Dynamic Bean Registration Made Easy\nJackson 3 Support is HERE: What’s New in Spring Framework 7 & Spring Boot 4\nSpring Boot 4’s Built-in Resilience Features: Say Goodbye to External Dependencies!\nIntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 provides support for these new features, enabling developers to use them seamlessly. For more details, refer to the article: IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 💚 Spring 7. IntelliJ IDEA now also offers improved Spring Data JDBC support, including the ability to generate entities from an existing database, generating Flyway or Liquibase migrations from Spring Data JDBC entities, synchronize models with database schema, and more.\nHave you ever wanted to debug a Spring Boot application running remotely? In my latest video, I demonstrate how to use IntelliJ IDEA’s remote JVM debugging capability to connect to a Spring Boot application running remotely (in a Docker container) and step through the code.\nSpring AI is an excellent choice for building GenAI-powered applications on the JVM, and Spring AI 1.1 GA has been released with many new features and enhancements. The new annotation-based programming model significantly simplifies the building of MCP servers and clients, with support for multiple transport options including STDIO, HTTP SSE, and Streamable HTTP. You can upgrade to Spring AI 1.1 using the Arconia CLI.\nIf you want to master Spring AI, be sure to read Spring AI in Action by Craig Walls.\nIf, like me, you are interested in understanding how GenAI is transforming software development, you may also enjoy the following articles:\nSoftware Development in the Time of Strange New Angels\nAI’s 70% Problem\nInterestingly, many developers who use AI agents for software development are now recommending spec-driven development.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As the next step in the evolution of K2 mode, with the IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 release we are officially deprecating its predecessor, K1 mode. In this post, we’ll give some background about K2 mode and discuss its current state, including adoption numbers, performance test results, and feature parity and stability.\nAs always, we recommend updating to the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA for the best possible experience.\nWhat is K2 mode, and why was it necessary?\nFor years, IntelliJ IDEA relied on the internals of the old Kotlin compiler, which made it harder to improve performance and maintain stability as the language evolved. For us, it was a structural bottleneck that limited our ability to make advancements with Kotlin, both from a language perspective and in terms of tooling.\nWith K2 mode, we rebuilt the analysis engine to make it faster and more scalable. It also includes the Kotlin Analysis API, which provides a clear and stable way to access code information without depending on compiler internals. K2 mode serves as a new foundation for Kotlin support in IntelliJ IDEA, making it possible to support future Kotlin language features, evolve faster, and improve the reliability of code analysis. \nThis took a ton of architectural rework. A lot of functionalities were rewritten and redesigned. Almost every migrated feature or inspection required some level of updates and optimization.\nCheck out this blog post for an in-depth look at K2 mode’s development.\n\n\n\n\nAdoption\nAlmost everyone working with IntelliJ IDEA today is already on K2 mode. Among those using version 2025.2, K2 mode has been adopted by:\n98.6% of Ultimate users.\n\n\n\n\n99.5% of Community Edition users.\n\n\n\n\nThat leaves only 1.4% (Ultimate) and 0.5% (Community) still on K1 mode. These remaining cases typically fall into niche categories, for example those who:\nWork with internal plugins that still depend on K1 mode.\n\n\n\n\nAre missing functionality in rare workflows.\n\n\n\n\nDisabled K2 mode earlier and haven’t switched back.\n\n\n\n\nFor these users, we’ve kept a VM option to re-enable K1 mode: \n-Didea.kotlin.plugin.use.k1 = true.\nYou can find instructions for configuring VM options in the IntelliJ IDEA documentation.\nIf you rely on K1 mode because K2 mode isn’t suitable for your current setup or workflow, please get in touch with us. \nPerformance\nThe following performance measurements are based on a mix of internal and open-source projects, including IntelliJ-based IDEs, the Kotlin language repo, the Ktor framework, JetBrains Toolbox, kotlinx.coroutines, the Anki Android app, LeakCanary library, SQLiter, Arrow, jOOQ, and others. \nThe numbers are not precise, as many factors within the release could influence performance, so we are taking the average measurements to compare K2 mode vs K1 mode over time. But these results help paint the general picture.\nCode analysis\nFor code analysis, our K2 mode performance tests show an improvement of approximately 39% (with an average range of 27-51%).\nK2 mode is sometimes slower for very small/empty files (90ms vs 200ms in some cases), but for big files it’s much faster (50s+ vs 10s).\n\n\n\n\nFind Usages\nFor Find Usages, our tests show an improvement of approximately 34% compared to K1 mode (47-57% on average).\n\n\n\n\nCode completion\nIn the previous release, some users reported issues with the performance and quality of code completion, so we made this a priority for 2025.3.\nFor this release, we delivered an updated completion implementation that now runs in parallel, leveraging the multi-threaded nature of the Analysis API.\nBased on our performance test data and EAP feedback, we achieved a speed improvement of approximately 26% compared to the previous release. Completion is now more responsive and the first results show up faster than before.\nThe completion performance gains vary depending on the scenario. Some show significant improvement, while others – such as projects using jOOQ – do not yet benefit from the K2 mode completion updates and for now may even be slower than before. We are aiming to address this in future releases.\nParallel completion remains an ongoing effort, and additional optimizations are planned for future releases.\nIntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 also includes several completion quality improvements, for example:\nArgument completion now respects parameter names more accurately.\nExpected types are taken into account in a broader range of contexts.\n\n\n\n\nThese changes improve the overall relevance and reliability of completion suggestions.\nWe do not consider this the final step of our performance improvement journey. The K2 architecture continues to unlock further optimization opportunities, and we’re actively pursuing them.\nStability\nMeasuring stability is always challenging, as many factors influence the overall experience. However, we’ve clearly observed several positive trends.\nFrom the telemetry side, we are receiving fewer support requests related to Kotlin overall, and our EAP builds show a noticeable decrease in exception reports. While we can’t attribute all of these improvements solely to K2 mode, the new architecture has undeniably helped us address entire categories of long-standing issues.\nStability is also reflected in user feedback. Over the past months, we’ve spoken with numerous teams and company leaders to understand how K2 mode behaves in real production environments. The responses have been positive:\n“IDE is much more stable now, which is really nice. I’m on the latest version, and it’s indeed noticeable!”\n“I have the feeling that the indexing of the project is way faster. And there is no longer the reindexing that used to take 30 minutes each time.”\n“I can’t pinpoint when it happened, but after the release that enabled K2 by default, all my problems disappeared! No more IDE errors.”\n“K2 mode has been working great for everyone inside our company.”\n\n\n\n\nWhile those are good indicators, stability work is never finished. We will continue improving reliability, addressing edge cases, and tightening the feedback loop with teams that work with large or complex Kotlin projects.\nFeature parity\nK2 mode has reached near-complete feature parity with K1 mode, with only a few remaining exceptions.\nInspections, intention actions, quick-fixes, and refactorings\nNot all inspections and refactorings made it into K2 mode, as we have a list of items that are triggered by less than 0.5% of users.\nFor certain rarely-used features, the low usage rate is by design, as they are intended to be used only in rare cases. These features were migrated to K2 mode.\nBut for other features, rare usage indicates a need to redesign or even retire them, as they are not delivering the value they were originally supposed to provide.\nIn upcoming release cycles, as part of our regular development process, we will revisit these features and re-work them or migrate them as appropriate.\nAnd we’re not stopping there – we’ll continue to add new features, inspections, and quick-fixes in future releases.\nType matching completion\nWe’ve also received requests to improve type matching completion, a feature currently used by less than 2% of developers. In this release cycle, smart type completion has not been our primary focus, as we’ve been dedicating our efforts to improving overall completion performance and quality.\nSmart type completion remains on our roadmap, and we will continue enhancing its quality and reliability in upcoming releases, but overall completion performance is more important.\nThank you for your feedback\nYour feedback is the driving force behind all the improvements we make!\nWe began developing K2 mode as a bold, long-term solution to problems that could not be solved through incremental fixes. Throughout this journey, we’ve received invaluable input through YouTrack issues, Slack discussions, threads, conference conversations, and in-person meetings. All of this has shaped K2 mode into what it is today.\nYour feedback doesn’t just help us fix issues – it helps us define the future of Kotlin tooling. Thank you for continuing to share your thoughts.\nAs of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, Kotlin support in the IDE is now fully powered by K2 mode, and this officially concludes the project of implementing K2 mode. The architectural foundations we built will continue driving improvements across performance, stability, and ecosystem support, as well as new features.\nStay tuned – there’s much more to come.",

        "pubDate": "Wed, 03 Dec 2025 09:33:13 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "A year ago, we introduced a free non-commercial use license option for JetBrains Rider, hoping to remove barriers for developers who code with no financial objective in mind for their projects. Recently, we put out a call for your stories – curious to learn how you’ve been using Rider throughout this year. \nWhat came back moved us. From kitchen table coders teaching themselves cross-platform development to seasoned architects reconnecting with why they fell in love with programming in the first place, your stories reminded us that the best code often comes from curiosity, not commerce. Here are five of those stories.\n\nAnton’s story: A cloud architect who turned a childhood board game into an experiment in coding and AI.\nFabio’s story: A novelist, musician, and software architect building a private space for writers to share their work.\nDarren’s story: A self-taught hobby programmer who turned a lockdown coding experiment into a cross-platform productivity app.\nGregori’s story: A developer exploring how programming languages are made – by building one of his own.\n Chris’s story: A university developer helping professors and students learn through dialogue with AI.\n\nBuilding a digital board game with AI and Rider\nCuriosity has always driven Anton Makarevich’s relationship with technology. Trained as a civil engineer, he taught himself to code out of pure fascination. “I never studied computer science,” he says. “Programming was always a hobby. I started in school, making small games and automation tools just for fun.”\nThat sense of experimentation never left him. Today, Anton works as a cloud architect, designing large-scale solutions in AWS and Azure. But in his spare time, he still returns to his roots by writing code for the sheer joy of it. His latest project, MakaMek, is a digital adaptation of the classic BattleTech board game, which he’s loved since childhood. Rather than using a traditional game engine, Anton decided to build it entirely with .NET libraries and Avalonia UI – a decision driven by curiosity as much as by his desire for a challenge.\n“I really enjoy the process of coding itself. In game engines like Unity or Unreal, you’re mostly connecting assets. I wanted to see how far I could go writing everything myself.”\n\n            \nAnton Makarevich\n                                                                MakaMek creator, Cloud Architect\n                                    \nBut MakaMek wasn’t just about revisiting a childhood passion. It became a playground for exploring the role of AI in software development. Anton wanted to see if an AI coding assistant could meaningfully contribute to a long-term project without creating chaos in the codebase. “The idea was to see if AI could effectively execute specific coding tasks I gave it,” he explains. “A year later, the code still makes sense, and I can add features easily without breaking things – so I’d say it was a success.”\nHis workflow became an intricate collaboration between multiple AI agents and JetBrains Rider. He often uses AI to generate specifications or boilerplate code, but then relies on Rider’s refactoring tools to make everything clean, consistent, and reliable. \n“AI agents are perfectly capable of refactoring and ensuring the code compiles,” Anton says. “However, very often it takes them much more time and costs a ton of tokens in the process. Rider’s refactoring tools are simply faster at delivering reliable results, and they are predictable.”\nFor Anton, Rider is more than an IDE. It’s the environment that keeps him connected to his love of programming. With the free non-commercial use license, he can keep exploring that passion on his own terms: “It’s an amazing opportunity to use professional tools even when you’re just experimenting.”\nFor now, MakaMek remains a personal sandbox project, something Anton occasionally playtests with his son. “It’s not meant for commercial release. Similar open-source versions already exist,” he says. “For me, it’s about keeping my skills sharp, having fun, and remembering why I started coding in the first place.”\nWriting novellas – and code! – for connection\nFor Fabio Scagliola, creativity takes many forms. He’s a software architect by profession, a published novelist, and a musician with four albums to his name. But his latest personal project, Nerdy Weird Words, bridges all those worlds – a digital platform designed to help writers share their drafts privately with a trusted circle of readers.\nThe idea came from a simple frustration. After finishing his first novel, Fabio wanted feedback from friends and fellow writers without sending files back and forth or resorting to public platforms. \n“I couldn’t find anything that struck the right balance between privacy and collaboration. You can use Google Docs, Reddit, or Reedsy, but either it’s too public or too tied to corporate ecosystems. I wanted something intimate, where you invite readers, exchange comments, but stay in control.”\n\n            \nFabio Scagliola\n                                                                Creator of Nerdy Weird Words, Software Architect, Writer, Musician\n                                    \nSo, he decided to build it himself.\nHe chose .NET for the backend and React for the frontend – and naturally, JetBrains Rider as his IDE. Fabio had discovered JetBrains products years earlier while working on Java and PHP projects, falling in love with IntelliJ IDEA and PhpStorm before eventually returning to .NET. “After using IntelliJ IDEA, I just couldn’t go back to other IDEs,” he admits. “So when I returned to Microsoft technologies, I chose to go with Rider.” \nFabio finds Rider’s philosophy resonates with him: it’s feature-rich yet flexible, sophisticated yet intuitive. “The keyboard shortcuts just make sense, the workflow feels natural, and it’s not a ‘prison IDE’ the way some others are. You can adapt it to yourself without losing structure,” he says. \nWhen JetBrains announced the free for non-commercial use license, it was the missing piece for his new project. “At work, I use the commercial version through my company,” he explains. “But for my personal projects, I wanted something legal and professional on my own laptop. I was ready to pay if needed, but discovering the non-commercial license was a wonderful surprise.”\nRider has even helped Fabio rediscover his technical fluency. After spending several years focused on architecture, Fabio admits he felt “a bit rusty with .NET and C#.” Rider’s suggestions and warnings, he says, “definitely helped me improve some parts of my code.”\nAs for Nerdy Weird Words, the project is open-source, a choice rooted in Fabio’s belief in what he calls “inner source” – bringing one’s full skillset and the spirit of open collaboration to any project you work on. “I believe in sharing knowledge,” he says. “That’s how we grow – as teams, as a community, as a society.”\nHis hopes for the platform are humble but heartfelt. “When someone tells me a song I wrote moved them, or they got lost in my book – that’s the feeling I’m after. This project is an extension of that. So, if even two writers use it to share their work and tell me it helped them, that’s a success to me,” he smiles. \n“It’s become an addictive and creative part of my routine”\n“I’m a 59-year-old kitchen fitter and self-taught hobby programmer,” Darren Hind begins. “I started learning C# during the COVID lockdown.”\nHis first project was a practical one – an app to make his work life easier. “It helped me with day-to-day tasks, things like a diary, expenses tracking, scheduling, and invoicing using basic CRUD operations. I first built it with Entity Framework, then recreated it in WinForms, and later moved it to WPF as I learned more.”\nWhen he later bought an iMac, cross-platform limitations pushed him to explore new options. “That’s when I discovered Rider and Avalonia,” he says. “It’s really great that I could get a free non-commercial licence to help me along. I decided to port my app over, which took about a month, and it worked brilliantly across platforms.”\nSince then, Darren has continued to experiment. “I’ve started building a Blazor web app in Rider, reusing the same class library from my desktop project. I’m still very much an amateur,” he says, “but the process has been incredibly rewarding.”\n“Rider has made it much easier to explore C#, XAML, MVVM, and MySQL at my own pace. What began as a lockdown hobby has become an addictive and creative part of my routine.”\n\n            \nDarren Hind\n                                                                Hobby Developer\n                                    \nDarren credits Rider’s structure with helping him learn. “Rider keeps everything tidy and consistent, which helps a lot when you’re learning. The way it organizes projects, highlights mistakes, and offers quick-fixes or hints has been a big help in understanding how things fit together,” he explains. “I also like that Rider feels fast and responsive, so I can focus on experimenting instead of fighting with the setup. Little things like instant navigation between files and integrated database tools really help keep the motivation going, because I’m not getting stuck on the technical side. I can just get on with learning.”\nAsked what he’s most proud of, Darren points to the architecture of his project. “Writing bits of code is one thing, but understanding how everything bolts together is something else entirely,” he says. “Getting my head around MVVM was a steep learning curve, but when I look at my folder layout now – with shared class libraries for models and data layers – I’m proud that I took the long route. It’s much more maintainable and feels like a proper application.”\n\n\n\n\nAnd on the free for non-commercial use license, Darren’s gratitude is plain. “Oh, for sure, I couldn’t be without it now, even if I had to pay for it! It really does remove the barriers for hobby programmers to learn properly.”\nA new programming language created with Rider\n“I’ve always been curious about how programming languages work, especially C#, which is the one I use and really enjoy,” says Gregori Bruno Felicio, a developer from Brazil, “That’s why I started this project.” \nThe project is G#, his own programming language built on .NET. Gregori explains. “G# started as a personal study – something small just to learn – but it slowly grew into a serious challenge. It’s still in a very early stage, but my goal is to make it something truly real and usable.”\nAt first, G# was an experiment. The original goal was to build “a Python-like syntax with .NET power,” but that ambition evolved, and began to take shape as something larger and more structured. Gregori switched to a strongly typed design to keep things consistent and maintainable.\n“G# pushed me to learn deep .NET topics like IL generation, reflection, Roslyn internals, and runtime type systems – things we don’t usually touch in everyday work,” he says. “Along the way, I started to really understand why some programming languages make certain design choices, like using {} or ;, or deciding not to. Every small syntax choice adds or removes complexity, and now I see the trade-offs and intentions behind languages that I used to judge just by their syntax.”\nRider has been his constant companion throughout the process. “Honestly, I’ve always been a Rider fanboy,” Gregori laughs. \n“Having such a powerful tool makes a big difference. Features like IL Viewer, Type Hierarchy, code inspections, and Structure View help me understand exactly how each part of the compiler and runtime interact. Even in the free version, Rider gives me everything I need to explore G# at a low level.”\n\n            \nGregori Felicio\n                                                                Creator of GSharp, Senior Software Developer\n                                    \nFor Gregori, the free for non-commercial use license embodies what he loves about the JetBrains community. “I think it’s an amazing idea,” he says. “It’s a great entry point for developers to understand and experiment with the tool without any pressure. Not everyone has access to professional-grade software, and this kind of license really opens the door for people to learn, explore, and create freely. It’s a fantastic way to encourage creativity and innovation.”\nA different kind of AI-powered learning tool\nWhen developer Chris Lopes joined Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, he soon found himself immersed in a project helping the faculty reimagine how AI could fit into the classroom. And yet, working with two professors – one in English and one in business – he built ZagAI, a learning assistant designed to help educators leverage AI in their teaching safely and intentionally.\nThe idea originated from the English professor, who had already built a small, custom GPT for his writing classes. “He was very passionate about AI,” Chris recalls. “But there were limitations to that initial setup, because he was relying on students to self-report on their experience”. The professor wanted something more structured and more transparent – and that’s when Chris stepped in. \nWith his years of experience as a .NET developer, Chris began designing what would become ZagAI. “Since I’m the only developer, Blazor Server offered the best productivity,” he says. “I’m using it for both the frontend and backend, and it’s deployed to Azure. We’re using Cosmos DB as both a document database as well as a vector database, and Azure AI Foundry for all AI interactions.”\nThe tool allows professors to design assignments that use an AI-assisted Socratic approach. A student’s progress through the assignment is achieved through dialogue, with helpful pointers and questions probing for deeper insight and reflection. This workflow is deliberately different from many other AI learning solutions. \n“A lot of tools focus on providing quick answers or forming assessments,” Chris says. “It feeds into concerns professors have about AI – that it’s all shortcuts and no profound learning. What we’re doing feels different. The questions ZagAI asks take effort to work through, but they lead to real learning.”\nAn unexpected benefit of working with ZagAI has been how the process of setting up an assignment encourages instructors to articulate their teaching philosophy more clearly. “Professors prompt the AI on how to interact with the student and what knowledge to reference,” Chris says. “The prompt can be made to reflect each professor’s individual pedagogical style and their learning objectives. Having to put all that down in the form of instructions for the AI is making them think more deeply about their teaching.”\nWhen it came to development, Rider was an obvious choice for Chris because of its availability on Linux – his OS of choice. “When Rider made a non-commercial license where I could use it without any cost to my current employer, it was like this perfect coming together of things.”\nAsked what part of the project he’s most proud of, Chris doesn’t hesitate. “The collaboration,” he says. \n“It’s not just a developer building something in isolation. We craft it together – I bring the technical side, they bring the educational side. We’re collaborating and working together to create something that makes a real difference.”\n\n            \nChristopher Lopes\n                                                                 ZagAI creator, AI Engineer at Gonzaga University\n                                    \nRight now, ZagAI is being used in three classes, with plans to expand in the next semester. “We’re hoping to have about a dozen professors use it in the spring,” he says. \nIf you have any questions about ZagAI, you can direct them to informatics@gonzaga.edu. \n____________________________________________________________________________\nEach of these stories began as a spark of inspiration – to experiment, to explore a curiosity, or to make something better. Together, they show what’s possible when professional tools are made available to creative minds everywhere, free of charge.\nIf you have a story about how JetBrains Rider or any of our other .NET tools have helped you create, learn, or explore new ideas, we’d love to hear from you.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "DataGrip 2025.3, the final major update of the year, is here! Let’s take a look at what it has to offer.\n\n\n\n\nDownload DataGrip 2025.3 \nMigration from query consoles to query files\nPreviously, when referring to the SQL files that are attached to a data source by default, we used the term query console, and their workflow had a few issues. We’ve switched to the term query files, which reflects their nature more of these files properly. These files will now be part of your IDE project, but you’ll have to carry out a migration step first.\nThe files can be migrated automatically and all in one go, in which case they will end up in the queries subdirectory of your project directory by default. You can also customize your migration options if you’d prefer to specify which consoles you want to migrate and their new locations. Existing consoles will remain in the software for one more release cycle. To learn more about the improvements, read our blog post about the change.\n\n\n\n\nConnectivity\nYou can now connect to your AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure cloud account, browse the databases stored in it, and then create a data source for any of them. DataGrip keeps your cloud account connection configuration in the Data Sources and Drivers dialog.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve made the introspection levels feature available for Amazon Redshift databases. It allows DataGrip to automatically adjust the amount of loaded metadata based on the database size.\n\n\n\n\nFolders in the database explorer\nWe’ve redesigned the folders in the database explorer so that you can rearrange them in any way that works for you. You can now also create empty folders. Pre-existing folders from the previous version are automatically converted to the new configuration. The configuration of the folders is stored in .idea/db-forest-config.xml.\n\n\n\n\nExplain Plan\nThe Explain Plan actions are more accessible now. You can invoke any of them using the Explain Plan button on the code editor toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nFor a query execution plan, AI Assistant can explain it to you and also suggest optimizations using the new AI-based explanation and optimization features. Explanations and suggestions are provided in the chat, where you can also ask any additional questions you might have about the plan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode editor\nDataGrip keeps track of the queries you run in files. The Query History dialog that stores them can be opened in any code editor tab if the file has an attached data source. Now, you can remove any record from the record list in this dialog.\n\n\n\n\nSnowflake database functionality now offers support for сlasses, including introspection as well as DDL and method call syntax.\n\n\n\n\nWorking with data\nThe database explorer now displays hierarchical Redis keys properly, in accordance with a key separator that you can specify in the data source settings. For instance, keys with names like user::<segment_01>::<segment_02>, where :: is a separator, have views like the following:\n\n\n\n\nFor Microsoft SQL Server, we’ve introduced support for clustered and nonclustered columnstore indexes, as well as the VECTOR and JSON data types. You can work with them in the Create and Modify dialogs. The data types are also available in code completion suggestions, and they are highlighted properly in the code editor.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve made it easier to access the action that clears local filters for a grid. In the latest version of DataGrip, to clear the local filter for all columns, click Table Result Local Filter on the data editor toolbar and then click Clear Local Filter For All Columns.\n\n\n\n\nUI and UX improvements\nWith the redesigned main menu, it is easier to find the most useful actions. We have restructured each section of the menu and cleared out some of the clutter.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the Islands interface theme introduced earlier this year is now the default theme.\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re interested in upgrading to DataGrip 2025.3, or if you have any questions or suggestions, here are a few links you might find useful:\nDownload DataGrip 2025.3.\nVisit our What’s New page for the full list of improvements.\nContact us on X.\nReport any bugs to our issue tracker.\n\n\n\n\nThe DataGrip team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article is brought to you by Mdu Sibisi, draft.dev.\nLong build times interfere with developer momentum, disrupt flow states, and negatively impact productivity. While seemingly minor gaps in work rate may appear negligible in the moment, they quickly accumulate into significant increases in release cycle times and infrastructure costs. (There’s a reason high-performance development teams run their CI/CD pipelines several times a day).\nWhile it’s tempting to reach for the latest software or methodology that promises to maximize your engineering team’s output, carelessly swapping tools with a trial-and-error-like approach isn’t a good idea: Premature adoption can often do more harm than good. It’s far more effective to adopt a strategy informed by data, where you first identify leaks and performance bottlenecks and remedy them accordingly.\nAfter all, you must ensure your team is using the most optimal tools and that they’re using those tools optimally.\nThis guide offers a three-phase blueprint for achieving significant CI/CD pipeline performance boosts that will stick around even as you scale:\nIdentify: Pinpoint pipeline flaws.\nOptimize: Apply effective solutions.\nContinuously improve: Apply long-term strategies to avert future faults.\nPhase 1: Assess performance and identify bottlenecks\nBefore attempting any optimization, first assess the current performance of your pipeline and identify the causes of poor performance. This allows you to make informed improvements and prove their value.\nTime is one of the most reliable and straightforward metrics to start with, particularly in the early stages of your pipeline audit:\nHow long does full pipeline completion take (from commit to production)?\nWhat is the average duration of each pipeline stage (build, test, and deploy)?\nWhich steps consistently take the longest?\nAlso, it’s important to survey or speak to developers about their time perception of the pipeline, and observe their behavior. They may be batching work or avoiding commits due to long feedback cycles.\nThey might even be avoiding experimentation based on unhealthy cultures centered around “waiting for the build”.\nUse the data gathered from these sources to set and adjust your benchmarks and service-level agreements, such as build duration (time) and CPU cores or memory usage (resource utilization).\nYou don’t necessarily have to start with granular benchmarks and monitoring criteria per stage or process. You can keep it as broad as measuring overall pipeline completion time for the sake of simplicity.\nWhile legacy platforms might hide away data in text logs, modern CI/CD platforms provide you with the visibility you need to assess performance out of the box. \nIn TeamCity, the Statistics dashboard provides deeper insights into the performance of each build:\n\n\n\n\nThis view visualizes recent and historical build data using key metrics like build duration, success rate, test count, artifact size, and queue time. You can also create custom charts to track the metrics that matter the most to your business.\nFor a more granular view, the Build Time report shows the time taken by each stage of your pipeline so you can pinpoint the most significant bottlenecks:\n\n\n\n\nBy default, TeamCity attaches its Performance Monitor to each of your build configurations created from a URL. This provides you with a handy way of tracking resource utilization:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the Performance Monitor (and a host of other build features), TeamCity’s notifier can trigger real-time alerts for any important build events (such as fails, successful completions, or hangs) via email or Slack.\nPhase 2: Optimize performance\nOnce you know what’s not working, you want to identify the highest-impact changes your team can make to boost performance.\nAvoid initiatives that may break the system or result in widespread interruptions, like upgrading build tools without validating downstream dependencies or switching shell or OS environments. Small incremental changes that can be isolated are the least likely to disrupt your team’s productivity and the easiest to trace and roll back if something goes wrong.\nSome sure-fire techniques that are usually relatively simple to apply include the following:\nBuild caches: Cache external (package manager) dependencies and build artifacts.\nParallelization: Run tests in parallel across agents or containers, splitting test suites by file, type, or historical timing data. You can also build microservices or modules concurrently.\nModularization: Break monolithic pipelines into modular build configurations.\nSelective and incremental building: Use VCS triggers and path filters to build only affected modules. Use build fingerprint or checksums to avoid rebuilding unchanged components.\nTeamCity’s built-in features can help your team achieve several quick wins.For example, the build caches can be enabled to intelligently reuse compiled artifacts and dependencies:\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, using a build cache reduced the build time by 73 percent. (Keep in mind that the time you’ll save depends on the complexity of your build and which files you choose to cache.)\nArtifact dependencies let you reuse files and curb any redundant compilation or build steps, allowing for pipeline modularization and faster executions:\n\n\n\n\nTeamCity’s architecture allows tests to run in parallel using separate build agents. So instead of two (or more) builds running consecutively, they’ll run simultaneously, providing faster feedback to developers and thus shortening the release cycle:\n\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Continuously improve\nPerformance is not a one-off fix; it must be continually monitored and sustained as your team and codebase scale.\nKeep the following three considerations in mind to ensure continuous improvement:\nUse elastic infrastructure that can scale up to meet peak demand and scale down to save costs.\nDesign pipelines that only build what has changed to speed up builds.\nCreate a culture of performance: Empower your team with the necessary visibility and tools to track trends, catch regressions, and implement improvements.\nTeamCity supports continuous improvement, regardless of your scale. Its cloud profiles let you manage cloud agents on AWS, Azure, or GCP so you can scale infrastructure up and down to meet demand.\nWhen it comes to orchestration, you can use features like snapshot dependencies to create build chains that only build the components impacted by change, which is crucial for managing microservices architecture and speeding up builds. Build templates, on the other hand, allow your team to define a configuration once and apply it across multiple projects, which simplifies updates and maintenance.\nFinally, TeamCity’s audit log and historical performance reports offer the transparency and accountability needed for a performance-oriented culture by letting you track changes and share successes with stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\nYou can even use TeamCity’s REST API to export data into external tools such as Grafana and Excel to present to stakeholders.\nConclusion\nImplementing meaningful change is not always easy. However, by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks and measuring progress, you and your team will be rewarded with visible improvements in product output and quality. Use this positive feedback to maintain your momentum.\nWhile addressing process bottlenecks is crucial to improving performance, the tools your team uses also shape the way they work. Legacy CI/CD tools that require extensive customization, external plugins, and specialized expertise often hinder performance because they keep teams stuck in ineffective workloads.\nIf you’re secretly wondering whether your CI/CD setup is holding back your team, be sure to check out the following resources:\nIs your CI/CD tool helping or hindering performance?\nThe migration decision framework: Quantify the risk of your legacy system to determine whether migration is worth consideration or not.",

For developers who rely on up-to-date or esoteric answers, this gap can be a real frustration. \n\nURL Context: Bringing the web into Copilot Chat \nWith the new URL context feature, Copilot Chat can now access and use information directly from web pages you specify. By pasting a URL into your Copilot Chat prompt, you empower Copilot to pull real-time, relevant information from the source. This means more tailored responses. \n\nHow to use reference URLs in Copilot Chat \nGetting started is easy. When you need Copilot to answer using a specific web resource, simply paste the desired URL into your chat prompt. Copilot will then process the contents of that page, giving you context-aware answers that go beyond its original training. This opens the door to more personalized support. \nLimitations to keep in mind \nWhile the URL context feature is powerful, there are a few things to remember. Copilot’s ability to extract and understand content depends on the accessibility of the web page and the clarity of its information. Some sites might have authentication restrictions or have dynamic content that limit Copilot’s ability to read the web page’s content. Always review responses for accuracy and completeness, especially when referencing complex or highly technical sources. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!

This new version can better assist you with several performance improvements, a redesigned user experience, and a major leap in AI-driven development. Read more about it here and get started with VS 2026 today!\nBelow updates are all available in Visual Studio 2026 only. \nGitHub Cloud Agent Preview is now available in Visual Studio\nThe Cloud Agent is now in preview and ready to help you offload repetitive or time-consuming work. Enable it via the Copilot badge dropdown → Settings & Options → Coding Agent (Preview).\nNote: You’ll need to restart Visual Studio after enabling.\n Requires: A solution connected to a GitHub repo.\nOnce enabled, you can delegate tasks directly from Visual Studio—UI cleanups, refactors, doc updates, multi-file edits, and anything you want Copilot to draft so you can review later.\nWe’re actively improving this experience, and your feedback is essential. Soon, you’ll see direct PR links inside Visual Studio, so you can review agent-generated changes without breaking your flow.\nWe’re excited to help you work faster by letting the Cloud Agent handle the tedious parts while you stay focused on building and debugging the core of your project.\nCopilot Actions in your Context Menu\nWe are excited to announce that you can now interact with Copilot directly from your context menu in Visual Studio! With just one click, you can now get Copilot’s assistance with no typing required. Whether you are looking to quickly generate comments or explanations of a class, Copilot is right there when you need it.\n\nNote that “Optimize Selection” requires you to select code to trigger. Copilot will analyze the selected code and its surrounding context, offering targeted suggestions directly in the editor. Copilot will suggest improvements in performance, maintainability, reliability, and architecture.\nCopilot Intent Detection for All-In-One Search\nHave you ever forgotten the name of a file while coding, and thus couldn’t search or find it easily? The new Did You Mean feature is here to help! When you search using All-In-One Search and Copilot detects a better match than the top result – perhaps because of a typo or a fuzzy memory – it will suggest what you might have meant.\nWhen you type a search term, Copilot analyzes your input and suggests a more relevant term if it finds one that more closely matches your intent. This feature helps with whether the search results are empty or when the top result isn’t what you intended.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/DidYouMeanVideo.mp4\n\nThank you for reading till the end!

Muscle memory doesn’t mess around. We wrestle with this every time someone suggest a “quick” shortcut change. It’s not just editing a keybinding but navigating a history that makes Visual Studio so customizable for developers like us.\nPicture yourself deep in code, chugging coffee, ready to close a tab. You hit Ctrl+W because Chrome, VS Code, and every other tool uses it. But in Visual Studio? You likely need Ctrl+F4, a combo straight out of the Windows 98 era. Or maybe you try commenting out a line if code with Ctrl+/, a standard elsewhere, but Visual Studio adopted it late. Why? The team isn’t clueless – every shortcut ties to years of workflows we depend on.\nLet’s walk through why that history powers Visual Studio and why changing a shortcut like Ctrl+W is such a challenge.\nOne command, multiple shortcuts\nVisual Studio lets you handle the same task with different shortcuts to match your workflow. To close a tab, you can hit Ctrl+F4, a go-to for longtime users. If you come from tools like VS Code or Chrome and prefer Ctrl+W, Visual Studio supports that too. This flexibility rocks – you stick with what you know or adopt newer standards without losing your groove.\nBut it gets tricky. Many key combos in Visual Studio already do something and reassigning one can disrupt established workflows. For example, Ctrl+W closes tabs in most tools, but in Visual Studio, it selects the current word – a shortcut coders have relied on since the 2000s. If that’s wired into your fingers, changing it could derail you. Visual Studio keeps both shortcuts, letting you use what works while supporting everyone else’s habits.\nThat ability to support multiple shortcuts is just the start of Visual Studio’s customization, though – it goes deeper with how it tailors the IDE to you.\nDeveloper profiles\nWhen you launch Visual Studio, it doesn’t throw you into a generic setup. It prompts you to choose a developer profile – General, Web, C#, C++, and others. This choice shapes your shortcuts, layout, and entire coding experience to fit how you work. Visual Studio’s history of letting developers carry over habits from other IDEs or editors ensures your shortcuts feel right from the start.\nHere’s the catch: the same command can use different shortcuts based on your profile. In the C# profile, you build a solution with F6. In the General profile, you hit Ctrl+Shift+B. It’s not chaos – it stems from years of developers like us telling the team what fits our work.\nProfiles aren’t the only way Visual Studio adapts to your coding style, though – there’s another layer that makes switching tools even smoother.\nKeyboard schemes\nTo make jumping between tools less jarring, Visual Studio offers keyboard schemes – like VS Code’s shortcuts or ReSharper’s keymap. It’s like plugging your own keyboard into a shared machine. These schemes build on Visual Studio’s history of supporting diverse coding styles, letting you dive in without starting from scratch.\n\nBut with all this customization, how do we know what shortcuts you’re actually using and why? That’s where things get murky.\nThe intent behind the shortcut\nWhen we consider changing a shortcut, we dig into telemetry to see how you use Visual Studio. It reveals which shortcuts you hit, how often, and when. But here’s the tough part: it doesn’t explain why. If you press Ctrl+W, do you select a word, as Visual Studio intends, or expect to close a tab because VS Code or Chrome does that? We see the keypresses, but your intent remains a mystery.\nThat’s where the art lies. Some of us rely on Ctrl+W for its original role; others follow muscle memory from another tool. Without knowing who’s who, changing a shortcut risk breaking someone’s workflow.\nThis uncertainty complicates things further when you factor in how Visual Studio organizes shortcuts behind the scenes.\nScopes\nVisual Studio’s commanding system has a killer feature: scoped shortcuts. Every shortcut applies to a specific scope, so you can bind the same shortcut to different commands in different contexts. To close a tab with Ctrl+W, we register it in the Global scope. But any scope can override that. For example, Ctrl+W selects the current word in the Text Editor scope. The active scope depends on where your focus is – the editor, Solution Explorer, or another tool window.\nTo remap Ctrl+W to close tabs, we register it in the Global scope and ensure no other scope overrides it. This setup gives you flexibility but adds complexity when changing shortcuts, as we must account for every scope’s bindings.\nAnd just when you think you’ve got a handle on that, another wrinkle shows up in how some shortcuts are structured.\nSequenced shortcuts\nVisual Studio supports sequenced shortcuts, where you press multiple keys to trigger a command. For example, in the Text Editor scope, Ctrl+E, Ctrl+W toggles word wrap. Many sequenced shortcuts start with Ctrl+E, followed by another key. If we bind a command to just Ctrl+E, it fires immediately, cutting off any chance for the second key in the sequence to register. This breaks all those Ctrl+E-based sequences, as Visual Studio stops listening for additional keypresses once it detects Ctrl+E.\nThis means we must carefully check existing sequences before assigning single-key shortcuts to avoid breaking workflows that rely on multi-key combos.\nWith all these layers – multiple shortcuts, profiles, schemes, scopes, sequences, and unknown user intent – changing a shortcut becomes a high-stakes juggling act.\nThe balancing act\nEvery shortcut in Visual Studio connects to our coding habits – late-night bug hunts, team workflows we’ve refined for years. When we add or change a shortcut, we don’t just pick a new key. We examine the entire keyboard, identify what’s in use, and sometimes shuffle other shortcuts to make room. For instance, if we set Ctrl+W to close tabs to align with modern tools, we might need to reassign “Select Current Word” to avoid leaving anyone stranded. It’s a delicate balance to keep every developer’s flow intact, and that history of customization makes Visual Studio ours.\nCtrl+W in Visual Studio 2026\nThis walked you through the process we followed to map Ctrl+W to close the current tab in Visual Studio 2026. For C# profile users, we held off on this change to avoid disrupting existing workflows, especially given potential conflicts with sequenced shortcuts. If you’re using the C# profile and want Ctrl+W to close tabs, you can easily set it up yourself in the keybinding settings.\nWhat’s next?\nSo, what shortcuts do you want to see next? Got a key combo you need or one that’s driving you nuts? Throw it in the comments – the team’s reading, and your input could help steer where Visual Studio goes from here.\nResources\nKeyboard Hero: An extension that teaches you the shortcuts you didn’t use\nVideo: How do keyboard shortcuts work?\nIdentify and customize keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio\nThe post Why changing keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio isn’t as simple as it seems appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In Visual Studio 2026 we introduced Copilot Profiler Agent, a new AI-powered assistant that helps you analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks in your code. By combining the power of GitHub Copilot with Visual Studio’s performance profiler, you can now ask natural language questions about performance, get insights into hot paths, and quickly identify optimization opportunities. Let’s walk through a real-world example of how this tool can help you make meaningful performance improvements. \nBenchmarking a real project\nTo demonstrate the capabilities of the Copilot Profiler Agent, let’s optimize CsvHelper, a popular open-source project. You can follow along by cloning my fork of the repo then checking out to right before my fix that we will detail below with git checkout 435ff7c. If you just want to see it in action you can watch along in our toolbox episode demonstrating this.\nIn one of my previous blog posts I added a CsvHelper.Benchmarks project that contains a benchmark for reading CSV records. This time I want to see if we can optimize writing CSV records instead. Normally I would start this investigation by creating a benchmark for the code that I want to optimize, and while we will still do that we can have Copilot do the toil work for us. In the Copilot Chat window I can ask @Profiler Help me write a benchmark for the #WriteRecords method. The @Profiler gets us talking directly with the Copilot Profiler agent and #WriteRecords tells it exactly the method we are interested in benchmarking. \nFrom here Copilot starts creating our new benchmark, asking us if its ok to install the profiler’s NuGet package to pull information from the benchmarks when it runs it. It also models the benchmarks after any existing benchmarks that it finds so the resulting benchmark is very similar to the one we already wrote keeping things consistent with the style of the repository. Lastly, it kicks off a build to make sure everything is good.\n\nOnce it’s done, it provides some useful follow-up prompts to start the investigation. We could click one of these to launch into our investigation, though I want to edit things slightly in the benchmark.\n\nI tweaked the benchmark to have a few more fields for us to write, in this case 2 int fields and 2 string fields. When I originally had Copilot do this, before writing it up for this blog, instead of writing to the same memory stream it wrote to a new one each time. Writing into the same memory stream is probably the better way to go about things, you win this time Copilot, but in my original PR to CsvHelper I didn’t and it should be fine.\npublic class BenchmarkWriteCsv \r\n{ \r\n    private const int entryCount = 10000; \r\n    private readonly List records = new(entryCount); \r\n\r\n    public class Simple \r\n    { \r\n        public int Id1 { get; set; } \r\n        public int Id2 { get; set; } \r\n        public string Name1 { get; set; } \r\n        public string Name2 { get; set; } \r\n    } \r\n\r\n    [GlobalSetup] \r\n    public void GlobalSetup() \r\n    { \r\n        var random = new Random(42); \r\n        var chars = new char[10]; \r\n\r\n        string getRandomString() \r\n        { \r\n            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) \r\n                chars[i] = (char)random.Next('a', 'z' + 1); \r\n            return new string(chars); \r\n        } \r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < entryCount; ++i) \r\n        { \r\n            records.Add(new Simple \r\n            { \r\n                Id1 = random.Next(), \r\n                Id2 = random.Next(), \r\n                Name1 = getRandomString(), \r\n                Name2 = getRandomString(), \r\n            }); \r\n        } \r\n    } \r\n\r\n    [Benchmark] \r\n    public void WriteRecords() \r\n    { \r\n        using var stream = new MemoryStream(); \r\n        using var streamWriter = new StreamWriter(stream); \r\n        using var writer = new CsvHelper.CsvWriter(streamWriter, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); \r\n        writer.WriteRecords(records); \r\n        streamWriter.Flush(); \r\n    } \r\n} \nGetting insight into the benchmark\nNow to get started with the analysis I can either ask Profiler Agent to run the benchmark or just click on the follow up prompt for @Profiler Run the benchmark and analyze results. From here Copilot edits my main method which at first glance might seem odd but when looking at the changes I see it made the necessary changes to use BenchmarkSwitcher so it can choose which benchmarks to run:\nstatic void Main(string[] args)\r\n{\r\n    // Use assembly-wide discovery so all benchmarks in this assembly are run,\r\n    // including the newly added BenchmarkWriteRecords.\r\n    _ = BenchmarkSwitcher.FromAssembly(typeof(BenchmarkEnumerateRecords).Assembly).Run(args);\r\n}\nThen it kicks off a benchmarking run and when it’s done I’m presented with a diagsession where we can begin investigating.\nUsing Copilot Profiler Agent to find bottlenecks\nNow comes the exciting part. After running the benchmark, the Profiler agent analyzes the trace and highlights where time is spent. I can ask the Profiler Agent questions about the trace and have it explain why code is slow or why certain optimizations could help. It has already pointed out that most of the time is spent in delegate compilation and invocation, which is done for each field in the CSV record. For a record with 4 fields written 10,000 times, that means 40,000 delegate invocations. Each invocation has overhead, and this is showing up as a hot path in the profiler.\n\nI can ask the Profiler Agent: “How can I reduce the delegate invocation overhead?” or “Why is delegate invocation slow” and the agent like a patient teacher will explain concepts and suggest fixes.\nImplementing the fix\nI’m going to click the @Profiler Optimize library to produce a single compiled write delegate (reduce multicast invokes) and see what it comes up with. The Profiler Agent makes an edit to ObjectRecordWriter and I can click on that in the chat window to see the diff of the changes it makes.\nLooking at the current implementation, the code builds a list of delegates, one for each field:\nvar delegates = new List<Action>();\r\n\r\nforeach (var memberMap in members)\r\n{\r\n    // ... field writing logic ...\r\n\r\n    delegates.Add(Expression.Lambda<Action>(writeFieldMethodCall, recordParameter).Compile());\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar action = CombineDelegates(delegates) ?? new Action((T parameter) => { });\r\nreturn action;\nThe issue is that CombineDelegates creates a multicast delegate which invokes each individual delegate separately in series. Instead, Profiler Agent is suggesting we use Expression.Block to combine all the expressions before compiling:\nvar expressions = new List<Expression>(members.Count);\r\n\r\nforeach (var memberMap in members)\r\n{\r\n    // ... field writing logic ...\r\n\r\n    expressions.Add(writeFieldMethodCall);\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (expressions.Count == 0)\r\n{\r\n    return new Action<T>((T parameter) => { });\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Combine all field writes into a single block\r\nvar block = Expression.Block(expressions);\r\nreturn Expression.Lambda<Action<T>>(block, recordParameter).Compile();\nThis change is small but elegant: instead of creating multiple delegates and invoking them sequentially, we create a single block expression containing all the field writes, then compile it once. Now all fields are written in a single call when we invoke the delegate for each record, with no additional delegate overhead.\nMeasuring the impact\nAfter making this change, Copilot automatically reruns the benchmarks to measure the improvement. The results show approximately 24% better performance in this run with the profiler. Our previously staged PR for CsvHelper shows ~15% better performance. The CPU profiler confirms that we’ve eliminated the delegate invocation overhead and instead of 40,000 delegate calls for our 10,000 records with 4 fields each, we now have just 10,000 delegate calls.\n\nThis is a meaningful win for a library that’s already heavily optimized. For applications writing large CSV files with many fields, this improvement translates directly to reduced CPU time and faster processing. And because CsvHelper has millions of downloads, this optimization benefits a huge number of users. From here I went ahead and staged the PR, though Copilot helpfully provides more follow up prompts regarding the type conversion and ShouldQuote logic so that I could continue to improve performance further.\nThe power of Copilot Profiler Agent\nWhat makes this workflow powerful is the combination of precise performance data from the Visual Studio Profiler with the analytical and code generation capabilities of Copilot. Instead of manually digging through CPU traces and trying to understand what the hot paths mean, you can ask natural language questions, get actionable insights, and quickly test ideas.\nThe agent doesn’t just tell you what’s slow – it helps you understand why it’s slow and suggests concrete ways to fix it. In this case, it identified that delegate invocation overhead was the bottleneck and suggested the Expression.Block optimization, which is exactly the right solution for this problem. It even reran the benchmarks to confirm the optimization!\nLet us know what you think\nWe’ve shown how the Copilot Profiler Agent can help you take a real-world project, identify performance bottlenecks through natural language queries, and make meaningful improvements backed by data. The measure/change/measure cycle becomes much faster when you can ask questions about your performance data and get intelligent answers. We’d love to hear what you think!\nShare your feedback\n\nThe post Profiler Agent – Delegate the analysis, not the performance appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

AI와 어떻게 공존해야 하나.\n약 3년 정도 AI관련 뉴스를 읽어보고, 저명한 연구가들의 발표를 보면서 느끼는 점은, 고정 관념을 빨리 벗어날수록 다른 가능성을 찾기가 더 쉬울 것 같다는 것이었다. 현상을 보지 말고 큰 흐름을 좀 더 보도록 하는 것 같다. 특정 분야의 정보를 오랫 동안 공부하고, 산업에 적용해 보고, 그 분야의 문제들의 해법을 알고 있는 사람을 전문가라고 하는데 AI의 등장은 세상의 이미 알려진 문제들에 대해서 몇 번의 질답으로 거의 정답에 가까운 정보를 찾게 해 주며 전문가의 가치를 점점 더 희미하게 만드는 것 같다. 기업들은 AI를 투자와 소득의 관점에서 도입하는 일종의 도구로 인식하는 것 같다. 그러면서 자신이 곧 의미없어질 수도 있는 하던 일에 AI를 도입해서 자동화시키기를 강요한다. 이 얼마나 이율배반적인 조직 운영인가. 차라리 외부 기업에 외주를 주어서 하면 모를까.\n몇몇 명제를 놓고 생각을 해 본다.\nAI가 해야 할 일과 사람이 해야 할 일\nAI의 context window가 사실상 무한에 가까워지면서, 사람이 과연 어떤 가치를 유지할 수 있을까에 대한 생각을 가장 오래 해 왔던 것 같다. 우선 AI는 기존의 정보에 대한 트레이닝으로 지식을 가지고 있기 때문에 기존에 존재하지 않았던 연구나 아이디어에 대해서는 새로 만드는 데 한계가 있다. 두 가지 정도의 부류가 있을 것 같은데, 우선 공학적인 연구의 경우는 현실 세계에서 반복된 실험으로 진보를 해 나아가야 하기 때문에 AI스스로는 보조적인 역할만 할 수 있을 것 같다. 두 번째의 경우는 새로운 개념 — 컨셉 — 에 대한 정의를 해야 하는 경우이다. 사람은 새로운 시대에 트렌드를 임의로 만들어나가거나, 사회적으로 관찰되는 현상에 대한 신조어를 창조해내거나, 정치적으로 함께 고민해야 하는 과제에 대해 프로파간다를 만들기도 한다. 앞서 공학적인 연구가 실제 물리 세계에 대한 이해와 실험에서 출발한다면, 이 경우는 개인으로서의 사람과 집단으로서의 사람에 대한 이해와 실험에서 출발한다고 볼 수 있을 것 같다. 이런 분야에서의 고민과 연구에서 AI가 주체가 되는 일은 어려운 것 같다.\n앞서 생각한 것이 진보적인 측면이었다면 반대로 소모적인 측면의 일도 고민할 수 있을 것 같다. 일관된 인내심을 요하는 일, 일관된 근로를 요하는 일의 경우는 AI나 AI와 결합된 로봇으로 해결하게 될 일이 되겠지만, 공감과 교감을 요하는 일의 경우는 아무리 AI가 발전한다고 한들 한계가 있을 것 같다. 미세한 시선 교환, 적절한 톤의 목소리, 체온의 교환과 같은 것들은 근시일내에 사람을 대체할 부분은 아닌 것 같다. 그리고 믿음과 확신을 심어주고 책임을 담당해 주는 리더쉽도 AI가 대신할 수는 없을 것 같다. 누구나 거부감 없이 들을 만 한 멘트는 AI가 할 수 있지만, 미묘한 표정 변화나 목소리 변화에서 상대방의 정서를 포착하여 가장 적합한 방식으로 대응하는 것도 AI만으로는 할 수 없는 일 같다.\n회사: 함께 일한다는 것의 의미\n회사에서 여러 사람들과 더불어 일하는 직업이라는 것도 많이 바뀌게 될 것 같다. 애초에 회사라는 것이 왜 있었는가. 같은 방향의 이득을 추구하는 사람들이 모여서, 자본을 응축하고 산업에서의 경쟁력과 격차를 유지하며, 그걸 기반으로 수익을 창출하는 시스템이 아닌가. 그래서 회사에서는 각종 자료와 도움을 받을 수 있는 동료라는 자원으로 비즈니스 문제를 해결해가며 수익을 얻어내는 것이 아니었을까. 그런데, 특허와 같은 지적 재산권이 걸려 있든 아니든 알려진 모든 정보에 대해 접근성과 이해도를 채팅 몇 번으로 얻을 수 있다면 회사가 보유했던 자료와 동료가 그렇게 큰 의미가 있을까? 만약 그렇다면 10인 이상의 인원으로 회사를 유지한다면 그 이유는 무엇일까? 이미 큰 기업들에서는 신규 인원을 채용하기 전에 해당 직무가 왜 AI로 해결이 안 되는지를 증명해야 한다고 한다. 현실적이지 않아 보이지만, 언듯 보면 합리적인 방향성으로 보이기도 한다. AI보다 못한 신규 직원을, 어떤 이유로 합리성을 증명하며 채용할 수 있을까.\n지독하게 근본적인 의미에 대한 탐구\n일론 머스크는 미래에는 재화가 사실상 무한대에 가까울 것이라고 한다. 그리고 돈이라는 것은 근본적으로 노동력을 저장한 데이터베이스에 불과하기 때문에 미래에는 돈이라는 것이 쓸모가 없어질 것이라고 한다. 지독하게도 반박할 수 없는 정의이다. 자본주의 국가에서 사람들은 생존을 위해 노동을 하고, 그 증거를 데이터베이스로 저장 => 통화로 통장에 보존하고, 그걸 소비하며 살아간다. 만약 전 지구적으로 이 모든 문제를 해결할 준비가 되어 있다면, 직업은 선택적으로만 갖게 될 것이고, 그렇기에 지금과는 완전히 달라질 것이라는 거다. 그리고 미래에는 다른 재화로는 비교 우위를 갖기 힘들고, 결국 컴퓨팅 파워로 전환되는 에너지만 의미를 갖게 된다고 한다.\n그러면서 일론 머스크는 돈을 벌 생각을 하지 말고, 순수하게 인류 문명에 기여하는 일을 많이 하라고 한다. 어차피 돈이라는 것은 가치가 0에 수렴하게 될 것이기 때문에, 실제로 의미있는 무언가를 만들어나가는 것 만이 의미를 갖게 될 것이라고 한다. 엔트로피를 역행하는 무언가를 하라고 한다.\n(출처: https://x.com/AIBopyo/status/1995137529469612370)\n그렇다면 해야 할 일은 개인적으로 의미있는 성장을 하고 다수의 인류에게 보탬이 되는 일을 해야 한다는 것으로 정리가 되는 것 같다. 보다 원론적이고 원천적인 이런 방향성에 매우 동감하게 된다.\n다수의 인류에 보탬이 된다는 것은 무엇일까. 최근까지 세상에서 큰 일이라고 비견되어 온 일들을 어떻게 해석하는 것이 바람직할까.\n새로운 것을 만든다는 것\n새로운 컨셉을 만드는 것. 기존에 존재하지 않던 관계와 영향력을 가지고 있는 무언가를 만드는 것. 자전거나 비행기 등.\n사람이 해야 하는 일은 무엇일까\n사람은 수명이 허락하는 한, 단기적으로 세상을 독자적인 방식으로 보고, 독자적인 방식으로 평가하는 하나의 필터라고 생각\n정치라는 것은 무엇일까\n어떤 사람이 다른 사람에게 자신의 시야를 일부 공유함으로써, 비슷하게 보는 필터를 늘리거나, 좀 더 오랫동안 존재하도록 만드는 행위\n필터에 불과한 사람으로써 더 의미있는 일을 하려면\n아마도 세상의 복잡도를 줄이는 역할을 하는 게 아닐까. 세상에 존재했던 불필요한 사이클릭 루트들을 탐구하여 조금이라도 심플하게 만드는 것 아닐까. 그러면서 물리 세상과 사람의 마음, 사람의 생화학적 반응에 대해 더 잘 이해해서 일생 동안 더 많은 시간 연애하는 것과 비슷한 수준의 행복을 유지하는 게 아닐까.\n사람에게 어떤 교육을 해야 할까\n이건 그나마 좀 확신을 가지고 적을 수 있을 것 같다. 내가 존재하는 세상에 대해 자세히는 아니더라도 올바르게 이해하고, 내가 얻는 만족에 대해 올바르게 이해하고, 내가 세상과 사람을 바라보는 방식을 오랫 동안 fine-tuning하면서 나의 만족을 계속 증가시킬 수 있는 필터를 만들어 나갈 수 있는 교육을 해야 하지 않을까. 그러기 위해서는 교육기관에서는 조금이라도 세상에 대해 올바르게 알려주고, 주변 사람들은 자신을 잘 표현하고 잘 이해할 수 있도록 경험을 나누고 지도를 해 주어야 하지 않을까. 결국 이게 다가 아닐까.\n철학? 수학? 아니면 과학?\n철학이라는 건 사람들이 올바른 생각을 할 수 있도록 고민한 흔적이라고 생각한다. 여러 학파들이 있지만 100% 진리가 있다기보다, 일종의 생각과 행동의 가드레일 역할을 한 게 아닐까 생각해본다. 수학은 나이가 들 수록 재미있다고 느끼는 부분이, 관계가 있냐 없냐 혹은 있다면 어떤 수준으로 있냐를 매우매우 간략하게 표현하기 때문에 참 아름답다고 생각한다. 하지만 한편으로는 명료하게 표현될 수 있는 방식으로만 컨셉을 만들기 때문에, 적용될 수 있는 데는 한계가 분명히 있다고도 생각한다. 과학은 가설을 세우고 실험과 관찰의 반복을 통해 조금씩 이해를 넓히는 학문인데, 결국 모든 사람이 평생동안 하는 행위가 이게 아닐까 (똑똑하게 하든 멍청하게 하든) 생각한다. 미래에도 많은 선택권을 가지고 많은 가능성이 있는 사람이 되려면 이런 것들에 대한 이해가 충분히 있어야 하지 않을까\n커뮤니케이션과 흥미\n이 둘은 철학, 수학, 과학과 분명히 다르지만 반드시 필요하다고 생각한다. 예전에는 인간은 사회적인 동물이라는 말을 반신반의했는데, 이제는 100% 맞다고 생각한다. 왜냐하면 인간은 다른 인간과 같이 있을 때, 인종/나이/성별/키/몸무게/완력/목소리/능력/재산 등등의 요소를 종합적으로 비교하며 관계를 가정하고, 그 지점서부터 다양한 방식으로 심리적, 감정적 영향을 받기 때문이다. 그리고 흥미(=도파민)도 그 지점에서부터 발생한다. 철학, 수학, 과학이 하드 스킬이라면 커뮤니케이션과 흥미는 하드 스킬에 쓰임새를 만들기 위한 소프트 스킬이 아닐까.\n맺으며\n어렸을 때 어른들로부터 배웠던 세상은, 훌륭한 사람이 되어야 하고, 죽어서 천국에 가기 위해 선행을 해야 하는 것이었던 것 같다. 학습의 결과로 얻게 된 나의 습관으로써는 나쁘지 않았던 것 같기는 하지만, 변화하는 세상에서 그리고 나와 다른 생각을 가지고 있는 사람들과 섞여 있으면서 경험하는 부조리에서 불행한 시간들이 적지 않았었다. 세상에 무한한 가능성을 선물해 준 AI의 시대에 어쩌면, 아주 어쩌면 우리는 처음으로 세상을 대하는 방식을 처음부터 다시 배우고, 좀 더 쉽게 불행을 떨치면서 살 수 있게 될지도 모른다. 그렇다면, 그 다음 뭐가 더 필요하기는 할까?",

높이 추정의 정확도를 나타내는 RMSE(평균제곱근오차)는 대륙별로 1.5미터에서 8.9미터 사이로 나타났으며, 특히 오세아니아와 유럽에서 높은 정확도를 보였다. 데이터 분석 결과, 아시아가 건물 수와 총 부피 면에서 압도적인 비중을 차지하는 반면, 아프리카는 건물 수는 많으나 총 부피가 작아 소규모 또는 비공식 건물이 다수 분포함을 시사했다.&nbsp;</div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

모델의 성능을 높이기 위해 '추출(Extraction)'과 '정규화(Regularization)'라는 두 단계의 네트워크를 직렬로 구성한 점이 특징이다. 첫 번째 네트워크가 위성 영상에서 1차적인 이진 마스크를 생성하면, 동일한 아키텍처를 가진 두 번째 정규화 네트워크가 이를 입력받아 노이즈를 제거하고 건물 경계를 다듬는다. 특히 정규화 네트워크 학습 시에는 깨끗한 폴리곤 마스크에 인위적인 노이즈를 주입한 것을 입력 데이터로 사용하여, 모델이 거친 마스크를 정제된 형태로 복원하는 일종의 디노이징(Denoising) 기능을 수행하도록 훈련시켰다.</div><div><br /></div><div>3D 높이 추정 모델은 HTC-DC Net(Hybrid Transformer-CNN with Dynamic Classification)을 채택했다. 이는 CNN 계열인 EfficientNet-B5를 백본으로 사용하여 이미지의 특징을 추출하고, 비전 트랜스포머(ViT) 인코더를 결합하여 지역적 특징과 전역적 특징 간의 관계를 학습하는 하이브리드 구조이다. 높이 예측 방식으로는 단순한 회귀(Regression) 대신 '분류-회귀(Classification-Regression)' 패러다임을 적용했다. 이는 높이 범위를 먼저 구간별로 분류(Classification)한 뒤, 해당 구간 내에서 미세 값을 회귀로 조정하는 방식으로, 이를 통해 예측의 안정성을 높였다. 학습 데이터로는 전 세계 168개 도시의 항공 LiDAR 데이터에서 추출한 정규화된 디지털 표면 모델(nDSM)을 정답 레이블(Ground Truth)로 활용했다.</div><div><br /></div><div>추론(Inference) 및 배포 단계에서는 모델 예측의 불확실성(Uncertainty)을 정량화하기 위해 테스트 시간 증강(TTA, Test Time Augmentation) 기법을 도입했다. 대용량 위성 영상을 처리할 때 슬라이딩 윈도우 방식을 적용하여 겹치는 영역에 대해 픽셀당 최대 4번의 예측을 수행하고, 이 결과값들의 분산을 계산하여 데이터의 신뢰도 지표로 삼았다. 이러한 딥러닝 파이프라인은 기존 오픈소스 데이터가 커버하지 못하는 지역의 데이터를 생성하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했으나, 아프리카 등 학습 데이터(LiDAR)가 전무한 지역에 대해서는 도메인 적응(Domain Adaptation)의 한계가 존재함을 명시하고 있다.</div></div><div><br /></div><div><b>기술 연구 및 개발 의미</b></div><div>이 연구는 단순한 데이터 구축을 넘어 유엔의 지속가능발전목표(SDG) 11번, 특히 토지 소비율과 인구 증가율의 비율을 모니터링하는 데 있어 단순 면적보다 '건물 부피' 기반 지표가 도시의 개발 상태와 인구 밀도를 더 정확하게 반영함을 입증했다. 1인당 건축 부피와 GDP의 상관관계를 분석한 결과, 부피 기반 지표가 경제 발전 수준을 더 잘 설명하는 것으로 나타났다.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 독일 뮌헨 공과대학교(TUM) 연구팀이 개발하여 공개한 세계 최대 규모의 3D 건물 지도 데이터셋인 글로벌 빌딩 아틀라스(Global Building Atlas) 프로젝트에 대해 설명한다. 특히, 인공지능과 위성 영상 분석 기술을 결합하여 전 세계에 존재하는 건물을 3차원 모델로 구현한 방법을 기술적 관점에서 이야기나눈다.\n\n\n\nLiterally a Map Showing All the Buildings in the World\n이 결과는 오픈소스로 공개되었으며, 기존에 가장 방대하다고 알려진 데이터셋이 포함하던 약 17억 개의 건물 수치를 대폭 상회하는 규모로 개발되었다. 그동안 디지털 지도 데이터에서 소외되었던 아프리카, 남미, 아시아의 농촌 지역 건물들까지 정밀하게 포착해냈다는 점에서 기술적 진보를 보여준다.\n개발과정\n지도의 기반이 된 데이터는 주로 2019년에 촬영된 플래닛스코프(PlanetScope) 위성 이미지를 활용하였으며, 연구팀은 이를 통해 각 건물의 2D 바닥 면적뿐만 아니라 높이 정보까지 정밀하게 추출했다. 이 지도가 제공하는 높이 데이터의 해상도는 3x3미터 수준으로, 기존의 글로벌 건물 높이 데이터셋들이 주로 90미터 해상도에 그쳤던 것과 비교하면 약 30배 이상 정밀도가 향상된 수치이다. 제공되는 데이터는 건물의 대략적인 형태와 높이를 단순화하여 표현하는 LoD1(Level of Detail 1) 수준의 3D 모델 형식을 따르고 있어, 전 지구적 규모의 방대한 데이터를 다루면서도 활용성을 확보했다.\n\n이 연구는 기존 데이터셋이 가진 커버리지의 한계와 3D 정보의 부재를 해결하기 위해 진행되었으며, 전 세계 약 27억 5천만 개의 건물을 포함하는 방대한 규모의 데이터를 구축하였다. 이는 기존의 가장 포괄적인 데이터베이스보다 10억 개 이상 많은 수치로, 그동안 데이터상에서 누락되었던 전 세계 건물의 약 40% 이상을 메우는 성과이다.\n\n\n연구팀은 이 데이터셋 구축을 위해 플래닛스코프(PlanetScope) 위성 이미지만을 사용하는 머신러닝 기반 파이프라인을 개발했다.  이 과정은 크게 건물 폴리곤 생성과 높이 추정의 두 단계로 나뉘며, 기존의 오픈소스 건물 데이터(OpenStreetMap, Google, Microsoft 등)와 자체 생성한 데이터를 '품질 기반 융합 전략'을 통해 결합하여 데이터의 완성도를 극대화했다. 이를 통해 완성된 'GBA-Height'는 3x3미터의 공간 해상도를 제공하는데, 이는 기존 글로벌 제품들이 제공하던 90미터 해상도보다 약 30배 더 정밀한 수준이며 이를 통해 지역 및 전 지구 규모에서 신뢰할 수 있는 건물 부피 분석이 가능해졌다.\n\n\n또한 연구팀은 건물 높이 정보를 포함한 'GBA-LoD1' 모델을 생성하여 약 26억 8천만 건의 건물 인스턴스를 구현했으며, 이는 전체의 97%에 달하는 높은 완성도를 보인다.  높이 추정의 정확도를 나타내는 RMSE(평균제곱근오차)는 대륙별로 1.5미터에서 8.9미터 사이로 나타났으며, 특히 오세아니아와 유럽에서 높은 정확도를 보였다. 데이터 분석 결과, 아시아가 건물 수와 총 부피 면에서 압도적인 비중을 차지하는 반면, 아프리카는 건물 수는 많으나 총 부피가 작아 소규모 또는 비공식 건물이 다수 분포함을 시사했다. \n\n\n\n\n공개된 GlobalBuildingAtlas LoD1 웹 서비스(선릉역, 뉴욕 근처 생성된 3D건물모델)\n\nAI 모델 개발 접근법\n\n인공지능 모델 개발 및 활용 관점에서 본 GlobalBuildingAtlas(GBA) 프로젝트는 3미터 해상도의 단일 시점(Monocular) 위성 영상인 PlanetScope 데이터를 입력으로 받아 전 지구적 규모의 3D 건물 모델을 생성하는 파이프라인을 구축했다는 점에서 기술적 의미가 있다. 전체 시스템은 크게 2D 건물 폴리곤 생성을 위한 의미론적 분할(Semantic Segmentation) 네트워크와 3D 높이 추정을 위한 단안 높이 추정(Monocular Height Estimation) 네트워크로 이원화되어 설계되었다.\n\n\n\n2D 건물 폴리곤 생성 모델의 경우, 연구팀은 UPerNet(Unified Perceptual Parsing Network) 아키텍처를 기반으로 하되 백본(Backbone)으로 ConvNeXt-Tiny를 사용했다.  모델의 성능을 높이기 위해 '추출(Extraction)'과 '정규화(Regularization)'라는 두 단계의 네트워크를 직렬로 구성한 점이 특징이다. 첫 번째 네트워크가 위성 영상에서 1차적인 이진 마스크를 생성하면, 동일한 아키텍처를 가진 두 번째 정규화 네트워크가 이를 입력받아 노이즈를 제거하고 건물 경계를 다듬는다. 특히 정규화 네트워크 학습 시에는 깨끗한 폴리곤 마스크에 인위적인 노이즈를 주입한 것을 입력 데이터로 사용하여, 모델이 거친 마스크를 정제된 형태로 복원하는 일종의 디노이징(Denoising) 기능을 수행하도록 훈련시켰다.\n\n\n3D 높이 추정 모델은 HTC-DC Net(Hybrid Transformer-CNN with Dynamic Classification)을 채택했다. 이는 CNN 계열인 EfficientNet-B5를 백본으로 사용하여 이미지의 특징을 추출하고, 비전 트랜스포머(ViT) 인코더를 결합하여 지역적 특징과 전역적 특징 간의 관계를 학습하는 하이브리드 구조이다. 높이 예측 방식으로는 단순한 회귀(Regression) 대신 '분류-회귀(Classification-Regression)' 패러다임을 적용했다. 이는 높이 범위를 먼저 구간별로 분류(Classification)한 뒤, 해당 구간 내에서 미세 값을 회귀로 조정하는 방식으로, 이를 통해 예측의 안정성을 높였다. 학습 데이터로는 전 세계 168개 도시의 항공 LiDAR 데이터에서 추출한 정규화된 디지털 표면 모델(nDSM)을 정답 레이블(Ground Truth)로 활용했다.\n\n\n추론(Inference) 및 배포 단계에서는 모델 예측의 불확실성(Uncertainty)을 정량화하기 위해 테스트 시간 증강(TTA, Test Time Augmentation) 기법을 도입했다. 대용량 위성 영상을 처리할 때 슬라이딩 윈도우 방식을 적용하여 겹치는 영역에 대해 픽셀당 최대 4번의 예측을 수행하고, 이 결과값들의 분산을 계산하여 데이터의 신뢰도 지표로 삼았다. 이러한 딥러닝 파이프라인은 기존 오픈소스 데이터가 커버하지 못하는 지역의 데이터를 생성하는 데 핵심적인 역할을 했으나, 아프리카 등 학습 데이터(LiDAR)가 전무한 지역에 대해서는 도메인 적응(Domain Adaptation)의 한계가 존재함을 명시하고 있다.\n\n\n기술 연구 및 개발 의미\n이 연구는 단순한 데이터 구축을 넘어 유엔의 지속가능발전목표(SDG) 11번, 특히 토지 소비율과 인구 증가율의 비율을 모니터링하는 데 있어 단순 면적보다 '건물 부피' 기반 지표가 도시의 개발 상태와 인구 밀도를 더 정확하게 반영함을 입증했다. 1인당 건축 부피와 GDP의 상관관계를 분석한 결과, 부피 기반 지표가 경제 발전 수준을 더 잘 설명하는 것으로 나타났다. \n\n\n\n상관관계 분석 결과\n\n이러한 고해상도 3D 데이터의 공개는 도시 계획, 재난 위험 관리, 기후 변화 대응 연구 분야에 즉각적인 활용이 가능하다. 구체적으로는 홍수나 지진 발생 시 피해 규모를 건물의 높이와 부피에 기반해 정확하게 시뮬레이션하거나, 도시의 건물 밀도와 부피를 분석하여 에너지 소비 효율을 계산하고 인구 과밀 지역의 주거 환경을 파악하는 기초 자료로 쓰일 수 있다. 해당 연구의 방법론과 데이터셋 구축 과정에 대한 상세한 내용은 과학 저널인 Earth System Science Data에 게재되어 학술적 검증을 마쳤으며, 연구팀은 이 데이터를 오픈 소스로 공개하여 전 세계 연구자와 정책 입안자들이 자유롭게 활용할 수 있도록 했다.\n\n\n\n마무리\n논문의 주 저자들을 보면 알겠지만, 모두 중국인이다(요즘 놀랍지도 않은...). 논문은 매우 기술적이고, AI 사용 접근 방법은 똑똑하다. 글로벌 연구 분야에서 이런 상황들이 최근 몇 년 사이 크게 많아지고 있다. 이들이 접근한 방법들을 보고 있자면 여러가지 생각이 든다. 사실, 국내 연구 학계(산학연 포함)에서 이렇게 대규모의 데이터셋 수집, 구축, 기술 개발, 성능 분석, 연구 과정의 투명한? 오픈소스 공개, 여러 저자들 간의 협력적 연구를 통한 시너지 효과를 발생하는 경우는 매우 드물다. 좋은 연구 결과를 만든 것은 연구자들의 열정과 노력도 중요하겠지만 연구 핵심기술 개발에 대한 선택과 집중이 가능한 연구 환경이 전제 되어야 한다. 이런 환경의 연구기관 인프라는 참 부럽다는 생각이다.\n\n\n레퍼런스\n\nLiterally a Map Showing All the Buildings in the World\nzhu-xlab/GlobalBuildingAtlas\nESSD - GlobalBuildingAtlas: an open global and complete dataset of building polygons, heights and LoD1 3D models",

AI가 만든 영상은 기술적으로는 완벽할지 모릅니다. 매끄러운 화면 전환, 완벽한 발음의 내레이션, 깔끔한 자막 등 흠잡을 데가 없어 보이죠. 하지만 그 속에는 <b>인간만이 전달할 수 있는 감정, 미묘한 맥락, 그리고 깊이 있는 서사적 여운</b>이 부족합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결국 AI는 &lsquo;기술적으로 완벽한 콘텐츠&rsquo;는 무한정 만들어낼 수 있지만, &lsquo;사람의 마음에 깊이 남는 이야기&rsquo;를 만드는 데는 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 의미에서 사람들을 울리고 웃기며, 생각하게 만드는 콘텐츠는 여전히 인간의 손길, 즉 <b>인간적인 시각과 경험</b>에서 비롯된다고 생각해요. 저는 이 차이가 바로 생성형 AI 시대에 우리가 주목해야 할 가장 중요한 지점이라고 봅니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  4. 알고리즘의 편향 &mdash; 유튜브는 우리를 '확증 편향'에 가둔다</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">유튜브의 AI 추천 시스템은 정말이지 놀랍도록 정교합니다. 사용자가 어떤 영상을 좋아하는지 귀신같이 알아내고, 계속해서 취향에 맞는 영상을 제안해주죠. 하지만 이 친절함 뒤에는 <b>&lsquo;디지털 편향(Digital Bias)&rsquo;</b>이라는 숨겨진 위험이 도사리고 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI는 우리에게 &ldquo;당신이 좋아할 만한 걸 더 보여줄게&rdquo;라고 말하지만, 이건 동시에 <b>&ldquo;당신이 좋아하지 않을 만한 다른 세계는 보여주지 않을게&rdquo;</b>라는 의미가 될 수 있습니다. 즉, 우리가 이미 가지고 있는 생각이나 신념을 강화하는 콘텐츠만을 계속 보여줌으로써 <b>&lsquo;확증 편향(Confirmation Bias)&rsquo;</b>에 갇히게 만드는 것이죠. 결국 우리는 점점 더 비슷한 정보와 관점 속에 머물게 되고, 시야는 좁아질 수밖에 없습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #fce8e6; border-left: 4px solid #d93025; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">⚠️ <b>경고:</b> 알고리즘 편향은 특정 정보에만 노출되게 하여, 잘못된 정보나 극단적인 관점에 쉽게 빠지게 만들 수 있습니다. 다양한 미디어를 통해 균형 잡힌 시각을 갖는 것이 중요합니다.</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">반면 TV는 어땠나요? 과거 지상파 방송들은 <b>의도적으로 다양한 장르와 시사 프로그램을 편성</b>하여 시청자들에게 균형 잡힌 시야를 제공하고자 노력했습니다. 내가 원하든 원치 않든, 뉴스, 다큐멘터리, 교양 프로그램 등을 접하며 자연스럽게 세상의 다양한 면을 알게 되었죠.

        "contentSnippet": "최근 거실 TV는 넷플릭스를 넘어 유튜브가 점령한 듯 보이죠. 뉴스, 예능, 드라마 할 것 없이 모두 유튜브로 소비되는 시, 우리는 정말 TV를 떠나왔을까요? 생성형 AI 시대, 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에서 우리가 놓치고 있는 '인간적인 이야기'의 가치와 유튜브가 TV를 완전히 대체할 수 없는 진짜 이유를 파헤쳐봅니다.\n\n\n  1. 유튜브의 '무한 자유'가 역설적으로 '결정 피로'를 부른다\n유튜브의 가장 큰 매력 중 하나는 바로 ‘선택의 자유’라고 생각해요. 언제든 원하는 영상을 골라볼 수 있고, AI가 사용자의 취향을 분석해서 딱 맞는 콘텐츠를 추천해주죠. 마치 나만을 위한 비서가 있는 것 같은 기분마저 듭니다. 그런데 말이죠, 이 끝없이 펼쳐진 선택지들이 때로는 피로감으로 다가오기도 합니다.\n저만 그런가요? “오늘은 뭘 볼까?” 하며 수십 개의 썸네일을 넘기다가 결국은 아무것도 제대로 보지 못한 채 시간이 흘러버리는 경험, 여러분도 한두 번쯤 있으실 거예요. 이런 현상을 ‘결정 피로(Decision Fatigue)’라고 부르는데요. 무한한 자유가 역설적으로 더 큰 스트레스를 안겨주는 거죠. 보고 싶은 건 많고, 시간은 한정적인데, 내 선택이 과연 최선인지 계속 의심하게 됩니다.\n생각해보면, 예전 TV 시절에는 이런 고민이 훨씬 덜했어요. 방송사에서 정해준 편성표에 맞춰 모두가 같은 시간에 ‘함께’ 드라마를 보고, 예능을 보며 웃었죠. 이런 단순함이 오히려 시청자들에게 ‘시청의 리듬’을 만들어주고, 콘텐츠에 온전히 몰입할 수 있도록 도와줬던 것 같습니다. 요즘처럼 복잡한 세상에선 이런 단순함이 주는 편안함이 가끔 그립기도 해요.\n  팁: 결정 피로를 줄이려면, 시청할 콘텐츠의 장르나 시청 시간을 미리 정해두거나, 정주행할 시리즈를 한두 개만 집중해서 보는 것도 좋은 방법이에요!\n ‍ ‍ ‍  2. TV는 '공동체 경험'을, 유튜브는 '개인의 세계'를 확장한다\nTV는 단순히 콘텐츠를 보여주는 매체 그 이상이었어요. 온 가족이 거실에 모여 같은 예능 프로그램을 보며 웃고 떠들거나, 다음 날 학교나 직장에서 친구, 동료들과 어젯밤 드라마 이야기에 꽃을 피웠던 경험, 다들 있으실 겁니다. 이건 단순한 콘텐츠 소비가 아니라, ‘공유된 문화 경험(Shared Cultural Experience)’이자 ‘공동체의 연결고리’였죠.\n하지만 유튜브는 그 방식이 완전히 다릅니다. 각자의 스마트폰이나 태블릿 앞에서 각자의 알고리즘이 추천하는 영상들을 보고 있어요. 어떤 사람은 인기 브이로그를, 다른 사람은 심층적인 정치 분석 영상을, 또 어떤 사람은 한창 빠져있는 게임 방송을 보고 있을 겁니다. 결국 유튜브는 공동체의 연결 대신, 개개인의 세계를 심도 있게 확장시켜주는 역할을 합니다.\n물론 개인의 취향을 깊이 파고들 수 있다는 장점은 분명하지만, 문제는 이제 “같은 것을 본 사람”을 찾기가 점점 어려워진다는 점이에요. 과거에는 “어제 그 드라마 봤어?” 한마디로 대화가 시작되었지만, 이제는 각자의 알고리즘이 만든 세상 속에서 서로 다른 경험을 쌓아가고 있습니다. 이렇게 단절된 경험은 소통의 폭을 좁히고, 때로는 고립감을 느끼게 할 수도 있어요.\n\n\n  3. 생성형 AI 시대, 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에 '의미'가 사라진다\n현재 2025년, 생성형 AI(Generative AI)는 유튜브 콘텐츠 제작 방식을 급진적으로 변화시키고 있습니다. 이제 AI는 영상 편집, 자막 생성, 심지어 내레이션까지 자동으로 처리해주고, 더 나아가서는 AI가 직접 영상을 기획하고 제작하는 수준에 이르렀죠. 덕분에 콘텐츠의 양(量)은 폭발적으로 증가했지만, 그 이면에는 우려스러운 그림자가 드리워져 있습니다.\n바로 콘텐츠가 가진 ‘질(質)’과 ‘진정성’이 점점 옅어지고 있다는 점입니다. AI가 만든 영상은 기술적으로는 완벽할지 모릅니다. 매끄러운 화면 전환, 완벽한 발음의 내레이션, 깔끔한 자막 등 흠잡을 데가 없어 보이죠. 하지만 그 속에는 인간만이 전달할 수 있는 감정, 미묘한 맥락, 그리고 깊이 있는 서사적 여운이 부족합니다.\n결국 AI는 ‘기술적으로 완벽한 콘텐츠’는 무한정 만들어낼 수 있지만, ‘사람의 마음에 깊이 남는 이야기’를 만드는 데는 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 의미에서 사람들을 울리고 웃기며, 생각하게 만드는 콘텐츠는 여전히 인간의 손길, 즉 인간적인 시각과 경험에서 비롯된다고 생각해요. 저는 이 차이가 바로 생성형 AI 시대에 우리가 주목해야 할 가장 중요한 지점이라고 봅니다.\n  4. 알고리즘의 편향 — 유튜브는 우리를 '확증 편향'에 가둔다\n유튜브의 AI 추천 시스템은 정말이지 놀랍도록 정교합니다. 사용자가 어떤 영상을 좋아하는지 귀신같이 알아내고, 계속해서 취향에 맞는 영상을 제안해주죠. 하지만 이 친절함 뒤에는 ‘디지털 편향(Digital Bias)’이라는 숨겨진 위험이 도사리고 있습니다.\nAI는 우리에게 “당신이 좋아할 만한 걸 더 보여줄게”라고 말하지만, 이건 동시에 “당신이 좋아하지 않을 만한 다른 세계는 보여주지 않을게”라는 의미가 될 수 있습니다. 즉, 우리가 이미 가지고 있는 생각이나 신념을 강화하는 콘텐츠만을 계속 보여줌으로써 ‘확증 편향(Confirmation Bias)’에 갇히게 만드는 것이죠. 결국 우리는 점점 더 비슷한 정보와 관점 속에 머물게 되고, 시야는 좁아질 수밖에 없습니다.\n⚠️ 경고: 알고리즘 편향은 특정 정보에만 노출되게 하여, 잘못된 정보나 극단적인 관점에 쉽게 빠지게 만들 수 있습니다. 다양한 미디어를 통해 균형 잡힌 시각을 갖는 것이 중요합니다.\n반면 TV는 어땠나요? 과거 지상파 방송들은 의도적으로 다양한 장르와 시사 프로그램을 편성하여 시청자들에게 균형 잡힌 시야를 제공하고자 노력했습니다. 내가 원하든 원치 않든, 뉴스, 다큐멘터리, 교양 프로그램 등을 접하며 자연스럽게 세상의 다양한 면을 알게 되었죠. AI는 아직 이런 ‘균형의 감각’을 완전히 대체하지 못하는 것 같습니다. 이 점이 TV가 가진 공익적 역할의 중요한 부분이라고 생각해요.\n\n\n ️ 5. TV는 여전히 '공공의 미디어'로서 그 역할을 다한다\n유튜브가 주로 광고 수익을 기반으로 한 상업적 플랫폼이라면, TV는 여전히 ‘공공적 미디어’로서의 중요한 가치를 지닙니다. 비상 상황에서 재난 속보를 실시간으로 전달하고, 중요한 선거 개표 방송을 통해 민주주의 과정을 중계하며, 사회적 이슈에 대한 심층 보도를 통해 공론의 장을 형성하는 역할은 2025년 현재에도 TV가 가장 강력하게 수행하는 기능입니다.\n물론 유튜브를 통해서도 속보나 사회적 이슈를 접할 수 있지만, 파편화된 정보와 개인화된 추천 알고리즘 속에서는 공신력 있는 정보를 신속하고 일관성 있게 전달하는 데 한계가 있을 수밖에 없어요. 특히 국가적 재난이나 중대한 사회적 의제에 대해서는 모든 국민이 같은 정보를 동시에 접하고 함께 대응하는 것이 중요합니다. 이점에서 TV는 여전히 대체 불가능한 역할을 담당하고 있습니다.\n그러므로 유튜브가 아무리 성장하고 개인화된 콘텐츠 소비를 주도하더라도, ‘공익적 미디어’로서의 TV의 자리는 쉽게 사라지지 않을 겁니다. 오히려 급변하는 미디어 환경 속에서 그 중요성은 더욱 부각될 수도 있다고 생각해요. 다양한 관점과 균형 잡힌 정보 전달이라는 기본적인 책무는 상업적 이윤 추구만으로는 완벽히 채워질 수 없으니까요.\n  6. 생성형 AI 시대, '인간적인 콘텐츠'가 진정한 경쟁력이 된다\n미래에는 AI가 영상 콘텐츠의 90% 이상을 만들어낼지도 모른다는 예측도 나오고 있습니다. 정말 놀라운 기술의 발전이죠. 하지만 저는 사람들이 여전히 ‘사람이 직접 만든 콘텐츠’를 더욱 신뢰하고 가치를 둔다고 봅니다. 왜냐하면 우리는 기계의 완벽한 논리보다는, 인간의 진솔한 감정과 경험에 더 깊이 반응하기 때문이에요.\n앞으로의 미디어 경쟁은 단순히 “누가 더 기술적으로 잘 만드는가?”를 넘어, “누가 더 인간적으로, 진정성 있게 이야기하는가?”에 달려 있을 것이라고 확신합니다. AI는 완벽한 형식을 구현할 수 있지만, 그 속에 담긴 의미와 감동, 그리고 사람 사이의 공감대를 형성하는 능력은 여전히 인간의 고유한 영역으로 남아있을 겁니다.\n결국 AI는 효율성을 제공하고 콘텐츠의 양을 폭발적으로 늘리겠지만, 진정한 울림을 주는 '이야기꾼'은 여전히 인간이라는 사실을 명심해야 합니다. 이 근본적인 차이가 바로 유튜브가 TV를 완전히 대체할 수 없는 가장 중요한 이유이며, 다가올 AI 시대의 콘텐츠 전략에서 우리가 반드시 놓치지 말아야 할 핵심 가치라고 생각해요.\n✅ 결론: 유튜브는 TV의 '끝'이 아닌, 또 다른 '진화'다\n유튜브가 TV를 완전히 대체했다는 말은, 어쩌면 성급한 판단일지도 모릅니다. 저는 유튜브가 TV의 기능을 완전히 소멸시킨 것이 아니라, TV가 해오던 많은 역할을 새로운 디지털 환경에 맞춰 진화시킨 플랫폼이라고 생각해요.\n유튜브는 개인화된 미디어로서 사용자의 취향을 깊이 파고들지만, TV는 여전히 공공적이고 공동체적인 미디어로서 사회적 역할을 다하고 있습니다. 그리고 2025년 현재, 생성형 AI의 등장으로 이 둘의 경계는 더욱 흐려지고 있죠.\n하지만 분명한 건 하나입니다. 다가올 AI 시대의 미디어 경쟁은 단순한 기술의 싸움이 아니라, ‘인간성의 복원력 싸움’이라는 점입니다. 기계는 아무리 정교하고 완벽한 영상을 만들어낼 수 있어도, 그 안에 담긴 이야기를 진심으로 ‘전달’하고 사람의 마음을 움직이는 것은 여전히 인간의 고유한 영역으로 남아있습니다.\n결국, 유튜브와 TV는 서로 다른 방식으로 우리의 삶에 스며들어 있을 뿐, 각자의 가치와 역할을 가지고 공존하며 미디어의 미래를 만들어갈 것이라고 믿습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✔️ 유튜브의 무한한 선택권은 '결정 피로'를 유발하며, 단순했던 TV 시절의 시청 리듬을 그립게 만듭니다.\n✔️ 생성형 AI는 콘텐츠 양을 늘리지만, '인간적 진정성'을 희석시켜 기술적 완벽함과 감동 사이의 간극을 만듭니다.\n✔️ TV는 여전히 '공동체적 경험'과 '공공의 미디어'로서의 책임을 다하며 대체 불가능한 역할을 수행합니다.\n✔️ 미래 미디어의 진정한 경쟁력은 '기술'이 아닌 '인간력', 즉 감동을 주는 인간적인 이야기에 달려 있습니다.\n미디어 환경의 변화 속에서도, 결국 사람의 마음을 움직이는 것은 기술이 아닌 '사람의 이야기'라는 점을 잊지 말아야 합니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1. 유튜브가 TV를 완전히 대체하지 못하는 가장 큰 이유는 무엇인가요?\n가장 큰 이유는 TV가 제공하는 '공동체적 시청 경험'과 '공공 미디어로서의 역할'을 유튜브가 완벽히 대체하기 어렵기 때문입니다. 유튜브는 개인화에 강하지만, 재난 속보나 사회적 이슈의 공론장 역할, 그리고 같은 시대를 공유하는 문화적 경험 제공에는 TV가 여전히 더 강력합니다.\nQ2. 생성형 AI가 콘텐츠 제작에 미치는 긍정적 영향과 부정적 영향은 무엇인가요?\n긍정적인 영향으로는 콘텐츠 제작의 효율성 증대 및 양적 폭발적인 증가를 들 수 있습니다. 하지만 부정적인 영향으로는 '인간적인 진정성'과 '깊이 있는 서사'의 부재로 인해 기술적으로 완벽하지만 감동 없는 콘텐츠가 양산될 수 있다는 점입니다.\nQ3. '결정 피로'란 무엇이며, 유튜브 시청 시 어떻게 나타날 수 있나요?\n'결정 피로'는 너무 많은 선택지 앞에서 결정을 내리는 데 지쳐 심리적으로 피로감을 느끼는 현상입니다. 유튜브에서는 수많은 영상 썸네일과 끊임없는 추천 목록 앞에서 무엇을 볼지 계속 고민하다가 결국 아무것도 보지 못하거나 만족도가 떨어지는 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"유튜브가 TV를 완전히 대체하지 못하는 가장 큰 이유는 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"가장 큰 이유는 TV가 제공하는 '공동체적 시청 경험'과 '공공 미디어로서의 역할'을 유튜브가 완벽히 대체하기 어렵기 때문입니다. 유튜브는 개인화에 강하지만, 재난 속보나 사회적 이슈의 공론장 역할, 그리고 같은 시대를 공유하는 문화적 경험 제공에는 TV가 여전히 더 강력합니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"생성형 AI가 콘텐츠 제작에 미치는 긍정적 영향과 부정적 영향은 무엇인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"긍정적인 영향으로는 콘텐츠 제작의 효율성 증대 및 양적 폭발적인 증가를 들 수 있습니다. 하지만 부정적인 영향으로는 '인간적인 진정성'과 '깊이 있는 서사'의 부재로 인해 기술적으로 완벽하지만 감동 없는 콘텐츠가 양산될 수 있다는 점입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"'결정 피로'란 무엇이며, 유튜브 시청 시 어떻게 나타날 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"'결정 피로'는 너무 많은 선택지 앞에서 결정을 내리는 데 지쳐 심리적으로 피로감을 느끼는 현상입니다. 유튜브에서는 수많은 영상 썸네일과 끊임없는 추천 목록 앞에서 무엇을 볼지 계속 고민하다가 결국 아무것도 보지 못하거나 만족도가 떨어지는 결과를 초래할 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "내가 2012년에 스트롱의 첫 번째 펀드를 만들 때는 VC 사업에 대해서 정말 아무것도 몰랐다. 어떻게 돈을 모으고, 어떤 방식으로 펀드가 작동하는지, 그리고 남에게 받은 돈을 어떻게 운영해야 하는지 감이 전혀 없었다. 그냥 딱 한 가지 자신 있었던 건, 남들이 잘 못 알아보고, 잘 안 알아보는 똑똑한 창업가를 그 누구보다 먼저 알아보고 이들에게 투자할 수 있는 능력이었다. 하지만, 이렇게 똑똑한 사람을 알아보고 투자하기 위해서는 기본적으로 돈이 필요했는데, 그땐 나에게 없었던 게 바로 돈이었다.\n누구한테 돈을 달라고 해야 할지도 몰랐다. 일단 큰 기관 투자자들은 우리같이 처음 펀드를 만드는 초짜 VC에겐 돈을 안 주고, 돈이 많은 개인들이 확률이 좀 높긴 했는데, 솔직히 내 주변에 이런 사람들도 없었다. 그래도 그냥 여기저기 기웃거리면서 돈 좀 있는 분들을 한 명씩 소개 받았다. 한 명이 거절을 하면, 이분에게 또 한 명을 소개받고, 그 사람이 거절하면 그 분에게 또 한 명을 소개받고,,,이렇게 하면서 한 명씩 꾸역꾸역 지루한 미팅을 계속했다.\n2014년도에 강북구 수유리 쪽에서 주유소를 여러 개 운영하는 현금이 많은 나이 든 분을 만난 적이 있다. 본인 입으로 현금이 10억 원 있다고 자랑했으니, 당시로는 현금이 많은 분이었다.\n이 분과의 대화는 예상외로 잘 진행됐다. “스트롱벤처스는 뭘 보고 주로 투자하나요?”라는 질문이 나오기까진. 나는 우리는 절대적으로 사람을 보고 투자하고, 시장, 제품, 수치 모두 다 중요하지만 결국엔 사람을 보고 투자한다고 했는데, 갑자기 이분이 화를 엄청나게 내면서, 그렇게 안 봤는데 젊은 사람이 왜 이렇게 어리석냐, 세상에서 가장 믿으면 안 되는 게 사람인데 사람을 보고 투자하는 그런 멍청한 투자자가 어디 있냐면서 결국 내가 꽤 공을 들였던 그 미팅은 거기서 끝났다.\n그날 밤, 우리의 사람에 투자하는 전략이 혹시 잘못된 건지 살짝 고민도 해봤지만, 결국엔 이게 우리가 가야 하는 방향이었고, 우린 13년 동안 이 기본 원칙을 더욱더 확고히 다듬었다. 그리고 지금 생각해 보면, 당시 그 주유소 사장님은 본인 사업의 공식에서 사람을 제외했기 때문에 현금을 10억 원밖에 못 번 것 같다.\n우리가 사는 이 세상은 요새 눈 돌아가고 토 나올 정도로 빠르게 변하고 있다. 내가 일하고 있는 이 분야는 AI 때문에 온 세상이 파괴되고 있다. 이 외의 온갖 기술이 새로 나오고 발전하고 있고, 이에 따라 새로운 사업이 매일 만들어지고 있다. 환율은 미친 듯이 올라갔다가 내려가고, 주식 시장은 거품이 터질 듯 말 듯 하면서 계속 활활 불타고 있다. 법과 규제 또한 이런 변화에 발맞춰서 계속 변하고 있다. 즉, 우리가 예측할 수 있는 건 아무것도 없다. 아무리 많이 분석하고, 연구하고, 조사하고, 공부해도 절대로 시장을 예측할 수 없고, 투자한 회사도 어떻게 될지 예측할 수 없다. 누가 말했는지 기억은 안 나지만, 유일하게 변하지 않는 건 변화 그 자체이다.\n하지만, 변하지 않는 게 여기 또 하나 있는데, 그게 바로 사람이다. 나는 사람은 변하지 않는다고 믿는다. 사업을 하다 보면 수많은 변수가 있고, 모든 게 변하지만, 그 사업을 시작한 사람은 잘 안 변하기 때문에 어떻게 보면 사업에 있어서 가장 리스크가 적은 게 바로 창업가이다. 그래서 우리는 13년 전에도 그랬지만, 지금도 사람한테 투자하고 있다. 모든 게 정신없이 변하는 지금 이때, 이럴 때일수록 우리는 사람을 보고 투자해야 한다고 믿는다.\n이런 전략 때문에 우리는 사업에 실패했지만, 그 실패한 사업을 하는 동안 창업가와의 경험이 좋았다면, 같은 사람에게 또 투자할 수 있다. 사업의 성공과 실패는 운이 크게 작용하고, 창업가가 컨트롤할 수 없는 여러 가지 변수가 있지만, 그 사람은 안 바뀌기 때문이다. 하지만, 사업에는 성공했지만 그 사람과의 경험이 좋지 않았다면, 같은 창업가가 새로운 사업을 시작해도 절대로 다시 투자하지 않는다. 똑같은 이유인데, 사람의 기본적인 성향은 절대로 안 바뀌기 때문이다.\n어떻게 보면 우리 같은 VC는 ‘사람’이라는 아주 독특하고 어디로 튈지 모르는 자산에 투자하고 있는데, 너무 많은 VC가 위의 주유소 사장님과 같이 사람만 빼고 다른 모든 것에 투자하고 있다. 말은 모두 다 사람에 투자한다고 하지만, 내가 봤을 때 사람에 투자하는 VC가 점점 유니콘만큼 찾기가 힘들어지고 있는 게 현실이다.\n물론, 사람이 항상 좋은 건 아니다. 이상한 사람은 항상 이상하고, 개새끼는 항상 개새끼다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 글을 읽는 다른 VC가 있다면, 아마도 나와 비슷할 것인데, 다음과 같은 창업가들을 분명 만나본 적이 있을 것이다. 내가 열린 마음으로 사람들을 만나는 직업을 갖고 있지만, 아무리 만나도 호감이 안 가고, 만나면 만날수록 더 싫어지는 종류의 창업가들이 있다. 실은 이런 분들이 여러 종류가 있지만, 요새 내가 정말 피하고 싶은, 만나면 하루가 다 피곤해지는 분들이 바로 변명하는 창업가들이다.\n이들의 공통점이 몇 가지 있다. 일단 사업은 더럽게 못 한다. 제품도 잘 못 만들고, 영업과 마케팅도 잘 못 한다. 그리고 이러다 보니 펀드레이징도 잘 못한다. 뭐, 실은 대부분의 스타트업이 이렇긴 하다. 대부분 제품 잘 못 만들고, 잘 못 팔고, 투자 잘 못 받는다. 하지만, 변명하는 분들의 공통점은 이렇게 사업이 잘 안되는 이유를 항상 밖에서 찾는다는 점이다. 항상 경쟁사를 탓하고 비방하고, 투자를 못 받는 이유는 투자자들이 멍청해서 사업을 잘 이해하지 못하기 때문이다. 그리고 다른 비슷한 회사가 투자받으면, 우리 회사가 저 회사보다 기술력도 좋고, 내가 저 대표보다 훨씬 더 똑똑하고 능력 있는데, 왜 저 회사는 투자받고 우리는 못 받는지에 대해 너무 오랫동안 자존심 상해하고, 그 이유를 밖에서 찾는데 너무 많은 시간과 에너지를 낭비한다.\n이렇게 모든 이유를 외부에서 찾고, 변명하는 분들의 또 다른 공통점은 “무엇(what)”에 대해서 고민해야 하는 시간에 “왜(why)”에 대해서 너무 많이 고민한다는 것이다.\n다른 회사가 우리 회사보다 더 많은 고객을 확보했고, 이들로부터 더 많은 매출을 만들고 있다면, 우리가 훨씬 더 좋은 제품을 만들고 있는데 왜 다른 회사 매출이 더 높은지에 대해서 생각하지 말고, 우리는 무엇을 하면 더 많은 고객을 유치하고 매출을 만들 수 있을지 고민해야 한다.\n우리는 1년 동안 100명의 투자자를 만났음에도 전부 다 거절당했는데, 우리보다 월등히 기술력도 떨어지고, 사기꾼 대표가 운영하는 다른 경쟁사는 수백억 원 투자받았다면, 왜 우리보다 안 좋은 회사는 투자받았지, 고민하면서 스트레스받지 말고, 우리는 지금 당장 뭘 하고, 뭘 고치면 투자받을 수 있을지 고민해 보는 걸 권장한다.\n물론, 무엇을 할지 결정하기 위해서는, 왜에 동반되는 이유를 알아야 한다. 하지만, 내가 여기서 강조하고자 하는 건, “왜”에 너무 집착하다 보면 나는 전혀 문제가 없고, 나는 너무 잘났는데 다른 사람들이 멍청해서 나를 못 알아본다는 남 탓하는 악성 관점에 빠지기 쉽다는 점이다. “무엇”에 집착하면 내가 문제가 있기 때문에 뭔가를 고쳐야 한다는 자신을 탓하는 시각을 갖게 되는데, 정말로 좋아지고 싶다면, why가 아니라 what에 집중해야 한다.\n지금, 이 순간에도 남을 탓하고 있는 창업가들은 “왜”보단 “무엇”에 입각한 고민과 반성을 하기 바란다. 설령, 나는 잘났는데 남들이 멍청하고 못나서 나를 못 알아봐도 그게 현실이니까 남을 바꾸려 하지 말고 자신을 바꾸려 노력해 봐라.\n근데 현실은, 내가 멍청하고, 내가 못났고, 내가 이상하니까 일이 안 풀리는 것이다. 세상은 그렇게 만만치 않다.",

타인의 마음을 헤아리기 위해 썼던 에너지를 온전히 나에게 돌려보는 것, 이게 과연 가능한 일일까? 애초에 ‘자기 자신’은 가장 번역하기 까다로운 텍스트다. 온갖 편견과 감정이 필터로 작용해 원문을 깨끗한 상태로 보기 어렵기 때문이다.\n나에게 다정해지는 것이 이토록 어려운 이유는 무엇일까. 어쩌면 우리 세상이 결함 찾기와 채찍질을 성장의 동력으로 삼는 거대한 시스템이기 때문일지 모른다. 우리는 약한 소리가 패배자의 넋두리로 치부되고 과정보다 결과로 모든 것이 평가받는 문화 속에서 자라왔다. 내 안의 비판자는 바로 그 시스템이 내면화된 유능한 감독관이다. 그는 ‘이만하면 됐어’라는 안도감을 사치로 여기고 ‘아직 멀었어’라는 채찍질을 성장의 동의어로 삼는다. 실제로 그의 혹독함은 종종 가시적인 성과를 낳기에 우리는 그를 떼어내야 할 악덕이 아니라 필요한 동력이라고 착각한다. 그는 효율이라는 잣대로 감정적 군더더기를 잘라내면서 목표 달성을 위해서 감정은 불필요한 비용이라고 외친다. 그 결과 우리는 감정을 느끼고 표현하는 법 대신 그것을 분석하고 통제하는 법을 먼저 배운다. 하지만 억눌린 감정은 사라지지 않고 마음속에 보이지 않는 부채로 쌓여간다. 효율만이 삶의 유일한 척도가 될 수는 없다. 기계가 아닌 이상 인간은 감정이라는 윤활유 없이 온전히 굴러갈 수 없다. 그러니 언제까지 이 냉혹한 감독관에게 내 삶의 편집권을 모두 맡겨둘 수는 없는 노릇이다.\n내 안의 비판자는 사실 형편없는 번역가다. 그는 늘 최악의 단어만을 선택해 상황을 극적으로 왜곡한다. 가령, 마감에 쫓겨 쓴 문장 하나가 마음에 들지 않을 때 그는 ‘이 문장은 다음번에 더 잘 다듬어보자’라고 번역하는 대신 ‘거봐, 넌 재능이 없어’라고 매몰차게 힐난한다. 작은 실수 하나를 내 전체의 결함으로 확대 해석하는 치명적인 오역을 상습적으로 저지른다. 타인에게 받은 칭찬마저도 ‘상대가 예의상 한 말’이라거나 ‘네 어설픈 실력을 제대로 몰라서 하는 소리’라고 왜곡해 번역한다. 또한 새로운 제안 앞에서 느끼는 두려움은 ‘넌 해낼 능력이 없다’는 확신으로 둔갑시키고 일이 순조롭게 풀릴 때의 안도감마저 ‘곧 닥쳐올 위기의 전조’라고 번역해 버린다. 그리고 휴식의 필요성을 느끼는 몸의 신호마저 ‘의지박약의 증거’로 번역한다. 이런 편향된 번역에 길들여진 나는 나를 있는 그대로 보지 못하고 늘 부족하고 문제 많은 존재로 인식하고 만다. 마치 왜곡된 자막으로 영화를 보는 것처럼.\n늘 고민이다. 이 악순환을 끊고 나를 위한 정역을 시작할 순 없을까. 번역가로 오래 살아온 나는 사실 방법을 알고 있다. 거창한 결심이 아니라 아주 작은 언어 습관이면 첫걸음은 뗄 수 있다. 내 안의 비판자가 뱉는 1차 번역을 의심하고 곧바로 2차 번역을 시도하는 거다. 예를 들어, 야심 차게 세운 계획이 틀어졌을 때 ‘역시 난 안 돼’라는 1차 번역문이 올라오면 의식적으로 ‘괜찮은 시도였어’라고 번역문을 고친다. 감정의 근력 운동과 비슷하다. 수십 년간 한쪽으로만 발달한 비판의 근육 대신 너그러움과 수용의 근육을 키우는 훈련. 물론 이 시도는 번번이 실패하기 일쑤다. 평생 써보지 않은 근육을 움직이려는 것처럼 삐걱대고 자신에게 건네는 다정한 말이 오글거려 닭살이 돋는다. 매번 어색하고 민망하다. 하지만 가혹한 비판자가 사는 내 안의 살풍경을 바꾸고자 한다면 이 민망한 시도를 의식적으로 반복해야 한다는 걸 너무나도 잘 안다.\n이 고된 훈련이 결국 가져다주리라 믿는 선물은 지속 가능한 삶이다. 끊임없는 자기 비난은 영혼을 서서히 좀먹는다. 아무리 좋은 성과를 내도 내면의 칭찬에 인색하니 기쁨은 짧고 자책은 길다. 이런 상태로는 오래 달릴 수가 없다. 새로운 도전을 앞둔 사람에게 자기 비난은 족쇄와 같다. ‘해봤자 안 될 거야’라는 내면의 목소리는 시작하려는 용기를 꺾고, 완벽한 결과에 대한 강박은 첫걸음도 떼지 못하게 발목을 잡는다. 결국 아무것도 시도하지 못한 채 시간만 보내는 무력한 상태는 능력 부족이 아니라 자기 비난의 과잉이 만들어낸 결과물일 때가 많다. 어쩌면 나에 대한 다정함은 사치가 아니라 생존 기술에 가까운 것일지도 모른다. 아무도, 심지어 가족도 나를 지지하지 않을 땐 나라도 나를 다독여야 최소한의 동력을 얻는다. 나는 내 최후의 보루다. 영어 ‘last resort’는 최후의 보루, 최후의 수단을 뜻한다. 여기서 ‘resort’는 ‘방책’이 아니라 ‘의지할 곳’, ‘쉴 곳’을 뜻한다. 내 최후의 보루가 나라고 한다면 이 영어 표현처럼 내 최후의 안식처이자 내 최후의 쉴 곳은 바로 나다. 세상 그 누가 날 지지하지 않아도 나만은 나를 다독이고 위로해야 한다.\n가끔은 이런 생각도 든다. 나를 향해 다정해지려는 이 서툰 시도가 혹시 타인을 향한 시선까지 바꿔놓는 것은 아닐까. 나에게 한 치의 빈틈도 허용하지 않으려 했던 내가, 타인의 작은 허점에도 그토록 날을 세웠던 것은 과연 우연이었을까. 타인을 향한 날 선 비판은 사실 내 안의 비판자에게 ‘난 저 사람보다 낫다’고 항변하기 위한 서글픈 자기방어였을지도 모르겠다. 수많은 현자가 말했듯이 역시 자신과의 관계가 모든 관계의 시작점이다.\n나는 오늘도 책상에 앉아 타인의 말을 번역하고, 동시에 내면의 말을 번역한다. 그리고 아직은 입에 잘 붙지 않는, 나를 향한 다정한 문장들을 가끔 의식적으로 소리 내어 되뇐다. 타인의 문장을 다듬는 섬세함의 절반만이라도 나를 향한 문장에 쓸 수 있기를 바라면서. 우리 인생에서 가장 중요한 번역은 이런 문장들을, 나를 향한 다정함을 마음속에 온전히 새기는 일일지도 모르겠다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}Edit 주소은 Graphic 김목요\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✱커버 그래픽: 여러 사람들 사이에서 나 자신을 먼저 들여다보는 인물을 통해 ‘스스로에게 다정함’이라는 주제를 담아냈습니다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n🔗 〈2025 토스픽〉 공유 이벤트\n\n소중한 사람에게 이 글을 공유해 보세요. \n⓵ 공유 버튼을 눌러 복사된 링크를 메신저, 블로그, SNS 등 원하는 채널로 공유하고, \n⓶ 공유한 화면을 캡처해 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스피드 인스타그램(@toss_feed) DM으로 보내면 참여 완료. \n매월 일상에 즐거움을 더해주는 선물을 준비했어요.  \n✱자세한 이벤트 선물과 참여 안내는 여기(링크)를 참고하세요.",

AI가 써주는 매끄러운 글은 내 사유의 근육을 조금도 키워주지 않는다. 자기 느낌과 생각에 꼭 맞는 표현과 문장을 찾으려고 낑낑대는 동안 쓰기 전에 몰랐던 깨달음을 얻고 내가 누구인지 설명할 수 있는 자기 언어가 만들어진다. 사람과 사람이 어울리며 만들어내는 파도 같은 감정들, 매번 다른 풍경을 보여주는 우연들은 ‘타인의 바다’에 뛰어드는 삶에서만 얻어지는 원초적 즐거움이다. 대면이라는 위험한 놀이에 자신을 빠뜨리지 않으면 상처 받을 일도 없지만 아무 일도 생기지 않으므로 종국엔 고립이라는 상처를 스스로 입히게 될지도 모른다. ‘세 줄 요약’으로 세상만사를 파악하는 시대에 맞서 일단 같이 만나서 두꺼운 책을 읽고 긴 글을 쓰는 일을 오래 지속하는 이유다.\n신세를 져야 관계가 이어진다\n프리랜서로 일하다 보면 동료의 얼굴이 계속 바뀐다. 나의 스승이자 친구인 학인들, 단행본 출간 작업을 같이하는 편집자는 그래도 몇 번의 계절을 함께 보낸다. 반면에 학교나 도서관에서 강연을 하느라 일정을 조율하는 사서, 교사 등은 일회성 관계에 그친다. 실수를 해도 만회할 기회가 없으니까 최대한 말을 아끼고 예의를 다하느라 가까워지기 어려운데, 한번은 사서 샘과 한나절 짜리 풋풋한 우정을 나눴다.\n강연 전날 메일이 왔다. KTX역에서 도서관까지 픽업을 원하면 나갈 테니 편히 말해달라고 한다. 이럴 때 천년의 고민에 휩싸인다. 입 다물고 있어도 되는 택시를 탈 것인가(강연할 에너지를 비축하자), 사회적 자아를 내세워 어색한 대화를 나눌 것인가(강연 전에 진이 빠지면 어쩌지). 지도어플을 켜고 검색하니 25분 소요에 택시비가 34,000원. 지역의 경우 배차 간격이 넓고 빙빙 도는 버스는 선택지에 없다. 왕복 교통비 7만 원이라니, 침묵을 사는 대가 치고는 너무 비쌌다. 망설이다가 답장을 썼다. ‘와주시면 감사하겠습니다.’\n기차역 주차장에서 접선하고 드디어 탑승. 조심스럽게 조수석에 앉아 차 문을 닫고 5초쯤 지났을까, 나도 모르게 첫마디를 뱉었다. “어머, 넬이네요?” 의자에선 ‘엉뜨’ 열선이 온기를 뿜어대고 스피커에선 모던락 밴드 넬의 ‘현실의 현실’이 흘러나오고 있었다. 그간 넬의 공연을 다녀오면 인스타그램에 올리곤 했는데 아무래도 사서샘이 그걸 보고 준비한 모양이다. 몸의 세포들이 노곤해지며 마음의 빗장이 스르르 풀어졌다. “넬은 이름만 알았지 음악은 오면서 처음 들었는데 좋더라고요.” 다정한 사서샘이 만산홍엽으로 물든 가을 풍경을 가르며 말했다.\n영화 〈비포 선라이즈〉에서 주인공 제시와 셀린이 기차에서 우연히 만나 책을 통해 이야기를 나누다가 충동적으로 비엔나에서 같이 내리는 것처럼, 우리는 나란히 도서관 옆 분식점에 왔다. 나는 혼밥으로 강연을 준비하려던 계획을 틀어서 사서 샘에게 “점심 드셔야 되면 같이 드실래요?”라고 말을 걸었다. 키오스크 앞에서 살 안 찌는 키토김밥 두 줄과 메밀국수 하나를 나눠 먹는 것으로 메뉴를 합의하고 결제 단계로 넘긴 다음, 식당 입구에 들어오면서부터 신용카드를 손에 쥐고 있는 사서샘을 어깨로 막아서며 “택시비를 아꼈으니 내가 사겠다”고 우겨서 밥값 20,500원을 계산했다.\n나는 삼십 대에 자유기고가로 일하며 인터뷰를 주로 했다. 취재원과 카페에서 만나 음료를 시킬 때 인터뷰이가 계산한 적이 있었다. 내가 “취재비가 나온다”며 만류해도 “여기까지 오셨으니 제가 사겠다”며 극구 돈을 냈다. 그런 경험이 두 번 있었고, 두 명 다 나이 든 여성 배우였다. 그때마다 속으로 ‘언니 멋지다’며 감동했다. 나도 인터뷰어 경력이 쌓이고 어딜 가면 대접받는 일이 많아지면서 그분들이 가끔 떠올랐다. 언니들이 내게 남긴 교훈은 나이 들어 지갑을 열자가 아니라 ‘당연한 걸 당연하게 여기지 말자’에 가깝다. 어느새 받은 것을 젊은 동료에게 되돌려줘야 하는 언니 자리에 내가 있다.\n밥 대신 계란 지단을 채썰어 넣은 탓에 목이 메고 하나 넣으면 볼이 미어져서 얼굴이 못생겨지는 키토김밥을 우적우적 먹으며 사서샘과 나는 수다를 이어갔다. 목소리가 커지지 않고 끊기지도 않는 내향인들의 잔잔한 대화. 사서샘은 잔나비 팬이었고 락페스티벌이 힘들까봐 안 가봤는데 가보고 싶다고 했고, 나는 락페는 무대를 보다가 돗자리존에서 쉴 수도 있어서 하나도 안 힘들다며 락페 즐기기 팁을 전수했다. 커피는 제가 사겠다는 사서샘을 따라 로스터리 카페로 이동해 커피 테이크아웃까지 야무지게 완료했다. 어쩐지 들뜬 마음으로 평소보다 신나게 강연을 마치고, 주차장으로 나오니 황금빛 낙엽이 바람을 타고 화르륵 화르륵 황홀하게 날렸다.\n“내년 펜타 락페스티벌에 넬이랑 잔나비랑 같이 나왔으면 좋겠네요.”\n“저 잔나비 안 나와도 내년엔 꼭 가볼래요.”\n“저도 올해 못 가서 내년엔 갈 거예요. 락페에 오시면 연락주세요.”\n약 70,000원어치 ‘침묵’을 사는 대신 택한 ‘낯선 만남’은 이렇게 마무리되었다. 아주 가끔이지만 내 얼굴을 보자마자 자신과 자녀의 글쓰기에 관한 궁금증을 쏟아내는 분들도 있다. 성심껏 답해드릴수록 질문 공세가 이어지면 ‘저는 글쓰기 자판기가 아닙니다’라며 속말을 삼킨다. 대단한 악의가 없이 한 사람을 고정된 대상으로 보는 ‘도구적 관계’에 우린 생각보다 익숙하다. 정보는 넘쳐나도 사람과 사람 사이에 전해오는 경험과 지혜의 회로가 끊겨버려서 타인의 기분을 읽어내는 능력이 감퇴하고 있는 것이다.\n이번엔 책 얘기만큼 도파민이 팡팡 터지는 음악 얘기를 원 없이 나눴더니 하나도 피곤하지가 않았다. 내릴 때 손에 쥐여준 선물을 열차에서 펴보고 또 감동했다. 사서샘들이 직접 만든 것으로, 나의 책 열세 권을 초콜릿 미니어처북 모양으로 일일이 만든 수공예품이 가지런히 상자에 담겨 있었다. 세상에 하나뿐인 선물과 선물 같은 시간이 마냥 꿈 같았다. 사서샘에게 감사하고 나에게도 칭찬했다. 신세 지길 참 잘했어! 신세를 져야 관계가 이어진다. 사람을 만날 때 부과되는 정서 노동을 귀찮아도 말고 두려워도 하지 말고, 일을 해치우듯이 하기보다 정성을 쌓자고 다짐했다. 〈비포 선라이즈〉 주인공들의 약속처럼 과연 내년 락페에서 만나기로 한 우리의 약속은 지켜질 것인가.\n가만히 앉아만 있어도 부자가 되네\n“가을 하면 어떤 색이 떠올라? 붉은색, 노란색? 아니면 주황?” 서울시 한강에 자리한 섬 선유도공원을 한가로이 거닐다가 친구가 물었다. 전날 남산에 갔다가 지인들과 가을과 색 이야기로 담소를 나눴다며 내게도 의견을 물었다. “글쎄, 음, 붉은색?”이라고 말하고 둘러보니 선유도공원은 붉음이 적다. 여름이 아직 거두어가지 않은 초록에 황금색, 단감색, 살구색, 갈색까지 낮은 채도의 나뭇잎들이 한들한들 시야를 채웠다. 고궁처럼 나무가 크고 화려하지 않고 위로 솟은 건축물도 없다. 절처럼 고즈넉하다.\n선유도공원은 봄가을에 연례행사처럼 온다. 거주지가 서울 서북부 쪽이라서 위치적으로도 가까우니 부담이 적다. 버스요금 1,450원만 내면 도착하는 비밀의 정원, 도시의 속도와 일의 피로감에서 해방시켜주는 나만의 힐링 스팟이다. 이곳을 한 바퀴 돌고 나면 비로소 가을에 속한 기분이 든다. 혼자 갈까 하다가 백수의 첫 가을을 맞는 친구가 떠올라서 문자를 넣었다. 약속을 잡으며 ‘선유도공원’ 버스 정류장이 있으니 거기서 11시에 보자고 했더니 거기 안다며 이런 문자가 왔다. “지나갈 때마다 내리고 싶은 충동을 느끼는 정류장이야.”\n공원의 가장자리, 한강 뷰 편의점 테이블에 자리를 잡았다. 저쪽에서 혼자 사발면을 먹는 사내를 제외하곤 우리뿐이다. 평일 오전에만 누릴 수 있는 호사다. 친구는 한강라면을 먹자고 했다. 봉지라면을 기호대로 고른 후 4,500원을 계산하면 일회용 대접 같은 그릇을 같이 준다. 그걸 라면 제조기에 올려두고 뜨거운 물을 부어 3분 조리하면 완성. 내 생애 첫 한강라면을 선유도에서 개시했다. 분식점 라면에서는 느낄 수 없는 하늘 맛, 바람 맛이 스프처럼 가미된 별미다. 운 좋으면 낙엽이 고명처럼 얹혀진다. 나는 동네맛집에서 사 온 4,000원짜리 야채김밥 두 줄을 펼쳐놓았다. 친구가 장바구니에서 합정역 지하도에서 포장해 온 떡볶이를 한 팩 꺼낸다. 소풍에 떡볶이 빠지면 서운하니까 샀다고.\n이름하여 선유도공원 정식이 차려졌다. 김밥, 라면, 떡볶이, 그리고 텀블러에 담아온 커피, 사과까지 놓으니 둥그런 테이블이 비좁다. 현재기온 15도. 가만히 앉아서 김밥 한 알 먹고 하늘 보고 라면 한 젓가락 후루룩 넘기고 강물 한 번 보고 떡볶이 한 입 베어물고 친구를 본다. 바다를 본 시인이 ‘바다는 넓다’를 읊조리듯이 ‘참 좋다’는 말이 절로 나왔다. 뜨거운 커피를 한 모금 마시고 눈으로는 파란 하늘을 길게 가르는 새 떼를 좇으며 나는 말했다.\n“이렇게 앉아 있으니까 부자가 된 거 같다.”\n“그러네. 부자네.”\n“부자는 가처분 시간이 많잖아. 일을 안 해도 생활비가 있고 힘든 노동을 최대한 외주를 줄 수 있으니까.”\n“근데 난 근처에서 회사를 10년이나 다녔으면서 여기 올 생각을 왜 한 번도 못 했을까...”\n직장은 돈을 주는 대신 시간을 압수한다. 시간만 가져가면 좋은데 마음도 도려내어 가져간다. 시간에 쫓기다 보면 누구라도 다정함을 잃지 않을 재간이 없다. 다정함이 사라지면 자동으로 관계도 틀어진다. 사람과의 관계 자연과의 관계 전부다. 친구는 회사를 그만두니까 단풍놀이도 다니고 좋다면서도 앞으로 먹고사는 불안이 떨쳐지지 않는다고 고백한다. 돈이 없으면 불안하고 시간이 없으면 불행한 삶의 딜레마.\n인간사 대부분은 마땅한 해결책이 없어서 그저 시간을 흘려보내는 게 약이다. 불안을 없애려 하지 말고 다른 정서로 잠시라도 불안을 잠시 낙오시키는 거다. 선유도공원의 가을이 주는 설렘 같은 강한 맛으로 불안 물리치기. 마음이 괜찮아서 놀러 가는 게 아니라 놀다 보면 괜찮아지기도 하는 거다. 돈으로 아픈 마음을 달래는 것을 두고 금융 치료라고 하던데, 우리는 ‘가을 치료’를 제대로 받았다. 20,000원도 채 안 되는 돈으로 배부르게 행복했으니까. “다음주만 해도 추워서 야외에서 한강라면 못 먹었을 거야.” 으쓱하며 날씨 어플을 켜니 다음주 기온은 5도까지 내려간다. 오늘 오길 잘했다. 같이 오길 잘했다.\n일전에 요양보호사 선생님을 인터뷰했다. 그에게 선생님이 보시니 어떤 노년이 행복하던가요? 하고 물었다. 그는 세 가지를 꼽았다. 요양원에 올 최소한의 돈, 추억, 그리고 관계. “내 옆 침대 어르신과 친구로 지내냐 적으로 지내냐. 여기도 관계예요.” 요양원은 집에 혼자 있을 때보다 훨씬 폭 넓은 인간관계를 맺어야 한다고 했다. 요양보호사, 자원봉사자, 프로그램 활동하는 분들, 예배드리는 분들, 청소하는 분들… 그들과 관계를 잘 맺는 어르신이 행복하다는 거다.\n그러면서 옆 침대에 자식이 없는 사람이 있는데도 아랑곳하지 않고 자기 자랑, 자식 자랑을 늘어놓는 눈치 없는 어르신이 문제가 된다고 귀띔했다. 돈과 추억이 많아도 관계가 틀어지면 외롭다고 했다. 나이가 들어도 똑같구나 싶어서 웃음이 났다. 내 삶을 단단히 다져줄 관계를 위해서는 돈보다 눈치를, 사람의 안색을 살피는 섬세함이 필수임을 잊지 않기로 한다. 관계는 생의 마지막까지 주어지는 숙제고, 존재의 피난처는 언제나 옆에 있는 사람이다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 이지영 Graphic 조수희\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}\n🔗 〈2025 토스픽〉 공유 이벤트\n소중한 사람에게 이 글을 공유해 보세요. \n⓵ 공유 버튼을 눌러 복사된 링크를 메신저, 블로그, SNS 등 원하는 채널로 공유하고, \n⓶ 공유한 화면을 캡처해 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스피드 인스타그램(@toss_feed) DM으로 보내면 참여 완료. \n매월 일상에 즐거움을 더해주는 선물을 준비했어요.  \n✱자세한 이벤트 선물과 참여 안내는 여기(링크)를 참고하세요.",

NASA 우주센터가 있는 휴스턴, 전투기 F-35 공장이 있는 댈러스, 테슬라 기가팩토리가 있는 오스틴까지 텍사스의 여러 도시를 돌아보며 ‘여기에 미국의 과거, 현재, 그리고 미래가 있구나!’라는 생각이 들었습니다.\n동시에 이런 인사이트도 얻었습니다.\n“미국은 앞으로도 계속 성장할 수 있다.”\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n성장 요인 1. 인구와 경제가 함께 커지고 있다\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}최근 5년간 텍사스 인구는 약 200만 명 증가했습니다. 이는 미국 모든 주 가운데 가장 큰 증가폭이에요. 텍사스의 현재 인구는 3,200만 명으로, 미국에서 인구 3,000만명이 넘는 주는 캘리포니아와 텍사스 단 두 곳뿐입니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n2000년 이후 연평균 경제성장률 또한 미국 주 중 1위입니다. 그만큼 일자리도 많이 늘어 2024년 신규 일자리 수는 28만 개에 달해요. 그럼에도 물가는 미국 평균보다 낮고, 주(州) 소득세도 0%예요. 그 덕분에 각지의 많은 사람이 텍사스로 모여들며 도시가 점점 더 성장하고 있습니다.\n\n성장 요인 2. 대기업이 몰린다\n텍사스는 기업 본사나 대형 공장이 들어서기에 매우 매력적인 입지를 갖고 있어요. 낮은 비용 구조, 친기업적 기조를 가진 지역 정부, 연방 보조금 등의 요인이 기업 유치에 큰 역할을 하고 있어요. 그리고 이는 다시 인재 유입과 고용 확대로 이어지면서 선순환 구조를 이룹니다.\n실제로 2024년 <포춘 500> 기업 중 텍사스에 본사를 둔 기업은 52곳으로, 미국 내에서 캘리포니아 다음으로 많은 수치입니다. 셰브론, 스페이스X, X(트위터)가 캘리포니아에서 이전해온 기업이라는 점을 고려하면, 머지않아 텍사스의 유치 기업 수가 캘리포니아를 앞지를 가능성도 있어요.\n\n성장 요인 3. 미래 산업이 자란다\n우주 산업, 무인 자율주행차 같은 미래 핵심 산업도 텍사스에서 발전을 도모하고 있어요.\n1) 우주 산업\n1960년대부터 유인 우주 비행의 핵심 기지로 구축된 휴스턴 존슨우주센터는 인류 귀환 달 탐사 프로젝트 ‘아르테미스’의 중추 기능을 수행하고 있어요. 달 탐사 미션 운영에 필요한 인프라와 전문 인력, 협력 네트워크가 이곳에 모여있기 때문이에요.\n2) 무인 자율주행차\n자율주행 기업들도 텍사스를 테스트베드*로 활용하고 있어요. 지난 6월 테슬라의 로보택시 시범 운행이 오스틴에서 시작됐고, 아마존이 인수한 죽스(Zoox) 역시 이곳에서 자율주행차 시험 주행을 발표했어요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 새로운 기술이나 제품을 실제 환경에서 시험·검증하기 위한 장소나 시스템\n텍사스는 2017년 별도의 법을 제정해, 일정 안전 요건을 충족하면 운전자 없이 자율주행차를 운행할 수 있도록 허용했어요. 게다가 테슬라의 경우, 본사와 기가텍사스 공장이 인근에 있어 차량 생산부터 소프트웨어 업데이트, 차량 운영까지 모두 한 지역에서 통합적으로 이뤄질 수 있다는 강점이 있습니다.\n텍사스만이 아닙니다\n미국에는 텍사스 외에도 성장하는 주가 더 있습니다. 각기 다른 산업을 기반으로 성장 엔진을 돌리고 있죠.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px 0 8px;padding:0;list-style:none;}.css-uswsmm ul,.css-uswsmm ol{margin:16px 0 0;}.css-uswsmm>li{margin-bottom:16px;padding-left:24px;}.css-uswsmm>li:last-of-type{margin-bottom:0;}.css-uswsmm>li>span{position:relative;}.css-uswsmm>li>span>:first-child::before{content:'•';font-weight:500;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);position:absolute;left:-24px;}\n.css-1hwiibq{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);}\n플로리다: 금융 및 럭셔리 부동산\n조지아: 전기차 및 배터리와 물류산업\n워싱턴: 클라우드와 항공우주\n\n‘The United States of America’라는 이름처럼, 미국은 단일 경제가 아닌 거대 주들의 연합체입니다. 그래서 여러 지역이 동시에 성장 사이클을 만들어낼 수 있죠. 어떤 지역이 경기 둔화를 겪더라도 다른 지역의 호황이 이를 상쇄할 수 있는 거예요.\n실제로 텍사스, 플로리다, 조지아, 워싱턴 등 새로운 성장 거점들은 현재 뉴욕과 캘리포니아를 합친 것 못지않은 수준으로 미국 경제 성장에 기여하고 있습니다. 이는 단일 지역에 의존하지 않고, 다층적인 성장 기반을 갖췄다는 점에서 의미가 큽니다. 미국의 미래 성장은 월스트리트나 실리콘밸리뿐 아니라 텍사스를 비롯한 새로운 무대에서도 이뤄지고 있는 것입니다.\n\n투자자가 주목해야 할 것은?\n텍사스를 비롯한 새로운 성장 지역들이 부상할수록 투자자는 그 지역의 산업 흐름에 주목할 필요가 있습니다. 이들 지역에서도 아래에 정리한 세 산업 분야는 앞으로의 매출 성장이 특히 기대됩니다.\n\n전력·유틸리티 기업: 인구 유입과 산업 재편으로 인한 전력 수요 증가로 수혜를 입을 것으로 전망됩니다.\n주택·건설·건자재 기업: 늘어나는 인구만큼 주택 수요도 증가하고 있습니다. 이에 따라 건설·자재 기업과 주택 개발사들이 신규 프로젝트를 활발히 진행하며 성장을 이어갈 것으로 보입니다.\n지역은행: 이주민과 기업이 늘고, 부동산 프로젝트가 성장하면서 지역 은행들의 예금 및 대출이 늘고 있습니다.\n\n💡 다음 글 예고\n\n다음 편에서는 워싱턴 D.C.와 텍사스를 방문하면서 확인한 ‘주목할 산업’에 대해 전해드리려 합니다. 첫 번째 산업으로는 요즘 큰 화두인 ‘로봇’과 ‘자율주행’을 다룰 예정이니, 많이 기대해주세요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter 이지선 애널리스트 Edit 기명균 윤동해 Graphic 윤자영, 하정윤",
