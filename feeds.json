        "content:encodedSnippet": "Another year and another CppCon is all wrapped up! Microsoft was pleased to once again be an exhibitor and to have several of our employees present sessions at the conference. Here are my major takeaways from the keynotes, sessions, conversations, and the general vibe.\nAI tooling is finding a footing with the C++ community. The next year is going to see the reliability and usefulness of those tools jump drastically.\nVisual Studio users consistently name the debugger as one of the best features of the product.\nLots of folks are getting excited about the static reflection capabilities in C++26.\nThe week before CppCon, we announced Visual Studio 2026 and Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50, and the conference gave us a great opportunity to let you know what you can expect in the new release and for you to give us your feedback. We highly encourage you to try out the Insiders release and let us know what your experience is like.\nThis is a long post, so here’s a table of contents to help you navigate if you are only interested in specific parts:\nThe Microsoft Booth\nKeynotes\nMicrosoft Sessions\nOther Sessions of Interest\nWrapping It Up\nNow, let’s get into some of the details from the conference.\nThe Microsoft Booth\n     \n \nConference attendees often describe the “hallway track” as a hidden gem of in-person attendance, and as a tool vendor, the exhibition hall serves a similar function: providing a way to broadly understand what the community and our users are looking for from our products. We really do value your feedback, and we appreciate everyone who came by to talk to us or to fill out our feedback survey. We even managed to get in a couple of deeper, private, in-person conversations with users to really dig into what they want from their tools.\nSurvey\nThe survey we conducted ended up with over 170 unique entries, and from those entries, we randomly selected raffle winners for some great LEGO® prizes. Congratulations to the winner!\n        \n\nKeynotes\nConcept-Based Generic Programming – Bjarne Stroustrup\n\nBjarne’s keynote on generic programming with C++ concepts was focused on showing how concepts, which were added in C++20, are one tool in the toolbox for writing code that can reinforce safety and encapsulate differences between types so that code can be written in a way that it doesn’t have to repeatedly handle all the special cases.\nI was particularly fond of the idea of using values as concept parameters to encode into the type system certain expectations about a type, such as maximum object size, which is important in many serialization, caching, and performance optimization scenarios. It’s a much better solution than my existing preference of using static_assert to check object size directly after the type declaration.\nCrafting The Code You Don’t Write: Sculpting Software in an AI World – Daisy Hollman\n\nI didn’t get a chance to see Daisy’s talk live at the conference, but I caught it on the CppCon Video Archive afterwards. Daisy gives a great talk as usual, balancing sharp technical insight and examples that make them relevant to the viewers’ everyday problems. In this case, it was about understanding LLMs and how they work so that you might understand why they give the sorts of completions that they give based on your prompt. Ultimately, they respond to our prompts and the context we provide, and each model will respond differently.\nOne of my favorite things from the talk was the idea that you should think of LLM-based AI assistants “like junior engineers who have read the whole internet.” This is very similar to my description from my Meeting C++ 2023 talk AI Assistants for C++ Developers “as a very eager, over-confident beginner with access to an enormous library and the skills to quickly find and collate information.” Of course, Daisy puts it much more succinctly.\nReflection: C++’s Decade-Defining Rocket Engine – Herb Sutter\n\nI haven’t gotten around to watching Herb’s talk, but I’m looking forward to it soon. Let us know in the comments what you think about it if you were there or after you’ve watched it on YouTube!\nMore Speed & Simplicity: Practical Data-Oriented Design in C++ – Vittorio Romeo\n\nLike with Herb’s talk, I haven’t gotten a chance to watch Vittorio’s keynote. I’m a pretty big fan of data-oriented design so I’m interested in what Vittorio has to say about it. Let us know what you think of his talk in the comments!\nC++: Some Assembly Required – Matt Godbolt\n\nMatt’s closing keynote session was wide-ranging and quite good, as usual. He walked through the different dictionary definitions of assembly and how they applied to C++ and the C++ community, often in surprisingly meaningful ways. Of course, he’s most well known for Compiler Explorer, which lets you view the generated binary code for your C++ code in a variety of assembly language syntaxes. There was content on technical topics like that, but also some rather inspiring and thoughtful content on softer topics as well. Highly recommended viewing.\nMicrosoft Sessions\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025 – David Li and Augustin Popa\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk, Augustin and David go into a lot more detail of the changes that are coming in the new versions of Visual Studio and the MSVC Build Tools. Here are some of the highlights:\nGitHub Copilot Agent Mode is now available in Visual Studio. Agents can better understand intent, plan actions, and carry out tasks with less user guidance. You can provide further context to GitHub Copilot by using a custom instructions file to let it know about the preferred conventions and rules for your repo or organization, like how to add unit tests, what style you prefer for comments, and what your priorities are in terms of the quality of your code.\n\nOne of our biggest features this year is Dynamic Debugging, which allows you to deoptimize code on the fly while debugging, making the debugger more useful for projects that are performance sensitive. You will be able to see all your local variables, step reliably, and step into force inline functions. While this feature was inspired by our game dev partners, it is useful for all C++ applications that use debug and release configurations.\n\nFor the MSVC Build Tools, we continue our progress towards C++23 conformance with support for formatting ranges, std::generator, lambda attributes, and more. We also continued to improve the runtime performance of code built with the latest build tools.\nWe fixed 387 C++ issues and implemented 29 C++ feature requests in the past year.\nThere are many UI improvements in Visual Studio 2026, including 11 colorful themes to choose from, an updated Settings experience, and a dockable all-in-one search window.\nOther productivity improvements include automatic word wrap indentation, enhanced line and column navigation, a better Change Signature experience, and the ability to save files with your preferred encoding format.\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents – Alexandra Kemper\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis session highlighted several important improvements and new features, covering extensions like the C/C++ extension, the CMake Tools extension, and GitHub Copilot extension.\nPerformance is one of the major areas of feedback received for the C/C++ extension, and the latest versions have changes that significantly speed up project startup times and reduce the time for source to be parsed and colorized in the editor. Benchmarks show up to 4x faster colorization for large codebases.\nThe CMake Tools extension now supports version 10 of CMake Presets which adds features like adding comments in the JSON presets files via the “$comment” field and additional support for generating a project dependency graph with Graphviz. By popular demand, the CMake Tools extension now has full language service protocol (LSP) support for CMake, as well as the option to exclude specific CMake folders from the project view for easier code navigation.\nGitHub Copilot support in Visual Studio Code is also improving rapidly, with various AI agents available to users today. Visual Studio Code also has great support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables the creation of tools to perform specific actions and exposes those tools to agents. Beyond the agent improvements, Visual Studio Code has also been making GitHub Copilot completions more context-aware and tailored to common C++ coding patterns, and next edit suggestions (NES) can predict the next expected change based on your previous changes and the coding patterns, making changes that span many lines in your codebase much easier.\nAll features covered in the talk are already publicly available; try them out today and let us know what you think!\n\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugger: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code – Eric Brumer\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nEric’s talk covered the use of C++ Dynamic Debugging to effectively debug your optimized code. You don’t have to worry about any more ‘variable was optimized away’ messages, and taking normal debugger actions like step-over and step-into behaves exactly as you would expect it to. It also covered the underlying technical details which make the feature powerful, easy to use, and fast to build.\nLearn more at https://aka.ms/vcdd and https://aka.ms/dynamicdebugging.\n   \nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]! – Inbal Levi\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThe talk introduces the static reflection feature that was voted into the Library Evolution Working Group (LEWG) in the C++ standard committee, which reviewed the design of the library side of the reflection feature. The session introduced reflection and its transformative potential within our codebases. After a brief history and introduction of utilities from the latest reflection proposal, Inbal explored the possibilities for “Reflection Libraries” and demonstrated potential directions for future improvements.\n  \nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) – Ben McMorran\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nBen’s talk was all about why the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is needed to address a variety of problems that AI assistants encounter when they want to evolve beyond a simple chat interface. The MCP solves these problems by providing an open and standard way for tools to provide context and actions to AI agents. For me, the most interesting part of the talk was seeing an MCP agent get implemented and seeing just how simple, yet powerful, they can be. They really form a major backbone of a successful agentic AI system.\n\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI – Ion Todirel\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIon’s talk was about practical advice for using AI tools, specifically for embedded and systems programming tasks. The advice offered was based on real-world problems and attempts to solve them using the AI tools that exist today. I’d say that a lot of the points made are relevant to tasks outside of that domain as well, and a key takeaway I had was that if at first your prompt doesn’t succeed, prompt again. Eventually, with enough experience (and advice) you’ll improve your prompts to get the most effective results and save you time when using an AI assistant.\n    \nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial – Michael Price\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nThis was my talk and I had a lot of fun preparing and presenting it. I walk through some of the key things that a C++ developer needs to know to get started with game development, focusing on Blender, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio 2026. The key takeaway for this talk is that while getting into game development can be intimidating due to unfamiliar tools and techniques, modern tools really lower the barrier. You can make simple 3D game assets in just a few minutes and easily import them into your project, and making your existing C++ code available to Unreal Engine is actually not that hard.\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop – Victor Ciura\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nHybrid C++/Rust codebases are quickly becoming more common – at Microsoft and everywhere in the industry. Having seamless interop between the C++ and Rust components is essential for the success of this symbiosis. There are many challenges in this process, but people found various ways to make things work – from dealing with ABI compatibility and platform/toolchain guarantees, to going down to C and FFI, to various techniques and tools for generating glue-code between the two languages. Many of the explored solutions so far by the community fail to deliver on all the needed requirements, swinging the wide range between performant and ergonomic. Victor highlighted all the interop challenges, some of the good solutions out there, and teased out the avenues at the forefront of this pursuit.\n\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Bharat Kumar\n\nC++ remains a foundational language for high-performance applications, but its lack of inherent memory safety and prevalence of undefined behaviors pose serious challenges. Rewriting the vast corpus of existing C++ code into a memory-safe language isn’t feasible in the short term, especially for large-scale projects like Microsoft Edge, which is built atop Chromium’s predominantly C++ codebase. Fortunately, meaningful safety improvements are possible without a full rewrite. Chandranath and Bharat explore how the Edge team systematically addresses safety across four core dimensions: bounds checking, lifetime management, initialization correctness, and type safety. These efforts are grounded in real-world engineering constraints and aim to reduce exploitable vulnerabilities while preserving performance. They also delve into complementary initiatives targeting thread safety, definition safety, and the mitigation of other undefined behaviors. By combining targeted refactoring, static analysis, and safer abstractions, the Microsoft Edge team is charting a pragmatic path toward more resilient C++ code. The session offers insights into scalable safety strategies that can be adopted across large legacy codebases.\n    \nBack to Basics: Code Review – Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIn this talk Chandranath and Kathleen examined examples of common C++ coding mistakes the Microsoft Edge team has come across when reviewing code and shared practical strategies to avoid them. They explored best practices for variable scoping, iteration, function and class design, and useful STL functions and algorithms. The talk also provided clang-tidy checks and warnings to use to catch these common issues.\nC++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects – Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nPrithvi and Kathleen’s session focused on techniques to prevent copying or moving objects in favor of in-place construction. It included many code examples with clang-tidy checks and warnings you can use to point out the potential areas of improvement in your own code. They highlighted guidelines such as passing non-trivial objects by reference, using view types, leveraging in-place constructors, best practices for containers like using emplace and transparent comparators, and finally eliminating runtime cost by moving computation to compile time.\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second – Daniel Lemire (Université du Québec) and Francisco Geiman Thiesen (Microsoft)\nCheck back later for the session video. We’ll post it here when it’s available.\n\nIt is fair to say that reflection was one of the latest additions to the library that has attracted the most attention and it was a subject discussed in many of the talks in this edition of CppCon.\nIn this talk Daniel and Francisco discussed their experience integrating the latest C++26 reflection proposal into the open source simdjson library. A few interesting takeaways from the talk:\nReflection allows the user to deserialize/serialize their types without having to write any boilerplate code; something that previously took a LOT of boilerplate.\nYou can get best-in-class performance by using reflection together with several optimizations, even when extending a library that was designed only with deserialization in mind.\nFor now this is an experimental feature already available in the library. It should gain more traction whenever the latest reflection proposal is added to MSVC, GCC, and\nHandling JSON is a poster-child use case for reflection and they went above and beyond to integrate that into the simdjson library, while still following its design principles and guaranteeing the absolute best performance.\nSlides are publicly available in: C++26 Reflection for JSON Serialization – A Practical Journey\n\nOther Sessions of Interest\nIn addition to the keynotes and our own Microsoft sessions, here are some sessions I managed to catch during my very busy week that I thought were interesting.\nPanel: What We Learned About AI Tools For C++ Engineers – Guy Davidson, Daisy Hollman, Inbal Levi, Jason Turner, Matt Godbolt, Michael Wong\nThe conference hosted a panel on the topic of AI for C++ Engineers, on which senior members of the C++ training, tooling, and authoring community offered their experience of using these tools, how they have improved their workflow, where the shortcomings are, and what the ideal future will hold. They are also keen to hear the experiences of other engineers who have experimented with AI tools.\nCommittee Fireside Chat – Herb Sutter, Jeff Garland, Andrei Alexandrescu, Bjarne Stroustrup, Gabriel Dos Reis, Inbal Levi, Guy Davidson, Timur Doumler, Barry Revzin, Nina Ranns, Khalil Estell, Vittorio Romeo, Ruslan Arutyunyan, Daisy Hollman\nIf you’d like to learn more about C++26’s additions of static reflection, async model (std::execution), contracts, and significant safety improvements, this is the session for you.\nWrapping It Up\nCongrats, you made it to the end! Thanks for reading through all the way. Be sure to come back and check out the Microsoft C++ blog (this one!) over the coming weeks as we make new announcements for Visual Studio 2026 and all of our other C++ products, and we hope to see you all next September in Aurora!\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 getting closer to General Availability (GA), we want to share with you how you can upgrade your projects from your current versions of Visual Studio and the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools to the latest versions. The new IDE ships with the v145 platform toolset for MSBuild C++ projects and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. In this post, I will walk you through the process step-by-step, while explaining some of the features available to you to make the transition as painless as possible. Overall, our goal is to help you get current and stay current.\nStep 1: Try out Visual Studio 2026\nAs of September 9, 2025, you can install Visual Studio 2026 Insiders. Once the stable release of Visual Studio 2026 ships, you will be able to download it from the same link. You can choose between Visual Studio Community, Professional, or Enterprise as before. Visual Studio instances can be installed side-by-side from the Visual Studio Installer application, so you can keep your current version of Visual Studio while exploring 2026.\nIf you are not ready to fully migrate yet, you can load your existing Visual Studio MSBuild (.sln/.vcxproj) projects in Visual Studio 2026 and retain compatibility with your existing copy of Visual Studio without having to upgrade the project files.\nStep 2: Migrate to Visual Studio 2026, stay on existing MSVC Build Tools\nIf you’re satisfied with your Visual Studio 2026 experience and are ready to use it daily, you can do so without needing to use the latest MSVC Build Tools. The installer for Visual Studio 2026 gives you the ability to install your existing C++ build tools going back as far as Visual Studio 2015. You can select multiple components/versions to include for your Visual Studio instance.\n\nHowever, there is an even easier way to get started in Visual Studio 2026 and stay on your existing MSVC toolset version.\nInstall missing tools with Visual Studio setup assistant\nYou can use the new setup assistant experience to install missing tools and/or retarget any projects that are ready to move forward. You do not have to install and upgrade everything all at once.\n\nThis assistant will appear by default when you load your solution for the first time, or you can right-click the solution and select Retarget solution. To stay on a project’s existing toolset version and install any missing tools, choose the “Install missing Platform Toolset…” option. You can also click the Install All button to instantly set all the dropdowns to that option. If you already have the correct toolset version installed and want to stay on it, no action needs to be taken.\nYou will also see options to retarget your projects. You can go back and select these later when you are ready to move your projects and toolset version forward to the latest. Retargeting will update the Windows SDK Version, Platform Toolset, and MSVC Build Tools Version project properties. You may select what to do for each project or retarget all of them at once with the Retarget all button.\nFundamentally, the setup assistant allows you to upgrade gradually at your own pace.\nStep 3: Upgrade MSVC Build Tools to version 14.50\nWhen you decide it’s the right time to upgrade and explore the latest MSVC toolset, the process is designed to be as straightforward as possible. Visual Studio aims to support you to get current and stay current on the latest tools.\nWhy you should upgrade your C++ build tools\nBy upgrading, you get access to new C++ language updates and bug fixes in the Microsoft C++ compiler and standard library. In addition, if you upgrade, you get runtime performance improvements:\nUp to +6%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3%, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nRetarget your projects with the setup assistant\nAs mentioned previously, the setup assistant can help you retarget your projects, so they build with the latest MSVC Build Tools.\n\nBelow is a quick video demonstration of the setup assistant in action to install missing tools and retarget projects.\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/10/setup-assistant.mp4\n\nThere are the new MSVC components in the Visual Studio Installer.\n\nComponents marked as “Latest” will be updated to the latest available version when you update the IDE, while components with a major and minor version number will remain on that minor version and only receive servicing updates while in support.\nC++ binary compatibility for step-by-step upgrades\nWe’re announcing that MSVC Build Tools version 14.50 preserves binary compatibility with any code built with MSVC tools shipped in Visual Studio 2015 or later. You don’t need to rebuild all your projects and external dependencies all at once. The Microsoft Visual C++ v14 Redistributable, which ships the Visual C++ v14 Runtime, also continues to maintain this binary compatibility. Note: there are a few restrictions with the binary compatibility experience, which you should review in our documentation.\nAs a result of this binary compatibility, you can upgrade your code step-by-step, component by component. You can also update your main application while your external dependencies remain on an older version. For your third party open-source dependencies, you can use the vcpkg package manager to rebuild them with the latest toolset or any previous MSVC toolset shipping in Visual Studio 2026.\nStep 4: Upgrade MSVC with GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++\nBut wait, there’s more! GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ helps you migrate your C++ projects to the latest MSVC Build Tools. After you retarget your project, you may need to make additional source code or project system changes due to deprecations or fixes in the newer toolset. Copilot will help you iterate through these changes until all warnings and errors are resolved. GitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is coming soon to Visual Studio 2026 in Private Preview. Check out our announcement post for more information and join the waitlist.\nGet Current, Stay Current\nOur goal is for you to have a painless upgrade to Visual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools version 14.50. If you run into any issues with your upgrade, please don’t hesitate to contact us at vcupgrade@microsoft.com and feel free to drop a comment below.

Recently, you’ve shared important feedback about AI usage limits, transparency, and the freedom to choose which AI providers you use. We heard you loud and clear.\nThat’s why we are working to introduce bring-your-own-key (BYOK) support for JetBrains AI Assistant and Junie. Simply put, BYOK will allow you to connect your personal accounts from OpenAI (or any compatible API) and Anthropic so you can use them directly in your JetBrains IDE. This feature will later be extended to work with Google Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and even self-hosted local models, and you will even be able to use it without a JetBrains AI subscription.\nWhy BYOK?\nWe understand that quotas can feel restrictive, and unclear usage policies can lead to frustration. With the BYOK feature, you will no longer be limited to JetBrains-managed quotas. Instead, you will use your own existing AI provider accounts, gaining clear visibility into your usage and costs directly from your provider.\nWhat will this mean for you?\nFreedom of choice: Pick your preferred AI model or provider. Whether it’s the latest cutting-edge model from Anthropic or Google, or a cost-efficient local model hosted on your own servers, you will decide what best suits your workflow.\n\n\n\n\nFull transparency: Clearly see how much each AI interaction costs in real time on your selected platform, without worrying about hidden quotas or unexpected interruptions.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and security: Your API keys will remain securely stored and managed on your own machine and will never be shared with JetBrains. Your data will stay between you and your chosen AI provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an open ecosystem\nWith planned support for industry standards like the OpenAI API, ACP (Agent Client Protocol), Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol, and other common interfaces, JetBrains is committed to creating an open ecosystem. This approach means your IDE will become a hub that’s open to all current – and future – AI providers, without forcing vendor lock-in.\nWhat’s next?\nWe expect to add this feature by the end of the year, and this is just the beginning of our journey. We’re currently also working on expanding the range of supported AI providers, simplifying configurations, and refining features based on your feedback.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and learn which features you’d like us to prioritize next.

        "pubDate": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:07:54 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we approach the release of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we would like to share key information about changes that may impact your plugin development process. This post addresses common questions from the developer community and provides guidance on maintaining compatibility with the latest IntelliJ Platform versions.\nNo Immediate Upgrade Required\nIf you built your plugin against the IntelliJ Platform 2025.2 or earlier, it should remain compatible with 2025.3. You don’t need to rush to update right away.\nTip: Check compatibility locally by running the verifyPlugin Gradle task. This performs the same IntelliJ Plugin Verifier checks that are automatically run on JetBrains Marketplace when you upload plugin updates.\nThe IntelliJ Platform maintains strong backward compatibility, which generally preserves between minor versions. It means you can take your time testing and migrating your plugins.\nMajor Change: Unified Platform Distribution\nWhat’s Changing?\nStarting with version 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA Community and Ultimate will be delivered as a unified platform. This marks a significant architectural change that makes plugin development and distribution easier. Read the full announcement: IntelliJ IDEA Moves to the Unified Distribution.\nStarting with 2025.1, PyCharm has undergone the same unification. Learn more in the PyCharm Unified blog post.\nNote: These updates only affect plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later. If your plugin still uses the IntelliJ Platform in version 2025.2 or earlier, no changes are needed at this time. References to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Community for older versions continue working.\nKey Implications for Plugin Developers\nWith the unified distribution:\nIntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (IC) builds for 2025.3 and later are no longer available. Trying to resolve artifacts using IC-2025.3, IC-253.x.y, or the intellijIdeaCommunity() dependency helper will cause an error.\nFor version 2025.3 and future versions, you must target intellijIdea() as a platform artifact.\nWhen targeting PyCharm 2025.1 and above, use ⁠pycharm(version) instead of ⁠pycharmCommunity(version) and ⁠pycharmProfessional(version).\nThe unified distribution retains the same IU product code as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nThe difference between Community and Ultimate now depends on licensing and feature access, not separate IDE distributions. All IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate plugins are included in the distribution but are disabled if there is no active subscription.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) is available in a unified distribution and does not require a subscription.\nDepending on Paid Functionality\nIf your plugin requires subscription-based features, you can explicitly depend on com.intellij.modules.ultimate. This module represents the licensing mechanism; when a user doesn’t have an active subscription, this module and all plugins that depend on it are disabled.\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.ultimate</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nWhat Does This Mean for Your Users?\nUsers upgrading from IntelliJ IDEA Community 2025.2  will be smoothly transitioned to the unified IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 as part of a regular version update. All plugins will continue working. \nThe free tier now offers additional features:\nBasic database functions (schema viewing, SQL completion).\nProject wizards for Spring Boot, Ktor, and other frameworks.\nBasic syntax highlighting for frameworks.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration (previously only available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate).\nRequirements\nTo work with version 2025.3, update the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\nplugins {\n  id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nWhen targeting 2025.3 for development, you must use the new ⁠intellijIdea() dependency helper—whether your plugin targets IntelliJ IDEA specifically or all other IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform.\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        // or intellijIdeaUltimate(\"2025.2\")\n\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\nWhen targeting PyCharm specifically, use the pycharm() dependency:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharmCommunity(\"2024.3\")\n        // or pycharmProfessional(\"2024.3\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharm(\"2025.3\")\n    }\n}\nSee the Step-by-Step Migration Guide below for detailed instructions on updating your plugin.\nOpen Source and Custom IDEs\nFor developers building custom IDEs or using the open source version:\nThe open source code remains available on GitHub at JetBrains/intellij-community.\nGitHub Actions are now provided to simplify the process of building the IDE from source.\nPre-built open source versions can be found on GitHub Releases.\nThe open-source build utilizes the Community Edition (IC) product code and is compatible with all plugins that work with the Community Edition.\nCustom IDEs, like Android Studio, continue to function as before.\nKey API Changes in 2025.3\nModule Extraction and Explicit Dependencies\nSeveral modules have been separated from the core plugin into their own modules, each with its own individual classloader. While this does not affect binary compatibility, it is advisable to explicitly depend on the modules you need using bundledModule(moduleName):\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth.base\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.backend\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.protocolReaderRuntime\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.ui\nintellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\nintellij.platform.vcs.log\nintellij.platform.vcs.log.graph\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.log\")\n    }\n}\nIntelliLang Plugin Dependency Change\nIf your plugin relies on the org.intellij.intelliLang plugin, declare a dependency on the bundled module intellij.platform.langInjection:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"org.intellij.intelliLang\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.langInjection\")\n    }\n}\nStorage Annotation Restriction\nThe @Storage annotation can no longer be used at the top level. It must only be used within @State.storages.\n@Service\n@State(name = \"MySettings\", storages = [Storage(\"MySettings.xml\")])\nclass MySettings : PersistentStateComponent<MySettings> {\n\n  var myProperty = false\n\n  override fun getState() = this\n\n  override fun loadState(state: MySettings) = XmlSerializerUtil.copyBean(state, this)\n\n  companion object {\n    fun getInstance(): MySettings = service()\n  }\n}\nWhy Explicit Dependencies Matter\nDeclaring explicit dependencies on the plugins and modules your plugin uses is a best practice. It makes your plugin’s requirements clear to both the platform and other developers, ensures proper dependency loading order, and helps JetBrains Marketplace determine product compatibility.\nUnderstanding Dependencies: Gradle Build Script vs plugin.xml\nDependencies on plugins and modules defined in your Gradle build script, using the plugin(), bundledPlugin(), and bundledModule() dependency helpers, interact with the compilation classpath to ensure they are available during plugin development. However, to make them available at runtime for your plugin, it’s also required to define them in your plugin.xml file. See the Plugin Dependencies documentation for details.\nExample with plugin dependencies\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.java</depends>\n    <depends>org.intellij.scala</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nExample with plugin and bundled module dependencies\nIf your plugin depends on bundled modules, you must use the plugin model v2 dependencies definition, which requires the <dependencies> block with a clear separation between plugin and module dependencies.\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <dependencies>\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.modules.platform\" />\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.java\" />\n        <plugin id=\"org.intellij.scala\" />\n        <module name=\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\" />\n    </dependencies>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nThis ensures that your plugin can compile with these dependencies during development and access them at runtime when users install it.\nStep-by-Step Migration Guide\nUpdate Your Gradle Plugin Version\nUpdate the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version, currently 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\n[org.jetbrains.intellij.platform] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is outdated: 2.10.0. Update `org.jetbrains.intellij.platform` to: 2.10.4\nTo update your setup to the latest version, simply increase the plugin version in the build.gradle.kts file or the ./gradle/libs.versions.toml if applicable.\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nTesting Against 2025.3 Before Official Release\nEven if your plugin is designed for older versions of the IntelliJ Platform, it can still be used in future releases. To ensure compatibility with newer IDEs than the SDK you use, utilize the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier tool to check binary compatibility against other IntelliJ Platform versions.\nIn build.gradle.kts specify:\nintellijPlatform {\n   pluginVerification {\n        ides {\n            recommended()\n        }\n    }\n}\nNext, run the verifyPlugin Gradle task to perform the verification and identify any potential issues that require attention.\nIt is also possible to manually run a specific IDE with a different version than the one set for development, with your plugin loaded. To do this, register a new runEap Gradle task and execute it immediately afterward.\nval runEap by intellijPlatformTesting.runIde.registering {\n    type = IntelliJPlatformType.IntellijIdea\n    version = \"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\"\n    useInstaller = false\n}\nSwitching to 2025.3 for development\nImportant: The installer for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 will only be available once 2025.3 is officially released. Until then, if you want to test your plugin against 2025.3 early, you have two options:\nUse a specific EAP release\nAll published JetBrains IDEs available for download are ready for use by all users and should also be used for plugin development to reflect our customers’ needs. To do this, you can simply add the IntelliJ Platform dependency using intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). However, if such a version is not yet available, you can refer to early access releases, which include their build numbers, available on the IntelliJ IDEA EAP download page or in a machine-readable JSON feed.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253.27864.23\")\n    }\n}\nUse snapshot versions\nJetBrains IDEs are also released as snapshots in the IntelliJ Platform Artifacts Repositories. To switch to these intermediate releases, you need to opt out of the installer artifacts and use a version specific to the IntelliJ Snapshots Maven Repository.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\") {\n            useInstaller = false\n        }\n    }\n}\nOnce 2025.3 is officially released, simply use intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). For more details, see the Target Versions documentation.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I need to update my plugin immediately when 2025.3 is released?\nNo, plugins built for 2025.2 or older versions should still work with 2025.3.\nWhat if my plugin only supports versions earlier than 2025.3?\nNo changes needed. The older syntax (intellijIdeaCommunity(version), intellijIdeaUltimate(version), pycharmCommunity(version), and pycharmProfessional(version)) still works for older versions.\nWill my plugin work with both free-tier and paid subscription users?\nYes, using the intellijIdea(\"2025.3\") makes your plugin work for all users regardless of subscription status.\nDo I need to build multiple versions of my plugin for 2025.2 and 2025.3?\nNo. The platform type you specify in your build script is only used during plugin development. Your plugin.xml file contains the actual compatibility information through <depends> declarations and the since-build attribute. A single plugin build can work across multiple IDE versions.\nGradle fails with “Could not find idea:ideaIC:253.x.x”. What should I do?\nThis occurs because Community Edition builds are not available for versions 2025.3 and later. You have two options:\nUse an older version of IntelliJ IDEA Community for building, which will still make your plugin compatible with 2025.3.\nUpgrade the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to 2.10.4 and switch to intellijIdea(version).\nIf 2025.3 has not been released yet, you can use EAP by specifying a build number as the version.\nSet the version to 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT and set useInstaller = false.\nHow do I know which modules to include explicitly in dependencies?\nThe IntelliJ Plugin Verifier will report missing dependencies. Refer to the Key API Changes in 2025.3 section above.\nHow can I test against 2025.3 before the official release?\nUse specific EAP build numbers or snapshot versions, such as 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT, with useInstaller set to false. See Testing Against 2025.3 Before Official Release above.\nWhat versioning scheme should I use if I need separate builds for different versions?\nUse a SemVer-compatible scheme with suffixes, such as 1.2.3-251 for the 2025.1 version and 1.2.3-253 for the 2025.3 version. JetBrains Marketplace will automatically serve the correct version based on the user’s IDE version and your since-build and until-build attributes.\nConclusion\nThe IntelliJ Platform 2025.3 release introduces a unified IntelliJ IDEA distribution while maintaining strong backward compatibility. Plugins built for earlier IntelliJ Platform versions will still work with 2025.3, giving you time to migrate at your own pace.\nWhen you’re ready to target 2025.3, update to IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.10.4 or later and switch to the new intellijIdea() dependency helper. The platform APIs stay consistent across all license types, ensuring that your plugin works the same way for all users. Declare explicit dependencies on the modules you need, and use the verifyPlugin task to test compatibility before publishing.\nGot questions? Contact us on the JetBrains Platform Forum.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Every developer recognises the trade-off. You can take the shortcut that delivers today but breaks tomorrow, or choose the slower approach that earns lasting confidence.\nThis dilemma has become even more poignant with the widespread integration of AI agents into real workflows. Speed feels tempting, but speed without trust usually wastes more time than it saves.\nThe essential question is not how fast agents can act, but how trustworthy they are when they act. Productivity grows when trust and speed work in unison – with trust being the crucial starting point.\nHow AI agents take us further than automation\nAI agents are software collaborators that transform goals into actions. They extend beyond simple automation because they make decisions: when to act, when to ask for feedback, and which tools to use. Unlike scripts that only execute predefined steps, agents respond to context and adjust as they go.\nA single agent can be useful, but multi-agent systems push the idea further. Rather than one agent trying to cover every step, multiple agents can specialize, share context, and divide tasks. This creates collaboration that feels more like a team at work – reducing friction, adding resilience, and accelerating progress.\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows and orchestration are essential to effective collaboration. Agents need a way to coordinate, hand off tasks, and adapt their actions in real time. With the right structure, multiagents can move beyond isolated contributions and operate as a coherent system, unlocking the full potential of agentic workflows.\nEarly use cases: Promising but with practical limits\nAgents already show value in routine development tasks, outperforming humans in many basic use cases. They can surface relevant classes in a large codebase, identify inefficient patterns and propose refactoring, or manage project operations such as running tests and summarising documentation.\nAll these capabilities can ease cognitive load and free time for higher-level design, but this added value comes with risk: Agents may hallucinate, introduce insecure code, or miss compliance requirements.\nLike junior collaborators, they’re helpful only with review and strong guardrails. With this said, can developers trust them enough to handle more critical work?\nAgents as junior collaborators\nWhen a junior collaborator joins a development team, they arrive eager and capable, but their contributions require supervision. Over time, with the right tools – such as a reliable IDE, debugging support, version control, and testing frameworks – they learn to deliver results that the team can trust.\nAgents follow the same path. They handle repetition easily, but without a strong infrastructure, capable tools, and clearly defined workflows, their work risks introducing errors or compliance breaches.\nJetBrains has always helped developers grow through dependable tools. We are extending that foundation to agents, giving them the support they need to transition from promising assistants to trustworthy collaborators.\nWhy trust matters more than speed\nTrust is not optional, and research supports this idea. A fin.ai study of customer service interactions showed that slower responses often felt more intelligent to users because they suggested greater effort.\nThis effect, called the “labor illusion”, demonstrates why speed alone does not create confidence. In software development, fast but shallow results typically need significant reworking and often provoke frustration.\nComplex tasks require deeper reasoning, which naturally takes more time. Developers understand that correctness is more valuable than immediacy. \nThis is why our AI Agents Research team created EnvBench and GitGoodBench to evaluate AI agents on software engineering tasks in Python, Java, Kotlin, and bash. By focusing on realistic workflows, these benchmarks reveal where current approaches fall short and where improvements are most needed to support developers. \nThis way, agents can first be made reliable and trustworthy. Only then does optimizing for speed translate to genuine progress as opposed to greater risk.\nBuild agents you can trust\nMany talk about the promise of agents, but little is said about their tangible benefits. Here at JetBrains, we are not just about following the latest trends; we want to build long-term trust. \n“Our philosophy is not just to build AI for the sake of building AI; we are not hype chasers. We have always been a private company, so we really depend on bringing true value to our developers”, says CEO Kirill Skrygan.\nAnd we’re applying this philosophy with Koog, our agentic framework for building AI agents in Kotlin. Koog provides the structure, memory, and orchestration that agents need to act reliably and ensure alignment with developer expectations. It manages workflows, tools, and context, enabling agents to integrate smoothly into projects and become dependable collaborators.\nPaired with the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, Koog extends beyond individual workflows. A2A standardizes communication, enabling agents to discover each other, exchange tasks, and collaborate across systems without custom integrations. Together, Koog and A2A make it possible to scale multi-agent systems that are both trustworthy and efficient. \nJetBrains is developing solutions that give agents a solid foundation, helping developers build greater trust in them. Enterprises are also a key focus for JetBrains, and we’ll explore that in the next article in this series.",

Over time, it evolved into Grazie Pro, adding style control, terminology rules, and multilingual support.\nNow, with the core proofreading technology fully integrated into the IDE, Grazie is no longer a separate external plugin but a built-in component.\nWhat’s changing for Grazie Pro users\nMost of Grazie Pro’s functionality now lives in the built-in Natural Languages plugin that ships with the IDE, with cloud checks being available in AI Assistant. The standalone Grazie Pro plugin will not be updated for IDE versions 2025.3 and later.\nA few Pro-only features aren’t yet available in the integrated version, including:\nPer-project style guides\nVanilla Vale support\nSyntax-aware selection\nPart-of-speech highlighting\nLocal machine learning error correction (MLEC)\nWe’re collecting feedback to decide which of these features to migrate, rework, or retire.\n? Vote for the features you’d like to see migrated\nWhy this change matters\nIntegrating Grazie natively allows us to:\nDeliver proofreading and writing assistance consistently across all JetBrains IDEs.\nShip improvements alongside IDE updates.\nReduce compatibility issues and plugin maintenance overhead.\nOur goal is to make natural language a first-class citizen in JetBrains IDEs, supporting not just correct English or German but also effective communication between developers and AI tools.\nWhat’s new in the built-in grammar and style checks\nThe built-in Natural Languages plugin combines Grazie’s proven proofreading with an extended set of capabilities:\nWriting domains – tailor the checks for different contexts like commit messages, prompting with AI, code comments, technical documentation, UI text, or general prose.\nGranular tone and style settings – adjust formality, clarity, and tone directly in your IDE.\nSmarter performance and detection – faster, lighter, and more consistent across editors.\nYou can use local proofreading out of the box, or switch to JetBrains AI Assistant for advanced cloud-based grammar and style checks, plus AI-powered rewrite, completion, and translation actions.\nSome cloud functionality – like Rephrase and more advanced proofreading – will also be available even without AI Assistant.\nNote: Accepting cloud-based grammar and style suggestions does not consume your AI quota.\nOther AI-powered actions, such as Rephrase or Translate, do use your AI quota, but typically at a much lower rate than code generation or refactoring. For approximate quota spending by different AI actions, see the AI Assistant usage guide.\n? Grazie – and grazie!\nBecause in any language, saying “thank you” never goes out of style.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains .NET Days Online 2025, Jason Taylor, Microsoft MVP and Solutions Architect at Particular Software, delivered an engaging presentation that transforms how we think about building distributed systems. Through live coding and interactive polls with the audience, Taylor demonstrated how .NET Aspire can turn what’s traditionally been a complex, friction-filled process into something surprisingly manageable.\nWhether you’re building your first distributed system or looking to modernize an existing one, Jason Taylor’s presentation offers both practical techniques and a refreshing perspective on how development tools should work. In short, they should make the complex feel effortless.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\nEffortless Distributed Systems With .NET Aspire – Jason Taylor, October 2025.\nThe philosophy of “effortless”\nJason Taylor opens with a crucial distinction that sets the tone for the entire presentation: \n“Effortless doesn’t mean no effort. It means reducing friction and spending effort in the right places.” \n(02:03)\nThis philosophy underpins everything that follows. .NET Aspire isn’t about eliminating work, but about eliminating the wrong kind of work.\nThe goal, as the speaker explains, is straightforward: “Shifting the focus back to what matters, right? Delivering features that users care about. We want to reduce wasted effort by eliminating manual setup, wiring, and boilerplate.”\nFrom zero to orchestrated in minutes\nStarting with a basic ASP.NET Core application that’s intentionally unreliable, Jason shows how adding .NET Aspire immediately transforms the development experience. With just a few clicks, the application gains automatic retry policies, service discovery, health checks, and comprehensive telemetry.\nThe transformation is dramatic: “When we added orchestration support to our application, we got lots of things for free. And one of those was HTTP client resilience, and it was using Polly to retry that request whenever it failed.” (10:16) No configuration files, no manual wiring – just instant resilience.\nThe developer experience revolution\nPerhaps the most compelling aspect of Jason’s demonstration is how Aspire transforms the local development experience. “The best part of course is our local development experience couldn’t be simpler or better. One press of F5 launches the entire system ready to test and observe instantly. (42:07)” \nBut this feature isn’t just about convenience for experienced developers, as Jason also emphasizes its utility when it comes to team onboarding: “That’s an excellent experience for a new developer who joins your team and is trying to get up and running. They press F5, then they start learning about the system.” Gone are the days of lengthy setup documentation and “but it works on my machine” problems.\nLive database migration without the pain\nIn one of the presentation’s interactive moments, Jason lets the audience vote on which database to use, and PostgreSQL wins over Azure SQL (14:27 ). What follows is a masterclass in how Aspire handles infrastructure changes. Within minutes, he swaps out SQLite for PostgreSQL, complete with Docker containerization, migrations, and service discovery.\nThe key insight: “No more juggling startup projects. With service defaults, we instantly get service discovery, health checks, resilience, and telemetry, all without manual setup.”\nMessaging made simple\nJason then tackles one of distributed systems’ thorniest challenges – reliable messaging (22:45). Using NServiceBus (from his employer, Particular Software), he demonstrates how Aspire’s abstraction model makes switching between message transports effortless. The audience votes for RabbitMQ over Azure Service Bus, and Jason seamlessly makes the switch with minimal code changes, all while maintaining the same local development experience.\nFrom local to cloud without the usual headaches\nThe presentation’s climax comes when Jason deploys the entire system to Azure (42:39). Using the Azure Developer CLI (azd) with Aspire’s deployment manifest, he sets up a complete CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps (another audience choice) in under five minutes.\n“With Aspire, our C# app model became the source of truth. We didn’t write any Bicep, ARM, or Terraform code. The deployment manifest describes our entire system and feeds directly into tools like AZD.” The entire infrastructure, including databases, message queues, and observability tools, is derived from the C# code that defines the application.\nThe bottom line\nJason Taylor’s closing advice distills the entire presentation into actionable wisdom: \n“Choose the right tools, remove the friction, and focus on what truly matters, delivering features that make an impact.”\nFollow Jason Taylor on X or visit his blog for more content on .NET, Azure, and distributed systems.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI With Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nComposing Distributed Applications With .NET Aspire – a presentation from .NET Days 2024 by Cecil Phillip that demonstrates .NET Aspire’s approach to building distributed apps.\n.NET Aspire and Dev Container – an article by Laurent Kempé showing how to work with .NET Aspire 9.1 inside a Dev Container using JetBrains Rider.\nSimplify Your .NET Development With Aspire – a step-by-step guide by Microsoft MVP Joseph Guadagno on adding .NET Aspire to an existing .NET 9 web app, including specific instructions for JetBrains Rider.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve ever tried to track down a bug in concurrent programs, you know how chaotic and frustrating it can be: everything seems to work fine, then suddenly crashes, and you can’t quite pin down why – all while the bugs slip through. \nTo bring order to this chaos, at JetBrains Research we built LitmusKt — a novel testing tool for Kotlin’s multiplatform concurrency. Designed specifically for Kotlin’s unique mix of JVM, Native, and JavaScript backends, LitmusKt helps developers uncover and eliminate subtle, platform-specific concurrency errors that traditional testing can’t catch.\nIn our previous post, we discussed a new approach to fuzzing the Kotlin compiler. Now we’re exploring how LitmusKt takes that work further – systematically revealing concurrency bugs hidden deep in the Kotlin runtime and compiler. In this post, we will:\nTalk about why concurrent programming is complex and why automated testing is particularly tricky.\nExplain how LitmusKt was needed for the Kotlin compiler and describe its cool technical features.\nLay out the history of LitmusKt, from its infancy as a research prototype, some of the bugs it found, and how it is now integrated into Kotlin/Native development.\nConcurrent programming\nWhen multiple tasks or computations are executed simultaneously rather than sequentially, the approach is called concurrent programming. Although it may sound like a simple concept, it can sometimes act erratically when implemented improperly. \nIf it is so tricky, why is concurrent programming even implemented? Well, many programming problems are naturally concurrent: there are numerous tasks and external events running at the same time. Consider also how modern hardware itself is inherently concurrent, as most CPUs have multiple cores. Without concurrent code, we would not be able to use the cores to their full potential.\nIn Per Brinch Hansen’s The Invention of Concurrent Programming (which covers the history of concurrent programming up to 2001), he tells a story where he and Peter Kraft needed to design a real-time system for a large chemical plant. For this, a computer would perform a fixed number of tasks simultaneously. The tasks’ speed could be manually adjusted by the plant operators, which means that there was no set speed. \nSo they were working with simultaneous tasks and needed some sort of process synchronization. Sequential, task-independent programming wasn’t going to cut it. If you want to know what happens next, you can find it in Part I of their book (spoiler: they implemented Edsger Dijkstra’s semaphores).\nConcurrent programming provides a number of advantages, including:\nImproved performance and throughput. More tasks are completed in a given timeframe. This is especially beneficial on multi-core processors, where different tasks can run on different cores.\nEfficient resource use, because system resources (like the CPU) can be used for other tasks while one task is waiting for input/output or another event. This reduces idle time and maximizes hardware efficiency.\nBetter responsiveness and user experience, because applications like web browsers, graphical user interfaces, and real-time systems remain responsive to input while other tasks run in the background. This supports smooth and uninterrupted user interactions.\nChallenges in concurrent programming\nWhen concurrent programming was first introduced in the 1960s, the operating systems running it were rather unstable. Challenges included the following:\nA small programming error could cause a lot of problems but be really difficult to test for and therefore fix.\nDeadlocks, or when all parts of a concurrent process are blocked, usually due to a lack of resources.\nConcurrent programming inherently involves simultaneously executed tasks. For this reason, challenges like the above arise because concurrent programming is highly dependent on unpredictable factors such as scheduling order or real-world timing. Let’s look at an example.\nConsider a program that initializes two shared variables, x and y, with 0, and starts two threads running in parallel. Each thread writes 1 to its associated variable. Then, each reads the other variable and stores that value as its result (r1 and r2, respectively, which are also initialized with 0).\n\nAt first glance, the outcomes for r1 and r2 seem limited and predictable. Either:\nOne thread finishes first, so it writes 1 to x, reads 0 from y, and the other reads the updated value 1, giving us straightforward outcomes of (0, 1) or (1, 0), depending on which thread finished first.\nOr both threads execute at the same time, so they both write 1, and both read 1, yielding another expected result: (1, 1).\nBut then, after running the program many times, a seemingly impossible outcome starts to appear: Each thread reads 0, even though both have written 1.\n\nThis sort of bizarre outcome is called weak behavior. It can happen for one of two reasons:\nCompiler optimizations, where compilers rearrange instructions or eliminate redundant memory operations to increase performance. This can result in subtle bugs, or even break the code, as dependencies may be lost in the shuffle.\nCPU buffering and reordering, where the hardware itself may buffer, delay, or reorder reads and writes to maximize efficiency. Modern CPUs have weak memory models that allow operations to happen in surprising sequences, invisible in regular single-threaded programs.\nWeak behaviors caused by the above are a central focus in analyzing and testing concurrent programs with specialized tools. If the programmer only looks at the code or thinks in terms of simple statement interleaving, these outcomes seem impossible. \nIn reality, compiler and CPU optimizations change the story, making concurrent programming far more elusive and unpredictable than it appears at first glance. This creates headaches for programmers and those designing programming languages. Because reasoning about these subtle interactions is so challenging, thorough testing is essential to ensure reliability.\nTesting concurrent programs\nConcurrent programming is difficult to test because nondeterministic thread interactions can produce subtle, non-reproducible failures. These are often called Heisenbugs, and they only appear under specific timings or schedules, making them inherently hard to find and troubleshoot. The same input can pass a test and then fail the very same test depending on subtle, uncontrollable sources of nondeterminism, and even the act of observing or debugging can mask or alter the bug’s behavior, contributing to flaky tests and prolonged debugging cycles.\nTraditional testing approaches struggle here because listing all possible thread schedules is infeasible in practice, and even systematic methods that control scheduling to capture nondeterminism are time-consuming and resource-intensive. This challenge is compounded by state space explosion, where the number of possible interleavings grows combinatorially with threads and synchronization points, necessitating reductions such as partial-order reduction and guided exploration to avoid redundant paths.\nFor testing these notoriously tricky programs, developers use a variety of strategies. Some common ones are listed in the table below.\n\n\n\n\nWhile code review and static analysis are both useful for early detection of concurrency bugs, they come with disadvantages as well. Namely, code review is susceptible to the reviewers’ errors and knowledge gaps; static analysis can generate false positives, thereby creating more work, and can miss runtime-only errors.\nRandom/fuzz/stress testing types are great for detecting rare or subtle bugs. They test programs under extreme conditions, for example with random inputs and under heavy load. These tests (especially stress testing) can also be useful to ensure smooth operation of a program in critical situations. These methods are usually resource-intensive, and they can sometimes produce false positives or miss more complex issues.\nMany strategies work well with business logic and modest concurrency patterns, but fall short with the subtle hardware or compiler optimizations that lead to “impossible” results, like the (0,0) outcome above. For example, stress testing or fuzzing may uncover these bugs eventually, but a specific type of tests called litmus tests is designed to systematically target these subtle behaviors and confirm theoretical predictions. This strategy is highly effective for environments with well-defined memory models, like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), or specific CPUs.\nFor the rest of this post, we will concentrate on litmus testing and then tell you about a specific litmus testing tool developed by JetBrains researchers.\nLitmus testing\nLitmus testing is like stress testing for concurrency: you write small concurrent programs (i.e., litmus tests) and run them thousands of times to catch rare, weird behaviors that only happen under specific timing conditions. Established tools like JCStress for Java and herdtools for assembly language have successfully found real bugs in production systems.\nJCStress, for instance, is used by OpenJDK developers to test the JVM, catching subtle race conditions and memory model violations that could cause catastrophic failures in production. herdtools goes even deeper, testing assembly-level programs against processor memory models to ensure hardware behaves as expected. While these tools are useful for the respective languages, they run into limitations with multi-platform languages like Kotlin.\nUnlike other languages, a key feature of Kotlin is that it compiles to JVM, Native, JavaScript, and WebAssembly, and each platform has its own distinct concurrency semantics and memory models. This diversity means some bugs cannot be caught with tools designed for just one backend – and so far existing tools hadn’t been able to handle this complexity. In other words, Kotlin needed its own litmus testing tool.\nWe took on the challenge of helping to discover bugs in the Kotlin compiler, and the result is a new tool that makes testing these tricky programs far easier. \nTesting concurrency programs with LitmusKt\nTo overcome the lack of a proper Kotlin testing tool for concurrency programming, we  at  JetBrains Research) decided to build our own solution, LitmusKt (see their recent paper). This section will tell you about its design and tech highlights, as well as its practical applications.\nLitmusKt’s design and cool technical features\nLitmusKt allows developers to write litmus tests once and run them across both Kotlin/JVM and Kotlin/Native platforms. The tool uses a custom domain-specific language that makes writing tests straightforward. A few examples of what LitmusKt does:\nDeclare shared states, such as shared variables, between threads.\nWrite thread behavior so that it’s clear what each thread should do.\nLabel expected outcomes as acceptable, interesting (i.e., noteworthy but allowed), or forbidden.\nBy using a custom DSL, developers can express thread interactions, shared variables, and outcome conditions flexibly, all within Kotlin. This lowers the barrier for writing complex concurrency tests.\nLet’s run through an example. Below you can find the code for the Store Buffering test, which is a standard litmus test (it’s also the program we saw in the example before). The test involves (i) defining a shared state, (ii) running code for several threads, and (iii) specifying  test outcomes; we will go through each one step by step.\nobject StoreBuffering {\n val Plain = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar x = 0\n\tvar y = 0\n    }\n}) {\n   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }\n   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }\n   spec {\n\taccept(r1:0, r2:1)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:0)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:1)\n\tinteresting(r1:0, r2:0)\n   }\n   reset { x = 0; y = 0 }\n}\nFirst, the test itself needs to be declared: we declare the state which will eventually be shared between the threads. In the example below, this comprises two int variables. \nobject StoreBuffering {\n val Plain = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar x = 0\n\tvar y = 0\n    }\nNext comes the code for each thread, shown below.\n}) {\n   thread { x = 1; r1 = y }\n   thread { y = 1; r2 = x }\nFinally, we must declare the outcomes and their labels. The possible outcomes are:\nAcceptable: sequentially consistent outcomes\nInteresting: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language\n spec {\n\taccept(r1:0, r2:1)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:0)\n\taccept(r1:1, r2:1)\n\tinteresting(r1:0, r2:0)\n   }\nIf you recall the example above, the result where r1 = 0 and r2 = 0 was unexpected, because it is weak behavior. In the code for the test, this result will be labelled as interesting, meaning it is acceptable but noteworthy. The other listed results are expected and therefore will be labelled as acceptable. \nLet’s look at what happens when we run the test with LitmusKt. How often do we see weak behavior in one million tests?\n\nThe above screenshot shows that interesting outcomes do occur, but that they are relatively rare, at less than five percent. To increase the frequency of finding these weak but tolerable outcomes, LitmusKt enables the user to apply different parameters to increase the number of complex interactions (see the paper for further details).\nNow that we know how to write a test in LitmusKt, let’s look at the more technical details. Our team built a custom Kotlin/Native test runner from scratch because no solutions existed up until then. The test runner is built on techniques from other litmus testing tools, such as careful thread synchronization and CPU affinity control. We created a test runner so that the threads modify different states simultaneously many times over, significantly increasing the likelihood that a concurrent interaction occurs and weak behavior can be detected.\nFor Kotlin/JVM, we integrated the tool with the existing JCStress framework, as it is known to be successful in uncovering concurrency bugs in various JVM implementations. Despite some integration challenges, the end interface is seamless for the user.\nTo summarize, LitmusKt incorporates proven methods to maximize the frequency of rare behaviors and provides powerful reporting tools for manual and automated analysis. Users can also interact via a rich command-line interface, adjusting test parameters, durations, and system settings.\nConsidering all these features, has LitmusKt caught any Kotlin bugs? As we will see in the next section, it has. \nLitmusKt and real code\nWe applied LitmusKt and several litmus tests to analyze the behavior of Kotlin programs, therefore testing the results of the Kotlin compiler and looking for previously unknown issues. The possible outcomes here are:\nAcceptable: sequentially consistent outcomes\nInteresting: weak but tolerable outcomes according to the semantics of the programming language\nForbidden: weak intolerable outcomes, indicating bugs\nIn contrast to the Store Buffering Test above, this analysis includes two weak outcomes: one tolerable and one intolerable, where the latter outcome represents a bug. The testing results are shown in the following image, where ACC, INT, and FORB stand for acceptable, interesting, and forbidden. \n\nWe can see that there are a number of tests uncovering interesting results, and one test in particular with forbidden results. The test abbreviated as UPUB in the table is unsafe publication. The forbidden results represent a situation where objects could be accessed before proper initialization, potentially causing rare and critical failures in production environments. The fact that memory-unsafe behavior could slip through in a memory-safe language like Kotlin demonstrates why systematic concurrency testing is essential. \nLet’s look more closely at unsafe publication, shown in the code below, and what unexpected outcomes arose.\nclass IntHolder(val x: Int = 0)\n val UnsafePublication = litmusTest({\n    object : LitmusIIOutcome() {\n\tvar h : IntHolder? = null\n    }\n}) {\n   thread { h = IntHolder() }\n   thread { r1 = h?.x ?: -1 }\n   spec { accept(0); accept(-1) }\n   reset { h = null }\n}\nIn the code above, we can see a simple class IntHolder with a single integer. The shared state is a reference to this class. Then, we have two threads: one which is going to create a new class, and one which will try to read its variable.\nThe outcome of running the unsafe publication test was expected to be one of two scenarios: \nThe class IntHolder is initialized —> 0\nThe class IntHolder is not initialized —> -1\nThe actual outcome of running the unsafe publication test with Kotlin 1.9 is shown in the following image. Any result which is not declared as interesting or acceptable is considered forbidden.\n\nUnexpectedly, garbage values could be read from uninitialized memory. A memory-safe language like Kotlin definitely should not let this happen. In other words, our team found a new compiler bug thanks to LitmusKt. Since identifying the bug, our team has already fixed and merged it. As of Kotlin 1.9.20 and later, this bug no longer occurs. \nWe found further issues while running unsafe publication with LitmusKt (see the paper for more details). As these are valuable insights for the Kotlin compiler, and after discussion with the Kotlin/Native development team, LitmusKt is now embedded in the Kotlin CI/CD pipeline.\nIn addition to the issues arising from running different tests, we discovered more noteworthy outcomes. The below image contains the partial code of a standard litmus test and the resulting outcomes.\n\nAs can be seen in the above image, the test produces only three outcomes. So far, nothing crazy. The interesting bit happens when the code is slightly altered with semantically equivalent changes. That is, these changes theoretically should not result in any additional thread interactions. However, as the below image shows, another outcome actually does show up.\n\nThis extra outcome, marked in pink in the above image, is actually a weak outcome, as it cannot be achieved by interleaving execution of threads. We suspect that such behavior is caused by compiler optimizations. In the future, it might be worthwhile to combine compiler fuzzing (i.e., with random code mutations) with litmus testing to discover more edge cases.\nBringing order to Kotlin concurrency\nLitmusKt proves that even in the mayhem of concurrent programming, order can be found. By catching bugs that once slipped through the cracks of the Kotlin compiler, it has made multiplatform Kotlin development more reliable than ever.\nWith LitmusKt now part of Kotlin’s CI pipeline, every new compiler version benefits from systematic concurrency testing – ensuring that subtle memory model violations are caught before they reach developers.\nWe didn’t just build a tool; we established a new way to think about concurrency testing for multiplatform languages.\nIn short, LitmusKt:\nBrings automated, multiplatform litmus testing to Kotlin for the first time.\nUncovered and helped fix multiple concurrency bugs in Kotlin/Native.\nOpened new possibilities for hybrid testing approaches that combine compiler fuzzing with concurrency analysis.\nLitmusKt is open-source and ready to help you explore, understand, and test the complex behaviors of concurrent programs across Kotlin’s many platforms.\nTry LitmusKt on GitHub\n                                    \nFurther reading\nCurious to explore the research or try out litmus testing on your own code?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In today’s software development landscape, AI coding agents are evolving rapidly from prototypes into indispensable tools. Yet the industry still lacks an open, neutral, standards-based way to measure the real-world effectiveness of these agents across languages, frameworks, and environments.\nWith over two decades of experience building developer tools that are trusted by millions worldwide, we bring deep expertise in both tooling and developer workflows. This is why we are launching the Developer Productivity AI Arena (DPAI Arena). \nDPAI Arena is an open benchmarking platform for evaluating AI-assisted developer productivity tools through multi-language, multi-framework, and multi-workflow benchmarks, and we intend to contribute it to the Linux Foundation.\nWhy a new platform is needed\nThe rise of AI-assisted coding has outpaced our ability to measure it meaningfully. While current popular OSS-based benchmarks were an important early step, these have several well-known limitations:\nOutdated datasets: The underlying data for the open benchmarks does not reflect modern development workflows.\nPatch-only focus: They test only a single workflow (issue → patch), without evaluating PR reviews, coverage goals, or compliance.\nNo evaluation of modern agents: They benchmark LLMs, not coding agents. Numerous features and optimization possibilities specific to coding agents are not considered by LLM benchmarks.\nHard to reproduce: Their complex setup and limited transparency make consistent comparisons difficult.\nIn short, benchmarks from 2023 cannot measure 2025 workflows. AI development has evolved, and our benchmarks must evolve with it.\nWhat makes DPAI Arena unique?\nDPAI Arena is an open benchmark platform, which was designed by JetBrains and with an intent to contribute to the Linux Foundation. It was created to measure AI-assisted developer productivity across multiple languages, frameworks, and workflow types.\nUnlike single-dataset benchmarks, DPAI Arena introduces a multi-track architecture – a flexible framework where different communities and vendors can contribute datasets for specific types of software development workflows.\nIn addition to all that, DPAI Arena represents a new standard for infrastructure configuration, ensuring a consolidated, reproducible, and scalable benchmarking experience. We plan to release a CLI that will allow these benchmarks to be integrated into any of the existing CI pipelines. Currently, we are running this on TeamCity as part of the MVP. But with the release of the CLI, this can easily be ported to GitHub Actions or any other CI infrastructure.\nTrack-based framework: Measuring what developers actually do\nTraditional benchmarks evaluate only one workflow: issue → patch. DPAI Arena extends this model through a multi-track architecture that mirrors real-world engineering activities:\nIssue → patch track: Exists as the foundational track for fixing bugs and implementing feature requests.\nPR review track: Evaluates agents’ ability to analyze and improve pull requests.\nCoverage track: Measures how well agents can write or expand unit tests to increase code coverage.\nStatic analysis track: Focuses on identifying and fixing linting or static analysis issues.\nUpgrade track: Tests an agent’s capability to perform dependency or framework upgrades safely.\nCompliance track: Evaluates adherence to organizational or industry coding standards.\nEach track represents a distinct, real-world workflow. Technology vendors can contribute datasets for tracks that are most relevant to their ecosystem, enabling comprehensive evaluation across the full software development lifecycle.\nAdditional tracks may include areas such as architecture refactoring, documentation generation, or performance optimization.\nThis multi-track approach is what differentiates DPAI Arena from single-workflow academic benchmarks. It reflects the true diversity of modern software engineering.\nThe first benchmark: Java + Spring\nThe first benchmark targets applications built using the Spring framework. This benchmark contains 15 open-source Spring-based projects covering a variety of architectures – from microservices to modular monoliths, to capture the diversity of real-world enterprise development. It contains a set of 140+ tasks mirroring realistic enterprise-grade requirements spread through a typical SDLC. \nThe Spring AI Community plans to contribute spring-ai-bench built on top of the spring-ai-agents framework to the DPAI Arena. It leverages Spring-based workloads and provides a reference implementation for how technology communities can design and contribute tracks within DPAI Arena. It also provides an abstraction layer that allows to talk to multiple coding agents.\nCurrently, DPAI Arena evaluation is built using deterministic tests evaluation, based on pass/fail metrics. We plan to migrate to the quality-based evaluation through an LLM-powered judge framework. Rather than focusing solely on pass/fail metrics, judges assess whether agents follow framework-specific best practices and produce maintainable code. For example, two agents might both achieve 70% coverage, but only one follows Spring’s recommended testing patterns. This qualitative dimension ensures the benchmark rewards developer-aligned quality rather than mere task completion.\nTogether, the multi-track design, coding agent abstraction, and judge-based evaluation will make DPAI Arena the most flexible and realistic platform yet for measuring AI-assisted developer productivity.\nCore principles\nDPAI Arena’s design is grounded in principles of trust, openness, and extensibility:\nTrusted and transparent: Evaluation pipelines, scoring rules, and infrastructure are open, reproducible, and verifiable.\nMulti-track and realistic: Benchmarks reflect real developer workflows, not just patch generation.\nExtensible and inclusive: Any community or vendor can contribute datasets, tracks, and evaluation rules.\nNeutral and vendor-independent: DPAI Arena will be governed by the Linux Foundation to ensure long-term neutrality and collaboration.\nA platform built for many languages and frameworks\nThe first benchmark focuses on the Spring ecosystem, but the platform is inherently framework and language-agnostic. \nThis is where collaboration becomes vital: No single team or company can cover every technology, framework, and workload alone. Therefore, building an open platform is the only way to combine domain experience and expertise from a broad variety of industrial experts. New tracks can easily be added for Quarkus, Grails, or Helidon, and the platform can be extended to other languages such as Python, PHP, Go, and JavaScript.\nOver time, DPAI Arena will evolve into a cross-language and cross-workflow foundation for measuring real-world developer productivity in the age of AI.\nCommunity and collaboration\nDPAI Arena is a community-driven initiative, not a proprietary benchmark. Developed by JetBrains and with an intent to contribute to the Linux Foundation, it ensures open governance and shared ownership.\nEvery participant can play a role:\nCoding agent providers can evaluate their agents across standardized tracks and publish comparable results.\nTechnology vendors can contribute domain-specific datasets and benchmarks.\nEnd Users can validate and use existing benchmarks from technology vendors or bring their own datasets to run on the decoupled on-premises infrastructure.\nTogether, this creates a shared, trusted scoreboard for AI coding agents that promotes transparency and accelerates innovation.\nGet involved\nDeveloper Productivity AI Arena is more than a benchmark; it is a platform for collaboration. We intend to contribute this project to the Linux Foundation. We plan to create an open Technical Steering Committee to determine the platform’s future direction. Please reach out to us at join@dpaia.dev if you would like to be part of the committee.\nIf you build coding agents, maintain frameworks, or rely on AI-assisted development tools, join the DPAI Arena project. Contribute your tracks, evaluate your agents, and help build a transparent, open foundation for measuring AI-driven developer productivity across languages, workflows, and organizations.\nFollow all progress, releases, and discussions on https://dpaia.dev/, and explore the source code, specifications, and contribution guides in the https://github.com/dpaia.\nLet’s measure the real-world impact of AI in software development, together!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The October 2025 update for Visual Studio 2022 (v17.14) is now available. In this month, we are bringing you improvements to model choices, agentic flows, and chat thread management. \n\n \nNew Models \nWe now have Claude Sonnet 4.5  and Claude Haiku 4.5 available in the chat window. This means the latest innovations for driving your agentic workflows is right at your fingertips. \nMemories \n\nFor Copilot to work effectively for your unique team and repository, it needs to learn about your project and team best practices. Copilot memories enable Copilot to understand and apply your project’s specific coding standards, making it project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nHow Copilot memories work \nMemories use intelligent detection to understand your team’s preferences as you prompt in the chat. That means, as you prompt how you normally would, Copilot is looking for instances where you correct its behavior, explicitly indicate a standard, or ask it to remember something. When detected, you’ll see a confirmation nudge to save the preference. Copilot will then categorize the preference into one of three files: \n.editorconfig for coding standards \nCONTRIBUTING.md for best practices, guidelines, architectural standards, etc. \nand README.md for high level project information \nSo, as you prompt, you’re not only teaching Copilot how to respond better to you in the future, but you’re also helping out your team by documenting your development best practices, and augmenting their future Copilot responses as well! \nPlanning \ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/Planning-quick-quick-1.mp4\n\nCopilot Chat now includes built-in planning to help guide large, multi-step tasks.  \nWhen you ask a complex question, Copilot automatically creates a markdown plan file with: \nA task list  \nThe files it plans to edit  \nContext for its approach \nAs it works, Copilot updates the plan in real time – tracking progress, adapting to blockers, and keeping its logic transparent. \nPlanning is fully visible, scoped to your goal, and implemented through tool calling, making behavior more predictable, reliable, and easy to follow. \nTry it out: Ask Copilot to refactor a component, add a new feature, or fix bugs across multiple files. \n Plan files are temporary by default. To reuse or share them across threads, save the file into your repo. \nTo learn more about planning or share your feedback, check out the blog post. \nInstruction Files \n\nGetting Copilot to respond the way you want can be a challenge. You may have different coding standards, best practices, or architectural patterns in different areas of your codebase. With instruction files, you can now target specific instructions to specific folders or files in your repository, making Copilot truly project-aware and consistent across sessions. \nEnable the feature \nTurn on the feature at Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Chat > Enable custom instructions to be loaded from .github/instructions/*.instructions.md files and added to requests. \nWrite instruction files \nFormat your instructions with the applyTo header and specify a glob pattern for which files you want these instructions to be included for. \n--- \n \napplyTo: \"src/**/*.cs\" \n \n---\nIn the file body, you can use natural language to specify your content and reference other instruction files to compose instructions together.  \nSave the file with the .instructions.md file extension in the root of your repository in the .github/instructions folder. \nTip: You can even get Copilot’s help refining your instructions to be more detailed. \nHow it works \nWhen you prompt Copilot, it will automatically detect which instruction files apply to the files in your current context and attach them as references. You can see which instructions were attached by clicking on the references in the response card. \nBring Your Own Model with Azure Foundry\nWant the ultimate layer of control over which models you’re using in GitHub Copilot Chat? Try out the new Azure Foundry integration to bring your own models.\nChat Management \nWe’ve got two new commands available for managing your chat threads, /clear and /clearAll.  \n/clear – Use this when you’ve encountered any issues with your current chat conversation and would like to easily start fresh. \n/clearAll – Use this when you’ve got a ton of old threads hanging around that you don’t need any more, and it will clear all of them from your history – making it easier to find what you’re looking for next time. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub \nStay connected with everything in Visual Studio in one place! Visit the Visual Studio Hub for the latest release notes, YouTube videos, social updates, and community discussions. \nAppreciation for your feedback \nYour feedback helps us improve Visual Studio, making it an even more powerful tool for developers. We are immensely grateful for your contributions and look forward to your continued support. By sharing your thoughts, ideas, and any issues you encounter through Developer Community, you help us improve and shape the future of Visual Studio.\nThe post Visual Studio October Update – new models, memories, planning, and more appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이 점을 정확히 꿰뚫고 있었어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">레시피 카드 우측 상단의 작은 카메라 아이콘을 한번 눌러보세요. 그러면 Google의 최첨단 이미지 생성 모델인 <b>Imagen</b>이 마법을 부리기 시작합니다. 레시피의 이름과 상세한 설명을 바탕으로, 마치 전문 푸드 포토그래퍼가 갓 촬영한 듯한 먹음직스러운 완성 요리 이미지를 그 자리에서 바로 생성해 줍니다. 정말 감탄이 나오지 않을 수 없죠. 이건 그냥 보기 좋은 것을 넘어, 요리에 대한 영감을 제대로 불어넣어 주고, 어떤 그릇에 어떻게 담아야 할지 플레이팅 아이디어까지 제공해서 요리의 즐거움을 한층 더 끌어올려 줍니다. 제 생각엔 이 기능 하나만으로도 이 앱을 써볼 가치가 충분하다고 느껴졌어요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1a73e8; font-size: 19px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">③ 나만의 맞춤형 셰프, 이제 당신의 취향을 말해보세요</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI는 식별된 재료를 가장 효율적이고 맛있게 사용할 수 있는 레시피를 먼저 똑똑하게 추천합니다. 그런데 여기서 끝이 아니에요. 이건 정말 '개인 맞춤형 셰프'가 아닐까 싶을 정도로 디테일한 설정이 가능해요. 사용자는 '한식', '이탈리안', '퓨전' 등 원하는 요리 스타일을 선택할 수 있고요, 심지어 '채식', '글루텐 프리', '저탄수화물' 같은 특정 식단 필터를 적용해서 수많은 레시피 중에서 내 상황과 입맛에 정말 꼭! 맞는 '오늘의 메뉴'를 발견할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">냉장고 한 켠에서 잊고 있던 자투리 재료들 있잖아요? 이걸 어떻게 활용해야 할지 몰라 버리곤 했는데, 이제 AI가 그걸 기가 막히게 조합해서 창의적인 방법들을 제안해 줍니다. 아, 생각만 해도 뭔가 뿌듯하고 재미있지 않나요? 이건 요리 이상의 경험을 제공해 주는 것 같아요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"color: #1a73e8; font-size: 19px; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">④ 요리의 흐름을 돕는 스마트 기능들: 양손은 자유롭게, 장보기는 스마트하게</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">요리하다 보면 양념 묻은 손으로 스마트폰 화면을 터치하느라 고생했던 경험, 다들 있으시죠? 저도 손에 밀가루 범벅인 채로 레시피 다음 단계를 넘기려다 포기한 적이 한두 번이 아니에요. '냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이런 사소하지만 불편했던 점까지 세심하게 배려했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">스피커 아이콘만 클릭하면 작동하는 <b>단계별 음성 안내(TTS)</b> 기능 덕분에, 이제 두 손을 자유롭게 요리에만 집중할 수 있어요.

        "contentSnippet": "매일 뭐 먹을지 고민하는 당신에게, 이제 냉장고 문만 열면 AI 셰프가 최고의 레시피를 제안합니다. Google AI Gemini와 Imagen이 탄생시킨 '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱으로 음식물 쓰레기는 줄이고, 요리의 즐거움은 키워보세요. 당신의 주방이 완전히 새로워집니다.\n\n\n매일 아침, 점심, 저녁. \"오늘 뭐 먹지?\"라는 질문은 우리 삶에서 영원히 끝나지 않을 숙제 같지 않나요? 냉장고 문을 열고 가득한 재료들을 보지만, 정작 뭘 해 먹어야 할지 막막했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 거예요. 결국 배달 앱을 켜면서 '아, 저 재료들 다 어떻게 하지…' 하고 죄책감을 느꼈던 순간들도 많았죠. 이런 우리 모두의 오래된 고민을 시원하게 해결해 줄 아주 특별한 주방 동반자가 드디어 세상에 나왔습니다. 바로 냉장고 사진 한 장으로 잠자고 있던 식재료에 새로운 생명을 불어넣어 주는 AI 요리 비서, '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱입니다.\n솔직히 말하면, 처음 이 아이디어가 생각났을때 '진짜 가능할까?' 하고 반신반의했어요. 하지만 Google의 개발자 지원 프로그램인 'Build with Google AI (바이브코딩)'를 통해 이 놀라운 아이디어가 현실이 되었답니다. 개발자들은 Google AI Studio라는 정말 강력한 웹 기반 도구를 활용해서, 최첨단 AI 모델인 Gemini와 Imagen을 손쉽게 테스트하고 앱에 빠르게 통합할 수 있었죠. 덕분에 복잡하고 어려운 AI 기술이 이제 우리 주방 안으로 쏙 들어와서, 요리 경험 자체를 완전히 바꿔놓을 준비를 마쳤습니다. 2025년, 이제 '오늘 뭐 먹지?' 고민은 이 앱에게 맡겨도 될 것 같아요.\n오늘은 이 혁신적인 앱이 어떻게 우리의 식생활을 혁신하는지, 그 심층적인 기능과 사용법을 저와 함께 자세히 파헤쳐 볼까 합니다. 기대되지 않으세요?\n  '냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 핵심 기능 Deep Dive\n이 앱이 시중에 나와 있는 수많은 레시피 앱들과 차원이 다르다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있는 이유는 바로 AI 기술이 접목된 네 가지 강력한 차별점 때문입니다. 단순히 레시피를 찾아주는 것을 넘어, 요리의 전 과정을 스마트하게 도와주는 진정한 파트너라고 할 수 있죠.\n\n\n① 눈으로 보고 '이해'하는 AI, Gemini\n'냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 가장 핵심적인 강점은 단연 Google의 막강한 멀티모달 AI, Gemini에 있습니다. 사용자가 냉장고 사진을 업로드하면, Gemini는 단순하게 이미지 속에서 형태만 인식하는 것을 넘어, 사진 속 식재료 하나하나를 마치 사람처럼 '이해'하기 시작합니다. 음… 예를 들면, 어지럽게 놓인 채소 더미, 누가 봐도 반쯤 사용한 소스병, 심지어 우유팩의 브랜드까지 식별해서 정확한 재료 목록을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 만들어내죠.\n제가 직접 테스트해 봤는데, 정말 놀랍더군요. 단순히 '채소'라고 인식하는 게 아니라 '시들기 시작한 상추', '반 개 남은 양파' 이런 식으로 상태까지 추론하더라고요! 이게 단순히 재료를 나열하는 것을 넘어서, 각 재료의 신선도나 현재 상태까지 고려해서 가장 최적의, 그리고 창의적인 레시피를 제안하는 기반이 됩니다. 이 부분이 정말 중요한데, 음식물 쓰레기를 줄이는 데 크게 기여할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요.\n② 상상력을 현실로, Imagen으로 보는 완성 요리\n\"이 레시피, 과연 맛있어 보일까?\" 요리 초보자든 베테랑이든, 이 질문은 요리에 대한 동기를 부여하는 아주 중요한 요소일 겁니다. 솔직히 글로만 된 레시피로는 감이 잘 안 올 때가 많잖아요? '냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이 점을 정확히 꿰뚫고 있었어요.\n레시피 카드 우측 상단의 작은 카메라 아이콘을 한번 눌러보세요. 그러면 Google의 최첨단 이미지 생성 모델인 Imagen이 마법을 부리기 시작합니다. 레시피의 이름과 상세한 설명을 바탕으로, 마치 전문 푸드 포토그래퍼가 갓 촬영한 듯한 먹음직스러운 완성 요리 이미지를 그 자리에서 바로 생성해 줍니다. 정말 감탄이 나오지 않을 수 없죠. 이건 그냥 보기 좋은 것을 넘어, 요리에 대한 영감을 제대로 불어넣어 주고, 어떤 그릇에 어떻게 담아야 할지 플레이팅 아이디어까지 제공해서 요리의 즐거움을 한층 더 끌어올려 줍니다. 제 생각엔 이 기능 하나만으로도 이 앱을 써볼 가치가 충분하다고 느껴졌어요.\n③ 나만의 맞춤형 셰프, 이제 당신의 취향을 말해보세요\nAI는 식별된 재료를 가장 효율적이고 맛있게 사용할 수 있는 레시피를 먼저 똑똑하게 추천합니다. 그런데 여기서 끝이 아니에요. 이건 정말 '개인 맞춤형 셰프'가 아닐까 싶을 정도로 디테일한 설정이 가능해요. 사용자는 '한식', '이탈리안', '퓨전' 등 원하는 요리 스타일을 선택할 수 있고요, 심지어 '채식', '글루텐 프리', '저탄수화물' 같은 특정 식단 필터를 적용해서 수많은 레시피 중에서 내 상황과 입맛에 정말 꼭! 맞는 '오늘의 메뉴'를 발견할 수 있습니다.\n냉장고 한 켠에서 잊고 있던 자투리 재료들 있잖아요? 이걸 어떻게 활용해야 할지 몰라 버리곤 했는데, 이제 AI가 그걸 기가 막히게 조합해서 창의적인 방법들을 제안해 줍니다. 아, 생각만 해도 뭔가 뿌듯하고 재미있지 않나요? 이건 요리 이상의 경험을 제공해 주는 것 같아요.\n④ 요리의 흐름을 돕는 스마트 기능들: 양손은 자유롭게, 장보기는 스마트하게\n요리하다 보면 양념 묻은 손으로 스마트폰 화면을 터치하느라 고생했던 경험, 다들 있으시죠? 저도 손에 밀가루 범벅인 채로 레시피 다음 단계를 넘기려다 포기한 적이 한두 번이 아니에요. '냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이런 사소하지만 불편했던 점까지 세심하게 배려했습니다.\n스피커 아이콘만 클릭하면 작동하는 단계별 음성 안내(TTS) 기능 덕분에, 이제 두 손을 자유롭게 요리에만 집중할 수 있어요. AI가 친절하게 다음 단계를 차근차근 읽어주니, 정말 편리하더라고요. 마치 옆에 요리 선생님이 서 있는 듯한 느낌을 받았답니다.\n게다가 레시피를 확인하다가 '아, 이 재료가 없네!' 하고 깨달았을 때가 있어요. 이때 앱이 이를 놓치지 않고 자동으로 감지해서 스마트 쇼핑 목록에 추가할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 더 이상 장을 보러 가서 필요한 재료를 깜빡하고 다시 돌아오는 불상사는 없을 겁니다. 저처럼 건망증 심한 사람에게는 정말 구세주 같은 기능이었어요!\n  '냉장고 속을 부탁해' A to Z 사용 가이드\n이렇게 혁신적인 앱이라면 사용법이 어렵지 않을까 걱정하실 수도 있겠지만, 놀라울 정도로 직관적이고 간단합니다. 제가 직접 사용해 본 경험을 바탕으로, 여러분도 쉽게 따라 할 수 있도록 상세하게 알려드릴게요.\n\n\n\n \n[1단계] 냉장고 문을 열고, 찰칵!  \n앱의 메인 화면에서 이미지 업로드 영역을 터치하여 냉장고 내부가 선명하게 보이는 사진을 찍거나 앨범에서 선택합니다. 팁을 드리자면, 사진이 선명하고 냉장고 속 재료들이 잘 보일수록 AI가 재료를 훨씬 더 정확하게 인식하니까, 조금만 신경 써서 찍어주세요!\n[2단계] AI의 마법을 기다리세요 ✨\n업로드가 완료되면, 잠시만 기다려주세요.

AI는 우리가 던지는 질문에 따라 무한한 잠재력을 보여주니까요. 마치 요리할 때 레시피를 기본으로 나만의 재료를 추가하는 것과 비슷하다고 생각하시면 돼요.\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 프롬프트를 복사한 뒤, [ ] 안의 내용을 본인의 상황에 맞게 꼭 수정하는 과정을 잊지 마세요. 이 단계가 AI의 잠재력을 최대로 끌어내고, 만족스러운 결과를 얻는 핵심 열쇠입니다. 복사-붙여넣기만으로는 100%의 효과를 보기 어렵습니다.\n✨ 이런 분들에게 'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'를 강력 추천합니다!\n'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 정말 다양한 분야의 사람들에게 큰 도움이 될 수 있는 도구라고 생각합니다. 특히 다음과 같은 분들이라면, 이 플랫폼을 통해 업무 효율과 생산성을 2배 이상 끌어올릴 수 있을 거예요.\nAI 마케터: 바이럴 캠페인 아이디어나 광고 카피 문구, SEO 전략 수립이 막막할 때. 혹은 고객 세분화 분석 등 복잡한 마케팅 전략을 세울 때도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n개발자 & 기획자: 코드 리팩토링, API 설계 초안, 단위 테스트 케이스 생성, 아니면 복잡한 기능 요구사항을 명확하게 정리하고 싶을 때. 개발 과정의 막힌 부분을 시원하게 뚫어줄 겁니다.\n콘텐츠 크리에이터: 유튜브 스크립트 초안, 블로그 글 구성, 소설 아이디어, 심지어는 SNS 게시물 문구까지! 영감이 필요할 때마다 이 플랫폼이 든든한 조력자가 되어줄 거예요.\n학생 & 연구원: 복잡한 개념을 쉽게 이해하고 싶거나, 에세이 개요를 잡고, 논문 초록을 작성해야 할 때. 방대한 자료를 요약하는 데도 탁월한 성능을 발휘합니다.\n모든 직장인: 회의록 요약, 보고서 초안 작성, 이메일 작성, 발표 자료 구성 등 일상적인 업무를 더 빠르고 효율적으로 처리하고 싶을 때. 야근이 줄어드는 마법을 경험하실지도 모릅니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1.

[ ]로 표시된 부분을 여러분의 실제 정보로 수정하면, AI가 훨씬 더 정확하고 만족스러운, 그리고 무엇보다 '나만을 위한' 결과물을 제공하게 됩니다. 이 과정을 통해 여러분의 창의력과 AI의 능력이 결합되어 시너지를 낼 수 있죠.\n { \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"FAQPage\", \"mainEntity\": [ { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"'GPT PARK's Prompt Hub'는 무료로 이용할 수 있나요?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"네, 대부분의 '분야별 프롬프트'는 누구나 무료로 이용할 수 있도록 제공됩니다. 하지만 '챗봇 지침(Gems & GPTs)'과 같이 특정 전문가용 고급 기능들은 채널 멤버십 회원 전용으로 운영되며, 암호를 통해 접근할 수 있습니다.\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"어떤 AI 챗봇과 함께 사용하는 것이 좋은가요?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Copilot 등 텍스트 기반의 거의 모든 AI 챗봇에서 활용할 수 있습니다. 프롬프트를 복사해서 여러분이 주로 사용하는 AI 챗봇에 붙여넣기만 하면 되니, 호환성에 대한 걱정은 전혀 하지 않으셔도 됩니다. 저도 여러 AI 챗봇에서 시도해봤는데 다 잘 작동하더라고요!\" } }, { \"@type\": \"Question\", \"name\": \"프롬프트를 직접 수정하는 과정이 왜 중요한가요?\", \"acceptedAnswer\": { \"@type\": \"Answer\", \"text\": \"'프롬프트 허브'의 프롬프트들은 기본적으로 훌륭한 '템플릿' 역할을 합니다. 하지만 AI의 가장 큰 장점은 여러분의 특정 상황과 요구사항에 맞춰 맞춤형 결과물을 생성할 수 있다는 점이에요.

ISA 계좌나 연금 계좌에서도 투자할 수 있는 국내 투자운용사의 금현물 ETF 등은 투자가 쉬우면서 인플레이션 방어 역할을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n(3) 대출금 상환 우선순위 설정하기\n금리가 내려가면 대출 이자가 줄어들어 숨통이 트일 수 있지만, 부채가 많다면 우선 갚는 게 최선입니다. 특히 금리가 높은 신용대출 상환은 최우선순위로 둬야 하고요. 금리가 오를 때는 변동금리 대출의 부담이 커지므로, 저금리 시기에 미리 갚거나 고정금리로 바꿔두는 게 안전합니다. 매달 일정 비율을 정해 꾸준히 상환하고, 보너스나 여윳돈이 생기면 추가로 갚아나가면 부채 관리가 조금 더 수월해질 수 있어요.\n물가와 금리는 서로 맞물리며 경제의 큰 균형을 만들어 갑니다. 금리가 오르고 내리는 과정은 결국 과열을 식히고, 또 침체를 막으며 경제가 스스로 균형을 찾아가는 흐름이 반복되는 거예요. 그 안에서 우리는 때론 불안에 떨고, 때론 기회를 기대하기도 합니다. 투자자로서 이 파도 같은 변동성에 휩쓸리지 않으려면 길게 보는 안목과 인내심을 가져야 합니다. 그리고 자산을 분산 투자하고, 주기적인 리밸런싱을 통해 포트폴리오를 점검하며 시장의 흐름에 유연하게 대응하는 게 중요합니다. 이렇게 하면 금리와 물가의 파동 속에서도 자산을 지켜내고 성장시킬 수 있습니다.\n경제는 늘 변하지만, 물가와 금리가 가리키는 신호를 이해하면 변동성은 두려움의 대상이 아니라 기회의 신호입니다. 우리가 경제를 공부하는 건 이 거대한 흐름 속에서 흔들리지 않고 내 자산을 지키기 위한 것이라는 점을 기억하세요.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호, 이제현",

(대표적인 예: 유기농 레몬즙, 리들샷, 니트 원피스 등…)\nSNS로 타인의 삶을 실시간으로 빠르게 스캔할 수 있는 요즘, 따라하고 싶은 멋진 취향은 도처에 널려 있다. 그만큼 디토 소비의 규모는 갈수록 더 크고 다양해지는 추세다. 100만 유튜버가 추천한 맛집, 유명 연예인이 감명 깊게 읽은 책, 헐리웃 스타가 자주 쓰는 텀블러 등은 소문이 나는 순간 오픈런 필수·베스트셀러·품절템이 되는 세상이다.\n독일 베를린에 갔을 때는 말차라떼가 한창 유행이었다. 인플루언서들의 후기를 타고 전 세계에 말차 열풍이 불고 있다는 소리는 얼핏 들었는데, 베를린 카페에서 젊은 여성들이 들고 있는 음료 대부분이 정말 말차라떼였던 것이다. 괜히 나도 평소 한국에선 잘 안 마시지도 않던 말차라떼를 두어 번 주문해 봤다. 맛은 예상한 그대로였지만 내게 중요한 건 ‘나도 그들처럼 해봤다’는 경험이었다.\n\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}인스타그램에서 본 베를린 필하모닉 공연을 보러 가 샴페인을 마시고, 유행한다는 말차라떼를 마시며 민음사TV가 추천한 책을 읽고, 챗GPT가 추천한 ‘여기서 꼭 사야 하는 기념품’을 사는 동안 내가 쌓은 취향의 탑은 무슨 모양일까.\n’나도 할래’가 취향이 되는 순간\n디토 소비는 이렇듯 타인의 취향을 사는 행위다. 작년 초쯤 팔로워 10만 명 이하인 마이크로 인플루언서 시장에 대해 취재한 적이 있다. 그때 들은 이야기 하나가 떠오른다. 과거 SNS 사용자들이 특정 계정을 팔로우하는 기준은 대체로 ‘인맥’이었다. 하지만 이 기준이 요새는 ‘취향’으로 바뀌었다. 메가 급 인플루언서는 아닐지라도 내 취향과 결이 맞는 마이크로 인플루언서들을 팔로우하며 소비도 이들을 따라가고 있다는 것이다. 이 경향성이 점차 더 강해지고 있는 이유에 대해 취재 당시 이야기를 나눴던 권정윤 서울대 소비트렌드분석센터 연구위원은 “정보가 넘쳐나는 시대일수록 사람들은 물건 하나를 사더라도 신뢰할 수 있는 안목을 가진 누군가가 불필요한 정보를 걸러주거나 검증해주길 원한다”고 설명했다.\n하긴 가방 하나, 청바지 하나 사려고 해도 수많은 사이트에 수백 수천 개의 제품이 뜬다. 책 《도둑맞은 집중력》에서는 매일 한 사람에게 쏟아지는 정보의 양이 174종의 신문을 읽는 수준에 맞먹는다고 소개한다. 정보가 많아도 너무 많아서 개별 정보에 일일이 집중할 시간이 없다. 영향력 있는 인물이 이미 검증을 마친 ‘추천템’을 사는 게 시간은 아끼고, 실패할 확률은 줄이면서 트렌드도 따라갈 수 있는 가장 효율적인 방법이다. 수많은 정보 속에서 헤매지 않고 옳은 선택을 하게 만드는 지름길인 것이다.\n그래서일까. 주인공의 패션과 머리스타일, 행동 등을 음침하게 따라 하던 웹툰 〈치즈인더트랩〉의 캐릭터 이름을 본뜬 유행어 ‘손민수하다’도 디토 소비의 트렌드를 따라 예전보다 부정적인 뉘앙스를 많이 벗은 듯하다. 패션 커머스 플랫폼 에이블리는 브랜드 마케팅 콘텐츠로 ‘탑 아이돌 코디 손민수하기’ ‘손민수처럼 복붙하고 싶은 스타일’ 등을 제목으로 내세워 소비자들을 끌어 모으기도 한다. 얼마 전 대학원 동기들끼리 모인 저녁 자리에서도 한 지인이 다른 지인에게 “폰케이스 예쁘다. 나 이거 손민수해도 됨?”이라고 묻는 소리를 들었다. 아무렇지 않게 고개를 끄덕이던 폰케이스 주인을 보며 비슷한 소비 형태들도 시대에 따라 다른 얼굴을 띄게 된다는 걸 새삼 느낀 순간이었다.\n혹자는 이걸 ‘주체적인 소비가 아니다’ ‘개성이 사라지고 있다’며 비판할지 모르겠다. 하지만 꼭 그런 측면을 부각해 이 트렌드를 보고 싶지는 않다. 따지고 보면 세대별로 향유하고 기억하는 패션이나 문화 트렌드의 아이콘이 각기 다르듯, 그 시대 가장 멋져 보이는 누군가의 취향을 모방하는 건 과거부터 늘 존재해 왔다.\n오히려 따라하고 싶은 아이콘이 비교적 소수였던 그때와 달리 현재 디토 소비의 아이콘들은 SNS와 각종 플랫폼을 타며 더 개인화·세분화되고 있다. 최근 인스타그램을 통해 재사용 소재 가방 브랜드를 알게 돼 구매한 적이 있다. 그러다가 또 다른 브랜드의 정보를 얻고, 새로운 인플루언서를 내 팔로우 목록에 추가하기도 했다. 동물권을 보호하는 소비 자체에 대해서도 자연스럽게 관심이 생겼다. 디토 소비를 따라 찍히는 내 발자국 하나하나가 내 취향과 개성을 반영하고, 또 새롭게 만들어주고 있었다. 과거보다 우리의 면면은 넓디넓은 디토 소비의 선택지 속에서 한층 더 다채로워졌을 수 있다는 이야기다.\n디토 소비, 반품과 라이프스타일 사이\n물론 그럼에도 어딘가에 찜찜함이 남는 이유는 디토 소비가 만드는 과잉 소비의 굴레 때문일 것이다. 디토를 이끄는 주요 동력 중 무시할 수 없는 요소는 ‘나는 이렇게 제법 멋진 취향을 가진 사람이야’라는 걸 보여주고 싶은 과시욕, 이와 동시에 ‘트렌드에서 뒤처질지 모른다’는 두려움이다. 바야흐로 클릭이나 터치 몇 번으로 물건을 구매하는 시대다. 순간의 감정에 동해 ‘나도 살래’를 얼마나 쉽게 실천할 수 있는지 우리는 모두 잘 알고 있다. 언제 샀는지 기억조차 잘 나지 않는 처치 불가의 플라스틱 덩어리들을 얼마나 자주 마주했던가.\n책 《디컨슈머》에 따르면 현재 전 세계는 지구가 재생할 수 있는 속도보다 1.7배 빠른 속도로 지구의 자원을 소모하고 있다. 인간이 만든 물건들의 무게는 지구상 모든 생명체의 무게를 뛰어넘은 지 오래다. 알리익스프레스·테무 등 중국산 이커머스 플랫폼들의 국내 상륙과 함께 유행한 ‘테무깡’ 콘텐츠가 떠오른다. 말도 안 되는 저가의 상품을 대량 구매한 뒤 하나씩 언박싱하며 후기를 공유하는 이 콘텐츠에서 재미 요소는 ‘뽑기 실패’다. 쉽게 사는 물건은 버리기도 쉽다. 어차피 저렴하게 샀으니 반품하기 귀찮으면 바로 쓰레기통 행이다.\n이 테무깡·알리깡 콘텐츠의 유행을 보며 무엇을 소비하느냐의 문제를 넘어 소비하는 행위 그 자체도 디토가 될 수 있겠다는 생각을 했었다. 그 파급력은 과거의 디토와는 차원이 다른 파급력일 것이다. ‘나도 살래’ 한 번이 지구 어딘가에 부담을 남기고 있다는 사실을 직시한다면 결코 가볍게만 볼 수 없는 일이다.\n글로벌 브랜드 리바이스의 글로벌 혁신 담당 부사장 폴 딜린저는 코로나가 발생하기 훨씬 전 “의류 산업은 불필요한 소비 위에 세워져 있다”고 선언한 바 있다. 옷을 구매하려는 소비자들의 욕구가 끝없이 늘어날수록 그 옷을 만드는 데 필요한 자원은 언젠가 소진될 거라는 이야기였다. 그래서 그는 리바이스에 더 위협이 되는 건 사람들이 옷을 적게 사는 게 아니라 오히려 그 반대라고 주장했다.\n얼마 전 나의 모친은 미국 여행을 다녀온 지인으로부터 그 유명한 ‘트레이더 조Trader Joe’s’의 미니 에코백을 선물로 받았다. 내가 그 에코백이 최근 얼마나 유행이었는지 설명하며 수선을 부리자 모친은 “이게? 왜?”라고 되물었다. 인플루언서들 사이에서 입소문이 난 후 리셀 사이트에서 정가의 수백 배 가격에 판매될 정도로 인기를 끌었을지언정 이걸 모르는 이에게는 그냥 다른 에코백과 똑같은 에코백일 뿐이었다. 물론 모친은 그 이후로 트레이더 조 에코백을 외출용 가방으로 아주 잘 활용하고 계신다. 결국 무엇을 소비하든, 그게 디토든 아니든 간에 중요한 건 ‘내게 필요한 게 무엇인지 정확히 알고 소비하는 삶’을 살고 있느냐에 달려 있다고 본다. 그게 이 복잡다단한 소비의 딜레마 속에서 내가 내린 아주 단순한 결론이다.\n이런 건 어떤가. 개인적으로 디토 소비의 핵심이 특정 인물의 취향을 모방하고 추종하는 것에 있다면, 물질적인 것들에 대한 취향뿐 아니라 그 사람이 소비할 때 추구하는 가치나 방향에 대한 디토 소비도 더 주목받았으면 하는 바람이 있다. 예를 하나 들자면 며칠 전 유튜브 알고리즘에 걸려 우연히 연예인 크리스탈의 ‘왓츠 인 마이 백’ 영상을 봤는데, 10년 이상 쓴 보드게임·티셔츠·헤드셋 등 각종 소품들을 소개하는 그의 모습이 새삼 멋지게 다가왔다. 이 모습에 이끌려 내가 ‘물건을 한 번 사면 최대한 오랫동안 사용하는 소비 습관’을 따라하게 된다면 역시 디토 소비의 일종 아닐까. 선택지는 다양하다. ‘무엇을 살까’보다 ‘어떻게 살까’를 따라하는 소비까지 고민해 본다면, 우리 각자의 디토는 단순한 유행 추종을 넘어 더 많은 의미를 담게 될지도 모른다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 시시킴\n✱커버 그래픽: SNS 안에서 인플루언서들의 취향을 쇼핑하듯 둘러보며, ‘나와 닮은 취향’을 찾아가는 디토소비의 모습을 감각적으로 표현했습니다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n🔗 〈2025 토스픽〉 공유 이벤트\n\n소중한 사람에게 이 글을 공유해 보세요. \n⓵ 공유 버튼을 눌러 복사된 링크를 메신저, 블로그, SNS 등 원하는 채널로 공유하고, \n⓶ 공유한 화면을 캡처해 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}토스피드 인스타그램(@toss_feed) DM으로 보내면 참여 완료. \n매월 일상에 즐거움을 더해주는 선물을 준비했어요.  \n✱자세한 이벤트 선물과 참여 안내는 여기(링크)를 참고하세요.",

'성장 우선주의'의 산업화 시대를 거치며 간과해온 가치에 다시 주목하기 시작했죠. 인류가 훼손한 환경과 동물의 존엄성, 미래 세대를 고려하지 않은 무분별한 발전에 대한 반성과 저항 문화가 생긴 것입니다.\n새로운 시대적 가치를 비즈니스 모델로 정립한 브랜드가 소비자의 선택을 받기 시작했습니다. 친환경 유기농을 내세운 식품 기업 ‘홀푸드(Whole Foods)’, 환경과 지속 가능성을 최우선 가치로 생각하는 ‘파타고니아(Patagonia)’, 재활용 소재를 활용하고 탄소 발자국을 공개하는 신발 브랜드 ‘올버즈(Allbirds)’, 동물 실험 반대와 최소 포장을 강력하게 내세우는 코스메틱 브랜드 ‘러쉬(Lush)’ 등의 사례가 대표적입니다. 이 브랜드를 ‘선택’하는 행위를 통해 소비자는 자신의 가치관을 보여주게 됐습니다. 본격적인 ‘가치 소비’가 시작된 것이죠.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}간편하고

사례에서 볼 수 있는 것처럼 말이죠. 브랜드가 공감 가능한 가치 자체에 뿌리를 두고 있는지, 그리고 전문성과 결합해 신뢰 가능한 브랜드인지가 중요해졌습니다.\n결국, 소비자가 선택하는 브랜드는 '내가 지향하는 세상'을 실현하는 도구가 됩니다. 내가 중요하게 여기는 가치를 브랜드가 더 확산시켜 주기를 기대하며, 이를 통해 더 나은 세상, 더 나은 미래가 되길 희망합니다. 우리는 지갑을 열 때마다 ‘소비’라는 투표용지를 던짐으로써, 그 가치가 시장의 주류가 되도록 힘을 실어줍니다. 미래의 시장은 진정성과 전문성이라는 진심과 실력을 기반으로 소비자의 ‘가치 투표권’을 획득하는 브랜드가 끌어나갈 것입니다.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px

소비문화가 시장을 이끌었죠. 하지만 개인의 문화 자본이 경제 자본으로 전환되고, 취향의 세분화로 ‘틈새 니즈’가 발생하며 1인 기업, 인플루언서, 장인형 소상공인이 많아졌습니다. 그리고 이 인디 브랜드가 시장의 핵심 플레이어가 되기 시작했습니다.\n인디 브랜드의 확대는 디지털을 통해 나의 취향을 스트리밍할 수 있게 된 덕분이 큽니다. 사회학자 유승호는 《취향의 경제》 에서 지식과 정보에 쉽게 접근할 수 있는 시대가 됐고, 유튜브나 인스타그램 등 이른바 ‘대중 자아 기술’이 확대되면서 다양한 기회가 일반 대중에게도 열렸다고 말했죠. 기록과 채집이 취향을 증명했고, 경제 자본으로 전환되며 사회적 지위를 획득했습니다.\n취향은 이제 생계 수단으로도 확고히 자리매김했습니다. 시장 개척자의 지위, 동일 취향인과의 네트워크 효과, 그리고 팬과의 끈끈한 관계 덕분에 이들은 평균 이상의 높은 수익을 획득할 수 있게 됐죠. 그 결과, 취향을 기반으로 한 인디 브랜드도 충분히 자본을 창출할 수 있게 되었으며, 우리는 이를 ‘덕업일치’에 성공했다고 부릅니다. 좋아하는 ‘취향’이 곧 ‘직업’이 된 것입니다.\n인디 브랜드의 ‘연대’와 ‘협업’도 활성화되고 있습니다. 핫플레이스나 플랫폼은 다양한 인디 브랜드가 모여 뚜렷한 정체성을 획득한 곳이 많습니다. 인디 브랜드가 공동체를 만들면 규모의 경제를 이루고 주목도를 높이며 지속 가능성을 획득할 수 있죠. 앞으로 인디 브랜드의 성장과 더불어 인디 브랜드 간 ‘합종연횡’ 연대도 더 강화될 것으로 예상됩니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n엣시(Etsy)의 수공예 작가들: 전 세계

틔우는 경험:브랜드 경험을 설계하다\n경험은 취향을 발생시키고 발전하게 만드는 가장 큰 원동력입니다. 직접 겪어보면서 ‘호불호’를 판단하고, 취향으로 삼을지 결정하게 됩니다. 그래서 브랜드는 ‘차별화된 경험’을 소비자에게 제공하기 위해 치열하게 고민 중입니다. 경험이야말로 내 브랜드를 ‘취향’으로 만들 수 있는 가장 핵심적인 무기이기 때문입니다.\n소비자에게 경험을 파는 방향은 크게 3가지 방향으로 이뤄집니다.\n\n차별화된 경험\n희소한 경험\n소유 경험\n\n차별화된 경험은 경쟁 브랜드가 쉽게 모방할 수 없는 브랜드의 ‘핵심 자산’이 됩니다. 특히, 이 경험이 소비자에게 감동이나 깊은 만족감, 또는 소속감을 선사할 때, 단순한 제품 소비를 넘어 '나만의 브랜드'라는 애착을 형성합니다. 이러한 진정성 있는 경험을 통해 브랜드를 취향으로 받아들인 소비자는 단순한 고객을 넘어 ‘팬’이 되죠. 팬은 자발적인 ‘확산자(Evangelist)’가 되어 브랜드를 적극적으로 알리고 홍보하는 역할을 맡습니다. 결국, 브랜드가 개인의 취향이 되어 지속 가능한 성장을 이루기 위해서는 '차별화된 경험'은 선택이 아닌 필수가 됐습니다.\n두 번째는 희소한 경험을 파는 것입니다. 한정판 아이템이 대표적인데요. 모두에게 허락되지 않은 희소성은 ‘브랜드 경험’의 가치를 극대화합니다. 상품에 응모 뒤 당첨된 사람만 구매할 수 있는 ‘래플(Raffle)’과 ‘드로우(Draw)’ 문화, 그리고 정가에 프리미엄을 얹어 거래가 발생하는 리셀(Resell) 마켓이 급성장한 이유가 바로 희소성에 있습니다.\n마지막은 소유 효과를 활용한 경험입니다. 소유 효과(Endowment Effect)는 단순히 소유하는 것만으로도 대상에 대해 더 우호적이고 애착 관계가 생기는 심리 현상입니다. 굿즈가 대표적입니다. 브랜드 굿즈를 소유하고 있으면 브랜드에 대한 애착과 충성이 커지죠. 브랜드가 팝업 스토어나 플래그십 스토어 등 오프라인 공간에 적극적인 것 역시, 이 소유 효과를 활용하기 위함입니다. 소비자는 이 공간에서 제품을 직접 만지고, 사용하고, 사진을 찍는 등의 행위를 통해 '잠재적인 소유 경험'을 하게 됩니다. 이러한 경험은 브랜드에 심리적인 애착이 생기게 하는 중요한 기제가 됩니다.\n경험을 파는 브랜드는 앞으로 더 큰 영향력을 발휘할 것입니다. 취향 경제에서 브랜드 자체가 취향이 될 수 있는 지름길이 바로 '경험'이기 때문이죠. 차별화되고 희소하며 소유 효과를 갖는 경험을 지속 가능하게 제공하는 브랜드가 결국 살아 남는 브랜드가 될 것입니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n뉴발란스 '런 허브(Run Hub)’: 러닝화 전문 매장에서 단돈 3,000원에 최고급 러닝화와 의류를 2시간 동안 대여해주고 짐 보관 서비스를 제공. 소비자가 제품을 직접 신고 인근 도심 러닝

핵심 전략.\n국립중앙박물관 '뮷즈(MU:DS)': 국보 83호 '금동미륵반가사유상 미니어처', '취객선비 변색잔', '고려청자 에어팟 케이스' 등 유물을 현대적이고 실용적인 디자인으로 재해석한 '뮷즈'를 선보임. 전통 문화유산의 가치와 스토리를 일상에서 소유하게 함으로써, 브랜드(박물관)에 대한 애착과 충성도를 극대화하는 소유 경험의 대표적 사례.\n\n\n④ ‘같이’의 힘: 커뮤니티와 팬덤을 구축하다\n‘백지장도 맞들며 낫다’ 속담은 취향에도 적용됩니다. 혼자 즐기는 취향보다 ‘같이’ 즐기는 취향이 더 재밌고 즐겁죠. 취향 시대로 진입하면서 같은 취향과 관심사를 지닌 사람끼리 모인 ‘커뮤니티’가 공동체의 조직 원리로 작동했습니다. 우리의 공동체가 ‘취향’ 중심으로 바뀌게 된 것이죠.\n브랜드는 브랜드를 취향 삼은 소비자를 공동체로 묶기 위해 노력하고 있습니다. Z세대의 인기 문구 브랜드 ‘모트모트(Motemote)’는 문구를 판매하는 것을 넘어, ‘열공러’를 위한 강력한 온라인 커뮤니티를 구축한 사례로 잘 알려져 있습니다. 모트모트는 ‘모트모트 로켓단’을 만들어 서로 공부를 인증하고 격려하는 환경을 조성해 온라인에서 함께 공부하는 연대감을 형성했습니다. 유튜브 채널에서는 ‘실시간 독서실’라이브 방송으로 수많은 시청자가 함께 공부하고, 페이스 메이커 역할을 해주기도 했죠. 그 결과 소비자를 ‘열공 공동체’로서 묶어내며 ‘동기 부여’라는 강력한 가치를 만들었습니다.\n\n‘열공러’를 위한 강력한 온라인 커뮤니티를 구축하여 브랜드 충성도를 높인 모트모트 ⓒmotemote\n커뮤니티 구축 노력은 이제 업종을 불문하고 전방위적으로 펼쳐지고 있습니다. 출판사는 함께 책 읽는 사람들을 위한 북클럽을 만들었습니다. 경제 인플루언서는 투자 지식을 함께 나누는 네이버 카페를 선보였죠. 스포츠 브랜드는 러닝 클럽을 만들었고, 아웃도어 브랜드는 산을 함께 오르는 등산 클럽을 오픈했습니다. 기존에 연령·성별 기준으로 바라보던 ‘타깃 소비자’ 프레임이 ‘취향 소비자’로 바뀌었고, 같은 취향인을 모으기 위한 커뮤니티가 많아졌습니다.\n조심스럽게 예측해 보면, 커뮤니티를 가진 브랜드와 그렇지 못한 브랜드 간의 간극은 더 벌어질 것으로 생각합니다. 같은 취향을 가진 사람 간의 ‘연결’이 시장성을 만드는 규칙이 될 것입니다. 그리고 커뮤니티를 가진 브랜드는 이를 ‘팬덤’으로 발전시키기 위해 고민해야 합니다. 커뮤니티에 어떤 지속적인 가치를 줄 수 있을지, 어떻게 해야 공동체 일원이 브랜드에 자부심과 충성심을 가질 수 있을지 살펴봐야 하죠.\n데이비드 미어먼 스콧과 레이코 스콧은 『팬덤 경제학』에서 무엇이 팬덤을 구축하게 하는지를 알면, 소비자의 열정(passion)을 구매력(buying power)으로 전환하기 위한 로드맵을 그릴 수 있다고 말했습니다. 소비자의 열정을 연결하여 공동체를 만들고, 공동체가 팬덤이 되며, 팬덤이 브랜드 구매력을 만드는 로드맵이 모든 브랜드에 필요해졌습니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n룰루레몬(Lululemon): 단순히 운동복을 판매하는 것을 넘어, 매장과 지역별 앰버서더를 거점으로 요가 클래스, 러닝 클럽 등 무료 운동 이벤트를 정기적으로 개최하며 진정한 인간관계를 맺는 '커뮤니티 허브'를 지향.\nREI Co-op: 아웃도어 용품을

거대한 팬덤을 보유.\n\n\n⑤ 취향의 세계화: 틈새가 주류가 되다\n제가 뽑은 취향 경제의 마지막 브랜드 키워드는 ‘글로벌’입니다. 취향은 ‘틈새 니즈’를 의미하기도 합니다. 소수의 독특한 취향은 대중 상품으로는 만족시킬 수 없는 틈새시장을 만드는 핵심 동력이 되죠. 이런 취향이 처음 탄생할 때 시장성은 고려되지 않습니다. 취향은 취미 성격이 짙은 소수 문화로 시작합니다. 하지만 문화 자본이 경제 자본이 되기 위해서는 시장성이 필요합니다. 그 시장성을 만들어주는 것이 바로 ‘글로벌’입니다.\n특정 취향을 즐기는 국내 인구가 1%라면 타깃 소비자는 50만 명에 불과합니다. 하지만 전 세계로 확장되었을 때의 1%는 8천만 명에 달하죠. 아무리 작은 취향이라도 글로벌로 나아가면 큰 시장이 만들어질 수 있습니다. 그래서 취향 산업은 글로벌 진출이 필수입니다. 우리가 즐기는 음악·영화·뷰티·향수·패션 등 취향이 돋보이는 카테고리에서 글로벌 브랜드가 유독 많은 이유이기도 하죠.\n콘텐츠의 글로벌화도 가속화될 것입니다. 이전에는 잠재 관객 수가 적을 것으로 보이는 장르나 소재는 콘텐츠로 제작이 어려웠습니다. 시장성이 낮다고 판단된 것이죠. 하지만 넷플릭스와 유튜브가 등장하면서 달라졌습니다. 한 국가에서만의 공개가 아닌, 전 세계 공개가 가능해지면서 시장성을 확보하게 되었고, 그 결과 콘텐츠는 다양해졌습니다. 그리고 이는 취향의 시대를 더 가속화했죠.\n취향 시대의 브랜드는 ‘글로벌’을 선택이 아닌 필수로 생각해야 합니다. 더욱이 틈새 시장(Niche Market)을 겨냥하는 브랜드라면 말이죠. 그리고 디지털 플랫폼이 강력한 로켓이 되어줄 것입니다. 크리스 앤더슨은 『롱테일 경제학』에서 우리는 롱테일의 시대로 이동하고 있으며, 수많은 비인기 상품의 수요가 주류 상품의 수요를 능가할 수 있다고 말했습니다. 그리고 이 롱테일은 지리적 한계가 없는 글로벌 디지털 플랫폼에서만 실현될 수 있다고 했죠.\n앞으로도 디지털을 통해 ‘글로벌 취향인’을 만나는 브랜드는 수요와 시장성을 확보할 수 있을 것입니다. 이는 곧, 지속 가능성을 확보한다는 뜻이고 브랜드가 생명력을 가진다는 의미이기도 합니다. 디지털 플랫폼을 통한 글로벌 진출은 취향 경제 시대 속 또 다른 생존 공식입니다.\n\n🔍 More Cases\n\n샥즈(Shokz) : 2004년 중국에서 설립된 브랜드로 골전도 기술에 집중해 ‘골전도 헤드폰’을 출시. 쇼피파이 플랫폼을

피크(Snow Peak): 고가 하이엔드 캠핑 장비라는 니치 마켓을 개척하고, 장인 정신이 담긴 제품과 캠핑 문화를 결합하여 글로벌 라이프스타일 브랜드로 확장.\n\n\n소비자·기술·문화: 앞으로 취향 경제를 이끌 키워드\n‘취향 중심’으로 삶의 양상이 바뀐 소비자는 막강한 소비 권력으로 브랜드와 시장을 변화시켰습니다. 브랜드의 역할, 상품 구조, 마케팅, 유통 패러다임 등을 크게 뒤바꿨죠. 이제 ‘취향 경제’를 이해하지 않는 브랜드는 살아남기 어려워졌습니다.\n위의 5가지 키워드는 사실 새로운 것이 아닙니다. 비즈니스의 본질은 결국 ‘소비자’입니다. 소비자의 변화를 읽는 일과 소비자를 이해하는 일에 집중하면 이 키워드들은 자연스럽게 도출됩니다. 나의 가치관을 드러내는 소비, 내 취향에 맞으면 브랜드 규모는 상관없는 소비, 특별한 경험이 매력적인 소비, 나와 같은 취향을 가진 사람과의 소통, 전 세계 시장에 쉽게 닿는 소비는 결국 ‘소비자의 변화’에서 기인합니다. ‘소비자는 무엇을 원할까?’부터 ‘소비자의 소비는 어떻게 변할까?’를 생각해 보는 자세가 브랜드에 꼭 필요한 이유입니다.\n더불어 ‘기술’과의 접목도 함께 고려해야 합니다. 소비자의 라이프 스타일을 바꾼 변화는 기술에서 시작했습니다. 컴퓨터와 인터넷의 등장, 모바일의 등장, 그리고 AI의 등장까지 말이죠. 기술이 소비자의 변화를 이끄는 가장 강력한 동력인만큼, 기술에 대한 이해와 더불어 기술을 브랜드에 어떻게 접목해야 할지 생각해야 합니다. 예를 들면 한 피자 스타트업이 AI 기술을 통해 ‘나만을 위한 피자’를 만들 수 있는 공정 설계를 시작한 것처럼 말이죠. 취향 산업 전반에 기술이 가미될 것이고, 취향 경제는 더 급성장하게 될 것입니다.\n마지막으로 ‘문화적 브랜드’로의 자세도 강조하고 싶습니다. 브랜드 자체를 취향으로 삼기 위해서는 ‘문화적 관점’이 필요합니다. 모든 취향은 문화에서 시작됐습니다. 문화를 즐기는 소수에서 취향이 만들어지고 확대됐습니다. 소비자는 앞으로 더 까다로워질 것이고 취향의 심도는 깊어질 것입니다. 취향은 더 세분화되고 더 빨라지는 ‘비선형적 취향’일 가능성이 높습니다. 소비자의 취향에 맞춰 따라가기란 쉽지 않을 것입니다. \n그렇다면 오히려 브랜드가 취향이 되어, 브랜드를 추종하는 취향인을 양산하는 전략이 효과적일 수 있습니다. 할리데이비슨, 룰루레몬, 애플 등은 '문화'를 만들어 브랜드 자체가 취향이 된 대표적인 사례입니다. 이들처럼 문화를 만드는 것에 집중하는 것도 취향 경제 시대의 생존 전략일 수 있습니다. 소비자를 이해하고, 기술을 접목하며, 브랜드 자체가 문화가 되는 것. 이는 앞으로 더 확장될 취향 경제 시대에 브랜드를 움직이고 새로운 경제 질서를 만드는 가장 강력한 ‘정석’이 될 것입니다.\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0
