        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve improved personalized video recommendations on Facebook Reels by moving beyond metrics such as likes and watch time and directly leveraging user feedback. \nOur new User True Interest Survey (UTIS) model, now helps surface more niche, high-quality content and boosts engagement, retention, and satisfaction.\nWe’re doubling down on personalization, tackling challenges like sparse user data and bias, and exploring advanced AI to make recommendations even smarter and more diverse.\nOur paper, “Improve the Personalization of Large-Scale Ranking Systems by Integrating User Survey Feedback” shares full details on this work. \nDelivering personalized video recommendations is a common challenge for user satisfaction and long-term engagement on large-scale social platforms. At Facebook Reels, we’ve been working to close this gap by focusing on “interest matching” – ensuring that the content people see truly aligns with their unique preferences. By combining large-scale user surveys with recent advances in machine learning, we are now able to better understand and model what people genuinely care about, which has led to significant improvements in both recommendation quality and overall user satisfaction.\nWhy True Interest Matters\nTraditional recommendation systems often rely on engagement signals – such as likes, shares, and watch time – or heuristics to infer user interests. However, these signals can be noisy and may not fully capture the nuances of what people actually care about or want to see. Models trained only on these signals tend to recommend content that has high short-term user value measured by watch time and engagement but doesn’t capture true interests that are important for long-term utility of the product. To bridge this gap, we needed a more direct way to measure user perception of content relevance. Our research shows that effective interest matching goes beyond simple topic alignment; it also encompasses factors like audio, production style, mood, and motivation. By accurately capturing these dimensions, we can deliver recommendations that feel more relevant and personalized, encouraging people to return to the app more frequently.\nRecommendation systems are typically optimized based on user interactions on the product, such as watch time, likes, shares, etc. However, by incorporating user perception feedback – like interest match and novelty – we can significantly improve relevance, quality, and the overall ecosystem.\n\nHow We Measured User Perception\nTo validate our approach, we launched large-scale, randomized surveys within the video feed, asking users, “How well does this video match your interests?” These surveys were deployed across Facebook Reels and other video surfaces, enabling us to collect thousands of in-context responses from users every day. The results revealed that previous interest heuristics only achieved a 48.3% precision in identifying true interests, highlighting the need for a more robust measurement framework. \nBy weighting responses to correct for sampling and nonresponse bias, we built a comprehensive dataset that accurately reflects real user preferences – moving beyond implicit engagement signals to leverage direct, real-time user feedback.\n\nFramework: User True Interest Survey (UTIS) Model\nDaily, a certain proportion of users viewing sessions on the platform are randomly chosen to display a single-question survey asking, “To what extent does this video match your interests?” on a 1-5 scale. The survey aims to gather real-time feedback from users about the content they have just viewed.\nThe main candidate ranking model used by the platform is a large multi-task, multi-label model. We trained a lightweight UTIS alignment model layer on the collected user survey responses using existing predictions of the main model as input features. The survey responses used to train our model were binarized for easy modelling and denoises variance in responses. In addition, new features were engineered to capture user behavior, content attributes, and interest signals with the object function to optimize predicting users’ interest-matching extent.\nThe UTIS model outputs the probability that a user is satisfied with a video, and is designed to be interpretable, allowing us to understand the factors contributing to users’ interest matching experience.\nUser perception feedback collected using surveys are extremely sparse but such feedback can be generalized in large scale recommendation systems using our novel model “Perception Layer” architecture that uses existing event predictions as additional features.\nIntegrating the UTIS Model in the Main Ranking System\nWe have experimented with and deployed several use cases of the UTIS model in our ranking funnel, all of which showed successful tier 0 user retention metric improvements:\nLate Stage Ranking (LSR): UTIS is deployed in parallel to the LSR model, providing an additional input feature into the final value formula. This allows fine-tuning of the final ranking stage to incorporate true interests while balancing other concerns.\nEarly Stage Ranking (Retrieval): UTIS is used to reconstruct users’ true interest profiles by aggregating survey data to predict affinity for any given user-video pair, allowing us to re-rank the user interest profile and source more candidates relevant to users’ true interests. Also, large sequences based on user-to-item retrieval models are aligned using knowledge distillation based objectives trained on UTIS predictions from LSR as labels. \nThe UTIS model score is now one of the inputs to our ranking system. Videos predicted to be of high interest receive a modest boost, while those with low predicted interest are demoted. This approach has led to: \nIncreased delivery of high-quality, niche content. \nA reduction in low-quality, generic popularity based recommendations.\nImprovements in like, share, and follow rates.\nImproved user engagement and retention metrics.\nSince launching this approach, we’ve observed robust offline and online performance\nOffline Performance: The UTIS model delivered an improvement in accuracy and reliability over the heuristic rule baseline. Accuracy increased from 59.5% to 71.5%, precision improved from 48.3% to 63.2%, and recall increased from 45.4% to 66.1%. These gains demonstrate the model’s ability to help in accurately identifying users’ interest preferences.\nOnline Performance: Large-scale A/B testing with over 10 million users confirmed these improvements in real-world settings. The UTIS model consistently outperformed the baseline, driving higher user engagement and retention. Notably, we saw a +5.4% increase in high survey ratings, a -6.84% reduction in low survey ratings, a +5.2% boost in total user engagement, and a -0.34% decrease in integrity violations. These results highlight the model’s effectiveness in improving user experience and matching users with relevant interests.\nFuture Work for Interest Recommendations\nBy integrating survey-based measurement with machine learning, we are creating a more engaging and personalized experience – delivering content on Facebook Reels that feels truly tailored to each user and encourages repeat visits. While survey-driven modeling has already improved our recommendations, there remain important opportunities for improvement, such as better serving users with sparse engagement histories, reducing bias in survey sampling and delivery, further personalizing recommendations for diverse user cohorts and improving the diversity of recommendations. To address these challenges and continue advancing relevance and quality, we are also exploring advanced modeling techniques, including large language models and more granular user representations.\nRead the Paper\nImprove the Personalization of Large-Scale Ranking Systems by Integrating User Survey Feedback\n    background-color: #0064E0;      /* Meta Blue */\n    color: #ffffff !important;      /* Force white text */\n    padding: 10px 20px;             /* Button size */\n    border: none;                   /* No border */\n    border-radius: 5px;             /* Rounded corners */\n    cursor: pointer;                /* Pointer cursor on hover */\n    text-decoration: none;          /* Remove underline */\n    display: inline-block;          /* Button-like display */\n    font-weight: bold;              /* Optional: bold text */\n    transition: color 0.3s ease, background-color 0.3s ease; /* Smooth transitions */\n  }\n  .meta-btn:hover {\n    color: #808080 !important;      /* Grey text on hover */\n  }\n\nThe post Adapting the Facebook Reels RecSys AI Model Based on User Feedback appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This post was written together with Thorben Janssen, who has more than 20 years of experience with JPA and Hibernate and is the author of “Hibernate Tips: More than 70 Solutions to Common Hibernate Problems” and the JPA newsletter.\nKotlin and Jakarta Persistence (also known as JPA) are a popular combination for server-side development. Kotlin offers concise syntax and modern language features, while Jakarta Persistence provides a proven persistence framework for enterprise applications.\nHowever, Jakarta Persistence was originally designed for Java. Some of Kotlin’s popular features and concepts, like null safety and data classes, help you tremendously when implementing your business logic, but they don’t align well with the specification.\nThis article outlines a set of best practices to help you avoid problems and build reliable persistence layers with Kotlin and Jakarta Persistence. And to share some good news before diving in, IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1 will automatically detect many of these issues, highlight them with warnings, and provide support through various inspections.\nEntity class design\nJakarta Persistence defines several requirements for entity classes that form the foundation for how persistence providers manage entity objects.\nAn entity class must:\nProvide a no-argument constructor\nThe persistence provider uses reflection to call the no-argument constructor to create entity instances when loading data from the database.\nHave non-final attributes\nWhen fetching an entity object from the database, the persistence provider sets all attribute values after it calls the no-argument constructor to instantiate the entity object. This process is called hydration.\nAfter that is done, the persistence provider keeps a reference to the entity object to perform automatic dirty checks, during which it detects changes and updates the corresponding database records automatically.\nBe non-final\nThe persistence provider often creates proxy subclasses to implement features such as lazy loading for @ManyToOne and @OneToOne relationships. For this to work, the entity class can’t be final.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to these specification requirements, it is a widely accepted best practice to:\nImplement equals, hashCode, and toString carefully\nThese methods should rely only on the entity’s identifier and type to avoid unexpected behavior in persistence contexts. You can find approaches for better implementing those here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese rules are easy to follow in Java but conflict with some of Kotlin’s defaults, such as final classes, immutable properties, and constructor-based initialization.\nThe following sections show how to adapt your Kotlin classes to meet these requirements while still using Kotlin’s language features effectively.\nData classes vs. entities\nKotlin’s data classes are designed to hold data. They are final and provide several utility methods, including getters and setters for all fields, as well as equals, hashCode, and toString.\nThis makes data classes a great fit for DTOs, which represent query results and are not managed by your persistence provider.\nBelow is a typical usage of a data class to fetch data:\ndata class EmployeeWithCompany(val employeeName: String, val companyName: String)\n\nval query = entityManager.createQuery(\"\"\"\n   SELECT new com.company.kotlin.model.EmployeeWithCompany(p.name, c.name)\n    FROM Employee e\n       JOIN e.company c\n    WHERE p.id = :id\"\"\")\n\nval employeeWithCompany = query.setParameter(\"id\", 1L).singleResult;\nHowever, entities differ because they are managed objects. And that causes problems when you model them as a data class.\nFor entities, the persistence provider automatically detects changes and uses lazy loading for relationships. To support this, it expects entity classes to follow the requirements defined in the Jakarta Persistence specification, which we discussed at the beginning of this chapter. \nAs you can see in the following table, that makes Kotlin’s data classes a bad fit for entity classes.\n\nKotlin Data ClassJakarta Persistence Entity\nClass TypeFinalMust be open (non-final) so the provider can create proxy subclasses\nConstructorsPrimary constructor with required parametersMust provide a no-argument constructor, used by the persistence provider\nMutabilityImmutable by default (val properties)Must have mutable, non-final attributes so the provider can perform lazy loading as well as detect and persist changes\nequals and hashCodeUse all propertiesShould rely only on type and primary key\ntoStringIncludes all propertiesShould only reference eagerly loaded attributes to avoid additional queries\n\n\n\n\n\nThe recommended approach is to use regular open classes to model your entities. They are mutable and proxy-friendly, and they don’t cause any issues with Jakarta Persistence.\n@Entity\nopen class Person {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n}\nNon-final classes and no-argument constructors\nAs discussed earlier, Jakarta Persistence requires entity classes to be non-final and provide a no-argument constructor. \nKotlin’s classes are final by default and don’t have to offer a no-argument constructor.\nBut don’t worry, it’s easy to fulfill the requirements without changing your code or implementing your entity classes in a specific way. Just add the no-arg and all-open plugins and add kotlin-reflect to your dependencies. This adds the required constructor and marks annotated classes as open at build time.\nCurrently, you need the compiler plugins plugin.spring and plugin.jpa, which will automatically add the no-arg and all-open plugins. When creating a new Spring project using the New Project wizard in IntelliJ IDEA or via start.spring.io, both plugins are automatically configured for you. And starting with IntelliJ IDEA 2026.1, this will also be the case when you add a Kotlin file to an existing Java project.\nplugins {\n   kotlin(\"plugin.spring\") version \"2.2.20\"\n   kotlin(\"plugin.jpa\") version \"2.2.20\"\n}\n\nallOpen {\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Entity\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.MappedSuperclass\")\n   annotation(\"jakarta.persistence.Embeddable\")\n}\nWhen configuring this manually, pay close attention to both parts of this setup. plugin.jpa appears to provide the required configuration, but it only configures the no-arg plugin, not the all-open one. This will be improved with the upcoming JPA plugin update. You will then no longer have to add the allOpen section. See: KT-79389\nMutability\nAs a Kotlin developer, you’re used to analyzing whether information is mutable or immutable and modelling your classes accordingly. And when defining your entities, you might want to do the same. But that creates potential issues.\nvar vs. val\nIn Kotlin, you use val to define an immutable field or property and var for mutable ones. Under the hood, val is compiled in Java to a final field. But as discussed earlier, the Jakarta Persistence specification requires all fields to be non-final.\nSo, in theory, you can’t use val when modelling your entities. However, if you look at various projects, you can find several entities that use val without causing any bugs.\n@Entity\nclass Person(name: String) {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String = name\n}\nThat’s because your Jakarta Persistence implementation, the persistence provider, populates entity fields through reflection if you use field-based access, which is usually the case when implementing Jakarta Persistence entities in Kotlin. final fields can also be modified using reflection. As a result, your persistence provider can modify val fields, but this contradicts Kotlin’s immutability guarantees.\nSo, practically, you can use val to model immutable fields of your entity class. Still, it’s not in line with the Jakarta Persistence specification, and your fields are not as immutable as you might expect. To make it even worse, JEP 500: Prepare to Make Final Mean Final discusses introducing a warning and future changes to restrict final field modifications via reflection. This would prevent you from using val on your entity fields and break many persistence layers using Jakarta Persistence and Kotlin.\nBe careful when using val for your entity fields and make sure everyone on your team understands the implications.\nStarting with version 2026.1, IntelliJ IDEA will display a weak warning indicating that a val field will be modified when the persistence provider, such as Hibernate or EclipseLink, instantiates the entity object.\nAccess types\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification defines two access types that determine if your persistence provider uses getter and setter methods to access your entity’s fields or reflection.\nYou can define the access type explicitly by annotating your entity class with the @Access annotation. Or, as almost all development teams do, define it implicitly by where you place your mapping annotations:\nAnnotations on entity fields → field access = direct access using reflection\nAnnotations on getter methods → property access = access via getter or setter methods\nMost Kotlin developers put their annotations on properties, which Hibernate treats as field access by default.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nIn this example, it might look like the getter and setter methods will be called to access the name property. But that’s only the case for your business logic. Because we annotated the fields, the persistence provider will use reflection to access them directly, bypassing the getter and setter methods.\nAs a general best practice, it’s recommended to stick to field access. It’s easier to read and lets your persistence provider access the entity’s fields directly. You can then provide getter and setter methods that help your business code without affecting your database mapping.\nIf you want to use property access, you can either annotate your entity class with @Access(AccessType.PROPERTY) or annotate the accessors explicitly:\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String? = null\n       get() {\n           println(\"Getter called\")\n           return field\n       }\n       set(value) {\n           println(\"Setter called\")\n           field = value\n       }\n}\nHowever, when you do this, you must ensure that all fields are defined as var. Kotlin doesn’t provide setter methods for fields defined as val.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @get:Id\n   @get:GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   val name: String? = null \n}\nYou can see this when checking Kotlin’s decompiled bytecode of a snippet above.\nimport jakarta.persistence.Entity;\nimport jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;\nimport jakarta.persistence.Id;\nimport kotlin.Metadata;\nimport org.jetbrains.annotations.Nullable;\n\n\n@Entity\n…\npublic final class Company {\n  @Nullable\n  private Long id;\n  @Nullable\n  private final String name;\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  @Nullable\n  public final Long getId() {\n     return this.id;\n  }\n\n  public final void setId(@Nullable Long var1) {\n     this.id = var1;\n  }\n\n  @Nullable\n  public final String getName() {\n     return this.name;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nYour persistence provider will check that each field has a getter and a setter method. As long as you use var to define your entity fields, property access works with Kotlin.\nNull safety and default values\nNull safety and default values are two popular features in Kotlin that don’t exist in that form in Java. It’s no surprise that you have to pay special attention if you want to use them in your Jakarta Persistence entities.\nNullability considerations (including primary key fields)\nKotlin allows you to define whether a field or property supports null values. Unfortunately, reflection can bypass Kotlin’s null prevention, and as explained earlier, the persistence provider uses reflection to initialize your entity objects.\nEven if you define an entity attribute as non-nullable, your persistence provider will set it to null if the database contains a null value. In your business code, this can lead to runtime exceptions similar to those seen in Java.\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"user\")\nclass User(\n   @Id\n   var id: Long? = null\n\n   var name: String\n)\n\nfun testLogic(){\n   // Suppose the row with id = 1 has name = NULL in the database\n   val user = userRepository.findById(1).get()\n   println(\"Firstname: ${user.name}\") // null, because Hibernate saves null via reflection\n}\nAnd unfortunately, solving this problem is not as easy as it seems.\nYou could argue that all non-nullable entity fields should map to a database column with a not-null constraint. So, your database can’t contain any null values.\nIn general, this is a great approach. But it does not eliminate the risk completely. Constraints can get out of sync between different environments or during migrations. Therefore, using not-null constraints on your database is highly recommended, but it doesn’t provide an unbreakable guarantee that you will never fetch a null value from the database.\nTo make it even worse, all Jakarta Persistence implementations call the no-argument constructor of your entity class to instantiate an object and then use reflection to initialize each field. This means that technically, all your entity fields must be nullable.\nWhat does that mean for your entities? Should you use val or var to model your fields?\nThat decision is ultimately up to you. Both of them work, but we recommend sticking to the Kotlin way: Use val if an entity field is not supposed to be changed by your business logic, and var otherwise. However, due to the issues discussed earlier, it is also essential to ensure that everyone on your team is aware that your Jakarta Persistence implementation may set those fields to null if your database lacks a not-null constraint.\n@Id and generated value\nThe previous paragraphs already discussed why all entity fields should be nullable. However, many developers consider primary key attributes to be distinct because the database requires a primary key value, and the Jakarta Persistence specification defines it as immutable. Primary keys are mandatory and immutable as soon as you persist the entity object in your database. But let’s quickly discuss why this doesn’t mean that primary key values should be not-nullable, especially if you’re using database-generated primary key values.\nWhen you want to store a new record in your database, you create a new entity object without a primary key and persist it. \nUnfortunately, the Jakarta Persistence specification doesn’t clearly define how to implement the persist operation. But it requires generating a primary key value if none is provided. The handling of provided primary key values differs across implementations, but that’s a topic for a different article. \nThe important thing here is that all persistence providers treat null as a not-provided primary key value. They then use a database sequence or an auto-incremented column to generate a primary key value and set it on the entity object. Due to this mechanism, the primary key value is null before the entity gets persisted, and changes during the persist operation.\nAn interesting side note is that Hibernate handles the primary key value 0 differently when calling the persist or the merge method. The persist method throws an exception because it expects the object to be an already-persisted entity. In contrast, Hibernate’s merge method generates a new primary key value and inserts a new record into the database. That’s why you can model a primary key with the default value 0 and save the new entity object using Spring Data JPA. The default repository implementation recognizes the already set primary key value and calls the merge method instead of the persist method.\nNow, returning to the initialization of primary key fields.\nWhen you fetch an entity object from the database, your persistence provider uses the parameterless constructor to instantiate a new object. It then uses reflection to set the primary key value before it returns the entity object to your business code.\nAll of this clearly shows that the Jakarta Persistence specification expects the primary key field to be mutable, even though the primary key value is not allowed to change after it was assigned. To avoid any portability issues across different Jakarta Persistence implementations, use null to represent an undefined primary key value.\n@Entity\nclass Company {\n   @Id\n   @GeneratedValue\n   var id: Long? = null\n}\nDeclaring default values\nKotlin’s support for default values can simplify your business code and prevent null values. \n@Entity\nclass Company(\n   @Id @GeneratedValue \n   var id: Long? = null,\n\n   @NotNull\n   var name: String = \"John Doe\",\n\n   @Email\n   var email: String = \"default@email.com\"\n)\nHowever, please be aware that these default values will have no effect when your persistence provider fetches an entity object from the database.\nval companyFromDb = companyRepository.findById(1).get()\nprintln(companyFromDb.email) // <- If email in DB is empty, it will not set to \"default@email.com\"\nThe Jakarta Persistence specification requires a parameterless constructor that the implementations call when fetching an entity object from the database. After that, they use reflection to map all values retrieved from the database to the corresponding entity fields. As a result, the default values defined in your constructor will not be used, and some fields of your entity object might not be set even though you expect your constructor to assign default values. This may not cause any issues in your application, but it is something you and your team should be aware of.\nAnnotation placement\nIn Java, annotations are typically applied directly to the field, method, or class you annotate. In Kotlin, by contrast, annotations can target different elements, such as constructor parameters, properties, or fields.\nBefore Kotlin 2.2, this often caused problems because annotations applied to properties were applied only to the constructor parameter by default. This often caused problems for Jakarta Persistence and validation frameworks. Annotations like @NotNull, @Email, or even @Id didn’t end up where the framework expected them to be. This led to missed validations or mapping issues.\nThe good news is that this has been improved in Kotlin 2.2. With the new compiler option, which IntelliJ IDEA will suggest enabling, annotations will be applied to the constructor parameter and the property or field by default. So, your code now works as expected without requiring any changes.\nTo learn more, check out the blog post.\nIntelliJ IDEA to the rescue!\nIn the upcoming 2026.1 release, IntelliJ IDEA will provide inspections and quick-fixes to address many of the problems mentioned in this article, thereby improving your overall experience.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The IntelliJ Platform provides a powerful debugger framework that plugins can extend to support various programming languages and runtime environments. To enable remote development scenarios – where the IDE interface runs on your local machine while code executes on a remote server – we’ve redesigned the debugger architecture. This guide walks you through the changes and shows you how to migrate your plugin for 2026.1 and beyond.\nWhy split the debugger?\nIn the last several releases, we re‑architected the IntelliJ Platform debugger to support Remote Development mode. The major change visible to users is that the Debugger tool window and breakpoints are now rendered on the frontend, while the backend hosts the active debugger session and communicates with the target process. As a result, the debugger experience in Remote Development mode is much more responsive and stable. However, these changes have modified the debugger implementation and might affect existing plugins.\nTo provide the same experience in both Remote Development and Local IDE modes, we use a single implementation for both. Therefore, the changes described in this guide can affect plugins in both modes.\nImportant: This guide focuses primarily on plugin support in Local mode. For migration steps for Remote Development mode, see the section below.\nWhat’s changed?\nTo support Remote Development mode, we split the debugger into two parts: frontend and backend. The frontend is responsible for rendering the Debugger tool window (frames, variables’ tree, inlays, etc.). The backend hosts the active debugger session started by a plugin and provides data to the frontend via RPC (Remote Procedure Call).\nAs a result of these changes, several debugger API contracts have changed.\nThe debugger UI is now created asynchronously, so older methods that access the debugger UI or the Debugger tab may cause race conditions.\nThe frontend implementation no longer works directly with entities provided by plugins via XDebugProcess and XSuspendContext. For example, XStackFrame, XValue, and other instances are no longer available on the frontend. Instead, we use FrontendXValue wrappers that cannot be cast to plugin‑specific XValue implementations.\nExample: Suppose you have a plugin that implements a custom debugger. The plugin extends XDebugProcess as MyDebugProcess and provides custom implementations: MyStackFrame (which extends XStackFrame), MyValue (which extends XValue), and other entities. In addition to the backend implementation, the plugin provides an action that assumes the platform debugger UI operates on those entities directly (e.g. XValueNodeImpl contains MyValue).\nNow that the debugger has been split, the platform debugger UI operates with FrontendXValue and other frontend wrappers instead (e.g. XValueNodeImpl now contains FrontendXValue). As a result, actions operating on the debugger UI may unexpectedly access frontend entities and fail to cast them to plugin entities (e.g. FrontendXValue is not an instance of MyValue). See the following sections for more details.\nWhat should I do?\nTest your plugin with the 2026.1 EAP. UI components and actions are the areas most likely to be affected.\nPay attention to error messages in the IDE log. Incorrect debugger API usage will be logged with the [Split debugger] message prefix and an explanation of the migration steps.\nTwo migration paths:\nDepending on your plugin requirements, choose one of the following migration paths:\nLocal mode only – Migrate from the affected APIs below to the recommended ones. Your plugin will work in Local IDE mode, but some functionality may work incorrectly in Remote Development.\nLocal + Remote Development modes – Follow the Remote Development mode migration steps below to support both modes.\nIf you encounter unexpected API behavior, please report it in YouTrack.\nWhich APIs are affected in Local IDE mode?\nThe following APIs related to the debugger UI are deprecated and unsafe to use since 2026.1:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getRunContentDescriptor – deprecated and must not be used, as the frontend UI should not be accessed from the backend. See the Javadoc for more details.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI – deprecated and must not be used. Can lead to race conditions due to asynchronous creation of the frontend UI.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab (internal) – deprecated and must not be used. Can also lead to race conditions.\nWorkaround: Use com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady.\nWhich APIs are safe to use in Local IDE mode?\nAll APIs that provide data to the backend are valid and safe to use in Local mode, such as XDebugProcess, XSuspendContext, and the data they provide.\nFor creating debugger‑related actions, the following APIs are supported:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.actions.handlers.XDebuggerActionHandler\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XDebuggerTreeActionBase\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.ui.tree.actions.XFetchValueActionBase\nThese actions should not require changes in Local IDE mode. They have been adapted to use plugin‑specific entities instead of frontend wrappers to preserve compatibility with the older implementation.\nRemote Development mode migration steps\nThe following APIs will NOT work in Remote Development mode:\nUI and Debugger tab access:\n\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugSession#getUI\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl#getSessionTab\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenTabReady\nBase action classes that work with debugger nodes:\n\nXDebuggerTreeActionBase\nXFetchValueActionBase\nUse these alternatives instead:\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter – use this to provide additional tabs in the Debugger tool window.\ncom.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebugSessionImpl.runWhenUiReady – also works for adding tabs, but com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebugProcess.createTabLayouter is the recommended approach.\nXDebuggerTreeBackendOnlyActionBase – an alternative to XDebuggerTreeActionBase that works only with XValue instead of nodes.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Android Gradle plugin 9.0 is now available, and it includes two major changes that will affect existing Kotlin projects:\nAndroid apps need to start using AGP 9.0’s built-in Kotlin support.\nKotlin Multiplatform projects targeting Android need to migrate to the new Android KMP library plugin.\nThis post provides some details about these changes and points you to the resources that you’ll need to update your existing projects.\nYou’ll also need to update tools and plugins that depend on AGP to their latest versions with support for AGP 9.0. If you use Android Studio, you’ll need to use Otter 3 Feature Drop or later.\nNote: Support for AGP 9.0 is coming soon to IntelliJ IDEA, expected to arrive in Q1 2026.\nFor information about Gradle plugin compatibility, you can refer to this community-maintained page.\nWe are working on adopting AGP 9.0 in our documentation, samples, and wizards. This means that they will all use AGP 9.0 by default and already include these changes in their respective configurations.\nUse built-in Kotlin\nPreviously, Android projects had to apply the Kotlin Android plugin (org.jetbrains.kotlin.android) to add support for Kotlin source files. With AGP 9.0, Kotlin support is built in and enabled by default, so you no longer need to apply the Kotlin Android plugin separately for Android apps.\nThe main migration step here is to remove usages of the Kotlin Android plugin from your projects. However, if your project uses kapt for annotation processing or sets custom kotlinOptions, you’ll need to update those configurations as well.\nRead the migration guide in the Android documentation for step-by-step instructions.\nWith AGP 9.0, you can still opt out of these changes temporarily by adding android.builtInKotlin=false and android.newDsl=false to your gradle.properties. However, this will no longer work in AGP 10.0, which is expected sometime in 2026.\nUse the new Android KMP library plugin\nIn previous versions, the Android Gradle plugin provided two different plugins you could apply to a module:\nThe Android library plugin (com.android.library).\nThe Android application plugin (com.android.application).\nEither of them could be used in combination with the KMP plugin (org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform) to set up a multiplatform module.\nAGP 9.0 introduces a new, simplified Android KMP library plugin (com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library), built specifically for multiplatform projects. The previously used Android library and Android application plugins are no longer compatible with the KMP plugin in the same module, which means you’ll need to migrate any multiplatform modules to the new plugin. This migration will be different for library and application modules; you can learn more about both scenarios below.\nWith AGP 9.0, you can still opt out of these changes temporarily by adding android.enableLegacyVariantApi=true to your gradle.properties. However, this will no longer work in AGP 10.0, which is expected sometime in 2026.\nMigrating a library module\nIf you have a module that uses the Android library plugin and the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin together, you’ll have to replace the Android library plugin with the Android KMP library plugin. This means you’ll have to update the build configuration of your existing module, but generally no changes are required to your project structure or source code.\nThe new Android KMP library plugin has default settings that are designed for Kotlin Multiplatform and optimized for build speed and stability. Some previous configuration options have been removed or moved to new APIs.\nRead the migration guide to learn about the differences and get step-by-step instructions on how to migrate a library module to the new plugin.\nMigrate a library module\n                                                    \nMigrating an application module\nMany projects apply both the Android application plugin and the Kotlin Multiplatform plugin in the same module. A module like this contains shared multiplatform code as well as an Android application with all of its related build configuration. This was the recommended structure in the past, and if you created your project using the KMP wizard, your project probably has a single composeApp module that’s set up like this.\nThe starting setup\nModules like this also have to be migrated to use the new Android KMP library plugin in the module that contains shared code, which requires multiple steps.\nFirst, you’ll have to create a new module for the entry point of your app and apply the Android application plugin there. This new module can be relatively small and simple, containing the build configuration to package an Android app and its entry point, such as Activity and Application classes (all represented by MainActivity in the illustrations here).\nWhen using AGP 9.0, this new module doesn’t need to apply a Kotlin plugin, as it can use the built-in Kotlin support (as detailed above).\nThen, this new application module should depend on the existing multiplatform module to have access to its contents. The multiplatform module can now become an Android library, which means you should migrate it to the new Android KMP library plugin.\nThe migrated project\nTo migrate an Android application module to AGP 9.0, follow the detailed steps in the migration guide.\nMigrate an application module\n                                                    \nConclusion\nWe recommend making these configuration changes in your existing projects as soon as possible to ensure smooth upgrades to the latest versions of AGP in the future.\nIn addition to the links above, you can read the full release notes for AGP 9.0 to learn more about what’s new.\nIf you encounter any issues with AGP 9.0 itself, create a new issue in the Android Studio component of the Google issue tracker.\nFor problems related to the Kotlin Multiplatform IDE plugin, create an issue in the KMT tracker.\nTo provide feedback on Kotlin documentation, create an issue on YouTrack or report it in the #multiplatform channel on the Kotlinlang Slack.",

AI is already a daily tool for 85% of developers, and 68% expect AI proficiency to become a non-negotiable part of job descriptions within the next few years (according to the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025).\nAt JetBrains, we leverage it every day. AI is changing how we write, review, and ship code. We build AI-powered products like AI Assistant and Junie, train models like Mellum, and create frameworks like Koog so others can build their own AI agents.\nWhile everyone’s talking about AI, the conversations vary wildly, from doomsday scenarios to starry-eyed optimism, and everything in between. TransformConf is our attempt to create space for practical discussions. We want you to bring home more than cool merch – we want you to leave with insights you can immediately apply to your work.\nSince 2017, we’ve organized KotlinConf, the biggest yearly Kotlin event and a true celebration of the community. We know how impactful offline events can be. Our hope is that TransformConf becomes the place to discuss AI in software development in a way that impacts both today and tomorrow, a community where you feel at home, and a source of development and inspiration.\nKey details\nThe first TransformConf will take place September 15–16, 2026, at Tobacco Dock in London, UK.\nWho is it for?\nAnyone who is building AI, using AI tools, integrating AI into their products, platforms, and workflows, or preparing to do so. Developers are always at the heart of everything we do, so expect an engineering focus, but we also want to see ML researchers and engineers, DevOps specialists, technical leaders, architects, developer experience and productivity engineers, and anyone on product teams working with AI in production.\nWhat to expect?\nTwo days in London, packed with educational talks, peer discussions, booth meetings, professional reflection, and some fun activities. We’re planning 45-minute and 15-minute talks across three parallel tracks. The program will cover these practical and forward-looking topics:\nBuilding, deploying, and maintaining AI systems end to end\nAligning AI development across disciplines\nAdvanced modeling and training techniques\nDeveloper education and techniques in an AI-driven landscape\nLong-term changes to programming, teams, and the software industry\nSeparating myths from reality, addressing ethics, compliance, and long-term impact\nRethinking developer productivity and human-AI collaboration\nHow do I stay in touch?\nIf TransformConf is something you’re interested in, subscribe to our newsletter for updates on speakers, the program, tickets, and more. \nWhat about speaking and partnership opportunities?\nThe call for speakers is open!

        "pubDate": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:08:14 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hello everyone,\nAs I write these words, the Scala compiler team is wrapping up the Scala 3.8 release. It’s the last major release before a feature freeze. The next one, 3.9, will be the new Long-Term Support version. The compiler team decided that most of the work between 3.8 and 3.9 will go into stabilization, while new features and other improvements will be released with Scala 3.8. By providing support for the new Scala 3.8 features now, we’re able to give you the opportunity to enjoy and test them immediately. This will give both our team and the compiler team the opportunity to collect more and better feedback from you.\n\n\n\n\nThe into modifier\nThere’s a new modifier in Scala syntax, into, that can be used in two ways: as a wrapper over a type or as a soft keyword in front of classes, traits, opaque type aliases, and enum types. By wrapping a type with into[T] – for example, a type of a function parameter – we indicate that any type implicitly convertible to the declared type inside the into wrapper is accepted without requiring the implicitConversions import. The Scala plugin understands this mechanism, correctly infers types, and highlights cases where the conversion isn’t possible. In the future, using an implicit conversion without the implicitConversions import will be treated as an error.\n\n\n\n\nNotice that into is used as a type wrapper for elems, but at the same time we can still use elems.iterator as if elems was of the underlying type IterableOnce[A].\nAlternatively, if the type is in your codebase, you can also add the into modifier to indicate that implicit conversions into that type should always be allowed.\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that the warning displayed in the video appears only if Compiler-Based Highlighting is enabled.\nYou can read more about the into modifier in the Scala 3 documentation.\n\n\n\n\nScala 3.8 requires JDK 17+\nIn the new Scala release, the minimum required JDK version has been updated to 17. The latest version of the Scala plugin supports this requirement in two ways:\nIn the New Project Wizard: If you select Scala 3.8+ or newer, but choose a JDK version older than 17, a warning popup that reads “JDK >= 17 is required with Scala 3.8” will appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn existing projects: If your Scala project or any of its modules requires Scala 3.8+ but is being compiled on a JDK version lower than 17, IntelliJ IDEA will display a special warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Better fors”\n“Better fors” might sound a bit awkward for a feature name, but it introduces a significant and long-anticipated syntax relaxation for Scala’s for-comprehensions. Previously, a for-comprehension had to start with a generator, such as number <- List(1, 2, 3). If you wanted to use an alias, like list = List(1, 2, 3), you had to place it after a generator or define it before the entire for-comprehension and save the result as a value. Now, Scala 3.8 and the Scala plugin support having just the alias before a generator and transforming it into a value automatically. \n\n\n\n\n\nBasic support for capture checking\nThe Scala standard library is now compiled and published using Scala 3. You can see it in the Project view of a Scala 3.8 project. Simply scroll down and unfold the following path: External Libraries | sbt:org.scala-lang.scala-library-3.8.0:jar | scala-lang.scala-library-3.8.0:jar. There, you can find and open standard library source files, for example IterableOnce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see in the screenshots, the code in the Scala 3.8 version of this class already uses one of the new features: capture checking. Currently, the Scala plugin only supports basic syntax for capture checking, and even this support is experimental. Our goal was to enable you to navigate the Scala standard library code without encountering error highlighting, view type information for captures, and jump to their declarations.\n\n\n\n\nThe runtimeChecked method\nThe runtimeChecked method is an extension method defined in scala.Predef that can be called on any expression. When an expression ends with .runtimeChecked, it is exempt from certain static checks in the compiler, such as pattern match exhaustivity. The Scala plugin supports this feature out of the box. For example, if you write a pattern match that misses some cases – as in the screenshot below that defines all days of the week, but then uses only five of them in a match case – the Scala plugin displays a warning that the pattern matching is not exhaustive. If you decorate the value used for pattern matching with .runtimeChecked, the warning will not be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nThe features highlighted in this article are where the Scala plugin’s support is most visible to users. However, there are numerous other changes we’ve made in preparation for the Scala 3.8 release. In the near future, we will continue to improve our Scala 3 support, including some of the new Scala 3.8 features. Expect more updates in the form of blog posts, release notes, and videos.\nThe features highlighted in this article are where the Scala plugin’s support is most visible to users.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Global Project Configuration is a new feature that helps Qodana users manage linter settings across an entire organization or team – all from one location. Until now, maintaining consistent code quality rules meant updating configuration profiles in every individual repository. \nWhether you were approving new licenses, adjusting rule severity, or defining custom patterns for hardcoded passwords, changes had to be repeated manually across multiple projects. However, as organizations scale, this approach becomes slow, error-prone, and difficult to audit.\nGlobal Project Configuration solves this. It provides a streamlined, reusable, organization-wide mechanism for defining and enforcing code quality standards – without limiting the flexibility individual projects may need.\nBook Demo\nWhy Global Project Configuration matters\nWith this new capability, you can:\nEstablish organization-wide standards once, and apply them everywhere.\nEnforce best practices without sacrificing project-specific adjustments.\nApply and update rules at scale, instantly affecting any linked projects.\nReduce duplication and manual overhead, especially for large repositories or distributed teams.\nImprove consistency across teams, languages, and tech stacks.\nThis makes Qodana easier to manage, more adaptable to real-world work, and much more scalable.\nHow it works\nGlobal Project Configuration is powered by a dedicated repository in which your organization stores the configuration files to be used during Qodana analysis. You can structure this repository in a way that suits your workflow, organizing configurations logically and referencing others to encourage reuse.\n\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring for teams: A practical example\nLet’s look at how different teams might take advantage of this feature.\nImagine your organization creates a global Base configuration containing universal coding standards shared across all teams. From there:\nTeam A, which uses Lombok in Java development, inherits from Base and adds stricter Lombok-related rules. They apply this configuration only to their own projects.\nTeam B, maintaining a legacy project, inherits from Base but disables most checks except for security rules. This allows them to focus on critical issues without being overwhelmed by unrelated warnings.\nEach team tailors the standards to their needs – while still aligning with the organization’s overall quality strategy.\nApplying configurations to projects\nOnce a project is linked to a configuration:\nQodana automatically applies it on the next run.\nAny changes pushed to the configuration repository are picked up and applied seamlessly.\nYou can view all configurations and their associated projects in the Qodana Cloud UI, making management transparent and intuitive.\nEverything is centralized, traceable, and easy to maintain.\nGet started with Qodana’s Global Project Configuration\n\nVisit Qodana Cloud → Settings → Global Configurations in the product, or view our documentation for a full guide on creating the configuration repository, syncing it with Qodana Cloud, and linking configurations to specific projects.\nView Setup",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "JPA를 사용하다 보면 대량의 데이터를 삽입해야 하는 상황에서 saveAll의 성능 한계에 부딪히게 됩니다. 이번 포스팅에서는 JPA saveAll의 성능 이슈를 살펴보고, QueryDSL의 SQLQueryFactory를 활용한 Batch Insert로 성능을 획기적으로 개선하는 방법을 소개합니다.\n개요#\n대량의 데이터를 데이터베이스에 저장해야 할 때, 일반적으로 JPA의 saveAll 메서드를 사용합니다. 하지만 데이터의 양이 늘어날수록 saveAll의 처리 속도는 급격히 느려질 수 있습니다. 특히 ID 생성 전략이 IDENTITY인 경우, JPA는 Batch Insert를 지원하지 않아 단건으로 Insert 쿼리가 실행되는 문제가 있습니다.\n이전 포스팅(Spring Batch에서 Exposed를 이용한 Batch Insert)에서 Exposed를 활용한 성능 개선 방법을 소개한 적이 있습니다. 하지만 오직 Batch Insert만을 위해 JPA 환경에 Exposed라는 새로운 ORM을 도입하고 혼합해서 사용하는 것은 설정의 복잡함이나 학습 곡선 측면에서 비효율적일 수 있습니다.\n만약 이미 프로젝트에서 JPA와 QueryDSL을 사용하고 있다면, 추가적인 ORM 도입 없이 QueryDSL-SQL 모듈을 활용하여 Type-Safe하게 Batch Insert를 구현할 수 있습니다. 이번 포스팅에서는 그 방법을 소개합니다.\nJPA saveAll의 성능 이슈#\nJPA(Hibernate)는 엔티티의 ID 생성 전략이 @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)로 설정되어 있을 때, JDBC 레벨의 Batch Insert를 비활성화합니다. 이는 영속성 컨텍스트가 엔티티를 관리하기 위해 Insert 즉시 ID 값을 알아야 하기 때문입니다. 결과적으로 1,000개의 데이터를 저장하면 1,000번의 Insert 쿼리가 데이터베이스로 전송되어 성능 저하의 주원인이 됩니다.\n일반적인 JPA의 saveAll 사용 코드는 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n@Transactional\nfun saveAllWriters(writers: List<Writer>) {\n    writerRepository.saveAll(writers)\n}\n\n\n위 코드는 사용하기 매우 편리하지만, 대량의 데이터를 처리할 때는 각 엔티티마다 개별적인 Insert 쿼리가 발생하여 네트워크 오버헤드와 데이터베이스 처리 비용이 증가하게 됩니다.\nQueryDSL Batch Insert 구현#\nQueryDSL-SQL 모듈을 사용하면 JPA 엔티티가 아닌 JDBC 레벨에서 직접 SQL을 구성하여 실행할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 addBatch 기능을 활용한 Bulk Insert를 구현할 수 있습니다.\n의존성 설정#\nQueryDSL-SQL을 사용하기 위해 build.gradle.kts에 아래 의존성을 추가합니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\ndependencies {\n    // QueryDSL JPA (기본 사용)\n    implementation(\"com.querydsl:querydsl-jpa:5.1.0:jakarta\")\n\n    // QueryDSL SQL (Batch Insert를 위해 필요)\n    implementation(\"com.querydsl:querydsl-sql:5.1.0\")\n}\n\n\nQueryDSL-SQL 소개:\nQueryDSL-SQL은 JPA 엔티티 모델이 아닌 데이터베이스 스키마를 기반으로 쿼리를 작성할 수 있게 해주는 모듈입니다. JPA가 제공하지 않는 세밀한 SQL 제어(예: Batch Insert, 특정 벤더 전용 구문 등)가 필요할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있습니다. SQLQueryFactory를 통해 JDBC 레벨의 기능을 Type-Safe하게 사용할 수 있도록 도와줍니다.\n구현 코드 예시#\nSQLQueryFactory를 사용하여 Batch Insert를 구현하는 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n@Service\nclass BatchInsertService(\n    private val dataSource: DataSource\n) {\n    @Transactional\n    fun executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(writers: List<Writer>): Long {\n        // 1. 테이블 메타데이터 정의\n        val writerTable = RelationalPathBase(Writer::class.java, \"writer\", null, \"writer\")\n        // 2. SQLQueryFactory 생성 (MySQL 템플릿 사용)\n        val sqlQueryFactory = SQLQueryFactory(Configuration(MySQLTemplates()), dataSource)\n        val insert = sqlQueryFactory.insert(writerTable)\n        // 3. 데이터를 Batch에 추가\n        for (writer in writers) {\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.name, writer.name)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.email, writer.email)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.score, 1)\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.reputation, 1.toDouble())\n            insert.set(QWriter.writer.active, true)\n            insert.addBatch() // 메모리에 쿼리 적재\n        }\n\n        // 4. 일괄 실행\n        return insert.execute()\n    }\n}\n\n\n코드 설명\n\nRelationalPathBase: SQL 쿼리 작성을 위해 대상 테이블의 메타데이터를 정의합니다.\naddBatch(): 루프를 돌며 데이터를 즉시 Insert 하지 않고, JDBC의 Batch 기능을 활용하기 위해 메모리에 쿼리 파라미터들을 쌓아둡니다.\nexecute(): 쌓여있는 Batch 쿼리를 데이터베이스로 한 번에 전송하여 실행합니다.\n\nMySQL 최적화 옵션: rewriteBatchedStatements#\nMySQL을 사용하는 경우, JDBC 연결 URL에 rewriteBatchedStatements=true 옵션을 반드시 추가해야 합니다.\n\n\n1\n\njdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb?rewriteBatchedStatements=true\n\n\n이 옵션이 필요한 이유:\n기본적으로 MySQL JDBC 드라이버는 addBatch()로 들어온 쿼리들을 개별적인 Insert 구문으로 전송합니다. 하지만 이 옵션을 활성화하면 드라이버 레벨에서 여러 개의 Insert 구문을 하나의 INSERT INTO ... VALUES (...), (...), (...) 형태의 Multi-Value Insert 구문으로 재작성(Rewrite)하여 전송합니다. 이를 통해 네트워크 패킷 수를 획기적으로 줄이고 데이터베이스의 파싱 비용을 절감하여 성능을 극대화할 수 있습니다.\n성능 비교#\n성능 측정 코드#\n정확한 성능 측정을 위해 saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch의 실행 시간을 각각 측정했습니다.\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n\n    @Test\nfun `saveAll test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            writerRepository.saveAll(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 saveAll 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n@Test\nfun `executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql test`() {\n    val rowsList = listOf(100, 200, 500, 1_000, 2_000, 5_000, 10_000)\n    val iterations = 5\n\n    rowsList.forEach { rows ->\n        var totalTimeMillis = 0.0\n        for (i in 1..iterations) {\n            val uniqueWriters = (1..rows).map {\n                Writer(name = \"name-$i-$it\", email = \"email-$i-$it\")\n            }\n\n            val stopWatch = StopWatch()\n            stopWatch.start()\n            batchInsertService.executeBulkInsertWritersWithSql(uniqueWriters)\n            stopWatch.stop()\n\n            if (i > 1) { // 첫 회차 제외\n                totalTimeMillis += stopWatch.totalTimeMillis\n            }\n        }\n        val averageTimeMillis = totalTimeMillis / (iterations - 1)\n        println(\"$rows 건 QueryDSL Batch Insert 평균 실행 시간: ${averageTimeMillis} ms\")\n    }\n}\n\n\n측정 방식 설명\n\n반복 측정: 각 데이터 구간(100건 ~ 10,000건)마다 총 5회 반복하여 측정했습니다.\nWarm-up 고려: 테스트 실행 시 첫 번째 회차는 결과에서 제외했습니다. 이는 데이터베이스 커넥션 풀(Connection Pool)에서 커넥션을 처음 생성하는 초기 비용 등 초기화 작업에 소요되는 시간이 포함되어 결과가 왜곡되는 것을 방지하기 위함입니다.\n평균값 산출: 첫 회차를 제외한 나머지 4회의 실행 시간을 합산하여 평균값을 산출함으로써 보다 신뢰성 있는 성능 데이터를 얻었습니다.\n\n성능 측정 결과#\n\nJPA saveAll과 QueryDSL addBatch를 사용했을 때의 성능 차이를 비교한 결과입니다. 데이터 개수가 늘어날수록 성능 차이가 확연하게 벌어지는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\nrowssaveAll (ms)add batch (ms)성능 개선율\n\n1001041288.50%\n200174.51690.80%\n500370.2527.592.60%\n1,0006955691.90%\n2,0001,5746895.70%\n5,0003,77814096.30%\n10,0007,50526596.50%\n\n\nsaveAll: JPA Repository의 saveAll 메서드 사용\nadd batch: QueryDSL SQLQueryFactory의 addBatch 사용\n\n10,000건 기준으로 약 96.5%의 성능 개선 효과가 있었습니다. saveAll이 약 7.5초 걸리는 작업을 Batch Insert로는 0.26초 만에 처리할 수 있습니다.\n결론#\n대량의 데이터를 처리해야 하는 배치성 작업이나 초기 데이터 적재 시에는 JPA의 saveAll보다는 JDBC Batch Insert를 사용하는 것이 필수적입니다.\n특히, 오직 Batch Insert 성능 개선만을 위해 Exposed와 같은 새로운 ORM을 도입하는 것은 프로젝트의 복잡도를 높일 수 있습니다. 이미 JPA와 QueryDSL을 사용 중인 환경이라면, QueryDSL-SQL을 활용하는 것이 추가적인 학습 곡선이나 설정의 번거로움 없이 Type-Safe하게 성능을 극대화할 수 있는 가장 효율적인 대안입니다.\n프로젝트에서 대량 Insert가 필요한 구간이 있다면, 별도의 라이브러리 추가 없이 QueryDSL-SQL을 통해 성능과 생산성을 동시에 챙겨보시기를 권장합니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "여러분은 브레인스토밍을 할 때 막막함을 느끼시나요? 방대한 아이디어가 필요한데 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 모르겠다고요? 2026년, 이제 ChatGPT는 단순한 정보 제공자를 넘어 여러분의 '생각의 수준'을 한 차원 높여줄 유능한 브레인스토밍 파트너가 될 수 있습니다. 오늘은 제가 직접 사용하며 효과를 본, 창의적인 사고를 돕는 8가지 ChatGPT 프롬프트를 공개합니다. 평범한 아이디어를 벗어나 실용적이고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 얻고 싶은 분들을 위해 준비했어요.\n\n\n솔직히 말하면, 우리는 ChatGPT를 너무 쉽게 생각하는 경향이 있는 것 같아요. 그냥 질문을 던지면 답을 뱉어내는 '아이디어 자판기'처럼 말이죠. 하지만 제가 직접 겪어보니, 제대로 활용하면 정말 놀라운 '브레인스토밍 파트너'가 될 수 있다는 걸 깨달았습니다. 우리가 머리를 쥐어짜며 생각의 흐름을 만들 때, ChatGPT는 그 아이디어의 볼륨과 구조를 잡아주는 역할을 톡톡히 해내죠. 제가 오랫동안 마케팅과 웹 개발 분야에서 일하며 숱하게 브레인스토밍을 해왔는데, 최근 챗GPT와 함께하면서 아이디어의 명확성과 범위가 확연히 넓어지는 것을 경험하고 있습니다. 수많은 선배들의 지혜와 레딧 같은 커뮤니티에서 얻은 영감을 바탕으로, 퍼져 있던 생각들을 실행 가능한 아이디어로 다듬는 데 최적화된 프롬프트 8가지를 소개할게요. 저의 뉴스레터를 장기적으로 흥미롭게 유지하는 방법이라는 주제로 같이 고민해보면 더 와닿으실 거예요.\n1. 맥락을 이해시키는 것부터 시작하세요: 일반적인 아이디어를 피하는 첫걸음\n아무리 인공지능이라도 우리 마음을 꿰뚫어 볼 수는 없잖아요? 그래서 저는 항상 브레인스토밍 세션을 시작하기 전에 ChatGPT에게 명확한 지침을 줍니다. 마치 유능한 팀원에게 프로젝트 브리핑을 하듯이요. 이 '핵심 프롬프트'는 전체 대화의 틀을 잡고, 챗GPT가 뻔하거나 피상적인 아이디어를 내놓는 걸 미리 방지해 주는 역할을 해요. 복잡한 콘텐츠 기획이나 개인적인 목표 설정 같은 작업에 특히 유용하더라고요. 처음부터 이렇게 세부적으로 조율해두면 나중에 불필요한 노력을 훨씬 줄일 수 있습니다. 핵심은 맥락, 명확성, 그리고 의도라는 점, 잊지 마세요!\n  프롬프트 활용 팁:\nGoal(목표): 최종적으로 무엇을 얻고 싶은지 명확히 하세요.\nContext(맥락): 대상, 제약 조건, 시간, 자원 등 배경 정보를 상세히 설명하세요.\nProcess(과정): 어떤 방식으로 진행할지 (예: 질문 개수, 프레임워크 제안 등) 구체적으로 알려주세요.\n당신은 저의 구조화된 브레인스토밍 파트너입니다.\n목표: [주제/문제/결과물 설명]에 대해 브레인스토밍하는 것을 도와주세요.\n맥락: [대상, 제약 조건, 기한, 자원].\n과정: 최대 5개의 명확화 질문을 하나씩 해주세요.\n사용할 수 있는 3-5가지의 다른 브레인스토밍 프레임워크를 제안해주세요 (예: SCAMPER, 마인드맵, 가정, 제약, 첫 번째 원칙).\n제가 하나를 선택하면, 간결하고 번호가 매겨진 목록으로 브레인스토밍을 안내해주세요. 이때 구체성과 실용성을 목표로 합니다.\n궁극적으로, 최고의 아이디어를 3-5가지 테마로 분류하고 구체적인 다음 단계를 제안해주세요.\n간결한 글머리 기호를 사용하고 일반적인 조언은 피해주세요.\n        \n2. 다양한 아이디어로 물꼬를 트세요: 양으로 승부하는 발산적 사고\n아이디어가 막힐 때 가장 빠르고 확실한 방법은 일단 많은 아이디어를 쏟아내는 것이라고 생각해요. 심지어 좀 터무니없는 아이디어라도 괜찮아요! 초기 단계에서는 아이디어의 질보다는 속도와 범위가 훨씬 중요합니다. 이 프롬프트는 ChatGPT와 우리 뇌의 시동을 거는 역할을 해요. 나중에 걸러내고 우선순위를 정하는 건 그때 가서 해도 늦지 않습니다.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시:\n뉴스레터의 메인 콘텐츠를 짧은 숏폼 비디오로 전환 (요즘 대세죠!)\n구독자들이 직접 참여하는 '익명 고민 상담소' 코너 운영\n매주 다른 분야의 전문가를 초대해 인터뷰 시리즈 진행\n프롬프트의 마지막 단계가 정말 중요해요. '가장 유망한 아이디어 5가지 표시'가 없다면, 그냥 방치되는 목록으로 끝나버릴 수도 있거든요. 번호가 매겨진 목록은 나중에 특정 아이디어를 참조할 때도 편리하고요. 개인적인 경험으로는, 종종 목록의 뒷부분에 숨어있는 기발한 아이디어들이 많았습니다. ChatGPT와 마인드맵 도구를 함께 사용하면 아이디어 간의 연관성을 찾는 데 큰 도움이 될 거예요.\n\n\n\n[주제]에 대해 발산적 브레인스토밍을 해봅시다.\n제약 조건: [예산/시간/산업/대상/기타].\n1단계: 명확한 것부터 파격적인 것까지 20가지의 빠르고 대략적인 아이디어를 번호가 매겨진 목록으로 생성해주세요.\n2단계: 각 아이디어에 대해 왜 효과적일 수 있는지에 대한 짧은 문구를 추가해주세요.\n3단계: 영향력 대비 노력 측면에서 가장 유망해 보이는 5가지 아이디어를 표시해주세요.\n        \n3. 역 브레인스토밍으로 숨겨진 문제점 찾기: 실패를 통해 성공 배우기\n생각해보니, 성공하는 방법만 고민할 필요는 없더라고요. 역 브레인스토밍(Reverse Brainstorming)은 문제를 뒤집어서 '어떻게 하면 실패할 수 있을까?'를 묻는 기법입니다. 마치 일이 터지기 전에 미리 사후 검토(Pre-mortem)를 하는 것과 비슷하죠. 저는 이 프롬프트를 통해 어떤 아이디어가 '괜찮긴 한데 뭔가 부족하다'고 느껴질 때 그 이유를 파악하는 데 활용합니다.\n⚠️ 뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (역발상):\n문제: 뉴스레터 이탈률을 높이는 방법은?\n해결책: 과도한 광고 삽입 (뒤집으면: 광고를 최소화하고 콘텐츠 집중)\n해결책: 매주 비슷한 내용만 반복 (뒤집으면: 다양한 형식과 주제로 신선함 유지)\n해결책: 발행 주기를 불규칙하게 (뒤집으면: 일관된 발행 주기 유지)\n이 프롬프트는 약한 아이디어와 흔한 실수를 빠르게 파악하게 해줘요. 만약 아이디어가 너무 일반적이라 실패한다면, 더 틈새시장을 노리는 것이 해결책이 될 수 있고, 너무 복잡해서 실패한다면 간단하게 만드는 것이 답이 될 수 있죠. 정말 유용한 전략입니다!\n[주제]에 대해 역 브레인스토밍을 사용하세요.\n이 문제를 악화시킬 수 있는 15가지 방법을 나열하세요.\n각각의 \"악화\" 아이디어를 건설적인 아이디어 또는 보호 장치로 전환하세요.\n전환된 목록을 구체적이고 테스트 가능한 행동 또는 개념으로 제시하세요.\n        \n4. 무작위 단어로 상상력 점프하기: 기발한 연결고리 만들기\n모든 아이디어가 비슷하게 들리기 시작할 때, 저는 가끔 '무작위성'의 도움을 받아요. 예전에는 사전을 펼치거나 신문을 보면서 뜬금없는 단어에서 영감을 얻기도 했죠. 이 프롬프트는 전혀 관련 없어 보이는 입력값들을 한데 모아 새로운 연결고리를 찾도록 강제합니다. 아, 그런데 이거 뇌세포에 정말 무리가 갈 때도 있어요... 그래서 챗GPT가 이렇게 도움이 될 줄은 몰랐네요!\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (무작위 단어: '나무'):\n은유: 나무의 나이테처럼 구독자들의 성장 과정을 담는 콘텐츠 시리즈 기획\n제약: '나무'라는 단어의 의미를 벗어나지 않게 친환경, 지속 가능성 테마의 콘텐츠만 다루기\n관점: 뉴스레터를 '지식의 숲'으로 비유하여 구독자들이 각자 나무를 심고 가꾸는 커뮤니티 조성\n사실 무작위 단어 그 자체는 중요하지 않아요. 중요한 건 그 단어들을 은유, 제약, 또는 평소에는 고려하지 않았을 관점으로 번역하는 과정에서 가치가 생긴다는 점입니다. 정말 신기하죠?!\n[주제]에 대한 창의적이고 명확하지 않은 아이디어를 원합니다.\n1단계: 무작위의 관련 없는 트리거 단어 5개를 생성하세요.\n2단계: 각 단어에 대해 아이디어를 영감을 주거나 수정할 수 있는 세 가지 방법을 보여주세요.\n3단계: 도출된 가장 흥미로운 방향 5가지를 요약하세요.\n        \n5. SCAMPER 프레임워크로 체계적인 사고 확장하기\n에드워드 드 보노(Edward de Bono)가 측면 사고(Lateral Thinking)를 대중화시켰죠. SCAMPER는 측면 사고를 위한 고전적인 창의성 프레임워크인데, AI와 함께 사용하면 정말 눈부시게 빠릅니다! 이 프레임워크는 특정 아이디어를 다양한 각도에서 질문하고 변형하며 새로운 가능성을 탐색하도록 돕습니다.\n요소\n의미\n뉴스레터 아이디어 예시\n\n\n\n\nSubstitute\n대체하기\n텍스트 콘텐츠를 짧은 오디오 클립으로 대체\n\n\nCombine\n결합하기\n주간 칼럼과 독자 Q&A 코너를 결합하여 '전문가에게 묻다' 시리즈\n\n\nAdapt\n적응하기\n타 산업의 성공적인 콘텐츠 전략을 뉴스레터에 적용\n\n\nModify\n수정/확대/축소\n메인 칼럼의 길이를 확 줄이고 대신 인포그래픽으로 시각화\n\n\nPut to other uses\n다른 용도로 활용\n뉴스레터 콘텐츠를 활용해 소셜 미디어 카드뉴스 제작\n\n\nEliminate\n제거하기\n모든 광고 제거, 오직 순수 콘텐츠에만 집중\n\n\nReverse\n뒤집기/재배열\n결론을 먼저 보여주고 그 이유를 설명하는 콘텐츠 구성\n\n\n\n\n\n이 프롬프트는 이미 어느 정도 구체화된 아이디어에 적용할 때 빛을 발합니다. 그래서 저는 브레인스토밍 과정의 후반부에 이 프롬프트를 사용하는 편이에요. 특정 기능을 제거하거나 두 가지 요소를 결합하는 것 같은 작은 변화가 아이디어의 명확성이나 유용성을 극적으로 향상시키는 것을 자주 경험할 수 있을 겁니다.\nSCAMPER 프레임워크를 사용하여 [제품/프로젝트/주제]에 대해 브레인스토밍하세요.\n각 요소(Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse)에 대해:\n일반적인 조언이 아닌 3-5가지 구체적인 아이디어를 생성하세요.\n각 아이디어를 한 문장으로 유지하세요.\n모든 SCAMPER 단계에서 가장 좋은 아이디어 5가지의 짧은 목록으로 마무리하세요.\n        \n6. SWOT 분석으로 아이디어를 현실에 대입하기: 전략적 점검\n아이디어가 아무리 좋아 보여도 현실성이 없으면 무용지물이잖아요? SWOT 분석 스타일의 프롬프트는 브레인스토밍을 현실 세계로 끌어와 앞으로 발생할 수 있는 상충 관계(Trade-offs)를 미리 보여줍니다. 저는 종종 이 프롬프트를 통해 '보기에는 좋은 아이디어'가 실질적으로 어떤 문제점을 안고 있는지 파악하고 싶을 때 사용하곤 해요.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (SWOT):\n강점 활용: '전문가 인터뷰' 강점을 살려 해당 분야 최고 권위자를 초빙하는 특별 시리즈 기획\n약점 보완: '콘텐츠 제작 시간 부족' 약점을 해결하기 위해 구독자 참여형 콘텐츠 비중 확대\n기회 포착: '트렌드 변화' 기회를 활용해 AI 기술 트렌드를 빠르게 분석하는 섹션 신설\n위협 방어: '경쟁사 증가' 위협에 대비해 뉴스레터만의 독점적인 커뮤니티 기능 강화\n이 분석을 통해 얻은 통찰력은 아이디어의 질을 높이고 실행력을 개선하는 데 결정적인 역할을 합니다. 시각적인 다이어그램 도구를 함께 사용하면 아이디어를 한눈에 파악하는 데 더욱 효과적일 거예요. 솔직히 말해서, 이 과정 없이는 뭔가 중요한 걸 놓치고 있는 느낌이 들 때가 많아요.\n[아이디어 또는 프로젝트]에 대해 SWOT 방식의 브레인스토밍 세션을 실행하세요.\n5-7가지 강점, 5-7가지 약점, 5-7가지 기회, 5-7가지 위협을 나열하세요.\n이것들로부터 다음을 나열하세요:\n강점을 두 배로 활용하는 아이디어 3가지\n약점을 고치거나 우회하는 아이디어 3가지\n기회를 포착하는 아이디어 3가지\n위협에 대비하는 아이디어 3가지\n모든 것을 간결한 글머리 기호로 제시하세요.\n        \n7. 역할극으로 다양한 관점 얻기: 미처 몰랐던 니즈 발굴\n우리는 모두 자기만의 시각에 갇히기 쉬워요. 역할극 브레인스토밍(Rolestorming)은 다른 사람의 입장이 되어 생각해보는 기법인데, 제품이나 프로세스의 페인 포인트(Pain Point)를 찾는 데 정말 탁월한 효과를 발휘합니다. 내가 미처 생각하지 못했던 필요나 개선점들을 발견하게 해주거든요.\n  뉴스레터 아이디어 적용 예시 (페르소나):\n초보 사용자: '용어가 너무 어려워요. 초보자를 위한 쉬운 설명이나 용어 사전이 필요해요.'\n파워 사용자: '심화 자료나 다른 전문가와의 네트워킹 기회가 있으면 좋겠어요.'\n경쟁사: '이 뉴스레터는 특정 주제에 대한 심층 분석이 부족하고, 인터랙티브 요소가 약해.'\n작가로서, 저는 이 프롬프트 덕분에 다양한 독자층의 니즈를 파악하고 콘텐츠를 미세 조정하는 데 큰 도움을 받았습니다. 여러 페르소나에서 공통적으로 발견되는 인사이트는 콘텐츠를 더 넓은 독자층에 맞게 다듬는 데 정말 핵심적이라고 할 수 있죠. 아마 여러분도 이 과정을 통해 예상치 못한 보물을 발견하실 거예요.\n[주제]에 대해 \"역할 브레인스토밍\"을 할 것입니다.\n다음 관점에서 생각하세요:\n– 초보자\n– 파워 사용자\n– 주요 이해관계자\n– 경쟁사\n각 페르소나에 대해 그들이 주장할 5가지 아이디어, 요청 또는 개선 사항을 나열하세요.\n그리고 최고의 아이디어를 하나의 우선순위 목록으로 통합하세요.\n        \n8. 아이디어를 실행 가능한 로드맵으로 전환하기: 실질적인 계획\n브레인스토밍이 아무리 멋진 아이디어를 쏟아냈어도, 그것들이 그냥 문서 속에서 잠들어버린다면 아무 소용이 없겠죠? 이 프롬프트는 아이디어를 실제 행동으로 옮길 수 있는 구체적인 로드맵으로 전환시켜 줍니다. 단순히 직감에만 의존하는 것이 아니라, 영향력(Impact)과 노력(Effort)을 기준으로 아이디어를 평가하게 함으로써 가장 효과적인 계획을 세울 수 있도록 도와줘요. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 최상의 아이디어는 직감과 어느 정도의 객관적인 증거 사이의 균형에서 나온다고 생각합니다.\n  아이디어 분류 기준:\nQuick wins (빠른 성과): 적은 노력으로 큰 영향력을 낼 수 있는 아이디어\nLong bets (장기 투자): 큰 노력이 필요하지만 장기적으로 엄청난 영향력을 가져올 아이디어\nExperiments (실험): 시도해 볼 만하지만 불확실성이 있는 아이디어\nCancel (취소): 영향력은 낮고 노력은 많이 드는 비효율적인 아이디어\n\n\n제대로 된 브레인스토밍의 마지막은 항상 실행 가능한 계획이어야 한다고 생각해요. 챗GPT와 함께라면 이런 과정도 훨씬 체계적이고 효율적으로 진행할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 뉴스레터 관련 아이디어 3가지에 대해 2주간의 실행 계획을 세우는 거죠. 정말 생산적이지 않나요?\n제가 제공하는 아이디어 목록을 실용적인 실행 로드맵으로 전환하세요.\n각 아이디어를 영향력(1-5)과 노력(1-5) 기준으로 평가하고 간략한 설명을 덧붙이세요.\n이를 빠른 성과(Quick wins), 장기 투자(Long bets), 실험(Experiments), 취소(Cancel)로 분류하세요.\n최고의 아이디어 3개를 테스트하기 위한 구체적인 작업이 포함된 2주 실행 계획을 제안하세요.\n        \n생산적인 브레인스토밍은 단순히 더 좋은 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 우리 자신의 맹점(Blind Spots)을 이해하는 과정이기도 합니다. 모든 프롬프트를 다 사용할 필요는 없어요 (물론 다 사용하면 좋긴 합니다!). 초기 설정 프롬프트로 시작한 뒤, 발산적 프롬프트 하나와 SWOT 분석 같은 '아이디어 검증용' 프롬프트를 조합해보세요. 아마 생각지도 못했던 명확성의 비약적인 상승을 경험하게 될 겁니다. 2026년, ChatGPT와 함께 여러분의 생각의 지평을 더욱 넓혀나가시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1. 명확한 컨텍스트 설정: ChatGPT에게 구체적인 목표와 제약 조건을 미리 알려 일반적인 답변을 방지하세요.\n2. 다양한 사고 확장: 발산적 사고, 역 브레인스토밍, 무작위 단어, SCAMPER를 활용해 사고의 폭을 넓히세요.\n3. 아이디어 현실 점검: SWOT 분석과 역할극을 통해 아이디어의 강점, 약점, 기회, 위협을 파악하고 다양한 관점을 통합하세요.\n4. 실행 가능한 로드맵: 아이디어를 영향력과 노력 기준으로 평가하고, 단기 성과, 장기 투자, 실험, 취소 항목으로 분류하여 구체적인 실행 계획을 세우세요.\n  이 프롬프트들을 활용하면 여러분의 브레인스토밍이 훨씬 더 깊고 실용적으로 변할 거예요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: ChatGPT 브레인스토밍 프롬프트를 사용할 때 가장 중요한 점은 무엇인가요?\n가장 중요한 건 명확한 컨텍스트와 목표를 설정하는 거예요. ChatGPT를 단순한 아이디어 자동판매기가 아닌, 구조화된 브레인스토밍 파트너로 생각하고 구체적인 지침을 제공할수록 훨씬 더 유용하고 깊이 있는 결과를 얻을 수 있답니다. 마치 유능한 팀원에게 정확한 프로젝트 브리핑을 하는 것과 비슷하다고 보면 돼요!\nQ2: 여러 프롬프트를 어떻게 조합해서 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\n저는 보통 초기 설정 프롬프트(#1)로 시작해서, 발산적 사고를 위한 프롬프트(#2)로 아이디어의 양을 늘려요. 그 다음, 역 브레인스토밍(#3)이나 SWOT 분석(#6) 같은 '검증용' 프롬프트로 아이디어를 점검하죠. 이렇게 하면 초기 아이디어의 맹점을 파악하고 보완할 수 있어서 정말 도움이 된답니다. 상황에 따라 SCAMPER(#5)나 역할극(#7)을 추가해서 더 깊이 있는 아이디어를 발굴하기도 해요.\nQ3: ChatGPT가 생성한 아이디어가 너무 일반적일 때는 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n음, 이런 경우도 자주 있죠! 그럴 때는 먼저 컨텍스트를 더 구체적으로 설명하는 게 좋아요. 예를 들어, \"이 아이디어를 20대 여성 직장인을 위한 뉴스레터에 적용한다면?\" 같이 대상 독자나 특정 상황을 더 명확히 제시하는 거죠. 그리고 역 브레인스토밍(#3)을 통해 '어떻게 하면 이 아이디어를 망칠 수 있을까?'를 고민해보면, 의외로 신선한 해결책이 나올 때가 많아요.\nQ4: 이 프롬프트들을 어디에 활용하면 가장 효과적일까요?\n개인적으로는 콘텐츠 기획, 마케팅 전략 수립, 제품 개발 아이디어 도출, 개인적인 목표 설정 등 다양한 분야에서 활용도가 높았어요. 특히 혼자서 막막할 때나 팀원들과 새로운 시각이 필요할 때 ChatGPT를 유능한 동료 삼아 이 프롬프트들을 적용해보면, 생각지도 못한 인사이트를 얻을 수 있을 거예요.\n\n\n        {\n          \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n          \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n          \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n              \"@type\": \"Question\",\n              \"name\": \"ChatGPT 브레인스토밍 프롬프트를 사용할 때 가장 중요한 점은 무엇인가요?\",\n              \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                \"text\": \"가장 중요한 건 명확한 컨텍스트와 목표를 설정하는 거예요.

ChatGPT Plus: 대화형 AI의 기준을 높이다  \n혹시 AI 챗봇을 사용해보고는 기대 이하였다고 실망한 적 있으신가요? 아마 여러분만 그런 것은 아닐 거예요. 무료 버전의 챗봇들은 보통 느린 속도, 기본 모델, 사용량 제한, 그리고 한정된 기능을 제공하기 마련이죠. 저 역시 몇 주 동안 ChatGPT 무료 버전을 사용했습니다. 주로 아이디어를 브레인스토밍하고, 복잡한 정보를 요약하고, 일정을 계획하거나, 새로운 쇼핑 리서치 기능을 시도하는 데 사용했죠.\n몇 주간 사용한 후, 저는 ChatGPT Plus로 업그레이드를 결정했습니다. 이미 많은 친구들이 사용하며 만족하고 있었거든요. 그리고 Plus 버전으로 전환했을 때, 단순히 업그레이드를 넘어선 완전히 새로운 경험이라는 것을 깨달았습니다. 정말 게임 체인저였어요.\nChatGPT Plus, 왜 전문가들의 선택일까요?\n월 20달러라는 합리적인 비용으로, 여러분은 더 나은 추론 능력을 가진 최첨단 ChatGPT 5 모델에 접근할 수 있게 됩니다. 이 모델은 복잡한 프롬프트를 훨씬 더 잘 처리하고, 맥락을 정확하게 이해하며, 더 스마트하고 신뢰할 수 있는 답변을 제공합니다. 게다가 피크 시간대에 대기할 필요 없이 우선적인 접근 권한을 얻어 더 빠른 응답을 받을 수 있습니다.\n무엇보다 ChatGPT Plus는 더 나은 설명, 뛰어난 지원, 그리고 창의적인 답변을 제공하는 데 탁월합니다. 비즈니스 아이디어를 브레인스토밍하고 싶을 때, 코드를 디버깅해야 할 때, 답변에 창의성을 더하고 싶을 때, 또는 일상적인 작업을 자동화하고 싶을 때, ChatGPT Plus의 고급 모델은 비교할 수 없는 신뢰할 수 있는 결과를 제공할 것입니다.\n  팁: ChatGPT Plus를 사용하면 복잡한 데이터 분석, 장문의 보고서 요약, 심지어 특정 주제에 대한 심도 있는 연구까지 훨씬 빠르고 정확하게 수행할 수 있습니다. 여러분의 디지털 비서가 한 단계 더 진화하는 경험을 할 수 있을 거예요.\n\n\n2. Adobe Firefly: 창의력을 현실로, 상업적 활용까지  \n만약 여러분이 소셜 미디어 게시물, 일러스트레이션, 제품 이미지 또는 디자인 프로토타입과 같은 시각적 콘텐츠를 생성하는 사람이라면, 이미 인기 있는 생성형 이미지 도구들을 사용해봤을 가능성이 높습니다. 이들 중 많은 도구가 무료로 제공되지만, 소수의 도구만이 놀라운 수준의 창의적 제어력을 선사합니다. 저는 Google의 Nano Banana, Midjourney, Canva, 그리고 Adobe Firefly를 사용해봤고, 각기 독특한 강점과 단점을 가지고 있었죠.\n그중에서도 저에게 특히 인상 깊었던 AI 이미지 생성 도구는 바로 Adobe Firefly였습니다. Firefly는 아름다운 Pinterest 스타일의 이미지를 자유롭게 만들 수 있게 해줄 뿐만 아니라, 전문가 수준의 에셋을 제공하고 상업적으로 안전하게 사용할 수 있는 결과물을 생성해줍니다. Firefly는 가장 유능한 텍스트-이미지 생성기 중 하나로, 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 텍스트 효과까지 적용할 수 있습니다.\nFirefly의 핵심 기능과 통합의 힘\n저는 온라인 비즈니스와 소셜 미디어를 위한 몇몇 이미지를 생성해 보았는데, 결과물이 정말 마음에 들었습니다. Firefly는 여러분의 창의적인 갈증을 해소해줄 수많은 스타일을 제공합니다. Firefly의 가장 큰 장점 중 하나는 Adobe Creative Cloud와의 완벽한 통합입니다. 덕분에 Generative Fill(생성형 채우기), Generative Recolor(생성형 재색상), Generative Expand(생성형 확장)와 같은 뛰어난 기능들을 Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator 등 핵심 앱 내에서 바로 사용할 수 있습니다.\n무료 버전은 제한된 크레딧, 워터마크가 있는 결과물, 기본적인 기능만 제공하며 Adobe 앱과의 통합은 불가능합니다. 저는 무료 버전을 사용해보고 그 결과물에 너무 감탄한 나머지, 결국 프로 버전으로 업그레이드했습니다. 프로 버전은 추가 크레딧, 프리미엄 기능, Adobe 앱 통합, 그리고 ChatGPT 및 Gemini와 같은 파트너 AI 모델에 대한 접근을 가능하게 합니다.\n⚠️ 주의: 생성형 AI 이미지의 저작권 문제나 상업적 이용 가능 여부는 플랫폼마다 다릅니다. Adobe Firefly는 상업적 사용에 안전하다고 명시하고 있으나, 다른 도구를 사용할 때는 반드시 라이선스 규정을 확인해야 합니다.\n만약 여러분이 디지털 아티스트, 소셜 미디어 관리자 또는 소규모 사업자라면, Firefly의 유료 버전은 충분히 그만한 가치를 할 것입니다. 특히 기존 어도비 사용자라면 워크플로우를 혁신할 수 있는 최고의 도구가 될 거예요.\n\n\n3. Notion AI: 스마트한 작업 공간의 완성  \nNotion은 이미 강력한 디지털 워크스페이스로서 우리의 정리 정돈을 돕는 유능한 도구입니다. 여기에 Notion AI가 더해지면 여러분의 생산성은 완전히 새로운 수준으로 도약합니다. 텍스트를 생성하는 데 도움이 되는 많은 도구들이 있지만, Notion AI는 기존 Notion 워크스페이스에 통합되어 있어 훨씬 더 유용하고 손쉽게 사용할 수 있다는 장점이 있습니다.\nNotion AI는 글쓰기 도우미, AI 챗봇, 그리고 스마트 검색 엔진 역할을 한 곳에서 모두 수행합니다. 블로그 게시물 초안을 작성하거나, 아이디어를 브레인스토밍하고, 페이지를 다른 언어로 번역하는 등 훨씬 더 많은 작업을 할 수 있죠. 또한, 여러분의 워크스페이스 또는 Slack, Google Drive와 같은 연결된 앱에서 특정 질문을 할 수도 있습니다. 예를 들어, “내 최종 선정 피치는 무엇이었지?”라고 물으면, Notion AI가 최근 Slack 대화를 스캔하여 관련 결과를 가져다줄 것입니다.\nNotion AI로 달라지는 워크플로우\nNotion AI는 문서 디자인 개선을 제안하거나 PDF를 분석하여 핵심 요점을 추출해주는 데도 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 저는 몇 년 동안 Notion을 사용해왔고, 무료 버전도 상당히 관대하다고 생각했습니다. 하지만 유료 버전은 협업 도구, 무제한 파일 업로드, 우선 지원, 비공개 팀 공간 등 유용한 추가 혜택을 제공합니다.\n특히 유료 버전에서 제공되는 Notion AI는 이 워크스페이스를 단순한 아이디어 기록 공간이 아니라, 모든 업무의 파트너로 탈바꿈시켰습니다. 만약 여러분이 프리랜서, 크리에이터, 또는 작업을 정리하고 자주 협업해야 하는 사람이라면, Notion의 유료 구독에 투자하는 것은 매우 합리적인 선택이 될 것입니다.\n주요 AI 기능\n활용 예시 및 이점\n\n\n\n\n텍스트 생성 및 편집\n블로그 초안, 아이디어 브레인스토밍, 보고서 요약, 문법 교정 등을 Notion 내에서 바로 처리\n\n\n워크스페이스 질문/검색\nSlack, Google Drive 등 연동된 앱의 정보까지 통합 검색하여 필요한 정보를 빠르게 찾음\n\n\nPDF 분석 및 요약\n긴 PDF 문서의 핵심 내용을 파악하고 질문에 대한 답변을 얻어 시간 절약\n\n\n디자인 및 레이아웃 개선\nNotion 페이지의 가독성 및 시각적 매력을 높이는 AI 기반 제안 받기\n\n\n\nAI 도구, 언제 유료 버전을 선택해야 할까요?  \n피드에 뜨는 모든 AI 도구에 비용을 지불하고 싶은 유혹을 느끼는 것은 당연합니다. 하지만 신중한 접근 방식은 불필요한 디지털 혼란과 지출을 피하는 데 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 만약 여러분이 전문가이거나 AI를 계획, 글쓰기, 코딩, 또는 창의적인 워크플로우에 깊이 통합하려는 사람이라면, AI 도구에 비용을 지불하는 것이 합리적입니다.\n유료 버전은 다음과 같은 이점을 제공합니다:\n더욱 고급스러운 기능: 무료 버전에는 없는 전문가용 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다.\n강화된 보안 및 신뢰성: 민감한 데이터를 다루거나 중요한 프로젝트에 사용할 때 더욱 안심할 수 있습니다.\n고품질 결과물: 더 유능한 AI 모델에 접근하여 훨씬 정교하고 만족스러운 결과물을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n우선 지원 및 통합 혜택: 문제 발생 시 빠른 지원을 받거나 다른 서비스와의 연동성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n결론적으로, AI를 집약적으로 사용하고 고품질 결과를 얻기 위해 더 유능한 AI 모델에 접근하고 싶다면 유료 버전은 충분히 그 가치를 합니다. 반면에 AI를 가끔씩만 사용하고 작업을 자동화하는 데 AI에 의존하지 않는 캐주얼 사용자라면, 무료 버전을 고수하는 것도 좋은 생각입니다. 무료 버전만으로도 여러분의 요구 사항과 기대치의 80%는 충족될 수 있습니다. 무료 버전은 가벼운 사용이나 실험에는 훌륭하지만, 깊이와 신뢰성이 부족할 수 있습니다. 이 점을 크게 신경 쓰지 않는다면 무료 버전을 계속 사용하는 것이 현명할 수 있습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n1. ChatGPT Plus는 더욱 정교한 추론 능력과 빠른 응답 속도로 전문적인 작업에 필수적입니다.\n2. Adobe Firefly는 상업적으로 안전한 고품질 이미지를 생성하며, Adobe Creative Cloud와의 최고의 통합성을 자랑합니다.\n3. Notion AI는 기존 Notion 워크스페이스에 AI 기능을 완벽하게 통합하여 생산성을 극대화하는 올인원 비서입니다.\n4. AI 유료 버전은 집약적인 사용과 고품질 결과가 필요한 전문가에게, 무료 버전은 가벼운 실험 및 캐주얼 사용자에게 적합합니다.\n* 이 정보는 2026년 1월 14일 기준으로 작성되었습니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 2026년 현재, 어떤 AI 도구가 가장 전문가에게 추천되나요?\nA1: 2026년 현재, 전문가들 사이에서 가장 각광받고 있는 AI 도구는 ChatGPT Plus, Adobe Firefly, Notion AI입니다. 이들은 각자의 분야에서 독보적인 기능과 효율성을 제공하여 작업의 질과 생산성을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다.\nQ2: ChatGPT Plus는 무료 버전과 비교하여 어떤 점이 크게 다른가요?\nA2: ChatGPT Plus는 최신 모델인 ChatGPT 5 접근, 피크 시간대 대기열 없음, 더 빠른 응답 속도, 복잡한 프롬프트 처리 능력 향상, 그리고 훨씬 더 정교하고 창의적인 답변을 제공합니다. 이는 비즈니스 아이디어 구상, 코드 디버깅, 콘텐츠 생성 등 전문적인 작업에 필수적인 요소입니다.\nQ3: Adobe Firefly를 사용해야 하는 주된 이유는 무엇인가요?\nA3: Adobe Firefly는 상업적으로 안전하게 사용할 수 있는 고품질 이미지를 생성하며, 텍스트 효과 적용 등 강력한 텍스트-이미지 변환 기능을 제공합니다. 특히 Adobe Creative Cloud 제품군과의 완벽한 통합으로 기존 디자인 워크플로우를 더욱 효율적으로 만듭니다.\nQ4: Notion AI가 다른 생산성 AI 도구와 차별화되는 점은 무엇인가요?\nA4: Notion AI는 기존 Notion 워크스페이스에 깊이 통합되어 있어, 별도의 도구를 오갈 필요 없이 바로 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 글쓰기, 아이디어 구상, 번역은 물론, 연결된 앱(Slack, Google Drive 등)의 정보를 바탕으로 스마트 검색과 요약 기능을 제공하여 통합적인 생산성 향상을 돕습니다.\nAI 기술은 계속해서 발전하고 있습니다. 오늘 소개된 AI 3대장이 여러분의 2026년을 더욱 빛나게 하기를 바랍니다. \n궁금한 점이나 의견이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나는 개인적으로 학생 창업가를 좋아하고, 이들이 창업하는 걸 적극적으로 추천하고 응원한다. 우리가 학생 창업가에게만 전문적으로 투자하거나 이들에게만 투자하는 펀드가 있는 건 아니지만, 스트롱은 지금까지 꾸준히 대학생 창업팀에 투자하고 있고 이들이 하는 몇 개의 이벤트를 후원하고 있다. 그리고 우린 모두 다 바빠서 외부 강연이나 발표는 거의 안, 못 하고 있는데, 학생들 대상의 강연이나 발표, 또는 해커톤 심사는 웬만하면 시간을 만들어서 참석하고 있다. 창업가들의 나이는 점점 더 낮아지고 있는데, 우리가 지향하는 첫 번째 기관투자자가 되기 위해서는 이제는 학생들에게 투자해야 하기 때문이다. 결국 이 학생들은 스트롱의 미래의 고객이기 때문에 우리가 학생들 대상으로 하는 모든 활동은 잠재 고객에 대한 영업/마케팅 활동이라고 봐도 무방하다. 이들이 지금 또는 나중에 창업할 때, 가장 먼저 생각나는 VC가 스트롱벤처스가 되는 게 우리의 목표다.\n내가 스트롱을 시작한 2012년만 해도 학생들은 창업을 거의 하지 않았다. 창업이 뭔지도 몰랐고, 어떻게 하는지도 몰랐고, 이들에게 투자해 주는 VC도 없었다. 창업은 취업하지 못하면 어쩔 수 없이 선택해야 하는 마지막 옵션이었기 때문에 내가 당시에 만났던 학생 창업가들은 준비도 안 됐고, 실력도 없었다. 실은, 아직도 대부분의 학부생이나 대학원생들은 취업을 선호하긴 하지만, 요샌 창업을 1순위로 생각하는 학생들이 점점 더 많아지고 있다는 게 내 개인적인 생각이다.\n요새도 우린 더 많은 학생 창업가를 만나기 위한 방법에 대해서 고민하고 있는데, 혹시 이 글을 읽는 학생분들 중 좋은 방법이 있다면 언제든지 제안해 주시면 좋겠다.\n이미 창업했거나, 창업을 생각하는 학생들에게 내가 몇 가지 해주고 싶은 조언이 있다. 꼭 이렇게 하라는 건 아니지만, 창업하기 전에 충분히 생각해 봐야 하는 주제들이고, 몇 개는 나중에 회사가 켜졌을 때 이 회사를 완전히 망가뜨릴 수 있는 중요한 내용이라고 생각한다.\n일단 가장 첫 번째 조언은, 사업은 학교 과제가 아니라는 것이다. 내가 만나는 많은 학생 창업가는 실은 학생 창업가가 아니라 그냥 창업 과제를 하는 학생이다. 이들은 사업할 준비가 전혀 되지 않았고, 그냥 학업 외 재미있는 일을 하고 싶고, 멀리서 다른 창업가를 보니까 본인들도 할 수 있을 것 같다는 생각으로 법인설립하고 대표이사 명함 만들고, 코파운더 명함 만들면서 여기저기 기웃거리는 수준의 활동을 하고 있다. 어떤 분은 소위 말하는 스타트업 대표이사 놀이에 빠져있고, 졸업하고 대기업에 취직하는 게 목적인데, 이력서에 “ABC 창업 경험” 한 줄 달기 위해서 창업을 하는 경우도 있었다. 이렇게 하다 보니, 당연히 사업을 풀타임으로 안 한다. 학업을 하면서 사업을 병행하는데, 이렇게 대충대충, 건성건성 해서 제대로 된 사업을 만들 수 있다면, 우리가 14년 동안 투자한 290개의 회사는 모두 다 유니콘이 돼야 했다.\n그래서 내가 학생 창업가에게 가장 먼저 드리고 싶은 조언은, 정말로 제대로 사업을 하려면 일단 그 마음가짐부터 제대로 가지고, 이를 실제로 행동에 옮기려면 학업을 휴학하거나, 아니면 자퇴하라는 것이다. 이렇게 하지 않고서는 절대로 제대로 사업을 할 수가 없다. 너무 이진법적인 생각 같지만, 창업은 all in or nothing이다.\n두 번째 조언은, 교수님의 말을 맹신하지 말라는 것이다. 그리고 되도록 창업하는 회사의 주주명부에서 교수님은 빼거나, 아니면 이들의 지분을 2% 이하로 낮추라는 조언을 드리고 싶다. 내가 만나는 대부분의 학생 창업 스타트업은, 그리고 특히 지도교수가 있는 대학원생이 창업한 스타트업의 창업팀에는 지도교수가 들어가 있다. 그리고 대부분의 경우 이들은 30% 이상의 지분을 보유하고 있다. 이게 왜 틀렸는지는 내가 전에 이 글에서 대략 설명했는데, 다시 한번 간략하게 요약하자면, 스타트업의 코파운더는 1년 365일 하루 24시간 이 사업 생각만 해야 하고, 이 사업에 그 무엇보다 높은 우선순위를 둬야 한다. 교수들은 이게 구조적으로 안 된다. 왜냐하면 학교가 이들의 직장이라서 항상 학교가 이들의 우선순위이기 때문이다. 나는 회사가 잘 되면 가장 고생하고 기여를 많이 한 사람들이 가장 많은 돈을 벌어야 한다고 생각하는데 지분이 이걸 결정한다. 회사가 안 되면 역시 지분이 가장 많은 분들이 모든 책임과 비난을 받아야 한다. 하지만, 이 회사에 all in 하지 않고, 시간이 날 때마다 와서 파트타임으로 조언과 훈수를 하는 교수들이 지분을 이렇게 많이 보유하는 건 확실히 불공평하다고 생각한다. 어떤 교수들은 학교에서 가르치고, 본인이 창업한 회사가 있고, 지도하는 학생들이 창업한 3~4개 회사의 높은 지분을 보유한 C 레벨 임원으로 활동하고 있는데, 이런 구조로 회사가 나중에 투자받고, 좋은 사람을 채용하고, 잘 되는 건 쉽지 않다.\n그래서 되도록 교수는 창업팀에서 빼라. 꼭 이들의 조언이나 도움이 필요하다면 스톡옵션을 0.5% 이하로 주고 고문으로 모시는 걸 권장한다. 전에 어떤 학생 대표에게 이런 이야기를 하니까 굉장히 곤란해하면서 나에게 다음과 같은 말을 했다. 본인도 졸업해야 하는데, 지도교수님이 승인하지 않으면 졸업을 못 하므로 이런 껄끄러운 대화를 하는 게 너무 힘들다고. 그래서 내가 위에서 말한 대로 진짜로 사업을 하려면 그냥 학업을 중단하는 게 이런 졸업의 고민으로부터 자유로워질 수 있는 가장 좋은 방법이다. 아니면, 교수님과 이 힘든 대화를 해서 쇼부를 봐야 한다. 사업하면 이보다 훨씬 더 어려운 대화를 많이 해야 하고 훨씬 더 힘든 결정을 많이 해야 하는데, 여기서부터 막힌다면 사업 못 한다.\n마지막 조언은, 스타트업은 돈을 버는 사업을 만드는 곳이지, 그 누구도 따라 할 수 없는 기술을 개발하는 조직이 아니라는 점이다. 본인이 현재 개발하고 연구하는 분야가 세계 최고 수준이라면 이건 정말 대단하고 축하할만하다. 하지만, 그렇다고 이게 세계 최고의 사업이 된다는 보장은 없다. 아니, 그렇게 되는 경우는 거의 없다. 그럼, 노벨상 받은 모든 이론과 기술이 유니콘 사업이 돼야 한다. 기술은 그냥 단지 기술일 뿐이다. 이 기술을 기반으로 비즈니스 모델을 만들고, 더 나아가서는 돈을 버는 사업으로 진화시키는 건 완전히 다른 일이다. 연구보다 사업이 더 어렵다는 말이 아니다. 그냥 완전히 다르다는 말이다.\n우리 같은 VC는 기술에 투자하지 않는다. 그 기술로 만드는 돈을 버는 사업에 투자한다. 이걸 명확하게 이해해야 한다. \n나는 젊고, 똑똑하고, 에너지 넘치는 학생 창업가를 정말 좋아한다. 이들이 맘먹고 사고 치면 유니콘이 아니라 데카콘 몇 마리 만들 수 있다고 믿는다. 나는 더 많은 학생이 창업해야 한다고 생각한다. 특히, 위에서 말한 내용에 대해서 충분히 고민해 본 학생 창업가들이라면 언제든지 스트롱에 연락해 주시길.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "바로 전 글에서 골프 이야기를 잠깐 했는데, 같은 내용으로 이 포스팅을 시작해 본다. 실제로 골프를 쳤던 방콕 골프장에서 1번 홀이 어려운 파 5였고, 여기서 나는 4개 오버해서 9개를 친 적이 있다.(골프 용어로는 쿼드러플인데, 절대로 해서는 안 되는 점수다). 그리고 그다음 2번 홀은 파3인데, 여기서 3개 오버하면서 6개를 쳐서 소위 말하는 양파를 했고, 3번 홀은 파4인데 6개를 쳐서 더블보기를 했다. 이렇게 치고 나니 18홀 중 3개를 쳤는데 점수는 이미 9+가 됐다. 그리고 이후 4번 홀부터 내 마인드는 어차피 이번 라운딩은 망했으니까 그냥 대충 막 쳐야겠다였고, 정말로 막 쳐서 최악의 점수가 나왔다. 그리고 막 치는 4시간 내내 이번 게임은 망했으니까, 다음에 제대로 쳐야지 생각했다.\n그런데 나중에 숙소로 돌아와서 생각해 보니, 정말 후회가 많이 됐고, 그날 내 행동에 대해 짜증이 많이 났다. 첫 3개 홀을 못 쳤으면, 그 다음엔 잘 치기 위해서 더 집중해야 했는데, 나는 그냥 이생망(=이번 생은 망했다)의 마인드로 고칠 수 있는 실수를 안 고치고 계속 실수했고, 이렇게 해서 조금만 경기가 안 풀리면 그냥 막 치는 게 습관화됐을 가능성이 매우 크다. 최악의 행동이었다.\n요새 내가 듣는 몇 팟캐스트의 단골이 ‘Atomic Habits’의 저자 제임스 클리어인데, 이 책에서 정확하게 이런 행동을 절대로 하지 말라고 하면서 “한 번 실수는 사고지만, 두 번 실수는 새로운 습관의 시작이 될 수 있다.”라는 말을 한다. 무슨 말이냐 하면, 내가 초반에 골프를 못 친건 사고지만, 이후에 포기하고 마음먹고 그냥 계속 실수한 건 나쁜 습관의 시작이 된다는 말이다.\n새해 결심을 아침에 운동을 열심히 하기로 했다면, 그리고 이게 작심삼일이 되는 나쁜 습관으로 바뀌는 걸 원치 않는다면, 매일 몸을 움직여야 한다. 아침 일찍 미팅이 있어서 하루 빠지고, 그다음 날은 늦게 일어나서 또 빠지면, 그냥 이번 주는 운동 안 하고 다음 주부터 열심히 해야지라는 생각을 많은 분들이 하는데, 이렇게 되면 일 년 내내 절대로 운동하지 않는다. 아침 일찍 미팅이 있어서 운동을 안 한 건 실수다. 그리고 늦게 일어나서 못 한 것도 실수다. 하지만, 그다음 날 곧바로 이 실수를 바로잡고 운동을 해야 한다. 안 그러면 운동하지 않는 행동이 습관화되기 때문이다.\n새해 결심이 다이어트라서 식단 관리를 잘하다가 화요일 저녁에 피자 한 판을 다 먹는 칼로리 폭탄 실수를 했다면, 그다음 날은 다시 제대로 식단 관리를 하면 된다. 하지만, 많은 사람들이 이렇게 먹으면 기분이 상하고 어차피 식단 망했기 때문에 이번 주는 그냥 막 먹고 다음 주부터 다시 식단 관리하자라는 생각으로 일주일 내내 막 먹는다. 이렇게 두 번, 세 번 실수하면 막 먹는 게 습관이 돼서 다이어트는 물 건너간다. 누구도 완벽할 순 없고, 누구나 다 실수할 수 있는데, 중요한 건 그 시점에 바로 고치는 것이다. 이생망 기분으로 두 번 실수하면, 정말로 이생망된다.\n운동을 빠지면, 다시 하면 된다. 잘하다가 또 빠지면, 그 이후에 또다시 하며 된다. 다이어트하는데 칼로리 폭탄을 먹었다면, 그다음 끼니는 건강하게 먹으면 된다. 건강하게 먹다가 어느 날 혼자서 치킨 한 마리랑 맥주를 먹었다면, 그다음 끼니부터 또 식단 관리하면 된다.\n제임스 클리어의 두 번 실수하지 않는 프레임은 다음과 같다. 하루를 4쿼터로 나누고, 이 중 4쿼터를 모두 완벽하게 살면 좋겠지만, 그렇게 하기는 너무 힘드니까 4쿼터 중 한 쿼터만 실수하는 걸 목표로 삼으라고 한다. 한 쿼터만 실수하고, 나머지 세 쿼터는 실수하지 않는 걸 목표로 하면 나름 좋은 습관을 만드는 인생을 살 수 있다고 한다.\n한 번 실수했을 때 너무 자책하거나 실망하지 말고, 곧바로 다시 시도하는 게 연속적으로 실패하는 습관의 형성을 방지할 수 있다. “이생망”이라는 말은 우리가 절대로 생각해서도 안 되고, 입에 담아서도 안 되는 말이다. 다음 생은 없으니까.",

《사하촌》 중, 1936\n김정한의 소설 《사하촌》을 보면 일제강점기 소작제도의 현실이 얼마나 고단했는지가 잘 묘사된다. 풍년이면 쌀값이 싸져서 돈을 못벌고, 흉년이면 내다 팔 쌀이 없어서 돈을 못벌었다. 조선 후기 민중들의 삶은 팍팍하기 그지없었다. 그래도 삶은 계속되어야 하고 자식들은 먹여살려야 하지 않겠는가. 오늘날 우리가 대출 이자에 시달리듯 그때의 민중들은 동네 양반지주들에게 땅과 쌀을 빌렸다. 그런데 이게 문제였다. 당시 ‘장리’라고 불렸던 이자가 너무 컸기 때문이다. \n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}‘1년에 5할’, 보릿고개 시절 쌀을 빌리면 50%를 더하여 갚는 방식인데 ‘십오지사채’라고도 불렸다. 자기 땅을 가지고 있으면 20%의 세금을 내지만 땅을 빌리면 이자를 두 배 이상을 내야 했다. 비율제였기 때문에 쌀 100석을 생산하면 50석, 150석을 생산하면 75석을 내야하는 식이었다. 식량이 부족한 봄철, 이른바 춘궁기에 쌀을 빌리면 또다시 50%의 이자가 붙었다. 그 결과 추수 때가 되면 생산량의 60~80%를 이자로 내야 하는 경우도 적지 않았다. 임술농민봉기(1862), 동학농민운동(1894) 등 구한말 농민들의 저항이 계속된 이유도 결국은 무자비한 이자 때문이었다.\n소작 문제는 일제강점기 들어 더욱 악화되었다. 제국주의 본국에서 식민지 백성들의 고통에 무슨 관심이 있겠는가. 순사들은 모른 척으로 일관했고 총독부는 지주 편이었기 때문에 농민은 소작권마저 보장받지 못했다. 소설 《사하촌》에서는 갑자기 소작권을 빼앗겨서 어려움을 겪게 되는 농민 이야기부터 위에 나온 것처럼 빚을 감당하지 못하다 자신의 땅마저 빼앗기는 온갖 비극적인 이야기가 담겨있다.\n이자는 시대마다 다른 이름으로 불려 왔지만, 그 역사는 오래됐다. ‘돈놀이’나 ‘사채’ 같은 표현이 말해주듯, 돈을 빌려주고 이자를 받는 행위에 대한 경계와 불신은 고대부터 존재해왔다. 돈이나 땅을 빌려주어 이익을 얻는 사람들이 생겨났고, 이자를 감당하며 생계를 이어가는 방식 역시 시대와 지역을 가리지 않고 반복됐다.\n하지만 근대 산업혁명을 거치며 이자의 의미는 달라지기 시작한다. 금융 제도가 정비되고 경제를 운영하는 방식에 대한 이해가 깊어지면서, 이자는 개인 간 거래를 넘어 보다 조직적이고 전문적인 경제 활동의 일부로 자리 잡게 된다. 이 변화의 흐름 속에서, 이자를 다루는 방식으로 시대를 앞서간 ‘지아니니’라는 사람이 있었다.\n기회: 뱅크 오브 아메리카와 백설공주\n아마데오 지아니니(1870~1949)는 이탈리아 이민자 가정에서 태어났다. 미국 남북전쟁 이후 산업화와 국가 재건이 본격화되면서, 많은 이탈리아 이민자들이 미국에 자리를 잡았고 지아니니의 가족도 그중 하나였다. 당시 많은 이민자들이 그렇듯 지아니니 역시 13살의 어린 나이에 일을 시작했고 우연한 기회에 임대사업을 접한 후 장인의 부동산 사업을 도우며 돈의 흐름을 익혀갔다.\n31살이 되던 해 장인이 세상을 떠나자 지아니니는 샌프란시스코에 ‘뱅크 오브 이탈리아(Bank of Italy)’라는 작은 회사를 차렸다. 금융에 대한 이해가 부족하고 신용도가 낮아 기존 은행에서는 담보를 통한 대출이 불가능한 이들을 상대로 한 회사였다. 일종의 틈새시장을 노린 셈이지만, 대출 규모가 낮고 연체 위험 또한 높기 때문에 큰 수익을 보기 어려운 구조이기도 했다.\n2년간 어렵게 회사를 꾸려오던 1906년 4월 18일, 샌프란시스코를 강타한 대지진이 모든 것을 뒤흔들었다. 지아니니는 곧장 은행으로 달려가 200만 달러 규모의 금과 현금, 유가증권 등을 간신히 챙겨 나온다. 이날 지진은 규모 8.3으로, 약 3,000명의 사망자와 도시 인구의 절반을 넘는 23만 명의 이재민을 남긴 미국 역사상 최악의 지진 재해였다. 지진의 여파로 화재가 잇따르면서 지역의 군소 은행들은 무너졌고, 일부 은행은 금고가 녹아내릴 정도였다. 수많은 사람들의 재산이 하루아침에 공중으로 사라졌다.\n하지만 빠른 대응으로 자신과 고객의 자산을 지켜낸 지아니니에게 재난은 기회가 되었다. 그는 샌프란시스코 북쪽 해변 근처 부두에 자리를 잡고 나무 판자와 배럴을 책상 삼아, 삶의 터전을 잃은 사람들을 직접 만났다. 대지진과 화재로 모든 것을 잃은 이탈리아 이민자들에게 기존 은행들은 뻣뻣하게 굴었다. 담보가 없다는 이유로 대출을 거절했기 때문이다.\n하지만 지아니니의 선택은 달랐다. 그는 이민자들의 이야기를 직접 듣고, 사업 계획이 분명하다면 구매 물품을 담보 삼아 대출을 실행했다. 소문은 빠르게 퍼졌고, 작은 술집을 개조해 쓰던 은행은 곧 샌프란시스코 리틀 이탤리의 상징인 콜럼버스타워로 자리를 옮기게 된다. 소상공인의 사정을 이해하고 그에 맞는 금융을 설계한 지아니니의 방식이 힘을 발휘한 순간이었다.\n당시만 하더라도 금융은 미국 동부, 특히 뉴욕의 금융기관들이 꽉 잡고 있었고, 이들은 미국 서부를 변방으로 여겼다. 급변하던 샌프란시스코와 캘리포니아의 경제를 제대로 이해하지 못한 것도 사실이었다. 당시 미국 서부는 뜨거웠다. 일명 골드러시. 수많은 사람들이 몰려 들었고 항구와 철도같은 대단위 사업은 물론이고 이민자를 중심으로 과일, 와인, 통조림 등 농업과 식품산업이 커나가고 있었다. 지진에도 불구하고 재건 붐이 일며 서부는 빠르게 변화하고 있었다.\n20세기 초 호황기와 전쟁기를 거치며 그는 적극적인 대출을 이어갔고, 주법 은행과 국법 은행으로 나뉘어 있던 미국의 금융 시스템을 유연하게 활용해 사업을 빠르게 확장했다. 기존의 사업을 키우고 새로운 은행을 인수합병하는 가운데 그의 은행은 1928년 ‘뱅크 오브 아메리카(Bank of America)’로 이름이 바뀌었으며 이후 미국을 대표하는 금융기관으로 자리 잡는다.\n가난한 이탈리아 이민자를 상대하던 꼬마은행 사업가에서 미국을 대표하는 은행으로 성장하기까지. 지아니니는 합병과 인수를 거듭하며 기업이나 정치권과 교묘히 결탁하는 등 미국 금융계를 시끌벅적하게 만든 인물이기도 하다. 하지만 그의 뚝심과 소외된 영역에 과감히 투자하는 방식은 통했다.\n그는 월트 디즈니 스튜디오의 대출을 주관하기도 했다. 당시만 해도 ‘동화로 만든 만화영화를 누가 보겠느냐’는 인식이 투자자들 사이에서 지배적이었다. 하지만 지아니니는 제작 중이던 영화의 일부를 직접 확인한 뒤, 영화 필름 자체를 담보로 자금을 내주었다. 당시 디즈니는 제작비가 200만 달러 이상 초과되어 난항을 겪고 있었는데, 지아니니의 투자로 탄생한 작품이 바로 《백설공주와 일곱난쟁이》다. \n이후 찰리 채플린을 비롯해 20세기 폭스, 컬럼비아 영화사 등 여러 창작자와 기업이 지아니니의 금융 지원을 받으며 성장했다. 20세기 미국 대중문화사에서 그의 안목있는 투자 방식은 문화 산업의 위상을 바꾸어놓았다고 해도 과언이 아니다.\n질서: 세계의 시선을 한 몸에 받는 FED의 정책\n조선 후기와 일제강점기 조선 농민을 괴롭혔던 소작료, 그리고 산업혁명기 이탈리아 이민자들과 새로운 사업에 도움을 주었던 지아니니의 대출 사업. 두 사례에서 알 수 있듯 '이자'는 매우 이중적인 성격을 지니고 있다. 과도한 이자는 삶을 위협하지만, 이자 수익을 전제로 한 과감한 투자가 없으면 산업은 앞으로 나아가기 어렵다. 생계와 성장, 개인의 삶과 국가 경제. 이자는 이 두 세계가 만나는 지점에서 가장 현실적인 문제이기도 하다.\n아마 이 지점에서 자신의 역할을 가장 분명하게 수행한 인물이 매리너 애클스(Marriner Stoddard Eccles, 1890~1977)일 것이다. 사업가 출신이었던 그는 민주당 정부에서 연방준비제도(이하 연준)*의 위상을 이전과는 다른 차원으로 끌어올린 인물로 평가받는다.\n*미국의 통화금융정책을 수행하는 중앙은행제도, 보통 약자인 FED(Federal Reserve System)로 불린다.\n애클스가 프랭클린 루스벨트 대통령 시절 정부에 합류했을 당시만 해도, 연준은 여전히 19세기의 원칙을 그대로 따르고 있었다. 이른바 ‘진성어음주의’라 불리던 원칙에 따라, 경제활동에 적정한 상업어음을 할인해주는 것이 중앙은행의 역할이라고 여겼기 때문이다. 경제에 직접 개입하기보다는, 실물경제를 조용히 뒷받침하는 역할에 가까웠다.\n하지만 애클스가 살았던 시대는 그야말로 격변의 시기였다. 1929년 대공황으로 대량 실업이 발생했고, 설상가상으로 제2차 세계대전에, 6.25전쟁까지 벌어졌다. 국가도 개인도, 급변하는 정세에 위협받던 시기였다. 애클스가 보기에 적정한 통화정책과 규제정책의 실천은 단순히 나라 경제를 일으키는 것을 넘어 국민들의 삶을 돌보는 중요한 수단이었다. 경기가 침체될 때는 숨통을 틔워주고, 반대로 과열될 때는 속도를 늦춰야 한다는 것이 그의 생각이었다. 시장의 성장을 무작정 뒷받침하기보다, 물가 안정과 지속적인 성장을 함께 관리하는 기준이 필요하다고 보았다.\n애클스는 루스벨트 대통령을 설득했고, 연방준비제도법 개정 등 굵직한 제도 개혁을 이끌어냈다. 무엇보다 그는 연준의 독립과 자율성을 위한 제도적인 방안을 마련하는 데 동분서주했다. 재무부 장관과 차관의 연준 참여를 제한하고, 연준 이사의 교체 주기도 정권 교체에 영향을 받지 않는 방식으로 조정했으며, 대통령의 임기 동안 연준 위원 임명에 제한을 두었다. 즉, 로비스트들에 크게 영향을 받는 정권의 이해 관계를 벗어나 거시적인 경제정책을 추진하기 위한 제도적 기반을 만들었다. 소위 ‘금리 정책’을 통해 국민 경제의 안정을 기하는 방식, 대출 이자의 적정성을 도모하면서 기업과 가계에 도움이 되는 전통이 애클스에 의해 본격화된 것이다.\n침식: 나라를 담보로 한 대출\n조선 말 국가의 재정 상태는 엉망이었다. ‘나라에는 한 달 쓸 비축도 없다’라는 말이 나올 지경이었다. 서양 열강과 청나라, 일본의 간섭을 막으려면 국가 주도의 적극적인 근대화 정책이 필요했다. 하지만 철도를 놓고 전신을 연결하는 대단위 산업을 위해서는 막대한 양의 자금이 필요했고, 조선은 결정적으로 자금이 부족했다.\n이 와중에 1882년 임오군란을 진압하기 위해 청나라 군대가 조선에 파견됐고, 이때 중국의 정치인 이홍장은 자신의 심복인 원세개(위안스카이)를 함께 보낸다. 원세개의 목표는 명확했다. 막대한 자금을 대출해주고 조선을 청나라에 예속시킬 것. 정치력을 극대화하여 일본의 간섭을 뿌리치고 조선을 식민지로 만들 것. 이러한 원칙하에 원세개는 적극적인 차관 정책을 추진하였다.\n1882년 8월 조선은 청나라로부터 50만 냥의 돈을 연이자 8리(0.8%), 거치 7년 상환 조건으로 빌렸다. 개화 정책을 추진하기 위해 빌려온 대규모 차관이었다. 1885년 6월에는 ‘의주전선 조약’을 체결했는데 전신 시설을 위해 5년 거치 20년 기한으로 10만 냥의 차관을 또 빌렸다. 이 조약은 파격적이었다. 이자를 받지 않았기 때문이다. 대신 매년 5,000냥씩 무이자 상환을 하되 상환이 어려울 경우 전선부설권 및 관리권을 청나라가 갖는 것을 조건으로 했다. 1889년이 되면 조선이 청나라에게 빌린 돈이 130만 냥에 달했다.\n당시 조선은 갑신정변 때 피해를 이유로 배상금을 요구했던 일본의 5만 냥을 갚지 못해 세창양행* 같은 해외 기업으로부터 돈을 빌리고 있었다. 하지만 원세개는 끊임없는 내정간섭을 통해 청나라 이외의 나라에서부터 차관을 들여오는 것을 막았고, 그만큼 조선의 시장과 산업을 지배하였다. 물론 이 시도는 1894년 청일전쟁에서 청나라가 일본에 의해 완전히 패배하면서 끝나게 된다. 하지만 이후 일본은 같은 방식으로 조선을 집어삼키는 데 성공한다.\n*1884년 독일 마이어 상사(Meyer 商社)의 제물포 지점으로 설립된 무역상사. 근대화 정책을 명분으로 독일산 기계와 기술자 도입을 담당하며 각종 이권을 확보한 창구 역할을 했다.\n이 사례는 19-20세기 제국주의 국가들이 약소국을 지배해온 전형적인 방식이기도 하다. 자금에 의존하게 한 후, 빚은 점차 통제와 간섭으로 이어졌다. 돈을 빌려 감당할 수 없는 이자의 늪에 빠지는 것은 개인의 생계를 넘어, 때로는 국가의 존망까지 좌우하는 문제로 확장된다.\n사실 대출이자 몇 퍼센트가 올랐냐, 떨어졌냐를 두고 희비가 엇갈리는 것이 평범한 우리의 일상이다. 하지만 금리라는 숫자 뒤에는 언제나 더 큰 이야기가 놓여있다. 앞서 살펴본 네 가지 역사적 사례처럼 정부의 정책, 경기의 흐름, 그리고 국제사회의 변화 같은 구조적인 배경이 있다는 사실을 기억해야 한다. 지아니니와 애클스가 좋은 선례를 만들었던 것처럼, 이자와 금리는 책임 있게 다뤄질 때 기회와 질서가 된다.\n당연한 이야기지만, 좋은 정책을 통해 안정적으로 금리가 관리될 때 사람들은 삶을 잘 꾸리고 미래를 계획해 나갈 수 있다. 그리고 좋은 정책의 출발점에는 ‘세상이 어떻게 흘러가고 변화하는가’를 냉정하게 바라보는 국민들의 시선이 있다. 정부는 언제나 국민의 눈치를 보기 때문이다. 따라서 우리의 시선은 보다 이성적이면서도 공공적인 방향을 가리킬 필요가 있다.",

변화들이에요. 여러 정책 중에서 꼭 챙겨볼 만한 26가지를 선정해 정리했어요.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}누구에게나 해당되는\n일상 속 변화\n1. 최저임금 10,320원\n.css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}2026년 최저임금은 시간당 10,320원으로 2025년(10,030원)보다 2.9% 올랐어요. 주 40시간 근무 기준으로 계산하면, 주휴수당을 포함해 월 215만 6,880원을 받을 수 있어요.\n2. 실업급여 상승\n실업급여 하루 최대 지급액이 6만 6,000원에서 6만 8,100원으로 올랐어요. 한 달로 계산하면 약 6만 3,000원을 더 받게 돼요.\n3. 많이 탈수록 돌려받는 대중교통비\n대중교통을 자주 이용하는 사람을 위한 새로운 환급 제도가 시작돼요. 새로 도입되는 ‘모두의 카드’는 이용 횟수에 제한이 있었던 K-패스와 달리 일정 금액 이상 사용한 대중교통비를 돌려주는 방식이에요. 기존에 K-패스를 사용하고 있었다면 별도로 신청하지 않아도 대중교통 이용 금액에 따라 가장 많은 환급 혜택이 자동으로 적용돼요.\n4. 따로 계산하는 배당소득세\n고배당 상장법인*에서 받은 배당소득을 종합소득 과세 대상에서 제외해 분리과세하는 배당소득 분리과세도 시작돼요. 그동안은 연 2,000만 원을 초과하는 금융소득이 다른 종합소득과 합산되어 누진세율이 적용되었지만, 이제는 배당 규모에 따라 차등 세율이 적용돼 세금 부담이 줄어들 수 있어요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 국내에 상장된 기업 중 현금배당액이 전년 대비 감소하지 않았으면서 배당성향 40% 이상이거나 배당성향이 25% 이상 및 전년 대비 10% 이상 배당이 증가한 상장법인. 투자회사, 공모·사모펀드, SPC, 부동산 리츠, 배당 ETF 상품 등은 해당하지 않아요.\n5. 자동으로 신청되는 금리인하요구권\n그동안은 대출 이후 소득이 늘거나 신용점수가 올라도, 금리인하요구권에 대해 잘 몰라서 지나치는 경우가 많았어요. 상반기부터는 토스처럼 마이데이터 서비스*를 활용하는 핀테크 앱에서 신용 상태와 소득 변화를 자동으로 확인해 금리인하요구권을 신청해줘요.\n* 여러 금융기관에 흩어진 금융소비자의 정보를 한곳에 모아 관리하는 서비스\n6. 전기·전자제품 회수·재활용 의무 모든 제품으로 확대\n가정에서 사용하는 모든 전기·전자제품이 생산자 책임 재활용(EPR)* 제도 대상으로 확대돼요. 작년까지는 세탁기, 냉장고, TV, 컴퓨터 등 중·대형 기기 50종만 해당됐는데, 이제 건조기, 전기자전거, 보조배터리, 블루투스 이어폰, 휴대용 선풍기까지 모든 전기·전자제품을 폐기물 스티커 없이 무상으로 수거해요.\n* Extended Producer Responsibility: 제품 생산자에게 제품 및 포장재의 폐기물 수거 및 재활용 의무를 부여하는 제도\n7. 농어촌 여행하면 50% 돌려받는 여행비\n인구감소지역으로 여행을 가면 여행 경비의 50%를 지역화폐로 돌려받을 수 있어요. 개인은 최대 10만 원, 단체는 최대 20만 원까지 지원받을 수 있어요. 여행지역에 사전 신청해 혜택 대상자로 선정되면, 여행을 마친 뒤 환급받는 방식이에요. 인구감소지역 84곳 중 공모로 선정된 20곳을 대상으로 상반기에 시행될 예정이에요.\n8. 고향사랑기부금 세액공제 확대\n10만 원 초과 20만 원 이하 고향사랑기부금에 대한 세액공제율이 15%에서 40%로 올라요. 주소지 외 지역에 20만 원을 기부하면 10만 원은 전액 공제되고, 나머지 10만 원은 지방소득세 포함 44%가 공제돼 총 14만 4,000원의 세액공제를 받을 수 있어요. 여기에 기부금액의 30% 한도로 답례품도 받을 수 있어서, 20만 원으로 20만 4,000원의 혜택을 볼 수 있죠.\n일을 한다면\n알아야 하는 정책\n9. 국민연금 보험료율·소득대체율 인상\n국민연금 보험료율이 9%에서 9.5%로 인상됐어요. 직장인은 늘어난 보험료를 회사와 절반씩 나눠 부담하고, 지역가입자나 자영업자는 전액을 본인이 부담해요. 월 300만 원 소득 기준으로 직장인은 약 7,500원, 지역가입자는 약 15,000원을 더 내야 해요.\n부담만 늘어나는 것은 아니에요. 보험료율과 함께 소득대체율*도 41.5%에서 43%로 올랐어요. 이 비율이 높아지면 연금 가입자가 노후에 받는 연금액도 커져요. 매달 내는 돈이 조금씩 늘지만, 그만큼 노후의 소득 안전망도 커지는 거죠.\n* 가입자의 생애 평균 소득에서 연금액이 차지하는 비율\n10. 3년 만에 인상된 건강보험료율\n건강보험료율도 7.09%에서 7.19%로 올랐어요. 월 300만 원 소득 기준으로 직장가입자는 약 1,500원이 올라 10만 7,850원, 지역가입자는 약 3,000원이 올라 21만 5,700원을 건강보험료로 내게 돼요.\n11. 중소기업 직장인을 위한 든든한 한 끼\n인구감소지역에서 근무하는 중소기업 직장인들은 아침이나 점심 중 한 끼를 지원받아요. 아침밥 지원은 1월부터 시행되며, 백반이나 김밥처럼 쌀로 만든 식사를 1,000원에 먹을 수 있어요. 하반기부터 시행되는 점심밥 지원은 근로지 내 식당에서 결제한 점심 식사값의 20%를 월 4만 원 한도로 할인 받는 정책이에요.\n12. 일손부족일자리 동행인센티브 신설\n직업훈련이나 일 경험 프로그램을 수료한 50세 이상 중장년층이 제조업, 운수업, 창고업 등 인력이 부족한 업종에 취업하면 인센티브를 받을 수 있어요. 근로자가 6개월, 12개월 근속할 경우 정부에게 각각 180만 원씩, 총 360만 원을 지급 받아요.\n아이 키우는 부모라면\n꼭 챙겨야 할 정보\n13. 육아기 10시 출근제 시작\n육아기 자녀를 둔 근로자가 돌봄 시간을 확보할 수 있도록 ‘육아기 10시 출근제’ 지원 사업이 새로 생겼어요. 만 12세 이하 자녀를 둔 근로자에게 임금 감소 없이 근로시간 단축을 허용한 중소·중견 사업주에게 정부가 근로자 1인당 월 30만 원을 지원하는 제도예요. 회사가 이 제도를 운영하는지 확인해보세요. 단, 육아기 근로시간 단축 제도와는 중복 지원되지 않아요.\n14. 늘어난 육아기 근로시간 단축 급여\n자녀 양육을 위해 근로시간을 줄인 근로자에게 지급되는 육아기 근로시간 단축 급여 상한액이 올랐어요. 주당 근무 시간을 10시간까지 줄이면 월 최대 250만 원, 10시간 이상 줄이면 최대 160만 원까지 지원돼요.\n15. 출산전후휴가 급여 상한액 증가\n출산전후휴가 급여 상한액이 월 210만 원에서 220만 원으로 올랐어요. 출산전후휴가는 총 90일이에요. 이 가운데 앞 60일은 회사가 급여를 지급하고, 남은 30일은 고용보험에서 지급해요. 근로자가 속한 회사가 우선지원대상기업*이라면 앞 60일 급여의 일부를 정부가 회사에 지원해줘요. 이때 정부가 회사에 지원하는 최대 금액이 월 220만 원으로 올랐어요. 남은 30일은 고용보험에서 지급되며, 이 기간에도 월 최대 220만 원까지 받을 수 있어요.\n* 상시 근로자 수가 제조업의 경우 500인 이하, 건설업ㆍ광업ㆍ운수업ㆍ창고업ㆍ통신업의 경우 300인 이하, 기타 산업의 경우 100인 이하인 중소기업\n16. 자녀 기준으로 넓어진 보육수당 비과세 한도\n만 6세 이하 자녀의 보육과 관련해서 지급받는 비과세 한도가 근로자 1인당 월 20만 원에서 자녀 1인당 월 20만 원으로 확대돼요. 자녀가 2명이면 40만 원, 3명이면 60만 원까지 비과세 혜택을 받을 수 있어요.\n17. 자녀수에 따라 커지는 신용카드 소득공제 혜택\n자녀 수에 따른 신용카드 소득공제 기본한도가 확대됐어요. 작년에는 연간 총급여 7,000만 원 이하인 경우 자녀 수와 무관하게 300만 원이었는데, 올해부터는 자녀 1명이면 350만 원, 자녀 2명 이상이면 400만 원으로 늘어나요. 총급여 7,000만 원 초과자는 무자녀일 때 250만 원, 자녀 1명일 때 275만 원, 자녀 2명 이상일 때 300만 원까지 공제받을 수 있어요.\n18. 초등 저학년 예체능 학원비 세제지원\n교육비 세액공제 대상에 만 9세 미만 자녀의 예체능 학원비도 포함됐어요. 이제 피아노, 태권도, 미술 등의 학원비도 연말정산 때 15% 세액공제받을 수 있어요.\n19. 육아휴직자 주담대 원금상환유예\n육아휴직 기간에는 주택담보대출 원금을 갚지 않고 이자만 내면 돼요. 본인이나 배우자가 육아휴직 중이라면 1월 31일부터 신청할 수 있어요. 집값이 9억 원 이하인 1주택자가 대출받은 지 1년 이상 된 경우 신청 가능해요. 육아휴직이 길어지면 최대 3년까지 연장할 수 있어요.\n20. 장난감도 이제 분리배출 대상\n생산자 책임 재활용(EPR) 제도 대상에 완구류도 추가됐어요. 그동안 레고를 비롯한 플라스틱 완구류는 재활용 의무대상에서 빠져 종량제봉투에 담아 버려야 했지만, 이제는 일반 플라스틱과 동일하게 분리배출할 수 있어요. 버려진 완구류는 회수 후 플레이크 형태로 만들어져 건설자재로 다시 쓰여요. 단, 배터리가 들어간 전기·전자제품 완구는 폭발 위험이 있어 소형가전 전용 수거함이나 지자체 전자제품 회수체계로 배출해야 해요.\n청년들을 위한\n새로운 기회\n21. 청년미래적금 신설\n6월에 청년미래적금이 출시돼요. 기존 청년도약계좌를 대신하는 상품으로, 가입 기간을 5년에서 3년으로 줄여 부담을 낮췄어요. 매달 저축하면 은행 이자와 별도로 정부가 저축액의 일정 비율을 지원금으로 적립해주고, 이자 소득은 전액 비과세예요. 이를 연 이자율로 환산하면 일반형은 최대 12%, 우대형은 16.9% 수준이죠. 우대형 가입자가 월 50만 원씩 3년 동안 저축하면, 정부 기여금을 더해 최대 2,200만 원의 목돈을 모을 수 있어요. 만 19~34세 청년 중 개인소득 6,000만 원 이하, 기준 중위소득 200% 이하라면 가입할 수 있어요.\n22. 청년일자리도약장려금 비수도권 우대지원\n비수도권 중소기업에서 2년간 근무하면 장려금을 받을 수 있어요. 근무 지역에 따라 일반 지역은 480만 원, 우대지원지역은 600만 원, 특별지원지역은 최대 720만 원까지 지원돼요.\n23. 대학생·대학원생 학자금대출\n취업 후 상환 학자금대출은 학부생과 대학원생이 재학 중 상환 부담 없이 학업에 전념하고 취업 후 상환하는 제도예요. 원래는 가구소득에 따라 신청할 수 있었지만, 올해부터 등록금 대출에 한해 소득이나 재산과 관계없이 누구나 신청할 수 있게 되었어요.\n24. 계속 이어지는 청년월세지원\n2025년까지만 운영 예정이었던 청년월세지원사업이 이제 상시 사업으로 바뀌어요. 만 19~34세 청년 중 기준 중위소득 60% 이하이면서 원가구* 소득이 기준 중위소득 100% 이하라면 24개월간 월 최대 20만 원의 월세를 지원받을 수 있어요.\n* 청년 가구와 부모를 포함한 가구\n25. 혜택이 넓어진 청년문화예술패스\n청년들에게 공연·전시 관람비 15만원을 지원하던 문화예술패스의 혜택이 더 커졌어요. 지원 대상은 만 19세에서 만 19~20세로 확대됐고, 비수도권에 거주하는 청년은 지원금이 20만 원으로 늘어났어요.\n26. 예비군 훈련비 상승\n2박 3일 동원훈련에 참가하는 1~4년 차 예비군 훈련비가 8만 2,000원에서 9만 5,000원으로, 4일간 출퇴근 방식 동원훈련 참가자 훈련비는 4만 원에서 5만 원으로 올라요. 5, 6년 차 예비군이 기본훈련과 작계훈련에 참가할 경우에는 별도 훈련비 2만 원을 지급해요.\n* 이 콘텐츠는 기획재정부에서 발간한
