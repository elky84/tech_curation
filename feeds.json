        "content:encodedSnippet": "The 2025 Typed Python Survey, conducted by contributors from JetBrains, Meta, and the broader Python typing community, offers a comprehensive look at the current state of Python’s type system and developer tooling. With 1,241 responses (a 15% increase from last year), the survey captures the evolving sentiment, challenges, and opportunities around Python typing in the open-source ecosystem. In this blog we’ll cover a summary of the key findings and trends from this year’s results.\nWho Responded?\nThe survey was initially distributed on official social media accounts by the survey creators, and subsequently shared organically across further platforms including Reddit, email newsletters, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitter. When respondents were asked which platform they heard about the survey from, Reddit emerged as the most effective channel, but significant engagement also came from email newsletters and Mastodon, reflecting the diverse spaces where Python developers connect and share knowledge.\nThe respondent pool was predominantly composed of developers experienced with Python and typing. Nearly half reported over a decade of Python experience, and another third had between five and 10 years. While there was representation from newcomers, the majority of participants brought substantial expertise to their responses. Experience with type hints was similarly robust, with most respondents having used them for several years and only a small minority indicating no experience with typing.\nTyping Adoption and Attitudes\nThe survey results reveal that Python’s type hinting system has become a core part of development for most engineers. An impressive 86% of respondents report that they “always” or “often” use type hints in their Python code, a figure that remains consistent with last year’s Typed Python survey. \nFor the first time this year the survey also asked participants to indicate how many years of experience they have with Python and with Python typing. We found that adoption of typing is similar across all experience levels, but there are some interesting nuances:\nDevelopers with 5–10 years of Python experience are the most enthusiastic adopters, with 93% reporting regularly using type hints.\nAmong the most junior developers (0–2 years of experience), adoption is slightly lower at 83%. Possible reasons for this could be the learning curve for newcomers (repeatedly mentioned in later survey questions).\nFor senior developers (10+ years of experience), adoption was the lowest of all cohorts, with  only 80% reporting using them always or often. Reasons for this drop are unclear, it could reflect more experienced python developers having gotten used to writing Python without type hints before they were supported, or possibly they are more likely to work on larger or legacy codebases that are difficult to migrate.\nPercent of respondents who use types “often” or “always,” segmented by years of Python experience.\nOverall, the data shows that type hints are widely embraced by the Python community, with strong support from engineers at all experience levels. However, we should note there may be some selection bias at play here, as it’s possible developers who are more familiar with types and use them more often are also more likely to be interested in taking a survey about it.\nWhy Developers Love Python Typing\nWhen asked what developers loved about the Python type system there were some mixed reactions, with a number of responses just stating, “nothing” (note this was an optional question). This indicates the presence of some strong negative opinions towards the type system among a minority of Python users. The majority of responses were positive, with the following themes emerging prominently:\nOptionality and Gradual Adoption: The optional nature of the type system and the ability to adopt it incrementally into existing projects are highly valued, allowing flexibility in development.\nImproved Readability and Documentation: Type hints serve as in-code documentation, making code clearer and easier to read, understand, and reason about for both the author and other developers, especially in larger codebases.\nEnhanced Tooling and IDE Support: The type system significantly improves IDE features like autocomplete/IntelliSense, jump-to-definition, and inline type hints, leading to a better developer experience.\nBug Prevention and Code Correctness: It helps catch errors and subtle bugs earlier during development or refactoring, increasing confidence and leading to more robust and reliable code.\nFlexibility and Features: Respondents appreciate the flexibility, expressiveness, and powerful features of the system, including protocols, generics (especially the new syntax), and the ability to inspect annotations at runtime for use with libraries like Pydantic/FastAPI.\nSample of responses to the question, “What do you love about Python Typing?”\nChallenges and Pain Points\nIn addition to assessing positive sentiment towards Python typing, we also asked respondents what challenges and pain points they face. With over 800 responses to the question, “What is the hardest part about using the Python type system?” the following themes were identified:\nThird-Party Library/Framework Support: Many respondents cited the difficulty of integrating types with untyped, incomplete, or incorrect type annotations in third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django).\nComplexity of Advanced Features: Advanced concepts such as generics, TypeVar (including co/contravariance), callables/decorators, and complex/nested types were frequently mentioned as difficult to understand or express.\nTooling and Ecosystem Fragmentation: The ecosystem is seen as chaotic, with inconsistencies between different type checkers (like Mypy and Pyright), slow performance of tools like Mypy, and a desire for an official, built-in type checker.\nLack of Enforcement and Runtime Guarantees: The fact that typing is optional and is not enforced at runtime or by the Python interpreter makes it harder to convince others to use it, enforce its consistent use, and fully trust the type hints.\nVerbosity and Code Readability: The necessary type hints, especially for complex structures, can be verbose, make the code less readable, and feel non-Pythonic.\nDealing with Legacy/Dynamic Code: It is hard to integrate typing into old, untyped codebases, particularly when they use dynamic Python features that do not play well with static typing.\nType System Limitations and Evolution: The type system is perceived as incomplete or less expressive than languages like TypeScript, and its rapid evolution means syntax and best practices are constantly changing.\nMost Requested Features\nA little less than half of respondents had suggestions for what they thought was missing from the Python type system, the most commonly requested features being:\nMissing Features From TypeScript and Other Languages: Many respondents requested features inspired by TypeScript, such as Intersection types (like the & operator), Mapped and Conditional types, Utility types (like Pick, Omit, keyof, and typeof), and better Structural typing for dictionaries/dicts (e.g., more flexible TypedDict or anonymous types).\nRuntime Type Enforcement and Performance: A significant number of developers desire optional runtime type enforcement or guarantees, as well as performance optimizations (JIT/AOT compilation) based on the type hints provided.\nBetter Generics and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs): Requests include features like higher-kinded types (HKT), improved support for TypeVarTuple (e.g., bounds and unpacking), better generics implementation, and official support for algebraic data types (e.g., Result, Option, or Rust-like enums/sum types).\nImproved Tooling, Consistency, and Syntax: Developers asked for an official/built-in type checker that is fast and consistent, a less verbose syntax for common patterns like nullable types (? instead of | None) and callables, and better support/documentation for complex types (like nested dicts, NumPy/Pandas arrays).\nHandling of Complex/Dynamic Patterns: Specific missing capabilities include better support for typing function wrappers/decorators (e.g., using ParamSpec effectively), being able to type dynamic attributes (like those added by Django/ORMs), and improved type narrowing and control flow analysis.\nTooling Trends\nThe developer tooling landscape for Python typing continues to evolve, with both established and emerging tools shaping how engineers work.\nMypy remains the most widely used type checker, with 58% of respondents reporting using it. While this represents a slight dip from 61% in last year’s survey, Mypy still holds a dominant position in the ecosystem. At the same time, new Rust-based type checkers like Pyrefly, Ty, and Zuban are quickly gaining traction, now used by over 20% of survey participants collectively.\nThe top six most popular answers to the question, “What type checking tools do your projects use (select all that apply)?”\nWhen it comes to development environments, VS Code leads the pack as the most popular IDE among Python developers, followed by PyCharm and (Neo)vim/vim. The use of type checking tools within IDEs also mimics the popularity of the IDE themselves, with VS Code’s default (Pylance/Pyright) and PyCharm’s built-in support being the first and third most popular options respectively.\nHow Developers Learn and Get Help\nWhen it comes to learning about Python typing and getting help, developers rely on a mix of official resources, community-driven content, and AI-powered tools, a similar learning landscape to what we saw in last year’s survey.\nTop six responses to the question, “How do you learn Python typing (select all that apply)?”\nOfficial documentation remains the go-to resource for most developers. The majority of respondents reported learning about Python typing through the official docs, with 865 citing it as their primary source for learning and 891 turning to it for help. Python’s dedicated typing documentation and type checker-specific docs are also heavily used, showing that well-maintained, authoritative resources are still highly valued.\nBlog posts have climbed in popularity, now ranking as the second most common way developers learn about typing, up from third place last year. Online tutorials, code reviews, and YouTube videos also play a significant role.\nCommunity platforms are gaining traction as sources for updates and new features. Reddit, in particular, has become a key channel for discovering new developments in the type system, jumping from fifth to third place as a source for news. Email newsletters, podcasts, and Mastodon are also on the rise.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are now a notable part of the help-seeking landscape. Over 400 respondents reported using LLM chat tools, and nearly 300 use in-editor LLM suggestions when working with Python typing. \nOpportunities and Next Steps\nThe 2025 Python Typing Survey highlights the Python community’s sustained adoption of typing features and tools to support their usage. It also points to clear opportunities for continued growth and improvement, including:\nIncreasing library coverage: One of the most consistent requests from the community is for broader and deeper type annotation coverage in popular libraries. Expanding type hints across widely used packages will make static typing more practical and valuable for everyone.\nImproving documentation: While official documentation remains the top resource, there’s a strong appetite for more discoverable and accessible learning materials. Leveraging channels like newsletters, blog posts, and Reddit can help surface new features, best practices, and real-world examples to a wider audience.\nClarify tooling differences: The growing variety of type checkers and tools is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, but can also reflect a lack of consensus/standardisation and can be confusing for users. There’s an opportunity to drive more consistency between tools or provide clearer guidance on their differences and best-fit use cases.\nTo learn more about Meta Open Source, visit our website, subscribe to our YouTube channel, or follow us on Facebook, Threads, X, Bluesky and LinkedIn.\nAcknowledgements\nThis survey ran from 29th Aug to 16th Sept 2025 and received 1,241 responses in total.\nThanks to everyone who participated!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We introduced TeamCity Pipelines in March 2024 to make CI/CD setup simpler and more intuitive, without limiting what teams can build and automate. Pipelines brought a new workflow focused on a more guided configuration experience, including a visual editor with drag-and-drop dependencies, YAML for defining building routines from scratch, and a set of practical configuration flows that reduce friction in day-to-day work.\nAfter the launch, we received a lot of positive feedback about the Pipelines UX and approach. At the same time, TeamCity Enterprise users repeatedly asked when this experience would become available in the main TeamCity product.\nBringing Pipelines to TeamCity Enterprise (EAP)\nIn July 2025, we introduced Pipelines to TeamCity Enterprise in version 2025.07 as part of an Early Access Program (EAP). The goal was to test how the Pipelines experience works on regular TeamCity servers, gauge real usage and interest, and give early adopters a way to start using Pipelines on their TeamCity Enterprise instances.\nAt that stage, the Pipelines support inside TeamCity Enterprise was intentionally not enabled by default and hidden from the main UI. We did this to avoid confusing users who expect the full breadth of TeamCity capabilities everywhere in the product.\nOne TeamCity product going forward\nIn December 2025, we made a product decision to unify TeamCity Pipelines and TeamCity Enterprise into a single TeamCity offering. A single product lets us focus our engineering and design efforts in one place, deliver improvements faster, and keep the experience consistent across TeamCity Cloud and TeamCity On-Premises.\nWhat to expect next:\nThe new Pipelines experience will be available alongside classic build configurations and build chains, so teams can use them both at the same time.\nWe’ll continue expanding Pipelines to support more of TeamCity’s advanced capabilities.\nWe’ll keep improving the TeamCity user experience. \nAs a result of this change, TeamCity Pipelines is no longer offered as a separate, standalone product. Going forward, the Pipelines experience will be delivered through TeamCity Enterprise, in both the Cloud and On-Premises versions.\nWhat about TeamCity Pipelines users?\nFor existing TeamCity Pipelines users, this change was handled as an upgrade to TeamCity Cloud Enterprise. Pipelines environments were kept intact and migrated to fall under the main TeamCity Cloud Enterprise experience. Existing subscriptions and pricing remained unchanged for those users as part of the transition. This migration was communicated separately and has already been completed.\nSo what does TeamCity look like now?\nThere is now one TeamCity platform. Sign up for TeamCity Cloud Enterprise to test the integrated Pipelines experience, alongside the rest of TeamCity’s CI/CD capabilities.\nIf you’re ready to give the Pipelines EAP a try in TeamCity On-Premises, you can head over to the sign-up page or click the Join Early Access Program link in the TeamCity UI. You’ll then be shown a transparent overview of current features, limitations, and our roadmap.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and first released in 1995, Ruby arrived with a purpose that was simple but profound: to make coding more human, more intuitive, and more enjoyable. Its object-oriented model, dynamic typing, and elegant syntax offered a fresh alternative to the heavier and more complex languages of that era.\nAs Ruby marks its 30th anniversary alongside the release of Ruby 4.0, we on the RubyMine team want to reflect on the path that led the language to where it is today and honor this remarkable milestone.\nThis year, with Ruby turning 30, we’re making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, helping nurture the next generation of Ruby developers and supporting a thriving community.\nClick here to try Ruby 4.0 in RubyMine for free.\nFrom revolutionary philosophy to thriving community\nSince its inception, Ruby has been more than a set of language constructs. Matz built it around the Principle of Least Surprise, so code would read naturally and behave as developers expect. Ruby’s “Everything is an object” model and its expressive method syntax made everyday tasks clearer, while metaprogramming enabled elegant, domain-specific abstractions. The vision for the language highlights readability and flexibility, showing that the way we write code is as important as the result.\nThis philosophy spread throughout the community, emphasizing practical, elegant solutions over hype and leading to the creation of valuable tools like:\nBundler, by Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche, which enabled reliable team collaboration through dependency management. \nRSpec, initiated by Steven Baker and refined by David Chelimsky and others, which made behavior-driven testing natural to read and write. \nRuboCop, maintained by Bozhidar Batsov, which brought a shared foundation for code style and automated linting.\nTogether, these tools extended Ruby, which today is more than a language: It is a community, a set of conventions, and a mindset that values craftsmanship and expressive, maintainable code.\nThe path to modern excellence\nOver the years, Ruby has advanced to meet constantly increasing demands and evolving development paradigms. Here’s a closer look at the milestones that shaped the language.\nRuby 1.x (2003–2007)\nRuby 1.8 stabilized the language with mature libraries and solid object-oriented foundations, paving the way for early web frameworks like Rails. Ruby 1.9 introduced the YARV VM, improving speed, regex handling, and syntax. Upgrading to v1.9 cut web request times nearly in half, making Ruby practical for real applications.\nRuby 2.x (2013–2018)\nRuby 2.x boosted reliability and added features to help developers be more productive. Keyword arguments clarified method calls, refinements allowed safer class changes, and incremental GC improved performance. Enhanced libraries simplified tasks like JSON parsing and date handling, helping developers scale complex projects.\nRuby 3.x (2020–2023)\nRuby 3.x delivered on the long-promised vision of Ruby 3×3. Ractors enabled parallelism, JIT improved real-world performance, and RBS with TypeProf added static analysis and safer refactoring. The update reinforced Ruby’s readable, flexible, and productive coding philosophy.\nRuby 4.0 (2025)\nThe latest version comes with ZJIT, a method-based JIT compiler that redefines Ruby’s performance potential. It also introduces Ruby::Box, an experimental namespace-on-read mode, and notable Ractor improvements, such as Ractor::Port and safer shareable Proc objects.\nRuby’s global impact\nThe early 2000s brought a transformative moment with the release of Ruby on Rails. Created by David Heinemeier Hansson and released in 2004, Rails paired Ruby’s transparency and natural flow with a framework that emphasized convention over configuration, streamlined workflows, and rapid development. \nSuddenly, Ruby became the engine behind a new generation of web startups, proving that elegant design could coexist with productivity and scale.\nRuby’s influence quickly spread to platforms that reshaped the digital world. Here are some of the standout projects:\nGitHub, launched in 2008, relied on Rails and Ruby’s syntax to build a collaborative environment capable of handling millions of developers and repositories. \nShopify, which was created in 2006 and now boasts the title of the world’s biggest app powered by Ruby and Rails, scaled from a platform supporting small online shops to a global e-commerce powerhouse.\nAirbnb, founded in 2008, used Ruby to power dynamic booking systems, host management, and pricing algorithms, enabling the platform to expand worldwide. \nHomebrew, created by Max Howell in 2009 to simplify software installation and dependency management on macOS, was built using Ruby and serves millions of developers.\nToday, Ruby continues to be a popular choice for young startups, including Whop, a Gen‑Z marketplace, and Chime, a rapidly growing fintech company. Both of these projects leverage Ruby on Rails to build scalable and modern platforms, highlighting the framework’s enduring relevance.\nRefining the Ruby experience with RubyMine\nIntroduced by JetBrains in 2009, RubyMine was built as a dedicated IDE designed to bring the full expressive power of Ruby and Rails to developers. With deep code understanding for metaprogramming, smart navigation aligned with Rails conventions, robust testing framework support, and debugging tools, RubyMine enables developers to work efficiently while staying true to the spirit of the language.\nMore than just supporting the ecosystem, RubyMine actively helps shape it. As Ruby continues to evolve, introducing new syntax, technologies, libraries, and development approaches, RubyMine quickly adopts and supports these changes, providing developers with up-to-date, practical tooling from day one. \nBy delivering advanced static analysis, powerful refactoring tools, and a continuously updated understanding of the language, RubyMine contributes directly to Ruby’s ongoing popularity and relevance. Its design reflects Ruby itself; it’s powerful, ever-evolving, and built to make coding enjoyable. \nFinal words\nAs Ruby enters its fourth decade, we celebrate not only the language but also the people whose passion, creativity, and dedication have made it thrive. From mentors and contributors to conference organizers and Rails developers worldwide, this community embodies the spirit that keeps Ruby vibrant and evolving.\nThe RubyMine team is proud to pay tribute to both this inspiring language and the people who bring it to life.\nThe RubyMine team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Disclaimer: This article was created using AI-based writing and communication companions. With its help, the core topics of this rich and nuanced livestream were conveniently distilled into a compact blog post format.\nIn our recent JetBrains livestream, Vitaly Bragilevsky sat down with Rust expert and educator Herbert Wolverson (Ardan Labs) to talk about everything Rust developers – beginners and pros alike – are curious about. From ownership and lifetimes to salaries and async programming, here’s a recap of the best questions and insights. Watch the full livestream replay on JetBrains TV and check out the GitHub repo with Herbert’s prepared answers and code samples. Below is a short summary of the 23 questions that were covered during the livestream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1. What’s your new book about?\nMy latest book is Advanced Hands-On Rust, a follow-up to Hands-On Rust. The first book guided readers from beginner to early intermediate level, while the new one takes you further into advanced topics like generics, macros, and library design. You can find it on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or directly from the publisher’s website for an eBook version.\n“I felt like the first book got you to the end of beginner level and then stopped a little too early. This one takes you through intermediate and early advanced topics.”\n\n            \nQ2. What’s the biggest mindset shift when moving to Rust from C++, Java, or C#?\nThe biggest difference is thinking about memory. In Java or C#, the runtime handles garbage collection for you. In Rust, you explicitly manage memory – but safely. It’s closer to C++ in that sense, yet Rust prevents entire classes of bugs like data races or use-after-free.\nRust’s ownership model and smart pointers (like Box, similar to C++’s unique_ptr) give you precise control without a garbage collector. It’s a language built to make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot in the usual ways.\n“If you’re coming from Java or C#, memory sounds terrifying. You expect something horrific. But you can go days in Rust without explicitly managing memory.”\n\n            \nQ3. Is Rust really that hard to learn?\nIt used to be! Early Rust looked terrifying, full of strange symbols and lifetimes everywhere. Today, the syntax and ecosystem are much friendlier. You can build practical apps — like a small web server — without worrying about memory management at all. The learning curve still exists, but it’s much smoother thanks to improved libraries and tooling.\n“I like to teach people so that by the end of day one, they’ve already built something useful.”\n\n            \nQ4. Should I learn C first or go straight to Rust?\nYou can start with Rust directly. C is lower-level, but Rust can be used at various abstraction levels. Long term, it’s best to learn multiple languages — not for competition, but for perspective.\n“The most important thing isn’t the language — it’s that you actually learn something and build something.”\n\n            \nQ5. Will Rust gain widespread adoption soon?\nIt already is. The Linux kernel now officially includes Rust, which is a major milestone. I’m training more teams in defense, aerospace, finance, and automotive. Rust’s adoption is expanding rapidly.\n“Linux ended their Rust experiment by saying: Rust is in the kernel now. Rust is going to be around forever. I fully expect to retire and still be called back to fix Rust code.”\n\n            \nQ6. How should beginners approach learning Rust?\nA: Choose a learning style that fits you:\nBooks: Hands-On Rust, Rust in Action, Programming Rust.\nOnline Resources: The official Rust Book and Rust by Example (free on the Rust website).\nProjects: Build something small and fun — games, scripts, or web services.\nRust gives you multiple paths, so experiment and learn by doing.\n“Some people learn from books, some from videos, some by just banging their head against the wall until it works.”\n\n            \n\nQ7. What are ownership and borrowing in Rust?\nThink of it like lending your car:\nIf I move my car to you, it’s now yours — you can destroy it.\nIf I borrow it, you use it but must return it.\nThis system prevents two parts of the program from destroying the same data or accessing it unsafely. It eliminates entire classes of memory errors common in C and C++.\n“Rust makes it impossible for some other part of the program to destroy the car without either of us knowing.”\n\n            \nQ8. What does “zero-cost abstractions” mean?\nIt means you don’t pay a runtime cost for nice language features. Rust’s abstractions (like iterators, traits, and lifetimes) are compiled away — they help you write safer, clearer code without adding runtime overhead. What you write is as efficient as hand-optimized C code.\nQ9. Should I use iterators or loops?\nUse whichever you find clearer. Iterators are powerful and expressive, especially with libraries like rayon for parallelism. But if a simple for loop is more readable for you, that’s fine too. Performance is usually identical.\n“Sometimes I write iterators. Sometimes I write loops. Either is fine.”\n\n            \nQ10. Can Rust be part of polyglot systems?\nAbsolutely. Rust integrates well with other languages using FFI (Foreign Function Interface). You can, for example, link Rust with C#, Python, or even databases like LanceDB. Use Rust where performance and memory safety matter most.\n“You don’t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. You can mix Rust with C#, Java, or whatever you already have.”\n\n            \nQ11. Which book should beginners start with — Hands-On Rust or Advanced Hands-On Rust?\nStart with Hands-On Rust. It introduces concepts through game development examples. Once you’re comfortable, move on to Advanced Hands-On Rust for deeper topics like generics and macros.\nQ12. How quickly should I learn async code?\nLearn synchronous Rust first. Async Rust adds complexity under the hood — every async fn becomes a state machine. Once you’re comfortable with ownership and borrowing, move to async with frameworks like Tokio.\nQ13. Why are there no exceptions in Rust?\nRust uses Result and Option types instead of try/catch. This forces you to handle potential errors explicitly rather than ignoring them. It’s a safer and clearer model. There’s talk about adding a throw keyword, but it’s unlikely to change this core philosophy.\n“Rust wanted to make it harder to not check errors. With [Result], you at least have to acknowledge that something might have gone wrong.”\n\n            \nQ14. Why both Result and Option?\nBecause they express different ideas:\nOption = something might be missing (e.g. user not found).\nResult = something went wrong (e.g. database error). Sometimes you even see Result<Option<T>, E> — perfectly fine.\n“They’re signaling intent. That’s why they’re different.”\n\n            \nQ15. Which external crates should I learn first?\nserde – for serialization/deserialization (JSON, YAML, etc.)\ncolored – for simple CLI output formatting\nThese crates are practical and teach how macros and traits work in real use.\n“Serde is one of the crates that really got me into Rust. You add one derive and suddenly everything just works.”\n\n            \nQ16. Structs, enums, traits — when to use which?\nStructs: group related data, like classes or records.\nEnums: define a fixed set of possibilities, each possibly carrying data.\nTraits: define shared behavior (like interfaces in other languages).\nTogether, they form Rust’s type and abstraction system.\n“Enums in Rust are much more powerful than in most languages — they can carry data and work beautifully with pattern matching.”\n\n            \nQ17. What’s pattern matching and why is it important?\nRust is strongly type-driven and pattern matching is central to Rust. It’s how you unpack Result, Option, or enum types safely. The match keyword ensures you handle all cases — the compiler even warns if you miss one. It’s similar to functional languages like Haskell or OCaml.\nQ18. How to understand lifetimes easily?\nLifetimes track how long data lives to prevent dangling references. The compiler does most of the work now. If you need to write lifetime annotations manually, it’s often a sign your code is too complex. Tools like RustRover’s lifetime visualizer can help you understand them better.\n“If I have to write a lifetime annotation, I start wondering if I made something too complicated.”\n\n            \nTry RustRover\n                                                    \nQ19. When to use references vs. smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc)?\nReferences (&): temporary, non-owning access.\nBox: store large data on the heap.\nRc / Arc: reference-counted pointers for shared ownership (single- or multi-threaded).\nThey’re ways to balance ownership, safety, and performance.\n“Ownership is about who owns the data. References are about who’s allowed to look at it.”\n\n            \nQ20. Why is immutability the default in Rust?\nRust defaults to immutable variables to prevent accidental mutation — a common source of bugs. You can make variables mutable with mut when needed. It’s about safety and clarity, not restriction.\n“It stops me from shooting myself in the foot by changing a variable somewhere deep in a function.”\n\n            \nQ21. How should I organize Rust projects?\nGroup related code into modules. Use mod.rs or mod files to define structure and expose only what’s needed with pub. Larger projects can be organized into workspaces. Think of modules as logical boundaries, not just files.\nQ22. What are macros and when should beginners use them?\nMacros generate code at compile time — for example, println! is a macro.\nThey come in two kinds: declarative (macro_rules!) and procedural (derive, proc_macro). Use them when you need repetitive boilerplate or metaprogramming, but sparingly – they can make code harder to read and harder for IDEs to analyze.\n“You can do amazing things with macros. You can also do terrible things. But don’t.”\n\n            \nQ23. Will Rust ever “rust”?\nHopefully not! But like all languages, it will evolve. The team is good at deprecating old features gracefully, so the language should age well.\n“Every language ages. Rust just makes it easier to get rid of old ideas than most.”\n\n            \nRust’s learning curve is real, but its ecosystem, documentation, and community make the journey smoother than ever.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve been \tkeeping up with Java virtual threads, you already know that this hot new feature significantly improves hardware utilization for parallel I/O-bound operations. Virtual threads map multiple concurrent I/O operations to a single OS thread without blocking. The novel aspect of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to the codebase, as it provides a lightweight concurrency primitive that is compatible with the existing APIs.\nThis is, of course, great news for Java developers. Previously, achieving similar results meant writing complex callback-based pipelines or relying on reactive Java frameworks that were far from simple.\nAside from a few minor details, Java virtual threads really are as great as they sound. The API is simple and familiar, with throughput increasing by up to a few orders of magnitude. Where servers once managed only a few hundred threads, they can now handle millions.\nSo what does this mean for the rest of the ecosystem?\n\nThe state of tooling\nVirtual threads pose quite the challenge to existing Java tooling. Your UI-based thread dump viewer or debugger may now present you with millions of rows, and simply displaying them can be a struggle. And even if it succeeds, there is still a UX issue. How is the user supposed to navigate all that information?\nOr take, for example, a classic async debugging problem: Scheduler and worker code are typically called in different threads, rendering the worker’s stack trace logically incomplete. Since a task starts in one thread and fails in another, the error’s stack trace misses the path that schedules the task. And that path might be important for understanding the cause of the problem.\nAlthough the Java ecosystem has been doing a good job adapting to  change, some gaps remain. Each challenge is multifaceted and could warrant a post of its own. In the rest of this article, we’ll dive deeper into one of these challenges: thread dumps and how to use them effectively.\nThread dumps\nSpeaking of tooling and concurrency, the first thing that comes to mind is thread dumps!\nA deadlock? An unresponsive UI? Thread explosion or leak? When investigating any of these issues, a thread dump is usually the starting point. Simple yet powerful, thread dumps are one of the best tools for diagnosing multithreading problems. In the best-case scenario, thread dumps will pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. At the very least, they’ll give you an idea of where to start your investigation.\nA thread dump tool captures the state of the application at a given moment and produces a structured text report on every thread in the application. You can view the report as text or use a specialized thread dump viewer, like the one in IntelliJ IDEA:\n\nThere are several tools that can capture and view thread dumps. Despite some variance in format and scope, thread dumps produced by different tools generally appear similar.\nHere’s an example of how a thread is described in a thread dump:\n\"main\" prio=5 tid=0x000001f3c9d13000 nid=NA runnable\n  java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead(SocketInputStream.java:116)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:171)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:141)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.readBytes(StreamDecoder.java:284)\n      - locked  (a java.io.InputStreamReader)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.implRead(StreamDecoder.java:326)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.read(StreamDecoder.java:178)\nA thread dump includes the threads’ stack traces, metadata, status, and the related locks.\nVirtual thread dumps\nSince virtual threads work differently under the hood, they require dedicated support. In addition to IntelliJ IDEA, common tools for capturing virtual threads include jcmd and jstack. As mentioned above, regular thread dump tools vary in terms of format and the level of information they provide. Your preference for one tool over another may be based on your specific use case.\nThe Netflix story\nTo make this more concrete, let’s look at an example from Netflix. For those who missed this post, we highly recommend reading it. It’s a captivating technical deep dive from engineers doing impressive things in Java, and it’s also relevant for our discussion here.\nIn short, after upgrading to virtual threads, Netflix engineers discovered an issue where some endpoints stopped serving traffic even though the JVM was still running. To get a better idea of what was going on, the team analyzed locks using a heap dump (!) and reverse-engineered Java concurrency classes. This investigation revealed a deadlock related to a limitation in virtual threads. This bug was later fixed in Java 25.\nClever though their methods may have been, it’s hard to deny that a thread dump with more comprehensive information would have made the investigation much easier.\nGetting lock information for virtual threads\nIf you use IntelliJ IDEA, you’re in luck! The IntelliJ IDEA team prioritizes new Java releases, so whenever Java adds a shiny new feature, you can rest assured that the IDE will support it from the get-go. Later in this post, we’ll discuss the capabilities of IntelliJ IDEA’s thread dump tool, but for now, let’s stick to the problem.\nUsing the gist provided in the original article, we can set a breakpoint at the line that catches the deadlock and run the reproducer while debugging:\n\nWe use a breakpoint here because the gist would otherwise finish too quickly for us to capture a thread dump in time. In real-world applications, you can capture a thread dump at any moment without suspending the program. To do this, go to More | Get thread dump on the Debug tab for the target app.\nIntelliJ IDEA opens the thread dump, indicates thread statuses, groups similar threads, folds stack traces, and provides navigation back to the source code. Selecting a waiting virtual thread shows the same information as for a platform thread, including details about the acquired locks:\n\nIn this simplified example, the virtual threads synchronize on a new Object(), so finding this specific lock isn’t particularly useful. Still, the information is there – and invaluable when diagnosing real-world problems.\nSupported targets\nIntelliJ IDEA can attach to any Java or Kotlin process, whether local or remote.\nThread dumps don’t have to come from IntelliJ IDEA at all. If someone provides a dump generated with another tool, such as jcmd, IntelliJ IDEA can open and analyze it just as easily as its own native dumps. We constantly monitor the planned changes throughout the ecosystem, so you can count on support for both the earlier and recent versions.\nAnd as a bonus for Kotlin users: IntelliJ IDEA supports not only virtual threads, but Kotlin coroutines as well!\nSummary\nJava is ramping things up and bringing modern features into the domain of concurrent computations – and this is just the beginning. Structured concurrency, a paradigm shift in how Java developers reason about concurrency, is just around the corner. We’re in this together, vendors and users alike.\nWe encourage you to give thread dumps a try in IntelliJ IDEA – you’ll find that this post was only the tip of the iceberg. And our documentation is always worth a look. For feedback and feature requests, we invite you to check out the comments section or our issue tracker.\nLet us know what you think!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I struggled to get started. For ages, I kept putting off building this website, creating a new programming language for Visual Studio, and coming up with fresh color themes. Each project looked overwhelming, and I couldn’t find the time or motivation to jump in. It all just felt like too much at once.\nBut when a national holiday gave me a long weekend, I grabbed the chance to try out Copilot in Visual Studio and see how far I could get. To my surprise, I knocked out all three projects way faster and more easily than I expected. I’m sharing what I learned because I hope it inspires you to finally tackle those projects you’ve been putting off.\nIf you have some free time at the end of 2025, it might be the perfect opportunity to finally kickstart those ideas you’ve been meaning to work on.\nLet’s jump into how I kicked off the web development project.\nProject 1 – a static website\nA few years ago, I wrote a book called The Automated Home with little success. I wrote it mostly for myself and to help other smart home geeks come up with ideas and recipes for their own automations. A book isn’t a good format for that, so I’ve been wanting to turn it into a website for a long time.\nI exported the book from .docx to .txt so that I could feed it to Copilot in Visual Studio. Then I created an empty folder to hold the static website and opened it using File -> Open Folder.\nAnd then I went to the chat window and wrote a prompt to Copilot that went like this: “Turn this book into a website that should function like a book of recipes for home automation”.\nIt chewed on that for a while and a static website was slowly taking shape in front of my eyes. One file at a time added to Solution Explorer and opened in the editor.\nThe first result was pretty good. It had most of the content right, but the design, menu system, and content organization was suboptimal. My background as a web developer came in handy, because I knew what I wanted and how I wanted it. So, I started to be a lot more specific in my prompting and telling it how I wanted the CSS to look like etc.\nThe Home Automation Cookbook website\nThe AI was able to create this website in much less time than I would have been able to manually. Probably around 5x faster. I didn’t write much myself but would prompt the AI whenever I wanted a change. Only for small things would I do the coding manually.\nThe workflow was amazing, but it did involve quite a bit of waiting for Copilot to finish its tasks. That turned out great, because I was able to spend time with the family and make progress on the website at the same time.\nCheck it out at https://www.homeautomationcookbook.com\nProject 2 – a TOON language service\nI write Visual Studio extensions a lot, and this one has made it to the top of my to-do list. Mainly because of the challenge of creating a language parser and tokenizer that would work as a Visual Studio language service. TOON is a simple language, but even so, a language service requires some unique features I couldn’t find in any of the current TOON implementations in C#.\nThe TOON language inside Visual Studio\nTo provide syntax highlighting, syntax validation (squiggles), and other features, a language parser must be very fault tolerant. If you make a syntax error on line 10, you don’t want the rest of the file to lose syntax highlighting or be riddled with syntax violation errors. Most language parsers will simply throw an error if they see a syntax error and stop parsing completely.\nMy plan was to point the GitHub cloud agent to the TOON language specification and have it create the parser and based on that. I also wanted it to create unit tests based on the specification to validate the implementation was correct.\nI created a new .NET 10 Class Library project in Visual Studio 2026 and opened the Copilot chat window. The prompt I gave Copilot was something like “Based on the TOON specification (<url to spec>), create a parser and tokenizer that is suitable for use in a Visual Studio language service”.\nThe Copilot prompt for creating a TOON language parser showing the new Cloud Agent button\nOnce I clicked the Cloud Agent button to feed it my prompt, Visual Studio starts gathering the information it needs to come up with a plan. Once it does, it creates an issue on the GitHub repository with the information and then assigns GitHub’s cloud agent to the task.\nIn about 20 minutes, I received a pull request with the initial implementation by the cloud agent. It was a good first try, but more work was needed to make it work the way I wanted. I used a mix of both regular agent mode and the cloud agent to make further improvements.\nOver 600 tests created to validate the parser against the official TOON language specification\nI found that the cloud agent was most helpful when it came to isolated tasks. I could simply prompt it to begin the work in the background, while I did other work in Visual Studio. That way I had two workstreams going on in parallel and I could make headway fast.\nOnce complete, I asked the agent to make the class library into a NuGet package and set up automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions. I published the Toon Tokenizer package shortly thereafter and could now start working on the Visual Studio extension.\nThis is my wheelhouse. And once I created a new extension project, I could simply add the NuGet package and go to town. I did this part manually because I really enjoy extension development, so I wanted to do all the driving.\nThis was a super fun project, and I got to play around with the Profiler Agent to fine tune the parser performance. I also asked the agent to help find any security issues and mitigate them. It was able to find and fix some potential risks. Overall, a fantastic experience that turned out so much better than I could imagine. This was another 5-10x time saver thanks to Copilot.\nCheck out the Toon extension and parser repository.\nProject 3 – new color themes\nI’ve wanted to make some new color themes for Visual Studio for a long time. But it’s a type of extension I don’t have much experience with, so I wasn’t sure about how much effort would be required. Often, the unknown amount of time and effort is what makes me procrastinate on projects.\nTo kick this one off, I decided to use my old Blue Steel theme extension as the base. I wanted to create two solarized themes. The real challenge with this one was to map the color tokens with the right color codes. All I had was screenshots of the themes from the Solarized web page.\nIt looks like this:\nSolarized color theme from the official web page\nWith the screenshots, I asked Copilot to extract the color tokens for both the shell/environment and the code syntax colors and map them to the right color tokens in the VS XML theme file.\nThose XML files contain a bunch of categories with color tokens in each.\n<Category Name=\"Shell\" GUID=\"{73708ded-2d56-4aad-b8eb-73b20d3f4bff}\">\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"E56C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"CC6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillQuaternary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SurfaceBackgroundFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFFDF6E3\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"TextFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n</Category>\nCopilot did a fantastic job, but I had to play around with the colors a bit. There was still a bunch of manual finessing needed. But it gave me a jump start that saved me a lot of time.\nI ended up adding 6 new color themes to the Blue Steel extension.\nThe Solarized Dark color theme for Visual Studio 2026\nIf you’re interested in creating your own color theme(s) for Visual Studio, I suggest you clone the GitHub repo to get started. Make sure to change the GUID in both the .vstheme files and in the .vsixmanifest file to avoid conflicting with the original.\nIn conclusion\nIf Copilot hadn’t given me a running start, I probably wouldn’t have even started these projects. It would’ve been way more work. And honestly, it is not nearly as fun or satisfying. Seeing things come together quickly is super motivating and really helps keep you going until you finish.\nAgentic development was awesome for a lot of the work that went into these projects, but there were times I just wanted to do things the old-school way. Sometimes I just enjoy doing certain tasks myself, or it’s simply quicker to make some tweaks by hand.\nIn any event, these were fun to do. And I finally shipped what I’ve been wanting to do for so long.\nThe post How AI fixed my procrastination appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI 구독은 저절로 팀 생산성을 높여주지는 않는다.\n개인의 노하우가 휘발되지 않고 팀의 자산으로 축적되는 워크플로우를 설계하는 것이 AI 시대 리더의 핵심 역할이다.\n단계별 컨텍스트 분리 + 결정적 검증(CI) + 비결정적 판단(LLM) + 작은 변경 단위로 굴러가는 일관된 워크플로우를 팀단위로 적용할 것을 제안한다.\n개요\n코딩 에이전트가 개발의 필수 도구가 된 지금, AI를 쓰지 않는 개발자를 찾기가 오히려 어렵다. 기업들도 이 흐름에 발맞춰 OpenAI, Claude, Gemini를 종류별로 전부 구독하며 적극적인 사용을 장려한다.\n하지만 비싼 비용을 들여 AI를 구독한다고 해서 생산성이 저절로 높아지지는 않는다.\nMETR 리서치에 따르면 AI 코딩 도구를 사용했을 때 개발 완료 시간이 오히려 19% 증가했다는 결과도 있다. 개발자들은 생산성 향상을 기대했지만, 누군가에게는 아니었다.\n반면, SNS에서 자주 회자되는 프로그래밍좀비라는 개발자는 AI를 활용해 350개의 앱을 개발하고 수익화에 성공했다고 한다. 중국인 개발자 EastonDev는 10,000라인 레거시 코드를 14일 만에 리팩토링하며 테스트 커버리지, 버그, 성능 지표까지 개선했다.\n같은 도구를 쓰면서 왜 이런 생산성 차이가 생길까? 개인이 각자 알아서 AI를 사용하다 보면, 도구에 대한 이해도, 축적된 경험, 효과적인 활용법에 따라 결과가 천차만별이기 때문이다.  개발팀을 리딩하면서 느끼는 문제의식이 바로 이 지점 – 개발자, 개발조직마다 발생하는 AI 활용 역량의 편차-이다. AI 구독은 개인 능력의 상한선을 높여주지만, 그것이 곧 팀 전체의 생산성 향상을 보장하지는 않는다.\n이 글에서는 필자가 고민한 개인의 AI 활용 역량을 팀 전체의 역량으로 전환하는 방법을 제안한다.\nLLM과 Harness의 한계\n\n\n\n\nLLM의 한계는 이미 잘 알려진 내용이므로 깊이 다루지는 않겠다. 다만 트랜스포머 기반 AI에게 업무를 맡길 때 반드시 인지해야 할 본질적 한계를 짚고 넘어가보자.\n1. 컨텍스트는 유한하다\n아무리 컨텍스트 윈도우가 커져도, 긴 맥락이 필요한 작업에는 여전히 한계가 있다. 대규모 코드베이스 전체를 이해하거나, 수십 개 파일에 걸친 리팩토링을 한 번에 처리하기는 어렵다. 이를 해결하려면 맥락을 효과적으로 전달하는 별도의 방법을 고안해야 한다.\n2. 결과물은 확률적이다\n같은 프롬프트에도 매번 다른 결과가 나온다. 이는 LLM의 근본적인 생성 방식 때문이다. 창의적인 작업에서는 장점이 되지만, 일관성이 필요한 작업에서는 치명적인 단점이 된다.\n3. 환각은 피할 수 없다\nLLM은 자신 있는 어조로 틀린 정보를 생성한다. 코딩 맥락에서는 존재하지 않는 API를 호출하거나, deprecated된 문법을 최신인 것처럼 제안하거나, 아예 없는 라이브러리를 import하는 코드를 만들어낸다. 문제는 이런 환각이 그럴듯해 보인다는 것이다. 검증 없이 AI의 출력을 그대로 믿으면, 컴파일 에러는 그나마 다행이고 런타임에서나 확인하는 대형사고로 이어질 수 있다.\nHarness: 현실적인 해결책\n이러한 한계를 보완하는 여러 방법 중, 현시점 가장 제품 수준의 완성도를 보여주는 것이 Harness(Tool Use 기반의 에이전트 구조)다. Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf 같은 코딩 에이전트들이 이 방식을 채택하고 있다.\n하지만 Harness에는 유효기간이 있다.\nBitter Lesson의 교훈, Scaling Law는 여전히 유효하다. 어느 날 갑자기 Google이나 OpenAI의 신모델이 등장해, 팀이 공들여 구축한 Harness를 무용지물로 만들 수 있다. 실제로 예전에는 PDF에서 텍스트를 추출하려면 복잡한 파이프라인이 필요했지만, 이제는 멀티모달 모델에 이미지로 던지면 끝이다. 팀이 몇 주간 구축한 PDF 파싱 Harness가 하룻밤 사이에 레거시가 되어버리는 것이다.\n그럼에도 Harness를 만들어야 하는 이유\n이런 리스크에도 불구하고, 지금 당장 Harness가 제공하는 생산성 향상은 무시할 수 없다.\nHarness 없이 Raw LLM만 쓰는 것과, 잘 구성된 에이전트 환경에서 작업하는 것의 생산성 격차는 이미 크게 벌어졌다. 6개월 뒤 무용지물이 될 수 있다 해도, 그 6개월간의 생산성 이득이 구축 비용을 상회한다면 만들어야 한다.\n문제는 이 Harness를 개인이 아닌 팀 전체가 일관되게 사용하도록 만드는 것이다.\n개인의 AI 역량 ≠ 팀의 AI 역량\n\n\n\n\nAI를 잘 쓰는 개인은 많다. 하지만 그 개인이 속한 팀이 AI를 잘 쓰는가는 전혀 다른 문제다.\n팀원들에게 비싼 AI 구독을 제공한다고 해서 팀 생산성이 저절로 높아지지 않는다. 개인 단위의 AI 활용이 팀 단위의 생산성으로 전환되지 못하는 데는 구조적인 이유가 있다.\n1. 인간 지능이 병목이다\nAI의 코드 생산 속도는 인간의 리뷰 속도를 아득히 넘어선다. ITWorld의 분석에 따르면, 이는 “조립 라인에서 한 기계만 속도를 높이고 나머지를 그대로 두면, 공장이 빨라지는 것이 아니라 처리되지 못한 작업이 쌓여갈 뿐”인 상황과 같다. 코드는 10배 빨리 생성되는데, 리뷰는 여전히 사람이 일일이 해야 한다면 결국 인간 리뷰어가 병목이 될 수 밖에 없다.\n2. 검증 체계가 없다\nAI가 생성한 코드를 얼마나 신뢰할 수 있는가? 코드래빗 보고서에 따르면, AI 생성 코드는 사람이 작성한 코드보다 PR당 1.7배 더 많은 이슈를 발생시킨다. 객관적인 검증 지표와 자동화된 품질 게이트 없이는, AI 결과물에 대한 확신을 가질 수 없다.\n3. 숙련도 격차가 크다\n누군가는 정교한 프롬프트와 최적화된 에이전트 설정으로 높은 품질의 결과물을 뽑아내지만, 누군가는 기본적인 활용에도 어려움을 겪는다. 같은 도구, 같은 구독료를 내면서도 생산성 격차는 몇 배씩 벌어진다. 이 격차를 좁히는 것은 개인의 노력만으로는 한계가 있다.\n4. 경험과 노하우가 휘발된다\n가장 심각한 문제다. 비슷한 업무를 하는 팀원들이 각자 비슷한 프롬프트를 만들고, 비슷한 에이전트 구성을 시도한다. 누군가 효과적인 방법을 발견해도, 그 지식은 개인에게 머문다. 슬랙에 공유한 팁은 며칠 뒤 묻히고, 노션에 정리한 가이드는 업데이트되지 않는다. AI를 잘 쓰는 경험과 노하우가 팀에 축적되지 않고 휘발된다.\n이 네 가지 문제의 공통점은 무엇인가? AI 역량을 축적하고 공유할 워크플로우의 부재다.\n개인의 역량에 의존하는 한, 팀 전체의 AI 활용 수준은 들쭉날쭉할 수밖에 없다. 필요한 것은 개인의 경험이 팀의 자산으로 축적되고, 검증된 워크플로우가 모든 팀원에게 일관되게 적용되는 구조다.\nAI 시대, 리더가 해야 할 일\n\n\n\n\n앞으로 모든 기술 리더는 개인의 경험이 팀의 자산으로 축적되는 구조를 설계해야 한다. 이것은 비단 AI Era만 해당되는 이야기가 아니다. 다만 AI 시대에는 앞서 언급한 이 문제가 첨예해졌을 뿐이다.\n리더의 역할은 적극적으로 Harness를 구축하고, 이를 팀 워크플로우에 녹여내는 것이다. 다음은 이를 위한 다섯 가지 원칙이다.\n1. 워크플로우 단계별로 맥락을 분리하라\n하나의 거대한 프롬프트로 모든 것을 해결하려 하지 마라. 기획 검토, 설계, 구현, 테스트, 리뷰 – 각 단계는 필요로 하는 맥락이 다르다. 단계마다 적절한 컨텍스트만 전달하면 LLM의 유한한 컨텍스트 윈도우를 효율적으로 활용할 수 있고, 결과물의 품질도 높아진다.\n2. 자동화를 위한 결정적 작업(Deterministic Tasks)과 비결정적 작업(Non-Deterministic Task)을 구분하라\n모든 것에 LLM을 쓸 필요는 없다.\n결정적 작업은 규칙 기반으로 항상 같은 결과를 내야 하는 작업이다. 린팅, 포매팅, 정적 분석, 타입 체크, 보안 스캔이 여기에 해당한다. 이런 작업에 LLM을 쓰면 불필요한 비용과 불확실성만 늘어난다. 전통적인 도구가 더 빠르고, 더 정확하고, 더 일관적이다.\n비결정적 작업은 맥락 이해와 판단이 필요한 작업이다. 여기가 LLM이 진가를 발휘하는 영역이다:\nTidying: 변수명 개선, 불필요한 중복 제거 같은 작은 정리 작업\nReviewing: 잠재적 버그 탐지, 성능 이슈 지적, 컨벤션 위반 발견\n문서화: 코드 주석, README, API 문서, CHANGELOG 작성\n테스트 생성: 테스트 작성, 엣지 케이스 도출, 테스트 커버리지 확장\n결정적 작업은 전통적인 CI 파이프라인에 맡기고, LLM은 비결정적 작업에 집중시켜라.\n3. 변경 범위를 작게 유지하라\nAI가 한 번에 수천 줄을 생성할 수 있다고 해서, 매번 수천 줄을 생성해야 하는 것은 아니다. 큰 변경은 리뷰어의 인지 부하를 높이고 병목을 유발한다. 충분히 검증 가능하고, 문제가 생겨도 쉽게 롤백할 수 있는 작은 단위로 변경을 쪼개야 한다.\n그렇다고 무조건 작게만 유지하라는 것은 아니다. 핵심은 인지 부하 없이 자동 검증 가능한 범위를 찾는 것이다.\nKent Beck은 Tidy First?에서 리팩토링보다 작고 린팅보다는 의미 있는 ‘Tidying’이라는 개념을 제안한다. 예를 들어:\n가드 클로즈로 중첩 조건문 펼치기\n설명하는 변수명으로 매직 넘버 대체하기\n죽은 코드 제거하기\n함수 순서 재배치하기\n이 정도 규모의 변경은 테스트만 통과하면 별도 리뷰 없이 머지해도 된다. 워크플로우를 잘 설계하면 이런 Tidying 작업을 AI가 자동으로 수행하고, 자동으로 검증하고, 자동으로 적용하는 것이 가능하다.\n4. 인간 개입을 최소화할 수 있는 워크플로우를 만들어라\n병목은 결국 인간이다. AI의 생산 속도를 인간의 리뷰 속도가 따라갈 수 없다면, 인간 개입을 최소화하여 AI 결과물을 검증할 수 있는 자동화된 워크플로우가 필요하다.\n일반적으로 검증 워크플로우는 계층적으로 구성된다:\n1차: 결정적 검증 (CI 파이프라인)\n린팅, 포매팅, 타입 체크 통과 여부\n테스트 스위트 통과 여부\n보안 스캔, 의존성 취약점 검사\n2차: 비결정적 검증 (AI 리뷰어)\nPR이 생성되면 리뷰어 에이전트가 변경점을 분석\n잠재적 버그, 성능 이슈, 아키텍처 위반 탐지\nPR 변경의 핵심 포인트 요약 및 개선 제안\n3차: 범위 기반 자동 승인\nTidying 수준의 작은 변경 + 1차/2차 검증 통과 → 자동 머지\n버저닝을 유발하는 큰 변경 → 리뷰 생성\n여기서 Conventional Commits 규칙이 에이전트에게 힌트를 줄 수 있다. 커밋 메시지에 feat:, fix:, refactor:, chore:, docs: 같은 타입과 !(breaking change) 표시를 강제하면, AI가 변경의 성격과 영향 범위를 명확히 판단할 수 있다.\nchore: 미사용 import 제거          → 자동 머지 가능\nrefactor: 결제 로직 함수 분리      → AI 리뷰 후 자동 머지\nfeat!: 인증 API 응답 구조 변경     → 별도의 리뷰 프로세스 필요\n이렇게 구성하면 버저닝을 유발하는 큰 변경이 아닌 chore, style, docs, refactor 수준의 변경은 1차/2차 검증만 통과하면 리뷰어 에이전트가 직접 머지할 수 있다. feat!, fix! 같은 breaking change나 feat 같은 의미 있는 변경만 별도의 리뷰 프로세스를 도입하면 된다.\n이 워크플로우의 수준이 높아져서 다소 큰 변경마저도 리뷰 에이전트가 인간 지능 개입 없이 머지가능한 수준으로 고도화된다면 결국 대부분의 변경이 인간 개입 없이 자동으로 처리되고, 이 팀/프로젝트의 생산성은 큰 변곡점을 맞게 될 것이다.\n5. 모든 개선이 팀의 자산으로 축적되게 하라\n이것이 가장 중요하다.\nAI 도입은 “좋은 도구를 사주면 끝나는” 문제가 아니다. 2025 DORA 리포트는 성공적인 AI 도입을 툴 문제가 아니라 시스템 문제로 정의하며, AI의 가치는 도구 그 자체보다 주변의 기술·문화적 환경에 Lock-in 된다고 말한다.\n누군가 효과적인 프롬프트를 발견했다면, 그 프롬프트는 휘발되지 않고 팀 전체가 쓰는 도구에 반영되어야 한다. 누군가 실수를 방지하는 워크플로우를 만들었다면, 그 워크플로우는 개인의 습관이 아니라 팀의 시스템으로 자리 잡아야 한다.\n개인이 발견한 베스트 프랙티스가 → 팀의 표준 워크플로우가 되고 → 버전 관리되며 → 지속적으로 개선되는 구조.\n이 구조가 작동하려면, 조직은 명확하고 공유된 AI 스탠스(정책/기대치/허용 도구/적용 범위) 를 가져야 한다. DORA 리포트는 AI 도입의 긍정적 효과가 이런 “clear and communicated AI stance”의 존재에 의존하며, 이것이 있을 때 개인 효과와 조직 성과의 긍정적 영향이 증폭된다고 제시한다.\n이것을 가능하게 하는 것이 AI 시대 리더십의 핵심 역할이다.\n다음 편에서는 이 원칙들을 이용하여 팀을 위한 Harness를 만드는 방법, 특히 Claude Code의 Skills, Hooks, Plugins로 팀단위 워크플로우를 자동화하는 구체적인 방법을 살펴보겠다.",

GPT는 이렇게 분석된 데이터를 바탕으로 업무를 세 가지 그룹으로 최적화하여 제시합니다.\n즉시 실행 그룹: 고객사 방문, 협의 결과 정리 등 오늘 하루의 성패를 좌우할 핵심 과업. 최우선적으로 처리해야 합니다.\n계획 실행 그룹: 미팅 후 인지 피로를 고려하여 분할 실행이 필요한 업무들. 위임이나 축소가 가능한 부분은 최소한의 메모로 대체하여 에너지를 효율적으로 배분합니다.\n보류 또는 위임 그룹: 당장 급하지 않거나 타인에게 맡길 수 있는 업무.\n이렇게 명확하게 정리된 실행 순서를 보면, 복잡했던 머릿속이 싹 정리되는 느낌을 받을 수 있을 거예요. 김과장님도 이제 뭘 해야 할지 확실히 알게 되었죠!\n\n\n \nChatGPT - 지금 뭐부터?\n오늘의 할 일 목록을 입력하면 중요도·긴급도·에너지·효과 기준으로 우선순위를 정리하고 가장 효율적인 실행 순서와 선택 전략을 제안합니다. 생산성, 번아웃 방지, 집중력 관리까지 고려한\nchatgpt.com\n\n \n\n\n두 번째 인생 GPT: '리서치광' - 심층 시장 동향 보고서 완성  \n오후 5시, 김과장님은 고객사 방문을 무사히 마치고 월간 시장 동향 보고서를 작성해야 합니다. 그런데 이게 만만치 않죠. 국내외 친환경차 부품 기술 트렌드, 경쟁사 수주 현황, 심지어 원자재 가격 변동 추이까지... 솔직히 이 모든 것을 처음부터 직접 리서치하고 분석하려면 한 달은 족히 걸릴 겁니다. 특히 인테이크 매니폴드 같은 경우 알루미늄이나 플라스틱 복합재로 만들어지니, 원자재 가격이 곧 '원가'에 직결되잖아요. 이런 전문적인 내용을 빠르게 파악하고 정리하는 것이 정말 중요하죠.\n여기서 우리의 두 번째 '인생 GPT', 바로 '리서치광'이 등장합니다!\n  '리서치광' GPT, 활용의 정석\n'리서치광' GPT는 여러분의 짧은 요청 사항을 받아 마치 전문 리서치 애널리스트처럼 아주 상세하고 구조화된 프롬프트로 확장해줍니다. \"이런 관점도 보세요, 저런 데이터도 포함하세요\"라고 조언해주는 것과 같아요. 저는 이 기능에 처음 접했을 때 정말 감탄했어요. 단 세 줄의 요구사항이 체계적인 리서치 가이드로 변신하는 마법을 직접 경험해보세요!\n생성된 프롬프트를 활용하여 이제 본격적인 딥 리서치를 시작합니다. 챗GPT의 심층 리서치 기능을 활성화하고 웹 검색을 병행하며 데이터를 수집합니다. 여기서 그치지 않고, 좀 더 다양한 자료 확보를 위해 제미나이의 딥 리서치 기능도 함께 활용해보세요. 사람이 한 달 걸릴 리서치를 단 몇 분 만에 끝내는 놀라운 경험을 하게 될 거예요.\n\n\n \nChatGPT - 리서치 광 (The Research Maniac)\n모든 주제에 대해 심층리서치 전용 프롬프트로 확장합니다.\nchatgpt.com\n\n \n  리서치 결과를 프레젠테이션으로!\n리서치가 완료되면, 이 자료를 가지고 프레젠테이션을 만들어야겠죠? 제미나이에서 생성된 리서치는 자체 PDF 다운로드 기능이 없으므로, '내보내기' 기능을 통해 구글 Docs로 넘긴 후 PDF로 저장하는 것이 좋습니다. 이제 이 PDF를 구글 노트북LM에 업로드합니다.\n노트북LM에서 문서 분석이 완료되면, 우측의 '슬라이드 자료' 버튼을 활용해 \"월간 정기보고서 형식의 슬라이드 구조로 생성해줘 (프리미엄 딥 네이비 & 골드 테마)\"와 같이 요청합니다. 잠시 기다리면 시장 동향부터 기술 로드맵, 원가 분석 및 구체적인 실행 계획까지 완벽한 논리 체계와 시각 자료를 갖춘 전문 비즈니스 전략 보고서가 뚝딱 완성됩니다. 정말 놀랍죠? 저는 이 기능을 통해 보고서 작성 시간을 획기적으로 줄일 수 있었어요.\n⚠️ 주의: 노트북LM 자체에도 딥 리서치 기능이 있지만, LLM에서 실행한 리서치는 보고서 형태로 제공되는 반면, 노트북LM은 리서치된 문서들을 개별적인 소스로 가져오니 사용 목적에 따라 적절히 선택해야 합니다.\n\n\n세 번째 인생 GPT: '한장으로 가져와' - 임원을 위한 원페이지 보고서  \n이제 저녁 7시, 김과장님은 오늘 다녀온 고객사 출장 보고서를 작성합니다. 내일 아침 임원 보고가 예정되어 있으니 빠르고 정확하게 작성해야 하죠. 김과장님이 작성한 보고서는 회의 내용, 기술 사양, 일정 협의 등이 빼곡하게 담겨 있어 매우 상세합니다. 하지만 여기서 간과하지 말아야 할 점이 있습니다. 바로 '실무자 관점의 보고서'와 '임원이 원하는 보고서'는 형식이 완전히 다르다는 것!\n많은 임원들은 세부 내용보다는 \"결론이 뭐야?\", \"우리가 뭘 결정해야 해?\", \"리스크는 뭐야?\"를 빠르게 파악하고 싶어 합니다. 이런 상황에서 장황한 보고서는 오히려 역효과를 내기 쉽죠. 이럴 때 필요한 것이 바로 세 번째 '인생 GPT', '한장으로 가져와'입니다.\n  '한장으로 가져와' GPT, 의사결정의 핵심!\n이 GPT는 여러분이 작성한 상세한 출장 보고서나 회의록을 받아 경영진의 최종 판단을 이끌어내기 위한 핵심 내용으로 압축 정리해줍니다. 고객 신뢰 확보와 리스크 관리 사이의 선택지를 명확히 비교하고, 전략적 통찰과 실무적 결단력을 동시에 확인할 수 있는 자료로 탈바꿈시켜주죠.\n특히 인상 깊었던 점은, 임원 결정 요청 부분이 체크박스 형태로 제공된다는 것이었어요. 예를 들어, '양산 일정 8주 단축 결정 (A안)', '현행 유지 및 리스크 관리 강화 (B안)', '추가 검토 지시'와 같이 명확한 선택지를 제시하는 거죠. 임원 입장에서는 길게 읽을 필요 없이 핵심만 파악하고 바로 체크만 하면 되니, 의사결정 시간을 획기적으로 단축할 수 있습니다. 정말 편하겠죠? 저도 이 기능을 사용하면서 임원분들의 만족도가 확 올라가는 것을 체감했습니다.\n\n \nChatGPT - 한 장으로 가져와 GPT\n실무자가 작성한 보고서·메모·회의록을 임원이 즉시 판단할 수 있는 의사결정 중심 보고서로 재구성합니다. 결론, 선택지, 리스크, 결정 요청만 남기고 불필요한 설명은 제거합니다.\nchatgpt.com\n\n \n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1.
