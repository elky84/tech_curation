        "content:encodedSnippet": "This article is the first in a multi-part series sharing a breadth of Analytics Engineering work at Netflix, recently presented as part of our annual internal Analytics Engineering conference. We kick off with a few topics focused on how we’re empowering Netflix to efficiently produce and effectively deliver high quality, actionable analytic insights across the company. Subsequent posts will detail examples of exciting analytic engineering domain applications and aspects of the technical craft.\nAt Netflix, we seek to entertain the world by ensuring our members find the shows and movies that will thrill them. Analytics at Netflix powers everything from understanding what content will excite and bring members back for more to how we should produce and distribute a content slate that maximizes member joy. Analytics Engineers deliver these insights by establishing deep business and product partnerships; translating business challenges into solutions that unblock critical decisions; and designing, building, and maintaining end-to-end analytical systems.\nEach year, we bring the Analytics Engineering community together for an Analytics Summit — a 3-day internal conference to share analytical deliverables across Netflix, discuss analytic practice, and build relationships within the community. We covered a broad array of exciting topics and wanted to spotlight a few to give you a taste of what we’re working on across Analytics Engineering at Netflix!\nDataJunction: Unifying Experimentation and Analytics\nYian Shang, Anh Le\nAt Netflix, like in many organizations, creating and using metrics is often more complex than it should be. Metric definitions are often scattered across various databases, documentation sites, and code repositories, making it difficult for analysts and data scientists to find reliable information quickly. This fragmentation leads to inconsistencies and wastes valuable time as teams end up reinventing metrics or seeking clarification on definitions that should be standardized and readily accessible.\nEnter DataJunction (DJ). DJ acts as a central store where metric definitions can live and evolve. Once a metric owner has registered a metric into DJ, metric consumers throughout the organization can apply that same metric definition to a set of filtered records and aggregate to any dimensional grain.\nAs an example, imagine an analyst wanting to create a “Total Streaming Hours” metric. To add this metric to DJ, they need to provide two pieces of information:\n\nThe fact table that the metric comes from:\n\nSELECT\n account_id, country_iso_code, streaming_hours\nFROM streaming_fact_table\n\nThe metric expression:\n\n`SUM(streaming_hours)`\nThen metric consumers throughout the organization can call DJ to request either the SQL or the resulting data. For example,\n\ntotal_streaming_hours of each account:\n\ndj.sql(metrics=[“total_streaming_hours”], dimensions=[“account_id”]))\n\ntotal_streaming_hours of each country:\n\ndj.sql(metrics=[“total_streaming_hours”], dimensions=[“country_iso_code”]))\n\ntotal_streaming_hours of each account in the US:\n\ndj.sql(metrics=[“total_streaming_hours”], dimensions=[“country_iso_code”], filters=[“country_iso_code = ‘US’”]))\nThe key here is that DJ can perform the dimensional join on users’ behalf. If country_iso_code doesn’t already exist in the fact table, the metric owner only needs to tell DJ that account_id is the foreign key to an `users_dimension_table` (we call this process “dimension linking”). DJ then can perform the joins to bring in any requested dimensions from `users_dimension_table`.\nThe Netflix Experimentation Platform heavily leverages this feature today by treating cell assignment as just another dimension that it asks DJ to bring in. For example, to compare the average streaming hours in cell A vs cell B, the Experimentation Platform relies on DJ to bring in “cell_assignment” as a user’s dimension (no different from country_iso_code). A metric can therefore be defined once in DJ and be made available across analytics dashboards and experimentation analysis.\nDJ has a strong pedigree–there are several prior semantic layers in the industry (e.g. Minerva at Airbnb; dbt Transform, Looker, and AtScale as paid solutions). DJ stands out as an open source solution that is actively developed and stress-tested at Netflix. We’d love to see DJ easing your metric creation and consumption pain points!\nLORE: How we’re democratizing analytics at Netflix\nApurva Kansara\nAt Netflix, we rely on data and analytics to inform critical business decisions. Over time, this has resulted in large numbers of dashboard products. While such analytics products are tremendously useful, we noticed a few trends:\n\nA large portion of such products have less than 5 MAU (monthly active users)\nWe spend a tremendous amount of time building and maintaining business metrics and dimensions\nWe see inconsistencies in how a particular metric is calculated, presented, and maintained across the Data & Insights organization.\nIt is challenging to scale such bespoke solutions to ever-changing and increasingly complex business needs.\n\nAnalytics Enablement is a collection of initiatives across Data & Insights all focused on empowering Netflix analytic practitioners to efficiently produce and effectively deliver high-quality, actionable insights.\nSpecifically, these initiatives are focused on enabling analytics rather than on the activities that produce analytics (e.g., dashboarding, analysis, research, etc.).\n\nAs part of broad analytics enablement across all business domains, we invested in a chatbot to provide real insights to our end users using the power of LLM. One reason LLMs are well suited for such problems is that they tie the versatility of natural language with the power of data query to enable our business users to query data that would otherwise require sophisticated knowledge of underlying data models.\nBesides providing the end user with an instant answer in a preferred data visualization, LORE instantly learns from the user’s feedback. This allows us to teach LLM a context-rich understanding of internal business metrics that were previously locked in custom code for each of the dashboard products.\n\nSome of the challenges we run into:\n\nGaining user trust: To gain our end users’ trust, we focused on our model’s explainability. For example, LORE provides human-readable reasoning on how it arrived at the answer that users can cross-verify. LORE also provides a confidence score to our end users based on its grounding in the domain space.\nTraining: We created easy-to-provide feedback using 👍 and 👎 with a fully integrated fine-tuning loop to allow end-users to teach new domains and questions around it effectively. This allowed us to bootstrap LORE across several domains within Netflix.\n\nDemocratizing analytics can unlock the tremendous potential of data for everyone within the company. With Analytics enablement and LORE, we’ve enabled our business users to truly have a conversation with the data.\nLeveraging Foundational Platform Data to enable Cloud Efficiency Analytics\nJ Han, Pallavi Phadnis\nAt Netflix, we use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our cloud infrastructure needs, such as compute, storage, and networking to build and run the streaming platform that we love. Our ecosystem enables engineering teams to run applications and services at scale, utilizing a mix of open-source and proprietary solutions. In order to understand how efficiently we operate in this diverse technological landscape, the Data & Insights organization partners closely with our engineering teams to share key efficiency metrics, empowering internal stakeholders to make informed business decisions.\nThis is where our team, Platform DSE (Data Science Engineering), comes in to enable our engineering partners to understand what resources they’re using, how effectively they utilize those resources, and the cost associated with their resource usage. By creating curated datasets and democratizing access via a custom insights app and various integration points, downstream users can gain granular insights essential for making data-driven, cost-effective decisions for the business.\nTo address the numerous analytic needs in a scalable way, we’ve developed a two-component solution:\n\nFoundational Platform Data (FPD): This component provides a centralized data layer for all platform data, featuring a consistent data model and standardized data processing methodology. We work with different platform data providers to get inventory, ownership, and usage data for the respective platforms they own.\nCloud Efficiency Analytics (CEA): Built on top of FPD, this component offers an analytics data layer that provides time series efficiency metrics across various business use cases. Once the foundational data is ready, CEA consumes inventory, ownership, and usage data and applies the appropriate business logic to produce cost and ownership attribution at various granularities.\n\nAs the source of truth for efficiency metrics, our team’s tenants are to provide accurate, reliable, and accessible data, comprehensive documentation to navigate the complexity of the efficiency space, and well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to set expectations with downstream consumers during delays, outages, or changes.\nLooking ahead, we aim to continue onboarding platforms, striving for nearly complete cost insight coverage. We’re also exploring new use cases, such as tailored reports for platforms, predictive analytics for optimizing usage and detecting anomalies in cost, and a root cause analysis tool using LLMs.\nUltimately, our goal is to enable our engineering organization to make efficiency-conscious decisions when building and maintaining the myriad of services that allows us to enjoy Netflix as a streaming service. For more detail on our modeling approach and principles, check out this post!\nAnalytics Engineering is a key contributor to building our deep data culture at Netflix, and we are proud to have a large group of stunning colleagues that are not only applying but advancing our analytical capabilities at Netflix. The 2024 Analytics Summit continued to be a wonderful way to give visibility to one another on work across business verticals, celebrate our collective impact, and highlight what’s to come in analytics practice at Netflix.\nTo learn more, follow the Netflix Research Site, and if you are also interested in entertaining the world, have a look at our open roles!\n\nPart 1: A Survey of Analytics Engineering Work at Netflix was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "By J Han, Pallavi Phadnis\nContext\nAt Netflix, we use Amazon Web Services (AWS) for our cloud infrastructure needs, such as compute, storage, and networking to build and run the streaming platform that we love. Our ecosystem enables engineering teams to run applications and services at scale, utilizing a mix of open-source and proprietary solutions. In turn, our self-serve platforms allow teams to create and deploy, sometimes custom, workloads more efficiently. This diverse technological landscape generates extensive and rich data from various infrastructure entities, from which, data engineers and analysts collaborate to provide actionable insights to the engineering organization in a continuous feedback loop that ultimately enhances the business.\nOne crucial way in which we do this is through the democratization of highly curated data sources that sunshine usage and cost patterns across Netflix’s services and teams. The Data & Insights organization partners closely with our engineering teams to share key efficiency metrics, empowering internal stakeholders to make informed business decisions.\nData is Key\nThis is where our team, Platform DSE (Data Science Engineering), comes in to enable our engineering partners to understand what resources they’re using, how effectively and efficiently they use those resources, and the cost associated with their resource usage. We want our downstream consumers to make cost conscious decisions using our datasets.\nTo address these numerous analytic needs in a scalable way, we’ve developed a two-component solution:\n\nFoundational Platform Data (FPD): This component provides a centralized data layer for all platform data, featuring a consistent data model and standardized data processing methodology.\nCloud Efficiency Analytics (CEA): Built on top of FPD, this component offers an analytics data layer that provides time series efficiency metrics across various business use cases.\n\nFoundational Platform Data (FPD)\nWe work with different platform data providers to get inventory, ownership, and usage data for the respective platforms they own. Below is an example of how this framework applies to the Spark platform. FPD establishes data contracts with producers to ensure data quality and reliability; these contracts allow the team to leverage a common data model for ownership. The standardized data model and processing promotes scalability and consistency.\n\nCloud Efficiency Analytics (CEA Data)\nOnce the foundational data is ready, CEA consumes inventory, ownership, and usage data and applies the appropriate business logic to produce cost and ownership attribution at various granularities. The data model approach in CEA is to compartmentalize and be transparent; we want downstream consumers to understand why they’re seeing resources show up under their name/org and how those costs are calculated. Another benefit to this approach is the ability to pivot quickly as new or changes in business logic is/are introduced.\n\n* For cost accounting purposes, we resolve assets to a single owner, or distribute costs when assets are multi-tenant. However, we do also provide usage and cost at different aggregations for different consumers.\nData Principles\nAs the source of truth for efficiency metrics, our team’s tenants are to provide accurate, reliable, and accessible data, comprehensive documentation to navigate the complexity of the efficiency space, and well-defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to set expectations with downstream consumers during delays, outages or changes.\nWhile ownership and cost may seem straightforward, the complexity of the datasets is considerably high due to the breadth and scope of the business infrastructure and platform specific features. Services can have multiple owners, cost heuristics are unique to each platform, and the scale of infra data is large. As we work on expanding infrastructure coverage to all verticals of the business, we face a unique set of challenges:\nA Few Sizes to Fit the Majority\nDespite data contracts and a standardized data model on transforming upstream platform data into FPD and CEA, there is usually some degree of customization that is unique to that particular platform. As the centralized source of truth, we feel the constant tension of where to place the processing burden. Decision-making involves ongoing transparent conversations with both our data producers and consumers, frequent prioritization checks, and alignment with business needs as informed captains in this space.\nData Guarantees\nFor data correctness and trust, it’s crucial that we have audits and visibility into health metrics at each layer in the pipeline in order to investigate issues and root cause anomalies quickly. Maintaining data completeness while ensuring correctness becomes challenging due to upstream latency and required transformations to have the data ready for consumption. We continuously iterate our audits and incorporate feedback to refine and meet our SLAs.\nAbstraction Layers\nWe value people over process, and it is not uncommon for engineering teams to build custom SaaS solutions for other parts of the organization. Although this fosters innovation and improves development velocity, it can create a bit of a conundrum when it comes to understanding and interpreting usage patterns and attributing cost in a way that makes sense to the business and end consumer. With clear inventory, ownership, and usage data from FPD, and precise attribution in the analytical layer, we aim to provide metrics to downstream users regardless of whether they utilize and build on top of internal platforms or on AWS resources directly.\nFuture Forward\nLooking ahead, we aim to continue onboarding platforms to FPD and CEA, striving for nearly complete cost insight coverage in the upcoming year. Longer term, we plan to extend FPD to other areas of the business such as security and availability. We aim to move towards proactive approaches via predictive analytics and ML for optimizing usage and detecting anomalies in cost.\nUltimately, our goal is to enable our engineering organization to make efficiency-conscious decisions when building and maintaining the myriad of services that allow us to enjoy Netflix as a streaming service.\nAcknowledgments\nThe FPD and CEA work would not have been possible without the cross functional input of many outstanding colleagues and our dedicated team building these important data assets.\n—\nA bit about the authors:\nJHan enjoys nature, reading fantasy, and finding the best chocolate chip cookies and cinnamon rolls. She is adamant about writing the SQL select statement with leading commas.\nPallavi enjoys music, travel and watching astrophysics documentaries. With 15+ years working with data, she knows everything’s better with a dash of analytics and a cup of coffee!\n\nCloud Efficiency at Netflix was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Part 1: Understanding The Challenges\nBy: Varun Khaitan\nWith special thanks to my stunning colleagues: Mallika Rao, Esmir Mesic, Hugo Marques\nIntroduction\nAt Netflix, we manage over a thousand global content launches each month, backed by billions of dollars in annual investment. Ensuring the success and discoverability of each title across our platform is a top priority, as we aim to connect every story with the right audience to delight our members. To achieve this, we are committed to building robust systems that deliver comprehensive observability, enabling us to take full accountability for every title on our service.\nThe Challenge of Title Launch Observability\nAs engineers, we’re wired to track system metrics like error rates, latencies, and CPU utilization — but what about metrics that matter to a title’s success?\nConsider the following example of two different Netflix Homepages:\nSample Homepage ASample Homepage B\nTo a basic recommendation system, the two sample pages might appear equivalent as long as the viewer watches the top title. Yet, these pages couldn’t be more different. Each title represents countless hours of effort and creativity, and our systems need to honor that uniqueness.\nHow do we bridge this gap? How can we design systems that recognize these nuances and empower every title to shine and bring joy to our members?\nThe Operational Needs of a Personalization System\nIn the early days of Netflix Originals, our launch team would huddle together at midnight, manually verifying that titles appeared in all the right places. While this hands-on approach worked for a handful of titles, it quickly became clear that it couldn’t scale. As Netflix expanded globally and the volume of title launches skyrocketed, the operational challenges of maintaining this manual process became undeniable.\nOperating a personalization system for a global streaming service involves addressing numerous inquiries about why certain titles appear or fail to appear at specific times and places. \nSome examples:\n\nWhy is title X not showing on the Coming Soon row for a particular member?\nWhy is title Y missing from the search page in Brazil?\nIs title Z being displayed correctly in all product experiences as intended?\n\nAs Netflix scaled, we faced the mounting challenge of providing accurate, timely answers to increasingly complex queries about title performance and discoverability. This led to a suite of fragmented scripts, runbooks, and ad hoc solutions scattered across teams — an approach that was neither sustainable nor efficient.\nThe stakes are even higher when ensuring every title launches flawlessly. Metadata and assets must be correctly configured, data must flow seamlessly, microservices must process titles without error, and algorithms must function as intended. The complexity of these operational demands underscored the urgent need for a scalable solution.\nAutomating the Operations\nIt becomes evident over time that we need to automate our operations to scale with the business. As we thought more about this problem and possible solutions, two clear options emerged.\nOption 1: Log Processing\nLog processing offers a straightforward solution for monitoring and analyzing title launches. By logging all titles as they are displayed, we can process these logs to identify anomalies and gain insights into system performance. This approach provides a few advantages:\n\nLow burden on existing systems: Log processing imposes minimal changes to existing infrastructure. By leveraging logs, which are already generated during regular operations, we can scale observability without significant system modifications. This allows us to focus on data analysis and problem-solving rather than managing complex system changes.\nUsing the source of truth: Logs serve as a reliable “source of truth” by providing a comprehensive record of system events. They allow us to verify whether titles are presented as intended and investigate any discrepancies. This capability is crucial for ensuring our recommendation systems and user interfaces function correctly, supporting successful title launches.\n\nHowever, taking this approach also presents several challenges:\n\nCatching Issues Ahead of Time: Logging primarily addresses post-launch scenarios, as logs are generated only after titles are shown to members. To detect issues proactively, we need to simulate traffic and predict system behavior in advance. Once artificial traffic is generated, discarding the response object and relying solely on logs becomes inefficient.\nAppropriate Accuracy: Comprehensive logging requires services to log both included and excluded titles, along with reasons for exclusion. This could lead to an exponential increase in logged data. Utilizing probabilistic logging methods could compromise accuracy, making it difficult to ascertain whether a title’s absence in logs is due to exclusion or random chance.\nSLA and Cost Considerations: Our existing online logging systems do not natively support logging at the title granularity level. While reengineering these systems to accommodate this additional axis is possible, it would entail increased costs. Additionally, the time-sensitive nature of these investigations precludes the use of cold storage, which cannot meet the stringent SLAs required.\n\nOption 2: Observability Endpoints in Our Personalization Systems\nTo prioritize title launch observability, we could adopt a centralized approach. By introducing observability endpoints across all systems, we can enable real-time data flow into a dedicated microservice for title launch observability. This approach embeds observability directly into the very fabric of services managing title launches and personalization, ensuring seamless monitoring and insights. Key benefits and strategies include:\n\nReal-Time Monitoring: Observability endpoints enable real-time monitoring of system performance and title placements, allowing us to detect and address issues as they arise.\nProactive Issue Detection: By simulating future traffic(an aspect we call “time travel”) and capturing system responses ahead of time, we can preemptively identify potential issues before they impact our members or the business.\nEnhanced Accuracy: Observability endpoints provide precise data on title inclusions and exclusions, allowing us to make accurate assertions about system behavior and title visibility. It also provides us with advanced debugability information needed to fix identified issues.\nScalability and Cost Efficiency: While initial implementation required some investment, this approach ultimately offers a scalable and cost-effective solution to managing title launches at Netflix scale.\n\nChoosing this option also comes with some tradeoffs:\n\nSignificant Initial Investment: Several systems would need to create new endpoints and refactor their codebases to adopt this new method of prioritizing launches.\nSynchronization Risk: There would be a potential risk that these new endpoints may not accurately represent production behavior, thus necessitating conscious efforts to ensure all endpoints remain synchronized.\n\nUp Next\nBy adopting a comprehensive observability strategy that includes real-time monitoring, proactive issue detection, and source of truth reconciliation, we’ve significantly enhanced our ability to ensure the successful launch and discovery of titles across Netflix, enriching the global viewing experience for our members. In the next part of this series, we’ll dive into how we achieved this, sharing key technical insights and details.\nStay tuned for a closer look at the innovation behind the scenes!\n\nTitle Launch Observability at Netflix Scale was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

To understand the latest trends, challenges, and motivations driving learners, as well as other factors shaping the field, we conducted the 2024 Computer Science Learning Curve Survey. More than 23,991 learners from 16 countries and seven broader regions completed our detailed questionnaire – equivalent to over a year of collective effort. Dive in to discover what we’ve learned!\nRead the Full Report\n                                                    \nArtificial Intelligence (AI) is a magnet for new computer science learners\nWhile programming, algorithms, and databases may still dominate the curriculum, AI sparks fresh interest in computer science. Nearly 28% of learners plan to dive into AI for their next course, while 33%–34% are already exploring it – including 18% who are taking their very first steps in computer science.\nAI is democratizing computer science education\nAI-powered translation tools for learning are especially popular in regions with diverse or non-English speaking populations (Northern Eurasia, Turkey, Asia, Latin America).\nIntegrated development environments (IDEs) reign supreme, even for beginners\nContrary to the belief that beginners prefer simpler tools, 46% of learners wrote their first line of code in an IDE – outpacing text editors (28%) and browser-based editors (11%). IDE users report fewer challenges, less isolation, and lower rates of imposter syndrome, feeling better equipped to keep pace with the rapid evolution of technology without becoming overwhelmed.\nQuality assurance (QA) roles are an undervalued entry point\nDespite being a potential entry point into tech, QA/Tester remains generally less sought-after than other tech roles. However, it stands out, alongside user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designer (16%) and business analyst (14%), as a role with higher-than-average female representation in the industry.\nComputer science is about passion and creativity, not just paychecks\nPassion fuels tech learners much like it does artists or musicians. Nearly half (46%) enter computer science to tackle challenges, automate processes, or turn a hobby into a career. The drive to create – whether crafting games, websites, or innovative solutions – surpasses practical motivators like salary (41%) or remote work flexibility (34%).\nHands-on projects trump all\nA whopping 76% of learners consider hands-on projects the most important aspect of educational courses, far outweighing other factors like structured curriculum or clear learning objectives.\nWomen prioritize flexibility and support \nFemale learners value time flexibility, remote learning options, technical support, and accessible study spaces more than their male counterparts.\nProductivity-boosting strategies have regional quirks\nGetting enough sleep is the second most popular productivity booster globally, but Germans prioritize listening to music over it. North and South Americans embrace pet time – a tactic almost unheard of in Nigeria, China, South Korea, and the Middle East.\nCareer switching is a rising trend\nThe stereotypical image of a young, single male computer science learner under 30, balancing late-night coding with a software engineering day job still holds true – particularly in India and China. However, an increasing number of learners aged 30 and above are breaking the mold, transitioning into tech from diverse fields, from engineering and finance to healthcare and creative arts.\nDiscover More Insights\n                                                    \nShare, discuss and collaborate with us\nWe’re excited to collaborate with professionals from diverse fields – whether you’re an educator, developer, or researcher – for projects like hackathons, research initiatives, and more.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Testing is a crucial part of software development, verifying that a system functions as intended. Developers create unit tests to validate the behavior of individual components, isolating them from external dependencies such as file systems, databases, message brokers, and third-party APIs. However, since many applications rely on these external components, developers write integration tests to ensure an application interacts correctly with its dependencies in a more complete environment.\nIntegration testing can be challenging if developers rely on shared environments, mock systems, or manual configuration of dependencies, all of which can lead to brittle tests and undetected issues in production.\nTestcontainers for Java is an open-source Java library that provides lightweight, disposable containers as test fixtures, enabling developers to run real instances of databases, message brokers, web servers, and other dependencies during testing. By leveraging Docker, Testcontainers ensures that tests run in isolated and consistent environments, independent of the host machine’s configuration. Testcontainers integrates seamlessly with popular testing libraries like JUnit and TestNG, making it easy for developers to write integration tests.\nThis blog post covers the following topics:\nGetting started with Testcontainers\nWriting tests with Testcontainers and JUnit 5\nTesting Spring Data JPA repositories using Testcontainers\nTesting Spring Boot REST APIs using Testcontainers\nLet’s get started by setting up Testcontainers. If you already know how to do that, feel free to skip ahead to the Writing tests with Testcontainers and JUnit 5 section.\nGetting started with Testcontainers\nThe Testcontainers library provides a higher-level API to manage the container life cycle, extract information about running containers, and more. While it is predominantly used for testing, Testcontainers can also be used for local development.\nThe Testcontainers library needs a container runtime to create the container instances. To find the supporting container runtimes, see this doc.\nLet’s look at how you can use the Testcontainers API to create a Redis Docker container instance using a GenericContainer abstraction.\nFirst, add the testcontainers dependency to your build file:\n// Gradle build.gradle\ntestImplementation 'org.testcontainers:testcontainers:1.20.4'\n\n//Maven pom.xml\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n   <artifactId>testcontainers</artifactId>\n   <version>1.20.4</version>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nNow, you can use the GenericContainer API to create a container from the redis:7 Docker image exposing the container’s port 6379 to the host and use the container as follows:\nimport org.testcontainers.containers.GenericContainer;\n\n\nGenericContainer<?> container = new GenericContainer<>(\"redis:7\").withExposedPorts(6379);\ncontainer.start();\nString host = container.getHost();\nint hostPort = container.getMappedPort(6379);\nSystem.out.println(\"Redis started on \" + host + \":\" + hostPort);\ncontainer.stop();\nTestcontainers maps the exposed container ports to randomly available ports on the host machine so there won’t be any conflicts with other containers running in parallel. You can use the container.getMappedPort(port) method to get the mapped port on the host machine.\nThe GenericContainer provides a generic API for managing containers, but it doesn’t provide any container-specific methods. To streamline working with various technologies, Testcontainers offers technology-specific modules and additional API methods. You can see the full list of available Testcontainers modules here.\nNow, let’s look at how you can use the Testcontainers PostgreSQL module and the additional methods it provides.\nAdd the Testcontainer postgresql module dependency to your build file:\n// Gradle build.gradle\ntestImplementation 'org.testcontainers:postgresql:1.20.4'\n\n//Maven pom.xml\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n   <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>\n   <version>1.20.4</version>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nNow, you can use the PostgreSQLContainer class to create an instance of a PostgreSQL container:\nPostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>(\"postgres:17\");\npostgres.start();\n\nhost = postgres.getHost();\nhostPort = postgres.getMappedPort(5432);\n//If you expose only one port, then you can use getFirstMappedPort()\nhostPort = postgres.getFirstMappedPort();\n\n// container-specific methods\nString jdbcUrl = postgres.getJdbcUrl();\nString username = postgres.getUsername();\nString password = postgres.getPassword();\nString databaseName = postgres.getDatabaseName();\n\npostgres.stop();\nPostgreSQLContainer abstracts the details of the container port number, database credentials, and readiness checks and provides you with a high-level API to interact with it. You can also see that this class provides additional methods to get information about the PostgreSQL container, such as getJdbcUrl() and getDatabaseName().\nNOTE: Even if you don’t explicitly destroy the containers by calling the container.stop() method, Testcontainers will automatically destroy the container upon exiting the JVM or by using the Moby Ryuk sidecar container behind the scenes.\nNow that we’ve explored setting up the Testcontainers library to create, start, and stop Docker containers, as well as extract information about them, let’s see how to use Testcontainers for testing.\nWriting tests with Testcontainers and JUnit 5\nTypically, the Testcontainers library is used for integration testing in conjunction with testing libraries like JUnit. The components, such as databases and message brokers, that are required for tests will be started before running any test cases​​ and destroyed after the test execution is completed.\nYou can use JUnit test life cycle callback methods to start and stop the containers:\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.AfterAll;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeAll;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer;\n\nclass TestcontainersWithJunit5Callbacks {\n   static PostgreSQLContainer postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer(\"postgres:17\");\n  \n   @BeforeAll\n   static void beforeAll() {\n       postgres.start();\n       // configure your application to talk to the PostgreSQL container\n   }\n\n   @AfterAll\n   static void afterAll() {\n       postgres.stop();\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   void test1() {\n       // test code that uses postgres\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   void test2() {\n       // test code that uses postgres\n   }\n}\nA common practice is starting the containers before test execution and destroying those containers after test execution is completed. The Testcontainers JUnit 5 Jupiter extension is created to simplify this process by using an annotation-based approach.\nFirst, add the following Testcontainers junit-jupiter dependency:\n// Gradle build.gradle\ntestImplementation 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter:1.20.4'\n\n//Maven pom.xml\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n   <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>\n   <version>1.20.4</version>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nNow, you can write integration tests using the Testcontainers JUnit Jupiter extension:\nimport org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;\nimport org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Testcontainers;\n\n@Testcontainers\nclass TestcontainersWithJuperExtension {\n  \n   @Container\n   static PostgreSQLContainer postgres =\n           new PostgreSQLContainer(\"postgres:17\");\n\n   @Test\n   void test1() {\n       // test talking to postgres\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   void test2() {\n       // test talking to postgres\n   }\n}\nBy adding the @Testcontainers annotation on the class and @Container annotation on the container declaration field, JUnit will automatically start the container before running tests and automatically destroy it after the test has been executed.\nNOTE: When you use the @Container annotation on static container declarations, like in the example above, only one instance of that container is created for all test cases within a single test class. If you want to create a separate instance for each test case, make it a non-static field. Remember that spinning up a new container instance for every test case is not recommended, as it slows down the test execution.\nIntegration testing Spring Boot applications using Testcontainers\nWhile Testcontainers can be used with any Java application, frameworks like Spring Boot provide out-of-the-box support for Testcontainers to make integration testing easier.\nLet’s explore how you can test Spring Data JPA repositories and Spring Boot REST APIs that use a PostgreSQL database with Testcontainers.\nIf you want to learn how to build a Spring Boot REST API with Spring Data JPA, PostgreSQL, and Flyway, read the following blog posts:\nHow to Build a CRUD REST API Using Spring Boot \nHow to Use Flyway for Database Migrations in Spring Boot Applications\n\n\n\n\nLet’s use the bookmarks Spring Boot application that was created in the above blog posts and write tests for the Spring Data JPA repository and REST API using Testcontainers.\nFirst, clone the flyway branch of the bookmarks repository and create a new branch called testcontainers. The flyway branch uses Flyway database migrations to manage database schema changes.\n$ git clone --branch flyway https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/bookmarks.git\n$ git checkout -b testcontainers\nNow, add the following Testcontainers PostgreSQL module and junit-jupiter dependencies:\n// Gradle build.gradle\ntestImplementation 'org.testcontainers:postgresql'\ntestImplementation 'org.testcontainers:junit-jupiter'\n\n//Maven pom.xml\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n   <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.testcontainers</groupId>\n   <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nSpring Boot provides slice test annotations such as @DataJpaTest, @DataMongoTest, and @WebMvcTest to test a slice of the application. By using these slice test annotations, you can write tests that load only the necessary components of the application. To write integration tests, Spring Boot’s @SpringBootTest annotation bootstraps the entire application context, loading all the components.\nTesting Spring Data JPA repositories\nHere’s the BookmarkRepository interface within the bookmarks project:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\nimport java.util.List;\nimport java.util.Optional;\n\npublic interface BookmarkRepository extends JpaRepository<Bookmark, Long> {\n List<BookmarkInfo> findAllByOrderByCreatedAtDesc();\n\n Optional<BookmarkInfo> findBookmarkById(Long id);\n}\nA common mistake when testing repositories is using an in-memory database like H2 for testing while using a different type of database like PostgreSQL or Oracle Database in production. There is no guarantee that the implementation that worked with an in-memory database will work in the same way with other databases. Additionally, the in-memory database may not have all the features provided by your production database and vice versa.\nFor example, the following is a valid query for PostgreSQL:\nINSERT INTO items(id, code, name) VALUES(?,?,?) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;\nHowever, this query doesn’t work with the H2 database by default. Executing the above query with the H2 database results in the following exception:\nCaused by: org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Syntax error in SQL statement \"INSERT INTO items (id, code, name) VALUES (?, ?, ?) ON[*] CONFLICT DO NOTHING\";\"\nFurthermore, the H2 database supports the ROWNUM() function, whereas PostgreSQL does not.\nTo ensure consistent behavior between testing and production, using the same database type is recommended. Testcontainers is useful because it facilitates this approach.\nNow, let’s write tests for the BookmarkRepository using the @DataJpaTest slice test annotation using Testcontainers:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.orm.jpa.DataJpaTest;\nimport org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertyRegistry;\nimport org.springframework.test.context.DynamicPropertySource;\nimport org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer;\nimport org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Container;\nimport org.testcontainers.junit.jupiter.Testcontainers;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\n\n@DataJpaTest\n@Testcontainers\nclass BookmarkRepositoryTest {\n   @Container\n   static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>(\"postgres:17\");\n\n   @DynamicPropertySource\n   static void configureProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {\n       registry.add(\"spring.datasource.url\", postgres::getJdbcUrl);\n       registry.add(\"spring.datasource.username\", postgres::getUsername);\n       registry.add(\"spring.datasource.password\", postgres::getPassword);\n   }\n\n   @Autowired\n   BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n\n   @Test\n   void shouldFindBookmarkById() {\n       var bookmark = new Bookmark(\"JetBrains Blog\",\"https://blog.jetbrains.com\");\n       Long bookmarkId = bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark).getId();\n\n       var bookmarkInfo = bookmarkRepository.findBookmarkById(bookmarkId).orElseThrow();\n       assertThat(bookmarkInfo.getTitle()).isEqualTo(\"JetBrains Blog\");\n       assertThat(bookmarkInfo.getUrl()).isEqualTo(\"https://blog.jetbrains.com\");\n   }\n}\nWe are using the @Testcontainers and @Container annotations to start the PostgreSQL container before running tests and destroying it afterward. Once the PostgreSQL container is started, we can configure our Spring Boot application data source properties to connect to the PostgreSQL container using @DynamicPropertySource – this allows us to override the default properties.\nIf you run the test, you can see that a PostgreSQL container starts, and the test executes against the PostgreSQL database container.\nSpring Boot 3.1.0 introduced ServiceConnection support, simplifying the usage of Testcontainers for testing and local development. To use this feature, add the following dependency:\n// Gradle build.gradle\ntestImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-testcontainers'\n\n//Maven pom.xml\n<dependency>\n   <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n   <artifactId>spring-boot-testcontainers</artifactId>\n   <scope>test</scope>\n</dependency>\nNow, let’s update the BookmarkRepositoryTest to use the ServiceConnection support:\nimport org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection;\n\n@DataJpaTest\n@Testcontainers\nclass BookmarkRepositoryTest {\n   \n   @Container\n   @ServiceConnection\n   static PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgres = new PostgreSQLContainer<>(\"postgres:17\");\n\n   @Autowired\n   BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n\n   @Test\n   void shouldFindBookmarkById() {\n       //...\n   }\n}\nBy adding the @ServiceConnection annotation to the container field definition, Spring Boot will automatically configure the data source properties pointing to the PostgreSQL database container. There is no need to explicitly configure the data source properties using @DynamicPropertySource.\nIf you create a Spring Boot project with PostgreSQL and Testcontainers dependencies, a class with the name TestcontainersConfiguration will be created under the src/test/java directory:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.TestConfiguration;\nimport org.springframework.boot.testcontainers.service.connection.ServiceConnection;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;\nimport org.testcontainers.containers.PostgreSQLContainer;\nimport org.testcontainers.utility.DockerImageName;\n\n@TestConfiguration(proxyBeanMethods = false)\nclass TestcontainersConfiguration {\n\n   @Bean\n   @ServiceConnection\n   PostgreSQLContainer<?> postgresContainer() {\n      return new PostgreSQLContainer<>(DockerImageName.parse(\"postgres:17\"));\n   }\n}\nIf you introduce Testcontainers in an existing application, you need to manually create this class.\nInstead of defining the PostgreSQLContainer in each test class, you can import the TestcontainersConfiguration class and use it in your test:\n@DataJpaTest\n@Import(TestcontainersConfiguration.class)\nclass BookmarkRepositoryTest {\n\n   @Autowired\n   BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n\n   @Test\n   void shouldFindBookmarkById() {\n       //...\n   }\n}\nThe PostgreSQLContainer bean definition and the @ServiceConnection annotation defined in TestcontainersConfiguration will take care of spinning up a PostgreSQL database container and configure the application to connect to that database.\nTesting Spring Boot REST APIs\nWhile slice tests are valuable, integration tests with real dependencies, like databases and message brokers, are crucial for verifying overall system behavior.\nSimilar to how we used Testcontainers to test Spring Data JPA repositories, you can write integration tests with the @SpringBootTest annotation and use Testcontainers to spin up the dependencies required by your application.\nIn the bookmarks application, there is the GET /api/bookmarks API endpoint, which returns all the bookmarks ordered from newest to oldest.\nLet’s write an integration test to test this endpoint:\npackage com.jetbrains.bookmarks;\n\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\nimport static org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT;\n\n@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = RANDOM_PORT)\n@Import(TestcontainersConfiguration.class)\nclass BookmarkControllerTest {\n\n   @Autowired\n   private TestRestTemplate restTemplate;\n\n   @Autowired\n   private BookmarkRepository bookmarkRepository;\n\n   @BeforeEach\n   void setUp() {\n       bookmarkRepository.deleteAllInBatch();\n   }\n\n   @Test\n   void shouldGetAllBookmarks() {\n       bookmarkRepository.save(new Bookmark(\"JetBrains Blog\",\"https://blog.jetbrains.com\"));\n       bookmarkRepository.save(new Bookmark(\"IntelliJ IDEA Blog\",\"https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/\"));\n\n       Bookmark[] bookmarks = restTemplate.getForObject(\"/api/bookmarks\", Bookmark[].class);\n\n       assertThat(bookmarks.length).isEqualTo(2);\n       assertThat(bookmarks[0].getTitle()).isEqualTo(\"IntelliJ IDEA Blog\");\n       assertThat(bookmarks[1].getTitle()).isEqualTo(\"JetBrains Blog\");\n   }\n}\nWe used the @SpringBootTest annotation, which loads the entire application context and is configured to start the server on a random available port on the host machine. We also imported the TestcontainersConfiguration class so that the required dependencies (in our case, PostgreSQL) are provisioned using Testcontainers. We then autowired TestRestTemplate to make calls to our API endpoints. We also deleted all existing bookmarks before running tests using the setUp() JUnit callback method, so we have fresh data for each test run.\nIn the test case, we saved two new bookmarks and fetched them, invoking the GET /api/bookmarks endpoint, and asserting the expected results.\nYou can find the complete code here.\nConclusion\nTestcontainers helps you test applications using real dependencies instead of relying on mock objects or in-memory alternatives, giving you more confidence in your test suite and your application’s behavior. Additionally, Spring Boot’s out-of-the-box support for Testcontainers makes it even easier to write integration tests.\nSpring Boot’s @ServiceConnection support is available for the most commonly used technologies. Even if there is no direct support provided by Spring Boot, you can use the Testcontainers GenericContainer abstraction to work with any containerized dependency. You can find more information about Testcontainers and its features here.",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2024/12/dbt/",
        "pubDate": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:58:55 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "dbt Core is a modern data transformation framework. It doesn’t extract or load data and is only responsible for the T in the ELT (extract-load-transform) process. dbt connects to your data warehouse and helps you prepare your data so it can later be used to answer business questions.\nIn this blog post, we’ll talk about the top benefits of dbt and the advantages of using it in PyCharm Professional. To make the most of these features, you should be familiar with the framework. If you know SQL well, you’ll likely find it easy to use, and if you are a total novice in the field, you can use the dbt portal to get acquainted with it.\nWhy you should use dbt\nModularity and code reusability – Transformations can be saved into modular, reusable models. For instance, in this example the model int_count_customer.sql has a reference to stg_day_customer.sql and reuses its code.\n\n\n\n\n\nVersioning – dbt projects can be stored in version control systems like Git or GitHub. This allows you to track changes, collaborate with other team members, and maintain a record of all transformations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTesting – dbt allows you to write tests for your data models easily and check whether the data has any duplicates or null values. Additionally, you can even create specific rules to test against, and you can perform tests on both the model and the project levels.\n\n\n\n\n\nDocumentation – dbt auto-generates documentation for data models, ensuring that team members and stakeholders all understand the data lineage and model definitions in the same way.\n\n\n\n\nTo summarize, dbt brings best practices in engineering to the field of data analysis, allowing you to produce higher-quality results while providing you with a straightforward and intuitive workflow.\nThese benefits are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what the tool can do.\nHow PyCharm streamlines your dbt workflow\nHaving established the benefits of dbt, we can now turn to the 7 key reasons to use it in PyCharm:\n1. User-friendly onboarding – PyCharm streamlines the initial setup. As demonstrated in this video, setting up a project and configuring the necessary settings is straightforward. \n\n\n\n\n2. Unified workspace for databases and dbt – PyCharm’s integrated database plugin powered by JetBrains DataGrip makes handling SQL databases significantly easier. Since it’s compatible with all databases that dbt works with, you don’t have to worry about juggling multiple tools. You can focus on data modeling and instantly view outcomes all in one place. To cover even a small number of the plugin’s features would take hours, but luckily we have a nice set of webinars dedicated to PyCharm’s functionality for databases:  Visual SQL Development with PyCharm.\n\n\n\n\n3. Git and dbt integration – In one interface, you can easily clone the repo, track any changes, manage branches, resolve conflicts, and collaborate with teammates.\n\n\n\n\n4. Autocompletion for your .yml  and jinja-template SQL files – People love using PyCharm because of its smart autocompletion, which it, of course, offers for dbt as well.\n\n\n\n\n5. Local history –This feature lets you undo recent changes if they cause problems. You can also compare different versions to see what was changed and check whether updates were made correctly.\n\n\n\n\n6. AI Assistant – AI Assistant is really helpful, especially if you’re just starting with dbt Core.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Large Bazel projects are becoming increasingly common in modern software development. Unfortunately, the IDE experience for these projects often leaves much to be desired. In this blog post, we’ll explore the new JetBrains Bazel plugin and how it can enhance your daily work with Bazel projects. We’ll begin with an overview of what Bazel users typically expect from IDEs and then dive into the features you can start using right away.\nBazel in your IDE\nBazel is a fast, scalable, and extensible build and test system that helps you manage complex codebases efficiently. It works with multi-language projects, offering support for C++, Java, Kotlin, Python, Rust, and other languages, and ensures consistent, reproducible builds across environments. With incremental build capabilities that recompile only what’s necessary and rich caching and parallel execution features, Bazel significantly enhances performance. Designed with extensibility in mind, it allows you to define custom build rules and scales seamlessly for monorepos and large-scale projects.\nWhen it comes to Bazel support in IDEs, a variety of features are essential for streamlining workflows and boosting productivity. Seamless integration with Bazel configuration files (such as BUILD, MODULE.bazel, and WORKSPACE files) is a key requirement, with crucial support including syntax highlighting, code completion, and error checking to simplify the creation and maintenance of build rules. IDEs should also manage dependencies intelligently, automatically resolving them to ensure accurate project structures and robust code navigation, refactoring, and search capabilities.\nIncremental build execution is another critical feature, enabling you to trigger and monitor Bazel builds directly from the IDE while leveraging performance-oriented features such as incremental compilation. Integrated test support is equally important, allowing developers to run and debug Bazel tests with tools like breakpoints and test filters. For multi-language projects, IDEs must handle cross-language dependencies effectively to ensure a smooth workflow.\nSupport for custom Bazel rules and plugins is extremely valuable, as it lets developers tailor the build process without sacrificing IDE functionality. Efficient indexing and caching are also essential for maintaining responsiveness, especially in large monorepos or with complex configurations. Finally, seamless integration with complementary tools like debuggers and profilers creates a cohesive and efficient development environment. These capabilities allow you to focus on writing code while Bazel manages the complexities of builds and dependencies.\nIntroducing our sample project\nTo demonstrate the features available in the JetBrains Bazel plugin and help you get started with it, we’ll take a look at the CLI implementation of an oversimplified calculator. Despite its simplicity, this calculator has evolved over years of development into a large monorepo with an advanced architecture, containing six packages implemented in Java and Kotlin – the languages the plugin currently supports:\n\n\n\n\nFrom this diagram, you can see that some packages are nested while others are on the first level. The calc_core package serves as the foundation, with every other package in the project depending on it. Some packages, such as kotlin-div and kotlin-sub, can be developed independently of others, but they still require a dependency on calc_core. The developer of kotlin-div has also provided JUnit 5 tests that can be executed using Bazel. Tests for calc_add, on the other hand, are generated by Bazel.\nFor this project, we use the Bzlmod approach. The Bazel-related files are located within the project as follows:\n.\n├── .bazelrc\n├── BUILD\n├── MODULE.bazel\n├── calc_cli\n│   ├── BUILD\n│   ├── rules.bzl\n│   └── src\n├── calc_core\n│   ├── BUILD\n│   ├── operations\n│   │   ├── addition\n│   │   │   ├── BUILD\n│   │   │   ├── gen_tests.bzl\n│   │   │   └── src\n│   │   └── multiplication\n│   │   \t├── BUILD\n│   │   \t└── src\n│   └── src\n├── calc_div\n│   ├── BUILD\n│   └── src\n└── calc_sub\n    ├── BUILD\n    └── src\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have MODULE.bazel (which defines the whole Bazel repository), a collection of BUILD files defining various targets, and files with rule definitions (*.bzl) here and there. \nWorking with a Bazel project in IntelliJ IDEA\nLet’s install the JetBrains Bazel plugin and see how it can assist by exploring the most common workflows in Bazel projects.\nOpening the project: Exploring the structure and project views\nWhen we first open our Bazel project in IntelliJ IDEA, the Bazel plugin works with both Bazel and IDE to map Bazel packages onto IntelliJ IDEA’s workspace model. The JetBrains Bazel plugin aims to minimize the time required for the initial sync by waiting until a later stage to load all dependencies and metadata.\nHere’s what we get as a result:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA’s ability to properly recognize the project structure significantly enhances its performance for routine tasks like code completion and navigation. Several tools are available to help us examine the structure, including the Project tool window’s Packages view and the Bazel tool window:\n\n\n\n\nThe Bazel tool window gives us access to the project-wide operations (such as resyncing, building, and configuring) and lists all the Bazel targets discovered during the latest sync. At some point, we might be interested in a subset of targets, for example tests, or in filtering targets by name:\n\n\n\n\nThe filtered target view can be plain or hierarchical, and when searching through targets, we can use case-sensitive prompts or regular expressions. \nEven with the improved mapping of Bazel projects onto the IntelliJ IDEA workspace, very large projects might be too big for IDE support. For those cases, we support project views, special configuration files that restrict the area for which the IDE is responsible. \nWhen you open a Bazel project without .bazelproject files, the JetBrains Bazel plugin creates a default view in the .bazelbsp  directory. Alternatively, you can create one yourself, for example, projectview.bazelproject:\nderive_targets_from_directories: true\ndirectories: .\nHere, we include all the project’s directories and derive all the targets from them.\nFor another example, with the following div-dev.bazelproject file, we can create a project view that provides support to only the directories needed for developers working on a Kotlin library that implements a division operation for our calculator:\nderive_targets_from_directories: true\ndirectories:\n  calc_div\n  calc_core\n  -calc_core/operations\nThese declarations mean that we include only two directories: calc_div and calc_core (excluding everything below calc_core/operations). Setting derive_targets_from_directories to true instructs the plugin also to include all the targets found in the specified directories. \nLet’s put the div-dev.bazelproject file in the root folder of the project and execute the Load Project View action:\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the following subset of targets becomes available in the project, while the previous subset becomes unavailable:\n\n\n\n\nReducing IDE support for packages outside the project view in this way should improve performance. \nIn general, you can have more than one project view file in the root folder of your project. The one that is currently in effect is highlighted in the Project tool window:\n\n\n\n\nTo get back to the full project, we can load the default .bazelbsp/.bazelproject file or the  projectview.bazelproject file we created earlier. Switching between project views may take some time because it requires resyncing the whole project.\nEditing, building, running, debugging, and testing\nOnce IntelliJ IDEA has loaded all the information from the Bazel configuration, we can use the IDE as usual. Among other things, project configuration makes it possible to provide a smoother code editing experience, as the IDE is aware of available libraries, provides meaningful completion suggestions, and supports navigation through the codebase:\n\n\n\n\nWe can also use Bazel to run or debug an application or test:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother option is to run a test from the Bazel tool window:\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Bazel tool window, we can also initiate a build for a particular target or jump to the corresponding BUILD file to tweak any configuration options:\n\n\n\n\nReconfiguring or extending the project\nChanges in Bazel configuration files might require the project to be resynced with IntelliJ IDEA. The plugin detects such changes and suggests syncing with the IDE:\n\n\n\n\nAdding files or packages to our repository is also detected and requires syncing for IntelliJ IDEA to work correctly. \nWorking with Starlark code\nThe JetBrains Bazel plugin also provides code completion, navigation, and debugging support for Starlark code. \nIn the following two screenshots, we change the name of tests generated for the addition operation, set a breakpoint, and launch a Starlark debugging session. Once we’re suspended on the breakpoint, we can inspect the available variables, and then we can continue the debugging session by using Step Into or Step Over or resuming execution. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen debugging Starlark code, it’s always helpful to remember that Bazel checks if there are any changes since the last time the code was executed. Before we can start debugging, we need to have changed something in the corresponding files. \nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we’ve reviewed how the JetBrains Bazel plugin integrates Bazel projects into IntelliJ IDEA, covering everything from project setup to debugging Starlark code. The plugin provides tools to help manage large and complex codebases, such as project views, target filtering, and incremental builds.\nThese features aim to simplify working with Bazel projects by improving navigation, build management, and test execution within the IDE. While it may require some initial setup, the plugin can make handling Bazel configurations and workflows more straightforward over time.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Reusing content is one of the few things that software developers and technical writers are equally passionate about. Both know that avoiding duplication isn’t just a good practice, it’s essential – and it works for documentation, just as it does for code:\nDecreased redundancy: Reusing content eliminates the need to write the same information multiple times, saving time and costs for authors and editors.\nReduced localization costs: Reusing content also means translators only need to work on unique text, lowering translation costs across all localized versions.\nFaster updates: Changes made to a reusable snippet propagate to all topics where it’s included, making your sources more maintainable and reducing the chance of errors or outdated information slipping in. \nImproved consistency: Reusing content ensures consistent terminology, tone, and style across documents – and consistency is the foundation of clarity.\nReduced carbon footprint: Eliminating duplicates reduces the demand for storage space on servers as well as clearing your project from unused images and topics.\n\n\n\n\nWhen should you start reusing content in technical documentation? The general advice is simple: as soon as you’ve outgrown your first README file. At that point, your content is likely getting more complex, more people are contributing to the docs, and the risk of inconsistencies, errors, and redundancy is increasing. \nReusing content requires effort to avoid certain perils and pitfalls, especially when you have a family of products built on the same platform, as is the case of JetBrains. Writerside actively develops features that make content reuse easier and more fail-safe.\nDownload Writerside\n                                    \n\n\n\n\nReusing content with Writerside\nAny piece of content with an ID can be reused in Writerside – a content snippet, an entire topic, or even a hierarchy of topics from a table of contents.\nTopic level: Any topic can be included in multiple instances. Instances can be used to produce documentation for multiple products with shared functionality or different outputs for the same content (web or PDF), as well as to tailor product information for different audiences, or even to maintain separate versions of a documentation site. \nTable of contents level: You can include entire sections of a table of contents so that you don’t have to reproduce the same hierarchy of topics in multiple instances.\nSnippet level: You can reuse any chunk of content – a sentence fragment, an entire element such as a warning, or a larger block of text like a procedure, chapter, or table. \nYou can find more details in the docs.\nNew: Introducing libraries\nLibraries are containers for reusable content snippets. You can have a single library with all your snippets, but multiple libraries might be more useful if your source base is large or if you have multiple content authors managing different product areas. In this EAP release, we’ve improved library management. \nNow Writerside has a dedicated view where you can add the libraries you use most often and organize them in a hierarchy to group them by topic:\n\n\n\n\nHowever, some core problems of content reuse still remain.\nAre there duplicates in my docs?\nAm I rewriting something that’s already been written?\nWill my changes to reused content break other parts of my source base? \nHow can I create, find, and include text snippets more efficiently?\nIn the upcoming releases, we plan to tackle these challenges – hopefully, with your help! \nJoin our Slack community, subscribe to product updates, and share your ideas and experience about content reuse with us.\nSubscribe to Writerside product updates\n                                                                Join Slack\n                                    \nBut wait, there’s more!\nReusable content and libraries aren’t the only things that kept us busy this past month. We’ve also listened to your feedback and fixed a handful of bugs and usability issues, such as making sure that the Save image dialog opens when you drag and drop an image into a topic, and more.\n👉 Read the full release notes\nIt’s been a big year full of development, both for Writerside and the industry. The pace of progress has been so high that we haven’t had a chance to appreciate what we’ve accomplished. We’re already looking ahead to next year, the next EAP, and the next set of challenges and opportunities waiting to be tackled.\nWe wish you all the best, and we’ll see you soon!\nThe Writerside team",

        "pubDate": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 13:43:02 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are pleased to announce the public Early Access Program (EAP) of the new Bazel plugin for IntelliJ IDEA. It is available on JetBrains Marketplace for IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3. This initial release supports Bazel projects focusing exclusively on Java and Kotlin. Support for more languages including Python, Go, and Scala is coming soon, while C++ is a bit further down the road.\nBazel has become a popular build tool among large organizations struggling with the sheer size of their code repositories, which often consist of hundreds of thousands of files and are sometimes even too large to load on a single laptop. Bazel is one of the few tools capable of working on this level efficiently. Other key features include the ability to build artifacts in a fully reproducible way and work with codebases using multiple languages.\nFor these reasons we are investing in bringing great Bazel support to IntelliJ IDEA and our other IDEs. So far, we have done this by supporting the development and maintenance of the original Bazel plugin by Google. This release is the first step in delivering several fundamental improvements that would have been hard to implement in the scope of the original plugin. While it is not at parity yet with the original plugin in all features, we are aiming to provide the full functionality in 2025.\nLike the original plugin, the new plugin is free and open-source. We welcome contributions on our GitHub repository. As the plugin matures, we may decide to make some advanced features available only to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate customers, but all essential functionality will remain open.\nCheck out the Getting Started with the JetBrains Bazel Plugin post to learn about first steps, or read up on the main features on our documentation page.\nA look back\nTwo years ago, we identified a trend towards monorepos and Bazel among our enterprise users. Bazel support for IntelliJ IDEA was already available through the original Bazel plugin by Google. While it is stable, it did not address many use cases for users outside of Google, and some of them would have required major incompatible changes to the codebase. We chose to maintain the original plugin while trying new approaches in our new plugin.\nWhat’s different\nUnder the hood, we implemented a nearly 1:1 mapping of Bazel targets to IntelliJ modules. In the process of implementation, we prepared the IntelliJ Platform and language features for performing at the scale of typical Bazel projects – commonly hundreds of thousands of source files and targets. The fine-grained mapping allows an accurate representation of the project structure in the IDE, eliminating problems caused by conflicting dependency paths or completions outside the actual import scope in the original Bazel plugin.\nOn the user-visible side, we streamlined the import flow. Instead of stepping through an import wizard to select the working set, you simply choose a directory, BUILD file, or project view of your monorepo to import. The IDE will load only the chosen subset of the repository. Additionally, we support the project view mechanism introduced in the original plugin, which lets you define the exact project subset to work on in terms of targets or directories.\nThe target tree lets you easily search, build, run, or test individual Bazel targets.\nLooking forward\nAs the new plugin reaches stability and feature parity, we plan to gradually transition to maintaining only the new plugin. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring a smooth and seamless transition without disrupting your current workflows. \nAs we reach predefined quality gates, we will begin to phase out support for the original Bazel plugin. The phase-out will depend on the maturity of the new plugin implementation for each supported ecosystem individually: JVM, Go, Python, C++, and Android.\nTimeline\nWe will provide regular compatibility updates for the original plugin throughout 2025, including critical fixes and support for new IntelliJ IDEA versions.\nAt the moment, we plan to have stable IDE integration in the new plugin for JVM, Go, and Python before Q3 2025 (July). When the quality gates are passed, we will begin phasing out our support involvement over a period of six months. After the phase-out period, we may stop providing updates.\nWe expect CLion support to take longer and are targeting the end of 2025. Until then, the original plugin for CLion will continue to receive full support, and then, in early 2026, we will begin a six-month phase-out period.\nEven after we phase out our support, the original plugin will still be available on the JetBrains Marketplace but will not receive further updates.\nQuality gates\nWe defined the following necessary quality gates to pass before beginning the phase-out. We are working closely with several customers to ensure that they are met:\nThe new plugin covers essential use cases of 3-5 pilot customer teams or companies\nPilot users don’t experience degradations in usability in comparison to the original plugin, in any supported OS (MacOS, Linux, Windows)\nBenchmarks against real codebases show stable and adequate performance in sync times\nAutomated end-to-end tests and regular manual tests ensure a reliable release process\nRoadmap\nBy Q2 2025 (April), we plan to deliver stable support for the JVM ecosystem, including Scala.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) has been a popular solution for remote development, but it is not without challenges. At JetBrains, we’ve recently seen growing interest in Cloud Development Environments (CDEs) as an alternative. \nTo understand why many are thinking about this shift, we contacted our customers and uncovered the key reasons behind the trend. In this blog post, we’ll share what we learned.\nTL;DR: VDIs can be helpful for specific use cases, but CDEs are a better choice for software development.\nWhat are VDIs and CDEs?\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) is a technology that manages and delivers remote machines, typically virtual ones, to end-users. Users interact with these machines via protocols like RDP, PCoIP, or HDX, which stream the desktop interface to the user’s device. So, technically, VDI uses video streaming to provide a full desktop experience but in a remote environment. This means the remote machine can be used for any purpose, like web browsing, video conferencing, software development, etc.\nCompanies use solutions like Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, VMware Horizon, and others to manage VDI environments (VDIs).\nCloud Development Environments (CDEs) are a newer concept purpose-built for software development. Usually, a CDE is a Docker container or a virtual machine created from a template that specifies the image, repository, environment variables, secrets, and more. \nUnlike VDIs, CDEs are designed to be ephemeral, meaning they can be created, used, and destroyed quickly. A developer can create multiple CDEs for different tasks with only the IDE backend running remotely. Communication with the CDE happens via a local client over an efficient JetBrains Remote Development Protocol (in the case of JetBrains IDEs) developed specifically for that case. It makes mouse movement, typing, and the overall experience with the code editor much more pleasant.\nTo manage CDEs, you need a CDE orchestration solution like JetBrains CodeCanvas.\nWhy companies use VDIs and why they’re looking to switch to CDEs\nDuring our interviews, we identified the most significant reasons companies use VDIs and why they\naren’t always the best choice for software development. We won’t discuss all the pros and cons of VDIs and CDEs, but we’ll focus on the most common pain points.\n1. Security\n\n\n\n\nSecurity is, without question, the primary motivator for companies to adopt VDIs. While other factors are often cited as benefits of remote development, they are rarely the primary drivers. VDIs provide an out-of-the-box solution for high security requirements.\nHowever, while CDEs require more effort to set up (e.g. integrating with third-party tools), they offer more flexibility and cloud-native security features.\n💡See also: Should Your Company Adopt Remote Development?\nWhy do companies choose VDIs?\nVDIs excel in security:\nCentralized access control: VDIs provide centralized, user-level access control. Typically integrated with systems like Active Directory, user accounts are managed centrally, and their permissions define what resources they can access on their assigned VDI machines. For example, if a user has the necessary credentials to clone a repository, they can do so directly from their VDI environment. The VDI serves as a general-purpose entry point to the organization’s infrastructure – the fact that a user creates a VDI machine doesn’t mean they have started working on a specific project.\nPreventing code leaks: No source code is stored on local machines, and copying code via the clipboard, file transfer, and screen capture can be disabled.\nSecure access to internal resources: VDI environments typically operate within the company’s network, granting access to internal resources like databases or internal services without exposing them to the internet.\nWhat can CDEs offer?\nCDEs can match VDIs in security and even offer additional advantages, but they might require more effort:\nCentralized access control: CDEs also offer centralized access control, often integrated with external providers like Active Directory. However, CDEs add another layer of control through template-based access. For example, in CodeCanvas, a CDE template defines everything a developer needs for a project: the Git repository, required secrets, environment variables, etc. \nThe resulting CDE contains only the resources necessary for a specific project, contrasting with a VDI machine, which typically grants general access. For administrators, this provides additional visibility into developer activity, making it clear which developers are working on specific projects, when they started, and how long they’ve been working.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevent code leaks: No code is stored on the local machine. Clipboard restrictions can be implemented at the IDE level, but additional protections, such as file transfer and screen capture restrictions, may require third-party tools.\nSecure access to internal resources: As CDEs are deployed in the company’s cloud, it’s easy to organize secure access to internal cloud resources. For example, CodeCanvas lets you link Kubernetes service accounts to specific templates, granting developers automatic access to required cloud resources without manual configurations or permissions.\n2. Environment standardization\n\n\n\n\nThe second most common reason for adopting remote development and VDIs is the desire to standardize environments across teams. While VDIs offer some level of standardization, CDEs take it to the next level.\nWhy do companies choose VDI?\nVDIs offer some standardization:\nPersistent environments and configuration drift: These are essentially personal remote machines tied to individual users. Standardization is achieved by setting up a golden image – a pre-configured baseline environment. However, users treat these environments as personal machines over time, installing additional software or making changes that lead to configuration drift and works-on-my-machine issues. \nNon-persistent environments and state loss: These reset to the golden image state after each session. This ensures consistency, but fails in software development since all uncommitted changes are lost when the session ends.\nHybrid environments: Some VDIs offer hybrid approaches to preserving state, such as detaching and reattaching user disks, but these are complex to set up and maintain.\nWhat can CDEs offer?\nCDEs offer much better standardization:\nEphemeral environments: CDEs aren’t user-specific but project-specific. They are ephemeral – they’re created when needed and discarded after use. Standardization is achieved via templates that define the base image with tools, a Git repository, environment variables, etc. In CodeCanvas, standardization goes even further:\n\nYou can pre-configure the dev environment’s IDE with plugins and personal settings.\nYou can use the warm-up feature – CodeCanvas pre-creates IDE indexes, builds the project, fetches dependencies, and stores the result as a single volume snapshot. This snapshot is then distributed across all CDEs based on the same template. If you schedule the warm-up task overnight, in the morning, every new dev environment will be ready to go with prebuilt artifacts and a fully indexed IDE.\nNo configuration drift: Since CDEs are ephemeral and recreated from templates for each task, developers can’t make persistent changes that deviate from the standard.\nPreserved state: CDEs can be paused and resumed, preserving the state of the environment, including uncommitted changes. In solutions like CodeCanvas, storage is unmounted when the environment is stopped and remounted when it is resumed.\n3. Developer experience\n\n\n\n\nThe developer experience is an unavoidable topic in any discussion about remote development. We haven’t met a customer who was satisfied with VDIs in this regard. One of the core issues is that VDIs were never designed for software development.\nWhat can VDIs offer?\nVDIs offer traditional local machine workflows. VDIs were originally designed to replicate traditional desktops in a remote environment, focusing on general user applications rather than specific software development needs.\nLatency and performance issues: In every single interview we conducted, this was the top complaint from VDI users. VDIs rely on protocols like RDP, PCoIP, or HDX to stream the entire desktop interface to the user’s device. This approach highly depends on network quality and struggles to maintain the responsiveness needed for software development, where frequent keystrokes and rapid code navigation are common.\n“When it was a good day, the quality was decent – almost like working locally, except that I couldn’t use a dual-monitor setup. But most days? Typing was laggy, and image quality was poor. It was frustrating.”\nResource limitations: VDI environments are often under-provisioned for development tasks. Compiling large projects or running intensive tests can strain shared VDI servers.\nOne environment, many tasks: Developers typically work on multiple tasks using the same VDI environment. This means manually checking out different branches, installing dependencies, and waiting for the IDE to index the project each time they switch tasks.\nWhat can CDEs offer?\nCDEs offer a modern, task-oriented workflow. They fundamentally shift the remote development paradigm by being project-specific and using optimized communication protocols.\nLatency and performance issues: Instead of streaming the entire desktop interface, only the IDE backend runs remotely, communicating with the local client via highly efficient data protocols. These protocols are far less bandwidth-intensive than video streaming, though they also require a stable network connection (latency below 100ms).\nResource limitations: CDEs are ephemeral and can be provisioned with the exact resources and configuration needed for a specific project. As CDEs rely on cloud infrastructure, they are limited only by the cloud provider’s instance types. Moreover, with solutions like CodeCanvas, it’s possible to provision environments with GPU instances for tasks like ML model training.\nOne environment, one task: CDEs shift the focus from single user-centric machines. For example, CodeCanvas is built around the concept of short-lived environments. Developers create a new environment for each task: bug fixing, feature development, or code review. \nThe environment is fully pre-configured for the task (e.g. with the correct branch checked out, dependencies installed, and the indexes built) and is ready to use. After the task is done, the environment is deleted.\n\n\n\n\n4. Costs\n\n\n\n\nVDIs are notorious for their high costs, and one of the most common questions we hear from customers is whether switching to CDEs will save money. However, this question has no straightforward answer, as it depends on many factors.\nWhat can VDIs offer?\nVDIs have high fixed costs with not-always-efficient resource utilization:\nPersistent VMs: VDIs are often set up with persistent VMs, allocating resources even when the machine is unused. In some cases, companies leave machines running 24/7 to avoid the overhead of starting and stopping them.\nInfrastructure costs: The infrastructure required to run VDIs (servers, storage, networking) demands significant upfront investments. Scaling up adds further ongoing costs.\nWhat can CDEs offer?\nCDEs offer cost optimization. While CDEs rely on cloud infrastructure, which is inherently expensive, they offer more efficient resource usage. Environments are created on demand, and once they’re stopped, the resources are deallocated. CodeCanvas, for example, includes several features to optimize costs:\nAuto-shutdown: CodeCanvas automatically stops idle environments.\nStorage optimization: CodeCanvas can convert volumes of stopped environments from expensive block storage to cheaper object storage, further optimizing costs.\nAlthough these measures can help reduce costs, let’s be realistic: Cloud infrastructure isn’t cheap, and the overall infrastructure bill for CDEs may not always be lower than for VDIs. \nHowever, the actual savings with CDEs often come from reducing non-productive time rather than direct infrastructure costs. With CDEs, developers get ready-to-work environments, allowing them to start coding immediately without waiting for the environment to be set up.\nKey takeaways\nVDIs have their place in a wide variety of use cases, such as strict security policies and general-purpose remote desktops. However, they fall short in software development due to their limitations in UI responsiveness, standardization, developer workflow, and cost efficiency. CDEs, on the other hand, are purpose-built for software development, offering:\nAn improved developer experience with low-latency communication protocols.\nTask-specific, ephemeral environments.\nPreconfigured templates for standardization.\nWhile switching from VDIs to CDEs requires effort and investment, the long-term benefits to developer productivity, standardization, and cost efficiency make it a worthwhile transition. If you’re considering migrating from VDIs to CDEs, we recommend starting with a pilot project to evaluate the new approach’s benefits and challenges.\nFor more information on CDEs and how JetBrains can help you transition, visit the CodeCanvas product page and contact our team.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular ways to analyze text. It allows us to see at a glance how people are feeling across a wide range of areas and has useful applications in fields like customer service, market and product research, and competitive analysis.\nLike any area of natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis can get complex. Luckily, Python has excellent packages and tools that make this branch of NLP much more approachable.\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore some of the most popular packages for analyzing sentiment in Python, how they work, and how you can train your own sentiment analysis model using state-of-the-art techniques. We’ll also look at some PyCharm features that make working with these packages easier and faster.\nWhat is sentiment analysis?\nSentiment analysis is the process of analyzing a piece of text to determine its emotional tone. As you can probably see from this definition, sentiment analysis is a very broad field that incorporates a wide variety of methods within the field of natural language processing.\nThere are many ways to define “emotional tone”. The most commonly used methods determine the valence or polarity of a piece of text – that is, how positive or negative the sentiment expressed in a text is. Emotional tone is also usually treated as a text classification problem, where text is categorized as either positive or negative.\nTake the following Amazon product review:\n\n\n\n\nThis is obviously not a happy customer, and sentiment analysis techniques would classify this review as negative.\nContrast this with a much more satisfied buyer:\n\n\n\n\nThis time, sentiment analysis techniques would classify this as positive.\nDifferent types of sentiment analysis\nThere are multiple ways of extracting emotional information from text. Let’s review a few of the most important ones.\nWays of defining sentiment\nFirst, sentiment analysis approaches have several different ways of defining sentiment or emotion.\nBinary: This is where the valence of a document is divided into two categories, either positive or negative, as with the SST-2 dataset. Related to this are classifications of valence that add a neutral class (where a text expresses no sentiment about a topic) or even a conflict class (where a text expresses both positive and negative sentiment about a topic).\nSome sentiment analyzers use a related measure to classify texts into subjective or objective.\nFine-grained: This term describes several different ways of approaching sentiment analysis, but here it refers to breaking down positive and negative valence into a Likert scale. A well-known example of this is the SST-5 dataset, which uses a five-point Likert scale with the classes very positive, positive, neutral, negative, and very negative.\nContinuous: The valence of a piece of text can also be measured continuously, with scores indicating how positive or negative the sentiment of the writer was. For example, the VADER sentiment analyzer gives a piece of text a score between –1 (strongly negative) and 1 (strongly positive), with scores close to 0 indicating a neutral sentiment.\nEmotion-based: Also known as emotion detection or emotion identification, this approach attempts to detect the specific emotion being expressed in a piece of text. You can approach this in two ways. Categorical emotion detection tries to classify the sentiment expressed by a text into one of a handful of discrete emotions, usually based on the Ekman model, which includes anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise. A number of datasets exist for this type of emotion detection. Dimensional emotional detection is less commonly used in sentiment analysis and instead tries to measure three emotional aspects of a piece of text: polarity, arousal (how exciting a feeling is), and dominance (how restricted the emotional expression is).\nLevels of analysis\nWe can also consider different levels at which we can analyze a piece of text. To understand this better, let’s consider another review of the coffee maker:\n\n\n\n\nDocument-level: This is the most basic level of analysis, where one sentiment for an entire piece of text will be returned. Document-level analysis might be fine for very short pieces of text, such as Tweets, but can give misleading answers if there is any mixed sentiment. For example, if we based the sentiment analysis for this review on the whole document, it would likely be classified as neutral or conflict, as we have two opposing sentiments about the same coffee machine.\nSentence-level: This is where the sentiment for each sentence is predicted separately. For the coffee machine review, sentence-level analysis would tell us that the reviewer felt positively about some parts of the product but negatively about others. However, this analysis doesn’t tell us what things the reviewer liked and disliked about the coffee machine.\nAspect-based: This type of sentiment analysis dives deeper into a piece of text and tries to understand the sentiment of users about specific aspects. For our review of the coffee maker, the reviewer mentioned two aspects: appearance and noise. By extracting these aspects, we have more information about what the user specifically did and did not like. They had a positive sentiment about the machine’s appearance but a negative sentiment about the noise it made.\nCoupling sentiment analysis with other NLP techniques\nIntent-based: In this final type of sentiment analysis, the text is classified in two ways: in terms of the sentiment being expressed, and the topic of the text. For example, if a telecommunication company receives a ticket complaining about how often their service goes down, they could classify the text intent or topic as service reliability and the sentiment as negative. As with aspect-based sentiment analysis, this analysis gives the company much more information than knowing whether their customers are generally happy or unhappy.\nApplications of sentiment analysis\nBy now, you can probably already think of some potential use cases for sentiment analysis. Basically, it can be used anywhere that you could get text feedback or opinions about a topic. Organizations or individuals can use sentiment analysis to do social media monitoring and see how people feel about a brand, government entity, or topic.\nCustomer feedback analysis can be used to find out the sentiments expressed in feedback or tickets. Product reviews can be analyzed to see how satisfied or dissatisfied people are with a company’s products. Finally, sentiment analysis can be a key component in market research and competitive analysis, where how people feel about emerging trends, features, and competitors can help guide a company’s strategies.\nHow does sentiment analysis work?\nAt a general level, sentiment analysis operates by linking words (or, in more sophisticated models, the overall tone of a text) to an emotion. The most common approaches to sentiment analysis fall into one of the three methods below.\nLexicon-based approaches\nThese methods rely on a lexicon that includes sentiment scores for a range of words. They combine these scores using a set of rules to get the overall sentiment for a piece of text. These methods tend to be very fast and also have the advantage of yielding more fine-grained continuous sentiment scores. However, as the lexicons need to be handcrafted, they can be time-consuming and expensive to produce.\nMachine learning models\nThese methods train a machine learning model, most commonly a Naive Bayes classifier, on a dataset that contains text and their sentiment labels, such as movie reviews. In this model, texts are generally classified as positive, negative, and sometimes neutral. These models also tend to be very fast, but as they usually don’t take into account the relationship between words in the input, they may struggle with more complex texts that involve qualifiers and negations.\nLarge language models\nThese methods rely on fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer-based large language model on the same datasets used to train the machine learning classifiers mentioned earlier. These sophisticated models are capable of modeling complex relationships between words in a piece of text but tend to be slower than the other two methods.\nSentiment analysis in Python\nPython has a rich ecosystem of packages for NLP, meaning you are spoiled for choice when doing sentiment analysis in this language.\nLet’s review some of the most popular Python packages for sentiment analysis.\nThe best Python libraries for sentiment analysis\nVADER\nVADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) is a popular lexicon-based sentiment analyzer. Built into the powerful NLTK package, this analyzer returns four sentiment scores: the degree to which the text was positive, neutral, or negative, as well as a compound sentiment score. The positive, neutral, and negative scores range from 0 to 1 and indicate the proportion of the text that was positive, neutral, or negative. The compound score ranges from –1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive) and indicates the overall sentiment valence of the text.\nLet’s look at a basic example of how it works:\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nimport nltk\nWe first need to download the VADER lexicon.\nnltk.download('vader_lexicon')\nWe can then instantiate the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer() and extract the sentiment scores using the polarity_scores() method.\nanalyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n\nsentence = \"I love PyCharm! It's my favorite Python IDE.\"\nsentiment_scores = analyzer.polarity_scores(sentence)\nprint(sentiment_scores)\n{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.572, 'pos': 0.428, 'compound': 0.6696}\nWe can see that VADER has given this piece of text an overall sentiment score of 0.67 and classified its contents as 43% positive, 57% neutral, and 0% negative.\nVADER works by looking up the sentiment scores for each word in its lexicon and combining them using a nuanced set of rules. For example, qualifiers can increase or decrease the intensity of a word’s sentiment, so a qualifier such as “a bit” before a word would decrease the sentiment intensity, but “extremely” would amplify it.\nVADER’s lexicon includes abbreviations such as “smh” (shaking my head) and emojis, making it particularly suitable for social media text. VADER’s main limitation is that it doesn’t work for languages other than English, but you can use projects such as vader-multi as an alternative. I wrote about how VADER works if you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into this package.\nNLTK\nAdditionally, you can use NLTK to train your own machine learning-based sentiment classifier, using classifiers from scikit-learn.\nThere are many ways of processing the text to feed into these models, but the simplest way is doing it based on the words that are present in the text, a type of text modeling called the bag-of-words approach. The most straightforward type of bag-of-words modeling is binary vectorisation, where each word is treated as a feature, with the value of that feature being either 0 or 1 (whether the word is absent or present in the text, respectively).\nIf you’re new to working with text data and NLP, and you’d like more information about how text can be converted into inputs for machine learning models, I gave a talk on this topic that provides a gentle introduction.\nYou can see an example in the NLTK documentation, where a Naive Bayes classifier is trained to predict whether a piece of text is subjective or objective. In this example, they add an additional negation qualifier to some of the terms based on rules which indicate whether that word or character is likely involved in negating a sentiment expressed elsewhere in the text. Real Python also has a sentiment analysis tutorial on training your own classifiers using NLTK, if you want to learn more about this topic.\nPattern and TextBlob\nThe Pattern package provides another lexicon-based approach to analyzing sentiment. It uses the SentiWordNet lexicon, where each synonym group (synset) from WordNet is assigned a score for positivity, negativity, and objectivity. The positive and negative scores for each word are combined using a series of rules to give a final polarity score. Similarly, the objectivity score for each word is combined to give a final subjectivity score.\nAs WordNet contains part-of-speech information, the rules can take into account whether adjectives or adverbs preceding a word modify its sentiment. The ruleset also considers negations, exclamation marks, and emojis, and even includes some rules to handle idioms and sarcasm.\nHowever, Pattern as a standalone library is only compatible with Python 3.6. As such, the most common way to use Pattern is through TextBlob. By default, the TextBlob sentiment analyzer uses its own implementation of the Pattern library to generate sentiment scores.\nLet’s have a look at this in action:\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nYou can see that we run the TextBlob method over our text, and then extract the sentiment using the sentiment attribute.\npattern_blob = TextBlob(\"I love PyCharm! It's my favorite Python IDE.\")\nsentiment = pattern_blob.sentiment\n\nprint(f\"Polarity: {sentiment.polarity}\")\nprint(f\"Subjectivity: {sentiment.subjectivity}\")\nPolarity: 0.625\nSubjectivity: 0.6\nFor our example sentence, Pattern in TextBlob gives us a polarity score of 0.625 (relatively close to the score given by VADER), and a subjectivity score of 0.6.\nBut there’s also a second way of getting sentiment scores in TextBlob. This package also includes a pre-trained Naive Bayes classifier, which will label a piece of text as either positive or negative, and give you the probability of the text being either positive or negative.\nTo use this method, we first need to download both the punkt module and the movie-reviews dataset from NLTK, which is used to train this model.\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('movie_reviews')\nnltk.download('punkt')\n\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nfrom textblob.sentiments import NaiveBayesAnalyzer\nOnce again, we need to run TextBlob over our text, but this time we add the argument analyzer=NaiveBayesAnalyzer(). Then, as before, we use the sentiment attribute to extract the sentiment scores.\nnb_blob = TextBlob(\"I love PyCharm! It's my favorite Python IDE.\", analyzer=NaiveBayesAnalyzer())\nsentiment = nb_blob.sentiment\nprint(sentiment)\nSentiment(classification='pos', p_pos=0.5851800554016624, p_neg=0.4148199445983381)\nThis time we end up with a label of pos (positive), with the model predicting that the text has a 59% probability of being positive and a 41% probability of being negative.\nspaCy\nAnother option is to use spaCy for sentiment analysis. spaCy is another popular package for NLP in Python, and has a wide range of options for processing text.\nThe first method is by using the spacytextblob plugin to use the TextBlob sentiment analyzer as part of your spaCy pipeline. Before you can do this, you’ll first need to install both spacy and spacytextblob and download the appropriate language model.\nimport spacy\nimport spacy.cli\nfrom spacytextblob.spacytextblob import SpacyTextBlob\n\nspacy.cli.download(\"en_core_web_sm\")\nWe then load in this language model and add spacytextblob to our text processing pipeline. TextBlob can be used through spaCy’s pipe method, which means we can include it as part of a more complex text processing pipeline, including preprocessing steps such as part-of-speech tagging, lemmatization, and named-entity recognition. Preprocessing can normalize and enrich text, helping downstream models to get the most information out of the text inputs.\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\nnlp.add_pipe('spacytextblob')\nFor now, we’ll just analyze our sample sentence without preprocessing:\ndoc = nlp(\"I love PyCharm! It's my favorite Python IDE.\")\n\nprint('Polarity: ', doc._.polarity)\nprint('Subjectivity: ', doc._.subjectivity)\nPolarity:  0.625\nSubjectivity:  0.6\nWe get the same results as when using TextBlob above.\nA second way we can do sentiment analysis in spaCy is by training our own model using the TextCategorizer class. This allows you to train a range of spaCY created models using a sentiment analysis training set. Again, as this can be used as part of the spaCy pipeline, you have many options for pre-processing your text before training your model.\nFinally, you can use large language models to do sentiment analysis through spacy-llm. This allows you to prompt a variety of proprietary large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, and Google to perform sentiment analysis over your texts.\nThis approach works slightly differently from the other methods we’ve discussed. Instead of training the model, we can use generalist models like GPT-4 to predict the sentiment of a text. You can do this either through zero-shot learning (where a prompt but no examples are passed to the model) or few-shot learning (where a prompt and a number of examples are passed to the model).\nTransformers\nThe final Python package for sentiment analysis we’ll discuss is Transformers from Hugging Face.\nHugging Face hosts all major open-source LLMs for free use (among other models, including computer vision and audio models), and provides a platform for training, deploying, and sharing these models. Its Transformers package offers a wide range of functionality (including sentiment analysis) for working with the LLMs hosted by Hugging Face.\nUnderstanding the results of sentiment analyzers\nNow that we’ve covered all of the ways you can do sentiment analysis in Python, you might be wondering, “How can I apply this to my own data?”\nTo understand this, let’s use PyCharm to compare two packages, VADER and TextBlob. Their multiple sentiment scores offer us a few different perspectives on our data. We’ll use these packages to analyze the Amazon reviews dataset.\nPyCharm Professional is a powerful Python IDE for data science that supports advanced Python code completion, inspections and debugging, rich databases, Jupyter, Git, Conda, and more – all out of the box. In addition to these, you’ll also get incredibly useful features like our DataFrame Column Statistics and Chart View, as well as Hugging Face integrations that make working with LLMs much quicker and easier. In this blog post, we’ll explore PyCharm’s advanced features for working with dataframes, which will allow us to get a quick overview of how our sentiment scores are distributed between the two packages.\nIf you’re now ready to get started on your own sentiment analysis project, you can activate your free three-month subscription to PyCharm.

We can use the load_dataset() method from the Datasets package to download this data from the Hugging Face Hub.\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\namazon = load_dataset(\"fancyzhx/amazon_polarity\")\nYou can hover over the name of the dataset to see the Hugging Face dataset card right inside PyCharm, providing you with a convenient way to get information about Hugging Face assets without leaving the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWe can see the contents of this dataset here:\namazon\nDatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['label', 'title', 'content'],\n        num_rows: 3600000\n    })\n    test: Dataset({\n        features: ['label', 'title', 'content'],\n        num_rows: 400000\n    })\n})\nThe training dataset has 3.6 million observations, and the test dataset contains 400,000. We’ll be working with the training dataset in this tutorial.\nWe’ll now load in the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer and the TextBlob method.\nfrom nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download(\"vader_lexicon\")\n\nanalyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\nfrom textblob import TextBlob\nThe training dataset has too many observations to comfortably visualize, so we’ll take a random sample of 1,000 reviews to represent the general sentiment of all the reviewers.\nfrom random import sample\nsample_reviews = sample(amazon[\"train\"][\"content\"], 1000)\nLet’s now get the VADER and TextBlob scores for each of these reviews. We’ll loop over each review text, run them through the sentiment analyzers, and then attach the scores to a dedicated list.\nvader_neg = []\nvader_neu = []\nvader_pos = []\nvader_compound = []\ntextblob_polarity = []\ntextblob_subjectivity = []\n\nfor review in sample_reviews:\n   vader_sent = analyzer.polarity_scores(review)\n   vader_neg += [vader_sent[\"neg\"]]\n   vader_neu += [vader_sent[\"neu\"]]\n   vader_pos += [vader_sent[\"pos\"]]\n   vader_compound += [vader_sent[\"compound\"]]\n  \n   textblob_sent = TextBlob(review).sentiment\n   textblob_polarity += [textblob_sent.polarity]\n   textblob_subjectivity += [textblob_sent.subjectivity]\nWe’ll then pop each of these lists into a pandas DataFrame as a separate column:\nimport pandas as pd\n\nsent_scores = pd.DataFrame({\n   \"vader_neg\": vader_neg,\n   \"vader_neu\": vader_neu,\n   \"vader_pos\": vader_pos,\n   \"vader_compound\": vader_compound,\n   \"textblob_polarity\": textblob_polarity,\n   \"textblob_subjectivity\": textblob_subjectivity\n})\nNow, we’re ready to start exploring our results.\nTypically, this would be the point where we’d start creating a bunch of code for exploratory data analysis. This might be done using pandas’ describe method to get summary statistics over our columns, and writing Matplotlib or seaborn code to visualize our results. However, PyCharm has some features to speed this whole thing up.\nLet’s go ahead and print our DataFrame.\nsent_scores\nWe can see a button in the top right-hand corner, called Show Column Statistics. Clicking this gives us two different options: Compact and Detailed. Let’s select Detailed.\n\n\n\n\nNow we have summary statistics provided as part of our column headers! Looking at these, we can see the VADER compound score has a mean of 0.4 (median = 0.6), while the TextBlob polarity score provides a mean of 0.2 (median = 0.2).\nThis result indicates that, on average, VADER tends to estimate the same set of reviews more positively than TextBlob does. It also shows that for both sentiment analyzers, we likely have more positive reviews than negative ones – we can dive into this in more detail by checking some visualizations.\n\n\n\n\nAnother PyCharm feature we can use is the DataFrame Chart View. The button for this function is in the top left-hand corner.\n\nWhen we click on the button, we switch over to the chart editor. From here, we can create no-code visualizations straight from our DataFrame.\nLet’s start with VADER’s compound score. To start creating this chart, go to Show Series Settings in the top right-hand corner.\n\nRemove the default values for X Axis and Y Axis. Replace the X Axis value with vader_compound, and the Y Axis value with vader_compound. Click on the arrow next to the variable name in the Y Axis field, and select count.\nFinally, select Histogram from the chart icons, just under Series Settings. We likely have a bimodal distribution for the VADER compound score, with a slight peak around –0.8 and a much larger one around 0.9. This peak likely represents the split of negative and positive reviews. There are also far more positive reviews than negative.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s repeat the same exercise and create a histogram to see the distribution of the TextBlob polarity scores.\nIn contrast, TextBlob tends to rate most reviews as neutral, with very few reviews being strongly positive or negative. To understand why we have a discrepancy in the scores these two sentiment analyzers provide, let’s look at a review VADER rated as strongly positive and another that VADER rated strongly negative but that TextBlob rated as neutral.\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll get the index of the first review where VADER rated them as positive but TextBlob rated them as neutral:\nsent_scores[(sent_scores[\"vader_compound\"] >= 0.8) & (sent_scores[\"textblob_polarity\"].between(-0.1, 0.1))].index[0]\n42\nNext, we get the index of the first review where VADER rated them as negative but TextBlob as neutral:\nsent_scores[(sent_scores[\"vader_compound\"] <= -0.8) & (sent_scores[\"textblob_polarity\"].between(-0.1, 0.1))].index[0]\n0\n\n\n\nLet’s first retrieve the positive review:\nsample_reviews[42]\n\"I love carpet sweepers for a fast clean up and a way to conserve energy. The Ewbank Multi-Sweep is a solid, well built appliance. However, if you have pets, you will find that it takes more time cleaning the sweeper than it does to actually sweep the room. The Ewbank does pick up pet hair most effectively but emptying it is a bit awkward. You need to take a rag to clean out both dirt trays and then you need a small tooth comb to pull the hair out of the brushes and the wheels. To do a proper cleaning takes quite a bit of time. My old Bissell is easier to clean when it comes to pet hair and it does a great job. If you do not have pets, I would recommend this product because it is definitely well made and for small cleanups, it would suffice. For those who complain about appliances being made of plastic, unfortunately, these days, that's the norm. It's not great and plastic definitely does not hold up but, sadly, product quality is no longer a priority in business.\"\nThis review seems mixed, but is overall somewhat positive.\nNow, let’s look at the negative review:\nsample_reviews[0]\n'The only redeeming feature of this Cuisinart 4-cup coffee maker is the sleek black and silver design. After that, it rapidly goes downhill. It is frustratingly difficult to pour water from the carafe into the chamber unless it\\'s done extremely slow and with accurate positioning. Even then, water still tends to dribble out and create a mess. The lid, itself, is VERY poorly designed with it\\'s molded, round \"grip\" to supposedly remove the lid from the carafe. The only way I can remove it is to insert a sharp pointed object into one of the front pouring holes and pry it off! I\\'ve also occasionally had a problem with the water not filtering down through the grounds, creating a coffee ground lake in the upper chamber and a mess below. I think the designer should go back to the drawing-board for this one.'\nThis review is unambiguously negative. From comparing the two, VADER appears more accurate, but it does tend to overly prioritize positive terms in a piece of text.\nThe final thing we can consider is how subjective versus objective each review is. We’ll do this by creating a histogram of TextBlob’s subjectivity score.\n\n\n\n\nInterestingly, there is a good distribution of subjectivity in the reviews, with most reviews being a mixture of subjective and objective writing. A small number of reviews are also very subjective (close to 1) or very objective (close to 0).\nThese scores between them give us a nice way of cutting up the data. If you need to know the objective things that people did and did not like about the products, you could look at the reviews with a low subjectivity score and VADER compound scores close to 1 and –1, respectively.\nIn contrast, if you want to know what people’s emotional reaction to the products are, you could take those with a high subjectivity score and high and low VADER compound scores.\nThings to consider\nAs with any problem in natural language processing, there are a number of things to watch out for when doing sentiment analysis.\nOne of the biggest considerations is the language of the texts you’re trying to analyze. Many of the lexicon-based methods only work for a limited number of languages, so if you’re working with languages not supported by these lexicons, you may need to take another approach, such as using a fine-tuned LLM or training your own model(s).\nAs texts increase in complexity, it can also be difficult for lexicon-based analyzers and bag-of-words-based models to correctly detect sentiment. Sarcasm or more subtle context indicators can be hard for simpler models to detect, and these models may not be able to accurately classify the sentiment of such texts. LLMs may be able to handle more complex texts, but you would need to experiment with different models.\nFinally, when doing sentiment analysis, the same issues also come up as when dealing with any machine learning problem. Your models will only be as good as the training data you use. If you cannot get high-quality training and testing datasets suitable to your problem domain, you will not be able to correctly predict the sentiment of your target audience.\nYou should also make sure that your targets are appropriate for your business problem. It might seem attractive to build a model to know whether your products make your customers “sad”, “angry”, or “disgusted”, but if this doesn’t help you make a decision about how to improve your products, then it isn’t solving your problem.\nWrapping up\nIn this blog post, we dove deeply into the fascinating area of Python sentiment analysis and showed how this complex field is made more approachable by a range of powerful packages.\nWe covered the potential applications of sentiment analysis, different ways of assessing sentiment, and the main methods of extracting sentiment from a piece of text. We also saw some helpful features in PyCharm that make working with models and interpreting their results simpler and faster.\nWhile the field of natural language processing is currently focused intently on large language models, the older techniques of using lexicon-based analyzers or traditional machine learning models, like Naive Bayes classifiers, still have their place in sentiment analysis. These techniques shine when analyzing simpler texts, or when speed, predictions, or ease of deployment are priorities. LLMs are best suited to more complex or nuanced texts.\nNow that you’ve grasped the basics, you can learn how to do sentiment analysis with LLMs in our tutorial. The step-by-step guide helps you discover how to select the right model for your task, use it for sentiment analysis, and even fine-tune it yourself.\nIf you’d like to continue learning about natural language processing or machine learning more broadly after finishing this blog post, here are some resources:\nLearn how to do sentiment analysis with large language models\nStart studying machine learning with PyCharm\nExplore machine learning methods in software engineering\nGet started with sentiment analysis in PyCharm today\nIf you’re now ready to get started on your own sentiment analysis project, you can activate your free three-month subscription to PyCharm.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Airbnb had a large presence at the 2024 KDD conference hosted in Barcelona, Spain. Our Data Scientist and Engineers presented on topics like Deep Learning & Search Ranking, Online Experimentation & Measurement, Product Quality & Customer Journey, and Two-sided Marketplaces. This blog post summarizes our contributions to KDD for 2024 and provides access to the academic papers presented during the conference.\n\nAuthors: Huiji Gao, Peter Coles, Carolina Barcenas, Sanjeev Katariya\nKDD (Knowledge and Data Mining) is one of the most prestigious global conferences in data mining and machine learning. Hosted annually by a special interest group of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), it’s where attendees learn about some of the most ground-breaking AI developments in data mining, machine learning, knowledge discovery, and large-scale data analytics.\nThis year, the 30th KDD conference was held at Barcelona, Spain, attracting thousands of researchers and scientists from academia and industry. Various companies contributed to and attended the conference including Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Airbnb, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Booking, Expedia, ByteDance etc. There were 151 Applied Data Science (ADS) track papers and 411 Research track papers accepted, 34 tutorials, and 30 workshops.\nAirbnb had a significant presence at KDD 2024 with three full ADS track papers (acceptance rate under 20%), one workshop, and seven workshop papers and invited talks accepted into the main conference proceedings. The topics of our work spanned Deep learning & Search Ranking, Online Experimentation & Measurement, Causal Inference & Machine Learning, and Two-sided Marketplaces.\nIn this blog post, we will summarize our teams’ contributions and share highlights from an exciting week-long conference with research and industry talks, workshops, panel discussions, and more.\nDeep Learning and Search Ranking\nIntelligent search ranking — the process of accurately matching a guest with a listing based on their preference, a listing’s features, and additional search context — still remains a nuanced challenge that researchers are constantly trying to solve.\nMaking optimal guest-host matches has remained an issue in a two-sided marketplace for a variety of reasons — the timespan of guest searches (ranging between days and weeks), unpredictable host behavior and ratings (the potential for hosts to cancel a booking or receive low ratings), and limited understanding of guest preference across multiple interfaces. We published several papers addressing the issue of search ranking as part of our presence at KDD.\nLearning to Rank for Maps at Airbnb\nAirbnb brings together hosts who rent listings to prospective guests from around the globe. Results from a guest’s search for listings are displayed primarily through two interfaces: (1) as a list of rectangular cards that contain on them the listing image, price, rating, and other details, referred to as list-results, and (2) as oval pins on a map showing the listing price, called map-results. Both these interfaces, since their inception, have used the same ranking algorithm that orders listings by their booking probabilities and selects the top listings for display.\nHowever, some of the basic assumptions underlying ranking are built for a world where search results are presented as lists and simply break down for map-results. In this work, we rebuilt ranking for maps by revising the mathematical foundations of how users interact with map search results. Our iterative and experiment-driven approach led us through a path full of twists and turns, ending in a unified theory for the two interfaces.\nOur journey shows how assumptions taken for granted when designing machine learning algorithms may not apply equally across all user interfaces, and how they can be adapted. The net impact was one of the largest improvements in user experience for Airbnb which we discuss as a series of experimental validations. The work introduced in this paper is merely the beginning of future exciting research projects, such as making learning to rank unbiased for map-results and demarcating the map pins to direct the user attention towards more relevant ones.\nMulti-objective Learning to Rank by Model Distillation\nIn online marketplaces, the objective of search ranking is not only on optimizing purchasing or conversion rate (primary objective), but also the purchase outcomes (secondary objectives), e.g. order cancellation, review rating, customer service inquiries, platform long term growth. To balance these primary and secondary objectives, several multi-objective learning to rank approaches have been widely studied\nTraditional approaches in industrial search and recommender systems encounter challenges such as expensive parameter tuning that leads to sub-optimal solutions, suffering from imbalanced data sparsity issues, and lack of compatibility with ad-hoc objectives. In this work, we propose a distillation-based ranking solution for multi-objective ranking, which optimizes the end-to-end ranking system at Airbnb across multiple ranking models on different objectives, along with various considerations to optimize training and serving efficiency that meets industry standards.\nCompared with traditional approaches, the proposed solution not only significantly meets and increases the primary objective of conversion by a large margin, but also addresses the secondary objective constraints while improving model stability. Furthermore, we demonstrated the proposed system could be further simplified by model self-distillation. We also did additional simulations to show that this approach could help us efficiently inject ad-hoc non-differentiable business objectives into the ranking system, while enabling us to balance our optimization objectives.\nOnline Experimentation and Measurement\nOnline experimentation (e.g., A/B testing) is a common way for organizations like Airbnb to make data-driven decisions. But high variance is frequently a challenge. For example, it’s hard to prove that a change in our search UX will drive value because bookings can be infrequent and depend on a large number of interactions over a long period of time.\nMetric Decomposition in A/B Tests\nMore than a decade ago, CUPED (Controlled Experiments Utilizing Pre-Experiment Data) mainstreamed the idea of variance reduction leveraging pre-experiment covariates. Since its introduction, it has been implemented, extended, and modernized by major online experimentation platforms. Despite the wide adoption, it is known by practitioners that the variance reduction rate from CUPED, utilizing pre-experimental data, varies case by case and has a theoretical limit. In theory, CUPED can be extended to augment a treatment effect estimator utilizing in-experiment data, but practical guidance on how to construct such an augmentation is lacking.\nIn this work, we fill this gap by proposing a new direction for sensitivity improvement via treatment effect augmentation, whereby a target metric of interest is decomposed into\ntwo or more components in an attempt to isolate those with high signal and low noise from those with low signal and high noise. We show through theory, simulation, and empirical examples that if such a decomposition exists (or can be engineered), sensitivity may be increased via approximately null augmentation (in a frequentist setting) and reduced posterior variance (in a Bayesian setting).\nWe provide three real world applications demonstrating different flavors of metric decomposition. These applications illustrate the gain in agility metric decomposition yields relative to an un-decomposed analysis, indicating both empirically and theoretically the value of this practice in both frequentist and Bayesian settings. An important extension to this work would be to next consider sample size determination in both the frequentist or Bayesian contexts; while a boost in sensitivity typically means less data is required for a given analysis, a methodology that determines the smallest sample size required to control various operating characteristics in this context would be of practical value.\nTwo-sided Marketplace Optimization\nAirbnb employees hosted a workshop on Two-sided Marketplace Optimization: Search, Pricing, Matching & Growth. This workshop brought practitioners of two-sided marketplaces together and discussed the evolution of content ranking, recommendation systems, and data mining when solving for producers and consumers on these platforms.\nTwo-sided marketplaces have recently emerged as viable business models for many real-world applications. They model transactions as a network with two distinct types of participants: one type to represent the supply and another the demand of a specific good. Traditionally, research related to online marketplaces focused on how to better satisfy demand. But with two-sided marketplaces, there is more nuance at play. Modern global examples, like Airbnb, operate platforms where users provide services; users may be hosts,or guests. Such platforms must develop models that address all their users’ needs and goals at scale. Machine learning-powered methods and algorithms are essential in every aspect of such complex, internet-scale-sized, two-sided marketplaces.\nAirbnb is a community based on connection and belonging–we strive to connect people and places. Our contributions to this workshop showcase the work we’re doing to support this mission by optimizing guest experiences, finding equilibrium spots for listing prices, reducing the incidence of poor interactions (and customer support costs as a side effect), detecting when operational staff should follow up on activity at scale, and more.\nGuest Intention Modeling for Personalization\nAirbnb has transformed the way people travel by offering unique and personalized stays in destinations worldwide. To provide a seamless and tailored experience, understanding user intent plays an important role.\nHowever, limited user data and unpredictable guest behavior can make it difficult to understand the essential intent from guests on listings from hosts. Our work shows how we approach this challenging problem. We describe how we apply a deep learning approach to predict difficult-to-infer details for a user’s travel plan, such as the next destination and travel dates. The framework analyzes high-level information from users’ in-app browsing history, booking history, search queries, and other engagement signals, and produces multiple user intent signals.\n\nMarketing emails, flexible travel search (e.g., for “Europe in the summer”), and recommendations on the app home page are three guest interactions that benefit from correct intention modeling. Hosts also benefit, since a clear understanding of guest demand can help them optimize listings to increase satisfaction and bookings.\nGuest Demand Understanding\nHosts can find it difficult to correctly price their listings in two-sided marketplaces serviced by end users. Most hosts are not professional hospitality workers, and would benefit from access to data and advice on how guests see their listings and how they compare to other listings in their neighborhood. We constantly look for ways to give guidance on how hosts can optimally price their listings. The same information can then be used to help guests find their ideal stay.\nIn our paper, we presented an example of how this problem can be solved in general.\n\nAs illustrated above, both demand and supply change over time, influencing the equilibrium price for a property at a specific point. A historical optimum (such as A above) has to be adjusted to find the current optimum (point C). It is difficult to run experiments since any large-scale experiment we might run will cause the environment to change in complex ways. We tackle this problem by combining economic modeling with causal inference techniques. We segment guests and estimate how price-sensitive each guest segment is, and fine-tune them with empirical data from small targeted experiments and larger-scale natural ones, which are used to adjust estimates for the price sensitivity of each guest segment. Hosts can then use the models’ output to make informed tradeoffs between higher occupancy and higher nightly rates.\nListing Embedding for Host-side Products\nIn order to facilitate the matching of listings and guests, Airbnb provides numerous products and services to both hosts and guests. Many of these tools are based on the ability to compare listings, i.e. finding similar listings or listings that may be viewed as equivalent substitutes. Our work presents a study on the application and learning of listing embeddings in Airbnb’s two-sided marketplace. Specifically, we discuss the architecture and training of a neural network embedding model using guest side engagement data, which is then applied to host-side product surfaces. We address the key technical challenges we encountered, including the formulation of negative training examples, correction of training data sampling bias, and the scaling and speeding up training with the help of in-model caching. Additionally, we discuss our comprehensive approach to evaluation, which ranges from in-batch metrics and vocabulary-based evaluation to the properties of similar listings. Finally, we share our insights from utilizing listing embeddings in Airbnb products, such as host calendar similar listings.\nCustomer Support Optimization in Search Ranking\nAs of the date of the paper, Airbnb had more than 7.7 million listings from more than 5 million hosts worldwide. Airbnb is investing both in rapid growth and in making sure that the booking experience is pleasant for hosts and guests. It would, however, be ideal to avoid poor experiences in the first place. Our work highlights how we prevent poor experiences without significantly reducing growth.\nWe use the mass of accumulated support data at Airbnb to model the probability that, if the current user were to book a listing, they would require CS support. Our model discovered multiple features about the searcher, home, and hosts that accurately predict CS requirements. For example, same-day bookings tend to require more support, and a responsive host tends to reduce support needs. So, if a guest chooses a same-day booking, matching them with a highly responsive host can lead to a better experience overall. We incorporate the output of our CS support model in search result rankings; booked homes will sometimes rank lower if we predict a booking will lead to a negative experience.\nLLM Pretraining using Activity Logs\nIt’s often important to follow up with users after they’ve had a long series of interactions with a two-sided marketplace to help make sure that their experiences are of high quality. When user interactions meet certain business criteria, operations agents create tickets to follow up with them. For example, user retention and reactivation agents might review user activity logs and decide to follow up with the user, to encourage them to re-engage with the platform.\nWe propose transforming structured data (activity logs) into a more manageable text format and then leveraging modern language models (i.e., BERT) to pretrain a large language model based on user activities. We then performed fine-tuning on the model using historical data about which users were followed up with and checked its predictions. Our work demonstrates the large language model trained on pre-processed activity can successfully identify when a user should be followed up with, at an experimentally significant rate. Our preliminary results suggest that our framework may outperform by 80% the average precision of a similar model that was designed relying heavily on feature engineering.\nProduct Quality and Customer Journey Optimization\nTypically, product quality is evaluated based on structured data. Customer ratings, types of support issues, resolution times, and other factors are used as a proxy for how someone booking on Airbnb might value a listing. This kind of data has limitations — more popular listings have more data, often users don’t leave feedback, and feedback is usually biased towards the positive (users with negative experiences tend to churn and not give feedback).\nIn the Workshop on Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice, we highlighted an example of how we push the boundaries of product quality assessment techniques and applications, mixing traditional casual inference with cutting-edge machine learning research. In our work “Understanding Product Quality with Unstructured Data: An Application of LLMs and Embeddings at Airbnb”, we presented how an approach based on text embeddings and LLMs can be combined with approaches based on structured data to significantly improve product quality evaluations. We generate text embeddings on a mix of listing and review texts, then cluster the embeddings based on rebooking and churn rates. Once we have clear clusters, we extract keywords from the original data, and use these keywords to calculate a listing quality score, based on their similarity to the keyword list.\nIn addition, we were invited to give a talk on Quality Foundations at Airbnb, at KDD’s 3rd Workshop on End-End Customer Journey Optimization. It’s often hard to differentiate the quality of customer experiences using simple review ratings, in part due to the tightness of their distribution. In this talk, we present an alternative notion of quality based on customer revealed preference: did a customer return to use the platform again after their experience? We describe how a metric — Guest Return Propensity (GRP) — leverages this concept and can differentiate quality, capture platform externalities, and predict future returns.\nIn practice, this measure may not be suited to many common business use cases due to its lagging nature and an inability to easily explain why it has changed. We describe a quality measurement system that builds on the conceptual foundation of GRP by modeling it as an outcome of upstream realized quality signals. These signals — from sources like reviews and customer support — are weighted by their impact on return propensity and mapped to a quality taxonomy to aid in explainability. The resulting score is capable of finely differentiating the quality of customer experiences, aiding tradeoff decisions, and providing timely insights.\nConclusion\nThe 2024 edition of KDD was an amazing opportunity for data scientists and machine learning engineers from across the globe and industry, government, and academia, to connect and exchange learnings and discoveries. We were honored to have the opportunity to share some of our knowledge and techniques, generalizing what we have been learning when we apply machine learning to problems we see at Airbnb. We continue to focus on improving our customers’ experience and growing our business, and the information we’ve shared has been crucial to our success. We’re excited to continue learning from peers and contribute our work back to our community. We eagerly await advancements and improvements that might come about as others build upon the work we’ve shared.\nBelow, you’ll find a complete list of the talks and papers shared in this article along with the team members who contributed.

Many developers have found this process confusing and worry whether their changes are being properly staged in Git. But worry no more – there’s a solution!\n\nWhen you rename files in Solution Explorer, Visual Studio 2022 will now remind you to stage your changes to see the renamed files in Git. This small but mighty notification ensures that Git is recognizing your file change.\nWhy This Matters\nThere is often confusion on how Git works when you rename files, especially since there’s a specific git mv command that is used when you want to move or rename a file or directory. But don’t be deceived, Git never stores any information to track renames. Even when you run a git mv operation, it’s just a short cut for doing a git rm, and then git add on the file. That’s because Git only looks at code change additions (git add) and removals (git rm) over time. In some views Git runs rename detection as it’s navigating history and may display a set of an addition and removal as a rename, but under the hood it uses a heuristic based on the similarity of the two files to call it a rename instead – and sometimes it gets it wrong!\nThis shows up in Visual Studio when you rename a file from Solution Explorer and look at your changed files list. In all cases, it is shown as an addition and a removal. Understandably, this can be disconcerting if you’re expecting Git to detect and track the rename and fear you might be losing history information. However, since Git is not tracking renames at all, you won’t be at risk! Your file changes are still in the Git history and can be retrieved. To gain some additional piece of mind, once you stage your files, Git runs the rename detection, and you can see how it resolves the addition and removal into a rename under the staged section. That’s where this new notification comes in.\nTip: If you want to ensure that Git can always identify your file renames when navigating history, you can keep your file naming changes in a separate commit to file content changes. That way, there’s a perfect match between the file that Git sees as removed and the one that Git sees as added, so it’ll correctly detect the rename. This isn’t required and can be inconvenient if it doesn’t match up to your flow but can be helpful when looking through your history later.\nUser Feedback Driven Updates\nThis feature was developed in response to feedback from the Developer Community. We listened to your concerns and collaborated with you to create a solution that makes your workflow more efficient and stress-free. Your input is invaluable, and we are committed to continuously improving Visual Studio based on your feedback.\nWe want to extend our heartfelt thanks to our users.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Nautilus is our search engine for finding documents and other files in Dropbox. Introduced in 2018, Nautilus uses a conventional keyword-based approach that, while functional, has some inherent shortcomings. Because Nautilus has limited contextual understanding of what someone may be looking for, users are required to precisely recall a file’s exact name or the specific keywords within. For instance, a search for “employment contract” may overlook relevant “job agreement” or “offer letter” documents, as Nautilus did not grab their contextual similarity. And for multilingual users, Nautilus expects queries and documents to be in the same language, hindering efficient retrieval when dealing with content in different languages.\nTo mitigate these limitations, we considered techniques such as stemming, spelling correction, and query expansion for improved flexibility. However, we wondered if we could elevate the Dropbox search experience further. Could it be possible to help users find their content without needing to know the exact search term?\nEnter semantic search. Rather than rely on exact keyword matches, semantic search aims to better understand the relationship between user queries and document content. This functionality ultimately enables Dropbox users to locate crucial information more quickly, so they can spend less time searching and more time focusing on the task at hand.\nFor multilingual users, semantic search also unlocks another capability: cross-lingual search. This advanced feature allows users to search in one language and receive relevant results in other languages, further enhancing accessibility and usability.\nWe’re excited to share that Dropbox now supports semantic search (powered by Nautilus), adding the aforementioned capabilities. We rolled it out for Dropbox users internally in early 2024 and then externally as an experiment for a subset of Pro and Essential users in May 2024. And with this release, we observed a nearly 17% reduction in empty search sessions (measured by ZRR, or zero-results rate), and a 2% lift in search session success (measured by qCTR, or qualified click-through rate). Based on these positive results, we decided to make semantic search generally available to all Pro and Essential users in August 2024, and coming soon in early 2025 for Business users.\nStaying true to our AI Principles, we performed the evaluation of different embedding models in-house with pre-trained models, and we did not train on any user data. Below, we’ll introduce the key concepts behind semantic search, and walk you through our approach for selecting one essential component: the text embedding model.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Understanding semantic search: A new paradigm\n\r\n\r\n\n\nSemantic search is designed to retrieve information based on meaning and intent, going beyond the limitations of simple keyword matching. While the terms \"semantic search\" and \"vector search\" are sometimes used interchangeably, within the context of this post we define \"semantic search\" as the entire flow—from user query input to search results output—and \"vector search\" as the specific step of retrieving items based on vector similarity. We plan to introduce the concept of semantic search for multiple file types, but in this first iteration of semantic search at Dropbox, we focused on supporting only text files.\nAt its core, semantic search relies on vector search as the underlying technology to interpret and process unstructured data such as text, images, audio, and video. This process involves transforming content into numeric representations called embeddings, which capture the rich features of the data in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings, or vectors, are dense lists of numbers encoding features across hundreds or thousands of dimensions. During training, machine learning models refine these dimensions to capture nuanced patterns—whether visual details, document structure, or associations among words. While individual dimensions are often abstract, certain aspects may implicitly capture features like sentiment, syntax, or relationships between concepts. This dense representation enables a context-aware understanding that drives more meaningful retrieval.\nVector search provides the flexibility to store different types of embeddings, for different file types, based on the specific needs of the application. By selecting or training models that capture the most relevant features for the task at hand—such as visual characteristics for images or semantic relationships for text—we can tailor the embeddings to support a wide range of content types and use cases.\nBuilding on this foundation, semantic search operates by transforming user queries into embeddings and then performing vector search to retrieve results that align with the query's intent, rather than its literal terms. The search begins when a user enters a query, which is converted into an embedding and compared against stored embeddings using vector search. Related items naturally cluster together in the vector space, even when the formats differ—whether text, images, or diagrams. Using nearest-neighbor algorithms, vector search identifies results based on meaning, ensuring that the retrieved content aligns with the user's intent. For example, a search for “guides and resources” could surface instructional PDFs, training videos, and visual diagrams—regardless of the exact labels for each item.\nThis similarity-based retrieval approach unlocks a wide range of possibilities, from linking related documents and multimedia to uncovering insights across diverse content. Vector search enhances our interaction with information by establishing meaningful connections between items, supporting a flexible and integrated search experience. Through its ability to understand meaning and context, vector search provides the technical foundation for a search system that can adapt to varied applications, delivering more relevant and context-aware results.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Identifying the right model for our purposes\n\r\n\r\n\n\nCentral to semantic search—and for our use case, for text documents—is the document embedding model, which maps each document and query to the respective embeddings. Implementing semantic search at Dropbox scale would require mapping both new and existing documents to their embeddings and storing them in our indices. For a search platform as large as Dropbox, indexing more than a trillion documents and exabytes of data, could get very expensive computationally! Overall performance—in terms of both latency and quality—would hinge on the model we used.\nSince computing the embedding for a user’s search query would now be in the critical path for retrieving their documents, speed would be paramount. Also, a faster model would mean we could index our users’ documents faster, leading to time and cost savings down the line.\nAt the same time, the quality of our embeddings needed to be high enough to benefit from the vector search paradigm. Whatever document embedding model we chose would need to generate embeddings that were similar enough to match documents with their relevant queries, but still discriminative enough to filter out irrelevant documents.\nWe decided to perform a thorough evaluation of available models to find the one most suitable for our purposes, measuring each model with speed and search quality in mind. \n\r\n\r\n    \n Integrating the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFortunately, assessing document embedding models is an undertaking that has already been embraced by the research community. The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) is an open-source benchmark that assesses document embedding models across eight evaluation tasks and 56 datasets, some of them multilingual. MTEB has published over 2,000 results to its leaderboard since its release in 2022. \nWe adapted the MTEB benchmark and leveraged the reranking task to fit our needs as follows:\nCustomizations for Dropbox infrastructure. We added adapters to enable the evaluation of models running in our in-house inference services, in addition to models executed inline. We also added adapters to allow streaming datasets that reside in our infrastructure.\nMultiple embeddings per document. MTEB by default presumes that a single embedding is generated per document, as the size of documents in the public datasets are fairly consistent. However, in production, our user’s document can range from very tiny to very large, leading to the hypothesis that we should try generating multiple embeddings per document. We implemented various nuanced strategies for separating, or chunking, a given document into individual chunks. Chunking is further configurable with a parameter for specifying overlap between consecutive chunks. We also explored summarization, in order to ensure that we respect the model’s internal threshold on input size. The resulting embeddings can then be used directly or in aggregate.\nOptimizations for storage and precision. To optimize storage costs, we reduced the precision (full 32-bit floating point, half float, quarter float, fixed point of various bit depth) and dimensionality (via Gaussian random projections) of MTEB's full-sized embeddings.\nFiles versus documents. Whereas the public datasets in MTEB consist of unnamed documents identified by their content, documents in Dropbox are named by our users—and filenames are quite significant in retrieval tasks. We crafted various approaches to incorporate embeddings of the filenames into MTEB when applicable.\n\r\n\r\n    \n Constructing novel datasets for evaluation\n\r\n\r\n\n\nAmong the evaluation tasks that MTEB offers, we were most interested in re-ranking and retrieval tasks. While the performance of various models across the two tasks were readily available on the leaderboard, these two tasks primarily offered English-only datasets, which does not match the distribution of the Dropbox corpus. To address any potential distribution shift between the public datasets and the Dropbox corpus, we leveraged our existing ML-powered search platform Nautilus to construct our own MTEB-compatible datasets for more precise evaluation.\nWe created a Kubeflow pipeline to generate a custom dataset purely for the purpose of evaluating the different embeddings models and configurations. With this pipeline, we extract anonymized query-document pairs from Dropbox search logs and put them in an MTEB-compatible format within our in-house service for hosting L0 datasets. We have strict security and access controls in place to ensure that only Dropboxers who need access to this data can access it. Moreover, as per our data retention policies, the datasets get deleted after 30 days.\nWe also extended the pipeline to unlock multilingual evaluation. At the time of our benchmarking, the public retrieval datasets were English-only (nowadays, MIRACL dataset bridges this gap). In order to diversify our evaluation criteria beyond English, we pioneered a set of multilingual datasets (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean) from Dropbox search logs.\n\r\n\r\n    \nEvaluation and model selection\n\r\n\r\n\n\nFrom an exhaustive evaluation of 11 models—including four multilingual ones—we selected multilingual-e5-large as the top performer. This model not only excelled on our Dropbox datasets, but at the time of benchmarking also stood out as the best multilingual model on the MTEB public leaderboard across various tasks.\nBelow are our benchmark results on our custom datasets for multilingual models, using a configuration of two embeddings per document: one for title with path, and another for the first chunk of the text content. Metrics reported are mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and mean average precision (MAP), where higher is better.\n\r\n\r\n\n    \n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n    \n\r\n          \n\n\nModel\nEnglish\nJapanese\nSpanish\nKorean\nGerman\n\nparaphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2\nMRR: 0.3299\nMRR: 0.2245\nMAP: 0.2448\nMRR: 0.2367\nMAP: 0.2568\nMRR: 0.2338\nMAP: 0.2546\nMRR: 0.2879\nMAP: 0.3078\nparaphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2\n\nMRR: 0.3108\nMAP: 0.3278\nMRR: 0.2628\nMAP: 0.2804\nMRR: 0.2043\nMAP: 0.2273\nMRR: 0.2374\nMAP: 0.2584\nMRR: 0.2355\nMAP: 0.2533\nmultilingual-e5-large \n\nMRR: 0.5044\nMAP: 0.5133\nMRR: 0.4265\nMAP: 0.4386\nMRR: 0.3350\nMAP: 0.3524\nMRR: 0.4003\nMAP: 0.4118\nMRR: 0.3305\n\"map\": 0.3432\nmultilingual-e5-base\n\nMRR: 0.4492\nMAP: 0.4603\nMRR: 0.3659\nMAP: 0.3795\nMRR: 0.3330\nMAP: 0.3511\nMRR: 0.3817\nMAP: 0.3957\nMRR: 0.3405\nMAP: 0.3535\n\n\n\r\n    \n\r\n  \n\r\n\nWhile our evaluation primarily focused on re-ranking and retrieval tasks, we knew that other teams at Dropbox might be interested in using MTEB to evaluate additional tasks. To extend its functionality beyond vector search, we linked MTEB with the rest of our infrastructure and added additional key parameters for evaluation. This means that other Dropbox initiatives—such as Dropbox Dash, or our AI-powered file summaries and conversational features—can now leverage MTEB to evaluate various document embedding models for their applications as well.\n\r\n\r\n    \nPutting the model into production\n\r\n\r\n\n\nIn order to make the best use of our storage and compute resources, putting multilingual-e5-large into production required some tradeoffs. \nBased on available storage capacity, we started by setting an upper bound of 4KB of vector-search-related metadata per document. This gave us room to adjust the number of embeddings per document, as well as the dimensionality of those embeddings and their numerical precision.\nIn compression experiments, reducing precision to 8-bit per channel resulted in a manageable 1KB per embedding with a marginal impact on quality. However, reducing dimensionality adversely affected quality. Given that two embeddings fit our storage constraints, we opted to maintain the full dimension of the embeddings to preserve data integrity.\nThe final quantization format we adopted is a slight variation over the standard 8-bit: we first scale the embedding so that the maximum over the magnitudes of individual channels is exactly 1.0. We store the scalar separately as a 32-bit float (4 bytes)—and the scaled embedding, which lies in [-1, 1], can be converted to 8-bit fixed point by remapping the range to 8-bit signed integer and rounding. We found that this scheme minimized the error on cosine similarity over the query-document pairs in our dataset.\nAs for managing our compute resources, we had to consider:\nThe maximum number of characters per document\nConstraints on the number of document chunks\nHow to balance chunk sizes to maintain contextual relevance without an overwhelming amount of processing\nDifferent document embedding strategies (file path and/or content embeddings)\nOur findings ultimately favored a dual approach: storing separate embeddings for the file path (including path and filename) and the document content up to some limit (512 tokens). While this method doesn't encompass the entire document, focusing on the initial 512 tokens significantly lowered costs and processing demands with just two embeddings per document.\n\r\n\r\n    \n A more relevant Dropbox search experience\n\r\n\r\n\n\nSearch engines have come a long way from simple keyword-based queries. With vector search, we can use machine learning to actually figure out the meaning behind queries and content. This makes it much easier for users to find the files or data they need quickly. It also doesn’t matter what language they use—whether in their queries or content—which is a big deal.\nGetting to this point took a lot of careful planning and decision-making. By using multilingual-e5-large with just two embeddings per document, we think we’ve struck the right balance between search quality, speed, and efficiency. But it's not just about being faster. The real value of vector search is in helping our users work more effectively, get more done, and find Dropbox easier to use. We’re also not done yet. We’re committed to giving ours users the best tools for modern work, and you can expect to hear more about our efforts to make search in Dropbox even better.\nAcknowledgements for this project (in alphabetical order): Aditya Jayaraman, Alex Yin, Daniel Cardenas, Jongmin Baek, Kedar Rudre, Marta Mendez, Matt Barta, Mingye Xia, Morgan Zerby, Muye Gao, Prasang Upadhyaya, Sarah Andrabi, Yidi Zhang, Zhangfan Dong.\n~ ~ ~\nIf building innovative products, experiences, and infrastructure excites you, come build the future with us!

(보통 첫 실행에서 이상한 경우가 종종 있으니까 되도록이면 1번은 재실행을 권장한다)\n이제 fcitx5-configtool에서 아래 그림처럼 왼쪽의 현재 입력기에 \"한글\"을 추가해두면 된다. 보통은 기본적으로 추가되어 있어서 건드릴 필요가 없을텐데, 만일 없다면 찾아서 추가해주어야 한다.(기본으로 영문 모드인 경우에는 \"한글\"대신 \"Hangul\"을 찾아서 추가해두면 된다) 참고로 '키보드-한국어'나 '키보드-한국어-한국어(101/104키 호환)' 같은 것들은 한국어 키보드 배열의 영문을 의미하는 것이니 한글이 아니므로 추가할 필요가 없다.\nfcitx5-configtool - input method\n\n\n두번째 탭인 '전역 옵션'에서 단축키의 '트리거 입력기'를 Control-Space에서 Shift-Space로 변경하면 ibus와 똑같이 사용할 수 있다. (기본값인 Control-Space를 그대로 쓰려면 아무것도 건들지 않으면 된다) 우측 ALT키를 한영전환으로 쓰고 싶다면, \"+\"를 눌러서 새로운 키를 하나 추가하고, 우측 ALT를 추가해두면 된다.\nfcitx5-configtool - global options\n\n\n재부팅을 했을때에도 fcitx5가 잘 실행되는지 테스트하기 위해 재부팅 해본다.\n \n참고\nCentOS의 ibus 설정 (CentOS, Rocky, Alma, Fedora 대부분이 같음) - CentOS7 리눅스 한글 입력기 설정 : ibus-hangul\n페도라 리눅스에서 nimf 한글 입력기 설정법 - 리눅스 한글 입력기 nimf : Fedora33,40,41\n \n히스토리\n2024-12-12 초안",

NHN Cloud NCUI개발팀 이진우입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n저는 올해 2월부터 매주 프론트엔드 관련 다양한 뉴스레터를 읽고, FE 개발 직무 동료들에게 흥미로운 뉴스, 읽을거리, 유용한 도구 등을 공유해 왔습니다.\r\r\n어느덧 연말이 가까워지며 쌓여 온 링크들은 상당한 양이 되었는데요. 이를 정리하며 개인적으로 인상 깊었던 주제와 도구를 공유드리고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n물론, 개인적인 관심사가 반영되어 있기도 하고, 조직 내에서 영향이 큰 프레임워크나 기술 스택 위주로 정리된 만큼 부족한 부분이 있을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n훑어보시면서 혹시 낯설거나 관심이 가는 주제가 있다면 함께 제공한 읽을거리 링크가 도움이 되기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n(정리된 내용 중 일부는 시간이 지나며 업데이트되거나 새로운 정보로 대체되었을 수 있습니다. )\r\r\n\r\r\n## 프론트엔드 기술 스택\r\r\n\r\r\n프론트엔드 개발은 마치 9G 중력 가속도처럼 빠르게 변하며 개발자들을 압박해 왔지만 최근엔 변화의 속도가 다소 안정된 듯한 느낌입니다. ☕️ 새로운 개념을 바탕으로 한 프레임워크와 도구가 끊임없이 쏟아졌던 과거와 달리, 이제는 더 나은 생산성과 사용자 경험을 위한 실용적인 도구들이 점차 정착되고 있습니다. 2024년에 출시되진 않았지만, 개인적으로 올해 활약상이 인상 깊었던 몇 가지 라이브러리를 소개하고자 합니다. ‍\r\r\n\r\r\n### shadcn/ui\r\r\n\r\r\n[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)는 TailwindCSS와 Headless UI의 철학을 결합한 라이브러리로, 복사-붙여넣기(copy-paste) 방식으로 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있는 점이 특징입니다. 개발자는 필요한 컴포넌트를 복사한 뒤, 프로젝트 요구에 맞게 간단히 수정하여 사용할 수 있어 효율성이 뛰어납니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [(번역) shadcn/ui의 해부](https://siosio3103.medium.com/shadcn-ui-%EC%9D%98-%ED%95%B4%EB%B6%80-ebd469c34614)\r\r\n* [How headless components became the future for building UI libraries](https://www.subframe.com/blog/how-headless-components-became-the-future-for-building-ui-libraries)\r\r\n* [Headless, boneless, skinless & lifeless UI](https://nerdy.dev/headless-boneless-and-skinless-ui)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Zod\r\r\n\r\r\n[Zod](https://zod.dev/)는 TypeScript와 완벽히 통합된 스키마 선언 및 데이터 검증 라이브러리로, 간결한 문법과 타입 추론을 통해 개발 생산성을 크게 높여 서버-클라이언트 간 데이터 구조를 명확하게 정의하고 유지할 수 있습니다. REST API, GraphQL, Form Data Validation 등 다양한 환경에서 활용 가능하며, 코드의 가독성을 유지하면서도 강력한 검증 로직을 구현할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [The process.env frontend time bomb](https://massimilianomirra.com/notes/the-frontend-process-env-time-bomb-plus-a-sustainable-definition-of-fixed)\r\r\n* [Making a REST API typesafe with Ready Query and Zod](https://noahflk.com/blog/typesafe-rest-api)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Vitest\r\r\n\r\r\n[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)는 Vite 기반의 테스트 러너로, 빠른 테스트 실행 속도와 간편한 설정으로 주목 받고 있습니다. 테스트 생태계의 하나의 표준과도 같았던 Jest와 유사한 API를 제공해 쉽게 전환이 가능하며, ESM과 TypeScript를 기본적으로 지원합니다. 특히 Vite와의 긴밀한 통합을 통해 개발 환경과 테스트 환경 간의 일관성을 유지할 수 있어 Vite 사용 시 더욱 효율적인 테스트 경험을 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Vitest vs. Jest](https://www.speakeasy.com/post/vitest-vs-jest)\r\r\n* [Storybook 8.3 - First class Vitest integration](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8-3/)\r\r\n* [JavaScript unit testing frameworks in 2024: A comparison](https://raygun.com/blog/javascript-unit-testing-frameworks/#vitest)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기타\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)은 ESLint, Prettier의 대체 도구로 빠른 속도를 자랑합니다. 하지만 파일 간의 의존성이나 프로젝트 전반의 정보를 필요로 하는 정적 분석엔 아직 개선이 필요한데, 최근 Biome의 개발자는 [다중 파일 분석의 접근 방법](https://arendjr.nl/blog/2024/11/biome_approach_to_multi_file_analysis/)을 공유했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 요즘 웹사이트만 들어가면 쿠키 동의 때문에 정신없으시죠? GDPR(general data protection regulation)을 준수하기 위함인데 이와 관련된 라이브러리들([cookieconsent](https://github.com/brainsum/cookieconsent), [cookie checker](https://complydog.com/free-cookie-checker-tool))이 눈에 띄었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Zod의 대안으로 Yup, AJV, Joi, Superstruct 등이 있지만 TypeScript와의 통합이 부족하거나, 기능이 부족하거나, 러닝 커브가 높기도 합니다. 하지만 최근 [Vailbot](https://valibot.dev/)이 v1 베타 기간을 갖고 있는데, 더 작은 번들 사이즈로도 Zod와 유사한 기능을 제공해 주목을 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/)은 Tanner Linsley가 운영하는 라이브러리 생태계로, 현재 9개 라이브러리를 운영하며 프론트엔드 개발에서 빠르게 주목 받고 있습니다. 특히 알파 단계인 TanStack Start 프레임워크는 Next.js의 잠재적 경쟁자로 화제가 되고 있으며, TanStack Router는 SSR을 강력히 지원하며 클라이언트 사이드의 인터랙션도 최적화합니다. 또한, 엔터프라이즈급 라우팅을 타입 안전하게 구현하며, 번들링 및 배포는 [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi)를 통해 처리해 높은 성능과 유연성을 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## React\r\r\n\r\r\n### React Deep Dive\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 FE 개발 조직은 React를 사용하고 있는데요. 사실 React로 기술 스택을 전환한 지는 React의 역사에 비해 그리 오래되지 않았습니다. 시간이 지남에 따라 React 사용에 익숙해지면서 내부 동작 원리에 대한 호기심이 생겼고, 조직 내 몇 명이 모여 React 내부 구조를 알아보는 스터디를 시작했습니다. ‍ 아래는 스터디 과정에서 참고했던 링크들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [React 톺아보기](https://goidle.github.io/react/in-depth-react-preview/)\r\r\n* [(번역) A deep dive into React Fiber internals](https://bumkeyy.gitbook.io/bumkeyy-code/frontend/a-deep-dive-into-react-fiber-internals)\r\r\n* ▶️ [React 파이버 아키텍처 분석](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/2690975)\r\r\n* ▶️ [Inside React (동시성을 구현하는 기술)](https://deview.kr/2021/sessions/518)\r\r\n\r\r\n### React 19\r\r\n\r\r\nReact팀은 v19 업데이트를 위해 많은 노력을 기울였습니다. 하지만 최초 v19 RC가 공개된 후 Suspense의 동작 변경으로 인해 여러 컴포넌트가 순차적으로 데이터를 가져오게 되는 워터폴 현상이 발생했습니다.  React 팀은 이 동작이 의도된 동작이 아님을 확인하고 수정하겠다고 밝혔습니다. 이 사건은 오픈 소스 커뮤니티에서 투명한 소통과 협력의 중요성을 다시 한번 환기시켰습니다. 현재 React v19는 `prewarming`이라는 기능을 통해 이슈를 해소하며, 다시 RC v1 단계를 거쳐 현재 [v19](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.0.0)를 릴리스했습니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n* [React 19 and suspense](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts)\r\r\n* [React core PR - sibiling pre-rendering feature](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29898#issuecomment-2477449973)\r\r\n* [What's new in react 19](https://vercel.com/blog/whats-new-in-react-19)\r\r\n* [Server Actions have been renamed to Server Functions](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)\r\r\n\r\r\n### React Compiler\r\r\n\r\r\nReact v19만큼이나 커뮤니티를 들썩이게 만든 또 다른 주제는 바로 React Compiler(코드명: Forget ‍️)입니다. React는 상태 변경과 리렌더링을 중심으로 동작하지만, 때로는 memoization을 통해 이러한 동작을 최적화해야 할 때가 있습니다. 그러나 이 과정에서 가독성이 떨어지고 오류가 발생하는 경우가 많았습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 React Compiler가 등장했죠. \r\r\n\r\r\nReact Compiler는 memoization 최적화를 자동으로 처리할 뿐만 아니라, 앞으로는 JSX Inlining과 JSX Outlining 같은 기능도 지원할 예정입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\\- JSX Inlining: 불필요한 JSX Runtime 호출을 제거하고 미리 빌드된 JSX 객체를 삽입\\.\r\r\n\\- JSX Outlining: 컴파일러가 하위 컴포넌트를 자동으로 추출하여 최적화\\.\r\r\n\r\r\n현재 [베타 릴리스](https://react.dev/blog/2024/10/21/react-compiler-beta-release) 단계이며, React v17 이상에서 사용할 수 있습니다. ✨\r\r\n\r\r\n* [(번역) 리액트 컴파일러 사용법](https://junghan92.medium.com/%EB%B2%88%EC%97%AD-%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%A1%ED%8A%B8-%EC%BB%B4%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC%EB%9F%AC-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EB%B2%95-%EC%99%84%EB%B2%BD-%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C-a6a0e96edc97)\r\r\n* [Understanding React Compiler](https://tonyalicea.dev/blog/understanding-react-compiler/)\r\r\n* [Alias analysis in the React Compiler](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/alias-analysis/)\r\r\n* [Compiler Theory and Reactivity](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/ssa/)\r\r\n* [Type system of the React Compiler](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/type-system/)\r\r\n* ▶️ [What's next for the react compiler?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5yk2gxbtg)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Next.js\r\r\n\r\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)는 React 기반의 풀스택 프레임워크로, 서버와 클라이언트 렌더링을 유연하게 결합해 강력한 개발 경험을 제공합니다. 특히 App Router와 React Server Components(RSC)의 도입으로 동적 라우팅과 성능 최적화가 크게 강화되었습니다.\r\r\n올해 Next.js는 [v14.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-2), v15 RC [v1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc), [v2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc2)를 거쳐 정식으로 [v15](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)를 릴리스했습니다. 여기에 모노레포(monorepo) 관리를 위한 Turborepo와 차세대 번들러인 Turbopack 또한 긴밀히 통합해 Next.js 생태계를 구축하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How vercel adopted microfrontends](https://vercel.com/blog/how-vercel-adopted-microfrontends)\r\r\n* [Turbopack Dev is now stable](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)\r\r\n* [How to set up next.js 15 for production in 2024](https://www.reactsquad.io/blog/how-to-set-up-next-js-15-for-production)\r\r\n* [Vercel functions -

Wiz는 Gmail, Search와 같은 성능이 중요한 서비스에서 사용되는 프레임워크로 이번 통합은 SSR 지원 강화를 목적으로 이루어졌습니다. 이어 5월에는 [v18](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-v18-is-now-available-e79d5ac0affe)을 발표하며 변경 감지 라이브러리 추출, 홈페이지 개편, 그리고 SSR 기능 강화를 진행했습니다. 11월에는 [v19](https://blog.angular.dev/meet-angular-v19-7b29dfd05b84)가 [릴리스](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/19.0.0)되며, 부족했던 렌더링 모드의 다양화, Hydration 제어 개선, 그리고 Signal 도입이라는 큰 변화를 선보였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Google Angular Lead sees convergence in JavaScript Framework](https://thenewstack.io/google-angular-lead-sees-convergence-in-javascript-frameworks/)\r\r\n* [Managing Angular](https://blog.mgechev.com/2024/08/25/managing-angular/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Svelte\r\r\n\r\r\nSvelte는 [v5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive) 릴리스를 통해 패러다임의 전환을 알렸습니다. 과거에는 `let count = 0`만 작성해도 Svelte의 컴파일러가 이를 상태로 처리했지만, 이제는 더 명시적으로 상태를 선언하는 방식으로 변화했습니다. 새로운 메커니즘인 [runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes)가 도입되었으며, `$state()`를 통해 반응형 상태를 명확히 관리할 수 있게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Astro\r\r\n\r\r\nAstro는 최근 [v5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/) 업데이트에서 타입 안전 환경 변수 설정을 지원하며 환경 변수의 가시성과 안전성을 강화했습니다. 또한 Content Layer API를 통해 다양한 데이터 소스에서 가져온 콘텐츠를 타입 안전하게 관리할 수 있게 되었으며, 렌더링 기능을 강화해 페이지와 컴포넌트별로 SSR과 정적 생성을 유연하게 선택할 수 있게 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Hono\r\r\n\r\r\n[Hono](https://hono.dev/)는 모든 JavaScript Runtime에서 실행 가능한 경량 웹 서버 프레임워크로, 빠른 라우팅을 지원하는 RegExpRouter 개념과 여러 헬퍼, 미들웨어로 주목 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Waku\r\r\n\r\r\n[Waku](https://waku.gg/)는 Zustand와 Jotai 진영에서 개발한 리액트 기반 풀스택 프레임워크로, React의 Server Action API를 지원하는 [v0.21](https://waku.gg/blog/server-actions-are-here)을 출시했습니다. 중규모 애플리케이션 개발을 목표로 하며, Next.js의 대안으로 기대를 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 다양한 렌더링 모드\r\r\n\r\r\n최근 프론트엔드 프레임워크들은 다양한 렌더링 방식을 제공하여 각자의 장점을 활용한 최적화 전략을 선보이고 있습니다.\r\r\nCSR(Client-Side Rendering)은 동적이고 빠른 사용자 경험(UX)을 제공하지만, 초기 HTML이 서버에서 제공되지 않기 때문에 SEO에는 다소 불리합니다.\r\r\n이에 반해, SSR(Server-Side Rendering)과 SSG(Static-Site Generation)은 초기 페이지 로드 시 완전한 HTML을 제공해 SEO와 성능 최적화에 유리합니다. Astro는 [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture)를 활용해 정적 콘텐츠와 인터랙티브 요소를 분리하고, Server Islands를 통해 필요한 동적 콘텐츠만 효율적으로 로드합니다. 또한, Next.js는 [PPR(Partial Pre-Rendering)](https://vercel.com/blog/partial-prerendering-with-next-js-creating-a-new-default-rendering-model)을 통해 동적 콘텐츠를 스트리밍 하며 점진적 렌더링 방식을 선도하고 있습니다.\r\r\n이런 다양한 렌더링 방식들은 앱의 목적과 성능 요구 사항에 따라 적절히 선택할 필요가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Client-Side Rendering](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering)\r\r\n* [What's a Single-Page App?](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/whats-a-single-page-app/)\r\r\n* [How to choose the best rendering strategy for your app](https://vercel.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-rendering-strategy-for-your-app)\r\r\n\r\r\n## JavaScript\r\r\n\r\r\n### Signals\r\r\n\r\r\nECMAScript 위원회인 TC39에 [Signal 도입 제안](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals)이 올라왔습니다. [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Solid](https://solidjs.com/)와 같은 프레임워크는 이미 Signal을 활용하여 Reactivity를 구현하고 있습니다.\r\r\nSignal은 애플리케이션 상태를 관리하는 방식으로, 상태 변경 시 UI를 업데이트합니다. React의 상태 변경이 전체 리렌더링을 유발하는 반면, Signal은 세분화된 상태 변경을 처리하여 렌더링 없이 최소한의 작업으로 UI를 갱신합니다. 이 제안을 통해 여러 프레임워크에서 중복된 Reactivity 모델을 제거하고, 개발 도구에서도 Signal의 활용이 기대됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Build Signals from Scratch](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-reactivity-build-signals-from-scratch/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Temporal\r\r\n\r\r\n새로운 날짜 및 시간 처리 기능인 Temporal이 [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)에 도달했습니다. 기존 JavaScript의 `Date` 객체가 가진 문제들을 해결하기 위해 설계되었으며, 개발자들이 보다 직관적이고 강력한 시간 처리를 할 수 있도록 도울 것입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [JS Dates are about to be fixed](https://docs.timetime.in/blog/js-dates-finally-fixed)\r\r\n\r\r\n### ECMAScript 2024\r\r\n\r\r\n2024년 ECMAScript 언어 사양이 승인되면서 새로운 기능들이 추가되었습니다. 주요 기능으로는 `Promise.withResolvers()`, `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy` 등이 있습니다. 과거처럼 대규모 신규 개념이 추가되기보다는 기존 기능의 개선과 최적화가 주를 이루는 모습입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [ECMAScript 2024](https://2ality.com/2024/06/ecmascript-2024.html)\r\r\n* [What's new in ECMAScript 2024](https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2024/)\r\r\n* [The state of ES5 on the web](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-state-of-es5-on-the-web/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기타\r\r\n\r\r\nTC39는 기존에 JavaScript 표준 프로세스에서 Stage를 [0~4 단계](https://tc39.es/process-document/)로 유지했으나, 최근 [Stage 2.7](https://thenewstack.io/inside-ecmascript-javascript-standard-gets-an-extra-stage/)을 추가했습니다. 이는 Stage 3에서 Stage 2로 롤백될 경우 발생하는 리소스를 줄이고, 작업 효율성을 향상시키기 위한 조치로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## CSS\r\r\n\r\r\n### CSS-in-JS\r\r\n\r\r\nCSS-in-JS는 SSR의 활성화에 따라 한동안 인기를 잃어 왔지만 React v19의 새로운 기능으로 다시 주목을 받고 있습니다. 특히 스타일 호이스팅(precedence 속성을 사용해 `<style>` 태그를 문서 헤드로 이동)을 지원하며, 온디맨드 스타일 렌더링이 개선되었습니다. 이에 따라 [Restyle](https://www.restyle.dev/), [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/blog/introducing-stylex), [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/)와 같은 라이브러리가 주목 받고 있으며, MUI는 [PigmentCSS의 도입](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css)을 시도하고 있습니다. 또한 CSS-in-JS의 리소스 문제를 극복한 Compiled CSS-in-JS 방식도 주목을 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [CSS in React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/css-in-rsc/)\r\r\n* [Why is CSS-in-JS slow?](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/why-is-css-in-js-slow)\r\r\n* [A preview of Pigment CSS: the next generation of CSS-in-JS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### CSS 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\n2024년에는 CSS의 새로운 스펙들이 도입되며, 작년에 이어 [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline)과 [Interop](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024)과 같이 플랫폼 간 상호운용성에 대한 노력이 CSS 생태계가 더욱 강력하게 만들고 있습니다. `@property` 문법으로 CSS 변수를 선언하고 속성을 정의하거나, Popover API로 번거롭던 Modal 문제를 해결하는 등 개발자의 생산성을 크게 향상시키고 있습니다. 이번에는 2024년 도입된 주요 기능과 개인적으로 관심을 가졌던 최신 CSS 관련 링크를 공유 드립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [CSS Container Queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/)\r\r\n* [If CSS gets inline conditionals](https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/)\r\r\n* [CSS anchor API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api)\r\r\n* [Popover API lands in Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/popover-api)\r\r\n* [The undeniable utility of CSS `:has`](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/has/)\r\r\n* [CSS `@property` and the new style](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/css-property-new-style/)\r\r\n* [New CSS that can actually be used in 2024](https://thomasorus.com/new-css-that-can-actually-be-used-in-2024.html)\r\r\n* [Old Dogs, new CSS Tricks](https://mxb.dev/blog/old-dogs-new-css-tricks/)\r\r\n* [A Framework for evaluating browser support](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/browser-support/)\r\r\n* [CSS Wrapped 2024](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2024/)\r\r\n* ▶️ [Amazing CSS in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D79TND9w_AY)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Masonry 레이아웃\r\r\n\r\r\n오랫동안 웹 개발자들은 Pinterest 스타일의 Masonry 레이아웃을 구현하기 위해 JavaScript에 의존해왔습니다.  그러나 이제 CSS가 이 기능을 네이티브로 지원할 준비를 하고 있으며 이를 구현하는 방식에 대해 [Chrome팀](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2024/09/21/masonry-and-good-defaults)과 [Webkit팀](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/) 간에 새로운 `display`를 추가할지, `grid` 내에 통합할지 [논의](https://webkit.org/blog/16026/css-masonry-syntax/)가 이어지고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Performance\r\r\n\r\r\n### e18e\r\r\n\r\r\nJavaScript 생태계의 성능 향상을 목표로 한 커뮤니티 기반 이니셔티브 [e18e(Ecosystem Performance)](https://e18e.dev/)가 실질적인 진전을 이루며 주목 받고 있습니다. e18e는 다음 세 가지 목표를 중심으로 자바스크립트 생태계의 개선을 추진하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Clean up: 인기 있는 패키지의 중복된 의존성 제거 또는 대체를 통해 속도를 최적화.\r\r\n2. Speed up: 널리 사용되는 패키지와 프레임워크의 성능 개선.\r\r\n3. Level up: 오래된 패키지에 대해 더 가볍고 모던한 대안을 마련.\r\r\n\r\r\n이니셔티브의 노력은 커뮤니티의 참여로 이루어지며, 최신 패치 목록과 대안을 제안하는 [module-replacements](https://github.com/es-tooling/module-replacements)와 같은 결과물로 나타나고 있습니다.\r\r\n최근 공개된 [October Contribution Showcase](https://e18e.dev/blog/october-contributions-showcase.html)에서는 Storybook과 ESLint 같이 널리 사용되는 도구에 대한 기여가 눈에 띕니다. 이를 통해 e18e는 자바스크립트 생태계의 전반적인 성능을 끌어올리는 데 실질적인 역할을 하고 있으며, 커뮤니티와 오픈 소스 생태계의 협력을 이끌어내고 있습니다.\r\r\ne18e는 단순히 성능 개선을 넘어, 개발자들이 사용하는 핵심 도구를 더 가볍고 빠르게 만들어 생태계 전반에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 것으로 기대됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Web Vitals - INP\r\r\n\r\r\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals)는 Google이 정의한 웹 성능 지표로, 사용자 경험(UX)을 개선하기 위한 기준을 제공합니다. 2024년 정식으로 선정된 [INP(Interaction to Next Paint)](https://web.dev/articles/inp)는 사용자 상호작용 후 다음 화면이 렌더링될 때까지의 지연 시간과 응답성을 측정하며, 기존 FID(First Input Delay)보다 더 포괄적이고 실질적인 경험을 반영합니다.

React Native는 [새로운 아키텍처](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here)로 재작성되어 [v0.76](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture)에서 동기식 네이티브 통신, 동시성 시스템, 새로운 이벤트 루프를 도입하며 성능과 안정성을 크게 개선했습니다. 한편, Google의 Flutter는 최근 조직 축소와 커뮤니티 대응 지연으로 비판을 받아 왔으며, 이에 대응해 커뮤니티가 Flutter를 포크한 [Flock](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why)를 발표했습니다. Flock은 문제 해결에 집중하고 있지만 인원 부족으로 인상적인 성과를 내기 어려울 것이라는 전망도 있습니다. 이러한 변화들은 크로스 플랫폼 개발의 미래를 더욱 흥미롭게 만들고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Architecture\r\r\n\r\r\n개인적으로 소프트웨어 설계 관련해 기억나는 포스트는 C4 모델을 응용한 Visualizing Frontend Architecture와 FSD(Feature-Sliced Design)입니다. C4 모델은 소프트웨어 시스템을 Context, Container, Component, Code의 4가지 레벨로 나누어 시각화하는 방식으로, 이를 프론트엔드에 적용해 아키텍처를 명확히 표현한 접근이 인상 깊었습니다.\r\r\n한편, FSD는 기능(feature) 단위로 관심사를 분리하여 모듈화된 폴더 구조를 설계하는 방식으로, 대규모 프로젝트의 유지 보수성과 확장성을 크게 향상시킵니다. 이러한 접근법들은 구조적 명확성을 제공하며, 올해 프론트엔드 설계에서 중요한 흐름으로 자리 잡았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* ▶️ [Visualising software architecture with the C4 model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2-rSnhpw0g)\r\r\n* [Visualizing Frontend Architecture](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/17)\r\r\n* [Feature-Slided Design Pattern](https://feature-sliced.design/)\r\r\n* [FSD 관점으로 바라보는 코드 경계 찾기](https://velog.io/@teo/fsd)\r\r\n* [프론트엔드 개발자 관점으로 바라보는 관심사의 분리와 좋은 폴더 구조 (feat.

NHN Cloud NCUI개발팀 이진우입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n저는 올해 2월부터 매주 프론트엔드 관련 다양한 뉴스레터를 읽고, FE 개발 직무 동료들에게 흥미로운 뉴스, 읽을거리, 유용한 도구 등을 공유해 왔습니다.\r\r\n어느덧 연말이 가까워지며 쌓여 온 링크들은 상당한 양이 되었는데요. 이를 정리하며 개인적으로 인상 깊었던 주제와 도구를 공유드리고자 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n물론, 개인적인 관심사가 반영되어 있기도 하고, 조직 내에서 영향이 큰 프레임워크나 기술 스택 위주로 정리된 만큼 부족한 부분이 있을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n훑어보시면서 혹시 낯설거나 관심이 가는 주제가 있다면 함께 제공한 읽을거리 링크가 도움이 되기를 바랍니다.\r\r\n(정리된 내용 중 일부는 시간이 지나며 업데이트되거나 새로운 정보로 대체되었을 수 있습니다. )\r\r\n\r\r\n## 프론트엔드 기술 스택\r\r\n\r\r\n프론트엔드 개발은 마치 9G 중력 가속도처럼 빠르게 변하며 개발자들을 압박해 왔지만 최근엔 변화의 속도가 다소 안정된 듯한 느낌입니다. ☕️ 새로운 개념을 바탕으로 한 프레임워크와 도구가 끊임없이 쏟아졌던 과거와 달리, 이제는 더 나은 생산성과 사용자 경험을 위한 실용적인 도구들이 점차 정착되고 있습니다. 2024년에 출시되진 않았지만, 개인적으로 올해 활약상이 인상 깊었던 몇 가지 라이브러리를 소개하고자 합니다. ‍\r\r\n\r\r\n### shadcn/ui\r\r\n\r\r\n[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)는 TailwindCSS와 Headless UI의 철학을 결합한 라이브러리로, 복사-붙여넣기(copy-paste) 방식으로 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있는 점이 특징입니다. 개발자는 필요한 컴포넌트를 복사한 뒤, 프로젝트 요구에 맞게 간단히 수정하여 사용할 수 있어 효율성이 뛰어납니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [(번역) shadcn/ui의 해부](https://siosio3103.medium.com/shadcn-ui-%EC%9D%98-%ED%95%B4%EB%B6%80-ebd469c34614)\r\r\n* [How headless components became the future for building UI libraries](https://www.subframe.com/blog/how-headless-components-became-the-future-for-building-ui-libraries)\r\r\n* [Headless, boneless, skinless & lifeless UI](https://nerdy.dev/headless-boneless-and-skinless-ui)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Zod\r\r\n\r\r\n[Zod](https://zod.dev/)는 TypeScript와 완벽히 통합된 스키마 선언 및 데이터 검증 라이브러리로, 간결한 문법과 타입 추론을 통해 개발 생산성을 크게 높여 서버-클라이언트 간 데이터 구조를 명확하게 정의하고 유지할 수 있습니다. REST API, GraphQL, Form Data Validation 등 다양한 환경에서 활용 가능하며, 코드의 가독성을 유지하면서도 강력한 검증 로직을 구현할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [The process.env frontend time bomb](https://massimilianomirra.com/notes/the-frontend-process-env-time-bomb-plus-a-sustainable-definition-of-fixed)\r\r\n* [Making a REST API typesafe with Ready Query and Zod](https://noahflk.com/blog/typesafe-rest-api)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Vitest\r\r\n\r\r\n[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)는 Vite 기반의 테스트 러너로, 빠른 테스트 실행 속도와 간편한 설정으로 주목 받고 있습니다. 테스트 생태계의 하나의 표준과도 같았던 Jest와 유사한 API를 제공해 쉽게 전환이 가능하며, ESM과 TypeScript를 기본적으로 지원합니다. 특히 Vite와의 긴밀한 통합을 통해 개발 환경과 테스트 환경 간의 일관성을 유지할 수 있어 Vite 사용 시 더욱 효율적인 테스트 경험을 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Vitest vs. Jest](https://www.speakeasy.com/post/vitest-vs-jest)\r\r\n* [Storybook 8.3 - First class Vitest integration](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-8-3/)\r\r\n* [JavaScript unit testing frameworks in 2024: A comparison](https://raygun.com/blog/javascript-unit-testing-frameworks/#vitest)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기타\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)은 ESLint, Prettier의 대체 도구로 빠른 속도를 자랑합니다. 하지만 파일 간의 의존성이나 프로젝트 전반의 정보를 필요로 하는 정적 분석엔 아직 개선이 필요한데, 최근 Biome의 개발자는 [다중 파일 분석의 접근 방법](https://arendjr.nl/blog/2024/11/biome_approach_to_multi_file_analysis/)을 공유했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* 요즘 웹사이트만 들어가면 쿠키 동의 때문에 정신없으시죠? GDPR(general data protection regulation)을 준수하기 위함인데 이와 관련된 라이브러리들([cookieconsent](https://github.com/brainsum/cookieconsent), [cookie checker](https://complydog.com/free-cookie-checker-tool))이 눈에 띄었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* Zod의 대안으로 Yup, AJV, Joi, Superstruct 등이 있지만 TypeScript와의 통합이 부족하거나, 기능이 부족하거나, 러닝 커브가 높기도 합니다. 하지만 최근 [Vailbot](https://valibot.dev/)이 v1 베타 기간을 갖고 있는데, 더 작은 번들 사이즈로도 Zod와 유사한 기능을 제공해 주목을 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [TanStack](https://tanstack.com/)은 Tanner Linsley가 운영하는 라이브러리 생태계로, 현재 9개 라이브러리를 운영하며 프론트엔드 개발에서 빠르게 주목 받고 있습니다. 특히 알파 단계인 TanStack Start 프레임워크는 Next.js의 잠재적 경쟁자로 화제가 되고 있으며, TanStack Router는 SSR을 강력히 지원하며 클라이언트 사이드의 인터랙션도 최적화합니다. 또한, 엔터프라이즈급 라우팅을 타입 안전하게 구현하며, 번들링 및 배포는 [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi)를 통해 처리해 높은 성능과 유연성을 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## React\r\r\n\r\r\n### React Deep Dive\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 FE 개발 조직은 React를 사용하고 있는데요. 사실 React로 기술 스택을 전환한 지는 React의 역사에 비해 그리 오래되지 않았습니다. 시간이 지남에 따라 React 사용에 익숙해지면서 내부 동작 원리에 대한 호기심이 생겼고, 조직 내 몇 명이 모여 React 내부 구조를 알아보는 스터디를 시작했습니다. ‍ 아래는 스터디 과정에서 참고했던 링크들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [React 톺아보기](https://goidle.github.io/react/in-depth-react-preview/)\r\r\n* [(번역) A deep dive into React Fiber internals](https://bumkeyy.gitbook.io/bumkeyy-code/frontend/a-deep-dive-into-react-fiber-internals)\r\r\n* ▶️ [React 파이버 아키텍처 분석](https://d2.naver.com/helloworld/2690975)\r\r\n* ▶️ [Inside React (동시성을 구현하는 기술)](https://deview.kr/2021/sessions/518)\r\r\n\r\r\n### React 19\r\r\n\r\r\nReact팀은 v19 업데이트를 위해 많은 노력을 기울였습니다. 하지만 최초 v19 RC가 공개된 후 Suspense의 동작 변경으로 인해 여러 컴포넌트가 순차적으로 데이터를 가져오게 되는 워터폴 현상이 발생했습니다.  React 팀은 이 동작이 의도된 동작이 아님을 확인하고 수정하겠다고 밝혔습니다. 이 사건은 오픈 소스 커뮤니티에서 투명한 소통과 협력의 중요성을 다시 한번 환기시켰습니다. 현재 React v19는 `prewarming`이라는 기능을 통해 이슈를 해소하며, 다시 RC v1 단계를 거쳐 현재 [v19](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases/tag/v19.0.0)를 릴리스했습니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n* [React 19 and suspense](https://tkdodo.eu/blog/react-19-and-suspense-a-drama-in-3-acts)\r\r\n* [React core PR - sibiling pre-rendering feature](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/29898#issuecomment-2477449973)\r\r\n* [What's new in react 19](https://vercel.com/blog/whats-new-in-react-19)\r\r\n* [Server Actions have been renamed to Server Functions](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions)\r\r\n\r\r\n### React Compiler\r\r\n\r\r\nReact v19만큼이나 커뮤니티를 들썩이게 만든 또 다른 주제는 바로 React Compiler(코드명: Forget ‍️)입니다. React는 상태 변경과 리렌더링을 중심으로 동작하지만, 때로는 memoization을 통해 이러한 동작을 최적화해야 할 때가 있습니다. 그러나 이 과정에서 가독성이 떨어지고 오류가 발생하는 경우가 많았습니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 React Compiler가 등장했죠. \r\r\n\r\r\nReact Compiler는 memoization 최적화를 자동으로 처리할 뿐만 아니라, 앞으로는 JSX Inlining과 JSX Outlining 같은 기능도 지원할 예정입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\\- JSX Inlining: 불필요한 JSX Runtime 호출을 제거하고 미리 빌드된 JSX 객체를 삽입\\.\r\r\n\\- JSX Outlining: 컴파일러가 하위 컴포넌트를 자동으로 추출하여 최적화\\.\r\r\n\r\r\n현재 [베타 릴리스](https://react.dev/blog/2024/10/21/react-compiler-beta-release) 단계이며, React v17 이상에서 사용할 수 있습니다. ✨\r\r\n\r\r\n* [(번역) 리액트 컴파일러 사용법](https://junghan92.medium.com/%EB%B2%88%EC%97%AD-%EB%A6%AC%EC%95%A1%ED%8A%B8-%EC%BB%B4%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC%EB%9F%AC-%EC%82%AC%EC%9A%A9%EB%B2%95-%EC%99%84%EB%B2%BD-%EA%B0%80%EC%9D%B4%EB%93%9C-a6a0e96edc97)\r\r\n* [Understanding React Compiler](https://tonyalicea.dev/blog/understanding-react-compiler/)\r\r\n* [Alias analysis in the React Compiler](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/alias-analysis/)\r\r\n* [Compiler Theory and Reactivity](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/ssa/)\r\r\n* [Type system of the React Compiler](https://www.recompiled.dev/blog/type-system/)\r\r\n* ▶️ [What's next for the react compiler?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd5yk2gxbtg)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Next.js\r\r\n\r\r\n[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)는 React 기반의 풀스택 프레임워크로, 서버와 클라이언트 렌더링을 유연하게 결합해 강력한 개발 경험을 제공합니다. 특히 App Router와 React Server Components(RSC)의 도입으로 동적 라우팅과 성능 최적화가 크게 강화되었습니다.\r\r\n올해 Next.js는 [v14.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-14-2), v15 RC [v1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc), [v2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc2)를 거쳐 정식으로 [v15](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15)를 릴리스했습니다. 여기에 모노레포(monorepo) 관리를 위한 Turborepo와 차세대 번들러인 Turbopack 또한 긴밀히 통합해 Next.js 생태계를 구축하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How vercel adopted microfrontends](https://vercel.com/blog/how-vercel-adopted-microfrontends)\r\r\n* [Turbopack Dev is now stable](https://nextjs.org/blog/turbopack-for-development-stable)\r\r\n* [How to set up next.js 15 for production in 2024](https://www.reactsquad.io/blog/how-to-set-up-next-js-15-for-production)\r\r\n* [Vercel functions -

Wiz는 Gmail, Search와 같은 성능이 중요한 서비스에서 사용되는 프레임워크로 이번 통합은 SSR 지원 강화를 목적으로 이루어졌습니다. 이어 5월에는 [v18](https://blog.angular.dev/angular-v18-is-now-available-e79d5ac0affe)을 발표하며 변경 감지 라이브러리 추출, 홈페이지 개편, 그리고 SSR 기능 강화를 진행했습니다. 11월에는 [v19](https://blog.angular.dev/meet-angular-v19-7b29dfd05b84)가 [릴리스](https://github.com/angular/angular/releases/tag/19.0.0)되며, 부족했던 렌더링 모드의 다양화, Hydration 제어 개선, 그리고 Signal 도입이라는 큰 변화를 선보였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Google Angular Lead sees convergence in JavaScript Framework](https://thenewstack.io/google-angular-lead-sees-convergence-in-javascript-frameworks/)\r\r\n* [Managing Angular](https://blog.mgechev.com/2024/08/25/managing-angular/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Svelte\r\r\n\r\r\nSvelte는 [v5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-is-alive) 릴리스를 통해 패러다임의 전환을 알렸습니다. 과거에는 `let count = 0`만 작성해도 Svelte의 컴파일러가 이를 상태로 처리했지만, 이제는 더 명시적으로 상태를 선언하는 방식으로 변화했습니다. 새로운 메커니즘인 [runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes)가 도입되었으며, `$state()`를 통해 반응형 상태를 명확히 관리할 수 있게 되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Astro\r\r\n\r\r\nAstro는 최근 [v5](https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/) 업데이트에서 타입 안전 환경 변수 설정을 지원하며 환경 변수의 가시성과 안전성을 강화했습니다. 또한 Content Layer API를 통해 다양한 데이터 소스에서 가져온 콘텐츠를 타입 안전하게 관리할 수 있게 되었으며, 렌더링 기능을 강화해 페이지와 컴포넌트별로 SSR과 정적 생성을 유연하게 선택할 수 있게 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Hono\r\r\n\r\r\n[Hono](https://hono.dev/)는 모든 JavaScript Runtime에서 실행 가능한 경량 웹 서버 프레임워크로, 빠른 라우팅을 지원하는 RegExpRouter 개념과 여러 헬퍼, 미들웨어로 주목 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Waku\r\r\n\r\r\n[Waku](https://waku.gg/)는 Zustand와 Jotai 진영에서 개발한 리액트 기반 풀스택 프레임워크로, React의 Server Action API를 지원하는 [v0.21](https://waku.gg/blog/server-actions-are-here)을 출시했습니다. 중규모 애플리케이션 개발을 목표로 하며, Next.js의 대안으로 기대를 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 다양한 렌더링 모드\r\r\n\r\r\n최근 프론트엔드 프레임워크들은 다양한 렌더링 방식을 제공하여 각자의 장점을 활용한 최적화 전략을 선보이고 있습니다.\r\r\nCSR(Client-Side Rendering)은 동적이고 빠른 사용자 경험(UX)을 제공하지만, 초기 HTML이 서버에서 제공되지 않기 때문에 SEO에는 다소 불리합니다.\r\r\n이에 반해, SSR(Server-Side Rendering)과 SSG(Static-Site Generation)은 초기 페이지 로드 시 완전한 HTML을 제공해 SEO와 성능 최적화에 유리합니다. Astro는 [Islands Architecture](https://jasonformat.com/islands-architecture)를 활용해 정적 콘텐츠와 인터랙티브 요소를 분리하고, Server Islands를 통해 필요한 동적 콘텐츠만 효율적으로 로드합니다. 또한, Next.js는 [PPR(Partial Pre-Rendering)](https://vercel.com/blog/partial-prerendering-with-next-js-creating-a-new-default-rendering-model)을 통해 동적 콘텐츠를 스트리밍 하며 점진적 렌더링 방식을 선도하고 있습니다.\r\r\n이런 다양한 렌더링 방식들은 앱의 목적과 성능 요구 사항에 따라 적절히 선택할 필요가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Client-Side Rendering](https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering)\r\r\n* [What's a Single-Page App?](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/whats-a-single-page-app/)\r\r\n* [How to choose the best rendering strategy for your app](https://vercel.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-rendering-strategy-for-your-app)\r\r\n\r\r\n## JavaScript\r\r\n\r\r\n### Signals\r\r\n\r\r\nECMAScript 위원회인 TC39에 [Signal 도입 제안](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals)이 올라왔습니다. [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Solid](https://solidjs.com/)와 같은 프레임워크는 이미 Signal을 활용하여 Reactivity를 구현하고 있습니다.\r\r\nSignal은 애플리케이션 상태를 관리하는 방식으로, 상태 변경 시 UI를 업데이트합니다. React의 상태 변경이 전체 리렌더링을 유발하는 반면, Signal은 세분화된 상태 변경을 처리하여 렌더링 없이 최소한의 작업으로 UI를 갱신합니다. 이 제안을 통해 여러 프레임워크에서 중복된 Reactivity 모델을 제거하고, 개발 도구에서도 Signal의 활용이 기대됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Build Signals from Scratch](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-reactivity-build-signals-from-scratch/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Temporal\r\r\n\r\r\n새로운 날짜 및 시간 처리 기능인 Temporal이 [Stage 3](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal)에 도달했습니다. 기존 JavaScript의 `Date` 객체가 가진 문제들을 해결하기 위해 설계되었으며, 개발자들이 보다 직관적이고 강력한 시간 처리를 할 수 있도록 도울 것입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [JS Dates are about to be fixed](https://docs.timetime.in/blog/js-dates-finally-fixed)\r\r\n\r\r\n### ECMAScript 2024\r\r\n\r\r\n2024년 ECMAScript 언어 사양이 승인되면서 새로운 기능들이 추가되었습니다. 주요 기능으로는 `Promise.withResolvers()`, `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy` 등이 있습니다. 과거처럼 대규모 신규 개념이 추가되기보다는 기존 기능의 개선과 최적화가 주를 이루는 모습입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [ECMAScript 2024](https://2ality.com/2024/06/ecmascript-2024.html)\r\r\n* [What's new in ECMAScript 2024](https://pawelgrzybek.com/whats-new-in-ecmascript-2024/)\r\r\n* [The state of ES5 on the web](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-state-of-es5-on-the-web/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기타\r\r\n\r\r\nTC39는 기존에 JavaScript 표준 프로세스에서 Stage를 [0~4 단계](https://tc39.es/process-document/)로 유지했으나, 최근 [Stage 2.7](https://thenewstack.io/inside-ecmascript-javascript-standard-gets-an-extra-stage/)을 추가했습니다. 이는 Stage 3에서 Stage 2로 롤백될 경우 발생하는 리소스를 줄이고, 작업 효율성을 향상시키기 위한 조치로 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## CSS\r\r\n\r\r\n### CSS-in-JS\r\r\n\r\r\nCSS-in-JS는 SSR의 활성화에 따라 한동안 인기를 잃어 왔지만 React v19의 새로운 기능으로 다시 주목을 받고 있습니다. 특히 스타일 호이스팅(precedence 속성을 사용해 `` 태그를 문서 헤드로 이동)을 지원하며, 온디맨드 스타일 렌더링이 개선되었습니다. 이에 따라 [Restyle](https://www.restyle.dev/), [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/blog/introducing-stylex), [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/)와 같은 라이브러리가 주목 받고 있으며, MUI는 [PigmentCSS의 도입](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css)을 시도하고 있습니다. 또한 CSS-in-JS의 리소스 문제를 극복한 Compiled CSS-in-JS 방식도 주목을 받고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [CSS in React Server Components](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/css-in-rsc/)\r\r\n* [Why is CSS-in-JS slow?](https://playfulprogramming.com/posts/why-is-css-in-js-slow)\r\r\n* [A preview of Pigment CSS: the next generation of CSS-in-JS](https://mui.com/blog/introducing-pigment-css/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### CSS 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\n2024년에는 CSS의 새로운 스펙들이 도입되며, 작년에 이어 [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline)과 [Interop](https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024)과 같이 플랫폼 간 상호운용성에 대한 노력이 CSS 생태계가 더욱 강력하게 만들고 있습니다. `@property` 문법으로 CSS 변수를 선언하고 속성을 정의하거나, Popover API로 번거롭던 Modal 문제를 해결하는 등 개발자의 생산성을 크게 향상시키고 있습니다. 이번에는 2024년 도입된 주요 기능과 개인적으로 관심을 가졌던 최신 CSS 관련 링크를 공유 드립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [CSS Container Queries](https://css-tricks.com/css-container-queries/)\r\r\n* [If CSS gets inline conditionals](https://css-tricks.com/if-css-gets-inline-conditionals/)\r\r\n* [CSS anchor API](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/anchor-positioning-api)\r\r\n* [Popover API lands in Baseline](https://web.dev/blog/popover-api)\r\r\n* [The undeniable utility of CSS `:has`](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/has/)\r\r\n* [CSS `@property` and the new style](https://ryanmulligan.dev/blog/css-property-new-style/)\r\r\n* [New CSS that can actually be used in 2024](https://thomasorus.com/new-css-that-can-actually-be-used-in-2024.html)\r\r\n* [Old Dogs, new CSS Tricks](https://mxb.dev/blog/old-dogs-new-css-tricks/)\r\r\n* [A Framework for evaluating browser support](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/browser-support/)\r\r\n* [CSS Wrapped 2024](https://chrome.dev/css-wrapped-2024/)\r\r\n* ▶️ [Amazing CSS in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D79TND9w_AY)\r\r\n\r\r\n### Masonry 레이아웃\r\r\n\r\r\n오랫동안 웹 개발자들은 Pinterest 스타일의 Masonry 레이아웃을 구현하기 위해 JavaScript에 의존해왔습니다.  그러나 이제 CSS가 이 기능을 네이티브로 지원할 준비를 하고 있으며 이를 구현하는 방식에 대해 [Chrome팀](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2024/09/21/masonry-and-good-defaults)과 [Webkit팀](https://webkit.org/blog/15269/help-us-invent-masonry-layouts-for-css-grid-level-3/) 간에 새로운 `display`를 추가할지, `grid` 내에 통합할지 [논의](https://webkit.org/blog/16026/css-masonry-syntax/)가 이어지고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Performance\r\r\n\r\r\n### e18e\r\r\n\r\r\nJavaScript 생태계의 성능 향상을 목표로 한 커뮤니티 기반 이니셔티브 [e18e(Ecosystem Performance)](https://e18e.dev/)가 실질적인 진전을 이루며 주목 받고 있습니다. e18e는 다음 세 가지 목표를 중심으로 자바스크립트 생태계의 개선을 추진하고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Clean up: 인기 있는 패키지의 중복된 의존성 제거 또는 대체를 통해 속도를 최적화.\r\r\n2. Speed up: 널리 사용되는 패키지와 프레임워크의 성능 개선.\r\r\n3. Level up: 오래된 패키지에 대해 더 가볍고 모던한 대안을 마련.\r\r\n\r\r\n이니셔티브의 노력은 커뮤니티의 참여로 이루어지며, 최신 패치 목록과 대안을 제안하는 [module-replacements](https://github.com/es-tooling/module-replacements)와 같은 결과물로 나타나고 있습니다.\r\r\n최근 공개된 [October Contribution Showcase](https://e18e.dev/blog/october-contributions-showcase.html)에서는 Storybook과 ESLint 같이 널리 사용되는 도구에 대한 기여가 눈에 띕니다. 이를 통해 e18e는 자바스크립트 생태계의 전반적인 성능을 끌어올리는 데 실질적인 역할을 하고 있으며, 커뮤니티와 오픈 소스 생태계의 협력을 이끌어내고 있습니다.\r\r\ne18e는 단순히 성능 개선을 넘어, 개발자들이 사용하는 핵심 도구를 더 가볍고 빠르게 만들어 생태계 전반에 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 것으로 기대됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Web Vitals - INP\r\r\n\r\r\n[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals)는 Google이 정의한 웹 성능 지표로, 사용자 경험(UX)을 개선하기 위한 기준을 제공합니다. 2024년 정식으로 선정된 [INP(Interaction to Next Paint)](https://web.dev/articles/inp)는 사용자 상호작용 후 다음 화면이 렌더링될 때까지의 지연 시간과 응답성을 측정하며, 기존 FID(First Input Delay)보다 더 포괄적이고 실질적인 경험을 반영합니다.

React Native는 [새로운 아키텍처](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/the-new-architecture-is-here)로 재작성되어 [v0.76](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2024/10/23/release-0.76-new-architecture)에서 동기식 네이티브 통신, 동시성 시스템, 새로운 이벤트 루프를 도입하며 성능과 안정성을 크게 개선했습니다. 한편, Google의 Flutter는 최근 조직 축소와 커뮤니티 대응 지연으로 비판을 받아 왔으며, 이에 대응해 커뮤니티가 Flutter를 포크한 [Flock](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why)를 발표했습니다. Flock은 문제 해결에 집중하고 있지만 인원 부족으로 인상적인 성과를 내기 어려울 것이라는 전망도 있습니다. 이러한 변화들은 크로스 플랫폼 개발의 미래를 더욱 흥미롭게 만들고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Architecture\r\r\n\r\r\n개인적으로 소프트웨어 설계 관련해 기억나는 포스트는 C4 모델을 응용한 Visualizing Frontend Architecture와 FSD(Feature-Sliced Design)입니다. C4 모델은 소프트웨어 시스템을 Context, Container, Component, Code의 4가지 레벨로 나누어 시각화하는 방식으로, 이를 프론트엔드에 적용해 아키텍처를 명확히 표현한 접근이 인상 깊었습니다.\r\r\n한편, FSD는 기능(feature) 단위로 관심사를 분리하여 모듈화된 폴더 구조를 설계하는 방식으로, 대규모 프로젝트의 유지 보수성과 확장성을 크게 향상시킵니다. 이러한 접근법들은 구조적 명확성을 제공하며, 올해 프론트엔드 설계에서 중요한 흐름으로 자리 잡았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* ▶️ [Visualising software architecture with the C4 model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2-rSnhpw0g)\r\r\n* [Visualizing Frontend Architecture](https://frontendatscale.com/issues/17)\r\r\n* [Feature-Slided Design Pattern](https://feature-sliced.design/)\r\r\n* [FSD 관점으로 바라보는 코드 경계 찾기](https://velog.io/@teo/fsd)\r\r\n* [프론트엔드 개발자 관점으로 바라보는 관심사의 분리와 좋은 폴더 구조 (feat. FSD)](https://velog.io/@teo/separation-of-concerns-of-frontend)\r\r\n\r\r\n### IT 뉴스\r\r\n\r\r\n* 미국 법무부는 2024년, ADA(미국 장애인 법)에 따라 웹 콘텐츠와 모바일 애플리케이션의 [접근성 규정을 발표](https://www.tpgi.com/the-ada-now-has-regulations-for-accessibility-of-web-content-and-mobile-apps/)했습니다. 이는 공공 기관이 운영하는 디지털 콘텐츠가 WCAG 2.1 레벨 AA 기준을 충족하도록 요구하며, 장애인을 위한 더 나은 디지털 접근성을 보장합니다. 민간 기업에도 간접적인 영향을 미칠 것으로 보입니다.\r\r\n* 영국 정부가 인도양 차고스 제도(British Indian Ocean Territory)의 주권을 포기하며 [.io 도메인이 사라질 예정](https://every.to/p/the-disappearance-of-an-internet-domain)입니다. 새로운 등록이 중단되며, 기존 도메인 역시 점진적으로 폐기 프로세스가 시작됩니다. .io 도메인을 사용하는 많은 기업에 영향을 미칠 것으로 보입니다. 하지만 .su 도메인이 특수 사례로 살아남은 적이 있어 어떤 식으로 흘러갈지는 지켜봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n* 올해 Sentry는 [페어 소스(Fair Source)](https://fair.io/)라는 새로운 소프트웨어 라이선스를 도입한다고 했습니다. 이는 오픈 소스와 유사하게 코드를 공개적으로 공유하지만, 제작자의 비즈니스 모델을 보호하기 위해 사용, 수정, 재배포에 제한을 두는 것이 특징입니다. 또한 지연된 오픈소스 퍼블리싱(DOSP) 방식으로 초기에는 독점 라이선스를 유지하다가 일정 계획에 따라 오픈소스화합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n***\r\r\n\r\r\n막상 정리를 해보겠다고 마음먹고 주요 기술 스택과 뉴스를 간추리는 데 생각보다 시간이 오래 걸렸습니다. 내년에도 같은 작업을 이어간다면 반기로 나누어 진행해야 할 것 같습니다. 처음에는 2~3개의 뉴스레터로 시작했지만, 욕심이 생겨 점점 범위를 넓히다 보니 지금은 UI/UX와 디자인까지 포함해 매주 약 19개의 뉴스레터를 훑고 있는 상황입니다. \r\r\n\r\r\n뉴스레터로 알게 된 내용을 실제로 제품에 적용해 볼 기회는 많지 않았지만, 프론트엔드 트렌드를 파악하고, 우리 팀과 조직에서 적용해 볼 만한 부분을 점검할 수 있었다는 점에서 개인적으로 만족스러웠습니다. 본 글에서 다루지 못했지만 JavaScript의 AI, Privacy 강화, WASM과 같은 주제에도 변화가 있었습니다. 관심 있는 분들은 관련 내용을 찾아보시는 것도 추천드립니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n앞으로도 새롭게 등장할 기술들 속에서 각자의 서비스에 적합한 것을 선택하고 도입하며, 변화에 유연하게 대응해 나가길 바랍니다. \r\r\n(혹시라도 깨진 링크나 잘못된 내용이 있다면 제보 부탁드립니다. )\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup banner_footer_blue_202412_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2024/techblog/NHN%20Cloudmeetup%20bannerfooterblue202412900.png)](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr)",

(탐론 28-200m 구입)\n1년 10개월 뒤 2024년 12월 1일 삿포로에 방문했다. 눈과 가득 찬 구름으로 일기예보에도 12월 2일은 유난히 맑음이었다.  다음 날 아사히카와로 향했고 14시 30분쯤 역에 도착했다.\n정상에서 일몰 사진을 찍으려면 택시를 타야 했다. \nアイヌ文化の森 (아이누 문화의 숲) 또는 北邦野草園 (호쿠호 와일드플라워 가든)으로 가달라고 하면 된다. 2,400엔 정도 나온다.\n\nHokuho Wildflower Garden 北邦野草園\n\n등산로\n\n\n홋카이도(일본)와 한국 시차는 없지만 실질적으로 홋카이도 일몰이 빠르기 때문에 체감상 2~3시간 정도의 시차가 느껴진다. (실제로 아사히카와 12월 2일 일몰 시간은 15시 50분 정도다.) \n낮은 산임에도 눈이 내렸던 탓에 길이 미끄러워 고생을 했다. 20분 정도 걸렸다.\n정상에서 울분에 찬 셔터를 우다다 터트렸다.\n\n\n\n\n\n감사합니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "난 건강한 편이고, 건강 관리도 잘하는 편이라서 지금까지 큰 병은 없었다. 올해 나이의 앞자리가 5로 바뀌면서 건강 관리를 조금 더 잘하고 체계적으로 하기 위한 일환으로 최근 몇 년 동안의 건강 검진 결과를 다 펼쳐놓고 중요한 수치들의 변화를 트래킹하고, 이 수치들과 다른 수치들, 그리고 내 몸의 실제 상태를 비교해 보기 시작했다.\n실은 몇 년 전만 해도 이렇게 하는 건 어려웠다. 일단 모든 수치들을 한 번에 정리하는 데 걸리는 시간도 만만치 않았지만, 각 항목이 뭘 의미하는지 잘 모르기 때문에 하나씩 검색을 해야 했다. 의사들에게 물어보면 더 자세한 설명을 들을 수 있을 것 같았는데, 지금까지 내가 경험했던 의사들은 환자를 돈으로만 봐서 자세한 설명도 안 해주고, 그 특유의 권위 의식이 싫어서 별로 말을 섞고 싶지가 않았다. 실은, 내가 최근에 가장 관심을 갖는 게, 인체라는 복합적인 유기체의 수많은 기관과 기능 간의 상관관계인데 이런 질문을 의사들에게 하면 대부분 뭘 그런 것까지 알려고 하냐면서 무시하거나, 그건 나랑 상관없으니 알 필요 없다고 일축해 버린다. 예를 들면, 담배도 안 피고 운동도 규칙적으로 하는데, 갑자기 혈압이 오르면, 상황에 따라서 어떤 수치들을 확인해 봐야 하는지,,,뭐 이런 것들이다.\n하지만, ChatGPT가 등장하면서 많은 것이 바뀌었다. 이제 내 건강 data에 대해서 궁금한 질문을 마음껏 할 수 있고, 과거의 다른 의료 기관에서 받았던 다양한 수치를 한 번에 대량으로 입력하면 꽤 정확한 분석과 설명을 인간 의사의 거만함이나 권위 의식 없이 들을 수 있다. 이제 나는 과거 15년 이상의 건강검진 기록을 그냥 사진 찍어 올리면서, AI에게 내 40대와 50대 건강 상태에 대한 의견을 물어보고, 내가 주의 깊게 관찰하는 특정 기관들의 수치에 대해서 비교해달라고 한다. 그리고 그동안 매우 궁금했지만, 위에서 말 한 여러 가지 이유로 병원에서 못 물어봤던 것들을 정말 많이 물어보고, 이 질문들에 대한 답변을 잘 공부하고, 또 그 답변에 대해 더 많은 질문을 하고 있다.\n챗GPT가 인간 의사보다 좋은 점은 일단 병원과 의사에 대해서 agnostic 하다는 점이다. 이미 한 병원에서 혈액 검사를 광범위하게 해서 결과가 있는데, 다른 병원에 가면 항상 검사를 새로 한다. 다른 병원의 검사 결과를 못 믿어서인지, 아니면 그냥 병원 매출을 늘리기 위한 방법인지 모르겠지만, 나는 이게 항상 불만이었다. 엑스레이 검사도 다른 병원에서 찍은 걸 가져가면 제대로 안 보고 항상 다시 찍자고 하는 걸 경험했는데, AI는 그냥 이 모든 데이터를 입력만 하면 모든 것을 기계가 분석한다. 결과의 포맷이 다른 것도 상관없다. 잘 아시겠지만, AI는 모든 걸 알아서 엑셀로 정리까지 해 준다.\n전문가의 함정을 최대한 배제할 수 있다는 것도 인공지능의 장점 중 하나다. 인체는 정말 복잡한 유기체이다. 모든 기관과 기능이 상상 이상으로 밀접하게 연결되어 있다. 간 전문의는 간에 대해서는 잘 알겠지만, 다른 장기에 대해서는 잘 모르고, 특히 다른 장기들이 간과 어떻게 연결되어 있고, 본인들이 직접 임상해 보지 않았고, 관련 논문을 읽지 않았다면, 다른 인체의 변화와 간이 어떤 반응을 일으키는지 제한된 지식만 보유하고 있다. 그래서 많은 의사들이 본인의 전문 분야가 아닌 분야의 수치의 변화에는 큰 관심도 없고, 특히 나같이 상대적으로 건강한 사람이라면 그냥 신경 쓰지 않고 넘어가는 경우가 많다. AI는 이 분야에서 아주 탁월한 능력을 발휘한다. 모든 가능한 시나리오를 제시해 줄 수 있고, 엄청난 양의 논문과 데이터를 소화하면서 다양한 원인과 의견을 제공해 준다. 이런 각도에서 보면, 세상에서 가장 큰 종합병원이다.\n또 한 가지는, 챗GPT는 기억력이 매우 좋다는 점이다. 이미 내 건강에 대한 지식과 데이터가 상당히 많이 축적되어 있기 때문에 뭐라도 하나 물어보면, 인간 의사들같이 과거 차트 대충 보면서 건성으로 답변하지 않고 아주 자세히 건강 데이터, 과거 병력, 증상 등을 모두 다 비교 분석하면서 답변을 해준다.\n그런데도, 기계는 아직도 기계일 뿐이다. 챗GPT는 의사를 대체 할 수도 없고, 실은 치명적인 실수도 정말 많이 하는 불완전하고 환각으로 가득 찬 기계이다. 결국 제대로 된 최종 진단, 처방, 그리고 불안한 환자의 마음을 안심시킬 수 있는 제대로 된 휴먼 터치는 결국 인간 의사에게서만 나올 수 있다. 내가 아무리 챗GPT를 사랑해도, 결국 몸이 아프면 의사 선생님에게 올 인할 수밖에 없다.\n하지만, AI로 인해 환자와 의사의 관계가 – 특히, 항상 불리했던 환자의 입장에서 – 향상됐다는 점을 부인할 수 없다. 의사를 보기 전에 우린 챗GPT에 모든 궁금한 점들을 물어볼 수 있고, 이에 대한 꽤 완성도 높은 답변을 얻을 수 있다. 의사를 만나서 이걸 확인만 하면 되고, 훨씬 더 체계적인 질문과 대화를 할 수 있다. 내 경험상, AI를 통해서 충분히 학습하고 준비된 질문으로 무장한 환자들에겐 권위 의식으로 가득 찬 의사들도 함부로 대하진 못하고, 오히려 그들도 이런 환자들과의 수준 높은 대화를 즐기는 것 같다.\n앞으로 AI가 어느 수준까지 발전하고, 인간 의사들의 수준이 어디까지 떨어질지 모르겠지만, 여기에 큰 시장이 존재한다. 의학 vertical AI 시장도 매우 클 것이고, 환자의 건강을 정말로 신경 써주는 제대로 된 휴먼 의사에 대한 수요 또한 더 커질 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이번 주에 올해 내가 60권 이상의 책을 읽었다는 자랑을 했다. 해마다 50권의 목표를 설정하고, 책 종류와 분야는 특별히 가리지 않는 잡식성 독서를 하는데, 올해도 좋은 책을 많이 읽었고, 현재까지 62권을 읽었으니, 아마도 64권으로 올해를 마무리할 것 같다.\n실은 50권의 목표를 설정한 첫해에는 그냥 내가 그 해에 실제로 몇 권을 읽을 수 있을지 실험해 보려고 독서 관련 포스팅을 했는데, 이제 해마다 연말에 내가 몇 권의 책을 읽었는지 글을 쓰는 게 연례행사가 되어 버렸다. 이렇게 독서에 대한 글을 쓰면 책을 많이 읽으라는 압박을 스스로에게 하게 되는데, 이건 나에겐 아주 좋은 스트레스다.\n생각해 보면 작년도 정말 바빴는데, 올해는 2023년 보다 더 바빴다. 일도 더 많았고, 출장도 더 많았다. 그런데 참으로 신기한 게 올해 나는 더 많은 독서를 했고, 운동도 더 많이 해서, 몸과 마음과 정신이 모두 더 건강해졌다. 그래서 나는 바빠서 책을 못 읽었고, 바빠서 운동을 못 했다는 말을 믿지 않는다. 이건 내 의지의 문제이고, 할 수 있다고 하면 할 수 있고, 독서하고 운동하겠다고 계획하면 둘 다 할 수 있다.\n이전 포스팅이 현대의 창업가 정주영 씨 이야기였는데, “하면 된다.” 관련해서 이분이 했던 두 개의 명언을 여기서 소개한다:\n“무슨 일이든 할 수 있다고 생각하는 사람이 해내는 법이다. 의심하면 의심하는 만큼밖에는 못하고, 할 수 없다고 생각하면 할 수 없는 것이다.”\n“모든 일은 인간이 계획하는 데 달려 있다. 적자가 나게 계획하면 적자가 나고, 망하게 계획하면 망하는 법이다.”\n내 독서 습관은 크게 변하지 않는다. 일단 나는 더 이상 책을 구매하지 않는다. 종이책, 전자책 모두 최근 몇 년 동안 구매한 적이 없고, 빌려만 본다. 내 기본 대여 플랫폼은 우리 투자사 국민도서관이다. 여기에 없는 책은 집 근처 도서관에서 직접 빌려본다. 이 두 개를 효율적으로 잘 사용하면서 중간마다 우리 사무실 구글캠퍼스에 있는 작은 도서관에서도 책을 대여하면, 1년 365일 손에서 책이 떨어져 있는 날이 없다. 옛날 어른들이 비슷한 말을 했던 것 같은데, 항상 몸에 책을 가까이하면 여러 가지 면에서 좋다. 나는 그냥 항상 부자가 된 느낌인데, 이 느낌은 그 어떤 행위도 대체해 줄 수 없다.\n책을 읽은 후 서평은 우리 투자사 플라이북에 차곡차곡 쌓아둔다. 올해 내가 플라이북에서 별 5개를 준 나의 베스트 책들을 가장 최근에 읽은 순서로 나열하자면,\n정주영의 ‘이 땅에 태어나서’\n아이라 바이오크의 ‘품위 있는 죽음의 조건’\n무라카미 하루키의 ‘직업으로서의 소설가’\n장강명의 ‘열광금지, 에바로드’\n임경선의 ‘나 자신으로 살아가기’\n임경선의 ‘자유로울 것’\n장강명의 ‘당선, 합격, 계급’\n올리버 색스의 ‘고맙습니다’\n권민창의 ‘잘 살아라 그게 최고의 복수이다’\n김한민의 ‘아무튼, 비건’\n김하나의 ‘말하기를 말하기’\n김하나의 ‘당신과 나의 아이디어’\n세이노의 ‘세이노의 가르침’\n데이비드 재럿의 ‘이만하면 괜찮은 죽음’\n\n\n\n\n이렇게 14권이다. 62권 중 14권이면 올해 읽은 책의 22.5%에 별 5개 만점을 준건데, 너무 후하게 준 것 같다. 참고로 작년에는 읽은 책의 12%에 별 5개 만점을 줬었다. 책을 읽을수록 좋은 책을 선택할 수 있는 능력이 향상되는 건지, 아니면 내가 좋아하는 작가들의(예: 장강명, 임경선, 김하나) 책을 무의식적으로 골라서 읽다 보니 별 5개가 많이 나오는 건진 잘 모르겠지만, 계속 실험을 해봐야겠다.\n올해 읽은 책들에 특정한 패턴은 없다. 내가 좋아하는 한국 작가들의 책을 꽤 많이 읽었고, 내가 관심 있는 주제에 관한 책도 많이 읽었고, 경영과 비즈니스 관련 서적은 최대한 안 읽으려고 의식적으로 노력하고, 그냥 평범한 에세이나 소설 위주로 독서했다.\n시간을 가장 잘 활용하는 방법은 독서라고 생각한다. 한 권의 책을 5시간에 걸쳐서 읽는다는 건, 그 책을 쓴 저자의 평생의 경험과 통찰력을 단 5시간 만에 배운다는 건데, 이런 말도 안 되는 남는 장사는 어디에도 없다.\n시간이 없고 바빠서 책을 읽지 못한다는 말은 세상에서 가장 한심한 변명이다.\n내년에도 50권의 책을 읽을 것이다.",

Windows에서는 Linux와 다르게 사용자 모드와 커널 모드가 긴밀하게 결합되어 있고\n이로 인해 Windows Container 는 Host 서버의 Windows OS 버전에 따라 구동이 불가능한 경우가 생깁니다.\n \n대표적으로 Windows 10 환경에서는 Windows Server 2022 이미지의 Container를 구동하는 게 불가능합니다.\n\n\n \n실제로 Windows 10 환경에서 Windows Server 2022 이미지의 Container를 실행할 경우 아래와 같은 오류가 발생합니다.\ndocker: a Windows version 10.0.20348-based image is incompatible with a 10.0.19043 host.\n.Net Framework App을 Windows Container로 실행해 보기\n저는 아래의 조건에서 Windows Container를 실행해 보았습니다.\nHost OS : Windows 10\nContainer OS : windowsservercore-ltsc2022\n실행 Application : .net framework 4.5.2 기반의 ASP.NET Application\n \n실행 Application 만들기\n1) .net framework 4.5.2 기반의 ASP.NET Application을 생성합니다.\n\n\n2) 생성한 ASP.NET Application 이 잘 동작하는 것을 확인한 후, 게시합니다.\n\n\n \nWindows 10 Host에 Windows Server 2022 가상 컴퓨터 구축하기\n앞서 이야기드린 것처럼\nWindows 10에서는 windowsservercore-ltsc2022 이미지를 구동할 수 없습니다.\n \n이를 해결하기 위해 Hyper-V를 사용해서 Windows Server 2022 가상 컴퓨터를 구축한 뒤\n해당 가상환경 위에서 windowsservercore-ltsc2022 이미지를 container로 구동했습니다.\n \n1) windows_server_2022 평가판 ISO 다운로드합니다\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/ko-kr/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022\n2) 다운로드한 ISO와 Hyper-V를 사용해서 가상 컴퓨터를 생성합니다.\n가상 컴퓨터 설정 요약 \n\n\n\n가상 컴퓨터를 실행 후 연결하여 정상적으로 설치되었는지 확인합니다.\n\n\n3) Host 컴퓨터 가상 컴퓨터를 대상으로 중첩 가상화 설정을 추가합니다.\nSet-VMProcessor -VMName \"windows-server-2022\" -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $true\n \n4) 가상 컴퓨터에 Container 관련 Windows Feature를 추가합니다.\nInstall-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V\nInstall-WindowsFeature -Name Containers\n \n5) 가상 컴퓨터에 Windows Server 용 Docker CE를 설치합니다.\nInvoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/Windows-Containers/Main/helpful_tools/Install-DockerCE/install-docker-ce.ps1\" -o install-docker-ce.ps1\n.\\install-docker-ce.ps1\ndocker 명령어 정상 실행을 확인합니다.\n \n\n\n \n가상 컴퓨터에서 Docker 빌드하기\n1) \"실행 Application 만들기\" 단계에서 게시했던 ASP.NET Application의 결과물을 가상 컴퓨터로 이동합니다.\n2) 가상 컴퓨터에 Dockerfile을 생성합니다.\n# windowsservercore-ltsc2022 이미지에 ASP.NET 프로그램을 실행할 수 있도록 가공된 이미지를 받아옵니다.\n## 설치된 내용\n### Windows Server Core as the base OS\n### IIS 10 as Web Server\n### .NET Framework (multiple versions available)\n### .NET Extensibility for IIS\nFROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/aspnet:4.8-windowsservercore-ltsc2022\n\n# IIS의 기본 웹 루트 폴더를(/inetpub/wwwroot) 작업 디렉토리로 설정합니다.\nWORKDIR /inetpub/wwwroot\n\n# ASP.NET Application 의 게시 결과물을 현재 디렉토리에 복제합니다.\nCOPY ./{ASP.NET Application 의 게시 결과물이 존재하는 폴더}/ .\n\n# IIS 기본 포트(80번)를 외부로 노출합니다.\nEXPOSE 80\n3) Dockerfile을 사용해서 빌드합니다.\ndocker build -t my-aspnet-app .\n\n\n\n4) 빌드된 이미지를 실행합니다.\ndocker run -p 80:80 -d my-aspnet-app:latest\n \n\n\n5) 80 포트로 정상 접근 확인합니다.\n\n\n\n마치며\nWindows Container의 경우 Linux Container에 비해서는 아직 부족한 점이 있지만\n무언가의 이유로 인해 Windows에서 벗어날 수 없는 경우에는 Windows OS를 사용하면서 Container 환경으로 갈 수 있는 좋은 방법 중 하나가 될 수 있을 것으로 보입니다.\n \n예제에서는 간단하게 설명하기 위해 Dockerfile을 간소화했지만,\nWindows COM 모듈 설치나, IIS 설정, Windows registry 설정 등\nApplication 실행을 위해 필요한 작업을 미리 Dockerfile 내부에서 정의해 놓을 수 있다면\n \nWindows 개발 / 운영 환경 구축 및 관리에 필요한 리소스를 크게 단축할 수 있을 것으로 보입니다.\nWindows 개발자 분들께 도움이 되길 바라며 이만 글을 마치겠습니다.\n \n감사합니다.\n참조\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2022%2Cwindows-11\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/containerd\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/set-up-environment?tabs=dockerce\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/quick-start/building-sample-app\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/windows\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/april/containers-bringing-docker-to-windows-developers-with-windows-server-containers",

정보예요.\n\n.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n만기가 비슷한 채권들로 구성된 ETF로, 상품 만기 시 원금과 이자를 상환하는 구조의 금융상품을 말해요.\n\n채권 투자 기본 상식 알아두기\n\n채권은 정부나 공공기관, 기업이 자금을 빌리기 위해 발행하는 증서예요. 쉽게 말해, 내가 그들에게 돈을 빌려주는거죠.\n채권을 사면, 만기일에 원금과 이자를 돌려받을 수 있어요.\n하지만 주의할 점도 있습니다. 만약 채권을 발행한 곳이 파산하거나 빚을 갚지 못하는 상태(디폴트)에 빠지면, 원금과 이자를 받지 못할 위험이 있어요. 그래서 채권 발행자의 신용등급과 재무 상태를 반드시 확인해야 해요.\n안정성을 따지면 일반적으로 국채 > 은행채 > 회사채 순서로 안정적이라 평가돼요.\n채권은 만기 전에 팔 수도 있지만, 그 가격은 금리 변화와 채권 시장 수요·공급에 따라 달라질 수 있어요. 즉, 예상치 못한 손익이 생길 수도 있답니다.\n정리하면, 채권 투자 전 발행자의 신뢰성과 시장 상황을 꼼꼼히 살피는 것이 중요해요.\n\n\n\n\n개인이 채권에 직접 투자하는 건 쉽지 않습니다. 개별 채권의 신용, 듀레이션(Duration), 금리, 수수료, 과세 등 알아야 할 것이 많아 공부가 필요하기 때문이죠. 그래서 간접적으로 채권에 투자할 수 있는 채권 ETF나 채권 펀드가 등장했습니다.\n채권 투자에는 직접 투자와 간접 투자 방식이 있으며, 각 방식마다 고유한 장단점이 있습니다. 두 방식을 제대로 이해하면 자신의 투자 성향과 목표에 맞는 방법을 선택하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 아래에서 각 방식의 특징을 살펴보겠습니다.\n① 채권 직접 투자\n채권 직접 투자는 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}개인이 기업이나 정부가 발행한 채권을 직접 구매하는 방식입니다.\n\n채권 직접 투자의 장단점\n\n장점\n1) 원하는 채권 직접 선택할 수 있는 자율성\n2) 저렴한 중개 수수료\n3) 매매차익 비과세\n단점\n1) 채권 발행처의 신용 분석 필요\n2) 발행처 신용도에 따른 원금 손실 가능성\n\n\n원하는 채권을 골라 투자할 수 있다는 점에서 선택의 폭이 넓고, 중개 수수료가 저렴하다는 장점이 있습니다. 또한, 매매차익에 대해서는 세금이 부과되지 않는 점도 투자자에게 유리해요.\n하지만 단점도 있어요. 채권 발행 기업이나 기관의 신용 등급을 분석하고, 이자율, 만기 구조, 세금 구조 등을 꼼꼼히 따져야 하므로, 전문적인 지식과 경험이 요구됩니다. 게다가 발행처의 신용도가 낮으면 원금 손실 위험이 커질 수 있습니다.\n\n② 채권 간접 투자\n채권 간접 투자는 채권 ETF나 채권형 펀드를 통해 채권에 투자하는 방식입니다.\n\n채권 간접 투자의 장단점\n\n장점\n1) 전문가 관리 하에 운용되는 채권 포트폴리오\n2) 분산 투자 가능\n단점\n1) 운용 보수 발생\n2) 이자와 매매차익에 붙는 세금\n3) 만기 없는 구조로 별도의 관리 필요\n\n\n개인 투자자가 직접 분석하지 않아도 전문 운용사가 채권 포트폴리오를 관리해주기 때문에, 채권 투자에 익숙하지 않은 사람도 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다. 또한, 다양한 채권에 분산 투자할 수 있어 위험을 줄이는 데 효과적입니다.\n간접 투자 방식에는 몇 가지 알아둬야 할 점이 있어요. 우선, 운용 보수라는 비용이 발생하고, 얻는 이자와 매매차익이 모두 세금을 내야 하는 대상이에요. 또한, 채권 ETF나 채권형 펀드는 만기가 없어서 투자자가 언제 팔지 스스로 결정해야 하죠. 이때 채권의 가격 변동을 잘 살펴야 하다 보니 투자가 어려울 수 있어요.\n예를 들어, 만기가 3년인 채권 ETF라면, 이 ETF는 항상 듀레이션이 3년 정도 남은 채권들로 구성돼요. 만기가 2년 정도 남은 채권은 팔고, 다시 만기 3년 남은 채권으로 교체하는 구조입니다. 이런 식으로 채권이 계속 바뀌다 보니, 채권 만기가 끝날 때까지 기다리고 싶은 투자자에게는 헷갈릴 수 있어요. 특히, 적절한 타이밍에 팔지 못하면 손실을 볼 가능성도 있습니다.\n쉽게 말해, 만기가 고정된 일반 채권과 달리, 채권 ETF는 언제 사고팔지 전략을 세워야 해서 조금 더 복잡하다는 점을 알아두면 좋습니다.\n그래서 아예 예금처럼 만기가 있는 '.css-1swx3yz{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;font-weight:bold;}만기매칭형 채권ETF'가 등장했어요. 특정 만기일에 맞춰 채권들을 편입하여 ETF를 만든 겁니다. 만기 일자가 되면 자동으로 상장 폐지되고, 원금과 이자는 청산되어 투자자의 계좌로 들어옵니다.\n이 상품은 만기가 있다는 점에서 직접 투자와 유사하지만, 여러 채권에 분산 투자할 수 있다는 점에서 간접 투자와 비슷한 특징을 가지고 있어요. 다만, 만기매칭형 채권 ETF 역시 간접 투자 형태이기 때문에 매매차익과 이자에 대해 이자소득세(15.4%=소득세 14%+지방소득세 1.4%)가 부과되며, 운용 보수도 발생한다는 점을 유의해야 합니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}“원금 안 까먹는 만기매칭형 ETF에 '뭉칫돈'”\n(한국경제 2024.10.21)\n만기매칭형 채권 ETF는 회사채, 은행채 등 동일한 잔존만기 채권을 편입해 상품을 구성한다. 만기가 되면 해당 ETF는 상장 폐지되고 투자자는 약정된 이자와 원금을 받아 가는 구조다. 현재 국내에 상장된 만기매칭형 채권 ETF는 총 28개 종목이다.\n만기 시점은 ETF 상품명에 붙은 숫자를 통해 알 수 있다. 예를 들어 ‘25-10’은 2025년 10월 만기라는 의미다. ‘TIGER 27-04회사채(A+이상)’ ‘KODEX 25-11 회사채(A+이상)액티브’는 각각 2027년 4월, 2025년 11월이 만기인 상품이다.\n만기매칭형 채권 ETF는 예금 외에 안정적 수익을 찾는 개인투자자가 주로 투자한다. 금리 변동에 따른 채권 가격 등락 위험을 최소화할 수 있고, 여러 채권에 분산 투자하기 때문에 비슷한 신용등급의 개별 채권을 매수하는 것보다 안정적이다. 김도형 삼성자산운용 ETF컨설팅 본부장은 “미국이 기준금리 인하를 단행했으나 금리 변동성은 여전히 높다”며 “채권매매 차익을 얻기보다는 높은 이자를 받겠다는 투자자의 수요가 강해지고 있다”고 설명했다.(중략)\n\n\n자, 그렇다면 채권 만기와 내가 받을 수 있는 예상 수익률은 어떻게 알 수 있을까요?\n만기는 ETF 이름에 나와있습니다. 예를 들어 ‘Kodex 25-12 은행채(AAA)액티브’라면, 만기가 2025년 12월이고요. ‘Kodex 26-12 회사채(AA-이상)액티브’라면 만기가 2026년 12월입니다.\n내가 받을 수 있는 수익률은 해당 ETF의 운용사 홈페이지에서 확인할 수 있어요. 투자할 때 .css-mwm4ko{white-space:nowrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;-webkit-text-decoration:none!important;text-decoration:none!important;}.css-y1w6t8{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;cursor:pointer;-webkit-tap-highlight-color:transparent;white-space:nowrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;-webkit-text-decoration:none!important;text-decoration:none!important;}.css-1fhic5j{-webkit-background-clip:text;background-clip:text;-webkit-text-fill-color:transparent;background-image:var(--wiki-text-linear-gradient);}만기 예상 수익률(YTM).css-9dzhxd{margin-left:1px;vertical-align:middle;}\n\n\n\n을 먼저 확인하셔야 합니다. 마치 예금 가입하기 전에 금리 확인하는 것과 같은 거죠. YTM는 실시간으로 달라지며, 중도 매도시에 처음 봤던 YTM과 달라질 수 있어요.\n만기매칭형 채권ETF는 채권 투자의 복잡함을 줄이고, 예금처럼 만기까지 보유하고 있기만 하면 되는 금융상품입니다. 채권 투자에 관심이 있지만 여러 복잡한 요소 때문에 망설였던 분들에게는 좋은 대안이 될 수 있겠죠? 투자 전 예상 수익률(YTM)을 꼭 확인하시고, 예금처럼 쉽게 채권에 투자해 보세요.\n\n\n듀레이션(Duration): 채권의 가격이 금리 변화에 얼마나 민감한지를 보여주는 지표. 듀레이션이 길수록 금리 변화에 민감하며, 채권 가격이 크게 오르내릴 수 있어요. 투자자가 채권 직접 투자를 고려할 때 꼭 알아야 할 중요한 개념이에요.\n신용등급: 채권 발행 기관의 신용도를 평가하는 지표. 쉽게 말해, 빌린 돈을 잘 갚을 가능성이 얼마나 높은지 평가하는 기준이죠. 신용등급이 높으면 안전하지만, 이자율이 낮아요. 반면 신용등급이 낮으면 위험부담은 있지만, 그만큼 이자율이 높아집니다.\n상장폐지: 만기매칭형 채권 ETF의 만기일이 되면, ETF는 더이상 시장에서 거래되지 않게 돼요. 걱정할 필요는 없어요. 상장폐지 후 원금과 이자는 투자자 계좌로 자동 입금됩니다. 즉, 투자 기간이 끝나면 알아서 정리되는 구조예요.\n\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}– 특정 상품명을 언급한 것은 예시와 설명을 위한 목적이며, 이는 투자 권유나 종목 추천을 위한 것이 아닙니다.\n– 상기 정보는 투자 상품의 판매나 권유를 위하여 제작된 것이 아닙니다. 본 자료 중 제3자로부터 제공받은 정보의 오류 및 생략에 대하여 당사는 책임을 지지 않습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
