In future releases customers can expect to see continued acceleration towards C++23 conformance.\nNote: C++23 features can be used by either adding /std:c++latest or /std:c++23preview to the command line. In addition, features used from unfinished standards may not have full IntelliSense support.\nImplement P0330R8\nAdds a new literal suffix which enables a literal to deduce to a form of size_t.\nconstexpr auto x = 10zu; // Deduces to 'size_t'\r\nconstexpr auto y = 10z;  // Deduces to signed form of 'size_t' (i.e. 'ptrdiff_t')\nImplement P2242R3\nRelaxes constexpr restrictions around labels, goto, and non-literal user-defined types.\nconstexpr bool f() {\r\n  if (std::is_constant_evaluated()) {\r\n    return true;\r\n  }\r\n  goto label;\r\nlabel:\r\n  return false;\r\n}\r\nstatic_assert(f()); // OK - constant evaluation never reaches the 'goto' statement.\nCompiler improvements for 17.13\nThe categories below are some areas that the team has identified as high impact feature areas of the compiler toolset for customers.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We are happy to announce that Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13 is now generally available! This post summarizes the new features you can find in this release for C++. You can download Visual Studio 2022 from the Visual Studio downloads page or upgrade your existing installation by following the Update Visual Studio Learn page.\nStandard Library and Compiler\nOn the compiler side, we’ve implemented C++23’s size_t literal suffix. The suffix uz or UZ (or any permutation of these) will help you avoid sneaky truncations or signed comparison mismatches, especially when writing loops. For example:\n//Infinite loop if v.size > max unsigned int\r\nfor (auto i = 0u; i < v.size(); ++i) {\r\n    //Use v and v[i]\r\n}\r\n\r\n//Fine due to uz literal\r\nfor (auto i = 0uz; i < v.size(); ++i) {\r\n    //Use v and v[i]\r\n}\nNote that, while this feature is available in our MSVC compiler, it is not yet supported in the EDG compiler that powers IntelliSense, so you may see red squiggles in your editor until support is added.\nFor all of the compiler improvements shipped in VS 2022 17.13, see MSVC Compiler Updates in Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13.\nOur standard library has too many improvements to list in this blog post, so check out the changelog for all the details. Thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to this release! I’ve picked out some highlights below.\nThe feature I’m most excited about is std::generator. This brings some long-awaited standard library support for coroutines. A little example from the paper:\nstd::generator<int> fib() {\r\n    auto a = 0, b = 1;\r\n    while (true) {\r\n        co_yield std::exchange(a, std::exchange(b, a + b));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nint answer_to_the_universe() {\r\n    auto rng = fib() | std::views::drop(6) | std::views::take(3);\r\n    return std::ranges::fold_left(std::move(rng), 0, std::plus{});\r\n}\nThe fib function is a coroutine (because it uses the co_yield keyword). Whenever the co_yield statement is executed, fib is suspended and the value is returned to the caller. The fib coroutine can then be resumed later to produce more values, without requiring any manual state handling from the programmer. As you can see from the next function, std::generator is compatible with ranges, so we can pipe it into some range adaptors from the standard library.\nAlso in the area of conformance, we implemented two papers that improve the performance of std::print: P3107R5 and P3235R3.\nWe’ve improved the build throughput of <queue>, <stack>, <stacktrace>, and <thread> by not including all of <format>. For the same reason, we’ve moved system_clock, high_resolution_clock, and chrono_literals from a commonly-included internal header to <chrono>. This has source-breaking impact. If you see compiler errors complaining that it doesn’t recognize chrono types like system_clock or UDLs like 1729ms, you need to include <chrono> specifically, instead of assuming that headers like <thread> will drag it in.\nWe have also continued our work in improving vectorization across the standard library. This release comes with improvements for the following types and functions:\n(ranges::)find_end\nbasic_string::(r)find\nadjacent_difference\nbitset\nbasic_string::find_last_of\n(ranges::)remove\nC++ Productivity\nUnreal Engine integration updates\nWe have made a series of updates for the Unreal Engine integration in Visual Studio:\nWe added two new options in Tools > Options that allow you to specify Code Analysis with Unreal Header Tool for both header and source files. To enhance performance, analysis of source files is disabled by default.\nYou can now specify Public and Private folders when using the Add Class wizard, ensuring that your classes are created in the correct folder structure.\nIf you want to learn more about the Visual Studio support for Unreal Engine, check out our Unreal Engine Overview page.\nC++23 Preview Project Setting\nYou can now enable a preview of our C++23 implementation in Visual C++ directly from your project settings! This new setting unlocks access to the latest features we’ve implemented of the C++23 standard. As this is a preview of C++23 features, those new features will have limited support and may change in future releases.\n\nFor more details and instructions, check out our documentation.\nNew Code Generation Property Page Settings for x86 and x64\nVector Length Property: Configure vector lengths for code generation on x86 and x64 directly in your C++ project settings by going to Configuration Properties > C/C++ > Code Generation.\n\nAVX10.1 Support: Unlock the power of AVX10.1 with a new entry in Enable Enhanced Instruction Set, adding the /arch:AVX10.1 flag to your builds.\n\nCheck out the documentation for details.\nSupport for CMake Presets v9\nVisual Studio now supports CMake Presets v9. This latest version of CMake presets introduces several documented versions of macro expansions in the include field of a preset. Read more at the official CMake documentation.\nSpecify Linux timeout settings for C++\nWe have added support for specifying a minimum timeout period for your remote machines that you are connected to via the Connection Manager in Visual Studio. To learn more about adding a remote connection in Visual Studio, please see our C++ Linux documentation.\nYou can specify the timeout period in the Command Prompt in Visual Studio, using the new property MinTimeoutSeconds. For example, to set the timeout period to 1 minute, you can use the following command:\nConnectionManager modify <connection-id> --property MinTimeoutSeconds=60\nGeneral Productivity\nSet Default File Encoding\nVisual Studio now allows you to set the default file encoding for saving files. This feature ensures that your preferred encoding is used whenever possible.\nTo set the default encoding, navigate to Tools > Options > Environment > Documents. There, you will find an option titled Save files with the following encoding.\n\nHorizontal Scrollbar Visibility Improvements\nThe horizontal scrollbar in the editor now repositions itself to always be accessible, even when space is limited. You can customize this behavior with the Tools > Options > Text Editor > Advanced > Editor horizontal scrollbar location option.\n\nWord Wrap Indentation\nYou can now specify whether lines that wrap in the editor should be indented. Enable this with the Tools > Options > Text Editor > General > Automatically indent when word wrap is enabled option.\n\nRecent Files in Code Search\nWhen you open Code Search without a query, you’ll see a list of your recently navigated files. These include the files you opened through Code Search, but also any other files you opened in the solution. This makes it easy to jump back to a file you were recently working on without having to remember or type the file name.\n\nEnhanced Line and Column Navigation\nIn Code Search, we’ve significantly enhanced line navigation capabilities. The following formats are now supported:\n:line to navigate to a specific line in the active document\n:line,col to navigate to a specific line and column in the active document\nfile:line to navigate to a specific line in a specified file\nfile:line,col to navigate to a specific line and column in a specified file\nfile(line) to navigate to a specific line in a specified file\nfile(line,col) to navigate to a specific line and column in a specified file\n\nDebugging & Diagnostics\nTargeted Instrumentation\nThe Visual Studio profiler’s instrumentation tool now supports targeted instrumentation for native code, allowing you to select specific classes and functions for detailed analysis.\nTo access this tool, select Debug > Performance Profiler… > Instrumentation.\n\nColor-Coded Swim Lanes for CPU Profiling\nThe Visual Studio profiler’s CPU Usage tool now supports multi-process analysis, displaying performance graphs with distinct color coding for each process in swim lanes.\nThe graphs are displayed as stacked area charts. You also have the option to filter processes using a dropdown on the top left, enabling focused analysis.\n\nGit tooling\nAdd comments on pull requests\nYou can now add new comments to pull request files on the checked-out branch. This was a top request for the pull request experience and is the latest in a series of improvements to the pull request experience in Visual Studio.\nEnable the feature flags Pull Request Comments and Pull Request Add Comment in Tools > Options > Environment > Preview Features, check out any branch with an active pull request, and select Show comments in files in the info bar. This will activate the pull request comments experience in the editor.\n\nReview Changes with Copilot\nYou can now request a code review from GitHub Copilot from the Git Changes window.\n\nThe model will look for potential issues and create comments for them:\n\nTo use this feature, ensure you have the following feature flags turned on:\nTools > Options > Preview Features > Pull Request Comments\nTools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Source Control Integration > Enable Git preview features.\nView and Manage Git Tags\nYou can now view and manage Git tags directly from the Git Repository window.\n\nIDE\nPreserve Font Preferences Across Themes\nYour font face and size choices are now retained when switching themes in Visual Studio. The colors of your fonts remain linked to the theme.\nThis feature is enabled by default. If you prefer the previous behavior, toggle the Tools > Manage Preview Features > Separate font settings from color theme selection option.\nNew Ways to Sign In With GitHub\nYou can now sign in to your GitHub account either from the first launch configuration dialog, or the “Sign in” button in Visual Studio.\n\nManage multiple GitHub accounts\nYou can now manage multiple GitHub accounts from Visual Studio. To do so, click Add another account in either the profile card menu accessible near the window controls of Visual Studio, or in File > Account Settings. If you have multiple GitHub accounts, Visual Studio will default to the one marked as active for GitHub-aware features, such as version control and GitHub Copilot.\n\nGitHub Copilot\nGitHub Copilot Free\nGitHub Copilot Free is now available. You get 2,000 code completions and 50 chat requests per month at no cost. Go to Microsoft Learn to find out all the details.\nBetter AI code completions for C++\nGitHub Copilot code completions provide autocomplete suggestions inline as you code. To enhance the experience of C++ developers, we’ve updated GitHub Copilot to include other relevant files as context. This improvement helps reduce hallucinations while offering more relevant and accurate suggestions and is aligned with the current GitHub Copilot experience for C++ in VS Code.\nGitHub Copilot Edits for Working Across Files\nGitHub Copilot Edits is a new feature that helps make changes that touch multiple files in your project. To start a new Edits session, click the Create new edit session at the top of the GitHub Copilot Chat window:\n\nDescribe the changes you want to make, and Copilot will suggest the relevant edits. You can then preview them one-by-one and accept the ones you want or make corrections.\n\nSend us your feedback\nWe are very much interested in your feedback to continue to improve this experience. The comments below are open. Feedback can also be shared through Visual Studio Developer Community. You can also reach us via email at visualcpp@microsoft.com.\n \nThe post What’s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.13 appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "In 2024, our bug bounty program awarded more than $2.3 million in bounties, bringing our total bounties since the creation of our program in 2011 to over $20 million. \nAs part of our defense-in-depth strategy, we continued to collaborate with the security research community in the areas of GenAI, AR/VR, ads tools, and more. \nWe also celebrated the security research done by our bug bounty community as part of our annual bug bounty summit and many other industry events. \nAs we embark on a new year, we’re sharing several updates on our work with external bug bounty security researchers to help protect our global community and platforms. This includes new payout stats, details on what’s in scope for GenAI-related bug reports, and a recap of some of our engagements throughout last year with bug bounty researchers. \nHighlights from Meta’s bug bounty program in 2024\nIn 2024, we received nearly 10,000 bug reports and paid out more than $2.3 million in bounty awards to researchers around the world who helped make our platforms safer.\nSince 2011, we have paid out more than $20 million in bug bounties. \nLast year, we received nearly 10,000 reports and paid out awards on nearly 600 valid reports.\nIn 2024, we awarded more than $2.3 million to nearly 200 researchers from more than 45 countries. \nThe top three countries based on bounties awarded last year are India, Nepal, and the United States.\nEngaging researchers in bug hunting in GenAI \nAfter making our generative AI features available to security researchers through our long-running bug bounty program in 2023, Meta has continued to roll out new GenAI products and tools. In 2024, we provided more details to our research community on what’s in scope for bug bounty reports related to our large language models (LLMs). We now welcome reports that demonstrate integral privacy or security issues associated with Meta’s LLMs, including being able to extract training data through tactics like model inversion or extraction attacks. \nWe have already received several impactful reports focused on our GenAI tools, and we look forward to continuing this important work with our community of researchers to help ensure the security and integrity of our GenAI tools.\nEncouraging security research in ads audience and hardware products \nThis year, we prioritized our efforts to steer security research by the bug bounty community towards a number of product surfaces, including:\nAds audience tools designed to help people choose a target audience for their ads: We introduced new payout guidelines to provide transparency to our security researchers on how we assess the impact of the report we receive for potential security bugs in Meta’s ads audience tools. We cap the maximum base payout for discovering PII (name, email, phone number, state, ZIP, gender) for an ads audience at $30,000 and then apply any applicable deduction based on the required user interaction, prerequisites, and any other mitigation factors to arrive at the final awarded bounty amount. More details here.\nMixed reality hardware products: As Meta continues to roll out mixed reality products, we work to encourage security research into these hardware and AI-driven technologies to help us find and fix potential bugs as quickly as possible. In 2024, our bug bounty researchers contributed reports on potential issues in Quest that could have impacted safety settings or lead to memory corruption. We also brought our Quest 3 and Ray-Ban Meta glasses to hardwear.io USA 2024, a leading conference that brings together top hardware hackers to test new hardware products and help uncover potential vulnerabilities. \nBuilding and celebrating the global bug bounty community\nAs part of our continuous commitment to security research – both inside and outside Meta – we  invested in enabling open collaboration with our bug bounty community by:\nOrganizing community events and presenting joint research: We hosted our annual Meta Bug Bounty Researcher Conference (MBBRC) in Johannesburg, South Africa, bringing together 60 of our top researchers from all over the world. We received more than 100 bug reports and awarded over $320,000 in total.  We also co-presented talks at EkoParty, DEF CON, Hardwear.io, Pwn2own, and other security research summits. This year, we’re pleased to share that 2025 MBBRC will be hosted in Tokyo, Japan May 12-15. Stay tuned for more details in 2025.\nCelebrating long-time researchers: One of our most long-standing and prolific researchers, Philippe Harewood, reached a 10-year milestone with over 500 valid reports paid out by our bug bounty program. Noteworthy contributions over the years include Philippe’s groundbreaking research on Instagram access token leak, video capture limit bypass on Ray-Ban stories, and more. \nProviding resources and timely updates for the research community: The Meta Bug Bounty website serves as a centralized hub for all bug bounty news and updates. Researchers can also follow the program on Instagram, Facebook, and X, for quick updates. \nLooking ahead\nMeta’s bug bounty team looks forward to introducing new initiatives and continuing to engage with our existing community and new researchers who are just getting started. Additionally, we will continue to provide seasoned experts with unique opportunities to test unreleased features through our private bug bounty tracks.\nFor the past 14 years, our bug bounty program has fostered a collaborative relationship with external researchers that has helped keep our platforms safer and more secure. We would like to extend a heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to the growth of our program in 2024.\nThe post Looking back at our Bug Bounty program in 2024 appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Ktor 3.1.0 is here! This is the first minor release of the year, bringing exciting new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. This release includes improvements to server-sent events (SSE), documentation enhancements, WebAssembly (Wasm) support, dependency injection design updates, and some initial steps toward gRPC integration.\n🚀 Get started with Ktor 3.1.0 now!\nReady to explore Ktor 3.1.0? Start building your next project today with our interactive project generator at start.ktor.io. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome!\n🔗 Get Started With Ktor | 📢 Join the Community on Reddit and Slack\nRelease notes\nKtor CLI: A new tool to create Ktor projects\nWe’re introducing a new command-line tool designed to simplify the creation of Ktor projects. It provides an easy-to-use interface for generating project templates with your preferred features, reducing boilerplate and setup times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstallation\nMacOS and Linux (with Homebrew https://brew.sh/)\nbrew install ktor\n– Windows (with Winget):\nwinget install --id=JetBrains.KtorCLI -e\nHow to create a project\nTo start a new project, simply run:\nktor new\nThis command opens interactive mode, allowing you to select plugins and configure your project based on the same options available at (start.ktor.io).\nFor the non-interactive mode, run ktor --help to see the available options.\nContributing\nKtor CLI is open source! Share your feedback and contribute at https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-cli.\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-3808.\nSSE improvements: Serialization, reconnection, heartbeat\nServer-sent events (SSE) support has been enhanced with built-in serialization for both the client and server side. The feature allows clients and servers to handle SSE streams with automatic (de)serialization. Users simply provide a deserialize function to convert incoming data into typed objects as follows:\nClient-side SSE with deserialization\nclient.sse({\n     url(\"http://localhost:8080/serverSentEvents\")\n }, deserialize = { typeInfo, jsonString ->\n     val serializer = Json.serializersModule.serializer(typeInfo.kotlinType!!)\n     Json.decodeFromString(serializer, jsonString)!!\n }) {\n     incoming.collect { event: TypedServerSentEvent<String> ->\n         when (event.event) {\n            \"customer\" -> {\n                val customer: Customer? = deserialize<Customer>(event.data)\n            }\n            \"product\" -> {\n                 val product: Product? = deserialize<Product>(event.data)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nServer-side SSE with serialization\nrouting {\n     sse(\"/json\", serialize = { typeInfo, it ->\n         val serializer = Json.serializersModule.serializer(typeInfo.kotlinType!!)\n         Json.encodeToString(serializer, it)\n     }) {\n         send(Customer(0, \"Jet\", \"Brains\"))\n         send(Product(0, listOf(100, 200)))\n     }\n }\nThese improvements simplify working with structured SSE data in Ktor.\nSSE Heartbeat\nServer-sent events (SSE) now include the ability to specify a heartbeat event to keep the session active. The heartbeat will send a specified event at a defined interval as long as the session remains active. This helps maintain the connection during idle periods.\nrouting {\n    sse {\n        heartbeat {\n            period = 10.seconds\n            event = ServerSentEvent(\"heartbeat\")\n        }\n       //  ...\n    }\n}\nSSE reconnect\nStarting from 3.1.0, you can enable the server-sent events (SSE) reconnection feature by setting the maxReconnectionAttempts property to a value greater than zero:\ninstall(SSE) {\n    maxReconnectionAttempts = 4\n    reconnectionTime = 2.seconds\n}\nIf the connection to the server is lost, the client will wait for the specified reconnectionTime before attempting to reconnect, making no more than maxReconnectionAttempts attempts to reestablish the connection.\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-7435, KTOR-6242, KTOR-7954\nSupport multipart with HttpClient\nKtor’s HttpClient now includes improved support for multipart requests, making it easier to upload files and handle complex request bodies across different engines.\nIt is now possible to receive MultiPartData with the HttpClient:\nval response = client.post(\"https://myserver.com/multipart/receive\")\n\nval multipart = response.body<MultiPartData>()\n\nmultipart.forEachPart { part ->\n    when (part) {\n        is PartData.FormItem -> {\n            println(\"Form item key: \\${part.name}\")\n            val value = part.value\n            // ...\n        }\n        is PartData.FileItem -> {\n            println(\"file: \\${part.name}\")\n            println(part.originalFileName)\n            val fileContent: ByteReadChannel = part.provider()\n            // ...\n        }\n    }\n    part.dispose()\n}\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-6632\nAPI and docs improvements process\nWe are constantly working on polishing the quality of the API and its associated documentation. We understand that reporting problems may be challenging, so to simplify this process, we introduced the Report a Problem link for every API symbol available both in the IDE’s help section and on api.ktor.io.\n\n\n\n\nThis button will lead you to the anonymous feedback form (https://ktor.io/feedback/), allowing you to provide API-specific feedback or report a bug. Your feedback will be logged as an issue and addressed in future releases.\nDocumentation is a key part of Ktor, and we’ve introduced a structured API docs improvement process to ensure better clarity, consistency, and usability for developers.\nCompression plugin can be disabled for a specific request\nThe Compression plugin compresses responses if the client supports it. However, sometimes compression needs to be suppressed (e.g. for proxying or storing compressed content).\nPreviously, options were available for compression but not for decompression. Now, we’ve added helpers and flags for finer control:\nfun Application.module() {\n    install(Compression)\n    routing {\n        get(\"/endpoint-without-compression\") {\n            // Prevent response body compression\n            call.suppressCompression() \n            println(call.isDecompressionSuppressed)\n            // Prevent request body decompression\n            call.suppressDecompression() \n            println(call.isCompressionSuppressed) // true\n        }\n    }\n}\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-7679\nCIO: Add wasm-js and js targets for the CIO server, client, and network API\nThe CIO has been expanded to support wasm-js and js targets for both the server and client side. This makes CIO the first server-side JavaScript engine for Ktor, enabling the running of Ktor-based servers directly in JavaScript environments.\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-865, KTOR-7675, KTOR-6004\nFurther improvements and bug fixes for kotlinx-io integration\nThe integration with the kotlinx-io continues to be refined, improving performance, memory usage, and closer interactions across Ktor async io implementations. We have also added a new API extension to convert between kotlinx-io and Ktor and Java io primitives.\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-7327\nAdd Unix Domain Socket support for native targets\nKtor now supports Unix Domain Sockets on native targets, enabling inter-process communication (IPC) without relying on TCP.\nHere’s how to create a simple echo server using Unix Domain Sockets:\nfun main() {\n    val socketPath = \"ktor-echo-test.sock\"\n    val server = aSocket(ActorSelectorManager(Dispatchers.IO)).tcp().bind(UnixSocketAddress(socketPath))\n\n    println(\"Server is listening on $socketPath\")\n\n    GlobalScope.launch {\n        val connection = server.accept()\n        val input = connection.openReadChannel()\n        val output = connection.openWriteChannel(autoFlush = true)\n\n        val message = input.readUTF8Line()\n        println(\"Received: $message\")\n        output.writeStringUtf8(\"Echo: $message\")\n\n        connection.close()\n    }\n\n    val client = aSocket(ActorSelectorManager(Dispatchers.IO)).tcp().connect(UnixSocketAddress(socketPath))\n    val clientOutput = client.openWriteChannel(autoFlush = true)\n    clientOutput.writeStringUtf8(\"Hello, Unix Socket!\")\n\n    val clientInput = client.openReadChannel()\n    println(clientInput.readUTF8Line())\n\n    client.close()\n    server.close()\n\n}\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-6960\nCurl client engine: Static linking, ARM support, WebSockets\nStarting from Ktor 3.1.0, the Curl client engine is statically linked, eliminating the need to install third-party dependencies. This makes it easier to use Curl-based networking. Additionally, ARM architecture support has been added, including for macOS.\nFind more information on YouTrack: KTOR-5199\nWelcome Ktor Library Improvement Proposals (KLIP📎)\nWe’re happy to introduce Ktor Library Improvement Proposals (KLIP) – an open initiative for the community to propose, discuss, and collaborate on new features and improvements for Ktor. The KLIP process is designed to make Ktor’s evolution transparent and community-driven. The KLIP repository is open for contributions, and we welcome everyone to participate in discussions or submit new proposals. Approved KLIPs are merged into the repository and will be implemented in the framework by the team.\nThe first 📎 dependency injection is available for review and feedback: https://github.com/ktorio/ktor-klip/pull/1\nLooking forward to gRPC support with kotlinx-rpc\nThe basic support of the gRPC has been added to kotlinx-rpc 0.5.0: https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx-rpc/grpc-configuration.html#dependencies-configuration. This moves the highly requested KTOR-1501 proposal forward. We’re planning further Ktor integration with gRPC, along with a plugin for start.ktor.io in future releases. This will help to simplify the setup and use of gRPC in Ktor applications.\nMCP: Exposing and consuming APIs for LLMs\nIn preparation for Ktor 3.1.0, we’ve been helping to build the MCP Kotlin SDK (https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/kotlin-sdk). This lightweight SDK enables integration between your applications and large language models (LLMs), allowing you to expose your APIs to language models and agents or build clients connecting multiple applications with LLMs. The library is already published on MavenCentral.\n🚀 Thank you!\nWe want to say thank you to everyone for all the contributions and feedback you provide!\nWe especially want to mention the following active contributors: anton-erofeev, FredrikMeyer, IRus, whyoleg, SIMULATAN, Thomas-Vos, and adriandieter.\nStart building your next project with start.ktor.io.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Development Lead in Kotlin Compiler, Simon Ogorodnik. \n\n\n\nThe competitive nature of today’s digital business environment makes it critical for software development teams to embrace change, especially if it leads to improved software quality and efficiency. As a manager or team lead, your leadership plays a role in guiding your team through these metamorphoses.\nAt Qodana, we’re all about code quality and security for teams, so in this installment of our Leadership Series, we will explore the intricacies of implementing new tools that can help with this. We will also look at how to overcome the professional challenges that come with process improvement and managing change. \nJoining us to share their insights are Team Lead in Kotlin Build Infrastructure Nikolay Krasko and Development Lead in Kotlin Compiler Simon Ogorodnik. \nImportance of quality and process improvement\nThe first step in driving quality improvement is recognizing the significance of creating superior products or services. Quality boosts customer satisfaction, enhances your company’s reputation, and gives your business a competitive edge. Similarly, well-defined processes lead to increased efficiency and productivity, paving the way for superior performance and growth.\nAccording to the MIT Sloan Management Review, “Having fewer defects or field failures results in lower manufacturing and service costs. As long as these gains exceed any increase in expenditures by the firm on defect prevention, profitability will improve.”\nHowever, process management, new tools, and changes are often required to achieve better quality, and software development teams are not always open to change. \nDefining and identifying the problem\nAs an example, take a look at this Reddit post and its upvotes to see how championing new tools and emphasizing code quality can be a challenge. \nProblem example.  \n\n\n\nHow can this developer, and others, address this? \n“I would say that it depends a lot on their code review practice. Do they have to fix review suggestions before merging, for example? It also depends on the type of project that they are working on. But if they are trying to raise the bar here, I would first talk with the team lead or tech lead to acknowledge the problem and find a solution. These discussions can also be had in the reviews, not just in the comments,” says Development Lead in Kotlin Compiler, Simon Ogorodnik. \n“If the team, team lead, tech lead, architect, and CTO don’t care, then it will be nearly impossible – but if they do, there’s room to start the conversation with the team.” \nKotlin’s experience\n“We’ve always cared about code quality, but one of the first challenges we faced was getting enough data to make an educated decision about which tools to integrate into our stack. We identified the problem that we weren’t working as a team and needed stricter quality rules, but then we needed to gather information from different stakeholders, team leads, and developers. Understandably, our team needed to see a lot of value in a solution in order to advocate for it – and this can be a major hurdle,” says Simon. \n“You can’t measure something you don’t understand in detail because once you have asserted there’s a problem, there are many potential solutions. You need to be able to summarize, view, and present data on why this change will fix something and not introduce unnecessary problems,” adds Team Lead in Kotlin Build Infrastructure, Nikolay Krasko. \n“First, identify the problem, the fears, and the concerns. Then come the hard questions like if it’s really a problem or whether there are key people who aren’t on board. Does everyone agree it’s the highest priority problem? Often they don’t. Then we have to say, ‘I have this solution. Can you explain why you don’t like it, and do you see other solutions?’ In the end, you either get a better solution or points that challenge your beliefs.” \nHowever, these conversations can also be difficult. With this in mind, the first step is to provide comprehensive data to your team to open the discussion and start generating internal buy-in. However, this works on the assumption that you have already made an autonomous decision or have a bias. \nQuestion your own biases and assumptions\nThis is another important part of introducing a change, with the help of your team. \n“You should avoid an authoritarian style,” says Simon when asked about what happens when teammates don’t agree, “It works to make a change in the short term, but you still need to provide some reasoning. Saying ‘We hired an external auditor who said our practice is bad, so now we are getting a new tool’ won’t cut it. People won’t buy into things just because you tell them to.” \n“It would be easier if there is one decision-maker who’s going to say, ‘I know what I’m doing, I’ve got this, let’s go.’ But we need to convince a lot of people sometimes and this is hard,” says Nikolay, also erring towards a more evidence-based decision-making style. \n“Saying ‘We hired an external auditor who said our practice is bad, so now we are getting a new tool’ isn’t a good idea.”\nEmbracing new technology with an open mind\nIt’s clear that change is often met with resistance, but as a leader, your role is to turn this challenge into an opportunity. Successful change management requires clear communication, employee involvement, effective training, time management, and patience. Taking these steps reduces anxiety, fosters open dialogue, and encourages employee buy-in and new perspectives. \nHow do you deal with detractors and those against proposed changes?\nAn important point to consider is that teammates with opposing views are not necessarily wrong. This is not a revolutionary concept, but sometimes leaders must check their egos to gather useful information that could benefit them in the long term. That said, stakeholders can typically be divided into supporters and detractors – and both groups have something valuable to offer. \n“Speak to people who don’t like the change,” says Nikolay, “you might identify a misunderstanding. Perhaps it’s not the tool or the change they are opposed to, but maybe they are scared of doing more work or losing their position. By opening up the floor to these perspectives, you can get to the root reasons for the resistance. \nMaybe someone will tell me, ‘I don’t want it because it promotes architectural patterns I don’t like,’ but the core fear is additional tasks or complexity, or becoming redundant themselves.” \nOn the other hand, both Nikolay and Simon agree that it is important to share the perspectives of supporters. “I’m not going to talk only with people who are against it, but I also want to understand those who are for the change. There will be some who are strictly pro. \nUsing Qodana as an example, maybe they came from another company where they had static analysis tools, and they used Qodana and liked it. This will help to share the vision and convert people who are neutral one way or the other,” says Simon. \nGuiding your team through the implementation of quality processes\nTransforming your team’s way of working comes with challenges, but a leader guides, not dictates. Let your team in on why these changes are happening and how they can contribute to the overall success and quality improvement.\n“With stakeholder management, you can’t always ask everybody,” says Simon, “It would be great, but it wouldn’t work in the scope of 100 people, for example. For that, I would try to gather a representative working group of people who will be stakeholders or those with strong opinions.”\nTeam Lead in Kotlin Build Infrastructure Nikolay Krasko. \n\n\n\nNikolay adds, “For smaller teams, it’s not a big deal to just talk with everybody. Bring it up in a team meeting and say okay, here it is. We have our quality level and our number of regressions. Maybe the QA team will be happy about that. \nIt would be nice to detect problems automatically and for your tech lead to say, ‘We are not going to push those strange patterns into production anymore. I need those static checkers so I can stop constantly mentioning the same issues during the code review. I’m tired and want to free myself from that.’ Choose people who have strong opinions and authority.” \nIn summary:\nExplain clearly why changes are necessary and how they can improve quality and efficiency. \nSeek your team’s input during the decision-making process and make them feel involved. \nOffer training that will equip your team with the necessary skills and knowledge to adapt to new quality processes.\nRegularly track your progress using key performance indicators (KPIs) to identify what’s working and what could be improved.\nCelebrate small victories along the way and acknowledge those who are driving the change.\nThere is also another important point: Ease the burden of change with small, incremental adjustments. \n“If it’s a gradual change and initial processes aren’t deeply affected, it may be a better strategy to introduce it in stages. You don’t need to uproot everything before you get some traction and adoption. Do this gradually and you’ll have a new baseline and support from your team members who enjoy it. This is one of the most natural ways to introduce any new technology,” says Nikolay.\n“I think that way of managing change should be an industry standard,” Simon adds, “If you’ve read Leading Change, it will tell you similar things. I presume that at least for most large companies, it’s the default way of doing things. It’s the same values that Agile and chaos engineering promote.”\n“If it’s a gradual change and initial processes aren’t deeply affected, it may be a better strategy to introduce it in stages. You don’t need to uproot everything before you get some traction and adoption.”\nLeading quality improvement \nImproving quality and refining processes in your organization is neither a quick nor solitary task but one that requires collective effort, patience, and strong leadership. As a leader, your attitude towards change will significantly influence how your team adapts. Keep communication transparent, involve your team in decision-making, and remember to acknowledge their efforts – it’s these subtle actions that make a big difference. \nQuality improvements and process upgrades are vital for business success, and with effective leadership and a committed team, your quality upgrade will not only be possible but will also become a key driver of your future growth.\nFinal words on managing conflict\nFrom Simon: “Don’t take change management as a black-and-white thing. You’re going to end up in a gray area, you’re going to implement it halfway, and you can sell it like that as well. You can say, ‘Let’s just give it a try and see how it goes, and if it doesn’t work, let’s try again and try something else,’ so that people don’t feel like it’s so extreme. It’s an iterative process.”\nFrom Nikolay: “In general, speak to business goals. People usually understand this, as they are a strong motivator, and if it’s justified by data, it can be a powerful driver for change. \nNothing works exactly as it’s intended. You will always find flaws and bugs, and you need to adjust. It’s better to anticipate the evolution process right from the beginning to make it easier to commit to changes.” \nTell us what you’d like to see\nThanks for joining us for the Qodana Leadership Series, which aims to create discussions about real-world problems facing quality-focused leaders in software development and AI.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Did you know? The GC.KeepAlive() method in the .NET Framework is not used to prevent garbage collection of an object for the entire method scope, as you might think. Instead, it explicitly ensures that the object remains referenced at a specific point in the code after it’s last used. It’s particularly useful when dealing with unmanaged code or resources where the runtime might release an object too early because no managed references exist for it.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! This newsletter is the home for recent .NET and software development related information.\n🌟 Featured Content\nThis month’s Featured Content is from Daniel Ward. Daniel is a Microsoft .NET MVP and software consultant at Lean TECHniques. He helps teams deliver high-quality software while adopting lean practices such as effective CI/CD, automated testing, and product management. He co-organizes the San Antonio/Austin .NET User Group and also writes a technical blog. Outside of work, he enjoys playing piano and guitar, swing dancing, and game development.\nAre your tests actually catching bugs?\nHaving a strong test suite is an important (and necessary, I would argue) part of creating high quality software that’s adaptable to changes. Once you’ve written those tests, though, how do you know they’re actually catching bugs? “Never trust a test you haven’t seen fail” is a great guideline for writing new tests, but what about after that?\nThis is where mutation testing comes in. Simply put, mutation testing is a way to test your tests. In my experience, it’s not a very common strategy among developers – including myself! Before I learned about it, I already felt confident in the way I wrote tests, and didn’t want to yet invest the time to learn another testing framework and philosophy. However, once I understood what mutation testing is, and how easy it is to adopt, I became a big supporter of it.\nTesting your tests\nTo see how simple mutation testing really is, try this: go into one of your projects and change a + operator to a – operator and see if the tests around that code still pass. If they do, that means your tests probably aren’t as amazing as they could be. Congratulations, you’ve just done mutation testing!\nOf course, manually changing your code over and over like this would be very painful and time consuming, and this is what mutation testing libraries are for. Stryker, one of those libraries, is a popular option for C# and Typescript. Stryker can help you scale this process by automating it, discovering many mutants all at once and then seeing if your tests fail.\nMutation testing concepts\nThe core concept is simple:\nYou create “mutants,” which are small changes to your code. The operator change in the example above is an example of a mutant.\nThen, you try to “kill” those mutants. You do this by running the tests that hit the changed code.\n If your tests fail (which they should, because your code is now doing something fundamentally different), then you’ve killed the mutant! Otherwise, the mutant has survived, and you probably need to update your test cases.\nAt the end of the run, you’re given a “mutation score” of 0-100%. This is the number of mutants that were killed compared to the total that were found. Just like with code coverage, a higher number is better.\nGetting started\nOne of the great things about getting started with mutation testing is that you don’t necessarily need to enforce it. Rather than fail the build on a low mutation score, your team may decide to just use it as a soft metric to identify weak tests. Or, you may choose to just run Stryker locally. You’ll be able to improve the quality of your tests over time, and your team won’t even know that you’re using Stryker – you’ll just end up with better quality tests as a result! Not only that, but you’ll start to get a feel for what does make a strong test case and hopefully create less mutants in the future. In this way, Stryker can also be a great learning tool for creating high quality tests.\nHowever you choose to use it, mutation testing is a low effort way to get a lot of value out of your test suite, and I encourage you to try it out.If you’d like to have a practical code example and see Stryker in action, I’ve previously written about mutation testing with Stryker in C# at my blog, and also given a talk on it, which can be found on Youtube.\n🔗 Links\nHere’s the latest from the developer community.\nTechnical Coaching: METRICS Your Developer BOSS Cares About – Emily Bache\nFrom Zero to Hero: JetBrains Rider – Dan Clark\nHow to FIX a Spaghetti Code System – Derek Comartin\nASP.NET Core Reimagined with htmx Book and Query Projection: Stop Hauling More Data Than You Need! – Chris Woodruff\nHow to Integration Test with the new .NET Testing Framework – Gui Ferreira\nEverything a .NET Developer Needs to Know in 2025 – Nick Chapsas\nWhy I Use Visual Studio & ReSharper for C++ – Utah Cpp Programmers\nExploring the Forwarded Headers Middleware in ASP.NET Core – Tore Nestenius\nHow to Add, Edit, or Remove Hyperlinks in PDFs Using C#? – Chinnu Muniyappan\nDeploying ASP.NET Core Applications with Docker—Part 1 and Deploying ASP.NET Core Applications with Docker—Part 2– Assis Zang\n Func vs. Predicate vs. Expression in C# .Net – Jiyan Epözdemir\nEvaluating the Parallel Processing of Collections in Microsoft .NET – David McCarter\n.NET Asynchronous Programming Guidance – David Fowler\nASP.NET Core Distributed Tracing – Ricardo Peres\nMastering C# – Pattern Matching – Jesse Liberty\nC# Enum: Definition and Best Practices – Stackify Team\nAI chatbots vs. AI agents: Which AI tool fits your business needs? – Emily Shin\nImproving your dev experience with .NET Aspire – Chris Klug at NDC Porto 2024\nUsing Roslyn to analyze and rewrite code in a solution – Gérald Barré\nWhy Tracebit is written in C# – Sam Cox\n🔦 From our .NET Guide\nEach month we feature tutorials or tips from our .NET Guide.\nIn this tutorial, we will have a look at profiling options in Rider.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hey, I’m Anton, product manager at JetBrains AI, and I managed training and release of the JetBrains’ first proprietary LLM. 👋\nLast year, we launched Mellum, a project I’m incredibly proud of. Mellum isn’t just another LLM – it’s a reflection of JetBrains’ commitment to helping developers work smarter and more efficiently. Today I’d like to share the behind-the-scenes story of building Mellum and hurdles I wish we knew how to properly handle.\nWhy did we build a proprietary LLM? And why just for code completion?\nLet’s start with the big question – why Mellum? We wanted to create something that truly understands and supports developers. \nGeneral-purpose AI models, while impressive and powerful, often miss the mark when it comes to specific tasks like code completion. They’re big, at times slow, and designed for everything, so they may lack precision and relevance. That’s where Mellum comes in.\nThen why just for code completion? \nAt JetBrains, we had already developed expertise in training smaller models for code completion. So, launching Mellum was a natural progression for us. While the scope of tasks remained limited, Mellum focused on delivering the most critical features that every modern, AI-powered assistant should offer. It was not easy though! The model’s larger size brought new technical challenges, pushing us to expand our capabilities.\nWe built Mellum to:\nMake our AI-driven code completion feature excel. Mellum is laser-focused on providing fast, accurate code completions. It’s not trying to solve every problem under the sun – it’s built to be great at one specific task that is really fundamental to development.\nExpand JetBrains’ expertise in AI. Building Mellum wasn’t just about the immediate benefits, it was also about gaining the skills and infrastructure to tackle future challenges and make JetBrains’ products even better.\nThe challenges we faced while training the LLM\nDeveloping Mellum was no walk in the park. One of the biggest hurdles was training Mellum on massive datasets using GPU clusters – an entirely new frontier for JetBrains. Navigating this territory required overcoming a steep learning curve, adopting new technologies, and refining our processes to meet the demands of large-scale model training. \nHere are some of the key challenges we tackled:\nTraining models at scale\nWe moved from training small models on single servers to distributed training across huge GPU clusters. This shift involved setting up the infrastructure, adopting new technologies in the company, navigating the complex process of vendor selection, and building a trusting business relationship with the cluster provider.\nWorking with data\nGood data is everything when training an AI model. For Mellum, we processed vast amounts of code to ensure consistency and relevance while remaining attentive to legal compliance. \nIn addition to using well-known evaluation metrics, we enhanced them to better reflect real-world developer scenarios. We also applied our evaluation process at scale, enabling us to measure quality across a diverse range of code examples.\nBalancing quality and speed\nDeveloping an LLM for real-world product use inevitably involves navigating the tradeoff between quality and performance. On the one hand, larger models tend to produce better outputs. On the other, they come with increased costs and slower performance. For code completion tasks, this trade-off has a huge impact – if a code completion tool is slow, it’s unusable. At JetBrains, we are aiming to build sustainable products, so finding the sweet spot was a crucial goal for us.\nWhat could we have done differently?\nThis ride wasn’t all unicorns and rainbows, and we definitely made some mistakes along the way. If I were able to travel back in time and tackle this project again, I’d do the following things differently:\nMaking key technical decisions earlier. Developing a demanding feature like AI-driven code completion involves extensive R&D, requiring significant trial and error to solve specific challenges and enhance quality. Having a clearer understanding of the most effective approaches from the start would have allowed us to move much faster and achieve even better results.\nEmbracing a larger cluster size sooner. When we first started training Mellum, our cluster was four times smaller than the one we were using when Mellum was released. Had we possessed deeper expertise in LLM training from the outset, we could have experimented at a faster pace. Moreover, by anticipating our larger hardware needs earlier, we could have negotiated a more favorable pricing model with our providers.\nDesigning client-server architecture better. While it’s crucial to invest time in designing a complex project, the fast-paced nature of developing AI-driven features means that users are constantly coming up with new input, making it nearly impossible to anticipate everything in advance. With the knowledge we have now, we could have designed the client-server interaction to be even more effective, ensuring greater quality.\nWhat makes Mellum special\nMellum’s edge lies in its meticulous handling of data. The way we process and format data, ensuring consistency during both the training and application phases, sets it apart. This approach guarantees that the model receives data in the exact structure it was trained on, overcoming a significant technical challenge. This precision is a key reason why Mellum performs so effectively and reliably.\nAI Assistant users have been benefiting from our custom LLM since the 2024.2 release, and there’s a mind-blowing difference between the code completion results from our model versus third-party models. 👇\nCheck the blogpost\n                                    \nWhile Mellum excels in code-specific tasks, it’s not a replacement for general-purpose LLMs. Broader models may be better suited for tasks that go beyond coding, such as drafting documentation or addressing open-ended queries. We believe that Mellum works best when used alongside other tools, giving developers the flexibility to choose what fits their needs.\nWhere we’re headed\nJetBrains has always been about empowering developers, and Mellum is a big part of that. Moving forward, we’re going to expand Mellum’s scope and add other features that might go beyond code-to-code tasks.\nA call for your feedback in the comments \nIf you’ve used code completion in AI Assistant since August, you’ve experienced Mellum in action. I’d love to hear your thoughts or any feedback on the quality. Also, what code completion qualities do you value most? Feel free to share your thoughts!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "A couple of years ago, we initiated the idea of creating a Kotlin Multiplatform IDE to help facilitate the development of KMP applications. We embarked on this venture, building on the Fleet platform, with the intention of releasing it as a standalone IDE.\nDuring this time, we have received feedback from our customers, specifically those using KMP, that they would like to see similar features and support for KMP on the IntelliJ Platform, in other words, both in IntelliJ IDEA and Android Studio. These requests have only increased in light of Google’s official support of KMP on Android.\nIn the past year, we’ve also observed significant advances in terms of approaches to application development, an area that we at JetBrains are also heavily investing in. Just recently, we announced a new coding agent named Junie.\nThese changes, as well as a desire to support our existing users on the IntelliJ Platform, require us to change our focus. That is why, moving forward, we will be focusing exclusively on providing better KMP support on the IntelliJ Platform – the specifics of what and how we’ll provide at a later date. As regards Fleet support, we will be deprecating our support for KMP in Fleet in the next three months and will no longer be releasing a standalone IDE for KMP.\nWhile this is a change of direction, we strongly believe that ultimately, we need to make sure that we are delivering not only what our users want, but also continuing to drive advancement in the software development industry, leveraging the latest tech innovations that enhance the developer experience and open up new opportunities. At JetBrains, we have built an entire technology ecosystem on top of Kotlin, including KMP, Ktor, Exposed, Amper, and the many libraries we offer. All of this, combined with the vast amounts of libraries and frameworks that the community has created, gives us a tremendous opportunity to offer an end-to-end experience for software developers with exceptional tooling that can leverage new advances in AI.\nWe would like to thank all of the many users who tried the early versions of the KMP tooling in Fleet and the tremendous amount of feedback you provided us. Please rest assured that this feedback was not given in vain. Much of what we have accomplished so far will be leveraged in our tooling efforts moving forward.\nWe very much appreciate all your support, and we are committed to providing you with a great experience using our technologies.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As Visual Studio transitions its core packages and services to an async loading/retrieval model, we’ve identified bugs in both the initial async implementation and the existing synchronous package loading mechanism.\nWhile most of these bug fixes have been transparent to extenders, one requires attention due to changed constraints. This post highlights that change. Note that this is only applicable to VSSDK based extensions and does not apply to VisualStudio.Extensiblity. For more information on the differences between extensibility models in Visual Studio, please refer to this documentation: Choose the right Visual Studio extensibility model for you – Visual Studio (Windows) | Microsoft Learn\nSummary\nThe change prevents cyclical package load requests to avoid a race condition where service requests, which should never return null, may occasionally do so. Cyclical package loads were never recommended, and any previous success was due to design decisions made over 25 years ago when Visual Studio was primarily single-threaded, and package loads had to occur on the UI thread.\nIf you trigger a cyclical package load request it will fail with an HRESULT of 0x80049283 (VS_E_CYCLICPACKAGELOAD). For managed callers this would surface as a COMException with that HRESULT, for native callers the HRESULT would be returned directly.\nThe change occurred in 17.12 Preview 2 (version 17.12.35309.182) and is present in all subsequent previews and releases.\nBackground Context\nService Discovery 101\nIn Visual Studio, a service is tied to a package. When the service is requested, the package loads (if not already loaded) and registers a service factory (IServiceProvider) to retrieve the service instance.\nTypically, service factories are registered in the package’s Initialize(Async) method (or SetSite for native packages).\nThe service retrieval path in Visual Studio works as follows:\nCaller A asks for Service B\nThe service manager checks if a service factory for Service B is already registered. If so, it invokes the factory and returns the result.\nIf no factory is registered, it checks if the package providing the service factory is loaded. If loaded, the request fails, as the service cannot be acquired.\nIf the package is not loaded, it loads the package, expecting it to register the service factory, and checks again for registration.\nIf no factory is registered, the request fails.\nIf a factory is registered, it is invoked to retrieve the service instance.\nThe Problem\nThe issue arises when a recursive package load is required.\nSo, for example, if Package A is currently loading and it calls GetService to get a service it itself provides. This creates a loop in the package load request chain as A is loading and has entered a code path, that to complete, must wait for A to finish loading.\nAnother example would be if Package A is currently loading and calls GetService on a service that comes from Package B. If Package B, during its load, calls GetService on a service that comes from package A we again have a loop in the package load request chain.\nThese loops can be arbitrarily long (i.e. Package A triggers Package B to load, which triggers package C to load, which triggers package D to load …. which triggers Package A to load).\nIf a service being requested during a package load from a package that is currently loading then:\nIf the package has registered the service factory before the request is made, the service manager invokes the factory and returns the service—this is the ideal path.\nIf the package has not registered the service factory before the request is made, a problem occurs. When the service manager checks if the package is loaded, it detects the package is still loading (not fully loaded). If it blocks waiting for the package to finish loading, a deadlock occurs, as the package load waits for the service return, but that requires the package load to complete. If it ignores the loading state, it returns null, since the service factory hasn’t been registered yet.\nTo make this work, the original design marked a package as “loaded” right before its Initialize/SetSite was called.\nThis was a reasonable compromise in the context of the time, as all package loads were synchronous and occurred on the UI thread, eliminating concerns about concurrent load requests. It also allowed cycles to “work” if the service-providing package registered all its services before attempting to retrieve any services that could lead to a cycle.\nSo Why the Change?\nThe term “work” was used in quotes because, while it sometimes worked, it was unreliable. For it to work, all packages had to register their service factories before making requests that could introduce a cycle. This was unenforceable, error-prone, and led to issues where internal packages would re-query for services if the initial request returned null. It was also susceptible to failure from minor changes, like refactoring initialization code or altering the load order of packages, which could invert the request chain and break the cycle (or introduce another).\nAdditionally, this approach only worked in a single-threaded loading model, which Visual Studio no longer uses.\nIn a multi-threaded loading model, the likelihood of race conditions increases. If a package is marked as loaded before its SetSite/Initialize method is called, a request from another thread may consider the package already loaded and attempt to retrieve the service, racing with the original package’s service factory registration.\nTo prevent null services from being returned due to this race condition, we must ensure that all loads, except the original request, block until the package initialization completes (until Initialize(Async)/SetSite returns). However, blocking on in-progress loads should only occur if the calling thread is independent of the original thread that initiated the load; otherwise, it could deadlock the entire process.\nThe Fix\nTo solve this problem, we rely on AsyncLazy to manage package loads. AsyncLazy uses AsyncLocal to detect re-entrant invocations. It can determine, from the context of any thread, if the caller is related to the original thread that invoked AsyncLazy’s value factory. If so, it throws an exception; if not, it blocks the caller until the original invocation completes.\nThis behavior is exactly what we need, but it means cyclic load requests will now throw an exception, causing a failure. While this is unavoidable (and actually desirable), it represents a change in behavior. This approach ensures a package isn’t considered loaded until its Initialize(Async)/SetSite completes, eliminating the registration race condition, and properly handles concurrent load requests—blocking if unrelated to the original load, or failing otherwise.\nCall to Action\nThis change is necessary to prevent a race condition, which arises from how Visual Studio services are discovered.\nWays to avoid cycles\nSince cycles are no longer allowed, it’s important to avoid creating them. The good news is that changes made to address these issues will also work in older versions, as cycles were never a good idea. While race conditions still exist in older versions, these cannot be avoided without applying this fix more broadly, which would impact a larger user base.\nThe most common mistake we observed was developers being too eager in Initialize(Async)/SetSite, often leading to cycles. Specifically, people would:\nEagerly create service instances, which often required fetching other services.\nEagerly create tool windows, which also required fetching services.\nEagerly fetch services to store in backing fields, even if they weren’t used in Initialize(Async)/SetSite.\nYour Initialize(Async)/SetSite should do minimal work. You won’t know why your package was loaded, but if it was to retrieve a service or load a tool window, those actions will occur by a follow-up call after Initialize(Async)/SetSite completes.\nTo avoid cycles, services can be retrieved “just in time” using Lazy<T> or AsyncLazy<T> outside of Initialize(Async)/SetSite. Similarly, while service factories should be registered eagerly, the actual service creation (which can involve fetching other services) happens only after the package is fully loaded, eliminating the cycle risk.\nTool windows should also be created outside Initialize(Async)/SetSite, and any required services can be fetched at that point. An example of this pattern can be seen here: Upgrading to Visual Studio 2022 17.12.1 displays error Exception from HRESULT: 0x80049283 – Developer Community In this case the extension is eagerly creating its toolwindow inside its InitializeAsync, this is unnecessary. A separate call will be made by the environment when your toolwindow is needed.\nCustomer Value\nThis change was made to reduce instances of services returning null when they should never do so. Such failures are problematic because if the caller doesn’t null-check the result, it could crash Visual Studio. If they do check for null, they must handle the missing service appropriately. Most users opted to disable functionality that depended on the missing service, leading to inconsistent behavior—where Visual Studio sometimes appeared to lack features that worked in previous sessions, even though the code hadn’t changed.\nFor extenders, this change adds some extra work, but it also eliminates the uncertainty around services occasionally returning null. They can now consistently treat null as either a fatal error or an indication that a feature is unavailable, rather than a strange, self-correcting issue that might resolve with a retry.\nConclusion + Thanks\nWe understand that changes to “working” code are generally undesirable. Initially, we didn’t expect many people to be affected, but after issues were reported by two internal teams and one external team, we realized a fix we anticipated would be non-disruptive was, in fact, impacting extenders.\nThis post was directly motivated by user feedback, which alerted us to the issue, rather than users silently adjusting their code without fully understanding the cause, for that we are grateful.\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. Your feedback is critical to help us make Visual Studio the best tool it can be!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We continue to invest in the VisualStudio.Extensibility SDK to allow developers like you to create extensions that run faster and smoother than ever before! VisualStudio.Extensibility helps you build extensions that run outside the main Visual Studio IDE process for improved performance and reliability, and that can be installed without the need to restart Visual Studio. Additional benefits include a sleek and intuitive .NET 8-based API and comprehensive, well-maintained documentation to help you develop amazing extensions faster than ever before.\nGet Started with VisualStudio.Extensibility\n\nIn the recent releases of Visual Studio, we’ve focused on documenting features that are polished for GA, so we haven’t blogged often about features available only in the preview channel. However, some features are worthy of early announcement to gather feedback so we can iterate earlier and make the experience better. Today, we’re writing about one such feature – managing the .NET runtime versions, which is available for you to try out in 17.14 Preview 1.\nA key benefit of VisualStudio.Extensibility is that extensions can run out of process on .NET 8, giving you access to a modern, more performant runtime. However, .NET has some fundamental differences from .NET Framework (netfx): each version of the runtime can run side by side and each version of the runtime goes out of support faster than netfx. A new version of .NET comes out every year, with odd number releases receiving 18 months of support, and even number releases receiving 36 months (see here for the official .NET support policy). Thus, for extensions running out of process on VisualStudio.Extensibility, we must roll forward our version of .NET every so often, even after Visual Studio 2022 is past active development and goes into servicing. To get more details on Visual Studio’s support policy, please see here.\nIn 17.14 preview 1, we are introducing the experience that extension developers and consumers can expect when .NET runtime versions roll forward. The following diagram provides a sample timeline of what you can expect for VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions in VS 2022 in the coming years with respect to .NET runtime versions:\n\nExtension consumers should not expect major or intrusive changes to their workflow when .NET runtime versions are rolled forward. Visual Studio will continue to load their VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions, even if these extensions do not specify that they target the latest supported version of .NET. Let’s wind back time and suppose VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions started running on the .NET 6 runtime. With .NET 6 having just reached its end of life, Visual Studio will now load VisualStudio.Extensibility extensions on .NET 8 runtime, even if the extension did not specify that it supports .NET 8. The following screenshot displays the information (icon) displayed when Visual Studio loads an extension that does not specify it supports the installed .NET runtime. When .NET 8 reaches end-of-life, users can expect a similar transition from .NET 8 to .NET 10.\n\nFor extension developers, you will have an opportunity to try loading your extensions in the new runtime version before the current runtime goes out of support. The following screenshot displays the new F5 debug experience when a new .NET runtime version is available.\n\nFor more information on how to configure your extension to run against different runtimes, please see our official documentation on the subject here.\nWe understand that this model of updating the runtime even when Visual Studio 2022 goes out of active development deviates from how extensions are typically maintained in the in-proc, VSSDK model. For developers familiar with .NET, each version brings about breaking changes, although they are often scoped and announced well in advance. As with most .NET applications, the majority of extensions do not need to be rewritten or updated to target the latest .NET runtime version. If you as extension developers do not want to take on the additional burden of considering .NET runtime version compatibility, you can also choose to run their VisualStudio.Extensibility extension in the main devenv.exe process against the .NET Framework runtime. However, in doing so you would lose the ability to install your extensions without restarting Visual Studio, since the extensions are no longer run in isolation.\nThis is a big shift, so we anticipate a lot of questions around this. We urge you to use our GitHub repo to file issues or sound off your concerns in this Developer Community feedback ticket if you have questions or concerns regarding this change.\nWe want to hear from you!\nThe time and effort you’ve spent reporting issues and sharing suggestions so far has been instrumental in shaping VisualStudio.Extensibility. We need your help as we continue to develop VisualStudio.Extensibility! Please try out the features and APIs announced and let us know what you think. Check out the docs, browse the code samples, and build your first extension. You can send feedback and report issues through our issue tracker.\nTo request features, look at Developer Community to see if someone else made a similar request first. Create a new one if you can’t find a similar request. By checking for similar requests and upvoting and commenting on them, you help us better prioritize requests. Give VisualStudio.Extensibility a try today and share your thoughts with us!\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. Your feedback is critical to help us make Visual Studio the best tool it can be! You can share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn.\nThe post VisualStudio.Extensibility: Managing .NET runtime versions appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

The scene should be set on a winding mountain road at golden hour, featuring a high-performance vehicle with gleaming metallic paint and dynamic motion blur. The composition should be from a low angle perspective with Dutch angle tilt, creating a sense of speed and drama. Implement leading lines from the road markings and guardrails to guide the viewer's eye through the scene. Use foreground elements like scattered leaves and road texture, mid-ground focus on the car itself, and background elements of dramatic mountain scenery to create depth and dimensional layering. The lighting should be cinematic with golden hour sunlight creating dramatic shadows and highlighting the car's curves. Include fine details such as tire treads, carbon fiber textures, LED lighting, and the reflection of surroundings on the car's polished surface. Ensure professional camera settings like DSLR quality for high-definition clarity. Use 8K resolution to capture every minute detail.

USB 케이블로 유선 연결 사용도 가능하고, 블루투스 무선 연결로 최대 2대의 장치와 연결할 수 있는데 총 3대의 연결된 장치 간 전환은 타블렛 상단의 슬라이드를 통해 쉽게 가능합니다.\n \n새로운 인튜어스 프로는 윈도우(Windows)와 맥(Mac) 운영 체제를 지원하며 스테들러(Staedtler), 라미(Lamy), 닥터 그립(Dr. Grip) 등 디지털 펜과 추가 설정 없이 호환됩니다.\n \n \n인튜어스 프로의 가격과 출시일자\n \n반응형\n\n    \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n  \n \n인튜어스 프로의 국내 출시가는 아직 밝혀지지 않았습니다만, 미국의 경우 대형-중형-소형이 각각 $499.95, $379.95, $249.95으로 대략 72만5천원-55만1천원-36만3천원에 해당하니 참고하시기 바랍니다.\n \n인튜어스 프로는 대한민국에 3월에 출시할 예정이며 정확한 가격 및 자세한 내용은 그때 다시 발표될 것으로 보입니다.\n \n(출처 : 와콤)\n \n \n와콤(WACOM) 관련 글 보기",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "올해도 첫 번째 그랜드슬램 테니스 대회인 호주 오픈이 잘 끝났다. 마지막에 노장 노박 조코비치가 컨디션 난조로 기권하면서 내가 응원하는 선수들은 모두 탈락했지만, 좋은 젊은 선수들의 경기는 매우 흥미로웠다. 이번에도 다양한 선수들이 등장했고, 예상치 못한 다크호스들이 발굴됐는데, 당분간은 남자 테니스도 계속 물갈이를 반복하며 운이 좋은 선수와 실력이 있는 선수가 확실히 구분되지 않을까 생각한다.\n최근 몇 년 동안 반짝 떴던 선수들이 올해는 초반에 많이 탈락했는데, 이들은 겉으론 화려하고, 본인들이 스스로 PR을 매우 잘해서 항상 이슈 메이킹을 하지만, 경기 내용을 보면 단단하지가 않고 뭔가 항상 불안하다는 느낌을 받는다. 모두 다 젊고, 포핸드이든 백핸드이든 강력한 무기는 하나씩 갖고 있는데, 왜 항상 불안한 플레이를 하는지 조금 자세히 보면, 이들의 기본기가 탄탄하지 않다는 느낌을 받는다. 기본기가 탄탄하지 않으면 잘하는 선수한테 절대로 못 이기는데, 이들이 최근 몇 년 동안 떴고, 어떤 이들은 그랜드슬램 대회에서 우승까지 했던 – 물론, 딱 한 번이다. 그 이상은 힘들다. – 이유를 생각해 보면, 그냥 운이 좋았다. 진짜 잘하는 상위 랭커들이 어쩌다 초반에 탈락해서 이들과 대진표에서 만나지 않았거나, 붙었는데 컨디션 난조 때문에 진 걸 운 좋은 선수들이 실력으로 이겼다고 착각했던 것이다.\n이반 렌들, 피트 샘프라스, 로저 페더러, 라파엘 나달, 그리고 노박 조코비치. 이들은 내가 생생하게 기억하는 근대 남자 테니스 역사상 가장 뛰어난 선수들인데, 이들의 공통점은 완벽한 기본기 위에 자기만의 무기를 개발했다는 것이다. 테니스의 기본기에 대해서 말하면 항상 생각나는 인터뷰가 있다. 라파엘 나달의 인터뷰인데 아마도 이 인터뷰도 오래전 호주 오픈에서 치열한 5세트 접전까지 가서 우승한 후에 했던 걸로 기억한다. 어떻게 이런 훌륭한 경기를 했고, 멋지게 이겼는지 사회자가 물어보자, 나달은 이렇게 짧게 대답했다. “I ran very fast and I hit very hard.”\n그 인터뷰를 봤을 때, 뭐 저런 초등학생 같은 이야기를,,,이라고 생각했지만, 곰곰이 생각해 보면 굉장히 심오한 이야기고, 테니스나 다른 운동이나, 또는 인생에서 가장 중요한 ‘탄탄한 기본기’에 대한 이야기라는 걸 알 수 있다. 빨리 뛰고, 세게 치는 건 너무나 당연한 테니스의 기본이지만, 이 기본기가 완벽한 프로 테니스 선수들이 몇 명 안 된다. 그 몇 안 되는 선수들이 지금 상위 랭커들이다.\n인생도 마찬가지다. 기본기가 없는 사람들은 인생에서 성공할 수가 없다. 인생의 기본기가 뭐냐고 나에게 물어본다면, 자기만의 철학, 생각, 근면, 성실, 루틴, 규율 등이라고 생각한다.\n사업도 마찬가지다. 기본기가 없는 사업은 잘 될 수가 없다. 우리가 투자하는 초기 스타트업의 기본은 주로 제품, 고객, 매출 등이다. 이런 기본기를 제대로 만들지도 않고 겉만 화려한 창업가나 사업은 운 좋게 한두 번은 반짝 뜰 수 있지만, 지속 가능한 사업이 될 순 없다. PR을 얼마나 잘하는지, 투자를 얼마나 크게 받았는지, 어떤 유명한 VC에게 투자받았는지, 대표이사의 팔로워 수가 몇 명인지 등은 사업의 기본기와 지속가능성과는 큰 상관은 없다. 제대로 된 제품을 만들어서, 돈을 내는 고객을 많이 확보하고, 이에 따라서 매출을 만드는 게 사업의 기본이다. 안타깝지만, 이런 사업의 기본기에 대해 아예 모르거나, 아니면 사업을 하는 과정에서 기본기를 잊어버리는 창업가들이 꽤 많다.\n기본기가 탄탄하면 경기의 95%는 이길 것이다. 나머지 5%까지 이기고 싶다면 탄탄한 기본기 위에서 오랫동안 다양한 실험과 실수를 하면서 자기만의 무기를 완성해야 한다. 하지만, 기본기가 탄탄하지 않으면 경기의 95%는 질 것이다.",

'우리가 출발선에 다시 서는 곳'이라는 부제 아래, 공간을 찾는 방문객들의 새로운 시작과 다짐을 응원하고 토스가 함께한다는 의미를 담고 있다. 공간의 모티프를 광장으로 삼아 ‘스퀘어(Square)’라는 이름을 붙였으며, 조건이나 자격 없이 누구나 방문할 수 있는 곳을 만들고자 하는 의도를 담았다.\n스퀘어 오브 토스는 2월 26일부터 3월 2일까지 5일간 서울 성동구 성수동에 위치한 ‘앤더슨씨 성수’에서 열린다. 앱 출시 10주년을 기념하며 선보이는 전시 ‘10의 여정’은 토스가 지난 10년간 만들어온 변화를 확인하고 체험할 수 있도록 구성했다. 방문객이 본인의 금융 성향을 테스트하고 맞춤형 금융 정보를 확인할 수 있는 ‘금융 플래닝 라운지’도 마련한다. 또한, 새로운 출발을 돕는 도서 100종을 큐레이션한 ‘라이브러리’, 10주년 기념품을 판매하는 ‘기념품 숍’, 토스 사내 카페 ‘커피 사일로’를 그대로 가져온 카페도 운영한다.\n2월 28일부터 3월 2일까지 3일간은 금융 생활과 삶의 변화를 계획하는 데 도움을 줄 다양한 연사들의 토크 세션을 개최한다. 지난 10년간 토스가 쌓아온 성공 전략을 공유하는 '토스 위닝 세션'과 금융 생활뿐 아니라 삶을 계획하는 데 실질적인 도움이 될 수 있는 '넥스트 토크 세션' 등 총 두 가지 프로그램을 진행한다.\n토스 위닝 세션은 서비스, 비즈니스, 디자인, 개발, 기업 문화 등을 포함해 총 6개로 구성했다. 이승건 토스팀 리더를 비롯해 김규하 최고사업책임자, 박서진 프론트엔드 헤드, 강수영 프로덕트 디자인 헤드 등 토스팀 안에서 각 분야를 담당하는 연사들이 직접 발표에 나선다. 넥스트 토크 세션의 경우 송길영 작가, 정희원 노년내과 교수, 김경필 머니트레이너 등 업계 주요 오피니언 리더들을 초빙한다.\n\n세션 참가 신청은 13일 오후 2시부터 10 to 100 공식 홈페이지에서 받는다. 참가 비용은 무료다. 세션 이외의 프로그램은 모두 상시로 운영한다. 스퀘어 오브 토스의 운영 시간은 오전 11시부터 오후 8시 30분까지이며, 첫날인 2월 26일은 오후 3시부터 입장이 가능하다.\n토스 관계자는 “스퀘어 오브 토스는 누구나 방문할 수 있는 광장을 모티브로 한 공간인 만큼, 많은 분들이 자유롭게 방문해 각자의 새로운 출발에 실질적인 도움과 영감을 얻어가시길 바란다”라고 전했다.\n스퀘어 오브 토스와 관련한 자세한 내용은 캠페인 공식 웹사이트 및 토스 공식 소셜 채널에서 확인할 수 있다.",
