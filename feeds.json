        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re presenting Design for Sustainability,  a set of technical design principles for new designs of IT hardware to reduce emissions and cost through reuse, extending useful life, and optimizing design.\nAt Meta, we’ve been able to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of our data centers by integrating several design strategies such as modularity, reuse, retrofitting, dematerialization, using greener materials, and extended hardware lifecycles, Meta can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its data center infrastructure. \nWe’re inviting the wider industry to also adopt the strategies outlined here to help reach sustainability goals.\nThe data centers, server hardware, and global network infrastructure that underpin Meta’s operations are a critical focus to address the environmental impact of our operations. As we develop and deploy the compute capacity and storage racks used in data centers, we are focused on our goal to reach net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030. To do this, we prioritize interventions to reduce emissions associated with this hardware, including collaborating with hardware suppliers to reduce upstream emissions.\nWhat Is Design for Sustainability? \nDesign for Sustainability is a set of guidelines, developed and proposed by Meta, to aid hardware designers in reducing the environmental impact of IT racks. This considers various factors such as energy efficiency and the selection, reduction, circularity, and end-of-life disposal of materials used in hardware. Sustainable hardware design requires collaboration between hardware designers, engineers, and sustainability experts to create hardware that meets performance requirements while limiting environmental impact.\nIn this guide, we specifically focus on the design of racks that power our data centers and offer alternatives for various components (e.g., mechanicals, cooling, compute, storage and cabling) that can help rack designers make sustainable choices early in the product’s lifecycle. \nOur Focus on Scope 3 Emissions\nTo reach our net zero goal, we are primarily focused on reducing our Scope 3 (or value chain) emissions from physical sources like data center construction and our IT hardware (compute, storage and cooling equipment) and network fiber infrastructure.\nWhile the energy efficiency of the hardware itself deployed in our data centers helps reduce energy consumption, we have to also consider IT hardware emissions associated with the manufacturing and delivery of equipment to Meta, as well as the end-of-life disposal, recycling, or resale of this hardware.\nOur methods for controlling and reducing Scope 3 emissions generally involve optimizing material selection, choosing and developing lower carbon alternatives in design, and helping to reduce the upstream emissions of our suppliers.\nFor internal teams focused on hardware, this involves:\nOptimizing hardware design for the lowest possible emissions, extending the useful life of materials as much as possible with each system design, or using lower carbon materials.\nBeing more efficient by extending the useful life of IT racks to potentially skip new generations of equipment.\nHarvesting server components that are no longer available to be used as spares. When racks reach their end-of-life, some of the components still have service life left in them and can be harvested and reused in a variety of ways. Circularity programs harvest components such as dual In-line memory modules (DIMMs) from end-of-life racks and redeploy them in new builds.\nKnowing the emissions profiles of suppliers, components, and system designs. This in turn informs future roadmaps that will further reduce emissions.\nCollaborating with suppliers to electrify their manufacturing processes, to transition to renewable energy, and to leverage lower carbon materials and designs.\nThese actions to reduce Scope 3 emissions from our IT hardware also have the additional benefit of reducing the amount of electronic waste (e-waste) generated from our data centers.\nAn Overview of the Types of Racks We Deploy \nThere are many different rack designs deployed within Meta’s data centers to support different workloads and infrastructure needs, mainly:\nAI – AI training and inference workloads\nCompute – General compute needed for running Meta’s products and services\nStorage – Storing and maintaining data used by our products\nNetwork – Providing Low-latency interconnections between servers\nWhile there are differences in architecture across these different rack types, most of these racks apply general hardware design principles and contain active and passive components from a similar group of suppliers. As such, the same design principles for sustainability apply across these varied rack types.\nWithin each rack, there are five main categories of components that are targeted for emissions reductions: \nCompute (i.e., memory, HDD/SSD)\nStorage\nNetwork\nPower\nRack infrastructure (i.e., mechanical and thermals)\nThe emissions breakdown for a generic compute rack is shown below.\n\nOur Techniques for Reducing Emissions\nWe focus on four main categories to address emissions associated with these hardware components:\n\nWe will cover a few of the levers listed above in detail below.\nModular Rack Designs\nModular Design which allows older rack components to be re-used in newer racks. Open Rack designs (ORv2 & ORv3) form the bulk of high volume racks that exist in our data centers. \n\nHere are some key aspects of the ORv3 modular rack design:\nORv3 separates Power Supply Units (PSUs) and Battery Backup Units (BBUs) into their own shelves.\nThis allows for more reliable and flexible configurations, making repairs and replacements easier as each field replaceable unit (FRU) is toolless to replace.\nPower and flexibility \nThe ORv3 design includes a 48 V power output, which allows the power shelf to be placed anywhere in the rack. This is an improvement over the previous ORV2 design, which limited the power shelf to a specific power zone\nConfigurations \nThe rack can accommodate different configurations of PSU and BBU shelves to meet various platform and regional requirements. For example, North America uses a dual AC input per PSU shelf, while Europe and Asia use a single AC input. \nCommonization effort \nThere is an ongoing effort to design a “commonized” ORv3 rack frame that incorporates features from various rack variations into one standard frame. This aims to streamline the assembly process, reduce quality risks, and lower overall product costs \nORv3N \nA derivative of ORv3, known as ORv3N, is designed for network-specific applications. It includes in-rack PSU and BBU, offering efficiency and cost improvements over traditional in-row UPS systems \nThese design principles should continue to be followed in successive generations of racks. With the expansion of AI workloads, new specialized racks for compute, storage, power and cooling are being developed that are challenging  designers to adopt the most modular design principles. \nRe-Using/Retrofitting Existing Rack Designs\nRetrofitting existing rack designs for new uses/high density is a cost-effective and sustainable approach to meet evolving data center needs. This strategy can help reduce e-waste, lower costs, and accelerate deployment times. Benefits of re-use/retrofitting include:\nCost savings \nRetrofitting existing racks can be significantly cheaper compared to purchasing new racks.\nReduced e-waste \nReusing existing racks reduces the amount of e-waste generated by data centers.\nFaster deployment \nRetrofitting existing racks can be completed faster than deploying new racks, as it eliminates the need for procurement and manufacturing lead times.\nEnvironmental benefits \nReducing e-waste and reusing existing materials helps minimize the environmental impact of data centers.\nThere are several challenges when considering re-using or retrofitting racks:\nCompatibility issues\nEnsuring compatibility between old and new components can be challenging.\nPower and cooling requirements\nRetrofitting existing racks may require upgrades to power and cooling systems to support new equipment.\nScalability and flexibility \nRetrofitting existing racks may limit scalability and flexibility in terms of future upgrades or changes.\nTesting and validation\nThorough testing and validation are required to ensure that retrofitted racks meet performance and reliability standards.\nOverall, the benefits of retrofitting existing racks are substantial and should be examined in every new rack design.\nGreen Steel\nSteel is a significant portion of a rack and chassis and substituting traditional steel with green steel can reduce emissions. Green steel is typically produced using electric arc furnaces (EAF) instead of traditional basic oxygen furnaces (BOF), allowing for the use of clean and renewable electricity and a higher quantity of recycled content. This approach significantly reduces carbon emissions associated with steel production. Meta collaborates with suppliers who offer green steel produced with 100% clean and renewable energy.\nRecycled Steel, Aluminum, and Copper\nWhile steel is a significant component of rack and chassis, aluminum and copper are extensively used in heat sinks and wiring. Recycling steel, aluminum, and copper saves significant energy needed to produce hardware from raw materials. \nAs part of our commitment to sustainability, we now require all racks/chassis to contain a minimum of 20% recycled steel. Additionally, all heat sinks must be manufactured entirely from recycled aluminum or copper. These mandates are an important step in our ongoing sustainability journey.\nSeveral of our steel suppliers, such as Tata Steel, provide recycled steel. Product design teams may ask their original design manufacturer (ODM) partners to make sure that recycled steel is included in the steel vendor(s) selected by Meta’s ODM partners. Similarly, there are many vendors that are providing recycled aluminum and copper products.\nImproving Reliability to Extend Useful Life\nExtending the useful life of racks, servers, memory, and SSDs helps Meta reduce the number of hardware equipment that needs to be ordered. This has helped achieve significant reductions in both emissions and costs. \nA key requirement for extending useful life of hardware is the reliability of the hardware component or rack. Benchmarking reliability is an important element to determine whether hardware life extensions are feasible and for how long. Additional consideration needs to be given to the fact that spares and vendor support may have diminishing availability. Also, extending hardware life also comes with the risk of increased equipment failure, so a clear strategy to deal with the higher incidence of potential failure should be put in place.\nDematerialization\nDematerialization and removal of unnecessary hardware components can lead to a significant reduction in the use of raw materials, water, and/or energy. This entails reducing the use of raw materials such as steel on racks or removing unnecessary components on server motherboards while maintaining the design constraints established for the rack and its components. \nDematerialization also involves consolidating multiple racks into fewer, more efficient ones, reducing their overall physical footprint. \nExtra components on hardware boards are included for several reasons:\nFuture-proofing \nComponents might be added to a circuit board in anticipation of future upgrades or changes in the design. This allows manufacturers to easily modify the board without having to redesign it from scratch.\nFlexibility \nExtra components can provide flexibility in terms of configuration options. For example, a board might have multiple connectors or interfaces that can be used depending on the specific application.\nDebugging and testing\nAdditional components can be used for debugging and testing purposes. These components might include test points, debug headers, or other features that help engineers diagnose issues during development.\nRedundancy \nIn some cases, extra components are included to provide redundancy in case one component fails. This is particularly important in high-reliability applications where system failure could have significant consequences.\nModularity \nExtra components can make a board more modular, allowing users to customize or upgrade their system by adding or removing modules.\nRegulatory compliance\nSome components might be required for regulatory compliance, such as safety features or electromagnetic interference (EMI) filtering.\nIn addition, changes in requirements over time can also lead to extra components. While it is very difficult to modify systems in production, it is important to make sure that each hardware design optimizes for components that will be populated. \nExamples of extra components on hardware boards include:\nUnpopulated integrated circuit (IC) sockets or footprints\nUnused connectors or headers\nTest points or debug headers\nRedundant power supplies or capacitors\nOptional memory or storage components\nUnconnected or reserved pins on ICs\nIn addition to hardware boards, excess components may also be present in other parts of the rack. Removing excess components can lead to lowering the emissions footprint of a circuit board or rack. \nProductionizing New Technologies With Lower Emissions\nProductionizing new technologies can help Meta significantly reduce emissions. Memory and SSD/HDD are typically the single largest source of embodied carbon emissions in a server rack. New technologies can help Meta reduce emissions and costs while providing a substantially higher power-normalized performance. \nExamples of such technologies include:\nTransitioning to SSD from HDD can reduce emissions by requiring fewer drives, servers, racks, BBUs, and PSUs, as well as help reduce overall energy usage. \nDepending on local environmental conditions, and the data center’s workload, using liquid cooling in server racks can be up to 17% more carbon-efficient than traditional air cooling.\nSource: OCP Global Summit, Oct 15-17, 2024, San Jose, CA.\nTeams can explore additional approaches to reduce emissions associated with memory/SSD/HDD which include:\nAlternate technologies such as phase-change memory (PCM) or Magnetoresistive Random-Access Memory (MRAM) that have the same performance with low carbon.\nUse Low-Power Double Data Rates (LPDDRs ) for low power consumption and high bandwidth instead of DDR.\nRemoving/reusing unused memory modules to reduce energy usage or down-clocking them during idle periods.\nUsing fewer high capacity memory modules to reduce power and cooling needs. Use High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) which uses much less energy than the DDR memory.\nChoosing the Right Suppliers\nMeta engages with suppliers to reduce emissions through its net zero supplier engagement program. This program is designed to set GHG reduction targets with selected suppliers to help achieve our net zero target. Key aspects of the program include:\nProviding capacity building: Training suppliers on how to measure emissions, set science-aligned targets, build reduction roadmaps, procure renewable energy, and understand energy markets. \nScaling up: In 2021 the program started with 39 key suppliers; by 2024 it expanded to include 183 suppliers, who together account for over half of Meta’s supplier-related emissions. \nSetting target goals: Meta aims to have two-thirds of its suppliers set science-aligned greenhouse gas reduction targets by 2026 . As of end-2024, 48% (by emissions contribution) have done so. \nThe Clean Energy Procurement Academy (CEPA), launched in 2023 (with Meta and other corporations), helps suppliers — especially in the Asia-Pacific region — learn how to procure renewable energy via region-specific curricula. \nThe Road to Net Zero Emissions\nThe Design for Sustainability principles outlined in this guide represent an important step forward in Meta’s goal to achieve net zero emissions in 2030. By integrating innovative design strategies such as modularity, reuse, retrofitting, and dematerialization, alongside the adoption of greener materials and extended hardware lifecycles, Meta can significantly reduce the carbon footprint of its data center infrastructure. These approaches not only lower emissions but also drive cost savings, e-waste reductions, and operational efficiency, reinforcing sustainability as a core business value.\nCollaboration across hardware designers, engineers, suppliers, and sustainability experts is essential to realize these goals. The ongoing engagement with suppliers further amplifies the impact by addressing emissions across our entire value chain. As Meta continues to evolve its rack designs and operational frameworks, the focus on sustainability will remain paramount, ensuring that future infrastructure innovations support both environmental responsibility and business performance.\nUltimately, the success of these efforts will be measured by tangible emissions reductions, extended useful life of server hardware, and the widespread adoption of low carbon technologies and materials. \nThe post Design for Sustainability: New Design Principles for Reducing IT Hardware Emissions appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we focus on our goal of achieving net zero emissions in 2030, we also aim to create a common taxonomy for the entire industry to measure carbon emissions.\nWe’re sharing details on a new methodology we presented at the 2025 OCP regional EMEA summit that leverages AI to improve our understanding of our IT hardware’s Scope 3 emissions.\nWe are collaborating with the OCP PCR workstream to open source this methodology for the wider industry. This collaboration will be introduced at the 2025 OCP Global Summit.\nAs Meta focuses on achieving net zero emissions in 2030, understanding the carbon footprint of server hardware is crucial for making informed decisions about sustainable sourcing and design. However, calculating the precise carbon footprint is challenging due to complex supply chains and limited data from suppliers. IT hardware used in our data centers is a significant source of emissions, and the embodied carbon associated with the manufacturing and transportation of this hardware is particularly challenging to quantify.\nTo address this, we developed a methodology to estimate and track the carbon emissions of hundreds of millions of components in our data centers. This approach involves a combination of cost-based estimates, modeled estimates, and component-specific product carbon footprints (PCFs) to provide a detailed understanding of embodied carbon emissions. These component-level estimates are ranked by the quality of data and aggregated at the server rack level.\nBy using this approach, we can analyze emissions at multiple levels of granularity, from individual screws to entire rack assemblies. This comprehensive framework allows us to identify high-impact areas for emissions reduction. \nOur ultimate goal is to drive the industry to adopt more sustainable manufacturing practices and produce components with reduced emissions. This initiative underscores the importance of high-quality data and collaboration with suppliers to enhance the accuracy of carbon footprint calculations to drive more sustainable practices.\nWe leveraged AI to help us improve this database and understand our Scope 3 emissions associated with IT hardware by:\nIdentifying similar components and applying existing PCFs to similar components that lack these carbon estimates.\nExtracting data from heterogeneous data sources to be used in parameterized models.\nUnderstanding the carbon footprint of IT racks and applying generative AI (GenAI) as a categorization algorithm to create a new and standard taxonomy. This taxonomy helps us understand the hierarchy and hotspots in our fleet and allows us to provide insights to the data center design team in their language. We hope to iterate on this taxonomy with the data center industry and agree on an industry-wide standard that allows us to compare IT hardware carbon footprints for different types and generations of hardware.\nWhy We Are Leveraging AI \nFor this work we used various AI methods to enhance the accuracy and coverage of Scope 3 emission estimates for our IT hardware. Our approach leverages the unique strengths of both  natural language processing (NLP) and large language models (LLMs). \nNLP For Identifying Similar Components\nIn our first use case (Identifying similar components with AI), we employed various NLP techniques such as Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and Cosine similarity to identify patterns within a bounded, relatively small dataset. Specifically, we applied this method to determine the similarity between different components. This approach allowed us to develop a highly specialized model for this specific task.\nLLMs For Handling and Understanding Data\nLLMs are pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, enabling them to learn general patterns and relationships in language. They go through a post-training phase to adapt to specific use cases such as chatbots. We apply LLMs, specifically Llama 3.1, in the following three different scenarios:\nTo extract and process information from diverse data sources. The benefit of LLMs is that the model can recognize different representations of the same information, even if formatted or phrased differently. (see section: Extracting Data From Heterogeneous Data)\nTo understand potential groupings of components, aiding in the creation of a new taxonomy. (see section: A Component-Level Breakdown of IT Hardware Emissions Using AI)\nOnce categories are identified, we use an LLM to strictly classify components based on text strings. This method allows us to save significant training time compared to a traditional AI model, as LLMs can be quickly prompt-engineered to handle various tasks. (see section: A Component-Level Breakdown of IT Hardware Emissions Using AI)\nUnlike the first use case, where we needed a highly specialized model to detect similarities, we opted for LLM for these three use cases because it leverages general human language rules.  This includes handling different units for parameters, grouping synonyms into categories, and recognizing varied phrasing or terminology that conveys the same concept. This approach allows us to efficiently handle variability and complexity in language, which would have required significantly more time and effort to achieve using only traditional AI. \nIdentifying Similar Components With AI\nWhen analyzing inventory components, it’s common for multiple identifiers to represent the same parts or slight variations of them. This can occur due to differences in lifecycle stages, minor compositional variations, or new iterations of the part.\nPCFs following the GHG Protocol are the highest quality input data we can reference for each component, as they typically account for the Scope 3 emissions estimates throughout the entire lifecycle of the component. However, conducting a PCF is a time-consuming process that typically takes months. Therefore, when we receive PCF information, it is crucial to ensure that we map all the components correctly.\nPCFs are typically tied to a specific identifier, along with aggregated components. For instance, a PCF might be performed specifically for a particular board in a server, but there could be numerous variations of this specific component within an inventory. The complexity increases as the subcomponents of these items are often identical, meaning the potential impact of a PCF can be significantly multiplied across a fleet.\nTo maximize the utility of a PCF, it is essential to not only identify the primary component and its related subcomponents but also identify all similar parts that a PCF could be applied to. If these similar components are not identified their carbon footprint estimates will remain at a lower data quality. Therefore, identifying similar components is crucial to ensure that we:\nLeverage PCF information to ensure the highest data quality for all components.\nMaintain consistency within the dataset, ensuring that similar components have the same or closely aligned estimates.\nImprove traceability of each component’s carbon footprint estimate for reporting.\nTo achieve this, we employed a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm, specifically tailored to the language of this dataset, to identify possible proxy components by analyzing textual descriptions and filtering results by component category to ensure relevance.\nThe algorithm identifies proxy components in two distinct ways:\nLeveraging New PCFs: When a new PCF is received, the algorithm uses it as a reference point. It analyzes the description names of components within the same category to identify those with a high percentage of similarity. These similar components can be mapped to a representative proxy PCF, allowing us to use high-quality PCF data in similar components.\nImproving Low Data Quality Components: For components with low data quality scores, the algorithm operates in reverse with additional constraints. Starting with a list of low-data-quality components, the algorithm searches for estimates that have a data quality score greater than a certain threshold. These high-quality references can then be used to improve the data quality of the original low-scoring components.\nMeta’s Net Zero team reviews the proposed proxies and validates our ability to apply them in our estimates. This approach enhances the accuracy and consistency of component data, ensures that high-quality PCF data is effectively utilized across similar components, and enables us to design our systems to more effectively reduce emissions associated with server hardware.\nExtracting Data From Heterogeneous Data Sources\nWhen PCFs are not available, we aim to avoid using spend-to-carbon methods because they tie sustainability too closely to spending on hardware and can be less accurate due to the influence of factors like supply chain disruptions. \nInstead, we have developed a portfolio of methods to estimate the carbon footprint of these components, including through parameterized modeling. To adapt any model at scale, we require two essential elements: a deterministic model to scale the emissions, and a list of data input parameters. For example, we can scale the carbon footprint calculation for a component by knowing its constituent components’ carbon footprint.\nHowever, applying this methodology can be challenging due to inconsistent description data or locations where information is presented. For instance, information about cables may be stored in different tables, formats, or units, so we may be unable to apply models to some components due to difficulty in locating  input data.\nTo overcome this challenge, we have utilized large language models (LLMs) that extract information from heterogeneous sources and inject the extracted information into the parameterized model. This differs from how we apply NLP, as it focuses on extracting information from specific components. Scaling a common model ensures that the estimates provided for these parts are consistent with similar parts from the same family and can inform estimates for missing or misaligned parts.\nWe applied this approach to two specific categories: memory and cables. The LLM extracts relevant data (e.g., the capacity for memory estimates and length/type of cable for physics-based estimates) and scales the components’ emissions calculations according to the provided formulas. \nA Component-Level Breakdown of IT Hardware Emissions Using AI\nWe utilize our centralized component carbon footprint database not only for reporting emissions, but also to drive our ability to efficiently deploy emissions reduction interventions. Conducting a granular analysis of component-level emissions enables us to pinpoint specific areas for improvement and prioritize our efforts to achieve net zero emissions. For instance, if a particular component is found to have a disproportionately high carbon footprint, we can explore alternative materials or manufacturing processes to mitigate its environmental impact. We may also determine that we should reuse components and extend their useful life by testing or augmenting component reliability. By leveraging data-driven insights at the component level and driving proactive design interventions to reduce component emissions, we can more effectively prioritize sustainability when designing new servers.\nWe leverage a bill of materials (BOM) to list all of the components in a server rack in a tree structure, with “children” component nodes listed under “parent” nodes. However, each vendor can have a different BOM structure, so two identical racks may be represented differently. This, coupled with the heterogeneity of methods to estimate emissions, makes it challenging to easily identify actions to reduce component emissions.\nTo address this challenge, we have used AI to categorize the descriptive data of our racks into two hierarchical levels:\nDomain-level: A high-level breakdown of a rack into main functional groupings (e.g., compute, network, power, mechanical, and storage)\nComponent-level: A detailed breakdown that highlights the major components that are responsible for the bulk of Scope 3 emissions (e.g., CPU, GPU, DRAM, Flash, etc.)\nWe have developed two classification models: one for “domain” mapping, and another for “component” mapping. The difference between these mappings lies in the training data and the additional set of examples provided to each model. We then combine the two classifications to generate a mutually exclusive hierarchy.\nDuring the exploration phase of the new taxonomy generation, we allowed the GenAI model to operate freely to identify potential categories for grouping. After reviewing these potential groupings with our internal hardware experts, we established a fixed list of major components. Once this list was finalized, we switched to using a strict GenAI classifier model as follows:\nFor each rack, recursively identify the highest contributors, grouping smaller represented items together.\nRun a GenAI mutually exclusive classifier algorithm to group the components into the identified categories.\n \nThe emissions breakdown for a generic compute rack.\nThis methodology has been presented at the 2025 OCP regional EMEA summit with the goal to drive the industry toward a common taxonomy for carbon footprint emissions, and open source the methodology we used to create our taxonomy.\nThese groupings are specifically created to aid carbon footprint analysis, rather than for other purposes such as cost analysis. However, the methodology can be tailored for other purposes as necessary.\nComing Soon: Open Sourcing Our Taxonomies and Methodologies\nAs we work toward achieving net zero emissions across our value chain in 2030, this component-level breakdown methodology is necessary to help understand our emissions at the server component level. By using a combination of high-quality PCFs, spend-to-carbon data, and a portfolio of methods that leverage AI, we can enhance our data quality and coverage to more effectively deploy emissions reduction interventions. \nOur next steps include open sourcing:\nThe taxonomy and methodology for server rack emissions accounting.\nThe taxonomy builder using GenAI classifiers.\nThe aggregation methodology to improve facility reporting processes across the industry.\nWe are committed to sharing our learnings with the industry as we evolve this methodology, now as part of a collaborative effort with the OCP PCR group.\nThe post How Meta Is Leveraging AI To Improve the Quality of Scope 3 Emission Estimates for IT Hardware appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

Open hardware plays a crucial role in enabling disaggregation, allowing us to break down traditional data center technologies into their core components. This approach empowers us to build systems that are more flexible, scalable, and efficient.\nSince co-founding the Open Compute Project (OCP) in 2011, Meta has shared data center and component designs, and open-sourced our network operating system, FBOSS,  to inspire new ideas both within our own operations and across the industry. These efforts have played an important role in making Meta’s data centers sustainable and efficient. Today, through OCP, we continue to advance open network technologies for the next generation of AI applications.\nWe’re announcing several new milestones for our data center networking: \nThe evolution of Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF) to support scale-out interconnect for large AI clusters that span entire data center buildings. \nA new Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) architecture based entirely on shallow-buffer, disaggregated Ethernet switches that will support our largest AI clusters like Prometheus. \nThe addition of Minipack3N, based on NVIDIA’s Ethernet Spectrum-4 ASIC, to our portfolio of 51 Tbps OCP switches that use OCP’s SAI and Meta’s FBOSS software stack.\nThe launch of the Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN) initiative, where Meta has worked with other large-scale operators and leading Ethernet vendors to advance using Ethernet for scale-up networking (specifically the high-performance interconnects required for next-generation AI accelerator architectures..\nDual-Stage DSF: Scaling Scheduled Fabrics for Larger AI Clusters\nAt last year’s OCP Global Summit we shared Disaggregated Scheduled Fabric (DSF), a VOQ-based system powered by the open OCP-SAI standard and FBOSS. The DSF fabric supports an open and standard Ethernet-based RoCE interface to endpoints and accelerators across several xPUs and NICs, including Meta’s MTIA as well as from several vendors.\nOver the last year, we have evolved DSF to a 2-stage architecture, scaling to support a non-blocking fabric that interconnects up to 18,432 XPUs. These clusters are a fundamental building block for constructing AI clusters that span regions (and even multiple regions) in order to meet the increased capacity and performance demands of Meta’s AI workloads.\nThe new dual-stage DSF architecture supports non-blocking fabric, enabling interconnect between a larger number of GPUs in a cluster. At Meta, we’ve used it to build out clusters of 18k GPUs at the scale of entire data center buildings.\nNon-Scheduled Fabrics (NSF) for Large AI Clusters\nIn parallel with the evolution of the DSF architecture, we have also devised a new architecture called the Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF), with the following key features:\nBased on shallow-buffer OCP Ethernet switches.\nDelivers low round-trip latency.\nSupports adaptive routing for effective load-balancing, ensuring optimal utilization and minimizing congestion.\nServes as foundational building block for Gigawatt-scale AI clusters like Prometheus.\nNSF — Three-tier Non-Scheduled Fabrics for building scale AI clusters.\nNew OCP Switch Platforms for Next-Generation AI Fabrics\nLast year, Meta introduced two new 51T Ethernet switches: Minipack3 (based on Broadcom Tomahawk5) and Cisco 8501 (based on Cisco Silicon One G200). These OCP switches offer 51.2 Tbps (64x OSFP ports), are power-efficient without the need for retimers, and run our large-scale network operating system, FBOSS. These platforms have served as the foundation for building our next-generation frontend and backend data center fabrics. \nThis year, we are introducing Minipack3N, a new 51T Ethernet switch that is based on the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 switching ASIC and leverages the same system design as Minipack3.\nThe Minipack3N, a 51.2 Tbps switch (designed by Meta and manufactured by Accton) based on the NVIDIA Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching ASIC.\nEvolving FBOSS and SAI for DSF and NSF\n\nMeta continues to embrace OCP-SAI as the foundation for onboarding new network fabrics, switch hardware platforms, and optical transceivers into FBOSS. Through close collaboration with vendors and the OCP community, we have evolved SAI to support advanced features and concepts, including DSF, NSF, and other enhanced routing schemes tailored for modern data center and AI workloads.\nThis open approach empowers developers and engineers worldwide to engage with cutting-edge hardware, contribute innovative software, and leverage these solutions for their own needs. By sharing advancements and fostering collaboration, we help accelerate progress across the industry, ensuring that open hardware and software remain at the heart of scalable, efficient, and future-ready data center infrastructure.\nOptics: 2x400G FR4-LITE and 400G/2x400G DR4 Optics for 400G/800G Optical Interconnections\nLast year, Meta introduced 2x400G FR4 BASE (3-km) optics, the primary solution supporting next-generation 51T platforms across both backend and frontend networks and DSFs. These optics have now been widely deployed throughout Meta’s data centers. \nThis year, we are expanding our portfolio with the launch of 2x400G FR4 LITE (500-m) optics. Developed as part of an efficiency initiative, FR4 LITE is optimized for the majority of intra–data center use cases, supporting fiber links up to 500 meters. This new variant is designed to accelerate optics cost reduction while maintaining robust performance for shorter-reach applications.\nIn addition, we are introducing the 400G DR4 OSFP-RHS optics — our first-generation DR4 solution for AI host-side NIC connectivity. Complementing this, the new 2x400G DR4 OSFP optics are being deployed on the switch side, providing connectivity from host to switch.\nThe 400G DR4 (left), 2x400G DR4 (center), and the 2x400G FR4 LITE (right).\nEthernet for Scale-Up Networking in OCP: Meta’s Industry Leadership\nAt Meta, we recognize that the future of AI and data center infrastructure depends on open, scalable, and interoperable networking solutions. As part of our ongoing commitment to open hardware and industry collaboration, Meta is a founding participant in the new Ethernet for Scale-Up Networking (ESUN) initiative, which launched within OCP at the 2025 OCP Global Summit.\nWhat Is ESUN?\nESUN is a new workstream within the OCP Networking Project. It functions as an open technical forum where industry operators and leading vendors can collaborate to advance the use of Ethernet technology. The specific goal of ESUN is to leverage and adapt the mature Ethernet ecosystem to meet the unique, high-performance demands of the scale-up domain within modern AI systems.\nESUN is focused specifically on the network functionality aspect of scale-up systems. The workstream is designed to address the technical challenges related to how data traffic is managed and transmitted across network switches. This includes defining best practices and standards for:\nProtocol headers\nError handling mechanisms\nAchieving lossless data transfer across the network\nThe initiative brings together operators, vendors, and standards bodies to:\nCollaborate on Ethernet solutions tailored for scale-up networking.\nFocus on Ethernet framing and switching layers to ensure robust, lossless, and error-resilient multi-hop topologies.\nAlign with open standards by working closely with organizations like UEC and IEEE.\nMeta’s Contributions to ESUN\nMeta is proud to be among the initial group of OCP members driving ESUN, alongside industry leaders that includes: AMD, Arista, ARM, Broadcom, Cisco, HPE, Marvell, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Oracle. \nOur contributions include:\nTechnical leadership in defining the requirements for ESUN in AI clusters.\nOpen collaboration with vendors and standards bodies to ensure that solutions are interoperable and not tied to proprietary technologies.\nSharing best practices and lessons learned from deploying advanced Ethernet fabrics in Meta’s own data centers., \nAn Industry Invitation: Join the Open Future\nDriving progress in AI requires data center infrastructure that delivers more than just scale — it must also be flexible, efficient, and sustainable. At Meta, we envision a future where AI hardware systems are not only highly scalable, but also open and collaborative, enabling rapid innovation and adaptation to evolving workloads.\nWe invite engineers, developers, and industry partners to join us and the OCP community in shaping the next generation of networking hardware for AI. By working together and sharing ideas, we can accelerate the development of open, future-ready AI infrastructure that benefits the entire industry and supports the demands of tomorrow’s technologies.\nThe post OCP Summit 2025: The Open Future of Networking Hardware for AI appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The State of PHP 2025 examines how developers use, prefer, and rely on PHP, showing how this long-standing web language continues to modernize through new frameworks, improved tooling, and AI-assisted workflows.\nIn this report, we present findings from the Developer Ecosystem Survey 2025. Alongside the numbers, you’ll also hear commentary from Brent Roose, JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP, and insights from other community experts explaining what’s shaping PHP today and where the ecosystem is heading.\nIf you’d like to see what the ecosystem looked like just a year ago, check out the State of PHP 2024.\nParticipants\nThis year, we collected responses from 1,720 developers who indicated PHP as their main programming language, with the largest populations living in Japan, the United States, Russia, China, and France.\n\n\n\n\n88% of PHP developers have more than three years of experience, with the largest single group falling in the six-to-ten-year range.\n\n\n\n\nTeam size and work environment\nMore than half of PHP developers (56%) work in small teams of two to seven people, while 12% work independently.\n\n\n\n\nLanguage adoption and usage\nThe majority of PHP developers (58%) do not plan to migrate to other languages in the next year. For those who do, Go and Python are the most attractive alternatives.\n\n\n\n\nThe share of newcomers is slowly growing: 4% have been using PHP for less than six months (up from 2% last year), and 6% for less than one year. Still, almost three-quarters (72%) of developers report over four years of PHP usage, underlining the ecosystem’s maturity.\n“Important to note is that these numbers aren’t talking about people leaving PHP – they are about adopting languages besides PHP. I think it’s great to see so many PHP developers who are adding other languages to their toolbelt. PHP has areas where it shines, but there are also problems that are better solved with languages like Go or Rust. Working together across those language barriers leads to great results.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP\n                                    \n\n\n\n    \n“It’s great to see more newcomers in PHP. It’s not surprising given the amount of positive buzz around PHP for the past couple of years, but it’s nice to see the numbers proving this trend as well.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP\n                                    \nThe trend toward modernization continues: PHP 8.x dominates with 89% usage, while PHP 7.x has dropped to 33%. Legacy versions (5.6 and earlier) are now down to 8%, though not entirely gone. Read Brent’s blog post for a more in-depth analysis of PHP versions’ usage.\n“I think the open-source community plays a vital role in pushing the PHP community forward to adopt more secure and performant versions. The best part is that by using tools like Rector, upgrading becomes almost trivial. I speak from experience: The yearly upgrade is so well worth it.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP\n                                    \n\n\n\n\nPHP frameworks and CMSs\nNo major shifts occurred in framework adoption: Laravel continues to lead with 64% usage, followed by WordPress (25%) and Symfony (23%). Other frameworks like CodeIgniter, Yii, and CakePHP hold smaller but stable shares.\n\n\n\n    \n“We’re thrilled to see Laravel adoption continuing to grow, driven by innovations like Laravel Cloud and AI integrations such as Laravel Boost and MCP. Laravel remains focused on providing a comprehensive, modern full-stack solution that makes PHP development more productive and accessible than ever.”\n\n            \nTaylor Otwell\n                                                                Creator of Laravel\n                                    \n“Symfony contributors continue to push the boundaries of what can be expressed through type annotations, creating a virtuous cycle where codebases, static analyzers, and IDEs continuously improve to enhance developer experience and verifiability. Informal communication channels between all stakeholders make this progress even smoother and more efficient.”\n\n            \nNicolas Grekas\n                                                                Core Developer at Symfony\n                                    \nPHP development environments\nMost used IDE or editor\nOne of the most striking changes is in tooling: The share of those using either PhpStorm or IntelliJ IDEA with the PHP plugin has gone up by 10 percentage points, to 68%. Visual Studio Code’s share has dropped to 23%, while new players like Cursor (6%) have also entered the scene.\n\n\n\n\nSatisfaction with coding tools\nWe also asked PHP developers how satisfied they are with their primary IDE. Among them, 53% of PhpStorm users gave their IDE the highest possible rating, compared to just 26% of VS Code users.\n\n\n\n\nIDE or editor of choice per framework\nPhpStorm dominates in Symfony (83%) and leads in Laravel (62%), while WordPress developers remain more split, with VS Code remaining a popular choice (37%).\n\n\n\n\nDid you know Laravel support is now free for all PhpStorm users? This blog post has the full story.\nDebugging and testing\nWhen it comes to debugging, most developers still rely on var_dump-style approaches (59%), though debugger adoption (e.g. Xdebug) has risen slightly to 39%.\n\n\n\n    \n“Xdebug’s usage seems to be pretty stable throughout the years and across several surveys: between 30% and 35%. While I definitely still do my fair share of “dd” or “log” debugging, there are times where having a debugger at hand and knowing how to use it saves so much time. It’s a skill that takes practicing and doesn’t come overnight – which is why I made this short video to help folks get started with Xdebug.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP\n                                    \nPHPUnit (50%) remains the standard, but Pest adoption has gained four percentage points to reach 17%, showing momentum toward modern, developer-friendly testing frameworks.\n“I’m super-happy to see more and more people choosing Pest as their go-to testing framework – the growth in this year’s survey really reflects the quality of our recent releases.\n\r\n\r\nSince the survey, we’ve actually released Pest 4, which introduces test sharding, profanity checking, and the revolutionary browser testing. Having proper browser testing in the PHP world is truly a game-changer, so I expect adoption to increase even more next year!”\n\n            \nNuno Maduro\n                                                                Creator of Pest\n                                    \n\n\n\n\nHowever, 32% of developers still don’t write tests at all, which highlights a persistent gap in testing culture.\nCode quality tools\nThe clear winner in 2025 is PHPStan, which jumped to 36% usage, up nine percentage points from last year. Tools like PHP CS Fixer (30%) and PHP_CodeSniffer (22%) remain widely used, while Rector (10%) continues its steady rise. Still, 42% of respondents don’t use any code quality tools regularly, leaving room for further improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡Have you tried JetBrains Qodana? This static analysis and codebase auditing tool brings inspections from PhpStorm into your CI/CD pipeline, along with unique and custom code-quality and security checks. Use it to clean up and secure your team’s code before merging to the main branch.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdoption of AI\nAI has gone mainstream: 95% of developers have tried at least one AI tool, and 80% regularly use AI assistants or AI-powered editors.\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT leads daily use with 49%, though its share has dropped since 2024. GitHub Copilot (29%) and JetBrains AI Assistant (20%) follow, with the latter tripling its adoption since last year.\n\n\n\n    \n“AI is here to stay. It’s great to see the increased adoption of AI overall, and the drop in ChatGPT usage in favor of more specialized tooling. We can expect more of this moving forward, with new tools entering the scene, and the ones giving us the best boost earning their place in our daily stack.”\n\n            \nAshley Hindle\n                                                                AI Engineer at Laravel\n                                    \nLooking ahead, 72% of respondents are likely to try AI coding agents in the next year, while only 8% say it’s unlikely.\n\n\n\n\nTo support developers in this shift, earlier this year JetBrains introduced an AI coding agent called Junie. Unlike other coding assistants, Junie is built to work directly with your JetBrains IDE, project context, and team practices, delivering actionable and trustworthy support. With AI agents rapidly becoming part of everyday workflows, Junie brings the reliability, integration, and developer focus you expect from JetBrains to this new wave of tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time, not every company is ready to embrace AI yet. 11% respondents report that their organization is unlikely to try AI coding agents in the next 12 months. Apart from the data privacy and security concerns (44%) and intellectual property questions (24%), many companies also struggle with a lack of knowledge about such tools (22%).\nEcosystem highlights 2025\nFrankenPHP\n“One of my personal highlights in PHP this year is FrankenPHP becoming a  project backed by the PHP Foundation. I think there’s a lot of potential for the project to become the de-facto standard runtime for PHP, which would be huge. FrankenPHP has a lot of performance optimizations that work out of the box for any PHP application, it’s portable across systems, and it has worker mode, which allows for asynchronous request handling in PHP, which can speed up applications by a factor of three compared to using PHP FPM.”\n\n            \nBrent Roose\n                                                                JetBrains Developer Advocate for PHP\n                                    \nLearn more about FrankenPHP from Kévin Dunglas on PHPverse 2025:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPHPverse\nThis year also marked a special milestone – PHP turned 30 years old. We celebrated with JetBrains PHPverse, an online birthday event that drew more than 26,000 viewers worldwide. If you missed it, don’t worry – the recordings are available to watch on demand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCatch the next edition of PHPverse – sign up here to be the first to know when registration opens.\nGet event updates\n                                                    \nWhat this means for PHP\nThe 2025 results confirm that PHP remains a stable, professional, and evolving ecosystem. Its strong developer base, continued dominance of Laravel and WordPress, increasing adoption of modern tooling, and rapid embrace of AI-powered workflows show that PHP is far from being “legacy”.\nDisclaimer: Despite all the measures we’ve taken to secure a representative pool of respondents, these results might be slightly skewed toward users of JetBrains products, as they might have been more likely to take the survey.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Every year, the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey takes a deep dive into the world of software development, looking at how developers work, what tools they use, and how the industry is changing. \nThe survey has been running since 2017 and has since grown into one of the most comprehensive studies of its kind.\nThe 2025 edition is based on responses from 24,534 developers across 194 countries, offering a truly global overview of the profession.\nLet’s explore what stood out the most in 2025.\nAI proficiency is becoming a core skill\nAI is becoming a standard in developers’ lives: 85% of developers regularly use AI tools for coding and development, and 62% rely on at least one AI coding assistant, agent, or code editor.\nStill, 15% of developers have not yet adopted AI tools in their daily work. Whether their hesitancy is due to skepticism, security concerns, or mere personal preference, this significant minority represents an interesting opposition to the mainstream trend.\nAI at the workplace\nFor the majority who have embraced AI, the benefits are tangible. Nearly nine out of ten developers save at least an hour every week, and one in five saves eight hours or more. That’s the equivalent of an entire workday!\n\n\n\n\nThere’s no wonder 68% expect employers to require proficiency in AI tools in the near future. AI work has already become as common as data processing (25% vs. 29%).\nLooking to the future\nWhen asked about the increasing role of AI in society, developers express a mix of optimism, curiosity, and anxiety.\n\n\n\n\nMost developers are happy to let AI handle repetitive tasks, such as generating boilerplate code, writing documentation, or summarizing changes, but they prefer to stay in charge of creative and complex tasks, like debugging or designing application logic.\nHere are the top five development activities that respondents are most likely to delegate to AI:\nWriting boilerplate, repetitive code\nSearching for development-related information on the internet\nConverting code to other languages\nWriting code comments or code documentation\nSummarizing recent code changes\nBiggest concerns around AI in coding and software development\nDespite the enthusiasm surrounding AI, many people still have reservations. Here are the top five concerns our respondents reported having about AI in software development:\nThe inconsistent quality of AI-generated code\nAI tools’ limited understanding of complex code and logic\nPrivacy and security risks\nThe potential negative impact on their own coding and development skills\nAI’s lack of context awareness\nLanguages and tools\nThe programming languages that developers choose reveal the state of the industry and which technologies are gaining traction now.\nTypeScript has seen the most dramatic rise in real-world usage over the past five years. Rust, Go, and Kotlin have also continued to steadily amass market share – although their gains have not been quite as impressive as TypeScript’s.\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, PHP, Ruby, and Objective-C continue to decline steadily, reflecting how developer preferences and project demands have shifted over time.\nThe JetBrains Language Promise Index ranks languages based on growth, stability, and developers’ willingness to adopt them. According to the index, in 2025, TypeScript, Rust, and Go boast the highest perceived growth potential, while JavaScript, PHP, and SQL appear to have reached their maturity plateau.\nThe top five languages that developers want to adopt next are:\nGo (11%)\nRust (10%)\nPython (7%)\nKotlin (6%)\nTypeScript (6%)\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, Scala leads among the top-paid developers with 38%, despite being used by only 2% of all developers as a primary language. Sometimes, it seems, niche expertise quite literally pays off. You can explore this phenomenon in more detail with our IT Salary Calculator.\nIn the world of cloud services, regional providers maintain a strong presence in their home countries, showing that developers often choose cloud providers based on where they work or what’s most available in their region.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper productivity: Rethinking what it means to be productive\nLast year, companies focused almost exclusively on measuring technical performance – build time, velocity, and mean time to recovery.\nIn 2025, we have seen a major rebalancing. It’s no longer about DORA metrics – it’s developer productivity that now matters most.\nDevelopers themselves highlight both technical (51%) and non-technical (62%) factors as critical to their performance. Internal collaboration, communication, and clarity are now just as important as faster CI pipelines or better IDEs.\nWhile tech decision-makers dream of reducing technical debt and improving collaboration, developers want transparency, constructive feedback, and clarity of goals. Yet, 66% of developers don’t believe current metrics reflect their true contributions.\n\n\n\n\nThe data suggests it’s time to rethink how we measure success and to build work environments that reward not just results, but the way they’re achieved.\nFor more on how teams are reimagining productivity and developer experience, explore The State of Developer Experience and Productivity 2025 by JetBrains.\nDeveloper reality\nEvery developer’s work tells its own story, and the data highlights just how diverse those stories can be.\nGlobally, developers experience the job market in strikingly different ways: 57% describe it as “favorable” in Japan, while 66% find it “challenging” in Canada. The industry may be global, but opportunity still depends on where you are.\n61% of junior developers find the job market challenging, while 54% of senior developers share this concern.\nAs developers progress in their careers, they face entirely different types of challenges. The data shows a clear transformation from technical focus to coordination responsibilities, such as context switching, as experience increases. \nDespite all the challenges, developers love what they do: 52% of developers code for fun even after coding all day. 57% prefer to do it while listening to music, while 25% enjoy the quiet. \nAnd in one of the most delightful constants of this survey: Developers love cats just as much as dogs! 🐱 🐶\nMethodology\nThe survey ran from April to June 2025 and included 24,534 developers after data cleaning. We balanced our responses by geography, employment, programming languages, and JetBrains product use.\nWrapping up\nThe Developer Ecosystem Survey 2025 results reveal a field that’s changing fast, shaped by AI and growing self-awareness among developers. They’re using tools that make them more productive, while questioning how they define productivity in the changing landscape.\nExplore the full data and uncover your own insights using the Developer Ecosystem Data Playground.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "ReSharper for Visual Studio Code has been available on the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace for some time now.\n\n\n\n\nHowever, ReSharper didn’t appear in many VS Code-compatible editors because these editors aren’t able to connect directly to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace. For this reason, users of such editors who wanted to install ReSharper had to download a platform-specific .vsix file and perform manual updates every time a new version was released. To make matters worse, a lack of update notifications meant that these users were often using outdated versions of the extension. This process was neither straightforward nor convenient. \nReSharper on the Open VSX Registry\nTo better serve our Cursor, Windsurf, and VSCodium users, we decided to publish our extension on the Open VSX Registry, which has become the default marketplace for VS Code-compatible editors.\nOn October 14, we published ReSharper to the Open VSX Registry. You can now easily install ReSharper in your VS Code-compatible code editor by simply typing ReSharper into the search field in the Extensions view. \n\n\n\n\nCursor users might have noticed that ReSharper was already searchable in the Extensions view before it was published to the Open VSX Registry. This is thanks to the Cursor team’s custom implementation, which enabled ReSharper to reach Cursor users ahead of the official release on Open VSX.\nIf your code editor does not use the Open VSX Registry as its default marketplace, you can manually download the extension from this web page.\n\n\n\n\nWe hope this will make accessing ReSharper code analysis in your code editor more convenient and improve your C# development experience.\nNew extension architecture\nWe intended to deliver ReSharper to the Open VSX Registry earlier, but we encountered a technical limitation – the registry requires that a published binary of an extension cannot exceed 256 MB in size. Unfortunately, the .vsix file for Windows ARM64 was 275 MB. While other platform-specific binaries were slightly below the limit, we anticipate that they will soon exceed the size restriction.\nTo address this issue, we decided to redesign the extension’s architecture and create a light core extension that will download larger components, such as the ReSharper language server and .NET runtime, directly from the JetBrains download server on first launch.\nUnfortunately, there are a couple of downsides to this architectural change: \nThe initial startup of the newly updated extension will take longer than before, as larger components will need to be downloaded and unzipped. However, this impact is minimal, and subsequent startups will not experience any delays.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need an active internet connection and unrestricted access to the https://download.jetbrains.com server when opening the first .NET solution with the updated ReSharper extension. Once the download is complete, the extension will remain fully functional even without an internet connection. If you do not meet these requirements, the ReSharper extension will notify you and provide a link to download a platform-specific .vsix file that contains all the necessary components for offline installation.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any comments or questions regarding this architectural change, please reach out to us via our public issue tracker or the comments section of this blog post.",

LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX의 이해\nWayland를 사용하는 최근의 리눅스에서는 LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX를 이용해서 터치 공간의 픽셀 위치를 조정(calibration) 할 수 있다. 이 값은 총 9개의 매트릭스로 되어있으며 각각은 아래와 같다.\nlibinput calibrtion matrix\n\n\n여기서 터치 스크린용으로 사용되는 값은 M11, M12, M13, M21, M22, M23의 6개이며 각각은 아래와 같은 의미를 가진다.\nM11\nX축 배율(scaling), 입력된 X좌표에 곱해져서 최종 X좌표를 구한다. 예를 들어 0.5면 좌표의 위치가 절반으로 줄어드는 효과를 가진다.\n\n\nM12\nX좌표의 Y의존성(Skew/Rotation). 화면이 로테이션이 된 경우에 보정하는 값이다.\n\n\nM13\nX축 오프셋(offset), X좌표에 시작위치이다. 0이면 이동이 없는 것을 의미한다.\n\n\nM21\nY좌표의 X의존성(Skew/Rotation). 화면이 로테이션이 된 경우에 보정하는 값이다.\n\n\nM22\nY축 배율(scaling), 입력된 Y좌표에 곱해져서 최종 Y좌표를 구한다. 예를 들어 1이면 좌표를 변화시키지 않는다.\n\n\nM23\nY축 오프셋(Offset), Y좌표의 시작위치이다.\n\n\nM31\n투시 변환(Perspective), 일반적으로 0이다. 이 값들은 건드리지 않는다.(뭔지는 자세히 모른다)\n\n\nM32\n투시 변환(Perspective), 일반적으로 0이다. 이 값들은 건드리지 않는다.(뭔지는 자세히 모른다)\n\n\nM33\n투시 변환(Perspective), 일반적으로 1이다. 이 값들은 건드리지 않는다.(뭔지는 자세히 모른다)\n\n\n\n예를 들어 2개의 모니터가 있고, 각각 2560x1600의 해상도를 가진다고 가정하자. 모니터1이 일반 모니터이고, 모니터2가 Zeuslab의 P16KT 터치 모니터이다. 그리고 P16KT가 좌측에 배치되어있다고 가정하자.\n이런 경우 전체 화면 크기는 5120x1600의 화면 크기를 가진다. 그리고 좌측 상단의 X,Y좌표는 (0,0)이고 2560x1600이므로 절반만 사용하는 셈이다. 따라서 M11은 0.5를 넣고, Y축 크기는 둘다 1600이므로 배율을 변화시킬 필요가 없으므로 M22는 1이다. 따라서 LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX는 다음과 같다.\nLIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX=\"0.5 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\"\n이 값을 적용시킬려면 udev의 rules 파일로 만드는 것이 좋다. 파일을 만들 디렉터리 경로는 /etc/udev/rules.d 이며, 파일명은 98-zeuslab-p16kt-libinput-calibration.rules 정도로 만들자. 사실 파일명은 다르게 해도 상관은 없다. 보통 앞의 숫자 2개와 파일 내용을 설명하는 적당한 이름이면 된다. 이것도 당연히 root 권한으로 파일을 생성해야만 한다. 내용은 아래 1줄짜리를 넣어두면 된다.\nACTION==\"add|change\", SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"0457\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0819\", ENV{LIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX}=\"0.5 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1\"\n보통은 rules 파일을 새로 넣으면 곧바로 적용되지만 기존 파일을 수정했거나, 혹여 로딩이 잘 안되는 경우가 있기 때문에 아래처럼 수동으로 이벤트를 발생시키는 것을 권장한다. 당연히 root로 명령한다. --name 의 장치명은 앞서 libinput에서 알아낸 파일명을 쓰면 된다. 혹시라도 이벤트가 제대로 작동하는지 확인하고 싶다면 미리 터미널 창을 하나 더 열고 udevadm monitor --environment --udev 명령을 내려두면 모니터링을 할 수 있다.\n$ sudo udevadm control --reload && udevadm trigger --name=/dev/input/event26\n보통 명령이 내려지면 바로 적용되는 경우도 있지만 때에 따라서는 10여분 가까이 걸리기도 한다. 왜 그런지는 잘 모르겠다. 적용이 제대로 되었는지는 libinput list-devices ... 명령에서 \"Calibration\" 항목을 보면 된다.\n \n3. 화면의 크기가 다른 모니터 사용시\n두 화면의 크기가 다른 모니터를 사용하는 경우에는 X, Y 좌표의 값이 달라지기 때문에 계산이 조금 복잡해진다. 예를 들어  모니터1번이 3840x2160, 모니터2번이 P16KT(2560x1600)이라면 논리적인 좌표값은 최대값을 따르기 때문에 토탈 화면 크기는 6400x2160이 된다. 이런 경우에는 M11, M13, M22의 좌표 계산이 약간 골치아파지기 때문에 이를 계산해주는 bash script를 하나 작성했다 (copilot을 이용해서 기본적인 뼈대를 작성하고, 오류가 있어서 약간 수정을 했다.)\n#!/bin/bash\n# 아래 1번, 2번 모니터의 설정을 본인의 화면에 맞게 수정한다.\n### 설정 시작 ###\n# 1. 모니터 설정 (물리적 픽셀 및 배율)\n# 1번 모니터 (주 모니터)\nMONITOR1_P_WIDTH=5120\nMONITOR1_P_HEIGHT=2160\nMONITOR1_SCALE=1.5 # 150%\n\n# 2번 모니터 (터치 모니터)\nMONITOR2_P_WIDTH=2560\nMONITOR2_P_HEIGHT=1600\nMONITOR2_SCALE=1.0 # 100% 가정 (필요에 따라 1.25, 1.5 등으로 변경 가능)\n### 설정 끝 ###\n\n# 터치 입력을 적용할 2번 모니터의 위치\nTARGET=\"$1\"\nif [[ \"$TARGET\" != \"left\" && \"$TARGET\" != \"right\" ]];

(명령 후 실제 효과는 10여분까지 지연될 수 있음을 명심하자)\n만일 오른쪽에 배치된 경우라면 right를 명령을 하면 된다.\n$ ./libinput_calibration_matrix.sh right\nMonitor[1] : Logical width x height = 3413.3333 x 1440.0000\nMonitor[2] : Logical width x height = 2560.0000 x 1600.0000\nLIBINPUT_CALIBRATION_MATRIX=\".4285 0 .5714 0 1.0000 0 0 0 1\"\n \n혹시라도 아예 터치 기능을 비활성화 하고자 한다면 예전에 써둔 글이 있으니 그것을 참고하기 바란다.\n2025.06.23 - [컴퓨터 관련/리눅스 데스크탑] - 리눅스에서 제우스랩 P16KT 터치 기능 끄기\n히스토리\n2025-10-12 초안 작성\n \n레퍼런스\nCalibrating Touchscreen, Arch Linux wiki, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Calibrating_Touchscreen\nHow to calibrate touch screen on Wayland, https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/708447/how-to-calibrate-touch-screen-on-wayland",

Fast-dLLM이 기반하는 Masked Diffusion Model (MDM)은 [MASK] 토큰으로 가득 찬 시퀀스에서 시작하여, 여러 번의 정제(refinement) 단계를 거쳐 전체 문장을 완성한다5. 이 과정에서 디코더는 문장 전체의 맥락을 파악해야 하므로 양방향(Bidirectional) 어텐션을 사용한다.<br /><br />이처럼 두 모델은 디코더의 동작 방식이 근본적으로 다르므로, 논문의 아키텍처를 그대로 이식하는 대신 학습 및 추론 과정을 시뮬레이션하는 방식으로 접근해야 한다.<br /><br /><b>Diffusion의 학습법: Masked Language Modeling</b><br />Diffusion 모델의 학습 목표는 노이즈가 낀 데이터에서 원본 데이터를 복원하는, 이른바 \"Denoising\" 과정이다. 텍스트 분야에서는 이 노이즈를 [MASK] 토큰으로 대체하여 구현한다. 이는 BERT의 MASK 방식 학습 아이디어와 유사해 보인다.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

모델의 가중치가 너무 커지는 것을 방지하여 과적합을 억제하는 가중치 감쇠(Weight Decay)와 같은 다른 보편적인 정규화 기법이 부재할 수 있다. 부족한 정규화는 모델이 제한된 훈련 데이터의 패턴을 더 빠르고 쉽게 암기하도록 만들어 과적합을 가속화하는 요인으로 작용한다.<br /><br />이러한 문제들을 해결하고 모델을 안정적으로 훈련시키기 위한 방안은 다음과 같다.<br /><br />1. 데이터셋 교체 및 증강<br />실제 대용량 데이터셋을 사용해야 한다. 예를 들어, 허깅페이스에 공개된 데이터셋은 수만 개 이상의 문장 쌍으로 구성되어 있어, 모델이 일반화된 언어 패턴을 학습하는 데 필수적이다.<br /><br /></span></div><div><span>데이터셋을 교체할 수 없는 제한된 환경이라면, 데이터 증강(Data Augmentation)을 통해 훈련 샘플을 인위적으로 늘리는 방법을 고려할 수 있다. 하지만 현재 데이터의 절대량이 너무 적어 그 효과는 매우 제한적일 가능성이 높다.<br /><br />2. 검증 루프 및 조기 종료 구현<br />과적합을 방지하고 훈련 효율성을 높이기 위해 검증 및 조기 종료 로직을 도입 한다. 이는 가장 표준적이고 효과적인 방법이다.<span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38;

Fast-dLLM이 기반하는 Masked Diffusion Model (MDM)은 [MASK] 토큰으로 가득 찬 시퀀스에서 시작하여, 여러 번의 정제(refinement) 단계를 거쳐 전체 문장을 완성한다5. 이 과정에서 디코더는 문장 전체의 맥락을 파악해야 하므로 양방향(Bidirectional) 어텐션을 사용한다.\n이처럼 두 모델은 디코더의 동작 방식이 근본적으로 다르므로, 논문의 아키텍처를 그대로 이식하는 대신 학습 및 추론 과정을 시뮬레이션하는 방식으로 접근해야 한다.\nDiffusion의 학습법: Masked Language Modeling\nDiffusion 모델의 학습 목표는 노이즈가 낀 데이터에서 원본 데이터를 복원하는, 이른바 \"Denoising\" 과정이다. 텍스트 분야에서는 이 노이즈를 [MASK] 토큰으로 대체하여 구현한다. 이는 BERT의 MASK 방식 학습 아이디어와 유사해 보인다.\n\n기존 AR 트랜스포머가 이 Denoising 능력을 학습하도록 데이터셋을 수정해야 한다. 타겟 문장의 일부를 랜덤하게 [MASK] 토큰으로 교체하고, 모델이 이 마스킹된 문장을 입력받아 원본 문장 전체를 예측하도록 학습 목표를 설정하는 것이다. 주요 구현을 의사코드로 확인해 보겠다.\n\n\nclass MaskedSeq2SeqDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, pairs: List[Tuple[str, str]], src_tok: Tokenizer, tgt_tok: Tokenizer, max_len: int = 40):\n        self.pairs = pairs\n        self.src_tok, self.tgt_tok = src_tok, tgt_tok\n        self.max_len = max_len\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        src_txt, tgt_txt = self.pairs[idx]\n        src_ids = self.src_tok.encode(src_txt, add_eos=True)[:self.max_len]\n        tgt_ids = self.tgt_tok.encode(tgt_txt, add_sos=True, add_eos=True)[:self.max_len]\n        \n        # 코사인 스케줄에 따라 마스킹할 개수 결정 (개념적인 시간 t에 해당)\n        t_rand = random.random()\n        num_to_mask = math.ceil(len(tgt_ids) * math.cos(t_rand * math.pi / 2))\n        \n        masked_tgt_ids = list(tgt_ids)\n        maskable_indices = [i for i, t_id in enumerate(tgt_ids) if t_id not in (self.tgt_tok.sos_id, self.tgt_tok.eos_id)]\n        \n        if len(maskable_indices) > 0 and num_to_mask > 0:\n            indices_to_mask = random.sample(maskable_indices, min(num_to_mask, len(maskable_indices)))\n            for i in indices_to_mask:\n                masked_tgt_ids[i] = self.tgt_tok.mask_id\n\n        return (torch.tensor(src_ids, dtype=torch.long),\n                torch.tensor(masked_tgt_ids, dtype=torch.long),\n                torch.tensor(tgt_ids, dtype=torch.long))\n\n\n논문은 여러 토큰을 동시에 예측할 때 발생하는 품질 저하의 원인을 조건부 독립 가정(conditional independence assumption)으로 지적한다. 즉, 모델이 각 토큰의 확률을 독립적으로 계산하여 샘플링하기 때문에 \"high card\"나 \"full house\" 대신 \"high house\"와 같은 부자연스러운 조합이 생성될 수 있다는 것이다.\n이에 대한 해결책으로 Confidence-Aware Parallel Decoding 전략을 제안한다. 이 전략은 모델이 예측한 확률 값, 즉 '자신감(confidence)'이 특정 임계값(threshold)을 넘는 토큰들만 선택적으로 예측하고, 나머지는 다음 스텝에서 다시 예측하도록 남겨두는 방식이다.\n또한 추론 과정을 여러 블록(block)으로 나누어 점진적으로 생성하는 Block-wise Generation 방식을 채택했다. \n\n\n이를 논문에서는 다음과 같은 알고리즘으로 기술했다. \n\n\n\n\n\n이런 논문의 아이디어를 종합하여 구현한 추론 함수는 다음과 같다.\n\n\n@torch.no_grad()\ndef fast_dllm_decode(\n    model: NARTransformer,\n    src_tensor: torch.Tensor,\n    src_text: str,\n    tgt_tok: Tokenizer,\n    max_len: int,\n    num_blocks: int = 2,\n    steps_per_block: int = 12,\n    confidence_threshold: float = 0.9,\n    visualize: bool = False,\n):\n    # ...

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE TABLE 등 그 문법이 SQL과 매우 유사하여, 기존 관계형 데이터베이스(RDBMS)에 익숙한 개발자가 쉽게 배울 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 이는 의도적으로 설계된 부분이다.<br /><br />겉모습은 비슷하지만, 내부 동작 원리와 데이터 모델링 철학은 완전히 다르다. 카산드라는 관계형 데이터베이스가 아니다. 가장 큰 차이점은 다음과 같다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>카산드라는 여러 테이블을 연결하는 JOIN 연산을 지원하지 않는다. 이는 분산 환경에서 JOIN이 유발하는 막대한 성능 저하를 원천적으로 차단하기 위함이다.</span></li><li><span>외래 키(Foreign Key)와 같은 관계 무결성을 데이터베이스 차원에서 보장하지 않는다.</span></li><li><span>RDBMS가 데이터의 관계를 정규화하여 모델링하는 반면, 카산드라는 애플리케이션이 사용할 쿼리(조회 방식)를 먼저 설계하고 그에 맞춰 테이블을 비정규화(denormalization)하여 구성한다.</span></li></ul>결론적으로, CQL은 SQL의 편리한 문법을 차용한, 분산 Key-Value 데이터 저장소에 최적화된 전혀 다른 언어이다.</span></div><div><span><br />3. 개발자가 카산드라를 선택하는 이유<br />개발자들은 RDBMS가 해결하기 어려운 특정 문제들을 풀기 위해 카산드라를 선택한다.</span></div><div><span><br />가. 분산 아키텍처와 수평적 확장성 (Horizontal Scalability)<br />이것이 카산드라를 사용하는 가장 큰 이유이다. 카산드라는 여러 서버(노드)를 묶어 하나의 거대한 데이터베이스처럼 사용하는 'Shared-Nothing' 분산 아키텍처를 기반으로 한다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>수평적 확장: 데이터가 늘어나거나 트래픽이 증가할 때, 고가의 단일 서버 성능을 높이는 '수직적 확장'이 아니라, 저렴한 일반 서버를 클러스터에 계속 추가하는 '수평적 확장'이 가능하다. 이론적으로 서버를 추가하는 만큼 성능과 용량이 선형적으로 증가한다.</span></li><li><span>대규모 데이터 처리: 수십억, 수백억 개의 행을 가진 페타바이트(PB)급 데이터를 처리하는 데 최적화되어 있다.</span></li></ul></span></div><div><span>나. 고가용성 및 장애 허용 (High Availability &amp; Fault Tolerance)<br />카산드라 클러스터에는 마스터(Master) 노드처럼 특별한 역할을 하는 노드가 없어 단일 장애점(SPOF, Single Point of Failure)이 존재하지 않는다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>데이터 복제: 데이터는 클러스터 내 여러 노드에 자동으로 복제되어 저장된다.</span></li><li><span>무중단 서비스: 특정 노드에 장애가 발생하더라도, 복제된 데이터를 가진 다른 노드가 즉시 요청을 처리하여 서비스 중단 없이 운영이 가능하다. 이는 24시간 365일 무중단이 필수적인 서비스에 결정적인 장점이다.</span></li></ul>다. 압도적인 쓰기 성능<br />카산드라는 LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) 라는 자료 구조를 사용하여 데이터를 저장한다. 이는 디스크에 데이터를 순차적으로 추가(Append-Only)하는 방식으로, 기존 RDBMS의 B-Tree 방식보다 쓰기 작업에 훨씬 유리하다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>활용 사례: 사물 인터넷(IoT) 센서 데이터, 서비스 로그, 메시징 데이터처럼 끊임없이 대량으로 쏟아지는 데이터를 지연 없이 저장해야 하는 시스템에 최적이다.</span></li></ul></span></div><div><span>4. 실제 구현 사례 - 온톨로지 모델의 객체 저장소<br />앞서 구현한 온톨로지 모델은 카산드라의 장점을 활용한 전형적인 데이터 아키텍처로 적용 가능하다.</span></div><div><span><br />가. 아키텍처 장점<br />이 시스템은 두 가지 데이터베이스를 조합하여 각자의 장점을 극대화한다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>객체 저장소 (카산드라): 모든 객체의 원본 데이터를 저장하는 'Source of Truth' 역할을 한다.</span></li><li><span>검색 인덱스 (엘라스틱서치): 카산드라에 저장된 데이터를 복사하여, 복잡한 검색 및 집계 기능을 제공한다.</span></li></ul>나. 카산드라의 역할<br />온톨로지 모델의 객체 저장소로 카산드라를 선택할 때 좋은 이유는 다음과 같다.<br /><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li><span>Key-Value 최적화: 온톨로지 객체는 고유 ID를 Key로, 속성 데이터를 Value로 갖는다. 이는 object_id를 파티션 키로 사용하는 카산드라의 데이터 모델과 완벽하게 부합하며, ID 기반 조회 시 최고의 성능을 보장한다.</span></li><li><span>확장성: 수억, 수십억 개의 온톨로지 객체가 생성되더라도, 단순히 카산드라 클러스터에 노드를 추가하는 것만으로 시스템을 수평적으로 확장할 수 있다.</span></li><li><span>가용성: 온톨로지 데이터는 기업의 핵심 자산이다. 카산드라의 무중단 특성은 일부 노드에 장애가 발생해도 객체 데이터의 유실 없이 안정적으로 서비스를 유지할 수 있도록 보장한다.</span></li></ul>다. 구현 코드<br />다음은 카산드라와 엘라스틱서치를 사용하여 온톨로지 모델을 구현한 파이썬 코드이다. 이 코드는 위에서 설명한 아키텍처 원리를 추측해 구현해 본 것이다.</span></div><div><span><span style=\"font-size: x-small;\"><br /></span><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.38;

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 세계적으로 주목받고 있는 팔란티어(Palantir)의 온톨로지 플랫폼 아키텍처를 소프트웨어 공학 관점에서 분석하고, 오픈소스 기술을 활용한 구현 방법을 정리한다. 팔란티어의 핵심은 기존 시스템을 대체하는 것이 아니라, 통합하고 확장하는 개방성에 있다. 이 글은 팔란티어가 어떻게 검증된 오픈소스 기술 기반 위에 독자적인 온톨로지(Ontology)라는 의미론적 추상화 계층을 구축했는지, 그리고 그 구조를 파헤쳐 본다.\n\n\n\n팔란티어 아키텍처의 핵심 철학 - 개방과 통합\n팔란티어 아키텍처의 근간에는 '대체가 아닌 통합'이라는 철학이 있다. 이는 기업이 이미 막대한 투자를 한 데이터 레이크, ERP, CRM과 같은 기존 IT 환경을 교체하는 대신, 이들을 하나로 묶고 그 가치를 증대시키는 플랫폼 역할을 하는 것이다.\n\n이러한 철학은 아키텍처의 명확한 관심사 분리로 이어진다. 배포, 오케스트레이션, 데이터 처리와 같은 하위 계층은 의도적으로 쿠버네티스(Kubernetes), 스파크(Spark), 플링크(Flink) 등 보편적인 오픈소스 표준 위에 구축된다. 이를 통해 고객의 기존 기술 스택 및 엔지니어링 역량과 마찰 없이 통합된다. 반면, 온톨로지, AI 플랫폼(AIP)과 같은 상위 계층에는 팔란티어의 독자적인 지적 재산이 집중된다. 이 구조는 고객이 새로운 데이터베이스나 컴퓨팅 엔진이 아닌, 기존 자산과 상호 작용하는 새로운 패러다임을 구매하게 만들어 비지니스 가치를 제안한다.\n\n\n플랫폼의 안정성과 확장성은 두 가지 핵심 기술, 즉 자율 배포 시스템인 아폴로(Apollo)와 쿠버네티스 기반의 컨테이너 오케스트레이션 기판인 루빅스(Rubix)에 의해 뒷받침된다. 이 기반 위에서 데이터 통합 및 분석 플랫폼인 파운드리(Foundry), 국방 및 정보 분석에 특화된 고담(Gotham), 그리고 AI 모델을 온톨로지와 연결하는 AIP(Artificial Intelligence Platform)가 운영된다.\n\n팔란티어 아키텍처 구조 개념도\n\n\n데이터 처리 워크플로우 - 비정형 데이터에서 지식으로 변환\n팔란티어의 워크플로우는 이기종의 파편화된 데이터 소스를 연결하고, 이를 구조화된 지식으로 변환하여 온톨로지를 '활성화(Hydration)'하는 과정이다.\n\n\n데이터 수집 및 파싱\n\n\nPDF, 문서, 이미지와 같은 비정형 데이터는 먼저 '미디어 셋(media sets)'이라는 파일 모음으로 수집된다. 데이터를 파싱하는 과정은 블랙박스가 아니다. 개발자는 파이썬(Python)이나 자바(Java) 변환과 저수준 파일 시스템 API를 사용하여 직접 파이프라인을 구축한다. 이는 결정론적이고, 테스트 가능하며, 버전 관리가 가능한 파이프라인을 통해 신뢰성과 거버넌스를 확보하는 엔지니어링 중심의 접근 방식이다.\n\n\n\n\n\n더 나아가 AIP는 AI 기반 파싱 기능을 제공한다. 이는 사전 훈련되거나 맞춤화된 AI 모델(예: NLP 모델)을 파이프라인 내에 통합하여 개체명 인식, 요약과 같은 정교한 작업을 수행하는 방식이다. 이 구조는 엔지니어가 견고한 데이터 파이프라인을 구축하고, AI 엔지니어가 그 안에 두뇌 역할을 하는 모델을 배포하는 효율적인 이중 계층 시스템을 만든다.\n\n\n\n기반 처리 기술\n\n\n이러한 데이터 변환 및 통합 로직은 독점 엔진에 종속되지 않는다. 모든 데이터는 아파치 파케이(Apache Parquet), 아브로(Avro)와 같은 표준 형식으로 저장되며, 대규모 배치 처리를 위한 아파치 스파크, 실시간 스트림 처리를 위한 아파치 플링크와 같은 오픈소스 런타임을 사용한다.\n\n\n\n온톨로지 메타모델\n온톨로지는 팔란티어의 핵심 차별화 요소로, 기업의 모든 데이터, 모델, 프로세스를 현실 세계의 대응물(공장, 고객, 제품 등)과 연결하는 의미론적, 동역학적 계층이다. 이는 기업의 '디지털 트윈(digital twin)' 역할을 한다.\n\n\n온톨로지의 개념은 객체 지향 프로그래밍(OOP)과 매우 유사하다.\n\n객체(Object)는 클래스(Class)에 해당한다. 온톨로지의 '항공기' 객체 유형은 OOP의 Aircraft 클래스와 같다.\n속성(Property)은 속성(Attribute)에 해당한다. '항공기' 객체의 '꼬리 번호' 속성은 Aircraft 클래스의 tailNumber 속성과 같다.\n연결(Link)은 객체 간의 관계(Association)에 해당한다. '조종사'가 '항공기'에 탑승한다는 연결은 Pilot 객체와 Aircraft 객체 간의 관계를 정의한다.\n\n다음은 이를 역공학해본 온톨로지 메타모델 구조이다. \n\n\n팔란티어 온톨로지 메타모델(UML)\n\n\n본질적으로 온톨로지는 기업의 비즈니스 개념을 객체 지향 방식으로 모델링한 추상화 계층이다.\n\n\n\n\n온톨로지 작업 UI 메뉴\n\n\n\n\n플랫폼 아키텍처적 고려 - 디커플링(Decoupling)\n온톨로지의 가장 중요한 기능은 소스 데이터 시스템과 운영 애플리케이션 사이에 안정적인 추상화 계층을 제공하여 애플리케이션 계층을 데이터 계층과 분리(decouple)하는 것이다.\n\n\n일반적으로 애플리케이션은 ERP나 CRM 같은 소스 데이터베이스에 직접 연결된다. 만약 소스 시스템의 스키마가 변경되면 모든 종속 애플리케이션이 손상되어 막대한 기술 부채를 유발한다. 온톨로지는 중간 계층 역할을 한다. 애플리케이션은 원시 데이터 테이블이 아닌, 온톨로지의 안정적인 비즈니스 객체(예: '고객' 객체)를 기준으로 구축된다. 소스 시스템이 변경되더라도 '활성화' 파이프라인만 수정하면 되므로, 온톨로지 위에 구축된 수백 개의 운영 애플리케이션은 영향을 받지 않는다. 이는 사실상 온톨로지가 기업 전체 데이터에 대한 안정적인 API 역할을 수행하게 하여, 기업의 민첩성을 극적으로 높이고 유지보수 비용을 절감한다.\n\n\n클라이언트 앱 프로젝트 생성 UI 메뉴 \n \n\n온톨로지 메타모델 구현 방법\n팔란티어의 온톨로지는 마법이 아닌, 소프트웨어 공학적으로 설계된 데이터 모델링과 아키텍처 원칙의 조합이다. 이는 오픈소스 기술 스택으로 충분히 구현 가능한 구조이다.\n\n\n\n온톨로지의 요구사항은 특정 객체를 빠르게 조회하고, 객체 간의 복잡한 관계를 탐색하며, 대규모 데이터셋을 검색하는 것이다. 이를 만족시키기 위한 가장 가능성 높은 아키텍처는 단일 데이터베이스가 아닌, 여러 기술을 조합한 복합 아키텍처(Composite Architecture)이다.\n\n\n객체 저장소: 객체 데이터 자체는 카산드라(Cassandra)와 같은 수평적으로 확장 가능한 Key-Value 저장소에 저장될 수 있다. 각 객체는 고유 ID를 키(Key)로, 모든 속성을 담은 JSON 문서를 값(Value)으로 저장하는 방식이다.\n검색 및 그래프 인덱스: 빠른 검색, 집계, 그래프 탐색 기능을 위해서는 엘라스틱서치(Elasticsearch)나 루씬(Lucene) 기반의 검색 인덱스가 필수적이다. Key-Value 저장소에 저장된 객체 데이터는 검색 엔진으로 인덱싱되어 풍부한 쿼리 기능을 제공한다.\n\n이 구조에서 온톨로지는 기술적으로 레이블이 있는 속성 그래프(Labeled Property Graph, LPG) 모델로 구현된다. 객체는 '노드(Node)'가 되고, 연결은 '간선(Edge)'이 되며, 이는 확장성이 뛰어난 Key-Value 저장소와 검색 인덱스의 조합 위에 효율적으로 구축될 수 있다.\n\n\n온톨로지는 고객의 기존 MongoDB나 PostgreSQL을 대체하지 않는다. 대신 JDBC, ODBC와 같은 표준 커넥터를 통해 이들 시스템에 연결하고, 데이터를 가져와 온톨로지 모델로 '활성화'한다. 예를 들어, PostgreSQL의 여러 테이블을 조인하여 하나의 '제품' 객체를 생성하거나, MongoDB의 'customers' 컬렉션을 '고객' 객체로 매핑할 수 있다.\n\nSQL 질의문 예시\n\n\n온톨로지의 활용 - AI 에이전트와 애플리케이션\n완전히 활성화된 온톨로지는 AI 에이전트와 인간 운영자가 상호작용하는 기반이 된다(인간-AI 팀 개념 구현). AI 에이전트는 온톨로지라는 잘 구조화된 지식 그래프를 탐색하며 복잡한 추론을 수행한다. 예를 들어, \"배송 지연 위험이 있는 제품은 무엇인가?\"라는 질문에, 에이전트는 '제품'에서 '공급업체', '위험 점수'로 그래프 관계를 탐색하며 다각적인 답변을 생성할 수 있다.\n\n\n팔란티어의 인간-AI 팀 개념도\n\n\n\n개발자는 파이썬 OSDK(Ontology SDK) 등을 사용하여 온톨로지와 상호작용하는 애플리케이션을 구축한다. client.ontology.objects.Shipment.where(status=\"Delayed\").all()과 같은 코드는 SQL 쿼리보다 훨씬 직관적이며, 비즈니스 용어로 로직을 작성할 수 있게 해준다. 또한, 온톨로지에 정의된 '액션(Action)'을 호출하는 것은 단순한 데이터베이스 업데이트가 아니라, 플랫폼의 모든 거버넌스, 보안, 감사 추적이 적용되는 통제된 트랜잭션을 실행하는 것이다.\n\n\n팔란티어 앱 개발 방법 예시\n\n\n\n팔란티어 플랫폼 기반 앱 개발 예시\n개발자가 Palantir Foundry의 온톨로지 SDK(OSDK)를 사용하여 실제 운영 애플리케이션을 어떻게 구축하는지 살펴보는 것은 플랫폼의 가치를 이해하는 데 중요하다. 이 섹션에서는 가상의 물류 애플리케이션 시나리오를 통해 Python OSDK의 실제 코딩 예시를 제시한다.\n\n물류 회사는 매일 수천 건의 화물을 처리한다. '화물(Shipment)'과 '운송 차량(Vehicle)'이라는 두 가지 핵심 객체 유형이 온톨로지에 정의되어 있다고 가정하자. 물론, 이 온톨로지 객체 인스턴스들은 파서 파이프라인을 통해 데이터베이스에 구축된 상태이다. 팔란티어는 고객 데이터베이스에 온톨로지를 구축하기 위해 개발 컨설팅을 서비스한다. \n\n\n이 예제에서는 이 과정이 끝나고, 온톨로지 모델을 통해 접근할 수 있는 '화물' 객체에는 shipmentId, status (예: '운송 중', '지연', '배송 완료'), destination과 같은 속성이 있다. '운송 차량' 객체에는 vehicleId, currentLocation 속성이 있으며, 각 '화물'은 특정 '운송 차량'에 할당되어 온톨로지 상에서 연결(Link)되어 있다. 온톨로지를 여기서는 데이터베이스가 아닌 추상 레이어(미들웨어)라 가정해야 한다. 다음은 팔란티어 온톨로지 기반으로 정의된 사용자 모델이다.\n\n사용자 온톨로지 모델 구조(UML)\n우리의 목표는 '지연' 상태인 모든 화물을 식별하고, 운영자가 상태를 '조사 중'으로 변경할 수 있는 간단한 스크립트를 작성하는 것이다.\nFoundry 플랫폼은 개발자가 온톨로지와 직접 상호작용할 수 있는 언어별 SDK를 제공한다.37 Python OSDK는 객체, 속성, 액션을 마치 일반적인 Python 클래스와 메서드처럼 다룰 수 있게 해준다.\n\n\nimport os\nfrom <YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME> import FoundryClient\nfrom <YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>.core.api import UserTokenAuth\n\n# 1.

SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE TABLE 등 그 문법이 SQL과 매우 유사하여, 기존 관계형 데이터베이스(RDBMS)에 익숙한 개발자가 쉽게 배울 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 이는 의도적으로 설계된 부분이다.\n겉모습은 비슷하지만, 내부 동작 원리와 데이터 모델링 철학은 완전히 다르다. 카산드라는 관계형 데이터베이스가 아니다. 가장 큰 차이점은 다음과 같다.\n\n카산드라는 여러 테이블을 연결하는 JOIN 연산을 지원하지 않는다. 이는 분산 환경에서 JOIN이 유발하는 막대한 성능 저하를 원천적으로 차단하기 위함이다.\n외래 키(Foreign Key)와 같은 관계 무결성을 데이터베이스 차원에서 보장하지 않는다.\nRDBMS가 데이터의 관계를 정규화하여 모델링하는 반면, 카산드라는 애플리케이션이 사용할 쿼리(조회 방식)를 먼저 설계하고 그에 맞춰 테이블을 비정규화(denormalization)하여 구성한다.\n결론적으로, CQL은 SQL의 편리한 문법을 차용한, 분산 Key-Value 데이터 저장소에 최적화된 전혀 다른 언어이다.\n\n3. 개발자가 카산드라를 선택하는 이유\n개발자들은 RDBMS가 해결하기 어려운 특정 문제들을 풀기 위해 카산드라를 선택한다.\n\n가. 분산 아키텍처와 수평적 확장성 (Horizontal Scalability)\n이것이 카산드라를 사용하는 가장 큰 이유이다. 카산드라는 여러 서버(노드)를 묶어 하나의 거대한 데이터베이스처럼 사용하는 'Shared-Nothing' 분산 아키텍처를 기반으로 한다.\n\n수평적 확장: 데이터가 늘어나거나 트래픽이 증가할 때, 고가의 단일 서버 성능을 높이는 '수직적 확장'이 아니라, 저렴한 일반 서버를 클러스터에 계속 추가하는 '수평적 확장'이 가능하다. 이론적으로 서버를 추가하는 만큼 성능과 용량이 선형적으로 증가한다.\n대규모 데이터 처리: 수십억, 수백억 개의 행을 가진 페타바이트(PB)급 데이터를 처리하는 데 최적화되어 있다.\n\n나. 고가용성 및 장애 허용 (High Availability & Fault Tolerance)\n카산드라 클러스터에는 마스터(Master) 노드처럼 특별한 역할을 하는 노드가 없어 단일 장애점(SPOF, Single Point of Failure)이 존재하지 않는다.\n\n데이터 복제: 데이터는 클러스터 내 여러 노드에 자동으로 복제되어 저장된다.\n무중단 서비스: 특정 노드에 장애가 발생하더라도, 복제된 데이터를 가진 다른 노드가 즉시 요청을 처리하여 서비스 중단 없이 운영이 가능하다. 이는 24시간 365일 무중단이 필수적인 서비스에 결정적인 장점이다.\n다. 압도적인 쓰기 성능\n카산드라는 LSM-Tree (Log-Structured Merge-Tree) 라는 자료 구조를 사용하여 데이터를 저장한다. 이는 디스크에 데이터를 순차적으로 추가(Append-Only)하는 방식으로, 기존 RDBMS의 B-Tree 방식보다 쓰기 작업에 훨씬 유리하다.\n\n활용 사례: 사물 인터넷(IoT) 센서 데이터, 서비스 로그, 메시징 데이터처럼 끊임없이 대량으로 쏟아지는 데이터를 지연 없이 저장해야 하는 시스템에 최적이다.\n\n4. 실제 구현 사례 - 온톨로지 모델의 객체 저장소\n앞서 구현한 온톨로지 모델은 카산드라의 장점을 활용한 전형적인 데이터 아키텍처로 적용 가능하다.\n\n가. 아키텍처 장점\n이 시스템은 두 가지 데이터베이스를 조합하여 각자의 장점을 극대화한다.\n\n객체 저장소 (카산드라): 모든 객체의 원본 데이터를 저장하는 'Source of Truth' 역할을 한다.\n검색 인덱스 (엘라스틱서치): 카산드라에 저장된 데이터를 복사하여, 복잡한 검색 및 집계 기능을 제공한다.\n나. 카산드라의 역할\n온톨로지 모델의 객체 저장소로 카산드라를 선택할 때 좋은 이유는 다음과 같다.\n\nKey-Value 최적화: 온톨로지 객체는 고유 ID를 Key로, 속성 데이터를 Value로 갖는다. 이는 object_id를 파티션 키로 사용하는 카산드라의 데이터 모델과 완벽하게 부합하며, ID 기반 조회 시 최고의 성능을 보장한다.\n확장성: 수억, 수십억 개의 온톨로지 객체가 생성되더라도, 단순히 카산드라 클러스터에 노드를 추가하는 것만으로 시스템을 수평적으로 확장할 수 있다.\n가용성: 온톨로지 데이터는 기업의 핵심 자산이다. 카산드라의 무중단 특성은 일부 노드에 장애가 발생해도 객체 데이터의 유실 없이 안정적으로 서비스를 유지할 수 있도록 보장한다.\n다. 구현 코드\n다음은 카산드라와 엘라스틱서치를 사용하여 온톨로지 모델을 구현한 파이썬 코드이다. 이 코드는 위에서 설명한 아키텍처 원리를 추측해 구현해 본 것이다.\n\n\nimport uuid\nimport json\nimport time\nfrom cassandra.cluster import Cluster\nfrom cassandra.query import SimpleStatement\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch\n\n# 1. 데이터베이스 연결 설정\ndef setup_cassandra(contact_points=['127.0.0.1'], port=9042):\n    cluster = Cluster(contact_points, port=port)\n    session = cluster.connect()\n    \n    # 키스페이스 생성\n    session.execute(\"\"\"\n    CREATE KEYSPACE IF NOT EXISTS ontology\n    WITH replication = { 'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': '1' }\n    \"\"\")\n    session.set_keyspace('ontology')\n\n    # 객체 저장을 위한 테이블 생성 (JSON 문자열로 속성 저장)\n    session.execute(\"\"\"\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS objects (\n        object_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,\n        properties TEXT\n    )\n    \"\"\")\n    print(\"카산드라 설정 완료: 'ontology' 키스페이스 및 'objects' 테이블 준비됨.\")\n    return cluster, session\n\ndef setup_elasticsearch(hosts=[{'host': 'localhost', 'port': 9200, 'scheme': 'http'}]):\n    es_client = Elasticsearch(hosts=hosts)\n    if not es_client.ping():\n        raise ValueError(\"엘라스틱서치 연결에 실패.\")\n    print(\"엘라스틱서치 연결 성공.\")\n    return es_client\n\n# 2. 온톨로지 클래스 구현 \nclass Ontology:\n    def __init__(self, cassandra_session, es_client, es_index_name='ontology_index'):\n        self.session = cassandra_session\n        self.es = es_client\n        self.es_index = es_index_name\n        \n        if not self.es.indices.exists(index=self.es_index):\n            self.es.indices.create(index=self.es_index)\n            print(f\"엘라스틱서치 인덱스 '{self.es_index}' 생성됨.\")\n\n    def add_object(self, object_type, properties):\n        object_id = f\"{object_type}-{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}\"\n        full_properties = {\"object_type\": object_type, properties}\n        \n        query = SimpleStatement(\"INSERT INTO objects (object_id, properties) VALUES (%s, %s)\")\n        self.session.execute(query, (object_id, json.dumps(full_properties)))\n        \n        self.es.index(index=self.es_index, id=object_id, document=full_properties)\n        \n        print(f\"객체 추가됨: {object_id} (카산드라 저장, ES 인덱싱 완료)\")\n        return object_id\n\n    def get_object(self, object_id):\n        query = \"SELECT properties FROM objects WHERE object_id = %s\"\n        row = self.session.execute(query, (object_id,)).one()\n        if row:\n            return json.loads(row.properties)\n        return None\n\n    def search(self, property_key, property_value):\n        query = { \"match\": { f\"{property_key}.keyword\" if isinstance(property_value, str) else property_key: property_value } }\n        response = self.es.search(index=self.es_index, query=query)\n        hits = response['hits']['hits']\n        print(f\"\\nES 검색 실행 ('{property_key}:{property_value}')... {len(hits)}개 결과 찾음.\")\n        return [hit['_source'] for hit in hits]\n\n    def add_link(self, source_object_id, link_type, target_object_id):\n        source_object = self.get_object(source_object_id)\n        if not source_object: return\n\n        if \"_links\" not in source_object: source_object[\"_links\"] = {}\n        if link_type not in source_object[\"_links\"]: source_object[\"_links\"][link_type] = []\n        source_object[\"_links\"][link_type].append(target_object_id)\n        \n        query = SimpleStatement(\"INSERT INTO objects (object_id, properties) VALUES (%s, %s)\")\n        self.session.execute(query, (source_object_id, json.dumps(source_object)))\n        self.es.index(index=self.es_index, id=source_object_id, document=source_object)\n\n        print(f\"링크 추가 및 업데이트됨: {source_object_id} --({link_type})--> {target_object_id}\")\n\n5. 결론\n카산드라는 SQL과 유사한 CQL을 제공하여 개발자 친화적이지만, 그 본질은 대규모 분산 환경을 위해 태어난 NoSQL 데이터베이스이다. JOIN이나 참조 무결성을 포기하는 대신 수평적 확장성, 고가용성, 뛰어난 쓰기 성능이라는 명확한 장점을 얻었다.\n\n참고로, 오픈소스인 칸산드라 개발자는 아비나쉬 라크쉬만 (Avinash Lakshman), 프라샨트 말릭 (Prashant Malik)이다. 페이스북의 '받은 편지함 검색(Inbox Search)' 기능의 대규모 데이터 처리 요구사항을 충족시키기 위해 내부적으로 개발되었다. 아마존(Amazon)의 DynamoDB와 구글(Google)의 Bigtable 아키텍처에서 영감을 받아 설계되었다. 2008년 오픈소스로 공개된 후, 아파치 재단(ASF)의 최상위 프로젝트로 승격되어 전 세계적으로 널리 사용되는 분산 NoSQL 데이터베이스로 성장했다.\n\n\n팔란티어는 단일 개발자가 아닌, 각기 다른 전문성을 가진 공동 창업자들의 협업을 통해 탄생했다.\n피터 틸 (Peter Thiel)은 페이팔(PayPal)의 사기 방지 시스템 경험을 바탕으로 초기 비전을 제시한 핵심 창업자이다. 스티븐 코언 (Stephen Cohen)은 팔란티어 플랫폼의 초기 프로토타입을 직접 코딩한 핵심 엔지니어이다. 스탠퍼드 대학교 컴퓨터 과학 석사 출신으로, 그의 객체지향 프로그래밍(OOP) 배경이 온톨로지(Ontology) 아키텍처의 근간이 되었다. 네이선 게팅스 (Nathan Gettings)는 초기 엔지니어링 및 알고리즘 개발에 기여한 컴퓨터 과학자이다. \n\n\n플랫폼의 핵심인 온톨로지 개념은 창업자 그룹, 특히 스티븐 코언의 깊은 객체지향 프로그래밍(OOP) 이해도에서 비롯되었다. 이는 클래스(Class), 객체(Object), 관계(Link)로 현실을 모델링하는 OOP의 핵심 사상과 정확히 일치한다.\n\n온톨로지 구현 사례에서 보았듯이, 카산드라는 대규모 객체의 원본 데이터를 안정적으로 저장하고, 엘라스틱서치와 같은 검색 엔진과 결합하여 복잡한 조회 요구사항을 충족시키는 'Polyglot Persistence' 아키텍처의 핵심 구성 요소로 사용될 수 있다.",

Graph CNN 기반 모델들은 여러 사용자가 포크하고 개선해 온 포팅 버전, 튜토리얼 자료, 데이터 전처리/후처리 코드 등이 풍부하다. 이로 인해 새 사용자가 접근하기 쉬운 생태계가 형성되어 있다. 반면 최신 모델은 발표 직후 공개가 되더라도 문서화 수준이나 예제 범위가 제한적일 수 있다.<br /><br />실제 응용 환경에서는 리소스 제약 (GPU 메모리, 실시간 처리 요구 등)이 강하게 작용한다. Graph CNN 기반 경량 모델들은 이러한 제약 환경에서도 동작 가능성이 높다. 반면 최신 모델이 이론적으로 유리하더라도 제약이 많은 환경에서는 적용이 어렵다. 이미 많이 사용되고 비교 논문들이 많은 모델은 기준 모델로 자리잡기 쉽다. 새로운 모델은 처음 채택될 때 추가 검증 비용, 코드 디버깅 비용 등이 필요하므로 사용자가 쉽게 옮기기 어렵다. 따라서 관성 효과가 생긴다.<br /><br />기존의 경량 또는 비전통(point convolution, 샘플링 기반 등) 모델들이 여전히 많이 쓰이고 인기 있는 이유 중 하나는, 최신 Transformer 기반 모델이 성능 면에서는 일부 우위가 있을지라도, 추가 비용 대비 얻는 이득이 크지 않은 경우가 많기 때문이다. 즉, 가성비 관점에서 Transformer 모델이 불리한 상황이 존재할 가능성이 높다.<br /><br />최근 리뷰 논문 “Evaluating Deep Learning Advances for Point Cloud”에서는 PTv3 등 최신 point 기반 Transformer 모델이 여러 도심 장면(urban-scene) 벤치마크에서 정확도 측면에서는 우위를 보인다고 평가하지만, 논문에서는 “높은 계산 비용Limitation”이 실제 응용에서 병목 요소로 작용할 수 있다고 지적한다.

(<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2312.10035v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">arxiv.org</a>) 또한, DeepLA-Net이라는 최근 모델은 S3DIS 등 실내 점군 세그먼테이션 문제에서 더 적은 파라미터로도 PTv3를 능가한 성능을 달성했다고 보고하며, 단순 구조가 더 효율적일 수 있음을 시사한다. (<a href=\"https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Zeng_DeepLA-Net_Very_Deep_Local_Aggregation_Networks_for_Point_Cloud_Analysis_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">openaccess.thecvf.com</a>)<br /><br />또 다른 사례로, Superpoint Transformer는 적은 파라미터 수(약 212k)로도 여러 벤치마크에서 준수한 성능을 달성했으며, 코드 실행 시간이나 GPU 시간 측면에서도 효율적인 면을 강조한다. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08045?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">arxiv.org</a>) 또한 비교 논문 중 하나에서는, 새로운 모델이 RandLA-Net 대비 OA나 mIoU 면에서 약 3.0 % 또는 1.7 % 개선을 보였다는 보고가 있는데, 이 개선폭이 매우 크지 않음을 암시한다. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843224002164?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">ScienceDirect</a>)<br /><br />이들 사실을 바탕으로, 가성비 관점에서는 Transformer 계열이 비용 부담이 더 크고, 그 부담을 감수할 만큼의 성능 향상이 반드시 크지는 않다는 해석이 가능하다.<br /><br />아래는 가성비(trade-off) 관점에서 기존 모델이 유리한 경우와 Transformer 모델이 불리할 가능성이 높은 조건을 짚어보는 논리 흐름이다.</span></div><ul style=\"text-align: left;\"><li>기본 연산 비용 vs 성능 향상 폭: Transformer 구조에서 attention 모듈, positional encoding, neighbor 관계 계산 등은 비용이 크다. 따라서 이런 비용을 도입했을 때 얻는 성능 이득이 충분히 높지 않으면, 그 추가 비용 대비 실익이 작다. 예컨대 PTv3는 복잡한 neighbor search와 positional encoding을 일부 간소화하였고, 이를 통해 속도 및 메모리 절감을 달성했다고 하지만, 이러한 절감이 없었다면 전체 구조가 매우 무거웠을 것이다. (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2312.10035v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">arxiv.org</a>)</li><li>리소스 제약 환경에서의 제약: 실제 응용 환경에서는 GPU 메모리 한계, 배치 크기 제한, 실시간 처리 요구 등이 존재한다. Transformer 모델이 메모리 병목을 유발하면 배치 크기를 줄이거나 간소화된 구조를 써야 하고, 이 경우 성능이 위축될 가능성이 있다. 반면 경량 모델(예: RandLA-Net)은 처음부터 자원 부담을 작게 설계했기 때문에 제약 환경에서도 안정 동작 가능성이 높다.</li><li>구현 복잡성 및 안정성 비용: Transformer 계열은 복잡한 설계 요소 (attention, 샘플링 전략, hierarchical 구조, 메모리 최적화 등)를 많이 포함할 수 있다. 이러한 복잡성은 코드 버그, 디버깅 비용, 유지보수 비용을 증가시킬 수 있다. 경량 모델은 구조가 단순하므로 이러한 위험이 낮다.</li><li>성능 누적 격차의 한계: 최신 모델이 기존 모델보다 우수한 성능을 보인다고 해도, 그 격차가 크지 않은 경우가 많다. 예컨대 어떤 논문에서는 RandLA-Net 대비 약 3.0 % 정도 향상했다고 보고한 바 있다. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569843224002164?utm_source=chatgpt.com\">ScienceDirect</a>) 따라서 그 작은 격차를 얻기 위해 매우 큰 비용을 감수하는 것은 현실적으로 비효율적일 가능성이 높다.</li><li>효율 최적화가 가능한 경량 모델의 확장 가능성: 일부 경량 모델은 이미 여러 최적화 기법, 하드웨어 친화적 연산, 포팅, 병렬화 등이 누적되어 왔다. 따라서 동일한 하드웨어에서 더 안정적으로 동작한다.</li><li> 반면 Transformer 기반 모델은 최적화가 미흡한 구현일 가능성이 높고, 하드웨어 제약에 덜 친화적일 수 있다.</li></ul><div>기존 경량 기반 모델들과 Transformer 계열 모델 간 성능을 살펴보면, 실제로 큰 격차가 없는 경우가 상당히 많다. 최신 Transformer 모델은 일부 벤치마크에서 우위를 보이기도 하지만, 그 성능 향상 폭이 매우 크지는 않다. 반면 Transformer 구조가 도입하는 비용 (메모리, 연산, 구현 복잡성 등) 은 상당하다. 이런 맥락에서, 가성비 측면에서는 오히려 Transformer 계열이 불리한 경우가 많다고 볼 수 있다. 즉, 동일한 자원 또는 제한된 환경 하에서는 경량 또는 구조가 단순한 모델이 더 실용적 선택이 될 가능성이 높다.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>부록: 24GB VRAM 내 가성비 있는 점군 학습 모델</b></div><div><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-202fb978-7fff-ce4a-27bf-8b38d57e00f2\">GPU VRAM 24 GB 환경에서 실용성과 가성비를 고려했을 때 “가장 사용하기 좋다”고 판단할 수 있는 모델은 전통적인 경량 또는 절충형 구조 모델 중 하나가 될 가능성이 높다. 다만 “가장 좋다”는 조건은 사용자의 입력 규모, 배치 크기, 속도 요구, 세그먼테이션 난이도 등에 따라 달라지므로 아래는 여러 후보와 고려 요소를 같이 제시한다.<br />고려 기준 정리<br /><br />먼저 24 GB VRAM 환경에서 모델 선택 시 고려해야 할 주요 요소들을 정리하면 다음과 같다.<div align=\"left\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"margin-left: 0pt;\"><table style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

PyTorch 포팅 중 하나는 399 스타를 보유하고 있다. (GitHub) Open3D 문서에서는 RandLA-Net을 “efficient and lightweight” 구조라고 명시하고 있어, 낮은 메모리 및 계산 요구를 강조하고 있다. (open3d.org) 반면 Point Transformer V3는 공식 저장소가 존재하고 활발히 관리되고 있으나 일부 사용자는 Scannet 데이터셋 검증 시 성능 이슈를 제기하기도 한다. (GitHub) PTv3 논문에서는 neighbor mapping 직렬화, 메모리 절감 설계 등을 통해 performance/efficiency trade-off를 극복하려는 노력을 보였다. (openaccess.thecvf.com)\n구조적 비교 관점에서, Graph CNN 기반 모델들은 복잡한 attention이나 토큰 샘플링 모듈이 적거나 전혀 없어서 구현 난이도가 낮고 디버깅 및 커스터마이즈가 수월하다. 반면 Transformer 기반 모델은 attention 모듈, neighbor 관계 처리, 메모리 관리, 병렬화 등 복합 요소가 포함되므로 구현 복잡도가 증가한다. 리소스 부담 측면에서도 Transformer 계열은 메모리 및 연산량이 클 가능성이 높다. 일부 모델은 최적화 설계를 포함하여 메모리 절감을 시도하지만, 여전히 대규모 점군 처리 시 병목 가능성이 크다. 사용성 및 커뮤니티 지원 측면에서는 Graph CNN 기반 모델들이 다양한 포팅 버전, 튜토리얼, 예제 코드, 버그 수정 커뮤니티 등이 누적되어 있어 연구자나 개발자가 처음 적용하기에 유리하다.\n아래 표는 대표 모델들에 대해 (가능한 범위 내에서) GitHub 지표, 구현 복잡도, 리소스 부담, 사용성 측면 요소들을 정리한 것이다.\n\n\n\n\n모델명\n\nGitHub 인기 / 지표 (스타, 포크 등)\n\n구현 복잡도 / 구조 특성\n\n리소스 부담 (메모리, 연산)\n\n사용성 / 문서화 / 커뮤니티 지원\n\n강점 / 한계 요인\n\n\nRandLA-Net (QingyongHu 공식)\n\n공식 저장소 스타 수 다소 높음 (공식 구현) (GitHub) 비공식 PyTorch 포팅 구현 중 하나는 399 스타 (GitHub)\n\n비교적 단순한 구조. 랜덤 샘플링 + 지역 특성 집계 방식 사용\n\n경량 설계.

Graph CNN 기반 모델들은 여러 사용자가 포크하고 개선해 온 포팅 버전, 튜토리얼 자료, 데이터 전처리/후처리 코드 등이 풍부하다. 이로 인해 새 사용자가 접근하기 쉬운 생태계가 형성되어 있다. 반면 최신 모델은 발표 직후 공개가 되더라도 문서화 수준이나 예제 범위가 제한적일 수 있다.\n실제 응용 환경에서는 리소스 제약 (GPU 메모리, 실시간 처리 요구 등)이 강하게 작용한다. Graph CNN 기반 경량 모델들은 이러한 제약 환경에서도 동작 가능성이 높다. 반면 최신 모델이 이론적으로 유리하더라도 제약이 많은 환경에서는 적용이 어렵다. 이미 많이 사용되고 비교 논문들이 많은 모델은 기준 모델로 자리잡기 쉽다. 새로운 모델은 처음 채택될 때 추가 검증 비용, 코드 디버깅 비용 등이 필요하므로 사용자가 쉽게 옮기기 어렵다. 따라서 관성 효과가 생긴다.\n기존의 경량 또는 비전통(point convolution, 샘플링 기반 등) 모델들이 여전히 많이 쓰이고 인기 있는 이유 중 하나는, 최신 Transformer 기반 모델이 성능 면에서는 일부 우위가 있을지라도, 추가 비용 대비 얻는 이득이 크지 않은 경우가 많기 때문이다. 즉, 가성비 관점에서 Transformer 모델이 불리한 상황이 존재할 가능성이 높다.\n최근 리뷰 논문 “Evaluating Deep Learning Advances for Point Cloud”에서는 PTv3 등 최신 point 기반 Transformer 모델이 여러 도심 장면(urban-scene) 벤치마크에서 정확도 측면에서는 우위를 보인다고 평가하지만, 논문에서는 “높은 계산 비용Limitation”이 실제 응용에서 병목 요소로 작용할 수 있다고 지적한다. (d-nb.info)\n한편, PTv3 논문 자체에서도, 기존의 복잡한 neighbor search + positional encoding 방식을 단순화하고 직렬화된 neighbor mapping 등을 도입하여, 처리 속도 3배 향상과 메모리 사용량 10배 절감 효과를 주장한 것은, 기본 Transformer 구조가 비용 측면에서 부담이 크다는 인식을 전제로 한 설계 전략이다. (arxiv.org) 또한, DeepLA-Net이라는 최근 모델은 S3DIS 등 실내 점군 세그먼테이션 문제에서 더 적은 파라미터로도 PTv3를 능가한 성능을 달성했다고 보고하며, 단순 구조가 더 효율적일 수 있음을 시사한다. (openaccess.thecvf.com)\n또 다른 사례로, Superpoint Transformer는 적은 파라미터 수(약 212k)로도 여러 벤치마크에서 준수한 성능을 달성했으며, 코드 실행 시간이나 GPU 시간 측면에서도 효율적인 면을 강조한다. (arxiv.org) 또한 비교 논문 중 하나에서는, 새로운 모델이 RandLA-Net 대비 OA나 mIoU 면에서 약 3.0 % 또는 1.7 % 개선을 보였다는 보고가 있는데, 이 개선폭이 매우 크지 않음을 암시한다. (ScienceDirect)\n이들 사실을 바탕으로, 가성비 관점에서는 Transformer 계열이 비용 부담이 더 크고, 그 부담을 감수할 만큼의 성능 향상이 반드시 크지는 않다는 해석이 가능하다.\n아래는 가성비(trade-off) 관점에서 기존 모델이 유리한 경우와 Transformer 모델이 불리할 가능성이 높은 조건을 짚어보는 논리 흐름이다.\n\n기본 연산 비용 vs 성능 향상 폭: Transformer 구조에서 attention 모듈, positional encoding, neighbor 관계 계산 등은 비용이 크다. 따라서 이런 비용을 도입했을 때 얻는 성능 이득이 충분히 높지 않으면, 그 추가 비용 대비 실익이 작다. 예컨대 PTv3는 복잡한 neighbor search와 positional encoding을 일부 간소화하였고, 이를 통해 속도 및 메모리 절감을 달성했다고 하지만, 이러한 절감이 없었다면 전체 구조가 매우 무거웠을 것이다. (arxiv.org)\n리소스 제약 환경에서의 제약: 실제 응용 환경에서는 GPU 메모리 한계, 배치 크기 제한, 실시간 처리 요구 등이 존재한다. Transformer 모델이 메모리 병목을 유발하면 배치 크기를 줄이거나 간소화된 구조를 써야 하고, 이 경우 성능이 위축될 가능성이 있다. 반면 경량 모델(예: RandLA-Net)은 처음부터 자원 부담을 작게 설계했기 때문에 제약 환경에서도 안정 동작 가능성이 높다.\n구현 복잡성 및 안정성 비용: Transformer 계열은 복잡한 설계 요소 (attention, 샘플링 전략, hierarchical 구조, 메모리 최적화 등)를 많이 포함할 수 있다. 이러한 복잡성은 코드 버그, 디버깅 비용, 유지보수 비용을 증가시킬 수 있다. 경량 모델은 구조가 단순하므로 이러한 위험이 낮다.\n성능 누적 격차의 한계: 최신 모델이 기존 모델보다 우수한 성능을 보인다고 해도, 그 격차가 크지 않은 경우가 많다. 예컨대 어떤 논문에서는 RandLA-Net 대비 약 3.0 % 정도 향상했다고 보고한 바 있다. (ScienceDirect) 따라서 그 작은 격차를 얻기 위해 매우 큰 비용을 감수하는 것은 현실적으로 비효율적일 가능성이 높다.\n효율 최적화가 가능한 경량 모델의 확장 가능성: 일부 경량 모델은 이미 여러 최적화 기법, 하드웨어 친화적 연산, 포팅, 병렬화 등이 누적되어 왔다. 따라서 동일한 하드웨어에서 더 안정적으로 동작한다.\n 반면 Transformer 기반 모델은 최적화가 미흡한 구현일 가능성이 높고, 하드웨어 제약에 덜 친화적일 수 있다.\n\n기존 경량 기반 모델들과 Transformer 계열 모델 간 성능을 살펴보면, 실제로 큰 격차가 없는 경우가 상당히 많다. 최신 Transformer 모델은 일부 벤치마크에서 우위를 보이기도 하지만, 그 성능 향상 폭이 매우 크지는 않다. 반면 Transformer 구조가 도입하는 비용 (메모리, 연산, 구현 복잡성 등) 은 상당하다. 이런 맥락에서, 가성비 측면에서는 오히려 Transformer 계열이 불리한 경우가 많다고 볼 수 있다. 즉, 동일한 자원 또는 제한된 환경 하에서는 경량 또는 구조가 단순한 모델이 더 실용적 선택이 될 가능성이 높다.\n\n\n부록: 24GB VRAM 내 가성비 있는 점군 학습 모델\nGPU VRAM 24 GB 환경에서 실용성과 가성비를 고려했을 때 “가장 사용하기 좋다”고 판단할 수 있는 모델은 전통적인 경량 또는 절충형 구조 모델 중 하나가 될 가능성이 높다. 다만 “가장 좋다”는 조건은 사용자의 입력 규모, 배치 크기, 속도 요구, 세그먼테이션 난이도 등에 따라 달라지므로 아래는 여러 후보와 고려 요소를 같이 제시한다.\n고려 기준 정리\n먼저 24 GB VRAM 환경에서 모델 선택 시 고려해야 할 주요 요소들을 정리하면 다음과 같다.\n\n\n요소\n\n중요 이유\n\n\n메모리 사용량 (activation, 중간 피처 등)\n\nVRAM 한계 내에서 모델을 돌려야 하며, 배치 크기를 확보해야 함\n\n\n연산 효율 / 플롭스 비용\n\n연산량이 너무 많으면 속도 저하 / 병목 발생 가능\n\n\n구현 안정성 및 최적화 지원\n\n잘 최적화된 오픈소스가 있어야 버그 없이 돌릴 수 있음\n\n\n성능 대비 비용 (가성비)\n\n작은 리소스 증가로 얻는 성능 이득이 충분해야 함\n\n\n응용 환경 적합성\n\n대규모 점군 처리, 실시간 처리, 복잡 장면 등 조건 고려\n\n\n\n\n\n아래는 24 GB VRAM 환경에서 실용적 후보가 될 만한 모델들과 그 장단점을 정리한 것이다.\n\n\n\n모델\n\n장점 / 적합성\n\n단점 / 리스크\n\n\nRandLA-Net\n\n매우 경량 설계 + random sampling 기반 처리로 메모리 부담이 낮다. 논문에서는 1백만 점 처리 가능하다고 주장하며 효율성을 강조했다. (arxiv.org) 여러 실험에서 안정적 성능을 보이며 벤치마크에서 교차 검증된 모델임 (d-nb.info)\n\n세밀한 복잡 장면이나 더 복잡한 구조 관계 모델링에서는 한계가 있을 수 있음\n\n\nOctFormer\n\nTransformer 계열이지만 octree 기반 attention을 사용하여 계산 복잡도를 줄인 구조이다. 그 결과 대규모 점군 처리 시 연산 및 메모리 효율이 상대적으로 우수하다고 보고됨. (arxiv.org) 논문에서는 “17배 빠르다”는 주장을 포함함. (arxiv.org)\n\nTransformer 계열 특성상 일부 overhead가 남아 있으며, 실제 구현 최적화 여부가 중요하다\n\n\n경량 + Sparse + Attention 혼합 구조 모델\n\n예: “Real-Time Semantic Segmentation of Point Clouds Based on an Attention Mechanism and a Sparse Tensor” 논문처럼 sparse tensor + 경량 attention 구조를 쓴 모델이 있다. 이 경우 메모리 및 연산 절감 측면에서 유리하다. (mdpi.com)\n\n성능이 매우 복잡한 장면에서는 한계 있을 수 있으며, 구현 및 튜닝이 중요하다\n\n\n하이브리드 절충형 구조 (Convolution + Transformer 병합)\n\n적절히 설계된 하이브리드 모델은 Transformer의 글로벌 컨텍스트 장점과 convolution 계열의 효율성을 절충할 수 있다\n\n병합 방식 설계 복잡성, 메모리 overhead가 추가될 가능성 있음\n\n\n\n이 모든 것을 고려하면, RandLA-Net 계열 구조 또는 OctFormer 쪽이 24 GB VRAM 환경에서 가장 균형 잡힌 선택이 될 가능성이 크다.\n\nRandLA-Net은 이미 경량성과 안정성을 증명한 모델이다.\nOctFormer은 Transformer 계열이지만 octree attention을 통한 효율화가 설계되어 있어, 비교적 부담이 덜한 Transformer 방향 대안이 될 수 있다.\n만약 응용이 복잡 장면이나 많은 점군을 다룬다면, OctFormer 같은 구조 쪽이 더 유연성을 줄 가능성이 있다.\n따라서, 24 GB VRAM 기준으로 “가장 사용하기 좋다”는 점을 감안하면 RandLA-Net이 가장 무난한 선택이며, Transformer 계열 모델을 쓰고 싶다면 OctFormer이 현실적 대안이 될 것이다.",

RandLA-Net은 가장 적은 VRAM과 가장 빠른 추론 속도를 보여준다. Stratified Transformer는 빠른 추론 속도를 유지하면서 중간 수준의 VRAM을 요구하여 효율성과 성능의 균형을 맞추었다. 다른 모델들은 상대적으로 많은 리소스를 필요로 하거나 느린 추론 속도를 보인다.</div><br /><b>결론</b><br />점군 세분화 기술은 PointNet++의 계층적 구조에서 시작하여, KPConv와 같은 CNN 유사 접근법과 PointEdgeSegNet과 같은 GNN 접근법으로 발전해왔다.

SA 모듈은 샘플링, 그룹핑, 그리고 특징 추출의 세 단계로 구성된다.\n샘플링(Sampling): Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) 방식을 사용하여 전체 점군으로부터 기하학적으로 가장 멀리 떨어진 점들을 순차적으로 선택한다. 이를 통해 더 넓은 영역을 대표하는 중심점(centroid)들을 효율적으로 정의할 수 있다.\n그룹핑(Grouping): 샘플링된 각 중심점을 기준으로 일정 반경 내의 모든 점 또는 K개의 가장 가까운 이웃 점들을 하나의 지역 집합으로 묶는다. 이 과정을 통해 전체 점군을 여러 개의 국소 영역으로 분할한다.\n특징 추출(Feature Extraction): 그룹핑된 각 지역 집합에 대해 PointNet(이를 '미니 PointNet'이라 칭함)을 적용한다. 미니 PointNet은 지역 집합 내의 점들의 좌표를 정규화하고, 다층 퍼셉트론(MLP)을 통해 각 점의 특징을 추출한 후, Max-Pooling 연산을 통해 지역 전체를 대표하는 하나의 특징 벡터를 생성한다.\n특징 전파(Feature Propagation): 세분화 작업을 위해 인코더에서 다운샘플링된 특징을 다시 원래 해상도의 모든 점으로 복원하는 과정이다. 업샘플링된 점의 특징은 저해상도 점들의 특징을 역거리가중(Inverse Distance Weighted) 보간법을 사용하여 계산하며, 인코더 단계의 Skip Connection을 통해 전달된 특징과 결합하여 세부 정보를 보존한다.\n\n장점은 계층적 구조를 통해 다양한 스케일의 기하학적 특징을 학습할 수 있다는 점이며, 이는 이후 대부분의 점군 처리 모델이 채택하는 표준적인 패러다임이 되었다. 반면, 단점으로는 FPS의 계산 복잡도가 점군 크기(N)와 샘플링할 점의 수(M)에 비례()하여 증가하므로 대규모 점군에 직접 적용하기 어렵다는 점이 있다. 또한, 고정된 반경으로 그룹핑하는 방식은 점군 밀도가 불균일할 경우 성능 저하를 야기할 수 있다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): OA는 약 89.2%, mIoU는 약 65.4% 수준이다.\n대용량 처리: 부적합하다. 수만 개 이상의 점군에서는 FPS 연산이 심각한 병목 현상을 일으킨다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 8에서 12GB가 필요하며, 학습 시간은 중간 정도 소요된다. 추론 시간은 FPS 때문에 실시간 처리가 어려워 느린 편이다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet2\n\nPointEdgeSegNet\n이 모델은 점군을 하나의 그래프로 간주하는 그래프 신경망(GNN) 접근법을 채택했다. 특히 DGCNN에서 제안된 EdgeConv 연산을 U-Net 아키텍처에 통합하여, 점과 그 이웃 점들 간의 관계를 '엣지 특징'으로 명시적으로 모델링한다. 이를 통해 정확도와 효율성의 균형을 목표로 한다.\n\n구조적 특징: 구조의 핵심 연산은 EdgeConv이다. 이는 K-NN(K-Nearest Neighbors) 알고리즘으로 각 점의 이웃을 찾아 동적으로 그래프를 구성하고, 중심점의 특징()과 이웃점과의 상대적 위치 벡터()를 결합한 엣지 특징 [xi, xj - xi]을 생성한다. 이 엣지 특징은 중심점 자체의 정보와 주변의 기하학적 정보를 동시에 담고 있으며, MLP를 통과한 후 대칭 함수인 Max-Pooling으로 집계되어 중심점의 새로운 특징으로 갱신된다. 전체 구조는 대칭적인 인코더-디코더 구조인 U-Net을 채택하여, 인코더에서는 EdgeConv와 FPS를 통해 특징을 추출 및 다운샘플링하고, 디코더에서는 k-NN 보간과 Skip Connection으로 특징을 업샘플링하여 세부 정보를 보존한다.\n\n장점은 엣지 특징을 통해 점들 간의 기하학적 관계를 명시적으로 학습하므로 지역적 패턴에 대한 표현력이 우수하며, U-Net 구조 덕분에 정보 손실이 적다는 것이다. 공간인덱싱을 통한 대용량 점군을 격자 블럭으로 처리한 후 학습 및 예측하므로 대용량 점군 처리가 가능하다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): 성능 추정치에 따르면, OA는 약 91.5%이다.\n대용량 처리: 제한적이다. FPS 대신 Grid Subsampling 등을 사용하면 일부 개선이 가능하다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 10에서 16GB가 필요하며, 학습 시간은 중간 정도 소요된다. 추론 시간은 느린 편에서 중간 수준에 해당한다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/mac999/point_edge_seg_net/tree/main\nKPConv\nKPConv는 이미지 CNN의 '컨볼루션 필터' 개념을 3D 공간으로 직접 일반화한 모델이다. 유클리드 공간에 미리 정의된 커널 포인트(Kernel Points)를 컨볼루션 필터의 핵으로 삼고, 이 커널 포인트들과 입력 점들 간의 거리에 따라 가중치를 적용하는 방식으로, 진정한 의미의 3D 공간 컨볼루션을 구현했다.\n\n구조적 특징: 핵심 연산인 KPConv는 구(sphere) 형태의 공간 안에 미리 정의된 커널 포인트들을 배치하는 방식으로 작동한다. 각 커널 포인트는 고유의 학습 가능한 가중치 행렬을 가지며, 입력 점과의 거리가 가까울수록 더 큰 영향력을 행사하도록 상관관계를 계산한다. 이 커널은 고정된 형태의 Rigid KPConv와, 지역 형상에 따라 커널 포인트의 위치가 동적으로 변형되는 Deformable KPConv로 나뉜다. 다운샘플링 방식으로는 FPS 대신 Grid Subsampling을 사용하여 점군을 복셀화하고 각 복셀의 중심점을 취하는 방식으로 대규모 데이터 처리 속도를 개선했다.\n장점은 유연하고 강력한 커널 덕분에 복잡한 기하학적 구조에 대한 표현력이 매우 뛰어나며, 높은 정확도를 달성한다는 것이다. 단점은 커널 기반 연산이 각 점과 모든 커널 포인트 간의 상호작용을 계산해야 하므로 계산 비용과 메모리 요구량이 매우 크다는 점이다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): OA는 약 92.9%, mIoU는 약 70.6%이다.\n대용량 처리: 가능하다. Grid Subsampling 덕분에 수백만 점군 처리가 가능하지만, 리소스 요구량이 높다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 16에서 24GB 이상으로 높은 편이며, 학습 시간도 길다. 추론 시간은 RandLA-Net 대비 수십 배 느려 느린 편에 속한다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv\n\nRandLA-Net\n이 모델은 대규모 점군을 실시간으로 처리하는 실용성에 초점을 맞춘 모델이다. '무작위 샘플링(Random Sampling)'을 통해 계산 복잡도를 획기적으로 낮추고, 이로 인해 발생할 수 있는 정보 손실은 강력한 '지역 특징 집계(Local Feature Aggregation, LFA)' 모듈로 보완하는 전략을 사용한다.\n\n구조적 특징: 샘플링 단계에서는 계산 비용이 전혀 없는 무작위 샘플링을 사용하여 인코더의 각 단계에서 점군을 대폭 줄인다. 핵심 블록인 LFA는 지역 공간 인코딩(LocSE), 어텐션 풀링(Attentive Pooling), 그리고 Dilated Residual Block으로 구성된다. LocSE는 이웃 점들의 상대적 위치 정보를 명시적으로 인코딩하고, 어텐션 풀링은 이웃들의 특징에 대해 학습 가능한 어텐션 가중치를 부여하여 중요한 특징을 선별적으로 집계한다. 이 어텐션 풀링이 무작위 샘플링의 단점을 보완하는 핵심 장치이다.\n장점은 압도적으로 빠른 처리 속도와 낮은 메모리 요구량을 가진다는 것이다. 수백만 개 이상의 점군을 단일 패스로 처리할 수 있다. 단점으로는 무작위 샘플링이 필연적으로 중요한 기하학적 특징을 가진 점을 누락시킬 수 있어, 작고 복잡한 객체에 대한 정밀도가 다른 정교한 모델들에 비해 다소 떨어진다는 점이 있다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): OA는 약 92.2%, mIoU는 약 70.0%이다.\n대용량 처리: 최적화되어 있으며, 이것이 이 모델의 핵심 설계 목표이다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 8에서 11GB로 낮은 편이다. 학습 시간은 짧고, 추론 시간은 매우 빨라 실시간 처리에 가장 근접한 모델로 평가된다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/QingyongHu/RandLA-Net\n\n\nPoint Transformer\nPoint Transformer는 자연어 처리 분야에서 성공을 거둔 트랜스포머 아키텍처를 점군에 적용한 모델이다. PointNet++의 계층적 구조를 기반으로, 지역 특징 추출 부분을 셀프-어텐션(Self-Attention) 메커니즘으로 대체하여 점들 간의 문맥적 관계를 더욱 정교하게 학습한다.\n\n구조의 핵심인 Point Transformer Block은 지역 그룹 내의 한 점(Query)이 다른 모든 점(Key)들과 얼마나 관련이 있는지 어텐션 스코어를 계산하고, 이 스코어를 가중치로 삼아 모든 점들의 특징(Value)을 가중합하여 새로운 특징을 생성한다. 특히 점들 간의 상대적 위치 정보를 어텐션 계산에 명시적으로 포함시켜 기하학적 문맥을 강화한다.\n\n장점은 셀프-어텐션을 통해 복잡한 지역 패턴과 객체 파트 간의 상호작용을 효과적으로 모델링하여 높은 성능을 보인다는 것이다. 단점은 어텐션 연산이 그룹 내 점의 수(N)에 대해 제곱()에 비례하는 계산 복잡도를 가져 매우 비효율적이라는 점이다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): OA는 약 93.0%, mIoU는 약 70.9%이다.\n대용량 처리: 부적합하다. 높은 계산 복잡도 때문에 대규모 점군에 적용할 수 없다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 24GB 이상으로 매우 높고, 학습 시간도 매우 길다. 추론 시간 역시 매우 느리다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/point-transformer\nStratified Transformer\n이 모델은 대규모 점군에 트랜스포머를 효율적으로 적용하기 위해 이미지 분야의 Swin Transformer 아이디어를 3D로 확장한 모델이다. 계층적 샘플링과 윈도우 기반 지역 어텐션이라는 두 가지 핵심 전략을 통해 트랜스포머의 계산량 문제를 해결했다.\n\n구조적 특징: 다운샘플링에는 FPS와 Random의 장점을 결합한 Stratified Sampling 방식을 사용하여 효율적이면서도 공간을 균일하게 커버한다. 핵심은 윈도우 어텐션으로, 전체 공간을 겹치지 않는 작은 3D 윈도우(복셀)로 분할하고, 각 윈도우 내부에서만 지역적으로 어텐션을 수행하여 계산 복잡도를 점의 수에 비례하도록 낮춘다. 또한 윈도우 이동(Shifted Window) 기법을 통해 다음 레이어에서는 윈도우 경계를 이동시켜 인접 윈도우 간의 정보 교환을 가능하게 한다. 이를 통해 지역 어텐션만으로도 전역적인 문맥을 효과적으로 학습할 수 있다.\n장점은 트랜스포머의 강력한 표현력과 대규모 처리 능력을 겸비하여, 효율성과 정확도 모두에서 최고 수준의 성능을 보인다는 것이다. 단점은 모델 구조가 상대적으로 복잡하고, 윈도우 크기 등 하이퍼파라미터 설정에 민감할 수 있다는 점이다.\n\n성능 (S3DIS Area 5): OA는 약 94.1%, mIoU는 약 74.5%로 매우 높다.\n대용량 처리: 최적화되어 있다.\n리소스 및 시간 요구사항: VRAM은 11에서 16GB로 중간에서 높은 수준이며 RandLA-Net보다 높지만 KPConv보다 효율적이다. 학습 시간은 중간에서 긴 편이며, 추론 시간은 빠르다.\nGitHub 주소: https://github.com/dvlab-research/Stratified-Transformer \n\n비교 분석\n\n\n\n구분\n\nPointNet++\n\nPointEdgeSegNet\n\nKPConv\n\nRandLA-Net\n\nPoint Transformer\n\nStratified Transformer\n\n\n핵심 접근법\n\n계층적 집합 추상화\n\n그래프 엣지 특징 (GNN)\n\n공간 커널 컨볼루션 (CNN-like)\n\n무작위 샘플링 + 어텐션 풀링\n\n지역 셀프-어텐션 (Transformer)\n\n윈도우 기반 셀프-어텐션\n\n\nmIoU (S3DIS)\n\n~65.4%\n\n~68.0%\n\n~70.6%\n\n~70.0%\n\n~70.9%\n\n~74.5%\n\n\n대용량 처리\n\nX (부적합)\n\n△ (제한적)\n\nO (가능)\n\n◎ (최적)\n\nX (부적합)\n\n◎ (최적)\n\n\n추론 속도\n\n느림\n\n중간-느림\n\n매우 느림\n\n매우 빠름\n\n매우 느림\n\n빠름\n\n\nVRAM 요구량\n\n중간\n\n중간\n\n높음\n\n낮음\n\n매우 높음\n\n중간-높음\n\n\n주요 장점\n\n개념적 토대 제공\n\n명시적 관계 모델링\n\n높은 정확도, 표현력\n\n최고의 속도와 효율성\n\n강력한 문맥 추론\n\n최고의 정확도와 확장성\n\n\n주요 단점\n\n비효율적 샘플링\n\n확장성 한계\n\n높은 계산 비용\n\n정밀도 저하 가능성\n\n높은 계산 복잡도\n\n구조의 복잡성\n\n\n\n각 모델의 핵심 접근법을 서술적으로 비교하면 다음과 같다. PointNet++는 계층적 집합 추상화를, PointEdgeSegNet은 그래프 엣지 특징을, KPConv는 공간 커널 컨볼루션을, RandLA-Net은 무작위 샘플링을, Point Transformer는 지역 셀프-어텐션을, 그리고 Stratified Transformer는 윈도우 어텐션을 사용한다.\nS3DIS 데이터셋에 대한 성능을 비교하면, OA와 mIoU 지표 모두에서 Stratified Transformer가 각각 약 94.1%, 약 74.5%로 가장 높은 성능을 보인다. 그 뒤를 이어 Point Transformer, KPConv, RandLA-Net이 유사한 성능 그룹을 형성하며, PointEdgeSegNet과 PointNet++가 그 뒤를 잇는다.\n대용량 처리 능력 측면에서는 RandLA-Net과 Stratified Transformer가 가장 최적화된 성능을 보인다. 반면 KPConv는 처리가 가능하지만 높은 리소스를 요구하며, PointNet++, PointEdgeSegNet, Point Transformer는 대용량 처리에 부적합하다.\nVRAM 요구량과 추론 속도는 효율성과 직결된다. RandLA-Net은 가장 적은 VRAM과 가장 빠른 추론 속도를 보여준다. Stratified Transformer는 빠른 추론 속도를 유지하면서 중간 수준의 VRAM을 요구하여 효율성과 성능의 균형을 맞추었다. 다른 모델들은 상대적으로 많은 리소스를 필요로 하거나 느린 추론 속도를 보인다.\n결론\n점군 세분화 기술은 PointNet++의 계층적 구조에서 시작하여, KPConv와 같은 CNN 유사 접근법과 PointEdgeSegNet과 같은 GNN 접근법으로 발전해왔다. RandLA-Net은 대규모 처리를 위해 효율성에 초점을 맞춘 중요한 이정표를 제시했다. 최근에는 Point Transformer가 어텐션의 강력한 표현력을 입증했지만 계산 복잡도의 한계가 명확했다.",

UI, 즉 사용자 인터페이스를 만드는 데 특화된 제가 직접 만든 전문적인 디자인 툴입니다. 마치 어릴 적 레고 블록을 조립하듯, 미리 만들어진 다양한 UI 컴포넌트들을 캔버스 위에 자유롭게 배치하면서 나만의 앱 화면을 <b>직관적으로 디자인</b>할 수 있어요. 버튼, 입력창, 이미지 박스는 물론이고, 조금 더 복잡한 차트까지 없는 게 없답니다. 그냥 마우스로 끌어다 놓기만 하면 끝이에요!</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">여기서 제가 정말 중요하다고 생각하는 점은, 이 툴이 단순히 '보이는 대로 그리는' 것에 그치지 않는다는 거예요. 각각의 컴포넌트에는 실제 앱처럼 동작할 수 있는 <b>고유한 속성과 데이터</b>가 담겨있습니다. 이것은 곧, 여러분이 만드는 디자인이 단순한 그림이 아니라, 실제 개발로 바로 이어질 수 있는 <b>'살아있는 설계도'</b>가 된다는 의미예요. 기획자와 디자이너, 개발자 사이에 늘 존재했던 그 복잡한 소통 과정을 획기적으로 줄여주는, 그야말로 <b>강력한 다리 역할</b>을 해주는 거죠. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 이런 부분에서 오는 효율성이 정말 어마어마합니다.</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #0f4c81, #002f6c); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>✨ UI 캔버스의 핵심 기능: 두 가지 마법</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">UI 캔버스에는 여러분의 앱 개발 경험을 완전히 바꿔놓을 두 가지 핵심 마법 같은 기능이 숨어있어요. 이 기능들 덕분에 '5분 만에 앱 뚝딱'이라는 말이 절대 과장이 아니게 됩니다.</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>1. AI 이미지 분석: 캡처 이미지를 살아있는 앱으로</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">길을 걷다 발견한 멋진 앱 디자인, 혹은 웹사이트에서 본 인상 깊은 UI. 그저 한 장의 스크린샷이나 이미지가 순식간에 <b>실제 작동하는 UI 컴포넌트</b>로 변신하는 현실을 상상해 보셨나요? UI 캔버스의 첫 번째 마법이 바로 이겁니다. 캡처 이미지를 업로드하기만 하면, 제가 제미나이 AI와 협력하여 헤더, 버튼, 입력창 등 각 요소의 기능과 관계를 <b>정밀하게 분석</b>해요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그리고 몇 초 만에! 믿기 어렵겠지만, 몇 초 만에 작동하는 UI 컴포넌트로 화면을 완벽하게 재구성해 줍니다. 이건 단순히 이미지를 베끼는 것을 넘어섭니다. AI가 디자인의 의도와 구조를 파악해서 마치 <b>리버스 엔지니어링</b>을 하는 것처럼, 새로운 창조의 과정을 만들어낸다고 보시면 돼요. 솔직히 저도 처음 이 기능을 구현했을 때 정말 놀랐답니다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ba85zj/btsQ7bh36mt/s8gobJvETklgtoBu1pv2Hk/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ba85zj/btsQ7bh36mt/s8gobJvETklgtoBu1pv2Hk/img.jpg\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/ba85zj/btsQ7bh36mt/s8gobJvETklgtoBu1pv2Hk/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fba85zj%2FbtsQ7bh36mt%2Fs8gobJvETklgtoBu1pv2Hk%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"AI가 앱 스크린샷을 분석하여 기능적인 UI 컴포넌트로 재구성하는 과정을 보여주는 UI 캔버스 화면\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1408\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.jpg\" data-origin-width=\"1408\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<div style=\"background-color: #e3f2fd; border-left: 4px solid #0f4c81; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>팁:</b> 영감을 얻은 이미지가 있다면 주저 말고 업로드해보세요! 아이디어 스케치나 경쟁 앱 분석에도 아주 유용할 거예요.</div>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>2. 자동 디자인 명세서: 문서 작업은 이제 AI에게!</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발 과정에서 가장 지루하고 번거로운 작업 중 하나가 바로 디자인 명세서 작성일 거예요. 일일이 스크린샷 붙여넣고, 각 컴포넌트의 기능과 데이터를 설명하고... 생각만 해도 한숨이 나오죠?

UI, 즉 사용자 인터페이스를 만드는 데 특화된 제가 직접 만든 전문적인 디자인 툴입니다. 마치 어릴 적 레고 블록을 조립하듯, 미리 만들어진 다양한 UI 컴포넌트들을 캔버스 위에 자유롭게 배치하면서 나만의 앱 화면을 직관적으로 디자인할 수 있어요. 버튼, 입력창, 이미지 박스는 물론이고, 조금 더 복잡한 차트까지 없는 게 없답니다. 그냥 마우스로 끌어다 놓기만 하면 끝이에요!\n여기서 제가 정말 중요하다고 생각하는 점은, 이 툴이 단순히 '보이는 대로 그리는' 것에 그치지 않는다는 거예요. 각각의 컴포넌트에는 실제 앱처럼 동작할 수 있는 고유한 속성과 데이터가 담겨있습니다. 이것은 곧, 여러분이 만드는 디자인이 단순한 그림이 아니라, 실제 개발로 바로 이어질 수 있는 '살아있는 설계도'가 된다는 의미예요. 기획자와 디자이너, 개발자 사이에 늘 존재했던 그 복잡한 소통 과정을 획기적으로 줄여주는, 그야말로 강력한 다리 역할을 해주는 거죠. 제가 겪어본 바로는, 이런 부분에서 오는 효율성이 정말 어마어마합니다.\n✨ UI 캔버스의 핵심 기능: 두 가지 마법\nUI 캔버스에는 여러분의 앱 개발 경험을 완전히 바꿔놓을 두 가지 핵심 마법 같은 기능이 숨어있어요. 이 기능들 덕분에 '5분 만에 앱 뚝딱'이라는 말이 절대 과장이 아니게 됩니다.\n1. AI 이미지 분석: 캡처 이미지를 살아있는 앱으로\n길을 걷다 발견한 멋진 앱 디자인, 혹은 웹사이트에서 본 인상 깊은 UI. 그저 한 장의 스크린샷이나 이미지가 순식간에 실제 작동하는 UI 컴포넌트로 변신하는 현실을 상상해 보셨나요? UI 캔버스의 첫 번째 마법이 바로 이겁니다. 캡처 이미지를 업로드하기만 하면, 제가 제미나이 AI와 협력하여 헤더, 버튼, 입력창 등 각 요소의 기능과 관계를 정밀하게 분석해요.\n그리고 몇 초 만에! 믿기 어렵겠지만, 몇 초 만에 작동하는 UI 컴포넌트로 화면을 완벽하게 재구성해 줍니다. 이건 단순히 이미지를 베끼는 것을 넘어섭니다. AI가 디자인의 의도와 구조를 파악해서 마치 리버스 엔지니어링을 하는 것처럼, 새로운 창조의 과정을 만들어낸다고 보시면 돼요. 솔직히 저도 처음 이 기능을 구현했을 때 정말 놀랐답니다.\n\n\n  팁: 영감을 얻은 이미지가 있다면 주저 말고 업로드해보세요! 아이디어 스케치나 경쟁 앱 분석에도 아주 유용할 거예요.\n2. 자동 디자인 명세서: 문서 작업은 이제 AI에게!\n개발 과정에서 가장 지루하고 번거로운 작업 중 하나가 바로 디자인 명세서 작성일 거예요. 일일이 스크린샷 붙여넣고, 각 컴포넌트의 기능과 데이터를 설명하고... 생각만 해도 한숨이 나오죠? UI 캔버스의 두 번째 천재성이 바로 이 부분에 있습니다. 'AI로 내용 채우기' 버튼 하나만 누르면, 여러분의 디자인을 기반으로 완벽한 문서가 뚝딱 완성됩니다!\nAI는 여러분이 만든 디자인을 심층적으로 분석하고, 이 화면이 어떤 목적으로 만들어졌는지 추론합니다. 그래서 앱 이름, 핵심 기능, 타겟 사용자, 심지어 각 컴포넌트의 상세한 동작 방식까지 자동으로 작성해 줘요. AI가 여러분의 디자인에 설득력 있는 스토리를 입혀주는 최고의 스토리텔러가 되어줄 거예요. 기획자와 개발자 간의 소통 오류를 줄이는 데 정말 결정적인 역할을 합니다.\n  UI 캔버스는 누구를 위한 도구일까요?\nUI 캔버스가 특정 전문가만을 위한 도구라고 생각하신다면 오산입니다! 사실 저도 이 툴을 만들면서 '누구나 쉽게'라는 철학을 가장 중요하게 생각했어요. 그래서 복잡한 코딩이나 디자인 지식 없이도 여러분의 아이디어를 현실로 만들고 싶은 모든 분들을 위한 혁신적인 도구라고 할 수 있죠.\n어떤 분들에게 특히 유용할까요? 제 생각에는요,\n아이디어를 빠르게 시각화하고 싶은 기획자: 복잡한 와이어프레임 툴이나 파워포인트 대신, UI 캔버스에서 직접 앱의 흐름과 화면을 구성하며 기획 의도를 명확하게 전달할 수 있어요.\n효율적인 구조 소통을 원하는 개발자: 디자이너와의 협업 과정에서 불필요한 오해를 줄이고, 디자인 명세서를 통해 앱의 구조를 한눈에 파악하며 개발 속도를 높일 수 있습니다.\n복잡한 UI 없이도 멋진 앱 화면을 만들고 싶은 AI 앱 입문자: 코딩은 물론 디자인도 막막한 AI 앱 입문자들에게 UI 캔버스는 훌륭한 첫걸음이 될 거예요. 직관적인 인터페이스로 전문가 같은 결과물을 만들 수 있죠.\n⚠️ 주의: UI 캔버스는 '마법 지팡이'이지만, 앱 개발의 기본 개념 이해는 여전히 중요해요. 하지만 시작은 훨씬 쉽다는 사실!\n  UI 캔버스 탐험: 메인 화면과 주요 기능\n자, 이제 'UI 캔버스'의 메인 화면으로 함께 떠나볼까요? 처음 보시면 \"와, 생각보다 직관적인데?\"라는 말이 절로 나오실 거예요. 크게 세 가지 영역으로 나뉘어 있습니다.\n\n\n\n왼쪽 사이드바: '컴포넌트' 탭을 누르면 버튼, 입력창, 텍스트 등 모든 UI 요소들이 모여있는 툴박스가 나타납니다. 여기서 필요한 요소를 캔버스로 끌어다 놓기만 하면 돼요. '레이어' 탭에서는 포토샵처럼 컴포넌트들의 순서를 쉽게 관리할 수 있죠.\n중앙 캔버스: 여러분의 아이디어가 현실이 될 넓은 무대입니다. 이곳에서 마음껏 UI를 디자인하고 배치하세요.\n오른쪽 속성 패널: 캔버스에서 특정 컴포넌트를 선택하면, 이 패널에서 해당 요소의 색상, 크기, 텍스트 내용 등 아주 세세한 부분까지 모든 속성을 컨트롤할 수 있습니다.\n간단한 조작법을 좀 더 자세히 알아볼까요? 예를 들어, '컴포넌트' 탭에서 버튼을 하나 추가해 볼게요. 그러면 레이어 탭 최상단에 방금 생성한 버튼이 바로 표시됩니다. 이 버튼이 선택된 상태에서 오른쪽 속성 패널에서 버튼의 종류를 바꾸거나, 색상을 지정하고, 텍스트 내용을 수정하는 등 상세 정보를 입력할 수 있어요. 마우스 오른쪽 버튼을 클릭하면 레이어 순서를 변경하거나 복제, 삭제하는 메뉴도 나타나죠.\n특히, 속성 패널의 '설명' 부분에 이 버튼을 클릭했을 때 어떤 동작이 이루어지는지 미리 입력해두면, 나중에 앱을 만들 때 AI가 이를 참고하여 더 정확하게 앱 기능을 구현해 줍니다. 정말 편리하겠죠?\n화면에 컴포넌트가 많아지면 관리하기 어려울 때가 있어요. 이때는 용도별로 컴포넌트들을 그룹으로 묶어두면 아주 편리합니다. 마우스로 화면에 적당한 범위를 지정하고 마우스 오른쪽 메뉴에서 '그룹'을 선택하면 끝! 만들어진 그룹은 필요에 따라 다시 해제할 수도 있습니다. 제 경험상 이런 그룹화 기능이 작업 효율을 크게 높여주더라고요.\n  실전 연습: 나만의 음악 플레이어 만들기 (feat. 5분 뚝딱)\n백문이 불여일견! 제가 아무리 설명해도 직접 해보는 것만큼 좋은 건 없죠. 저와 함께 UI 캔버스를 활용해서 간단한 '음악 플레이어' 앱을 뚝딱 만들어볼까요? 솔직히 5분도 채 안 걸릴 겁니다. 잘 따라와 주세요!\n\n\n1단계: 기본 컨테이너 설정\n먼저, 앱 전체의 외곽을 정의하고 영역을 구분하는 '컨테이너'를 하나 그려줍니다. 컨테이너를 생성한 후에는 다른 요소들이 영향을 주지 않도록 잠금 설정을 하는 걸 추천해요. 이게 작은 팁인데, 나중에 실수하는 걸 막아줍니다.\n2단계: 곡 목록 및 불러오기 버튼 추가\n그다음, 음악 파일 목록을 보여줄 '목록 상자' 컴포넌트를 추가합니다. 속성 패널의 앱 설명에는 '음악 파일 목록 관리'라고 입력해 주세요. 이어서 파일 탐색기를 실행하고 곡을 불러오기 위한 버튼을 추가합니다. 버튼 텍스트는 \"불러오기\"로, 앱 설명에는 '탐색기를 열어 곡 불러오기'라고 상세하게 적어주면 AI가 더 잘 이해하겠죠?\n3단계: 오디오 스펙트럼 및 앱 제목\n음악 플레이어라면 역시 시각적 효과가 중요하죠? 곡이 재생될 때 멋진 비주얼을 위해 '오디오 스펙트럼'을 추가해 봅시다. 만약 컴포넌트 목록에 바로 보이지 않는다면 '기타'를 선택하고 추가하세요. 속성에는 '오디오 스펙트럼 막대형'이라고 입력하면 됩니다. 스펙트럼 위에는 텍스트 컴포넌트를 추가해서 앱의 제목을 \"지피티 팍 플레이어\" 같은 식으로 멋지게 설정해 주세요.\n4단계: 재생 제어 버튼 추가\n이제 음악 재생에 필수적인 버튼들을 추가할 차례입니다. 버튼을 하나 추가한 다음, 2개 더 복제해서 '재생', '이전 곡', '다음 곡' 버튼을 각각 만들고 배치합니다. 각 버튼의 앱 설명에는 해당 버튼이 어떤 기능을 하는지 명확하게 입력하는 것이 중요해요.\n5단계: 디자인 명세서 작성 및 저장\n마지막으로, 이 앱의 디자인 명세서를 작성합니다. 앱의 이름, 구체적인 동작 설명을 입력해야 하는데요, 여기서 핵심은 간단한 설명만 입력한 후 'AI로 내용 채우기' 버튼을 클릭하는 겁니다! 그러면 이전에 여러분이 작업한 디자인을 기반으로 AI가 명세서를 대신 작성해 주니 정말 편리하죠? 작업이 완료되면 오른쪽 상단에 있는 '컴포넌트'와 '디자인 명세 JSON' 버튼을 클릭해서 작업 파일을 저장하세요. 필요하다면 이미지로도 저장이 가능하니 참고해두시면 좋습니다.\n이렇게 디자인한 JSON 파일을 앱 빌더로 가져가서 \"이 파일을 기반으로 한글 앱을 만들어\"라고 입력하면... 놀랍게도 바로 여러분만의 음악 플레이어가 완성됩니다! 정말이지 감탄사가 절로 나오는 경험이었어요.\n \n[GPT PARK MUSIC PLAYER]\n\n \n로그인 - Google 계정\n이메일 또는 휴대전화\naccounts.google.com\n\n \n ️ 이미지 한 장으로 할 일 관리 앱 만들기\n지금부터가 진짜 마법입니다. 혹시 잘 만든 다른 앱 디자인을 참고해서 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들고 싶었던 적 없으셨나요?

        "contentSnippet": "2025년, 유료 AI 서비스 이용료에 대한 걱정이 크셨을 수 있습니다. 데이터 프라이버시 보호, 비용 절감, 그리고 고성능 오픈소스 모델의 지속적인 발전은 '로컬 AI'로의 전환을 단순한 선택이 아닌 필수적인 흐름으로 만들고 있습니다. 본 아티클에서는 로컬 AI에 주목해야 할 다섯 가지 핵심적인 이유를 상세히 다루고자 합니다.\n  로컬 AI 모델, 유료 서비스에 필적하는 성능!\n\n\n오늘날 온라인 AI 도구들은 눈부신 발전을 거듭해왔습니다. 그러나 실제 사용 과정에서 매월 발생하는 구독료가 큰 부담으로 다가오거나, 무료 버전은 제한된 기능과 낮은 성능의 모델만을 제공하는 경우가 빈번합니다. 특정 작업에 특화된 로컬 코딩 AI를 개발하며, GitHub Copilot과 같은 유료 서비스에 의존할 필요가 있을지에 대한 의문이 생겼습니다. 개인 정보 보호와 불합리한 구독료 문제를 고려할 때, 이제는 로컬 환경에서 AI 모델을 운영하는 것이 훨씬 더 현명한 대안이 될 수 있습니다.\n무료 오픈소스, 유료 서비스와 견주다\n최근 오픈소스 AI 생태계는 놀라운 속도로 확장되고 있습니다. GPT-5와 같은 범용적인 '만능' 모델은 아닐지라도, Llama, Mistral, Gemma, DeepSeek 등 여러 모델들은 특정 분야에서 탁월한 성능을 발휘합니다. 이러한 모델들을 사용자 자신의 환경에서 직접 실행함으로써, 각 작업의 특성에 맞춰 가장 적합한 모델을 자유롭게 선택하고 활용하는 유연성을 확보할 수 있습니다. 이는 사용자에게 상당한 편의를 제공합니다.\n이러한 오픈소스 모델들은 유료 AI 서비스와 견주어도 손색없는 역량을 지니고 있습니다. 특정 전문 작업에서는 신중하게 선정된 로컬 오픈소스 모델이 ChatGPT나 GitHub Copilot 같은 클라우드 기반 AI와 동등하거나 그 이상의 성능을 선보이는 사례도 흔합니다. 현재 수백여 종에 달하는 다양한 모델들이 존재하며, 사용자 개개인의 필요에 꼭 맞는 최적의 모델을 선택할 수 있습니다. 단, 모델의 파라미터 수가 증가할수록 요구되는 하드웨어 사양 또한 높아진다는 점은 유념해야 합니다.\n  팁: 로컬 AI 모델 최소 사양 가이드\n일반적으로 다음 사양을 고려하는 것이 좋습니다.\n모델 파라미터 수\n최소 RAM\n\n\n\n\n7B 모델\n최소 8GB RAM\n\n\n13B 모델\n최소 16GB RAM\n\n\n33B 모델\n최소 32GB RAM\n\n\n\n또한, 일부 AI 모델은 용량이 상당히 크므로 넉넉한 디스크 공간을 확보하는 것도 중요해요. 최신 컴퓨터라면 대부분 로컬 AI 모델을 실행할 수 있습니다. 파라미터 수가 낮은 모델은 복잡한 작업을 처리하는 데 한계가 있지만, 훨씬 더 빠르게 사용할 수 있죠. 핵심은 여러분의 요구사항에 맞는 모델을 선택하는 것입니다.\n  로컬 AI, 간편하게 시작할 수 있어요!\n이토록 강력한 AI 모델들을 개인 컴퓨터에서 구동하는 과정이 복잡할 것이라는 오해가 있을 수 있습니다. 하지만 LM Studio나 Ollama와 같은 사용자 친화적인 애플리케이션 덕분에 로컬 LLM의 이점을 누리는 것은 놀라울 정도로 간단합니다. 이러한 도구들은 다양한 오픈소스 AI 모델에 대한 접근을 용이하게 하며, 모델 다운로드 및 실행 과정을 간편하게 지원합니다.\nLM Studio: 로컬 AI를 위한 직관적인 플랫폼\n필자는 개인적으로 직관적인 GUI를 제공하는 LM Studio를 선호합니다. 물론 다양한 다른 대안들도 존재하므로, 사용자 본인에게 가장 적합한 도구를 찾아보는 것도 현명한 선택입니다. LM Studio의 설치 및 AI 모델 설정 과정은 매우 직관적이고 간단하게 이루어집니다.\n\n \nLM Studio - Local AI on your computer\nRun local AI models like gpt-oss, Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek privately on your computer.\nlmstudio.ai\n\n \n\n\n  LM Studio 설정 단계\n\n공식 웹사이트에서 LM Studio를 다운로드하여 설치 프로그램을 실행합니다.\n설치 마법사가 나타날 수 있는데, 오른쪽 상단의 회색 'Skip' 버튼을 클릭하여 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\n주요 인터페이스가 로드되면, LM Studio는 필요한 드라이버나 업데이트를 자동으로 다운로드하기 시작할 거예요. 이 과정이 완료될 때까지 잠시 기다려주세요.\n돋보기 아이콘을 클릭하여 'Discover' 탭을 열고, 다운로드하려는 모델을 검색합니다. 하단 왼쪽의 녹색 'Download' 버튼을 클릭하여 진행합니다.\n모델 다운로드가 완료되면 'Chat' 섹션으로 이동하여 디스플레이 상단의 드롭다운을 클릭해 다운로드한 모델을 로드합니다.\n위의 과정을 마치면, 이제 사용자는 다운로드한 AI 모델과 직접 대화를 시작할 수 있습니다. 선택한 모델의 역량에 따라서는 문서 파일 분석이나 정보 추출과 같은 고급 기능도 활용 가능합니다. LM Studio는 각 모델이 지원하는 기능을 명확하게 안내하므로, 이미지 분석 또는 생성 능력을 갖춘 모델 또한 어렵지 않게 찾아볼 수 있습니다.\n  데이터 프라이버시 완벽 보호, 민감한 작업도 안심!\n많은 사용자들이 이미 다양한 무료 온라인 챗봇을 활용하여 AI 서비스를 이용하고 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 웹 기반 도구들은 사용자 입력 데이터가 서비스 제공업체의 서버로 전송되어 학습에 활용될 수 있다는 본질적인 우려를 안고 있습니다. 이로 인해 코딩과 같이 민감한 정보를 다루는 작업에는 AI를 적용하기 어려운 경우가 발생합니다.\n대부분의 클라우드 기반 AI 챗봇은 정식 구독 없이 생성된 결과물을 상업적으로 이용하는 것을 제한하는 정책을 두고 있습니다. 그러나 로컬 환경에서 AI를 실행할 경우, 이러한 제약으로부터 완전히 벗어날 수 있습니다. 사용자의 AI와의 모든 상호작용은 개인 컴퓨터 내부에서만 이루어지므로, 이전에는 상상하기 어려웠던 다양한 프로젝트에 AI를 안심하고 통합하여 활용할 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ 주의: 웹 기반 AI 사용의 잠재적 위험\n온라인 AI 툴은 편리하지만, 입력 데이터가 서버로 전송되어 학습에 사용될 수 있습니다. 이는 특히 기업 기밀, 개인 정보, 또는 지적 재산권이 포함된 작업에는 큰 위험 요소가 될 수 있으니 항상 유의해야 합니다.\n로컬 AI는 데이터 수집, 사용자 입력 학습, 또는 외부 기업의 모니터링으로부터 완전히 자유롭습니다. 이는 단순한 데이터 프라이버시 보호를 넘어섭니다. 로컬 AI 모델을 운용함으로써 사용자는 데이터 보존 정책이나 정보 오용 가능성에 대한 우려 없이 온전한 창작의 자유를 만끽할 수 있습니다.\n이제 민감한 업무 관련 프로젝트, 개인적인 창작 활동, 그리고 다양한 실험적인 아이디어에 AI를 아무런 걱정 없이 적용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 특히 기업 기밀이나 민감한 데이터를 다루는 전문가들에게는 이러한 강력한 프라이버시 보호 기능만으로도 로컬 AI로의 전환을 고려할 충분한 근거가 될 것입니다.\n\n\n  AI 구독료 해방, 비용 부담에서 벗어나세요!\n매월 반복되는 AI 도구 구독료에 지쳐 있다면, LM Studio와 같은 플랫폼이나 기타 대안을 활용하여 주말 동안 로컬 AI 모델을 체험해보는 것을 강력히 권장합니다. Mistral 7B Instruct나 Gemma 3와 같은 모델들은 로컬 AI를 처음 접하는 사용자에게 훌륭한 시작점이 될 수 있습니다.\n모든 유료 구독을 즉시 중단할 필요는 없습니다. 우선적으로 로컬 AI를 시험해보고, 핵심적인 서비스는 유지하되, 개인의 필요를 충분히 충족시키는 로컬 모델을 발견하면 점진적으로 구독을 줄여나가는 전략을 추천합니다. 필자는 불과 한 달 만에 대부분의 AI 구독 서비스를 해지할 수 있었습니다. 로컬 AI는 온라인 서비스가 제공하기 어려운 독점적인 장점들을 가지고 있으며, 약간의 성능 또는 지능적 역량의 차이가 있더라도 그 가치는 충분히 보상받을 수 있다고 생각합니다.\n이제 더 이상 AI 구독료를 지불할 필요가 없어졌습니다. 이 혜택은 여러분에게도 동일하게 적용될 수 있습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n1. 오픈소스 로컬 AI, 유료 서비스와 견줄 만한 성능!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "경험이 좀 있는 미국 투자자들이 하는 말 중 이런 말이 있다.\n“굶주려서 문 닫는 회사보단, 소화불량으로 문 닫는 회사가 훨씬 더 많다.(More companies die due to indigestion than starvation)”\n\n\n\n\n굳이 설명하지 않아도 이게 무슨 말인지는 대충 알 텐데, 스타트업의 맥락에서 이야기하자면, 돈이(=런웨이) 없어서 문을 닫는 회사도 많지만, 이보다 돈이 너무 많아서 멍청한 짓을 해서(cross out) 문을 닫는 회사가 훨씬 더 많다는 의미다.\n내가 처음에 이 말을 들었을 때 나는 약 3년 차 VC였다. 그리고 솔직히, 이게 무슨 말인지 잘 이해를 못 했다. 돈이 없어서 스타트업이 문을 닫지, 돈이 많은데 어떻게 회사가 망하는지 잘 이해가 안 갔다. 더 많은 사람을 채용하고, 더 많은 영업과 마케팅을 하고, 더 많은 제품을 만들면 당연히 매출도 늘어나고 더 잘 되는 게 아닌가. 도대체 이게 무슨 말인지 잘 몰랐다.\n하지만, 이제 14년 차 VC인 내가 이 말을 들으면 그냥 자동으로 고개가 끄덕거려진다. 그리고, 그동안 투자를 너무 많이 받고 돈이 너무 많아져서, 소화불량으로 어려워진 우리 투자사들이 했던 멍청한 짓들이 비디오같이 내 머릿속에서 재생된다. 이 중 많은 회사들이 망했고, 일부 회사들은 아직 살아 있지만, 과거의 실수를 만회하느라 아직도 허덕거리는 곳들이 상당히 많다.\n과식해서 소화불량으로 – 즉, 투자를 너무 많이 받아서 – 죽거나 힘들어하는 회사들의 공통점이 몇 가지 있다. 이 회사들은 주로 시장에 유동성이 과하게 높았던 시기에 약간 말도 안 되게 높은 밸류에이션에 필요 이상의 투자를 받았다. 시작부터 이러니, 마치 본인들이 정말로 사업을 잘해서 이런 높은 밸류에이션에 투자받은 거로 착각하는데, 사업을 못 했으면 투자를 못 받았을 테니, 사업을 잘하는 건 맞지만, 그렇다고 그렇게 높은 밸류를 받을 정도의 대단한 사업은 아니었다. 이렇게 필요 이상의 투자금을 받은 창업가들은 대부분 돈의 가치를 잘 이해하지 못한다. 본인들이 평생 일을 해도 200억 원이라는 돈을 만져보지도 못할 텐데, 갑자기 회사 통장에 200억 원이 입금되면 이 돈의 무게를 그대로 느끼지 못하고, 너무 우습게 생각하는 걸 나는 자주 목격했다.\n그리고 갑자기 큰돈이 생기면, 이들은 돈이 없었으면 절대로 할 생각도 하지 않았을 일들을 벌리기 시작한다. 즉, 위에서 말한 대로, 아주 멍청한 짓들을 하기 시작하는 것이다. 왜냐하면, 그냥 돈이 있어서 할 수 있기 때문이다. 딱히 사람이 필요 없는데, 네이버, 카카오, 토스, 쿠팡 같은 곳으로부터 몸값이 엄청나게 비싼 임원들을 회사로 영입한다. 이런 분들이 필요하면 당연히 비싸게 돈을 주고 채용해야겠지만, 그냥 돈이 너무 많으니까, 사람들을 막 데려온다. 그리고 본업과는 상관없는 방향의 제품을 개발하기 시작하고, 주변의 다른 회사를 인수하기 시작한다. 왜 이러냐고 물어보면, 답변은 항상 논리적이고 똑똑하다. 결국엔 그 방향으로 확장해야지만 유니콘 기업이 될 수 있는데, 하나씩 하면 시간이 너무 오래 걸려서 좋은 회사들을 ‘싸게’ 인수한다는 답변을 나는 꽤 자주 들었다. 그리고 이걸 가능케 하기 위해 더 많은 인력을 채용하고, 이들을 모두 수용하기 위해서 더 크고 더 좋은 사무실로 이사 가거나, 어쩔 땐 사옥을 매입하기도 한다.\n그러면서 서서히 소화불량으로 회사가 죽는 걸 나는 꽤 많이 봤다. 왜 이 회사의 투자자인 스트롱은 이걸 그대로 두고 봤냐고 물어본다면, 솔직히 나도 할 말은 없다. 당시엔 나는 이렇게 하는 게 맞다고 믿었고, 돈 다 쓰면 또 투자받으면 된다는 안일한 생각을 했다. 굉장히 위험한 생각이고, 굉장히 멍청한 생각이었다. 이제 나는 회사의 퍼포먼스 대비 너무 높은 밸류에 너무 많은 투자를 받는 우리 투자사가 있으면 이 회사가 과식하고 소화불량으로 죽지 않게 각별히 주의한다.\n돈이 다 떨어졌고, 도저히 펀드레이징이 안 되는 회사가 서서히 죽어가는 건 어쩔 수가 없다. 이런 회사는 배가 너무 고프지만, 뭘 사 먹을 돈이 없어서 계속 굶는다. 그런데 많은 경우에 이런 회사들이 오히려 물만 먹으면서 오랫동안 살아남는 경우를 봤다. 반면에 갑자기 너무 돈이 많이 생겨서, 배가 고프지도 않은데 계속 뭔가 먹다가 과식해서 소화불량으로 급체해서 죽는 회사들이 더 많다는 사실을 모든 창업가는 기억하길 바란다.\n너무 허기져도 안 되고, 너무 배가 불러도 안 된다. 항상 적당히 먹어서 잘 소화하고 건강해야 한다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "올해 나는 엘리트 운동선수들의 팟캐스트를 꽤 많이 들었다. 인간의 육체적, 정신적 한계를 극복하고 세계 최고의 운동선수가 된 사람들의 이야기를 들으면 들을수록 엘리트 운동선수와 창업가 간엔 공통점이 너무나 많다는 생각을 계속하게 된다. 가장 대표적인 공통점은 내가 자주 이야기하는 ‘극강의 바퀴벌레력’이다. 그중에서도 생존력과 회복력이 바퀴벌레, 창업가, 그리고 엘리트 운동선수가 태어날 때부터 보유하고 있는 천성, 또는 성장하면서 남들보다 더 잘 발달시킨 후천적 습성이라고 생각하는데, 이들은 지구상의 그 어떤 생명체보다 살아남는 능력과 넘어지면 또 일어나는 능력이 강하다.\n한 팟캐스트에서 들었던 이 부분이 계속 내 뇌리를 맴돌면서 기억에 강력하게 남았다.\n“평범한 운동선수는 그냥 보통의 선수지만, 탁월한 운동선수들은 ‘반복의 기계’이다.(Ordinary athletes are just athletes, but extraordinary athletes are ‘machines of iteration’”\n\n\n\n\n이게 무슨 말이냐 하면, 탁월한 운동선수들은 같은 동작을 끊임없이 반복한다는 의미다. 말콤 글래드웰의 1만 시간의 법칙에 따라서 생각해 보면 카를로스 알카라스 같은 탁월한 테니스 선수는 포핸드 하나만 2만 시간 이상 반복 연습한다. 손흥민 선수는 왼발 감아차기를 아마도 수천 번 반복 연습할 것이다. 스테판 커리는 3점 슛을 수만 번 반복 연습할 것이다. 이 선수들은 그 동작이 신체 일부가 될 때까지 계속 반복해서 ‘반복의 기계’가 되고, 이런 과정에서 평범한 선수에서 탁월한 선수가 되는 것이다.\n‘반복의 기계(machines of iteration)’라는 말이 나에게 정말 인상 깊게 다가왔고, 내 안에서 아주 오랫동안 남았는데, 그 이유는 아마도 내가 요새 아주 많이 생각하고, 스스로에게 아주 많이 물어보는 질문에 대한 해답일지도 모르겠다는 느낌이 왔기 때문이다.\n평범한(ordinary) VC가 어떻게 하면 탁월한(extraordinary) VC가 될 수 있을지 나는 요새 굉장히 많이 생각하고 고민한다. 어렴풋이 그냥 열심히 하면 된다는 건 알겠지만, 여기서 조금 더 구체적으로 들어가고 싶었는데, ‘반복의 기계’라는 표현이 내 생각을 매우 깔끔하게 정리해 주는 해답이라는 느낌이 강하게 들었다.\n평범한 VC는 어떻게 하면 반복의 기계가 되면서 탁월한 VC가 될까? 내가 내린 결론은 아주 간단하다. 다른 VC보다 이메일을 더 많이 쓰고, 더 많은 창업가를 만나고, 더 많이 일하면 된다. 딱 이 세 가지만 하면 되는데, 이 세 가지는 그렇게 어려운 게 아니다. 실은, 생각보다 쉽다. 하지만, 정말 어려운 건 이 세 가지를 10년 동안 매일 반복해서 내 몸의 일부가 되게 만드는 것이다. 즉, 반복의 기계가 돼야 하는데, 이게 정말 어려운 일이다.\n남들보다 하루에 이메일을 하나만 더 쓰면, 10년이면 남보다 3,650개의 이메일을 더 쓸 수 있다.\n남들보다 하루에 미팅을 하나만 더 하면, 10년이면 남보다 3,650명의 창업가를 더 만날 수 있다.\n남들보다 하루에 한 시간만 더 일하면, 10년이면 남보다 3,650시간을 더 일 할 수 있다.\n위의 수치는 실로 엄청난 숫자이고, 이렇게 하면 반복의 기계가 될 수 있고, 탁월한 VC가 될 수 있다. 그리고, 이런 훈련과 반복을 통해서 탁월한 VC가 될 수 있다면, 다른 평범한 VC는 절대로 우릴 이길 수가 없을 것이다.\n이미 나는 스트롱을 통해서 이 여정을 시작했다. 언제 완성될지 모르겠지만, 엘리트 운동선수들같이 반복의 기계가 되는 그 순간을 매일 꿈꾼다.\n사실 이건 운동선수나 VC만의 이야기가 아니다. 우리 모두에게 적용되는 인생의 원칙이다.",
