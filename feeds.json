        "content:encodedSnippet": "Penetration testing (or “pen testing”) is an authorized, simulated cyberattack designed to test the security of a production system.\nEthical hackers perform penetration tests, emulating the behavior of cybercriminals to evaluate your software’s security and identify any weaknesses. During a pen test, these cybersecurity specialists use a range of techniques to attack a system. \n\nOnce they have gained access, their goal is to demonstrate the potential damage that somebody could do during a real attack.\nPenetration testing is an effective way to identify and prioritize security flaws in your software, protecting both your organization and users from cyberattacks.\n💡 See also: SAST vs DAST: Differences And When to Use\nWhy is penetration testing important?\nCybercriminals typically seek to steal sensitive data, such as company IP, financial information, or users’ data, and/or disrupt operations. A successful cyberattack can result in serious reputational and financial damage (enough to jeopardize the future of your business) and may also expose you to liability and regulatory penalties.\nWith cyberattacks becoming increasingly common, the importance of software security cannot be overstated. A penetration test provides a realistic assessment of how well your system will withstand a cyberattack and identifies weaknesses that you should address.\n❓ Why penetration testing matters: risk vs. resilience\n\nWithout penetration testingWith penetration testing\n❌ Unknown vulnerabilities remain hidden in your code or infrastructure✅ Known exploits are identified before attackers can abuse them\n⚠️ High risk of data breaches, IP theft, or operational disruption🛡️ Stronger defenses built around real attack simulations\n💸 Financial losses from fines, lawsuits, or ransom demands💼 Demonstrated compliance with ISO27001, HIPAA, and other standards\n📉 Reputational damage after publicized incidents📈 Customer trust reinforced through visible due diligence\n⏳ Delayed response to incidents you didn’t anticipate🚀 Faster remediation guided by expert pen test reports\n\n\n\n\n\nAn external penetration testing service will provide a detailed report of the attempted attacks, the exploits found, and the potential harm that could be inflicted.\nAs a proven security testing technique, penetration testing is recommended by several security standards and regulations, including ISO27001 and HIPAA. Running regular pen tests (and acting on the findings) can be used to demonstrate due diligence and compliance with these standards.\nBlack box, white box, and gray box penetration testing\nDepending on your goals, you can run penetration tests using a black box, white box, or gray box approach. The different approaches refer to the amount of information provided to the pen testers in advance of the exercise.\nBlack box testing\nAlso known as opaque box or blind testing, this approach simulates an attack by an outsider. In a black box test, the pen testers are given only the name of the organization or product under test. It’s then up to them to glean whatever information they can to mount an attack.\nTo make the test even more realistic, you can run a double-blind pen test, in which employees of your organization are unaware that the test is happening.\n\nGray box testing\nIn a semi-opaque or gray box test, pen testers are given some information in advance. This might include system diagrams or design documents, or potentially credentials for a part of the system or a related service. Taking a gray box approach simulates an attack following a leak of confidential information or the actions of a disgruntled employee.\nWhite box testing\nWith a transparent or white box approach, pen testers have access to all the source code, binaries, containers, and any other artifacts of the system. While not a realistic attack, a white box penetration test is the quickest way to conduct this type of test and can be useful if you want rapid feedback so you can address security flaws quickly. \nOnce you have addressed any issues, you may want to follow up with a black box test to ensure nothing has been missed.\nVulnerability scanning vs. penetration testing\nAn effective cybersecurity strategy should involve multiple levels of security testing. This includes both automated vulnerability scans, such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), as well as manual techniques like pen testing.\nVulnerability scanners check your source code or software systematically for known security flaws. Because they are reasonably quick to run and require no manual intervention, they are ideal for inclusion in your automated CI/CD pipeline. \n🧪 Vulnerability scanning vs. penetration testing\n\nAspectVulnerability scanningPenetration testing\nTypeAutomatedManual\nTechniquesSAST, DAST, predefined rule setsSimulated real-world attacks by ethical hackers\nScopeSource code, known vulnerabilitiesEntire system: code, infrastructure, social engineering, physical security\nDetection abilityFast and repeatable; ideal for frequent useSlow; time-intensive due to human effort\nCostLow; can run in every CI/CD cycleHigh; typically done a few times a year\nIdeal use caseContinuous feedback in CI/CD pipelineIn-depth analysis for high-risk releases or compliance needs\nLimitationsDoesn’t test exploit feasibility or user behaviorNot scalable for every build; limited frequency\nBest when combined withPenetration testing for real-world attack simulationAutomated scans for consistent baseline coverage\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ensures you get regular and rapid feedback on each set of code changes, allowing you to address any new security issues quickly and efficiently.\nOn the other hand, automated security scans can only ever discover the issues they’ve been programmed to detect. As a result, they cannot identify new vulnerabilities or combinations of exploits. The fully automated process also carries a higher risk of false positives. This is where pen testing can offer advantages.\nPenetration testing is a form of manual security testing that involves skilled individuals mounting realistic attacks on your system. In addition to checking for common vulnerabilities, pen testers often chain exploits together, leveraging each small weakness in the same way an attacker would to gain access to a system.\nPen testers also look beyond the codebase, exploiting social engineering tactics and physical security gaps to compromise systems. As a result, penetration tests can reveal flaws in your defenses that might go unnoticed by automated security tests.\nThe downside of pen tests is that they are expensive and time-consuming to run. How frequently you run penetration tests will depend on your risk profile and budget, but it is typically a few times a year or less.If you’re releasing changes frequently, penetration testing alone is not enough to defend against cyberattacks. \nHowever, by combining pen testing with vulnerability scans and other automated security tests, you can leverage the benefits of each approach. \n💡 Find out more about automated testing from our CI/CD guide.\nTypes of penetration testing\nPen testing can involve a range of methods. Rather than focusing on a particular type to the exclusion of others, pen testers combine different methods according to the system under test and the organization’s requirements.\nExternal vs. internal\nIn an external penetration test, the simulated attack starts from outside the organization’s network. The initial target might be a router, external servers, employee computers, or cloud-hosted services. The pen tester aims to find a way in and then see what else they can access and what damage they can do.\nBy contrast, an internal test starts from inside the network. You can use this to simulate an attack by a rogue employee or an attack that could follow a successful phishing attempt.\nApplication testing\nApplication testing involves looking for vulnerabilities in deployed software, such as web apps, mobile apps, APIs, and IoT devices. Pen testers will look for common security flaws, such as SQL injection, broken authentication, and others listed in the OWASP Top 10.\nAlthough vulnerability scans can detect these types of issues, fixes are sometimes deprioritized if they are not considered a significant threat. However, minor exploits can be chained together by a creative pen tester to reveal a viable attack vector.\nSocial engineering\nSocial engineering targets the individuals working at an organization. Attack vectors include phishing emails and phone calls to extract valuable information and credentials, tailgating staff entering the building, or cloning office badges (often with the help of photos on social media) and masquerading as an employee or contractor.\nPhysical security\nPhysical security can involve searching for vulnerabilities in hardware, such as unpatched servers, or simply gaining entry to premises and then plugging a device into a network socket. \nOnce a pen tester has gained access to the network in this way, they can seek to access key systems with the help of malware or key loggers, and then download or take screenshots of sensitive data.\nHow to do penetration testing\nMost pen testers will follow a process that includes the following steps.\n\n\n\n\nRules of engagement\nBefore starting, the pen testers should agree on a brief with the organization that defines the test’s target and the rules of engagement. This should include what forms of testing are acceptable and what is off the table (such as phishing attempts on staff or forcing entry to premises), as well as the contact to inform of progress. \nThe brief should also provide any additional context (in the case of a white or gray box test) and specify whether employees are aware that a pen test is being run.\nPlanning and reconnaissance\nBased on the brief, the pen testing team will collect as much information as possible about the software. This may include scouring public websites, published documentation, social media accounts, and public repositories to learn more about the software architecture and how it’s hosted. \nThey will also gather intelligence about the organization and look for ways to get into the network so they can access key systems and data.\nOnce the reconnaissance is complete, the pen testers identify potential attack vectors and prioritize them, while considering how to evade detection at all stages of the exercise.\nGaining access\nThe pen testing team then attempts to gain access to the system through any means allowed in the brief. During this stage, they may use various tools to automate specific elements of the process, including vulnerability scanners, credential cracking tools, port scanners, and network analyzers.\nIf permitted by the rules of engagement, they may use social engineering techniques to gain access to premises and attempt to install malware on devices within the network so they can continue the attack remotely.\nMaintaining access\nOnce inside, pen testers attempt to escalate privileges and access critical systems or demonstrate the potential to disrupt them.\nRemaining undetected throughout this process is crucial – if somebody discovered a real hacker, they could avert the attack. The longer a pen tester can remain undetected, the higher the risk that an advanced persistent threat could be carried out.\nCovering tracks\nBefore concluding, pen testers remove all traces of their activity. This both tests the organization’s ability to detect intrusions and ensures nothing remains for real attackers to exploit. This might involve removing any hardware or malware they have planted, and reverting any configurations to their original state.\nReporting\nFinally, the pen testers will write a report detailing what they attempted, the defenses that worked, how they managed to gain access, and the damage they could have caused. \nThey may provide evidence of how far they penetrated the defenses by placing a file in a secure location or taking a screenshot of sensitive data. They will also suggest recommendations on how you can enhance your security and prevent similar attacks in the future.\nPopular penetration testing tools\nAlthough penetration testing is a form of manual security testing, pen testers typically use many tools to simulate an attack, just as a malicious actor would. By using these tools on your systems, you can also detect potential vulnerabilities and address them before they’re exploited.\nReconnaissance tools\nDuring the reconnaissance phase, pen testers may use network scanners, like Nmap, to scan IP addresses and ports to find out more about the system design and identify potential entry points. \nNetwork packet analyzers, such as Wireshark, are used to gain a deeper understanding of the systems in use and look for sensitive data or credentials being transmitted without encryption.\nCredential cracking\nTools designed to crack encryption protocols or mount brute force attacks, such as Hydra and John the Ripper, are frequently used to try to gain access to systems. Other options include installing key loggers on employees’ devices or using phishing emails to trick users into divulging their credentials.\nExploitation tools\nTools such as Metasploit, Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP enable pen testers to automate common attacks including SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and fuzzing. Having identified a vulnerability, pen testers may then chain several exploits together to mount a more sophisticated attack.\nBusiness perspective: the ROI of penetration testing\nPenetration testing is often seen as a technical requirement, but it can also be viewed as a business safeguard. A successful cyberattack can lead to downtime, reputational damage, regulatory fines, or loss of sensitive data. In some cases, the financial impact may exceed the cost of a structured penetration testing program.\nWhile vulnerability scans are useful for identifying known issues, penetration testing simulates how an attacker might exploit multiple weaknesses in combination. This type of testing can uncover risks that are difficult to detect through automation alone.\nFor organizations operating in regulated industries, penetration testing may also support compliance with standards such as ISO27001, HIPAA, and PCI DSS. In this context, it can be used to demonstrate due diligence and reduce legal exposure.\nWhen penetration testing pays for itself\nAlthough penetration tests can be expensive to run, they are often justified in scenarios with elevated risk. \nThese include:\nLaunching a new product or major architectural change\nStoring or processing sensitive information, such as personal data or payment details\nPreparing for a security certification or compliance audit\nFollowing a publicized security incident affecting a competitor or similar company\nExpanding into new infrastructure environments, such as third-party APIs or cloud services\nIn such cases, the cost of remediation after a breach may significantly outweigh the cost of identifying and fixing issues earlier through targeted testing.\nCombining pen testing with automated security scanning\nPenetration testing offers detailed insight into your security posture, but it is not designed for continuous use. To maintain security at scale, it’s best used in combination with automated tools.\nFor example, vulnerability scanners can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to provide regular feedback on source code and deployed software. This allows you to identify common issues quickly, without the need for manual intervention.\n💡Read also: What Is a CI/CD Pipeline?\nPen testers, on the other hand, can focus on exploring complex attack paths, misconfigurations, or issues that are specific to your architecture. This combination ensures broader coverage while making efficient use of internal or third-party security resources.\nTools such as OWASP ZAP or Snyk can be added to your build process, while platforms like TeamCity allow you to automate scanning tasks and generate reports at each deployment stage.\nSetting up TeamCity Snyk plugin",

In this edition, Piotr Przybył joins us in the Featured Content section to share his cultivated list of content finds. We’re also testing a new, more concise format that is faster to read but still packed with value. Let us know if you like it or miss the old style. \nReady? Let’s go!\nFeatured Content\nPiotr Przybył\nPiotr Przybył – Notorious engineer at work and after hours, tracing the meanders of the art of software engineering. Remote Software Gardener, mostly working in web-oriented Java gardens. Java Champion. Testcontainers Champion. Programming usually in Java (since 1.3), Scala, and Go, but in other languages too. A fan of agility, seen mostly as choosing the right tools and approaches after asking the right questions. Developer, trainer, and conference speaker, currently working for Elastic as a Senior Developer Advocate.\nGreetings, fellow Java developers! It’s a pleasure to be here. It’s exciting to be in the Java community, for a language that celebrated its 30th anniversary, which has been proclaimed to be dead so many times, and it’s still doing surprisingly well. We can see that with all the exciting stuff happening around Java 25, and changes in the ecosystem at large.\nI’m humbled and honoured to be here. It’s great to see the community and the ecosystem evolve, especially given that I’ve been a part of it since (checks notes…) 2003 ;-)\nI was first exposed to Java at my alma mater, Wrocław University of Science and Technology. Recently, there’s been one more reason to be a proud alumnus: “Odra 5”!\n“Odra 5” is the name of Poland’s first quantum computer, recently launched at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology. It’s a five-qubit machine, developed by Finnish company IQM Quantum Computers, that represents a significant milestone in the advancement of quantum computing in Central and Eastern Europe. I find the name cute and not without meaning for local IT history fans. You can read more about it here at the University’s official page. Also, “Odra” is the Polish name for the Oder river, and… computers manufactured in Wrocław in the 1960s.\nLet’s get back from general Computer Science to Java. Unless you have been living in total wilderness, I think you might have heard a thing or two about the AI (r)evolution happening recently. ;-) Contrary to some rumours, Java is a very decent language that benefits from improvements in this area, and with the release of Spring AI 1.0, things will get even easier! The article by Josh Long, Philipp Krenn, and Laura Trotta (I know, and have lots of respect for all of them) will let you understand how to start with your own RAG quickly, benefiting from features of Spring AI, Elasticsearch, and more. Oh, and if you’d like to learn more about stuff like vector search or searching in general, AI, and so on, Elasticsearch Labs might be a good place to start.\nSpeaking about Java itself, there’s of course the 30th anniversary of Java! It’s a big thing, although it might be disturbing to some that the language that keeps dying is still pretty much alive and actively developed. Right now, there are 17 active Java Enhancement Proposals targeting Java 25, which in my opinion proves that despite its size and legacy, the Java ecosystem is still evolving fast. I couldn’t resist, and wrote about Java’s Structured Concurrency, Elasticsearch Java client, DevEx, and a Developer Advocate’s job on my personal page, touching on all of this.\nI think that some reasons why our ecosystem is still robust are that we can learn from our past mistakes. While some of them are irreversible, many of them can shape how we think and evolve our systems and our daily jobs. A great example is the Allegro folks sharing how to avoid mistakes in Gradle, because with flexibility comes responsibility. And also, our tech stack and our jobs are not only the language, the SDK, the frameworks, and build/CI/CD tools, but predominantly our mindset. That’s something we shall all keep improving!\nJava News\nCheck out the most recent news from the Java world: \nJava News Roundup 1, 2, 3, 4\nJava at 30: A Retrospective on a Language That Has Made a Big Impact \nFoojay Podcast #71: Celebrating 30 Years of Java with James Gosling\nJava 30 by JetBrains\nHappy 30th Birthday, Java!\nJava’s 30th Birthday\nJava at 30: The Genius Behind the Code That Changed Tech\nStrings Just Got Faster\nJEP targeted to JDK 25: 511: Module Import Declarations\nJEP targeted to JDK 25: 512: Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods\nJEP targeted to JDK 25: 505: Structured Concurrency (5th Preview)\nJEP targeted to JDK 25: 513: Flexible Constructor Bodies\nJava 25 Introduces Stable Values API for Deferred Immutability and Improved Application Startup \nInstance Main Methods Move from Preview to Final in JDK 25\nJEP 510: Key Derivation Function API\nStructured Concurrency Revamp in Java 25 – Inside Java Newscast #91\nJava Tutorials and Tips\nLearn new things and enjoy unique insights from industry experts: \nEpisode 35 “Stream Gatherers” with Viktor Klang\nOracle’s new certification exam engine\nAdoption of the Model Context Protocol Within the Java Ecosystem\nPresentation: Stream All the Things — Patterns of Effective Data Stream Processing\nJavaFX 24 and Beyond\nGarbage Collection in Java: The Performance Benefits of Upgrading\nMastering JVM Memory Troubleshooting – From OutOfMemoryErrors to Leaks\nEpisode 36 “Ahead of Time Computation” with Dan Heidinga\nJava 24, Faster Than Ever\nStructured Concurrency in Action\nPattern Matching in Java: Better Code, Better APIs\nTowards a JSON API for the JDK\nKotlin Corner\nEverything you might have missed about Kotlin in May:\nKotlinConf 2025 Unpacked: Upcoming Language Features, AI-Powered Development, and Kotlin Multiplatform Upgrades\nMeet Koog: Empowering Kotlin Developers to Build AI Agents \nStrengthening Kotlin for Backend Development: A Strategic Partnership With Spring Present and Future of Kotlin for Web \nAmper Update, May’25 \nHow to Use Kotlin Notebooks for Productive Development \nStructuring Ktor Projects Using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Concepts \nKotlin LSP – The launch of the pre-Alpha Kotlin LSP and VS Code plugin. \nAI\nLearn more about the most recent AI news, innovations, problems, and predictions:\nA Practical Guide on Effective AI Use – AI as Your Peer Programmer\nWorking with Junie in legacy code\nHelp Predict the Future of AI in Software Development!\nVibe coding an MCP server with Micronaut, LangChain4j, and Gemini\nJava for AI\nBuild AI Apps and Agents in Java: Hands-On with LangChain4j\nFrom Architecture to Deployment: How AI-Powered Toolkits Are Unifying Developer Workflows\nPodcast: How To Improve the Quality of the Gen AI-Generated Code And Your Team’s Dynamics\nGenAI blood, sweat, and tears: Loading data to Pinecone\nMeet Koog: Empowering Kotlin Developers to Build AI Agents\nJetBrains AI Assistant – Now in Visual Studio Code\nWrite AI agents in Java — Agent Development Kit getting started guide\nHow to send prompts in bulk with Spring AI and Java Virtual Threads\nBeyond the chatbot or AI sparkle: a seamless AI integration\nAI Test Generation: A Dev’s Guide Without Shooting Yourself in the Foot\nThings you never dared to ask about LLMs — Take 2\nEthics in AI’s Wild West: Biases & Responsibilities\nContext Collection Competition by JetBrains and Mistral AI\nBrokk: AI for Large (Java) Codebases \nLanguages, Frameworks, Libraries, and Technologies\nGet to know programming technologies and frameworks better:\nThis Week in Spring 1, 2, 3, 4\nHow to send prompts in bulk with Spring AI and Java Virtual Threads\nDynamic Tool Updates in Spring AI’s Model Context Protocol\nGradle Best Practices – A Path to Build Happiness\nSemantic Search with Spring Boot & Redis\nLocal AI with Spring: Building Privacy-First Agents Using Ollama\nA Bootiful Podcast: V Körbes on security from the platform on up\nWhat is RAG, and How to Secure It\nConferences and Events\nHere are some of the must-attend online and offline events in June:\nIntelliJ IDEA Conf – Online, June 3–4\nJ-Spring – Utrecht, Netherlands, June 5;

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Developer experience (DevEx) and developer productivity (DP) are hot topics. Many companies are already working actively to measure and improve them, while others, if not already doing this, are at least aware of them. However, what we’re interested in is what’s really happening inside companies when it comes to DevEx and DP.\nTo get a clearer picture, we incorporated a range of questions on DevEx and DP into our annual Developer Ecosystem Survey (about 20,000 developers all over the world have submitted responses to this survey). The results are rather revealing. While there’s growing awareness of these topics, especially within larger companies, our research uncovered some gaps and blind spots. We believe that understanding what these are and how to overcome them will prove useful for our users and customers.\nHere are three key insights from our research:\nHow developers really feel about being measured? Most developers are generally okay with their productivity assessments as long as they are done transparently and fairly.\nDeveloper satisfaction with tools: desired but not measured. 55% of developers either don’t have their satisfaction with tools measured, or don’t know if it’s being measured.\nTeam leads are carrying the burden of DevEx and DP, but should they? 51% of developers and 67% of tech leads agree that team leads are the primary drivers of DevEx and DP measurement.\nHow developers really feel about being measured\nIt’s easy to assume that developers might feel uncomfortable about the fact that their productivity and developer experience are being measured. After all, who enjoys being evaluated? But here’s the good news: most developers are generally okay with these assessments as long as they are done transparently and fairly.\nOur research shows that 42% of developers feel comfortable with productivity assessments, while 40% report neutral feelings on the subject. That means only a small percentage actively dislike being assessed. And even then, the real problem isn’t measurement itself, it’s how it’s done.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common frustration? A lack of transparency.\nDevelopers want to know how their work is being evaluated, why and what decision will be made based on it. Yet our data suggests that nearly half of developers (46%) don’t fully understand how their productivity data is used in decision-making. Without this clarity, these efforts risk being perceived as arbitrary or unfair.\nAmong other issues are a lack of constructive feedback following assessments and the use of methods and metrics that are sub-optimal from developers’ perspective.\nDevelopers want actionable insights based on the results of evaluations so they can grow and improve. And many companies still solely rely on activity-based measurements like counting commits or code changes, that provide a limited overview of productivity and offer little value for meaningful feedback.\n\n\n\n\nDeveloper satisfaction with tools: desired but not measured\nWhat’s one of the biggest contributors to a great developer experience? Good tools. When tools are smooth, functionable, and reliable, developer frictions are minimized. When tools are slow, hard to use and unstable, developer frictions (long feedback loops, high cognitive load, inability to get into the flow state) flourish.\nYet, our research shows that 55% of developers either don’t have their satisfaction with tools measured, or don’t know if it’s being measured. This is upsetting. If companies aren’t paying attention to satisfaction with tools, how can they improve developer experience?\n\n\n\n\nWhy is this a problem?\nDevelopers spend hours every day working with their tools. Small inefficiencies add up quickly. And frustration with tools potentially leads to lower productivity and even attrition. If a developer struggles with inefficient workflows for too long, feeling unproductive and not cared about, they may eventually just leave for a company that prioritizes developer experience and cares about developers.\nTeam leads are carrying the burden of DevEx and DP, but should they?\nWhen it comes to developer productivity and developer experience, who is actually responsible? In most companies, regardless of size, team leads take (or are expected to take) ownership of these efforts. Our data shows that 51% of developers and 67% of tech leads agree that team leads are the primary drivers of DevEx and DP measurement.\nThis looks as a logical choice, team leads work closely with developers and understand their challenges. But there’s a question: are team leads actually ready to take on this responsibility? How well-equipped and trained are they for this task, do they have real authority to influence company-wide decisions regarding tools, DP, and DevEx? Or has this responsibility been pushed onto them without real sufficient support?\nIn large companies, dedicated specialists (30%) and platform engineering teams (28%) are becoming important players in measuring and improving DevEx and DP, according to tech leads. In smaller companies, these roles are less common, with only 16% and 17% of tech leads respectively naming them as responsible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nOur research shows that while developer experience and productivity are in the focus for many companies, some of them still face challenges in measuring, understanding, and improving them.\nTransparency and clarity in DevEx and DP assessment matters\nDevelopers aren’t against being measured, but they need to understand the “how” and “why” behind the process and get constructive, useful feedback based on it.\nThe right tools make all the difference, but how can you be sure a tool is right for your developers if you don’t ask them?\nPoor and unsuitable tooling creates friction, yet many companies fail to track developer satisfaction with their tools.\nDeveloper experience isn’t just the responsibility of team leads\nWhile team leads currently play an essential role in measuring DevEx and DP, over-relying on them without support from dedicated teams and a broader, structured approach can lead to inconsistent efforts across teams within the company and team lead burnout.\nOur series exploring how market and user research is done at JetBrains continues.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nJunie is an intelligent coding agent developed by JetBrains. It automates the full development loop: reading project files, editing code, running tests, and applying fixes, going far beyond simple code generation.\nSimilar to how developers use tools like ChatGPT to solve coding problems, Junie takes it a step further by automating the entire process.\nAs the agent’s architecture evolved, the team needed a secure, robust way to measure progress. They wanted to build a scalable, reproducible evaluation pipeline that would be able to track changes across hundreds of tasks.\nThat’s where TeamCity came in. Junie’s development team uses TeamCity to orchestrate large-scale evaluations, coordinate Dockerized environments, and track important metrics that guide Junie’s improvements.\nThe challenge\nValidating agent improvements at scale\nAs Junie’s agents became more capable, with new commands and smarter decision-making, every change needed to be tested for real impact. Evaluation had to be systematic, repeatable, and grounded in data.\n“Did it get better or not?’ is a very poor way to evaluate. If I just try three examples from memory and see if it got better, that leads nowhere. That’s not how you achieve stable, consistent improvements. You need a benchmark with a large and diverse enough set of tasks to actually measure anything.”\n\n            \nDanila Savenkov, Team Lead, JetBrains Junie\n                                                        \nThe team identified five core requirements for this process:\nScale: Evaluations had to cover at least 100 tasks per run to minimize statistical noise. Running fewer tasks made it hard to draw meaningful conclusions​.\nParallel execution: Tasks needed to be evaluated in parallel, as running them sequentially would take over 24 hours and delay feedback loops​.\nReproducibility: It had to be possible to trace every evaluation back to the exact version of the agent, datasets, and environment used. Local experiments or inconsistent setups were not acceptable​.\nCost control: Each evaluation involved significant LLM API usage, typically costing USD 100+ per run. Tracking and managing these costs was essential​.\nData preservation: Results, logs, and artifacts needed to be stored reliably for analysis, debugging, and long-term tracking​.\nBenchmarking with SWE-bench\nFor a reliable signal, Junie adopted SWE-bench, a benchmark built from real GitHub issues and PRs. They also used SWE-bench Verified, a curated 500-task subset validated by OpenAI for clarity and feasibility.\nIn parallel, Junie created in-house benchmarks for their internal monorepo (Java/Kotlin), Web stack, and Go codebases, continuously covering more languages and technologies by the benchmarks.\nThe operational challenge\nRunning these large-scale evaluations posed operational challenges:\nSpinning up consistent, isolated environments for each task.\nManaging dependencies and project setups.\nApplying patches generated by agents and running validations automatically.\nCollecting structured logs and metrics for deep analysis.\nManual workflows wouldn’t scale. Junie needed automation that was fast, repeatable, and deeply integrated into their engineering stack.\nTeamCity enabled that orchestration. With it, the Junie team built an evaluation pipeline that is scalable, traceable, and deeply integrated into their development loop.\nThe solution\nTo support reliable, large-scale evaluation of its coding agents, Junie implemented an evaluation pipeline powered by TeamCity, a CI/CD solution developed by JetBrains.\nTeamCity orchestrates the execution of hundreds of tasks in parallel, manages isolated environments for each benchmark case, and coordinates patch validation and result collection.\n“If we tried running this locally, it just wouldn’t be realistic. A single evaluation would take a full day. That’s why we use TeamCity: to do everything in parallel, isolated environments, and to ensure the results are reproducible.”\n\n            \nDanila Savenkov, Team Lead, JetBrains Junie\n                                                        \nThe setup enables the team to trace outcomes to specific agent versions, gather detailed logs for analysis, and run evaluations efficiently, while keeping infrastructure complexity and LLM usage costs under control.\nExecution pipeline design\nAt the heart of the system is a composite build configuration defined using Kotlin DSL, which gives Junie full control over task orchestration. Each top-level evaluation run includes multiple build steps.\nExample of a build chain in TeamCity\n\n\n\nEnvironment setup\nEach coding task is paired with a dedicated environment, typically a pre-built Docker container with the necessary dependencies already installed. This guarantees consistency across runs and eliminates local setup variability​.\nAgent execution\nJunie’s agent is launched against the task. It receives a full prompt, including the issue description, code structure, system commands, and guidelines. It then autonomously works through the problem, issuing actions such as file edits, replacements, and test runs​. \nThe final output is a code patch meant to resolve the issue.\nPatch evaluation\nThe generated patch is passed to the next build step, where TeamCity applies it to the project and runs the validation suite. This mimics the GitHub pull request flow – if the original tests were failing and now pass, the task is marked as successfully completed​.\nMetric logging\nExecution metadata, including logs, command traces, and success/failure flags, is exported to an open-source distributed storage and processing system. Junie uses it to store evaluation artifacts and perform large-scale analysis. \nWith the solution’s support for SQL-like querying and scalable data processing, the team can efficiently aggregate insights across hundreds of tasks and track agent performance over time.\nDevelopers rely on this data to:\nTrack the percentage of solved tasks (their “North Star” metric).\nAnalyze the average cost per task for LLM API usage.\nBreak down agent behavior ( like the most frequent commands or typical failure points).\nCompare performance between agent versions​.\nScalability through automation\nBy using Kotlin DSL and TeamCity’s composable build model, Junie scales evaluations to hundreds of tasks per session – far beyond what could be managed manually. For larger datasets (typically 300-2000 tasks), each execution is spun up in parallel, minimizing runtime and allowing the team to test changes frequently.\n“We use Kotlin DSL to configure everything. When you have 13 builds, you can still manage them manually, but when it’s 399, or 500, or 280, it starts getting tricky.”\n\n            \nDanila Savenkov, Team Lead, JetBrains Junie\n                                                        \nResults: reproducible, scalable, insight-driven agent development\nTeamCity has enabled Junie to measure agent performance efficiently and at scale, making their development process faster, more reliable, and data-driven.\nKey outcomes\n\nChallengeResult with TeamCity\nValidate agent changes at scale100+ tasks per run, reducing statistical noise\nLong evaluation cycles (24+ hrs)Tasks run in parallel – now completed in a manageable window\nInconsistent local testingEvery run is reproducible and traceable to the exact agent and dataset\nExpensive LLM usagePer-task usage is tracked, helping optimize development and costs\nFragile logging and data lossLogs and outcomes are automatically stored for later debugging and review\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to scale your AI workflows?\nTeamCity gives you the infrastructure to evaluate and iterate with confidence.

NES leverages the previous edits made and predicts the next edit to come, whether it’s an insertion, deletion, or mix of both. Unlike Copilot completions which are limited to generating suggestions at your caret location, NES can support you anywhere in your file, where the next edit is most likely to occur.\nExample usage scenarios\nNext edit suggestions can be helpful in a variety of scenarios, not only making obvious repetitive changes like renaming, but also more logical changes when you are adding/removing variables or changing the intention of a method. Here are some examples:\n1. Refactoring a 2D Point class to 3D Point:\ndocument.createElement('video');\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Point3-26-1.mp4\n\n2. Update the code syntax to modern C++ using STL:\nNote that NES is not just making repetitive changes to updating all “printf() “ to “std::cout“, but also updating other syntax such as “fgets()“.\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/Migration3-28-1.mp4\n\n3. Make logical changes in response to a newly added variable:\nNES responds quickly to the new variable, which adds the maximum number of guesses a player can make in a game, and Copilot Completions also jumps in to help.\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/AddingVariable3-28.mp4\n\n\nGetting started with next edit suggestions\nEnable NES via Tools > Options > GitHub > Copilot > Copilot Completions > Enable Next Edit Suggestions.\nLike completions, all you need to do to get NES is to start coding!\nWhen there is an available edit suggestion, it could be presented in a diff view where the red diff indicates the original code you had, and the green indicates the new one suggested by Copilot to clearly shows any replacement or deletion of your original code.\nIf the edit is on a different line than the one you are on now, it will suggest you Tab to Navigate to the corresponding line first. The arrow in the hint bar indicates where the next edit is located. You won’t need to manually search for related edits anymore; NES will lead the way!\n\nAfter you are on the same line as the edit, you can Tab to Accept the suggestion.\n\nIn addition to the hint bars, an arrow in the gutter also pops up to indicate that there is an edit suggestion available. You can click on the arrow to explore the edit suggestion menu. This menu allows you to interact with NES using a mouse, when you don’t want to press the Tab key.\n\nSee next edit suggestions explained step-by-step:\n\nPlease give NES a try today to let it assist you in your logical editing flow!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 2022 version 17.14 comes with quality-of-life improvements to its C++ Build Insights integration that will make it easier for you to navigate large multi-project traces and handle long file names for your build inputs and artifacts.\n\nWhat is C++ Build Insights?\nC++ Build Insights is a powerful tool that lets you visualize and optimize the build process of your C++ projects. It leverage MSVC’s trace capture technology and uses the Windows ETW framework to collect detailed information about every build event, such as compilation, linking, code analysis, and more. You can then view and analyze this data in many ways, such as a timeline, a flame graph, or a tree map. As of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.7, C++ Build Insights is integrated into Visual Studio.\nC++ Build Insights can help you identify and fix bottlenecks, dependencies, and inefficiencies in your build system, resulting in faster and more reliable builds. You can also compare different builds and see how your changes affect the build performance over time. To learn more, read how Activision used Build Insights to cut Call of Duty’s Build Time by 50% on the Microsoft Game Dev Blog.\nHow to Filter C++ Build Insights by Project\nOne of the new features in Visual Studio 2022 is the ability to filter your C++ Build Insights results for Visual Studio solutions by project. This can be particularly useful if you have a large solution with multiple projects and you want to focus on one of them. To do this, simply run Build Insights on your solution by selecting Build > Run Build Insights on Solution and then either Build or Rebuild, depending on whether you want to measure the build from scratch. This will generate an ETL (event trace log) trace, which Visual Studio will automatically open to visualize the data collected. Select the project that you want to filter by selecting the funnel next to the Project column and narrowing down the set of projects for which you want to view the data.\nHow to Filter C++ Build Insights by File Paths\nIn addition to project filtering, Build Insights now also supports file path filtering, which gives you fine-grained control over which files are included in your analysis. This is especially helpful in large codebases where build data from third-party libraries or generated code can clutter your view. With the File Path Filter, you can use glob patterns to focus on specific directories or file types—helping you isolate and investigate the build performance of just the parts you care about. Whether you’re narrowing your focus during a regression investigation or simply trying to understand the build cost of a particular code change, file path filtering helps you get answers faster.\nTo do this, simply run Build Insights on your solution by selecting Build > Run Build Insights on Solution and then either Build or Rebuild, depending on whether you want to measure the build from scratch. This will generate an ETL (event trace log) trace, which Visual Studio will automatically open to visualize the data collected. Select the project that you want to filter by selecting the funnel next to the File Path column and typing in the glob pattern you want to focus on or ignore.\nHow to see the file names and paths of build inputs and artifacts\nAnother improvement in Visual Studio is the way Build Insights displays the file names and paths of your build inputs and artifacts, such as source files, object files, libraries, and executables. Instead of showing the full path, which can be quite long and hard to read, Build Insights now shows the relative path and the file name, separated by a backslash. This makes it easier to find your build artifacts, especially if you have a complex folder structure.\nYou can see the file names and paths of your build inputs and artifacts in any view that shows them, such as the Included Files view, which shows the files that are included by each source file during compilation. You can also hover over any build event to see more details, including the file name and path.\nWe hope you find these quality-of-life improvements useful and that they help you optimize your C++ build process. We are always working on making Visual Studio better for developers, and we appreciate your continuous feedback and suggestions. Please tell us what you think of these features and what else you want in Build Insights.\nThe post How to filter C++ Build Insights by project appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

Hugging Face Transformers, Ollama, JAX, Keras, PyTorch, Google AI Edge, UnSloth, vLLM, Gemma.cpp 등 다양한 개발 도구 및 프레임워크와 호환되어 개발자들이 자신이 익숙한 환경에서 Gemma 3를 쉽게 활용하고 실험할 수 있다.\n이 모델은 다양한 벤치마크 테스트에서 동급 모델 대비 최첨단 성능을 입증했다. 특히, Chatbot Arena Elo Score에서 1338점을 기록하며, 여러 오픈 소스 및 상용 모델보다 높은 성능을 보였다. \nGemma 3는 오픈 모델로, 개방형 가중치를 제공하여 사용자가 자유롭게 조정하고 배포할 수 있다. Kaggle과 Hugging Face에서 다운로드 가능하며, Creative Commons 및 Apache 2.0 라이선스를 따름으로써, 개발자와 연구자에게 VLM 기술에 대한 접근성을 높여준다.\n\n개발 환경\n개발 환경은 다음과 같다. 미리 설치, 가입한다.\n\nollama:  https://ollama.com/download/windows\ngemma3: https://ollama.com/search\nserper 서비스: 가입. https://serper.dev/dashboard \n\n설치되어 있다면, 다음 명령을 터미널에서 실행한다.\nollama pull gemma3:4b\n\n\n\ngemma3:4b GPU VRAM 소모량\n\n\n이제 다음과 같이 모델을 실행해 볼 수 있다. \n\n\n\n\n참고로, GPU VRAM 등을 고려해 더 성능이 좋은 파라메터수 많은 대형 모델을 사용할 수도 있다.\n\n\ngemma3 지원 모델들\n\n처리 프로세스\n이 실습 프로그램의 프로세스는 다음과 같다.\n\n\nGradio 앱이 시작되면, 사용자의 입력이 발생하고 이 입력은 process_message 함수에 전달된다. 이 함수는 사용자의 메시지를 chat_history에 추가하여 대화 기록을 저장한다. 이후 모델에게 전달할 대화 문맥을 구성하기 위해 messages 리스트가 생성된다.\n\n\n그 다음 단계에서는 ollama.chat 함수를 통해 언어 모델에게 응답을 요청하게 되며, 이 응답 내에 함수 호출이 포함되어 있는지를 확인한다. 만약 응답에 함수 호출이 포함되어 있다면, 이를 parse_function_call 함수를 통해 파싱한다.\n\n\n파싱된 함수가 google_search라면, 모델이 검색을 원한다고 판단하여 검색 쿼리를 추출하고 검색 수행 예정임을 사용자에게 안내하는 메시지를 추가한다. 이후 실제로 google_search 함수를 실행하여 외부 검색을 수행한다.\n\n\n검색 결과는 다시 chat_history에 저장되며, 이 결과를 바탕으로 언어 모델에게 재질문을 하여 더 정확하고 완성된 응답을 유도한다. 모델이 생성한 최종 응답은 chat_history에 마지막으로 추가되고, 이 전체 대화 기록이 사용자에게 반환된다.\n\n\n이 구조는 사용자의 질의에 따라 외부 정보까지 능동적으로 검색하고 반영할 수 있는 LLM 기반 AI 에이전트의 대표적인 흐름을 보여준다.\n\n\n다음은 이 순서도를 보여준다.\n\n\n\n구현하기\n터미널에서 다음 라이브러리를 설치한다.\npip install langchain-core langchain-openai gradio ollama requests python-dotenv pydantic\n\n\n새로운 파이썬 파일(코드 참고)을 생성한 후, 우선, 필요한 라이브러리를 임포트한다. \n\nimport gradio as gr\nimport ollama\nimport requests, json, os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Optional, Dict, Any, List\n\nload_dotenv()\nSERPER_API_KEY = os.getenv('SERPER_API_KEY')\n\n\n\n그리고, 사용하는 API 키를 가져온다. 이를 위해, 미리 .env 파일을 다음과 같이 만들어 놓고, 해당 API를 입력해 놓야야 한다.\n\n# .env\nSERPER_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>\n\n\n\n파라메터에서 검색 질의문, 함수호출명과 파라메터를 정의한다. 아울러, 질의 결과를 명확히 데이터항목으로 추출하기 위해서 검색 결과가 될 데이타항목(타이틀, 링크, 스닙펫) 형식을 pydantic의 basemodel을 이용해 명확히 정의한다. 그리고, LLM 호출 결과를 펑션콜이 가능한 형식으로 변환하기 위한 파싱 함수인 parse_function_call 을 정의한다.\n\nclass SearchParameters(BaseModel):\n    query: str = Field(..., description=\"Search term to look up\")\n\nclass FunctionCall(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    parameters: Dict[str, Any]\n\nclass SearchResult(BaseModel):\n    title: str\n    link: str\n    snippet: str\n\n    def to_string(self) -> str:\n        return f\"Title: {self.title}\\nLink: {self.link}\\nSnippet: {self.snippet}\"\n\ndef google_search(query: str) -> SearchResult:\n    \"\"\"Perform a Google search using Serper.dev API\"\"\"\n    try:\n        url = \"https://google.serper.dev/search\"\n        payload = json.dumps({\"q\": query})\n        headers = {\n            'X-API-KEY': SERPER_API_KEY,\n            'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n        }\n        \n        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload)\n        response.raise_for_status()  # 잘못된 상태 코드에 대해 예외 발생\n        \n        results = response.json()\n        \n        if not results.get('organic'):\n            raise ValueError(\"No search results found.\")\n            \n        first_result = results['organic'][0]\n        return SearchResult(\n            title=first_result.get('title', 'No title'),\n            link=first_result.get('link', 'No link'),\n            snippet=first_result.get('snippet', 'No snippet available.')\n        )\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Search error: {str(e)}\")\n        raise\n\ndef parse_function_call(response: str) -> Optional[FunctionCall]:\n    \"\"\"Parse the model's response to extract function calls\"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Clean the response and find JSON structure\n        response = response.strip()\n        start_idx = response.find('{')\n        end_idx = response.rfind('}') + 1\n        \n        if start_idx == -1 or end_idx == 0:\n            return None\n            \n        json_str = response[start_idx:end_idx]\n        data = json.loads(json_str)\n        return FunctionCall(**data)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error parsing function call: {str(e)}\")\n        return None\n\n\n\ngemma에 지시할 시스템 프롬프트 명령을 정의한다. prompt_system_message는 이 챗봇이 어떻게 동작해야 하는지, 그리고 어떤 기준으로 답변을 해야 하는지에 대한 지침을 제공하는 역할을 한다. 이 메시지는 챗봇이 2024년까지의 정보를 학습한 AI 어시스턴트임을 명확히 하고, 사용자의 질문에 대해 가능한 경우에는 바로 답변을 하되, 최신 정보나 불확실한 내용, 시의성이 있는 질문에 대해서는 반드시 펑션콜을 통해 검색 기능을 활용해야 함을 명시한다. 이전 대화 내용이 함께 입력으로 주어지기 때문에, 챗봇은 이 대화 맥락을 참고하여 일관성 있고 상황에 맞는 답변을 해야 한다고 안내한다. 참고로, 준수해야 할 gemma3의 function call 형식은 다음과 같다. \n\ngemini-samples/examples/gemma-function-calling.ipynb at main · philschmid/gemini-samples\n\n검색이 필요한 상황과 그렇지 않은 상황을 구체적으로 구분하여, 챗봇이 임의로 정보를 추정하거나 추가하지 않고, 검색 결과에 기반한 사실만을 간결하게 전달하도록 유도한다. 검색이 필요한 경우에는 정해진 JSON 형식으로만 응답하도록 하여, 시스템이 함수 호출 방식으로 검색을 처리할 수 있게 한다.\n\n# 프롬프트 시스템 메세지 정의\nprompt_system_message = \"\"\"You are an AI assistant with training data up to 2024.

        "contentSnippet": "스마트폰 속 음식 사진, 블로그 수익으로 바꾸는 비법! 용량 부족 걱정 없이 애드센스 수익까지 얻는 맛집 블로그, AI가 알아서 만들어줘요!\n\n\n \n 스마트폰에 쌓여만 가는 수많은 음식 사진들, 용량 부족 경고가 뜨면 결국 아깝지만 지워야 하죠?   그런데 이 사진들을 전문적인 맛집 블로그로 올리고, 여기에 애드센스 수익까지 얻는다면 금상첨화 아닐까요? 지금 보고 계신 이 블로그 포스팅처럼 말이죠!\n놀라지 마세요. 이 모든 걸 이번에도 제미나이로 가능합니다! 제가 지난번에 제미나이를 활용한 초고속 블로그 글쓰기 영상을 올렸는데요, 정말 많은 분들이 \"실제로 그 지침을 어떻게 만드는지\" 알고 싶다고 하셔서 이번에는 그 비하인드를 공개하는 심화 강의를 준비했습니다.  \n \n우리가 AI와 효과적으로 대화하기 위해서는 그저 \"맛집 글 써줘\"라고 하는 것보다 훨씬 더 체계적인 접근이 필요해요. 정확한 지시와 명확한 가이드라인이 있어야 원하는 결과를 얻을 수 있죠. 그래서 오늘은 이 특별한 '젬 지침'을 만드는 과정까지 여러분께 낱낱이 공개하려고 합니다! 그리고 이번 지침의 핵심에는 단순 글쓰기가 아닌 제미나이의 멀티모달 기능이 있습니다. 이 기능이 왜 혁명적인지, 어떻게 하면 이를 최대한 활용할 수 있는지 함께 알아보겠습니다.\n \nAI 멀티모달 기능의 이해와 활용  \n여러분, 예전 AI는 텍스트만 읽을 수 있었어요. 하지만 최근에는 많은 LLM 모델들이 사진도 보고, 영상도 이해하는 '멀티모달' 능력을 갖추게 되었습니다. 마치 우리가 식당에서 메뉴를 선택할 때 사진과 설명을 함께 보는 것처럼요! 멀티모달이란 쉽게 말해서 다양한 형태의 정보를 동시에 이해하고 처리할 수 있는 인공지능 기술을 의미하는데요. 예를 들어 맛집 사진을 AI에게 보여주면, 예전의 AI는 \"이것은 사진입니다\"라고만 인식했지만, 멀티모달 기능이 있으면 \"이 사진은 식당 내부이고, 테이블 위에는 해물칼국수가 있으며, 옆에는 김치가 놓여있고, 사람들이 즐겁게 식사하고 있네요\"라고 더 자세하고 종합적으로 이해할 수 있게 된 거죠.\n \n여기서 재미있는 점은 AI가 이제 '맥락'을 읽을 수 있다는 거예요. 식당 내부 사진, 음식 사진, 메뉴판을 보고 \"아, 이건 맛집 리뷰를 위한 사진들이구나\"라고 파악합니다. 그래서 여러분이 찍은 맛집 사진을 몇 장만 넣어줘도 전문 블로거가 쓴 것 같은 리뷰를 뚝딱 만들어내는 것이 가능해진 겁니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI가 아무리 똑똑해도 여러분의 머릿속 생각을 알아서 척척 맞춰주진 않아요. 구체적인 지시가 없으면, 기대한 결과가 나오기 어렵습니다.\n \n프롬프트 엔지니어링의 중요성 (기본적인 시도와 한계)  \n자, 이제 기본적인 방법으로 한번 시도해보겠습니다. 제가 천안에 사는데, 최근에 방문한 회사 근처 \"성거산 시골 막국수\"라는 곳의 사진 일곱 장을 준비했습니다. 이 사진들을 제미나이에 업로드하고 간단하게 \"이 사진들로 맛집 블로그 포스팅을 작성해줘\"라고 요청해보겠습니다. 천안 오시면 꼭 한 번 방문해 보세요. 맛있어요!!\n음... 나쁘지 않지만 뭔가 아쉬워요. '성거산 막국수: 막국수와 찰떡궁합 보쌈 맛집!'이라는 제목으로 기본적인 정보는 잘 담았지만, 뭔가 차별화된 느낌이 부족합니다. '식당은 넓은 주차 공간을 갖추고 있어, 차량으로 방문하기에 정말 편리했어요' '내부로 들어서니 생각보다 훨씬 넓고 쾌적한 공간이 펼쳐졌습니다'처럼 정보는 있지만 독자의 감성을 자극하는 생생한 묘사가 부족하죠.\n구분\n설명\n기대 효과\n\n\n\n\n명확한 역할 부여\n\"너는 지금부터 맛집 블로거야!\"\n글의 톤앤매너와 방향 설정\n\n\n구체적인 목표 제시\n\"사진 분석해서 생생한 맛집 리뷰 써줘.\"\nAI가 나아가야 할 명확한 길 제시\n\n\n결과 형식 지정\n\"HTML 코드로, 특정 스타일 적용해서.\"\n일관성 있고 사용 가능한 결과물 도출\n\n\n\n이럴 때 프롬프트 엔지니어링이 효과적인 것이죠. 프롬프트 엔지니어링은 AI에게 어떤 요청을 할 때, 원하는 결과물을 얻기 위해 질문이나 요청을 효과적으로 설계하는 기술입니다. 간단히 말해 AI와 잘 소통하는 방법을 찾는 거죠. 프롬프트 엔지니어링의 핵심은 AI에게 명확한 역할, 목표, 형식을 제공하는 것입니다. 이 프롬프트 엔지니어링을 기반으로 젬 지침을 만드는 것이죠.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nAI가 아무리 똑똑해도 여러분의 머릿속 생각을 알아서 척척 맞춰주지 않습니다. 구체적인 지시가 없으면, 기대한 결과가 나오기 어렵다는 점을 꼭 기억하세요!\n \nGoogle AI Studio 활용 (젬 지침 제작 환경)  \n오늘 저는 이 젬 지침을 제미나이 2.5 모델을 이용해 만들려고 합니다. 하지만 제미나이 사이트가 아닌 AI Studio라는 곳에서 지침을 만들게요.\n  AI Studio는?\nGoogle AI Studio는 구글에서 제공하는 개발자 친화적인 플랫폼으로, AI 모델을 더 세밀하게 제어하고 실험할 수 있는 공간입니다. 개발자, 학생, 연구자들이 프롬프트를 테스트하고 최적화하며, API 통합까지 준비할 수 있는 전문적인 환경이죠. AI Studio도 무료로 사용할 수 있습니다.\n특히 구글의 다양한 최신 AI 모델들을 가장 빨리 만날 수 있으니, 영상 설명란의 링크로 접속하셔서, 다양한 경험을 해 보세요. 흥미로운 사실은, 제가 이번에는 파라미터 조정 없이 기본값으로 진행했는데도 일반 제미나이와 결과가 달랐다는 점입니다. 왜 그럴까요?\nAI Studio vs. 일반 제미나이 차이점\n1) 첫 번째 단계: AI Studio는 기본 Temperature(창의성) 값이 1.0으로 설정되어 있어 더 다양하고 창의적인 결과물 생성\n2) 두 번째 단계: 일반 제미나이는 일관된 답변을 위해 이 값을 더 낮게 설정 가능\n→ AI Studio는 모델의 '날 것 그대로'의 동작을 확인하고 제어하는 데 중점을 둡니다. 따라서, 전문적인 콘텐츠 제작이나 복잡한 지침을 만들 때는 AI Studio에서 작업하는 것을 추천합니다.\n \n맛집 블로그 프롬프트 제작 과정 (1차 및 2차 수정)  ‍ ‍ \n자, 이제 본격적으로 맛집 블로그용 지침을 만들어 보겠습니다! AI STUDIO에 방문하신 후 우측에서 최신 AI 모델을 선택합니다. 아까 얘기한 것처럼 하단에 파라메터는 그대로 두고 첫 번째 프롬프트를 입력할게요. \"사용자 입력 정보와 사진을 기반으로 멀티모달 기능을 최대한 활용하여 구글 상위노출에 최적화된 맛집탐방 블로그 기사를 생성하고 그 결과물을 HTML 코드로 생성하는 젬 지침을 만들어\" 라고 요청하면 바로 맛집 블로거를 위한 지침을 생성합니다.\n  알아두세요!\n1차 요청에서는 사용자에게 너무 많은 정보를 요구했습니다. 식당명, 주소, 키워드, 한 줄 평 등. 편리하게 쓰려고 AI를 활용하는데, 정보 입력에 시간을 다 쓰면 본말이 전도됩니다.\n그래서 두 번째 요청에서는 복잡한 질문만 단순화했습니다. \"사용자에게 묻는 질문이 너무 많아. 처음에 식당명/지역, 주문음식/추가음식, 주변음식/반찬, 후식, 방문배경, 사진을 요청하면서 시작하고, 사용자가 입력을 하면 나머지 정보는 사진을 분석해서 대신 작성하게 지침을 수정해\" 이런 식으로 사용자가 5가지 질문과 사진 업로드만으로 맛집 블로그를 작성할 수 있도록 만들었어요. 중요한 점은, 제미나이의 멀티모달 기능을 활용해 사진을 직접 분석하여 블로그 내용에 반영하도록 한 것이죠.\n \n젬 지침 등록 및 테스트  \n자, 이렇게 해서 나온 2차 결과물을, 제미나이로 돌아가서 젬 지침에 등록을 하고, 결과를 확인해볼게요. 젬 관리자의 샘 젬 만들기에서 예를 들어 제목을 \"맛집 블로그 전문가\"라고 입력을 합니다.\n사례 주인공의 상황: '성거산 시골 막국수' 테스트\n1. 식당명/지역: 천안 성거, 성거산 시골 막국수\n2. 주문음식/추가음식: 비빔 막국수와 수육\n계산 과정: 간편한 입력으로 결과 확인\n1) 3. 주변 음식/반찬: 주변 음식 코너가 따로 있고 셀프임\n2) 4. 후식: 후식 없음\n최종 결과: 블로그 글 자동 생성!\n- 5. 방문배경: 5월 중순 26도의 이른 더위 점심시간. 팀원들과 점심 식사\n- 사진 업로드 → AI가 알아서 블로그 글 생성\n이런 식으로 결과를 확인하고 수정할 부분을 계속해서 AI와 대화를 해 나가면서 완성형으로 만들어 가는 것입니다. 완벽한 결과물은 처음부터 나오지 않습니다. AI와 지속적인 대화를 통해 결과를 확인하고 수정해나가는 '반복 최적화' 과정이 핵심입니다. 제가 이전 영상에서 공유해드린 지침들도 수십 번의 시행착오와 세밀한 조정을 거쳐 완성된 것들이랍니다.\n \n결과물 개선 (HTML 구조 및 디자인 문제점 해결)  \n자, 지금 우리가 받은 결과물을 살펴보면 세 가지 중요한 문제점이 보입니다. 이런 세부 사항들이 블로그 포스팅의 품질을 좌우하게 됩니다.\nHTML 코드 생성 문제: HTML 코드가 코드 블록 안에 제대로 생성되지 않았습니다.\n불완전한 HTML 구조: HTML이 완전한 형태의 웹페이지 구조(HTML, HEAD, BODY 태그 포함)로 표시되고 있습니다. 이는 블로그에 붙여넣을 때 구조적 충돌을 일으킵니다. 블로그 플랫폼은 이미 이 태그들을 가지고 있기 때문이죠.\nH1 태그 중복 문제: 블로그 플랫폼에서는 제목을 별도로 입력하는 필드가 있기 때문에, 본문 내에 H1 태그가 있으면 중복 제목이 생겨 SEO에 좋지 않고 디자인도 깨질 수 있습니다.\n이런 경우, AI에게 '블로그 본문에 추가해야 하므로 헤드, 바디 태그와 에이치원 태그가 없는 인라인 스타일로 변경해주세요. 제목은 별도로 입력할 것입니다.'라고 요청하세요. 그러면 블로그 플랫폼에 바로 붙여넣을 수 있는 최적화된 HTML 코드를 받을 수 있습니다. 위의 2가지 문제 개선을 위해, 1. 이 지침의 출력물 중 HTML 코드로 생성되는 결과물은 \"코드 블록\"으로 출력해, 2. 블로그 본문에 추가해야 하므로 헤드, 바디 태그와 에이치원 태그가 없는 인라인 스타일로 변경해. 라고 다시 지침 수정을 요청합니다.\n \n자, 수정된 지침으로 생성된 결과물을 보면 인라인 스타일의 에이치티엠엘 코드가 코드블록에서 생성되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 그런데 이번엔 디자인이 별로입니다. 이럴 때는 \"좀 더 시각화된 결과물이 나올 수 있게 디자인을 개선해줘\" 또는 구체적인 디자인 지침을 주거나 이전 영상에서 소개한 디자인 템플릿을 업로드하고 \"첨부 디자인 스타일로 반영되게 수정해\"라고 요청하셔도 될 거 같습니다. 아, 그리고 디자인만 보시려면, 젬을 수정할 필요 없이, AI STUDIO의 수정된 지침의 코드만 복사해서 코드펜으로 가서 확인하면 됩니다.\n \n \n맛집 블로그 생성 지침 핵심 요약!\n✨ 프롬프트 엔지니어링: AI와 잘 소통하는 기술. 명확한 역할, 목표, 형식을 제공하여 원하는 결과물을 얻는 것이 핵심이죠.\n  멀티모달 기능 활용: 사진을 직접 분석해서 생생한 리뷰를 작성하도록 지시! 단순히 텍스트를 생성하는 것을 넘어, 시각 정보까지 통합하여 블로그 글의 퀄리티를 높입니다.\n  HTML 구조 및 디자인 최적화:\nHTML = (SEO 최적화) + (인라인 스타일) + (H1 태그 제외)\n ‍  반복 최적화의 중요성: 완벽한 결과물은 한 번에 나오지 않아요! AI와 지속적으로 대화하고, 결과를 수정하며 더 나은 지침을 만들어가는 과정이 필요합니다.\n이 지침으로 여러분도 전문 맛집 블로거로 거듭나세요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 제미나이 멀티모달 기능은 어떤 점에서 혁신적인가요?\nA:   예전 AI는 텍스트만 이해했지만, 멀티모달 기능은 사진, 영상 등 다양한 형태의 정보를 동시에 이해하고 처리할 수 있어, AI가 맥락을 파악하고 더 풍부하고 정확한 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있게 합니다.\nQ: AI Studio를 사용하는 이유가 무엇인가요?\nA:   AI Studio는 구글의 최신 AI 모델을 가장 먼저 접하고, Temperature(창의성) 값 등을 세밀하게 조정하며 프롬프트를 테스트하고 최적화할 수 있는 개발자 친화적인 환경을 제공합니다.\nQ: 블로그 포스팅용 HTML 코드를 생성할 때 주의할 점은?\nA:   블로그 플랫폼의 구조와 충돌하지 않도록 HEAD, BODY 태그와 H1 태그를 제외한 인라인 스타일로 코드를 생성해야 합니다.\nQ: 맛집 블로그를 위한 '젬 지침'은 어떻게 만드나요?\nA:   AI Studio에서 프롬프트 엔지니어링을 활용하여 AI에게 명확한 역할, 목표, 형식을 부여하고, 사용자가 최소한의 정보만 입력해도 되는 방식으로 반복 최적화 과정을 거쳐 만듭니다.\nQ: 완성된 블로그 콘텐츠를 어떻게 활용할 수 있나요?\nA:   생성된 고품질의 블로그 포스팅을 꾸준히 업로드하여 블로그 방문자를 늘리고, 애드센스 수익을 창출하며, 스마트폰 용량 확보와 맛집 기록까지 일석삼조의 효과를 누릴 수 있습니다.\nGEM 무료 지침 다운 로드\n반응형\n\n    \n    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});\n  \n\n    \n\n    \n맛집 블로그 생성 GEM 지침.zip\n0.01MB",

NBA가 요즘 이렇게 주목받는 건 이제 농구 리그를 넘어, 전 세계를 무대로 하는 콘텐츠 플랫폼으로 자리 잡았기 때문이에요.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 포스트시즌: 정규 시즌이 끝난 뒤 열리는 모든 경기\nNBA에서 최근 눈에 띄는 건 미국 국적이 아닌 선수들의 활약이 눈부시다는 점입니다. 2018-19 시즌부터 올 시즌까지 7시즌 연속으로 유럽, 아프리카, 캐나다 출신 선수들이 정규리그 MVP를 차지했거든요. 이런 모습은 NBA가 글로벌 콘텐츠로 성장하고 있다는 걸 잘 보여줍니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\n20-21, 21-22, 23-24 시즌 MVP를 차지한 세르비아 출신 니콜라 요키치 / 사진: 로이터\n산업적으로도 NBA는 발 빠르게 시대를 읽고 있어요. 한때는 전통적인 방식에 얽매인 리그라는 평가를 받았지만, 이제는 OTT와 소셜 미디어를 가장 잘 활용하는 스포츠 리그로 평가받고 있죠. 어떻게 NBA는 이런 변화를 이끌어냈을까요?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}실리콘밸리와 월스트리트 출신\n구단주들이 만든 변화\nNBA는 2010년대 이후 완전히 새로운 시대를 맞았어요. 과거에는 지역 기업가들이 농구팀의 구단주가 된다는 건 연고지의 명예를 드러내는 상징으로 여겨졌어요. 그런데 .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}최근에는 실리콘밸리와 월스트리트 출신의 기술·금융 전문가들이 구단을 사들이고 있어요. LA 클리퍼스의 구단주 스티브 발머처럼 기술과 데이터, 그리고 콘텐츠 비즈니스에 강점을 가진 이들이 NBA를 이끌고 있죠.\n\n실리콘밸리나 월스트리트 출신 구단주들이 NBA에 집중적으로 나타난 이유는 이들이 젊은 시절 마이클 조던을 중심으로 한 NBA 황금시대를 경험했기 때문입니다. 기본적으로, 농구에 대한 애정이 깊은 것이죠.\n물론 그렇다고 단순히 농구만 좋아해서 NBA팀의 구단주가 된 것은 아닙니다. MLB나 NFL은 경기에 뛰는 선수의 수가 많아서 승리를 위한 변수가 상대적으로 NBA보다 더 많습니다. 하지만 농구는 5명이 뛰기 때문에 한두 명의 스타급 선수들이 가지는 영향력이 매우 크죠. 기술·금융 전문가들에게 NBA는 데이터를 활용한 경기 전략과 적절한 선수 트레이드를 통한 빠른 전력 극대화에 안성맞춤이었던 리그였던 셈입니다.\n그리고 농구는 축구 다음으로 글로벌 확장성이 큰 스포츠라는 점도 중요했어요. 야구나 미식축구처럼 특정 지역에서만 사랑받는 종목과는 달리, 북미, 유럽, 아시아 어디서나 큰 관심을 받으니까요. 이런 점에서 NBA는 글로벌 시장을 중시하는 실리콘밸리와 월스트리트 사람들에게 매력적인 투자처였어요.\n\n구단주의 배경이 바뀌면서 NBA의 매출 변화도 확실히 드러나요. 2009-10 시즌에 5조 2,500억 원이었던 매출이 최근 시즌에는 15조 6,000억 원을 넘었습니다. 데이터 기반의 전략과 빠른 실험으로 이런 성장을 만들어냈죠. 유니폼 광고, 트레이드 활성화, 3점슛 중심 전술 혁신 같은 것들이 대표적이에요.\nNBA의 혁신에는 유대계 구단주들의 역할도 눈에 띕니다. 실제로 최근 10년 동안 무려 8번이나 유대인 구단주가 투자한 팀이 우승을 차지했을 정도입니다. 여기에 현 NBA 총재인 아담 실버도 유대인입니다. 그래서 유대인이 NBA의 혁신을 주도했다는 얘기가 나오고 있죠.\n유대인들은 전통적으로 교육과 상업, 금융 분야에서 강한 경쟁력을 키워왔어요. 미국 전체 인구의 2.4%에 불과하지만, 미국 억만장자의 40%가 유대계라는 통계가 있을 정도로 경제적 영향력이 큽니다. 데이터를 중시하고 네트워크를 활용하는 이들의 경영 방식은 NBA를 단순한 ‘경기장을 보유한 스포츠팀’이 아니라 글로벌 IP와 데이터, 콘텐츠 비즈니스로 확장할 수 있는 플랫폼으로 이끌었습니다.\n\n혁신을 이끌고 있는 NBA 총재 아담 실버 / 사진: 로이터\n팬들이 원한다면\n규칙도 바꾸는 유연함\nNBA는 팬들이 더 재미있게 경기를 볼 수 있다면 규칙도 기꺼이 바꿔왔어요. 경기가 즐거워야 팬이 늘고, 팬이 많아진다면 수익은 덩달아 따라오기 때문이죠.\n그래서 핸드체킹 금지(2004-05 시즌)로 외곽 공격수를 자유롭게 풀어주고, 수비 3초 규칙(2001-02 시즌)으로 골밑 수비를 약화해 코트를 넓혔습니다. 공격 리바운드 후 샷 클락은 14초로 단축(2018-19 시즌)해 경기 속도를 높였고, 3점슛 시도가 폭발적으로 늘었습니다. 그 결과, 2010년대 초반만 해도 팀당 경기당 3점슛 시도는 18회 수준이었지만 지금은 37회를 넘었어요.\n\nNBA 3점슛 전술의 아이콘, 스테판 커리 / 사진: 로이터\n2021년에는 7~10위 팀들이 플레이오프*를 놓고 토너먼트를 벌이는 ‘플레이 인 토너먼트’도 생겼어요. 정규 시즌 마지막까지 긴장감을 유지할 수 있도록 한 거죠. 2023-24 시즌부터는 정규 시즌 중간에 ‘인시즌 토너먼트’까지 열어 유럽 축구처럼 또 다른 트로피 경쟁을 만들었어요. NBA는 경기 규칙을 단순한 룰이 아니라, 팬들이 더 몰입할 수 있도록 하는 콘텐츠 설계의 일부로 보고 있어요.\n* 플레이오프: 포스트 시즌 중, 정규 시즌 상위 팀들이 우승을 놓고 겨루는 토너먼트 경기\n넷플릭스, 디즈니 버금가는\n콘텐츠 왕국을 꿈꾸는 NBA\nNBA는 경기 중계뿐만 아니라 경기장 안팎에서 일어나는 모든 순간을 콘텐츠로 만듭니다. 감독의 작전회의, 벤치에서의 리액션, 선수들끼리의 대화까지도 NBA 리그패스*에서 그대로 볼 수 있죠. ESPN과 TNT 같은 중계 파트너사도 이런 영상들을 공유받아서 프리·포스트쇼나 SNS 숏폼 영상으로 가공해 더 많은 팬을 붙잡고 있어요.\n* NBA 리그패스: NBA에서 직접 운영하는 OTT 서비스\n라커룸 비하인드 영상, 팬 인터뷰, 팀별 다큐멘터리 시리즈까지도 만들어내요. 마이클 조던이 시카고 불스에서 활약하던 이야기를 다룬 넷플릭스 다큐멘터리 <The Last Dance>처럼 농구 경기 너머의 이야기를 ‘팔리는 IP’로 키워가는 거죠. 요즘 팬들은 단순히 누가 이겼는지만이 아니라, 누가 어떤 말을 했고 어떤 표정을 지었는지까지도 궁금해합니다. NBA는 이 모든 순간을 이야기로 가공해서 2차 콘텐츠로 풀어냅니다.\n\n선수들의 하이라이트 영상을 NFT 형태로 거래하며 보유할 수 있는 NBA Top Shot\n최근에는 VR과 NFT 같은 새로운 기술도 적극적으로 도입하고 있어요. 리그패스에 VR 중계 기술을 도입해 마치 경기장에 직접 있는 것처럼 몰입감을 높이고, NBA Top Shot 같은 NFT 플랫폼을 통해 명장면을 디지털 소유권으로 만들어 팔고 있죠. 팬들은 이걸 사고팔며, NBA와의 관계를 데이터와 디지털 자산 차원에서 더 깊게 쌓아가고 있어요. 특히 NBA Top Shot의 누적 거래액은 1조 4,000억 원을 돌파할 정도로 규모가 커졌습니다.\n이제 NBA는 단순히 농구 경기만이 아니라, 이야기와 데이터, 디지털 소유권까지 아우르는 거대한 비즈니스로 성장하고 있습니다.\nSNS 영향력\n1위 스포츠 리그, NBA\nNBA는 소셜 미디어에서도 압도적인 영향력을 자랑합니다. 디지털 미디어 분석업체 퀄트릭스가 발표한 자료에 따르면, 4대 소셜 미디어에서 NBA의 팔로워는 2억 600만 명을 넘습니다. 이는 NASA와 넷플릭스보다 많은 수치이며, UFC와 NFL 같은 다른 스포츠 리그들과 비교해도 큰 격차를 보입니다.\n\n이런 영향력은 NBA가 팬들이 자유롭게 콘텐츠를 만들어내도록 허용했기 때문에 가능했습니다. 아담 실버 NBA 총재는 “팬들이 만드는 하이라이트는 스낵이에요. 스낵을 먹으면 결국 정식 식사(정규 중계)를 찾게 됩니다.”라고 말한 바 있죠. 실제로 NBA는 인플루언서나 팬 크리에이터들을 주요 이벤트에 초대해, 그들이 자신만의 방식으로 NBA를 해석하고 전파하게끔 도와주고 있어요.\n다른 프로 스포츠 리그들은 팬들이 올린 경기 영상을 저작권 침해로 규제하는 경우가 많아요. 하지만 NBA는 오히려 팬 콘텐츠를 새로운 성장 동력으로 보고 있죠. 구단들도 소셜미디어 전담팀을 두고 선수들의 훈련 영상이나 개인적인 순간을 SNS에 공유하고 있어요.\n보스턴 셀틱스는 동영상 하이라이트를 제공하면서 선수들의 움직임을 농구 작전 판처럼 볼 수 있는 컨텐츠도 만들고, 경기 후에 스타 선수가 어떻게 컨디션을 회복하는지에 대한 개인적인 영상도 포스팅하며 큰 인기를 누리고 있습니다. 이 덕분에 셀틱스의 인스타그램 팔로워는 이미 700만 명을 넘었습니다. 팬들이 소비하는 콘텐츠를 통해 나오는 광고 수입은 보스턴 셀틱스 구단의 또 다른 비즈니스 모델이 되고 있죠.\nNBA가 오랜 인연을 뒤로 하고\n아마존과 새로 손 잡은 이유\nNBA의 급격한 매출 성장에는 중계권 계약도 중요한 역할을 했습니다. 2002-2003 시즌을 앞두고 NBA는 6시즌 동안 5조 5000억 원에 달하는 중계권료 계약을 체결했었는데, 2016-17 시즌부터 올 시즌까지 9시즌 동안은 33조 원이 넘는 중계권료를 받았습니다. 이를 한 시즌 평균으로 환산하면 3조 6000억 원이 넘는 거액입니다. 다음 시즌부터는 한 시즌에만 9조 5,000억 원이 넘는 중계권 수익을 올릴 전망입니다. 직전 중계권 계약에 비해 금액이 3배 가까이 늘어난 규모죠.\n흥미로운 건, NBA가 35년 동안 중계권을 보유했던 TNT 스포츠 대신 아마존을 새로운 중계 파트너로 선택했다는 사실입니다. TNT 스포츠가 제시한 금액은 아마존과 동일했음에도 불구하고, NBA는 아마존의 손을 들어주었습니다. 왜 NBA는 아마존을 새로운 중계 파트너로 선정했을까요?\n\nNBA는 이제 케이블 TV 중심의 중계가 시대에 뒤처진 방식이라는 점을 잘 알고 있었습니다. 미국 내 케이블 TV 가입 가구는 계속 줄어들고 있으며, OTT가 대세가 되고 있기 때문이죠. 게다가 OTT 서비스는 글로벌 확장력이 뛰어납니다. NBA는 이미 자체 스트리밍 서비스인 리그패스를 운영하고 있지만, 아마존 같은 글로벌 OTT 파트너를 통해 리그의 해외 팬을 더 효과적으로 확보할 수 있다고 판단했습니다.\n무엇보다 가장 중요한 이유는 바로 고객 데이터에 있습니다. 기존 방송사는 단순히 시청자 수만 알려줬지만, 아마존은 “뉴욕에 사는 21세 남성이 스테픈 커리 경기를 23분 시청했고, 나이키 구매율이 평균보다 25% 높다” 같은 데이터를 NBA에 전달할 수 있습니다. NBA는 이런 데이터를 스폰서나 파트너사에 다시 팔아 새로운 수익을 만들어내고 있어요.\n이제 NBA는 단순히 농구 경기만 보여주는 무대가 아닙니다. 경기장에서 펼쳐지는 모든 순간을 이야기로 만들고, 그 이야기를 데이터로 바꿔 새로운 수익을 창출하는 글로벌 콘텐츠 플랫폼이죠. NBA가 만드는 이 흐름은 모든 스포츠 팬과 산업계에 새로운 영감을 주고 있습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 윤자영",
