        "content:encodedSnippet": "vcpkg, an open-source C/C++ package manager maintained by Microsoft, is increasingly recognized as a leading dependency management solution. As an enterprise-grade tool, it enables organizations to streamline library imports, reduce duplication, and support flexible, reproducible builds across a wide array of environments.\nThis need for streamlined dependency management is especially relevant in the build system for the Visual Studio repository. This system not only supports the development of Visual Studio itself but also integrates decades of legacy infrastructure, specialized tools, and complex architecture. The primary goal of integrating vcpkg is to simplify the acquisition and management of open-source native libraries by providing a unified solution that not only replaces manual compilation and custom integration for each project but also ensures security compliance throughout the process.\nTo achieve our objectives, we divided the execution into two distinct phases: an initial phase focused on prototyping and experimentation, followed by a second phase dedicated to productization and integration into the build process.\nPrototype\nThis investigation started by adopting vcpkg from scratch, aiming to make it easier to use existing package libraries in the build environment. We started with a practical experiment: integrating vcpkg into our environment with the SQLite library.\nWe chose SQLite because it’s widely used and handled differently across various build components, making it an excellent test case for streamlining and standardizing library management. This investigation also demonstrates that we can adapt the cereal and libuv libraries for local vcpkg use.\nWhy vcpkg?\nSupports secure, reproducible builds in isolated environments.\nPrivate registry: lets our organization keep an internal catalog of approved libraries and library versions, simplifying compliance, standardization and security screening.\nAsset caching: allows build machines to get source files and tools from internal servers, without the need for public internet access.\nAs part of our previous workflow, our build environment used MSBuild and relied on NuGet packages to manage tools and libraries. Each build component compiles libraries such as SQLite and applies its own preprocessor flags and build logic for integration. As a result, separate projects repeatedly build the same library sources instead of compiling them once and reusing them as a static library across the solution.\nThis approach presents several challenges: there is no unified solution for dependency management, each build configuration requires manual upkeep, and library usage is inconsistent across components.\nMicrosoft’s sandboxed build environment automates software compilation, packaging, and deployment in local and cloud environments. Projects build independently on isolated cloud machines, supporting continuous integration workflows and simplifying build tracking, diagnostics, and artifact distribution. The lack of internet access and Visual Studio in this sandboxed build environment presents additional challenges for acquiring and maintaining open-source native libraries.\nBuild Integration\nAfter the prototype is successfully completed, the project was scaled up across the entire build environment.\nTo avoid high maintenance costs, the team generates custom vcpkg triplets during the build process. Custom triplets allow developers to define specific build configurations (e.g., platform, architecture, compiler settings) tailored to the project. This flexibility is essential for our heterogeneous build environments and helps ensure compatibility across legacy and modern components.\n\nTriplet Generator Projects:\nDynamically create custom vcpkg triplets during the build process.\nEliminate the need for checked-in triplets, reducing maintenance overhead.\nAutomatically configure toolset paths and compiler settings (PATH, INCLUDE, LIB).\nEnsure consistent library configurations and IntelliSense support across all projects.\nInternal Asset Caching Tool:\nSecurely retrieves Open-Source Software (OSS) dependencies from internal registries.\nResolves challenges related to restricted or offline build environments.\nEnsures compliance and traceability for third-party libraries.\nLibrary Integration:\nLibraries such as SQLite, libuv, and cereal are built in a consistent and reproducible way.\nProvides seamless integration with MSBuild.\nMinimizes manual configuration and improves build reliability.\nSandboxed Build Environment Integration\n\nChallenges Addressed:\nIntroduced dedicated build nodes to handle vcpkg installation tasks efficiently.\nLeveraged triplet generator projects to override and improve CloudBuild’s native vcpkg integration.\nEnsured libraries are built once and reliably reused across dependent projects, reducing redundant builds and improving consistency.\nConclusion\nvcpkg has emerged as Microsoft’s preferred solution for C++ dependency management, with many teams using it to address their needs. By adopting vcpkg, we were able to drive increased productivity, security compliance and consistency across our engineering processes.\nInterested in learning more?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At Meta, we use invisible watermarking for a variety of content provenance use cases on our platforms.\nInvisible watermarking serves a number of use cases, including detecting AI-generated videos, verifying who posted a video first, and identifying the source and tools used to create a video.\nWe’re sharing how we overcame the challenges of scaling invisible watermarking, including how we built a CPU-based solution that offers comparable performance to GPUs, but with better operational efficiency.\nInvisible watermarking is a powerful media-processing technique that allows us to embed a signal into media in a way that’s imperceptible to humans but detectable by software. This technology offers a robust solution for content provenance tagging (an indication of where the content came from), enabling the identification and tracking of content to support various use cases. At its core, invisible watermarking works by subtly modifying pixel values in images, waveforms in audio, or text tokens generated by large language models (LLMs) to embed a small amount of data. The design of watermarking systems adds necessary redundancy; this ensures the embedded identification remains persistent through transcodes and editing, unlike metadata tags that can be lost.\nBringing an invisible watermarking solution to production at scale presents many challenges. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how we overcame challenges with deployment environments, bitrate increases, and visual quality regressions to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nSome Helpful Definitions\nDigital watermarking, steganography, and invisible watermarking are related concepts, but it’s important to understand their differences:\nFeature\nDigital Watermarking\nSteganography\nInvisible Watermarking\n\n\nPurpose\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\nSecret communication\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\n\n\nVisibility\nVisible or invisible\nInvisible\nInvisible\n\n\nRobustness\nagainst content modifications\nMedium to high\nUsually low\nHigh (survives edits)\n\n\nPayload / Message  Capacity\nMedium (varies)\nVaries\nMedium (e.g., >64 bits)\n\n\nComputational Cost\nLow (visible) to high (invisible)\nVaries\nHigh (advanced ML models)\n\n\n\n\nThe Need for Robust Content Tagging\nIn today’s digital landscape, where content is constantly shared, remixed, and even AI-generated, important questions arise:\nWho Published the Video First?\nIn the photos in Figure 1, you can see two different user names, but there’s no visual indicator of who uploaded this image first. Invisible watermarking can help identify the first time a video was uploaded.\nFigure 1: Screenshots of what appear to be the same video uploaded by two users on Instagram Reels.\nIs It Even a Real Image?\nWith increasingly realistic generative AI (GenAI) videos, distinguishing between real and AI-generated content is increasingly challenging. Invisible watermarking can be used to infer if content such as in Figure 2 is AI-generated.\nFigure 2: An AI-generated image.\nWhat Camera Was Used? \nWhen encountering a compelling image or video like the one in Figure 3, people often wonder about the source and tools used for creation. Invisible watermarking can infer this information directly.\nFigure 3: A screenshot from a video captured with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nTraditional methods such as visual watermarks (which can be distracting) or metadata tags (which can be lost if a video is edited or re-encoded) do not address these challenges adequately and robustly. Due to its persistence and imperceptibility, invisible watermarking presents a superior alternative.\nThe Scaling Journey: From GPUs to CPUs\nEarlier digital watermarking research (starting in the 1990s) employed digital signal-processing techniques (such as DCT and DWT) to modify an image’s spectral properties to hide imperceptible information. Although these methods proved highly effective for static images and were considered a “solved problem,” they are not adequately robust against the various types of geometric transformations and filtering we see in social media and other real-world applications. \nToday’s state-of-the-art solutions (such as VideoSeal) use machine-learning (ML) techniques providing significantly improved robustness against the type of edits seen in social media. However, the application of solutions to the video problem domain (i.e., frame-by-frame watermarking) may be prohibitively computationally expensive without the necessary inference optimizations. \nGPUs may seem an obvious solution for deploying ML-based video watermarking solutions. However, most types of GPU hardware are specialized for the training and inference of large-scale models (such as LLMs and diffusion models). They have partial or no support for video transcoding (compression and decompression). Enabling invisible watermarking for videos has therefore posed unique challenges for our existing video-processing software (FFmpeg) and hardware stack (GPUs without video-transcoding capabilities or other custom accelerators for video processing without efficient ML-model inference capabilities). \nGPU Optimization Attempts and the Shift to CPUs\nOur embedding architecture uses FFmpeg with a custom filter to compute and apply invisible watermark masks to the videos. The filter acts as a reusable block that can be added easily to existing video processing pipelines. Migrating to a more optimal inference service for warmed-up models would mean sacrificing the flexibility of our FFmpeg filter, so for our application that was not an option.\nProfiling our invisible watermarking filter revealed low GPU utilization. We implemented frame batching and threading in the filter, but these efforts yielded no significant improvements to latency or utilization. GPUs with hardware video encoders and decoders can more easily reach high throughput, but the GPUs available for our service lack video encoders, requiring frames to be sent back to the CPU for encoding. Here a software video encoder can end up being a major bottleneck for pipelines using low-complexity ML models on a GPU.\nSpecifically, we encountered three primary bottlenecks:\nData transfer overhead: Transferring high-resolution input video frames back and forth between CPUs and multiple GPUs posed challenges to thread and memory optimizations, yielding suboptimal GPU utilization. \nInference latency: Processing multiple invisible watermarking requests across multiple GPUs in parallel on the same host led to a dramatic increase in inference latency.\nModel loading time: Despite the model’s small size, loading the model consumed a significant portion of the total processing time. Relying on FFmpeg prevented us from using warmed-up, pre-loaded models on the GPUs.\nRecognizing these limitations, we began investigating CPU-only inference. The embedder’s neural network architecture is more favorable to GPUs, and initial benchmarks showed that end-to-end (E2E) performance was more than two times slower on CPUs. By adjusting threading parameters for the encoder, decoder, and PyTorch, and optimizing sampling parameters used by the invisible watermarking filter, we saw significant improvements. \nUltimately, with properly tuned threading and embedding parameters, the E2E latency for running invisible watermarking on a CPU in a single process was within 5% of GPU performance. Crucially, we could run multiple FFmpeg processes in parallel on CPUs without increased latency. This breakthrough allowed us to calculate the capacity needed and achieve a more operationally efficient solution compared to a GPU-based solution.\nTo validate our CPU solution’s scalability in a distributed system, we conducted comprehensive load tests. Given a pool of CPU workers, we generated test traffic at increasing request rates to identify the peak performance point before per-request latency began to rise. For comparison, we used the same parameters with GPU inference on a pool of GPU workers with similar capabilities. The results confirmed that our CPU solution could perform at scale, comparable to our local test findings. This achievement allowed us to provision the required capacity with greater operational efficiency compared to a GPU-based approach.\nOptimization Considerations and Trade-offs\nDeploying invisible watermarking at scale presented several optimization challenges, primarily involving trade-offs between four metrics:\nLatency: The speed at which the watermarking process occurs\nWatermark detection bit-accuracy: The accuracy of detecting embedded watermarks\nVisual quality: Ensuring the embedded watermark is imperceptible to the human eye\nCompression efficiency (measured by BD-Rate): Ensuring the embedded watermark does not significantly increase bitrate\nOptimizing for one metric may negatively impact others. For example, a stronger watermark for higher bit accuracy might lead to visible artifacts and increased bitrate. We can’t create a perfectly optimal solution for all four metrics si\nManaging BD-Rate Impact\nInvisible watermarking, while imperceptible, introduces increased entropy, which can lead to a higher bitrate for video encoders. Our initial implementation showed a BD-Rate regression of around 20%, meaning users would need more bandwidth to watch a watermarked video. To mitigate this, we devised a novel frame-selection method for watermarking so that the BD-Rate impact is largely reduced while increasing visual quality and minimally impacting watermark bit detection accuracy.\nAddressing Regressions in Visual Quality \nWe need to ensure the “invisible” watermark remains truly invisible. We initially observed noticeable visual artifacts despite high-quality metric scores (VMAF and SSIM).\nWe addressed the visual-quality evaluations by implementing a custom post-processing technique and iterating through different embedding settings through crowdsourced manual inspections. This subjective evaluation was crucial for unblocking us, as traditional visual quality metrics proved insufficient for detecting the type of artifact an invisible watermark can at times introduce. As we tuned the algorithm for human invisibility, we closely monitored the bit accuracy impact to achieve an optimal balance between visual quality and detection accuracy.\nLearnings and the Road Ahead\nOur journey to deploy a scalable, invisible watermarking solution provided valuable insights:\nWith proper optimizations, CPU-only pipelines can reach performances comparable to GPU pipelines for specific use cases at much lower cost. Contrary to our initial assumptions, with the right optimizations CPUs offered us a more operationally efficient and scalable solution for our invisible-watermarking system. While GPUs are still faster for the invisible watermark model inference, we were able to use optimizations to bring down the overall compute and latency with the CPU fleet.\nTraditional video quality scores are insufficient for invisible watermarking: We learned that metrics like VMAF and SSIM do not fully capture the perceptual quality issues introduced by invisible watermarking, necessitating manual inspection. More research is needed to develop a metric to programmatically detect the visual-quality loss incurred by invisible watermarking.\nThe quality bar for production use is high: Watermarking techniques may not directly apply to real-world use cases due to the impact on BD-Rate and downstream video compression. We needed to expand upon the literature to keep BD-Rate impacts low while maintaining excellent bit accuracy for detection.\nWe successfully shipped a scalable watermarking solution with excellent latency, visual quality, detection bit accuracy, and a minimal BD-Rate impact.\nAs our North Star goal, we aim to continue to improve the precision and copy-detection recall with invisible watermark detection. This will involve further tuning of model parameters, pre- and post-processing steps, and video encoder settings. Ultimately, we envision invisible watermarking as a lightweight “filter block” that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of video use cases without product-specific tweaks, providing minimal impact on the user experience while offering robust content provenance.\nThe post Video Invisible Watermarking at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

From hands-on advice to thought-provoking pieces, we’ve gathered a nice selection of stories that will help you stay sharp and inspired in the tech world.\nWe’re also happy to have Josh Long as our featured content author this month! Expect some top-notch insights and a good dose of Spring.\nSo, grab your coffee and dive in – there’s plenty worth reading inside!\nFeatured Content\nJosh Long \nJosh Long works on the Spring team as its number one fan. You can find more of his content – blogs, Youtube content, podcasts, etc. – on his website.\nHi, Spring fans! Spring Boot 4 comes out in November 2025! With this in mind, lLet’s at least look at some of my favorite features together. Jakarta EE 11 is the new baseline. We’ve retained a Java 17 baseline but strongly encourage a Java 25 posture whenever possible. We’ve moved the baseline to GraalVM 25 for native images and updated our Kotlin support to Kotlin 2.2. The new generation of projects assumes the new Jackson 3. We’ve introduced JSpecify nullability annotations across the portfolio to finally eliminate Tony Hoare’s $1 billion dollar mistake – null references. Spring Boot 4 has decomposed the autoconfiguration artifact into smaller, more modular autoconfigurations.\nOne of my favorite new features is API versioning. Here’s a Spring MVC controller with two endpoints, each designated a particular version, the default version of which we can specify with spring.mvc.apiversion.default=1.1.\n@RestController\n\nclass DogsController {\n\n    ...\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\",version=\"1.0\")\n\n    Collection<Map<String, Object>> dogsClassic() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\", version = \"1.1\")\n\n    Collection<Dog> dogs() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\nI also love the new easy-mode declarative HTTP clients. Let’s build a client to talk to the Cat Facts API and then activate it using @ImportHttpServices(CatFacts.class):\nrecord CatFact(@JsonProperty(\"fact_number\") int factNumber, String fact) { }\n\nrecord CatFactsResponse(Collection<CatFact> facts) { }\n\ninterface CatFacts {\n\n    @GetExchange(\"https://www.catfacts.net/api\")\n\n    CatFactsResponse facts();\n\n}\nWe built a simple client, and it should work, but what if the service is down? In this case, we can enable resilient methods with Spring’s new @EnableResilientMethods annotation. This gives us two new features: @ConcurrencyLimit and @Retryable (and the related RetryTemplate).\n...\n\n    @ConcurrencyLimit(10)\n\n    @Retryable(maxAttempts = 4, includes = BadException.class)\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/facts\")\n\n    Collection<CatFact> facts()  throws Exception {\n\n        ...\n\n    }\n\n    ...\n    \nSpring Framework 7 brings BeanRegistrar configuration, which is a more dynamic alternative to Java configuration that can be used in conjunction with Java configuration and component scanning with the usual @Import annotation.\nclass MyBeanRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class, spec -> spec\n\n                .description(\"description\")\n\n                .supplier(supplierContext -> new Runner(\n\n                        supplierContext.bean(DogRepository.class), supplierContext.beanProvider(CatFacts.class)\n\n                        .getIfUnique())\n\n                ));\n\n    }\n\n}\nSpring Security brings with it a lot of nice new features. Two of my favorites are multi-factor auth, allowing you to require that multiple authentication factors be present, and Customizer<HttpSecurity> beans for additive changes to the HttpSecurity configuration.\n@EnableGlobalMultiFactorAuthentication(\n\n    authorities = { FactorGrantedAuthority.PASSWORD_AUTHORITY, FactorGrantedAuthority.OTT_AUTHORITY })\n\n@Configuration\n\nclass SecurityConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n\n    Customizer<HttpSecurity> httpSecurityCustomizer() {\n\n        return httpSecurity -> httpSecurity\n\n                .webAuthn(w -> ... )\n\n                .oneTimeTokenLogin(ott -> ... );\n\n    }\n\n}\nThe code is here for your reference.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the third post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nAll parts in the series:\nGetting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nEvaluating Kotlin in Real Projects\nGrowing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company\nSpread the Word: Win the Hearts and Minds of your Fellow Developers\nBy now, you have a core team convinced of Kotlin’s benefits. Now comes the critical phase: How do you expand adoption? \nKey in this phase is to win the hearts and minds of skeptical Java developers. Hard and soft factors can make the difference here:\nHard factors: the code\nLet the code speak\nSoft factors: support and connect developers\nFacilitate easy onboarding\nOffer self-study material\nEstablish an in-house Kotlin community\nBe patient…\nLet the code speak\nDouble down on the experience you gained by (re-)writing an application in Kotlin and show the benefits in a tangible, accessible way:\nShow, don’t tell: present the gained conciseness of Kotlin by comparing Java with Kotlin snippets. \nZoom out to focus on the overarching paradigms: Kotlin is not just different from Java: Kotlin is built on the foundation of safety, conciseness for maximal readability and maintainability, functions as a first-class citizen, and extensibility, which together solve fundamental shortcomings of Java, while still being fully interoperable with the Java ecosystem.\nHere are some tangible examples:\n1. Null-safety: No more billion-dollar mistakes \nJava\n//This is why we have the billion-dollar mistake (not only in Java…)\nBooking booking = null; //🤨 This is allowed but causes:\nbooking.destination; //Runtime error 😱\n\nOptional<Booking> booking = null; //Optionals aren’t safe from null either: 🤨\nbooking.map(Destination::destination); //Runtime error 😱\nJava has added some null-safety features over time, like Optional and Annotations (@NotNull etc.), but it has failed to solve this fundamental problem. Additionally, project Valhalla (Null-Restricted and Nullable types) will not introduce null-safety to Java, but rather provide more options to choose from. \nKotlin\n//Important to realize that null is very restricted in Kotlin:\nval booking:Booking? = null //…null can only be assigned to Nullable types ✅ \nval booking:Booking = null //null assigned to a Non-nullable types yields a Compilation error 😃 \n\nbooking.destination //unsafely accessing a nullable type directly causes a Compilation error 😃\nbooking?.destination //only safe access is possible  ✅\nThe great thing about Kotlin’s null-safety is that it is not only safe, but also offers great usability. A classic example of “have your cake and eat it, too”:\nSay we have this Domain:\nKotlin\ndata class Booking(val destination:Destination? = null)\ndata class Destination(val hotel:Hotel? = null)\ndata class Hotel(val name:String, val stars:Int? = null)\nJava\npublic record Booking(Optional<Destination> destination) {\n\n   public Booking() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Booking(Destination destination) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(destination));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Destination(Optional<Hotel> hotel) {\n\n   public Destination() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Destination(Hotel hotel) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(hotel));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Hotel(String name, Optional<Integer> stars) {\n\n   public Hotel(String name) {\n\n       this(name, Optional.empty());\n\n   }\n\n   public Hotel(String name, Integer stars) {\n       this(name, Optional.ofNullable(stars));\n   }\n}\nConstructing objects\nJava\n//Because Optional is a wrapper, the number of nested objects grows, which doesn’t help readability\nfinal Optional<Booking> booking = Optional.of(new Booking(\n      Optional.of(new Destination(Optional.of(\n            new Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5))))));\nKotlin\n//Since nullability is part of the type system, no wrapper is needed: The required type or null can be used. \nval booking:Booking? = Booking(Destination(Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5)))\nTraversing nested objects\nJava\n//traversing a graph of Optionals requires extensive unwrapping\nfinal var stars = \"*\".repeat(booking\n                          .flatMap(Booking::getDestination)\n                          .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n                          .map(Hotel::getStars).orElse(0)); //-> \"*****\"\nKotlin\n//Easily traverse a graph of nullable types with: ‘?’, use  ?: for the ‘else’ case.\nval stars = \"*\".repeat(booking?.destination?.hotel?.stars ?: 0) //-> \"*****\"\nUnwrap nested object\nJava\n//extensive unwrapping is also needed for printing a leaf \nbooking.getDestination()\n       .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n       .map(Hotel::getName)\n       .map(String::toUpperCase)\n         .ifPresent(System.out::println);\nKotlin\n//In Kotlin we have two elegant options:\n//1. we can again traverse the graph with ‘?’\nbooking?.destination?.hotel.?name?.uppercase()?.also(::println)\n\n//2. We can make use of Kotlin’s smart-cast feature\nif(booking?.destination?.hotel != null) {\n   //The compiler has checked that all the elements in the object graph are not null, so we can access the elements as if they were non-nullable types\n   println(booking.destination.hotel.uppercase())\n}\nThe lack of null-safety support in Java is a key pain-point for developers, leading to defensive programming, different nullability constructs (or none at all), including increased verbosity. Moreover, NullPointerExceptions are responsible for roughly one-third of application crashes (The JetBrains Blog). Kotlin’s compile-time null checking prevents these runtime failures entirely. That’s why, still today, Null-safety is the primary driver for migration to Kotlin.\n2. Collections are your friend, not your enemy\nThe creator of Spring, Rod Johnson, stated in a recent interview that it was not Nullable-types that made him try out Kotlin, but the overly complicated Java Streams API: Creator of Spring: No desire to write Java. \nThe following example depicts the various reasons why the Java Streams API is so horribly complicated and how Kotlin solves all of the issues:\nJava\npublic record Product(String name, int... ratings){}\nList<Product> products = List.of(\n  new Product(\"gadget\", 9, 8, 7), \n  new Product(\"goody\", 10, 9)\n);\n\nMap<String, Integer> maxRatingsPerProduct =\n\n   //🤨 1. Stream introduces indirection\n   products.stream()\n     //🤨 1. Always to and from Stream conversion\n      .collect(\n        //🤨 2. Lacks extension methods, so wrappers are required\n        Collectors.groupingBy(\n           Product::name,\n            //🤨 2. Again…\n           Collectors.mapping( groupedProducts ->\n                //🤨 3. (too) low-level types, arrays, and primitives cause extra complexity\n                //🤨 4. No API on Array, always wrap in stream \n               Arrays.stream(groupedProducts.ratings())\n                   .max()\n                      //🤨 5. Extra verbosity due to Optional\n                      .orElse(0.0),\n               //🤨 6. No named arguments: what does this do?\n                Collectors.reducing(0, Integer::max)\n              )\n            ));\nKotlin\n//😃 rich and uniform Collection API - even on Java collections - due to extension methods\nval maxRatingsPerProduct = products.\n      .groupBy { it.name }\n      .mapValues { (_, groupedProducts) -> //😃 destructuring for semantic precision\n            //😃 built-in nullability support, and the same API for \n            //arrays like other Collections\n            groupedProducts.flatMap { it.ratings }\n                  .maxOrNull() ?: 0 \n            }\n      }\nDue to Kotlin’s uniform Collection framework, converting between different collection types is very straightforward:\nJava\nint[] numbers = {1, 3, 3, 5, 2};\n\nSet<Integer> unique = Arrays.stream(numbers).boxed().collect(Collectors.toSet());\n\nMap<Integer, Boolean> evenOrOdd = unique.stream()\n       .collect(Collectors.toMap(\n               n -> n,\n               n -> n % 2 == 0));\nKotlin\nval numbers = arrayOf(1, 3, 3, 5, 2)\n\nval unique: Set<Int> = numbers.toSet() //😃 simply call to<Collection> to do the conversion\n\nval evenOrOdd: Map<Int, Boolean> = unique.associateWith { it % 2 == 0 }\nNet effect:\nFeature-rich, intuitive Collection API: pipelines read left-to-right like English, not inside nested collector calls.\nLess boilerplate and complexity: no Collectors.groupingBy, no Stream, no Optional, no Arrays.stream.\nOne mental model: whether you start with a List, Set, Array, or primitive array, you reach for the same collection operators.\nPerformance without pain: the compiler inserts boxing/unboxing only where unavoidable; you write normal code.\n​​Null-safety integrated: Collection API fully supports nullability with various helpers often suffixed with orNull(...).\nSeamless Java-interop with idiomatic wrappers: Due to extension methods, you get the “best of both worlds” – feature-rich Collections on top of Java collections.\nPut simply, Kotlin lifts the everyday collection tasks – filtering, mapping, grouping etc. – into first-class, composable functions, so you express what you want, not the ceremony of how to get there.\n3. No more checked Exceptions, yet safer code in Kotlin\nJava is one of the only languages that still supports checked Exceptions. Though initially implemented as a safety feature, they have not lived up to their promise. Their verbosity, pointless catch blocks that do nothing or rethrow as an Exception as a RuntimeException, and their misalignment with lambdas are a few reasons why they get in the way rather than making your code safer.\nKotlin follows the proven paradigm used by almost all other programming languages –C#, Python, Scala, Rust, and Go – of using exceptions only for unrecoverable situations.\nThe following examples highlight the obstacles that checked Exceptions introduce into your code, without adding any safety:\nJava\npublic String downloadAndGetLargestFile(List<String> urls) {\n   List<String> contents = urls.stream().map(urlStr -> {\n               Optional<URL> optional;\n               try {\n                   optional = Optional.of(new URI(urlStr).toURL());\n                   //🤨 Within lambdas checked exceptions are not supported and must always be caught...\n               } catch (URISyntaxException | MalformedURLException e) {\n                   optional = Optional.empty();\n               }\n               return optional;\n           }).filter(Optional::isPresent)       //Quite a mouthful to get rid of the Optional...\n           .map(Optional::get)\n           .map(url -> {\n               try (InputStream is = url.openStream()) {\n                   return new String(is.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n               } catch (IOException e) {\n                   //🤨… or re-thrown, which is annoying, I don’t really care about IOE\n                   throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);\n               }\n           }).toList();\n   //🤨 An empty List results in a NoSuchElementException, so why is it not checked? The chance that the List is empty is as high as the other two cases above...\n   return Collections.max(contents);\n}\nKotlin\n//😃 safe return type\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List<String>): String? =\n   urls.mapNotNull {    //😃 convenient utility methods to rid of null\n       //😃 try catch is possible, yet runCatching is an elegant way to convert an exception to null\n       runCatching { URI(it).toURL() }.getOrNull()\n   }.maxOfOrNull{  //😃 safe way to retrieve the max value\n       it.openStream().use{ it.reader().readText() }  //😃 convenient extension methods to make java.io streams fluent\n   }\n4. Functions as first-class citizens\nKotlin treats functions as first-class citizens, which may raise questions if you’re coming from Java: What does that mean, and why does it matter?\nThe key difference lies in Java’s limited approach – its functional capabilities focus mostly on the call-site via lambdas, while the declaration-side remains tied to verbose and less intuitive functional interfaces. In Kotlin, you can define, pass, return, and compose functions without any boilerplate, making functional programming far more expressive and natural.\nJava\npublic void doWithImage(\n      URL url, \n      //🤨 Function interfaces introduce an indirection: because we don’t see the signature of a Function we don’t know what a  BiConsumer does, unless we look it up\n      BiConsumer<String, BufferedImage> f) throws IOException {\n        f.accept(url.getFile(), ImageIO.read(url));\n}\n\n//🤨 Same here\npublic void debug(Supplier<String> f) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled()) {\n      logger.debug(\"Debug: \" + f.get());\n   }\n}\n\n//🤨 calling no-argument lambdas is verbose\ndebug(() -> \"expensive concat\".repeat(1000));\nKotlin\nfun doWithImage(\n   url: URL,\n  //😃 Kotlin has a syntax for declaring functions: from the signature, we see what goes in and what goes out \n   f:(String, BufferedImage) -> Unit) = \n      f(url.file, ImageIO.read(url))\n\n  //😃 same here: nothing goes in, a String goes out\nfun debug(msg: () -> String) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled) {\n            logger.debug(msg())\n   }\n}\n\n//😃 convenient syntax to pass a lambda: {<lambda body>}\ndebug{\"expensive concat\".repeat(1000)}\nKotlin provides a clear and concise syntax for declaring functions – just from the signature, you can immediately see what goes in and what comes out, without having to navigate to an external functional interface. \nJava “leaks” its functional programming features through a large set of java.util.function.* interfaces with verbose and complex signatures, which often makes functional programming cumbersome to use. Kotlin, by contrast, treats functions as first-class citizens: these interfaces remain hidden from the developer, yet remain fully interoperable with Java’s approach:\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, using functions in Kotlin is significantly more straightforward and intuitive, which lowers the threshold considerably for leveraging this powerful programming concept in your own code. \n5. Headache-free concurrency with coroutines\nIf you need high throughput, parallel processing within a single request, or streaming, the only option you have in Java is a reactive library, like Reactor and RxJava, available in frameworks like Spring WebFlux, Vert.X, Quarkus etc.\nThe problem with these libraries is that they are notoriously complicated, forcing you into functional programming. As such, they have a steep learning curve, yet it is very easy to make errors that can have dire consequences when the application is under load. That’s most probably why reactive programming never became mainstream. \nNote: VirtualThreads are not a replacement for reactive libraries, even though there is some overlap. VirtualThreads offer non-blocking I/O, but do not provide features such as parallel processing or reactive streams. Structured concurrency and Scoped Values will also enable parallel processing once the major frameworks have support for it. For reactive streams, you will always have to rely on a reactive library.\n\r\n\n        \nSo let’s assume you are a Java developer using Spring Boot and you want to make a parallel call within a single request. This is what you end up with: \n@PostMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\npublic Mono<User> storeUser(@RequestBody User user) {\n   Mono<URL> avatarMono = avatarService.randomAvatar();\n   Mono<Boolean> validEmailMono = emailService.verifyEmail(user.getEmail());\n   //🤨 what does ‘zip’ do?\n   return Mono.zip(avatarMono, validEmailMono).flatMap(tuple -> \n       if(!tuple.getT2()) //what is getT2()? It’s the validEmail Boolean…\n        //🤨 why can I not just throw an exception?\n         Mono.error(new InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid Email\"));\n       else personDao.save(UserBuilder.from(user)\n                                          .withAvatarUrl(tuple.getT1()));\n     );  \n  }\nEven though, from a runtime perspective, this code performs perfectly well, the accidental complexity introduced is enormous: \nThe code is dominated by Mono/Flux-es, throughout the whole call chain, which enforces you to wrap all domain objects.\nThere are many complex operators everywhere, like zip, flatMap, etc.\nYou cannot use standard programming constructs like throwing exceptions \nThe business intent of your code suffers significantly: the code focuses on Monos and flatMap, thereby obscuring what is truly happening from a business perspective.\nThe good news is that there is a powerful remedy in the form of Kotlin Coroutines. Coroutines can be framed as a reactive implementation on the language level. As such, they combine the best of both worlds: \nYou write sequential code like you did before.\nThe code is executed asynchronously / in parallel at runtime.\nThe above Java code converted to coroutines looks as follows:\n@GetMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\nsuspend fun storeUser(@RequestBody user:User):User = coroutineScope {\n   val avatarUrl = async { avatarService.randomAvatar() }\n   val validEmail = async { emailService.verifyEmail() }\n   if(!validEmail.await()) throw InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid email\")\n   personRepo.save(user.copy(avatar = avatarUrl.await()))\n}\nKotlin’s suspend keyword enables structured, non-blocking execution in a clear and concise manner. Together with async{} and await(), it facilitates parallel processing without the need for deeply nested callbacks or complex constructs such as Mono or CompletableFuture.\nThat’s why complexity will decrease, and developer joy and maintainability will increase, with the exact same performance characteristics. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Not all major Java-based web frameworks support Coroutines as well. Spring does an excellent job, as does Micronaut. Quarkus currently offers limited Coroutine support.\n6. But hey, Java is evolving too!\nJava keeps moving forward with features like records, pattern matching, and upcoming projects such as Amber, Valhalla, and Loom. This steady evolution strengthens the JVM and benefits the entire ecosystem.\nBut here’s the catch: most of these “new” Java features are things Kotlin developers have enjoyed for years. Null safety, value classes, top-level functions, default arguments, concise collections, and first-class functions are all baked into Kotlin’s design – delivered in a more unified and developer-friendly way. That’s why Kotlin code often feels cleaner, safer, and far more productive.\nAnd there is more: Kotlin also profits from Java’s innovation. JVM-level advances like Virtual Threads and Loom in general, or Valhalla’s performance boosts apply seamlessly to Kotlin too.\nIn short: Java evolves, but Kotlin was designed from day one to give developers the modern tools they need – making it a safe, modern, and forward-looking choice for building the future.\n\n\n\n\n7. Kotlin’s evolutionary advantage\nOlder programming languages inevitably carry legacy baggage compared to modern alternatives. Updating a language while supporting massive existing codebases presents unique challenges for language designers. Kotlin enjoys two crucial advantages:\nStanding on the shoulders of giants: Rather than reinventing the wheel, Kotlin’s initial design team gathered proven paradigms from major programming languages and unified them into a cohesive whole. This approach maximized evolutionary learning from the broader programming community.\nLearning from Java’s shortcomings: Kotlin’s designers could observe Java’s pitfalls and develop solid solutions from the ground up.\nFor deeper insights into Kotlin’s evolution, Andrey Breslav from Kotlin’s original design team gave an excellent talk at KotlinDevDay Amsterdam: Shoulders of Giants: Languages Kotlin Learned From – Andrey Breslav\nSoft factors: Support and connect developers in their Kotlin adoption journey\n1. Facilitate easy onboarding\nThe goal of the expressive Java vs. Kotlin code snippets is to whet the appetite for Kotlin. Code alone, however, is not enough to win the hearts and minds of Java developers. To accelerate adoption and ensure a smooth start, provide:\nSample project: A ready-to-run project with both Java and Kotlin code side-by-side, giving teams a practical reference during migration.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in quality checks: Preconfigured with tools like SonarQube, ktlint, and detekt to promote clean, consistent, and maintainable code from day one. This will enable you to apply consistent lint rules, testing frameworks, libraries, and CI pipelines to reduce friction across teams.\n\n\n\n\nCoaching and support: Experienced Kotlin engineers available to coach new teams, answer questions, and provide hands-on advice during the early stages of development.\n\nThis one is particularly important: with only a few hours of guidance from an experienced developer from another team who has gone through these stages before, much damage and technical debt can be prevented. \nA bit of support and coaching is the most powerful way to nurture lasting enthusiasm for Kotlin.\n2. Offer (self-)study material\nEspecially when coming from Java, learning the Kotlin basics can be done on your own. Providing some resources upfront eases the path to getting productive with Kotlin and lowers the threshold. \nJetBrains “Tour of Kotlin” (Get Started guide)\nA short, browser-based tutorial on the official Kotlin site.\nKotlin Koans\nA set of bite-sized coding challenges maintained by JetBrains.\nUdacity “Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers”\nA full video-based course created in partnership with Google.\nNote: Although self-study is valuable for grasping the basics, it also has some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is an optionality: being caught up in the day’s frenzy, it’s tempting to skip self-study. Moreover, you will lack feedback from a practitioner who knows the subtle nuances of correctly applied idiomatic Kotlin. There is a big chance that after a self-study course, you will write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits but does not unlock the full potential of the language. \nUnless you don’t have good coaching, a classical course can be very beneficial. There is a need to attend; you can exchange with peers of the same level and have your questions answered by an experienced professional, which will get you up to speed much faster with less non-idiomatic Kotlin during the initial transition. \n3. Establish an in-house Kotlin community\nOne of the fastest ways to level up Kotlin expertise across your company is to create and foremost nurture an in-house community.\nLaunch an internal Kotlin community\n\nFirst look for a core-team of at least 3–6 developers who are willing to invest in a Kotlin community. Also ensure they get time and credits from their managers for their task.\nOnce the team is formed, organize a company-wide kick-off with well-known speakers from the Kotlin community. This will ignite the Kotlin flame and give it momentum.\nSchedule regular meet-ups (monthly or bi-weekly) so momentum never drops.\nCreate a shared chat channel/wiki where questions, code snippets, and event notes live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvite (external) speakers\n\nBring in engineers who’ve shipped Kotlin in production to share candid war stories.\nAlternate between deep-dive technical talks (coroutines, KMP, functional programming) and higher-level case studies (migration strategies, tooling tips).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent lessons learned from other in-house projects\n\nAsk project leads to present their Kotlin learnings – what worked, what didn’t, and measurable outcomes.\nThese insights can be captured in a “Kotlin playbook” that new teams can pick up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your own developers the stage\n\nRun lightning-talk sessions where anyone can demo a neat trick, library, or failure they overcame in 5–10 minutes.\nCelebrate contributors publicly – shout-outs in all-hands or internal newsletters boost engagement and knowledge-sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep feedback loops tight\n\nAfter each session, collect quick polls on clarity and usefulness, then tweak future agendas accordingly.\nRotate organizational duties so the community doesn’t hinge on a single champion and stays resilient long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Many of the suggestions above sound straightforward. However, the effort needed to keep a community vibrant and alive should not be underestimated. \n4. Be patient…\nCultural change takes time. The danger of being enthusiastic about a tool that makes a difference for you is pushing things, which can be counterproductive. An effective approach is to nurture the adoption process with all the activities discussed above, with show, don’t tell as prior guidance.\nUp next in the series\nWe shift focus from convincing developers to persuading decision-makers. The next post shows how to build a compelling business case for Kotlin adoption, grounded in real data and measurable outcomes. You’ll learn how to translate developer wins into management arguments, link productivity gains to cost savings, and demonstrate why Kotlin is more than a technical upgrade – it’s a strategic move for teams and companies alike.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving domain of software development, Python has established itself as a premier language, renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It underpins a vast range of applications, from web development to artificial intelligence and data engineering. However, beneath its elegant syntax lies a potential challenge: performance bottlenecks that can transform otherwise efficient scripts into noticeably sluggish processes.\nWhether the task involves processing large datasets, developing real-time systems, or refining computational efficiency, optimizing Python code for speed can be a decisive factor in achieving superior results.\nThis guide presents 10 rigorously tested performance-enhancement strategies. Drawing upon Python’s built-in capabilities, efficient data structures, and low-level optimization techniques, it offers practical methods to accelerate code execution without compromising the language’s characteristic clarity and elegance. Supported by empirical benchmarks and illustrative code examples, these techniques demonstrate how incremental improvements can yield substantial performance gains – empowering developers to transition from proficient practitioners to true experts in high-performance Python programming.\nLet’s dive in and turbocharge your Python prowess!\nHack 1: Leverage sets for membership testing\nWhen you need to check whether an element exists within a collection, using a list can be inefficient – especially as the size of the list grows. Membership testing with a list (x in some_list) requires scanning each element one by one, resulting in linear time complexity (O(n)):\nbig_list = list(range(1000000))\nbig_set = set(big_list)\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_list)\nprint(f\"List lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_set)\nprint(f\"Set lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\nTime measured:\nList lookup: ~0.015000s\nSet lookup: ~0.000020s\nIn contrast, sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, which allow for constant-time (O(1)) lookups on average. This means that checking whether a value exists in a set is significantly faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.\nFor tasks like filtering duplicates, validating input, or cross-referencing elements between collections, sets are far more efficient than lists. They not only speed up membership tests but also make operations like unions, intersections, and differences much faster and more concise.\nBy switching from lists to sets for membership checks – particularly in performance-critical code – you can achieve meaningful speed gains with minimal changes to your logic.\nHack 2: Avoid unnecessary copies\nCopying large objects like lists, dictionaries, or arrays can be costly in both time and memory. Each copy creates a new object in memory, which can lead to significant overhead, especially when working with large datasets or within tight loops.\nWhenever possible, modify objects in place instead of creating duplicates. This reduces memory usage and improves performance by avoiding the overhead of allocating and populating new structures. Many built-in data structures in Python provide in-place methods (e.g. sort, append, update) that eliminate the need for copies.\nnumbers = list(range(1000000))\ndef modify_list(lst):\n    lst[0] = 999\n    return lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = modify_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"In-place: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef copy_list(lst):\n    new_lst = lst.copy()\n    new_lst[0] = 999\n    return new_lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = copy_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"Copy: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nIn-place: ~0.0001s\nCopy: ~0.0100s\nIn performance-critical code, being mindful of when and how objects are duplicated can make a noticeable difference. By working with references and in-place operations, you can write more efficient and memory-friendly code, particularly when handling large or complex data structures.\nHack 3: Use __slots__ for memory efficiency\nBy default, Python classes store instance attributes in a dynamic dictionary (__dict__), which offers flexibility but comes with memory overhead and slightly slower attribute access.\nUsing __slots__ allows you to explicitly declare a fixed set of attributes for a class. This eliminates the need for a __dict__, reducing memory usage – which is especially beneficial when creating many instances of a class. It also leads to marginally faster attribute access due to the simplified internal structure.\nWhile __slots__ does restrict dynamic attribute assignment, this trade-off is often worthwhile in memory-constrained environments or performance-sensitive applications. For lightweight classes or data containers, applying __slots__ is a simple way to make your code more efficient.\nclass Point:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\nstart = time.time()\npoints = [Point(i, i+1) for i in range(1000000)]\nprint(f\"With slots: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nWith __slots__: ~0.1200s\nWithout __slots__: ~0.1500s\nHack 4: Use math functions instead of operators\nFor numerical computations, Python’s math module provides functions that are implemented in C, offering better performance and precision than equivalent operations written in pure Python.\nFor example, using math.sqrt() is typically faster and more accurate than raising a number to the power of 0.5 using the exponentiation (**) operator. Similarly, functions like math.sin(), math.exp(), and math.log() are highly optimized for speed and reliability.\nThese performance benefits become especially noticeable in tight loops or large-scale calculations. By relying on the math module for heavy numerical work, you can achieve both faster execution and more consistent results – making it the preferred choice for scientific computing, simulations, or any math-heavy code.\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm makes it even easier to take advantage of the math module by providing intelligent code completion. Simply typing math. triggers a dropdown list of all available mathematical functions and constants – such as sqrt(), sin(), cos(), log(), pi, and many more – along with inline documentation. \nThis not only speeds up development by reducing the need to memorize function names, but also encourages the use of optimized, built-in implementations over custom or operator-based alternatives. By leveraging these hints, developers can quickly explore the full breadth of the module and write cleaner, faster numerical code with confidence.\nimport math\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [math.sqrt(n) for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Math sqrt: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [n ** 0.5 for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Operator: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nmath.sqrt: ~0.2000s\nOperator: ~0.2500s\nHack 5: Pre-allocate memory with known sizes\nWhen building lists or arrays dynamically, Python resizes them in the background as they grow. While convenient, this resizing involves memory allocation and data copying, which adds overhead – especially in large or performance-critical loops.\nIf you know the final size of your data structure in advance, pre-allocating memory can significantly improve performance. By initializing a list or array with a fixed size, you avoid repeated resizing and allow Python (or libraries like NumPy) to manage memory more efficiently.\nThis technique is particularly valuable in numerical computations, simulations, and large-scale data processing, where even small optimizations can add up. Pre-allocation helps reduce fragmentation, improves cache locality, and ensures more predictable performance.\nstart = time.time()\nresult = [0] * 1000000\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result[i] = i\nprint(f\"Pre-allocated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result.append(i)\nprint(f\"Dynamic: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nPre-allocated: ~0.0300s\nDynamic: ~0.0400s\nHack 6: Avoid exception handling in hot loops\nWhile Python’s exception handling is powerful and clean for managing unexpected behavior, it’s not designed for high-frequency use inside performance-critical loops. Raising and catching exceptions involves stack unwinding and context switching, which are relatively expensive operations.\nIn hot loops – sections of code that run repeatedly or process large volumes of data – using exceptions for control flow can significantly degrade performance. Instead, use conditional checks (if, in, is, etc.) to prevent errors before they occur. This proactive approach is much faster and leads to more predictable execution.\nReserving exceptions for truly exceptional cases, rather than expected control flow, results in cleaner and faster code – especially in tight loops or real-time applications where performance matters.\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    if i % 2 != 0:\n        total += i // 2\n    else:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Conditional: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    try:\n        total += i / (i % 2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Exception: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nConditional: ~0.3000s\nException: ~0.6000s\nHack 7: Use local functions for repeated logic\nWhen a specific piece of logic is used repeatedly within a function, defining it as a local (nested) function – also known as a closure – can improve performance and organization. Local functions benefit from faster name resolution because Python looks up variables more quickly in local scopes than in global ones.\nIn addition to the performance gain, local functions help encapsulate logic, making your code cleaner and more modular. They can also capture variables from the enclosing scope, allowing you to write more flexible and reusable inner logic without passing extra arguments.\nThis technique is particularly useful in functions that apply the same operation multiple times, such as loops, data transformations, or recursive processes. By keeping frequently used logic local, you reduce both runtime overhead and cognitive load.\nHint: Use AI Assistant’s Suggest Refactoring\nIf you’re using PyCharm (or any JetBrains product) with the AI Assistant plugin, one particularly powerful tool is Suggest Refactoring. With it, you can select a segment of code, invoke the AI Assistant, and ask it to propose cleaner or more efficient alternatives – all in one go. \nThe assistant shows you a “refactored” version of your code, lets you view the diff (what would change), and you can accept either selected snippets or the whole block. This helps maintain consistency, enforce best practices, and catch opportunities for improvement you might otherwise miss.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Suggest Refactoring\nHere are step-by-step instructions (as per JetBrains’ documentation) on how to use this feature:\nSelect the code fragment you want to refactor.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the popup appears (e.g. small lightbulb or context menu), click the AI Assistant icon.\n\n\n\n\nChoose Suggest Refactoring in the menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe AI Chat pane then opens with its proposed refactorings. In it, you can:\nClick Show Diff to compare the original against the proposed code.\n\n\n\n\nOr if you prefer, you can select Apply Immediately to skip the diff and apply the suggestion directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the suggested changes, click Accept on individual snippets (in the gutter) or Accept All to replace the entire selected fragment.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t like the suggestions, you can always close the diff or dialog without applying.\ndef outer():\n    def add_pair(a, b):\n        return a + b\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(10000000):\n        result = add_pair(result, i)\n    return result\nstart = time.time()\nresult = outer()\nprint(f\"Local function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef add_pair(a, b):\n    return a + b\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(10000000):\n    result = add_pair(result, i)\nprint(f\"Global function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nLocal function: ~0.4000s\nGlobal function: ~0.4500s\nHack 8: Use itertools for combinatorial operations\nWhen dealing with permutations, combinations, Cartesian products, or other iterator-based tasks, Python’s itertools module provides a suite of highly efficient, C-optimized tools tailored for these use cases.\nFunctions like product(), permutations(), combinations(), and combinations_with_replacement() generate elements lazily, meaning they don’t store the entire result in your computer’s memory. This allows you to work with large or infinite sequences without the performance or memory penalties of manual implementations.\nIn addition to being fast, itertools functions are composable and memory-efficient, making them ideal for complex data manipulation, algorithm development, and problem-solving tasks like those found in simulations, search algorithms, or competitive programming. When performance and scalability matter, itertools is a go-to solution.\nfrom itertools import product\nitems = [1, 2, 3] * 10\nstart = time.time()\nresult = list(product(items, repeat=2))\nprint(f\"Itertools: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor x in items:\n    for y in items:\n        result.append((x, y))\nprint(f\"Loops: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nitertools: ~0.0005s\nLoops: ~0.0020s\nHack 9: Use bisect for sorted list operations\nWhen working with sorted lists, using linear search or manual insertion logic can be inefficient – especially as the list grows. Python’s bisect module provides fast, efficient tools for maintaining sorted order using binary search.\nWith functions like bisect_left(), bisect_right(), and insort(), you can perform insertions and searches in O(log n) time, as opposed to the O(n) complexity of a simple scan. This is particularly useful in scenarios like maintaining leaderboards, event timelines, or implementing efficient range queries.\nBy using bisect, you avoid re-sorting after every change and gain a significant performance boost when working with dynamic, sorted data. It’s a lightweight and powerful tool that brings algorithmic efficiency to common list operations.\nimport bisect\nnumbers = sorted(list(range(0, 1000000, 2)))\nstart = time.time()\nbisect.insort(numbers, 75432)\nprint(f\"Bisect: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nfor i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n    if num > 75432:\n        numbers.insert(i, 75432)\n        break\nprint(f\"Loop: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nbisect: ~0.0001s\nLoop: ~0.0100s\nHack 10: Avoid repeated function calls in loops\nCalling the same function multiple times inside a loop – especially if the function is expensive or produces the same result each time – can lead to unnecessary overhead. Even relatively fast functions can accumulate significant cost when called repeatedly in large loops.\nTo optimize, compute the result once outside the loop and store it in a local variable. This reduces function call overhead and improves runtime efficiency, particularly in performance-critical sections of code.\nThis technique is simple but effective. It not only speeds up execution but also enhances code clarity by signaling that the value is constant within the loop’s context. Caching function results is one of the easiest ways to eliminate redundant computation and make your code more efficient.\ndef expensive_operation():\n    time.sleep(0.001)\n    return 42\nstart = time.time()\ncached_value = expensive_operation()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += cached_value\nprint(f\"Cached: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += expensive_operation()\nprint(f\"Repeated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nCached: ~0.0010s\nRepeated: ~1.0000s\nIn summary\nFrom leveraging the inherent efficiency of Python’s built-in functions and high-performance libraries such as NumPy to employing memory-conscious techniques with __slots__ and generators, these fifteen Python performance strategies provide a comprehensive set of tools for enhancing execution speed. \nThe methods explored include optimizing iterative processes with comprehensions, utilizing sets for rapid membership checks, avoiding unnecessary data copies and exception handling overhead, and applying bitwise operations as arithmetic shortcuts.\nSpecialized modules such as itertools, bisect, and collections further streamline complex tasks, while adherence to best practices – such as minimizing the use of global variables, pre-allocating memory, and implementing caching – ensures lean, efficient code execution. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that even minor adjustments can yield significant time savings in large-scale operations, reinforcing the principle that effective optimization does not necessitate a complete code rewrite.\nWhether refining a standalone script or scaling a production-level application, these techniques, when applied judiciously, can significantly enhance performance while conserving system resources. Ultimately, the most effective optimizations strike a balance between speed and clarity.\nAbout the author\nDido Grigorov\nDido is a seasoned Deep Learning Engineer and Python programmer with an impressive 17 years of experience in the field.

They bring new languages, tools, and small improvements that make everyday coding smoother.\nMany of the best ones come from independent developers. One of them is Dmitrii Derepko, who built several handy tools for working with web projects and PHP. Below are a few of his creations worth checking out.\nIf you’re curious about plugin development, don’t miss the JetBrains Plugin Developer Conference 2025  – free online conference. Dmitrii will be speaking there and will walk you through plugin creation basics: from the initial setup to releasing it on JetBrains Marketplace.\n.​gitattributes support\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever worked with libraries distributed through Composer, NPM, or other package managers, you’ve probably seen a .gitattributes file. It controls how your project looks when archived (via git archive) and which files get included or excluded when users install your package.\nThe .gitattributes Support plugin adds first-class editing experience for this file in PhpStorm. It highlights syntax, recognizes attribute rules, and even suggests valid options while you type so you don’t have to look them up each time. Small details, but they make editing smoother and help prevent mistakes.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nGit Codeowners\n\n\n\n\nIf you use GitHub or GitLab, you’ve probably seen a CODEOWNERS file. It tells your platform who’s responsible for reviewing pull requests that touch specific parts of the codebase.\nThe Git CODEOWNERS plugin makes editing this file painless. It autocompletes file paths, suggests team names, and validates syntax to prevent mistakes before you commit.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nCron / Crontab Support\n\n\n\n\nCron is the classic tool for running tasks on a schedule. But remembering its five-field syntax is… painful.\nThis plugin highlights errors in your cron expressions, translates them into plain English (“runs every Monday at 3 AM”), and even lets you execute commands directly from PhpStorm – no need to switch to the terminal.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nSitemap Support\n\n\n\n\nSitemaps tell search engines which URLs your site exposes and when they were last updated.\nThis plugin gives you a table-like XML editor for editing and inspecting sitemap files. You can view indexed vs. non-indexed pages, search or filter entries, and tweak URLs by hand if your generator misses something.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nTempestPHP\nA work-in-progress plugin that adds support for Tempest (an upcoming new PHP framework) to PhpStorm. Features include support for its custom view syntax, route- and view file support, autocompletion for database models, and more.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace \n💻 Source code on GitHub\nBuggregator\n\n\n\n\nBuggregator is a visual debugging toolkit that lets you inspect data dumps right inside PhpStorm. \nJust call trap() in your PHP code, and the plugin automatically spins up a local server that listens for these calls and renders the data in a docked panel — no browser tabs, no context switching.\nIt also works seamlessly with the libraries you already use, like Ray, Symfony/VarDumper, Monolog, Sentry, etc.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nPHP Dump\n\n\n\n\nPHP Dump builds on PHP Opcodes Language to visualize your code’s compiled output in real time.\nIt tokenizes the current file, shows the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), and displays Opcache details. It helps you understand why a specific function might run slower than expected, without ever executing it.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nFileSystem Info\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you just want to know which files in your project are taking up space or sitting forgotten.\nFileSystem Info scans your project tree and adds file sizes in the project structure tree so you can quickly spot large files.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nGit Churn\n\n\n\n\nGit Churn shows you which files in your repository change too often or never change at all.\nFrequent edits usually signal overly complex or unstable code. This plugin helps you spot those hotspots so you can refactor with purpose instead of guesswork.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for this roundup – a few plugins that make PhpStorm just a bit smarter.\nIf you ever had an idea for a PhpStorm plugin or run into something that could be automated or improved, drop it in the comments – maybe Dmitrii (or someone else from the community) will take it on next!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Modern IDEs are powerful tools with many useful features. When we talk about developer productivity, one thing that comes to mind is mastering the IDE – learning its features, like refactorings, navigation, or code generation, and remembering how to invoke them.\nHowever, discovering all the relevant features of your IDE, and knowing when and how to use them can be challenging. Once you know a given feature exists, there are different ways to invoke it:\n Shortcuts are fast, but it is hard to remember all of them.\n Search Everywhere (⇧⇧) is great, but it pulls you out of your flow.\n Intention actions (Alt+Enter) help, but they are discoverable only when the IDE points them out.\nOur research shows that most developers can only confidently recall a few shortcuts, for example (often three or fewer). The number of useful IDE actions we need is far greater than this. When the right shortcut is hard to find or remember, we rely on menus, hints, and other visual helpers. That’s how IDEs have evolved for years: layering discoverability tools around a keyboard-driven core.\nOne feature every developer does use is code completion. Start typing, and the IDE suggests keywords, variables, or method names. Press the dot button (.) and see relevant API members and templates – it’s so natural that modern development feels impossible without it. Now, we aim to extend this familiar experience beyond code – to the IDE itself. This way, you can discover and execute actions the same way you complete code: context-aware, inline, and without breaking your flow.\n\n\nA brief overview of the command completion feature\n\n\n\nIntroducing command completion\nTo help you unlock the full potential of your IDE, we are offering a universal entry point to relevant actions. \nCommand completion is our attempt to provide a new way to access context-aware actions directly from your editor. It extends the existing code completion (accessible via .) that many developers are already using. Command completion works like regular completion, but in addition to classes, methods, and templates, the popup also suggests actions relevant to your current context.\nType . to see code completion, postfix completion, and action suggestions.\nType .. to filter completion suggestions to actions only.\nSelect the action to see the exact context and preview what the action will do if applied.\nTo enable this Beta feature in 2025.2, go to Settings | Editor | General | Code Completion | Command Completion and select Enable command completion.\nEnable Command Completion in settings (IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2)\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with command completion\nCommand completion offers you context-sensitive relevant actions. Depending on where you are in the editor, the list of suggestions may include:\nFixes for issues – quick-fixes and warnings directly from the completion popup.\nCode transformations – actions like Introduce local variable, Reformat code, or Convert to Markdown documentation comment (Java 23+), for example.\nRefactoring and navigation – commonly used actions such as Rename or Go to declaration, as well as context-specific ones like Change signature, may appear when relevant.\nCode generation – options to generate things like constructors or getters/setters, as well as toString() or test methods.\nIn frameworks, IntelliJ IDEA may also suggest relevant actions (e.g. Spring bean wiring). The feature is still evolving, and more framework- and file-type support will be added. Our goal is to provide a seamless typing experience with commands in every environment, even binaries. \nHow does command completion compare to existing features?\nIntelliJ IDEA already has multiple ways to use existing features. Let’s see how command completion compares:\nShortcuts – are great for speed, especially for frequently used actions, but learning shortcuts requires effort. This means there is a steep learning curve, and powerful features often go underused. The pool of meaningful key combinations is limited, and most shortcuts are not intuitive or memorable. Command completion is easier to use, since it does not require you to remember shortcuts; only the action you want to perform.\nIntention actions (Alt+Enter) – IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code and highlights issues or improvements. Intention actions provide quick-fixes, but excessive highlighting can sometimes be distracting. Quick-fixes are reactive and limited to detected issues. Intention actions offer only a limited set of actions. Command completion offers you all the actions that are relevant to your current context. The list of actions is searchable, so you can find what you need.\nPostfix completion – Built-in templates let you quickly transform an existing expression with a single, meaningful suffix. For example,  .var transforms an existing expression into a properly declared variable, allowing you to keep moving forward when writing code. They require you to know about them, to know a template exists, or to be able to quickly find it. Command completion extends this idea to all actions, without requiring you to know the exact names of templates or commands.\nSearch Everywhere (⇧⇧) – This feature allows you to find anything inside IntelliJ IDEA. However, it requires multiple steps to perform an actual action: You have to open the dialog, type the name of the desired action (which requires you to know the name), navigate the results, and confirm the action; all of which pull you out of your coding flow. More importantly, it’s detached from the current code context. Command completion keeps you in the editor, in your current context, offering only actions that are relevant there.\nCode completion – In IntelliJ IDEA, code completion will automatically appear where relevant. It can also be explicitly invoked by typing a dot (.) or the shortcut (⌃␣ on macOS) / Ctrl+Space on Windows/Linux). In addition to classes, methods, and templates, command completion adds a list of context-relevant actions. You will find them in the list of regular completion. You can filter this list to commands only, using double dot (..). You can also type ”..” anywhere in your editor to see which commands are available in that context.\nCommand completion is a new and complementary way to work with IntelliJ IDEA, not a replacement for existing features. It combines the speed of shortcuts with the discoverability of Search Everywhere, in an easily accessible, context-aware experience. It helps you discover relevant, powerful features, in the context where you are working. We hope it feels like a natural extension of your existing workflow and helps you to be more productive.\nIn short: Command completion doesn’t replace existing features – it extends and complements them. \nWhy this matters\nIntelliJ IDEA is designed to keep you in the coding flow. Command completion helps with this by offering the following benefits:\nContext-awareness: Suggestions adapt to where you are in your code.\nCollaboration: Easier for experienced users to guide newcomers – just type “.change signature” – no shortcut knowledge required.\nConsistency: Works across different keymaps, OSes, and workflows.\nDiscoverability: See what actions are possible without leaving the editor.\nCommand completion allows you to think about what you want to achieve, instead of how to do so. This will also make pair programming easier, as you only need to describe what you want to do without having to interrupt your flow to find how to do it.  \nLooking ahead\nCommand completion is still in Beta in 2025.2, with improvements ongoing. At the moment, we have support for Java and Kotlin, as well as a few framework-specific actions that are also provided as intention actions, like Autowire Bean when you are using Spring Framework, or Extract JPQL Query for a Spring Data repository. \nMore actions, file types, and framework-specific commands will appear in future releases, not only for Spring, but also for Hibernate and other frameworks. For example, in the 2025.3 EAP, you can already navigate read-only files with .., Go to Declaration, or Go to Implementation – even in external libraries. Also in 2025.3 EAP, commands come with aliases, so you don’t have to remember the exact names. \nThe feature will be turned on by default in 2025.3, but there will be further improvements after that. We are also planning to add the option to add your own actions to command completion. Finally, we’re exploring integration with AI, so you could type things like “.suggest better name” or “.explain this”.\nInitial feedback\nWe very much appreciate your feedback and will be using it to guide the development process. So far, our first Beta users have indicated that the feature is promising. \nA lot of comments were provided under the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream where the command completion feature was introduced:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also received some direct feedback on LinkedIn and other Social Media: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out: Go to Settings, enable Command Completion, type . in the editor, and explore. You might discover powerful IDE features you never knew were there!\nPlease let us know what you think. We would love to hear how you are using command completion in your daily work and what we could add to make it even better. Thank you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the most recent JetBrains.NET Days Online 2025 event, Maarten Balliauw delivered a comprehensive session on migrating existing codebases to use C# nullable reference types, a feature that’s been available since C# 8 but remains underutilized in many legacy projects. Through practical examples and migration strategies, Maarten demonstrated how to bring null safety to your existing code without drowning in thousands of warnings.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\n#nullable enable – Unlock the Power of C# Nullability — Maarten Balliauw\nIt’s not for runtime safety\nMaarten opens with a crucial clarification that sets realistic expectations for the entire migration journey: “There is no runtime safety for nullable reference types. It is design time and compile time that help to check whether something can be null or not.” This isn’t a silver bullet that will eliminate all null reference exceptions – it’s a tool to help developers make better decisions while writing code.\nThe feature essentially flips the traditional C# paradigm. As Maarten explains, “The idea is that when you’re writing code, every single type that you have is going to be non-nullable by default. And there is a syntax to annotate a reference type as being nullable.” This inversion makes nullability explicit rather than implicit, forcing developers to think intentionally about null handling.\nThe Boy Scout Rule for migration\nWhen it comes to migrating existing codebases, Maarten advocates for a pragmatic approach. For smaller projects, you might enable nullability project-wide and plow through the warnings. But for larger codebases, he recommends the Boy Scout Rule: \n“Keep it disabled at the project level. And whenever you touch a piece of code, you enable it file by file and just work your way through until the entire project is converted.”\nThe key insight for where to begin? “Start at the center and work outwards” (29:59). Maarten suggests starting with classes that have few dependencies but are used extensively throughout the codebase, typically data transfer objects and domain models. A small change in these central classes can eliminate warnings across your entire codebase.\nThe temptation of the dammit operator\nThroughout the presentation, Maarten repeatedly warns against one particular anti-pattern: the null-forgiving operator (!), also known as the “dammit operator”. His stance is unequivocal: “The null forgiving operator is an anti-pattern.”\nWhy such strong language? “You’re lying to the compiler. You’re lying to yourself when you are working in this codebase a couple of months after you first wrote the code.” While the operator can be useful during migration to temporarily suppress warnings, Maarten emphasizes that production code should never ship with these suppressions.\nEmbracing null, not fighting it\nIn a refreshing perspective shift, Maarten reminds developers: “Don’t be afraid of null. Nullable reference types will help you get more confidence in compiler and IDE flow analysis. It’s impossible to get rid of all of the null usages in code” (37:23). The goal isn’t to eliminate null entirely, it’s to build a safety net for dealing with it effectively.\nThis philosophy extends to library authors, who need to consider consumers using different languages. Since nullable reference types are C# only, libraries should still include runtime null checks for robustness, especially when the API might be consumed by F# or VB.NET code that won’t benefit from the nullable annotations.\nEntity Framework’s surprise\nOne of the most valuable warnings in the presentation concerns Entity Framework Core, which has a potentially breaking behavior: “The Entity Framework Core team, unfortunately, did look at this, and they are actually updating your database schema based on nullable reference types.”\nThis means that enabling nullable reference types can inadvertently trigger database schema changes, something that might slip past developers but certainly won’t escape the notice of your DBA. It’s a “gotcha” that Maarten admits makes sense from Entity Framework’s perspective, but one that can be an unwelcome surprise during migration.\nPractical tools for the journey\nMaarten highlights several tools that make migration more manageable (38:28). The value tracking feature in Microsoft Visual Studio and Rider helps trace where properties are set, making it easier to determine if something can actually be null. The automatic migration tools can get you quite far along the way by running flow analysis and making educated guesses about nullability.\nFor JSON serialization scenarios, Maarten presents multiple strategies, with his personal favorite being the use of the required keyword combined with proper validation, rather than littering code with null-forgiving operators or losing type safety by making everything nullable.\nThe takeaway\nMaarten’s session demystifies the migration to nullable reference types, presenting it not as an all-or-nothing proposition but as a gradual improvement process. His closing summary captures the essence perfectly: “Nullable reference types give you design time and compile time safety in .NET, not at runtime.”\nThis session serves as both a technical guide and a philosophical framework for approaching nullability. It’s not about achieving perfection or eliminating all nulls – it’s about making your codebase more predictable, maintainable, and explicit about its null-handling intentions.\nFor teams sitting on legacy codebases wondering if the migration effort is worth it, the essence of Maarten’s argument is that the investment in nullable reference types pays dividends in code clarity, reduced bugs, and better communication of intent between team members, including your future self.\nFollow Maarten Balliauw’s work on nullable reference types and other C# topics on his blog, X, and Bluesky.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI Qith Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nThe Null-Forgiving Operator in C# Is a Code Smell(!)  by Matthew Champion.\nNullable reference types in C# – Migrating to nullable reference types by Maarten Balliauw. \nNullable reference types and nullability in EF Core by Damir Arh.\nNull & Void – Everything About Nothing in .NET – a presentation given by Stefan Pölz at .NET Days Online 2021.",

Recently, you’ve shared important feedback about AI usage limits, transparency, and the freedom to choose which AI providers you use. We heard you loud and clear.\nThat’s why we are working to introduce bring-your-own-key (BYOK) support for JetBrains AI Assistant and Junie. Simply put, BYOK will allow you to connect your personal accounts from OpenAI (or any compatible API) and Anthropic so you can use them directly in your JetBrains IDE. This feature will later be extended to work with Google Gemini, Azure, AWS Bedrock, and even self-hosted local models, and you will even be able to use it without a JetBrains AI subscription.\nWhy BYOK?\nWe understand that quotas can feel restrictive, and unclear usage policies can lead to frustration. With the BYOK feature, you will no longer be limited to JetBrains-managed quotas. Instead, you will use your own existing AI provider accounts, gaining clear visibility into your usage and costs directly from your provider.\nWhat will this mean for you?\nFreedom of choice: Pick your preferred AI model or provider. Whether it’s the latest cutting-edge model from Anthropic or Google, or a cost-efficient local model hosted on your own servers, you will decide what best suits your workflow.\n\n\n\n\nFull transparency: Clearly see how much each AI interaction costs in real time on your selected platform, without worrying about hidden quotas or unexpected interruptions.\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy and security: Your API keys will remain securely stored and managed on your own machine and will never be shared with JetBrains. Your data will stay between you and your chosen AI provider.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding an open ecosystem\nWith planned support for industry standards like the OpenAI API, ACP (Agent Client Protocol), Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol, and other common interfaces, JetBrains is committed to creating an open ecosystem. This approach means your IDE will become a hub that’s open to all current – and future – AI providers, without forcing vendor lock-in.\nWhat’s next?\nWe expect to add this feature by the end of the year, and this is just the beginning of our journey. We’re currently also working on expanding the range of supported AI providers, simplifying configurations, and refining features based on your feedback.\nWe’d love to hear your thoughts and learn which features you’d like us to prioritize next.

        "pubDate": "Mon, 03 Nov 2025 14:07:54 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "As we approach the release of IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3, we would like to share key information about changes that may impact your plugin development process. This post addresses common questions from the developer community and provides guidance on maintaining compatibility with the latest IntelliJ Platform versions.\nNo Immediate Upgrade Required\nIf you built your plugin against the IntelliJ Platform 2025.2 or earlier, it should remain compatible with 2025.3. You don’t need to rush to update right away.\nTip: Check compatibility locally by running the verifyPlugin Gradle task. This performs the same IntelliJ Plugin Verifier checks that are automatically run on JetBrains Marketplace when you upload plugin updates.\nThe IntelliJ Platform maintains strong backward compatibility, which generally preserves between minor versions. It means you can take your time testing and migrating your plugins.\nMajor Change: Unified Platform Distribution\nWhat’s Changing?\nStarting with version 2025.3, IntelliJ IDEA Community and Ultimate will be delivered as a unified platform. This marks a significant architectural change that makes plugin development and distribution easier. Read the full announcement: IntelliJ IDEA Moves to the Unified Distribution.\nStarting with 2025.1, PyCharm has undergone the same unification. Learn more in the PyCharm Unified blog post.\nNote: These updates only affect plugins targeting IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 and later. If your plugin still uses the IntelliJ Platform in version 2025.2 or earlier, no changes are needed at this time. References to IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate or Community for older versions continue working.\nKey Implications for Plugin Developers\nWith the unified distribution:\nIntelliJ IDEA Community Edition (IC) builds for 2025.3 and later are no longer available. Trying to resolve artifacts using IC-2025.3, IC-253.x.y, or the intellijIdeaCommunity() dependency helper will cause an error.\nFor version 2025.3 and future versions, you must target intellijIdea() as a platform artifact.\nWhen targeting PyCharm 2025.1 and above, use ⁠pycharm(version) instead of ⁠pycharmCommunity(version) and ⁠pycharmProfessional(version).\nThe unified distribution retains the same IU product code as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate.\nThe difference between Community and Ultimate now depends on licensing and feature access, not separate IDE distributions. All IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate plugins are included in the distribution but are disabled if there is no active subscription.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) is available in a unified distribution and does not require a subscription.\nDepending on Paid Functionality\nIf your plugin requires subscription-based features, you can explicitly depend on com.intellij.modules.ultimate. This module represents the licensing mechanism; when a user doesn’t have an active subscription, this module and all plugins that depend on it are disabled.\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.ultimate</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nWhat Does This Mean for Your Users?\nUsers upgrading from IntelliJ IDEA Community 2025.2  will be smoothly transitioned to the unified IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 as part of a regular version update. All plugins will continue working. \nThe free tier now offers additional features:\nBasic database functions (schema viewing, SQL completion).\nProject wizards for Spring Boot, Ktor, and other frameworks.\nBasic syntax highlighting for frameworks.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration (previously only available in IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate).\nRequirements\nTo work with version 2025.3, update the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\nplugins {\n  id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nWhen targeting 2025.3 for development, you must use the new ⁠intellijIdea() dependency helper—whether your plugin targets IntelliJ IDEA specifically or all other IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform.\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        // or intellijIdeaUltimate(\"2025.2\")\n\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n    }\n}\nWhen targeting PyCharm specifically, use the pycharm() dependency:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharmCommunity(\"2024.3\")\n        // or pycharmProfessional(\"2024.3\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        pycharm(\"2025.3\")\n    }\n}\nSee the Step-by-Step Migration Guide below for detailed instructions on updating your plugin.\nOpen Source and Custom IDEs\nFor developers building custom IDEs or using the open source version:\nThe open source code remains available on GitHub at JetBrains/intellij-community.\nGitHub Actions are now provided to simplify the process of building the IDE from source.\nPre-built open source versions can be found on GitHub Releases.\nThe open-source build utilizes the Community Edition (IC) product code and is compatible with all plugins that work with the Community Edition.\nCustom IDEs, like Android Studio, continue to function as before.\nKey API Changes in 2025.3\nModule Extraction and Explicit Dependencies\nSeveral modules have been separated from the core plugin into their own modules, each with its own individual classloader. While this does not affect binary compatibility, it is advisable to explicitly depend on the modules you need using bundledModule(moduleName):\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth.base\nintellij.platform.collaborationTools.auth\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.backend\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.protocolReaderRuntime\nintellij.platform.scriptDebugger.ui\nintellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\nintellij.platform.vcs.log\nintellij.platform.vcs.log.graph\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.log\")\n    }\n}\nIntelliLang Plugin Dependency Change\nIf your plugin relies on the org.intellij.intelliLang plugin, declare a dependency on the bundled module intellij.platform.langInjection:\n// When targeting 2025.2 and earlier:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdeaCommunity(\"2025.2\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"org.intellij.intelliLang\")\n    }\n}\n\n// When targeting 2025.3 and later:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.langInjection\")\n    }\n}\nStorage Annotation Restriction\nThe @Storage annotation can no longer be used at the top level. It must only be used within @State.storages.\n@Service\n@State(name = \"MySettings\", storages = [Storage(\"MySettings.xml\")])\nclass MySettings : PersistentStateComponent<MySettings> {\n\n  var myProperty = false\n\n  override fun getState() = this\n\n  override fun loadState(state: MySettings) = XmlSerializerUtil.copyBean(state, this)\n\n  companion object {\n    fun getInstance(): MySettings = service()\n  }\n}\nWhy Explicit Dependencies Matter\nDeclaring explicit dependencies on the plugins and modules your plugin uses is a best practice. It makes your plugin’s requirements clear to both the platform and other developers, ensures proper dependency loading order, and helps JetBrains Marketplace determine product compatibility.\nUnderstanding Dependencies: Gradle Build Script vs plugin.xml\nDependencies on plugins and modules defined in your Gradle build script, using the plugin(), bundledPlugin(), and bundledModule() dependency helpers, interact with the compilation classpath to ensure they are available during plugin development. However, to make them available at runtime for your plugin, it’s also required to define them in your plugin.xml file. See the Plugin Dependencies documentation for details.\nExample with plugin dependencies\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <depends>com.intellij.modules.platform</depends>\n    <depends>com.intellij.java</depends>\n    <depends>org.intellij.scala</depends>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nExample with plugin and bundled module dependencies\nIf your plugin depends on bundled modules, you must use the plugin model v2 dependencies definition, which requires the <dependencies> block with a clear separation between plugin and module dependencies.\nIn your build.gradle.kts:\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"2025.3\")\n        bundledPlugin(\"com.intellij.java\")\n        plugin(\"org.intellij.scala:2025.3.14\")\n        bundledModule(\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\")\n    }\n}\nIn your plugin.xml:\n<idea-plugin>\n    <!-- ... -->\n    <dependencies>\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.modules.platform\" />\n        <plugin id=\"com.intellij.java\" />\n        <plugin id=\"org.intellij.scala\" />\n        <module name=\"intellij.platform.vcs.dvcs\" />\n    </dependencies>\n    <!-- ... -->\n</idea-plugin>\nThis ensures that your plugin can compile with these dependencies during development and access them at runtime when users install it.\nStep-by-Step Migration Guide\nUpdate Your Gradle Plugin Version\nUpdate the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to the latest version, currently 2.10.4. Check the GitHub Releases page for updates or look for suggestions in logs when building the plugin.\n[org.jetbrains.intellij.platform] IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin is outdated: 2.10.0. Update `org.jetbrains.intellij.platform` to: 2.10.4\nTo update your setup to the latest version, simply increase the plugin version in the build.gradle.kts file or the ./gradle/libs.versions.toml if applicable.\nplugins {\n    id(\"org.jetbrains.intellij.platform\") version \"2.10.4\"\n}\nTesting Against 2025.3 Before Official Release\nEven if your plugin is designed for older versions of the IntelliJ Platform, it can still be used in future releases. To ensure compatibility with newer IDEs than the SDK you use, utilize the IntelliJ Plugin Verifier tool to check binary compatibility against other IntelliJ Platform versions.\nIn build.gradle.kts specify:\nintellijPlatform {\n   pluginVerification {\n        ides {\n            recommended()\n        }\n    }\n}\nNext, run the verifyPlugin Gradle task to perform the verification and identify any potential issues that require attention.\nIt is also possible to manually run a specific IDE with a different version than the one set for development, with your plugin loaded. To do this, register a new runEap Gradle task and execute it immediately afterward.\nval runEap by intellijPlatformTesting.runIde.registering {\n    type = IntelliJPlatformType.IntellijIdea\n    version = \"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\"\n    useInstaller = false\n}\nSwitching to 2025.3 for development\nImportant: The installer for IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 will only be available once 2025.3 is officially released. Until then, if you want to test your plugin against 2025.3 early, you have two options:\nUse a specific EAP release\nAll published JetBrains IDEs available for download are ready for use by all users and should also be used for plugin development to reflect our customers’ needs. To do this, you can simply add the IntelliJ Platform dependency using intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). However, if such a version is not yet available, you can refer to early access releases, which include their build numbers, available on the IntelliJ IDEA EAP download page or in a machine-readable JSON feed.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253.27864.23\")\n    }\n}\nUse snapshot versions\nJetBrains IDEs are also released as snapshots in the IntelliJ Platform Artifacts Repositories. To switch to these intermediate releases, you need to opt out of the installer artifacts and use a version specific to the IntelliJ Snapshots Maven Repository.\ndependencies {\n    intellijPlatform {\n        intellijIdea(\"253-EAP-SNAPSHOT\") {\n            useInstaller = false\n        }\n    }\n}\nOnce 2025.3 is officially released, simply use intellijIdea(\"2025.3\"). For more details, see the Target Versions documentation.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nDo I need to update my plugin immediately when 2025.3 is released?\nNo, plugins built for 2025.2 or older versions should still work with 2025.3.\nWhat if my plugin only supports versions earlier than 2025.3?\nNo changes needed. The older syntax (intellijIdeaCommunity(version), intellijIdeaUltimate(version), pycharmCommunity(version), and pycharmProfessional(version)) still works for older versions.\nWill my plugin work with both free-tier and paid subscription users?\nYes, using the intellijIdea(\"2025.3\") makes your plugin work for all users regardless of subscription status.\nDo I need to build multiple versions of my plugin for 2025.2 and 2025.3?\nNo. The platform type you specify in your build script is only used during plugin development. Your plugin.xml file contains the actual compatibility information through <depends> declarations and the since-build attribute. A single plugin build can work across multiple IDE versions.\nGradle fails with “Could not find idea:ideaIC:253.x.x”. What should I do?\nThis occurs because Community Edition builds are not available for versions 2025.3 and later. You have two options:\nUse an older version of IntelliJ IDEA Community for building, which will still make your plugin compatible with 2025.3.\nUpgrade the IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin to 2.10.4 and switch to intellijIdea(version).\nIf 2025.3 has not been released yet, you can use EAP by specifying a build number as the version.\nSet the version to 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT and set useInstaller = false.\nHow do I know which modules to include explicitly in dependencies?\nThe IntelliJ Plugin Verifier will report missing dependencies. Refer to the Key API Changes in 2025.3 section above.\nHow can I test against 2025.3 before the official release?\nUse specific EAP build numbers or snapshot versions, such as 253-EAP-SNAPSHOT, with useInstaller set to false. See Testing Against 2025.3 Before Official Release above.\nWhat versioning scheme should I use if I need separate builds for different versions?\nUse a SemVer-compatible scheme with suffixes, such as 1.2.3-251 for the 2025.1 version and 1.2.3-253 for the 2025.3 version. JetBrains Marketplace will automatically serve the correct version based on the user’s IDE version and your since-build and until-build attributes.\nConclusion\nThe IntelliJ Platform 2025.3 release introduces a unified IntelliJ IDEA distribution while maintaining strong backward compatibility. Plugins built for earlier IntelliJ Platform versions will still work with 2025.3, giving you time to migrate at your own pace.\nWhen you’re ready to target 2025.3, update to IntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin 2.10.4 or later and switch to the new intellijIdea() dependency helper. The platform APIs stay consistent across all license types, ensuring that your plugin works the same way for all users. Declare explicit dependencies on the modules you need, and use the verifyPlugin task to test compatibility before publishing.\nGot questions? Contact us on the JetBrains Platform Forum.

USB 색깔 규격이 모든 브랜드나 모든 기기에 걸쳐 아주 엄격하게 표준화되어 있는 것은 아니라는 사실이죠. 이론적으로는 어떤 제조업체가 USB 1.1 포트에 파란색을 사용할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 대부분의 잘 알려진 브랜드는 위에서 설명한 표준 색상 관례를 따르는 편이에요. 만약 확실하게 알고 싶다면, 사용하시는 기기의 설명서나 제조사 사양을 확인하는 것이 가장 정확합니다.\n이제는 스마트하게! 올바른 포트 사용 전략  \nUSB 포트 색깔이 의미하는 바를 제대로 이해하고 나니, 저의 기기 사용 습관도 완전히 바뀌었어요. 이전에는 그저 아무 데나 꽂았던 것을 이제는 각 기기에 가장 적합한 포트를 찾아 연결하기 시작한 거죠. 솔직히 말하면, 이 작은 변화가 가져온 효율성 향상에 정말 놀랐습니다.\n이제 제 스마트폰은 가능한 한 항상 빨간색이나 노란색 포트에 연결해서 충전합니다. 덕분에 배터리가 훨씬 빠르게 채워져서 더 이상 충전 때문에 애태우는 일이 없어요. 외장 하드 드라이브는 주저 없이 파란색이나 틸색 포트로 직행합니다. 덕분에 파일 백업이나 대용량 파일 전송이 예전보다 훨씬 빨라졌어요. 이전에 겪었던 긴 기다림은 이제 옛말이 되었죠. 키보드와 마우스 같은 경우는 검은색 USB 2.0 포트에도 충분히 잘 작동해서, 더 빠른 포트들은 정말 속도가 필요한 기기들을 위해 아껴둘 수 있게 되었습니다. 이렇게 전략적으로 사용하니, 괜히 느린 포트에 중요한 기기를 꽂아 시간을 낭비할 일이 없어져서 너무 좋아요!\n\n\nUSB-A 포트의 기능을 파악하는 데 색깔이 첫 번째 단서이긴 하지만, 그것이 전부는 아닙니다. 색깔 외에도 USB-A 포트에는 추가 정보를 제공하는 기호들이 종종 있어요. 예를 들어, 'SS' 또는 'SuperSpeed'라는 글자는 빠른 데이터 전송 기능을 의미하며, 때로는 'SS10'처럼 숫자가 함께 표시되어 10Gbps의 USB 3.1 Gen 2 속도를 나타내기도 합니다. 충전 전용 포트의 경우, 번개 모양이나 배터리 아이콘이 함께 표시되어 전력 출력만을 위한 포트임을 알려주기도 하니, 이런 작은 디테일에도 신경을 쓰는 것이 좋겠죠?\n이러한 USB 포트 색깔의 차이를 알게 되면서, 이제 제 기기들을 연결하는 행위는 단순한 습관이 아니라 의도적인 행동이 되었습니다. 이 지식은 단순히 PC를 사용할 때뿐만 아니라, 자동차, TV, 다른 여러 가전제품에 이르기까지 확장되어 모든 기기가 마땅히 받아야 할 최적의 전력과 속도를 누리게 해줍니다. 여러분도 오늘 알려드린 정보를 바탕으로 USB 포트를 더 스마트하게 사용하시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n✔️ USB 포트 색깔은 기능을 나타내는 비밀 코드: 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강/노랑, 하양 등 각 색깔은 데이터 전송 속도와 전력 공급량을 의미합니다.\n✔️ 잘못된 포트 사용은 성능 저하를 초래: 기기 특성에 맞지 않는 포트 사용 시 충전이 느려지거나 파일 전송 시간이 길어질 수 있습니다.\n✔️ 스마트한 매칭으로 효율 극대화: 스마트폰은 고출력(빨강/노랑), 외장하드는 고속(파랑/틸), 키보드/마우스는 표준(검정) 포트에 연결하세요.\n✔️ 색깔 외 추가 표식도 확인: 'SS', 'SuperSpeed' 문구나 번개/배터리 아이콘 등도 포트의 기능을 알려주는 중요한 단서입니다.\n이 정보를 통해 여러분의 디지털 라이프가 한층 더 편리해지기를 바랍니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\nA1: 일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\nQ2: 제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\nA2: 빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ3: USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\nA3: USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다. USB-C는 단자 모양이 동일하며, Thunderbolt 지원 여부나 USB Power Delivery (PD) 등의 추가 기능은 케이블이나 기기의 스펙을 통해 확인해야 합니다.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다.

Google AI Gemini와 Imagen이 탄생시킨 '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱으로 음식물 쓰레기는 줄이고, 요리의 즐거움은 키워보세요. 당신의 주방이 완전히 새로워집니다.\n\n\n매일 아침, 점심, 저녁. \"오늘 뭐 먹지?\"라는 질문은 우리 삶에서 영원히 끝나지 않을 숙제 같지 않나요? 냉장고 문을 열고 가득한 재료들을 보지만, 정작 뭘 해 먹어야 할지 막막했던 경험, 저만 그런 건 아닐 거예요. 결국 배달 앱을 켜면서 '아, 저 재료들 다 어떻게 하지…' 하고 죄책감을 느꼈던 순간들도 많았죠. 이런 우리 모두의 오래된 고민을 시원하게 해결해 줄 아주 특별한 주방 동반자가 드디어 세상에 나왔습니다. 바로 냉장고 사진 한 장으로 잠자고 있던 식재료에 새로운 생명을 불어넣어 주는 AI 요리 비서, '냉장고 속을 부탁해' 앱입니다.\n솔직히 말하면, 처음 이 아이디어가 생각났을때 '진짜 가능할까?' 하고 반신반의했어요. 하지만 Google의 개발자 지원 프로그램인 'Build with Google AI (바이브코딩)'를 통해 이 놀라운 아이디어가 현실이 되었답니다. 개발자들은 Google AI Studio라는 정말 강력한 웹 기반 도구를 활용해서, 최첨단 AI 모델인 Gemini와 Imagen을 손쉽게 테스트하고 앱에 빠르게 통합할 수 있었죠. 덕분에 복잡하고 어려운 AI 기술이 이제 우리 주방 안으로 쏙 들어와서, 요리 경험 자체를 완전히 바꿔놓을 준비를 마쳤습니다. 2025년, 이제 '오늘 뭐 먹지?' 고민은 이 앱에게 맡겨도 될 것 같아요.\n오늘은 이 혁신적인 앱이 어떻게 우리의 식생활을 혁신하는지, 그 심층적인 기능과 사용법을 저와 함께 자세히 파헤쳐 볼까 합니다. 기대되지 않으세요?\n  '냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 핵심 기능 Deep Dive\n이 앱이 시중에 나와 있는 수많은 레시피 앱들과 차원이 다르다고 자신 있게 말할 수 있는 이유는 바로 AI 기술이 접목된 네 가지 강력한 차별점 때문입니다. 단순히 레시피를 찾아주는 것을 넘어, 요리의 전 과정을 스마트하게 도와주는 진정한 파트너라고 할 수 있죠.\n\n\n① 눈으로 보고 '이해'하는 AI, Gemini\n'냉장고 속을 부탁해'의 가장 핵심적인 강점은 단연 Google의 막강한 멀티모달 AI, Gemini에 있습니다. 사용자가 냉장고 사진을 업로드하면, Gemini는 단순하게 이미지 속에서 형태만 인식하는 것을 넘어, 사진 속 식재료 하나하나를 마치 사람처럼 '이해'하기 시작합니다. 음… 예를 들면, 어지럽게 놓인 채소 더미, 누가 봐도 반쯤 사용한 소스병, 심지어 우유팩의 브랜드까지 식별해서 정확한 재료 목록을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 만들어내죠.\n제가 직접 테스트해 봤는데, 정말 놀랍더군요. 단순히 '채소'라고 인식하는 게 아니라 '시들기 시작한 상추', '반 개 남은 양파' 이런 식으로 상태까지 추론하더라고요! 이게 단순히 재료를 나열하는 것을 넘어서, 각 재료의 신선도나 현재 상태까지 고려해서 가장 최적의, 그리고 창의적인 레시피를 제안하는 기반이 됩니다. 이 부분이 정말 중요한데, 음식물 쓰레기를 줄이는 데 크게 기여할 수 있겠다는 생각이 들었어요.\n② 상상력을 현실로, Imagen으로 보는 완성 요리\n\"이 레시피, 과연 맛있어 보일까?\" 요리 초보자든 베테랑이든, 이 질문은 요리에 대한 동기를 부여하는 아주 중요한 요소일 겁니다. 솔직히 글로만 된 레시피로는 감이 잘 안 올 때가 많잖아요? '냉장고 속을 부탁해'는 이 점을 정확히 꿰뚫고 있었어요.\n레시피 카드 우측 상단의 작은 카메라 아이콘을 한번 눌러보세요. 그러면 Google의 최첨단 이미지 생성 모델인 Imagen이 마법을 부리기 시작합니다. 레시피의 이름과 상세한 설명을 바탕으로, 마치 전문 푸드 포토그래퍼가 갓 촬영한 듯한 먹음직스러운 완성 요리 이미지를 그 자리에서 바로 생성해 줍니다. 정말 감탄이 나오지 않을 수 없죠. 이건 그냥 보기 좋은 것을 넘어, 요리에 대한 영감을 제대로 불어넣어 주고, 어떤 그릇에 어떻게 담아야 할지 플레이팅 아이디어까지 제공해서 요리의 즐거움을 한층 더 끌어올려 줍니다. 제 생각엔 이 기능 하나만으로도 이 앱을 써볼 가치가 충분하다고 느껴졌어요.\n③ 나만의 맞춤형 셰프, 이제 당신의 취향을 말해보세요\nAI는 식별된 재료를 가장 효율적이고 맛있게 사용할 수 있는 레시피를 먼저 똑똑하게 추천합니다. 그런데 여기서 끝이 아니에요. 이건 정말 '개인 맞춤형 셰프'가 아닐까 싶을 정도로 디테일한 설정이 가능해요. 사용자는 '한식', '이탈리안', '퓨전' 등 원하는 요리 스타일을 선택할 수 있고요, 심지어 '채식', '글루텐 프리', '저탄수화물' 같은 특정 식단 필터를 적용해서 수많은 레시피 중에서 내 상황과 입맛에 정말 꼭! 맞는 '오늘의 메뉴'를 발견할 수 있습니다.\n냉장고 한 켠에서 잊고 있던 자투리 재료들 있잖아요? 이걸 어떻게 활용해야 할지 몰라 버리곤 했는데, 이제 AI가 그걸 기가 막히게 조합해서 창의적인 방법들을 제안해 줍니다. 아, 생각만 해도 뭔가 뿌듯하고 재미있지 않나요? 이건 요리 이상의 경험을 제공해 주는 것 같아요.\n④ 요리의 흐름을 돕는 스마트 기능들: 양손은 자유롭게, 장보기는 스마트하게\n요리하다 보면 양념 묻은 손으로 스마트폰 화면을 터치하느라 고생했던 경험, 다들 있으시죠? 저도 손에 밀가루 범벅인 채로 레시피 다음 단계를 넘기려다 포기한 적이 한두 번이 아니에요.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 지금까지 290개가 넘는 스타트업에 투자했다. 초기 VC가 대부분 비슷할 텐데, 이 중 75% 이상은 평생 엑싯도 못하고 그냥 언젠가는 없어질 테고, 나머지 25%에서 승부가 난다. 이 25% 중에서도 극소수만 엄청 잘 되고, 나머지는 그냥 평타를 치거나, 아니면 회사는 잘 먹고 잘사는 라이프스타일 사업이 되지만, 이런 회사는 우리 같이 수십 배의 수익을 바라보고 투자하는 VC에겐 썩 좋은 결과를 가져오진 않는다.\n뭐, 그렇다고 우리가 투자하는 회사마다 별로라는 건 아니다. 좋은 성장을 하고 있는 회사도 많고, 꽤 많은 회사가 그들이 사업을 하는 분야에서는 고객이 가장 먼저, 또는 두 번째로 떠올리는 “top of the mind” 브랜드가 됐거나 되고 있는데, 이 과정을 옆에서 꽤 가까운 곳에서 본다는 건 초기 투자자만이 가질 수 있는 특권이자 자랑이다. 이 중엔 당근, 핀다, 클래스101과 같이 상당히 큰 시장에서 누구나 다 아는 브랜드가 된 투자사도 있지만, 일반인들에겐 상대적으로 낯선 시장에서, 그 시장에 종사하는 관계자라면 누구나 다 아는 브랜드가 된 투자사도 있다.\n이건 내가 말한 게 아니라 작년에 다른 분에게 들은 건데, 스트롱 투자사들은 겉으로는 요란하진 않지만, 안으로는 아주 고요하게 성장하는 회사들이 많아서 좋다는 말이었다. 즉, 본인이 지금까지 수많은 스타트업과 대표들을 봐왔는데, 소셜미디어에서 정말 요란하게 사업하고 투자 많이 받았다고 자랑하는 회사들은 결국엔 큰 사업으로 성장하지 못하지만, 오히려 조용히 좋은 제품과 매출을 만들면서 고요하게 성장하는, 한 번도 들어보지 못한 회사들이 크게 성장하는 경우가 많다고 한다. 실제로 스트롱 투자사들이 그런진 나도 잘 모르겠지만, 대부분 돈도 없고 사람도 없어서 조용히 사업에만 집중하는 건 맞는 것 같다.\n최근에 후속 투자를 유치하는 우리 투자사를 오랜만에 만났는데, 위에서 말한, 작년에 들었던 고요한 성장이라는 말이 생각났다. 대표님이 매달 이메일로 보내주는 업데이트는 잘 읽고 있지만, 직접 만나서 그동안의 사업 경과, 지표, 그리고 앞으로의 계획에 대해서 꽤 오랫동안 이야기한 건 정말 오랜만이었고, 상당히 인상 깊었던 미팅이었다. 고요한 성장을 하고 있는 딱 그런 회사였기 때문이다.\n일단 이 회사가 사업하는 분야는 대부분의 투자자나 일반인들은 잘 모르는 산업이다. 우리도 처음 만났을 때, “와, 한국에도 이런 시장이 있구나.”라는 생각을 할 정도로 잘 안 알려진 시장이었다. 그런데 이렇게 잘 안 알려진 시장이라고 하면, 대부분 아주 작은 틈새시장을 떠올리는데, 이 시장은 전혀 작지 않은, 전 세계적으로 수십조 원 되는, 아무도 모르지만, 아는 사람만 아는 엄청나게 큰 틈새시장이다.\n이 시장에서 우리 투자사는 수년 동안 진흙탕에서 굴렀고, 그동안 솔직히 망할 뻔한 순간도 몇 번 있었다. 하지만, 그때마다 회사는 절대로 죽지 않고 매번 더 강하게 살아남는 바퀴벌레처럼 버티고 또 버텼다. 그러면서 그 분야에서 계속 자기만의 영토를 야금야금 만들었고, 자신의 브랜드도 조금씩 만들기 시작했다. 다른 회사들이 투자자들의 돈으로 요란하게 사업하고 있을 때, 이 회사는 아주 조용히 제품을 만들었고, 고객을 확보했고, 매출을 만들었고, 심지어 수출까지 시작했다.\n나는 이렇게 묵묵히 자기 할 일만 하면서 요란하지 않고 고요하게 성장하는 회사들이 제일 좋다.",
