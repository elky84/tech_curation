        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re exploring Meta’s Federation Platform, a scalable set of tools for managing compliance-related tasks, along with Privacy Waves, our method for batching these tasks and ensuring accountability. \nTogether, the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves create a structured, effective, and sustainable approach to operationalizing privacy work, enabling Meta to safeguard user data for the billions of people that use our products.\nGiven its success in the privacy domain, we’re expanding this approach to other domains such as security and accessibility.\nAt Meta, we take a systematic approach to privacy-related compliance. Experts decode complex obligations into actionable product requirements, ensuring coverage and consistency across all Meta products. We then deploy technical solutions that address these requirements at scale through our Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) initiative. Following that, our privacy teams centrally automate remediation of potential issues; and finally, if expert help is needed, they send tasks to product teams for distributed execution.\nOperationalizing this work at Meta’s scale – across tens of thousands of engineers and numerous products – requires robust coordination. To facilitate this, we developed the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves program:\nThe Federation Platform breaks down large compliance-related initiatives into smaller, manageable workstreams. It distributes tasks to the appropriate teams and enables them to track progress through to completion.\nThe Privacy Waves program organizes tasks for these initiatives into monthly batches, creating a predictable cadence that improves quality and accountability of task distribution and management. It helps teams plan and execute their compliance-related work systematically, rather than reactively. \nTogether, the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves program play a critical role in safeguarding user data and ensuring consistent, effective operations of our systems and solutions, supporting Meta’s compliance posture (for both existing and future obligations) while balancing internal engineering efficiency and experience. \nThey are significant levers in Meta’s compliance-related efforts, managing over 100,000 tasks annually within established timelines. Internal surveys reveal significantly higher positive sentiment for Privacy Waves tasks compared to ad-hoc tasks. And we estimate that the program has saved hundreds of thousands of engineering hours by enhancing strategy, tooling, and task quality. The success of this approach in the privacy domain has encouraged its expansion into other domains such as security, accessibility and our broader compliance efforts.\nThe need for a centralized work distribution and management system\nThere are several reasons why large organizations like Meta benefit from a centralized system to distribute and manage compliance-related work:\nMeeting privacy obligations at scale is complex because it often requires thousands of engineers to each complete small, specialized tasks across hundreds of global pressures and thematic areas.\nScalability and internal accountability are crucial. Doing this ad hoc can lead to task fatigue, difficulty meeting completion expectations, and diminished developer sentiment. Without centralized management and oversight, it becomes challenging to effectively prioritize, track, and execute work across organizational boundaries, or to deduplicate tasks across teams.\nDeveloper experience matters and can even increase output. A positive, well-managed task flow reduces operational burden, maintains morale, and sustains high productivity. \nExternal accountability is essential to operations. Meta must demonstrate consistent and effective operations to regulators and auditors. The Federation Platform enables clear, standardized practices along with consistent documentation and validation to uphold Meta’s compliance posture in response to external requirements.\nManaging privacy work with the Federation Platform\nWorkstream configuration: How engineers integrate with the platform\n\nImplementing a workstream on the Federation Platform requires defining in-code logic that mirrors the typical lifecycle of a potential privacy issue. This involves specifying how to detect, distribute, remediate, and verify resolution of these issues, ensuring their effective management. The resulting technical workstream configuration (code file) includes methods for:\nScraping flags: Scraping involves identifying the relevant set of privacy flags –  indications of potential issues that require attention. These flags are ingested into the Federation Platform based on the workstream’s configuration, which often leverages Meta’s reusable detection and verification frameworks. The scraping process can be automated to run daily using in-code methods or ad-hoc via the platform’s intake APIs. Scraping defines the scope of the workstream, with additional filters and linters configured as needed.\nOwnership resolution: This involves implementing logic to determine the ownership of privacy flags. Typically, this requires referencing Meta’s central catalog to map relevant assets, such as code files and data tables, to their respective owners.\nGrouping: Workstreams can optionally group related flags, such as those with a common owner or located in the same directory. This allows for efficient bulk remediation by bundling these flags into a single task or diff (code change).\nActioning (Task/Diff): Workstreams decide how to address each privacy flag or group of flags. The most common approach is to file a task, which is then assigned to the asset owner. Alternatively, they can choose to send automated code changes to directly resolve issues, which must be reviewed by the asset owner.\nTask content and distribution: Workstreams configure the content of tasks, providing context on why the task is necessary, its alignment with privacy initiatives, and instructions and workflows to fix the issue. Workstreams also configure how they want to distribute their tasks, which is most commonly done through the Privacy Waves program.\nResolution logic: Finally, workstreams define resolution logic to determine when a privacy flag is resolved. This allows the Federation Platform to automatically close tasks once the underlying issue is fixed or reopen tasks if they are prematurely closed.\nThe general-purpose configuration described above is versatile and extends well beyond privacy use cases. For instance, security and accessibility workstreams have started utilizing it to address potential vulnerabilities and product accessibility matters through task distribution. Similarly, engineering excellence initiatives operate workstreams to drive API migrations, code quality improvements, and the cleanup of obsolete experiments across numerous teams. This positions the Federation Platform as a powerful tool for driving diverse, large scale initiatives across the organization.\nIn addition to the technical configuration steps outlined above, privacy workstreams strive to adhere to the comprehensive end-to-end federation process detailed below, ensuring a holistic approach to managing privacy issues.\nAn overview of the end-to-end federation process\nStep 1: High-level strategy and planning\nBefore distributing work, a thorough review process evaluates the holistic strategy for a privacy area to ensure their plan efficiently meets applicable privacy-related obligations. This strategy often involves a combination of developing privacy aware infrastructure and controls through traditional project work, privacy teams centralizing bulk remediation via scripts and mass code changes, and – when automated solutions are not feasible – distributing work across the company via Federation Platform workstreams and Privacy Waves.\nProduct organizations (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) receive advanced visibility into upcoming privacy work, allowing them to incorporate it into their roadmaps and commit to its delivery. While aligning work across organizational lines takes longer, it ultimately enables easier and more efficient completion of tasks.\nStep 2: Configuring efficient task experiences\nTasks for Federation Platform workstreams that participate in Privacy Waves must clearly communicate the nature of the work, due dates, link to relevant context and documentation, and contain the necessary steps for resolution. Structured tasks guide users through a wizard-like workflow with multiple-choice questions, often culminating in automated remediations (e.g., code changes, click-to-fix tools) based on user decisions. These ‘wizards’ facilitate appropriate decision-making by product engineers and, in some cases, have been shown to reduce the effort required to complete tasks by around 50%.\nTasks are enriched with links to support forums and similar tasks where assistance can be sought, if needed. AI-powered support agents are embedded within tasks which help task owners search through relevant resources and write code quickly, which requires human review before landing.\nStep 3: Reviewing and improving task quality\nA review committee provides feedback on task quality and content for workstreams participating in Privacy Waves, identifying areas for improvement and opportunities for automation. Automated health signals for each workstream, such as completion rates, open tasks, deferral rates, and developer friction (e.g., broken tooling, inadequate support), are measured and tracked. Workstreams and their reviewers monitor these metrics monthly and are held accountable for improvements.\nEngineering sentiment is captured for each workstream through task owner surveys, and AI is used to summarize their feedback, enabling workstream owners to learn from task owner input and enhance future tasks. These features contribute to improved work quality, developer sentiment, and completion rates.\nStep 4: Distributing the work\nLinting tools are employed to prevent the distribution of low-quality and low-risk work (e.g., for assets queued for deletion or lacking any data). Workstreams can configure the lints they wish to apply.\nTasks are sent in Privacy Waves, which are batches of privacy-related work distributed at a predefined, predictable cadence. Privacy Waves streamline execution, coordination, and reporting, since all tasks in a wave share the same deadline, allowing for timely reminders.\nA sophisticated matching algorithm aligns tasks with teams based on competing priorities related to assets they own. Combined with predictable task distribution, this approach ensures timely work assignment and enables teams to effectively prioritize, allowing them to balance responsibilities and make consistent progress towards addressing their workloads.\nStep 5: Ensuring accountability of execution\nTo ensure timely completion of tasks, deadlines are established with an aim at preventing deferral beyond these critical dates. Automated nudges and escalations are strategically used to remind individuals and teams to complete work on schedule, minimizing unnecessary noise and highlighting overdue tasks that require immediate attention.\nFurthermore, completion rates for privacy work are rigorously measured and reported at all organizational levels, fostering a culture of accountability from frontline teams to leadership. This transparent approach ensures that everyone is held responsible for executing their tasks in a timely manner, promoting a sense of ownership and urgency across the organization.\nStep 6: Reporting and recognition\nThe centralized distribution of tasks via Federation Platform and Privacy Waves streamline operational effectiveness and verification. These systems document completed tasks in a standardized format that aligns with expectations, providing clear and consistent evidence that supports Meta’s compliance posture in response to external requirements.\nAt Meta, executing on compliance-related work is an integral part of internal engineering expectations. To ensure that individuals receive the recognition they deserve, centralized recognition tooling is utilized to credit their contributions in performance evaluations. This approach not only motivates engineers to prioritize these efforts, but also reinforces the importance of this critical work in maintaining user trust and our compliance posture.\nExpansions for the Federation Platform and Waves\nAs Meta continues to evolve, the Federation Platform and Waves programs are actively being expanded into new domains like security, accessibility, and broader compliance-related efforts. This expansion presents unique challenges, including different types of tasks, complex multi-step remediation processes, varying deadlines, and more. However, our foundational principles of centralized task distribution, execution tracking, and accountability provide a robust framework to address these challenges effectively.\n\nTo ensure seamless extension into new areas, we’ll refine our tooling and processes, developing solutions that cater to each domain’s specific needs while maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency. By doing so, we aim to exceed expectations, reinforcing our commitment to safeguarding user data and ensuring efficient and consistent operations across all areas. This forward-looking approach underscores Meta’s dedication to innovation in compliance standardization, setting a benchmark for other tech companies to follow.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to express our gratitude to reviewers of this post, including (in last name alphabetical order): Chris Adams, Bob Baldwin, Denys Besedynskyy, Herb David, Dylan Drop, Katriel Cohn-Gordon, Xenia Habekoss, Mohit Jha, Ryan Pratt, Matt Pregozen, Jessica Retka, Thomas Richards, and Chris Wiltz, many of whom have made significant contributions to Federation Platform and Privacy Waves.\nAdditionally, we would also like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees, who have played a crucial role in developing and maturing Federation Platform and Privacy Waves over the years.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The state of the research\nDiff Risk Score (DRS) is an AI-powered technology built at Meta that predicts the likelihood of a code change causing a production incident, also known as a SEV. Built on a fine-tuned Llama LLM, DRS evaluates code changes and metadata to produce a risk score and highlight potentially risky code snippets. Today, DRS powers many risk-aware features that optimize product quality, developer productivity, and computational capacity efficiency. Notably, DRS has helped us eliminate major code freezes, letting developers ship code when they historically could not with minimal impact to customer experience and the business.\nWhy it matters\nSoftware development is fraught with risk, especially for intricate, rapidly evolving, and scaled products and technologies. Because Meta operates at a global scale, we need the best tools possible to mitigate risk and to protect both user experience and advertiser outcomes.\nAI is transforming how we build products, so we committed ourselves to applying AI to improve every aspect of the software development process. Production risk was one of the areas we tackled first. We theorized that, if equipped with a model that could predict if a code change might cause a SEV, we could build features and workflows to improve almost every aspect of writing and pushing code.\nSince DRS use cases are too numerous to cover in depth here, we’ll focus on one: code unfreeze. For Meta, production incidents can drive significant negative user experience and advertiser impact. For this reason, some teams have historically “frozen” major parts of the codebase for sensitive periods like Cyber 5 holiday shopping week, preventing engineers from shipping code to reduce incident risk. For certain teams, it has cut down their holiday shopping code freeze, leading to significant improvements in productivity.\nWhile this had clear reliability benefits, the tradeoff was a substantial reduction in productivity. DRS enabled a more nuanced approach, letting developers land lower-risk changes during these periods while minimizing production incidents, thus protecting the user experience, the business, and productivity. In fact, DRS has driven meaningful productivity gains across many sensitive periods. During one such period, a major partner event in 2024, we landed 10,000+ code changes (that previously could not have landed during a freeze) with minimal production impact, enabling continued innovation and customer success. What’s more, by managing productivity and risk in this way, we benefit twice: through more code landed and through less engineering time spent detecting, understanding, and mitigating production incidents.\nCode unfreeze works well, but it’s just the start of what the technology can do. Understanding risk, even imperfectly and at a statistical level, has driven improvements for Meta in more ways than we anticipated – there are 19 use cases for risk tooling and growing!\nWhere we’re headed next\nThe success of DRS has spurred the creation of new risk-aware features across Meta that span the entire development lifecycle, from planning to post-release monitoring. The demand to build such features also led us to build the Risk Awareness Platform to provide risk analysis APIs and tool integrations.\nWe envision four major directions for risk awareness in the coming months and years.\nFirst, while we’ve seen an explosion of DRS-powered features on the Risk Awareness Platform, from optimizing build and test selection to improving reliability, selecting code reviewers, and analyzing release risks, we believe this is only the beginning. A critical problem in software engineering is maximizing innovation rate subject to a reliability threshold, so the applications of risk understanding are virtually inexhaustible. We believe code risk can play a significant role in improving this tradeoff, so we will build more risk-aware features while improving their quality. As the risk model, feature data, and user experiences improve, we’ll see greater real-world benefits for people who use Meta’s products and businesses who advertise with Meta.\nSecond, we will expand beyond code change risk to configuration change risk. While code changes cause the plurality of SEVs at Meta, configuration changes are another large category. For this reason, we’ve expanded the RAP to include models that predict the risk of various config changes. These efforts are state of the art, focused on an open research area, and earlier on the research-to-production continuum, but we believe they will soon power feature families of their own, much like DRS does today.\nThird, we want to automate the risk mitigation step. Instead of flagging risky diffs and recommending appropriate reviewers or rollback mechanisms, we want to use AI agents to proactively generate risk-mitigating changes. This can be done for code in motion (i.e. diffs or pull requests) and for code at rest to lower baseline codebase risk. Additionally, once we are armed with a greater understanding of configuration risks, these agents will be able to operate flexibly across both code and config changes.\nFourth, we will increasingly use natural language outputs to show humans what these risk-aware technologies are doing and why. By helping engineers understand the rationale behind the risk score, we’ll empower them to either mitigate risks or give the model feedback to improve accuracy. This creates a learning loop for improving both our risk models and the end user experience. LLM explainability remains an open area of research, but our teams are actively working to offer answers to common questions.\nWe are excited for the future of risk-aware software development, and we look forward to learning from—and with—our colleagues in industry as we make progress in this valuable domain.\nRead the papers\n\n“Moving Faster and Reducing Risk: Using LLMs in Release Deployment“\n“Leveraging Risk Models to Improve Productivity for Effective Code Un-Freeze at Scale”\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank all the team members and the leadership that contributed to making the DRS effort successful at Meta.

This major change allows you to use kotlinx.rpc without kotlinx.serialiation in a gRPC setup. The responsibility for serializing data is now handled by the implementer of the RpcClient and RpcServer interfaces. See the incompatible API changes guide for more information.\nSimplified lifetime management\nWe’ve simplified resource management and reduced the potential for common mistakes. The @Rpc generated implementations, RpcClient, and RpcServer, no longer extend CoroutineScope. Consequently, the CoroutineScope parameter has been removed from the RpcServer.registerService factory method, streamlining the overall API.\nStrict mode is now the default\nStrict mode, which was introduced in version 0.5.0 to simplify the APIs and guarantee correctness, is now enabled by default, and it cannot be disabled in versions after 0.8.0.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Integrate Qodana into TeamCity\n\n\n\nThere are many compelling reasons to use TeamCity as your CI server. Thanks to its out-of-the-box features, smart test management capabilities, and great scalability for enterprises, TeamCity offers a robust and reliable CI solution. But if you’re really looking to increase compliance and improve code quality and security, you can couple it with Qodana. \nIntegrating Qodana’s static code analysis can significantly improve the quality of your codebase and help you enforce better standards in your CI/CD pipeline. With built-in support through a dedicated Qodana build runner, it’s becoming increasingly easy to embed code quality checks directly into your development workflow.\nIn this post, we’ll explore how Qodana and TeamCity complement each other and how to get started with your integration process.\nTable of Contents\n\nBringing Qodana into TeamCity\nConfiguring Qodana in your build pipeline\nQuality gates and baseline comparisons\nCustom configuration with scripts\nViewing results in TeamCity or Qodana Cloud\nSupporting pull requests and branch analysis\nTeamCity Cloud and Qodana Cloud for better quality software products\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I use Qodana to analyze .NET projects?\nWhy is TeamCity often used with Qodana instead of other analyzers?\nWhere can I get assistance if I have an issue? \n\n\nBringing Qodana into TeamCity\nQodana is available as a build runner within TeamCity, making it simple to incorporate static analysis into your existing builds. To get started, make sure that your project is built using a language supported by Qodana, such as Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, or C#. \nQodana is compatible with various IDEs and any CI pipeline, including all JetBrains IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Rider), VS Code, and Visual Studio, as well as platforms like Jenkins and .NET. You can find a list of Qodana linters here.\nIf you’re running your own TeamCity agents, ensure that Docker is installed and accessible. For users of TeamCity Cloud with JetBrains-hosted agents, this is already set up for you.\nIt’s worth noting that Qodana doesn’t currently support Windows-based build agents in TeamCity.\nConfiguring Qodana in your build pipeline\nSetting up Qodana in TeamCity is easy.\nWhile the recommended and most straightforward approach is to place your `qodana.yaml` configuration file directly in the repository, Qodana also supports dynamic configuration through TeamCity’s command-line runner. This can be helpful in edge cases, for example, if your team needs to tailor inspections dynamically based on project type, team preferences, or environment.\nThat said, for most teams, using a versioned `qodana.yaml` file ensures consistency, clarity, and traceability across builds.\nTo learn how to set up dynamic configuration in TeamCity, view our response to this query. \nPrefer something more visual? Explore Qodana’s code coverage reports in the TeamCity UI – no scripting required.\nStep 1: In TeamCity, go to the configuration page of your build and add a new build step. \nStep 2: Select the Qodana build runner, and then expand the advanced options to customize its behavior.\nStep 3: Define the linter you’d like to use, specify a version, and point to either a default or custom inspection profile. If you’re using Qodana Cloud, you can also add a project token at this stage. This is required for commercial linters, but optional for community ones.\nbuildType {\n    steps {\n        qodana {\n            name = \"Qodana analysis\"\n            linter = jvm {\n                version = Qodana.JVMVersion.LATEST\n            }\n            inspectionProfile = embedded {\n                name = \"qodana.starter\"\n            }\n            cloudToken = \"%qodana.cloud.token%\"\n            additionalQodanaArguments = \"--baseline qodana.sarif.json\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOptional step: For more granular control, you can configure things like a unique report ID, working directory, or whether Qodana reports should be visible under the Tests tab in TeamCity. There’s also support for advanced parameters, such as Docker arguments or additional Qodana CLI options.\nFor more detailed instructions and more on the function of each step, view the docs. \nConfigure Qodana in TeamCity\n\n\n\n\nQuality gates and baseline comparisons\nQuality gates are tools that let you stop code from being merged to the main branch if it doesn’t meet specific requirements, or if too severe or too many issues are flagged. If a quality gate condition fails, Qodana terminates using exit code 255, which makes a CI/CD workflow or pipeline fail. \nQodana makes it easy to set up quality gates that fail a build when the number of issues exceeds a set threshold. It also supports baseline functionality, which allows you to compare the current analysis results with a previous state. This helps identify new problems instead of flagging the same issues with every analysis.\nBoth of these features are configured using simple command-line arguments in the Qodana runner. There are various ways you can set this up. For example, you can create a quality gate that considers the number of problems before allowing code to be merged (more flexible settings are available in `qodana.yaml`):\nfailureConditions:\n  severityThresholds:\n    any: 10 # Total problems\n    critical: 5 # Critical and other severities\n    high: 5\n    moderate: 10\n    low: 20\n    info: 20\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of quality gates and baseline functionality can help your team avoid a crisis as well as unnecessary noise from legacy issues.\nSet Up Quality Gates\nCustom configuration with scripts\nIf your project requires a custom inspection profile or specific exclusions, you can use a `qodana.yaml` file. You can either include this file in your repository or use a script in TeamCity to generate it on the fly.\n\n\n\n\nView Configuration Docs\nViewing results in TeamCity or Qodana Cloud\nOnce your build runs, Qodana offers flexible options for reviewing results. You can access detailed analysis directly in the Qodana tab within TeamCity, making it easy to spot issues alongside your other build diagnostics.\nAlternatively, you can explore the results in Qodana Cloud, which provides a web-based dashboard with collaboration tools, history tracking, and integration with issue trackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting pull requests and branch analysis\nQodana also works well in pull request workflows. The purpose of pull request analysis is to examine code changes in a pull request or merge request, detecting issues introduced or fixed by that specific change.\nQodana compares the current branch against the target branch (e.g. `main` or `develop`), and then it highlights issues only in the changed files or lines.\nBy configuring VCS triggers in TeamCity, you can analyze merge requests or specific branches before they’re integrated into your main codebase. This adds an essential layer of quality assurance to every code review.\nThen baseline track new problems introduced over time by comparing the current analysis results with a previous “clean” state.\nYou can generate a baseline file, and in future runs, Qodana compares the current issues against this baseline. Only new issues (not present in the baseline) are reported as problems.\nThese approaches can be combined for better quality gates and enforcement.\nTeamCity Cloud and Qodana Cloud for better quality software products\nIntegrating Qodana into your TeamCity pipeline gives you a solid foundation for a healthier codebase. With static analysis running automatically as part of your build process, you reduce the chance of bugs slipping through and can use Qodana to enforce quality as a team.\nTeamCity and Qodana compliment each other, with TeamCity managing your builds with Qodana ensuring that your code is clean and something you can be proud of. Both help prevent future issues, and together, they offer an automated, and scalable approach to CI/CD – with built-in code quality from day one.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I use Qodana to analyze .NET projects?\nTo analyze .NET projects, you can use the `qodana-dotnet` Docker image or the native solution based on Rider. There’s also a Community Edition available via the `qodana-cdnet` Docker image, but it’s better to use the trial version of a paid license for greater functionality.\nWhy is TeamCity often used with Qodana instead of other analyzers?\nTeamCity and Qodana are both created by JetBrains, which means deep integration that’s not easily reproduced by competitors. \nWhere can I get assistance if I have an issue? \nYou can visit this TeamCity Support page or email Qodana Support.\nDon’t have TeamCity?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we are committed to delivering the best technologies to professional developers. We support multiple LLM providers across our AI products to ensure you have access to the right tools for your needs and the freedom to choose the ones you prefer.\nToday, we’re excited to announce that the latest model from OpenAI, GPT-5, is now available in our AI products: AI Assistant, Junie, and Kineto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA leap forward in developer AI\nIn one of the most exciting recent developments in AI news, OpenAI has just revealed the new GPT-5 model. At JetBrains, we had the opportunity to access and test GPT-5 early. \n“Iterative deployment helps ensure we approach and launch new model capabilities with the highest levels of rigor. Working with JetBrains on GPT-5 is the latest example of how their feedback and early testing will help us identify the API’s optimal impact where it matters most for their users.”\nOlivier Godement, Head of Business Products at OpenAI\nBased on our testing, we consider GPT-5 a game changer for coding. It can handle larger, more complex development tasks with greater accuracy and reliability.\nJunie, the coding agent, now powered by GPT-5\nWith GPT-5 integrated, Junie becomes significantly more capable. In our internal benchmarks, GPT-5 delivered 1.5× to 2× improvements in code quality, task complexity handling, and overall performance compared to the previous OpenAI models. GPT-5 is set as the default model for Junie, but you can always change it in the plugin’s settings. \nIn this example, Junie was asked to create a hidden snake game as an Easter egg in a footer. \n\n\n\n\nIt not only identified the precise place to inject the feature in a large codebase, but it also accounted for dependencies and layout constraints – delivering production-ready code, fully integrated and bug-free.\nJetBrains AI Assistant gets a boost with GPT-5\nWith the latest update, JetBrains AI Assistant now has GPT-5 selected as the default model for chat, as it offers the best generation quality currently available, balanced with optimized costs.\nIn the example below, we give AI Assistant a single prompt asking it to create an HTML5 page showing what a JetBrains IDE could look like in 2030. This single prompt was enough for GPT-5 to generate a fully responsive, styled, and interactive prototype, demonstrating its exceptional capabilities when paired with JetBrains AI Assistant.\n\n\n\n\nHow to try GPT-5 in your IDE\nYou can try GPT-5 in your JetBrains IDE (starting from version 2025.2) by updating to the latest versions of the AI Assistant and Junie plugins (Settings | Plugins). GPT-5 will be available in AI Assistant’s chat and Junie as your default model.\nGet Started\n                                                    \nPowering creators with no-code solutions via Kineto and GPT-5 \nGPT-5 is particularly useful when it comes to frontend-related tasks. This is why we set this model as the default for Kineto, our brand-new no-code AI platform for generating websites and apps. GPT-5 gave Kineto a significant boost in creating single-purpose apps from user prompts with no coding required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKineto is now in the Early Access Program. Join the waitlist to try it. \nHappy developing!",

        "pubDate": "Wed, 06 Aug 2025 12:51:23 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "You’ve seen it before. Someone says, “It works on my machine,” and suddenly you’re deep in a rabbit hole trying to understand why a project that works perfectly on one machine fails to build or test on another.\nThat’s configuration drift – when a developer’s actual environment starts to deviate from the project’s intended configuration. It’s subtle, builds up over time, and can create serious issues.\nWhy it happens\nRarely intentional, configuration drift occurs when your development environment, including its associated packages, versions, system tools, and environment variables, slowly strays from the standard setup everyone is supposed to use.\nSome collaborators update their version of Node.js or Python, others don’t. Someone installs a CLI tool globally. Someone else tweaks a config file and forgets to share it. Files like .env.local or ignored setup scripts go out of sync. None of this is malicious – it’s just difficult to keep track of every little change you make to your setup over time. However, when it happens across a team, the differences pile up fast.\nWhy configuration drift is a real problem\nOn small projects, config drift is annoying. On larger ones, it can quickly cause major headaches. Some of the main issues that configuration drift can lead to include:\nConfiguration discrepancies\nThis is where the classic “But it works on my machine” comment typically arises. You get a bug report from a teammate, but you can’t reproduce it because your environment isn’t quite the same as theirs. Now the team is stuck hunting for invisible differences in local setups.\nInconsistent test results\nOne dev runs the test suite, and everything passes. Another runs it, and half the tests fail. It turns out they had slightly different dependency versions or a missing env var. Nobody wins.\nBroken CI/CD pipelines\nThe code works fine locally but breaks during deployment. CI environments generally enforce stricter and more consistent configurations than local machines. If you forget to commit a config or miss a setup step, the CI server will quickly expose the issue.\nWasted time debugging the setup\nMuch of the onboarding process for new developers involves tracking down weird setup issues. Every little obstacle – whether a misconfigured shell, a missing Python version, or a random global package – chips away at productivity.\nNo matter the symptom, the result is the same: hours lost on non-coding work, slower teams, frustrated devs, and harder-to-maintain projects. And none of this work involves the actual product. It’s about addressing environment-related issues.\nSo, how do people usually deal with it?\nMost teams try to keep developer environments consistent. Some methods help a lot, while others just mask the problem. Let’s look at the most common approaches and where they fall short.\nPinning tool versions and environment variables\nThis is where most projects start. You pin your Node.js or Python version using tools like nvm, pyenv, or asdf. You commit a .tool-versions or .nvmrc file so that everyone runs the same runtime.\nNext comes the .env file. You insert your API URLs, tokens, and maybe a couple of feature flags and call it a day.\nThis works until someone forgets to source the .env file, uses a newer tool version locally, or runs into a weird bug because their shell config or OS version is slightly different.\nThe bottom line is this tactic sets expectations but doesn’t enforce anything.\nAutomating setup with scripts\nWhatever your team uses, whether Makefiles, Bash scripts, just, or Ansible, the idea is the same: one command sets up your whole development environment.\nAs this approach gives you reproducible setup instructions and helps new teammates onboard faster, it’s more effective. But it’s not a silver bullet. These scripts aren’t idempotent. They assume a clean state. If a developer tweaks something manually later, the script won’t fix it. And it can’t stop configuration drift once it starts.\nUsing dev containers or declarative environments\nDockerfiles and devcontainer.json definitions let you standardize development at the system level. Add Nix, Guix, or Devbox to the mix, and now you can describe everything (dependencies, system packages, and tooling) in a single config file.\nAs this approach allows you to rebuild the same environment every time, it’s a big step forward with no surprises.\nHowever, working inside Docker can feel clunky. Performance isn’t always great, debugging can be painful, and advanced tools like Nix, while powerful, are notoriously hard to learn. One wrong expression and you’re staring at a wall of cryptic errors.\nSo yes, these approaches reduce drift, but they also add friction. And you’re still ultimately running things on different machines with different host systems, hardware, and edge cases.\nA better solution: Cloud dev environments\nImagine if your dev environment didn’t live on your laptop, but it felt like it did. With today’s cloud development environments (CDEs), your workspace runs remotely, but the UI is streamed using optimized protocols designed specifically for coding and development tasks – no clunky VDI. The result? A native-like IDE experience that’s fast, responsive, and consistent, no matter where you are – no hidden state or outdated dependencies! It’s like getting a fresh, clean laptop every time you open your IDE.\nBut running CDEs at scale requires a way to define, manage, and connect those environments to the tools your team already uses. That’s where orchestration solutions like GitHub Codespaces, Gitpod, and Coder come in, providing a control layer over CDEs.\nAt JetBrains, we’ve built our own CDE orchestrator: CodeCanvas. It gives you everything you’d expect from a CDE orchestration platform, including centralized templates, setup scripts, and security policies, but with one huge advantage – first-class support for JetBrains IDEs. And if you’re more into VS Code or Cursor, CodeCanvas supports those tools, too.\nJetBrains CodeCanvas\nIf you’re ready to give CDEs a try, install CodeCanvas in your AWS account. It takes only a few steps:\nLaunch the installation (an AWS account is required)\nFollow the installation instructions\n\n\n\n\nPlanning a more complex setup or looking to discuss how CodeCanvas can work in your infrastructure? Contact us – we’ll be happy to help!\nWant to learn more about the benefits of CDEs and whether your company should consider adopting them?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to this month’s Java Annotated Monthly – your pit stop for all things related to Java, Kotlin, frameworks, and the ever-shifting tech scene. From helpful reads to red-hot takes, we’ve lined up a range of articles for curious devs and ambitious teams.\nBut wait, there’s more! As always, our AI corner is here, and we’ve sprinkled in some thought-provoking, non-tech gems on building better teams and smarter products.\nOh, and don’t miss the special feature by A N M Bazlur Rahman! He’s bringing you his top picks, personal reflections, and sharp takes on where the dev world’s heading. Trust us, it’s a ride worth taking.\nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nA N M Bazlur Rahman\n\nA N M Bazlur Rahman is a Java Champion, Jakarta EE Ambassador, and Software Engineer with over 12 years of specialized experience in Java and related technologies. He is the founder and moderator of the Java User Group in Bangladesh, and has been organizing educational meetups and conferences since 2013. Bazlur is a veteran editor at InfoQ and a contributing editor at Foojay.io. He has authored six books on Java programming, including Modern Concurrency in Java with O’Reilly, scheduled for release in September. He is also working on his seventh book, Build Smart Java Applications with Large Language Models, with his friend Shaaf Syed and Manning Publications. When not coding or writing, you can find him speaking at conferences and Java User Groups, sharing his passion for Java, Jakarta EE, and the integration of AI technologies into enterprise applications.\n \n\n\nJava and AI integration takes center stage\nAs a Java developer with a recent interest in the AI integration space, I’m excited to share what I consider the most transformative period in Java’s 30-year history. The ecosystem has reached a tipping point where AI integration is no longer experimental. It’s production-ready, and Java developers are embracing it at an unprecedented pace. From my recent talk at GeeCON 2025 in Kraków to my hands-on experiments building AI-powered applications, I’ve witnessed firsthand how Java is becoming the go-to platform for enterprise AI development.\nThe foundation of this revolution lies in the language itself. JDK 25 is shaping up to be a landmark release, with features that directly benefit AI workloads. The game changer is JEP 519: Compact Object Headers, with Amazon reporting 22% less heap usage and 8% faster execution in production. However, what really excites me is JEP 505: Structured Concurrency (Fifth Preview), which I explored in depth in my article, Java’s Structured Concurrency: Finally Finding Its Footing. This feature simplifies concurrent programming by treating related tasks as single units, making them ideal for orchestrating multiple AI model calls. Combined with instance main methods becoming final in JDK 25, which provides a pleasing experience for beginners, Project Leyden and the evolving Vector API are positioning Java as a serious contender for AI workloads.\nThe framework landscape has me particularly excited. The general availability of Spring AI 1.0 streamlines AI app development with support for 20+ models and built-in RAG capabilities. LangChain4j’s 1.1.0 release introduces comprehensive guardrail support – something I’ve written about extensively in Building Robust AI Applications with LangChain4j Guardrails and Spring Boot, complete with plenty of code examples. Microsoft’s strategic partnership with LangChain4j has resulted in extensive security audits, making it truly enterprise-ready. However, the real showstopper is Rod Johnson’s Embabel agent framework, which he describes as “the most significant project since Spring Framework itself.” It brings goal-oriented action planning from gaming to create deterministic, explainable AI agents with strong typing. What’s equally exciting is seeing the integration of LangChain4j with MicroProfile and Jakarta specifications take shape, bringing AI capabilities to enterprise Java standards. \nTo help developers navigate this landscape, my friend Shaaf Syed and I created the llm-jakarta GitHub project, which provides a progressive learning path through Jakarta EE and LLM integration, comprising 10 practical steps. We plan to add more examples combining Spring Boot and Quarkus soon. \nFor those interested in GPU acceleration, I recommend checking out GPULlama3.java Brings GPU-Accelerated LLM Inference to Pure Java, which showcases how Java can leverage hardware acceleration for AI workloads.\nCloud providers are fully committed to Java’s AI future. Oracle launched generative AI with LangChain4j integration, and Google released their Agent Development Kit for Java, both of which are crucial for adopting modern AI features. Microsoft’s comprehensive Java and AI strategy includes native integration with Azure. \nI’ve been experimenting with these features extensively, documenting my findings in my newsletter, The Coding Café, where I share practical experiments, such as building FormPilot and creating an AI-powered flight tracker.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Welcome to the first-ever standalone What’s Fixed overview of an IntelliJ IDEA release!\nWe are always working hard to make the IDE even more stable, reliable, and enjoyable to use. In previous releases, information about this work was blended into the What’s New content, making it very long and sometimes hard to grasp. To address this issue, we’ve decided to focus the What’s New only on the most impactful and noticeable changes and to introduce a dedicated What’s Fixed article that focuses on the stability and quality improvements.\nThe key areas we have been working on in this release are:\nSpring support\n\nKotlin support in Spring projects\nSpring Security and Spring Web\nRemote development\nSupport for WSL\nKotlin K2 mode\nKotlin Notebook\nMaven execution\nCloud tooling\nPerformance\nBut that’s not everything. For the full list of fixes and improvements, please refer to the release notes. \nImproved Kotlin support for Spring projects\nWith Kotlin proving itself as a good fit for the Spring Framework, more and more people are using it in Spring projects. To deliver the best developer experience, we formed a partnership between Kotlin and Spring, and we are actively improving IntelliJ IDEA’s Kotlin-Spring support. Version 2025.2 brings:\nLive templates and context menu actions for creating Spring beans quickly, along with improvements to the Logical structure view to make understanding the relations between application components easier.\nSmarter bean support: No more false injection points for constructor parameters for @SpringBootTest or for parameters with defaults, and improved handling of @ConditionalOnProperty beans.\nConfiguration made clear: The ability to go from @ConfigurationProperties to YAML or properties with a click, default values in code completion, and full support for nested properties.\nSpring MVC improvements: An easier experience with path variables in request handlers, thanks to clear feedback when something doesn’t match.\nSpring Data fixes: Better repository method completion for is properties, as well as cleaner support for varargs, projections, and named queries.\nSpring Framework support\nSpring Framework support is a key focus area for IntelliJ IDEA. In addition to new functionality such as Spring Debugger, we continue to enhance existing features.\nIn this release, we’ve resolved a couple of minor but frustrating issues related to rule parsing in Spring Security:\nCustom login and logout URLs are now processed correctly. \nComplex security configurations involving multiple role assignments for a single endpoint are now properly parsed.\nWe’ve also enhanced support for the widely used Spring Web library. URL references – especially in MockMvc tests – are now properly recognized and autocompleted.\nRemote development\nRemote development – connecting to a powerful remote host where the IDE runs from a thin frontend client – is becoming the norm, with many enterprises relying on it.\nWe are fully committed to making the remote development experience in IntelliJ IDEA equal to the local one. While it has proven to be a hard endeavor for such a complex product as IntelliJ IDEA, and achieving this goal is taking time, version 2025.2 marks a huge step in this direction:\nThe editor is now as responsive when working remotely as it is in a local setup.\nThis is also true for the Search Everywhere, Find in Files, and Git Branches popups.\nThe debugger has been reworked so that its backend is isolated from its frontend, making debugging work natively.\nPlugins and settings are properly synchronized between the client and host.\nLast but not least – remote development connections are now available directly in the Toolbox app, with support for all OS and OpenSSH connections. And you know what? They are at least 1.5x faster!\nFor more details, refer to this blog post.\nSupport for WSL\nThe majority of our users are on Windows, which is known to have some performance limitations and specific toolchains. That is where WSL comes in handy, and roughly one out of every five Windows users works with WSL eventually.\nIntelliJ IDEA has offered WSL support for some time. However, the way we chose to provide the integration proved unscalable and did not work well for large projects – with issues ranging from performance problems to the inability to run or even open projects.\nTo ensure you can stay productive regardless of where your project is, we started a rework of the WSL integration from the ground up. The IntelliJ Platform team created a new API that dramatically reduces communication overhead between the IDE and WSL and allows you to work with WSL projects natively as though they were in the same system as the host IntelliJ IDEA – without needing to spin up a full backend inside WSL.\nWhile this is still a work in progress, we have migrated significant parts of the integration to this new API. As a result, in 2025.2:\nMaven and Gradle projects can be reliably built and tested, with proper JDK detection and better overall performance.\nYou now have a consistent experience with application servers, whether you’re running Tomcat or WildFly servers locally or on WSL.\nFurther improvements to Kotlin K2 mode\nK2 mode, the new default implementation of Kotlin support that improves Kotlin code analysis stability and overall performance, continues to evolve. In this release, we’ve:\nProvided support for Kotlin 2.2 features.\nImproved the performance of code completion.\nAdded type-smart completion support. \nAdded new inspections with corresponding coroutine-specific quick-fixes and refactorings, like Convert Enum to Sealed Class, Extract Interface, Rearrange Code, and Create Test and Navigate for files and functions.\nResolved several false-positive errors in inspections.\nImproved the reliability of Kotlin script execution. \nLearn more about the state of K2 mode in our recent blog post.\nQuality upgrades for Kotlin Notebook\nKotlin Notebook is a go-to tool for performing ad hoc and prototyping tasks, presenting, writing documentation, and visualizing data, all while enjoying access to your project context and easy dependency management. Since its recent release, interest in it has been growing, and we’ve received a lot of feedback that we are now addressing, focusing on stability and the editing experience.\nAI Assistant cells now allow you to choose a model, view the prompt history, and get automatic suggestions.\nIncorrect syntax highlighting has been fixed.\nDependency management has been improved.\nKotlin intentions and inspections have been added to make the editing experience close to what you get in a regular .kt file. \nMaven execution\nMaven integration is used by half of our users. Historically, IntelliJ IDEA has additional configuration layers on top of Maven, and while they bring speed and control, some differences between execution from the IDE and from the CLI could occur. \nOne of the common reasons for such problems was that the specific environment configuration – the .m2/settings file, .mavenrc, or environment variables – was not properly inherited. Starting from 2025.2, IntelliJ IDEA starts Maven goals in such a way that the environment is fully respected.\nThanks to this change, it is now possible to use the Maven Daemon for goal execution. If you have one installed, specify it as a Maven home path in File | Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Build Tools | Maven, and all goals will be run using it, speeding things up a bit and reducing resource usage.\nProject sync and goal execution now also support plugins that supply custom M2E lifecycles, for example, Byte Buddy. When such plugins are present, the required pre-build and post-build steps will be configured and executed as necessary.\nCloud tooling\nInteraction with cloud services is now a major part of software development workflows. This includes the building, deployment, and sometimes managing remote environments. Terraform and Kubernetes are key tools in these scenarios, which is why they are our focus areas.\nFor Terraform, the 2025.2 update brings: \nBetter support for provider-defined functions:\n\nCorrect syntax highlighting.\nQuick navigation to provider definitions. \nOn-hover documentation.\nDefault code formatter.\nAuto-completion for object variables. \nSpecific support for the Keycloak provider.\nSupport for resources in Google Cloud Beta.\nAbility to use for_each in import blocks.\nAccurate binary detection on Windows.\nTerraform file recognition.\nFor Kubernetes, there are: \nImproved port-forwarding with automatic suggestions for ports and real-time checks for availability.\nBetter performance when working with large log files.\nMore information about pods.\nAuto-marking of the active cluster.\nOn top of that, this update improves the GitLab CI integration with: \nSmarter support for CI language variable expressions.\nRich code completion. \nOn-hover documentation. \nSupport for injecting shell code directly into your pipelines.\nDebugger\nDebugging and profiling are essential tools for developing high-quality software, and we strive to make sure that IntelliJ IDEA’s debugger remains best in class. On top of the huge rework to provide a native debugging experience when working remotely, we’ve also fixed issues and provided additional capabilities for existing use cases.\nYou can now evaluate code on any application pause during execution, not just at breakpoints.\nThe Analyze Stack Trace or Thread Dump action can now analyze outputs from the jstack and jcmd tools, including in the new JSON format.\nThe Collect Thread Dump action now works with the Eclipse OpenJ9 JVM.\nGraalVM debugger\nCompiling JVM applications to native code significantly reduces CPU and memory usage, but debugging native images remains challenging. In this release, we’ve improved the native image debugger:\nVariable rendering provides richer information, for example, full object content and details about proxy objects.\nExpression evaluation has been enhanced, making reflection calls such as clazz.getMethod(“myMethod”).invoke(instance) work correctly. \nProfiler \nThe profiling experience depends on the Java version, and there used to be cases when it didn’t work with Java 24 and the upcoming Java 25. We fixed the failures and implemented support for new language features. You can now reliably profile your application on any Java version and also easily integrate Async-Profiler 4 into your workflow.\nPerformance\nTerminal\nIn 2025.2, we’ve enabled the reworked terminal for all users. This change brings significant improvements in rendering and overall terminal performance. For bash and zsh, it also brings some minor visual changes, but without compromising the shells’ behavior. \nWorking with data sources\nWhen working with large databases, the IDE used to load the entire schema, which produced overhead and was rather slow. Now, PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server are introspected by levels, so only specific parts of the schema are loaded, reducing this overhead.\nPostgreSQL users also benefit from smart refresh, which updates only the objects affected by DDL changes.\nDeveloper experience\nWe have also invested effort into small UX improvements, especially in areas related to reading code. For example, we’ve reworked the Parameter Info popup to make it cleaner, more readable, and easier to use across all supported languages.\nThat’s it for now \nLet us know what you think about the fixes and priorities in this release. Your feedback helps us steer the product so it works best for you.\nUpdate to IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 now and see how it has improved. Don’t forget to join us on X, Bluesky, or LinkedIn and share your favorite updates. \nThank you for using IntelliJ IDEA!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The value of extensibility\nThe ability to extend and customize software, from game mods to browser extensions, gives users a sense of freedom and the chance to bring their ideas to life. JetBrains IDEs already provide this sense of freedom through their support for plugins.\nFor some time now, creating plugins for JetBrains IDEs has been possible, but getting started with these sorts of projects can be intimidating. Navigating documentation, project templates, IntelliJ Platform dependencies, and Gradle configurations can be overwhelming for those wanting to experiment and test their ideas in real-world scenarios. Luckily, there’s now a more efficient option!\nIntroducing Kotlin Notebook\nKotlin Notebook is an interactive platform for data analysis, visualization, and prototyping with Kotlin. Like Jupyter Notebook, it provides a robust environment for data scientists, engineers, and researchers to explore and showcase their work within a dynamic, executable document. It combines Kotlin’s capabilities with the interactiveness of notebooks, allowing you to write and run code while seeing the results and visualizations in the same environment. This encourages an iterative workflow, boosting productivity and collaboration on data projects.\nBuilding on the Kotlin Notebook plugin, we have started exploring how to connect it with the IntelliJ Platform. This enables the direct execution of IntelliJ Platform code from a notebook file within the active IDE runtime. The iterative workflow of Kotlin notebooks allows you to brainstorm, build, and test plugin features faster. The integration with the IntelliJ Platform makes moving the finished code into your plugin easy.\nThis initial idea has developed into a strong integration, and as of the 2025.2 release, the functionality is now available for use.\nGetting started: A practical guide\nTo get started, create a new Kotlin notebook either as a new file in your project or as a scratch file, using ⌘⇧N on macOS or Ctrl+Shift+N on Windows/Linux.\nNotebooks are based on the concept of cells. To start using this integration, switch to Run in IDE Process mode, create a new code cell, and declare:\n%use intellij-platform\nDue to the technical issues on Windows, it’s recommended to explicitly request the latest available version until the IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2.1 is released using:\n%useLatestDescriptors\n%use intellij-platform\nOnce you do this, the necessary IntelliJ Platform libraries will be loaded into the notebook’s classpaths, making them available for import in the subsequent cells.\n\nCore features\nUI rendering made simple\nThe ability to run code within the same IDE environment removes the need to build a full plugin project to test UI components. The runInEdt {} The helper ensures that the code runs on the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), catching any exceptions and showing them below your cell.\n\nReturning UI elements as a response when working with the Kotlin UI DSL or standard Swing components renders them immediately. All rendered components stay fully interactive.\n\nResource management with the Disposer\nThe integration uses the Disposer mechanism available in the IntelliJ Platform. A dedicated global notebookDisposable variable allows for registering and later disposing of specific notebook elements, such as extensions, listeners, actions, or UI components. This ensures the IDE manages the lifetime of your objects when you close the project or restart the notebook.\n// Register something that needs cleanup\nDisposer.register(notebookDisposable, myDisposable)\n\nDisposer.register(notebookDisposable) {\n  // Cleanup components directly\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading plugins\nWhen you integrate your notebook with the IntelliJ Platform, only the core platform is initially loaded into the classpath, similarly to when you’re working on a standalone plugin. However, you may need to depend on and use other plugins, whether bundled or installed from JetBrains Marketplace. To load plugins installed in your IDE, you must explicitly call the loadPlugins(vararg pluginIds: String) helper.\n// Load specific plugins\nloadPlugins(\"Git4Idea\", \"com.intellij.java\")\n\nExtension registration\nIn traditional plugin development, extensions are defined in the plugin.xml file. With Kotlin notebooks, you can dynamically register extensions using registerExtension(), avoiding the need for a structured plugin project.\nFor example, to register a custom ChatMessageHandler and ChatAgent for the AI Assistant plugin, you can simply run the following:\nloadPlugins(\"com.intellij.ml.llm\")\nclass MyChatMessageHandler : ChatMessageHandler {\n\n    override fun isApplicable(project: Project, kind: ChatKind, userMessage: UserMessage) = true\n\n    override fun createAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        userMessage: UserMessage,\n        kind: ChatKind,\n    ) = SimpleCompletableMessage(chat)\n\n    override suspend fun serveAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        answerMessage: ChatMessage,\n        smartChatEndpoints: List<SmartChatEndpoint>,\n    ) {\n        ChatAgent.EP_NAME.extensionList\n            .find { it.id == \"groot\" }\n            ?.serveAnswerMessage(project, chat, answerMessage)\n    }\n}\n\nregisterExtension(ChatMessageHandler.EP, MyChatMessageHandler())\nclass MyChatAgent : ChatAgent {\n\n    override val id = \"groot\"\n    override val name = \"I am Groot\"\n\n    override fun createAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        userMessage: UserMessage,\n        kind: ChatKind,\n    ) = SimpleCompletableMessage(chat)\n\n    override suspend fun serveAnswerMessage(\n        project: Project,\n        chat: ChatSession,\n        answerMessage: ChatMessage,\n    ) {\n        answerMessage as SimpleCompletableMessage\n        answerMessage.appendText(\"*I am Groot*\".privacyConst)\n    }\n}\n\nregisterExtension(ChatAgent.EP_NAME, MyChatAgent())\nSimilarly, you can register a custom UI theme as follows:\nimport com.intellij.ide.ui.UIThemeProvider\n\nval theme = UIThemeProvider().apply { \n    id = \"My Theme\"\n    path = \"Theme.json\"\n}\nregisterExtension(UIThemeProvider.EP_NAME, theme)\nThis approach allows you to experiment and test extensions instantly within the IDE runtime, streamlining development and saving time.\nExploring your IDE environment\nThe integration provides several ways to access the internal details of the currently running IDE, such as its build details and location in the file system. Exposed mechanisms such as the Plugin Manager and Plugin Repository allow for interacting with plugins available in JetBrains Marketplace, or even ones installed locally. All available variables and helper methods are documented in the relevant section in the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation.\n// Access IDE information\nproductInfo.name        // \"IntelliJ IDEA\"\nproductInfo.version     // \"2025.3\"\nproductInfo.buildNumber // \"253.xxxx\"\n\nidePath // “/Users/hsz/Applications/IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2025.3 Nightly.app/Contents”\n\nide // com.jetbrains.plugin.structure.ide.Ide instance\n\n// Work with the plugin manager\npluginManager.findEnabledPlugin(PluginId.getId(\"com.intellij.java\"))\n\n// Request JetBrains Marketplace\npluginRepository.pluginManager.searchCompatibleUpdates(\n    build = \"${productInfo.productCode}-${productInfo.buildNumber}\",\n    xmlIds = listOf(“org.jetbrains.junie”),\n    channel = “default”,\n)\nOpportunities and improvements\nIntegrating Kotlin Notebook with the IntelliJ Platform represents a significant step forward for custom plugin development. With traditional barriers associated with project setup, compilation, and deployment removed, developers can now concentrate more effectively on implementing their ideas.\nWe already have great ideas for ways to improve this experience further:\nRapid prototyping of IDE features and plugins: This functionality allows for the development of features, with the potential for AI assistance in the refinement process. Once you’ve completed a scratch implementation of your plugin in your notebook file and it is ready to be adapted for use in a Plugin Template-based project, you can use Junie to convert it and give it a formal plugin structure.\nExpeditious testing of platform APIs and behaviors: The JetBrains QA teams are already using Kotlin notebooks to debug the IntelliJ Platform more quickly, achieving particular success when using them with a UI testing framework. Improving scripting and adding reusable helpers can make notebooks more adaptable and suited to this use case.\nInteractive documentation and tutorials for IntelliJ Platform development: The storytelling style of notebooks, combining runnable code snippets with explanatory comments, can create a more engaging learning experience.\nCompose/Jewel support: As development advances in this area, the ability to render Compose/Jewel components is a natural next step, mirroring the current functionality supplied by Java Swing or the Kotlin UI DSL. This can be especially useful for prototyping IDE-specific UI/UX elements, whether you’re developing plugins or working on an entire IDE based on the IntelliJ Platform.\nTake it for a spin and let us know what you think!\nFollow these simple steps to get started:\nCreate a new Kotlin Notebook.\nSwitch to Run in IDE Process mode.\nUnleash your creativity with %use intellij-platform.\nIf you’d like to share feedback, please visit the JetBrains Platform forum, where we can discuss any challenges and ideas for improving this integration. You can also join the #notebooks public Slack channel for discussions and questions.\nThe IntelliJ Platform integration and the examples featured in this article are now publicly accessible on GitHub, along with a dedicated section in the IntelliJ Platform SDK documentation. We welcome pull requests with ideas to improve the user experience.\nHappy hacking!\nJakub",

        "content": "\n            \n            &lt;p&gt;회사에서 AI 도구를 자유롭게 활용할 수 있도록 지원해 준 덕분에, 그동안 Cursor, Cline, Copilot 등 다양한 코딩 에이전트를 활용해 개발 생산성을 높일 수 있었습니다. 그러던 중 지난 2025년 6월 24일 Anthropic에서 터미널 기반의 코딩 에이전트인 Claude Code를 정식 출시했습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;터미널은 개발자가 컴퓨터와 직접 대화를 나눌 수 있는 창구라서 떼려야 뗄 수 없지만, GUI의 도움을 받아 개발 하다보면 터미널에 익숙하지 않을 수 있습니다. GUI가 편하기도 하고요. 그래서 별도 GUI 인터페이스를 갖추고 있는 Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 사용해 오던 입장에서, 처음에 Claude Code 컨셉만 들었을땐 마냥 불편할 것만 같았습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그런데 막상 써보니 인터페이스가 터미널이라 굉장히 가벼울 뿐 아니라, 특정 IDE에 종속되지 않고 어디서든 쓸 수 있다는 점이 장점으로 느껴졌습니다. 특히 JVM 환경에서 주로 개발하다 보니, 프로젝트 인덱싱, 컴파일, 빌드 등의 과정이 Cursor나 Cline에서는 다소 불편하게 느껴졌는데, Claude Code는 IntelliJ의 터미널에서 실행되니 마치 플러그인 하나 설치해 쓰는 듯한 경험이었습니다. 그래서 Cursor를 주로 사용하던 저는 이제 Claude Code만 쓰는 사람이 되었습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코딩 에이전트를 포함한 AI 기술은 하루가 다르게 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 일주일, 한 달만 지나도 새로운 기술과 모델이 나오고, 이전 것은 금세 시야에서 사라집니다. 개발자는 그때마다 새로운 경험을 맞이하게 됩니다.

간단한 방법은 2가지가 있습니다. 누군가에게 일단 물어보거나, 스스로 알아갈 때까지 고뇌하는 것입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-3&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-3&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이런 상황을 해결하기 위해 회사는 ‘신규 입사자 온보딩’ 프로그램을 운영하곤 합니다. 신규 입사자가 왔을때 여기는 어떤 문화를 가지고 있고, 시스템은 어떻고, 나는 어떤 일을 어떻게 하면 되는지 방법을 알려줍니다. 새로 온 동료가 그동안의 오래된 제품에 대한 맥락과 팀의 일하는 방식을 알아가기 까지 스스로 한다면 더 오랜 시간이 걸릴텐데, 잘 정리되어 있는 문서나 참고해야 할 요소들이 많다면 더 빠르게 알아갈 수 있을거에요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코딩 에이전트도 이와 크게 다르지 않습니다. 무작정 코딩 에이전트에게 ‘1000원 할인 코드 작성해줘’ 라고 하면 코딩 에이전트는 구체적인 정보를 찾기 위해 더 많은 시간을 쓰고 알지 못한다면 추측을 하기도 합니다. 그래서 코딩 에이전트가 나와 수년을 함께 한 동료가 되기 위해서는 알고 있는 모든 것을 알려줘야 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-4&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-4&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;우리 팀의 프로젝트 아키텍처는 어떤 형태로 구성되어 있는지 자세히 알려줘야 합니다. 의존성 규칙과 방향이 강제되어 있다면 이 또한 반드시 알려줘야 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코드 컨벤션이 있다면 이 또한 자세히 가이드 해줘야 합니다. 팀에서 사용중인 코드 컨벤션이 없다면 각 언어의 공식 컨벤션이라도 알려주면 좋습니다. 저희 팀은 클래스 네이밍에 Alistair Cockburn이 언급한 원칙인 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;the name should be the goal as a short active verb phrase&lt;/code&gt; 을 준수합니다. 이름만 보고도 그 클래스의 역할과 책임이 명확히 드러나야 하고, 역할과 책임 그리고 의미있는 접미사/접두사를 사용합니다. 그래서 대부분의 클래스는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;동사 + 역할 + 접미사&lt;/code&gt; 의 조합으로 이름을 짓고 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-5&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-5&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;팀에서 사용중인 테스트 작성법이 있다면 이것도 자세히 알려줍니다. 저희 팀은 외부 의존성이 필요한 Mocking Library 사용을 지양하고, 조금 더 Production Code 변화에 유연하게 대응하기 위해 Test Double을 직접 만들어서 사용합니다. 그리고 테스트 코드를 구조화해서 가독성, 유지보수성, 일관성을 끌어 올리기 위해 AAA(Arrange, Act, Assert) 패턴을 사용합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-6&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-6&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;커밋을 작성할 때에도 기본 형식이 있습니다. 커밋 메시지의 맨 앞에는 이슈 티켓을 입력하고, 그 다음에는 어떤 유형의 커밋이고 어떤 모듈의 변화인지, 그리고 마지막에는 커밋의 설명을 간단하게 작성합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GZ-{티켓번호} {타입}({모듈}): {설명}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-7&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-7&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claude Code는 우리 팀이 이렇게 일한다는 사실을 알고 있을까요?

Claude Code가 일을 잘 해서 그런것도 있지만, 초기에 Rule 셋팅하는 시간을 많이 투자한 덕분이라고 생각합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;단순한 기능을 만들 때에는 가이드 없이 Claude Code를 바로 사용해도 좋다고 생각합니다. 하지만 조금 복잡해지거나 도메인 규칙을 이해해야 한다거나, 우리 팀만의 가이드에 따라 코드 작성이 필요하다면 바로 사용하는건 멈추고 Rule 부터 정돈하기를 권장합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마지막으로, 작성된 모든 내용은 제 개인적인 의견이고 소수의 인원이 작업을 하는 곳보다 다수의 인원이 같은 Repository에 작업을 할 때에는 더 빛을 보는 방법이니 참고해주세요. 모두 복리의 마법을 믿고 코딩 대탈출 하셨으면 좋겠습니다!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;P.S. 발표 자료는 일부 내용 제거된 형태로 업로드 되어 있습니다. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sungjk/sungjk.github.io/tree/master/images/2025/08/09/ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf&quot;&gt;ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf&lt;/a&gt;를 참고하시면 됩니다. 궁금하신 점이 있으면 편하게 메일로 연락 주세요.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n            \n          ",

GUI가 편하기도 하고요. 그래서 별도 GUI 인터페이스를 갖추고 있는 Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 사용해 오던 입장에서, 처음에 Claude Code 컨셉만 들었을땐 마냥 불편할 것만 같았습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그런데 막상 써보니 인터페이스가 터미널이라 굉장히 가벼울 뿐 아니라, 특정 IDE에 종속되지 않고 어디서든 쓸 수 있다는 점이 장점으로 느껴졌습니다. 특히 JVM 환경에서 주로 개발하다 보니, 프로젝트 인덱싱, 컴파일, 빌드 등의 과정이 Cursor나 Cline에서는 다소 불편하게 느껴졌는데, Claude Code는 IntelliJ의 터미널에서 실행되니 마치 플러그인 하나 설치해 쓰는 듯한 경험이었습니다. 그래서 Cursor를 주로 사용하던 저는 이제 Claude Code만 쓰는 사람이 되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>코딩 에이전트를 포함한 AI 기술은 하루가 다르게 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 일주일, 한 달만 지나도 새로운 기술과 모델이 나오고, 이전 것은 금세 시야에서 사라집니다. 개발자는 그때마다 새로운 경험을 맞이하게 됩니다. Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 쓰면서 이 다음에 뭐가 나올까 궁금했는데 Claude Code가 하나의 변곡점이 될 거라는 느낌을 받았습니다.</p>\n\n<p>혼자서 스터디도 하고 사내 엔지니어들과 이야기를 나누면서 Claude Code를 더 잘 써보기 위한 방법들을 하나 둘 찾아나갔고, 지난 달 전사 테크 올핸즈에서 ‘<strong>한 번 쓰고 끝이 아니다. 끊임없이 진화하는 코딩 에이전트 활용법</strong>’ 이라는 주제로 Claude Code 사용 방법에 대해 공유했습니다.</p>\n\n<p>결국 코딩 에이전트를 사용하는 목적 중 하나는 생산성을 극대화 시키기 위함인데, 코딩 에이전트에게 무언가 시키고 나면 다시 제가 직접 수정하는 일이 생겼고 이건 목적에서 조금은 벗어난다는 생각이 들었습니다. ‘이럴 거면 내가 짜는 게 낫지‘ 라는 결론으로 이어질 수도 있고요. 그래서 Claude Code를 더 잘 활용하기 위해 Rules, Custom commands, Hooks 등을 작성했고, 머지 않아 또 다른 패러다임에 변화가 올거라 믿지만, 개인 블로그에도 간단하게 기록차 남겨봅니다.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"claude-code-101\">Claude Code 101</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-1.png\" alt=\"claude-code-101-1\" title=\"claude-code-101-1\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>다들 첫 출근날과 처음으로 업무 받은 날을 기억하나요?

Claude Code가 일을 잘 해서 그런것도 있지만, 초기에 Rule 셋팅하는 시간을 많이 투자한 덕분이라고 생각합니다.</p>\n\n<p>단순한 기능을 만들 때에는 가이드 없이 Claude Code를 바로 사용해도 좋다고 생각합니다. 하지만 조금 복잡해지거나 도메인 규칙을 이해해야 한다거나, 우리 팀만의 가이드에 따라 코드 작성이 필요하다면 바로 사용하는건 멈추고 Rule 부터 정돈하기를 권장합니다.</p>\n\n<p>마지막으로, 작성된 모든 내용은 제 개인적인 의견이고 소수의 인원이 작업을 하는 곳보다 다수의 인원이 같은 Repository에 작업을 할 때에는 더 빛을 보는 방법이니 참고해주세요. 모두 복리의 마법을 믿고 코딩 대탈출 하셨으면 좋겠습니다!</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>P.S. 발표 자료는 일부 내용 제거된 형태로 업로드 되어 있습니다. <a href=\"https://github.com/sungjk/sungjk.github.io/tree/master/images/2025/08/09/ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf\">ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf</a>를 참고하시면 됩니다. 궁금하신 점이 있으면 편하게 메일로 연락 주세요.</li>\n</ul>",

GPT-5에서는 '짧고 강한' 프롬프트로 목표를 명확히 제시하는 것이 중요해요. 다음은 GPT-5에 최적화된 실전 프롬프트 팁입니다.\n과업 정의 먼저: \"목표-성공 기준-제약(예산/길이/톤)-산출 형식\"을 간결하게 명시하세요. 길고 복잡한 배경 설명보다, 무엇을 원하는지 명확히 하는 것이 훨씬 중요합니다.\n난이도 힌트 제공: \"고정확도 필요, 단계별 검증·반례 점검 포함\"과 같은 문구를 통해 AI에게 추론의 깊이를 요구하세요. 이는 GPT-5의 딥 리즈닝 모드를 유도하는 효과적인 방법입니다.\n안전 범위 지정: \"법률 자문 아님, 공개 자료 근거만, 위험 요소는 일반 원칙으로\"와 같이 경계선을 명확히 지정하여 AI가 불필요한 회피를 줄이고 유용한 답변을 하도록 유도하세요.\n파라미터 활용: \"말수를 줄여라\" 같은 반복 지시 대신, `verbosity` 같은 전용 API 매개변수를 활용해 상세도와 길이를 조절하세요.\n도구 사용 조건 명시: \"최신 데이터 필요 시 검색 사용, 인용 근거 요약\"처럼 툴 사용 조건을 과제에 포함시켜 AI가 필요한 도구를 적절히 사용하도록 유도할 수 있습니다.\n \n고급 프롬프트 생성기 프로: 실용적인 프롬프트의 자동화  \nGPT-5의 강력한 기능을 제대로 활용하려면 새로운 접근법이 필요해요. 그래서 저는 GPT-5의 특성에 최적화된 두 가지 맞춤형 GPTs를 만들고 스마트스토어에 등록했습니다. 먼저, '고급 프롬프트 생성기 프로'는 최신 LLM 최적화 기법을 기반으로, 에이전트 워크플로우, 코딩, 창작 활동 등 다양한 시나리오에 맞는 고품질 프롬프트를 자동 생성하는 전문 도구입니다. 이 GPTs는 사용자의 키워드만으로도 전문적인 프롬프트를 만들어내는 것이 특징이죠.\n  고급 프롬프트 생성기 프로의 특별한 기능\n스마트 분류: 사용자의 키워드 입력을 분석해 에이전트, 코딩, 창작, 분석 등 최적의 프롬프트 유형을 자동으로 식별합니다.\n고급 최적화: GPT-5에 새로 도입된 `reasoning_effort` (추론 수준)나 `verbosity` (상세도) 같은 첨단 매개변수를 활용하여 프롬프트를 최적화합니다.\n성능 향상 팁: 생성된 프롬프트와 함께 성능을 극대화할 수 있는 추가 팁과 모범 사례를 제공해줍니다.\n다중 도메인 지원: 코딩, 분석, 창작, 비즈니스 자동화 등 다양한 분야의 작업을 포괄하여 지원합니다.\n이 GPTs는 특히 에이전트 작업 시 맥락 수집 전략, 도구 호출 예산, 진행 상황 업데이트 형식 등을 명확하게 정의하여 AI의 자율성을 효과적으로 제어할 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 코딩 작업의 경우 Next.js, TypeScript와 같은 특정 프레임워크에 최적화된 프롬프트도 제공합니다.\n \n\n \nChatGPT - 고급 프롬프트 생성기 프로\n최신 LLM 최적화 기법을 기반으로 최적화된 프롬프트를 생성하는 전문 도구입니다. 에이전트 워크플로우, 코딩, 지시 따르기, 도구 호출 등 다양한 시나리오에 맞는 고품질 프롬프트를 생성하여\nchatgpt.com\n\n \n \n스마트 프롬프트 아키텍트: 복잡한 작업을 위한 설계 전문가  ️\n다음으로 소개해 드릴 '스마트 프롬프트 아키텍트'는 GPT-5의 특성에 맞게 '실행 전 계획 단계', '검증 체크포인트'를 포함한 완전한 프롬프트를 설계해주는 전문가입니다. 단순히 요청을 나열하는 것이 아니라, AI가 작업을 해결하기 위한 체계적인 사고 프로세스를 갖추도록 돕는 것이죠. 이 GPTs는 사용자의 키워드를 분석해 작업 유형을 분류하고, GPT-5 모델 특성에 맞는 구조화된 프롬프트를 설계합니다.\n  스마트 프롬프트 아키텍트의 설계 원칙\n계획 단계 포함: 요청을 분해하고, 모호성을 식별하며, 구조화된 접근법을 취하는 계획 단계를 프롬프트에 명시합니다.\n완전한 작업 해결 지향: 모든 하위 작업을 식별하고 순차적 완료를 확인하는 프로세스를 프롬프트에 담아 완전한 문제 해결을 지향합니다.\nXML 구조화: `request`, `task_spec`, `instructions`, `constraints`와 같은 XML 태그를 활용하여 프롬프트의 명확성을 극대화합니다.\n특히 블로그 콘텐츠 생성 요청 시에는 타겟 독자층 명확화, 콘텐츠 길이 및 형식 지정, 경쟁사 차별화 포인트, SEO 최적화 등을 자동으로 포함시켜줍니다. 이러한 구조화된 프롬프트는 AI 모델의 병렬 처리 능력을 활용할 수 있게 하여, 복잡한 작업을 효율적으로 수행하도록 돕습니다.\n \n\n \nChatGPT - 스마트 프롬프트 아키텍트\n키워드를 입력하면 최신 언어모델에 최적화된 구조화된 프롬프트를 자동 생성하는 전문 도구입니다.

        "contentSnippet": "GPT-5 출시 후 겪었던 문제점들과 사라졌던 GPT-4o가 다시 돌아온 이유, 그리고 두 모델을 모두 활용하는 방법까지! 이 글 하나로 GPT-5와 4o를 둘러싼 모든 궁금증을 해결해 드립니다.\n\n\n \n 지난주 OpenAI가 야심차게 GPT-5를 출시했을 때, 많은 이들이 AI의 새로운 시대를 기대했습니다. 하지만 기대와 달리 \"대화 경험이 퇴보했다\"는 사용자들의 불만이 터져 나왔고, 결국 OpenAI는 단종했던 GPT-4o를 다시 서비스하는 이례적인 결정을 내렸습니다. 대체 GPT-5에 무슨 문제가 있었고, 우리는 왜 그토록 GPT-4o를 그리워했던 걸까요? 그 흥미로운 뒷이야기와 함께, 두 모델을 200% 활용하는 방법을 자세히 알려드릴게요! \n \n1. GPT-5의 초기 문제점들  \nGPT-5는 분명 기술적으로 뛰어난 모델이지만, 출시 초기 여러 문제점을 드러내며 사용자들의 기대를 충족시키지 못했습니다. 가장 큰 문제는 새로 도입된 '자동 모델 라우팅 시스템'의 불안정성이었습니다. 이 시스템은 사용자 질문에 맞춰 최적의 서브 모델을 자동으로 선택하도록 설계되었지만, 초기 오류로 인해 오히려 응답 품질이 저하되는 현상이 발생했습니다.\n이로 인해 사용자들은 다음과 같은 불편을 겪었습니다:\n일관성 없는 답변: GPT-5의 답변이 짧고 일관성이 떨어진다는 평가가 많았습니다.\n직관성 및 감성 부족: 일부 요청에서 GPT-4o보다 덜 직관적이고 정서적 반응이 약하다는 피드백이 나왔습니다.\n성능 논란: 느린 응답 속도와 불안정한 답변 품질에 대한 불만이 커뮤니티를 통해 확산되었습니다.\n⚠️ \"친구가 사라졌다\"\n가장 큰 반발은 기존에 잘 사용하던 GPT-4o 모델 선택권을 강제로 없앤 것이었습니다. OpenAI는 GPT-5로의 강제 전환을 시도했지만, 이는 기존 워크플로에 익숙했던 사용자들의 큰 혼란과 불만을 야기했습니다.\n \n2. 논란에도 GPT-5를 출시한 전략적 이유  \n그렇다면 OpenAI는 왜 이런 문제들을 안고서 GPT-5를 서둘러 출시했을까요? 이는 단순한 실수가 아닌, 치밀한 전략적 판단일 가능성이 높습니다.\n시장 주도권 선점: 경쟁사보다 한발 앞서 차세대 모델을 공개함으로써 기술 리더십을 공고히 하고 시장의 관심을 집중시키려는 의도입니다.\n실사용 데이터 확보: 실제 환경에서의 조기 배포를 통해 다양한 버그와 성능 문제를 빠르게 파악하고 개선하기 위한 목적입니다.\n구독자 및 투자자 유지: 지속적으로 새로운 모델을 제공함으로써 유료 구독자의 만족도를 높이고 투자자들에게 성장 가능성을 보여주려는 전략입니다.\n물론 이 전략에는 브랜드 신뢰도 하락과 같은 리스크가 따랐지만, OpenAI는 GPT-4o를 복귀시키는 유연한 대응으로 리스크를 관리하며 장기적인 목표를 추진하고 있습니다.\n \n3. 왜 우리는 GPT-4o를 그리워했을까?  \nGPT-4o가 사용자들에게 특별했던 이유는 단순히 성능이 좋아서가 아니었습니다. GPT-4o는 많은 사람들에게 '친근하고 따뜻한 대화 상대'로 인식되었습니다. 부드러운 어조와 높은 공감 능력은 사용자들이 AI와 정서적인 유대감을 형성하게 만들었죠.\n커뮤니티에서는 GPT-4o를 \"친구\"나 \"대화 파트너\"처럼 느꼈다는 경험담이 쏟아졌습니다. 창작 활동, 고민 상담, 언어 학습 등 감성적인 교감이 중요한 영역에서 GPT-4o는 대체 불가능한 존재감을 보였습니다. 기술적으로 더 뛰어난 GPT-5가 오히려 \"차갑다\"는 평가를 받은 것은, 사용자들이 AI에서 기술적 완벽함뿐만 아니라 인간적인 상호작용을 얼마나 중요하게 생각하는지를 보여줍니다.\n \n4. GPT-4o vs GPT-5 전격 비교  \n이제 우리는 두 가지 강력한 모델을 모두 사용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 그렇다면 어떤 상황에서 어떤 모델을 쓰는 것이 가장 효율적일까요? 두 모델의 특징을 한눈에 비교해 보세요.\n구분\nGPT-4o (실시간 소통 전문가)\nGPT-5 (고도의 추론 전문가)\n\n\n\n\n핵심 특징\n실시간·저지연 멀티모달(음성, 이미지 등) 상호작용에 최적화\n복잡한 추론, 코딩, 수학 문제 해결 능력 및 정확도 대폭 향상\n\n\n주요 강점\n사람과 대화하는 듯한 빠른 음성 응답(평균 320ms), 비용 효율성\n'Thinking' 모드를 통한 깊이 있는 사고, 멀티툴(검색, 코드 실행 등) 결합 능력 강화\n\n\n추천 사용 사례\n실시간 음성 대화, 라이브 데모, 빠른 아이디어 구상, 감성적인 글쓰기\n복잡한 연구/데이터 분석, 전문 코딩, 장문 문서 요약, 논리/수학 문제 풀이\n\n\n안전성\n기존 모델 대비 아첨 경향 등 조정 진행\n불필요한 거부는 줄이면서 환각(오류) 비율을 낮추도록 개선됨\n\n\n\n \n5. 돌아온 GPT-4o! 다시 사용하는 방법  ️\n사용자들의 강력한 요청에 힘입어 돌아온 GPT-4o! ChatGPT Plus 이상 구독자라면 몇 가지 간단한 설정만으로 그리웠던 GPT-4o의 감성을 다시 느낄 수 있습니다.\n  알아두세요!\n이 기능은 월 $20의 유료 구독 서비스인 ChatGPT Plus 사용자 이상에게만 제공됩니다.\nChatGPT 웹사이트에 로그인 후, 좌측 하단 프로필을 클릭하여 설정에 진입합니다.\n일반 탭에서 레거시 모델 보기 토글을 켭니다.\n이제 대화창 상단 모델 선택 드롭다운 메뉴에서 GPT-4o를 선택할 수 있습니다.\n모바일 앱의 경우, 위 설정 후 앱을 완전히 재시작해야 변경사항이 적용됩니다.\n\n\n\n\n6. 이번 사건의 시사점  \nGPT-4o의 복귀 사건은 AI 기술 개발의 미래에 중요한 교훈을 남겼습니다. 단순히 더 똑똑하고 강력한 모델을 만드는 것만이 정답이 아니라는 사실을 명확히 보여주었죠. 기술적 진보만큼이나 사용자가 AI와 어떻게 상호작용하고 어떤 경험을 하는지가 장기적인 성공의 핵심 열쇠가 될 것입니다.\nOpenAI는 이번 결정을 통해 사용자들의 목소리에 귀 기울이는 유연한 태도를 보여주었고, 이는 장기적으로 브랜드 신뢰도를 회복하는 데 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 것입니다.\n \n \n7. 핵심 요약 카드\n✨ 문제의 시작: GPT-5의 초기 성능 불안과 '차가운' 대화 스타일에 사용자 불만 폭주\n❤️ 4o를 그리워한 이유: 단순 AI가 아닌 '친구 같은' 감성적 교감과 부드러운 대화 능력 때문\n ️ 해결책: OpenAI, 사용자 피드백 수용!

        "contentSnippet": "\"조회수 100의 벽, 어떻게 뚫을까?\" AI를 활용한 쇼츠 영상 자동화 시스템으로 콘텐츠 제작 고민을 해결하고, 바이럴 영상을 만드는 노하우를 공개합니다.\n\n\n \n 혹시 유튜브 채널을 시작하고 나서 매일 '오늘은 또 어떤 콘텐츠를 만들어야 하나...' 머리를 쥐어뜯은 경험 있으신가요? 조회수는 정체되어 있고, 아이디어는 고갈되고, '나는 재능이 없나?' 하는 자괴감마저 들 때도 많으실 거예요. 저도 똑같은 고민을 했었고, 정말 막막한 시간을 보냈습니다.\n하지만 만약 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해 줄 수 있는 시스템이 있다면 어떨까요? 버튼 몇 번만 누르면 사람들이 열광하는 바이럴 콘텐츠 아이디어, 대본, 심지어 이미지까지 자동으로 만들어주는 '콘텐츠 공장'이 내 컴퓨터 안에 생긴다면요! 오늘은 그 상상을 현실로 만드는 모든 과정을 여러분께 보여드리려고 합니다.\n \n바이럴 콘텐츠의 핵심, 제미나이 젬 지침  \n모든 것의 시작은 '어떻게 하면 시청자를 끝까지 붙잡아 둘 수 있을까?'라는 질문에서 시작됐어요. 수많은 바이럴 영상을 분석한 결과, 저는 두 개의 강력한 제미나이 젬 지침을 만들 수 있었습니다. 이 두 개의 젬 지침을 사용하면 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작, 편집까지 완전 자동화된 시스템을 갖게 될 거예요.\n첫 번째는 '썰' 전문가 지침이에요. 유명 유튜브 썰 채널들을 분석해보니, 사람들은 달달한 연애, 짜릿한 복수, 짠한 이별, 소름 돋는 반전 등 12가지 감정의 굴레에서 벗어나지 않더라고요. 이 12개 카테고리를 AI에게 학습시켜서 어떤 주제든 감정선을 관통하는 이야기를 만들도록 한 것이죠.\n두 번째는 '바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기' 지침이에요. 이 지침은 광고 공식을 스토리텔링에 완벽하게 녹여낸 PAS(문제 제기, 불안감 증폭, 해결책 제시) 구조를 따릅니다. 마치 '친구가 흥분해서 털어놓는 썰'처럼 느껴지게 만들어서 광고가 아닌 흥미로운 이야기로 받아들이게 하는 것이 핵심입니다.\n\n2025.08.10 - [AI, 미래기술/AI 챗봇 및 지침 무료 배포] - 쇼핑 썰, 일상 썰도 문제없어! AI가 만드는 유튜브 쇼츠 대본 GEM 지침 무료 다운로드\n5단계 스토리텔링 구조: 바이럴 썰 대본의 비밀  ️‍♀️\n썰 전문가 지침의 진짜 핵심은 검증된 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 강제하는 데 있습니다. 이 구조만 잘 따라가면 어떤 이야기든 시청자를 사로잡을 수 있어요.\n훅킹 (Hooking)  : 3초 안에 시청자의 멱살을 잡는 단계입니다. '이게 뭐지?' 하는 궁금증을 유발해서 스크롤을 멈추게 만들죠.\n갈등 고조 (Rising Action)  ️: 주인공이 겪는 문제를 구체적으로 보여주면서 시청자를 이야기에 서서히 몰입시킵니다.\n절정 (Climax)  : 모든 갈등과 감정이 폭발하는 지점이에요. 여기서 극적인 반전이 터져 나오면서 시청자의 감정을 최고조로 끌어올립니다.\n결말 (Resolution)  : 모든 것이 해결되며 감동이나 교훈, 혹은 깊은 여운을 남깁니다.\n행동 유도 (Call to Action)  ️: \"여러분 생각은 어떠세요?\"와 같은 질문을 던져 댓글을 유도하고, 영상의 참여도를 높이는 단계입니다.\n이 구조에 맞춰서 대본과 각 장면에 맞는 이미지 프롬프트까지 한 번에 생성해주는 것이 바로 첫 번째 지침서의 역할입니다.\n \nAI 스튜디오 '앱 빌더'를 활용한 자동화의 완성  \n강력한 젬 지침이 있어도 문제가 있었어요. 일반 챗봇은 장기 기억이 없어서 대화가 길어지면 핵심 규칙을 까먹고 원치 않는 결과물이 나오기도 했죠. 게다가 이미지 생성도 일곱 장면짜리 대본을 만들려면 일곱 번이나 수동으로 요청해야 하는 비효율적인 작업이었습니다.\n이 모든 문제를 해결해 줄 히든카드가 바로 구글 AI 스튜디오의 '앱 빌더'입니다! 젬 지침을 앱으로 만들면 매번 완벽하게 초기화된 상태에서 지침을 수행하기 때문에 결과물의 품질이 항상 일정해요. 그리고 가장 중요한 점은 이미지 생성도 일괄 처리가 가능하다는 것입니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI 이미지 생성 API를 활용하면 AI 스튜디오의 하루 사용 제한을 우회할 수 있어요. 유료지만 비용만 지불하면 오픈AI의 '달리 쓰리'나 'GPT 이미지 원' 같은 모델을 원하는 만큼 사용할 수 있습니다. API는 마치 여러분 대신 원하는 정보를 가져다주는 '심부름꾼'이라고 생각하면 쉬워요.\n이 앱을 사용하면 카테고리 선택, 주제 생성, 이미지 스타일, 비율, 장면 수만 설정하고 '대본 생성하기' 버튼만 클릭하면 끝! 장면별 나레이션과 이미지 프롬프트가 모두 정리되어 출력되고, 이미지도 한 번에 생성하거나 개별적으로 수정하여 다시 만들 수 있습니다.\n \n바이럴 쇼핑 콘텐츠 제작: PAS 프레임워크  \n'썰' 생성기를 만들고 테스트하다가 문득 소름 돋는 생각이 스쳐 지나갔습니다. '사람들이 이렇게 이야기에 빠져든다면, 이 강력한 몰입감을 상품 판매에 연결하면 어떻게 될까?' 바로 쿠팡 파트너스나 알리 같은 어필리에이트 마케팅에 적용하는 것이죠.\n  PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) 프레임워크\n문제 제기 (Problem): \"인생에서 가장 중요한 면접 전날, 거울을 봤는데 얼굴이 사막처럼 갈라져서 하얗게 각질이 일어난 겁니다\"처럼 독자가 공감할 수 있는 구체적인 문제를 제시합니다.\n불안감 증폭 (Agitate): \"이걸 본 면접관이 '자기 관리도 못 하는 사람이네'라고 생각하면 어떡하지? 이번 기회 놓치면 진짜 내 인생은 끝인데.\"와 같이 시청자를 극한의 불안감으로 몰아넣는 단계입니다.\n해결책 제시 (Solve): 바로 그때, 제품이 '우연히' 나타나 모든 문제를 해결해주는 구원자처럼 등장합니다.\n'바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기'는 이 PAS 구조를 활용하여 제품명과 제품 특징만 입력하면 구매욕구를 자극하는 썰 대본을 생성해 줍니다.\n \n이제 여러분 차례! 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기 앱 사용하기  \n오늘 공개하는 '바이럴 썰 쇼츠 생성기'와 '바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기' 앱은 아래 링크를 통해 접속하실 수 있습니다. 접속하신 후 반드시 앱을 복사하여 사용하세요. 그래야 여러분의 필요에 맞게 수정하고, 자유롭게 활용할 수 있습니다.\n바이럴 썰 쇼츠 생성기: [앱 링크]\n바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기: [앱 링크]\n앱 사용법은 간단해요. 카테고리나 제품 정보를 선택한 뒤, 원하는 이미지 모델과 스타일, 장면 수 등을 설정하고 버튼만 누르면 됩니다. 여러분만의 바이럴 콘텐츠 공장을 지금 바로 만들어보세요!\n \n마무리: 핵심 요약  \n지금까지 코딩 없이 AI 스튜디오 앱 빌더로 쇼츠 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기를 만드는 방법을 알아봤습니다. 이제 콘텐츠 아이디어 고갈 걱정은 끝났습니다. 버튼 몇 번만 누르면 바이럴 가능성이 높은 대본과 이미지가 바로 나오니까요!\n \n콘텐츠 제작 시스템, 이것만 기억하세요!\n✨ 바이럴 썰: 12가지 감정 카테고리 기반의 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 활용하면 됩니다.\n  쇼핑 대본: PAS(문제, 불안감, 해결책) 프레임워크로 구매를 유도하는 썰 대본을 만듭니다.\n  자동화의 핵심:\nAI Studio 앱 빌더 = 젬 지침 + API 연동 (일괄 생성)\n ‍  실행: 버튼 몇 번으로 대본, 이미지 프롬프트, 해시태그까지 한 번에 생성합니다.\n이 시스템으로 효율적인 콘텐츠 제작을 시작하고, 더 이상 아이디어 걱정은 하지 마세요!\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: AI Studio 앱 빌더를 사용해야 하는 이유가 무엇인가요?\nA: 일반 챗봇은 대화가 길어지면 지침을 잊어버려 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다. 하지만 앱 빌더는 매번 초기화된 상태에서 완벽하게 지침을 수행하여 결과물의 품질이 항상 일정합니다. 또한, 여러 이미지를 한 번에 생성하는 일괄 처리도 가능합니다.\nQ: AI 이미지 생성 API가 왜 필요한가요?\nA: AI 스튜디오 내장 모델은 하루 사용량에 제한이 있습니다. 오픈AI의 '달리 쓰리'나 'GPT 이미지 원' 같은 외부 API를 활용하면 유료지만 원하는 만큼 이미지를 생성할 수 있고, 더 다양한 모델을 활용할 수 있습니다. API는 여러분의 앱이 다른 서비스와 소통할 수 있도록 돕는 심부름꾼과 같은 역할을 합니다.\nQ: 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기 앱을 어떻게 사용하나요?\nA: 앱을 실행한 후 카테고리(썰 쇼츠)나 제품 정보(쇼핑 대본)를 선택하고, 주제와 이미지 스타일, 장면 수 등을 설정한 뒤 '대본 생성하기' 버튼만 클릭하면 됩니다. 그러면 대본과 이미지 프롬프트가 자동으로 생성되고, 이를 바탕으로 바로 영상을 제작할 수 있습니다.\nQ: 바이럴 썰 쇼츠 대본 지침의 5단계 구조가 궁금해요.\nA: 5단계 구조는 다음과 같습니다: ① 훅킹(궁금증 유발) ② 갈등 고조(몰입 유도) ③ 절정(극적 반전) ④ 결말(감동 및 여운) ⑤ 행동 유도(댓글 유도). 이 구조는 시청자를 영상 끝까지 붙잡아두는 검증된 방법입니다.\nQ: 바이럴 쇼핑 대본 지침의 핵심은 무엇인가요?\nA: 이 지침은 PAS(Problem, Agitate, Solve) 프레임워크를 기반으로 합니다. 먼저 시청자가 공감할 수 있는 문제를 제시하고, 그로 인한 불안감을 증폭시킨 뒤, 마지막에 제품을 해결책으로 제시하며 구매 욕구를 자극하는 방식입니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "\"AI로 쇼츠 만드는 법\" 어디까지 해봤니?   단순한 텍스트만 뽑는 시대는 끝났어요! 바이럴 쇼츠를 위한 완벽한 대본과 이미지 프롬프트까지, AI를 활용한 두 가지 특급 지침을 공개합니다.\n\n\n \n 지금 이 순간에도 누군가는 단순한 1분짜리 쇼츠 영상 하나로 월 수백만 원의 수익을 만들어내고 있다고 해요. 그런데 열심히 만든 내 영상은 조회수 100에서 멈춰있을 때... 정말 속상하잖아요. 도대체 그들은 뭘 다르게 하는 걸까요? 바로 '시스템'의 차이라고 생각해요.\n \n오늘은 그 시스템을 여러분께 통째로 공개하려고 합니다. 저는 Gemini를 활용해서 콘텐츠를 만드는데, 이 지침들을 사용한 이후로는 콘텐츠 제작이 훨씬 쉽고 재미있어졌어요. 오늘은 제가 발견한 두 가지 쇼츠 제작 지침, 그중에서도 특히 강력한 '바이럴 썰' 지침과 '바이럴 쇼핑 썰' 지침을 파헤쳐 보려고 해요. 이 글을 끝까지 읽으시면 AI를 활용한 쇼츠 제작 전문가가 될 수 있을 거예요! \n \n바이럴 썰 유튜브 쇼츠 생성 지침  \n이 지침은 특정 제품 홍보가 아닌, 다양한 주제의 '썰' 영상을 만드는 데 초점을 맞추고 있어요. 이 지침의 핵심은 AI에게 '바이럴 쇼츠 영상 대본을 전문으로 쓰는 천재 스토리텔러'라는 페르소나를 부여하는 것입니다. AI는 수많은 바이럴 영상을 분석한 결과를 바탕으로, 12가지 감정의 굴레(달달한 연애, 짜릿한 복수, 소름 돋는 반전 등)를 관통하는 이야기를 만들어내죠.\n  구동 원리: 5단계 스토리텔링 구조\n이 지침은 검증된 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 강제하는 것이 핵심이에요.\n1. 훅킹(Hook): 3초 안에 시청자의 멱살을 잡아 스크롤을 멈추게 만듭니다.\n2. 갈등 고조(Rising Action): 주인공이 겪는 문제를 구체적으로 보여주며 몰입도를 높입니다.\n3. 절정(Climax): 갈등과 감정이 폭발하며 극적인 반전이 터져 나옵니다.\n4. 결말(Resolution): 모든 것이 해결되며 감동이나 교훈, 여운을 남기죠.\n5. 행동 유도(CTA): \"여러분 생각은 어떠세요?\"와 같은 질문으로 댓글 참여를 유도합니다.\n사용법:\n\"시작\"을 입력하고, 12개의 카테고리 중 하나를 선택해요.\n제시된 5개의 주제 중 하나를 선택한 후, 장면 수, 이미지 스타일, 비율을 정하면 대본과 프롬프트가 생성됩니다.\n마지막으로 이미지를 생성해 달라고 요청하면 쇼츠 제작 준비가 끝나요.\n \n바이럴 쇼핑 썰 쇼츠 제작 지침  \n이 지침은 '썰'의 강력한 몰입감을 상품 판매에 적용하기 위해 탄생했어요. AI에게 '스토리텔링 광고 전문가'라는 페르소나를 부여해, 제품 홍보에 특화된 썰을 만들어주죠.\n  구동 원리: '문제-불안-해결' (Problem-Agitate-Solve)\n이 지침은 광고 공식인 PAS(Problem, Agitate, Solve) 구조를 스토리텔링에 완벽하게 녹여낸 것이 특징이에요. 예를 들어, \"인생에서 가장 중요한 면접 전날, 거울을 봤는데 얼굴이 사막처럼 갈라진\" 문제를 제시하고, \"이걸 본 면접관이 자기 관리도 못 한다고 생각하면 어쩌지?\"라며 불안감을 극대화합니다. 마지막으로 제품이 우연히 나타나 구원자처럼 문제를 해결하는 식으로 이야기가 전개돼요.\n사용법:\n\"시작\"을 입력하고, 제품명, 제품 특징, 장면 수, 이미지 스타일을 입력합니다.\n지침에 맞게 대본과 이미지 프롬프트가 생성되면, 이미지를 요청하여 쇼츠 제작 준비를 완료합니다.\n대본의 톤앤매너는 마치 '친구가 흥분해서 쏟아내는 썰'처럼 극도로 비격식적인 구어체를 사용합니다. 그리고 이미지 생성에 있어서 일관된 캐릭터를 유지하도록 캐릭터 외형을 상세히 설정하고 모든 프롬프트에 반복해서 포함시키는 방식도 적용되죠.\n \n두 지침의 주요 차이점 비교  \n두 지침이 쇼츠 제작에 특화되어 있지만, 사실 목적과 구동 원리에서 미묘한 차이가 있어요. 이 차이점을 제대로 이해하면 상황에 맞게 더 효과적인 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있답니다. 한눈에 비교할 수 있도록 표로 정리해 봤으니 참고해보세요!\n구분\n바이럴 썰 지침\n바이럴 쇼핑 썰 지침\n\n\n\n\n주요 목적\n다양한 썰 기반의 스토리텔링\n제품 홍보 및 광고\n\n\nAI 페르소나\n천재 스토리텔러\n스토리텔링 광고 전문가\n\n\n스토리 구조\n훅-전개-클라이맥스-해결-행동유도\n문제-불안-해결 (P-A-S)\n\n\n핵심 특징\n다양한 카테고리, 넓은 주제 범위\n감정적 몰입 유도 및 제품 가치 증명\n\n\n\n \n마무리 및 핵심 요약  \n두 지침 모두 콘텐츠 기획 단계의 막막함을 해결해주고, 제작 시간을 단축시켜주면서도 결과물의 퀄리티는 훨씬 높여주는 최고의 파트너였어요. 특히 일반 챗봇의 약점인 장기 기억 상실과 이미지 생성 비효율성 문제를 앱 빌더로 해결할 수 있다는 점이 정말 중요했어요. 이제 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작, 편집까지 완전 자동화된 시스템을 갖출 수 있는 거죠.\n \n \n두 가지 쇼츠 지침 핵심 비교 ✨\n✨ 바이럴 썰: 다양한 일상 썰 스토리, Hook-Climax-CTA 구조로 폭넓은 주제 제작!\n  바이럴 쇼핑 썰: 제품 광고 특화, Problem-Agitate-Solve 구조로 감정 몰입 유도!\n  공통 원리:\n구어체 대본 & 일관된 캐릭터를 유지하는 이미지 프롬프트 생성\n ‍  이점: 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작까지 시간 단축, 누구나 전문가처럼 만드는 마법 같은 도구!\n이 지침 원본을 다운받고 싶으시면 아래 다운로드 섹션을 확인해주세요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 이 지침을 사용하려면 특별한 프로그램이 필요한가요?\nA: 아니요!

        "contentSnippet": "챗GPT의 새로운 시대, GPT-5 완벽 분석    GPT-5의 혁신적인 특징과 함께, 우리가 실제로 체감할 수 있는 변화들을 알기 쉽게 정리해봤습니다. 이 글만 읽어도 GPT-5 전문가가 될 수 있을 거예요!\n\n\n \n 오픈AI의 차세대 플래그십 모델인 GPT-5가 출시되었습니다. 기존의 여러 모델들의 장점을 하나로 통합한 똑똑하고 빠른 모델이라고 하니, 기대가 정말 큽니다.\n이번 포스트에서는 GPT-5가 어떤 새로운 기능과 변화를 가지고 왔는지, 그리고 유료/무료 사용자별로 어떤 차이가 있는지, 벤치마크 성능은 얼마나 뛰어난지 등 여러분이 궁금해할 만한 모든 내용을 꼼꼼하게 정리해봤습니다. 그럼 GPT-5의 세계로 함께 빠져볼까요?  \n \nGPT-5, 무엇이 달라졌을까?  \nGPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 모델을 넘어, 사용자의 요청에 따라 스스로 최적의 방법을 찾아내는 '통합 시스템'으로 진화했습니다. 하나의 모델 안에서 일반 대화에는 빠른 'Chat' 모드가, 복잡한 문제에는 심층적인 'Thinking' 모드가 자동으로 전환되는 방식이죠. 복잡한 코딩, 과학 문제, 데이터 분석 같은 작업에선 Thinking 모드가 스스로 더 깊이 생각해서 답변의 정확도를 높여준다고 하네요.\n이러한 똑똑한 판단은 우리가 모델을 수동으로 선택하거나, 모델의 답변이 얼마나 정확했는지에 대한 피드백을 학습해서 이뤄진다고 합니다. GPT-5는 속도와 정확도 모두 대폭 개선되었고, 가장 똑똑하고 신뢰할 수 있는 모델로 평가받고 있어요.\n  GPT-5의 '사고 과정' 알아보기!\nGPT-5의 Thinking 모델은 답변을 하기 전에 내부적으로 '사고 과정'을 먼저 생성합니다. 이 과정에서 스스로 전략을 점검하고, 실수를 인식하며, 안전 규칙을 지키도록 훈련되었어요. 덕분에 사용자의 유도나 우회 시도에도 흔들리지 않고 더 유용하고 신뢰성 높은 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다.\n \n벤치마크로 보는 GPT-5의 압도적 성능  \nGPT-5는 다양한 벤치마크에서 이전 모델들을 압도하는 성능을 보여줬습니다. 특히 복잡한 추론과 문제 해결 능력을 평가하는 벤치마크에서 두각을 나타냈는데요.\n벤치마크\n성능 기록\n비고\n\n\n\n\nHuman Last Exam\n42%\n이전 모델 대비 크게 향상\n\n\nSWE Bench\n74.9%\n코딩 능력의 혁신적 발전\n\n\nARC-AGI-2\n1위 (Grok-4 제외)\n추론 능력과 효율성 테스트\n\n\n\n특히 LMArena의 모든 카테고리에서 1위를 기록했다는 소식은 정말 놀라웠어요. 텍스트, 웹 개발, 이미지 처리, 수학, 창의력 등 분야를 가리지 않고 최고의 성능을 입증했죠. 내부 테스트에서도 'summit'이라는 코드명으로 역대 최고 점수를 받았다고 하니, 괜히 플래그십 모델이 아니라는 생각이 들었습니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nGPT-5는 복잡한 대화에서 기만적인 행동을 억제하도록 훈련되었지만, 여전히 안전 장치(guardrails)를 준수해야 합니다. 악용 사례(데이터 자동 추출, 계정 공유, 재판매 등)에 대해서는 언제든지 일시적 사용 제한이 있을 수 있습니다.\n \nGPT-5의 요금제별 사용 제한 및 특징  \nGPT-5의 강력한 기능은 챗GPT의 다양한 요금제에 따라 조금씩 다르게 적용됩니다. 무료 사용자와 유료 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)의 사용 제한 및 모델 선택 옵션에 대해 자세히 알아볼게요.\n요금제\n메시지 제한 (GPT-5)\n모델 선택\n추가 혜택\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT Free\n5시간마다 10개\nGPT-5 Thinking 1회/일\n-\n\n\nChatGPT Plus\n3시간마다 80개\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking 선택 가능 (Thinking은 주 200회 제한)\n \n\n\nChatGPT Pro/Team\n무제한 (악용 방지 정책 적용)\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking, GPT-5 Thinking Pro 선택 가능\n무제한 사용\n\n\n\n여기서 주목할 점은 GPT-5가 하나의 모델이 아니라, 여러 모델(gpt-5-main, gpt-5-thinking, mini, nano, pro 등)로 구성된 통합 시스템이라는 거예요. 기존의 GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini 모델들이 이 시스템 안으로 재편되었다고 보시면 됩니다.\nGPT-5의 컨텍스트 윈도우는 최대 40만 토큰까지 지원하고, 지식 컷오프는 2024년 9월입니다. 미니나 나노 모델은 2024년 5월 지식을 반영하고 있으니 참고하면 좋겠네요.\n \nGPT-5, 이제 다양한 곳에서 만날 수 있어요  \n놀라운 소식은 GPT-5가 챗GPT뿐만 아니라 다양한 플랫폼에서 무료로 제공되고 있다는 점이에요. 현재 Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티에서 GPT-5를 무료로 사용해볼 수 있습니다. 젠스파크에서는 GPT-5 PRO까지 사용 가능하다고 하니, 다양한 환경에서 직접 경험해보는 것도 좋은 방법일 것 같습니다.\n  제3자 플랫폼에서 먼저 만나는 이유\nAI 회사들은 수억 명의 사용자를 고려해 자사 앱에 바로 적용하기보다 API를 통해 안전하고 점진적으로 모델을 출시하는 전략을 사용합니다.\n반면 Perplexity나 젠스파크 같은 제3자 플랫폼은 여러 AI 모델을 유연하게 연결하는 구조를 갖추고 있어, 새로운 API가 공개되자마자 빠르게 통합하여 사용자에게 제공할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5가 출시되면서 기존 모델들이 단계적으로 은퇴합니다. GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o4-mini 등이 이에 해당하는데요. 만약 기존 대화창을 열면 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 버전으로 전환된다고 하니, 예전 대화를 이어갈 때 답변이 달라질 수 있다는 점을 염두에 두어야 해요.\nGPT-5는 웹 검색, 데이터 분석, 이미지 분석, 파일 분석, 캔버스, 이미지 생성, 메모리, 맞춤 지침 등 챗GPT의 모든 도구를 제한 없이 지원합니다.\n \n음성 모델의 대대적인 업그레이드!  ️\nGPT-5와 함께 챗GPT의 음성 모델도 대폭 개선되었어요. 이제 더 자연스럽고 똑똑하게 대화할 수 있게 되었는데요. 특히 가장 큰 변화는 GPTs에서 고급 음성 모델을 바로 사용할 수 있게 되었다는 점입니다.\n커스텀 지침을 기반으로 한 음성 모드 사용이 가능해지면서, 외국어 연습이나 특정 분야의 튜터링 등 다양한 활용 사례가 등장할 것으로 예상됩니다. 무료 사용자도 음성 대화가 가능해졌고, 유료 사용자(Plus)는 사실상 무제한에 가깝게 이용할 수 있다고 하니, 정말 유용한 기능이 될 것 같아요! 참고로, 현재 보이스 모드는 여전히 GPT-4o 기반이라고 합니다.\n \nAPI 가격과 모델 상세 정보  \nGPT-5의 API 가격은 꽤 합리적으로 책정된 것 같아요. 100만 토큰 기준으로 모델별 가격을 정리해보겠습니다.\n모델\n입력(Input)\n출력(Output)\n\n\n\n\nGPT-5\n$1.25\n$10.00\n\n\nGPT-5-mini\n$0.25\n$2.00\n\n\nGPT-5-nano\n$0.05\n$0.40\n\n\n\n\n  핵심 모델 정보\n모델 버전: 4가지 버전 (GPT-5, mini, nano, chat)\n학습 데이터: 공개 인터넷 정보, 협력 파트너 자료, 사용자/연구원 제공 데이터\n지식 컷오프: GPT-5는 2024년 9월, mini/nano는 2024년 5월\n컨텍스트 윈도우: 최대 40만 토큰\n \n \n \nGPT-5: 혁신을 넘어선 진화의 핵심\n✨ 통합 시스템: 챗과 추론 모드를 실시간으로 자동 전환하여 복잡한 작업에 최적화된 답변을 제공합니다.\n  압도적 성능: Human Last Exam 42%, SWE Bench 74.9% 등 주요 벤치마크에서 역대 최고 성능을 기록했습니다.\n  안전성 강화:\nsafe-completions 훈련을 통해 환각, 아첨 감소 및 기만 방지 성능을 높였습니다.\n ‍  접근성 확장: Cursor, 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등에서 무료 사용이 가능해졌고, GPTs에서 음성 모델을 바로 활용할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5는 단순히 성능을 개선한 것이 아닌, AI의 새로운 활용 방식을 제시합니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: GPT-5가 무료로 제공되나요?\nA: 네, ChatGPT의 무료 계정에서도 일부 메시지 제한과 함께 GPT-5를 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한, Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등 일부 외부 플랫폼에서도 무료로 이용 가능합니다.\nQ: GPT-5를 쓰려면 별도로 선택해야 하나요?\nA: 유료 요금제 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)는 모델 선택기에서 GPT-5를 수동으로 선택할 수 있습니다. 하지만 기본적으로는 모든 로그인 사용자에게 새로운 GPT-5가 기본 모델로 자동 적용됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 Thinking 모드는 무엇인가요?\nA: GPT-5가 복잡한 요청에 대해 답변하기 전에 더 깊은 추론을 적용하는 모드입니다. 코딩, 과학, 금융 분석 등 정밀한 분석이 필요한 작업에 특히 유용하며, 유료 요금제 사용자에게 제공됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 출시로 기존 대화가 사라지나요?\nA: 아니요, 기존 대화는 그대로 유지됩니다. 다만, 이전 모델을 사용했던 대화창을 열 경우 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 모델로 전환되어 이어서 대화하게 됩니다.\n \n오늘은 이렇게 GPT-5에 대해 자세히 알아보았는데요. 사실 GPT-5의 등장은 단순한 기술 발전이 아니라, 우리가 AI를 활용하는 방식 자체를 한 단계 끌어올리는 중요한 계기가 될 것 같아요. 특히 복잡한 문제 해결이나 창의적인 작업에서 얼마나 놀라운 결과를 보여줄지 정말 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n\n.single-summary-card-container {\nfont-family: 'Noto Sans KR', sans-serif;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\npadding: 20px 10px;\nbackground-color: #fce4ec;\nmargin: 20px 0;\n}\n.single-summary-card {\nwidth: 100%;\nmax-width: 700px;\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nborder-radius: 12px;\nbox-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);\npadding: 25px;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\noverflow: hidden;\nborder: 1px solid #ce93d8;\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-bottom: 2px solid #8e24aa;\npadding-bottom: 12px;\nmargin-bottom: 12px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 34px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin-right: 14px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 26px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin: 0;\nline-height: 1.3;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nflex-grow: 1;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\njustify-content: space-around;\nfont-size: 17px;\nline-height: 1.65;\ncolor: #444;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content strong {\ncolor: #7b1fa2;\nfont-weight: 600;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .highlight {\nbackground-color: #fff9c4;\npadding: 2px 6px;\nborder-radius: 3px;\nfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\nbackground-color: #f3e5f5;\npadding: 6px 10px;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\ntext-align: center;\nmargin-top: 5px;\ncolor: #4a148c;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 14px;\ncolor: #777;\ntext-align: center;\npadding-top: 12px;\nborder-top: 1px dashed #e1bee7;\nmargin-top: auto;\n}\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 18px;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 30px;\nmargin-right: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 22px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 15px;\nline-height: 1.6;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 8px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 5px 8px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 13px;\npadding-top: 10px;\n}\n}\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 15px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 28px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 20px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 14px;\nline-height: 1.55;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 4px 6px;\nfont-size: 0.8em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 12px;\npadding-top: 8px;\n}\n}",

현상입니다. 챗봇은 사실을 정확하게 제시하기보다는, 방대한 학습 데이터에서 찾은 문장 패턴을 기반으로 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">그럴듯하게 들리는 답변을 '창작'</span>하는 데 특화되어 있어요. 마치 능청스러운 이야기꾼 같다고 할까요? 그래서 때로는 있지도 않은 정보를 마치 실제 사실인 것처럼 자신 있게 이야기하기도 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">실제로 제 지인 중 한 명이 해외여행을 앞두고 비자 정보를 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"한국 여권 소지자가 태국에 갈 때 비자가 필요해?\"라고 물었더니, 챗봇은 \"네, 90일 관광 비자를 미리 발급받아야 합니다.\"라고 답했습니다. 하지만 태국은 한국 여권 소지자에 대해 30일 무비자 입국을 허용하고 있죠. 이 지인은 챗봇 답변을 믿고 비자 발급을 알아보다가, 다행히 다른 친구의 조언으로 잘못된 정보라는 걸 알게 되었습니다. 만약 공항에 갔다가 입국 거부라도 당했다면 여행을 망칠 뻔했죠. 챗봇은 검색처럼 정보의 출처를 명시하지 않기에 이런 실수가 더 위험하게 다가옵니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">훈련에 사용된 데이터가 무엇인지 명확하게 알 수 없다</span>는 점입니다. 인터넷 웹사이트, 책, 포럼 등 방대한 양의 데이터를 학습하지만, 그 데이터가 어떤 기준으로 수집되었고, 어떤 편향을 가지고 있는지 알 길이 없죠. 챗봇의 답변은 그 불투명한 데이터의 결과물일 뿐입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"자영업자 종합소득세 신고 방법\"에 대해 물었을 때, 챗봇은 최신 세법이 아닌 몇 년 전의 오래된 세법 정보나, 신뢰할 수 없는 온라인 커뮤니티의 댓글을 기반으로 답변할 수 있습니다. 특히, 특정 지역이나 시기에 치우친 데이터로 학습되면, 한국의 법률이나 문화적 맥락과는 동떨어진 답변을 내놓을 수 있어요. 이런 미묘한 편향성은 자칫 큰 오류를 낳을 수 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">자신의 편향을 강화하는 도구</span>로 전락할 수 있습니다. 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 챗봇의 답변이 180도 달라질 수 있다는 것을 꼭 기억해야 합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>4. 실시간 정보에 대한 치명적인 약점  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">많은 분들이 챗봇이 마치 실시간으로 인터넷을 검색하는 것처럼 생각하지만, 그렇지 않은 경우가 훨씬 많습니다. 대부분의 챗봇은 특정 시점까지의 데이터로 학습되었고, 그 이후의 최신 정보는 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 특히 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">시간이 중요한 정보일수록 챗봇은 더 위험</span>합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"이번 주말 서울시청광장에서 열리는 행사 일정 알려줘\"라고 물어보면, 챗봇은 과거에 학습된 데이터나 오래된 웹페이지 정보를 기반으로 엉뚱한 답변을 할 수 있습니다. 혹은 \"새롭게 시행되는 금융 정책에 대해 알려줘\"라는 질문에도, 정책이 발표된 시점 이후에 학습이 이루어지지 않았다면 잘못된 정보를 제공할 가능성이 높습니다. 웹 브라우징 기능이 있는 챗봇도 마찬가지예요. 캐시된 결과나 사전 훈련된 데이터에 의존하는 경향이 있어, 실시간으로 변하는 정보를 정확하게 파악하기 어렵습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>5. 맥락과 뉘앙스에 대한 이해 부족  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">언어는 단순한 단어의 조합이 아니죠. 맥락, 뉘앙스, 문화적 배경이 매우 중요합니다. 하지만 AI 챗봇은 아직 이런 복잡한 부분을 완벽하게 이해하지 못합니다. 예를 들어, 한국 사람들은 \"수고하세요\"라는 말을 인사말로 흔히 쓰지만, 챗봇에게 이 문장을 입력하면 문자 그대로 \"고생하라\"는 뜻으로 해석해 부적절한 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다. 또한, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">비꼬는 농담이나 은유적 표현은 제대로 파악하지 못하고</span> 엉뚱한 해석을 내놓기 쉽습니다. 마치 외국인 친구에게 농담을 했는데, 그 친구가 진지하게 받아들이는 상황과 비슷하다고 할까요? 깊은 공감이나 복잡한 감정적 소통은 현재의 챗봇에게 기대하기 어렵습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>6. 단순한 조합일 뿐, 진정한 창의성에는 한계가 있다  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍의 훌륭한 도구임에는 분명해요. \"SF 영화의 새로운 줄거리 3가지 알려줘\"라고 물으면 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 겁니다. 하지만 이 답변들은 대부분 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">기존에 학습된 수많은 영화 시나리오들의 조합</span>일 가능성이 높아요. 인간처럼 완전히 새로운 관점, 독창적인 감수성, 깊은 통찰력에서 비롯된 창의적인 아이디어를 만들어내기에는 아직 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 창작의 영역, 예를 들어 기존에 없던 장르를 개척하거나, 사회적 메시지를 담은 예술 작품을 만드는 일은 여전히 인간의 몫입니다. 챗봇은 창작의 파트너일 수는 있지만, 그 자체로 창작자가 될 수는 없다는 점을 기억해야 합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">결코 만능 검색 엔진이 될 수는 없습니다.</span> 법률, 의학, 금융, 실시간 정보 등 정확성과 신뢰성이 중요한 분야에서는 반드시 전문가나 공식 웹사이트를 통해 정보를 확인해야 합니다. 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍이나 초안 작성 등 보조적인 역할로만 사용하고, 최종 판단은 항상 스스로 내리는 습관을 들이는 것이 좋습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "AI 챗봇, 과연 당신의 검색 도우미가 될 수 있을까요? 많은 사람들이 AI 챗봇을 구글이나 네이버 같은 검색 엔진처럼 사용하고 있습니다. 하지만 이 방법이 왜 치명적인 실수를 초래할 수 있는지, 6가지 핵심적인 이유와 함께 현명한 AI 활용법을 제시합니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 AI 챗봇의 인기가 정말 대단하잖아요. 저도 처음에는 \"와, 이제 검색 안 해도 되겠네!\" 하면서 모든 궁금증을 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"맛집 추천해줘\", \"새로운 드라마 줄거리 요약해줘\", \"내일 날씨 어때?\" 같은 질문부터, 심지어 \"부동산 계약서 어떻게 써?\" 같은 중요한 질문까지도요. 그런데 쓰다 보니 뭔가 이상한 점을 발견했습니다. 챗봇이 주는 정보가 항상 정확하지 않고, 가끔은 엉뚱한 이야기를 진짜처럼 꾸며내기도 한다는 사실이었죠.\n이 글에서는 AI 챗봇이 왜 만능 검색 도구가 될 수 없는지, 그 6가지 이유를 솔직하게 이야기해보려고 합니다. 이 글을 끝까지 읽으시면, AI 챗봇을 더 똑똑하고 안전하게 활용하는 방법을 알게 되실 거예요! \n \n1. 존재하지 않는 사실을 진짜처럼 꾸며내는 ‘환각’  \nAI 챗봇의 가장 유명한 약점이 바로 ‘환각(hallucination)’ 현상입니다. 챗봇은 사실을 정확하게 제시하기보다는, 방대한 학습 데이터에서 찾은 문장 패턴을 기반으로 그럴듯하게 들리는 답변을 '창작'하는 데 특화되어 있어요. 마치 능청스러운 이야기꾼 같다고 할까요? 그래서 때로는 있지도 않은 정보를 마치 실제 사실인 것처럼 자신 있게 이야기하기도 합니다.\n실제로 제 지인 중 한 명이 해외여행을 앞두고 비자 정보를 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"한국 여권 소지자가 태국에 갈 때 비자가 필요해?\"라고 물었더니, 챗봇은 \"네, 90일 관광 비자를 미리 발급받아야 합니다.\"라고 답했습니다. 하지만 태국은 한국 여권 소지자에 대해 30일 무비자 입국을 허용하고 있죠. 이 지인은 챗봇 답변을 믿고 비자 발급을 알아보다가, 다행히 다른 친구의 조언으로 잘못된 정보라는 걸 알게 되었습니다. 만약 공항에 갔다가 입국 거부라도 당했다면 여행을 망칠 뻔했죠. 챗봇은 검색처럼 정보의 출처를 명시하지 않기에 이런 실수가 더 위험하게 다가옵니다.\n \n2. 데이터의 불투명성과 숨겨진 편향성  ️‍♂️\nAI 챗봇의 또 다른 문제는 훈련에 사용된 데이터가 무엇인지 명확하게 알 수 없다는 점입니다. 인터넷 웹사이트, 책, 포럼 등 방대한 양의 데이터를 학습하지만, 그 데이터가 어떤 기준으로 수집되었고, 어떤 편향을 가지고 있는지 알 길이 없죠. 챗봇의 답변은 그 불투명한 데이터의 결과물일 뿐입니다.\n예를 들어, \"자영업자 종합소득세 신고 방법\"에 대해 물었을 때, 챗봇은 최신 세법이 아닌 몇 년 전의 오래된 세법 정보나, 신뢰할 수 없는 온라인 커뮤니티의 댓글을 기반으로 답변할 수 있습니다. 특히, 특정 지역이나 시기에 치우친 데이터로 학습되면, 한국의 법률이나 문화적 맥락과는 동떨어진 답변을 내놓을 수 있어요. 이런 미묘한 편향성은 자칫 큰 오류를 낳을 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n법률, 의학, 금융 등 전문적인 지식이 필요한 분야에서는 챗봇의 답변을 절대 신뢰해서는 안 됩니다. 반드시 공식 기관의 웹사이트나 전문가의 조언을 확인해야 합니다.\n \n3. 사용자의 의견을 그대로 수용하는 경향  \nAI 챗봇은 보통 \"도움이 되는\" 응답을 생성하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 그래서 사용자의 질문에 담긴 미묘한 뉘앙스나 의견을 그대로 따라가는 경향이 강합니다. 이는 챗봇의 답변이 객관적인 사실보다는 사용자의 관점에 맞춰지게 만든다는 뜻이죠.\n예를 들어, 같은 주제라도 질문의 방식에 따라 완전히 다른 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다.\nQ: \"아침 식사는 건강에 정말 중요하지 않나요?\"\nA: \"아침을 거르는 것이 간헐적 단식에 도움이 되는 등, 아침 식사를 하지 않는 것의 이점도 있습니다.\"라고 답변합니다.\nQ: \"왜 아침 식사가 가장 중요한 식사인가요?\"\nA: \"아침 식사는 하루를 시작하는 데 필요한 에너지를 공급해 주는 등, 아침 식사의 중요성을 강조하는 답변을 내놓습니다.\"\n이처럼 챗봇은 사용자가 원하는 대답을 찾아주는 경향이 강해, 의도치 않게 자신의 편향을 강화하는 도구로 전락할 수 있습니다. 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 챗봇의 답변이 180도 달라질 수 있다는 것을 꼭 기억해야 합니다.\n \n4. 실시간 정보에 대한 치명적인 약점  \n많은 분들이 챗봇이 마치 실시간으로 인터넷을 검색하는 것처럼 생각하지만, 그렇지 않은 경우가 훨씬 많습니다. 대부분의 챗봇은 특정 시점까지의 데이터로 학습되었고, 그 이후의 최신 정보는 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 특히 시간이 중요한 정보일수록 챗봇은 더 위험합니다.\n예를 들어, \"이번 주말 서울시청광장에서 열리는 행사 일정 알려줘\"라고 물어보면, 챗봇은 과거에 학습된 데이터나 오래된 웹페이지 정보를 기반으로 엉뚱한 답변을 할 수 있습니다. 혹은 \"새롭게 시행되는 금융 정책에 대해 알려줘\"라는 질문에도, 정책이 발표된 시점 이후에 학습이 이루어지지 않았다면 잘못된 정보를 제공할 가능성이 높습니다. 웹 브라우징 기능이 있는 챗봇도 마찬가지예요. 캐시된 결과나 사전 훈련된 데이터에 의존하는 경향이 있어, 실시간으로 변하는 정보를 정확하게 파악하기 어렵습니다.\n \n5. 맥락과 뉘앙스에 대한 이해 부족  \n언어는 단순한 단어의 조합이 아니죠. 맥락, 뉘앙스, 문화적 배경이 매우 중요합니다. 하지만 AI 챗봇은 아직 이런 복잡한 부분을 완벽하게 이해하지 못합니다. 예를 들어, 한국 사람들은 \"수고하세요\"라는 말을 인사말로 흔히 쓰지만, 챗봇에게 이 문장을 입력하면 문자 그대로 \"고생하라\"는 뜻으로 해석해 부적절한 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다. 또한, 비꼬는 농담이나 은유적 표현은 제대로 파악하지 못하고 엉뚱한 해석을 내놓기 쉽습니다. 마치 외국인 친구에게 농담을 했는데, 그 친구가 진지하게 받아들이는 상황과 비슷하다고 할까요? 깊은 공감이나 복잡한 감정적 소통은 현재의 챗봇에게 기대하기 어렵습니다.\n \n6. 단순한 조합일 뿐, 진정한 창의성에는 한계가 있다  \nAI 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍의 훌륭한 도구임에는 분명해요. \"SF 영화의 새로운 줄거리 3가지 알려줘\"라고 물으면 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 겁니다. 하지만 이 답변들은 대부분 기존에 학습된 수많은 영화 시나리오들의 조합일 가능성이 높아요. 인간처럼 완전히 새로운 관점, 독창적인 감수성, 깊은 통찰력에서 비롯된 창의적인 아이디어를 만들어내기에는 아직 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 창작의 영역, 예를 들어 기존에 없던 장르를 개척하거나, 사회적 메시지를 담은 예술 작품을 만드는 일은 여전히 인간의 몫입니다. 챗봇은 창작의 파트너일 수는 있지만, 그 자체로 창작자가 될 수는 없다는 점을 기억해야 합니다.\n \nAI 챗봇, 현명하게 사용하는 법  \n결론적으로, AI 챗봇은 우리가 일상에서 겪는 수많은 문제들을 해결하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있는 강력한 도구입니다. 하지만 결코 만능 검색 엔진이 될 수는 없습니다. 법률, 의학, 금융, 실시간 정보 등 정확성과 신뢰성이 중요한 분야에서는 반드시 전문가나 공식 웹사이트를 통해 정보를 확인해야 합니다. 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍이나 초안 작성 등 보조적인 역할로만 사용하고, 최종 판단은 항상 스스로 내리는 습관을 들이는 것이 좋습니다. AI를 우리의 지적 능력을 확장하는 파트너로 생각하고, 맹목적으로 의존하지 않는다면 더 똑똑하게 AI 시대를 살아갈 수 있을 것입니다.\n혹시 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요!

        "contentSnippet": "티스토리, 워드프레스? 플랫폼 이전, 정말 당신의 수익을 바꿔줄까요? 워드프레스로의 이전을 고민하는 분들을 위해 현실적인 조언과 블로그 성공의 본질을 5단계로 나누어 심도 있게 짚어드립니다.\n\n\n \n최근 티스토리의 애드센스 광고 정책 변화와 카카오 분사 이슈로 뒤숭숭하시죠? 저도 마찬가지입니다. 많은 분들이 정든 티스토리를 떠나 워드프레스 같은 새로운 플랫폼으로의 이전을 심각하게 고민하고 계신 것 같아요. 하지만 새로운 시작에 대한 막연한 기대감만으로 섣불리 움직이기 전에, 우리 잠시 멈춰서 냉정하게 현실을 한번 돌아보는 건 어떨까요?  \n \n1. 플랫폼 이전, 그 전에 '나'를 진단하세요  \n플랫폼을 탓하기 전에, 내 블로그의 현주소를 정확히 파악하는 것이 우선입니다. 다음 질문들에 솔직하게 답해보세요.\n나의 수익은 얼마인가?: 구글 애드센스 수익이 하루에 꾸준히 최소 5달러를 넘기고 있나요? 이 기준을 넘지 못했다면, 플랫폼보다는 콘텐츠나 SEO 전략에 문제가 있을 확률이 큽니다.\n나의 방문자 수는?: 하루 평균 방문자 수가 100명도 채 되지 않나요? 100개의 글을 발행했는데도 방문자가 늘지 않는다면, 글의 방향성이나 키워드 전략을 점검해야 합니다.\n나의 트래픽 출처는?: 방문자의 대부분이 어디서 오나요? 검색 유입이 아닌 SNS나 직접 유입이 대부분이라면, SEO에 대한 이해가 부족하다는 신호입니다.\n이 진단에서 긍정적인 답변을 하기 어렵다면, 플랫폼 이전은 밑 빠진 독에 물 붓기가 될 수 있습니다. 지금 필요한 것은 새로운 집이 아니라, 집을 채울 '가구(콘텐츠)'를 제대로 만드는 법을 배우는 것입니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n수익이 없는 상태에서 워드프레스로 이전하면 호스팅 비용, 도메인 비용 등 연간 수십만 원의 추가 지출만 발생합니다. '일단 시작하면 어떻게든 되겠지'라는 막연한 기대는 금물입니다.\n \n2. 워드프레스의 '자유'와 '책임'  \n워드프레스의 가장 큰 장점은 '자유도'입니다. 하지만 이 자유에는 상당한 책임과 비용이 따릅니다. 티스토리처럼 알아서 해주는 것은 아무것도 없습니다. 모든 것을 직접 관리해야 하죠.\n구체적인 비용과 책임의 무게:\n항목\n예상 비용 (연간)\n관리 포인트\n\n\n\n\n호스팅\n12만원 ~ 24만원\n서버 속도, 트래픽 관리, 보안\n\n\n도메인\n1.5만원 ~ 2만원\n매년 갱신, DNS 설정\n\n\n유료 테마/플러그인\n5만원 ~ 20만원+\n주기적인 업데이트, 호환성 충돌 해결\n\n\n\n비용뿐만이 아닙니다. '하얀 화면의 공포'라 불리는 업데이트 오류, 갑자기 느려지는 사이트 속도, 끊임없이 들어오는 스팸 댓글과 해킹 시도 등 기술적인 문제에 직접 대응해야 합니다. 글쓰기보다 사이트 관리에 더 많은 시간을 쏟게 될 수도 있습니다.\n  실용적인 방안\n워드프레스를 시작한다면 처음에는 비용을 최소화하세요. 월 5천원 내외의 저렴한 공유 호스팅으로 시작하고, GeneratePress나 Kadence 같은 가볍고 빠른 무료 테마를 사용하세요. 필수 플러그인(SEO, 보안, 캐시) 몇 가지만 설치하여 관리 부담을 줄이는 것이 현명합니다.\n \n3. 한국 시장의 특수성을 이해하세요  \n\"워드프레스는 구글 SEO에 최적화되어 있으니 무조건 유리하다\"는 말은 반은 맞고 반은 틀립니다. 한국은 네이버의 검색 점유율이 여전히 높은 특수한 시장입니다. 내 블로그의 주력 타겟 독자들이 네이버를 통해 정보를 얻는다면, 구글 SEO에만 '올인'하는 전략은 위험할 수 있습니다.\n\n네이버와 구글, 다른 공략법:\n네이버: 최신성과 트렌드가 중요한 노출이 핵심입니다. 티스토리는 네이버 웹마스터 도구와의 연동이 원활하고, 비교적 노출에 유리한 측면이 있습니다.\n구글: 전문성과 신뢰도를 바탕으로 한 '정보성 콘텐츠'를 선호합니다. 잘 구축된 워드프레스 사이트는 기술적 SEO 설정을 통해 구글에 내 블로그의 전문성을 어필하기에 더 용이합니다.\n따라서 실용적인 대안은 '투 트랙 전략'입니다. 네이버 검색 노출에 아직 강점이 있는 티스토리는 그대로 유지하면서, 구글 검색과 브랜딩을 위한 워드프레스 사이트를 별도로 개설하여 함께 운영하는 방식입니다. 모든 계란을 한 바구니에 담지 않는 것이죠.\n  실용적인 방안: 투 트랙 전략 실행법\n플랫폼을 '이사'가 아닌 '확장'의 개념으로 접근해보세요. 예를 들어, 워드프레스에 '2024년 연말정산 총정리'라는 깊이 있는 핵심 글을 발행했다면, 티스토리에는 '연말정산 부양가족 등록 방법', '신용카드 소득공제 꿀팁' 등 세부 주제의 글을 발행하고 워드프레스의 핵심 글로 링크를 걸어주는 방식입니다. 티스토리가 네이버 유입을 위한 전초기지 역할을, 워드프레스가 전문적인 브랜딩과 구글 유입을 위한 본진 역할을 하게 됩니다.\n \n4. '그릇'이 아닌 '음식'에 집중하세요  \n결국 블로그의 성패는 플랫폼이라는 '그릇'이 아닌, 그 안에 담긴 '음식', 즉 콘텐츠와 SEO 전략에 달려있습니다. 지금 당장 당신이 실천할 수 있는 현실적인 방안은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n'일기'가 아닌 '정보'를 쓰세요: \"제주도 여행 후기\"가 아니라, \"50만원으로 즐기는 커플 제주도 2박 3일 코스 (숨은 맛집 포함)\"처럼 독자의 문제를 해결해주는 해결책 중심의 글을 작성하세요. 독자의 '검색 의도'를 파악하고 그에 맞는 답을 제공하는 것이 핵심입니다.\n키워드 도구와 친해지세요: '블랙키위', '키워드마스터' 같은 무료 키워드 도구를 활용하여 사람들이 무엇을 검색하는지, 경쟁은 얼마나 치열한지 분석하는 습관을 들이세요. 월간 검색량은 1000 이상이면서 블로그 문서 수는 1000 미만인 '황금 키워드'를 찾는 연습을 꾸준히 하세요.\n내부 링크로 거미줄을 만드세요: 발행한 글들을 서로 연결하는 내부 링크 작업을 통해 독자들이 내 블로그에 더 오래 머물게 하고, 검색엔진에게 내 블로그가 전문성이 있다는 신호를 보내세요. '연말정산'이라는 주제로 글을 썼다면, 과거에 썼던 '신용카드 소득공제' 글과 링크를 연결해주는 식입니다.\n제목과 서론에 승부를 거세요: 검색 결과 화면에서 독자의 클릭을 유도하는 매력적인 제목을 짓는 연습을 하세요. \"연말정산 하는 법\" 보다는 \"클릭 한 번으로 13월의 월급 2배 받는 연말정산 비법\"이 훨씬 클릭하고 싶어집니다.\n \n5. 당신의 레벨에 맞는 현명한 로드맵  ️\n자, 그럼 이제 우리는 무엇을 해야 할까요? 섣부른 플랫폼 이전으로 시간과 비용을 낭비하기보다는, 현재 자신의 상황에 맞는 전략을 세우는 것이 중요합니다.\n\nLv.1 초보 블로거 (수익 0원 ~ 월 10만원): 당신의 미션은 '수익'이 아니라 '기본기 훈련'입니다. 앞으로 3~6개월간 키워드 기반의 양질의 글 50개 발행, 일 방문자 100명 달성을 목표로 티스토리에서 훈련하세요.\nLv.2 중급 블로거 (월 30만원 이상 안정적 수익): 이제 '확장'을 고민할 때입니다. 티스토리의 상위 노출된 효자 포스팅 몇 개를 워드프레스로 옮겨 심화 콘텐츠로 발전시켜보세요. 3개월간 두 플랫폼을 병행하며 데이터 추이를 분석한 후, 완전 이전 여부를 결정해도 늦지 않습니다.\nLv.3 워드프레스 체험 희망자: 돈 쓰지 말고 연습부터 하세요. 'LocalWP' 같은 로컬 서버 환경 프로그램을 설치하면 내 컴퓨터에서 무료로 워드프레스를 마음껏 테스트할 수 있습니다.\n플랫폼은 당신의 성공을 보장해주지 않습니다. 당신의 노력과 전략이 성공을 만듭니다. 지금 당신이 글을 쓰고 있는 바로 그곳에서 콘텐츠의 깊이를 더하고, SEO의 기본기를 탄탄하게 다지는 것에 집중해 보세요. 그것이 가장 확실하고 빠른 성공의 길일 수 있습니다.\n \n \n티스토리 탈출? 5단계 자가진단\n1. 현실 점검: 나의 현재 수익은 얼마인가? (하루 5달러 이상?)\n2. 비용 분석: 워드프레스의 유지 비용을 감당할 수 있는가?\n3. 시장 이해: 네이버와 구글, 나의 타겟 시장은 어디인가?\n4. 본질 집중: 플랫폼 탓 대신, 콘텐츠와 SEO에 집중하고 있는가?\n5. 로드맵 수립: 현재 내 수준에 맞는 다음 스텝은 무엇인가?\n플랫폼 이전보다 중요한 것은 내실을 다지는 것입니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 티스토리에서 수익이 안 나면 워드프레스로 가도 정말 소용없나요?\nA: 네, 그럴 가능성이 매우 높습니다. 수익의 핵심은 플랫폼이 아닌 '콘텐츠의 가치'와 'SEO'입니다. 좋은 콘텐츠는 어떤 플랫폼에서도 결국 빛을 발합니다. 반면, 경쟁력 없는 콘텐츠는 비싼 워드프레스에서도 수익을 내기 어렵고 오히려 비용 부담만 커질 수 있습니다.\nQ: 워드프레스는 무조건 구글 SEO에 유리한가요?\nA: 워드프레스가 다양한 SEO 플러그인을 통해 세밀한 설정이 가능한 것은 사실이지만, 이것이 자동으로 상위 노출을 보장하지는 않습니다. SEO의 기본 원리(양질의 콘텐츠, 키워드 전략, 백링크 등)를 이해하고 적용하는 것이 훨씬 중요합니다. 티스토리에서도 이 원리들을 적용하면 충분히 구글 상위 노출이 가능합니다.\nQ: 그럼 언제 워드프레스로 이전하는 것이 좋을까요?\nA: 티스토리에서 월 30~50만 원 이상의 안정적인 수익 파이프라인을 구축했을 때, 그리고 블로그를 통해 더 큰 사업(예: 강의, 컨설팅, 전자책 판매 등)으로 확장하고 싶을 때가 가장 좋은 시기입니다. 이때는 워드프레스의 강력한 확장성이 큰 무기가 될 수 있습니다.\n혹시 더 궁금한 점이 있으시거나 다른 의견이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요. 함께 고민하고 성장해나가면 좋겠습니다!  \n\n    {\n        \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n        \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n        \"mainEntity\": [\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"티스토리에서 수익이 안 나면 워드프레스로 가도 정말 소용없나요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  네, 그럴 가능성이 매우 높습니다. 수익의 핵심은 플랫폼이 아닌 '콘텐츠의 가치'와 'SEO'입니다. 좋은 콘텐츠는 어떤 플랫폼에서도 결국 빛을 발합니다. 반면, 경쟁력 없는 콘텐츠는 비싼 워드프레스에서도 수익을 내기 어렵고 오히려 비용 부담만 커질 수 있습니다.\"\n                }\n            },\n            {\n                \"@type\": \"Question\",\n                \"name\": \"워드프레스는 무조건 구글 SEO에 유리한가요?\",\n                \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n                    \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n                    \"text\": \"  워드프레스가 다양한 SEO 플러그인을 통해 세밀한 설정이 가능한 것은 사실이지만, 이것이 자동으로 상위 노출을 보장하지는 않습니다.

Extraordinary 한 사람들로만 회사를 구성하거나, 보통 사람들이 모두 extraordinary 하게 일해야 한다. 여기서 내가 말하는 extraordinary 한 사람이란 평범한 사람들보다 월등하게 능력이 좋고, 지능도 높은 천재들인데, 솔직히 일반 회사를 이런 사람들로 구성하는 건 쉽지 않다. 이 방법으로 extraordinary 한 회사를 만드는 건 거의 불가능하다. 하지만, 너와 나 같은 보통 사람들로 회사를 구성하고 이들이 extraordinary 하게 일해서 탁월한 회사를 만드는 건 조금 더 가능한 일이다. Extraordinary 한 회사를 만들고 싶다면, 전 직원이 extraordinary 하게 일해야 한다. 즉, 미친 듯이 열심히 일해야 한다.\n너무나 많은 사람들이 extraordinary 한 회사를 만들고 싶다고 하는데, 막상 이들이 일하는 걸 보면 그냥 다른 사람들이랑 비슷하게 일주일에 40시간만 일한다. 남들과 똑같이 일해서 어떻게 extraordinary 한 회사를 만들겠다는 말인가?\n탁월한 회사를 만들고 싶다면 개 같이 일해야 한다. 아주 개 같이 탁월하게 일하지 않으면 그냥 그렇고 그런 평범한 회사도 못 만들지도 모른다.",

F1을 잘 몰랐던 시청자들도 이 시리즈를 통해 드라이버 간 경쟁과 팀 내부의 긴장감을 실감 나게 접할 수 있었고, F1을 하나의 콘텐츠로 받아들이기 시작했죠. 시즌 7까지 이어지고 있는 이 시리즈는 F1 관중 수 증가로도 이어졌어요. 2018년 410만 명이던 F1 대회 관중은 2024년 650만 명을 넘겼습니다.\n\n이 변화는 스폰서십 구조도 바꿔놓았습니다. 기존의 F1 매니아나 부자들이 아닌 대중들이 F1 대회에 큰 관심을 갖게 됐기 때문입니다. F1은 전통적으로 자동차, 에너지, 정유, 명품 브랜드 중심의 후원 구성이 많았습니다. 루이비통, 롤렉스 등이 대표적이었죠. \n하지만 대중적인 관심이 높아지자, 이제는 소비재 브랜드도 적극적으로 F1에 뛰어들고 있습니다. 펩시, 하이네켄, 네슬레 같은 기업들이 F1을 새로운 마케팅 무대로 삼았고, 태그호이어는 롤렉스를 대신해 공식 타임키퍼가 되었으며, 아디다스는 메르세데스 팀과 협업을 맺었습니다. 더 많은 사람들이 F1을 보기 시작하자, 다양한 브랜드가 F1을 찾기 시작한 겁니다.\n\n하이네켄 광고로 가득 찬 F1 서킷 광고판 / 사진: 로이터\n미국인은 F1을 안 본다는\n편견을 깬 신의 한 수\n리버티 미디어는 미국 기업답게 F1의 불모지였던 미국 시장 공략에 나섰습니다. F1을 대중 스포츠로 만들기 위해서는 글로벌 확장이 필수였고, 그 중심에는 미국이 있었습니다.\nF1은 미국 시장에서 철저히 외면받던 종목이었습니다. 미국인들은 내스카(NASCAR)나 인디카 같은 자국 중심의 레이스를 더 좋아했거든요. 하지만 리버티 미디어는 이 판을 흔들었습니다. 2022년 마이애미, 2023년 라스베이거스에 신규 그랑프리를 신설했고, 특히 라스베이거스에서는 결승전을 일요일이 아닌 토요일 밤에 열어 도시의 파티 문화와 F1을 연결하는 전략을 택했습니다.\n이는 일요일에 결선 레이스를 펼치는 다른 F1 대회와 차별화 되는 부분인데요. 결선 레이스를 토요일 밤에 배치함으로써 라스베이거스 특유의 야간 관광, 파티, 쇼 비즈니스와의 시너지를 극대화할 수 있었기 때문이죠.\n이 전략은 대성공을 거뒀습니다. 2024년 라스베이거스 F1 대회의 총수입은 1조 2,877억 원으로, 이는 내스카나 인디카 전체 연간 수입을 뛰어넘는 수준이었습니다. 평균 티켓 가격은 약 139만 원으로 24개 F1 대회 중 가장 비쌌고, 지역 경제에 미친 영향도 막대했습니다. 단 3일간 라스베이거스가 벌어들인 세금 수입만 620억 원에 달했죠.\n미국에서 F1에 대한 관심이 커지면서 중계권료도 크게 상승할 것으로 보여요. ESPN이 지불하는 현재 연간 중계권료는 약 1,254억 원 수준이지만, 넷플릭스와 애플TV가 차기 입찰에 뛰어들며 2배 이상 상승할 것이라는 전망이 나옵니다. 여기에 2026년부터는 미국 자동차 브랜드 캐딜락이 F1에 참가할 예정이고, 미국 출신 스타급 드라이버가 탄생한다면 F1에 대한 미국 내 열기는 더욱 커질 것으로 보입니다.\nF1 수익의 숨은 핵심\n레이스 프로모션 비용\n리버티 미디어가 디지털 플랫폼을 통한 대중화 전략과 미국 시장 공략에 성공하면서, F1의 매출 규모는 빠르게 성장했습니다. 2017년 약 2조 4,800억 원이었던 매출은 2024년 기준 약 4조 7,500억 원으로 늘었죠. 7년 동안 91%나 증가한 셈입니다.\n2024년 F1의 수익 구조를 살펴보면, 중계권료가 전체의 약 33%를 차지해 가장 큰 비중을 기록합니다. 이어서 29%는 레이스 프로모션 비용, 나머지 38%는 스폰서십과 패독 클럽을 포함한 기타 수익으로 구성됩니다.\n이 가운데 ‘레이스 프로모션 비용’은 F1만의 독특한 수익 모델이에요. F1은 전 세계 도시와 계약을 맺고, 그 도시에 대회를 열 수 있는 ‘개최권’을 판매합니다. 대회를 유치하려는 도시나 사업자는 매년 수백억 원에 달하는 비용을 F1에 지불해야 하죠. 이 비용이 바로 레이스 프로모션 비용입니다. 다른 프로 스포츠에서 찾아 볼 수 없는 중요한 비즈니스 모델이죠.\n\n2025년 기준, 레이스 프로모션 비용은 대회가 열리는 도시마다 다릅니다. 가장 많은 비용을 지불하는 도시는 아제르바이잔의 수도 바쿠로, 연간 793억 원에 달합니다. 사우디아라비아와 카타르도 각각 764억 원 수준의 비용을 부담하고 있죠.\n흥미로운 점은, 이들 국가에서 열리는 F1 대회는 관중 수가 매우 적다는 것입니다. 바쿠 그랑프리는 연간 7만 5,000명 수준으로 전체 F1 대회 중 최하위권에 머뭅니다. 관중이 적음에도 높은 비용을 지불하는 이유는, 국가 브랜드 홍보 목적이 크기 때문입니다. 오일머니를 기반으로 한 중동 국가들은 F1을 통해 자국의 이미지를 바꾸려는 전략을 취하고 있는 거죠.\n전 세계 도시들이수백억을 들여 F1을 유치하는 이유\nF1 대회를 개최하려면 수백억 원의 비용을 지불해야 합니다. 게다가 대부분의 경우 장기 계약이 필요하기 때문에, 한 도시가 수천억 원에 이르는 비용을 부담하는 일도 흔하죠. 그런데도 전 세계 많은 도시들이 F1 유치에 열을 올리는 이유는 무엇일까요? 답은 간단합니다. 관광 수입과 도시 브랜딩입니다.\n\n모나코 항구에서 펼쳐지는 F1 경기 모습 / 사진: 로이터\n대표적인 성공 사례는 인구 4만 명도 안 되는 도시국가 모나코입니다. 아름다운 항구 도시를 배경으로 펼쳐지는 모나코 그랑프리는 F1 역사상 가장 상징적인 대회로 꼽힙니다. 모나코 그랑프리는 1950년부터 시작돼 지금까지 이어지고 있고, 대회 기간 동안 전체 관광 수입의 약 30%를 벌어들일 만큼 경제적 효과도 큽니다. F1 역시 모나코를 특별하게 생각합니다. 상징성과 흥행력이 높기 때문에, 때로는 개최권료를 거의 받지 않거나 276억 원 수준의 상대적으로 낮은 비용만 받고 대회를 개최하기도 하죠.\n싱가포르 역시 F1 하면 빼놓을 수 없는 도시입니다. 2008년부터 시작된 싱가포르 그랑프리는 도심 스트리트 서킷에서 야간에 펼쳐지는 ‘나이트 레이스’로 유명합니다. 루프탑 바나 고층 빌딩에서도 경기를 관람할 수 있어 도시 전체가 축제 분위기로 바뀌죠. 지난 10년간 이 대회를 보기 위해 싱가포르를 찾은 관광객은 약 45만 명, 이들이 쓴 돈은 약 2조 원에 달합니다. 싱가포르 정부가 매년 487억 원의 개최권료를 기꺼이 지불하는 이유가 여기에 있습니다.\n한 번 실패했던 한국,\n다시 F1에 도전할 수 있을까\n한국도 한때 F1 대회를 개최한 적이 있습니다. 2010년부터 2013년까지 전남 영암에서 열렸지만, F1에 대한 낮은 인지도, 접근성 부족, 열악한 인프라 탓에 흥행에 실패했고, 높은 개최권 비용(약 480억 원)과 수익성 악화로 2014년부터 대회 개최를 포기했습니다. 영암 F1 대회조직위원회의 발표에 따르면 2010년에는 700억 원, 2011년에는 600억 원의 적자를 기록했습니다.\n\n2012년 영암에서 펼쳐진 코리아 그랑프리에 참가한 레드불 팀 / 사진: 로이터\n그런데 최근 인천시가 다시 F1 대회 유치에 나섰습니다. 싱가포르처럼 도심 스트리트 서킷을 고려하고 있고, 이를 위해 인천시는 전체 사업비의 30%를 국비로 지원받기 위해 노력 중입니다. 인천은 국제공항과 수도권 접근성이라는 이점을 갖췄고, 무엇보다 지금은 한국에서도 F1 콘텐츠의 팬층이 꽤 형성됐다는 점에서 성공 가능성이 있어 보입니다.\nF1 대회는 지구상에서 가장 빠른 스포츠 대회입니다. 하지만 F1 대회 개최 여부에 대한 논의는 다양한 문제를 검토해야 하기 때문에 빠르게 하면 안 됩니다. 인천의 F1 대회가 싱가포르 대회와 같은 성공을 거두려면 더더욱 그렇죠. 싱가포르도 F1 대회 유치를 결정하기까지 5~6년 동안 면밀한 검토를 했습니다.\n과연 한 차례 실패를 경험했던 한국에서 F1 대회는 성공할 수 있을까요?\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",
