        "content:encodedSnippet": "vcpkg, an open-source C/C++ package manager maintained by Microsoft, is increasingly recognized as a leading dependency management solution. As an enterprise-grade tool, it enables organizations to streamline library imports, reduce duplication, and support flexible, reproducible builds across a wide array of environments.\nThis need for streamlined dependency management is especially relevant in the build system for the Visual Studio repository. This system not only supports the development of Visual Studio itself but also integrates decades of legacy infrastructure, specialized tools, and complex architecture. The primary goal of integrating vcpkg is to simplify the acquisition and management of open-source native libraries by providing a unified solution that not only replaces manual compilation and custom integration for each project but also ensures security compliance throughout the process.\nTo achieve our objectives, we divided the execution into two distinct phases: an initial phase focused on prototyping and experimentation, followed by a second phase dedicated to productization and integration into the build process.\nPrototype\nThis investigation started by adopting vcpkg from scratch, aiming to make it easier to use existing package libraries in the build environment. We started with a practical experiment: integrating vcpkg into our environment with the SQLite library.\nWe chose SQLite because it’s widely used and handled differently across various build components, making it an excellent test case for streamlining and standardizing library management. This investigation also demonstrates that we can adapt the cereal and libuv libraries for local vcpkg use.\nWhy vcpkg?\nSupports secure, reproducible builds in isolated environments.\nPrivate registry: lets our organization keep an internal catalog of approved libraries and library versions, simplifying compliance, standardization and security screening.\nAsset caching: allows build machines to get source files and tools from internal servers, without the need for public internet access.\nAs part of our previous workflow, our build environment used MSBuild and relied on NuGet packages to manage tools and libraries. Each build component compiles libraries such as SQLite and applies its own preprocessor flags and build logic for integration. As a result, separate projects repeatedly build the same library sources instead of compiling them once and reusing them as a static library across the solution.\nThis approach presents several challenges: there is no unified solution for dependency management, each build configuration requires manual upkeep, and library usage is inconsistent across components.\nMicrosoft’s sandboxed build environment automates software compilation, packaging, and deployment in local and cloud environments. Projects build independently on isolated cloud machines, supporting continuous integration workflows and simplifying build tracking, diagnostics, and artifact distribution. The lack of internet access and Visual Studio in this sandboxed build environment presents additional challenges for acquiring and maintaining open-source native libraries.\nBuild Integration\nAfter the prototype is successfully completed, the project was scaled up across the entire build environment.\nTo avoid high maintenance costs, the team generates custom vcpkg triplets during the build process. Custom triplets allow developers to define specific build configurations (e.g., platform, architecture, compiler settings) tailored to the project. This flexibility is essential for our heterogeneous build environments and helps ensure compatibility across legacy and modern components.\n\nTriplet Generator Projects:\nDynamically create custom vcpkg triplets during the build process.\nEliminate the need for checked-in triplets, reducing maintenance overhead.\nAutomatically configure toolset paths and compiler settings (PATH, INCLUDE, LIB).\nEnsure consistent library configurations and IntelliSense support across all projects.\nInternal Asset Caching Tool:\nSecurely retrieves Open-Source Software (OSS) dependencies from internal registries.\nResolves challenges related to restricted or offline build environments.\nEnsures compliance and traceability for third-party libraries.\nLibrary Integration:\nLibraries such as SQLite, libuv, and cereal are built in a consistent and reproducible way.\nProvides seamless integration with MSBuild.\nMinimizes manual configuration and improves build reliability.\nSandboxed Build Environment Integration\n\nChallenges Addressed:\nIntroduced dedicated build nodes to handle vcpkg installation tasks efficiently.\nLeveraged triplet generator projects to override and improve CloudBuild’s native vcpkg integration.\nEnsured libraries are built once and reliably reused across dependent projects, reducing redundant builds and improving consistency.\nConclusion\nvcpkg has emerged as Microsoft’s preferred solution for C++ dependency management, with many teams using it to address their needs. By adopting vcpkg, we were able to drive increased productivity, security compliance and consistency across our engineering processes.\nInterested in learning more?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details about Meta’s Generative Ads Recommendation Model (GEM), a new foundation model that delivers increased ad performance and advertiser ROI by enhancing other ads recommendation models’ ability to serve relevant ads.\nGEM’s novel architecture allows it to scale with an increasing number of parameters while consistently generating more precise predictions efficiently.\nGEM propagates its learnings, leveraging a suite of post-training techniques across the entire ads model fleet, enabling a paradigm shift in Meta’s Ads Recommendation system.\nGEM leverages enhanced training scalability that efficiently utilizes thousands of GPUs for building and iterating an LLM-scale ads foundation model.\nGEM is already driving significant increases in ad conversions across Instagram and Facebook.\nMeta has been at the forefront of harnessing AI across our products and services to drive business value for advertisers. Leveraging advanced techniques to personalize ads for people and maximize the performance of each ad impression is an integral part of how we develop our Ads Recommendation system. \nThe Generative Ads Recommendation Model (GEM) is Meta’s most advanced ads foundation model, built on an LLM-inspired paradigm and trained across thousands of GPUs.  It is the largest foundation model for recommendation systems (RecSys) in the industry, trained at the scale of large language models. GEM introduces architectural innovations that unlock efficient scaling laws, delivering performance gains that scale cost-effectively with data and compute. Training breakthroughs such as multi-dimensional parallelism, custom GPU kernels, and memory optimizations make it feasible to train GEM at its scale. Post-training, GEM applies advanced knowledge transfer techniques to amplify the performance of downstream models across the entire ads stack, delivering more relevant and personalized ad experiences aligned with people’s preferences. Since launching GEM earlier this year, GEM’s launch across Facebook and Instagram has delivered a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram and a 3% increase in ad conversions on Facebook Feed in Q2. \nIn Q3, we made improvements to GEM’s model architecture that doubled the performance benefit we get from adding a given amount of data and compute. This will enable us to continue scaling up the amount of training capacity we use on GEM at an attractive ROI.\nIntroducing GEM\nGEM represents a significant advancement in RecSys through three key innovations: model scaling with advanced architecture, post-training techniques for knowledge transfer, and enhanced training infrastructure to support scalability. These innovations efficiently boost ad performance, enable effective knowledge sharing across the ad model fleet, and optimize the use of thousands of GPUs for training. GEM has driven a paradigm shift in ads RecSys, transforming ad performance across the funnel — awareness, engagement, and conversion — through joint optimization of both user and advertiser objectives.\nBuilding a large foundation model for Meta’s ads RecSys requires addressing several key challenges:\nHandling a large, dynamic feature space across all of Meta’s apps: Every day, billions of user-ad interactions occur across our platforms, but meaningful signals — such as clicks and conversions — are very sparse. GEM must learn from this vast but imbalanced data, recognizing meaningful patterns and generalizing across diverse users and behaviors.\nProcessing a diverse array of data: GEM must learn from a diverse array of ads data — including advertiser goals, creative formats, measurement signals, and user behaviors across multiple delivery channels. This heterogeneity adds significant modeling complexity, requiring GEM to unify multimodal, multi-source inputs and capture nuanced interactions to power other ads recommendation models.\nTraining efficiently: Training and scaling a large foundation model demands thousands of GPUs and leveraging advanced parallelism and system-level optimization to ensure efficient hardware utilization. \nGEM overcomes these challenges through:\n A scalable model architecture that is now 4x more efficient at driving ad performance gains for a given amount of data and compute than our original ads recommendation ranking models. \nA new framework that improves knowledge transfer effectiveness, achieving 2x the effectiveness of standard knowledge distillation.\nA new training stack that delivers a 23x increase in effective training FLOPS with a 1.43x increase in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) using 16x more GPUs. \nBuilding and Scaling GEM’s Architecture\nGEM is trained on ad content and user engagement data from both ads and organic interactions. From this data, we derive features that we categorize into two groups: sequence features (such as activity history) and non-sequence features (such as user and ad attributes — e.g., age, location, ad format, and creative representation). Customized attention mechanisms are applied to each group independently, while also enabling cross-feature learning. This design improves accuracy and scales both the depth and breadth of each attention block, delivering 4× the efficiency of our previous generation of models.\n\nNon-Sequence Feature Interaction Modeling\nUnderstanding how user attributes interact with ad characteristics is crucial for accurate recommendations. GEM enhances the Wukong architecture to use stackable factorization machines with cross-layer attention connections, allowing the model to learn which feature combinations matter most. Each Wukong block can scale vertically (for deeper interactions) and horizontally (for broader feature coverage), enabling the discovery of increasingly complex user-ad patterns.\nOffline Sequence Feature Modeling\nUser behavior sequences — spanning long sequences of ad / content clicks, views, and interactions — contain rich signals about preferences and intent, yet traditional architectures struggle to process such long sequences efficiently. GEM overcomes this challenge with a pyramid-parallel structure, stacking multiple parallel interaction modules in a pyramid formation to capture complex user-ad relationships at scale. The new scalable offline feature infrastructure processes sequences of up to thousands of events with minimal storage cost, so GEM can learn from a much longer history of user organic and ad interactions. By modeling these extended user behavior sequences, GEM can more effectively uncover patterns and relationships, resulting in a deeper and more accurate understanding of the user’s purchase journey.\nCross-Feature Learning\nExisting approaches compress user behavior sequences into compact vectors for downstream tasks, which risks losing critical engagement signals. GEM takes a different approach that preserves full sequence information while enabling efficient cross-feature learning. Our design, InterFormer, employs parallel summarization with an interleaving structure that alternates between sequence learning (e.g., custom transformer architecture) and cross-feature interaction layers. This allows progressively refining its sequence understanding while maintaining access to the complete user journey. This design facilitates efficient interaction learning while preserving the structural integrity of user sequence data — enabling GEM to scale to higher layer counts without losing critical behavioral signals.\nMulti-Domain Learning With Domain-Specific Optimization\nTraditional ad recommendation systems struggle to balance learning across a broad product ecosystem — treating surfaces either in isolation (thus missing valuable cross-platform insights) or identically (ignoring platform-specific behaviors). Different Meta surfaces like Facebook, Instagram, and Business Messaging each have unique user behaviors and interaction patterns. GEM solves this through learning from cross-surface user interactions while ensuring predictions remain tailored to each surface’s unique characteristics. For example, this enables GEM to use insights from Instagram video ad engagement to improve Facebook Feed ad predictions, while also optimizing each domain’s predictions for its specific objective (such as clicks or conversions).\nMaximizing Transfer Efficiency With Post Training Techniques\nGEM only delivers impact if its knowledge can be efficiently transferred to hundreds of user-facing vertical models (VMs). To translate the performance of the GEM foundation model (FM) into measurable gains for user-facing VMs, we employ both direct and hierarchical knowledge transfer strategies. \nDirect transfer enables GEM to transfer knowledge to major VMs within the same data spaces where GEM was trained. Hierarchical transfer distills knowledge from GEM into domain-specific FMs, which then teach VMs, driving broad improvements across ad models. Together, these approaches use a suite of techniques, including knowledge distillation, representation learning, and parameter sharing to maximize transfer efficiency across the entire ad model space, achieving 2x the effectiveness of standard knowledge distillation.\n\nKnowledge Distillation\nIn Meta’s ads system, VMs often suffer from stale supervision caused by delays in FM training and evaluation as well as domain mismatches between GEM or FM predictions and the VMs’ surface-specific objectives. These outdated or misaligned signals between the VMs (students) and GEM (the teacher) can degrade the accuracy and adaptability of student models over time.\nTo address this, we use a Student Adapter during training, a lightweight component that refines the teacher’s outputs using the most recent ground-truth data. It learns a transformation that better aligns teacher predictions with observed outcomes, ensuring that student models receive more up-to-date and domain-relevant supervision throughout training.\nRepresentation Learning\nRepresentation learning is the process by which models automatically drive meaningful and compact features from raw data, enabling more effective downstream tasks like ad click prediction. Representation learning complements knowledge distillation by generating semantically aligned features that support efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to student models. With this approach GEM can effectively improve FM-to-VM transfer efficiency without adding inference overhead.\nParameter Sharing\nParameter sharing is a technique in which multiple models or components reuse the same set of parameters to reduce redundancy, improve efficiency, and facilitate knowledge transfer.\nIn our context, parameter sharing enables efficient knowledge reuse by allowing VMs to selectively incorporate components from FMs. This lets smaller, latency-sensitive VMs leverage the rich representations and pre-learned patterns of FMs without incurring their full computational cost.\nHow GEM Was Trained\nGEM operates at a scale typically only seen by modern LLMs. Training GEM required a complete overhaul of our training recipes. The re-engineered training stack delivers a 23x increase in effective training FLOPs using 16x more GPUs while also improving efficiency. MFU, a key measure of hardware efficiency, increased by 1.43x, reflecting better use of GPU resources. This ability to increase both throughput and efficiency is important to training foundation models of this scale.\nTo support massive model sizes and multimodal workloads, we employ strategies such as multi-dimensional parallelism, custom GPU kernels, and model-system co-design. These techniques enable near-linear scaling, applied to thousands of GPUs, improving compute throughput, memory usage, and overall hardware efficiency. \nDistributed Training\nTraining large models, like GEM, requires carefully orchestrated parallelism strategies across both dense and sparse components. For the dense parts of the model, techniques like Hybrid Sharded Distributed Parallel (HSDP) optimize memory usage and reduce communication costs, enabling efficient distribution of dense parameters across thousands of GPUs. In contrast, the sparse components — primarily large embedding tables used for user and item features — employ a two-dimensional approach using data parallelism and model parallelism, optimized for synchronization efficiency and memory locality.\nSystem-Level Optimizations for GPU Throughput\nBeyond parallelism, we implemented a suite of techniques to saturate GPU compute throughput and reduce training bottlenecks:\nA custom in-house GPU kernel designed for variable-length (jagged) user sequences and computation fusion, leveraging the latest GPU hardware features and optimization techniques.\nGraph-level compilation in PyTorch 2.0 that automates key optimizations, including activation checkpointing for memory savings and operator fusion for improved execution efficiency.\nMemory compression techniques such as FP8 quantization for activations and unified embedding formats to reduce memory footprint.\nAdditionally, we developed GPU communication collectives that operate without utilizing Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) resources via NCCLX (Meta’s fork of NVIDIA’s NCCL) to eliminate contention between communication and compute workloads, improving overlap and GPU utilization.\nReducing Training Overhead and Job Startup Time\nTo improve training agility and minimize GPU idleness, we optimized effective training time (ETT) — the proportion of training time spent processing new data. We reduced job startup time by 5x through optimizing trainer init, data reader setup, checkpointing, and PyTorch 2.0 compilation time, etc. Notably we reduced PyTorch 2.0 compilation time by 7x via caching strategies. \nMaximizing GPU Efficiency Across the Development Lifecycle \nGPU efficiency is optimized across all stages of the model lifecycle — from early experimentation to large-scale training and post-training. In the exploration phase, we accelerate iteration using lightweight model variants at a much lower cost compared to full-sized models. These variants support over half of all experiments, enabling faster idea validation with minimal resource overhead. During the post-training stage, the model runs forward passes to generate knowledge, including labels and embeddings, for downstream models. Unlike in large language models, we also perform continuous online training to refresh the FMs. We enhance traffic sharing between training and post-training knowledge generation, as well as between the foundation model and downstream models, to reduce computational demand. Additionally, GPU efficiency optimization has been applied across all stages to improve end-to-end system throughput. \nThe Future of Foundation Models for Ads Recommendations\nThe future of ads recommendation systems will be defined by a deeper understanding of people’s preferences and intent, making every interaction feel personal. For advertisers, this translates into one-to-one connections at scale, driving stronger engagement and outcomes.\nLooking ahead, GEM will learn from Meta’s entire ecosystem including user interactions on organic and ads content across modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. These learnings from GEM will be extended to cover all major surfaces across Facebook and Instagram. This stronger multimodal foundation helps GEM capture nuances behind clicks, conversions, and long-term value, paving the way for a unified engagement model that can intelligently rank both organic content and ads, delivering maximum value for people and advertisers.\nWe will continue to scale GEM and train on even larger clusters by advancing its architecture and advancing training recipes on the latest AI hardware, enabling it to learn efficiently from more data with diverse modalities to deliver precise predictions. We will also evolve GEM to reason with inference-time scaling to optimize compute allocation, power intent-centric user journeys, and enable agentic, insight-driven advertiser automation that drive higher ROAS.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Yasmine Badr, John Bocharov, Shuo Chang, Laming Chen, Wenlin Chen, Wentao Duan, Xiaorui Gan, Shuo Gu, Mengyue Hang, Yuxi Hu, Yuzhen Huang, Shali Jiang, Santanu Kolay, Zhijing Li, Boyang Liu, Rocky Liu, Xi Liu, Liang Luo, GP Musumeci, Sandeep Pandey, Richard Qiu, Jason Rudy, Vibha Sinha, Matt Steiner, Musharaf Sultan, Chonglin Sun, Viral Vimawala, Ernest Wang, Xiaozhen Xia, Jackie (Jiaqi) Xu, Fan Yang, Xin Zhang, Buyun Zhang, Zhengyu Zhang, Qinghai Zhou, Song Zhou, Zhehui Zhou, Rich Zhu and the entire team behind the development and productionization of the largest foundation model in Meta’s ads recommendation system.\nThe post Meta’s Generative Ads Model (GEM): The Central Brain Accelerating Ads Recommendation AI Innovation appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

This technology offers a robust solution for content provenance tagging (an indication of where the content came from), enabling the identification and tracking of content to support various use cases. At its core, invisible watermarking works by subtly modifying pixel values in images, waveforms in audio, or text tokens generated by large language models (LLMs) to embed a small amount of data. The design of watermarking systems adds necessary redundancy; this ensures the embedded identification remains persistent through transcodes and editing, unlike metadata tags that can be lost.\nBringing an invisible watermarking solution to production at scale presents many challenges. In this blog post, we’ll discuss how we overcame challenges with deployment environments, bitrate increases, and visual quality regressions to adapt to real-world use cases.\n\nSome Helpful Definitions\nDigital watermarking, steganography, and invisible watermarking are related concepts, but it’s important to understand their differences:\nFeature\nDigital Watermarking\nSteganography\nInvisible Watermarking\n\n\nPurpose\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\nSecret communication\nContent attribution, protection, provenance\n\n\nVisibility\nVisible or invisible\nInvisible\nInvisible\n\n\nRobustness\nagainst content modifications\nMedium to high\nUsually low\nHigh (survives edits)\n\n\nPayload / Message  Capacity\nMedium (varies)\nVaries\nMedium (e.g., >64 bits)\n\n\nComputational Cost\nLow (visible) to high (invisible)\nVaries\nHigh (advanced ML models)\n\n\n\n\nThe Need for Robust Content Tagging\nIn today’s digital landscape, where content is constantly shared, remixed, and even AI-generated, important questions arise:\nWho Published the Video First?\nIn the photos in Figure 1, you can see two different user names, but there’s no visual indicator of who uploaded this image first. Invisible watermarking can help identify the first time a video was uploaded.\nFigure 1: Screenshots of what appear to be the same video uploaded by two users on Instagram Reels.\nIs It Even a Real Image?\nWith increasingly realistic generative AI (GenAI) videos, distinguishing between real and AI-generated content is increasingly challenging. Invisible watermarking can be used to infer if content such as in Figure 2 is AI-generated.\nFigure 2: An AI-generated image.\nWhat Camera Was Used? \nWhen encountering a compelling image or video like the one in Figure 3, people often wonder about the source and tools used for creation. Invisible watermarking can infer this information directly.\nFigure 3: A screenshot from a video captured with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.\nTraditional methods such as visual watermarks (which can be distracting) or metadata tags (which can be lost if a video is edited or re-encoded) do not address these challenges adequately and robustly. Due to its persistence and imperceptibility, invisible watermarking presents a superior alternative.\nThe Scaling Journey: From GPUs to CPUs\nEarlier digital watermarking research (starting in the 1990s) employed digital signal-processing techniques (such as DCT and DWT) to modify an image’s spectral properties to hide imperceptible information. Although these methods proved highly effective for static images and were considered a “solved problem,” they are not adequately robust against the various types of geometric transformations and filtering we see in social media and other real-world applications. \nToday’s state-of-the-art solutions (such as VideoSeal) use machine-learning (ML) techniques providing significantly improved robustness against the type of edits seen in social media. However, the application of solutions to the video problem domain (i.e., frame-by-frame watermarking) may be prohibitively computationally expensive without the necessary inference optimizations. \nGPUs may seem an obvious solution for deploying ML-based video watermarking solutions. However, most types of GPU hardware are specialized for the training and inference of large-scale models (such as LLMs and diffusion models). They have partial or no support for video transcoding (compression and decompression). Enabling invisible watermarking for videos has therefore posed unique challenges for our existing video-processing software (FFmpeg) and hardware stack (GPUs without video-transcoding capabilities or other custom accelerators for video processing without efficient ML-model inference capabilities). \nGPU Optimization Attempts and the Shift to CPUs\nOur embedding architecture uses FFmpeg with a custom filter to compute and apply invisible watermark masks to the videos. The filter acts as a reusable block that can be added easily to existing video processing pipelines. Migrating to a more optimal inference service for warmed-up models would mean sacrificing the flexibility of our FFmpeg filter, so for our application that was not an option.\nProfiling our invisible watermarking filter revealed low GPU utilization. We implemented frame batching and threading in the filter, but these efforts yielded no significant improvements to latency or utilization. GPUs with hardware video encoders and decoders can more easily reach high throughput, but the GPUs available for our service lack video encoders, requiring frames to be sent back to the CPU for encoding. Here a software video encoder can end up being a major bottleneck for pipelines using low-complexity ML models on a GPU.\nSpecifically, we encountered three primary bottlenecks:\nData transfer overhead: Transferring high-resolution input video frames back and forth between CPUs and multiple GPUs posed challenges to thread and memory optimizations, yielding suboptimal GPU utilization. \nInference latency: Processing multiple invisible watermarking requests across multiple GPUs in parallel on the same host led to a dramatic increase in inference latency.\nModel loading time: Despite the model’s small size, loading the model consumed a significant portion of the total processing time. Relying on FFmpeg prevented us from using warmed-up, pre-loaded models on the GPUs.\nRecognizing these limitations, we began investigating CPU-only inference. The embedder’s neural network architecture is more favorable to GPUs, and initial benchmarks showed that end-to-end (E2E) performance was more than two times slower on CPUs. By adjusting threading parameters for the encoder, decoder, and PyTorch, and optimizing sampling parameters used by the invisible watermarking filter, we saw significant improvements. \nUltimately, with properly tuned threading and embedding parameters, the E2E latency for running invisible watermarking on a CPU in a single process was within 5% of GPU performance. Crucially, we could run multiple FFmpeg processes in parallel on CPUs without increased latency. This breakthrough allowed us to calculate the capacity needed and achieve a more operationally efficient solution compared to a GPU-based solution.\nTo validate our CPU solution’s scalability in a distributed system, we conducted comprehensive load tests. Given a pool of CPU workers, we generated test traffic at increasing request rates to identify the peak performance point before per-request latency began to rise. For comparison, we used the same parameters with GPU inference on a pool of GPU workers with similar capabilities. The results confirmed that our CPU solution could perform at scale, comparable to our local test findings. This achievement allowed us to provision the required capacity with greater operational efficiency compared to a GPU-based approach.\nOptimization Considerations and Trade-offs\nDeploying invisible watermarking at scale presented several optimization challenges, primarily involving trade-offs between four metrics:\nLatency: The speed at which the watermarking process occurs\nWatermark detection bit-accuracy: The accuracy of detecting embedded watermarks\nVisual quality: Ensuring the embedded watermark is imperceptible to the human eye\nCompression efficiency (measured by BD-Rate): Ensuring the embedded watermark does not significantly increase bitrate\nOptimizing for one metric may negatively impact others. For example, a stronger watermark for higher bit accuracy might lead to visible artifacts and increased bitrate. We can’t create a perfectly optimal solution for all four metrics si\nManaging BD-Rate Impact\nInvisible watermarking, while imperceptible, introduces increased entropy, which can lead to a higher bitrate for video encoders. Our initial implementation showed a BD-Rate regression of around 20%, meaning users would need more bandwidth to watch a watermarked video. To mitigate this, we devised a novel frame-selection method for watermarking so that the BD-Rate impact is largely reduced while increasing visual quality and minimally impacting watermark bit detection accuracy.\nAddressing Regressions in Visual Quality \nWe need to ensure the “invisible” watermark remains truly invisible. We initially observed noticeable visual artifacts despite high-quality metric scores (VMAF and SSIM).\nWe addressed the visual-quality evaluations by implementing a custom post-processing technique and iterating through different embedding settings through crowdsourced manual inspections. This subjective evaluation was crucial for unblocking us, as traditional visual quality metrics proved insufficient for detecting the type of artifact an invisible watermark can at times introduce. As we tuned the algorithm for human invisibility, we closely monitored the bit accuracy impact to achieve an optimal balance between visual quality and detection accuracy.\nLearnings and the Road Ahead\nOur journey to deploy a scalable, invisible watermarking solution provided valuable insights:\nWith proper optimizations, CPU-only pipelines can reach performances comparable to GPU pipelines for specific use cases at much lower cost. Contrary to our initial assumptions, with the right optimizations CPUs offered us a more operationally efficient and scalable solution for our invisible-watermarking system. While GPUs are still faster for the invisible watermark model inference, we were able to use optimizations to bring down the overall compute and latency with the CPU fleet.\nTraditional video quality scores are insufficient for invisible watermarking: We learned that metrics like VMAF and SSIM do not fully capture the perceptual quality issues introduced by invisible watermarking, necessitating manual inspection. More research is needed to develop a metric to programmatically detect the visual-quality loss incurred by invisible watermarking.\nThe quality bar for production use is high: Watermarking techniques may not directly apply to real-world use cases due to the impact on BD-Rate and downstream video compression. We needed to expand upon the literature to keep BD-Rate impacts low while maintaining excellent bit accuracy for detection.\nWe successfully shipped a scalable watermarking solution with excellent latency, visual quality, detection bit accuracy, and a minimal BD-Rate impact.\nAs our North Star goal, we aim to continue to improve the precision and copy-detection recall with invisible watermark detection. This will involve further tuning of model parameters, pre- and post-processing steps, and video encoder settings. Ultimately, we envision invisible watermarking as a lightweight “filter block” that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of video use cases without product-specific tweaks, providing minimal impact on the user experience while offering robust content provenance.\nThe post Video Invisible Watermarking at Scale appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post was brought to you by Damaso Sanoja, draft.dev. \nDeciding whether to use Python or Rust isn’t just a syntax choice; it’s a career bet. According to the StackOverflow Developer Survey, Python dominates in accessibility, with 66.4% of people learning to code choosing it as their entry point. Python usage skyrocketed from 32% in 2017 to 57% in 2024, making it the tool of choice for “more than half of the world’s programmers.” GitHub has also reported that Python overtook JavaScript as their most-used language for the first time in over a decade.\nBut Rust’s trajectory tells a different story. Despite its complexity, its usage has grown from 7% to 11% since 2020. It’s also been the “Most Admired programming language” for nine straight years, with over 80% of developers wanting to continue using it.\nThe real question isn’t which language will “win” – it’s which one positions you for the problems you want to solve. This article explores their syntax, performance, learning curves, type systems, memory management, concurrency, ecosystems, and tooling to help you make a decision that aligns with both market realities and your career goals.\nTL;DR:\nPython and Rust serve different goals. Python wins on accessibility, flexibility, and a vast ecosystem. Ideal for rapid development, data science, and automation. Rust shines in performance, safety, and concurrency, making it perfect for systems programming and large-scale, reliable software.\nIn short: choose Python to build fast, iterate faster, and reach users quickly; choose Rust to build software that runs fast, scales safely, and lasts. Many developers now combine both; using Rust for performance-critical parts inside Python apps.\n\n\n\n\nSyntax and Readability\nPython’s syntax is praised for its clean, English-like structure that closely resembles written algorithms or planning notes. It prioritizes developer approachability and rapid prototyping through dynamic typing, which means you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly. This allows for very concise code. Python’s PEP 8 style guide establishes consistent formatting conventions that make Python code predictable and easy to scan.\nFor example, you can define a simple add function, assign a string to a variable, and create a formatted message with just a few lines of code:\n# Python: Flexible and concise\n\ndef add(a, b):\n\n  return a + b\n\nname = \"World\"\n\nmessage = f\"Hello, {name}!\"\nRust uses C-style syntax that requires you to specify types (fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32) and declare when variables can change (let mut message = String::new();). This looks more verbose and adds learning challenges like ownership (like &str for borrowed string slices), but it’s intentional. Rust’s explicit approach catches more errors at compile time and makes program structure clearer, even though you might write more code. Tools like rustfmt handle code formatting automatically.\nHere’s how the same functionality looks in Rust, with explicit type declarations and mutability:\n// Rust: Explicit types, mutability, and function signature\n\n// Function definition\n\nfn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {\n\n    a + b\n\n}\n\nfn main() {\n\n    let name: &str = \"World\";\n\n    let message: String = format!(\"Hello, {}!\", name);\n\n    println!(\"{}\", message);\n\n    let mut count: i32 = 0;\n\n    count += 1;\n\n    println!(\"Count: {}\", count);\n\n    // Using the add function\n\n    let sum = add(5, 10);\n\n    println!(\"Sum: {}\", sum);\n\n}\nThis core difference – Python’s easy flow versus Rust’s strict structure – is often what developers first notice when choosing between them, and it affects both how you write code and how fast it runs.\nPerformance and Speed\nThe differences between Rust and Python become even more apparent when looking at their raw performance.\nRust compiles directly to machine code before you run it, so it’s fast and efficient. Python reads and translates your code line by line as it runs, which is more flexible but slower. Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and lack of a garbage collector also contribute to its speed advantage, especially for CPU-heavy tasks.\nYou can see the difference in real-world benchmarks where Rust consistently runs faster and uses less memory. However, it’s worth noting that benchmark results are frequently updated and can vary based on the specific tests and implementations used.\nThese are some commonly observed performance patterns:\nExecution speed: Rust frequently outperforms Python by substantial margins in CPU-intensive tasks, with advantages ranging from modest improvements to dramatic speed-ups depending on the specific computational workload.\nMemory efficiency: Rust’s zero-cost abstractions and lack of garbage collection typically result in significantly lower memory usage compared to Python’s runtime overhead.\nConsistency: These performance characteristics remain relatively stable across different types of computational tasks, from mathematical simulations to algorithmic challenges.\nPerformance differences will depend on your specific setup and code, but Rust consistently wins for heavy computational work.\nThe speed gap means Rust works better for large, time-critical systems, while Python’s speed is often good enough when you want to build and test ideas quickly rather than squeeze out maximum performance.\nEase of Use and Learning Curve\nPython is famous for its gentle learning curve; its simple syntax and flexibility make it great for beginners who want to build things quickly. For example, reading user input and displaying a personalized greeting takes just a few straightforward lines:\n# Python: Reading and printing a name\n\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\n\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\nRust’s strict compiler and ownership system require much more upfront learning. The same greeting task in Rust immediately throws several complex concepts at you. This code shows how you need explicit imports for basic input/output, function signatures that handle errors (io::Result<()>), mutable string creation (String::new()), explicit error checking (the ? operator), and details like flushing output and trimming input:\n// Rust: Reading and printing a name with error handling\n\nuse std::io::{self, Write}; // Import necessary modules\n\nfn main() -> io::Result<()> { // main function returns a Result for I/O errors\n\n    print!(\"Enter your name: \");\n\n    io::stdout().flush()?; // Ensure the prompt is displayed before input\n\n    let mut name = String::new(); // Declare a mutable string to store input\n\n    io::stdin().read_line(&mut name)?; // Read line, handle potential error\n\n    println!(\"Hello, {}!\", name.trim()); // Trim whitespace (like newline) and print\n\n    Ok(()) // Indicate success\n\n}\nThis heavy upfront learning makes Rust harder to start with, but it’s part of Rust’s design. The language acts like a strict teacher, forcing you to write safe, efficient code from the beginning. You get more control and fewer runtime crashes in exchange for the initial difficulty.\nPython gets you started immediately, while Rust makes you work harder upfront for more reliable code.\nTyping System (Static vs. Dynamic)\nPython uses dynamic typing, where types are checked at runtime, providing great flexibility and accelerating initial development as you rarely need explicit type declarations. This freedom, however, means type-related errors (like TypeError) may only surface during execution, which is a potential risk in larger systems. To address this, Python developers often use tools like mypy, a static type checker that analyzes code before runtime to catch type-related errors early and improve code safety in larger projects.\nRust uses static typing, which means it checks all your types before your code even runs. While this demands more upfront effort to satisfy the compiler’s rigor, it’s a powerful early warning system and significantly reduces type-related runtime errors and improves code maintainability. Rust’s type system includes enums like Option<T> and Result<T, E> to handle the absence of values and recoverable errors explicitly. You need to weigh Python’s development speed against Rust’s early error detection and type safety checks that happen before the program runs.\nMemory Management\nPython uses automatic garbage collection with reference counting and a cycle detector to clean up memory automatically. This frees you from the burden of memory management, which simplifies coding. But it can cause unpredictable pauses and performance overhead, which can be a problem for time-critical applications like financial trading systems or robotics, where consistent timing is crucial.\nRust takes a completely different approach with its ownership system, which handles memory management while your code compiles. Through ownership rules, borrowing (utilizing & for immutable and &mut for mutable references), and lifetimes, Rust prevents common memory errors like null pointer dereferences, dangling pointers, and use-after-free errors in safe code – all without a runtime garbage collector. While unsafe blocks allow you to bypass these protections when needed, most Rust code benefits from these safety guarantees. This results in highly predictable performance and fine-grained control. However, mastering the borrow checker and its concepts can be challenging if you’re used to garbage-collected languages.\nThe choice here is stark: Python offers easy memory management, while Rust demands more work upfront for memory safety and performance.\nConcurrency and Parallelism\nThe threading module in Python’s common CPython implementation allows you to easily create threads:\n# Python: Basic thread creation\n\nimport threading\n\ndef python_task():\n\n    print(\"Hello from a Python thread!\")\n\n# To run it:\n\n# thread = threading.Thread(target=python_task)\n\n# thread.start()\n\n# thread.join()\nHowever, Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously for CPU-bound tasks, which limits true parallelism on multicore processors. This means that even on a system with multiple CPU cores, only one Python thread can actually execute at any given time – threads must take turns rather than running simultaneously on different cores. This makes Python’s threading module most effective for I/O-bound operations, where threads can release the GIL while waiting for external operations.\nFor efficient single-threaded concurrency in I/O tasks, Python offers asyncio. For true CPU parallelism, you need the multiprocessing module, which creates separate processes to bypass the GIL but uses more memory and requires complex communication between processes. While experimental efforts like PEP 703 aim to make the GIL optional, Python’s concurrency requires navigating these trade-offs.\nRust is known for its fearless concurrency, thanks to its ownership and type systems that prevent data races at compile time. Creating a basic thread is straightforward using std::thread:\n// Rust: Basic thread creation\n\nuse std::thread;\n\nfn rust_task() {\n\n    println!(\"Hello from a Rust thread!\");\n\n}\n\n// To run (e.g., in main function):\n\n// let handle = thread::spawn(rust_task);\n\n// handle.join().unwrap();\nCritically, threads like this in Rust can run in true parallel on different CPU cores because Rust does not have a GIL. Compile-time checks involving Send and Sync traits ensure that data shared between threads is handled safely. For more complex scenarios, Rust offers powerful tools like async/await for asynchronous programming and types like Arc and Mutex for safe shared-state concurrency.\nSumming up, Rust excels at building highly concurrent, multithreaded applications that demand maximum hardware efficiency.\nEcosystem and Libraries\nPython has an extensive, mature ecosystem; PyPI (Python Package Index) offers an unparalleled array of libraries for nearly every domain, especially data science (eg NumPy, pandas, and TensorFlow), web development (eg Django, Flask, and FastAPI), and automation, complemented by a batteries-included standard library.\nRust’s ecosystem, managed via the Cargo build tool and package manager sourcing from crates.io, is younger but expanding. It’s particularly good for systems programming, WebAssembly, networking, and command line tools, with libraries engineered for performance and safety. Interestingly, Rust is increasingly used to build high-performance tools for the Python world (eg Polars, Ruff, and uv), showing how the two languages can also work together rather than just compete.\nThe ecosystem choice often depends on project requirements: Python’s mature, extensive libraries make it ideal for rapid development and established domains like data science and web development, while Rust’s performance-focused ecosystem shines when you need maximum efficiency and safety or are building foundational tools that others will depend on.\nIDE and Tooling Support\nPython’s great tooling matches its popularity; it’s been the #2 programming language since early 2020. Comprehensive IDEs like PyCharm and interactive tools like Jupyter Notebooks give you everything you need: debuggers, linters, test runners, and more. All of which makes Python even easier to use.\nTry PyCharm\n                                                    \nRust’s tooling evolution reflects its remarkable developer satisfaction story. How does a systems language achieve 83% developer retention and “Most Admired” status for nine consecutive years? Partly through exceptional tooling that makes complex concepts manageable. Cargo revolutionized build management, rust-analyzer provides precise code intelligence, and Clippy offers intelligent linting. As more companies adopt Rust, IDEs are also becoming more mature, with tools like JetBrains RustRover providing specialized support for Rust’s ownership model.\nColor-coded inlay error descriptions\n\n\n    \nTry RustRover\n                                                    \nIt’s a classic feedback loop: Python’s popularity drives better tooling, which makes Python even more popular. Rust’s exceptional tooling experience explains why developers who try it stick with it. Both languages benefit from this virtuous cycle, serving different developer needs and project requirements.\nComparison Table: Rust vs. Python\nHere’s an overview of the key differences between Rust and Python:\n\nFeatureRustPython\nSyntax & ReadabilityExplicit, C-family syntax; can be verbose but aims for clarity and may offer lower cognitive complexity; rustfmt for style.Minimalist, near-pseudocode style; generally beginner-friendly and concise; PEP 8 for style conventions.\nPerformance & SpeedCompiled to optimized machine code; very high raw performance and no GC pauses; ideal for CPU-bound and time-sensitive systems.Primarily interpreted; slower execution speed for CPU-bound tasks; potential GC pauses; often adequate for I/O-bound tasks and rapid development.\nEase of Use & Learning CurveSteeper learning curve due to its strict compiler, ownership model, and lifetimes; rewards effort with safe and efficient code.Gentle learning curve with simple syntax and dynamic typing; facilitates rapid development and prototyping; very accessible to beginners.\nTyping SystemStatic, strong compile-time type enforcement; significantly reduces runtime type errors and enhances maintainability; expressive type system.Dynamic typing with runtime type checking; offers flexibility and reduces boilerplate, but type errors may surface at runtime; optional static type hints available.\nMemory ManagementCompile-time enforcement via ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes; no garbage collector, leading to predictable performance and control.Automatic garbage collection (primarily reference counting with a cycle detector); simplifies memory management for developers but can introduce overhead and pauses.\nConcurrency & Parallelism“Fearless concurrency” due to compile-time data-race prevention; no GIL, enabling true multicore parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.GIL in CPython limits true CPU-bound parallelism in threads; asyncio is effective for I/O-bound concurrency; multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.\nEcosystem & LibrariesRapidly growing ecosystem via Cargo and crates.io; strong in systems programming, WebAssembly, networking, and CLI tools; performance-focused libraries.Vast, mature ecosystem via PyPI; dominant in data science, machine learning, web development, and automation; extensive “batteries-included” standard library.\nIDE & Tooling SupportSignificantly improved and maturing; strong support from rust-analyzer, Cargo, and Clippy; dedicated IDEs like RustRover by JetBrains enhance productivity.Excellent and mature tooling; widely supported by IDEs like PyCharm and VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks for data science, and a rich collection of linters and debuggers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCareer Insights\nSo, the differences are clear, but how do those differences actually influence which you should use?\nThe career implications of choosing Python versus Rust extend far beyond syntax preferences—they shape your earning potential and job market positioning. Python dominates the hiring landscape with 42% of recruiters actively seeking Python skills, translating into substantial opportunities and a more mature and stable job market. This demand drives competitive compensation, with Python developers earning up to $151,000 annually in the US.\nPython’s career appeal lies in its versatility across high-growth sectors. The language powers data science, machine learning, web backends, enterprise applications, and automation, which are all in high demand.\nRust presents a different but compelling career trajectory. While job openings are fewer, the compensation could be higher: some Rust developers earn up to $198,375 annually. However, Rust’s lower market share also means more volatile job opportunities, with Rust developer wages ranging dramatically from $40.38 to $64.66 per hour and an average of $53 per hour. This wage variation suggests that Rust’s job market is less predictable than Python’s, which enjoys a consistent demand for developers.\nOverall, Rust’s career advantage lies in specialization. 43% of organizations are currently using Rust for non-trivial production use cases like server backends, web3 services, and cloud technologies. These infrastructure roles have the potential to command premium salaries due to their critical nature and the specialized expertise required.\nYour career choice comes down to whether you want Python’s broad job market or Rust’s growing specialization in high-performance, reliable systems.\nHybrid Development Strategies: Rust-Enhanced Python Development\nThe choice between Python and Rust isn’t always black and white. Many developers are going for a third option: use both languages strategically. Keep Python for your main application logic where readability matters, but drop in Rust for the parts that need serious speed.\nThis hybrid approach is gaining real momentum. Major Python tools are being rewritten in Rust with dramatic results. Pydantic-core rewrote its validation logic in Rust and got 17x faster performance. Ruff provides Python linting that’s 10–100x faster than existing tools while installing with a simple pip install ruff.\nThe PyO3 ecosystem makes this integration surprisingly easy. You can write performance-critical functions in Rust and call them directly from Python. Start by prototyping in Python’s friendly syntax, then optimize the slow parts with Rust. Tools like pyo3_bindgen even automatically generate the connections between your Python and Rust code.\nThis co-usage model is appearing in production across major projects, including FastAPI, Jupyter, Pydantic, and Polars, showing its viability at scale. This approach offers immediate performance gains without requiring complete codebase rewrites, making it an attractive middle ground between Python’s accessibility and Rust’s performance characteristics.\nConclusion: Choosing Your Language – Rust and Python\nThis comparison shows that Rust and Python are built for different needs and approaches. Modern software development increasingly reveals that their strengths work together rather than compete.\nPython remains excellent for rapid application development, data analysis, machine learning, and scripting, propelled by its accessible syntax, flexibility, and mature ecosystem. On the other hand, Rust is the best choice for performance-critical applications, systems programming, embedded development, and projects where memory safety and efficient concurrency are essential. \nIf you’re trying to build reliable, high-performance systems with Rust or exploring the language professionally, JetBrains RustRover offers a minimally configured environment with deep language support. With a non-commercial license available for learners and hobbyists, it’s a superb tool to grow with as you delve into Rust.\nCurious about how Rust can benefit from other programming languages?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Go turns 16 this year. To celebrate this milestone, we have taken a closer look at the latest Developer Ecosystem Survey results and examined the evolution of the Go ecosystem over the past five years.\nAccording to JetBrains Data Playground, 2.2 million professional developers use Go as their primary programming language – twice as many as five years ago. If we add pros for whom Go is a secondary language, the number exceeds 5 million.\nGo continues to be a top choice for adoption, as per the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, 11% of all software developers are planning to adopt Go in the next 12 months. Like last year, it is fourth in the JetBrains Language Promise Index, trailing only Typescript, Rust, and Python.\nGo developers usually fall into one of two categories, with some blending both types of roles:\nWeb backend developers who work on web applications involving microservices.\nDevOps or Site Reliability Engineers who manage IT infrastructure platforms (Kubernetes or serverless architectures). They typically work on Kubernetes cluster operators, related Go web microservices and CLI utilities written in Go, Python, or Bash, as well as on infrastructure as code and service support.\nLibraries that shape the Go ecosystem\nStandard library\nGo was designed with a “batteries included” philosophy, and the Go standard library is one of the language’s greatest strengths, usually sufficient for most needs. Developers rely on it because it’s clear, reliable, secure, performant, and simple. In Go culture, “stdlib first” is the default approach; third-party libraries are added mainly for convenience, not out of necessity.\nStill, as Go applications have grown in scope, the ecosystem has evolved, too, with a set of widely used tools emerging that are both reliable and recommended for specific use cases.\nLeading web frameworks and routers\nLet’s examine how the popularity of Go frameworks and Go routers has changed since 2020.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The values total more than 100%, as this was a multiple-selection question.\nThe net/http package, a standard library router, is the most common choice for routing among Go developers. It’s stable and doesn’t rely on any dependencies.\nIn recent years, chi has remained a popular alternative for building Go HTTP services. Usage has grown slightly since 2020, reaching about 12% of developers. chi is an idiomatic, lightweight router that is fully compatible with net/http, well-documented, and actively maintained.\ngorilla/mux, once the most-used and powerful HTTP router, was archived in 2023. Since then, many projects have been migrated to chi or the standard library, especially after Go 1.22 introduced pattern routing in http.ServeMux. By 2025, 17% of Go developers reported using gorilla/mux regularly, down from 36% in 2020. Its share remains notable because of legacy projects, but it is expected to decline further.\nThe most popular Go web frameworks in 2025 are Gin, Echo, and Fiber.\nGin has grown steadily, with nearly half of Go developers (48%) using it in 2025, compared to 41% in 2020. While there’s no single ‘best’ web framework for Go, Gin leads the pack as one of the fastest, most established, and most recommended options.\nFiber, introduced in 2020 with a focus on speed and simplicity, has also gained traction. It’s now used by 11% of Go developers – close to Echo (16%) and ahead of Beego (4%), whose popularity continues to decline.\nTesting frameworks and performance tools\nGo has a strong culture of testing and benchmarking, rooted in its design philosophy that testing should be simple, consistent, and part of everyday development rather than an afterthought. This philosophy is reflected in the language itself: The standard library includes the testing package, which supports unit tests, benchmarks, examples, and fuzzing. Go developers are expected to profile and measure performance using built-in tools like pprof.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The values total more than 100%, as this was a multiple-selection question.\nUsage data confirms the philosophy – the built-in testing package remains the most frequently chosen option for Go developers writing unit tests. Yet for larger or enterprise projects, its capabilities are often insufficient, fueling the growth of frameworks and libraries like testify and gomock since 2020.\nTestify extends the standard testing package, making tests cleaner and more readable. It suits most projects and is currently used by 27% of developers.\ngomock, designed for mocking interfaces and external services, is used by about 21% of Go developers.\nSeveral other Go testing frameworks are less widely used but valuable in specific cases. Ginkgo, often paired with Gomega for expressive matchers, excels in behavior-driven testing. Because they require a heavier setup, these tools are typically chosen for large or complex test suites. Ginkgo’s usage has held steady since 2020 at around 5%.\nGodog is another BDD framework, enabling tests to be written in human-readable Gherkin syntax and linked to Go code. Godog is best suited for aligning developers with QA and product teams around shared understanding, rather than for low-level unit tests. Though not new, Godog has been actively maintained by the Cucumber GitHub organization since 2022 and has grown in adoption, with approximately 4% of Go developers using it in 2025.\nPopular open-source libraries\nHere are the most widely used open-source Go libraries in 2025, grouped by area of application.\nBackend services\nLogging:\n\nlog/slog (structured logging provided by stdlib in Go 1.21 and later) is the natural choice for starting fresh with minimal dependencies.\nlogrus is a structured logging library recommended for projects that must support Go versions earlier than 1.21. Although currently in maintenance mode, it is still stable and widely used.\nzap and, to a lesser extent, zerolog are popular for high-performance logging.\nDatabase:\n\ndatabase/sql (stdlib) provides a generic interface around SQL (or SQL-like) databases.\nsqlx adds quality-of-life enhancements on top of database/sql. It is driver-agnostic and particularly suitable for multiple databases.\npgx is tied to Postgres and often used for first-class PostgreSQL support and performance.\nORM (object-relational mapper) libraries like GORM, ent, and others help map Go structs to database tables, letting you work with the database in a more object-oriented or declarative style. They are recommended for heavy abstraction (migrations, schema modeling, etc.).\nConfiguration:\n\nviper.\ncleanenv.\nValidation:\n\nvalidator.\nCLI applications\ncobra is the most widely used library for building Go CLI applications with commands, flags, and auto-help. It’s a good fit for complex CLI with multiple subcommands – developer tools, automation scripts, and admin utilities – and is used by many major Go tools, like kubectl or helm.\nurfave/cli is easy to learn and suitable for single-command or small CLI tools, as it generates clear help and usage output. It’s most often used for a lightweight CLI or as a replacement for DevOps/utility scripts.\nbubbletea is a modern TUI (text-user interface) framework, used to build interactive or visual CLI apps such as menus, dashboards, progress bars, and more.\nKubernetes\nk8s.io/client-go is the official Go client library for the Kubernetes API, providing clientsets, dynamic clients, discovery, informers, listers, REST, and authentication.\nsigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime wraps client-go and offers manager, reconciler, caches, and webhooks functionalities.\nThe Operator Framework is a high-level scaffolding framework for building Kubernetes operators in Go. It utilizes controller-runtime under the hood and helps generate code, boilerplate, and CRD (custom resource definition) scaffolding.\nsigs.k8s.io/kubebuilder is a framework for building Kubernetes APIs and operators using CRDs.\nIDEs and development environments\nIDEs and editors\n\n\n\n\nThe data indicates that the GoLand IDE, developed by JetBrains, remains the tool of preference for Go development, with 47% of respondents identifying it as their go-to IDE or editor. Approximately 6% of Go developers opt for IntelliJ IDEA with the Go plugin, primarily for its multi-language support.\nThe share of VS Code usage has remained stable recently, while overall editor usage shows a slight increase. Neovim has gained traction as a modern, open-source, and extensible successor to Vim. After Atom was sunset in 2022, its core contributors introduced Zed, an open-source, high-performance editor written in Rust. The proportion of other editors used for Go development has remained largely unchanged and minimal.\nThe most significant changes are associated with the rapid rise of LLMs and the growing demand for AI coding assistants. In 2025, 6% of Go developers identified Cursor – an AI-powered code editor based on VS Code launched in 2023 – as their primary development environment.\nAI coding assistance\nAI-powered coding tools have had a significant impact on the workflows of Go developers. Survey data indicates that, on average, Go developers began adopting AI earlier than their peers using other languages, and they continue to use it more extensively for day-to-day tasks. Currently, more than 70% of Go developers report using at least one AI assistant, agent, or code editor on a regular basis.\nThis high adoption rate is largely explained by the nature of the language itself. Even basic AI-driven code completion and test generation provide significant value when handling boilerplate code in Go. The language’s simplicity, structure, and predictability make it particularly suited to LLM-based code generation.\nHere are the most popular AI coding assistants, agents, and code editors commonly used for Go development in 2025.\n\n\n\n\nNote. This was a multiple-answer question. Results were filtered to include only respondents who stated Go as their main programming language. The table lists only those tools reported as being regularly used by more than 3% of respondents. The AI agents market is evolving rapidly; the data presented here was collected between April and June 2025.\nLinting and static analysis\nGo’s tooling ecosystem is known for its excellent static analysis and linting support. In addition to the tools included in the Go toolchain, several widely adopted solutions are commonly used in professional projects.\nGolangci-lint has become the standard all-in-one linter runner for both CI/CD pipelines and local development. It runs linters in parallel, leverages caching for speed, and is highly configurable.\nMore than one hundred linters are included by default, among them popular options like gosec, govet, revive, errcheck, ineffasign, and staticcheck (a subset of rules), and many teams prefer to run these through golanci-lint.\nGolangci-lint also integrates with all major IDEs, enabling a “shift-left approach”. For example, GoLand natively supports golangci-lint, running golangci-lint inspections in real time as you code and helping to catch issues early.\nAnother notable tool is nilaway, designed to detect potential nil panics in Go code. It is intended for offline use in terminals or CI/CD pipelines. For earlier detection during development, GoLand offers interprocedural analysis for detecting nil pointer dereferences. The nil pointer dereference detector is based on data flow analysis and optimized for incremental and lazy execution, reacting to code changes in real time within the editor.\nConclusion and future outlook for the Go ecosystem\nAs highlighted in our April post Is Golang Still Growing?, the Go ecosystem in 2025 remains healthy, stable, and mature. The language continues to be a leading choice for backend, infrastructure, and cloud-native systems. Go’s emphasis on productivity, security, and simplicity ensures its ongoing relevance and positions it well for further growth in the years ahead.\nMethodology and data\nThe findings presented here are based on the State of Developer Ecosystem Report 2025. Methodology details and raw data are available here. All tables were filtered to include only respondents who identified Go as their primary programming language.",

From hands-on advice to thought-provoking pieces, we’ve gathered a nice selection of stories that will help you stay sharp and inspired in the tech world.\nWe’re also happy to have Josh Long as our featured content author this month! Expect some top-notch insights and a good dose of Spring.\nSo, grab your coffee and dive in – there’s plenty worth reading inside!\nFeatured Content\nJosh Long \nJosh Long works on the Spring team as its number one fan. You can find more of his content – blogs, Youtube content, podcasts, etc. – on his website.\nHi, Spring fans! Spring Boot 4 comes out in November 2025! With this in mind, lLet’s at least look at some of my favorite features together. Jakarta EE 11 is the new baseline. We’ve retained a Java 17 baseline but strongly encourage a Java 25 posture whenever possible. We’ve moved the baseline to GraalVM 25 for native images and updated our Kotlin support to Kotlin 2.2. The new generation of projects assumes the new Jackson 3. We’ve introduced JSpecify nullability annotations across the portfolio to finally eliminate Tony Hoare’s $1 billion dollar mistake – null references. Spring Boot 4 has decomposed the autoconfiguration artifact into smaller, more modular autoconfigurations.\nOne of my favorite new features is API versioning. Here’s a Spring MVC controller with two endpoints, each designated a particular version, the default version of which we can specify with spring.mvc.apiversion.default=1.1.\n@RestController\n\nclass DogsController {\n\n    ...\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\",version=\"1.0\")\n\n    Collection<Map<String, Object>> dogsClassic() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n    @GetMapping(value = \"/dogs\", version = \"1.1\")\n\n    Collection<Dog> dogs() {\n\n        ... \n\n    }\n\n}\nI also love the new easy-mode declarative HTTP clients. Let’s build a client to talk to the Cat Facts API and then activate it using @ImportHttpServices(CatFacts.class):\nrecord CatFact(@JsonProperty(\"fact_number\") int factNumber, String fact) { }\n\nrecord CatFactsResponse(Collection<CatFact> facts) { }\n\ninterface CatFacts {\n\n    @GetExchange(\"https://www.catfacts.net/api\")\n\n    CatFactsResponse facts();\n\n}\nWe built a simple client, and it should work, but what if the service is down? In this case, we can enable resilient methods with Spring’s new @EnableResilientMethods annotation. This gives us two new features: @ConcurrencyLimit and @Retryable (and the related RetryTemplate).\n...\n\n    @ConcurrencyLimit(10)\n\n    @Retryable(maxAttempts = 4, includes = BadException.class)\n\n    @GetMapping(\"/facts\")\n\n    Collection<CatFact> facts()  throws Exception {\n\n        ...\n\n    }\n\n    ...\n    \nSpring Framework 7 brings BeanRegistrar configuration, which is a more dynamic alternative to Java configuration that can be used in conjunction with Java configuration and component scanning with the usual @Import annotation.\nclass MyBeanRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(Runner.class, spec -> spec\n\n                .description(\"description\")\n\n                .supplier(supplierContext -> new Runner(\n\n                        supplierContext.bean(DogRepository.class), supplierContext.beanProvider(CatFacts.class)\n\n                        .getIfUnique())\n\n                ));\n\n    }\n\n}\nSpring Security brings with it a lot of nice new features. Two of my favorites are multi-factor auth, allowing you to require that multiple authentication factors be present, and Customizer<HttpSecurity> beans for additive changes to the HttpSecurity configuration.\n@EnableGlobalMultiFactorAuthentication(\n\n    authorities = { FactorGrantedAuthority.PASSWORD_AUTHORITY, FactorGrantedAuthority.OTT_AUTHORITY })\n\n@Configuration\n\nclass SecurityConfiguration {\n\n    @Bean\n\n    Customizer<HttpSecurity> httpSecurityCustomizer() {\n\n        return httpSecurity -> httpSecurity\n\n                .webAuthn(w -> ... )\n\n                .oneTimeTokenLogin(ott -> ... );\n\n    }\n\n}\nThe code is here for your reference.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Guest post by Urs Peter, Senior Software Engineer and JetBrains-certified Kotlin Trainer. For readers who’d like a more structured way to build Kotlin skills, Urs also leads the Kotlin Upskill Program at Xebia Academy.\nThis is the third post in The Ultimate Guide to Successfully Adopting Kotlin in a Java-Dominated Environment, a series that follows how Kotlin adoption grows among real teams, from a single developer’s curiosity to company-wide transformation.\nAll parts in the series:\nGetting Started With Kotlin for Java Developers\nEvaluating Kotlin in Real Projects\nGrowing Kotlin Adoption in Your Company\nSpread the Word: Win the Hearts and Minds of your Fellow Developers\nBy now, you have a core team convinced of Kotlin’s benefits. Now comes the critical phase: How do you expand adoption? \nKey in this phase is to win the hearts and minds of skeptical Java developers. Hard and soft factors can make the difference here:\nHard factors: the code\nLet the code speak\nSoft factors: support and connect developers\nFacilitate easy onboarding\nOffer self-study material\nEstablish an in-house Kotlin community\nBe patient…\nLet the code speak\nDouble down on the experience you gained by (re-)writing an application in Kotlin and show the benefits in a tangible, accessible way:\nShow, don’t tell: present the gained conciseness of Kotlin by comparing Java with Kotlin snippets. \nZoom out to focus on the overarching paradigms: Kotlin is not just different from Java: Kotlin is built on the foundation of safety, conciseness for maximal readability and maintainability, functions as a first-class citizen, and extensibility, which together solve fundamental shortcomings of Java, while still being fully interoperable with the Java ecosystem.\nHere are some tangible examples:\n1. Null-safety: No more billion-dollar mistakes \nJava\n//This is why we have the billion-dollar mistake (not only in Java…)\nBooking booking = null; //🤨 This is allowed but causes:\nbooking.destination; //Runtime error 😱\n\nOptional<Booking> booking = null; //Optionals aren’t safe from null either: 🤨\nbooking.map(Destination::destination); //Runtime error 😱\nJava has added some null-safety features over time, like Optional and Annotations (@NotNull etc.), but it has failed to solve this fundamental problem. Additionally, project Valhalla (Null-Restricted and Nullable types) will not introduce null-safety to Java, but rather provide more options to choose from. \nKotlin\n//Important to realize that null is very restricted in Kotlin:\nval booking:Booking? = null //…null can only be assigned to Nullable types ✅ \nval booking:Booking = null //null assigned to a Non-nullable types yields a Compilation error 😃 \n\nbooking.destination //unsafely accessing a nullable type directly causes a Compilation error 😃\nbooking?.destination //only safe access is possible  ✅\nThe great thing about Kotlin’s null-safety is that it is not only safe, but also offers great usability. A classic example of “have your cake and eat it, too”:\nSay we have this Domain:\nKotlin\ndata class Booking(val destination:Destination? = null)\ndata class Destination(val hotel:Hotel? = null)\ndata class Hotel(val name:String, val stars:Int? = null)\nJava\npublic record Booking(Optional<Destination> destination) {\n\n   public Booking() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Booking(Destination destination) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(destination));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Destination(Optional<Hotel> hotel) {\n\n   public Destination() { this(Optional.empty()); }\n\n   public Destination(Hotel hotel) {\n       this(Optional.ofNullable(hotel));\n   }\n}\n\npublic record Hotel(String name, Optional<Integer> stars) {\n\n   public Hotel(String name) {\n\n       this(name, Optional.empty());\n\n   }\n\n   public Hotel(String name, Integer stars) {\n       this(name, Optional.ofNullable(stars));\n   }\n}\nConstructing objects\nJava\n//Because Optional is a wrapper, the number of nested objects grows, which doesn’t help readability\nfinal Optional<Booking> booking = Optional.of(new Booking(\n      Optional.of(new Destination(Optional.of(\n            new Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5))))));\nKotlin\n//Since nullability is part of the type system, no wrapper is needed: The required type or null can be used. \nval booking:Booking? = Booking(Destination(Hotel(\"Sunset Paradise\", 5)))\nTraversing nested objects\nJava\n//traversing a graph of Optionals requires extensive unwrapping\nfinal var stars = \"*\".repeat(booking\n                          .flatMap(Booking::getDestination)\n                          .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n                          .map(Hotel::getStars).orElse(0)); //-> \"*****\"\nKotlin\n//Easily traverse a graph of nullable types with: ‘?’, use  ?: for the ‘else’ case.\nval stars = \"*\".repeat(booking?.destination?.hotel?.stars ?: 0) //-> \"*****\"\nUnwrap nested object\nJava\n//extensive unwrapping is also needed for printing a leaf \nbooking.getDestination()\n       .flatMap(Destination::getHotel)\n       .map(Hotel::getName)\n       .map(String::toUpperCase)\n         .ifPresent(System.out::println);\nKotlin\n//In Kotlin we have two elegant options:\n//1. we can again traverse the graph with ‘?’\nbooking?.destination?.hotel.?name?.uppercase()?.also(::println)\n\n//2. We can make use of Kotlin’s smart-cast feature\nif(booking?.destination?.hotel != null) {\n   //The compiler has checked that all the elements in the object graph are not null, so we can access the elements as if they were non-nullable types\n   println(booking.destination.hotel.uppercase())\n}\nThe lack of null-safety support in Java is a key pain-point for developers, leading to defensive programming, different nullability constructs (or none at all), including increased verbosity. Moreover, NullPointerExceptions are responsible for roughly one-third of application crashes (The JetBrains Blog). Kotlin’s compile-time null checking prevents these runtime failures entirely. That’s why, still today, Null-safety is the primary driver for migration to Kotlin.\n2. Collections are your friend, not your enemy\nThe creator of Spring, Rod Johnson, stated in a recent interview that it was not Nullable-types that made him try out Kotlin, but the overly complicated Java Streams API: Creator of Spring: No desire to write Java. \nThe following example depicts the various reasons why the Java Streams API is so horribly complicated and how Kotlin solves all of the issues:\nJava\npublic record Product(String name, int... ratings){}\nList<Product> products = List.of(\n  new Product(\"gadget\", 9, 8, 7), \n  new Product(\"goody\", 10, 9)\n);\n\nMap<String, Integer> maxRatingsPerProduct =\n\n   //🤨 1. Stream introduces indirection\n   products.stream()\n     //🤨 1. Always to and from Stream conversion\n      .collect(\n        //🤨 2. Lacks extension methods, so wrappers are required\n        Collectors.groupingBy(\n           Product::name,\n            //🤨 2. Again…\n           Collectors.mapping( groupedProducts ->\n                //🤨 3. (too) low-level types, arrays, and primitives cause extra complexity\n                //🤨 4. No API on Array, always wrap in stream \n               Arrays.stream(groupedProducts.ratings())\n                   .max()\n                      //🤨 5. Extra verbosity due to Optional\n                      .orElse(0.0),\n               //🤨 6. No named arguments: what does this do?\n                Collectors.reducing(0, Integer::max)\n              )\n            ));\nKotlin\n//😃 rich and uniform Collection API - even on Java collections - due to extension methods\nval maxRatingsPerProduct = products.\n      .groupBy { it.name }\n      .mapValues { (_, groupedProducts) -> //😃 destructuring for semantic precision\n            //😃 built-in nullability support, and the same API for \n            //arrays like other Collections\n            groupedProducts.flatMap { it.ratings }\n                  .maxOrNull() ?: 0 \n            }\n      }\nDue to Kotlin’s uniform Collection framework, converting between different collection types is very straightforward:\nJava\nint[] numbers = {1, 3, 3, 5, 2};\n\nSet<Integer> unique = Arrays.stream(numbers).boxed().collect(Collectors.toSet());\n\nMap<Integer, Boolean> evenOrOdd = unique.stream()\n       .collect(Collectors.toMap(\n               n -> n,\n               n -> n % 2 == 0));\nKotlin\nval numbers = arrayOf(1, 3, 3, 5, 2)\n\nval unique: Set<Int> = numbers.toSet() //😃 simply call to<Collection> to do the conversion\n\nval evenOrOdd: Map<Int, Boolean> = unique.associateWith { it % 2 == 0 }\nNet effect:\nFeature-rich, intuitive Collection API: pipelines read left-to-right like English, not inside nested collector calls.\nLess boilerplate and complexity: no Collectors.groupingBy, no Stream, no Optional, no Arrays.stream.\nOne mental model: whether you start with a List, Set, Array, or primitive array, you reach for the same collection operators.\nPerformance without pain: the compiler inserts boxing/unboxing only where unavoidable; you write normal code.\n​​Null-safety integrated: Collection API fully supports nullability with various helpers often suffixed with orNull(...).\nSeamless Java-interop with idiomatic wrappers: Due to extension methods, you get the “best of both worlds” – feature-rich Collections on top of Java collections.\nPut simply, Kotlin lifts the everyday collection tasks – filtering, mapping, grouping etc. – into first-class, composable functions, so you express what you want, not the ceremony of how to get there.\n3. No more checked Exceptions, yet safer code in Kotlin\nJava is one of the only languages that still supports checked Exceptions. Though initially implemented as a safety feature, they have not lived up to their promise. Their verbosity, pointless catch blocks that do nothing or rethrow as an Exception as a RuntimeException, and their misalignment with lambdas are a few reasons why they get in the way rather than making your code safer.\nKotlin follows the proven paradigm used by almost all other programming languages –C#, Python, Scala, Rust, and Go – of using exceptions only for unrecoverable situations.\nThe following examples highlight the obstacles that checked Exceptions introduce into your code, without adding any safety:\nJava\npublic String downloadAndGetLargestFile(List<String> urls) {\n   List<String> contents = urls.stream().map(urlStr -> {\n               Optional<URL> optional;\n               try {\n                   optional = Optional.of(new URI(urlStr).toURL());\n                   //🤨 Within lambdas checked exceptions are not supported and must always be caught...\n               } catch (URISyntaxException | MalformedURLException e) {\n                   optional = Optional.empty();\n               }\n               return optional;\n           }).filter(Optional::isPresent)       //Quite a mouthful to get rid of the Optional...\n           .map(Optional::get)\n           .map(url -> {\n               try (InputStream is = url.openStream()) {\n                   return new String(is.readAllBytes(), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n               } catch (IOException e) {\n                   //🤨… or re-thrown, which is annoying, I don’t really care about IOE\n                   throw new IllegalArgumentException(e);\n               }\n           }).toList();\n   //🤨 An empty List results in a NoSuchElementException, so why is it not checked? The chance that the List is empty is as high as the other two cases above...\n   return Collections.max(contents);\n}\nKotlin\n//😃 safe return type\nfun downloadAndGetLargestFile(urls: List<String>): String? =\n   urls.mapNotNull {    //😃 convenient utility methods to rid of null\n       //😃 try catch is possible, yet runCatching is an elegant way to convert an exception to null\n       runCatching { URI(it).toURL() }.getOrNull()\n   }.maxOfOrNull{  //😃 safe way to retrieve the max value\n       it.openStream().use{ it.reader().readText() }  //😃 convenient extension methods to make java.io streams fluent\n   }\n4. Functions as first-class citizens\nKotlin treats functions as first-class citizens, which may raise questions if you’re coming from Java: What does that mean, and why does it matter?\nThe key difference lies in Java’s limited approach – its functional capabilities focus mostly on the call-site via lambdas, while the declaration-side remains tied to verbose and less intuitive functional interfaces. In Kotlin, you can define, pass, return, and compose functions without any boilerplate, making functional programming far more expressive and natural.\nJava\npublic void doWithImage(\n      URL url, \n      //🤨 Function interfaces introduce an indirection: because we don’t see the signature of a Function we don’t know what a  BiConsumer does, unless we look it up\n      BiConsumer<String, BufferedImage> f) throws IOException {\n        f.accept(url.getFile(), ImageIO.read(url));\n}\n\n//🤨 Same here\npublic void debug(Supplier<String> f) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled()) {\n      logger.debug(\"Debug: \" + f.get());\n   }\n}\n\n//🤨 calling no-argument lambdas is verbose\ndebug(() -> \"expensive concat\".repeat(1000));\nKotlin\nfun doWithImage(\n   url: URL,\n  //😃 Kotlin has a syntax for declaring functions: from the signature, we see what goes in and what goes out \n   f:(String, BufferedImage) -> Unit) = \n      f(url.file, ImageIO.read(url))\n\n  //😃 same here: nothing goes in, a String goes out\nfun debug(msg: () -> String) {\n   if(isDebugEnabled) {\n            logger.debug(msg())\n   }\n}\n\n//😃 convenient syntax to pass a lambda: {<lambda body>}\ndebug{\"expensive concat\".repeat(1000)}\nKotlin provides a clear and concise syntax for declaring functions – just from the signature, you can immediately see what goes in and what comes out, without having to navigate to an external functional interface. \nJava “leaks” its functional programming features through a large set of java.util.function.* interfaces with verbose and complex signatures, which often makes functional programming cumbersome to use. Kotlin, by contrast, treats functions as first-class citizens: these interfaces remain hidden from the developer, yet remain fully interoperable with Java’s approach:\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, using functions in Kotlin is significantly more straightforward and intuitive, which lowers the threshold considerably for leveraging this powerful programming concept in your own code. \n5. Headache-free concurrency with coroutines\nIf you need high throughput, parallel processing within a single request, or streaming, the only option you have in Java is a reactive library, like Reactor and RxJava, available in frameworks like Spring WebFlux, Vert.X, Quarkus etc.\nThe problem with these libraries is that they are notoriously complicated, forcing you into functional programming. As such, they have a steep learning curve, yet it is very easy to make errors that can have dire consequences when the application is under load. That’s most probably why reactive programming never became mainstream. \nNote: VirtualThreads are not a replacement for reactive libraries, even though there is some overlap. VirtualThreads offer non-blocking I/O, but do not provide features such as parallel processing or reactive streams. Structured concurrency and Scoped Values will also enable parallel processing once the major frameworks have support for it. For reactive streams, you will always have to rely on a reactive library.\n\r\n\n        \nSo let’s assume you are a Java developer using Spring Boot and you want to make a parallel call within a single request. This is what you end up with: \n@PostMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\npublic Mono<User> storeUser(@RequestBody User user) {\n   Mono<URL> avatarMono = avatarService.randomAvatar();\n   Mono<Boolean> validEmailMono = emailService.verifyEmail(user.getEmail());\n   //🤨 what does ‘zip’ do?\n   return Mono.zip(avatarMono, validEmailMono).flatMap(tuple -> \n       if(!tuple.getT2()) //what is getT2()? It’s the validEmail Boolean…\n        //🤨 why can I not just throw an exception?\n         Mono.error(new InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid Email\"));\n       else personDao.save(UserBuilder.from(user)\n                                          .withAvatarUrl(tuple.getT1()));\n     );  \n  }\nEven though, from a runtime perspective, this code performs perfectly well, the accidental complexity introduced is enormous: \nThe code is dominated by Mono/Flux-es, throughout the whole call chain, which enforces you to wrap all domain objects.\nThere are many complex operators everywhere, like zip, flatMap, etc.\nYou cannot use standard programming constructs like throwing exceptions \nThe business intent of your code suffers significantly: the code focuses on Monos and flatMap, thereby obscuring what is truly happening from a business perspective.\nThe good news is that there is a powerful remedy in the form of Kotlin Coroutines. Coroutines can be framed as a reactive implementation on the language level. As such, they combine the best of both worlds: \nYou write sequential code like you did before.\nThe code is executed asynchronously / in parallel at runtime.\nThe above Java code converted to coroutines looks as follows:\n@GetMapping(\"/users\")\n@ResponseBody\n@Transactional\nsuspend fun storeUser(@RequestBody user:User):User = coroutineScope {\n   val avatarUrl = async { avatarService.randomAvatar() }\n   val validEmail = async { emailService.verifyEmail() }\n   if(!validEmail.await()) throw InvalidEmailException(\"Invalid email\")\n   personRepo.save(user.copy(avatar = avatarUrl.await()))\n}\nKotlin’s suspend keyword enables structured, non-blocking execution in a clear and concise manner. Together with async{} and await(), it facilitates parallel processing without the need for deeply nested callbacks or complex constructs such as Mono or CompletableFuture.\nThat’s why complexity will decrease, and developer joy and maintainability will increase, with the exact same performance characteristics. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Not all major Java-based web frameworks support Coroutines as well. Spring does an excellent job, as does Micronaut. Quarkus currently offers limited Coroutine support.\n6. But hey, Java is evolving too!\nJava keeps moving forward with features like records, pattern matching, and upcoming projects such as Amber, Valhalla, and Loom. This steady evolution strengthens the JVM and benefits the entire ecosystem.\nBut here’s the catch: most of these “new” Java features are things Kotlin developers have enjoyed for years. Null safety, value classes, top-level functions, default arguments, concise collections, and first-class functions are all baked into Kotlin’s design – delivered in a more unified and developer-friendly way. That’s why Kotlin code often feels cleaner, safer, and far more productive.\nAnd there is more: Kotlin also profits from Java’s innovation. JVM-level advances like Virtual Threads and Loom in general, or Valhalla’s performance boosts apply seamlessly to Kotlin too.\nIn short: Java evolves, but Kotlin was designed from day one to give developers the modern tools they need – making it a safe, modern, and forward-looking choice for building the future.\n\n\n\n\n7. Kotlin’s evolutionary advantage\nOlder programming languages inevitably carry legacy baggage compared to modern alternatives. Updating a language while supporting massive existing codebases presents unique challenges for language designers. Kotlin enjoys two crucial advantages:\nStanding on the shoulders of giants: Rather than reinventing the wheel, Kotlin’s initial design team gathered proven paradigms from major programming languages and unified them into a cohesive whole. This approach maximized evolutionary learning from the broader programming community.\nLearning from Java’s shortcomings: Kotlin’s designers could observe Java’s pitfalls and develop solid solutions from the ground up.\nFor deeper insights into Kotlin’s evolution, Andrey Breslav from Kotlin’s original design team gave an excellent talk at KotlinDevDay Amsterdam: Shoulders of Giants: Languages Kotlin Learned From – Andrey Breslav\nSoft factors: Support and connect developers in their Kotlin adoption journey\n1. Facilitate easy onboarding\nThe goal of the expressive Java vs. Kotlin code snippets is to whet the appetite for Kotlin. Code alone, however, is not enough to win the hearts and minds of Java developers. To accelerate adoption and ensure a smooth start, provide:\nSample project: A ready-to-run project with both Java and Kotlin code side-by-side, giving teams a practical reference during migration.\n\n\n\n\nBuilt-in quality checks: Preconfigured with tools like SonarQube, ktlint, and detekt to promote clean, consistent, and maintainable code from day one. This will enable you to apply consistent lint rules, testing frameworks, libraries, and CI pipelines to reduce friction across teams.\n\n\n\n\nCoaching and support: Experienced Kotlin engineers available to coach new teams, answer questions, and provide hands-on advice during the early stages of development.\n\nThis one is particularly important: with only a few hours of guidance from an experienced developer from another team who has gone through these stages before, much damage and technical debt can be prevented. \nA bit of support and coaching is the most powerful way to nurture lasting enthusiasm for Kotlin.\n2. Offer (self-)study material\nEspecially when coming from Java, learning the Kotlin basics can be done on your own. Providing some resources upfront eases the path to getting productive with Kotlin and lowers the threshold. \nJetBrains “Tour of Kotlin” (Get Started guide)\nA short, browser-based tutorial on the official Kotlin site.\nKotlin Koans\nA set of bite-sized coding challenges maintained by JetBrains.\nUdacity “Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers”\nA full video-based course created in partnership with Google.\nNote: Although self-study is valuable for grasping the basics, it also has some drawbacks. One of these drawbacks is an optionality: being caught up in the day’s frenzy, it’s tempting to skip self-study. Moreover, you will lack feedback from a practitioner who knows the subtle nuances of correctly applied idiomatic Kotlin. There is a big chance that after a self-study course, you will write Java-ish Kotlin, which gives you some benefits but does not unlock the full potential of the language. \nUnless you don’t have good coaching, a classical course can be very beneficial. There is a need to attend; you can exchange with peers of the same level and have your questions answered by an experienced professional, which will get you up to speed much faster with less non-idiomatic Kotlin during the initial transition. \n3. Establish an in-house Kotlin community\nOne of the fastest ways to level up Kotlin expertise across your company is to create and foremost nurture an in-house community.\nLaunch an internal Kotlin community\n\nFirst look for a core-team of at least 3–6 developers who are willing to invest in a Kotlin community. Also ensure they get time and credits from their managers for their task.\nOnce the team is formed, organize a company-wide kick-off with well-known speakers from the Kotlin community. This will ignite the Kotlin flame and give it momentum.\nSchedule regular meet-ups (monthly or bi-weekly) so momentum never drops.\nCreate a shared chat channel/wiki where questions, code snippets, and event notes live.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvite (external) speakers\n\nBring in engineers who’ve shipped Kotlin in production to share candid war stories.\nAlternate between deep-dive technical talks (coroutines, KMP, functional programming) and higher-level case studies (migration strategies, tooling tips).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresent lessons learned from other in-house projects\n\nAsk project leads to present their Kotlin learnings – what worked, what didn’t, and measurable outcomes.\nThese insights can be captured in a “Kotlin playbook” that new teams can pick up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive your own developers the stage\n\nRun lightning-talk sessions where anyone can demo a neat trick, library, or failure they overcame in 5–10 minutes.\nCelebrate contributors publicly – shout-outs in all-hands or internal newsletters boost engagement and knowledge-sharing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep feedback loops tight\n\nAfter each session, collect quick polls on clarity and usefulness, then tweak future agendas accordingly.\nRotate organizational duties so the community doesn’t hinge on a single champion and stays resilient long-term.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Many of the suggestions above sound straightforward. However, the effort needed to keep a community vibrant and alive should not be underestimated. \n4. Be patient…\nCultural change takes time. The danger of being enthusiastic about a tool that makes a difference for you is pushing things, which can be counterproductive. An effective approach is to nurture the adoption process with all the activities discussed above, with show, don’t tell as prior guidance.\nUp next in the series\nWe shift focus from convincing developers to persuading decision-makers. The next post shows how to build a compelling business case for Kotlin adoption, grounded in real data and measurable outcomes. You’ll learn how to translate developer wins into management arguments, link productivity gains to cost savings, and demonstrate why Kotlin is more than a technical upgrade – it’s a strategic move for teams and companies alike.\nUrs Peter\nUrs is a seasoned software engineer, solution architect, conference speaker, and trainer with over 20 years of experience in building resilient, scalable, and mission-critical systems, mostly involving Kotlin and Scala.\nBesides his job as a consultant, he is also a passionate trainer and author of a great variety of courses ranging from language courses for Kotlin and Scala to architectural trainings such as Microservices and Event-Driven Architectures.\nAs a people person by nature, he loves to share knowledge and inspire and get inspired by peers on meetups and conferences.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "This is a guest post from Dido Grigorov, a deep learning engineer and Python programmer with 17 years of experience in the field.\n\n\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving domain of software development, Python has established itself as a premier language, renowned for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It underpins a vast range of applications, from web development to artificial intelligence and data engineering. However, beneath its elegant syntax lies a potential challenge: performance bottlenecks that can transform otherwise efficient scripts into noticeably sluggish processes.\nWhether the task involves processing large datasets, developing real-time systems, or refining computational efficiency, optimizing Python code for speed can be a decisive factor in achieving superior results.\nThis guide presents 10 rigorously tested performance-enhancement strategies. Drawing upon Python’s built-in capabilities, efficient data structures, and low-level optimization techniques, it offers practical methods to accelerate code execution without compromising the language’s characteristic clarity and elegance. Supported by empirical benchmarks and illustrative code examples, these techniques demonstrate how incremental improvements can yield substantial performance gains – empowering developers to transition from proficient practitioners to true experts in high-performance Python programming.\nLet’s dive in and turbocharge your Python prowess!\nHack 1: Leverage sets for membership testing\nWhen you need to check whether an element exists within a collection, using a list can be inefficient – especially as the size of the list grows. Membership testing with a list (x in some_list) requires scanning each element one by one, resulting in linear time complexity (O(n)):\nbig_list = list(range(1000000))\nbig_set = set(big_list)\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_list)\nprint(f\"List lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nprint(999999 in big_set)\nprint(f\"Set lookup: {time.time() - start:.6f}s\")\nTime measured:\nList lookup: ~0.015000s\nSet lookup: ~0.000020s\nIn contrast, sets in Python are implemented as hash tables, which allow for constant-time (O(1)) lookups on average. This means that checking whether a value exists in a set is significantly faster, especially when dealing with large datasets.\nFor tasks like filtering duplicates, validating input, or cross-referencing elements between collections, sets are far more efficient than lists. They not only speed up membership tests but also make operations like unions, intersections, and differences much faster and more concise.\nBy switching from lists to sets for membership checks – particularly in performance-critical code – you can achieve meaningful speed gains with minimal changes to your logic.\nHack 2: Avoid unnecessary copies\nCopying large objects like lists, dictionaries, or arrays can be costly in both time and memory. Each copy creates a new object in memory, which can lead to significant overhead, especially when working with large datasets or within tight loops.\nWhenever possible, modify objects in place instead of creating duplicates. This reduces memory usage and improves performance by avoiding the overhead of allocating and populating new structures. Many built-in data structures in Python provide in-place methods (e.g. sort, append, update) that eliminate the need for copies.\nnumbers = list(range(1000000))\ndef modify_list(lst):\n    lst[0] = 999\n    return lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = modify_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"In-place: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef copy_list(lst):\n    new_lst = lst.copy()\n    new_lst[0] = 999\n    return new_lst\nstart = time.time()\nresult = copy_list(numbers)\nprint(f\"Copy: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nIn-place: ~0.0001s\nCopy: ~0.0100s\nIn performance-critical code, being mindful of when and how objects are duplicated can make a noticeable difference. By working with references and in-place operations, you can write more efficient and memory-friendly code, particularly when handling large or complex data structures.\nHack 3: Use __slots__ for memory efficiency\nBy default, Python classes store instance attributes in a dynamic dictionary (__dict__), which offers flexibility but comes with memory overhead and slightly slower attribute access.\nUsing __slots__ allows you to explicitly declare a fixed set of attributes for a class. This eliminates the need for a __dict__, reducing memory usage – which is especially beneficial when creating many instances of a class. It also leads to marginally faster attribute access due to the simplified internal structure.\nWhile __slots__ does restrict dynamic attribute assignment, this trade-off is often worthwhile in memory-constrained environments or performance-sensitive applications. For lightweight classes or data containers, applying __slots__ is a simple way to make your code more efficient.\nclass Point:\n    __slots__ = ('x', 'y')\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\nstart = time.time()\npoints = [Point(i, i+1) for i in range(1000000)]\nprint(f\"With slots: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nWith __slots__: ~0.1200s\nWithout __slots__: ~0.1500s\nHack 4: Use math functions instead of operators\nFor numerical computations, Python’s math module provides functions that are implemented in C, offering better performance and precision than equivalent operations written in pure Python.\nFor example, using math.sqrt() is typically faster and more accurate than raising a number to the power of 0.5 using the exponentiation (**) operator. Similarly, functions like math.sin(), math.exp(), and math.log() are highly optimized for speed and reliability.\nThese performance benefits become especially noticeable in tight loops or large-scale calculations. By relying on the math module for heavy numerical work, you can achieve both faster execution and more consistent results – making it the preferred choice for scientific computing, simulations, or any math-heavy code.\n\n\n\n\nPyCharm makes it even easier to take advantage of the math module by providing intelligent code completion. Simply typing math. triggers a dropdown list of all available mathematical functions and constants – such as sqrt(), sin(), cos(), log(), pi, and many more – along with inline documentation. \nThis not only speeds up development by reducing the need to memorize function names, but also encourages the use of optimized, built-in implementations over custom or operator-based alternatives. By leveraging these hints, developers can quickly explore the full breadth of the module and write cleaner, faster numerical code with confidence.\nimport math\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [math.sqrt(n) for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Math sqrt: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nroots = [n ** 0.5 for n in numbers]\nprint(f\"Operator: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nmath.sqrt: ~0.2000s\nOperator: ~0.2500s\nHack 5: Pre-allocate memory with known sizes\nWhen building lists or arrays dynamically, Python resizes them in the background as they grow. While convenient, this resizing involves memory allocation and data copying, which adds overhead – especially in large or performance-critical loops.\nIf you know the final size of your data structure in advance, pre-allocating memory can significantly improve performance. By initializing a list or array with a fixed size, you avoid repeated resizing and allow Python (or libraries like NumPy) to manage memory more efficiently.\nThis technique is particularly valuable in numerical computations, simulations, and large-scale data processing, where even small optimizations can add up. Pre-allocation helps reduce fragmentation, improves cache locality, and ensures more predictable performance.\nstart = time.time()\nresult = [0] * 1000000\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result[i] = i\nprint(f\"Pre-allocated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor i in range(1000000):\n    result.append(i)\nprint(f\"Dynamic: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nPre-allocated: ~0.0300s\nDynamic: ~0.0400s\nHack 6: Avoid exception handling in hot loops\nWhile Python’s exception handling is powerful and clean for managing unexpected behavior, it’s not designed for high-frequency use inside performance-critical loops. Raising and catching exceptions involves stack unwinding and context switching, which are relatively expensive operations.\nIn hot loops – sections of code that run repeatedly or process large volumes of data – using exceptions for control flow can significantly degrade performance. Instead, use conditional checks (if, in, is, etc.) to prevent errors before they occur. This proactive approach is much faster and leads to more predictable execution.\nReserving exceptions for truly exceptional cases, rather than expected control flow, results in cleaner and faster code – especially in tight loops or real-time applications where performance matters.\nnumbers = list(range(10000000))\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    if i % 2 != 0:\n        total += i // 2\n    else:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Conditional: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\ntotal = 0\nfor i in numbers:\n    try:\n        total += i / (i % 2)\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\n        total += i\nprint(f\"Exception: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nConditional: ~0.3000s\nException: ~0.6000s\nHack 7: Use local functions for repeated logic\nWhen a specific piece of logic is used repeatedly within a function, defining it as a local (nested) function – also known as a closure – can improve performance and organization. Local functions benefit from faster name resolution because Python looks up variables more quickly in local scopes than in global ones.\nIn addition to the performance gain, local functions help encapsulate logic, making your code cleaner and more modular. They can also capture variables from the enclosing scope, allowing you to write more flexible and reusable inner logic without passing extra arguments.\nThis technique is particularly useful in functions that apply the same operation multiple times, such as loops, data transformations, or recursive processes. By keeping frequently used logic local, you reduce both runtime overhead and cognitive load.\nHint: Use AI Assistant’s Suggest Refactoring\nIf you’re using PyCharm (or any JetBrains product) with the AI Assistant plugin, one particularly powerful tool is Suggest Refactoring. With it, you can select a segment of code, invoke the AI Assistant, and ask it to propose cleaner or more efficient alternatives – all in one go. \nThe assistant shows you a “refactored” version of your code, lets you view the diff (what would change), and you can accept either selected snippets or the whole block. This helps maintain consistency, enforce best practices, and catch opportunities for improvement you might otherwise miss.\n\n\n\n\nHow to use Suggest Refactoring\nHere are step-by-step instructions (as per JetBrains’ documentation) on how to use this feature:\nSelect the code fragment you want to refactor.\n\n\n\n\nWhen the popup appears (e.g. small lightbulb or context menu), click the AI Assistant icon.\n\n\n\n\nChoose Suggest Refactoring in the menu.\n\n\n\n\nThe AI Chat pane then opens with its proposed refactorings. In it, you can:\nClick Show Diff to compare the original against the proposed code.\n\n\n\n\nOr if you prefer, you can select Apply Immediately to skip the diff and apply the suggestion directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you like the suggested changes, click Accept on individual snippets (in the gutter) or Accept All to replace the entire selected fragment.\n\n\n\n\nIf you don’t like the suggestions, you can always close the diff or dialog without applying.\ndef outer():\n    def add_pair(a, b):\n        return a + b\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(10000000):\n        result = add_pair(result, i)\n    return result\nstart = time.time()\nresult = outer()\nprint(f\"Local function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\ndef add_pair(a, b):\n    return a + b\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(10000000):\n    result = add_pair(result, i)\nprint(f\"Global function: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nLocal function: ~0.4000s\nGlobal function: ~0.4500s\nHack 8: Use itertools for combinatorial operations\nWhen dealing with permutations, combinations, Cartesian products, or other iterator-based tasks, Python’s itertools module provides a suite of highly efficient, C-optimized tools tailored for these use cases.\nFunctions like product(), permutations(), combinations(), and combinations_with_replacement() generate elements lazily, meaning they don’t store the entire result in your computer’s memory. This allows you to work with large or infinite sequences without the performance or memory penalties of manual implementations.\nIn addition to being fast, itertools functions are composable and memory-efficient, making them ideal for complex data manipulation, algorithm development, and problem-solving tasks like those found in simulations, search algorithms, or competitive programming. When performance and scalability matter, itertools is a go-to solution.\nfrom itertools import product\nitems = [1, 2, 3] * 10\nstart = time.time()\nresult = list(product(items, repeat=2))\nprint(f\"Itertools: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = []\nfor x in items:\n    for y in items:\n        result.append((x, y))\nprint(f\"Loops: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nitertools: ~0.0005s\nLoops: ~0.0020s\nHack 9: Use bisect for sorted list operations\nWhen working with sorted lists, using linear search or manual insertion logic can be inefficient – especially as the list grows. Python’s bisect module provides fast, efficient tools for maintaining sorted order using binary search.\nWith functions like bisect_left(), bisect_right(), and insort(), you can perform insertions and searches in O(log n) time, as opposed to the O(n) complexity of a simple scan. This is particularly useful in scenarios like maintaining leaderboards, event timelines, or implementing efficient range queries.\nBy using bisect, you avoid re-sorting after every change and gain a significant performance boost when working with dynamic, sorted data. It’s a lightweight and powerful tool that brings algorithmic efficiency to common list operations.\nimport bisect\nnumbers = sorted(list(range(0, 1000000, 2)))\nstart = time.time()\nbisect.insort(numbers, 75432)\nprint(f\"Bisect: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nfor i, num in enumerate(numbers):\n    if num > 75432:\n        numbers.insert(i, 75432)\n        break\nprint(f\"Loop: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nbisect: ~0.0001s\nLoop: ~0.0100s\nHack 10: Avoid repeated function calls in loops\nCalling the same function multiple times inside a loop – especially if the function is expensive or produces the same result each time – can lead to unnecessary overhead. Even relatively fast functions can accumulate significant cost when called repeatedly in large loops.\nTo optimize, compute the result once outside the loop and store it in a local variable. This reduces function call overhead and improves runtime efficiency, particularly in performance-critical sections of code.\nThis technique is simple but effective. It not only speeds up execution but also enhances code clarity by signaling that the value is constant within the loop’s context. Caching function results is one of the easiest ways to eliminate redundant computation and make your code more efficient.\ndef expensive_operation():\n    time.sleep(0.001)\n    return 42\nstart = time.time()\ncached_value = expensive_operation()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += cached_value\nprint(f\"Cached: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\n\nstart = time.time()\nresult = 0\nfor i in range(1000):\n    result += expensive_operation()\nprint(f\"Repeated: {time.time() - start:.4f}s\")\nTime measured:\nCached: ~0.0010s\nRepeated: ~1.0000s\nIn summary\nFrom leveraging the inherent efficiency of Python’s built-in functions and high-performance libraries such as NumPy to employing memory-conscious techniques with __slots__ and generators, these fifteen Python performance strategies provide a comprehensive set of tools for enhancing execution speed. \nThe methods explored include optimizing iterative processes with comprehensions, utilizing sets for rapid membership checks, avoiding unnecessary data copies and exception handling overhead, and applying bitwise operations as arithmetic shortcuts.\nSpecialized modules such as itertools, bisect, and collections further streamline complex tasks, while adherence to best practices – such as minimizing the use of global variables, pre-allocating memory, and implementing caching – ensures lean, efficient code execution. Empirical benchmarks demonstrate that even minor adjustments can yield significant time savings in large-scale operations, reinforcing the principle that effective optimization does not necessitate a complete code rewrite.\nWhether refining a standalone script or scaling a production-level application, these techniques, when applied judiciously, can significantly enhance performance while conserving system resources. Ultimately, the most effective optimizations strike a balance between speed and clarity.\nAbout the author\nDido Grigorov\nDido is a seasoned Deep Learning Engineer and Python programmer with an impressive 17 years of experience in the field.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "PhpStorm comes with a ton of built-in features, and you can add even more with plugins. They bring new languages, tools, and small improvements that make everyday coding smoother.\nMany of the best ones come from independent developers. One of them is Dmitrii Derepko, who built several handy tools for working with web projects and PHP. Below are a few of his creations worth checking out.\nIf you’re curious about plugin development, don’t miss the JetBrains Plugin Developer Conference 2025  – free online conference. Dmitrii will be speaking there and will walk you through plugin creation basics: from the initial setup to releasing it on JetBrains Marketplace.\n.​gitattributes support\n\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever worked with libraries distributed through Composer, NPM, or other package managers, you’ve probably seen a .gitattributes file. It controls how your project looks when archived (via git archive) and which files get included or excluded when users install your package.\nThe .gitattributes Support plugin adds first-class editing experience for this file in PhpStorm. It highlights syntax, recognizes attribute rules, and even suggests valid options while you type so you don’t have to look them up each time. Small details, but they make editing smoother and help prevent mistakes.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nGit Codeowners\n\n\n\n\nIf you use GitHub or GitLab, you’ve probably seen a CODEOWNERS file. It tells your platform who’s responsible for reviewing pull requests that touch specific parts of the codebase.\nThe Git CODEOWNERS plugin makes editing this file painless. It autocompletes file paths, suggests team names, and validates syntax to prevent mistakes before you commit.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nCron / Crontab Support\n\n\n\n\nCron is the classic tool for running tasks on a schedule. But remembering its five-field syntax is… painful.\nThis plugin highlights errors in your cron expressions, translates them into plain English (“runs every Monday at 3 AM”), and even lets you execute commands directly from PhpStorm – no need to switch to the terminal.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nSitemap Support\n\n\n\n\nSitemaps tell search engines which URLs your site exposes and when they were last updated.\nThis plugin gives you a table-like XML editor for editing and inspecting sitemap files. You can view indexed vs. non-indexed pages, search or filter entries, and tweak URLs by hand if your generator misses something.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nTempestPHP\nA work-in-progress plugin that adds support for Tempest (an upcoming new PHP framework) to PhpStorm. Features include support for its custom view syntax, route- and view file support, autocompletion for database models, and more.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace \n💻 Source code on GitHub\nBuggregator\n\n\n\n\nBuggregator is a visual debugging toolkit that lets you inspect data dumps right inside PhpStorm. \nJust call trap() in your PHP code, and the plugin automatically spins up a local server that listens for these calls and renders the data in a docked panel — no browser tabs, no context switching.\nIt also works seamlessly with the libraries you already use, like Ray, Symfony/VarDumper, Monolog, Sentry, etc.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nPHP Dump\n\n\n\n\nPHP Dump builds on PHP Opcodes Language to visualize your code’s compiled output in real time.\nIt tokenizes the current file, shows the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), and displays Opcache details. It helps you understand why a specific function might run slower than expected, without ever executing it.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nFileSystem Info\n\n\n\n\nSometimes you just want to know which files in your project are taking up space or sitting forgotten.\nFileSystem Info scans your project tree and adds file sizes in the project structure tree so you can quickly spot large files.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\nGit Churn\n\n\n\n\nGit Churn shows you which files in your repository change too often or never change at all.\nFrequent edits usually signal overly complex or unstable code. This plugin helps you spot those hotspots so you can refactor with purpose instead of guesswork.\n🔗 Plugin Marketplace\n💻 Source on GitHub\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for this roundup – a few plugins that make PhpStorm just a bit smarter.\nIf you ever had an idea for a PhpStorm plugin or run into something that could be automated or improved, drop it in the comments – maybe Dmitrii (or someone else from the community) will take it on next!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Modern IDEs are powerful tools with many useful features. When we talk about developer productivity, one thing that comes to mind is mastering the IDE – learning its features, like refactorings, navigation, or code generation, and remembering how to invoke them.\nHowever, discovering all the relevant features of your IDE, and knowing when and how to use them can be challenging. Once you know a given feature exists, there are different ways to invoke it:\n Shortcuts are fast, but it is hard to remember all of them.\n Search Everywhere (⇧⇧) is great, but it pulls you out of your flow.\n Intention actions (Alt+Enter) help, but they are discoverable only when the IDE points them out.\nOur research shows that most developers can only confidently recall a few shortcuts, for example (often three or fewer). The number of useful IDE actions we need is far greater than this. When the right shortcut is hard to find or remember, we rely on menus, hints, and other visual helpers. That’s how IDEs have evolved for years: layering discoverability tools around a keyboard-driven core.\nOne feature every developer does use is code completion. Start typing, and the IDE suggests keywords, variables, or method names. Press the dot button (.) and see relevant API members and templates – it’s so natural that modern development feels impossible without it. Now, we aim to extend this familiar experience beyond code – to the IDE itself. This way, you can discover and execute actions the same way you complete code: context-aware, inline, and without breaking your flow.\n\n\nA brief overview of the command completion feature\n\n\n\nIntroducing command completion\nTo help you unlock the full potential of your IDE, we are offering a universal entry point to relevant actions. \nCommand completion is our attempt to provide a new way to access context-aware actions directly from your editor. It extends the existing code completion (accessible via .) that many developers are already using. Command completion works like regular completion, but in addition to classes, methods, and templates, the popup also suggests actions relevant to your current context.\nType . to see code completion, postfix completion, and action suggestions.\nType .. to filter completion suggestions to actions only.\nSelect the action to see the exact context and preview what the action will do if applied.\nTo enable this Beta feature in 2025.2, go to Settings | Editor | General | Code Completion | Command Completion and select Enable command completion.\nEnable Command Completion in settings (IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2)\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with command completion\nCommand completion offers you context-sensitive relevant actions. Depending on where you are in the editor, the list of suggestions may include:\nFixes for issues – quick-fixes and warnings directly from the completion popup.\nCode transformations – actions like Introduce local variable, Reformat code, or Convert to Markdown documentation comment (Java 23+), for example.\nRefactoring and navigation – commonly used actions such as Rename or Go to declaration, as well as context-specific ones like Change signature, may appear when relevant.\nCode generation – options to generate things like constructors or getters/setters, as well as toString() or test methods.\nIn frameworks, IntelliJ IDEA may also suggest relevant actions (e.g. Spring bean wiring). The feature is still evolving, and more framework- and file-type support will be added. Our goal is to provide a seamless typing experience with commands in every environment, even binaries. \nHow does command completion compare to existing features?\nIntelliJ IDEA already has multiple ways to use existing features. Let’s see how command completion compares:\nShortcuts – are great for speed, especially for frequently used actions, but learning shortcuts requires effort. This means there is a steep learning curve, and powerful features often go underused. The pool of meaningful key combinations is limited, and most shortcuts are not intuitive or memorable. Command completion is easier to use, since it does not require you to remember shortcuts; only the action you want to perform.\nIntention actions (Alt+Enter) – IntelliJ IDEA analyzes your code and highlights issues or improvements. Intention actions provide quick-fixes, but excessive highlighting can sometimes be distracting. Quick-fixes are reactive and limited to detected issues. Intention actions offer only a limited set of actions. Command completion offers you all the actions that are relevant to your current context. The list of actions is searchable, so you can find what you need.\nPostfix completion – Built-in templates let you quickly transform an existing expression with a single, meaningful suffix. For example,  .var transforms an existing expression into a properly declared variable, allowing you to keep moving forward when writing code. They require you to know about them, to know a template exists, or to be able to quickly find it. Command completion extends this idea to all actions, without requiring you to know the exact names of templates or commands.\nSearch Everywhere (⇧⇧) – This feature allows you to find anything inside IntelliJ IDEA. However, it requires multiple steps to perform an actual action: You have to open the dialog, type the name of the desired action (which requires you to know the name), navigate the results, and confirm the action; all of which pull you out of your coding flow. More importantly, it’s detached from the current code context. Command completion keeps you in the editor, in your current context, offering only actions that are relevant there.\nCode completion – In IntelliJ IDEA, code completion will automatically appear where relevant. It can also be explicitly invoked by typing a dot (.) or the shortcut (⌃␣ on macOS) / Ctrl+Space on Windows/Linux). In addition to classes, methods, and templates, command completion adds a list of context-relevant actions. You will find them in the list of regular completion. You can filter this list to commands only, using double dot (..). You can also type ”..” anywhere in your editor to see which commands are available in that context.\nCommand completion is a new and complementary way to work with IntelliJ IDEA, not a replacement for existing features. It combines the speed of shortcuts with the discoverability of Search Everywhere, in an easily accessible, context-aware experience. It helps you discover relevant, powerful features, in the context where you are working. We hope it feels like a natural extension of your existing workflow and helps you to be more productive.\nIn short: Command completion doesn’t replace existing features – it extends and complements them. \nWhy this matters\nIntelliJ IDEA is designed to keep you in the coding flow. Command completion helps with this by offering the following benefits:\nContext-awareness: Suggestions adapt to where you are in your code.\nCollaboration: Easier for experienced users to guide newcomers – just type “.change signature” – no shortcut knowledge required.\nConsistency: Works across different keymaps, OSes, and workflows.\nDiscoverability: See what actions are possible without leaving the editor.\nCommand completion allows you to think about what you want to achieve, instead of how to do so. This will also make pair programming easier, as you only need to describe what you want to do without having to interrupt your flow to find how to do it.  \nLooking ahead\nCommand completion is still in Beta in 2025.2, with improvements ongoing. At the moment, we have support for Java and Kotlin, as well as a few framework-specific actions that are also provided as intention actions, like Autowire Bean when you are using Spring Framework, or Extract JPQL Query for a Spring Data repository. \nMore actions, file types, and framework-specific commands will appear in future releases, not only for Spring, but also for Hibernate and other frameworks. For example, in the 2025.3 EAP, you can already navigate read-only files with .., Go to Declaration, or Go to Implementation – even in external libraries. Also in 2025.3 EAP, commands come with aliases, so you don’t have to remember the exact names. \nThe feature will be turned on by default in 2025.3, but there will be further improvements after that. We are also planning to add the option to add your own actions to command completion. Finally, we’re exploring integration with AI, so you could type things like “.suggest better name” or “.explain this”.\nInitial feedback\nWe very much appreciate your feedback and will be using it to guide the development process. So far, our first Beta users have indicated that the feature is promising. \nA lot of comments were provided under the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 livestream where the command completion feature was introduced:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have also received some direct feedback on LinkedIn and other Social Media: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it out: Go to Settings, enable Command Completion, type . in the editor, and explore. You might discover powerful IDE features you never knew were there!\nPlease let us know what you think. We would love to hear how you are using command completion in your daily work and what we could add to make it even better. Thank you!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At the most recent JetBrains.NET Days Online 2025 event, Maarten Balliauw delivered a comprehensive session on migrating existing codebases to use C# nullable reference types, a feature that’s been available since C# 8 but remains underutilized in many legacy projects. Through practical examples and migration strategies, Maarten demonstrated how to bring null safety to your existing code without drowning in thousands of warnings.\nWatch the full presentation\n\n\n\n\n#nullable enable – Unlock the Power of C# Nullability — Maarten Balliauw\nIt’s not for runtime safety\nMaarten opens with a crucial clarification that sets realistic expectations for the entire migration journey: “There is no runtime safety for nullable reference types. It is design time and compile time that help to check whether something can be null or not.” This isn’t a silver bullet that will eliminate all null reference exceptions – it’s a tool to help developers make better decisions while writing code.\nThe feature essentially flips the traditional C# paradigm. As Maarten explains, “The idea is that when you’re writing code, every single type that you have is going to be non-nullable by default. And there is a syntax to annotate a reference type as being nullable.” This inversion makes nullability explicit rather than implicit, forcing developers to think intentionally about null handling.\nThe Boy Scout Rule for migration\nWhen it comes to migrating existing codebases, Maarten advocates for a pragmatic approach. For smaller projects, you might enable nullability project-wide and plow through the warnings. But for larger codebases, he recommends the Boy Scout Rule: \n“Keep it disabled at the project level. And whenever you touch a piece of code, you enable it file by file and just work your way through until the entire project is converted.”\nThe key insight for where to begin? “Start at the center and work outwards” (29:59). Maarten suggests starting with classes that have few dependencies but are used extensively throughout the codebase, typically data transfer objects and domain models. A small change in these central classes can eliminate warnings across your entire codebase.\nThe temptation of the dammit operator\nThroughout the presentation, Maarten repeatedly warns against one particular anti-pattern: the null-forgiving operator (!), also known as the “dammit operator”. His stance is unequivocal: “The null forgiving operator is an anti-pattern.”\nWhy such strong language? “You’re lying to the compiler. You’re lying to yourself when you are working in this codebase a couple of months after you first wrote the code.” While the operator can be useful during migration to temporarily suppress warnings, Maarten emphasizes that production code should never ship with these suppressions.\nEmbracing null, not fighting it\nIn a refreshing perspective shift, Maarten reminds developers: “Don’t be afraid of null. Nullable reference types will help you get more confidence in compiler and IDE flow analysis. It’s impossible to get rid of all of the null usages in code” (37:23). The goal isn’t to eliminate null entirely, it’s to build a safety net for dealing with it effectively.\nThis philosophy extends to library authors, who need to consider consumers using different languages. Since nullable reference types are C# only, libraries should still include runtime null checks for robustness, especially when the API might be consumed by F# or VB.NET code that won’t benefit from the nullable annotations.\nEntity Framework’s surprise\nOne of the most valuable warnings in the presentation concerns Entity Framework Core, which has a potentially breaking behavior: “The Entity Framework Core team, unfortunately, did look at this, and they are actually updating your database schema based on nullable reference types.”\nThis means that enabling nullable reference types can inadvertently trigger database schema changes, something that might slip past developers but certainly won’t escape the notice of your DBA. It’s a “gotcha” that Maarten admits makes sense from Entity Framework’s perspective, but one that can be an unwelcome surprise during migration.\nPractical tools for the journey\nMaarten highlights several tools that make migration more manageable (38:28). The value tracking feature in Microsoft Visual Studio and Rider helps trace where properties are set, making it easier to determine if something can actually be null. The automatic migration tools can get you quite far along the way by running flow analysis and making educated guesses about nullability.\nFor JSON serialization scenarios, Maarten presents multiple strategies, with his personal favorite being the use of the required keyword combined with proper validation, rather than littering code with null-forgiving operators or losing type safety by making everything nullable.\nThe takeaway\nMaarten’s session demystifies the migration to nullable reference types, presenting it not as an all-or-nothing proposition but as a gradual improvement process. His closing summary captures the essence perfectly: “Nullable reference types give you design time and compile time safety in .NET, not at runtime.”\nThis session serves as both a technical guide and a philosophical framework for approaching nullability. It’s not about achieving perfection or eliminating all nulls – it’s about making your codebase more predictable, maintainable, and explicit about its null-handling intentions.\nFor teams sitting on legacy codebases wondering if the migration effort is worth it, the essence of Maarten’s argument is that the investment in nullable reference types pays dividends in code clarity, reduced bugs, and better communication of intent between team members, including your future self.\nFollow Maarten Balliauw’s work on nullable reference types and other C# topics on his blog, X, and Bluesky.\nWatch the full recording of this year’s online event on YouTube:\n▶️ Day 1: Aspire, Clean Architecture, C# Nullability, Messaging, Uno, Blazor TDD.\n▶️ Day 2: Event-Driven Systems & GenAI Qith Aspire, F#, dotMemory, and More.\nYou may also find these interesting:\nThe Null-Forgiving Operator in C# Is a Code Smell(!)  by Matthew Champion.\nNullable reference types in C# – Migrating to nullable reference types by Maarten Balliauw. \nNullable reference types and nullability in EF Core by Damir Arh.\nNull & Void – Everything About Nothing in .NET – a presentation given by Stefan Pölz at .NET Days Online 2021.",

저도 한때는 그랬죠. 하지만 2025년, AI 기술은 이제 우리에게 마법 같은 해결책을 제시합니다. 제가 20년 경력의 '만렙 직장인'으로서 자신 있게 말씀드리는데, 이제는 구글의 무료 AI만으로도 단 3분 만에 전문가 수준의 발표 자료를 뚝딱 만들 수 있습니다. 네, 정말 마법 같은 일이죠. 믿기 어렵다고요? 지금부터 그 비밀을 파헤쳐보겠습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">최근 제미나이와 클로드 같은 생성형 AI에 프레젠테이션 자동 생성 기능이 추가된 건 다들 아실 거예요. 주제만 입력하면 AI가 알아서 슬라이드를 만들어주니, 정말 혁신적이죠. 그런데 솔직히 말해서, 아무리 좋은 AI 기능이라도 결과물의 퀄리티는 결국 '기획력'과 '스토리라인'에 달려 있더라고요. 마치 AI에게 양질의 프롬프트가 중요하듯이 말이에요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 제가 직접 만든 것이 바로 <b>'슬라이드 빌더 AI'</b>입니다. 그리고 오늘은 여기서 한 발 더 나아가, 이 빌더 AI가 만들어낸 전략적인 슬라이드 스크립트를 실제 업무에 바로 적용할 수 있는 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환해주는 <b>'구글 슬라이드 생성기'</b> 웹앱까지 소개해드리려고 합니다. 이 두 가지 도구의 시너지로 여러분의 PPT 작업 시간을 획기적으로 줄여줄 거예요. 제가 직접 경험한 하루 걸리던 PPT 작업이 30분으로 줄어드는 기적, 여러분도 꼭 경험해 보셨으면 좋겠습니다!</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #00796b, #004d40); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  AI 프레젠테이션, 왜 '기획력'이 중요할까요?</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">많은 분들이 AI가 프레젠테이션을 만들어준다고 하면, 그저 텍스트를 입력하고 슬라이드가 짠! 하고 나오는 것을 기대하실 거예요. 하지만 제가 수많은 AI 도구를 직접 사용해보고 깨달은 건, AI는 우리가 제공하는 '방향'과 '구조'만큼만 결과물을 만들어낸다는 사실입니다. 즉, 아무리 성능 좋은 AI라도 제대로 된 슬라이드 스크립트나 명확한 스토리라인이 없으면 결과물의 퀄리티는 확 떨어질 수밖에 없어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">그래서 탄생한 것이 바로 <b>'슬라이드 빌더 AI'</b>입니다. 이 도구는 단순히 텍스트를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 여러분의 문서를 분석하여 발표 자료의 전략적인 스토리라인과 최적화된 슬라이드 구조를 JSON 형식으로 설계해줍니다. 마치 레고 블록을 조립하기 전에 완벽한 설계도를 먼저 만드는 것과 같다고 할 수 있죠. 이 과정을 통해 여러분은 AI가 만들어낼 최종 프레젠테이션의 완성도를 한 단계 끌어올릴 수 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e0f7fa; border-left: 4px solid #00796b; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>왜 JSON 형식일까요?</b><br />JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)은 제목, 소제목, 본문, 레이아웃 타입, 색상 등 슬라이드의 모든 요소를 정확하고 일관되게 구조화할 수 있는 강력한 도구입니다. 이 JSON 데이터만 있으면 어떤 프로그램으로든 정확히 똑같은 슬라이드를 재현할 수 있기 때문에, 협업이나 재활용 측면에서 매우 유리하죠. 즉, 슬라이드의 '설계도'이자 '마스터 키' 역할을 한다고 보시면 됩니다.</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #00796b, #004d40); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'의 탄생 비화</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이 혁신적인 도구들이 어떻게 탄생하게 되었는지 궁금하시죠? 사실, 이 아이디어의 시작은 일본의 '마진'님이라는 개발자분이 오픈소스로 처음 만드신 시스템에서 출발했습니다. 제미나이 AI의 '젬 지침'과 Google Apps Script를 활용한 정말 놀라운 시스템이었죠. 이후 '키무라 요시키'님께서 이를 개선하여 더 상세하고 유연한 '확장판' 형식을 만드셨습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저는 이 두 분의 훌륭한 아이디어에 더해, 제 20년 직장 생활 노하우를 접목하여 <b>'임원 보고에 특화된 C-Suite 보고 형식'</b>을 추가했습니다. 그리고 두 분이 만드신 Google Apps Script 기반의 'Google 슬라이드 생성기'를 개선하여, '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 나온 JSON 파일을 실무에 바로 활용할 수 있는 전문적인 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환해주는 웹앱으로 완성했습니다. 이 모든 과정이 여러분의 발표 준비를 획기적으로 바꿔줄 것이라 확신합니다.</p>\n<div style=\"overflow-x: auto; margin: 20px 0;\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; color: #263238;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #cfd8dc;\">\n<th style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">개발 단계</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">주요 특징</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">주요 기여자</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eceff1;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">원작 슬라이드 스크립트 생성</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">제미나이 젬 지침 &amp; Google Apps Script 기반의 혁신적 시스템</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">마진(まじん)님</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: white;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">확장판 스크립트 형식 개선</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">더 상세하고 다양한 슬라이드 패턴 지원</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">키무라 요시키(kimura_yoshiki)님</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eceff1;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">C-Suite 보고형식 추가 &amp; '슬라이드 빌더 AI' 개발</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">임원/고객 보고에 특화된 전략적 형식 및 문서 분석 기능</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">지피티팍(GPT-Park)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: white;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">'Google 슬라이드 생성기' 수정 및 웹앱화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">JSON을 실제 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환, 실무 최적화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #b0bec5;\">마진/키무라님 원작 개선 + 지피티팍 추가 수정</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">여기서 아마 이런 의문이 드실 거예요. '굳이 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능을 놔두고 왜 이 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱을 사용해야 할까?' 저는 이유가 명확하다고 봅니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">첫째, <b>압도적인 속도</b>입니다. JSON 파일만 제공되면 제미나이가 슬라이드를 만드는 데는 몇 분이 걸리지만, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 단 몇 초면 완벽한 슬라이드가 완성됩니다. 업무에서는 속도도 정말 중요하잖아요? 둘째, <b>전문성과 실용성</b>입니다. 제미나이의 결과물이 데이터의 '원본'이나 '초안' 성격이 강하다면, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 이 원본을 기반으로 브랜드 정체성을 입히고 청중의 이해도를 높이는 시각적으로 정제된 <b>'최종 비즈니스 자료'</b>에 가깝습니다. 고객사 미팅, 내부 보고, 투자 유치(IR) 등 공식적인 발표에 사용하기에는 전문성과 가독성, 그리고 브랜드 통일성을 갖춘 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'가 훨씬 더 적합하다고 제가 직접 써보니 느꼈습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">게다가 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 만든 자료에는 발표자 메모가 자동으로 추가되어 있어요. 이는 내용 전달의 정확성과 일관성을 확보해줄 뿐만 아니라, 발표자의 긴장감을 줄여주고 발표 시간 관리에도 정말 큰 도움이 됩니다. 이 정도면 업무용으로는 훨씬 강력한 도구라고 할 수 있겠죠?</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #00796b, #004d40); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>✅ 실전 가이드: '슬라이드 빌더 AI' 활용법</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">이제 이론은 충분히 이해하셨을 테니, 실제로 어떻게 이 강력한 도구들을 활용하여 프레젠테이션 자료를 만드는지 단계별로 자세히 알려드릴게요! 먼저 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'부터 시작해봅시다.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"슬라이드 빌드.png\" data-origin-width=\"1331\" data-origin-height=\"855\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bln8ry/dJMcagDPK3C/ryk5Agy7rERXGa63c27N00/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bln8ry/dJMcagDPK3C/ryk5Agy7rERXGa63c27N00/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/bln8ry/dJMcagDPK3C/ryk5Agy7rERXGa63c27N00/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2Fbln8ry%2FdJMcagDPK3C%2Fryk5Agy7rERXGa63c27N00%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"슬라이드 빌더 AI 화면 이미지\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1331\" height=\"855\" data-filename=\"슬라이드 빌드.png\" data-origin-width=\"1331\" data-origin-height=\"855\"/></span></figure>\n\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #00796b; margin: 25px 0 12px; border-bottom: 2px solid #e0f2f1; padding-bottom: 5px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>1. 스크립트 형식 선택: 나에게 맞는 스타일은?</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">'슬라이드 빌더 AI' 웹사이트에 접속하면, 가장 먼저 '슬라이드 스크립트 형식 선택'이라는 라디오 버튼들을 보실 수 있을 거예요. 여기에는 크게 세 가지 옵션이 있습니다:</p>\n<ul style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; padding-left: 25px; list-style-type: disc;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>'표준 형식'</b>: 마진(まじん)님의 원작 형식으로, 가장 범용적으로 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 팀 미팅이나 프로젝트 발표에 적합하죠.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>'확장판'</b>: 키무라 요시키(kimura_yoshiki)님이 개선한 버전입니다. 좀 더 상세하고 다양한 패턴의 슬라이드가 필요할 때 유용해요. 학술 발표나 교육 자료를 만들 때 특히 좋습니다.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 8px;\"><b>'C-Suite 보고 형식'</b>: 제가 특별히 만든 형식이에요. 마치 전략기획 전문가가 만든 것처럼 CEO나 임원진, 또는 중요한 고객 발표에 최적화된 고급 형식입니다.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e0f7fa; border-left: 4px solid #00796b; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">  <b>C-Suite 보고 형식의 강점!</b><br />이 형식은 간결하면서도 핵심을 꿰뚫는 메시지 전달에 특화되어 있어, 바쁜 임원진이나 중요한 의사결정권자에게 깊은 인상을 남기기에 정말 효과적입니다. 저는 이 형식을 만들면서 제 오랜 경험을 갈아 넣었다고 해도 과언이 아니에요!</div>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #00796b; margin: 25px 0 12px; border-bottom: 2px solid #e0f2f1; padding-bottom: 5px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>2. 발표 주제 입력 및 정보 수집</b></h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">스크립트 형식을 선택하셨다면, 이제 발표 주제를 입력할 차례입니다. 여기서는 여러분이 직접 주제를 입력하거나, 준비된 문서를 AI가 분석하게 할 수 있어요. 특히 <b>'웹 검색'</b>에 체크하면, AI가 미리 학습한 지식 기반이 아닌, 공신력 있는 최신 웹 정보를 중심으로 정보를 가져와 스크립트를 생성해줍니다. 최신 트렌드나 시의성 있는 주제를 다룰 때 아주 유용하겠죠.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #00796b; margin: 25px 0 12px; border-bottom: 2px solid #e0f2f1; padding-bottom: 5px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\"><b>3.

'글꼴'도 원하는 스타일로 선택할 수 있고, '바닥글'도 자유롭게 변경 가능합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">'꾸미기 설정'에서는 슬라이드에 포함되거나 제외될 여러 시각적 요소를 선택할 수 있고, '그라데이션 적용'은 슬라이드 내 도형의 색상에 단색이 아닌 아름다운 그라데이션을 입혀줍니다. 만약 로고를 넣고 싶다면, 업로드한 이미지 주소를 입력하여 변경할 수 있으니 참고하세요. 마지막으로 슬라이드 배경 이미지도 구글 드라이브에 등록한 이미지나 이미지 공유 사이트(예: Pexels)에서 찾은 배경 이미지 주소를 등록하면, 모든 슬라이드에 일괄 적용할 수 있습니다. 저는 Pexels에서 '배경이미지'로 검색해서 멋진 이미지를 찾았답니다!</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee; border-left: 4px solid #c62828; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">⚠️ <b>잠깐! 생성 시간에 대한 팁</b><br />모든 설정이 끝나면 '프레젠테이션 생성'을 클릭하는데요, 설정에서 그라데이션 적용이나 배경 이미지 주소를 추가하면 기본 설정보다 슬라이드 생성에 좀 더 많은 시간이 소요될 수 있습니다. 시각적 퀄리티를 높이는 만큼 약간의 시간 투자가 필요하다는 점, 염두에 두시면 좋습니다.</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #eceff1; border: 1px solid #b0bec5; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 25px; margin: 40px 0;\">\n<div style=\"font-size: 26px; color: #00796b; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-bottom: 10px; border-bottom: 2px solid #00796b;\">  핵심 요약</div>\n<ul style=\"list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;\" data-ke-list-type=\"disc\">\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px;\">✅ AI는 <b>기획력과 스토리라인</b>이 뒷받침될 때 진가를 발휘해요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px;\">✅ '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 <b>전략적인 JSON 스크립트</b>로 발표 뼈대를 탄탄하게 만들어줘요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px;\">✅ '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 생성된 JSON을 <b>몇 초 만에 실무에 최적화된 구글 슬라이드</b>로 변환해줘요.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 17px;\">✅ 'C-Suite 보고 형식'은 <b>임원/고객 보고에 특화된 전문적인 슬라이드</b>를 가능하게 해요.</li>\n</ul>\n<div style=\"margin-top: 25px; font-size: 14px; color: #607d8b; border-top: 1px dashed #b0bec5; padding-top: 15px;\">이 워크플로우를 통해 여러분의 발표 준비는 완전히 새로운 차원으로 도약할 것입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!</div>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #00796b, #004d40); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)</b></h2>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 어떤 관계인가요?</b></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">A1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 여러분의 문서를 분석하여 발표의 전략적인 스토리라인과 슬라이드 구조를 JSON 형식으로 만들어주는 도구입니다. 이렇게 생성된 JSON 스크립트를 실제로 구글 슬라이드 문서로 변환해주는 것이 바로 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱입니다. 둘은 완벽한 프레젠테이션 자동 생성 워크플로우를 위한 핵심적인 짝꿍이라고 할 수 있습니다.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>Q2: 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능 대신 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'를 사용해야 하는 특별한 이유가 있나요?</b></p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">A2: 네, 몇 가지 명확한 이유가 있습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "수십 시간 걸리던 발표 자료 준비, 이제 과거의 이야기입니다. 2025년, 구글의 무료 AI와 만렙 직장인의 노하우가 결합된 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 단 3분 만에 전문가급 프레젠테이션을 완성하는 비법을 공개합니다. 전략적인 스토리라인부터 실무에 최적화된 디자인까지, AI와 함께 빈틈없는 발표를 준비하는 새로운 워크플로우를 경험해보세요!\n⚡ 발표 준비, 아직도 수동으로 하세요? 구글 AI로 3분 컷!\n\n\n여러분, 혹시 아직도 프레젠테이션 자료 만드느라 밤샘 작업을 하고 계시나요? 저도 한때는 그랬죠. 하지만 2025년, AI 기술은 이제 우리에게 마법 같은 해결책을 제시합니다. 제가 20년 경력의 '만렙 직장인'으로서 자신 있게 말씀드리는데, 이제는 구글의 무료 AI만으로도 단 3분 만에 전문가 수준의 발표 자료를 뚝딱 만들 수 있습니다. 네, 정말 마법 같은 일이죠. 믿기 어렵다고요? 지금부터 그 비밀을 파헤쳐보겠습니다.\n최근 제미나이와 클로드 같은 생성형 AI에 프레젠테이션 자동 생성 기능이 추가된 건 다들 아실 거예요. 주제만 입력하면 AI가 알아서 슬라이드를 만들어주니, 정말 혁신적이죠. 그런데 솔직히 말해서, 아무리 좋은 AI 기능이라도 결과물의 퀄리티는 결국 '기획력'과 '스토리라인'에 달려 있더라고요. 마치 AI에게 양질의 프롬프트가 중요하듯이 말이에요.\n그래서 제가 직접 만든 것이 바로 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'입니다. 그리고 오늘은 여기서 한 발 더 나아가, 이 빌더 AI가 만들어낸 전략적인 슬라이드 스크립트를 실제 업무에 바로 적용할 수 있는 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환해주는 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱까지 소개해드리려고 합니다. 이 두 가지 도구의 시너지로 여러분의 PPT 작업 시간을 획기적으로 줄여줄 거예요. 제가 직접 경험한 하루 걸리던 PPT 작업이 30분으로 줄어드는 기적, 여러분도 꼭 경험해 보셨으면 좋겠습니다!\n  AI 프레젠테이션, 왜 '기획력'이 중요할까요?\n많은 분들이 AI가 프레젠테이션을 만들어준다고 하면, 그저 텍스트를 입력하고 슬라이드가 짠! 하고 나오는 것을 기대하실 거예요. 하지만 제가 수많은 AI 도구를 직접 사용해보고 깨달은 건, AI는 우리가 제공하는 '방향'과 '구조'만큼만 결과물을 만들어낸다는 사실입니다. 즉, 아무리 성능 좋은 AI라도 제대로 된 슬라이드 스크립트나 명확한 스토리라인이 없으면 결과물의 퀄리티는 확 떨어질 수밖에 없어요.\n그래서 탄생한 것이 바로 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'입니다. 이 도구는 단순히 텍스트를 나열하는 것을 넘어, 여러분의 문서를 분석하여 발표 자료의 전략적인 스토리라인과 최적화된 슬라이드 구조를 JSON 형식으로 설계해줍니다. 마치 레고 블록을 조립하기 전에 완벽한 설계도를 먼저 만드는 것과 같다고 할 수 있죠. 이 과정을 통해 여러분은 AI가 만들어낼 최종 프레젠테이션의 완성도를 한 단계 끌어올릴 수 있습니다.\n  왜 JSON 형식일까요?\nJSON(JavaScript Object Notation)은 제목, 소제목, 본문, 레이아웃 타입, 색상 등 슬라이드의 모든 요소를 정확하고 일관되게 구조화할 수 있는 강력한 도구입니다. 이 JSON 데이터만 있으면 어떤 프로그램으로든 정확히 똑같은 슬라이드를 재현할 수 있기 때문에, 협업이나 재활용 측면에서 매우 유리하죠. 즉, 슬라이드의 '설계도'이자 '마스터 키' 역할을 한다고 보시면 됩니다.\n  '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'의 탄생 비화\n이 혁신적인 도구들이 어떻게 탄생하게 되었는지 궁금하시죠? 사실, 이 아이디어의 시작은 일본의 '마진'님이라는 개발자분이 오픈소스로 처음 만드신 시스템에서 출발했습니다. 제미나이 AI의 '젬 지침'과 Google Apps Script를 활용한 정말 놀라운 시스템이었죠. 이후 '키무라 요시키'님께서 이를 개선하여 더 상세하고 유연한 '확장판' 형식을 만드셨습니다.\n저는 이 두 분의 훌륭한 아이디어에 더해, 제 20년 직장 생활 노하우를 접목하여 '임원 보고에 특화된 C-Suite 보고 형식'을 추가했습니다. 그리고 두 분이 만드신 Google Apps Script 기반의 'Google 슬라이드 생성기'를 개선하여, '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 나온 JSON 파일을 실무에 바로 활용할 수 있는 전문적인 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환해주는 웹앱으로 완성했습니다. 이 모든 과정이 여러분의 발표 준비를 획기적으로 바꿔줄 것이라 확신합니다.\n개발 단계\n주요 특징\n주요 기여자\n\n\n\n\n원작 슬라이드 스크립트 생성\n제미나이 젬 지침 & Google Apps Script 기반의 혁신적 시스템\n마진(まじん)님\n\n\n확장판 스크립트 형식 개선\n더 상세하고 다양한 슬라이드 패턴 지원\n키무라 요시키(kimura_yoshiki)님\n\n\nC-Suite 보고형식 추가 & '슬라이드 빌더 AI' 개발\n임원/고객 보고에 특화된 전략적 형식 및 문서 분석 기능\n지피티팍(GPT-Park)\n\n\n'Google 슬라이드 생성기' 수정 및 웹앱화\nJSON을 실제 구글 슬라이드로 자동 변환, 실무 최적화\n마진/키무라님 원작 개선 + 지피티팍 추가 수정\n\n\n\n\n여기서 아마 이런 의문이 드실 거예요. '굳이 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능을 놔두고 왜 이 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱을 사용해야 할까?' 저는 이유가 명확하다고 봅니다.\n첫째, 압도적인 속도입니다. JSON 파일만 제공되면 제미나이가 슬라이드를 만드는 데는 몇 분이 걸리지만, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 단 몇 초면 완벽한 슬라이드가 완성됩니다. 업무에서는 속도도 정말 중요하잖아요? 둘째, 전문성과 실용성입니다. 제미나이의 결과물이 데이터의 '원본'이나 '초안' 성격이 강하다면, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 이 원본을 기반으로 브랜드 정체성을 입히고 청중의 이해도를 높이는 시각적으로 정제된 '최종 비즈니스 자료'에 가깝습니다. 고객사 미팅, 내부 보고, 투자 유치(IR) 등 공식적인 발표에 사용하기에는 전문성과 가독성, 그리고 브랜드 통일성을 갖춘 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'가 훨씬 더 적합하다고 제가 직접 써보니 느꼈습니다.\n게다가 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 만든 자료에는 발표자 메모가 자동으로 추가되어 있어요. 이는 내용 전달의 정확성과 일관성을 확보해줄 뿐만 아니라, 발표자의 긴장감을 줄여주고 발표 시간 관리에도 정말 큰 도움이 됩니다. 이 정도면 업무용으로는 훨씬 강력한 도구라고 할 수 있겠죠?\n✅ 실전 가이드: '슬라이드 빌더 AI' 활용법\n이제 이론은 충분히 이해하셨을 테니, 실제로 어떻게 이 강력한 도구들을 활용하여 프레젠테이션 자료를 만드는지 단계별로 자세히 알려드릴게요! 먼저 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'부터 시작해봅시다.\n\n\n1. 스크립트 형식 선택: 나에게 맞는 스타일은?\n'슬라이드 빌더 AI' 웹사이트에 접속하면, 가장 먼저 '슬라이드 스크립트 형식 선택'이라는 라디오 버튼들을 보실 수 있을 거예요. 여기에는 크게 세 가지 옵션이 있습니다:\n'표준 형식': 마진(まじん)님의 원작 형식으로, 가장 범용적으로 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 팀 미팅이나 프로젝트 발표에 적합하죠.\n'확장판': 키무라 요시키(kimura_yoshiki)님이 개선한 버전입니다. 좀 더 상세하고 다양한 패턴의 슬라이드가 필요할 때 유용해요. 학술 발표나 교육 자료를 만들 때 특히 좋습니다.\n'C-Suite 보고 형식': 제가 특별히 만든 형식이에요. 마치 전략기획 전문가가 만든 것처럼 CEO나 임원진, 또는 중요한 고객 발표에 최적화된 고급 형식입니다.\n  C-Suite 보고 형식의 강점!\n이 형식은 간결하면서도 핵심을 꿰뚫는 메시지 전달에 특화되어 있어, 바쁜 임원진이나 중요한 의사결정권자에게 깊은 인상을 남기기에 정말 효과적입니다. 저는 이 형식을 만들면서 제 오랜 경험을 갈아 넣었다고 해도 과언이 아니에요!\n2. 발표 주제 입력 및 정보 수집\n스크립트 형식을 선택하셨다면, 이제 발표 주제를 입력할 차례입니다. 여기서는 여러분이 직접 주제를 입력하거나, 준비된 문서를 AI가 분석하게 할 수 있어요. 특히 '웹 검색'에 체크하면, AI가 미리 학습한 지식 기반이 아닌, 공신력 있는 최신 웹 정보를 중심으로 정보를 가져와 스크립트를 생성해줍니다. 최신 트렌드나 시의성 있는 주제를 다룰 때 아주 유용하겠죠.\n3. JSON 스크립트 생성 및 실시간 편집\n정보 제공이 끝나면 'AI로 구상안 만들기' 버튼을 클릭해보세요. 잠시 후, 전략적으로 구조화된 JSON 형태의 슬라이드 스크립트가 짠 하고 생성됩니다. 그런데 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'의 진정한 강점은 여기서 끝이 아니에요!\n우측 화면에는 생성된 JSON 파일의 내용을 슬라이드 별로 직접 편집할 수 있는 기능이 제공됩니다. 사용자가 수정한 내용은 왼쪽의 JSON 내용에 실시간으로 반영되며, 개별 슬라이드뿐만 아니라 전체 슬라이드에도 AI를 활용한 수정이 가능해요. 이 기능 덕분에 AI가 생성한 초안을 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 완벽하게 다듬을 수 있습니다. 제가 직접 써보니, 이 실시간 편집 기능이 정말 편리하고 효율적이었어요.\n✨ '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 완성도 높은 슬라이드 만들기\n'슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 JSON 파일을 완벽하게 다듬으셨다면, 이제 그 결과물을 실제 구글 슬라이드로 변환할 차례입니다. 최종 완성된 JSON 파일을 복사하고, 화면 맨 아래에 있는 'Google 슬라이드 생성기' 버튼을 클릭하여 해당 웹앱으로 이동하세요.\n\n\n처음 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'에 진입하면 앱스크립트 권한에 대한 보안 경고가 나타날 수 있어요. 당황하지 마시고 화면의 지시에 따라 권한을 허용해주시면 됩니다. (참고로, 이러한 권한은 앱이 여러분의 구글 드라이브에 슬라이드를 생성하기 위해 필요한 최소한의 조치이니 안심하세요!)\n이제 좀 전에 복사한 JSON 파일의 내용을 붙여넣기 하고 '프레젠테이션 생성' 버튼을 클릭하면 됩니다. 단 몇 초 후, 놀랍게도 완벽하게 디자인된 슬라이드가 생성될 거예요. '슬라이드 열기'를 클릭하면 결과물을 바로 확인할 수 있으니, 이 빠르고 효율적인 워크플로우를 직접 경험해보세요!\n추가 팁: 제미나이(Gemini)에서도 슬라이드 생성하기\n만약 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱 대신 제미나이를 통해 슬라이드를 생성하고 싶으시다면, 이 방법도 알려드릴게요. 동일하게 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 생성된 JSON을 복사한 다음, 앱 하단의 '제미나이 바로 가기' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n제미나이 채팅창에서 캔버스 기능을 활성화한 후, 복사한 JSON을 붙여넣고 맨 위에 '아래 내용을 프레젠테이션으로 생성해'라고 입력하면 됩니다. 몇 분 정도 시간이 소요되지만, 제미나이도 역시 슬라이드를 멋지게 생성해 줄 거예요. 생성이 완료된 결과물은 우측 상단의 '슬라이드로 내보내기'를 클릭하면 구글 슬라이드에서 편집할 수 있고, 거기서 PPTX나 PDF로 저장도 가능하니 참고하세요!\n  만렙 직장인의 비법: 'C-Suite 보고 형식' 활용 심화\n제가 개인적으로 가장 추천하는 기능이자, 제 20년 노하우가 집약된 'C-Suite 보고 형식'을 활용하는 방법을 좀 더 깊이 있게 다뤄볼게요. 이 기능은 정말이지 임원분들이 딱 좋아할 만한, 핵심만 콕콕 짚어주는 슬라이드를 만들어줍니다. 예를 들어, '2026년 글로벌 전기차 시장 전망 보고서'를 만든다고 가정해봅시다.\n먼저 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 'C-Suite 보고 형식'을 선택합니다. 그리고 최신 자료가 필요하므로 '웹 검색'도 꼭 선택해주세요. 그다음 발표 주제에 맞는 옵션을 선택하고, 주제인 '2026년 글로벌 전기차 시장 전망 보고서'를 입력합니다. 이어서 이번 발표의 목적을 주제에 맞게 선택하고 예상 발표 시간까지 설정해주세요. 마지막으로 주제에 맞는 목차를 선택하고 'AI로 구상안 만들기' 버튼을 클릭하면, 잠시 후 전략적인 슬라이드 스크립트가 JSON 형식으로 생성됩니다.\n스크립트가 JSON 형식으로 생성되면, 우측의 편집 메뉴에서 내용을 쉽게 수정할 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 두 번째 슬라이드 제목이 '발표 아젠다'인데, 이걸 '목차'로 변경하면 JSON 내용도 바로바로 변경되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 여러분의 의도에 맞게 스크립트를 완벽하게 다듬었다면, JSON을 복사해서 다시 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 넘어갑니다. 그리고 복사한 JSON을 바로 붙여넣기 해주세요.\n커스터마이징 옵션 상세: 나만의 슬라이드로!\n'구글 슬라이드 생성기'에서는 슬라이드에 적용할 여러 옵션을 세밀하게 설정할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, '색상' 기능으로는 실제 슬라이드에 적용되는 테마 색상을 변경할 수 있는데요. 핑크색상을 포함해서 원하는 색상을 변경하고, 나중에 다시 사용할 수 있도록 프리셋으로 저장해둘 수도 있어요. '글꼴'도 원하는 스타일로 선택할 수 있고, '바닥글'도 자유롭게 변경 가능합니다.\n'꾸미기 설정'에서는 슬라이드에 포함되거나 제외될 여러 시각적 요소를 선택할 수 있고, '그라데이션 적용'은 슬라이드 내 도형의 색상에 단색이 아닌 아름다운 그라데이션을 입혀줍니다. 만약 로고를 넣고 싶다면, 업로드한 이미지 주소를 입력하여 변경할 수 있으니 참고하세요. 마지막으로 슬라이드 배경 이미지도 구글 드라이브에 등록한 이미지나 이미지 공유 사이트(예: Pexels)에서 찾은 배경 이미지 주소를 등록하면, 모든 슬라이드에 일괄 적용할 수 있습니다. 저는 Pexels에서 '배경이미지'로 검색해서 멋진 이미지를 찾았답니다!\n⚠️ 잠깐! 생성 시간에 대한 팁\n모든 설정이 끝나면 '프레젠테이션 생성'을 클릭하는데요, 설정에서 그라데이션 적용이나 배경 이미지 주소를 추가하면 기본 설정보다 슬라이드 생성에 좀 더 많은 시간이 소요될 수 있습니다. 시각적 퀄리티를 높이는 만큼 약간의 시간 투자가 필요하다는 점, 염두에 두시면 좋습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI는 기획력과 스토리라인이 뒷받침될 때 진가를 발휘해요.\n✅ '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 전략적인 JSON 스크립트로 발표 뼈대를 탄탄하게 만들어줘요.\n✅ '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 생성된 JSON을 몇 초 만에 실무에 최적화된 구글 슬라이드로 변환해줘요.\n✅ 'C-Suite 보고 형식'은 임원/고객 보고에 특화된 전문적인 슬라이드를 가능하게 해요.\n이 워크플로우를 통해 여러분의 발표 준비는 완전히 새로운 차원으로 도약할 것입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 어떤 관계인가요?\nA1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 여러분의 문서를 분석하여 발표의 전략적인 스토리라인과 슬라이드 구조를 JSON 형식으로 만들어주는 도구입니다. 이렇게 생성된 JSON 스크립트를 실제로 구글 슬라이드 문서로 변환해주는 것이 바로 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱입니다. 둘은 완벽한 프레젠테이션 자동 생성 워크플로우를 위한 핵심적인 짝꿍이라고 할 수 있습니다.\nQ2: 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능 대신 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'를 사용해야 하는 특별한 이유가 있나요?\nA2: 네, 몇 가지 명확한 이유가 있습니다.

USB 색깔 규격이 모든 브랜드나 모든 기기에 걸쳐 아주 엄격하게 표준화되어 있는 것은 아니라는 사실이죠. 이론적으로는 어떤 제조업체가 USB 1.1 포트에 파란색을 사용할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 대부분의 잘 알려진 브랜드는 위에서 설명한 표준 색상 관례를 따르는 편이에요. 만약 확실하게 알고 싶다면, 사용하시는 기기의 설명서나 제조사 사양을 확인하는 것이 가장 정확합니다.\n이제는 스마트하게! 올바른 포트 사용 전략  \nUSB 포트 색깔이 의미하는 바를 제대로 이해하고 나니, 저의 기기 사용 습관도 완전히 바뀌었어요. 이전에는 그저 아무 데나 꽂았던 것을 이제는 각 기기에 가장 적합한 포트를 찾아 연결하기 시작한 거죠. 솔직히 말하면, 이 작은 변화가 가져온 효율성 향상에 정말 놀랐습니다.\n이제 제 스마트폰은 가능한 한 항상 빨간색이나 노란색 포트에 연결해서 충전합니다. 덕분에 배터리가 훨씬 빠르게 채워져서 더 이상 충전 때문에 애태우는 일이 없어요. 외장 하드 드라이브는 주저 없이 파란색이나 틸색 포트로 직행합니다. 덕분에 파일 백업이나 대용량 파일 전송이 예전보다 훨씬 빨라졌어요. 이전에 겪었던 긴 기다림은 이제 옛말이 되었죠. 키보드와 마우스 같은 경우는 검은색 USB 2.0 포트에도 충분히 잘 작동해서, 더 빠른 포트들은 정말 속도가 필요한 기기들을 위해 아껴둘 수 있게 되었습니다. 이렇게 전략적으로 사용하니, 괜히 느린 포트에 중요한 기기를 꽂아 시간을 낭비할 일이 없어져서 너무 좋아요!\n\n\nUSB-A 포트의 기능을 파악하는 데 색깔이 첫 번째 단서이긴 하지만, 그것이 전부는 아닙니다. 색깔 외에도 USB-A 포트에는 추가 정보를 제공하는 기호들이 종종 있어요. 예를 들어, 'SS' 또는 'SuperSpeed'라는 글자는 빠른 데이터 전송 기능을 의미하며, 때로는 'SS10'처럼 숫자가 함께 표시되어 10Gbps의 USB 3.1 Gen 2 속도를 나타내기도 합니다. 충전 전용 포트의 경우, 번개 모양이나 배터리 아이콘이 함께 표시되어 전력 출력만을 위한 포트임을 알려주기도 하니, 이런 작은 디테일에도 신경을 쓰는 것이 좋겠죠?\n이러한 USB 포트 색깔의 차이를 알게 되면서, 이제 제 기기들을 연결하는 행위는 단순한 습관이 아니라 의도적인 행동이 되었습니다. 이 지식은 단순히 PC를 사용할 때뿐만 아니라, 자동차, TV, 다른 여러 가전제품에 이르기까지 확장되어 모든 기기가 마땅히 받아야 할 최적의 전력과 속도를 누리게 해줍니다. 여러분도 오늘 알려드린 정보를 바탕으로 USB 포트를 더 스마트하게 사용하시길 바랍니다!\n  핵심 요약\n✔️ USB 포트 색깔은 기능을 나타내는 비밀 코드: 검정, 파랑, 틸, 빨강/노랑, 하양 등 각 색깔은 데이터 전송 속도와 전력 공급량을 의미합니다.\n✔️ 잘못된 포트 사용은 성능 저하를 초래: 기기 특성에 맞지 않는 포트 사용 시 충전이 느려지거나 파일 전송 시간이 길어질 수 있습니다.\n✔️ 스마트한 매칭으로 효율 극대화: 스마트폰은 고출력(빨강/노랑), 외장하드는 고속(파랑/틸), 키보드/마우스는 표준(검정) 포트에 연결하세요.\n✔️ 색깔 외 추가 표식도 확인: 'SS', 'SuperSpeed' 문구나 번개/배터리 아이콘 등도 포트의 기능을 알려주는 중요한 단서입니다.\n이 정보를 통해 여러분의 디지털 라이프가 한층 더 편리해지기를 바랍니다. 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 남겨주세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\nA1: 일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\nQ2: 제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\nA2: 빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\nQ3: USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\nA3: USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다. USB-C는 단자 모양이 동일하며, Thunderbolt 지원 여부나 USB Power Delivery (PD) 등의 추가 기능은 케이블이나 기기의 스펙을 통해 확인해야 합니다.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB 포트 색깔은 모든 기기에서 표준화되어 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"일반적으로 주요 브랜드와 최신 기기들은 색상 규격을 따르지만, 완전히 엄격하게 표준화되어 있다고 보기는 어렵습니다. 확실한 정보는 기기 매뉴얼을 확인하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"제 노트북에 빨간색 USB 포트가 없는데, 스마트폰 고속 충전은 어떻게 하나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"빨간색/노란색 포트가 없다면, 파란색(USB 3.0/3.1) 포트도 기존 검은색(USB 2.0) 포트보다 더 빠른 충전 속도를 제공합니다. 만약 더 빠른 충전을 원한다면, 고속 충전을 지원하는 외부 충전기를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"USB-C 타입 포트도 색깔로 구분할 수 있나요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"USB-C 타입은 USB-A와 달리 포트 자체의 색상으로 기능을 구분하는 경우는 거의 없습니다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 블로그를 통해 올해 내가 가장 많이 듣는 팟캐스트가 엘리트 운동선수들 인터뷰라고 했는데, 운동선수들 팟캐스트 외에 또 자주 듣는 건 전직 특수부대 출신 군인들의(미군) 팟캐스트다. 일단 미국의 엘리트 운동선수와 특수부대원의 팟캐스트를 들을 때마다 가장 놀라운 건, 말을 너무 논리적으로 잘 한다는 건데, 내가 아는 한국의 운동선수와 군인들과 비교하면 너무 차이가 난다. 물론, 말을 잘하니까 팟캐스트도 하고 사업도 하겠지만, 이건 미국의 교육과 환경의 힘이 크다고 생각한다.\n건강, 노화, 장수에 대한 전문가 중 한 명인 앤드류 후버만의 팟캐스트 Huberman Lab에서 네이비씰 군인 출신의 인플루언서이자 사업가인 DJ Shipley를 인터뷰했다. ‘How to Make Yourself Unbreakable’이라는 다소 자극적인 이름의 인터뷰이지만, 내용은 너무너무 좋다. 팟캐스트를 듣고 난 후에 나도 DJ의 습관, 루틴, 사고, 태도를 그대로 따라 해서 unbreakable이 되고 싶을 정도였다.\n일단 전 세계에서 가장 빡센 훈련을 거치는 특수부대 중의 특수부대 네이비씰 출신이라는 사실만으로 이분은 나의 존경을 받을 자격이 있다. 나는 정신력(=멘탈)과 체력(=피시컬)이 별개가 아니라 하나라고 생각하고, 정신이 몸을 지배하는 게 아니라 몸이 정신을 지배한다고 믿는 사람이라서 일단 일반인이 상상도 할 수 없는 육체적 훈련을 거치고, 그 악명높은 BUD/S(Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL) 6개월 훈련을 통과해서 네이비씰이 된 군인들을 기본적으로 존경한다. 또한, 내가 아는 대부분의 육체가 강한 사람들은 정신력도 강하기 때문에 더욱더 특수부대원들을 존경한다.\n이 팟캐스트에서 계속 언급되는 내용은 “반복” , “루틴” , “책임”이다. 특히 DJ의 루틴은 10년 이상 매일 같은 루틴을 나름 엄격하게 반복하는 나 같은 사람이 들어도 아주 짜증 날 정도로 엄격하다. 이런 사람과 같이 사는 이분의 가족이 존경스러운데, 종교보다 더 종교다운 루틴을 이분은 오랜 시간 동안 변함없이 매일 반복하고 있다. 매일 같은 시간에 기상하고, 아침마다 같은 루틴을 반복하고, 거의 같은 시간에 퇴근하고, 저녁마다 같은 루틴을 반복하고, 같은 시간에 잔다. 조금이라도 이 루틴이 어그러지면, 하루를 완전히 망치고, 하루를 망치면, 일주일을 망치고, 일주일을 망치면, 한 달이 힘들고,,,결국엔 인생이 불행해지고 정리가 안 되기 때문에, DJ의 가족은 정말 급한 위기 상황이 아니면 이 루틴을 절대로 방해하지 않는다고 한다.\n이분의 루틴은 내가 완벽하게 따라 하기엔 무리지만, 배울 점이 상당히 많다고 생각했다. 네이비씰이 전시에 지키는 그 엄격한 루틴을 제대한 후에도 인생에 그대로 적용하고 있고, 이런 삶을 살면 남들보다 더 앞설 수 있다는 건 누구가 잘 알지만, 또 동시에 이런 삶을 모두가 다 살 수 없다는 것도 잘 알고 있다. 그런데 이런 루틴은 이분의 삶의 극히 일부만 반영하고, 실제 배울 점은 이런 루틴을 기반으로 자신을 unbreakable 하게 만들 수 있는 습관, 태도, 사고방식인데, 이런 것들이 이 팟캐스트의 핵심이다.\n인터뷰에서 DJ가 “내가 어떤 사람이 될 진, 그 누구도 아닌, 바로 내가 결정한다.”라는 너무나 당연한 말을 했는데, 나는 이 말이 제일 맘에 들었고 이거 하나만 제대로 해도 성공적인 인생을 살 수 있다고 믿는다. 그리고 다음과 같은 거창하지 않은, 평범한 예시를 들었다. 우리 주변에 항상 있는데, 매일 아침 늦게 일어나서 허둥지둥 회사에 미친 듯이 뛰어오고, 이 와중에 지하철에서 지갑이나 폰을 분실하고, 일에 집중 못 해서 매일 깨지는,,,그런 사람들이 있다. 이들은 스스로에게 “왜 내 인생은 항상 이럴까?” , “왜 나는 항상 여유가 없을까?”라면서 자책한다.\n근데 정말 왜 그럴까? 이런 사람들은 왜 항상 이렇게 살까? 간단하다. 본인이 인생을 그렇게 만들었기 때문이다. 그리고 계속 이러면 평생 지각하고 평생 여유 없는 인생을 살 것이다. 본인이 스스로 이런 사람이 되는 결정을 했기 때문이다. 자신을 진지하게 대하고, 스스로의 선택과 행동에 책임을 져야 한다. 그리고, 이건 네이비씰이 아니라도 누구나 다 할 수 있다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 글은 이미 폴 그레이엄이 ‘Do Things that Don’t Scale’에서 제품을 만들 때 처음부터 스케일을 생각하지 말고, 한 땀 한 땀 노가다로 시작하라고 강조한 내용을 거의 재탕하는 포스팅이다. 이제 필수 고전이 된 이 글은 대부분의 창업가가 읽어 봤을 텐데, 제품과 사업의 초기 실적을 만들기 위해서는 노동집약적인 노가다를 하면서 초기 고객들과 충분한 대화를 하고 이들이 원하는 걸 정확히 파악하는 게 중요하다는 내용이다. 에어비앤비 창업가들이 사업 초기에 직접 집주인들을 찾아가서 본인들이 사진을 이쁘게 찍어서 공급을 확보하거나, 드롭박스 대표가 지인들의 컴퓨터에 소프트웨어를 직접 설치해 주고 사용 방법을 알려줬던 초기 노가다는 이젠 전설이 되긴 했지만, 이런 unscalable한 행동들이 미래의 scalable한 프로세스의 기반이 된다는 내용의 글이다.\n내가 VC를 시작할 때 이 글을 처음 읽었을 땐 잘 이해하지 못했다. 내가 뮤직쉐이크를 할 때 투자받기 위해서 VC들을 만나면 모두다 “이 사업을 어떻게 체계적으로 확장할래?”라는 질문을 했고, 나는 이들을 만족시킬 수 있는 답이 없었기 때문에 – 당시엔 모든 걸 수동적으로 하나씩하고 있었다 – 매번 깨졌다. 그래서 어떻게 하면 처음부터 제이 커브의 스케일을 만들 수 있을지 계속 고민했는데, 폴 그레이엄은 오히려 완전히 반대의 내용을 이 글을 통해서 말하고 있었기 때문이다.\n하지만, 나도 많은 회사에 투자하면서 이들이 어떻게 제품을 만들고 초기 고객을 확보하면서 성장하는지를 옆에서 보니, 스케일이 안 되는 노가다를 먼저 하라는 말이 정확하게 이해됐고, 이제 나도 우리 투자사 대표님들에게 거의 비슷한 내용을 설교한다.\nB2C든 B2B든 제품을 만들 때 가장 먼저 해야 하는 건 product market fitting이다. 우리가 만들고 싶은 제품을 시장이 원하는 제품과 최대한 일치시키는 작업인데, 이걸 하기 위한 지름길은 없다. 가장 좋은 방법은 잠재 고객과 이야기하면서 이들의 목소리를 듣는 건데, 고객의 목소리를 가장 자세히 듣는 방법은 한 번에 한 명의 고객과 이야기하는 것이다. 초기 product market fitting을 위해서 한 번에 백만 명의 고객과 이야기할 순 없다. 한 번에 여러명의 고객과 이야기하는 건 product market fit가 된 제품이 어느 정도 만들어진 후 더 많은 고객이 원하는 기능을 개발할 땐 가능하지만, 일단 그 제품을 만들기 위해선 고객을 한 명씩 찾아가서 이들을 이해하고, 이들의 목소리를 듣고, 그리고 우리 제품을 직접 보여줘야 한다.\n소상공인을 위한 B2B 솔루션을 만들고 싶다면 매일 소상공인을 찾아가서 이들과 직접 이야기해야 한다. 이렇게 고객의 목소리를 하나씩 듣고 그들이 필요한 걸 코드로 만들어야 한다. 스타벅스보다 더 좋은 커피 비즈니스를 만들고 싶다면 매일 스타벅스 매장에 가서 스타벅스 고객들과 직접 이야기해야 한다. 이렇게 고객의 목소리를 하나씩 듣고 그들이 필요한 걸 스타벅스보다 더 잘 만들어야 한다. 이런 스케일이 안 되는 노가다를 해야지만 스케일을 위한 기본적인 프로세스를 구축할 수 있다. \n창업가들은 초반부터 스케일을 만들기 위해서 너무 초조해하지 말고, 노가다를 리스펙트하는 법을 배워야 한다.",
