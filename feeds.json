        "content:encodedSnippet": "ExecuTorch is the PyTorch inference framework for edge devices developed by Meta with support from industry leaders like Arm, Apple, and Qualcomm. \nRunning machine learning (ML) models on-device is increasingly important for Meta’s family of apps (FoA). These on-device models improve latency, maintain user privacy by keeping data on users’ devices, and enable offline functionality.\nWe’re showcasing some of the on-device AI features, powered by ExecuTorch, that are serving billions of people on Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook.\nThese rollouts have significantly improved the performance and efficiency of on-device ML models in Meta’s FoA and eased the research to production path.\nOver the past year, we’ve rolled out ExecuTorch, an open-source solution for on-device inference on mobile and edge devices, across our family of apps (FoA) and seen significant improvements in model performance, privacy enhancement, and latency over our previous on-device machine learning (ML) stack.\nExecuTorch was built in collaboration with industry leaders and uses PyTorch 2.x technologies to convert models into a stable and compact representation for efficient on-device deployment. Its compact runtime, modularity, and extensibility make it easy for developers to choose and customize components – ensuring portability across platforms, compatibility with PyTorch, and high performance.\nAdopting ExecuTorch has helped us enhance our user experiences in our products and services used by billions of people all over the world.\nThe following are just a few examples of the various ML models on our apps on Android and iOS devices that ExecuTorch supports.\nEnabling Cutouts on Instagram\nCutouts is one of Instagram’s latest features for creative expression and storytelling. It lets people transform photos and videos of their favorite moments into animated, personalized stickers that they can share via Reels or Stories. We migrated the Cutouts feature in Instagram to run with ExecuTorch by enabling SqueezeSAM, a lightweight version of the Meta Segment Anything Model (SAM). For both Android and iOS, ExecuTorch was significantly faster compared to the older stack, translating into increases in Cutouts’ daily active users (DAU). \nExecuTorch enables Instagram’s Cutouts feature to run faster and more efficiently for both on-device sticker generation (left) and creating overlays on a photo. (right)\nImproving video and call quality on WhatsApp\nWhatsApp needs to be usable and reliable regardless of your network connection bandwidth. To achieve this, we developed bandwidth estimation models, tailored for various platforms. These models help detect and utilize available network bandwidth, optimizing video streaming quality without compromising the smoothness of video calls.  \nThese models need to be highly accurate and run as efficiently as possible. By leveraging ExecuTorch, we have observed improvements for the bandwidth estimation models in performance, reliability, and efficiency metrics. Specifically, we reduced the model load time and average inference time substantially while reducing app not responsive (ANR) metrics. Along the way, we further strengthened  security guarantees compared to the older PyTorch mobile framework by adding fuzzing tests, which involve supplying invalid or random inputs to a program and monitoring for exceptions. With the positive signal from these releases, we are now migrating several other key WhatsApp models, such as ones for on-device noise-canceling and video enhancement, to ExecuTorch as well. \nHere, Messenger’s language identification model (Lid) restricts the prompt language to English for Meta AI’s Imagine feature.\nShipping on-device ML for end-to-end encryption on Messenger\nEnd-to-end encryption (E2EE) on Messenger ensures that no one except you and the people you’re talking to can see your messages, not even Meta. ExecuTorch has enabled E2EE on Messenger by moving server side models to run on-device, allowing data transfers to remain encrypted.\nTo enable E2EE, we migrated and deployed several models, including an on-device language identification (LID) model on Messenger. LID is a Messenger model that detects the language of given text and enables various downstream tasks, including translation, message summarization, and personalized content recommendations. With ExecuTorch, on-device LID is significantly faster and conserves server and network capacity. \nTo preserve Messenger’s E2EE environment, we have also leveraged ExecuTorch to move other Messenger models on-device, including one for optimizing video calling quality (similar to WhatsApp’s bandwidth estimation models) and another for image cutouts (similar to Cutouts on Instagram). These shifts resulted in improved infrastructure efficiency by freeing up capacity and enabling us to scale these features globally. \nBackground music recommendations for Facebook\nFacebook employs a core AI model called SceneX that performs a variety of tasks, including image recognition/categorization, captioning, creating AI-generated backgrounds for images, and image safety checks. Shifting SceneX to ExecuTorch now allows it to enhance people’s Facebook Stories by suggesting background music based on images.\nWith the ExecuTorch rollout, we saw performance improvements in SceneX across the board from low- to high-end devices compared to the older stack. Several other models, including which enhance image quality and perform background noise reduction during calls, are now in various stages of A/B testing. \nBuilding the future of on-device AI with the ExecuTorch Community\nWe hope the results we’ve seen leveraging ExecuTorch to help solve some of Meta’s on-device ML challenges at scale will be encouraging to the rest of the industry. We invite you to contribute to ExecuTorch and share feedback on our GitHub page. You can also join our growing community on the ExecuTorch Discord server.\nWe look forward to driving more innovation in on-device ML and shaping the future of on-device AI together with the community.\nThe post Accelerating on-device ML on Meta’s family of apps with ExecuTorch appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Meta has developed Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) and Policy Zones to enforce purpose limitations on data, especially in large-scale batch processing systems. \nPolicy Zones integrates with Meta’s exabyte-scale data warehouse and processing systems, using runtime enforcement and SQL parsing to propagate and enforce privacy annotations across millions of daily data flows per day, performing trillions of user consent checks per hour, and through our stream processing systems which transport multiple petabytes per hour.\nWe’ve built tools to help engineers use Policy Zones, so that they can quickly respond to privacy requirements. As a testament to its usability, these tools have allowed us to deploy Policy Zones  across data assets and processors in our batch processing systems. \nPolicy Zones technology is used at scale in batch processing systems to meet our privacy commitments to our users across Meta’s family of apps. While Policy Zones technology has become widely used in our batch processing systems, we are continuing to invest in PAI to make it even easier to use for our engineers. \nMeta’s Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) is designed to streamline data flows while ensuring purpose limitation and transparency, leveraging automation to reduce the overhead associated with privacy requirements. This enables our engineers to focus on building innovative products that people love, while always honoring their privacy. By making privacy a core part of our infrastructure, we’re empowering product teams to create new experiences that delight our community.\nIn our previous blogs, we introduced PAI and its key components, including data lineage and data understanding. These foundational elements have enabled us to effectively manage and track data flows at scale. As we moved forward to enforce purpose limitation, we recognized the need for a robust solution to control how data flows in complex systems, and remediate data flow at scale so that engineers can focus on production innovation with limited friction arising from privacy compliance. \nIn this blog, we will deep dive into our Policy Zones approach for batch processing systems and how we use it to protect users’ messaging data. These systems process data in batch (mainly via SQL), such as our exabyte data warehouse that powers Meta’s AI training and analytics workflows. \nBefore Policy Zones, we relied on conventional access control mechanisms like access control lists (ACL) to protect datasets (“assets”) when they were accessed. However, this approach requires physical coarse-grained separation of data into distinct groupings of datasets to ensure each maintains a single purpose. While viable at a small scale, this approach leads to significant operational overhead as it requires frequent and exhaustive audits of many individual assets to ensure the continuous validity for a sizable privacy control.\nData flow control for batch processing systems via Policy Zones\nTo mitigate the challenges associated with coarse-grained physical data separation, we have invested in Policy Zones as a key component of our PAI strategy. It leverages Information Flow Control (IFC) principles to offer a more durable and sustainable approach by controlling not only how data is accessed but also how data is processed and transferred in real time. We developed tools and APIs for developers to easily integrate Policy Zones, which automatically track and protect data flows by enforcing flow restrictions at runtime, to their code. To maintain data integrity, Policy Zones enforce a fundamental principle: The restrictions on downstream data must be equal to or more restrictive than those of the upstream source from which the data originates. Once the data is protected by Policy Zones, any future processing or usage of the data has to be compatible with the restrictions or it will be blocked.\nMeta’s data warehouse is a critical component of our data processing infrastructure, supporting various workloads such as batch analytics, real-time processing, and machine learning. Engineers have developed numerous data processing systems to cater to different usage patterns, resulting in millions of jobs running daily to process and transform data. Policy Zones operates at tremendous scale, including:\nControlling access for millions of datasets,\nAnalyzing the processing of tens of millions of data flows per day across hundreds of thousands of unique queries,\nPerforming batch user consent checks that performs trillions of consent checks per hour across datasets that span different purpose-use boundaries,\nHandling hundreds of distinct data policy requirements for any given flow.\nThe intricate relationships between datasets are exemplified in the following diagram, which depicts a single deployment of Policy Zones enforcing a purpose-use limitation on a subset of data processing within the warehouse. This visual representation highlights the complexity of data dependencies and the need for robust policy enforcement mechanisms. Each dot represents a single dataset, and each line between them represents a data dependency. In other words, in order to compute a given dataset (represented by dots), you would need to use all of the datasets that are connected to it (represented by lines). \n\nAt first glance, the intricate web of data dependencies may seem daunting to manage. However, Policy Zones is designed to track and enforce policies across these complex relationships. While compartmentalizing such a complex system can be resource intensive, Policy Zones offers a more efficient and effective solution for managing data dependencies and ensuring privacy requirements. To address the challenges we’ve faced over the years, we’ve had to develop innovative solutions for our batch processing systems, which are essential for managing the vast amounts of data that flow through our systems. The table below describes the key challenges and our approaches to solving them.\nChallenge\nApproach\n\n\nCoarse-grained data separation to compartmentalize purpose use: A common strategy for managing distinct purposes is to separate data and its processing entirely, a technique known as data compartmentalization. However, this approach can be difficult to implement due to the intricate web of data dependencies that exist within our systems.\nFine-grained information flow tracking: We track how data flows to ensure that the restrictions are at least as restrictive as the sources used to populate the output datasets. As a result, engineers do not need to coarsely compartmentalize their data. Fine-grained tracking allows us to more efficiently profile risk without needing to separate data and its processing to specific purposes.\n\n\nOverly conservative labeling of data (label creep): By default, any incidental access of purpose-use limited  data results in all of the derived datasets needing to be purpose-use limited, even if the access is spurious. We need a way to stop propagation (called reclassification) of sensitive data labels when the data is transformed to no longer be sensitive.\nPolicy Zone Manager (PZM): We built a suite of tools that aids in carefully propagating purpose-use limitations that will identify potential over-labeling situations; these are controlled through a reclassification system, which allow engineers to safely stop propagation. \n\n\nLack of governance, extensible data model: There are numerous internal data policies and individual privacy controls active at any given time, with new policies being created regularly by various public commitment-oriented teams. These teams need to have strong controls over how their data policies are being enforced. It’s also critical that each policy operates independently from other policies due to the different stages of rollout each policy is in.\nGovernable Data Annotations (GDAs) are precise, governed annotations on datasets that describe the kinds of data that are subject to purpose-use limitations. Their entire lifecycle is subject to precise controls; they limit who can create them, who can associate the annotation on a dataset, who can remove an annotation, among other controls. The annotation labels are human readable, e.g., MESSAGING_DATA  describes user data from a messaging context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll walk through how we protect user’s messaging data with Policy Zones across our batch processing systems. Users send messages to others through apps like Facebook Messenger. Messenger supports end-to-end encryption. Additionally, to support platform integrity and reliability, we process certain non-content messaging data, such as delivery timestamps and status, to support product performance improvement, detect abuse, and protect users from harmful conduct.\nMessaging data is collected from these apps and enters into our data warehouse and AI systems via logging or database scrapes from web systems. It is streamed through our message queue, Scribe, where it can be processed in real time or stored in a time-partitioned dataset for asynchronous batch processing.\n\nThe logging libraries are configured in a fluent builder pattern. Below is a snippet that shows how a logger  is configured to log messaging metadata. The key element is that the logger is associated with a Policy Zones annotation; in this blog post we call it MESSAGING_DATA. This annotation is called a Governable data annotation (GDA). GDAs are simple, human-readable labels that affect the behavior of access on the dataset. GDAs have controls on their lifecycle that ensure data policies are upheld. In the representative code snippet below, the annotation on the logger will restrict where the data can flow, in particular it can only flow to other datasets that have this annotation, and further that access to it is restricted to allowed purposes defined in a separate central configuration.\n\nThe above annotation on the logger will trigger Policy Zones’ infrastructure to impose certain restrictions. One key requirement is that downstream data assets, which rely on this logger’s data, must also carry the same annotation. This is done by leveraging Policy Zone’s flow control mechanisms that reason about how data flows through our systems. A processor can access a dataset annotated with a GDA if the Policy Zones infrastructure has checked the flow of data. \nThe logger config code snippet above generates code that writes data to a corresponding Scribe message queue category from our web servers. Policy Zones verifies that the messaging GDA is associated with this downstream Scribe category, ensuring compliant data flow (see the corresponding flow below).\n\nScribe category data is processed by our stream processing systems and ingested into the warehouse in the form of time-partitioned datasets. These time-partitioned datasets are used by our batch processing to compute derived datasets to product support analytics, machine learning, and operational monitoring, among other uses. \nEnforcing zones as data flows through the warehouse\nIn the next section, we’ll explore how Policy Zones enforces purpose-use limitation in the warehouse. Data processing within the data warehouse is typically represented using SQL, which defines how to store, transform, and retrieve relational data. SQL’s declarative nature and robust support for relational data processing enables users to write large-scale data processing jobs that can handle petabytes of data with minimal code. These attributes significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of privacy-related tasks, allowing for scalable, policy-compliant data processing across our infrastructure. The most popular warehouse processors, like Presto, are SQL-based. \nScheduling these queries is done through our distributed job scheduling framework, Dataswarm. Users specify the frequency of runs and what data they depend on. Since our data is primarily time-partitioned, job schedules mirror the partitioning scheme of the data starting in a waiting state, and then run as soon as new time partitions become available. An example representative dataswarm pipeline is shown below, that calculates daily messages sent. It does this by reading a representative example of an input messages metadata logger dataset (described above), transforming that data and then writing it into an output messages_sent table.\n\nThe example query in the Dataswarm pipeline above illustrates how to compute a derived dataset, calculating the daily number of messages sent per user. This concise, templatized SQL statement is processed by Dataswarm, which generates a fully expanded SQL statement that Presto then interprets to initiate a distributed job across thousands of machines. By abstracting away the execution details, engineers can focus on defining high-level transformations, simplifying the development process and improving productivity.\n\nWe built Unified Programming Model (UPM), a SQL parser that intercepts queries issued by various data processors and translates them into semantic trees. These trees capture the inputs, outputs, and transformations of each data movement step, providing the necessary signals for precise policy enforcement as data flows through the system.\nAs shown in the diagram below, the process begins with data processors issuing SQL queries. UPM parses those queries and sends the information about the transformation to the first key piece of Policy Zones infrastructure: the Policy Evaluation Service (PES). PES performs flow control checks, validating whether the data movement and transformation steps comply with privacy policies. The diagram below shows how Policy Zones integrates with the existing batch processing infrastructure.\n\nIf a flow is allowed, PES passes the decisions to the compute engines, which then perform the actual low-level data accesses. PES also forwards the checking results to the Warehouse Permission Service (WPS), which performs a final validation, ensuring that access to warehouse data is reasoned about in a policy-aware manner. WPS was built to service traditional access control. We have since augmented its abilities to also ensure safe flows according to the GDAs annotated on the accessed datasets. It does this through propagation of a special token (depicted above with a key icon). PES issues the key to the client, which contains cryptographically signed contextual information. That key is then forwarded through the compute engines and passed in at time of access. This allows WPS to have enough context to reason about the access in the greater context of the overall flow. To illustrate this change, let’s look at how WPS has changed with the integration of Policy Zones. Historically, WPS only received individual access requests (e.g., “read table A by identity X,” or separately, “write table B by identity Y”). With our Policy Zones integration, WPS can now see additional information such as, “read table A by identity X and PES says the read satisfies the GDA flow safety requirements on the MESSAGING_DATA GDA.” \nProcessors integrate against Policy Zones through a client-side library we refer to as PrivacyLib. PrivacyLib abstracts the coordination logic, operational monitoring, and service calls in an effort to separate concerns between data processing business logic and privacy checking. \nStream processing. Up until this point, we’ve described how data flows from web server frontends to time-partitioned datasets in the warehouse via an ingestion system that reads from Scribe categories. However, there are also real-time stream processing systems that directly operate against the Scribe categories, rather than working on the bulk time-partitioned datasets. These systems are often used in latency-sensitive systems where we need to compute results quickly from large datasets (e.g., categorizing newly created users originating from a spam bot based on their recent events to detect terms of service violations). \nPolicy Zones are also integrated into these systems in much the same way. XStream is our next-generation stream processing system that provides a SQL-like interface for defining streaming data transformations. We use the same UPM parse to determine safe data flows. Key to scaling and reliability is that we analyze the streaming application statically before it starts processing events. This is made possible by XStream’s declarative data transformation programming model. Other realtime processing systems are handled by Policy Zones for function-based systems, which was alluded to in our earlier blog post about Policy Zones.\nThe critical component in allowing fine-grained data separation is the Flows-To evaluator in PES. After the source-sink data dependency information is extracted, PES determines if the flow of data is permissible by using information-flow control-theoretic checks. Some of these checks can include ensuring a consent check was performed by the data processor (e.g., to ensure the user permits their data to be used for a certain purpose), or that the GDA from the source tables are also on the destination table. These checks can be modeled as a lattice where the nodes represent different GDA labeling states and purpose use, and the edges between them represent allowed (safe) transitions. The code snippet below shows the logic of one of the functions that performs our purpose-use checks for GDAs, written in Rust, with some modifications made for clarity.\nCode snippet: One of PES’s core functions for checking that the purpose of access is allowed by the GDA, checked by our lattice-theoretic Flows-To checker. The function first collects all of the purpose limitations from all of the source datasets being accessed. It then loops through each GDA’s requirements to see if the allowed purposes of the GDA satisfies our flows-to checker on the intended consumption purpose. If not, the flow is marked as unsafe.\nPutting the pieces together, PES and WPS integrate into our batch processing systems to allow seamless flow safety checks against our purpose-use limitation requirements. Instead of traditional coarse-grained data separation, engineers can write batch processing queries that access datasets with heterogeneous purpose-use requirements all in the same warehouse. People do not necessarily need to request permission to special purpose-use limited silos of the warehouse as Policy Zones can ensure the data is protected despite being commingled with other non-purpose-use restricted datasets. This unique ability is particularly useful for machine learning workflows, which we discuss in the next section.\nEnforcing zones for AI training workflows\nNon-content messaging data is used to train models, such as spam filters, to identify and block unwanted or malicious messages, ensuring a safe user experience. PES is integrated directly into the APIs used by workflows for reading and writing data and models, enforcing strong data usage protections. Below is a main scenario detailing data flow in the ML stack. The diagram below shows the component architecture of AI training at Meta, and how Policy Zones integrates with it. Key to our architecture is that PES integrates principally at the control plane of AI training. To build intuition from the previous general purpose warehouse processing section, this is analogous to checking SQL statements rather than checking individual rows being accessed.\n\n\nMachine learning training workflows are defined by user-authored scripts, which can be created using internal authoring tools, all of which utilize Python. Users also have the option to directly write custom Python code to interact with workflow scheduling tools like FBLearner. During the training process, large-scale dataframes are loaded into the training workflow. These dataframes can be sourced from Data Warehouse or directly from real-time batch services.\nIn scenarios involving distributed training, intermediate storage like temporary tables are used to temporarily store data outputs between operators. The resulting models are stored in the model storage system. For tasks such as transfer learning or recurring/continuous training, these models can be retrieved from the model storage and reintroduced into the training workflow for incremental updates.\nWorkflows can be annotated with purpose-use requirements in the following ways.\nAutomatic inference: PES automatically infers annotations from upstream data dependencies and applies them to the current workflow and all downstream dependent models or assets, provided there are no conflicts. \nManual override: Users can manually override the inferred annotations when authoring workflows or in the model type linked to the workflows. The “Model Type” is a widely used concept at Meta to describe the clearly delineated business purpose for the machine learning work.\nBelow is a representative code example defining a training workflow:\n\nWe associate model types with a GDA. The following shows the configuration information for the messaging_spam_filter model type; note that it is annotated with the MESSAGING_DATA GDA.\n\nAt run time, we associate all accesses during the workflow with a model type and ensure that the assets being written to also have GDA. PES is integrated into various data reading and writing APIs within the AI training stack to accommodate this capability. When a workflow reads data, it retrieves the data’s annotations. The first annotation is applied to the workflow. When the workflow outputs data, the data output is annotated with the current workflow’s annotation, including any intermediate datasets.\nHow Policy Zones are applied reliably at scale\nPolicy Zones Manager (PZM) enables engineers to reliably integrate Policy Zones to existing data processing and propagate them to new processing code. PZM supports two major workflows: applying zones to existing processing, and propagating zones from new processing. Although many components are shared between these two workflows, the overall experience is quite different for engineers.\nApplying zones to existing processing. PZM allows engineers to seed a proposed annotation on a dataset (e.g., the logger from the beginning of the blog post) to understand the downstream implications. Since Policy Zones is an enforcement mechanism, care must be taken in applying GDAs as it may break production workflows. PZM will guide an engineer trying to add a GDA through the right steps to avoid any production breakage. It does this by simulating the potential effects of enforcement that comes from the new GDA labeling, and then suspending flows that would break. These suspensions are then tracked and burned down by the engineer to ensure complete end-to-end compliance with the GDA’s purpose-use requirements.\nPropagating Zones from new processing. As engineers build new processing pipelines, PZM validates the new flows and surfaces any issues detected with the data flow. As data flows through our warehouse, we need to ensure derived datasets continue to be properly annotated. When a user tries to derive new datasets from Policy Zones-protected data, the system may automatically repair the flow (e.g., by propagating the annotation when the intention is clear from context), or if the context is unclear, will present an interstitial to the user. Dr Policy Zone (Dr. PZ) is a debugger tool that guides an engineer to resolve these kinds of Policy Zones errors.  \nTo illustrate how Dr. PZ works, recall above the example SQL statement that computes message sends for each user.  The SQL read from the message_metadata table and wrote to the messages_sent table. If the output table does not have the right set of GDAs, the user will be presented with an error message and ways to fix their in-development pipeline. We use generative AI to simplify the explanation to the user and also to provide some remediation guidance. The screenshot below shows an example of a dialog an engineer would interact with in Dr. PZ. \nReclassification is critical to limiting over-annotation from spurious flows. In our messaging example, reclassification allows us to stop propagating the MESSAGING_DATA  GDA on an output table even if the source table may have it. Reclassifications are governed by a precise set of rules that ensure the high-level data policies are not broken. In general, reclassifications are controlled by separate safeguards independent from Policy Zones. Allowed reclassifications are specific to each GDA and may include: different privacy systems Policy Zones is not natively aware of, complex privacy-preserving transformations (e.g., differential private mechanisms), or through routine review by human subject matter experts. \nLearnings and challenges\nIn our blog post that introduced Policy Zones, we discussed some of the high level learnings and challenges of scaling out Policy Zones. In this section, we focus on the learnings and challenges from scaling Policy Zones for batch processing.\nOpaque operators. Not all processing  in the warehouse is SQL-based. An example would be small-scale intermediate processing in a general purpose programming language: Dataswarm supports PhpMethodOperator, which allows one to write arbitrary Hack code transformations on (small) warehouse datasets. For these cases, we built processor-specific integration points to capture the context of the data flow. PrivacyLib makes integrations relatively straightforward. The major challenge we had to overcome was finding the right place to integrate Policy Zones checking. We targeted low-level data access call sites as PrivacyLib can help stitch together data dependency information (e.g., by logging reads to correlate against future writes by a data processor). \nReclassification versus complex data policies. Our original instantiation of policy rules was quite expressive. It allowed the formulation of intricate data flow policies. An advantage of this approach is that we did not need to use reclassification as the policy captured most of the subtle intricacies. The major disadvantage of this approach was that it was very difficult for engineers to understand and debug blocked flows. We decided to simplify our policy language to a nominal typing system of flat, hierarchy-free human-readable labels. Safe transitions could only be described through transitions from one set of GDAs to another set. We found that nuances in a data policy were better tracked by our reclassification system so engineers could generally have a simple model of the policy that worked for most data processing. \nThe future of Policy Zones for batch processing\nPolicy Zones enables developers to quickly innovate in our data warehouse while respecting the various privacy requirements on the data they are using. Policy Zones has hit major milestones in the warehouse, but we still have exciting opportunities ahead of us. These include:\nReducing friction through generative AI: Navigating Policy Zones errors can be quite tricky at times. We’ve built an expert system in Dr. PZ that attempts to help engineers navigate the right remediation plan. In addition to this deterministic system, we are also experimenting with using generative AI to help a user navigate the right path and better understand why they are being blocked.\nClosing the gap on opaque operators: as mentioned in the previous section, we’ve had challenges in tracking the data dependencies in some of our processing. For the time being, we’ve resorted to traditional coarse-grained data separation and siloing processing. However, we are continuing to close this gap through improved PrivacyLib integrations to further reduce friction for engineers so they can enjoy the benefits of fine-grained data tracking.\nSeamless hand-off to Policy Zones for function-based systems: in our original blog post we described two versions of Policy Zones. This post focuses on the first, Policy Zones for batch processing systems.  A future post will focus on the second, Policy Zones for function-based systems. \nIn day-to-day usage, the end-to-end flow of data and processing touches on both of these systems. Today, we have a process to ensure that the requirements from one Policy Zones system are eventually mirrored in the other as data moves between the two. We hope to make this experience more seamless so that engineers don’t have to think about two separate runtimes.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees who have played a crucial role in developing purpose limitation for batch processing systems over the years.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Hardware faults can have a significant impact on AI training and inference.\nSilent data corruptions (SDCs), undetected data errors caused by hardware, can be particularly harmful for AI systems that rely on accurate data for training as well as providing useful outputs.\nWe are sharing methodologies we deploy at various scales for detecting SDC across our AI and non-AI infrastructure to help ensure the reliability of AI training and inference workloads across Meta.\n\nMeta’s global AI infrastructure consists of a large number of hardware components and servers , connected via network fabric across globally distributed data centers. This setup integrates storage, compute, and network architectures with unique file systems and PyTorch applications tailored for training or inference workloads. This infrastructure supports training large-scale models as well as advanced AI applications such as text-to-image generation and object segmentation.  \nSince 2018, Meta’s hardware reliability journey has led to novel findings, identifying unique failure types in disks, CPUs, memories, switches, GPUs, ASICs, and networks, often leading the industry in discovering failure modes. We have developed mitigation policies to ensure smooth infrastructure operation and availability for billions of users and thousands of internal use cases. As we continue to build large AI clusters, understanding hardware failures and mitigation strategies is crucial for the reliable training of large-scale AI models.\nTraining large-scale models involves thousands of accelerators in a synchronous environment, where any component failure can interrupt or halt the process. We focus on reducing hardware failures during training through detection and diagnostics, and quickly restarting training with healthy servers and accelerators. This involves optimizing fault categorization, device triage, node selection, cluster validation, and checkpoint restore.\nFrom our experience running the Llama 3 herd of models, we find that hardware failures in components such as SRAMs, HBMs, processing grids, and network switch hardware significantly impact AI cluster reliability, with over 66% of training interruptions due to such failures. Some of the challenges for AI clusters include accelerators that might be less reliable than CPUs due to complexity and limited telemetry, network complexity that could result in misattributed failures, and errors within the GPU software stack that may require  extensive configuration to correct. Hence, reducing hardware and configuration failures greatly enhances cluster efficiency.\n\nTypes of hardware faults encountered at Meta\nThe hardware faults or errors that we observe in our infrastructure can be classified broadly into three categories: \nStatic errors \nHardware failures often appear as binary states: A device either powers on or powers off. These static errors are straightforward to identify in large-scale fleets. If devices fail to power on or enumerate, simple health checks can verify their presence and configurations. As configurations and device scales grow in large training clusters, these faults occur more frequently but are easier to triage, root-cause, and repair, making them manageable at scale. \nTransient errors \nTransient errors, categorized by their reproducibility, include load-dependent or partially observable faults, such as device issues from thermal runaway or random crashes from uncorrectable errors. Mitigation involves understanding manifestation conditions; and our larger scale aids in triaging and pattern matching, setting traps for these conditions. When triggered, devices are marked for mitigation or repair. Advances in RAS telemetry in hyperscale infrastructure have greatly improved this process. Factors including workload sensitivity, temperature range, frequency, and manufacturing parameters contribute to these errors.\nMitigation can also involve inducing conditions with artificial workloads in non-production stages to make faults more repeatable. Additionally, capturing transient states as “sticky” status values provides telemetry indications for hardware failures. Though less frequent than static faults and harder to detect, Meta’s scale and our significant engineering efforts have made these scenarios detectable.\nSilent errors \nSilent errors or silent data corruptions (SDCs) occur when hardware miscomputes without leaving detectable traces, leading applications to consume incorrect results. These errors, often due to silicon defects, can remain unnoticed for long periods unless significant deviations are observed. Detecting them requires extensive engineering and costly telemetry to trace data corruption back to specific devices. These faults significantly impact large-scale services due to the lack of telemetry and continued consumption.\nCase studies, including one where a single computation error led to missing rows in a Spark application, highlight the prevalence of silent errors in hyperscale infrastructures. Historically, soft-error-related bitflips were reduced to one fault per million devices, but with increased silicon density in accelerators, silent data corruptions now occur at about one fault per thousand devices, much higher than cosmic-ray-induced soft errors.\nKey challenges presented by SDCs \nSDCs present significant challenges in hyperscale infrastructure due to their data dependency, creating an impractical exponential test space for all possible data values. These faults also depend on device voltage, frequency, operating temperature, and life cycle. For instance, a device may fail computational checks only after months of use, indicating a state of “wear out.” Therefore, consistent, periodic, and frequent testing within a random state space is necessary throughout the device’s life cycle to identify these inaccuracies.\n\nNovel SDC detection mechanisms \nTo protect applications from silent data corruption, Meta employs several detection mechanisms, as detailed in the papers, “Detecting Silent Errors in the Wild” and “Hardware Sentinel.”\nFleetscanner: Fleetscanner captures performance outliers at scale with targeted micro-benchmarks for identifying hardware defects. These benchmarks’ signatures are integrated into telemetry for non-benchmark-based detection. This approach involves running directed tests during maintenance operations such as firmware upgrades and hardware repairs. Tests are scheduled periodically, covering the entire fleet every 45 to 60 days. While it provides dedicated testing on hosts, it may be too slow for some SDCs.\nRipple: Ripple co-locates with workloads, executing tests in milliseconds to seconds, allowing fleet-wide coverage in days. It overlaps test instructions across cores and threads, providing faster detection than Fleetscanner.\nHardware Sentinel: This novel, test-and-architecture-agnostic approach evaluates application exceptions in kernel space. It identifies core-based anomalies as silent data corruption without requiring test allocations, operating solely in the analytical plane. Hardware Sentinel outperforms testing-based methods by 41% across architectures, applications, and data centers.\nCombined together, these three mechanisms provide one of the best in-fleet coverage at scale, for detecting and protecting our infrastructure against SDCs.\nSilent errors in AI hardware \nThe methodologies described above execute across the fleet and are fully productionized at scale, detecting SDCs across AI and non-AI infrastructure. However, AI applications such as training and inference have unique and more challenging implications for SDCs. \nSDCs in training workloads\nSDCs in training workloads lead to incorrect computations, affecting both forward and backward passes. This results in a divergence from the intended training path, impacting training efficacy. While AI training workloads are sometimes considered self-resilient to SDCs, this is true only for a limited subset of SDC manifestations. In most realistic scenarios, self-resilience is inadequate. SDCs persist across iterations, and the quantization of data values in AI training, which increases information per bit, exacerbates the impact of SDCs, continuously increasing divergence rates in training workloads.\nBelow we present the two most common cases of training divergence due to SDCs.\nNot-a-Number (NaN) propagation \nNot-a-Number (NaN) propagation occurs when an SDC pushes a representable value into an incorrect representation, generating a NaN during training computations. Once a NaN is created, it propagates through subsequent computations, affecting the training iteration, accelerator domain, host domain, and eventually the entire cluster. This widespread NaN contagion can lead to a cluster halt, as the source—often a few specific computations on a single accelerator—may be difficult to trace amidst the cluster’s scale. Identifying and quarantining the offending accelerator and nodes are necessary to resolve the issue.\nCorrupted gradient variance \nCorrupted gradient variance occurs when an SDC affects gradient calculations, leading to gradient explosion, implosion, or local minima. This corruption, while within numeric bounds, is mistakenly treated as correct, affecting the entire cluster in synchronous training. The corrupted values are exchanged as true values, causing the training to appear to progress without actual improvement. Over time, SDCs aggregate, causing major divergences in gradients, potentially trapping the algorithm in local minima or causing gradient explosions or implosions.\nDetecting these SDCs is challenging due to their subtlety and the time required to observe their effects, which can take weeks or months. Unlike NaN propagation, these corruptions are harder to trace and rectify, as they don’t trigger NaN traps. Consequently, SDCs can lead to significant unproductive use of computational resources and training iterations. Without detection, the root cause remains elusive, making subsequent training risky until the offending device is identified and isolated.\nSDCs in inference workloads\nIn inference applications, SDCs lead to incorrect results, which, due to the scale of operations, affect thousands of inference consumers. Persistent SDCs can directly impact decisions made by systems such as recommendation engines or LLM outputs. These corruptions can bypass policies related to privacy or integrity, as they are not constrained by boundaries. Consequently, inference corruptions significantly reduce the efficacy of models trained with substantial computational resources, making seemingly benign inference use cases problematic at scale.\nImpact of SDCs\nSDCs in training and inference clusters create complex debugging scenarios across thousands of components. \nIn training, visible faults halt the cluster, but SDCs create an illusion of progress, obscuring the fault source. NaN propagation requires identifying the offending node; otherwise, restarts from checkpoints will eventually fail. Corrupted gradient variance prolongs this illusion until variances aggregate, making restarts ineffective. SDCs thus cause significant computational inefficiency, with a larger temporal impact than visible faults.\nIn inference, triage involves costly telemetry at each substage. Until the offending node is identified, inference clusters can’t be used, risking repeat corruption. Large deviations are easier to detect with anomaly detectors, but smaller ones require extensive debugging. This process involves hundreds of engineers, halting production use cases, and impacting reliable capacity for serving production.\n\nDetection of SDCs in AI hardware \nMitigation strategies that we run in our infrastructure for dealing with SDCs in AI training workloads are classified into infrastructure strategies and stack strategies:\nInfrastructure strategies\nThese are applied during operational triage at the cluster level. They focus on managing and mitigating SDCs through the physical and network infrastructure, ensuring that the hardware and system-level components are robust and capable of handling errors effectively. \nReductive triage\nThis strategy involves conducting a binary search with mini-training iterations on progressively smaller cluster sizes to isolate NaN propagation. The goal is to identify a small cluster that replicates the NaN issue, allowing the offending node to be quarantined for further investigation. A reconstituted cluster with new nodes can then resume training from a saved checkpoint. However, this method relies on the ability to reproduce SDCs, which is not always guaranteed due to their dependence on data, electrical, and temperature variations. For corrupted gradient variance, a similar divide-and-triage approach can be used, but the effectiveness varies with training data and cluster size, despite consistent hyperparameter settings.\nDeterministic training\nThis approach involves running a known effective model for a few training iterations to ensure there are no NaNs or gradient divergences. It helps verify computational failures that are not data-dependent, as it guarantees correctness for a specific set of values and training inputs.\nHyper-checkpointing\nThis method involves creating checkpoints at increasingly high frequencies to facilitate faster identification and isolation of the corrupting node. It helps maintain training throughput while containing NaN propagation to a specific accelerator or host, thereby speeding up the triage and quarantine process.\nStack strategies\nThese require coordination with the workload and involve adjustments and enhancements at the software-stack level. This includes implementing error detection and correction mechanisms within the application and software layers to handle SDCs more effectively during training processes.\nGradient clipping\nThis strategy involves enforcing gradient clipping within the training workload to limit values within a specified range, thereby mitigating NaN propagation. Computations exceeding this range are clipped, and NaNs can be detected during this step by setting them to a max or min value based on the operand sign. While effective for some NaNs depending on representation format, it may introduce partial errors in certain cases.\nAlgorithmic fault tolerance\nThis robust approach integrates fault tolerance into training algorithms to handle a range of data corruptions, reducing the need for detection and triage. It enhances computational efficiency with minimal overhead, as demonstrated in CPU training. This method requires understanding common defect modes and investing in engineering across the stack, with modified guarantees to training workloads, albeit with some overhead to the overall training footprint.\nTri-variate computational training architecture\nThis approach uses shadow nodes in synchronous training to mitigate SDCs. Training steps are repeated across different nodes at random iterations, ensuring correct progress after verification. If shadow and live nodes differ, training halts, and only those nodes are investigated. The rest continue with new nodes. This method involves multiple shadow-node pools, a random training-node pool, and specified steps from the same checkpoint. It offers robust training but demands significant algorithmic changes and increased data movement and infrastructure overhead.\nParameter vulnerability factors\nThis approach identifies vulnerable and resilient layers in machine-learning architectures, allowing mapping of vulnerable layers to resilient hardware and resilient layers to unprotected hardware. This dynamic evaluation must scale with architecture evolution. Resilience often incurs costs in area, power, or performance, so PVF enables targeted resilient design, especially for inference.\nDivergence detection\nThis mechanism maintains a distribution map for each neuron to detect divergence from typical output distributions, identifying inference corruptions. Though costly, it can be applied at selected sampling rates for large-scale inference. By preserving each neuron’s behavior for specific workloads, divergence helps detect corruptions during execution.\nWhile we have optimized these different methodologies to run effectively in our infrastructure, it should be noted that they offer varying levels of resilience with distinct operating points and engineering/infrastructure overheads. Depending on the scale and intensity of training and inference workloads, orchestrating these strategies effectively can mitigate SDCs’ adverse effects in AI applications.\nPerformance faults and unknown unknowns!\nWhile SDCs are a major challenge at hyperscale, Meta has been developing solutions to detect performance regressions. ServiceLab, for example, is a large-scale performance testing platform that helps identify tiny performance regressions at scale. In addition,  Fleetscanner has identified hundreds of performance outliers, seen as an emergent fault mode alongside SDCs.\nWhile current mechanisms detect and address static, transient, and silent faults, the full range of hardware fault variants remains partially uncovered. The unknown unknowns require agile solutions across the entire infrastructure and silicon lifecycle, as well as across the hardware-to-software and application stack, to achieve first-class reliability operations.\nA journey towards industry leadership and standardization\nMeta’s journey toward industry leadership in SDC began with identifying frequent fleet issues in 2016, scaling SDC detection in 2018, and implementing detection frameworks by 2019. By 2020, detection mechanisms were integrated into accelerators, and Meta published the paper, “Silent Data Corruptions at Scale.” In 2022, Meta introduced “FleetScanner and Ripple” and conducted an RFP for academic awards, funding five winners. \nIn 2023, Meta collaborated with industry leaders (Google, Microsoft, ARM, AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel) to enhance server resilience, defining test architectures and metrics. A joint RFP with partners from the Open Compute Project selected six winners for cross-domain SDC research. By 2024, Meta’s fleet had advanced AI SDC detection methodologies in production, contributing to research through publications, tutorials, and talks at major conferences and forums, addressing at-scale reliability challenges.\n\nThe Meta Training and Inference Accelerator \nMeta is on an ambitious journey toward enabling training and inference accelerators under the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) family. On this journey, our goal is to utilize all the lessons learned from the fleet and move toward industry-leading, fleet-reliability practices in MTIA architecture and design practices. Using the factory-to-fleet approach, and consistently revisiting our reliability solutions across the stack, our goal is to deliver a best-in-class, reliable-and-performant solution to add to our infrastructure portfolio of AI hardware and to power AI applications at scale. \nFactory to fleet\nTo uncover unknowns early, a comprehensive factory-to-fleet view of the silicon life cycle is key. Innovation is needed in all phases, from design to deployment. In design and architecture, revisiting RAS solutions for scale, life-cycle debug hooks, and telemetry architectures can support tools such as Hardware Sentinel, Fleetscanner, and Ripple. During validation and integration, novel yield analysis, manufacturing diagnostics, and fleet-signature-feedback-based detection can prevent faults before shipping. In AI silicon fleets, user-space diagnostics with periodic testing, coverage maps, and control parameters are beneficial. Large-scale analytics like Hardware Sentinel can detect early wear out and data corruption. Robust firmware hooks and debug architecture provide fast feedback to design and architecture amidst fleet-scale issues.\n\nStack-level resilience\nFactory-to-fleet solutions offer life-cycle resilience for silicon, but resilience must extend beyond silicon to firmware, compilers, kernels, and operating systems. Investments in resilience architectures are needed for correctness-invariant-instruction heterogeneity and enhanced telemetry for exception tracing. Granular firmware-control mechanisms improve telemetry upon fault detection. At the software and application level, techniques like gradient clipping and algorithmic fault tolerance that we called out in this blog, are crucial for security amidst corruptions. Experience with SDCs shows that in-line software resilience and test-agnostic analytical approaches effectively scale for many SDCs with minimal investment, while testing-based approaches are limited to specific instructions.\n\nHardware faults significantly impact AI training and inference production. As cluster sizes and semiconductor complexity grow, fault complexity will exponentially increase. Solutions must involve factory-to-fleet coordination and stack-level resiliency. For AI applications, treating reliability as a primary design consideration is essential.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank all the cross-functional engineers and teams instrumental in landing these solutions over the years.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I was testing my agent built on Koog, JetBrains’ open-source framework for building AI agents in Kotlin. I fed it a task from SWE-bench-Verified, a real-world GitHub issue that tests whether AI can actually write code.\nFor the first 100 messages, everything looked promising. The agent methodically explored the codebase, identified bugs, wrote test cases, and attempted fixes. But as the conversation grew, it hit a fundamental limitation: the context window.\nEvery LLM has a maximum context size (the total amount of text it can process simultaneously). When your agent’s conversation history approaches this limit, you need to compress it somehow. Simply truncating old messages loses critical information, while generic summarization often misses essential details.\nKoog’s approach is more sophisticated. It extracts facts according to specific concepts you define, replacing the entire conversation history with these distilled insights:\nRetrieveFactsFromHistory(\n   Concept(\n       \"project-structure\",\n       \"What is the project structure of this project?\",\n       FactType.MULTIPLE\n   ),\n   Concept(\n       \"important-achievements\",\n       \"What has been achieved during the execution of this current agent\",\n       FactType.MULTIPLE\n   ),\n   Concept(\n       \"pending-tasks-and-issues\",\n       \"What are the immediate next steps planned or required? Are there any unresolved questions, issues, decisions to be made, or blockers encountered?\",\n       FactType.MULTIPLE\n   )\n   // ... more concepts\n)\n\n\n\n\nWhen compression was triggered, the agent should have continued working with extracted facts like “The bug is in sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex.py” and “Tests are located in sympy/parsing/tests/“. Instead, it started the entire task from scratch, as if suffering from complete amnesia.\nSomething was broken in our compression logic, so it was time to debug.\nThe investigation\n\n\n\n\nFirst, I looked at what we were sending to the LLM using our fact extraction logic. After ~100 chat messages of tool calls and results, I found the following:\nUser: Based on our previous conversation, what are the key facts about \"project-structure\" (What is the structure of this project?)\nThis was our initial implementation, and it was probably the most obvious approach – just ask the LLM to extract facts. Simple, right?\nWe should’ve gotten a summary, but instead we got this:\nAssistant: tool_name=report_plan(...)\nIt was not a summary, but another tool call. Suddenly, the amnesia made sense. Instead of useful facts, the compressed history contained gibberish like tool_name=report_plan(...). No wonder the agent started over – it had no meaningful information about its previous work.\n\nAsk for a summary, and the model responds with another tool call.\nThat raised a more disturbing question: Why was the LLM responding with tool calls when I explicitly asked for a summary?\nMy first thought was that maybe the available tools were confusing it. I tried sending an empty tool list to explicitly prevent any tool calls.\nThe response?\nAssistant: Tool call: read_dir(\"./src\")\nIt was calling tools that didn’t even exist anymore.\nThings were quickly getting weird. Maybe the system prompt was the culprit? My original agent system prompt read, “You’re a developer. Solve the user’s task, write tests, etc.” Could it be that this was overriding the summarization request?\nI tried making the summarization instruction the system prompt and demoting the original system message to a user message (as you can’t have two system messages).\nBut the tool calls just kept coming.\nThen I stopped to take a proper look at the message pattern:\nSystem: You are a developer, help the user complete their task... \nUser: Latex parsing of fractions yields wrong expression... \nTool call: read_dir(\".\") \nTool result: [directory contents] \nTool call: read_file(\"./README.md\") \nTool result: [file contents] \nTool call: write_file(\"./test/reproduce.py\", ...) \nTool result: File created successfully \nTool call: run_command(\"python -m pytest\") \nTool result: Tests failed \n[... 96 more tool calls and results ...] \nUser: Summarize the conversation above focusing on the following... \n\n\n\n\nThen it hit me – it wasn’t ignoring my instructions. After 100 examples of the pattern Tool call → Tool result → Tool call → Tool result, the model had learned that this conversation had exactly one acceptable response format: more tool calls.\nThe pattern prison\nFew-shot learning is one of our most powerful prompt engineering techniques. You show the model a few examples of input-output pairs, and it learns the pattern. We use it deliberately all the time.\nBut we’d created an implicit few-shot example without meaning to. Think about it from the model’s perspective. It’s seen 100 consecutive examples of:\nReceive a message\nRespond with a tool call\nReceive a tool result\nRespond with another tool call\nBy message 101, this pattern was so deeply reinforced that even explicit contrary instructions couldn’t break through. The model’s attention mechanism – the system determining what parts of the context to focus on – locked entirely onto the tool-calling pattern.\nI even found instances where the model tried to comply, but couldn’t escape the pattern. One response was:\nTool call: write_file(\n path=\"summary.txt\",\n content=\"Here is the summary of modified files: ...\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nIt was writing the summary, but as a file operation. The pattern was so strong that it reshaped the response format even when trying to follow the new instructions.\nBreaking free\nThe solution required thinking structurally, not semantically. We needed to break the messages’ pattern, not just add better instructions.\nThe key insight is that LLMs process conversations using special tokens (like < |im_start| > and < |im_end| >) that mark message boundaries. These tokens are part of their training, teaching them to recognize the structure of multi-turn conversations. When the model sees 100 instances of these tokens in a rigid pattern, it learns that this is how this conversation must continue.\nMy fix was to combine all messages into a single string, wrapped in custom XML-like tags:\nval combinedChatHistory = buildString {\n   append(\"<conversation_to_extract_facts>\\n\")\n   messages.forEach { message ->\n       when (message) {\n           is ToolCall -> append(\"<tool_call>${message.content}</tool_call>\\n\")\n           is ToolResult -> append(\"<tool_result>${message.content}</tool_result>\\n\")\n           // ... handle other message types\n       }\n   }\n   append(\"</conversation_to_extract_facts>\\n\")\n}\nThen build the final prompt:\nPrompt.build(id = \"swe-agent\") { \n   system (\"Summarize the content inside <conversation_to_extract_facts> focusing on 'project-structure' (What is the structure of this project?).\") \n   user (combinedChatHistory) \n}\nThis worked immediately. Here’s what changed:\nBefore: 100+ individual messages, each reinforcing the tool-calling pattern, followed by a user request.\nAfter: Just two messages in total: a system instruction to compress the history and the wrapped conversation data.\nTo the LLM, our XML tags are just content, not structural message boundaries. This let it finally “hear” the summarization request instead of being trapped in the learned pattern.\nThe final piece\n\n\n\n\nBreaking the pattern was only half the solution. Even with working compression, the agent acted confused after resuming. It would read the compressed facts, then start exploring the project from scratch, more efficiently thanks to the insights, but still from the beginning.\nOnce I considered it, the problem became obvious – we never told the agent what had happened. From its perspective, it suddenly saw a project summary it didn’t remember creating, almost like you or I waking up with someone else’s notes on our desk.\nThis revealed another quirk of LLM psychology. The fix was surprisingly elegant – have the agent explain the situation to itself:\nSystem: You are a developer, help the user complete their task... \n\nUser: Latex parsing of fractions yields wrong expression... \n\nAssistant: I was actively working on this task when I needed to compress my memory due to context limits. \nHere's what I accomplished so far: \n[summary of progress, modified files, current state] \nI'm ready to continue from where I left off.\n\nUser: Great, please continue.\n\n\n\n\nTwo subtle things make this work:\nSelf-trust: By having the Assistant role explain the situation, we leverage the model’s tendency to trust and maintain consistency with its own statements. Information from itself is more believable than external claims about what happened.\n\n\n\n\nNatural continuation: The final user message (“Great, please continue”) provides a natural prompt for action. If we ended with the assistant’s explanation, the model might consider the conversation complete, as no user response often signals the end of an interaction.\nThe agent seamlessly picked up where it left off, understanding why they lost all the chat history.\nWhat this means\nThis behavior reveals something fundamental about how LLMs process context. The context window isn’t just memory – it’s active training data that shapes behavior in real time. When patterns in that context are strong enough, they can override explicit instructions.\nFor anyone building agents or long-running LLM applications:\nWatch your patterns: Repetitive message structures create behavioral ruts. If your agent needs to do different types of tasks, ensure variety in your message patterns.\nStructure beats instructions: When you need to break a pattern, changing the structure (like our XML wrapping) is more potent than adding more instructions.\nSelf-consistency is powerful: LLMs strongly maintain consistency with their previous statements, which can be used to maintain continuity across context boundaries.\nThe fix is now part of Koog’s compression system. When you call RetrieveFactsFromHistory(...), it handles all of this automatically, breaking patterns, preserving context, and maintaining continuity. You don’t need to think about any of it – all you need to do is provide your concepts.\nIf you’re curious about the implementation details, the pull request is public.\nDenis Domanskii is an engineer at JetBrains working on AI agents. When he’s not teaching LLMs to forget their habits, he’s probably creating new ones.\nCo-authored by Claude Opus 4 from Anthropic, who spent 100 messages helping craft this article without once trying to call a non-existent tool.

Now this outstanding course is available right inside RustRover, JetBrains’ powerful Rust IDE! That means no setup headaches and no switching between websites and terminals – just hands-on Rust practice with full IDE support.\nIn this post, I’ll share my impressions of the course, walk you through what it’s like to learn Rust directly in RustRover, and offer a few practical tips to get the most out of the experience.\nTAKE THE COURSE\n                                    \nWhat you’ll learn from the exercises\nIn this course, you’ll learn all about Rust, starting from the basics like variable and control flow (if, match, and loops) to more advanced topics like traits, memory management, data structures, and even concurrency. While learning these topics, you’ll be implementing elements of a software project management system.\nThe 100 Exercises to Learn Rust course follows the learning-by-doing approach: First you learn a bite-sized piece of theory, then solve a tailor-made assignment. While the exercises are not particularly hard, they give you a good idea of the kinds of tasks you’ll be working on in real projects.\nYou don’t need any prior experience with Rust. You start from scratch, and then, thanks to the course’s project-based structure and step-by-step progression, you build on what you’ve already learned.\nThe course author, Luca Palmieri, has vast experience teaching Rust using these materials, so you can rest assured that the approach actually works.\nPracticing Rust in an IDE\nLuca’s original course consists of a website with theory lessons and a GitHub repository with the exercises. In RustRover, you can access both in one place:\nExperience seamless Rust learning: Read theory, solve problems, and check your solutions – right in RustRover\n\n\n\nThe great thing about doing this in RustRover is that, throughout this process, you get the full IDE experience. This means you can see the compiler errors and get help fixing them, debug your code, easily navigate between the course sections, get AI assistance, and check your solutions. And if you’re in serious trouble, you can even cheat and peek at the author’s solutions! Not that you would do that, of course. Getting your code to work the right way is where all the fun is! That said, once you’re happy with your solution, it might be useful to compare it with the author’s suggested solution.\nOne of the hidden advantages of taking this course inside RustRover is that you’re not just learning Rust – you’re also learning how to work productively in a professional-grade IDE. Every exercise is a chance to explore not just what your code does, but how your tools can help you understand and improve it. For example:\nRan into an error? RustRover can help you fix it with quick-fixes, AI suggestions, and even compiler-driven hints – right where the error appears.\nGot stuck on a bug? Step through your code with the built-in debugger. You’ll see variable values change and understand where things go wrong.\nCurious about how your project is structured? Navigate between files, track recent edits, and use search tools to move around faster.\nWant to edit your configuration? RustRover understands Cargo.toml, too – so it helps with suggestions, errors, and formatting even in your project settings.\nAs you go through the course, don’t just accept what the IDE shows you. Ask why. Why did it suggest this fix? Why is that warning showing up? Why does the compiler behave differently in debug vs. release mode? Exploring these questions deepens your understanding of Rust and builds fluency in the development environment you’ll likely use on real-world projects. By the time you’ve finished the exercises, you won’t just know more Rust – you’ll also have leveled up your tooling skills without even realizing it.\nHow to get started\nDownload and install RustRover. Then, enable its educational functionality: On the Welcome screen, go to the Learn tab, find the Learn to program widget, and click Enable Access.\nOnce access is enabled, click the Get Started button and select 100 Exercises to Learn Rust from the list. Alternatively, access the course by going to File | Learn and Teach | Browse Courses.\nRustRover is completely free for educational purposes, plus it supports Rust beginners with plenty of tailor-made features, all of which makes it the perfect tool for taking this course. Once you’re done with the course, you might also be interested in more recommendations on how to advance your Rust knowledge.\nSo, are you ready to become a Rustacean? With 100 practical exercises and a helpful IDE at your side, there’s no better way to get started.\nTAKE THE COURSE\n                                    \nHappy learning!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The upcoming GoLand 2025.2 release introduces a powerful set of new features and improvements designed to help you write safer, more reliable Go code. If you’d like a full breakdown of all the updates, be sure to check out the release notes. \nIn this post, we’ll focus on one of the most significant new features: interprocedural code analysis for detecting nil pointer dereferences. By helping you catch subtle bugs that often slip through code reviews and tests, this improvement makes your production code more stable and easier to maintain.\nThe GoLand team has put a lot of effort into delivering deeper, smarter static analysis to improve your development experience and help prevent those frustrating runtime panics. If you want to try this feature in your IDE, you can clone the following project from GitHub.\nnil pointer dereference in Go\nOne of the most common pain points in the Go programming language is nil pointer dereference, and nearly every Go developer has encountered it at some point. Despite Go’s simplicity and strong static typing, nil remains a source of subtle and often critical bugs.\nThe impact of a nil dereference can be severe, especially in production environments. A single unexpected dereference can crash an entire service, bringing down an API or worker process with little to no warning. \nIn Go, even more subtle issues can arise. Writing to a nil channel, for instance, can cause a goroutine to be blocked forever, potentially leading to deadlocks and cascading system failures. Attempting to access fields on an uninitialized nil pointer will result in an immediate panic. These kinds of errors are easy to overlook and hard to trace back once deployed.\nWhile some nil dereference issues can be caught through careful code review or testing, that’s not always enough. In fast-paced development cycles or large codebases, it’s easy for subtle nil-related bugs to slip through. Ideally, such issues should be detected automatically and as early as possible when writing the code.\nThis is where static code analysis comes in. GoLand already includes a built-in nil dereference inspection that performs local intraprocedural analysis. It works well for many common scenarios, detecting when a pointer might be nil within the scope of a single function.\nHowever, the current analysis only works within individual functions. It does not follow how values move between functions, so it can miss problems that involve multiple calls. These more complex cases are common in real-world Go code and are often the most dangerous. To catch them, we’ve implemented something more powerful: interprocedural code analysis.\nInterprocedural code analysis\nInterprocedural analysis, also called global analysis, helps you understand how values move through function calls. It looks beyond a single function to follow data across files and packages. In contrast, intraprocedural or local analysis only checks what happens inside one function. Local problems are often easy to catch by reviewing a single function. But global problems are harder to find because the source of an issue, such as a nil value, might be far from where it causes an error. That is why interprocedural analysis is especially useful for detecting nil dereference issues.\nFollowing the flow: Understanding nil dereferences\nNow let’s take a look at an example. This code looks pretty straightforward. We create a user using a constructor and print its fields. But the analysis gives us a warning: user.Age might cause a nil dereference.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try to investigate this manually. To understand what’s going on, we need to look at how the NewUser function is implemented. It is defined in a different file called model.go.\n\n\n\n\nThis constructor looks a bit strange: NewUser returns nil if an error occurs, but in main, we use the result without checking. This creates a potential nil dereference.\nTo fix this, we can rewrite NewUser to return both a result and an error – the more idiomatic Go style.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the code is safer. We check for an error before accessing user, so there is no risk of dereferencing nil. Although this code looks correct, we still see the same warning.\nTo figure out what’s going on, let’s dig in deeper and take a closer look at the implementation of CreateUser.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we find the second cause of the problem.\nIn the CreateUser function, there is a case where the code returns nil for both the user and the error.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a fairly common mistake in error handling. Returning nil without an error makes it look like everything went fine, while in reality the result is not valid. The caller checks only the error, sees that it is nil, and then tries to use the result. In our example, this leads to a crash when the code accesses user.Age.\nWe can fix this by returning an actual error when the input is not valid:\n\n\n\n\nWith this change, the code becomes correct, and the inspection no longer reports a nil dereference.\nFinding issues like this by hand can be slow and frustrating, especially in large projects. The place where a nil value is created might be far from where it causes a problem.\nThat is why GoLand highlights such issues right in the editor as soon as they are detected. For these warnings, we offer a dedicated context action: Explain potential nil dereference. This action opens the Data Flow Analysis tool window, where you get a step-by-step explanation of how the nil value flows through the code and where it is eventually used. This makes it much easier to understand and fix the issue without searching through the entire codebase.\n\n\n\n\nWhen nil slips through: Catching unsafe arguments and receivers\nOur analysis does more than track return values. It can also reason about parameter nilability by understanding whether a function expects a non-nil argument or can safely accept nil. This is particularly useful for catching cases where a nil value is unintentionally passed to a function that doesn’t handle it properly.\nLet’s take a look at another example:\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we call the Copy method on a user. At the same time, we pass nil as the context, assuming it is safe to do so. \nBut the inspection shows a warning: The context argument might cause a nil dereference as we pass a nil value as the context. Let’s check the implementation of the Copy method:\n\n\n\n\nIn this code, the method accesses ctx.isDebugEnabled without checking whether ctx is nil. If ctx is nil, the program will panic at runtime.\nTo fix this, we can make the ctx parameter nil-safe by adding an explicit nil check before accessing its fields.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith this change, the code becomes safe, and the warning at the call site disappears.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, that is not the only problem. The analysis also reports a potential nil dereference related to the user variable.\nTo understand why, we can use the Explain potential nil dereference action.\n\n\n\n\nThe process function allows user to be nil, and we pass it to Copy without checking. \nInside the Copy method, the receiver u is used before being checked. Specifically, u is passed to the logUserEvent function, where a dereference occurs when accessing the u.Name field. Therefore, if the user variable in the process function is nil, a nil dereference will occur.\nThese examples demonstrate that nil dereference issues are often subtle and easy to overlook. Even if the code looks clean and idiomatic, small assumptions can lead to runtime crashes. Tracing the root cause manually can be surprisingly tricky, especially when the origin of the nil value is created far from the place where it is used, separated from the dereference by multiple function calls, files, or packages.\nThis is where interprocedural analysis helps. It tracks how nil values move through function calls. Instead of guessing where the problem started, you can clearly see the full path from the origin to the point of dereference.\nQuick documentation now shows nilability information\nNilability analysis in GoLand is not just for highlighting issues in the editor. As you’ve already seen, our analysis can determine whether a function might return nil, and whether it’s safe to pass nil as an argument to a particular parameter. As the analysis understands how functions are expected to behave, we decided to make this information easy to access. That’s why we’ve integrated nilability information directly into the quick documentation popup.\nLet’s go back to the first example from earlier, before we applied any fixes. If we place the caret on the NewUser function and trigger the quick documentation, we will see a section called Nilability info. It shows the nilability of the function parameters and the return value. In this example, the function may return a nil result, and the quick documentation popup tells us that clearly.\n\n\n\n\nThe same feature works for parameters and receivers. In the second example, also before applying any fixes, the Nilability info section shows us that both the receiver u and the parameter ctx of the function are expected to be non-nil.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis small addition makes a big difference. With a quick lookup, you get an overview of important details, which can help you write safer code and reduce the risk of unexpected nil dereferences. However, keep in mind that not all cases are covered by the analysis, so always review the code carefully.\nLimitations and trade-offs\nThe first version of this analysis is simple and careful on purpose. It does not try to catch every possible nil dereference, and that is intentional. We’ve focused on the most common and important cases, aiming to keep false positives to a minimum. We’ll keep improving the analysis over time, adding new cases carefully. Our goal is to catch more problems without adding unnecessary noise.\nAvoid panics; embrace safety\nInterprocedural code analysis makes it much easier to catch and fix nil pointer dereference issues early. By tracking nil values across functions, files, and packages, this analysis makes it easier to understand the root causes of potential bugs before they hit production, reducing downtime and preventing costly incidents. \nWe’re excited to continue refining and expanding these capabilities in future updates. Stay tuned – and as always, we’d love to hear your feedback!\nThe GoLand Team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Our goal is to make remote development with JetBrains IDEs feel just as reliable and consistent as working locally does. Recently, we’ve made progress towards this goal in core areas like the editor, tool windows, plugin behavior, and settings synchronization. \nEditor\n\n\n\n\nAll the changes made to the editor in the 2025.2 release are based on a single underlying idea: to make remote editing feel as seamless and responsive as working locally.\nWe improved the way the editor opens in remote sessions. To reduce the perceived delay between user action and UI feedback, we’ve changed how fast different UI elements appear when opening a file. Now, when a file is opened in a remote session, the editor tab appears immediately, first with the tab frame and file name, followed by the file content as soon as it’s available.\nWe’re also experimenting with a skeleton view for cases where the editor content cannot be displayed fast enough, with the goal of making the UI feel more responsive. Once the data arrives, the skeleton is seamlessly replaced by the actual file content. Please share your feedback on this change!\n\n\n\n\nTo improve responsiveness, we’ve moved several basic editor actions to the frontend:\nThe clipboard now reliably captures the correct selection when copy-pasting, even when actions happen quickly.\nIdentifier highlighting under the caret now feels faster thanks to frontend caching. The first time something is highlighted, it’s calculated on the backend, but repeated highlights appear instantly while the file stays open.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Java plugin as an example, we’ve made progress toward smarter frontend execution by moving more functionality to the frontend. This includes:\nCode selection and navigation (brace matching and word selection).\nStatement and element movement (up/down and left/right).\nCode formatting and indentation.\nSmart Enter processing.\nSimple highlighting.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to these changes, the caret now moves much more predictably, even after smart backend updates are applied.\nWe’ve also extended this approach to SQL, JSON, YAML, TOML, and Ruby, which are now all available in the released version.\nThere is more work ongoing for upcoming releases, including native-feeling remote development support for other programming languages.\nDebugger\nWe’ve started rolling out a split frontend/backend architecture for the debugger. One of the biggest advantages is that the debugger is less coupled with the network delay. For instance, if you place or delete a breakpoint, it will be applied immediately, with a subsequent interaction with the backend. We’ve also added support for core debugging features like frames, variables, watches, and more, and we’re continuing to work on developing additional features. \nWhile not all functionality is in place yet, the current implementation is fully usable, and the missing features don’t block core debugging workflows.\nTerminal\nThe initial implementation of the split terminal was written between 2024.3 and 2025.1. We finally enabled it by default in 2025.2. The new release fixed many issues related to the previous version of the terminal, and the change was highly anticipated by many individual and corporate customers.\nThese updates improve the current experience and lay the foundation for future enhancements, ensuring new features will now work natively in remote development mode.\nPlatform functional windows\nPopups with long or dynamic lists have historically performed poorly in remote development scenarios, especially over unstable or high-latency connections. The redesigned versions now provide the same native-level performance when working remotely as they do when working locally, offering smooth scrolling and instant selection, even on slower or less reliable networks.\nSearch Everywhere: The most used features are now fully supported, and the popup performs smoothly in remote development scenarios.\nFind in Files: This popup now feels fast and responsive, and several long-standing issues have been resolved.\nGit Branch widget: We’ve improved this widget’s performance and responsiveness under high latency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlugin experience\nWith the latest release, we introduced synchronization of plugins between the client and the host. The IDE now installs the necessary plugins on the client machine based on the host’s setup and vice versa. This allows the development environment to remain consistent with minimal user involvement. The synchronization behavior can be configured depending on the security requirements in specific companies.\nIDE settings\nWe fixed an issue where various project settings were lost between IDE restarts. Recent updates make sure that selected UI and project-specific settings are preserved so that you can resume work exactly where you left off.\nHere’s what now persists correctly:\nIDE window size and position.\nLayout and state of tool windows.\nOpen files and their order.\nTool window-specific settings, such as appearance and behavior in the Project view.\nToolbox and remote development\nRemote development support in Toolbox was released in April, and while there’s still room for improvement, early feedback has been very positive. Several companies have confirmed that using Toolbox significantly improves connection stability.\nIn synthetic tests, we observed connection performance improvements of 1.5x or more:\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to performance gains, Toolbox supports OpenSSH, works with any major remote host’s OS (not just Linux, but Windows and macOS, too), and lets you manage everything from setup to updates in the same way you handle your IDEs locally. This results in a smoother remote workflow that’s built for how you actually work. You can read more about remote development with Toolbox in our recent blog post.\nWe’ve also added a new feature: If Toolbox is running, you can now see remote projects in the Recent Projects popup, right alongside your local projects.\nOther important improvements\nThis year, we focused on improving core functionality – frequently used windows, actions, and better separation of components and languages between the frontend and backend. Our goal is to build a unified architecture that works consistently in both monolith and remote development environments.\nThat said, there are still some tricky parts of the IDE stack to tackle, like syncing keymaps, color schemes, and other settings.\nWe’ve also fixed several bugs. Here are some of the most important ones:\nIJPL-168465/Client-forgets-keymap-periodically\nIJPL-167788/State-of-splitted-editors-isnt-restored-after-reconnecting-to-the-session\nIJPL-166434/Project-View-only-Project-and-Packages-views-are-available-in-RemDev\nIJPL-170464/Clicking-the-Select-opened-File-in-the-project-tree-on-a-file-of-an-external-lib-does-not-work\nIJPL-168465/Client-forgets-keymap-periodically",

Some features you might be using are being discontinued or transformed, while others are getting significant refinements. We believe that these changes will allow us to build better tools for everyone. \nWhat’s driving these changes\nOver the past year, we’ve been listening closely to our community through user surveys and interviews, as well as analyzing detailed usage statistics across our .NET tools. This data has given us valuable insights into how developers actually use our tools and where we should focus our development efforts.\nThe picture that emerged was clear: while we’ve built many powerful features over the years, some are underutilized, while others have tremendous potential that we haven’t fully realized. This led us to make some strategic decisions about streamlining our offerings to deliver more value where it matters most.\nChanges in the 2025.2 release\nStreamlining dotCover\nThe standalone dotCover tool will also receive significant streamlining to improve performance and reduce complexity. We’ve modernized the command-line runner, consolidating commands under a unified dotcover cover interface and transitioning from XML-based configuration files to simpler plain-text argument files. \nWe’ve also removed some rarely-used filtering options (method and class filters, file path filters, and in-source comment filters) and discontinued support for legacy application types, including IIS Express, WCF, WinRT, and external .NET processes. These changes significantly reduce overhead and allow our team to concentrate on the core coverage scenarios that matter most to modern .NET development workflows.\nEnd of code coverage for Mono and Unity projects in Rider\nRider 2025.2 will no longer provide coverage analysis for Mono and Unity projects via dotCover. Analyzing the low usage numbers, we realized that it significantly increases the technical debt for the team, which is now focused on performance improvements and branch coverage. \nWe plan to restore coverage analysis for Unity projects once Unity migrates to CoreCLR (expected after Unity 7 LTS). The list of available target application types in the cover application dialog will be reduced to .NET, .NET Core, Windows Service, and IIS.\nTeamCity extension for Visual Studio\nWe’ll be discontinuing the TeamCity extension for Visual Studio as part of our efforts to streamline tooling and focus on the most impactful developer experiences. While we understand this may affect some workflows, this decision enables us to concentrate on delivering better performance and more sustainable tool ecosystems.\nChanges coming in 2025.3\nTo make sure our development efforts deliver the most value, we’re adjusting how some features are maintained and delivered in Rider, based on actual usage patterns and technical considerations. \nDynamic Program Analysis (DPA) in Rider\nDPA is evolving. In Rider 2025.3, it will cease to be available as a separate tool, and instead, its analytical capabilities will be further integrated into the Monitoring tool. With this change, we aim to provide you with a powerful performance analysis experience while keeping your workflow simple. The DPA capabilities inside the Monitoring tool will be available under the dotUltimate license, alongside the already-integrated dotTrace and dotMemory profilers.\nWe’re here to help\nWe recognize some of these changes might affect established workflows. Our Support team is ready to help you find the best solutions for your specific needs. If these changes significantly impact your work or if you have suggestions for how we can better serve your development needs, please don’t hesitate to reach out.\nWhat’s your vision for dotUltimate?\nThese changes will help us free up significant development capacity and direct it towards improvements that matter most to our users. You can expect to see continued performance enhancements, stability improvements, and feature refinements that make development more productive and enjoyable.\nAs always, your feedback shapes our roadmap. Tell us about your vision for the dotUltimate set of tools! Is there anything missing from your toolbox that we could provide?

On Windows, the Monitoring tool also automatically detects performance bottlenecks, UI freezes, and GC issues. Detected problems and time intervals selected on the charts can be further investigated in dotTrace.\nWhat’s new in dotCover 2025.2 RC\nThis release introduces performance optimizations and removes support for some technologies with low usage. The following are no longer supported:\nMono and Unity projects.\nIIS Express, WCF, WinRT, external .NET processes, and MAUI.\n\n\n\n\nThe command-line runner has been updated and modernized:\ndotcover cover now handles all target types.\nXML configuration files have been replaced by text files with CLI arguments.\nThe .exe runner has been removed from the NuGet package. The standalone dotcover.exe runner has been removed from the NuGet package. The CLI runner is now available exclusively as a .NET global or local tool (requires .NET 6 or later).\n\n\n\n\nShare your feedback\nYou can download the latest build right now from the ReSharper 2025.2 EAP page or install it via the JetBrains Toolbox App.\nDownload ReSharper 2025.2 RC\n                                                    \nIt’s still not too late to share your feedback on the newest features!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Rider 2025.2 is shaping up to be a big release – especially if you’re a game developer. This update introduces powerful new debugging features for Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot, including source-level shader debugging, mixed-mode debugging for native and managed code, and stepping time improvements.\nBeyond game dev, Rider 2025.2 delivers a range of enhancements for performance, observability, and AI-powered productivity. With the new OpenTelemetry plugin, a reworked Monitoring tool window, and support for connecting external AI clients via MCP (Model Context Protocol), this release will help you build more performant and stable applications – and enjoy the process, too.\nDownload the RC and explore the changes:\nDownload Rider 2025.2 RC\n                                                    \nRelease highlights\nReworked Monitoring tool with automatic issue detection\nThe Monitoring tool window has been entirely reimagined to make performance optimization for .NET applications simpler and more insightful. You’ll find new interactive charts, automatic issue detection on Windows, and seamless integration with Rider’s bundled profilers, dotTrace and dotMemory. With just a couple of clicks, you can navigate from a performance issue to the responsible method in the editor.\nOpenTelemetry plugin for in-IDE runtime observability\nRider now offers an OpenTelemetry plugin, bringing runtime metrics and logs directly into your IDE. You can visualize app behavior, generate architecture diagrams, and click through from logs to the exact source code – all without leaving Rider or opening an external dashboard. Learn more about the new tool here.\nThe OpenTelemetry plugin also integrates with MCP Servers, allowing AI tools to access logs, architecture diagrams, and other observability data.\nOne-click MCP server setup to connect external AI clients to Rider\nStarting with version 2025.2, JetBrains IDEs come with an integrated MCP server, allowing external clients such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and others to access tools provided by the IDE. This provides users with the ability to control and interact with JetBrains IDEs without leaving their application of choice.\nFor external clients like Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code, and Windsurf, configuration can be performed automatically. Go to Settings | Tools | MCP Server, click Enable MCP Server, and in the Clients Auto-Configuration section, click Auto-Configure for each client you want to set up for use with the MCP server. This will automatically update their JSON configuration. Restart your client for the configuration to take effect.\nPerformance improvements\nImproved memory consumption\nWe’ve fine-tuned Rider’s garbage collection settings, reducing peak managed memory usage by GC up to 20% – especially helpful when working on large codebases.\nFaster debugger stepping\nStepping through code is now snappier, even when working with complex watches like large Unity objects or LINQ expressions. Rider now cancels unnecessary evaluations earlier for a smoother debugging experience.\nCode analysis and language support\nExtended C# 14 support\nRider 2025.2 brings initial support for the latest additions in C# 14, as well as a range of other improvements to code analysis. Here are some highlights:\nExtension members: Initial support for code completion, usage search, and refactorings.\nPartial events and constructors.\nNull-conditional assignments using a?.b = c and a?[i] = c.\nUser-defined compound assignment operators.\nRoslyn support\nRoslyn support in this release includes enhanced CompletionProvider functionality, enabling richer context-aware code completion through analyzers and community packages. It also introduces Roslyn suppressors, which silently suppress diagnostics in the background to reduce noise and improve clarity in the editor.\nF# improvements\nThe F# plugin brings better import suggestions, smarter code annotations, improved type inference, and fixes for interop issues and F# scripts.\nDebugger updates\nNative debugging improvements\nLow-level exception suppression: You will now be able to prevent Rider from breaking on framework-level assertions like int3, either globally or at runtime.\nStep filters: Skip over library functions by treating Step Into as Step Over for selected methods.\nPause All Processes: Coordinate debugging across multiple processes with new actions to pause, resume, or stop them together.\nRemote native debugging: Attach to native processes on a remote machine via SSH. [Windows only]\nGame development\nUnity\nShader debugging: Debug ShaderLab code in Rider using the integrated Frame Viewer with full support for breakpoints, draw calls, texture inspection, and more. [Windows only]\nMixed-mode debugging: Step seamlessly between managed (C#) and native (C++) code in Unity projects. [Windows only]\nUnity Profiler integration is now enabled by default to display profiling results directly in your editor.\nUnreal Engine\nShow Usages for UINTERFACE in Blueprints.\nCode completion for BlueprintGetters and Setters.\n.uproject loader suggestions: Use the native .uproject format instead of generating solution files, simplifying project setup on Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nGodot\nFor Godot development, Rider now bundles a new GDScript plugin, providing:\nSmarter completions for nodes and resources.\nCtrl+Click navigation, the Rename refactoring, and Find Usages.\nScene Preview tool window with interactive tree, parent method highlights, and performance monitors.\nDeeper code inspections, stricter untyped value handling, and many fixes for test running and C++ build scenarios.\nWeb and database development\nTypeScript-Go language server support\nRider 2025.2 introduces experimental support for the new TypeScript-Go language server, bringing improved performance and modern architecture to TypeScript development.\nYou can enable it in your project by installing the @typescript/native-preview package as a dependency in place of TypeScript. Rider will automatically detect and use the correct language server.\nSQL project support \nRider now provides support for SQL database projects via a new bundled plugin. The plugin works out of the box and delivers a smoother experience when working with SQL database projects.\nDeprecations and notices\nCode coverage for Mono and Unity has been removed in this release due to low usage and high maintenance costs. Coverage may return once Unity adopts CoreCLR.\nDynamic Program Analysis (DPA) will be sunset in Rider 2025.3, with parts of its functionality integrated into the new Monitoring tool window for a more consistent performance analysis experience.\nYou can download and install Rider 2025.2 RC from our website right now:\nDownload Rider 2025.2 RC\n                                                    \nWe’d love to hear what you think.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re excited to announce the launch of TeamCity 2025.07! This release brings a range of improvements across the UI, Perforce integration, recipes, and more. \nIt is also the first version to include pipelines: a reimagined TeamCity experience that focuses on a healthy balance of functionality and an intuitive design-first workflow.\nRead on to learn what’s new.\nPublic recipes\nIn version 2025.03, we announced the deprecation of classic TeamCity meta-runners and a shift to fluent, YAML-based recipes. You can now find around 20 JetBrains-authored recipes on JetBrains Marketplace. These extend TeamCity’s built-in capabilities with integrations for various tools (AWS CLI, Slack, Node.js, and more) and introduce automation for routine actions like pinning builds, tagging, and publishing artifacts mid-build.\nThis release also introduces support for third-party recipes. You can now upload your own to the Marketplace and explore community-created options. All third-party recipes are verified by JetBrains and certified as safe to use in any project.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more: Working with recipes\nUI updates\nAs part of our ongoing effort to simplify and enhance the TeamCity UI, this release introduces several updates. Highlights include a redesigned side panel that can now auto-hide to maximize your workspace, a new What’s New widget to keep you informed of key updates, an improved Projects dropdown menu, and more.\nTeamCity pipelines now in early access\nIn several earlier release cycles, we introduced major UI updates to pave the way for integrating TeamCity Pipelines into the core product. With the 2025.07 update, pipelines are finally available on regular TeamCity servers as part of our Early Access Program (EAP).\n\n\n\n\nPipelines offer an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed to simplify CI/CD setup. Easily configure private container and NPM registry connections in a few clicks, use YAML to create building routines from scratch, manage output files and parameters from a single menu, define job dependencies using our visual editor’s intuitive drag-and-drop interface, and more.\n\n\n\n\nThat said, pipelines are still evolving and currently support a very limited number of build steps and features. We expect to deliver the first feature-complete version of this functionality in TeamCity 2025.11. \nTo avoid confusing users who expect the full range of TeamCity capabilities without compromise, we’ve opted to keep pipelines initially hidden from the main TeamCity UI.\nIf you’re ready to give the pipelines EAP a try, head over to the dedicated page or click the Join Early Access program link in the TeamCity UI. You’ll find a transparent overview of current features, limitations, and our roadmap. \nLeave your email, and we’ll send you simple setup instructions – it only takes a few clicks and doesn’t require you install any additional patches or software beyond your 2025.07 server.\nSign up for early access\n                                                    \nProject isolation\nBy default, any project’s build configuration can add snapshots and artifact dependencies to your configurations. This means any external project can start new builds and/or import artifacts produced by your configuration.\nStarting with version 2025.07, you can isolate sensitive configurations using the corresponding Project isolation section of your project settings.\n\n\n\n\nLearn more: Project isolation\nKubernetes Executor updates\nIntroduced several releases ago, Kubernetes executor leverages your existing Kubernetes clusters by turning them into independent orchestrators for TeamCity builds. Unlike with regular cloud agents that are fully managed by TeamCity, this integration allows the server to offload the build queue to a k8s cluster, granting the latter full control over the pod lifecycle.\nTeamCity 2025.07 introduces a range of Kubernetes executor updates:\nExecutors are now natively integrated into TeamCity’s default prioritization mechanism. When a build is queued, TeamCity first checks for a free self-hosted agent, then for cloud profiles that can launch a compatible agent. If none are available, the build is offloaded to an executor.\nImplicit agent requirements are now correctly recognized. Build steps can impose implicit tooling requirements on agents, like requiring Docker or Podman for containerized steps, or the .NET 8 SDK for .NET builds. As of 2025.07, TeamCity can correctly match these requirements with pod specifications, ensuring builds are never offloaded to executors that cannot run them.\nThere are numerous bug fixes for various issues, such as TeamCity ignoring the maximum build limit, PowerShell steps failing to run, excessive build log errors, and more.\nLearn more: Kubernetes Executor\nEnhanced build approval conditions\nBefore version 2025.07, each build approval rule was treated as a separate condition. All conditions had to be met for the build to proceed. For instance, the following setup requires four votes: two from the QA group, one from a team lead, and one from a project admin:\nuser:teamlead\nuser:projectadmin\ngroup:QA:2\nStarting with TeamCity 2025.07, you can merge individual users and groups into a single entity with a shared vote count. The following rule now only requires any two votes from members of the specified groups:\n(groups:QA,users:teamlead,projectadmin):2\nThis allows flexible combinations, such as two QA members, one QA member and a team lead, etc.\nLearn more: Build approval\nPerforce integration enhancements\nSupport for multiple shelve triggers\nBuild configurations now support multiple Perforce shelve triggers. Previously, adding one trigger blocked the option to add more via the TeamCity UI.\nClear TeamCity-generated workspaces\nYou can now clear both agent and server workspaces created by TeamCity.\nConfigurations with stream-based Perforce VCS roots now feature an updated Delete Perforce Workspaces… dialog. It lets you remove inactive workspaces created by build agents, with the inactivity period (in days) selectable within the dialog.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perforce Administrator Access connection and Perforce VCS root settings now include an option to automatically remove workspaces created by TeamCity build agents. Enabling this in the VCS root clears workspaces from both bare-metal and cloud agents after builds finish, while the connection setting removes cloud agent workspaces during scheduled server clean-ups.\nMiscellaneous enhancements\nArtifacts with identical names produced by different batches of parallel tests are now shown in separate tabs. Previously, the Artifacts tab showed only the most recently produced artifact.\nTeamCity now recognizes the <kotlin.compiler.incremental>true</kotlin.compiler.incremental> line in DSL pom.xml files, which allows you to enable incremental compilation for your Kotlin scripts.\nYou can now override the server callback URL that TeamCity OAuth connections utilize by setting the new teamcity.oauth.redirectRootUrlOverride internal property.\nSSH keys uploaded or generated in TeamCity are now stored in encrypted form, reducing the risk if the data directory is compromised. Keys added before the server upgrade remain unencrypted, so you must re-upload them to enable encryption.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve been thrilled to see so many of you jump back into your Pluralsight benefit after our April 3rd announcement about extended access. Your enthusiasm for learning and leveling up with Visual Studio inspires us every day. If you haven’t had a chance to dive in yet—or want to explore what’s new since then—I wanted to share an update on some exciting new courses and paths that we think you’ll find especially valuable.\nMore Time to Learn, More Ways to Grow\nVisual Studio developers on a paid Professional or Enterprise subscription unlock exclusive learning opportunities—Professional subscribers receive 6 months of complimentary Pluralsight access, while Enterprise subscribers get a full 12 months. That’s even more time to immerse yourself in expert-led courses, hands-on labs, and certification prep, all tailored to the latest Microsoft technologies.\nWhy does this matter? Because we know how busy developers are juggling projects, deadlines, and meetings. Pluralsight offers you the flexibility to learn at your own pace, whenever and wherever it fits your schedule.\nWhat’s New on Pluralsight?\nPluralsight was recently named a Leader in the 2025 Forrester Wave, earning the highest scores in strategy, hands-on learning, skill benchmarking, innovation, and partner ecosystem. This platform is built to help you grow your career with courses designed by industry experts — and the content keeps evolving.\nHere are some of the standout new courses you’ll want to check out:\nVS Code Foundations (Beginner, Published July 2025)\nMany developers switch between Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code, choosing the right tool for different tasks. This course helps you get comfortable with VS Code’s interface, extensions, command palette, source control, and AI-powered features—so you can make the most of both environments.\nSecure Development with GitHub Copilot (Beginner, Published May 2025)\nGitHub Copilot can speed up your coding, but like any powerful tool, security matters. Learn how to configure Copilot to keep your company’s intellectual property safe, find vulnerabilities in your code, and fix them before they become problems. This course is essential for writing secure software with AI-assisted coding.\nPrompt Engineering (Beginner, Published April 2025)\nGenerative AI is everywhere, but knowing how to ask the right questions is key. This learning path teaches you how to craft effective prompts that produce precise, context-aware outputs with models like GPT-4. Perfect for developers and data scientists eager to unlock AI’s full potential.\nGenerative AI and Copilot in Microsoft Fabric (Intermediate, Updated March 2025)\nImagine having a sidekick that helps you create, troubleshoot, and analyze data with AI-driven insights. This course shows you how to leverage Copilot and generative AI across Microsoft Fabric services like data pipelines and Power BI to boost your productivity and creativity.\nAutomating Azure Blob and Archive Storage Operations (Advanced, Updated May 2025)\nCloud automation is a must-have skill. Learn how to automate Azure storage workflows, implement infrastructure as code, and integrate securely with your existing systems in this deep dive.\nDesigning Serverless Architectures with Azure Functions (Advanced, Updated May 2025)\nBuild scalable, event-driven cloud applications with Azure Functions. Explore microservice patterns, event integration, monitoring, and security best practices for serverless architectures.\nReady to Unlock Your Extended Pluralsight Access?\nIf you’re a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriber, your Pluralsight access is waiting for you.

        "contentSnippet": "AI 미니 앱, 복잡한 코딩 없이 만들 수 있을까? Google Opal로 당신의 아이디어를 현실로!\n\n\n \n 혹시 머릿속에 번뜩이는 아이디어가 있는데, 그걸 현실로 만들려면 복잡한 코딩을 해야 한다는 생각에 지레 포기한 적 있으신가요? 제가 딱 그랬어요. 막연하게 '이런 AI 도구가 있으면 정말 좋겠다!' 생각만 했지, 개발은 엄두도 못 냈죠. 그런데 Google Opal을 만나고 나서는 생각이 싹 바뀌었답니다! 이 글에서는 Google Opal이 대체 뭔지, 그리고 어떻게 우리의 아이디어를 손쉽게 AI 앱으로 바꿔주는지 자세히 알려드릴게요. \n \nGoogle Opal, 도대체 뭘까요? \nGoogle Opal(opal.withgoogle.com)은 한마디로 자연어를 사용해서 미니 AI 앱을 만들고, 편집하고, 공유할 수 있는 Google의 실험적인 플랫폼이에요. 코딩을 몰라도 내가 원하는 AI 기능을 직접 만들어 볼 수 있다는 게 정말 매력적이죠. 저는 처음에 ‘이게 정말 가능하다고?’ 싶었는데, 직접 써보니 생각보다 훨씬 쉽더라고요.\n \n보통 AI 앱을 만들려면 파이썬 같은 프로그래밍 언어도 배워야 하고, 데이터도 준비해야 하고… 머리 아픈 일이 한두 가지가 아니잖아요? 그런데 Opal은 그런 복잡한 과정들을 확 줄여줘요. 그냥 우리 일상 언어로 명령을 내리면, 그걸 AI가 알아듣고 앱으로 만들어주는 방식이랄까요? 정말 신기하더라고요.\n  알아두세요!\nOpal은 Google의 실험적인 도구로, AI 기반 애플리케이션을 간단하게 구축하는 데 초점을 맞추고 있어요. 사이트에 접속하면 'Sign in'을 통해 로그인할 수 있답니다.\n \n어떤 기능들을 지원하나요? \nOpal은 단순한 앱 제작을 넘어 다양한 기능들을 제공해서 사용자가 더 쉽게 AI 앱을 만들고 관리할 수 있도록 돕습니다. 제가 써보니 특히 시각화 기능이 정말 좋았어요. 앱의 구조를 한눈에 볼 수 있어서 뭔가 머릿속에 그림이 그려진달까요?\n가장 핵심적인 기능들을 표로 정리해봤어요. 이 기능들 덕분에 코딩 지식이 없는 저도 꽤 근사한 AI 미니 앱을 만들어 볼 수 있었답니다.\nGoogle Opal 주요 기능\n구분\n설명\n장점\n\n\n\n\n미니 AI 앱 구축\n자연어 명령으로 앱 생성 및 편집\n복잡한 코딩 없이 직관적 개발\n\n\n편집 및 공유\n생성된 앱 수정 및 다른 사용자와 공유\n협업 용이, 아이디어 확장 가능\n\n\n시각화\n연결된 단계의 그래프 형태로 앱 구조 표현\nAI 흐름 직관적 이해, 디버깅 용이\n\n\nGoogle Workspace 통합\nGmail, Docs 등과 연동하여 자동화\n업무 생산성 극대화, 반복 작업 감소\n\n\n\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nOpal은 아직 Google의 실험적인 도구예요. 기능이 계속 추가되고 변경될 수 있으니 최신 정보를 확인하는 게 중요하겠죠?\n \nn8n이나 Make와는 무엇이 다를까요? \n제가 Opal을 처음 접했을 때 '어? 이거 n8n이나 Make랑 비슷한 거 아니야?' 싶었어요. 시각적인 인터페이스에서 노드(블록)를 연결해서 워크플로우를 만든다는 점에서는 확실히 비슷하더라고요. 여러분도 그렇게 생각하셨죠? 하지만! 목적과 구성 요소에서 결정적인 차이가 있답니다.\n쉽게 말해서, n8n이나 Make는 이미 만들어진 레고 블록(Gmail, Slack 등)을 설명서대로 연결해서 멋진 디오라마(자동화 흐름)를 만드는 것과 같아요. 각 블록은 이미 기능이 정해져 있죠. 반면에 Google Opal은 찰흙(AI 모델)을 주무르고, 모양을 다듬고, 색을 칠하는 각 단계를 연결해서 세상에 없던 새로운 피규어(AI 앱)를 만드는 것과 비슷해요. 재료의 특성을 활용해서 완전히 새로운 걸 창조하는 거죠!\nOpal vs n8n/Make 주요 차이점\n구분\nGoogle Opal\nn8n / Make\n\n\n\n\n핵심 목적\n자연어 기반 미니 AI 앱 제작\n기존 앱/서비스 간 프로세스 자동화\n\n\n주요 구성 요소\nAI의 행동을 정의하는 논리 블록\n특정 앱의 기능(API) 블록\n\n\n결과물\n독립적인 AI 프로그램 (예: 블로그 글 생성기)\n자동화된 업무 흐름 (예: 이메일 알림)\n\n\n주요 사용자\n간단한 AI 툴을 만들고 싶은 창작자, 기획자\n반복 업무를 줄이고 싶은 마케터, 비즈니스 운영자\n\n\n\n  알아두세요!\n결론적으로, '블록을 시각적으로 연결한다'는 방법론은 동일하지만, 그 블록의 내용물이 'AI의 논리'인지 '기존 앱의 기능'인지, 그래서 최종 목표가 '새로운 AI 앱 개발'인지 '기존 업무 자동화'인지가 근본적으로 다르답니다.\n \n실전 예시: 유튜브 영상을 블로그 기사로 만드는 앱 \nGoogle Opal은 정말 다양한 AI 미니 앱을 만들 수 있는 잠재력을 가지고 있어요. 제가 개인적으로 가장 만들어보고 싶었던 기능 중 하나는 바로 '유튜브 영상을 블로그 기사로 만드는 앱'이에요. 요즘 유튜브에 정말 좋은 정보들이 많잖아요? 그런데 그걸 블로그 글로 정리하려면 시간도 많이 들고 번거롭더라고요.\n사례 소개: 유튜브 요약 블로그 포스터 생성 AI\n목표: 유튜브 영상 URL을 입력하면, 영상 내용을 요약하고 이를 바탕으로 블로그 기사 초안을 생성해주는 앱\n주요 기능: 유튜브 영상 스크립트 추출, AI를 통한 핵심 내용 요약, 블로그 형식에 맞는 글 초안 생성 (서론, 본론, 결론 포함), 관련 이미지 프롬프트 제안\nOpal에서의 과정 (예상)\n1) 시작 블록: '사용자에게 유튜브 영상 URL 입력받기'\n2) 데이터 처리 블록: '입력된 URL에서 영상 스크립트 추출 및 텍스트 변환'\n3) AI 분석 블록: '추출된 스크립트에서 핵심 내용, 주요 키워드, 주제 파악 후 텍스트 요약'\n4) 생성 블록: '요약된 내용을 바탕으로 블로그 기사 초안 생성 (HTML 형식 포함)'\n5) 출력 블록: '생성된 블로그 기사 초안과 대표 이미지 생성 프롬프트 제공'\n\nopal로 유튜브 영상을 블로그 기사로 만드는 앱  만들기\n\n 이런 앱이 있다면 정말 편리하겠죠? Opal은 이렇게 복잡해 보이는 작업도 단계별로 쪼개어 AI의 도움을 받아 쉽게 자동화할 수 있도록 도와줘요. 유튜브 크리에이터나 블로거들에게 정말 혁신적인 도구가 될 수 있을 것 같아요!\n \n마무리: 핵심 내용 요약 \n오늘은 Google의 실험적인 프로젝트, Opal에 대해 알아봤는데요. 어떠셨나요? 복잡한 코딩 없이도 자연어만으로 나만의 AI 미니 앱을 만들 수 있다는 점이 정말 흥미롭지 않나요?\n \n \nGoogle Opal 핵심 요약\n✨ AI 앱의 민주화: 복잡한 코딩 없이 자연어로 AI 미니 앱을 만들 수 있어요! 아이디어를 빠르게 현실로.\n  직관적인 시각화: 단계별 그래프로 AI 앱의 흐름을 한눈에! 개발 과정이 훨씬 쉬워져요.\n  자동화와 차별점: 기존 자동화 툴과 달리 새로운 AI 앱을 '창조'하는 데 집중! 단순 연결을 넘어섭니다.\n  Google Workspace 통합: Gmail, Docs 등과 연동하여 업무 효율 극대화! 반복 작업은 이제 그만.\n궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐 주세요! 함께 AI 시대를 만들어가요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: Google Opal은 유료 서비스인가요?\nA: 현재 opal.withgoogle.com은 Google의 실험적인 프로젝트로, 별도의 요금 정보는 제공되고 있지 않습니다.

TDS(토스 디자인 시스템)와 앱 빌더*를 활용해 토스의 제품 철학이 자동으로 적용되도록 설계했기 때문이에요.\n*앱 빌더는 토스의 내부 디자인 툴을 부르는 명칭으로, 앱인토스에서는 이러한 디자인 시스템을 직접 활용할 수 있어요. \n덕분에 파트너사가 별도로 토스의 제품 철학을 학습하지 않아도, 도구 자체에 토스 제품 디자이너들의 노하우와 원칙이 내재되어 파트너사의 서비스에 자연스럽게 구현됩니다.\n여기서 한 걸음 더 나아가, 각 직군이 필요로 하는 전문 도구들도 함께 제공해요. 기획자는 TUBA*를 통해 MVP 제작에 필요한 유저 테스트부터 빠른 이터레이션까지 시행할 수 있어요. 아침에 실험을 세팅하고 저녁에 결과를 즉시 확인하며 제품 개선 과정을 체계적으로 진행할 수 있죠.\n*TUBA란 Toss User Behavior Analyzer의 축약어로, 토스 유저 행동 분석 툴이라는 의미예요. 토스의 유저 행동을 데이터로 분석할 수 있는 토스 내부 인프라입니다. 아래 이미지처럼 직접 캠페인을 세팅하고 푸시를 보내는데 활용할 수도 있어요.\n\n엔지니어는 토스가 제공하는 SDK(개발 도구 모음)와 다양한 개발 인프라를 활용해 기존보다 훨씬 쉽게 구현할 수 있고요. 마케터라면 직접 2,900만 유저 중 서비스에 적합한 타겟을 설정하고 푸시를 발송할 수도 있어요. 동시에 유저 리텐션, 퍼널 전환율, 코호트 분석 등 다양한 지표를 수집해 데이터 기반 의사 결정까지 가능합니다. \n이 결과 토스 유저들은 앱 구석구석에서 미니앱을 만날 수가 있습니다. 구체적으로는 ‘전체’ 탭에 있는 게임 홈, 미니앱 홈은 물론 토스 서비스 맥락과 닿아 있는 서비스 화면이나 관련 검색어 입력 시에도 파트너사의 서비스를 만나고 이용할 수 있게 되죠. \n\n또한 초기 서비스, 스타트업들이 가장 어려워하는 고객 획득 과정(AARRR) 단계에서 앱 다운로드와 회원 가입, 결제수단 등록과 같은 과정을 토스 인증과 토스페이로 한번에 해결할 수 있습니다.\n“실제로 유저 인터뷰를 해보면 ‘멤버십 혜택은 좋은데, 초반에 설치하고 로그인하는 과정이 번거로워서 이용을 망설이는’ 경우가 있다고 해요. 이런 유저들을 잡고 싶은 파트너에게 특히 앱인토스가 유용할 것으로 생각합니다.” - 제품팀 권순우 \n앱인토스에서 유저가 서비스를 발견하는 방식을 설계할 때 가장 중요하게 고려한 점은 바로 유저의 편의성과 서비스로의 즉각적인 전환이었습니다. 이를 위해 서비스를 소개할 때 브랜드명보다 기능 설명을 먼저 배치하는 전략을 택했어요.\n이는 토스의 핵심 제품 철학 중 하나인 ‘Value First, Cost Later’ 원칙을 구현한 것이에요. 유저가 얻을 수 있는 가치를 먼저 명확히 제시하여 즉각적인 전환을 유도하는 앱인토스만의 설계 철학이죠.\n파트너사의 브랜드 성장도 함께 고려합니다. 유저가 미니앱 이용 시 해당 브랜드로 이동한다는 안내가 명확히 표시되고, 재사용 시에는 브랜드명이 우선 노출되어 브랜드 인지도 향상에도 기여해요.\n\n이처럼 앱인토스 팀은 파트너사가 진짜 필요로 하는 것을 깊이 이해하기 위해, 끊임없이 탐색합니다. 파트너사들이 그로스 차원에서 고민하는 것과 실제 과정을 이해하기 위해 정기적으로 그룹 인터뷰를 진행하고, 파트너사와의 직접적인 소통을 통해 해상도 높은 니즈 파악을 위해 노력해요.\n개인부터 기업까지 \n모두 성장할 수 있어요\n앱인토스는 현재 1인 개발자부터 이름만 들으면 아는 브랜드까지 다양한 규모의 파트너사가 함께 하고 있어요. 규모를 불문하고 모든 파트너가 성장할 수 있는 환경을 제공하고 있기 때문입니다.\n1인 개발자와 초기 스타트업에게는 앱인토스가 강력한 성장 동력이 됩니다. 일반적으로 해당 규모에서 구축하기 어려운 마케팅 도구와 데이터 분석 시스템, 결제 인프라를 제품 초기부터 활용할 수 있거든요.\n중간 규모의 기업에게는 효율적인 실험 환경을 제공합니다. 새로운 서비스나 기능을 테스트할 때 필요한 복잡한 준비 과정과 초기 비용 부담 없이, 빠르게 시장 검증을 진행할 수 있어요.\n이미 시장에서 인지도가 있는 브랜드에게는 새로운 추가 매출의 기회를 제공합니다. 파트너사는 앱인토스 내에서 자체적으로 인앱 결제를 통한 유료 서비스나 광고를 운영할 수 있어 추가적인 매출 창출이 가능합니다.\n이처럼 토스가 앱인토스를 통해 그리고 있는 건 단순한 미니앱 플랫폼이 아닙니다. 좋은 아이디어를 가진 사람이라면 누구나, 규모와 상관없이 성공할 수 있는 기회를 만들고자 합니다.\n이미 앱인토스를 적극적으로 활용하며 좋은 성과를 얻은 사례도 있어요. 해외 송금 전문 핀테크 기업 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}‘모인’은 신규 가입자가 약 40% 증가하고, 부동산 인공지능 에이전트 서비스 기업인 ‘안전집사’는 앱인토스에서 서비스 출시 후 유저 트래픽의 90%가 앱인토스로 발생하는 결과도 얻게 되었어요.\n‘앱인토스만으로 IPO까지’\n토스가 그리는 앱인토스의 미래 \n\"앱인토스와 함께하는 파트너사들이 앱인토스만으로 기업 공개(IPO)까지 성공했으면 좋겠어요.\" - 제품팀 권순우\n앱인토스는 메이커들이 성장할 수 있는 최적의 환경을 조성하고, 그들의 성공이 곧 토스의 성공으로 이어지는 구조를 만들고 있습니다.\n더 나아가 유튜브 서비스가 활성화 되며 자연스럽게 크리에이터를 돕는 회사나 지원 서비스가 생겨났듯, 앱인토스 파트너사를 돕는 2차 사업자들이 자연스럽게 등장하는 완전한 생태계를 기대하고 있어요. 그때야 비로소 진정한 성장 생태계가 완성되는 거죠.\n현재는 여정의 첫 단계에 불과하지만, 토스는 이 비전을 빠르게 현실로 만들어낼 계획입니다. 기존 글로벌 성공 사례를 비춰보았을 때 성숙한 미니앱 생태계가 구축되는 데 약 5년이 걸렸는데, 토스는 더 빠른 속도로 그 목표를 달성하기 위해 전력으로 노력 중이에요.\n2,900만 유저에게 \n여러분의 서비스를 선보일 준비가 되셨나요?\n현재 앱인토스는 베타 서비스를 통해 다양한 파트너사를 모집하고 있습니다. 게임부터 생활 서비스까지 다양한 분야의 좋은 아이디어가 있다면 누구나 도전할 수 있어요.\n7월 30일에는 앱인토스의 상세한 사업 배경부터 실제 개발 환경까지 상세히 소개하는 앱인토스 웨비나도 개최 예정이니 실무진이 직접 들려주는 생생한 이야기, 절대 놓치지 마시길 바라요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nGraphic 이은호 이제현",

원·달러 환율에 신경 쓸 일이 많지 않았습니다. 하지만 최근 몇 년 사이 미국 주식 투자자가 급격히 늘어나면서 자연스럽게 환율에 관한 관심도 높아졌죠. 환율이 낮을 때 환전하면 수익률 측면에서 유리하기 때문입니다.\n미국 주식과 같이 ‘달러(USD)’로 표시된 금융 자산에 투자하는 것을 달러 자산 투자라고 부릅니다. 그렇다면 왜 달러에 투자할까요? 달러는 글로벌 기축통화✱로, 전 세계적으로 수요가 많은 자산입니다. .css-16cuouw{white-space:pre-wrap;color:var(--adaptiveGrey800);background-color:#3fd59936;}각국의 중앙은행은 국제 결제, 환율 안정, 금융위기 대응을 위해 달러 자산을 보유하고, 기업이나 개인은 무역, 투자, 송금 등의 목적으로 달러 자산이 필요합니다. 즉, 달러는 전 세계에 수요가 있는 기축통화로서 신뢰할 수 있는 투자 대상으로 평가받는 것이죠.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}✱기축통화: 국제 외환 시장에서 금융 거래, 결제, 자산 보유 등의 중심이 되는 통화를 뜻합니다. 대표적으로 미국 달러가 이에 속해요. 더 자세한 내용은 ‘.css-114ityv{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}미국 달러, 어떻게 기축통화가 됐을까?’를 참고하세요.\n달러 자산 투자는 단순히 달러가 저렴할 때 사고 비쌀 때 팔아서 차익을 노리는 환테크뿐 아니라, 미국 주식, 채권, ETF(상장지수펀드), REITs(부동산 투자신탁), 달러 예금 등에 이르는 투자 방식을 포괄합니다.\n달러 자산 투자에 관심 가져야 하는 이유\n큰 수익률을 보이는 특정 종목들 때문에 미국 주식 투자를 시작하는 경우가 많지만, 근본적으로 우리는 왜 달러 자산 투자에 관심을 가질까요? 한마디로 정리하면, 원화 중심으로 구성된 자산 포트폴리오에 달러 자산을 일부 편입함으로써 통화 분산 효과를 얻고 글로벌 투자 기회를 넓힐 수 있기 때문입니다. 이는 한국 자산을 대체한다기보다 보완적 접근이라고 할 수 있죠.\n① 인플레이션과 원화 가치 하락 방어 효과\n요즘 물가가 오르고 있다는 걸 체감하고 계시죠? 마트에서 사는 과일도, 밖에서 사먹는 냉면 한 그릇도 훌쩍 높아진 가격으로 우리를 놀라게 합니다. 이처럼 예전과 같은 물건이나 서비스라도 가격을 더 줘야 하는 현상을 인플레이션이라고 합니다.\n인플레이션이 발생하는 첫 번째 이유는 시중에 돈이 너무 많이 풀렸기 때문입니다. 정부가 침체된 내수 경기를 활성화시키기 위해 돈을 계속 풀면, 그만큼 돈의 가치는 떨어지고 물가는 오르게 돼요. 둘째, 중동의 지정학적 리스크로 유가가 상승한 탓에 전반적으로 물가가 오르고 있습니다. 셋째, 원화 가치가 낮아졌기 때문입니다. 우리나라 경제가 불안해지거나, 정치·외교적인 이슈가 생기면 → 외국 투자자들이 원화를 팔고 빠져나가서 → 환율이 올라가고 → 수입하는 원자재나 물품 가격이 비싸지면서 → 물가도 덩달아 오르게 됩니다.\n이럴 때 달러 자산은 큰 효과를 발휘합니다. 내 자산의 일부를 달러 자산으로 보유하고 있으면 원화 가치가 떨어지더라도 전체 자산의 가치를 방어할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 전 재산을 원화로만 가지고 있는 사람은 인플레이션이 올 때 실질 자산 가치가 줄어들지만, 달러 자산 비중을 일부 확보한 경우 환율 변동이 손실을 일부 상쇄해 줄 가능성이 있으니까요.\n② 글로벌 분산 투자\n한국 경제는 저성장·고령화 등 구조적 변화를 겪고 있는 가운데, 글로벌 교역 환경과 통상 정책 변수에 따라 산업별 기회와 리스크가 동시에 존재합니다. 이런 상황에서 우리가 가진 자산 대부분이 원화로만 묶여 있다면 위험할 수 있습니다. 부동산도 원화 자산이고, 월급도 원화로 받고, 예금도 원화로 넣잖아요. 그런데 만약 원화 가치가 떨어지거나 우리 경제가 위태로운 시기가 오면 우리 자산 전체가 함께 흔들리게 됩니다. \n이럴 때 떠올릴 수 있는 것이 글로벌 분산 투자입니다. ‘달걀을 한 바구니에 담지 말라’는 말처럼 자산을 여러 나라에 투자할 필요가 있습니다. 그중에서도 달러 자산은 미국이라는 가장 큰 경제 시장에 투자할 수 있는 대표적인 방법입니다. 무턱대고 한국 자산을 줄이기보다는 전체 포트폴리오에서 지역·통화 다변화를 고려해 보자는 취지입니다.\n③ 환차익 기대\n원·달러 환율은 오르락내리락을 반복합니다. 긴 흐름으로 보면 달러가 원화보다 강했던 시기가 여러 번 있었고, 그때 ‘환차익’을 얻을 수도 있었습니다. 앞으로도 성장률 차이, 글로벌 자금 이동, 지정학 변수 등에 따라 달러 강세가 나타날 수 있지만, 이는 어디까지나 가능성일 뿐 확정된 미래는 아닙니다.\n여기서 환차익이란, 쉽게 말해 달러 가격이 오를 때 생기는 이익을 말합니다. 예를 들어, 1달러가 1,200원일 때 투자해서 1,400원이 되었을 때 달러를 팔면 200원만큼 환차익을 얻을 수 있으며, 현재 환차익에 대해 세금은 부과되지 않습니다.\n④ 장기적인 자산 증식\n미국 주식 시장은 역사적으로 장기적인 성장 추세를 보여왔습니다. 대공황, 1·2차 세계 대전, 2008년 금융위기, 코로나19 팬데믹 같은 큰 충격이 있어도 이내 회복세를 보였고, 결국엔 더 크게 성장했습니다. 이건 단순한 운이 아니라 미국이라는 나라의 시스템과 기업 생태계에 대한 신뢰가 있기 때문에 가능한 일이었죠. \n실제로 미국 대형주를 대표하는 S&P 500 지수는 지난 수십 년간 연평균 약 7~10%의 수익률을 기록해 왔습니다. 다만 과거 수익률이 미래를 보장하지 않는다는 점, 투자 시점에 따라 수익률이 크게 달라질 수 있다는 점을 유의해야 합니다.\n달러 자산 투자에 대해 궁금한 5가지\nQ1. 언제 사고팔아야 하나요?\n→ 시장은 언제 오르고 내릴지 예측하기 어렵습니다. 따라서 단기적인 가격 변동에 일희일비하기보다는 장기적인 관점에서 꾸준히 투자하는 것이 중요합니다. 만약 비용 평균법✱을 활용해 정기적으로 일정 금액을 투자하면, 환율과 시장의 변동성 리스크를 분산할 수 있습니다. 시장의 타이밍을 맞추려 하기보다는 시장에 지속적으로 참가하는 것이 더 나은 투자 결과로 이어질 가능성이 높습니다.\n✱비용 평균법(Cost Averaging): 일정 금액을 정기적으로 투자해 시장 변동성을 완화하고 평균 매입 단가를 낮추는 전략\nQ2. 초보자는 어떤 달러 자산에 투자하는 게 좋을까요?\n→ 투자자의 위험 선호도와 목표에 따라 선택이 달라집니다. 안정성을 추구한다면 미국 국채나 배당주 ETF(예: SCHD, SPYD, VYM)가 적합합니다. 성장성을 원한다면 기술주 중심의 ETF(예: QQQ)나 개별 주식(예: 엔비디아, 테슬라, 메타 등)에 투자할 수 있습니다. 초보자는 S&P500 지수 ETF(예: VOO, SPY)처럼 시장 전반을 추종하는 상품을 선택하는 것이 더 잘 맞을 수 있고요.\nQ3. 달러의 기축통화 지위가 약화되고 있는 것은 아닌가요?\n→ 중국과 일본이 미국 국채를 매도하고 '탈달러' 움직임을 보이는 등 달러 패권에 대한 의구심이 제기되기도 합니다. 그러나 아직은 달러를 대체할 만큼 신뢰받는 자산이 마땅치 않아 미국의 대체 불가능한 지위는 당분간 유지될 가능성이 높습니다.\nQ4. 달러 자산도 변동성이 높은데 괜찮을까요?\n→ 모든 투자에는 위험이 따릅니다. 원금 보장 상품이 아닌 이상 시장의 변동성은 자연스러운 현상입니다. 중요한 것은 단기적인 변동에 흔들리지 않고 장기적인 성장 가능성을 믿고 투자하는 것이겠죠. 개인 투자자는 분산 투자와 적립식 투자를 통해 리스크를 관리하고 심리적 불안을 줄이는 것이 필요합니다.\nQ5. 미국 주식 투자 시 어떤 비용이 드나요?\n→ 미국 주식에 투자할 때 발생하는 주요 비용은 거래 수수료, 환전 수수료, 그리고 세금 등이 있습니다.\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

또는 달러 RP\n소극적으로 달러 자산 보유를 원한다면 주식 투자보다 달러 예금 또는 달러RP가 잘 맞을 수 있어요.\n\n달러 예금: 말 그대로 달러로 예치하는 예금 상품입니다. 은행에 달러 통장을 만들어 일정 기간 달러를 예치하면 이자를 받을 수 있죠. 안정성이 높고 원금 보장이 된다는 게 가장 큰 특징입니다.\n달러 RP(환매조건부채권): RP는 증권사가 보유한 국공채 등을 담보로 단기적으로 달러를 맡기고 약정한 수익률을 받는 투자 상품입니다. 예금보다는 약간 위험이 따르지만, 금리가 예금보다 높고 짧은 기간 운용이 가능해 자금 회전에 유리합니다. 단, 원금 보장이 되지 않으며 원금 손실 가능성도 존재합니다.\n\n(2) 미국 국채에 투자하기\n미국 국채에 가장 쉽게 투자하는 방법은 증권사 앱의 ‘해외채권’ 메뉴를 이용하는 것입니다. 1년, 2년, 10년 등 원하는 만기와 금리를 확인하고 채권을 매수하면 됩니다. 최근 몇 년간 단기 미국 국채 금리가 국내 단기 예금 대비 경쟁력 있는 수준을 보였던 시기가 있었으나, 금리 수준은 시점에 따라 크게 달라지므로 거래 직전 확인이 필수입니다.\n또 다른 방법으로는 미국 국채 ETF에 투자하는 것이 있습니다. 대표적인 ETF로는 TLT(장기), IEF(중기), SHY(단기) 등이 있죠. 보통 장기채는 금리 변화에 민감해 변동성이 크고, 단기채는 비교적 안정적인 편이기 때문에 자신의 투자 목적과 성향에 맞게 선택하는 것이 중요합니다.\n※ 채권은 만기까지 보유하면 원금과 이자를 받을 수 있지만, 중간에 매도할 경우에는 손실을 볼 수 있으므로 유의해야 합니다.\n달러 자산 투자는 단순한 수익 추구를 넘어 변화무쌍한 글로벌 경제 속에서 나의 자산을 지키고 성장시킬 수 있는 전략적 선택지입니다. 그러니 단기적인 시장 변동에 연연하기보다는 자신에게 맞는 투자 원칙을 세우고 꾸준히 실행하는 것이 중요합니다. 분산 투자와 적립식 투자를 통해 위험을 관리하고, 장기적인 안목으로 시장의 큰 흐름을 읽어 나간다면 분명 달러 자산은 전체 포트폴리오의 보완재 역할을 해줄 것입니다.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 주소은 Graphic 이은호\n해당 콘텐츠는 2025.07.25.

PG 업계에서 RMS를 도입한 사례는 토스페이먼츠가 처음이다.\n토스페이먼츠 RMS는 사전 탐지부터 자동 판단, 사후 조치까지 모든 단계를 하나의 엔진에서 통합 처리하는 모듈형 시스템이다. 매출, 연체 정보 등 다양한 데이터를 종합 분석해 신규 가맹점의 신용과 유동성을 평가하고 산업군별 위험도를 자동으로 등급화한다. 표준화된 정책 기준에 따라 신규 가맹점의 정산 주기와 담보 조건도 자동으로 설정한다.\nRMS는 기존 가맹점에 대해서도 매출, 환불률, 민원율 등 주요 지표를 실시간 모니터링하고 이상 징후 발생 시 자동 알림을 보내 선제적 대응을 가능케 한다. 데이터는 자동 축적돼 심사·모니터링 정책을 지속 고도화하며 전문가 판단이 필요한 고위험 건은 별도 분류하고 심층 분석이 이뤄지도록 했다. 예외 상황(엣지 케이스)에도 유연하게 대응할 수 있는 구조다.\n토스페이먼츠 관계자는 “당사의 리스크 관리 체계는 이미 업계 최고 수준이라는 평가를 받고 있지만 이번 RMS 도입을 통해 이상 거래 발생률을 사실상 0%에 가깝게 낮추는 것이 목표”라며 “데이터 기반의 빠르고 정밀한 리스크 대응 역량을 바탕으로 가맹점과 소비자 모두에게 더욱 안전한 결제 환경을 제공하겠다”고 말했다.",
