        "content:encodedSnippet": "Happy New Year and welcome to the first Java Annotated Monthly of 2026! We hope this year brings fresh ideas, smarter ways to stay productive, and innovation that lasts.\nJAM, as always, is your island of stability in the fast-moving tech world, bringing the coolest news and practical tips. This time, we are starting strong with the amazing Neha Sardana as our featured content guest. Let’s dive in!\nFeatured Content \nNeha Sardana, currently serving as the Vice President and Senior Developer at Morgan Stanley in New York, brings over a decade of experience in the financial services industry across Europe and the US. Apart from her professional commitments, Neha is an active member of the Garden State JUG and NYJavaSIG, where she contributes her expertise in Java technology. As a fervent supporter of open-source software (OSS), she enjoys discussing and writing about everything related to it on her blog.\nHello again, and Happy New Year! I hope you all had a wonderful holiday with your friends and family. I’ve been on parental leave since August with a new baby and a toddler at home –  I have two under three and life is a mess, of course. With all that going on, I’ve still managed to read a bit about something other than AI, since we seem to be talking about it constantly these days.\nRecently, I’ve been digging into Project Valhalla. I keep comparing these features to Scala, which I’ve been using for a while now, and it’s honestly great to see these ideas finally making their way into the Java ecosystem.\nRight now, Java treats almost everything like a heavy object that needs its own “ID card” (identity). Valhalla lets us tell the JVM, “Hey, this is just a piece of data, treat it like a primitive.” It cuts out the memory bloat and makes the cache much happier. Even if you aren’t writing low-level library code, it’s a big deal because the frameworks we use every day are going to get a massive performance boost for free. It’s essentially Java finally admitting that we should be able to write clean code without the “object tax” dragging everything down.\nValhalla has been in the works forever, but with the recent JEP 401 updates, it’s finally starting to feel like a real thing we can use rather than just a research project. Between this and Project Loom, it feels like Java is finally growing up and giving us the tools to write idiomatic code without forcing us to trade performance for readability. Even if you never touch a value class yourself, you’ll feel the impact once the collections and libraries we all rely on start getting swapped out under the hood.\nHere are some links to get started:\nBaeldung: Java Valhalla Project – a clear, developer-friendly explanation \nInside Java – Valhalla articles & talks – deeper technical updates \nValhalla may still be evolving, but understanding what it’s trying to solve today will make the next generation of Java features feel much less surprising when they arrive.\nJava News\nAll the December Java news is here:\nJava News Roundup 1, 2, 3, 4\nAll Features in Java 26 – Inside Java Newscast #102\nJEP targeted to JDK 26: 529: Vector API (11th Incubator)\nJEP 526 Simplifies Deferred Initialization Ahead of JDK 26\nJEP 500: Java to Enforce Strict Final Field Immutability by Restricting Reflection\nSo Long and Thanks for All the Applets\nJEP targeted to JDK 26: 530: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (4th Preview)\nPerformance Improvements in JDK 25\nJava Tutorials and Tips\nDon’t miss these tutorials and tips for peak Java productivity:\nThe best way to replace the deprecated GenericGenerator\nJava, What’s Old?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I always enjoy the quiet stretch between Christmas and New Year’s. It’s one of the few moments in the year when things slow down just enough to reflect on what actually resonated.\nWhile many of us were unplugging, our digital team was doing the opposite, editing and publishing 19 sessions from VS Live! Orlando to the Visual Studio YouTube channel. What surprised me wasn’t just the pace at which those sessions went live, it was what happened next.\nDuring the holidays alone, those sessions were viewed nearly 30,000 times.\nThat tells me two things. First, learning doesn’t stop just because the calendar does. Second, developers are being very intentional about what they choose to spend time on.\n\nWhat’s even more interesting is where that attention went. The most watched Orlando sessions clustered around a few clear themes, and these six titles consistently rose to the top:\nThe Road to Visual Studio 2026: Building a Faster, Smarter IDE\nC# Source Generators, Why They Matter and How to Use Them\nNext-Level Debugging with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio\nAspire, Beyond the Basics\nThe Forgotten Features of Visual Studio You NEED In Your Life!\nFast Focus: Caching Options in .NET\nThese aren’t casual topics. They reflect developers looking for leverage, better tooling, and smarter ways to work as the stack continues to evolve at a rapid pace.\nWhen I step back and look at those sessions together, a clear story emerges, and it’s one worth paying attention to as we head into 2026.\nFrom Watching to Immersion, Where Real Growth Happens\nThere’s real value in learning on your own time. Sitting in a quiet space, pausing a session, trying something locally, rewinding, and revisiting it later all matter. That’s exactly why we publish VS Live! sessions and why so many of you spent time with them over the holidays.\nBut watching is only the first step.\nWhat Orlando reinforced for me is how different the experience becomes when learning turns immersive. When you step away from daily interruptions, your laptop is open, you’re building real things, and the person teaching the session is standing right there answering questions as they come up. When a conversation that starts in a session continues in the hallway, over lunch, or later that evening, until it finally clicks.\nThat’s what developers consistently tell us they value most about the VS Live! events held in Las Vegas NV (March), Redmond WA (July), San Diego CA (Sept) and wrapping up in Orlando FL (Nov).\nIt’s not just the volume of content. It’s the depth. The chance to spend five or six days fully focused on improving how you work, surrounded by people solving the same problems, guided by engineers and practitioners who do this for a living. It’s scenario-based learning, not feature tours. It’s practical guidance you can take straight back to your team.\nThis kind of immersion matters even more now. AI-assisted workflows, modern .NET architectures, cloud-native patterns, and evolving tooling aren’t things most teams can absorb piecemeal. They require time, context, and space to experiment, ask questions, and pressure-test ideas before rolling them out more broadly.\nThat’s the difference between picking up an idea and building confidence. And confidence is what turns learning into action.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImmersion That Changes How You Work\nOne of the reasons VS Live! continues to resonate is the format. This isn’t a conference where you sit back and passively listen all week.\nThe week is intentionally structured to let you immerse yourself in the technology, and just as intentionally, these events are kept small. We cap attendance, often around 500 developers or fewer, on purpose. That size changes everything.\nOn Monday and Friday, we run full-day, instructor-led, hands-on labs. Laptops open. Real code. Real scenarios. You follow along step by step, and when something doesn’t make sense, you don’t wait until later. You raise your hand and ask. The speaker is right there, and the conversation happens in the moment. In a smaller room, that kind of interaction is natural, not intimidating. Many attendees tell us these days alone are worth the trip because they leave with working code and a much deeper understanding of how to apply what they learned back at work.\nTuesday through Thursday shift into a fast-paced mix of deep technical sessions across Visual Studio, .NET, Azure, GitHub, AI-assisted development, cloud-native architecture, data, security, and DevOps. Because sessions aren’t packed wall to wall, it’s easy to engage. Questions get answered. Discussions go deeper. You’re not fighting for attention in a sea of thousands.\nThat smaller scale carries through the entire week. Speakers don’t disappear after their session. They stay. Conversations continue in the hallway, at lunch tables, and during evening events. Many attendees tell us they head home with every question they brought fully answered, something that’s hard to achieve at much larger conferences.\nChoosing Your Immersion, Las Vegas or Redmond\nIn 2026, there are two distinct ways to experience that immersion.\nVS Live! Las Vegas 2026 (March 16–20, 2026)\nLas Vegas is designed to be accessible and high-energy. It’s easy to get to from almost anywhere, which makes it an excellent option for individuals and teams alike. The week combines full-day, hands-on labs on Monday and Friday with deep technical sessions Tuesday through Thursday.\nIt’s an environment built for momentum. You step away from daily delivery pressure, immerse yourself in learning, ask questions in real time, and head home with practical guidance you can put into motion immediately.\nVS Live! at Microsoft HQ 2026 (July 27–31, 2026)\nRedmond offers a different kind of immersion. Being on campus changes the experience in meaningful ways. In addition to the same hands-on labs and deep technical sessions, attendees have opportunities to participate in direct conversations with product managers from many of the Azure services they use every day.\nThere’s also the Meet the Visual Studio PM Team networking event, where you can talk directly with the people who drive features, priorities, and roadmap decisions inside Visual Studio. These conversations go beyond documentation and demos. They provide context, insight, and a clearer understanding of why things work the way they do and where they’re headed next.\nBoth events are built around the same core idea, creating space for developers to fully immerse themselves in the technology, learn directly from experts, and return to work better equipped to lead technical change.\nThis Is the Year to Join Us, and Here’s the Incentive\nThis is the year to experience VS Live! in person. If Las Vegas or Redmond is on your radar, now is the time to plan, secure budget approval, and commit to the experience.\nVisual Studio subscribers unlock exclusive pricing through my.visualstudio.com. Simply sign in with your subscriber ID, navigate to Benefits | Professional Development, and grab the Priority Code from the Visual Studio Live! Events tile to save up to $900 on registration.\nNot a subscriber? No problem.\nAs a reader of the Visual Studio Blog, you can use Priority Code VSLMS at checkout to save up to $600 off registration for VS Live! Las Vegas or VS Live! at Microsoft HQ in Redmond.\nBoth events offer a full week of deep technical learning, hands-on labs on Monday and Friday, and dozens of expert-led sessions Tuesday through Thursday. You’ll also have the opportunity to connect directly with the engineers and product managers behind Visual Studio, .NET, Azure, and GitHub Copilot.\nLas Vegas is easy to get to and ideal for teams looking to immerse themselves in a high-energy learning environment. Redmond offers something uniquely different, direct access to Microsoft product teams, Azure PM conversations, and the opportunity to meet the Visual Studio team on campus.\nWhether you’re a long-time Visual Studio subscriber or just starting to explore GitHub Copilot, AI-assisted development, and modern .NET, this is your chance to spend a week learning deeply, asking real questions, and bringing practical guidance back to your team.\nSee You in 2026\nThe technology we use to build software is evolving faster than ever. Keeping up isn’t about watching more videos, it’s about creating space to learn deeply, ask better questions, and bring proven ideas back to your team.\nVS Live! is designed for exactly that. It’s a week to step away from the noise, immerse yourself in hands-on learning, and spend time with the engineers and product managers who build the tools you rely on every day.\nThis is the year to do it in person.\nOne Orlando attendee summed it up perfectly in the post-conference survey:\n“This is the best conference if you want to learn things you can actually use when you get back to the office.”\nI hope you’ll join us in Las Vegas or Redmond and make 2026 a true growth year, for you and for your team.\n…Jim\nThe post Welcome to 2026, A Growth Year for All of Us appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

지피티팍입니다. 오늘은 정말 흥미로운 구글의 AI 도구, <b>Google Stitch</b>에 대해 이야기해보려고 해요. 이게 뭐냐면, 텍스트 설명이나 간단한 스케치만으로도 전문가 수준의 UI 디자인은 물론, 실제로 작동하는 프론트엔드 코드까지 뚝딱 만들어주는 <b>구글 랩스의 실험적 AI 도구</b>랍니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">핵심 엔진은 구글의 최신 거대 언어 모델인 <b>제미나이(Gemini) 3.0</b>이에요. 기존에는 디자인 한 번 하려면 포토샵이나 피그마 같은 전문 툴로 버튼 하나하나 그리고 색상 선택하고 레이아웃 잡고&hellip; 정말 전문 지식이 많이 필요했잖아요? 그런데 Google Stitch는 그냥 말로만 설명하면 끝이에요. 예를 들어, &ldquo;미니멀한 명상 앱 홈 화면을 만들어줘, 차분한 파스텔 톤으로&rdquo;라고 입력하면 AI가 알아서 레이아웃 구성부터 색상 팔레트, 타이포그래피까지 완성해줍니다. 마치 옆에 전문 디자이너가 앉아있는 것처럼 자연스러운 대화만으로 디자인이 완성되는 거죠. 정말 신기하지 않나요?</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>Google Stitch가 '혁신'인 이유  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">솔직히 처음엔 그냥 예쁜 그림만 만들어주는 줄 알았어요. 그런데 Google Stitch의 진짜 혁신은 바로 여기에 있습니다. 단순히 디자인만 만들어주는 게 아니라, 이 디자인을 <b>실제 사용 가능한 형태로 바로 내보낼 수 있다</b>는 거예요!

        "contentSnippet": "디자인과 코딩을 몰라도 나만의 '수익형 앱'을 만들 수 있다면 어떨까요? 2026년, 구글이 선보인 혁신적인 AI 도구 Google Stitch와 무료 앱 배포 방법을 통해 누구나 앱 주인이 될 수 있는 시대가 열렸습니다. 이 글에서 Google Stitch의 모든 것과 실제 앱 개발 과정을 자세히 알려드릴게요.\n\n\nGoogle Stitch, 도대체 뭘까요?  \n안녕하세요! 지피티팍입니다. 오늘은 정말 흥미로운 구글의 AI 도구, Google Stitch에 대해 이야기해보려고 해요. 이게 뭐냐면, 텍스트 설명이나 간단한 스케치만으로도 전문가 수준의 UI 디자인은 물론, 실제로 작동하는 프론트엔드 코드까지 뚝딱 만들어주는 구글 랩스의 실험적 AI 도구랍니다.\n핵심 엔진은 구글의 최신 거대 언어 모델인 제미나이(Gemini) 3.0이에요. 기존에는 디자인 한 번 하려면 포토샵이나 피그마 같은 전문 툴로 버튼 하나하나 그리고 색상 선택하고 레이아웃 잡고… 정말 전문 지식이 많이 필요했잖아요? 그런데 Google Stitch는 그냥 말로만 설명하면 끝이에요. 예를 들어, “미니멀한 명상 앱 홈 화면을 만들어줘, 차분한 파스텔 톤으로”라고 입력하면 AI가 알아서 레이아웃 구성부터 색상 팔레트, 타이포그래피까지 완성해줍니다. 마치 옆에 전문 디자이너가 앉아있는 것처럼 자연스러운 대화만으로 디자인이 완성되는 거죠. 정말 신기하지 않나요?\nGoogle Stitch가 '혁신'인 이유  \n솔직히 처음엔 그냥 예쁜 그림만 만들어주는 줄 알았어요. 그런데 Google Stitch의 진짜 혁신은 바로 여기에 있습니다. 단순히 디자인만 만들어주는 게 아니라, 이 디자인을 실제 사용 가능한 형태로 바로 내보낼 수 있다는 거예요! 완성된 소스와 이미지 파일들을 ZIP 파일로 다운로드하거나, Google AI Studio나 Jules 같은 코딩 에이전트로 바로 넘겨서 추가 기능을 구현할 수 있죠.\n기존 워크플로우를 생각해보세요. 디자이너가 며칠 걸려 만든 디자인을 개발자에게 넘기면, 개발자가 또 며칠 걸려 코드로 구현했어요. 이 과정에서 디자이너와 개발자 사이에 수많은 소통 비용과 시간 낭비가 발생했죠. 그런데 Google Stitch는 이 모든 간극을 완전히 없애줍니다. 디자인과 코드가 동시에 생성되니까 소통 과정을 80% 이상 줄일 수 있어요. 많은 스타트업들이 아이디어에서 MVP(최소 기능 제품)까지 제작하는 시간을 수주에서 단 몇 시간으로 단축하고 있다고 하니, 정말 놀라운 변화라고 생각해요.\nGoogle Stitch의 핵심 기능 파헤치기  ️\nGoogle Stitch의 핵심 기능은 크게 두 가지로 볼 수 있어요.\n\n\n\n제미나이 3.0 기반의 강력한 AI 엔진\n프로덕션 수준의 코드 생성 기능\n1. 제미나이 3.0 기반의 강력한 AI 엔진\n최근 구글의 AI 모델인 제미나이 3.0으로 업그레이드되면서, Google Stitch는 단순한 디자인 도구를 넘어 '코딩 에이전트'로 완전히 진화했어요. 제미나이 3.0이 특별한 이유는 세 가지입니다.\n네이티브 멀티모달리티: 종이에 대충 그린 스케치를 사진으로 찍어 올려도 AI가 그 의도를 정확히 파악해요. 텍스트와 이미지를 동일한 방식으로 이해해서 마치 사람처럼 “아, 이걸 원하는구나” 하고 파악하는 거죠.\n에이전틱 코딩: 단순히 코드 한 줄을 짜주는 게 아니라, 앱 전체의 구조를 설계하고 오류를 스스로 찾아서 수정합니다. 벤치마크 테스트 결과 이전 모델들보다 코딩 정확도가 35% 이상 높아졌다고 해요.\n100만 토큰의 컨텍스트 윈도우: 수십 개의 화면으로 구성된 앱을 만들 때도 AI가 모든 화면을 기억하고 일관된 디자인 시스템을 유지할 수 있습니다.\n  2026년 현재, Google Stitch는 매월 200~350회의 디자인 생성 크레딧을 제공하고 있어요. 작업할 때 설정 메뉴에서도 크레딧 차감 현황을 확인할 수 있습니다.\n2. 프로덕션 수준의 코드 생성 기능\nGoogle Stitch가 생성하는 코드는 프로덕션(실제 서비스) 수준의 프론트엔드 코드입니다. 실제 서비스에 바로 적용할 수 있을 만큼 깔끔하고 표준을 따르죠. 게다가 반응형 디자인도 자동으로 지원해요. 모바일, 태블릿, 데스크톱 각각의 레이아웃이 미디어 쿼리와 함께 포함되어 출력되기 때문에, 어떤 기기에서든 완벽하게 작동하는 앱을 만들 수 있어요.\n직접 경험해보는 Google Stitch 활용법  \n자, 이제 직접 Google Stitch를 사용해볼 시간입니다! 브라우저를 열고 stitch.withgoogle.com에 접속하세요. 최초 접속 화면에서 '사용해보기'를 클릭해 작업 화면으로 진입할 수 있습니다.\n기본 작업 화면 살펴보기\n앱 종류 선택: 중앙에서 모바일 또는 데스크탑 앱 중 만들 앱을 선택합니다.\n레퍼런스 및 AI 모델: 채팅창 왼쪽에는 레퍼런스(이미지, URL) 제공 버튼이, 우측에서는 작업에 사용할 AI 모델을 선택할 수 있어요.\nRedesign 기능: 'Redesign' 옵션은 기존 웹사이트의 URL이나 스크린샷을 업로드하면 AI가 그 구조를 분석해서 새로운 디자인으로 변경해주는 기능입니다. 나노바나나 모델을 사용한다고 하네요.\n작업 목록: 왼쪽에는 이전 작업 목록이 표시됩니다.\n주요 도구 및 옵션 활용하기\n작업 화면에는 다양한 도구들이 있어요. 제가 중요하다고 생각하는 몇 가지만 짚어드릴게요.\n화면 조작: 화면을 클릭하면 확대되고, 왼쪽 하단에서 축소/확대, 전체 이미지 보기를 할 수 있습니다.\n선택/이동/확대: 화면 중앙의 화살표는 선택 기능, 손 모양은 화면 이동, 돋보기는 지정 구간 확대 기능입니다.\n이미지 추가: 추가한 이미지를 레퍼런스로 사용하여 컬러 톤이나 분위기를 참고해달라고 요청할 때 사용합니다.\n변형 옵션 (미세조정, 보통, 욜로): 작업 화면을 선택하고 '변형'을 클릭하면 디자인 생성 시 결과물의 유사성 및 창의성 범위를 설정할 수 있어요. '욜로(You Only Live Once)'를 선택할수록 가장 급진적이고 창의적인 디자인을 만들어냅니다. 원본과 완전히 다른 컨셉도 가능하죠!\n예측 히트맵: AI를 활용해 사용자들이 페이지의 어느 부분에 시선이 가장 많이 머무를지 예측하는 도구입니다. 중요한 부분에 붉은색이나 노란색으로 표시되어 있어, 사용자의 관심 영역을 한눈에 파악하고 레이아웃을 최적화하는 데 도움이 됩니다.\n재생성: 현재 화면을 새롭게 다시 생성하는 기능이에요. 처음 생성할 때처럼 시간이 좀 걸릴 수 있습니다.\n애노테이트(Annotate): AI STUDIO처럼 디자인 위에 직접 그림을 그리면서 수정 요청을 할 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 계산기 결과값을 지정 후 '노란색으로'라고 입력하고 적용하면 잠시 후 변경됩니다.\n테마 수정: 선택한 화면의 컬러, 모서리 반지름, 글꼴 등을 변경하는 기능입니다.\n프리뷰: 스마트폰이나 태블릿 등 다른 플랫폼에서 앱이 어떻게 보이는지 미리 확인하는 기능이죠.\n실전! 블로그 포스팅 앱 디자인하기\n이제 Google Stitch를 활용해서 사이드바 형태의 블로그 포스팅 앱을 함께 만들어볼까요? 저는 '구글 상위 노출에 최적화된 SEO와 AEO를 모두 만족하는 블로그 글 생성기'를 만들어달라고 요청했어요. 이때 페이지 나누기를 활용하기 위해 폭이 좁은 형태의 앱을 만들어 달라고 강조했습니다.\n첫 화면이 생성되면, 저는 '블로그 주제 선정'과 '글쓰기'를 탭으로 구분하여 주제 선정 기능을 보강해달라고 요청했어요. 이렇게 조금씩 필요한 화면과 디자인을 요청하면서 빌드업하면 나만의 디자인이 완성됩니다. 우측 상단 설정 버튼과 클릭했을 때의 팝업창 디자인까지 요청하면 완벽하겠죠?\n나만의 앱 만들기: AI Studio 연동 & 배포 과정  \n디자인이 완성되었다면 이제 실제 앱으로 만들어야겠죠? Google Stitch는 완성된 디자인을 Google AI Studio로 바로 내보낼 수 있는 강력한 기능을 제공합니다.\n내보내기: 'More' 메뉴에서 '코드 보기'를 통해 선택된 화면의 앱 소스를 볼 수 있어요. '내보내기'를 클릭하면 작업한 화면 스크린샷과 소스를 AI Studio, Jules로 내보내거나 ZIP 파일로 다운로드할 수 있습니다.\nAI Studio로 빌드: 내보내기할 화면을 모두 선택한 후 'AI Studio'에 체크하고 설명란에 '폭이 좁은 앱'임을 다시 강조합니다. 그리고 하단의 'AI STUDIO로 빌드' 버튼을 클릭하세요.\n이러면 선택한 화면들의 디자인과 소스가 AI Studio로 넘어갑니다. AI Studio에서 바로 '빌드'를 클릭하면, 잠시 후 첨부한 디자인을 참고하여 앱이 생성돼요. 우리는 이제 익숙한 AI Studio에서 지금까지 배우신 방법으로 조금씩 빌드업해서 나만의 앱을 완성해 가면 됩니다. 정말 간편하죠?\n\n\n생성된 앱 활용 및 블로그 글 작성\n웨일이나 크롬 브라우저에서 화면을 나누거나 창을 두 개 열고, 멤버십 게시물에 있는 링크로 앱을 실행합니다. 우측 상단에 설정 버튼을 클릭하고 API 키와 몇 가지 설정을 저장하면, '주제 탐색' 탭에서 최신 이슈와 트렌드를 검색하여 다양한 카테고리의 주제를 제안해 줍니다.\n저는 자동차 카테고리에서 주제 하나를 선택해봤어요. 그러면 바로 '글쓰기' 탭으로 이동합니다. 여기서 글쓰기 톤과, 사람이 쓴 글처럼 보이게 하는 두 가지 유형 중 하나를 선택하고 컬러 테마를 선택한 다음, '자동 기사 생성'을 클릭합니다.\n잠시 후 기사가 완성되면, 먼저 블로그 제목과 하단에 있는 키워드를 복사해서 붙여넣으세요. 그다음 본문 내 이미지는 직접 생성하거나 API 비용이 걱정된다면 눈동자 아이콘을 클릭하여 보이는 프롬프트를 활용해 제미나이에서 무료로 이미지를 생성할 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ 주의사항: 블로그에 기사 본문을 추가하기 위해 'HTML 복사'를 클릭할 때, 생성된 이미지를 함께 추가할 수 있지만 베이스64(Base64) 방식으로 생성된 이미지인 만큼 주의사항을 읽어보고 결정하는 것이 중요해요. 베이스64 방식은 화면처럼 엄청난 양의 코드로 이미지를 구현하기 때문에, 웹페이지 로딩 속도나 용량 측면에서 단점이 있을 수 있거든요. 이미지 제외하고 코드를 복사하면 이미지 추가할 위치가 표시되니, 그 자리에 이미지를 추가하고 알트 태그도 이미지 정보에서 복사해서 붙여넣는 것을 추천합니다!\n  핵심 요약\n1.

Google Stitch는 프로덕션 수준의 프론트엔드 코드를 생성하며, 이를 Google AI Studio와 연동하여 실제 작동하는 앱으로 완성할 수 있습니다. 이후 앱 마켓을 통해 배포하고 다양한 방법으로 수익을 창출할 수 있습니다.\nQ3: Gemini 3.0의 '네이티브 멀티모달리티'가 Google Stitch 사용에 어떤 이점을 주나요?\nA3: 네이티브 멀티모달리티는 텍스트뿐만 아니라 스케치나 이미지를 통해서도 AI가 사용자의 의도를 정확히 파악하게 해줍니다. 이는 더욱 자유롭고 창의적인 방식으로 디자인을 요청하고 수정할 수 있게 하여, 아이디어를 시각화하는 과정을 훨씬 효율적으로 만들어줍니다.\nQ4: Google Stitch 사용 시 주의해야 할 점이 있나요?\nA4: 생성된 HTML 코드에 이미지가 베이스64(Base64) 방식으로 포함될 경우, 파일 용량이 커지고 웹페이지 로딩 속도가 느려질 수 있습니다. 따라서 이미지 관련 코드는 주의해서 사용하시거나, 이미지를 별도로 업로드하고 이미지 URL과 알트 태그를 수동으로 추가하는 것을 권장합니다.\nEdge BLOG Write Basic 다운로드  \n아래 링크를 클릭하세요, Edge BLOG Write Basic 사용은 무료지만.. gemini api 키는 여러분걸로 하셔야합니다.\n\n \nSEO Writer AI\n \nedge-blog-write-basic.vercel.app",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 2012년도부터 평균적으로 매달 한두 개의 신규 투자를 집행하고 있다. 그리고 이렇게 투자하기 위해서 몇 년 전부터 해마다 1,500개 이상의 스타트업을 검토하고 있다. 아직 작년의 통계가 나오지 않았지만, 아마도 2025년에도 1,500개 이상의 스타트업을 검토한 것 같다. 1,500개 회사를 모두 다 대면 미팅하는 건 아니다. 어떤 회사는 그냥 자료만 보고 패스하는 경우도 있는데, 기본적으로 스트롱은 대면 미팅을 국내 그 어떤 VC보다 더 많이 할 것이다. 나를 포함해서 우리 투자팀에는 6명의 심사역이 있는데 – 내 공식 직책은 대표 또는 파트너지만 회사를 만나서 검토할 땐 나도 그냥 심사역이다 – 우리는 매일 평균 5개~8개 정도의 미팅을 소화하지 않을까 싶다.\n작년 12월은 이런 미팅을 하느라 참 바빴다. 하루는 내가 5개의 미팅을 했는데, 이 5개 모두 매우 복잡해서 이해하기가 쉽지 않은 사업이었다. 미팅의 효율을 극대화하기 위해서 사전에 자료는 충분히 숙지하고, 되도록 사전 질문도 다 적어서 미팅에 임해야 하는데, 솔직히 이렇게 매일 미팅이 너무 많은 시기에는 사업 자료만 대충 보고 참석한다. 실은 이날은 5개 스타트업의 자료도 꽤 깊게 보고 미팅에 참여했고, 미팅 시간에도 초집중했는데, 복잡한 사업이라서 그런지 이렇게 해도 사업 내용과 비즈니스 모델을 100% 다 이해하진 못했다. 그리고 이렇게 초집중해서 공부하고 미팅하느라 잘 안 돌아가는 뇌를 많이 써서 그런지, 그날 집에 오니까 하루 종일 중노동을 한 것처럼 에너지가 방전됐다. 힘든 12월이었다.\n그런데 생각해 보면, 이 5개의 미팅을 하기 위해서 나는 내가 전혀 모르거나, 잘 모르는 분야에 대해서 열심히 공부도 하고 자료도 찾아보면서, 나름 이 분야에 대한 지식이 생겼는데, 이렇게 단시간 안에 배움을 압축했다는 사실에 스스로 매우 뿌듯했다. VC가 아니었다면 절대로 관심조차 두지 않았을 분야에 대해서 스스로 공부하고, 미팅을 통해서 5년 이상 이 분야에서 습득한 경험, 지식, 노하우, 그리고 영업비밀을 다른 창업가들을 통해서 1시간 반 만에 가만히 앉아서 배울 수 있는 이런 배움의 압축을 경험할 수 있는 직업을 가진 게 고마웠다. 그것도 이런 배움의 압축을 나는 1년 365일 매일 경험할 수 있다는 사실을 그동안 잊고 지냈는데, 이날 다시 한번 스스로에게 내가 얼마나 재미있고 의미 있는 직업을 가졌는지에 대해서 상기시킬 수 있었다.\n물론, 모든 사업이 신기하고 모든 창업가와의 미팅이 보람찬 건 아니다. 어떤 미팅은 아주 좋고, 어떤 미팅은 아주 별로이고, 어떤 미팅은 실제 투자로 이어지지만, 대부분의 미팅은 투자로 이어지지 않는다. 하지만, 지금까지 창업가들과의 만남 중 완전히 쓸모없는 미팅은 그렇게 많지 않았다. 모든 미팅은 배울 게 있고, 완전 시간 낭비라고 생각했던 창업가와의 미팅도 낙관적으로 생각해 보면 다시는 이런 분들과 대면 미팅하면 안 되겠다는 배움을 얻을 수 있는 쓸모 있는 미팅이다.\nVC가 아니더라도 항상 배울 수 있는 직업은 이 세상에 매우 많다. 뭐를 하든 학습하는 자세만 있다면 배움을 얻을 수 있다. 하지만, 엄청난 배움을 단시간 안에 압축해서 얻을 수 있는 직업은 그렇게 많지 않다. 내가 이 VC라는 직업에 대해 자주 강조하는 점은, 이 일은 끝없이 듣고, 끝없이 생각하고, 끝없이 질문하는 건데, 이건 마치 학교에서 공부하고 강의를 듣는 학생이라는 직업과 크게 다르지 않다는 것이다. 오히려 학교에서 얻는 배움보다 훨씬 더 압축됐고, 모든 지식이 생생하게 살아있고, 대부분 인생에 큰 도움이 되는 배움이라서 VC는 어떻게 보면 세상에서 가장 압축된 배움을 가장 빨리 습득할 수 있는, 가장 큰 학교에 다니는 학생이라고 할 수 있다. 그리고 스스로 생각도 하고, 질문도 하고, 공부도 해야 하지만, 결국엔 시간 내서 우리를 찾아오는 창업가라는 현장의 선생님에게 무료로 수업을 들을 수 있는 꽤 편리한 직업이다. \n나는 일주일에 책을 한 권 정도 읽는데, 독서도 작가의 50년 경험과 노하우를 4시간 만에 습득할 수 있는 압축적 배움의 대명사이다. 창업가와의 미팅과 독서를 병행하면, 정말 많은 걸 압축적으로 배울 수 있다.",
