There were no tool changes as of the date of the registry release in August, though more changes will be listed in the next release in September.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,666 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n14 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n240 ports were updated. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n86 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,000 forks and 25,500 stars on GitHub.\nGitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg\nEarlier this month, we announced GitHub Dependabot support for vcpkg. This allows GitHub users to receive automated PRs to upgrade their vcpkg versioning baselines. Since that announcement, the automated PRs have been updated to include information about the vcpkg release being upgraded to, including port counts per triplet, as well as a list of impacted ports and their original vs. new versions. Here is an example of one of the new PRs.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.08.27 release)\nNo tool updates as of 2025.08.27. More tool updates will be included in next month’s release.\nDocumentation changes\nAdded documentation covering Dependabot support for vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#512, thanks @JamieMagee!).\nOther minor documentation fixes.\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2453\n\n\nx64-windows\n2575\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2575\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2450\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2507\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1452\n\n\narm64-windows\n2181\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2163\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1421\n\n\nx64-osx\n2446\n\n\narm64-osx\n2376\n\n\nx64-linux\n2568\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1998\n\n\nx64-android\n2059\n\n\narm64-android\n2021\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing how Meta is applying machine learning (ML) and diversity algorithms to improve notification quality and user experience. \nWe’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework to reduce uniformity and deliver a more varied and engaging mix of notifications.\nThis new framework reduces the volume of notifications and drives higher engagement rates through more diverse outreach.\nNotifications are one of the most powerful tools for bringing people back to Instagram and enhancing engagement. Whether it’s a friend liking your photo, another close friend posting a story, or a suggestion for a reel you might enjoy, notifications help surface moments that matter in real time.\nInstagram leverages machine learning (ML) models to decide who should get a notification, when to send it, and what content to include. These models are trained to optimize for user positive engagement such as click-through-rate (CTR) – the probability of a user clicking a notification – as well as other metrics like time spent.\nHowever, while engagement-optimized models are effective at driving interactions, there’s a risk that they might overprioritize the product types and authors someone has previously engaged with. This can lead to overexposure to the same creators or the same product types while overlooking other valuable and diverse experiences. \nThis means people could miss out on content that would give them a more balanced, satisfying, and enriched experience. Over time, this can make notifications feel spammy and increase the likelihood that people will disable them altogether. \nThe real challenge lies in finding the right balance: How can we introduce meaningful diversity into the notification experience without sacrificing the personalization and relevance people on Instagram have come to expect?\nTo tackle this, we’ve introduced a diversity-aware notification ranking framework that helps deliver more diverse, better curated, and less repetitive notifications. This framework has significantly reduced daily notification volume while improving CTR. It also introduces several benefits:\nThe extensibility of incorporating customized soft penalty (demotion) logic for each dimension, enabling more adaptive and sophisticated diversity strategies.\nThe flexibility of tuning demotion strength across dimensions like content, author, and product type via adjustable weights.\nThe integration of balancing personalization and diversity, ensuring notifications remain both relevant and varied.\nThe Risks of Notifications without Diversity\nThe issue of overexposure in notifications often shows up in two major ways:\nOverexposure to the same author: People might receive notifications that are mostly about the same friend. For example, if someone often interacts with content from a particular friend, the system may continue surfacing notifications from that person alone – ignoring other friends they also engage with. This can feel repetitive and one-dimensional, reducing the overall value of notifications.\nOverexposure to the same product surface: People might mostly receive notifications from the same product surface such as Stories, even when Feed or Reels could provide value. For example, someone may be interested in both reel and story notifications but has recently interacted more often with stories. Because the system heavily prioritizes past engagement, it sends only story notifications, overlooking the person’s broader interests. \nIntroducing Instagram’s Diversity-Aware Notification Ranking Framework\nInstagram’s diversity-aware notification ranking framework is designed to enhance the notification experience by balancing the predicted potential for user engagement with the need for content diversity. This framework introduces a diversity layer on top of the existing engagement ML models, applying multiplicative penalties to the candidate scores generated by these models, as figure1, below, shows.\nThe diversity layer evaluates each notification candidate’s similarity to recently sent notifications across multiple dimensions such as content, author, notification type, and product surface. It then applies carefully calibrated penalties—expressed as multiplicative demotion factors—to downrank candidates that are too similar or repetitive. The adjusted scores are used to re-rank the candidates, enabling the system to select notifications that maintain high engagement potential while introducing meaningful diversity. In the end, the quality bar selects the top-ranked candidate that passes both the ranking and diversity criteria.\nFigure.1: Instagram’s diversity-aware ranking framework where the diversity layer sits on top of the existing modeling layer and penalizes notifications that are too similar to recently sent ones.\nMathematical Formulation \nWithin the diversity layer, we apply a multiplicative demotion factor to the base relevance score of each candidate. Given a notification candidate 𝑐, we compute its final score as the product of its base ranking score and a diversity demotion multiplier:\n\n\nwhere R(c) represents the candidate’s base relevance score, and D(c) ∈ [0,1] is a penalty factor that reduces the score based on similarity to recently sent notifications. We define a set of semantic dimensions (e.g., author, product type) along which we want to promote diversity. For each dimension i, we compute a similarity signal pi(c) between candidate c and the set of historical notifications H, using a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) approach:\n\nwhere simi(·,·) is a predefined similarity function for dimension i. In our baseline implementation, pi(c) is binary: it equals 1 if the similarity exceeds a threshold 𝜏i and 0 otherwise. \nThe final demotion multiplier is defined as: \n\n\nwhere each wi  ∈ [0,1] controls the strength of demotion for its respective dimension. This formulation ensures that candidates similar to previously delivered notifications along one or more dimensions are proportionally down-weighted, reducing redundancy and promoting content variation. The use of a multiplicative penalty allows for flexible control across multiple dimensions, while still preserving high-relevance candidates.\nThe Future of Diversity-Aware Ranking\nAs we continue evolving our notification diversity-aware ranking system, a next step is to introduce more adaptive, dynamic demotion strategies. Instead of relying on static rules, we plan to make demotion strength responsive to notification volume and delivery timing. For example, as a user receives more notifications—especially of similar type or in rapid succession—the system progressively applies stronger penalties to new notification candidates, effectively mitigating overwhelming experiences caused by high notification volume or tightly spaced deliveries.\nLonger term, we see an opportunity to bring large language models (LLMs) into the diversity pipeline. LLMs can help us go beyond surface-level rules by understanding semantic similarity between messages and rephrasing content in more varied, user-friendly ways. This would allow us to personalize notification experiences with richer language and improved relevance while maintaining diversity across topics, tone, and timing.\nThe post A New Ranking Framework for Better Notification Quality on Instagram appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Note: This is a guest post from John Arundel, a Go writer and teacher who blogs at bitfieldconsulting.com. His most recent book is The Deeper Love of Go.\nHow do you break it to someone that they’ve wasted most of their life? Well, I worked with a guy who didn’t know how to copy and paste. Every time he wanted to move some code, he’d delete it and then grimly re-type the whole thing somewhere else, as I watched in silent dismay: “How do I tell him?”\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t want to be able to copy and paste. He just had no idea that he could – he’d never taken the time to fiddle around and find out.\nThat guy is all of us, in a way. Even if we can copy and paste, what other editor superpowers are we missing out on? And how much time are we wasting by not knowing about them? I’m just going to confidently say “Some”, right?\nA modern IDE is more than just a text editor – it’s also a file manager, debugger, linter, AI assistant, and so on. Even better, an IDE like GoLand actually understands Go, so it can make suggestions as you type, highlight errors, annotate your code, and refactor automatically.\nHere are ten things you might not know GoLand can do, and each one will make you more productive as a Go developer.\nSearch everywhere\n90% of software engineering is just finding stuff, I reckon: where is that function defined? Where did I put that struct type?\nDouble-tap the Shift key in GoLand and type to search everywhere”: definitions, symbols, filenames, or even editor features. For example, enter search to see all search-related settings.\n\n\n\n\nGo to implementation\nCmd-click a function or variable name and GoLand will take you straight to its definition, even in another package or file (or even the standard library or your dependencies). And you can keep drilling down further until you find what you need, then use Cmd-[ to jump back.\n\n\n\n\nStructure view\nFor a high-level overview of your constants, functions, types, and their associated methods, press Cmd-F12 to open the Structure view of your file or package. Click on any item to go to its definition.\n\n\n\n\nParameter names\nGoLand shows inline hints for function calls, giving parameter names for each function argument. This makes reading code easier, especially when arguments are nil, for example. You’ll also see name hints for results in a return statement, and field names for struct literals that omit them.\n\n\n\n\nErrors and warnings\nSure, GoLand can point out compile errors – an angry red underline indicates the offending code, and you can hover the mouse over it to see what’s wrong (or use the Inspection Lens plugin to see all errors inline without hovering). Saved you a compile-edit-fix cycle.\nThat’s great, but GoLand will also warn you about probable mistakes: unreachable code, unhandled errors, unused functions, redundant type conversions, or variable names that shadow the name of a package. Even though they’re technically legal (the best kind of legal), they’re likely not what you meant, and GoLand will pick these up and offer to auto-fix them.\n\n\n\n\nNil pointer analysis\nAh, pointers! The cause of – and solution to – all programming problems. Specifically, pointers can be nil (meaning “doesn’t point to any value”). That’s a problem if you try to dereference such a pointer (that is, ask Go to give you the value it points to), and by “problem” I mean “horrible crash”.\nBut how can you tell whether a pointer will be nil at run time without running the program? Only by understanding the complete history of that variable throughout the code. Unfortunately, even GoLand isn’t yet smart enough to *touches earpiece* and I’m being told that in fact GoLand is now smart enough to do that.\nThe experimental data flow analysis feature simulates the execution of your program to catch run-time errors like nil pointers even before you run it. That’s something I’ve never seen before in an IDE, and it’s pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nCompletions and templates\nYou’d expect GoLand to offer inline completions of function and variable names and so on, but that’s table stakes. Even more powerful are live templates: parameterized code snippets you can insert and complete interactively.\nFor example, if you want to write a for ... range loop, type for, and select For range loop from the picklist (or type forr and press Tab). You’ll get a skeleton for loop with placeholders for you to fill in the loop variables and body.\nSimilarly, if you get bored typing if err != nil... repeatedly (but how could anyone find that boring?) GoLand can fill in the error-handling block for you, if you ask nicely.\nLive templates automate dozens of the most common Go patterns and idioms, and you can create your own, with placeholders like $INDEX$ for parameters you want users to fill in.\nAlso, if you have a blob of JSON data that you need to turn into a Go type, just paste it into the editor. GoLand will offer to generate the struct definition for you automatically, complete with json tags to make it parseable.\n\n\n\n\nRefactoring\nDo you ever wish you’d named your child something different? It might be a bit late to revisit that one, but fortunately it’s always possible to rename things in your Go programs, like functions and variables.\nManually retyping them everywhere would be annoying, and normal search-and-replace is error-prone (the Scunthorpe problem). GoLand is smarter about this because it understands Go: it knows if a word is a variable or function name, and avoids replacing it if it’s in some other context like inside a string or a comment.\nAlso, you can edit a function’s signature, adding or removing parameters as you like, and GoLand will automatically change the calls to that function everywhere.\nOr try this one weird tip to slim down your chubby functions, and make your code beach body ready: select some lines and use Extract method to replace them with a call to a method that does the same thing. By eliminating paperwork, you make the program more readable and focus on what’s actually relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nNow, I’m not saying you ever write bugs – perish the thought. Shall we say rather that programs occasionally don’t behave exactly the way we expect them to? Figuring out just where and why things are going wrong can be difficult, unless you can shrink down to the size of an electron and go inside the computer to see what’s happening (I’m still waiting on that Kickstarter).\nFailing this, though, GoLand’s debugger is a pretty acceptable substitute. For example, set a breakpoint on a suspicious line and the debugger will stop the program there, keeping all variables intact so that you can inspect them (or edit them). Breakpoints can be conditional, too, so you only stop if a certain expression is true.\nThen, if the problem still isn’t clear, you can Step Over to continue executing the code line by line, or Step Into to follow function calls down the rabbit hole.\nTo get really inside baseball, you can set a watch on the variables you’re interested in, or even arbitrary Go expressions, and see their values change as the program runs.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains AI tools\nYou were expecting this, right? Everything has AI now (or as I like to say, “Everything’s computer”). GoLand’s optional AI Assistant plugin is there, not to supplant your wonderfully human intelligence, but to support it.\nFor example, you can highlight some code and ask the assistant to explain it,  suggest refactorings, or generate tests. You can ask it questions about the language or the standard library – all those “at this point I’m afraid to ask” things, and it won’t judge you.\nNaturally, you can also use Junie, the JetBrains AI coding agent, as part of GoLand. You can ask Junie to write whole packages or programs for you, or to read a bunch of user requirements and sketch out a system design, then implement it.\nIf there’s some project you’ve always wanted to write, but you aren’t sure how to get started, collaborating with Junie could get you unblocked. Think of Junie as a pair programmer who doesn’t get bored or lose focus, and who can help you out with program structure and algorithms while still letting you have the fun of writing the interesting parts yourself.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more\nWhat’s that? Ten superpowers aren’t enough for you? You’ve got some attitude, mister. Look, GoLand can do more than we’ve had time to cover here – a lot more. But these ten things are a great place to start. Once you’ve mastered them, feel free to explore: read the docs, click around, try stuff out.\nDon’t be like my non-copy-pasting friend, always too busy cutting wood to stop and sharpen the saw. A few minutes a day invested in really learning your IDE is time well spent. Pretty soon, these superpowers will become part of your muscle memory, just like copy and paste. (GoLand has that too. You’re welcome.)",

Think of it as a USB-C port for AI: a consistent way to plug the AI models your AI agent uses into specific tools and data sources. \nYou can connect Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, to a wide variety of officially provided or community-built MCP servers, or build your own MCP server using one of the available SDKs – including the brand-new MCP PHP SDK.\nAbout the MCP PHP SDK\nMCP SDKs are lightweight frameworks that handle the protocol details so that developers can focus on the application functionality that AI agents will use.\nThe MCP PHP SDK is an official MCP SDK built as a joint effort by the PHP Foundation, Anthropic’s MCP team, and Symfony. The goal of the project is to provide a framework-agnostic, production-ready reference implementation that the PHP ecosystem can rely on. For details about using MCP PHP SDK or contributing to it, see modelcontextprotocol/php-sdk.\nJunie and the MCP\nWhether you are building your own MCP server or using an existing one, here’s how to make it work with the Junie AI coding agent in PhpStorm:\nMake sure that the MCP server can be accessed and started. \nThe specific method for starting an MCP server depends on the server’s implementation – please refer to the MCP server’s documentation for instructions.\n\n\n\n\nConfigure Junie in PhpStorm to connect. \nTo add the MCP server to Junie, press ⇧Shift twice to open the search window and search for “MCP Settings”. On the MCP Settings page, you can see the list of connected servers and add or edit JSON configurations for the MCP servers in the ~/.junie/mcp.json file.\n\nTo configure an MCP server at the project level, manually add an mcp.json file with your desired server configurations to the .junie/mcp folder in the project root.\nTo view the list of actions that Junie can perform through a configured MCP server, locate the server in the MCP Settings list and expand the Status drop-down.\n\nFor example, with the Laravel Boost MCP server, Junie gets useful tools for working with Laravel projects, such as listing Artisan commands, routes, or config files, reading logs, querying databases, or searching versioned documentation.\nThis is where the MCP shines: It bridges the gap between LLMs and dynamic, framework- and project-specific context and data.\n\n\n\n\nBenefit from improved context when using Junie. \nWhen running a prompt, Junie analyzes what commands registered with the configured MCP servers are relevant and executes them through the respective MCP server.\n\nThe Junie coding agent keeps evolving. Join the conversation in our Junie Discord community and help shape what’s next for Junie.\nA new chapter for MCP servers in PHP\nWhile you could use any SDK implementation to create MCP servers for PHP projects, the official MCP PHP SDK boosts the contribution of the PHP community into the AI ecosystem, both within the PHP realm and beyond.\nThe MCP PHP SDK maintainers encourage PHP developers to submit their MCP integrations for PHP frameworks and tools – Laravel, Symfony, WordPress, custom APIs, and more – to be listed in the SDK’s GitHub repo.",

We’ve also got a featured section by Marit van Dijk, covering the new Java 25 release, the latest IntelliJ IDEA updates, and a playful take on learning modern Java.\nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nMarit van Dijk\nMarit van Dijk is a software developer, Java Champion and Developer Advocate at JetBrains. She has over 20 years of diverse experience across various roles and companies, and is passionate about building awesome software in collaboration with amazing people, and making developers’ lives better. She is a frequent speaker at international conferences, writes blog posts and tutorials, creates videos, and is a contributor to the book “97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know” (O’Reilly Media).\nWelcome to Java Annotated Monthly for September. For the folks in Europe / the Northern hemisphere, I hope that you have had a great summer and were able to disconnect from work.\nThis month, I’m excited for the start of the conference season with my first talk at JavaZone and, of course, the release of Java 25 on September 16, 2025. This release comes with some nice changes to the language: Compact Source Files and Instance Main Methods and Module Import Declarations make it easier to get started with Java, Flexible Constructor Bodies allow statements in a constructor before calling super(), so you can validate your data before constructing objects, and Scoped Values make managing thread-local data more convenient, safe, and scalable. This feature will be even more useful with Structured Concurrency (still in preview). In addition, there are improvements in performance and performance insights, as well as several other changes. We will write a blog post with more details later this month.\nJava 25 support was introduced in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2, with additional support added in 2025.2.1. IntelliJ IDEA already introduced support for Java 25 in 2025.2, and additional support was added in 2025.2.1. In case you missed it, check out the What’s New in IntelliJ IDEA 2025.2 stream, where we show you Java 25 support, Virtual Threads Debugger, Spring Debugger and Spring Modulith support, support for Maven 4 (which may also be released soon), and a sneak peek of a new feature we are working on!\nJava 25 will be an “LTS” version. Or is it? If you are updating from Java 21, watch this great video by Nikolai Parlog on How to Upgrade to Java 25, showing you some of the problems you might encounter when upgrading and how to solve them, the overview of All New Java Language Features Since Java 21 by José Paumard, and other videos in the series.\nIn Learning Modern Java the Playful Way, fellow Java Champion Piotr Przybył and I show you how to upgrade your code using live demos (and silly jokes). You can catch a slightly updated version of this talk at several conferences this Fall/Autumn. To find out where I’ll be, check my website.

        "title": "5 Ways Static Code Analysis Can Improve Developer Experience",
        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/qodana/2025/09/improve-developer-experience/",
        "pubDate": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 18:28:03 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Improve developer experience with static code analysis. \n\n\n\nDeveloper experience is not only about nice editors and fast build times. It is about reducing friction so developers can focus on solving problems rather than fighting with tools. Among the most effective developer experience tools available today is static code analysis. By examining code without running it, static analysis surfaces potential issues early and helps teams deliver higher-quality software, faster.\nResearch from Stack Overflow’s 2025 survey showed that “Public search engines are the top resource used by professional developers to find answers to technical questions. 55% use traditional search and 15% use AI-powered search, either free or paid”. But what if the tools we work in to improve code quality and security to help provide those answers with in-context learning? \nThis is just one of the ways that static code analysis can significantly improve developer experience.  The same research found that developers had high levels of frustration with technical debt, tech stack complexity and the reliability of the tools they use – all of which we’ve taken into account when developing Qodana’s roadmap.  \n\n\n\n\nThis research, as well as anecdotal sharing and common research findings, shows that developers have a lot of frustration in their daily workflows, so how else can static code analysis help? Today, we’re highlighting 5 ways: \n1. Faster feedback loops\nWaiting for a build to complete or a test suite to run slows momentum. Static code analysis integrates directly into the development environment or CI pipeline, providing almost immediate insights into potential bugs, style violations, or security vulnerabilities. \nInstead of context switching between writing code and waiting for feedback, developers can fix problems as they code. Faster feedback loops shorten the distance between writing and validating, which keeps developers in the flow.\n2. Reduced cognitive load\nModern systems are complex, and keeping all the rules, patterns, and security practices in mind while coding is unrealistic. Static code analysis acts as a safety net, catching violations of coding standards, identifying unsafe constructs, and reminding developers of best practices. \nThis reduces the mental overhead of remembering every guideline and allows developers to concentrate on design and problem solving. Over time, this makes coding less stressful and improves overall team productivity.\n3. Improved code quality and consistency\nTeams often struggle with inconsistent coding styles or subtle bugs that slip into production. Static code analysis enforces coding standards across the project, ensuring consistency and readability. \nIt can detect common error patterns like null pointer dereferences, uninitialized variables, or unused imports before they cause real issues. By automatically highlighting these concerns, static analysis tools improve the reliability of the codebase and build long term maintainability.\n4. Time savings across the lifecycle\nFixing a defect after release is many times more expensive than resolving it during development. Static code analysis catches problems at the earliest stage, reducing the need for long QA cycles or emergency hotfixes – and Qodana has quick fixes. \nIt also helps reviewers by pre-filtering trivial issues, so code reviews can focus on architecture and logic instead of formatting or lint-level concerns. Developers spend less time on rework and more time on meaningful progress.\nIn some cases, like with Qodana, capability extends beyond simple analysis with checks for security vulnerabilities, license incompatibilities and malicious injections. These massively contribute to compliance issues and time spent when they aren’t detected out the gate, so detection saves time and legal issues. \n5. Integration with modern developer experience tools\nStatic code analysis is most effective when combined with other developer experience tools. For example, integrating analysis with CI/CD pipelines creates automated quality gates that block unsafe or noncompliant code before it reaches production. \nConnecting with IDEs provides inline feedback during coding sessions. Qodana can even align findings with compliance standards, making it easier for enterprises to ensure both quality and security.\n\n\n\n\nStatic code analysis is more than a safety net to catch errors. It can genuinely improve developer experience. By offering faster feedback, reducing cognitive load, improving code quality, saving time, and integrating with the wider developer toolchain, it helps teams deliver better software with less friction. \nFor organizations that want to support their developers, adopting static code analysis is an essential step toward a healthier and more productive workflow.\nContribute to better developer experiences in your organization\nIf you want to improve developer experience and remove obstacles, you can support the teams in your organization with a reliable code quality and security tool. \nTry Qodana",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Many developers have run into subtle issues with annotations when working with Kotlin and frameworks like Spring or JPA-based persistence frameworks. For instance, an annotation applied to a constructor parameter might not always end up in the property or backing field where the framework expects it.\nThis often means annotations don’t land where they’re needed. For example, bean validation checks might only happen when the object was first created, but not when its properties were later updated. The result? Confusing bugs, surprising runtime behavior, and sometimes even the need to dig into bytecode to see what’s really going on. For example, validation might not be enforced when entities are loaded or updated from the database.\nWith Kotlin 2.2, we’re addressing this problem. A new default rule makes annotations land where developers expect them to, reducing boilerplate and aligning better with popular frameworks.\nConsider this simple JPA entity:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @NotBlank\n    var name: String,\n\n    @Email\n    var email: String\n)\nAt first glance this looks correct. But in Kotlin versions before 2.2, the default rule applied these annotations only to the constructor parameter (@param).\nIf we look at the decompiled code, it actually becomes:\npublic class Order {\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  private final long id;\n\n  @NotNull\n  private String name;\n\n  @NotNull\n  private String email;\n\n  public Order(long id, @NotBlank @NotNull String name, @Email @NotNull String email) {\n      Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(name, \"name\");\n      Intrinsics.checkNotNullParameter(email, \"email\");\n      super();\n      this.id = id;\n      this.name = name;\n      this.email = email;\n   }\n…\n}\nValidation annotations like @NotBlank and @Email weren’t placed on the field/property – they only validated object construction, not property updates.\nThis mismatch has been a common source of confusion.\nPrevious workaround: Explicit use-site targets\nThe fix was to explicitly mark the targets, for example with @field:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @field:Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @field:NotNull\n    var name: String,\n\n    @field:Email\n    var email: String\n)\nso that becomes:\npublic class Order {\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue\n  private final long id;\n\n  @NotBlank\n  @NotNull\n  private String name;\n\n  @Email\n  @NotNull\n  private String email;\n…\n}\nThis approach works, but clutters the code with extra syntax. It also requires developers to know about Kotlin’s use-site targets and remember which one each framework expects.\nKotlin 2.2: A new default that just works\nStarting with Kotlin 2.2, annotations without an explicit use-site target are applied to the constructor parameter and the property or field, aligning behavior with what most frameworks expect.\nThat means our original code now works as expected, without requiring any additional annotations:\n@Entity\nclass Order(\n    @Id\n    @GeneratedValue\n    val id: Long,\n\n    @NotBlank\n    var name: String,\n\n    @Email\n    var email: String\n)\nWith the new rule:\nBean validation annotations are present on the property, so validation applies on updates as well as on constructions.\nThe code looks like clean and idiomatic Kotlin, without repetitive @field: syntax or surprising behavior.\nHow to enable the new behavior\n🔗 Kotlin 2.2 is required.\nBy default, the compiler issues warnings if your code’s behavior may change under the new rule.\nIn IntelliJ IDEA, you can also use the quick-fix on a warning to enable the new default project-wide.\n\n\n\n\nTo switch fully to the new behavior in your project, enable it in IntelliJ IDEA via Gradle’s settings.\nAdd the following to your build.gradle.kts:\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-default-target=param-property\")\n    }\n}\n\nIf you prefer to keep the old behavior, you can use:\n\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-defaulting=first-only\")\n    }\n}\nOr stay in a transitional mode with warnings:\nkotlin {\n    compilerOptions {\n        freeCompilerArgs.add(\"-Xannotation-defaulting=first-only-warn\")\n    }\n}\nWhy this matters\nThis change makes annotation behavior more predictable, reduces boilerplate, and eliminates a class of subtle bugs that Spring and JPA developers have faced for years. It’s also a step toward making Kotlin’s integration with major frameworks smoother.\nMore details can be found in KT-73255 and KEEP-402.\nThis update is part of our broader initiative to improve the Kotlin + Spring experience. Stay tuned for more inspections, tooling improvements, and language updates that make working with these frameworks even better.\nHappy coding!",

The partnership provided us with quality data about vulnerable and malicious packages, allowing our IDEs and Qodana to spot them for you in your projects.\nOver the last few months, we have been working on integrating additional data about vulnerable APIs in open-source libraries, provided by the software composition analysis (SCA) data provider. That data has now been delivered to our Package Checker plugin, making it an even more effective tool for maintaining code security.\nThe Vulnerable API feature\nThe Package Checker plugin is powered by data from Mend.io about vulnerable APIs and provides code security analysis to detect the usage of vulnerable methods from open-source libraries. \nOur team has recently been working on enriching Mend.io data to cover more public methods from open-source libraries by analyzing call graphs. This means that the plugin has more data at its disposal than ever before, covering more cases.\nThe plugin’s Vulnerable API feature works for various languages, including Java, Kotlin, C# (in Rider and ReSharper), JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. Here’s how to make sure all the necessary inspections are enabled in the active inspection profile:\nFirst, open the IDE settings (⌘, on macOS or Ctrl+Alt+S on Windows/Linux) and go to Editor | Inspections. \nIn the search bar, type “Vulnerable API” and you’ll see the list of related inspections (the final list depends on the plugins you have installed). \nSimply select the ones you need from the list.\n\n\n\n\nThe Settings window\nHow to use it\nThe inspections provided by the Vulnerable API feature will highlight vulnerable methods from open-source libraries in your code. When you hover over the highlighted code, you’ll see a list of vulnerabilities found in a given API call. To address the problem, pull up the context actions (⌥⏎ on macOS or Alt+Enter on Windows/Linux) and select Go to file with declared dependency from the menu. \n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API highlighting \nThis will take you to the place in the build file where the dependency is declared. There, you can again use ⌥⏎ (on macOS) or Alt+Enter (on Windows/Linux) and select Update to unaffected version. The vulnerability list contains links to additional information in the Mend.io vulnerability database.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable dependency highlighting\nThe Package Checker plugin also provides a way to see the list of vulnerabilities in a dedicated window inside the IDE without opening a browser. You can simply use the Show all… link. This will take you to the Vulnerable Dependencies window, which shows the overall state of the project and provides information about every detected vulnerable dependency.\n\n\n\n\nThe Vulnerable Dependencies window\nThe Vulnerable API and Vulnerable Dependencies features are available in Qodana and can be used in CI/CD or security assessment processes.\n\n\n\n\nVulnerable API feature in Qodana\nLooking ahead\nThese improvements strengthen the existing code security features in JetBrains IDEs and Qodana by providing enhanced vulnerability detection capabilities. Update your IDE to the latest version and enable the Vulnerable API inspections to identify security risks in your codebase.\nYou can learn more about the Package Checker plugin from its page on JetBrains Marketplace, and you can find more information about how to use it in the documentation.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Whether you’re building APIs, dashboards, or machine learning pipelines, choosing the right framework can make or break your project.\nEvery year, we survey thousands of Python developers to help you understand how the ecosystem is evolving, from tooling and languages to frameworks and libraries. Our insights from the State of Python 2025 offer a snapshot of what frameworks developers are using in 2025.\nIn this article, we’ll look at the most popular Python frameworks and libraries. While some long-standing favorites like Django and Flask remain strong, newer contenders like FastAPI are rapidly gaining ground in areas like AI, ML, and data science.\n1. FastAPI\n2024 usage: 38% (+9% from 2023)\nTop of the table is FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+. It was designed to combine Python’s type hinting, asynchronous programming, and OpenAPI standards into a single, developer-friendly package. \nBuilt on top of Starlette (for the web layer) and Pydantic (for data validation), FastAPI offers automatic request validation, serialization, and interactive documentation, all with minimal boilerplate.\nFastAPI is ideal for teams prioritizing speed, simplicity, and standards. It’s especially popular among both web developers and data scientists.\nFastAPI advantages\nGreat for AI/ML: FastAPI is widely used to deploy machine learning models in production. It integrates well with libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face, and supports async model inference pipelines for maximum throughput.\nAsynchronous by default: Built on ASGI, FastAPI supports native async/await, making it ideal for real-time apps, streaming endpoints, and low-latency ML services.\nType-safe and modern: FastAPI uses Python’s type hints to auto-validate requests and generate clean, editor-friendly code, reducing runtime errors and boosting team productivity.\nAuto-generated docs: FastAPI creates interactive documentation via Swagger UI and ReDoc, making it easy for teams to explore and test endpoints without writing any extra docs.\nStrong community momentum: Though it’s relatively young, FastAPI has built a large and active community and has a growing ecosystem of extensions, tutorials, and integrations.\nFastAPI disadvantages\nSteeper learning curve for asynchronous work: async/await unlocks performance, but debugging, testing, and concurrency management can challenge developers new to asynchronous programming.\nBatteries not included: FastAPI lacks built-in tools for authentication, admin, and database management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these manually.\nSmaller ecosystem: FastAPI’s growing plugin landscape still trails Django’s, with fewer ready-made tools for tasks like CMS integration or role-based access control.\n2. Django\n2024 usage: 35% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango once again ranks among the most popular Python frameworks for developers.\nOriginally built for rapid development with built-in security and structure, Django has since evolved into a full-stack toolkit. It’s trusted for everything from content-heavy websites to data science dashboards and ML-powered services.\nIt follows the model-template-view (MTV) pattern and comes with built-in tools for routing, data access, and user management. This allows teams to move from idea to deployment with minimal setup.\nDjango advantages\nBatteries included: Django has a comprehensive set of built-in tools, including an ORM, a user authenticator, an admin panel, and a templating engine. This makes it ideal for teams that want to move quickly without assembling their own stack.\nSecure by default: It includes built-in protections against CSRF, SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities. Django’s security-first approach is one reason it’s trusted by banks, governments, and large enterprises.\nScalable and production-ready: Django supports horizontal scaling, caching, and asynchronous views. It’s been used to power high-traffic platforms like Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus.\nExcellent documentation: Django’s official docs are widely praised for their clarity and completeness, making it accessible to developers at all levels.\nMature ecosystem: Thousands of third-party packages are available for everything from CMS platforms and REST APIs to payments and search.\nLong-term support: Backed by the Django Software Foundation, Django receives regular updates, security patches, and LTS releases, making it a safe choice for long-term projects.\nDjango disadvantages\nHeavyweight for small apps: For simple APIs or microservices, Django’s full-stack approach can feel excessive and slow to configure.\nTightly coupled components: Swapping out parts of the stack, such as the ORM or templating engine, often requires workarounds or deep customization.\nSteeper learning curve: Django’s conventions and depth can be intimidating for beginners or teams used to more minimal frameworks.\n3. Flask\n2024 usage: 34% (+1% from 2023)\nFlask is one of the most popular Python frameworks for small apps, APIs, and data science dashboards. \nIt is a lightweight, unopinionated web framework that gives you full control over application architecture. Flask is classified as a “microframework” because it doesn’t enforce any particular project structure or include built-in tools like ORM or form validation.\nInstead, it provides a simple core and lets you add only what you need. Flask is built on top of Werkzeug (a WSGI utility library) and Jinja2 (a templating engine). It’s known for its clean syntax, intuitive routing, and flexibility.\nIt scales well when paired with extensions like SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, or Flask-RESTful. \nFlask advantages\nLightweight and flexible: Flask doesn’t impose structure or dependencies, making it ideal for microservices, APIs, and teams that want to build a stack from the ground up.\nPopular for data science and ML workflows: Flask is frequently used for experimentation like building dashboards, serving models, or turning notebooks into lightweight web apps.\nBeginner-friendly: With minimal setup and a gentle learning curve, Flask is often recommended as a first web framework for Python developers.\nExtensible: A rich ecosystem of extensions allows you to add features like database integration, form validation, and authentication only when needed.\nModular architecture: Flask’s design makes it easy to break your app into blueprints or integrate with other services, which is perfect for teams working on distributed systems.\nReadable codebase: Flask’s source code is compact and approachable, making it easier to debug, customize, or fork for internal tooling.\nFlask disadvantages\nBring-your-own everything: Unlike Django, Flask doesn’t include an ORM, admin panel, or user management. You’ll need to choose and integrate these yourself.\nDIY security: Flask provides minimal built-in protections, so you implement CSRF protection, input validation, and other best practices manually.\nPotential to become messy: Without conventions or structure, large Flask apps can become difficult to maintain unless you enforce your own architecture and patterns.\n4. Requests\n2024 usage: 33% (+3% from 2023)\nRequests isn’t a web framework, it’s a Python library for making HTTP requests, but its influence on the Python ecosystem is hard to overstate. It’s one of the most downloaded packages on PyPI and is used in everything from web scraping scripts to production-grade microservices.\nRequests is often paired with frameworks like Flask or FastAPI to handle outbound HTTP calls. It abstracts away the complexity of raw sockets and urllib, offering a clean, Pythonic interface for sending and receiving data over the web.\nRequests advantages\nSimple and intuitive: Requests makes HTTP feel like a native part of Python. Its syntax is clean and readable – requests.get(url) is all it takes to fetch a resource.\nMature and stable: With over a decade of development, Requests is battle-tested and widely trusted. It’s used by millions of developers and is a default dependency in many Python projects.\nGreat for REST clients: Requests is ideal for consuming APIs, integrating with SaaS platforms, or building internal tools that rely on external data sources.\nExcellent documentation and community: The official docs are clear and concise, and the library is well-supported by tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, and GitHub issues.\nBroad compatibility: Requests works seamlessly across Python versions and platforms, with built-in support for sessions, cookies, headers, and timeouts.\nRequests disadvantages\nNot async: Requests is synchronous and blocking by design. For high-concurrency workloads or async-native frameworks, alternatives like HTTPX or AIOHTTP are better.\nNo built-in retry logic: While it supports connection pooling and timeouts, retry behavior must be implemented manually or via third-party wrappers like urllib3.\nLimited low-level control: Requests simplifies HTTP calls but abstracts networking details, making advanced tuning (e.g. sockets, DNS, and connection reuse) difficult.\n5. Asyncio\n2024 usage: 23% (+3% from 2023\nAsyncio is Python’s native library for asynchronous programming. It underpins many modern async frameworks and enables developers to write non-blocking code using coroutines, event loops, and async/await syntax.\nWhile not a web framework itself, Asyncio excels at handling I/O-bound tasks such as network requests and subprocesses. It’s often used behind the scenes, but remains a powerful tool for building custom async workflows or integrating with low-level protocols.\nAsyncio advantages\nNative async support: Asyncio is part of the Python standard library and provides first-class support for asynchronous I/O using async/await syntax.\nFoundation for modern frameworks: It powers many of today’s most popular async web frameworks, including FastAPI, Starlette, and AIOHTTP.\nFine-grained control: Developers can manage event loops, schedule coroutines, and coordinate concurrent tasks with precision, which is ideal for building custom async systems.\nEfficient for I/O-bound workloads: Asyncio excels at handling large volumes of concurrent I/O operations, such as API calls, socket connections, or file reads.\nAsyncio disadvantages\nSteep learning curve: Concepts like coroutines, event loops, and task scheduling can be difficult for developers new to asynchronous programming.\nNot a full framework: Asyncio doesn’t provide routing, templating, or request handling. It’s a low-level tool that requires additional libraries for web development.\nDebugging complexity: Async code can be harder to trace and debug, especially when dealing with race conditions or nested coroutines.\n6. Django REST Framework\n2024 usage: 20% (+2% from 2023)\nDjango REST Framework (DRF) is the most widely used extension for building APIs on top of Django. It provides a powerful, flexible toolkit for serializing data, managing permissions, and exposing RESTful endpoints – all while staying tightly integrated with Django’s core components.\nDRF is especially popular in enterprise and backend-heavy applications where teams are already using Django and want to expose a clean, scalable API without switching stacks. It’s also known for its browsable API interface, which makes testing and debugging endpoints much easier during development.\nDjango REST Framework advantages\nDeep Django integration: DRF builds directly on Django’s models, views, and authentication system, making it a natural fit for teams already using Django.\nBrowsable API interface: One of DRF’s key features is its interactive web-based API explorer, which helps developers and testers inspect endpoints without needing external tools.\nFlexible serialization: DRF’s serializers can handle everything from simple fields to deeply nested relationships, and they support both ORM and non-ORM data sources.\nRobust permissions system: DRF includes built-in support for role-based access control, object-level permissions, and custom authorization logic.\nExtensive documentation: DRF is well-documented and widely taught, with a large community and plenty of tutorials, examples, and third-party packages.\nDjango REST Framework disadvantages\nDjango-dependent with heavier setup: DRF is tightly tied to Django and requires more configuration than lightweight frameworks like FastAPI, especially when customizing behavior.\nLess flexible serialization: DRF’s serializers work well for common cases, but customizing them for complex or non-standard data often demands verbose overrides.\nBest of the rest: Frameworks 7–10\nWhile the most popular Python frameworks dominate usage across the ecosystem, several others continue to thrive in more specialized domains. These tools may not rank as high overall, but they play important roles in backend services, data pipelines, and async systems.\n\nFrameworkOverviewAdvantagesDisadvantages\nhttpx\n2024 usage: 15% (+3% from 2023)Modern HTTP client for sync and async workflowsAsync support, HTTP/2, retries, and type hintsNot a web framework, no routing or server-side features\naiohttp\n2024 usage: 13% (+1% from 2023)Async toolkit for HTTP servers and clientsASGI-ready, native WebSocket handling, and flexible middlewareLower-level than FastAPI, less structured for large apps.\nStreamlit\n2024 usage: 12% (+4% from 2023)Dashboard and data app builder for data workflowsFast UI prototyping, with zero front-end knowledge requiredLimited control over layout, less suited for complex UIs.\nStarlette\n2024 usage: 8% (+2% from 2023)Lightweight ASGI framework used by FastAPIExceptional performance, composable design, fine-grained routingRequires manual integration, fewer built-in conveniences\n\n\n\n\n\nChoosing the right framework and tools\nWhether you’re building a blazing-fast API with FastAPI, a full-stack CMS with Django, or a lightweight dashboard with Flask, the most popular Python web frameworks offer solutions for every use case and developer style.\nInsights from the State of Python 2025 show that while Django and Flask remain strong, FastAPI is leading a new wave of async-native, type-safe development. Meanwhile, tools like Requests, Asyncio, and Django REST Framework continue to shape how Python developers build and scale modern web services.\nBut frameworks are only part of the equation. The right development environment can make all the difference, from faster debugging to smarter code completion and seamless framework integration.\nThat’s where PyCharm comes in. Whether you’re working with Django, FastAPI, Flask, or all three, PyCharm offers deep support for Python web development. This includes async debugging, REST client tools, and rich integration with popular libraries and frameworks.\nReady to build something great?

This is a case of “just because you could doesn’t mean you should”.\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to dotInsights by JetBrains! This newsletter is the home for recent .NET and software development related information.\n🌟 Featured Content\nThis month’s featured content is from Chris Woodruff! Chris has been at the forefront of software development since before the first .COM boom, building a career that spans enterprise web development, cloud solutions, software analytics, and developer relations. As an Architect, he applies his deep technical expertise to tackle complex challenges, with a particular focus on API design and scalable architectures. He is recognized as a Microsoft MVP specializing in .NET and Web Development.

His passion for sharing knowledge has made him a sought-after speaker at international conferences, where he discusses topics such as database development, web APIs, and software architecture. He contributes to the developer community by co-hosting The Breakpoint Show podcast and creating content that aids engineers in refining their skills.\nEntity Framework Core (EF Core) has emerged as the preferred Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for modern .NET developers. However, effectively utilizing it requires more than just familiarity with methods like .Add() and .SaveChanges(). This concise newsletter summarizes the essential insights from a full-day EF Core workshop (contact Woody for details below if interested), equipping you with the knowledge necessary to build fast, secure, and scalable data access layers.\nGetting Started with EF Core\nEF Core is a lightweight, extensible, and high-performance data access framework. It supports a clean code-first approach while allowing database-first flexibility when needed.\nKey Concepts:\n✅ DbContext is your gateway to the database. It manages connections change tracking, and query execution.\n✅ Use DbSet<T> to represent your entity collections.\n✅ Code-First is ideal for domain-driven development; use Fluent API to fine-tune schema mappings.\n💡Pro Tip: Always register your DbContext as Scoped. Avoid Singleton lifetimes to prevent memory issues and concurrency errors.\nModeling Relationships Like a Pro\nEF Core handles common relationship types easily, but it’s up to you to configure them correctly.\nModeling Must-Knows:\n✅ Define one-to-many with .HasMany().WithOne()\n✅ Use explicit foreign keys in your model for clarity.\n✅ Prefer eager loading (.Include()) for web APIs to avoid runtime surprises.\n💡Pro Tip: Don’t rely on lazy loading in APIs. It hides performance issues and can cause excessive database queries.\nQuerying with Power and Precision\nLINQ is a powerful abstraction, but be intentional.\nPerformance-First Query Tips:\n✅ Use .Select() to shape the result into DTOs, avoid sending entire entities.\n✅ Apply .AsNoTracking() for read-only queries to reduce memory use.\n✅ Chain .Where() and .OrderBy() before projection to reduce query size.\n💡Pro Tip: Avoid over-fetching by skipping unnecessary .Include() chains. Smaller queries are faster queries.\nSQL Server: Tune What EF Core Generates\nYou’re still writing SQL, it’s just hidden behind LINQ.\nSQL Server Optimization: \n✅ Use SSMS to inspect EF-generated SQL.\n✅ Read execution plans to diagnose slow queries.\n✅ Tune indexes based on frequent query filters or sorts.\n✅ Leverage Query Store to monitor historical query behavior\n💡Pro Tip: Computed columns and filtered indexes can supercharge performance when used intentionally.\nSecure Your Data Layer\nEF Core doesn’t protect you from bad design. Data security must be implemented in your access layer.\nSecurity Strategies:\n✅ Use DTOs to prevent overposting.\n✅ Filter by user role or claim inside the query, not afterward.\n✅ Never interpolate raw SQL, always parameterize inputs.\n✅ Store secrets securely: Use User Secrets in dev, Managed Identity in Azure.\n💡Pro Tip: Your DbContext is an attack surface. Secure it like you would any API.\nTesting EF Core with Confidence\nTesting EF Core doesn’t have to be painful, use the right tools.\nApproach by Test Type:\n✅ Use In-Memory provider for fast unit tests, but be aware it behaves differently from SQL Server.\n✅ Prefer SQLite in-memory for a closer match to production.\n✅ Use Testcontainers or local SQL Server for full integration testing.\n💡Pro Tip: Seed data should be scenario-specific and reset between tests. Use Respawn or EF-based seeding for consistency.\nScaling for the Cloud\nCloud-readiness means EF Core must handle concurrency, resiliency, and high throughput.\nCloud-Ready Practices:\n✅ Use DbContextPool for high-performance APIs.\n✅ Configure retry logic with EnableRetryOnFailure(), and even better, learn and use Polly, which is a library for .NET designed for resilience and transient-fault handling. It enables developers to express policies such as Retry, Circuit Breaker, Timeout, Bulkhead Isolation, and Fallback in a fluent, thread-safe manner.\n✅ Apply distributed caching at the service layer, not the EF level.\n✅ Use sharded/multi-tenant strategies carefully: filtered queries, schema separation, or even DB-per-tenant.\n💡Pro Tip: Azure SQL + EF Core is a battle-tested combo, just don’t forget to tune your retry strategies and monitor connection health.\nCommon Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\nEven experienced developers can fall into subtle traps when working with EF Core. Here are some of the most common mistakes, and how to dodge them in your projects.\n❌ Lazy Loading in APIs\nLazy loading can cause unexpected multiple queries per request. In web APIs, it often results in the dreaded N+1 problem.\n✅ Use Eager Loading or Projections\nExplicitly load related data with .Include() or shape the query using .Select() and DTOs.\n❌ Leaking Entities to the Client\nExposing EF entities directly in your controllers or UI tightly couples your domain to your database schema.\n✅ Use DTOs or ViewModels\nMap to dedicated types that represent what the consumer needs. Nothing more, nothing less.\n❌ Overusing .Include() Chains\nDeep includes may look convenient, but can result in massive SQL joins and redundant data loading.\n✅ Load Only What You Need\nBe intentional. Use shaped queries and projections for complex object graphs.\n❌ Ignoring Execution Plans and SQL Output\nIf you’re not inspecting the SQL your LINQ generates, you’re flying blind.\n✅ Use SSMS and Query Store\nAlways review generated SQL for critical paths. Use SQL Server tooling to optimize indexes and execution plans.\nReady to Go Deeper?\n👉 Explore Chris’s GitHub repo with all of his EF Core demos. \n🗣️ Need help applying this in production or want to discuss the workshop? Book some time or have a code review with Chris. \n🔗 Links\nHere’s the latest from the developer community.\nTechnical Coaching: From One Team to Many Teams 🎥 – Emily Bache\nWhy Most .NET Developers Don’t Need MediatR 🎥 – Gui Ferreira\n2code ^ !2code [S2025E11] Multi-targeting Roslyn Components – Part 1 🎥 – FlashOWare by Eva Ditzelmüller & Stefan Pölz\nThe #1 Reason Your Software System Gets Messy 🎥 – CodeOpinion by Derek Comartin \nSteve Smith on How Generative AI is the New Offshoring 🎥- Technology and Friends by David Giard\nStop Wasting Time: Use the 70/20/10 Rule to grow as a developer 🎙️ – Andrea Angella\nConverting an xUnit test project to TUnit – Andrew Lock\nImplementing BFF Pattern in ASP.NET Core for SPAs and BFF in ASP.NET Core #7 – Introducing the Duende BFF Library – Tore Nestenius\nExploring .NET MAUI: Popups, Messages, and Data Validation – Paul Sheriff\nMastering Incremental Source Generators in C#: A Complete Guide with Example – Ali Hamza Ansari\nCreating Trusted Document Containers with PDF/A-3b in .NET C# – Bjoern Meyer\nHow I Reduced API Response Time by 70% in a Large .NET Project – Ali Hamza Ansari\nEntity Framework or Dapper: which one is better for .NET/C#? – Denis Makarenko\nOptimizing ASP.NET Core Web Site Performance – Duende’s Need for Speed – Khalid Abuhakmeh\nHow to Apply SOLID Principles in AI Development Using Prompt Engineering – Jeyasri Murugan\n🔦 From our .NET Guide\nEach month we feature tutorials or tips from our .NET Guide.\nAzure Functions\nDeveloping and managing cloud solutions often requires a seamless and efficient workflow.

Whether you’re learning Ruby and Rails, pushing open-source forward, creating dev content, or building your passion project, we want to make sure you have the tools to enjoy what you do even more… for free.\nGet RubyMine for free\n                                                    \nAnother chapter in the story\nWe recently introduced a new licensing model for WebStorm, RustRover, Rider, and CLion – making them free for non-commercial use. RubyMine is now joining the party! For commercial use, our existing licensing model still applies.\nWhy are we doing this?\nWe believe developers do their best work when the right tools are accessible. We’ve been listening closely to the Ruby and Rails community – their feedback, success, challenges, and passion for building with joy. Now, we’re making a change that reflects what we’ve heard.\nBy making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, we hope to lower the barrier to starting and help more people write clean, confident Ruby code from day one. It’s our way of supporting the unique Ruby community – from those who choose Ruby for their projects to maintainers of gems and frameworks who contribute to the Ruby ecosystem. Whether you’re debugging at midnight, crafting clever DSLs, or launching your first Rails app, RubyMine is here to help you build smarter (and crash less).\nCommercial vs. non-commercial use\nAs defined in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, commercial use means developing products and earning commercial benefits from your activities. However, certain categories are explicitly excluded from this definition. Common examples of non-commercial uses include learning and self-education, open-source contributions without earning commercial benefits, any form of content creation, and hobby development.\nIt’s important to note that, if you’re using a non-commercial license, you cannot opt out of the collection of anonymous usage statistics. We use this information to improve our products. The data we collect is exclusively that of anonymous feature usages of our IDEs. It is focused on what actions are performed and what types of functionality of the IDE are used. We do not collect any other data. This is similar to our Early Access Program (EAP) and is in compliance with our Privacy Policy.\nFAQ\nBelow are answers to the most common questions. Check out the full FAQ for more information.\nLicensing\nWhat features are included under the free license?\nWith the new non-commercial license type, you can enjoy a full-featured IDE that is identical to its paid version. The only difference is in the Code With Me feature – you get Code With Me Community with your free license.\nWhich license should I choose if I want to use RubyMine for both non-commercial and commercial projects?\nIf you intend to use RubyMine for commercial development for which you will receive direct or indirect commercial advantage or monetary compensation within the meaning of the definitions provided in the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use, you will need to purchase a commercial subscription (either individual or organizational). This license can then also be used for non-commercial development.\nHow do renewals and upgrades work now?\nNon-commercial subscriptions are issued for one year and will automatically renew after that. However, for the renewal to happen, you must have used the assigned license at least once during the last 6 months of the subscription period. If it has been more than 6 months since you last used an IDE activated with this type of license and the renewal did not occur automatically, you can request a new non-commercial subscription again at any time.\nAm I eligible for a refund if I’ve already bought a paid subscription but do non-commercial development?\nIf you’re unsure whether you qualify for a refund, you’ll find full details of our policy here. Please note that if you also work on projects that qualify as commercial usage, you can’t use the free license for them.\nAnonymous data collection \nDoes my IDE send any data to JetBrains?\nThe terms of the non-commercial agreement assume that the product may also electronically send JetBrains anonymized statistics (IDE telemetry) related to your usage of the product’s features. This information may include but is not limited to frameworks, file templates used in the product, actions invoked, and other interactions with the product’s features. This information does not contain personal data.\nIs there a way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics?\nWe appreciate that this might not be convenient for everyone, but there is unfortunately no way to opt out of sending anonymized statistics to JetBrains under the terms of the Toolbox agreement for non-commercial use. The only way to opt out is by switching to either a paid subscription or one of the complimentary options mentioned here.\nGetting a non-commercial subscription \nWhat should I do to apply for this subscription? \nIt can be easily done right inside your IDE:\nInstall RubyMine and run it.\nUpon startup, there will be a license dialog box where you can choose the Non-commercial use option.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nIf you’ve already started a trial period or have activated your IDE using a paid license, you still can switch to a non-commercial subscription by following these steps:\nGo to Help | Register.\nIn the window that opens, click on the Deactivate License button.\nChoose Non-commercial use.\nLog in to your JetBrains account or create a new one. \nAccept the Toolbox Subscription Agreement for Non-Commercial Use.\nEnjoy development in your IDE.\nI don’t see the Non-commercial use option in my IDE. What should I do? \nThe most likely explanation for this is that you’re using an older version of RubyMine. Unfortunately, we don’t support obtaining the non-commercial license for any releases prior to RubyMine 2025.2.1.\nThat’s it for today! If you don’t find an answer to your question, feel free to leave a comment or contact us at sales@jetbrains.com.\nThe RubyMine team\nJetBrains\nMake it happen. With code.",

For years, developers have relied on the Output Window for critical build and debug information. But making sense of it—and translating it into action—has been a challenge. What if you could instantly ask questions about your logs and take action without leaving your workflow? Now you can, thanks to Copilot’s new Output Window context! \n\nSay hello to smarter output window assistance\nIn Visual Studio 17.14, Copilot can now read your Output Window, making it possible to interact with your build and debug logs like never before. Instead of wading through log files and searching for answers, simply ask Copilot questions about the output—whether you’re facing build errors, warnings, or just want to understand what’s happening behind the scenes. \nHow does the Output Window context work? \nIf you’re looking at the output window, you can highlight the logs you want Copilot to help you understand, right click and invoke Copilot Chat. This works in the Build, Debug, Tests, Source Control, Package Manager, or whatever is your active output window. Additionally, if you’re facing an issue, Copilot may opt to take a look on your behalf, especially if you mention the output window with natural language in your prompts. Copilot analyzes the contents of the Output Window, provides helpful explanations, and even suggests next steps.  \nWhy this feature matters for developers \nThe Output Window is a goldmine of information, but its sheer volume and complexity can slow you down. By bridging the gap between raw logs and actionable solutions, Copilot empowers you to debug faster, learn more, and focus on what matters—building great software. This integration is designed to boost productivity, reduce frustration, and help every developer, from beginner to expert, unlock the full power of Visual Studio. \nCheck out the new Visual Studio Hub  \nStay connected with everything Visual Studio in one place!

최근 OpenAI가 GPT-5를 공개하면서 AI 업계는 물론, 우리 일상에도 큰 변화가 찾아왔습니다. 특히 가장 놀라운 소식은 이 강력한 최신 모델이 <b>무료 ChatGPT 사용자에게도 개방</b>되었다는 점인데요. 이제 더 이상 비싼 구독료를 내지 않아도 최신 AI 모델의 파워를 경험할 수 있게 된 거죠. 물론 무료 사용에는 약간의 제약이 있지만, 저의 경험상 일상적인 사용이나 가벼운 작업에는 전혀 부족함이 없었어요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">GPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 것을 넘어, <b>작업의 종류를 스스로 판단하여 최적의 모델을 선택</b>해주는 '실시간 라우터' 기능까지 탑재했습니다. 이전처럼 GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini 같은 복잡한 모델들을 일일이 비교하며 고민할 필요가 없어진 거죠. 저는 이 부분이 정말 좋다고 생각해요. 우리가 필요한 건 결국 최고의 결과물이니까요.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">학술 에세이부터 소셜 미디어 콘텐츠, 심지어 이미지 생성이나 코드 작성, 문서 요약 및 분석까지 &mdash; GPT-5는 정말 다재다능해요. 응답의 정확도는 45%나 향상되었고, 무엇보다 글쓰기 품질이 훨씬 자연스러워졌습니다. 아이디어 구상 단계에서는 거의 완벽에 가까운 파트너라고 할 수 있죠. 만약 ChatGPT의 답변이 '음, 좀 부족한데?' 싶을 때만 유료 구독을 고려해도 늦지 않을 거예요.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-radius: 0 8px 8px 0;\">\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\"><b>  팁:</b> 무료 GPT-5 사용량은 정해져 있지만, 대부분의 캐주얼한 사용에는 충분합니다. 하지만 만약 AI의 답변 품질이 급격히 떨어진다고 느껴진다면, 일일 사용량 한도를 초과했을 가능성이 높으니 잠시 기다리거나 다른 무료 툴과 병행하는 것을 추천해요.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>  GitHub Copilot: 코딩의 든든한 조력자</b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">개발자라면 <u><b><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\"><a style=\"color: #006dd7;\" href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GitHub Copilot</a></span></b></u>을 모르는 분이 거의 없을 겁니다. 그런데 이 강력한 코딩 AI를 <b>Visual Studio Code용 무료 버전</b>으로도 만날 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요?

        "contentSnippet": "복잡한 AI 툴 구독료에 지쳐 더 이상 망설이고 계신가요? 2025년, 돈 한 푼 들이지 않고도 AI의 놀라운 성능을 100% 활용할 수 있는 기막힌 방법을 오늘 알려드릴게요. 이 글에서는 무료 AI 챗봇들을 전략적으로 조합하여 스마트한 업무 환경을 구축하는 최신 비법을 공개합니다. 브레인스토밍부터 코딩, 리서치, 이미지 및 비디오 생성, 심지어 나만의 로컬 AI 환경 구축까지, 각 분야 최고의 무료 AI 툴들을 자세히 살펴보고 그 활용 팁을 공유해 드릴 예정이에요. 지금 바로 AI 풀파워를 경험하고 여러분의 생산성을 한 단계 업그레이드해보는 건 어떠세요?\n  ChatGPT: 브레인스토밍과 콘텐츠 생성의 마스터\n\n\n \n 솔직히 말해볼까요? 최근 OpenAI가 GPT-5를 공개하면서 AI 업계는 물론, 우리 일상에도 큰 변화가 찾아왔습니다. 특히 가장 놀라운 소식은 이 강력한 최신 모델이 무료 ChatGPT 사용자에게도 개방되었다는 점인데요. 이제 더 이상 비싼 구독료를 내지 않아도 최신 AI 모델의 파워를 경험할 수 있게 된 거죠. 물론 무료 사용에는 약간의 제약이 있지만, 저의 경험상 일상적인 사용이나 가벼운 작업에는 전혀 부족함이 없었어요.\nGPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 것을 넘어, 작업의 종류를 스스로 판단하여 최적의 모델을 선택해주는 '실시간 라우터' 기능까지 탑재했습니다. 이전처럼 GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini 같은 복잡한 모델들을 일일이 비교하며 고민할 필요가 없어진 거죠. 저는 이 부분이 정말 좋다고 생각해요. 우리가 필요한 건 결국 최고의 결과물이니까요.\n학술 에세이부터 소셜 미디어 콘텐츠, 심지어 이미지 생성이나 코드 작성, 문서 요약 및 분석까지 — GPT-5는 정말 다재다능해요. 응답의 정확도는 45%나 향상되었고, 무엇보다 글쓰기 품질이 훨씬 자연스러워졌습니다. 아이디어 구상 단계에서는 거의 완벽에 가까운 파트너라고 할 수 있죠. 만약 ChatGPT의 답변이 '음, 좀 부족한데?' 싶을 때만 유료 구독을 고려해도 늦지 않을 거예요.\n  팁: 무료 GPT-5 사용량은 정해져 있지만, 대부분의 캐주얼한 사용에는 충분합니다. 하지만 만약 AI의 답변 품질이 급격히 떨어진다고 느껴진다면, 일일 사용량 한도를 초과했을 가능성이 높으니 잠시 기다리거나 다른 무료 툴과 병행하는 것을 추천해요.\n  GitHub Copilot: 코딩의 든든한 조력자\n개발자라면 GitHub Copilot을 모르는 분이 거의 없을 겁니다. 그런데 이 강력한 코딩 AI를 Visual Studio Code용 무료 버전으로도 만날 수 있다는 사실, 알고 계셨나요? 매월 2,000건의 코드 완성 기능과 50건의 채팅 요청을 무료로 사용할 수 있어요. 하루 업무 시간으로 따지면 약 80건의 코드 완성 기능인데, 개인 프로젝트나 학습용으로는 정말 충분한 양이라고 생각해요.\n\n\n놀랍게도 이 무료 플랜에는 OpenAI, Google, Anthropic 등 최고 수준의 AI 모델들이 포함되어 있습니다. 신용카드 정보나 별도의 가입 절차 없이 GitHub 계정만 있으면 바로 이용 가능하죠. 웹 툴과 Visual Studio Code 확장 프로그램 형태로 모두 제공되어, 개발자들이 가장 많이 사용하는 코드 에디터 내에서 편리하게 사용할 수 있습니다.\n간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 전체 프로젝트의 골격을 만들거나, 코드 샘플 또는 바로 사용 가능한 저장소 구조를 몇 분 만에 얻을 수 있어요. 특히 Visual Studio Code에서 사용하면 전체 프로젝트를 인식하여 여러 파일과 동시에 작업할 수 있는 '프로젝트 인지' 기능은 정말 강력합니다. 그리고 무엇보다, 학생이나 교사, 혹은 인기 있는 오픈소스 프로젝트를 관리하는 분들은 Copilot Pro를 무료로 받을 수 있다는 사실! 학생분들은 이 혜택을 꼭 놓치지 말고 활용해보세요.\n  Perplexity: 빠른 정보 탐색과 심층 연구의 동반자\n어떤 주제에 대해 빠르게 정보를 찾아야 할 때, 저는 항상 Perplexity를 찾게 돼요. 이 툴은 기존의 전통적인 연구 방식을 완전히 대체하진 못하지만, 특정 주제에 대한 사전 지식이 조금이라도 있다면 정보를 취합하고 정리하는 데 정말 유용합니다. 특히 명확한 출처를 인용하고 대부분 실시간 정보를 제공한다는 점이 큰 장점이죠.\nPerplexity의 무료 계정은 기본 검색은 무제한으로 제공하고, 매일 5번의 Pro 검색 기회를 줍니다. 또한 하루에 3개의 파일을 첨부하여 AI가 문서를 분석하게 할 수도 있어요. 제가 직접 써보니, 자료 조사나 팩트 체크, 문서 요약 등 웬만한 연구 요구사항은 무료 버전으로도 충분히 해결할 수 있었습니다.\n⚠️ 주의: 무료 버전에서는 AI가 쿼리에 가장 적합한 모델(Sonar, Claude Sonnet 4.0, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro 등)을 자동으로 선택하는데, 이 선택이 항상 완벽하지 않을 수도 있다는 점을 염두에 두세요. 때로는 기대 이하의 응답을 받을 수도 있습니다.\n그래도 매일 3번의 'Research' 기능을 이용할 수 있다는 점은 큰 이점이에요. ChatGPT의 심층 연구 기능도 좋지만, 저는 Perplexity의 Research 검색이 더 정확하고 업데이트된 정보를 제공하는 경우가 많다고 느꼈어요. 확실히 자료 검색에 특화된 툴이라는 생각이 듭니다.\n  Leonardo.AI: 상상력을 현실로, 무료 이미지 생성\nAI 이미지 생성, 이제 어렵거나 비쌀 필요가 없습니다. Leonardo.AI는 온라인에서 사용할 수 있는 최고의 멀티 모델 이미지 생성 툴 중 하나인데요. 무료 계정으로 매일 150개의 토큰을 제공하며, 이를 통해 최대 25개의 16:9 비율 1184x672 해상도 이미지를 Flux Schnell 모델로 생성할 수 있어요.\nGPT-Image-1을 포함한 다양한 모델들이 있지만, 이미지 생성에 필요한 토큰 수는 모델마다 다릅니다. 현재로서는 Flux Schnell 모델이 가장 저렴하게 이미지를 만들 수 있어, 프롬프트를 테스트하고 초기 아이디어를 구체화하는 데 아주 적합해요. 저는 이 툴을 이용해 다양한 시안을 빠르게 만들어보곤 하는데, 정말 효율적입니다.\n\n\n또한, AI 기반의 프롬프트 개선 기능이 있어서 초보자도 쉽게 좋은 결과물을 얻을 수 있도록 도와줍니다. 다양한 사전 설정된 이미지 생성 스타일도 있어서 유튜브 썸네일부터 회사 로고까지, 몇 분 안에 비용 부담 없이 만들 수 있어요. Canva나 PhotoPea 같은 무료 이미지 편집기와 함께 사용하면 더더욱 훌륭한 결과물을 얻을 수 있으니 꼭 시도해보세요.\n  FlexClip: 간편하게 AI 비디오 제작 도전하기\nAI 이미지 생성에 이어 AI 비디오 생성에도 도전하고 싶으신가요? FlexClip은 다양한 AI 기반 도구들을 갖춘 온라인 플랫폼입니다. 이미지, 비디오, 음성 등 여러 가지를 생성할 수 있지만, 특히 강력한 AI 비디오 생성 기능과 편리한 편집 툴이 돋보이는 곳이에요.\n무료 플랜으로는 720p HD 해상도로 비디오를 다운로드할 수 있고, 최대 12개의 프로젝트를 생성할 수 있으며, 각 비디오는 최대 10분 길이까지 가능해요. 프로젝트당 하나의 스톡 비디오와 오디오도 제공됩니다. 특히, AI 비디오 생성기와 AI 스크립트 작성기를 포함한 FlexClip의 AI 툴을 10회까지 무료로 시도해볼 수 있다는 점이 매력적이에요.\n\n\n \n 간단한 텍스트 프롬프트만으로 AI가 스크립트를 작성하고, 이 스크립트를 기반으로 AI가 이미지를 조합하여 비디오를 만들어주는 방식입니다. 다만, 생성되는 비디오가 대부분 AI 생성 이미지의 시퀀스에 AI 음성이 내레이션을 하는 형태라는 점은 알아두시면 좋아요. 아직은 '와!' 할 정도의 고품질 실사 영상을 무료로 얻기는 어렵지만, 컨셉 비디오나 설명 영상 제작에는 충분히 활용 가능합니다.\nAI 비디오 생성은 이미지 생성과 달리, 무료로 '제대로 쓸만한' 결과물을 제공하는 서비스를 찾기가 정말 어려워요. FlexClip은 Leonardo.AI와 비슷한 크레딧 시스템을 사용하며, 구독 없이도 추가 크레딧을 구매하여 더 많은 AI 툴을 사용할 수 있습니다. 갑자기 비디오가 필요할 때 아주 유용한 옵션이 될 거예요.\n  Ollama: 나만의 AI 비서, 로컬에서 실행하기\n진정한 '무료 AI'의 맛을 보고 싶다면, 저는 주저 없이 Ollama를 추천합니다. 이 툴은 강력한 오픈소스 AI 모델들을 인터넷 연결 없이, 사용량 제한 없이, 그리고 가장 중요한 개인 데이터 유출 걱정 없이 여러분의 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이 점이 가장 큰 장점이라고 생각해요.\nLlama 3.2, DeepSeek-R1, Mistral 같은 유명 모델들을 여러분의 하드웨어 사양만 충분하다면 돌려볼 수 있어요. Ollama의 라이브러리 페이지에 가면 지원되는 모델 목록을 볼 수 있는데, 정말 다양한 종류가 있어서 각자의 컴퓨터 환경에 맞는 모델을 선택하기 좋죠. 최근에는 OpenAI와의 파트너십을 통해 최신 오픈 가중치 모델들도 Ollama에서 사용할 수 있게 되었다고 하니, 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n \n설치도 믿을 수 없을 정도로 빠르고 쉬웠어요. Windows, Linux, macOS용 Ollama를 다운로드하고, 간단한 명령 한 줄이면 지원되는 어떤 모델이든 즉시 사용할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, Google의 오픈 가중치 AI 모델인 Gemma 3를 실행하고 싶다면 그저 ollama run gemma3라고 입력하면 끝이에요. 정말 간편하죠!\n물론 몇 가지 제약은 있습니다. 챗봇이 명령 프롬프트 창에서 실행되기 때문에 대화 기록 기능이나 파일 업로드 같은 편리한 기능은 기본적으로 제공되지 않아요. 로컬에 저장된 파일과 AI 모델을 상호작용하게 만들 수는 있지만, 약간의 프로그래밍 지식이 필요하긴 합니다.\n  팁: Ollama를 제대로 활용하려면 최소 8GB RAM(7B 모델용), 16GB RAM(13B 모델용), 32GB RAM(33B 모델용)이 필요합니다. 컴퓨터 사양을 미리 확인해보고 적절한 모델을 선택하는 것이 중요해요.\n이러한 제약에도 불구하고, 단 몇 단계만으로 나만의 AI 모델을 로컬에서 실행할 수 있다는 점은 AI를 깊이 있게 탐구하고 싶거나 AI 기반 앱을 개발하는 분들에게 Ollama가 아주 매력적인 툴이 될 수 있다는 생각이 들어요.\n  돈 한 푼 안 쓰고 AI 풀파워, 이제 여러분의 차례!\n지금까지 다양한 무료 AI 툴들을 살펴보았는데요. 중요한 것은 단순히 여러 툴을 사용하는 것이 아니라, 각 툴의 강점을 파악하고 여러분의 특정 작업에 전략적으로 조합하여 활용하는 것입니다. 제가 직접 경험해보니, 유료 AI 플랜에서 얻을 수 있는 대부분의 기능을 여러 전문화된 무료 툴들을 통해 비용 부담 없이 누릴 수 있었어요.\n2025년, 더 이상 AI 활용을 주저할 필요가 없습니다. 브레인스토밍부터 코딩, 리서치, 시각 콘텐츠 제작, 그리고 나만의 AI 환경 구축까지—오늘 소개해 드린 무료 AI 툴들을 잘 활용하여 여러분의 업무와 학습, 그리고 일상에 AI의 놀라운 생산성을 더해보세요. 스마트 워크의 진정한 마스터가 되는 길, 이제 여러분의 손에 달려 있습니다!\n  핵심 요약\n• 무료 AI 툴 조합은 현명한 선택: 각 툴의 강점을 활용해 유료 구독 없이도 강력한 AI 기능을 누릴 수 있습니다.\n• GPT-5 무료 제공으로 접근성 UP: ChatGPT의 최신 모델을 이제 무료로 경험하며 브레인스토밍과 콘텐츠 생산성을 극대화하세요.\n• 특화된 무료 툴로 효율 증대: GitHub Copilot(코딩), Perplexity(리서치), Leonardo.AI(이미지), FlexClip(비디오) 등 전문 분야 툴을 활용하세요.\n• Ollama로 로컬 AI 시대 개척: 개인 정보 유출 걱정 없이 강력한 AI 모델을 내 컴퓨터에서 직접 돌려보세요.\n이러한 무료 AI 툴들을 전략적으로 활용한다면, 유료 서비스 못지않은 효율과 생산성을 경험하실 수 있습니다. 지금 바로 여러분의 워크플로우에 AI를 추가해 보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: GPT-5가 무료로 제공되면서 어떤 점이 가장 좋아졌나요?\nA1: 이제 무료 사용자도 OpenAI의 최신 모델을 사용할 수 있게 되어 브레인스토밍과 콘텐츠 생성 시 훨씬 더 자연스럽고 정확한 결과물을 기대할 수 있습니다. 특히, AI가 작업에 가장 적합한 모델을 자동으로 선택해주는 통합 플랫폼이라 편리해요.\nQ2: 무료 AI 툴들을 효과적으로 조합하는 팁이 있을까요?\nA2: 네, 각 툴의 특장점을 명확히 이해하고 업무의 성격에 맞춰 전략적으로 활용하는 것이 중요해요. 예를 들어, 아이디어 구상에는 ChatGPT, 코딩에는 GitHub Copilot, 자료 조사에는 Perplexity를 사용하는 식이죠. 이렇게 역할 분담을 하면 유료 서비스 이상의 효과를 볼 수 있답니다.\nQ3: Ollama를 이용한 로컬 AI 환경 구축은 어떤 장점이 있나요?\nA3: 가장 큰 장점은 인터넷 연결 없이도 AI 모델을 내 컴퓨터에서 직접 실행할 수 있다는 점이에요. 이 덕분에 데이터 보안과 개인 정보 보호가 철저히 보장되고, 사용량 제한 걱정 없이 마음껏 AI를 활용하며 테스트할 수 있습니다.\nQ4: 무료 AI 이미지/비디오 생성 툴로도 고품질 결과물을 얻을 수 있나요?\nA4: 물론이죠!

MLS는 왜 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수 영입에 집중하는 걸까요?\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}‘경제공동체’로 묶인 MLS\nMLS의 구조는 일반적인 유럽 리그와 다릅니다. 30개 구단은 독립적으로 운영되지만, 동시에 MLS라는 기업의 지분을 가진 투자자이기도 합니다. 다시 말해 MLS 전체의 적자가 곧 구단의 적자가 되기 때문에 30개 구단은 하나의 경제 공동체로 묶여 있는 셈이죠.\n이 때문에 구단이 벌어들이는 입장 수입의 30%와 선수 이적료 수입의 25%는 MLS가 가져갑니다. 반대로 MLS가 확보한 전국 방송 중계권료와 리그 스폰서십 수익은 다시 구단에 배분됩니다. 이런 구조 덕분에 MLS는 ‘싱글 엔터티(Single Entity)’라는 독특한 운영 모델을 가지고 성장할 수 있었습니다.\n이를 상징하는 지표가 바로 신규 구단 창단 가입금(Expansion Fee)입니다. 신규 구단이 MLS의 ‘주주’가 되기 위해 내야 하는 금액인데, 이 금액이 폭등하고 있습니다. 2005년 104억 원 수준이던 가입금은 2023년 샌디에이고 FC 창단 당시 6,929억 원에 달했습니다. 18년 사이에 무려 70배 가까이 오른 것이죠. 이는 투자처로서 MLS의 가치가 얼마나 올라갔는지를 보여줍니다.\n.css-of5acw{margin:24px 0 8px;text-align:center;}.css-1pgssrp{max-width:100%;border-radius:16px;}\nMLS의 성장에 함께한\n사커 맘, 히스패닉, NFL\nMLS의 성장에는 리그 구조뿐 아니라 사회·문화적 배경도 크게 작용했습니다. 대표적으로 1990년대 후반 ‘사커 맘’ 열풍이 있었습니다. 당시만 해도 미국에서 축구는 흔하지 않았고 비용도 많이 드는 스포츠였지만, 교외에 살던 중산층 어머니들은 자녀 교육과 또래 교류를 위해 축구를 선택했습니다. 그렇게 성장한 아이들은 자연스럽게 축구와 MLS에 친숙해졌습니다.\n히스패닉 팬덤도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. 현재 MLS 팬의 약 30%는 히스패닉입니다. 축구 강국 출신 이민자들은 MLS의 주요 팬층으로 자리 잡았고, MLS도 이들을 겨냥해 플로리다·캘리포니아 등 히스패닉 밀집 지역에 구단을 세웠습니다. 메시의 인터 마이애미와 손흥민의 LAFC가 대표적이죠. 더 나아가 MLS의 마케팅 자회사 SUM은 멕시코 대표팀의 미국 내 중계권과 스폰서십 권리까지 확보하며 안정적인 수익원을 마련했습니다.\nNFL과의 협력도 중요했습니다. MLS 상위 구단 대부분이 NFL 팀과 경기장을 공유합니다. 평균 관중 46,831명으로 MLS에서 가장 많은 관중을 모으는 애틀랜타 유나이티드의 경우, NFL 구단 애틀랜타 팰컨스와 같은 경기장을 홈으로 사용하고 있습니다. NFL은 시즌당 홈 경기가 8회뿐이어서 경기장 활용도를 높이기 위해 MLS와 협력하는 것이 유리했습니다. 반대로 MLS는 새로운 축구 전용 경기장을 짓지 않고 NFL 경기장을 활용하면서 비용을 줄일 수 있었죠.\n\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}애틀랜타 팰컨스와 애틀랜타 유나이티드가 함께 사용하는 Mercedes-Benz Stadium / 사진: Sipa USA\nMLS의 경영 철학은\n연봉 지출 최소화\nMLS는 리그 사업권과 선수 계약권을 직접 소유하고 있습니다. 구단은 단지 그 권리를 위임받아 운영할 뿐이죠. 그래서 모든 구단은 리그가 정한 규칙 안에서 움직여야 합니다. MLS 소속 선수들이 똑같이 아디다스 유니폼을 입는 것도 같은 맥락입니다.\n이런 구조 속에서 MLS는 철저히 비용 통제를 이어왔습니다. 대표적인 장치가 샐러리 캡(Salary Cap)*입니다. 2025년 기준으로 MLS 한 팀이 쓸 수 있는 연봉 총액은 약 83억 원. 미국 4대 프로스포츠(NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL)와 비교하면 확연히 낮은 수준입니다.\n* 팀이 선수 연봉에 쓸 수 있는 총액을 제한하는 제도\n\n짠물 경영은 구단 운영 안정성에는 도움이 됐지만, 미국 축구의 저변 확대에는 큰 걸림돌이 되었습니다. 운동 능력이 뛰어난 유망주들이 더 많은 연봉을 보장받을 수 있는 야구·농구·미식축구 대신 굳이 축구를 선택할 이유가 없었던 것이죠. 자유계약(FA) 제도마저 없어 연봉 대박을 노릴 기회도 없으니, MLS는 재능 있는 인재들을 끌어들이지 못했습니다.\n이 때문에 미국 대표팀 성적이 부진할 때마다 MLS의 낮은 연봉 정책은 도마에 올랐습니다. 그러나 리그는 쉽게 방향을 틀 수 없었습니다. 1968년부터 1984년까지 운영되던 북미사커리그(NASL)가 과도한 연봉 지출로 몰락한 전례가 있었기 때문입니다. 당시 NASL은 펠레, 베켄바워, 크루이프 같은 슈퍼스타에게 천문학적인 돈을 쓰다 결국 도산했죠.\n스타 선수를 데려오기 위해\nMLS가 도입한 제도\nMLS는 오랫동안 샐러리 캡을 무기로 선수 인건비를 억제해왔습니다. 하지만 2000년대 중반, 리그는 스타 파워 부족이라는 고민에 직면했습니다. 세계적인 선수를 데려오려면 이적료뿐 아니라 고액 연봉이 필수인데, 샐러리 캡 안에서는 불가능했기 때문입니다.\n결국 2007년, 데이비드 베컴이 LA 갤럭시에 합류하면서 새로운 제도가 도입됐습니다. 바로 ‘지정 선수 제도(일명 베컴 룰)’입니다. 한 팀에서 최대 3명까지는 연봉을 샐러리 캡 적용에서 제외할 수 있도록 한 것이죠. 여기에 MLS는 일반 할당금(General Allocation Money)과 목표 할당금(Targeted Allocation Money)이라는 장치도 추가했습니다. 몸값이 비싼 스타 선수를 데려올 때 MLS가 이적료와 연봉의 일부를 지원하는 방식입니다.\n2025년 기준으로 모든 구단은 연간 약 40억 원의 일반 할당금과 30억 원의 목표 할당금을 배정받습니다. 이 제도 덕분에 제라드, 램파드, 루니, 앙리, 즐라탄 같은 유럽의 빅스타들이 차례로 MLS로 건너왔습니다. 미국 팬들에게는 친숙한 얼굴들이었고, 이는 곧 MLS의 대중적 인지도와 팬덤 확장으로 이어졌습니다.\n하지만 부작용도 있었습니다. 리그가 은퇴 직전의 베테랑들을 끌어모으면서 MLS는 펜션 리그(Pension League)라는 꼬리표를 달게 됐습니다. 전성기를 지난 선수들이 마지막으로 연금을 챙기는 무대라는 비아냥이었죠. 그만큼 젊은 유망주 육성은 뒷전이 됐고, 리그가 미국 축구의 경쟁력 강화보다는 수익 극대화에만 치중한다는 비판이 뒤따랐습니다.\nEPL 견제를 위해\nMLS가 선택한 메시\n미국 4대 프로 스포츠*는 세계 최고 수준의 경기력과 산업 규모를 갖추고 있어 해외 리그를 경쟁 상대로 두지 않습니다. 하지만 MLS는 다릅니다. 세계 최고 수준의 프로 축구 리그가 유럽에 있고, 그중에서도 EPL(잉글랜드 프리미어리그)은 이미 미국 시장에서 막강한 팬덤을 확보했습니다. NBC가 EPL 중계권에 매년 6,238억 원을 지불하는 이유도 여기에 있습니다. 이는 애플TV가 MLS 중계권에 지불하는 금액(3,466억 원)의 거의 두 배죠.\n* NFL(미식축구), NBA(농구), MLB(야구), NHL(아이스하키)\nEPL의 영향력이 커지자 MLS는 새로운 도전을 시작해야 했고, 답은 명확했습니다. 당장 펜션 리그라는 비난을 받더라도 스타 선수 영입에 더 과감한 투자를 하는 것이었습니다. 경기력이나 상품성에서 당장 유럽 리그를 능가할 수는 없지만, EPL이 미국 시장을 잠식하는 것을 막기 위해서는 세계적인 아이콘을 확보할 필요가 있었죠.\n\nFC 바르셀로나에서 뛰던 베테랑 선수들을 대거 영입한 인터 마이애미 / 사진: Action Images\n그 선택은 리오넬 메시였습니다. 2023년, 살아 있는 전설, 메시는 인터 마이애미 유니폼을 입었습니다. 2025년 그의 연봉은 약 278억 원. MLS에서 이 숫자는 사실상 천문학적인 수준입니다. 메시 한 명의 연봉보다 팀 전체 연봉이 낮은 구단이 무려 21개에 달합니다. 아디다스 후원 계약과 MLS 중계 파트너 애플TV의 수익 공유까지 포함하면, 그의 연간 수입은 400억 원 이상으로 추정됩니다.\n메시 효과는 즉각적으로 나타났습니다. 애플TV의 MLS 중계 구독자 수는 두 배로 늘었고, 리그 스폰서십 수익은 13% 증가했습니다. 홈과 원정 경기를 가리지 않고 구름 관중이 몰려들었고, 메시가 이끄는 인터 마이애미는 2024년 정규리그 우승(서포터스 쉴드)을 차지했습니다. 동시에 MLS 구단 가운데 가장 많은 수입(약 2,501억 원)과 영업이익(695억 원)을 기록하며, ‘스타 한 명이 리그 전체를 바꿀 수 있다’는 사실을 입증했죠.\n펜션 리그 꼬리표를\n떼줄 선수, 손흥민\n2025년, 손흥민이 MLS 역대 최고 이적료인 367억 원을 기록하며 LAFC에 합류했습니다. 이 영입은 세계 축구의 중심을 노리는 MLS의 전략과, 리그 최고 클럽을 지향하는 LAFC의 야심이 맞아떨어진 결과였습니다.\n38세로 선수 생활 황혼기에 접어든 메시와 달리 손흥민은 아직 33세입니다. 앞으로 2~3년은 정상급 기량을 발휘할 수 있는 나이죠. 미국 내에서도 손흥민은 여전히 젊고 에너지가 넘치는 선수로 평가받습니다. 손흥민의 합류는 MLS가 오랫동안 따라붙은 ‘펜션 리그’ 이미지를 희석할 수 있는 카드였습니다.\nLAFC 역시 손흥민을 간절히 원했습니다. EPL 득점왕 출신인 손흥민은 ‘젊은 베테랑’으로서 여전히 월드 클래스 스타입니다. 계약 연장 옵션을 포함하면 2029년까지 활약할 수 있어, 명문 구단을 꿈꾸는 LAFC의 비전에 정확히 부합하는 자원이라고 할 수 있습니다.\n실제 성적과 구단 가치도 이를 뒷받침합니다. 2018년 MLS에 참가한 LAFC는 정규리그 우승 2회(2019, 2022), MLS 컵 우승 1회(2022)를 기록하며 꾸준히 좋은 성적을 내왔습니다. 2024년 기준 구단 가치는 1조 7,366억 원으로 MLS 전체 1위. 두터운 팬층을 바탕으로 안정적인 수익 모델을 갖추고 있다는 점에서, 메시 합류 전까지 관중 수 최하위였던 인터 마이애미와는 분명한 차별성을 보여줍니다. 게다가 LA가 약 23만 명으로 추산되는 한인 교민 사회라는 점도 매력적인 이유죠.\n\n미국에서 여전히 정상급 기량을 보이는 손흥민 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\nMLS가 북중미 월드컵에 거는 기대\nMLS는 수익 확대 측면에서는 분명 성공한 리그입니다. 하지만 아직 풀어야 할 숙제가 남아 있습니다. 리그 하부 구조를 튼튼히 하려면 유소년 육성 프로그램에 더 많은 관심과 투자가 필요합니다. 그래야 젊은 유망주들이 MLS에서 활약하면서 리그 경쟁력을 높일 수 있겠죠. 이를 위해 가장 먼저 개선해야 할 부분은 낮은 평균 연봉입니다. 지금처럼 연봉이 낮다면, 재능 있는 인재들이 다른 종목으로 빠져나가는 문제를 해결하기 어렵기 때문이죠.\n1994년 미국 월드컵은 MLS 창설의 출발점이었습니다. 2026년 북중미 월드컵은 MLS가 크게 도약할 기회입니다. 이를 위해서는 무엇보다 리그에서 활약하는 월드컵 스타들이 더 많이 등장해야 합니다. MLS 선수들이 월드컵 무대에서 주목받는다면, 리그의 위상은 물론 선수들의 몸값과 연봉 수준까지 자연스럽게 높아질 수 있을 것입니다.\n만약 한국 대표팀의 경기가 LA에서 열리고, 손흥민이 그 무대에서 대활약을 펼친다면 어떨까요. 그는 LAFC를 넘어 MLS 전체의 롤 모델이 될 가능성이 큽니다. 어쩌면 이것이야말로 손흥민이 MLS 이적을 결심한 결정적 이유일지도 모릅니다. 한국 대표팀 주장으로 쌓아온 그의 여정이 북중미 월드컵에서 해피엔딩으로 이어지길 기대해봅니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",

나누고 싶은 세션 4가지를 요약해서 소개할게요.\n\n정복이 아닌 개척\n— 토스코어 Commerce Domain 박웅도\n\n“토스 커머스는 ‘정복’이 아니라 ‘개척’을 선택했습니다. 이미 거대한 커머스 플랫폼이 존재하는 시장에서 똑같이 싸우는 건 답이 아니었죠. 대신 우리가 갈 수 있는 새로운 항로를 찾아 모험을 시작했습니다.\n우리가 이 모험에서 이루고 싶은 건, 사용자가 수많은 상품 속에서 ‘운명의 상품’을 만나는 경험이었습니다. 이를 위해 배를 전면적으로 고쳐야 했습니다. 우선 단순히 상품만 나열되던 기존 형태에서 벗어나, 피드 탐색을 기반으로 하는 화면으로 UX를 개편했습니다. 성과 보장 광고 상품을 만들어 트래픽을 수익으로 전환하기도 했습니다. 그리고 모든 지면을 카탈로그화해 사용자가 가격을 쉽게 비교하고, 결제도 보다 간편하게 할 수 있도록 했습니다.\n이렇게 배를 고치는 과정에서 우리는 Traffic = Revenue라는 공식을 직접 검증할 수 있었습니다. 이제 배도 튼튼하게 고쳤으니, 사용자에게 딱 맞는 상품을 추천하는 시스템을 제대로 만들고 적용하는 항해를 시작하려 합니다.\n물론 넘어야 할 난관은 여전히 많습니다. “토스답지 않은 디자인이다.”, “왜 토스에서 쇼핑을 하냐.”는 피드백도 직접 들었습니다. 하지만 변명 대신 개선을 택하겠습니다. 시스템과 디자인은 지속적으로 개편하고, 수만 명의 셀러와 함께 좋은 상품을 쌓아가겠습니다. 내부에서 오는 피드백에도 귀 기울이며 정면으로 마주하겠습니다. 그동안 경험할 수 없었던 새로운 커머스 서비스를 만들어보겠습니다. 정해진 길을 따르기보다, 유저의 즐거운 경험을 위해 나아가는 것. 그것이 바로 해적정신일 테니까요.”\n\nwow, who made this?\n— 토스인컴 Toss Income Product team 윤주승, 한다솜\n\n“토스인컴에게 5월은 가장 중요한 시즌입니다. 종합소득세 정기신고가 있는 달로서, 토스인컴의 대표 서비스인 숨은 환급액 찾기가 1년 중 가장 많이 이용되는 시기이기 때문이죠. \n토스인컴의 핵심 동력은 ‘환급 엔진’입니다. 저희는 시장에서 가장 정확한 환급 엔진을 만들어가고 있다고 자부해요. 때론 너무 정확하다 보니 타사보다 적은 환급액이 나오는 것처럼 보일 때도 있지만, 환급 신청 이후의 불편한 재확인과 수정 신고의 발생 가능성을 최소화하는 안전한 방식으로 구축했기 때문이에요. 특히 제품의 정확도와 안전성은 서비스의 신뢰와 직결되는 일이기 때문에, 가장 중요한 핵심 가치라고 생각하고 있습니다.\n그런데 아무리 좋은 환급 엔진을 갖췄다 해도 사용자가 오지 않으면 의미가 없겠죠. 그래서 최종 도착지인 ‘환급액 찾기’에 사용자를 데려오기 위해 17~20 개에 달하는 연계 제품을 내놓으며 사용 경험을 실험했습니다. 그리고 UX 라이팅·ML·디자인 챕터 등과의 협업을 통해 최적화된 이용 안내 메시지를 가장 유효한 고객군에게 전달해나갔죠.\n여기에 더해, 사용자 경험에 혁신을 불러올 수 있는 토스인컴 만의 시도에 대해 많이 고민하고 시도했습니다. 완전히 새로운 관점과 시도였기에 사전 검증의 어려움을 겪기도 했는데요. 당장의 결과가 나오지 않더라도 우리가 혁신이라고 믿으면 과감하게 시도해본다는 인컴 만의 해적 정신을 발휘하며 시도를 이어갔어요. 덕분에 환급 서비스의 끝판왕이라는 별명을 얻은 파격적인 기능인 ‘선정산/후결제’가 탄생할 수 있었습니다.\n이번 상반기의 치열했던 경험을 통해 얻은 인사이트는 심플합니다. 신뢰를 줄 수 있는 제품 본연의 가치 위에 유저를 위한 과감한 시도가 함께할 때, 높은 제품 성장과 고객 만족을 만들어낼 수 있다는 것 이었습니다.토스인컴의 다음 항해를 기대해주세요!”\n\n수신제가치국평천하\n— 토스플레이스 POS Home Team 김민주, 김태형\n\n“저희 팀이 올해 붙잡은 화두는 ‘수신제가치국평천하’였습니다. 스스로를 단단히 세우고 집안을 정리해야 나라를 다스릴 수 있듯, 포스홈이 바로 서야 토스포스* 천하를 평정할 수 있다고 믿었거든요. 그래서 지난 학기 포스 홈팀은 집을 바로 세우는 일에 집중했습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 토스플레이스가 만든 POS 시스템(매장 주문·결제·매출 관리 서비스)\n막상 집을 바로 세우려다 보니 고칠 게 정말 많았어요. 집을 지으면 10년 늙는다는 말이 실감될 정도로요. 기능이 부족하다는 사장님들의 의견, 홈 화면이 광고판처럼 복잡하다는 지적, 설치가 어렵다는 대리점의 아쉬움까지! 하지만 뚝딱뚝딱 하나씩 고쳐나갔습니다.\n우선 주방에서 주문을 한눈에 볼 수 있는 시스템을 비롯한 음식점에 꼭 필요한 핵심 기능들을 빠르게 채웠어요. 그리고 ‘포스 인텔리전스’라는 홍보 원칙을 명확히 세워 배너 영역을 깔끔하게 정리했죠. 설치와 세팅 과정도 최대한 쉽게 개편해서 사장님들이 대리점의 도움 없이 혼자서 할 수 있게 만들었어요. 다양한 개선 덕분에 이제는 사장님들과 대리점 모두 “토스 포스 덕분에 일이 편해졌다”는 피드백을 주고 계십니다.\n토스포스로 만난 사용자들을 토스 앱으로도 연결시켰어요. ‘나중에 적립 기능’을 통해 매장에서 적립을 놓치더라도 토스앱에서 다시 적립 할 수 있도록 하면서, 매장 고객과 토스 고객이 하나로 이어지는 경험을 만들 수 있었어요. 지금은 수천 개 매장에서 쓰이고 있고, 앞으로 토스포스의 CRM을 한 단계 도약시킬 토대가 되고 있어요.\n집을 잘 고쳤으니 이제 평천하를 향해 나아가야겠죠. 토스포스가 가야 할 위대한 항로는 막 시작되었습니다. ‘같은 깃발 아래에서 우리는 동료’라는 유명한 해적헌장이 있습니다. 앞으로 제휴사와 매장주들과 함께 연대하며 오프라인 비즈니스의 모든 순간을 연결하는 환경을 만들어 갈 거예요. 우리 모두 해적정신으로 단단히 무장했으니, 어떤 파도에도 흔들리지 않고 끝까지 항해할 거라 믿습니다.”\n\n아직도 할 게 있어요?\n— 토스증권 Community Silo 김유경, 최보금\n\n“토스증권 커뮤니티는 빠른 속도로 성장했습니다. 성장의 원동력은 좋은 글을 중심으로 한 ‘플라이휠’ 구조였습니다. 투자자들의 글이 팔로우와 재방문을 만들고, 다시 좋은 글을 낳는 선순환이 굴러가기 시작한 거죠.\n하지만 이 확장이 처음부터 쉬운 건 아니었어요. 종목 토론을 넘어 관심사별로 소통할 수 있는 ‘주제별 커뮤니티’를 출시했지만, 참여는 저조했거든요. 종목 커뮤니티 인기글을 모아보거나, 공식 엠버서더의 좋은 글을 추천탭에 노출시키며 노력했지만 반응은 약했습니다. 생각해보니 저희가 했던 시도들은 사용자와 사용자를 연결하는 게 아니라, 그저 하향식으로 콘텐츠를 전달하는 전통적인 방법이었어요.\n그래서 아예 새로운 시도를 시작해봤어요. 누구나 관심있을 주제를 유저의 글로 던지는 방법이었죠. 투자와 일상을 섞은 글, 투자자자라면 모두가 관심을 가지는 시사 이슈, 가볍게 웃을 수 있는 아무말 대잔치. 이런 콘텐츠에서 사용자들의 활발한 반응이 일어나기 시작했습니다. 그 덕분에 이제는 미국주식을 넘어 국내주식과 코인, 일상 이야기까지 아우르는 커뮤니티로 거듭날 수 있었죠.\n커뮤니티 그로스 루프를 만들기 위해 이제 콘텐츠를 통한 새로운 유저 획득이라는 마지막 퍼즐만 남았습니다. 저희는 유저들의 자발적 공유에서 기회를 발견했어요. 이 기회를 살리기 위해 약관을 개정해 UGC(사용자 생성 콘텐츠)를 외부로 확산할 수 있게 했어요. 이와 함께 광고·파트너십을 통한 배포 전략도 준비하고 있죠.\n이제 다음 학기의 목표는 명확합니다. 유저가 쓴 좋은 글로 계속해서 신규 유저를 불러오고, 팔로우로 재방문을 늘리며, 이를 다시 콘텐츠 투자로 연결하는 완벽한 커뮤니티 그로스 루프를 완성하는 것. 이를 통해 주식 커뮤니티 분야 세계 1위를 향해 나아가보겠습니다.”\n앞으로의 항해\n\n언제나 그랬듯 이번 학기에도 토스에는 수많은 도전이 있었습니다. 때로는 거친 파도를 맞고, 예상치 못한 암초에 부딪히기도 했지만, 그 과정에서 더 단단해질 수 있었어요. 가장 중요한 건 멈추지 않고 계속 유난하게 항해했다는 점이겠죠.\n해적정신이 테마였던 이번 얼라인먼트 기간 내내 <원피스(ONE PIECE)>의 밀짚모자 해적단을 떠올렸어요. 주인공 루피와 동료들은 강한 적을 만나 고전하면서도 결국 똘똘 뭉쳐 이겨내고, 위대한 항로를 나아갑니다. 어느덧 10년이 넘는 항해를 하고 있지만, 여전히 처음처럼 서로를 믿고 의지하며 강해지고 있는 토스 해적단. 앞으로도 우리는 더 큰 바다를 향해 나아갈 것입니다. 원피스를 찾는 그날까지요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 최서윤",
