These updates include support for targeting the Xbox GDK October 2025 update, removing a misleading and outdated output message, and other minor improvements and bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,750 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n82 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n504 ports were updated by December and 584 ports were updated in January. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 15 main triplets.\n182 community contributors made commits.\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 7,300 forks and 26,600 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2025.12.12, 2026.01.16 releases)\nRemoved an outdated output message after running vcpkg upgrade that could mislead users (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1802).\nUpdated vcpkg to understand new layout structure and environment variables for targeting Xbox as of the October 2025 Microsoft GDK update. (PRs: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1834, thanks @walbourn!).\n\nGameDKLatest is associated with the ‘old’ layouts and only exists when they are optionally installed by October 2025 or by earlier GDKs. October 2024 GDK or later are still in-service.\nGameDKXboxLatest is associated with the ‘new’ layouts which are always present for October 2025 or later.\nOther minor improvements and bug fixes.\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\nTriplet\nPorts available\n\n\nx86-windows\n2549\n\n\nx64-windows\n2678\n\n\nx64-windows-release\n2678\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2557\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2614\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1506\n\n\narm64-windows\n2304\n\n\narm64-windows-static-md\n2290\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1475\n\n\narm64-osx\n2484\n\n\nx64-linux\n2688\n\n\narm-neon-android\n2106\n\n\nx64-android\n2167\n\n\narm64-android\n2134\n\n\nx86-windows\n2549\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing a novel approach to enabling cross-device passkey authentication for devices with inaccessible displays (like XR devices).\nOur approach bypasses the use of QR codes and enables cross-device authentication without the need for an on-device display, while still complying with all trust and proximity requirements.\nThis approach builds on work done by the FIDO Alliance and we hope it will open the door to bring secure, passwordless authentication to a whole new ecosystem of devices and platforms.\nPasskeys are a significant leap forward in authentication, offering a phishing-resistant, cryptographically secure alternative to traditional passwords. Generally, the standard cross-device passkey flow, where someone registers or authenticates on a desktop device by approving the action on their nearby mobile device, is done in a familiar way with QR codes scanned by their phone camera.  But how can we facilitate this flow for XR devices with a head-mounted display or no screen at all, or for other devices with an inaccessible display like smart home hubs and industrial sensors? \nWe’ve taken a  novel approach to adapting the WebAuthn passkey flow and FIDO’s CTAP hybrid protocol for this unique class of devices that either lack a screen entirely or whose screen is not easily accessible to another device’s camera. Our implementation has been developed and is now broadly available on Meta Quest devices powered by Meta Horizon OS. We hope that this approach can also ensure robust security built on the strength of existing passkey frameworks, without sacrificing usability, for users of a variety of other screenless IoT devices, consumer electronics, and industrial hardware.\n\nThe Challenge: No Screen, No QR Code\nThe standard cross-device flow relies on two primary mechanisms:\nQR code scanning: The relying party displays a QR code on the desktop/inaccessible device, which the mobile authenticator scans to establish a secure link.\nBluetooth/NFC proximity: The devices use local communication protocols to discover each other and initiate the secure exchange.\nFor devices with no display, the QR code method is impossible. Proximity-based discovery is feasible, but initiating the user verification step and confirming the intent without any on-device visual feedback can introduce security and usability risks. People need clear assurance that they are approving the correct transaction on the correct device.\nOur Solution: Using a Companion App for Secure Message Transport\nScanning a QR code sends the authenticator device a command to initiate a hybrid (cross-device) login flow with a nonce that identifies the unauthenticated device client. But if a user has a companion application – like the Meta Horizon app – that uses the same account as the device we can use that application to pass this same request to the authenticator OS and execute it using general link/intent execution.\nWe made the flow easy to navigate by using in-app notifications to show users when a login request has been initiated, take them directly into the application, and immediately execute the login request.\nFor simplicity, we opted to begin the hybrid flow as soon as the application is opened since the user would have had to take some action (clicking the notification or opening the app) to trigger this and there is an additional user verification step in hybrid implementations on iOS and Android.\nHere’s how this plays out on a Meta Quest with the Meta Horizon mobile app:\n\n1. The Hybrid Flow Message Is Generated\nWhen a passkey login is initiated on the Meta Quest, the headset’s browser locally constructs the same payload that would have been embedded in a QR Code – including a fresh ECDH public key, a session-specific secret, and routing information used later in the handshake. Instead of rendering this information into an image (QR code), the browser encodes it into a FIDO URL (the standard mechanism defined for hybrid transport) that instructs the mobile device to begin the passkey authentication flow.\n2. The Message Is Sent to the Companion App\nAfter the FIDO URL is generated, the headset requires a secure and deterministic method for transferring it to the user’s phone. Because the device cannot present a QR code, the system leverages the Meta Horizon app’s authenticated push channel to deliver the FIDO URL directly to the mobile device. When the user selects the passkey option in the login dialog, the headset encodes the FIDO URL as structured data within a GraphQL-based push notification. \nThe Meta Horizon app, signed in with the same account as the headset, receives this payload and validates the delivery context to ensure it is routed to the correct user. \n3. The Application Sends a Notification of the Login Request\nAfter the FIDO URL is delivered to the mobile device, the platform’s push service surfaces it as a standard iOS or Android notification indicating that a login request is pending. When the user taps the notification, the operating system routes the deep link to the Meta Horizon app. The app then opens the FIDO URL using the system URL launcher and invokes the operating system passkey interface.\nFor users that have the notification turned off or disabled, launching the Meta Horizon app directly will also trigger a query to the backend for any pending passkey requests associated with the user’s account. If a valid request exists (requests expire after five minutes), the app automatically initiates the same passkey flow by opening the FIDO URL.\nOnce the FIDO URL is opened, the mobile device begins the hybrid transport sequence, including broadcasting the BLE advertisement, establishing the encrypted tunnel, and producing the passkey assertion. In this flow, the system notification and the app launch path both serve as user consent surfaces and entry points into the standard hybrid transport workflow.\n4. The App Executes the Hybrid Command\nOnce the user approves the action on their mobile device, the secure channel is established as per WebAuthn standards. The main difference is the challenge exchange timing:\nThe inaccessible device generates the standard WebAuthn challenge and waits.\nThe mobile authenticator, initiates the secure BLE/NFC connection.\nThe challenge is transmitted over this secure channel.\nUpon UV success, the mobile device uses the relevant key material to generate the AuthenticatorAssertionResponse or AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.\nThe response is sent back to the inaccessible device.\nThe inaccessible device then acts as the conduit, forwarding the response to the relying party server to complete the transaction, exactly as a standard display-equipped device would.\nImpact and Future Direction\nThis novel implementation successfully bypasses the need for an on-device display in the cross-device flow and still complies with the proximity and other trust challenges that exist today for cross-device passkey login. We hope that our solution paves the way for secure, passwordless authentication across a wider range of different platforms and ecosystems, moving passkeys beyond just mobile and desktop environments and into the burgeoning world of wearable and IoT devices. \nWe are proud to build on top of the excellent work already done in this area by our peers in the FIDO Alliance and mobile operating systems committed to this work and building a robust and interoperable ecosystem for secure and easy login.\nThe post No Display?

        "pubDate": "Thu, 05 Feb 2026 12:39:51 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Qodana is a static code analysis tool that brings code inspections and quick-fixes from JetBrains IDEs to the realm of continuous integration. It can be run in the cloud, executed from a Docker container, integrated into CI/CD pipelines, or invoked through a JetBrains IDE.\nQodana already offers an impressive suite of inspections, but it is not limited to what comes built in. You can add custom inspections to enforce project specifics and conventions.\nFor example, imagine a project with a specific code convention:\nEach Kotlin class in a service package must have a Service suffix.\nIn this case, com.jetbrains.service.JetComponent would not conform to this convention, while com.jetbrains.service.BrainComponentService would be perfectly fine. In what follows, we’ll build a plugin that implements this inspection, allowing Qodana to enforce this convention in future projects.\nWe can implement this code convention by creating a custom code inspection packaged in a plugin. Qodana plugins are developed just like JetBrains IDE plugins, which is to say we simply need to create an IntelliJ Platform plugin that can be run in Qodana. Here’s a quick overview of the steps we’ll take:\nInitialize the project from the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template.\nAdjust the project properties and plugin descriptor along with necessary dependencies.\nDeclare the local inspection in the plugin descriptor and implement it in Kotlin.\nBuild and package the plugin.\nIn the example playground project, put the plugin artifact into a proper directory.\nAdjust the Qodana configuration file.\nRun Qodana and look at the report!\nPreparing the plugin project\nTo bootstrap the project, visit the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template repository and click the Use this template button to create a plugin repository. Name it classname-inspection-qodana-plugin, copy the project URL, and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. When the project is ready, customize gradle.properties by declaring the pluginGroup, pluginName, and pluginRepositoryUrl as necessary. Remember to click the Sync Gradle Changes floating button to apply the changes. To modify the unique plugin identifier, change the id element in the plugin descriptor plugin.xml.\nDeclaring dependencies\nOur code inspection targets Kotlin classes, so we need to add the Kotlin plugin to the Qodana plugin’s dependencies. The gradle.properties file requires you to declare:\nplatformBundledPlugins = org.jetbrains.kotlin\nIn addition, the plugin descriptor plugin.xml must contain the same bundled Kotlin plugin in its dependencies:\n<depends>org.jetbrains.kotlin</depends>\nAgain, remember to sync Gradle changes by clicking the floating button.\nIn addition, the Kotlin class inspection needs to support the Kotlin K2 Compiler, which has been enabled by default since version 2025.1 of the IntelliJ Platform. In the plugin descriptor, declare the org.jetbrains.kotlin.supportsKotlinPluginMode extension.\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"org.jetbrains.kotlin\">\n    <supportsKotlinPluginMode supportsK2=\"true\" />\n</extensions>\nCreating the code inspection\nThe actual code for any code inspection that targets Kotlin classes requires three steps:\nDeclare a com.intellij.localInspection extension in the plugin descriptor along with the necessary attributes and a fully qualified reference to the implementation class.\nCreate an implementation class, preferably in Kotlin.\nProvide a standalone HTML file with an inspection description, usage guidelines, and an example.\nDeclaring the extension\nAdd the following declaration to the plugin.xml plugin descriptor file:\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <localInspection\n        language=\"kotlin\"\n        implementationClass=\"org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\"\n        enabledByDefault=\"true\"\n        displayName=\"SDK: Discouraged class name\"\n        groupName=\"Kotlin\"\n    />\n</extensions>\nThe language attribute indicates that the inspection applies to Kotlin source code files. It is important to explicitly enable the inspection by default; otherwise, Qodana will not run it. Then provide a human-readable descriptive displayName to be shown in the report and settings. The groupName attribute sets the inspection category that is shown both in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings. Finally, provide a fully qualified name for the implementation class.\nCode inspection source code\nThe Kotlin plugin provides a useful base inspection class for Kotlin inspections: AbstractKotlinInspection. Override the buildVisitor method and provide a PSI visitor instance that traverses the Kotlin class elements in a type-safe way. classVisitor is a convenient DSL-like function that returns this kind of PSI visitor and is invoked on any Kotlin class in the project you’re inspecting.\npackage org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection\n\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemHighlightType\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemsHolder\nimport com.intellij.psi.PsiElementVisitor\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeinsight.api.classic.inspections.AbstractKotlinInspection\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClass\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtVisitorVoid\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.classVisitor\n\nclass ServicePackageClassNameInspection : AbstractKotlinInspection() {\n    override fun buildVisitor(holder: ProblemsHolder, isOnTheFly: Boolean) = classVisitor { klass ->\n        val classNamePsi = klass.nameIdentifier ?: return@classVisitor\n        val classFqn = klass.fqName?.asString() ?: return@classVisitor\n        if (klass.packageLastComponent == \"service\" && !classFqn.endsWith(\"Service\")) {\n            holder.registerProblem(\n                classNamePsi,\n                \"Class name in the 'service' package must have a 'Service' suffix\"\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val KtClass.packageLastComponent: String\n        get() = containingKtFile.packageFqName.shortName().asString()\n}\nThe visitor subclass extracts the fully qualified Kotlin class name, inspects the rightmost package element, and checks the corresponding suffix. Any improper class name is reported to the ProblemsHolder instance with an enclosing class as a PSI element and a human-readable problem description.\nInspection description\nEach local inspection requires a companion description file, represented as HTML. If you use the Create description file ServicePackageClassNameInspection.html quick-fix, a file named src/main/resources/inspectionDescriptions/ServicePackageClassName.html will be created in the proper location. You’ll also have to provide a description that will be shown in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings.\n<html>\n<body>\nReports class names in the <code>service</code> packages that lack the <code>Service</code> suffix.\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<pre><code>\n  package com.example.foo.service\n  class SomeComponent {\n    /* class members */\n  }\n</code></pre>\n</body>\n</html>\nBuild the plugin\nYou’re all set – time to build! Execute the buildPlugin Gradle task and look at the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip artifact available in the Gradle output directory. The JAR file will be used as the primary artifact in the Qodana scan. \nKeep the plugin artifact type in mind\nQodana does not directly support local ZIP plugin artifacts that include additional JAR archives or third-party dependencies. Any plugin needs to be packaged as a single JAR or unzipped into a specific directory.\nRun Qodana on a playground project\nLet’s create a playground project, written in Kotlin, that we can inspect with Qodana now that we’ve extended it with our plugin. To run the Qodana plugin locally, make sure that two software components are available on your system:\nDocker\nQodana CLI\nOur playground project should contain a class called src/main/kotlin/org/intellij/sdk/qodana/service/SomeComponent.kt, which does not follow our code convention, as it does not have the Service suffix. There are two ways to integrate the Qodana plugin into Qodana:\nPublish it on JetBrains Marketplace\nFor quicker turnaround, put the plugin’s JAR artifact into your project’s .qodana directory.\nTo simplify the build, copy the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file from the plugin project to the .qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file in the playground project. Create the .qodana directory, if it does not yet exist. Then extract the archive with your preferred program or tool. Qodana is able to access the plugin in the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection directory.\nIn addition, Qodana needs to be configured to include our custom code inspection. Change the qodana.yaml file in the root directory of the playground project as follows:\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\ninclude:\n  - name: org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\nThe include block needs to refer to the fully qualified class name of the code inspection available in the plugin. Now execute the following command to run Qodana from the terminal:\nqodana scan --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/qodana-code-inspection\nThis will download the corresponding Qodana Docker image. A Docker container will be created and run based on the Qodana configuration. To make the custom plugin accessible inside the Qodana run, mount the Qodana plugin directory from the local filesystem to the appropriate directory inside the Qodana Docker container. After a couple of minutes, Qodana will produce a report summary and print it to the standard output.\nQodana - Detailed summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nAnalysis results: 1 problem detected                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nBy severity: High - 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nName                           Severity  Problems count                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nSDK: Discouraged class name    High      1                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------\nOpen the full report in your browser:\n  Do you want to open the latest report [Y/n]Yes\n\n!  Press Ctrl+C to stop serving the report\n\n\\  Showing Qodana report from http://localhost:8080/... (10s)\nQodana will show that SomeComponent does not conform to the code convention provided by our local inspection in the Qodana plugin.\n\n\n\n\nTips for future runs\nWhen the Qodana plugin is modified and rebuilt, the Qodana cache needs to be recreated as well. In such cases, use the --clear-cache CLI switch to reload all of the Qodana run’s dependencies.\nqodana scan --clear-cache --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.jar:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/codeinspection.jar\nPlugging Qodana into your IDE\nThe Qodana plugin can be installed from disk into the IDE. Its code inspection is then automatically enabled and invoked for any Kotlin class in a project. To check that it’s working, revisit the playground project, open the org.intellij.sdk.qodana.service.SomeComponent class, and make sure that the problematic class name is underlined. As a convenience, hovering the mouse on the class name will show the code inspection result along with the problem description. Alternatively, you can open the Problems tool window and find the problem in the list of all problems reported by code inspections. \nThe code inspection now behaves like any other inspection provided by the IDE. In Settings | Editor | Inspections | Kotlin, you’ll find the SDK: Discouraged class name inspection, along with the description sourced from the HTML file that we provided before.\nRunning Qodana within the IDE\nWith the plugin installed, you can now run Qodana from your IDE as well. In the Problems tool window, go to the Qodana tab, and click the Try Locally button. Qodana will be configured with the qodana.yaml file and run. The Qodana report can be found directly in the tool window. \n\n\n\n\nQodana plugins and JetBrains Marketplace\nProperly built and tested custom inspection plugins can be published on JetBrains Marketplace, removing the need to serve them from the .qodana directory. Instead, you just need to make sure that the Qodana configuration specifies a public plugin identifier that matches the id element in the plugin descriptor.\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\nplugins: \n  - id: com.github.novotnyr.qodanacodeinspection\nQodana’s scan command is simplified, as the .qodana directory mount is no longer necessary.\nqodana scan\nQodana downloads this plugin from JetBrains Marketplace and runs all its inspections, producing both console output and an HTML report that can be shown in a web browser.\nSummary\nWe have created a Qodana plugin with a code inspection that checks for a specific code convention, and we have a handful of ways to run it:\nAs a JAR placed in the .qodana directory and included in the Qodana YAML file.\nAs a reference to the publicly available plugin on JetBrains Marketplace.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is applied in a local Qodana run.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is included among the integrated code inspections. \nSee the IntelliJ SDK Code sample for concise examples of both the Qodana plugin and a playground project",

There are fewer distractions and fewer launches, which makes it the ideal time to slow down and take a look at what is actually driving the tech world at the moment.\nThis issue leans into that calm, with Trisha Gee joining us as our featured content guest and sharing her thoughts and observations on the latest Java news and how it’s shaping developers’ lives. We explore where Java is heading next, what running on the latest LTS really means, and how the platform keeps improving without chasing hype. Add in some practical tutorials, Kotlin updates, AI gradually becoming capable of more and more everyday development tasks, and a few thoughtful takes along the way, and you have a February read that is relaxed in tone, but rich in ideas. \nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha Gee is a Java Champion, author, and internationally recognized speaker with over two decades of experience in software development. Known for her deep expertise in Java, high-performance systems, and developer productivity, Trisha has worked as a developer and leader in organizations ranging from startups to global enterprises. She’s passionate about sharing knowledge and helping developers write more expressive and efficient code.\nTrisha is the author of multiple technical books, including Head First Java (3rd Edition) and Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA, and she frequently contributes to developer communities through blogs, webinars, and international conferences. She’s also a strong advocate for grassroots learning and regularly supports local user groups and meetups to help developers connect, grow, and thrive. When she’s not writing or coding, she’s championing inclusive practices and mentoring the next generation of developers.\nHappy February, dear readers of Java Annotated Monthly! For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the words “Happy” and “February” do not usually go together. However, I do see the upside of the dark months of January and February, mostly in that things are fairly quiet, travel (for me) is usually limited, and it’s a time to take stock of how you want the rest of the year to go.\nSo let’s look at Java (weird, for a Java newsletter). We now know the list of features coming in Java 26. Java 25, the current version, is the latest LTS, so although you may not be ready to look at Java 26 yet, you should be running on Java 25. It’s incredible to me that Java is still evolving after all these years, and in elegant and useful ways. In Data-Oriented Programming for Java: Beyond Records, Brian Goetz talks about how data can best be represented in Java, and specifically what carrier classes are. I’m always fascinated by how the language evolves and how the engineers decide which features to add or update (like records or carrier classes). If you are too, you should watch this interview with Georges Saab. He also talks about the value of learning (I learned fairly recently that “Hello World” in Java is much simpler to write thanks to new language features). Watch Marit demonstrate them in IntelliJ IDEA. And if you are keen to expand your IntelliJ IDEA/JetBrains IDE knowledge to expert level, maybe you’ll be interested in JetBrains’ Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA full-day workshop, which is led by me!\nI mentioned travel earlier in this piece – sadly I will not be going to JavaOne this year, which is super disappointing. JavaOne is where I got started with presenting at conferences, and it’s a place where I always meet interesting people, whether they are speakers, engineers working on Java itself, Java Champions, Java User Group leaders, or attendees there to learn something new. Tickets are still available, so I recommend taking a look.\nThat’s all from me! Remember, February is short, and it’ll be spring soon.\nJava News\nFresh releases, future plans, and the inside story from the Java team.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Today, we’re introducing the JetBrains Console, which provides enhanced AI management and analytics for organizations, including new capabilities to manage, observe, and control AI usage and costs across teams.\nAI is no longer an experiment for most development teams. It’s becoming part of the core toolchain. As usage increases, so does the need for clarity. Leaders need to understand how AI is used, how it affects day-to-day work, and how to manage it responsibly in an organization.\nAs a first step, these new capabilities are designed to provide that clarity, with governance and observability built in from the start. We will continue to further develop AI governance functionalities to provide even greater transparency.\nCentralized AI governance across teams\nOrganizations can now use the JetBrains Console to manage AI usage and costs at the company or team level. In the AI settings section, you can:\nEnable AI on the organization or team level.\nControl access to AI tools and agents, including Junie, Claude Agent, and OpenAI Codex.\nManage a shared pool of AI Credits.\nSet default and per-user credit limits.\nConfigure data collection options.\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce enabled, AI capabilities are available directly inside developers’ JetBrains IDEs, with no additional setup or workflow changes required. This makes it possible to roll out AI incrementally and avoid ungoverned usage.\n\n\n\n\nManaging AI Credits and licenses\nAs AI usage grows, visibility into licenses and consumption becomes critical.\nThe Users and licensing tab in the AI management section provides a single view of:\nLicense availability and assignment throughout the organization.\nIncluded AI Credit usage.\nRemaining top-up credits.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdmins can assign licenses that include AI Credits, such as AI Pro, AI Ultimate, All Products Pack, and dotUltimate, to individual users. Access can be granted or restricted as needed, with changes taking effect immediately.\n\n\n\n\nFor teams or individuals with higher usage needs, additional AI Credit limits can be configured per user or applied in bulk. This allows organizations to support power AI users without removing default values in the company.\n\n\n\n\nObservability into AI usage and adoption\nAI adoption rarely looks the same across teams. Some developers integrate it deeply into their workflow, while others use it occasionally or not at all.\nThe console provides clear visibility into how AI is used throughout the organization, helping you understand adoption patterns and plan budgets better.\nTrack AI adoption and engagement over time\nThe Active AI users chart shows how many developers actively use AI, making it easier to understand adoption trends and engagement levels across teams. You can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nMonitor AI Credit consumption\nAI Credit usage can be analyzed over any time period, both for credits included in your AI license and top-up credits. This data supports more informed planning around budgets and usage limits.\n\n\n\n\nSpot when developers reach their AI Credit limits\nThe console also shows how frequently users reach their monthly AI Credit limits. This makes it easier to identify friction points and adjust limits where needed, whether at the team or individual level.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how AI influences development work\nBeyond usage and cost, the console provides early insights into how AI is used and received by developers. The AI activity and impact charts are intended to support comparison and informed decisions. \nIn upcoming releases, we will introduce more advanced metrics and API access to help organizations assess the impact of AI on engineering and business outcomes.\nAcceptance of AI-generated code\nThe AI-generated code and acceptance rate charts show how often AI-generated code is accepted by developers and act as indicators of quality and relevance.\nYou can use this data to compare the tools or agents you have integrated into AI Assistant (Junie, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and others that will be supported in the future). This helps you identify where suggestions consistently fall short of expectations and decide where configuration, enablement, or tool choice should be revisited. \nYou can find more details on how we calculate these metrics here.\n\n\n\n\nAI-modified code\nThe AI-modified code charts highlight the relative footprint of different AI tools and features within the codebase.\nThis helps teams understand exactly where AI is making meaningful contributions to development.\n\n\n\n\nAI feature activity\nThe AI feature activity chart shows how developers interact with AI inside the IDE, including chat usage and suggestion volume.\nThese insights help distinguish experimentation from sustained use and identify mismatches between enabled capabilities and actual developer behavior.\n\n\n\n\nGet started\nAI management and analytics are now available at no additional cost to all commercial customers with AI licenses via the JetBrains Console. Access is role-based, allowing organizations to define who can manage AI settings, view usage and adoption data, and assign licenses. \nTo get started, open the AI management section in the JetBrains Console. For more details, refer to the documentation or visit the AI for Business page.\n\n\n\n    \nExplore JetBrains Console now\n                                                    \nWe’re working to further enhance AI management and governance capabilities for organizations. Upcoming features include:\nCentralized Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) management for AI providers.\nMCP management for your organization.\nCentralized codebase indexing (RAG).\nAI guardrails and AI audit.\nMore advanced usage analytics dashboards and API access.\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to stay updated on what’s next?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting from version 2026.1, IntelliJ-based IDEs will run natively on Wayland in supported desktop configurations. This follows Wayland’s ascendance to the position of primary display server across contemporary Linux distributions.\nBy making this change in our EAP releases first, we hope to be able to give more Linux users the opportunity to try the native Wayland mode in their IDE, gather their feedback, and prepare more comprehensively for the general rollout in one of the upcoming major versions.\nWhat changes?\nInstead of running as X applications, IntelliJ-based IDEs will now automatically enable native Wayland support in a Wayland-capable desktop environment.\n\n\n\n\nSince the last preview in 2024.2, we have enhanced stability across several Wayland server implementations, added drag-and-drop functionality and input methods (IMs) support, and made a significant step towards native-looking window decorations.\nWayland differs profoundly from X11 in several technical ways. As a result, even though the user interface should largely look and feel the same, these underlying distinctions may be noticeable:\nSome windows and dialogs, e.g. Project Structure and Alerts, may not be centered on the screen or keep their previous location. This is due to the window manager having total control over windows’ locations in Wayland, which it is not always possible to override on the application side.\nThe splash screen on IDE startup will not appear as it cannot be reliably centered on the screen.\nSome popups, such as Search Everywhere and Recent Locations, may not be moved outside of the main frame.\nWindow decorations (such as the title bar, window control buttons, shadows, and rounded corners), where present, may not fully adhere to the current desktop theme.\n\n\n\n\nSome of these distinctions affect many Wayland users across other applications, and the Wayland community is actively addressing them. It is possible that they will be resolved in future versions of Wayland implementations and IntelliJ-based IDEs.\nX11 is still supported\nIn a Linux desktop environment that does not support Wayland, IntelliJ-based IDEs will continue to work as X applications. It is also possible to switch to using X11 on any Wayland desktop because an X.Org implementation called XWayland is always available for compatibility with older applications. To do that, add -Dawt.toolkit.name=XToolkit to the VM options list (Help | Edit Custom VM Options…) and restart the IDE.\nIs my IDE running in X11 or Wayland mode?\nIf you are curious about which mode your IntelliJ-based IDE is currently running in, you can find out by going to the About dialog (Help | About) and checking which toolkit is in use. Click on the Copy and Close button, and you’ll then see the toolkit’s name towards the top of the copied text:\nToolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nThis information is also available in idea.log; for example:\nINFO - #c.i.p.i.b.AppStarter - toolkit: sun.awt.wl.WLToolkit\nConfigurations supported in the future\nWayland support for Remote Development mode is currently a work in progress. In the meantime, Remote Development mode will continue to operate as before and not enable native Wayland support automatically.\nTechnical details\nNative Wayland support is mostly concentrated in one subsystem called WLToolkit. If you were one of the early adopters of this mode, you had to specify the -Dawt.toolkit.name=WLToolkit VM option manually. This will continue to work, but it is no longer necessary.\nThe launcher will supply a new option to the IDE: -Dawt.toolkit.name=auto. The “auto” option will be resolved into either WLToolkit or XToolkit based on the following rule:\nIf wl_display_connect() succeeds, “auto” is replaced with WLToolkit, and therefore the application is launched in the native Wayland mode.\nOtherwise, “auto” is replaced with XToolkit, and the application is launched in X11 mode.\nLike every other aspect of JetBrains Runtime, the platform that powers IntelliJ-based IDEs, WLToolkit is fully open-source. JetBrains is also a key contributor to the OpenJDK project Wakefield, which is dedicated to ensuring that all Java applications execute natively on Wayland. New features and fixes are regularly published to the project’s GitHub repository. \nFeedback\nWe are very grateful for the dedication and valuable input from our users who participated in the Wayland Preview program. The time and effort you invested in reporting issues were instrumental, not only in identifying critical bugs but also in helping us accurately prioritize the roadmap for improvements and the implementation of key features.\nWe are pleased to announce that the upcoming version 2026.1 incorporates fixes for a substantial number of the reported problems. These fixes address a wide range of stability, performance, and desktop integration issues, marking a major milestone in the maturity of our Wayland support.\nThis major platform transition is a work in progress. We are actively investigating and developing fixes, prioritizing core areas like rendering, popups, window management, input methods (IMs), and desktop integration. Please subscribe to and vote for relevant issues for updates. Your patience and feedback are crucial as we work toward a stable, performant, modern, and feature-complete experience.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR:\nThe Kotlin Foundation is launching a mentorship program that pairs experienced open-source maintainers with new Kotlin contributors to help them make their first meaningful contributions, with branded swag and a chance to win a trip to KotlinConf.\nI still remember my first contribution to an open-source library. It was Typhoon, a widely popular dependency injection framework for iOS apps. The easiest part was the actual change. Much harder, but still manageable, was everything that came with it – from onboarding to learning the project structure to figuring out how things were tested.\nWhat required the most effort in terms of emotional energy was something different – deciding that I was worthy of contributing at all. Typhoon was one of the most popular iOS libraries at the time. Most of the apps I knew depended on it. Folks from my community used it daily and considered it a very clever and complex project. I had to convince myself that I was good enough and that I wouldn’t make things worse.\nIronically, I actually did make things worse by introducing a pretty nasty bug. But the world didn’t end. I learned a lot and fixed it later myself!\nThe same thing still happens today to many people who want to make their first open-source contribution. In some ways, it has become even harder, as AI has made the picture worse. It’s now much easier to implement a change without deeply understanding the project and the problem being solved, which has led to a wave of low-quality PRs. As a result, many maintainers have become skeptical about reviewing contributions from outsiders.\nThat’s why we’re launching a new pilot program at the Kotlin Foundation – Kotlin Ecosystem Mentorship. We help experienced project maintainers team up with enthusiasts who want to make their first meaningful contribution, whether that’s code, documentation, or something else. Project maintainers act as mentors. They guide mentees through the full contribution journey – helping to set up the project and understand how the work is organized, reviewing changes, and giving feedback until a contribution is successfully merged. Mentees are expected to work on a real project, ask questions, respond to feedback, and gradually learn how to contribute independently.\nBy the end of the program, each mentor-mentee pair should have at least one meaningful contribution merged into a real project. Ideally, the project also gains a new regular contributor who continues picking up tasks in the future.\nWe’re starting with a small-scale pilot for roughly 10 pairs. It will run from mid-February, when mentor-mentee pairs will be formed, to the beginning of April. We expect it to be relatively lightweight, with mentors spending around 30–60 minutes per week, and mentees around 2–4 hours per week, depending on the task.\nThere’s no formal evaluation at the end. Instead, we’ll collect feedback from both sides. Every pair with a successfully merged meaningful contribution will receive a Kotlin-branded merchandise pack, and one randomly selected pair will win a trip to KotlinConf 2026, with all expenses covered.\nWe know that work on open-source projects is very demanding. The most important asset is people who are motivated to spend some of their time giving back to the ecosystem they rely on. We believe this program can help maintainers pass on not just knowledge but also confidence to a new generation of Kotlin open-source contributors!\nHow to apply\nIf you want to participate as a mentor, please complete this survey. You should be a maintainer of a Kotlin open-source project and be ready to spend some time working with a mentee.\nIf you want to participate as a mentee, please complete this survey.\nFAQ\nQ: What are the requirements for mentees?\nWe don’t impose any hard requirements beyond your willingness to contribute to a project. That said, the program is limited in size, so we unfortunately won’t be able to accept everyone this time.\nQ: Is this limited to code contributions?\nWe accept what we call meaningful contributions – anything that a project maintainer (acting as a mentor) considers valuable for their project. This can include documentation, tooling, examples, or other forms of contribution.\nQ: When will the pairs be formed?\nWe’ll get in touch with participants by February 16, 2026.\nQ: Where can I get more details?\nFeel free to contact us at hello@kotlinfoundation.org or join the #kotlin-foundation channel in the public Kotlin Slack.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We hope you’re staying up to date with our latest posts and have checked out our tutorials on how to create coding agents in Koog and connect ACP-compliant agents to your JetBrains IDE. As useful as these guides are, one important piece was hitherto missing from the puzzle: How do you make your Koog agent ACP-compliant in the first place?\nThis is where Koog’s native integration with the ACP comes into play, providing a streamlined path from agent implementation to IDE integration. Let’s review some basics first.\nWhat is the ACP?\nThe Agent Client Protocol (ACP) is an open protocol that defines how agents and clients communicate. Its main uses include notifying the client about things like an LLM’s response or a tool call, or requesting permissions to edit a file. \nACP provides extensive documentation and SDKs for Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, and Rust, all of which fully implement the agent-client communication layer. As a result, developers don’t need to reimplement protocol logic; they can simply use the already-implemented notifications and request handlers.\nThis significantly reduces the effort required to integrate agents with clients and makes interoperability the default: Any ACP-compatible agent can be used with any ACP-compatible editor or client. Several existing coding agents already follow the ACP and can be easily connected with a wide range of clients, including AI Chat in JetBrains IDEs.\nSo if you want to build your own coding or code-related agent and connect it to an IDE, the first step is choosing an agent framework. And a perfect choice here is Koog.\nWhat is Koog?\nKoog is a Kotlin-based framework for building AI agents that targets JVM, Android, iOS, WebAssembly, and in-browser applications. It’s suitable for any kind of agent and provides various ready-made components, including:\nMultiple agent strategies and execution patterns.\nSupport for various LLM providers.\nAgent tracing and state persistence.\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) and A2A (Agent2Agent protocol) integration.\nA feature mechanism to make the agent extensible.\nWhat’s more, our recent Koog blog post series walks through the entire process of building coding agents from prompt design to tool implementation, making it an excellent starting point for getting familiar with the framework. With that foundation in place, we can now take the next step: applying Koog’s agent-building capabilities to create an ACP-compliant agent.\nHow Koog and ACP work together?\nKoog x ACP integration is built on top of the ACP Kotlin SDK and implemented using Koog’s feature mechanism.\nThe Kotlin ACP SDK provides an API for defining an ACP-compatible agent and for declaring the logic of agent instantiation and execution. \nFirst is AgentSupport, which manages client-agent sessions:\nclass KoogAgentSupport: AgentSupport {\n\n    override suspend fun initialize(clientInfo: ClientInfo): AgentInfo {\n    \t// Client establishes connection with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun createSession(sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client creates a new interactive session with the agent\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun loadSession(\n        sessionId: SessionId,\n        sessionParameters: SessionCreationParameters,\n    ): AgentSession {\n    \t// Client loads a previous interactive session with the agent\n    }\n}\nThe createSession method must return an AgentSession, which represents a single client-agent interaction. The session begins when the client sends a prompt request, triggering agent execution:\nclass KoogAgentSession(\n    override val sessionId: SessionId,\n) : AgentSession {\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Client sends prompt, agent starts execution and emits notification into the events flow, which are sent back to client\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        // Agent stops execution\n    }\nNow, let’s build a simple Koog coding agent that can read and edit files directly in your project from the IDE. The place to define and run the agent is the prompt method in AgentSession:\n    private var agentJob: Deferred<Unit>? = null\n\n    override suspend fun prompt(\n        content: List<ContentBlock>,\n        _meta: JsonElement?\n    ): Flow<Event> = channelFlow {\n        // Define config with agent prompt and model of your choice\n        val agentConfig = AIAgentConfig(\n            prompt = prompt(\"acp\") {\n                system(\"You are coding agent.\")\n            // NB: append client prompt\n            }.appendPrompt(content),\n            model = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT4o,\n            maxAgentIterations = 1000\n        )\n\n        // Register file system tools\n        val toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n            tool(::listDirectory.asTool())\n            tool(::readFile.asTool())\n            tool(::editFile.asTool())\n        }\n\n       // Implement your custom agent strategy\n       val strategy = strategy<Unit, Unit>(\"acp-agent\") {\n            val executePlan by subgraphWithTask<Unit, Unit> {\n                \"Execute the task.\"\n            }\n            nodeStart then executePlan then nodeFinish\n        }\n\n       // Combine everything and run\n       val agent = AIAgent<Unit, Unit>(\n            promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n            agentConfig = agentConfig,\n            strategy = strategy,\n            toolRegistry = toolRegistry,\n        ) {\n            // NB: add ACP feature\n            install(AcpAgent) {\n                this.sessionId = this@KoogAgentSession.sessionId.value\n                this.protocol = this@KoogAgentSession.protocol\n                this.eventsProducer = this@channelFlow\n                // To allow default notifications about basic llm and tool events\n                this.setDefaultNotifications = true\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // To make sure the agent is cancellable, wrap it in a job\n        agentJob = async { agent.run(Unit) }\n        agentJob?.await()\n    }\n\n    override suspend fun cancel() {\n        agentJob?.cancelAndJoin()\n    }\nHaving AgentSupport and AgentSession implemented, it becomes possible to execute a Koog agent in ACP mode. Try it using the terminal client – you can find an example implementation here.\nBut now let’s move on and try to connect this Koog coding agent to some ACP-capable client, for example, your IntelliJ-based IDE.\nHow to connect the Koog ACP agent to your IDE?\nAll IntelliJ-based IDEs support the ACP. This means you can connect any ACP-compatible agent and use it directly via the AI Chat.\nWhen a new AI Assistant chat is opened, the IDE instantiates the configured ACP agent and connects to it via the built-in ACP client using standard I/O transport. The client processes all notifications and requests emitted by the running agent, displaying them in the chat and reflecting permission requests directly in the IDE UI.\nAn ACP agent can be connected to the 25.3 version of IntelliJ-based IDEs via the ~/.jetbrains/acp.json config file, where the agent run command, arguments, and environment variables should be defined in JSON format:\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to create an agent executable is to package it as an application. To do this, we place the agent entry point in a separate AcpAgentKt file, where STDIO transport is initialized. This transport captures the process’s standard input and output streams and launches the agent connected to the transport, using the previously defined KoogAgentSupport.\nsuspend fun main() = coroutineScope {\n    val token = System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\") ?: error(\"OPENAI_API_KEY env variable is not set\")\n\n    val agentTransport = StdioTransport(\n        this, Dispatchers.IO,\n        input = BufferedInputStream(System.`in`).asSource().buffered(),\n        output = BufferedOutputStream(System.out).asSink().buffered(),\n        name = \"koog-agent\"\n    )\n\n    val promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(token)\n\n    try {\n        val agentJob = launch {\n            val agentProtocol = Protocol(this, agentTransport)\n\n            Agent(\n                agentProtocol,\n                KoogAgentSupport(\n                    protocol = agentProtocol,\n                    promptExecutor = promptExecutor,\n                    clock = Clock.System,\n                )\n            )\n\n            agentProtocol.start()\n        }\n        agentJob.join()\n\n    } finally {\n        agentTransport.close()\n        promptExecutor.close()\n    }\n}\nUsing Gradle, configure the application entry point, then run the installDist task to generate the executable distribution in projectRoot/build/install/coding-agent/bin/coding-agent.\napplication {\n    mainClass = \"ai.coding.agent.AcpAgentKt\"\n}\nProvide this path in the IDE ACP configuration JSON – and voilà! You can now connect your Koog agent to the AI chat and send prompts directly from the UI…and let the agent code for you!\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nYou can find a complete example of the ACP × Koog coding agent here and use it as a template for building your own in-IDE and external assistants. You can implement an agent for any existing ACP-compatible client or build your own client using the ACP SDKs.\nWith the ACP, Koog, and just a few lines of code, you can connect your agent to your web page or desktop application, receive notifications about the agent lifecycle, and surface them directly in the UI.

This month is about tightening core workflows, improving agent stability, and building on the MCP foundations we’ve been laying.\nThese are active areas of work, not delivery commitments. Upvote the features that matter most to you.\n\nAgent Mode & Coding Agents\nReliability is the priority this month. We’re raising the floor on agent-driven scenarios with:\nBetter progress and status indicators during long-running operations\nImproved handling of failures and retries so agents can recover more gracefully\nDiagnostics and logging improvements to help you diagnose and resolve issues faster.\nUX improvements across chat management, history, and agent-mode interactions\nAdding support for Agent Skills\nCoding Agent & Unified Sessions\nPlanning Agent\nFirst steps toward a dedicated agent for multi-step task planning and execution.\nDedicated Planning Agent built in\nCopilot SDK & Platform Integration (Experimental)\nWe’re also beginning early work to better integrate the Copilot CLI into Visual Studio Copilot.\nWays to surface the Copilot SDK’s harness/ CLI more directly in the IDE\nModel Context Protocol (MCP)\nMCP keeps external tools and services connected to VS in a governed, scalable way. February focus:\nClient ID Metadata Documents (CIMD)\nVisual Studio enables governance for MCP servers\nModels & Context Management\nUnder-the-hood work to keep Copilot fast as context grows:\nBetter handling of large or complex context\n Simplifying how context is reduced and capped to avoid unexpected behavior\nCopilot experience in Editor\nSmoother Copilot integration with existing editor behavior:\nCopilot keyboard shortcut to accept suggestion.\nAvoid IntelliSense and Copilot conflicts \nEasier Copilot support from editor quick info\nWe’re excited for you to try these improvements as they roll out. As always, feedback is incredibly important—please upvote or comment on the linked Developer Community items so we know what matters most to you.\nThanks for continuing to build with us.\nThe post Roadmap for AI in Visual Studio (February) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you use editor productivity extensions for Visual Studio 2026, there’s good news—they can now load faster! Extension developers with existing MEF-based editor productivity extensions should read this blog to learn about recent changes and how they might be affected. \nWe introduced VisualStudio.Extensibility to simplify the creation of Visual Studio extensions for developers. Previously, handling threads in VSSDK-based extensions was often difficult, requiring knowledge of thread affinity and even the ins and outs of COM just to avoid freezing Visual Studio. The new extensibility model abstracts these technical details away seamlessly. \nDespite this advancement, we recognize most Visual Studio extensions still use VSSDK, so we’re striving to make targeted improvements there as well – especially regarding performance. For Visual Studio 2026, we’ve added the ability to load MEF-based editor extensions on a background thread, which significantly speeds up startup times for users. A major highlight of Visual Studio 2026 is its improved performance, and the proposed change we’re making to MEF is just one of many enhancements planned to make it even faster. We hope you’ll be pleased with the results. \nWhat changed? \nVisual Studio editor components use the Managed Extensibility Framework (MEF), which requires that objects be constructed in a free-threaded manner. Despite official MEF guidelines, we’ve often loaded components on the UI thread, resulting in many extensions relying on this behavior and limiting our ability to enhance startup performance. \nWith Visual Studio 2026, we’re shifting to a free-threaded model, loading MEF components on background threads. This means extensions with UI thread dependencies might fail to load. We’ve been rigorously testing this approach in recent Visual Studio 2022 updates, and we are aware that some extensions that expect to load on the UI thread will fail to load with this optimization. To support extension developers through this transition, we’ve provided a setting and an analyzer that allows you to experiment with background loading and detect if your extension could be impacted by this change before we push it out more broadly. This initiative reflects our commitment to reducing disruptive changes and help extenders adapt when updates are necessary for the overall improvement of the product. \nDoes it impact my extension? \nTo help extension developers better detect if this change impacts you, we created an analyzer to identify potential issues. We hope that this will give you the opportunity to bring your extension in compliance with MEF rules, so that your extension can also get a startup performance boost like the rest of Visual Studio 2026. \nThe example below shows the analyzer running and reporting access to the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Shell.ThreadHelper  and DTE2.StatusBar require UI thread. \n \n To use the analyzer, add a reference to the latest version of the Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers package: \n<PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.VisualStudio.SDK.Analyzers\" Version=\"17.7.98\" PrivateAssets=\"all\" />\nTo validate your extension can adapt to this change, enable the Preview Feature flag “Initialize editor parts asynchronously during solution load”. \n \nWhen debugging, you may set a breakpoint in MEF part constructors and evaluate System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId. If it’s different than 1, then your code executes on the background thread.  \n \nCall to action \nLoading MEF parts on a background thread is essential for improving Visual Studio’s performance, and we have gradually enabled this change in Visual Studio 2026. We recognize that code changes can be inconvenient, so we’ve made it straightforward to spot and resolve any issues. To see examples of removing UI thread affinity, please see our documentation or a sample PR on how we made this change ourselves.  \nWe want to hear from you! \nThank you for sharing your issues and suggestions with us, and we hope you’ll keep providing feedback about what you like and what we can improve in Visual Studio. For those new and experienced to extending Visual Studio, we invite you to visit our documentation to learn more, or watch the video series on Visual Studio Toolbox where Visual Studio engineers take you through how to build extensions using our samples on GitHub. Feel free to share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones. If you want a closer engagement with other partners in the ecosystem, please visit our GitHub repo to report issues as well. \nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn. \nThe post Performance improvements to MEF-based editor productivity extensions appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

POE 1 용병 리그\n용켓몬만으로도 너무 재밌었고, 역저항 날먹이 되다보니 탱도 되는 역저항으로 대동단결이 조금 아쉬웠지만, 디아 2부터 있던 용병으로 인한 2개의 템 세팅의 조합으로 인한 재미는 너무나 좋았다.\n    \n2달 가까이 돌았던 스발린 런에서 스발린을 못먹은건 아쉽지만…\n패시브 트리를 못찍음에도, 여러 버프만으로 오라봇을 통한 빌드까지 돌아가는 과정이 재밌었다\n본 서버 편입 예정이라고 들었는데, 역저항만 잘 막아도 꽤나 재밌는 기재가 많았던 만큼 재미를 크게 더 해줄수 있을 거란 기대가 된다.\n    \n2. POE 2 바알의 운명 리그\nPOE1 불길의 수호자 리그에서의 삿된 아이템 (고유템에서 특정 옵션 하나를 대체한 변성 아이템)에서 조금 더 틀어서, 확률이 더 들어갔고, 더블 커럽 (타락 2번으로, 홈 변경, 수치 변경, 옵션 부여가 최대 2번 가능)이 POE1 보다 편하게 도입되면서 재밌는 아이템이 많이 나왔다\n    \n물론 POE1보다 제한이 많은 역냉각, 그나마 공격은 흡수라도 되지만 주문 스킬 사용 시 코스트 제한이 큰 POE2의 제약을 풀어주는 계약 갑옷의 함양 옵션은 블러 메이지 어센던시가 얼마나 사기였는지 알 수 있었다.\n무한 불가능한 탈출, 히든 패시브 스킬 트리의 오라클도 재밌었고, 곰, 늑대, 와이번 드루이드도 꽤 재밌게 즐겼다.\n바알 사원이 POE1의 고난 리그 못지 않은 도파민 리그였고, 이를 막으려다가 롤백하는 등 사소한 이슈들이 있었지만, 역시 핵슬은 도파민이 리그 흥행에 도움이 된다는 것을 다시 한번 느끼게 됐다.\n    \n3. 디아블로 4 시즌 10\n오픈 베타 이후 아쉬움을 느껴 POE를 시작했고 라스트 에포크를 즐겼지만, 워낙 여러 영상에서 극찬이 많던 시즌이라 나도 즐기게 됐다.\n확실히 액트 구간을 빠르게 넘길 수 있고, 이로 인해 엔드 게임을 빠르게 진입할 수 있는 것은 장점이었지만, 직관적이고 빠르게 적응 가능한 시스템들도 많았던 데에 비해, 위상 같은 것은 번거롭기만 한 느낌도 지울 수 없었다.\n비약 같은 시스템은 MMORPG같은 느낌이 드는 버프도 있었는데, 또 어떤 부분은 핵슬의 기본 문법 스러운 포인트도 있고해서 나름 재밌게 즐겼다\n아이템 거래가 불편한 것만 아니었다면 좀 더 재밌게 즐겼을 듯\n    \n제발 거래소 좀..\n지향점 자체가 라이트한 핵앤 슬래시라는 게 느껴지긴 했으나, 그래도 좀 더 파고들기 요소가 있어야 되지 않을까?\n    \n올해의 워스트 게임\n1. POE 2 사냥의 서막\nPOE2 얼리억세스의 좋은 기세에 찬물을 끼얹은 시즌\n액트 시간이 단축되는 것을 못마땅하게 여겼는지, 가뜩이나 어렵던 액트 구간을 더 어렵게 만들었고, 이 과정에서의 이탈했고 나 역시 모든 POE2 시즌 중 일주일 남짓에 오프한 리그\n    \n특히 워리어 계열이 크게 고통 받았는데, 여러가지 반발이 많았고 이로 인해 허리띠에 호신부 슬롯 기본 부여, 전직 변경 가능을 비롯한 여러가지 개선이 이뤄진 전화위복 시즌이었다\n번개창으로 대동단결된 시즌이라, 시원시원하게 재밌게 즐긴 분도 많았겠지만, 시즌제 게임에서 초반이 얼마나 중요한지, 그 대응의 중요성도 느꼈던 시즌\n    \n2. 풋볼 매니저 26\n아직 버그가 너무 많다\n새로운 게임이 된 거 같지만, 잘 정돈되지 않은 느낌은 크게 아쉬웠음\n    \n할만은 하지만, 할만한 정도론 이전 버전을 플레이 하는게 낫지 않나 싶은 생각이 들었음\n        \n3. 몬스터 헌터 와일즈\n내가 굳이 언급하지 않아도 알겠지만, 여러 이슈로 인해 확장팩만 기다리는 사람이 산더미인 게임\n과연 확장팩에선 개과천선할 수 있을까?\n기억에 남는 게임\n1. 라스트 에포크 시즌 2, 3\n사실 아직 많이 모자르다\n    \n그래도 같은 직업군 내의 패시브를 혼합해서 찍을 수도 있고, 기본적 게임의 틀은 잘 완성된 형태여서 재밌게 즐겼다\n시즌 중에 발생한 거래소 한글 버그가 고쳐지지 않은 문제나, 패치마다 발생하는 소소한 버그가 너무 늦게 고쳐지는 이슈, 시즌 2 -3 간격도 빠른 편이라 보긴 어렵지만, 1-2의 간격, 3-4의 간격은 지나치게 길다는 점, 시즌 컨텐츠 양이 부족하다는 점 등은 아쉽다\n엔드 게임이 디아4보다는 풍부하지만 부족함이 많고, 컨텐츠 역시 갈길이 먼 측면이 있으며, 플레이 타임을 유지하기 위해서인지 한번 사용된 아이템은 각인되는데, 이로 인해 반복 노가다와 득템의 효율이 조금 아쉽다\n총평하자면 포텐은 증명했으나, 용이 되지 못했고, 발표한 플랜도 아쉬움이 크다.\n    \n그럼에도 관심을 놓자니 미련이 남는 게임\n        \n2. 토치 라이트 인피니트 SS10\n핵슬에 대한 이해도를 높일 겸사 겸사 시작했던 게임\n    \n널리 알려진거에 비해서 무료 캐릭으로 무료로 즐겨도 할만했음\n그래픽의 호불호는 나도 좀 있긴했지만, 생각보다 완성도 높은 게임이라서 놀라웠음\n왜 이 게임을 POE 다음 가는 수준의 깊이 있는 게임이라고 말하는지는 충분히 알았고, 이후에도 종종 타이밍 맞으면 즐길 게임\n    \n3. 엘더 스크롤 4 오블리비언 리마스터\n사실 원작이 발매됐던 시기에도 엑박버전이나 스팀 버전 등 여러번 샀음에도, 적응을 못하고 넘어갔었다\n이후 스카이림을 재밌게 즐겼으나, 굳이 구작을 즐기지 않았었는데 이번에 리마스터가 되면서 즐기게 됐다.\n아니 이런 명작을 놓쳤다니…? 이래서 오블리비언 오블리비언 얘기가 나왔고, 엘더 스크롤이 메이저 게임으로 한국에도 퍼진 계기였구나 싶은 감탄이 나왔던 게임\n올해의 영상\n1. 서울 자가에 대기업 다니는 김부장 이야기\n그 감정선이나 묘사가 너무 재밌었음\n나 역시 나이가 들어가는 입장에서 많이 공감되어야 하는거 아니냐고 말할 수도 있지만, 약간 과장되었거나, 공감이 안되는 내용이 꽤 있었다\n하지만 드라마로써의 완성도나 만족도는 충분했음\n    \n2. 중증외상센터\n여러 의학 드라마의 무게감보다 훨씬 명확하고 명쾌해서 좋았다\n    \n중증 외상 센터가 왜 필요한지에 대해서 알 수 있던 점은 덤\n깔끔한 전개로 즐겁게 볼 수 있었던 드라마\n    \n3. 경도를 기다리며\n오징어 게임의 세미역으로 나왔던 원지안 배우가 여주인공이었는데, 아주 매력적으로 나왔다\n약간 디테일은 많이 다르지만, 그 해 우리는 의 김다미 배우처럼, 작품과 딱 맞아떨어져 매력적으로 보였던 작품\n의외로 이런 저런 전개 과정이 멜로나, 로맨틱 코메디보다 재밌게 볼 수 있는 부분이 많아서 좋았다다\n올해의 아쉬운 드라마\n1. 오징어 게임 2, 3\n군계 일학이라 하나만 꼽겠음\n이유는 굳이 말 안해도 많은 사람들이 알거라 생각하지만…\n    \n무언가 기간 부족인지 1에 비해 떨어지는 디테일이 공감, 감정 이입을 방해했다\n        \n올해의 음악\n1. 프로미스 나인 - 하얀 그리움\n[fromis_9 (프로미스나인) - White Memories (하얀 그리움)\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251206방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyVxWRjSco&list=RDfXyVxWRjSco&start_radio=1)\n        \n알아듣기 힘든 노래 속에, 옛날 김민종님의 90-00 감성이 살아나는 노래를 잘 살렸다\n2. NMIXX - Blue Valentine\n[NMIXX (엔믹스) - Blue Valentine\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251018방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnUNpf0sgFE&list=RDVnUNpf0sgFE&start_radio=1)\n        \n이 노래 역시, 하얀 그리움처럼 잘 알아들을 수 있고 겨울 감성 살아있는 설레임 가득한 느낌이 드는 음악이어서 좋았다\n3. Behind the Moon - 밤의 끝자락\n밤의 끝자락 (Official Audio)\n시티팝? J-POP? 스러운 감성의 노래였는데 감성적으로 취향 저격이었음\n다만 Behind the Moon의 노래중 이 노래가 특히 좋았다는 점은 조금 아쉬웠음\n    \n김수영처럼 많은 노래가 비슷하게 취향 저격이었음 좋았을텐데…\n올해의 기술 주제\n1. LLM 쇼크, 바이브 코딩\nLLM의 발전이 기대보다 빠르게 진행되고 있다\n바이브 코딩과 함께 일정 수준 이하의 단순한 작업은 코드를 작성하지 않고도 가능해진 점은, 여러 분야의 생산성을 극대화 시킬 수 있는 부분이라고 보여진다\n물론 여전히 한계도 많고, 그 퀄리티의 제약도 많은 것은 당연한데, 이렇게 진행되다보면 개발자 무용론이 더 심해지지 않을까 우려도, 또 한편으로는 기회일 수도 있다는 생각도 든다\n    \n또 더 성장해야 된다는 생각 역시 들고 말이다\n        \n2. 메모리 가격 쇼크\n이게 왜 기술 주제냐하실 수 있는데, 메모리가 비싸지면 PC 시장이나, 서버 시장에도 영향을 줘서라고 말하고 싶다\n메모리 가격이 몇배씩 뛰면서, 게이머들의 PC 업그레이드 저항감은 더 커졌다\n    \n심지어 맥미니가 가성비라는 말 (원래도 어느정돈 그랬지만)이 더 공감을 얻고 있는데, 이러한 램 가격은 한동안 내려오지 않을 듯 하다\nSSD도 가격 인상중인데, 이 영향이 얼마나 커질까?\n또 게이머 관점에서도, 게임 개발자 관점에서도 PC 보급의 저항감이 낮아진 것은 우려가 되는 것은 사실이다\n    \n3. PostgreSQL의 강세, MySQL의 약세\n이러한 흐름은 몇년이나 지속 됐지만, 그 흐름이 더 커지는 명확한 시그널이 느껴진다\n오라클이 MySQL 커뮤니티, 개발을 유지할지에 대한 우려가 더 커지는 상황이 나오고 있고, 반면 PostgreSQL은 더 발전이 가속화 되는 상황이 이어지며, 이 흐름이 한국에서 얼마나 영향을 줄 지 궁금해진다.\n올해의 글\n1. AWS 버지니아 DDB 장애\nSummary of the Amazon DynamoDB Service Disruption in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region\n    \n실제 내가 서비스중인 프로덕트도 영향을 받았고, 이외에도 많은 제품이 영향을 받아 어떤 제품들이 AWS를 쓰고 있는지 알 수 있었음\n원인을 잘 설명해주긴 했으나, 결국 과도하게 복잡해진 시스템은 작은 오류도 복구가 쉽지 않아진다는 점은 크게 공감할 수 있었다\n        \n2. LLM과 함께라면 3달이 3일\nMariano Gappa’s Blog\n    \n사실 나 역시 토이 프로젝트나, 프로토타이핑 개발 시 단순한 기능의 구현이 떠오르지 않아 시간을 많이 소모한 일이 적지 않았다\n예를 들면, 그리드 기반 게임에서의 AStar라던지, 서버에서의 연산을 위한 경량 Raycast라던지, 투사체의 궤도라던지와 같은 로직들은 어떠한 동작을 원할 때 기능을 찾거나, 직접 구현하는 과정에서 많은 시간을 소모했다\n반면 이러한 수준의 작업은 아주 아주 쉬워진 상황이 나에게도 체감이 되고 있다.\n물론 상대적으로 게임은 바이브 코딩으로 최종 결과물이 안나오는 경우가 꽤 되지만, 이 역시 많이 해소 되고 있고, 더 가속화 될 거 같다.\n        \n다만 재미를 찾는 것은 여전히 사람의 영역이므로 이 부분에 경쟁력이 더 중요해져 가고 있다는 생각도 들었다\n            \n3. LLM 사용을 줄인 이유\nWhy I’m Dialing Back My LLM Usage — Zed’s Blog\n    \n요약하자면 보조적인 용도로 LLM을 써야 한다는 의미\n        \n나 역시 비슷한 의견을 가지고 있긴 하지만, 조금 더 그 생각을 명확히 드러내준 글이라고 볼 수 있겠다\nWhy I stopped using AI code editors · Luciano Nooijen\n    \n비슷한 의견\n        \nLLM을 사용하면 깊이 있는 생각과 통찰은 못 얻는 아쉬움을 대체하기 위해서, 기준을 정하고 사용한다는 의미\n            \n바이브 코딩으로 얻는 장단점을 명확하게 말한 듯 하다\n새해 바램\n건강\n다른 곳은 그래도 좀 괜찮았는데, 수면 장애랑 목이 너무 아프다\n    \n이 부분을 주기적으로 병원 가서 치료 받고 있지만, 아직은 좀 아파서 신경 쓰이는 상황\n        \n강아지\n초코가 그래도 많이 안아팠다\n    \n특히 돈은 많이 들어가고 있지만, 건강을 잘 챙기고 있게 되서 다행이다\n올해도 괜찮길\n파이는 여전히 건강하다\n    \n살만 안찌면 그래도 괜찮을 듯\n        \n여가 생활\n핵앤슬래시에 대한 이해가 크게 올라온 한해였다\n    \n대다수의 메이저 핵앤 슬래시를 모두 어느정도 수준까지 이해할 수 있게 됐다\n핵앤 슬래시 토이 프로젝트로 이어보고 싶은 개인적 바램이 있다\n        \n마치며\n매년 그렇듯, 건강도 잘 챙기고, 업무적 성취도 잘 이루고 싶다\n특히 매년 노력해온 건강, 토이 프로젝트와 함께 가족과의 시간도 더 잘 보내고 싶다\n핵앤 슬래시 게임을 로직적으로나 기획적으로는 어느정도 엿볼 수 있는 제품을 만들어보고 싶다\n다들 건강 잘 챙기시길!",

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `<Activity />` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등 v19에서 도입된 주요 기능들입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 ways to build forms in react (without any libraries)](https://reactpractice.dev/articles/3-ways-to-build-forms-in-react)\r\r\n* [Building Reusable Components with

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다. Vercel에서 호스팅된 앱은 자체적으로 방어하고 있었다는 점에서 의문이 들기도 했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n일부 개발자들은 타 호스팅 업체들이 Next.js의 모든 기능을 지원하는 데 어려움을 겪고 있다고 지적했습니다. Next.js가 공식 어댑터를 제공하지 않는 점, 보안 취약점 대응에 소극적이었던 점도 비판의 대상이 됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 Next.js는 Turbopack, React Compiler, PPR 등을 탑재한 v16을 릴리스하며 업데이트를 이어가고 있고 여전히 긍정적인 시선도 존재합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 보안 취약점\r\r\n\r\r\n미들웨어 인증 우회 취약점입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Next.js and the corrupt middleware: the authorizing artifact](https://zhero-web-sec.github.io/research-and-things/nextjs-and-the-corrupt-middleware)\r\r\n* [CVE-2025-29927: Authorization Bypass in Next.js Middleware](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f82v-jwr5-mffw)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 셀프 호스팅과 배포\r\r\n\r\r\nVercel 외 환경에서의 Next.js 운영과 셀프 호스팅 가이드입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Deploying a Next.js App to Production in any server](https://www.saybackend.com/blog/04-deploy-nextjs-to-production-without-vercel)\r\r\n* [How we run Next.js today -

Rust 전환 시 기존 대비 10-100배의 성능 향상이 가능하기 때문에, 복잡해진 프론트엔드 생태계에서 이 흐름은 이제 거스르기 어려워 보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n가장 두드러진 성과를 내는 곳은 VoidZero로 보입니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다. '이게 좋다' 하면 모두가 몰려가고, '저게 정답이다' 하면 또 그쪽으로 쏠리는 흐름이 반복됐습니다. 그 와중에 인상 깊었던 LLM 사용 사례와 아티클, 도구를 정리해 공유합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI 코딩의 한계와 책임\r\r\n\r\r\nLLM 기반 개발의 한계점과 개발자 책임에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to \"write better code?\"](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/)\r\r\n* [Why you shouldn't use AI to write documentation](https://zeroheight.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-use-ai-to-write-documentation/)\r\r\n* [Why Your AI Coding Assistant Keeps Doing It Wrong, and How To Fix It](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/05/22/why-your-ai-coding-assistant-keeps-doing-it-wrong-and-how-to-fix-it/)\r\r\n* [Your job is to deliver code you have proven to work](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/18/code-proven-to-work/)\r\r\n* [dead framework theory](https://aifoc.us/dead-framework-theory/)\r\r\n* [How to Fix Any Bug](https://overreacted.io/how-to-fix-any-bug/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 기업 도입 사례\r\r\n\r\r\nSpotify, Airbnb 등 대규모 조직의 AI 도입 경험입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [1,500+ PRs Later: Spotify’s Journey with Our Background Coding Agent (Part 1)](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2025/11/spotifys-background-coding-agent-part-1)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Accelerating Large-Scale Test Migration with LLMs](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/accelerating-large-scale-test-migration-with-llms-9565c208023b)\r\r\n\r\r\n### MCP와 컨텍스트 엔지니어링\r\r\n\r\r\nModel Context Protocol과 효과적인 AI 활용을 위한 컨텍스트 설계입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [MCP explained without hype of fluff](https://blog.nilenso.com/blog/2025/05/12/mcp-explained-without-hype-or-fluff)\r\r\n* [Chrome DevTools MCP Server](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-devtools-mcp)\r\r\n* [Getting AI to Work in Complex Codebases](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md)\r\r\n* [Minification isn't obfuscation - Claude Code proves it](https://martinalderson.com/posts/minification-isnt-obfuscation-claude-code-proves-it/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### AI시대의 개발 방법론\r\r\n\r\r\nAPI 설계, 문서화, 추상화 등 AI와 함께하는 개발 방법론입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to Design APIs for an AI World ](https://refactoring.fm/p/how-to-design-apis-for-an-ai-world)\r\r\n* [Writing documentation for AI: best practices](https://docs.kapa.ai/improving/writing-best-practices/)\r\r\n* [The New Calculus of AI-based Coding](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html)\r\r\n* [Conversation: LLMs and Building Abstractions](https://martinfowler.com/articles/convo-llm-abstractions.html)\r\r\n* [Attention Is the New Big-O](https://alexchesser.medium.com/attention-is-the-new-big-o-9c68e1ae9b27/)\r\r\n\r\r\n### 유용한 도구\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 개발에 활용할 수 있는 도구입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [repomix](https://github.com/yamadashy/repomix) - 전체 Repository를 AI 친화적인 단일 파일로 압축\r\r\n* [repo2txt](https://github.com/abinthomasonline/repo2txt) - GitHub Repository를 단일 텍스트로 변환, GUI 기반으로 파일 선택 가능\r\r\n* [ai-digest](https://github.com/khromov/ai-digest) - 코드베이스를 하나의 마크다운 파일로 생성\r\r\n* [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow) - Claude 기반 AI 에이전트를 여러 개 연결해 협업, 복잡한 작업을 단계별 워크플로우로 자동화\r\r\n* [agent-rules](https://github.com/steipete/agent-rules) - Cursor, Claude Code 같은 AI 코드 어시스턴트에게 일관된 행동 지침을 적용하는 규칙 템플릿 모음\r\r\n* [Conductor](https://conductor.build/) - Claude Code를 여러 개 동시에 실행하며 관리하는 도구\r\r\n* [Terragon](https://www.terragonlabs.com/) - Claude Code, OpenAI Codex 등 AI 코딩 에이전트를 클라우드에서 병렬 실행\r\r\n* [react-grab](https://github.com/aidenybai/react-grab) - 페이지의 모든 요소를 선택해 AI 코딩 에이전트에게 컨텍스트로 전달, 단일 스크립트 태그로 설치\r\r\n* [MCP Registry](https://github.com/mcp) - GitHub에서 다양한 MCP 서버를 모아둔 레지스트리\r\r\n* [streamdown](https://streamdown.ai/) - AI Chat 서비스처럼 마크다운 스트리밍 렌더링 지원\r\r\n* [lean-spec](https://github.com/codervisor/lean-spec) - 경량 SDD(Spec-Driven Development) 프레임워크\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그 외 분야별 소식\r\r\n\r\r\n### JavaScript/TypeScript\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년도 JavaScript와 TypeScript 생태계는 활발하게 움직였습니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

LLM 시대에 React가 사실상 기본 출력물이 되면서 새 프레임워크는 출발부터 불리하다는 주장도 과언이 아닙니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n작년 말 v19 릴리스 이후 `action`, `useActionState`, `useOptimistic`, `` 같은 기능이 추가됐습니다. Form Submit, Loading, Error 등 웹 애플리케이션이 늘 겪는 문제를 React 기본 기능으로 끌어당긴 모양새입니다. 다만 동시성이 기본값이 될수록 개발자도 새로운 규칙을 익혀야 합니다. 코드는 더 선언적으로 보이지만, 어떤 상태를 어떤 방식으로 업데이트할지 조직 내 합의도 필요해질 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nv19 이후 CRA(create-react-app)는 사실상 종료됐습니다. 의존성 충돌을 막기 위한 변경 사항이 병합되긴 했지만, 기존 애플리케이션도 Next.js, React Router, Vite 등으로 전환이 권고됐습니다. 이 권고 문구가 Next.js를 지나치게 강조한다며 커뮤니티에서 논란이 되기도 했습니다. 높은 채택률을 보였던 styled-components도 유지보수 모드로 전환됐습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n연말에는 RSC 보안 이슈가 터졌습니다. React가 인프라가 됐다는 말이 과장이 아님을 보여준 사건입니다. 이제 React가 커졌다는 건 기능의 문제가 아니라 책임 범위의 문제로 봐야 할 것 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### v19 신규 기능\r\r\n\r\r\naction, useActionState, useOptimistic, Activity, useEffectEvent, use() 등

보안 이슈와 복잡성\r\r\n\r\r\n어느샌가 프론트엔드는 브라우저를 넘어 서버 영역에 발을 들였습니다. 웹 성능 향상을 위한 기능 개선이 이어졌고, 서버 영역 진출만큼 보안 사고도 발생했습니다. 이 흐름의 중심에 Next.js가 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n기능이 추가될수록 복잡성도 함께 올라갔고, 많은 개발자가 피로감을 호소한 한 해였습니다. 대안으로 TanStack Start가 자주 언급됐고, Next.js를 떠나는 후기는 어느 순간 메모조차 하지 않을 만큼 많았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n보안 이슈도 빼놓을 수 없습니다. Next.js는 꽤 넓은 버전 범위에 걸쳐 미들웨어 인증 검사를 헤더만으로 우회할 수 있는 취약점이 있었습니다. 클라이언트 요청과 내부 SubRequest를 구분하기 위해 사용한 비공식 헤더가 문제였는데, 이를 악용하면 전혀 관련 없는 경로에 영향을 줄 수 있었습니다.

Angular, Svelte, Chrome DevTools 등 주요 프레임워크가 공식 MCP 서버를 출시했고, Spotify와 Amazon 팀의 실전 도입 사례가 속속 공개되기 시작했습니다. 바이브 코딩, 컨텍스트 엔지니어링, 스펙 주도 개발 같은 방법론이 등장했고, 최근에는 Claude에서 Skills라는 도구까지 나왔습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n자연스럽게 프론트엔드 영역의 생산성 개선에 관심이 쏠렸습니다. 하지만 LLM은 복잡한 인터랙션 처리에서 한계를 드러냈고, 기대만큼의 임팩트를 보여주진 못했습니다. 이 시기에 AI의 한계를 지적하는 글, 코드 리뷰의 중요성을 강조하는 글, 엔지니어의 책임을 다시 정의하는 글이 쏟아졌습니다. 미래를 단언할 수는 없지만, 현 시점에서는 개발자의 판단력이 여전히 핵심이라는 데 대체로 의견이 모이는 분위기입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n그럼에도 프론트엔드와 AI의 접점은 계속 넓어지고 있습니다. LLM이 웹 브라우저를 직접 제어하고, React 컴포넌트를 해석하는 도구들이 등장했습니다. Figma는 빠른 속도로 AI 기능을 도입하고 있고, 디자인 토큰을 AI가 읽을 수 있는 구조로 재설계하자는 제안도 나오고 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n2025년 한 해를 돌아보면 솔직히 동네 축구 같다는 생각도 듭니다.

Claude Skills와 Figma MCP 서버의 등장으로 디자인 시스템 팀이 AI를 활용해 마이그레이션 자동화, Storybook 스토리 생성, 토큰 검증 등 반복적인 작업을 자동화할 수 있게 되었고, 이에 따라 디자인 토큰을 AI가 올바르게 이해할 수 있도록 시맨틱 네이밍과 메타데이터를 추가하는 구조화가 새로운 과제로 언급되었습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n컴포넌트 설계 철학에서는 합성이 하나의 패러다임으로 떠올랐습니다. Figma의 네이티브 슬롯 지원을 계기로 고정된 컴포넌트 대신 기본 컨테이너와 재사용 가능한 자식 요소를 분리해 제공하는 방식이 확산되었고, 다중 추상화 계층 접근법도 주목 받았습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 토큰 영역에서는 DTCG가 18개월간 여러 가지 스펙 업데이트를 발표한 반면, 흥미롭게도 디자인 토큰이라는 용어를 처음 만든 Salesforce는 복잡해진 토큰 스펙 대신 CSS 커스텀 프로퍼티로 회귀했습니다. Figma 역시 토큰 대신 변수라는 용어를 선택하며, 업계가 토큰의 복잡성과 단순함 사이에서 균형점을 찾고 있음을 보여줍니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 설계 철학과 전략\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템의 본질과 성공 전략에 대한 논의입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Beyond the Plateau of Sameness](https://yeseniaperezcruz.substack.com/p/beyond-the-plateau-of-sameness)\r\r\n* [Bias in Design Systems](https://bencallahan.com/bias-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [The future of design systems is decentralized](https://uxdesign.cc/the-future-of-design-systems-is-decentralized-770db996442c)\r\r\n* [The dumbest design system mistakes](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-dumbest-design-system-mistakes)\r\r\n* [Design System Tactics](https://redesigningdesign.systems/tactics/all-tactics)\r\r\n* [designtokens.fyi](https://designtokens.fyi/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 컴포넌트 설계\r\r\n\r\r\n슬롯, 컴포지션, 추상화 계층 등 컴포넌트 설계 패턴입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [Slots in Design Systems](https://nathanacurtis.substack.com/p/slots-in-design-systems)\r\r\n* [Using composability over inheritance to scale design systems](https://zeroheight.com/blog/using-composability-over-inheritance-to-scale-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [Multiple Layers of Abstraction in Design Systems](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2023/05/multiple-layers-of-abstraction-in-design-systems/)\r\r\n* [The power of relationships in design systems](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/the-power-of-relationships-in-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 디자인 토큰\r\r\n\r\r\n토큰 스펙 진화와 실무 활용법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [What's new in the Design Tokens spec](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whats-new-in-the-design-tokens-spec/)\r\r\n* [Design Token-Based UI Architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/design-token-based-ui-architecture.html)\r\r\n* [A Design Token Workflow](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-1)\r\r\n* [Generating Utility Classes from Design Tokens](https://www.alwaystwisted.com/articles/a-design-tokens-workflow-part-13)\r\r\n* [Avoiding Tokens](https://blog.damato.design/posts/avoiding-tokens/)\r\r\n* [Introducing Design Tokens Language Server](https://bennypowers.dev/posts/introducing-design-tokens-language-server/)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### AI와 디자인 시스템\r\r\n\r\r\nAI 시대에 디자인 시스템을 활용하고 최적화하는 방법입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [3 practical ways LLMs can support design systems teams today](https://zeroheight.com/blog/3-practical-ways-llms-can-support-design-systems-teams-today/)\r\r\n* [Why your design system team need Claude Skills](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/why-your-design-system-team-need)\r\r\n* [Design tokens that AI can actually read](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/design-tokens-that-ai-can-actually)\r\r\n* [How to build patterns from your design system components with AI](https://learn.thedesignsystem.guide/p/how-to-build-patterns-from-your-design)\r\r\n\r\r\n#### 문서화와 운영\r\r\n\r\r\n디자인 시스템 문서화, 접근성 감사, 유지보수 전략 및 운영입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* [How to document your design system components](https://zeroheight.com/blog/how-to-document-your-design-system-components/)\r\r\n* [When's the right time to start documenting your design system?](https://zeroheight.com/blog/whens-the-right-time-to-start-documenting-your-design-system/)\r\r\n* [Storefront \\& Warehouse](https://blog.damato.design/posts/storefront-warehouse/)\r\r\n* [Design tokens aren't enough.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 미국에 한 10일 정도 갔다 왔다. 짧은 일정이었지만, 꽤 많은 업계 분과 투자자들을 만나서 요새 미국 tech 시장에서 어떤 일들이 일어나고 있고, 우리보다 훨씬 큰 투자자들은 어떤 생각을 하고 있고, 어떤 딜들을 보고 있고, 어떤 고민을 하고 있는지 들을 수 있었고, 동시에 많이 배울 수 있었다. 내가 이 글에서는 우리 같은 VC는 창업가에게 엄청 많이 배운다고 했는데, 이건 배움의 절반에 대해서만 이야기한 것 같다. 나머지 절반은 우리가 투자할 수 있게 소중한 자금을 제공해 주는 우리의 LP들에게 배우는 것 같다.\n아무래도 미국 벤처투자자들과 가장 많이 이야기했던 주제는 올해 예정된 스페이스엑스, 오픈AI, 그리고 앤쓰로픽의 IPO였는데 이 세 회사가 원하는 기업가치 총액은 거의 $3.5 trillion이다. 스페이스엑스가 공개적으로 이야기하는 기업가치가 $1.5T인데 이는 한국 GDP의 4분의 3이다. 정말 어마어마한 숫자이고 나도 이 일을 하면서 꽤 큰 금액에 대해 이야기하고 billion이라는 단어도 가끔 말하지만, trillion은 입에 담기조차 부담스러운 단위이다.\n요새 이 시장에선 billion과 trillion이라는 단위가 너무 남발되고 있고, 내가 느끼는 걸 영어로 표현해 보면 “$100 billion is the new $100 million(이제 1,000억 달러가 과거의 1억 달러다.)”이다. 솔직히 몇 년 전만 해도 미국의 대형 VC를 제외하곤 대부분의 VC가 $10B 밸류에 투자유치를 하는 회사들을 상당히 부담스러워했다. 일단 한화로 15조 원이라는 기업 가치 자체가 너무 컸고, 이 밸류에 투자하면 정말로 돈을 벌 수 있을지에 대한 의구심이 앞섰던 것 같다. 그리고 너무 비싸다는 불평을 계속하면서 아주 꼼꼼하고 깐깐하게 실사하고, 여러 번 고민했던, 그런 시절이 있었다.\n몇 년 전에는 전 세계에서 가장 비싼 유니콘 회사가 Stripe과 ByteDance였는데 가장 고점을 쳤을 때가 아마도 $100 B 정도였던 것 같다. 이 시기에 두 회사가 시장에서 펀드레이징을 돌 때, 회사를 소개해 주는 기존 주주들도 약간 민망해하면서 딜을 공유했던 기억이 난다. 왜냐하면 본인들의 포트폴리오지만, 본인들이 생각해도 말도 안 되게 비싼 것 같고 $100 B이라는 금액 자체가 너무나 큰돈이라서 감이 잘 안 잡혔던 것 같다. 그런데 요새는 상황이 완전히 반대다. $100B은 마치 과거의 $100M 같고 – 실은 $100M도 우리같이 작은 투자자에겐 너무나 큰 돈이다 – 스페이스엑스의 구주를 $1T에 구매하고 싶다는 투자자들도 충분히 있다는 소문은 나에게는 꽤 충격적인 시장의 현실이 아닐 수 없다. 그 누구도 오픈AI와 앤쓰로픽이 $1T이라는 숫자를 이야기할 때 비싸다는 이야기를 안 하고, 그 비싼 가격에 사면 누군가는 더 비싸게 살 사람이 있다는 생각으로만 – 이건 전형적인 바보들의 이론이다 – 이런 비싼 딜을 바라보고 있다. 마치 요샌 그냥 이 정도 가격을 내야 한다는 생각이 기본적으로 깔린 것 같다.\n지금 우리 주위에서 일어나는 이런 현상을 어떻게 설명해야 할까? 절대 금액의 의미 자체가 희석되어 숫자의 인플레이션이 일어나고 있는 것 같다. 숫자의 인플레이션이 아니라면 정말로 이 세상에 몇 년 전 대비 돈이 그렇게 많아졌을까? 종이 상으로는 많아졌을 수도 있지만, 정말로 $100B이라는 돈을 마치 $100M 같이 취급할 정도로? “이걸 더 높은 가격에 사는 다른 바보가 있다면, 현재의 가격이 맞는지는 중요하지 않다” 전략은 거품 시장에서 우리가 과거에도 몇 번 봤던 현상인데, 더 이상 더 높은 가격에 사는 바보들이 없어진다면 – 그리고 생각보다 빨리 없어질 수도 있다 – 이야기의 결말은 해피 엔딩이 아닐 것이다. 특히나 금액이 이렇게 커진 상황에서 시장이 무너지면 정말 전세계적인 재앙이 될 것이다.\n물론, 미국이라는 나라는 한국보다 GDP가 15배나 높은, 비교할 수 없을 정도의 강대국이다. 그래도 미국의 로켓 회사 하나, 그리고 두 개의 AI 회사의 총 기업가치가 전세계에서 13번째로 잘사는 나라인 대한민국 GDP의 거의 두 배라는 건 잘 모르겠다. 내가 걱정하는 이 재앙이 제발 오지 않았으면.",

4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}대학 스포츠에서 출발한\n아메리칸 풋볼의 탄생\n아메리칸 풋볼의 뿌리는 19세기 말 미국 유수의 명문 대학들이 모여 있는 아이비리그에서 시작되었습니다. 1869년 러트거스 대학과 프린스턴 대학의 경기로 거슬러 올라가는 이 스포츠는 1880년대 예일 대학의 코치 월터 캠프가 스크리미지 라인*과 다운 시스템** 같은 현대적 규칙을 정립하며 본격적인 틀을 갖추게 됩니다.\n*공격과 수비 팀이 대치하는 가상의 선\n** 공격팀이 4번의 기회 안에 10야드(약 9m) 이상 전진해야 공격권을 유지하는 규칙\n흥미로운 점은 아메리칸 풋볼이 보여주는 철저한 포지션 분화입니다. 각자의 역할이 명확히 나뉘고 전술적 협업이 필수적인 이 종목은 미국을 세계 최고의 산업 강대국으로 키운 분업화의 상징으로 자리 잡으며 미국인의 정체성에 깊이 스며들었습니다.\n대학 풋볼의 인기가 높아지면서 1920년에는 프로 리그가 탄생했고, 1922년부터는 NFL이라는 이름을 사용하게 됩니다. 본격적인 전환점은 1960년대였습니다. 1960년 AFL(아메리칸 풋볼 리그)이라는 경쟁 리그가 등장하며 치열한 선수 영입 경쟁이 벌어졌고, 결국 1966년 NFL과 AFL은 합병에 합의하게 됩니다. 이 합병의 결과로 1967년, 첫 슈퍼볼이 열렸습니다.\n슈퍼볼이라는 명칭은 1968년 2회 대회부터 사용됐습니다. 캔자스시티 치프스의 구단주 라마 헌트가 딸이 가지고 놀던 탱탱볼(Super Ball)에서 영감을 받아, Ball과 발음이 비슷한 Bowl을 붙여 사발 모양 경기장을 표현한 것이죠. 이 재치 있는 제안은 그대로 받아들여졌고, 지금은 세계에서 가장 유명한 스포츠 이벤트 이름이 됐습니다.\n\n미국 대학 스포츠에서도 최고의 인기를 자랑하는 대학 풋볼 리그 / 사진: Reuters\nNFL이 추구하는\n최대 다수의 최대 행복\nNFL이 압도적인 인기를 유지할 수 있었던 비결은 평등에 기초한 리그 설계에 있습니다. 1994년부터 시행된 하드 샐러리캡(연봉 총액 상한제)은 특정 부자 구단이 우수한 선수를 독점하지 못하도록 원천적으로 차단했습니다.\n엄격한 전력 균형 덕분에 팬들은 “우리 팀도 언제든 우승할 수 있다”는 희망을 품게 됐고, 실제로 하드 샐러리캡 도입 이후 슈퍼볼 3연패를 달성한 팀은 단 한 곳도 나오지 않았습니다. 철저한 하드 샐러리캡 시스템은 팬층의 고른 분포로 이어졌고, 2025년 기준 리그 전체 티켓 판매율 97.6%라는 놀라운 기록을 만들어냈습니다.\n2025년 홈구장 평균 관중 1위 팀은 댈러스 카우보이스로 약 9만 3,000명을 기록했고, 최하위 시카고 베어스도 약 5만 8,000명을 기록했습니다. 하지만 댈러스의 홈구장 수용 인원이 10만 명, 시카고가 6만 2,500명이라는 점을 감안하면 두 팀 모두 경기장을 거의 가득 채운 셈입니다. 격차는 팬덤의 차이라기보다 경기장 규모의 차이에서 비롯된 결과였죠.\n\n평균 관중 1위 팀 댈러스 카우보이스가 홈구장으로 사용하는 AT&T 스타디움 / 사진: ZUMA Press Wire\n슈퍼볼 광고비가\n천문학적으로 오르는 이유\n슈퍼볼의 가치를 가장 직관적으로 보여주는 지표는 단연 광고비입니다. 1967년 첫 대회 당시 4만 달러 수준이었던 30초 광고비는, 2025년 평균 800만 달러(약 117억 5,000만 원)까지 치솟았습니다. 총 광고시간이 약 51분에 달한다는 점을 고려하면 전체 광고비는 1조 2,000억 원에 이릅니다.\n2025년 슈퍼볼 시청자 수는 1억 2,771만 명이었습니다. 이는 1967년 2,443만 명에 비해 약 6배 가까이 늘어난 수치죠. 단일 경기로는 UEFA 챔피언스리그 결승전에 이어 두 번째로 많은 시청자를 기록한 이벤트이기도 합니다.\n\n하지만 단순히 시청자 수만으로는 슈퍼볼 광고비의 비밀을 설명하기 어렵습니다. 챔피언스리그 결승전보다 시청자는 적지만, 광고비는 훨씬 비싸기 때문이죠. 슈퍼볼 광고가 비싼 진짜 이유는 시청자들이 광고를 집중해서 찾아본다는 점에 있습니다. 일반 스포츠 경기에서는 광고 시간에 자리를 비우는 경우가 많지만, 오히려 슈퍼볼에서는 광고만 보기 위해 TV 앞에 앉는 사람들도 적지 않을 정도죠.\n슈퍼볼 광고가 주목받기 시작한 건 리들리 스콧 감독이 연출한 애플의 '1984' 광고를 선보인 1984년부터입니다. 조지 오웰의 소설을 모티브로 IBM 독점 시장에 도전장을 내민 이 광고는 단순한 제품 홍보를 넘어 하나의 예술 작품으로 평가받았고, 이후 슈퍼볼 광고는 기업들이 창의성과 사회적 메시지를 겨루는 격전장이 되었습니다.\n\n역사상 가장 영향력 있는 광고로 평가받는 애플의 1984 광고 스틸컷\n슈퍼볼 광고가 이처럼 특별해진 데는 구조적 요인도 작용했습니다. 먼저 시청자 대부분이 미국인이라는 점입니다. 참여하는 60여 개 업체에게 슈퍼볼은 미국 시장을 공략할 수 있는 1년에 단 한 번뿐인 골든타임이죠. 게다가 하프타임이 약 30분으로 길어 광고 시간도 충분합니다. 무엇보다 광고 자체가 문화적 이벤트가 되었습니다. 슈퍼볼 다음날 언론과 소셜미디어에서 '올해 최고의 슈퍼볼 광고'로 회자되면 그 자체로 엄청난 추가 홍보 효과를 얻으니까요.\n이런 환경 속에서 광고주들은 더 화려한 스케일과 더 높은 실험성으로 시청자들의 기억에 남기 위해 경쟁합니다. 영상미가 떨어지거나 스토리가 부족한 광고는 금세 잊히기 때문에, 기업들은 수백억 원을 투자해서라도 최고의 작품을 만들려고 합니다. 그 결과 광고의 완성도는 계속 높아지고, 시청자들의 집중도 역시 함께 올라가게 됩니다. 그리고 이 흐름은 지속적인 광고비 상승으로 이어지고 있습니다.\n전 세계가 열광하는\n슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼\n미국에서 당대 최고의 뮤지션으로 인정받으려면, 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼 출연 경력이 있어야 한다는 말이 있습니다. 마이클 잭슨, 롤링 스톤즈, 폴 매카트니, 레이디 가가, 비욘세 등 전설적인 스타들은 모두 이 무대를 거쳐갔습니다.\n하지만 처음부터 하프타임 쇼가 이렇게 주목받았던 건 아닙니다. 초기에는 대학 마칭 밴드*가 소박하게 하프타임을 채웠습니다. 변화는 1990년대에 시작됐습니다. 경쟁 방송사들이 슈퍼볼 하프타임 시간대에 특별 프로그램을 편성하며 시청률 경쟁을 벌이자, NFL은 1991년 뉴키즈 온더 블록을 시작으로 슈퍼스타들을 무대에 올리기 시작했습니다.\n* 행진하며 악기를 연주하는 미국 대학의 관악대\nNFL은 1993년 마이클 잭슨의 공연이 폭발적인 반응을 얻으면서, 하프타임 쇼를 본격적으로 상업화했습니다. 흥미로운 점은 NFL이 출연 뮤지션에게 출연료를 지급하지 않는다는 사실입니다. 대신 밴드와 스태프는 물론, 가족과 친구를 포함한 모든 수행원의 경비만 부담합니다. 그럼에도 뮤지션들이 기꺼이 무료 공연에 나서는 이유는 분명합니다. 하프타임 쇼 출연 소식만으로도 음원 차트가 급상승하고, 1억 명 이상이 지켜보는 무대는 그 어떤 광고보다 강력한 홍보 효과를 만들어내기 때문입니다.\n\n2025 슈퍼볼 하프타임 쇼로 전 세계 음원 차트를 휩쓴 켄드릭 라마 / 사진:  Imago Images Sports\n초기 하프타임 쇼의 스폰서십 가격은 약 15억 원 수준이었습니다. 하지만 하프타임 쇼에 대한 관심이 높아지면서, 스폰서십 가격은 50배 가까이 올랐습니다. 타이어 제조회사 브리지스톤은 2008년부터 2012년까지 연간 약 150억 원, 펩시는 2013년부터 2022년까지 매년 361억 원을 스폰서십 비용으로 지출했습니다.\n2023년부터는 애플 뮤직이 스폰서로 나서며 연간 735억 원이라는 천문학적 금액을 쏟아붓고 있습니다. 음악 스트리밍 시장에서 스포티파이와 치열하게 경쟁 중인 애플 뮤직에게 이 투자는 결코 헛되지 않았습니다. 2025년 켄드릭 라마의 공연은 1억 3,350만 명이 시청하며 1993년 마이클 잭슨 이후 역대 최다 기록을 갈아치웠기 때문이죠.\n이제 FIFA 역시 슈퍼볼을 벤치마킹하기 시작했습니다. 오는 6월 열릴 북중미 월드컵 결승전에서 사상 첫 하프타임 쇼를 계획하고 있기 때문입니다. 다만 축구의 15분 하프타임 안에, 30분 이상이 소요되는 슈퍼볼 수준의 쇼를 구현할 수 있을지는 여전히 의문으로 남아 있습니다. FIFA가 자신들의 규칙을 지키면서 어떤 묘안을 내놓을지, 관심이 쏠립니다.\n미국인들의 버킷리스트\n슈퍼볼 직관\n슈퍼볼 입장권 가격 역시 상상을 초월합니다. 2025년 기준 평균 입장권 가격은 약 950만 원이었고, 가장 저렴한 좌석도 44만 원에 달했습니다. 이마저도 경기장 맨 꼭대기 층에 위치해, 실제로는 대형 스크린으로 경기를 봐야 할 정도입니다.\n이 금액은 미국 중산층에게도 부담스러운 수준입니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아메리칸 풋볼에 열광하는 미국인들은 슈퍼볼 직관을 일생일대의 기회로 여깁니다. NFL의 인기가 높아질수록 이 꿈을 꾸는 사람은 늘어나고, 티켓 가격은 계속 오르지만 관중석은 늘 가득 찹니다.\n실제로 슈퍼볼 입장권 총 수익은 2010년 약 900억 원에서 2025년 약 2,400억 원으로 15년 사이 2.7배 증가했습니다. 7만~8만 명 규모의 경기장이 매년 거의 만석을 기록하면서 티켓 가격 상승이 곧바로 수익 증가로 이어지는 구조가 완성된 것이죠.\n\n하루 만에 맥주 24억 잔이 팔리는\n슈퍼볼 경제 효과\n2025년 루이지애나주 뉴올리언스에서 열린 제59회 슈퍼볼의 개최지 경제 효과는 약 1조 8,100억 원으로 추산됩니다. 이 가운데 절반은 외지에서 몰려든 팬들이 만들어낸 관광 특수였습니다. 10만 명이 넘는 팬들이 개최지를 찾았고, 이 중 92%가 평균 4일간 머물렀습니다. 그 결과 호텔 공실률은 4%에 불과했고, 슈퍼볼 준비 과정에서만 1만 개가 넘는 일자리가 새로 생겨났습니다. 세수 증대 효과 역시 1,000억 원을 훌쩍 넘었습니다.\n막대한 인프라 투자가 필요한 올림픽이나 월드컵과 달리, 슈퍼볼은 기존 시설만으로도 엄청난 수익을 만들어냅니다. 그래서 미국의 도시들은 슈퍼볼 유치를 두고 치열한 경쟁을 벌입니다. 과거에는 32개 NFL 구단의 투표로 개최지를 정했지만, 경쟁이 과열되자 2018년부터는 NFL이 도시들과 장기 협상을 통해 개최지를 결정하는 방식으로 바뀌었습니다.\n슈퍼볼 당일의 소비 규모도 놀랍습니다. 2025년 슈퍼볼 당일 미국에서는 맥주 12억 리터, 치킨 윙 14억 7,000개, 감자 칩 1,900만 개, 피자 290만 개가 팔렸습니다. 슈퍼볼은 미국에서 가장 많은 맥주가 소비되는 날이기도 합니다.\n\n슈퍼볼을 대표하는 음식이 된 치킨 윙 / 사진: Imagn Images\n슈퍼볼에는 미국의 역사가 깊이 새겨져 있습니다. 아메리칸 풋볼 자체가 영국의 럭비에서 독립해 만들어진 스포츠입니다. 19세기 말 미국 대학들이 영국의 영향에서 벗어나 자신들만의 규칙을 만들며 탄생시킨 아메리칸 풋볼은 문화적 독립의 상징이었죠.\n슈퍼볼 대표 음식 치킨 윙에는 더 아픈 역사가 담겨 있습니다. 백인 농장주들이 버린 닭 날개를 흑인 노예들이 모아 만들어 먹던 것이 1980년대 레스토랑과 바의 인기 메뉴가 되었고, 짜고 매운 소스가 맥주 판매를 늘리는 효과 덕분에 슈퍼볼의 상징이 되었습니다. 굶주림 속에서 태어난 음식이 미국 최대 축제의 주인공이 된 셈입니다.\n2026년 슈퍼볼이 열릴 경기장 역시 미국 역사의 한 장면을 보여줍니다. 캘리포니아주 산타 클라라의 리바이스 스타디움은 19세기 골드러시 시대 광부들을 위해 탄생한 청바지 브랜드 리바이스의 이름을 따왔습니다. 튼튼한 청바지로 황금을 찾아 나선 개척자들의 꿈을 지탱했던 리바이스는 이제 새로운 꿈을 좇는 미국인들이 모이는 성지가 되었죠.\n평등을 추구하는 리그 철학, 광고가 문화가 된 독특한 생태계, 그리고 모든 미국인의 꿈이 된 축제. 슈퍼볼은 이 모든 요소를 품고 성장했기에 미국인이 가장 사랑하는 지상 최대 스포츠 이벤트로 거듭날 수 있었습니다.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 조수희",
