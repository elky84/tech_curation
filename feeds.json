        "content:encodedSnippet": "The 2025 Typed Python Survey, conducted by contributors from JetBrains, Meta, and the broader Python typing community, offers a comprehensive look at the current state of Python’s type system and developer tooling. With 1,241 responses (a 15% increase from last year), the survey captures the evolving sentiment, challenges, and opportunities around Python typing in the open-source ecosystem. In this blog we’ll cover a summary of the key findings and trends from this year’s results.\nWho Responded?\nThe survey was initially distributed on official social media accounts by the survey creators, and subsequently shared organically across further platforms including Reddit, email newsletters, Mastodon, LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitter. When respondents were asked which platform they heard about the survey from, Reddit emerged as the most effective channel, but significant engagement also came from email newsletters and Mastodon, reflecting the diverse spaces where Python developers connect and share knowledge.\nThe respondent pool was predominantly composed of developers experienced with Python and typing. Nearly half reported over a decade of Python experience, and another third had between five and 10 years. While there was representation from newcomers, the majority of participants brought substantial expertise to their responses. Experience with type hints was similarly robust, with most respondents having used them for several years and only a small minority indicating no experience with typing.\nTyping Adoption and Attitudes\nThe survey results reveal that Python’s type hinting system has become a core part of development for most engineers. An impressive 86% of respondents report that they “always” or “often” use type hints in their Python code, a figure that remains consistent with last year’s Typed Python survey. \nFor the first time this year the survey also asked participants to indicate how many years of experience they have with Python and with Python typing. We found that adoption of typing is similar across all experience levels, but there are some interesting nuances:\nDevelopers with 5–10 years of Python experience are the most enthusiastic adopters, with 93% reporting regularly using type hints.\nAmong the most junior developers (0–2 years of experience), adoption is slightly lower at 83%. Possible reasons for this could be the learning curve for newcomers (repeatedly mentioned in later survey questions).\nFor senior developers (10+ years of experience), adoption was the lowest of all cohorts, with  only 80% reporting using them always or often. Reasons for this drop are unclear, it could reflect more experienced python developers having gotten used to writing Python without type hints before they were supported, or possibly they are more likely to work on larger or legacy codebases that are difficult to migrate.\nPercent of respondents who use types “often” or “always,” segmented by years of Python experience.\nOverall, the data shows that type hints are widely embraced by the Python community, with strong support from engineers at all experience levels. However, we should note there may be some selection bias at play here, as it’s possible developers who are more familiar with types and use them more often are also more likely to be interested in taking a survey about it.\nWhy Developers Love Python Typing\nWhen asked what developers loved about the Python type system there were some mixed reactions, with a number of responses just stating, “nothing” (note this was an optional question). This indicates the presence of some strong negative opinions towards the type system among a minority of Python users. The majority of responses were positive, with the following themes emerging prominently:\nOptionality and Gradual Adoption: The optional nature of the type system and the ability to adopt it incrementally into existing projects are highly valued, allowing flexibility in development.\nImproved Readability and Documentation: Type hints serve as in-code documentation, making code clearer and easier to read, understand, and reason about for both the author and other developers, especially in larger codebases.\nEnhanced Tooling and IDE Support: The type system significantly improves IDE features like autocomplete/IntelliSense, jump-to-definition, and inline type hints, leading to a better developer experience.\nBug Prevention and Code Correctness: It helps catch errors and subtle bugs earlier during development or refactoring, increasing confidence and leading to more robust and reliable code.\nFlexibility and Features: Respondents appreciate the flexibility, expressiveness, and powerful features of the system, including protocols, generics (especially the new syntax), and the ability to inspect annotations at runtime for use with libraries like Pydantic/FastAPI.\nSample of responses to the question, “What do you love about Python Typing?”\nChallenges and Pain Points\nIn addition to assessing positive sentiment towards Python typing, we also asked respondents what challenges and pain points they face. With over 800 responses to the question, “What is the hardest part about using the Python type system?” the following themes were identified:\nThird-Party Library/Framework Support: Many respondents cited the difficulty of integrating types with untyped, incomplete, or incorrect type annotations in third-party libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Django).\nComplexity of Advanced Features: Advanced concepts such as generics, TypeVar (including co/contravariance), callables/decorators, and complex/nested types were frequently mentioned as difficult to understand or express.\nTooling and Ecosystem Fragmentation: The ecosystem is seen as chaotic, with inconsistencies between different type checkers (like Mypy and Pyright), slow performance of tools like Mypy, and a desire for an official, built-in type checker.\nLack of Enforcement and Runtime Guarantees: The fact that typing is optional and is not enforced at runtime or by the Python interpreter makes it harder to convince others to use it, enforce its consistent use, and fully trust the type hints.\nVerbosity and Code Readability: The necessary type hints, especially for complex structures, can be verbose, make the code less readable, and feel non-Pythonic.\nDealing with Legacy/Dynamic Code: It is hard to integrate typing into old, untyped codebases, particularly when they use dynamic Python features that do not play well with static typing.\nType System Limitations and Evolution: The type system is perceived as incomplete or less expressive than languages like TypeScript, and its rapid evolution means syntax and best practices are constantly changing.\nMost Requested Features\nA little less than half of respondents had suggestions for what they thought was missing from the Python type system, the most commonly requested features being:\nMissing Features From TypeScript and Other Languages: Many respondents requested features inspired by TypeScript, such as Intersection types (like the & operator), Mapped and Conditional types, Utility types (like Pick, Omit, keyof, and typeof), and better Structural typing for dictionaries/dicts (e.g., more flexible TypedDict or anonymous types).\nRuntime Type Enforcement and Performance: A significant number of developers desire optional runtime type enforcement or guarantees, as well as performance optimizations (JIT/AOT compilation) based on the type hints provided.\nBetter Generics and Algebraic Data Types (ADTs): Requests include features like higher-kinded types (HKT), improved support for TypeVarTuple (e.g., bounds and unpacking), better generics implementation, and official support for algebraic data types (e.g., Result, Option, or Rust-like enums/sum types).\nImproved Tooling, Consistency, and Syntax: Developers asked for an official/built-in type checker that is fast and consistent, a less verbose syntax for common patterns like nullable types (? instead of | None) and callables, and better support/documentation for complex types (like nested dicts, NumPy/Pandas arrays).\nHandling of Complex/Dynamic Patterns: Specific missing capabilities include better support for typing function wrappers/decorators (e.g., using ParamSpec effectively), being able to type dynamic attributes (like those added by Django/ORMs), and improved type narrowing and control flow analysis.\nTooling Trends\nThe developer tooling landscape for Python typing continues to evolve, with both established and emerging tools shaping how engineers work.\nMypy remains the most widely used type checker, with 58% of respondents reporting using it. While this represents a slight dip from 61% in last year’s survey, Mypy still holds a dominant position in the ecosystem. At the same time, new Rust-based type checkers like Pyrefly, Ty, and Zuban are quickly gaining traction, now used by over 20% of survey participants collectively.\nThe top six most popular answers to the question, “What type checking tools do your projects use (select all that apply)?”\nWhen it comes to development environments, VS Code leads the pack as the most popular IDE among Python developers, followed by PyCharm and (Neo)vim/vim. The use of type checking tools within IDEs also mimics the popularity of the IDE themselves, with VS Code’s default (Pylance/Pyright) and PyCharm’s built-in support being the first and third most popular options respectively.\nHow Developers Learn and Get Help\nWhen it comes to learning about Python typing and getting help, developers rely on a mix of official resources, community-driven content, and AI-powered tools, a similar learning landscape to what we saw in last year’s survey.\nTop six responses to the question, “How do you learn Python typing (select all that apply)?”\nOfficial documentation remains the go-to resource for most developers. The majority of respondents reported learning about Python typing through the official docs, with 865 citing it as their primary source for learning and 891 turning to it for help. Python’s dedicated typing documentation and type checker-specific docs are also heavily used, showing that well-maintained, authoritative resources are still highly valued.\nBlog posts have climbed in popularity, now ranking as the second most common way developers learn about typing, up from third place last year. Online tutorials, code reviews, and YouTube videos also play a significant role.\nCommunity platforms are gaining traction as sources for updates and new features. Reddit, in particular, has become a key channel for discovering new developments in the type system, jumping from fifth to third place as a source for news. Email newsletters, podcasts, and Mastodon are also on the rise.\nLarge language models (LLMs) are now a notable part of the help-seeking landscape. Over 400 respondents reported using LLM chat tools, and nearly 300 use in-editor LLM suggestions when working with Python typing. \nOpportunities and Next Steps\nThe 2025 Python Typing Survey highlights the Python community’s sustained adoption of typing features and tools to support their usage. It also points to clear opportunities for continued growth and improvement, including:\nIncreasing library coverage: One of the most consistent requests from the community is for broader and deeper type annotation coverage in popular libraries. Expanding type hints across widely used packages will make static typing more practical and valuable for everyone.\nImproving documentation: While official documentation remains the top resource, there’s a strong appetite for more discoverable and accessible learning materials. Leveraging channels like newsletters, blog posts, and Reddit can help surface new features, best practices, and real-world examples to a wider audience.\nClarify tooling differences: The growing variety of type checkers and tools is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, but can also reflect a lack of consensus/standardisation and can be confusing for users. There’s an opportunity to drive more consistency between tools or provide clearer guidance on their differences and best-fit use cases.\nTo learn more about Meta Open Source, visit our website, subscribe to our YouTube channel, or follow us on Facebook, Threads, X, Bluesky and LinkedIn.\nAcknowledgements\nThis survey ran from 29th Aug to 16th Sept 2025 and received 1,241 responses in total.\nThanks to everyone who participated!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We introduced TeamCity Pipelines in March 2024 to make CI/CD setup simpler and more intuitive, without limiting what teams can build and automate. Pipelines brought a new workflow focused on a more guided configuration experience, including a visual editor with drag-and-drop dependencies, YAML for defining building routines from scratch, and a set of practical configuration flows that reduce friction in day-to-day work.\nAfter the launch, we received a lot of positive feedback about the Pipelines UX and approach. At the same time, TeamCity Enterprise users repeatedly asked when this experience would become available in the main TeamCity product.\nBringing Pipelines to TeamCity Enterprise (EAP)\nIn July 2025, we introduced Pipelines to TeamCity Enterprise in version 2025.07 as part of an Early Access Program (EAP). The goal was to test how the Pipelines experience works on regular TeamCity servers, gauge real usage and interest, and give early adopters a way to start using Pipelines on their TeamCity Enterprise instances.\nAt that stage, the Pipelines support inside TeamCity Enterprise was intentionally not enabled by default and hidden from the main UI. We did this to avoid confusing users who expect the full breadth of TeamCity capabilities everywhere in the product.\nOne TeamCity product going forward\nIn December 2025, we made a product decision to unify TeamCity Pipelines and TeamCity Enterprise into a single TeamCity offering. A single product lets us focus our engineering and design efforts in one place, deliver improvements faster, and keep the experience consistent across TeamCity Cloud and TeamCity On-Premises.\nWhat to expect next:\nThe new Pipelines experience will be available alongside classic build configurations and build chains, so teams can use them both at the same time.\nWe’ll continue expanding Pipelines to support more of TeamCity’s advanced capabilities.\nWe’ll keep improving the TeamCity user experience. \nAs a result of this change, TeamCity Pipelines is no longer offered as a separate, standalone product. Going forward, the Pipelines experience will be delivered through TeamCity Enterprise, in both the Cloud and On-Premises versions.\nWhat about TeamCity Pipelines users?\nFor existing TeamCity Pipelines users, this change was handled as an upgrade to TeamCity Cloud Enterprise. Pipelines environments were kept intact and migrated to fall under the main TeamCity Cloud Enterprise experience. Existing subscriptions and pricing remained unchanged for those users as part of the transition. This migration was communicated separately and has already been completed.\nSo what does TeamCity look like now?\nThere is now one TeamCity platform. Sign up for TeamCity Cloud Enterprise to test the integrated Pipelines experience, alongside the rest of TeamCity’s CI/CD capabilities.\nIf you’re ready to give the Pipelines EAP a try in TeamCity On-Premises, you can head over to the sign-up page or click the Join Early Access Program link in the TeamCity UI. You’ll then be shown a transparent overview of current features, limitations, and our roadmap.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Created by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto and first released in 1995, Ruby arrived with a purpose that was simple but profound: to make coding more human, more intuitive, and more enjoyable. Its object-oriented model, dynamic typing, and elegant syntax offered a fresh alternative to the heavier and more complex languages of that era.\nAs Ruby marks its 30th anniversary alongside the release of Ruby 4.0, we on the RubyMine team want to reflect on the path that led the language to where it is today and honor this remarkable milestone.\nThis year, with Ruby turning 30, we’re making RubyMine free for non-commercial use, helping nurture the next generation of Ruby developers and supporting a thriving community.\nClick here to try Ruby 4.0 in RubyMine for free.\nFrom revolutionary philosophy to thriving community\nSince its inception, Ruby has been more than a set of language constructs. Matz built it around the Principle of Least Surprise, so code would read naturally and behave as developers expect. Ruby’s “Everything is an object” model and its expressive method syntax made everyday tasks clearer, while metaprogramming enabled elegant, domain-specific abstractions. The vision for the language highlights readability and flexibility, showing that the way we write code is as important as the result.\nThis philosophy spread throughout the community, emphasizing practical, elegant solutions over hype and leading to the creation of valuable tools like:\nBundler, by Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche, which enabled reliable team collaboration through dependency management. \nRSpec, initiated by Steven Baker and refined by David Chelimsky and others, which made behavior-driven testing natural to read and write. \nRuboCop, maintained by Bozhidar Batsov, which brought a shared foundation for code style and automated linting.\nTogether, these tools extended Ruby, which today is more than a language: It is a community, a set of conventions, and a mindset that values craftsmanship and expressive, maintainable code.\nThe path to modern excellence\nOver the years, Ruby has advanced to meet constantly increasing demands and evolving development paradigms. Here’s a closer look at the milestones that shaped the language.\nRuby 1.x (2003–2007)\nRuby 1.8 stabilized the language with mature libraries and solid object-oriented foundations, paving the way for early web frameworks like Rails. Ruby 1.9 introduced the YARV VM, improving speed, regex handling, and syntax. Upgrading to v1.9 cut web request times nearly in half, making Ruby practical for real applications.\nRuby 2.x (2013–2018)\nRuby 2.x boosted reliability and added features to help developers be more productive. Keyword arguments clarified method calls, refinements allowed safer class changes, and incremental GC improved performance. Enhanced libraries simplified tasks like JSON parsing and date handling, helping developers scale complex projects.\nRuby 3.x (2020–2023)\nRuby 3.x delivered on the long-promised vision of Ruby 3×3. Ractors enabled parallelism, JIT improved real-world performance, and RBS with TypeProf added static analysis and safer refactoring. The update reinforced Ruby’s readable, flexible, and productive coding philosophy.\nRuby 4.0 (2025)\nThe latest version comes with ZJIT, a method-based JIT compiler that redefines Ruby’s performance potential. It also introduces Ruby::Box, an experimental namespace-on-read mode, and notable Ractor improvements, such as Ractor::Port and safer shareable Proc objects.\nRuby’s global impact\nThe early 2000s brought a transformative moment with the release of Ruby on Rails. Created by David Heinemeier Hansson and released in 2004, Rails paired Ruby’s transparency and natural flow with a framework that emphasized convention over configuration, streamlined workflows, and rapid development. \nSuddenly, Ruby became the engine behind a new generation of web startups, proving that elegant design could coexist with productivity and scale.\nRuby’s influence quickly spread to platforms that reshaped the digital world. Here are some of the standout projects:\nGitHub, launched in 2008, relied on Rails and Ruby’s syntax to build a collaborative environment capable of handling millions of developers and repositories. \nShopify, which was created in 2006 and now boasts the title of the world’s biggest app powered by Ruby and Rails, scaled from a platform supporting small online shops to a global e-commerce powerhouse.\nAirbnb, founded in 2008, used Ruby to power dynamic booking systems, host management, and pricing algorithms, enabling the platform to expand worldwide. \nHomebrew, created by Max Howell in 2009 to simplify software installation and dependency management on macOS, was built using Ruby and serves millions of developers.\nToday, Ruby continues to be a popular choice for young startups, including Whop, a Gen‑Z marketplace, and Chime, a rapidly growing fintech company. Both of these projects leverage Ruby on Rails to build scalable and modern platforms, highlighting the framework’s enduring relevance.\nRefining the Ruby experience with RubyMine\nIntroduced by JetBrains in 2009, RubyMine was built as a dedicated IDE designed to bring the full expressive power of Ruby and Rails to developers. With deep code understanding for metaprogramming, smart navigation aligned with Rails conventions, robust testing framework support, and debugging tools, RubyMine enables developers to work efficiently while staying true to the spirit of the language.\nMore than just supporting the ecosystem, RubyMine actively helps shape it. As Ruby continues to evolve, introducing new syntax, technologies, libraries, and development approaches, RubyMine quickly adopts and supports these changes, providing developers with up-to-date, practical tooling from day one. \nBy delivering advanced static analysis, powerful refactoring tools, and a continuously updated understanding of the language, RubyMine contributes directly to Ruby’s ongoing popularity and relevance. Its design reflects Ruby itself; it’s powerful, ever-evolving, and built to make coding enjoyable. \nFinal words\nAs Ruby enters its fourth decade, we celebrate not only the language but also the people whose passion, creativity, and dedication have made it thrive. From mentors and contributors to conference organizers and Rails developers worldwide, this community embodies the spirit that keeps Ruby vibrant and evolving.\nThe RubyMine team is proud to pay tribute to both this inspiring language and the people who bring it to life.\nThe RubyMine team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Disclaimer: This article was created using AI-based writing and communication companions. With its help, the core topics of this rich and nuanced livestream were conveniently distilled into a compact blog post format.\nIn our recent JetBrains livestream, Vitaly Bragilevsky sat down with Rust expert and educator Herbert Wolverson (Ardan Labs) to talk about everything Rust developers – beginners and pros alike – are curious about. From ownership and lifetimes to salaries and async programming, here’s a recap of the best questions and insights. Watch the full livestream replay on JetBrains TV and check out the GitHub repo with Herbert’s prepared answers and code samples. Below is a short summary of the 23 questions that were covered during the livestream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1. What’s your new book about?\nMy latest book is Advanced Hands-On Rust, a follow-up to Hands-On Rust. The first book guided readers from beginner to early intermediate level, while the new one takes you further into advanced topics like generics, macros, and library design. You can find it on Amazon, Barnes & Noble, or directly from the publisher’s website for an eBook version.\n“I felt like the first book got you to the end of beginner level and then stopped a little too early. This one takes you through intermediate and early advanced topics.”\n\n            \nQ2. What’s the biggest mindset shift when moving to Rust from C++, Java, or C#?\nThe biggest difference is thinking about memory. In Java or C#, the runtime handles garbage collection for you. In Rust, you explicitly manage memory – but safely. It’s closer to C++ in that sense, yet Rust prevents entire classes of bugs like data races or use-after-free.\nRust’s ownership model and smart pointers (like Box, similar to C++’s unique_ptr) give you precise control without a garbage collector. It’s a language built to make it impossible to shoot yourself in the foot in the usual ways.\n“If you’re coming from Java or C#, memory sounds terrifying. You expect something horrific. But you can go days in Rust without explicitly managing memory.”\n\n            \nQ3. Is Rust really that hard to learn?\nIt used to be! Early Rust looked terrifying, full of strange symbols and lifetimes everywhere. Today, the syntax and ecosystem are much friendlier. You can build practical apps — like a small web server — without worrying about memory management at all. The learning curve still exists, but it’s much smoother thanks to improved libraries and tooling.\n“I like to teach people so that by the end of day one, they’ve already built something useful.”\n\n            \nQ4. Should I learn C first or go straight to Rust?\nYou can start with Rust directly. C is lower-level, but Rust can be used at various abstraction levels. Long term, it’s best to learn multiple languages — not for competition, but for perspective.\n“The most important thing isn’t the language — it’s that you actually learn something and build something.”\n\n            \nQ5. Will Rust gain widespread adoption soon?\nIt already is. The Linux kernel now officially includes Rust, which is a major milestone. I’m training more teams in defense, aerospace, finance, and automotive. Rust’s adoption is expanding rapidly.\n“Linux ended their Rust experiment by saying: Rust is in the kernel now. Rust is going to be around forever. I fully expect to retire and still be called back to fix Rust code.”\n\n            \nQ6. How should beginners approach learning Rust?\nA: Choose a learning style that fits you:\nBooks: Hands-On Rust, Rust in Action, Programming Rust.\nOnline Resources: The official Rust Book and Rust by Example (free on the Rust website).\nProjects: Build something small and fun — games, scripts, or web services.\nRust gives you multiple paths, so experiment and learn by doing.\n“Some people learn from books, some from videos, some by just banging their head against the wall until it works.”\n\n            \n\nQ7. What are ownership and borrowing in Rust?\nThink of it like lending your car:\nIf I move my car to you, it’s now yours — you can destroy it.\nIf I borrow it, you use it but must return it.\nThis system prevents two parts of the program from destroying the same data or accessing it unsafely. It eliminates entire classes of memory errors common in C and C++.\n“Rust makes it impossible for some other part of the program to destroy the car without either of us knowing.”\n\n            \nQ8. What does “zero-cost abstractions” mean?\nIt means you don’t pay a runtime cost for nice language features. Rust’s abstractions (like iterators, traits, and lifetimes) are compiled away — they help you write safer, clearer code without adding runtime overhead. What you write is as efficient as hand-optimized C code.\nQ9. Should I use iterators or loops?\nUse whichever you find clearer. Iterators are powerful and expressive, especially with libraries like rayon for parallelism. But if a simple for loop is more readable for you, that’s fine too. Performance is usually identical.\n“Sometimes I write iterators. Sometimes I write loops. Either is fine.”\n\n            \nQ10. Can Rust be part of polyglot systems?\nAbsolutely. Rust integrates well with other languages using FFI (Foreign Function Interface). You can, for example, link Rust with C#, Python, or even databases like LanceDB. Use Rust where performance and memory safety matter most.\n“You don’t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater. You can mix Rust with C#, Java, or whatever you already have.”\n\n            \nQ11. Which book should beginners start with — Hands-On Rust or Advanced Hands-On Rust?\nStart with Hands-On Rust. It introduces concepts through game development examples. Once you’re comfortable, move on to Advanced Hands-On Rust for deeper topics like generics and macros.\nQ12. How quickly should I learn async code?\nLearn synchronous Rust first. Async Rust adds complexity under the hood — every async fn becomes a state machine. Once you’re comfortable with ownership and borrowing, move to async with frameworks like Tokio.\nQ13. Why are there no exceptions in Rust?\nRust uses Result and Option types instead of try/catch. This forces you to handle potential errors explicitly rather than ignoring them. It’s a safer and clearer model. There’s talk about adding a throw keyword, but it’s unlikely to change this core philosophy.\n“Rust wanted to make it harder to not check errors. With [Result], you at least have to acknowledge that something might have gone wrong.”\n\n            \nQ14. Why both Result and Option?\nBecause they express different ideas:\nOption = something might be missing (e.g. user not found).\nResult = something went wrong (e.g. database error). Sometimes you even see Result<Option<T>, E> — perfectly fine.\n“They’re signaling intent. That’s why they’re different.”\n\n            \nQ15. Which external crates should I learn first?\nserde – for serialization/deserialization (JSON, YAML, etc.)\ncolored – for simple CLI output formatting\nThese crates are practical and teach how macros and traits work in real use.\n“Serde is one of the crates that really got me into Rust. You add one derive and suddenly everything just works.”\n\n            \nQ16. Structs, enums, traits — when to use which?\nStructs: group related data, like classes or records.\nEnums: define a fixed set of possibilities, each possibly carrying data.\nTraits: define shared behavior (like interfaces in other languages).\nTogether, they form Rust’s type and abstraction system.\n“Enums in Rust are much more powerful than in most languages — they can carry data and work beautifully with pattern matching.”\n\n            \nQ17. What’s pattern matching and why is it important?\nRust is strongly type-driven and pattern matching is central to Rust. It’s how you unpack Result, Option, or enum types safely. The match keyword ensures you handle all cases — the compiler even warns if you miss one. It’s similar to functional languages like Haskell or OCaml.\nQ18. How to understand lifetimes easily?\nLifetimes track how long data lives to prevent dangling references. The compiler does most of the work now. If you need to write lifetime annotations manually, it’s often a sign your code is too complex. Tools like RustRover’s lifetime visualizer can help you understand them better.\n“If I have to write a lifetime annotation, I start wondering if I made something too complicated.”\n\n            \nTry RustRover\n                                                    \nQ19. When to use references vs. smart pointers (Box, Rc, Arc)?\nReferences (&): temporary, non-owning access.\nBox: store large data on the heap.\nRc / Arc: reference-counted pointers for shared ownership (single- or multi-threaded).\nThey’re ways to balance ownership, safety, and performance.\n“Ownership is about who owns the data. References are about who’s allowed to look at it.”\n\n            \nQ20. Why is immutability the default in Rust?\nRust defaults to immutable variables to prevent accidental mutation — a common source of bugs. You can make variables mutable with mut when needed. It’s about safety and clarity, not restriction.\n“It stops me from shooting myself in the foot by changing a variable somewhere deep in a function.”\n\n            \nQ21. How should I organize Rust projects?\nGroup related code into modules. Use mod.rs or mod files to define structure and expose only what’s needed with pub. Larger projects can be organized into workspaces. Think of modules as logical boundaries, not just files.\nQ22. What are macros and when should beginners use them?\nMacros generate code at compile time — for example, println! is a macro.\nThey come in two kinds: declarative (macro_rules!) and procedural (derive, proc_macro). Use them when you need repetitive boilerplate or metaprogramming, but sparingly – they can make code harder to read and harder for IDEs to analyze.\n“You can do amazing things with macros. You can also do terrible things. But don’t.”\n\n            \nQ23. Will Rust ever “rust”?\nHopefully not! But like all languages, it will evolve. The team is good at deprecating old features gracefully, so the language should age well.\n“Every language ages. Rust just makes it easier to get rid of old ideas than most.”\n\n            \nRust’s learning curve is real, but its ecosystem, documentation, and community make the journey smoother than ever.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "If you’ve been \tkeeping up with Java virtual threads, you already know that this hot new feature significantly improves hardware utilization for parallel I/O-bound operations. Virtual threads map multiple concurrent I/O operations to a single OS thread without blocking. The novel aspect of this approach is that it requires minimal changes to the codebase, as it provides a lightweight concurrency primitive that is compatible with the existing APIs.\nThis is, of course, great news for Java developers. Previously, achieving similar results meant writing complex callback-based pipelines or relying on reactive Java frameworks that were far from simple.\nAside from a few minor details, Java virtual threads really are as great as they sound. The API is simple and familiar, with throughput increasing by up to a few orders of magnitude. Where servers once managed only a few hundred threads, they can now handle millions.\nSo what does this mean for the rest of the ecosystem?\n\nThe state of tooling\nVirtual threads pose quite the challenge to existing Java tooling. Your UI-based thread dump viewer or debugger may now present you with millions of rows, and simply displaying them can be a struggle. And even if it succeeds, there is still a UX issue. How is the user supposed to navigate all that information?\nOr take, for example, a classic async debugging problem: Scheduler and worker code are typically called in different threads, rendering the worker’s stack trace logically incomplete. Since a task starts in one thread and fails in another, the error’s stack trace misses the path that schedules the task. And that path might be important for understanding the cause of the problem.\nAlthough the Java ecosystem has been doing a good job adapting to  change, some gaps remain. Each challenge is multifaceted and could warrant a post of its own. In the rest of this article, we’ll dive deeper into one of these challenges: thread dumps and how to use them effectively.\nThread dumps\nSpeaking of tooling and concurrency, the first thing that comes to mind is thread dumps!\nA deadlock? An unresponsive UI? Thread explosion or leak? When investigating any of these issues, a thread dump is usually the starting point. Simple yet powerful, thread dumps are one of the best tools for diagnosing multithreading problems. In the best-case scenario, thread dumps will pinpoint exactly where the problem lies. At the very least, they’ll give you an idea of where to start your investigation.\nA thread dump tool captures the state of the application at a given moment and produces a structured text report on every thread in the application. You can view the report as text or use a specialized thread dump viewer, like the one in IntelliJ IDEA:\n\nThere are several tools that can capture and view thread dumps. Despite some variance in format and scope, thread dumps produced by different tools generally appear similar.\nHere’s an example of how a thread is described in a thread dump:\n\"main\" prio=5 tid=0x000001f3c9d13000 nid=NA runnable\n  java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead0(Native Method)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.socketRead(SocketInputStream.java:116)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:171)\n    at java.net.SocketInputStream.read(SocketInputStream.java:141)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.readBytes(StreamDecoder.java:284)\n      - locked  (a java.io.InputStreamReader)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.implRead(StreamDecoder.java:326)\n    at sun.nio.cs.StreamDecoder.read(StreamDecoder.java:178)\nA thread dump includes the threads’ stack traces, metadata, status, and the related locks.\nVirtual thread dumps\nSince virtual threads work differently under the hood, they require dedicated support. In addition to IntelliJ IDEA, common tools for capturing virtual threads include jcmd and jstack. As mentioned above, regular thread dump tools vary in terms of format and the level of information they provide. Your preference for one tool over another may be based on your specific use case.\nThe Netflix story\nTo make this more concrete, let’s look at an example from Netflix. For those who missed this post, we highly recommend reading it. It’s a captivating technical deep dive from engineers doing impressive things in Java, and it’s also relevant for our discussion here.\nIn short, after upgrading to virtual threads, Netflix engineers discovered an issue where some endpoints stopped serving traffic even though the JVM was still running. To get a better idea of what was going on, the team analyzed locks using a heap dump (!) and reverse-engineered Java concurrency classes. This investigation revealed a deadlock related to a limitation in virtual threads. This bug was later fixed in Java 25.\nClever though their methods may have been, it’s hard to deny that a thread dump with more comprehensive information would have made the investigation much easier.\nGetting lock information for virtual threads\nIf you use IntelliJ IDEA, you’re in luck! The IntelliJ IDEA team prioritizes new Java releases, so whenever Java adds a shiny new feature, you can rest assured that the IDE will support it from the get-go. Later in this post, we’ll discuss the capabilities of IntelliJ IDEA’s thread dump tool, but for now, let’s stick to the problem.\nUsing the gist provided in the original article, we can set a breakpoint at the line that catches the deadlock and run the reproducer while debugging:\n\nWe use a breakpoint here because the gist would otherwise finish too quickly for us to capture a thread dump in time. In real-world applications, you can capture a thread dump at any moment without suspending the program. To do this, go to More | Get thread dump on the Debug tab for the target app.\nIntelliJ IDEA opens the thread dump, indicates thread statuses, groups similar threads, folds stack traces, and provides navigation back to the source code. Selecting a waiting virtual thread shows the same information as for a platform thread, including details about the acquired locks:\n\nIn this simplified example, the virtual threads synchronize on a new Object(), so finding this specific lock isn’t particularly useful. Still, the information is there – and invaluable when diagnosing real-world problems.\nSupported targets\nIntelliJ IDEA can attach to any Java or Kotlin process, whether local or remote.\nThread dumps don’t have to come from IntelliJ IDEA at all. If someone provides a dump generated with another tool, such as jcmd, IntelliJ IDEA can open and analyze it just as easily as its own native dumps. We constantly monitor the planned changes throughout the ecosystem, so you can count on support for both the earlier and recent versions.\nAnd as a bonus for Kotlin users: IntelliJ IDEA supports not only virtual threads, but Kotlin coroutines as well!\nSummary\nJava is ramping things up and bringing modern features into the domain of concurrent computations – and this is just the beginning. Structured concurrency, a paradigm shift in how Java developers reason about concurrency, is just around the corner. We’re in this together, vendors and users alike.\nWe encourage you to give thread dumps a try in IntelliJ IDEA – you’ll find that this post was only the tip of the iceberg. And our documentation is always worth a look. For feedback and feature requests, we invite you to check out the comments section or our issue tracker.\nLet us know what you think!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "I struggled to get started. For ages, I kept putting off building this website, creating a new programming language for Visual Studio, and coming up with fresh color themes. Each project looked overwhelming, and I couldn’t find the time or motivation to jump in. It all just felt like too much at once.\nBut when a national holiday gave me a long weekend, I grabbed the chance to try out Copilot in Visual Studio and see how far I could get. To my surprise, I knocked out all three projects way faster and more easily than I expected. I’m sharing what I learned because I hope it inspires you to finally tackle those projects you’ve been putting off.\nIf you have some free time at the end of 2025, it might be the perfect opportunity to finally kickstart those ideas you’ve been meaning to work on.\nLet’s jump into how I kicked off the web development project.\nProject 1 – a static website\nA few years ago, I wrote a book called The Automated Home with little success. I wrote it mostly for myself and to help other smart home geeks come up with ideas and recipes for their own automations. A book isn’t a good format for that, so I’ve been wanting to turn it into a website for a long time.\nI exported the book from .docx to .txt so that I could feed it to Copilot in Visual Studio. Then I created an empty folder to hold the static website and opened it using File -> Open Folder.\nAnd then I went to the chat window and wrote a prompt to Copilot that went like this: “Turn this book into a website that should function like a book of recipes for home automation”.\nIt chewed on that for a while and a static website was slowly taking shape in front of my eyes. One file at a time added to Solution Explorer and opened in the editor.\nThe first result was pretty good. It had most of the content right, but the design, menu system, and content organization was suboptimal. My background as a web developer came in handy, because I knew what I wanted and how I wanted it. So, I started to be a lot more specific in my prompting and telling it how I wanted the CSS to look like etc.\nThe Home Automation Cookbook website\nThe AI was able to create this website in much less time than I would have been able to manually. Probably around 5x faster. I didn’t write much myself but would prompt the AI whenever I wanted a change. Only for small things would I do the coding manually.\nThe workflow was amazing, but it did involve quite a bit of waiting for Copilot to finish its tasks. That turned out great, because I was able to spend time with the family and make progress on the website at the same time.\nCheck it out at https://www.homeautomationcookbook.com\nProject 2 – a TOON language service\nI write Visual Studio extensions a lot, and this one has made it to the top of my to-do list. Mainly because of the challenge of creating a language parser and tokenizer that would work as a Visual Studio language service. TOON is a simple language, but even so, a language service requires some unique features I couldn’t find in any of the current TOON implementations in C#.\nThe TOON language inside Visual Studio\nTo provide syntax highlighting, syntax validation (squiggles), and other features, a language parser must be very fault tolerant. If you make a syntax error on line 10, you don’t want the rest of the file to lose syntax highlighting or be riddled with syntax violation errors. Most language parsers will simply throw an error if they see a syntax error and stop parsing completely.\nMy plan was to point the GitHub cloud agent to the TOON language specification and have it create the parser and based on that. I also wanted it to create unit tests based on the specification to validate the implementation was correct.\nI created a new .NET 10 Class Library project in Visual Studio 2026 and opened the Copilot chat window. The prompt I gave Copilot was something like “Based on the TOON specification (<url to spec>), create a parser and tokenizer that is suitable for use in a Visual Studio language service”.\nThe Copilot prompt for creating a TOON language parser showing the new Cloud Agent button\nOnce I clicked the Cloud Agent button to feed it my prompt, Visual Studio starts gathering the information it needs to come up with a plan. Once it does, it creates an issue on the GitHub repository with the information and then assigns GitHub’s cloud agent to the task.\nIn about 20 minutes, I received a pull request with the initial implementation by the cloud agent. It was a good first try, but more work was needed to make it work the way I wanted. I used a mix of both regular agent mode and the cloud agent to make further improvements.\nOver 600 tests created to validate the parser against the official TOON language specification\nI found that the cloud agent was most helpful when it came to isolated tasks. I could simply prompt it to begin the work in the background, while I did other work in Visual Studio. That way I had two workstreams going on in parallel and I could make headway fast.\nOnce complete, I asked the agent to make the class library into a NuGet package and set up automated CI/CD using GitHub Actions. I published the Toon Tokenizer package shortly thereafter and could now start working on the Visual Studio extension.\nThis is my wheelhouse. And once I created a new extension project, I could simply add the NuGet package and go to town. I did this part manually because I really enjoy extension development, so I wanted to do all the driving.\nThis was a super fun project, and I got to play around with the Profiler Agent to fine tune the parser performance. I also asked the agent to help find any security issues and mitigate them. It was able to find and fix some potential risks. Overall, a fantastic experience that turned out so much better than I could imagine. This was another 5-10x time saver thanks to Copilot.\nCheck out the Toon extension and parser repository.\nProject 3 – new color themes\nI’ve wanted to make some new color themes for Visual Studio for a long time. But it’s a type of extension I don’t have much experience with, so I wasn’t sure about how much effort would be required. Often, the unknown amount of time and effort is what makes me procrastinate on projects.\nTo kick this one off, I decided to use my old Blue Steel theme extension as the base. I wanted to create two solarized themes. The real challenge with this one was to map the color tokens with the right color codes. All I had was screenshots of the themes from the Solarized web page.\nIt looks like this:\nSolarized color theme from the official web page\nWith the screenshots, I asked Copilot to extract the color tokens for both the shell/environment and the code syntax colors and map them to the right color tokens in the VS XML theme file.\nThose XML files contain a bunch of categories with color tokens in each.\n<Category Name=\"Shell\" GUID=\"{73708ded-2d56-4aad-b8eb-73b20d3f4bff}\">\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"E56C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"AccentFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"CC6C71C4\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillTertiary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SolidBackgroundFillQuaternary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFEEE8D5\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"SurfaceBackgroundFillDefault\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFFDF6E3\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n     <Color Name=\"TextFillSecondary\">\r\n             <Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" />\r\n     </Color>\r\n</Category>\nCopilot did a fantastic job, but I had to play around with the colors a bit. There was still a bunch of manual finessing needed. But it gave me a jump start that saved me a lot of time.\nI ended up adding 6 new color themes to the Blue Steel extension.\nThe Solarized Dark color theme for Visual Studio 2026\nIf you’re interested in creating your own color theme(s) for Visual Studio, I suggest you clone the GitHub repo to get started. Make sure to change the GUID in both the .vstheme files and in the .vsixmanifest file to avoid conflicting with the original.\nIn conclusion\nIf Copilot hadn’t given me a running start, I probably wouldn’t have even started these projects. It would’ve been way more work. And honestly, it is not nearly as fun or satisfying. Seeing things come together quickly is super motivating and really helps keep you going until you finish.\nAgentic development was awesome for a lot of the work that went into these projects, but there were times I just wanted to do things the old-school way. Sometimes I just enjoy doing certain tasks myself, or it’s simply quicker to make some tweaks by hand.\nIn any event, these were fun to do. And I finally shipped what I’ve been wanting to do for so long.\nThe post How AI fixed my procrastination appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

'비 오는 밤 성수동 카페', '새벽 3시 집중력을 높이는 로파이'처럼 구체적인 상황과 감성을 담은 컨셉을 잡아야 하는데, 여기서부터 많은 분들이 막막함을 느꼈을 거예요. 게다가 저작권 걱정 없이 좋은 음원을 확보하는 건 또 다른 큰 산이었습니다. 유튜브 오디오 보관함이나 NCS 같은 무료 음원도 있지만, 너무 많은 사람들이 사용해서 차별화가 어렵다는 단점이 있었죠.\n  AI 음원의 등장: 요즘은 수노(Suno AI)나 유디오(Udio) 같은 AI로 직접 음원을 만드는 추세예요. 하지만 이것도 처음에는 '프롬프트'를 어떻게 작성해야 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있을지 정말 어렵게 느껴질 수 있습니다.\n2. 시각 자료 제작의 복잡성\n음악만 계속 틀어놓으면 시청자들이 금세 지루함을 느낄 수 있죠. 그래서 배경 영상이나 이미지가 필수인데, 미드저니(Midjourney)나 캔바(Canva) 같은 도구를 배우는 것도 일이었어요. 거기서 끝이 아니죠! 정적인 이미지에 오디오 스펙트럼 같은 움직임을 더해서 시청자의 시선을 사로잡아야 했습니다. 그런데 이런 효과를 넣으려면 프리미어 프로나 캡컷(CapCut) 같은 전문 영상 편집 프로그램을 배워야 하니, 이 단계에서 좌절하는 분들이 많았을 겁니다.\n3. 긴 영상 편집과 렌더링의 고통\n배경 영상 위에 음원을 배치하고, 화면 하단에 곡 제목을 표시하고, 여러 영상 효과를 반영하는 것 자체가 어려운 작업입니다. 특히 플레이리스트 영상처럼 1시간 이상의 긴 영상을 원활하게 편집하고 렌더링하려면 앞서 언급한 전문 영상 편집 프로그램은 거의 필수적이죠. 배우는 것도 어렵지만, 저사양 컴퓨터로는 렌더링에만 반나절이 걸리는 경우도 허다해서 '대체 언제 다 만들지?' 하는 생각이 절로 들었습니다.\n\n\n4. 시간 소모와 초기 노출의 한계\n이 모든 과정을 숙련자가 해도 영상 하나 만드는 데 최소 3시간에서 5시간은 족히 걸렸습니다. 기획/선곡 1~2시간, 시각 자료 제작 30분~1시간, 편집/렌더링 1~2시간, 유튜브 업로드/SEO 30분… 매일 이렇게 작업하려면 정말 힘들었겠죠? 게다가 이미 로파이걸 같은 거대 채널들이 시장을 장악하고 있어서 신규 채널이 알고리즘의 선택을 받기까지는 최소 3~6개월 이상의 꾸준한 노력이 필요했습니다. 매번 새로운 무드를 찾아내고 수십 곡의 리스트를 짜는 작업은 창의적인 에너지를 엄청나게 소모하며 소재 고갈에 빠지기 쉬웠고요.\n하지만 오늘 제가 소개해드릴 방법은 이 모든 과정을 획기적으로 단축시켜줍니다. 특히 AI 도구를 활용하면 저작권 문제에서 훨씬 자유롭고, 제작 시간도 놀랍도록 줄일 수 있으니, 정말 솔깃하지 않나요? 이제 본격적으로 강력한 두 가지 앱을 소개해드릴게요!\n  AI 플레이리스트 제작, 시작 전 준비물!\n자, 그럼 이 놀라운 AI 도구들을 사용하기 전에 몇 가지 준비할 것이 있습니다. 생각보다 간단하니 걱정 마세요!\n구글 아이디 및 API 발급: 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 제미나이를 기반으로 작동하는 'AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터'를 사용하려면 구글 AI 스튜디오 사용을 위한 구글 아이디와 API 발급이 필요해요. API 발급 방법은 제가 다른 영상에서 상세히 다뤘으니, 본문이나 댓글에 있는 링크를 참고하셔서 먼저 발급받아주세요.\nSuno AI 가입: 음악 생성을 위해 suno.com에 접속하셔서 간단하게 가입해주셔야 합니다.\n⚠️ 중요! Suno AI 유료 플랜: Suno AI에서 생성한 음원을 유튜브 수익 창출이나 음원 발매 등 상업적으로 활용하려면 반드시 유료 플랜에 가입해야 합니다. 이 점 꼭 기억해 주세요!\n이 두 가지 준비물이 갖춰졌다면, 이제 본격적으로 AI와 함께 플레이리스트 채널을 만드는 여정을 시작해볼까요?\n  AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터: 기획부터 썸네일까지 원스톱!\n이 앱은 구글의 최신 AI 모델인 제미나이를 기반으로 작동하는데요. 단순히 아이디어만 툭 던져주는 수준이 아닙니다. 실제 음악 생성에 필요한 전문적인 프롬프트부터 채널 운영에 필수적인 모든 요소를 그야말로 원스톱으로 제공해줘요. 제가 직접 써보니, 정말이지 '이게 되네?' 싶을 정도로 놀라웠습니다.\n\n\n✨ AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터의 핵심 기능 4가지\n클릭을 부르는 감성적인 제목 생성: '재즈 음악'처럼 평범한 제목이 아닌, 이모지와 감성적인 문구, 그리고 검색 키워드까지 고려한 매력적인 제목을 뽑아줍니다. 예를 들어, ' ️ 비 오는 밤, 따뜻한 커피와 함께 듣는 감성 재즈'처럼요.\nSuno 5.0에 최적화된 프롬프트 생성: 단순히 '재즈 만들어줘'가 아닙니다. 악기 구성, 공간감, 연주 스타일까지 아주 디테일하게 작성된 전문적인 프롬프트를 생성해줘요. 여러분은 그저 복사해서 Suno AI에 붙여넣기만 하면 끝입니다!\n맞춤형 가사 생성: 인트로, 벌스, 코러스 같은 곡 구조를 설정해서 가사를 뽑을 수 있고요. 가사가 없는 연주곡 모드도 지원하니, 다양한 컨셉을 시도해볼 수 있습니다.\n가장 중요한, 고퀄리티 썸네일 자동 생성: 배경에 'PLAYLIST'라는 문구가 자연스럽게 들어간 고퀄리티 이미지를 생성하고, 그 위에 원하는 감성 폰트로 제목까지 합성해줍니다. 포토샵 같은 전문 프로그램은 전혀 필요 없어요. 정말 정말 편리하죠!\n ️ AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터 사용법 (단계별 가이드)\n사용 편의성을 위해 화면을 양쪽으로 나누어 'AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터'와 'Suno AI'를 함께 실행하는 것을 추천해요. 그러면 작업 효율이 훨씬 높아집니다.\n장르 선택: 앱 첫 화면에서 플레이리스트 채널에서 가장 인기 있는 장르를 선택합니다. 만약 원하는 장르가 없다면 직접 입력할 수도 있어요. (예시: 로파이(Lo-Fi) 장르 선택)\n제목 선택: 선택한 장르에 적합한 제목 리스트가 생성되면, 그중 마음에 드는 감성적인 제목을 고릅니다. (예시: '비오는 날 창밖 보며 멍 때리기 좋은 감성' 선택)\n프롬프트 및 가사 설정: 화면이 바뀌면 왼쪽에 Suno AI용 프롬프트가 나타나요. 오른쪽에서는 생성할 가사의 언어와 곡 수를 선택하고, 곡의 구성을 설정합니다. 앱이 사용자가 선택한 내용에 적합한 곡 구성을 미리 추천해 주니 정말 편리하죠. 그 다음 가사에 적용할 비유와 은유의 정도를 선택하고, 인트로/아웃트로에도 가사를 포함할지 결정한 후 가사를 생성합니다. 연주곡을 원한다면 '가사 없음'을 선택하면 됩니다.\nSEO 정보 생성 및 저장: 빠른 유튜브 SEO 작업을 위해 영상 제목, 설명, 해시태그, 키워드를 생성하는 기능이 있어요. 이걸 메모장에 미리 복사해두면 나중에 정말 유용하게 쓸 수 있습니다.\nSuno AI로 음악 생성: AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터에서 생성된 Suno AI용 프롬프트를 복사하여 Suno AI의 스타일 칸에 붙여넣습니다. 가사가 생성되면 제목과 가사를 각각 복사한 후 Suno AI에 붙여넣기 하고 'Create' 버튼을 클릭하여 곡을 생성합니다.\n썸네일 생성 및 다운로드: 곡이 생성되는 동안 유튜브 썸네일 탭으로 이동하여 스타일과 폰트를 선택한 후 '생성' 버튼을 클릭합니다. 플레이리스트 제목이 멋지게 적용된 썸네일이 생성되는데, 수정사항이 있다면 입력하여 이미지의 일관성을 유지한 채 원하는 내용만 수정할 수 있습니다. 마음에 드는 썸네일은 바로 다운로드하세요!\n곡 다운로드: Suno AI에서 생성된 로파이 음악을 들어보고, 만족스럽다면 가사만큼 같은 작업을 반복하여 곡을 생성한 후 모두 다운로드합니다.\n  스펙트럼 스튜디오: 영상 편집 없이 전문가급 영상 만들기!\n이제 Suno AI로 만든 음악 파일을 가지고 '스펙트럼 스튜디오'를 활용해 실제 플레이리스트 영상을 만들어 볼 차례입니다. 이 도구는 정말이지 혁신적이라고 생각해요. 복잡한 영상 편집 프로그램 없이도 브라우저에서 바로 유튜브 플레이리스트 영상을 만들 수 있는 웹 기반 도구거든요!\n\n\n\n프리미어 프로나 파이널컷 같은 전문 편집 프로그램을 따로 배우지 않아도 되고, 프로그램을 설치할 필요도 없이 인터넷 브라우저만 있으면 어디서든 사용할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적입니다. 게다가, 앞서 소개한 AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터와 달리 AI 기능을 사용하지 않기 때문에 API 발급도 필요 없고, 가입만 하면 바로 사용할 수 있어요. 접근성이 정말 좋죠?\n  스펙트럼 스튜디오의 독보적인 강점 5가지\n환상적인 오디오 스펙트럼 기능: 음악에 반응해서 실시간으로 움직이는 시각화 효과를 만들어줍니다. 막대형, 원형, 파형 등 다양한 스타일을 선택할 수 있고, 색상부터 반응 민감도까지 세밀하게 조정해서 나만의 감성을 표현할 수 있어요.\n로고 배경 자동 제거: 포토샵 없이도 클릭 한 번으로 로고 배경을 깔끔하게 제거하여 영상에 자연스럽게 합성할 수 있습니다. 채널의 브랜딩을 강화하는 데 아주 유용하죠.\n감성적인 특수 효과와 필터: 물방울, 반짝이는 입자, 빈티지 필터 등을 추가하여 영상을 훨씬 풍성하고 감성적으로 만들 수 있습니다. 시청자들의 눈을 즐겁게 해줄 거예요.\n타임라인 자동 복사 기능: 버튼 한 번으로 유튜브 설명란에 들어갈 곡 제목과 시간 정보가 자동으로 복사됩니다. 일일이 시간을 적을 필요가 없으니 정말이지 시간을 엄청나게 아낄 수 있습니다!\n빠르고 안전한 로컬 렌더링 방식: 여러분의 파일을 서버로 보내지 않고 PC에서 바로 처리하기 때문에 개인정보 유출 걱정이 없고, 렌더링 속도도 빠르며 안전합니다.\n이 모든 강점 덕분에 2시간짜리 플레이리스트 영상을 편집부터 렌더링 완료까지 40분에서 50분이면 충분하다고 합니다. 기존 방식으로는 몇 시간씩 걸리던 작업을 1시간 안에 끝낼 수 있다니, 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n⚙️ 스펙트럼 스튜디오 사용법 (단계별 가이드)\n음악 파일 업로드: Suno AI에서 작업한 음악 파일을 스펙트럼 스튜디오에 업로드합니다. 업로드한 파일의 재생 순서도 변경할 수 있으니 참고하세요.\n타임라인 복사: 상단에 있는 타임라인 복사 버튼을 클릭하면, 해당 곡으로 바로 이동할 수 있는 타임라인이 자동으로 생성됩니다. 이것도 메모장에 복사해 두면 유튜브 업로드 시 매우 유용해요.\n이미지 및 로고 등록: 앞서 AI 플레이리스트 크리에이터에서 만들어둔 썸네일 이미지를 등록합니다. 채널 로고가 있다면 함께 업로드할 수 있어요.\n재생 설정: 전체 음악을 몇 번 반복할지 재생 횟수를 선택하고 오디오 품질도 선택한 후 편집 스튜디오로 넘어갑니다.\n편집 스튜디오 설정:\n\n오디오 스펙트럼: 왼쪽에서 막대형, 미니막대형, 원형, 파형 등 다양한 스타일을 선택하고, 오른쪽 아래에서 스펙트럼의 위치, 크기, 스타일 등 세부 속성을 변경합니다.\n로고 조정: 오른쪽 위에서 업로드한 로고 이미지의 크기와 위치를 조절하고, 배경 제거 기능을 활용하여 깔끔하게 적용할 수 있습니다.\n배경 효과: 왼쪽 아래에서는 배경 이미지에 다양한 필터와 비네팅 효과를 줄 수 있습니다.\n특수 효과: 바로 아래에는 배경 이미지 위에 움직이는 물방울과 반짝임 특수효과를 적용하고, 이 효과들의 속성을 제어하는 특별한 기능이 있습니다.\n비디오 내보내기: 모든 설정이 완료되면 우측 상단의 '비디오 내보내기'를 클릭하고, 다음 화면에서 'MP4 렌더링 시작'을 클릭합니다. 저장할 파일명 설정 후 바로 렌더링이 시작되며, 짧은 시간 안에 고품질 영상이 완성됩니다.\n✅ 완성된 플레이리스트 영상, 유튜브에 업로드하기!\n이제 대망의 마지막 단계입니다!

        "contentSnippet": "안녕하세요. 이번 글은 Gemini CLI, SpecKit, Supabase, Vercel을 활용해 QnA 시스템을 구현하는 내용에 대해 작성한 글입니다.\nGemini CLI 설정부터 SpecKit을 사용하는 흐름, Supabase 설정 및 UI 개선하는 과정을 담았습니다.\n키워드 : Gemini CLI 사용법, Gemini CLI with SpecKit, Supabase, Vercel, Gemini Code Assist\n\n\nGemini CLI\n소개\nGemini CLI는 Google의 AI 모델(Gemini)을 CLI 환경에서 사용할 수 있게 해주는 개발자 도구\n최근 터미널 기반의 제품이 많이 나오는데, 직접 사용해보면 생산성이 많이 좋아지는 것을 느낄 수 있음\nGemini 모델의 장점 때문에 Gemini CLI를 쓰게 됨\n    \n(1) 긴 컨텍스트 : 컨텍스트를 많이 넣을 수 있기 때문에 복잡한 작업, 많은 컨텍스트가 필요할 때 유리\n(2) 가격 : Gemini 모델의 가격은 다른 모델의 가격 대비 엄청 저렴함(특히 Gemini Flash Lite가 저렴해서 자주 사용함)\n공식 문서, Docs\nGemini CLI 설치\nGemini CLI는 Node.js 환경에서 동작하므로, 사전에 Node.js가 설치되어 있어야 함\n    \n만약 Node가 설치되어 있지 않다면 Node.js 페이지를 확인해서 Node 설치\nnpm으로 글로벌하게 설치\n\n  npm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n\n    \nGemini CLI 실행\n터미널에서 gemini 입력 후 엔터\n    \n만약 첫 실행이면 인증 방식을 선택하게 됨\n구글 계정 로그인, API Key 방식, 구글 클라우드의 Vertex AI를 통해 인증할 수 있음\n저는 Gemini를 구독하고 있어서 구글 로그인으로 선택함\n\n/model을 입력하면 모델을 선택할 수 있음\n    \nPro (gemini-3-pro-preview, gemini-2.5-pro)로 설정\n\nGemini CLI 주요 명령어\n명령어\n      설명\n    \n/help\n      사용 가능한 명령어 목록 확인\n    \n/model\n      모델 선택 (gemini-3-pro 등)\n    \n/memory show\n      현재 로드된 GEMINI.md 내용 확인\n    \n/memory refresh\n      GEMINI.md 파일 다시 로드\n    \n/memory add <text>\n      메모리에 텍스트 추가\n    \n/chat\n      대화 저장/불러오기/공유\n    \n/chat save <tag>\n      현재 대화를 태그로 저장\n    \n/chat resume <tag>\n      저장된 대화 이어서 진행\n    \n/mcp\n      MCP 서버 목록 및 상태 확인\n    \n/tools\n      사용 가능한 도구 목록\n    \n/stats\n      토큰 사용량, 세션 시간 등 통계\n    \n/restore\n      체크포인트로 롤백 (파일 변경 전 상태)\n    \n/clear\n      터미널 화면 초기화 (Ctrl+L)\n    \n/compress\n      대화 컨텍스트를 요약해서 토큰 절약\n    \n/copy\n      마지막 응답을 클립보드에 복사\n    \n/settings\n      설정 편집기 열기\n    \nstats 입력시 아래와 같이 Session의 통계 정보를 제공함\n\nExtensions\n    \n다양한 Extensions이 존재하며, 설치하고 싶으면 아래와 같이 실행(나노바나나 Extension)\n\n  gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/nanobanana\n\n    \nGEMINI.md 설정\nGEMINI.md는 Gemini CLI에게 프로젝트 Context와 작업 규칙(Rules)을 알려주는 설정 파일\n    \n이 파일에 작성한 내용은 모든 대화에서 시스템 프롬프트처럼 적용됨\nGemini CLI는 여러 위치의 GEMINI.md를 자동으로 찾아서 합쳐줌\n    \n아래 순서대로 로드되며, 모든 파일의 내용이 합쳐짐. 같은 항목에 대해 충돌이 있으면 하위 파일이 우선 적용됨(프로젝트가 글로벌보다 더 우선 적용)\n\n  # 1) 글로벌(모든 프로젝트 공통) : 공통 규칙, 한국어 사용 등\n  ~/.gemini/GEMINI.md      \n\t\n  # 2) 프로젝트 루트 : 기술 스택, 구조 위주\n  /project-root/GEMINI.md \n\t\n  # 3) 하위 디렉토리(해당 폴더에서 작업할 경우)\n  /project-root/src/GEMINI.md\n\n    \n현재 로드된 컨텍스트는 /memory show 명령어로 확인할 수 있으며, CLI 하단에 로드된 파일 개수가 표시됨\nGEMINI.md에 자주 들어가는 내용\n    \n기술 스택 : Python 3.13\n코딩 컨벤션 : 네이밍 컨벤션\n프로젝트 구조 : 폴더 설명\n에러 처리 방식, API 호출 패턴\n금지 사항 : 특정 라이브러리 사용 금지\n참고 문서 : @로 외부 파일 import 가능\n다른 파일을 Import해서 불러오고 싶을 때는 @을 사용함. 프로젝트 문서나 스타일 가이드를 분리해서 관리할 때 유용함\n\n  # GEMINI.md \n\t\n  ## Project Context \n  @docs/architecture.md \n  @docs/api-spec.md \n\n    \nGEMINI.md를 수정했으면 /memory refresh로 반영해야 함\n컨텍스트가 길다고 좋은 것은 아니므로 이 파일도 계속 관리해야 함\n\n\nSpecKit을 활용한 SDD 개발\n소개\nSpecKit은 GitHub에서 만든 오픈소스로 SDD(Spec Driven Development) 도구\n    \nAI 코딩 에이전트(Gemini CLI, Claude Code 등)와 함께 사용하도록 설계됨\n만들어진 계기\n    \nAI에게 그냥 A 만들어줘라고 하면 의도와 다르게 나오거나 아키텍처가 엉망인 경우가 많음. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 SpecKit은 코드 작성 전에 Spec을 정의하고 이를 기반으로 AI가 구현하도록 유도함\n이 Spec을 사람이 리뷰하면 되고, 리뷰하는 과정도 이 도구 사용법 안에 자연스레 존재함\n    \n코드보다 이 Spec을 더 잘 관리하고, 잘 작성하는 것이 중요하다는 의견이 있는데, 저도 동의함. 기본적인 문서 작성이 더 중요해지는 시기\nWorkflow 흐름\n    \n크게 6단계로 설명할 수 있음\n(1) Specify : 기능 요구사항 정의(기술 스택이 아닌 무엇을 만들지)\n(2) Clarify : 애매한 부분, 의사결정이 필요한 부분을 질문하며 구체화\n(3) Plan : 기술 스택, 아키텍처 등 계획을 세움\n(4) Tasks : Plan을 기반으로 구현할 Task 생성\n(5) Analyze : Spec과 Task의 일관성 검증\n(6) Implement : Task 기반으로 코드 구현\nSpecKit 설치하기\nPython의 uv 설치\n\n  curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n    \nSpecKit 글로벌 설치\n\n  uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git\n\n    \nSpecKit 프로젝트 설정\nSpecKit 프로젝트 초기 설정\n\n  specify init ask-kyleschool --ai gemini\n\n    \n만약 이미 폴더가 생성되어 있고, 현재 폴더에서 설정하고 싶은 경우\n\n  cd existing-project \n  specify init . --ai gemini\n\n    \n\n이제 .gemini 폴더와 .specify 폴더를 보면 SpecKit 관련 파일들이 생성된 것을 볼 수 있음\n\nGemini CLI에서도 커맨드가 보임\n\nSpecKit을 활용한 개발\n위에서 소개한 6단계를 실제로 진행\n단계\n      명령어\n      설명\n    \n1.

JSON 다운로드를 해두는 것을 추천(잃어버리지 않도록 주의. 다운로드 폴더에 그대로 두지 않기)\n\n이제 Supabase로 돌아와서 Authentication - Sign In / Providers - Google을 선택\n\nEnable Sign in with Google을 설정하고 위에서 만든 클라이언트 id와 클라이언트 secret 값을 붙여넣기\n    \n하단에 있는 Callback URL 값은 이후에 사용할 예정이므로 복사 클릭\n\n다시 구글 클라우드의 Client쪽에 다음과 같이 추가\n    \n승인된 JavaScript 원본 : 실행시킬 URL 입력. 지금은 배포하지 않고 제 로컬에서 실행할 예정이라 localhost:3000만 추가함\n        \n나중에 배포하면 배포한 URL 웹페이지를 입력하면 됨\n승인된 리디렉션 URI : 위에 Google 로그인에서 복사한 Callback URL 입력\n\n\n\n개발 결과 확인\n이제 인프라 설정이 완료되었으므로, 터미널에서 아래 명령어 실행해서 개발 결과 확인\n\nnpm run dev\n\n\nlocalhost:3000으로 접속하면 다음과 같이 뜸\n\n구글로 로그인을 시도하니 정상적으로 로그인 완료\n로그인 후 닉네임 설정을 하게 됨\n\n강의 페이지로 이동\n\n‘BigQuery 쿼리를 실행하기 위한 기본적인 쿼리 구성 요소를 알려주세요’라고 질문함\n\n그 결과 질문이 올라옴\n\n답변은 다음과 같이 달림. 단, 마크다운 설정이 필요할 것 같음\n\n만약 실행하는 과정에서 오류가 발생하면 Gemini CLI에게 오류를 보내고 수정하라고 가이드하면 됨. 만약 반복된다면 전체적으로 점검하라고 요청하는 것을 추천\n\n\nUI 개선\n새로운 Spec을 통해 디자인 개선하기\n기능 구현은 되었고, 디자인을 개선하기 위해 다시 Spec을 작성함\n\n위에서 진행한 것처럼 clarify, plan, tasks, analyze, implement를 실행한 후 기다림\n    \n이제 마크다운을 잘 표현하고, 디자인이 살짝 개선됨\n\n더 자세한 지시를 통해 디자인 개선하기\n만들어진 디자인이 마음에 들지 않아 어떻게 개선할지 고민하다가, Claude Code의 frontend-design 스킬을 참고해서 개선하라고 지시함\nGEMINI.md 파일에 아래 내용을 추가함\n\n  ## Frontend Design\n  - Please refer to @frontend-design.md when implementing frontend designs\n\n    \nGEMINI.md를 수정한 후, 해당 지시를 기반으로 디자인을 개선하라고 지시함\n\n처음 버전보다 더 세련된 느낌. 만약 내가 원하는 방향성이 있다면 디자인 레퍼런스를 구체적으로 줄수록 만족스러운 결과가 나올 수 있음\n\n\nGemini CLI에게 아이디어 문의\n이제 또 무엇을 하면 좋을지 아이디어를 물어봤더니, 좋은 아이디어를 줬음\n\n위 내용을 모두 모아서 하나의 Spec으로 정의해서 구현해달라고 지시함\n    \n강의 클릭시 대기 시간에 system_log 형식으로 구현함\n\n\nGemini Code Assist를 활용한 AI 코드 리뷰\n이제 GitHub에 Push함. 처음 작업이라 main에 바로 Push했으나, 그 이후엔 브랜치를 새롭게 만들어서 확인하는 것을 추천함\nGemini Code Assist를 설치하면 GitHub에서 Pull Request가 발생할 때 코드를 Gemini가 리뷰해줌. 이 설정을 해두는 것을 추천\n설정\nGemini Code Assist GitHub App 페이지 이동 -> Configure 클릭\n\n로그인을 완료한 후, 사용할 GitHub Repository를 추가\n\nAI 코드 리뷰 결과\n이렇게 설정한 후, Pull Request를 하면 아래와 같이 리뷰가 달림(아래 리뷰는 다른 Repo에서 Gemini Code Assist가 리뷰한 내용을 가져옴)\n\n\n\n\nVercel 배포\nSupabase와 Vercel이 잘 통합되어 있으므로, Vercel을 통해 배포하는 것을 추천\n이 부분에 대해 글을 작성할 예정은 아니였지만, 간단하게라도 가이드를 남겨봄\nVercel - New Project를 누르면 GitHub에서 Import를 할 수 있음\n\n\nSupabase URL, Anon Key를 추가하면 어렵지 않게 배포할 수 있음\nVercel 배포가 완료되면 새로운 URL이 생성됨. 이 URL을 Google Cloud OAuth(위에 소셜 로그인 부분)에 가서 승인된 JavaScript 원본에 Vercel URL을 추가해야 함\n그리고 Supabase에서도 URL 설정을 추가해야 함\n    \nSupabase > Authentication > URL Configuration에서 Site URL을 Vercel URL로 변경\n\n\n후기\nGemini CLI도 많이 사용하면서 도구에 적응하게 됨. 이런 도구들은 실제로 써보고, 피드백 루프를 돌리는 과정이 필요함\nGemini CLI의 Release Notes를 보면 새로운 기능들이 계속 생기고 있음. 앞으로 계속 더 발전할 것 같음\nClaude Code와 Gemini CLI 둘 다 사용하게 되었는데, 필요에 맞게 사용할 수 있도록 계속 시도해볼 예정\n    \nGemini CLI가 컨텍스트가 많기 때문에 핵심 AI 에이전트로 쓰고, Gemini CLI에서 Claude Code나 Codex를 실행하게 하는 것도 방법이고, 이미 이런 시도를 하는 분들이 계심\nAI 에이전트 도구들의 설정을 동일하게 저장해서 (예를 들어 AGENT.md를 만들어서) 관리하는 것이 필요할 듯. 새로운 도구로 이사하는 것이 번거롭게 느껴질 수 있음\n\n\n\n이 글은 GDE 프로그램에서 진행한 AI Sprint에 참여하며 작성한 글입니다.\n\nGoogle Cloud credits are provided for this project. #AISprint",
