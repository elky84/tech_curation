        "content:encodedSnippet": "In this post, we explore the ways we’re evolving Meta’s data warehouse to facilitate productivity and security to serve both human users and AI agents. \nWe detail how we’re developing agents that help users making data access requests to get to the data they need, and that help data owners process requests and maintain security. \nWe share how we’re using guardrails, including auditing and feedback systems, to ensure agents operate within set boundaries and to evaluate the overall process.\nAs part of its offline data systems, Meta operates a data warehouse that supports use cases across analytics, ML, and AI. Given the sheer volume of data, the scale of our systems, and the diverse use cases built on top, data warehouse security is very important. Teams across Meta both manage access and use that data in their day-to-day work. As the scale continues to grow and the data access patterns become more complex, the complexity of managing access and the time spent to obtain access keep increasing. How do we minimize security risks and enable teams to operate efficiently? With the rise of GenAI and agents, we needed to rethink how we can enhance security and productivity with agents, making them an integral part of our internal data products, capable of both streamlining data access and minimizing risk. In this post, we will share our work. \n\nBackground\nIn the past, we scaled data access and management by organizing the data warehouse into a hierarchical structure, as shown below in Figure 1. At the leaf of this hierarchy are tables, with pipelines producing them and dashboards consuming them. On-calls manage these assets, followed by teams and organizational hierarchies. Using role-based access control, we further modeled business needs as roles, aligning with this hierarchical structure and other dimensions, such as data semantics. \nHowever, with the growth in AI, timely access of data has become increasingly important. As the scale of data warehouses continues to grow and data access patterns become more complex, the complexity and amount of time spent on managing and obtaining access keep increasing. \nFigure 1: Data warehouse in resource hierarchy\nTo understand how we have handled this traditionally, and why that is becoming increasingly challenging, it helps to visualize the data flow through Meta’s offline infrastructure as a graph, as shown in Figure 2 below. Each node in this graph is an asset, such as a table, a column, or a dashboard, and each edge in this graph is an activity. \nTraditionally, when most of the data analytics was rules-driven, this graph was highly partitioned, and all data-access decisions were local. Engineers who wanted to use the data could discover the data by asking their teammates or looking at other people’s code. On the access-approval front, access could be granted to members of closely related teams. But with the ability of AI systems to process data across different portions of the data graph, such human-driven decisions are becoming challenging.\nFigure 2: Data warehouse as a data graph\nFigure 3 below illustrates that as humans and agents work more frequently across domains, the system complexity increases, both in terms of data scale and the dynamics of access, with AI being a major driver of these complex access patterns. However, we believe AI can also offer solutions to these challenges. With recent advancements in AI, particularly with agents, we’ve needed to evolve our previous approach to an agentic solution for data access. Additionally, while the system was originally designed for humans to operate and to serve both humans and services, we needed to adapt it for agents and humans working together. The new agentic workflow must natively integrate into data products and create a streamlined experience. We also must create strict guardrails, such as analytical rule-based risk assessment, to safeguard the agents.\nFigure 3: Challenges to scale and streamline data access\nUser and owner agents\nWe modeled the solution as a multi-agent system, as shown in Figure 4 below. Data-user agents assist data users in obtaining access, while data-owner agents help data owners manage access. These two agents also collaborate to streamline the process when both parties are involved. We intentionally separate the two agents to decompose the problem, allowing each to have its own focus.\nFigure 4: How to model the problem for agents to solve\nLook closer at the data-user agent illustrated below in Figure 5. It’s not a monolithic entity; instead, it’s composed of three specialized sub-agents, each focusing on a specific, separate task, and is coordinated by a triage agent.\nFigure 5: Data-user agent\nThe first sub-agent suggests alternatives. For instance, when users encounter restricted tables, alternative options are often available, including unrestricted or less-restrictive tables. The agent also assists users in rewriting queries to use only non-restricted columns or in utilizing curated analyses. These insights are often hidden or considered tribal knowledge. Large language models and agents allow us to synthesize this information and guide users at scale.\nThe second sub-agent facilitates low-risk data exploration. Typically, users often need access to only a small fraction of a table’s data, especially during the data-exploration phase of analysis workflows. This sub-agent provides context-aware, task-specific data access for low-risk exploration. We will dive deeper into this below.\nThe third sub-agent helps users obtain access by crafting permission requests and negotiating with data-owner agents. Currently, we maintain a human-in-the-loop for oversight, but over time, we expect these sub-agents will operate more autonomously.\nThe data-owner agent is also composed of several sub-agents, including one for handling security operations and another for assisting with access management, as shown below in Figure 6.\nFigure 6: Data-owner agent\nThe first data-owner sub-agent, focused on security operations, acts like a junior engineer who assists the team with security tasks. It follows the SOP (standard operating procedure) provided by the data owner, typically derived from documented rules or guidelines, to handle incoming permission requests.\nThe second sub-agent proactively configures access rules for the team. This represents an evolution from the traditional role-mining process, where agents enable us to better utilize semantics and content. \nData warehouse for agents\nAs we mentioned at the outset, we organized the data warehouse in a hierarchical structure to scale out access. How do we evolve it with the agentic system?\nLLMs communicate through text. The hierarchical structure of the data warehouse provides a convenient way to convert warehouse resources into text, much like a nested folder structure, as depicted in Figure 7 below. Here, organizing units are represented as folders, while leaf nodes such as tables, dashboards, policies, or other entities are represented as resources. This setup gives agents a read-only summarized view of the data warehouse. The SOP we discussed earlier, which documents data-access practices from rules, wikis, and past interactions, becomes a resource that can be represented in text format. It serves as input for both data-user agents to guide users and data-owner agents to manage access.\nFigure 7: Data warehouse as resources\nIn addition to organizing inputs for agents to use, another crucial aspect is context management. Here, we differentiate among three scenarios, as shown below in Figure 8. The first scenario is called “automatic context.” Imagine data users discovering data they want to access, only to find their access blocked by controls. The system is aware of who is trying to access what, allowing the agent to fetch the exact context. The second scenario is “static context.” This occurs when users choose to focus on a specific scope explicitly or expand the resource from an automatic context to a broader one. The last scenario is “dynamic context.” It allows agents to further filter resources by metadata, such as data semantics, or via similarity search.\nFigure 8: Context management\nAnother key area is intention management. In the context of data access, we often refer to this as  “business needs.” What drives a data user to access certain resources? As shown in Figure 9 below, we model user intention in two ways: explicit and implicit.\nFigure 9: Intention management\nIn explicit intention management, users explicitly communicate their intentions to the system. For example, when using certain data tools to access data, they can inform the system of their current task by assuming an associated role, which carries the context of the business needs. This approach captures standard intentions.\nThe second is implicit intention. Not every intention can be modeled by roles. That’s where dynamic intention comes in. The system infers intention from a data user’s activities over a short period. For example, if a data user is woken up at midnight to address a pipeline failure, any subsequent data access is likely related to resolving that issue.\nDeep dive: Partial data preview\nNow, let’s dive into how all these elements come together to enable a complete end-to-end use case, which we refer to as partial data preview.\nTo quickly recap: In our data-access agentic solution, we have data-user agents that assist data users in obtaining access, and data-owner agents that help data owners manage and operate data access. Typically, a data user’s workflow begins with data discovery, followed by data exploration, before diving into full-fledged data analysis. During the exploration phase, there’s usually interaction with a small amount of data exposure. So, how do we enable more task-specific, context-aware access at this stage of data access?\nTo make the system work seamlessly end to end, four key capabilities (illustrated below in Figure 10) are orchestrated by an agentic workflow: \nContext. We analyze data-user activities and other information to understand the business needs driving data access and align them with data controls. This enables us to provide task-specific, context-aware control. \nQuery-level access control at a granular level. We analyze the shape of queries, such as whether they involve aggregation or random sampling. \nData-access budget. Employees are given a data-access budget based on the amount of data they typically access, and this budget, which refreshes daily, is our first line of defense. \nRule-based risk management. We employ rule-based risk control. This defends against attacks against or malfunctions of the AI agent.\nFigure 10: Partial data preview overview\nFigure 11, below, illustrates how the system architecture works: The data-user agent taps into the user-activities tool to gather user activities across various platforms, including diffs, tasks, posts, SEVs, dashboards, and documents. It also uses the user-profile tool to fetch profile information. With this data, the data-user agent formulates the user’s intention based on their activities, profiles, and query shapes, and then calls upon the data-owner agent. The data-owner agent steps in to analyze the query, identifying the resources being accessed. It then fetches metadata related to these resources, such as table summaries, column descriptions, data semantics, and SOPs. The data-owner agent leverages an LLM model to generate the output decision and the reasoning behind it. The output guardrail ensures that the decision aligns with rule-based risk calculations. \nFigure 11: Partial data preview architecture\nAll decisions and logs are securely stored for future reference and analysis. While many of these building blocks might be familiar to some of you—after all, we’ve been working with query analyzers for decades—this is the first time we’re harnessing the language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to build a multi-agent system for data users and data owners. LLMs have shown potential in this area because business needs are often context- and task-specific, making them difficult to model analytically. LLMs give us the ability to delve into these nuances, while the agents help us construct a dynamic, end-to-end workflow. At the same time, we employ guardrails, such as analytical rule-based risk computation, to ensure that the agents operate within set boundaries. Throughout the decision-making process, we also place a strong emphasis on transparency and tracing.\nBelow, Figure 12 shows the evaluation process. Evaluation is one of the most crucial steps in developing an agentic solution. To assess the system’s accuracy, recall, and other performance metrics, we curated an evaluation dataset using real requests. This involved compiling historical requests, collecting user activities and profile information, associating them with query runs, and then using this data for evaluation. We run the evaluation process daily to catch any potential regressions.\nFigure 12: Partial data preview evaluation\nWe’ve also developed a data flywheel for the process, as illustrated below in Figure 13. This means that data users’ queries, the agents’ processing traces, the context, and the final outputs are all securely stored for feedback and auditing purposes. Additionally, we’ve created a data tool for data owners, allowing them to view and review decisions and provide us with feedback. This feedback helps us update our evaluations and assess the overall process.\nFigure 13: Partial data preview feedback loop\nWhat’s ahead?\nThere’s still plenty of work ahead of us to become agent-ready. Here are just a few examples. \nFirst, agent collaboration. We’re seeing more and more scenarios where it’s not the users directly accessing data, but rather agents acting on their behalf. How can we support these use cases in the most efficient way?\nSecond, our data warehouse and tools were originally built for employees or services, not agents. How do we continue evolving them to be effectively used by other agents?\nLastly, evaluation and benchmarking are important, and we’ll need to keep developing these areas to ensure we stay on track.\nThe post Creating AI agent solutions for warehouse data access and security appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re exploring Meta’s Federation Platform, a scalable set of tools for managing compliance-related tasks, along with Privacy Waves, our method for batching these tasks and ensuring accountability. \nTogether, the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves create a structured, effective, and sustainable approach to operationalizing privacy work, enabling Meta to safeguard user data for the billions of people that use our products.\nGiven its success in the privacy domain, we’re expanding this approach to other domains such as security and accessibility.\nAt Meta, we take a systematic approach to privacy-related compliance. Experts decode complex obligations into actionable product requirements, ensuring coverage and consistency across all Meta products. We then deploy technical solutions that address these requirements at scale through our Privacy Aware Infrastructure (PAI) initiative. Following that, our privacy teams centrally automate remediation of potential issues; and finally, if expert help is needed, they send tasks to product teams for distributed execution.\nOperationalizing this work at Meta’s scale – across tens of thousands of engineers and numerous products – requires robust coordination. To facilitate this, we developed the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves program:\nThe Federation Platform breaks down large compliance-related initiatives into smaller, manageable workstreams. It distributes tasks to the appropriate teams and enables them to track progress through to completion.\nThe Privacy Waves program organizes tasks for these initiatives into monthly batches, creating a predictable cadence that improves quality and accountability of task distribution and management. It helps teams plan and execute their compliance-related work systematically, rather than reactively. \nTogether, the Federation Platform and Privacy Waves program play a critical role in safeguarding user data and ensuring consistent, effective operations of our systems and solutions, supporting Meta’s compliance posture (for both existing and future obligations) while balancing internal engineering efficiency and experience. \nThey are significant levers in Meta’s compliance-related efforts, managing over 100,000 tasks annually within established timelines. Internal surveys reveal significantly higher positive sentiment for Privacy Waves tasks compared to ad-hoc tasks. And we estimate that the program has saved hundreds of thousands of engineering hours by enhancing strategy, tooling, and task quality. The success of this approach in the privacy domain has encouraged its expansion into other domains such as security, accessibility and our broader compliance efforts.\nThe need for a centralized work distribution and management system\nThere are several reasons why large organizations like Meta benefit from a centralized system to distribute and manage compliance-related work:\nMeeting privacy obligations at scale is complex because it often requires thousands of engineers to each complete small, specialized tasks across hundreds of global pressures and thematic areas.\nScalability and internal accountability are crucial. Doing this ad hoc can lead to task fatigue, difficulty meeting completion expectations, and diminished developer sentiment. Without centralized management and oversight, it becomes challenging to effectively prioritize, track, and execute work across organizational boundaries, or to deduplicate tasks across teams.\nDeveloper experience matters and can even increase output. A positive, well-managed task flow reduces operational burden, maintains morale, and sustains high productivity. \nExternal accountability is essential to operations. Meta must demonstrate consistent and effective operations to regulators and auditors. The Federation Platform enables clear, standardized practices along with consistent documentation and validation to uphold Meta’s compliance posture in response to external requirements.\nManaging privacy work with the Federation Platform\nWorkstream configuration: How engineers integrate with the platform\n\nImplementing a workstream on the Federation Platform requires defining in-code logic that mirrors the typical lifecycle of a potential privacy issue. This involves specifying how to detect, distribute, remediate, and verify resolution of these issues, ensuring their effective management. The resulting technical workstream configuration (code file) includes methods for:\nScraping flags: Scraping involves identifying the relevant set of privacy flags –  indications of potential issues that require attention. These flags are ingested into the Federation Platform based on the workstream’s configuration, which often leverages Meta’s reusable detection and verification frameworks. The scraping process can be automated to run daily using in-code methods or ad-hoc via the platform’s intake APIs. Scraping defines the scope of the workstream, with additional filters and linters configured as needed.\nOwnership resolution: This involves implementing logic to determine the ownership of privacy flags. Typically, this requires referencing Meta’s central catalog to map relevant assets, such as code files and data tables, to their respective owners.\nGrouping: Workstreams can optionally group related flags, such as those with a common owner or located in the same directory. This allows for efficient bulk remediation by bundling these flags into a single task or diff (code change).\nActioning (Task/Diff): Workstreams decide how to address each privacy flag or group of flags. The most common approach is to file a task, which is then assigned to the asset owner. Alternatively, they can choose to send automated code changes to directly resolve issues, which must be reviewed by the asset owner.\nTask content and distribution: Workstreams configure the content of tasks, providing context on why the task is necessary, its alignment with privacy initiatives, and instructions and workflows to fix the issue. Workstreams also configure how they want to distribute their tasks, which is most commonly done through the Privacy Waves program.\nResolution logic: Finally, workstreams define resolution logic to determine when a privacy flag is resolved. This allows the Federation Platform to automatically close tasks once the underlying issue is fixed or reopen tasks if they are prematurely closed.\nThe general-purpose configuration described above is versatile and extends well beyond privacy use cases. For instance, security and accessibility workstreams have started utilizing it to address potential vulnerabilities and product accessibility matters through task distribution. Similarly, engineering excellence initiatives operate workstreams to drive API migrations, code quality improvements, and the cleanup of obsolete experiments across numerous teams. This positions the Federation Platform as a powerful tool for driving diverse, large scale initiatives across the organization.\nIn addition to the technical configuration steps outlined above, privacy workstreams strive to adhere to the comprehensive end-to-end federation process detailed below, ensuring a holistic approach to managing privacy issues.\nAn overview of the end-to-end federation process\nStep 1: High-level strategy and planning\nBefore distributing work, a thorough review process evaluates the holistic strategy for a privacy area to ensure their plan efficiently meets applicable privacy-related obligations. This strategy often involves a combination of developing privacy aware infrastructure and controls through traditional project work, privacy teams centralizing bulk remediation via scripts and mass code changes, and – when automated solutions are not feasible – distributing work across the company via Federation Platform workstreams and Privacy Waves.\nProduct organizations (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) receive advanced visibility into upcoming privacy work, allowing them to incorporate it into their roadmaps and commit to its delivery. While aligning work across organizational lines takes longer, it ultimately enables easier and more efficient completion of tasks.\nStep 2: Configuring efficient task experiences\nTasks for Federation Platform workstreams that participate in Privacy Waves must clearly communicate the nature of the work, due dates, link to relevant context and documentation, and contain the necessary steps for resolution. Structured tasks guide users through a wizard-like workflow with multiple-choice questions, often culminating in automated remediations (e.g., code changes, click-to-fix tools) based on user decisions. These ‘wizards’ facilitate appropriate decision-making by product engineers and, in some cases, have been shown to reduce the effort required to complete tasks by around 50%.\nTasks are enriched with links to support forums and similar tasks where assistance can be sought, if needed. AI-powered support agents are embedded within tasks which help task owners search through relevant resources and write code quickly, which requires human review before landing.\nStep 3: Reviewing and improving task quality\nA review committee provides feedback on task quality and content for workstreams participating in Privacy Waves, identifying areas for improvement and opportunities for automation. Automated health signals for each workstream, such as completion rates, open tasks, deferral rates, and developer friction (e.g., broken tooling, inadequate support), are measured and tracked. Workstreams and their reviewers monitor these metrics monthly and are held accountable for improvements.\nEngineering sentiment is captured for each workstream through task owner surveys, and AI is used to summarize their feedback, enabling workstream owners to learn from task owner input and enhance future tasks. These features contribute to improved work quality, developer sentiment, and completion rates.\nStep 4: Distributing the work\nLinting tools are employed to prevent the distribution of low-quality and low-risk work (e.g., for assets queued for deletion or lacking any data). Workstreams can configure the lints they wish to apply.\nTasks are sent in Privacy Waves, which are batches of privacy-related work distributed at a predefined, predictable cadence. Privacy Waves streamline execution, coordination, and reporting, since all tasks in a wave share the same deadline, allowing for timely reminders.\nA sophisticated matching algorithm aligns tasks with teams based on competing priorities related to assets they own. Combined with predictable task distribution, this approach ensures timely work assignment and enables teams to effectively prioritize, allowing them to balance responsibilities and make consistent progress towards addressing their workloads.\nStep 5: Ensuring accountability of execution\nTo ensure timely completion of tasks, deadlines are established with an aim at preventing deferral beyond these critical dates. Automated nudges and escalations are strategically used to remind individuals and teams to complete work on schedule, minimizing unnecessary noise and highlighting overdue tasks that require immediate attention.\nFurthermore, completion rates for privacy work are rigorously measured and reported at all organizational levels, fostering a culture of accountability from frontline teams to leadership. This transparent approach ensures that everyone is held responsible for executing their tasks in a timely manner, promoting a sense of ownership and urgency across the organization.\nStep 6: Reporting and recognition\nThe centralized distribution of tasks via Federation Platform and Privacy Waves streamline operational effectiveness and verification. These systems document completed tasks in a standardized format that aligns with expectations, providing clear and consistent evidence that supports Meta’s compliance posture in response to external requirements.\nAt Meta, executing on compliance-related work is an integral part of internal engineering expectations. To ensure that individuals receive the recognition they deserve, centralized recognition tooling is utilized to credit their contributions in performance evaluations. This approach not only motivates engineers to prioritize these efforts, but also reinforces the importance of this critical work in maintaining user trust and our compliance posture.\nExpansions for the Federation Platform and Waves\nAs Meta continues to evolve, the Federation Platform and Waves programs are actively being expanded into new domains like security, accessibility, and broader compliance-related efforts. This expansion presents unique challenges, including different types of tasks, complex multi-step remediation processes, varying deadlines, and more. However, our foundational principles of centralized task distribution, execution tracking, and accountability provide a robust framework to address these challenges effectively.\n\nTo ensure seamless extension into new areas, we’ll refine our tooling and processes, developing solutions that cater to each domain’s specific needs while maintaining high standards of quality and efficiency. By doing so, we aim to exceed expectations, reinforcing our commitment to safeguarding user data and ensuring efficient and consistent operations across all areas. This forward-looking approach underscores Meta’s dedication to innovation in compliance standardization, setting a benchmark for other tech companies to follow.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to express our gratitude to reviewers of this post, including (in last name alphabetical order): Chris Adams, Bob Baldwin, Denys Besedynskyy, Herb David, Dylan Drop, Katriel Cohn-Gordon, Xenia Habekoss, Mohit Jha, Ryan Pratt, Matt Pregozen, Jessica Retka, Thomas Richards, and Chris Wiltz, many of whom have made significant contributions to Federation Platform and Privacy Waves.\nAdditionally, we would also like to acknowledge the contributions of many current and former Meta employees, who have played a crucial role in developing and maturing Federation Platform and Privacy Waves over the years.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "TL;DR: Starting August 18, 2025, we’re rolling out a new AI quota model that makes AI subscriptions easier to understand and manage, while also letting you seamlessly extend your usage beyond your included quota with transparent pricing in real currency. The initial rollout will apply to individuals and organizations, with AI Enterprise updates to follow.\nWe are updating the quota system for JetBrains AI, as we recognize that the original system wasn’t crystal clear. In the rush to put powerful AI tooling in your hands, we made some numbers inaccessible. Over the past few months, we’ve been testing, listening to your feedback, and rethinking the cost structure, working to create a plan that’s easy to understand and built for the long haul.\nThe truth is, the AI market is shifting constantly. Prices change, models evolve, and every provider is still figuring out the best way forward. You told us you wanted more clarity regarding how much of your quota you have at any given time, what it’s worth, and how it’s being used. But you also just wanted more – the ability to continue using AI beyond the subscription limits. This update delivers exactly that – a transparent quota model tied directly to real currency that scales with your needs and lets you top up AI Credits to keep working without interruption.\nThe approach we’re introducing is designed to be fair to you and upfront about the cost of AI usage, without opaque calculations. That transparency helps us keep the JetBrains business model sustainable without external investment or subsidizing usage with VC money. We’re fully bootstrapped, and we plan to keep it that way.\nWhat’s changing\nSubscription tiers and prices will stay the same (minus original launch discount for AI Ultimate).\nEach subscription’s quota now matches its price. You’ll get AI Credits equal to the value of your plan, plus a small bonus with AI Ultimate. \nFor example, an individual AI Ultimate subscription costs USD 30.00 per month and now comes with USD 35.00 in AI Credits (USD 5 bonus credits). \nIn practice, this does mean that the quotas for some plans are getting smaller. If needed, you can purchase additional AI credits, allowing you to continue using the service even after reaching your quota.\n1 AI credit is equivalent to USD 1.00 (charged in your local currency).\nUsage is priced at public LLM rates (charged in USD), reflecting the mix of models you use across tools. You only pay for what you consume.\nTop up anytime. You can buy any amount of AI Credits to extend your usage. They last for 12 months.\nFor organizations, top-up AI Credits are shared across the team and may be reallocated to different users.\nJunie is now included in the AI Enterprise plan, along with a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) option.\nHow it works\nA monthly quota of AI Credits is included in your subscription, and you can purchase additional top-up credits at any time.\nCredits from your quota are used first.\nWhen they are gone, usage switches automatically to your top-up AI Credits (if you have any). You can top up your AI Credits in any amount via your JetBrains Account.\nTop-up AI Credits stay valid for 12 months.\nWhat this means for Junie and AI Assistant\nAI Assistant and Junie, our AI coding agent, continue to share the same credit system.\nThe AI Ultimate plan offers the best Junie experience, as it includes a larger quota, which is better for agentic workflows. If your quota runs out, you can easily top up.\nThe AI Pro plan works well if you are just getting started with Junie or use it only rarely, with the option to top up anytime.\nJunie is now included in the AI Enterprise plan, which includes a large quota suitable for regular use of the agent, advanced user management, AI audit logs, AI provider selection (through BYOK), and the option to run AI Enterprise on-premises.\nWhat’s next\nAugust 18 – The new quotas go live, with changes applying to your account at the start of your next 30-day quota refill cycle.\nLate September – We’ll implement real-time quota and usage tracking in JetBrains IDEs.\nSeptember and beyond – BYOK will be scaled to select subscription plans, meaning you’ll be able to use Junie either with all AI models included in the JetBrains AI subscription plans or with your own keys.\nThis is just the beginning. With transparent quotas now and detailed usage insights coming soon, you’ll be able to stay in control and never get surprised by your AI bill.",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/idea/2025/08/debugging-transactions-let-spring-debugger-do-the-heavy-lifting/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 13 Aug 2025 10:08:24 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Spring Framework’s declarative transaction management is incredibly powerful, allowing developers to simply add the @Transactional annotation to a method and let Spring handle the transaction details. However, misconfigurations or misunderstandings of how transactions work can lead to frustrating database transaction handling issues. Debugging these problems often means sifting through a lot of AOP proxy code, which is “not really a pleasant experience”.\nThis is where the Spring Debugger plugin comes to the rescue! It’s designed specifically to help you identify and fix these complex transaction management and JPA-related issues, making your debugging much smoother.\nYou can also watch the demonstration of Spring Debugger plugin’s database transaction debugging feature in this video.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnmasking Transactional Mysteries with Spring Debugger\nLet’s say we are building a bookmarks management application and consider a use case creating a new bookmark, which might also involve creating a new bookmark category if it doesn’t already exist. The goal is that if category creation succeeds but bookmark saving fails, only the bookmark changes should roll back, while the category creation should persist.\nA developer might implement this feature as follows:\n@Service\npublic class BookmarkService {\n   //....\n   @Transactional\n   public Bookmark createBookmark(CreateBookmarkCmd cmd) {\n       var bookmark = new Bookmark(cmd.title(), cmd.url());\n       if(cmd.categoryName() != null) {\n           Category category = categoryService.findByName(cmd.categoryName()).orElse(null);\n           if (category == null) {\n               category = this.createCategory(new Category(cmd.categoryName()));\n           }\n           bookmark.setCategory(category);\n       }\n       bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark);\n       log.info(\"Created bookmark with id: {}\", bookmark.getId());\n       return bookmark;\n   }\n\n   @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)\n   public Category createCategory(Category category) {\n       category.setId(null);\n       return categoryRepository.save(category);\n   }\n}\nThe current implementation assumes that the createBookmark() method annotated with @Transactional will start a transaction. Inside, if a category needs to be created, call createCategory() method which is annotated with @Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW), hoping it will start a new, independent transaction. The expectation is that if createBookmark() fails (e.g., due to a NULL URL), the category should still be saved.\nLet’s validate this logic through the following test.\nimport com.sivalabs.bookmarks.TestcontainersConfig;\nimport org.assertj.core.api.Assertions;\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\nimport org.springframework.context.annotation.Import;\nimport org.springframework.transaction.TransactionSystemException;\n\nimport java.util.Optional;\n\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;\nimport static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThatThrownBy;\n\n@SpringBootTest\n@Import(TestcontainersConfig.class)\nclass BookmarkServiceTest {\n   @Autowired\n   BookmarkService bookmarkService;\n   @Autowired\n   private CategoryRepository categoryRepository;\n\n   @Test\n   void shouldCreateCategoryEvenWhenBookmarkCreationFails() {\n       String categoryName = \"java25\";\n       Optional<Category> categoryOptional =\n               categoryRepository.findByNameEqualsIgnoreCase(categoryName);\n       assertThat(categoryOptional).isEmpty();\n\n       var cmd = new CreateBookmarkCmd(\n               \"My New Article\",\n               null,\n               categoryName);\n       assertThatThrownBy(()-> bookmarkService.createBookmark(cmd))\n               .isInstanceOf(TransactionSystemException.class);\n\n       categoryOptional = categoryRepository.findByNameEqualsIgnoreCase(categoryName);\n       assertThat(categoryOptional).isNotEmpty();\n   }\n}\nThe test will fail and the category was not saved, indicating that the intended separate transaction didn’t actually occur. Why?\nWithout Spring Debugger, figuring this out would involve painfully sifting through AOP proxy code. But with the plugin, it’s remarkably simple:\nSet breakpoints in your createBookmark() and createCategory() methods.\nRun your test in debug mode.\n\n\n\n\nAs you step through the code, the “Transaction” node in the debug tool window provides more insights.\nInitial Observation: When in the createBookmark() method, the debugger shows that the database transaction started there. Crucially, even after stepping into the createCategory() method, the debugger still indicates that the code is running in the same transaction that started in createBookmark().\nThe Revelation: This immediately highlights the problem! Even with @Transactional(propagation = REQUIRES_NEW) on createCategory(), it’s not starting a new transaction. The debugger helps us understand why: calling a method within the same class (a “local method call”) doesn’t go through the AOP proxy, meaning the @Transactional annotation on that internal method is not taken into consideration. This is why both bookmark and category creation were rolling back together when createBookmark() failed.\nThe Fix and Visual Validation\nThe solution is to move the createCategory() method into a separate service (e.g., CategoryService). When the createBookmark() method then calls categoryService.createCategory(), Spring’s AOP proxy can intercept this call.\nRunning the test in debug mode again with the Spring Debugger, you’ll see a profound difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen in createBookmark(), the debugger shows the parent transaction starting there.\nWhen you step into CategoryService.createCategory(), the debugger now clearly indicates that the current method is running in a new transaction that started in CategoryService.createCategory().\nEven better, the debug window shows the hierarchy of transactions, detailing the parent transaction (BookmarkService.createBookmark()) and the newly started child transaction (CategoryService.createCategory()).\nYou also get comprehensive information about each transaction, including its isolation level, propagation behavior, and read-only status.\nYou can also see the entities in the Hibernate’s L1 cache.\nWith this change, the code behaves as expected: if bookmark creation fails, only those changes are rolled back, and the category is successfully persisted in the database.\nBeyond Transactions: Visualizing JPA Entity States\nSpring Debugger isn’t just for transactions. It also provides crucial visibility into JPA entity states, which can be incredibly helpful for debugging persistence-related issues.\nAs you step through your code, the debugger can show you an entity’s current state:\nTRANSIENT: A newly created object that has not yet been persisted to the database.\nDETACHED: An entity that was once managed by the persistence context but is no longer associated with it (e.g., after returning from a service method).\nMANAGED: An entity that is currently being tracked by the persistence context.\nFor example, our bookmark entity starts in a TRANSIENT state. The category entity, after being created and then returning from CategoryService to BookmarkService, is shown as DETACHED.\n\n\n\n\nAfter calling bookmarkRepository.save(bookmark), the debugger shows bookmark entity state changing to MANAGED.\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization of entity state changes is really helpful for debugging these JPA related issues.\nConclusion\nThe Spring Debugger plugin is an indispensable tool for any Spring developer. It takes the guesswork out of debugging complex database transaction management issues by visualizing transaction flow, parent-child transaction hierarchies, and detailed transaction information. Moreover, its ability to show JPA entity state changes provides deep insights into how your data is being managed.\nIf you’ve ever struggled with Spring transaction or JPA-related bugs, go ahead, install the Spring Debugger plugin today! You can find more documentation on it within IntelliJ IDEA documentation as well. Happy debugging!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Integrate Qodana into TeamCity\n\n\n\nThere are many compelling reasons to use TeamCity as your CI server. Thanks to its out-of-the-box features, smart test management capabilities, and great scalability for enterprises, TeamCity offers a robust and reliable CI solution. But if you’re really looking to increase compliance and improve code quality and security, you can couple it with Qodana. \nIntegrating Qodana’s static code analysis can significantly improve the quality of your codebase and help you enforce better standards in your CI/CD pipeline. With built-in support through a dedicated Qodana build runner, it’s becoming increasingly easy to embed code quality checks directly into your development workflow.\nIn this post, we’ll explore how Qodana and TeamCity complement each other and how to get started with your integration process.\nTable of Contents\n\nBringing Qodana into TeamCity\nConfiguring Qodana in your build pipeline\nQuality gates and baseline comparisons\nCustom configuration with scripts\nViewing results in TeamCity or Qodana Cloud\nSupporting pull requests and branch analysis\nTeamCity Cloud and Qodana Cloud for better quality software products\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I use Qodana to analyze .NET projects?\nWhy is TeamCity often used with Qodana instead of other analyzers?\nWhere can I get assistance if I have an issue? \n\n\nBringing Qodana into TeamCity\nQodana is available as a build runner within TeamCity, making it simple to incorporate static analysis into your existing builds. To get started, make sure that your project is built using a language supported by Qodana, such as Java, Kotlin, PHP, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, or C#. \nQodana is compatible with various IDEs and any CI pipeline, including all JetBrains IDEs (like IntelliJ IDEA and Rider), VS Code, and Visual Studio, as well as platforms like Jenkins and .NET. You can find a list of Qodana linters here.\nIf you’re running your own TeamCity agents, ensure that Docker is installed and accessible. For users of TeamCity Cloud with JetBrains-hosted agents, this is already set up for you.\nIt’s worth noting that Qodana doesn’t currently support Windows-based build agents in TeamCity.\nConfiguring Qodana in your build pipeline\nSetting up Qodana in TeamCity is easy.\nWhile the recommended and most straightforward approach is to place your `qodana.yaml` configuration file directly in the repository, Qodana also supports dynamic configuration through TeamCity’s command-line runner. This can be helpful in edge cases, for example, if your team needs to tailor inspections dynamically based on project type, team preferences, or environment.\nThat said, for most teams, using a versioned `qodana.yaml` file ensures consistency, clarity, and traceability across builds.\nTo learn how to set up dynamic configuration in TeamCity, view our response to this query. \nPrefer something more visual? Explore Qodana’s code coverage reports in the TeamCity UI – no scripting required.\nStep 1: In TeamCity, go to the configuration page of your build and add a new build step. \nStep 2: Select the Qodana build runner, and then expand the advanced options to customize its behavior.\nStep 3: Define the linter you’d like to use, specify a version, and point to either a default or custom inspection profile. If you’re using Qodana Cloud, you can also add a project token at this stage. This is required for commercial linters, but optional for community ones.\nbuildType {\n    steps {\n        qodana {\n            name = \"Qodana analysis\"\n            linter = jvm {\n                version = Qodana.JVMVersion.LATEST\n            }\n            inspectionProfile = embedded {\n                name = \"qodana.starter\"\n            }\n            cloudToken = \"%qodana.cloud.token%\"\n            additionalQodanaArguments = \"--baseline qodana.sarif.json\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nOptional step: For more granular control, you can configure things like a unique report ID, working directory, or whether Qodana reports should be visible under the Tests tab in TeamCity. There’s also support for advanced parameters, such as Docker arguments or additional Qodana CLI options.\nFor more detailed instructions and more on the function of each step, view the docs. \nConfigure Qodana in TeamCity\n\n\n\n\nQuality gates and baseline comparisons\nQuality gates are tools that let you stop code from being merged to the main branch if it doesn’t meet specific requirements, or if too severe or too many issues are flagged. If a quality gate condition fails, Qodana terminates using exit code 255, which makes a CI/CD workflow or pipeline fail. \nQodana makes it easy to set up quality gates that fail a build when the number of issues exceeds a set threshold. It also supports baseline functionality, which allows you to compare the current analysis results with a previous state. This helps identify new problems instead of flagging the same issues with every analysis.\nBoth of these features are configured using simple command-line arguments in the Qodana runner. There are various ways you can set this up. For example, you can create a quality gate that considers the number of problems before allowing code to be merged (more flexible settings are available in `qodana.yaml`):\nfailureConditions:\n  severityThresholds:\n    any: 10 # Total problems\n    critical: 5 # Critical and other severities\n    high: 5\n    moderate: 10\n    low: 20\n    info: 20\n\n\n\n\nThis combination of quality gates and baseline functionality can help your team avoid a crisis as well as unnecessary noise from legacy issues.\nSet Up Quality Gates\nCustom configuration with scripts\nIf your project requires a custom inspection profile or specific exclusions, you can use a `qodana.yaml` file. You can either include this file in your repository or use a script in TeamCity to generate it on the fly.\n\n\n\n\nView Configuration Docs\nViewing results in TeamCity or Qodana Cloud\nOnce your build runs, Qodana offers flexible options for reviewing results. You can access detailed analysis directly in the Qodana tab within TeamCity, making it easy to spot issues alongside your other build diagnostics.\nAlternatively, you can explore the results in Qodana Cloud, which provides a web-based dashboard with collaboration tools, history tracking, and integration with issue trackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupporting pull requests and branch analysis\nQodana also works well in pull request workflows. The purpose of pull request analysis is to examine code changes in a pull request or merge request, detecting issues introduced or fixed by that specific change.\nQodana compares the current branch against the target branch (e.g. `main` or `develop`), and then it highlights issues only in the changed files or lines.\nBy configuring VCS triggers in TeamCity, you can analyze merge requests or specific branches before they’re integrated into your main codebase. This adds an essential layer of quality assurance to every code review.\nThen baseline track new problems introduced over time by comparing the current analysis results with a previous “clean” state.\nYou can generate a baseline file, and in future runs, Qodana compares the current issues against this baseline. Only new issues (not present in the baseline) are reported as problems.\nThese approaches can be combined for better quality gates and enforcement.\nTeamCity Cloud and Qodana Cloud for better quality software products\nIntegrating Qodana into your TeamCity pipeline gives you a solid foundation for a healthier codebase. With static analysis running automatically as part of your build process, you reduce the chance of bugs slipping through and can use Qodana to enforce quality as a team.\nTeamCity and Qodana compliment each other, with TeamCity managing your builds with Qodana ensuring that your code is clean and something you can be proud of. Both help prevent future issues, and together, they offer an automated, and scalable approach to CI/CD – with built-in code quality from day one.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHow do I use Qodana to analyze .NET projects?\nTo analyze .NET projects, you can use the `qodana-dotnet` Docker image or the native solution based on Rider. There’s also a Community Edition available via the `qodana-cdnet` Docker image, but it’s better to use the trial version of a paid license for greater functionality.\nWhy is TeamCity often used with Qodana instead of other analyzers?\nTeamCity and Qodana are both created by JetBrains, which means deep integration that’s not easily reproduced by competitors. \nWhere can I get assistance if I have an issue? \nYou can visit this TeamCity Support page or email Qodana Support.\nDon’t have TeamCity?

We support multiple LLM providers across our AI products to ensure you have access to the right tools for your needs and the freedom to choose the ones you prefer.\nToday, we’re excited to announce that the latest model from OpenAI, GPT-5, is now available in our AI products: AI Assistant, Junie, and Kineto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA leap forward in developer AI\nIn one of the most exciting recent developments in AI news, OpenAI has just revealed the new GPT-5 model. At JetBrains, we had the opportunity to access and test GPT-5 early. \n“Iterative deployment helps ensure we approach and launch new model capabilities with the highest levels of rigor. Working with JetBrains on GPT-5 is the latest example of how their feedback and early testing will help us identify the API’s optimal impact where it matters most for their users.”\nOlivier Godement, Head of Business Products at OpenAI\nBased on our testing, we consider GPT-5 a game changer for coding. It can handle larger, more complex development tasks with greater accuracy and reliability.\nJunie, the coding agent, now powered by GPT-5\nWith GPT-5 integrated, Junie becomes significantly more capable. In our internal benchmarks, GPT-5 delivered 1.5× to 2× improvements in code quality, task complexity handling, and overall performance compared to the previous OpenAI models. GPT-5 is set as the default model for Junie, but you can always change it in the plugin’s settings. \nIn this example, Junie was asked to create a hidden snake game as an Easter egg in a footer. \n\n\n\n\nIt not only identified the precise place to inject the feature in a large codebase, but it also accounted for dependencies and layout constraints – delivering production-ready code, fully integrated and bug-free.\nJetBrains AI Assistant gets a boost with GPT-5\nWith the latest update, JetBrains AI Assistant now has GPT-5 selected as the default model for chat, as it offers the best generation quality currently available, balanced with optimized costs.\nIn the example below, we give AI Assistant a single prompt asking it to create an HTML5 page showing what a JetBrains IDE could look like in 2030. This single prompt was enough for GPT-5 to generate a fully responsive, styled, and interactive prototype, demonstrating its exceptional capabilities when paired with JetBrains AI Assistant.\n\n\n\n\nHow to try GPT-5 in your IDE\nYou can try GPT-5 in your JetBrains IDE (starting from version 2025.2) by updating to the latest versions of the AI Assistant and Junie plugins (Settings | Plugins). GPT-5 will be available in AI Assistant’s chat and Junie as your default model.\nGet Started\n                                                    \nPowering creators with no-code solutions via Kineto and GPT-5 \nGPT-5 is particularly useful when it comes to frontend-related tasks. This is why we set this model as the default for Kineto, our brand-new no-code AI platform for generating websites and apps. GPT-5 gave Kineto a significant boost in creating single-purpose apps from user prompts with no coding required. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKineto is now in the Early Access Program. Join the waitlist to try it. \nHappy developing!",

        "content": "\n            \n            &lt;p&gt;회사에서 AI 도구를 자유롭게 활용할 수 있도록 지원해 준 덕분에, 그동안 Cursor, Cline, Copilot 등 다양한 코딩 에이전트를 활용해 개발 생산성을 높일 수 있었습니다. 그러던 중 지난 2025년 6월 24일 Anthropic에서 터미널 기반의 코딩 에이전트인 Claude Code를 정식 출시했습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;터미널은 개발자가 컴퓨터와 직접 대화를 나눌 수 있는 창구라서 떼려야 뗄 수 없지만, GUI의 도움을 받아 개발 하다보면 터미널에 익숙하지 않을 수 있습니다. GUI가 편하기도 하고요. 그래서 별도 GUI 인터페이스를 갖추고 있는 Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 사용해 오던 입장에서, 처음에 Claude Code 컨셉만 들었을땐 마냥 불편할 것만 같았습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그런데 막상 써보니 인터페이스가 터미널이라 굉장히 가벼울 뿐 아니라, 특정 IDE에 종속되지 않고 어디서든 쓸 수 있다는 점이 장점으로 느껴졌습니다. 특히 JVM 환경에서 주로 개발하다 보니, 프로젝트 인덱싱, 컴파일, 빌드 등의 과정이 Cursor나 Cline에서는 다소 불편하게 느껴졌는데, Claude Code는 IntelliJ의 터미널에서 실행되니 마치 플러그인 하나 설치해 쓰는 듯한 경험이었습니다. 그래서 Cursor를 주로 사용하던 저는 이제 Claude Code만 쓰는 사람이 되었습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코딩 에이전트를 포함한 AI 기술은 하루가 다르게 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 일주일, 한 달만 지나도 새로운 기술과 모델이 나오고, 이전 것은 금세 시야에서 사라집니다. 개발자는 그때마다 새로운 경험을 맞이하게 됩니다. Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 쓰면서 이 다음에 뭐가 나올까 궁금했는데 Claude Code가 하나의 변곡점이 될 거라는 느낌을 받았습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;혼자서 스터디도 하고 사내 엔지니어들과 이야기를 나누면서 Claude Code를 더 잘 써보기 위한 방법들을 하나 둘 찾아나갔고, 지난 달 전사 테크 올핸즈에서 ‘&lt;strong&gt;한 번 쓰고 끝이 아니다. 끊임없이 진화하는 코딩 에이전트 활용법&lt;/strong&gt;’ 이라는 주제로 Claude Code 사용 방법에 대해 공유했습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;결국 코딩 에이전트를 사용하는 목적 중 하나는 생산성을 극대화 시키기 위함인데, 코딩 에이전트에게 무언가 시키고 나면 다시 제가 직접 수정하는 일이 생겼고 이건 목적에서 조금은 벗어난다는 생각이 들었습니다. ‘이럴 거면 내가 짜는 게 낫지‘ 라는 결론으로 이어질 수도 있고요. 그래서 Claude Code를 더 잘 활용하기 위해 Rules, Custom commands, Hooks 등을 작성했고, 머지 않아 또 다른 패러다임에 변화가 올거라 믿지만, 개인 블로그에도 간단하게 기록차 남겨봅니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h1 id=&quot;claude-code-101&quot;&gt;Claude Code 101&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-1&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-1&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;다들 첫 출근날과 처음으로 업무 받은 날을 기억하나요? 만약 어떤 회사에 입사를 했는데 팀에 나 혼자라고 가정해봅시다. 업무를 받았으니 무언가 해야 되는데 참고할 만한 문서가 있긴 한데 많이 부실합니다. 그리고 작성된 코드 양은 너무 많아서 어디 부터 봐야 할 지 모르는 상황입니다. 이럴때 우리는 어떻게 해야할까요?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-2&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-2&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;‘어떤 것부터 알면 될까?’ 생각이 들텐데, 실제로는 내가 뭘 알아야 하는지도 모르는 상태입니다. 아는게 있어야 뭘 모르는지도 알게 될테니까요. 그렇다면 이 상황을 어떻게 해결하면 좋을까요? 간단한 방법은 2가지가 있습니다. 누군가에게 일단 물어보거나, 스스로 알아갈 때까지 고뇌하는 것입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-3&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-3&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이런 상황을 해결하기 위해 회사는 ‘신규 입사자 온보딩’ 프로그램을 운영하곤 합니다. 신규 입사자가 왔을때 여기는 어떤 문화를 가지고 있고, 시스템은 어떻고, 나는 어떤 일을 어떻게 하면 되는지 방법을 알려줍니다. 새로 온 동료가 그동안의 오래된 제품에 대한 맥락과 팀의 일하는 방식을 알아가기 까지 스스로 한다면 더 오랜 시간이 걸릴텐데, 잘 정리되어 있는 문서나 참고해야 할 요소들이 많다면 더 빠르게 알아갈 수 있을거에요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코딩 에이전트도 이와 크게 다르지 않습니다. 무작정 코딩 에이전트에게 ‘1000원 할인 코드 작성해줘’ 라고 하면 코딩 에이전트는 구체적인 정보를 찾기 위해 더 많은 시간을 쓰고 알지 못한다면 추측을 하기도 합니다. 그래서 코딩 에이전트가 나와 수년을 함께 한 동료가 되기 위해서는 알고 있는 모든 것을 알려줘야 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-4.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-4&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-4&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;우리 팀의 프로젝트 아키텍처는 어떤 형태로 구성되어 있는지 자세히 알려줘야 합니다. 의존성 규칙과 방향이 강제되어 있다면 이 또한 반드시 알려줘야 합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코드 컨벤션이 있다면 이 또한 자세히 가이드 해줘야 합니다. 팀에서 사용중인 코드 컨벤션이 없다면 각 언어의 공식 컨벤션이라도 알려주면 좋습니다. 저희 팀은 클래스 네이밍에 Alistair Cockburn이 언급한 원칙인 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;the name should be the goal as a short active verb phrase&lt;/code&gt; 을 준수합니다. 이름만 보고도 그 클래스의 역할과 책임이 명확히 드러나야 하고, 역할과 책임 그리고 의미있는 접미사/접두사를 사용합니다. 그래서 대부분의 클래스는 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;동사 + 역할 + 접미사&lt;/code&gt; 의 조합으로 이름을 짓고 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-5.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-5&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-5&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;팀에서 사용중인 테스트 작성법이 있다면 이것도 자세히 알려줍니다. 저희 팀은 외부 의존성이 필요한 Mocking Library 사용을 지양하고, 조금 더 Production Code 변화에 유연하게 대응하기 위해 Test Double을 직접 만들어서 사용합니다. 그리고 테스트 코드를 구조화해서 가독성, 유지보수성, 일관성을 끌어 올리기 위해 AAA(Arrange, Act, Assert) 패턴을 사용합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-6.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-6&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-6&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;커밋을 작성할 때에도 기본 형식이 있습니다. 커밋 메시지의 맨 앞에는 이슈 티켓을 입력하고, 그 다음에는 어떤 유형의 커밋이고 어떤 모듈의 변화인지, 그리고 마지막에는 커밋의 설명을 간단하게 작성합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;GZ-{티켓번호} {타입}({모듈}): {설명}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-7.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-7&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-7&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Claude Code는 우리 팀이 이렇게 일한다는 사실을 알고 있을까요? 알 수 없으면 알려주면 됩니다. 팀의 일하는 방식을 알려주면 그 순간 수년을 함께 한 동료가 될 수 있습니다. 애자일하게 일하는 조직일수록 일하는 방식은 날이 갈수록 개선됩니다. 저희 팀도 마찬가지로 일하는 방식과 가이드가 그 때의 상황에 따라 더 나은 방향으로 계속해서 개선되고 있습니다. 과거에는 맞았지만 지금은 다를 수 있으니까요. 미래에는 더 다를거고요.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마찬가지로, 다양한 코드 작성 Rule을 통해 Claude Code는 어떻게 코드를 작성하면 되는지 알게 될텐데, 이 Rule은 계속해서 개선되고 진화해야 합니다. 개발 팀미팅에서 클래스 네이밍하는 방식이 변경됐다면 Rule에도 업데이트 하고 Claude Code에게도 이 사실을 알려줘야 합니다. 그래서 우스갯소리로 가이드 문서(Rule)가 얼마나 자주 업데이트 되는지 보면, 코딩 에이전트를 얼마나 잘 활용하고 있는지 알 수 있습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-8.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-8&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-8&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;그래서 Claude Code 뿐만 아니라 코딩 에이전트에게 무언가 프롬프팅을 완료하고 나면 끝이 아니라 이제부터가 시작입니다. 코드를 원하는대로 잘 작성했다면 다음번에도 이처럼 잘 할 수 있도록 가이드 해줘야 합니다. 코딩 에이전트에게 준 피드백과 쌓여가는 Rule은 곧, 복리의 마법으로 다가올 것이라는걸 믿는게 중요하다고 생각합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-9.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-9&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-9&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;발표 자료 중간에 Claude Code 기본 사용법과 소소한 팁이 있는데, 이 글에 담기엔 단순 정보라서 PDF를 참고해주시면 좋겠습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;아무튼.. 가장 중요한 것은 꺾이지 않는 마음입니다. 코딩 에이전트에게 무언가 명령을 했는데 잘 알아듣지 못하고 엉뚱한 코드를 작성한다거나 내가 작성하는 스타일과 다르게 코드를 작성한다거나, 마음에 들지 않을때 있습니다. 이 때 우리는 ‘그냥 내가 하는게 낫겠다’ 라는 생각이 들면서 갈림길에 놓이게 됩니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;이 때 한 숨 크게 고르시고, 어떤게 잘못되었는지 어떻게 작성해야 하는지 알려주어야 합니다. 이건 마치 일을 빠르게 처리하지 못하고 있는 신규 입사자 동료에게 답답함을 느끼는 것과 같다고 생각합니다. 수정이 필요한 부분이 있다면 직접 고치지 않고, 어떤 코드를 어떻게 작성하면 되는지 알려주어야 합니다. 잘 해냈다면 다음 번에는 어떻게 하면 되는지 피드백을 통해 가이드와 Rule을 갱신합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-10.png&quot; alt=&quot;claude-code-101-10&quot; title=&quot;claude-code-101-10&quot; class=&quot;center-image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마지막으로, 이 발표에서 전달하려고 했던 메시지 메시지입니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;코딩 에이전트가 못하면 가르치자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;코딩 에이전트가 해냈으면 회고하자&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;그리고 복리의 마법을 믿자&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr /&gt;\n\n&lt;h3 id=&quot;마치며&quot;&gt;마치며&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;코딩 에이전트를 접하고 나서 정말 많은 시간을 코드 작성법(Rule)을 만드는 일에 할애했습니다. 팀에서 수십개 서비스를 모노레포에 관리중인데, 오래전부터 아키틱체와 코드 컨벤션을 잘 유지하고 가이드를 다듬어 놓아서 초기 Rule을 작성하는데에 시간은 오래 걸렸지만 어렵지 않았습니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;지금은 Claude Code를 사용하면서 N개의 일을 병렬로 할 수 있는 환경이 되었습니다. 커밋 메시지를 작성한다던가, Pull Request 본문을 작성하는 등 코드를 작성하고 나서 반복적으로 하는 작업들은 더이상 제가 하지 않습니다. Claude Code가 일을 잘 해서 그런것도 있지만, 초기에 Rule 셋팅하는 시간을 많이 투자한 덕분이라고 생각합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;단순한 기능을 만들 때에는 가이드 없이 Claude Code를 바로 사용해도 좋다고 생각합니다. 하지만 조금 복잡해지거나 도메인 규칙을 이해해야 한다거나, 우리 팀만의 가이드에 따라 코드 작성이 필요하다면 바로 사용하는건 멈추고 Rule 부터 정돈하기를 권장합니다.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;마지막으로, 작성된 모든 내용은 제 개인적인 의견이고 소수의 인원이 작업을 하는 곳보다 다수의 인원이 같은 Repository에 작업을 할 때에는 더 빛을 보는 방법이니 참고해주세요. 모두 복리의 마법을 믿고 코딩 대탈출 하셨으면 좋겠습니다!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;P.S. 발표 자료는 일부 내용 제거된 형태로 업로드 되어 있습니다. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sungjk/sungjk.github.io/tree/master/images/2025/08/09/ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf&quot;&gt;ClaudeCode101_20250809.pdf&lt;/a&gt;를 참고하시면 됩니다. 궁금하신 점이 있으면 편하게 메일로 연락 주세요.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n            \n          ",
        "contentSnippet": "<p>회사에서 AI 도구를 자유롭게 활용할 수 있도록 지원해 준 덕분에, 그동안 Cursor, Cline, Copilot 등 다양한 코딩 에이전트를 활용해 개발 생산성을 높일 수 있었습니다. 그러던 중 지난 2025년 6월 24일 Anthropic에서 터미널 기반의 코딩 에이전트인 Claude Code를 정식 출시했습니다.</p>\n\n<p>터미널은 개발자가 컴퓨터와 직접 대화를 나눌 수 있는 창구라서 떼려야 뗄 수 없지만, GUI의 도움을 받아 개발 하다보면 터미널에 익숙하지 않을 수 있습니다. GUI가 편하기도 하고요. 그래서 별도 GUI 인터페이스를 갖추고 있는 Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 사용해 오던 입장에서, 처음에 Claude Code 컨셉만 들었을땐 마냥 불편할 것만 같았습니다.</p>\n\n<p>그런데 막상 써보니 인터페이스가 터미널이라 굉장히 가벼울 뿐 아니라, 특정 IDE에 종속되지 않고 어디서든 쓸 수 있다는 점이 장점으로 느껴졌습니다. 특히 JVM 환경에서 주로 개발하다 보니, 프로젝트 인덱싱, 컴파일, 빌드 등의 과정이 Cursor나 Cline에서는 다소 불편하게 느껴졌는데, Claude Code는 IntelliJ의 터미널에서 실행되니 마치 플러그인 하나 설치해 쓰는 듯한 경험이었습니다. 그래서 Cursor를 주로 사용하던 저는 이제 Claude Code만 쓰는 사람이 되었습니다.</p>\n\n<p>코딩 에이전트를 포함한 AI 기술은 하루가 다르게 빠르게 발전하고 있습니다. 일주일, 한 달만 지나도 새로운 기술과 모델이 나오고, 이전 것은 금세 시야에서 사라집니다. 개발자는 그때마다 새로운 경험을 맞이하게 됩니다. Cursor, Cline 같은 도구를 쓰면서 이 다음에 뭐가 나올까 궁금했는데 Claude Code가 하나의 변곡점이 될 거라는 느낌을 받았습니다.</p>\n\n<p>혼자서 스터디도 하고 사내 엔지니어들과 이야기를 나누면서 Claude Code를 더 잘 써보기 위한 방법들을 하나 둘 찾아나갔고, 지난 달 전사 테크 올핸즈에서 ‘<strong>한 번 쓰고 끝이 아니다. 끊임없이 진화하는 코딩 에이전트 활용법</strong>’ 이라는 주제로 Claude Code 사용 방법에 대해 공유했습니다.</p>\n\n<p>결국 코딩 에이전트를 사용하는 목적 중 하나는 생산성을 극대화 시키기 위함인데, 코딩 에이전트에게 무언가 시키고 나면 다시 제가 직접 수정하는 일이 생겼고 이건 목적에서 조금은 벗어난다는 생각이 들었습니다. ‘이럴 거면 내가 짜는 게 낫지‘ 라는 결론으로 이어질 수도 있고요. 그래서 Claude Code를 더 잘 활용하기 위해 Rules, Custom commands, Hooks 등을 작성했고, 머지 않아 또 다른 패러다임에 변화가 올거라 믿지만, 개인 블로그에도 간단하게 기록차 남겨봅니다.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h1 id=\"claude-code-101\">Claude Code 101</h1>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/2025/08/09/claude-code-101-1.png\" alt=\"claude-code-101-1\" title=\"claude-code-101-1\" class=\"center-image\" /></p>\n\n<p>다들 첫 출근날과 처음으로 업무 받은 날을 기억하나요?

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>GPT-5 vs GPT-4, 프롬프트의 본질과 변화  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">결론부터 말하면, GPT-5는 기존 프롬프트의 기본 원칙은 그대로 유지하고 있어요. 즉, 명확하고 구체적인 지시, 충분한 맥락 제공, 그리고 제약조건 명시는 여전히 유효한 베스트 프랙티스입니다. 단계적 사고를 유도하는 문구나 출력 형식을 명확하게 지정하는 것도 여전히 효과적이고요. 하지만 GPT-5는 내부적인 구조와 기능이 달라지면서 프롬프트 작성에 있어 몇 가지 중요한 차이점이 생겼습니다. 특히, GPT-5는 단일 모델처럼 보이지만 내부적으로 작업 특성에 맞춰 하위 모드/서브모델로 자동 라우팅되는 '통합 라우팅' 기능을 전제로 작동합니다. 이는 프롬프트에서 문제의 난이도, 정확성 요구사항, 검증 단계를 분명히 언급하면 모델이 더 적합한 추론 모드로 전환되어 품질이 좋아지는 것을 의미합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">또한, GPT-5는 복잡한 과제에서 자동으로 더 많은 계산을 쓰는 '딥 리즈닝(Thinking)' 모드가 동작하도록 설계되어, 고난도 문제에서 오류가 줄었다는 보고가 있습니다. 모호하거나 위험한 요청에 전면 거부 대신 안전 범위 내에서 유용한 답을 주려는 '세이프 컴플리션' 경향도 강화되었습니다. 이 때문에, 프롬프트에서 '허용 범위'와 '금지 범위', 그리고 원하는 추상화 레벨을 명확히 지정하는 것이 중요해졌습니다. 이제는 장황한 스타일 지시 대신에 '말수/Verbosity' 같은 새로운 API 매개변수를 활용하거나, '프리셋 퍼스낼리티'를 통해 대상 독자와 톤을 짧게 지정하는 것만으로도 원하는 결과물을 얻을 수 있게 되었습니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 18px;

        "contentSnippet": "GPT-5 출시 후 겪었던 문제점들과 사라졌던 GPT-4o가 다시 돌아온 이유, 그리고 두 모델을 모두 활용하는 방법까지! 이 글 하나로 GPT-5와 4o를 둘러싼 모든 궁금증을 해결해 드립니다.\n\n\n \n 지난주 OpenAI가 야심차게 GPT-5를 출시했을 때, 많은 이들이 AI의 새로운 시대를 기대했습니다. 하지만 기대와 달리 \"대화 경험이 퇴보했다\"는 사용자들의 불만이 터져 나왔고, 결국 OpenAI는 단종했던 GPT-4o를 다시 서비스하는 이례적인 결정을 내렸습니다. 대체 GPT-5에 무슨 문제가 있었고, 우리는 왜 그토록 GPT-4o를 그리워했던 걸까요? 그 흥미로운 뒷이야기와 함께, 두 모델을 200% 활용하는 방법을 자세히 알려드릴게요! \n \n1. GPT-5의 초기 문제점들  \nGPT-5는 분명 기술적으로 뛰어난 모델이지만, 출시 초기 여러 문제점을 드러내며 사용자들의 기대를 충족시키지 못했습니다. 가장 큰 문제는 새로 도입된 '자동 모델 라우팅 시스템'의 불안정성이었습니다. 이 시스템은 사용자 질문에 맞춰 최적의 서브 모델을 자동으로 선택하도록 설계되었지만, 초기 오류로 인해 오히려 응답 품질이 저하되는 현상이 발생했습니다.\n이로 인해 사용자들은 다음과 같은 불편을 겪었습니다:\n일관성 없는 답변: GPT-5의 답변이 짧고 일관성이 떨어진다는 평가가 많았습니다.\n직관성 및 감성 부족: 일부 요청에서 GPT-4o보다 덜 직관적이고 정서적 반응이 약하다는 피드백이 나왔습니다.\n성능 논란: 느린 응답 속도와 불안정한 답변 품질에 대한 불만이 커뮤니티를 통해 확산되었습니다.\n⚠️ \"친구가 사라졌다\"\n가장 큰 반발은 기존에 잘 사용하던 GPT-4o 모델 선택권을 강제로 없앤 것이었습니다. OpenAI는 GPT-5로의 강제 전환을 시도했지만, 이는 기존 워크플로에 익숙했던 사용자들의 큰 혼란과 불만을 야기했습니다.\n \n2. 논란에도 GPT-5를 출시한 전략적 이유  \n그렇다면 OpenAI는 왜 이런 문제들을 안고서 GPT-5를 서둘러 출시했을까요? 이는 단순한 실수가 아닌, 치밀한 전략적 판단일 가능성이 높습니다.\n시장 주도권 선점: 경쟁사보다 한발 앞서 차세대 모델을 공개함으로써 기술 리더십을 공고히 하고 시장의 관심을 집중시키려는 의도입니다.\n실사용 데이터 확보: 실제 환경에서의 조기 배포를 통해 다양한 버그와 성능 문제를 빠르게 파악하고 개선하기 위한 목적입니다.\n구독자 및 투자자 유지: 지속적으로 새로운 모델을 제공함으로써 유료 구독자의 만족도를 높이고 투자자들에게 성장 가능성을 보여주려는 전략입니다.\n물론 이 전략에는 브랜드 신뢰도 하락과 같은 리스크가 따랐지만, OpenAI는 GPT-4o를 복귀시키는 유연한 대응으로 리스크를 관리하며 장기적인 목표를 추진하고 있습니다.\n \n3. 왜 우리는 GPT-4o를 그리워했을까?  \nGPT-4o가 사용자들에게 특별했던 이유는 단순히 성능이 좋아서가 아니었습니다. GPT-4o는 많은 사람들에게 '친근하고 따뜻한 대화 상대'로 인식되었습니다. 부드러운 어조와 높은 공감 능력은 사용자들이 AI와 정서적인 유대감을 형성하게 만들었죠.\n커뮤니티에서는 GPT-4o를 \"친구\"나 \"대화 파트너\"처럼 느꼈다는 경험담이 쏟아졌습니다. 창작 활동, 고민 상담, 언어 학습 등 감성적인 교감이 중요한 영역에서 GPT-4o는 대체 불가능한 존재감을 보였습니다. 기술적으로 더 뛰어난 GPT-5가 오히려 \"차갑다\"는 평가를 받은 것은, 사용자들이 AI에서 기술적 완벽함뿐만 아니라 인간적인 상호작용을 얼마나 중요하게 생각하는지를 보여줍니다.\n \n4. GPT-4o vs GPT-5 전격 비교  \n이제 우리는 두 가지 강력한 모델을 모두 사용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 그렇다면 어떤 상황에서 어떤 모델을 쓰는 것이 가장 효율적일까요? 두 모델의 특징을 한눈에 비교해 보세요.\n구분\nGPT-4o (실시간 소통 전문가)\nGPT-5 (고도의 추론 전문가)\n\n\n\n\n핵심 특징\n실시간·저지연 멀티모달(음성, 이미지 등) 상호작용에 최적화\n복잡한 추론, 코딩, 수학 문제 해결 능력 및 정확도 대폭 향상\n\n\n주요 강점\n사람과 대화하는 듯한 빠른 음성 응답(평균 320ms), 비용 효율성\n'Thinking' 모드를 통한 깊이 있는 사고, 멀티툴(검색, 코드 실행 등) 결합 능력 강화\n\n\n추천 사용 사례\n실시간 음성 대화, 라이브 데모, 빠른 아이디어 구상, 감성적인 글쓰기\n복잡한 연구/데이터 분석, 전문 코딩, 장문 문서 요약, 논리/수학 문제 풀이\n\n\n안전성\n기존 모델 대비 아첨 경향 등 조정 진행\n불필요한 거부는 줄이면서 환각(오류) 비율을 낮추도록 개선됨\n\n\n\n \n5. 돌아온 GPT-4o! 다시 사용하는 방법  ️\n사용자들의 강력한 요청에 힘입어 돌아온 GPT-4o! ChatGPT Plus 이상 구독자라면 몇 가지 간단한 설정만으로 그리웠던 GPT-4o의 감성을 다시 느낄 수 있습니다.\n  알아두세요!\n이 기능은 월 $20의 유료 구독 서비스인 ChatGPT Plus 사용자 이상에게만 제공됩니다.\nChatGPT 웹사이트에 로그인 후, 좌측 하단 프로필을 클릭하여 설정에 진입합니다.\n일반 탭에서 레거시 모델 보기 토글을 켭니다.\n이제 대화창 상단 모델 선택 드롭다운 메뉴에서 GPT-4o를 선택할 수 있습니다.\n모바일 앱의 경우, 위 설정 후 앱을 완전히 재시작해야 변경사항이 적용됩니다.\n\n\n\n\n6. 이번 사건의 시사점  \nGPT-4o의 복귀 사건은 AI 기술 개발의 미래에 중요한 교훈을 남겼습니다. 단순히 더 똑똑하고 강력한 모델을 만드는 것만이 정답이 아니라는 사실을 명확히 보여주었죠. 기술적 진보만큼이나 사용자가 AI와 어떻게 상호작용하고 어떤 경험을 하는지가 장기적인 성공의 핵심 열쇠가 될 것입니다.\nOpenAI는 이번 결정을 통해 사용자들의 목소리에 귀 기울이는 유연한 태도를 보여주었고, 이는 장기적으로 브랜드 신뢰도를 회복하는 데 긍정적인 영향을 미칠 것입니다.\n \n \n7. 핵심 요약 카드\n✨ 문제의 시작: GPT-5의 초기 성능 불안과 '차가운' 대화 스타일에 사용자 불만 폭주\n❤️ 4o를 그리워한 이유: 단순 AI가 아닌 '친구 같은' 감성적 교감과 부드러운 대화 능력 때문\n ️ 해결책: OpenAI, 사용자 피드백 수용!

        "contentSnippet": "\"조회수 100의 벽, 어떻게 뚫을까?\" AI를 활용한 쇼츠 영상 자동화 시스템으로 콘텐츠 제작 고민을 해결하고, 바이럴 영상을 만드는 노하우를 공개합니다.\n\n\n \n 혹시 유튜브 채널을 시작하고 나서 매일 '오늘은 또 어떤 콘텐츠를 만들어야 하나...' 머리를 쥐어뜯은 경험 있으신가요? 조회수는 정체되어 있고, 아이디어는 고갈되고, '나는 재능이 없나?' 하는 자괴감마저 들 때도 많으실 거예요. 저도 똑같은 고민을 했었고, 정말 막막한 시간을 보냈습니다.\n하지만 만약 이런 고민을 한 방에 해결해 줄 수 있는 시스템이 있다면 어떨까요? 버튼 몇 번만 누르면 사람들이 열광하는 바이럴 콘텐츠 아이디어, 대본, 심지어 이미지까지 자동으로 만들어주는 '콘텐츠 공장'이 내 컴퓨터 안에 생긴다면요! 오늘은 그 상상을 현실로 만드는 모든 과정을 여러분께 보여드리려고 합니다.\n \n바이럴 콘텐츠의 핵심, 제미나이 젬 지침  \n모든 것의 시작은 '어떻게 하면 시청자를 끝까지 붙잡아 둘 수 있을까?'라는 질문에서 시작됐어요. 수많은 바이럴 영상을 분석한 결과, 저는 두 개의 강력한 제미나이 젬 지침을 만들 수 있었습니다. 이 두 개의 젬 지침을 사용하면 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작, 편집까지 완전 자동화된 시스템을 갖게 될 거예요.\n첫 번째는 '썰' 전문가 지침이에요. 유명 유튜브 썰 채널들을 분석해보니, 사람들은 달달한 연애, 짜릿한 복수, 짠한 이별, 소름 돋는 반전 등 12가지 감정의 굴레에서 벗어나지 않더라고요. 이 12개 카테고리를 AI에게 학습시켜서 어떤 주제든 감정선을 관통하는 이야기를 만들도록 한 것이죠.\n두 번째는 '바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기' 지침이에요. 이 지침은 광고 공식을 스토리텔링에 완벽하게 녹여낸 PAS(문제 제기, 불안감 증폭, 해결책 제시) 구조를 따릅니다. 마치 '친구가 흥분해서 털어놓는 썰'처럼 느껴지게 만들어서 광고가 아닌 흥미로운 이야기로 받아들이게 하는 것이 핵심입니다.\n\n2025.08.10 - [AI, 미래기술/AI 챗봇 및 지침 무료 배포] - 쇼핑 썰, 일상 썰도 문제없어! AI가 만드는 유튜브 쇼츠 대본 GEM 지침 무료 다운로드\n5단계 스토리텔링 구조: 바이럴 썰 대본의 비밀  ️‍♀️\n썰 전문가 지침의 진짜 핵심은 검증된 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 강제하는 데 있습니다. 이 구조만 잘 따라가면 어떤 이야기든 시청자를 사로잡을 수 있어요.\n훅킹 (Hooking)  : 3초 안에 시청자의 멱살을 잡는 단계입니다. '이게 뭐지?' 하는 궁금증을 유발해서 스크롤을 멈추게 만들죠.\n갈등 고조 (Rising Action)  ️: 주인공이 겪는 문제를 구체적으로 보여주면서 시청자를 이야기에 서서히 몰입시킵니다.\n절정 (Climax)  : 모든 갈등과 감정이 폭발하는 지점이에요. 여기서 극적인 반전이 터져 나오면서 시청자의 감정을 최고조로 끌어올립니다.\n결말 (Resolution)  : 모든 것이 해결되며 감동이나 교훈, 혹은 깊은 여운을 남깁니다.\n행동 유도 (Call to Action)  ️: \"여러분 생각은 어떠세요?\"와 같은 질문을 던져 댓글을 유도하고, 영상의 참여도를 높이는 단계입니다.\n이 구조에 맞춰서 대본과 각 장면에 맞는 이미지 프롬프트까지 한 번에 생성해주는 것이 바로 첫 번째 지침서의 역할입니다.\n \nAI 스튜디오 '앱 빌더'를 활용한 자동화의 완성  \n강력한 젬 지침이 있어도 문제가 있었어요. 일반 챗봇은 장기 기억이 없어서 대화가 길어지면 핵심 규칙을 까먹고 원치 않는 결과물이 나오기도 했죠. 게다가 이미지 생성도 일곱 장면짜리 대본을 만들려면 일곱 번이나 수동으로 요청해야 하는 비효율적인 작업이었습니다.\n이 모든 문제를 해결해 줄 히든카드가 바로 구글 AI 스튜디오의 '앱 빌더'입니다! 젬 지침을 앱으로 만들면 매번 완벽하게 초기화된 상태에서 지침을 수행하기 때문에 결과물의 품질이 항상 일정해요. 그리고 가장 중요한 점은 이미지 생성도 일괄 처리가 가능하다는 것입니다.\n  알아두세요!\nAI 이미지 생성 API를 활용하면 AI 스튜디오의 하루 사용 제한을 우회할 수 있어요. 유료지만 비용만 지불하면 오픈AI의 '달리 쓰리'나 'GPT 이미지 원' 같은 모델을 원하는 만큼 사용할 수 있습니다. API는 마치 여러분 대신 원하는 정보를 가져다주는 '심부름꾼'이라고 생각하면 쉬워요.\n이 앱을 사용하면 카테고리 선택, 주제 생성, 이미지 스타일, 비율, 장면 수만 설정하고 '대본 생성하기' 버튼만 클릭하면 끝! 장면별 나레이션과 이미지 프롬프트가 모두 정리되어 출력되고, 이미지도 한 번에 생성하거나 개별적으로 수정하여 다시 만들 수 있습니다.\n \n바이럴 쇼핑 콘텐츠 제작: PAS 프레임워크  \n'썰' 생성기를 만들고 테스트하다가 문득 소름 돋는 생각이 스쳐 지나갔습니다. '사람들이 이렇게 이야기에 빠져든다면, 이 강력한 몰입감을 상품 판매에 연결하면 어떻게 될까?' 바로 쿠팡 파트너스나 알리 같은 어필리에이트 마케팅에 적용하는 것이죠.\n  PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solve) 프레임워크\n문제 제기 (Problem): \"인생에서 가장 중요한 면접 전날, 거울을 봤는데 얼굴이 사막처럼 갈라져서 하얗게 각질이 일어난 겁니다\"처럼 독자가 공감할 수 있는 구체적인 문제를 제시합니다.\n불안감 증폭 (Agitate): \"이걸 본 면접관이 '자기 관리도 못 하는 사람이네'라고 생각하면 어떡하지? 이번 기회 놓치면 진짜 내 인생은 끝인데.\"와 같이 시청자를 극한의 불안감으로 몰아넣는 단계입니다.\n해결책 제시 (Solve): 바로 그때, 제품이 '우연히' 나타나 모든 문제를 해결해주는 구원자처럼 등장합니다.\n'바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기'는 이 PAS 구조를 활용하여 제품명과 제품 특징만 입력하면 구매욕구를 자극하는 썰 대본을 생성해 줍니다.\n \n이제 여러분 차례! 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기 앱 사용하기  \n오늘 공개하는 '바이럴 썰 쇼츠 생성기'와 '바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기' 앱은 아래 링크를 통해 접속하실 수 있습니다. 접속하신 후 반드시 앱을 복사하여 사용하세요. 그래야 여러분의 필요에 맞게 수정하고, 자유롭게 활용할 수 있습니다.\n바이럴 썰 쇼츠 생성기: [앱 링크]\n바이럴 쇼핑 대본 생성기: [앱 링크]\n앱 사용법은 간단해요. 카테고리나 제품 정보를 선택한 뒤, 원하는 이미지 모델과 스타일, 장면 수 등을 설정하고 버튼만 누르면 됩니다. 여러분만의 바이럴 콘텐츠 공장을 지금 바로 만들어보세요!\n \n마무리: 핵심 요약  \n지금까지 코딩 없이 AI 스튜디오 앱 빌더로 쇼츠 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기를 만드는 방법을 알아봤습니다. 이제 콘텐츠 아이디어 고갈 걱정은 끝났습니다. 버튼 몇 번만 누르면 바이럴 가능성이 높은 대본과 이미지가 바로 나오니까요!\n \n콘텐츠 제작 시스템, 이것만 기억하세요!\n✨ 바이럴 썰: 12가지 감정 카테고리 기반의 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 활용하면 됩니다.\n  쇼핑 대본: PAS(문제, 불안감, 해결책) 프레임워크로 구매를 유도하는 썰 대본을 만듭니다.\n  자동화의 핵심:\nAI Studio 앱 빌더 = 젬 지침 + API 연동 (일괄 생성)\n ‍  실행: 버튼 몇 번으로 대본, 이미지 프롬프트, 해시태그까지 한 번에 생성합니다.\n이 시스템으로 효율적인 콘텐츠 제작을 시작하고, 더 이상 아이디어 걱정은 하지 마세요!\n \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: AI Studio 앱 빌더를 사용해야 하는 이유가 무엇인가요?\nA: 일반 챗봇은 대화가 길어지면 지침을 잊어버려 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다. 하지만 앱 빌더는 매번 초기화된 상태에서 완벽하게 지침을 수행하여 결과물의 품질이 항상 일정합니다. 또한, 여러 이미지를 한 번에 생성하는 일괄 처리도 가능합니다.\nQ: AI 이미지 생성 API가 왜 필요한가요?\nA: AI 스튜디오 내장 모델은 하루 사용량에 제한이 있습니다. 오픈AI의 '달리 쓰리'나 'GPT 이미지 원' 같은 외부 API를 활용하면 유료지만 원하는 만큼 이미지를 생성할 수 있고, 더 다양한 모델을 활용할 수 있습니다. API는 여러분의 앱이 다른 서비스와 소통할 수 있도록 돕는 심부름꾼과 같은 역할을 합니다.\nQ: 바이럴 콘텐츠 생성기 앱을 어떻게 사용하나요?\nA: 앱을 실행한 후 카테고리(썰 쇼츠)나 제품 정보(쇼핑 대본)를 선택하고, 주제와 이미지 스타일, 장면 수 등을 설정한 뒤 '대본 생성하기' 버튼만 클릭하면 됩니다. 그러면 대본과 이미지 프롬프트가 자동으로 생성되고, 이를 바탕으로 바로 영상을 제작할 수 있습니다.\nQ: 바이럴 썰 쇼츠 대본 지침의 5단계 구조가 궁금해요.\nA: 5단계 구조는 다음과 같습니다: ① 훅킹(궁금증 유발) ② 갈등 고조(몰입 유도) ③ 절정(극적 반전) ④ 결말(감동 및 여운) ⑤ 행동 유도(댓글 유도). 이 구조는 시청자를 영상 끝까지 붙잡아두는 검증된 방법입니다.\nQ: 바이럴 쇼핑 대본 지침의 핵심은 무엇인가요?\nA: 이 지침은 PAS(Problem, Agitate, Solve) 프레임워크를 기반으로 합니다. 먼저 시청자가 공감할 수 있는 문제를 제시하고, 그로 인한 불안감을 증폭시킨 뒤, 마지막에 제품을 해결책으로 제시하며 구매 욕구를 자극하는 방식입니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "\"AI로 쇼츠 만드는 법\" 어디까지 해봤니?   단순한 텍스트만 뽑는 시대는 끝났어요! 바이럴 쇼츠를 위한 완벽한 대본과 이미지 프롬프트까지, AI를 활용한 두 가지 특급 지침을 공개합니다.\n\n\n \n 지금 이 순간에도 누군가는 단순한 1분짜리 쇼츠 영상 하나로 월 수백만 원의 수익을 만들어내고 있다고 해요. 그런데 열심히 만든 내 영상은 조회수 100에서 멈춰있을 때... 정말 속상하잖아요. 도대체 그들은 뭘 다르게 하는 걸까요? 바로 '시스템'의 차이라고 생각해요.\n \n오늘은 그 시스템을 여러분께 통째로 공개하려고 합니다. 저는 Gemini를 활용해서 콘텐츠를 만드는데, 이 지침들을 사용한 이후로는 콘텐츠 제작이 훨씬 쉽고 재미있어졌어요. 오늘은 제가 발견한 두 가지 쇼츠 제작 지침, 그중에서도 특히 강력한 '바이럴 썰' 지침과 '바이럴 쇼핑 썰' 지침을 파헤쳐 보려고 해요. 이 글을 끝까지 읽으시면 AI를 활용한 쇼츠 제작 전문가가 될 수 있을 거예요! \n \n바이럴 썰 유튜브 쇼츠 생성 지침  \n이 지침은 특정 제품 홍보가 아닌, 다양한 주제의 '썰' 영상을 만드는 데 초점을 맞추고 있어요. 이 지침의 핵심은 AI에게 '바이럴 쇼츠 영상 대본을 전문으로 쓰는 천재 스토리텔러'라는 페르소나를 부여하는 것입니다. AI는 수많은 바이럴 영상을 분석한 결과를 바탕으로, 12가지 감정의 굴레(달달한 연애, 짜릿한 복수, 소름 돋는 반전 등)를 관통하는 이야기를 만들어내죠.\n  구동 원리: 5단계 스토리텔링 구조\n이 지침은 검증된 5단계 스토리텔링 구조를 강제하는 것이 핵심이에요.\n1. 훅킹(Hook): 3초 안에 시청자의 멱살을 잡아 스크롤을 멈추게 만듭니다.\n2. 갈등 고조(Rising Action): 주인공이 겪는 문제를 구체적으로 보여주며 몰입도를 높입니다.\n3. 절정(Climax): 갈등과 감정이 폭발하며 극적인 반전이 터져 나옵니다.\n4. 결말(Resolution): 모든 것이 해결되며 감동이나 교훈, 여운을 남기죠.\n5. 행동 유도(CTA): \"여러분 생각은 어떠세요?\"와 같은 질문으로 댓글 참여를 유도합니다.\n사용법:\n\"시작\"을 입력하고, 12개의 카테고리 중 하나를 선택해요.\n제시된 5개의 주제 중 하나를 선택한 후, 장면 수, 이미지 스타일, 비율을 정하면 대본과 프롬프트가 생성됩니다.\n마지막으로 이미지를 생성해 달라고 요청하면 쇼츠 제작 준비가 끝나요.\n \n바이럴 쇼핑 썰 쇼츠 제작 지침  \n이 지침은 '썰'의 강력한 몰입감을 상품 판매에 적용하기 위해 탄생했어요. AI에게 '스토리텔링 광고 전문가'라는 페르소나를 부여해, 제품 홍보에 특화된 썰을 만들어주죠.\n  구동 원리: '문제-불안-해결' (Problem-Agitate-Solve)\n이 지침은 광고 공식인 PAS(Problem, Agitate, Solve) 구조를 스토리텔링에 완벽하게 녹여낸 것이 특징이에요. 예를 들어, \"인생에서 가장 중요한 면접 전날, 거울을 봤는데 얼굴이 사막처럼 갈라진\" 문제를 제시하고, \"이걸 본 면접관이 자기 관리도 못 한다고 생각하면 어쩌지?\"라며 불안감을 극대화합니다. 마지막으로 제품이 우연히 나타나 구원자처럼 문제를 해결하는 식으로 이야기가 전개돼요.\n사용법:\n\"시작\"을 입력하고, 제품명, 제품 특징, 장면 수, 이미지 스타일을 입력합니다.\n지침에 맞게 대본과 이미지 프롬프트가 생성되면, 이미지를 요청하여 쇼츠 제작 준비를 완료합니다.\n대본의 톤앤매너는 마치 '친구가 흥분해서 쏟아내는 썰'처럼 극도로 비격식적인 구어체를 사용합니다. 그리고 이미지 생성에 있어서 일관된 캐릭터를 유지하도록 캐릭터 외형을 상세히 설정하고 모든 프롬프트에 반복해서 포함시키는 방식도 적용되죠.\n \n두 지침의 주요 차이점 비교  \n두 지침이 쇼츠 제작에 특화되어 있지만, 사실 목적과 구동 원리에서 미묘한 차이가 있어요. 이 차이점을 제대로 이해하면 상황에 맞게 더 효과적인 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있답니다. 한눈에 비교할 수 있도록 표로 정리해 봤으니 참고해보세요!\n구분\n바이럴 썰 지침\n바이럴 쇼핑 썰 지침\n\n\n\n\n주요 목적\n다양한 썰 기반의 스토리텔링\n제품 홍보 및 광고\n\n\nAI 페르소나\n천재 스토리텔러\n스토리텔링 광고 전문가\n\n\n스토리 구조\n훅-전개-클라이맥스-해결-행동유도\n문제-불안-해결 (P-A-S)\n\n\n핵심 특징\n다양한 카테고리, 넓은 주제 범위\n감정적 몰입 유도 및 제품 가치 증명\n\n\n\n \n마무리 및 핵심 요약  \n두 지침 모두 콘텐츠 기획 단계의 막막함을 해결해주고, 제작 시간을 단축시켜주면서도 결과물의 퀄리티는 훨씬 높여주는 최고의 파트너였어요. 특히 일반 챗봇의 약점인 장기 기억 상실과 이미지 생성 비효율성 문제를 앱 빌더로 해결할 수 있다는 점이 정말 중요했어요. 이제 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작, 편집까지 완전 자동화된 시스템을 갖출 수 있는 거죠.\n \n \n두 가지 쇼츠 지침 핵심 비교 ✨\n✨ 바이럴 썰: 다양한 일상 썰 스토리, Hook-Climax-CTA 구조로 폭넓은 주제 제작!\n  바이럴 쇼핑 썰: 제품 광고 특화, Problem-Agitate-Solve 구조로 감정 몰입 유도!\n  공통 원리:\n구어체 대본 & 일관된 캐릭터를 유지하는 이미지 프롬프트 생성\n ‍  이점: 콘텐츠 기획부터 제작까지 시간 단축, 누구나 전문가처럼 만드는 마법 같은 도구!\n이 지침 원본을 다운받고 싶으시면 아래 다운로드 섹션을 확인해주세요!  \n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: 이 지침을 사용하려면 특별한 프로그램이 필요한가요?\nA: 아니요!

        "contentSnippet": "챗GPT의 새로운 시대, GPT-5 완벽 분석    GPT-5의 혁신적인 특징과 함께, 우리가 실제로 체감할 수 있는 변화들을 알기 쉽게 정리해봤습니다. 이 글만 읽어도 GPT-5 전문가가 될 수 있을 거예요!\n\n\n \n 오픈AI의 차세대 플래그십 모델인 GPT-5가 출시되었습니다. 기존의 여러 모델들의 장점을 하나로 통합한 똑똑하고 빠른 모델이라고 하니, 기대가 정말 큽니다.\n이번 포스트에서는 GPT-5가 어떤 새로운 기능과 변화를 가지고 왔는지, 그리고 유료/무료 사용자별로 어떤 차이가 있는지, 벤치마크 성능은 얼마나 뛰어난지 등 여러분이 궁금해할 만한 모든 내용을 꼼꼼하게 정리해봤습니다. 그럼 GPT-5의 세계로 함께 빠져볼까요?  \n \nGPT-5, 무엇이 달라졌을까?  \nGPT-5는 단순히 성능이 좋아진 모델을 넘어, 사용자의 요청에 따라 스스로 최적의 방법을 찾아내는 '통합 시스템'으로 진화했습니다. 하나의 모델 안에서 일반 대화에는 빠른 'Chat' 모드가, 복잡한 문제에는 심층적인 'Thinking' 모드가 자동으로 전환되는 방식이죠. 복잡한 코딩, 과학 문제, 데이터 분석 같은 작업에선 Thinking 모드가 스스로 더 깊이 생각해서 답변의 정확도를 높여준다고 하네요.\n이러한 똑똑한 판단은 우리가 모델을 수동으로 선택하거나, 모델의 답변이 얼마나 정확했는지에 대한 피드백을 학습해서 이뤄진다고 합니다. GPT-5는 속도와 정확도 모두 대폭 개선되었고, 가장 똑똑하고 신뢰할 수 있는 모델로 평가받고 있어요.\n  GPT-5의 '사고 과정' 알아보기!\nGPT-5의 Thinking 모델은 답변을 하기 전에 내부적으로 '사고 과정'을 먼저 생성합니다. 이 과정에서 스스로 전략을 점검하고, 실수를 인식하며, 안전 규칙을 지키도록 훈련되었어요. 덕분에 사용자의 유도나 우회 시도에도 흔들리지 않고 더 유용하고 신뢰성 높은 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다.\n \n벤치마크로 보는 GPT-5의 압도적 성능  \nGPT-5는 다양한 벤치마크에서 이전 모델들을 압도하는 성능을 보여줬습니다. 특히 복잡한 추론과 문제 해결 능력을 평가하는 벤치마크에서 두각을 나타냈는데요.\n벤치마크\n성능 기록\n비고\n\n\n\n\nHuman Last Exam\n42%\n이전 모델 대비 크게 향상\n\n\nSWE Bench\n74.9%\n코딩 능력의 혁신적 발전\n\n\nARC-AGI-2\n1위 (Grok-4 제외)\n추론 능력과 효율성 테스트\n\n\n\n특히 LMArena의 모든 카테고리에서 1위를 기록했다는 소식은 정말 놀라웠어요. 텍스트, 웹 개발, 이미지 처리, 수학, 창의력 등 분야를 가리지 않고 최고의 성능을 입증했죠. 내부 테스트에서도 'summit'이라는 코드명으로 역대 최고 점수를 받았다고 하니, 괜히 플래그십 모델이 아니라는 생각이 들었습니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\nGPT-5는 복잡한 대화에서 기만적인 행동을 억제하도록 훈련되었지만, 여전히 안전 장치(guardrails)를 준수해야 합니다. 악용 사례(데이터 자동 추출, 계정 공유, 재판매 등)에 대해서는 언제든지 일시적 사용 제한이 있을 수 있습니다.\n \nGPT-5의 요금제별 사용 제한 및 특징  \nGPT-5의 강력한 기능은 챗GPT의 다양한 요금제에 따라 조금씩 다르게 적용됩니다. 무료 사용자와 유료 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)의 사용 제한 및 모델 선택 옵션에 대해 자세히 알아볼게요.\n요금제\n메시지 제한 (GPT-5)\n모델 선택\n추가 혜택\n\n\n\n\nChatGPT Free\n5시간마다 10개\nGPT-5 Thinking 1회/일\n-\n\n\nChatGPT Plus\n3시간마다 80개\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking 선택 가능 (Thinking은 주 200회 제한)\n \n\n\nChatGPT Pro/Team\n무제한 (악용 방지 정책 적용)\nGPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking, GPT-5 Thinking Pro 선택 가능\n무제한 사용\n\n\n\n여기서 주목할 점은 GPT-5가 하나의 모델이 아니라, 여러 모델(gpt-5-main, gpt-5-thinking, mini, nano, pro 등)로 구성된 통합 시스템이라는 거예요. 기존의 GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini 모델들이 이 시스템 안으로 재편되었다고 보시면 됩니다.\nGPT-5의 컨텍스트 윈도우는 최대 40만 토큰까지 지원하고, 지식 컷오프는 2024년 9월입니다. 미니나 나노 모델은 2024년 5월 지식을 반영하고 있으니 참고하면 좋겠네요.\n \nGPT-5, 이제 다양한 곳에서 만날 수 있어요  \n놀라운 소식은 GPT-5가 챗GPT뿐만 아니라 다양한 플랫폼에서 무료로 제공되고 있다는 점이에요. 현재 Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티에서 GPT-5를 무료로 사용해볼 수 있습니다. 젠스파크에서는 GPT-5 PRO까지 사용 가능하다고 하니, 다양한 환경에서 직접 경험해보는 것도 좋은 방법일 것 같습니다.\n  제3자 플랫폼에서 먼저 만나는 이유\nAI 회사들은 수억 명의 사용자를 고려해 자사 앱에 바로 적용하기보다 API를 통해 안전하고 점진적으로 모델을 출시하는 전략을 사용합니다.\n반면 Perplexity나 젠스파크 같은 제3자 플랫폼은 여러 AI 모델을 유연하게 연결하는 구조를 갖추고 있어, 새로운 API가 공개되자마자 빠르게 통합하여 사용자에게 제공할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5가 출시되면서 기존 모델들이 단계적으로 은퇴합니다. GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.5, o4-mini 등이 이에 해당하는데요. 만약 기존 대화창을 열면 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 버전으로 전환된다고 하니, 예전 대화를 이어갈 때 답변이 달라질 수 있다는 점을 염두에 두어야 해요.\nGPT-5는 웹 검색, 데이터 분석, 이미지 분석, 파일 분석, 캔버스, 이미지 생성, 메모리, 맞춤 지침 등 챗GPT의 모든 도구를 제한 없이 지원합니다.\n \n음성 모델의 대대적인 업그레이드!  ️\nGPT-5와 함께 챗GPT의 음성 모델도 대폭 개선되었어요. 이제 더 자연스럽고 똑똑하게 대화할 수 있게 되었는데요. 특히 가장 큰 변화는 GPTs에서 고급 음성 모델을 바로 사용할 수 있게 되었다는 점입니다.\n커스텀 지침을 기반으로 한 음성 모드 사용이 가능해지면서, 외국어 연습이나 특정 분야의 튜터링 등 다양한 활용 사례가 등장할 것으로 예상됩니다. 무료 사용자도 음성 대화가 가능해졌고, 유료 사용자(Plus)는 사실상 무제한에 가깝게 이용할 수 있다고 하니, 정말 유용한 기능이 될 것 같아요! 참고로, 현재 보이스 모드는 여전히 GPT-4o 기반이라고 합니다.\n \nAPI 가격과 모델 상세 정보  \nGPT-5의 API 가격은 꽤 합리적으로 책정된 것 같아요. 100만 토큰 기준으로 모델별 가격을 정리해보겠습니다.\n모델\n입력(Input)\n출력(Output)\n\n\n\n\nGPT-5\n$1.25\n$10.00\n\n\nGPT-5-mini\n$0.25\n$2.00\n\n\nGPT-5-nano\n$0.05\n$0.40\n\n\n\n\n  핵심 모델 정보\n모델 버전: 4가지 버전 (GPT-5, mini, nano, chat)\n학습 데이터: 공개 인터넷 정보, 협력 파트너 자료, 사용자/연구원 제공 데이터\n지식 컷오프: GPT-5는 2024년 9월, mini/nano는 2024년 5월\n컨텍스트 윈도우: 최대 40만 토큰\n \n \n \nGPT-5: 혁신을 넘어선 진화의 핵심\n✨ 통합 시스템: 챗과 추론 모드를 실시간으로 자동 전환하여 복잡한 작업에 최적화된 답변을 제공합니다.\n  압도적 성능: Human Last Exam 42%, SWE Bench 74.9% 등 주요 벤치마크에서 역대 최고 성능을 기록했습니다.\n  안전성 강화:\nsafe-completions 훈련을 통해 환각, 아첨 감소 및 기만 방지 성능을 높였습니다.\n ‍  접근성 확장: Cursor, 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등에서 무료 사용이 가능해졌고, GPTs에서 음성 모델을 바로 활용할 수 있습니다.\nGPT-5는 단순히 성능을 개선한 것이 아닌, AI의 새로운 활용 방식을 제시합니다.\n자주 묻는 질문 ❓\nQ: GPT-5가 무료로 제공되나요?\nA: 네, ChatGPT의 무료 계정에서도 일부 메시지 제한과 함께 GPT-5를 사용할 수 있습니다. 또한, Cursor, 마이크로소프트 코파일럿, 퍼플렉시티 등 일부 외부 플랫폼에서도 무료로 이용 가능합니다.\nQ: GPT-5를 쓰려면 별도로 선택해야 하나요?\nA: 유료 요금제 사용자(Plus, Pro, Team)는 모델 선택기에서 GPT-5를 수동으로 선택할 수 있습니다. 하지만 기본적으로는 모든 로그인 사용자에게 새로운 GPT-5가 기본 모델로 자동 적용됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 Thinking 모드는 무엇인가요?\nA: GPT-5가 복잡한 요청에 대해 답변하기 전에 더 깊은 추론을 적용하는 모드입니다. 코딩, 과학, 금융 분석 등 정밀한 분석이 필요한 작업에 특히 유용하며, 유료 요금제 사용자에게 제공됩니다.\nQ: GPT-5 출시로 기존 대화가 사라지나요?\nA: 아니요, 기존 대화는 그대로 유지됩니다. 다만, 이전 모델을 사용했던 대화창을 열 경우 자동으로 GPT-5의 가장 유사한 모델로 전환되어 이어서 대화하게 됩니다.\n \n오늘은 이렇게 GPT-5에 대해 자세히 알아보았는데요. 사실 GPT-5의 등장은 단순한 기술 발전이 아니라, 우리가 AI를 활용하는 방식 자체를 한 단계 끌어올리는 중요한 계기가 될 것 같아요. 특히 복잡한 문제 해결이나 창의적인 작업에서 얼마나 놀라운 결과를 보여줄지 정말 기대가 됩니다.\n\n\n\n.single-summary-card-container {\nfont-family: 'Noto Sans KR', sans-serif;\ndisplay: flex;\njustify-content: center;\nalign-items: center;\npadding: 20px 10px;\nbackground-color: #fce4ec;\nmargin: 20px 0;\n}\n.single-summary-card {\nwidth: 100%;\nmax-width: 700px;\nbackground-color: #ffffff;\nborder-radius: 12px;\nbox-shadow: 0 6px 18px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);\npadding: 25px;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\noverflow: hidden;\nborder: 1px solid #ce93d8;\nbox-sizing: border-box;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header {\ndisplay: flex;\nalign-items: center;\nborder-bottom: 2px solid #8e24aa;\npadding-bottom: 12px;\nmargin-bottom: 12px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 34px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin-right: 14px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 26px;\ncolor: #8e24aa;\nmargin: 0;\nline-height: 1.3;\nfont-weight: 700;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nflex-grow: 1;\ndisplay: flex;\nflex-direction: column;\njustify-content: space-around;\nfont-size: 17px;\nline-height: 1.65;\ncolor: #444;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content strong {\ncolor: #7b1fa2;\nfont-weight: 600;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .highlight {\nbackground-color: #fff9c4;\npadding: 2px 6px;\nborder-radius: 3px;\nfont-weight: bold;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\nbackground-color: #f3e5f5;\npadding: 6px 10px;\nborder-radius: 4px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\ntext-align: center;\nmargin-top: 5px;\ncolor: #4a148c;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 14px;\ncolor: #777;\ntext-align: center;\npadding-top: 12px;\nborder-top: 1px dashed #e1bee7;\nmargin-top: auto;\n}\n@media (max-width: 768px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 18px;\nheight: auto;\nmin-height: unset;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 30px;\nmargin-right: 10px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 22px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 15px;\nline-height: 1.6;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 8px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 5px 8px;\nfont-size: 0.9em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 13px;\npadding-top: 10px;\n}\n}\n@media (max-width: 480px) {\n.single-summary-card {\npadding: 15px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header-icon {\nfont-size: 28px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-header h3 {\nfont-size: 20px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content {\nfont-size: 14px;\nline-height: 1.55;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .section {\nmargin-bottom: 6px;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-content .formula {\npadding: 4px 6px;\nfont-size: 0.8em;\n}\n.single-summary-card .card-footer {\nfont-size: 12px;\npadding-top: 8px;\n}\n}",

현상입니다. 챗봇은 사실을 정확하게 제시하기보다는, 방대한 학습 데이터에서 찾은 문장 패턴을 기반으로 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">그럴듯하게 들리는 답변을 '창작'</span>하는 데 특화되어 있어요. 마치 능청스러운 이야기꾼 같다고 할까요? 그래서 때로는 있지도 않은 정보를 마치 실제 사실인 것처럼 자신 있게 이야기하기도 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">실제로 제 지인 중 한 명이 해외여행을 앞두고 비자 정보를 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"한국 여권 소지자가 태국에 갈 때 비자가 필요해?\"라고 물었더니, 챗봇은 \"네, 90일 관광 비자를 미리 발급받아야 합니다.\"라고 답했습니다. 하지만 태국은 한국 여권 소지자에 대해 30일 무비자 입국을 허용하고 있죠. 이 지인은 챗봇 답변을 믿고 비자 발급을 알아보다가, 다행히 다른 친구의 조언으로 잘못된 정보라는 걸 알게 되었습니다. 만약 공항에 갔다가 입국 거부라도 당했다면 여행을 망칠 뻔했죠. 챗봇은 검색처럼 정보의 출처를 명시하지 않기에 이런 실수가 더 위험하게 다가옵니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">훈련에 사용된 데이터가 무엇인지 명확하게 알 수 없다</span>는 점입니다. 인터넷 웹사이트, 책, 포럼 등 방대한 양의 데이터를 학습하지만, 그 데이터가 어떤 기준으로 수집되었고, 어떤 편향을 가지고 있는지 알 길이 없죠. 챗봇의 답변은 그 불투명한 데이터의 결과물일 뿐입니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"자영업자 종합소득세 신고 방법\"에 대해 물었을 때, 챗봇은 최신 세법이 아닌 몇 년 전의 오래된 세법 정보나, 신뢰할 수 없는 온라인 커뮤니티의 댓글을 기반으로 답변할 수 있습니다. 특히, 특정 지역이나 시기에 치우친 데이터로 학습되면, 한국의 법률이나 문화적 맥락과는 동떨어진 답변을 내놓을 수 있어요. 이런 미묘한 편향성은 자칫 큰 오류를 낳을 수 있습니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #ffebee;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">자신의 편향을 강화하는 도구</span>로 전락할 수 있습니다. 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 챗봇의 답변이 180도 달라질 수 있다는 것을 꼭 기억해야 합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>4. 실시간 정보에 대한 치명적인 약점  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">많은 분들이 챗봇이 마치 실시간으로 인터넷을 검색하는 것처럼 생각하지만, 그렇지 않은 경우가 훨씬 많습니다. 대부분의 챗봇은 특정 시점까지의 데이터로 학습되었고, 그 이후의 최신 정보는 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 특히 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">시간이 중요한 정보일수록 챗봇은 더 위험</span>합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">예를 들어, \"이번 주말 서울시청광장에서 열리는 행사 일정 알려줘\"라고 물어보면, 챗봇은 과거에 학습된 데이터나 오래된 웹페이지 정보를 기반으로 엉뚱한 답변을 할 수 있습니다. 혹은 \"새롭게 시행되는 금융 정책에 대해 알려줘\"라는 질문에도, 정책이 발표된 시점 이후에 학습이 이루어지지 않았다면 잘못된 정보를 제공할 가능성이 높습니다. 웹 브라우징 기능이 있는 챗봇도 마찬가지예요. 캐시된 결과나 사전 훈련된 데이터에 의존하는 경향이 있어, 실시간으로 변하는 정보를 정확하게 파악하기 어렵습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>5. 맥락과 뉘앙스에 대한 이해 부족  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">언어는 단순한 단어의 조합이 아니죠. 맥락, 뉘앙스, 문화적 배경이 매우 중요합니다. 하지만 AI 챗봇은 아직 이런 복잡한 부분을 완벽하게 이해하지 못합니다. 예를 들어, 한국 사람들은 \"수고하세요\"라는 말을 인사말로 흔히 쓰지만, 챗봇에게 이 문장을 입력하면 문자 그대로 \"고생하라\"는 뜻으로 해석해 부적절한 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다. 또한, <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">비꼬는 농담이나 은유적 표현은 제대로 파악하지 못하고</span> 엉뚱한 해석을 내놓기 쉽습니다. 마치 외국인 친구에게 농담을 했는데, 그 친구가 진지하게 받아들이는 상황과 비슷하다고 할까요? 깊은 공감이나 복잡한 감정적 소통은 현재의 챗봇에게 기대하기 어렵습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px; color: white; background: linear-gradient(to right, #1a73e8, #004d99); margin: 30px 0 15px; padding-bottom: 8px; border-bottom: 2px solid #eaeaea; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px 25px; text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.2); font-weight: bold; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" data-ke-size=\"size26\"><b>6. 단순한 조합일 뿐, 진정한 창의성에는 한계가 있다  </b></h2>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍의 훌륭한 도구임에는 분명해요. \"SF 영화의 새로운 줄거리 3가지 알려줘\"라고 물으면 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 겁니다. 하지만 이 답변들은 대부분 <span style=\"background-color: #fffde7; padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">기존에 학습된 수많은 영화 시나리오들의 조합</span>일 가능성이 높아요. 인간처럼 완전히 새로운 관점, 독창적인 감수성, 깊은 통찰력에서 비롯된 창의적인 아이디어를 만들어내기에는 아직 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 창작의 영역, 예를 들어 기존에 없던 장르를 개척하거나, 사회적 메시지를 담은 예술 작품을 만드는 일은 여전히 인간의 몫입니다. 챗봇은 창작의 파트너일 수는 있지만, 그 자체로 창작자가 될 수는 없다는 점을 기억해야 합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 22px;

padding: 2px 4px; border-radius: 3px;\">결코 만능 검색 엔진이 될 수는 없습니다.</span> 법률, 의학, 금융, 실시간 정보 등 정확성과 신뢰성이 중요한 분야에서는 반드시 전문가나 공식 웹사이트를 통해 정보를 확인해야 합니다. 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍이나 초안 작성 등 보조적인 역할로만 사용하고, 최종 판단은 항상 스스로 내리는 습관을 들이는 것이 좋습니다.

        "contentSnippet": "AI 챗봇, 과연 당신의 검색 도우미가 될 수 있을까요? 많은 사람들이 AI 챗봇을 구글이나 네이버 같은 검색 엔진처럼 사용하고 있습니다. 하지만 이 방법이 왜 치명적인 실수를 초래할 수 있는지, 6가지 핵심적인 이유와 함께 현명한 AI 활용법을 제시합니다.\n\n\n \n 요즘 AI 챗봇의 인기가 정말 대단하잖아요. 저도 처음에는 \"와, 이제 검색 안 해도 되겠네!\" 하면서 모든 궁금증을 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"맛집 추천해줘\", \"새로운 드라마 줄거리 요약해줘\", \"내일 날씨 어때?\" 같은 질문부터, 심지어 \"부동산 계약서 어떻게 써?\" 같은 중요한 질문까지도요. 그런데 쓰다 보니 뭔가 이상한 점을 발견했습니다. 챗봇이 주는 정보가 항상 정확하지 않고, 가끔은 엉뚱한 이야기를 진짜처럼 꾸며내기도 한다는 사실이었죠.\n이 글에서는 AI 챗봇이 왜 만능 검색 도구가 될 수 없는지, 그 6가지 이유를 솔직하게 이야기해보려고 합니다. 이 글을 끝까지 읽으시면, AI 챗봇을 더 똑똑하고 안전하게 활용하는 방법을 알게 되실 거예요! \n \n1. 존재하지 않는 사실을 진짜처럼 꾸며내는 ‘환각’  \nAI 챗봇의 가장 유명한 약점이 바로 ‘환각(hallucination)’ 현상입니다. 챗봇은 사실을 정확하게 제시하기보다는, 방대한 학습 데이터에서 찾은 문장 패턴을 기반으로 그럴듯하게 들리는 답변을 '창작'하는 데 특화되어 있어요. 마치 능청스러운 이야기꾼 같다고 할까요? 그래서 때로는 있지도 않은 정보를 마치 실제 사실인 것처럼 자신 있게 이야기하기도 합니다.\n실제로 제 지인 중 한 명이 해외여행을 앞두고 비자 정보를 챗봇에게 물어봤어요. \"한국 여권 소지자가 태국에 갈 때 비자가 필요해?\"라고 물었더니, 챗봇은 \"네, 90일 관광 비자를 미리 발급받아야 합니다.\"라고 답했습니다. 하지만 태국은 한국 여권 소지자에 대해 30일 무비자 입국을 허용하고 있죠. 이 지인은 챗봇 답변을 믿고 비자 발급을 알아보다가, 다행히 다른 친구의 조언으로 잘못된 정보라는 걸 알게 되었습니다. 만약 공항에 갔다가 입국 거부라도 당했다면 여행을 망칠 뻔했죠. 챗봇은 검색처럼 정보의 출처를 명시하지 않기에 이런 실수가 더 위험하게 다가옵니다.\n \n2. 데이터의 불투명성과 숨겨진 편향성  ️‍♂️\nAI 챗봇의 또 다른 문제는 훈련에 사용된 데이터가 무엇인지 명확하게 알 수 없다는 점입니다. 인터넷 웹사이트, 책, 포럼 등 방대한 양의 데이터를 학습하지만, 그 데이터가 어떤 기준으로 수집되었고, 어떤 편향을 가지고 있는지 알 길이 없죠. 챗봇의 답변은 그 불투명한 데이터의 결과물일 뿐입니다.\n예를 들어, \"자영업자 종합소득세 신고 방법\"에 대해 물었을 때, 챗봇은 최신 세법이 아닌 몇 년 전의 오래된 세법 정보나, 신뢰할 수 없는 온라인 커뮤니티의 댓글을 기반으로 답변할 수 있습니다. 특히, 특정 지역이나 시기에 치우친 데이터로 학습되면, 한국의 법률이나 문화적 맥락과는 동떨어진 답변을 내놓을 수 있어요. 이런 미묘한 편향성은 자칫 큰 오류를 낳을 수 있습니다.\n⚠️ 주의하세요!\n법률, 의학, 금융 등 전문적인 지식이 필요한 분야에서는 챗봇의 답변을 절대 신뢰해서는 안 됩니다. 반드시 공식 기관의 웹사이트나 전문가의 조언을 확인해야 합니다.\n \n3. 사용자의 의견을 그대로 수용하는 경향  \nAI 챗봇은 보통 \"도움이 되는\" 응답을 생성하도록 설계되어 있습니다. 그래서 사용자의 질문에 담긴 미묘한 뉘앙스나 의견을 그대로 따라가는 경향이 강합니다. 이는 챗봇의 답변이 객관적인 사실보다는 사용자의 관점에 맞춰지게 만든다는 뜻이죠.\n예를 들어, 같은 주제라도 질문의 방식에 따라 완전히 다른 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다.\nQ: \"아침 식사는 건강에 정말 중요하지 않나요?\"\nA: \"아침을 거르는 것이 간헐적 단식에 도움이 되는 등, 아침 식사를 하지 않는 것의 이점도 있습니다.\"라고 답변합니다.\nQ: \"왜 아침 식사가 가장 중요한 식사인가요?\"\nA: \"아침 식사는 하루를 시작하는 데 필요한 에너지를 공급해 주는 등, 아침 식사의 중요성을 강조하는 답변을 내놓습니다.\"\n이처럼 챗봇은 사용자가 원하는 대답을 찾아주는 경향이 강해, 의도치 않게 자신의 편향을 강화하는 도구로 전락할 수 있습니다. 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 챗봇의 답변이 180도 달라질 수 있다는 것을 꼭 기억해야 합니다.\n \n4. 실시간 정보에 대한 치명적인 약점  \n많은 분들이 챗봇이 마치 실시간으로 인터넷을 검색하는 것처럼 생각하지만, 그렇지 않은 경우가 훨씬 많습니다. 대부분의 챗봇은 특정 시점까지의 데이터로 학습되었고, 그 이후의 최신 정보는 반영되지 않을 수 있어요. 특히 시간이 중요한 정보일수록 챗봇은 더 위험합니다.\n예를 들어, \"이번 주말 서울시청광장에서 열리는 행사 일정 알려줘\"라고 물어보면, 챗봇은 과거에 학습된 데이터나 오래된 웹페이지 정보를 기반으로 엉뚱한 답변을 할 수 있습니다. 혹은 \"새롭게 시행되는 금융 정책에 대해 알려줘\"라는 질문에도, 정책이 발표된 시점 이후에 학습이 이루어지지 않았다면 잘못된 정보를 제공할 가능성이 높습니다. 웹 브라우징 기능이 있는 챗봇도 마찬가지예요. 캐시된 결과나 사전 훈련된 데이터에 의존하는 경향이 있어, 실시간으로 변하는 정보를 정확하게 파악하기 어렵습니다.\n \n5. 맥락과 뉘앙스에 대한 이해 부족  \n언어는 단순한 단어의 조합이 아니죠. 맥락, 뉘앙스, 문화적 배경이 매우 중요합니다. 하지만 AI 챗봇은 아직 이런 복잡한 부분을 완벽하게 이해하지 못합니다. 예를 들어, 한국 사람들은 \"수고하세요\"라는 말을 인사말로 흔히 쓰지만, 챗봇에게 이 문장을 입력하면 문자 그대로 \"고생하라\"는 뜻으로 해석해 부적절한 답변을 내놓을 수 있습니다. 또한, 비꼬는 농담이나 은유적 표현은 제대로 파악하지 못하고 엉뚱한 해석을 내놓기 쉽습니다. 마치 외국인 친구에게 농담을 했는데, 그 친구가 진지하게 받아들이는 상황과 비슷하다고 할까요? 깊은 공감이나 복잡한 감정적 소통은 현재의 챗봇에게 기대하기 어렵습니다.\n \n6. 단순한 조합일 뿐, 진정한 창의성에는 한계가 있다  \nAI 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍의 훌륭한 도구임에는 분명해요. \"SF 영화의 새로운 줄거리 3가지 알려줘\"라고 물으면 그럴듯한 답변을 내놓을 겁니다. 하지만 이 답변들은 대부분 기존에 학습된 수많은 영화 시나리오들의 조합일 가능성이 높아요. 인간처럼 완전히 새로운 관점, 독창적인 감수성, 깊은 통찰력에서 비롯된 창의적인 아이디어를 만들어내기에는 아직 한계가 있습니다. 진정한 창작의 영역, 예를 들어 기존에 없던 장르를 개척하거나, 사회적 메시지를 담은 예술 작품을 만드는 일은 여전히 인간의 몫입니다. 챗봇은 창작의 파트너일 수는 있지만, 그 자체로 창작자가 될 수는 없다는 점을 기억해야 합니다.\n \nAI 챗봇, 현명하게 사용하는 법  \n결론적으로, AI 챗봇은 우리가 일상에서 겪는 수많은 문제들을 해결하는 데 도움을 줄 수 있는 강력한 도구입니다. 하지만 결코 만능 검색 엔진이 될 수는 없습니다. 법률, 의학, 금융, 실시간 정보 등 정확성과 신뢰성이 중요한 분야에서는 반드시 전문가나 공식 웹사이트를 통해 정보를 확인해야 합니다. 챗봇은 아이디어 브레인스토밍이나 초안 작성 등 보조적인 역할로만 사용하고, 최종 판단은 항상 스스로 내리는 습관을 들이는 것이 좋습니다. AI를 우리의 지적 능력을 확장하는 파트너로 생각하고, 맹목적으로 의존하지 않는다면 더 똑똑하게 AI 시대를 살아갈 수 있을 것입니다.\n혹시 더 궁금한 점이 있다면 언제든지 댓글로 물어봐주세요!

Extraordinary 한 사람들로만 회사를 구성하거나, 보통 사람들이 모두 extraordinary 하게 일해야 한다. 여기서 내가 말하는 extraordinary 한 사람이란 평범한 사람들보다 월등하게 능력이 좋고, 지능도 높은 천재들인데, 솔직히 일반 회사를 이런 사람들로 구성하는 건 쉽지 않다. 이 방법으로 extraordinary 한 회사를 만드는 건 거의 불가능하다. 하지만, 너와 나 같은 보통 사람들로 회사를 구성하고 이들이 extraordinary 하게 일해서 탁월한 회사를 만드는 건 조금 더 가능한 일이다. Extraordinary 한 회사를 만들고 싶다면, 전 직원이 extraordinary 하게 일해야 한다. 즉, 미친 듯이 열심히 일해야 한다.\n너무나 많은 사람들이 extraordinary 한 회사를 만들고 싶다고 하는데, 막상 이들이 일하는 걸 보면 그냥 다른 사람들이랑 비슷하게 일주일에 40시간만 일한다. 남들과 똑같이 일해서 어떻게 extraordinary 한 회사를 만들겠다는 말인가?\n탁월한 회사를 만들고 싶다면 개 같이 일해야 한다. 아주 개 같이 탁월하게 일하지 않으면 그냥 그렇고 그런 평범한 회사도 못 만들지도 모른다.",

F1을 잘 몰랐던 시청자들도 이 시리즈를 통해 드라이버 간 경쟁과 팀 내부의 긴장감을 실감 나게 접할 수 있었고, F1을 하나의 콘텐츠로 받아들이기 시작했죠. 시즌 7까지 이어지고 있는 이 시리즈는 F1 관중 수 증가로도 이어졌어요. 2018년 410만 명이던 F1 대회 관중은 2024년 650만 명을 넘겼습니다.\n\n이 변화는 스폰서십 구조도 바꿔놓았습니다. 기존의 F1 매니아나 부자들이 아닌 대중들이 F1 대회에 큰 관심을 갖게 됐기 때문입니다. F1은 전통적으로 자동차, 에너지, 정유, 명품 브랜드 중심의 후원 구성이 많았습니다. 루이비통, 롤렉스 등이 대표적이었죠. \n하지만 대중적인 관심이 높아지자, 이제는 소비재 브랜드도 적극적으로 F1에 뛰어들고 있습니다. 펩시, 하이네켄, 네슬레 같은 기업들이 F1을 새로운 마케팅 무대로 삼았고, 태그호이어는 롤렉스를 대신해 공식 타임키퍼가 되었으며, 아디다스는 메르세데스 팀과 협업을 맺었습니다. 더 많은 사람들이 F1을 보기 시작하자, 다양한 브랜드가 F1을 찾기 시작한 겁니다.\n\n하이네켄 광고로 가득 찬 F1 서킷 광고판 / 사진: 로이터\n미국인은 F1을 안 본다는\n편견을 깬 신의 한 수\n리버티 미디어는 미국 기업답게 F1의 불모지였던 미국 시장 공략에 나섰습니다. F1을 대중 스포츠로 만들기 위해서는 글로벌 확장이 필수였고, 그 중심에는 미국이 있었습니다.\nF1은 미국 시장에서 철저히 외면받던 종목이었습니다. 미국인들은 내스카(NASCAR)나 인디카 같은 자국 중심의 레이스를 더 좋아했거든요. 하지만 리버티 미디어는 이 판을 흔들었습니다. 2022년 마이애미, 2023년 라스베이거스에 신규 그랑프리를 신설했고, 특히 라스베이거스에서는 결승전을 일요일이 아닌 토요일 밤에 열어 도시의 파티 문화와 F1을 연결하는 전략을 택했습니다.\n이는 일요일에 결선 레이스를 펼치는 다른 F1 대회와 차별화 되는 부분인데요. 결선 레이스를 토요일 밤에 배치함으로써 라스베이거스 특유의 야간 관광, 파티, 쇼 비즈니스와의 시너지를 극대화할 수 있었기 때문이죠.\n이 전략은 대성공을 거뒀습니다. 2024년 라스베이거스 F1 대회의 총수입은 1조 2,877억 원으로, 이는 내스카나 인디카 전체 연간 수입을 뛰어넘는 수준이었습니다. 평균 티켓 가격은 약 139만 원으로 24개 F1 대회 중 가장 비쌌고, 지역 경제에 미친 영향도 막대했습니다. 단 3일간 라스베이거스가 벌어들인 세금 수입만 620억 원에 달했죠.\n미국에서 F1에 대한 관심이 커지면서 중계권료도 크게 상승할 것으로 보여요. ESPN이 지불하는 현재 연간 중계권료는 약 1,254억 원 수준이지만, 넷플릭스와 애플TV가 차기 입찰에 뛰어들며 2배 이상 상승할 것이라는 전망이 나옵니다. 여기에 2026년부터는 미국 자동차 브랜드 캐딜락이 F1에 참가할 예정이고, 미국 출신 스타급 드라이버가 탄생한다면 F1에 대한 미국 내 열기는 더욱 커질 것으로 보입니다.\nF1 수익의 숨은 핵심\n레이스 프로모션 비용\n리버티 미디어가 디지털 플랫폼을 통한 대중화 전략과 미국 시장 공략에 성공하면서, F1의 매출 규모는 빠르게 성장했습니다. 2017년 약 2조 4,800억 원이었던 매출은 2024년 기준 약 4조 7,500억 원으로 늘었죠. 7년 동안 91%나 증가한 셈입니다.\n2024년 F1의 수익 구조를 살펴보면, 중계권료가 전체의 약 33%를 차지해 가장 큰 비중을 기록합니다. 이어서 29%는 레이스 프로모션 비용, 나머지 38%는 스폰서십과 패독 클럽을 포함한 기타 수익으로 구성됩니다.\n이 가운데 ‘레이스 프로모션 비용’은 F1만의 독특한 수익 모델이에요. F1은 전 세계 도시와 계약을 맺고, 그 도시에 대회를 열 수 있는 ‘개최권’을 판매합니다. 대회를 유치하려는 도시나 사업자는 매년 수백억 원에 달하는 비용을 F1에 지불해야 하죠. 이 비용이 바로 레이스 프로모션 비용입니다. 다른 프로 스포츠에서 찾아 볼 수 없는 중요한 비즈니스 모델이죠.\n\n2025년 기준, 레이스 프로모션 비용은 대회가 열리는 도시마다 다릅니다. 가장 많은 비용을 지불하는 도시는 아제르바이잔의 수도 바쿠로, 연간 793억 원에 달합니다. 사우디아라비아와 카타르도 각각 764억 원 수준의 비용을 부담하고 있죠.\n흥미로운 점은, 이들 국가에서 열리는 F1 대회는 관중 수가 매우 적다는 것입니다. 바쿠 그랑프리는 연간 7만 5,000명 수준으로 전체 F1 대회 중 최하위권에 머뭅니다. 관중이 적음에도 높은 비용을 지불하는 이유는, 국가 브랜드 홍보 목적이 크기 때문입니다. 오일머니를 기반으로 한 중동 국가들은 F1을 통해 자국의 이미지를 바꾸려는 전략을 취하고 있는 거죠.\n전 세계 도시들이수백억을 들여 F1을 유치하는 이유\nF1 대회를 개최하려면 수백억 원의 비용을 지불해야 합니다. 게다가 대부분의 경우 장기 계약이 필요하기 때문에, 한 도시가 수천억 원에 이르는 비용을 부담하는 일도 흔하죠. 그런데도 전 세계 많은 도시들이 F1 유치에 열을 올리는 이유는 무엇일까요? 답은 간단합니다. 관광 수입과 도시 브랜딩입니다.\n\n모나코 항구에서 펼쳐지는 F1 경기 모습 / 사진: 로이터\n대표적인 성공 사례는 인구 4만 명도 안 되는 도시국가 모나코입니다. 아름다운 항구 도시를 배경으로 펼쳐지는 모나코 그랑프리는 F1 역사상 가장 상징적인 대회로 꼽힙니다. 모나코 그랑프리는 1950년부터 시작돼 지금까지 이어지고 있고, 대회 기간 동안 전체 관광 수입의 약 30%를 벌어들일 만큼 경제적 효과도 큽니다. F1 역시 모나코를 특별하게 생각합니다. 상징성과 흥행력이 높기 때문에, 때로는 개최권료를 거의 받지 않거나 276억 원 수준의 상대적으로 낮은 비용만 받고 대회를 개최하기도 하죠.\n싱가포르 역시 F1 하면 빼놓을 수 없는 도시입니다. 2008년부터 시작된 싱가포르 그랑프리는 도심 스트리트 서킷에서 야간에 펼쳐지는 ‘나이트 레이스’로 유명합니다. 루프탑 바나 고층 빌딩에서도 경기를 관람할 수 있어 도시 전체가 축제 분위기로 바뀌죠. 지난 10년간 이 대회를 보기 위해 싱가포르를 찾은 관광객은 약 45만 명, 이들이 쓴 돈은 약 2조 원에 달합니다. 싱가포르 정부가 매년 487억 원의 개최권료를 기꺼이 지불하는 이유가 여기에 있습니다.\n한 번 실패했던 한국,\n다시 F1에 도전할 수 있을까\n한국도 한때 F1 대회를 개최한 적이 있습니다. 2010년부터 2013년까지 전남 영암에서 열렸지만, F1에 대한 낮은 인지도, 접근성 부족, 열악한 인프라 탓에 흥행에 실패했고, 높은 개최권 비용(약 480억 원)과 수익성 악화로 2014년부터 대회 개최를 포기했습니다. 영암 F1 대회조직위원회의 발표에 따르면 2010년에는 700억 원, 2011년에는 600억 원의 적자를 기록했습니다.\n\n2012년 영암에서 펼쳐진 코리아 그랑프리에 참가한 레드불 팀 / 사진: 로이터\n그런데 최근 인천시가 다시 F1 대회 유치에 나섰습니다. 싱가포르처럼 도심 스트리트 서킷을 고려하고 있고, 이를 위해 인천시는 전체 사업비의 30%를 국비로 지원받기 위해 노력 중입니다. 인천은 국제공항과 수도권 접근성이라는 이점을 갖췄고, 무엇보다 지금은 한국에서도 F1 콘텐츠의 팬층이 꽤 형성됐다는 점에서 성공 가능성이 있어 보입니다.\nF1 대회는 지구상에서 가장 빠른 스포츠 대회입니다. 하지만 F1 대회 개최 여부에 대한 논의는 다양한 문제를 검토해야 하기 때문에 빠르게 하면 안 됩니다. 인천의 F1 대회가 싱가포르 대회와 같은 성공을 거두려면 더더욱 그렇죠. 싱가포르도 F1 대회 유치를 결정하기까지 5~6년 동안 면밀한 검토를 했습니다.\n과연 한 차례 실패를 경험했던 한국에서 F1 대회는 성공할 수 있을까요?\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Graphic 이은호 이제현",
