However, with GitHub Copilot agents, developers can now delegate these complex editing tasks to the agent, which understands your intent and can carry out codebase-wide edits, reducing the manual effort required to perform these refactors.\nTo make this experience even more powerful for C++ developers, we’re introducing C++ Code Editing Tools for GitHub Copilot, now available in Private Preview in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders.\nThese tools bring the power of C++ IntelliSense to Visual Studio agent mode, enabling faster and more accurate codebase-wide edits. With these tools, GitHub Copilot can now access rich context for any C++ symbol, including:\nViewing all references across your codebase\nUnderstanding relevant metadata (e.g. type, declaration, and scope)\nVisualizing class inheritance hierarchies\nTracing function call chains\n\nBy grounding edits in semantic understanding rather than syntactic-level text matching, these tools help reduce the manual effort required for refactors.\n\nTo see these tools in action, please watch our demo below\n\nYou can invoke these tools directly in Copilot Chat and use prompt files for more complex refactoring tasks. For best results, we recommend that you be clear and specific with your prompts and break larger ideas into smaller, fine-grained tasks for the agent to execute.\nWant to try it out?\nThese tools are now available in Private Preview as we work to shape the user experience and gather feedback from our C++ developers.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Sign up for the Private Preview waitlist\n\nA few problems have reared their heads at every company where I’ve worked on C++ as a Software Engineer over the past 20 years. For the most part, those problems have nothing to do with the language and how it is used, but instead all the “other” stuff, like dealing with long build times, getting consistent build environments, and managing the technical debt of an evolving tooling landscape.\nWhen the tools we use to build our applications and systems have new releases, we must make hard decisions. Do we adopt the latest and greatest and turn potential technical debt into realized technical debt, or do we err on the side of the stability of our systems, perhaps at the cost of critical performance or security improvements? A reasonable approach is to weigh the benefits we will gain against the costs of dealing with different codegen, stricter language conformance, and deprecated or removed features.\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++, available in Private Preview in the latest version of Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, tips the scale, greatly reducing the toil incurred when adopting newer versions of MSVC. Let GitHub Copilot churn through that technical debt while you focus on adding that great new feature or finding and resolving the root cause of that bug found by your most important customer.\n\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ can launch the upgrade process, analyze the project for any warnings or errors, create a detailed plan on how to fix those issues, and then implement those changes. Along the way, you’ll have the opportunity to direct Copilot to focus on specific issues and to adjust the plan to fit your exact situation and coding practices. You won’t need to spend hours or days tracking down all the places where that deprecated API is used and manually applying the same pattern to adopt its replacement. And you won’t need to stare at your screen trying to decide which of the hundreds of new warnings should be the first that you should tackle; Copilot may even resolve them all before you’ve had time to understand the work and decide where to start.\nWant to try it out?\nGitHub Copilot app modernization for C++ is now available in Private Preview so that we can gather feedback from users with real world C++ codebases. If you want to help others, including your future self, by helping us make the experience as awesome as possible, please join our Private Preview waitlist. And in the meantime, go ahead and get started with the latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders build!\n \nThe post Fix build issues using GitHub Copilot after upgrading MSVC Build Tools appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Get ready to level up your C++ productivity, because Visual Studio 2026 version 18.0 is now generally available! You can take advantage of the new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements in your production environment. This post describes what’s new for C++ developers, including new features or improvements in these areas:\nA refreshed IDE UI\nSupport for Visual Studio 2022 extensions out of the box\nSeamless upgrade experience from an older version of Visual Studio\nMicrosoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50: Greater C++23 conformance and runtime performance improvements\nAddressSanitizer support for ARM64 targets (Preview)\nIDE productivity improvements:\n\nNew keyboard shortcuts\nSyntax highlighting for C++ attributes\nClass View substring searches and performance improvements\nGenerate preprocessed output\nEnhanced controls in the bottom margin, including viewing and setting file encoding\nFile exclusion options in Quick Find and Find in Files\nGitHub Copilot Chat: improved chat experience and new context menu options\nC++ project system changes (MSBuild and CMake)\nNew clang-tidy configuration options\nSet command line arguments for the debugger from the toolbar\nMermaid chart rendering\nPodman support in Container Tools\nGit tools improvements\nYou can also read the broader announcement on the Visual Studio Blog for more details on changes that are non-C++-specific. Let’s dive in!\nYour feedback matters to us\nYou can always give us feedback about your Visual Studio experience on Visual Studio Developer Community or from the Help > Send Feedback menu in the IDE.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we fixed 387 C++ related issues and implemented 29 C++ related feature requests in Visual Studio. Many of the new features described in this blog post were suggested by you!\nRefreshed UI with 11 themes to choose from\nUser Feedback: Update UI of Visual Studio 2022 like the new Windows 11 UI – Developer Community\nThe new IDE includes a UI refresh, from icon and spacing changes to 11 new themes.\n\nImproved settings UI\nUser Feedback: Unified Settings feedback – Developer Community\nThe Visual Studio settings (Tools > Options) UI is now integrated into the editor. You can also configure the settings from a JSON file accessible from the new UI.\n\nYour settings will carry forward from older Visual Studio versions with roaming support. However, settings will no longer sync back to older products to ensure a cleaner migration path and forward compatibility.\nBring your Visual Studio 2022 extensions\n\nVisual Studio 2026 works out of the box with your existing Visual Studio 2022 extensions.\nUpgrading existing projects to Visual Studio 2026\nCheck out our blog post, Upgrading C++ Projects to Visual Studio 2026, for an overview of what’s available to you to help you manage your transition to Visual Studio 2026, including continued binary compatibility for the C++ build tools and redistributable and the new Visual Studio setup assistant. Then, take a look at our updated porting and upgrading guide in our documentation.\nMicrosoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.50\nVersion 18.0 of the IDE ships with Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools version 14.50, offering our best conformance, build performance, and runtime performance story yet, along with a multitude of bug fixes. To get access to all the new language features, be sure to build with /std:c++latest or go with /std:c++23preview if you only need features up to and including C++23.\nC++ language improvements in the compiler\nC++23 language updates in the compiler are summarized in the C++ Language Updates in MSVC Build Tools v14.50 blog post. They include, but are not limited to:\nP0849R8: auto(x): decay-copy in the language, for casting x into a prvalue as if passing it as a function argument by value.\nP2437R1: Implemented C++23 preprocessing directive #warning to allow code authors to generate a diagnostic message without stopping translation the way #error does.\nCWG Issue 2586: Explicit object parameter for assignment and comparison.\nP2280R4: Using unknown pointers and references in constant expressions.\nC++ language features and performance improvements in the standard library\nMicrosoft C++ standard library (STL) changes are summarized at: Changelog · microsoft/STL Wiki. As this is an open-source project, we welcome community contributions. With the help of the community, we implemented many improvements, including, but not limited to:\nP0472R3: Put monostate in <utility>.\nP3223R2: Making std::istream::ignore(n, delim) less surprising. This had surprising behavior if delim is a char with a negative value. This change removes the surprise to make code more robust.\nPartial support for P3697R1: minor additions to standard library hardening to improve memory safety.\nLWG-2503: multiline option should be added to syntax_option_type.\nLWG-4186: regex_traits::transform_primary mistakenly detects typeid of a function.\nLWG-4222: expected constructor from a single value missing a constraint.\nLWG-4242: ranges::distance does not work with volatile iterators.\nA multitude of performance improvements (see changelog for more):\n\nImproved performance for regex matching.\nStarted using [[msvc::no_unique_address]] as a space optimization in several C++23 components.\nAdded and improved vectorized implementations of many types and functions.\nUsed Clang’s builtin __is_trivially_equality_comparable to improve the performance of equal(), ranges::equal, and many vectorized algorithms for more types.\nImplemented an exponential speedup for minstd_rand and minstd_rand0's discard() member function\nImproved std::includes() to have the same performance as ranges::includes\nImproved the performance of count() for vector<bool>\nCompiler runtime performance improvements\nWorking closely with our game developer partners, we invested in runtime performance improvements for code built with MSVC. We measured these improvements using benchmarks from Unreal Engine City Sample (RenderThread and GameThread):\nUp to +6% faster runtime, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample RenderThread\n\nUp to +3% faster runtime, as measured on Unreal Engine’s City Sample GameThread\n\nAddressSanitizer support for ARM64 builds (Preview)\nIn Visual Studio 2019 we added AddressSanitizer support for code built with MSVC to help developers identify memory safety issues with zero false positives using the /fsanitize=address flag. At the time, the support applied to code built for x86 and x64 architectures. This support is now extended to projects targeting ARM64. This ARM64 support is in preview, and we will continue to refine it and fix any incoming bugs in future updates.\nIDE productivity improvements\nWe worked on several developer productivity improvements in 18.0, many in response to feedback from you!\nMore keyboard shortcut consistency with other editors\nUser Feedback: Adding a shortcut Ctrl+W to close the file in VS – Developer Community\nSeveral keyboard shortcuts have been added from VS Code and other editors to give you a more consistent experience as you switch between these environments. In the past, this included Ctrl + / to toggle line comments and Ctrl + Shift + P to open Feature Search. But the following shortcuts are new in 18.0:\nCtrl + W now closes the current tab (in addition to Ctrl + F4)\nCtrl + P now opens Code Search (in addition to Ctrl + T and Ctrl + ,)\nSyntax highlighting for C++ attributes\nUser Feedback: Syntax highlighting: use a unique color for C++ attributes – Developer Community\nC++ attributes are now colored in the editor, making your code more visually distinctive and easier to read. By default, they use the same theme color as user-defined types.\n\nClass View substring searches and performance improvements\nUser Feedback: Search in Class View does not work, if search term is not the beginning of the class but part of it – Developer Community\nThe Class View window now supports substring searches, so you can have an easier time examining the architecture of your code.\n\nIn addition, Class View’s performance has been improved for Unreal Engine projects.\nGenerate preprocessed output\nUser Feedback: Make it possible to see preprocessed C++ source code (easily in IDE) – Developer Community\nYou can right-click a C++ file in Solution Explorer and select Preprocess to instantly generate its preprocessed output, making it easy to debug macros and includes, see errors immediately, and avoid manual changes to project settings or interruptions to full project builds.\n\nEnhanced controls in the bottom margin\nUser Feedback: I wish Visual Studio 2022 able to show file encoding in the editor. – Developer Community\nThe bottom margin in the editor has been upgraded to be more informative and customizable. Line, column, and character position are now unified into a single display. Clicking it opens the Go To Line dialog for faster navigation. When working with multiple selections, you’ll see total counts for selections, characters, and lines. Hovering over the selection margin reveals detailed info per selection.\n\nFile encoding is now displayed in the margin for quick reference. You can also save or reopen a file using a specific encoding, which helps ensure proper display of special characters, supports multiple languages, and maintains consistent readability across systems.\nClicking the encoding margin opens a context menu where you can choose to save or reopen the file. Selecting an option will launch an encoding dialog with a dropdown list of available encodings to choose from.\n\nA new context menu has been added to the margin, giving you full control over what information is shown. This menu includes all the bottom margins in the editor, from the zoom control all the way to the new encoding margin.\n\nYou can manage these settings through Tools > Options > Text Editor > General > Display > Show editing context in the editor. For quicker adjustments, right-click the bottom margin to open the new context menu and change what’s shown.\nFile exclusions in Find in Files / Quick Find\nUser Feedback: Find and Replace — option to exclude folders – Developer Community\nYou can now exclude files you never need to look at from Find in Files (Ctrl + Shift + F) and Quick Find (Ctrl + F). To set it up, go to Tools > Options > Environment > Search, and look for the new Exclude files from search results section. There, you can add, edit, or remove glob patterns to control exactly which files are left out of your search results.\n\nGitHub Copilot Chat\nGitHub Copilot Chat allows you to use natural language to get answers to questions (Ask mode) or even implement changes for you automatically (Agent Mode). We made several improvements to this feature (listed below), and we also have 3 new features available in Private Preview: New GitHub Copilot capabilities for C++ developers: Upgrade MSVC, improve build performance, and refactor C++ code.\nBetter responses in Copilot Chat\nUser Feedback: Visual Studio GitHub Copilot line number difference – Developer Community\nCopilot Chat is getting smarter with improved context for your everyday tasks. You can expect better results when searching your codebase and referencing specific lines in your code.\nCopilot Actions in context menu\nUser Feedback: Quickly Get Copilot Assistance from Your Context Menu – Developer Community\nA Copilot Actions option was added to the right-click context menu in the Visual Studio editor.\n\nYou can use this to interact with a specific file or lines of code in Copilot Chat. You can ask Copilot to explain what the code does, make optimizations, generate comments or unit tests, or just reference it in the chat for you to add your own custom prompt.\nReference commits and changes in the Git Changes window\nYou can now ask Copilot to summarize uncommitted code changes, explain a specific commit, and more.\n\nYou can reference uncommitted changes by adding #changes to your prompt or type #commit: to pull up a list of the most recent commits for you to select. You can also reference a specific commit id.\n\nWith the context of your changes or commits, you can then ask Copilot to answer questions in Ask Mode or perform tasks in Agent Mode like writing unit tests or finding bugs.\nReference URLs in your questions\nYou can paste a URL in the prompt box and Copilot will pull information from the web to prepare its response. For example, you can ask Copilot to write a readme file based on best practices from GitHub or to look at reference material while preparing an answer to a question.\n\nThis only works for public URLs and static HTML content.\nC++ Project Systems\nVisual Studio 2026 continues to maintain native support for MSBuild, CMake, and Unreal Engine projects.\nC++20 default for new MSBuild projects\nMany MSBuild projects generated using new project templates now target C++20 by default. This includes the Console App, Windows Desktop Application, Dynamic-Link Library, and Static Library.\nCMake projects in Visual Studio 2026\nVisual Studio 2026 now includes CMake 4.1.1 by default. CMake also includes a Visual Studio 2026 generator and modern SLNX projects, allowing you to build Visual Studio C++ projects directly from CMake.\nDiagnostic Tools now support CMake projects\nCMake projects now have native support for profiling tools including CPU Usage, Events Viewer, memory usage, and File IO tools in Visual Studio. The CPU Usage tool also includes Copilot-powered performance insights, helping you detect and resolve bottlenecks even faster.\n\nTailored for game developers and performance-critical workflows, this update lets you:\nIdentify performance bottlenecks and optimize compute-heavy code with the CPU Usage Tool.\nTrack runtime events like exceptions, logs, and HTTP requests with the Events Viewer.\nAnalyze file access patterns, durations, and throughput with the File IO Tool.\nClang-tidy updates\nUser Feedback:\nclang-tidy needs to use all cores available. – Developer Community\nSupport extra args for clang-tidy – Developer Community\nThe clang-tidy code analysis tools in Visual Studio have new configuration options. You can allocate more processors to run code analysis as part of your build, speeding up your development workflow. Plus, you can add custom arguments to the command line to invoke clang-tidy, giving you complete control over your analysis setup.\n\nYou can access these powerful new options from Project Properties > Code Analysis > Clang-Tidy.\nDebugging: Set command line arguments for any C++ projects\nThe ability to set command line arguments for the debugger from the toolbar has been expanded to include all .vcxproj, CMake, and Unreal Engine projects. The feature has also received the following improvements:\nGo directly to the underlying debugger command line argument setting for your project type.\n\nA clear indication of an empty command line argument setting that retains your ability to easily identify and locate the toolbar dropdown.\n\nThis feature is no longer tied to the Game Development with C++ workload and is available to all C++ developers without needing to install any additional workloads or components.\nTo learn more, take a look at the Pass command-line arguments documentation.\nMermaid chart rendering\nUser Feedback: Mermaid support and code highlighting in markdown previews – Developer Community\nYou can now render Mermaid charts in the markdown editor preview window, where you can provide your own Mermaid syntax or generate it with Copilot. This lets you visualize complex data structures and workflows in the IDE.\n\nPodman support in Container Tools\nVisual Studio Container Tools now support Podman, a popular container management tool that provides a daemonless container engine. This allows you to run and manage containers using the Podman CLI directly from Visual Studio.\n\nTo get started, simply start Podman and open your solution in Visual Studio.\nGit tools\nThe Visual Studio Git tools also received some updates:\nCopilot-generated code reviews now use updated reasoning models to provide more insightful and precise comments.\nCode review comments are now generated for the entire change set at once rather than file-by-file, resulting in improved performance and a more comprehensive review.\nWhen you view Copilot generated comments on your uncommitted changes, you will now see a list of comments in the Git Changes window. You can double click a comment to navigate to that line of code in the editor.\nYou can apply suggested code changes from a PR comment by clicking the sparkle button at the top right of the comment. If there aren’t any suggestions, you can request Copilot to suggest a change based on the comment.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026\nReady to get started?

        "content:encodedSnippet": "StyleX is Meta’s styling system for large-scale applications. It combines the ergonomics of CSS-in-JS with the performance of static CSS, generating collision-free atomic CSS while allowing for expressive, type-safe style authoring. StyleX was open sourced at the end of 2023 and has since become the standard styling system across Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads, as well as external companies like Figma and Snowflake.\nAt its core, StyleX is a compiler that extracts styles at build time and generates a static stylesheet. But it’s also a philosophy: a framework for authoring, sharing, and maintaining CSS at scale. StyleX makes styling intuitive for everyday engineers by imposing constraints that encourage predictability, enable composition, and scale effortlessly across teams and codebases.\nHow Do We Build CSS at Scale?\nTo understand the purpose of StyleX, let’s look at the history of CSS at Meta. Serving CSS at such a scale resulted in collisions across bundles, difficulties in managing dependencies between stylesheets, and challenges in reconciling competing rules that frequently led to specificity wars. Engineers resorted to complex selectors and !important tags, making styles brittle and hard to maintain. Large, monolithic CSS bundles meant browsers were downloading hundreds of kilobytes of unused rules on every page load, slowing rendering and interaction. \nTo address these issues, Facebook built cx, a CSS-modules-like system that linked local CSS to JavaScript. cx resolved issues with namespace collisions and dependency management but remained limited to static styles defined in separate files.\n// ComponentName.css; class uses ComponentName/namespace syntax\r\n.ComponentName/header { margin-top: 10px }\r\n\r\n// ComponentName.js \r\n<div className={cx('ComponentName/header')} />\nWhen we rebuilt Facebook.com from the ground up, we had the opportunity to build something better. Around this time, the CSS-in-JS movement was gaining momentum. Developers increasingly wanted to colocate styles with component code, write dynamic styles based on runtime state, and leverage JavaScript paradigms like import graphs, module scoping, and type systems. But early CSS-in-JS systems relied on runtime injection: dynamically generating <style> tags and mutating the DOM during render, patterns that introduced measurable performance overhead.\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { margin: 10 }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({}) {\r\n  return <div {...styles.props(styles.foo)}/>\r\n}\r\n\nWe built on the lessons of this movement and made a system that is CSS-in-JS only in form, with styles compiling to static CSS. StyleX soon replaced our precursor cx system and transformed the way we approached styling. With StyleX, styles were now defined in JavaScript, enabling composition, conditional logic, and build-time compilation. Atomic classes reduced CSS size by 80% and made styling maintainable across a rapidly scaling codebase.\nToday, StyleX is the default styling system at Meta, powering everything from product surfaces to component libraries. Engineers use it to build interfaces that are expressive, reusable, and performant.\nInto the Compiler\nThe power of StyleX lies in its abstraction. We automatically handle CSS specificity, variable generation, and static compilation to generate predictable, collision-free atomic CSS. This avoids the maintenance overload of hand-authored CSS styles, allowing users to focus on style authoring. \nStyleX lives in a monorepo composed of several integrated packages. The core engine is a Babel plugin that runs a transform across a project and returns the extracted CSS. At a high level, the compiler traverses a set of files, extracts CSS metadata from style objects, and converts style declarations to atomic CSS classes. The collected metadata is then run through several processes: value normalization, at-rules wrapping, and legacy polyfills. Finally, the CSS rules are sorted and outputted into a static sheet.\n\nLet’s explore the behind-the-scenes of this process through the values of StyleX. \nScalability\nAt the heart of StyleX is its static compilation into atomic CSS. Styles are converted to classes containing a single style declaration for reuse across a codebase so CSS size plateaus as the application grows. Whenever possible, styles are compiled away and cached per file, so the system can analyze all reachable styles, deduplicate shared declarations, and emit only what’s needed at runtime.\nThe core API surface is intentionally lightweight:\nstylex.create() is used to define style objects. Objects are stripped away at build time and converted to atomic CSS. Each property: value pair is hashed and outputted as a CSS class. This API is designed for cacheability and only allows for statically resolvable values. \nstylex.props() handles merging and deduping of style objects. Each call is transpiled to an object containing a space-separated className string corresponding to each atomic style, and a style prop for dynamic styles. When styles are local to the module, we compile at build time; when styles are used across module boundaries, we defer to a tiny runtime merge.\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { margin: 10 }\r\n  bar: { margin: 10, color: 'red' }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({style}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n     <div {...styles.props(styles.foo)}/> \r\n     <div {...styles.props(styles.bar)}/> \r\n     <div {...stylex.props(style)}/> \r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\nIn each JavaScript file, API calls are replaced with the class names from the generated CSS and local styles are stripped away. The above component compiles to something like this:\nimport * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent({style}) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n     <div className=\"m-10\" />\r\n     <div className=\"c-red m-10\" /> \r\n     <div {...stylex.props(style)}/> \r\n    </>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\nAfter the transform is run across files, we process the collected metadata, generate LTR/RTL variants, resolve constants, and order CSS rules by priority. The output is a string that can be emitted as a static stylesheet and post-processed by any of our bundlers.\n.m-10 { margin: 10px }\r\n.c-red { color: red }\r\n\nExpressiveness\nStyleX enforces constraints as design principles instead of limitations. We disallow conflict-prone patterns like styling at a distance and enforce patterns that are statically resolvable. Within these boundaries, however, StyleX remains expressive. We’ve designed for maximum flexibility within these constraints through the following APIs.\nShareable Values\nstylex.create()is designed for per-file cacheability: all CSS metadata must be derived solely from the JavaScript defined within that file. We use an extended version of Babel’s evaluate function to resolve values. The compiler never needs to read the contents of imported modules to generate the stylesheet. \nTo enable reusable values across files, we provide APIs like stylex.defineVars() and stylex.defineConsts(). These functions generate deterministic hashes based on variable name and import path that remain consistent across modules. This allows us to resolve variables anywhere they’re imported without traversing the file that declares them. At build time, shared constants are fully inlined, while shared variables become global CSS custom properties that can be referenced across components.\n// varsFile.stylex.js\r\nconst varColors = stylex.defineVars({primary: \"#eee\"})\r\n// constsFile.stylex.js\r\nconst constColors = stylex.defineConsts({primary: \"#fff\"})\r\n\r\n// Component.react.js\r\nimport {varColors} from 'varsFile.stylex.js' \r\nimport {constColors} from 'constsFile.stylex.js' \r\n\r\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    foo: {color: varColors.primary} // → .x { var(--hash('varsFile.varColors.primary')) }\r\n    bar: {color: constColors.primary} // → hash('constsFile.constColors.primary') → #fff\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, StyleX is a system for styling components. Elements are styled using classnames. Global and complex selectors are disallowed to avoid styling at a distance: rules that affect elements indirectly from elsewhere in the DOM. Global baseline rules like element selectors or CSS resets must be defined in a separate stylesheet. This is to minimize indirect styling and promote encapsulation of styles.\n/* Unsafe: styles leak to child elements rather than being explicitly applied */\r\n.csuifyiu:hover > div { ... }\r\n\r\n/* Safe: styles are scoped to a specific element based on observed state */\r\ndiv:hover > .ksghfhjsfg { ... } \nHowever, we do allow observing from a distance using the stylex.when APIs. This API provides a suite of relational selectors to style a component based on the state of its ancestors, descendants, or siblings. Observed elements must be marked with stylex.defaultMarker(), ensuring styles remain directly applied while supporting contextual behavior.\nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    foo: {\r\n      backgroundColor: {\r\n        default: 'blue',\r\n        [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover')]: 'red',\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\n<div {...stylex.props(stylex.defaultMarker())}>\r\n  <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo)}> Some Content </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\nPreserving CSS Features\nStyleX preserves most of the CSS feature set (media queries, pseudoclasses, keyframes, and more) through static transforms at build time. Wherever possible, we mirror native CSS behavior so styling feels expansive and familiar.\nWhile StyleX is built around static compilation, it also supports dynamic styles. When a value isn’t known at build time, the compiler emits a CSS variable reference, and the runtime writes it inline through the style prop. \nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n    // Height is unknown until runtime\r\n    foo: (height) => ({\r\n      height,\r\n    }),\r\n});\r\n\r\n// { .d-height {var(--height)}, style: {--height: height} }\r\n<div {...stylex.props(styles.foo(height))}/> \r\n\nTheming APIs like stylex.defineVars() and stylex.createTheme() allow users to create and mutate shareable design tokens. defineVars() creates a variable grouping, and createTheme() allows users to create variants by redefining variable groups at a higher specificity.\n/* const spacing = stylex.defineVars({sm: 2px, md: 4px, lg: 8px}) */\r\n:root, .sp-group{--sp-sm:2px;--sp-md:4px;--sp-lg:8px;}\r\n\r\n/* const desktopSpacing = stylex.createTheme(spacing, {sm: 5px, md: 10px, lg: 20px}) */\r\n.sp-dktp.sp-dktp, .sp-dktp.sp-dktp:root{--sp-sm:5px;--sp-md:10px;--sp-lg:20px;}\r\n\nstylex.defineConsts() allows users to define shareable constants and media queries without overloading browser memory with CSS variables. During compilation, StyleX gathers metadata across all defineConsts() calls, generates placeholder hashes in  create() calls, and inlines the constant values directly into the generated stylesheet.\nFinally, APIs like stylex.keyframes() and stylex.viewTransitionClass() support animations by generating @keyframes and ::view-transition-* rules.\nPredictability\nStyleX is a system for styling components. We discourage global styling in favour of applying localized classnames on elements directly. Our design is centered around predictable style merging: The last style always wins! You can think of the stylex.props function as a deterministic merge of style objects: given stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar), bar always overrides foo. This makes it easy to share and combine styles predictably across files.\nCSS specificity follows a hierarchy where selectors are assigned different priorities. The calculation is based on a three-column value of IDs, classes, and types, commonly written as, (ID, Class, Type). Because StyleX is entirely class-based, resolving conflicts between style objects means determining which class names to apply and enforcing priorities between them. \nconst styles = stylex.create({\r\n  foo: { color: 'red', margin: 0 }\r\n  bar: { color: 'black', marginTop: 10 }\t\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction MyComponent() {\r\n  // becomes <div className=\"c-black m-0 mt-10\" /> \r\n  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar)} /> \r\n}\r\n\nDuring merge, repeated properties across style objects are deduplicated so that only the last value is applied. As a result, each class name in the DOM node corresponds to a single property. In the above example, the color: red class is dropped during merge so color: black takes precedence. But resolving overlaps between shorthands and constituent longhands is more complex. \nConsider the following HTML:\n<style>\r\n  .margin-top-10 { margin-top: 10px }\r\n  .margin-0 { margin: 0px }\r\n<style/>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"margin-0 margin-top-10\" />\r\n\nWhen multiple classes are applied on a div, the resulting styling is based solely on the specificity of the selectors (in this case, the order of the classes). Without additional handling, margin overrides margin-top here completely! \nThrow pseudoclasses and media queries in the mix and things become even more complex:\n{\r\n   [ \"m-0\", { \"css\": \".m-10 {margin: 0}\" }, 3000 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10\", { \"css\": \".mt-10 {margin-top: 10px}\", }, 4000 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10-mq\", { \"css\": \"@media (...) {.mt-10-mq {margin-top: 10px} }\", }, 4200 ], \r\n   [ \"mt-10-mq\", { \"css\": \"@media (...) {.mt-10-mq:hover {margin-top: 10px} }\", }, 4320 ], \r\n}\r\n\nTo handle this ambiguity, we compute a numerical priority alongside each CSS rule. We use these priorities alongside a user-configured styleResolution to determine the specificity of each class selector using the @layer at-rule or equivalent polyfill. \nThe enforced ordering looks something like this: \n\nThe result? Longhands and shorthands merge predictably, :active states override :hover states, media queries override default behaviour, and user-authored order is respected when possible. This behind-the-scenes specificity handling allows developers to combine and reuse styles without manually resolving conflicts.\nLooking Forward\nStyleX is maintained by a team of CSS enthusiasts who aim to make styling accessible to everyone. Beyond the compiler, the monorepo includes an ESLint plugin for style validation, a CLI for easy stylesheet generation, a PostCSS plugin for post-processing, and an experimental CSS parser. \nThe open source community has played an important role in shaping the direction of StyleX, and been a massive force multiplier in our work. We continue to learn, grow, and ideate in collaboration with the companies and individuals adopting our work. Today, with the help of thousands of contributors, the ecosystem includes a community-built playground, VS Code extensions, an SWC compiler, multiple bundler integrations, and more!\nWe’re always exploring new ways to make StyleX the styling system for the modern web. Our work is an ongoing dialogue between the needs of the community and the values that guide our design. Roadmap highlights include an API for shareable functions, LLM-ready context files, support for inline styles, developer extensions, strict compiler validation, logical styles utilities, and an official unplugin for bundler integrations. Our goal is to continue to evolve alongside the browser and keep imagining what styling on the web can be.\nHappy style authoring!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details about Meta’s Generative Ads Recommendation Model (GEM), a new foundation model that delivers increased ad performance and advertiser ROI by enhancing other ads recommendation models’ ability to serve relevant ads.\nGEM’s novel architecture allows it to scale with an increasing number of parameters while consistently generating more precise predictions efficiently.\nGEM propagates its learnings, leveraging a suite of post-training techniques across the entire ads model fleet, enabling a paradigm shift in Meta’s Ads Recommendation system.\nGEM leverages enhanced training scalability that efficiently utilizes thousands of GPUs for building and iterating an LLM-scale ads foundation model.\nGEM is already driving significant increases in ad conversions across Instagram and Facebook.\nMeta has been at the forefront of harnessing AI across our products and services to drive business value for advertisers. Leveraging advanced techniques to personalize ads for people and maximize the performance of each ad impression is an integral part of how we develop our Ads Recommendation system. \nThe Generative Ads Recommendation Model (GEM) is Meta’s most advanced ads foundation model, built on an LLM-inspired paradigm and trained across thousands of GPUs.  It is the largest foundation model for recommendation systems (RecSys) in the industry, trained at the scale of large language models. GEM introduces architectural innovations that unlock efficient scaling laws, delivering performance gains that scale cost-effectively with data and compute. Training breakthroughs such as multi-dimensional parallelism, custom GPU kernels, and memory optimizations make it feasible to train GEM at its scale. Post-training, GEM applies advanced knowledge transfer techniques to amplify the performance of downstream models across the entire ads stack, delivering more relevant and personalized ad experiences aligned with people’s preferences. Since launching GEM earlier this year, GEM’s launch across Facebook and Instagram has delivered a 5% increase in ad conversions on Instagram and a 3% increase in ad conversions on Facebook Feed in Q2. \nIn Q3, we made improvements to GEM’s model architecture that doubled the performance benefit we get from adding a given amount of data and compute. This will enable us to continue scaling up the amount of training capacity we use on GEM at an attractive ROI.\nIntroducing GEM\nGEM represents a significant advancement in RecSys through three key innovations: model scaling with advanced architecture, post-training techniques for knowledge transfer, and enhanced training infrastructure to support scalability. These innovations efficiently boost ad performance, enable effective knowledge sharing across the ad model fleet, and optimize the use of thousands of GPUs for training. GEM has driven a paradigm shift in ads RecSys, transforming ad performance across the funnel — awareness, engagement, and conversion — through joint optimization of both user and advertiser objectives.\nBuilding a large foundation model for Meta’s ads RecSys requires addressing several key challenges:\nHandling a large, dynamic feature space across all of Meta’s apps: Every day, billions of user-ad interactions occur across our platforms, but meaningful signals — such as clicks and conversions — are very sparse. GEM must learn from this vast but imbalanced data, recognizing meaningful patterns and generalizing across diverse users and behaviors.\nProcessing a diverse array of data: GEM must learn from a diverse array of ads data — including advertiser goals, creative formats, measurement signals, and user behaviors across multiple delivery channels. This heterogeneity adds significant modeling complexity, requiring GEM to unify multimodal, multi-source inputs and capture nuanced interactions to power other ads recommendation models.\nTraining efficiently: Training and scaling a large foundation model demands thousands of GPUs and leveraging advanced parallelism and system-level optimization to ensure efficient hardware utilization. \nGEM overcomes these challenges through:\n A scalable model architecture that is now 4x more efficient at driving ad performance gains for a given amount of data and compute than our original ads recommendation ranking models. \nA new framework that improves knowledge transfer effectiveness, achieving 2x the effectiveness of standard knowledge distillation.\nA new training stack that delivers a 23x increase in effective training FLOPS with a 1.43x increase in model FLOPS utilization (MFU) using 16x more GPUs. \nBuilding and Scaling GEM’s Architecture\nGEM is trained on ad content and user engagement data from both ads and organic interactions. From this data, we derive features that we categorize into two groups: sequence features (such as activity history) and non-sequence features (such as user and ad attributes — e.g., age, location, ad format, and creative representation). Customized attention mechanisms are applied to each group independently, while also enabling cross-feature learning. This design improves accuracy and scales both the depth and breadth of each attention block, delivering 4× the efficiency of our previous generation of models.\n\nNon-Sequence Feature Interaction Modeling\nUnderstanding how user attributes interact with ad characteristics is crucial for accurate recommendations. GEM enhances the Wukong architecture to use stackable factorization machines with cross-layer attention connections, allowing the model to learn which feature combinations matter most. Each Wukong block can scale vertically (for deeper interactions) and horizontally (for broader feature coverage), enabling the discovery of increasingly complex user-ad patterns.\nOffline Sequence Feature Modeling\nUser behavior sequences — spanning long sequences of ad / content clicks, views, and interactions — contain rich signals about preferences and intent, yet traditional architectures struggle to process such long sequences efficiently. GEM overcomes this challenge with a pyramid-parallel structure, stacking multiple parallel interaction modules in a pyramid formation to capture complex user-ad relationships at scale. The new scalable offline feature infrastructure processes sequences of up to thousands of events with minimal storage cost, so GEM can learn from a much longer history of user organic and ad interactions. By modeling these extended user behavior sequences, GEM can more effectively uncover patterns and relationships, resulting in a deeper and more accurate understanding of the user’s purchase journey.\nCross-Feature Learning\nExisting approaches compress user behavior sequences into compact vectors for downstream tasks, which risks losing critical engagement signals. GEM takes a different approach that preserves full sequence information while enabling efficient cross-feature learning. Our design, InterFormer, employs parallel summarization with an interleaving structure that alternates between sequence learning (e.g., custom transformer architecture) and cross-feature interaction layers. This allows progressively refining its sequence understanding while maintaining access to the complete user journey. This design facilitates efficient interaction learning while preserving the structural integrity of user sequence data — enabling GEM to scale to higher layer counts without losing critical behavioral signals.\nMulti-Domain Learning With Domain-Specific Optimization\nTraditional ad recommendation systems struggle to balance learning across a broad product ecosystem — treating surfaces either in isolation (thus missing valuable cross-platform insights) or identically (ignoring platform-specific behaviors). Different Meta surfaces like Facebook, Instagram, and Business Messaging each have unique user behaviors and interaction patterns. GEM solves this through learning from cross-surface user interactions while ensuring predictions remain tailored to each surface’s unique characteristics. For example, this enables GEM to use insights from Instagram video ad engagement to improve Facebook Feed ad predictions, while also optimizing each domain’s predictions for its specific objective (such as clicks or conversions).\nMaximizing Transfer Efficiency With Post Training Techniques\nGEM only delivers impact if its knowledge can be efficiently transferred to hundreds of user-facing vertical models (VMs). To translate the performance of the GEM foundation model (FM) into measurable gains for user-facing VMs, we employ both direct and hierarchical knowledge transfer strategies. \nDirect transfer enables GEM to transfer knowledge to major VMs within the same data spaces where GEM was trained. Hierarchical transfer distills knowledge from GEM into domain-specific FMs, which then teach VMs, driving broad improvements across ad models. Together, these approaches use a suite of techniques, including knowledge distillation, representation learning, and parameter sharing to maximize transfer efficiency across the entire ad model space, achieving 2x the effectiveness of standard knowledge distillation.\n\nKnowledge Distillation\nIn Meta’s ads system, VMs often suffer from stale supervision caused by delays in FM training and evaluation as well as domain mismatches between GEM or FM predictions and the VMs’ surface-specific objectives. These outdated or misaligned signals between the VMs (students) and GEM (the teacher) can degrade the accuracy and adaptability of student models over time.\nTo address this, we use a Student Adapter during training, a lightweight component that refines the teacher’s outputs using the most recent ground-truth data. It learns a transformation that better aligns teacher predictions with observed outcomes, ensuring that student models receive more up-to-date and domain-relevant supervision throughout training.\nRepresentation Learning\nRepresentation learning is the process by which models automatically drive meaningful and compact features from raw data, enabling more effective downstream tasks like ad click prediction. Representation learning complements knowledge distillation by generating semantically aligned features that support efficient knowledge transfer from teacher to student models. With this approach GEM can effectively improve FM-to-VM transfer efficiency without adding inference overhead.\nParameter Sharing\nParameter sharing is a technique in which multiple models or components reuse the same set of parameters to reduce redundancy, improve efficiency, and facilitate knowledge transfer.\nIn our context, parameter sharing enables efficient knowledge reuse by allowing VMs to selectively incorporate components from FMs. This lets smaller, latency-sensitive VMs leverage the rich representations and pre-learned patterns of FMs without incurring their full computational cost.\nHow GEM Was Trained\nGEM operates at a scale typically only seen by modern LLMs. Training GEM required a complete overhaul of our training recipes. The re-engineered training stack delivers a 23x increase in effective training FLOPs using 16x more GPUs while also improving efficiency. MFU, a key measure of hardware efficiency, increased by 1.43x, reflecting better use of GPU resources. This ability to increase both throughput and efficiency is important to training foundation models of this scale.\nTo support massive model sizes and multimodal workloads, we employ strategies such as multi-dimensional parallelism, custom GPU kernels, and model-system co-design. These techniques enable near-linear scaling, applied to thousands of GPUs, improving compute throughput, memory usage, and overall hardware efficiency. \nDistributed Training\nTraining large models, like GEM, requires carefully orchestrated parallelism strategies across both dense and sparse components. For the dense parts of the model, techniques like Hybrid Sharded Distributed Parallel (HSDP) optimize memory usage and reduce communication costs, enabling efficient distribution of dense parameters across thousands of GPUs. In contrast, the sparse components — primarily large embedding tables used for user and item features — employ a two-dimensional approach using data parallelism and model parallelism, optimized for synchronization efficiency and memory locality.\nSystem-Level Optimizations for GPU Throughput\nBeyond parallelism, we implemented a suite of techniques to saturate GPU compute throughput and reduce training bottlenecks:\nA custom in-house GPU kernel designed for variable-length (jagged) user sequences and computation fusion, leveraging the latest GPU hardware features and optimization techniques.\nGraph-level compilation in PyTorch 2.0 that automates key optimizations, including activation checkpointing for memory savings and operator fusion for improved execution efficiency.\nMemory compression techniques such as FP8 quantization for activations and unified embedding formats to reduce memory footprint.\nAdditionally, we developed GPU communication collectives that operate without utilizing Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) resources via NCCLX (Meta’s fork of NVIDIA’s NCCL) to eliminate contention between communication and compute workloads, improving overlap and GPU utilization.\nReducing Training Overhead and Job Startup Time\nTo improve training agility and minimize GPU idleness, we optimized effective training time (ETT) — the proportion of training time spent processing new data. We reduced job startup time by 5x through optimizing trainer init, data reader setup, checkpointing, and PyTorch 2.0 compilation time, etc. Notably we reduced PyTorch 2.0 compilation time by 7x via caching strategies. \nMaximizing GPU Efficiency Across the Development Lifecycle \nGPU efficiency is optimized across all stages of the model lifecycle — from early experimentation to large-scale training and post-training. In the exploration phase, we accelerate iteration using lightweight model variants at a much lower cost compared to full-sized models. These variants support over half of all experiments, enabling faster idea validation with minimal resource overhead. During the post-training stage, the model runs forward passes to generate knowledge, including labels and embeddings, for downstream models. Unlike in large language models, we also perform continuous online training to refresh the FMs. We enhance traffic sharing between training and post-training knowledge generation, as well as between the foundation model and downstream models, to reduce computational demand. Additionally, GPU efficiency optimization has been applied across all stages to improve end-to-end system throughput. \nThe Future of Foundation Models for Ads Recommendations\nThe future of ads recommendation systems will be defined by a deeper understanding of people’s preferences and intent, making every interaction feel personal. For advertisers, this translates into one-to-one connections at scale, driving stronger engagement and outcomes.\nLooking ahead, GEM will learn from Meta’s entire ecosystem including user interactions on organic and ads content across modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. These learnings from GEM will be extended to cover all major surfaces across Facebook and Instagram. This stronger multimodal foundation helps GEM capture nuances behind clicks, conversions, and long-term value, paving the way for a unified engagement model that can intelligently rank both organic content and ads, delivering maximum value for people and advertisers.\nWe will continue to scale GEM and train on even larger clusters by advancing its architecture and advancing training recipes on the latest AI hardware, enabling it to learn efficiently from more data with diverse modalities to deliver precise predictions. We will also evolve GEM to reason with inference-time scaling to optimize compute allocation, power intent-centric user journeys, and enable agentic, insight-driven advertiser automation that drive higher ROAS.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Yasmine Badr, John Bocharov, Shuo Chang, Laming Chen, Wenlin Chen, Wentao Duan, Xiaorui Gan, Shuo Gu, Mengyue Hang, Yuxi Hu, Yuzhen Huang, Shali Jiang, Santanu Kolay, Zhijing Li, Boyang Liu, Rocky Liu, Xi Liu, Liang Luo, GP Musumeci, Sandeep Pandey, Richard Qiu, Jason Rudy, Vibha Sinha, Matt Steiner, Musharaf Sultan, Chonglin Sun, Viral Vimawala, Ernest Wang, Xiaozhen Xia, Jackie (Jiaqi) Xu, Fan Yang, Xin Zhang, Buyun Zhang, Zhengyu Zhang, Qinghai Zhou, Song Zhou, Zhehui Zhou, Rich Zhu and the entire team behind the development and productionization of the largest foundation model in Meta’s ads recommendation system.\nThe post Meta’s Generative Ads Model (GEM): The Central Brain Accelerating Ads Recommendation AI Innovation appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Major Spring Framework releases don’t come around often – and when they do, they tend to reshape how we build applications for years to come. Spring Framework 7 is one of those releases. It simplifies many aspects of development, cleans up some long-standing pain points, and introduces features that previously required custom annotations or boilerplate-heavy workarounds.\nThe IntelliJ IDEA team has been keeping pace since the early milestones, working closely with the Spring Framework team to ensure smooth integration and reliable tooling support. We truly appreciate their collaboration, insights, and early feedback – this release wouldn’t have been possible without their help and expertise. If you’re already experimenting with Spring 7, you’ll be happy to know that IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 is ready for it out of the box.\nLet’s explore the most prominent features of Spring 7 and see how IntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 helps you make the most of it.\nREST API Versioning\nIf you’ve ever had to version an API manually, you know the pain: URL gymnastics, header verification, parsing and comparing SemVer strings, etc. Spring 7 finally introduces a built-in, first-class versioning mechanism. You can now define versions right in your mapping annotations:\n@GetMapping(path = \"/quote\", version = \"1.0+\")\n\nResponseEntity<Quote> getQuote() {\n\n        Quote result = quoteService.getRandomQuote();\n\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(result);\n\n    }\nIntelliJ IDEA detects this automatically. The IDE checks whether versioning is configured in your app, identifies whether you’re using a property or the ApiVersionConfigurer class, and even warns you if something’s off. If you forgot to enable versioning, the IDE doesn’t just underline the issue – it tells you how to fix it.\n\n\n\n\nBy default, IntelliJ IDEA suggests using property-based configuration that enables versioning through a header attribute. It’s a safe starting point, and you can tweak it later if you’re doing something fancy.\nspring.mvc.apiversion.use.header=Api-Version\nAnd yes, you can Ctrl+Click on the version in the @GetMapping annotation to jump straight to your configuration code. The IDE also checks that your version values follow standard SemVer rules. \n\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a custom version parser, IntelliJ IDEA won’t interfere.\nTesting versioned APIs\nWhen it comes to testing, you can do it in a straightforward way and keep things simple. \nmockMvc.perform(get(\"/api/quote\")\n\n                        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)\n\n                        .header(\"API-Version\", \"1.0\")\n\n                )\nOn the other hand, Spring 7 lets you configure API versioning for tests and provides a new API – apiVersion method:\n\n\n\n\nIntelliJ IDEA knows about this API and will help you to configure versioning for tests. For the header-based versioning, the code will look like this:\n@TestConfiguration\n\nstatic class QuoteControllerTestConfig implements MockMvcBuilderCustomizer {\n\n        @Override\n\n        public void customize(ConfigurableMockMvcBuilder<?> builder) {\n\n            builder.apiVersionInserter(ApiVersionInserter.useHeader(\"Api-Version\"));\n\n        }\n\n    }\nThis configuration lets you define your versioning approach in a single class, which greatly simplifies test maintenance.\nHTTP Interface Clients\nDeclarative HTTP clients have been part of Spring since version 6, but they used to require quite a bit of boilerplate code. Spring 7 makes it much simpler: one interface, one annotation, done. Versions are supported as well.\nExample:\n@HttpExchange(url = \"http://quotes.server.com:8080/api/\")\n\ninterface QuoteClient {\n\n    @GetExchange(url = \"/quote\", version = \"1.0\")\n\n    Quote fetchRandomQuote();\n\n}\nIn Spring 7, registration is very straightforward. Just add the following annotation to a @Configuration class:\n@ImportHttpServices(types = QuoteClient.class)\nAs of now, to support versioning in the HTTP Interface client, you still need to write configuration manually. We’ll improve it in the nearest IntelliJ IDEA updates.\nspring.http.serviceclient.default.apiversion.default-version=1.0.0\n\nspring.http.serviceclient.default.apiversion.insert.header=API-Version\nIntelliJ IDEA 2025.3 recognizes HTTP interfaces as beans – no more “red squiggly lines” or “cannot resolve bean” warnings. You get full autocompletion, navigation, and injection support wherever these clients are used.\n\n\n\n\nYou can also see where each client is referenced – right from the gutter icons or in the Structure tool window. It’s a small thing, but it saves time when you’re tracing through yet another microservice.\nLooking ahead, we are working on inspections that will detect unregistered clients or incorrect imports, and even help generate clients from OpenAPI specs. In short, let developers spend less time wiring HTTP clients, and more time improving the API they call.\nDynamic Bean Registration\nHere’s something new: the BeanRegistrar interface. Sometimes you need to register beans dynamically, and @Conditional annotations just don’t cut it. Spring 7 now lets you do this cleanly:\npublic class QuoteProviderRegistrar implements BeanRegistrar {\n\n    @Override\n\n    public void register(BeanRegistry registry, Environment env) {\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderDb\", QuoteProviderDb.class);\n\n        registry.registerBean(\"quoteProviderFallback\", QuoteProviderFallback.class);\n\n    }\n\n}\nIf your bean construction logic gets complex or depends on multiple factors, programmatic bean registration is a neat way to handle it. IntelliJ IDEA recognizes these beans dynamically, so you won’t see those annoying “unresolved injection” warnings anymore. You can navigate straight from the injection point right to the registrar – those familiar little green bean icons in the gutter have got you covered.\n\n\n\n\nOf course, the IDE can’t anticipate every edge case of dynamic registration – that’s where the Spring Debugger comes in. When you’re debugging a complex setup, it shows you exactly what’s injected at runtime. \nConclusion\nSpring 7 is packed with new features – from built-in resilience support and updated Jackson integration to Spring Data AOT repositories, just to name a few. \nThe IntelliJ IDEA team works hard to ensure everything runs seamlessly in your projects, so that you can stay productive and take advantage of the latest technologies. As Spring 7 adoption grows, we will continue adding features that help you focus on your code, not the framework.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Congrats to all GSoC 2025 contributors and mentors! This year’s projects have made a real impact on the Kotlin ecosystem and the contributions are already being integrated, used, and appreciated. Thank you all for your hard work!\nLet’s take a closer look at this year’s projects:\nIntelliJ Platform Gradle Plugin – Gradle Reporting and Parallel Verifications\n“GSoC was the perfect opportunity to give back to the tools I use daily and move from user to contributor because I’d already been building IntelliJ plugins myself.”\n\n            \nVictoria Chuks Alajemba\n                                                        \nProject page\nMentor: Jakub Chrzanowski (JetBrains)\nFor Victoria Alajemba, a Software Engineer from Nigeria studying in Paris, GSoC was a bridge between learning and impact.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/qodana/2025/11/what-is-bad-code/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 15:43:47 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "The phrase “bad code” gets thrown around in reviews and online forums all the time. But what does it actually mean? It’s a good example of the vague terms that occasionally make the rounds in developer circles without much to qualify them. \nWe’ve collected opinions on the subject, metrics, and code risks that you can use to discuss what “bad” quality is for your team and how to improve it. \nWhat is bad code?\nBad code is a general term that developers, project managers, and other stakeholders use as a catch-all for a range of coding problems – bugs, smells, security issues – that contribute to low readability, maintainability, and scalability. It doesn’t just refer to codebases that have issues or don’t work like they’re supposed to. \nIn different cases, bad code refers to anything not optimized for performance and maintenance, from confusing variable names to functions that loop using too much memory. \nYour code could be described as bad if it’s:\nDifficult for other people to understand during code reviews.\nHard to maintain or scale over time.\nNot written with correct styling and formatting.\nNot well documented. \nProne to bugs and breaking. \nInsecure or vulnerable to breaches.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll get into each of these points in more depth, but it’s important to acknowledge that no codebase is perfect. There will be times when license incompatibilities take priority over style changes or security vulnerabilities trump other issues. The definition of bad code is contextual and changes depending on its surroundings. That said, there are some general red flags that can signal bad code. Let’s look at some of the most important ones. \nAndrei Petrov, DevOps Engineer in Qodana Cloud\nSimple is beautiful. Everything that is not simple and looks clever is “bad” for me. I want to cite Edsger W. Dijkstra on this: Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability. If it is not simple it is not reliable.\nHard to read or understand\nWhether someone is peer reviewing your code or making changes, they have to know what everything means. Using variable names like x1, yz, or data can make your codebase hard to decipher. Likewise, a file called xyzService, which uses mixed indentation styles and has all of its work inside a 500-line function called doStuff, is hard to read and challenging to work with.\nDifficult to maintain\nWhen code is hard to understand, it’s also hard to maintain. For example, if you have one function that handles web requests, database logic, and data formatting, any tiny change to the code risks breaking it. Additionally, poorly written legacy codebases can lead to high technical debt when code needs to be refactored as a direct result of shortcuts in the original work.\nHard to scale\nGood code should be adaptable and able to grow functionally, handling more traffic or data without impacting performance. Hard-to-scale code can be bad code, as it leads to performance issues over time and can cause longer maintenance processes.\nInsecure or vulnerable\nSimple errors and issues with your code can lead to vulnerabilities and create the potential for breaches. Insecure code can be caused by issues such as inserting user input directly into an SQL query without sanitizing it. In this case, a malicious user could expose all user data with a simple input. At Qodana, we strongly emphasize security alongside code quality because unsafe code is bad code, especially in the context of the AI boom.\nProne to bugs and breaking\nIf your code doesn’t consider potential issues, it may be bad code. Any codebase that doesn’t account for invalid user inputs, loops, arrays, or other possible issues could cause problems when it inevitably breaks, especially if it does so after “hiding” for some time.\nLow performance or inefficiency\nPerformance problems make code bad, like a for loop that makes a database call for every single item in it. This can increase the time it takes a page to load or even cause timeouts. A study from the University of Washington showed the impact of inefficient database queries. The study found that fixing these types of issues led to a 98% decrease in webpage response time. \nNot aligned with ways of working\nWhen code doesn’t follow accepted workflows and style regulations, it forces your teammates to slow down, unpack differences, and guess the intent, even if it works. This can lead to significant technical debt. Examples include choosing to use horizontal or vertical indents, having defined line lengths, or figuring out early what your approach will be for using variables.\nPublic commentary from Marius Anderie on Medium\n\n\n\nDefining bad code is good practice\nDefining bad code vs. good code drives quality and efficiency in your output. It makes sure code is fit-for-purpose, helps teams collaborate more easily, lowers technical debt, and leads to the development of performance-led code designed for longevity and scalability.\nIt’s important that everyone working on a project knows what bad code looks like in their specific case. What might be considered bad code in one project could be considered fine in another. Being able to draw the line between the two makes expectations clearer and allows developers to better understand what bad code is. Our Leadership Series features an interview with Vlad Minaev, WebStorm Team Lead, that explores this topic.\nHaving defined parameters for bad code also helps developers understand what to avoid when they have to be more agile. For example, if there are time constraints to consider, what should they be sure to steer clear of to keep code quality high?\nThe impact of bad code\nWe spoke a little bit about how bad code can affect your ability to scale your products, maintain your codebase and preserve your team’s sanity. But let’s look at how bad code can have significant implications for your business in more detail:\nLowering scalability: Unoptimized loops or blocking calls that seem okay during testing can crash your system when user traffic increases. What worked before launch suddenly doesn’t when you need it the most. \nTechnical debt: Bad code makes it difficult and more expensive to correct issues or make future changes to the codebase. One study carried out in 2022 found that fixing technical debt issues consumes as much as 25% of development time.\nBreaching user trust: Bad code directly affects users. For example, a bug that exposes personal data or crashes during checkout can undo months of good customer acquisition work. Users remember bad experiences much more than good ones.\nLosing talent: Retaining good developer talent can also relate directly to the quality of your codebase. Top engineers don’t want to work on codebases filled with issues, where every file reveals a new layer of problems.\nDamaging productivity: Bad code wastes valuable time and impacts productivity, whether it’s causing developers to spend longer deciphering code or spending more time updating and maintaining trickier code. QA cycles may also get longer due to complexity, while fixes get more complex and time-consuming in the long run.\n\n\n\n\n    \nLev Liadov, Software Developer in the Qodana Frontend Team\nBad code is code that forces you into an infinite cycle of fixing one part and breaking another.\nHow to reduce bad code\nThere are plenty of ways to reduce bad code in your codebase, including: \nUnderstand the task: Don’t start coding straight away. Step back, ask questions, and ensure you fully understand the brief. Writing a problem summary will also help lay out expected inputs, outputs, and constraints and turn abstract concepts into real targets.\nChoose the simple option: A clever algorithm that saves time today could cost time tomorrow. If you can’t explain your code in under a minute, rewrite it with collaboration in mind. \nDon’t repeat yourself (DRY): Avoid duplicate code. When you duplicate lines of code, you duplicate bugs and other problems, which can lead to time-consuming fixes required in multiple areas. Follow the rule of three – if you have to write similar code more than twice, turn it into a reusable function.\nWrite small, focused functions: Ensure your functions do what’s intended and don’t creep too much. Small sections of code are easier to understand and test. Keep functions under 30 lines, each doing one job.\nUse meaningful names: Names in your codebase need to be usable. As they’re what people read most often, you should always ensure names for things like variables, functions, and any other identifiers make it clear what they are and what their purpose is to anyone reading your code.\nTest regularly: Implement tests that check overall behaviour and targeted tests for critical algorithms. Regular testing allows you to refactor without fear because you know that when you break something, you can go back to the previous version.\nUse static code analysis tools and peer reviews: Static code analysis tools check for issues in your code, like unused variables, unreachable branches, or security risks. Combine these checks with peer reviews for a tighter review system where everyone shares responsibility for code quality.\nStyle guides and governance: Agree on an internal style guide for your code and stick to it. Consistency allows developers to focus on what the code can do instead of how it looks.\nPrioritize security: Validate inputs, encode outputs, and handle secrets like ​​API keys and passwords correctly by storing them securely using environment variables or secret-management tools. When reviewing code, look for injection attacks and race conditions.\nDocument decisions: Grey areas cause bad code. Document the rationale behind approaches. Why did you choose optimistic locking over pessimistic? Why does the service process events asynchronously instead of synchronously?\nRefactor incrementally: Rebuilding from scratch can introduce new bugs, delaying production. Incremental refactoring processes like code cleanups, replacing legacy patterns, and optimizing slow database queries are often less disruptive, while also making it easier to spot coding problems along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nWise words from Smoothiride700 on Reddit \n\n\n\nBad code is a problem that can lead to costly problems for development teams, projects, and wider businesses. Removing the vagueness from the terminology and knowing what bad code looks like can help you catch problems earlier, make it easier to fix issues, and lower the impact of bad code on your bottom line.\nSpot bad code issues in your codebase with the Qodana code quality tool.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Last year marked the first time we shipped ReSharper and Rider side by side with the official .NET SDK release – and we’re happy to announce that we’ve done it again with the 2025.3 release!\nDownload Rider 2025.3 Download ReSharper 2025.3\nWith .NET 10 and C# 14, both ReSharper and Rider are ready on day one to help you explore the latest language features. Whether you’re diving into extension members, testing out user-defined compound assignment operators, or cleaning up your code with the new field keyword, ReSharper and Rider have your back with inspections, quick-fixes, and refactorings that just work.\nExtension Members\nOne of the most anticipated features in C# 14 are extension members, which have been discussed for quite a while now. Previously, the concept was limited to extension methods (introduced with C# 3), which enabled us to add instance methods to any type we wanted. For instance, the popular Humanizer project is all about adding extensions to manipulate and display primitive types. Until now, you could be sure that all non-instance methods come from the original type – including properties, static members, and operators – but brace yourself! In the spirit of the original issue, we are about to extension everything in C# 14!\nargs <<= args.Count + string.ZeroWidthSpace; // 🫣\r\n\r\nfile static class ExtensionMembers\r\n{\r\n    extension<T>(T[] array)\r\n    {\r\n        public void operator <<= (T item) => array[^1] = item;\r\n        public int Count => array.Count;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    extension(string)\r\n    {\r\n        public static string ZeroWidthSpace => \"\\u200b\";\r\n    }\r\n}\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nIf you’ve been considering advancing your extension library with the use of extension members, now is a good time to do so. ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 come with quick-fixes and context actions to:\nConvert to Extension Block,\nConvert to Classic Extension Methods, and\nMove to Extension Block\nRefactor to extension block and back to classic extension methods\n\n\n\n\nAs part of our support for extension members, we also updated all our existing features to work smoothly, including the Change Signature, and Convert Method to Property refactoring, and the call tracking and value tracking.\nNull-Conditional Assignment\nThe null-conditional operator has been a great addition in C# 6 to reduce the number of null-checks we have to write in our codebase – whether for member access (?.) or element access (?[]). One limitation has been that expressions that use the operator could only be on the right side of an assignment. With C# 14, this constraint has been lifted, and ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 help you convert relevant fragments to use null propagation:\nQuick-fix to use null propagation\n\n\n\n\nField Keyword Updates\nThe field keyword for properties has been introduced in C# 13 as a preview feature. We added day-zero support in 2025.2 to help you convert from explicit backing fields and modernize your codebase quickly. In C# 14, the field keyword has matured to a fully stable language feature, but some details about the nullability of backing fields have changed. More specifically, the compiler now correctly infers the nullability of backing fields for lazy initializations, which allows us to stop emitting [field: AllowNull, MaybeNull] during conversion in ReSharper and Rider 2025.3:\nQuick-fix to replace backing field with field keyword\n\n\n\n\nPartial Constructors & Events\nFor the release of C# 13, we added support for partial properties and indexers. With C# 14, you can also use partial constructors and events. Just like with extension members, we can partial everything:\n// Declaration\r\npartial class WeatherService\r\n{\r\n    partial WeatherService();\r\n    partial event EventHandler DataReceived;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Implementation\r\npartial class WeatherService\r\n{\r\n    partial WeatherService() { }\r\n\r\n    partial event EventHandler DataReceived\r\n    {\r\n        add => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n        remove => throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n    }\r\n}\nCopy to clipboard\n\n            \nWhile this feature enables more control for source generators, ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 also have you covered in pure user-code scenarios. You can implement partial constructors and events in multiple ways, including:\nUsing the Implement member in another part of class quick-fix\nUsing the Generate Code action from the Alt+Enter menu\nUsing code completion after typing partial\nGenerating partial constructors\n\n\n\n\nJust like for partial properties and methods, you can also:\nManage the visibility from any declaration\nMerge members into one declaration\nManipulating and merging partial constructors\n\n\n\n\nSimple Lambda Parameters with Modifiers\nSupport for this language feature was introduced in our 2025.1 release. You can read about it in this blog post here.\nNameof with Unbound Generics\nThat’s another feature our 2025.1 release introduced support for. More about that here. \nBreaking Changes involving Span<T>\nDue to the more refined span conversion and type inference rules, you might see compilation errors about ambiguity or incompatible return types. For instance, when targeting net9.0 with the language version 14.0 (which, after all, is an unsupported scenario), an enumerable.Reverse() call now resolves to MemoryExtensions.Reverse(this Span<T>). For this and all similar cases, we’ve added an inspection with an accompanying quick-fix to choose your preferred workaround:\nQuick-fix for breaking changes from Span<T> APIs\n\n\n\n\nUser-Defined Compound Assignment Operators\nImplementing operator overloads can be a lot of fun – especially the division operator / for path concatenation! But did you know that when rewriting an assignment like a = a + b as a compound assignment a += b, the new value is not created in the most efficient way? Essentially, the compiler still uses the original + operator overload to create a new value, which then replaces the original value of a. Especially when used with heavy data types, like BigInteger, this can have significant performance implications. C# 14 introduces user-defined compound assignments to solve this issue and allow in-place changes without new allocations:\nSyntax highlighting for used-defined compound assignment operators\n\n\n\n\nReSharper and Rider 2025.3 allow you to spot user-defined operators more easily due to their syntax highlighting, to find usages from declarations, as well as to navigate from usages to the declaration.\nAnd that’s it for now\nThese updates ensure that your favorite JetBrains tools are ready for everything C# 14 brings — from enhanced extension syntax to new compiler behaviors and smarter refactorings.\nFor a complete overview of the latest changes and performance improvements, check out the What’s New pages for ReSharper 2025.3 and Rider 2025.3.\nDownload Rider 2025.3 Download ReSharper 2025.3",

Your feedback, bug reports, and upvotes complement our internal QA processes and performance tracking, helping us understand how issues manifest across diverse environments and project setups. This collaboration allows us to prioritize the fixes that have the greatest real-world impact.\nRider 2025.3 continues that tradition. Alongside exciting new features, this release includes over 300 refinements and fixes – the result of our commitment to polishing every part of the IDE experience.\nIn this post, we’ll take a look at the key fixes we’ve made, targeting reliability issues, performance bottlenecks, and the day-to-day friction points you’ve reported and upvoted most.\nDownload Rider 2025.3\n                                                    \nCore stability and smoother workflows\nThis update brings broad stability and performance refinements across the IDE. Startup is faster, visual flicker in the editor has been reduced, and features like code completion, search, and navigation are available earlier in the startup sequence. Our internal benchmark tests tell us you’ll definitely feel the difference in your day-to-day use of Rider 2025.3. \n\n\n\n\nIn addition to those startup performance boosts, we’ve also addressed these most-upvoted issues:\nRIDER-128989 – We’ve fixed an issue that caused Environment.CurrentDirectory to point to the project folder instead of the expected working directory after launching from Rider.\nRIDER-125818 – We’ve corrected a behavior causing files to open unexpectedly in the editor after certain actions.\nStronger unit testing and debugging\nRider 2025.3 comes with fixes for a few long-standing issues that would previously interrupt the testing or debugging cycle, ensuring a smoother feedback loop for developers.\nRIDER-121579 – We’ve prevented the duplication of tests in the test runner UI.\nRIDER-99516 – We’ve resolved an issue that caused the unit test log window to constantly scroll to the top and disrupt the review of test results.\nRIDER-121165 – We’ve improved the Attach to Remote Process dialog so that command-line arguments are displayed correctly.\nRIDER-74532 – We’ve fixed a problem that would cause the IDE to crash when debugging Unreal Engine projects with specific exceptions.\nProject and build system reliability\nThis release introduces numerous under-the-hood improvements to Rider’s project model and build system, particularly for cross-platform .NET projects.\nRIDER-128229 – We’ve fixed an issue that would cause a project to fail unexpectedly when building a class library inside a MAUI project.\nRIDER-125658 – We’ve restored the Show All Files feature in the Solution Explorer view to ensure consistent visibility of non-included files.\nYou should now experience fewer stalls when switching branches or renaming files, and Rider better synchronizes with MSBuild and .NET Core projects to keep your solution model consistent.\nEditing, refactoring, and navigation\nWe’ve also fixed a range of editing and refactoring issues that previously disrupted the flow of coding.\nRIDER-126769 – We’ve removed a hang that occurred during rename refactoring, ensuring it can be safely canceled.\nRIDER-128694 – We’ve fixed a duplication bug in code completion that repeated the first character of the suggested completion.\nRIDER-128778 – We’ve resolved an issue where code completion would use incorrect text ranges after a Split String action.\nGame and cross-platform development improvements\nGame development workflows continue to receive special attention, with targeted fixes across Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot.\nRIDER-125327 – Rider can now download binaries and symbols from the symbol server when debugging a minidump.\nRIDER-115995 – We’ve fixed the Run scene and Debug scene functionality in Godot projects.\nRIDER-86108 – We’ve improved the IL Viewer for Unity projects to ensure compatibility with the latest engine versions.\nRIDER-125818 – We’ve corrected the behavior affecting .NET Core and Unity solutions that caused new files to open in the editor when switching views in the IL Viewer.\nIf you use Rider for game development, be sure to check out the latest feature updates for Unity, Unreal Engine, and Godot on our What’s New in Rider 2025.3 webpage. \nTry the latest fixes early with nightly builds\nIf you ever encounter a blocking issue and need access to a fix before it’s included in a regular bug-fix update, you can switch to Rider’s nightly build channel via the JetBrains Toolbox App. Nightly builds are fully licensed versions of Rider that include the latest changes and fixes under active development.\nSome fixes may not be critical enough to warrant an immediate hotfix release, yet they can still have a noticeable impact on specific workflows. Instead of downgrading to an earlier version, you can use a nightly build to get those improvements right away and continue working without interruption.\nTo access nightly builds, click the three-dot menu next to your current Rider installation in the JetBrains Toolbox App, select Other versions, and choose from the available options. Make sure the version number of the nightly build matches the release you’re currently using.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for now\nIf you’d like to help us decide what to focus on next, head over to this Reddit thread and vote for the top 5 issues you’d like to see fixed in Rider 2026.1.

All relevant refactorings – such as Change Signature, Convert Method to Property, Make Static, and Safe Delete – have been updated to handle extension members correctly.\nNew inspections, quick-fixes, and context actions introduced in 2025.3 will also make it easier to switch between traditional extension methods and the new syntax when refactoring existing code.\nOther ReSharper features have been extended to support these new member types, including:\nUsage analysis that detects and highlights unused extension members.\nImport completion now supports additional scenarios, such as object initializers and pattern matching.\nOptimize usings now correctly recognizes directives required by new extension members.\nCall hierarchy and value tracking allow for accurate exploration of call graphs and data flow involving extensions.\nLearn all there is to know about C# 14 support in ReSharper and Rider 2025.3 from this blog post.\nPerformance improvements\nStartup and shutdown\nReSharper 2025.3 delivers faster startup and shutdown in In-Process mode, with internal testing showing:\n~15% faster startup and full solution load times.\n~50% fewer UI unresponsiveness periods.\nShutdown time reduced by 66%, from 30 seconds to 10 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-Process mode\nReSharper continues to refine Out-of-Process (OOP) mode, improving its stability and responsiveness in Visual Studio. OOP mode remains off by default but can be enabled via Options | Environment | Products & Features → Run ReSharper in separate process.\nFind Usages and Solution-wide analysis\nPerformance improvements also extend to Find Usages in C#. We’ve optimized its handling of language injections, introduced targeted caching, and fine-tuned internal logic. Since Find Usages powers many refactorings, such as Rename and Change Signature, these actions now execute faster.\nSolution-wide analysis (SWA) now becomes available sooner after opening a solution, while keeping Visual Studio more responsive during startup.\nReSharper Build\nReSharper Build is the default tool used in JetBrains Rider and can also be enabled in ReSharper. It allows for faster build times by avoiding the building of dependencies that don’t need to be rebuilt. Unlike MSBuild, ReSharper Build is aware of the managed assemblies and their public surface – if, after your changes, the public surface of the assembly remains unchanged, the dependent projects (without changes) do not need to be built.\nIn 2025.3, we replaced the assembly surface hashing algorithm with a faster, almost allocation-less one, which is powered by Microsoft’s System.Reflection.Metadata library. For large solutions, this new algorithm significantly reduces memory allocation during the build process, resulting in gigabytes less memory being consumed. This means the IDE will build the solution slightly faster (less time spent on hashing) and feel snappier during and after the build is completed (much less allocated memory for garbage collection to handle).\nThe new algorithm is enabled by default and works completely transparently. In the case of problems, you can switch to the old one:\n\n\n\n\nCompatibility with Visual Studio 2026\nReSharper 2025.3 is expected to be fully compatible with Visual Studio 2026. \nLearn how to migrate ReSharper to the latest version of Visual Studio here.\nC++ Support\nReSharper C++ 2025.3 advances C++26 support, adding features such as pack indexing, expansion statements, packs in structured bindings, and contracts. \nFor more C++ updates from the latest release, see this blog post.\nMiscellaneous\nReSharper on Open VSX\nReSharper for VS Code is now listed on the Open VSX Registry, allowing developers using Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium, and other VS Code–compatible editors to install and receive automatic updates – no more manual .vsix downloads.\nThe TeamCity extension returns\nBased on user feedback, the TeamCity extension is back and included once again in the dotUltimate installer. We appreciate everyone who shared how crucial this integration is for their CI workflows.\nCommand-line tools\nThe InspectCode command-line tool now supports writing results directly to standard output with the --stdout option, simplifying CI/CD integration and automation.\ndotTrace, dotMemory, dotCover, and dotPeek \nFor this release cycle, our efforts on JetBrains .NET tools have focused on bug fixes, stability improvements, and a range of minor enhancements across all four tools to ensure a smoother and more reliable experience.\nTell us what you think\nWe’d love to hear your feedback on ReSharper 2025.3!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Building agents is weird. You’re not writing code that does things. You’re writing code that gives an LLM the ability to do things, and the LLM decides what to do.\nWhat is an agent?\nAn agent is an LLM that calls your functions in a loop until it decides the task is complete.\nThat shift takes some getting used to. You give the agent the ability to read files, and it decides which files to read and when. You might expect it to start with the main file. Instead, it reads three test files first to understand the patterns. You didn’t tell it to do that. It just did.\nSo what abilities do you give it? Too many and it picks poorly. Too few and it can’t do the job. Finding that balance means trying things, observing what fails, and adjusting.\nIn this blog series, we’ll explore AI agents by building a real coding agent together, starting with three basic tools and transforming the agent into a complete one over the course of the series. You’ll learn about how agents actually work, how to observe and debug their behavior, and the architectural decisions that matter. By the end, you’ll understand not just this agent, but how to build your own. All in Kotlin.\nWe’ll start simple by building an agent that can navigate a codebase and make targeted changes. We’ll use Koog, an open-source framework from JetBrains that handles the execution loop: sending prompts, parsing tool calls, and executing them, repeating until done. The execution loop can get complex, but we’ll start with a basic one and focus on the more interesting question: what capabilities should your agent actually have?\nBuilding the agent piece by piece\nBefore we write anything, let’s think about what we actually want. An agent that can… do what exactly?\nFix bugs? Write features? Refactor old code?\nWe want it to do all of those things. But what does that actually mean? It means we need an agent that can navigate a codebase and make targeted changes.\nIt needs to be able to see what files are in a project, read those files, and edit them or create new ones – three capabilities that we’ll give it through three tools.\nWhat are tools?\nTools are functions the LLM can call when needed. You decide which ones are present, and the LLM decides when to use them.\nThese three tools are already built and bundled into Koog. We’ll look at how each one works, and then connect them all to GPT-5-Codex. That will give us a complete agent that can explore a codebase, read files, and make changes.\nTeaching it to see\nFirst, we add this tool to give our agent a way to explore:\ntool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\nNow it can look around to see what files exist. But here’s the thing: If you just dump a list of file paths at an agent, it doesn’t really help. The agent needs to understand the structure.\nTo make understanding the structure easier, the tool formats output intelligently. JVM projects have deep package structures. A typical path might be src/main/kotlin/com/example/service/impl/UserServiceImpl.kt. If the tool showed every intermediate directory, the output would be cluttered with single-child directories that add no information. \nSo when it finds a long chain of single directories, it collapses them:\n/project/src/main/kotlin/Main.kt (<0.1 KiB, 20 lines)\nWhen there are multiple files at the same level, it shows a tree:\n/project/src/main/kotlin/\n  Main.kt (<0.1 KiB, 20 lines)\n  Utils.kt (<0.1 KiB, 10 lines)\nNotice the file sizes and line counts are right there. Why show them?\nWithout them, you’ll run into a problem we hit.  When we first built this, we didn’t include file sizes. The agent would explore the directory and see filenames, but have no idea about their size. So when it needed to understand a file, it would just read the entire thing.\nThen we hit a real case: the agent tried to read a Python test file that was over 7,700 lines long. The LLM’s context window filled up with just that one file. When the agent tried to continue working, it had lost track of other files it had read, what it was supposed to be doing, and what changes it needed to make. The single massive file had pushed everything else out of context.\nThat’s why line counts and file sizes are in the directory listing. Now, when the agent explores the codebase, it sees that test_dataset.py is 7,700 lines before trying to read it. It can decide to read just specific sections instead of the whole thing, or skip it entirely if it’s not relevant to the task.\nReading code\nNext, the agent needs to read files:\ntool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\nSee JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly? That’s because this tool doesn’t call java.nio.file APIs directly. It’s built against Koog’s FileSystemProvider interface.\nWhy? So you can write a tool once and use it anywhere. ReadFileTool just calls methods on the provider. It doesn’t care if that provider reads from your local disk, from files over SSH, or from cloud storage. If you pass it to a different provider, the tool works the same way. If you’re building your own file tools, you can implement FileSystemProvider for your storage backend and pass it to Koog’s file tools, and they’ll work.\nWe’re using JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly here. Why is it ReadOnly? By separating read and write permissions at the provider level, you can compose agents with different permission levels. Need an agent that only explores and analyzes code? Give it tools that use ReadOnly providers, and you know for certain it can’t modify anything. For this agent, we’ll add modification capabilities next. EditFileTool will use JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite instead. Clear separation means you control exactly what each agent can and can’t do.\n\n\n\n\nThe tool also supports line ranges:\nreadFile(\"Main.kt\", startLine = 45, endLine = 72)\nRemember those line counts in ListDirectoryTool? This is why. When the agent sees a file with thousands of lines in the directory listing, it knows to be more strategic about reading it. It might read the file in chunks, avoid rereading it multiple times, or extract specific sections. This helps prevent context exhaustion from large files like that 7,700-line Python test file example.\nModifying code\nNow we give the agent the power to actually change things:\ntool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))\nEditFileTool does find-and-replace. Give it a file path, the text to find, and what to replace it with. Simple enough.\nBut here’s what’s interesting: Those three parameters can do different things, depending on what you pass.\nWant to replace text? Specify the original text and the replacement:\nedit_file(\n    path = \"Main.kt\", \n    original = \"Hello World!\", \n    replacement = \"Hello Koog!\"\n)\nWant to delete something? Just make the replacement empty:\nedit_file(\n    path = \"Main.kt\", \n    original = \"Hello World!\", \n    replacement = \"\"\n)\nWant to create a whole new file? Make the original empty:\nedit_file(\n    path = \"Main.kt\", \n    original = \"\", \n    replacement = \"fun main() { println(\\\"Hello World!\\\") }\"\n)\nSame tool. Three different operations.\nLearning from failures\nThe tool works, but we discovered something when testing with real agents. After several edits, the file was different. The agent tried to make another edit, but the text it was looking for didn’t exist anymore. Earlier edits had changed it.\nThe tool was returning “Edit failed”. We figured the agent would re-read the file and try again. Want to guess what happened instead?\nThe agent saw “Edit failed” and thought, “Something’s wrong with this file. Maybe I don’t have permission? I’ll just create a new file with my changes!” Suddenly, there were new files everywhere. Code that should have been edited ended up in new files instead. \nThe fix was simple. We just needed to tell the agent what actually went wrong. We changed the error message to “The original text to replace was not found in the file content. Consider re-reading the file to check if the original has changed since last read”. And that worked. The agents learned: “Oh, text not found, I should re-read and try again.”\nPutting the pieces together\nWe have three tools. Now we need to connect them to GPT-5-Codex.\nIf you were building this from scratch without a framework, you’d write an execution loop: Send a prompt to GPT-5-Codex, parse the response, check if it wants to call a tool, execute that tool, send the results back, repeat. You’d need to handle API requests, error cases, token limits, and the tool calling protocol. That’s a lot of setup and effort.\nHere, Koog’s AIAgent handles that loop. You give it an LLM, tools, and instructions:\nval agent = AIAgent(\n    promptExecutor = simpleOpenAIExecutor(System.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")),\n    llmModel = OpenAIModels.Chat.GPT5Codex,\nThis connects the agent to GPT-5-Codex. promptExecutor is Koog’s way of handling LLM communication. You give it an API key and model, and it takes care of the rest.\nNow tell it about your tools:\n    toolRegistry = ToolRegistry {\n        tool(ListDirectoryTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(ReadFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadOnly))\n        tool(EditFileTool(JVMFileSystemProvider.ReadWrite))\n    },\nToolRegistry is where you list your tools. Koog takes each tool, converts it into the JSON format GPT-5-Codex expects, and handles calling them when GPT-5-Codex requests it. \nGive it instructions:\n    systemPrompt = \"\"\"\n        You are a highly skilled programmer tasked with updating the provided codebase according to the given task.\n        Your goal is to deliver production-ready code changes that integrate seamlessly with the existing codebase \n        and solve given task.\n    \"\"\".trimIndent(),\nThis is the system prompt that tells the agent what its job is. Notice “updating the provided codebase”? That’s what makes the agent actually modify files instead of just explaining what should change.\nTell it how to run:\n    strategy = singleRunStrategy(),\n    maxIterations = 100\nThe strategy is the agent loop. singleRunStrategy() is Koog’s built-in basic version. The agent calls tools until it decides the task is complete. We’ll explore how to write complex custom strategies in future articles, but this one works for most tasks.\nBut what if it never stops? We once had an agent read a 7,000-line file, hit the token limit, lose context, and then read the same file again – over and over. Luckily maxIterations = 200 stopped it before burning through our API budget. After 200 steps, the agent quits. Each tool call costs 2 steps (one for the call, one for the response), so that’s 100 calls max.\nSometimes the agent will run for a bit, leaving you sitting there wondering if it’s working or stuck. We want to add some visibility to the agent, so we can see what it’s doing. The handleEvents block is how you watch what’s going on in Koog:\n{\n    handleEvents {\n        onToolCallStarting { ctx -> println(\"Tool '${ctx.tool.name}' called with args:\" +\n                \" ${ctx.toolArgs.toString().take(100)}\")\n        }\n    }\n}\nKoog gives you different events to hook into, like onToolCallStarting, onToolCallFinished, onAgentFinished, and others. We’re using onToolCallStarting here, which runs right before each tool executes, so we can log what’s about to happen. \nYou’ll want to tune what you log, though. The first time we did this, we printed everything. EditFileTool scrolled hundreds of lines past us. Then we tried just the tool name. EditFileTool ran three times, and we had no idea what it was editing. We print 100 characters now. You can follow what’s happening without staring at too much text.\nRunning our agent\nThe agent is built. Now we need a way to actually use it:\nfun main(args: Array<String>) = runBlocking {\n    if (args.size < 2) {\n        println(\"Error: Please provide the project absolute path and a task as arguments\")\n        println(\"Usage: <absolute_path> <task>\")\n        return@runBlocking\n    }\n\n    val (path, task) = args\n    val input = \"Project path: $path\\n\\n$task\"\n    val result = agent.run(input)\n    println(result)\n}\nThe agent needs to know two things: where the project lives and what to do. With this block of code, we grab both from command line arguments. If they’re missing, we show an error. Otherwise, we combine them into one input string and call agent.run().\nThe agent takes over from there. It explores the project, reads files, and makes changes, looping until done. When it finishes, we print the result.\nHere’s what it looks like in action:\nDoes it work?\nOnce we had the agent running, we wanted to see what these three tools could actually accomplish. So we tested it on SWE-bench Verified, a benchmark of 500 coding tasks from GitHub issues. \nIt completed around 50% of them – not bad for 50 lines of code.\nBut the agent never verifies anything. Can’t compile. Can’t run tests. It reads code and makes changes based on what it sees, but has no way to know if those changes actually work.\nAnd we’ve used three tools without showing you how to build one. You know what they do, but you don’t know how they work or how to make your own.\nThat’s what my colleague Bruno shows you in the next article of this series. He builds a shell execution tool from scratch so the agent can run commands, see the output, and learn from what breaks. And he walks through how Koog tools work, because 50 lines of code only matter if you can extend the agent with tools for your specific problems.\nThe code’s on GitHub.

This update is the result of extensive collaboration with developers and incorporates valuable feedback from the community. We’ve improved typography, iconography, and the overall layout to minimize distractions and keep your code front and center. Each update is designed to support modern workflows, making Visual Studio a more intuitive, consistent, and personal experience.\nDownload the Insiders release and try our new visual improvements, AI integrated development capabilities, and latest performance improvements that reset expectations for speed at enterprise scale.\nA design that puts your code first\nOne of the biggest feedback themes we heard from you was clarity. Developers told us that small inconsistencies and visual noise add up, especially on dense screens and large solutions. To address that, we refined the visual details of many elements, improved the layout and overall spacing to make navigation clearer, and to reduce distractions. Our goal was to minimize distractions and enable greater productivity by allowing you to focus on your work more efficiently.\n\nFrom the moment you launch Visual Studio 2026, you’ll notice the updated Get Started and What’s New experiences. These aren’t just visual upgrades; they’re designed to preview a smoother, more developer-friendly workflow that keeps your code front and center.\n\n \nA new settings experience: modern, consistent, and transparent\nVisual Studio 2026 introduces a completely redesigned settings experience, built for transparency, consistency, and ease of use. Our aim was to modernize how settings are managed, making them easier to discover and adjust. The new interface provides a streamlined, intuitive way to configure your environment, an improved search that delivers more accurate and better organized results, and, for those who want direct control, a new underlying JSON file that makes every change visible and trackable in real time.\nThe settings interface is now fully themed, so your preferences carry through the look and feel of the IDE in a transparent and accessible way that fits modern development workflows.\n\nWe’ve converted most of the popular settings and are actively working to add more. For any settings not yet updated, you’ll find them under a More Settings node, which provides legacy links to their respective areas. This approach ensures your workflow remains uninterrupted as we continue to enhance the overall experience.\nThemes that feel personal (and accessible by default)\nPersonalization matters, but so does readability. That’s why we’re introducing 11 new tinted themes that incorporate subtle color accents onto Light or Dark backgrounds, enabling you to select an appearance that matches your environment or mood. Our built-in themes boost accessibility enhancements such as increased contrast and improved text legibility, designed to minimize eye strain and support users with specific needs.\n \n\nIf you develop themes or extensions, keep an eye out for updated guidance coming soon. We’ll provide tips and best practices to help you craft unique and engaging experiences in the refreshed Visual Studio 2026 environment.\nNew editor appearance: your code, your way\nWe recognize how important it is to customize your IDE experience. Alongside the new collection of themes, we’ve added an editor appearance setting that lets you choose whether the editor matches the IDE theme or stands apart.\nFor those who need or prefer higher contrast, there are now additional extra contrast options available specifically for the editor. These updates make it easier to personalize Visual Studio while also supporting accessibility and readability needs.\n\n\nYour editor font family, size, and style persist as you try different themes, so personalization doesn’t mean starting over.\nTry it and tell us what you think\nReady to try out the new look, AI capabilities, and faster performance in Visual Studio 2026? You can install it alongside your current version, so it’s easy to explore what’s new without disrupting your current setup.\nLet us know what you think and share any problems or suggestions via Developer Community Feedback.\nThe post A first look at the all‑new UX in Visual Studio 2026 appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

With auto, you don’t need to choose a specific model. Copilot automatically selects the best one for your task. Auto model selection in Chat is rolling out in preview to all GitHub Copilot users.\nHow auto model selection works\nAuto selects the best model to ensure that you get the optimal performance and reduce the likelihood of rate limits. Auto will choose between GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, GPT-4.1, Sonnet 4.5, and Haiku 4.5 and other models, unless your organization has disabled access to these models. Once auto picks a model, it uses that same model for the entire chat session. As we introduce picking models based on task complexity, this behavior will change over the next iterations.\nFor paid users, we currently primarily rely on Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the model powering auto.\n\nWhen using auto model selection, Visual Studio uses a variable model multiplier based on the automatically selected model. If you are a paid user, auto applies a 10% request discount. For example, if auto selects Sonnet 4.5, it will be counted as 0.9x of a premium request.\nIf you are a paid user and run out of premium requests, auto will always choose a 0x model (for example, GPT-4.1), so you can continue using auto without interruption.\nWhat’s next\nOur long-term vision for auto. We aim to make auto the best model selection for most users and to achieve this, here’s what we plan next:\nDynamically switch between small and large models based on the task – this flexibility ensures that you get the right balance of performance and efficiency, while saving on requests\nAdd more language models to auto\nLet users on a free plan take advantage of the latest models through auto\nImprove the model dropdown to make it more obvious which models and discounts are used\nThanks \nThe post Introducing Copilot auto model selection (preview) appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Dear developers,\nWe’re thrilled to announce that Visual Studio 2026 is now generally available! This is a moment we’ve built side by side with you. Your feedback has helped shape this release more than any before. Since the introduction of the Insiders Channel in September, more developers have downloaded and tested this preview than any other in Visual Studio’s history.\nIn the year leading up to this release, we fixed over 5,000 of your reported bugs and implemented 300 feature requests. That’s the most we’ve ever done, and we’re just getting started!\nWith several performance improvements, a redesigned user experience, and a major leap in AI-driven development, this release is built to help developers focus on what truly matters: creating. Every click, keystroke, and compile is now smoother, faster, and more intuitive – empowering you to turn ideas into code at unprecedented speed.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026\n\nYou know that sinking feeling when lag interrupts your flow? We’ve worked hard to make that a thing of the past. Blazing-fast performance means startup is significantly snappier, and the UI responds so smoothly you’ll barely notice it’s there, cutting hangs by over 50% and giving the IDE a lightweight, effortless vibe, even on massive projects. Whether you’re wrangling enterprise-scale repos or tinkering on smaller codebases, this sets a new bar for getting stuff done.\nFigure 1: Shows large .NET solution load time to interactive is faster than in VS 2022\nBut it’s not just about loading solutions faster. The UI stays more responsive while things are loading too. In fact, those annoying UI freezes have been cut by more than half.\nFigure 2: Shows the amount of time the UI is unresponsive is less than half of VS 2022 on large solution loads\nStats are cool, but what really matters is how it actually feels to use. The IDE just runs way faster, smoother, and more responsive. That’s something you can’t always see in the numbers.\n \n“Wow! I just opened a solution with over 100 projects, and I can’t believe how fast it came up and was ready! Well done, Visual Studio team!”\n– Steve Smith, Principal Software Architect, NimblePros\n \nVisual Studio 2026 is AI-native, making it the world’s first Intelligent Developer Environment (IDE). That doesn’t mean changing how you work. It means giving you intelligence when it matters most. If you’re debugging a tricky issue, profiling performance, or modernizing an application, AI steps in to remove friction and surface insights that help you move faster without disrupting your flow. It’s there to elevate the practices you already trust, not replace them.\nThis release also brings new C# and C++ agents, designed for professional developers who need precision and speed every day. These capabilities extend what you can do without adding complexity, so you stay in control while accomplishing more in less time. Visual Studio 2026 isn’t AI for the sake of AI, but a natural evolution of the tools you rely on to get the job done while boosting your productivity.\n \n\n \nThis evolution opens doors to possibilities that once felt out of reach, weaving AI naturally into your daily flow. GitHub Copilot has quickly become one of the most used features in Visual Studio, earning praise from developers who rely on it every day.\n \n“The Profiler Agent in Visual Studio immediately highlighted the bottlenecks and guided me to faster, cleaner performance – like having a built-in performance coach.”\n– Roberto Perez, Senior Global Solutions Architect, Redis\n \nWhen you’re using Visual Studio all day long, every interaction matters. We’ve doubled down on perfecting the essentials – removing friction, fixing those subtle “paper cuts,” and refining the flow of your work. This release introduces a flexible new settings system, a beautifully modern UI redesign, and hundreds of under-the-hood improvements that make the IDE feel better in every way.\nFigure 3: The amount of feedback tickets implemented by the Visual Studio team in the past 12 months\nOver the past 12 months, your feedback has helped us fix more than 5,000 bugs and added over 300 feature requests. Our biggest push leading up to a major Visual Studio release yet, and the momentum is still growing. With AI-driven tools accelerating how we identify and resolve issues, we’re delivering improvements faster than ever before.\n \n“What I love most about Visual Studio 2026 is the performance and the fresh and crisp UI – and support for Mermaid diagrams is the icing on the cake.”\n– Erik Ejlskov Jensen, Context& A/S\n \nHere’s the best part: Visual Studio 2026 is fully compatible with your projects and extensions from Visual Studio 2022. Open your existing solutions and start coding immediately. No migration steps, no surprises. All your favorite extensions are available too, so your workspace, tools, and projects transition seamlessly, making the IDE feel like home from the very first launch.\nThe over 4,000 extensions that works with Visual Studio 2022 today, all work with Visual Studio 2026 too. You can upgrade with peace of mind, and your setup will feel just as stable and familiar as ever.\n \n“Getting the extensions from Visual Studio 2022 was a definitive plus: I was ready to use VS 2026 immediately”\n– Didier Donner, Principal Software Engineer, Aspen Technology\n \nPlus, with GitHub Copilot app modernization, upgrades to .NET 10 and the latest C++ build tools are accelerated and guided with expertise, so you’re ready to take full advantage of all the latest performance enhancements and features. GitHub Copilot’s new C++ capabilities are available now in Private Preview.\nFor a long time, updating Visual Studio meant you also had to upgrade your .NET and C++ build tools, since those were tightly linked to the IDE. That often made things tricky, because you’d want the latest features and bug fixes, but the update could mess with your existing projects or force you into toolchain changes you weren’t ready for.\nVisual Studio 2026 changes all that. Now the IDE is decoupled from its build tools, so you can update Visual Studio itself any time you want without affecting your .NET or C++ compilers. Even better, you’ll get automatic monthly updates with fresh features, design tweaks, and productivity boosts delivered right to your IDE, while keeping your toolchains stable for as long as you need.\nIf you like to try out new features before everyone else, the Insiders Channel is for you. It receives frequent updates and allows you to evaluate the newest features without impacting your primary setup, as it can be installed alongside the Stable version. Many people already use it to stay up to date. Join the Insiders Channel to always have the newest features first.\nCurious about what else to find in this new version? Check out the Release Notes for the full scoop.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026 now and swing by the Visual Studio Developer Community to share what’s working, what you’re creating, or where we can step it up. We’re listening.\nWhat to expect next\nIf you’re a Visual Studio subscriber, simply sign in to Visual Studio 2026 and your license will activate automatically.\nSubscribers who use product keys can retrieve them anytime at my.visualstudio.com.\nFor developers who want to purchase a stand-alone Professional license, Visual Studio 2026 will be available through the Microsoft Store starting December 1, 2025.\nDownload Visual Studio 2026\n\nHuge thanks to our Insiders and MVPs for making this release something special.

        "contentSnippet": "특허 정보의 새로운 지평을 여는 획기적인 소식을 들고 왔습니다. 인공지능이 특허 검색의 오랜 장벽을 허물고 모두에게 IP 지식을 선사하는 시대, 바로 퍼플렉시티 특허가 그 시작을 알렸습니다. 과거의 복잡했던 특허 검색은 잊으세요. 이제 자연어 질문만으로도 혁신의 속도에 발맞춘 지식을 얻을 수 있습니다.\n✨ 2025년, AI 특허 시대의 서막: 퍼플렉시티 특허를 소개합니다\n\n\n 퍼플렉시티 팀은 전 세계에 획기적인 발표를 했습니다. 바로 퍼플렉시티 특허(Perplexity Patents)의 출시인데요. 제 생각에 이 서비스는 ‘AI 특허 연구 에이전트’라는 이름이 딱 어울리는, 정말 놀라운 기술이라고 할 수 있어요. 이전까지 특허 정보는 사실 전문가들만의 영역처럼 느껴졌잖아요? 복잡한 검색 시스템, 비싼 전문 플랫폼, 그리고 알 수 없는 구문들… 저 같은 일반인이나 심지어 숙련되지 않은 연구자들에게는 넘기 어려운 장벽이었죠.\n하지만 퍼플렉시티 특허는 이 모든 것을 바꿀 준비가 되어있습니다. 이제 누구나 특허 지능에 접근하고, 여러 질문에 걸쳐 맥락을 유지하면서 빠르고 명확한 답변을 얻을 수 있게 되었어요. 이건 마치 혁신의 속도에 맞춰 지식을 얻을 수 있는 새로운 문이 열린 것과 다름없다고 생각합니다.\n  주목할 점: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 인류의 호기심과 독창성이 실제 혁신으로 이어지는 과정에서 발생한 '특허'라는 지적 유물을, 모두가 접근할 수 있는 지식의 보고로 탈바꿈시키고 있습니다. 지식의 순환을 가속화하는 핵심적인 역할을 할 것으로 기대돼요.\n ️ 자연어와 특허 지능의 만남: 대화형 검색의 혁명\n퍼플렉시티 특허의 가장 큰 매력 중 하나는 바로 자연어 검색 기능입니다. 기존에는 복잡한 키워드 조합이나 전문적인 검색 구문을 익혀야만 원하는 특허를 찾을 수 있었죠. 그런데 퍼플렉시티는 달라요. 마치 친구에게 질문하듯이 편하게 물어보면 됩니다.\n“언어 학습을 위한 AI 관련 특허가 있을까?”\n“2024년 이후 주요 양자 컴퓨팅 특허는?”\n\n\n이런 식으로 질문하면 퍼플렉시티가 자동으로 특허 관련 쿼리를 이해하고, 관련 특허 컬렉션을 제공해줍니다. 게다가 인라인 뷰어와 원본 문서로의 직접 링크까지 제공하니, 제가 굳이 이리저리 찾아다닐 필요가 없는 거죠. 정말 편리하지 않나요?\n저는 이 ‘인용 중심(citation-first)’ 접근 방식이 특허 검색의 판도를 완전히 바꿀 거라고 확신해요. 권위 있는 출처와 AI 기반 지능의 이런 매끄러운 통합은 특허 연구를 그야말로 즐겁고 손쉬운 일로 만들어줍니다. 이건 단순히 검색이 아니라, 마치 전문가와 대화하는 것 같은 경험이에요.\n⚠️ 주의할 점: 아무리 자연어 검색이 편리하다 해도, 특정 용어나 기술에 대한 정확한 정보를 얻고 싶을 때는 핵심 키워드를 포함하는 것이 더 효율적인 결과를 가져올 수 있습니다. AI는 문맥을 이해하지만, 사용자의 의도를 명확히 전달하는 것은 중요합니다.\n\n\n더 깊이 파고들고 싶거나, 다른 발명품들을 비교하고 싶을 때도 걱정 없습니다. 후속 질문을 던지면 되니까요. 처음부터 다시 시작할 필요 없이, 퍼플렉시티는 관련 후속 주제까지 제안해주면서 새로운 연구 방향을 탐색하고 지식을 확장하는 데 도움을 줍니다. 솔직히 말하면, 제가 겪어본 바로는 이런 대화형 검색은 특허 연구의 생산성을 정말 엄청나게 끌어올려 줍니다.\n⚙️ 실제 특허 업무를 위한 설계: 숨겨진 선행 기술까지 찾아내다\n퍼플렉시티 특허는 단순히 키워드를 일치시키는 것을 넘어섭니다. 예를 들어, ‘피트니스 트래커’를 검색하면 기존 도구들은 그 정확한 용어가 포함된 특허만 보여주기 일쑤였죠. 하지만 퍼플렉시티 특허는 ‘활동 밴드’, ‘걸음 수 측정 시계’, ‘건강 모니터링 웨어러블’과 같이 다른 용어를 사용했더라도 중요한 발명품을 찾아냅니다.\n이게 가능한 이유는 바로 최첨단 에이전트 기반 연구 시스템(state-of-the-art agentic research system) 덕분입니다. AI 연구 에이전트가 복잡한 쿼리를 구체적인 정보 검색 작업으로 세분화하고, 이를 자체 엑사바이트(exabyte) 규모 검색 인프라에 호스팅된 특수 특허 지식 인덱스를 사용해 실행합니다. 그 결과는 에이전트가 후속 연구를 안내하고, 수십에서 수백 개의 보조 문서로 질문에 답변하는 데 사용됩니다.\n결국 사용자 입장에선 더 이상 정확한 키워드를 입력하거나 복잡한 절차를 거칠 필요가 없다는 거죠. 퍼플렉시티 특허는 고급 AI를 사용하여 실시간으로 실제 답변을 제공하며, 심지어 제가 미처 생각하지 못했을 질문에 대한 답까지 찾아줍니다. 이 부분은 정말 대단하다고 생각해요. 특허 전문 변리사님들도 이 기능에 감탄할 것 같습니다.\n\n\n  전통적인 특허 데이터베이스를 넘어서: 전체 혁신 생태계를 탐색하다\n엔지니어, 연구원, 특허 실무자, 그리고 비즈니스 리더들은 모두 알 겁니다. 실제 혁신은 하나의 정해진 틀 안에 깔끔하게 들어맞지 않는다는 것을요. 요즘 선행 기술은 블로그, 비디오, 심지어 컴퓨터 코드와 같이 점점 더 다양하고 비전통적인 형태로 나타나고 있어요.\n퍼플렉시티 특허의 진정한 강점은 바로 여기에 있습니다. 단순히 특허 문헌만 검색하는 데 그치지 않는다는 점이죠. 필요하다면 학술 논문, 공개 소프트웨어 저장소, 그리고 새로운 아이디어와 돌파구가 처음 나타나는 다른 출처까지 탐색합니다. 저는 이런 광범위한 접근 방식이 정말 중요하다고 봐요. 왜냐하면 혁신의 초기 단계 정보는 특허 출원보다 훨씬 먼저 블로그나 학술지에 등장하는 경우가 많기 때문이죠.\n이것은 곧 우리가 트렌드를 포착하고, 관련 기술을 발견하며, 혁신의 전체적인 그림을 볼 수 있다는 것을 의미합니다. 경쟁사 분석이나 새로운 시장 기회를 탐색하는 비즈니스 리더들에게는 정말 귀중한 도구가 될 거예요. 저도 개인적으로 신기술 동향을 파악할 때 이 기능을 유용하게 사용할 것 같습니다.\n\n\n  퍼플렉시티 특허, 이제 당신의 손안에! (베타 출시)\n퍼플렉시티는 퍼플렉시티 특허를 오늘부터 전 세계적으로 베타(beta) 제품으로 출시했습니다. 가장 좋은 소식은, 베타 기간 동안 모든 사용자에게 무료로 제공된다는 점입니다! (정말 놀랍지 않나요?)\nPro 및 Max 구독자는 추가 사용량 할당 및 모델 구성 옵션을 받게 됩니다. 저는 일반 사용자도 무료로 이 강력한 도구를 경험할 수 있다는 점이 정말 매력적이라고 생각합니다. 일단 특허 관련 질문으로 시작해보세요. 퍼플렉시티가 전 세계의 특허 지능을 여러분의 손끝으로 가져다줄 겁니다.\n  핵심 요약\n1. AI 특허 시대 개막: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 AI를 활용해 복잡했던 특허 검색을 대중화합니다.\n2. 자연어 대화형 검색: 키워드 대신 일반적인 질문으로 특허 정보를 얻고, 후속 질문으로 깊이 탐색할 수 있습니다.\n3. 강력한 선행 기술 탐색: 유연한 검색으로 숨겨진 관련 특허 및 비전통적인 선행 기술까지 찾아냅니다.\n4. 혁신 생태계 전체 분석: 특허 문헌 외 학술지, 코드 등 다양한 출처를 탐색해 전체적인 트렌드를 파악할 수 있습니다.\n이제 여러분도 IP 정보의 바다를 헤치고 혁신적인 아이디어를 발굴할 수 있습니다. 이 기회를 놓치지 마세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 퍼플렉시티 특허는 기존 특허 검색 엔진과 무엇이 다른가요?\nA1: 기존 검색 엔진은 정확한 키워드와 복잡한 구문이 필요했지만, 퍼플렉시티 특허는 자연어 질문으로도 관련 특허를 찾아줍니다.

'굳이 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능을 놔두고 왜 이 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱을 사용해야 할까?' 저는 이유가 명확하다고 봅니다.\n첫째, 압도적인 속도입니다. JSON 파일만 제공되면 제미나이가 슬라이드를 만드는 데는 몇 분이 걸리지만, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 단 몇 초면 완벽한 슬라이드가 완성됩니다. 업무에서는 속도도 정말 중요하잖아요? 둘째, 전문성과 실용성입니다. 제미나이의 결과물이 데이터의 '원본'이나 '초안' 성격이 강하다면, '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 이 원본을 기반으로 브랜드 정체성을 입히고 청중의 이해도를 높이는 시각적으로 정제된 '최종 비즈니스 자료'에 가깝습니다. 고객사 미팅, 내부 보고, 투자 유치(IR) 등 공식적인 발표에 사용하기에는 전문성과 가독성, 그리고 브랜드 통일성을 갖춘 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'가 훨씬 더 적합하다고 제가 직접 써보니 느꼈습니다.\n게다가 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 만든 자료에는 발표자 메모가 자동으로 추가되어 있어요. 이는 내용 전달의 정확성과 일관성을 확보해줄 뿐만 아니라, 발표자의 긴장감을 줄여주고 발표 시간 관리에도 정말 큰 도움이 됩니다. 이 정도면 업무용으로는 훨씬 강력한 도구라고 할 수 있겠죠?\n✅ 실전 가이드: '슬라이드 빌더 AI' 활용법\n이제 이론은 충분히 이해하셨을 테니, 실제로 어떻게 이 강력한 도구들을 활용하여 프레젠테이션 자료를 만드는지 단계별로 자세히 알려드릴게요! 먼저 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'부터 시작해봅시다.\n\n\n1. 스크립트 형식 선택: 나에게 맞는 스타일은?\n'슬라이드 빌더 AI' 웹사이트에 접속하면, 가장 먼저 '슬라이드 스크립트 형식 선택'이라는 라디오 버튼들을 보실 수 있을 거예요. 여기에는 크게 세 가지 옵션이 있습니다:\n'표준 형식': 마진(まじん)님의 원작 형식으로, 가장 범용적으로 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적인 팀 미팅이나 프로젝트 발표에 적합하죠.\n'확장판': 키무라 요시키(kimura_yoshiki)님이 개선한 버전입니다. 좀 더 상세하고 다양한 패턴의 슬라이드가 필요할 때 유용해요. 학술 발표나 교육 자료를 만들 때 특히 좋습니다.\n'C-Suite 보고 형식': 제가 특별히 만든 형식이에요. 마치 전략기획 전문가가 만든 것처럼 CEO나 임원진, 또는 중요한 고객 발표에 최적화된 고급 형식입니다.\n  C-Suite 보고 형식의 강점!\n이 형식은 간결하면서도 핵심을 꿰뚫는 메시지 전달에 특화되어 있어, 바쁜 임원진이나 중요한 의사결정권자에게 깊은 인상을 남기기에 정말 효과적입니다. 저는 이 형식을 만들면서 제 오랜 경험을 갈아 넣었다고 해도 과언이 아니에요!\n2. 발표 주제 입력 및 정보 수집\n스크립트 형식을 선택하셨다면, 이제 발표 주제를 입력할 차례입니다. 여기서는 여러분이 직접 주제를 입력하거나, 준비된 문서를 AI가 분석하게 할 수 있어요. 특히 '웹 검색'에 체크하면, AI가 미리 학습한 지식 기반이 아닌, 공신력 있는 최신 웹 정보를 중심으로 정보를 가져와 스크립트를 생성해줍니다. 최신 트렌드나 시의성 있는 주제를 다룰 때 아주 유용하겠죠.\n3. JSON 스크립트 생성 및 실시간 편집\n정보 제공이 끝나면 'AI로 구상안 만들기' 버튼을 클릭해보세요. 잠시 후, 전략적으로 구조화된 JSON 형태의 슬라이드 스크립트가 짠 하고 생성됩니다. 그런데 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'의 진정한 강점은 여기서 끝이 아니에요!\n우측 화면에는 생성된 JSON 파일의 내용을 슬라이드 별로 직접 편집할 수 있는 기능이 제공됩니다. 사용자가 수정한 내용은 왼쪽의 JSON 내용에 실시간으로 반영되며, 개별 슬라이드뿐만 아니라 전체 슬라이드에도 AI를 활용한 수정이 가능해요. 이 기능 덕분에 AI가 생성한 초안을 여러분의 의도에 맞춰 완벽하게 다듬을 수 있습니다. 제가 직접 써보니, 이 실시간 편집 기능이 정말 편리하고 효율적이었어요.\n✨ '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 완성도 높은 슬라이드 만들기\n'슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 JSON 파일을 완벽하게 다듬으셨다면, 이제 그 결과물을 실제 구글 슬라이드로 변환할 차례입니다. 최종 완성된 JSON 파일을 복사하고, 화면 맨 아래에 있는 'Google 슬라이드 생성기' 버튼을 클릭하여 해당 웹앱으로 이동하세요.\n\n\n처음 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'에 진입하면 앱스크립트 권한에 대한 보안 경고가 나타날 수 있어요. 당황하지 마시고 화면의 지시에 따라 권한을 허용해주시면 됩니다. (참고로, 이러한 권한은 앱이 여러분의 구글 드라이브에 슬라이드를 생성하기 위해 필요한 최소한의 조치이니 안심하세요!)\n이제 좀 전에 복사한 JSON 파일의 내용을 붙여넣기 하고 '프레젠테이션 생성' 버튼을 클릭하면 됩니다. 단 몇 초 후, 놀랍게도 완벽하게 디자인된 슬라이드가 생성될 거예요. '슬라이드 열기'를 클릭하면 결과물을 바로 확인할 수 있으니, 이 빠르고 효율적인 워크플로우를 직접 경험해보세요!\n추가 팁: 제미나이(Gemini)에서도 슬라이드 생성하기\n만약 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱 대신 제미나이를 통해 슬라이드를 생성하고 싶으시다면, 이 방법도 알려드릴게요. 동일하게 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 생성된 JSON을 복사한 다음, 앱 하단의 '제미나이 바로 가기' 버튼을 클릭합니다.\n제미나이 채팅창에서 캔버스 기능을 활성화한 후, 복사한 JSON을 붙여넣고 맨 위에 '아래 내용을 프레젠테이션으로 생성해'라고 입력하면 됩니다. 몇 분 정도 시간이 소요되지만, 제미나이도 역시 슬라이드를 멋지게 생성해 줄 거예요. 생성이 완료된 결과물은 우측 상단의 '슬라이드로 내보내기'를 클릭하면 구글 슬라이드에서 편집할 수 있고, 거기서 PPTX나 PDF로 저장도 가능하니 참고하세요!\n  만렙 직장인의 비법: 'C-Suite 보고 형식' 활용 심화\n제가 개인적으로 가장 추천하는 기능이자, 제 20년 노하우가 집약된 'C-Suite 보고 형식'을 활용하는 방법을 좀 더 깊이 있게 다뤄볼게요. 이 기능은 정말이지 임원분들이 딱 좋아할 만한, 핵심만 콕콕 짚어주는 슬라이드를 만들어줍니다. 예를 들어, '2026년 글로벌 전기차 시장 전망 보고서'를 만든다고 가정해봅시다.\n먼저 '슬라이드 빌더 AI'에서 'C-Suite 보고 형식'을 선택합니다. 그리고 최신 자료가 필요하므로 '웹 검색'도 꼭 선택해주세요. 그다음 발표 주제에 맞는 옵션을 선택하고, 주제인 '2026년 글로벌 전기차 시장 전망 보고서'를 입력합니다. 이어서 이번 발표의 목적을 주제에 맞게 선택하고 예상 발표 시간까지 설정해주세요. 마지막으로 주제에 맞는 목차를 선택하고 'AI로 구상안 만들기' 버튼을 클릭하면, 잠시 후 전략적인 슬라이드 스크립트가 JSON 형식으로 생성됩니다.\n스크립트가 JSON 형식으로 생성되면, 우측의 편집 메뉴에서 내용을 쉽게 수정할 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 두 번째 슬라이드 제목이 '발표 아젠다'인데, 이걸 '목차'로 변경하면 JSON 내용도 바로바로 변경되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 여러분의 의도에 맞게 스크립트를 완벽하게 다듬었다면, JSON을 복사해서 다시 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'로 넘어갑니다. 그리고 복사한 JSON을 바로 붙여넣기 해주세요.\n커스터마이징 옵션 상세: 나만의 슬라이드로!\n'구글 슬라이드 생성기'에서는 슬라이드에 적용할 여러 옵션을 세밀하게 설정할 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, '색상' 기능으로는 실제 슬라이드에 적용되는 테마 색상을 변경할 수 있는데요. 핑크색상을 포함해서 원하는 색상을 변경하고, 나중에 다시 사용할 수 있도록 프리셋으로 저장해둘 수도 있어요. '글꼴'도 원하는 스타일로 선택할 수 있고, '바닥글'도 자유롭게 변경 가능합니다.\n'꾸미기 설정'에서는 슬라이드에 포함되거나 제외될 여러 시각적 요소를 선택할 수 있고, '그라데이션 적용'은 슬라이드 내 도형의 색상에 단색이 아닌 아름다운 그라데이션을 입혀줍니다. 만약 로고를 넣고 싶다면, 업로드한 이미지 주소를 입력하여 변경할 수 있으니 참고하세요. 마지막으로 슬라이드 배경 이미지도 구글 드라이브에 등록한 이미지나 이미지 공유 사이트(예: Pexels)에서 찾은 배경 이미지 주소를 등록하면, 모든 슬라이드에 일괄 적용할 수 있습니다. 저는 Pexels에서 '배경이미지'로 검색해서 멋진 이미지를 찾았답니다!\n⚠️ 잠깐! 생성 시간에 대한 팁\n모든 설정이 끝나면 '프레젠테이션 생성'을 클릭하는데요, 설정에서 그라데이션 적용이나 배경 이미지 주소를 추가하면 기본 설정보다 슬라이드 생성에 좀 더 많은 시간이 소요될 수 있습니다. 시각적 퀄리티를 높이는 만큼 약간의 시간 투자가 필요하다는 점, 염두에 두시면 좋습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI는 기획력과 스토리라인이 뒷받침될 때 진가를 발휘해요.\n✅ '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 전략적인 JSON 스크립트로 발표 뼈대를 탄탄하게 만들어줘요.\n✅ '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 생성된 JSON을 몇 초 만에 실무에 최적화된 구글 슬라이드로 변환해줘요.\n✅ 'C-Suite 보고 형식'은 임원/고객 보고에 특화된 전문적인 슬라이드를 가능하게 해요.\n이 워크플로우를 통해 여러분의 발표 준비는 완전히 새로운 차원으로 도약할 것입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'와 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'는 어떤 관계인가요?\nA1: '슬라이드 빌더 AI'는 여러분의 문서를 분석하여 발표의 전략적인 스토리라인과 슬라이드 구조를 JSON 형식으로 만들어주는 도구입니다. 이렇게 생성된 JSON 스크립트를 실제로 구글 슬라이드 문서로 변환해주는 것이 바로 '구글 슬라이드 생성기' 웹앱입니다. 둘은 완벽한 프레젠테이션 자동 생성 워크플로우를 위한 핵심적인 짝꿍이라고 할 수 있습니다.\nQ2: 제미나이의 프레젠테이션 기능 대신 '구글 슬라이드 생성기'를 사용해야 하는 특별한 이유가 있나요?\nA2: 네, 몇 가지 명확한 이유가 있습니다.

EM 크기는 상대적 단위의 크기로 일반적으로 1000 또는 2048 단위로 설정됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n좌표 공간을 지정했으면 폰트 메트릭을 결정할 차례입니다. 폰트 메트릭은 **폰트 모양이 좌표 내에 어디에 표시될지**를 결정하는 아주 중요한 지표입니다. 메트릭이 없으면 글자가 좌표 공간 내에서 멋대로 배치되어 글자가 삐뚤빼뚤하게 표시될 수 있습니다. 아래는 주요 폰트 메트릭에 대한 설명과 이해를 돕기 위한 그림입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text2.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n| 요소           | 설명                                                                                                        |\r\r\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\r\n| **EM Square**  | 글꼴의 모든 문자가 설계되는 가상의 좌표 공간<br>모든 글자는 이 가상의 정사각형 안에서 상대 좌표로 설계된다. |\r\r\n| **Baseline**   | 글자가 놓이는 기준 선                                                                                       |\r\r\n| **x-height**   | 소문자 ‘x’의 높이(소문자 기준 높이)                                                                        |\r\r\n| **Cap height** | 대문자 기준 높이(‘M’, ‘H’ 등)                                                                              |\r\r\n| **Ascender**   | ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘k’처럼 위로 튀어나온 부분의 최대 높이                                                            |\r\r\n| **Descender**  | ‘g’, ‘p’, ‘y’처럼 아래로 내려가는 부분의 깊이                                                               |\r\r\n\r\r\n즉, 폰트의 모든 글자는 Baseline을 기준으로 Descender 만큼 아래로 나타날 수 있고, Ascender 만큼 위로 나타날 수 있습니다. 또한 EM 크기는 기준이 되는 상대적 단위의 크기이므로 Ascender와 Descender의 합이 EM 크기보다 작거나 클 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 폰트 메트릭까지 설정했으니, 폰트의 각 글자의 모양만 만들면 폰트가 만들어집니다. 아래는 예제에서 사용한 폰트 Pretendard의 메트릭 정보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 그래서 폰트 크기는 어떻게 결정되는데?\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 우리가 `font-size`로 설정한 값이 실제 폰트 크기로 설정되지 않는 이유 중 하나는 `font-size`가 이렇게 나타나도록 만들어져 있기 때문이라고 했습니다. 이에 대해 결론부터 말하자면 `font-size`는 폰트의 문자 그 자체의 높이가 아닌 **폰트의 `em-square`의 크기를 결정**짓는 속성입니다.[<sup></sup>](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 Pretendard 폰트가 `font-size`값에 따라 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지 알아봅시다. Pretendard 폰트는 2048 단위의 EM 크기에서 1949(Ascender)+494(Descender) 단위를 사용합니다. 이는 EM 크기가 `2048px`로 결정되면 폰트의 크기는 `2443(=1949+494)px`이 된다는 의미입니다.[<sup></sup>](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-253&utm_medium=web)\r\r\n\r\r\n그러면 예제의 높이를 계산해 볼까요? `font-size: 50px`이라는 뜻은 EM 크기가 `50px`로 결정되었다는 뜻이고, 이에 따라 폰트의 크기는 `59.5(≈ 2443 / 2048 * 50)px`(2x 스케일링으로 `0.5px`까지 표현 가능)로 계산됩니다. 이 값은 예제가 갖는 값과 동일하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 우리는 메트릭 정보와 `font-size`를 이용해 실제로 폰트가 몇 픽셀로 나타날지 계산할 수 있습니다!\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n폰트 크기 = (${Ascender} + ${Descender}) / ${EM 크기} \\* ${font-size}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 내가 궁금한 건 폰트가 왜 치우치냐예요.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 폰트가 왜 치우쳐 나타나는지 알기 위해 폰트의 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지를 알아봤습니다. 폰트가 치우치는 것은 이렇게 결정된 폰트 크기 내에 문자가 어떻게 배치되는지에 따라 결정되는 것입니다. 우리는 폰트 메트릭에서 문자가 놓일 기준선과 문자의 기준 높이, 그리고 위/아래 최대 높이를 알 수 있었습니다. 이를 활용하면 문자가 위/아래에 얼마 만큼의 여백을 두고 나타날지(수직으로 어디에 정렬될지) 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 글자의 높이와 여백을 쉽게 측정하기 위해 예제의 `font-size`를 `51px`로 조정해서 폰트의 크기가 정수(`61px`)로 결정되도록 조정하겠습니다.[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/OPVPqax)\r\r\n\r\r\n![text4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text4.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 대문자 M의 크기와 위/아래 여백의 크기를 계산해 봅시다. 앞서 수식에서 `(${Ascender} + ${Descender})`을 계산하고자 하는 메트릭 값으로 치환하면 원하는 계산 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈ ${Cap height} / ${EM 크기} * ${font-size}\r\r\n1448 / 2048 * 51 =

그림에 따라 세 브라우저 모두 환경 무관하게 폰트 크기가 `61px`, 대문자 M의 크기는 1x 환경에서 `37px`, 2x 환경에서 `36.5px`로 동일하게 계산된 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 브라우저마다 각 환경에 따른 위/아래 여백 계산 결과에 차이를 보여 동일한 폰트에 동일한 문자라 할지라도 환경에 따라 텍스트가 시각적으로 중앙에 정렬되어 보일 수도, 그렇지 않을 수도 있음을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이번 예제는 그래도 폰트의 크기도, 대문자 M의 크기도 홀수로 계산되고 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 짝수여서 어떻게든 중앙에 나타날 수 있는 형태였습니다. 하지만, 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 홀수라면 어떻게 될까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n이번에는 `font-size`를 `11px`로 설정해서 폰트 크기는 홀수(`13px`), 대문자 M의 크기는 짝수(`8px`)로 나타내 보도록 하겠습니다.[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/azOOKEE) 먼저, 변경된 값과 폰트 메트릭에 따른 크기를 다시 계산해 봅시다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈

있어서 중앙 정렬이 잘 되어 보이지만, 1x 환경에서는 픽셀을 반으로 나누는 게 불가능해 한 쪽으로 `1px` 치우쳐 보일 수밖에 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 확인한 바와 같이 텍스트는 텍스트를 보는 환경에 따라 폰트 크기 내에서 수직 중앙 정렬이 될 수도, 아닐 수도 있다는 사실을 알았습니다. 다양한 CSS 수직 정렬 속성(`vertical-align`, `align-items`, `justify-content` 등)은 폰트 크기 내 텍스트를 정렬하는 것이 아니고 일정한 기준에 따라 폰트 자체의 위치를 조정하는 것으로 앞서 설명 드렸던 **치우쳐 보이는 이유**에서 벗어날 수 없습니다. 따라서 이것이 진정 수직 중앙 정렬한 텍스트가 치우쳐 보이는 이유입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n텍스트는 환경에 따라 정렬되어 보인다는 점이 다르다 해도 작게는 0.5px에서 크게는 2px 정도 치우쳐 보이게 됩니다. 이 정도 차이가 일반적으로 큰 문제를 일으키지는 않지만, 이 차이가 굉장히 중요한 문제를 일으키는 때가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없는 것 일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n꼭 그렇지만은 않습니다. **보편적인 환경에 대해 모든 문제를 해결하는 것은 어렵지만, 필요한 때에 필요한 곳에서는 제한적으로 대응할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### **실용적인 대응 방법**\r\r\n\r\r\n1. **CSS transform 활용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/OPVVwgR?editors=1100)\r\r\n   텍스트가 시각적으로 정확히 중앙에 보이도록 미세하게 조정이 필요한 경우 `transform` 속성을 사용하여 텍스트 위치를 조정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .vertically-centered-text {\r\r\n   display: flex;\r\r\n   align-items: center;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-0.5px); /_ 상황에 따라 값 조정 _/\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n2. **폰트별 보정 값 적용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/WbvvKzZ?editors=1400)\r\r\n   특정 폰트와 크기에서 반복적으로 발생하는 정렬 문제가 있다면, 해당 조합에 대한 보정 값을 미리 계산하여 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .apple-sd-gothic-neo {\r\r\n   font-family: 'Apple SD Gothic Neo';\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   .segoe-ui {\r\r\n   font-family: SegoeUI;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-3px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n3. **텍스트 대신 아이콘이나 SVG 사용하기**\r\r\n   정확한 수직 정렬이 매우 중요한 UI 요소(예: 버튼의 아이콘)의 경우, 텍스트 대신 SVG나 아이콘 폰트를 사용하면 더 정확한 배치가 가능합니다.\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n4. **텍스트 박스에 패딩/마진 추가하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/pvJJZQK?editors=1400%3C/sup%3E)\r\r\n   텍스트를 담은 요소에 적절한 패딩/마진을 추가하면 미세한 정렬 차이를 눈에 덜 띄게 할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   /_ margin을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-margin {\r\r\n   margin-top: -3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   /_ padding을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-padding {\r\r\n   padding-bottom: 3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n5. **브라우저 환경 감지 및 조건부 스타일 적용하기**[<sup></sup>](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/EajjpJB)\r\r\n   특정 브라우저나 픽셀 밀도에 따라 다른 보정 값을 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```js\r\r\n   // 브라우저와 픽셀 밀도에 따른 보정 클래스 추가\r\r\n   const element = document.querySelector('.text');\r\r\n\r\r\n   if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Chrome')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('chrome-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Safari')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('safari-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Firefox')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('firefox-adjustment');\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   element.classList.add(`pixelratio-${window.devicePixelRatio}x-adjustment`);\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-2px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n<br>\r\r\n## 결론\r\r\n\r\r\n폰트는 디자인적인 이유와 기술적인 제약으로 인해 완벽하게 수직 중앙 정렬되어 보이지 않을 수 있습니다. 이는 폰트 메트릭의 특성, 브라우저의 렌더링 방식, 픽셀 밀도 등 여러 요인이 복합적으로 작용한 결과입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n완벽한 수직 중앙 정렬을 위한 마법 같은 해결책은 없지만, 폰트의 동작 방식을 이해하고 특정 상황에 맞는 보정을 적용한다면 시각적으로 더 만족스러운 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n무엇보다 중요한 것은 이러한 차이가 '오류'가 아니라 폰트와 텍스트 렌더링의 본질적인 특성임을 이해하는 것입니다. 보통의 경우 이 미세한 차이는 사용자 경험에 큰 영향을 주지 않으므로, 지나친 완벽주의보다는 전체적인 디자인 일관성과 사용성에 집중하는 것이 바람직합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 NCUI개발팀은 NCUI 컴포넌트 라이브러리를 통해 NHN Cloud 콘솔 구현 시 더 쉽고 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있도록 돕고 있습니다. 이번 글은 그 과정에서 얻은 고민과

EM 크기는 상대적 단위의 크기로 일반적으로 1000 또는 2048 단위로 설정됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n좌표 공간을 지정했으면 폰트 메트릭을 결정할 차례입니다. 폰트 메트릭은 **폰트 모양이 좌표 내에 어디에 표시될지**를 결정하는 아주 중요한 지표입니다. 메트릭이 없으면 글자가 좌표 공간 내에서 멋대로 배치되어 글자가 삐뚤빼뚤하게 표시될 수 있습니다. 아래는 주요 폰트 메트릭에 대한 설명과 이해를 돕기 위한 그림입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text2.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n| 요소           | 설명                                                                                                        |\r\r\n| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\r\n| **EM Square**  | 글꼴의 모든 문자가 설계되는 가상의 좌표 공간\n모든 글자는 이 가상의 정사각형 안에서 상대 좌표로 설계된다. |\r\r\n| **Baseline**   | 글자가 놓이는 기준 선                                                                                       |\r\r\n| **x-height**   | 소문자 ‘x’의 높이(소문자 기준 높이)                                                                        |\r\r\n| **Cap height** | 대문자 기준 높이(‘M’, ‘H’ 등)                                                                              |\r\r\n| **Ascender**   | ‘b’, ‘d’, ‘k’처럼 위로 튀어나온 부분의 최대 높이                                                            |\r\r\n| **Descender**  | ‘g’, ‘p’, ‘y’처럼 아래로 내려가는 부분의 깊이                                                               |\r\r\n\r\r\n즉, 폰트의 모든 글자는 Baseline을 기준으로 Descender 만큼 아래로 나타날 수 있고, Ascender 만큼 위로 나타날 수 있습니다. 또한 EM 크기는 기준이 되는 상대적 단위의 크기이므로 Ascender와 Descender의 합이 EM 크기보다 작거나 클 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 폰트 메트릭까지 설정했으니, 폰트의 각 글자의 모양만 만들면 폰트가 만들어집니다. 아래는 예제에서 사용한 폰트 Pretendard의 메트릭 정보입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![text3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text3.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 그래서 폰트 크기는 어떻게 결정되는데?\r\r\n\r\r\n앞서 우리가 `font-size`로 설정한 값이 실제 폰트 크기로 설정되지 않는 이유 중 하나는 `font-size`가 이렇게 나타나도록 만들어져 있기 때문이라고 했습니다. 이에 대해 결론부터 말하자면 `font-size`는 폰트의 문자 그 자체의 높이가 아닌 **폰트의 `em-square`의 크기를 결정**짓는 속성입니다.[](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#font-size-props)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 Pretendard 폰트가 `font-size`값에 따라 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지 알아봅시다. Pretendard 폰트는 2048 단위의 EM 크기에서 1949(Ascender)+494(Descender) 단위를 사용합니다. 이는 EM 크기가 `2048px`로 결정되면 폰트의 크기는 `2443(=1949+494)px`이 된다는 의미입니다.[](https://iamvdo.me/en/blog/css-font-metrics-line-height-and-vertical-align?utm_source=CSS-Weekly&utm_campaign=Issue-253&utm_medium=web)\r\r\n\r\r\n그러면 예제의 높이를 계산해 볼까요? `font-size: 50px`이라는 뜻은 EM 크기가 `50px`로 결정되었다는 뜻이고, 이에 따라 폰트의 크기는 `59.5(≈ 2443 / 2048 * 50)px`(2x 스케일링으로 `0.5px`까지 표현 가능)로 계산됩니다. 이 값은 예제가 갖는 값과 동일하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 우리는 메트릭 정보와 `font-size`를 이용해 실제로 폰트가 몇 픽셀로 나타날지 계산할 수 있습니다!\r\r\n\r\r\n```\r\r\n폰트 크기 = (${Ascender} + ${Descender}) / ${EM 크기} \\* ${font-size}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 내가 궁금한 건 폰트가 왜 치우치냐예요.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 폰트가 왜 치우쳐 나타나는지 알기 위해 폰트의 크기가 어떻게 결정되는지를 알아봤습니다. 폰트가 치우치는 것은 이렇게 결정된 폰트 크기 내에 문자가 어떻게 배치되는지에 따라 결정되는 것입니다. 우리는 폰트 메트릭에서 문자가 놓일 기준선과 문자의 기준 높이, 그리고 위/아래 최대 높이를 알 수 있었습니다. 이를 활용하면 문자가 위/아래에 얼마 만큼의 여백을 두고 나타날지(수직으로 어디에 정렬될지) 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n먼저 글자의 높이와 여백을 쉽게 측정하기 위해 예제의 `font-size`를 `51px`로 조정해서 폰트의 크기가 정수(`61px`)로 결정되도록 조정하겠습니다.[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/OPVPqax)\r\r\n\r\r\n![text4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text4.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n이제 대문자 M의 크기와 위/아래 여백의 크기를 계산해 봅시다. 앞서 수식에서 `(${Ascender} + ${Descender})`을 계산하고자 하는 메트릭 값으로 치환하면 원하는 계산 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈ ${Cap height} / ${EM 크기} * ${font-size}\r\r\n1448 / 2048 * 51 = 36.05859375(px)\r\r\n// 아래 여백의 크기 ≈ ${Descender} / ${EM 크기} * ${font-size}\r\r\n494 / 2048 * 51 = 12.30175781(px)\r\r\n// 위 여백의 크기 ≈(${Ascender} - ${Cap height}) / ${EM 크기} _ ${font-size}\r\r\n(1949 - 1448) / 2048 _ 51 = 12.47607422(px)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n아래는 실제 화면에 나타나는 대문자 M의 크기과 위/아래 여백의 크기를 확인할 수 있는 그림입니다.(2x 환경의 `pt` 단위는 스케일링된 픽셀 크기입니다.)\r\r\n\r\r\n| Chrome                              | Chrome(2x)

그림에 따라 세 브라우저 모두 환경 무관하게 폰트 크기가 `61px`, 대문자 M의 크기는 1x 환경에서 `37px`, 2x 환경에서 `36.5px`로 동일하게 계산된 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러나 브라우저마다 각 환경에 따른 위/아래 여백 계산 결과에 차이를 보여 동일한 폰트에 동일한 문자라 할지라도 환경에 따라 텍스트가 시각적으로 중앙에 정렬되어 보일 수도, 그렇지 않을 수도 있음을 알 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이번 예제는 그래도 폰트의 크기도, 대문자 M의 크기도 홀수로 계산되고 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 짝수여서 어떻게든 중앙에 나타날 수 있는 형태였습니다. 하지만, 위/아래 여백으로 사용될 너비가 홀수라면 어떻게 될까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n이번에는 `font-size`를 `11px`로 설정해서 폰트 크기는 홀수(`13px`), 대문자 M의 크기는 짝수(`8px`)로 나타내 보도록 하겠습니다.[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/full/azOOKEE) 먼저, 변경된 값과 폰트 메트릭에 따른 크기를 다시 계산해 봅시다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```js\r\r\n// 대문자 M의 크기 ≈ ${Cap

- ${Cap height}) / ${EM 크기} _ ${font-size}\r\r\n(1949 - 1448) / 2048 _ 11 = 2.69091797(px)\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n| Chrome                                                             | Chrome(2x)

|\r\r\n|![text7_chrome.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text7chrome.png)| ![text7_chrome2.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/text7chrome2.png) |\r\r\n\r\r\n대문자 M의 크기가 짝수(`8px`)로 결정됨에 따라 위/아래 여백으로 사용 가능한 크기가 홀수(`5px`)로 결정됩니다. 그러나 2x 환경에서는 `.5px`까지 렌더링할 수 있어서 중앙 정렬이 잘 되어 보이지만, 1x 환경에서는 픽셀을 반으로 나누는 게 불가능해 한 쪽으로 `1px` 치우쳐 보일 수밖에 없습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n지금까지 확인한 바와 같이 텍스트는 텍스트를 보는 환경에 따라 폰트 크기 내에서 수직 중앙 정렬이 될 수도, 아닐 수도 있다는 사실을 알았습니다. 다양한 CSS 수직 정렬 속성(`vertical-align`, `align-items`, `justify-content` 등)은 폰트 크기 내 텍스트를 정렬하는 것이 아니고 일정한 기준에 따라 폰트 자체의 위치를 조정하는 것으로 앞서 설명 드렸던 **치우쳐 보이는 이유**에서 벗어날 수 없습니다. 따라서 이것이 진정 수직 중앙 정렬한 텍스트가 치우쳐 보이는 이유입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없나요?\r\r\n\r\r\n텍스트는 환경에 따라 정렬되어 보인다는 점이 다르다 해도 작게는 0.5px에서 크게는 2px 정도 치우쳐 보이게 됩니다. 이 정도 차이가 일반적으로 큰 문제를 일으키지는 않지만, 이 차이가 굉장히 중요한 문제를 일으키는 때가 있을 수 있습니다. 그러면 우리는 아무것도 할 수 없는 것 일까요?\r\r\n\r\r\n꼭 그렇지만은 않습니다. **보편적인 환경에 대해 모든 문제를 해결하는 것은 어렵지만, 필요한 때에 필요한 곳에서는 제한적으로 대응할 수 있습니다.**\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### **실용적인 대응 방법**\r\r\n\r\r\n1. **CSS transform 활용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/OPVVwgR?editors=1100)\r\r\n   텍스트가 시각적으로 정확히 중앙에 보이도록 미세하게 조정이 필요한 경우 `transform` 속성을 사용하여 텍스트 위치를 조정할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .vertically-centered-text {\r\r\n   display: flex;\r\r\n   align-items: center;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-0.5px); /_ 상황에 따라 값 조정 _/\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n2. **폰트별 보정 값 적용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/WbvvKzZ?editors=1400)\r\r\n   특정 폰트와 크기에서 반복적으로 발생하는 정렬 문제가 있다면, 해당 조합에 대한 보정 값을 미리 계산하여 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .apple-sd-gothic-neo {\r\r\n   font-family: 'Apple SD Gothic Neo';\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   .segoe-ui {\r\r\n   font-family: SegoeUI;\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-3px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n3. **텍스트 대신 아이콘이나 SVG 사용하기**\r\r\n   정확한 수직 정렬이 매우 중요한 UI 요소(예: 버튼의 아이콘)의 경우, 텍스트 대신 SVG나 아이콘 폰트를 사용하면 더 정확한 배치가 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n4. **텍스트 박스에 패딩/마진 추가하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/pvJJZQK?editors=1400%3C/sup%3E)\r\r\n   텍스트를 담은 요소에 적절한 패딩/마진을 추가하면 미세한 정렬 차이를 눈에 덜 띄게 할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   /_ margin을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-margin {\r\r\n   margin-top: -3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   /_ padding을 이용한 정렬 보정 _/\r\r\n   .align-with-padding {\r\r\n   padding-bottom: 3px;\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n5. **브라우저 환경 감지 및 조건부 스타일 적용하기**[](https://codepen.io/jajugoguma/pen/EajjpJB)\r\r\n   특정 브라우저나 픽셀 밀도에 따라 다른 보정 값을 적용할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```js\r\r\n   // 브라우저와 픽셀 밀도에 따른 보정 클래스 추가\r\r\n   const element = document.querySelector('.text');\r\r\n\r\r\n   if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Chrome')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('chrome-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Safari')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('safari-adjustment');\r\r\n   } else if (navigator.userAgent.includes('Firefox')) {\r\r\n   element.classList.add('firefox-adjustment');\r\r\n   }\r\r\n\r\r\n   element.classList.add(`pixelratio-${window.devicePixelRatio}x-adjustment`);\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n    ```css\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .chrome-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .safari-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-1x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-1.5px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n   .firefox-adjustment.pixelratio-2x-adjustment {\r\r\n   transform: translateY(-2px);\r\r\n   }\r\r\n    ```\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n## 결론\r\r\n\r\r\n폰트는 디자인적인 이유와 기술적인 제약으로 인해 완벽하게 수직 중앙 정렬되어 보이지 않을 수 있습니다. 이는 폰트 메트릭의 특성, 브라우저의 렌더링 방식, 픽셀 밀도 등 여러 요인이 복합적으로 작용한 결과입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n완벽한 수직 중앙 정렬을 위한 마법 같은 해결책은 없지만, 폰트의 동작 방식을 이해하고 특정 상황에 맞는 보정을 적용한다면 시각적으로 더 만족스러운 결과를 얻을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n무엇보다 중요한 것은 이러한 차이가 '오류'가 아니라 폰트와 텍스트 렌더링의 본질적인 특성임을 이해하는 것입니다. 보통의 경우 이 미세한 차이는 사용자 경험에 큰 영향을 주지 않으므로, 지나친 완벽주의보다는 전체적인 디자인 일관성과 사용성에 집중하는 것이 바람직합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN Cloud의 NCUI개발팀은 NCUI 컴포넌트 라이브러리를 통해 NHN Cloud 콘솔 구현 시 더 쉽고 빠르게 UI를 구현할 수 있도록 돕고 있습니다. 이번 글은 그 과정에서 얻은 고민과 작은 팁을 공유한 것으로, 많은 분들이 앞으로 개발하시는 데 참고가 되었으면 좋겠습니다. 긴 글을 읽어 주셔서 감사합니다! \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[![NHN Cloud_meetup

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에, 우리와 공동투자도 많이 하고, 나랑 개인적으로도 친한 다른 투자자와 한국의 초기 AI 스타트업과 창업가들에 대해 이야기할 기회가 있었다. 요새 한국의 초기 AI 시장 분위기는 어떤지, AI 스타트업을 만드는 창업가들은 어떤 사람들인지, 그리고 한국은 이 혼란스러운 시장에서 어떤 플레이를 해야 하는지와 같은 흥미로운 내용이었다.\n우리는 초기 회사들을 많이 만난다. 그리고 평균적으로 매달 한두 개의 신규 회사에 투자한다. 요샌 아마도 10개 회사 중 7개는 AI 조미료가 가미된 스타트업이고, 미팅은 대부분 “AI 네이티브” , “AI 퍼스트” , “AI 기반” , “AI driven”으로 시작하는데, 이런 피칭을 너무 많이 듣고, 비슷한 생각과 비슷한 말을 하는 창업가를 너무 많이 만나니까 이제 농담 반 진담 반으로 우리 팀 동료분들에게 AI 회사 피칭 하나만 더 들으면 토할 것 같다고 말할 정도이다.\n이 중 아주 좋은 회사도 가끔 있다. 정말로 AI가 스타트업의 생산성을 높여주고, 이렇게 만든 소프트웨어가 고객들의 문제를 해결해 주는, product market fitting이 제대로 된 제품도 있는데, 이게 되면 돈을 벌 수 있는 사업이 된다. 하지만, 아직 이런 회사는 소수이고 대부분의 창업가들은 그냥 AI 조미료를 먹으면서 살고 있는 것 같고, 비슷한 사업을 하는 미국의 어떤 회사처럼 1년 만에 데카콘을 만들겠다는 의지만 강하다.\nAI 회사들의 강점은 명확하다. 그리고 아주 파워풀 한 강점이다. Web 2.0의 시대가 시작되고, 이후에 클라우드 컴퓨팅이 대세가 되면서 창업의 비용과 문턱이 현저하게 낮아졌는데, 물리적인 서버를 구매하지 않고 사용하는 만큼만 지불하는 클라우드, 소프트웨어를 구매하지 않고 무료로 사용할 수 있는 오픈 소스 코드의 대세, 비싼 마케팅보단 거의 무료로 하면서 더 큰 파급력을 만들 수 있는 소셜 미디어 마케팅 등이 당시에 “창업은 비싸다”는 개념을 완전히 박살 냈다. 그리고 실제로 우리도 이후에 정말 많은 질 좋은 창업가들을 만날 수 있었다. AI로 인해 이 창업의 장벽이 다시 한번 내려가고 있고, 이에 따라 창업에 대해서 고민하던 아주 똑똑하고 수준 높은 창업가들이 창업의 첫발을 내딛는 결정을 과거 대비 쉽게 하고 있다는 걸 요새 매일매일 체감하고 있다. 이제 대부분의 노가다를 AI가 완전히상당히 많이 대체할 수 있는 수준까지 올라왔고, 우선순위는 높지 않지만, 시간과 자원이 많이 소요되는 업무에 이런 AI 대체 효과가 가장 두드러지게 보이는 것 같다.\n그런데 이게 좋기만 한 걸까? 장점이 너무 많지만, 여기에 큰 함정도 있다. 바로 창업을 너무 쉽게 생각하는 부작용이다. 창업의 장벽이 낮아진 것과 모두 다 유니콘을 만들 수 있는 건 여전히 완전히 별개이고, 솔직히 아예 상관없는데, 이 두 가지가 같다고 착각하는 창업가들이 꽤 많다. 전에는 5명의 엔지니어가 필요했다면, 이제 이보다 더 적은 팀으로 괜찮은 제품을 만들 수 있긴 하지만, 결국 AI로 만든 이 제품을 고객에게 팔아서 돈을 버는 비즈니스를 만드는 건 여전히 어렵다. 오히려 훨씬 더 어려워졌다고 생각하는 게, 이제 비슷한 제품을 똑같은 AI 모델로 누구나 만들기 때문에 고객의 기대 수준은 더 높아졌고, 이들의 지갑을 여는 건 과거 그 어느 때보다 어려워졌다.\n그리고 왜 이런 생각을 쉽게 하는지 모르겠지만, AI 기반의 사업을 하면 창업 첫날부터 글로벌 사업을 만들 수 있다고 생각하는데 이건 정말 큰 착각이다. 영어로 된 UI와 글로벌 제품과 비슷한 UX는 과거보다 쉽게 만들 수 있는 건 맞지만, 결국 외국 시장에서 사업을 하려면 외국 고객들을 알아야 하고, B2B 사업이면 외국 기업 고객들에게 영업해야 하고, 그 나라에서 결국엔 팀을 만들어야 한다. AI 사업이든 아니든 그냥 똑같이 힘들고 어려운 해외 확장 과정을 거쳐야 한다. AI first 사업이라서 첫날부터 글로벌 사업을 할 수 있다는 창업가들에게 왜 그렇게 생각하는지 물어보면, 그냥 실체가 없는 “AI native 사업이기 때문입니다.”라는 말을 하는데 이분들은 AI 조미료를 너무 많이 처먹은 것 같다.\n그리고 또 한 가지는, 이 조미료로 인해 밸류에이션이 너무 높아졌다. 비슷한 팀인데, AI로 사업을 하는 팀은 오프라인 사업을 하는 팀보다 자신에게 매기는 밸류가 말도 안 되게 높고, 역시 물어보면 해외에서 비슷한 사업을 하는 회사의 밸류에이션이 그 근거이다.\nAI 자체는 나는 대단하다고 생각한다. AI 자체에는 거품이 별로 없지만, AI 조미료가 만드는 밸류에이션과 창업가들의 허세에는 거품이 너무 많이 껴 있다고 생각한다. 이런 AI 난리 지랄을 잘 구분하고, 기대 수준을 모두 잘 관리하지 않으면 결국 벤처 생태계에 또 한 차례의 위기가 올 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 블로그를 통해 올해 내가 가장 많이 듣는 팟캐스트가 엘리트 운동선수들 인터뷰라고 했는데, 운동선수들 팟캐스트 외에 또 자주 듣는 건 전직 특수부대 출신 군인들의(미군) 팟캐스트다. 일단 미국의 엘리트 운동선수와 특수부대원의 팟캐스트를 들을 때마다 가장 놀라운 건, 말을 너무 논리적으로 잘 한다는 건데, 내가 아는 한국의 운동선수와 군인들과 비교하면 너무 차이가 난다. 물론, 말을 잘하니까 팟캐스트도 하고 사업도 하겠지만, 이건 미국의 교육과 환경의 힘이 크다고 생각한다.\n건강, 노화, 장수에 대한 전문가 중 한 명인 앤드류 후버만의 팟캐스트 Huberman Lab에서 네이비씰 군인 출신의 인플루언서이자 사업가인 DJ Shipley를 인터뷰했다. ‘How to Make Yourself Unbreakable’이라는 다소 자극적인 이름의 인터뷰이지만, 내용은 너무너무 좋다. 팟캐스트를 듣고 난 후에 나도 DJ의 습관, 루틴, 사고, 태도를 그대로 따라 해서 unbreakable이 되고 싶을 정도였다.\n일단 전 세계에서 가장 빡센 훈련을 거치는 특수부대 중의 특수부대 네이비씰 출신이라는 사실만으로 이분은 나의 존경을 받을 자격이 있다. 나는 정신력(=멘탈)과 체력(=피시컬)이 별개가 아니라 하나라고 생각하고, 정신이 몸을 지배하는 게 아니라 몸이 정신을 지배한다고 믿는 사람이라서 일단 일반인이 상상도 할 수 없는 육체적 훈련을 거치고, 그 악명높은 BUD/S(Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL) 6개월 훈련을 통과해서 네이비씰이 된 군인들을 기본적으로 존경한다. 또한, 내가 아는 대부분의 육체가 강한 사람들은 정신력도 강하기 때문에 더욱더 특수부대원들을 존경한다.\n이 팟캐스트에서 계속 언급되는 내용은 “반복” , “루틴” , “책임”이다. 특히 DJ의 루틴은 10년 이상 매일 같은 루틴을 나름 엄격하게 반복하는 나 같은 사람이 들어도 아주 짜증 날 정도로 엄격하다. 이런 사람과 같이 사는 이분의 가족이 존경스러운데, 종교보다 더 종교다운 루틴을 이분은 오랜 시간 동안 변함없이 매일 반복하고 있다. 매일 같은 시간에 기상하고, 아침마다 같은 루틴을 반복하고, 거의 같은 시간에 퇴근하고, 저녁마다 같은 루틴을 반복하고, 같은 시간에 잔다. 조금이라도 이 루틴이 어그러지면, 하루를 완전히 망치고, 하루를 망치면, 일주일을 망치고, 일주일을 망치면, 한 달이 힘들고,,,결국엔 인생이 불행해지고 정리가 안 되기 때문에, DJ의 가족은 정말 급한 위기 상황이 아니면 이 루틴을 절대로 방해하지 않는다고 한다.\n이분의 루틴은 내가 완벽하게 따라 하기엔 무리지만, 배울 점이 상당히 많다고 생각했다. 네이비씰이 전시에 지키는 그 엄격한 루틴을 제대한 후에도 인생에 그대로 적용하고 있고, 이런 삶을 살면 남들보다 더 앞설 수 있다는 건 누구가 잘 알지만, 또 동시에 이런 삶을 모두가 다 살 수 없다는 것도 잘 알고 있다. 그런데 이런 루틴은 이분의 삶의 극히 일부만 반영하고, 실제 배울 점은 이런 루틴을 기반으로 자신을 unbreakable 하게 만들 수 있는 습관, 태도, 사고방식인데, 이런 것들이 이 팟캐스트의 핵심이다.\n인터뷰에서 DJ가 “내가 어떤 사람이 될 진, 그 누구도 아닌, 바로 내가 결정한다.”라는 너무나 당연한 말을 했는데, 나는 이 말이 제일 맘에 들었고 이거 하나만 제대로 해도 성공적인 인생을 살 수 있다고 믿는다. 그리고 다음과 같은 거창하지 않은, 평범한 예시를 들었다. 우리 주변에 항상 있는데, 매일 아침 늦게 일어나서 허둥지둥 회사에 미친 듯이 뛰어오고, 이 와중에 지하철에서 지갑이나 폰을 분실하고, 일에 집중 못 해서 매일 깨지는,,,그런 사람들이 있다. 이들은 스스로에게 “왜 내 인생은 항상 이럴까?” , “왜 나는 항상 여유가 없을까?”라면서 자책한다.\n근데 정말 왜 그럴까? 이런 사람들은 왜 항상 이렇게 살까? 간단하다. 본인이 인생을 그렇게 만들었기 때문이다. 그리고 계속 이러면 평생 지각하고 평생 여유 없는 인생을 살 것이다. 본인이 스스로 이런 사람이 되는 결정을 했기 때문이다. 자신을 진지하게 대하고, 스스로의 선택과 행동에 책임을 져야 한다. 그리고, 이건 네이비씰이 아니라도 누구나 다 할 수 있다.",
