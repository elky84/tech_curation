        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2024.10.21 registry release, 2024-10-18 tool release, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout October. This release adds support for Azure universal packages as a binary caching provider and other minor improvements.\nCppCon Talk on Managing C++ Dependencies\nI also gave a talk at CppCon about 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them. Here is a video recording of the talk:\n\nIn particular, I talked about several vcpkg features that can help:\nSupporting build from source as a fallback without sacrificing the build-time savings of binary dependency acquisition.\nUpgrading dependencies as a set using baselines, rather than managing them individually, to avoid version conflicts / diamond problems.\nHow to continue working in an offline build environment using asset caching.\nGetting any open-source libraries installed and working with your project with minimal effort, while also automatically resolving transitive dependencies.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,490 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n7 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n422 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n53 contributors made commits (not counting the vcpkg maintainers).\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,400 forks and 23,200 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2024.10.21 release)\nThe following changes were made in October:\nAdded support for Azure universal packages as a binary caching provider (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1491).\nOther minor improvements.\nDocumentation changes\nAdded reference documentation for binary caching with Azure universal packages as a back-end (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#414).\nUpdated links, fixed typos, and added some clarifications to usage examples for vcpkg maintainer functions (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#381, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nClarified how default features should be used for vcpkg ports in maintainer guide (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#410).\nUpdated docs for vcpkg supported host environments (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#415).\nImprovements to example for packaging GitHub repos in vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#405, thanks @andre-nguyen!).\nFixed nuget command for setapikey in Set up a vcpkg binary cache using a NuGet feed tutorial (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#381, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,361\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,261\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,261\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,281\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,960\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,307\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,276\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,336\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,209\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,132\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,635\n\n\nx64-android\n1,713\n\n\narm64-android\n1,685\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/fleet/2024/11/default-bundled-plugins-in-fleet/",
        "pubDate": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 14:06:26 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Recently, we announced the public rollout of the Fleet Plugins SDK – a step that finally allows plugins to be created and shared among the Fleet community at large.\nBelieve it or not, this did not mark the very beginning of extensibility in Fleet. Fleet has always featured a variety of bundled plugins (currently upwards of 50!) to streamline your coding process.\nWe designed Fleet to be minimalist and focus on the essentials of programming so that you can avoid extension fatigue. Does this mean Fleet users should shy away from plugins? Of course not! We’re still working on finalizing Fleet’s extensibility program, but you can already make use of its existing bundled plugins.\nThese plugins can be selectively added to and removed from your Fleet workspace, or even marked as required for a given workspace. Here’s a quick rundown of how you can manage bundled plugins in Fleet.\nFleet’s default set of bundled plugins can be roughly broken down into the following categories:\nIntegrated tools and frameworks\nAI features\nLanguage-specific support\nCustomization\nRemote development\nIntegrated Tools and Frameworks\nFleet comes bundled with plugins supporting a plethora of integrated tools and frameworks, including Amper, Docker, Git, Gradle, Maven, and a whole host of others. Here’s the full list at a glance:\n\n\n\n\nWorthy of special mention is Amper, a JetBrains tool designed to provide a smoother experience with project configuration and toolability when working with Kotlin Multiplatform.\nMany of these plugins will require you to have Smart Mode running, but there are some (such as Prettier) that you can use even when running Fleet as a lightweight text editor.\nPlugins Supporting AI Features\nHere’s a quick glance at all the languages for which AI plugins are offered in Fleet by default. Keep in mind that this is just the beginning – we’ve got plenty of additional features on the way for even more languages.\n\n\n\n\nThis is in addition to Fleet’s support for AI Completion and Grazie – JetBrains’ AI writing companion for smoothing out your grammar and style.\nLanguage Support\nFrom a language standpoint, Fleet has always been highly versatile. It supports most major languages straight out of the box – no matter how simple or in-depth your project may be. Fleet analyzes your code to automatically detect your project configuration, including which language you’re coding in.\nTo get the most out of each language when Smart Mode is enabled (such as code completion, error detection, documentation, code reformatting, and navigation to usages and definitions), you can make use of pre-installed plugins for any the following languages:\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nThe Fleet user experience is becoming ever more customizable. Members of the Fleet community can publish custom color theme plugins, but there are a few bundled plugins for this as well. The Grey Theme comes pre-installed, for instance, allowing you to tweak the look and feel of Fleet.\nFleet’s potential for customization does not stop at mere aesthetics. If you happen to be migrating from VSCode, the VSCode Keymap plugin will let you stick to the shortcuts you’re used to. As of the 1.41 release, Fleet gives you even more keymap options, including IntelliJ IDEA Classic, Emacs, Sublime Text, and Eclipse.\nThose who want to take things a step further with custom language support can use the TextMate plugin. This plugin makes it possible to add TextMate bundles – for example, in cases where you need code highlighting while Smart Mode is off or while coding in a language that isn’t supported in Fleet.\nRemote Development\nFleet has built-in support for remote development. When you’re on the go, you can use your local machine as a thin client while letting a more powerful machine at your home or office handle more resource-intensive tasks.\nFleet provides this out of the box, in contrast to VS Code, which requires you to install and configure extensions before you can use remote development features.\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to add more to Fleet’s expandability program.",

Below is a brief overview of the major features and bug fixes that will be included in CLion 2024.3 and are already available in Beta.\nThe key features\nThroughout the 2024.3 EAP, we’ve added a variety of features for CLion Nova, embedded\ndevelopment, debugging, and more. Here are the most important ones.\nCLion Nova\nSome editor-related features, such as the call hierarchy, the gutter icon for recursive calls, and the Quick Definition popup have improved the user experience when working with CLion Nova.\nThe IDE frontend and backend improvements have significantly reduced CLion Nova’s memory footprint. This is particularly evident when handling large projects like Chromium.\nPredefined code styles from other projects allow you to choose from LLVM, Google, Qt, GNU, and more.\nEmbedded development\nThe Debug Servers configuration option helps you streamline the process of configuring debugging for embedded and remote development.\nSupport for debugging Zephyr West applications makes it easy to configure and run West debugging sessions directly in the IDE.\nEditable peripheral register values allow you to test different configurations and device states during debugging sessions without recompiling your source code or reloading your application or board.\nCLion’s static analysis toolset now includes a significant number of MISRA C++: 2023 checks, offering recommendations for using C++17 in safety-critical systems.\nDebugger\nWith the OpenCV image viewer, you can now view a two-dimensional OpenCV array as an image while debugging. Such an image is displayed in a separate dialog with various editing options.\nThe ability to attach the debugger to an unstarted process is helpful when you need to debug an executable launched by a third-party program or a script.\nYou can now view strings with JSON, XML, or HTML data formatted according to their code style directly in the debugger.\nOther features\nUpdated cloud completion powered by JetBrains AI Assistant now offers a wider range of usage scenarios and improved multiline code suggestions.\nProject status notifications have been moved from the top of the editor to a new widget in the status bar, making them less distracting.\nIf you’re just starting with CLion, you’ll notice the improved onboarding tips, which give you a clearer picture of the IDE’s capabilities right from the start.\nThe key bug fixes\nHere are the major bug fixes that we’ve included in CLion 2024.3 Beta:\nWhen a board is not defined for a new Zephyr West project or a West executable path is incorrect, CLion now warns you of the problem and offers to fix it. You’ll get a link that will take you to the corresponding section of your project settings, where you can define the board or path.\nThe Refresh button in the Call Hierarchy tool window now works as intended when the actual call hierarchy in the source code has been changed.\nAI Assistant again highlights C/C++ code in the chat when you ask it to explain code or suggest a refactoring, for example.\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 BETA\nYour CLion team\nJetBrains\nThe Drive to Develop",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve got a few exciting updates about the Unreal Engine plugin announced in the previous blog post. \nTL;DR – we’re adding Unreal Game Sync (UGS) integration and open-sourcing the plugin. These updates are all about making the CI/CD experience smoother for Unreal Engine devs and getting the community more involved.\nUGS\nBefore diving in, let’s quickly go over what Unreal Game Sync (UGS) is for anyone who might not be familiar with it or could use a refresher. In essence, UGS is a lightweight UI for Perforce. Typically, you need to build it from source to get started, and while its graphical client is a WinForms application available only on Windows, there is a command-line interface (CLI) version for other platforms. UGS has been around for a while and is widely used by game studios working with Unreal Engine as a collaboration tool.\nFrom a CI/CD perspective, UGS provides valuable insights into a project’s status (if properly set up), such as build statuses, the ability to flag specific changelists as problematic, and more. To give a better overview, here’s a rough diagram of the components involved:\n\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few components here, with the central one being the Metadata Server. While deploying it isn’t strictly necessary, it does enable the full feature set of UGS. This is also where CI/CD systems post build information. As shown, there are different possible implementations of the Metadata Server, and it’s worth briefly discussing each:\nEpic Metadata Service. This is the original and longest-standing version of the Metadata Server. It requires Windows, IIS, and the older .NET Framework 4.6.2.\nThird-party implementation. Thanks to the open-source nature of the server, it’s possible to create your own implementation. One example is RUGS, which is much easier to set up since it supports Docker.\nHorde. Technically, this is a full-fledged automation platform recently introduced by Epic. It includes a built-in UGS Metadata Server as well as its own build system. Although it has a built-in metadata server, it doesn’t allow publishing from external sources – the transition to Horde assumes that all metadata is generated internally. Horde is a bit outside the scope of this blog post, so we’re only mentioning it for the sake of completeness.\nEntities that the build system is supposed to post to the metadata server are called “badges” in UGS terms. These badges will then show up in the CIS (continuous integration status) column in UGS. It usually looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nAs far as we know, the metadata server endpoints don’t currently have authentication. It appears that the server is intended to be used within a secure, closed network, but this is just our understanding and not an official statement.\nFor a more complete definition of UGS please refer to the official documentation.\nUGS Integration in TeamCity\nLet’s take a look at UGS integration in TeamCity. As of the most recent plugin update, we support these two scenarios:\nPublishing a badge as a build status via the Commit Status Publisher.\nPublishing an arbitrary set of badges defined in your BuildGraph script.\nThis applies to the “distributed” execution mode – a special runner mode in which the BuildGraph definition of the build is converted into a set of builds in TeamCity (build chain). For more details, please refer to our previous blog post or the plugin documentation.\nThe first scenario is pretty straightforward. You only need to configure the Commit Status Publisher build feature and set up a few required parameters.\n\n\n\n\nThe second scenario is more complex. In your script, you can define a set of badges and link them to specific nodes to be tracked. Before diving into the scripts, here’s a quick reminder of how the plugin maps BuildGraph entities to TeamCity entities:\n\nBuildGraphTeamCity\nNodeBuild step\nAgentBuild\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if your build process includes compiling an editor, the script might look like this (with unimportant details omitted):\n<Agent Name=\"Build Editor and tools\" Type=\"...\">\n    <Node Name=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Tools\" Requires=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Editor\" Requires=\"Compile Tools\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"Compile Editor\" Project=\"//UE5/Main/Samples/Games/Lyra\" Requires=\"Compile Editor\"/>\nHere, we define a badge named “Compile Editor” to track the execution of a node with the same name. In distributed BuildGraph mode, TeamCity will recognize this badge and update the build status as the process progresses.\nYou can define multiple badges to track different sets of nodes, and TeamCity will monitor all of them based on the specified dependencies:\n<Agent Name=\"Build A\" Type=\"A\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 1\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build B\" Type=\"B\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 2\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build C\" Type=\"C\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 3\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"BuildProject\" Project=\"//foo/bar/project\" Requires=\"Node A;Node B;Node C\"/>\nIn this example, there are three agents (each with a single node) that can potentially run concurrently, as they are assigned to different agents and have no dependencies on each other. Each build is tracked by a corresponding badge.\nThe badge will behave as follows:\n“Starting” – displayed as soon as any tracked dependency begins execution.\n“Success” – shown when all dependencies complete successfully.\n“Failure” – Indicated if any dependency encounters an error.\nFor complete examples, please refer to the plugin’s user guide on GitHub.\nOpen-sourcing the Plugin\nWe have received a lot of feedback since the plugin was introduced in May this year. Thank you to everyone who shared ideas for further development, submitted feature requests, or reported bugs! We’ve also been asked several times whether we’re going to open-source the plugin and, if so, when. That time is now!\nWith this step, we hope to:\nIncrease transparency and trust in the plugin’s codebase.\nEngage the community for contributions and improvements.\nSpeed up bug fixes and feature implementations.\nThe source code is now available on GitHub and the latest release is ready for download on the marketplace. We encourage you to submit feature requests, report any bugs you encounter, suggest enhancements, or fork the plugin and customize it to fit your needs.\nCheers!",

With this release, we’ve improved the IDE experience when working with multiple modules and project.yaml files, made nested completion in Amper configuration files more powerful, introduced support for Compose Resources and KSP2, improved Android release builds, and more!\nFor the full list of changes and bug fixes in Amper 0.5.0, see the release notes.\nTo get support for Amper’s latest features, use Fleet 1.42 or IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTooling support for working with modules and project files\nIn the previous update, we introduced project files for standalone Amper projects. With this release, you’ll now get additional tooling to work with these files.\nWhen working in the configuration file of a newly created module, you’ll see a warning and a quick-fix that helps you add it to the list of modules:\n\n\n\n\nWhen referencing a module that doesn’t exist yet, you can use a quick-fix to create that new module:\n\n\n\n\nImproved nested completion\nThe settings block in Amper files offers nested completion for all of the available values you can configure, letting you easily search for values even if you don’t know where in the structure they’re nested.\nTo make this even more convenient, you’ll now get this completion support even when you’re at the top level of a module file:\n\n\n\n\nCompose resources\nYou can now use Compose Multiplatform resources in standalone Amper projects, which allows you to easily access images, strings, fonts, and files in your Compose application.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure resources under settings.compose to change the package name or the visibility of the generated Res class:\nsettings:\n  compose:\n    enabled: true\n    resources:\n      packageName: com.example.app\n      exposedAccessors: true\nKotlin Symbol Processing\nThe standalone version of Amper now has support for Kotlin Symbol Processing. Many third-party libraries use KSP to generate code as part of the compilation process.\nAmper works with KSP2, so any processors used must be updated for KSP2 as well. We’re expecting most processors to make this upgrade soon, as KSP1 is deprecated and will no longer be supported in Kotlin 2.1. However, at the time of this release, you might still see some gaps in support, such as issues with native targets.\nTo add a processor to your module, use the settings.kotlin.ksp section. You can also specify the options that you want to pass to KSP here.\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\n      processorOptions:\n        room.schemaLocation: ./schema\nIn multiplatform modules, configuration in the settings block is applied to all platforms by default, including KSP processors. If you need to specify which platforms to run a KSP processor on, use a settings block with a platform qualifier:\nsettings@android:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\nAndroid release builds\nAmper can now create signed release builds of Android apps in both Gradle-based and standalone Amper projects. These builds will use R8 automatically, with minification and shrinking enabled.\nTo enable signing for release builds, use the new android.signing option in the settings block:\nsettings:\n  android:\n    signing: enabled\nYou can provide the signing details by creating a keystore.properties file in the module:\nstoreFile=/Users/example/.keystores/release.keystore\nstorePassword=store_password\nkeyAlias=alias\nkeyPassword=key_password\nThere are options available to customize R8’s obfuscation and to change the location of the properties file containing the signing details. Amper can also generate a new keystore for you if you don’t have one already.\nYou can refer to the documentation about configuring Android builds for more details, and you can also look at samples to see custom Proguard configuration in both standalone and Gradle-based Amper projects.\nParcelize support for Android\nIn projects using the standalone version of Amper, you can now turn on the Parcelize plugin for Android, using the new settings entry: \nsettings:\n  android:\n    parcelize: enabled\nThis lets you annotate Parcelable classes with @Parcelize to generate an implementation automatically:\nimport kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize\n\n@Parcelize\nclass User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable\nAs Parcelize is an Android-specific feature, it requires some additional configuration in multiplatform projects, which is described in the documentation.\nUpdated dependencies and defaults\nAmper now uses these new versions of dependencies and default values:\nKotlin 2.0.20\nKotlin language version 2.0\nAndroid Gradle Plugin 8.5.0\nAndroid compile SDK and target SDK 35\nThis release also uses kotlinx.serialization 1.7.3 by default and allows you to customize this version if needed:\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    serialization:\n      enabled: true\n      version: 1.7.3\nTo make it easier to set up serialization for various formats, the required dependencies are available from the built-in version catalog:\ndependencies:\n  - $kotlin.serialization.json\n  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf\nNew, unified cache folder\nThere is now a unified location for caching downloaded dependencies, whether Amper is invoked from the command line or used in an IDE. The ~/.amper folder that was used in previous versions can be safely deleted.\nThe new cache locations are as follows:\nOn Windows: ~/AppData/Local/Amper\nOn macOS: ~/Library/Caches/Amper\nOn Linux: ~/.cache/Amper (or if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined, $XDG_CACHE_HOME/.cache/Amper) \nUpdate your existing projects\nTo update a project using the standalone version of Amper, update your amper scripts by following the download instructions on the Usage page of the documentation.\nIf you’re using a Gradle-based Amper project, update your plugin version to 0.5.0:\nplugins {\n   id(\"org.jetbrains.amper.settings.plugin\").version(\"0.5.0\")\n}\nTry Amper\nTo get started with Amper, try the sample projects with standalone Amper or the samples with Gradle-based projects.\nFor full support of the latest Amper features, use Fleet 1.42 and IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTry Amper\n                                                    \nShare your feedback\nAmper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a YouTrack issue. Your input and your use cases help shape the future of Amper!",

We offer practical tutorials to enhance your skills, a curated list of November’s top tech events, both online and offline, and an exclusive feature by industry expert Mala Gupta.\nStay informed, and stay ahead!\nFeatured Content \nJava Developer Advocate with JetBrains, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Mala Gupta has authored multiple books with Manning, Packt, and O’Reilly Publications. She has more than two decades of experience in the software industry and is a regular speaker at industry conferences around the world. She is a vocal supporter of Java certification as a path to career advancement.\nIn this featured section, I want to highlight ‘JEP Explained‘ – a collection of heartfelt conversations with the Java architects and experts who helped bring Java 23 features to life. These conversations dive into JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), which are the key features planned for each JDK release. Our hope with this series is to help developers, teams, and anyone passionate about Java not just understand the new Java features, but to look beyond the syntax and dig into the bigger picture with behind-the-scenes stories and the experiences of experts. Here’s the link to the blog post and YouTube playlist.\nJava 23, released in September 2024, has twelve JEPs, and the ‘JEP Explained’ series covers eleven of them. Each conversation packs a bunch of information beyond the JEP itself. For instance, when we talked with Brian Goetz about JEP 455 (about the addition of primitive types to pattern matching), he also talked about balancing new features and complexity in software development, why compiler writers love pattern matching, how designing a feature is often a lesson in humility, and how the evolution of design is an organic process. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the complete interview for more insights from Brian, Aggelos Biboudis, and Tagir Valeev, as they all discuss the inclusion of primitive types in pattern matching.\n99% of developers I talked with believe that one of the reasons for deprecating an API in Java is the availability of better APIs. Ron Pressler stated this is never the case, when we talked with him about JEP 471 (deprecation of Memory-Access Methods in the sun.misc.Unsafe class). Ron also talked about ‘Tip and Tail: a smarter way to manage codebases for different JDKs’, whether folks are swimming naked when they use outdated code, the real secret to performance gains, and much more. Check out this conversation with Ron for more insights.\nWe had another interesting conversation with Viktor Klang and Tagir Valeev about Stream Gatherers in the Streams API. Apart from discussing JEP 473, Viktor touched on topics such as ‘The Power of Simplicity in Software Design’ and how bugs can’t hide in simplicity. He shared how the built-in gatherers can inspire folks, show what this feature can do, help them to get started using them, and then help them create custom gatherers. Viktor also shared why he loves to use JShell for prototyping. Tagir shared that the most complex code that he has ever written was for a Stream API library that he created, streamex. Check out the full interview for more stories.\nIt was a pleasure to talk about being able to use Markdown for writing documentation comments in JavaDoc with Jonathan Gibbons, owner of JEP 467, and Dmitry Chuyko. Jonathan talked about making Java more approachable by simplifying its documentation with Markdown. He discussed why Markdown is a game changer for JavaDoc and addressed which Markdown flavor to use. Dmitry talked about a challenge related to documentation at work – what happens when the documentation of a codebase is larger than its codebase? Check out the full interview here.\nIt was an honor and a privilege to interview all of these Java architects and experts for the JEP Explained interview series: Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, Ken Fogel, Rafael Winterhalter, José Paumard, Zoran Sevarac, Monica Beckwith, Paul Bakker, and Gavin Bierman.\nThough I would have loved to, it is not feasible to highlight all of the fantastic “aha!” moments and learning I experienced while talking with all the guests.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As a language that emerged over 14 years ago, Go has many use cases. From web development, APIs, and CLIs to Wasm, cloud technologies, and even AI-powered tools, its applications are broad. \nThe same goes for demo projects, which have countless variations and purposes!\nNow, wouldn’t it be great if there was a full-stack, API-oriented, and well-maintained demo project for Go? If you’ve ever experienced a demo project fail during a live presentation, then you’d certainly appreciate a more stable project! \nIn this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of creating such a project – a full-stack app using Go and React.\nCheck out the source code here to follow along.\nIntroducing Go Eats\nGo Eats is an open-source project similar to the food delivery apps you’ve probably seen and used before. The project simulates the operations involved when placing an order in a real-world food delivery app.\nTo build Go Eats, I used Go as the programming language, Postgres as the database, React for the frontend, and NATS for messaging. While Go is a good choice for these complex full-stack applications, finding demos can be challenging.\nI used GoLand for this project because it takes care of setting up the Go SDK, installing packages, and much more straight out of the box.\nLet’s take a closer look at the entry point of the source code: main.go. \nThis code initializes several services and handlers, establishes a database connection, loads environment variables, and sets up middleware, NATS, and the WebSocket.\nfunc main() {\n\t// load .env file\n\terr := godotenv.Load()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Error loading .env file\")\n\t}\n\n\tenv := os.Getenv(\"APP_ENV\")\n\tdb := database.New()\n\t// Create Tables\n\tif err := db.Migrate(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error migrating database: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Connect NATS\n\tnatServer, err := nats.NewNATS(\"nats://127.0.0.1:4222\")\n\n\t// WebSocket Clients\n\twsClients := make(map[string]*websocket.Conn)\n\n\ts := handler.NewServer(db, true)\n\n\t// Initialize Validator\n\tvalidate := validator.New()\n\n\t// Middlewares List\n\tmiddlewares := []gin.HandlerFunc{middleware.AuthMiddleware()}\n\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\n\n\tlog.Fatal(s.Run())\n\n}\nThe journey\nI started by working on backend tasks, such as creating APIs, before moving to the frontend. I chose Gin as the framework to build these APIs.\nWhile I could have gone with Gorilla, Echo, Fiber, or any other framework, I felt Gin would be a better choice for this project. It’s more mature and stable, it’s widely used, and it’s also somewhat of a personal preference. \nBefore selecting any framework, you should carefully consider the problem you are trying to solve or the specific business goal you are trying to achieve. Then weigh up the potential solutions and opt for the best one for your specific use case.\nThe backend\nWhile creating a demo app, it’s important to ensure that the application is flexible enough to accommodate future changes and refactoring.\nFor Go Eats, I implemented a service layer pattern, along with dependency injection. Additionally, I utilized handlers for request and response communication with the service layer, which manages business logic and interacts with the database.\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t// Reviews\n\treviewService := review.NewReviewService(db, env)\n\trevw.NewReviewProtectedHandler(s, \"/review\", reviewService, middlewares, validate)\n\n\t// Cart\n\tcartService := cart_order.NewCartService(db, env, natServer)\n\tcrt.NewCartHandler(s, \"/cart\", cartService, middlewares, validate)\nThe project structure shown above ensures that the project is modular and flexible. Remember that creating too many nested directories can add unnecessary complexity. Especially if you’re just starting your programming journey, it’s best to focus on simplicity rather than going through multiple layers. Keep in mind that your code will inevitably need to be refactored at some point.\nThe famous quote by Donald Knuth, “Premature optimization is the root of all evil,” feels particularly apt here.\n\nI did something similar for the database. I used the lightweight Bun SQL client. \nHowever, I made sure that if I need to replace the ORM in the future, my code will be able to adapt to the new changes based on the interface I have defined below.\ntype Database interface {\n\tInsert(ctx context.Context, model any) (sql.Result, error)\n\tDelete(ctx context.Context, tableName string, filter Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tSelect(ctx context.Context, model any, columnName string, parameter any) error\n\tSelectAll(ctx context.Context, tableName string, model any) error\n\tSelectWithRelation(ctx context.Context, model any, relations []string, Condition Filter) error\n\tSelectWithMultipleFilter(ctx context.Context, model any, Condition Filter) error\n\tRaw(ctx context.Context, model any, query string, args ...interface{}) error\n\tUpdate(ctx context.Context, tableName string, Set Filter, Condition Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tCount(ctx context.Context, tableName string, ColumnExpression string, columnName string, parameter any) (int64, error)\n\tMigrate() error\n\tHealthCheck() bool\n\tClose() error\n}\nThis interface provides a blueprint for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations and other common database interactions, ensuring that any struct implementing this interface can be used to perform these operations.\nGoLand keeps track of class implementation, making navigation much smoother. \nTo navigate to the implementation, press ⌘⌥B / Ctrl+Alt+B.\n\nMost of the operations involve CRUD activities. I was also eager to experiment with server-sent events (SSE) and WebSockets, which I’ve not explored much in the past. This project was a good use case for these technologies.\nLet’s begin with SSE, a technology that enables the server to push notifications, messages, and events to clients over an HTTP connection.\nThe code snippet below reads data from a JSON file and pushes the information so the client renders and displays the relevant data. \nfunc (s *AnnouncementHandler) flashNews(c *gin.Context) {\n\t_, cancel := context.WithTimeout(c.Request.Context(), 5*time.Second)\n\tdefer cancel()\n\n\tevents, err := s.service.FlashEvents()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tc.AbortWithStatusJSON(500, gin.H{\"error\": err.Error()})\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Set headers for SSE\n\tc.Header(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\")\n\tc.Header(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-cache\")\n\tc.Header(\"Connection\", \"keep-alive\")\n\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(6 * time.Second)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\teventIndex := 0\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\t// Send the current event\n\t\t\tevent := (*events)[eventIndex]\n\t\t\tc.SSEvent(\"message\", event.Message)\n\t\t\tc.Writer.Flush()\n\n\t\t\t// Move to the next event\n\t\t\teventIndex = (eventIndex + 1) % len(*events)\n\t\tcase <-c.Request.Context().Done():\n\t\t\tticker.Stop()\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nWebSocket and NATS\nSomething else I’ve not worked with before but have always wanted to try is using WebSockets with the NATS messaging system. I evaluated these technologies as potential solutions for the project and ultimately decided to use them in the demo app.\nHere’s how the messaging process in the Go Eats app functions: \nWhenever a new order is created, a message is published to NATS informing the subscriber about the newly placed order.\nWhen the delivery person updates the order – whether it’s on the way, has failed, or has been delivered – the customer will receive this information in real time, a process that will be reflected in the UI.\n\nThe code below defines the two topics:\norders.new.*: Sends a notification to the customer when a new order is placed.\norders.status.*: Sends a notification to the customer when the delivery status is updated.\n\n\n\n\nFor each received message, the application logs the message, extracts the user ID and message data, and attempts to send the data to the corresponding WebSocket client. If sending fails, the app logs the error, closes the WebSocket connection, and removes the client from the active client’s map.\nNote: Using map[string]*websocket.Conn to manage WebSocket connections with keys as client identifiers, such as userID, will not handle multiple connections from the same client, as the map keys must be unique. This is something I am planning to expand on in a future blog post. \nWhy NATS over Kafka?\nKafka is capable of handling large amounts of data, offering database-level durability and being enterprise-ready. \nHowever, I have never used it before, and I needed something that would work well for my specific use case. In that context, I came across NATS, which is written in Go and is ideal for lightweight, low-latency messaging, particularly in microservices and cloud-native architectures. \nA key point I would like to highlight is its simplicity. NATS was easy to use even when just starting to work with it.\nThe code below initializes a NATS connection and defines methods to publish and subscribe to messages. It connects to a NATS server, publishes messages to a topic, and forwards received messages to WebSocket clients based on user IDs.\ntype NATS struct {\n\tConn *nats.Conn\n}\n\nfunc NewNATS(url string) (*NATS, error) {\n\tnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.Name(\"food-delivery-nats\"))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error connecting to NATS:: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\treturn &NATS{Conn: nc}, err\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Pub(topic string, message []byte) error {\n\terr := n.Conn.Publish(topic, message)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Sub(topic string, clients map[string]*websocket.Conn) error {\n\n\t_, err := n.Conn.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n\t\tmessage := string(msg.Data)\n\t\tslog.Info(\"MESSAGE_REPLY_FROM_NATS\", \"RECEIVED_MESSAGE\", message)\n\t\tuserId, messageData := n.formatMessage(message)\n\t\tif conn, ok := clients[userId]; ok {\n\t\t\terr := conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(messageData))\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Error sending message to client:\", err)\n\t\t\t\tconn.Close()\n\t\t\t\tdelete(clients, userId)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\nThe frontend\nTo build the Go Eats UI, I used React. I don’t come from a frontend background, and it was quite challenging to learn and apply unfamiliar concepts. Along the way, I took Stephen Grider’s Modern React with Redux course.\nWhile I’m certainly no expert in React, the course helped a lot. That said, it was the use of GoLand, the JetBrains IDE for Go, which proved to be most valuable throughout this process.\nGoLand has excellent support for full-stack development with less distraction and context switching. The IDE provides exceptional coding support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, React, and many other languages.\nUsing GoLand, I can develop frontend and backend applications with the same IDE.\n\nFinally, here is the final output of how the UI gets rendered through React. \n\nI haven’t gone into much detail about the process of developing the Go Eats frontend. However, if you’re interested, you can check out the source code here. \nSummary\nAs I reflect on my journey developing this demo app, I realize there is much to learn and many improvements that could be made.\nHere are some key lessons from this experience:\nFocus on functionality first!\nIf you’re someone who is just starting to work with Go, don’t worry about making your app scalable or more modular by focusing on dependency injection right away. These concepts will eventually be required, and you will observe the patterns and restructure accordingly. Whatever you build, it won’t be perfect at first, and that’s okay! The journey is one of incremental and constant improvements. \n\n\n\n\nPrioritize testing!\nDon’t forget the importance of regular testing. Making sure you test your project frequently provides confidence that your features work as expected. While I have worked on tests for Go Eats, I still need to improve them further. Additionally, I have tried different testing libraries, such as Testcontainers, which help me test features in a real database instead of using mock ones.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase design matters!\nSpending time on the database schema is extremely valuable. Additionally, there are database migrations, which I haven’t used, but they are quite important, especially when you’re looking for rollbacks, versioning changes, and ensuring that changes are applied in the correct order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I’m happy with what I’ve built so far, it’s just the beginning for Go Eats. Stay tuned for more updates soon! \nI’d also love to hear your feedback. If you’ve had similar experiences or if you have thoughts on what you liked or disliked, or if you have suggestions for improvement, please share them in the comments.",

Today, we’re excited to share our latest innovation – a guided chat experience within GitHub Copilot that reshapes how developers interact with AI. This guided chat experience is available in Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 3 and above.\nThis guided way to chat was created with one clear goal in mind: to make interactions between developers and AI more natural, effective, and aligned with everyday workflows. It is our deep belief that conversational AI is the future of development, and we’re committed to leading that transformation.\nMaking Copilot Conversations Smarter and Simpler\nAs we’ve refined GitHub Copilot, one thing has become clear: while users appreciate the potential of AI-driven tools, there’s a learning curve. Developers have shared that crafting the right prompt can sometimes feel like a challenge—understanding how to phrase a question, knowing what context to include, and making the most of Copilot’s capabilities. In some cases, the experience left users feeling like they were getting too much or too little from their interactions.\nCustomer feedback highlights the challenge:\n“The chat experience is helpful, but I wish it felt more like an assistant—something that could help guide me and give me only what I need without extra noise.”\n“I love how Copilot just starts generating, but it sometimes feels like I have to sift through a lot to get to what I actually wanted.”\nThese insights inspired us to rethink how AI should work for developers. Rather than relying only on intent-based commands or predefined prompts, this chat allows for a more fluid, conversational experience—one that adapts to the user’s context and needs.\nHow does this work? \nOur guided chat experience takes Copilot beyond simple input-output exchanges, turning it into a collaborative assistant. When the context is clear, Copilot provides direct and relevant answers. When it isn’t, Copilot guides you by asking follow-up questions to ensure clarity and precision.\n\nThe implications are significant:\nMore Engagement: Developers spend less time figuring out how to phrase their prompts and more time focused on the task at hand.\nLess Complexity: Copilot’s ability to guide and clarify reduces the need for developers to navigate complex intent systems.\nIncreased Productivity: With less back-and-forth and more focused responses, developers can move faster through their workflows.\nIn our early trials, we’ve seen encouraging signs that Guided Chat makes a real difference. So we are excited for you all to try it out.\nAs we continue refining this guided way to chat, user feedback and engagement will be at the center of our improvements, ensuring that it delivers the intelligent and seamless experience developers need.\nThank you for your continuous feedback\nWe owe much of our progress to our users’ invaluable feedback. Your insights and suggestions have been instrumental in making Visual Studio better with each update. We appreciate your continuous support and look forward to bringing you more innovative features.\nThe post Introducing a new, more conversational way to chat with GitHub Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "A lesson about the software forensics process involved in developing the Bring Back Plus/Minus extension, which brings back the plus/minus symbols to the editor outlining feature in Visual Studio 2022.\nWhile I did have the advantage of being able to look at the Visual Studio source code, I could have figured this out just as well without it, and that’s the focus of this article.\nThe investigation of how to bring back the plus/minus symbols started with this important clue from a comment on the Developer Community feedback ticket for this issue:\nHowever, Visual Studio has a very rich extensibility model, and if users have strong feelings about the visuals in their IDE, I encourage people to try writing an extension to change the icon used here. The class that controls the expansion is this one: OutliningMarginHeaderControl\n\nA quick internet search for the class name led me to this reference article for OutliningMarginHeaderControl Class where the definition contains the following valuable information:\nNamespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor\nAssembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nPackage: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187\nNow that we know where to find this class, it’s time to examine the assembly. For that we will use the excellent ILSpy tool, which you can install from the Microsoft Store: ILSpy Fresh\nOnce you’ve installed ILSpy, launch it and load the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll. You can find this assembly in the Visual Studio installation folder, usually in the following path:\n<VSInstallDir>\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\Editor\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nAfter the assembly is loaded, search for the class OutliningMarginHeaderControl in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor namespace and you will find the following code for the static constructor:\n\nThis is where the default style key for the control is being set. The next step is to find the XAML Style for the control. For that we open the Resources node where we find themes/generic.baml, which includes the entire style for the OutliningMarginHeaderControl:\n\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n    <Style.Resources> \r\n      <ResourceDictionary> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandRight\">F1M2.146.146a.5.5,0,0,1,.708,0l4,4a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708-.708L5.793,4.5,2.146.854A.5.5,0,0,1,2.146.146Z</Geometry> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandDown\">F1M8.854,2.146a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708,0l-4-4a.5.5,0,0,1,.708-.708L4.5,5.793,8.146,2.146A.5.5,0,0,1,8.854,2.146Z</Geometry> \r\n      </ResourceDictionary> \r\n    </Style.Resources> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"FrameworkElement.Cursor\" Value=\"Hand\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Template\"> \r\n      <Setter.Value> \r\n        <ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\"> \r\n          <Grid> \r\n            <Viewbox Name=\"ExpandCollapseIcon\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"> \r\n              <Border Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.background}\"> \r\n                <Rectangle Name=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"9\"> \r\n                  <FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                    <ResourceDictionary> \r\n                      <SolidColorBrush x:Key=\"canvas\" Opacity=\"0\" /> \r\n                    </ResourceDictionary> \r\n                  </FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                  <Shape.Fill> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                      <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandRight}\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush> \r\n                  </Shape.Fill> \r\n                </Rectangle> \r\n              </Border> \r\n            </Viewbox> \r\n          </Grid> \r\n          <ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n            <Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\"> \r\n              <Setter TargetName=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Property=\"Shape.Fill\"> \r\n                <Setter.Value> \r\n                  <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                      <DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandDown}\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingGroup> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                  </DrawingBrush> \r\n                </Setter.Value> \r\n              </Setter> \r\n            </Trigger> \r\n          </ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n        </ControlTemplate> \r\n      </Setter.Value> \r\n    </Setter> \r\n</Style> \r\n\nThis is the style for the new chevron symbols. Here we find interesting things like the geometry for the expand/collapse symbols, the colors, and the trigger that changes the symbol when the control is expanded. The next step is to find the original Style for the plus/minus symbols. For that we can either use an older VS installation or we can take advantage of the reference information above, which states that this control is included in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187 NuGet package. Now we know that the symbols changed in 17.9, so we will look for a version before that. For example, the last one before that is 17.8.222.\nWe can download the package, change its extension from .nupkg to .zip, and extract the assembly from the lib\\net472 folder. Once we have the assembly, we can load it in ILSpy and look for the original style for the control just like we did before:\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" />\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Template\">\r\n\t\t<Setter.Value>\r\n\t\t\t<ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"WhitePadding\" Height=\"11\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" BorderThickness=\"0,1,0,1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"TheSquare\" Height=\"9\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.verticalrule.foreground}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.background}\" BorderThickness=\"1\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line X1=\"1\" Y1=\"3.5\" X2=\"6\" Y2=\"3.5\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line Name=\"Vertical\" X1=\"3.5\" Y1=\"1\" X2=\"3.5\" Y2=\"6\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"Vertical\" Property=\"Visibility\" Value=\"Hidden\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"TheSquare\" Value=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Property=\"Border.Background\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Trigger>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t</ControlTemplate>\r\n\t\t</Setter.Value>\r\n\t</Setter>\r\n</Style>\r\n\nSince the new style no longer uses dynamic resources for outlining.square, we must assume that these resources are no longer available in the new version of VS. This means that we needed to replace these resources with other colors. For the foreground outlining.chevron.foreground made sense. The background was a little bit harder because outlining.chevron.background didn’t do anything. With a little experimenting I had settled on outlining.collapsehintadornment.background for the first version of the extension. Both were not ideal or what they used to be – the chevron foreground is quite a bit darker and the background for the plus symbol is a lot lighter than before, but this combination worked in both light and dark themes, and any other existing color resources would look wrong in one theme or another.\nHow to build a VSIX extension to override the style\nTo override the style, I started by creating a new VSIX project with an async package:\n\nThen I added a new ResourceDictionary file Style.xaml to the project and copied the style from the old assembly, pasted it into the ResourceDictionary, and updated it with the new color resource value. Make sure that the Build Action for this Style.xaml is set to Page. I also gave this style a key x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\", so that I can easily look it up later:\n\r\n<ResourceDictionary\r\n\txmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n\txmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\r\n\txmlns:textUiWpf=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor;assembly=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf\">\r\n\t<Style x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\" TargetType=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl\">\r\n\t\t...\r\n\nThe last thing that needed to be done was to override the style in the InitializeAsync method of the package. The following code loads the resource dictionary, looks up the style by its key, and places it in the current application’s resources using the implicit style key typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl), so that Visual Studio will find this Style first:\n\r\nprotected override async Task InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress progress) \r\n{ \r\n\t// When initialized asynchronously, the current thread may be a background thread at this point. \r\n\t// Do any initialization that requires the UI thread after switching to the UI thread. \r\n\tawait this.JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync(cancellationToken); \r\n\tvar resourceDictionary = new ResourceDictionary(); \r\n\tresourceDictionary.Source = new Uri(\"pack://application:,,,/BringBackPlusMinus;component/Style.xaml\"); \r\n\tvar style = resourceDictionary[\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\"]; \r\n\tApplication.Current.Resources[typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl)] = style; \r\n}\r\n\nBuilding and running the project launched the experimental instance of Visual Studio and voila – the plus/minus symbols were back!\nNow all that was left to do was to update the vsixmanifest, build the extension in Release mode, and upload it to the Visual Studio Marketplace following this Walkthrough: Publish a Visual Studio extension.\nAdding support for color customization\nWhen I started using the preview builds of Visual Studio 2022 17.12, I noticed that the rendering of the plus/minus symbols was broken because the chevron symbol color definition had changed. I decided to introduce a dedicated color definition for the plus/minus symbols to avoid such problems going forward:\n\r\n[Export(typeof(EditorFormatDefinition))] \r\n[Name(OutliningExpanderIdentifier)] \r\n[UserVisible(true)] \r\ninternal sealed class OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition : EditorFormatDefinition \r\n{ \r\n\tpublic const string OutliningExpanderIdentifier = \"outlining.plusminus\"; \r\n\tpublic OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition() \r\n\t{ \r\n\t\tthis.ForegroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0x55, 0x55, 0x55); \r\n\t\tthis.BackgroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0xE2, 0xE2, 0xE2); \r\n\t\tthis.DisplayName = Strings.OutliningMarginPlusMinus; \r\n\t} \r\n}\r\n\nAs an added benefit the colors are now consistent with the original plus/minus symbols, and they can be customized in Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors:\n\nTo make sure that the colors look correct in the dark theme as well, I added a ThemeColors.xml file to the project with the following content:\n\r\n<Themes> \r\n\t<Theme Name=\"Dark\" GUID=\"{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}\"> \r\n\t\t<Category Name=\"BringBackPlusMinus\" GUID=\"{063E9575-C1A8-4729-BB15-AAA2EFB44FC0}\"> \r\n\t\t\t<Color Name=\"outlining.plusminus\"> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" /> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Foreground Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFE2E2E2\" /> \r\n\t\t\t</Color> \r\n\t\t</Category> \r\n\t</Theme> \r\n</Themes>\r\n\nIt needs to be converted to a .pkgdef file using the VsixColorCompiler first, which is then included in the extension’s .vsixmanifest.\nConclusion\nIn summary, with a little bit of detective work we were able to locate the style for the outlining symbols, build a VSIX extension, and override the style with the original style that brings back the original plus/minus outlining buttons.\nThe source code for the extension is available on GitHub.\nThe post The making of Bring Back Plus/Minus appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

href=\"https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/architecture\">Architecting your Compose UI - UDF 부분 참고 - link</a></p>\n\n<p>UDF는 단방향 데이터 플로우인데, 위에서 설명한 blocking, nonblocking 역시 단방향 플로우를 가진다.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A 함수를 실행</li>\n  <li>B 함수의 처리</li>\n  <li>다시 A 함수로 돌아와 이어가기</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>데이터 흐름상 단방향이다.</p>\n\n<p>Observer pattern + stream에서는?</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A 함수를 실행</li>\n  <li>B

흐름을 쉽게 이해하는 데 이를 아주 쉽게 설명한 설명이다.</p>\n\n<p>모든 흐름은 함수의 호출과 그 함수 안에서 새로운 함수의 호출 또는 구독으로 이루어진다. 이를 설명하는 가장 쉬운 방법이 UDF 인 것이다.</p>\n\n<p>그럼 아래의 코드에 대해서 UDF로 설명해 보자.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-kotlin

        "contentSnippet": "제미나이에게 개발에서 데이터 흐름이란?를 알려달라고 했다.\n개발에서 데이터 흐름은 어떤 시스템이나 소프트웨어에서 데이터가 생성되고, 변환되며, 저장되고, 전송되는 과정을 의미합니다. 마치 물이 강을 따라 흐르듯이, 데이터는 시스템 내에서 특정한 경로를 따라 이동하며 가치를 창출합니다.\n위키백과도 한번 확인해 보았다.\n위키 백과 데이터 흐름 - 링크\n데이터 흐름(Data flow, 데이터 플로)란 하나의 작업을 수행하기 위하여 실행되는 각각의 세부 작업들 사이에서 자료가 입력되고 출력되는 모습을 의미한다.\n결국 같은 말이다.\n우리가 매우 흔하게 사용하는 데이터 흐름을 가볍게 이해하는 표현으로 서문을 작성해 보았다.\n이 글에서 데이터 다양한 데이터 흐름을 이해하는 데 도움이 될만한 내용을 정리해 본 글인데, 실제 함수 위주이니 참고만 한다고 생각하길\n이 글에서는\n함수의 blocking vs nonblocking\nObserver pattern + stream\nUDF(unidirectional data flow)\n매우 주관적으로 작성한 글이다.\n데이터 흐름(Data flow)에 대한 새로운 형태를 만드는 짝퉁 설명이니 재미로 읽기를\n함수의 blocking vs nonblocking\n함수에는 blocking과 nonblocking으로 구분된다.\n\nfun main() {\n    println(\"main\")\n    someA()\n    println(\"end)\n}\n\nfun someA() {\n    println(\"run some a\")\n}\n\n\n이 함수의 결과는 다음과 같다.\n\nmain\nrun some a\nend\n\n\n이유는 간단하다. blocking이기 때문이다.\n그럼 아래의 코드는?\n\nfun main() {\n    println(\"main\")\n    someA()\n    println(\"end\")\n}\n\nfun someA() = CoroutinesScope().launch {\n    println(\"run coroutines)\n}\n\n\n이 함수의 결과는 다음과 같을 수 있다.\n\nmain\nend\nrun coroutines\n\n\n이는 nonblocking이니 가능한 결과이지만 end 전에 coroutines이 실행되어 순서대로 나올 순 있다.\n여기서의 흐름은 처음 예제는 명확히 순서를 보장한다는 점이고, 후자는 비동기가 필요하기에 순서의 보장이 필요 없는 경우를 말한다.\n데이터 흐름에서 가장 중요한 부분은 비동기라고 할 수 있다.\n\n그럼 아래의 코드는 blocking, nonblocking 중 어느 것일까?\n아래 링크에 포함되어 있는 코드를 그대로 가져왔다.\ncoroutineScope - link\n\nfun main() {\n    CoroutinesScope().launch {\n        println(\"main\")\n        showSomeData()\n        println(\"end\")\n    }\n}\n\nsuspend fun showSomeData() = coroutineScope {\n    val data = async(Dispatchers.IO) { // <- extension on current scope\n     ... load some UI data for the Main thread ...\n    }\n\n    withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {\n        doSomeWork()\n        val result = data.await()\n        display(result)\n    }\n}\n\n\nmain 함수는 blocking\nmain 함수의 CoroutinesScope().launch의 시작점은 nonblocking\nlaunch { } 안의 내용은 blocking\nshowSomeData()의 async 시작 부분은 nonblocking\nshowSomeData()의 async 내부는 blocking\nshowSomeData()의 withContext 부분은 blocking\n이 코드는 blocking과 nonblocking이 매우 많이 뒤섞여있다.\n이런 코드가 아주 흔한 일이다. 여기서 동기와 비동기 부분을 명확히 이해해야 데이터 흐름을 빠르게 파악할 수 있다.\n이 코드는 이 글의 핵심은 아니지만 동기와 비동기를 이해하는 데 있어 중요한 코드이며, coroutines은 일반적인 함수의 사용만큼이나 쉽다는 점이다.\n\nObserver pattern + stream\n다음 문장은 어떤 부분을 설명하는 걸까?\n\n물이 흐르고 있다. 이 흐르는 물에 새로운 물줄기를 추가했다.\n\n\n이 설명은 개발에서 HotFlow/HotObserve에 대한 설명일 수 있지만 내가 적었으니 맞다.\n여기서 중요한 부분은 무엇일까?\n바로 흐름(flow)이다. Observer pattern에서 데이터 흐름을 설명하는 쉬운 방법 중 하나이다.\n물이 흐른다는 표현을 적었으니 흐르는구나를 알 수 있고, 지속적인 흐름을 의미할 수 있다.\n반대로 흐르지 않는 경우도 있는데 어떻게 설명해 볼 수 있을까?\n\n나는 얼음이다. 땡 해주기 전에는 움직일 수 없다.\n\n\n\nCoroutines flow는?\nAsynchronous Flow - link\nA suspending function asynchronously returns a single value, but how can we return multiple asynchronously computed values? This is where Kotlin Flows come in.\n코루틴 flow는 단일 값을 한 번씩 호출하여 사용할 수 있는 suspend 대신 지속적인 흐름을 가지기 위한 개념을 포함한다. 바로 Observer + stream을 포함한다.\n\nHotFlow/ColdFlow?\n서문에 적은 설명은 오류를 가질 수 있지만 HotFlow/ColdFlow를 각각 설명하기 쉬운 주제라고 생각하여 필자가 주로 설명하는 방식이다.\nHotFlow는 두 가지가 존재하는데\nStateFlow\nSharedFlow\n사용법이 다를 뿐 둘 다 HotFlow이다.\nColdFlow는\nflow {}\nflowOf()\nflow의 시작점이다.\n\n추가로 - O 어떤 걸로 구성되어 있을까?\n이 글에서는 상세한 내용을 알아보기 위해서 적는 글은 아니니 가볍게 가볍게 어떤 구성으로 이루어져 있을까만 적어본다.\n얼음이거나 물이 흐르거나로 표현할 수 있었던 이유는 흐르는 물 사이에 새로운 물줄기를 만들거나 얼음을 깨어 새로운 데이터 흐름을 추가할 수 있다는 소리인데\n요즘 안드로이드에서는 잘 사용하지 않는 ReactiveX 문서에는 여전히\n\nReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from\nthe Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming\n\n\n이라고 표현하고 있다.\n이 데이터 흐름을 이해하기 위해서는 결국 Observer pattern과 Iterator pattern 만 알아도 충분히 이해할 수 있다는 이야기다.\n그럼 안드로이드 개발에서 상태의 기억을 가지는 3가지 나열해 보면 아래와 같다.\nRxJava - Subject 패턴들 4가지가 있으나 상황에 따라 다른 사용을 가짐\nStateFlow\nLiveData\n이들은 모두 데이터의 제공과 이를 소비하는 패턴으로 만들어져있다.\n이때 중요한 부분은 불변으로 데이터를 소비할 수 있도록 만들어주는 데 있다. 불변과 equals/hashCode의 중요성을 각각 확인할 수 있는 관련 글 2개를 링크로 추가한다.\nItem 1. 가변성을 제한하라 -

        "contentSnippet": "윈도우11 라이센스 종류 확인하는 방법을 알아보세요. OEM, Retail, Volume 라이센스의 차이와 확인 방법을 상세히 안내해 드립니다. 올바른 라이센스 확인으로 정품 인증 문제를 예방하세요!\n\n\n \n 여러분은 윈도우11을 사용하면서 자신의 윈도우 라이센스 종류가 무엇인지 궁금해 본 적 있으신가요?   새로운 PC를 구입했거나 중고로 PC를 구매할 경우, 설치된 윈도우가 정품인지 확인하는 것은 매우 중요합니다. 특히, 라이센스 종류에 따라 PC 변경 시 재설치 가능 여부나 사용 제한이 달라질 수 있기 때문에, 자신이 보유한 라이센스 유형을 정확히 파악하는 것이 필요합니다.\n \n 윈도우11 라이센스는 OEM, Retail, Volume 라이센스로 크게 나뉘며, 각 유형마다 특징이 다릅니다. 이 글에서는 윈도우11 라이센스 종류를 쉽게 확인하는 방법을 단계별로 안내하고, 각 라이센스의 차이점을 설명해 드리겠습니다. 이 정보를 통해 여러분의 PC 라이센스를 더욱 효율적으로 관리하고 활용할 수 있기를 바랍니다.  \n \n윈도우11 라이센스 종류 이해하기\n윈도우11의 라이센스는 사용 목적과 배포 방식에 따라 크게 OEM, Retail, Volume의 세 가지로 구분됩니다. 각 라이센스 유형은 설치, 재설치, PC 변경 시의 사용 제한 조건이 다릅니다. 아래에서 각각의 라이센스 유형을 자세히 설명드리겠습니다.\n  1. OEM 라이센스\nOEM(Original Equipment Manufacturer) 라이센스는 주로 PC 제조사에서 사전에 설치된 상태로 제공되는 윈도우 버전입니다. 여러분이 새로 구입한 노트북이나 데스크탑 컴퓨터에는 대부분 이 OEM 라이센스가 포함되어 있을 것입니다.\n특징 및 사용 제한\n\n특정 PC 하드웨어에 종속되며, 해당 PC에서만 사용 가능합니다.\n만약 메인보드와 같은 주요 하드웨어를 교체하면 라이센스가 무효화될 수 있습니다.\n재설치는 가능하지만, 동일한 PC 내에서만 가능합니다.\n장점\n\n초기 설정이 완료된 상태로 제공되므로, 별도의 설치 과정 없이 바로 사용할 수 있어 편리합니다.\n상대적으로 저렴한 가격으로 제공됩니다.\n단점\n\n다른 PC로 라이센스를 이전할 수 없으므로 중고 PC를 구매할 때 주의해야 합니다.\nPC를 교체하거나 하드웨어를 업그레이드할 경우 추가 라이센스 구매가 필요할 수 있습니다.\n \n  2. Retail(리테일) 라이센스\n리테일 라이센스는 일반 사용자들이 마이크로소프트 스토어나 공식 판매처에서 직접 구매할 수 있는 버전입니다. 가정용 사용자나 프리랜서에게 가장 적합한 라이센스로, 기존 PC에서 새로운 PC로 자유롭게 이전이 가능합니다.\n특징 및 사용 제한\n\n여러 번 재설치 가능하며, 다른 PC로 라이센스를 이전할 수 있습니다.\n정품 인증을 받은 후에도 다른 PC로 이동할 수 있지만, 동시에 두 대의 PC에서 사용할 수는 없습니다.\n장점\n\nPC 변경 시 자유롭게 라이센스 이전이 가능하므로, 새로운 PC를 구매하더라도 추가 비용이 들지 않습니다.\n고객 지원 및 업데이트가 보장되므로, 문제 발생 시 마이크로소프트의 지원을 받을 수 있습니다.\n단점\n\nOEM 라이센스에 비해 가격이 높습니다.\n온라인 구매 시 가짜 라이센스에 주의해야 합니다.\n \n  3. Volume(볼륨) 라이센스\n볼륨 라이센스는 주로 기업이나 교육 기관에서 대량으로 구매하는 라이센스 방식입니다. 대규모로 운영되는 조직에서 여러 대의 PC에 윈도우를 설치할 수 있도록 지원합니다.\n특징 및 사용 제한\n\n여러 대의 PC에 동일한 라이센스 키를 사용하여 대량 배포할 수 있습니다.\n특정 기간 동안 유효한 정품 인증 서버(KMS)를 사용하여 인증합니다.\n장점\n\n대량 구매 시 비용을 절감할 수 있어, IT 예산이 제한된 기업에 유리합니다.\n중앙 집중식 관리가 가능해, 조직 내 PC의 일괄 관리 및 유지보수가 편리합니다.\n단점\n\n개인 사용자에게는 구매 및 사용이 제한됩니다.\n기간 만료 시 정품 인증이 해제되므로, 정기적인 갱신이 필요합니다.\n \n윈도우11 라이센스 종류 확인 방법\n이제 자신의 윈도우11 라이센스 종류를 확인하는 방법을 소개하겠습니다. 특히, 중고 PC를 구매했거나 라이센스를 이전할 계획이 있을 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 팁입니다.\n \n윈도우11에서 라이센스 종류를 확인하는 가장 쉬운 방법 중 하나는 명령 프롬프트(CMD)를 사용하는 것입니다.\n \nStep 1: 윈도우 검색창에 cmd를 입력한 후, '명령 프롬프트'를 관리자 권한으로 실행합니다. ▼\n\n\n\nStep 2: 아래의 명령어를 입력한 후 Enter를 누릅니다. ▼\nslmgr /dli\n결과: 몇 초 후 팝업 창이 열리며, 설치된 라이센스의 종류(OEM, Retail, Volume)가 표시됩니다.\n\n\n \n마치며\n윈도우11 라이센스 종류를 정확히 파악하는 것은 PC 사용 시 매우 중요합니다. 특히, 새로 구매한 PC의 라이센스가 정품인지 확인하거나 기존 PC를 업그레이드할 때 유용하게 활용할 수 있습니다. 이번 기회에 여러분의 윈도우 라이센스 상태를 확인하여 불필요한 비용 낭비를 줄여보세요!  \n \n \nQ&A\nQ1. OEM 라이센스를 Retail 라이센스로 변경할 수 있나요?\n직접 변경할 수는 없지만, Retail 라이센스를 추가 구매하여 새롭게 설치할 수는 있습니다.\nQ2. 윈도우11 라이센스를 다른 PC로 이전할 수 있나요?\nRetail 라이센스는 가능하지만, OEM 라이센스는 특정 PC에 종속되므로 이전이 불가능합니다.\nQ3. 중고 PC 구매 시 정품 인증 상태를 확인하려면 어떻게 해야 하나요?\n명령 프롬프트에서 slmgr /dli 명령어를 사용하여 정품 여부와 라이센스 종류를 확인하세요.",

고민하는 경우도 있음</li>\n      <li>아마 일이 즐겁고, 보람차고 프로젝트를 잘 진행하고 있다면 이런 고민은 하지 않을 가능성이 존재</li>\n      <li>컨퍼런스에서 발표를 보거나, 외부 요소(취업 시장이 어렵다는 이야기), 친구들과의 비교 등을 통해 이런 고민을 하게 될 수도 있음</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>제 생각\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>이 직무를 왜 시작하게 되었는지가 중요하고, 나에 대한 인지(메타인지)</strong>가 있으면 더 깊은 고민을 할 수 있음\n        <ul>\n          <li>내가 이 직무를 왜 하고 싶었는지, 초심은 무엇이었는지 등</li>\n          <li>내가 처음 원했던 방향을 계속 고수해야 한다는 생각은 아니고, 내가 최초의 방향을 잘 생각하고 있는지 고민하며, 그 이후 자신의 경험을 얹어서 새로운 길로 가야 할지 정리하는 것도 괜찮음</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>살다 보면 초심을 잊고 살아가는 경우가 많고, 초심에 대한 내용을 블로그 등에 작성하고 지속적으로 보는 것도 좋다고 생각함</li>\n      <li><strong>좋은 커리어의 기준은 누가 정해주는 것이 아니라 스스로가 정의해야 함</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>다른 사람이 좋다는 A라는 기준이 나중에 시간이 흐르면 다르게 될 수도 있음. 과거의 시기와 요즘은 또 다르게 생각할 수도 있음</li>\n          <li>학생이나 신입은 경험이 없어서 기준이 적을 수 있고, 이럴 땐 다른 사람의 의견을 들어보기도 하는 것도 다 한 번쯤 경험함\n            <ul>\n              <li>그러나 나의 경험을 늘리면서 나만의 생각, 기준을 만들게 됨</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n          <li>일반적으로 많이 나오는 연봉, 워라밸, 동료 등도 중요할 수 있지만 나의 근본적인 욕구나 이 직무를 선택한 이유에 따라 다를 수 있음\n            <ul>\n              <li>인정 욕구가 큰 사람에겐 워라밸보단 내 인정이 더 중요할 수 있음. 인정받기 위해 회사에서 성과를 높이려고 하고, 열심히 일하는 것이 즐거울 수 있음</li>\n            </ul>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>제가 생각하는 좋은 커리어는 <strong>“직무 하나에 나를 한정하지 말고 여러 경험을 하는 것. 문제 해결에 집중하는 것. 꾸준하게 계속 무언가를 시도하는 것”</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>여러 경험을 하다 보면 하고 싶지 않은 일을 할 수도 있지만, 그런 일도 경험으로 생각하는 편</li>\n          <li>다른 사람들이 하지 않았던 여러 경험들이 합쳐지면 나만의 고유한 영역이 될 수 있다. 제너럴한 영역을 여러 개가 있고, 각 영역을 아주 잘하면 그게 또 새로운 스페셜이 될 수 있다고 생각함</li>\n          <li>직무 관점에서도 MLOps나 Analytics Engineer가 하나의 직무에서 시작된 것이 아닌 다른 직무에서 확장되면서 생기는 직무라고 볼 수 있는데, 이와 유사하다고 생각</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>저도 고민했던 시기가 있었음. 레트리카에서 데이터 분석가, 데이터 엔지니어 일을 조금씩 했었고 쏘카에선 데이터 분석가, 데이터 과학자, 머신러닝 엔지니어, 데이터 엔지니어, Engineering Manager 등을 경험했는데 너무 여러 가지를 경험해서 고민되기도 했지만 <strong>회사에서 요구하는 나의 역할을 최대한 잘 수행해 보자고 생각함</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>여러 경험을 했기에 직무의 협업 구조를 알 수 있고, 어떻게 프로젝트를 시작해야 할지, 사업부에선 어떤 관점으로 생각하는지 등을 모두 이해하게 됨</li>\n          <li>조직을 키우는 경험도 해보면서, 조직의 규모에 따라 어떤 방식으로 운영해야 할지에 대해 고민을 할 수 있게 되었음</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>때론 지금 하는 행동들에 너무 의지를 부여하지 않아도 괜찮았음. 시간이 지나서 그 의미를 찾는 경우도 있었음</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>의미를 너무 찾다가 시간이 지나갈 수도 있다는 이야기. 과거에 했던 것을 생각해보니 의미를 찾은 경우도 있기에 너무 의미를 찾는데 오래 걸린다면 잠시 실행해보는 것도 좋은 방법이라 생각(<strong>의미와 실행의 적절한 밸런스가 중요</strong>하다고 생각)</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li><strong>좋은 커리어의 기준은 시간의 흐름에 따라 다를 수 있다. 내가 어떤 결정을 할지 기준을 가지고 있는지가 더 중요할 수 있음</strong></li>\n      <li>저는 연차별로 성장의 정의가 다 달랐음. 1-2년 차의 성장은 나의 성장, 3-6년차의 성장은 팀과 조직의 성장, 그 이후의 성장은 잘 회복하며 지금 현상 유지하기가 성장이였음. 지금의 성장도 다른 방향으로 가는 중</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p><img

존재</li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>제 생각\n    <ul>\n      <li>이럴 때 현타가 오고 이직 준비를 할 수 있음</li>\n      <li>그러나 저는 데이터 관련 어떤 업무를 하더라도, 회사에서 필요한 업무라고 생각함. 다만 회사의 조직 규모의 차이가 있거나 데이터 문화의 차이가 존재할 뿐. 그 시기에 내가 다니고 있을 뿐이라 생각함</li>\n      <li>데이터 문화가 아직 잘 정착하지 못했다면 직접 데이터를 추출해서 제공해야 할 수 있고, 대시보드도 데이터 직무가 만들어야 할 수 있음\n        <ul>\n          <li>이런 상황은 왜 만들어지고, 개선하려면 어떻게 해야 할까?를

앞으로 어떻게 발전해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n대략 2-3년 차에 많이 생각하는 주제(그러나 그 이후에도 이 고민은 계속된다. 답은 없고, 환경이 변하기 때문. 연차가 쌓이면 새로운 환경에 가고 새로운 의사 결정을 하게 될 수 있음)\n입사하고 초반엔 새로운 일들이 많아서 해당 내용들을 습득하고, 주어진 일을 하나씩 하면서 정신없이 보냄\n        \n그러다가 1, 2년이 지나고 일이 익숙해질 때쯤 커리어에 대해 고민함\n이런 고민을 하게 된 배경은 다양하게 존재할 수 있는데, 업무가 지루하다고 생각하거나, 스스로가 생각하는 이 직무가 해야 하는 일이 정의되어 있지만 그걸 안하 고 있어서 고민하는 경우도 있음\n아마 일이 즐겁고, 보람차고 프로젝트를 잘 진행하고 있다면 이런 고민은 하지 않을 가능성이 존재\n컨퍼런스에서 발표를 보거나, 외부 요소(취업 시장이 어렵다는 이야기), 친구들과의 비교 등을 통해 이런 고민을 하게 될 수도 있음\n제 생각\n    \n이 직무를 왜 시작하게 되었는지가 중요하고, 나에 대한 인지(메타인지)가 있으면 더 깊은 고민을 할 수 있음\n        \n내가 이 직무를 왜 하고 싶었는지, 초심은 무엇이었는지 등\n내가 처음 원했던 방향을 계속 고수해야 한다는 생각은 아니고, 내가 최초의 방향을 잘 생각하고 있는지 고민하며, 그 이후 자신의 경험을 얹어서 새로운 길로 가야 할지 정리하는 것도 괜찮음\n살다 보면 초심을 잊고 살아가는 경우가 많고, 초심에 대한 내용을 블로그 등에 작성하고 지속적으로 보는 것도 좋다고 생각함\n좋은 커리어의 기준은 누가 정해주는 것이 아니라 스스로가 정의해야 함\n        \n다른 사람이 좋다는 A라는 기준이 나중에 시간이 흐르면 다르게 될 수도 있음. 과거의 시기와 요즘은 또 다르게 생각할 수도 있음\n학생이나 신입은 경험이 없어서 기준이 적을 수 있고, 이럴 땐 다른 사람의 의견을 들어보기도 하는 것도 다 한 번쯤 경험함\n            \n그러나 나의 경험을 늘리면서 나만의 생각, 기준을 만들게 됨\n일반적으로 많이 나오는 연봉, 워라밸, 동료 등도 중요할 수 있지만 나의 근본적인 욕구나 이 직무를 선택한 이유에 따라 다를 수 있음\n            \n인정 욕구가 큰 사람에겐 워라밸보단 내 인정이 더 중요할 수 있음. 인정받기 위해 회사에서 성과를 높이려고 하고, 열심히 일하는 것이 즐거울 수 있음\n제가 생각하는 좋은 커리어는 “직무 하나에 나를 한정하지 말고 여러 경험을 하는 것. 문제 해결에 집중하는 것. 꾸준하게 계속 무언가를 시도하는 것”\n        \n여러 경험을 하다 보면 하고 싶지 않은 일을 할 수도 있지만, 그런 일도 경험으로 생각하는 편\n다른 사람들이 하지 않았던 여러 경험들이 합쳐지면 나만의 고유한 영역이 될 수 있다. 제너럴한 영역을 여러 개가 있고, 각 영역을 아주 잘하면 그게 또 새로운 스페셜이 될 수 있다고 생각함\n직무 관점에서도 MLOps나 Analytics Engineer가 하나의 직무에서 시작된 것이 아닌 다른 직무에서 확장되면서 생기는 직무라고 볼 수 있는데, 이와 유사하다고 생각\n저도 고민했던 시기가 있었음. 레트리카에서 데이터 분석가, 데이터 엔지니어 일을 조금씩 했었고 쏘카에선 데이터 분석가, 데이터 과학자, 머신러닝 엔지니어, 데이터 엔지니어, Engineering Manager 등을 경험했는데 너무 여러 가지를 경험해서 고민되기도 했지만 회사에서 요구하는 나의 역할을 최대한 잘 수행해 보자고 생각함\n        \n여러 경험을 했기에 직무의 협업 구조를 알 수 있고, 어떻게 프로젝트를 시작해야 할지, 사업부에선 어떤 관점으로 생각하는지 등을 모두 이해하게 됨\n조직을 키우는 경험도 해보면서, 조직의 규모에 따라 어떤 방식으로 운영해야 할지에 대해 고민을 할 수 있게 되었음\n때론 지금 하는 행동들에 너무 의지를 부여하지 않아도 괜찮았음. 시간이 지나서 그 의미를 찾는 경우도 있었음\n        \n의미를 너무 찾다가 시간이 지나갈 수도 있다는 이야기. 과거에 했던 것을 생각해보니 의미를 찾은 경우도 있기에 너무 의미를 찾는데 오래 걸린다면 잠시 실행해보는 것도 좋은 방법이라 생각(의미와 실행의 적절한 밸런스가 중요하다고 생각)\n좋은 커리어의 기준은 시간의 흐름에 따라 다를 수 있다. 내가 어떤 결정을 할지 기준을 가지고 있는지가 더 중요할 수 있음\n저는 연차별로 성장의 정의가 다 달랐음. 1-2년 차의 성장은 나의 성장, 3-6년차의 성장은 팀과 조직의 성장, 그 이후의 성장은 잘 회복하며 지금 현상 유지하기가 성장이였음. 지금의 성장도 다른 방향으로 가는 중\n\n정리하면 좋은 커리어의 정의는 내가 하는 것이고, 타인이 정해주지 않음. 나에 대해 생각을 해보고 나의 기준을 만드는 것을 추천함. 또한 시간의 흐름에 따라 성장은 달라질 수 있고 과거의 경험들이 갑자기 깨달음을 주는 경우도 있으니 걱정하지 말고 지금 순간을 잘 지내는 것을 추천함\n\n\n2) 데이터 과학자, 데이터 분석가. 데이터 직무의 고민. 커리어를 어떻게 발전해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n데이터 과학자나 데이터 분석가는 직무의 구분이 명확하지 않아 많은 사람들이 혼란스러워함(저도 과거에 그랬고, 요즘 커리어를 준비하는 분들도 여전히 혼란스러워함)\n        \n다양한 데이터 분석 직군 글을 보면 직무의 이름으로 판단하지 말고 실제 하는 일을 기반으로 판단하라고 작성했음\n1번의 고민(좋은 커리어)와 연결되는 부분인데 데이터 직무는 데이터 분석가지만 하는 일이 회사마다 정말 다양함\n        \n어떤 회사에선 데이터 엔지니어링을 하면서 인프라도 구축해야 하고,\n어떤 회사에선 대시보드 제작 위주로 진행되고\n어떤 회사에선 데이터 추출 요청 위주의 업무가 진행되기도 함\n위 상황과 더불어 데이터 관련 컨퍼런스에서 보면 다른 사람들은 멋진 업무 위주로 하는 것 같아서 자신과 업무를 비교하게 되는 경우도 존재\n제 생각\n    \n이럴 때 현타가 오고 이직 준비를 할 수 있음\n그러나 저는 데이터 관련 어떤 업무를 하더라도, 회사에서 필요한 업무라고 생각함. 다만 회사의 조직 규모의 차이가 있거나 데이터 문화의 차이가 존재할 뿐. 그 시기에 내가 다니고 있을 뿐이라 생각함\n데이터 문화가 아직 잘 정착하지 못했다면 직접 데이터를 추출해서 제공해야 할 수 있고, 대시보드도 데이터 직무가 만들어야 할 수 있음\n        \n이런 상황은 왜 만들어지고, 개선하려면 어떻게 해야 할까?를 고민하는 것도 좋다고 생각\n그럼 조직의 규모가 점점 커지면서 그 안에서 필요한 역할들이 무엇인지 알 수 있게 됨\n이 부분은 국가의 발전, 역사 공부를 하면서 어떻게 해야 더 좋은 조직의 구조를 갖출 수 있을까를 생각했음\n이왕 업무를 진행할 때, 너무 부정적으로 생각하는 것보다 이 업무를 한국 또는 세상에서 제일 잘하려면 어떻게 해야 할지를 고민함\n        \n단순 데이터 추출도 정말 빠르게 잘하려면? => 데이터를 잘 정리해 두는 것도 필요하고, 마트를 만드는 것도 필요하고, 쿼리를 실수 없이 작성하는 것도 필요\n하나의 Task도 더 구체적으로 쪼개보면 필요한 역량이 여러 가지고, 그것을 더 잘하도록 시도할 수 있음\n게임에서 하기 싫은 노가다 퀘스트를 하는 느낌일 수 있지만, 이런 퀘스트가 있어야 다음 퀘스트를 수월하게 진행할 수 있다고 생각함\n다른 사람과 비교하는 순간 자존감이 떨어질 수 있음. 왜냐하면 비교 대상이 대부분 자신보다 더 좋은 상황인 사람과 비교하는 경우가 더 많기 때문\n        \n컨퍼런스에서 발표하는 내용은 부정적인 것보단 긍정적인 것, 인사이트가 있는 것을 주로 발표할 수 있음. 그리고 그 발표가 그 사람의 전부가 아니라 특정 단면을 공유한 것일 수 있음\n다른 사람의 길이 아닌, 그냥 나의 길을 가보자고 생각하는 것을 추천\n내 이야기를 영화로 치면 지금 기승전결에서 중간에 있다고 생각하고, 어려운 상황이 나오면 역시 영화에 위기 한번 와야지! 이런 생각을 하곤 함\nLLM이 발전하면서 1인 생산성이 늘어나고, 단순한 데이터 추출은 LLM으로 대체하려는 시도가 엄청 많이 존재함. 조만간 SQL 작성은 데이터 직무의 일이 아닐 수 있을 것 같음\n        \n대신 데이터 직무가 무엇을 해야 할까? 생각해 보면 사내의 컨설턴트 역할이 될 수도 있고, 데이터 문화를 만드는 역할, 의사 결정을 위주로 하는 역할 등 다양한 역할이 나올 수 있음\n그러나 미래에도 과거처럼 작은 규모에선 직접 쿼리를 작성하는 시기도 있을 수 있음. 그래서 너무 걱정하는 것보단, 지금 하는 일을 잘하게 되면 나중에 도움이 되지 않을까 싶음\n커리어는 점진적으로 발전할 수 있으므로, 너무 조급하게 생각하지 말고 지금 할 수 있는 일부터 점진적으로 하는 것을 추천\n저도 시간이 지나서 8년 차가 되었음. 그동안의 경험이 아직도 생생한데 시간이 참 빠름.\n        \n커리어 초반, 학생 시절엔 ‘내가 될까?’에 집중했고 가능성이 있는지에 대한 질문을 많이 했음\n그러다가 경력을 쌓으면서 ‘내가 뭐가 될까’에 집중했음. 뭐가에 집중하면서 어떻게 해야 할까를 고민했음\n그러다가 요즘은 ‘내가 뭐든 되네’라는 생각을 함. 시간이 지나면 무엇이든 된다. 특정 시기에 내가 노력하지 않아도 회사의 업무를 하면서 경험이 쌓이고 있음. 혹은 내 개인 삶의 경험을 풍성하게 만들 수도 있는 것\n            \n무엇이든 되니 너무 걱정하지 말고 지금 하고 싶은 것이 뭘까, 어떻게 시간을 보낼까를 고민하고 하나씩 해보는 것이 좋지 않을까 싶음\n저는 ‘커리어의 목표가 무엇인가요?’라는 질문을 받으면 딱히 없고 그냥 오늘같이 하루하루 잘 보내는 것이 목표라고 말함. 장기적인 비전은 있으면 좋지만, 너무 큰 목표같이 느껴질 수 있어서 현실적인 오늘을 잘 살려고 함\n직무 관점에서 너무 직무 하나에 매몰되지 말고, 내가 얼마나 회사에 기여할 수 있고 사람들에게 도움을 줄 수 있을지를 생각하며 이 기준이 확장될 수 있는 기준으로 일하고 있음\n정리하면 어떤 일을 하더라도 회사에서 제일 잘하고, 세계에서 제일 잘하려면 어떻게 해야할까를 생각하면서 나의 길을 가려고 함. 좋은 커리어의 정의는 내가 하는 것이므로 내가 어떻게 하고 싶은지에 기반해서 하나씩 실행함. 직무에 한정되는 사람이 되지 말고 직무를 넘어서는 사람이 되려고 함\n\n\n3) 좋은 선택, 의사 결정이란 무엇일까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n의사 결정이 중요하다는 것은 많이 듣는데 그걸 어떻게 잘하는가에 대해서는 배운 적이 적음. 그러다 보니 How를 고민하게 됨\n멘토링 때도 종종 받는 질문으로 가장 중요한 순간의 선택, 후회하는 선택 등의 질문을 받음\n        \n아마 좋은 의사 결정, 좋은 선택하는 방법을 물어보는 질문이었던 것 같음\n의사 결정이 뭔가 한 번에 잘 돼야 할 것 같고, 틀리면 안 될 것 같은 고정 관념이 있었음\n제 생각\n    \n일단 저는 과거의 선택에 크게 연연하지 않는 성격. 과거 성격을 만약 돌릴 수 있다면 생각을 계속할 것 같은데, 그게 아니니까 현실을 직시한다. 그래서 과거 이야기를 물어봐도 잘 떠오르진 않음\n이렇게 된 계기를 생각해 보면 20대 중반부터 뭘 해도 잘 되는 경험이 없었음. 실패, 불합격 등이 많았는데 그게 너무 많아지니까 오히려 현실을 너무 낙관하지 않고 적절한 상태로 바라보곤 했다. 그러다가 니체 책을 보고 니체의 사상에 영감을 받음\n우선 “좋은” 이란 부분에 대한 정의가 필요함. 좋다라는 것은 상황에 따라 다를 수 있고, 구체적으로 정의가 된다면 지표로 나올 수 있음. 다만 지표로 나오지 않는다고 하면 너무 “좋은”에 집중하지 않으려고 함\n어떤 결정을 할 때, 들뜨지 않고 객관적으로 생각함\n        \n만약 지표로 표시할 수 있다면 지표를 정의한다. 숫자로 특정 상황을 표시하고, 이게 더 좋아지면 간다 등\n이 숫자가 높아질 때, 낮아질 때 어떤 Action을 할지 생각한다. 이런 과정을 Mental Simulation이라 부름\n            \n멘탈 시뮬레이션은 특정 행동을 하는 것을 상상하고, 행동하기 전에 예상되는 결과를 시뮬레이션하는 능력\n멘탈 시뮬레이션을 한다면 특정 순간의 지표가 좋지 않아도, 오르기 위해 어떤 것을 해야 할지 생각했으므로 다시 또 실행하면 됨\n과거에 아쉬움이 있다면, 한 번 더 시도해서 아쉬움을 타파하면 그만이 아닐까 생각\n한 번에 잘 되었던 적이 없어서 이 생각을 기본적으로 가지고 있는 것 같음\n어떤 경험을 하고, 주기적으로 회고를 하면서 고민한다. 이 순간에 내가 왜 이 선택을 했지? 이때 뭐가 중요하다고 생각했지?\n        \n그 당시 기록이 있다면 그 기록을 보면서 다음엔 어떻게 해볼까를 고민한다\n의사 결정 자체에 집중하는 것보다, 의사 결정을 대하는 태도나 의사 결정을 하는 과정에 신경을 쓰게 됨\nPM을 위한 데이터 리터러시 강의에 의사 결정 파트가 있는데, 그때 의사 결정 TIP을 다음과 같이 공유했음\n        \n(1) 답을 내린다는 표현 대신 베팅한다는 표현하기 : 답을 내린다는 것은 너무 부담이 생김\n(2) 에너지 레벨 고려하기 : 결정을 내리는 과정은 에너지를 많이 소모한다. 에너지를 덜 소모하며 결정할 방법을 고민함(같이 진행하기 등)\n(3) 당연한 것은 없다 : 당연하다고 생각하지 말고 항상 다시 고민해 보기\n(4) 개인적인 의사 결정에선 과감히 도전하는 것도 방법 : 회사에서 결정하는 것은 보수적으로 갈 수 있지만, 개인 관점에선 개방적으로 해보는 것도 방법. 이런 시도가 나의 안전지대(Comfort Zone)를 넘어설 수 있게 됨\n(5) 결정했으면 그 결정이 좋은 결과를 내도록 노력하기 : 결정하고 아무것도 안 하는 것이 아닌 그게 되도록 하는 것이 중요함\n(6) 사람은 결정으로 인한 실패를 피하고 싶은 성향이 있다 : 결과에 대해 받아들이고, 어떻게 개선할지 생각해 보는 것이 더 중요한 것 같다\n(7) 큰 결정은 누구나 어렵다. 작은 결정부터 하나씩 : 작은 결정에서 점점 큰 결정으로 가자. 대표님들은 어떻게 결정하고 있는지 살펴보고 간접적으로 나라면? 생각해 보거나 대표님들이 어떤 결정을 어떤 흐름으로 했는지 물어보는 것도 방법\n의사 결정, 선택에 대한 원칙을 만들었다.\n        \n대표적인 원칙은 “만약 내일 내가 죽는데, 어떤 일을 하지 않아서 무덤 속에서 뛰쳐나올 것 같다면 지금 하자”\n            \n무덤 속에서 뛰쳐나올 것 같다고 하면 너무 답답해서 해야 할 것으로 생각한다. 그래서 “이거 무덤에서 뛰쳐나올 정도인가?”를 생각하는 편\n좋은 결정보단, 상황에서 적절한 결정만 존재한다고 생각함. 그리고 결정하고 그 후의 실행이 중요하다\n이런 결정 원칙을 여러 개 만들고 주기적으로 수정하면 된다\n또 다른 저의 원칙은 데이터 과학자 원칙에 작성되어 있음. 목차를 공유해 드리면\n            \n의도적으로 남다른 선택해보기\n주기적으로 일하는 목적 찾기\n제너럴리스트, 스페셜리스트 이분법으로 생각하지 않기\n업무도 메타인지하며 목적 중심으로 생각하기\n나의 세상 정의하기\n회사에서 필요한 일과 내 흥미를 일치시키기\n팀 현황을 파악해서 개선점 만들기\n더 나은 커뮤니케이션 능력 기르기\n비즈니스 모델과 데이터의 접점 분석하기\n지금 힘들다면 여유가 있는지 생각해보기\n정리하면 좋은 의사 결정에 집중하는 것이 아닌 현재 상황이 어떤지, 지표로 표시해보고, 앞으로 뭘 해야할지 멘탈 시뮬레이션을 한 후에 결정한다. 결정을 한 후엔, 결정이 잘 될 수 있도록 노력함\n        \n순간 순간엔 좋지 않다고 판단할 수 있지만, 시간이 지나면서 경험이 쌓이면 그런 경험들이 좋은 순간이 될 수 있음\n그래서 이 결정이 좋은가에 대해 생각하지 않게 된 것 같음. 그냥 내게 있는 정보를 가지고 최선의 수를 두고, 계속 고민할 뿐\n\n\n4) 번아웃이 오면 어떻게 해야 할까?\n생각하게 된 배경\n    \n요즘 너무 번아웃이 심하거나 힘든 경우 이런 고민을 하게 된다\n제 생각\n    \n살다 보면 또 번아웃이 올 수 있다. 물론 회사에서 번아웃이 안 오는 사람들도 있고, 적당히 잘 유지하는 사람들도 있다. 어떤 경우엔 번아웃이었는데 시간이 지나고 깨닫는 경우도 있음\n번아웃은 열심히 한 사람이 온다고 생각한다\n        \n일단 번아웃을 인정하기\n번아웃을 나쁘게 생각하지 말고 긍정적으로 승화하기\n잘 하고 있고, 잘 하다가 에너지가 부족해서 번아웃이 된 것. 에너지만 잘 채우면 된다\n번아웃 원인 분석하기\n        \n번아웃이 왜 오게 되었는가를 생각함\n회사의 일이 많아서 그럴 수도 있고, 개인 약속이 너무 많아서 그럴 수도 있고, 제대로 쉬지 못해서, 다른 사람들은 잘 하는데 내가 상대적으로 뒤처진다고 생각해서 등 다양한 이유가 있음\n여러 이유가 있을 수 있는데, 그 이유를 천천히 보면서 어떤 요인이 나를 이렇게 만들었는지 살펴본다. 과거의 경험과 비슷하면 그 요소가 내게 더 영향을 미칠 수 있다고 생각한다\n번아웃을 겪을 때 기록을 자주 해놓고, 번아웃에 대해 한판 정리를 했음\n        \n나만의 번아웃 패턴을 통해 어떻게 해야 해소할 수 있는지도 알 수 있게 되었음\n인스타그램에 번아웃에 빠졌을 때 번아웃을 극복하는 10가지 방법이란 글을 작성했음\n\n번아웃과 관련되는 것이 잘 쉬는 것\n    \n잘 쉬어야 번아웃도 안 온다고 생각함\n그래서 나만의 쉼 전략에 대해서도 고민했음. 잘 쉬는 법에 대한 고찰\n내가 언제 어떤 환경에 있어야 잘 쉰다고 생각하는지, 에너지가 채워지는지 등을 보고 정리함\n이런 것들이 정리되니까 내가 에너지가 없으면 바로 그 행동을 하면 됨\n청소하기 : 5 회복, 해외여행 가기 : 50 회복 등 이렇게 나만의 숫자를 채워봤다(숫자는 나중에 바뀔 수 있음)\n너무 힘든 경우엔 아무것도 안 해도 괜찮음. 그런 시기도 충분히 있을 수 있고, 잘 회복에 집중해야 함\n    \nIT 업계에 있으면서 성장 지향적으로 살아야 한다는 말을 많이 듣는다. 나도 그렇게 살아왔는데, 어느 순간 너무 성장 성장!보다 나만의 삶을 정의하고 그런 삶을 형성하면 된다고 생각했다\n이런 삶을 형성하는 과정에선 직무 관점에서 발전을 덜 할 수도 있음. 그러나 이게 문제는 아니라고 생각함\n힘들 땐 잘 회복하는 것도 중요함. 회복하는 시기엔 회복에 집중하는 것을 추천\n저 또한 6~7년 차 시절에, 회복에 집중했던 시기가 있음. 성장이란 것은 누적치라 생각해서 그냥 버티기만 해도 유지될 수 있어서 괜찮다고 생각함\n정리하면 번아웃의 원인을 분석해보고, 나의 번아웃 경험을 한판 정리한 후 앞으로 어떻게 번아웃에 빠질 수 있을지 도식을 그림. 또한 어떻게 쉬어야 할지에 대해서도 같이 생각함\n\n\n그 외에 자주 나오는 고민, 질문\n여러분들은 경력을 쌓으면서 어떤 고민을 하고 계신가요? 고민들도 궁금하네요\n또 자주 나오는 질문들은 다음과 같음. 다음에 시간이 될 때 아래 내용으로 글을 작성해보려고 함\n    \n혹 다른 질문이 있다면 댓글 남겨주시면 참고해서 글을 작성해 볼게요\n추가로 자주 받는 질문들\n    \n제가 잘하고 있는지 확인하려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n시간 관리는 어떻게 해야 할까요?\n새로운 트렌드는 어떻게 따라가야 할까요?\n기술을 추구하는게 맞을까요? 어떤 기술을 공부해야 할까요?\n이직은 언제 해야 할까요?\n전 물경력인 것 같아요\n정리\n위에 나온 것은 모두 제 생각이고 정답은 아니라고 생각함. 사람마다 다르게 생각할 수 있는 주제\n제 이야기의 핵심은 나에 대해 인지(메타인지)하기, 나의 목표(비전) 정해보기, 계속 시도하기, 나만의 원칙 만들기\n\n\n글 작성하는데 걸린 시간 : 75분\n    \n하고자 하는 이야기, 개요 정리 : 8분\n초안 글 작성 : 52분\n클로드/Cursor와 셀프 글 피드백 : 5분\n2차 글 작성 : 10분",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "영어에서 많이 사용하는 문장 중 “You are in good hands”라는 말이 있다. 말 그대로 믿을만한 손이 나를 잘 잡고 있으니 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 된다는 의미다. 다양한 상황에서 이 말을 하는데, 비즈니스 상황 외에 내가 가장 많이 이 말을 들었던 건 미국 영화나 드라마에서 주인공이 적진에 침투해서 인질을 구출하면서 안심시키는 장면이 아닐까 싶다. 나도 영어로 대화할 땐 이 말을 꽤 자주 사용하는데, 투자자로서 내가 우리 투자사 대표님들에게 주로 하는 말이다.\n스트롱이 첫 번째 기관 투자를 했다면, 이 스타트업의 대표에게 “우리가 한국에서 투자를 제일 잘하는 VC도 아니고, 우리한테 투자를 받으면 회사가 꼭 성공하는 것도 아니지만, 그래도 you are in good hands 입니다. 저희는 회사들이 힘들 때 뒤에서 같이 고민하고 같이 궂은일을 할 준비가 되어 있는 투자자예요.”라는 말을 자주 한다. 우리 투자사 중 80% 이상이 우리가 첫 번째 기관투자를 했으니, 대부분의 대표님들에게 이런 말을 한다고 봐도 된다.\n솔직히 한국어로 “우리랑 같이 하니까 앞으론 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 됩니다.”라고 말하는 거랑 영어로 “You are in good hands”라고 하는 거랑 느낌이나 어감이 많이 다르긴 하다. 영어로 하는 게 임팩트가 훨씬 더 크긴 한데, 어쨌든 이 말은 내가 투자자로서 창업가들에게 자주 하는 말이다.\n그런데 얼마 전에 이 반대의 상황을 경험했다. 우리가 여러 번 투자한 스타트업의 대표가 나한테 “You are in good hands.”라고 했는데, 이 말을 듣고 뭔가 기분이 묘하긴 했다. 기분이 묘했다는 게 나빴다는 건 전혀 아니고, 오히려 그 반대였다. 내가 항상 불안해하는 창업가분들에게 이 말을 하면, 이분들의 표정이 조금은 더 편해지고, 심적으로 안정감을 찾는 것 같았는데, 나도 그런 느낌이 들었다고나 할까? “아, 이 말을 들으니, 이런 기분이 드네. 좋구먼.” 뭐, 이런 생각을 했던 것 같다.\n그 회사의 자세한 상황에 대해서 여기서 말하진 않겠다. 그런데 모든 스타트업이 그렇듯이 항상 돈은 없고, 항상 사업은 불안하고, 항상 원하는 수치는 안 나오는, 그런 전형적인 초기 스타트업이 대부분 거치는 긴 어둠의 터널을 지나는 중이었다. 우리는 사업을 직접 하는 사람은 아니지만, 이런 힘든 시기를 겪고 있는 창업가들과 워낙 많이 교류하다 보니, 이들과의 대화 속에서 항상 우리의 걱정과 근심이 직간접적으로 반영된다. 그날도 이야기하면서 이런 나의 우려가 표출됐던 것 같은데, 이분이 나를 똑바로 보면서, “걱정하지 마세요. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 했다. 이 말을 듣고 정말로 얼마나 안심이 되던지, 아마도 그분은 잘 모를 것이다.\n그래서 어느 순간부터 나는 우리에게 자금을 제공해 주는 해외 LP 분들이 글로벌 경기, 한국의 경기, 북한, 스트롱의 포트폴리오, 스트롱의 어려운 상황들 등에 대해서 우려를 표시하면, “Don’t worry. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 하기 시작했다. 우리의 창업가분들이 우리에게 큰 안심을 제공하듯이, 내가 하는 이 말도 우리의 LP들에게 큰 안심을 줄 수 있길 바란다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우린 지난 12년 동안 많은 회사에 투자했지만, 이 많은 포트폴리오와 같이 일하는 스트롱의 투자팀은 매우 작다. 나를 포함한 우리 투자팀의 규모는 딱 6명인데, 우리가 많이 받는 질문 중 하나가 어떻게 이렇게 작은 팀이 그렇게 많은 포트폴리오를 관리하냐 이다(실은 우리 내부에서는 “관리”라는 말보단 “지원”이라는 말을 더 많이 사용한다).\n어쨌든 우린 아주 lean 하게 일한다. 작은 팀이 엄청 많은 회사를 만나고, 현실적으로 힘들지만, 나는 욕심 같아서는 한국의 초기 스타트업을 전부 다 한 번씩은 만나보고 싶다. 요새도 우린 모두 다양한 팀을 만나고 있는데, 작은 투자팀이 많은 창업가들을 만나야 해서, 주로 첫 번째 미팅은 모두 각개전투 하고 있다. 지난 3개월 동안 나도 많은 창업가와 팀을 만났는데 이 중 어떤 창업가들과의 만남은 기억에 남아서 여기서 몇 자 적어보고 싶다.\n이 창업가가 하는 사업은 좀 뻔한 사업이었다. 아마도 웬만한 VC들은 “또 이 사업이야?”라면서 어쩌면 만나지도 않고 패스할 만한 그런 사업이었는데, 심지어 수치도 별로였다. 솔직히 나도 그냥 자료만 보고 안 만날까 하다가, 그래도 팀은 젊고 똑똑한 것 같아서 한 시간 정도는 이야기해 봐야겠다는 생각으로 만났는데, 역시 사업이라고 하기엔 제품도 없고, 수치는 전혀 없고, 전략도 특별하진 않았던 것 같다.\n하지만, 이 창업가는 정말 모든 걸 다 갈아 넣으면서 나에게 적극적으로 어필했다. 최근에 이렇게 열심히 본인의 사업을 나에게 설명했던 창업가가 있었느냐는 생각이 들 정도로. 그래서 미팅의 시작은 그냥 밋밋했지만, 이분과 이야기를 하면서 점점 더 집중하게 됐고, 점점 더 빠져들게 됐다. 이미 여러 VC들에게 거절당한 경험이 있고, 이 사업 절대로 안 된다는 절망적인 이야기를 너무 많이 들었기 때문에, 이번이 마지막 피칭이라는 생각으로 땀을 뻘뻘 흘리면서 자료를 설명하고, 내가 중간에 이것저것 물어보면 혹시나 본인이 말실수할까 긴장하면서 말도 버벅거렸다. 중간마다 내가 이분을 테스트하기 위해서 조금 재수 없거나, 불편한 질문을 던졌는데, 최대한 화를 안 내면서 논리적으로 설명하려고 하는 노력과 흔적들 또한 여기저기서 볼 수 있었다.\n내가 제품 데모를 보여달라고 하니, 이미 만들어 놓은 10개 이상의 데모 계정 중 하나를 선택해서 열심히 불완전한 제품의 데모를 보여줬다. 이때, 오래전 내가 뮤직쉐이크 하면서 VC들에게 피칭했던 그 모습이 이 창업가에게서 보였다. 그리고 마치 내가 이분에게 빙의?가 된 것처럼 몇 초 동안 2008년~2012년으로 돌아갔었다.\n우린 누구나 음악을 만들 수 있는 소프트웨어와 남이 만든 음악을 소비할 수 있는 작은 플랫폼/커뮤니티를 제공했는데, 음악 관련 사업이다 보니, VC들에게 반드시 고품질의 음악을 들려줘야 했다. 그래서 나는 투자자를 만날 때는 항상 노트북과 최신형 BOSE 휴대용 스피커를 갖고 다녔고, 방금 언급했던 창업가처럼 여러 개의 계정을 미리 파놓고, 각 계정에 다양한 시나리오를 이미 심어놓은 후에 상황에 맞춰서 제품 데모를 했다. 그런데 정말 데모 귀신이라는 게 존재하는지, 중요한 VC와 결정적인 미팅에서 멋진 데모를 보여주고 싶을 땐 매번 노트북이 버벅거리고, 중요한 기능이 작동하지 않아서, 나도 당황하고, 말도 제대로 못 하고, 땀을 뻘뻘 흘린 적이 한두 번이 아니었다.\n최근 했던 몇 미팅에서 만난 창업가들을 보면서 이런 오래전의 내 모습이 떠올랐고, 그때의 절박했던 상황과 생각들이 주마등같이 스쳐 지나갔다. 당시에 나는 꼭 투자받고 싶었던 VC가 몇 군데 있었는데, 결국 이들 그 누구에게도 투자를 못 받았다. 당시 나는 창업가의 위치에서 속으로는 “제발 이 투자자는 나 같은 보석을 알아보고, 우리 사업의 가능성을 알아봐 줬으면 너무너무 좋겠다.”라는 절박한 마음으로 열심히, 최선을 다해서, 미친놈처럼 피칭했었는데, 그걸 바로 내 앞의 창업가가 나한테 하고 있었던 것이다.\n내 앞의 창업가에게 우리가 투자할지 안 할지 잘 모르겠지만, 이런 생각을 하면 언제나 마음을 열어두고, 가능성을 열어두고 싶다. 이분의 사업이 아무리 봐도 망할 것 같아도, 이 창업가의 한 시간이 헛되지 않게 최선을 다해서 듣고, 보고, 물어보고, 공부해야겠다는 다짐을 다시 했다. 이 창업가의 눈에서 보이는 절박감과 초롱초롱함은 내가 오래전에 VC들에게 피칭할 때 수없이 어필하고 강조했지만, 그들이 무시하고 놓친 중요한 것들이니까.",

(1) 기업과 같은 생산자가 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우, (2) 소비자가 상품을 사용함으로써 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우입니다.\n예를 들어, 기업이 공정을 개선해 고효율 냉장고를 생산했다면 생산 과정에서 탄소 발자국을 감축했다 = 즉, 탄소 손자국을 늘렸다 볼 수 있는 것이고요. 소비자가 냉장고 사용 과정에서 전력 소비를 절감하기 위해 노력했다면 또 한 번 탄소 손자국을 확보한 것입니다.\n이처럼 저탄소 제품을 생산하고 사용하는 과정에서 줄인 온실가스 배출량은 해당 제품을 제공한 기업의 성과로 인정되며, 친환경 이미지를 강화하는 데에 기여할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}\"극적으로 탄소배출량 줄인 이 남자가 소·양 대신 먹은 것“\n(한겨례 21 2024.8.17)\n1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서가 나온 이후, 개별적으로 실험하는 시민들이 등장했다. 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는 2019년 보고서를 바탕으로 1년간 1t의 탄소만을 배출하는 삶을 시도했다. 처음엔 2050년 목표치인 0.7t에 도전했지만, 현재의 인프라로는 불가능하다고 판단해 1t으로 목표치를 바꾸고 성공했다. 올터는 리드헤드로부터 실험에 관한 이야기를 직접 듣고 실험에 참여하기로 결심했다. “사실 연간 1t은 불가능하다고 생각했어요. 연구소에서 제시한 (2030년 목표인) 2.5t을 목표로 해보기로 했죠.”\n연간 2.5t이라는 배출량도 하루로 치면 약 6.8㎏이다. 붉은 육류 위주의 한 끼 식사에서 배출되는 탄소가 약 7.7㎏ 정도이니, 연 배출 2.5t을 달성하기 위해선 먹거리부터 이동, 소비 등 삶의 전반적인 방식을 바꿔야 했다. 어떻게 가능했을까. 그의 첫 번째 전략은 교통수단의 변화였다. “북미 지역에서 발생하는 탄소배출량의 가장 큰 부분이 자동차입니다. 저는 1년 동안 운전을 완전히 포기했어요.”\n캐나다의 1명당 평균 탄소배출량 구성을 보면 교통이 35%로 가장 많다. 14.2t 중에 5t이 교통에서 배출된다. 올터가 운전을 포기할 수 있었던 이유는 부동산 개발업을 그만두고 환경 관련 웹사이트에 글을 올리는 작가 일을 시작했기 때문이다.\n“저는 운이 좋은 편이었어요. 집에서 일할 수 있었고 아이들도 근처에 있었고요. 제가 사는 도시는 쇼핑도 대부분 도보나 자전거로 할 수 있었어요. 또 대학에 강의를 나갈 때도 자전거를 타고 다닐 수 있었습니다.” 1년 동안 한 번 미국 뉴욕에 다녀온 것 외에는 비행기도 타지 않았다. 식단도 바꿨다. “고기를 포기하는 것은 어렵지만 소나 양을 포기하고 탄소 배출이 훨씬 적은 돼지와 닭만 먹는 것은 그리 어렵지 않았어요. 문제가 되는 건 소나 양과 같은 반추동물이죠.”(중략)\n\n\n전 세계적으로 기후변화에 대응하기 위한 목표는 ‘온실가스 배출을 크게 줄이는 것’입니다. ‘기후변화에 관한 정부간 협의체(IPCC)’는 지구의 온도를 1.5도 이하로 유지하기 위해서는, 개인이 3.4톤 이하의 탄소만 배출해야 한다고 발표했는데요. 이는 전체 온실가스 배출량을 인구 수로 나눈 단순 결과값이었습니다.\n하지만 2019년에 발표된 일본과 핀란드의 '1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서'는 더욱 현실적인 접근을 제안합니다. 각 개인의 생활 방식을 기준으로 탄소 배출을 분석한 것인데요. 보고서에 따르면, 전체 탄소 배출량의 72%가 가정에서의 소비와 관련 있으니 개인이 연간 2.5톤의 탄소만 배출하도록 더 노력해야 한다고 합니다. 더 나아가 2040년에는 1.4톤, 2050년에는 0.7톤까지 줄여야 한다고 했고요.\n기사에 나온 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는, 실제로 이 보고서에서 제안하는 방향으로 1년간 1톤의 탄소만 배출하는 삶에 도전했습니다. 기사의 또다른 주인공 로이드 올터도 2.5톤 이내로 탄소배출량을 줄이기 위해 이전과 완전히 다른 라이프스타일을 택했고요.\n그렇다면 개인이 배출하는 탄소 양을 줄이기 위해, 우리는 실생활에서 어떤 방법들을 실천해볼 수 있을까요?\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

바꾸기: 자동차 운전을 줄이고, 걷기, 자전거 타기, 대중교통 이용하기 등의 습관을 만들어 보세요. 특히 출퇴근할 때 자전거와 대중교통을 사용하면, 자연스럽게 운동이 되기 때문에 건강에도 좋습니다.\n식단 조절: 사육 과정에서 많은 탄소를 배출하는 소와 양 같은 붉은 고기 대신, 돼지나 닭 같이 탄소 배출이 적은 고기를 선택해 보세요. 더 나아가 채식 위주의 식사를 시도하는 것도 좋은 방법입니다.\n소비 습관 바꾸기: 전자제품과 의류 등의 제품을 최대한 오래 사용하고, 새로운 제품을 자주 구매하지 않도록 해요. 하나의 제품을 오래 사용하는 습관을 길러보는 것은 탄소 배출을 줄이는 데 큰 도움이 되겠죠.\n도시 환경 활용: 가까운 곳은 도보로 다니거나 자전거를 활용하는 등, 도시의 친환경적인 구조를 최대한 활용해 봅시다. 네덜란드와 같이 걷기, 자전거 타기에 최적화된 도시에서는 일상생활 속에서 자연스럽게 탄소 손자국을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 이처럼 도시 내 교통수단과 도보, 자전거 사용을 통해 배출량을 줄이는 습관은 탄소 손자국을 늘리는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n\n이렇게 개인의 작은 생활 습관 변화로도 탄소 손자국을 확대할 수 있답니다. 동시에 정부와 기업 역시 탄소 배출을 줄이기 위해 힘을 모아야 합니다. 정부는 탄소 배출을 줄일 수 있도록 도시 설계를 하고, 기업은 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출이 적으면서 친환경 제품을 만들기 위해 노력해야겠죠.\n탄소 손자국을 늘리는 것은 단순히 환경 보호를 위한 수단을 너머, 장기적으로 지구에서 살아가는 우리 모두가 함께 기후 변화에 대응하는 중요한 역할을 하게 될 것입니다.\n\n\n탄소 중립: 최종적으로 탄소 배출량이 ‘0’이 되도록 하는 것을 목표로 하는 개념. 배출한 만큼의 탄소를 흡수하거나 상쇄하는 방법을 함께 수행해요. 나무 심기 같은 활동이 이에 해당됩니다.\n지속 가능한 생활(Sustainable Living): 현 세대가 사용하는 자원이 미래 세대의 자원까지 고갈시키지 않도록, 환경을 생각하며 생활하는 방식. 일회용품을 줄이고 재활용하는 것, 새 제품을 계속 구입하는 것보다 하나의 제품이나 서비스를 오래도록 이용하는 것이 지속 가능한 생활을 실천하는 방법이 될 수 있겠죠.\n\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0
