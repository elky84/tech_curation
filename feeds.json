        "content:encodedSnippet": "WHAT IT IS\nThe rise of agentic software development means code is being written, reviewed, and shipped faster than ever before across the entire industry. It also means that testing frameworks need to evolve for this rapidly changing landscape. Faster development demands faster testing that can catch bugs as they land in a codebase, without requiring regular updates and maintenance.\nJust-in‑Time Tests (JiTTests) are a fundamentally novel approach to testing where tests are automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) on the fly to catch bugs – even ones that traditional testing might not catch – just-in-time before the code lands into production.\nA Catching JiTTest focuses specifically on finding regressions introduced by a code change. This type of testing reimagines decades of software testing theory and practice. While traditional testing relies on static test suites, manual authoring, and ongoing maintenance, Catching JiTTests require no test maintenance and no test code review, meaning engineers can focus their expertise on real bugs, not false positives. Catching JiTTests use sophisticated techniques to maximize test signal value and minimize false positive drag, targeting test signals where they matter most: on serious failures.\nHOW TESTING TRADITIONALLY WORKS\nUnder the traditional paradigm, tests are manually built as new code lands in a codebase and continually executed, requiring regular updates and maintenance. The engineers building these tests face the challenge of needing to check the behavior, not only of the current code, but all possible future changes. Inherent uncertainty about future changes results in tests that don’t catch anything, or when they do, it’s a false positive. Agentic development dramatically increases the pace of code change, straining test development burden and scaling the cost of false positives and test maintenance to breaking point. \nHOW CATCHING JITTESTS WORK\nBroadly, JiTTests are bespoke tests, tailored to a specific code change, that give engineers simple, actionable feedback about unexpected behavior changes without the need to read or write test code. LLMs can generate JiTTests automatically the moment a pull request is submitted. And since the JiTTest itself is LLM-generated, it can often infer the plausible intention of a code change and simulate possible faults that may result from it.\nWith an understanding of intent, Catching JiTTests can significantly drive down instances of false positives.\nHere are the key steps of the Catching JiTTest process:\nNew code lands in the codebase.\nThe system infers the intention of the code change.\nIt creates mutants (code versions with faults deliberately inserted) to simulate what could go wrong.\nIt generates and runs tests to catch those faults.\nEnsembles of rule-based and LLM-based assessors focus the signal on true positive failures.\nEngineers receive clear, relevant reports about unexpected changes right when it matters most.\nWHY IT MATTERS\nCatching JiTTests are designed for the world of AI-powered agentic software development and accelerate testing by focusing on serious unexpected bugs. With them engineers no longer have to spend time writing, reviewing, and testing complex test code. Catching JiTTests, by design, kill many of the issues with traditional testing in one stroke:\nThey are generated on-the-fly for each code change and do not reside in the codebase, eliminating ongoing maintenance costs and shifting effort from humans to machines.\nThey are tailored to each change, making them more robust and less prone to breaking due to intended updates.\nThey automatically adapt as the code changes.\nThey only require human review when a bug is actually caught.\nThis all amounts to an important shift in testing infrastructure where the focus moves from generic code quality to whether a test actually finds faults in a specific change without raising a false positive. It helps improve testing overall while also allowing it to keep up with the pace of agentic coding.\nREAD THE PAPER\nJust-in-Time Catching Test Generation at Meta\nThe post The Death of Traditional Testing: Agentic Development Broke a 50-Year-Old Field, JiTTesting Can Revive It appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re sharing details of the role backend aggregation (BAG) plays in building Meta’s gigawatt-scale AI clusters like Prometheus.\nBAG allows us to seamlessly connect thousands of GPUs across multiple data centers and regions.\nOur BAG implementation is connecting two different network fabrics – Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF).\nOnce it’s complete our AI cluster, Prometheus, will deliver 1-gigawatt of capacity to enhance and enable new and existing AI experiences across Meta products. Prometheus’ infrastructure will span several data center buildings in a single larger region, interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs.\nA key piece of scaling and connecting this infrastructure is backend aggregation (BAG), which we use to seamlessly connect GPUs and data centers with robust, high-capacity networking. By leveraging modular hardware, advanced routing, and resilient topologies, BAG ensures both performance and reliability at unprecedented scale\nAs our AI clusters continue to grow, we expect BAG to play an important role in meeting future demands and driving innovation across Meta’s global network.\nWhat Is Backend Aggregation?\nBAG is a centralized Ethernet-based super spine network layer that primarily functions to interconnect multiple spine layer fabrics across various data centers and regions within large clusters. Within Prometheus, for example, the BAG layer serves as the aggregation point between regional networks and Meta’s backbone, enabling the creation of mega AI clusters. BAG is designed to support immense bandwidth needs, with inter-BAG capacities reaching the petabit range (e.g., 16-48 Pbps per region pair).\nWe use backend aggregation (BAG) to interconnect data center regions to share compute and other resources into large clusters.\nHow BAG Is Helping Us Build Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters \nTo address the challenge of interconnecting tens of thousands of GPUs, we’re deploying distributed BAG layers regionally.\nHow We Interconnect BAG Layers\nBAG layers are strategically distributed across regions to serve subsets of L2 fabrics, adhering to distance, buffer, and latency constraints. Inter-BAG connectivity utilizes either a planar (direct match) or spread connection topology, chosen based on site size and fiber availability.\nPlanar topology connects BAG switches one-to-one between regions following the plane, offering simplified management but concentrating potential failure domains.\nSpread connection topology distributes links across multiple BAG switches/planes, enhancing path diversity and resilience.\nAn example of an inter-BAG network topology.\nHow a BAG Layer Connects to L2 Fabrics\nSo far, we’ve discussed how the BAG layers are interconnected, now let’s see how a BAG layer connects downstream to L2 fabrics.\nWe’ve used two main fabric technologies, Disaggregated Schedule Fabric (DSF) and Non-Scheduled Fabric (NSF) to build L2 networks.\nBelow is an example of DSF L2 zones across five data center buildings connected to the BAG layer via a special backend edge pod in each building. \nA BAG inter-building connection for DSF fabric across five data centers.\nBelow is an example of NSF L2 connected to BAG planes. Each BAG plane connects to matching Spine Training Switches (STSWs) from all spine planes. Effective oversubscription is 4.98:1.  \n\nA BAG inter-building connection for NSF fabric.\nCareful management of oversubscription ratios assists in balancing scale and performance. Typical oversubscription from L2 to BAG is around 4.5:1, while BAG-to-BAG oversubscription varies based on regional requirements and link capacity.\nHardware and Routing \nMeta’s implementation of BAG uses a modular chassis equipped with Jericho3 (J3) ASIC line cards, each providing up to 432x800G ports for high-capacity, scalable, and resilient interconnect. The central hub BAG employs a larger chassis to accommodate numerous spokes and long-distance links with varied cable lengths for optimized buffer utilization.\nRouting within BAG uses eBGP with link bandwidth attributes, enabling Unequal Cost Multipath (UCMP) for efficient load balancing and robust failure handling. BAG-to-BAG connections are secured with MACsec, aligning with network security requirements.\nDesigning the Network for Resilience\nThe network design meticulously details port striping, IP addressing schemes, and comprehensive failure domain analysis to ensure high availability and minimize the impact of failures. Failure modes are analyzed at the BAG, data hall, and power distribution levels. We also employ various strategies to mitigate blackholing risks, including draining affected BAG planes and conditional route aggregation.\nConsiderations for Long Cable Distances\nAn important advantage of BAG’s distributed architecture is it keeps the distance from the L2 edge small, which is important for shallow buffer NSF switches. Longer, BAG-to-BAG, cable distances dictate that we use deep buffer switches for the BAG role. This provides a large headroom buffer to support lossless congestion control protocols like PFC.  \nBuilding Prometheus and Beyond\nAs a technology, BAG is playing an important role in Meta’s next generation of AI infrastructure. By centralizing the interconnection of regional networks, BAG helps enable the gigawatt-scale Prometheus cluster, ensuring seamless, high-capacity networking across tens of thousands of GPUs. This thoughtful design, leveraging modular hardware and resilient topologies, positions BAG to not only meet the demands of Prometheus but also to drive the future innovation and scalability of Meta’s global AI network for years to come.\nThe post Building Prometheus: How Backend Aggregation Enables Gigawatt-Scale AI Clusters appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Based on findings from the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Survey Report 2025, The State of Rust 2025 offers a detailed look at how the Rust ecosystem is evolving – how developers use Rust today, which tools they use, how much they rely on AI tools in their workflows, and where the language is gaining momentum.\nWith Rust continuing to attract a strong wave of new developers and expanding into new areas of application, the report provides a clear snapshot of a language that is maturing quickly while still inspiring curiosity, experimentation, and long-term professional adoption.\nIs Rust still popular in 2025?\nYes, Rust remains both popular and in demand in 2025. The survey shows that developers continue to adopt Rust across learning, hobby, and professional contexts, indicating sustained interest rather than short-term experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The survey provides statistically meaningful insights into Rust adoption, developer experience levels, and usage patterns across different types of projects.\n65% of respondents say they use Rust for side or hobby projects, while 52% report that they are currently learning the language. At the same time, 26% of developers already use Rust in professional projects. This mix highlights a healthy adoption pattern in which experimentation and learning coexist with real-world usage.\nNewcomers continue to fuel Rust’s popularity\nRust’s momentum is reinforced by a steady influx of new users. In 2025, 30% of respondents reported that they started using Rust less than a month ago. This is a significant increase compared to previous years and a clear sign that interest in Rust is not slowing down.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, the share of developers who have been using Rust for 3 years or more continues to grow, showing that Rust not only attracts newcomers but also retains long-term users.\n\n\n\n    \n“My teaching experience this year has been a lot of groups moving to Rust from existing C and C++ projects, particularly in the government and government-adjacent sector. They are generally having a pretty positive experience, and the language has evolved sufficiently that the learning curve doesn’t feel vertical anymore to these users.”\n\n            \nHerbert Wolverson\n                                                                Author of Hands-on Rust book and consultant at Ardan Labs\n                                    \nWhy does Rust remain popular? \nDevelopers continue to choose Rust for its performance, memory safety, and reliability. As tooling, documentation, and learning resources improve, Rust becomes easier to adopt without losing its core strengths.\nTogether, these factors explain why Rust remains popular. Developers are not just talking about Rust – they are learning it, experimenting with it, and increasingly using it in real projects.\nWho uses Rust today?\nTo understand the changing demographics in the Rust ecosystem, it helps to look beyond raw numbers and focus on who these developers are. The Rust community in 2025 combines a large number of newcomers with a strong base of experienced developers, making for a unique and balanced ecosystem.\nMost Rust users are experienced developers\nThe majority of Rust users already had programming experience before they started learning it. This means Rust adoption is largely driven by developers who have worked with other languages and systems and are making a conscious choice to explore Rust. These are not beginners picking a first language, but professionals and hobbyists looking for better tools.\n\n\n\n\nDevelopers come to Rust from many ecosystems\nMany developers who adopt Rust arrive from widely used languages such as Python, Java, TypeScript, C++, and JavaScript. This diversity helps explain why Rust appears in so many different contexts. Web developers, backend engineers, and systems programmers all bring their own expectations and use cases, pushing the ecosystem to grow in multiple directions at once.\n\n\n\n\nThis mix of experience and backgrounds helps Rust mature faster. Newcomers benefit from an ecosystem shaped by real-world demands, while experienced developers help validate Rust as a serious option for long-term projects.\n“All roads lead to Rust!\n\r\nFurthermore, Rust is increasingly a brownfield language: it shows up alongside the languages people already know, not instead of them.\n\r\nPython developers reach for Rust (via PyO3/maturin) to speed up hot paths without rewriting their entire codebase. Ruby and Elixir shops do the same via native extensions. Meanwhile, C and C++ teams use Rust to incrementally harden their systems: new modules in Rust, old ones migrated over time, the two coexisting at the FFI boundary for months or years.\n\r\n”\n\n            \nLuca Palmieri\n                                                                Author of 100 Exercises to Learn Rust and Principal Engineering Consultant at Mainmatter\n                                    \nWhy newcomers choose Rust\nWhile many Rust users are experienced programmers, a large share are still new to Rust itself. This steady flow of newcomers is one of the most important forces shaping the ecosystem.\nMany developers begin exploring Rust with clear motivations: They want performance without sacrificing safety, or stronger guarantees than they’ve experienced in other languages. Rust’s focus on memory safety, correctness, and predictability aligns well with these goals.\nTo help developers navigate Rust’s learning curve, JetBrains provides several educational resources designed to support different learning styles and experience levels.\nHow to Learn Rust: Vitaly Bragilevsky’s guide lays out a practical approach to learning Rust, explaining the language’s core concepts, common beginner challenges, and how tools like RustRover can support the learning process. It offers clear strategies, recommended resources, and a realistic path for newcomers to build confidence with Rust.\nLearn Rust plugin: This guided learning plugin teaches Rust fundamentals through interactive lessons, editor hints, and instant feedback. It works in both RustRover and CLion, so developers can learn inside the IDE while writing real code.\n100 Exercises to Learn Rust: Based on 100 Exercises to Learn Rust by Mainmatter’s Luca Palmieri, this course offers a hands-on, test-driven path through Rust, starting with your first println! and progressing to advanced concepts like ownership, lifetimes, pattern matching, and generics.\nThese resources make it easier for you to move from curiosity to confidence. They help explain not just how Rust works, but why it works the way it does, which is key to mastering the language.\nThe Rust Ecosystem Today: Tools, Workflows, and Maturity\nA language’s success with newcomers depends not only on syntax or features, but on how well developers can work with it day to day. These workflows reduce friction, making Rust easier to pick up and Rust projects easier to maintain over time. In 2025, Rust’s ecosystem shows clear signs of maturity.\nTooling plays a central role in this progress. Cargo provides a consistent foundation for building, testing, and managing dependencies, while formatting and linting tools help teams maintain quality and consistency. These workflows reduce friction and make Rust projects easier to maintain over time.\nTry RustRover\n                                    \nWhat developers build with Rust in 2025\nRust’s use cases offer a clear view of where the ecosystem stands today. Let’s look at what developers are actually building with it.\n\n\n\n\nSystems programming and command-line tools continue to sit at the heart of Rust’s identity. These domains reflect the problems Rust was originally designed to solve, and they still attract developers who need performance, control, and safety.\nAt the same time, Rust’s role has broadened significantly. Web and backend development are now common use cases, showing that Rust is increasingly trusted for building services and APIs. This shift matters because backend systems are often long-lived and business-critical, so choosing Rust here signals confidence in its stability and ecosystem support.\nBeyond its core areas, Rust is used in networking, embedded systems, security, scientific computing, and early AI-related tooling. While some of these domains are still smaller, their presence shows that developers are willing to apply Rust to a wide range of challenges. The ecosystem no longer fits a narrow definition, and that flexibility supports long-term growth.\nRust rarely lives alone in real projects\nRust is most often used alongside other programming languages rather than in isolation. JavaScript and TypeScript lead this list, followed by Python, SQL, and shell scripting languages. This reflects how Rust is commonly integrated into existing stacks, powering performance-critical components while working alongside higher-level languages.\n\n\n\n\nThe presence of languages like C, C++, Java, and Go further highlights Rust’s role in mixed environments, especially in systems, backend, and infrastructure projects. At the same time, more than one-third of respondents report using Rust on its own, showing that the language is also mature enough to support complete projects end to end.\n“Rust is often described as a true all-purpose language that successfully covers a wide range of tasks. The data confirms this, as the top entries among complementary languages ​​are JavaScript/TypeScript and Python. JavaScript/TypeScript holds an exclusive position in the world’s largest runtime, the browser, and this is difficult to challenge. Python, on the other hand, is indispensable in many sectors due to its accessibility and incredibly rich ecosystem. And well, I think SQL falls into this category as well. However, when you consider all the other languages, there’s no reason not to switch to Rust, except perhaps to keep legacy projects alive. I’m curious how this will change in the future. My prediction is that the bars at the bottom of this chart will become much smaller over the years.”\n\n            \nStefan Baumgartner\n                                                                Author of TypeScript Cookbook (O’Reilly) – oida.dev\n                                    \nRust targets production platforms first\nRust projects overwhelmingly target production environments. Linux is by far the most common platform, used by three-quarters of respondents, reflecting Rust’s strong presence in server, cloud, and infrastructure workloads. Windows and macOS also see substantial usage, confirming Rust’s role in cross-platform development. This focus on production and infrastructure aligns with broader industry adoption trends discussed in the LWN analysis of Rust’s role in modern systems software.\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond traditional operating systems, Rust continues to expand into specialized environments. WebAssembly and embedded targets are used by a meaningful share of developers, while mobile platforms appear less frequently. These results show that Rust is primarily chosen for reliability and performance in production systems, with growing interest in newer deployment models.\nAI adoption in the Rust developer workflow\nArtificial intelligence has become a visible part of everyday development work, and Rust developers are no exception. The 2025 survey shows a community that is actively experimenting with AI tools while remaining thoughtful about how these technologies fit into long-term workflows.\nHow Rust developers feel about AI\nRust developers approach AI with a mix of optimism and caution. One-third of respondents describe themselves as hopeful about AI’s increasing role in society, while others express uncertainty or anxiety. This balance reflects a community that values progress but also cares deeply about correctness, safety, and long-term impact.\n\n\n\n\nRather than reacting emotionally, many Rust developers appear to be evaluating AI through a practical lens. They are interested in productivity gains, yet remain aware of the limitations and risks. This mindset aligns closely with Rust’s broader culture of deliberate design and explicit trade-offs.\nAI tools are already part of everyday development\nAI tools became a familiar part of Rust development in 2025. According to the survey, 89% of respondents have tried at least one AI tool, and 78% are actively using AI-powered coding assistants. ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot lead in regular usage, while dedicated AI editors and JetBrains AI Assistant are also widely explored.\n\n\n\n\nUsage patterns show diversity rather than dominance by a single tool. Developers combine general-purpose AI assistants with IDE-integrated solutions, choosing what fits their workflow rather than committing to one approach. This flexibility suggests that AI is becoming another tool in the toolbox, not a replacement for developer judgment.\nTry AI for Free\n                                    \nRegular usage and interest in AI coding agents\nAI tools are clearly embedded in day-to-day work. About one-third of Rust developers regularly use ChatGPT, with GitHub Copilot close behind. IDE-integrated assistants are also gaining traction, reflecting a preference for AI support that fits naturally into existing development environments.\nHere are the AI coding assistants, agents, and code editors most commonly used for Rust development in 2025:\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, interest in AI coding agents is strong but measured. Around one-quarter of respondents say they are very likely to try coding agents in the next year, while others remain unsure or cautious. This split highlights a familiar Rust pattern: curiosity paired with a desire for control, transparency, and reliability.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, the data suggests that Rust developers are not resisting AI, but rather integrating it carefully. They adopt tools that provide real value today, while remaining selective about more autonomous systems. This thoughtful adoption mirrors how the Rust ecosystem itself has evolved – steadily, intentionally, and with a focus on long-term quality.\n“Newer models are growing more capable of working in large, complex codebases. Rust’s built-in documentation, expressive type system, and readable compiler errors provide agents the context they need to work effectively. Whether using them for code review, complex refactors, expanding test coverage, or exploring new features, I am excited to see how experimenting with these new tools can help us all ship more robust and resilient software.”\n\n            \nBen Brandt \n                                                                Software Engineer at Zed\n                                    \nWhat 2025 tells us about Rust’s future\nData from the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 points to a strong and stable future for Rust. A growing community of newcomers ensures continued interest, while experienced developers bring production-grade use cases that deepen trust in the language. Expanding adoption across backend services, infrastructure, embedded systems, and emerging AI tooling suggests that Rust’s role will continue to broaden.\nImprovements in tooling and workflows further support long-term adoption. As Rust becomes easier to learn and more comfortable to use at scale, it is well-positioned to remain relevant as industry needs evolve. Rust’s trajectory reflects steady growth built on reliability and thoughtful design, rather than short-term trends.\nA huge thank you to the Rust experts who contributed their expertise, helping us turn these numbers into a much more meaningful story!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "AI models and coding assistants have become essential tools for developers. Today, developers rely on large language models (LLMs) to accelerate coding, improve code quality, and reduce repetitive work across the entire development lifecycle. From intelligent code completion to refactoring, debugging, and documentation, AI-powered tools are now embedded directly into daily workflows.\nDrawing on insights from the latest JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, this guide compares the top large language models (LLMs) used for programming. It focuses on how leading LLMs balance accuracy, speed, security, cost, and IDE integration, helping developers and teams choose the right model for their specific needs. \nThroughout the article, we also highlight how tools like JetBrains AI Assistant bring these models directly into professional development environments, backed by real-world usage data from the report.\nPlease note that the models listed in the article reflect those available during the research period, and may not reflect the most recent versions.\nTable of contents\nWhat are AI models for coding?\nHow developers choose between AI models\nTop AI models in 2025\nEvaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\nOpen-source vs. proprietary models\nEnterprise readiness and security\nHow to select the right AI coding model for you\nFAQ\nConclusion\nWhat are AI models for coding?\nAI models for coding are large language models (LLMs) trained on vast collections of source code, technical documentation, and natural language text. Their purpose is to understand programming intent and generate relevant, context-aware responses that assist developers during software creation. Unlike traditional static tools, these models can reason about code structure, explain logic, and adapt to different programming languages and frameworks.\nThe best LLMs for programming support a wide range of everyday development tasks, most typically being used for code completion, refactoring, debugging, documentation writing, and test creation. By delegating such repetitive or boilerplate-related tasks to an LLM, developers can turn their attention to more complex problem-solving and system design tasks.\nMost developers interact with AI coding tools through IDE integrations, browser tools, or APIs. This is where IDE-based assistants, such as JetBrains AI Assistant, are particularly valuable, as they operate directly within the development context, using project structure, files, and language semantics to improve accuracy and relevance.\nThe use of AI coding tools is influenced by several critical factors, including accuracy, latency, cost efficiency, and data privacy. According to the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, AI adoption was increasingly widespread, with up to 85% of developers regularly using AI tools for coding and development in 2025.\nAs AI capabilities expand, developers face an important challenge: selecting those AI models that best fit their workflow. The next section discusses how developers can evaluate the various options and make the best decision for their needs.\nHow developers choose between AI models\nDevelopers’ adoption of AI coding tools in 2025 was driven by how well an AI model integrated into real-world workflows and delivered consistent output. This often goes beyond technical specs alone and involves various practical and trust-based factors. \nThe top concern identified in the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 was code quality. IDE integration was another major priority. AI tools for developers that work seamlessly inside familiar environments, such as JetBrains IDEs, are far more likely to be adopted than standalone interfaces. Pricing and licensing also mattered for developers, especially for individual developers and small teams who need predictable or affordable access.\nFor professional teams, data privacy and security increasingly shape decision-making around AI model selection. The ability to control how prompts and code are processed, whether models can be deployed locally, and how data is retained or logged are all critical considerations. Customization options, including fine-tuning and contextual prompts, are also becoming more relevant as teams seek domain-specific optimization.\nOverall, insights from the report indicated a clear divide. Individual developer AI preferences prioritized usability, responsiveness, and cost efficiency. But for organizations, the principal focus areas were compliance, governance, and long-term scalability.\nKey selection factors for AI coding assistants\nThis table summarizes the core criteria developers use for quick comparison.\n\nCriterionWhy it mattersHow to assess\nCode qualityDetermines whether generated code is correct, maintainable, and consistent with best practicesEvaluate accuracy and reasoning in real coding scenarios\nIDE integrationAffects workflow continuity and adoption rateCheck for native support in JetBrains IDEs or other editors\nPrice and licensingInfluences accessibility for individuals and teamsCompare pricing tiers, free limits, and scalability costs\nData privacy and securityEnsures that code and prompts are handled safelyVerify local execution, encryption, and data policy\nLocal or self-hosted optionsImportant for teams with compliance or IP control needsAssess support for private model deployment\nFine-tuning and customizationEnables domain-specific improvements and internal optimisationCheck whether the model supports custom training or contextual prompts\n\n\n\n\n\nWith these criteria in mind, the next section explores the top AI models developers used in 2025 and how they compare in practice.\nTop AI models used in 2025\nThe JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 showed that developers did not rely on a single LLM. Instead, they used a small set of the best AI models for coding, depending on accuracy needs, workflow integration, cost constraints, and data-handling requirements.\nBased on developer survey data, the report identified the following AI models in 2025 as the most commonly used and trusted for coding tasks. It forms the basis of an AI coding assistants comparison guide that is grounded in real-world adoption rather than theoretical benchmarks:\nGPT models (OpenAI): Models like GPT-5 and GPT-5.1 were widely used and recognized as some of the best LLMs for programming in day-to-day development, particularly for code generation, refactoring, and explanation tasks. These models were incorporated in daily workflows due to their consistent output quality and large context windows. Their trade-off is cost, especially for teams with heavy usage.\nClaude models (Anthropic): Claude 3.7 Sonnet was commonly chosen by developers working with large files, monorepos, or documentation-heavy projects. It was frequently cited among top AI code assistants for its ability to reason over long inputs and maintain structure in explanations and generated code. However, compared to GPT-based tools, it offered fewer native integrations.\nGemini (Google): Gemini 2.5 Pro appeared most often in workflows tied to Google’s ecosystem. Developers reported using it for tasks that combine coding with documentation, search, or collaborative environments. While it performed well in speed and accessibility, it was less flexible for teams that require deep customization or private deployments when evaluating AI models in 2025.\nDeepSeek: DeepSeek R1 gained attention among developers seeking lower-cost AI coding assistance or local deployment options. It was increasingly included in AI coding assistant comparisons for teams experimenting with AI at scale while maintaining tighter control over data and infrastructure.\nOpen-source models: These models, such as Qwen and StarCoder, represented another category of best LLMs for programming for a smaller but growing segment of developers. They are most popular among teams with strong DevOps capabilities or strict data-governance requirements. While they offer maximum control, they also require significant operational effort.\nOverall, differences in reasoning accuracy, speed, context length, and IDE integration significantly influenced developer preferences when selecting among the best AI models for coding. For instance, some developers prioritized performance and reasoning depth with GPT-4o or Claude 3.7. Others chose more cost-efficient or private alternatives, such as DeepSeek and open-source models, depending on workflow and organizational constraints.\nCapabilities of leading AI models for coding\n\nModelDeployment modelConfig / InterfaceBest forStrengthTrade-off\nGPT-5 / GPT-5.1Cloud / APIText + code inputBroad coding and reasoning tasksHigh accuracy and large contextHigher cost per token\nClaude 3.7 SonnetCloud / APINatural language focusStructured code and documentationContextual reasoning, long input handlingLimited tool integrations\nGemini 2.5 ProCloudMultimodal, Google ecosystemWeb-based workflowsFast response, cloud collaborationLimited fine-tuning\nDeepSeek R1Cloud / LocalAPI and SDKCost-efficient large-scale codingCompetitive performance, local optionSmaller ecosystem\nOpen-source models (Qwen, StarCoder, etc.)Local / Self-hostedVariousPrivacy-first or custom useControl, modifiabilitySetup complexity, maintenance\n\nDisclaimer: models listed reflect those available at the time the research concluded and may not represent the most recent versions.\n\n\n\nPricing and total cost of ownership (TCO) comparison\n\nModel typeCost profileScaling considerations\nGPT familyUsage-based, higher per-token costScales well but requires budget planning\nClaude familyUsage-based, mid-to-high costEfficient for long-context tasks\nGeminiBundled cloud pricingOptimized for cloud environments\nDeepSeekLower usage costsAttractive for frequent queries\nOpen-sourceInfrastructure-dependentNo license fees, higher ops cost\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next section builds on this by presenting a clear framework for objectively evaluating these models.\nEvaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\nSelecting an AI coding assistant requires balancing multiple factors rather than optimizing for a single metric, a reality reflected in any meaningful comparison of AI coding assistants. Accuracy, speed, cost, integration, and security all play a role, and their relative importance depends on whether the tool is used for personal productivity, enterprise compliance, or research and experimentation when identifying the best AI for software development.\nDevelopers surveyed in the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 consistently cited code accuracy and IDE integration as top priorities when evaluating LLMs. However, organizational users also emphasized governance, transparency, and scalability as part of a broader AI model assessment.\nCore evaluation criteria for AI coding assistants\n\nCriterionWhy it mattersHow to assess\nAccuracy and reasoningDetermines the reliability of code suggestions, explanations, and test generationCompare model output on real codebases or benchmark problems\nIntegration and workflow fitEnsures smooth adoption inside IDEs and CI/CD pipelinesVerify compatibility with JetBrains IDEs, VS Code, or API connectors\nCost and scalabilityAffects accessibility for individual and organizational usersReview token pricing, API quotas, or enterprise licensing\nSecurity and data privacyProtects proprietary code and complies with organizational standardsCheck data retention policies, encryption, and local deployment options\nContext length and memoryImpacts how well the model understands complex projects or filesEvaluate maximum input size and conversational continuity.\nCustomization and fine-tuningEnables adaptation to specific domains or internal librariesDetermine whether the model allows prompt tuning, embeddings, or private training\nTransparency and governanceImportant for auditability and complianceConfirm whether logs, audit trails, and explainability tools are available\n\n\n\n\n\nThese criteria underscore a fundamental choice developers must make between open-source and proprietary AI models, discussed in the next section.\nOpen-source vs. proprietary models\nAI coding assistants generally fall into two categories: open-source or locally deployed models and commercial, cloud-managed models. A choice between them affects everything from data handling to performance and maintenance.\nThe JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025 showed that most developers rely on cloud-based proprietary AI coding tools, but a growing segment preferred local or private deployments due to security and compliance requirements. This group increasingly turned to local LLMs for coding and leveraged open-source models.\nGeneral industry patterns, specifically when it comes to a comparison of AI platforms, suggest there are different reasons behind this choice. Teams that choose open-source AI models for coding often seek transparency, customization, and infrastructure control. Proprietary models, on the other hand, offer faster onboarding, reliability, and vendor-managed updates.\nWhile there is no single “best” option, the selection of either an open-source or proprietary model comes down to organizational priorities such as compliance, scalability, and available DevOps resources. The following comparison table summarizes each type’s advantages, limitations, and best-fit scenarios.\nComparison of open-source and proprietary AI coding models\n\nTypeAdvantagesLimitationsBest fit\nOpen-source / Local models (e.g. StarCoder, Qwen, DeepSeek Local)Full control of infrastructure and data, ability to customize and fine-tune, no recurring license feesRequires setup and maintenance effort; updates and security are handled internally; performance may depend on local hardwareTeams with strong DevOps capabilities or strict data-governance requirements\nProprietary / Managed models (e.g., GPT-5, Claude 3.7, Gemini Pro)Fast setup, robust integrations, vendor-handled compliance, predictable performance, and enterprise supportCosts scale with usage; potential vendor lock-in; less transparency in training dataIndividual developers and growing teams focused on speed and reduced operational overhead\n\nDisclaimer: models listed reflect those available at the time of research conclusion and may not represent the most recent versions.\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have explored the various models open to developers, we will examine enterprise-readiness and security and consider how organizations evaluate governance, compliance, and reliability when adopting AI coding solutions.\nEnterprise readiness and security\nEnterprise AI coding tools must meet requirements far beyond accuracy or productivity gains. Security, compliance, and governance also play a decisive role.\nAccording to the JetBrains Developer Ecosystem Report 2025, many companies hesitated to adopt AI coding tools due to concerns about data privacy, IP protection, and model transparency.  These need to be addressed to ensure secure AI for developers.\nTo achieve this, enterprise-ready AI models typically offer flexible deployment, role-based access control, encryption, audit logs, policy enforcement, and AI governance and compliance.\nSome tools, such as JetBrains AI Assistant, support both cloud and on-premises integration, which suits teams that need a balance between agility and compliance. The table below also summarizes the capabilities and example tools required to create enterprise-ready LLMs.\nEnterprise evaluation matrix for AI coding tools\n\nCapabilityWhy it mattersExample tools\nDeployment flexibilityEnterprises need to control where data and models run to meet compliance and integration requirementsTeamCity, JetBrains AI Assistant (self-hosted), GitLab, DeepSeek Local\nRole-based access control (RBAC) and SSOCentralizes identity management and reduces risk of unauthorized accessJetBrains AI Assistant, Harness, GitLab\nAudit and traceabilitySupports compliance with ISO, SOC, and internal governance auditsTeamCity, Jenkins (plugins), JetBrains AI Assistant\nPolicy as code / ApprovalsEnables automated enforcement of deployment and review policiesHarness, GitLab, TeamCity\nData privacy and encryptionProtects source code and proprietary data during inference or storageJetBrains AI Assistant, Claude 3.7 (enterprise), DeepSeek Local\nDisaster recovery and backupsMinimizes downtime and preserves continuity in case of system failuresJetBrains Cloud Services, GitLab Self-Managed\nCompliance standardsEnsures alignment with SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, or regional equivalentsJetBrains AI Assistant, GitLab, Harness\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we understand how to create an enterprise evaluation matrix, the next section will explain how teams can choose the right AI coding model based on their specific needs, balancing control, speed, and compliance.\nHow to select the right AI coding model for you\nThe best AI for developers depends on context.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we build tools that help teams work with complex systems in a more productive and enjoyable way. As AI becomes part of everyday workflows, a new challenge is emerging for data teams: How can you enable AI-assisted analytics without sacrificing accuracy, transparency, or control over data?\nToday, we’re introducing Databao, a new data product from JetBrains designed to bring reliable semantic context to data teams, with the ability to build your own AI agents on top of it. We’re aiming to build an AI-native analytics tool that business users can rely on, alongside the dashboards that teams use every day.\nAs part of this work, we invite data teams to get in touch with us and launch a Proof of Concept to enable self-serve analytics for business users, discuss your team needs and share feedback throughout the journey. \n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nWhy Databao?\nDatabao’s mission\nModern data workflows are evolving quickly. Teams need flexibility and scalability as AI becomes a core part of how insights are generated. Sharing and reusing domain context, trusting AI-generated results, and scaling analytics without increasing complexity are some of the main challenges for companies.\nDatabao was built to solve practical problems that data teams face nowadays:\nEnabling business users to ask their own data questions in plain language.\nRelying on consistent, governed business definitions across analyses.\nGetting more accurate, repeatable results from AI-assisted workflows.\nReducing manual back-and-forth and ad-hoc requests.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn practice, this means enabling personalized, self-service analytics that are controllable, scalable, and continuously improve over time.\nProviding a self-maintaining semantic layer for companies’ data\nDatabao’s CLI tool, the context engine, is designed to extract schema and metadata from data sources and give teams a governed layer that captures business logic and definitions from databases, BI tools, and documentation. This keeps context consistent and reusable.\nAs one of our Alpha users puts it:\n“Before the context engine, I had to copy and paste my database schema into the LLM. Now I just point it to the data source and ask it to generate a query – and it works. No more incorrect column types, format mismatches, or hallucinations.”\nEnabling agentic analytics\nIn addition to the context engine, the data agent, available as an open-source and local Python SDK, uses this context to enable users to query, clean, and visualize enterprise data, generating production-quality SQL and outputs that business users can trust.\nAnother of our early users shared: “The Databao agent joined three to four tables perfectly, which no other data agent can do. I’m literally happy with this.”\nThe platform that brings it all together\nDatabao is designed for teams and the people who implement and own data tooling: analytics leads, data engineers, and platform teams.\nIt starts with a simple local setup and grows naturally as usage and complexity increase. From the first open-source building blocks, we are now evolving into a team-ready SaaS layer that brings shared context, collaboration, and production-grade reliability.\nBy avoiding vendor lock-in, working across tools, and adapting to different organizational setups, we also aim to make our platform suitable for any production environment, not just for experimentation.\n\n\n\n\nDatabao’s trust milestones\nOver the past year, we’ve focused on understanding how structured context and a semantic layer can improve the accuracy of agentic answers. This research has informed the foundations of Databao and how we started building our product.\nAs a result, we recently reached two important milestones: achieving a first-place ranking in the DBT track of the SPIDER 2.0 Text-to-SQL benchmark – one of the most widely recognized evaluations for SQL generation – and joining the Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), an open-source initiative led by Snowflake and other industry leaders to define a shared, vendor-neutral standard for semantic models.\nLet’s turn AI analytics into a working POC, together\nWe are excited to invite teams to build a proof of concept together with the Databao team. We’ll work with you to understand your use case, define a context-building process, and give the agent access to a selected group of business users. Together, we’ll then evaluate the quality of the responses and overall satisfaction with the results.\n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nAnd if you’d like to explore Databao, you can already try both our context engine and data agent through our open-source libraries.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "At JetBrains, we love seeing the developer community grow and thrive. That’s why we support open-source projects that make a real difference – the ones that help developers learn, build, and create better software together. We’re proud to back open-source maintainers with free licenses and contribute to initiatives that strengthen the ecosystem and the people behind it.\nIn this edition of the Open Source in Focus blog posts series, we spotlight four projects across the .NET ecosystem – each is a good reminder that developer experience is what makes ambitious projects sustainable over time.\nAvalonia UI: Cross-platform .NET UI toolkit\nAvalonia is an open-source, cross-platform UI framework for building .NET applications. It was launched in 2013 as an attempt to reimplement WPF as an open-source project and has grown steadily over time. The team notes it started gaining mindshare in 2021 and has continued to see significant adoption growth since then.\nOur contributors work on all supported desktop platforms: we have some working on macOS full time, some on Linux, and some on Windows. The only IDE that works on all of these platforms is JetBrains Rider. It’s an additional bonus that Rider also has the best Avalonia XAML support out there.\nSteven Kirk, Avalonia creator\nWhat’s next: The team’s goal is to keep pushing Avalonia to be “the leading .NET UI toolkit.” They’ve recently released Avalonia Accelerate with phased rollout plans – the first phase includes new Developer Tools, Media Player, and native WebView controls. Later phases will include a packaging tool, a GUI designer, and more. The team is also working on v12, with more news expected in the coming months.\nMudBlazor: .NET-first Blazor component library\nMudBlazor started when its founders were contributing to other Blazor component libraries and ran into architectural limitations and instability – coding felt like fighting against hidden JavaScript logic, and there was no extensive unit test coverage. \nThe creators set out to build a developer-friendly .NET component library, with most functionality written in C#, using JavaScript only when absolutely necessary. The result is a library with 90% test coverage, designed to be stable, well-tested, and easy to debug.\nReSharper has been incredibly helpful in spotting issues in MudBlazor: NullReferenceExceptions, unused values, expressions that are always null, etc. I rely heavily on the Unit Test Explorer and Localization Manager.\nAdditionally, dotMemory and dotPeek have been invaluable tools for us, especially in tricky cases when users report performance issues or large memory usage. These tools were particularly helpful in improving the performance of our popover system, which had previously experienced problems.\nArtyom Melnikov, MudBlazor maintainer\nFor me personally, ReSharper with its included test runner is the most important tool when working on MudBlazor. It’s a huge productivity booster, as it automatically adds usages, suggests simplifications, highlights unused code, and underlines potential errors. I use it extensively for refactoring whole files or projects. My favorite key combination is Ctrl+T, which lets you jump to a certain type. In a big source base like MudBlazor, this saves a huge amount of time.\nAlso, dotCover played a huge role for us in our efforts to increase test coverage. I used it to discover untested code regions and to measure the coverage of methods, classes, or entire modules quickly and effectively.\nMeinrad Recheis, MudBlazor co-creator\nWhat’s next: The team describes MudBlazor as “very mature”, with an emphasis on keeping complexity limited and the library maintainable by a small team. They expect substantial refactoring ahead to address internal design issues – and say they can do it safely thanks to ReSharper and high test coverage.\nLINQ to DB: LINQ-based data access library\nThe first code that eventually became LINQ to DB dates back to 2002. It started as a simple object mapper and later evolved into a library called BLToolkit. After LINQ support arrived in .NET, the team built a custom LINQ provider and, in 2012, redesigned the approach by extracting the LINQ-related parts into a standalone library: LINQ to DB, which is now a mature, high-performance data access library.\nJetBrains IDEs play a critical role in our daily workflow. Rider and ReSharper help us keep our large and complex codebase clean and consistent. Their static analysis, code inspections, and navigation features make it easy to spot issues early and refactor safely. They’re especially helpful when dealing with complex expression tree transformations and query generation logic. \nDataGrip is our go-to tool for interacting with databases during development and debugging. Its support for multiple RDBMSs and rich SQL capabilities align perfectly with LINQ to DB’s multi-database nature, making testing and validation much smoother. \nFor testing and performance, we rely on dotCover to ensure our unit tests provide thorough coverage of edge cases and expression scenarios. dotMemory helps us detect and fix memory leaks and inefficiencies, which is especially important for long-running data operations. dotTrace has been instrumental in turning LINQ to DB into the high-performance library it is today. Without it, we simply couldn’t have optimized the expression translation pipeline and query execution paths to the level they are at now.\nIgor Tkachev, LINQ to DB creator\nWhat’s next: The team is working on improving the expression tree translation engine to support more advanced LINQ constructs and custom expressions. Better diagnostics, deeper Roslyn-based source generation, and more consistent cross-database behavior are also on the roadmap. Long-term, the team aims for tighter integration with modern .NET features and better usability in async and high-throughput scenarios – without compromising performance.\nPeachPie: PHP compiler for .NET\nPeachPie (originally called Phalanger) began nearly 20 years ago as an experimental effort to translate PHP into Common Intermediate Language and run it on the .NET runtime, with the hypothesis that this could improve performance and security. Today, the team notes that people use PeachPie for hybrid apps in PHP and C#, including scenarios like WordPress on the frontend with a C# backend in a single project.\nWe’re experimenting with Rider, trying to support PeachPie PHP/.NET applications in the IDE, providing IntelliSense, design-time analyses, debugging via CLR Debugger, etc.\nJakub Míšek, PeachPie creator\nWhat’s next: Future development is focused on big-picture milestones, such as getting Laravel or Symfony to run on .NET, supported by the smaller functionality, library work, and bug fixes needed along the way.\nFrom our perspective, the most encouraging pattern across these stories is how much maintainability depends on everyday developer ergonomics: safer refactors, strong diagnostics, fast navigation, and tooling that helps teams validate changes with confidence. \nIf you’re using any of these projects, consider sharing feedback, filing an issue, or contributing a small improvement – Rider is free for open-source development and ready to help you code, collaborate, and contribute. \nDiscover more from this series",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Qodana is a static code analysis tool that brings code inspections and quick-fixes from JetBrains IDEs to the realm of continuous integration. It can be run in the cloud, executed from a Docker container, integrated into CI/CD pipelines, or invoked through a JetBrains IDE.\nQodana already offers an impressive suite of inspections, but it is not limited to what comes built in. You can add custom inspections to enforce project specifics and conventions.\nFor example, imagine a project with a specific code convention:\nEach Kotlin class in a service package must have a Service suffix.\nIn this case, com.jetbrains.service.JetComponent would not conform to this convention, while com.jetbrains.service.BrainComponentService would be perfectly fine. In what follows, we’ll build a plugin that implements this inspection, allowing Qodana to enforce this convention in future projects.\nWe can implement this code convention by creating a custom code inspection packaged in a plugin. Qodana plugins are developed just like JetBrains IDE plugins, which is to say we simply need to create an IntelliJ Platform plugin that can be run in Qodana. Here’s a quick overview of the steps we’ll take:\nInitialize the project from the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template.\nAdjust the project properties and plugin descriptor along with necessary dependencies.\nDeclare the local inspection in the plugin descriptor and implement it in Kotlin.\nBuild and package the plugin.\nIn the example playground project, put the plugin artifact into a proper directory.\nAdjust the Qodana configuration file.\nRun Qodana and look at the report!\nPreparing the plugin project\nTo bootstrap the project, visit the IntelliJ Platform Plugin Template repository and click the Use this template button to create a plugin repository. Name it classname-inspection-qodana-plugin, copy the project URL, and open it in IntelliJ IDEA. When the project is ready, customize gradle.properties by declaring the pluginGroup, pluginName, and pluginRepositoryUrl as necessary. Remember to click the Sync Gradle Changes floating button to apply the changes. To modify the unique plugin identifier, change the id element in the plugin descriptor plugin.xml.\nDeclaring dependencies\nOur code inspection targets Kotlin classes, so we need to add the Kotlin plugin to the Qodana plugin’s dependencies. The gradle.properties file requires you to declare:\nplatformBundledPlugins = org.jetbrains.kotlin\nIn addition, the plugin descriptor plugin.xml must contain the same bundled Kotlin plugin in its dependencies:\n<depends>org.jetbrains.kotlin</depends>\nAgain, remember to sync Gradle changes by clicking the floating button.\nIn addition, the Kotlin class inspection needs to support the Kotlin K2 Compiler, which has been enabled by default since version 2025.1 of the IntelliJ Platform. In the plugin descriptor, declare the org.jetbrains.kotlin.supportsKotlinPluginMode extension.\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"org.jetbrains.kotlin\">\n    <supportsKotlinPluginMode supportsK2=\"true\" />\n</extensions>\nCreating the code inspection\nThe actual code for any code inspection that targets Kotlin classes requires three steps:\nDeclare a com.intellij.localInspection extension in the plugin descriptor along with the necessary attributes and a fully qualified reference to the implementation class.\nCreate an implementation class, preferably in Kotlin.\nProvide a standalone HTML file with an inspection description, usage guidelines, and an example.\nDeclaring the extension\nAdd the following declaration to the plugin.xml plugin descriptor file:\n<extensions defaultExtensionNs=\"com.intellij\">\n    <localInspection\n        language=\"kotlin\"\n        implementationClass=\"org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\"\n        enabledByDefault=\"true\"\n        displayName=\"SDK: Discouraged class name\"\n        groupName=\"Kotlin\"\n    />\n</extensions>\nThe language attribute indicates that the inspection applies to Kotlin source code files. It is important to explicitly enable the inspection by default; otherwise, Qodana will not run it. Then provide a human-readable descriptive displayName to be shown in the report and settings. The groupName attribute sets the inspection category that is shown both in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings. Finally, provide a fully qualified name for the implementation class.\nCode inspection source code\nThe Kotlin plugin provides a useful base inspection class for Kotlin inspections: AbstractKotlinInspection. Override the buildVisitor method and provide a PSI visitor instance that traverses the Kotlin class elements in a type-safe way. classVisitor is a convenient DSL-like function that returns this kind of PSI visitor and is invoked on any Kotlin class in the project you’re inspecting.\npackage org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection\n\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemHighlightType\nimport com.intellij.codeInspection.ProblemsHolder\nimport com.intellij.psi.PsiElementVisitor\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeinsight.api.classic.inspections.AbstractKotlinInspection\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtClass\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.KtVisitorVoid\nimport org.jetbrains.kotlin.psi.classVisitor\n\nclass ServicePackageClassNameInspection : AbstractKotlinInspection() {\n    override fun buildVisitor(holder: ProblemsHolder, isOnTheFly: Boolean) = classVisitor { klass ->\n        val classNamePsi = klass.nameIdentifier ?: return@classVisitor\n        val classFqn = klass.fqName?.asString() ?: return@classVisitor\n        if (klass.packageLastComponent == \"service\" && !classFqn.endsWith(\"Service\")) {\n            holder.registerProblem(\n                classNamePsi,\n                \"Class name in the 'service' package must have a 'Service' suffix\"\n            )\n        }\n    }\n\n    private val KtClass.packageLastComponent: String\n        get() = containingKtFile.packageFqName.shortName().asString()\n}\nThe visitor subclass extracts the fully qualified Kotlin class name, inspects the rightmost package element, and checks the corresponding suffix. Any improper class name is reported to the ProblemsHolder instance with an enclosing class as a PSI element and a human-readable problem description.\nInspection description\nEach local inspection requires a companion description file, represented as HTML. If you use the Create description file ServicePackageClassNameInspection.html quick-fix, a file named src/main/resources/inspectionDescriptions/ServicePackageClassName.html will be created in the proper location. You’ll also have to provide a description that will be shown in the Qodana report and in the IDE settings.\n<html>\n<body>\nReports class names in the <code>service</code> packages that lack the <code>Service</code> suffix.\n<p><b>Example:</b></p>\n<pre><code>\n  package com.example.foo.service\n  class SomeComponent {\n    /* class members */\n  }\n</code></pre>\n</body>\n</html>\nBuild the plugin\nYou’re all set – time to build! Execute the buildPlugin Gradle task and look at the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip artifact available in the Gradle output directory. The JAR file will be used as the primary artifact in the Qodana scan. \nKeep the plugin artifact type in mind\nQodana does not directly support local ZIP plugin artifacts that include additional JAR archives or third-party dependencies. Any plugin needs to be packaged as a single JAR or unzipped into a specific directory.\nRun Qodana on a playground project\nLet’s create a playground project, written in Kotlin, that we can inspect with Qodana now that we’ve extended it with our plugin. To run the Qodana plugin locally, make sure that two software components are available on your system:\nDocker\nQodana CLI\nOur playground project should contain a class called src/main/kotlin/org/intellij/sdk/qodana/service/SomeComponent.kt, which does not follow our code convention, as it does not have the Service suffix. There are two ways to integrate the Qodana plugin into Qodana:\nPublish it on JetBrains Marketplace\nFor quicker turnaround, put the plugin’s JAR artifact into your project’s .qodana directory.\nTo simplify the build, copy the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file from the plugin project to the .qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.zip file in the playground project. Create the .qodana directory, if it does not yet exist. Then extract the archive with your preferred program or tool. Qodana is able to access the plugin in the build/distributions/qodana-code-inspection directory.\nIn addition, Qodana needs to be configured to include our custom code inspection. Change the qodana.yaml file in the root directory of the playground project as follows:\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\ninclude:\n  - name: org.intellij.sdk.codeInspection.ServicePackageClassNameInspection\nThe include block needs to refer to the fully qualified class name of the code inspection available in the plugin. Now execute the following command to run Qodana from the terminal:\nqodana scan --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/qodana-code-inspection\nThis will download the corresponding Qodana Docker image. A Docker container will be created and run based on the Qodana configuration. To make the custom plugin accessible inside the Qodana run, mount the Qodana plugin directory from the local filesystem to the appropriate directory inside the Qodana Docker container. After a couple of minutes, Qodana will produce a report summary and print it to the standard output.\nQodana - Detailed summary                                                                                                                                                                                                                \nAnalysis results: 1 problem detected                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nBy severity: High - 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nName                           Severity  Problems count                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------                                                                                                                              \nSDK: Discouraged class name    High      1                                                                                                                                                             \n-------------------------------------------------------\nOpen the full report in your browser:\n  Do you want to open the latest report [Y/n]Yes\n\n!  Press Ctrl+C to stop serving the report\n\n\\  Showing Qodana report from http://localhost:8080/... (10s)\nQodana will show that SomeComponent does not conform to the code convention provided by our local inspection in the Qodana plugin.\n\n\n\n\nTips for future runs\nWhen the Qodana plugin is modified and rebuilt, the Qodana cache needs to be recreated as well. In such cases, use the --clear-cache CLI switch to reload all of the Qodana run’s dependencies.\nqodana scan --clear-cache --volume $PWD/.qodana/qodana-code-inspection-0.0.1.jar:/opt/idea/custom-plugins/codeinspection.jar\nPlugging Qodana into your IDE\nThe Qodana plugin can be installed from disk into the IDE. Its code inspection is then automatically enabled and invoked for any Kotlin class in a project. To check that it’s working, revisit the playground project, open the org.intellij.sdk.qodana.service.SomeComponent class, and make sure that the problematic class name is underlined. As a convenience, hovering the mouse on the class name will show the code inspection result along with the problem description. Alternatively, you can open the Problems tool window and find the problem in the list of all problems reported by code inspections. \nThe code inspection now behaves like any other inspection provided by the IDE. In Settings | Editor | Inspections | Kotlin, you’ll find the SDK: Discouraged class name inspection, along with the description sourced from the HTML file that we provided before.\nRunning Qodana within the IDE\nWith the plugin installed, you can now run Qodana from your IDE as well. In the Problems tool window, go to the Qodana tab, and click the Try Locally button. Qodana will be configured with the qodana.yaml file and run. The Qodana report can be found directly in the tool window. \n\n\n\n\nQodana plugins and JetBrains Marketplace\nProperly built and tested custom inspection plugins can be published on JetBrains Marketplace, removing the need to serve them from the .qodana directory. Instead, you just need to make sure that the Qodana configuration specifies a public plugin identifier that matches the id element in the plugin descriptor.\nversion: \"1.0\"\nlinter: qodana-jvm-community\nplugins: \n  - id: com.github.novotnyr.qodanacodeinspection\nQodana’s scan command is simplified, as the .qodana directory mount is no longer necessary.\nqodana scan\nQodana downloads this plugin from JetBrains Marketplace and runs all its inspections, producing both console output and an HTML report that can be shown in a web browser.\nSummary\nWe have created a Qodana plugin with a code inspection that checks for a specific code convention, and we have a handful of ways to run it:\nAs a JAR placed in the .qodana directory and included in the Qodana YAML file.\nAs a reference to the publicly available plugin on JetBrains Marketplace.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is applied in a local Qodana run.\nAs a JAR installed in the IDE, where the inspection is included among the integrated code inspections. \nSee the IntelliJ SDK Code sample for concise examples of both the Qodana plugin and a playground project",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "February is a strange little month. Short, quiet, and typically uneventful. There are fewer distractions and fewer launches, which makes it the ideal time to slow down and take a look at what is actually driving the tech world at the moment.\nThis issue leans into that calm, with Trisha Gee joining us as our featured content guest and sharing her thoughts and observations on the latest Java news and how it’s shaping developers’ lives. We explore where Java is heading next, what running on the latest LTS really means, and how the platform keeps improving without chasing hype. Add in some practical tutorials, Kotlin updates, AI gradually becoming capable of more and more everyday development tasks, and a few thoughtful takes along the way, and you have a February read that is relaxed in tone, but rich in ideas. \nLet’s go! \nFeatured Content\nTrisha Gee\nTrisha Gee is a Java Champion, author, and internationally recognized speaker with over two decades of experience in software development. Known for her deep expertise in Java, high-performance systems, and developer productivity, Trisha has worked as a developer and leader in organizations ranging from startups to global enterprises. She’s passionate about sharing knowledge and helping developers write more expressive and efficient code.\nTrisha is the author of multiple technical books, including Head First Java (3rd Edition) and Getting to Know IntelliJ IDEA, and she frequently contributes to developer communities through blogs, webinars, and international conferences. She’s also a strong advocate for grassroots learning and regularly supports local user groups and meetups to help developers connect, grow, and thrive. When she’s not writing or coding, she’s championing inclusive practices and mentoring the next generation of developers.\nHappy February, dear readers of Java Annotated Monthly! For those of us in the northern hemisphere, the words “Happy” and “February” do not usually go together. However, I do see the upside of the dark months of January and February, mostly in that things are fairly quiet, travel (for me) is usually limited, and it’s a time to take stock of how you want the rest of the year to go.\nSo let’s look at Java (weird, for a Java newsletter). We now know the list of features coming in Java 26. Java 25, the current version, is the latest LTS, so although you may not be ready to look at Java 26 yet, you should be running on Java 25. It’s incredible to me that Java is still evolving after all these years, and in elegant and useful ways. In Data-Oriented Programming for Java: Beyond Records, Brian Goetz talks about how data can best be represented in Java, and specifically what carrier classes are. I’m always fascinated by how the language evolves and how the engineers decide which features to add or update (like records or carrier classes). If you are too, you should watch this interview with Georges Saab. He also talks about the value of learning (I learned fairly recently that “Hello World” in Java is much simpler to write thanks to new language features). Watch Marit demonstrate them in IntelliJ IDEA. And if you are keen to expand your IntelliJ IDEA/JetBrains IDE knowledge to expert level, maybe you’ll be interested in JetBrains’ Productivity With IntelliJ IDEA full-day workshop, which is led by me!\nI mentioned travel earlier in this piece – sadly I will not be going to JavaOne this year, which is super disappointing. JavaOne is where I got started with presenting at conferences, and it’s a place where I always meet interesting people, whether they are speakers, engineers working on Java itself, Java Champions, Java User Group leaders, or attendees there to learn something new. Tickets are still available, so I recommend taking a look.\nThat’s all from me! Remember, February is short, and it’ll be spring soon.\nJava News\nFresh releases, future plans, and the inside story from the Java team.

She brings over two decades of industry experience to Airbnb, including work spanning the stack from the frontend to the backend to the plumbing that makes everything come together. Anna is a mother, a passionate trail runner, and an accomplished leader. Here’s Anna’s story in her own words.\n\nDiscovering a passion after the Soviet Union\nI grew up in Eastern Ukraine, and the year I was graduating from high school, the Soviet Union collapsed. Despite the political turmoil, it was an interesting time to get into technology, and I have my brother to thank for that.\nI was always a nerdy kid, at school and at home, and my older brother really stoked that curiosity. He was studying computer hardware in Moscow, and he’d bring home computer parts to play with. I still remember the first computer he’d assembled, which required a cassette player to load programs. Only after many minutes of buzzing and clicking would the computer finally whirr to life.\nThinking back, that was really my first inspiration to work in technology. Seeing the inner workings of this new thing, a computer, and watching how the parts came together to form a whole — that’s what made me realize I wanted to work with computers, too.\nOf course, I didn’t know the Soviet Union would end, which made studying in Moscow impossible. But technology was still my future.\nEnglish: Harder than any programming language\nI got my start learning programming in a local Ukrainian university, and after four years of studying, I immigrated to America.\nWhen I arrived, I knew how to program, and I knew how to write and read English, but I couldn’t communicate well. I took ESL classes at a community college and, in parallel, enrolled in Berkeley Extension classes to advance my C++ knowledge and learn Java, which was still very new at the time.\nThroughout my first couple of jobs, I was more likely to run into challenges with the English language rather than with programming languages.\nMy first job was in computer hardware diagnostics at a tiny company with only five engineers, where we communicated directly with hardware manufacturers. This was right before the dot-com bubble burst.\nI almost didn’t get the job, though. The interview process for this job included a written portion that tested my knowledge of key computer science terms before getting to solve the coding problems. Given my prior education, I knew all the terms, but I ran out of time because the language gap slowed me down. Luckily, my interviewer happened to be taking the same Java class at Berkeley, and when I explained what happened, he gave me the chance to come back. I finished the test, got the job, and the rest is history.\nIn subsequent jobs, I transitioned fully from C++ to Java, which became my primary programming language for many years. I eventually got the hang of speaking English more confidently, but for a while, it still felt like Russian was my first language, Java was my second, and English was only my third.\nGoing deeper in the stack and taking on leadership roles\nAt various times, my career often felt all over the place. But looking back, I see a trajectory I wasn’t aware of at the time. I started with a brief stint in hardware diagnostics, but after that, I worked in the frontend and, over time, descended the software stack from frontend to backend to the deeper infrastructure I work with today.\nParallel to this trajectory down the stack was an upward trajectory in responsibility. Leadership wasn’t an obvious path for me at first — I had to be pitched multiple times — but the more I tried it, the more interesting and enjoyable it felt.\nWhen I worked at Caymas Systems, a telecom startup, my manager was quick to recognize my leadership potential. He was really encouraging, but even more encouraging was witnessing the difference between teams with good leaders and those without.\nAfter Caymas Systems, I worked at Comcast, where I eventually switched from an IC to an engineering manager. Once I experienced the joys of coaching people, building cool software together, and developing high-performing teams, I knew this was the path I wanted to take.\nFail whales and distributed systems\nThis path took me through a formative time in my career: the almost nine years I spent working at Twitter. I began as a first-line manager and, over time, worked through some of Twitter’s biggest events, including the “fail whale” era and the Ellen DeGeneres “selfie that broke Twitter” moment.\nThis was an exciting time. I was working at the heart of Twitter’s tech stack, supporting teams that powered its consumer and revenue verticals. This is where I grew into a senior manager and, eventually, a director. Looking back over nearly a decade of work, two major lessons stand out: one technical and one cultural.\nThe technical lesson was about failure — namely, its inevitability.\nOver my tenure, the Twitter stack transitioned from a monolith to a microservices architecture. This resulted in a set of robust, high-scale, low-latency distributed systems, and it was here that I learned that, when building resilient distributed systems, you need to design for failure, not hope to avoid it.\nI often think back to How Complex Systems Fail — the more complex a system, the more likely it is to fail. I remembered that lesson every time we were called to the Twitter command center to deal with an incident; it was all hands on deck until everything was back online.\nThe cultural lesson was about adoption and what it takes to fuel great ideas.\nToday, almost two-thirds of enterprises use GraphQL in production, but in its early days, it was a new, largely untested idea. During a hack week, a couple of engineers laid the groundwork for using this technology at Twitter. I worked closely with them and bootstrapped the team that eventually built Twitter’s GraphQL API, replacing the legacy REST services.\nI still think about this experience today. It required convincing leadership and building consensus across numerous teams and stakeholders, but once we did, the payoff was significant: this one technical choice accelerated the velocity of product feature teams across the company.\nWhy I picked Airbnb\nWhen Airbnb reached out in 2022, I realized my time at Twitter was coming to a close. By that point, my organization was well-run and high-performing — a success, but also a sign that I was ready for my next adventure.\nAirbnb immediately stood out because the company offered, for the first time in my career, a true alignment between my personal and technical interests. I love traveling, and I have been a long-time Airbnb guest since 2013. I had always wanted to work for a company that built a product I truly cared about, and this was my chance.\nI only got more excited when I learned about the people and teams I’d be working with. The Developer Platform organization, which was responsible for supporting all of Airbnb’s engineers, faced challenges I’d seen before. There was a lot of good work happening in silos, and folks were longing for a clear strategy and direction. Also, I saw an opportunity to not only improve developer experience but also build trust with the rest of the engineers and stakeholders.\nSo, I started at the beginning. We focused on setting up the organization, coaching leadership, and building internal alignment within the team, as well as external alignment across all the teams we supported. Fundamental questions like “Why are we here together?” and “Where are we going?” all had to be answered.\nAfter a year or two of this work, we had a high-performing team with a clear strategy and strong execution, consistently delivering business value and improving the developer experience and productivity at Airbnb. Even more importantly, we earned the rest of the engineers’ trust, and we enabled our technical teams to perform better.\nWe saw this reflected in the bi-annual DevX surveys (which we built out), and the results showed overall developer satisfaction increasing about 10% year over year during my time on the team.\nSolving new problems while working from anywhere\nToday, I’m Senior Director of Engineering for Application & Cloud Infrastructure, which includes compute, networking, core services, and the GraphQL application platform. Our mission is to deliver reliable, secure, and efficient platforms for building, operating, and scaling applications, services, and workloads at Airbnb.\nMy primary users are still the engineers at Airbnb. When they need to compute, they don’t wrangle AWS themselves — we provide a layer of abstraction that helps them use low-level infrastructure. Similarly, if they need authorization, authentication, configuration management, and a host of other services, they come to us rather than starting from scratch.\nI’m excited to come to work every day because of the people I get to work with and the opportunities we face together. The culture is excellent, the people are smart and collaborative, and the engineers we support appreciate the work we do.\nThe setup is empowering, too, and as you solve problems, you can grow and expand to tackle bigger problems that span teams and organizations. Add in the ability to work from anywhere, and for me, it feels like the sky is the limit.\nAs I look back on my career, and really, my entire life, I tend to see it now through the lens of long-distance trail running — a major hobby of mine.\nAfter working at a startup, having twins, and running my first marathon, I felt like I could do anything. At work and on the trails, I think about how to prepare for the journeys ahead and how to maintain a pace that allows me and the people around me to thrive in the long run. Recovery is necessary, but so is strategy, drive, discipline, and finding the people who will go with you as well as cheer you on along the way.\nI’m happy this path, as unpredictable as it has been, has taken me to Airbnb. Airbnb is in that ideal position between a startup and a long-established company. The systems and workflows are mature, but there are still many interesting problems to solve and opportunities to pursue. If that’s of interest to you, I encourage you to check out openings at Airbnb.\n\nMy Journey to Airbnb — Anna Sulkina was originally published in The Airbnb Tech Blog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Refactoring at scale is a time-consuming and error-prone process for developers. In large codebases, developers have relied on manual searches and incremental edits across multiple files to accomplish these tasks.\nModern development workflows depend on fast and accurate code navigation to avoid these pitfalls. When developers refactor existing code, explore unfamiliar areas of a large codebase, or make targeted changes, they naturally rely on IDE language service features such as Find All References, Go to Definition, and Go to Implementation to understand how code is structured and connected.\nAgent mode now has access to these same language-aware capabilities through the new find_symbol tool. This goes beyond traditional text or file search traditionally available in agent mode by enabling symbol-level reasoning powered by enterprise-grade language services.\n\nWhat is find_symbol?\nFind_symbol exposes rich, language-specific symbol information to Copilot Agent Mode, allowing the agent to reason about symbols (including functions, classes, interfaces, and variables).\nSpecifically, this tool allows Copilot agent mode to:\nView all references of a given symbol across the entire codebase\nUnderstand symbol metadata such as type, declaration, implementation, and scope\nThe find_symbol tool is available today in the latest Visual Studio 2026 Insiders version 18.4. Supported languages include: C++, C#, Razor, TypeScript, and any other language for which you have a supported Language Server Protocol (LSP) extension installed.\nFor best results, write clear prompts and use AI models that support tool-calling. Learn more at AI model comparison – GitHub Docs\nExample scenarios\nAll examples below were showcased using bullet3, an open-source C++ physics simulation engine.\nAdding additional functionality to existing code\nAs applications evolve, you often need to enhance existing functions without breaking current behavior. This can include adding logging or performance metrics.\nThese tools help the agent quickly identify all relevant references, ensuring complete and accurate updates for feature additions.\n\nAPI Refactoring\nRefactoring an API, such as hardening it, requires deep understanding of how the API is consumed across a codebase. With symbol-level insight, the agent can discover all usages, distinguish between call paths, and propose safe refactors with minimal breakage.\n\nTell us what you think\nWe appreciate the time you’ve spent reporting issues/suggestions and hope you continue to give us feedback when using Visual Studio on what you like and what we can improve. You can share feedback with us via Developer Community: report any bugs or issues via report a problem and share your suggestions for new features or improvements to existing ones.\nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on YouTube, X, LinkedIn, Twitch and on Microsoft Learn\n \nThe post Unlock language-specific rich symbol context using new find_symbol tool appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

POE 1 용병 리그\n용켓몬만으로도 너무 재밌었고, 역저항 날먹이 되다보니 탱도 되는 역저항으로 대동단결이 조금 아쉬웠지만, 디아 2부터 있던 용병으로 인한 2개의 템 세팅의 조합으로 인한 재미는 너무나 좋았다.\n    \n2달 가까이 돌았던 스발린 런에서 스발린을 못먹은건 아쉽지만…\n패시브 트리를 못찍음에도, 여러 버프만으로 오라봇을 통한 빌드까지 돌아가는 과정이 재밌었다\n본 서버 편입 예정이라고 들었는데, 역저항만 잘 막아도 꽤나 재밌는 기재가 많았던 만큼 재미를 크게 더 해줄수 있을 거란 기대가 된다.\n    \n2. POE 2 바알의 운명 리그\nPOE1 불길의 수호자 리그에서의 삿된 아이템 (고유템에서 특정 옵션 하나를 대체한 변성 아이템)에서 조금 더 틀어서, 확률이 더 들어갔고, 더블 커럽 (타락 2번으로, 홈 변경, 수치 변경, 옵션 부여가 최대 2번 가능)이 POE1 보다 편하게 도입되면서 재밌는 아이템이 많이 나왔다\n    \n물론 POE1보다 제한이 많은 역냉각, 그나마 공격은 흡수라도 되지만 주문 스킬 사용 시 코스트 제한이 큰 POE2의 제약을 풀어주는 계약 갑옷의 함양 옵션은 블러 메이지 어센던시가 얼마나 사기였는지 알 수 있었다.\n무한 불가능한 탈출, 히든 패시브 스킬 트리의 오라클도 재밌었고, 곰, 늑대, 와이번 드루이드도 꽤 재밌게 즐겼다.\n바알 사원이 POE1의 고난 리그 못지 않은 도파민 리그였고, 이를 막으려다가 롤백하는 등 사소한 이슈들이 있었지만, 역시 핵슬은 도파민이 리그 흥행에 도움이 된다는 것을 다시 한번 느끼게 됐다.\n    \n3. 디아블로 4 시즌 10\n오픈 베타 이후 아쉬움을 느껴 POE를 시작했고 라스트 에포크를 즐겼지만, 워낙 여러 영상에서 극찬이 많던 시즌이라 나도 즐기게 됐다.\n확실히 액트 구간을 빠르게 넘길 수 있고, 이로 인해 엔드 게임을 빠르게 진입할 수 있는 것은 장점이었지만, 직관적이고 빠르게 적응 가능한 시스템들도 많았던 데에 비해, 위상 같은 것은 번거롭기만 한 느낌도 지울 수 없었다.\n비약 같은 시스템은 MMORPG같은 느낌이 드는 버프도 있었는데, 또 어떤 부분은 핵슬의 기본 문법 스러운 포인트도 있고해서 나름 재밌게 즐겼다\n아이템 거래가 불편한 것만 아니었다면 좀 더 재밌게 즐겼을 듯\n    \n제발 거래소 좀..\n지향점 자체가 라이트한 핵앤 슬래시라는 게 느껴지긴 했으나, 그래도 좀 더 파고들기 요소가 있어야 되지 않을까?\n    \n올해의 워스트 게임\n1. POE 2 사냥의 서막\nPOE2 얼리억세스의 좋은 기세에 찬물을 끼얹은 시즌\n액트 시간이 단축되는 것을 못마땅하게 여겼는지, 가뜩이나 어렵던 액트 구간을 더 어렵게 만들었고, 이 과정에서의 이탈했고 나 역시 모든 POE2 시즌 중 일주일 남짓에 오프한 리그\n    \n특히 워리어 계열이 크게 고통 받았는데, 여러가지 반발이 많았고 이로 인해 허리띠에 호신부 슬롯 기본 부여, 전직 변경 가능을 비롯한 여러가지 개선이 이뤄진 전화위복 시즌이었다\n번개창으로 대동단결된 시즌이라, 시원시원하게 재밌게 즐긴 분도 많았겠지만, 시즌제 게임에서 초반이 얼마나 중요한지, 그 대응의 중요성도 느꼈던 시즌\n    \n2. 풋볼 매니저 26\n아직 버그가 너무 많다\n새로운 게임이 된 거 같지만, 잘 정돈되지 않은 느낌은 크게 아쉬웠음\n    \n할만은 하지만, 할만한 정도론 이전 버전을 플레이 하는게 낫지 않나 싶은 생각이 들었음\n        \n3. 몬스터 헌터 와일즈\n내가 굳이 언급하지 않아도 알겠지만, 여러 이슈로 인해 확장팩만 기다리는 사람이 산더미인 게임\n과연 확장팩에선 개과천선할 수 있을까?\n기억에 남는 게임\n1. 라스트 에포크 시즌 2, 3\n사실 아직 많이 모자르다\n    \n그래도 같은 직업군 내의 패시브를 혼합해서 찍을 수도 있고, 기본적 게임의 틀은 잘 완성된 형태여서 재밌게 즐겼다\n시즌 중에 발생한 거래소 한글 버그가 고쳐지지 않은 문제나, 패치마다 발생하는 소소한 버그가 너무 늦게 고쳐지는 이슈, 시즌 2 -3 간격도 빠른 편이라 보긴 어렵지만, 1-2의 간격, 3-4의 간격은 지나치게 길다는 점, 시즌 컨텐츠 양이 부족하다는 점 등은 아쉽다\n엔드 게임이 디아4보다는 풍부하지만 부족함이 많고, 컨텐츠 역시 갈길이 먼 측면이 있으며, 플레이 타임을 유지하기 위해서인지 한번 사용된 아이템은 각인되는데, 이로 인해 반복 노가다와 득템의 효율이 조금 아쉽다\n총평하자면 포텐은 증명했으나, 용이 되지 못했고, 발표한 플랜도 아쉬움이 크다.\n    \n그럼에도 관심을 놓자니 미련이 남는 게임\n        \n2. 토치 라이트 인피니트 SS10\n핵슬에 대한 이해도를 높일 겸사 겸사 시작했던 게임\n    \n널리 알려진거에 비해서 무료 캐릭으로 무료로 즐겨도 할만했음\n그래픽의 호불호는 나도 좀 있긴했지만, 생각보다 완성도 높은 게임이라서 놀라웠음\n왜 이 게임을 POE 다음 가는 수준의 깊이 있는 게임이라고 말하는지는 충분히 알았고, 이후에도 종종 타이밍 맞으면 즐길 게임\n    \n3. 엘더 스크롤 4 오블리비언 리마스터\n사실 원작이 발매됐던 시기에도 엑박버전이나 스팀 버전 등 여러번 샀음에도, 적응을 못하고 넘어갔었다\n이후 스카이림을 재밌게 즐겼으나, 굳이 구작을 즐기지 않았었는데 이번에 리마스터가 되면서 즐기게 됐다.\n아니 이런 명작을 놓쳤다니…? 이래서 오블리비언 오블리비언 얘기가 나왔고, 엘더 스크롤이 메이저 게임으로 한국에도 퍼진 계기였구나 싶은 감탄이 나왔던 게임\n올해의 영상\n1. 서울 자가에 대기업 다니는 김부장 이야기\n그 감정선이나 묘사가 너무 재밌었음\n나 역시 나이가 들어가는 입장에서 많이 공감되어야 하는거 아니냐고 말할 수도 있지만, 약간 과장되었거나, 공감이 안되는 내용이 꽤 있었다\n하지만 드라마로써의 완성도나 만족도는 충분했음\n    \n2. 중증외상센터\n여러 의학 드라마의 무게감보다 훨씬 명확하고 명쾌해서 좋았다\n    \n중증 외상 센터가 왜 필요한지에 대해서 알 수 있던 점은 덤\n깔끔한 전개로 즐겁게 볼 수 있었던 드라마\n    \n3. 경도를 기다리며\n오징어 게임의 세미역으로 나왔던 원지안 배우가 여주인공이었는데, 아주 매력적으로 나왔다\n약간 디테일은 많이 다르지만, 그 해 우리는 의 김다미 배우처럼, 작품과 딱 맞아떨어져 매력적으로 보였던 작품\n의외로 이런 저런 전개 과정이 멜로나, 로맨틱 코메디보다 재밌게 볼 수 있는 부분이 많아서 좋았다다\n올해의 아쉬운 드라마\n1. 오징어 게임 2, 3\n군계 일학이라 하나만 꼽겠음\n이유는 굳이 말 안해도 많은 사람들이 알거라 생각하지만…\n    \n무언가 기간 부족인지 1에 비해 떨어지는 디테일이 공감, 감정 이입을 방해했다\n        \n올해의 음악\n1. 프로미스 나인 - 하얀 그리움\n[fromis_9 (프로미스나인) - White Memories (하얀 그리움)\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251206방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXyVxWRjSco&list=RDfXyVxWRjSco&start_radio=1)\n        \n알아듣기 힘든 노래 속에, 옛날 김민종님의 90-00 감성이 살아나는 노래를 잘 살렸다\n2. NMIXX - Blue Valentine\n[NMIXX (엔믹스) - Blue Valentine\n          Show! MusicCore\n          MBC251018방송](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnUNpf0sgFE&list=RDVnUNpf0sgFE&start_radio=1)\n        \n이 노래 역시, 하얀 그리움처럼 잘 알아들을 수 있고 겨울 감성 살아있는 설레임 가득한 느낌이 드는 음악이어서 좋았다\n3. Behind the Moon - 밤의 끝자락\n밤의 끝자락 (Official Audio)\n시티팝? J-POP? 스러운 감성의 노래였는데 감성적으로 취향 저격이었음\n다만 Behind the Moon의 노래중 이 노래가 특히 좋았다는 점은 조금 아쉬웠음\n    \n김수영처럼 많은 노래가 비슷하게 취향 저격이었음 좋았을텐데…\n올해의 기술 주제\n1. LLM 쇼크, 바이브 코딩\nLLM의 발전이 기대보다 빠르게 진행되고 있다\n바이브 코딩과 함께 일정 수준 이하의 단순한 작업은 코드를 작성하지 않고도 가능해진 점은, 여러 분야의 생산성을 극대화 시킬 수 있는 부분이라고 보여진다\n물론 여전히 한계도 많고, 그 퀄리티의 제약도 많은 것은 당연한데, 이렇게 진행되다보면 개발자 무용론이 더 심해지지 않을까 우려도, 또 한편으로는 기회일 수도 있다는 생각도 든다\n    \n또 더 성장해야 된다는 생각 역시 들고 말이다\n        \n2. 메모리 가격 쇼크\n이게 왜 기술 주제냐하실 수 있는데, 메모리가 비싸지면 PC 시장이나, 서버 시장에도 영향을 줘서라고 말하고 싶다\n메모리 가격이 몇배씩 뛰면서, 게이머들의 PC 업그레이드 저항감은 더 커졌다\n    \n심지어 맥미니가 가성비라는 말 (원래도 어느정돈 그랬지만)이 더 공감을 얻고 있는데, 이러한 램 가격은 한동안 내려오지 않을 듯 하다\nSSD도 가격 인상중인데, 이 영향이 얼마나 커질까?\n또 게이머 관점에서도, 게임 개발자 관점에서도 PC 보급의 저항감이 낮아진 것은 우려가 되는 것은 사실이다\n    \n3. PostgreSQL의 강세, MySQL의 약세\n이러한 흐름은 몇년이나 지속 됐지만, 그 흐름이 더 커지는 명확한 시그널이 느껴진다\n오라클이 MySQL 커뮤니티, 개발을 유지할지에 대한 우려가 더 커지는 상황이 나오고 있고, 반면 PostgreSQL은 더 발전이 가속화 되는 상황이 이어지며, 이 흐름이 한국에서 얼마나 영향을 줄 지 궁금해진다.\n올해의 글\n1. AWS 버지니아 DDB 장애\nSummary of the Amazon DynamoDB Service Disruption in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) Region\n    \n실제 내가 서비스중인 프로덕트도 영향을 받았고, 이외에도 많은 제품이 영향을 받아 어떤 제품들이 AWS를 쓰고 있는지 알 수 있었음\n원인을 잘 설명해주긴 했으나, 결국 과도하게 복잡해진 시스템은 작은 오류도 복구가 쉽지 않아진다는 점은 크게 공감할 수 있었다\n        \n2. LLM과 함께라면 3달이 3일\nMariano Gappa’s Blog\n    \n사실 나 역시 토이 프로젝트나, 프로토타이핑 개발 시 단순한 기능의 구현이 떠오르지 않아 시간을 많이 소모한 일이 적지 않았다\n예를 들면, 그리드 기반 게임에서의 AStar라던지, 서버에서의 연산을 위한 경량 Raycast라던지, 투사체의 궤도라던지와 같은 로직들은 어떠한 동작을 원할 때 기능을 찾거나, 직접 구현하는 과정에서 많은 시간을 소모했다\n반면 이러한 수준의 작업은 아주 아주 쉬워진 상황이 나에게도 체감이 되고 있다.\n물론 상대적으로 게임은 바이브 코딩으로 최종 결과물이 안나오는 경우가 꽤 되지만, 이 역시 많이 해소 되고 있고, 더 가속화 될 거 같다.\n        \n다만 재미를 찾는 것은 여전히 사람의 영역이므로 이 부분에 경쟁력이 더 중요해져 가고 있다는 생각도 들었다\n            \n3. LLM 사용을 줄인 이유\nWhy I’m Dialing Back My LLM Usage — Zed’s Blog\n    \n요약하자면 보조적인 용도로 LLM을 써야 한다는 의미\n        \n나 역시 비슷한 의견을 가지고 있긴 하지만, 조금 더 그 생각을 명확히 드러내준 글이라고 볼 수 있겠다\nWhy I stopped using AI code editors · Luciano Nooijen\n    \n비슷한 의견\n        \nLLM을 사용하면 깊이 있는 생각과 통찰은 못 얻는 아쉬움을 대체하기 위해서, 기준을 정하고 사용한다는 의미\n            \n바이브 코딩으로 얻는 장단점을 명확하게 말한 듯 하다\n새해 바램\n건강\n다른 곳은 그래도 좀 괜찮았는데, 수면 장애랑 목이 너무 아프다\n    \n이 부분을 주기적으로 병원 가서 치료 받고 있지만, 아직은 좀 아파서 신경 쓰이는 상황\n        \n강아지\n초코가 그래도 많이 안아팠다\n    \n특히 돈은 많이 들어가고 있지만, 건강을 잘 챙기고 있게 되서 다행이다\n올해도 괜찮길\n파이는 여전히 건강하다\n    \n살만 안찌면 그래도 괜찮을 듯\n        \n여가 생활\n핵앤슬래시에 대한 이해가 크게 올라온 한해였다\n    \n대다수의 메이저 핵앤 슬래시를 모두 어느정도 수준까지 이해할 수 있게 됐다\n핵앤 슬래시 토이 프로젝트로 이어보고 싶은 개인적 바램이 있다\n        \n마치며\n매년 그렇듯, 건강도 잘 챙기고, 업무적 성취도 잘 이루고 싶다\n특히 매년 노력해온 건강, 토이 프로젝트와 함께 가족과의 시간도 더 잘 보내고 싶다\n핵앤 슬래시 게임을 로직적으로나 기획적으로는 어느정도 엿볼 수 있는 제품을 만들어보고 싶다\n다들 건강 잘 챙기시길!",

text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/youtube-ai-slop-removal/\">Android Police</a>가 보도한 내용에 따르면, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠, 즉 'AI 슬롭'에 대한 대대적인 정화 작업을 벌이고 있다고 해요. 이들의 분석은 온라인 영상 편집 회사인 Kapwing의 2025년 11월 보고서에 기반한 것인데, 정말 놀라운 결과가 나왔습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">보고서 발표 이후 불과 두 달 만에, Kapwing이 선정한 <b>상위 100개 AI 콘텐츠 채널 중 16개가 플랫폼에서 사라졌다고 합니다.</b> 이 16개 채널은 총 3천5백만 명의 구독자를 보유하고 있었으며, 무려 <b>47억 뷰가 넘는 조회수</b>를 기록했었어요. 단순히 영상만 삭제된 경우도 있지만, 아예 채널 자체가 사라진 사례도 상당수라고 하니, 유튜브의 의지가 얼마나 강력한지 짐작할 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히 눈에 띄는 것은 'CuentosFacianantes'라는 채널입니다. 595만 명의 구독자를 거느렸던 이 채널은 드래곤볼 관련 AI 생성 쇼츠로 2025년 말까지 12.8억 뷰를 쓸어 담았지만, 지금은 사라진 상태입니다. 이 외에도 587만 구독자의 'Imperio de Jesus', 421만 구독자의 'Super Cat League' 같은 대형 채널들도 함께 문을 닫았죠. 이쯤 되면 유튜브가 정말 작정하고 나섰다는 생각이 듭니다.</p>\n<div style=\"background-color: #e8f4fd;

color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">1. 인간적인 독창성과 통찰력을 더하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">AI는 데이터를 학습하고 패턴을 찾아내는 데는 탁월하지만, 고유한 경험, 감정, 그리고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 만들어내지는 못합니다. 여러분만의 시각, 분석, 혹은 개인적인 스토리를 AI 콘텐츠에 녹여내세요. 예를 들어, AI로 생성된 정보를 바탕으로 하더라도, 그 정보를 해석하고 독자에게 공감을 불러일으킬 만한 자신만의 서사를 추가하는 식이죠. 결국 사람의 마음을 움직이는 건 사람의 이야기 아니겠어요?</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">2. AI 사용의 투명성을 확보하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">유튜브는 2026년부터 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 <b>표시 의무</b>를 강화하고 있습니다. 이제 단순히 'AI가 만들었나?' 하고 의심받는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터 스스로 AI 사용 여부를 명확히 밝히는 것이 신뢰를 구축하는 핵심이 될 것입니다. 시청자들은 정직함을 더 높이 평가할 거예요. 저라면, 영상 시작이나 설명란에 '이 영상은 AI 기술의 도움을 받아 제작되었습니다'라고 명확히 밝힐 것 같아요.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">3. '양'보다 '질'에 집중하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">저품질 AI 슬롭이 넘쳐나는 시대에, 대량 생산은 더 이상 답이 아닙니다. 오히려 하나의 고품질 콘텐츠에 시간과 노력을 투자하는 것이 훨씬 효과적입니다. 좋은 프롬프트 엔지니어링, AI 결과물의 세심한 후반 작업, 그리고 인간의 검토와 편집은 필수적입니다. AI를 단순한 생산 도구로 생각하기보다, 여러분의 창의적인 비전을 실현하는 '협력자'로 활용해야 합니다.</p>\n<h3 style=\"font-size: 19px; color: #1a73e8; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 10px;\" data-ke-size=\"size23\">4. 커뮤니티와 적극적으로 소통하라</h3>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">진정성 있는 커뮤니케이션은 AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 영역입니다. 시청자의 댓글에 응답하고, 라이브 스트리밍을 통해 직접 소통하며, 설문조사 등을 통해 콘텐츠 기획에 참여시키는 것은 강력한 팬덤을 구축하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 결국 팬들은 AI가 아닌, 여러분이라는 <b>인간 크리에이터</b>와 소통하고 싶어 할 거예요.</p>\n<figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-filename=\"download.png\" data-origin-width=\"1344\" data-origin-height=\"768\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/dEEPEN/dJMcaiCdQcZ/rTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1/img.png\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FdEEPEN%2FdJMcaiCdQcZ%2FrTgVjq11NwjW6YgDD8LcJ1%2Fimg.png\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null; this.src='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png'; this.srcset='//t1.daumcdn.net/tistory_admin/static/images/no-image-v1.png';\" alt=\"지루하고 반복적인 AI 슬롭과 독창적이고 생동감 넘치는 고품질 AI 콘텐츠 흐름이 명확히 구분되는 추상적인 디지털 시각화.\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1344\" height=\"768\" data-filename=\"download.png\" data-origin-width=\"1344\" data-origin-height=\"768\"/></span></figure>\n\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 20px;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">정리하자면, 2026년 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에서 <b>'질'</b>과 <b>'인간적인 가치'</b>를 더욱 중요하게 여기는 방향으로 진화하고 있습니다. 아래 표를 통해 'AI 슬롭'과 '고품질 AI 콘텐츠'의 차이를 한눈에 비교해보세요.</p>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 20px; overflow-x: auto;\">\n<table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align: left; border: 1px solid #dadce0;\" data-ke-align=\"alignLeft\">\n<thead style=\"background-color: #e8eaed;\">\n<tr>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">항목</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">AI 슬롭</th>\n<th style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">고품질 AI 콘텐츠</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>주요 목표</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">조회수, 광고 수익 극대화</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">가치 제공, 시청자 만족, 브랜드 구축</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f1f3f4;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>콘텐츠 특징</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">반복적, 자극적, 의미 없음, 독창성 결여</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">독창적, 통찰력, 고품질 편집, 인간적 감성</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>AI 활용 방식</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">생성 도구에 전적으로 의존, 무단 사용</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">크리에이터의 비전을 돕는 보조 도구</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #f1f3f4;\">\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\"><b>플랫폼 반응</b></td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">삭제 및 채널 제재</td>\n<td style=\"padding: 12px 15px; border: 1px solid #dadce0; color: #3c4043;\">긍정적 평가, 노출 기회 증가</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div style=\"background-color: #f8f9fa; border: 1px solid #dadce0; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 25px; margin: 40px 0;\">\n<div style=\"font-size: 26px; color: #1a73e8; font-weight: bold; padding-bottom: 15px; border-bottom: 2px solid #1a73e8; margin-bottom: 20px;\">  핵심 요약</div>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">1. <b>유튜브는 저품질 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포했습니다.</b> 2026년 현재 수십억 뷰가 삭제되고 수많은 채널이 제재를 받았습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">2. 닐 모한 CEO는 AI를 <b>'표현의 도구'</b>로 보며, 유해하거나 질 낮은 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 강력한 조치를 예고했습니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">3. 크리에이터는 <b>인간적인 독창성, 투명성, 품질 중심 전략</b>으로 변화에 대응해야 합니다.</p>\n<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 17px; color: #3c4043;\" data-ke-size=\"size16\">4.

        "contentSnippet": "2026년, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠 '슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포하며 플랫폼의 질을 높이는 데 주력하고 있습니다. 크리에이터들은 어떻게 변화하는 유튜브 생태계에서 살아남아 고품질 AI 콘텐츠로 인정받고 성공할 수 있을까요? 단순히 AI가 생성한 '슬롭'을 넘어, 인간적인 통찰과 창의성이 담긴 콘텐츠로 시청자를 사로잡을 수 있는 핵심 전략을 이 글에서 자세히 소개합니다.\n\n\n요즘 유튜브 피드, 혹시 좀 달라진 것 같지 않으세요? 특히 로그인하지 않은 상태로 쇼츠를 보다 보면, 기이하고 반복적인 AI 콘텐츠들이 넘쳐나는 것을 느끼셨을 거예요. 아, 이런 걸 'AI 슬롭(AI Slop)'이라고 부르는데, 솔직히 좀 피곤하죠. 의미도 없고 재미도 없이 그저 조회수만 노리는 영상들이 너무 많아서, 저조차도 가끔은 피로감을 느끼곤 했습니다.\n그런데 2026년인 지금, 유튜브가 이 'AI 슬롭'과의 전면전을 선포했습니다. 제가 볼 때는, 이건 단순히 플랫폼의 정화 작업을 넘어 크리에이터들에게는 정말 중요한 변화의 시그널이에요. 과거에는 양으로 승부하는 시대였다면, 이제는 질과 진정성이 훨씬 더 중요해진 거죠. 대체 유튜브가 왜 이런 결정을 내렸고, 우리는 어떻게 이 변화에 발맞춰 나가야 할까요?\n⚔️ 유튜브, 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포하다\n최근 Android Police가 보도한 내용에 따르면, 유튜브는 저품질 AI 콘텐츠, 즉 'AI 슬롭'에 대한 대대적인 정화 작업을 벌이고 있다고 해요. 이들의 분석은 온라인 영상 편집 회사인 Kapwing의 2025년 11월 보고서에 기반한 것인데, 정말 놀라운 결과가 나왔습니다.\n보고서 발표 이후 불과 두 달 만에, Kapwing이 선정한 상위 100개 AI 콘텐츠 채널 중 16개가 플랫폼에서 사라졌다고 합니다. 이 16개 채널은 총 3천5백만 명의 구독자를 보유하고 있었으며, 무려 47억 뷰가 넘는 조회수를 기록했었어요. 단순히 영상만 삭제된 경우도 있지만, 아예 채널 자체가 사라진 사례도 상당수라고 하니, 유튜브의 의지가 얼마나 강력한지 짐작할 수 있습니다.\n특히 눈에 띄는 것은 'CuentosFacianantes'라는 채널입니다. 595만 명의 구독자를 거느렸던 이 채널은 드래곤볼 관련 AI 생성 쇼츠로 2025년 말까지 12.8억 뷰를 쓸어 담았지만, 지금은 사라진 상태입니다. 이 외에도 587만 구독자의 'Imperio de Jesus', 421만 구독자의 'Super Cat League' 같은 대형 채널들도 함께 문을 닫았죠. 이쯤 되면 유튜브가 정말 작정하고 나섰다는 생각이 듭니다.\n  'AI 슬롭(AI Slop)'이란?\n의미 있는 내용이나 독창성 없이 단순히 AI 도구를 이용해 대량으로 생성된, 저품질의 반복적이고 자극적인 콘텐츠를 지칭합니다. 주로 조회수나 광고 수익만을 목적으로 하며, 시청자에게 피로감만 안겨주는 경우가 많아요.\n\n\n  모한 CEO의 2026년 비전: AI, 도구인가 대체재인가?\n유튜브의 이러한 움직임은 닐 모한(Neal Mohan) CEO의 비전과 정확히 일치합니다. 그는 2026년 1월 21일 발표한 '2026년 유튜브의 비전'이라는 글에서 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 회사의 입장을 명확히 밝혔어요.\n모한 CEO는 AI가 창의적인 사람들에게 엄청난 기회가 될 것이라고 말하며, 포토샵이나 CGI 같은 도구에 비유했습니다. \"AI는 표현을 위한 도구이지, 인간을 대체하는 것이 아니다\"라고 강조했죠. 저도 이 말에 정말 공감하는데요, 결국 기술은 사람이 어떻게 쓰느냐에 따라 달라지는 것 아니겠어요?\n하지만 그는 AI 콘텐츠의 위험성도 동시에 지적했습니다. 진짜 영상과 AI 생성 영상을 구별하기 어려워지는 현실을 우려하며, \"커뮤니티 가이드라인을 위반하는 유해한 합성 미디어를 제거하고, 딥페이크를 식별하고 차단하는 도구를 크리에이터에게 제공할 것\"이라고 밝혔습니다. 이는 창의성을 존중하되, 윤리적 책임도 다하겠다는 유튜브의 강한 의지를 보여주는 대목이죠.\n특히 흥미로웠던 점은 그가 직접 'AI 슬롭 관리(Managing AI slop)'라는 섹션을 만들었다는 거예요. 모한 CEO는 유튜브의 목표가 '자유로운 표현의 장'인 동시에 '사람들이 시간을 보내면서 기분 좋게 느낄 수 있는 곳'이라고 말했습니다. 이를 위해 \"저품질 AI 콘텐츠의 확산을 줄이기 위해 스팸 및 클릭베이트 퇴치에 성공했던 기존 시스템을 적극적으로 활용하고 있다\"고 덧붙였죠.\n결론적으로 유튜브는 AI 생성 콘텐츠 자체를 반대하는 것이 아니라, 의미 없고 반복적이며 질 낮은 '슬롭'을 근절하겠다는 분명한 선을 그은 것입니다. 이는 유튜브 사용자 모두에게 좋은 소식일 뿐만 아니라, 앞으로 AI 콘텐츠를 제작하려는 크리에이터들에게도 명확한 가이드라인이 될 것이라고 생각합니다.\n⚠️ 경고: AI 콘텐츠 제작 시 유의할 점!\n유튜브는 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 투명성 의무를 강화하고 있습니다. 콘텐츠가 AI에 의해 변경되었거나 생성된 경우, 이를 명확히 밝히지 않으면 불이익을 받을 수 있습니다. 항상 유튜브의 커뮤니티 가이드라인을 준수해주세요.\n  고품질 AI 콘텐츠를 위한 크리에이터 생존 전략\n그렇다면 우리는 이 변화의 물결 속에서 어떻게 살아남고, 심지어 더 큰 기회를 만들 수 있을까요? 제 생각에는, 결국 '인간적인 터치'와 '가치 전달'에 달려 있다고 봅니다. 단순히 AI가 뽑아낸 결과물을 그대로 올리는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터의 역할이 더욱 중요해지는 시점이죠. 다음은 제가 제안하는 고품질 AI 콘텐츠 생존 전략입니다.\n1. 인간적인 독창성과 통찰력을 더하라\nAI는 데이터를 학습하고 패턴을 찾아내는 데는 탁월하지만, 고유한 경험, 감정, 그리고 깊이 있는 통찰력을 만들어내지는 못합니다. 여러분만의 시각, 분석, 혹은 개인적인 스토리를 AI 콘텐츠에 녹여내세요. 예를 들어, AI로 생성된 정보를 바탕으로 하더라도, 그 정보를 해석하고 독자에게 공감을 불러일으킬 만한 자신만의 서사를 추가하는 식이죠. 결국 사람의 마음을 움직이는 건 사람의 이야기 아니겠어요?\n2. AI 사용의 투명성을 확보하라\n유튜브는 2026년부터 AI 생성 콘텐츠에 대한 표시 의무를 강화하고 있습니다. 이제 단순히 'AI가 만들었나?' 하고 의심받는 것을 넘어, 크리에이터 스스로 AI 사용 여부를 명확히 밝히는 것이 신뢰를 구축하는 핵심이 될 것입니다. 시청자들은 정직함을 더 높이 평가할 거예요. 저라면, 영상 시작이나 설명란에 '이 영상은 AI 기술의 도움을 받아 제작되었습니다'라고 명확히 밝힐 것 같아요.\n3. '양'보다 '질'에 집중하라\n저품질 AI 슬롭이 넘쳐나는 시대에, 대량 생산은 더 이상 답이 아닙니다. 오히려 하나의 고품질 콘텐츠에 시간과 노력을 투자하는 것이 훨씬 효과적입니다. 좋은 프롬프트 엔지니어링, AI 결과물의 세심한 후반 작업, 그리고 인간의 검토와 편집은 필수적입니다. AI를 단순한 생산 도구로 생각하기보다, 여러분의 창의적인 비전을 실현하는 '협력자'로 활용해야 합니다.\n4. 커뮤니티와 적극적으로 소통하라\n진정성 있는 커뮤니케이션은 AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 영역입니다. 시청자의 댓글에 응답하고, 라이브 스트리밍을 통해 직접 소통하며, 설문조사 등을 통해 콘텐츠 기획에 참여시키는 것은 강력한 팬덤을 구축하는 데 도움이 됩니다. 결국 팬들은 AI가 아닌, 여러분이라는 인간 크리에이터와 소통하고 싶어 할 거예요.\n\n\n정리하자면, 2026년 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠의 홍수 속에서 '질'과 '인간적인 가치'를 더욱 중요하게 여기는 방향으로 진화하고 있습니다. 아래 표를 통해 'AI 슬롭'과 '고품질 AI 콘텐츠'의 차이를 한눈에 비교해보세요.\n항목\nAI 슬롭\n고품질 AI 콘텐츠\n\n\n\n\n주요 목표\n조회수, 광고 수익 극대화\n가치 제공, 시청자 만족, 브랜드 구축\n\n\n콘텐츠 특징\n반복적, 자극적, 의미 없음, 독창성 결여\n독창적, 통찰력, 고품질 편집, 인간적 감성\n\n\nAI 활용 방식\n생성 도구에 전적으로 의존, 무단 사용\n크리에이터의 비전을 돕는 보조 도구\n\n\n플랫폼 반응\n삭제 및 채널 제재\n긍정적 평가, 노출 기회 증가\n\n\n\n\n\n  핵심 요약\n1. 유튜브는 저품질 'AI 슬롭'과의 전쟁을 선포했습니다. 2026년 현재 수십억 뷰가 삭제되고 수많은 채널이 제재를 받았습니다.\n2. 닐 모한 CEO는 AI를 '표현의 도구'로 보며, 유해하거나 질 낮은 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 강력한 조치를 예고했습니다.\n3. 크리에이터는 인간적인 독창성, 투명성, 품질 중심 전략으로 변화에 대응해야 합니다.\n4. AI는 단순한 생산 도구가 아닌, '인간 크리에이터의 가치를 높이는 협력자'로서 활용되어야 합니다.\n*위 내용은 2026년 2월 12일 기준 유튜브 정책 및 시장 동향을 바탕으로 작성되었습니다.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 2026년에도 AI 콘텐츠를 유튜브에 올려도 괜찮을까요?\nA1: 네, 물론입니다. 유튜브는 AI 콘텐츠 자체를 금지하는 것이 아니라, 저품질의 'AI 슬롭'을 제재하는 것입니다. 중요한 것은 콘텐츠에 여러분의 독창적인 아이디어와 인간적인 가치를 담고, AI 사용 여부를 투명하게 공개하는 것입니다. AI는 강력한 창작 도구가 될 수 있습니다.\nQ2: 유튜브가 'AI 슬롭'을 판단하는 구체적인 기준은 무엇인가요?\nA2: 유튜브는 공식적으로 구체적인 기준을 명시하지는 않지만, 닐 모한 CEO의 발언을 통해 유추할 수 있습니다. 반복적이고 의미 없는 내용, 조회수나 광고 수익만을 위한 자극적인 콘텐츠, 커뮤니티 가이드라인을 위반하는 유해한 합성 미디어 등이 주요 대상입니다. 또한, AI 생성 여부를 숨기거나 오해를 불러일으키는 콘텐츠도 제재 대상이 될 수 있습니다.\nQ3: AI 콘텐츠 제작 시 크리에이터가 가장 중요하게 생각해야 할 것은 무엇인가요?\nA3: 단연 '품질'과 '진정성'입니다. AI는 보조 도구일 뿐, 콘텐츠의 기획, 스토리텔링, 편집 등 모든 과정에 크리에이터의 인간적인 노력과 통찰력이 들어가야 합니다. 시청자에게 실질적인 가치를 제공하고, 신뢰를 쌓는 것이 장기적인 성공의 열쇠입니다.\n2026년, 유튜브의 AI 콘텐츠 생태계는 새로운 전환점을 맞이하고 있습니다. '슬롭'을 피하고 고품질 콘텐츠로 인정받는 것은 더 이상 선택이 아닌 필수입니다. 여러분의 창의적인 열정과 인간적인 통찰력을 담아, 변화하는 유튜브에서 새로운 기회를 잡으시길 바랍니다! 감사합니다.",

        "contentSnippet": "AI 기술의 눈부신 발전 속에서 우리 인류는 어떤 능력을 키워야 할까요? AI가 대체할 수 없는 인간 고유의 5가지 핵심 특성과, AI와 상생하며 미래를 주도할 수 있는 새로운 마인드셋 전환에 대해 깊이 있게 탐구해 봅니다. 급변하는 시대에 흔들리지 않는 여러분만의 경쟁력을 찾는 여정에 함께해요!\n\n\n  AI 시대, 사라지지 않는 인간의 가치\n음, 여러분, 정말 놀랍지 않나요? 지금 이 순간에도 전 세계 수많은 직장에서 AI는 우리 일상의 많은 부분을 대신하고 있어요. 데이터 분석부터 문서 작성, 심지어는 복잡한 일정 관리까지, AI는 이 모든 것을 눈 깜짝할 사이에 처리해내죠. 그런데 여기서 정말 흥미로운 현상이 하나 나타나고 있더라고요. 바로 AI가 정해진 일을 더 빠르게 처리할수록, 역설적으로 인간의 고유한 가치가 더욱 빛을 발하고 있다는 점입니다.\n저 역시 처음엔 \"혹시 내 일자리도 AI에게 뺏기는 건 아닐까?\" 하는 불안감이 있었어요. 하지만 2026년 현재, 많은 기업과 조직들이 깨달은 건 AI 도입이 인간의 일자리를 없애는 것이 아니라, 어떤 능력을 갖춘 인간이 앞으로 더 필요한지를 명확하게 보여준다는 것이에요. 작년에 Workday가 전 세계 직원을 대상으로 진행한 설문조사를 보면, 무려 83%의 직원들이 AI가 오히려 인간 고유의 능력의 중요성을 높일 것이라고 동의했다고 해요. 세계경제포럼(WEF)도 2025년까지 65%의 일자리가 강력한 소프트 스킬을 요구하게 될 것이라고 예측했고요.\n그렇다면 우리 인간만이 가진, AI가 절대 대체할 수 없는 능력은 과연 무엇일까요? 오늘은 이 다섯 가지 핵심 특성에 대해 좀 더 깊이 있게 이야기해보려 합니다.\n❤️ 1. 공감 능력과 감정 지능\nAI는 감정을 진정으로 이해할 수 있을까요?\nAI가 할 수 있는 것, 참 많죠. 고객의 감정을 '감지'하고, 분노의 신호를 인식해서 특정 감정 상태를 분류하는 건 이제 식은 죽 먹기예요. 하지만 제가 겪어본 바로는, AI가 아무리 정교해져도 진정으로 타인의 감정을 이해하고 공감하는 일은… 글쎄요, 불가능에 가깝다고 생각합니다.\n챗봇이 \"안타깝습니다\"라는 문구를 보낸다고 해도, 우리는 본능적으로 그게 진정한 감정이 아니라는 걸 알죠. 기계는 우리처럼 희로애락을 느낄 수 없으니까요. 반면, 잘 훈련된 리더나 뛰어난 영업사원, 그리고 마음을 치유하는 상담가들은 상대방의 미묘한 표정 변화, 목소리 톤, 숨겨진 의미까지 포착해서 그 순간에 가장 적절한 반응을 보입니다. 바로 이게 진짜 '공감' 아닐까요?\n왜 AI 시대에 공감 능력이 더 중요해질까요?\nWEF의 2025년 보고서에 따르면, 직장인 82%가 AI 시대일수록 오히려 더 인간적인 연결을 갈망하고 있다고 해요. 특히 HR, 리더십, 고객 서비스, 교육, 의료 분야에서는 이런 수요가 정말 폭발적이죠.\n한번 이런 상황을 상상해볼까요? 어려운 구매 결정을 앞둔 고객이 있어요. AI 기반 챗봇은 아주 논리적이고 효율적인 답변을 척척 내놓습니다. 하지만 경험 많은 인간 영업 담당자는 고객의 불안감을 감지하고, \"아, 많이 망설여지시죠? 충분히 이해합니다\"라며 그 감정을 먼저 인정해준 다음 차근차근 설득하죠. 결과는요? AI 챗봇은 거래 성사율이 낮은 반면, 인간 영업사원의 성약률은 훨씬 높다는 통계가 있습니다. AI 시대의 경쟁력은 더 이상 데이터를 얼마나 빠르게 처리하는가가 아니에요. 고객이나 팀원의 감정을 얼마나 잘 읽고, 그에 맞춰 반응할 수 있는가가 핵심이 될 거라고 저는 확신합니다.\n\n\n\n  팁: 일상생활에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학 작품이나 영화를 통해 다양한 감정을 간접 경험하는 것도 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n  2. 비판적 사고와 판단력\nAI는 데이터의 한계를 모릅니다\nAI는 정말 대량의 데이터를 분석해서 패턴을 찾고, 그럴듯한 결론을 제시하는 데는 탁월해요. 이건 정말 인정할 수밖에 없죠. 그런데 AI가 절대 할 수 없는 게 있습니다. 바로 그 데이터가 정말 맞는지 의심하고, 혹시 숨겨진 편향은 없는지 감지하고, 복잡한 상황에 맞는 최종 판단을 내리는 일입니다.\nAI 시스템이 어떤 권장안을 제시했다고 가정해봅시다. AI는 학습한 데이터 안에서는 이 권장안이 논리적으로 '가장 최적'이라고 자신할 거예요. 하지만 우리 인간은 다르죠. 비판적 사고를 가진 사람은 이렇게 질문을 던질 겁니다. \"이 데이터가 최신 정보인가?\", \"여기에 특정 집단에 불리한 편향은 숨겨져 있지 않을까?\", \"이 권장안이 다른 예상치 못한 변수들까지 고려했을까?\", \"과연 실제 현장에서도 통할까?\" 바로 이런 질문을 던지는 것이 진정한 비판적 사고의 시작점이라고 생각합니다.\nAI 시대에 비판적 사고가 필수인 이유\nMcKinsey 연구에 따르면, 2026년에는 AI 윤리 문제가 정말 폭발적으로 증가할 것으로 예상된다고 합니다. 자동화된 시스템이 내린 결정이 자칫하면 차별로 이어지거나, 개인정보 보호에 위협이 될 수도 있잖아요. 이런 문제들을 감시하고, 올바른 방향으로 이끌어갈 인간의 역할이 정말 필수적이라는 거죠.\n현재 AI가 데이터 분석의 절반이 넘는 51%를 담당하고 있다고 해요. 하지만 아무리 AI가 분석을 잘해도, 결국 누군가는 그 분석 결과를 검토해야 합니다. \"이게 정말 맞는가?\"라고 근본적인 질문을 던지고, 상황에 맞춰 최선의 판단을 내리는 것. 그것은 여전히 우리 인간만이 할 수 있는 귀한 능력이라고 확신합니다.\n✨ 3. 창의성과 혁신\nAI는 조합할 뿐, 창조는 못 합니다\nGenerative AI가 그림을 그리고, 음악을 작곡하고, 심지어 시나 소설 같은 텍스트까지 써내는 모습을 보면 정말 대단하다는 생각이 들어요. 기존 패턴을 조합해서 새로운 결과물을 만들어내는 데는 능수능란하죠. 하지만 이런 AI의 결과물을 '창의성'이라고 부르기에는 저는 좀 위험하다고 봐요. 왜냐하면 AI의 모든 출력은 결국 학습 데이터의 통계적 최적화에 불과하거든요.\n진정한 창의성은 완전히 다른 이야기입니다. 예를 들어, 스티브 잡스가 음악 산업을 완전히 뒤집어 놓은 사례를 생각해봅시다. 그는 기존 음악 구조의 패턴을 단순히 조합한 것이 아니에요. 그는 \"음악은 어떻게 소비되어야 하는가?\"라는 정말 근본적인 질문을 던졌고, 그 질문에 대한 답으로 아이팟과 아이튠즈라는 새로운 패러다임을 창조했습니다. 기존의 규칙을 깨고, 세상을 변화시키는 이런 능력이 바로 진정한 창의성이죠.\n왜 2026년, 창의력이 더욱 중요할까요?\n세계경제포럼은 창의성이 2026년 AI 시대의 혁신을 정의할 핵심 요소라고 예측했습니다. 특히 R&D, 전략 기획, 신사업 개발 분야에서는 창의력 있는 인간 리더의 수요가 앞으로도 계속 증가할 것으로 보고 있어요.\n여기 재미있는 통계가 하나 있습니다. AI가 생성한 콘텐츠가 많아질수록, 역설적으로 '인간이 직접 만든 것'의 가치가 더 높아지고 있다는 사실이에요. 예술 시장, 패션 산업, 게임 개발 등 다양한 분야에서 모두 비슷한 현상을 보여주고 있죠. AI가 할 수 있는 것이 점점 더 많아질수록, 인간만이 만들 수 있는 진정한 창의성의 가치는 더욱 빛을 발할 거라고 저는 확신해요.\n\n\n ‍♀️ 4. 적응력과 회복력\nAI는 프로그래밍된 틀 밖으로 나갈 수 없습니다\nAI는 주어진 범위 내에서 정말 효율적으로 작동하고, 예상된 문제는 기가 막히게 잘 해결합니다. 그런데 말이죠, 예상하지 못한 상황에 맞닥뜨렸을 때, 빠르게 적응하고 완전히 새로운 방식으로 생각하는 일은 AI에게는 정말 어려운 일이에요.\n2020년 COVID-19 팬데믹을 한 번 떠올려볼까요? 세상이 갑자기, 정말 하루아침에 변했어요. 직장은 원격근무로 전환됐고, 고객의 수요는 급변했죠. 이 와중에 수많은 AI 시스템들은 학습 데이터에 없는 전례 없는 상황에 직면하며 혼란스러워했습니다. 하지만 우리 인간들은 어땠나요? 놀랍도록 빠르게 적응했습니다! 새로운 업무 방식을 배웠고, 새로운 도구를 익혔으며, 심지어 완전히 새로운 기회를 찾아 커리어를 전환한 사람들도 많았죠. 이게 바로 인간의 진정한 강점, 적응력과 회복력입니다.\n\"무엇을 아는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우는가\"가 중요한 시대\n변화의 속도는 정말이지 점점 더 빨라지고 있습니다. 기술 산업의 반감기(기술이 절반으로 쓸모없어지는 시간)는 지속적으로 단축되고 있고요. 이런 급변하는 환경에서는 솔직히, \"지금 무엇을 알고 있는가\"보다 \"얼마나 빠르게 배우고 새로운 것에 적응할 수 있는가\"가 훨씬, 정말 훨씬 더 중요하다고 저는 생각해요.\nWEF 연구에 따르면, 관리자급 직원의 65%가 적응력을 직원 유지의 핵심 요소로 평가했다고 합니다. AI는 기존 업무를 더 효율적으로 처리하도록 돕지만, 완전히 새로운 업무 영역으로 뛰어들 수는 없어요. 새로운 길을 개척하고, 불확실성 속에서 빛을 찾는 것은 여전히 우리 인간의 영역인 거죠.\n  5. 윤리적 판단과 신뢰 구축\nAI는 알고리즘만 따를 뿐입니다\nAI는 주어진 규칙을 정확하게 따르고, 프로그래밍된 원칙에 따라 아주 일관되게 행동합니다. 이건 정말 강점이죠. 하지만 도덕적 회색지대에서 섬세한 판단을 내리고, 복잡한 문화적 맥락을 이해하며, 무엇보다 사람과의 '신뢰'를 구축하는 일은 AI에게는 불가능에 가깝다고 저는 단언할 수 있습니다.\n윤리적 판단의 아주 중요한 예를 들어볼까요? 의료 현장에서 신약을 승인할지 말지 결정해야 하는 상황이 왔다고 칩시다. AI는 모든 임상시험 데이터를 분석해서 \"이 약은 80% 효과가 있고, 20%의 부작용이 있습니다\"라고 아주 명확한 결론을 내릴 수 있습니다. 그런데 우리 인간은 여기서 멈추지 않죠. 우리는 이렇게 질문할 겁니다. \"그 20%의 부작용은 생명에 치명적인가?\", \"이 약이 도움이 되는 집단은 누구이며, 고가의 약값이 소외 계층을 배제하지는 않을까?\", \"장기적인 부작용까지 충분히 고려되었는가?\" 이런 질문들에 답하려면 의학적 지식뿐만 아니라 윤리, 사회학, 인문학적 깊은 이해가 필요해요. AI는 여기서 한계를 드러낼 수밖에 없죠.\n신뢰가 곧 자산인 시대, 인간의 윤리적 판단이 필수입니다\n현재 AI가 모든 데이터 분석의 51%를 담당하고 있다는 것은, 바꿔 말하면 51%의 의사결정이 이미 자동화되었다는 뜻입니다. 하지만 Workday 연구에 따르면, 직장에서 가장 중요하게 여기는 인간적 능력 중 하나가 바로 윤리적 의사결정 능력이라고 합니다.\n신뢰는 어떤 조직이든 가장 기본적인, 그리고 가장 소중한 자산이죠. AI가 의사결정을 돕는 것은 맞지만, 최종 책임과 그에 따른 신뢰는 여전히 인간이 져야 합니다. 고객들은 알고리즘을 맹목적으로 신뢰하는 것이 아니라, 그 알고리즘을 설계하고 감시하는 우리 인간을 신뢰하니까요. 또한 전 세계 기업들이 직면한 'AI 윤리' 이슈는 차별 문제, 개인정보 보호, 환경 영향, 노동 문제 등 점점 더 복잡해지고 있어요. 이 모든 영역에서 우리 인간의 윤리적 판단력은 필수불가결한 요소라고 할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n  핵심 인사이트: AI 시대, 일자리는 '변한다'는 것을 기억하세요!\n뉴욕 타임스의 칼럼니스트 토마스 프리드먼(Thomas Friedman)은 이런 말을 남겼죠:\n\"AI가 너를 대체하지는 않겠지. 하지만 AI를 잘 쓰는 누군가가 너를 대체할 수도 있다.\"\n이 말은 정말 많은 의미를 담고 있어요. 제 생각에는 크게 두 가지로 해석할 수 있습니다.\n첫째, AI 기술 자체는 중립적이라는 거예요. AI가 어떻게 쓰이는지는 전적으로 우리 인간의 결정에 달려있다는 거죠.\n둘째, 앞으로의 경쟁력은 단순히 기술 하나만으로는 안 되고, 기술 + 인간 능력의 스마트한 조합에서 나온다는 점입니다. 기술만 뛰어나도 안 되고, 인간 능력만 뛰어나도 안 되는, 그런 시대가 온 거죠.\n ️ 2026년의 현실: 지금 당장 이 능력들을 키워야 하는 이유\n현재 많은 기업과 조직에서는 직원을 채용하거나 임금을 결정할 때, 기술 능력과 함께 인간 능력의 균형을 정말 중요하게 보고 있어요. 한 번 생각해볼까요?\n능력 기준\nA 직원\nB 직원\n\n\n\n\n기술 능력\n매우 높음\n평균 수준\n\n\n인간 고유 능력 (공감, 리더십, 적응력 등)\n평균 이하\n매우 뛰어남\n\n\n회사의 선택은?\n점점 더 B 직원을 선호하는 추세!\n\n\n\n왜냐고요? 기술은 정말 빠르게 변하지만, 우리 인간의 기본 능력, 그러니까 공감 능력, 비판적 판단력, 그리고 창의력 같은 것들은 시간이 지나도 그 가치를 잃지 않기 때문입니다. 오히려 그 가치는 더욱 커지고 있어요.\n당신이 지금 바로 해야 할 일들\n공감 능력을 키우세요: 일상에서 다른 사람의 관점에서 생각해보고, 그들의 감정에 귀 기울이는 연습을 해보세요. 문학을 읽고, 영화를 보고, 다양한 배경의 사람들과 대화하며 시야를 넓히는 것도 좋습니다.\n의문을 던지는 습관을 가지세요: 주어진 정보를 무조건 받아들이기보다는 \"왜?\", \"이게 정말 최선일까?\", \"다른 관점은 없을까?\"와 같은 질문을 끊임없이 던지는 습관을 길러보세요.\n창의력을 개발하세요: 때로는 기존의 규칙을 깨어보고, 새로운 조합을 시도해보세요. 실패를 두려워하지 않는 용기가 중요합니다.\n변화를 즐기세요: 새로운 기술을 배우는 데 주저하지 말고, 새로운 업계를 탐험하고, 낯선 분야의 사람들과 네트워킹하며 끊임없이 성장하는 자신을 발견해 보세요.\n윤리 감각을 기르세요: 어떤 의사결정을 할 때든 \"이것이 과연 옳은가?\"라는 질문을 항상 던지고, 단기적인 이익보다는 장기적인 영향까지 깊이 생각하는 습관을 들이세요.\n  핵심 요약\nAI는 감정을 이해하고 공감할 수 없으므로, 인간적인 연결이 더욱 중요해집니다.\nAI는 데이터만 처리할 뿐, 비판적 사고와 상황에 맞는 판단은 인간의 몫입니다.\nAI는 기존 패턴을 조합하지만, 완전히 새로운 패러다임 창조는 인간의 창의력에 달려있습니다.\n급변하는 시대에 AI는 예측된 문제만 해결, 인간의 적응력과 회복력이 더욱 빛을 발합니다.\nAI는 훌륭한 도구이지만, 결국 그 가치를 극대화하는 것은 우리 인간의 고유한 능력임을 잊지 마세요.\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\nA1: 제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\nQ2: 소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\nA2: 네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\nQ3: AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\nA3: 창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\n{\"@context\":\"https://schema.org\",\"@type\":\"FAQPage\",\"mainEntity\":[{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI가 제 일자리를 완전히 대체할 수도 있지 않을까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"제 생각에는 AI가 일자리를 완전히 없애기보다는, 그 성격과 필요한 역량을 변화시킬 것이라고 보는 게 더 정확합니다. 단순 반복 업무는 AI가 담당하고, 인간은 공감, 창의성, 비판적 사고 등 인간 고유의 역량을 활용하는 역할에 집중하게 될 거예요. 중요한 건 AI를 효과적으로 활용하고, AI가 대체할 수 없는 나만의 강점을 키우는 것입니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"소프트 스킬이 정말 기술 능력보다 중요해지는 건가요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"네, 세계경제포럼(WEF) 같은 기관들도 2025년까지 많은 일자리에서 강력한 소프트 스킬의 중요성이 증대될 것이라고 예측하고 있습니다. 기술 능력은 물론 중요하지만, 빠르게 변하는 기술 환경 속에서 인간적인 연결, 윤리적 판단, 그리고 변화에 대한 적응력 같은 소프트 스킬은 어떤 기술보다도 더 오래 지속될 핵심 경쟁력이 될 거예요. 두 가지 모두 균형 있게 발전시키는 것이 중요합니다.\"}},{\"@type\":\"Question\",\"name\":\"AI 시대에 창의력을 키우려면 어떻게 해야 할까요?\",\"acceptedAnswer\":{\"@type\":\"Answer\",\"text\":\"창의력은 단순히 새로운 아이디어를 내는 것을 넘어, 기존의 사고방식을 깨고 새로운 관점에서 문제를 바라보는 능력입니다. 다양한 분야의 책을 읽고, 예술 작품을 감상하고, 익숙하지 않은 사람들과 교류하며 시야를 넓히는 것이 좋습니다. 또한, AI를 도구 삼아 아이디어를 실험하고 빠르게 프로토타입을 만들어보는 연습도 큰 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 틀에 갇히지 않고 끊임없이 질문하고 시도하는 태도가 중요해요.\"}}]} \n  결론: AI와 인간, 경쟁이 아닌 협력의 미래!\nAI 기술의 발전은 이제 피할 수 없는, 우리 삶의 자연스러운 일부가 되었죠. 하지만 중요한 건, 이 기술이 결코 우리 인간을 완전히 대체하는 것이 아니라는 점입니다. 오히려 제가 오늘 말씀드린 것처럼 AI는 우리 인간만이 가진 고유한 가치를 더욱 선명하게 드러내고, 그 중요성을 부각시키는 강력한 도구가 될 거예요.\nWorkday의 글로벌 설문 결과도 이를 명확하게 보여줍니다. 83%의 직원들이 AI가 인간 고유의 능력을 더욱 중요하게 만들 것이라고 굳게 믿고 있었으니까요. 이제 우리는 질문을 바꿔야 할 때가 왔다고 생각합니다.\n\"AI가 나를 대체할까?\"\n라는 막연한 불안감 대신,\n\"나는 AI와 함께 무엇을 만들 수 있을까?\"\n라고 긍정적이고 미래지향적인 질문을 던져보는 거죠.\n여러분이 공감할 수 있고, 비판적으로 생각할 수 있으며, 새로운 것을 상상하고, 변화에 빠르게 적응할 수 있고, 마지막으로 옳은 선택을 할 수 있다면—이 다섯 가지 능력이 바로 여러분의 미래를 단단하게 보장해 줄 거라 저는 확신합니다.\n기억하세요. AI 시대의 진정한 경쟁력은 단순한 기술 지식이 아닙니다. 바로 인간다움, 그 자체에 있습니다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "미국 출장 중에 어떤 미국 VC가 혹시 스트롱이 이런 회사에 투자 관심이 있는지 물어봤는데, 이 분은 우리가 어떤 전략으로, 어떤 시장에, 어떤 조건으로 투자하는지 전혀 모르기 때문에 이런 딜을 공유해 준 것 같다. 희토류 관련 사업을 하는 미국 회사인데 현재 약 3조 원 밸류로 여러 VC와 이야기를 하고 있었다. 우리가 투자하기엔 너무나 비싼 회사였고, 분야도 좀 그렇고, 시장도 한국이 아니라서 듣자마자 바로 패스이긴 했는데, 그냥 희토류 시장 자체가 좀 궁금해서 여러 가지 질문을 했다.\n15분 정도의 대화를 통해서 알게 된 사실은 전 세계 희토류 시장의 90%가 중국에 있어서 우리가 이야기하던 이 3조 원 밸류의 회사는 남은 10%의 시장에서 사업을 하고 있다는 점이다. 그리고 더 충격적인 사실은 현재 실제 매출은 전혀 없고, 예약된 매출만 있다는 것이었다. 예약된 매출이란 중국과 미국의 마찰 때문에 미국 정부가 희토류 확보를 위해서 이 회사를 엄청나게 밀어주고 있어서 미국 정부로부터 부킹?된 매출이다. 나는 이 사업이 과연 잘 될지, 그리고 매출 0원인 회사의 기업가치가 3조 원이라는 게 말이 되는지, 도대체 이 회사에 이미 커밋한 투자자들은 누구이고 이들은 무슨 생각을 하는지 진짜 궁금하긴 했다.\n미래에 예약된(=부킹된) 매출이 발생하는 영역에서 사업하는 우리 투자사들도 있는데, 이 부킹이 된 매출 중 실제 매출로 전환되는 금액은 대부분 0이거나 매우 작다. 아마도 위에서 이야기한 희토류 회사는 미국 정부로부터 부킹된 매출이라서 전환율은 조금 더 높을 것 같지만, 현재 미국 정부가 하는 걸 보면 이 또한 불확실성 투성이다.\n이런 사업을 우리는 정치적인 사업(political business)이라고 한다. 상업적인 사업(commercial business)과는 완전히 다른 성격의 사업이고, 조금 더 쉽게 풀어 설명하면 제대로 된 사업이 아니라는 말이다. 중국과의 마찰 때문에 미국 정부가 밀어주는 분야라서 갑자기 떴고, 주목받는 사업이라서 이런 회사에 3조 원 밸류에이션에 돈을 쏘는 투자자도 있는 것 같은데, 갑자기 미중 관계가 좋아지거나, 또는 미국 정부의 희토류에 대한 기조가 바뀐다면 하루 만에 망할 수도 있는 그런 사업이다.\n한국에서도 가끔 이런 사업을 하는 창업가들을 만난다. 자생할 수 있는 기술, 제품, 서비스는 없고 정부의 기조 때문에 운 좋게 큰 계약을 하거나 큰 매출을 만드는 정치적인 사업이 실은 한국에도 꽤 많다. 워낙 한국 정부가 과감한 드라이브를 많이 걸고, 특정 분야가 뜬다고 하면 이 분야에 막대한 투자를 하면서 온갖 정부 과제와 보조금이 갑자기 생기기 때문이다.\n창업자나 투자자도 본인들이 하는 사업과 투자 검토하는 사업이 정치적인 사업인지 시장의 논리로 돌아가는 상업적인 사업인지 잘 구분해야 한다. 관건은 이 사업에서 정치적인 부분이 없어져도 자생할 수 있는 제품, 매출, 그리고 고객을 보유하고 있는 사업인지 여부다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 미국에 한 10일 정도 갔다 왔다. 짧은 일정이었지만, 꽤 많은 업계 분과 투자자들을 만나서 요새 미국 tech 시장에서 어떤 일들이 일어나고 있고, 우리보다 훨씬 큰 투자자들은 어떤 생각을 하고 있고, 어떤 딜들을 보고 있고, 어떤 고민을 하고 있는지 들을 수 있었고, 동시에 많이 배울 수 있었다. 내가 이 글에서는 우리 같은 VC는 창업가에게 엄청 많이 배운다고 했는데, 이건 배움의 절반에 대해서만 이야기한 것 같다. 나머지 절반은 우리가 투자할 수 있게 소중한 자금을 제공해 주는 우리의 LP들에게 배우는 것 같다.\n아무래도 미국 벤처투자자들과 가장 많이 이야기했던 주제는 올해 예정된 스페이스엑스, 오픈AI, 그리고 앤쓰로픽의 IPO였는데 이 세 회사가 원하는 기업가치 총액은 거의 $3.5 trillion이다. 스페이스엑스가 공개적으로 이야기하는 기업가치가 $1.5T인데 이는 한국 GDP의 4분의 3이다. 정말 어마어마한 숫자이고 나도 이 일을 하면서 꽤 큰 금액에 대해 이야기하고 billion이라는 단어도 가끔 말하지만, trillion은 입에 담기조차 부담스러운 단위이다.\n요새 이 시장에선 billion과 trillion이라는 단위가 너무 남발되고 있고, 내가 느끼는 걸 영어로 표현해 보면 “$100 billion is the new $100 million(이제 1,000억 달러가 과거의 1억 달러다.)”이다. 솔직히 몇 년 전만 해도 미국의 대형 VC를 제외하곤 대부분의 VC가 $10B 밸류에 투자유치를 하는 회사들을 상당히 부담스러워했다. 일단 한화로 15조 원이라는 기업 가치 자체가 너무 컸고, 이 밸류에 투자하면 정말로 돈을 벌 수 있을지에 대한 의구심이 앞섰던 것 같다. 그리고 너무 비싸다는 불평을 계속하면서 아주 꼼꼼하고 깐깐하게 실사하고, 여러 번 고민했던, 그런 시절이 있었다.\n몇 년 전에는 전 세계에서 가장 비싼 유니콘 회사가 Stripe과 ByteDance였는데 가장 고점을 쳤을 때가 아마도 $100 B 정도였던 것 같다. 이 시기에 두 회사가 시장에서 펀드레이징을 돌 때, 회사를 소개해 주는 기존 주주들도 약간 민망해하면서 딜을 공유했던 기억이 난다. 왜냐하면 본인들의 포트폴리오지만, 본인들이 생각해도 말도 안 되게 비싼 것 같고 $100 B이라는 금액 자체가 너무나 큰돈이라서 감이 잘 안 잡혔던 것 같다. 그런데 요새는 상황이 완전히 반대다. $100B은 마치 과거의 $100M 같고 – 실은 $100M도 우리같이 작은 투자자에겐 너무나 큰 돈이다 – 스페이스엑스의 구주를 $1T에 구매하고 싶다는 투자자들도 충분히 있다는 소문은 나에게는 꽤 충격적인 시장의 현실이 아닐 수 없다. 그 누구도 오픈AI와 앤쓰로픽이 $1T이라는 숫자를 이야기할 때 비싸다는 이야기를 안 하고, 그 비싼 가격에 사면 누군가는 더 비싸게 살 사람이 있다는 생각으로만 – 이건 전형적인 바보들의 이론이다 – 이런 비싼 딜을 바라보고 있다. 마치 요샌 그냥 이 정도 가격을 내야 한다는 생각이 기본적으로 깔린 것 같다.\n지금 우리 주위에서 일어나는 이런 현상을 어떻게 설명해야 할까? 절대 금액의 의미 자체가 희석되어 숫자의 인플레이션이 일어나고 있는 것 같다. 숫자의 인플레이션이 아니라면 정말로 이 세상에 몇 년 전 대비 돈이 그렇게 많아졌을까? 종이 상으로는 많아졌을 수도 있지만, 정말로 $100B이라는 돈을 마치 $100M 같이 취급할 정도로? “이걸 더 높은 가격에 사는 다른 바보가 있다면, 현재의 가격이 맞는지는 중요하지 않다” 전략은 거품 시장에서 우리가 과거에도 몇 번 봤던 현상인데, 더 이상 더 높은 가격에 사는 바보들이 없어진다면 – 그리고 생각보다 빨리 없어질 수도 있다 – 이야기의 결말은 해피 엔딩이 아닐 것이다. 특히나 금액이 이렇게 커진 상황에서 시장이 무너지면 정말 전세계적인 재앙이 될 것이다.\n물론, 미국이라는 나라는 한국보다 GDP가 15배나 높은, 비교할 수 없을 정도의 강대국이다. 그래도 미국의 로켓 회사 하나, 그리고 두 개의 AI 회사의 총 기업가치가 전세계에서 13번째로 잘사는 나라인 대한민국 GDP의 거의 두 배라는 건 잘 모르겠다. 내가 걱정하는 이 재앙이 제발 오지 않았으면.",

'투자의 힘을 모두에게.' 국내에서 증명한 방식을 글로벌로 확장하고, 소수의 전유물이었던 자산관리를 누구나 접근할 수 있는 영역으로 만들겠다는 비전이었죠. 매출 규모를 키우는 것보다 매출의 질을 높이는 것, 투자라는 영역 전체를 토스증권의 무대로 만들겠다는 포부가 담겨 있었습니다.\n\n”뱅킹의 본질로 돌아가다”\n— 토스뱅크 리더 이은미 \n은미 님은 토스뱅크가 이룬 성과를 나열하기에 앞서 \"기술이 이렇게 발전했는데도, 왜 뱅킹은 여전히 어렵고 불편할까?\"라는 질문을 던졌습니다. 이 질문을 통해 토스뱅크가 추구해온 뱅킹의 본질이 무엇인지 다시 돌아보게 된다고 했습니다.\n\n이에 대해 은미 님이 제안하는 방향은 분명했습니다. 뱅킹의 본질은 사람들에게 금융 자원을 온전히 다룰 힘을 주는 것. 개인이든 사업자든, 현금이든 디지털 화폐든, 형태와 관계없이 고객이 더 나은 선택을 할 수 있도록 돕는 일이라는 것이죠. 그래서 앞으로 토스뱅크는 이 본질을 더 정확하고 완전하게 구현하는 데 집중한다고 했습니다. 금융을 향한 모든 질문이 사라질 때까지요.\n\n”Tax를 넘어 Income으로”\n— 토스인컴 리더 최성희 \n2025년 토스인컴은 '숨은 환급액 찾기'를 중심으로 빠르게 성장했습니다. 성희 님은 유입 고객 수, 신고 전환율, 유저당 결제액이라는 세 가지 핵심 지표를 개선해온 과정을 짚었어요. 서비스 성장의 레버가 되는 지표에 집중했던 것이, 더 많은 유저에게 더 많은 환급액을 돌려주는 결과로 이어졌다는 설명이었습니다.\n이어서 토스인컴은 앞으로 ‘세금’을 넘어 ‘소득 전체’를 다루는 서비스로 확장하겠다는 비전을 제시했어요. 개인의 세금은 물론, 사업자의 매출과 비용까지 아우르며 소득이 발생하는 순간부터 세금으로 이어지는 전 과정을 더 쉽고 단순하게 만들겠다는 목표입니다. 토스인컴이 소득이 있는 모두에게 꼭 필요한 서비스가 될 때까지요.\n\n“We make the way”\n— 토스플레이스 리더 최재호\n토스플레이스는 빠르게 성장하고 있습니다. 어느덧 전국 가맹점은 28만 개를 넘어섰고* 오프라인 인프라 중에서도 손꼽히는 속도를 만들었죠. 재호 님은 이 성장은 가맹점 운영 전체의 과정을 이해하려고 한 덕분이라고 했습니다. 단순히 단말기를 빠르게 보급하는 데서 멈추지 않고, 가맹점의 하루를 처음부터 끝까지 세부적으로 설계한 선택이 쌓인 결과라는 이야기였습니다.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}* 2026년 2월 기준\n재호 님은 앞으로 토스플레이스가 POS*를 하나의 기능이 아니라, 가맹점 운영을 떠받치는 플랫폼으로 만들 것이라고 강조했어요. 결제부터 재고, 직원, 매출 데이터까지 한 흐름으로 연결하고, 현장의 기준을 바꾸겠다는 거죠. 재호 님은 이를 두고 \"길이 없으면, 우리가 만든다\"고 표현했어요. 앞으로도 토스플레이스만의 유니크한 길을 만들어 갈 것이라는 자신감 넘치는 메시지였습니다.\n* 매장 주문·결제·매출 관리 서비스\n\n“One & Only”\n— 토스페이먼츠 리더 임한욱\n2025년 토스페이먼츠는 분명한 변화를 만들었습니다. 오랜 시간 이어졌던 구조를 정리하고, 사업의 체질을 하나씩 바꿔나갔죠. 한욱 님은 이 변화가 ‘Focus on Impact’ 라는 토스의 핵심 가치에 집중하고 반복해온 덕분이라고 강조했습니다.\n토스페이먼츠는 많은 것을 동시에 진행하려 하지 않았습니다. 가맹점 경험을 중심에 두고, 결제의 흐름을 단순하게 만들며, 시스템을 하나의 방식으로 묶어가는 선택을 이어왔죠. 한욱 님은 이를 'One & Only 전략'이라고 설명했습니다. 토스페이먼츠의 Way to Win은 남들과 비슷해지기보다 하나의 방향을 끝까지 밀고 나간 것에 있었습니다.\n\n“성공의 시간축을 '될 때까지'로 세팅한다”\n— 토스인슈어런스 리더 조병익\n병익 님이 정의하는 보험의 본질은 명확합니다. 위험이 닥치기 전에 최소한의 선택지는 남겨두는 것. 그래서 토스인슈어런스는 고객이 선택한 선택지가 최선의 선택이 될 수 있도록 설계사를 빠르게 늘리면서도, 퀄리티를 잃지 않는 데 집중하고 있습니다.\n병익 님은 보험을 '시간의 게임'이라고 표현했습니다. 국내 보험 시장은 연간 200조 원이 넘는 규모의 거대한 시장*이지만, 새로운 시도가 쉽지 않고 변화의 속도도 느린 곳입니다. 그렇기 때문에 토스인슈어런스는 단기 성과보다, 얼마나 오래 버티며 제대로 해낼 수 있는지를 먼저 고민한다고 말했습니다. 병익 님은 이를 두고 '성공의 시간축을 될 때까지로 설정하면 되는 일'이라고 표현했는데요. 보험이 꼭 필요한 순간에 외면 받는 고객이 없도록 토스인슈어런스가 계속 나아가겠다는 약속이었습니다.\n* 자료: 보험연구원\n\n”Back to Basics, 만족을 향한 집요함”\n— 토스CX 리더 강진석 \n2025년 토스CX는 지금의 방식으로도 상담을 계속 이어갈 수 있을지, 이 구조가 앞으로도 지속 가능할지에 대한 과제를 안고 있었습니다. 진석 님은 이를 '생존의 문제'라고 표현했죠. 이 과제는 토스CX가 해온 모든 가정을 다시 점검하게 만들었습니다. 그 결과, 더 많은 것을 시도하기보다 무엇이 정말 중요한지부터 다시 정의하는 선택을 했다고 말했습니다.\n\"We're not going to do anything fancy.\" 진석 님은 NBA를 대표하는 전설적인 감독 그렉 포포비치 감독의 말을 인용했습니다. 화려한 전략 대신 탄탄한 기본기를 강조한 철학이죠. 이 말과 함께 토스CX가 커뮤니티 전체의 성장을 함께 떠받치는 파트너가 되겠다고 했습니다. 상담의 품질과 속도, 비용의 균형을 지키며 고객 만족을 향해 나아가는 토스CX의 기본을 끝까지 지켜내겠다는 선언이었습니다.\n\n2026년 상반기 얼라인먼트 위크에서는 Way to Win이라는 슬로건 아래 지난 학기의 성과와 실패를 공유하고, 앞으로의 방향을 함께 확인하며 원팀으로 뭉칠 수 있었습니다. \n토스팀의 실험과 도전은 지금 이 순간에도 이어지고 있습니다. 그리고 이 과정에서 쌓이는 이야기들은 다음 얼라인먼트 위크에서 다시 펼쳐질 겁니다. 언제나 그랬듯이요.\n.css-nv7vyi{margin:24px 0 8px;padding:16px 40px 32px;border-radius:16px;background-color:var(--adaptiveGrey100);}.css-123co55{font-size:19px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;margin:24px 0 0;font-weight:400;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);background-color:transparent;}\n얼라인먼트 위크는 반년마다 열리는 토스 커뮤니티의 가장 큰 이벤트입니다. 일주일간 이어지는 이 행사에서는 전 계열사 팀원들이 함께 지난 6개월을 돌아보고, 다가올 여정의 방향을 함께 나눕니다.\n\n얼라인먼트 위크에서는 성과뿐만 아니라 실패와 시행착오, 그 과정에서 얻은 인사이트까지 솔직하게 공유하는 자리를 가져요. 이 과정을 통해 각자의 영역에서 서로 다른 문제를 풀고 있지만, 결국에는 모두가 하나의 목표를 향하고 있다는 사실을 다시금 확인하죠.\n\n토스팀의 얼라인먼트 위크에 대해 더 잘 알고 싶다면 .css-iynyr0{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}이 아티클을 통해 자세히 확인할 수 있어요!\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 윤동해 Photo 이욱영",
