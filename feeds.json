This release adds support for Azure universal packages as a binary caching provider and other minor improvements.\nCppCon Talk on Managing C++ Dependencies\nI also gave a talk at CppCon about 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them. Here is a video recording of the talk:\n\nIn particular, I talked about several vcpkg features that can help:\nSupporting build from source as a fallback without sacrificing the build-time savings of binary dependency acquisition.\nUpgrading dependencies as a set using baselines, rather than managing them individually, to avoid version conflicts / diamond problems.\nHow to continue working in an offline build environment using asset caching.\nGetting any open-source libraries installed and working with your project with minimal effort, while also automatically resolving transitive dependencies.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,490 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n7 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n422 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n53 contributors made commits (not counting the vcpkg maintainers).\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,400 forks and 23,200 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2024.10.21 release)\nThe following changes were made in October:\nAdded support for Azure universal packages as a binary caching provider (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1491).\nOther minor improvements.\nDocumentation changes\nAdded reference documentation for binary caching with Azure universal packages as a back-end (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#414).\nUpdated links, fixed typos, and added some clarifications to usage examples for vcpkg maintainer functions (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#381, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nClarified how default features should be used for vcpkg ports in maintainer guide (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#410).\nUpdated docs for vcpkg supported host environments (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#415).\nImprovements to example for packaging GitHub repos in vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#405, thanks @andre-nguyen!).\nFixed nuget command for setapikey in Set up a vcpkg binary cache using a NuGet feed tutorial (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#381, thanks @Thomas1664!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,361\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,261\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,261\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,281\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,960\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,307\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,276\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,336\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,209\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,132\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,635\n\n\nx64-android\n1,713\n\n\narm64-android\n1,685\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Microsoft C++ team attended CppCon, the largest C++ conference in the world. This year, the conference was held in Aurora, Colorado from September 16-20.\nMicrosoft Booth\nOur team managed a booth from Monday to Thursday of the week. This gave us an amazing opportunity to interact with the C++ community and discuss many topics of interest as well as hear feedback from our customers.\n\nThe following people worked at the booth (from left to right in the picture above):\nVictor Ciura, who works on Rust and C++ interop. He presented a talk called So You Think You Can Hash.\nMryam Girmay, who works on Visual Studio productivity features. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nSinem Akinci, who works on CMake tooling in the Visual Studio IDE and Visual Studio Code. Sinem also works on GitHub Copilot. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nAugustin Popa (me), and I work on the vcpkg package manager. My talk was called 10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them.\nAlexandra Kemper, who works on the C++ experience in Visual Studio Code. She was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio Code talk.\nMichael Price, who works on C++ integration with developer services like GitHub and Microsoft Dev Box. He was one of the co-presenters of this year’s What’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers talk.\nMicrosoft works on several developer tools for C++, including the Visual Studio IDE, Visual Studio Code, the MSVC compiler toolset, GitHub Copilot for C++, and the vcpkg package manager. We interacted with hundreds of C++ developers across a variety of different industries, experience levels, and familiarity with our product offerings. There were folks who had been using our products before their names started with “Visual”, and some that had never used our tools at all.\nWe were excited to see so much interest from developers for C++ best practices and how to become more productive. We received some great feedback about how we could improve our tools, in terms of bug reports, user experience improvements, and feature requests. We were also able to have several 1 on 1 longer discussions away from the booth to help people solve more specific challenges using Microsoft C++ developer tools.\n\nAt the booth we also gave out some cool swag, including USB adapters, vcpkg bags, stickers, and the ever-popular Visual Studio socks.\nWe also held a raffle at the end of each day at our booth, for some Visual Studio backpacks and tote bags.\n\n\n\nKeynote Talk: Peering forward – C++’s next decade\nAs usual, Herb Sutter delivered an excellent talk at CppCon. This year it was a keynote that looks forward in time, describing the planned evolution of the C++ language. The main topics were reflection, safety, and simplicity. These topics were effectively previews for a number of other C++ talks that elaborated on these topics in great detail.\n\n\nMicrosoft Talks at CppCon 2024\nAside from Herb’s keynote, there were several other talks delivered by folks from Microsoft at CppCon this year.\nSo You Think You Can Hash\nVictor delivered a talk on fundamentals of data structure design, focusing on computing hashes for aggregated user-defined types and experimenting with various hash algorithms. He introduced a method for experimenting with and benchmarking different hash algorithms. This allows easy switching of hashing algorithms used by complex data structures, enabling easy comparisons. This way, hash algorithm designers can concentrate on designing better hash algorithms, with little worry about how these new algorithms can be incorporated into existing code. Type designers can create their hash support just once, without worrying about what hashing algorithm should be used.\n\nThe talk spurred a bunch of hallway conversations on tradeoffs between performance and flexibility of type design, with attendees sharing their project pains and workarounds in this space.\n10 Problems Large Companies Have with Managing C++ Dependencies and How to Solve Them\nI presented a talk on 10 problems that large companies have with C++ dependency management, based on many conversations I had this year with enterprise teams. I also went over how these companies are solving these problems. About half of the problems are solvable with a modern package manager, but the rest require additional investments in development workflows. The talk was well attended and there were some good conversations afterward about the problems.\n\nToday, developers are still more likely to manually manage their dependencies than to use a package manager and consider managing libraries a top pain point for C++, according to ISO C++ surveys. I pointed out some ways that a package manager like vcpkg can mitigate the pain. Here are a few examples:\nSupporting build from source as a fallback without sacrificing the build-time savings of binary dependency acquisition.\nUpgrading dependencies as a set using baselines, rather than managing them individually, to avoid version conflicts / diamond problems.\nHow to continue working in an offline build environment using asset caching.\nGetting any open-source libraries installed and working with your project with minimal effort, while also automatically resolving transitive dependencies.\nIn the second half of the talk, I noted that security is top of mind for enterprises, so vulnerability monitoring, detection, and response is critical. Some enterprises have also started using Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) to track their dependencies and manage risk. I also pointed out that vcpkg generates SPDX SBOM files for dependencies.\nLastly, I spoke about some workflow changes that make it more manageable to do C++ development at scale, at a large company with many distributed teams. This includes centralizing common development tasks with dedicated core teams, moving to container-based builds and a standardized global build toolchain, and how to handle a large migration to a new software system by breaking it down into smaller, manageable milestones where you get a win at each step.\n\nAfter my talk, I talked with several folks about the problems they were dealing with at their work and what they had in common with the themes of the talk. In my opinion, one of the best things about delivering a talk is the conversations that happen afterward, which lead to new ideas and approaches to improve our software.\nEmbracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security\nAmanda Rousseau delivered a compelling talk on thinking like an adversary with respect to C++ security. She walked through some attack scenarios, vulnerability trends, exploits that actually exist out in the wild, and general strategies for C++ development. For Microsoft, security is always top of mind, and it was interesting hearing from her experiences about how to address these growing concerns.\n\nWhat’s new for Visual Studio Code: Performance, GitHub Copilot, and CMake Enhancements\nThe annual Visual Studio Code talk, delivered this year by Alexandra Kemper and Sinem Akinci, was packed full of updates for C++ developers. Enhancing performance for C++ developers was a top priority for our team, and the talk announced several updates to make the C++ development process faster, including updates to project start-up time and time to colorization. The talk featured enhancements to C++ Copilot completions, sample AI-assisted workflows in C++ code, and new Copilot extensibility points available for developers to tailor the AI tool to their workflow. Demonstrating the chat extension API extensibility points to CppCon via a @CppCon chat participant piqued interest in the crowd. The docs to learn more about these APIs available can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat.\n\n\nThe demo code that was used can be found below. The first demo focused on C++, CMake, and Copilot functionality whereas the second demo focused on a CppCon chat participant for Copilot.\nsinemakinci1/Cpp-Copilot-VSC-Demo at alex-gui-2\nsinemakinci1/cppcon-chat-participant: Chat participant for CppCon\n\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers\nMryam Girmay and Michael Price presented the 10th annual session demonstrating new features for C++ developers in Visual Studio. Highlighted this year were features to make you a more productive C++ developer, from shrinking your build times with Build Insights and Include Diagnostics, to reducing the amount of time you spend crafting the perfect commit message for those changes you’ve accumulated throughout the day, by letting GitHub Copilot write a first draft for you.\n\nVisual Studio leverages the power of GitHub Copilot to reduce the burden of routine tasks like sketching out unit tests for a function you just wrote or wading through pages of template error messages to understand what you’ve done wrong. And in the talk, Michael and Mryam demonstrated the soon-to-be-generally available content exclusion feature that you can configure to prevent contents from specified files never get sent in a prompt to GitHub Copilot. They also showcased interactive demos, allowing developers to see firsthand how these new features can be leveraged in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nAfter the talk, developers shared valuable feedback on Visual Studio, the Microsoft C++ compiler, and GitHub Copilot. Attendees came with questions and offered several suggestions on how we can further improve our products for them. This input is crucial as the team continues to refine and enhance the tool to better meet the needs of C++ developers.\n\nSome Other Interesting Talks\nThere were many great talks this year. Below are a few that we enjoyed.\nCommon Package Specification (CPS) in practice: A full round trip implementation in Conan C++ package manager\nDiego Rodriguez-Losada Gonzalez of JFrog delivered a very interesting talk where he demoed integrated Common Package Specification (CPS) files with various build systems, including CMake, MSBuild, Autotools, and Meson. The Common Package Specification is a mechanism for describing the useful artifacts of a software package and is a collaborative effort between several software vendors, build system maintainers, library authors, and large companies to eventually standardize such a system across the industry.\nCreating a Sender/Receiver HTTP Server\nThis session was a live-coding demo with building an HTTP server from scratch and debugging problems using C++26 sender/receivers.\nPerformance engineering – Being friendly to your hardware\nExcellent crash course on hardware details, from DRAM inner-workings to CPUs and how to write software to avoid angering the machine.\nSender Patterns to Wrangle Concurrency in Embedded Devices\nSuperb introduction to bare-metal senders and receivers and very crisp explanations of the async examples.\nC++/Rust Interop: Using Bridges in Practice\nQuick tour of the Rust/C++ interop essentials and some of the friction points in hybrid-code projects.\nTheme: Reflection\nEvery CppCon, there tends to be a big focus on some major feature that is coming up in the language. For a long time, that used to be modules. Now that modules are successfully baked into many of our developer tools and are seeing some adoption, the biggest discussion topic has moved to reflection. Reflection is a significant feature improvement that many of us have looked forward to for years, and our patience is getting rewarded. Aside from Herb’s keynote, there were several talks, including Reflection based libraries to look forward to (by Saksham Sharma), Reflection is Not Contemplation (by Andrei Alexandrescu), and Implementing Reflection using the new C++20 Tooling Opportunity: Modules (by Maiko Steeman). Lastly, Daveed Vandevoorde’s Gazing Beyond Reflection for C++26 went into some excellent technical detail while giving a preview of what’s to come and is worth checking out.\nTheme: C++ Security\nWe have all seen the headlines from industry analysts and governments over the past few years citing concerns with code safety or security in C++. This is a big focus area for the C++ Committee as well as large companies that must worry about rising threats to their business. Some specialized talks included: Security Beyond Memory Safety – Using Modern C++ to Avoid Vulnerabilities by Design (by Max Hoffmann), Embracing an Adversarial Mindset for C++ Security (by Amanda Rousseau), Building Safe and Reliable Surgical Robotics (by Milad Khaledyan), Modern C++ Error Handling (by Phil Nash), Mix Assertion, Logging, Unit Testing and Fuzzing: Build Safer Modern C++ Applications (by Xiaofan Sun), “Pick a random number… no, not that one!” – Tales of Real-World Exploits Based on Bad Randomness (by Max Hoffmann), and Compile-time Validation (by Alon Wolf).\nIn addition, LLVM’s Realtime Safety Revolution: Tools for Modern Mission Critical Systems (by Christopher Apple and David Trevelyan) introduced the new Realtime Sanitizer, which detects calls to malloc, pthread_mutex_lock, and other problematic functions in your realtime code at runtime!\nLastly, there was also an expert-led Safety and Security Panel to check out too.\nWomen’s Luncheon\nThe Women’s Networking Luncheon was a fun and resourceful event. Alexandra, Mryam, and Sinem from Microsoft’s team attended. Each table buzzed with interesting discussions: women in tech, inspirations to join the programming world, various work experiences, and ideas to inspire the next generation of women. With table rotations, attendees had the chance to talk to different people in the room. The relaxed atmosphere fostered connections among women from diverse companies and places who share an interest in C++ and programming.\nConclusion\nIt was great to meet many of you in person this year at CppCon. We enjoyed our time there and learned a lot from the C++ community and have taken back our learnings to our day-to-day work. If you didn’t get a chance to attend or missed out on some of the sessions, remember to check out all the CppCon talk on the conference’s YouTube channel as they get rolled out! We also made a playlist of past Microsoft CppCon sessions. We look forward to seeing you again next year.\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2024: Trip Report appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "link": "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/analyzing-the-performance-of-the-proxy-library/",
        "pubDate": "Fri, 01 Nov 2024 16:06:51 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "Since the recent announcement of the Proxy 3 library, we have received much positive feedback, and there have been numerous inquiries regarding the library’s actual performance. Although the “Proxy” library is designed to be fast, fulfilling one of our six core missions, it is not immediately clear how fast “Proxy” can be across different platforms and scenarios.\nTo better understand the performance of the “Proxy” library, we designed 15 benchmarks, tested in four different environments, and automated them in our GitHub pipeline to generate benchmarking reports for every code change in the future. Everyone can download the reports and raw benchmarking data attached to each build. The rest of this article delves into the benchmarking details. The numbers shown below were generated from a recent CI build.\nIndirect Invocation\nBoth proxy objects and virtual functions can perform indirect invocations. However, since they have different semantics and memory layout, it should be interesting to see how they compare to each other.\nBecause make_proxy can effectively place a small object alongside metadata (similar to “small buffer optimization” in some other C++ libraries), the benchmarks are divided into two categories: invocation on small objects (4 bytes) and on large objects (48 bytes). By invoking 1,000,000 object of 100 different types, we got the first two rows of the report:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nIndirect invocation on small objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 261.7% faster\nproxy is about 44.6% faster\nproxy is about 71.6% faster\nproxy is about 4.0% faster\n\n\nIndirect invocation on large objects via proxy vs. virtual functions\nproxy is about 186.1% faster\nproxy is about 15.5% faster\nproxy is about 17.0% faster\nproxy is about 10.5% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the report, proxy is faster in all four environments, especially on Windows Server. This result is expected because the implementation of proxy directly stores the metadata of the underlying object, making it more cache-friendly.\nLifetime Management\nIn many applications, lifetime management of various objects can become a performance hotspot compared to indirect invocations. We benchmarked this scenario by creating 600,000 small or large objects within a single std::vector (with reserved space).\nBesides proxy, there are three typical standard options for storing arbitrary types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::any. std::variant is not included because it is essentially a tagged union and can only provide storage for a known set of types (though useful in data context management).\nFor small objects, proxy and std::any usually won’t allocate additional storage. For large objects, proxy and std::shared_ptr offer allocator support (via pro::allocate_proxy and std::allocate_shared) to improve performance, while there is no direct API to customize std::unique_ptr or std::any.\nHere are the types we used in the benchmarks:\nSmall types\nLarge types\n\n\n\n\nint\nstd::array<char, 100>\n\n\nstd::shared_ptr<int>\nstd::array<std::string, 3>\n\n\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex>\nstd::unique_lock<std::mutex> + void*[15]\n\n\n\nBy comparing proxy with other solutions, we got the following numbers:\n\nMSVC on Windows Server 2022 (x64)\nGCC on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nClang on Ubuntu 24.04 (x64)\nApple Clang on macOS 15 (ARM64)\n\n\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 467.0% faster\nproxy is about 413.0% faster\nproxy is about 430.1% faster\nproxy is about 341.1% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (without memory pool)\nproxy is about 639.2% faster\nproxy is about 509.3% faster\nproxy is about 492.5% faster\nproxy is about 484.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (with memory pool)\nproxy is about 198.4% faster\nproxy is about 696.1% faster\nproxy is about 660.0% faster\nproxy is about 188.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for small objects with proxy vs. std::any\nproxy is about 55.3% faster\nproxy is about 311.0% faster\nproxy is about 323.0% faster\nproxy is about 18.3% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 17.4% faster\nproxy is about 14.8% faster\nproxy is about 29.7% faster\nproxy is about 6.3% slower\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::unique_ptr\nproxy is about 283.6% faster\nproxy is about 109.6% faster\nproxy is about 204.6% faster\nproxy is about 88.6% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both without memory pool)\nproxy is about 29.2% faster\nproxy is about 6.4% faster\nproxy is about 6.5% faster\nproxy is about 4.8% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy vs. std::shared_ptr (both with memory pool)\nproxy is about 10.8% faster\nproxy is about 9.9% faster\nproxy is about 8.3% faster\nproxy is about 53.2% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (without memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 13.4% faster\nproxy is about 1.3% slower\nproxy is about 0.9% faster\nproxy is about 9.5% faster\n\n\nBasic lifetime management for large objects with proxy (with memory pool) vs. std::any\nproxy is about 270.7% faster\nproxy is about 80.1% faster\nproxy is about 136.9% faster\nproxy is about 120.4% faster\n\n\n\nFrom the benchmarking results:\nproxy is much faster than any other 3 when the underlying object is small, or managed with memory pools.\nproxy is slightly slower than std::unique_ptr when the underlying object is large and not managed with a memory pool.\nThe performance of std::any varies in different environments, but is generally slower than proxy.\nSummary\nAlthough the test environments (GitHub-hosted runners) may differ from actual production environments, the test results show significant performance advantages of proxy in both indirect invocations and lifetime management.

Below is a brief overview of the major features and bug fixes that will be included in CLion 2024.3 and are already available in Beta.\nThe key features\nThroughout the 2024.3 EAP, we’ve added a variety of features for CLion Nova, embedded\ndevelopment, debugging, and more. Here are the most important ones.\nCLion Nova\nSome editor-related features, such as the call hierarchy, the gutter icon for recursive calls, and the Quick Definition popup have improved the user experience when working with CLion Nova.\nThe IDE frontend and backend improvements have significantly reduced CLion Nova’s memory footprint. This is particularly evident when handling large projects like Chromium.\nPredefined code styles from other projects allow you to choose from LLVM, Google, Qt, GNU, and more.\nEmbedded development\nThe Debug Servers configuration option helps you streamline the process of configuring debugging for embedded and remote development.\nSupport for debugging Zephyr West applications makes it easy to configure and run West debugging sessions directly in the IDE.\nEditable peripheral register values allow you to test different configurations and device states during debugging sessions without recompiling your source code or reloading your application or board.\nCLion’s static analysis toolset now includes a significant number of MISRA C++: 2023 checks, offering recommendations for using C++17 in safety-critical systems.\nDebugger\nWith the OpenCV image viewer, you can now view a two-dimensional OpenCV array as an image while debugging. Such an image is displayed in a separate dialog with various editing options.\nThe ability to attach the debugger to an unstarted process is helpful when you need to debug an executable launched by a third-party program or a script.\nYou can now view strings with JSON, XML, or HTML data formatted according to their code style directly in the debugger.\nOther features\nUpdated cloud completion powered by JetBrains AI Assistant now offers a wider range of usage scenarios and improved multiline code suggestions.\nProject status notifications have been moved from the top of the editor to a new widget in the status bar, making them less distracting.\nIf you’re just starting with CLion, you’ll notice the improved onboarding tips, which give you a clearer picture of the IDE’s capabilities right from the start.\nThe key bug fixes\nHere are the major bug fixes that we’ve included in CLion 2024.3 Beta:\nWhen a board is not defined for a new Zephyr West project or a West executable path is incorrect, CLion now warns you of the problem and offers to fix it. You’ll get a link that will take you to the corresponding section of your project settings, where you can define the board or path.\nThe Refresh button in the Call Hierarchy tool window now works as intended when the actual call hierarchy in the source code has been changed.\nAI Assistant again highlights C/C++ code in the chat when you ask it to explain code or suggest a refactoring, for example.\n\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD CLION 2024.3 BETA\nYour CLion team\nJetBrains\nThe Drive to Develop",

        "link": "https://blog.jetbrains.com/teamcity/2024/11/unreal-engine-plugin-ugs-integration-and-open-sourcing/",
        "pubDate": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 14:44:18 +0000",
        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’ve got a few exciting updates about the Unreal Engine plugin announced in the previous blog post. \nTL;DR – we’re adding Unreal Game Sync (UGS) integration and open-sourcing the plugin. These updates are all about making the CI/CD experience smoother for Unreal Engine devs and getting the community more involved.\nUGS\nBefore diving in, let’s quickly go over what Unreal Game Sync (UGS) is for anyone who might not be familiar with it or could use a refresher. In essence, UGS is a lightweight UI for Perforce. Typically, you need to build it from source to get started, and while its graphical client is a WinForms application available only on Windows, there is a command-line interface (CLI) version for other platforms. UGS has been around for a while and is widely used by game studios working with Unreal Engine as a collaboration tool.\nFrom a CI/CD perspective, UGS provides valuable insights into a project’s status (if properly set up), such as build statuses, the ability to flag specific changelists as problematic, and more. To give a better overview, here’s a rough diagram of the components involved:\n\n\n\n\nThere are quite a few components here, with the central one being the Metadata Server. While deploying it isn’t strictly necessary, it does enable the full feature set of UGS. This is also where CI/CD systems post build information. As shown, there are different possible implementations of the Metadata Server, and it’s worth briefly discussing each:\nEpic Metadata Service. This is the original and longest-standing version of the Metadata Server. It requires Windows, IIS, and the older .NET Framework 4.6.2.\nThird-party implementation. Thanks to the open-source nature of the server, it’s possible to create your own implementation. One example is RUGS, which is much easier to set up since it supports Docker.\nHorde. Technically, this is a full-fledged automation platform recently introduced by Epic. It includes a built-in UGS Metadata Server as well as its own build system. Although it has a built-in metadata server, it doesn’t allow publishing from external sources – the transition to Horde assumes that all metadata is generated internally. Horde is a bit outside the scope of this blog post, so we’re only mentioning it for the sake of completeness.\nEntities that the build system is supposed to post to the metadata server are called “badges” in UGS terms. These badges will then show up in the CIS (continuous integration status) column in UGS. It usually looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nAs far as we know, the metadata server endpoints don’t currently have authentication. It appears that the server is intended to be used within a secure, closed network, but this is just our understanding and not an official statement.\nFor a more complete definition of UGS please refer to the official documentation.\nUGS Integration in TeamCity\nLet’s take a look at UGS integration in TeamCity. As of the most recent plugin update, we support these two scenarios:\nPublishing a badge as a build status via the Commit Status Publisher.\nPublishing an arbitrary set of badges defined in your BuildGraph script.\nThis applies to the “distributed” execution mode – a special runner mode in which the BuildGraph definition of the build is converted into a set of builds in TeamCity (build chain). For more details, please refer to our previous blog post or the plugin documentation.\nThe first scenario is pretty straightforward. You only need to configure the Commit Status Publisher build feature and set up a few required parameters.\n\n\n\n\nThe second scenario is more complex. In your script, you can define a set of badges and link them to specific nodes to be tracked. Before diving into the scripts, here’s a quick reminder of how the plugin maps BuildGraph entities to TeamCity entities:\n\nBuildGraphTeamCity\nNodeBuild step\nAgentBuild\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, if your build process includes compiling an editor, the script might look like this (with unimportant details omitted):\n<Agent Name=\"Build Editor and tools\" Type=\"...\">\n    <Node Name=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Tools\" Requires=\"Set binary version\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n\n    <Node Name=\"Compile Editor\" Requires=\"Compile Tools\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"Compile Editor\" Project=\"//UE5/Main/Samples/Games/Lyra\" Requires=\"Compile Editor\"/>\nHere, we define a badge named “Compile Editor” to track the execution of a node with the same name. In distributed BuildGraph mode, TeamCity will recognize this badge and update the build status as the process progresses.\nYou can define multiple badges to track different sets of nodes, and TeamCity will monitor all of them based on the specified dependencies:\n<Agent Name=\"Build A\" Type=\"A\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 1\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build B\" Type=\"B\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 2\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Agent Name=\"Build C\" Type=\"C\">\n    <Node Name=\"Node 3\">\n        ...\n    </Node>\n</Agent>\n\n<Badge Name=\"BuildProject\" Project=\"//foo/bar/project\" Requires=\"Node A;Node B;Node C\"/>\nIn this example, there are three agents (each with a single node) that can potentially run concurrently, as they are assigned to different agents and have no dependencies on each other. Each build is tracked by a corresponding badge.\nThe badge will behave as follows:\n“Starting” – displayed as soon as any tracked dependency begins execution.\n“Success” – shown when all dependencies complete successfully.\n“Failure” – Indicated if any dependency encounters an error.\nFor complete examples, please refer to the plugin’s user guide on GitHub.\nOpen-sourcing the Plugin\nWe have received a lot of feedback since the plugin was introduced in May this year. Thank you to everyone who shared ideas for further development, submitted feature requests, or reported bugs! We’ve also been asked several times whether we’re going to open-source the plugin and, if so, when. That time is now!\nWith this step, we hope to:\nIncrease transparency and trust in the plugin’s codebase.\nEngage the community for contributions and improvements.\nSpeed up bug fixes and feature implementations.\nThe source code is now available on GitHub and the latest release is ready for download on the marketplace. We encourage you to submit feature requests, report any bugs you encounter, suggest enhancements, or fork the plugin and customize it to fit your needs.\nCheers!",

With this release, we’ve improved the IDE experience when working with multiple modules and project.yaml files, made nested completion in Amper configuration files more powerful, introduced support for Compose Resources and KSP2, improved Android release builds, and more!\nFor the full list of changes and bug fixes in Amper 0.5.0, see the release notes.\nTo get support for Amper’s latest features, use Fleet 1.42 or IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTooling support for working with modules and project files\nIn the previous update, we introduced project files for standalone Amper projects. With this release, you’ll now get additional tooling to work with these files.\nWhen working in the configuration file of a newly created module, you’ll see a warning and a quick-fix that helps you add it to the list of modules:\n\n\n\n\nWhen referencing a module that doesn’t exist yet, you can use a quick-fix to create that new module:\n\n\n\n\nImproved nested completion\nThe settings block in Amper files offers nested completion for all of the available values you can configure, letting you easily search for values even if you don’t know where in the structure they’re nested.\nTo make this even more convenient, you’ll now get this completion support even when you’re at the top level of a module file:\n\n\n\n\nCompose resources\nYou can now use Compose Multiplatform resources in standalone Amper projects, which allows you to easily access images, strings, fonts, and files in your Compose application.\n\n\n\n\nYou can configure resources under settings.compose to change the package name or the visibility of the generated Res class:\nsettings:\n  compose:\n    enabled: true\n    resources:\n      packageName: com.example.app\n      exposedAccessors: true\nKotlin Symbol Processing\nThe standalone version of Amper now has support for Kotlin Symbol Processing. Many third-party libraries use KSP to generate code as part of the compilation process.\nAmper works with KSP2, so any processors used must be updated for KSP2 as well. We’re expecting most processors to make this upgrade soon, as KSP1 is deprecated and will no longer be supported in Kotlin 2.1. However, at the time of this release, you might still see some gaps in support, such as issues with native targets.\nTo add a processor to your module, use the settings.kotlin.ksp section. You can also specify the options that you want to pass to KSP here.\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\n      processorOptions:\n        room.schemaLocation: ./schema\nIn multiplatform modules, configuration in the settings block is applied to all platforms by default, including KSP processors. If you need to specify which platforms to run a KSP processor on, use a settings block with a platform qualifier:\nsettings@android:\n  kotlin:\n    ksp:\n      processors:\n        - androidx.room:room-compiler:2.7.0-alpha09\nAndroid release builds\nAmper can now create signed release builds of Android apps in both Gradle-based and standalone Amper projects. These builds will use R8 automatically, with minification and shrinking enabled.\nTo enable signing for release builds, use the new android.signing option in the settings block:\nsettings:\n  android:\n    signing: enabled\nYou can provide the signing details by creating a keystore.properties file in the module:\nstoreFile=/Users/example/.keystores/release.keystore\nstorePassword=store_password\nkeyAlias=alias\nkeyPassword=key_password\nThere are options available to customize R8’s obfuscation and to change the location of the properties file containing the signing details. Amper can also generate a new keystore for you if you don’t have one already.\nYou can refer to the documentation about configuring Android builds for more details, and you can also look at samples to see custom Proguard configuration in both standalone and Gradle-based Amper projects.\nParcelize support for Android\nIn projects using the standalone version of Amper, you can now turn on the Parcelize plugin for Android, using the new settings entry: \nsettings:\n  android:\n    parcelize: enabled\nThis lets you annotate Parcelable classes with @Parcelize to generate an implementation automatically:\nimport kotlinx.parcelize.Parcelize\n\n@Parcelize\nclass User(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, val age: Int): Parcelable\nAs Parcelize is an Android-specific feature, it requires some additional configuration in multiplatform projects, which is described in the documentation.\nUpdated dependencies and defaults\nAmper now uses these new versions of dependencies and default values:\nKotlin 2.0.20\nKotlin language version 2.0\nAndroid Gradle Plugin 8.5.0\nAndroid compile SDK and target SDK 35\nThis release also uses kotlinx.serialization 1.7.3 by default and allows you to customize this version if needed:\nsettings:\n  kotlin:\n    serialization:\n      enabled: true\n      version: 1.7.3\nTo make it easier to set up serialization for various formats, the required dependencies are available from the built-in version catalog:\ndependencies:\n  - $kotlin.serialization.json\n  - $kotlin.serialization.protobuf\nNew, unified cache folder\nThere is now a unified location for caching downloaded dependencies, whether Amper is invoked from the command line or used in an IDE. The ~/.amper folder that was used in previous versions can be safely deleted.\nThe new cache locations are as follows:\nOn Windows: ~/AppData/Local/Amper\nOn macOS: ~/Library/Caches/Amper\nOn Linux: ~/.cache/Amper (or if XDG_CACHE_HOME is defined, $XDG_CACHE_HOME/.cache/Amper) \nUpdate your existing projects\nTo update a project using the standalone version of Amper, update your amper scripts by following the download instructions on the Usage page of the documentation.\nIf you’re using a Gradle-based Amper project, update your plugin version to 0.5.0:\nplugins {\n   id(\"org.jetbrains.amper.settings.plugin\").version(\"0.5.0\")\n}\nTry Amper\nTo get started with Amper, try the sample projects with standalone Amper or the samples with Gradle-based projects.\nFor full support of the latest Amper features, use Fleet 1.42 and IntelliJ IDEA 2024.3 (or later versions).\nTry Amper\n                                                    \nShare your feedback\nAmper is still experimental and under active development. You can provide feedback about your experience by joining the discussion in the Kotlinlang Slack’s #amper channel or sharing your suggestions and ideas in a YouTrack issue. Your input and your use cases help shape the future of Amper!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Java Annotated Monthly is here! Check out the latest news across Java, Spring, AI, and emerging technologies. We offer practical tutorials to enhance your skills, a curated list of November’s top tech events, both online and offline, and an exclusive feature by industry expert Mala Gupta.\nStay informed, and stay ahead!\nFeatured Content \nJava Developer Advocate with JetBrains, a Java Champion, and a JUG leader, Mala Gupta has authored multiple books with Manning, Packt, and O’Reilly Publications. She has more than two decades of experience in the software industry and is a regular speaker at industry conferences around the world. She is a vocal supporter of Java certification as a path to career advancement.\nIn this featured section, I want to highlight ‘JEP Explained‘ – a collection of heartfelt conversations with the Java architects and experts who helped bring Java 23 features to life. These conversations dive into JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs), which are the key features planned for each JDK release. Our hope with this series is to help developers, teams, and anyone passionate about Java not just understand the new Java features, but to look beyond the syntax and dig into the bigger picture with behind-the-scenes stories and the experiences of experts. Here’s the link to the blog post and YouTube playlist.\nJava 23, released in September 2024, has twelve JEPs, and the ‘JEP Explained’ series covers eleven of them. Each conversation packs a bunch of information beyond the JEP itself. For instance, when we talked with Brian Goetz about JEP 455 (about the addition of primitive types to pattern matching), he also talked about balancing new features and complexity in software development, why compiler writers love pattern matching, how designing a feature is often a lesson in humility, and how the evolution of design is an organic process. If this sounds interesting to you, check out the complete interview for more insights from Brian, Aggelos Biboudis, and Tagir Valeev, as they all discuss the inclusion of primitive types in pattern matching.\n99% of developers I talked with believe that one of the reasons for deprecating an API in Java is the availability of better APIs. Ron Pressler stated this is never the case, when we talked with him about JEP 471 (deprecation of Memory-Access Methods in the sun.misc.Unsafe class). Ron also talked about ‘Tip and Tail: a smarter way to manage codebases for different JDKs’, whether folks are swimming naked when they use outdated code, the real secret to performance gains, and much more. Check out this conversation with Ron for more insights.\nWe had another interesting conversation with Viktor Klang and Tagir Valeev about Stream Gatherers in the Streams API. Apart from discussing JEP 473, Viktor touched on topics such as ‘The Power of Simplicity in Software Design’ and how bugs can’t hide in simplicity. He shared how the built-in gatherers can inspire folks, show what this feature can do, help them to get started using them, and then help them create custom gatherers. Viktor also shared why he loves to use JShell for prototyping. Tagir shared that the most complex code that he has ever written was for a Stream API library that he created, streamex. Check out the full interview for more stories.\nIt was a pleasure to talk about being able to use Markdown for writing documentation comments in JavaDoc with Jonathan Gibbons, owner of JEP 467, and Dmitry Chuyko. Jonathan talked about making Java more approachable by simplifying its documentation with Markdown. He discussed why Markdown is a game changer for JavaDoc and addressed which Markdown flavor to use. Dmitry talked about a challenge related to documentation at work – what happens when the documentation of a codebase is larger than its codebase? Check out the full interview here.\nIt was an honor and a privilege to interview all of these Java architects and experts for the JEP Explained interview series: Dr. Venkat Subramaniam, Ken Fogel, Rafael Winterhalter, José Paumard, Zoran Sevarac, Monica Beckwith, Paul Bakker, and Gavin Bierman.\nThough I would have loved to, it is not feasible to highlight all of the fantastic “aha!” moments and learning I experienced while talking with all the guests. Check out the playlist of JEP Explained interviews and this blog post for more details.\nJava News\nJava News Roundup 1, 2, 3, 4 – As usual, the most detailed news digest on all things Java is here.\nThe Inside Java Newsletter: Welcome Java 23! – All the news about the recent release of Java 23 and the related events is conveniently grouped here.\nCheck out some helpful info on the JEPs in progress: \nJEP 14: The Tip & Tail Model of Library Development\nJEP 485: Stream Gatherers\nJEP 484: Class-File API\nJEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1\nJEP 489: Vector API (9th Incubator)\nJEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNI\nBig News from Project Valhalla – Inside Java Newscast #77 – Nicolai Parlog discusses Project Valhalla’s latest draft proposal, which introduces value classes, null-restricted types, and other enhancements.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "As a language that emerged over 14 years ago, Go has many use cases. From web development, APIs, and CLIs to Wasm, cloud technologies, and even AI-powered tools, its applications are broad. \nThe same goes for demo projects, which have countless variations and purposes!\nNow, wouldn’t it be great if there was a full-stack, API-oriented, and well-maintained demo project for Go? If you’ve ever experienced a demo project fail during a live presentation, then you’d certainly appreciate a more stable project! \nIn this blog post, I’ll walk you through the process of creating such a project – a full-stack app using Go and React.\nCheck out the source code here to follow along.\nIntroducing Go Eats\nGo Eats is an open-source project similar to the food delivery apps you’ve probably seen and used before. The project simulates the operations involved when placing an order in a real-world food delivery app.\nTo build Go Eats, I used Go as the programming language, Postgres as the database, React for the frontend, and NATS for messaging. While Go is a good choice for these complex full-stack applications, finding demos can be challenging.\nI used GoLand for this project because it takes care of setting up the Go SDK, installing packages, and much more straight out of the box.\nLet’s take a closer look at the entry point of the source code: main.go. \nThis code initializes several services and handlers, establishes a database connection, loads environment variables, and sets up middleware, NATS, and the WebSocket.\nfunc main() {\n\t// load .env file\n\terr := godotenv.Load()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Error loading .env file\")\n\t}\n\n\tenv := os.Getenv(\"APP_ENV\")\n\tdb := database.New()\n\t// Create Tables\n\tif err := db.Migrate(); err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error migrating database: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\n\t// Connect NATS\n\tnatServer, err := nats.NewNATS(\"nats://127.0.0.1:4222\")\n\n\t// WebSocket Clients\n\twsClients := make(map[string]*websocket.Conn)\n\n\ts := handler.NewServer(db, true)\n\n\t// Initialize Validator\n\tvalidate := validator.New()\n\n\t// Middlewares List\n\tmiddlewares := []gin.HandlerFunc{middleware.AuthMiddleware()}\n\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\n\n\tlog.Fatal(s.Run())\n\n}\nThe journey\nI started by working on backend tasks, such as creating APIs, before moving to the frontend. I chose Gin as the framework to build these APIs.\nWhile I could have gone with Gorilla, Echo, Fiber, or any other framework, I felt Gin would be a better choice for this project. It’s more mature and stable, it’s widely used, and it’s also somewhat of a personal preference. \nBefore selecting any framework, you should carefully consider the problem you are trying to solve or the specific business goal you are trying to achieve. Then weigh up the potential solutions and opt for the best one for your specific use case.\nThe backend\nWhile creating a demo app, it’s important to ensure that the application is flexible enough to accommodate future changes and refactoring.\nFor Go Eats, I implemented a service layer pattern, along with dependency injection. Additionally, I utilized handlers for request and response communication with the service layer, which manages business logic and interacts with the database.\n\t// User\n\tuserService := usr.NewUserService(db, env)\n\tuser.NewUserHandler(s, \"/user\", userService, validate)\n\n\t// Restaurant\n\trestaurantService := restro.NewRestaurantService(db, env)\n\trestaurant.NewRestaurantHandler(s, \"/restaurant\", restaurantService)\n\n\t// Reviews\n\treviewService := review.NewReviewService(db, env)\n\trevw.NewReviewProtectedHandler(s, \"/review\", reviewService, middlewares, validate)\n\n\t// Cart\n\tcartService := cart_order.NewCartService(db, env, natServer)\n\tcrt.NewCartHandler(s, \"/cart\", cartService, middlewares, validate)\nThe project structure shown above ensures that the project is modular and flexible. Remember that creating too many nested directories can add unnecessary complexity. Especially if you’re just starting your programming journey, it’s best to focus on simplicity rather than going through multiple layers. Keep in mind that your code will inevitably need to be refactored at some point.\nThe famous quote by Donald Knuth, “Premature optimization is the root of all evil,” feels particularly apt here.\n\nI did something similar for the database. I used the lightweight Bun SQL client. \nHowever, I made sure that if I need to replace the ORM in the future, my code will be able to adapt to the new changes based on the interface I have defined below.\ntype Database interface {\n\tInsert(ctx context.Context, model any) (sql.Result, error)\n\tDelete(ctx context.Context, tableName string, filter Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tSelect(ctx context.Context, model any, columnName string, parameter any) error\n\tSelectAll(ctx context.Context, tableName string, model any) error\n\tSelectWithRelation(ctx context.Context, model any, relations []string, Condition Filter) error\n\tSelectWithMultipleFilter(ctx context.Context, model any, Condition Filter) error\n\tRaw(ctx context.Context, model any, query string, args ...interface{}) error\n\tUpdate(ctx context.Context, tableName string, Set Filter, Condition Filter) (sql.Result, error)\n\tCount(ctx context.Context, tableName string, ColumnExpression string, columnName string, parameter any) (int64, error)\n\tMigrate() error\n\tHealthCheck() bool\n\tClose() error\n}\nThis interface provides a blueprint for CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations and other common database interactions, ensuring that any struct implementing this interface can be used to perform these operations.\nGoLand keeps track of class implementation, making navigation much smoother. \nTo navigate to the implementation, press ⌘⌥B / Ctrl+Alt+B.\n\nMost of the operations involve CRUD activities. I was also eager to experiment with server-sent events (SSE) and WebSockets, which I’ve not explored much in the past. This project was a good use case for these technologies.\nLet’s begin with SSE, a technology that enables the server to push notifications, messages, and events to clients over an HTTP connection.\nThe code snippet below reads data from a JSON file and pushes the information so the client renders and displays the relevant data. \nfunc (s *AnnouncementHandler) flashNews(c *gin.Context) {\n\t_, cancel := context.WithTimeout(c.Request.Context(), 5*time.Second)\n\tdefer cancel()\n\n\tevents, err := s.service.FlashEvents()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tc.AbortWithStatusJSON(500, gin.H{\"error\": err.Error()})\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Set headers for SSE\n\tc.Header(\"Content-Type\", \"text/event-stream\")\n\tc.Header(\"Cache-Control\", \"no-cache\")\n\tc.Header(\"Connection\", \"keep-alive\")\n\n\tticker := time.NewTicker(6 * time.Second)\n\tdefer ticker.Stop()\n\n\teventIndex := 0\n\n\tfor {\n\t\tselect {\n\t\tcase <-ticker.C:\n\t\t\t// Send the current event\n\t\t\tevent := (*events)[eventIndex]\n\t\t\tc.SSEvent(\"message\", event.Message)\n\t\t\tc.Writer.Flush()\n\n\t\t\t// Move to the next event\n\t\t\teventIndex = (eventIndex + 1) % len(*events)\n\t\tcase <-c.Request.Context().Done():\n\t\t\tticker.Stop()\n\t\t\treturn\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nWebSocket and NATS\nSomething else I’ve not worked with before but have always wanted to try is using WebSockets with the NATS messaging system. I evaluated these technologies as potential solutions for the project and ultimately decided to use them in the demo app.\nHere’s how the messaging process in the Go Eats app functions: \nWhenever a new order is created, a message is published to NATS informing the subscriber about the newly placed order.\nWhen the delivery person updates the order – whether it’s on the way, has failed, or has been delivered – the customer will receive this information in real time, a process that will be reflected in the UI.\n\nThe code below defines the two topics:\norders.new.*: Sends a notification to the customer when a new order is placed.\norders.status.*: Sends a notification to the customer when the delivery status is updated.\n\n\n\n\nFor each received message, the application logs the message, extracts the user ID and message data, and attempts to send the data to the corresponding WebSocket client. If sending fails, the app logs the error, closes the WebSocket connection, and removes the client from the active client’s map.\nNote: Using map[string]*websocket.Conn to manage WebSocket connections with keys as client identifiers, such as userID, will not handle multiple connections from the same client, as the map keys must be unique. This is something I am planning to expand on in a future blog post. \nWhy NATS over Kafka?\nKafka is capable of handling large amounts of data, offering database-level durability and being enterprise-ready. \nHowever, I have never used it before, and I needed something that would work well for my specific use case. In that context, I came across NATS, which is written in Go and is ideal for lightweight, low-latency messaging, particularly in microservices and cloud-native architectures. \nA key point I would like to highlight is its simplicity. NATS was easy to use even when just starting to work with it.\nThe code below initializes a NATS connection and defines methods to publish and subscribe to messages. It connects to a NATS server, publishes messages to a topic, and forwards received messages to WebSocket clients based on user IDs.\ntype NATS struct {\n\tConn *nats.Conn\n}\n\nfunc NewNATS(url string) (*NATS, error) {\n\tnc, err := nats.Connect(url, nats.Name(\"food-delivery-nats\"))\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatalf(\"Error connecting to NATS:: %s\", err)\n\t}\n\treturn &NATS{Conn: nc}, err\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Pub(topic string, message []byte) error {\n\terr := n.Conn.Publish(topic, message)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\nfunc (n *NATS) Sub(topic string, clients map[string]*websocket.Conn) error {\n\n\t_, err := n.Conn.Subscribe(topic, func(msg *nats.Msg) {\n\t\tmessage := string(msg.Data)\n\t\tslog.Info(\"MESSAGE_REPLY_FROM_NATS\", \"RECEIVED_MESSAGE\", message)\n\t\tuserId, messageData := n.formatMessage(message)\n\t\tif conn, ok := clients[userId]; ok {\n\t\t\terr := conn.WriteMessage(websocket.TextMessage, []byte(messageData))\n\t\t\tif err != nil {\n\t\t\t\tlog.Println(\"Error sending message to client:\", err)\n\t\t\t\tconn.Close()\n\t\t\t\tdelete(clients, userId)\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\treturn err\n\t}\n\treturn nil\n}\n\n//.... For the sake of brevity, the full code snippet is omitted here.\nThe frontend\nTo build the Go Eats UI, I used React. I don’t come from a frontend background, and it was quite challenging to learn and apply unfamiliar concepts. Along the way, I took Stephen Grider’s Modern React with Redux course.\nWhile I’m certainly no expert in React, the course helped a lot. That said, it was the use of GoLand, the JetBrains IDE for Go, which proved to be most valuable throughout this process.\nGoLand has excellent support for full-stack development with less distraction and context switching. The IDE provides exceptional coding support for JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, React, and many other languages.\nUsing GoLand, I can develop frontend and backend applications with the same IDE.\n\nFinally, here is the final output of how the UI gets rendered through React. \n\nI haven’t gone into much detail about the process of developing the Go Eats frontend. However, if you’re interested, you can check out the source code here. \nSummary\nAs I reflect on my journey developing this demo app, I realize there is much to learn and many improvements that could be made.\nHere are some key lessons from this experience:\nFocus on functionality first!\nIf you’re someone who is just starting to work with Go, don’t worry about making your app scalable or more modular by focusing on dependency injection right away. These concepts will eventually be required, and you will observe the patterns and restructure accordingly. Whatever you build, it won’t be perfect at first, and that’s okay! The journey is one of incremental and constant improvements. \n\n\n\n\nPrioritize testing!\nDon’t forget the importance of regular testing. Making sure you test your project frequently provides confidence that your features work as expected. While I have worked on tests for Go Eats, I still need to improve them further. Additionally, I have tried different testing libraries, such as Testcontainers, which help me test features in a real database instead of using mock ones.\n\n\n\n\nDatabase design matters!\nSpending time on the database schema is extremely valuable. Additionally, there are database migrations, which I haven’t used, but they are quite important, especially when you’re looking for rollbacks, versioning changes, and ensuring that changes are applied in the correct order.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I’m happy with what I’ve built so far, it’s just the beginning for Go Eats. Stay tuned for more updates soon! \nI’d also love to hear your feedback. If you’ve had similar experiences or if you have thoughts on what you liked or disliked, or if you have suggestions for improvement, please share them in the comments.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "On October 20, the original author of the Fernflower Java decompiler, Stiver, passed away after a long fight against glioblastoma. \nStiver was a German programmer of Russian origin, primarily developing software for medical equipment. Twenty years ago, he developed a deep professional interest in Java virtual machine internals. You may remember his research blog posts, like this one (in Russian) from 2006 about how to tweak the Java class hierarchy using Unsafe when Java 1.5 was just released. Around 2008, Stiver became fascinated by Java decompilation.\nThe Java decompilation landscape was very poor at that time. The first generation of decompilers like JAD or JODE came to an end. While Java as a language evolved, the existing decompilers were mainly unmaintained, which limited their usefulness. New language constructs like assertion statements, annotations, and generic types were not supported. Moreover, the deprecation of JSR/RET instructions in Java bytecode caused a significant difference in how try-finally blocks are compiled. The decompilers failed to handle the new bytecode.\nAnother big problem with existing decompilers was their approach to decompilation. They simply looked for specific bytecode patterns and translated them to the corresponding Java statements and expressions. While simple, this approach is fragile – any minor semantically equivalent change in generated bytecode made proper decompilation impossible. This severely limited the decompiler application.\nStiver decided to write his own decompiler as a side project. To overcome the weaknesses of existing alternatives, he took a different approach. After reading the bytecode, he constructed a control-flow graph in static single-assignment form, which is much better to express the program semantics abstracting the particular shape of bytecode. At the beginning of this project, Stiver knew little about static analysis and compiler design and had to learn a lot, but the effort was worth it. The resulting decompiler produced much better results than anything available at that time. It could even decompile the bytecode produced by some obfuscators without any explicit support.\nStiver did the main development himself between 2008 and 2010. The first public version became available in May 2009 as a web service. A user could upload an individual CLASS file or a whole JAR file and get the decompiled result. The decompiler quickly gained popularity – during the first four months, users decompiled more than half a million Java classes. There was no public standalone version, but Stiver sent it privately to a few Beta testers. After the release, Stiver made numerous improvements and fixed many bugs thanks to early adopters.\n\n\n\n\nAfter 2010, the active development of the decompiler stopped, as Stiver became busier with his primary job. A few third-party software vendors asked Stiver to provide the decompiler for their projects. Notably, it was used with permission in Mod Coder Pack, which is a toolkit for creating mods for the game Minecraft. Still, it became difficult for a regular Java user to find a working version of Fernflower.\nIn 2013, JetBrains approached Stiver with a suggestion to include Fernflower in IntelliJ IDEA. Part of the deal was making Fernflower open source. Everything went well, and the contract was signed. On July 11, 2014, the early access version of IntelliJ IDEA 14 was released, including the decompiler for the first time. You can still see the initial import of the Fernflower source code in the IntelliJ IDEA Git history, on March 4, 2014.\nWhile Stiver was never a JetBrains employee, he helped improve the decompiler for almost a year after the initial import. As Java 8 had just been released, it was necessary to support new language constructs like lambdas. Another big challenge was integrating the decompiler with the IntelliJ IDEA debugger. Line numbers in decompiled code differ from line numbers in the original source, and Stiver helped provide a transparent mapping between them so you can seamlessly debug decompiled code.\n\n\n\n\nAs Fernflower became open source, many other tools in the Java world used it – you can find a number of forks on GitHub. The Java team at JetBrains is constantly improving Fernflower, but it’s still mainly Stiver’s code. If Fernflower hadn’t existed, we likely would have had to invest substantial resources into developing our own decompiler. This could have resulted in IntelliJ IDEA lacking a decompiler or having one that was significantly less effective. Stiver’s work was a real game-changer for Java developers over the past 10 years. With no better alternative to decompile Java bytecode, his contributions have saved developers countless hours while debugging Java code without sources. \nThank you, Stiver! We are deeply saddened by the loss of such a brilliant pioneer whose work and dedication had such a lasting and profound impact.",

Today, we’re excited to share our latest innovation – a guided chat experience within GitHub Copilot that reshapes how developers interact with AI. This guided chat experience is available in Visual Studio 2022 17.12 Preview 3 and above.\nThis guided way to chat was created with one clear goal in mind: to make interactions between developers and AI more natural, effective, and aligned with everyday workflows. It is our deep belief that conversational AI is the future of development, and we’re committed to leading that transformation.\nMaking Copilot Conversations Smarter and Simpler\nAs we’ve refined GitHub Copilot, one thing has become clear: while users appreciate the potential of AI-driven tools, there’s a learning curve. Developers have shared that crafting the right prompt can sometimes feel like a challenge—understanding how to phrase a question, knowing what context to include, and making the most of Copilot’s capabilities. In some cases, the experience left users feeling like they were getting too much or too little from their interactions.\nCustomer feedback highlights the challenge:\n“The chat experience is helpful, but I wish it felt more like an assistant—something that could help guide me and give me only what I need without extra noise.”\n“I love how Copilot just starts generating, but it sometimes feels like I have to sift through a lot to get to what I actually wanted.”\nThese insights inspired us to rethink how AI should work for developers. Rather than relying only on intent-based commands or predefined prompts, this chat allows for a more fluid, conversational experience—one that adapts to the user’s context and needs.\nHow does this work? \nOur guided chat experience takes Copilot beyond simple input-output exchanges, turning it into a collaborative assistant. When the context is clear, Copilot provides direct and relevant answers. When it isn’t, Copilot guides you by asking follow-up questions to ensure clarity and precision.\n\nThe implications are significant:\nMore Engagement: Developers spend less time figuring out how to phrase their prompts and more time focused on the task at hand.\nLess Complexity: Copilot’s ability to guide and clarify reduces the need for developers to navigate complex intent systems.\nIncreased Productivity: With less back-and-forth and more focused responses, developers can move faster through their workflows.\nIn our early trials, we’ve seen encouraging signs that Guided Chat makes a real difference. So we are excited for you all to try it out.\nAs we continue refining this guided way to chat, user feedback and engagement will be at the center of our improvements, ensuring that it delivers the intelligent and seamless experience developers need.\nThank you for your continuous feedback\nWe owe much of our progress to our users’ invaluable feedback. Your insights and suggestions have been instrumental in making Visual Studio better with each update. We appreciate your continuous support and look forward to bringing you more innovative features.\nThe post Introducing a new, more conversational way to chat with GitHub Copilot appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "A lesson about the software forensics process involved in developing the Bring Back Plus/Minus extension, which brings back the plus/minus symbols to the editor outlining feature in Visual Studio 2022.\nWhile I did have the advantage of being able to look at the Visual Studio source code, I could have figured this out just as well without it, and that’s the focus of this article.\nThe investigation of how to bring back the plus/minus symbols started with this important clue from a comment on the Developer Community feedback ticket for this issue:\nHowever, Visual Studio has a very rich extensibility model, and if users have strong feelings about the visuals in their IDE, I encourage people to try writing an extension to change the icon used here. The class that controls the expansion is this one: OutliningMarginHeaderControl\n\nA quick internet search for the class name led me to this reference article for OutliningMarginHeaderControl Class where the definition contains the following valuable information:\nNamespace: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor\nAssembly: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nPackage: Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187\nNow that we know where to find this class, it’s time to examine the assembly. For that we will use the excellent ILSpy tool, which you can install from the Microsoft Store: ILSpy Fresh\nOnce you’ve installed ILSpy, launch it and load the assembly Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll. You can find this assembly in the Visual Studio installation folder, usually in the following path:\n<VSInstallDir>\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\Editor\\Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf.dll\nAfter the assembly is loaded, search for the class OutliningMarginHeaderControl in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor namespace and you will find the following code for the static constructor:\n\nThis is where the default style key for the control is being set. The next step is to find the XAML Style for the control. For that we open the Resources node where we find themes/generic.baml, which includes the entire style for the OutliningMarginHeaderControl:\n\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n    <Style.Resources> \r\n      <ResourceDictionary> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandRight\">F1M2.146.146a.5.5,0,0,1,.708,0l4,4a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708-.708L5.793,4.5,2.146.854A.5.5,0,0,1,2.146.146Z</Geometry> \r\n        <Geometry x:Key=\"ExpandDown\">F1M8.854,2.146a.5.5,0,0,1,0,.708l-4,4a.5.5,0,0,1-.708,0l-4-4a.5.5,0,0,1,.708-.708L4.5,5.793,8.146,2.146A.5.5,0,0,1,8.854,2.146Z</Geometry> \r\n      </ResourceDictionary> \r\n    </Style.Resources> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"FrameworkElement.Cursor\" Value=\"Hand\" /> \r\n    <Setter Property=\"Template\"> \r\n      <Setter.Value> \r\n        <ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\"> \r\n          <Grid> \r\n            <Viewbox Name=\"ExpandCollapseIcon\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\"> \r\n              <Border Width=\"9\" Height=\"13\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.background}\"> \r\n                <Rectangle Name=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Width=\"9\" Height=\"9\"> \r\n                  <FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                    <ResourceDictionary> \r\n                      <SolidColorBrush x:Key=\"canvas\" Opacity=\"0\" /> \r\n                    </ResourceDictionary> \r\n                  </FrameworkElement.Resources> \r\n                  <Shape.Fill> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                      <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <DrawingGroup> \r\n                            <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandRight}\" /> \r\n                          </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush> \r\n                  </Shape.Fill> \r\n                </Rectangle> \r\n              </Border> \r\n            </Viewbox> \r\n          </Grid> \r\n          <ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n            <Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\"> \r\n              <Setter TargetName=\"ExpandCollapseRectangle\" Property=\"Shape.Fill\"> \r\n                <Setter.Value> \r\n                  <DrawingBrush Stretch=\"None\"> \r\n                    <DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                      <DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource canvas}\" Geometry=\"F1 M9,0 L9,9 L0,9 L0,0\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                        <DrawingGroup> \r\n                          <GeometryDrawing Brush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.chevron.foreground}\" Geometry=\"{StaticResource ExpandDown}\" /> \r\n                        </DrawingGroup> \r\n                      </DrawingGroup> \r\n                    </DrawingBrush.Drawing> \r\n                  </DrawingBrush> \r\n                </Setter.Value> \r\n              </Setter> \r\n            </Trigger> \r\n          </ControlTemplate.Triggers> \r\n        </ControlTemplate> \r\n      </Setter.Value> \r\n    </Setter> \r\n</Style> \r\n\nThis is the style for the new chevron symbols. Here we find interesting things like the geometry for the expand/collapse symbols, the colors, and the trigger that changes the symbol when the control is expanded. The next step is to find the original Style for the plus/minus symbols. For that we can either use an older VS installation or we can take advantage of the reference information above, which states that this control is included in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf v17.9.187 NuGet package. Now we know that the symbols changed in 17.9, so we will look for a version before that. For example, the last one before that is 17.8.222.\nWe can download the package, change its extension from .nupkg to .zip, and extract the assembly from the lib\\net472 folder. Once we have the assembly, we can load it in ILSpy and look for the original style for the control just like we did before:\n\r\n<Style x:Key=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\" TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Focusable\" Value=\"False\" />\r\n\t<Setter Property=\"Template\">\r\n\t\t<Setter.Value>\r\n\t\t\t<ControlTemplate TargetType=\"{x:Type textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl}\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"WhitePadding\" Height=\"11\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" BorderThickness=\"0,1,0,1\" VerticalAlignment=\"Center\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Border Name=\"TheSquare\" Height=\"9\" Width=\"9\" BorderBrush=\"{DynamicResource outlining.verticalrule.foreground}\" Background=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.background}\" BorderThickness=\"1\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line X1=\"1\" Y1=\"3.5\" X2=\"6\" Y2=\"3.5\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<Line Name=\"Vertical\" X1=\"3.5\" Y1=\"1\" X2=\"3.5\" Y2=\"6\" Stroke=\"{DynamicResource outlining.square.foreground}\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</Canvas>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Border>\r\n\t\t\t\t</Grid>\r\n\t\t\t\t<ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<Trigger Property=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl.IsExpanded\" Value=\"True\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"Vertical\" Property=\"Visibility\" Value=\"Hidden\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<Setter TargetName=\"TheSquare\" Value=\"{DynamicResource ViewBackgroundBrush}\" Property=\"Border.Background\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</Trigger>\r\n\t\t\t\t</ControlTemplate.Triggers>\r\n\t\t\t</ControlTemplate>\r\n\t\t</Setter.Value>\r\n\t</Setter>\r\n</Style>\r\n\nSince the new style no longer uses dynamic resources for outlining.square, we must assume that these resources are no longer available in the new version of VS. This means that we needed to replace these resources with other colors. For the foreground outlining.chevron.foreground made sense. The background was a little bit harder because outlining.chevron.background didn’t do anything. With a little experimenting I had settled on outlining.collapsehintadornment.background for the first version of the extension. Both were not ideal or what they used to be – the chevron foreground is quite a bit darker and the background for the plus symbol is a lot lighter than before, but this combination worked in both light and dark themes, and any other existing color resources would look wrong in one theme or another.\nHow to build a VSIX extension to override the style\nTo override the style, I started by creating a new VSIX project with an async package:\n\nThen I added a new ResourceDictionary file Style.xaml to the project and copied the style from the old assembly, pasted it into the ResourceDictionary, and updated it with the new color resource value. Make sure that the Build Action for this Style.xaml is set to Page. I also gave this style a key x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\", so that I can easily look it up later:\n\r\n<ResourceDictionary\r\n\txmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n\txmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\"\r\n\txmlns:textUiWpf=\"clr-namespace:Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.Editor;assembly=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Text.UI.Wpf\">\r\n\t<Style x:Key=\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\" TargetType=\"textUiWpf:OutliningMarginHeaderControl\">\r\n\t\t...\r\n\nThe last thing that needed to be done was to override the style in the InitializeAsync method of the package. The following code loads the resource dictionary, looks up the style by its key, and places it in the current application’s resources using the implicit style key typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl), so that Visual Studio will find this Style first:\n\r\nprotected override async Task InitializeAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken, IProgress progress) \r\n{ \r\n\t// When initialized asynchronously, the current thread may be a background thread at this point. \r\n\t// Do any initialization that requires the UI thread after switching to the UI thread. \r\n\tawait this.JoinableTaskFactory.SwitchToMainThreadAsync(cancellationToken); \r\n\tvar resourceDictionary = new ResourceDictionary(); \r\n\tresourceDictionary.Source = new Uri(\"pack://application:,,,/BringBackPlusMinus;component/Style.xaml\"); \r\n\tvar style = resourceDictionary[\"OriginalOutliningMarginHeaderControlStyle\"]; \r\n\tApplication.Current.Resources[typeof(OutliningMarginHeaderControl)] = style; \r\n}\r\n\nBuilding and running the project launched the experimental instance of Visual Studio and voila – the plus/minus symbols were back!\nNow all that was left to do was to update the vsixmanifest, build the extension in Release mode, and upload it to the Visual Studio Marketplace following this Walkthrough: Publish a Visual Studio extension.\nAdding support for color customization\nWhen I started using the preview builds of Visual Studio 2022 17.12, I noticed that the rendering of the plus/minus symbols was broken because the chevron symbol color definition had changed. I decided to introduce a dedicated color definition for the plus/minus symbols to avoid such problems going forward:\n\r\n[Export(typeof(EditorFormatDefinition))] \r\n[Name(OutliningExpanderIdentifier)] \r\n[UserVisible(true)] \r\ninternal sealed class OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition : EditorFormatDefinition \r\n{ \r\n\tpublic const string OutliningExpanderIdentifier = \"outlining.plusminus\"; \r\n\tpublic OutliningExpanderFormatDefinition() \r\n\t{ \r\n\t\tthis.ForegroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0x55, 0x55, 0x55); \r\n\t\tthis.BackgroundColor = Color.FromRgb(0xE2, 0xE2, 0xE2); \r\n\t\tthis.DisplayName = Strings.OutliningMarginPlusMinus; \r\n\t} \r\n}\r\n\nAs an added benefit the colors are now consistent with the original plus/minus symbols, and they can be customized in Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Fonts and Colors:\n\nTo make sure that the colors look correct in the dark theme as well, I added a ThemeColors.xml file to the project with the following content:\n\r\n<Themes> \r\n\t<Theme Name=\"Dark\" GUID=\"{1ded0138-47ce-435e-84ef-9ec1f439b749}\"> \r\n\t\t<Category Name=\"BringBackPlusMinus\" GUID=\"{063E9575-C1A8-4729-BB15-AAA2EFB44FC0}\"> \r\n\t\t\t<Color Name=\"outlining.plusminus\"> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Background Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FF000000\" /> \r\n\t\t\t\t<Foreground Type=\"CT_RAW\" Source=\"FFE2E2E2\" /> \r\n\t\t\t</Color> \r\n\t\t</Category> \r\n\t</Theme> \r\n</Themes>\r\n\nIt needs to be converted to a .pkgdef file using the VsixColorCompiler first, which is then included in the extension’s .vsixmanifest.\nConclusion\nIn summary, with a little bit of detective work we were able to locate the style for the outlining symbols, build a VSIX extension, and override the style with the original style that brings back the original plus/minus outlining buttons.\nThe source code for the extension is available on GitHub.\nThe post The making of Bring Back Plus/Minus appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

이점</span></h3><ol><li><strong>명확한 타입 정의</strong>: <code>Email</code>이라는 값 클래스를 사용함으로써, 이메일 주소를 단순히 문자열로 다루는 대신 명확한 타입으로 관리할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 이메일 값이 기대하는 형태로만 사용되도록 강제할 수 있습니다.</li><li><strong>유효성 검사 통합</strong>: 이메일과 관련된 유효성 검사 로직을 <code>Email</code> 클래스 내부에 정의함으로써, 이메일이 생성되는 모든 곳에서 일관된 유효성 검사를 적용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드 중복을 줄이고 유지보수성을 높일 수 있습니다.</li><li><strong>가독성 향상</strong>: 이메일과 같은 값 타입을 별도로 정의함으로써, 코드의 가독성을 높이고, 객체의 의미를 보다 명확하게 전달할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드가 더 직관적이며 이해하기 쉬워집니다.</li><li><strong>재사용성</strong>: <code>Email</code> 클래스는 <code>User</code> 클래스뿐만 아니라, 예를 들어 <code>Order</code>와 같은 다른 도메인 객체에서도 재사용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 일관된 이메일 관리와 유효성 검사를 보장하며, 코드 중복을 최소화할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 공통적으로 사용되는 값 타입을 재사용함으로써 코드의 유지보수성과 확장성을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다.</li></ol><h3><span id=\"value-class-사용-시-주의-사항\">Value Class 사용 시 주의 사항</span></h3><p><code>value class</code>로 감싼 타입은 JPA나 MongoDB와 같은 데이터베이스 접근 라이브러리를 사용할 때 자동으로 매핑되지 않기 때문에, 적절한 컨버터를 정의해줘야 합니다. 예를 들어, JPA에서는 <code>AttributeConverter</code>를 사용하여 <code>Email</code> 클래스를 문자열로 변환하고 다시 복원할 수 있는 컨버터를 구현해야 합니다.</p><h2><span id=\"결론\">결론</span></h2><p>코틀린에서 객체를 생성하는 다양한 방법이 있지만, 제약 사항이 많은 경우에는 <code>companion object</code>와 <code>invoke</code> 연산자를 활용하는 방식이 매우 유용합니다.

= null,\n    var name: String,\n    val email: String,\n    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)\n    var stats: UserStats\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            name: String,\n            email: String\n        ): User {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(name.isNotBlank()) { \"Name must not be blank\" }\n            require(email.isNotBlank()) { \"Email must not be blank\" }\n\n            return User(\n                name = name.trim(),\n                email = email.trim(),\n                id = null,\n                stats = UserStats.NORMAL\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n이제 외부에서 객체를 생성할 때는 다음과 같이 사용할 수 있습니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n// 안전한 객체 생성 예시\nval user = User(\n    name = \"  John Doe  \",\n    email = \"  john.doe@example.com  \"\n)\n\n\n위 코드는 기존의 생성자 호출 방식과 동일하게 사용할 수 있지만, 내부적으로는 안전한 로직을 적용하여 객체를 생성하도록 유도합니다. 이를 통해 불필요한 오류를 방지하고 객체 생성 과정을 간소화할 수 있습니다.\n주요 개선 사항\n\n기본 생성자 막기: private constructor를 사용해 기본 생성자를 외부에서 호출하지 못하게 막았습니다. 이를 통해 객체 생성을 companion object 내부의 로직으로만 유도할 수 있게 되었습니다.\ninvoke 연산자 활용: companion object에 operator fun invoke를 정의하여 객체 생성 시 사용자가 보다 명확한 API를 사용할 수 있게 했습니다. 이는 기존의 생성자 호출 방식과 동일하게 사용할 수 있으면서도 name과 email의 앞뒤 공백을 자동으로 제거하고, stats 필드는 무조건 UserStats.NORMAL로 설정하게 되었습니다.\n안전한 필드 초기화: id와 같이 외부에서 설정되면 안 되는 필드는 생성자에서 제외하여, 개발자가 실수로 이를 설정하는 것을 방지했습니다.\n\nValue Class를 활용한 값 타입 관리\n또한, 이메일과 같은 값 타입을 별도로 관리하기 위해 코틀린의 value class를 활용하는 것도 좋은 방법입니다. 아래는 Email이라는 값 클래스를 정의하고 사용하는 예시입니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n\n@JvmInline\nvalue class Email(val value: String) {\n    init {\n        require(value.isNotBlank()) { \"Email must not be blank\" }\n        require(value.contains(\"@\")) { \"Email must contain '@'\" }\n    }\n}\n\n\nEmail Value Class 적용\n위에서 정의한 Email 클래스를 User 클래스와 Order 클래스에 적용해보겠습니다:\n\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n\nclass User private constructor(\n    var id: Long? = null,\n    var name: String,\n    val email: Email,\n    var stats: UserStats\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            name: String,\n            email: String\n        ): User {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(name.isNotBlank()) { \"Name must not be blank\" }\n\n            return User(\n                name = name.trim(),\n                email = Email(email),\n                id = null,\n                stats = UserStats.NORMAL\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Order 클래스 정의\nclass Order private constructor(\n    var id: Long? = null,\n    val email: Email,\n    var amount: Double\n) {\n    companion object {\n        operator fun invoke(\n            email: String,\n            amount: Double\n        ): Order {\n            // 유효성 검사 로직 추가\n            require(amount > 0) { \"Amount must be greater than zero\" }\n\n            return Order(\n                email = Email(email),\n                id = null,\n                amount = amount\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nValue Class를 통한 객체 관리의 이점\n\n명확한 타입 정의: Email이라는 값 클래스를 사용함으로써, 이메일 주소를 단순히 문자열로 다루는 대신 명확한 타입으로 관리할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 이메일 값이 기대하는 형태로만 사용되도록 강제할 수 있습니다.\n유효성 검사 통합: 이메일과 관련된 유효성 검사 로직을 Email 클래스 내부에 정의함으로써, 이메일이 생성되는 모든 곳에서 일관된 유효성 검사를 적용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드 중복을 줄이고 유지보수성을 높일 수 있습니다.\n가독성 향상: 이메일과 같은 값 타입을 별도로 정의함으로써, 코드의 가독성을 높이고, 객체의 의미를 보다 명확하게 전달할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 코드가 더 직관적이며 이해하기 쉬워집니다.\n재사용성: Email 클래스는 User 클래스뿐만 아니라, 예를 들어 Order와 같은 다른 도메인 객체에서도 재사용할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 일관된 이메일 관리와 유효성 검사를 보장하며, 코드 중복을 최소화할 수 있습니다. 이렇게 공통적으로 사용되는 값 타입을 재사용함으로써 코드의 유지보수성과 확장성을 크게 향상시킬 수 있습니다.\n\nValue Class 사용 시 주의 사항\nvalue class로 감싼 타입은 JPA나 MongoDB와 같은 데이터베이스 접근 라이브러리를 사용할 때 자동으로 매핑되지 않기 때문에, 적절한 컨버터를 정의해줘야 합니다. 예를 들어, JPA에서는 AttributeConverter를 사용하여 Email 클래스를 문자열로 변환하고 다시 복원할 수 있는 컨버터를 구현해야 합니다.\n결론\n코틀린에서 객체를 생성하는 다양한 방법이 있지만, 제약 사항이 많은 경우에는 companion object와 invoke 연산자를 활용하는 방식이 매우 유용합니다. 또한, 값 타입을 별도로 관리하기 위해 value class를 사용하는 것도 좋은 접근법입니다. 이를 통해 외부에서 설정하지 말아야 할 필드를 보호하고, 객체 생성 시 발생할 수 있는 오류를 줄일 수 있으며, 값 타입에 대한 유효성 검사와 관리도 일관되게 할 수 있습니다.\n여러분도 코틀린을 사용할 때, 이러한 안전한 객체 생성 방식과 값 타입 관리를 적용해보세요! 필요에 따라 객체의 생성 로직을 유연하고 안전하게 제어할 수 있을 것입니다.",

CompositionLocalProvider을 좀 더 살펴보자.\n본문을 통해 하나씩 이야기해 보겠다.\nGetStream SDK 알아보기 - 링크\n읽기 전에\nXML Theme는 다루지 않는다.\nCompose component에 대해 설명하지 않는다.\nMaterial 3에서 사용하는 Token 방식의 Color 지정을 논하진 않는다.\nGetStream 후원으로 작성한 글이다.\n\nCompose에서 Theme가 필요할까?\nAndroid에서 Theme가 필요할까? XML을 다룰 때는 특별히 테마를 신경 쓰지 않고, 필요할 때(투명, 바텀, alert 등) 사용하고, XML 코드에 대부분 색상을 직접 지정하였다.\nCompose에서도 Theme 없이 만들 수 있지 않을까? Compose Theme가 필요한지 먼저 따져보기 전에 Android Studio에서 제공하는 기본 코드를 살펴보자.\nEmpty Activity 프로젝트를 생성하면 바로 확인할 수 있는 코드로, Material 3 기반 코드로 작성되어 있다.\nsetContent부터 MyApplicationTheme, Compose Component 조합으로 화면을 그리고 있다.\n\nclass MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        enableEdgeToEdge()\n        setContent {\n            MyApplicationTheme {\n                Scaffold(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) { innerPadding ->\n                    Greeting(\n                        name = \"Android\",\n                        modifier = Modifier.padding(innerPadding)\n                    )\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n기본 코드에서도 알 수 있지만 MyApplicationTheme {}이 시작 부분에 적용됨을 알 수 있다.\n여기서 고민해 볼 수 있는데 Theme {} 시작 부분을 꼭 가져야 할까?\n답은, 없는것보단 적용하는 것이 좋으며, Material을 따르지 않더라도 CustomTheme를 가지는 것이 좋다.\n우선 Theme가 없다면 아래와 같이 직접 코드 작성 시 Color와 TextStyle을 일일이 지정해야 한다.\n\nText(\n    text = \"Hello $name!\",\n    color = Color.Blue,\n    modifier = modifier\n)\n\n\n한두 줄이라면 크게 상관없겠지만 Theme라는 틀을 활용하면 요구사항을 빠르고, 유연하게 적용할 수 있다.\n없는 것보단 있는 것이 당연하지만 좋다.(Material을 따르지 않고 CustomTheme 사용하는 것은 또 다른 이야기가 된다.)\n\n구글에서 제공하는 Material 3를 사용하지 않는다면?\nTheme를 가지는 것은 당연하지만 좋은 선택이다. 하지만 Material 3을 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\n우선 Compose Material 3 라이브러리에는 아래와 같이 3개의 디펜던시를 필요로 한다.\nandroidx.compose.material3 - Material3 Theme를 포함하여 UI 요소를 포함\nandroidx.compose.foundation - UI 위에 가장 기본이 되는 Text/TextField 와 같은 부분을 적용\nandroidx.compose.ui - Compose 레이아웃을 포함한 구성\nandroidx.compose.runtime - 컴포즈의 프로그래밍 모델 및 상태 관리의 기본 구성 요소를 포함하는 핵심\n\n공식 문서 Jetpack Compose architectural layering - link 참고\n이 중 Material 3를 포함하지 않는 것을 말하거나, Material 3을 사용은 하지만 Theme는 따로 구성하는 것 역시 가능한 선택지이다.\n여기서 2가지를 이야기해 보겠다.\n\nCustom Theme를 만들면서 Material 3를 포함하지 않는다면?\n시간과 여유가 있다면 이 방식을 선택해도 무관하다. Compose 처음 나왔을 때는 Material Theme를 사용하지 않아도 된다는 이야기들이 많았었다.\n하지만 Material Theme 기반으로 제공해 주는 UI가 상당한데, 모든 Components 정보는 Material 3의 Components - 링크을 참고하길\nScaffold : TopBar, BottomBar, Content 영역을 포함하는 틀이다.\n    \n안드로이드 Compose Scaffold, TopAppBar 활용한 개발 - 링크\n안드로이드 Compose Material 2 컬러 정보를 알아보자 - 링크\nText : 기본 Material UI 가이드를 포함\nCheckbox\nRadioButton\nBottomSheet\nSnackbar\n등 이후에 새로 추가되는 요소들도 여기에 모두 포함된다. Material 3를 처음부터 사용하지 않고 만들겠다면 이와 동일한 코드를 직접 작성하겠다는 의미이거나, 내부 코드를 복사해서 우리만의 Theme를 만들겠다는 의미이다.\n이걸 정말 하는 것이 맞을까는 다른 이야기다. 이 모든 걸 다 직접 만들고 관리할 수 있는가?\n어차피 선택은 팀과 개인의 자유이지만 Color 정도의 Custom만으로도 충분히 좋은 코드를 만들 수 있다는 점에서는 이 방식이 좋은 선택지인지는 모르겠다.\n\nCustom Theme를 만들면서 Material 3를 포함한다면?\n필자는 이 방식으로 내부에서 사용할 Components를 재정의하여 사용하고 있고, Theme 역시 Material 3를 따르도록 설계해두었다.\n2년 전만 해도 이렇게 문서에 이 색상이 어디에서 적용되는지 알지 못하였지만 이젠 문서만 잘 보아도 이 색상을 어디에서 사용할 수 있는지 알 수 있다.\n\n이걸 기반으로 Custom Theme를 내부에 정의하여 사용하고 있는데 아래와 같은 형태다.\n\nobject SomeColor {\n\n    @Stable\n    val Color = Color(0xFF000000)\n}\n\n@Immutable\ndata class SomeColorScheme(\n    val primary: Color,\n    //...

Theme를 만드는 데 있어서 Color가 어느 지점에 적절하게 사용되어야 하는지를 알아야 하는데, 위에서도 언급했지만 다행히 구글이 문서를 갱신해 주었고, 적절한 위치의 색상 사용을 알 수 있다는 것이다.\nMaterial 3 Theme - 링크에서 Components를 확인.\n적용할 수 있는 Color set은 아래와 같은데 이 값들만 36가지 종류를 가진다는 점이다. 이 값을 모두 매핑해서 사용하기엔 부담이 크다.\n여담이지만 필자는 구글이 문서를 업데이트하기 전 이미 이 작업을 하였는데, 색상이 어디에서 사용되는지 일일이 다 찾아서 사용하였는데 이와 관련한 글을 남겼었다.\n안드로이드 Compose Material 2 컬러 정보를 알아보자 - 링크\n이 중에 중요하다고 생각 드는 부분만 몇 가지 남기면?\n이 부분은 GPT를 통한 번역\nprimary: 앱의 화면과 구성 요소에서 가장 자주 표시되는 주요 색상이다.\nonPrimary: 주요 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nsecondary: 보조 색상은 제품을 강조하고 구별하는 더 많은 방법을 제공합니다. 보조 색상은 다음에 가장 적합하다\nonSecondary: 보조 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\ntertiary: 주요 색상과 보조 색상의 균형을 맞추거나 입력 필드와 같은 요소에 더 높은 주의를 끌기 위해 사용할 수 있는 제3의 색상이다.\nonTertiary: 제3의 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nbackground: 스크롤 가능한 콘텐츠 뒤에 나타나는 배경색이다.\nonBackground: 배경색 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nsurface: 카드, 시트, 메뉴와 같은 구성 요소의 표면에 영향을 미치는 표면 색상이다.\nonSurface: 표면 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\nerror: 오류 색상은 텍스트 필드의 잘못된 텍스트와 같이 구성 요소의 오류를 나타내는 데 사용한다.\nonError: 오류 색상 위에 표시되는 텍스트와 아이콘에 사용되는 색상이다.\n그래도 이만큼이다. 다행히 내부적으로 머트리얼 2에서 이상하게 사용하던 코드도 제거되어서 머트리얼 3는 그나마 괜찮아졌다는 점이다.\n이 코드를 기반으로 ColorScheme을 정의하고, 이를 Theme에 주입해 주는 역할을 하면 되는데, 기본으로 생성해 준 코드에서는 아래와 같다.\n3가지 파라메터로 Dark theme 여부, dynamicColor 여부, 마지막 람다 표현으로 content 시작점을 사용할 수 있는데, 결국 MaterialTheme에 colorScheme, typography, content를 지정하여 사용하게 된다는 점이다.\n\n@Composable\nfun MyApplicationTheme(\n    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(),\n    // Dynamic color is available on Android 12+\n    dynamicColor: Boolean = true,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    val colorScheme = when {\n        dynamicColor && Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S -> {\n            val context = LocalContext.current\n            if (darkTheme) dynamicDarkColorScheme(context) else dynamicLightColorScheme(context)\n        }\n\n        darkTheme -> DarkColorScheme\n        else -> LightColorScheme\n    }\n\n    MaterialTheme(\n        colorScheme = colorScheme,\n        typography = Typography,\n        content = content\n    )\n}\n\n\n이렇게 MaterialTheme를 사용하여 지정한 코드에서 특정 컬러를 적용하고 싶다면 MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary로 호출하여 사용한다.\n이 부분이 이미 적용되어 있는 Scaffold는 아래와 같이 사용하기만 해도 기본 또는 dynamicColor에 따라 색상이 적용된다.\n\n@Composable\nfun Screen() {\n    Scaffold {\n        Box(modifier = Modifier.padding(it)) {}\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nMaterialTheme에는 어떤 걸 포함하고 있을까?\nGetStream의 코드를 보기 전에 MaterialTheme에는 어떤 걸 외부로 제공하고 있는지 살펴보고 넘어가 보자.\ncolorScheme : 현재 테마의 색상 정보를 가져올 수 있으며 MaterialTheme.colorScheme.xxx으로 불러서 사용\ntypography : 현재 테마의 폰트 정보를 가지며 MaterialTheme.typography.xxx로 불러서 사용\nshapes : 현재 테마의 shapes 정보를 가지며 MaterialTheme.shapes.xxx로 불러서 사용\n\nobject MaterialTheme {\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [ColorScheme] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val colorScheme: ColorScheme\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalColorScheme.current\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [Typography] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val typography: Typography\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalTypography.current\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current [Shapes] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    val shapes: Shapes\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalShapes.current\n}\n\n\n이와 같이 Material Theme를 지정해두고 사용할 수 있다. 내부적으로 SomeTheme를 사용한다면 이와 같은 클래스를 직접 만들어 활용하게 되는 것이다.\n\nGetStream Theme 알아보기 전에\nMaterial 3의 Theme는 일반적인 앱에서 활용할 수 있는 정도의 가장 기본 가이드를 제공해 준다. 반면 GetStream - 링크 APIs and SDKs to Build In-App Chat & Video & Feeds Faster.에서 사용하기 위한 SDK 용도로 확장해 사용하고 있다.\nMaterial 3의 Theme 샘플을 통해서도 확장 가능하지만 SDK에서 활용될 수 있는 점을 적절하게 이용하면 Theme 사용을 좀 더 넓은 의미로 확장해 사용할 수 있음을 알 수 있으니 Theme를 사용하는 방식을 알아보자.\n\nGetStream에서 사용하는 Theme\n기본 Theme를 내부적으로 사용할 수 있도록 SomeTheme를 만들어 사용할 수 있음을 확인하였다. 그럼 GetStream에서 제공하는 Theme는 어디까지 제공하고 있을까?\nGetStream의 코드를 보기 전에 문서를 먼저 살펴보았다.\nGetStream ChartTheme에서의 Custom 제공 정보 - 링크\n이 문서에는 생각보다 Theme를 더 넓은 의미로 활용하고 있음을 알 수 있는데, 아래와 같이 나열해 보았다.\n기본 정보\n    \nGet Stream chart 관련 기본 설정\ntest 관련 옵션 제공\n권한과 관련\n    \nAudio/Video를 활용하기 위한 권한 처리\n파일 첨부 처리를 도와주는 제어, 팩토리, 권한 관련\nTheme와 관련\n    \nTheme에 대한 상세정보, 화면별로 필요한 Theme 정보, font 정보\n기타\n    \nStream MediaRecorder\nDateFormatter\n\n코드를 살펴보자\nGetStream ChartTheme에서의 Custom 제공 정보 - 링크\n이 코드는 GetStream ChatTheme.kt - 링크의 코드 중 일부를 적은 부분인데, SDK로서의 역할을 할 수 있는 모든 부분을 담고 있다고 보아도 좋을 것 같다.\nSDK라면 지정해 준 정보를 내부에서 바꾸지 않고 그대로 활용함을 보장해야 하며\n외부에서 주입해 주는 커스텀 역시 충분히 제공하는 것이 좋다.\n라는 관점으로 보면 이 GetStream의 SDK로써는 충분히 유용하게 작성되었다는 점이다.\n문맥상 매우 길어져서 몇 가지 정보만 가져와보았으니 참고해 보면 좋을 듯하다.\n\n@Composable\npublic fun ChatTheme(\n    /* 생략 */\n    autoTranslationEnabled: Boolean = false, // 각종 옵션들\n    /* 생략 */\n    colors: StreamColors = if (isInDarkMode) StreamColors.defaultDarkColors() else StreamColors.defaultColors(), // color 정의\n    /* 생략 */\n    rippleTheme: RippleTheme = StreamRippleTheme, // Ripple 정의\n    attachmentFactories: List<AttachmentFactory> = StreamAttachmentFactories.defaultFactories(), // 파일 첨부 정보\n    /* 생략 */\n    allowUIAutomationTest: Boolean = false, // 테스트 관련\n    dateFormatter: DateFormatter = DateFormatter.from(LocalContext.current), // 채팅에 사용할 date formatter\n    /* 생략 */\n    messagePreviewFormatter: MessagePreviewFormatter = MessagePreviewFormatter.defaultFormatter(\n        context = LocalContext.current,\n        typography = typography,\n        attachmentFactories = attachmentFactories,\n        autoTranslationEnabled = autoTranslationEnabled,\n    ),\n    /* 생략 */\n    attachmentsPickerTabFactories: List<AttachmentsPickerTabFactory> =\n        if (useDefaultSystemMediaPicker) {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactoriesWithoutStoragePermissions()\n        } else {\n            AttachmentsPickerTabFactories.defaultFactories()\n        },\n    /* Theme 관련 생략 */\n    streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder = DefaultStreamMediaRecorder(LocalContext.current),\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit,\n)\n\n\n\n함수 안에도 조금 살펴보자.\nChatTheme의 코드 중에 눈에 띄는 코드는 allowUIAutomationTest 옵션을 별도로 제공한다는 점이다.\nallowUIAutomationTest - true/false를 제공함으로써 semantics를 활용한 UI Test 대응을 미리 해두었다는 점이다. 컴포즈에서 Ui test를 아직 시도하지는 않아서 자세한 내용은 문서를 참고해 보시길\nsemantics - 링크\n그 외에는 LocalXXX로 시작하는 코드들이 상당히 많이 보인다. LocalXXX 부분의 코드가 많이 보인다는 건 이 부분을 살펴보는 것이 도움이 될 수 있다는 점이다.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColors provides colors,\n        /* 생략 */\n        LocalComposerLinkPreviewEnabled provides isComposerLinkPreviewEnabled,\n) {\n    if (allowUIAutomationTest) {\n            Box(\n                modifier = Modifier.semantics { testTagsAsResourceId = allowUIAutomationTest },\n            ) {\n                content()\n            }\n        } else {\n            content()\n        }\n}\n\n\n\nGetStream의 CompositionLocalProvider 적용 부분은?\nStream에서 사용하는 CompositionLocalProvider는 모두 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다는 점이다.\n사실 Theme의 시작점이고 값의 변경은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 UI가 다시 그려짐을 보장하여도 될 것 같은데, compositionLocalOf을 사용하고 있다는 점이다.\n\nprivate val LocalColors = compositionLocalOf<StreamColors> {\n    error(\"No colors provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\nprivate val LocalDimens = compositionLocalOf<StreamDimens> {\n    error(\"No dimens provided! Make sure to wrap all usages of Stream components in a ChatTheme.\")\n}\n\n\n그리고 또 하나 중요한 포인트는 private으로 Theme 이외에서는 이 값들을 업데이트하지 않음을 보장해 주고 있다.\n구글의 대표적인 Color 처리하는 코드는 아래와 같은데, Stream에서는 이 부분을 모두 private으로 적용한 부분을 그대로 활용할 수 있음을 보장한다.\n\nval LocalContentColor = compositionLocalOf { Color.Black }\n\n\nLocalContentColor는 언제 어디서든 값을 변경하고 업데이트할 수 있다.\n\nGetStream은 Theme에서 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용하여 값을 부르는 건 알겠는데?\nTheme의 범위를 어디까지 잡아야 할까? Stream의 코드 아랫 부분에 외부에서 사용할 수 있는 값들을 매핑하였는데 아래와 같다.\n\npublic object ChatTheme {\n    public val colors: StreamColors\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalColors.current\n\n    /* 생략 */\n\n    /**\n     * Retrieves the current list of [StreamMediaRecorder] at the call site's position in the hierarchy.\n     */\n    public val streamMediaRecorder: StreamMediaRecorder\n        @Composable\n        @ReadOnlyComposable\n        get() = LocalStreamMediaRecorder.current\n}\n\n\n모든 정보는 ChatTheme.colors.xxx로 부르거나 ChatTheme.streamMediaRecorder.xxxx로 바로 활용할 수 있다는 점이다.\n그런데 Theme인데 streamMediaRecorder를 바로 불러다 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\n개인적으론 SDK라서 이를 활용하는 방식도 좋은 방법이라고 생각한다. 결국 CompositionLocalProvider를 통해 사용 범위를 명확히 지정하여 사용하고 있고, 이 값들은 초기에 지정해 준 정보를 그대로 사용하고 있음을 명시적으로 작성해두었기 때문에 특별히 문제는 없는 듯하다.\n하지만 일반적인 서비스에서 이렇게까지 하는 게 맞을까는 고민이 필요한 점이다.\n\nSomeTheme.triggerEvent.xxxx // 이렇게 사용하는 것이 맞을까?\nLocalTriggerEvent.current.xxxx // 이렇게 활용하는 것이 더 좋을까?\n\n\n\nCompositionLocalProvider를 좀 더 알아보자.\nCompositionLocalProvider을 깊이 있게 탐구하는 것은 아니지만 문서에 나와있는 내용을 좀 더 알아보고 넘어가자.\n\n결국 Theme는 CompositionLocalProvider를 활용한다.\nCompositionLocalProvider를 이용해 필요한 정보를 라이프 사이클에 맞게 불러다 활용할 수 있는데, Material 3 Theme 내부도 Stream에서의 코드와 마찬가지로 적용하고 있다.\nMaterialTheme는 크게 ColorScheme, Shapes, Typography를 주입받고, 내부에서 필요한 정보를 추가로 Provider에 셋하고 있다.\n\n@Composable\nfun MaterialTheme(\n    colorScheme: ColorScheme = MaterialTheme.colorScheme,\n    shapes: Shapes = MaterialTheme.shapes,\n    typography: Typography = MaterialTheme.typography,\n    content: @Composable () -> Unit\n) {\n    val rippleIndication = androidx.compose.material.ripple.rememberRipple()\n    val selectionColors = rememberTextSelectionColors(colorScheme)\n    CompositionLocalProvider(\n        LocalColorScheme provides colorScheme,\n        LocalIndication provides rippleIndication,\n        androidx.compose.material.ripple.LocalRippleTheme provides MaterialRippleTheme,\n        LocalShapes provides shapes,\n        LocalTextSelectionColors provides selectionColors,\n        LocalTypography provides typography,\n    ) {\n        ProvideTextStyle(value = typography.bodyLarge, content = content)\n    }\n}\n\n\n이 중 colorScheme은 staticCompositionLocalOf을 사용하여 초기화하고 있고,\n\ninternal val LocalColorScheme = staticCompositionLocalOf { lightColorScheme() }\n\n\nselectionColors은 compositionLocalOf을 활용하고 있다.\n\nval LocalTextSelectionColors = compositionLocalOf { DefaultTextSelectionColors }\n\n\n결국 이 둘을 잘 알면 유용하게 사용할 수 있다는 의미이니 문서를 참고해 보자.\n\nCompositionLocalProvider란?\nLocally scoped data with CompositionLocal - 링크이란 공식 문서이다.\ncompostionLocalProvider에는 2개의 초기화 방법을 제공한다.\ncompositionLocalOf : 현재 범위 내에 compositionLocal의 정보가 변경되었을 경우 해당 범위 내의 이 값을 사용하는 범위를 갱신\n    \nContentColor를 범위 내에서 color 변경한다면 이 색상을 호출하여 사용하는 곳을 추적하여 UI를 갱신\nstaticCompositionLocalOf : 이 값은 범위 내의 값을 추적하지 않고 그냥 전부 새로 그림.\n    \nContentColor를 이 값으로 활용할 경우 화면을 전부 새로 그림\n이 두 함수의 영향 범위는 매우 다름을 알 수 있다.\n이전에 작성한 Compose에서 웹뷰를 유지하는 방법에서는 staticCompositionLocalOf 활용하는 방법을 소개했었으니 참고해 보셔도 좋다.\nCompose Navigation - WebView Recomposition 해결? - 링크\nstaticCompositionLocalOf은 값이 명확하게 1회 초기화하며 이후에는 변경하지 않음을 명시할 경우 활용하는 것이 좋고, compositionLocalOf는 언제든 변경되고, 이 값이 변경되었을 경우 값을 사용한 부분도 UI 갱신이 일어나야 하는 경우 이를 활용하는 것이 좋다.\n이 내용을 깊이 있게 알고 싶다면 Jetpack Compose Internals의 4장 Compose UI, 측정 정책 (Measuring policies) 부분에서 매우 상세하게 다루고 있으니 책을 참고하여 추가 학습하시길\nJetpack Compose Internals 한국어 번역(번역 엄재웅, 류기민) - 링크\n\n마무리\n이 글은 GetStream의 후원을 받아 작성하였다. GetStream의 내부 Theme 활용을 글로 담았는데, SDK를 만든다면 이런 형태로의 Theme를 활용할 수 있구나를 파악할 수 있었다.\n거기에 결국 Theme 값을 유지하면서 상태를 보장해 주는 방식을 private으로 잘 구분하여 사용해야 하며, Theme를 통해 더 많은 값을 불러다 활용할 수 있도록 만들어주는 것 역시 가능함을 알 수 있었다.\n이런 방식에서는 사실 호불호가 생길 수 있긴 하다.\nTheme인데 왜 Theme와 관련 없는 설정 정보를 포함하는 것인가?\n초기화만 하고, Theme가 아닌 접근 방법을 제공하면 더 좋은 거 아닐까?\n이 부분은 코드 컨벤션과 관련이 있지 않을까 싶다. SomeTheme.value.xxxx를 사용하였을 때 LocalXXX.current를 기억하고 사용하는 행위를 반대로 줄일 수 있으니 말이다.\n이 글로 Theme를 구성하는 전반적인 방법이나 CompositionLocal 사용을 다 알 수 있는 것은 아니지만 Theme를 이렇게까지 활용하고 접근 제어를 어떻게 하는 것이 좋을지만 이해해도 다행이라고 생각한다.\nMaterial 3에서 사용하는 Token 방식의 Color 지정을 논하진 않았는데 이 방식은 figma와 밀접한 관련이 있다고 하니 아래 링크를 참고하시길\nm3 Design tokens - 링크\nGetStream SDK 알아보기 - 링크",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "영어에서 많이 사용하는 문장 중 “You are in good hands”라는 말이 있다. 말 그대로 믿을만한 손이 나를 잘 잡고 있으니 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 된다는 의미다. 다양한 상황에서 이 말을 하는데, 비즈니스 상황 외에 내가 가장 많이 이 말을 들었던 건 미국 영화나 드라마에서 주인공이 적진에 침투해서 인질을 구출하면서 안심시키는 장면이 아닐까 싶다. 나도 영어로 대화할 땐 이 말을 꽤 자주 사용하는데, 투자자로서 내가 우리 투자사 대표님들에게 주로 하는 말이다.\n스트롱이 첫 번째 기관 투자를 했다면, 이 스타트업의 대표에게 “우리가 한국에서 투자를 제일 잘하는 VC도 아니고, 우리한테 투자를 받으면 회사가 꼭 성공하는 것도 아니지만, 그래도 you are in good hands 입니다. 저희는 회사들이 힘들 때 뒤에서 같이 고민하고 같이 궂은일을 할 준비가 되어 있는 투자자예요.”라는 말을 자주 한다. 우리 투자사 중 80% 이상이 우리가 첫 번째 기관투자를 했으니, 대부분의 대표님들에게 이런 말을 한다고 봐도 된다.\n솔직히 한국어로 “우리랑 같이 하니까 앞으론 걱정하지 말고 안심해도 됩니다.”라고 말하는 거랑 영어로 “You are in good hands”라고 하는 거랑 느낌이나 어감이 많이 다르긴 하다. 영어로 하는 게 임팩트가 훨씬 더 크긴 한데, 어쨌든 이 말은 내가 투자자로서 창업가들에게 자주 하는 말이다.\n그런데 얼마 전에 이 반대의 상황을 경험했다. 우리가 여러 번 투자한 스타트업의 대표가 나한테 “You are in good hands.”라고 했는데, 이 말을 듣고 뭔가 기분이 묘하긴 했다. 기분이 묘했다는 게 나빴다는 건 전혀 아니고, 오히려 그 반대였다. 내가 항상 불안해하는 창업가분들에게 이 말을 하면, 이분들의 표정이 조금은 더 편해지고, 심적으로 안정감을 찾는 것 같았는데, 나도 그런 느낌이 들었다고나 할까? “아, 이 말을 들으니, 이런 기분이 드네. 좋구먼.” 뭐, 이런 생각을 했던 것 같다.\n그 회사의 자세한 상황에 대해서 여기서 말하진 않겠다. 그런데 모든 스타트업이 그렇듯이 항상 돈은 없고, 항상 사업은 불안하고, 항상 원하는 수치는 안 나오는, 그런 전형적인 초기 스타트업이 대부분 거치는 긴 어둠의 터널을 지나는 중이었다. 우리는 사업을 직접 하는 사람은 아니지만, 이런 힘든 시기를 겪고 있는 창업가들과 워낙 많이 교류하다 보니, 이들과의 대화 속에서 항상 우리의 걱정과 근심이 직간접적으로 반영된다. 그날도 이야기하면서 이런 나의 우려가 표출됐던 것 같은데, 이분이 나를 똑바로 보면서, “걱정하지 마세요. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 했다. 이 말을 듣고 정말로 얼마나 안심이 되던지, 아마도 그분은 잘 모를 것이다.\n그래서 어느 순간부터 나는 우리에게 자금을 제공해 주는 해외 LP 분들이 글로벌 경기, 한국의 경기, 북한, 스트롱의 포트폴리오, 스트롱의 어려운 상황들 등에 대해서 우려를 표시하면, “Don’t worry. You are in good hands.”라는 말을 하기 시작했다. 우리의 창업가분들이 우리에게 큰 안심을 제공하듯이, 내가 하는 이 말도 우리의 LP들에게 큰 안심을 줄 수 있길 바란다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우린 지난 12년 동안 많은 회사에 투자했지만, 이 많은 포트폴리오와 같이 일하는 스트롱의 투자팀은 매우 작다. 나를 포함한 우리 투자팀의 규모는 딱 6명인데, 우리가 많이 받는 질문 중 하나가 어떻게 이렇게 작은 팀이 그렇게 많은 포트폴리오를 관리하냐 이다(실은 우리 내부에서는 “관리”라는 말보단 “지원”이라는 말을 더 많이 사용한다).\n어쨌든 우린 아주 lean 하게 일한다. 작은 팀이 엄청 많은 회사를 만나고, 현실적으로 힘들지만, 나는 욕심 같아서는 한국의 초기 스타트업을 전부 다 한 번씩은 만나보고 싶다. 요새도 우린 모두 다양한 팀을 만나고 있는데, 작은 투자팀이 많은 창업가들을 만나야 해서, 주로 첫 번째 미팅은 모두 각개전투 하고 있다. 지난 3개월 동안 나도 많은 창업가와 팀을 만났는데 이 중 어떤 창업가들과의 만남은 기억에 남아서 여기서 몇 자 적어보고 싶다.\n이 창업가가 하는 사업은 좀 뻔한 사업이었다. 아마도 웬만한 VC들은 “또 이 사업이야?”라면서 어쩌면 만나지도 않고 패스할 만한 그런 사업이었는데, 심지어 수치도 별로였다. 솔직히 나도 그냥 자료만 보고 안 만날까 하다가, 그래도 팀은 젊고 똑똑한 것 같아서 한 시간 정도는 이야기해 봐야겠다는 생각으로 만났는데, 역시 사업이라고 하기엔 제품도 없고, 수치는 전혀 없고, 전략도 특별하진 않았던 것 같다.\n하지만, 이 창업가는 정말 모든 걸 다 갈아 넣으면서 나에게 적극적으로 어필했다. 최근에 이렇게 열심히 본인의 사업을 나에게 설명했던 창업가가 있었느냐는 생각이 들 정도로. 그래서 미팅의 시작은 그냥 밋밋했지만, 이분과 이야기를 하면서 점점 더 집중하게 됐고, 점점 더 빠져들게 됐다. 이미 여러 VC들에게 거절당한 경험이 있고, 이 사업 절대로 안 된다는 절망적인 이야기를 너무 많이 들었기 때문에, 이번이 마지막 피칭이라는 생각으로 땀을 뻘뻘 흘리면서 자료를 설명하고, 내가 중간에 이것저것 물어보면 혹시나 본인이 말실수할까 긴장하면서 말도 버벅거렸다. 중간마다 내가 이분을 테스트하기 위해서 조금 재수 없거나, 불편한 질문을 던졌는데, 최대한 화를 안 내면서 논리적으로 설명하려고 하는 노력과 흔적들 또한 여기저기서 볼 수 있었다.\n내가 제품 데모를 보여달라고 하니, 이미 만들어 놓은 10개 이상의 데모 계정 중 하나를 선택해서 열심히 불완전한 제품의 데모를 보여줬다. 이때, 오래전 내가 뮤직쉐이크 하면서 VC들에게 피칭했던 그 모습이 이 창업가에게서 보였다. 그리고 마치 내가 이분에게 빙의?가 된 것처럼 몇 초 동안 2008년~2012년으로 돌아갔었다.\n우린 누구나 음악을 만들 수 있는 소프트웨어와 남이 만든 음악을 소비할 수 있는 작은 플랫폼/커뮤니티를 제공했는데, 음악 관련 사업이다 보니, VC들에게 반드시 고품질의 음악을 들려줘야 했다. 그래서 나는 투자자를 만날 때는 항상 노트북과 최신형 BOSE 휴대용 스피커를 갖고 다녔고, 방금 언급했던 창업가처럼 여러 개의 계정을 미리 파놓고, 각 계정에 다양한 시나리오를 이미 심어놓은 후에 상황에 맞춰서 제품 데모를 했다. 그런데 정말 데모 귀신이라는 게 존재하는지, 중요한 VC와 결정적인 미팅에서 멋진 데모를 보여주고 싶을 땐 매번 노트북이 버벅거리고, 중요한 기능이 작동하지 않아서, 나도 당황하고, 말도 제대로 못 하고, 땀을 뻘뻘 흘린 적이 한두 번이 아니었다.\n최근 했던 몇 미팅에서 만난 창업가들을 보면서 이런 오래전의 내 모습이 떠올랐고, 그때의 절박했던 상황과 생각들이 주마등같이 스쳐 지나갔다. 당시에 나는 꼭 투자받고 싶었던 VC가 몇 군데 있었는데, 결국 이들 그 누구에게도 투자를 못 받았다. 당시 나는 창업가의 위치에서 속으로는 “제발 이 투자자는 나 같은 보석을 알아보고, 우리 사업의 가능성을 알아봐 줬으면 너무너무 좋겠다.”라는 절박한 마음으로 열심히, 최선을 다해서, 미친놈처럼 피칭했었는데, 그걸 바로 내 앞의 창업가가 나한테 하고 있었던 것이다.\n내 앞의 창업가에게 우리가 투자할지 안 할지 잘 모르겠지만, 이런 생각을 하면 언제나 마음을 열어두고, 가능성을 열어두고 싶다. 이분의 사업이 아무리 봐도 망할 것 같아도, 이 창업가의 한 시간이 헛되지 않게 최선을 다해서 듣고, 보고, 물어보고, 공부해야겠다는 다짐을 다시 했다. 이 창업가의 눈에서 보이는 절박감과 초롱초롱함은 내가 오래전에 VC들에게 피칭할 때 수없이 어필하고 강조했지만, 그들이 무시하고 놓친 중요한 것들이니까.",

(1) 기업과 같은 생산자가 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우, (2) 소비자가 상품을 사용함으로써 탄소 배출량을 줄이는 경우입니다.\n예를 들어, 기업이 공정을 개선해 고효율 냉장고를 생산했다면 생산 과정에서 탄소 발자국을 감축했다 = 즉, 탄소 손자국을 늘렸다 볼 수 있는 것이고요. 소비자가 냉장고 사용 과정에서 전력 소비를 절감하기 위해 노력했다면 또 한 번 탄소 손자국을 확보한 것입니다.\n이처럼 저탄소 제품을 생산하고 사용하는 과정에서 줄인 온실가스 배출량은 해당 제품을 제공한 기업의 성과로 인정되며, 친환경 이미지를 강화하는 데에 기여할 수 있습니다.\n\n\n.css-2yhypk{white-space:pre-wrap;cursor:pointer;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);font-style:italic;-webkit-text-decoration:underline!important;text-decoration:underline!important;}\"극적으로 탄소배출량 줄인 이 남자가 소·양 대신 먹은 것“\n(한겨례 21 2024.8.17)\n1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서가 나온 이후, 개별적으로 실험하는 시민들이 등장했다. 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는 2019년 보고서를 바탕으로 1년간 1t의 탄소만을 배출하는 삶을 시도했다. 처음엔 2050년 목표치인 0.7t에 도전했지만, 현재의 인프라로는 불가능하다고 판단해 1t으로 목표치를 바꾸고 성공했다. 올터는 리드헤드로부터 실험에 관한 이야기를 직접 듣고 실험에 참여하기로 결심했다. “사실 연간 1t은 불가능하다고 생각했어요. 연구소에서 제시한 (2030년 목표인) 2.5t을 목표로 해보기로 했죠.”\n연간 2.5t이라는 배출량도 하루로 치면 약 6.8㎏이다. 붉은 육류 위주의 한 끼 식사에서 배출되는 탄소가 약 7.7㎏ 정도이니, 연 배출 2.5t을 달성하기 위해선 먹거리부터 이동, 소비 등 삶의 전반적인 방식을 바꿔야 했다. 어떻게 가능했을까. 그의 첫 번째 전략은 교통수단의 변화였다. “북미 지역에서 발생하는 탄소배출량의 가장 큰 부분이 자동차입니다. 저는 1년 동안 운전을 완전히 포기했어요.”\n캐나다의 1명당 평균 탄소배출량 구성을 보면 교통이 35%로 가장 많다. 14.2t 중에 5t이 교통에서 배출된다. 올터가 운전을 포기할 수 있었던 이유는 부동산 개발업을 그만두고 환경 관련 웹사이트에 글을 올리는 작가 일을 시작했기 때문이다.\n“저는 운이 좋은 편이었어요. 집에서 일할 수 있었고 아이들도 근처에 있었고요. 제가 사는 도시는 쇼핑도 대부분 도보나 자전거로 할 수 있었어요. 또 대학에 강의를 나갈 때도 자전거를 타고 다닐 수 있었습니다.” 1년 동안 한 번 미국 뉴욕에 다녀온 것 외에는 비행기도 타지 않았다. 식단도 바꿨다. “고기를 포기하는 것은 어렵지만 소나 양을 포기하고 탄소 배출이 훨씬 적은 돼지와 닭만 먹는 것은 그리 어렵지 않았어요. 문제가 되는 건 소나 양과 같은 반추동물이죠.”(중략)\n\n\n전 세계적으로 기후변화에 대응하기 위한 목표는 ‘온실가스 배출을 크게 줄이는 것’입니다. ‘기후변화에 관한 정부간 협의체(IPCC)’는 지구의 온도를 1.5도 이하로 유지하기 위해서는, 개인이 3.4톤 이하의 탄소만 배출해야 한다고 발표했는데요. 이는 전체 온실가스 배출량을 인구 수로 나눈 단순 결과값이었습니다.\n하지만 2019년에 발표된 일본과 핀란드의 '1.5도 라이프스타일 보고서'는 더욱 현실적인 접근을 제안합니다. 각 개인의 생활 방식을 기준으로 탄소 배출을 분석한 것인데요. 보고서에 따르면, 전체 탄소 배출량의 72%가 가정에서의 소비와 관련 있으니 개인이 연간 2.5톤의 탄소만 배출하도록 더 노력해야 한다고 합니다. 더 나아가 2040년에는 1.4톤, 2050년에는 0.7톤까지 줄여야 한다고 했고요.\n기사에 나온 영국의 환경운동가 로절린드 리드헤드는, 실제로 이 보고서에서 제안하는 방향으로 1년간 1톤의 탄소만 배출하는 삶에 도전했습니다. 기사의 또다른 주인공 로이드 올터도 2.5톤 이내로 탄소배출량을 줄이기 위해 이전과 완전히 다른 라이프스타일을 택했고요.\n그렇다면 개인이 배출하는 탄소 양을 줄이기 위해, 우리는 실생활에서 어떤 방법들을 실천해볼 수 있을까요?\n.css-uswsmm{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-flex:none;-ms-flex:none;flex:none;margin:24px

바꾸기: 자동차 운전을 줄이고, 걷기, 자전거 타기, 대중교통 이용하기 등의 습관을 만들어 보세요. 특히 출퇴근할 때 자전거와 대중교통을 사용하면, 자연스럽게 운동이 되기 때문에 건강에도 좋습니다.\n식단 조절: 사육 과정에서 많은 탄소를 배출하는 소와 양 같은 붉은 고기 대신, 돼지나 닭 같이 탄소 배출이 적은 고기를 선택해 보세요. 더 나아가 채식 위주의 식사를 시도하는 것도 좋은 방법입니다.\n소비 습관 바꾸기: 전자제품과 의류 등의 제품을 최대한 오래 사용하고, 새로운 제품을 자주 구매하지 않도록 해요. 하나의 제품을 오래 사용하는 습관을 길러보는 것은 탄소 배출을 줄이는 데 큰 도움이 되겠죠.\n도시 환경 활용: 가까운 곳은 도보로 다니거나 자전거를 활용하는 등, 도시의 친환경적인 구조를 최대한 활용해 봅시다. 네덜란드와 같이 걷기, 자전거 타기에 최적화된 도시에서는 일상생활 속에서 자연스럽게 탄소 손자국을 늘릴 수 있습니다. 이처럼 도시 내 교통수단과 도보, 자전거 사용을 통해 배출량을 줄이는 습관은 탄소 손자국을 늘리는 데 큰 도움이 됩니다.\n\n이렇게 개인의 작은 생활 습관 변화로도 탄소 손자국을 확대할 수 있답니다. 동시에 정부와 기업 역시 탄소 배출을 줄이기 위해 힘을 모아야 합니다. 정부는 탄소 배출을 줄일 수 있도록 도시 설계를 하고, 기업은 생산 과정에서 탄소 배출이 적으면서 친환경 제품을 만들기 위해 노력해야겠죠.\n탄소 손자국을 늘리는 것은 단순히 환경 보호를 위한 수단을 너머, 장기적으로 지구에서 살아가는 우리 모두가 함께 기후 변화에 대응하는 중요한 역할을 하게 될 것입니다.\n\n\n탄소 중립: 최종적으로 탄소 배출량이 ‘0’이 되도록 하는 것을 목표로 하는 개념. 배출한 만큼의 탄소를 흡수하거나 상쇄하는 방법을 함께 수행해요. 나무 심기 같은 활동이 이에 해당됩니다.\n지속 가능한 생활(Sustainable Living): 현 세대가 사용하는 자원이 미래 세대의 자원까지 고갈시키지 않도록, 환경을 생각하며 생활하는 방식. 일회용품을 줄이고 재활용하는 것, 새 제품을 계속 구입하는 것보다 하나의 제품이나 서비스를 오래도록 이용하는 것이 지속 가능한 생활을 실천하는 방법이 될 수 있겠죠.\n\n\n.css-13d8cj1{font-size:17px;line-height:1.6;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;margin:24px 0
