        "content:encodedSnippet": "C++ code navigation and build system tooling play an important role in the developer inner-loop. Code navigation tooling provides a precise, semantic understanding of your codebase, while build system tooling helps you express build configurations and variants for reproducible builds. In the VS Code ecosystem, these powerful capabilities are available through our C/C++ and CMake Tools extensions.\nWith the latest updates to GitHub Copilot in VS Code, we’re bringing the same C++-specific intelligence directly into agent mode by surfacing key language and build system capabilities as tools the agent can invoke. The goal is simple: make AI-assisted C++ workflows more consistent and performant by grounding them in the same symbol and build context developers already use and trust.\nThese tools are available through the new C/C++ DevTools extension, which ships as a part of the C/C++ extension pack for VS Code. To view the full documentation, please visit our C++ DevTools docs.\nC++ code understanding tools\nWith the new C++ code understanding tools, agent mode now has access to rich C++ symbol context. Instead of relying solely on text search or file search, the agent can now reason about C++ code at the symbol level across your workspace, which it can leverage to intelligently perform code editing operations across a codebase.\nThe current tools available for Copilot Chat include:\nGet symbol definition – Retrieve detailed information about a C++ symbol, including where it is defined and its associated metadata\nGet symbol references – Find all references to a given symbol across the codebase\nGet symbol call hierarchy – Surface incoming and outgoing calls for a function to understand call patterns and dependencies\nTo enable these tools, select the Enable Cpp Code Editing Tools setting in your VS Code user settings.\n\nExample use cases\nMemory safety\nMemory safety issues in C++ are rarely isolated to a single line of code. Safely modernizing or hardening code requires understanding where memory is allocated, who owns it, and how it flows through the system. With C++ code understanding tools, agent mode can reason about these questions using symbol-level context rather than text search alone. For example, in the following refactor, Copilot was able to quickly locate relevant symbol information and all references to the symbol to rapidly collect relevant context rather than manually searching through .cpp and .h files.\n\nDependency analysis\nBefore moving a component to a new library or changing an API surface, developers need to understand what components depend on it. Call hierarchies let Copilot analyze dependency chains and highlight potential ripple effects before changes are made. For example, Copilot is able to determine call hierarchies related to btDdvtBroadphase to determine the relevant calls to and from a given function.\n\nCMake build and test configuration tools\nIn C++ development, every change must compile, link, and pass unit tests across the project’s active build configuration, not just look correct in the editor.\nCMake build and test configuration tools leverage the build configurations identified and provided by the CMake tools extension, so Copilot Chat seamlessly builds and tests your project using the exact configuration you already have selected in VS Code. By working with the same CMake Tools integration you use in the editor, Copilot avoids relying on ad-hoc command-line invocations and stays aligned with your chosen targets, presets, and build state. This enables the agent to perform end-to-end C++ workflows greater accuracy and reliability.\nThe current tools available to Copilot Chat for build configuration include:\nBuild with CMake: Build a CMake project using active configuration\nRun CTests: Run CTest tests using active test suite\nList Build Targets: List the available set of build targets for a CMake project\nList CTest tests: List the available set of tests for a CMake project\nExample use cases\nFixing build errors\nIf a change to a codebase introduces a compiler or build error, Copilot can invoke the new CMake build tool using the active configuration, inspect the failure, and iterate on this fix until the project builds successfully with CMake.\n\nModify code to pass test suite\nWhen a change is introduced to code, Copilot can run relevant tests and adjust the code until they pass, using the same test infrastructure developers rely on manually, ensuring that the code not only builds successfully but passes the test suite.\n\nTips for best results\nBe specific: Identify the exact symbol, file, or component you’re asking about (for example, “refactor the getConfig() function” rather than “make this faster”)\nReference context: Ask Copilot Chat to consider specific files, functions, or modules when analyzing changes.\nDirectly reference tools: Directly reference relevant tools using # in chat to ensure invocation.\n\nUse custom instructions: Set up custom instructions to guide Copilot Chat.\nLeverage latest models: Use the latest AI models that support tool-calling for the most accurate code understanding and tool usage.\nOptimize tool performance: Only enable relevant tools to your development workflow to avoid context bloat.\nLet us know your feedback!\nWe’re excited to continue improving these tools and other C++ integration points based on feedback, and we encourage you to try them out and let us know how they fit into your C++ workflows. Download the C/C++ DevTools extension and give it a try. Please file any issues or feedback in the appropriate repository.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Today we are releasing the first preview of the Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools version 14.51. This update, shipping in the latest Visual Studio 2026 version 18.4 Insiders release, introduces many C++23 conformance changes, bug fixes, and runtime performance improvements. Check out the release notes for an in-progress list of what’s new. Conformance improvements and bug fixes will be detailed in an upcoming blog post and Insiders release notes in the near future.\nWe plan to ship more frequent, incremental MSVC Build Tools previews, just as we are shipping more frequent IDE updates. As a result, we have adjusted the process for enabling and using MSVC previews, and this post describes the new process.\nWe encourage you to explore MSVC previews to adapt to breaking changes and report issues early. MSVC previews do not receive servicing patches and thus should not be used in production environments.\nHow to opt in\nVisual Studio 2026 has changed the process for opting in to MSVC Build Tools previews. Most Visual Studio updates will include fresh MSVC previews, bringing compiler changes to you far faster than ever before. These updates will occur more frequently in the Insiders channel. Soon, you will also be able to install MSVC previews from the Stable channel, though these will be less recent than the builds available in Insiders.\nInstalling MSVC previews\nTo install MSVC v14.51 Preview, you must select one or both of these components in the Visual Studio installer depending on what architectures you are targeting for your builds:\nMSVC Build Tools for x64/x86 (Preview)\nMSVC Build Tools for ARM64/ARM64EC (Preview)\nYou can install these from the Workloads tab under Desktop development with C++ or from the Individual components tab.\nHow to install MSVC v14.51 Preview from the C++ desktop workload\n\nMSVC v14.51 components under “Individual components”\n\nAn easy way to find the relevant components under Individual components is to search for “preview”. Here you will also find support libraries and frameworks like MFC, ATL, C++/CLI, and Spectre-mitigated libraries compatible with this MSVC preview.\nThe components are the same as stable MSVC releases, except they are marked with “(MSVC Preview)” rather than “(Latest)” or a specific version number. Whenever you update Visual Studio, your MSVC preview will also be updated to the latest available build in that installer channel. Preview MSVC builds are not designed with version pinning in mind and do not receive servicing updates, though you can always download fresh builds as you update the IDE.\nIf you only want to build in the command line, you can also install MSVC v14.51 Preview using the Build Tools for Visual Studio 2026, by selecting the same checkboxes.\nConfiguring Command Prompts\nYou can configure MSVC Preview command-line builds by navigating to this path and running the appropriate vcvars for your desired environment:\ncmd.exe example for x64 builds:\ncd \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\18\\Insiders\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\"\r\n.\\vcvars64.bat -vcvars_ver=Preview\n\nConfiguring MSBuild Projects\nFor MSBuild projects, you must enable MSVC preview builds in the project system by setting the new Use MSVC Build Tools Preview property to “Yes” and making sure the MSVC Build Tools Version property is set to “Latest supported”. If MSVC Build Tools Version is set to something other than “Latest supported”, that MSVC version will be used for builds instead. If you wish to switch back to a stable MSVC build, you should set Use MSVC Build Tools Preview to “No”.\nInstructions – Enabling MSVC previews in MSBuild projects\nFirst, right-click the project you want to modify in Solution Explorer, select Properties.\nNext, make sure your Configuration and Platform at the top are set to what you want to modify.\nUnder the General tab (open by default), set Use MSVC Build Tools Preview to “Yes”.\n\nMake sure the MSVC Build Tools Version property is set to “Latest supported”, or else your project will build with the version specified there instead.\nLastly, run a build to make sure it works. Your project will now build using the latest preview tools.\nNote: For command-line builds, you can also set the new property by running:\nmsbuild <project_or_solution_file> /p:MSVCPreviewEnabled=true\nConfiguring CMake Projects\nFor CMake projects, you should specify the MSVC version in a CMakePresets.json file under the toolset property. The same process applies regardless of what version of MSVC you want to use (and whether it’s a Preview or not).\nInstructions – Enabling MSVC previews in CMake projects\nFirst, open your CMake project in Visual Studio. Ensure your workspace has a CMakePresets.json file in the root directory. See Configure and build with CMake Presets | Microsoft Learn if you need help configuring a CMakePresets file.\nThen, add a base preset under configurePresets that specifies MSVC v14.51:\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"windows-msvc-v1451-base\",\r\n    \"description\": \"Base preset for MSVC v14.51\",\r\n    \"hidden\": true,\r\n    \"inherits\": \"windows-base\",\r\n    \"toolset\": {\r\n        \"value\": \"v145,host=x64,version=14.51\"\r\n    }\r\n}\nNext, add more specific presets for each individual architecture, e.g.:\n{\r\n    \"name\": \"x64-debug-msvc-v1451-preview\",\r\n    \"displayName\": \"x64 Debug (MSVC v14.51 Preview)\",\r\n    \"inherits\": \"windows-msvc-v1451-base\",\r\n    \"architecture\": {\r\n        \"value\": \"x64\",\r\n        \"strategy\": \"external\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"cacheVariables\": {\r\n        \"CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\": \"Debug\"\r\n    }\r\n}\nNext, slect the new build configuration from the list of targets beside the Play button at the top of the IDE.\nLastly, run a build to make sure it works. You can create additional presets the same way for other MSVC versions to easily swap between them.\nKnown issues\nThere are several known issues that will be fixed in a future MSVC Build Tools Preview and/or Visual Studio Insiders release.\nCMake targets using Visual Studio generator\nThere is a bug configuring CMake targets using the Visual Studio (MSBuild) generator. A workaround is described below.\nFirst, open Developer Command Prompt for VS Insiders (or the prompt for the version of Visual Studio you are using) as an administrator.\nThen, run the following commands, which create a new folder and copy a file from another location to it:\npushd %VCINSTALLDIR%\\Auxiliary\\Build\r\nmkdir 14.51\r\ncopy .\\v145\\Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.VC.14.51.props .\\14.51\\Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.14.51.props\r\ncopy .\\v145\\Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.VC.14.51.txt .\\14.51\\Microsoft.VCToolsVersion.14.51.txt\nLastly, run a build to make sure it works.\nCommand-line builds using PowerShell\nCommand line builds in PowerShell (including via Launch-VsDevShell.ps1) are not yet configured for the preview.\nC++ CMake tools for Windows dependency on latest stable MSVC\nIf you are using the CMake tools in Visual Studio, their installer component still has a dependency on the latest stable version of MSVC. Therefore you will need to install both latest stable and latest preview MSVC Build Tools until we correct this dependency relationship.\nTry out MSVC v14.51 Preview in Visual Studio 2026!\nWe encourage you to try out Visual Studio 2026 version 18.4 on the Insiders Channel, along with MSVC version 14.51 Preview. For MSVC, your feedback can help us address any bugs and improve build and runtime performance. Submit feedback using the Help > Send Feedback menu from the IDE, or by navigating directly to Visual Studio Developer Community.\nThe post Microsoft C++ (MSVC) Build Tools v14.51 Preview Released: How to Opt In appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Go developers can now confidently write modern Go code using the AI agents Junie and Claude Code. We at JetBrains have just released a new plugin with guidelines for AI agents that ensure they use the latest features and follow best Go practices compatible with your current version of Go, as specified in go.mod. You can find the relevant GitHub repository at go-modern-guidelines.\nWhy do you need it?\nWith two major releases every year, Go is one of the more frequently updated languages. Yet we’ve found that all AI agents – Junie and Claude Code included – tend to generate obsolete Go code.\nThe Go team also pointed to that problem in one of their articles: “During the frenzied adoption of LLM coding assistants, we became aware that such tools tended – unsurprisingly – to produce Go code in a style similar to the mass of Go code used during training, even when there were newer, better ways to express the same idea.”\nAs an example, here’s a sample code snippet of how an agent used a manual loop to find an element in the slice:\n// HasAccess checks if the user's role has access to protected resources.\nfunc HasAccess(role string) bool {\n    for _, allowed := range allowedRoles {\n       if role == allowed {\n          return true\n       }\n    }\n    return false\n}\nThere are two main reasons why agents would favor obsolete architecture where cleaner and more idiomatic solutions are available:\nData cutoff: Even the most current AI models are trained on time-bound datasets that have a “cutoff” date (for example, for Claude Opus 4.6, that’s May 2025). They will not recognize or suggest features that were introduced after that point, such as those found in the Go 1.26 release.\nFrequency bias: AI models are primarily trained on open-source codebases that may not be readily updated. It’s natural that such datasets will feature more “old” code than “new”, and since AI models favor alternatives that are more frequent, they will suggest obsolete code as a result.\nJust like the Go team, we at GoLand, strive to keep the Go ecosystem modern and idiomatic. So to mitigate the effect of AI agents contributing to this issue, we’ve created a plugin with a set of guidelines for Junie and Claude Code, that helps them generate modern Go code. The plugin automatically recognizes the current version of your Go code (specified in go.mod) and instructs the agent to use corresponding features, such as new(val) instead of x := val; &x or errors.AsType[T](err) instead of errors.As(err, &target) (both introduced in Go 1.26), as well as stdlib additions available up to and including that version.\nHere’s the same code sample from before with our guidelines applied, where the agent actually uses the modern slices.Contains() method introduced in Go 1.21.\nvar allowedRoles = []string{\"admin\", \"moderator\", \"editor\"}\n\n// HasAccess checks if the user's role has access to protected resources.\nfunc HasAccess(role string) bool {\n\treturn slices.Contains(allowedRoles, role)\n}\nHow to enable\nIn Junie\nFor Junie version 2xx.620.xx or higher, you don’t have to do anything – these guidelines will be applied right out of the box.\nIf you’re running an older version, go to Settings → Plugins → Installed, find Junie, and then click Update.\nIf, for some reason, you want to disable these settings, you can do so in Settings → Tools → Junie → Project Settings → Go. The Provide modern Go guidelines option is enabled by default, so untick the box.\nDownload GoLand\n                                                    \nIn Claude Code\nTo use these guidelines in Claude Code, run the following commands inside a Claude Code session to install it.\nAdd this repository as a marketplace:\n/plugin marketplace add JetBrains/go-modern-guidelines\nInstall the plugin:\n/plugin install modern-go-guidelines\nTo activate it, run the following command at the start of a session:\n/use-modern-go\nClaude Code will then detect the Go version from go.mod and instruct the agent to use modern features compatible with that version.\n> /use-modern-go\n\nThis project is using Go 1.24, so I'll stick to modern Go best practices\n\nand freely use language features up to and including this version.\n\nIf you'd prefer a different target version, just let me know.\nAfter this, any Go code that the agent writes will follow the guidelines.\nHappy coding!\nThe GoLand team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Let’s call a spade a spade. Some enterprises are already using AI agents, but very few can explain their impact on business performance.\nMetrics such as DORA, SPACE, and developer experience indicators captured through third-party platforms offer insight into delivery velocity and developer quality of life, but it is still difficult to cleanly map this all the way to business impact. \nUnless you work directly on model development, model metrics themselves rarely determine whether AI is creating enterprise value. \nThe gap between technical performance signals and sustained business outcomes is an obstacle to scaling AI responsibly.\nFrom technical metrics to business value\nAbstract benchmarks such as SWE-Bench Pro and Tau2-bench are directionally useful in selecting AI tools, but can be orthogonal to how these tools perform in enterprise systems. An agent that performs well in a controlled environment can fail once integrated into production workflows. What matters is not benchmark scores, but the impactfulness, traceability, and resilience of AI systems under real-world conditions. \nRecent data underscores the urgent need to find an accurate way of measuring these variables. Though 88% of employees use AI at work today, just 5% use it “in a transformative way”, according to the EY 2025 Work Reimagined Survey.\nBlindly adopting AI is unlikely to be fruitful. Enterprises should instead experiment with and evaluate AI through operational metrics on the systems they are accountable to build and operate. The focus should be on the lifetime cost of maintaining systems, the average time humans spend over baseline, and throughput as a function of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).\nAuditability matters for tracing decisions and meeting governance needs, while human readability ensures teams can understand and manage system behavior now, and later. These are table stakes for technical teams to have in place as they adopt AI at scale.\nThe ROI problem\nEvery enterprise wants to link AI to ROI, but the data rarely aligns. The problem is not limited to model telemetry. AI is embedded into enterprise systems and assigned responsibility for specific parts of the SDLC and operational workflows.\nEvidence of its impact must therefore span system behaviour, human intervention, and downstream business KPIs. These signals live in different systems and move on different timescales, which creates a gap between AI activity and measurable business outcomes. This is why most organizations rely on proxies or assumptions rather than proof.\nClosing the gap\nThe next generation of AI orchestration platforms will need to close this gap by correlating technical performance with operational and financial signals. When those systems mature, ROI will shift from being an abstract target to a measurable outcome grounded in data.\nThe impact of this gap is already visible in enterprise outcomes. The WRITER 2025 Enterprise AI Adoption Report found that organizations without a formal AI strategy report only 37% success when adopting AI, compared with 80% for those that tie performance to clear operational outcomes. \nThe data is unambiguous. Only when an organization measures technical and operational signals together does it finally gain a true picture of AI’s value.\nTowards continuous benchmarking\nWhat underlies enterprise AI is not static. Data drifts, workflows evolve, and compliance obligations expand. Measurement must therefore become a continuous feedback loop rather than an annual report. \nThe same principle should apply across the enterprise: Performance metrics should remain stable, but they must either stay independent of changing conditions or explicitly measure those changes over time.\nMeasuring what matters\nMeaningful AI performance measurement is not about bigger numbers or more dashboards. It is about connecting operational signals with business truth. \nEnterprise leaders must grapple with model performance alongside how intelligently it scales, how transparently it operates, and how clearly its impact can be proven.\nTaking benchmark numbers at face value resembles trusting a car manufacturer’s fuel efficiency without ever driving the car to see if it holds up in real conditions. \nOnly when these can be addressed with real data will AI become a truly accountable part of the enterprise stack.\nThe real question for leaders is simple: Are you measuring the numbers that prove AI is working in practice, or just parroting back the numbers on public benchmarks?",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Learning to code in an online course can feel like hitting a wall again and again, without much help moving forward. Our research team wanted to change that. That’s why our Education Research team built an AI-powered hints tool that doesn’t just point out errors but helps students understand them. As described in our blog post last summer, students can use the tool in JetBrains Academy courses to get tailored guidance nudging them towards the solution instead of staring blankly at a stubborn piece of code or waiting for help on a forum. \nTry our plugin\n                                                    \nSince then, our researchers have investigated how students actually use the tool and published the results in a paper that they will present at the Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS) February 19 in St. Louis, Missouri. In this blog post, we will explain how the study was set up, its results, and our analysis.\nLearning to code with the help of smart feedback\nIn the last post, we covered the history of online learning and the importance of feedback in any type of learning environment. Online programming courses can differ a lot in format, especially in how they encourage students to practice writing and running code within the course. \nMany online learning platforms, such as Udemy, Codecademy, and edX, provide online editors for students to complete the exercises. Learning programming inside a code editor is easier than installing and learning new software, but in the long run it means that the student is unfamiliar with the relevant professional environment. Other platforms, such as Hyperskill, offer a hybrid option, where the student can also learn in a professional integrated developer environment (IDE) if they choose to do so. The downside of a hybrid course is that some students might not choose to use the IDE, for example if they consider it a hurdle to install and learn to navigate new software.\nFor our JetBrains Academy courses, we released the JetBrains Academy plugin a few years ago, which lets educators build complete courses directly inside the IDE. With this setup, students can read theory and immediately apply it by solving practical tasks in the very same environment they use to write code. As a result, they can become comfortable working in IDEs early on and are better prepared for real-world software development roles. \nA recent addition to our plugin is the AI-powered hints tool, developed by our   Education Research team. The tool leverages powerful IDE features by combining static analysis and code quality checks with LLMs to provide personalized hints to students. In the previous paper, we conducted evaluation studies to gauge how useful students found the tool while learning, as described in the previous blog post.\nTo help students even further, we wanted to know more about how they are really interacting with the tool and discover possible new behavior patterns. In the rest of this blog post, we will talk about exactly this: how students are actually interacting with the AI-powered hints tool.\nSmart feedback in online learning\nRecent years have seen many studies exploring how students interact with intelligent tutoring systems, offering useful directions for future system design. In this short subsection, we will provide a summary of recent studies, plus describe what our study adds to the field.\nResearchers in this study examined an intelligent next-step hint system to understand why students ask for help, looking at factors such as time elapsed and code completeness after each hint, and identifying reasons like difficulty starting an exercise. This work provides general insights into students’ hint-seeking patterns, but without the details (e.g. keystroke data). This study analyzed when and how to provide feedback and hints using keystroke datasets annotated with points where experts would intervene, but did not look at students’ actual interactions with hint systems. \nIn this paper, researchers investigated how different hint levels support task completion and why students request hints, using a think‑aloud study with pre‑ and post‑tests for 12 students. However, we would have liked to see broader usage patterns or how learners cope with unhelpful hints.\nMore recently, researchers studied how students use on-demand automated hints in an SQL course and how these hints affect learning, using A/B testing to identify behavioral differences and simple patterns. For example, they found that students often request a second hint within 10 seconds of the first one. While this research sheds light on basic behavioral trends, it mainly asks whether adding a hint system supports learning, rather than closely examining the interaction patterns themselves. \nOverall, prior work has focused on why and when hints are given, but far less on how students actually work with them in practice. In our study, we applied process mining techniques to uncover detailed behavioral patterns in how students interact with hints while they solve programming tasks. In addition, we conducted interviews with a subset of the students to learn more about how they interact with the hints tool in specific scenarios.\nOur investigation into students’ behavioral patterns\nWith our study, we wanted to better understand how the students are really interacting with the tool, as well as how students navigate situations with less helpful hints. Specifically, our two research questions were:\nWhat behavioral patterns can be identified based on students’ interaction with the next-step hint system?\nWhat strategies do students use to overcome unhelpful hints?\nOur study collected data in two steps. First, we collected information about all of the students’ interactions with the hints system, analyzing these interactions quantitatively. Then, we selected a subset of six students to interview for about 30 minutes, so that we had a qualitative and in-depth complement to the quantitative analysis. In the next subsection, we will tell you about the methodology for each step. The subsection after that will present the results and analysis.\nQuantitative behavioral analysis\nFor the first part of the study, we analyzed detailed problem-solving data from first- and second-year Bachelor’s students working on programming tasks in our introductory Kotlin course. The selected projects represent different levels of complexity and cover basic topics such as variables, loops, conditional operators, and functions. The 34 participants had previously completed at least one programming course in another language, and they had no experience with Kotlin before. We asked these students to complete three projects from the course, using the hint system whenever they wanted. \nWe used KOALA to capture keystrokes, IDE actions, the windows they accessed, and rich information about their hint usage. Hint-usage information included details like when hints were requested and for which specific tasks. The resulting dataset contains:\n6,658,936 lines of code\n1,364,943 IDE activity events\n960 textual hint requests\n453 code hint requests \nNote: This dataset is open source, and we encourage you to take a look. It can be used for further analysis in a research project, or even just for educators to see how beginner learners are programming.\nProcess mining and our dataset: Preliminaries\nAfter collecting this data, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the students’ behavior. To do this, we used a process mining technique. Process mining turns log or event data into behavioral models using action analysis, taking into account both event frequency and sequence. In business settings, the technique can help companies see where improvements are needed, as is argued for in this process mining manifesto, and save a lot of money, for example, by finding instances of duplicate payments or minimizing complex order delays.\nAlthough it is primarily used in industry settings, process mining has already been applied in educational domains (see this paper and this paper for examples). As far as we know, we are the first to use process mining to analyze programming hint systems.\nTo apply this technique to our hint-systems dataset, we first extracted all hint-request sessions from the dataset (1,050 in total). The data from these sessions are the input for the analysis, which uses specialized algorithms to map the activities and transitions between them.\nThe sessions began when a student requested a hint. By clicking Get Hint or Retry, they ended when it was clear that the hint was processed, either by accepting the code hint or closing the text hint banner. The session was also considered “over” if the student ran into an error or there was no activity for five minutes.\nWe also defined different activities within sessions. Here are the activities:\nHint Button Clicked: The student clicks Get Hint to generate a hint.\nHint Retry Clicked: The student clicks Retry to regenerate a hint.\nHint Code Generated: The code hint is generated. By tool design, this action is triggered every time Get Hint is clicked.\nHint Banner Shown: The banner with a textual hint is shown to the student. Although this action is carried out by the system, not by the student, it marks the moment when the student has viewed the hint. This action will be used for a more detailed analysis.\nShow Code Hint Clicked: The student clicks Show Code to show a code hint.\nHint Accepted: The student clicks Accept to accept a code hint.\nHint Banner Closed: The student closes the textual hint banner.\nHint Canceled: The student clicks Cancel to decline a code hint.\nError Occurred: This action includes cases where internal errors occurred during the hint generation process, e.g. problems with the internet connection, or when the LLM did not provide a response.\nAll sessions began with items 1 or 2, i.e. clicking Get Hint or Retry. A session could end with different activities, with the most common being items 6, 8, and 9: Hint Accepted, Hint Canceled, or Error Occurred. \nIn the analysis, we coded the sequence of activities within each session. We also grouped the sessions into the following three main types:\nPositive Student accepted the code hint\nNeutral Student saw a hint but didn’t clearly accept or reject it\nNegative Student canceled a hint or got an error\nThe first and last types are straightforward: For the positive type, the session ended when the student accepted the code hint. For the negative, the session ended because the student did not use the hint, having received an error or actively cancelled the hint. \nThe neutral type will be looked at in more detail in the next section, as it required additional analysis to determine how helpful the student found the hint. We know by the actions carried out that the student saw a text or code hint, but they proceeded without explicitly accepting the code hint. Examples of neutral sessions include the following (Hint Code Generated has been omitted, as it automatically occurs as the second step in each):\nHint Retry Clicked → Hint Banner Shown \nHint Button Clicked → Hint Banner Shown → Show Code Hint Clicked\nHint Retry Clicked → Hint Banner Shown → Hint Banner Closed\nThe numbers below shows the distribution of session types among the 1,050 total sessions.\nPositive: 299 (28%)\nNeutral: 420 (40%)\nNegative: 284 (27%)\n\n\n\n\nThe above shows that strictly positive sessions make up about a third of all sessions. As will be discussed below, we found out that the neutral cases often actually were successful in helping the students with their tasks, even if not positive as defined above. Namely, in these cases students clearly analyzed and used the content of the hints but did not automatically apply them.\nNote that 266 of the 284 (94%) negative sessions ended with errors, rather than the student cancelling the hint. These errors were either internet connection issues on the student side or a system issue on our side; we have already fixed any such system errors. In addition to these three types listed above, we collected 47 data points, accounting for 4,5% of the sessions, that were not classifiable based on the available data. \nWith these preliminary data about the “events”, we were able to move on to applying the process mining technique for our analysis. The next subsection describes these results. \nProcess mining and our dataset: Analysis\nWe turned the data described in the previous subsection into a map of how students moved through the system. This sort of map is also called a process behavior graph. The graph for our dataset is displayed below; as it is quite complex, we will explain the most important parts individually.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above graph, some boxes are colored, while others are not. The blue boxes at the top represent activities that begin a session, either by generating a new hint or retrying a hint; the red boxes on the left represent activities that end a negative session; the green box at the bottom is the activity that can end a positive session; and the other activities represent activities that can otherwise happen during a session. \nThe arrows indicate the direction of transitions, and the numbers next to the arrows indicate the average time in seconds for each transition. Longer times, particularly those around 900 seconds, indicate that the student was solving the task and then returned for another hint. In those cases, a new event would have been triggered.\nEach arrow’s transparency and thickness represent information about the frequency and average prevalence. As can be seen in the fragment below, the most frequent transitions occurred from the blue box Hint Button Clicked to white boxes Hint Code Generated and then to Hint Banner Shown. \n\nThe arrows that circle back to themselves, such as in the snippet below, represent those instances in which students repeatedly clicked the same button. In the case of the white box Show Code Hint Clicked, we think this suggests that the student might not have understood how the code hint worked, and that a future iteration of the tool would need to provide more explanation to help the student.\n\nLooking more closely at the negative sessions, we can see in the following image two arrows coming from the red box labelled ERR. The right arrow with an 18.7-second average leads to HRC, or Hint Retry Clicked. The left arrow with > 900 s leads to HBC, or Hint Button Clicked.\n\nThese patterns indicate that even when the student encountered an error, such as a bad internet connection, they persisted in generating a new hint, either within the same task or in another. This is an important insight because it shows that students are motivated to use the hints tool even when encountering errors or negative scenarios.\nIn the image below, we can also see that between the blue Hint Button Clicked and various white boxes, there is an arrow going back to the blue HBC button. We interpret these transitions as indicating that the students modified their code to generate additional variations of the same hint before integrating the information into a solution. That is, the pattern suggests that they did not simply click Accept Hint, but tried to solve the task themselves.\n\nIn the classification part of the analysis described in the previous subsection, these types of activities usually comprised the sessions labelled as neutral, as they often did not end with the student accepting the hint. These and other unexpected patterns were why we wanted to hear more from these students about why they behaved the way they did.\nQualitative behavioral analysis\nAs described in the previous section, we observed three types of sessions when the students interacted with the AI-powered hint system. We categorized a session as positive when the student ended the trajectory by clicking Accept Hint, as the tool is working as intended. We categorized a session as negative if the student received an error message or they themselves canceled the hint. Interestingly, the students still persevered in trying for new hints despite errors. \nFinally, we categorized sessions as neutral when the student clearly saw the hint but did not end the session like in positive or negative sessions. This means they saw the hint, but did not apply it to their code; for this reason, we do not consider these sessions negative or unsuccessful. Our analysis shows that neutral sessions make up 40% of all sessions, and we were curious about what exactly the students’ strategies were. \nIn order to learn more about what the students were thinking, we selected a subset of the participants so that they represented different experience levels, as well as locations. We conducted six semi-structured interviews, each lasting approximately 30 minutes. The interviews had two main sections: asking the participants about their experience with AI-powered hints and about any other forms of assistance they might have used while completing the tasks.\nLet’s look at what is going on in the neutral scenarios. We will focus on reporting two kinds of behaviors in these neutral scenarios: selective use of hints and combining partial solutions.\nSelective use of hints\nFrom these interviews, we learned that some participants chose to work with the code hints manually instead of clicking Accept Hint. The reasons for this depended on the situation: sometimes they chose to manually alter their code for improved learning, i.e. so that they could better remember how to fix the problem next time; sometimes they only wanted to use part of the code hint. We call this behavior selective use of hints.\nIn the log data, we could see that the students opened the visual diff window in the code editor. This window allows the student to view both their own code and the code hint. After opening this window, the students then manually typed in the recommended code from the hint – if the hint was clear. \nWe can show you two examples where the hints were unclear. In the first, the text hint suggested that an image should be trimmed before applying filters, and that this trimming could be done by storing a temporary result in a variable. This can be seen in the image below, inside the box bordered by a dotted line.\n\nAs can be seen above, the student did not completely follow the hint; instead they only trimmed the image and did not create a new variable. An advantage of the in-IDE format over a course in an online editor is that the IDE will show the student an optimized way to proceed with the removed variable, even though the hint had suggested otherwise. The student’s strategy in this example suggests that students are not unquestioningly accepting hints, but are actually analyzing and adapting them for their benefit. \nIn a second case, the text hint suggested that the student should add a Boolean variable to store the result of a game. The image below displays the hint, as well as the various student attempts, which included a few compilation errors. \n\nThe text hint was not wrong, but it did not provide the full story: in Kotlin, Boolean variables can be initialized later when used in a loop, and so it provided the code without any initial value. Based on the student’s attempts to compile, they did not understand this language-specific feature. \nFrom looking more closely at the students’ behavior concerning selective use of hints, we learned both that students are actively trying to adapt the hints so that they can learn better and that, in creating the hints, we should take into account language-specific features that a beginner student might not yet know about. Both takeaways form a solid basis for future investigations. \nCombining partial solutions\nIn the qualitative analysis of the AI-powered hints tool, we additionally learned that the students sometimes combined information from multiple hint attempts, instead of using only one hint. In the log data, this appeared as clusters of closely spaced hint requests on the same portion of code, followed by students editing the solution themselves rather than just copy-and-pasting code. This behavior is depicted schematically in the image below.\n\nThis behavior, which we call combining partial solutions, can be seen as a strategy to develop a working solution by troubleshooting and making small changes to their solutions, each time generating a new hint. As with the previous behavior, students did not accept the code hint, which is why we categorized it as a neutral and not a positive scenario. \nWithin this analysis, we found that students often toggled between their original code version and multiple hints: they kept the previous code hint windows open. We did not expect this behavior from students using the hint tool and will investigate further in future work.\nWe also observed that students sometimes copied their original code outside the task environment, reusing it later alongside new attempts. In the end, they were able to obtain a working solution with this strategy. This is another behavior that we did not expect from the students, and we are interested in investigating it further in the future. More specifically, we would like to provide the participants with multiple hints simultaneously (instead of sequentially), so that they can construct a working solution efficiently and effectively. \nFrom this analysis, we have learned that the hint tool could benefit from better support for partial adoption of hints and designs that embrace the way students naturally mix system suggestions with their own understanding and ideas, so that the student does not have to manually open multiple windows or copy-and-paste code from outside the IDE.\nFurthermore, what we can understand from this behavior of combining partial solutions is that the students are active problem solvers. That is, they are not just clicking through the hints so that they can advance to the next step or lesson. Instead, students analyze the hints and adapt them to get even a better solution – critical thinking skills like these are invaluable in the LLM era.\nExplore it yourself \nInterested in learning programming with the help of our AI-powered hints tool?

This blog post will dive deeper into what LangChain offers and guide you through a few more real-world use cases. And even if you haven’t read the first post, you might still find the info in this one helpful for building your next AI agent.\nLangChain fundamentals\nLet’s have a look at what LangChain is. LangChain provides a standard framework for building AI agents powered by LLMs, like the ones offered by OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., and is therefore the easiest way to get started. LangChain supports most of the commonly used LLMs on the market today.\nLangChain is a high-level tool built on LangGraph, which provides a low-level framework for orchestrating the agent and runtime and is suitable for more advanced users. Beginners and those who only need a simple agent build are definitely better off with LangChain.\nWe’ll start by taking a look at several important components in a LangChain agent build.\nAgents\nAgents are what we are building. They combine LLMs with tools to create systems that can reason about tasks, decide which tools to use for which steps, analyze intermittent results, and work towards solutions iteratively.\n\n\n\n\nCreating an agent is as simple as using the `create_agent` function with a few parameters:\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\n\nagent = create_agent(\n\n   \"gpt-5\",\n\n   tools=tools\n\n)\nIn this example, the LLM used is GPT-5 by OpenAI. In most cases, the provider of the LLM can be inferred. To see a list of all supported providers, head over here.\nLangChain Models: Static and Dynamic\nThere are two types of agent models that you can build: static and dynamic. Static models, as the name suggests, are straightforward and more common. The agent is configured in advance during creation and remains unchanged during execution.\nimport os\n\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\n\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\n\nmodel = init_chat_model(\"gpt-5\")\n\nprint(model.invoke(\"What is PyCharm?\"))\n\nDynamic models allow you to build an agent that can switch models during runtime based on customized logic. Different models can then be picked based on the current state and context. For example, we can use ModelFallbackMiddleware (described in the Middleware section below) to have a backup model in case the default one fails.\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\n\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import ModelFallbackMiddleware\n\nagent = create_agent(\n\n   model=\"gpt-4o\",\n\n   tools=[],\n\n   middleware=[\n\n       ModelFallbackMiddleware(\n\n           \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n\n           \"claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022\",\n\n       ),\n\n   ],\n\n)\nTools\nTools are important parts of AI agents. They make AI agents effective at carrying out tasks that involve more than just text as output, which is a fundamental difference between an agent and an LLM. Tools allow agents to interact with external systems – such as APIs, databases, or file systems. Without tools, agents would only be able to provide text output, with no way of performing actions or iteratively working their way toward a result.\nLangChain provides decorators for systematically creating tools for your agent, making the whole process more organized and easier to maintain. Here are a couple of examples:\nBasic tool\n@tool\n\ndef search_db(query: str, limit: int = 10) -> str:\n\n   \"\"\"Search the customer database for records matching the query.\n\n   \"\"\"\n\n...\n\n   return f\"Found {limit} results for '{query}'\"\nTool with a custom name\n@tool(\"pycharm_docs_search\", return_direct=False)\n\ndef pycharm_docs_search(q: str) -> str:\n\n   \"\"\"Search the local FAISS index of JetBrains PyCharm documentation and return relevant passages.\"\"\"\n\n...\n\n   docs = retriever.get_relevant_documents(q)\n\n   return format_docs(docs)\nMiddleware\nMiddleware provides ways to define the logic of your agent and customize its behavior. For example, there is middleware that can monitor the agent during runtime, assist with prompting and selecting tools, or even help with advanced use cases like guardrails, etc.\nHere are a few examples of built-in middleware. For the full list, please refer to the LangChain middleware documentation.\n\nMiddlewareDescription\nSummarizationAutomatically summarize the conversation history when approaching token limits.\nHuman-in-the-loopPause execution for human approval of tool calls.\nContext editingManage conversation context by trimming or clearing tool uses.\nPII detectionDetect and handle personally identifiable information (PII).\n\n\n\n\n\nReal-world LangChain use cases\nLangChain use cases cover a varied range of fields, with common instances including: \nAI-powered chatbots\nDocument question answering systems\nContent generation tools\nAI-powered chatbots\nWhen we think of AI agents, we often think of chatbots first. If you’ve read the How to Build Chatbots With LangChain blog post, then you’re already up to speed about this use case. If not, I highly recommend checking it out.\nDocument question answering systems\nAnother real-world use case for LangChain is a document question answering system. For example, companies often have internal documents and manuals that are rather long and unwieldy. A document question answering system provides a quick way for employees to find the info they need within the documents, without having to manually read through each one.\nTo demonstrate, we’ll create a script to index the PyCharm documentation. Then we’ll create an AI agent that can answer questions based on the documents we indexed. First let’s take a look at our tool:\n@tool(\"pycharm_docs_search\")\n\ndef pycharm_docs_search(q: str) -> str:\n\n   \"\"\"Search the local FAISS index of JetBrains PyCharm documentation and return relevant passages.\"\"\"\n\n   # Load vector store and create retriever\n\n   embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(\n\n       model=settings.openai_embedding_model, api_key=settings.openai_api_key\n\n   )\n\n   vector_store = FAISS.load_local(\n\n       settings.index_dir, embeddings, allow_dangerous_deserialization=True\n\n   )\n\n   k = 4\n\n   retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(\n\n       search_type=\"mmr\", search_kwargs={\"k\": k, \"fetch_k\": max(k * 3, 12)}\n\n   )\n\n   docs = retriever.invoke(q)\nWe are using a vector store to perform a similarity search with embeddings provided by OpenAI. Documents are embedded so the doc search tool can perform similarity searches to fetch the relevant documents when called. \ndef main():\n\n   parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(\n\n       description=\"Ask PyCharm docs via an Agent (FAISS + GPT-5)\"\n\n   )\n\n   parser.add_argument(\"question\", type=str, nargs=\"+\", help=\"Your question\")\n\n   parser.add_argument(\n\n       \"--k\", type=int, default=6, help=\"Number of documents to retrieve\"\n\n   )\n\n   args = parser.parse_args()\n\n   question = \" \".join(args.question)\n\n   system_prompt = \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant that answers questions about JetBrains PyCharm using the provided tools.\n\n   Always consult the 'pycharm_docs_search' tool to find relevant documentation before answering.\n\n   Cite sources by including the 'Source:' lines from the tool output when useful. If information isn't found, say you don't know.\"\"\"\n\n   agent = create_agent(\n\n       model=settings.openai_chat_model,\n\n       tools=[pycharm_docs_search],\n\n       system_prompt=system_prompt,\n\n       response_format=ToolStrategy(ResponseFormat),\n\n   )\n\n   result = agent.invoke({\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": question}]})\n\n   print(result[\"structured_response\"].content)\n \nSystem prompts are provided to the LLM together with the user’s input prompt. We are using OpenAI as the LLM provider in this example, and we’ll need an API key from them. Head to this page to check out OpenAI’s integration documentation. When creating an agent, we’ll have to configure the settings for `llm`, `tools`, and `prompt`.\nFor the full scripts and project, see here.\nContent generation tools\nAnother example is an agent that generates text based on content fetched from other sources. For instance, we might use this when we want to generate marketing content with info taken from documentation. In this example, we’ll pretend we’re doing marketing for Python and creating a newsletter for the latest Python release.\nIn tools.py, a tool is set up to fetch the relevant information, parse it into a structured format, and extract the necessary information.\n@tool(\"fetch_python_whatsnew\", return_direct=False)\n\ndef fetch_python_whatsnew() -> str:\n\n   \"\"\"\n\n   Fetch the latest \"What's New in Python\" article and return a concise, cleaned\n\n   text payload including the URL and extracted section highlights.\n\n   The tool ignores the input argument.\n\n   \"\"\"\n\n   index_html = _fetch(BASE_URL)\n\n   latest = _find_latest_entry(index_html)\n\n   if not latest:\n\n       return \"Could not determine latest What's New entry from the index page.\"\n\n   article_html = _fetch(latest.url)\n\n   highlights = _extract_highlights(article_html)\n\n   return f\"URL: {latest.url}\\nVERSION: {latest.version}\\n\\n{highlights}\"\nAs for the agent in agent.py. \nSYSTEM_PROMPT = (\n\n   \"You are a senior Product Marketing Manager at the Python Software Foundation. \"\n\n   \"Task: Draft a clear, engaging release marketing newsletter for end users and developers, \"\n\n   \"highlighting the most compelling new features, performance improvements, and quality-of-life \"\n\n   \"changes in the latest Python release.\\n\\n\"\n\n   \"Process: Use the tool to fetch the latest 'What's New in Python' page. Read the highlights and craft \"\n\n   \"a concise newsletter with: (1) an attention-grabbing subject line, (2) a short intro paragraph, \"\n\n   \"(3) 4–8 bullet points of key features with user benefits, (4) short code snippets only if they add clarity, \"\n\n   \"(5) a 'How to upgrade' section, and (6) links to official docs/changelog. Keep it accurate and avoid speculation.\"\n\n)\n\n...\n\ndef run_newsletter() -> str:\n\n   load_dotenv()\n\n   agent = create_agent(\n\n       model=os.getenv(\"OPENAI_MODEL\", \"gpt-4o\"),\n\n       tools=[fetch_python_whatsnew],\n\n       system_prompt=SYSTEM_PROMPT,\n\n       # response_format=ToolStrategy(ResponseFormat),\n\n   )\n\n...\nAs before, we provide a system prompt and the API key for OpenAI to the agent.\nFor the full scripts and project, see here.\nAdvanced LangChain concepts\nLangChain’s more advanced features can be extremely useful when you’re building a more sophisticated AI agent. Not all AI agents require these extra elements, but they are commonly used in production. Let’s look at some of them.\nMCP adapter\nThe MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows you to add extra tools or functionalities to an AI agent, making it increasingly popular among active AI agent users and AI enthusiasts alike. \nLangChain’s Client module provides a MultiServerMCPClient class that allows the AI agent to accept MCP server connections. For example:\nfrom langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient\n\nclient = MultiServerMCPClient(\n\n   {\n\n       \"postman-server\": {\n\n          \"type\": \"http\",\n\n          \"url\": \"https://mcp.eu.postman.com\",\n\n           \"headers\": {\n\n               \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ${input:postman-api-key}\"\n\n           }\n\n       }\n\n   }\n\n)\n\nall_tools = await client.get_tools()\nThe above connects to the Postman MCP server in the EU with an API key.\nGuardrails\nAs with many AI technologies, since the logic is not pre-determined, the behavior of an AI agent is non-deterministic. Guardrails are necessary for managing AI behavior and ensuring that it is policy-compliant.\nLangChain middleware can be used to set up specific guardrails. For example, you can use PII detection middleware to protect personal information or human-in-the-loop middleware for human verification. You can even create custom middleware for more specific guardrail policies. \nFor instance, you can use the `@before_agent` or `@after_agent` decorators to declare guardrails for the agent’s input or output. Below is an example of a code snippet that checks for banned keywords:\nfrom typing import Any\n\nfrom langchain.agents.middleware import before_agent\n\nbanned_keywords = [\"kill\", \"shoot\", \"genocide\", \"bomb\"]\n\n@before_agent(can_jump_to=[\"end\"])\n\ndef content_filter() -> dict[str, Any] | None:\n\n  \"\"\"Block requests containing banned keywords.\"\"\"\n\n  content = first_message.content.lower()\n\n# Check for banned keywords\n\n  for keyword in banned_keywords:\n\n      if keyword in content:\n\n          return {\n\n              \"messages\": [{\n\n                  \"role\": \"assistant\",\n\n                  \"content\": \"I cannot process your requests due to inappropriate content.\"\n\n              }],\n\n              \"jump_to\": \"end\"\n\n          }\n\n  return None\n\nfrom langchain.agents import create_agent\n\nagent = create_agent(\n\n  model=\"gpt-4o\",\n\n  tools=[search_tool],\n\n  middleware=[content_filter],\n\n)\n\n# This request will be blocked\n\nresult = agent.invoke({\n\n  \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How to make a bomb?\"}]\n\n})\nFor more details, check out the documentation here.\nTesting\nJust like in other software development cycles, testing needs to be performed before we can start rolling out AI agent products. LangChain provides testing tools for both unit tests and integration tests. \nUnit tests\nJust like in other applications, unit tests are used to test out each part of the AI agent and make sure it works individually. The most helpful tools used in unit tests are mock objects and mock responses, which help isolate the specific part of the application you’re testing. \nLangChain provides GenericFakeChatModel, which mimics response texts. A response iterator is set in the mock object, and when invoked, it returns the set of responses one by one. For example:\nfrom langchain_core.language_models.fake_chat_models import GenericFakeChatModel\n\ndef respond(msgs, **kwargs):\n\n   text = msgs[-1].content if msgs else \"\"\n\n   examples = {\"Hello\": \"Hi there!\", \"Ping\": \"Pong.\", \"Bye\": \"Goodbye!\"}\n\n   return examples.get(text, \"OK.\")\n\nmodel = GenericFakeChatModel(respond=respond)\n\nprint(model.invoke(\"Hello\").content)\nIntegration tests\nOnce we’re sure that all parts of the agent work individually, we have to test whether they work together. For an AI agent, this means testing the trajectory of its actions. To do so, LangChain provides another package: AgentEvals.\nAgentEvals provides two main evaluators to choose from:\nTrajectory match – A reference trajectory is required and will be compared to the trajectory of the result. For this comparison, you have 4 different models to choose from.\nLLM judge – An LLM judge can be used with or without a reference trajectory. An LLM judge evaluates whether the resulting trajectory is on the right path.\nLangChain support in PyCharm\nWith LangChain, you can develop an AI agent that suits your needs in no time. However, to be able to effectively use LangChain in your application, you need an effective debugger. In PyCharm, we have the AI Agents Debugger plugin, which allows you to power up your experience with LangChain.\nIf you don’t yet have PyCharm, you can download it here.\nUsing the AI Agents Debugger is very straightforward. Once you install the plug-in, it will appear as an icon on the right-hand side of the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhen you click on this icon, a side window will open with text saying that no extra code is needed – just run your agent and traces will be shown automatically.\nAs an example, we will run the content generation agent that we built above. If you need a custom run configuration, you will have to set it up now by following this guide on custom run configurations in PyCharm.\n\n\n\n\nOnce it is done, you can review all the input prompts and output responses at a glance. To inspect the LangGraph, click on the Graph button in the top-right corner.\n\n\n\n\nThe LangGraph view is especially useful if you have an agent that has complicated steps or a customized workflow.\nSumming up\nLangChain is a powerful tool for building AI agents that work for many use cases and scenarios. It’s built on LangGraph, which provides low-level orchestration and runtime customization, as well as compatibility with a vast variety of LLMs on the market. Together, LangChain and LangGraph set a new industry standard for developing AI agents.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "We’re continuing to modernize our IDEs, and in this update we’ve refreshed something you interact with constantly – the editor. These changes are designed to provide improved comfort, a cleaner look, and a more enjoyable experience during the hours you spend coding. We want to make the editor easier on the eyes, help you stay productive, and add a bit of fun variety.\nWhat’s new\nNew selection behavior: Selection now only highlights the actual text, not the blank space at the end of a line.\nNew smooth caret movement: A new animation makes caret jumps easier to follow. This is a long-awaited request from our users.\nSmooth blinking and rounded caret: The editor now has a more modern look and feel, matching the recently introduced Islands UI theme.\nNew selection behavior\nWhen working with code, you often have to select multiple lines at once, and it is important to be able to see what is included in the selection. The editor now highlights only the characters you actually selected, rather than the entirety of each line. This reduces the amount of blank blue space, making the selection itself clearer. It also removes ambiguity, letting you see exactly which characters are selected.\n\n\n\n\nNew smooth caret movement\nThis one has been on our wishlist for a long time. Like us, you work in the text editor every day, constantly navigating and modifying code. One way we’re making this experience more enjoyable is by introducing smooth, animated caret movement. You might not realize you need this until you try it. It enhances comfort and helps you stay oriented in your work, making the editor feel both more functional and visually pleasing.\nAt the same time, we recognize that excessive caret animations may give the impression of a delay when you’re typing and feel slow and unresponsive. We believe that typing must feel instantaneous, and we wanted to make sure to get it right. It is a significant challenge to introduce animations without breaking habits.\nThat’s why we built our own mode for caret movement – Snappy – which you won’t find in other editors. In this mode, the caret lands almost immediately where it should be and then settles with a smooth stop. The result feels quick yet smooth.\n\n\n\n\nIf you prefer clearly visible motion, there’s also Gliding mode, where the caret moves smoothly, making jumps easy to follow with your eyes. This option is similar to what you see in other popular text editors.\n\n\n\n\nYou can switch between movement modes using the Use smooth caret movement dropdown in Settings | Editor | General | Appearance. You can revert to the old behavior simply by disabling it.\nSmooth blinking and rounded caret\nWe’ve also given the caret a new look. Its smooth blinking feels calmer and more modern. As a final touch, we rounded it to match rounded elements throughout the IDE in the Islands UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to try it\nThese new features are all available in the latest early access builds of JetBrains IDEs, meaning there’s still time for us to adjust them based on your feedback. Give them a try and let us know what you think!\nTry them in the IntelliJ IDEA EAP today",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Disclaimer: This article was created using AI-based writing and communication companions. With its help, the core topics of this rich and nuanced livestream were conveniently distilled into a compact blog post format.\nIn our yet another JetBrains livestream, Vitaly Bragilevsky was joined by Carl Lerche, the creator of Tokio, for an in-depth conversation about the evolution of async Rust. Tokio has become the de facto asynchronous runtime for high-performance networking in Rust, powering everything from backend services to databases. During the discussion, they explored how async Rust matured over the years, the architectural decisions behind Tokio, common challenges developers face today, and where the ecosystem is heading next. If you missed the live session, you can watch the full recording on JetBrains TV. Below, you’ll find a structured recap of the key questions and insights from the conversation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1. What is TokioConf and why did you decide to organize it?\nTokioConf is the first conference dedicated to the Tokio ecosystem, taking place in Portland, Oregon. This year marks ten years since Tokio was first announced, making it a natural moment to bring the community together. Use the code jetbrains10 for 10% off the general admission ticket (excluding any add-ons).\nBuy TokioConf ticket\n                                                    \nTokio and Rust have become foundational technologies for infrastructure-level networking software, including databases and proxies. The conference is meant to reflect that maturity and growth. While the name highlights Tokio, the scope includes broader async and networking topics in Rust.\n\n\n\n    \n“Tokio and Rust have become one of the default ways companies build infrastructure-level networking software these days.”\n\n            \nQ2. When people hear “Async Rust,” what should they picture?\nAsync Rust is about more than performance. While handling high concurrency is a key advantage, async programming also improves how developers structure event-driven systems.\nTimeouts, cancellation, and managing multiple in-flight tasks become significantly easier in async Rust compared to traditional threaded approaches. Async in Rust leverages the ownership model and Drop, enabling safe and clean cancellation patterns.\n“Async is both performance, but also a way of managing lots of in-flight threads of logic well.”\n\n            \nQ3. How did Tokio begin? Why did Rust need it?\nTokio evolved from earlier experimentation with non-blocking I/O in Rust. Initially, Rust only had blocking socket APIs, and building efficient network systems required low-level abstractions. The journey went from Mio (epoll bindings), to the Future trait, and to async/await. Async/await was a major milestone in making async programming ergonomic in Rust.\n“The way async/await ended up being designed is actually quite impressive.”\n\n            \nThe language team managed to deliver memory safety and zero-cost abstractions in a way that wasn’t obvious at the time.\nQ4. Could Rust have something like Java’s virtual threads?\nRust originally had green threads and coroutines before version 1.0, but they were removed to preserve zero-cost abstractions and C-level performance characteristics. The overhead and complexity of stack management for green threads conflicted with Rust’s design goals at the time.\n“Rust actually started with lightweight virtual threads and coroutines.”\n\n            \nWhether such a feature could return is an open question, but today’s Rust async model is fundamentally different.\nQ5. How does cancellation work in Async Rust?\nCancellation in Rust is implemented through Drop. When you drop a future, its cleanup logic runs automatically.\nIf the future directly owns a socket, it closes immediately. If the socket is owned by another task (for example in Hyper), cancellation signals cascade through channels and trigger cleanup.\nHowever, async functions can be dropped at any point, and developers must write defensively to handle that reality correctly.\nQ6. Why did Tokio become the dominant async runtime?\nTokio became the de facto standard largely due to ecosystem momentum. Early crates like Hyper built on Tokio, and once that foundation solidified, switching runtimes required compelling reasons.\nOther runtimes exist (especially for embedded or specialized contexts) but for general server-side development, Tokio’s ecosystem depth made it the default.\n“There just wasn’t a good reason to not use Tokio.”\n\n            \nQ7. What about io_uring? Is it the future?\nio_uring can provide benefits, especially for batching filesystem operations. However, for networking workloads, real-world gains are often limited. It is more complex than epoll and has historically had more security issues. That said, Tokio allows mixing in io_uring-specific crates when you have a clear use case.\n“I’ve not seen real performance benefits with swapping out io_uring for sockets under the hood in Tokio.”\n\n            \nQ8. What were the most important design decisions in Tokio?\nTokio intentionally avoided reinventing scheduling patterns. Instead, it adopted proven strategies from Go and Erlang, including work-stealing schedulers.\nThe philosophy was to provide:\nGood defaults,\nStrong performance,\nEscape hatches for advanced tuning.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal was to make Tokio easy enough for most developers while still enabling performance optimization when needed.\nQ9. What are common mistakes in Async Rust?\nThe biggest issue comes from cooperative scheduling. Tasks only yield at .await, so long CPU-heavy work without awaiting can stall the runtime. Tokio provides runtime metrics to help detect such problems. Understanding how the scheduler works is crucial to avoiding tail-latency problems.\n“Because async is cooperative scheduling, you have to make sure you’re yielding back to the runtime regularly enough.”\n\n            \nQ10. What’s the best way to debug Async Rust?\nDebugging async systems often involves:\nTracing,\nRuntime metrics,\nAsync backtraces,\nTraditional debuggers.\n\n\n\n\n\nStuck tasks and high tail latency remain the hardest issues to diagnose. Better static analysis and linting tools could significantly improve this area in the future.\n“The biggest pitfall stems down to developers accidentally canceling something and not handling the cancellation appropriately.”\n\n            \nQ11. What is Toasty, and why are you building it?\nRust has matured as a systems and infrastructure language, but higher-level web application tooling remains underdeveloped. Toasty aims to explore that space by building a productive, ergonomic data modeling and query layer. The goal is not just performance, but developer ergonomics – while still preserving escape hatches for advanced use cases.\nQ12. Can Rust move into high-level web frameworks?\nRust already has a foothold in many organizations thanks to its infrastructure strengths. As internal Rust ecosystems grow, the demand for higher-level tooling increases. The missing piece is ergonomic, opinionated frameworks that prioritize productivity. The long-term vision is not to replace existing ecosystems, but to expand Rust’s reach upward into full-stack development.\n“I do think there’s a way to build productive and ergonomic libraries with Rust that focus on ease of use.”\n\n            \n\n\n\n\nClosing Thoughts\nRust has firmly established itself as the best choice for many infrastructure-level systems. The next frontier is higher-level application development. Tokio solved async infrastructure and now the ecosystem is evolving toward productivity and full-stack capability.\nIf you’re interested:\nExplore Toasty on the Tokio GitHub\nJoin the Tokio Discord\nAttend TokioConf in Portland, Oregon\nWatch our previous lifestream with Herbert Wolverson and explore everything you wanted to ask about Rust",

They are increasingly relying on AI to enable self-service analytics and accelerate data workflows, and it has become essential to establish shared business logic and context that both humans and AI systems can reliably understand and use. That shared context is the semantic layer.\nThat’s why we are thrilled to announce that Databao, a recent JetBrains product bringing semantic context and local data agents to data teams, is joining the Open Semantic Interchange (OSI), the open-source initiative led by Snowflake and other industry leaders to advance interoperable and governed semantic models.\nWhy open semantics matter\nThe Open Semantic Interchange (OSI) is an open-source initiative led by Snowflake and a broad ecosystem of partners across multiple domains and industries including BI, data engineering, governance, and AI. Its goal is to define a shared, vendor-neutral standard for semantic metadata, enabling it to move seamlessly across tools and platforms.\nBy making semantic context portable and interoperable, OSI reduces complexity, accelerates the adoption of AI and analytics tools, and helps organizations align on consistent data definitions, laying the foundation for more reliable insights and scalable AI innovation.\nWhat Databao brings to data teams\nOSI reflects the principles that have guided Databao from the start.\nFirst, trust at scale depends on semantics. Databao treats the semantic layer as living context, shared, governed, and continuously refined, so business logic remains clear and reliable as data usage grows.\nSecond, adoption requires flexibility. Teams shouldn’t have to choose between strong governance and usability. Databao already works with existing tools and logic. Teams stay in control of where their source of truth lives and how it’s maintained.\nBy joining OSI, Databao reinforces its commitment to an open, community-driven approach to sharing semantic models, so business definitions remain consistent and usable across every team’s workflows.\nAbout Databao\nDatabao is a new data product from JetBrains that helps data teams create and maintain a shared semantic context and build their own data agents on top of it. Our goal is to provide an AI-native analytics experience that business users can trust, enabling them to query and analyze data in plain language.\nDatabao’s modular components, the context engine and data agent can run independently, either locally or within your existing infrastructure using your own API keys.\nWe are also inviting data teams to build a proof of concept with us: we’ll explore your use case, define a context-building process, and grant agent access to a selected group of business users. Together, we will then evaluate the quality of responses and the overall value.\n      \n      TALK TO THE TEAM\n    \n\n\n\n\nLearn more about the Open Semantic Interchange on Snowflake’s blog, or explore both modules at databao.app .",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "How Airbnb ships dynamic config changes safely and reliably\n\nBy Cosmo Qiu, Bo Teng, Siyuan Zhou, Ankur Soni, Willis Harvey\nDynamic configuration is a core infrastructure capability in modern systems. It allows developers to change runtime behavior without restarting or redeploying services, even as the number of services and requests grows. In practice, that might mean rolling out a new address form for a region launch, tightening an authorization rule, or adjusting timeouts when a dependency is slow.\nLike any powerful tool, dynamic configuration is a double-edged sword. While it enables fast iteration and rapid incident response, a bad change can cause regressions or even outages. This is a common challenge across the industry: balancing developer flexibility with system reliability.\nIn this post, we will outline the expectations of a modern dynamic configuration platform, then walk through the high-level architecture of Airbnb’s dynamic config platform and how its core components work together to enable safe, flexible config changes.\nModern config platform essentials\nAs Airbnb’s business grows, our expectations for the dynamic config platform have evolved over time through our own learnings as well as industry best practices. These shape our view of what a good dynamic config platform should provide, including:\n\nA coherent experience for config management: The platform provides a streamlined, end-to-end experience for defining, reviewing, testing, and rolling out config changes. It covers the most common needs out of the box with rich built-in features, while still offering escape hatches for edge cases.\nStrong reliability, availability and safety guarantees: All config changes are validated, reviewed, and rolled out progressively, with clear ownership and well-defined access control. Treating config as code is a key focus: config changes are versioned, reviewed, and auditable like service code, but remain dynamic at runtime. The platform itself must be highly available so that services can reliably fetch and apply configs. Changes should be observable, with support for fast rollbacks when needed.\nSafe testing in isolated environments: Developers can validate config changes in isolated local or canary environments before they reach production.\nFlexible multi-tenant support: In a multi-tenant platform, different tenants have different risk profiles. The platform should allow config owners to customize how their configs behave per tenant, including deployment triggers, guardrails, and rollout strategy (for example, AWS zone or Kubernetes pod percentage-based rollouts).\nFast and controlled incident response: During an incident, responders can ship emergency configs as needed with clear auditability. The platform also provides observability for config changes, so incident responders can tell what changed, who was affected, when the change was made, and who made the change. This enables them to effectively identify the culprit and take action.\n\nHigh-level architecture\nAt Airbnb, Sitar is the internal name for our dynamic config platform. It provides a common way for teams to manage runtime behavior safely. At a high level, Sitar has four main parts: a developer-facing layer, a control plane, a data plane, and the clients and agents that run alongside application code.\n\nThe developer-facing layer is where config changes are created and reviewed. By default, configs are managed through a Git-based workflow, while a few exceptions are managed in the web interface (sitar-portal), which is also used for admin operations such as emergency deployments.\nThe control plane is responsible for orchestrating config changes. It enforces schema validation, ownership, and access control, and decides how each change should be rolled out: for example, which environments or AWS zone to target, what percentage of Kubernetes pods to start with, and how to progress the rollout over time. The control plane also specifies how to roll back the changes when needed, and supports routing in-flight configs to specific environments or slices of subscribers for fast testing.\nThe data plane provides scalable storage and efficient distribution of configs. It acts as the source of truth for config values and versions, and propagates updates to services reliably, consistently, and quickly.\nOn the product services side, an agent sidecar running alongside each service fetches the subscribed configs from the data plane and maintains a local cache. Client libraries inside the service then read from this cache and expose configs to application logic with fast, in-process access and optional fallbacks.\nPutting these together, a typical change starts from a Git flow, proceeds through control-plane validation and rollout decisions, into the data plane for distribution, and finally to agents and client libraries that apply the config updates to application logic.\nKey design choices\nIn this section, we highlight a few key design choices that shape how the platform looks and is operated.\nConfigs as code with a Git-based workflow\nConfig changes are by default managed by a Git-centric workflow. We use GitHub as the primary interface for managing configs, because we have an established and responsive internal team to manage GitHub Enterprise. GitHub integrates naturally with our existing CI/CD tooling, so we can reuse rich validation and deployment pipelines without re-inventing the wheel. This approach gives developers a consistent experience to make code changes: open a pull request, get reviews, merge, and deploy. GitHub also brings additional benefits such as mandatory reviewers, review and approval flows, and a change history. Configs under the same theme are grouped into tenants, with clear owners, customizable tests, and a dedicated CD pipeline.\nWhile the Git-based flow is the default, we keep a UI portal for teams that prefer a portal-based experience and as a shortcut for specific operational needs, such as fast emergency config updates that can bypass the normal CI/CD pipeline.\nStaged rollouts and fast rollbacks\nWhen a change is proposed, schema validation (checking that the config matches the expected structure and types) and other automated checks run in CI. The change is always reviewed and approved before rollout.\nOnce merged in the main branch, the control plane performs a staged rollout where the change is first deployed to a limited scope, then gradually expanded to a larger scope if things look good. At each stage of this rollout, the change is evaluated, the author and the stakeholders are notified if regressions are detected, and a fast rollback can be triggered if needed. Staged rollouts can greatly reduce the blast radius of bad changes and improve the overall reliability of the platform.\nSeparated control and data planes\nWe separate the “decide” and “deliver” responsibilities. The control plane focuses on validation, authorization, and rollout decisions, while the data plane focuses on storing configs and distributing them reliably at scale. This separation allows us to evolve rollout strategies and policies without disrupting the underlying storage and delivery mechanisms, and vice versa.\nLocal caching and resilient clients\nOn the product services side, we introduced a local caching layer between the agent sidecar and the client library to improve resilience and availability. The agent sidecar runs alongside the main service container, regardless of which language the service is written in, and periodically fetches subscribed configs from the backend and persists them locally. The client libraries then read from this local cache. Even if the backend is temporarily unavailable or degraded, services can continue operating on the last known good configs from the local cache.\nImpact on product teams\nIt is essential for the Sitar system to make life easier for product teams. In practice, its architecture changes how teams ship and operate in a few ways:\n\nRollouts become safer and more predictable. New behaviors, such as refined authorization rules, can be introduced gradually, verified on a small slice of traffic or in a specific environment, and rolled back quickly if needed. Teams spend less time worrying about “big bang” releases and more time iterating on behavior.\nTeams get more flexibility in how their configs are managed and rolled out. Each team can tailor a config flow to its own risk profile and release schedules. For example, teams can choose between automatic, manual, or cron rollouts, select the rollout strategy, and add extra checks. This lets teams keep their existing ways of working while still benefiting from a common platform and shared guardrails.\nIncident mitigation becomes faster and more controlled. When something goes wrong in production, incident responders can use observability tools that integrate config events to quickly locate the culprit change, then take quick action using the portal’s emergency flow. These emergency updates are fully auditable for future review.\n\nBesides these examples, the platform includes other improvements in usability, safety, and observability that we will not cover in detail here. Together, they contribute to a smoother day-to-day experience for teams that rely on dynamic configuration.\nConclusions and next steps\nDynamic configuration is a foundational capability of modern infrastructure. It enables fast iteration and rapid incident response, but only when it is equipped with strong safety features and provides a good developer experience. In this post, we shared how we think about a modern dynamic config platform at Airbnb, and how we developed Sitar’s architecture to meet those expectations.\nThe work is ongoing. As Airbnb’s business grows, we are continuing to refine rollout strategies, improve config testing, invest in observability and smart incident response tooling, and evolve other platform components.\nIn future posts, we plan to dive deeper into specific areas of the platform, such as how we optimize the Kubernetes sidecar that delivers config updates and how we design the developer experience around config management.\nIf this type of work interests you check out our open roles.\nAcknowledgments\nOur progress with Sitar would not have been possible without the support and contributions of many people.

        "contentSnippet": "이 글은 월드랩과 오토데스크 협업을 통한 공간 AI 개발 동향을 조사한 글이다.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n오토데스크 마블(Autodesk Marble) 기술적 배경\n마블(Marble)은 오토데스크가 직접 개발한 제품이 아니다. 이 모델은 'AI의 대모'라 불리는 페이페이 리(Fei-Fei Li) 교수가 설립한 AI 스타트업 월드랩스(World Labs)가 개발한 핵심 생성형 3D 월드 모델이다. 오토데스크는 2026년 2월, 월드랩스에 대규모 전략적 투자를 단행하며 자사 소프트웨어와의 통합 파트너십을 발표했다.\n마블의 구체적인 첫 코드 작성일이 공식적으로 공개되지는 않았으나, 회사의 설립과 주요 제품 마일스톤을 통해 개발 타임라인을 충분히 추론할 수 있다.\n\n초기 R&D 및 시작 (2024년 1월): 페이페이 리 교수를 비롯한 최고 수준의 AI 연구진들이 3D 환경 생성과 실시간 시뮬레이션을 목표로 2024년 1월에 월드랩스를 공동 창립했다. 마블의 근간이 되는 '공간 지능(Spatial Intelligence)' 연구와 코어 모델 개발은 이때부터 본격적으로 시작되었을 가능성이 높다.\n\n프로토타입 및 베타 (2025년 9월): 약 1년 8개월의 딥테크 연구 기간을 거쳐, 2025년 9월에 마블의 첫 번째 제한적 베타 버전이 세상에 공개되었다.\n\n정식 출시 (2025년 11월): 2025년 11월 12일, 텍스트, 이미지, 비디오 등을 입력받아 상호작용 가능한 3D 환경을 즉석에서 구축하는 마블 프론티어 모델이 일반 대중에게 정식으로 론칭되었다.\n\n기술 스택\n마블은 단순히 2D 이미지를 이어 붙이는 비디오 생성 AI가 아니라, 물리적 공간의 3차원 구조를 완벽히 이해하는 거대 월드 모델(LWM, Large World Models) 아키텍처를 채택하고 있다.\n\n3D 표현 포맷 (3D Gaussian Splatting): 마블은 시점이 변하면 형태가 무너지는 기존 생성 모델들의 한계를 극복하고, 변형 없이 영구적으로 보존되는 3D 환경을 생성한다. 생성된 결과물은 3D 가우시안 스플랫(Gaussian Splats)이나 메쉬(Mesh) 형태로 다운로드하여 언리얼, 유니티 등 다른 게임 엔진으로 내보낼 수 있다.\n\n실시간 프레임 모델 (RTFM, Real-Time Frame Model): 2025년 10월에 도입된 핵심 렌더링 기술이다. 단일 GPU 환경에서도 실시간으로 월드를 생성하고 상호작용할 수 있도록, 기존 프레임들을 일종의 '공간 메모리'로 활용하여 높은 디테일을 유지한다.\n\n웹 렌더링 엔진 (SparkJS.dev): 별도의 무거운 클라이언트 없이 웹 브라우저 환경에서 매끄러운 3D 렌더링을 구현하기 위해 Three.js를 기반으로 한 독자적인 렌더러인 'SparkJS.dev'를 사용한다. 이는 가우시안 스플랫과 전통적인 WebGL 에셋(glTF 모델 등)을 한 화면에 자연스럽게 혼합해 준다.\n\n공간 편집 도구 (Chisel): 사용자가 직접 상자나 평면 같은 단순한 원시 도형(Primitive)으로 3D 뼈대를 잡으면, AI가 그 맥락을 파악해 그 위에 시각적 디테일과 텍스처를 입히는 하이브리드 3D 편집 도구를 지원한다.\n\n\n\n기존의 스테이블 디퓨전 기반 3D 생성이 단일 '객체(Object)'를 깎아내는 데 집중했다면, 월드랩스의 '마블(Marble)'은 단일 이미지나 텍스트에서 거대한 3D 가상 세계(World) 전체를 생성해 내는 기술입이다. 이를 오토데스크의 기존 생태계와 결합하는 것이 핵심이다.\nA. 백본 모델 (Backbone Models)\n\nLarge World Models (LWM) / 공간 지능(Spatial Intelligence): 단순 2D 픽셀의 패턴을 모방하는 것을 넘어, 3D 공간의 기하학(Geometry), 재질, 빛의 반사, 물리 법칙을 스스로 추론하는 거대 세계 모델을 백본으로 사용한다.\n\nNeRF 및 차세대 뉴럴 렌더링: 월드랩스의 핵심 개발진(NeRF의 창시자인 벤 밀든홀 등)의 기술적 배경을 고려할 때, 마블의 코어 엔진에는 고도화된 Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF) 기반 기술이나 가우시안 스플래팅 개념이 결합되어 시점 변화에 완벽히 대응하는 일관된 3D 씬을 연산한다.\n\nB. 학습 데이터 종류 (Training Data)\n\n일반적인 2D 이미지 쌍을 넘어서, 3D 레이아웃, 공간 깊이(Depth) 데이터, 카메라 트래킹(Pose)이 포함된 다중 시점 영상, 그리고 오토데스크가 강점을 가진 기하학적/물리적 CAD 시뮬레이션 데이터 등 공간을 이해하기 위한 복합적인 고차원 데이터로 학습된다.\n\nC. 오토데스크와의 통합 파이프라인 (Integration Workflow)\n\n편집 가능한 3D 씬 (Editable 3D Environments): 마블은 단순한 비디오 영상(예: OpenAI Sora)을 생성하는 것이 아니라, 구조화되고 상호작용 가능한 3D 환경 자체를 출력한다.\n\n라스트 마일 편집(Last-mile Editing) 생태계: 마블이 프롬프트로 전체 공간의 초안을 순식간에 생성하면, 이를 오토데스크의 Maya, 3ds Max, Revit 같은 전통적인 소프트웨어로 바로 넘길 수 있다. 여기서 아티스트나 엔지니어가 직접 폴리곤 토폴로지, 리깅, 정밀한 재질 수정을 거쳐 최종 결과물(M&E 및 AEC 분야)을 완성하게 된다.\n\n\n\n유사한 오픈소스 3D/월드 생성 모델\n마블과 같은 강력한 상용 월드 모델에 대항하여, 연구자들과 개발자들이 투명하게 활용할 수 있는 오픈소스 생태계의 3D 생성 기술들도 빠르게 발전하고 있다.\n\nDiamondWM: 구글의 'Genie'나 마블과 유사한 성격을 지닌 대표적인 오픈소스 월드 모델이다. 대량의 FPS 게임 플레이 영상을 시각적으로 학습하여 개발되었으며, 사용자의 로컬 데스크톱 GPU에서도 직접 구동하며 실시간으로 상호작용할 수 있는 점이 특징이다.\n\nNVIDIA Isaac Sim (로보틱스 및 시뮬레이션): 프롬프트 한 줄로 세상 전체를 즉석에서 그려내는 마법 같은 생성형 AI는 아니지만, 오픈소스 기반의 확장 가능한 레퍼런스 프레임워크 역할을 한다. 주로 AI 로봇 모델 훈련을 위한 합성 데이터를 대량으로 생성하고, 물리 법칙이 적용된 가상 환경을 정밀하게 시뮬레이션하는 데 핵심적으로 쓰인다.\n\nTencent Hunyuan 3D 시리즈: 텍스트나 단일 이미지를 고품질 3D 에셋으로 변환하는 오픈 웨이트 기반의 생성 모델이다. 2025년 1월 버전 2.0 출시에 이어 최신 3.0 버전은 복잡한 건축물 생성 등에 폭넓게 활용되며 3D 아티스트들의 모델링 시간을 크게 단축시키고 있다.\n\n아울러, 다음과 같은 백본 기술을 살펴볼 필요가 있다.\n\n1. 가장 빠르고 완벽한 Image-to-3D Mesh\n\nStable Fast 3D (Stability AI): 이미지를 넣으면 0.5초 만에 완벽한 텍스처와 UV 매핑이 완료된 3D 메시를 뽑아내는 오픈소스 모델이다.\n\n\nStability-AI/stable-fast-3d\n\n\n\n2. 3D 가우시안 스플래팅 + 스테이블 디퓨전(생성형 AI)의 융합\n\nDreamGaussian: 스테이블 디퓨전의 상상력과 3DGS를 결합해, 이미지를 먼저 가우시안으로 빠르게 만든 뒤 실질적으로 활용 가능한 Mesh로 변환하는 선구적인 프로젝트이다.\n\n\ndreamgaussian/dreamgaussian\n\n\n\nThreestudio: 네르프(NeRF), 3DGS, 스테이블 디퓨전을 이용한 3D 생성 연구를 한곳에 모아둔 텍스트-to-3D 통합 프레임워크이다.\n\n\n\nthreestudio-project/threestudio\n\n\n\n\n\n3. 원본 렌더링 기술\n\n3D Gaussian Splatting (Inria): 실시간 렌더링 혁명을 일으킨 오리지널 소스코드이다.\n\n\ngraphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting\n\n\n\n\n\n최근 발표된 월드랩스의 마블과 오토데스크의 만남은 기존의 3D 제작 파이프라인(기획, 모델링, 렌더링)을 'AI 초안 생성, 디테일 모델 수정'이라는 차원으로 바꿔놓고 있다.\n결론적으로, 오토데스크가 왜 월드랩스에 그토록 막대한 자본을 투자했는지 그 전략적 배경은 명확하다. 수십 시간에 달하던 기존 CAD 및 3D 그래픽 설계자들의 수작업을 마블의 압도적인 '공간 지능'이 획기적으로 대체하고 보조할 수 있기 때문이다.\n\n\n\n레퍼런스\n\nWorld Labs lands $1B, with $200M from Autodesk, to bring world models into 3D workflows | TechCrunch\nFei-Fei Li's World Labs speeds up the world model race with Marble, its first commercial product | TechCrunch\nMarble\nAutodesk's $200m bet on spatial AI -

AI가 설계자의 작업 순서를 학습하여 파라메트릭 수정이 가능한 데이터를 추출한다.\n\n특징: 출력물이 명령어 시퀀스이므로 Fusion 360이나 SolidWorks 같은 툴에서 치수를 즉각적으로 수정할 수 있다.\n\nGitHub: \nChrisWu1997/DeepCAD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[3D 스캔/점군] → PointNet++ → z → Decoder → [CAD 시퀀스.

CAD 시퀀스 및 B-rep 생성 (DeepCAD의 진화형)\n단순히 모양을 맞추는 것을 넘어, 위상(Topology)과 스케치 제약 조건(Constraints)을 완벽하게 학습하는 모델들이다.\n\nSkexGen (Sketch-and-Extrude Generation)\n\n설명: DeepCAD를 발전시켜, 트랜스포머(Transformer) 구조를 이용해 2D 스케치 프로파일과 돌출(Extrude) 파라미터를 자동 회귀(Autoregressive) 방식으로 생성하는 최신 모델이다. 토폴로지 일관성이 훨씬 뛰어나다.\n\n\nyccyenchiao/SkexGen\n\n\n\nHextree / SECAD-Net\n\n설명: CAD 모델의 모서리(Edge)와 면(Face)의 상호작용을 그래프(Graph) 신경망으로 학습하여, 훨씬 복잡한 솔리드(Solid) 모델을 B-rep 형태로 생성해 낸다.\n\n\nPuhao11/SECAD-Net\n\n\n\nB. 기하학적 정밀도를 높인 가우시안 스플래팅 (3DGS의 진화형)\n3DGS의 단점인 '수학적 표면(Surface)이 없다'는 문제를 해결하여, 고품질의 메쉬를 뽑아내기 위한 모델들이다.\n\nSuGaR (Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting)\n\n설명: 가우시안 타원체들이 물체의 실제 표면에 납작하게 달라붙도록 강제(Alignment)하여, 3DGS에서 아주 깔끔하고 정확한 메쉬(Mesh)를 추출해 내는 SOTA 기술이다.\n\n🔗 \nAnttwo/SuGaR\n\n\n\n2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS)\n\n설명: 3D 부피를 가진 타원체 대신 2D 디스크 형태의 가우시안을 사용하여 형상의 경계와 표면을 극도로 정밀하게 재구성한다. 자율주행이나 로보틱스 매핑에 많이 쓰인다.\n\n🔗 \nhbb1/2d-gaussian-splatting\n\n\n\n\n\n3. 페이페이 리 교수(World Labs)의 LWM 설계 방식 추론\n그녀는 수학적 기반의 B-rep이나 파라메트릭 CAD 전문가는 아니지만, 컴퓨터 비전(ImageNet 창시자)과 로보틱스(Embodied AI)의 권위자로서 '카메라 렌즈를 통해 3D 물리 공간의 구조와 깊이를 추론하는 방식'에는 세계 최고 수준의 이해도를 가지고 있다.\n따라서 월드랩스의 LWM(마블)은 제조용 CAD 생성이 아니라, 물리 법칙이 작용하는 시뮬레이션 환경 구축에 초점을 맞추어 다음과 같이 설계될 것으로 추론된다.\n\n입력 및 추론 (2D/비디오 파운데이션 기반): 디퓨전 모델이나 트랜스포머가 단일 이미지/텍스트를 입력받아 보이지 않는 뒷면과 공간의 깊이(Depth)를 추론한다. (Zero123과 유사한 공간 상상력).\n\n공간의 표현 (하이브리드 3DGS/NeRF): 생성된 공간을 B-rep이나 명령어 시퀀스가 아니라, 렌더링 속도가 빠른 3DGS나 Neural Fields로 빠르게 메모리에 올린다.\n\n물리적 지능 부여 (Semantic & Physical Grounding): 여기가 마블(Marble)의 핵심이 될 것이다. 단순한 픽셀 덩어리(3DGS)에 분할(Segmentation) 라벨을 씌워 \"이 가우시안 덩어리는 '유리'이고 깨질 수 있다\", \"저 덩어리는 '의자'이며 중력의 영향을 받는다\"라는 물리적 속성을 부여한다.\n\n출력 (Interactive 3D World): 치수 측정이 가능한 CAD가 아니라, 언리얼 엔진이나 오토데스크 Maya에서 즉시 카메라를 돌려보고 객체를 물리적으로 움직여볼 수 있는 '인터랙티브 3D 씬(Scene)' 자체를 내뱉는다.\n\nCAD 진영(DeepCAD)은 설계 도면을 역공학하는 방향으로 발전하고 있고, 비전 진영(World Labs, 3DGS)은 카메라에 찍힌 세상에 물리 엔진을 덧씌워 가상 현실을 창조하는 방향으로 평행선을 달리고 있다.\n최근의 역설계 SOTA 모델들은 이 두 가지(신경망의 패턴 인식 + 수학적 피팅)를 하나의 파이프라인으로 합친 미분 가능한 피팅(Differentiable Fitting) 방식을 사용한다.\n신경망이 점들을 분류하고 치수를 대략 추정하면, 수학적 오차(Loss)가 발생한다. 이 오차 값을 역전파(Backpropagation) 시켜서 다시 신경망을 훈련하는 구조다. 즉, AI가 단순히 '비슷하게 생겼네'하고 끝내는 것이 아니라, \"내가 예측한 원통의 반지름이 실제 스캔 점들의 분포와 수학적으로 0.2mm 오차가 있으니 가중치를 수정해야겠다\"라고 스스로 학습하는 경지에 이르렀다.

AI 활용의 새로운 기준을 제시할 세 가지 혁신적인 앱으로 프롬프트 작성의 모든 고민을 끝내고, 여러분도 진정한 AI 프롬프트 마스터가 되어 보세요!\n여러분, 혹시 AI에게 질문했는데 영 엉뚱한 답변이 나와서 황당했던 경험, 저만 있는 건 아니겠죠? 아니면, 정말 완벽한 결과물을 기대하면서 프롬프트를 만들고 싶은데, 대체 어디서부터 손을 대야 할지 감조차 안 잡히셨던 적도 분명 있으실 거예요. 오늘은 이런 고민을 시원하게 해결해 줄 마법 같은 세 가지 도구를 소개해 드리려고 해요. 이 앱들만 제대로 활용하신다면, 프롬프트 전문가의 영역이 더 이상 꿈이 아니랍니다!\n\n\n제가 직접 경험해 보니, AI는 정말 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 답변의 질이 하늘과 땅 차이로 달라져요. 단순히 \"블로그 글 써줘\"라고 짧게 물으면, 어디서 많이 본 듯한 평범한 결과물만 툭 튀어나오기 일쑤죠. 그런데 만약 \"당신은 10년 경력의 여행 작가입니다. 20대 여성을 위한 제주도 3박 4일 여행기를 감성적인 톤으로 작성해주세요\"라고 디테일하게 요청한다면? 와, 이건 정말 완전히 다른 수준의, 심지어 감동적인 결과물이 나올 때도 있더라고요.\n하지만 문제는 매번 이렇게 완벽하고 정교한 프롬프트를 직접 만드는 게 너무 어렵고 귀찮다는 점이에요. 특히 \"AI한테 어떤 역할을 부여해야 하지?\", \"어떤 조건을 추가해야 가장 좋은 결과가 나올까?\" 같은 고민을 하다 보면 시간이 정말이지 눈 깜짝할 사이에 흘러가 버리죠. 그래서 오늘 제가 소개해 드릴 이 세 가지 앱이 필요한 겁니다. 각각 다른 역할로 여러분의 프롬프트 작성 전 과정을 빈틈없이 도와줄 거예요. 마치 요리할 때 레시피를 짜주는 셰프, 맛을 미세하게 조절하는 조미료, 그리고 나만의 특별한 레시피를 정리해 주는 요리책 같다고나 할까요?\n1. AI Prompt Studio: 메타 프롬프트 설계의 마법사  ‍♀️\n여러분, 혹시 ChatGPT나 제미나이를 쓸 때 \"제주도 여행 블로그 글 하나 써줘\"라고 짧게 물어보고 나서 결과가 너무 뻔해서 실망하신 적 있으실 거예요. 사실 이건 AI의 성능 문제라기보다는, 질문하는 방식에 아쉬움이 있었을 가능성이 큽니다. AI는 질문을 어떻게 하느냐에 따라 답변의 품질이 정말이지 하늘과 땅 차이로 달라지거든요.\n\n\n하지만 문제는 매번 \"너는 10년 차 작가야, 타겟은 누구고, 형식은 마크다운으로 해줘\" 같은 복잡한 프롬프트를 직접 짜기가 너무 어렵고 번거롭다는 거죠. 바로 이 번거로움을 해결해 주는 도구가 첫 번째로 소개해 드릴 'AI Prompt Studio'입니다. 이 앱은 단순한 질문이 아닌, LLM(거대 언어 모델)의 성능을 100% 끌어낼 수 있는 '메타 프롬프트(Meta Prompt)'를 전문적으로 설계해주는 앱이에요.\n주요 기능  \n빠른 프롬프트 생성: 복잡한 설정 없이 목표만 입력하면 버튼 하나로 강력한 프롬프트를 즉시 만들어줍니다. 바쁠 때 정말 최고죠.\n역질문 유도: 사용자의 요청이 모호할 때, AI가 스스로 부족한 정보를 파악하여 \"더 나은 답변을 위해 몇 가지 질문을 해도 될까요?\" 하고 되묻도록 유도합니다. 덕분에 불필요한 시행착오를 줄일 수 있어요.\n페르소나 부여: 목표 달성에 가장 적합한 전문가 역할을 AI가 스스로 설정하고 연기하도록 지시합니다. 예를 들어, \"최고의 마케터\" 역할을 부여해서 결과물의 전문성을 확 끌어올릴 수 있어요.\n비판적 개선: 입력한 내용을 비판적으로 분석해서 논리적 허점이나 모호한 부분을 찾아내고, 더 완벽한 구조로 즉시 수정해 줍니다. 스스로 고쳐나가면서 프롬프트 실력이 확 늘 거예요.\n다섯 가지 전문 모드  ️\n이 앱의 가장 큰 특징이자 핵심은 바로 목적에 따라 골라 쓸 수 있는 다섯 가지 전문 모드를 지원한다는 점이에요. 여러분의 상황에 맞춰 선택하기만 하면 됩니다.\nRTSC 마스터 모드: 역할(Role), 작업(Task), 구조(Structure), 체인(Chain)의 앞 글자를 딴 모드인데요. 예를 들어 \"유튜브 쇼츠 대본 생성\"이라고 목표만 입력해 보세요. AI가 알아서 \"숏폼 바이럴 마케팅 디렉터\"라는 역할을 부여하고, 쇼츠 성공 공식을 완벽하게 구조화한 프롬프트를 짜줍니다. 정교하고 복잡한 창작물을 만들 때 정말 최고입니다.\n비즈니스 프레임워크 모드: 직장인분들이라면 이 모드를 강력 추천합니다! 기획안이나 보고서 쓸 때 막막하셨던 경험 다들 있으시죠? 코스타(COSTAR)나 프렙(PREP) 같은 검증된 비즈니스 틀을 자동으로 적용해서 아주 깔끔하고 논리적인 업무용 문서를 만들어 줘요. 정말이지 퇴근 시간을 앞당겨 주는 효자 앱이라고 할 수 있죠.\n프롬프트 아키텍트: 정말 귀찮을 때, 이 모드가 마법을 부려줍니다. \"복잡한 법률 문서를 쉽게 요약해 주는 AI 에이전트를 설계해 줘\"라고 딱 한 줄만 써보세요. 그럼 AI가 필요한 제약 조건과 작업 프로세스를 알아서 추론하고 설계해 냅니다. 마치 옆에 유능한 비서가 있는 것 같아요.\n버텍스 AI XML 모드: 기업용 데이터 처리나 구조화된 데이터가 필요할 때 빛을 발하는 모드예요. 결과물을 깔끔한 XML 태그 구조로 만들어주기 때문에 복잡한 데이터를 분류하거나 추출할 때 아주 정확하고 표준화된 답변을 얻을 수 있습니다. 데이터 분석가나 개발자분들께 특히 유용할 거예요.\nCoT(Chain-of-Thought) 모드: 논리적인 사고가 필요할 때 활용해 보세요. AI가 사람처럼 단계별로 추론하며 문제를 풀도록 유도하는 방식인데요. 덕분에 수학 문제나 복잡한 논리 과제에서 AI가 엉뚱한 답을 내놓는 현상을 획기적으로 줄여줍니다. 이제는 그저 \"무엇을 할지\"만 결정하시면 됩니다!\n솔직히 말하면, 이 앱은 거의 '사기 앱'이라고 불러도 될 정도예요. 왜냐하면 프롬프트 엔지니어들이 밤새워 연구하고 강의에서 수십만 원을 주고 배워야 하는 복잡한 기법들을, 버튼 클릭 몇 번만으로 누구나 완벽하게 구현할 수 있게 만들어줬거든요. 저도 처음에 써보고 정말 깜짝 놀랐습니다.\n많은 분들이 AI를 쓰면서 \"AI가 별로야\"라고 아쉬워하시는데, 제 경험상 사실은 질문을 제대로 못한 경우가 대부분입니다. 그런데 이 앱을 쓰면 그런 문제가 완전히 해결돼요. 시작하는 방법도 아주 간단합니다. 브라우저에서 접속한 뒤 우측 상단 톱니바퀴 아이콘을 클릭해서, 구글 AI 스튜디오에서 무료로 발급받은 '제미나이 API 키'만 넣어주면 준비 끝입니다. 자, 이제 '시작하기' 버튼을 누르고 여러분만의 완벽한 프롬프트를 직접 설계해 보시기 바랍니다!\n\n \nMeta Prompt Master\n \nai-prompt-studio-v2-basic.vercel.app\n\n \n  잠깐! API 키 설정 팁: AI Prompt Studio를 시작하기 전에, 구글 AI 스튜디오(aistudio.google.com)에서 무료로 제미나이 API 키를 발급받으세요. 이 키만 있으면 AI Prompt Studio의 모든 기능을 막힘없이 활용할 수 있습니다. 설정 과정도 매우 간단하니 걱정 마세요!\n2. Prompt Equalizer Pro: 글의 뉘앙스를 조율하는 이퀄라이저  \n자, 다음으로 소개해 드릴 앱은 정말이지 흥미로운 도구입니다. 바로 'Prompt Equalizer Pro'인데요. 여러분, 혹시 음악 들으실 때 취향에 맞춰 저음이나 고음을 조절하는 '이퀄라이저' 써보셨나요? 이 앱은 그 원리를 글쓰기에 그대로 가져왔습니다. 앞서 보신 'AI Prompt Studio'가 프롬프트를 '만드는' 도구였다면, 이 앱은 이미 써놓은 글의 뉘앙스를 아주 정밀하게 튜닝하고 조정하는 도구라고 보시면 됩니다. 개인적으로 써보고 정말 감탄했던 앱이에요.\n\n\n핵심 기능: 5가지 슬라이더 ✨\n앱 화면을 보시면 오른쪽에 다섯 개의 슬라이더가 보일 거예요. 이게 이 앱의 핵심인데요, 마치 음향 이퀄라이저처럼 글의 다양한 요소를 미세하게 조절할 수 있습니다.\n창의성: 슬라이더를 오른쪽으로 쭉 밀면, 평범했던 문장이 아주 은유적이고 풍성하게 변합니다. 반대로 왼쪽으로 낮추면 군더더기 없이 아주 직설적인 문장이 되죠. 소설이나 시를 쓸 때 정말 유용해요.\n명확성: 글의 이해도를 높이거나 낮출 수 있습니다. 복잡한 내용을 쉽게 풀어 설명할 때 아주 좋고, 때로는 일부러 난해하게 표현할 수도 있습니다.\n감정의 깊이: 글에 담긴 감정의 농도를 조절합니다. 따뜻하고 감성적인 글부터 차갑고 이성적인 글까지, 원하는 감정 톤을 만들 수 있어요.\n문장의 길이: 길고 유려한 문장과 짧고 간결한 문장 사이를 오갈 수 있습니다. 저는 주로 짧은 문장으로 속도감을 주고 싶을 때 사용하곤 해요.\n전문성: 이 기능이 정말 압권인데요! 수치를 높이면 아주 격식 있는 공문서 느낌부터, 낮추면 친구에게 말하는 듯한 편안한 말투까지 자유자재로 오갈 수 있습니다. 독자층에 맞춰 말투를 순식간에 바꾸는 게 가능해요.\n슬라이더 몇 번 움직이는 것만으로 글의 온도와 질감이 완전히 달라지는 게 정말 신기하지 않나요? 처음에 써봤을 때 솔직히 '이게 된다고?' 싶었어요.\nAI 페르소나 기능  \n더 놀라운 건 'AI 페르소나' 기능입니다. 앱에서 미리 제공하는 10가지 캐릭터 외에도 여러분이 직접 '냉철한 탐정'이나 '비즈니스 전문가'라고만 입력하면, AI가 그 캐릭터에 딱 맞는 말투와 성격, 그리고 최적의 이퀄라이저 값까지 알아서 세팅해 줍니다. 정말 생각지도 못한 부분에서 감탄하게 되는 기능이었어요.\n사용법도 아주 간단합니다. 처음 설정에서 API 키만 넣고 저장 폴더를 지정해 주세요. 그다음 원하는 말투의 페르소나를 고르거나 직접 만든 페르소나를 선택한 뒤, 슬라이더를 슥슥 조절하고, 원본 글을 넣은 뒤 '명작 생성' 버튼만 누르면 끝입니다. 마음에 들면 바로 파일로 저장하시면 되고요.\n소설을 쓰실 때 캐릭터마다 말투를 다르게 고정하거나, 딱딱한 보고서를 부드럽게 다듬을 때 이만한 도구가 없습니다. 단순히 수치를 높이기보다, 이것저것 만져보면서 여러분만의 '황금 조합'을 한 번 찾아보세요. 저도 저만의 조합을 찾는 재미에 푹 빠져버렸답니다!\n\n \nPrompt Equalizer Pro\n \nprompt-equalizer.vercel.app\n\n \n3. 프롬프트 마스터: 당신의 프롬프트 라이브러리  \n혹시 매번 똑같은 프롬프트를 메모장에 복사해서 쓰거나, 예전에 써둔 정말 좋은 프롬프트를 못 찾아서 헤맨 적 없으신가요? 첫 번째 앱이 프롬프트를 '만들고', 두 번째 앱이 뉘앙스를 '바꿨다면', '프롬프트 마스터'는 자주 쓰는 프롬프트를 완벽하게 '관리하고 재사용하는' 도구입니다. 이 앱 하나면 반복되는 질문을 일일이 타이핑할 필요가 완전히 사라져요. 정말 솔깃하지 않나요?\n\n\n개인적으로 저는 이 앱이 작업 효율성을 몇 배로 끌어올려 줬다고 생각해요. 예를 들어, 콘텐츠 제작자라면 유튜브 스크립트 틀을 템플릿으로 저장해두고 주제만 바꿔서 빠르게 기획할 수 있고요. 개발자라면 복잡한 코드 리뷰 프롬프트를 템플릿화해서 언어와 코드만 바꿔 끼우면 끝입니다. 비즈니스 이메일이나 마케팅 카피도 타겟과 키워드만 툭툭 던지면 전문적인 결과물이 쏟아져 나오는 경험을 하실 수 있을 거예요.\n강력한 기능  \n템플릿 생성 및 AI 제안: 첫 화면에 있는 미리 설정된 10개의 프롬프트 템플릿을 바로 사용할 수도 있지만, 여러분의 취향에 맞는 새로운 템플릿을 직접 만들 수도 있어요. 여기에 'AI 제안' 버튼까지 활용하면 더 대박입니다. 제목만 써놓고 버튼을 누르면 AI가 알아서 적절한 설명과 본문 내용을 채워주거든요. 초안 짜는 시간조차 아껴주는 거죠.\n변수 값 채우기: 프롬프트를 실행하면 화면이 둘로 나뉩니다. 왼쪽에서 미리 정해둔 변수 값들을 채워 넣고 버튼을 누르면, 오른쪽에서 실시간으로 AI의 답변이 생성됩니다. 마치 코드를 실행하는 것 같은 느낌이에요.\n강력한 검색 및 카테고리 관리: 프롬프트가 많아져도 걱정 마세요. 강력한 검색 기능과 카테고리 관리 기능이 있어서 언제든 원하는 프롬프트를 1초 만에 찾아낼 수 있습니다. 저처럼 잃어버린 프롬프트 때문에 속상했던 경험이 있으시다면 이 기능에 감사하게 될 거예요.\n라이브러리 백업: 여러분의 모든 프롬프트를 한데 모아 관리할 수 있는 라이브러리 백업 기능까지 갖췄으니, 이제 프롬프트 마스터와 함께 반복 작업에서 완전히 해방되어 보세요!\n사용법도 직관적입니다. 처음 실행할 때 제미나이 API 키와 저장 폴더만 지정해 주시면 준비 끝이에요. 이제 이 세 가지 앱을 활용하면 AI와의 소통이 훨씬 더 즐겁고 효율적으로 바뀔 거예요. 정말 추천합니다!\n\n \n프롬프트 마스터\n \nprompt-master-ten-flax.vercel.app\n\n \n  핵심 요약\n✅ AI Prompt Studio: 복잡한 '메타 프롬프트'를 손쉽게 설계해 AI 성능을 극대화합니다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "우리는 쿠팡의 매우 작은 주주이다. 스트롱이 쿠팡에 직접 투자하진 않았지만, 스트로의 포트폴리오였던 Recomio라는 회사가 쿠팡에 주식교환으로 인수되면서 쿠팡의 주주가 됐고, 상장 주식을 대부분 팔았지만 아직 소량을 보유하고 있다. 우리 1호 펀드의 포트폴리오인데 이미 이 펀드의 나이는 14살이 되어 간다. 청산 시점이 지났기 때문에 우리의 LP들이 지난 몇 년 동안 꾸준히 물어봤던 질문이 남은 쿠팡 주식 처분 시점이다.\n이분들에게 나의 한결같은 답변은 “한국에 살면 직접 체감할 수 있는데, 쿠팡은 한국의 이커머스를 완전히 다 먹어버리고 있습니다. 제가 보기엔 현재 쿠팡 주가는(당시 $30 ~ $35 정도) 저평가되어 있기 때문에 가격이 더 오르면 팔 건데 그게 최소 $50 선이 되지 않을까 싶습니다.” 였다. 실은 매우 확신에 찬 자신 있는 답변이었다. 솔직히 겉으로는 $50라고 했지만, 내 마음속엔 쿠팡은 $100까지 간다고 믿고 있었다.\n그런데 이젠 솔직히 잘 모르겠다. 개인정보가 유출됐을 때만 해도 잘 해결하면 된다고 생각했는데, 이후에 쿠팡이 보여준 태도와 중요한 순간에 했던 결정들의 질이 상당히 실망스러웠고, 그 결과 때문에 현재 쿠팡 주식은 $20를 하회하고 있다. 역시 어떤 LP 분들은 나에게 과연 쿠팡 주식이 앞으로 $50 가 될 수 있을지 물어보고, 더 나아가서는 우리의 포트폴리오사가 상장하면, 스트롱은 어떤 기준으로 상장 주식을 처리할지 물어보는 분들도 있다.\n이 질문에 대해서 나는 몇 주 동안 시간 날 때마다 곰곰이 생각해 보고 있는데, 내 결론은 상장 시장은 참 어려운 시장이고, 비상장 회사에 투자하는 VC에겐 – 특히나 우리 같이 극초기 회사에 투자하는 – 제3외국어와 같이 이해하고 배우기 어렵다는 것이다. 엄밀히 말하면 쿠팡 사업 자체의 펀더멘탈이 무너져서 주가가 하락한다고 볼 순 없다. 쿠팡의 펀더멘탈은 실은 매우 강하다. 이 정도로 물류 인프라를 잘 운영하고, 이 정도로 세상 온갖 제품을 잘 판매하는 회사는 한국에 없고, 전 세계에도 몇 개 없을 정도로 사업은 잘 한다. 물론, 그 물류와 이커머스 사업의 인프라를 비인간적으로 운영하기도 하지만, 어쨌든 사업 자체만 봤을 땐 굉장히 탄탄한 회사다. 주가가 폭락하는 이유는 시장의 정서와 감정의 문제이고, 흔히 이 바닥에서 말하는 FUDGE(Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt, Greed, Emotion)가 크게 작용하고 있다.\n이번에 미국에서 만난 어떤 투자자는 중국의 VC에 오래전에 투자했는데, 이 VC가 초기 투자했던 중국 회사가 상장하면서 당시의 시총에 의하면 거의 2,000배의 돈을 (서류상으로) 벌었다고 했다. 하지만, 이 VC는 마치 내가 쿠팡에 대해서 확신했듯이, 그 회사의 펀더멘탈이 강하고 시장이 더 성장할 것이기 때문에 몇 년 후엔 더 많은 돈을 벌 수 있을 것이라는 자신감으로 상장 주식을 안 팔고 계속 보유했다고 한다. 그래서 4년을 더 보유했는데, 그동안 부침이 있었지만, 현재 가격은 4년 전과 똑같다고 한다. 서류상으로 돈을 크게 잃진 않았지만, 이 VC에 투자한 LP들은 4년 동안 실제 배분받은 건 한 푼도 없었고, 막대한 기회비용이 발생해서 굉장히 불만이 많은 것 같다. 실은 이 회사는 그동안 매출은 많이 증가했지만, 중국 정부의 규제와 방향에 대한 불확실성으로 인해서 주가는 제자리걸음을 하고 있었다.\n상장 시장은 비상장 시장과 많이 다르다. 남들은 비상장 시장이 비이성적이라고 하는데, 나는 오히려 상장 시장이 더 비이성적인 것 같다. 논리보단 감정, 두려움과 욕심이 주가를 움직이는 시장인데, 솔직히 생각해 보면 이 세상이 비이성적이라서 이게 고스란히 상장 시장에 전체적으로 반영되는 것 같다.\n쿠팡 사태로 내가 배운 점은 – 그리고 아직도 이 배움은 계속 되고 있다 – 우리가 투자한 회사가 상장하게 되면, 너무 욕심부리지 말고 적당한 시점에 파는 게 어쩌면 VC들에겐 더 맞는 전략일 수도 있다는 것이다. 계속 보유하면서 상장 시장을 공부하고 예측하는 방법도 있지만, 위에서 말한 여러 가지 요소 때문에 상장 시장을 분석하고 예측하는 건 우리 같은 초기 VC들이 잘할 수 있는 게임은 아닌 것 같다.",

N이 고정된 상황에서는 문제가 없을 것이다.\n문제는 N값이 변경되는 상황이다. 분산 시스템을 설계하는 입장에서는 시스템이 실패하는 상황까지 반드시 고려해야한다. 즉, 일부 노드가 실패해 N이 기존보다 작아질 수 있다. 물론 성능 향상을 위해 노드를 추가로 투입해 N이 커질수도 있다.\nN값이 변경되면 어떤 문제가 발생할까? hash(key) % N 의 결과는 대부분 달라질 것이고, 대부분의 데이터의 노드를 재배치 해야하는 일이 발생할 것이다. 아래 표를 한번 보자.\nhash(key)\n% 5\n% 4\n변경 여부\n\n\n\n\n11\n1\n3\nO\n\n\n22\n2\n2\nX\n\n\n33\n3\n1\nO\n\n\n44\n4\n0\nO\n\n\n55\n0\n3\nO\n\n\n66\n1\n2\nO\n\n\n\nN = 5 일때와 N = 4 일때, 하나의 데이터를 제외하고는 모두 노드 재배치가 발생한 것을 볼 수 있다. 이는 아래와 같은 큰\b비용을 낳는다.\n대규모 데이터 이동 및 복제 비용 발생\n(캐시라면) 대규모 캐시 미스 발생\n즉, 한마디로 노드가 추가/삭제 되었을 때 불필요하게 대부분의 키를 재배치 하게 되는 문제가 발생하는 것이다. 이번 포스팅에서 알아볼 안정 해시 (Consistent Hash) 는 노드가 추가/삭제 되었을 때, 일부 키만 이동하도록 만들어 재샤딩 비용과 대규모 캐시 미스 문제를 해결하기 위한 방법 중 하나이다.\n\n안정 해시 (Consistent Hash)\n안정 해시는 위와 다르게, 노드가 추가/삭제 되었을 때 평균적으로 k/nk/nk/n 개의 키만 재배치하는 기술이다 (이때, kkk 는 키의 개수, nnn 은 노드 수).\n\n해시 링 (Hash Ring)\n해시 링은 안정 해시에서 사용되는 핵심 자료구조이다. 해시 링을 이해하기 위해서는 먼저 해시 공간 (Hash Space) 에 대해 이해하고 넘어가야한다. 해시 함수로 SHA-1 을 사용한다면, SHA-1 에 임의 데이터를 입력한다면 출력값 범위는 0부터 2160−12^{160} -12160−1 이다. 이 범위가 SHA-1 해시 함수의 해시 공간이라고 할 수 있다. 좀 더 일반화 하자면, 해시 공간은 해시 함수의 출력값 범위인 x0 부터 xn 까지의 범위를 말한다고 할 수 있다.\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n이제 해시 공간을 둥글게 말아 양 끝이 만나는 모양으로 만들어보자. 아래와 같이 해시 공간의 양 끝인 x0 와 xn 가 만나는 원형 모양이 만들어진다. 이를 해시 링 (Hash Ring) 이라고 한다.\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n\n해시 링 위에 서버와 키 배치하기\n자, 이제 이 준비된 해시 링 위에 서버를 배치할 것이다. 해시 함수를 사용하여 서버를 해싱한 값에 해당하는 해시 링 위치에 서버를 배치한다. \nserverHash = hash(nodeId)\n\n그리고 이어서 키(Key)도 링 위에 배치해보자. 마찬가지로 아래와 같이 해시 함수를 사용하여 반환된 값에 해당하는 해시 링 위치에 키를 배치한다.\nkeyHash = hash(key)\n\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n그럼 이런 형태로 서버(s0 ~ s3)와 키(k0 ~ k3) 가 해시 링 위에 배치된 모습을 상상해볼 수 있다. 그렇다면 키는 어떤 서버에 배치되는 것일까? \n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n키는 자신으로부터 시계 방향으로 링을 탐색해 나가면서 만나는 첫번째 서버에 저장된다. 즉, 위 그림처럼 k0 -> s0 , k1 -> s1 , k2 -> s2 , k3 -> s3 와 같이 키가 배치되는 것이다.\n\n서버가 추가/제거 되었을 때\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n이렇게 해시 링 위에 서버와 키를 배치하고, 각 키는 시계방향으로 탐색해서 처음 마주하게 되는 서버에 배치하면 어떤 점이 유리할까? 위 그림처럼 해시 링 위에서 (1) 노드가 추가되거나 (2) 노드가 제거될 때, 해당 노드와 연관된 최소한의 키만 재배치 된다는 점이다. \n위 그림처럼 s5 서버가 추가되더라도 기존에 s0 에 배치된 k0 만 재배치 되었고, s2 서버가 제거되더라도 기존에 s2 에 배치된 k2 키만 s3 로 재배치 되었다. 나머지 k1 과 k3 키는 재배치 없이 그대로 유지된 모습을 확인할 수 있다.\n\n한계와 보완\n위 설계에는 2가지 한계점이 있다.\n파티션 크기가 균등하지 않다.\n키의 분포가 균등하지 않다.\n이 문제를 하나씩 살펴보자.\n\n한계점 1. 파티션 크기가 분등하지 않다\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n파티션이란 인접한 서버 사이의 해시 공간을 의미한다. 해시 링 위에 서버를 배치하는 것은 서버 식별자의 해시값 기준으로 수행되기 때문에, 위와 같이 파티션 크기의 불균등이 발생할 수 있다. 위 상황에서는 s0 에 배치되는 키보다 s1 에 배치되는 키의 수가 훨씬 많을 것이다. 즉 s1 의 부하가 훨씬 클 것이다.\n\n한계점 2. 키의 분포가 균등하지 않다\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n파티션 크기만 균등하다고 문제가 해결되지는 않는다. 해시 링 위의 키 위치 또한 해시값 기준으로 배치되기 때문에, 위와 같이 해시 공간의 한쪽으로 키 위치가 쏠리게 된다면, 특정 서버가 부하를 과도하게 부담할 수 있다. 위의 경우에는 s1 이 모든 부하를 감당하게 될 것이다.\n\n보완 : 가상 노드 (Virtual Node) 도입\n이 문제를 해결하기 위해 가상 노드를 도입할 수 있다. 가상 노드란 실제 노드를 가리키는 노드이다. 일종의 원본 노드에 대한 심볼릭 링크라고 생각하면 이해가 쉬울 것이다. 만일 특정 키가 실제 노드가 아닌 가상 노드를 가리키게 된다면, 그 키는 실제로는 가상 노드가 가리키는 원본 서버에 배치된다. 예를 들어, 아래 그림에서 s0_1 은 실제로는 s0 를 가리키는 가상 노드이며, k0 이 s0_1 가상 노드에 배치되었으므로, 실제로는 s0 서버에 배치되는 것이다.\n\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n이런 가상 노드를 무수히 늘리게 되면, 앞서 살펴본 파티션 크기와 키의 분포의 불균등을 해소할 수 있는데, 그 원리는 아래와 같다.\n가상 노드를 도입하기 이전에는 하나의 노드가 하나의 큰 파티션을 담당했지만, 가상 노드를 도입하면 여러개의 노드가 작은 파티션 구간 여러곳을 분산하여 담당하게 된다.\n그 결과 각 가상 노드가 담당하는 파티션 크기의 분산이 줄어들게 되며, 키 분포의 편차도 평균화된다.\n즉, 노드 별 담당 파티션과 노드별 키 개수의 표준 편차가 작아져, 데이터가 고르게 분포된다.\n단, 이는 Trade-off 인데, 가상 노드의 개수가 늘어날수록 표준 편차는 줄어들 수 있으나, 그만큼 가상 노드를 저장할 공간이 더 많이 필요하게 되기 때문이다.\n\nReferences\n가상 면접 사례로 배우는 대규모 시스템 설계 기초",

The principle Toss has always upheld, “User Centric”, isn’t just some grand slogan, but something that sits at the core of our daily conversations and questions.\n.css-1feg9au{font-size:24px;letter-spacing:0em;line-height:1.6;font-weight:bold;color:var(--adaptiveGrey900);margin:24px 0 4px;}\n.css-q3ktjb{white-space:pre-wrap;font-weight:bold;}Numbers Don’t Tell the Full Story\nData tells us “what” happened, but not “why.” That’s why we always listen to the users. When we set a goal, verify a hypothesis or identify a problem, real insights come from real conversations, not just numbers and assumptions. That is why our UX researchers build hypotheses based on various sources then validate them through tests and user interviews. The result isn’t guesswork, but insights rooted in real context that bring depth to every product decision we make.\nTools That Connect Us with Users\nBack in 2020, all research had to be done by the UX researchers. But as Toss expanded into banking, securities, insurance and more, research became broader and more complex, which led us to build our own tools to hear the voices of our users more clearly.\nThe first tool we built was the “Toss Form,” a simple way for anyone to create surveys, send push notifications to users and collect responses. This allowed not only UX researchers but also designers, product owners, and developers to run surveys themselves and get direct results. Next came the “Ask Me Anything” program. User research originally required recruiting participants and juggling schedules. Now, this program makes research effortless. Teams can instantly run online interviews with random users anytime, and uncover what data alone can’t tell us: When do people use Toss the most? What do users make of this phrase? Are our screens too complicated?\nConducting research became much simpler thanks to our internally developed tools and processes, but restrictions still remained. Usability Testing (UT) required preparing app prototypes and questionnaires, which took at least an hour for even the simplest tests. This kept us from conducting larger and more frequent tests. We needed to find a completely new way to check usability much more frequently and easily. That’s how “Huri-bot,” our AI-powered usability testing tool, was born. Trained on Toss user patterns, the bot can evaluate early prototypes and help refine designs and products with ease.\nUX Researchers, Drawing the Bigger Picture\nOnce the environment was set up for anyone to run tests easily, UX researchers were able to focus on more complex, in-depth problems. Their roles expanded beyond product features, into areas like analyzing business domains such as commerce and ads, and reviewing Toss’ overall UX flow to suggest improvements. They also dived deep into specific topics, such as studying the financial lives of senior users, testing accessibility for users with visual impairment, and validating interaction and graphic designs across the app.\nOn top of that, they find entirely new approaches to solve problems that existing methods could never uncover. Toss, which began with a single simple transfer service, now offers over 100 services. With so many services, it takes much more than a usability test to check if users are easily accessing their desired services. For that reason, we created TNS(Toss Navigation Score). TNS measures how easily users reach a service, and the results are used to improve entry points and information architecture across the app. For example, we might ask a user, “You can file a hospital bill with your insurer through Toss. Where would you go to do that?” We then track how they navigate the app and give a score. TNS helps us refine the overall service structure by analyzing what confuses users and what doesn’t.\nWe are continuously improving the way we collect VOCs and reflect them in our services. But every journey starts with the same question: Is this service truly for the users? The tools may change, but Toss principles remain the same. We keep our ears open to users every single day, because the best answers always start with them.\nResearch Story 1 :\nFinding answers where users get stuck\nThe “Personalized Loan Finder” service, launched in 2019, allows users to compare loan products and apply for the most favorable option when they are in genuine need of a loan. The TNS score for the service is 66, which is higher than the average of 59, but it still leaves room for improvement.\nA closer look at the user journey* through TNS revealed that many users struggled to find the entry point to the service.The reason was obvious. The entry button was labeled, “My Loan Limit,” which wasn’t enough to show that the users could actually compare loan products there. Some users even went straight to the “My Assets” page, thinking that loans were also part of their assets, only to find no path to the service. In other words, the user journey was cut off mid-flow.\n.css-18442ym{font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}.css-jfs1hr{white-space:pre-wrap;font-size:13px;line-height:1.7;word-break:keep-all;letter-spacing:0em;color:var(--adaptiveGrey600);white-space:pre-wrap;}*The end-to-end experience of a user interacting with a product to achieve a certain goal.\nFirst, we changed the label of the button. We tested 3 variations to replace the “My Loan Limit” label, and changed the label to “Compare New Loans,” which had the highest conversion rate. Second, we reinforced the link between the service and the “My Assets” page. By adding new content that displayed estimated interest rates and limits, users in need of a loan were directed more seamlessly into the “Personalized Loan Finder” service.\nThe impact was immediate. The internal data showed that the number of preliminary loan applications coming through the “My Assets” page jumped 144% MoM and 124% WoW.* This experience was a clear reminder of one simple truth: every answer can be found in the user.\n*As of July 2025\nResearch Story 2 :\nThe Toss Identity in the Eyes of Users\nIn 2023, Toss expanded its simple payment service, Toss Pay, into the offline world. Users could now pay with Toss not only online, but also at convenience stores, cafés, and restaurants. But this sparked a new challenge: How can we make Toss and Toss Pay known in the offline world?\nUntil now, Toss had thrived entirely in the digital world. The challenge was to find a way to present Toss in a consistent way in the unfamiliar offline world. We realized that a consistent graphic language was necessary, and we turned to user perception for the answer. When asked, “What comes to mind when you think of Toss?,” most users gave similar answers. They described Toss as simple, practical and convenient. One person said, “Toss feels like an app built in Excel by a genius engineer.” Funny as it sounded, it also revealed our brand’s essence in the most intuitive way.\nTo bring that abstract image into life, we conducted research on fonts, colors and logos. For fonts, most users said that English text in black felt the most like Toss. This was because that was the look users had grown familiar with from seeing it over and over in the press and marketing. When it came to colors and logos, the image most recalled by users was a blue logo on a white square background. This shows that users associated the brand more with the app icon, which is what they encounter on a daily basis, rather than a graphic symbol.\n\nToss’ blue logo alongside the English text “toss” in black, often seen in Toss’s press releases.\n\nToss app icon. The blue logo on a white square background is what most users recall when asked to picture the Toss logo from memory.\n\nThe Toss Pay payment icon, updated in the UI based on research findings.\n\nThese insights were quickly reflected. We applied the white background, blue logo, and black text across the Toss Pay UI and offline payment touchpoints, to reflect the image most familiar to our users.\n\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nWriter Myeonghwa Jung, Toss User Research Team Leader",
