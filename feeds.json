        "content:encodedSnippet": "This blog post summarizes changes to the vcpkg package manager as part of the 2024.11.16 registry release, 2024-11-12 tool release, as well as changes to vcpkg documentation throughout November. This release includes a command line option to force vcpkg to use classic mode even if a manifest file is found along with bug fixes.\nSome stats for this period:\nThere are now 2,508 total ports available in the vcpkg curated registry. A port is a versioned recipe for building a package from source, such as a C or C++ library.\n20 new ports were added to the curated registry.\n185 updates were made to existing ports. As always, we validate each change to a port by building all other ports that depend on or are depended by the library that is being updated for our 13 main triplets.\n88 contributors made commits (not counting the vcpkg maintainers).\nThe main vcpkg repo has over 6,400 forks and 23,300 stars on GitHub.\nvcpkg changelog (2024.11.16 release)\nThe following changes were made in November:\nAdded a command line option called –classic, which instructs vcpkg to skip looking for a manifest and run in classic mode, even if a manifest file exists in the directory hierarchy. Useful for multi-project codebases where some submodules may want run vcpkg in classic mode, while others do not (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1535).\nFixed a bug where vcpkg was claiming that certain builds were failing due to the x-block-origin option (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-tool#1513).\nOther minor bug fixes.\nDocumentation changes\nAdded documentation for new –classic command line option (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#423).\nUpdated overlay port documentation to clarify how overlay ports in subdirectories are handled by vcpkg (PR: Microsoft/vcpkg-docs#422).\nOther minor fixes (thanks @bansan85, @dg0yt, and @woopelderly!).\nIf you have any suggestions for our documentation, please submit an issue in our GitHub repo or see the box at the bottom of a particular article.\n\nTotal ports available for tested triplets\ntriplet\nports available\n\n\nx64-windows\n2,389\n\n\nx86-windows\n2,261\n\n\nx64-windows-static\n2,259\n\n\nx64-windows-static-md\n2,305\n\n\narm64-windows\n1,978\n\n\nx64-uwp\n1,319\n\n\narm64-uwp\n1,287\n\n\nx64-linux\n2,362\n\n\nx64-osx\n2,234\n\n\narm64-osx\n2,152\n\n\narm-neon-android\n1,646\n\n\nx64-android\n1,722\n\n\narm64-android\n1,695\n\n\n\nWhile vcpkg supports a much larger variety of target platforms and architectures (as community triplets), the list above is validated exhaustively to ensure updated ports don’t break other ports in the catalog.\nThank you to our contributors\nvcpkg couldn’t be where it is today without contributions from our open-source community.

You can update to this version using the Toolbox App.\nLet’s take a closer look at the highlights.\nDownload Fleet 1.43\nNew features\nIn version 1.43, we’ve added more branch actions to the Branches menu. You can now click on the three dots menu to choose from different actions. HEAD now has the options Push, Pull, Pull & Push, and Fetch. For remote branches, you can use New Branch from [name_of_your_branch], Compare with Current Branch, and Show Diff with Working Tree. For local branches, push and delete are also available.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’ve introduced multiple improvements to the AI chat. You can now use slash commands in the AI chat. For example, you can now type /chat_new to open a new AI tab, /chat_stop to stop generation, or /chat_regenerate to delete the latest response and generate it again. You can also type /docs to query Fleet and other JetBrains documentation directly. You can disable the commands with the settings.json flag `ai.chat.commands.enabled=false`.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can now run Git commands in natural language in the AI chat. You can disable the commands with the settings.json flag `ai.chat.git.enabled=false`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven with Smart Mode disabled, you can now search and attach symbols using the AI chat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFleet 1.43 enables LLMs to generate answers to user questions based on retrieved context. Here are some examples: Request information about recent files you’ve viewed, ask to see the full content of the file you currently have open, request retrieval of the code currently visible to you, ask for local changes to see uncommitted changes in the filetree, ask the AI chat to find information in READMEs, or check recently changed files in the ten latest commits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovements\nmacOS users can now download Fleet directly without using the Toolbox App. You can choose between separate disk images for Intel and Apple Silicon processors.\nWe’ve introduced a new icon for untracked files. While added files are marked with a green plus sign, untracked files will be shown with a green question mark in the Git window.\nThe font size of the color preview now matches the font size of the editor.\nWe’ve improved the Variable view when debugging Kotlin/Wasm in Fleet by introducing the JavaScriptDebugAware interface. The Variable view can now be customized to present Wasm values, making it more developer-friendly.\nBug fixes\nWe’ve also fixed several bugs:\nStopping a debugging session in the Debug window will now also stop the process in the console [FL-13660].\nText is now correctly aligned when adding a new watch to the debugger [FL-29480].\nWhen a breakpoint is hit during debugging, Fleet highlights the line and shows variables as intended [FL-26351].\n[macOS] You can now use shortcuts with ⌘ to search within the Keymap [FL-29808].\nSee the full release notes for more details about Fleet 1.43.\nPlease report any problems you encounter to our issue tracker, and stay tuned for further exciting announcements.\nJoin the JetBrains Tech Insights Lab to participate in surveys, interviews, and UX studies, and help us make JetBrains Fleet better!",

The plan was for SpaceCode to focus primarily on Git hosting and code reviews. For the last six months, we’ve been collecting feedback from SpaceCode users and polishing the product to make the user experience more enjoyable. In light of user feedback and current market trends, we’ve decided not to make SpaceCode generally available.\nHow this affects you as a Space and SpaceCode customer\nCloud customers (with Free, Monthly, and Yearly subscriptions) can use SpaceCode together with Space for free until May 31, 2025. Starting on June 1, 2025, access to SpaceCode and Space Cloud organizations will be disabled. Check our migration guide to learn more about how to migrate all your data to alternative software. \nOn-premises customers will be able to use Space and SpaceCode for an indefinite period of time and extended user numbers. Please check the updated Space Terms of Service here for more information on this change.\n\nIf you want to use Space On-Premises for an infinite period of time, you must update your license key before May 31, 2025. Please follow the instructions described in our FAQ.\nIf you want to continue using SpaceCode On-Premises, be sure to update Space to version 2024.2 or later.\n\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance during this transition period, our support team is here to help. You can check our FAQ or reach out to our support team at any time.\nThank you very much for having accompanied us on this journey. Please note this decision doesn’t affect any other JetBrains products – other products will continue to receive their usual support.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "How Airbnb uses data-driven segmentation to understand supply availability patterns.\nBy: Alexandre Salama, Tim Abraham\n\nIntroduction\nAt Airbnb, our supply comes from hosts who decide to list their spaces on our platform. Unlike traditional hotels, these spaces are not all interchangeable units in a building that are available to book year-round. Our hosts are people, with different earnings objectives and schedule constraints — leading to different levels of availability to host. Understanding these differences is a key input into how we develop our products, campaigns, and operations.\nOver the years, we’ve created various ways to measure host availability, developing “features” that capture different aspects of how and when listings are available. However, these features provide an incomplete picture when viewed in isolation. For example, a ~30% availability rate could indicate two very different scenarios: a host who only accepts bookings on weekends, or a host whose listing is only available during a specific season, such as summer.\nThis is where segmentation comes in.\nBy combining multiple features, segmentation allows us to create discrete categories that represent the different availability patterns of hosts.\nBut traditional segmentation methodologies, such as “RFM” (Recency, Frequency, Monetary), are focused on customer value rather than calendar dynamics, and are often limited to one-off analyses on small datasets. In contrast, we need an approach that can handle calendar data and daily inference for millions of listings.\nTo address the above challenges, this blog post explores how Airbnb used segmentation to better understand host behavior at scale. By enriching availability data with novel features and applying machine learning techniques, we developed a practical and scalable approach to segment availability for millions of listings daily.\nExample: Distinguishing Hosts with Similar Profiles\nConsider Alice and Max, two hosts with identical 2-bedroom apartments on Airbnb. However, Alice only lists her property in the summer, while Max has it available year-round — reflecting two distinct hosting styles.\nAlice’s seasonal availability suggests that she might live in the property most of the time, only renting it out during the summer months. Airbnb can support her with seasonal pricing tips, onboarding guides for occasional hosts, and settings suggestions.\nConversely, Max’s full-time availability indicates a more professional hosting style, possibly his primary income source. Airbnb can provide him with advanced booking analytics, tools for managing multiple reservations, and guidance on earnings and tax implications.\nTwo Hosts with Similar Profiles (Illustrative)\nHow can we create a dataset that captures these crucial differences in hosting behavior?\nDataset\nAvailability Rate\nA first step is to capture the host’s “intention to be available” on a specific night. Availability can be both analyzed from a backward-looking (in the past) or forward-looking (in the future) perspective. For simplicity, this post focuses on backward-looking availability, as it reflects the final state of a calendar after all changes in inventory, bookings and cancellations have occurred. Forward-looking availability is not as straightforward because changes can still happen between the analysis date and the future dates being analyzed.\nWe consider both:\n\nNights Vacant: nights when the listing was listed as available for booking on Airbnb, and remained vacant.\nNights Booked: nights when the listing was listed as available for booking on Airbnb, and was later booked on Airbnb.\n\nConsequently, we can calculate the corresponding Nights Intended to be Available, or Nights Available, for the 365-day look-back period as the sum of Nights Vacant and Nights Booked. We then divide it by 365, to obtain the corresponding Availability Rate.\nDistribution of Listings by Availability Rate in the Previous Year (Illustrative)\nFrom this distribution we observe:\n\nA considerable proportion of listings has little-to-no availability (~0% availability rate).\nConversely, a significant proportion of listings has near full availability (~100% availability rate).\nBetween these extremes, a significant set of listings emerges without strong breakpoints.\n\nHow can we further differentiate these listings that fall in the middle range?\nStreakiness\nFor listings that are not at either end of the spectrum, availability rate on its own is insufficient for capturing the nuances of how a listing is made available throughout the month. Consider listings A and B, which both have a 50% availability rate in a given month.\nTwo Listings with Similar Availability Rates but Distinct Calendar Patterns\nAlthough these listings have distinct availability patterns, they both have the same availability rate (50%)!\nListing A’s concentrated, block-like availability could lend itself to recommendations for weekly stay discounts, or advice for hosts who are away for a longer stretch — guidance which may not be suitable for Listing B.\nTo capture this distinction, we introduce “Streakiness”. In the example above, Listing A had 1 long streak of availability which was interrupted on night 16, while Listing B had 8 short streaks of availability, each lasting 2 nights before a 2-night break.\nWe define a streak as a consecutive sequence of availability with a minimum of 2 consecutive nights, followed by a subsequent period of at least 2 consecutive nights of unavailability, as described in the diagram below. Note that we initially considered using a single night of availability/unavailability as a threshold but found it to be a less reliable signal of the consistency that streakiness aims to measure.\nStreak Definition\nThis leads us to the corresponding Streakiness feature, computed as the ratio of Streaks divided by the number of Nights Available (computed in the previous section). At this point, we now have two relatively orthogonal features for our analysis: availability rate and streakiness.\nCombining Availability + Streakiness\nSeasonality\nWe found that while availability and streakiness provide a solid basis for measuring volume and consistency, they don’t capture a calendar’s “compactness” — in other words, its seasonality. As an example, consider Listings C and D, which both have around 15% availability and 14 streaks:\n\nListing C concentrates its availability within a narrower block of time (summer season) — see first calendar below.\nListing D distributes its availability more evenly across multiple quarters — see second calendar below.\nTwo Listings with Similar Availability Rates / Streakiness but Distinct Calendar Patterns\nSeasonality plays a crucial role in Airbnb’s business, as guest demand and host availability fluctuate with changes in seasonal appeal, holidays, and local events. Given this, we propose to create a Quarters with at Least One Night of Availability feature.\nAdditionally, we create a Maximum Consecutive Months feature which captures streakiness at a yearly scale, highlighting the longest continuous period a listing is available. Together, these features give clearer insight into seasonal patterns.\nFinal dataset\nThe final feature set includes all listings that were listed on the platform as of a broad set of dates. For each listing, we calculate the features we’ve designed in the previous sections. Then, we take a large, random sample across these dates. Finally, we scale the numerical features to ensure they are on a comparable scale.\nSample Listings Depicting our Feature Set\nSegmentation Model\nWe can now apply a K-means clustering algorithm to identify segments, testing models with K values from 2 to 10. Using the elbow plot to find the optimal number of clusters, we select 8 clusters as the best representation of our data.\nWe now have our clusters, but they don’t have names yet. Our cluster naming process involves several steps:\n\nChecking the distribution of each feature by cluster to identify strong differences (e.g., “cluster 1 has the highest availability rate”)\nRandomly sampling listings from each cluster and visualizing their calendars\nIterating on naming with a cross-functional internal working group\n\nThe output of this process is summarized in the table below, while the following diagram displays a “typical” calendar for each cluster.\nFrom Cluster Intuition to Cluster NameExamples of Calendars by Cluster\nSegment Validation\nSince we are measuring a latent attribute — underlying host behavior patterns that don’t have “ground truth” labels — there is no perfectly accurate way to validate our segmentation. However, we can use various methodologies to ensure that it “makes sense” from a business perspective, and reliably reflects real-life host behaviors.\nWe do so in three steps:\n\nA/B Testing\nCorrelates of Availability Segments\nUser Experience (UX) Research\n\nA/B Testing\nIn an A/B test, we assessed how the different segments previously used a feature that encouraged hosts to complete “recommended actions” (e.g., letting guests book their home last-minute) so they may earn a monetary incentive.\nExample of Host-Facing Recommended Actions\nWe show the use of the feature by each segment below. These results align with our intuition: hosts who use Airbnb for specific occasions or rarely may not be interested in following recommendations, even when incentivized. Similarly, “Always On” hosts, who are already highly engaged and proactive in managing their listings, might prefer to rely on their own strategies rather than follow Airbnb’s suggestions. Hosts who fall somewhere in between, with moderate levels of engagement, may be the ideal target for incentives, as they are likely open to adjustments that could boost their performance.\nExample of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects by Availability Segment\n(“CI” = Confidence Interval)\nCorrelates of Availability Segments\nWe also validate our clusters by checking correlations with known attributes. For instance, we confirm that “Always On” listings are likely more managed by professionals, or that “Short Seasonal” listings are likely more common in ski or beach destinations.\nFurthermore, we know it is common to observe an increase in the number of listings around big events. As expected, we observe a rise in “Event Motivated” listings leading up to and during major events periods, reflecting hosts’ responsiveness to increased demand.\nImpact of an Event on the % of Event-Motivated Listings (Illustrative)\nUX Research\nFinally, we know the UX Research team conducts host surveys to create qualitative personas, which we compare against our clusters to ensure they align with real-world behavior. For instance, we verify if segments with high weekend availability match hosts who self-report preferring weekend rentals.\nScaling and Productionization\nNow, we need to scale this segmentation to all our listings.\nTo achieve this, we use a decision tree algorithm. We train a model using our 4 features, with cluster labels from our K-means model as outputs. We also perform a train-test split to make sure the model accurately predicts each cluster.\nThis new model provides a simple, interpretable set of if-else rules to classify listings into clusters. Using the decision tree structure, we translate the model’s logic into a SQL query by converting the decision tree’s “IF” conditions into “CASE WHEN” statements. This integration enables the model to be propagated in our data warehouse.\nDecision Tree Structure\nApplications at Airbnb and Beyond\nAt Airbnb, various teams leverage these segments: product teams to inform strategy and analyze heterogeneous treatment effects in A/B tests, marketing teams for targeted messaging, and UX research teams for insights into hosts’ motivations.\nFor instance, we revealed an opportunity to boost Instant Book adoption among “Event Motivated” hosts, who may occasionally list their primary residence and prefer manual guest screening. Adding an option for hosts to only accept guests with a certain rating may make Instant Book more appealing to them, offering a balance between host control and booking efficiency.\nInitially designed for listing availability data, this segmentation methodology has also been adapted to host activity data. We developed a second segmentation focused on days with “host engagement” (e.g., adjusting prices, updating policies, revising listing descriptions) to differentiate occasional “Settings Tinkerers” from frequent “Settings Optimizers.”\nThis approach can also be adapted to other industries where understanding temporal engagement is essential, for instance, to distinguish:\n\nSocial Media: casual lurkers vs. active content creators\nRidesharing: occasional drivers during peak demand vs. full-time drivers\nStreaming Services: nighttime streamers vs. continuous streamers\nE-commerce: sales/holidays enthusiasts vs. year-round shoppers\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis blog post was a collaborative effort, with significant contributions from Tim Abraham, the main co-author.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Visual Studio 17.12 is here and comes with a host of new features for C++ developers. We’ve made improvements across our toolchain, C++ Build Insights, Unreal Engine support, and more. This post gives a quick overview of what’s available; for all the details, see What’s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.12 on the C++ blog.\nStandard Library and MSVC Compiler\nAs always, you can find all the details about our STL work in the changelog on GitHub. Thanks to everyone who contributed changes for this release!\nOn the conformance side, we have finished the implementation of C++23’s P2286R8 Formatting Ranges and the multidimensional subscript operator (e.g. my_3d_span[i,j,k]). This release also comes with some new C++26 features:\nP2997R1 Removing The Common Reference Requirement From The Indirectly Invocable Concepts\nP0952R2 A New Specification For generate_canonical()\nP2968R2 Make std::ignore A First-Class Object\nYou’ll find improvements to several debug visualizers, including those for mutex/recursive_mutex and move_iterator.\nWe added lifetimebound attributes to min, max, clamp, ranges::min, ranges::max, and ranges::clamp, allowing MSVC code analysis and Clang –Wdangling to detect dangling references in improper usage. See the documentation for warnings C26815 and C26816 for more information about lifetimebound annotations.\nFinally, we improved the performance of several types and algorithms. The popcount() function now uses a compiler intrinsic on ARM64. We further improved the vectorized implementations of the minmax_element() and minmax() algorithm families, and optimized the search() and find_end() algorithms. We also overhauled the implementations of condition_variable and condition_variable_any, which has knock-on effects on the timed_mutex and recursive_timed_mutex types.\nSet Command Line Arguments for Unreal Engine Projects\nFor Unreal Engine projects, you can now set the command line arguments to pass to your application directly from the toolbar. This toolbar component will show up by default if you have the Game development with C++ workload installed. If you don’t see it, you can add it by right-clicking on the toolbar and selecting Set Arguments.\n\nWe’ll be adding support for this feature to non-UE projects in the future. See Pass command-line arguments while debugging on Microsoft Learn for documentation.\nOpen Folder for Unreal Engine uproject\nWe have added an additional entry point to open your Unreal Engine uproject with Visual Studio’s uproject support. You can now open your uproject directly from the File menu by selecting Open > Folder…. This will open your Unreal Engine project in Visual Studio.\nFor more information on how to use this feature, see the documentation on Microsoft Learn and our announcement blog post.\nChange Signature Improvements\nWe have updated the Change Signature interface, allowing you to add, remove, and rearrange parameters in the parameter configuration section. Additionally, you can change their order by selecting and dragging them to a new position.\nThe access methods remain the same: press Ctrl+. to trigger the Quick Actions and Refactorings menu and select Change Signature. \nC++ Build Insights\nThis release of Visual Studio comes with a bunch of quality-of-life improvements for C++ Build Insights.\nYou can now select a few files, run Build Insights on them, and see exactly how these files impact build performance: \nYou can filter results by project and file path:\n\nNote that we now truncate paths to make them easier to read.\nYou can designate a folder to automatically store the reports so you can easily access them during your investigation.\n\nFinally, you can now see a short description on how each tab of Build Insights can be used, along with a link to the documentation for a detailed explanation.\n\nSummary\nWe hope this has given you a taste of what’s new. For all the details, see What’s New for C++ Developers in Visual Studio 2022 17.12 on the C++ blog.\nWe are very much interested in your feedback. The comments below are open. Feedback can also be shared through Visual Studio Developer Community.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Have you ever been frustrated by the tedious process of copying error descriptions from the Error List? Previously with Visual Studio, copying an error would include all column headers and row values, which isn’t always what you want. If you were planning to search for the error online, it was a hassle to clean up the text after pasting.\n\nNow when you `Ctrl+C` on a row in the Error List, only the error description is copied to the clipboard. You can still copy the entire row with `Ctrl+Shift+C` and now even directly search the web for the error. This makes it easy to get the information you need, saving precious time and headaches.\nAdditional options for copying\nVisual Studio 2022 now offers multiple copy options in the Error List for quick access to what you need.\nAfter selecting the relevant error, you can choose the option in the context menu or use the following keyboard shortcuts.\nContext menu option\nKeyboard shortcut\nDescription\n\n\nCopy\nCtrl+C\nCopy only the description\n\n\nCopy Row\nCtrl+Shift+C\nCopy the entire row, description and all\n\n\nSearch the Web for Help\nCtrl+F1\nSearch online for the error with Bing\n\n\n\nYou can also Copy and Copy Row with multiple errors at a time, so you can get all the information you need at once.\nConclusion\nWe are continually improving Visual Studio based on your feedback, striving to make your development experience as smooth and productive as possible. This update to the Error List copying functionality is just one of the many ways we are working to enhance your workflow.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The 12th update to Visual Studio 2022 is packed with lots of exciting new features that users have been asking for! Here are some of the awesome highlights from this release that are some of my personal favorites. For all the details, be sure to check out our release notes.\nCopy from the Error List\nYou see an error in the Error List that you don’t know how to fix. So, you select it and hit Ctrl+C to copy the description for a web search. After you’ve pasted it into the search engine, you realize it copied all column headers and row values instead of just the description. Now you must delete everything except the error description before you can perform the web search. This is cumbersome, but now we have a fix!\n\nWhen you copy an error from the Error List using Ctrl+C, only the description is copied to the clipboard. This makes it easier to search for the error online or share it with others.\nYou can still copy the entire row by right-clicking the error and selecting Copy Row from the context menu or hitting Ctrl+Shift+C.\nIf what you wanted to do with the error description was to do a web search, then just hit Ctrl+F1 to search for information about the error online.\nGo to line anywhere in code search\nSometimes you know that there’s an issue on a certain line in your code and you want to get to it quickly. Maybe you were told about an error being thrown on line 43 of some file, or you want to get to the bottom of a specific file.\nCode search now supports quick navigation to a specific line in your code.\nOpen Code Search and go to a line in the current document by using colon + line number. For example, :39 will navigate to line 39 in the active file.\n\nYou can also go to a line in a different document by using file name + colon + line number. For example, Order:43 will navigate to line 43 in Order.cs. If you don’t specify the exact file name, then the search will try to find the best match.\n\nDock the code search window\nIf you need Code or Feature Search to stay out of your way, you now have more control over the behavior of the search window.\nYou can now dock the search window and perform tool window actions with it, like Solution Explorer and others.\n\nAfter opening Code Search or Feature Search, click on the box icon at the top right to convert it into a tool window. You may choose to dock it elsewhere, pop it out, auto-hide, etc. You can revert to the dismissible window by closing the tool window and reopening search.\n\nWe’ve also simplified and cleaned up the previewing experience in search. There is now one button, indicated with an eye icon, to toggle the preview on and off.\n\nThe position of the preview panel will also adjust based on the dimensions of the search window.\n\nRefresh the Find results\nWe heard from a lot of users that it’s frustrating having to reopen the Find window and go through the motions of redoing a search to get updated results. Maybe you just refactored some code and want to confirm everything has been changed as expected, or you pulled some recent changes and need your recent Find operation to reflect those updates.\nAfter completing Find in Files, you will now have the option to Refresh the Find results in the window. You’ll get your updated results without having to redo the search.\n\nWe’ve also redesigned the former Repeat Find option to distinguish it from Refresh. It is now represented as Modify Find with a pencil icon. This button will still reopen Find in Files with the same search criteria you used for that results window.\n\nCopy files between instances\nWe are excited to introduce a highly requested feature in Visual Studio! You can now seamlessly copy and paste code files and folders between different Visual Studio instances using the Solution Explorer. Simply select the desired file or folder, use Ctrl+C or Ctrl+X, switch to another Visual Studio instance, and use Ctrl+V to include those files or folders in your new solution. All changes will be accurately reflected in the file system.\nIn addition to copying and pasting, you can also drag the files and folders from one instance of Visual Studio to another.\n\nPreviously, this functionality was available only for a few project types, but we have now expanded it to include all the major project types in Visual Studio.\nMulti-project launch configuration\nThe Multi-Project Launch Configuration feature allows you to set up and save profiles for launching specific projects within a multi-project solution in predefined states for debugging.\n\nThis simplifies the process of working with complex solutions, improves debugging efficiency, and enables easy sharing of configurations among team members.\nThank you!\nWe deeply appreciate your valuable feedback and feature requests, which have been instrumental in shaping these updates. Your insights have a profound impact on our development process, and we are committed to continually enhancing your experience with Visual Studio. We encourage you to keep sharing your thoughts and suggestions, as they are vital in helping us make Visual Studio the best it can be.

SUS 표준 문서의 역사</span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">SUS를 제대로 이해하려면 유닉스 역사를 알아야만 한다. 초기 UNIX는 AT&amp;T 벨 연구소에서 켄 탐슨(Ken Thompson)에 의해 만들어졌다. AT&amp;T는 당시 유닉스의 잠재성을 몰랐기 때문에 실비 수준에 소스 코드까지 제공했다. 그러나 이후 시장이 커졌고 AT&amp;T는 따로 회사를 만들어서 비즈니스를 하기 원했고, 이에 따라 소유권(라이선스)을 주장했다. 그러나 이미 소스코드가 많이 퍼져서 다른 회사나 대학에서도 변종들이 많이 만들어져있었다. 그 중에서 버클리 대학에서는 켄 탐슨이 교수로 있으면서 유닉스를 개량해서 BSD라는 걸출한 유닉스 분파를 만들어냈다. 이 후 BSD를 사용하는 대학과 기업체는 AT&amp;T와 소송을 할 수 밖에 없었다. </span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">각 진영은 지리하게 싸웠고, 그 과정에서 AT&amp;T를 대장으로 삼은 SysV(System V, 시스템파이브)계열과 BSD계열은 서로 호환성을 없애는데 열중했다. 누가보면 철천지 원수처럼 보였다. 시간이 흘러 법적 문제는 대충 봉합되었는데, 마침 Microsoft가 서버 시장에 진출하면서 충격을 받은 유닉스 진영은 급하게 화해를 할 수 밖에 없었다.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">그래서 1995년 SUS(Single UNIX Spec., 단일 유닉스 상세)가 탄생할 수 있었다. 참고로 마이크로소프트의 윈도NT는 1994년에 발표되었었다. 유닉스 진영은 과거의 라이선스 분쟁의 재발을 막기 위해 문서의 권리와 상표권은 비상업 단체인 OpenGroup으로 넘겨졌다. 현재 OpenGroup에서는 유닉스 뿐만 아니라 다양한 네트워크 및 관련 표준도 관리하고 있다.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\"><span style=\"color: #006dd7;\">최초의 IEEE std 1003.1 표준 문서는 1995년에 나왔으며</span>, 그 이후로 1998년, 2022년, 2008년, 2017년... 등을 거치면서 개정을 해왔다. 원래 2008년 issue 7 (SUSv4)에 이르러 완성형이 되었고, 2013, 2017년에 세세한 개정이 있었다. 그리고 마침내 2008년으로부터 16년이 흘러, 2024년 issue 8, SUSv5가 릴리즈되었다.</span></p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 data-ke-size=\"size23\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">1.3. 리눅스와 유닉스 표준과의 관계</span></h3>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Noto Sans Demilight', 'Noto Sans KR';\">유닉스 표준화 전쟁이 발발했던 80~90년대초까지 약 10년은 악몽의 시간이었지만 후일 리눅스를 탄생시키는 계기가 되었다는 점에서 새옹지마라고 할 수 있다.  원래 리누즈 토발즈(리눅스 창시자)는 90년대초 대학원생 시절 자신의 PC에 유닉스를 설치하고 싶었다. 그러나 후보였던 미닉스는 별로였고, 상용 유닉스는 비싸고 호환성도 부족했다. 그리고 BSD유닉스는 90~91년도 당시에는 라이선스 전쟁 때문에 제대로 개발, 배포되지 못했다. <span style=\"color: #ee2323;\">후일 토발즈는 당시 자신의 인텔 호환 PC에 BSD유닉스가 설치될 수만 있었다면 굳이 리눅스를 만들지 않았을거라고 이야기 했다</span>. </span></p>\n<p><figure class=\"imageblock alignCenter\" data-ke-mobileStyle=\"widthOrigin\" data-origin-width=\"496\" data-origin-height=\"336\"><span data-url=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cJLJOK/btsKTErTE5y/bfiEiYMU4Yov6GttVk3DPK/img.jpg\" data-phocus=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cJLJOK/btsKTErTE5y/bfiEiYMU4Yov6GttVk3DPK/img.jpg\" data-alt=\"리누스 토발즈 (Linux의 아버지)\"><img src=\"https://blog.kakaocdn.net/dn/cJLJOK/btsKTErTE5y/bfiEiYMU4Yov6GttVk3DPK/img.jpg\" srcset=\"https://img1.daumcdn.net/thumb/R1280x0/?scode=mtistory2&fname=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.kakaocdn.net%2Fdn%2FcJLJOK%2FbtsKTErTE5y%2FbfiEiYMU4Yov6GttVk3DPK%2Fimg.jpg\" onerror=\"this.onerror=null;

C언어 함수의 일부는 유닉스 환경에서 작동하게 만들어졌으나, C언어가 여러 운영체제에 포팅되다보니 공통으로 사용가능한 함수들이 C언어 표준으로 정해졌고, 나머지 유닉스 전용 C언어 함수들은 유닉스 표준에만 들어갔다. 따라서 유닉스 표준에는 C언어 표준 함수 + 유닉스 전용함수가 모두 포함된다.

        "contentSnippet": "유닉스 표준 IEEE std 1003.1 issue 8 (SUSv5) 개정판 소개 \n(부제 : C언어 표준과 리눅스와의 관계)\n \n참고 링크\n  온라인문서 - https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/\n  뉴스 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555529\n \n유닉스 표준인 IEEE std 1003.1은 셸(shell)과 명령어, 유닉스 파일 이름 및 경로, 소스 레벨의 함수 호환성 등을 정의하는 문서다. 유닉스 표준이기도 하지만 리눅스도 이 표준을 준수하기 때문에 리눅스 개발자도 필수로 알아둬야 한다. \n원래 유닉스 표준 문서 란 새로운 기능을 만드는 것이 아니라 기존의 기능 중에 공통으로 지원해야 하는 것들을 정의하고 문서화 한다. 다만 공통의 기능 중에는 필수(mandatory)로 제공해야 하는 기능이 있고, 해도 되고 안해도 되는 선택적(optional) 기능이 있다. 그리고 과거의 기능 중에 표준화에 충돌이 생기는 기능은 대체된(replaced) 기능을 제공한다. 여기서 제일 중요한게 바로 대체 기능을 명확하게 아는 것이다.\n다시 말하지만 표준이란 새로운 기능에 중점을 둔게 아니라 과거의 문제된 기능을 대체하는 것임을 명심해야 한다.\n \n1. 유닉스 표준 스펙이란?\n2024년 새롭게 릴리즈 된 유닉스 표준 문서의 정식 명칭은 IEEE std 1003.1-2024 issue 8이다. 한글(콩글리쉬)로 말할 때는 \"아이트리플리 스탠다드 일공공삼 쩜 일 이천이십사년 이슈 팔\"이라 부른다. 참고로 POSIX는 \"포식스\"가 아니라 \"파직스\"로 발음한다.\n참고 - IT용어 발음하기 - 스카시? 포식스? - https://sunyzero.tistory.com/257\n표준 문서는 SUSv8 (Single UNIX Specification version 8)이라고도 부르며, 혹은 XPG 8 (X/Open Portablity Guide)이라고 부를 수도 있다. 이름이 여러 개인 이유는 조직의 합병과 상표권 주인이 이리저리 바뀌면서 생긴 역사 때문이다.(집에서 부르는 이름, 회사에서 부르는 이름, 연인끼리 애칭이 다른거라고 이해하면 될 듯 싶다) 따라서 POSIX 1003.1-2024로도 부를 수 있고, 더 줄여서 POSIX.1-2024라고 쓸 수도 있는데 원래 POSIX.1은 서브 카테고리의 문서를 의미하므로 정확하게 동일하지는 않지만 다 알아듣는다. (UNIX 역사를 잘 아는 분들은 어떻게 말해도 다 알아듣는 편이다)\nIEEE std 1003.1 == SUS == XPG ~= POSIX 1003.1(== POSIX.1) \nIEEE std 1003.1-2024 Edition (SUSv5)\n\n\n \n1.1. SUS 표준 문서의 중요성\nSUS 표준에는 프로그래밍에 사용되는 C언어 함수 정의가 포함되어 있다. 그리고 개념 충돌이 발생하여 사용하면 위험한 행동이거나 그로인해 제거된 함수들도 알려주기 때문에 시스템 프로그래머가 필히 읽어야 하는 문서이다. 실제로 몇몇 사이트에 교육을 가보면 표준에서 되도록이면 쓰지 말라고하는 gettimeofday나 usleep, bzero, gets, signal 같은 함수를 쓰는 곳이 여전히 많다. 네트워크 프로그래밍에서도 gethostbyname, inet_addr 같은 함수도 이제 제거된 함수이다. 게다가 C99의 restrict pointer 영향으로 함수 원형이 바뀐 memcpy나 memmove도 사용법을 잘못알고 마구잡이로 쓰면 묘한 버그가 발생할 수도 있다. 그래서 표준 문서를 봐두는게 좋다는 것이다. 게다가 표준 문서가 그렇게 자주 나오는게 아니라 거의 10년마다 한번 나오는 정도니까 시간은 충분하다.\n표준 문서에는 함수 이외에 Base definition과 Rationale에 용어 정의(terminology)도 포함되어있기 때문에 매뉴얼을 읽을 때 명확한 의미를 이해하는데 도움을 준다.\n참고로 man page도 SUS 표준 문서를 기반으로 하고 있고, 표준 문서에 첨언하여 만들어진다. 따라서 리눅스 맨페이지들을 보면 맨 아래 Confirming to와 Notes에 표준 문서에 관련된 부분이 있다.\n \n1.2. SUS 표준 문서의 역사\nSUS를 제대로 이해하려면 유닉스 역사를 알아야만 한다. 초기 UNIX는 AT&T 벨 연구소에서 켄 탐슨(Ken Thompson)에 의해 만들어졌다. AT&T는 당시 유닉스의 잠재성을 몰랐기 때문에 실비 수준에 소스 코드까지 제공했다. 그러나 이후 시장이 커졌고 AT&T는 따로 회사를 만들어서 비즈니스를 하기 원했고, 이에 따라 소유권(라이선스)을 주장했다. 그러나 이미 소스코드가 많이 퍼져서 다른 회사나 대학에서도 변종들이 많이 만들어져있었다. 그 중에서 버클리 대학에서는 켄 탐슨이 교수로 있으면서 유닉스를 개량해서 BSD라는 걸출한 유닉스 분파를 만들어냈다. 이 후 BSD를 사용하는 대학과 기업체는 AT&T와 소송을 할 수 밖에 없었다. \n각 진영은 지리하게 싸웠고, 그 과정에서 AT&T를 대장으로 삼은 SysV(System V, 시스템파이브)계열과 BSD계열은 서로 호환성을 없애는데 열중했다. 누가보면 철천지 원수처럼 보였다. 시간이 흘러 법적 문제는 대충 봉합되었는데, 마침 Microsoft가 서버 시장에 진출하면서 충격을 받은 유닉스 진영은 급하게 화해를 할 수 밖에 없었다.\n그래서 1995년 SUS(Single UNIX Spec., 단일 유닉스 상세)가 탄생할 수 있었다. 참고로 마이크로소프트의 윈도NT는 1994년에 발표되었었다. 유닉스 진영은 과거의 라이선스 분쟁의 재발을 막기 위해 문서의 권리와 상표권은 비상업 단체인 OpenGroup으로 넘겨졌다. 현재 OpenGroup에서는 유닉스 뿐만 아니라 다양한 네트워크 및 관련 표준도 관리하고 있다.\n최초의 IEEE std 1003.1 표준 문서는 1995년에 나왔으며, 그 이후로 1998년, 2022년, 2008년, 2017년... 등을 거치면서 개정을 해왔다. 원래 2008년 issue 7 (SUSv4)에 이르러 완성형이 되었고, 2013, 2017년에 세세한 개정이 있었다. 그리고 마침내 2008년으로부터 16년이 흘러, 2024년 issue 8, SUSv5가 릴리즈되었다.\n \n1.3. 리눅스와 유닉스 표준과의 관계\n유닉스 표준화 전쟁이 발발했던 80~90년대초까지 약 10년은 악몽의 시간이었지만 후일 리눅스를 탄생시키는 계기가 되었다는 점에서 새옹지마라고 할 수 있다.  원래 리누즈 토발즈(리눅스 창시자)는 90년대초 대학원생 시절 자신의 PC에 유닉스를 설치하고 싶었다. 그러나 후보였던 미닉스는 별로였고, 상용 유닉스는 비싸고 호환성도 부족했다. 그리고 BSD유닉스는 90~91년도 당시에는 라이선스 전쟁 때문에 제대로 개발, 배포되지 못했다. 후일 토발즈는 당시 자신의 인텔 호환 PC에 BSD유닉스가 설치될 수만 있었다면 굳이 리눅스를 만들지 않았을거라고 이야기 했다. \n리누스 토발즈 (Linux의 아버지)\n\n\n그리하여 20세기말 컴퓨터 공학 최고의 역작이라는 리눅스의 탄생 계기는 AT&T의 탐욕으로 라이선스 전쟁을 일으킨 것이 원인이라는 점이 참 아이러니하다. 2024년 우리가 사용하는 현대 과학 시스템은 대부분 리눅스로 작동하고, 리눅스 때문에 과학 발전이 빨라진 것도 사실이다. 공학자들은 대체로 리눅스가 과학을 최소 20년 이상 앞당겼다고 평가한다. 우리가 타는 비행기✈️, 선박  ️ , 자동차   대부분은 리눅스로 구동되고 있고, 인터넷 서버의 대부분도 다 리눅스이다. 일반인들은 모르겠지만 정부 시스템, 은행, 증권, 보험 회사 등도 리눅스로 작동된다. 게다가 현대인은 전기없이 살 수는 없을텐데, 그 전력망 ️ 조차도 리눅스로 관리된다. 스마트폰 운영체제인 안드로이드도 리눅스 기반이다. 또한 요새 아주 핫한 인공지능도 리눅스 위에서 구동된다. 온세계가 리눅스 세상이고, 심지어 마이크로소프트조차 \"MS loves Linux\"라고 발표하면서 애저 클라우드에서 리눅스로 돈을 쓸어담고 있다.\n \n1.4. 표준 문서 연도별 목록\n표준 문서의 역사에 대해 약간 더 알아보도록 하자. 원래 첫 SUS문서가 발표된 1995년도에는 시간이 촉박해서 XPG(X/Open Portablity Guide) 4.20을 그대로 SUSv1 초안으로 발표했다.(겉장만 뜯어냈다는 소문이...) 이 후 본격적인 표준화 작업을 하게되었고, 1998년도에 실질적인 유닉스 통합 표준으로 SUSv2가 만들어졌다. 발표된 해인 1998년도를 붙여 UNIX98이라고도 부른다. 대부분 UNIX98이 실질적인 유닉스 통합의 첫 문서로 보는 경향이 짙다.\n그리고 2002년도에 C언어 국제표준인 C99의 영향과 리눅스의 영향, 리얼타임 시스템, 쓰레드 기법의 영향을 받아 SUSv3가 나왔다. 여기에는 POSIX 쓰레드(POSIX.1c)라든지 리얼타임 기법(POSIX.1c)이라든지 여러가지 상세가 통합되었다.\n2008년도에는 여러가지 명확하지 못한 용어나 기술들을 제거하고 SUSv4가 나왔다. 현재 리눅스와 유닉스는 대부분 SUSv4 기준에 맞춰서 개정되었다. 그래서 SUSv4는 거의 완성형에 가깝다고 평가받는다. 각 문서의 역사를 정리하면 아래와 같다.\n1995년 - IEEE std 1003.1-1995 issue 4.2 (SUSv1, UNIX95, XPG 4.20, _POSIX_C_SOURCE 199506L) \n1998년 - IEEE std 1003.1-1998 issue 5   (SUSv2, UNIX98, XPG 5.00) \n2002년 - IEEE std 1003.1-2002 issue 6   (SUSv3, UNIX98, XPG 6.00, _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L) \n2008년 - IEEE std 1003.1-2008 issue 7   (SUSv4, XPG 7.00, _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L) \n2017년 - IEEE std 1003.1-2017 issue 7   (SUSv4, minor reversion of issue 7) \n2024년 - IEEE std 1003.1-2024 issue 8   (SUSv5, XPG 8.00, _POSIX_C_SOURCE 202405L) \n\nSUS의 issue번호는 XPG의 major version을 의미하므로 issue 6는 XPG 6.00이고 C언어 헤더에서 '#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 600' 혹은 '#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200112L' 선언을 의미한다.(SUSv3의 POSIX C 표준은 2001년 12월 버전을 포함) 2008년 표준은 issue 7이므로 '#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 700' 혹은 '#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L'과 같다. 간혹 man page에 _XOPEN_SOURCE나 _POSIX_C_SOURCE를 define하라고 나오는 것은 이 표준 버전에 근거한다. \n따라서 2024년의 issue 8은  '#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 800'로 표시할 수 있다. 만일 시스템이 issue 7까지 지원하는 시스템이라면 features test macro에서 자동으로 _XOPEN_SOURCE 700 으로 간주한다. 앞으로 최신의 기능을 전부 사용하고자 한다면 '#define _XOPEN_SOURCE 800'으로 선언하고 시스템 프로그래밍을 하면 된다. 앞서 설명한 feature test macro와 연도별 유닉스 표준만 다시 정리하면 다음과 같다.\n표준\nFeature test macro (C언어)\n\n\nSUSv1(XPG4.20) \n _XOPEN_SOURCE = 420  or POSIX_C_SOURCE = 199506L\n\n\nSUSv2(XPG5.00) \n _XOPEN_SOURCE = 500\n\n\nSUSv3(XPG6.00) \n _XOPEN_SOURCE = 600  or POSIX_C_SOURCE = 200112L\n\n\nSUSv4(XPG7.00)\n  _XOPEN_SOURCE = 700  or POSIX_C_SOURCE = 200809L\n\n\nSUSv5(XPG8.00) \n _XOPEN_SOURCE = 800  or POSIX_C_SOURCE = 202405L\n\n\n\n \n현재 시스템이 지원하는 POSIX version은 getconf _POSIX_VERSION 명령으로 쉽게 알 수 있다. 아래는 Fedora 41 x86_64에서 내린 예시이다. 출력 결과인 200809L은 위의 SUSv4를 의미하는 것이다.\n$ getconf _POSIX_VERSION\n200809\n \n1.5. 유닉스 역사에 관한 만화\n일련의 유닉스 역사는 \"UNIX의 역사\"라는 책에 자세히 언급되어있지만, 책 앨러지가 있어서 금방 잠이 오거나 졸린 분은 https://joone.net/ 에서 F/OSS story 만화로도 볼 수 있다. 특히 8화 유닉스와 C언어, 9화 유닉스 철학, 10화 C언어의 아버지, 11~16화 BSD 유닉스 부분은 필독을 권한다.\n F/OSS Story 8화 유닉스와 C언어 링크 - https://joone.net/2017/02/18/%ec%9c%a0%eb%8b%89%ec%8a%a4%ec%99%80-c%ec%96%b8%ec%96%b4/\n\n \n2. C언어 표준과의 관계\n애초에 유닉스를 잘 만들기 위해 탄생한 언어가 C언어이다보니, 유닉스와 C언어는 매우 긴밀한 관계를 가지고 있다. C언어 함수의 일부는 유닉스 환경에서 작동하게 만들어졌으나, C언어가 여러 운영체제에 포팅되다보니 공통으로 사용가능한 함수들이 C언어 표준으로 정해졌고, 나머지 유닉스 전용 C언어 함수들은 유닉스 표준에만 들어갔다. 따라서 유닉스 표준에는 C언어 표준 함수 + 유닉스 전용함수가 모두 포함된다. (C언어 표준과 공부 방법에 대해서는 이전에 써둔 글이 있으니 링크를 따라가서 꼭 읽어보자)\n  [컴퓨터 관련/C언어] - C언어 공부법과 책추천 (C표준)  \n그런데 시간이 흐르면서 C언어 표준(정식명칭 ISO/IEC 9899)도 개정되어 왔는데, 크게 보면 ANSI-C 혹은 C89 (1989년, 1990년), C99 (1999년), C11(2011년), C17/C18(2018년) 정도가 있다. 그리고 유닉스 표준도 C언어 표준을 포함한다고 언급했듯이, 표준안 연도에 따라 포함하는 C언어 표준 개정판이 조금씩 다르다. 참고로 C언어 표준에서 큰 변화는 C99때였고, C11은 기능 확장, C17/C18은 결함 수정이다. 따라서 대부분의 실무는 C99에 준하거나 C99에 C17/C18의 기능 일부를 도입하는 수준이 제일 많다. 그러면 유닉스 표준은 C언어 표준을 어디까지 도입했을까?\nSUSv4-2017년까지는 C99 표준 사용 (C99는 실로 업계 표준이라고 생각하면 된다)\nSUSv5-2024년부터는 C17/C18을 사용\n  ISO/IEC 9899;2018 - C18 - https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n2310.pdf\n\n가장 최근까지만 하더라도 유닉스, 리눅스에서 가장 많이 사용하는 표준은 C99였다. 대부분의 C컴파일러는 C99를 기본값으로 삼기도 했다. 따라서 SUS도 issue 7(2017년)까지는 C99 표준을 참조하여 유닉스 표준을 제정했다. 하지만 2024년도 개정판에서는 C17 표준을 참조하였다. 따라서 C17의 각종 기능들이 들어왔다. 주요 신기능은 restrict, stdalign.h, unicode, C standard theads, C standard atomic operations, C memory-order (acquire, consume, release의 모델) 등이 있다. 이들 기능의 대부분은 C11, C14부터 제공되던 기능이다. 그러나 threads.h는 pthread가 더 좋고, 기능도 더 많기 때문에 유닉스/리눅스쪽에서는 잘 사용되지는 않는다.(리눅스에서 threads.h는 pthread의 단순 wrapper이다) \n그리고 atomic operation이나 memory-order의 경우는 gcc extensions를 대체하여 사용된다. 원래 GCC 확장 기능으로 많이 사용했던 기능인데, 표준화가 되었다고 생각하면 된다. 물론 표준화를 통해 함수명은 밑줄이 빠지게 되었다. 예를 들어 atomic_fetch_add라든지 atomic_fetch_sub 같은 atomic 기능들이 대표적이며, atomic_thread_fence,  atomic_signal_fence, atomic_flag_test_and_set_explicit 등에 적용하는 memory_order등도 있다.\n \n3. SUSv5의 신기능 or 제거된 기능\n가장 궁금한 것은 그래서 SUSv5가 뭐가 다른건데라고 물을 수 있는데 ‍♂️, 자세한 것은 표준안 rationale에서 볼 수 있다. 하지만 다 읽기 귀찮은 분들을 위해 주요 변경점만 빠르게 요약해 보겠다.\n \n3.1. sh (셸)\nbash셸의 일부 기능이 표준에 포함되었다. 대표적으로 pipelines의 pipefail이 있다. 이 기능은 shell script를 작성하는데 있어서 필수 기능으로 이를 잘 사용하지 못하면 초짜 취급을 받는다.\n \n3.2. 추가된 기능\n새롭게 추가되거나 변경된 C함수의 주요 목록은 다음과 같다.(모든 기능을 나열하기엔 너무 길기 때문에 일부 중요한 기능만 적는다) \n일반적으로 signal의 개입이나 flag에 따라서 제어할 수 있는 기능들이 포함된 함수가 추가되었다. 기존함수와 차별을 두기 위해 숫자를 늘렸다.\naccept4()\ndup3()\ngetentropy()\npipe2()\nsecure_getenv()\nreallocarray()\nquick_exit()\n\n\n\n그리고 C18의 stdalign.h에 포함된 alignas와 alignof가 POSIX.1-2024에 도입되었다. (기존에 제공된 _Alignas, _Alignof도 당연히 사용할 수 있으며 alias로 제공된다) stdatomic.h도 표준으로 포함되어 atomic_... 으로 시작하는 메모리 변경이나 테스트 기능을 사용할 수 있다. 스레드 환경에서 전역변수 flag 값을 변경할 때는 되도록이면 atomic 기능을 사용하는 것이 유리하다. C11의 aligned_alloc도 제공되지만, posix_memalign이 더 나은 방법이다. 하지만 일반적인 GCC 환경에서는 그냥 malloc을 쓰는게 낫다.\n \n3.3. 제거된 기능\n먼저 구식(obsolescent status) 함수로 지정되었거나 제거(removed)된 기능은 다음과 같다.\n= 주: obsolescent status로 지정된 함수는 유예기간을 거쳐서 표준에서 제거된다. 보통 10여년 정도 유예를 둔다.\n  Obsolescent status 로 지정 : inet_addr, inet_ntoa, encrypt, setkey \n제거된 주요 함수 (리눅스에서 지원하지 않는 fattach나 ulimit 같은 함수는 적지 않았다)\nftw - nftw를 대신 사용\ngetitimer, setitimer\ngets\ngettimeofday - 대체된 clock_gettime 함수에 대한 설명 https://sunyzero.tistory.com/161\nisascii, toascii\nrand_r\nutime\n\n\n\n시그널 관련 다음 함수들도 모두 제거되었다.\nsighold()\nsigignore()\nsiginterrupt()\nsigpause()\nsigrelse()\nsigset()\n\n\n\n표준에서 제거된(removed) 함수는 유닉스 표준을 지키는 운영체제에서 필수로 제공할 의무가 없는 함수들이다. 그래도 과거와의 호환성을 위해 계속 제공될 가능성이 높다.\n의무가 없는 함수들은 2가지 측면에서 조심해야 한다. 첫번째는 기능적인 문제 때문에 새로운 함수가 제안된 경우이고, 둘째는 이식성이 없어서 다른 여러 유닉스 혹은 UNIX-like 운영체제로 포팅하는 경우에는 제대로 작동을 보장하지 않는 것이다. 특히 첫번째 이유로서 제거된 대표적인 함수는 gettimeofday로 이는 윤초로 인해 흐른 시간을 구할 때 마이너스 값이 나올 수 있음을 유의해야 하기 때문에 제거되었다. 대신에 clock_gettime이 제공된다. 이미 과거부터 계속해서 경고를 했었던터라 이제는 사용이 많이 줄어들었다. 제거된 함수는 사용해도 당분간 문제는 없지만, 마구잡이로 쓰다간 잠재적 버그를 만들 가능성이 높다. 하지만 이식성을 생각하지 않는 경우라면 사용해도 무방한 경우도 있다. \n어떤 removed 함수가 사용해도 무방한지 아닌지는 SUS의 previouse 버전의 man 표준 문서의 application usage나 rationale, future directions 부분을 참고해야만 한다.\n \n4. 결론\n온라인 문서(https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/)라도 한번 살펴보자. 끝.\n\n\n \n* 히스토리\n2024-11-27 getconf 추가\n2024-11-25 초안",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Weekly Interpreting Compiler: \nA week's roundup of stories that didn't make the page one, but still seem important.\n망중립성, 민주주의, 보편적 인터넷 = 좋은 소리지만, 걱정되는 미래\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/17/technology/fcc-nominee-brendan-carr-trump.html\n\n\n\n트럼프의 당선으로 이어지는 변화에 여전히 정신없었던 한 주였다. 크고 굵은 뉴스들은 많지만, 이 블로그의 관점에서 볼 때, 가장 큰 변화는 브렌든 카(Brendan Carr)의 미국통신위원회(FCC) 위원장 후보 임명. 미국 정부인사가 한국 기술업계 사람들에게 뭐가 중요한가 싶겠지만 그동안 한국 통신업계와 기술업계는 모두 FCC의 결정에 귀를 기울였다. 이들이 말하는 ‘망중립성’ 원칙이 한국에도 엄청난 영향을 줬기 때문이다.\n망중립성은 말 그대로 통신망은 중립적이어야 한다는 정책인데 여기서 중립이 아닌 대립항은 주로 통신사 vs 기업을 뜻한다. 예를 들어 한국 통신사가 문자메시지 서비스를 하고 있기 때문에 카카오톡을 제한하거나, 보이스톡을 제한하면 망중립성 위반이다. 또 대기업 동영상 제공회사가 통신사에 돈을 많이 내기 때문에 스타트업 동영상 서비스는 제한한다면 망중립성 위반이 된다.\n문제는 트럼프 1기 때 이 망중립성 원칙을 폐지한다고 선언했던 것으로 거슬러 올라간다. 2기 출범을 앞두고 브렌든 카가 얘기한 것도 크게 다르지 않다. 바이든 정부 때 다시 복원해 가던 중이었는데, 대놓고 망중립성이란 없다고 공언하고 나섰다. 유튜브와 넷플릭스 각오하라는 뜻이다. 특히나 구글은 망중립성의 원칙을 강조하면서 상호접속(구글-통신사 사이 연결)은 캐시서버로 해결하고, 추가 망사용료 부담은 없다는 원칙을 지켜왔는데 새영향권에 바로 들어갈 가능성이 높다. 또 게임업체처럼 안정적인 고속연결이 필수적인 업체들도 함께 영향을 받을 수 있다. 무엇보다 (내수 중심의) 한국 통신사들은 반색을 하고 나설 가능성이 높지만, (수출도 하는) 국내 기술업계는 빨간불이 켜진 셈.\n다른 정책들도 만만치 않다. 언론 자유를 지키겠다, 그리고 모든 미국인에게 인터넷 연결을 제공하겠다는 것이다. 듣기에는 멋진 소리지만 숨겨진 의미가 있다.\n미국의 언론 자유를 훼손한 건 페이스북, 유튜브 같은 진보 성향 소셜미디어다. 이들이 콘텐츠 중재(moderation)라는 이름으로 표현의 자유를 검열해서 미국의 언론 자유가 훼손됐다고 한다. 이 때 검열되었다고 주장되는 논쟁적 콘텐츠들의 대부분은 이민자 추방, 낙태 금지, 총기소유 옹호 등 공화당 쪽 주장. 그러니까 민주당 편들어줬던 놈들 손봐주겠다는 뜻이다.\n모든 미국인에게 인터넷을 연결시켜준다는 것도 비슷한 소리. 도시 내 빈민 가구를 위한 얘기가 아니다. 시골 한적한 곳 까지 인터넷이 되도록 해준다는 얘긴데, 이걸 위한 가장 효율적인 방법은 위성인터넷이고 위성인터넷은 (트럼프를 도운 실세인) 일론 머스크의 스페이스X가 제일 잘 하니까 이 회사에게 보조금을 지급해 인터넷 보급을 늘린다는 얘기다. 미국인의 세금으로 트럼프를 위해 돈 많이 쓴 백만장자를 지원해 주겠다는 소리와 뭐가 다른지.\n양의 탈을… 아니 크롬의 탈을 쓴 안드로이드\nhttps://9to5google.com/2024/11/18/chrome-os-migrating-android/\n\n\n\n\n아이패드는 등장 직후부터 엄청난 인기를 끈 제품이었다. 하지만 안드로이드 태블릿은 영 인기가 없다. 세계 1위 스마트폰 메이커는 삼성과 애플이 20% 전후에서 엎치락뒤치락, 샤오미도 두자리수 점유율을 올리고 있다. 안드로이드 전체로 따지면 80%의 스마트폰이 안드로이드 계열이다. 반편 아이패드가 속한 태블릿PC는 완전히 원사이드 게임. 애플이 40%를 지배하고 있으며, 2위부터 5위까지의 점유율을 합해도 애플에 못 미친다.\n원인은 여러가지겠지만, 구글이 생각한 안드로이드 진영의 문제는 UX. 아이패드는 시작부터 아이폰과 동일한 사용자 경험을 제공해 인기를 끌면서도, 동시에 생산성 기능도 꾸준히 제공하며 스마트폰과 PC 사이의 어느 시장에 안착했는데 안드로이드 태블릿은 그냥 ‘못 생기고 쓰기 불편한 안드로이드’에 멈춰있다. 특히 맥과 아이폰, 아이패드는 서로 점점 닮아가며 진화하는 과정이라 구글도 동일한 시도를 크롬OS와 안드로이드OS에서 진행할 계획으로 보인다.\n태블릿(과 노트북)의 OS를 안드로이드로 통합하려는 시도인데, 태블릿 OS의 UX를 크롬의 모양으로 바꾸고 그 내부는 안드로이드로 전환시킨다는 게 골자다. 크롬의 장점은 애초 노트북용으로 개발된 OS여서 생산성 업무에 최적화됐다는 것이다. 다중창/다중탭 지원, 마우스와 키보드에 최적화된 UX, 외부모니터 지원 등 크롬북의 외양을 그대로 가져오기 때문에 안드로이드라 해도 생산성에 최적화된 UX를 갖게 되는 것이 장점. 또 내부가 안드로이드OS이기 때문에 개발자들이 새로운 앱을 개발하지 않고도 기존의 안드로이드앱을 조금 수정해 넓은 시장을 확보하도록 돕는 것 또한 장점이다. 아이패드보다 훨씬 싼, 크롬의 탈을 쓴 안드로이드 태블릿이 다가오는 중.\n\n\n\n\n좋은 칼럼: K-방역 다시 보기\n중앙일보 오피니언 코너의 “코로나 방역 성공했다고? 경제 과학 무시한 결정 아쉬워” 칼럼. 감염병 위기관리 정책의 목표가 무엇인가, 라는 근본적인 질문을 던진다. 감염자와 사망자 수를 낮추는 것이 과연 목표일까? 만약 현재의 감염자와 사망자 수를 낮추는 것만이 목표라면 모두 문을 걸어잠그고 집에 들어가면 된다. 사회가 제대로 돌아가지 않아 굶어죽는 사람이 나오고, 미래세대의 교육이 엉망이 되며, 사회시스템이 붕괴된다 해도 “당장”, “감염병으로” 죽는 사람은 나오지 않는다. 그래서 “감염 자체로 인한 손실과 방역 정책의 부작용으로 생기는 손실의 합을 최소화”하는 게 목표여야 한다는 얘기다. 우리는 지난 K-방역을 통해 무엇을 잃었는지 다시 생각해 봐야 할 때.",

This is where Kotlin Flows come in.\nsupend 함수는 비동기적인 값을 불러올 순 있지만 지속적인 값의 흐름을 가지지는 않는다.\n\nsuspend fun fetchData() = /* 생략 */\n\nfun main() {\n    println(fetchData())\n}\n\n\n이런 흐름은 사실 누구나 이해하기 쉽다. main 함수에서 fetchData()를 호출하면 응답이 딱 1번 온다는 것이다.\n그럼 이를 2회로 반복하면? main 함수에 한 줄 더 추가하거나, (0..1).forEach {}처럼 자동화할 수 있다.\n\nsuspend fun fetchData() = /* 생략 */\n\nfun main() {\n    println(fetchData())\n    println(fetchData()) // 1회 더 추가\n}\n\n\n\n지속적인 흐름\nflow를 통한 지속적인 흐름을 만든다는 것은 아래와 같다.\n함수를 호출한다.\nFlow로 생성한 객체를 리턴 받는다.\n구독(collect) 한다.\n    \ncollect()을 하기 전에도 새로운 데이터 흐름이 있다.\ncollect()을 해야만 새로운 데이터 흐름이 시작한다.\nflow를 활용하는 방식에서의 지속적인 흐름은 이와 같다.\n이를 아무나 이해할 수 있는 내용이 뭐가 있을까?\ncollect() 하기 전에도 새로운 데이터 흐름이 있다.\n    \n물은 흐른다.\n스트리밍 서비스를 월 결제한다.\ncollect() 해야 만 새로운 데이터 흐름이 시작된다.\n    \n커피를 주문한다.\n음식을 주문한다.\n위의 예들이 맞을 수도 있고, 엄밀히 따지면 적합한 예가 아닐 수 있지만 대략 구분해 보면 이와 같을 수 있다.\n결국 이미 있는 걸 필요할 때만 받아쓴다로 표현할 수 있는 것을 HotFlow(HotStream)으로 칭하고, 새로운 줌의 발생으로 만들기 시작한다는 ColdFlow(ColdStream)으로 칭한다.\n\nColdFlow\nColdFlow인 flow {}에 대한 코드가 아래와 같다.\n\nval flow = flow {\n    (1..6).forEach {\n        emit(it)\n        delay(1_000L)\n    }\n}\n\n// collect 1\nflow\n    .onEach { println(it) }\n    .launchIn(viewModelScope)\n\ndelay(2_000L) // 2초 후 구독\n\n// collect 2\nflow\n    .onEach { println(it) }\n    .launchIn(viewModelScope)\n\n\n이에 대한 출력 결과는 아래와 같다.\n1(new), 2, 1(new), 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 6, 5, 6\n각각을 보면 1-6까지 정상 출력함을 알 수 있다.\n이를 그림으로 표현하면 아래와 같다.\n\nflow에서의 데이터 흐름은 결국 collect 전에는 아무런 시작을 하지 않음을 알 수 있다.\n\nReactiveX의 HotStream\nHotFlow는 collect 과는 상관없이 물이 흘러가듯 언제나 흘러가고 있다.\n구독 시점을 기준으로 이전의 데이터 흐름부터 시작할지 항상 새로운 흐름만 받을지가 다를 뿐이다.\nReactiveX에는 이런 형태의 함수가 총 4가지 있는데 아래와 같다.\nAsyncSubject\n구독한 시점의 마지막 값을 방출하고, 새로운 구독이 발생해도 역시 마지막 값을 방출한다.(항상 최신의 마지막만 제공한다)\n\nBehaviorSubject\n구독한 시점의 최근 데이터 1개와 이후 데이터 흐름을 받을 수 있다.\n\nPublishSubject\n구독한 시점 이후의 최신 데이터를 순차 흐름을 받을 수 있다.\n\nReplaySubject\n구독 시점 앞서 발생한 모든 값을 다시 받을 수 있다.\n\nReactiveX - Subject - link\nReactiveX에는 4가지의 Subject가 HotStream에 해당하는데 방식도 다양하다. Flow에서는 크게 2가지를 제공한다.\nStateFlow : 구독한 시점의 최근 데이터 1개와 이후 데이터 흐름을 받을 수 있다.\nSharedFlow : SharedFlow의 옵션을 통해 구독 시점을 다양하게 관리할 수 있으며, 동일한 값 역시 방출이 가능하다.\nStateFlow는 상태를 관리하기 위한 최적의 상태를 제공해 주기 위해 추가되었는데 ReactiveX에서 PublishSubject와 동일함을 알 수 있다.\n엄밀히 따지면 RectiveX Subject와는 다른 부분이 존재하지만 이해도를 높이기 위해 그림을 포함하였다.\n\nFlow의 HotFlow(HotStream)\nFlow에는 HotStream으로 2개를 제공 있다.\nStateFlow\nStateFlow는 equals, hashCode가 같은 경우 방출하지 않으며, 구독 시점 최근 마지막 데이터 1개와 이후 흐름을 받을 수 있다.\n1개의 StateFlow와 2개의 collect()하는 코드를 아래와 같이 구현하였다.\n\nval stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)\n\n// collect 1\nstateFlow\n    .onEach { println(it) }\n    .launchIn(viewModelScope)\n\ndelay(500)\n\nstateFlow.value = 0\n\ndelay(1_000L)\n\n// collect 2\nstateFlow\n    .onEach { println(it) }\n    .launchIn(viewModelScope)\n\ndelay(500)\nstateFlow.value = 1\ndelay(500)\nstateFlow.value = 2\n\n\n이 코드의 실행 결과는 아래와 같다.\n0(first) 0(reaply) 1(new) 1(new) 2(new) 2(new)\n이에 대한 도식화 결과가 다음과 같다.\n\n\nStateFlow를 좀 더 알아보면\nStateFlow는 내부에서 private val _state = atomic(initialState) // T | NULL을 활용하여 처리하고 있다. atomic은 멀티 스레드 환경에서 하나의 변수에 대한 동시 접근 시 데이터의 일관성을 보장하기 위한 메커니즘이 적용되어 있다.\nAndroid 개발에서 가장 많이 활용하고 있는 StateFlow는 atomic 적용되어 있기 때문에 Thread safe를 보장한다.\n다른 이야기지만 일부 아키텍처 패턴 글에 해당 패턴을 사용하면 Thread safe라는 표현을 쓰는 경우가 있다. StateFlow를 기본 사용하는 경우는 어떤 아키텍처 패턴을 쓰던 StateFlow가 thread safe를 제공하는 것이지 해당 패턴에서 thread safe를 지켜주었다는 표현은 잘못된 표현이다.\n그리고 값을 update 하는 경우는 2가지 기법을 활용할 수 있다.\n\nval stateFlow = MutableStateFlow(0)\n\n// update 사용하는 케이스\nstateFlow.update { newValue }\n\n// setValue\nstateFlow.value = newValue\n\n\n각각에 대한 내부 코드를 조금 살펴보면\n\n// update 함수\npublic inline fun <T> MutableStateFlow<T>.update(function: (T) -> T) {\n    while (true) {\n        val prevValue = value\n        val nextValue = function(prevValue)\n        if (compareAndSet(prevValue, nextValue)) {\n            return\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// property setValue\npublic override var value: T\n    get() = NULL.unbox(_state.value)\n    set(value) { updateState(null, value ?: NULL) }\n\n\nupdate 함수는 compareAndSet을 호출하고 있고, setValue는 updateState()를 호출하고 있지만 사실 둘 다 updateState 함수를 호출하고 있다.\n\noverride fun compareAndSet(expect: T, update: T): Boolean =\n    updateState(expect ?: NULL, update ?: NULL)\n\n\nupdate를 쓰나 property .value를 바로 바꾸나 둘 다 thread safe 하게 값을 변경한다는 점이다.\n\nprivate fun updateState(expectedState: Any?, newState: Any): Boolean {\n    // 생략\n    synchronized(this) {\n        // 생략\n    }\n    \n    while (true) {\n        // 생략\n        synchronized(this) {\n            // 생략\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nSharedFlow\n이번엔 SharedFlow이다.

        "contentSnippet": "ARM과 Intel 프로세서의 차이를 이해하고, 아키텍처, 성능, 소프트웨어 호환성, 전력 효율성 등 주요 비교 포인트를 통해 어떤 프로세서가 적합한지 알아보세요.\n\n\n \n 컴퓨터와 스마트폰을 비롯한 전자기기의 핵심 부품인 프로세서는 우리가 사용하는 기술의 성능과 효율성을 좌우하는 중요한 요소입니다. 이 중에서도 ARM과 Intel은 각기 다른 설계 철학과 기술로 시장을 주도하며, 전 세계의 다양한 기기에서 사용되고 있습니다. 특히, 최근 ARM 기반 프로세서가 애플 실리콘과 같은 혁신적인 기술을 선보이며 노트북 시장에서도 두각을 나타내고 있어 관심이 높아지고 있습니다.\n \n그렇다면 ARM과 Intel은 정확히 무엇이 다를까요? 그리고 어떤 프로세서가 여러분의 용도에 더 적합할까요? 이 글에서는 두 프로세서의 주요 차이점과 장단점을 살펴보며, 어떤 선택이 최적인지에 대해 알아보겠습니다.  ️\n \n \n  ARM과 Intel 프로세서: 차이와 선택 기준\n전자제품의 핵심 부품인 프로세서는 기술적 차이가 사용 목적과 성능에 큰 영향을 미칩니다. 특히, ARM과 Intel은 각기 다른 설계 철학과 시장 점유율을 가지고 있어 비교할 가치가 있습니다.\n \n  1. 아키텍처 설계 차이\n\n\n \n ARM 프로세서는 RISC(Reduced Instruction Set Computing) 철학을 기반으로 설계됩니다. RISC는 간단한 명령어 세트를 사용하여 하나의 명령어를 한 번의 클럭 주기로 실행할 수 있습니다. 이로 인해 에너지 소모가 적고, 발열이 낮아 모바일 기기에서 선호됩니다. ARM의 설계는 경량화된 하드웨어를 지원하며, 이는 스마트폰, 태블릿, 사물인터넷(IoT) 기기 등에 최적화된 구조입니다.\n \nIntel 프로세서는 CISC(Complex Instruction Set Computing) 철학을 기반으로 하며, 복잡한 명령어 세트를 통해 다수의 작업을 하나의 명령어로 처리할 수 있습니다. 이러한 구조는 다목적성에서 유리하며, 특히 PC와 서버에서의 복잡한 워크로드를 처리하는 데 적합합니다. Intel은 최신 기술로 복잡한 명령어를 단순화하여 처리 속도와 효율성을 높이는 방식도 도입했습니다.\n \n하지만 현대 프로세서 설계는 RISC와 CISC의 경계를 허물고 있습니다. Intel은 RISC의 장점을 일부 채택했고, ARM은 고성능 코어 설계를 통해 복잡한 연산도 지원하기 시작했습니다. 결과적으로 두 아키텍처의 차이는 점점 줄어들고 있습니다.\n \n  2. 소프트웨어 호환성과 지원\n\n\n \n 프로세서 선택에서 소프트웨어 호환성은 매우 중요한 요소입니다. Intel의 x86 아키텍처는 데스크톱 및 서버 시장에서 널리 사용되며, 수십 년간 구축된 광범위한 소프트웨어 생태계의 이점을 누리고 있습니다. Windows, Linux, macOS 등 주요 운영체제와 대다수의 데스크톱 소프트웨어는 x86 기반으로 개발되어 있습니다.\n \nARM 프로세서는 스마트폰과 태블릿 시장에서 강세를 보이며, Android와 iOS 환경에서 널리 사용됩니다. 그러나 노트북 시장에서 ARM 기반 프로세서가 점점 확대되면서, 소프트웨어 호환성이 도전 과제가 되고 있습니다. Apple의 M 시리즈 칩은 Rosetta 2와 같은 에뮬레이션 기술을 통해 기존 Intel 기반 소프트웨어를 실행하지만, 성능 저하와 비호환성 문제를 해결해야 합니다.\n \n특히, Windows on ARM 환경은 지속적으로 개선되고 있지만, 일부 앱은 여전히 x86 에뮬레이션에 의존해야 합니다. 이는 성능 저하와 버그를 유발할 수 있습니다. 장기적으로 ARM이 더 많은 소프트웨어 지원을 확보한다면, 데스크톱 시장에서도 경쟁력을 높일 가능성이 큽니다.\n \n  3. 성능 비교\n\n\n \n Intel 프로세서는 고성능 워크로드에서 여전히 강점을 보입니다. 멀티스레드 작업, 게이밍, 영상 편집, CAD 설계 및 가상화 등 많은 작업에서 Intel의 x86 아키텍처는 뛰어난 성능을 발휘합니다. 이는 오랜 기간에 걸쳐 개발된 최적화된 소프트웨어와 명령어 세트의 결과입니다.\n \nARM 프로세서는 효율성을 중심으로 발전하고 있습니다. Apple의 M1 및 M2 칩은 높은 성능과 전력 효율성을 동시에 제공하며, 데스크톱 시장에서도 주목받고 있습니다. ARM은 간단한 명령어 세트를 통해 특정 워크로드에서 탁월한 성능을 발휘하며, 배터리 지속 시간이 중요한 환경에서 특히 유리합니다.\n \n향후 ARM 기반 소프트웨어 최적화가 지속된다면, 특정 작업에서 Intel의 성능을 넘어서게 될 가능성도 있습니다. 그러나 다중 스레드 환경과 복잡한 작업에서는 여전히 Intel 프로세서가 앞서 있습니다.\n \n  4. 전력 효율성\n\n\n \n ARM 프로세서는 전력 소비 면에서 x86보다 유리합니다. RISC 설계 철학 덕분에, ARM 프로세서는 에너지를 덜 소모하고 발열이 적어 모바일 기기와 노트북에서 이상적인 선택으로 평가받고 있습니다. Apple Silicon 칩은 전력 효율성 면에서 특히 주목할 만하며, 배터리 수명 연장에 크게 기여합니다.\n \nIntel도 하이브리드 CPU 아키텍처와 마이크로 오퍼레이션 최적화를 통해 전력 효율성을 높이고 있습니다. 그러나 ARM의 자연스러운 효율성에는 미치지 못하며, 여전히 더 높은 전력 소비와 발열을 보이는 경우가 많습니다.\n \n \nARM vs. Intel: 나에게 맞는 프로세서는?\n노트북 사용자: 긴 배터리 지속 시간과 낮은 발열이 중요하다면 ARM 기반 프로세서가 적합합니다.\n데스크톱 사용자: 고성능 작업, 멀티스레드 연산, 게이밍 등을 중시한다면 Intel 또는 AMD의 x86 프로세서가 더 나은 선택입니다.\n모바일 기기: 스마트폰과 태블릿에서는 ARM이 절대적인 우위를 점하고 있습니다.\n\n\n \n ARM과 Intel은 각기 다른 장점과 단점을 가지고 있으며, 기술의 발전에 따라 두 플랫폼의 격차는 점점 줄어들고 있습니다. 사용 목적과 우선순위를 고려하여 적합한 프로세서를 선택하세요!",

클라이언트가 원래 요청한 특정 키에 바인딩된 값\n리스가 유효할 때만 클라이언트가 Memcache에 데이터를 다시 쓸 수 있다.\n리스를 통해 동시 데이터 업데이트로 인한 불일치를 방지하고, 여러 클라이언트가 같은 데이터를 동시에 수정하는 문제를 해결\n결과:\n캐시 세트가 발생하는 것을 방지하여 데이터 일관성 유지.\n스램 문제를 해결해 데이터베이스 부하를 감소시킴.\n 💡 예시\n    Facebook에서 사용자가 피드를 로드할 때, 각 게시물의 좋아요 수를 Memcache에서 캐시하고 있다. 여러 사용자가 동일한 게시물을 동시에 좋아요를 눌렀다면, 좋아요 수를 업데이트하려는 여러 요청이 동시에 들어오게 될 수 있다.\n리스가 없는 경우 (문제 발생):\n사용자 A와 사용자 B가 동시에 같은 게시물에 대해 좋아요를 누른다.\n두 사용자가 Memcache에서 캐시된 좋아요 수를 조회하고, 캐시 미스가 발생하여 데이터베이스에서 값을 가져온다.\n데이터베이스에서 가져온 값은 기존 값이고, 두 사용자가 동시에 좋아요 수를 증가시킨다.\n두 사용자가 각각 Memcache에 업데이트를 하게 되면, 최신 상태의 데이터가 아니므로 일관성이 깨지게 된다.\n리스 적용 후 (문제 해결)\n사용자 A가 첫 번째로 Memcache에서 캐시된 좋아요 수를 조회.\nMemcache는 좋아요 수를 새로 갱신할 수 있는 리스 토큰을 사용자 A에게 할당.\n사용자 A는 해당 데이터를 갱신하고, 리스 토큰을 이용해 Memcache에 값을 설정.\n사용자 B가 동일한 게시물의 좋아요 수를 조회할 때, 이미 리스 토큰이 만료되지 않은 사용자 A에게만 데이터 갱신 권한이 있기 때문에, 사용자 B는 데이터를 다시 가져와 갱신을 시도할 수 없다.\n사용자 B는 새로운 리스 토큰을 요청하고, 사용자 A의 갱신 작업이 완료되면 데이터베이스에서 최신 값을 가져와 업데이트.\n결과\n리스 메커니즘 덕분에 사용자 A만 해당 데이터를 갱신할 수 있으며, 사용자 B는 갱신 권한을 얻기 전까지 기다린다.\n이를 통해 데이터 일관성을 유지하고, 스램 문제를 해결하며, 데이터베이스 부하도 줄인다.\nMemcache Pools\nMemcache 서버는 여러 워크로드(작업 부하)를 처리할 수 있지만, 서로 다른 데이터 접근 패턴과 메모리 사용량을 가진 워크로드가 한 풀 안에서 상호작용하면 성능이 저하될 수 있다.\n예를 들어, 자주 변경되는 데이터와 드물게 접근되는 데이터가 같은 Memcache 풀에 있으면, 자주 변경되는 데이터로 인해 드물게 접근되는 데이터가 메모리에서 지워질 수 있다.\nMemcache 풀:\nMemcache 서버를 여러 개의 별도 풀로 나누어 사용\nwildcard pool: 일반적인 캐시 데이터를 저장. 자주 업데이트되지 않는 데이터\napp-specific pool: 자주 변하는 데이터를 저장.\nreplicated pool: 읽기 요청이 많은 데이터를 저장.\nregional pool: 지역적 특성이 있는 데이터를 저장.\n결과:\n서로 다른 데이터를 분리하여 풀에 저장함으로써, 각 데이터 유형에 맞는 최적화된 메모리 관리와 성능 향상을 이끌어낼 수 있다\n서로 다른 데이터 유형이 메모리 풀 간섭 없이 저장되므로, 성능이 향상되고 효율적인 메모리 사용이 가능\nReplication\n특정 키가 자주 요청되는 경우, 여러 Memcache 서버에 복제본을 만들어 데이터 접근 시간을 단축시키는 기법\n복제된 데이터를 여러 Memcache 서버에 분산 저장하여, 읽기 요청이 한 서버에 몰리는 것을 방지.\n데이터베이스 요청이 많아지는 시점에 복제를 통해 다중 서버에서 동시에 데이터 제공이 가능\n📌 글로벌 확장\nMemcache 시스템이 글로벌 사용자에게 안정적이고 빠른 서비스를 제공하였나\n지역 기반 설계:\nfacebook은 글로벌 사용자에게 빠르고 일관된 응답을 제공하기 위해, Memcache를 지역별로 분산하여 배치\n지역 단위로 캐시 데이터를 관리하고, 서버 간의 데이터 전파 시간을 줄여 응답 시간을 최적화\n각 지역별 클러스터:\nFacebook은 지역별 클러스터를 구성하여, 서버들이 같은 지역 내에서만 통신하도록 설계.\n예를 들어, 북미, 유럽, 아시아 등 각 대륙별로 독립적인 Memcache 클러스터를 운영.\n각 지역에 서버를 배치하여, 사용자 요청이 발생할 때 가장 가까운 서버에서 데이터를 처리하도록 하여 응답 시간을 최소화.\n글로벌 서버 분산:\n데이터는 여러 서버에 복제되어 저장. 각 지역에 복제된 데이터를 두어, 한 지역에서 장애가 발생하더라도 다른 지역에서 백업 데이터를 빠르게 사용할 수 있게 된다.\n클러스터 분할 (Sharding) : 효율적인 확장\n샤딩은 Memcache 서버를 여러 개의 작은 서브 클러스터로 나누는 방식으로, 각 클러스터가 데이터의 일부분만 담당하도록 한다.\n데이터 일관성 (Data Consistency) : 다양한 지역에 배포된 서버들이 동일한 데이터를 제공. \n캐시 일관성 유지\nFacebook은 일관성 있는 데이터를 보장하기 위해 원격 캐시 및 데이터 동기화 전략을 사용.\n각 서버가 다른 지역에 있는 서버들과 주기적으로 데이터를 동기화하여, 최신 데이터를 여러 지역에서 동일하게 제공.\n데이터베이스에서 변경된 사항은 캐시에서 무효화된 후, 새로 갱신된 데이터를 다시 캐시로 가져오는 방식으로 일관성을 유지.\n데이터 전파 및 복제\n데이터베이스의 변경 사항은 복제된 Memcache 서버에 자동으로 전파.\n동기 복제 또는 비동기 복제 방식을 사용하여 각 지역 서버에 실시간 데이터 동기화를 구현.\n📌 단일 서버 개선 사항\n멀티스레드 구현\nAdaptive Slab Allocator 적용\nMemcache 서버에서 메모리를 고정 크기 블록으로 할당할 경우, 메모리 낭비가 발생할 수 있음. 특히 작은 크기의 데이터나 자주 변하는 데이터에 대해서는 비효율적인 메모리 사용이 문제이다.\n메모리 할당을 동적으로 최적화\n작은 데이터는 작은 크기의 슬랩을 사용하고, 큰 데이터는 더 큰 슬랩을 할당하여 메모리 사용 효율을 높임\nLRU(Least Recently Used) 캐시 정책 개선\nMemcache는 기본적으로 LRU(Least Recently Used) 정책을 사용하여 오래된 데이터를 삭제하고 새로운 데이터를 저장하는 방식으로 동작 → 데이터 삭제가 발생할 때 불필요한 연산이 발생\nLRU 알고리즘을 개선하여 캐시의 유효성을 최적화하고, 불필요한 삭제를 최소화\n비동기 요청 처리 도입\n네트워크 지연 시간 감소\n메모리 효율성 향상\n그래서 Redis랑 어떤차이가 있는 건데? 🤔\n데이터 구조\nRedis: 다양한 데이터 구조를 지원.\n문자열 (String)\n리스트 (List)\n집합 (Set)\n정렬된 집합 (Sorted Set)\n해시 (Hash)\n비트맵, 하이퍼로그로그 등 고급 자료 구조\n\n이를 통해 복잡한 데이터 연산을 인메모리에서 처리할 수 있다.\nMemcached:\n단순히 key-value 쌍의 데이터를 문자열 또는 바이너리 형태로 저장.\n\n구조가 간단하여 캐싱 이외의 복잡한 작업에는 부적합.\n영속성 (Persistence)\nRedis:데이터 영속성을 지원.\nRDB (주기적으로 데이터 덤프)\nAOF (명령 로그 기록)\n\n캐시로뿐만 아니라 데이터베이스로도 활용 가능.\nMemcached:영속성을 지원하지 않는다.\n\n메모리가 날아가면 데이터도 손실.\n클러스터링 (Clustering)\nRedis:Redis 클러스터를 통해 샤딩과 복제를 지원.\n\n확장성이 높으며, 고가용성을 위한 설정이 가능합니다.\nMemcached:\n클러스터링을 자체적으로 지원하지 않는다.\n\n클라이언트 라이브러리를 사용해 샤딩 구현.\n성능\nRedis:\n다양한 데이터 구조와 기능으로 인해 특정 상황에서 오버헤드가 발생할 수 있습니다.\n하지만 대부분의 경우 성능은 매우 뛰어나다.\nMemcached:\n단순한 구조 덕분에 읽기/쓰기 성능이 매우 빠르다.\n\n단순 캐싱 용도라면 Redis보다 약간 더 나은 성능을 보일 수 있다.\n사례\nRedis: 세션 관리, 실시간 분석 (e.g., 순위, 카운터), 메시지 큐, Pub/Sub 시스템, 복잡한 데이터 구조 캐싱\nMemcached:단순 데이터 캐싱, 웹 페이지 렌더링 속도 개선,자주 변경되지 않는 데이터 저장\n메모리 관리\nRedis:\nLRU(Least Recently Used) 정책으로 메모리 관리.\n사용자가 메모리 사용량을 세부적으로 제어 가능.\nMemcached:\n메모리 블록 단위로 데이터를 저장하며, 메모리 초과 시 오래된 데이터를 자동 삭제.\n정리하자면, \nRedis는 다양한 데이터 구조와 영속성을 지원하며, 데이터베이스나 메시지 브로커 등으로도 활용 가능. 복잡한 작업에 적합하다.\nMemcached는 단순한 데이터 캐싱에 특화되어 있으며, 빠르고 가볍다\n논문 링크 : https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi13/nsdi13-final170_update.pdf",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "나도 몇 번 포스팅 한 적이 있고, 요새도 아주 가끔 읽는 사토시 나카모토의 비트코인 백서는 2008년 10월 31일 발행됐고, 비트코인 자체는 2009년에 이 세상에 처음 소개됐다고 하는 게 맞을 것 같다. 당시 비트코인 가격은 0원이었다. 최초의 비트코인 랠리는 2010년 10월, 가격이 $0.10에서 $0.20으로 두 배 올라가면서 시작했고, 그 이후로 엄청난 up/down을 거쳤다.\n<이미지 출처: Perplexity 검색 결과>\n위의 차트는 비트코인 탄생 이후부터 지난주까지의 가격 변동을 보여주는데, 시간을 압축해서 15년을 하나의 차트로 보면 지속적인 우상향 그래프가 보이지만, 현미경으로 3개월이나 6개월 단위로 차트를 쪼개서 보면 그래프가 미친 듯이 위아래로 요동을 친다. 나는 2013년도부터 비트코인에 대해서 제대로 알게 됐고, 이때 코빗에 우리가 투자하면서 개인적으로도 비트코인과 다른 디지털자산에 관심을 가지면서 지금까지 소량의 비트코인을 꾸준히 사고 있다.\n우리가 하는 초기 투자가 워낙 시간, 복리, 그리고 인내심의 함수라서 그런지, 그리고 내 성향 자체가 뭔가를 그냥 꾸준히 하는 편이라서 그런지, 나는 주식 투자도 사는 전략만 구사하지, 파는 전략을 실행하는 경우는 거의 없다. 내가 지금 보유하고 있는 상장 회사 주식도 몇 종류가 안 되는데, 이 주식 중 정말 오래 보유하고 있는 건, 24년째 보유하고 있다. 더 재미있는 건, 이 주식은 중간에 한 번도 팔지 않고, 24년째 계속 사고만 있다.\n비트코인도 나는 아마도 아주 오랜 시간 동안 long and hold 전략을 구사할 것 같다. 내가 비트코인을 보유했던 지난 11년 동안 수천만 명 ~ 수억 명의 사람들이 비트코인은 망할 거라고 했고, 너무 많은 사람들이 그때마다 팔았고, 다시 반등하면 또 너무 많은 사람들이 비트코인을 샀다. 그럴 때마다 가격은 출렁거렸고, 정말 그때 순간순간을 생각해 보면 나도 인내심과 뚝심이 없었다면 아마도 어느 순간 모든 걸 다 팔았을 것이다. 실은 당시엔 이렇게 하고 싶은 유혹이 있었지만, 원칙이라고 하기엔 좀 개똥이지만, 내가 그동안 배우고 느낀 것들을 기반으로 세운 두 가지 원칙 때문에 계속 보유했고, 가격이 내려가면 오히려 좋은 자산을 할인된 가격에 살 수 있는 기회라고 생각하고 더 샀다.\n첫 번째 원칙은, 비트코인 자체에 대한 믿음이었다. 처음엔 그냥 재미로 샀고, 그 이후엔 계속 가격이 올라가니까 욕심 때문에 추가 구매했다. 그 기간 나는 공부도 많이 했고, 관련 회사도 많이 만났고, 투자도 하면서 이 신기한 신기루 같은 코드로 만든 인터넷 돈에 대한 호기심과 경외심이 생겼다. 그래서 가격이 폭락하고 남들이 다 팔고, 이제 비트코인은 망했다는 소리가 여기저기서 들릴 때 오히려 더 샀다. 워렌버핏의 “남이 욕심부릴 때 두려워하고, 남이 두려워할 때 욕심부려라.”라는 말을 워낙 좋아하기도 해서일 것이다.\n두 번째 원칙은, 내 인생철학이기도 하다. 인생의 모든 좋은 것은 시간이 아주 오래 걸린다는 것이다. 여기엔 인내심, 시간, 복리, 꾸준함 등이 모두 포함되어 있다.\n\n\n\n\n그런데 솔직히 나는 현재 비트코인으로 돈을 번 것도 아니고 잃은 것도 아니다. 왜냐하면 아직 팔지 않았기 때문에, 이익도 없고 손실도 없는 상태이다.\n어쨌든 이런 여러 가지 고민, 욕심, 두려움, 인내심이 지난 11년 동안 소위 말하는 뚝심이 됐고, 이 뚝심은 비트코인뿐만 아니라 내 인생 모든 것에 적용되고 있다.\nTech 시장만 봐도 매번 이런 열풍이 불 때마다 우린 과한 버블을 목격한다. 비트코인은 말할 필요도 없고, 그 이후에 왔던 ICO, NFT, 메타버스 등, 모두 다 the next big thing을 꿈꾸면서 여기저기 옮겨 가기에 바쁘다. 그리고 이렇게 옮길 때마다 매번 하는 말은 “이건 좀 다르다. 이번엔 확실하다.”인데, 솔직히 이런 말 하는 사람치고 그 분야에 2년 이상 있는 사람을 못 봤다. 유행이 지나고, 투자자들의 관심이 다른 곳으로 가고, 쉽게 돈 벌 수 있는 분위기가 다른 곳으로 가면, 다시 또 그 새로운 분야에서 얄팍한 지식을 쌓은 후에 마치 전문가 행세를 하면서 이게 next big thing이고, 이 분야에서 뼈를 묻을 것처럼 행동한다.\nAI 시장에도 비슷한 양상이 보인다. 요새 ‘AI’라는 단어가 안 들어간 자료를 본 적이 없다. 다들 AI First 전략을 구사하고, 마치 반복적인 일을 하는 직업은 모두 다 바로 사라질 것처럼 호들갑을 떨고 있다. 그리고 똑같은 말들을 한다. 과거에 반짝했다가 크게 안 된 메타버스나 NFT와는 좀 다르다고. 뭐가 다르냐고 물어보면 그냥 대부분 “이게 새로운 미래입니다.”라는 영혼 없는 답변들을 한다. 하지만, 역시 대중은 잘 속고, 인류 자체가 건망증의 연속인 것 같다. 모든 관심도 돈은 AI에 몰리고 있다. 나도 AI가 대단하고 이렇게 빨리 바뀌는 기술이 과거에 있었겠느냐는 경외심을 갖고 있는데, 그렇다고 이것만 이 세상에 존재하는 기술과 사업일 것이라는 생각은 하지 않는다.\n내가 봤을 때, 유행 쫓기의 일인자들은 VC들이다. 뭔가 유행할 때마다, 이 분야의 전문가 행사를 하고, 이 특정 분야에만 투자하는 펀드를 만드는 사람들이 우리다. 이러다 보니 창업가들도 돈을 받기 위해서는 이 분야에서 창업하거나, 전혀 상관없는 사업을 이 분야랑 엮으려고 한다. 여기에 또 속아 넘어가는 투자자들이 있고, 어쨌든 이 역사는 계속 반복되는 것 같다.\n지금 AI를 종교같이 믿고 있는 많은 분들 중 5년, 10년 뒤에도 이 믿음을 가진 분들이 몇 명이나 될까? 과연 이 세상에 뚝심이라는 건 존재할까?\n그래도 아직 존재하는 것 같다. 결국엔 이런 사람들이 잘 되는 걸 나는 이제 목격하고 경험하기 시작했다. 그만큼 모든 좋은 건 오래 걸린다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "요새 창업가들에게 참 힘든 시기이다. 나도 이 블로그에서 좋지 않은 경기에 대해서 너무 오랫동안, 그리고 너무 많이 포스팅했고, 내가 이런 글을 쓰지 않아도 모든 창업가들과 투자자들은 지난 2년 동안 매일 직접 몸으로 이 현실을 체험하고 있다.\n나는 이 어려운 시기에 VC라는 업에 대해서 더 많이 생각하고, 고민하고, 그리고 이 업의 본질에 대해서 배우고 있어서, 힘들지만, 오히려 더 의미 있고 보람찬 시간을 보내고 있다. 아무것도 모를 적엔, VC라는 업은 그냥 스타트업에 투자만 잘하면 되는거라고 생각했다. 물론, 투자에서 가장 중요한 건, 종류를 막론하고 좋은 투자 대상을 발굴해서 좋은 조건에 투자하는 것이다. 결국 여기서 모든 게 시작되니까. 하지만, 최근 몇 년 동안 배우면서 느끼는 건, VC라는 업의 진짜 본질은 투자한 회사가 어려울 때, 그 회사와 같이 싸우고, 경영진들과 같이 고민하고, 해결하기 힘든 문제에 대한 해답을 같이 찾는 것이라는 점이다. 실은, 투자하는 건 VC의 업무 중 가장 쉽고, 누구나 다 할 수 있지만, 이 회사들이 망가지거나, 힘든 상황을 겪고 있을 때 – 그리고 투자를 해본 사람들은 누구나 다 안다. 힘들지 않거나, 망가지지 않는 스타트업은 없다는 걸 – 같이 이 문제를 해결하기 위해서 고민하고 노력하는 게 가장 어렵고, 오히려 더 중요한 VC의 업무라고 생각한다. 그 누구도 남이 듣기 싫어하는 소리를 하고, 남이 건드리지 않는 똥을 치우고 싶진 않지만, VC의 본질은 바로 이런 일을 솔선수범해서 하는 것이다.\n그런데 이게 굉장히 힘든 일이다. 실은 내가 아는 대부분의 VC는 이런 궂은일을 안 하려고 한다. 세월이 좋고, 회사가 잘 되면 모두 다 본인들이 잘 투자했고, 잘 관리했고, 그리고 그 회사를 “키웠다”라고 너도나도 한마디씩 하지만, 아주 골치 아픈 일이 발생하면 너도나도 모른척하고 도망가기에 바쁘다. 이게 사람의 습성이고, VC라고 다르지 않다. 우리도 투자사에 골치 아픈 일이 발생하면 그냥 모른척하고, 미루고, 도망가고 싶지만, 이렇게 하는 건 그 누구에게도 도움이 안 되고, 결국엔 우리 스스로 엄청나게 후회하는 결과가 발생할 것이라는 걸 너무 잘 알기 때문에, 그냥 정면 돌파를 시도한다. 정면 돌파는 참 괴롭고 힘들지만, 하다 보면 문제가 잘 해결되는 운 좋은 경우도 있고, 잘 안되더라도 기분이 찜찜하진 않다.\n회사의 대표도 이런 비장한 마음이고, 투자사이자 이사회 멤버인 우리도 비장한 마음으로 정면 돌파를 시도하는 아주 골치 아픈 이슈가 요새 하나 있다. 실은, 나도 이렇게 골치가 아픈데, 우리 투자사 대표는 오죽하겠나. 이분과 이런 회사 이야기를 하면, 그렇게 어려운 일을 많이 겪은 분도 요새 스트레스가 커서, 이 불안한 마음을 가라앉히기 위해 여러 가지 새로운 시도를 하고 있는데 집에서 시간 날 때마다 지구본을 본다고 한다.\n파란 구슬 같은 지구본을 보면서 스스로에게 이 거대한 우주 속에 지구는 정말 작은 구슬 같은 존재이고, 이 작은 지구에서 본인은 정말 작은 점 같은 존재이고, 이 작은 점의 걱정과 고민은 정말 아무것도 아니라는 최면을 스스로에게 건다고 한다. 이렇게 몇 번 지구본을 보면서 스스로에게 이런 위안을 하면, 그나마 불안이 조금 사라지면서 다시 지옥 같은 현실을 직면할 수 있는 용기가 생긴다고 한다.\n이후에 나도 불안과 스트레스가 너무 크면, 지구본을 보면서 “나는 이 지구상에 점과 같은 존재다. 점과 같은 존재가 느끼는 불안과 스트레스는 정말 아무것도 아니다.”라는 말을 스스로에게 몇 번 해봤는데, 솔직히 나한테는 그렇게 큰 도움이 되진 않는 것 같다. 불안, 스트레스, 그리고 고민의 크기는 상대적이고, 그 크기와는 상관없이 우리 모두 매 순간 우리만의 크고 작은 전쟁을 치르고 있다. 누군가는 나에게 “우크라이나랑 중동에선 매일 사람들이 죽고 있고, 그 사람들의 불안과 스트레스에 비하면 너는 아무것도 아닌데, 뭘 그렇게 걱정하냐?”라고 물어볼 수 있지만, 나에게는 지금 이 시점에 나한테 닥친 고민이 세상에서 제일 큰 고민거리고, 내가 싸워야 하는 나만의 생사가 걸린 전쟁이다. 하지만, 위에서 말 한, 큰 세상의 작은 점 하나가 겪는 더 작은 시련이라는 관점에서 나의 불안을 바라보는 건 스트레스 완화를 위한 괜찮은 방법의 하나인 것 같다. 계속 연습하고 스스로에게 주문을 외워야 한다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "블로그에 글을 오랜만에 쓴다. 요즘 공부한 대부분의 내용은 개인 옵시디언에 작성하고 있어서, 블로그 같이 공개적인 공간에 글을 발행할 일이 없었는데, 의식적으로 블로그에도 글을 써보려 해야겠다.\n최근에 Redlock 알고리즘에 대해서 가볍게 공부했는데, 이 내용을 정리해본다.\n\n분산 락이 보장해야하는 속성\n레디스 공식 문서에서는 아래와 같이 분산락이 보장해야하는 3가지 속성에 대해 제시한다.\n상호 배제 (Mutual Exclusion) : 특정 시점에 하나의 클라이언트만 락을 획득할 수 있어야 함\n교착 상태 없음 (Deadlock Free) : 먼저 락을 획득한 클라이언트가 장애(다운, 네트워크 단절 등)가 발생하더라도 락을 획득할 수 있어야 함\n내결함성 (Fault Tolerance) : Redis 노드의 과반수가 동작중이라면 클라이언트는 락을 획득/해제가 가능해야함\nRedlock 알고리즘은 어떻게 위 3가지 요건을 만족했는지 알아보자.\n\nRedlock 등장 배경\nRedlock 알고리즘이 어떤 문제를 해결하기 위해 등장했는지, Redlock 등장 이전의 분산락 구현 방식과 그 문제점을 알아보자.\n\n1. 단일 Redis 인스턴스의 문제\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    출처 : https://www.baeldung.com/cs/distributed-systems-prevent-single-point-failure\n  \nRedis 를 사용해서 락을 구현하는 가장 간단한 방법은 단일 Redis 인스턴스를 구성하는 방법이다. 락을 획득하고자 하는 클라이언트는 단일 Redis 인스턴스에서 키를 생성하고 TTL을 설정한다. 이 상태에서 다른 클라이언트가 락을 획득하려하면, 이미 해당 키가 설정되어 있으므로 실패한다. 이후 임계 영역 (Critical Section) 에서 작업을 마친 클라이언트는, 자신이 Redis 에 설정했던 키를 제거하여 락을 해제한다.\nRedis는 기본적으로 싱글 쓰레드로 동작 하기 때문에, 분산 환경에서의 경합을 크게 고려하지 않고도 간단하게 분산락을 구현할 수 있다.\n하지만, 문제는 단일 Redis 인스턴스는 단일 장애점(Single Point of Failure) 이라는 점이다. Redis 인스턴스에서 장애가 발생해 죽어버리면, 어떤 클라이언트도 임계 영역에서 작업을 수행할 수 없게 된다. 곤란한 일이다.\n\n2. Master-Slave 복제 아키텍처의 문제\n단일 Redis 인스턴스는 앞서 알아보았듯, 단일 장애점으로 인한 가용성 문제가 존재한다. 그렇다면, Master-Slave 복제 아키텍처를 사용하여 가용성을 높이는 방법을 사용하면 어떨까? 좋은 아이디어 같아 보인다. 적용해보자.\nMaster-Slave 로 Redis 를 구성했는데, 어느날 Master 노드에 장애가 발생했다. 다행히 Failover 메커니즘에 의해 Slave 가 Master 로 승격되면서, 장애는 빠르게 회복되었다. 그런데, 이상한 현상이 발생하였다. 장애가 발생한 당시, 2개의 클라이언트가 동시에 리소스에 접근하여 동시성 이슈가 발생한 것이었다. 왜 이런일이 발생했을까?\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    출처 : https://medium.com/@anil.goyal0057/distributed-locking-mechanism-using-redis-26c17d9f3d5f\n  \n이 문제는 Redis 의 복제 방식으로 인해 발생한다. Redis 는 비동기 복제 방식을 사용한다. 아래와 같은 시나리오를 생각해보자.\nClient A가 마스터에서 락을 획득함\nMaster에서 키에 대한 쓰기가 발생했지만, Slave로 복제되기 전에 마스터 노드가 다운됨\nSlave 노드가 새로운 Master로 승격됨\nClient B가 새로운 마스터로부터 락을 획득함\n이와 같은 상황을 복제 지연으로 인한 쓰기 유실 (Write Loss) 이라고 부른다. 이런 쓰기 유실이 발생한다면, 서로 다른 두 클라이언트가 동시에 임계 영역에 진입해 상호 배제 원칙이 위배될 수 있다.\nRedis 의 WAIT 명령을 사용하면 해결할 수 있을 것 같지만, WAIT 을 사용하다고 하더라도 동기 복제를 완전히 보장하지 않는다. WAIT 은 쓰기 명령이 Replica 로 도달하여 ACK 응답을 받은 시점 까지만 보장하며, 실제로 Replica 에 정상적으로 데이터가 쓰여지는 것 까지 보장하지 않는다. 또한 WAIT 에 timeout 을 설정하면, 일정 시간동안 ACK 응답을 받지 못했을 때, ACK 응답을 기다리는 것을 포기하고 다음 명령을 실행한다.\n즉, WAIT 을 사용하더라도 여전히 쓰기 유실이 발생할 가능성은 존재한다.\n\nRedlock 의 등장\n앞서 알아본 것 처럼, 단일 인스턴스를 사용하던 Master-Slave 복제 아키텍처 방식을 사용하던 Redis 는 높은 수준의 신뢰성을 제공하지 않는다. Redlock 을 사용하면, SPOF로 인한 가용성 문제와 복제 지연으로 인한 쓰기 유실 문제를 해결하면서, 안전하게 락을 제공할 수 있다.\n\n    \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    출처 : https://careers.saigontechnology.com/blog-detail/implement-distributed-lock-for-a-microservices-software-system\n  \nRedlock 의 핵심 아이디어는 정족수(Quorum)이다. 정족수란, 회의나 투표가 유효하게 진행되기 위해 필요한 최소한의 참석 인원을 말한다. Redlock 에서도 이 의미는 동일하게 사용된다.\nRedlock 을 사용하기 위해서는 다수(일반적으로 5개)의 독립적인 (Standalone) Redis 인스턴스가 필요하다. 클라이언트는 이 Redis 노드 모두에게 순차적으로 락을 요청한다. 그리고 정족수(N/2 + 1) 이상의 노드들로부터 락을 획득했다면, 클라이언트는 자신이 락을 획득했다고 간주하고 임계 영역에 진입해 작업을 수행한다.\n일정 수 이상의 노드들로부터 락을 획득하면, 리소스의 락을 획득한 것으로 인정되므로, 일부 노드가 다운된 상태여도 문제 없다. 따라서 가용성 문제와 쓰기 유실 문제를 모두 해결할 수 있다.\nRedlock 을 위해 구성된 Redis 노드들은 같은 클러스터에 참여하거나, 복제를 하는 등 서로 연관되어 있어서는 안되며, 완전히 독립되어야 한다.\n이제 Redlock 알고리즘에 대해서 더 자세히 알아보자.\n\nRedlock 알고리즘\n\n1. 현재 시각을 ms 단위로 가져옴\n이 시간은 락 획득에 걸린 시간을 계산하기 위해 사용된다.\n\n2. 클라이언트는 모든 N개의 마스터 노드로부터 순차적으로 락 획득을 시도\n이떄, 클라이언트는 해당 키에 랜덤한 값을 저장한다. 아래에서 자세히 설명하겠지만, 이 랜덤 값은 락을 획득한 클라이언트만이 해당 락을 해제할 수 있도록 보장한다.\n특정 Redis 노드에 락이 이미 걸려있다면, 즉시 다음 노드로 넘어간다. 이런 상황이 발생했다면, 해당 클라이언트는 다른 클라이언트와 락 획득 경쟁이 발생한 상황일 것이다.\n\n3. 락 설정시 타임아웃을 적용\n클라이언트는 각 Redis 인스턴스에 락을 설정할 때, 한 노드를 너무 오래기다리지 않도록 타임아웃을 설정한다. 예를 들어, TTL이 10초 정도라면, 타임아웃은 5~50ms 정도로 작게 설정한다. 이렇게 하면, Redis 노드가 설령 다운된 상황이라도 오래 기다리지 않고 바로 다음 노드로 넘어갈 수 있다.\n\n4. 락 획득 성공 여부 판단\n클라이언트는 모든 Redis 노드로부터 락 설정 시도를 마치고, 과반수(N/2 + 1) 이상의 인스턴스에서 락을 획득 했는지 확인한다. 과반수 이상의 Redis 노드로부터 락을 설정하는데 성공했다면, 클라이언트는 자신이 락 획득에 성공했다고 판단한다.\n\n5. 락 유효 시간 계산\n클라이언트는 락 유효 시간(Lock Validity Time)을 계산한다. 락 유효 시간은 이름 그대로 락이 유효한 시간을 나타내며, 클라이언트는 락 유효 시간 만큼 임계영역에서 작업을 할 수 있다. 락 유효 시간은 아래와 같이 계산한다.\nLockValidityTime=TTL−(T2−T1)Lock Validity Time = TTL - (T2 - T1)LockValidityTime=TTL−(T2−T1)\n각 변수의 의미는 아래와 같다.\nTTL : Redis 키에 설정된 TTL. 이는 락의 초기 유효 시간을 나타낸다.\nT1 : 최초 노드에서 Key가 SET 된 최악의 시각 (첫번째 노드에 통신하기 전에 얻어온 시각)\nT2 : 마지막 노드에서 Key가 SET 된 최악의 시각 (마지막 노드로부터 응답을 받은 시각)\n(T2−T1)(T2 - T1)(T2−T1) 은 클라이언트가 락을 획득하는 데 소요된 총 시간으로, 이 시간이 길어질수록 실제로 락을 보유할 수 있는 시간이 줄어든다.\n\n6. 락 획득 실패 시 처리\n만약 클라이언트가 락 획득에 실패한 경우, 모든 Redis 인스턴스에서 락을 해제한다.\n\nRedlock 의 실제 구현\n레디스 공식 문서에서는 Redlock 구현 방식을 아래와 같이 제시한다.\n\n1. Redis 명령으로 락 획득\n클라이언트는 아래와 같은 SET 명령을 수행하여 락을 획득한다.\nSET resource_name my_random_value NX PX 30000\n\n\nNX : 키가 존재하지 않을 때만 값을 설정한다.\nPX : 키의 TTL을 밀리세컨드 단위로 설정한다.\n\n2. Lua Script 를 사용하여 락 해제\n락 해제 작업을 Atomic 하게 수행하기 위해, 클라이언트는 아래와 같은 Lua Script 를 실행하여 락을 해제한다.\nif redis.call(\"get\", KEYS[1]) == ARGV[1] then\n\treturn redis.call(\"del\", KEYS[1])\nelse\n\treturn 0\nend\n\n\nKEYS[1] : 해제하려는 락의 Key 를 지정. 여기서는 resource_name 에 해당하는 값을 전달한다.\nARGV[1] : Lua Script 에서 사용할 인자의 값. 여기서는 my_random_value 에 해당하는 값을 전달한다.\n\nmy_random_value 가 무엇인가?\n여기에서 my_random_value 라는 랜덤한 값이 등장한다. 이 값은 락을 획득한 클라이언트만이 락을 해제할 수 있도록 보장하는데 사용된다.\n만약 레디스 키에 대한 DEL 명령을 누구나 실행할 수 있다면, 락을 획득하지 않은 클라이언트가 임의로 락을 해제하고 자신이 락을 획득할 수 있게 되고, 이는 상호 배제의 위반이다.\n이를 방지 하기 위해서, 락을 설정할 때 클라이언트가 랜덤 값을 생성하고, 락 Key의 Value 로 사용한다. 그리고 락을 해제할 때, 자신이 생성한 랜덤 값을 제시해서, 일치하는 경우에만 락을 해제한다 (Lua Script 의 로직). 이는 클라이언트가 락의 소유권을 증명하는 일종의 비밀번호라고 할 수 있다.\n\nRedlock 주의점\n\nClock Drift 문제\nRedlock 알고리즘에서 Redis 노드들 그리고 클라이언트 간에 동기화된 시계 (Synchronized Clock)가 존재하지 않는다. 그리고 Redlock 알고리즘은 참여자간의 로컬 시간이 거의 동일한 속도로 갱신된다는 가정에 의존한다.\n하지만 현실에서는 로컬 시계가 정확한 속도로 동작하지 않는 Clock Drift 현상으로, 시스템 내부 시계가 실제 시간과 불일치하는 현상이 발생할 수 있다. 이런 현상은 하드웨어 문제, 운영체제 스케줄링 문제 등 다양한 원인으로 인해 발생할 수 있다.\n\nClock Drift 발생 시나리오\nClock Drift 현상이 발생하면, 한 Redis 노드에서는 락이 유효하다고 판단하는 반면, 다른 노드에서는 해당 락이 이미 만료되었다고 판단할 수 있다. 예를 들자면, 아래와 같은 시나리오이다.\n5개의 레디스 노드가 존재하고, 3개의 노드에서 락을 획득하면, 락이 유효한 상황\n클라이언트 1은 A, B, C 노드에서 락을 획득했으나, 네트워크 에러로 D와 E 노드에서 실패\n노드 C의 시계가 클럭 드리프트로 인해, 시간이 미래로 점프했고, 조기에 TTL이 만료됨\n이 시점에 클라이언트 2가 C, D, E 에서 락을 획득함\n\nMIN_VALIDITY\n따라서, 클라이언트는 락 유효 시간에서 클럭 드리프트를 보정한 값인 MIN_VALIDITY 를 계산하고, 자신이 획득한 락의 안정성을 판단해야한다.\nMIN_VALIDITY 는 아래와 같이 계산한다.\nMIN_VALIDITY=TTL−(T2−T1)−CLOCK_DRIFTMIN\\_VALIDITY = TTL - (T2 - T1) - CLOCK\\_DRIFTMIN_VALIDITY=TTL−(T2−T1)−CLOCK_DRIFT\n클라이언트는 이와 같이 MIN_VALIDITY 를 계산하고, 아래와 같이 락 안정성에 대해 판단한다.\nMIN_VALIDITY 가 음수거나 너무 짧다면 : 락이 불안정하다고 판단하고, 사용을 중단하거나 락을 해제한다.\nMIN_VALIDITY 가 충분히 크다면 : 락이 안정적이라고 판단하고 작업을 진행한다.\n\nCLOCK_DRIFT 계산\n그렇다면, CLOCK_DRIFT 는 어떻게 계산할까? 일반적으로 CLOCK_DRIFT_FACTOR 라는 값을 활용하여 CLOCK_DRIFT 값을 계산한다. 산식은 아래와 같다.\nCLOCK_DRIFT=TTL∗CLOCK_DRIFT_FACTOR+δCLOCK\\_DRIFT = TTL * CLOCK\\_DRIFT\\_FACTOR + δCLOCK_DRIFT=TTL∗CLOCK_DRIFT_FACTOR+δ\n일반적으로 CLOCK_DRIFT_FACTOR 의 값은 1%로 설정하는데, 이는 네트워크 시간 프로토콜(NTP)을 통한 시계 동기화의 정확도에 기반한다고 한다.\nNTP의 정확도에 대한 연구에 따르면, NTP를 통해 동기화된 시스템 간의 시계 오차는 일반적으로 수 밀리초에서 수십 밀리초 수준으로, 전체 시간의 약 0.01%에서 0.1%에 해당한다고 한다. 따라서, 보수적인 접근으로 1%를 CLOCK_DRIFT_FACTOR 로 설정하여 시계 드리프트를 고려하는 것이 일반적이다.\n\nSplit-brain Condition\n클라이언트가 락을 획득하는데 실패한 경우, 재시도 정책에 따라 락 획득을 재시도할 수 있다. 그런데 만약 재시도 하려는 클라이언트가 많다면, 동시에 재시도 요청이 쇄도하는 Retry Storm 이 발생할 것이다. 이렇게 리소스에 대해 경쟁하면, 계속해서 충돌이 발생하고, 그 어떤 클라이언트도 과반수 이상의 인스턴스에서 락을 획득할 수 없다. 이런 상황을 Split-brain 상태라고 부른다.\n이를 해결하기 위해서, 레디스 공식 문서는 아래의 3가지 방법을 제시한다.\n랜덤 딜레이 : 클라이언트들이 동일한 시간에 동시에 시도하지 않도록, 재시도 간격을 무작위로 적용하여 타이밍을 분산시킨다.\n멀티 플렉싱 : 클라이언트는 모든 Redis 인스턴스에 병렬로 동시에 락 요청을 보낸다. 락 요청 속도가 빨라지면, 여러 클라이언트가 동시에 요청하는 Time Window 가 줄어들어, Split-brain 가능성이 감소한다.\n빠른 락 해제 : 클라이언트가 과반수 락 획득에 실패했다면, 즉시 부분적으로 획득한 락을 해제해야한다. 다른 클라이언트가 락을 요청할 때 키 만료를 기다리지 않도록 해, 락 충돌 가능성을 줄이고 가용성을 높인다.\n\n애플리케이션 중단 및 네트워크 지연으로 인한 문제\n만약 락을 획득한 클라이언트가 Full GC로 인한 Stop-the-world 가 발생하는 등 긴 지연에 걸리거나, 네트워크 지연이 발생한 경우, 지연이 해소되는 동안 TTL이 먼저 만료되는 상황이 발생할 수 있다. 이 경우 기존 클라이언트의 지연이 해소되기 전에, 다른 클라이언트가 락을 획득하고 임계 영역에 진입할 수 있다.\n이런 상황에서 지연된 애플리케이션이 다시 복구되었을 때, 자신의 락이 만료됨을 인지 못한다면, 그대로 임계 영역에서 다시 작업을 이어나갈 수 있고, 이는 상호 배제의 위반이다.",

(중략)\n\n\n연말정산을 잘 활용하면 꽤 큰 금액을 환급받을 수 있습니다. 매년 찾아오는 절세 기회를 미리 준비하는 것이 중요해요.\n특히 이번에 도입된 ‘퇴직연금 실물이전 서비스’를 통해 기존 퇴직연금 상품을 다른 금융사로 쉽게 옮길 수 있게 되면서, 이왕 드는 퇴직연금을 더 나은 수익률을 제공하는 금융사로 이전하기가 한층 쉬워졌습니다. 만약 퇴직연금이 오랫동안 방치되어 있었다면 이번 기회를 활용해 다양한 금융사의 수익률과 수수료를 비교해 보고, 더 좋은 조건을 제공하는 곳으로 옮겨보세요. 단순히 금융사를 바꾸는 것만으로도 노후 자금을 크게 늘릴 수 있는 기회가 될 것입니다.\n기존에도 퇴직연금을 다른 금융사로 옮길 수 있었지만, 기존 상품을 매도하고 다시 매수해야 하는 번거로움과 손실 위험 때문에 많은 분들이 망설이셨습니다. 그러나 이제 퇴직연금 실물이전 서비스를 통해 이에 대한 부담이 크게 줄어들었습니다. 퇴직연금을 더 높은 수익률을 제공하는 금융사로 옮기는 것이 훨씬 간편해졌고, 이는 금융사 간 경쟁을 촉진시켜 우리 같은 고객들에게 더욱 유리한 환경을 만들어줄 것입니다.\n그렇다면 실물이전 서비스를 어떻게 활용해야 할까요? 우선적으로 할 일은 현재 내 퇴직연금 계좌를 확인하는 것입니다. 내 퇴직연금이 어디에 있는지, 어떤 상품에 투자되고 있는지를 파악하고, 현재 수익률이 어느 정도인지 확인해야 합니다. 만약 지금 운용 중인 상품이 수익률이 좋지 않거나, 다른 금융사에 비해 상대적으로 높은 수수료를 부과하고 있다면 이전을 고려하시는 게 좋겠습니다.\n\n💡 퇴직연금 실물이전 서비스 이용하려면?\n\n이전할 금융기관 선택 및 계좌 개설 → 실물이전 가능 상품 확인 → 기존 금융기관에 실물이전 신청 → 이전 절차 진행 및 완료\n퇴직연금 실물이전은 동일한 유형의 퇴직연금 제도(DB↔DB, DC↔DC, IRP↔IRP) 간에만 가능해요.\n이전하려는 금융기관에서 동일한 상품을 취급하지 않는 경우, 실물이전이 불가능할 수 있어요.\n\n\n\n.css-1lvcgm8{padding:22px;display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;border-radius:20px;}\n.css-13ko30i{width:375px;}토스에서 퇴직연금 손쉽게 옮기기\n\n연금저축펀드: 개인이 노후를 대비해 가입할 수 있는 연금 상품으로, 세액 공제를 받을 수 있어요. 100%까지 위험 투자 상품 운용이 가능하며, 납입한 금액에 대해 일정 금액의 세금을 공제받을 수 있습니다.\nDC형 퇴직연금: 확정기여형 퇴직연금 제도로, 회사가 근로자에게 일정 금액을 퇴직연금으로 납입하면, 그 금액을 근로자가 직접 운용하여 수익을 얻는 방식이에요. 근로자가 운용 결과에 따라 연금의 수익이 달라질 수 있습니다.\nIRP(개인형퇴직연금): 근로자가 퇴직 후의 노후 생활을 대비하기 위해 운용하는 퇴직연금 계좌. 70%까지 위험 상품에 투자할 수 있고 세액공제 혜택도 받을 수 있어서, 연금저축과 더불어 노후 자금을 마련하는 데에 유리해요.\n.css-1ifza5r{border:0;margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;height:1px;opacity:1;background:var(--tHairlineBackground);margin:0;}\nEdit 금혜원 Graphic 조수희 이동건",
