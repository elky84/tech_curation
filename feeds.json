        "content:encodedSnippet": "GSL is an implementation of the Guidelines Support Library specified by the\nC++ Core Guidelines.\nIt provides types and functions that help C++ developers write safer, more maintainable\ncode while following modern C++ best practices.\nWe are excited to announce the release of GSL v4.2.0! This release brings significant\nperformance improvements, new features, and important updates that align GSL with modern\nC++ standards.\nPerformance Boost for Span Iterator\nOne of the most notable changes in this release is the significant performance\nimprovements of span_iterator when using the Clang compiler. Previously, gsl::span\niterators could be up to 20 times slower than std::span under various workloads\n(range-for, <algorithm>, etc.). Through reorganization of the code and moving\naccess-checks out of the hot path, we have achieved performance parity for most\nworkloads (see #1168). This\nABI-preserving improvement makes gsl::span a more practical choice for code that is\nboth safe and fast.\nNew Features and Improvements\nAs the C++ Core Guidelines evolve with modern C++ practices, GSL continues to adapt and\ngrow. Working closely with the community, we’ve implemented key enhancements that make\nGSL more robust and easier to use in modern C++ codebases. These updates focus on type\nsafety, modern idioms, and better template support — areas crucial for production\ncode. Here are some of the key improvements since version 4.1.0:\nGSL Swap Support: Introduced gsl::swap specifically designed for safely swapping\ngsl::not_null pointers\nEnhanced Type Traits: Added element_type to gsl::not_null<T> for better type\ntrait consistency\nImproved Smart Pointer Support: Added support for strict_not_null with\nunique_ptr\nBetter SFINAE: Improved template substitution behavior throughout the library\nAlignment with C++ Standards\nAs part of our commitment to keeping GSL aligned with modern C++ development, we are\ndeprecating features that have been adopted into the C++ standard library. We recommend\nusing the C++ standard library equivalents for these features when possible. Here are\nthe features that have been deprecated in this release:\ngsl::unique_ptr\ngsl::shared_ptr\ngsl::byte (for C++17 and later)\nAdditionally, we have removed the long-deprecated string_span feature, encouraging\nusers to migrate to std::string_view.\nNote: We continue to recommend using gsl::span as a safer alternative to\nstd::span.\nCompatibility Updates\nWe want to make sure GSL runs well on the latest compilers and modern operating systems.\nTo that end, we have modernized our build infrastructure to validate that GSL is\nsupported by the latest development environments:\nUpdated compiler support to include Clang 16 to 18 and GCC 12 to 14\nUpgraded to Ubuntu 24.04 in our CI pipeline\nMore information about our supported platforms can be found in our\nREADME.\nBug Fixes and Standards Compliance\nSeveral important bugs have been fixed in this release:\nResolved a GCC-specific issue with list initialization of const references\nFixed SFINAE implementation in gsl::owner\nImproved include directive handling to prevent conflicts with standard library headers\nUpdated include paths to comply with C++ Core Guidelines\nTry It Out\nTo start using GSL v4.2.0, you can either:\nInstall via vcpkg: vcpkg install ms-gsl\nDownload from GitHub:\nmicrosoft/GSL\nFor detailed release notes and migration guidance, please visit our\nGitHub repository.\nContributing to GSL\nThis release would not have been possible without our community contributors. Special\nthanks to the following individuals for their valuable contributions:\n@ajtruckle\n@apenn-msft\n@asartori86\n@beinhaerter\n@daltairwalter\n@DanielJump\n@HenryHu\n@lord-pando\n@mhthies\n@paparodeo\n@tiagomacarios\nIf you wish to contribute to GSL, please refer to our open issues and pull requests in\nthe Microsoft/GSL repository on GitHub. We welcome\nyour feedback and contributions!\nPlease remember to follow our\nCode of Conduct when contributing to\nGSL.\nFeedback\nIn addition to contributing, we would love to hear your thoughts on the latest updates\nto GSL!

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The growth of data and need for increased power efficiency are leading to innovative storage solutions.\nHDDs have been growing in density, but not performance, and TLC flash remains at a price point that is restrictive for scaling. \nQLC technology addresses these challenges by forming a middle tier between HDDs and TLC SSDs.   QLC provides higher density, improved power efficiency, and better cost than existing TLC SSDs. \nToday, HDDs are the go-to storage solution for most data centers because of their lower cost and power footprint compared to other solutions like TLC flash. But while HDDs are growing in size, they haven’t been growing in I/O performance. In other words, the bandwidth per TB for HDDs has been dropping. This has been forcing data center engineers to meet their storage performance needs by shifting hot (frequently accessed) data to a TLC flash tier or by overprovisioning storage.\nQLC flash as a technology has been around since 2009. Adoption has been slow because it has historically operated at lower drive capacity points – less than 32TB. As well, high cost and limited write endurance didn’t make it an attractive alternative to TLC in the datacenter. \nIn the meantime, HDD densities have been growing without any significant increase in the throughput. As more data is stored on a given drive the need for I/O goes up proportionally. The continued densification of HDD capacity has led to a consistent decline in BW/TB. This has negatively affected a portion of hot workloads and forced bytes to get stranded on HDDs.\n\nQLC flash occupies a unique space in the performance spectrum in between HDDs and SSDs for servicing workloads that still depend upon performance at 10 MB/s/TB range i.e., where we had 16-20TB HDDs. Additionally there are workloads doing large batch IOs which do not need very high performance but still are in the 15-20 MB/s/TB range and use TLC flash today.\nQLC flash introduced as a tier above HDDs can meet write performance requirements with sufficient headroom in endurance specifications. The workloads being targeted are read-bandwidth-intensive with infrequent as well as comparatively low write bandwidth requirements. Since the bulk of power consumption in any NAND flash media comes from writes, we expect our workloads to consume lower power with QLC SSDs. \nThe advent of the 2Tb QLC NAND die along with 32-die stack becoming mainstream illustrates just how rapidly the density scaling of QLC flash is growing at a NAND package level as well as at drive level.\nWe expect QLC SSD density will scale much higher than TLC SSD density in the near-term and long-term. This will bring meaningful impact to server and rack level bytes densification as well as help lower per-TB acquisition and power costs at both the drive and server level. \n\nQLC at Meta\nMeta’s storage teams have started working closely with partners like Pure Storage, utilizing their DirectFlash Module (DFM) and DirectFlash software solution to bring reliable QLC storage to Meta. We are also working with other NAND vendors to integrate standard NVMe QLC SSDs into our data centers. \nWhile today QLC is lower in cost than TLC, it is not yet price competitive enough for a broader deployment. Still, the gains in power consumption efficiency are material and the above mentioned use cases are expected to greatly benefit from that. Given that HDDs are continuing to get colder as their density increases (decreasing BW/TB), and that NAND cost structures are improving with technology advancements, we believe that adding a QLC tier is the right path forward.\nHardware considerations for adopting QLC\nWhile E1.S as a form factor has been great for our TLC deployments, it’s not an ideal form factor to scale our QLC roadmap because its size limits the number of NAND packages per drive.\nThe Industry standard U.2-15mm is still a prevalent form factor across SSD suppliers and it enables us to potentially scale to 512TB capacity. E3 doesn’t bring additional value over U.2 at the moment and the market adoption split between the 4 variants of E3 makes it less attractive. Pure Storage’s DFMs can allow scaling up to 600TB with the same NAND package technology. Designing a server to support DFMs allows the drive slot to also accept U.2 drives. This strategy enables us to reap the most benefits in cost competition, schedule acceleration, power efficiency, and vendor diversity.  \nThe primary benefit of QLC drives is byte density at the drive and server level and the associated power efficiency. Within Meta, the byte density target of the QLC-based server is 6x the densest TLC-based server we ship today. Even though the BW/TB expected of QLC is lower than TLC, the QLC server bytes density requires a more performant CPU, faster memory and network subsystem to take advantage of the media capabilities.  \nAdapting our storage software for QLC \nAdopting Meta’s existing storage software to QLC has presented some interesting challenges. As discussed above, our QLC systems are very high in density. And we are targeting QLC SSDs as a higher performance media compared to HDDs. This raises throughput expectations beyond any single server throughput we ever had. \nScaling such high throughput across CPU cores and sockets requires careful placement of data and compute to process that I/O. We need to make sure we minimize data touchpoints and can separate the I/O by type. The software stack in Pure Storage’s solutions uses Linux userspace block device driver (ublk) devices over io_uring to both expose the storage as a regular block device and enable zero copy for data copy elimination – as well as talk to their userspace FTL (DirectFlash software) in the background. \nFor other vendors, the stack uses io_uring to directly interact with the NVMe block device.\nFurther, QLC SSDs have a significant delta between read and write throughput. Read throughput in the case of QLC can be as high as 4x or more than write throughput. What’s more, typical use cases around reads are latency sensitive so we need to make sure that the I/O delivering this massive read BW is not getting serialized behind the writes. This requires building, and carefully tuning, rate controllers and I/O schedulers.\nLooking forward\nMeta recognizes QLC flash’s potential as a viable and promising optimization opportunity for storage cost, performance, and power for data center workloads. As flash suppliers continue to invest in advanced fab processes and package designs and increase the QLC flash production output, we anticipate substantial cost improvements, making QLC flash progressively more attractive for a broader range of data center workloads. We are excited about driving innovation, fostering collaboration, and promoting ecosystem alignment in this evolving storage space.\nThe post A case for QLC SSDs in the data center appeared first on Engineering at Meta.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Part 3: System Strategies and Architecture\nBy: Varun Khaitan\nWith special thanks to my stunning colleagues: Mallika Rao, Esmir Mesic, Hugo Marques\nThis blog post is a continuation of Part 2, where we cleared the ambiguity around title launch observability at Netflix. In this installment, we will explore the strategies, tools, and methodologies that were employed to achieve comprehensive title observability at scale.\nDefining the observability endpoint\nTo create a comprehensive solution, we decided to introduce observability endpoints first. Each microservice involved in our Personalization stack that integrated with our observability solution had to introduce a new “Title Health” endpoint. Our goal was for each new endpoint to adhere to a few principles:\n\nAccurate reflection of production behavior\nStandardization across all endpoints\nAnswering the Insight Triad: “Healthy” or not, why not and how to fix it.\n\nAccurately Reflecting Production Behavior\nA key part of our solution is insights into production behavior, which necessitates our requests to the endpoint result in traffic to the real service functions that mimics the same pathways the traffic would take if it came from the usual callers.\nIn order to allow for this mimicking, many systems implement an “event” handling, where they convert our request into a call to the real service with properties enabled to log when titles are filtered out of their response and why. Building services that adhere to software best practices, such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the SOLID principles, and modularization, is crucial to have success at this stage. Without these practices, service endpoints may become tightly coupled to business logic, making it challenging and costly to add a new endpoint that seamlessly integrates with the observability solution while following the same production logic.\nA service with modular business logic facilitates the seamless addition of an observability endpoint.\nStandardization\nTo standardize communication between our observability service and the personalization stack’s observability endpoints, we’ve developed a stable proto request/response format. This centralized format, defined and maintained by our team, ensures all endpoints adhere to a consistent protocol. As a result, requests are uniformly handled, and responses are processed cohesively. This standardization enhances adoption within the personalization stack, simplifies the system, and improves understanding and debuggability for engineers.\nThe request schema for the observability endpoint.\nThe Insight Triad API\nTo efficiently understand the health of a title and triage issues quickly, all implementations of the observability endpoint must answer: is the title eligible for this phase of promotion, if not — why is it not eligible, and what can be done to fix any problems.\nThe end-users of this observability system are Launch Managers, whose job it is to ensure smooth title launches. As such, they must be able to quickly see whether there is a problem, what the problem is, and how to solve it. Teams implementing the endpoint must provide as much information as possible so that a non-engineer (Launch Manager) can understand the root cause of the issue and fix any title setup issues as they arise. They must also provide enough information for partner engineers to identify the problem with the underlying service in cases of system-level issues.\nThese requirements are captured in the following protobuf object that defines the endpoint response.\nThe response schema for the observability endpoint.\nHigh level architecture\nWe’ve distilled our comprehensive solution into the following key steps, capturing the essence of our approach:\n\nEstablish observability endpoints across all services within our Personalization and Discovery Stack.\nImplement proactive monitoring for each of these endpoints.\nTrack real-time title impressions from the Netflix UI.\nStore the data in an optimized, highly distributed datastore.\nOffer easy-to-integrate APIs for our dashboard, enabling stakeholders to track specific titles effectively.\n“Time Travel” to validate ahead of time.\nObservability stack high level architecture diagram\nIn the following sections, we will explore each of these concepts and components as illustrated in the diagram above.\nKey Features\nProactive monitoring through scheduled collectors jobs\nOur Title Health microservice runs a scheduled collector job every 30 minutes for most of our personalization stack.\nFor each Netflix row we support (such as Trending Now, Coming Soon, etc.), there is a dedicated collector. These collectors retrieve the relevant list of titles from our catalog that qualify for a specific row by interfacing with our catalog services. These services are informed about the expected subset of titles for each row, for which we are assessing title health.\nOnce a collector retrieves its list of candidate titles, it orchestrates batched calls to assigned row services using the above standardized schema to retrieve all the relevant health information of the titles. Additionally, some collectors will instead poll our kafka queue for impressions data.\nReal-time Title Impressions and Kafka Queue\nIn addition to evaluating title health via our personalization stack services, we also keep an eye on how our recommendation algorithms treat titles by reviewing impressions data. It’s essential that our algorithms treat all titles equitably, for each one has limitless potential.\nThis data is processed from a real-time impressions stream into a Kafka queue, which our title health system regularly polls. Specialized collectors access the Kafka queue every two minutes to retrieve impressions data. This data is then aggregated in minute(s) intervals, calculating the number of impressions titles receive in near-real-time, and presented as an additional health status indicator for stakeholders.\nData storage and distribution through Hollow Feeds\nNetflix Hollow is an Open Source java library and toolset for disseminating in-memory datasets from a single producer to many consumers for high performance read-only access. Given the shape of our data, hollow feeds are an excellent strategy to distribute the data across our service boxes.\nOnce collectors gather health data from partner services in the personalization stack or from our impressions stream, this data is stored in a dedicated Hollow feed for each collector. Hollow offers numerous features that help us monitor the overall health of a Netflix row, including ensuring there are no large-scale issues across a feed publish. It also allows us to track the history of each title by maintaining a per-title data history, calculate differences between previous and current data versions, and roll back to earlier versions if a problematic data change is detected.\nObservability Dashboard using Health Check Engine\nWe maintain several dashboards that utilize our title health service to present the status of titles to stakeholders. These user interfaces access an endpoint in our service, enabling them to request the current status of a title across all supported rows. This endpoint efficiently reads from all available Hollow Feeds to obtain the current status, thanks to Hollow’s in-memory capabilities. The results are returned in a standardized format, ensuring easy support for future UIs.\nAdditionally, we have other endpoints that can summarize the health of a title across subsets of sections to highlight specific member experiences.\nMessage depicting a dashboard request.\nTime Traveling: Catching before launch\n\nTitles launching at Netflix go through several phases of pre-promotion before ultimately launching on our platform. For each of these phases, the first several hours of promotion are critical for the reach and effective personalization of a title, especially once the title has launched. Thus, to prevent issues as titles go through the launch lifecycle, our observability system needs to be capable of simulating traffic ahead of time so that relevant teams can catch and fix issues before they impact members. We call this capability “Time Travel”.\nMany of the metadata and assets involved in title setup have specific timelines for when they become available to members. To determine if a title will be viewable at the start of an experience, we must simulate a request to a partner service as if it were from a future time when those specific metadata or assets are available. This is achieved by including a future timestamp in our request to the observability endpoint, corresponding to when the title is expected to appear for a given experience. The endpoint then communicates with any further downstream services using the context of that future timestamp.\nAn example request with a future timestamp.\nConclusion\nThroughout this series, we’ve explored the journey of enhancing title launch observability at Netflix. In Part 1, we identified the challenges of managing vast content launches and the need for scalable solutions to ensure each title’s success. Part 2 highlighted the strategic approach to navigating ambiguity, introducing “Title Health” as a framework to align teams and prioritize core issues. In this final part, we detailed the sophisticated system strategies and architecture, including observability endpoints, proactive monitoring, and “Time Travel” capabilities; all designed to ensure a thrilling viewing experience.\nBy investing in these innovative solutions, we enhance the discoverability and success of each title, fostering trust with content creators and partners. This journey not only bolsters our operational capabilities but also lays the groundwork for future innovations, ensuring that every story reaches its intended audience and that every member enjoys their favorite titles on Netflix.\nThank you for joining us on this exploration, and stay tuned for more insights and innovations as we continue to entertain the world.\n\nTitle Launch Observability at Netflix Scale was originally published in Netflix TechBlog on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Businesses of different sizes have various motives for prioritizing code security. For an enterprise client, it might have to do with compliance. For a business that handles user data, there could be very imminent risk to customers and staff alike. \nAny development team could fall prey to the rise of cybercrime and attacks as detailed in the CyberCrime Report and many other sources. This is one reason why it’s so important to secure your codebase against both seemingly simple and more sophisticated and malicious activity. \nThen again, it’s easy to say that developer teams need to prioritize security, but this is sometimes difficult to put into practice. What frameworks are most helpful? Can they be applied to teams of any size and industry? And which standards do developers trust to help them achieve a level of foundational security and safety?\nTable of Contents\n\nWhat is OWASP?\nCommon OWASP Top 10 checks\nSQL Injection\nPrevention is better than cure\nBroken Authentication\nSensitive data exposure\nXML External Entities (XXE)\nBroken Access Control\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nInsecure deserialization\n\nOWASP guidance in a nutshell\nJoin the discussion\n\n\nWhat is OWASP?\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an organization dedicated to improving software security. One of its primary contributions is the OWASP Top 10, which outlines the most critical security risks to web applications and provides the checks that organizations should consider when enhancing application security. While OWASP hasn’t officially released the list for 2025, we’re taking a closer list of some common contenders today. Let’s dive in: \nCommon OWASP Top 10 checks\nSQL Injection\nSQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of injection attack where an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL code on a database by manipulating the SQL queries made by an application.\nHow it happens:\nSQLi typically happens when user inputs are directly included in SQL statements without proper validation or escaping. For example:\nSELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ‘user_input’;\nIf user_input is not sanitized, an attacker could input something like admin’ –, which might change the original query’s logic.\nPrevention is better than cure\nTo prevent this, you could use prepared statements with parameterized queries to separate SQL logic from user input. Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements that can accept parameters. Always validate and sanitize user inputs. \nEnsure that only expected values are accepted (e.g., alphanumeric validation) and avoid displaying detailed error messages to users, which could give attackers insights into the database structure. The database account used by the application should have no more privileges than necessary, that way one can at least reduce the impact if an SQL injection is successful.\nYou also get Command Injections, which the attacker manages to execute arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. For example, an attacker might input ; rm -rf / to execute unauthorized commands. To prevent these you should avoid executing system commands, use safe, language-specific APIs that don’t invoke command shells, and if user inputs have to be included in a command shell, make sure that inputs are properly escaped. \nQodana’s Taint Analysis helps prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), command injections, and path traversal and is supported in IntelliJ IDEA as well as in Qodana for Php and JVM. \nBroken Authentication\nCheck for Broken Authentication aims to address vulnerabilities in user authentication processes and session management that can lead to a range of security risks.\nYou can address this by implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and making sure sessions are securely managed. MFA is a security mechanism that requires users to use two or more independent credentials to verify their identity. \nInstead of just relying on a username and a password, which can be stolen, guessed, or brute-forced, MFA adds extra layers of security that make authentication more secure with biometric, device, or knowledge entries. If you use this in conjunction with secure session management, you have a good starting point for better and more secure authentication. \nPrevention measures\nIt matters how applications handle user sessions over the duration of their interactions with the system. When users log in an application, the application creates a session (or token) to keep track of their authenticated status. The identifiers for these have to be unique and transmitted securely using HTTPS to encrypt data between the client and the server. \nSensitive data exposure\nSensitive data can include personal information (PII), payment information, healthcare records, authentication credentials, and any other data that could be harmful if exposed.\nTo combat this, developers need to encrypt data in transit over networks and “at rest”, i.e. stored on servers and databases. \nYou can do this by generating cryptographic keys that use secure, random sources and only allow authorized people and applications to access them. Never hard-code keys in the application or configuration files. You can also implement a key rotation policy. \nAlso keep in mind that Hardcoded secrets are related to several items in the OWASP Top 10, particularly “Sensitive Data Exposure” and “Broken Authentication.” Detecting hardcoded passkeys helps to mitigate risks associated with these vulnerabilities. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nXML External Entities (XXE)\nXML External Entities (XXE) is a vulnerability that happens when an XML parser doesn’t process external entity references properly. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability for:\nData exfiltration: Attackers can manipulate an XML input to read sensitive files from the server or sensitive information from other places.\nDenial of Service (DoS): By including a large number of entities in the XML file, an attacker can cause the application to consume excessive resources, leading to service outages.\nServer Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Attackers can access internal services and resources which are not directly accessible from the outside world.\nThe best way to mitigate XXE vulnerabilities is to entirely disable the external entities being processed. This can usually be configured in the XML parsing libraries that your application is using. \nFor example, if you’re using Java with DOM or SAX parsers, you can configure them to disable DTD processing and external entities:\nDocumentBuilderFactory dbf = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();\ndbf.setValidating(false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities”, false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities”, false);\ndbf.setFeature(“http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl”, true);\nYou can also implement strict validation and schema checks for XML inputs. This process ensures that the XML data adheres to a predefined structure and is what your application expects.\nBroken Access Control\nRole-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used method for restricting system access to authorized users. In RBAC, permissions are assigned based on roles rather than individual users, which helps streamline the management of user access. However, without proper implementation and regular testing, systems can become vulnerable. \nGet ahead of access issues\nClearly define roles based on job responsibilities and least privilege principles. Ensure roles align closely with user needs and limit permissions to what is strictly necessary. Some organizations may need to define hierarchical roles. For instance, a manager could inherit the permissions of their subordinates, but without additional privileges that they do not require.\nConduct periodic reviews of roles and permissions to ensure they remain relevant and appropriate. Consider any role changes in personnel or shifts in organizational processes. Implement temporary or context-sensitive roles for particular tasks or projects. This way, users can gain additional permissions as needed without permanently extending their permissions.\nMaintain detailed logs of access attempts and regularly monitor these logs for any suspicious activity. This can help you spot any causes for concern like unwanted access. \nControl testing is another important tactic to help identify potential vulnerabilities like horizontal (same level access) and vertical (higher-level access) privileges.You can use automated security testing tools that can simulate various attack vectors to check for access control weaknesses. Tools can be used to check access control lists (ACLs) and role permissions programmatically.\nSecurity Misconfiguration\nImproper security configurations are one of OWASP’s major checks because default settings can create security risks. \nTo prevent this, change any default passwords right after installing new systems. Those default passwords are often widely known and can be a goldmine for attackers. \nAlso, many applications and operating systems come with unnecessary services turned on by default, so go through and turn off those unused features to decrease vulnerabilities. Also make sure that default roles and access permissions aren’t giving users more access than they really need.\nAlso, apply security hardening guidelines for servers, databases, and applications to eliminate unnecessary features and reduce attack surfaces.\nAnd keep in mind that before deploying patches to production systems, it’s important to test them in a staging environment to identify any potential compatibility issues or bugs that could arise from the update.\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS)\nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into content delivered to users’ web browsers. When a user visits a page that contains XSS, the malicious script can execute within the context of that user’s session, leading to various risks, including data theft, session hijacking, or defacement of web applications.\nMitigating cross-site scripting risk\nMitigate this issue with output encoding to ensure that user inputs are properly encoded before they’re visible and only show up as plain text. You could do this by converting characters into their HTML equivalents, encoding characters that are specific to HTML attributes like “ and in JavaScript properly escaping a user input so that it won’t execute the script. You could also implement a content security policy to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. \nIf you’re using IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the Qodana plugin to find and address cross-site scripting. Find it under the Problems tab in the Security Analysis section. \n\n\n\n\nInsecure deserialization\nInsecure deserialization occurs when an application accepts data from untrusted sources and interprets it as a serialized object without proper validation. This opens the door for attackers to manipulate the serialized data, potentially leading to remote code execution, data tampering, or denial-of-service attacks. \nMitigate these risks\nAvoid deserializing untrusted data altogether. If deserialization is necessary, developers should implement stringent checks to validate the integrity and format of the incoming data. Using safe serialization formats, which don’t allow for arbitrary code execution, can hugely reduce the risks associated with processing untrusted data.\nIntegrity checks also play a big role in securing serialized data. Digital signatures or cryptographic hashes allow an application to verify that the serialized object has not been altered in any way it’s not supposed to be. \nBy signing serialized data with a private key, the application can later check the signature against the expected outcome using a public key, helping to ensure the data’s authenticity. Also, using hashes enables the application to confirm that the data remains unchanged. However, even with integrity checks, deserializing data from untrusted sources should be minimized or avoided.\nOWASP guidance in a nutshell\nSecure your application development and deployment more thoroughly by using these checks as a security benchmark. Regular security testing, code reviews, and security training for developers play a crucial role in minimizing risks associated with these vulnerabilities. \nIf you are implementing OWASP standards, consider using resources like the OWASP Cheat Sheets, OWASP Testing Guide, and OWASP Best Practices for secure coding. You can also use Qodana to look for issues and run select security checks in your CI/CD pipeline. \nJoin the discussion\nKeep a eye on X or JetBrains Bluesky for the announcement of our Taint Analysis roundtable – coming soon!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The Language Server Protocol (LSP) has been a fundamental part of the code editor landscape for years, providing a consistent development experience across different editors. The Angular Language Server leverages this protocol to provide Angular-specific features to compatible editors. However, not all IDEs take the same approach to delivering these capabilities. Let’s look at the major differences between VS Code, NeoVim, and WebStorm and finally answer the age-old question, “Why does WebStorm not just use the Angular Language Server?!”\nWhat is a language server, and how does the LSP work?\nModern code editors need to understand your code to provide features like autocompletion, go to definition, or error detection. Traditionally, each editor needed to implement this understanding for every programming language, leading to duplicated effort and inconsistent experiences across editors.\nThe Language Server Protocol (LSP) solves this by standardizing how editors communicate with language-specific analysis tools. Here’s how it works:\nYour editor (the client) sends information about your code (typically the file that is currently open in your editor) to a language server.\nThe language server analyzes the code and responds with insights.\nYour editor displays these insights as squiggly error lines, autocompletion popups, or other UI elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n// When you type this in your editor\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n      {{ item.property }}\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nclass MyComponent { }\nYour editor sends the file content to the language server. The server analyzes it and might respond with:\n{\n  \"diagnostics\": [{\n    \"message\": \"Property 'property' does not exist on type 'any'\",\n    \"range\": {\n      \"start\": {\"line\": 3, \"character\": 12},\n      \"end\": {\"line\": 3, \"character\": 20}\n    }\n  }]\n}\n// Your editor then shows the error underline\nThis standardization means that:\nDevelopers of editors and IDEs can add support for new languages just by implementing the LSP client once.\nLanguage tool developers can support all LSP-compatible editors with a single server and very small client implementations (JetBrains IDE plugin or VS Code plugin).\nDevelopers get consistent features across different editors.\nThe Angular Language Server specifically provides Angular-aware code analysis, offering features like template type checking, component property completion, and Angular-specific refactorings to any editor that supports LSP.\nBenefits of the Language Server Protocol\nThe LSP has established itself as the standard for providing editor intelligence across different development environments. It enables consistent features like type checking, code completion, and navigation across any LSP-compatible editor:\n@Component({\n  template: `\n    <div *ngFor=\"let item of items\">\n      {{ item?.deeply?.nested?.property }}\n    </div>\n  `\n})\nclass WhyTypeCheckingMatters { }\nWhile the Angular compiler would catch these template errors during build time, the language server provides immediate feedback in your editor. This means you can spot and fix type errors as you write your code, without waiting for the compilation step.\nVS Code: LSP’s golden child\nVS Code’s integration with the Angular Language Server is seamless and intuitive. Here are some of the features that you’ll be able to use after installing the necessary plugin:\nTemplate type checking: Because nobody likes finding out about undefined properties in production.\nGo To Definition: Jump straight to your TypeScript references.\nAutocompletion: For when you can’t remember the syntax of *ngFor or @switch.\nReal-time error detection: Catch those typos before they catch you out.\nThe best part? It’s all standardized. The same language server that powers VS Code can power any editor that speaks LSP.\nNeovim: for when Vim users want nice things, too\nRemember when Vim users had to type out every import statement manually? Pepperidge Farm remembers. Now, thanks to LSP, you get:\n-- Neovim config that actually gives you IDE features\nrequire'lspconfig'.angularls.setup{\n  -- Look ma, real autocomplete!\n}\nNeovim users now enjoy the same powerful features as VS Code users while keeping their beloved modal editing. It’s the best of both worlds – modern IDE features with an outstanding editing experience.\nThe caveats of language servers\nLanguage servers are great – they provide a consistent developer experience and guarantee correctness. However, the fact that language servers adhere to a standardized protocol means that they do have some limitations. For instance, even though most languages and frameworks have some kind of test support, the LSP is not aware of this concept, and, therefore, tests must be configured manually within the editor. This is also the case when working with debuggers, too.\nAdditionally, language servers generally look at the codebase on a “file by file” basis, and, more specifically, at the current cursor position. Generally speaking, this works great until it doesn’t… Implementing a multi-file refactoring, for instance, can be difficult (though not impossible). For this reason, extracting some HTML code into a new Angular component is not as straightforward as it might first sound. On top of that, language servers can usually only process one language at a time; therefore, refactoring a CSS class across languages can quickly become very cumbersome in a language server implementation. The Angular Language Server has a very clever trick for handling HTML and TypeScript, but more on that in the next section. CSS, on the other hand, doesn’t enjoy the same level of support. \nWhat’s more, adding further support for parts that don’t have dedicated compiler functionality is difficult to accomplish. One such example would be IntelliSense for the host property of the component decorator.\nWebStorm: a slightly different approach\nNow, here’s where things get interesting. WebStorm and other JetBrains IDEs take a different approach, and it’s not just about being contrarian. For the last few years, the Angular plugin has been pre-installed with WebStorm. As of now, this plugin does not utilize the Angular Language Server, but a custom-type engine. As part of our new Service-powered type engine (more about this in the future), we made some major changes to our Angular integration. Instead of using the entire Angular Language Server, WebStorm adopted Angular’s TCB (type-check block) engine, an integral part of the Angular Language Server. For more details, you can check out this talk at NG DE, but in short, the Angular Language Server converts the HTML code into TypeScript code and uses the generated TypeScript code to map errors and IntelliSense features back to the cursor position in the original HTML file. The screenshot below visualizes this concept.\n\n\n\n\nSee how this.counter is used in the template, which gets converted to the function _tcb1 on the right side, but isn’t properly declared in TestComponent. \nYou might now be asking, why doesn’t WebStorm just use the Angular Language Server? Well, it turns out template type checking is just one piece of the IDE puzzle. WebStorm’s architecture already handles most of what the Angular Language Server provides:\nNavigation\nCode completion\nQuick-fixes\nFurthermore, it offers parts of functionality that our users appreciate and that are not offered by the language server:\nUnit and E2E test integration for Jasmine, Jest, Vitest, Cypress, and Playwright.\nDebugging integration.\nSemantic highlighting of signals (fun fact: the Angular LSP does not provide syntax highlighting, which is part of the VS Code plugin).\nSpecial refactoring and quick-fix capabilities (e.g. extract Angular Component, create a signal ‘property’, etc.).\nIntelliSense without compiler support, like the host property mentioned above.\nEnhanced search capabilities (e.g. Find Usages for components).\nThe real-world implications\nSo what does this mean for you, the developer, just trying to get work done?\nVS Code and Neovim users\nStandardized experience across editors\nRegular updates with Angular releases\nBuilt-in type correctness\nWebStorm users\nBuilt-in integration of broader IDE tools (debugger, test runner, run configurations, etc.)\nDirect TCB integration for template type checking\nAdditional navigation, refactoring features, and consistent development experiences across different languages (HTML, CSS, and TypeScript)\nLooking forward\nThe Angular Language Server continues to evolve, making developers’ lives easier. Meanwhile, WebStorm’s specialized approach shows that there’s more than one way to achieve excellent Angular support.",

As always, we bring you the most interesting tutorials on Java, Kotlin, and other technologies, along with the latest news you don’t want to miss.\nWe’re also excited to introduce a brand-new AI section, which we reserve for the most fascinating content on the topic. And this month, we’re honored to feature Angie Jones as the author for our Featured Content section – so you know it’s going to be a great read!\nA lot of exciting things are happening, so without further ado, let’s go! \nFeatured Content\n\nAngie Jones is the Global Vice President of Developer Relations at Block, Inc.\nAn award-winning educator and international keynote speaker, Angie shares her extensive knowledge with software companies and conference audiences worldwide.A master inventor, Angie is recognized for her innovative, out-of-the-box thinking, which has led to 27 patented inventions in virtual worlds, collaboration software, social networking, smarter planet initiatives, and software development processes.\n\nAs a Java Champion, I make it a point to stay up to date on what’s happening in the JVM ecosystem and, more importantly, share it with my fellow Java developers. To my delight, we’re seeing the Java ecosystem embrace AI integration more than ever, thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP offers a standardized way to connect AI models with various tools and data sources, which means we can now employ AI agents like Goose within our local environments.\nJetBrains MCP Server\nI was pleased to see that JetBrains created an MCP Server plugin that integrates with MCP-enabled AI agents like Goose and Claude Desktop. This combination allows developers to enhance their JetBrains IDEs with AI capabilities, enabling tasks like code analysis and automated refactoring directly within the development environment. For example, I used Goose within IntelliJ IDEA. and right from the IDE’s terminal, I asked it to upgrade my project from Java 14 to Java 21 and modernize my codebase using the latest Java features:\n“Hey Goose, using the JetBrains extension, upgrade this project to use the latest Java LTS version and refactor the codebase to use newer Java features where beneficial.”\nWithin two minutes, I had a fully upgraded project with shiny new features such as string templates, pattern matching for switch and instanceof, sealed classes, records, text blocks, and switch expressions!\nThis alone blew me away, but I also loved that I could see how these new features worked within my own project, making them much easier to learn and apply.\nOfficial MCP Java SDK\nMCP is an open ecosystem. This means anyone can create an MCP server or even their own AI agent. There were already MCP SDKs for Kotlin, TypeScript, and Python, and as of mid-February (Valentine’s Day, to be exact ❤️), there’s now an official MCP Java SDK! There are more than 1,300 MCP servers that provide access to tons of APIs, but if there’s an API that you want to add to the ecosystem, you can now build it yourself with the MCP Java SDK.\nSpring AI with MCP\nFor those utilizing the Spring framework, you simply must check out Spring AI’s integration with MCP. Spring AI is incorporating MCP to make it easier for Spring Boot applications to interact with AI agents and external tools. For a visual demonstration of how MCP simplifies AI integration, check out this cool video by my dear friend and Spring expert, Josh Long.\nMore to explore!\nI have to tell you, I’m having an absolute blast incorporating AI into my workflows.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "With the latest update, the Toolbox App now supports remote development, allowing you to manage your JetBrains tools and projects both locally and on remote servers. This allows you to connect to cross-platform hosts, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, and use integrated OpenSSH for secure and customizable SSH connections. You can download the latest Toolbox EAP from the JetBrains website or update it from the Toolbox EAP channel in the Toolbox App Settings → Appearance and Behavior → Update quality: EAP. \nCross-platform hosts: Connect to Linux, Windows, and macOS\nWith the Toolbox App, remote development with JetBrains IDEs is now possible on Linux, Windows, and MacOS hosts. This allows you to manage your development environments both locally and across all remote hosts using major operating systems.\nRemote JetBrains IDE tools management\nBuilding upon its local tool management capabilities, the Toolbox App has extended its functionality to remote environments. This means you can install, access, update, and monitor your JetBrains IDEs on remote hosts just as easily as you do locally, ensuring a consistent and efficient workflow across all of your development environments.\nSecure and full-featured SSH support \nSSH support in the Toolbox App is backed by OpenSSH, bringing enterprise-level security and flexibility to remote development. Instead of relying on a limited, custom SSH implementation, the Toolbox App uses the standard OpenSSH executable, which integrates smoothly with the SSH configurations you already rely on. Just import them to the Toolbox App and start working.\nThis also means you can leverage the full range of OpenSSH capabilities, including ProxyJump, multi-factor authentication (MFA), reverse proxy setups, custom IdentityFile configurations, and askpass integration. Even advanced enterprise use cases, such as replacing the SSH binary entirely, are fully supported. \nThe Toolbox App uses the same trusted OpenSSH tools you already know, making setting up remote connections easier, more secure, and fully customizable to fit your workflow.\nTry it out \nGetting started with remote development in the Toolbox App is simple. First, download or update to the latest Toolbox App EAP release. Once installed, switch to the SSH context to see your available remote connections.\n\n\n\n\nNext, connect to your remote host by copying the SSH command you usually use in the terminal or by entering your username and host details, such as those from the EC2 console. As a general rule, if the connection works in the terminal, it should work in the Toolbox App as well.\n\n\n\n\nOnce connected, install your preferred JetBrains IDE, and you’re ready to go. For the best experience, we recommend trying the latest 2025.1 EAP versions, which include the latest remote development updates. To get the latest EAP version, select the EAP update channel in the tool settings.\n\n\n\n\nIf you already have your SSH connections set up in your SSH config or JetBrains Gateway, you don’t need to start from scratch. The Toolbox App allows you to import your existing configurations, so you can pick up right where you left off. Just bring in your saved connections, and you’ll be ready to connect and work without any extra setup.\n\n\n\n\nThe Toolbox App doesn’t stop at SSH, either. If you’re using an orchestration solution, whether in-house or commercial, there’s support for that too. With the available Plugin API, the Toolbox App can be extended to fit your specific needs. Several plugins for popular orchestrators are already in development, so stay tuned for updates. If you’re looking to migrate your in-house orchestration solution to Toolbox, feel free to reach out to us for guides and documentation.\nWe’d love for you to try these new features. Your feedback helps us improve, so please let us know your thoughts in the comments or through our issue tracker.\nThe JetBrains Toolbox team",

This gives you a more familiar experience when opening or saving files. If you prefer the previous behavior, you can restore it in Advanced Settings | User Interface. \n\n\n\n\nVersion control systems \nCommit details in the diff view\nYou can now see commit details directly in the diff view. The diff dialog now displays the commit message, author, date and time, and full commit hash, giving you a clearer view of a file’s history and helping you understand modifications faster.\n\n\n\n\nOption to run tools for pre-commit checks \nYou can now launch any tool to perform a pre-commit check alongside inspections and formatting. Custom checks can be configured as run configurations in the Run Configuration dialog. This helps you catch potential issues early and ensures your code meets project standards before it’s committed.\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic fetch when adding or modifying a Git remote\nIntelliJ IDEA now automatically fetches changes when you add or update a Git remote, ensuring you always have the latest branch list and commit history without needing to fetch them manually. Newly fetched branches will immediately appear in the Git branch tree. You’ll be able to start working with them right away, and your repository will always be up to date.\n\n\n\n\nOption to disable running Git commit hooks\nA new option allows you to instruct the IDE not to run Git commit hooks. Previously, Git hooks would execute automatically during commit operations, which might not have been desirable in all situations. With this update, you can now configure the IDE to skip these hooks, giving you more control over your commit process.\n\n\n\n\nDiscontinuation of the modal commit interface\nThe modal commit interface has been deactivated in IntelliJ IDEA. A few key reasons are behind this change: \nPerformance and overall experience – The modal commit option introduces lag and performance issues, adding to our technical debt in ways we can’t effectively address.\nRemote development – The current implementation of modal commits limits our ability to focus on a seamless remote development experience, which is becoming essential.\nNon-modal commit – We introduced a non-modal commit interface a few years ago, and it’s now the default for the vast majority of users. We know it’s not perfect, but we’re continually improving it. With the existing customization options, we believe it can be a solid option.\nWhile the non-modal commit workflow will now be the only built-in option, the modal commit experience will still be available through a separate plugin. The plugin won’t be actively maintained long-term, but we’ll review community pull requests to support it if there’s continued interest. If you’re looking to customize your commit workflow to make it similar to the modal commit one, we’ve gathered and documented several useful configuration options available in the IDE.\n\n\n\n\nFrameworks and technologies \nGit-ready Ubuntu image for easier Dev Container setup\nSetting up Dev Containers is now more seamless. When you clone a repository without a Dev Container configuration, the IDE now offers a wizard with an optimized Ubuntu-based container that has Git pre-installed. This update eliminates common issues like Git being missing, reducing setup time so you can focus on coding.\n\n\n\n\nEnhanced user experience with generated HTTP requests \nIntelliJ IDEA now opens HTTP requests generated from code in the right editor split, which means you no longer need to review them in a separate tab that was automatically opened.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for now. Stay tuned for more updates coming soon! For a complete list of changes in this build, check out the release notes.\nNow is the perfect time to explore the new features and share your feedback before the final release. Try out the IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Beta and let us know your thoughts in the comments or on X. If you run into any issues, please report them in our issue tracker.\nHappy developing!",

저도 한때는 절전 모드가 편리하다고 생각했어요. 하지만 사용하면 할수록 PC가 느려지고, 배터리도 예상보다 빨리 닳는 걸 깨닫고 나서 완전히 생각을 바꿨죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">윈도우의 절전 모드는 겉보기엔 편리하지만, 장기적으로 보면 여러 가지 문제가 생길 수 있습니다. 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 시스템 충돌 등 다양한 이유로 저는 절전 모드를 피하는 편이에요. 그렇다면, 왜 절전 모드가 문제가 될까요? 그리고 대안은 무엇일까요?</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  최신 PC는 부팅 속도가 빠르다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">예전에는 PC를 완전히 종료하면 다시 켤 때 시간이 오래 걸렸어요. 하지만 요즘은 SSD가 대중화되면서 부팅 속도가 크게 개선됐습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">SSD를 사용하면 부팅 시간이 평균 10초 내외로 줄어들어요. 게다가 윈도우의 '빠른 시작(Fast Startup)' 기능을 활성화하면 더욱 빠르게 사용할 수 있죠. 절전 모드를 쓰지 않아도 충분히 빠른 부팅이 가능하니, 굳이 사용할 이유가 적어집니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>⚠️ 절전 모드가 성능 저하를 유발할 수 있다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드는 PC를 완전히 끄는 것이 아니라, 메모리에 현재 상태를 저장한 채 최소한의 전력을 유지하는 방식이에요. 그래서 계속 절전 모드만 반복해서 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드에서 실행되는 프로그램이 많아져 PC 속도가 느려질 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히, 윈도우 업데이트 같은 중요한 작업은 시스템이 완전히 종료될 때 진행되는 경우가 많아서, 절전 모드를 너무 자주 사용하면 업데이트가 원활하게 이루어지지 않을 수도 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  배터리가 예상보다 빨리 닳는다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">\"노트북을 절전 모드로 두고 가방에 넣었는데, 몇 시간 후에 보니 배터리가 절반 이상 닳아 있었어요.\" 이런 경험 해보신 적 있나요?</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드는 전력을 완전히 차단하는 것이 아니라, 메모리를 유지하기 위해 계속 전력을 소비해요. 특히 'Modern Standby' 기능이 활성화된 상태에서는 네트워크 연결을 유지하면서도 절전 모드가 지속되기 때문에 배터리 소모가 심해질 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  시스템 프로세스가 중단될 가능성이 있다</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">컴퓨터를 완전히 종료하면 실행 중인 프로세스들이 정상적으로 종료되지만, 절전 모드에서는 그렇지 않습니다. 작업 중이던 프로그램이 강제로 중단되면서 오류가 발생할 가능성이 높아지는 거죠.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">특히, 포토샵이나 프리미어 프로 같은 전문 소프트웨어를 사용하는 경우, 절전 모드를 반복하면 프로젝트 파일이 손상될 수도 있어요. 이런 프로그램을 사용한다면 절전 모드보다는 완전 종료 또는 최대 절전 모드를 사용하는 것이 더 안전합니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>  하드웨어 부담과 비정상적인 작동</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드를 지속적으로 사용하면 하드웨어에도 부담이 갈 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 노트북을 절전 모드 상태로 가방에 넣어두면 내부적으로 열이 발생하면서 장기적으로 부품에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">또한, 배터리는 충전과 방전을 반복할수록 수명이 줄어드는데, 절전 모드를 자주 사용하면 배터리가 지속적으로 활성화된 상태가 되어 수명 감소가 빨라질 수 있어요.</p>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 data-ke-size=\"size26\"><span style=\"color: #009a87;\"><b>✅ 절전 모드 대신 사용할 수 있는 대안</b></span></h2>\n<p data-ke-size=\"size16\">절전 모드를 꼭 사용해야 할까요?

        "contentSnippet": "윈도우 PC에서 '절전 모드'를 자주 사용하면 성능 저하, 배터리 문제, 하드웨어 부담 등의 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 절전 모드 대신 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 활용하는 것이 더 나은 선택일 수 있습니다.\n\n\n \n\"PC를 켤 때 기다리는 게 싫어서 절전 모드를 자주 사용했는데, 오히려 성능이 나빠지는 느낌이에요.\" 이런 경험 있으신가요? 저도 한때는 절전 모드가 편리하다고 생각했어요. 하지만 사용하면 할수록 PC가 느려지고, 배터리도 예상보다 빨리 닳는 걸 깨닫고 나서 완전히 생각을 바꿨죠.\n \n윈도우의 절전 모드는 겉보기엔 편리하지만, 장기적으로 보면 여러 가지 문제가 생길 수 있습니다. 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 시스템 충돌 등 다양한 이유로 저는 절전 모드를 피하는 편이에요. 그렇다면, 왜 절전 모드가 문제가 될까요? 그리고 대안은 무엇일까요?\n \n  최신 PC는 부팅 속도가 빠르다\n예전에는 PC를 완전히 종료하면 다시 켤 때 시간이 오래 걸렸어요. 하지만 요즘은 SSD가 대중화되면서 부팅 속도가 크게 개선됐습니다.\n \nSSD를 사용하면 부팅 시간이 평균 10초 내외로 줄어들어요. 게다가 윈도우의 '빠른 시작(Fast Startup)' 기능을 활성화하면 더욱 빠르게 사용할 수 있죠. 절전 모드를 쓰지 않아도 충분히 빠른 부팅이 가능하니, 굳이 사용할 이유가 적어집니다.\n \n⚠️ 절전 모드가 성능 저하를 유발할 수 있다\n절전 모드는 PC를 완전히 끄는 것이 아니라, 메모리에 현재 상태를 저장한 채 최소한의 전력을 유지하는 방식이에요. 그래서 계속 절전 모드만 반복해서 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드에서 실행되는 프로그램이 많아져 PC 속도가 느려질 수 있어요.\n \n특히, 윈도우 업데이트 같은 중요한 작업은 시스템이 완전히 종료될 때 진행되는 경우가 많아서, 절전 모드를 너무 자주 사용하면 업데이트가 원활하게 이루어지지 않을 수도 있습니다.\n \n  배터리가 예상보다 빨리 닳는다\n\"노트북을 절전 모드로 두고 가방에 넣었는데, 몇 시간 후에 보니 배터리가 절반 이상 닳아 있었어요.\" 이런 경험 해보신 적 있나요?\n \n절전 모드는 전력을 완전히 차단하는 것이 아니라, 메모리를 유지하기 위해 계속 전력을 소비해요. 특히 'Modern Standby' 기능이 활성화된 상태에서는 네트워크 연결을 유지하면서도 절전 모드가 지속되기 때문에 배터리 소모가 심해질 수 있습니다.\n \n  시스템 프로세스가 중단될 가능성이 있다\n컴퓨터를 완전히 종료하면 실행 중인 프로세스들이 정상적으로 종료되지만, 절전 모드에서는 그렇지 않습니다. 작업 중이던 프로그램이 강제로 중단되면서 오류가 발생할 가능성이 높아지는 거죠.\n특히, 포토샵이나 프리미어 프로 같은 전문 소프트웨어를 사용하는 경우, 절전 모드를 반복하면 프로젝트 파일이 손상될 수도 있어요. 이런 프로그램을 사용한다면 절전 모드보다는 완전 종료 또는 최대 절전 모드를 사용하는 것이 더 안전합니다.\n \n  하드웨어 부담과 비정상적인 작동\n절전 모드를 지속적으로 사용하면 하드웨어에도 부담이 갈 수 있어요. 예를 들어, 노트북을 절전 모드 상태로 가방에 넣어두면 내부적으로 열이 발생하면서 장기적으로 부품에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.\n또한, 배터리는 충전과 방전을 반복할수록 수명이 줄어드는데, 절전 모드를 자주 사용하면 배터리가 지속적으로 활성화된 상태가 되어 수명 감소가 빨라질 수 있어요.\n \n✅ 절전 모드 대신 사용할 수 있는 대안\n절전 모드를 꼭 사용해야 할까요? 더 좋은 방법이 있습니다.\n \n1️⃣ 완전 종료(Shut Down)\nPC를 장시간 사용하지 않을 때는 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 깔끔한 방법이에요. 이렇게 하면 시스템이 완전히 리셋되면서 불필요한 프로세스가 종료되고, 성능이 최적화됩니다.\n \n2️⃣ 최대 절전 모드(Hibernate)\n노트북을 잠시 닫아야 하지만 배터리를 아끼고 싶다면, 최대 절전 모드를 활용해 보세요. 이 모드는 현재 작업 상태를 저장한 후 PC를 완전히 꺼버리기 때문에 전력 소모가 없습니다. 그리고 다시 켜면 원래 작업하던 상태로 바로 돌아올 수 있어요.\n \n3️⃣ 빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 활성화\n윈도우의 빠른 시작 기능을 활성화하면 부팅 속도를 더 빠르게 할 수 있어요. 설정 방법은 다음과 같습니다.\n\n\n\n제어판(Control Panel) > 전원 옵션(Power Options)으로 이동\n왼쪽 메뉴에서 전원 버튼 작동 설정(Choose what the power button does) 선택\n빠른 시작 켜기(Turn on fast startup) 옵션 활성화 후 저장\n이 기능을 활용하면 절전 모드를 사용하지 않아도 빠르게 PC를 켤 수 있습니다.\n \n✍️ 결론\n절전 모드는 편리한 기능이지만, 장기적으로 보면 성능 저하, 배터리 소모, 하드웨어 부담 등의 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다. 그래서 저는 절전 모드를 거의 사용하지 않고, 대신 완전 종료, 최대 절전 모드, 빠른 시작 기능을 활용하고 있어요.\n여러분도 혹시 절전 모드 때문에 불편을 겪고 계신가요? 그렇다면 오늘부터라도 더 효율적인 방법을 사용해 보세요!  \n  Q&A\n1. 절전 모드를 사용하면 배터리가 빨리 닳는 이유는?\n절전 모드에서도 메모리를 유지하기 위해 일정량의 전력을 계속 사용하기 때문입니다. 특히 최신 윈도우 노트북은 네트워크 연결까지 유지하려고 하면서 배터리 소모가 더 심해질 수 있습니다.\n2. 절전 모드 대신 가장 좋은 대안은?\nPC를 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 하지만 작업 상태를 유지해야 한다면 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 절전 모드보다 훨씬 효과적입니다.\n3. 절전 모드를 계속 사용하면 성능이 저하될 수 있나요?\n네, 절전 모드를 반복 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드 프로세스가 제대로 종료되지 않아 PC가 느려질 수 있습니다.\n4. 빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 기능을 활성화하면 절전 모드가 필요 없을까요?\n네, 빠른 시작 기능을 켜면 부팅 속도가 절전 모드에서 깨어나는 것과 거의 비슷한 수준으로 빨라지므로 절전 모드를 굳이 사용할 필요가 없습니다.\n5. 노트북을 이동할 때 어떤 전원 옵션을 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\n가방에 넣고 이동할 때는 반드시 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 절전 모드를 사용하면 내부 발열이 발생할 수 있어요.\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드를 사용하면 배터리가 빨리 닳는 이유는?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"절전 모드에서도 메모리를 유지하기 위해 일정량의 전력을 계속 사용하기 때문입니다. 특히 최신 윈도우 노트북은 네트워크 연결까지 유지하려고 하면서 배터리 소모가 더 심해질 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드 대신 가장 좋은 대안은?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"PC를 완전히 종료하는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 하지만 작업 상태를 유지해야 한다면 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 절전 모드보다 훨씬 효과적입니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"절전 모드를 계속 사용하면 성능이 저하될 수 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 절전 모드를 반복 사용하면 시스템 메모리가 점점 쌓이고, 백그라운드 프로세스가 제대로 종료되지 않아 PC가 느려질 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"빠른 시작(Fast Startup) 기능을 활성화하면 절전 모드가 필요 없을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"네, 빠른 시작 기능을 켜면 부팅 속도가 절전 모드에서 깨어나는 것과 거의 비슷한 수준으로 빨라지므로 절전 모드를 굳이 사용할 필요가 없습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"노트북을 이동할 때 어떤 전원 옵션을 사용하는 것이 좋을까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"가방에 넣고 이동할 때는 반드시 '완전 종료'나 '최대 절전 모드'를 사용하는 것이 좋습니다. 절전 모드를 사용하면 내부 발열이 발생할 수 있어요.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Claude, ChatGPT, Notion AI 등을 조합해 콘텐츠 제작을 더 효율적으로 하는 방법을 알아보세요.\nAI 도구를 활용한 생산성 극대화, 어떻게 하면 좋을까요?\n요즘 AI를 활용한 업무 방식이 점점 정교해지고 있어요. 단일 도구를 사용하는 것도 좋지만, 여러 개의 AI 툴을 조합하면 훨씬 강력한 결과를 얻을 수 있죠. 저도 여행 블로그 콘텐츠를 제작하면서 다양한 AI를 조합해 사용하고 있는데요. 어떤 방식으로 활용하면 효율을 극대화할 수 있는지 소개해 드릴게요.\n\n\n  아이디어 브레인스토밍\n글을 쓰기 전, 가장 먼저 해야 할 일은 '무엇을 쓸 것인가'에 대한 고민이죠. Claude와 ChatGPT를 활용해 아이디어를 얻어요.\n\"도시 여행 가이드를 작성하려고 해. 독특한 문화 체험과 숨겨진 명소를 포함하는 색다른 주제를 추천해 줄 수 있어?\"\nClaude는 다양한 제목과 주제를 추천해 주고, 이를 토대로 글의 주요 섹션을 정리할 수 있어요. 이 과정에서 Perplexity를 활용해 트렌드를 조사하면 더욱 유용합니다.\n✍️ 리서치 정리\n리서치를 하다 보면 자료가 너무 많아져서 정리가 어려울 때가 있어요. 이럴 때 Notion AI의 \"Summarize this page\" 기능을 활용하면 핵심 내용만 추려볼 수 있습니다.\n예를 들어, Claude에서 받은 아이디어를 정리한 후 Notion AI에 요약을 맡기면 한눈에 보기 편한 포인트들만 남길 수 있어요. 특히 Notion을 자주 사용하신다면 AI 기능을 적극 활용해 보세요.\n ️ 글의 구조 잡기\n이제 글을 본격적으로 작성할 차례입니다. ChatGPT는 글의 구조를 잡는 데 유용한 도구예요. 예를 들어, \"유럽에서 저렴하게 여행하는 법\"을 쓴다고 가정하면, ChatGPT에 이런 프롬프트를 입력할 수 있어요.\n\"예산이 적은 여행자를 위한 유럽 여행 가이드를 작성하려고 해. 교통비 절약, 저렴한 숙소 찾기, 무료 명소 추천 등 실용적인 정보를 포함한 개요를 만들어 줄래?\"\n이렇게 하면 ChatGPT가 섹션별 추천 내용을 제공하는데, 이를 참고하여 내 경험과 결합해 더욱 풍부한 콘텐츠를 만들 수 있어요.\n ️ 이미지 편집\n사진 작업을 할 때 AI를 활용하면 시간을 크게 절약할 수 있습니다. 특히 어두운 사진의 노이즈를 제거하는 Lightroom의 Denoise AI 기능을 추천해요.\n  Denoise: 저조도 사진에서 노이즈 제거\n  자동 피사체 선택: 특정 부분만 조정 가능\n✨ Auto Enhance: 색감 및 밝기 자동 보정\n하지만 AI 보정을 너무 과하게 하면 부자연스러워질 수 있으니, 적절한 수치를 조정하는 것이 중요합니다.\n✨ 문장 교정\n블로그 글을 작성한 후에는 반드시 문법 검토를 해야 합니다. 저는 ChatGPT를 활용해 오타와 문법 오류를 잡아요.\n글을 작성한 후 ChatGPT 등에서 검토\n맞춤법과 문법 수정\n프롬프트 요청으로 문장을 더 간결하게 다듬기\n이렇게 하면 가독성이 향상되고, 독자들이 글을 읽기 더 편해집니다.\n  SNS 콘텐츠 제작\n블로그 글을 작성한 후에는 SNS에서 홍보하는 것도 중요하죠. 저는 ChatGPT를 활용해 Pinterest용 포스트 초안을 만들고, Tailwind로 예약 발행합니다.\n\"유럽 저가 여행 블로그를 위한 Instagram 게시글 3개를 작성해 줘. '한 달 동안 100만 원으로 유럽 여행하기'라는 글을 홍보할 거야. 유익하면서도 흥미로운 내용을 포함해 줘.\"\n이렇게 생성된 초안을 검토한 후, 직접 수정을 거쳐 Tailwind로 예약하면 SNS 관리가 훨씬 쉬워집니다.\n  마무리\nAI는 개별 도구를 단독으로 사용하는 것보다, 여러 개를 조합할 때 더 큰 효과를 발휘합니다. 저는 Claude, ChatGPT, Notion AI, Lightroom, Tailwind 등을 조합해 콘텐츠 제작을 최적화하고 있어요.\n  여러분도 AI 도구들을 조합해서 더 스마트한 워크플로우를 만들어 보세요! 사용해 본 AI 툴이 있다면 댓글로 공유해 주세요.  \n자주 묻는 질문 (Q&A)\nQ1. AI 도구를 조합하면 어떤 장점이 있나요?\nA. 시간 절약, 콘텐츠 품질 향상, 일관된 스타일 유지 등의 장점이 있습니다.\nQ2. ChatGPT로 글을 대신 작성하는 것이 좋은가요?\nA. 기본 아웃라인을 만들거나 아이디어를 얻는 용도로 활용하는 것이 좋습니다. 최종 글은 직접 수정하는 것이 자연스럽습니다.\nQ3. Notion AI의 무료 사용량은 어느 정도인가요?\nA. 워크스페이스당 50회의 무료 AI 응답이 제공됩니다.\nQ4. AI가 편집한 사진은 자연스러울까요?\nA. Lightroom AI 같은 툴을 적절히 활용하면 자연스럽게 보정할 수 있지만, 과도하게 사용할 경우 인공적인 느낌이 날 수 있습니다.\n© 2025 AI 생산성 극대화 가이드 | 어떤오후의 프리웨어 이야기\n\n\n\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"FAQPage\",\n  \"mainEntity\": [\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"AI 도구를 조합하면 어떤 장점이 있나요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"시간 절약, 콘텐츠 품질 향상, 일관된 스타일 유지 등의 장점이 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"ChatGPT로 글을 대신 작성하는 것이 좋은가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"기본 아웃라인을 만들거나 아이디어를 얻는 용도로 활용하는 것이 좋습니다. 최종 글은 직접 수정하는 것이 자연스럽습니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n   {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"Notion AI의 무료 사용량은 어느 정도인가요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"워크스페이스당 50회의 무료 AI 응답이 제공됩니다.\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"@type\": \"Question\",\n      \"name\": \"AI가 편집한 사진은 자연스러울까요?\",\n      \"acceptedAnswer\": {\n        \"@type\": \"Answer\",\n        \"text\": \"Lightroom AI 같은 툴을 적절히 활용하면 자연스럽게 보정할 수 있지만, 과도하게 사용할 경우 인공적인 느낌이 날 수 있습니다.\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

YouTube 알고리즘은 사용자가 본 영상의 주제를 기반으로 다음 추천 영상을 결정하니까요.\n \n❌ 주의할 점:\n호기심에 클릭 금지! 관심 없는 영상은 클릭하지 마세요.\n실수로 클릭한 영상은 ‘기록’에서 바로 삭제할 것!\n✔ 시청 기록을 보호하는 방법:\n특정 콘텐츠를 검색해야 할 때는 ‘시청 기록 일시 중지’ 기능 사용\n\n방법: YouTube ‘기록’ → ‘시청 기록 일시 중지’\n \n3️⃣ 좋아요는 신중하게, 싫어요도 적극 활용\n‘좋아요’를 누르는 것도 YouTube 추천 알고리즘에 큰 영향을 줍니다. 하지만 무조건 좋아요를 누르면 오히려 추천 피드가 혼란스러워질 수 있어요.\n \n✔ 좋아요 활용법:\n**보고 싶은 영상에만 ‘좋아요’를 누르세요.\n예전에는 좋아했지만 지금은 관심 없는 영상은 ‘좋아요 취소’!\n❌ 싫어요 활용법:\n특정 유형의 콘텐츠를 추천받고 싶지 않다면 ‘싫어요’ 버튼 클릭\n더 강력한 차단을 원하면 ‘이 채널 추천 안 함’ 옵션 활용\n  ‘좋아요’와 ‘싫어요’를 전략적으로 사용하면 원하는 영상만 추천받을 수 있어요!\n \n4️⃣ 검색 기록도 관리해야 한다\nYouTube는 시청 기록뿐만 아니라 검색 기록도 추천 알고리즘에 반영합니다. 내가 검색한 주제와 관련된 영상이 피드에 나타나는 이유죠.\n\n\n \n✔ 검색 기록 정리 방법:\n프로필 아이콘 클릭 → ‘YouTube 데이터’ 선택\n‘YouTube 검색 기록 포함’ 옵션 체크 해제\n필요하면 ‘검색 기록 삭제’\n  검색 기록을 삭제하면 특정 키워드 검색이 이후 추천에 영향을 주지 않아요!\n \n5️⃣ 추천 주제 필터를 활용해 원하는 영상만 보기\nYouTube 홈 화면 상단에는 내가 관심 있는 주제를 기반으로 한 필터가 표시됩니다.\n이 기능을 적극 활용하면 원하는 주제의 영상만 추천받을 수 있어요!\n\n\n \n✔ 활용법:\n상단의 주제 필터를 클릭하면 관련된 영상만 피드에 표시됨\n원하는 주제가 계속 나오도록 비슷한 주제의 영상을 여러 개 시청\n  관심 없는 주제가 계속 추천된다면?\n‘관심 없음’ 또는 ‘이 채널 추천 안 함’을 선택하세요!\n \n  YouTube 추천 피드를 정리하는 마무리 꿀팁\n✅ 시청 기록을 삭제하고 새로운 추천을 받는다\n✅ 현재 관심 있는 영상만 시청한다\n✅ 좋아요, 싫어요를 신중하게 활용한다\n✅ 검색 기록을 관리해 추천 피드에 영향을 주지 않는다\n✅ 주제 필터를 활용해 원하는 영상만 추천받는다\n \n이 방법들을 실천하면 YouTube가 내가 원하는 영상만 추천하는 최적의 플랫폼으로 변할 거예요.\n불필요한 콘텐츠에 시간 낭비하지 말고, 원하는 정보만 골라서 시청해 보세요!  \n  Q&A (자주 묻는 질문)\n1. YouTube 추천 피드를 완전히 초기화할 수 있나요?\n네! ‘시청 기록 삭제’ + ‘검색 기록 삭제’를 하면 추천 피드가 초기화됩니다. 하지만 완전히 새롭게 만들려면 이후의 시청 습관도 신경 써야 해요.\n2. 검색 기록을 남기지 않고 영상을 볼 수 있나요?\n네! ‘시청 기록 일시 중지’ 기능을 사용하면 검색해도 기록이 남지 않아요.\n3. 특정 채널의 영상이 추천되지 않도록 하는 방법은?\n영상에서 ‘이 채널 추천 안 함’을 선택하면 해당 채널의 영상이 더 이상 추천되지 않습니다.\n4. YouTube 알고리즘이 내 관심사를 파악하는 기준은?\nYouTube는 시청 기록, 검색 기록, 좋아요, 싫어요, 구독 정보, 피드백(‘관심 없음’ 선택 등)을 종합적으로 분석해서 추천을 만듭니다.\n5. 주제별 추천 필터는 어떻게 활용하면 좋나요?\n홈 화면 상단의 주제 필터를 클릭하면 특정 주제의 영상만 볼 수 있습니다. 관심 있는 주제를 여러 개 클릭하면 추천 피드가 더욱 최적화됩니다.",

NHN Cloud의 클라우드AI팀 이태형입니다.\r\r\n로그 데이터가 쌓일수록 조회 속도가 느려지는 문제, 한 번쯤 겪어 보셨을 텐데요. 이 글에서는 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 저희 팀에서 Trino를 도입하여 성능을 개선한 과정을 공유해 보려 합니다. 재미있게 읽어 주세요! \r\r\n\r\r\n# 개요: NHN AppGuard\r\r\n[NHN AppGuard](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/service/security/nhn-appguard) 서비스에 Trino를 적용한 이야기를 드릴 예정이라서 먼저 해당 서비스를 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN AppGuard는 모바일 애플리케이션을 보호하기 위해 사용자의 이상 행위를 탐지하거나 차단하는 모바일 앱 보안 솔루션입니다. NHN AppGuard의 서버는 탐지/차단 로그를 안전하게 저장하고, 각종 조건 검색과 대시보드를 제공합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Trino_1.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino1.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n## NHN AppGuard 로그\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN AppGuard는 평균 600만개/일 가량의 로그를 수집하고 있습니다. 이러한 로그는 NHN AppGuard 로그 워크플로에 따라 DB에 적재됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Trino_2_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino2900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n## 이슈 발생\r\r\n\r\r\n대부분의 쿼리가 월 단위 집계 성격을 띠는 이유로 질의 대상 row 가 1억 건이 넘는 경우가 많아 이슈가 발생했습니다.\r\r\n발생한 이슈는 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. 검색 조건 변경 시 대시보드 화면에서 타임아웃 발생\r\r\n![Trino_3.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino3.png)\r\r\n2. 집계 쿼리가 수행되는 새벽 시간대에 slow query 발생\r\r\n![Trino_4.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino4.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n## 일반적인 해결 방안\r\r\n\r\r\n위 이슈들은 결국 쿼리의 성능이 원인이기 때문에 먼저 쿼리 최적화를 수행했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. index 문제\r\r\n    1. 쿼리 검수를 통해 index의 순서를 변경하고\r\r\n    2. 의도한 index가 적용되도록 쿼리에 index hint를 추가했습니다.\r\r\n2. 쿼리의 문제\r\r\n    1. 한 달 기간 전체 데이터를 스캔하는 쿼리를 당일 증가분만 조회하도록 수정하고\r\r\n    2. 대시보드를 매번 조회하지 않고 일 배치 작업으로 미리 계산해 둔 데이터를 조회하고\r\r\n    3. 조회 가능한 기간을 제한했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n이러한 최적화를 통해 일시적으로 이슈가 해소되었습니다.\r\r\n하지만 NHN AppGuard의 로그는 점차 늘어나고, 집계할 데이터의 종류도 증가했으며, 조회 기간 감소에 대한 불만이 발생하여 다른 접근이 필요했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 로그 저장소 검토\r\r\n\r\r\nMySQL을 대신해 로그를 저장하기에 적절한 로그 저장소를 검토했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Elasticsearch (LNCS)\r\r\n    1. 검색에 좋은 성능\r\r\n    2. 상품 스펙상 최대 120일 저장 제한\r\r\n2. Trino (DataQuery)\r\r\n    1. 복잡한 집계 쿼리에 좋은 성능\r\r\n    2. 여러 데이터 소스 간 federation 지원\r\r\n    3. 저장 기간 제한 없음\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN AppGuard는 로그의 저장 기간을 기존 90일에서 늘리는 것을 계획하고 있었고, 무엇보다 대부분의 쿼리가 집계 성격을 많이 띠어 Trino가 적절하다고 판단했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# Trino와 DataQuery\r\r\n\r\r\n## Trino란\r\r\n\r\r\n[Trino 공식 홈페이지](https://trino.io)를 보면 아래와 같은 문구를 찾을 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Trino, a query engine that runs at ludicrous speed\r\r\n> Fast distributed SQL query engine for big data analytics that helps you explore your data universe.\r\r\n\r\r\n키워드를 뽑아 보면 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. Fast - 빠르다\r\r\n2. Distributed - 분산 처리한다\r\r\n3. analytics - 분석에 적절하다\r\r\n\r\r\n## Trino 특징\r\r\n\r\r\n마찬가지로 [Trino 공식 홈페이지](https://trino.io)에서는 아래와 같은 특징을 소개합니다.\r\r\n![Trino_5.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino5.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n여기서도 키워드를 뽑아보면 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. distributed: 분산 처리로 빠르고\r\r\n2. ANSI SQL: 표준 SQL 을 호환하여 현재 쿼리문을 수정할 필요가 없고\r\r\n3. S3: OBS에 저장하여 스토리지 비용을 줄일 수 있고\r\r\n4. Query Federation: OBS의 데이터와 MySQL 데이터를 하나의 쿼리로 join할 수 있다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## Trino 동작 원리\r\r\n\r\r\nTrino의 동작 원리는 [Presto: SQL on Everything](https://trino.io/Presto_SQL_on_Everything.pdf)라는 논문에 자세히 소개하고 있습니다.\r\r\n해당 논문의 일부를 가볍게 살펴보겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 구조도\r\r\n![Trino_6.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino6.png)\r\r\n\r\r\nTrino는 하나의 Coordinator 노드와 여러 개의 Worker 노드로 구성됩니다. Coordinator 노드는 쿼리의 인입 지점으로 admit, parsing, planning, optimizing, orchestration 등을 수행하고, worker node는 query processing을 담당합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 요청 처리 순서\r\r\n\r\r\nCoordinator 노드가 분산 처리를 계획하면 worker node가 병렬로 처리해서 복잡한 쿼리가 더 빠르게 실행되는 원리입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. client → coordinator: http request (SQL stmt)\r\r\n2. coordinator: evaluate request(parsing, analyzing, **optimizing distributed execution plan**)\r\r\n3. coordinator: plan to worker\r\r\n    1. task 생성\r\r\n    2. **splits** 생성(addressable chunk in external storage)\r\r\n    3. splits을 task에 할당\r\r\n4. worker: run task\r\r\n    1. fetching splits\r\r\n    2. 다른 worker에서 생성한 intermediate data 처리\r\r\n        1. worker 간에는 intermediate data를 memory에 저장하여 공유\r\r\n        2. **shuffle**이 발생할 수 있음\r\r\n             \\*shuffle = node 간 데이터 재분배\r\r\n    3. query의 shape에 따라 모든 데이터를 처리하지 않고 반환\r\r\n\r\r\n## Trino 쿼리 실행 예시\r\r\n\r\r\n### 그림으로 살펴보기\r\r\n* 쿼리문\r\r\n![Trino_7.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino7.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* logical plan\r\r\n![Trino_8.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino8.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* distributed plan (stage)\r\r\n![Trino_9.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino9.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* optimized plan (pipeline, parallelism)\r\r\n![Trino_10.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino10.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### 실행 순서\r\r\n\r\r\n1.

Query Execution = Local Data Flow → Shuffles → Writes\r\r\n\r\r\n## DataQuery\r\r\n\r\r\n[NHN Cloud의 DataQuery](https://www.nhncloud.com/kr/service/data-analytics/dataquery?lang=ko) 서비스는 위에서 소개한 Trino를 기반으로 대규모 데이터에 대해 쿼리를 실행할 수 있는 서비스입니다.\r\r\n이를 통해 원하는 클러스터 스펙을 지정하고 연결할 데이터 소스만 작성하면 Trino의 복잡한 설치와 설정 과정 없이 사용이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n# Trino 적용 - 개념\r\r\nTrino를 적용하기 위해 알아야 할 개념을 소개합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n## 데이터 소스 선정\r\r\nTrino는 여러 종류의 데이터 소스를 지원합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN AppGuard는 로그 저장 기간 증가를 계획하고 있어 저장 비용을 절약하기 위해 OBS를 데이터 소스로 선정하였습니다.\r\r\nOBS 데이터 소스를 사용하는 경우 데이터의 타입도 Parquet, JSON, ORC, CSV, Text 중에 선택해 주어야 해서, 위와 동일한 이유로 Parquet 파일 포맷을 선택하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Apache Parquet\r\r\n\r\r\n[Apache Parquet 홈페이지](https://parquet.apache.org)에는 Parquet를 아래와 같이 설명합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Apache Parquet is an open source, column-oriented data file format designed for efficient data storage and retrieval. It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk.

NHN AppGuard는 redis를 사용하고 있지 않아 trino와 redis 두 컴포넌트의 추가로 인한 운영 복잡도 증가가 부담되어 선택하지 않았습니다.\r\r\n3. **중간 DB 사용 - MySQL**\r\r\n    1. kafka → log-batch → save to mysql → mysql → tier down in daily-batch → save obs → obs\r\r\n    2. 기존에 사용하던 MySQL 구성을 변경하지 않아 수정 소요가 적었고\r\r\n    3.

It offers excellent schema evolution, and has implementations for the JVM (Java, Kotlin, Scala, …), Python, C/C++/C#, PHP, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, and even Perl.\r\r\n\r\r\n# Trino 적용 - 구현\r\r\n\r\r\n## tier down 구현\r\r\n\r\r\n### 논리 구조\r\r\n![Trino_16_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino16900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### Trino 테이블 생성\r\r\n\r\r\nTrino 데이터 소스로 OBS를 사용하는 경우 Hive를 사용하기 때문에 HQL을 사용해야 합니다.

It provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes with enhanced performance to handle complex data in bulk. Parquet is available in multiple languages including Java, C++, Python, etc...\r\r\n\r\r\n여기서도 키워드를 뽑아보면 아래와 같습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n* column-oriented data\r\r\n* efficient data storage and retrieval\r\r\n* efficient data compression\r\r\n* encoding schema\r\r\n* handle complex data in bulk\r\r\n\r\r\ncolumn-oriented data의 설명은 아래의 그림을 보시면 이해가 쉽습니다.\r\r\n![Trino_11.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino11.png)\r\r\n(Source: [https://devidea.tistory.com/92](https://devidea.tistory.com/92))\r\r\n\r\r\n동일한 타입의 데이터가 나열되기 때문에 압축 효율이 높아지는 효과가 있습니다.\r\r\n또한 footer에 데이터에 대한 메타데이터를 저장해 두어 reader에게 데이터에 대한 힌트를 주어 조회 성능을 높입니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Trino_12.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino12.png)\r\r\n(source: [https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/](https://parquet.apache.org/docs/file-format/))\r\r\n\r\r\n## 구상안\r\r\n\r\r\nparquet는 columnar한 형식이기 때문에 row 단위로 데이터를 append하는 것은 비효율적입니다. 그러므로 데이터를 모아서 parquet 형식으로 파일을 생성하는 것이 효율적입니다. 이를 위해 NHN AppGuard에서는 3가지 구성 방법을 고려했고 3번째 안을 선택했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n1. micro batch\r\r\n    1. kafka → log-batch → create parquet / 1 minute → save obs → obs\r\r\n    2. trino는 OBS를 사용하는 경우 파일 기반으로 동작하기 때문에 파일의 개수가 많아지면 비효율적입니다.\r\r\n    3. 1분 단위로 파일을 쓸 경우 작은 파일이 많아져 조회 성능이 현저히 떨어지기 때문에 선택하지 않았습니다.\r\r\n2. hourly batch\r\r\n    1. kafka → log-batch → create parquet / 1 hour (save data in memory or redis) → save obs → obs\r\r\n    2. 메모리에 저장하는 경우 데이터 유실의 리스크가 걱정되었고\r\r\n    3. NHN AppGuard는 redis를 사용하고 있지 않아 trino와 redis 두 컴포넌트의 추가로 인한 운영 복잡도 증가가 부담되어 선택하지 않았습니다.\r\r\n3. **중간 DB 사용 - MySQL**\r\r\n    1. kafka → log-batch → save to mysql → mysql → tier down in daily-batch → save obs → obs\r\r\n    2. 기존에 사용하던 MySQL 구성을 변경하지 않아 수정 소요가 적었고\r\r\n    3. MySQL을 통해 실시간 데이터 또한 조회할 수 있어 실시간 데이터 조회가 쉬워 선택하였습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 구성도\r\r\n\r\r\n* AS-IS\r\r\n![Trino_13_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino13900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n* TO-BE\r\r\n![Trino_14_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino14900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### tier down 개념\r\r\n\r\r\nElasticSearch는 데이터의 역할 또는 접근 빈도에 따라 노드를 분배하는 기법으로 Data Tiering 을 사용합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n![Trino_15.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino15.png)\r\r\n(source: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-data-tiers-optimizing-costs-reducing-risk-boosting-lim-yfeyc](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/navigating-data-tiers-optimizing-costs-reducing-risk-boosting-lim-yfeyc))\r\r\n\r\r\n이렇게 tier를 적용한 데이터를 높은 티어에서 낮은 티어로 낮추는 것을 tier down이라고 부릅니다. hot tier는 일반적으로 성능이 좋고 반응이 빠르지만 비용이 비싸고, cold tier는 반응은 조금 느리지만 비용이 저렴한 저장소를 사용합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\nNHN AppGuard에서는 MySQL을 hot tier, Trino를 cold tier로 정의하고 daily-batch에서 MySQL 데이터를 Parquet로 변환해 Trino에 삽입시키는 작업을 tier down으로 정의했습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Parquet 파일 생성 방법\r\r\n\r\r\nParquet는 원래 HDFS에 쓰는 용도로 고안되어서 Parquet 파일을 직접 쓰려면 `org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:3.3.6`과 같은 hdfs writer에 세그먼트 관리, 열 압축 등의 기능을 구현해야 합니다. 이러한 작업을 피하기 위해 일반적으로 Spark 등의 외부 컴포넌트를 쓰거나 avro 포맷의 파일을 거쳤다가 parquet로 변환하는 방법을 사용합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n[Apache Avro](https://avro.apache.org)는 data를 serialize하기에 좋은 포맷으로 스키마를 갖습니다.\r\r\nParquetFileWriter를 지원하기 때문에 손쉽게 변환이 가능합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n> Apache Avro™ is the leading serialization format for record data, and first choice for streaming data pipelines. It offers excellent schema evolution, and has implementations for the JVM (Java, Kotlin, Scala, …), Python, C/C++/C#, PHP, Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, and even Perl.\r\r\n\r\r\n# Trino 적용 - 구현\r\r\n\r\r\n## tier down 구현\r\r\n\r\r\n### 논리 구조\r\r\n![Trino_16_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino16900.png)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n### Trino 테이블 생성\r\r\n\r\r\nTrino 데이터 소스로 OBS를 사용하는 경우 Hive를 사용하기 때문에 HQL을 사용해야 합니다. HQL 또한 SQL 표준을 따르기 때문에 거의 유사하지만 묵시적 형 변환과 같은 편의 기능을 지원하지 않고, with 문의 external location, partitioned_by 등의 옵션이 추가됩니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```sql\r\r\nCREATE TABLE log\r\r\n (\r\r\n    seq              bigint, \r\r\n    log_time         timestamp,\r\r\n    // 생략 \r\r\n    log_date         date,\r\r\n    appkey           varchar(64),\r\r\n ) \r\r\n WITH ( \r\r\n    format = 'Parquet',\r\r\n    external_location = 's3a://data-query/log',\r\r\n    partitioned_by = ARRAY['appkey','date']\r\r\n);\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### avro schema 작성\r\r\n\r\r\n```javascript\r\r\n{\r\r\n  \"type\" : \"record\",\r\r\n  \"name\" : \"log\",\r\r\n  \"namespace\" : \"avro\",\r\r\n  \"fields\" : [\r\r\n    { \"name\" : \"seq\", \"type\" : \"long\" },\r\r\n    { \"name\" : \"log_time\", \"type\" : [ \"null\", \"string\" ], \"default\" : null },\r\r\n    // 생략\r\r\n  ]\r\r\n}\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n### tier down process\r\r\n![Trino_17.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino17.png)\r\r\n데이터를 메모리에 올려서 변환하기 때문에 장비와 데이터에 따라 적절한 페이징을 적용해야 합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### convert to parquet\r\r\n![Trino_18.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino18.png)\r\r\navro 변환은 apache avro 모듈의 schema.from 함수로 쉽게 변환이 가능합니다. parquet는 apache parquet 모듈의 PositionOutputStream 객체의 writer를 구현하여 변환할 수 있습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### 다른 방법은 없을까?\r\r\nCTAS(Create Table As Select)가 가장 쉬운 방법입니다. 수행 시간은 위 방법과 비슷하게 소요되지만 용량이 30% 정도 더 효율적인 것으로 확인하였습니다. 하지만 DataQuery에서 사내 DB를 아직 데이터 소스로 지원하지 않아 현재는 사용이 어렵습니다.\r\r\n여기에서는 방법만 소개하겠습니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n```sql\r\r\nCREATE TABLE obs.test.log_ctas\r\r\n    WITH (\r\r\n        format = 'Parquet',\r\r\n        external_location = 's3a://ctas-test/log-ctas',\r\r\n        partitioned_by = ARRAY['log_date', 'appkey']\r\r\n        )\r\r\nAS\r\r\nselect seq,\r\r\n// 생략\r\r\n       cast(log_time as date) as log_date,\r\r\n       appkey\r\r\nfrom \"mysql\".log\r\r\nwhere log_time >= date '2024-11-01'\r\r\n  and log_time < date '2024-11-02';\r\r\n```\r\r\n\r\r\n## 실시간 데이터 union 구현\r\r\n\r\r\n### 논리 구성도\r\r\n![Trino_19_900.png](https://image.toast.com/aaaadh/real/2025/techblog/Trino19900.png)\r\r\n1. cold data에 마지막으로 저장된 시간을 조회하고\r\r\n2. cold data와 hot data를 조회해\r\r\n3. join / union 하여 응답합니다.\r\r\n\r\r\n### Data 조회\r\r\n\r\r\nCold -

        "contentSnippet": "📌 적용 배경\n이번에 회사에서 하는 프로젝트는 '오더 상태 관리'이다. '오더서밋, 오더취소, 배송, 오 더컨펌' 까지의 다양한 오더 상태에 대한 관리를 적용하는 프로젝트이다. \n우리 회사는 공급사 상품들의 묶음 단위인 딜을 이용해 주문을 한다. 상품이 있으니까 재고가 있겠지? 즉, 각 오더 상태의 역할별로 재고가 차감되거나 복원된다. \n오더 서밋시 : 재고 차감\n오더 취소시 : 재고 복원\n오더 컨펌시 : 재고 차감 / 재고 복원\n이러한 상태가 변경될때 각 딜에는 항상 중복되는 상품이 존재하기 때문에 동시성 문제가 발생하게 된다. 여기서 추가로 딜에는 여러 상품들이 있기 때문에 여러 상품을 동시에 락을 걸어야 하는 상황이다. \n📌 동시성 문제를 해결하는 방법\n여러가지 방법이 있는데 비관적락, 낙관적락, 분산락, 네임드락 등이 있다. 각각의 특징을 간단히 알아보자면,\n1) 비관적락(DB락)\nDB에서 직접 락을 걸어 다른 트랜잭션 차단\n장점 : 데이터 정합성 강하게 보장, 실시간 동시 수정 방지 가능\n단점 : 성능 저하(트랜잭션이 길어질수록 락 유지시간 증가), 데드락\n적용 예시) 은행 계좌 잔고 업데이트\n2) 낙관적락(버전 필드)\n충돌 감지 후 재시도 (rollback & retry)\n장점 : 락을 안걸어서 성능이 좋음\n단점 : 충돌이 빈번할 경우 계속 재시도하여 성능 저하를 일으킴. 정합성이 다소 낮음\n3) 분산락(Redis, Zookeeper)\n여러 서버에서 동일한 리소스를 동시에 수정하지 못하도록 제어\n장점 : 분산 시스템에도 동기화 가능\n단점 : 락 관리(해제, TTL 설정 등) 신경 써야 함, 분산 환경에서 네트워크 이슈로 인해 지연 가능\n우리 회사의 경우, 멀티 인스턴스 환경에서 오더상태 변경을 해야하고 재고관리에 있어서 강한 정합성을 요구하기 때문에 분산락을 적용하기로 결정하였다.\n📌 분산락\n분산락이란 무엇일까?\n앞서 언급했듯이 분산락은 여러 서버에서 동일한 리소스를 동시에 접근하지 못하도록 제어하는 것을 의미한다.(비관적 락이나 낙관적 락은 하나의 DB에서만 동작하는 락) 좀 더 기술적 용어를 사용해서 설명하자면, \n💡 분산락\n락을 획득한 프로세스 혹은 스레드만이 공유 자원 혹은 Critical Section 에 접근할 수 있도록 하는 것\n키(락)를 가진 사람(프로세스/스레드)만 보물이 있는 공간(공유자원)의 문을 열 수 있는 것이다 🗝\n분산락을 적용하는 방법은 여러가지가 있다. Redis, Zookeeper, MySql 등등.. 결론적으로 말하자면, 우린 Redis를 사용하였다.\n우선 Redis는 그동안 캐시용도로 이미 구성해놓은 반면에 Zookeeper는 추가적인 인프라 구성이 필요하기 때문에 제외하게 되었다. 그리고 알다시피 Redis는 싱글스레드로 작동하기 때문에 동시성 문제도 현저히 작다. 아 물론 Mysql도 있긴 한데, 락을 사용하기 위해 별도의 커넥션 풀을 관리해야 하고 락에 관련된 부하를 RDS에서 받으니 Redis를 사용하는 것이 더 효율적이다.\nRedisson을 사용한 이유는?\nRedis는 인메모리 데이터 저장소로 사용되지만 , 캐시 역할을 넘어서 다양한 분산 시스템 기능을 지원하는 구현제(라이브러리, 프레임워크)들이 존재한다. 그 중 난 분산락을 위한 구현체에 대해 간단히 알아보자면,\nJedis -> Lettuce가 성능이 더 좋아서 Lettuce로 대체됨\nLettuce\nRedisson\n1) Lettuce\nSpring Data Redis에서 기본적으로 사용하는 Redis 클라이언트\nsetnx를 활용한 스핀락 : 반복적으로 락 획득 시도 -> 레디스에 많은 부하 발생. CPU를 계속 사용하면서 재시도하는 방식\n락 획득 방식\n(1) SET NX 명령어로 락 획득을 시도\n(2) 락이 없으면 성공 → 작업 진행 후 DEL로 락 해제\n(3) 이미 락이 있으면 실패 → 일정 시간 대기 후 재시도 (스핀락 방식)\n(4) TTL(EX)을 설정하여 데드락 방지\n2) Redisson\n별도의 Lock interface를 지원 : RedLock, RLock(단일 인스턴스 락) 지원\n💡 RedLock\nRedis 기반의 분산 락을 더 안전하게 보장하기 위한 알고리즘\n멀티 Redis 노드 환경에서 장애 복구가 중요한 경우\n데이터 정합성이 중요한 글로벌 시스템\nRedis 장애가 발생해도 락을 유지해야 하는 경우\nRedLock은 과반수 이상의 Redis 노드에서 락을 획득해야 성공\nPub/Sub 방식을 이용하기에 락이 해제되면 락을 subscribe 하는 클라이언트는 락이 해제되었다는 신호를 받고 락 획득을 시도\nRedisson은 락 대기 및 해제 처리를 최적화하여 불필요한 CPU 낭비 없이 안정적으로 락을 관리\n락이 만료되기 전에 자동으로 TTL을 연장하여, 장시간 작업에서도 안정적인 락 유지가 가능\n( Lettuce는 TTL이 지나면 락이 풀릴 수 있어 작업 중 충돌 위험이 존재 )\n결론적으로, Lettuce보다 안정적인 분산 락이 필요했고, CPU 사용을 줄이면서 TTL 자동 연장과 다양한 락 기능을 활용하기 위해 Redisson을 선택하게 된것이다. 그럼 이제, RedLock을 이용할지, RLock을 이용해서 구현할지에 대한 고민이 생긴다.\nRedLock, RLock ? 어떤 것을 이용할까\n❌ RedLock이 과할 수 있는 경우\n싱글 Redis 노드 환경이거나, 락을 걸어야 하는 트랜잭션이 짧다면 RedLock은 오버헤드가 될 수도 있다\n단일 Redis 인스턴스 환경에서는 RedLock을 사용할 필요 없음\n과반수 노드가 죽으면 락 획득이 불가능해질 수도 있음\n현재 우리의 레디스 환경은 하나의 레디스 인스턴스에서 모든 데이터와 락을 관리하는 싱글 노드 형태이기 때문에 RedLock보다는 RLock을 선택하는 것이 낫다는 판단이 되었다.\n코드내에서 주목해야 할점\n코드 내에서 주목해야 할 점을 난 2가지를 뽑았다. \n1) RLock의 내부 코드 파헤치기\n2) 트랜잭션 분리\n🤔 RLock의 내부 코드 파헤치기\nRedission을 이용한 분산락 코드는 사실 인터넷을 조금은 서칭하면 거의 비슷하게 나온다. 그런데 정작 내부의 RLock의 코드를 파헤친 기록은 없더이다. 퇴근하고 남는게 시간인데 놀면 뭐하나,, 내부 코드 뒤적거리면서 시간이나 보내야지 ⏳\n적용한 코드를 크게 보면 간단하다\n락 객체 생성(열쇠 가져오기) → 락 걸기(열쇠로 잠그기) → 락 해제(열쇠로 잠금 풀기) \n1) 락 객체 생성(열쇠 가져오기)\n자.. 락 객체 생성부터 알아볼까?\n\n처음 시작은 getLock부터 시작한다. 이 코드를 따라가다보면, 최종적으로 RedissonLock 클래스의 생성자로 연결된다. \n\n첫번째 코드 줄을 통해, RedissonLock은 RedissonBaseLock을 상속받고, 기본적인 락 이름(name)과 명령 실행기(commandExecutor)가 초기화함을 알 수 있다. \n명령 실행기(commandExecutor)라는 것은 🎁 비동기 Redis 명령어 실행기를 의미한다. 음 Redis에 직접 명령을 보내는 역할인거다. 예를 들어 tryLock()을 호출하면, 내부적으로 SET NX PX 명령이 Redis에 전송되는 것이다. 그래서 명령 실행기를 초기화한다는 것은 commandExecutor를 통해 Redis와 통신할 준비를 한다는 거라고 생각하면 된다. \ninternalLockLeaseTime는 자동 락 해제 시간 설정하는 것이다. 여기서 우리가 주목해야 할것은 🎁 락 워치독 (Watchdog) 기능이다. 쉽게 말하면, 자동 연장 기능이다. \n📌 락 워치독(Watchdog)은 왜 필요할까?\n보통 Redis에서 락을 설정할 때 TTL(만료 시간)을 지정하는데, 작업이 TTL 안에 끝나지 않으면 락이 자동으로 해제되는 문제가 있다. \n예를 들어 TTL이 5초인데 작업이 6초걸린다고 치자. 5초 후 락이 만료되고 자동으로 해제되면?\n다른 프로세스가 같은 락을 획득할 수 있다 → 데이터 일관성 깨짐 😨\n그래서 락을 획득한 스레드가 살아 있는 동안 TTL이 자동으로 연장된다는 기능이다. TTL을 직접 설정하지 않으면 기본 30초 동안 유지된다고 한다. \n마지막 줄인 pubSub은 🎁 Pub/Sub 기능을 활용하여 락 해제 이벤트를 감지하는 역할이다. \nRedis에서 분산 락을 사용할 때, 다른 클라이언트가 락을 대기하는 방식에는 2가지 방식이 있다. \n폴링(Polling) 방식: 주기적으로 Redis를 조회해서 락이 해제되었는지 확인함.\n이벤트 기반 방식: 락이 해제될 때 Redis가 직접 알림(Pub/Sub)을 보내서 대기 중인 클라이언트가 즉시 실행됨.\n만약 폴링 방식이라면? 락을 얻으려는 클라이언트가 주기적으로 Redis에 요청을 보내 락이 해제되었는지 확인해야한다. 듣기만 해도, 불필요한 Redis 부하가 발생하고 클라이언트가 지속적으로 Redis에 요청을 보내므로 트래픽이 많아질 거라는 단점이 느껴지지?\n그래서 Redisson에서는 락이 해제될 때 이벤트를 발생시켜 다른 클라이언트가 즉시 실행될 수 있도록 처리한다. 언제? RLock.unlock() 이 호출될때!\n2) 락 걸기(열쇠로 잠그기)\n이제 락을 어떻게 거는지 알아보자. 코드를 따라가다보면 Redission 클래스에서 tryLock()의 구현체를 확인할 수 있다. \n코드에 대한 내용을 간단하게 정리하자면, \n주어진 대기 시간(waitTime) 내에 락을 획득하려 시도하며, 락을 획득하면 지정된 임대 시간(leaseTime) 동안 락을 유지한다. 락을 즉시 획득하지 못한 경우, 다른 클라이언트의 락 해제 이벤트를 대기하기 위해 Pub/Sub 메커니즘을 활용하고, 대기 시간 내에 락을 획득하지 못하면 false를 반환하는 매커니즘을 확인할 수 있다. \n\n3) 락 해제(열쇠로 잠금 풀기)\n비동기적으로 락을 해제하는 모습을 볼 수 있다. 앞서 언급했듯이  Redisson에서는 락이 해제될 때 이벤트를 발생시켜 다른 클라이언트가 즉시 실행될 수 있도록 처리한다 -> 이부분을 찾기 위해 코드를 엄청 뒤졌는데 사실 해당 역할을 하는 코드를 찾을 수가 없어서 좀 아쉽다..ㅠ\n\n🤔 트랜잭션 분리\n코드를 살펴보면 락을 걸고 나서 트랜잭션을 분리해서 비즈니스 로직을 실행하는 역할을 하는 것을 볼 수 있다. \n\n음..쉽게 말하면 DistributedLock 어노테이션이 선언된 메서드를 별도의 트랜잭션으로 실행하게 만든 코드인 것이다. \n\nPropagation.REQUIRES_NEW 옵션을 지정해 부모 트랜잭션의 유무에 관계없이 별도의 트랜잭션으로 동작하게끔 설정하고 반드시 트랜잭션 커밋 이후 락이 해제되게끔 처리하고 있다. 왜 이렇게 분리를 했을까?\n해당 내용은 컬리의 블로그에 너무 자세히 써져있다. 내가 진행한 프로젝트도 재고를 위한 분산락인데 여기서도 재고를 예시로 들어서 너무나 적절하게 써져있으니 해당 링크 참고하길 바란다. 결론을 말하자면 데이터 정합성을 위한 방법으로 트랜잭션 커밋 이후 락이 해제되게끔 처리 해놓았다. \n📌 추가된 요구사항\n실전으로 넘어가기 전에, 추가할 요구사항이 있다. 앞선 요구사항은 하나의 key 즉, 하나의 row만 락을 거는 형식으로 구현되어 있다. 하지만 우리 회사 특성상 주문시 여러 상품을 동시에 상태 변경하기 때문에 한번에 여러 상품의 재고를 변경해야한다. 따라서 하나의 row가 아닌 여러 row에 락을 걸어야 한다. \n그렇다면 기존에 받는 키도 하나에서 여러개를 받게 되고 락도 동시에 여러개를 건다는 말이겠지? 정리하자면, 여러 개의 락을 동시에 걸고, 하나라도 실패하면 전체 실패하도록 하고 싶다는 것이다. 이때 난 RedissonMultiLock이라는 것을 사용했다. \n\n즉, 하나의 트랜잭션처럼 모든 락이 성공해야만 실행되도록 할때 사용된다. 그렇다는 말은 락을 해제할때도 한꺼번에 해제한다는 말과 동일하다. \n이제 추가된 요구까지 알아보았으니 본격적으로 테스트를 해볼까? 해당 내용은 다음편에 있다. \n참고) \nhttps://velog.io/@a01021039107/%EB%B6%84%EC%82%B0%EB%9D%BD%EC%9C%BC%EB%A1%9C-%ED%95%B4%EA%B2%B0%ED%95%98%EB%8A%94-%EB%8F%99%EC%8B%9C%EC%84%B1-%EB%AC%B8%EC%A0%9C%EC%9D%B4%EB%A1%A0%ED%8E%B8\nhttps://helloworld.kurly.com/blog/distributed-redisson-lock/\nhttps://techblog.woowahan.com/17416/\nhttps://velog.io/@jinony/Spring-Boot-Apache-JMeter%EB%A5%BC-%EC%9D%B4%EC%9A%A9%ED%95%9C-%EB%B6%80%ED%95%98-%ED%85%8C%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "이 블로그에서 ‘개밥 먹기’에 대해서는 지난 18년 동안 셀 수 없을 정도로 많은 글을 썼는데, 그만큼 제품을 만드는 창업가들에겐 본인이 만든 제품을 1부터 100까지 직접 다 사용해 보는 게 중요하다는 말이다. 내가 만든 제품을 출시하기 전에 내가 하나씩 사용해 보고, 혹시 이상한 건 없는지, 치명적인 버그는 없는지, 이런 점들을 남이 발견하기 전에 먼저 발견하고, 매일 우리 제품을 사용하면서 조금씩 개선하는 작업은 창업가들이 절대로 소홀히 하면 안 되는 필수 작업이다.\n사업을 하다 보면 챙겨야 할 것들이 한두 개가 아니다. 특히, 요새 같이 어려운 시기엔 회사에 피 같은 자금이 고갈되지 않게 대표이사는 합법적으로 할 수 있는 모든 일을 해서 직원들 월급이 밀리지 않게 해야 하고, 직원들의 사기가 떨어지지 않게 여러 가지 동기 부여 방법에 대해서도 고민해야 한다. 이 외에도 신경 써야 할 것이 너무 많아서 돌아버릴 지경이지만, 아무리 바빠도 대표를 비롯한 전 직원이 절대로 하루도 멈추면 안 되는 게 우리 제품 사용하기, 즉, 우리 개밥 먹기다. 하루도 빠지지 않고, 우리가 고객을 위해서 만들고 있는 제품을 매일 실행하고, 매일 사용해야 한다. 혹시나 기능이 잘 못 되지 않았을까, 숨은 버그가 있지 않을까, 서버가 다운되지 않았을까 등, 하루 종일 우리 제품을 사용하면서 모니터링 해야 한다.\n어떻게 보면 이 개밥 먹기는 너무나 당연한 스타트업의 첫 번째 법칙인데, 또 이만큼 잘 안 지켜지는 원칙도 없는 것 같다. 실은, 스트롱의 포트폴리오들도 이 비난을 피해 가기가 어렵다. 얼마나 본인들이 만드는 제품을 안 쓰면, 아주 심각한 에러가 발생한 것도 모르다가 나 같은 투자자가 그 제품을 사용하면서 한참 후에 발견한 오류를 제보해 주면, 그제야 “아, 그런가요?” 하면서 원인 파악을 시작해 본다. 새로운 기능이 출시됐다고 언론에 PR까지 때리면서, 막상 대표에게 그 기능에 대해서 자세히 물어보면 본인도 잘 사용 안 해봤다면서 PM과 나를 연결해 준 경우도 있다.\n소프트웨어 회사에서는 마이크로소프트가 ‘개밥 먹기’라는 용어를 처음 쓰기 시작했는데, 내가 마이크로소프트 다녔던 짧은 기간 동안 가장 인상 깊었던 건, 오피스 제품을 담당하는 글로벌 부사장이 오피스 제품의 기능을 하나씩 데모하면서 청중의 질문에 모두 답변했던 기억이다. 그만큼 이분은 본인이 몸담고 있던 회사에서 만든 제품을 구석구석 다 사용하면서 개밥을 열심히 먹었다는 의미다. 실은 한 조각도 남기지 않고 샅샅이 다 핥아먹었는데, 그때 정말 인상 깊었던 기억이 난다.\n우리 제품을 제대로 사용하지 않는 대표와 그 회사의 모든 직원은 깊이 반성해야 한다. 그 어떤 작가라도, 본인 책의 첫 번째 독자는 작가 그 자신이다. 작가가 쓴 책을 스스로 읽었는데 본인이 그 책이 맘에 안 든다면, 다른 독자는 말할 것도 없다. 이와 마찬가지로, 우리가 만드는 제품의 첫 번째 고객은 이 제품을 만드는 우리 회사의 임직원들이다. 우리가 만든 제품을 우리도 사용해 보지 않았는데, 이걸 어떻게 자랑스럽게 고객에게 보여주고 심지어 돈을 받고 판매할 수 있겠는가?\n우리가 만든 제품을 구석구석 꼼꼼히 사용해 보면, 분명히 만족스럽지 못한 것들이 있을 것이고, 수많은 버그를 발견할 것이다. 내가 만든 제품의 첫 번째 고객인 내가 수많은 버그를 발견한다면, 이 제품을 제대로 사용하지 못할 것이다. 그리고 우리가 만든 제품의 첫 번째 고객인 우리 회사 사람들도 우리 제품을 제대로 사용하지 못하면, 우리조차 우리 제품을 사랑할 수가 없다.\n이런 개 허접한 제품을 우린 어떻게 시장에 출시하고, 어떻게 주위 사람들에게 사라고 강요하겠는가? 절대로 이렇게 해선 안 되는데, 실은 너무나 많은 스타트업이 이런 말도 안 되는 짓을 매일 한다. 너무 많은 스타트업이 본인들도 제대로 사용해 보지 않은 거지 같은 제품을 출시한다. 그러면서 모두 다 대박 나는 유니콘을 꿈꾼다. 모두 다 꿈 깨시길.\n에어비앤비의 공동창업가 Brian Chesky 대표가 요샌 어떻게 사는지 잘 모르겠지만, 그는 2022년까지 집 없이, 에어비앤비에서 여기저기 숙소를 예약하면서 1년 내내 살았다. 이 세상 모든 집을 살 수 있을 정도의 재산이 그에겐 있지만, 사장은 회사가 만드는 제품을 눈감고도 외울 수 있어야 한다는 그의 철학 때문이다. 그가 항상 농담처럼 하던 말이 “저는 말 그대로 아직도 우리 사이트에서 살고 있습니다(I still live on the site).” 였는데, 에어비앤비 사장이 집이 없고 회사 웹사이트에서 살고 있다는 건 정말 시사하는 바가 크다고 생각한다. 이보다 훨씬 더 작은 대부분의 한국 스타트업의 대표와 임직원들은 눈 감고도 본인들의 제품이 어떻게 작동하는지, 어떤 UI와 UX를 거쳐서 어떤 결과가 나오는지, 줄줄 외워야 한다. \n내가 만든 개밥의 첫 번째 고객은 나 자신이다. 내가 만든 개밥을 내가 맛없어서 못 먹는다면, 그 누구도 이걸 맛있게 먹을 수 없을 것이다.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "10년마다 오는 큰 tech 물결을 잘 예측하고, 기회의 파도의 고점을 잘 타이밍 하면, 엄청나게 큰 사업을 만들 수 있다는 것을, 과거를 보면 잘 알 수 있다. 1960년대에 반도체의 미래를 보고 인텔이라는 회사가 만들어졌고, 이 반도체를 어떻게 활용할지 고민하면서 1970년대에 애플, 마이크로소프트, 오라클과 같은 회사들이 personal computer 시장을 만들면서 엄청난 기업으로 성장했다. 그 이후에 10년마다 아주 큰 기술의 물결이 출렁거렸는데, 1980년대 인터넷의 탄생, 1990년대 메인스트림 인터넷 서비스의 등장(구글, 아마존 등), 그리고 데스크탑에서 모바일로의 패러다임 변화 등이 이런 큰 물결이다. 중간 중간에 다양한 회사들이 등장했고, 이 중 성공한 곳들이 많지만, 정말 대박급으로 성공한 회사들은 모두 다 “앞으로 10년 동안 어떤 기술의 물결이 올까?”를 예측하고 여기에 베팅한 곳들이라고 난 생각한다.\n앞으로 10년은 어떤 테마가 거대한 유니콘들을 탄생시킬까? 이미 이 테마는 AI로 정해진 것 같다. 이렇게 많은 돈이 짧은 시간 동안 한 테마에 투입되는 걸 우리가 과거에 본 적이 없을 정도로 요새 AI 분야에 큰 투자와 관심이 집중되어 있다. 분명히 AI 분야에서 엄청난 혁신이 일어날 것이고, 이 혁신을 적극적으로 수용하는 회사들이 앞으로 미래를 이끌어 갈 것이다.\n여기에 나는 디지털 결제라는 테마를 하나 더 추가하고 싶다. 과거 10년 동안 세상의 모든 기술이 비약적으로 발전했다. 사람을 닮은 로봇이 등장하고, 사람 없이 스스로 운전하는 자율주행 자동차가 하늘을 날기도 하는데, 이런 변화 속에서 유독 돈이 움직이는 방법과 기술엔 큰 발전이 없었다. 아니, 디지털 결제는 오히려 여러 가지 면에서 후퇴하고 있는 것 같다. 특히, 돈이 국경을 넘어가는 과정과 이를 가능케 하는 기술을 보면, 우린 삶의 구석구석에 internet of everything을 적극적으로 도입하지만, 유독 internet of money는 구현되지 않는 것 같다.\n내가 합법적으로 열심히 번 돈을 사용하거나, 투자하거나, 또는 다른 사람에게 보낼 때, 우린 기술이 덜 발달했고, 인터넷이 없던 시절과 크게 다르지 않은 규제를 극복해야 하고, 오히려 그때보다 더 복잡한 인증 절차를 거쳐야 한다. 기술의 발전으로 우리 생활에서 많은 규제가 완화되고, 불필요한 비용을 발생시키는 중개인들이 줄었는데, 오히려 돈이 움직이는 프로세스를 보면 규제는 더 많아졌고, 아직도 불필요한 중개인들이 하는 것도 없이 수수료를 챙기고 있다. 돈세탁 방지와 고객확인제도는 디지털화가 아니라 오히려 더 아날로그화되어 가고 있다.\n이걸 내가 전혀 이해 못 하는 건 아니다. 돈은 정말 중요하고, 이 중요한 돈이 이동하면 – 특히, 국경을 넘으면 – 여러 가지를 신경 써야 한다. 통화는 나라마다 다르고, 그 통화를 지배하는 법과 규제는 가는 곳마다 다르므로, 범죄가 발생할 수 있는 구멍이 가장 많은 게 금융 쪽이다. 금융 범죄자들은 더 똑똑해지고, 악랄해지고, 대범해져서, 우리가 지금까지 경험하지 못했던 금융 범죄가 계속 등장하고, 이런 범죄를 막아야 하는 인공지능 기술이 오히려 더 많은 범죄를, 더 지능적으로 만드는데 악용되고 있기도 하다. 그러면, 정부 당국은 새로운 범죄를 차단하고 예방하기 위해서 더욱더 빡빡하고 엄격한 법과 규제를 만들 것이고, 이 과정을 거치면서 디지털 결제는 더욱더 아날로그화되면서 기술로부터 멀어질 것이다.\n나는 이 문제를 해결할 수 있는 건 블록체인 기술과 디지털 자산이라고 확신한다. 지난 10년 동안 internet of money와 digital network of money를 만들기 위해 이 분야의 다양한 이해관계자들이 노력을 많이 했는데, 솔직히 매번 규제에 부딪히거나, 인간의 탐욕에 스스로 굴복했다. 하지만, 10년 동안의 시행착오를 거치면서, 기술은 발전했고, 이 시장을 바라보는 시각도 많이 변했다는 걸 요샌 체감한다. 특히, 이번에 다 바뀐, 미국 SEC에서 디지털 자산을 담당하는 공무원들이 시장의 의견을 적극 수용해서 현실적으로 적용 가능한 법과 규제를 잘 만들면, 이게 한국을 포함한 전 세계의 표준이 되지 않을까,,,개인적으로 은근히 기대하고 있다.\n물론, 아직도 사기꾼들은 많고, 이 분야에서 일어나면 안 될 사기가 너무 많이 발생한다. 그래서, 내가 이런 이야기를 하면, 잘 모르는 분들은 코인 생각을 할 것인데 절대로 내가 밈코인이나 잡코인을 옹호하는 건 아니다. 나는 오히려 이젠 변동성의 리스크가 어느 정도 제거된 스테이블코인과 이 자산의 움직임과 투명성을 더 강화할 수 있는 기술을 연구하면서 좋은 디지털 결제 제품을 개발하는 창업가들이 앞으로 10년 동안 엄청난 사업을 만들 수 있을거라고 생각한다.",
