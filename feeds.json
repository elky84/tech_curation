We are excited to see you all at CppCon this year, where we’ll once again be delivering a variety of presentations, from the latest advancements in debugging technology to extensibility frameworks for AI agents. See the end of this post for a listing of all of the sessions involving Microsoft staff. And yes, there’ll be plenty of information on the freshly announced Visual Studio 2026.\nWe’ll also have a booth through the first four days of the conference. Come on by and let us know what matters to you or ask any burning questions you may have regarding C++ at Microsoft. We will be well stocked with our most popular swag, so come on by and have a chat with us. There may even be appearances by speakers in case you didn’t get a chance to ask that all important question after their session.\nOur annual survey is now open and will be available all week throughout the conference. It’s super lightweight, and upon completion, CppCon attendees will be entered into a raffle for one of four great prizes. You do have to be onsite for the daily drawing to win (see official rules here), but even if you aren’t going to be at the conference, you can still complete the survey to let us know what you think of our C++ products. New this year on the survey is an option to select a dedicated time to talk with Microsoft staff about the topics you care about. So, if you don’t want to lose your voice in a crowded expo hall you can find that right time that fits into your busy schedule.\nTry out Visual Studio 2026 Insiders – Get Started Here\nVisual Studio 2026 and MSVC Build Tools v14.50 Preview are already available on the Insiders Channel (which replaces the previous Visual Studio 2022 Preview channel), with a Stable Channel going live later in 2025. We want to hear from you at CppCon about your experiences with Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, so give it a spin and come chat with us about your experiences.\nTalks from Microsoft employees (and friends)\nMonday 15th​\nBuilding Secure C++ Applications: A Practical End-to-End Approach, by Chandranath Bhattacharyya & Bharat Kumar\nTuesday​ 16th​\nWhat’s New for Visual Studio Code: CMake Improvements and GitHub Copilot Agents, by Alexandra Kemper\nWhat’s New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers in 2025, by David Li and Augustin Popa\nBack to Basics: Code Review, by Chandranath Bhattacharyya and Kathleen Baker\n​Wednesday 17th\nConnecting C++ Tools to AI Agents Using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), by Ben McMorran\nLLMs in the Trenches: Boosting System Programming with AI, by Ion Todirel\nWelcome to v1.0 of the meta::[[verse]]!, by Inbal Levi\n C++ Performance Tips: Cutting Down on Unnecessary Objects, by Prithvi Okade and Kathleen Baker\n Thursday 18th​​\nMSVC C++ Dynamic Debugging: How We Enabled Full Debuggability of Optimized Code, by Eric Brumer\nIt’s Dangerous to Go Alone: A Game Developer Tutorial, by Michael Price\nFriday 19th​​\nReflection-based JSON in C++ at Gigabytes per Second, by Daniel Lemire and Francisco Geiman Thiesen\nDuck-Tape Chronicles: Rust/C++ Interop, by Victor Ciura\nThe post Microsoft C++ Team at CppCon 2025 appeared first on C++ Team Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "GitHub releases are fantastic for distributing your open-source projects, as they let you turn any code revision into ready-to-go assets with a detailed version history. What makes them particularly popular, though, is that they give users a proper Download button (because not everyone dreams of compiling source code).\nIn TeamCity, the traditional approach for publishing GitHub releases is to run custom scripts via the Command Line build step. While certainly viable, this approach comes with a catch: You need to write and maintain that script and handle authentication on your own. Even more frustrating, TeamCity already has a perfectly good authentication token tucked away in your VCS root – an authentication token that you cannot directly reuse.\nThe new GitHub Releases Support plugin aims to eliminate this inconvenience once and for all. No more guesswork, no more custom scripting. With just a few clicks, you can publish your builds as GitHub releases and focus on shipping features instead of wrangling scripts.\nInstall\nThis is an unbundled plugin, which means you’ll need to download it from our Marketplace and install it on your server. To do this, click the Get button in the top right corner of the plugin page, or go directly to the Admin | Plugins page of your TeamCity server and click Browse plugins repository.\nSee also: Installing Additional Plugins\nConfigure\nOnce the plugin is installed, you can add the GitHub Release step to build configurations as you would any other build step.\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a quick overview of the key settings:\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease Repository – The GitHub repository where your release will be published. TeamCity automatically lists repositories based on the VCS roots attached to the parent build configuration.\nRelease Tag – The unique tag to label your new release. Use a parameter reference (%teamcity_parameter_name%) to fetch this value from a TeamCity parameter. You can provide this value before the build starts (via the Run Custom Build dialog) or calculate it during a build.\nRelease Title and Release Notes –  Additional details that are optional, but highly recommended. Your users will appreciate a concise description and some context. You can import the content for these fields from TeamCity parameters and let GitHub append its own auto-generated notes to your custom ones.\nAsset Paths – Files you want to publish as release assets. If you’ve run the build before, you can simply browse and select files using the folder browser instead of typing paths manually.\nRelease Options – A field where you can mark the release as a draft or pre-release, or flag it as the latest release.\n\n\n\n\nThe plugin supports multiple authentication methods, seen in the Commit Status Publisher or similar TeamCity build features.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse VCS root credentials — Reuse the same authentication method your VCS root already uses.\nAccess Token — Provide a personal GitHub access token, issued on your GitHub profile settings page.\nGitHub App access token — Use an existing GitHub App token, or create a new one, directly from TeamCity. See this documentation article for more information.\nKotlin DSL\nFor those who enjoy configuration as code, here’s how the step settings look in the Kotlin DSL:\ngitHubRelease {\n    name = \"Publish release\"\n    targetVcsRootId = \"${myVcsRoot.id}\"\n    githubUrl = \"https://api.github.com\"\n    tagName = \"v%release.version.number%\" // Supports parameter references\n    releaseName = \"Release %release.version.number%\" // Optional, uses 'tagName' if omitted\n    releaseNotes = \"\"\"\n            ## Changelog:\n            %release.changelist%\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    // Optional, specified files will be uploaded as release assets.\n    // Paths are relative to the checkout directory, files should be present when this step runs\n    assetPaths=\"\"\"\n            library/build/libs/library-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n            app/build/libs/app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar\n        \"\"\".trimIndent()\n\n    latest = true // Optional, labels the published release as the latest one\n    authType = vcsRoot()\n}\nRun\nOnce everything is set up, hit that big blue Run button.\nWhen the build finishes, you’ll see a Release Details section on the Build Results page. From there, click the provided link to open your freshly minted GitHub release. (Cue a sigh of relief, and maybe a small celebration.)\n\n\n\n\nYour Feedback Matters!\nThe GitHub Releases Support plugin may not come bundled in TeamCity, but we hope you find it as handy as many of the bundled ones.\nHave any ideas or requests? Would you like to give our developers a virtual high-five? Drop by JetBrains Marketplace to leave a review, or get in touch through our regular feedback channels. We listen closely to user requests and always value your feedback.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "The ICPC World Finals 2025 in Baku was an unforgettable event, and we were honored to be part of it once again. It’s always a joy to see the brightest students from across the globe. The Finals reminds us why supporting the ICPC is such a vital mission – it’s about community, talent, and the future of technology.\n\n\n\n\nThis year, the Finals brought together the brightest students and ICPC teams from around the world, and we were glad to see that participants from the JetBrains-supported program at Neapolis University Pafos (NUP) also qualified to compete among the best. Their team, Sigma++, proudly represented their university in Baku and was awarded an Honors distinction at the World Finals.\nIn his welcome speech, Andrey Ivanov, Senior VP of People, Research, and Investments at JetBrains, highlighted what makes the ICPC so special for us:\n\n“What I enjoy most about the ICPC and all its events is the feeling of a growing family and community. Every year we meet wonderful people – last year in Astana, this year here in Baku – and I know our paths will cross again and again.”\n\nHe also expressed gratitude to everyone who made the event possible:\n\n“I want to thank all the organizers for making this event possible. The spirit of the ICPC is alive thanks to your efforts, and it’s a real joy to see such an incredible setting for the Finals here in Baku.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHis words reflected our long-standing commitment to the ICPC and the values we share with its community.\n\n\n\n\nHighlights from JetBrains at the Finals\nThe booth and chillzone areas\nThroughout the Finals week, we met with participants in two locations. At our booth, they enjoyed tackling the Kotlin Challenge, tested their predictions for the Finals outcomes, sent postcards to family and friends, and posed with Kodee. We also talked about JetBrains tools, including our new AI agent Junie, which we presented for the first time to such a large global ICPC audience.\nIn the bustling JetBrains chillzone area, participants tried the new Nav&Code Challenge (where one teammate sees the screen and the other types), snapped instant team photos, and took part in a fun quiz about JetBrains and the ICPC. They also tested their skills in our super-fun Junie challenge, where teams prompted Junie to build an app from a mockup, with twist cards adding surprises. \nThis setup worked especially well because, for the first time in years, all participants were staying in the same hotel – a unique opportunity that made it possible to create a shared space with our photo wall and activities. Right after the quiz and the Junie challenge, a participant came up to us and said:\n\n“I just wanted to thank you for being here. It’s JetBrains that creates this amazing atmosphere.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth locations became lively hubs where contestants, coaches, and volunteers connected and shared their excitement for the competition. Another familiar detail was JetBrains notebooks on every team’s desk, a tradition we’ve maintained for years at both the ICPC Finals and regional contests. These special notebooks help participants structure their thoughts on paper during the contest – much like our tools support them in writing great code.\nJetBrains Tech Trek and Kotlin Heroes\nThe highlight of our presence at the Finals was the JetBrains Tech Trek. JetBrains Developer Advocate Sebastian Aigner opened the session by introducing Junie, our smart coding agent. He then talked about JetBrains IDEs that help in competitions and real-world development, providing students and teachers with access to modern development tools and AI in classrooms worldwide. Sebastian also explored how Kotlin – one of the official ICPC languages – is used in education and industry, and can now help with building modern AI libraries using koog.ai, a new Kotlin framework for building AI agents.\nThis seamlessly led into the live stage contest, where two of the world’s top competitive programmers, Andrew ‘ecnerwala’ He and David ‘SecondThread’ Harmeyer, went head to head in a live coding race on stage. They were solving problems from the Kotlin Heroes: Episode 13 practice round, now open to all. The main contest will take place on September 12, which means you still have time to register and compete for a chance to win a T-shirt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking ahead\nIn addition to demonstrating the power of algorithms and teamwork, the Finals in Baku reinforced the sense of community that connects ICPC participants worldwide. We were inspired to see students work hard, collaborate, discover solutions under time pressure, and just have fun together.\nWe were especially proud to see the majority of participants who had joined our Pafos Programming Camp 2025 in August. Eight of the teams made it into the top 50 worldwide:\nUniversity of Novi Sad – 11th place, bronze medal 🥉\nKarlsruhe Institute of Technology – 13th place (Highest Honors)\nUniversity of Maryland – 14th place (Highest Honors), with 7 out of 9 elegant solutions written in Kotlin\nHasso Plattner Institute – 29th place (High Honors)\nUniversità di Pisa – 39th place (High Honors)\nDelft University of Technology – 40th place (Honors)\nJagiellonian University in Krakow – 42nd place (Honors)\nUniversity of Wroclaw – 43rd place (Honors)\n\n\n\n\nThe full scoreboard can be found here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s fantastic to see how well the teams prepared for the Finals, and we’re glad that Pafos Camp was part of their journey.\nWe congratulate all the medalists and finalists who made it to Baku. To every participant, coach, and organizer – thank you for your energy, passion, and determination!\nHere’s to another year of the ICPC, to many more collaborations, and to the friendships and ideas that will keep growing beyond the Finals. Stay tuned for what’s next – and we’ll see you at future contests, camps, and challenges!",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Introduction\nAI coding agents are no longer research experiments. They are quickly becoming practical tools that can help developers solve real problems. \nBut how do you know whether an agent is good enough for serious use? How do you measure progress when its answers are not always predictable and when there may be various correct solutions to the same task?\nThis is where systematic testing comes in. At JetBrains, we needed a way to test our own coding agent, Junie, on real-world development tasks. To achieve this, we built an evaluation pipeline powered by TeamCity and SWE-bench, a popular benchmark that provides real bugs and fixes from open-source projects.\n\n\n\n\nIn this post, I will walk you through how it works, the challenges we faced, and the solutions we found.\nPrerequisites\nIn our GitHub project, you can find a repository that contains the TeamCity Kotlin DSL and describes every component you need. You can plug it into your own TeamCity and run the full pipeline, just as I’ll demonstrate in this blog post.\n👉 Check out and fork the project 👈\nWhy this matters\nTesting AI coding agents is not like testing ordinary software. With regular programs, you can rely on unit and integration tests. With agents, things are different. Their output can vary from run to run, and there are often multiple valid ways to solve the same problem. This makes traditional testing methods ineffective.\nTo use coding agents effectively, you must answer a few critical questions: Are the results correct? Are they consistent over time? What does each run cost in compute and API usage? \nAt JetBrains, Junie’s team tracks metrics such as solved-task percentage, cost per run, common failure types, and performance across versions. This data provides clear evidence of progress and ensures that development decisions are based on facts rather than impressions.\n💡Read also: How Junie Uses TeamCity to Evaluate Coding Agents\nSWE-bench: Your benchmark toolkit\nBenchmarks give us a consistent way to test agents. SWE-bench is one of the most widely used because it is based on real issues from real projects. For every task, we know:\nThe exact project and commit where the problem appeared.\nThe correct fix.\nTests that prove both the bug and the solution.\nThe evaluation method is straightforward: Provide the agent with the project and task, let it propose a fix, run the tests, and see if they pass. SWE-bench also provides Python tooling to prepare Docker images with the correct dependencies and environments, as well as scripts to evaluate solutions.\nIn our project, we used SWE-bench Lite, a smaller variant of the full benchmark. The pipeline is flexible, so you can adapt it to any benchmark you prefer.\nBuilding stable, reusable pipelines\nOne of the biggest challenges is ensuring that every run happens in a stable, identical environment. Without this, it is impossible to know whether a failure was due to the agent or some minor setup difference.\nWhy stability matters\nTo reproduce each task, we must download the code, install dependencies, and prepare the environment. Any external hiccup, like a slow package server or rate limits on Hugging Face (which hosts the datasets), can cause tasks to fail incorrectly.\nThe Hugging Face bottleneck\nIf every TeamCity agent downloads datasets directly from Hugging Face, the requests quickly hit limits. This results in HTTP 429 errors and failed runs – not because the agent was wrong, but because the dataset could not be retrieved.\nThe solution: Caching with artifacts\nTo fix this, we created a dedicated TeamCity job that downloads the dataset and tooling once, packages them into ZIP archives, and publishes them as artifacts. All other build configurations use these cached artifacts instead of contacting Hugging Face.\nThe dataset download build type uses a Python script to cache the SWE-bench Lite dataset:\n# Download the dataset with caching\ndataset = load_dataset(\n    \"princeton-nlp/SWE-bench_Lite\",\n    cache_dir=cache_dir,\n    split=\"test\"\n)\nSource: scripts/download_dataset.py\nThe build configuration packages the cache as artifacts:\nartifactRules = \"\"\"\n    dataset_cache/** => dataset_cache.zip\n    .venv => venv.zip\n\"\"\".trimIndent()\nSource: SWE_bench_Lite.kt\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits include:\nNo more rate limits.\nFaster builds with less wasted time.\nMore reliable runs.\nConsistent datasets across all tests.\nDocker image caching\nWe extended this same caching approach to Docker images. Each task gets its own image with the project source code, Python version, dependencies, and test environment. These images are cached and reused. When new tasks are added, only their images are rebuilt.\npython {\n    name = \"Build Docker image for $taskId\"\n    command = module {\n        module = \"swebench.harness.prepare_images\"\n        scriptArguments = \"--instance_ids $taskId --tag $instanceImageOrigTag\"\n    }\n}\n\ndockerCommand {\n    name = \"Save Docker Image for $taskId\"\n    commandType = other {\n        subCommand = \"save\"\n        commandArgs = \"-o $taskId.tar $instanceImageOrig\"\n    }\n}\nSource: SWE_Bench_lite_TaskEnv.kt \nThis ensures stability and lowers costs, and it has the added advantage of making results reproducible.\n\n\n\n\nCost-efficient and scalable execution\nThough possible, running hundreds of tasks at once is wasteful. Instead, we built configurations that run smaller subsets: 10 tasks, 30 tasks, or 50 tasks.\n\n\n\n\nThe project creates different-sized task sets for cost-efficient testing:\nval tenTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\nval thirtyTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\nval fiftyTasksSet = mutableListOf<Task>()\n\ntasks.forEachIndexed { index, task ->\n    val taskConfiguration = createTaskForGeminiBuildType(task)\n    if (index % 10 == 0 && tenTasksSet.size < 10) tenTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n    if (index % 7 == 0 && thirtyTasksSet.size < 30) thirtyTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n    if (index % 5 == 0 && fiftyTasksSet.size < 50) fiftyTasksSet.add(taskConfiguration)\n}\n\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(tenTasksSet, agentGemini))\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(thirtyTasksSet, agentGemini))\nbuildType(create_SWE_Bench_Lite_XxTaskSlice(fiftyTasksSet, agentGemini))\nSource: Google_Gemini_CLI_AI_Agent.kt \nThis setup gives us flexibility: Daily runs can use the smaller sets for quick checks, while strong-performing agents can be scaled up to larger runs. If an agent fails early, we can stop immediately and save resources.\nThe 10-task run in particular works like a build verification test. It is fast and inexpensive, yet still provides statistical insight into the agent’s health.\nInfrastructure stability and resource control\nBy caching datasets and Docker images, our pipelines no longer depend on unstable network downloads. Failures now reflect the agent’s quality, not infrastructure problems.\nTeamCity’s resource management features also help us control concurrency. Since providers may limit request rates, we can set a maximum number of parallel agent runs. This prevents overload, avoids provider errors, and keeps the evaluation system available for everyone on the team.\nThis defines a shared resource with a quota of 20 concurrent connections, which limits how many builds can simultaneously access Hugging Face services, preventing rate limit issues:\nsharedResource {\n    id = \"HuggingFaceConnections\"\n    name = \"HuggingFaceConnection\"\n    resourceType = quoted(20)\n}\nSource: settings.kt\nfeatures {\n    sharedResources {\n        readLock(\"HuggingFaceConnection\")\n    }\n}\nSource: SWE_Bench_Lite_TaskEnv.kt\nA summary of the benefits\nWith this setup, we gain:\nEconomy: We can reuse datasets and environments efficiently.\nStability: The setup leads to fewer random failures.\nReproducibility: Runs are carried out in identical environments.\nTrustworthy metrics: Results reflect agent performance rather than noise.\nFlexibility: The Kotlin DSL makes it easy to generate hundreds of configurations.\nVisibility: We gain clear insight into agent quality over time.\nPower: TeamCity proves itself useful beyond CI/CD by serving as a robust testing platform.\nOur pipeline automatically tags runs with visual indicators for quick assessment:\nresolved_instances = data.get('resolved_instances', 0)\nunresolved_instances = data.get('unresolved_instances', 0)\nerror_instances = data.get('error_instances', 0)\n\nif resolved_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '✅ Good solution']\")\nif unresolved_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '❌ Bad solution']\")\nif error_instances > 0 or empty_patch_instances > 0:\n    print(\"##teamcity[addBuildTag '  Error']\")\nSource: scripts/tag_task_execution.py\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe built a reliable and efficient system for testing AI coding agents with TeamCity and SWE-bench Lite. Repeatable, cost-effective, and adaptable, the pipeline provides reliable metrics.\nTeamCity is not just for continuous integration and deployment – it is also an excellent platform for evaluating AI agents.\nYou can find all repositories and resources linked in our project.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Starting with version 2025.2.1, CLion now supports Junie, the AI coding agent by JetBrains, thanks to an integration that is currently in Beta.\nDevelopers working on embedded systems, projects written in C or C++, or performance-critical software can now experience the full benefit of Junie’s project insights and tooling, directly in CLion. With Junie, you get the structure and visibility you’ve been missing. No more grepping through build logs or reverse-engineering target configs – Junie does it all.\nLet’s take a look at what makes this integration so powerful and why it’s great news for C and C++ developers.\nTRY JUNIE IN CLION\nThe power of Junie in CLion\nJunie, the AI coding agent created by JetBrains, gives developers deep visibility into projects and helps supercharge their development workflows, right inside the IDE. It was built to address their specific needs, independently completing tasks like testing code, fixing bugs, bootstrapping and prototyping, searching inside projects, writing behavioral specifications and documentation, describing execution paths, and more! By bringing Junie into CLion, we’re providing a unified experience. Now, you get all the benefits of Junie without ever leaving your IDE.\n\n\n\n\nWhat you can do with Junie in CLion\nGet answers\nYou can put Junie in Ask mode, and it will then answer any questions you give it about modules, directories, execution paths, project setup and configuration, and other complex topics. To fully understand the context of your project, Junie uses many of the tools available in the IDE, such as Search Everywhere, the file structure, code analysis, and more.\n\n\n\n\nAsking about a method’s functionality\nAsk mode is designed for question-and-answer tasks. If you want Junie to change code or create files, use Code mode.\nGenerate README\nJunie can help you understand your codebase and project structure, and it can even generate README files for this purpose. Below is an example of generating a README file for one of the demo projects shipped with the Bullet Physics SDK:\n\n                        \n\n\nGenerating a README for a C++ project\nUse Code mode to generate tests\nIn Code mode, you can have Junie create tests that use frameworks such as GoogleTest, Catch2, or CppUnit.\n\n                        \n\n\nCreating a Google test\nJunie will even run the tests for you, and when a test is done, you will receive a report detailing all the files Junie modified or created:\n\n\n\n\nJunie’s report about the test results\nIf you’re not satisfied with the test implementation, you can undo the changes by clicking the Rollback button in the Junie tool window.\nReview your code and fix bugs\nYou can ask Junie to review your code changes to ensure they are correct before you commit them. Junie will examine different aspects of your changes, including behavior and compatibility, code quality, and style. Junie will also share recommendations for improvements.\n\n                        \n\n\nReviewing code changes\nIn Code mode, Junie can fix any bugs it finds and immediately test the solution. After updating files, Junie provides links that allow you to view the code changes in the Diff Viewer. You can then accept or reject the results.\nGive Junie more autonomy\nIn Code mode, Junie requires your approval to make potentially sensitive changes, execute terminal commands, and perform other actions. However, if you trust Junie and don’t want to spend effort on micromanaging its decisions, you can enable Brave mode in the task window. This mode will allow Junie to execute all actions without your approval.\n\n\n\n\nEnabling Brave mode\nBrave mode can save you time and is helpful, for example, when you need to execute certain routine tasks regularly.\nImplement guidelines\nYou can document testing scripts, third-party tool usage, and development guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md at the project root. Junie will then follow these guidelines while working on every task. You can either add the file manually or ask Junie to generate it for you.\nCurrent limitations\nJunie doesn’t yet work well with remote or WSL toolchains. The Beta release of this Junie integration mainly focuses on CMake projects, so you may need to manually reload the project model for other project types. We’ll notify you as soon as these issues are addressed.\nStart using Junie in CLion today \nGetting Junie set up in CLion is simple. There are three main options to make it happen: \nInstallation from the JetBrains AI widget﻿\nInstallation from the in-IDE Marketplace﻿ tab\nInstallation from disk\nFor more details to help you choose the installation option that best fits your needs, take a look at our general guidelines, and if you have any additional questions, check out the documentation.\nWe value your feedback! If you have anything to share or if you run into any problems, please let us know through our issue tracker.",

You can now provide icons using factory methods, and the platform has been updated with a range of enhancements.\nDOWNLOAD MPS 2025.2\nImportant notice: Update the MPS merge driver\nWe’ve changed the logic in the MPS merge driver, which detects the persistence approach used for individual files, and we’ve also dropped a few old persistence hacks. It is important to allow MPS to update the merge driver when it detects that an older version is specified in your projects.\n\nWhat’s new\nCheck out all the updates available in the latest release.\nBinary launchers for Windows and Linux\nMPS now includes native binary launchers for Windows and Linux. These launchers provide a more robust and convenient way to start MPS than the script-based launchers, for example, by allowing you to pin the application to the taskbar and to the start menu.\ncreate updated build scripts, so you don’t need to take any additional action when working on a new project.\nAdding binary launchers and product-info.json to existing build scripts\nIf you’re updating an older MPS-based distribution to include the new binary launchers, please follow the steps mentioned in the documentation.\n\nFactory method icons\nIn addition to the existing TextIcon, FileIcon, and ConstantFieldIcon concepts, a new FactoryMethodIcon concept is now available. It allows an icon to be specified by reference to a concrete static factory method declaration that creates and returns an instance of javax.swing.Icon.\n\nResolve-info updated during copy-paste\nResolve-info is now correctly updated when copying references to the clipboard. When you rename the target of a reference, such as a variable, without using the Rename refactoring, the resolve-info of references pointing to that target will not be updated. However, as soon as you copy such references to the clipboard, their resolve-info gets updated correctly, and the references will be correctly re-resolved when pasted.\nRaising the bar to Java 21\nMPS is keeping pace with the evolving Java ecosystem. In this release, we’ve updated both the source and target compatibility to Java 21, unlocking access to new language features and improved runtime performance.\nMore new features…\nCheck out the What’s New page to learn all about the new features.\nhere.\nGive all the new features a try, and let us know what you think.\nYour JetBrains MPS team",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "You have probably seen this picture occasionally and wondered what is happening with your IDE and why it freezes! This is a tricky question, and many types of bugs and performance issues may lead to UI freezes.\nJetBrains IDEs are built on top of a UI framework (the Java AWT) that uses a single thread, the event dispatch thread (EDT), to perform painting operations and process user input events.\nA UI freeze occurs when the IDE cannot execute operations on the EDT, preventing interaction with the IDE. This blog tries to consolidate our knowledge about freezing reasons and causes. Use it to investigate and resolve UI freezes in your IDE plugins!\nThe IntelliJ Platform’s UI architecture\nBecause our UI frameworks are built on top of a single thread, it is important to keep the EDT from remaining blocked for a long time. The EDT runs an event loop that processes AWT events. Typical examples of these events are user input (such as typing or moving the mouse) and repaint requests from Swing.\nEvents need to be processed within 16 ms. Otherwise, the IDE is not able to render 60 frames per second.\nInvestigating UI freezes\nIn the vast majority of cases, simply looking at the thread dump will give you the information you need about a UI freeze. The investigation should start with the thread AWT-EventQueue-N – this is the EDT. Normally, its name should be AWT-EventQueue-0. If you see a bigger number in the suffix, there might be a platform issue.\nIn the event of a UI freeze, the EDT is usually blocked on some kind of lock.\nFreezes caused by the read-write lock\nIf you are unfamiliar with the concept of the IntelliJ Platform’s read-write lock, you can learn more about it from this notebook.\nDue to the IntelliJ Platform’s architecture, the write lock is often acquired on the EDT. Since it often isn’t possible to acquire the write lock immediately, you will sometimes see the following lines in the stack trace of the EDT:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer@3a946cba\nat java.base@21.0.8/java.lang.Object.wait0(Native Method)\n...\n(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.upgradeWritePermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:370)\n...\nat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:921)\n...\nat com.intellij.ide.IdeEventQueue.dispatchEvent(IdeEventQueue.kt:347)\n...\nat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThe key line here is marked with (!). This line indicates that the EDT is blocked on the acquisition of the write lock. In this case, there is no need to look above. The IntelliJ Platform usually enters emergency mode if it detects a UI freeze and runs some of its internal procedures.\nThe EDT being blocked on the write lock is a sign that a thread is running under the read lock. The next step in our investigation is to find this background thread. This can be done by searching for a substring readAction (case-insensitive) in the thread dump.\nFor example, we may find the following thread:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 1/11\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 runnable\n     java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.QuantifierNounCompatibility.<clinit>(QuantifierNounCompatibility.java:38)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.AgreementSet.<clinit>(AgreementSet.java:42)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.PluralsInCompounds.<clinit>(PluralsInCompounds.java:21)\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.en.Articles.<clinit>(Articles.java:250)\n\t...\n\tat ai.grazie.rules.toolkit.LanguageToolkit.allParameters(LanguageToolkit.java:87)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.grazie.pro.TreeRuleChecker.calcParameters(TreeRuleChecker.java:234)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.codeInsight.daemon.impl.AnnotatorRunner$$Lambda/0x00000070047e8000.run(Unknown Source)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.tryRunReadAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:826)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nThis thread is taken from ForkJoinPool, and we see that it is currently running a read action (at (!)). We also see AnnotatorRunner in the stack trace, which means that this thread is currently running highlighting. The read actions in highlighting are canceled on a pending write action, which means that the UI freeze is caused by the code not checking for ProgressManager.checkCanceled. In the middle of the block, we see some traces from the Grazie plugin (starting from (!!)). This concludes our investigation. We’ve found the problem – Grazie does not check for checkCanceled frequently enough, which causes the UI to freeze.\nFreezes caused by a background write action\nThe IntelliJ Platform gradually moves write actions to background threads, but this functionality is currently unstable, and it can cause additional UI freezes and deadlocks.\nWhile a write action can run in the background, the EDT still often acquires a write-intent lock, resulting in stack traces like the following:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #91 [119043] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=71985.87ms elapsed=1065.05s tid=0x00000001610c4c00 nid=119043 sleeping [0x0000000398429000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (sleeping)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.sleep0(java.base@21.0.8/Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport$ComputationState.acquireWriteIntentPermit(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:416)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nThis means that the EDT cannot immediately acquire a write-intent lock. Our next step is to search for a write action. In this case, it may appear in coroutine dumps. For example:\n- \"RefreshQueue pool\":StandaloneCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5, Rete(abortOnError=false, commands=capacity=2147483647,data=[onReceive], reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516, dbSource=ReteDbSource(reteState=kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlowImpl@6d763516)), DbSourceContextElement(kernel Kernel@lumrbnr1s12qelije7p5), ComponentManager(ApplicationImpl@106897812), com.intellij.codeWithMe.ClientIdContextElementPrecursor, Dispatchers.Default.limitedParallelism(1)]\n\tat com.intellij.core.rwmutex.WriteIntentPermitImpl.acquireWriteActionPermit(RWMutexIdea.kt:263)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl.processEventsSuspending(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:191)\n  ...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.vfs.newvfs.RefreshQueueImpl$queueAsyncSessionWithCoroutines$3$1.invokeSuspend(RefreshQueueImpl.kt:177)\nHere we see that a coroutine is SUSPENDED on acquisition of the write lock. In particular, VFS refresh cannot proceed, which means that a read action is alive. Indeed:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 7/9\" #201 [175107] daemon prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=153605.15ms elapsed=1039.57s tid=0x0000000142955a00 nid=175107 runnable  [0x00000003610e7000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: RUNNABLE\n\tat com.intellij.psi.impl.file.impl.MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.get(MultiverseFileViewProviderCache.kt:67)\n\t...\n\tat org.jetbrains.kotlin.idea.codeInsight.lineMarkers.KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.collectSlowLineMarkers(KotlinRecursiveCallLineMarkerProvider.kt:35)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(java.base@21.0.8/ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nHere we again arrive at the conclusion that some code cannot be canceled due to the read action. The process of resolving this freeze is similar to what we have discussed above.\nSuvorovProgress\nSometimes the EDT is blocked in a class named SuvorovProgress:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer@215bb938\n\tat java.base@21.0.7/java.lang.Object.wait0(Native Method)\n\tat java.base@21.0.7/java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:366)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.EternalEventStealer.dispatchAllEventsForTimeout(SuvorovProgress.kt:261)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.SuvorovProgress.processInvocationEventsWithoutDialog(SuvorovProgress.kt:125)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.progress.util.SuvorovProgress.dispatchEventsUntilComputationCompletes(SuvorovProgress.kt:73)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.lambda$postInit$14(ApplicationImpl.java:1434)\n\tat com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl$$Lambda/0x000076ace059cff8.invoke(Unknown Source)\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.RunSuspend.await(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:1517)\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupportKt.runSuspendWithWaitingConsumer(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:1472)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:921)\n\t...\n\tat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.pumpEvents(EventDispatchThread.java:105)\n\tat java.desktop/java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nSuvorovProgress is merely a symptom of a UI freeze, however. It indicates that the IntelliJ Platform is in emergency mode, where it is still able to run certain trusted AWT events or draw a freeze popup UI.\nIt is very rarely a cause of a freeze, so the problem is likely somewhere else.\nFreezes caused by thread starvation\nThe IntelliJ Platform uses the Kotlin Coroutines library a lot. In coroutines, there are two major thread pools: Dispatchers.Default and Dispatchers.IO. Both are bounded, with Dispatchers.Default containing as many threads as there are cores in your machine and Dispatchers.IO containing 64 threads. If all these threads are blocked on some operation, then the IDE encounters thread starvation – a situation where coroutine machinery cannot progress because all threads in a thread pool are blocked.\nThe usual symptom of thread starvation is coroutines being stuck in the Cancelling state. They cannot move into Cancelled because they cannot execute cleanup actions on their respective thread pools.\nTo investigate thread starvation of the Default dispatcher, you need to find all blocked threads that contain runDefaultDispatcherTask.\nFor example:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-9@28483\" daemon prio=5 tid=0xa0 nid=NA waiting\n  java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Unsafe.java:-1)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.parkNanos(LockSupport.java:269)\n\t...\n\t\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Builders.kt:48)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt.runBlocking$default(Unknown Source:1)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.platform.pluginManager.frontend.BackendUiPluginManagerController.awaitForResult(BackendUiPluginManagerController.kt:293)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler.runSafely(CoroutineScheduler.kt:610)\n\t(!) at kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runDefaultDispatcherTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:882)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.executeTask(CoroutineScheduler.kt:906)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.runWorker(CoroutineScheduler.kt:775)\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:762)\nIf there are as many such threads as cores in your machine (at (!)), then you have signs of thread starvation. Similarly, if you’re dealing with thread starvation of the IO dispatcher, you’ll have 64 blocked threads named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N.\nNB: It is not enough to look at all threads that are named DefaultDispatcher-worker-N to conclude that there is thread starvation of the Default dispatcher. The coroutine scheduler shares physical threads between the Default and IO dispatchers, so it is difficult to say which thread belongs to which dispatcher without actually looking at the source code.\nTo fix thread starvation, blocking operations need to be moved out of the Default dispatcher. Here we see that runBlocking is used in the line with (!!), and it needs to be moved to a different dispatcher.\nFreezes caused by service initialization\nAnother frequent source of locks in the IntelliJ Platform is service initialization. Since services are initialized once, a thread that tries to access a service can block while waiting for initialization on another thread.\nHere’s an example of this scenario:\n\"AWT-EventQueue-0\" #59 [128003] prio=6 os_prio=31 cpu=3011.23ms elapsed=172.40s tid=0x000000012c07ae00 nid=128003 waiting on condition  [0x000000039b0ae000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING (parking)\n\tat jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImplKt.runBlockingInitialization$lambda$9(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:1660)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.serviceContainer.ComponentManagerImpl.getService(ComponentManagerImpl.kt:672)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.XDebuggerManager.getInstance(XDebuggerManager.java:32)\n\t...\n\t(!!!) at com.intellij.platform.locking.impl.NestedLocksThreadingSupport.runWriteAction(NestedLocksThreadingSupport.kt:939)\n\t...\n\tat java.awt.EventDispatchThread.run(java.desktop/EventDispatchThread.java:92)\nWe see that the EDT is blocked on the initialization of a service in the line marked (!). The service is XDebuggerManager (at (!!)), so there might be something wrong inside it. Additionally, we note that this process is running under the write action (at (!!!)), an observation that will be useful later.\nBy searching for XDebuggerManager, we can find the following thread:\n\"DefaultDispatcher-worker-4\" #55 [130051] daemon prio=5 os_prio=31 cpu=1537.10ms elapsed=172.41s tid=0x000000012b883c00 nid=130051 in Object.wait()  [0x000000036b607000]\n   java.lang.Thread.State: WAITING (on object monitor)\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait0(java.base@21.0.7/Native Method)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.runReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1028)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.breakpoints.XBreakpointManagerImpl.loadState(XBreakpointManagerImpl.java:536)\n\tat com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:388)\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.xdebugger.impl.XDebuggerManagerImpl.loadState(XDebuggerManagerImpl.java:81)\n\t...\n\tat com.intellij.configurationStore.ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.initComponentBlocking(ComponentStoreWithExtraComponents.kt:43)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.scheduling.CoroutineScheduler$Worker.run(CoroutineScheduler.kt:765)\nThe service instance initialization at (!!) tries to acquire the read lock (at (!)). The problem is clear – the write action on the EDT is blocked on the lock in service init, and service init is blocked on the read lock acquisition. This is a deadlock because of the incorrect order of the two locks.\nThe best way to fix it is to move the read action out of service initialization. If this is not possible, you can preload the service in the read action. This way, service initialization will inherit read access.\nHow to deal with runBlocking\nSometimes, you may notice that a thread is blocked in runBlocking. This means that it is trying to execute coroutines synchronously.\nFor example:\n\"JobScheduler FJ pool 6/15\" prio=0 tid=0x0 nid=0x0 waiting on condition\n     java.lang.Thread.State: TIMED_WAITING\n on kotlinx.coroutines.BlockingCoroutine@41813fd4\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n\t...\n\tat kotlinx.coroutines.BuildersKt__BuildersKt.runBlocking$BuildersKt__BuildersKt(Builders.kt:85)\n\t...\n\t(!) at com.intellij.openapi.progress.CoroutinesKt.runBlockingCancellable(coroutines.kt:117)\n\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner.run(CheckerRunner.kt:53)\n\t...\n\t(!!) at com.intellij.openapi.application.impl.ApplicationImpl.tryRunReadAction(ApplicationImpl.java:1206)\n\t...\n\tat java.base@21.0.8/java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread.run(ForkJoinWorkerThread.java:187)\nFirst, we need to make sure that runBlockingCancellable is present (at (!)). This is a special platform version of runBlocking that works well with our cancellation machinery.\nSince this thread runs the read action (at (!!)), we now need to figure out why it cannot be canceled. To do this, we need to look in the coroutine dump and search for the coroutine tree starting with BlockingCoroutine (this is the name of the coroutine corresponding to runBlocking). Here’s what we find:\n- JobImpl{Active}\n\t- BlockingCoroutine{Active}@41813fd4, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:69)\n\t\t- DeferredCoroutine{Active}, state: SUSPENDED [ModalityState.NON_MODAL, ComputationState(level=0,thisLevelLock=com.intellij.core.rwmutex.RWMutexIdeaImpl@1c825ccf,isParallelizedRead=true), BlockingEventLoop]\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.SentenceBatcher$forSentences$1.parseAsync(SentenceBatcher.kt:96)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.CloudOrLocalBatchParser.parseAsync(CloudOrLocalBatchParser.kt:20)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.ParsedSentence$Companion.getSentences(ParsedSentence.kt:104)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker.checkExternally$suspendImpl(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:18)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.ml.grazie.pro.AsyncTreeRuleChecker$Style.checkExternally(AsyncTreeRuleChecker.kt:48)\n\t\t\tat com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner$run$1$deferred$1$1.invokeSuspend(CheckerRunner.kt:56)\nWe see that this coroutine runs at com.intellij.grazie.text.CheckerRunner, which means that this BlockingCoroutine corresponds to runBlocking in the above trace. Now we can inspect the coroutine tree and try to find out the cause of the freeze.\nSince the state of the coroutine is DeferredCoroutine{Active}, it is not canceled. This means something is wrong with cancellation in the platform, as the platform should cancel all read actions on an incoming write action; hence, all coroutines should also be canceled. Normally, we should see BlockingCoroutine{Cancelling} here. \nTo fix this UI freeze, we need to figure out why the coroutine cannot transition to the {Cancelled} state. Most likely, the code does not call ProgressManager.checkCanceled() frequently enough.\nConclusion\nIn this blog post, we explored common sources of UI freezes in IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform. Most often, the freezes are caused by insufficient cooperation between plugin code and the IntelliJ Platform. By using the IntelliJ Platform’s primitives for executing cancellable operations, we can greatly improve the responsiveness of JetBrains IDEs.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Note: This is a guest post from John Arundel, a Go writer and teacher who blogs at bitfieldconsulting.com. His most recent book is The Deeper Love of Go.\nHow do you break it to someone that they’ve wasted most of their life? Well, I worked with a guy who didn’t know how to copy and paste. Every time he wanted to move some code, he’d delete it and then grimly re-type the whole thing somewhere else, as I watched in silent dismay: “How do I tell him?”\nIt wasn’t that he didn’t want to be able to copy and paste. He just had no idea that he could – he’d never taken the time to fiddle around and find out.\nThat guy is all of us, in a way. Even if we can copy and paste, what other editor superpowers are we missing out on? And how much time are we wasting by not knowing about them? I’m just going to confidently say “Some”, right?\nA modern IDE is more than just a text editor – it’s also a file manager, debugger, linter, AI assistant, and so on. Even better, an IDE like GoLand actually understands Go, so it can make suggestions as you type, highlight errors, annotate your code, and refactor automatically.\nHere are ten things you might not know GoLand can do, and each one will make you more productive as a Go developer.\nSearch everywhere\n90% of software engineering is just finding stuff, I reckon: where is that function defined? Where did I put that struct type?\nDouble-tap the Shift key in GoLand and type to search everywhere”: definitions, symbols, filenames, or even editor features. For example, enter search to see all search-related settings.\n\n\n\n\nGo to implementation\nCmd-click a function or variable name and GoLand will take you straight to its definition, even in another package or file (or even the standard library or your dependencies). And you can keep drilling down further until you find what you need, then use Cmd-[ to jump back.\n\n\n\n\nStructure view\nFor a high-level overview of your constants, functions, types, and their associated methods, press Cmd-F12 to open the Structure view of your file or package. Click on any item to go to its definition.\n\n\n\n\nParameter names\nGoLand shows inline hints for function calls, giving parameter names for each function argument. This makes reading code easier, especially when arguments are nil, for example. You’ll also see name hints for results in a return statement, and field names for struct literals that omit them.\n\n\n\n\nErrors and warnings\nSure, GoLand can point out compile errors – an angry red underline indicates the offending code, and you can hover the mouse over it to see what’s wrong (or use the Inspection Lens plugin to see all errors inline without hovering). Saved you a compile-edit-fix cycle.\nThat’s great, but GoLand will also warn you about probable mistakes: unreachable code, unhandled errors, unused functions, redundant type conversions, or variable names that shadow the name of a package. Even though they’re technically legal (the best kind of legal), they’re likely not what you meant, and GoLand will pick these up and offer to auto-fix them.\n\n\n\n\nNil pointer analysis\nAh, pointers! The cause of – and solution to – all programming problems. Specifically, pointers can be nil (meaning “doesn’t point to any value”). That’s a problem if you try to dereference such a pointer (that is, ask Go to give you the value it points to), and by “problem” I mean “horrible crash”.\nBut how can you tell whether a pointer will be nil at run time without running the program? Only by understanding the complete history of that variable throughout the code. Unfortunately, even GoLand isn’t yet smart enough to *touches earpiece* and I’m being told that in fact GoLand is now smart enough to do that.\nThe experimental data flow analysis feature simulates the execution of your program to catch run-time errors like nil pointers even before you run it. That’s something I’ve never seen before in an IDE, and it’s pretty impressive.\n\n\n\n\nCompletions and templates\nYou’d expect GoLand to offer inline completions of function and variable names and so on, but that’s table stakes. Even more powerful are live templates: parameterized code snippets you can insert and complete interactively.\nFor example, if you want to write a for ... range loop, type for, and select For range loop from the picklist (or type forr and press Tab). You’ll get a skeleton for loop with placeholders for you to fill in the loop variables and body.\nSimilarly, if you get bored typing if err != nil... repeatedly (but how could anyone find that boring?) GoLand can fill in the error-handling block for you, if you ask nicely.\nLive templates automate dozens of the most common Go patterns and idioms, and you can create your own, with placeholders like $INDEX$ for parameters you want users to fill in.\nAlso, if you have a blob of JSON data that you need to turn into a Go type, just paste it into the editor. GoLand will offer to generate the struct definition for you automatically, complete with json tags to make it parseable.\n\n\n\n\nRefactoring\nDo you ever wish you’d named your child something different? It might be a bit late to revisit that one, but fortunately it’s always possible to rename things in your Go programs, like functions and variables.\nManually retyping them everywhere would be annoying, and normal search-and-replace is error-prone (the Scunthorpe problem). GoLand is smarter about this because it understands Go: it knows if a word is a variable or function name, and avoids replacing it if it’s in some other context like inside a string or a comment.\nAlso, you can edit a function’s signature, adding or removing parameters as you like, and GoLand will automatically change the calls to that function everywhere.\nOr try this one weird tip to slim down your chubby functions, and make your code beach body ready: select some lines and use Extract method to replace them with a call to a method that does the same thing. By eliminating paperwork, you make the program more readable and focus on what’s actually relevant.\n\n\n\n\nDebugging\nNow, I’m not saying you ever write bugs – perish the thought. Shall we say rather that programs occasionally don’t behave exactly the way we expect them to? Figuring out just where and why things are going wrong can be difficult, unless you can shrink down to the size of an electron and go inside the computer to see what’s happening (I’m still waiting on that Kickstarter).\nFailing this, though, GoLand’s debugger is a pretty acceptable substitute. For example, set a breakpoint on a suspicious line and the debugger will stop the program there, keeping all variables intact so that you can inspect them (or edit them). Breakpoints can be conditional, too, so you only stop if a certain expression is true.\nThen, if the problem still isn’t clear, you can Step Over to continue executing the code line by line, or Step Into to follow function calls down the rabbit hole.\nTo get really inside baseball, you can set a watch on the variables you’re interested in, or even arbitrary Go expressions, and see their values change as the program runs.\n\n\n\n\nJetBrains AI tools\nYou were expecting this, right? Everything has AI now (or as I like to say, “Everything’s computer”). GoLand’s optional AI Assistant plugin is there, not to supplant your wonderfully human intelligence, but to support it.\nFor example, you can highlight some code and ask the assistant to explain it,  suggest refactorings, or generate tests. You can ask it questions about the language or the standard library – all those “at this point I’m afraid to ask” things, and it won’t judge you.\nNaturally, you can also use Junie, the JetBrains AI coding agent, as part of GoLand. You can ask Junie to write whole packages or programs for you, or to read a bunch of user requirements and sketch out a system design, then implement it.\nIf there’s some project you’ve always wanted to write, but you aren’t sure how to get started, collaborating with Junie could get you unblocked. Think of Junie as a pair programmer who doesn’t get bored or lose focus, and who can help you out with program structure and algorithms while still letting you have the fun of writing the interesting parts yourself.\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more\nWhat’s that? Ten superpowers aren’t enough for you? You’ve got some attitude, mister. Look, GoLand can do more than we’ve had time to cover here – a lot more. But these ten things are a great place to start. Once you’ve mastered them, feel free to explore: read the docs, click around, try stuff out.\nDon’t be like my non-copy-pasting friend, always too busy cutting wood to stop and sharpen the saw. A few minutes a day invested in really learning your IDE is time well spent. Pretty soon, these superpowers will become part of your muscle memory, just like copy and paste. (GoLand has that too. You’re welcome.)",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Watch behind the scenes of the Profiler Agent\nHead on over to the Copilot Profiler Agent to watch.\n\n\nWe’re excited to announce the Copilot Profiler Agent available in Visual Studio 2026 Insiders, it’s an AI-powered performance assistant built directly into Visual Studio. Forget staring at endless call trees or walls of mysterious numbers that leave you asking, “where do I even start?” The Copilot Profiler Agent changes that.  \nInstead of raw data, you now get an AI partner that not only points out the real bottlenecks but also explains what’s going on, suggests fixes, writes benchmarks, and even validates improvements all in a smooth, guided loop. \nIt’s like having a performance engineer sitting next to you. Without the coffee runs. And starting today, it’s ready for action in the latest version of Visual Studio, powered by GitHub Copilot. Download Visual Studio 2026 Insiders today.\n\nCopilot Profiler Agent \nMeet the Copilot Profiler Agent \nThe Profiler Agent is the first-of-its-kind AI assistant in Visual Studio, designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot. \nHere’s what it can do for you:\nAnalyze CPU usage, memory allocations, and runtime behavior\nSurface the most expensive bottlenecks in your code\nGenerate new BenchmarkDotNet benchmarks (or optimize existing ones)\nSuggest actionable performance improvements you can apply instantly\nValidate fixes with before/after metrics, all in a smooth guided loop\nAnd the best part, it’s as easy as asking a question in Copilot Chat. You can:\nTag it directly: @profiler Why is my app slow?\nOr just ask in plain language in Copilot agent mode: “Why is my frame rate dropping?”\n(Just make sure the Profiler Agent is enabled in the Copilot Chat tool menu.)\nNow, let’s take a look at it in action. In the demo below, you will see I pointed the agent at an existing benchmark in SharpZipLib and asked it to optimize. From there, it handled everything: running the benchmark, guiding me through the changes, applying targeted performance fixes, and validating the results by re-running the benchmark. The result was a measurable performance improvement, all from a single prompt.\n\nReal Code. Real Impact\nWhen we set out to build the Copilot Profiler Agent, we knew one thing for sure: showing it off on a “hello world” app wasn’t going to prove anything. Real developers don’t struggle with toy code. The real test was whether it could handle messy, performance-critical, production-grade projects. \nSo we aimed high: pointing the Profiler Agent at the top 100 most widely used open-source libraries and applications the kind of code that powers frameworks, services, and apps you probably use every single day. \nThe results blew past our expectations. The Profiler Agent : \n Surfaced hidden bottlenecks you wouldn’t spot on your own \nSuggested practical, actionable fixes \n Auto-generated benchmarks to validate improvements \n Turned insights into real pull requests on real projects \nWe’ve already contributed PRs to CSVHelper, NLog, Serilog, and more all powered by the Profiler Agent’s insights. \nAnd the feedback from the community says it all: \nSaw the YouTube video and it is almost magical. Amazing how it was able to recognize that multiple expression-compiles could be merged into a single expression-compile.– NLog Maintainer \nWe’ll be publishing a detailed case studies soon, walking through exactly how the Profiler Agent tackled these projects step by step. \nThis isn’t just OSS, either. We rolled out the Profiler Agent for internal dogfooding across Microsoft teams, and the results have been equally eye-opening. \nHere’s one story from a Principal Engineer: \nI had a class that wrapped a dictionary and exposed a limited set of operations. I wanted to support foreach on the class, so I added IEnumerable<TKey, TValue>, but this caused a big jump in memory use and execution time compared to iterating directly over the inner dictionary. After several prompt iterations with the profiler agent, it nudged me toward the realization that .NET supports duck typing for foreach. I didn’t need IEnumerable at all just exposing GetEnumerator that forwards to the inner dictionary worked.  \nHonestly, I’m not sure I would have figured this out on my own. I even asked several principal-level engineers with deep .NET experience, and none of them knew about this either. When focused on allocation optimization, the profiler agent does a great job of spotting improvements. \nWhat’s Next \nThis is just the beginning. The Profiler Agent currently supports high CPU usage analysis and .NET object allocations and memory usage analysis and more coming soon. \nWe’re excited to see how you use this in your own workflows whether it’s tuning a game engine, optimizing a service, or just speeding up a slow UI. So please try it out and don’t forget to Share your results by taking this short survey.  \nStay connected with the Visual Studio team by following us on Twitter @VS_Debugger, Twitter @VisualStudio, YouTube, and LinkedIn.\nDemocratizing profiling, one performance wins at a time.   \n \n \n \nThe post Democratizing Performance: The Copilot Profiler Agent in Action on Real Code appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "content:encodedSnippet": "Watch the Visual Studio 2026 Insiders release party\nHead on over to the Visual Studio YouTube channel to watch.\n\nVisual Studio 2026 Insiders is here – and it marks one of the most ambitious steps forward we’ve taken with the IDE.\nThis release brings AI woven directly into the developer workflow, performance improvements that reset expectations for speed at enterprise scale, and a modern design that makes the environment feel lighter and more focused.\nAnd for the first time, we’re introducing the new Insiders Channel, which replaces the long-standing Preview Channel as the way developers can get early access to upcoming features.\nThis is a release you can feel the moment you start using it – download the Insiders release and check out the release notes and see for yourself. And don’t miss out on Copilot Free to unleash the full power of AI in Visual Studio 2026.\n﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Sorry, your browser doesn’t support embedded videos.It’s all part of a simple but powerful goal: keeping developers in flow so you can spend less time fighting the tooling and more time solving the hard problems that matter. The IDE is made by developers, for developers – and you will always be at the center of the experience. Here’s a teaser of some of the things you can find in this new version:\nAI Integrated Development\nAI in Visual Studio 2026 isn’t bolted on. It’s woven into the daily rhythms of coding. Think of it as a quiet partner that knows your solution, respects your muscle memory, and offers help that’s timely rather than intrusive.\nYou’ll notice it when you drop into a new codebase and the IDE helps you understand what you’re looking at, suggests the kinds of tests that usually get written in your repo, and keeps your docs and comments in step with your code. You’ll feel it when a “paste and fix” moment becomes a single confirmation because the editor adapts the snippet to your project’s patterns and conventions. And when performance questions pop up, you won’t be guessing – guidance is grounded in real traces and validated with benchmarks, so fixes come with confidence, not hope.\nCode reviews start with clear, actionable insights about correctness, performance, and security – on your machine, before you ever open a pull request. Through it all, you stay in control. The IDE takes the busy-work; you keep the judgment. The result is simple: you move faster, and your code gets better.\n\nThe Profiler Agent can identify and fix performance issues in your code.\nBlazing fast performance\nSpeed shapes what you can build in a day. In 2026, the loops you run most – opening solutions, navigating code, building, and pressing F5 – tighten up. You’ll notice that first launch feels snappier, big solutions feel lighter, and the time between an idea and a running app keeps shrinking. The gains show up on large codebases and they hold across both x64 and Arm64, so your machine’s power turns directly into developer velocity.\nYou’ll feel it when you can jump between branches without losing your stride, when a full build doesn’t break your flow, and when pressing F5 is something you do instinctively because the wait is measured in moments.\nEarly feedback says it plainly:\n“HOLY […] this is FAST.” – early previewer\n“It’s blazing fast on all my projects.” – Visual Studio MVP\nA modern look and feel\nClarity matters when you live in an IDE. Visual Studio 2026 introduces a cleaner and more modern visual language. The result is a workspace that feels calm and intentional.\nYou’ll notice crisper lines, improved iconography, and better spacing of visual elements. Options feel approachable rather than overwhelming, so tuning the IDE to your preferences is quick instead of delicate.\nManaging extensions is straightforward, and a plethora of new color themes help your environment feel personal – comfortable for long sessions, focused when the pressure is on, and accessible by default.\nIt’s a design that respects your attention and helps you stay oriented, even in the largest solutions.\n\nVisual Studio 2026 redesigned using Fluent UI and ships with 11 new tinted themes\nTry it today\nReady to see the future of Visual Studio? You can get started right now:\nDownload Visual Studio 2026 Insider\nGet GitHub Copilot Free\nRead the release notes\nDeveloper Community Feedback\nVisual Studio 2026 installs side-by-side with earlier versions, and if you’re on Visual Studio 2022 you can import components and settings to get coding right away.\nThis is just the beginning. We’ll ship monthly updates that bring the latest performance improvements, design refinements, and AI innovations. And over the coming weeks, we’ll share deeper dives right here on the blog, so make sure to come back soon.\nThank you\nVisual Studio has always been about more than code – it’s about the community of developers who build, grow, and push us to make the IDE better every day. Thank you for being part of this journey and for making Visual Studio the IDE trusted by millions worldwide.\nHappy coding,\nThe Visual Studio Team\nKnown issue\nThere’s a known issue that can cause errors to show up for some users. Learn more about the issue and follow the ticket for more information.\nThe post Visual Studio 2026 Insiders is here! appeared first on Visual Studio Blog.",

        "contentSnippet": "사진 편집, 아직도 어렵고 복잡하게 느끼시나요? 포토샵의 높은 문턱에 좌절했던 분들이라면 주목해주세요! 2025년, 구글 Gemini의 강력한 AI 모델 '나노바나나'가 사진 편집의 판도를 바꾸고 있습니다. 초보자도 전문가처럼, 단 몇 번의 대화만으로 놀라운 결과물을 얻을 수 있는 이 혁신적인 도구에 대해 자세히 알아보겠습니다.\n  포토샵은 옛말? AI 기반 이미지 편집의 도래\n\n\n예전에는 멋진 사진을 만들려면 포토샵 같은 전문 프로그램을 다루는 기술이 필수적이었죠. 하지만 수십 가지의 도구와 슬라이더, 복잡한 레이어 개념까지… 숙련된 편집자가 아니라면 원하는 결과를 얻기란 여간 어려운 일이 아니었습니다. 저 역시 처음 포토샵을 배울 때 수많은 튜토리얼을 찾아보며 진땀을 뺐던 기억이 생생합니다. 바로 이런 지점에서 AI 기술이 사진 편집의 새로운 지평을 열고 있습니다.\n최근 저는 제 셀피를 픽셀(Pixel)의 AI 편집 기능으로 수정해봤는데, 결과가 정말 훌륭했어요. 그러나 이제는 Gemini를 통해 편집하면 포토샵이 필요 없을 정도로 놀라운 경험을 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 특히 Gemini의 최신 모델인 ‘나노바나나(Nano Banana)’는 이미지 편집에 특화되어, 마치 마법처럼 사진을 변신시켜줍니다.\n✂️ 포토샵, 그 익숙함 뒤의 불편함\n포토샵은 분명 놀라운 소프트웨어입니다. 전문적인 결과물을 만들어낼 수 있는 다양한 도구들을 제공하며, 일부는 AI 기술로 구동되기도 하죠. 막히는 부분이 있다면 인터넷에 넘쳐나는 튜토리얼이 큰 도움이 됩니다. 하지만 포토샵을 제대로 활용하려면 몇 가지 넘어야 할 산이 있습니다.\n높은 진입 장벽: 기술과 비용\n기술적 난이도: 포토샵은 일정 수준의 기술 숙련도를 요구합니다. 수많은 기능들을 익히는 데 상당한 시간과 노력이 필요하죠.\n고사양 컴퓨터: 프로그램을 원활하게 실행하려면 강력한 사양의 컴퓨터가 필요합니다.\n구독료 부담: 어도비(Adobe)의 구독료는 적지 않은 재정적 투자를 요구합니다. 첫 사진을 열어보기도 전에 비용 지불이 선행되어야 합니다.\n복잡한 사용법과 시간 투자\n물론 포토샵이 제공하는 정밀한 제어 기능은 훌륭합니다. 하지만 사실 전문 사진작가나 그래픽 디자이너가 아니라면 그 모든 기능이 다 필요하지 않을 때가 많습니다. 대부분의 일반적인 사진 편집에는 포토샵이 제공하는 복잡성이 과도하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 가파른 학습 곡선 때문에 원하는 결과물을 얻기까지 오랜 시간 시행착오를 겪어야 한다는 점도 큰 부담입니다.\n  팁! 전문적인 작업이 아니라면, 포토샵 대신 무료로 이용할 수 있는 다양한 대체 프로그램들도 많습니다. 하지만 AI 편집 도구는 그마저도 뛰어넘는 간편함을 제공하죠.\n  나노바나나의 등장: 이미지 편집의 새로운 기준\nGemini의 2.5 Flash 모델, 코드명 나노바나나(Nano Banana)는 이미지 편집의 패러다임을 완전히 바꾸고 있습니다. 이제 수백 개의 슬라이더와 도구를 조작하는 대신, 여러분이 원하는 변경 사항을 단순히 입력하거나 말하기만 하면 Gemini가 알아서 편집을 처리해 줍니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n간편함의 미학: 직관적인 AI 편집\n나노바나나를 사용하는 방법은 매우 간단합니다. 데스크톱에서 Gemini 웹사이트에 접속하거나 Gemini 앱을 열고 ‘이미지 생성(Create images)’ 모드를 선택합니다. 그 다음, “+” 아이콘을 눌러 편집하고 싶은 이미지를 업로드하고 원하는 편집 내용을 텍스트로 입력하기만 하면 됩니다. 정말 이보다 더 쉬울 수 있을까요?\n구독료도, 고사양 컴퓨터도 필요 없습니다. 그냥 원하는 편집을 Gemini에게 알려주기만 하면 끝입니다. 나노바나나는 특히 다음과 같은 작업에 매우 강력한 성능을 보여줍니다.\n기능\n설명\n\n\n\n\n객체 제거 및 추가\n사진 속 불필요한 요소를 지우거나 새로운 객체를 자연스럽게 추가합니다.\n\n\n배경 교체\n원하는 배경으로 사진의 분위기를 완전히 바꿀 수 있습니다.\n\n\n이미지 간 스타일 전환\n특정 이미지의 스타일을 다른 이미지에 적용하여 독특한 결과물을 만듭니다.\n\n\n색상 및 조명 조정\n사진의 색감과 밝기를 최적화하여 분위기를 살립니다.\n\n\n여러 사진 합성\n두 장 이상의 사진을 자연스럽게 하나로 합쳐줍니다.\n\n\n\n ️ 대화형 편집: 창의력의 날개를 달다\n나노바나나로 사진을 편집할 때 가장 매력적인 점은 바로 ‘다단계 대화형 편집’이 가능하다는 것입니다. 한 번의 프롬프트에서 모든 변경 사항을 지정할 필요 없이, 마치 친구와 대화하듯 편집을 이어나갈 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 첫 번째 요청으로 하늘을 바꾸고, 다음 요청으로 조명을 미세하게 조절하거나 배경 요소를 추가·삭제하는 식이죠.\n단계별 편집의 자유\n이러한 대화형 편집 방식은 여러분의 편집 경험 자체를 변화시킵니다. 더 이상 복잡한 도구와 기술 수준에 얽매이지 않고, 오롯이 자신의 창의적인 아이디어 구현에 집중할 수 있게 됩니다. 편집 속도가 빠르고 노력도 적게 들기 때문에, 다양한 아이디어를 주저 없이 시도해볼 수 있다는 것도 큰 장점입니다. 이제는 기술이 아니라 여러분의 창의적인 비전이 편집의 중심이 됩니다.\n음성 편집, 아직은 성장 중\n만약 타이핑이 번거롭다면, 음성 모드로 전환해 Gemini에게 말로 편집을 요청할 수도 있습니다. 하지만 제 경험상 아직 음성 모드는 완벽하게 작동하지는 않았습니다. 가끔 설명 없는 오류가 반복적으로 발생하곤 했어요. 원인은 알 수 없지만, 텍스트 입력은 언제나 안정적으로 작동했으니 참고하시면 좋겠습니다.\n✍️ 나노바나나 프롬프트, 이렇게 활용해 보세요!\n나노바나나의 AI 편집 능력은 여러분의 프롬프트에 달려있습니다. 원하는 결과를 얻기 위해서는 명확하고 구체적인 설명이 중요합니다. 다음은 효과적인 프롬프트를 작성하기 위한 몇 가지 팁입니다.\n구체적인 지시: 단순히 ‘배경을 바꿔줘’보다는 ‘배경을 울창한 열대우림으로 바꿔주고, 빛은 나뭇잎 사이로 스며드는 듯한 효과를 줘’와 같이 구체적으로 설명해주세요.\n명확한 목표: ‘사진을 더 밝게’보다는 ‘전체적으로 따뜻한 색감으로 밝기를 한 단계 올려줘’와 같이 목표를 명확히 제시합니다.\n단계별 접근: 복잡한 편집은 한 번에 처리하기보다 여러 단계로 나누어 요청하는 것이 좋습니다. 예를 들어, 먼저 객체를 제거하고, 그 다음 배경을 교체한 후, 마지막으로 색상 보정을 하는 식입니다.\n예시 활용: 특정 스타일이나 느낌을 원한다면, ‘인상주의 화풍으로 바꿔줘’처럼 예시를 들어 설명할 수도 있습니다.\n  팁! 처음에는 간단한 편집부터 시작하여 나노바나나의 작동 방식을 익히는 것이 좋습니다. 점점 더 복잡한 요청을 시도하며 여러분만의 노하우를 쌓아가세요!\n⏱️ 복잡한 작업도 순식간에: 시간 절약의 마법\n포토샵에서 배경을 바꾸는 단순한 작업조차 숙련자에게도 몇 분, 초보자에게는 몇 시간이 걸릴 수 있습니다. 레이어 작업이나 마스킹을 통해 객체를 제거하거나 배경을 교체하고, 요소를 옮기는 데 많은 집중과 시간이 필요하죠. 하지만 나노바나나에서는 같은 작업을 불과 몇 초 만에 끝낼 수 있습니다.\n제가 직접 경험한 일화가 있습니다. 친구가 자전거 사고를 당해서 병원에 있었고, 사고 난 자전거 사진을 보내주기를 원했어요. 손상된 자전거가 수리점으로 운반 중인 사진이었는데, 저는 나노바나나에게 사진을 산속에 주차된 것처럼 편집해 달라고 요청했습니다. 결과는 정말 놀라웠어요! 자전거와 헬멧까지 정확하게 표현했고, 심지어 그림자, 조명, 흙먼지까지 자연스럽게 반영되어 있었죠. 이 정도 편집을 포토샵에서 했다면 훨씬 오랜 시간이 걸렸을 뿐 아니라 반드시 책상 앞에 앉아 작업해야 했을 겁니다. 나노바나나는 워터마크 제거, 배경 교체, 객체 추가·삭제를 거의 요청과 동시에 수행해냅니다.\n✅ 일관성 유지: AI 편집의 신뢰성 확보\n기존 AI 편집 도구의 가장 큰 문제점 중 하나는 바로 ‘일관성’이었습니다. 특히 인물의 얼굴이나 주요 피사체가 편집 과정에서 미묘하게 바뀌어 버리는 경우가 많았죠. 나 자신이나 지인의 사진을 편집할 때 작은 변화만 있어도 어색하게 느껴질 수 있습니다. 비슷하지만 똑같지 않은 AI 편집 결과물은 사실상 쓸모가 없었습니다.\n인물, 반려동물 사진 편집의 안정성\n하지만 구글은 Gemini, 특히 나노바나나를 개발하면서 이러한 문제점을 해결하는 데 집중했습니다. 나노바나나는 사람, 가족, 친구, 반려동물의 사진을 편집할 때 원래 모습의 일관성을 유지할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 따라서 어떤 편집을 하든 인물의 모습은 그대로 유지될 가능성이 매우 큽니다. 이제 AI가 임의로 추가하는 왜곡된 결과물이 아닌, 여러분이 지정한 편집만 정확히 반영된 결과물을 기대할 수 있습니다.\n여러 사진 합성도 자연스럽게\n이러한 일관성 유지 기능은 특히 여러 이미지를 합성하여 한 장의 결과물을 만들 때 더욱 유용합니다. 두 장의 사진 속에 있던 사람들이 하나의 프레임에 함께 있어도 각자의 모습이 자연스럽게 유지되는 것을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이제 여러분의 소중한 추억을 AI의 도움으로 더욱 아름답게 만들 수 있습니다.\n  핵심 요약\n✅ 간편한 접근성: 포토샵과 달리 고사양 PC나 유료 구독 없이 Gemini 웹사이트나 앱에서 즉시 이용 가능합니다.\n✅ 직관적인 대화형 편집: 복잡한 도구 없이 자연어 프롬프트(텍스트 또는 음성)로 원하는 편집을 명령할 수 있습니다.\n✅ 시간 절약과 효율성: 배경 교체, 객체 제거 등 복잡한 작업도 수 초 만에 처리하여 작업 시간을 혁신적으로 단축합니다.\n✅ 일관성 유지: 인물이나 주요 피사체의 원래 모습을 정확히 보존하며, 여러 사진 합성 시에도 자연스러운 결과물을 제공합니다.\n나노바나나는 전문가뿐만 아니라 일반 사용자에게도 사진 편집의 즐거움을 선사하는 강력한 도구입니다. 지금 바로 경험해보세요!\n ️ 대화형 편집: 창의력의 날개를 달다\n1.  애니메이션을 실제 모델로 변경\nGenerate a photo of a girl cosplaying this illustration, with the background set at Comiket\n\n\n \n2.  다양한 헤어스타일로 변경\n\n\nGenerate avatars of this person with different hairstyles in a 3x3 grid format\n \n 3.  드로잉과 사진의 합성\n\n\nChange the pose of the person in Figure 1 to that of Figure 2, and shoot in a professional studio\n❓ 자주 묻는 질문 (FAQ)\nQ1: 나노바나나는 포토샵을 완전히 대체할 수 있나요?\nA1: 나노바나나는 일반적인 사진 편집 작업을 매우 쉽고 빠르게 처리하여 포토샵의 필요성을 크게 줄여줍니다. 하지만 그래픽 디자인이나 고도로 정밀한 수작업이 필요한 전문적인 작업에서는 여전히 포토샵이 주된 도구로 사용될 수 있습니다. 나노바나나는 포토샵의 훌륭한 대안이자 보완재 역할을 합니다.\nQ2: 나노바나나를 사용하려면 별도 프로그램 설치나 구독이 필요한가요?\nA2: 아니요, Gemini의 2.5 Flash 모델인 나노바나나는 Gemini 웹사이트나 앱에서 ‘이미지 생성’ 모드를 통해 바로 사용할 수 있습니다. 별도의 프로그램 설치나 유료 구독 없이 무료로 주요 편집 기능을 이용할 수 있어 접근성이 매우 뛰어납니다.\nQ3: AI 편집 시 인물이나 배경이 부자연스러워지지는 않나요?\nA3: 나노바나나는 인물, 가족, 친구, 반려동물 등의 주요 피사체를 편집할 때 원래 모습의 일관성을 유지하도록 설계되었습니다. 배경 교체나 객체 추가 시에도 자연스러운 그림자, 조명, 질감을 반영하여 전체적인 조화를 해치지 않는 뛰어난 결과물을 제공합니다.\n포토샵은 여전히 그래픽 디자이너와 전문 사진작가들의 강력한 도구로 남을 것입니다. 하지만 Gemini의 나노바나나는 훌륭한 대안이자 혁신적인 미래를 제시합니다. 복잡한 제어나 기술적인 도구 다루는 것에 어려움을 느끼는 분들에게, 나노바나나는 사진을 쉽고 빠르게 원하는 대로 편집할 수 있는 최고의 도구가 될 것입니다. 지금 바로 나노바나나로 여러분의 사진 편집 경험을 한 단계 업그레이드해보세요!\n\n \n나노바나나를 가장 스마트하게 사용하는 법. 바나나 캔버스 무료 공개\nAI 이미지 생성과 편집의 새로운 지평을 연 구글의 제미나이 2.5 Flash Image, 일명 나노바나나를 가장 스마트하게 활용하는 법을 소개합니다. 특히 나노바나나의 강력한 기능을 누구나 쉽게 사용할\nmuzbox.tistory.com",

(2가지 경로)\n이 GEM은 분석의 시작에서부터 아주 똑똑하게 접근해요. 먼저 오디오 파일의 주된 콘텐츠가 음성인지 음악인지 판별하는 '오디오 유형 식별' 단계를 거칩니다. 그리고 그 결과에 따라 최적화된 분석 경로를 선택해 진행하게 되죠. 마치 길을 잘 아는 전문가처럼요.\n경로 A: 음성 기반 오디오 분석\n회의록, 인터뷰, 강의 녹음본 같은 음성 기반 오디오는 정말 중요한 정보를 담고 있죠. 이 GEM은 단순히 받아쓰기하는 것을 넘어, 대화의 본질을 파악합니다.\n✅ 내용 분석: 3~5문장의 핵심 요약부터 주요 주제, 키워드 추출, 그리고 가장 중요한 실행 항목 및 결정 사항(담당자, 기한 포함)까지 리스트업 해줍니다. 심지어 오디오에 포함된 모든 음성 대화를 화자 분리까지 완벽하게 변환하여 전문으로 제공해요.\n✅ 감성 및 표현 방식 분석: 대화의 전반적인 감정, 화자별 감정 변화, 어조(Tone) 분석은 물론, 발화 속도, 리듬, 의미 있는 침묵, 필러 단어 사용 빈도 같은 비언어적 요소까지 분석하여 그 의미를 추론해줍니다. 정말 놀랍지 않나요?\n✅ 기술 및 환경 분석: 사용된 언어, 총 화자 수, 재생 시간은 물론, 배경 소음이나 웃음, 기침 같은 특정 음향 이벤트까지 식별하고 오디오 선명도 같은 기술적 품질까지 평가해줍니다.\n✅ 종합 인사이트: 이 모든 분석을 바탕으로 내용, 감정, 표현 방식을 아우르는 최종적인 통찰력과 결론을 제공하니, 그냥 회의록을 읽는 것과는 차원이 다르죠.\n\n\n경로 B: 음악 기반 오디오 분석\n음악은 복잡한 예술 형태인데, 이걸 어떻게 분석할까 궁금하셨을 거예요. 이 GEM은 음악의 아주 미묘한 부분까지 파고듭니다.\n✅ 음악 개요 및 핵심 특징: 추정 장르, 분위기, 주요 악기 구성은 기본이고, BPM, 박자표, 리듬 특징, 화성 및 조성(키, 스케일, 코드 진행)까지 상세하게 해석해줍니다.\n✅ 내용 및 구조 분석: 보컬이 있다면 가사 전문을 완벽하게 변환하고, 연주곡일 경우 명확히 알려줘요. 곡의 구조를 인트로, 벌스, 코러스 등으로 자동 분할하고 각 구간의 특징까지 설명해줍니다.\n✅ 사운드 및 악기 분석: 정말 신기한 부분인데요, Spectral Centroid (밝기), Spectral Bandwidth (대역폭), Zero Crossing Rate (타격감/고주파 잡음), Spectral Rolloff (고역 에너지) 같은 스펙트럼 특징값을 분석해서 각 값이 음색에 미치는 영향을 설명하고, 이를 토대로 주요 악기까지 추정하고 분류해준답니다.\n✅ 음악적 특성 및 기술 사양: 스포티파이 스타일의 에너지, 댄스 가능성, 정서적 밝기 같은 음악적 특성과 총 길이, 샘플레이트, 채널 같은 기본 기술 사양도 기록해요.\n  시각적 분석: 파형, 스펙트로그램, 구조 시각화\n이 GEM의 또 다른 강점은 분석 결과를 시각적으로 보여준다는 거예요. 시간에 따른 음량 변화를 파형으로 시각화해주고, 시간에 따른 주파수 분포를 보여주는 스펙트로그램으로 저음, 중음, 고음역대의 에너지 분포를 한눈에 파악할 수 있게 해줍니다. 음악의 구조(인트로, 코러스 등)도 타임라인 위에 시각적으로 표시해주니, 정말 직관적이고 이해하기 쉬웠어요.\n  놓치지 마세요: 단순히 텍스트 분석이 아닌, 시각화를 통해 오디오의 복잡한 정보를 더욱 명확하게 전달한다는 점이 이 GEM의 차별점입니다!\n  왜 이 GEM 지침이 게임 체인저일까요?\nGemini에서 오디오 파일 업로드를 지원하게 되면서, 이런 통합 분석 GEM 지침이 탄생했다는 것은 정말 큰 의미가 있습니다. 제 생각엔 이 GEM은 단순히 새로운 도구가 아니라, 우리가 오디오 데이터를 다루는 방식 자체를 바꿀 수 있는 게임 체인저라고 생각해요. 개발자, 연구자, 콘텐츠 크리에이터 모두에게 엄청난 잠재력을 열어줄 것이 분명합니다.\n  복잡한 분석의 간소화: 수동으로 진행하기 어렵고 시간이 많이 드는 음성 및 음악 분석 작업을 GEM이 한 번에 처리해줍니다.\n  새로운 인사이트 발굴: 기존에는 놓쳤을 법한 비언어적 요소나 스펙트럼 특징값 분석을 통해 더욱 깊이 있는 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.\n  접근성의 확대: 전문가가 아닌 일반 사용자도 복잡한 오디오 분석을 손쉽게 수행할 수 있게 됩니다.\n  시각화를 통한 이해 증진: 복잡한 데이터를 직관적인 시각 자료로 제공하여 이해도를 높여줍니다.\n⚠️ 주의: 강력한 도구인 만큼, 분석 결과는 사용자의 목적과 맥락에 맞춰 신중하게 해석하고 활용해야 합니다. 인공지능의 분석은 참고 자료로 활용하며 최종적인 판단은 항상 사람이 해야 한다는 점을 잊지 마세요!\n  통합 오디오 분석 GEM 지침, 지금 바로 무료로 만나보세요!\n이처럼 혁신적인 '통합 오디오 분석 GEM 지침'을 여러분께 무료로 배포한다는 소식은 정말 반갑죠.

        "content": "<p>오랜만에 인사드립니다. 스포카에서 제품 디자인을 하고 있는 김동환(Donny)입니다.</p>\n\n<p>이전에 <a href=\"https://brunch.co.kr/@okid2318/18\">개인 블로그에 바이브 코딩으로 Swift 앱을 제작한 이야기</a>를 공유한 적이 있었는데요, 이번에는 피그마 플러그인을 직접 제작하고, 업무에 적용한 경험을 나눠보고자 합니다.</p>\n\n<p>매일 2~3시간, 총 3일 정도 걸려 완성했습니다. 사실 이런 단순한 통신과 Mapping을 다루는 플러그인은 이미 흔한 사례지만, 대부분은 TF 단위로 기획되고 만들어집니다.</p>\n\n<p>그런 점에서 이번 이야기는 PD 혼자서 가볍게 기획하고 제작할 수 있다는 가능성에 더 큰 의미가 있다고 생각합니다.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2 id=\"프로젝트-커틀러리\">프로젝트 커틀러리</h2>\n\n<p>시간적인 이유로 아래와 같은 화면으로 디자인/설계 공유를 하는 분들이 많으실 것 같습니다. 저도 마찬가지였습니다.</p>\n\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/images/2025-09-08/1.png\" />\n</figure>\n\n<p>더미 데이터는 공유받는 사람, UT 참여자의 진지한 몰입에 도움이 됩니다. 하지만, 한땀한땀 넣기에는 시간, 체력, 멘탈적인 문제가 있을 수밖에 없습니다.</p>\n\n<p>특히 B2B SaaS 제품 같은 경우, 테이블이 아주 많습니다.

        "content:encodedSnippet": "얼마 전에 한 팟캐스트에서 습관에 대해 연구하는 작가의 인터뷰를 들었다. 이분이 최근에 출시한 책은 습관은 무엇이고, 어떻게 하면 큰 목표를 달성하기 위한 습관을 형성할 수 있는지에 대한 내용인데, 이 책을 출간하면서 가장 많이 참고했던 게 군대이고, 가장 많이 인터뷰했던 사람들이 군인이라고 한다. 특히 작가가 했던 말 중 내 기억에 인상 깊게 남았던 말은 “군대는 습관을 인위적으로 형성하는 거대한 기계”였다. 이 말을 하면서 예로 들었던 건, 이제 갓 고등학교를 졸업하고 입대한, 정말로 아무것도 모르는 18살짜리 애도 수색하다가 폭탄이 발견되면 완전히 기계같이 행동한다는 내용이었다.\n위의 예처럼 폭탄이 발견되면 기계같이 행동하는 군인들이 있지만, 또 그렇게 하지 않는 군인도 있는데, 어쨌든 전반적으로 군대 자체가 모두의 습관을 형성하는 거대한 기계의 역할을 하므로, 입대하면 어쩔 수 없이 이런 습관들이 다른 업종 사람들보다 더 잘 형성된다는 내용이었다. 나는 이 팟캐스트를 들으면서, 군대만큼 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계는 바로 스타트업이라는 생각을 했다.\n내가 아는 모든 창업가 중 사업을 오랫동안, 꾸준히 잘하는 분들은 모두 다 습관의 동물들이다. 실은 나도 스트롱벤처스를 만들었으니까 굳이 분류하자면 창업가라고 할 수 있는데, 나에게도 스트롱벤처스는 지난 13년 동안 습관을 – 좋은 습관도 있고 좋지 않은 습관도 있지만, 대부분 너무 좋은 습관 – 형성해 준 작은 기계와도 같다. 아마도 투자자로서의 습관, 그리고 실제로 사업을 운영하는 창업가로서의 습관은 조금 다르겠지만, 내가 창업가들을 관찰하면서 느끼는, 이들이 스타트업을 하기 때문에 형성된 가장 두드러진 습관은 우선순위를 파악하는 인지적 습관이다. 사업을 하다 보면 해야 할 일은 너무 많은데, 그 모든 것을 할 수 있는 시간과 돈은 턱없이 부족하다. 그리고 주위에서 잔소리와 훈계를 얼마나 많이 하는지. 이 모든 것을 무시하면서, 실제로 나에게 도움을 주는 조언과 도움이 전혀 되지 않는 잡음을 구분하고, 우리 회사에 도움이 되는 일에만 우선순위를 매기는 습관은 내가 아는 사람 중 창업가들이 가장 잘 한다.\n스타트업이 창업가들에게 기계적으로 형성시켜 주는 또 다른 습관은 행동하고, 이를 계속 반복하는 행동이다. 내가 자주 사용하는 말 중 하나가 “founders are machines of iteration”인데, 한정된 자원으로 좋은 제품을 만들다 보면, 어쩔 수 없이 이론보단 실제로 뭔가를 만들어 테스팅하고, 답이 없는 문제에 대해 오래 끙끙 고민하기보단 그냥 바로 실행하는 게 창업가들이다. 아주 훌륭한 습관이다.\n그리고 또 다른 습관은 위기에서 빠져나가서 살 수 있는 기회와 패턴을 남들보다 더 잘 볼 수 있는 것도 스타트업이 창업가들에게 단련시키는 습관 중 하나인 것 같다. 위기 앞에서 남들은 감정적으로 휩쓸리면서, 가장 덜 고통스럽게 포기하는 방법을 찾지만, 창업가들은 절대로 포기하지 않고, 이 위기를 극복할 방법을 습관적으로 찾게 되는데, 이건 스타트업이 아니었으면 아마도 형성되기 어려운 습관이지 않을까 생각한다.\n마지막으로, 아무리 좋아도 별로 좋아하지 않고, 아무리 나빠도 별로 낙담하지 않는, 일희일비하지 않는 습관이다. 내가 아는 대부분의 경험 많은 창업가들은 일희일비하지 않는다. 실은, 나도 비슷한 성향이긴 하지만, 그래도 너무 좋을 땐 기뻐하고, 너무 화가 날 땐 슬퍼하는 감정에 빠진다. 하지만, 내가 아는 정말 노련한 창업가들은 “이기면 다음 시합을 준비하고, 져도 다음 시합을 준비한다.”라는 덤덤한 마인드로 사업을 하고 인생을 사는데, 이것 또한 스타트업이라는 습관을 형성해 주는 거대한 기계가 아니면 생길 수 없는 좋은 습관인 것 같다.\n위에서 언급한 습관들은 내가 지난 13년 동안 창업가들과 가깝게 지내면서 항상 감탄하면서 동시에 나도 내 습관으로 만들기 위해서 부단하게 노력하고 있는 그런 좋은 장점들인데, 어떻게 보면 이런 습관은 내가 항상 강조하는 창업가의 바퀴벌레와 같은 특성을 기반으로 형성되기도 하는 것 같다. 원래 바퀴벌레 특성을 가진 사람들이 창업하는 건지, 아니면 창업하게 되면 스타트업이라는 기계가 바퀴벌레의 습관을 형성하는 건진 잘 모르겠지만, 아마 둘 다이지 않을까 싶다.",
